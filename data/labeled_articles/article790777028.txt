The 0
statement 0
came 0
just 0
a 0
day 0
after 0
Senate 0
Democrats 0
continued 0
their 0
smear 1
of 0
Kavanaugh 0
by 0
declaring 0
they 0
believed 0
Dr. 0
Christine 0
Ford's 0
allegations 0
against 0
him 0
while 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
obviously 0
not 0
believing 0
his 0
denial 0
of 0
the 0
allegations. 0

On 0
top 0
of 0
that, 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
zero 0
evidence 0
submitted 0
to 0
the 0
committee 0
that 0
Ford's 0
allegations 0
are 0
true. 0

In 0
fact, 0
everything 0
submitted 0
has 0
refuted 0
her 0
claims, 0
from 0
sworn 0
statements 0
by 0
those 0
she 0
claims 0
were 0
there 0
to 0
Kavanaugh's 0
calendar 0
to 0
character 0
statements 0
by 0
dozens 0
of 0
women 0
who 0
have 0
known 0
him 0
since 0
high 0
school 0
to 0
those 0
he 0
has 0

with 0
in 0
DC. 0

All 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
named 0
by 0
Ford 0
have 0
already 0
submitted 0
statements 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
memory 0
of 0
the 0
event 0
ever 0
occurring, 0
including 0
a 0
female 0
friend 0
of 0
hers 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

Two 0
of 0
those 0
named 0
have 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
cooperate 0
with 0
the 0
FBI. 0

“I 0
will 0
cooperate 0
with 0
any 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agency 0
that 0
is 0
assigned 0
to 0
confidentially 0
investigate 0
these 0
allegations,” 0
Kavanaugh 0
friend 0
Mark 0
Judge 0
said. 0

“My 0
client, 0
Patrick 0
J. 0
Smyth, 0
is 0
happy 0
to 0
cooperate 0
fully 0
with 0
this 0
FBI 0
investigation,” 0
said 0
attorney 0
Eric 0
B. 0
Bruce. 0

Kavanaugh 0
also 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
cooperating 0
as 0
he 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

“Throughout 0
this 0
process, 0
I’ve 0
been 0
interviewed 0
by 0
the 0
FBI, 0
I’ve 0
done 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
‘background’ 0
calls 0
directly 0
with 0
the 0
Senate, 0
and 0
yesterday, 0
I 0
answered 0
questions 0
under 0
oath 0
about 0
every 0
topic 0
the 0
Senators 0
and 0
their 0
counsel 0
asked 0
me," 0
Kavanaugh 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
that 0
was 0
released 0
by 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

"I’ve 0
done 0
everything 0
they 0
have 0
requested 0
and 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
cooperate." 0

Well, 0
Senator 0
Flake 0
has 0
given 0
the 0
Democrats 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
and 0
you 0
can 0
bet 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
still 0
going 0
to 0
vote 0
pretty 0
much 0
on 0
party 0
lines 0
concerning 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Now, 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
gone 0
along 0
with 0
it. 0

My 0
guess 0
is 0
that 0
one 0
of 0
two 0
things 0
will 0
occur 0
with 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigation: 0
(1) 0
Absolutely 1
nothing 1
will 1
be 1
found, 1
and 0
this 0
will 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
huge 1
waste 1
of 1
time 1
or 0
(2) 0
look 0
for 0
this 0
thing 0
to 0
expand 0
and 0
the 0
need 0
will 0
arise 0
to 0
make 0
this 0
more 1
of 1
a 1
circus 1
than 1
it 1
already 1
is, 1
which 0
will 0
dwarf 0
anything 0
Clarence 0
Thomas 0
had 0
to 0
face 0
from 0
the 0
slanderous 1
accusations 0
of 0
Anita 0
Hill. 0

Remember, 0
whether 0
you 0
like 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
or 0
not, 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
nothing 0
but 0
a 0
political 1
hit. 1
