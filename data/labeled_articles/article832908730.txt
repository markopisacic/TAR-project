Mueller 0
Submits 0
His 0
Russia 0
Report 0
to 0
Justice 0
Department 0

Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
concluded 0
his 0
22-month 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
and 0
submitted 0
a 0
report 0
to 0
Attorney 0
General 0
William 0
Barr 0
on 0
Friday, 0
triggering 0
a 0
clamor 0
from 0
Congress 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
findings. 0

A 0
Justice 0
Department 0
official 0
told 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
that 0
Mueller 0
is 0
not 0
recommending 0
any 0
further 0
indictments. 0

In 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
and 0
House 0
judiciary 0
committees, 0
Barr 0
described 0
Mueller’s 0
submission 0
as 0
a 0
“confidential 0
report 0
explaining 0
the 0
prosecution 0
or 0
declination 0
decisions 0
he 0
has 0
reached.” 0

“I 0
am 0
reviewing 0
the 0
report 0
and 0
anticipate 0
that 0
I 0
may 0
be 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
advise 0
you 0
of 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
principal 0
conclusions 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
weekend,” 0
the 0
letter 0
said. 0

Barr 0
did 0
not 0
detail 0
what 0
the 0
report 0
contains, 0
but 0
did 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
did 0
not 0
overrule 0
any 0
decision 0
Mueller 0
made. 0

Barr 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
consult 0
with 0
Mueller 0
and 0
Deputy 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein, 0
who 0
has 0
mostly 0
overseen 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office, 0
about 0
“what 0
other 0
information 0
from 0
the 0
report” 0
can 0
be 0
released 0
to 0
Congress 0
and 0
the 0
public. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
and 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
lawyers 0
said 0
the 0
next 0
decisions 0
are 0
up 0
to 0
Barr. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
that 0
Barr 0
releases 0
two 0
separate 0
reports. 0

One 0
would 0
summarize 0
Mueller’s 0
findings 0
without 0
including 0
classified 0
information 0
and 0
would 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
Congress—and 0
would 0
then 0
most 0
likely 0
find 0
its 0
way 0
out 0
into 0
the 0
public. 0

The 0
other 0
would 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
a 0
smaller 0
group 0
of 0
lawmakers 0
who 0
head 0
major 0
congressional 0
committees, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
House 0
and 0
Senate 0
intelligence 0
committees. 0

Rep. 0
Adam 0
Schiff 0
(D-CA), 0
chairman 0
of 0
House 0
Intelligence, 0
called 0
for 0
transparency. 0

“Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
began 0
as 0
a 0
counterintelligence 0
inquiry 0
into 0
whether 0
individuals 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
were 0
compromised 0
by 0
a 0
foreign 0
power. 0

By 0
law, 0
that 0
evidence 0
he 0
uncovered 0
must 0
be 0
shared 0
with 0
our 0
Committee,” 0
he 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
tweet. 0

“And 0
his 0
report 0
must 0
also 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

Now.” 1

Trump 0
has 0
previously 0
said 0
he 0
supports 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
making 0
the 0
report 0
public. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
mind,” 0
he 0
has 0
said. 0

“I 0
mean, 0
frankly, 0
I 0
told 0
the 0
House, 0
‘If 0
you 0
want, 0
let 0
them 0
see 0
it.’” 0

Trump 0
has 0
also 0
vigorously 0
denied 0
any 0
wrongdoing 0
and 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
branded 0
the 0
probe 0
as 0
a 0
“total 1
witch 1
hunt.” 1

Mueller 0
will 0
remain 0
as 0
special 0
counsel 0
for 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
time 0
as 0
he 0
and 0
a 0
small 0
contingent 0
of 0
staff 0
close 0
the 0
office, 0
a 0
Justice 0
Department 0
spokesperson 0
reportedly 0
said. 0

The 0
handover 0
of 0
the 0
report 0
marks 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
that 0
has 0
for 0
nearly 0
two 0
years 0
transfixed 1
the 1
nation, 1
yielded 0
dozens 0
of 0
indictments 0
and 0
convictions, 0
and 0
brought 0
down 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
closest 0
advisers. 0

The 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
was 0
tasked 0
broadly 0
with 0
investigating 0
any 0
links 0
or 0
coordination 0
between 0
the 0
Russian 0
government 0
and 0
individuals 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
any 0
matters 0
that 0
arose 0
directly 0
from 0
the 0
probe. 0

However, 0
the 0
scope 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
seems 0
to 1
have 1
bled 1
outside 1
those 1
lines. 1

Several 0
witnesses, 0
for 0
example, 0
have 0
been 0
questioned 0
about 0
other 0
countries’ 0
efforts 0
to 0
meddle 0
in 0
American 1
politics, 0
including 0
Saudi 0
Arabia, 0
Israel, 0
the 0
UAE 0
and 0
Qatar. 0

So 0
far, 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
has 0
indicted 0
or 0
obtained 0
guilty 0
pleas 0
from 0
34 0
people 0
and 0
three 0
companies. 0

Six 0
of 0
those 0
are 0
former 0
Trump 0
associates, 0
and 0
25 0
of 0
them 0
are 0
Russians. 0

No 0
Americans 0
have 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
conspiring 0
with 0
Russians 0
to 0
meddle 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
elections—at 0
least 0
none 0
the 0
public 0
knows 0
about. 0

But 0
major 0
Trumpworld 1
figures 1
were 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
other 0
crimes, 0
including 0
former 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
Michael 0
Flynn, 0
former 0
campaign 0
chairman 0
Paul 0
Manafort, 0
deputy 0
campaign 0
chairman 0
Richard 0
Gates 0
and 0
Trump's 0
former 0
personal 0
lawyer 0
and 0
fixer 0
Michael 0
Cohen. 0

Cohen 0
has 0
been 0
sentenced 0
to 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
crimes 0
he 0
committed 0
while 0
working 0
for 0
Trump, 0
including 0
the 0
payments 0
he 0
made 0
to 0
two 0
adult 0
film 0
star 0
actresses 0
for 0
their 0
alleged 0
affairs 0
with 0
his 0
boss. 0

Manafort 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
both 0
Virginia 0
and 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
will 0
serve 0
about 0
seven 0
years 0
in 0
prison. 0

In 0
Washington, 0
Manafort 0
was 0
sentenced 0
for 0
for 0
conspiring 0
against 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
connected 0
to 0
his 0
covert 0
lobbying 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Ukraine’s 0
former 0
pro-Russian 0
government. 0

He 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
Virginia 0
for 0
bank 0
and 0
wire 0
fraud. 0

The 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
court 0
filing 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
gotten 0
all 0
it 0
can 0
out 0
of 0
Flynn, 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
cooperating 0
for 0
months 0
after 0
pleading 0
guilty 0
in 0
December 0
2017 0
to 0
lying 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
about 0
his 0
interactions 0
with 0
Russian 0
Ambassador 0
Sergei 0
Kislyak. 0

It’s 0
unclear 0
when 0
he 0
will 0
be 0
sentenced 0
but 0
his 0
lawyers 0
want 0
to 0
wait 0
until 0
the 0
trial 0
for 0
his 0
former 0
business 0
partners 0
begins 0
in 0
Virginia. 0

Gates 0
has 0
also 0
been 0
cooperating 0
on 0
a 0
wide 0
variety 0
of 0
topics 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation, 0
including 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Manafort. 0

As 0
of 0
March, 0
Gates 0
was 0
still 0
offering 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team 0
information 0
about 0
his 0
time 0
working 0
for 0
Trump. 0

He 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
in 0
February 0
2018 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
and 0
lying 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

Several 0
other 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agencies 0
have 0
picked 0
up 0
pieces 0
of 0
Mueller’s 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
Attorney’s 0
Office 0
for 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
is 0
actively 0
probing 0
the 0
Trump 0
inaugural 0
committee 0
to 0
determine 0
if 0
it 0
received 0
illegal 0
foreign 0
donations 0
and 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
that 0
money 0
flowed 0
through 0
American 0
intermediaries. 0

The 0
Eastern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
has 0
reportedly 0
taken 0
over 0
some 0
aspects 0
of 0
that 0
probe. 0

SDNY 0
is 0
also 0
looking 0
into 0
the 0
hush 0
money 0
payments 0
Trump 0
made 0
to 0
two 0
former 0
adult 0
film 0
actresses 0
via 0
Cohen. 0

A 0
host 0
of 0
other 0
local 0
and 0
state 0
law 0
enforcement 0
offices 0
are 0
working 0
on 0
matters 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
and 0
Trump 0
organization. 0

Congress 0
has 0
also 0
launched 0
several 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
probes 0
into 0
White 0
House 0
security 0
clearances, 0
Trump’s 0
tax 0
