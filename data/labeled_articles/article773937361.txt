Things 0
to 0
Do 0
in 0
an 0
Emergency: 0
“What’s 0
Your 0
Trade?” 0

Well, 0
it’s 0
been 0
quite 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
news 0
weeks 0
for 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
hey? 0

McCarrick, 0
Pineda/Maradiaga, 0
Fr. 0

James 0
Larkin 0
getting 0
the 0
boot 0
in 0
Dublin 0
for 0
upholding 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
on 0
abortion… 0
I 0
know 0
some 0
people 0
are, 0
to 0
put 0
it 0
bluntly, 0
freaking 1
out. 1

The 0
anger 0
of 0
the 0
laity 0
over 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
situation 0
is 0
boiling 0
over 0
into 0
the 0
Twitter 0
feed 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
we 0
still 0
call 0
“the 0
good 0
bishops”. 0

Bishop 0
Thomas 0
Tobin 0
of 0
Providence 0
RI, 0
- 0
nicknamed 0
the 0
“Good 1
Tobin” 1
in 0
contrast 0
to 0
the 0
“Bad 1
Tobin” 1
and 0
FrancisCardinal, 0
Joseph 0
Tobin 0
of 0
Newark 0
– 0
got 0
quite 0
an 0
earful 0
when 0
he 0
tweeted 0
the 0
other 0
day, 0
“Despite 0
the 0
egregious 0
offenses 0
of 0
a 0
few, 0
and 0
despite 0
the 0
faults 0
and 0
sins 0
we 0
all 0
have, 0
I’m 0
very 0
proud 0
of 0
my 0
brother 0
bishops 0
and 0
I 0
admire 0
and 0
applaud 0
the 0
great 0
work 0
they 0
do 0
everyday 0
for 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Church.” 0

The 0
replies 0
haven’t 0
topped 0
out 0
yet, 0
at 0
121, 0
nearly 0
all 0
of 0
them 0
expressing 0
outrage 1
at 0
this 0
cavalier 0
attitude 0
toward 0
the 0
revelation 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
has 0
been 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
a 1
life-long 1
homosexual 1
rapist 1
and 1
sexual 1
predator, 1
grooming 0
and 0
trapping 0
young 0
men 0
and 0
children 0
into 0
unwanted 0
sexual 0
contact; 0
and 0
that 0
nearly 0
the 0
entire 0
episcopate 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
either 0
colluded 0
directly 0
or 0
kept 0
quiet 0
about 0
it. 0

It’s 0
clear 0
that 0
even 0
the 0
“good 0
bishops” 0
have 0
simply 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
close 0
they 0
are 0
to 0
being 0
bodily 0
chucked 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
own 0
churches 0
by 0
furious 0
mobs. 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
elsewhere, 0
since 0
2002, 0
most 0
Catholics 0
know 0
perfectly 1
well, 0
despite 0
the 0
lame 1
whitewashing 0
attempt, 0
that 0
“the 0
US 0
bishops 0
gave 0
themselves 0
a 0
pass” 0
on 0
clerical 0
sex 0
abuse 0
with 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Charter 0
“a 0
thing 0
that 0
brazenly 0
shifted 0
blame.” 0
And 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
though 0
they’re 0
still 0
doing 0
this, 0
quite 0
a 0
few 0
lay 0
Catholics 0
just 0
aren’t 0
having 0
it. 0

We 0
are 0
seeing 0
the 0
final 0
slide, 0
the 0
expected 0
and 0
inevitable 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
100 0
years. 0

The 0
Church 0
was 0
infiltrated, 0
we 0
know 0
this, 0
in 0
the 0
19th 0
century 0
by 0
some 0
pretty 0
dark 1
forces, 1
and 0
they 0
have 0
finally 0
come 0
into 0
the 0
ascendancy 0
and 0
are 0
showing 0
themselves 0
quite 0
clearly 0
for 0
what 0
they 0
are. 0

The 0
McCarrick 0
news 0
– 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
stuff 0
swirling 0
around 0
it 0
like 0
the 0
latest 0
about 0
Bishop 0
Pineda 0
and 0
his 0
connection 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
through 0
Cardinal 0
Maradiaga 0
– 0
has 0
not 0
come 0
in 0
contrast 0
to 0
this 0
but 0
as 0
an 0
intrinsic 0
part 0
of 0
it. 0

The 0
scandal 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
toxic 1
emission, 0
a 0
venting 0
of 0
the 0
gasses 0
that 0
build 0
up 0
naturally 0
around 0
any 0
rotting 1
thing. 0

Rod 0
Dreher[1] 0
is 0
doing 0
excellent 0
work 0
compiling 0
testimony 0
from 0
priests 0
and 0
others 0
saying 0
out 0
loud 0
at 0
last 0
what 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
had 0
known 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
about 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
his 0
gang. 0

It 0
has 0
shown 0
the 0
world 0
what 0
Traditionalists 0
have 0
known, 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
emphatically 0
NOT 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
one 0
“bad 0
apple” 0
or 0
even 0
only 0
a 0
“few” 0
as 0
the 0
hapless 0
“conservative” 0
Bishop 0
Tobin 0
tried 0
to 0
claim 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
a 0
mass-collusion. 0

As 0
our 0
friend 0
Steve 0
Skojec 0
put 0
it 0
the 0
other 0
day, 0
“We’ve 0
got 0
to 0
stop 0
pretending 0
it’s 0
just 0
the 0
progressive 0
element 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
‘conservatives’ 0
are 0
complicit, 0
too.” 0
In 0
short, 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
during 0
his 0
days 0
of 0
glory, 0
globe 0
trotting 0
on 0
the 0
dime 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
Department, 0
hosting 0
presidents 0
for 0
dinner 0
and 0
inviting 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Mother 0
Theresa 0
to 0
tea, 0
so 0
it 0
is 0
now: 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm. 0

Whether 0
he 0
now 0
has 0
to 0
go 0
live 0
in 0
obscurity 0
in 0
some 0
beach 0
house 0
in 0
the 0
Caymans, 0
it 0
will 0
remain 0
true: 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
the 0
“New 0
Church.” 0

A 0
point 0
that 0
Dreher’s 0
informants 0
have 0
brought 0
up 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
emphatic: 0
the 0
homosexualist 1
cabal 1
that 0
is 0
currently 0
reported 0
to 0
be 0
dominant 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
hierarchy 0
(and 0
don’t 0
imagine 0
this 0
is 0
confined 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
English 0
speaking 0
world) 0
have 0
a 0
well 0
documented 0
methodology 0
of 0
mutual 0
protection-and-threat 0
that 0
keeps 0
the 0
whole 0
apparatus 0
afloat. 0

In 0
briefest 0
and 0
simplest 0
possible 0
terms, 0
immoral 0
or 0
even 0
illegal 0
sexual 0
activity 0
is 0
preferred 0
because 0
it 0
leaves 0
a 0
man 0
open 0
to 0
blackmail, 0
to 0
control 0
through 0
fear 0
of 0
exposure[2]. 0

When 0
that 0
blackmailing 0
culture 0
becomes 0
ascendant, 0
it 0
will 0
always 0
reject 0
the 0
morally 0
upright 0
as 0
too 0
dangerous, 0
too 0
difficult 0
to 0
control. 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
faithful 0
seminarians 0
are 0
rejected 0
and 0
why 0
faithful 0
priests 0
are 0
harassed. 0

As 0
Dreher 0
reported, 0

When 0
predatory 1
gay 1
priests 1
run 0
seminaries, 0
they 0
select 0
on 0
a 0
bias 0
for 0
gay 0
candidates... 0

Gay 0
seminarians 0
who 0
intend 0
to 0
be 0
celibate, 0
Sipe 0
said, 0
face 0
tremendous 0
pressure 0
to 0
have 0
sex. 0

If 0
they 0
slip 0
up 0
even 0
once, 0
their 0
failure 0
will 0
be 0
noted, 0
and 0
shared… 0
And 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
made 0
to 0
understand 0
that 0
their 0
lapse 0
is 0
remembered. 0

Later, 0
as 0
a 0
priest, 0
predators 0
within 0
the 0
priesthood 0
have 0
that 0
knowledge 0
to 0
hold 0
over 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
other 0
gay 0
priests, 0
to 0
keep 0
them 0
silent 0
if 0
they 0
ever 0
have 0
the 0
desire 0
to 0
blow 0
whistles. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
covering 0
the 0
scandal 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
2000s, 0
I 0
spoke 0
to 0
several, 0
unconnected 0
heterosexual 0
men 0
— 0
priests, 0
former 0
priests, 0
seminarians 0
— 0
who 0
said 0
that 0
gay 0
seminary 0
rectors 0
or 0
diocesan 0
officials 0
encouraged 0
them 0
to 0
take 0
female 0
sexual 0
partners, 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
too 0
would 0
be 0
complicit 0
in 0
sexual 0
secret-keeping, 0
and 0
therefore 0
no 0
longer 0
[be] 0
a 0
potential 0
danger. 0

Nothing 0
in 0
a 0
system 0
like 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
greater 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
corrupt 0
than 0
men 0
who 0
are 0
not 0
corrupt. 0

For 0
many 0
priests, 0
one 0
might 0
say 0
all 0
good 0
priests, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
sustainable 0
situation, 0
to 0
say 0
the 0
least. 0

I’ve 0
had 0
quite 0
a 0
few 0
conversations 0
with 0
priests 0
who 0
are 0
now 0
asking 0
how 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
it. 0

How 0
are 0
they 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
offer 0
the 0
sacraments 0
in 0
this 0
situation? 0

Where 0
are 0
they 0
to 0
live? 0

How 0
are 0
they 0
to 0
maintain 0
themselves? 0

These 0
are 0
the 0
priests 0
who 0
did 0
make 0
it 0
through 0
this 0
institutional 0
gauntlet, 0
who 0
remain 0
faithful 0
now 0
but 0
are 0
still 0
under 0
the 0
control 0
of 0
these 0
often 0
grossly 1
corrupt 1
and 1
evil 1
men. 1

As 0
men 0
known 0
to 0
be 0
incorruptible 0
themselves, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
big 0
target 0
painted 0
on 0
their 0
backs. 0

In 0
short, 0
not 0
only 0
can 0
a 0
bad 0
bishop 0
harry 0
a 0
man 0
out 0
of 0
his 0
ministry, 0
he 0
has 0
complete 0
control 0
over 0
the 0
priest’s 0
material 0
life. 0

The 0
bishop 0
can, 0
with 0
the 0
flick 0
of 0
a 0
pen 0
or 0
a 0
single 0
phone 0
call, 0
render 0
a 0
priest 0
homeless, 0
penniless 0
and 0
jobless. 0

And 0
these, 0
remember, 0
are 0
men, 0
often 0
well 0
on 0
in 0
years, 0
whose 0
only 0
education 0
and 0
employment 0
training 0
has 0
likely 0
been 0
academic 0
degrees 0
in 0
philosophy 0
and 0
theology, 0
and 0
whose 0
only 0
professional 0
contacts 0
are 0
ecclesiastical. 0

Moreover, 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
globalisation 0
of 0
the 0
bishop-network, 0
a 0
man 0
blackballed 0
for 0
his 0
authentic 0
Catholicity 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
pariah 0
in 0
every 0
diocese 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

And 0
with 0
the 0
advent 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
Rome, 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
more 0
havens; 0
as 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
former 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
have 0
learned, 0
the 0
blackballing 0
has 0
gone 0
global 0
with 0
this 0
pontificate. 0

He 0
will 0
remain 0
a 0
pariah 0
even 0
among 0
the 0
so-called 0
“good” 0
bishops 0
who 0
live 0
in 0
terror 0
of 0
the 0
immense 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
cabal… 0
(see 0
above 0
re: 0
McCarrick 0
& 0
President 0
Bush/John 0
Paul 0
II.) 0

I 0
have 0
been 0
hearing 0
from 0
priests 0
who 0
are 0
saying 0
in 0
effect, 0
“We’re 0
trapped 0
in 0
this 0
situation 0
and 0
forced 0
to 0
remain 0
silent 0
because 0
if 0
we 0
don’t 0
we’ll 0
not 0
only 0
be 0
unable 0
to 0
function 0
as 0
priests, 0
but 0
we’ll 0
be 0
homeless 0
and 0
penniless. 0

We’re 0
unemployable 0
in 0
any 0
other 0
field.” 0
And 0
as 0
much 0
as 0
we 0
might 0
be 0
tempted 0
to 0
say, 0
“Well 1
suck 1
it 1
up, 1
this 0
is 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
souls,” 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
that 0
these 0
are 0
not 0
small 0
considerations. 0

Many 0
priests 0
are 0
getting 0
older 0
– 0
many 0
of 0
them 0
with 0
health 0
issues 0
– 0
and 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
has 0
already 0
given 0
20 0
or 0
30 0
years 0
of 0
his 0
life 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
faced 0
with 0
a 0
practical 0
impossibility 0
if 0
he 0
finds 0
himself 0
blacklisted. 0

Of 0
course 0
there 0
are 0
some 0
who 0
don’t 0
fit 0
this 0
mould; 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
second 0
careers 0
in 0
the 0
priesthood 0
and 0
plenty 0
of 0
people 0
go 0
into 0
seminary 0
after 0
some 0
years 0
in 0
the 0
normal 0
workforce 0
and 0
can 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
it 0
at 0
need. 0

Some 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
now 0
coming 0
forward 0
with 0
complaints 0
against 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
left 0
the 0
priesthood 0
over 0
their 0
experiences, 0
have 0
gone 0
on 0
to 0
have 0
normal, 0
healthy 0
working 0
lives. 0

But 0
I 0
think 0
honestly 0
most 0
priests 0
are 0
in 0
this 0
corner 0
and 0
they 0
know 0
it 0
and 0
so 0
do 0
their 0
bishops. 0

I 0
think 0
a 0
young 0
man 0
goes 0
forward 0
in 0
great 0
faith, 0
spends 0
ten 0
to 0
fifteen 0
years 0
studying 0
philosophy 0
and 0
theology 0
- 0
fields 0
that 0
have 0
almost 0
no 0
application 0
in 0
the 0
workforce 0
outside 0
academia 0
or 0
the 0
Church 0
- 0
with 0
the 0
honest, 0
and 0
frankly 0
fair, 0
expectation 0
of 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
employment 0
and 0
a 0
safety 0
net 0
at 0
the 0
end. 0

As 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
“The 0
old 0
arrangement 0
was, 0
‘Remain 0
faithful, 0
do 0
the 0
work, 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
look 0
after 0
you. 0

We’ll 0
house, 0
feed 0
and 0
clothe 0
you 0
and 0
look 0
after 0
your 0
retirement.’ 0
The 0
new 0
arrangement 0
is 0
a 0
perversion 0
of 0
that: 0
‘Keep 0
quiet 0
and 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
it 0
all 0
and 0
you’ll 0
be 0
fine, 0
but 0
step 0
an 0
inch 0
out 0
of 0
line 0
and 0
we’ll 1
destroy 1
you.’” 1

So 0
what 0
do 0
we 0
do? 0

The 0
Old 0
Paradigm 0
is 0
destroyed 0
and 0
going 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
is 0
a 0
guarantee 0
of 0
destruction 0
for 0
yourself 0
and 0
everyone 0
else. 0

As 0
we 0
saw 0
in 0
Ireland 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
Purge 0
has 0
started. 0

It’s 0
not 0
enough 0
to 0
simply 0
demand 0
that 0
a 0
priest 0
continue 0
in 0
his 0
ministry 0
no 0
matter 0
what. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
start 0
working 0
together 0
with 0
faithful 0
priests 0
– 0
while 0
there 0
still 0
are 0
some 0
– 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
create 0
practical 0
material 0
alternatives. 0

If 0
we 0
who 0
still 0
love 0
the 0
Church 0
want 0
priests 0
to 0
be 0
faithful, 0
and 0
even 0
to 0
start 0
denouncing 0
the 0
evil 0
and 0
corruption 0
they 0
see, 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
create 0
a 0
modicum 0
of 0
independence 0
and 0
security 0
in 0
which 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

The 0
other 0
day 0
the 0
American 0
conservative 0
writer, 0
John 0
Zmirak, 0
wrote 0
a 0
sound 0
suggestion 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
I 0
think 0
it’s 0
time 0
we 0
all 0
started 0
taking 0
seriously. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
continued 0
outrages 0
of 0
both 0
“good” 0
and 0
bad 0
bishops, 0
Zmirak 0
suggested 0
establishing 0
“an 0
escrow 0
fund 0
in 0
each 0
scandal-plagued 0
diocese, 0
where 0
laymen 0
[can] 0
deposit 0
the 0
funds 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
donated 0
to 0
[the] 0
local 0
church, 0
until 0
[a] 0
new 0
bishop 0
[is] 0
appointed.” 0

I 0
responded: 0
“And 0
the 0
money 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
purchase 0
properties 0
to 0
house 0
faithful 0
priests 0
punished 0
by 0
their 0
bishops 0
for 0
refusing 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm. 0

We 0
could 0
even 0
perhaps 0
buy 0
a 0
few 0
convents 0
so 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
could 0
continue 0
to 0
pray 0
in 0
peace, 0
without 0
harassment 0
from 0
the 0
evil 0
men 0
in 0
Rome.” 0

I 0
am 0
hearing 0
lately 0
from 0
laymen 0
who 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
setting 0
up 0
financial 0
structures 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
authentic 0
Catholic 0
life 0
can 0
be 0
maintained 0
through 0
what 0
is 0
obviously 0
soon 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
general 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
institution. 0

This 0
would 0
mean 0
independent 0
non-profit 0
foundations 0
that 0
could 0
build 0
or 0
buy 0
church 0
buildings, 0
convents 0
and 0
even 0
schools 0
and 0
provide 0
salaries 0
for 0
priests 0
and 0
other 0
staff. 0

I 0
started 0
thinking 0
about 0
this 0
recently 0
when 0
I 0
received 0
a 0
note 0
from 0
a 0
reader 0
with 0
a 0
link 0
to 0
an 0
online 0
petition 0
from 0
Germany, 0
addressed 0
to 0
the 0
German 0
bishops 0
[!!!] 0

“begging” 0
those 0
manifestly 1
evil 1
and 1
apostate 1
men 1
not 0
to 0
close 0
a 0
famous 0
and 0
ancient 0
monastic 0
house. 0

I 0
responded 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
going 0
about 0
things 0
the 0
wrong 0
way. 0

Catholics 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
get 0
their 0
heads 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
mindset 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
helpless 0
petitioners, 0
“begging” 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
to 0
maintain 0
the 0
Faith. 0

First 0
of 0
all, 0
it 0
only 0
gives 0
them 0
a 0
frisson 0
of 0
pleasure 0
to 0
see 0
us 0
groveling 0
and 0
begging 0
for 0
mercy. 0

Let’s 0
not 0
give 0
them 0
that, 0
OK? 0

There’s 0
already 0
enough 0
“frissons 0
of 0
pleasure” 0
in 0
their 0
lives. 0

Second, 0
it’s 0
simply 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
work. 0

In 0
Germany, 0
in 0
the 0
US, 0
in 0
Canada, 0
in 0
Italy, 0
in 0
Britain… 0
throughout 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
1st 0
world, 0
and 0
in 0
much 0
of 0
it 0
elsewhere, 0
the 0
men 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
“institutional 0
Church” 0
– 0
that 0
is, 0
whose 0
names 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
bank 0
accounts 0
– 0
are 0
dedicated 1
to 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
everything 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
preserve. 1

The 0
wolves 1
are 0
now 0
looking 0
with 0
ravening 0
eyes 0
at 0
the 0
faithful. 0

They 0
are, 0
in 0
short, 0
our 1
enemies. 1

They’ve 0
become 0
so 0
by 0
making 0
themselves 0
the 0
enemies 0
of 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Holy 0
Church. 0

They 0
know 0
it 0
and 0
it’s 0
time 0
we 0
stopped 0
imagining 0
otherwise. 0

The 0
other 0
suggestion 0
I 0
have 0
is 0
for 0
young 0
men 0
interested 0
in 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
fortify 0
themselves 0
not 0
only 0
spiritually 0
but 0
in 0
the 0
material 0
sphere. 0

There’s 0
one 0
big 0
vulnerability 0
we 0
can 0
guard 0
against 0
pretty 0
easily. 0

No 0
one 0
should 0
be 0
facing 0
penury 0
and 0
permanent 0
unemployment 0
because 0
he’s 0
a 0
faithful 0
Catholic. 0

We 0
should 0
never 0
be 0
letting 0
any 0
young 0
man 0
go 0
into 0
any 0
diocesan 0
seminary 0
without 0
being 0
a 0
property 0
owner. 0

He 0
should 0
own 0
a 0
house 0
or 0
stand 0
to 0
inherit 0
one. 0

Families 0
have 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
see 0
this 0
as 0
a 0
duty 0
to 0
the 0
child 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
Church. 0

And 0
more 0
than 0
that, 0
the 0
potential 0
priest 0
needs 0
to 0
have 0
job 0
skills 0
that 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

Among 0
the 0
working 0
classes 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
bias 0
against 0
intellectual 0
work. 0

But 0
most 0
working 0
class 0
people 0
have 0
a 0
pretty 0
sensible 0
attitude 0
towards 0
ambitions 0
in 0
academia: 0
get 0
something 0
under 0
your 0
belt 0
you 0
can 0
fall 0
back 0
on. 0

How 0
many 0
philosophy 0
PhDs 0
can 0
build 0
himself 0
a 0
bookshelf? 0

Change 0
the 0
oil 0
in 0
a 0
car? 0

Rewire 0
a 0
house? 0

The 0
standard 0
cliché 0
of 0
young 0
people 0
with 0
useless 0
academic 0
degrees 0
working 0
at 0
Starbucks 0
has 0
become 0
so 0
common 0
it’s 0
not 0
even 0
worth 0
memeing 0
anymore. 0

How 0
many 0
young 0
men 0
do 0
we 0
foresee 0
being 0
forced 0
out 0
of 0
seminary 0
for 0
having 0
the 0
wrong 0
“sexual 0
orientation”? 0

Every 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
guys 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
snap 0
his 0
fingers 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
rector 0
and 0
walk 0
straight 0
into 0
a 0
decent 0
job, 0
based 0
not 0
on 0
any 0
recommendation 0
from 0
a 0
corrupt 0
bishop, 0
but 0
on 0
his 0
solid 0
skills. 0

Among 0
the 0
white 0
collar 0
classes 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
bias 0
against 0
blue 0
collar 0
work, 0
but 0
the 0
trades 0
are 0
crying 0
out 0
for 0
skilled 0
men 0
and 0
a 0
trade 0
school 0
diploma 0
in 0
fixing 0
tractors 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
cheaper 0
and 0
a 0
lot 0
faster 0
to 0
get 0
than 0
a 0
university 0
degree. 0

That’s 0
an 0
economic 0
asset 0
that 0
we 0
can’t 0
afford 0
to 0
turn 0
up 0
our 0
well-educated 0
noses 0
at. 0

It 0

reminds 0

me 0
of 0
a 0
discussion 0
I 0
had 0
some 0
years 0
ago 0
with 0
the 0
prior 0
of 0
a 0
Benedictine 0
monastery 0
that 0
is 0
attracting 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
young 0
vocations. 0

One 0
kid 0
wanted 0
to 0
join 0
and 0
told 0
me 0
they 0
had 0
recommended 0
he 0
go 0
to 0
some 0
college 0
or 0
other 0
to 0
study 0
philosophy 0
first. 0

This 0
college, 0
apparently, 0
waives 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
tuition 0
and 0
gives 0
work 0
studies 0
to 0
people 0
going 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood 0
and 0
religious 0
life 0
so 0
they 0
can 0
avoid 0
the 0
student 0
loan 0
trap. 0

This 0
is 0
fine, 0
good 0
idea. 0

But 0
I 0
asked 0
him 0
what 0
he 0
knew 0
how 0
to 0
do. 0

“Can 0
you 0
fix 0
a 0
bathroom 0
pipe? 0

Do 0
you 0
know 0
anything 0
about 0
what 0
to 0
feed 0
a 0
sheep 0
or 0
how 0
to 0
care 0
for 0
a 0
cow? 0

Can 0
you 0
drive 0
a 0
tractor?” 0
This 0
nice 0
kid, 0
who 0
certainly 0
does 0
have 0
a 0
vocation, 0
could 0
read 0
books 0
and 0
look 0
things 0
up 0
on 0
the 0
internet 0
and 0
write 0
a 0
pretty 0
mean 0
paper 0
on 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas, 0
but 0
not 0
a 0
lot 0
else. 0

There 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
shift 0
in 0
attitude 0
in 0
our 0
remaining 0
faithful 0
institutions. 0

Does 0
a 0
monastery 0
really 0
need 0
all 0
of 0
its 0
members 0
to 0
have 0
PhDs 0
in 0
philosophy 0
and 0
theology? 0

Wouldn’t 0
it 0
also 0
be 0
useful 0
to 0
have 0
an 0
electrician, 0
a 0
plumber, 0
a 0
carpenter, 0
a 0
cook, 0
someone 0
who 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
fix 0
a 0
car 0
or 0
a 0
tractor? 0

Or 0
for 0
that 0
matter, 0
a 0
certified 0
accountant 0
or 0
an 0
investment 0
banker? 0

If 0
you 0
insist 0
on 0
having 0
people 0
with 0
degrees, 0
maybe 0
a 0
degree 0
in 0
agriculture 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
fit 0
for 0
a 0
big 0
monastic 0
foundation 0
with 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
land 0
like, 0
say, 0
Clear 0
Creek 0
or 0
that 0
new 0
Carmelite 0
place 0
in 0
Nebraska. 0

I 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
time 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
start 0
overcoming 0
our 0
class 0
snobbery. 0

Young 0
men 0
with 0
ambitions 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
tuck 0
away 0
employability 0
and 0
an 0
independent 0
financial 0
foundation, 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
way 0
people 0
used 0
to 0
tuck 0
money 0
away 0
against 0
a 0
rainy 0
day. 0

Simply 0
put, 0
they’ve 0
got 0
to 0
stop 0
being 0
materially 0
dependent 0
on 0
the 0
hierarchy. 0

This 0
vulnerability 0
is 0
a 0
gun 0
to 0
their 0
heads 0
in 0
this 0
time. 0

The 0
next 0
kid 0
who 0
says 0
anything 0
to 0
me 0
about 0
wanting 0
to 0
enter 0
the 0
diocesan 0
priesthood, 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
ask, 0
“How 0
sound 0
is 0
your 0
investment 0
portfolio?” 0
The 0
next 0
candidate 0
for 0
religious 0
life, 0
I’ll 0
ask, 0
“Great! 0

What’s 0
your 0
trade? 0

What 0
do 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
fall 0
back 0
on?” 0

I’m 0
given 0
to 0
understand 0
that 0
some 0
houses 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
of 0
the 0
Oratory 0
ask 0
candidates 0
to 0
come 0
with 0
an 0
independent 0
income, 0
which, 0
given 0
what 0
we’re 0
seeing 0
elsewhere 0
doesn’t 0
sound 0
like 0
a 0
bad 0
idea. 0

Perhaps 0
Catholic 0
financial 0
advisors 0
could 0
be 0
encouraged 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
a 0
programme 0
to 0
teach 0
young 0
men 0
how 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
sound 0
financial 0
footing 0
with 0
investments. 0

Meanwhile, 0
we 0
must 0
refocus 0
our 0
energy 0
on 0
the 0
Faith 0
itself, 0
instead 0
of 0
the 0
physical 0
and 0
even 0
canonical 0
structures 0
that 0
house 0
it. 0

That 0
monastery 0
in 0
Germany 0
is 0
lost. 0

Those 0
bishops 0
want 0
the 0
property 0
and 0
they’ll 0
get 0
it. 0

What 0
the 0
group 0
of 0
laymen 0
should 0
be 0
doing, 0
instead 0
of 0
petitioning 0
that 0
it 0
be 0
saved, 0
is 0
finding 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
the 0
nuns 0
can 0
live 0
their 0
charism 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
without 0
episcopal 0
harassment. 0

Bishops 0
won’t 0
protect 0
and 0
support 0
good 0
priests? 0

Then 1
it’s 1
up 1
to 1
us. 1

The 0
Vatican 0
wants 0
to 0
force 0
all 0
religious 0
congregations 0
into 0
the 0
pants-wearing, 0
Marxist 0
anti-nun, 0
LCWR 0
pattern? 0

We’re 0
not 0
helpless. 0

We 0
start 0
buying 0
convent 0
buildings 0
and 0
start 0
a 0
fund 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
nun-refugees. 0

Our 0
goal 0
must 0
be 0
preserving 0
the 0
precious 0
treasure, 0
the 0
Deposit 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
the 0
sacramental 0
life, 0
the 0
great 0
charisms 0
and 0
artifacts 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
life. 0

I 0
am 0
reminded 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
curators 0
of 0
the 0
Hermitage 0
Museum 0
in 0
St. 0
Petersburg 0
did 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
advancing 0
German 0
army. 0

They 0
took 0
down, 0
packed 0
up 0
and 0
hid 0
the 0
art 0
treasures, 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
greatest 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

Over 0
a 0
million 0
precious 0
works 0
of 0
art 0
were 0
sent 0
on 0
trains 0
to 0
be 0
hidden 0
in 0
the 0
Urals. 0

Two 0
trains 0
got 0
away 0
to 0
safety, 0
but 0
one 0
was 0
still 0
there 0
when 0
the 0
Germans 0
surrounded 0
the 0
city 0
and 0
began 0
the 0
siege. 0

The 0
museum’s 0
website 0
tells 0
us: 0

“Despite 0
starvation 0
and 0
severely 0
cold 0
temperatures, 0
the 0
Museum 0
continued 0
its 0
preservational 0
functions. 0

With 0
only 0
a 0
skeleton 0
staff 0
left 0
behind, 0
it 0
was 0
difficult 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
vast 0
buildings 0
and 0
their 0
sumptuous 0
interiors 0
against 0
snow, 0
wind 0
and 0
rain. 0

Equipped 0
with 0
first-aid 0
kits, 0
wearing 0
helmets 0
and 0
gloves, 0
the 0
Museum 0
air 0
wardens 0
cleared 0
away 0
heaps 0
of 0
broken 0
bricks 0
and 0
the 0
remains 0
of 0
charred 0
flooring 0
after 0
each 0
bomb 0
hit 0
the 0
building; 0
they 0
helped 0
dig 0
out 0
the 0
living 0
and 0
the 0
dead 0
and 0
bandage 0
the 0
wounded 0
after 0
raids 0
in 0
the 0
surrounding 0
area. 0

Twelve 0
air-raid 0
shelters 0
were 0
fitted 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
basements 0
of 0
the 0
Museum 0
complex 0
and 0
until 0
the 0
first 0
evacuations 0
were 0
made 0
in 0
March 0
1942 0
there 0
were 0
12,000 0
people 0
housed 0
there 0
permanently, 0
among 0
them 0
the 0
Museum 0
Director, 0
celebrated 0
Academician 0
Iosif 0
Orbeli.” 0
“Hermitage 0
staff 0
both 0
in 0
Sverdlovsk 0

give 0
tours 0
and 0
lectures, 0
describing 0
perfectly 0
the 0
artworks 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
removed. 0

They 0
understood 0
the 0
value 0
of 0
what 0
they 0
had, 0
and 0
did 0
everything 0
within 0
their 0
power 0
to 0
preserve 0
and 0
protect 0
it. 0

Does 0
this 0
all 0
sound 0
a 0
bit, 0
well, 0
schismatic? 0

Not 0
necessarily. 0

Any 0
bishop 0
who 0
can 0
demonstrate 0
through 0
his 0
actions 0
and 0
not 0
just 0
with 0
his 0
tweets, 0
who 0
can 0
prove 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
Catholic 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
wolf, 1
is 0
welcome 0
to 0
join 0
us. 0

But 0
we’d 0
be 0
fools 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
them. 0

Whatever 0
you 0
might 0
think 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre’s 0
solution 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
decades, 0
it 0
certainly 0
seems 0
inarguable 0
that 0
the 0
“state 0
of 0
emergency” 0
for 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
preparing 0
has 0
come 0
at 0
last. 0

And 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
emergency, 0
certain 0
norms 0
are 0
naturally 0
suspended. 0

The 0
simple 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
soon 0
there 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
“vagus” 0
priests 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
thrown 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
ministry 0
for 0
maintaining 0
the 0
Faith. 0

There 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
nuns 0
and 0
monks 0
without 0
homes, 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
England 0
of 0
Henry 0
VIII. 0

I 0
think 0
it’s 0
only 0
reasonable 0
that 0
those 0
who 0
also 0
want 0
to 0
maintain 0
the 0
Faith 0
should 0
reach 0
out 0
to 0
them 0
and 0
offer 0
what 0
shelter 0
we 0
can. 0

What 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
this 0
week 0
is 0
making 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
simply 0
no 0
longer 0
sit 0
back 0
and 0
“beg” 0
bishops 0
to 0
maintain 0
and 0
defend 0
the 0
Faith. 0

It’s 0
not 0
enough 0
now 0
to 0
go 0
into 0
seminary 0
or 0
a 0
monastery 0
with 0
glowing 0
eyes 0
and 0
a 0
firm 0
faith. 0

Sentiment 0
isn’t 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
much 0
comfort 0
when 0
the 0
young 0
man 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
so 0
very 0
young 0
and 0
finds 0
himself 0
standing 0
on 0
the 0
street 0
outside 0
the 0
chancery 0
with 0
no 0
skills, 0
no 0
money, 0
no 0
job, 0
(no 0
health 0
insurance) 0
and 0
no 0
prospects. 0

If 0
it 0
is 0
true 0
that 0
we 0
really 0
are 0
alone 0
in 0
this, 0
then 1
so 1
be 1
it. 1

Let’s 0
stop 0
lamenting 0
and 0
start 0
doing 0
practical 0
things 0
about 0
it. 0

___________________________________ 0

[1] 0
Dreher 0
and 0
others 0
are 0
asking 0
some 0
very 0
important 0
questions 0
now 0
about 0
the 0
activities 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
known 0
to 0
have 0
mentored, 0
one 0
of 0
whom 0
is 0
currently 0
making 0
interesting 0
headlines 0
as 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
Cardinal 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
Dicastery 0
for 0
Laity, 0
Family 0
and 0
Life, 0
and 0
as 0
the 0
primary 0
organiser 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Families 0
in 0
his 0
native 0
Dublin. 0

It 0
should 0
probably 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
time 0
he 0
left 0
over 0
a 0
“difference 0
of 0
opinion” 0
with 0
the 0
group’s 0
leadership, 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell 0
as 0
also 0
deeply 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ. 0

He 0
joined 0
in 0
1966, 0
was 0
ordained 0
in 0
’78, 0
and 0
was 0
quickly 0
appointed 0
to 0
a 0
high-ranking 0
position 0
as 0
general 0
director 0
with 0
responsibility 0
for 0
seminaries 0
and 0
schools 0
of 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ 0
in 0
Italy, 0
Spain 0
and 0
Ireland 0
until 0
1983. 0

This 0
period 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
peak 0
of 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
grotesquely 0
corrupt 0
Fr. 0

Maciel, 0
for 0
whom 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
shown 0
ALL 0
the 0
Legion’s 0
leadership 0
was 0
covering. 0

The 0
Farrell 0
family’s 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
Legion 0
continues 0
with 0
his 0
brother, 0
Bishop 0
Brian 0
Farrell, 0
who 0
ordained 0
20 0
new 0
priests 0
to 0
the 0
questionable-but-officially-reformed 0
community 0
in 0
2015. 0

A 0
recent 0
post 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
Regnum 0
Christi 0
website 0
shows 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
is 0
still 0
close 0
enough 0
to 0
the 0
Legion-related 0
“lay” 0
organisation 0
to 0
hire 0
dicastery 0
staff 0
from 0
their 0
ranks. 0

After 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
Legion, 0
Kevin 0
Farrell 0
joined 0
the 0
diocesan 0
clergy 0
in 0
Washington 0
DC 0
and 0
became 0
a 0
protégé 0
of 0
the 0
archbishop, 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl. 0

So 0
close 0
is 0
he 0
to 0
McCarrick 0
that 0
Farrell’s 0
coat 0
of 0
arms, 0
as 0
Elizabeth 0
Yore 0
reported 0
in 0
these 0
pages, 0
is 0
not 0
much 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
tribute 0
to 0
his 0
belatedly-disgraced 0
mentor. 0

So, 0
someone 0
in 0
a 0
journalistic 0
capacity 0
might 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
asking 0
a 0
few 0
questions 0
about 0
these 0
things 0
too. 0

[2] 0
It 0
should 0
also 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
in 0
his 0
book, 0
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope, 0
historian 0
Henry 0
Sire 0
documented 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
how 0
Jorge 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
always 0
operated, 0
collecting 0
bad 0
men 0
around 0
him 0
and 0
controlling 0
them 0
with 0
a 0
masterful 0
combination 0
of 0
threats 0
and 0
rewards. 0

The 0
natural 0
question, 0
“Why 0
does 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
keep 0
such 0
bad 0
men 0
around 0
him?” 0
is 0
now 0
easy 0
to 0
answer. 0
