ninth 0 42 10
Ebola 0 42 10

in 0 42 10
Congo 0 42 10
since 0 42 10
1976, 0 42 10
when 0 42 10
the 0 42 10
disease 0 42 10
was 0 42 10
first 0 42 10
identified. 0 42 10

Congo 0 42 11
has 0 42 11
a 0 42 11
long 0 42 11
track 0 42 11
record 0 42 11
with 0 42 11
Ebola, 0 42 11
the 0 42 11
World 0 42 11
Health 0 42 11
Organization 0 42 11
said. 0 42 11

The 0 42 12
most 0 42 12
recent 0 42 12
outbreak 0 42 12
was 0 42 12
in 0 42 12
May 0 42 12
2017 0 42 12
and 0 42 12
killed 0 42 12
four 0 42 12
of 0 42 12
the 0 42 12
eight 0 42 12
people 0 42 12
infected 0 42 12
in 0 42 12
Congo's 0 42 12
Bas-Uele 0 42 12
province 0 42 12
in 0 42 12
the 0 42 12
northeast. 0 42 12

That 0 42 13
outbreak 0 42 13
was 0 42 13
quickly 0 42 13
contained 0 42 13
and 0 42 13
was 0 42 13
declared 0 42 13
over 0 42 13
in 0 42 13
July. 0 42 13

None 0 42 14
of 0 42 14
these 0 42 14
outbreaks 0 42 14
was 0 42 14
connected 0 42 14

the 0 42 14
outbreak 0 42 14
in 0 42 14
Guinea, 0 42 14
Liberia 0 42 14
and 0 42 14
Sierra 0 42 14
Leone 0 42 14
that 0 42 14
began 0 42 14
in 0 42 14
2014 0 42 14

left 0 42 14
more 0 42 14

11,300 0 42 14
people 0 42 14
dead. 0 42 14

Ebola 0 42 15

animals, 0 42 15
including 0 42 15
bats 0 42 15
and 0 42 15
monkeys. 0 42 15

Without 0 42 16
preventive 0 42 16
measures, 0 42 16
the 0 42 16
virus 0 42 16
can 0 42 16
spread 0 42 16
quickly 0 42 16
between 0 42 16
people 0 42 16
and 0 42 16
is 0 42 16
fatal 0 42 16

up 0 42 16
to 0 42 16
90 0 42 16
percent 0 42 16
of 0 42 16
cases. 0 42 16

There 0 42 17
is 0 42 17
no 0 42 17
specific 0 42 17
treatment 0 42 17
for 0 42 17
Ebola, 0 42 17
which 0 42 17
is 0 42 17
spread 0 42 17
through 0 42 17
the 0 42 17
bodily 0 42 17
fluids 0 42 17
of 0 42 17

A 0 42 18
new 0 42 18
experimental 0 42 18
vaccine 0 42 18
has 0 42 18
been 0 42 18
shown 0 42 18
to 0 42 18
be 0 42 18
effective 0 42 18
against 0 42 18
the 0 42 18
virus, 0 42 18
though 0 42 18
quantities 0 42 18
