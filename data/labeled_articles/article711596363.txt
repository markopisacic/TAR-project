As 0
we 0
detailed 0
earlier, 0
in 0
a 0
verdict 0
that 0
has 0
shocked 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
Bay 0
Area 0
(and 0
across 0
America), 0
a 0
jury 0
of 0
six 0
men 0
and 0
six 0
women 0
in 0
sanctuary 0
city 0
San 0
Francisco 0
found 0
illegal 0
immigrant 0
(and 0
five-time 0
deportee) 0
Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
not 0
guilty 0
in 0
the 0
death 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle. 0

Mr. 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
been 0
homeless 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
and 0
had 0
multiple 0
felony 0
convictions 0
and 0
five 0
prior 0
deportations 0
to 0
Mexico. 0

He 0
had 0
been 0
set 0
free 0
from 0
jail 0
only 0
months 0
before 0
the 0
shooting, 0
in 0
defiance 0
of 0
requests 0
by 0
federal 0
immigration 0
authorities, 0
who 0
had 0
asked 0
that 0
he 0
be 0
held 0
longer 0
so 0
he 0
could 0
be 0
deported 0
again. 0

The 1
backlash 1
to 1
his 1
release 1
into 1
the 1
community 1
crescendoed 1
when 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
invoked 0
Ms. 0
Steinle’s 0
killing 0
as 0
he 0
campaigned 0
for 0
president. 0

As 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reports, 0
Ms. 0
Steinle’s 0
death 0
in 0
July 0
2015 0
fed 0
into 0
a 0
fierce 1
debate 1
over 0
whether 0
immigrants 0
without 0
legal 0
status 0
should 0
be 0
deported 0
more 0
aggressively, 0
and 0
over 0
the 0
role 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
should 0
play. 0

Ms. 0
Steinle, 0
known 0
as 0
Kate, 0
a 0
32-year-old 0
medical 0
equipment 0
saleswoman, 0
was 0
walking 0
along 0
Pier 0
14 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
struck 0
by 0
a 0
bullet 0
and 0
collapsed 0
into 0
her 0
father’s 0
arms. 0

Mr. 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
acknowledged 0
firing 0
the 0
weapon, 0
but 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
accident. 0

Zarate 0
and 0
his 0
defense 0
team 0
maintained 0
the 0
argument 0
that 0
the 0
suspect 0
found 0
the 0
stolen 0
weapon 0
on 0
the 0
pier 0
that 0
day 0
and 0
it 0
“just 1
fired.” 1
The 0
gun 0
belonged 0
to 0
a 0
federal 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Land 0
Management 0
ranger 0
and 0
was 0
stolen 0
from 0
his 0
parked 0
car 0
a 0
week 0
earlier. 0

The 0
bullet 0
ricocheted 0
on 0
the 0
pier’s 0
concrete 0
walkway 0
before 0
it 0
struck 0
Steinle, 0
killing 0
her. 0

Zarate 0
has 0
admitted 0
to 0
shooting 0
Steinle, 0
but 0
says 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
accident. 0

Defense 0
attorney 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
said 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
found 0
the 0
gun 0
at 0
the 0
pier… 0
but 0
the 0
stories 0
of 0
what 0
happened 0
copntradicted 0
one 0
another… 0

He 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
wrapped 0
in 0
cloth, 0
and 0
when 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
unwrapped 0
it, 0
the 0
gun 0
accidentally 0
discharged. 0

But 0
in 0
a 0
police 0
interrogation, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
admitted 0
to 0
firing 0
the 0
gun, 0
saying 0
he 0
was 0
aiming 0
at 0
a 0
seal. 0

He 0
also 0
told 0
police 0
that 0
he 0
stepped 0
on 0
the 0
gun, 0
causing 0
it 0
to 0
fire. 0

But 0
still, 0
after 0
six 0
days 0
of 0
deliberation, 0
the 0
illegal 0
Mexcian 0
immigrant 0
was 0
acquitted 0
of 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges 0
and 0
also 0
found 0
not 0
guilty 0
of 0
assault 0
with 0
a 0
firearm. 0

Garcia 0
Zarate 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
of 0
illegal 0
firearms 0
possession, 0
which 0
carries 0
a 0
sentence 0
of 0
16 0
months 0
to 0
three 0
years. 0

The 0
public 0
defender 0
wasted 0
no 0
time 0
in 0
focusing 0
his 0
thoughts 0
on 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
administration…saying 0
Zarate 0
was 0
“extremely 1
relieved” 1
by 0
the 0
outcome 0
and 0
that 0
while 0
Steinle’s 0
death 0
“was 0
a 1
horrible 1
tragedy,” 1
it 0
was 0
used 0
as 0
“political 1
fodder 1
for 0
then 0
candidate 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
anti-immigration 0
agenda.” 0

Adachi 0
added, 0
“Despite 0
the 0
unfairly 1
politicized 1
atmosphere 0
surrounding 0
this 0
case, 0
jurors 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
evidence, 0
which 0
was 0
clear 0
and 0
convincing, 0
and 0
rendered 0
a 0
just 0
verdict.” 0

In 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
verdict, 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
released 0
a 0
statement 0
saying 0
that 0
despite 0
California’s 0
attempt 0
at 0
a 0
murder 0
conviction, 0
Zarate 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
walk 0
away 0
with 0
only 0
a 0
firearm 0
possession 0
conviction 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
turned 0
over 0
by 0
San 0
Francisco 0
to 0
ICE. 0

“When 1
jurisdictions 1
choose 1
to 1
return 1
criminal 1
aliens 1
to 1
the 1
streets 1
rather 1
than 1
turning 1
them 1
over 1
to 1
federal 1
immigration 1
authorities, 1
they 1
put 1
the 1
public’s 1
safety 1
at 1
risk,” 1
the 0
statement 0
said. 0

“San 1
Francisco’s 1
decision 1
to 1
protect 1
criminal 1
aliens 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
preventable 1
and 1
heartbreaking 1
death 1
of 1
Kate 1
Steinle.” 1
Sessions 0
continued, 0
“I 0
urge 0
the 0
leaders 0
of 0
the 0
nation’s 0
communities 0
to 0
reflect 0
on 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
this 0
case 0
and 0
consider 0
carefully 0
the 0
harm 0
they 0
are 0
doing 0
to 0
their 0
citizens 0
by 0
refusing 0
to 0
cooperate 0
with 0
federal 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officers.” 0

Social 0
media 0
erupted 0
with 0
outrage 0
at 0
the 0
verdict 0
(with 0
very 0
few 0
– 0
if 0
any 0
attempting 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
verdict)… 0

I 0
don't 0
know 0
any 0
American 1
citizen 1
who 0
is 0
a 0
5x 0
felon 0
and 0
could 0
get 0
away 0

someone 0
with 0
