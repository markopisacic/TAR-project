After 0 68 46
court, 0 68 46
Hadeed 0 68 46
told 0 68 46
reporters 0 68 46
Bacon 0 68 46
had 0 68 46
threatened 0 68 46
to 0 68 46
sue 0 68 46
him 0 68 46
for 0 68 46
defamation. 0 68 46

“I 0 68 47

that,” 0 68 47

outside 0 68 47

“I 0 68 48

In 0 68 49
court, 0 68 49
Bacon 0 68 49
badgered 0 68 49
Hadeed. 0 68 49

“Are 0 68 50
you 0 68 50

not. 0 68 51

I 0 68 52
hope 0 68 52
you 0 68 52
learned 0 68 52
that 0 68 52
lesson,” 0 68 52
he 0 68 52
said. 0 68 52

“You 1 68 53
have 1 68 53
no 1 68 53

do 1 68 53
you? 1 68 53

You’re 0 68 54
like, 0 68 54
talking 1 68 54
to 1 68 54
a 1 68 54
wall,” 1 68 54
he 0 68 54
said 0 68 54
of 0 68 54
Gilani. 0 68 54

Hadeed 0 68 55
said 0 68 55
three 0 68 55
different 0 68 55
signatures 0 68 55
from 0 68 55
Abid 0 68 55
on 0 68 55
financial 0 68 55
documents 0 68 55
did 0 68 55
not 0 68 55
match, 0 68 55
and 0 68 55
put 0 68 55
a 0 68 55
defiant 0 68 55
Abid 0 68 55
on 0 68 55
the 0 68 55
witness 0 68 55
stand. 0 68 55

Hadeed: 0 68 56
Why 1 68 56
do 1 68 56
your 1 68 56
signatures 1 68 56
look 1 68 56
different? 1 68 56

Abid: 0 68 57
My 0 68 57
signatures 0 68 57
are 0 68 57
not 0 68 57
very 0 68 57
consistent, 0 68 57
I’m 1 68 57
just 1 68 57
a 1 68 57
human 1 68 57
being… 1 68 57

Hadeed: 0 68 58
You 0 68 58
were 0 68 58
aware 0 68 58
you 0 68 58
were 0 68 58
changing 0 68 58
beneficiary 0 68 58
from 0 68 58
your 0 68 58
father’s 0 68 58
spouse 0 68 58
to 0 68 58
yourself? 0 68 58

Abid: 0 68 59
That 0 68 59
was 0 68 59
my 0 68 59
father’s 0 68 59
request… 0 68 59

Hadeed: 0 68 60
You’re 0 68 60
not 0 68 60
answering 0 68 60
the 0 68 60
question. 0 68 60

Abid: 0 68 61
I’m 0 68 61
not 0 68 61
very 0 68 61
smart, 0 68 61
so 0 68 61
it 0 68 61
takes 0 68 61
a 0 68 61
while 0 68 61
sometimes… 0 68 61

Judge: 0 68 62
I 1 68 62
don’t 1 68 62
understand 1 68 62
why 1 68 62
the 1 68 62
witness 1 68 62
is 1 68 62
having 1 68 62
such 1 68 62
trouble 1 68 62
with 1 68 62
the 1 68 62
question. 1 68 62

Your 0 68 63
job 0 68 63
is 0 68 63
to 0 68 63
answer 0 68 63
the 0 68 63
question. 0 68 63

In 0 68 64
court 0 68 64
documents, 0 68 64
Gilani 0 68 64
alleged, 0 68 64
“while 0 68 64
he 0 68 64
was 0 68 64
admitted 0 68 64
in 0 68 64

my 0 68 64

some 0 68 64
other 0 68 64

also 0 68 64
installed/planted 0 68 64
in 0 68 64
my 0 68 64
house 0 68 64
… 0 68 64
Imran 0 68 64
Awan 0 68 64
showed 0 68 64
up 0 68 64
and 0 68 64
threatened 0 68 64
me 0 68 64
for 0 68 64
me 0 68 64
calling 0 68 64
the 0 68 64
police. 0 68 64

[Imran] 0 68 65
threatened 1 68 65
that 1 68 65
he 1 68 65
is 1 68 65

powerful 1 68 65
and 0 68 65
if 1 68 65
I 1 68 65
ever 1 68 65
call 1 68 65
the 1 68 65
police 1 68 65
again 1 68 65
[he] 1 68 65
will 1 68 65
do 1 68 65
harm 1 68 65
to 1 68 65
me.” 1 68 65
She 0 68 65
said 0 68 65
that 0 68 65
Imran 0 68 65
eventually 0 68 65
agreed 0 68 65
to 0 68 65
remove 0 68 65
the 0 68 65
listening 0 68 65
devices 0 68 65
and 0 68 65
did 0 68 65
so 0 68 65
in 0 68 65
front 0 68 65
of 0 68 65
her. 0 68 65

Based 0 68 66
on 0 68 66
Hadeed’s 0 68 66
narrow 0 68 66
legal 0 68 66
argument 0 68 66
about 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
life 0 68 66
insurance 0 68 66
contract’s 0 68 66
language, 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
judge 0 68 66
ruled 0 68 66
that, 0 68 66
“The 0 68 66
son 0 68 66
as 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
owner 0 68 66

the 0 68 66

the 0 68 66
absolute 0 68 66
right 0 68 66
to 0 68 66
change 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
beneficiary.” 0 68 66

After 0 68 67
Gilani 0 68 67
retained 0 68 67
a 0 68 67
lawyer, 0 68 67
Bacon 0 68 67
had 0 68 67
offered 0 68 67
a 0 68 67
settlement 0 68 67
where 0 68 67
they’d 0 68 67
split 0 68 67
the 0 68 67
money, 0 68 67
but 0 68 67
Gilani 0 68 67
declined 0 68 67
it. 0 68 67

The 0 68 68
court 0 68 68
awarded 0 68 68
Abid 0 68 68
the 0 68 68
$50,000 0 68 68
life 0 68 68
insurance 0 68 68
payout, 0 68 68
minus 0 68 68
$5,000 0 68 68
that 0 68 68
the 0 68 68
insurance 0 68 68
company 0 68 68
took 0 68 68
for 0 68 68
its 0 68 68
expenses 0 68 68
in 0 68 68
litigating 0 68 68
the 0 68 68
fraud 0 68 68
allegations. 0 68 68

“You 0 68 69
should 0 68 69
have 0 68 69
taken 0 68 69
the 0 68 69
settlement. 0 68 69

Now 0 68 70
she’s 0 68 70
not 0 68 70
getting 0 68 70
a 0 68 70
penny,” 0 68 70
Bacon 0 68 70
said 0 68 70
in 0 68 70
court. 0 68 70

“You’re 0 68 71
not 0 68 71
getting 0 68 71
anything.” 0 68 71

Gilani 0 68 72
said 0 68 72
after 0 68 72
court 0 68 72
that 0 68 72
her 0 68 72
conscience 0 68 72
didn’t 0 68 72
allow 0 68 72
her 0 68 72
to 0 68 72
settle. 0 68 72

“I 0 68 73
didn’t 0 68 73
do 0 68 73
the 0 68 73

because 0 68 73
they 0 68 73

I 0 68 74
cannot 0 68 74
agree 0 68 74
to 0 68 74
that. 0 68 74

It 0 68 75
