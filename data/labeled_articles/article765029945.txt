nothing 0

Nazi 1
Germany 1
in 0
an 0
ominous 0
Tweet. 0

“Other 0
governments 0
have 0
separated 0
mothers 0
and 0
children,” 0
Former 0
CIA 0
and 0

chief 0
Michael 0
Hayden 0
wrote 0
on 0

along 0

black 0

white 0
photo 0
of 0
the 0
Birkenau 0

Then 0
Hayden 0
doubled 0
down 0
on 0
that 0
analogy. 0

It's 0
particularly 1
stupid 1
of 0
Michael 0
Hayden 0
to 0
make 0
that 0
analogy 0
because 0
during 0
the 0
Bush 0

he 0
ran 0
were 0
compared 0

But 0
instead 0
it 0
seems 0

have 0
whetted 0
his 0

making 0
them. 0

Yes, 0
the 0
Nazi 1
arrested 0
people, 0
asked 0
them 0
for 0
ID, 0
split 0
up 0
families 0
and... 0
then 0

them 1
all. 1

That's 0
the 0
really 0

part. 0

Every 0
country 0

Just 0
about 0
every 0
country 0
splits 0
up 0
families 0
when 0
they 0
arrest 0
the 0
parents. 0

That's 0
not 0
unique. 0

Selecting 0
