Wait! 0
Wait! 0

It’s 0
all 0
a 0
MISTRANSLATION! 0

Thus, 0

it 0
took 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year-and-a-half 0
for 0
the 0
Factory 0
to 0
roll 0
out 0
the 1
old 1
reliable 1
“mistranslation” 1
defense 0
to 0
explain 0
away 0
the 0
infamous 0
paragraph 0
303 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetita 0
(AL), 0
which 0
reads 0
as 0
follows 0
in 0
the 0
official 0
English 0
translation 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website: 0

Yet 0
conscience 0
can 0
do 0
more 0
than 0
recognize 0
that 0
a 0
given 0
situation 0
does 0
not 0
correspond 0
objectively 0
to 0
the 0
overall 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel. 0

It 0
can 0
also 0
recognize 0
with 0
sincerity 0
and 0
honesty 0
what 0
for 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
generous 0
response 0
which 0
can 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
God, 0
and 0
come 0
to 0
see 0
with 0
a 0
certain 0
moral 0
security 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
what 0
God 0
himself 0
is 0
asking 0
amid 0
the 0
concrete 0
complexity 0
of 0
one’s 0
limits, 0
while 0
yet 0
not 0
fully 0
the 0
objective 0
ideal. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
the 0
conscience 0
can 0
“inform” 0
a 0
sinner 0
that 0
his 0
continued 0
sinning 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
acceptable 0
to 0
God 0
but 0
is 0
even 0
what 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
“for 0
now,” 0
given 0
one’s 0
particular 0
“limits.” 0
This 0
outrageous 0
proposition, 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
situation 0
ethics 0
that 0
strikes 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
foundation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
moral 0
teaching, 0
has 0
justly 0
provoked 0
a 0
storm 0
of 0
criticism 0
from 0
lay 0
and 0
clerical 0
defenders 0
of 0
the 0
authentic 0
Magisterium. 0

But 0

it’s 0
all 0
a 0
misunderstanding, 0
say 0
Dr. 0
Robert 0
Fastiggi, 0
professor 0
of 0
Systematic 0
Theology 0
at 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
Major 0

Dr. 0

S.T.D., 0

at 0

and 0
Seminary. 0

All 1
of 1
the 1
critics 1
of 1
AL 1
are 1
wrong—every 1
one 1
of 1
them!—because, 1
you 1
see, 1
the 1
original 1
Latin 1
text 1
does 1
not 1
say 1
what 1
the 1
English 1
text 1
does. 1

Dr. 0
Robert 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Dr. 0

Dawn 0
Goldstein 0

Here 0
we 0
go 0
again. 0

So 0
what 0
does 0
the 0
Latin 0
say? 0

Here 0
is 0
the 0
paragraph 0
in 0
the 0
official 0
Latin: 0

Haec 0
autem 0
conscientia 0
agnoscere 0
potest 0
non 0
modo 0
statum 0
quendam 0
ab 0
universali 0
Evangelii 0
mandato 0
obiective 0
dissidere; 0
etiam 0
sincere 0
honesteque 0
agnoscere 0
poteste 0
quod 0
sit 0
liberale 0
responsum 0
in 0
praesenti 0
Deo 0
reddendum 0
atque 0
eadem 0
conscientia 0
firma 0
quadam 0
morali 0
certitudine 0
intellegere 0
illam 0
esse 0
oblationem 0
quam 0
ipse 0
Deus 0
requirit 0
inter 0
rerum 0
impedientium 0
congeriem, 0
quamvis 0
perfectum 0
nondum 0
sit 0
obiectivum 0
exemplar. 0

Yes, 0
and 0
so 0
what? 0

Well, 0
according 0
to 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein, 0
while 0
the 0
English 0
translation 0
reads: 0
“what 0
for 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
generous 0
response 0
which 0
can 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
God,” 0
the 0
Latin 0
employs 0
the 0
word 0
oblationem, 0
which 0
means 0
offering. 0

So, 0
What 0
the 0
Pope 0
Really 0
Means® 0
is: 0
“what 0
for 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
generous 0
offering 0
which 0
can 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
God.” 0
So, 0
it’s 0
an 0
offering 0
to 0
God, 0
not 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
God. 0

Big 0
difference. 0

But 0

just 0
a 0
moment: 0
how 0
can 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior 0
ever 0
be 0
characterized 0
as 0
an 0
“offering” 0
to 0
God? 0

It 0
would 0
seem 0
the 0
Latin 0
version 0
has 0
graver 0
implications 0
than 0
the 0
English 0
because 0
it 0
suggests 0
that 0
falling 0
short 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
moral 0
law 0
requires 0
is 0
an 0
oblation 0
pleasing 0
to 0
God 0
if 0
one’s 0
“limits” 0
make 0
obedience 0
to 0
the 0
moral 0
law 0
difficult. 0

And 1
that 1
is 1
exactly 1
the 1
nonsense 1
Fastiggi 1
and 1
Goldstein 1
expect 1
us 1
to 1
swallow: 1
“Pope 0
Francis 0
is 0
not 0
talking 0
about 0
an 0
offering 0
of 0
an 0
objectively 0
sinful 0
action 0
but 0
a 0
gift 0
of 0
self 0
that 0
moves 0
toward 0
God 0
and 0
the 0
objective 0
moral 0
norm.” 0

So, 0

our 1
intrepid 1
presenters 1
of 0
What 0
the 0
Pope 0
Really 0
Means® 0
would 0
have 0
us 0
believe 0
that 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
one 0
can 0
do 0
according 0
“the 0
“concrete 0
complexity 0
of 0
one’s 0
limits,” 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
simply 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior 0
but 0
rather 0
a 0
gift 0
of 0
self 0
because 0
it 0
moves 0
toward 0
morally 0
licit 0
behavior. 0

Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
have 0
managed 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
problem 0
even 0
worse 0
in 0
their 0
attempt 0
to 0
explain 0
it 0
away. 0

What 0

about 0
the 0
English 0
locution 0
“while 0
yet 0
not 0
fully 0
the 0
objective 0
ideal,” 0
which 0
seems 0
to 0
reduce 0
the 0
negative 0
precepts 0
of 0
the 0
natural 0
law 0
to 0
mere 0
ideals? 0

Not 0
so, 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
contend. 0

Do 0
not 0
all 1
those 1
ignorant 1
critics 1
of 1
AL 1
know 0
that 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
employs 0
the 0
phrase 0
“obiectivum 0
exemplar,” 0
which, 0
translated 0
literally 0
into 0
English 0
is 0
“objective 0
exemplar.” 0
They 0
declare 0
triumphantly: 0
“The 0
Latin 0
term 0
exemplar 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
an 0
unattainable 0
ideal, 0
it 0
specifically 0
means 0
a 0
pattern 0
or 0
model 0
to 0
follow.” 0

Give. 0

Me. 0

A. 0

Break. 0

A 0

pattern 0
or 0
model 0
to 0
follow 0
is 0
an 0
ideal, 0
as 0
a 0
standard 0
Latin 0
dictionary 0
confirms 0
with 0
its 0
definition 0
of 0
exemplar: 0
“(1) 0
copy/reproduction, 0
(2) 0
model, 0
pattern, 0
example, 0
original, 0
ideal. 0

Likewise, 0
the 0
definition 0
of 0
the 0
English 0
word 0
“exemplar” 0
is 0
simply: 0
“an 0
ideal 0
model.” 0

Here 0

too 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldsetein 0
only 0
worsen 0
the 0
problem 0
they 0
try 0
to 0
explain 0
away. 0

For 0
if 0
moral 0
behavior 0
is 0
now 0
to 0
be 0
viewed 0
as 0
merely 0
“exemplary” 0
rather 0
than 0
divinely 0
mandated 0
by 0
the 0
natural 0
law 0
that 0
binds 0
all 0
men—including 0
Thou 0
Shalt 0
Not 0
Commit 0
Adultery—then 0
basic 0
morality 0
becomes 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
heroic 0
virtue. 0

Thus, 0
continence 0
cannot 0
realistically 0
be 0
expected, 0
at 0
least 0
“for 0
now” 0
(AL 0
303), 0
of 0
the 0
average 0
Joe 0
or 0
Jane 0
with 0
an 0
“ex” 0
who 0
has 0
“remarried” 0
and 0
is 0
now 0
mired 0
in 0
the 0
“concrete 0
complexity 0
one’s 0
limits.” 0

So, 0

as 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
would 0
have 0
it, 0
all 1
the 1
tumult 1
triggered 1
by 1
AL 1
is 1
just 1
a 1
misunderstanding 1
caused 1
by 1
uninformed 1
people 1
who 1
haven’t 1
consulted 1
the 1
Latin 1
text—including 0
those 1
ignorant 1
Vatican 1
translators. 1

According 0
to 0
their 0
proposed 0
“alternate 0
translation” 0
into 0
English, 0
What 0
the 0
Pope 0
Really 0
Means® 0
is 0
that 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior 0
one 0
feels 0
unable 0
to 0
correct 0
due 0
to 0
one’s 0
“limits” 0
is 0
“the 0
offering 0
that 0
God 0
himself 0
is 0
asking 0
amid 0
the 0
mass 0
of 0
impediments, 0
although 0
it 0
may 0
not 0
yet 0
be 0
the 0
perfect 0
objective 0
model.” 0
Which 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
official 0
English 0
translation 0
already 0
says 0
but 0
with 0
fewer 0
words. 0

It 0

seems 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
are 0
hoping 0
no 0
one 0
will 0
notice 0
that 0
their 0
linguistic 0
tinkering 0
produces 0
no 0
real 0
change 0
in 0
meaning 0
but 0
only 0
an 0
intensification 0
of 0
its 0
perniciousness. 0

Indeed, 0
their 0
“proposed 0
alternate 0
translation” 0
reduces 0
the 0
avoidance 0
of 0
adulterous 0
relations 0
in 0
“second 0
marriages” 0
to 0
the 0
“perfect 0
objective 0
model.” 0
Now, 0
how 0
could 0
anyone 0
but 0
a 0
Pharisee 0
expect 0
perfection 0
from 0
people 0
living 0
in 0
adultery? 0

Are 0
you 0
perfect? 0

Then 0
again, 0
the 0
Pharisees 0
are 0
precisely 0
the 0
ones 0
Our 0
Lord 0
condemned 0
for 0
accommodating 0
divorce 0
and 0
remarriage 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
natural 0
law. 0

But 1
such 1
embarrassing 1
truths 1
need 1
not 1
impede 1
the 1
Bergoglian 1
Mercy 1
Train 1
as 1
it 1
barrels 1
toward 1
a 1
train 1
wreck 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
line. 1

And 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
are 0
busily 0
helping 0
it 0
along, 0
changing 0
red 0
signals 0
to 0
green. 0

No 0
problem 0
here! 0

has 0
been 0
the 0
mantra 0
of 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
establishment 0
for 0
nearly 0
half 0
a 0
century 0
of 0
ecclesial 0
auto-demolition. 0

But 1

wait, 1
there’s 1
more! 1

Our 1
dynamic 1
translators 1
even 0
provide 0
their 0
own 0
dynamic 0
interpretation 0
of 0
AL 0
to 0
mean 0
that 0
the 0
“offering” 0
to 0
God 0
of 0
which 0
Francis 0
speaks 0
is 0
merely 0
the 0
decision 0
by 0
a 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
couple 0
with 0
children 0
not 0
to 0
end 0
their 0
relationship, 0
which 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
“perfect 0
objective 0
model,” 0
but 0
rather 0
to 0
“live 0
in 0
continence 0
until 0
they 0
may—after 0
the 0
hoped 0
for 0
declaration 0
of 0
nullity—enter 0
into 0
a 0
true 0
marriage.” 0
That 0
is, 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
Francis 0
affirming 0
John 0
Paul 0
II’s 0
Familiaris 0
consortio, 0
which 0
repeats 0
the 0
Church’s 0
constant 0
teaching 0
that 0
continence 0
is 0
required 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
entered 0
into 0
adulterous 0
“second 0
marriage,” 0
failing 0
which 0
they 0
cannot 0
be 0
admitted 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments. 0

But 0

the 0
Fastiggi-Goldstein 0
interpretation 0
is 0
precisely 0
the 0
contrary 0
of 0
the 0
interpretation 0
Francis 0
has 0
assiduously 0
promoted 0
and 0
which 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
just 0
as 0
assiduously 0
ignore: 0
i.e., 0
that 0
people 0
in 0
“second 0
marriages” 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
continence, 0
but 0
rather—in 0
“certain 0
cases”—may 0
continue 0
their 0
adulterous 0
relations 0
while 0
receiving 0
absolution 0
and 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
during 0
a 0
“process 0
of 0
discernment.” 0
As 0
we 0
know, 0
in 0
his 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
published 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website 0
(in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
query 0
he 0
himself 0
may 0
have 0
solicited), 0
Bergoglio 0
informed 0
them 0
“there 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
interpretation.” 0

Moreover, 0

the 0
Maltese 0
bishops' 0
“guidelines” 0
for 0
implementing 0
AL, 0
published 0
in 0
L’Osservatore 0
Romano—for 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
thanked 0
them—declare 0
thus: 0

If, 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
discernment, 0
undertaken 0
with 0
“humility, 0
discretion 0
and 0
love 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
her 0
teaching, 0
in 0
a 0
sincere 0
search 0
for 0
God’s 0
will 0
and 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
more 0
perfect 0
response 0
to 0
it” 0
(AL 0
300), 0
a 0
separated 0
or 0
divorced 0
person 0
who 0
is 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
new 0
relationship 0
manages, 0
with 0
an 0
informed 0
and 0
enlightened 0
conscience, 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
and 0
believe 0
that 0
he 0
or 0
she 0
are 0
at 0
peace 0
with 0
God, 0
he 0
or 0
she 0
cannot 0
be 0
precluded 0
from 0
participating 0
in 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
(see 0
AL, 0
notes 0
336 0
and 0
351). 0

This 0
Pope’s 0
plan 0
of 0
promulgating 0
a 0
deliberately 0
ambiguous 0
document 0
whose 0
heterodox 0
interpretation 0
and 0
application 0
he 0
would 0
later 0
approve 0
with 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
sub-magisterial 0
winks 0
and 0
nods, 0
both 0
oral 0
and 0
written, 0
is 0
the 0
reason 0
I 0
signed 0
onto 0
the 0
Correctio 0
Filialis. 0

See 0
the 0
piece 0
by 0
Joseph 0
Shaw 0
in 0
this 0
regard. 0

Shaw 0

maintains 0
that 0
AL 0
can 0
be 0
“bent 0
into 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
orthodoxy.” 0
Perhaps. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
our 0
responsibility 0
to 0
bend 0
a 0
Pope’s 0
statements 0
into 0
conformity 0
with 0
the 0
Faith. 0

Moreover, 0
any 0
Pope 0
who 0
promulgates 0
a 0
document 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
read 0
as 0
orthodox 0
only 0
by 0
a 0
forced 0
interpretation 0
imposed 0
by 0
certain 0
readers—while 0
others 0
disagree—has 0
by 0
that 0
very 0
fact 0
inflicted 0
grave 0
harm 0
upon 0
on 0
the 0
Church, 0
which 0
he 0
alone 0
has 0
the 0
duty 0
to 0
correct. 0

But 0
Francis, 0
as 0
any 0
reasonable 0
observer 0
can 0
see, 0
has 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
offering 0
any 0
such 0
correction. 0

Quite 0
to 0
the 0
contrary, 0
confusion 0
as 0
a 0
cover 0
for 0
the 0
introduction 0
of 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
for 1
“certain” 1
public 1
adulterers 1
by 0
Bergoglio’s 0
co-conspirators 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
and 0
various 0
dioceses 0
is 0
exactly 0
what 0
he 0
was 0
aiming 0
to 0
achieve 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
whole 0
synodal 1
charade, 1
which 0
was 0
merely 0
a 0
vehicle 0
for 0
promulgation 0
of 0
AL. 0

As 0
Shaw 0
observes 0
of 0
AL: 0
“What 0
we 0
[the 0
signers 0
of 0
the 0
Correctio] 0
are 0
saying 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
become 0
clear 0
that 0
orthodoxy 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
wants 0
us 0
to 0
find 0
there.” 0

In 1

a 1
sense, 1
what 1
Bergoglio 1
is 1
doing 1
is 1
worse 1
than 1
explicit 1
heresy, 1
which 0
could 0
at 0
least 0
be 0
readily 0
identified 0
and 0
denounced 0
as 0
such. 0

But 0
Bergoglio 0
wants 0
the 0
effects 0
of 0
heresy—undermining 0
Holy 0
Matrimony, 0
Confession 0
and 0
Holy 0
Communion, 0
whose 0
integrity 0
is 0
affirmed 0
verbally—without 0
the 0
guilt 0
of 0
an 0
explicit 0
promulgation. 0

In 0
so 0
acting, 0
he 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
in 0
the 0
mold 0
of 0
Honorius 0
I, 0
who 0
was 0
posthumously 0
anathematized 0
by 0
an 0
ecumenical 0
council 0
(the 0
Third 0
Council 0
of 0
Constantinople) 0
and 0
by 0
his 0
own 0
successor 0
(Leo 0
II) 0
for 0
aiding 0
and 0
abetting 0
the 0
spread 0
of 0
the 0
Monothelite 0
heresy 0
(no 0
human 0
but 0
only 0
a 0
divine 0
will 0
in 0
Christ). 0

Honorius 0
did 0
so 0
by 0
means 0
of 0
private 0
correspondence 0
with 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
heresy, 0
endorsing 0
the 0
heresy 0
without 0
ever 0
formally 0
proclaiming 0
it 0
as 0
doctrine. 0

And 0
yet 0
Honorius 0
I 0
is 0
listed 0
in 0
the 0
canon 0
of 0
the 0
Popes 0
and 0
is 0
not 0
considered 0
to 0
have 0
fallen 0
from 0
office 0
on 0
account 0
of 0
heresy. 0

A 0
similar 0
judgment 0
might 0
well 0
befall 0
this 0
Pope, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
for 0
us 0
to 0
level 0
it. 0

Meanwhile, 0

as 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
labor 0
to 0
convince 0
us 0
that 0
nothing 0
is 0
amiss 0
with 0
AL, 0
Pope 0
Bergoglio 0
is 0
sending 0
clear 0
signals 0
of 0
concern 0
about 0
the 0
rising 0
opposition 0
among 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
his 0
master 0
plan 0
to 0
subvert 0
the 0
Church 0
according 0
to 0
his 0
false 0
notion 0
of 0
mercy. 0

In 0
a 0
classic 0
power 0
move, 0
he 0
has 0
just 0
given 0
a 0
sop 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Burke, 0
the 0
perceived 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
opposition, 0
by 0
appointing 0
him 0
to 0
a 0
minor 0
position 0
on 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura—the 0
same 0
tribunal 0
from 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
brutally 0
removed 0
him 0
as 0
Prefect. 0

And 0
this 0
after 0
also 0
humiliating 0
Burke 0
as 0
the 0
spiritual 0
patron 0
of 0
the 0
Knights 0
of 0
Malta, 0
to 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
exiled 0
after 0
his 0
removal. 0

Will 0

this 0
sop 0
buy 0
Burke’s 0
silence, 0
staving 0
off 0
the 0
feared 0
public 0
correction? 0

We 0
will 0
soon 0
know 0
if 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
can 0
be 0
bought 0
so 0
easily. 0

But 0
this 0
move 0
demonstrates—if 0
more 0
evidence 0
were 0
needed—that 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
the 1
humble 1
apostle 1
of 1
mercy 1
depicted 1
in 1
his 1
carefully 1
crafted 1
public 1
relations 1
narrative, 1
but 1
rather 1
a 1
cunning 1
ecclesiastical 1
politician, 1
constantly 1
plotting 1
and 1
scheming 1
to 1
get 1
what 1
he 1
wants. 1

That 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
establishment 0
refuses 0
to 0
recognize 0
the 1
grim 1
reality 1
of 1
this 1
unprecedented 1
pontificate 1
is 0
but 0
another 0
page 0
in 0
the 0
long 0
annals 0
of 0
its 0
shameful 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
indefensible 0
to 0
the 0
detriment 0
of 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
Church. 0
