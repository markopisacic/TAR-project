An 0
experimental 0
Ebola 0
vaccine 0
is 0
being 0
rolled 0
out 0
in 0
Congo 0
as 0
the 1
death 1

from 1
the 1
infectious 1
disease 1
continues 1
to 1
climb. 1

The 0
vaccination 0
campaign 0
will 0
begin 0
today. 0

“The 0
vaccination 0
campaign 0
begins 0
tomorrow, 0
Monday, 0
in 0
Mbandaka, 0
capital 0
of 0
the 0
province,” 0
Minister 0
of 0
Health 0
Oly 0
Ilunga 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press 0
as 0
reported 0
by 0

Australia. 0

“It 0
will 0
target, 0
first, 0
the 0
health 0
staff, 0
the 0
contacts 0
of 0
the 0
sick 0
and 0
the 0
contacts 0
of 0
the 0
contacts.” 0
The 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
has 0
been 0
warning 0
about 0
the 0
“Ebola 0
situation” 0
in 0
Congo, 0
and 0
it 0
appears 0
their 0
only 1
solution 1
is 0
an 0
experimental 0
vaccine. 0

An 0
experimental 0
vaccine 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
tried 0
on 0
humans 0
before. 0

Ebola 0
hemorrhagic 0
fever, 0
seen 0
mostly 0
only 0
in 0
Africa, 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 0
feared 0
diseases. 0

It 0
begins 0
with 0
flu-like 0
symptoms, 0
followed 0
by 0
bloody 0
diarrhea 0
and 0
vomiting. 0

Days 0
later, 0
some 0
victims 0
begin 0
bleeding 0
through 0
the 0
nose, 0
mouth, 0
and 0
eyes. 0

Depending 0
on 0
the 0
strain 0
of 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus, 0
it 1
can 1
kill 1
up 1
to 1
90% 1
of 1
victims. 1

There 0
is 0
no 0
cure 0
for 0
Ebola. 0

The 0
virus 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
direct 0
contact 0
with 0
the 0
blood 0
or 0
secretions 0
of 0
an 0
infected 0
person. 0

So, 0
is 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus 0
reaching 0
a 0
terrifying 1
enough 0
level 0
that 0
an 0
experimental 0
vaccine 0
is 0
warranted? 0

The 0
death 0
toll 0
has 0
reached 0
26 0
and 0
the 0
vaccine 0
will 0
be 0
rolled 0
out 0
at 0
Mbandaka, 0
the 0
north-western 0
city 0
of 0
1.2 0
million 0
recently 0
struck 0
by 0
the 0
outbreak. 0

Since 0
the 0
virus 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
direct 0
contact, 0
an 0
isn’t 0
airborne, 0
it 0
isn’t 0
nearly 0
as 0
deadly 0
as 0
it 0
could 0
be. 0

Read 0
more 0
here 0
about 0
Ebola 0
and 0
how 0
it 0
is 0
transmitted: 0

Initially, 0
the 0
campaign 0
will 0
target 0
600 0
people, 0
mainly 0
medical 0
staff, 0
contacts 0
of 0
suspected 0
cases, 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
contact 0
with 0
the 0
contacts, 0
Ilunga 0
said. 0

Officials 0
are 0
working 0
urgently 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
disease 0
from 0
spreading 0
beyond 0
Mbandaka, 0
which 0
lies 0
on 0
the 0
Congo 0
River, 0
a 0
busy 0
traffic 0
corridor, 0
and 0
is 0
an 0
hour’s 0
flight 0
from 0
the 0
capital. 0

The 0
spread 0
of 0
Ebola 0
from 0
a 0
rural 0
area 0
to 0
Mbandaka 0
has 0
raised 0
alarm 1
as 1
Ebola 1
can 1
spread 1
more 1
quickly 1
in 1
urban 1
centers. 1

The 0
fever 0
can 0
cause 0
severe 0
internal 0
bleeding 0
that 0
is 0
often 0
fatal. 0

Meaning, 0
the 0
virus 0
itself 0
doesn’t 0
actually 0
kill. 0

The 0
immune 0
system’s 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
virus 0
is 0
what’s 0
deadly. 0

ZMapp 0
is 0
also 0
an 0
experimental 0
drug 0
that 0
could 0
aid 0
in 0
the 0
recovery 0
from 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus. 0

But, 0
like 0
the 0
vaccine 0
being 0
administered, 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
tested 0
for 0
safety 0
or 0
efficacy 0
yet. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
vaccine 0
– 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
therapeutic 0
drug. 0

Of 0
the 0
seven 0
people 0
given 0
the 0
drug 0
so 0
far, 0
two 0
have 0
died. 0

ZMapp 0
show 0
“promise,” 0
although 0
scientific 0
results 0
are 0
not 0
definitive. 0

The 0
risk 0
of 0
Ebola 0
spreading 0
within 0
Congo 0
is 0
“very 1
high,” 1
according 0
to 0
authorities, 0
and 0
the 1
disease 1
could 1
also 1
move 1
into 1
nine 1
neighboring 1
countries, 1
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
has 0
warned. 0

The 0
WHO, 0
however, 0
stopped 0
short 0
of 0
declaring 0
the 0
outbreak 0
a 0
global 0
health 0
emergency. 0

WHO 0
said 0
there 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
restrictions 0
on 0
international 0
travel 0
or 0
trade. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
it’s 0
important 0
to 0
prevent 0
oneself 0
from 0
contracting 0
the 0
virus. 0

Unfortunately, 0
health 0
care 0
workers 0
are 0
at 0
the 0
greatest 0
risk 0
as 0
they 0
try 0
to 0
cull 0
the 0
suffering: 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
experimental 0
vaccine. 0

For 0
their 0
sake, 0
let’s 0
hope 0
it 0
works 0
better 0
than 0
this 1
year’s 1
flu 1
vaccine. 1
