Secretary 0 15 1
of 0 15 1
State 0 15 1
Michael 0 15 1
R. 0 15 1
Pompeo 0 15 1
expressed 0 15 1
confidence 0 15 1
Wednesday 0 15 1
that 0 15 1
the 0 15 1
Saudi 0 15 1
government 0 15 1
could 0 15 1
be 0 15 1
trusted 0 15 1
to 0 15 1
investigate 0 15 1
the 0 15 1
disappearance 0 15 1
and 0 15 1
suspected 0 15 1
murder 0 15 1
of 0 15 1
a 0 15 1
U.S.-based 0 15 1
Saudi 0 15 1
journalist 0 15 1
in 0 15 1
a 0 15 1
Saudi 0 15 1
diplomatic 0 15 1
facility 0 15 1
in 0 15 1
Turkey 0 15 1
— 0 15 1
despite 0 15 1
the 0 15 1
likelihood 0 15 1
that 0 15 1
senior 0 15 1
Saudi 0 15 1
officials 0 15 1
were 0 15 1
involved. 0 15 1

Speaking 0 15 2
in 0 15 2
Ankara, 0 15 2
Turkey, 0 15 2
Pompeo 0 15 2
offered 0 15 2
that 0 15 2
support 0 15 2
hours 0 15 2
after 0 15 2
President 0 15 2
Donald 0 15 2
Trump 0 15 2
had 0 15 2
mounted 0 15 2
an 0 15 2
even 0 15 2
stronger 0 15 2
defense 0 15 2
for 0 15 2
the 0 15 2
Saudi 0 15 2
rulers, 0 15 2
saying, 0 15 2
“Here 0 15 2
we 0 15 2
go 0 15 2
again 0 15 2
with 0 15 2
you’re 0 15 2
guilty 0 15 2
until 0 15 2
proven 0 15 2
innocent.” 0 15 2

Together 0 15 3
they 0 15 3
appeared 0 15 3
to 0 15 3
signal 0 15 3
a 0 15 3
shift 0 15 3
in 0 15 3
White 0 15 3
House 0 15 3
strategy 0 15 3
— 0 15 3
earlier 0 15 3
this 0 15 3
week 0 15 3
Trump 0 15 3
had 0 15 3
warned 0 15 3
Saudi 0 15 3
rulers 0 15 3
could 0 15 3
face 0 15 3
“severe 1 15 3
punishment” 0 15 3
— 0 15 3
and 0 15 3
suggested 0 15 3
the 0 15 3
administration 0 15 3
has 0 15 3
decided 0 15 3
to 0 15 3
help 0 15 3
its 0 15 3
most 0 15 3
important 0 15 3
ally 0 15 3
in 0 15 3
the 0 15 3

The 0 15 4

lived 0 15 4
in 0 15 4
Virginia, 0 15 4

the 0 15 4
Saudi 0 15 4
Consulate 0 15 4
in 0 15 4

Neither 0 15 5
Trump 0 15 5
nor 0 15 5
his 0 15 5
top 0 15 5

offered 0 15 5
any 0 15 5

facts 0 15 5

in 0 15 5

But 0 15 6
unless 0 15 6
authorities 0 15 6
recover 0 15 6
his 0 15 6
body 0 15 6
or 0 15 6
other 0 15 6
conclusive 0 15 6
evidence 0 15 6
of 0 15 6
his 0 15 6
death, 0 15 6
the 0 15 6
mystery 0 15 6
may 0 15 6
remain 0 15 6
unsolved. 0 15 6

Pompeo 0 15 7
wrapped 0 15 7
up 0 15 7
two 0 15 7

of 0 15 7

Turkish 0 15 8

but 0 15 8
have 0 15 8
not 0 15 8

Turkish 0 15 9
officials 0 15 9
say 0 15 9
Khashoggi’s 0 15 9

was 1 15 9

up 1 15 9
with 1 15 9

on 0 15 10
Tuesday. 0 15 10

Erdogan 0 15 11
later 0 15 11
complained 0 15 11
that 0 15 11
the 0 15 11
interior 0 15 11
walls 0 15 11
had 0 15 11
been 0 15 11
repainted 0 15 11
in 0 15 11
recent 0 15 11
days. 0 15 11

On 0 15 12
his 0 15 12
flight 0 15 12
from 0 15 12
Riyadh 0 15 12
to 0 15 12
Ankara, 0 15 12
Pompeo 1 15 12
reiterated 1 15 12
his 1 15 12
confidence 1 15 12
that 1 15 12
the 1 15 12
Saudi 1 15 12
government 1 15 12
would 1 15 12
conduct 1 15 12
a 1 15 12
“thorough, 1 15 12
complete, 1 15 12
and 1 15 12
transparent 1 15 12
investigation,” 1 15 12
adding 1 15 12
that 1 15 12
they 1 15 12
will 1 15 12
“show 1 15 12
the 1 15 12
entire 1 15 12
world” 1 15 12
the 1 15 12
results. 1 15 12

He 0 15 13
said 0 15 13
Saudi 0 15 13
leaders 0 15 13
made 0 15 13
a 0 15 13
commitment 0 15 13
“to 0 15 13
hold 0 15 13
anyone 0 15 13
connected 0 15 13
to 0 15 13
any 0 15 13
wrongdoing 0 15 13
that 0 15 13
may 0 15 13
be 0 15 13
found 0 15 13
accountable 0 15 13
for 0 15 13
that, 0 15 13
whether 0 15 13
they 0 15 13
are 0 15 13
a 0 15 13
senior 0 15 13
officer 0 15 13
or 0 15 13
official.” 0 15 13
He 0 15 13
said 0 15 13
they 0 15 13
made 0 15 13
“no 0 15 13
exceptions,” 0 15 13
including 0 15 13
presumably 0 15 13
members 0 15 13
of 0 15 13
the 0 15 13
royal 0 15 13
family. 0 15 13

Asked 0 15 14
if 0 15 14
the 0 15 14
Saudis 0 15 14
had 0 15 14
informed 0 15 14
him 0 15 14
whether 0 15 14
Khashoggi 0 15 14
was 0 15 14
alive 0 15 14
or 0 15 14
dead, 0 15 14
Pompeo 0 15 14
said, 0 15 14
“I 0 15 14
don’t 0 15 14
want 0 15 14
to 0 15 14
talk 0 15 14
about 0 15 14
any 0 15 14
of 0 15 14
the 0 15 14
facts. 0 15 14

They 0 15 15
didn’t 0 15 15
want 0 15 15
to 0 15 15
either, 0 15 15
in 0 15 15
that 0 15 15
they 0 15 15
want 0 15 15
to 0 15 15
have 0 15 15
the 0 15 15
opportunity 0 15 15
to 0 15 15
complete 0 15 15
this 0 15 15
investigation 0 15 15
in 0 15 15
a 0 15 15
thorough 0 15 15
way.” 0 15 15

Asked 0 15 16
if 0 15 16
he 0 15 16
believed 0 15 16
the 0 15 16
Saudi 0 15 16
rulers’ 0 15 16
repeated 0 15 16
denial 0 15 16
of 0 15 16
complicity, 0 15 16
Pompeo 0 15 16
said 0 15 16
he 0 15 16
was 0 15 16
reserving 0 15 16
judgment. 0 15 16

“I 0 15 17
think 0 15 17
that’s 0 15 17
— 0 15 17
I 0 15 17
think 0 15 17
that’s 0 15 17
— 0 15 17
I 0 15 17
think 0 15 17
that’s 0 15 17
a 0 15 17
reasonable 0 15 17
thing 0 15 17
to 0 15 17
do, 0 15 17
to 0 15 17
give 0 15 17
them 0 15 17
that 0 15 17
opportunity,” 0 15 17
Pompeo 0 15 17
said, 0 15 17
“(and 0 15 17
then) 0 15 17
we’ll 0 15 17
all 0 15 17
get 0 15 17
to 0 15 17
evaluate 0 15 17
the 0 15 17
work 0 15 17
that 0 15 17
they 0 15 17
do.” 0 15 17

Pompeo 0 15 18
refused 0 15 18
to 0 15 18
discuss 0 15 18
possible 0 15 18
consequences 0 15 18
for 0 15 18
those 0 15 18
found 0 15 18
responsible 0 15 18
for 0 15 18
Khashoggi’s 0 15 18
disappearance, 0 15 18
reiterating 0 15 18
at 0 15 18
least 0 15 18
three 0 15 18
times 0 15 18
the 0 15 18
“importance 0 15 18
of 0 15 18
the 0 15 18
investigation.” 0 15 18

Later 0 15 19
Wednesday, 0 15 19
Pompeo 0 15 19
said 0 15 19
during 0 15 19
a 0 15 19
refueling 0 15 19
stopover 0 15 19
in 0 15 19
Brussels 0 15 19
that 0 15 19
Erdogan 0 15 19
had 0 15 19
informed 0 15 19
him 0 15 19
the 0 15 19
Saudis 0 15 19
were 0 15 19
cooperating 0 15 19
with 0 15 19
the 0 15 19
Turkish 0 15 19
investigation 0 15 19
“after 0 15 19
a 0 15 19
couple 0 15 19
of 0 15 19
delays.” 0 15 19

Turkish 0 15 20
officials 0 15 20
“seemed 0 15 20
pretty 0 15 20
confident 0 15 20

to 0 15 20
complete” 0 15 20
the 0 15 20
investigation, 0 15 20
Pompeo 0 15 20
told 0 15 20

Arabia 0 15 21
get 0 15 21
out 0 15 21
of 0 15 21
its 0 15 21
dilemma, 0 15 21
Pompeo 0 15 21
urged 0 15 21
Americans 0 15 21
to 0 15 21
be 0 15 21
mindful 0 15 21
of 0 15 21
the 0 15 21
extensive 0 15 21

including 0 15 21
efforts 0 15 21
against 0 15 21
what 0 15 21
he 0 15 21
called 0 15 21

of 0 15 21

“The 0 15 22
Saudis 0 15 22

on 0 15 22
these 0 15 22

Pompeo 0 15 22

“We 0 15 23

we 0 15 23
approach 0 15 23

on 0 15 23
whether 0 15 23

Congress 0 15 23
and 0 15 23
elsewhere 0 15 23

Critics 0 15 24

whether 0 15 24
the 0 15 24
Saudi 0 15 24
rulers, 0 15 24

— 0 15 24
especially 0 15 24
without 0 15 24
decisive 0 15 24

the 0 15 24

Saudi 0 15 25
leaders 0 15 25
for 0 15 25
two 0 15 25

On 0 15 26
Monday, 0 15 26
they 0 15 26
began 0 15 26
floating 0 15 26
a 0 15 26
scenario 0 15 26
— 0 15 26
initially 0 15 26
adopted 0 15 26
by 0 15 26
