the 0 422 24
accusation 0 422 24
claiming 0 422 24

Watching 0 422 25

it 0 422 25
is 0 422 25
obvious 0 422 25
that 0 422 25
President 0 422 25

was 0 422 25
making 0 422 25
a 0 422 25
sincere 1 422 25
effort 0 422 25
to 0 422 25
answer 0 422 25
Acosta’s 0 422 25

the 0 422 25

the 0 422 25

answer 0 422 25
three 0 422 25
of 0 422 25

before 0 422 25

losing 0 422 25
his 0 422 25
patients 0 422 25
when 0 422 25

to 0 422 25
hand 0 422 25
the 0 422 25

over. 0 422 25

Not 0 422 26
only 0 422 26
that, 0 422 26
he 0 422 26
used 0 422 26
his 0 422 26
