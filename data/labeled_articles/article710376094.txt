The 0 98 9
main 0 98 9
difference 0 98 9
between 0 98 9
asteroids 0 98 9
and 0 98 9
comets 0 98 9
is 0 98 9
their 0 98 9
composition. 0 98 9

Asteroids 0 98 10
are 0 98 10
made 0 98 10
up 0 98 10
of 0 98 10
metals 0 98 10
and 0 98 10
rocky 0 98 10
material, 0 98 10
while 0 98 10
comets 0 98 10
are 0 98 10
made 0 98 10
up 0 98 10
of 0 98 10
ice, 0 98 10
dust 0 98 10
and 0 98 10
rocky 0 98 10
material. 0 98 10

Comets 0 98 11
which 0 98 11
approach 0 98 11
the 0 98 11
Sun 0 98 11
lose 0 98 11
material 0 98 11
with 0 98 11
each 0 98 11
orbit 0 98 11
because 0 98 11
some 0 98 11
of 0 98 11
their 0 98 11
ice 0 98 11
melts 0 98 11
and 0 98 11
vaporizes 0 98 11
to 0 98 11
form 0 98 11
a 0 98 11
tail. 0 98 11

But 0 98 12
the 0 98 12
real 0 98 12
question 0 98 12
is 0 98 12
will 0 98 12
anyone 0 98 12
be 0 98 12
able 0 98 12
to 0 98 12

the 0 98 12
asteroid’s 0 98 12

approach 0 98 12
to 0 98 12
our 0 98 12
planet. 0 98 12

According 0 98 13
to 0 98 13
NASA, 0 98 13
3200 0 98 13
Phaethon 0 98 13
will 0 98 13
be 0 98 13
visible 0 98 13
in 0 98 13
small 0 98 13

for 0 98 13
experienced 0 98 13
observers 0 98 13
in 0 98 13
areas 0 98 13
with 0 98 13
dark 0 98 13
skies. 0 98 13

It 0 98 14
is 0 98 14
potentially 0 98 14
detectable 0 98 14
for 0 98 14
three 0 98 14
weeks 0 98 14
but 0 98 14
will 0 98 14
be 0 98 14
at 0 98 14
its 0 98 14
brightest 0 98 14
between 0 98 14
