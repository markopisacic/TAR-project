The 0

from 0
each 0
region 0
showed 0
that 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
provisions 0
found 0
in 0
Cor 0
orans 0
were 0
already 0
in 0
place: 0
federations 0
with 0
broad 0
powers, 0
including 0
financial 0
control 0
and 0
combined 0
formation 0
courses, 0
“religious 0

priests 0
appointed 0

and 0
overseeing 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
and 0

giving 0
up 0
their 0
authority 0
to 0
the 0

Given 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
2009, 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
plans 0
to 0
force 0
all 0
contemplative 0
monasteries 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
into 0
this 0
disastrous 1
European 0
mould 0
were 0
well 0
under 0
way 0
long 0
before 0

was 0
even 0
considering 0
resigning. 0

Today 0
I’ve 0
received 0
an 0
interesting 0
document 0
issued 0
by 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
in 0
Europe 0
following 0
a 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
“Federations 0
of 0
Discalced 0
Carmelite 0
Nuns 0
of 0
Europe 0
& 0
the 0
Holy 0
Land” 0
in 0
Avila, 0
February 0
2009. 0

As 0
a 0
snapshot 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
condition 0
of 0
Carmelite 0
monastic 0
life 0
after 0
it 0
had 0
been 0
completely 0
“federated,” 0
it 0
paints 0
a 0
depressing 1
picture; 0
but 0
as 0
a 0
demonstration 0
of 0
what 0
“federations” 0
are 0
likely 0
to 0
achieve 0
once 0
Cor 0
orans 0
is 0
implemented 0
universally, 0
it 0
clangs 0
in 0
the 0
mind 0
like 1
a 1
funeral 1
bell. 1

Reconciled 0
to 0
managed 0
extinction 0

The 0
report 0
shows 0
average 0
ages 0
of 0
nuns 0
between 0
65 0
and 0
80, 0
“infirmary 0
Carmels,” 0
nuns 0
in 0
state 0
nursing 0
homes, 0
entire 0
communities 0
living 0
in 0
care 0
facilities 0
and 0
half 0
the 0
Carmels 0
with 0
no 0
one 0
in 0
formation. 0

Solutions 0
offered 0
are 0
equally 0
uniform: 0
heaped-up 0
bureaucracy, 0
common 0
formation 0
courses 0
between 0
monasteries 0
developed 0
by 0
“religious 0
psychologists,” 0
ever 0
more 0
powers 0
handed 0
to 0
federations. 0

This 0
is 0
federated 0
Carmelite 0
monastic 0
life 0
under 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
of 0
fully 0
implemented 0
VaticanTwoism. 0

Very 0
little 0
is 0
said 0
of 0
any 0
efforts 0
being 0
made 0
to 0
increase 0
vocational 0
outreach 0
using 0
the 0
internet 0
or 0
through 0
diocesan 0
contacts. 0

And 0
perhaps 0
most 0
telling 0
of 0
all, 0
not 0
one 0
word 0
is 0
offered 0
of 0
applying 0
any 0
systematic 0
religious 0
solutions; 0
no 0
one 0
is 0
suggesting 0
increased 0
prayer 0
or 0
fasting, 0
Rosary 0
campaigns 0
or 0
novenas 0
in 0
what 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order’s 0
most 1
desperate 1
hour. 0

Nothing 0
is 0
said 0
of 0
increased 0
intensity 0
of 0
devotion 0
to 0
the 0
charism, 0
study 0
of 0
the 0
foundress 0
or 0
returning 0
to 0
sources, 0
still 1
less 1
of 0
strengthening 0
the 0
Carmelites’ 0
traditional 0
independent 0
self-governance 0
or 0
reconsidering 0
the 0
wisdom 0
of 0
“the 0
path 0
taken”. 0

Indeed, 0
in 0
one 0
case 0
in 0
Spain, 0
the 0
sisters 0
themselves 0
advocate 0
abandoning 0
traditional 0
Teresian 0
autonomy 0
altogether. 0

The 0
report 0
from 0
Great 0
Britain 0
notes: 0
“18 0
Carmels 0
have 0
closed 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
40 0
years. 0

There 0
have 0
been 0
two 0
amalgamations 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
and 0
another 0
one 0
involving 0
three 0
Carmels 0
is 0
in 0
process. 0

Two 0
communities 0
at 0
present 0
are 0
living 0
together 0
in 0
one 0
monastery 0
as 0
a 0
temporary 0
measure.” 0

The 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
is 0
downright 1
bizarre; 1
sisters 0
so 0
old 0
that 0
even 0
the 0
federation 0
structures 0
are 0
breaking 0
down. 0

Only 0
one 0
fully 0
autonomous 0
functioning 0
Carmel 0
still 0
exists 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands, 0
and 0
the 0
remains 0
of 0
four 0
entire 0
communities 0
are 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
single 0
care 0
home 0
run 0
by 0
religious 0
brothers. 0

But 0
in 0
this 0
situation, 0
the 0
“solution” 0
undertaken 0
has 0
been 0
an 0
elaborate 0
bureaucratic 0
reshuffle, 0
including 0
gaining 0
approval 0
from 0
Rome, 0
for 0
“a 0
completely 0
new 0
structure,” 0
whose 0
main 0
task, 0
no 0
doubt, 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
making 0
of 0
funeral 0
arrangements 0
and 0
disposing 0
of 0
library 0
books. 0

The 0
atmosphere 0
is 0
weirdly 0
resigned 0
– 0
one 0
federation 0
report 0
recommended 0
simply 0
“forgetting 0
the 0
numbers” 0
– 0
with 0
many 0
notes 0
of 0
mutual 0
congratulation 0
over 0
“unity,” 0
the 0
creating 0
of 0
“links” 0
and 0
the 0
“building 0
of 0
trust” 0
and 0
“dialogue” 0
between 0
communities. 0

The 0
report 0
from 0
Belgium 0
– 0
federated 0
in 0
1997, 0
average 0
age 0
73 0
with 0
one 0
sister 0
in 0
formation 0
for 0
11 0
monasteries 0
– 0
states 0
tersely 0
that 0
their 0
biggest 0
problem 0
is 0
“ageing” 0
but 0
under 0
“possible 0
solutions” 0
says 0
only, 0
“We 0
want 0
to 0
continue 0
along 0
the 0
path 0
we 0
have 0
begun.” 0

It 0
is 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
report 0
from 0
Croatia 0
where 0
the 0
problem 0
changes 0
abruptly 0
from 0
aging 0
nuns 0
and 0
no 0
vocations 0
to 0
too 0
many 0
vocations 0
with 0
not 0
enough 0
room[2]. 0

It 0
is 0
also 0
notable 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
Croatian 0
report 0
that 0
Christ 0
gets 0
a 0
direct 0
mention. 0

Federation 0
of 0
Croatia 0
& 0
Bosnia-Herzegovina: 0
82 0
nuns 0
in 0
5 0
convents, 0
with 0
an 0
average 0
age 0
of 0
47, 0
and 0
eleven 0
in 0
formation. 0

This 0
outlier 0
differs 0
from 0
the 0
Western 0
European 0
federations 0
in 0
several 0
respects, 0
notably 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
only 0
federated 0
in 0
2002. 0

But 0
the 0
effects 0
of 0
the 0
federating/formation 0
courses 0
are 0
already 0
being 0
felt: 0
“Nowadays, 0
two 0
monasteries 0
have 0
difficulty 0
because 0
of 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
vocations.” 0

Path 0
taken: 0
Have 0
made 0
a 0
foundation 0
in 0
Albania; 0
however 0
this 0
community 0
is 0
not 0
federated. 0

From 0
the 0
beginning, 0
our 0
Association 0
has 0
organized 0
formation 0
courses 0
for 0
the 0
younger 0
sisters 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
courses 0
of 0
permanent 0
formation. 0

Each 0
year, 0
we 0
have 0
one 0
or 0
two 0
seminars, 0
which 0
are 0
also 0
the 0
occasion 0
to 0
the 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Association. 0

The 0
duration 0
is 0
3 0
to 0
4 0
days 0
and 0
they 0
take 0
place 0
every 0
time 0
in 0
a 0
different 0
Monastery 0
of 0
the 0
Association. 0

We 0
invite 0
the 0
sisters 0
of 0
other 0
Carmelite 0
convents 0
friends 0
to 0
our 0
formation 0
courses: 0
sisters 0
from 0
Albania, 0
Slovenia 0
and 0
Bulgaria. 0

Present 0
Problems: 0
In 0
general, 0
in 0
our 0
Association 0
the 0
vocations 0
continue 0
growing, 0
but 0
there 0
are 0
differences 0
between 0
the 0
monasteries. 0

Nowadays, 0
two 0
monasteries 0
have 0
difficulty 0
because 0
of 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
vocations. 0

Possible 0
solutions: 0
We 0
do 0
all 0
what 0
is 0
in 0
our 0
hands 0
in 0
the 0
area 0
of 0
the 0
vocational 0
promotion, 0
collaborating 0
in 0
this 0
way 0
with 0
Christ 0
who 0
calls 0
by 0

Spirit. 0

These 0

in 0

to 0
a 0

out 0
for 0

with 0

reality 0

The 0
challenge 0

are 0
big 0
differences 0
between 0
the 0
various 0
convents. 0

The 0
number 0
of 0
vocations 0
has 0
diminished 0
quickly 0
and 0
the 0
numbers 0
increased 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
left 0
during 0
formation 0
and 0
during 0
the 0
first 0
years 0
of 0
solemn 0
profession. 0

Nonetheless 0
there 0
have 0
not 0
been 0
amalgamations 0
or 0
suppressions. 0

In 0
some 0
convents 0
old 0
age 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
concern. 0

Possible 0
Solutions: 0
They 0
are 0
working 0
on 0
formation 0
through 0
courses. 0

Also 0
on 0
communion 0
between 0
the 0
communities. 0

There 0
are 0
meetings 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
with 0
the 0
communities. 0

We 0
are 0
ready 0
to 0
accept 0
sisters 0
who 0
cannot 0
be 0
cared 0
for 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
communities. 0

However, 0
this 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
accepted 0
because 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
separated. 0

The 0
strangest 0
report 0
came 0
from 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
where, 0
for 0
a 0
single 0
surviving 0
autonomous 0
monastery 0
and 0
an 0
average 0
age 0
of 0
81, 0
resources 0
were 0
mobilised 0
to 0
create 0
“a 0
completely 0
new 0
structure,” 0
complete 0
with 0
approval 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0

[NB, 0
the 0

What 0
has 0
been 0
done: 0
13 0
Dutch 0
Carmels 0
and 0
one 0
in 0
Iceland 0
have 0
united 0
in 0
a 0
Federation. 0

This 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
close 0
communion 0
from 0
the 0
beginning. 0

Everyone 0
has 0
collaborated 0
in 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
amalgamations 0
and 0
suppressions. 0

Present 0
Problems: 0
Only 0
one 0
Carmel 0
functions 0
fully 0
autonomously 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands. 0

4 0
communities 0
are 0
in 0
a 0
care-home 0
run 0
by 0
the 0
Brothers 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
Conception. 0

Another 0
Carmel 0
was 0
renewed 0
in 0
1990. 0

At 0
the 0
original 0
Carmel 0
an 0
infirmary 0
wing 0
has 0
been 0
added 0
for 0
those 0
sisters 0
who 0
require 0
nursing; 0
it 0
is 0
run 0
by 0
Franciscan 0
sisters. 0

With 0
the 0
passing 0
of 0
time 0
the 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
has 0
transferred 0
tasks 0
to 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
faculties 0
described 0
in 0
the 0
statutes, 0
in 0
particular 0
regarding 0
our 0
mutual 0
solidarity. 0

Also, 0
with 0
the 0
passing 0
of 0
the 0
years, 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
has 0
placed 0
responsibility 0
directly 0
into 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

Finally, 0
the 0
autonomous 0
Carmels 0
have 0
asked 0
help 0
from 0
the 0
Federation 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
protect 0
their 0
interests. 0

Due 0
to 0
our 0
very 0
advanced 0
age 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
we 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
moment 0
when 0
a 0
General 0
Assembly 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
possible. 0

We 0
are 0
left 0
with 0
the 0
problem 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
communities 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
sisters 0
who 0
can 0
or 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
prioresses 0
or 0
council 0
sisters. 0

The 0
structure 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
had 0
till 0
now 0
is 0
thus 0
no 0
longer 0
possible. 0

Possible 0
solutions: 0
The 0
Federation 0
Council, 0
the 0
Religious 0
Assistant, 0
together 0
with 0
a 0
canon 0
lawyer 0
of 0
the 0
Dutch 0
Conference 0
of 0
Religious, 0
have 0
worked 0
hard 0
on 0
a 0
completely 0
new 0
structure, 0
in 0
which 0
in 0
its 0
first 0
draft 0
the 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
Carmel 0
has 0
been 0
constantly 0
kept 0
in 0
mind. 0

We 0
began 0
from 0
three 0
points: 0

1)Maintenance 0
of 0
the 0
formal 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
Carmels 0
that 0
still 0
exist, 0
but 0
with 0
the 0
chance 0
to 0
transfer 0
tasks 0
gradually 0
to 0
the 0
council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

2)Appointment 0

of 0
The 0
Federal 0
board 0
or 0
Federal 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
preferably 0
appointed 0
by 0
the 0
Superior 0
General. 0

The 0
team 0
will 0
consist 0
of 0
a 0
president 0
and 0
vice-president 0
who 0
are 0
members 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
convents, 0
appointed 0
to 0
functions, 0
and 0
of 0
three 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
members, 0
or 0
not, 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
convents. 0

3)A 0

Supervisory 0
council, 0
also 0
to 0
be 0
appointed 0
periodically 0
by 0
the 0
Superior 0
General, 0
which 0
will 0
be 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
three 0
members, 0
whose 0
president 0
will 0
be, 0
preferably, 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
religious 0
institute, 0
preferably 0
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
and 0
appointed 0
to 0
functions. 0

This 0
council 0
sees 0
itself 0
as 0
a 0
supervisory 0
body 0
and 0
to 0
give 0
advice 0
that 0
will 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
replace 0
the 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

In 0
October 0
2008, 0
the 0
President, 0
the 0
Religious 0
Assistant 0
and 0
a 0
Lawyer 0
were 0
in 0
Rome 0
where 0
they 0
explained 0
the 0
proposals. 0

They 0
had 0
meetings 0
with 0
Fr. 0

General 0
and 0
with 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious. 0

These 0
were 0
open 0
meetings 0
that 0
helped 0
us 0
to 0
clarify 0
matters. 0

An 0
important 0
concern 0
was 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
allow 0
us 0
to 0
use 0
lay 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
Federal 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
and 0
the 0
Supervisory 0
council. 0

We 0
were 0
aware 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
not 0
dealing 0
with 0
a 0
simple 0
matter, 0
but 0
we 0
think 0
that, 0
in 0
view 0
of 0
our 0
present 0
situation 0
today, 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
much 0
choice. 0

It 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
interests 0
of 0
our 0
Federation 0
in 0
the 0
most 0
responsible 0
and 0
careful 0
way, 0
so 0
that 0
all 0
the 0
sisters, 0
even 0
those 0
advanced 0
in 0
years, 0
can 0
continue 0
to 0
live 0
their 0
life 0
in 0
Carmel. 0

Definitive 0
permission 0
came 0
at 0
the 0
25th 0
of 0
February. 0

~~~ 0

Given 0
this 0
incredible 1
picture 0
of 0
a 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
rattle 0
of 0
its 0
death 1
throes, 1
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
summaries 0
of 0
speeches 0
given 0
at 0
the 0
meeting 0
in 0
Avila 0
read 0
as 0
outright 0
surreal, 0
leaving 0
us 0
to 0
wonder 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
these 0
people 0
are 0
attached 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
to 0
reality. 0

Sr. 0
Enrica 0
Rosanna, 0
the 0
representative 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
told 0
them 0
that 0
the 0
“two 0
great 0
challenges 0
to 0
our 0
contemplative 0
life” 0
are 0
“the 0
challenge 0
of 0
globalization 0
and 0
the 0
challenge 0
of 0
irrelevancy.” 0
She 0
warned 0
the 0
nuns 0
against 0
bringing 0
vocations 0
from 0
other 0
countries 0
to 0
keep 0
their 0
monasteries 0
alive, 0
dropping 0
a 0
hint 0
about 0
what 0
now 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
particular 0
obsession 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation. 0

Cor 0
orans 0
would 0
take 0
this 0
subject 0
up 0
definitively 0
in 0
2018: 0

The 0
nuns 0
were 0
exhorted 0
to 0
“stay 0
awake 0
to 0
welcome 0
the 0
dawn” 0
of 0
a 0
bright 0
new 0
future: 0

“These 0
are 0
difficult 0
and 0
uncertain 0
times, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
stay 0
awake 0
as 0
the 0
new 0
dawn 0
is 0
already 0
announcing 0
itself.” 0
“Our 0
aim 0
must 0
be 0
to 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
future. 0

We 0
should 0
not 0
forget 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
following 0
in 0
the 0
tradition 0
of 0
Teresa 0
of 0
Jesus 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
tradition 0
of 0
all 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
followed 0
in 0
her 0
footsteps. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
wide 0
road 0
that 0
opens 0
up 0
before 0
us. 0

We 0
must 0
be 0
women 0
of 0
hope 0
and 0
faith. 0

We 0
must 0
always 0
believe 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
who 0
directs 0
history. 0

From 0
this 0
derives 0
our 0
task, 0
to 0
be 0
creative 0
and, 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
faithful 0
(creative 0
fidelity).” 0
[emphasis 0
in 0
the 0
original.] 0

While 0
there 0
can 0
be 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
the 0
impending 1
total 1
extinction 1
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
in 0
Western 0
Europe 0
was 0
foremost 0
in 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
the 0
nuns 0
present, 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
the 0
issue 0
was 0
simply 0
not 0
addressed 0
out 0
loud 0
by 0
the 0
representatives 0
of 0
the 0
bureaucracy. 0

Instead, 0
Sr. 0
Enrica, 0
after 0
this 0
bizarre 0
and 0
cryptic 0
comment, 0
spoke 0
of 0
the 0
“problems 0
and 0
difficulties 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
encounter” 0
in 0
discernment 0
of 0
mostly 0
non-existent 0
vocations, 0
including 0
“consumerism, 0
modern 0
means 0
of 0
communication, 0
difficulties 0
in 0
creating 0
a 0
stable 0
personality, 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
young, 0
the 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
always 0
supported, 0
the 0
ideology 0
of 0
subjectivism.” 0

What 1
are 1
these 1
people 1
smoking? 1

Given 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
three 0
years 0
or 0
more 0
from 0
the 0
abdication 0
of 0
Benedict 0
and 0
the 0
installation 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
of 0
Francis/Kasper, 0
one 0
wonders 0
what 0
this 0
“new 0
dawn” 0
was 0
actually 0
about. 0

Perhaps 0
a 0
useful 0
question 0
for 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
nuns 0
present 0
could 0
have 0
been, 0
“A 0
‘new 1
dawn’ 1
of 0
what, 0
exactly?” 0
This 0
kind 0
of 0
coded 0
language 0
has 0
been 0
popular 0
with 0
the 0
progressivist 0
faction 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
since 0
the 0
1960s, 0
when 0
the 0
expectation 0
was 0
for 0
the 0
installation 0
of 0
a 0
totally 0
new 0
Church. 0

Was 0
Sr. 0
Enrica 0
somehow 0
anticipating 0
the 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
those 0
hippie-era 0
dreams 0
in 0
the 0
years 0
to 0
come? 0

It 0
is 0
certainly 0
clear 0
from 0
Francis’ 0
first 0
acts 0
as 0
pope 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
dealing 0
with 0
conservative 0
and 0
Traditionalist 0
nuns 0
high 0
on 0
his 0
list 0
of 0
priorities. 0

His 0
first 0
appointment, 0
no 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
weeks 0
after 0
the 0
Conclave 0
was 0
Jose 0
Rodrigues 0
Carballo, 0
the 0
Religious 0
Congregation’s 0
Secretary 0
and 0
– 0
given 0
the 0
scandal 0
that 0
erupted 0
on 0
his 0
leaving 0
them 0
– 0
the 0
financial 0
wrecking 0
ball 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
Minor. 0

The 0
first 0
task 0
Francis 0
gave 0
Carballo 0
was 0
the 0
demolition 1
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate. 0

Certainly 0
this 0
record 0
of 0
the 0
European 0
Carmelites’ 0
meeting 0
is 0
jammed 0
with 0
hints 0
that 0
Cor 0
orans 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
way. 0

On 0
the 0
final 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
meeting, 0
the 0
“theme 0
for 0
the 0
day” 0
was 0
offered 0
by 0
then-Father 0
General 0
Luis 0
Arostegui: 0
“Government: 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
change. 0

Autonomy 0
and 0
Association; 0
autonomy 0
and 0
Fr. 0

General; 0
other 0
solutions 0
to 0
government.” 0

The 0
devolution 0
of 0
authority 0
of 0
superiors 0
of 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
to 0
federations 0
was 0
obviously 0
on 0
someone’s 0
mind, 0
as 0
was 0
a 0
plan 0
to 0
see 0
to 0
it 0
that 0
monasteries 0
change 0
superiors 0
frequently: 0
“Essential 0
autonomy 0
can 0
fail 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
relationships 0
within 0
the 0
community: 0
abuses 0
by 0
permanent 0
superiors 0
who 0
decide 0
on 0
the 0
freedom 0
and 0
decisions 0
of 0
the 0
community,” 0
the 0
Father 0
General 0
warned. 0

And 0
there 0
were 0
certainly 0
hints 0
that 0
a 0
general 0
re-organisation 0
of 0
structures 0
of 0
authority 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
works. 0

A 0
common 0
tactic 0
of 0
politicians 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
initiate 0
changes 0
is 0
to 0
“ask 0
questions” 0
rather 0
than 0
make 0
suggestions, 0
and 0
Arostegui 0
asked 0
some 0
very 0
leading 0
questions 0
indeed 0
in 0
this 0
closing 0
address: 0

“Who 0
discerns 0
the 0
existence 0
or 0
not 0
of 0
vital 0
autonomy; 0
is 0
it 0
the 0
community 0
or 0
chosen 0
people? 0

“Are 0
there 0
instances 0
that 0
work 0
well 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
which 0
balance 0
autonomy 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
helpful 0
in 0
these 0
situations? 0

“At 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
she 0
was 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
someone 0
balanced. 0

Stability 0
is 0
one 0
reason 0
[for 0
autonomy], 0
but 0
is 0
stability 0
understood 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
it 0
can 0
obstruct 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
mission 0
and 0
your 0
availability 0
to 0
the 0
Order 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
Church? 0

“The 0
valiant 0
and 0
prophetic 0
initiative 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
to 0
create 0
Associations 0
and 0
Federations 0
opened 0
up 0
contemplative 0
life, 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
also 0
thought 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
harm 0
cloister 0
and 0
autonomy. 0

Can 0
such 0
essential 0
autonomy 0
continue 0
as 0
it 0
is? 0

“50 0
years 0
ago 0
there 0
was 0
stability. 0

How 0
do 0
we 0
conceive 0
today 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
autonomy 0
and 0
Federation-Association 0
and 0
between 0
autonomy 0
and 0
Fr. 0

General? 0

“Could 0
there 0
be 0
other 0
forms 0
of 0
government?” 0

Following 0
the 0
Father 0
General’s 0
address 0
are 0
notes 0
from 0
the 0
language 0
groups, 0
including 0
the 0
following: 0

“While 0
some 0
communities 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
their 0
autonomy 0
to 0
be 0
touched, 0
and 0
have 0
certain 0
fears 0
of 0
‘external’ 0
interference, 0
others 0
want 0
a 0
more 0
moderate 0
and 0
flexible 0
autonomy 0
that, 0
without 0
going 0
to 0
the 0
Congregation 0
would 0
have 0
a 0
juridical 0
form, 0
where 0
the 0
President 0
with 0
her 0
Council 0
can 0
intervene 0
in 0
extreme 0
cases 0
that 0
today 0
we 0
watch 0
with 0
pain, 0
our 0
hands 0
tied. 0

Though 0
we 0
want 0
these 0
legal 0
channels 0
to 0
be 0
established, 0
it 0
must 0
remain 0
clear 0
what 0
the 0
limits 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
Council 0
are, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
abuses 0
of 0
power 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
same.” 0
“...The 0
absence 0
of 0
vital 0
autonomy 0
is 0
also 0
noticed 0
when… 0
the 0
same 0
person 0
remains 0
prioress 0
for 0
years.” 0
“...We 0
need 0
criteria 0
that 0
expand 0
number 0
203 0
of 0
our 0
Constitutions 0
and 0
clarify 0
vital 0
autonomy. 0

We 0
perceive 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
shortage 0
of 0
authority 0
figures. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
new 0
figures 0
but 0
rather 0
those 0
that 0
already 0
exist 0
(Associations, 0
[federation] 0
Presidents, 0
Provincials...) 0
be 0
empowered 0
in 0
a 0
legal 0
way 0
(canonically) 0
to 0
help 0
communities 0
in 0
difficulty, 0
for 0
the 0
mission 0
to 0
discern, 0
to 0
counsel, 0
to 0
accompany.” 0
“...We 0
are 0
also 0
concerned 0
for 0
those 0
communities 0
not 0
affiliated 0
to 0
Federations, 0
we 0
see 0
that 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
close 0
to 0
them.” 0

Maybe 0
this 0
summary 0
document 0
of 0
2009 0
can 0
give 0
us 0
an 0
idea 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
from 0
Rome 0
in 0
2018, 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
“progressivist” 0
faction 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
ascendancy 0
and 0
is 0
free 0
to 0
act 0
without 0
restriction. 0

What 0
comes 0
clear 0
comparing 0
this 0
document 0
to 0
Cor 0
orans 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
machinery 0
has 0
long 0
been 0
at 0
work 0
forcing 0
a 0
uniform 0
and 0
essentially 0
bureaucratic, 0
heavily 0
authoritarian 0
and 0
legalistic 0
vision 0
of 0
contemplative 0
life 0
on 0
anyone 0
who 0
fails 0
sufficiently 0
to 0
resist 0
it. 0

And 0
with 0
the 0
statistics 0
offered 0
at 0
this 0
meeting 0
we 0
can 0
see 0
clearly 0
where 0
this 0
road 0
leads. 0

So 0
many 0
Catholics 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
40 0
years 0
assumed 0
that 0
under 0
the 0
“conservatives” 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
at 0
least 0
the 0
Vatican 0
was 0
“onside.” 0
At 0
least 0
in 0
Rome 0
they 0
understood 0
the 0
terrible 1
threat 0
of 0
the 0
Bolshie 0
VaticanTwoist 0
revolutionaries. 0

But 0
this 0
report 0
of 0
2009 0
shows 0
a 0
clear 0
picture 0
of 0
a 0
Roman 0
congregation 0
determined 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
revolution 0
through 0
to 0
its 0
inevitable 0
conclusion. 0

An 0
aside 0
that 0
will 0
perhaps 0
be 0
noteworthy 0
to 0
traditionalist 0
readers 0
is 0
the 0
little 0
comment 0
in 0
the 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
difficulty 0
of 0
having 0
a 0
liturgical 0
observance 0
between 0
all 0
the 0
disparate 0
nations 0
represented 0
at 0
the 0
meeting. 0

“Eucharist 0
and 0
Lauds 0
in 0
Spanish. 0

Fr. 0

Isidore 0
D’Silva 0
had 0
prepared 0
a 0
booklet 0
with 0
the 0
liturgy 0
for 0
each 0
day. 0

Each 0
psalm 0
was 0
in 0
a 0
different 0
language, 0
and 0
was 0
prepared 0
by 0
the 0
corresponding 0
liturgical 0
group. 0

However, 0
having 0
the 0
text 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
us 0
made 0
it 0
easier 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
recitation 0
in 0
other 0
languages. 0

The 0
end 0
result 0
was 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
all 0
join 0
in 0
the 0
liturgy. 0

We 0
were 0
all 0
united 0
in 0
the 0
praise 0
of 0
the 0
Spirit 0
who 0
had 0
brought 0
us 0
there 0
together 0
from 0
different 0
languages 0
and 0
nations.” 0

[2] 0
Solution: 0
new 0
foundations, 0
the 0
spreading 0
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0

into 0
