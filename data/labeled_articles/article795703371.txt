“Hopefully 0

added. 0

“All 0

Not 0
only 0
did 0
Trump 0
threaten 0
to 0
send 0
the 0
military 0
to 0
the 0
border, 0
but 0
he 0
also 0
threatened 0
to 0
stop 0
all 0
federal 0
payments 0
to 0
Guatemala, 0
Honduras, 0
and 0
El 0
Salvador 0
if 0
they 0
didn't 0
block 0
the 0
caravan. 0

The 0
obvious 0
question 0
I 0
have 0
is: 0
Why 0
are 0
you 0
not 0
stopping 0
those 0
payments 0
now, 0
Mr. 0
President? 0

They 0
are 0
unconstitutional 1
and 0
neither 0
Congress 0
nor 0
you 0
have 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
give 0
American's 1
money 0
to 0
these 0
countries. 0

Trump 0
also 0
seemed 0
ready 0
to 0
back 0
out 0
on 0
his 0
new 0
trade 0
deal, 0
which 0
is 0
hardly 0
a 0
deal 0
for 0
the 0
US, 0
with 0
Mexico 0
if 0
they 0
failed 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
caravan. 0

He 0
then 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
many 0
who 0
cross 0
the 0
border 0
are 0
criminals 0
and 0
are 0
coming 1
to 1
engage 1
in 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

In 0
fact, 0
every 0
single 0
migrant 0
who 0
crosses 0
over 0
into 0
our 0
country 0
will 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
commit 0
at 0
least 0
28 0
crimes 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
present 0
themselves 0
as 0
legal. 0

“The 0
assault 0
on 0
our 0
country 0
at 0

Southern 0
Border, 0
including 0
the 0
Criminal 0

as 0

than 0

or 0
the 0
USMCA,” 0
he 0
wrote. 0

The 0
USMCA 0
is 0
a 0
disaster 1
and 0
should 0
be 0
done 0
away 0
with 0
without 0
this 0
threat 0
of 0
a 0
caravan 0
of 0
migrants. 0

We'll 0
see 0
if 0
these 0
countries 0
stop 0
the 0
migrants 0
or 0
if 0
it 0
continues 0
to 0
the 0
border. 0

If 0
they 0
make 0
it 0
here 0
and 0
Trump 0
does 0
nothing 0
but 0
arrest 0
them 0
and 0
put 0
them 0
through 0
the 0
system 0
rather 0
than 0
simply 0
turning 0
them 0
away, 0
then 0
you 0
know 0
the 0
words 0
are 0
empty 0
and 0
hollow. 0

Time 0
will 0
tell 0
what 0
will 0
take 0
place. 0
