“There 0 258 7

fakery 1 258 11
of 0 258 11

not 0 258 12

they 0 258 12
have 1 258 12
not 1 258 12
destroyed 1 258 12
the 1 258 12

Only 1 258 13
the 1 258 13

Dennis 0 258 18
Bernstein: 0 258 18
We 0 258 18
continue 0 258 18
our 0 258 18
discussion 0 258 18
of 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
case 0 258 18
of 0 258 18
Julian 0 258 18
Assange, 0 258 18
now 0 258 18
in 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
Ecuadorian 0 258 18
embassy 0 258 18
in 0 258 18
Great 0 258 18

John 0 258 19
Pilger, 0 258 19
it 0 258 19
is 0 258 19
great 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
talk 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
you 0 258 19
again. 0 258 19

But 0 258 20
it 0 258 20
is 0 258 20
a 1 258 20
profound 1 258 20
tragedy, 1 258 20
John, 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
way 0 258 20
they 0 258 20
are 0 258 20
treating 0 258 20
Julian 0 258 20
Assange, 0 258 20
this 0 258 20
prolific 1 258 20
journalist 1 258 20
and 1 258 20
publisher 1 258 20
who 0 258 20
so 0 258 20
many 0 258 20
other 0 258 20
journalists 0 258 20
have 0 258 20
depended 0 258 20
on 0 258 20
in 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
past. 0 258 20

He 0 258 21
has 0 258 21
been 0 258 21
totally 1 258 21
left 1 258 21
out 1 258 21
in 1 258 21
the 1 258 21
cold 1 258 21
to 1 258 21
fend 1 258 21
for 1 258 21
himself. 1 258 21

John 0 258 22
Pilger: 0 258 22
I 0 258 22
have 0 258 22
never 0 258 22
known 0 258 22
anything 0 258 22
like 0 258 22
it. 0 258 22

There 0 258 23
is 0 258 23
a 0 258 23
kind 0 258 23
of 0 258 23
eerie 1 258 23
silence 1 258 23
around 0 258 23
the 0 258 23
Julian 0 258 23
Assange 0 258 23
case. 0 258 23

Julian 0 258 24
has 0 258 24
been 0 258 24
vindicated 0 258 24
in 0 258 24
every 0 258 24
possible 0 258 24
way 0 258 24
and 0 258 24
yet 0 258 24
he 0 258 24
is 0 258 24
isolated 0 258 24
as 0 258 24
few 0 258 24
people 0 258 24
are 0 258 24
these 0 258 24
days. 0 258 24

He 0 258 25
is 0 258 25
cut 0 258 25
off 0 258 25
from 0 258 25
the 0 258 25
very 0 258 25
tools 0 258 25
of 0 258 25
his 0 258 25
trade, 0 258 25
visitors 0 258 25
aren’t 0 258 25
allowed. 0 258 25

I 0 258 26
was 0 258 26
in 0 258 26
London 0 258 26
recently 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
I 0 258 26
couldn’t 0 258 26
see 0 258 26
him, 0 258 26
although 0 258 26
I 0 258 26
spoke 0 258 26
to 0 258 26
people 0 258 26
who 0 258 26
had 0 258 26
seen 0 258 26
him. 0 258 26

Rafael 0 258 27
Correa, 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
former 0 258 27
president 0 258 27
of 0 258 27
Ecuador, 0 258 27
said 0 258 27
recently 0 258 27
that 0 258 27
he 1 258 27
regarded 1 258 27
what 1 258 27
they 1 258 27
are 1 258 27
doing 1 258 27
to 1 258 27
Julian 1 258 27
now 1 258 27
as 1 258 27
torture. 1 258 27

It 0 258 28
was 0 258 28
Correa’s 0 258 28
government 0 258 28
that 0 258 28
gave 0 258 28
Julian 0 258 28
political 0 258 28
refuge, 0 258 28
which 0 258 28
has 0 258 28
been 0 258 28
betrayed 0 258 28
now 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
his 0 258 28
successor, 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
government 0 258 28
led 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
Lenin 0 258 28
Moreno, 0 258 28
which 0 258 28
is 0 258 28
back 0 258 28
to 0 258 28
sucking 1 258 28
up 1 258 28
to 1 258 28
the 1 258 28
United 1 258 28
States 1 258 28
in 1 258 28
the 1 258 28
time-honored 1 258 28
way, 1 258 28
with 0 258 28
Julian 0 258 28
as 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
pawn 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
victim. 0 258 28

Should 0 258 29
be 0 258 29
a 1 258 29
‘Constitutional 1 258 29
Hero’ 1 258 29

But 0 258 30
really 0 258 30
it 0 258 30
comes 0 258 30
down 0 258 30
to 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
British 0 258 30
government. 0 258 30

Although 0 258 31
he 0 258 31
is 0 258 31
still 0 258 31
in 0 258 31
a 0 258 31
foreign 0 258 31
embassy 0 258 31
and 0 258 31
actually 0 258 31
has 0 258 31
Ecuadorian 0 258 31
nationality, 0 258 31
his 0 258 31
right 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
passage 0 258 31
out 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
that 0 258 31
embassy 0 258 31
should 0 258 31
be 0 258 31
guaranteed 0 258 31
by 0 258 31
the 0 258 31
British 0 258 31
government. 0 258 31

The 0 258 32
United 0 258 32
Nations 0 258 32
Working 0 258 32
Party 0 258 32
on 0 258 32
Unlawful 0 258 32
Detentions 0 258 32
has 0 258 32
made 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
clear. 0 258 32

Britain 0 258 33
took 0 258 33
part 0 258 33
in 0 258 33
an 0 258 33
investigation 0 258 33
which 0 258 33
determined 0 258 33
that 0 258 33
Julian 0 258 33
was 0 258 33
a 0 258 33
political 0 258 33
refugee 0 258 33
and 0 258 33
that 0 258 33
a 1 258 33
great 1 258 33
miscarriage 1 258 33
of 1 258 33
justice 1 258 33
had 0 258 33
been 0 258 33
imposed 0 258 33
on 0 258 33
him. 0 258 33

It 0 258 34
is 0 258 34
very 0 258 34
good 0 258 34
that 0 258 34
you 0 258 34
are 0 258 34
doing 0 258 34
this, 0 258 34
Dennis, 0 258 34
because 0 258 34
even 0 258 34
in 0 258 34
the 0 258 34
media 0 258 34
outside 0 258 34
the 0 258 34
mainstream, 0 258 34
there 0 258 34
is 0 258 34
this 0 258 34
silence 0 258 34
about 0 258 34
Julian. 0 258 34

The 0 258 35
streets 0 258 35
outside 0 258 35
the 0 258 35
embassy 0 258 35
are 1 258 35
virtually 1 258 35
empty, 1 258 35
whereas 0 258 35
they 1 258 35
should 1 258 35
be 1 258 35
full 1 258 35
of 1 258 35
people 1 258 35
saying 1 258 35
that 1 258 35
we 1 258 35
are 1 258 35
with 1 258 35
you. 1 258 35

The 0 258 36
principles 0 258 36
involved 0 258 36
in 0 258 36
this 0 258 36
case 0 258 36
are 0 258 36
absolutely 1 258 36
clear-cut. 1 258 36

Number 0 258 37
one 0 258 37
is 0 258 37
justice. 0 258 37

The 1 258 38
injustice 1 258 38
done 1 258 38
to 1 258 38
this 1 258 38
man 1 258 38
is 1 258 38
legion, 1 258 38
both 0 258 38
in 0 258 38
terms 0 258 38
of 0 258 38
the 1 258 38
bogus 1 258 38
Swedish 1 258 38
case 1 258 38
and 0 258 38
now 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
fact 0 258 38
that 0 258 38
he 0 258 38
must 0 258 38
remain 0 258 38
in 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
embassy 0 258 38
and 0 258 38
can’t 0 258 38
leave 0 258 38
without 0 258 38
being 0 258 38
arrested, 0 258 38
extradited 0 258 38
to 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
United 0 258 38
States 0 258 38
and 0 258 38
ending 1 258 38
up 1 258 38
in 1 258 38
a 1 258 38
hell 1 258 38
hole. 1 258 38

But 1 258 39
it 1 258 39
is 1 258 39
also 1 258 39
about 1 258 39
freedom 1 258 39
of 1 258 39
speech, 1 258 39
about 1 258 39
our 1 258 39
right 1 258 39
to 1 258 39
know, 1 258 39
which 1 258 39
is 1 258 39
enshrined 1 258 39
in 1 258 39
the 1 258 39
United 1 258 39
States 1 258 39
Constitution. 1 258 39

If 0 258 40
the 0 258 40
Constitution 0 258 40
were 0 258 40
taken 0 258 40
literally, 0 258 40
Julian 0 258 40
would 0 258 40
be 0 258 40
a 1 258 40
constitutional 1 258 40
hero, 1 258 40
actually. 0 258 40

Instead, 0 258 41
I 0 258 41
understand 0 258 41
the 0 258 41
indictment 0 258 41
they 0 258 41
are 0 258 41
trying 0 258 41
to 0 258 41
concoct 0 258 41
reads 0 258 41
like 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
charge 0 258 41
of 0 258 41
espionage! 0 258 41

It’s 1 258 42
so 1 258 42
ridiculous.That 1 258 42
is 0 258 42
the 0 258 42
situation 0 258 42
as 0 258 42
I 0 258 42
see 0 258 42
it, 0 258 42
Dennis. 0 258 42

It 0 258 43
is 0 258 43
not 0 258 43
a 0 258 43
happy 0 258 43
one 0 258 43
but 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
is 0 258 43
one 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
people 0 258 43
should 0 258 43
rally 0 258 43
to 0 258 43
quickly. 0 258 43

DB: 0 258 44
His 1 258 44
journalistic 1 258 44
brethren 1 258 44
are 0 258 44
sounding 0 258 44
like 0 258 44
his 0 258 44
prosecutors. 0 258 44

They 0 258 45
want 0 258 45
to 0 258 45
get 0 258 45
behind 0 258 45
Russia-gate 1 258 45
freaks 1 258 45
like 0 258 45
Congressman 0 258 45
Adam 0 258 45
Schiff 0 258 45
and 0 258 45
Mike 0 258 45
Pompeo, 0 258 45
who 0 258 45
would 0 258 45
like 0 258 45
to 0 258 45
see 0 258 45
Assange 0 258 45
in 1 258 45
jail 1 258 45
forever 1 258 45
or 1 258 45
even 1 258 45
executed. 1 258 45

How 0 258 46
do 0 258 46
you 0 258 46
respond 0 258 46
to 0 258 46
journalists 0 258 46
acting 0 258 46
like 0 258 46
prosecutors, 0 258 46
some 0 258 46
of 0 258 46
whom 0 258 46
used 0 258 46
his 0 258 46
material 0 258 46
to 0 258 46
do 0 258 46
stories? 0 258 46

This 0 258 47
is 0 258 47
a 0 258 47
terrible 0 258 47
time 0 258 47
for 0 258 47
journalism. 0 258 47

JP: 0 258 48
You 0 258 48
are 0 258 48
absolutely 0 258 48
right: 0 258 48
It 0 258 48
is 0 258 48
a 0 258 48
terrible 0 258 48
time 0 258 48
for 0 258 48
journalism. 0 258 48

I 1 258 49
have 1 258 49
never 1 258 49
known 1 258 49
anything 1 258 49
quite 1 258 49
like 1 258 49
it 1 258 49
in 1 258 49
my 1 258 49
career. 1 258 49

That 0 258 50
said, 0 258 50
it 0 258 50
is 0 258 50
not 0 258 50
new. 0 258 50

There 0 258 51
has 0 258 51
always 0 258 51
been 0 258 51
a 0 258 51
so-called 0 258 51
mainstream 0 258 51
which 0 258 51
really 0 258 51
comes 0 258 51
down 0 258 51
to 0 258 51
great 0 258 51
power 0 258 51
in 0 258 51
media. 0 258 51

It 0 258 52
has 0 258 52
always 0 258 52
existed, 0 258 52
particularly 0 258 52
in 0 258 52
the 0 258 52
United 0 258 52
States. 0 258 52

The 0 258 53
Pulitzer 0 258 53
Prize 0 258 53
this 0 258 53
year 0 258 53
was 0 258 53
awarded 0 258 53
to 0 258 53
The 0 258 53
New 0 258 53
York 0 258 53
Times 0 258 53
and 0 258 53
The 0 258 53
Washington 0 258 53
Post 0 258 53
for 0 258 53
witch-hunting 1 258 53
around 1 258 53
Russia-gate! 1 258 53

They 0 258 54
were 0 258 54
praised 0 258 54
for 0 258 54
“how 0 258 54
deeply 0 258 54
sourced 0 258 54
their 0 258 54
investigations 0 258 54
were.” 0 258 54
Their 1 258 54
investigations 1 258 54
turned 1 258 54
up 1 258 54
not 1 258 54
a 1 258 54
shred 1 258 54
of 1 258 54
real 1 258 54
evidence 1 258 54
to 0 258 54
suggest 0 258 54
any 0 258 54
serious 0 258 54
Russian 0 258 54
intervention 0 258 54
in 0 258 54
the 0 258 54
2016 0 258 54
election. 0 258 54

Like 0 258 55
Webb 0 258 55

The 0 258 56
Julian 0 258 56
Assange 0 258 56
case 0 258 56
reminds 0 258 56
me 0 258 56
of 0 258 56
the 0 258 56
Gary 0 258 56
Webb 0 258 56
case. 0 258 56

Bob 0 258 57
Parry 0 258 57
was 0 258 57
one 0 258 57
of 0 258 57
Gary 0 258 57
Webb’s 0 258 57
few 0 258 57
supporters 0 258 57
in 0 258 57
the 0 258 57
media. 0 258 57

Webb’s 0 258 58
“Dark 0 258 58
Alliance” 0 258 58
series 0 258 58
contained 0 258 58
evidence 0 258 58
that 0 258 58
cocaine 0 258 58
trafficking 0 258 58
was 0 258 58
going 0 258 58
on 0 258 58
with 0 258 58
the 0 258 58
connivance 0 258 58
of 0 258 58
the 0 258 58
CIA. 0 258 58

Later 0 258 59
Webb 0 258 59
was 1 258 59
hounded 1 258 59
by 0 258 59
fellow 0 258 59
journalists 0 258 59
and, 0 258 59
unable 0 258 59
to 0 258 59
find 0 258 59
work, 0 258 59
he 0 258 59
eventually 0 258 59
committed 0 258 59
suicide. 0 258 59

The 0 258 60
CIA 0 258 60
Inspector 0 258 60
General 0 258 60
subsequently 0 258 60
vindicated 0 258 60
him. 0 258 60

Now, 0 258 61
Julian 0 258 61
Assange 0 258 61
is 0 258 61
a 0 258 61
long 0 258 61
way 0 258 61
from 0 258 61
taking 0 258 61
his 0 258 61
own 0 258 61
life. 0 258 61

His 0 258 62
resilience 0 258 62
is 0 258 62
remarkable. 0 258 62

But 0 258 63
he 0 258 63
is 0 258 63
still 0 258 63
a 0 258 63
human 0 258 63
being 0 258 63
and 0 258 63
he 0 258 63
has 0 258 63
taken 1 258 63
such 1 258 63
a 1 258 63
battering. 1 258 63

Probably 0 258 64
the 0 258 64
hardest 0 258 64
thing 0 258 64
for 0 258 64
him 0 258 64
to 0 258 64
take 0 258 64
is 0 258 64
the 1 258 64
utter 1 258 64
hypocrisy 1 258 64
of 1 258 64
news 1 258 64
organizations—like 1 258 64
The 0 258 64
New 0 258 64
York 0 258 64
Times, 0 258 64
which 0 258 64
published 0 258 64
the 0 258 64
WikiLeaks 0 258 64
“War 0 258 64
Logs” 0 258 64
and 0 258 64
“Cablegate,” 0 258 64
The 0 258 64
Washington 0 258 64
Post 0 258 64
and 0 258 64
The 0 258 64
Guardian, 0 258 64
which 0 258 64
has 0 258 64
taken 0 258 64
a 1 258 64
vindictive 1 258 64
delight 1 258 64
in 1 258 64
tormenting 1 258 64
Julian. 1 258 64

The 0 258 65
Guardian 0 258 65
a 0 258 65
few 0 258 65
years 0 258 65
ago 0 258 65
got 0 258 65
a 0 258 65
Pulitzer 0 258 65
Prize 0 258 65
writing 0 258 65
about 0 258 65
Snowden. 0 258 65

But 0 258 66
their 0 258 66
coverage 0 258 66
of 0 258 66
Snowden 0 258 66
left 0 258 66
him 0 258 66
in 0 258 66
Hong 0 258 66
Kong. 0 258 66

It 0 258 67
was 0 258 67
WikiLeaks 0 258 67
that 0 258 67
got 0 258 67
Snowden 0 258 67
out 0 258 67
of 0 258 67
Hong 0 258 67
Kong 0 258 67
and 0 258 67
to 0 258 67
safety. 0 258 67

Professionally, 0 258 68
I 1 258 68
find 1 258 68
this 1 258 68
one 1 258 68
of 1 258 68
the 1 258 68
most 1 258 68
unsavory 1 258 68
and 1 258 68
immoral 1 258 68
things 1 258 68
I 1 258 68
have 1 258 68
seen 1 258 68
in 1 258 68
my 1 258 68
career. 1 258 68

The 0 258 69
persecution 0 258 69
of 0 258 69
this 0 258 69
man 0 258 69
by 0 258 69
huge 0 258 69
media 0 258 69
organizations 0 258 69
which 0 258 69
have 0 258 69
drawn 0 258 69
great 0 258 69
benefit 0 258 69
from 0 258 69
WikiLeaks. 0 258 69

One 1 258 70
of 1 258 70
Assange’s 1 258 70
great 1 258 70
tormentors, 1 258 70
The 1 258 70
Guardian‘s 1 258 70
Luke 1 258 70
Harding, 1 258 70
made 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
great 0 258 70
deal 0 258 70
of 0 258 70
money 0 258 70
with 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
Hollywood 0 258 70
version 0 258 70
of 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
book 0 258 70
that 0 258 70
he 0 258 70
and 0 258 70
David 0 258 70
Lee 0 258 70
wrote 0 258 70
in 0 258 70
which 0 258 70
they 0 258 70
basically 0 258 70
attacked 0 258 70
their 0 258 70
source. 0 258 70

I 0 258 71
suppose 0 258 71
you 0 258 71
have 0 258 71
to 0 258 71
be 0 258 71
a 0 258 71
psychiatrist 0 258 71
to 0 258 71
understand 0 258 71
all 0 258 71
of 0 258 71
this. 0 258 71

My 0 258 72
understanding 0 258 72
is 0 258 72
that 0 258 72
so 0 258 72
many 0 258 72
of 0 258 72
these 0 258 72
journalists 0 258 72
are 0 258 72
shamed. 0 258 72

They 0 258 73
realize 0 258 73
that 0 258 73
WikiLeaks 0 258 73
has 0 258 73
done 0 258 73
what 0 258 73
they 0 258 73
should 0 258 73
have 0 258 73
done 0 258 73
a 0 258 73
long 0 258 73
time 0 258 73
ago, 0 258 73
and 0 258 73
that 0 258 73
is 0 258 73
to 0 258 73
tell 0 258 73
us 0 258 73
how 0 258 73
governments 0 258 73
lie. 0 258 73

DB: 0 258 74
One 0 258 74
thing 0 258 74
that 0 258 74
disturbs 0 258 74
me 0 258 74
greatly 0 258 74
is 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
way 0 258 74
in 0 258 74
which 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
Western 0 258 74
corporate 0 258 74
press 0 258 74
speculate 0 258 74
about 0 258 74
Russian 0 258 74
involvement 0 258 74
in 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
U.S. 0 258 74
2016 0 258 74
election, 0 258 74
that 0 258 74
it 1 258 74
was 1 258 74
a 1 258 74
hack 1 258 74
through 1 258 74
Julian 1 258 74
Assange. 1 258 74

Any 0 258 75
serious 0 258 75
investigator 0 258 75
would 0 258 75
want 0 258 75
to 0 258 75
know 0 258 75
who 0 258 75
would 0 258 75
be 0 258 75
motivated. 0 258 75

And 0 258 76
yet 0 258 76
the 0 258 76
possibility 0 258 76
that 0 258 76
it 0 258 76
might 0 258 76
be 0 258 76
the 1 258 76

Sanders 0 258 78
and 0 258 78
the 0 258 78
way 0 258 78
that 0 258 78
he 1 258 78
was 1 258 78
rolled 1 258 78
by 1 258 78
the 1 258 78
Clinton 1 258 78
organization, 1 258 78
everybody 0 258 78
knows 0 258 78
that 0 258 78
this 0 258 78
is 0 258 78
the 0 258 78
story. 0 258 78

And 0 258 79
now 0 258 79
we 0 258 79
have 0 258 79
the 0 258 79
DNC 0 258 79
suing 0 258 79
WikiLeaks! 0 258 79

There’s 0 258 80
a 0 258 80
kind 0 258 80
of 0 258 80
farcical 1 258 80
element 1 258 80

this. 0 258 80

none 0 258 81

this 0 258 81
came 0 258 81
from 0 258 81
the 0 258 81
Russians. 0 258 81

That 0 258 82
WikiLeaks 0 258 82
is 0 258 82
somehow 0 258 82
in 1 258 82
bed 1 258 82
with 1 258 82
the 1 258 82
Russians 1 258 82
is 1 258 82
ludicrous. 1 258 82

WikiLeaks 0 258 83

800,000 0 258 83

a 0 258 85
very 0 258 85
high-profile 0 258 85

to 0 258 85
the 0 258 85

recently 0 258 85

with 0 258 86
Congressman 0 258 86

he 1 258 86
yelled 1 258 86
out 1 258 86
“What 0 258 86
about 0 258 86
Julian 0 258 86

was 0 258 86
attacked 0 258 86

dragged 0 258 86
out. 0 258 86

was 0 258 87
if 0 258 87
everyone 0 258 87
there 0 258 87
was 0 258 87

that 0 258 87
one 1 258 87
of 1 258 87
their 1 258 87

brutalized. 1 258 87

some 0 258 88
truth. 0 258 88

It 0 258 89
is 0 258 89
very 0 258 89
similar 0 258 89
to 0 258 89
what 0 258 89
happened 0 258 89
to 0 258 89

former 0 258 90
member 0 258 90
of 0 258 90
the 0 258 90

but 0 258 90
extremely 0 258 90
principled. 0 258 90

I 0 258 91
might 0 258 91
suggest 0 258 91
he 1 258 91
is 1 258 91
a 1 258 91
renegade 1 258 91
now. 0 258 91

to 0 258 92
watch 0 258 92
these 0 258 92
four 0 258 92
armed 0 258 92
guards 0 258 92
who 0 258 92
kept 0 258 92
shouting 0 258 92
“Stop 0 258 92

stop 0 258 92
resisting!” 0 258 92

beating 1 258 92
the 1 258 92
hell 1 258 92
out 1 258 92
of 1 258 92
him! 1 258 92

JP: 0 258 93
I 0 258 93
thought 0 258 93
the 0 258 93
image 0 258 93
of 0 258 93
Ray 0 258 93
being 1 258 93
hauled 1 258 93
off 1 258 93
was 0 258 93
particularly 0 258 93
telling. 0 258 93

These 1 258 94
four 1 258 94
overweight, 1 258 94
obviously 1 258 94
ill-trained 1 258 94
young 1 258 94
men 1 258 94
manhandling 1 258 94
Ray, 0 258 94
who 0 258 94
is 0 258 94
78 0 258 94
years 0 258 94
old. 0 258 94

There 0 258 95
was 0 258 95
something 0 258 95
highly 0 258 95
emblematic 0 258 95
about 0 258 95
that 0 258 95
for 0 258 95
me. 0 258 95

He 0 258 96
stood 0 258 96
up 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
challenge 0 258 96
the 0 258 96
fact 0 258 96
that 0 258 96
the 0 258 96
CIA 0 258 96
was 0 258 96
about 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
hand 0 258 96
over 0 258 96
leadership 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
a 0 258 96
person 0 258 96
who 0 258 96
had 0 258 96
been 0 258 96
in 0 258 96
charge 0 258 96
of 0 258 96
torture. 0 258 96

It 0 258 97
is 0 258 97
both 1 258 97
shocking 1 258 97
and 1 258 97
surreal, 1 258 97
which 0 258 97
of 0 258 97
course 0 258 97
the 0 258 97
Julian 0 258 97
Assange 0 258 97
case 0 258 97
is 0 258 97
as 0 258 97
well. 0 258 97

But 0 258 98
real 0 258 98
journalism 0 258 98
should 0 258 98
be 0 258 98
able 0 258 98
to 0 258 98
get 0 258 98
through 0 258 98
the 1 258 98
shocking 1 258 98
and 1 258 98
the 1 258 98
surreal 1 258 98
and 0 258 98
get 0 258 98
to 0 258 98
the 0 258 98
truth. 0 258 98

There 0 258 99
is 0 258 99
so 0 258 99
much 0 258 99
collusion 0 258 99
now, 0 258 99
with 0 258 99
all 0 258 99
these 0 258 99
dark 1 258 99
and 1 258 99
menacing 1 258 99
developments. 1 258 99

It 0 258 100
is 0 258 100
almost 0 258 100
as 0 258 100
if 0 258 100
the 1 258 100
word 1 258 100
“journalism” 1 258 100
is 1 258 100
becoming 1 258 100
blighted. 1 258 100

DB: 0 258 101
There 0 258 101
has 0 258 101
certainly 0 258 101
been 0 258 101
a 0 258 101
lot 0 258 101
of 0 258 101
collusion 0 258 101
when 0 258 101
it 0 258 101
comes 0 258 101
to 0 258 101

Then 0 258 102
the 0 258 102
word 0 258 102
“collusion” 0 258 102
is 0 258 102
quite 0 258 102
appropriate. 0 258 102

JP:That’s 0 258 103
the 0 258 103
ultimate 0 258 103
collusion. 0 258 103

But 0 258 104
that’s 0 258 104
collusion 1 258 104
with 0 258 104
silence. 0 258 104

Never 1 258 105
has 1 258 105
there 1 258 105
been 1 258 105
a 1 258 105
collusion 1 258 105
like 1 258 105
the 1 258 105
one 1 258 105
between 1 258 105
the 1 258 105
U.S. 1 258 105

Israel. 1 258 105

It 0 258 106

another 0 258 106
word 0 258 106
and 0 258 106
that 0 258 106
is 0 258 106
“immunity.” 0 258 106

a 0 258 106
moral 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
cultural 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
geopolitical 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
legal 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106

immunity. 1 258 106

occupation 0 258 108
of 0 258 108
their 0 258 108

Julian 0 258 117
feels 0 258 117
very 0 258 117
passionately 0 258 117
about 0 258 117
this. 0 258 117

There 0 258 118
were 0 258 118
times 0 258 118
when 0 258 118
he 0 258 118
could 0 258 118
have 0 258 118
compromised 0 258 118
slightly 0 258 118
in 0 258 118
order 0 258 118
to 0 258 118
possibly 0 258 118
help 0 258 118
his 0 258 118
situation. 0 258 118

There 0 258 119
were 0 258 119
times 0 258 119
when 0 258 119
I 0 258 119
said 0 258 119
to 0 258 119
him, 0 258 119
“Why 0 258 119
don’t 0 258 119
you 0 258 119
just 0 258 119
suspend 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
for 0 258 119
a 0 258 119
while 0 258 119
and 0 258 119
go 0 258 119
along 0 258 119
with 0 258 119
it?” 0 258 119
Of 0 258 119
course, 0 258 119
I 0 258 119
knew 0 258 119
beforehand 0 258 119
what 0 258 119
his 0 258 119
answer 0 258 119
would 0 258 119
be 0 258 119
and 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
was 0 258 119
“no.” 0 258 119
The 0 258 119
enormous 0 258 119
amount 0 258 119
of 0 258 119
information 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
has 0 258 119
come 0 258 119
from 0 258 119
WikiLeaks, 0 258 119
particularly 0 258 119
in 0 258 119
recent 0 258 119
years, 0 258 119
has 0 258 119
amounted 0 258 119
to 0 258 119
an 1 258 119
extraordinary 1 258 119
public 1 258 119
service. 1 258 119

I 0 258 120
was 0 258 120
reading 0 258 120
just 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
other 0 258 120
day 0 258 120
a 0 258 120
2006 0 258 120
WikiLeaks 0 258 120
cable 0 258 120
from 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
U.S. 0 258 120
embassy 0 258 120
in 0 258 120
Caracas 0 258 120
which 0 258 120
was 0 258 120
addressed 0 258 120
to 0 258 120
other 0 258 120
agencies 0 258 120
in 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
region. 0 258 120

This 0 258 121
was 0 258 121
four 0 258 121
years 0 258 121
after 0 258 121
the 0 258 121
U.S. 0 258 121
tried 0 258 121
to 0 258 121
get 0 258 121
rid 0 258 121
of 0 258 121
Chavez 0 258 121
in 0 258 121
a 0 258 121
coup. 0 258 121

It 0 258 122
detailed 0 258 122
how 0 258 122
subversion 0 258 122
should 0 258 122
work. 0 258 122

Of 0 258 123
course, 0 258 123
they 1 258 123
dressed 1 258 123
it 1 258 123
up 1 258 123
as 0 258 123
human 0 258 123
rights 0 258 123
work 0 258 123
and 0 258 123
so 0 258 123
on. 0 258 123

I 0 258 124
was 0 258 124
reading 0 258 124
this 0 258 124
official 0 258 124
document 0 258 124
thinking 0 258 124
how 0 258 124
the 0 258 124
information 0 258 124
contained 0 258 124
in 0 258 124
it 0 258 124
was 0 258 124
worth 0 258 124
years 0 258 124
of 0 258 124
the 0 258 124
kind 0 258 124
of 0 258 124
distorted 0 258 124
reporting 0 258 124
from 0 258 124
Venezuela. 0 258 124

It 0 258 125
also 0 258 125
reminds 0 258 125
us 0 258 125
that 0 258 125
so-called 0 258 125
“meddling” 0 258 125
by 0 258 125
Russia 0 258 125
in 0 258 125
the 0 258 125
U.S. 0 258 125
is 0 258 125
just 0 258 125
nonsense. 0 258 125

The 0 258 126
word 0 258 126
“meddling” 0 258 126
doesn’t 0 258 126
apply 0 258 126
to 0 258 126
the 0 258 126
kind 0 258 126
of 0 258 126
action 0 258 126
implied 0 258 126
in 0 258 126
this 0 258 126
document. 0 258 126

It 0 258 127
is 0 258 127
intervention 0 258 127
in 0 258 127
another 0 258 127
country’s 0 258 127
affairs. 0 258 127

WikiLeaks 0 258 128
has 0 258 128
done 0 258 128
that 0 258 128
all 0 258 128
over 0 258 128
the 0 258 128
world. 0 258 128

It 0 258 129
has 0 258 129
given 0 258 129
people 0 258 129
the 0 258 129
information 0 258 129
they 0 258 129
have 0 258 129
a 0 258 129
right 0 258 129
to 0 258 129
have. 0 258 129

They 0 258 130
had 0 258 130
a 0 258 130
right 0 258 130
to 0 258 130
find 0 258 130
out 0 258 130
from 0 258 130
the 0 258 130
so-called 0 258 130
“War 0 258 130
Logs” 0 258 130
the 0 258 130
criminality 0 258 130
of 0 258 130
our 0 258 130
wars 0 258 130
in 0 258 130
Afghanistan 0 258 130
and 0 258 130
Iraq. 0 258 130

They 1 258 131
had 1 258 131
a 1 258 131
right 1 258 131
to 0 258 131
find 0 258 131
out 0 258 131
about 0 258 131
Cablegate. 0 258 131

That’s 0 258 132
when, 0 258 132
on 0 258 132
Clinton’s 0 258 132
watch, 0 258 132
we 0 258 132
learned 0 258 132
that 0 258 132
the 0 258 132
NSA 0 258 132
was 0 258 132
gathering 0 258 132
personal 0 258 132
information 0 258 132
on 0 258 132
members 0 258 132
of 0 258 132
the 0 258 132
United 0 258 132
Nations 0 258 132
Security 0 258 132
Council, 0 258 132
including 0 258 132
their 0 258 132
credit 0 258 132
card 0 258 132
numbers. 0 258 132

You 0 258 133
can 0 258 133
see 0 258 133
why 0 258 133
Julian 0 258 133
made 0 258 133
enemies. 0 258 133

But 0 258 134
he 0 258 134
should 0 258 134
also 0 258 134
have 0 258 134
made 0 258 134
a 0 258 134
huge 0 258 134
number 0 258 134
of 0 258 134
friends. 0 258 134

This 0 258 135
is 0 258 135
critical 0 258 135
information 0 258 135
because 0 258 135
it 0 258 135
tells 0 258 135
us 0 258 135
how 0 258 135
power 0 258 135
works 0 258 135
and 0 258 135
we 0 258 135
will 0 258 135
never 0 258 135
learn 0 258 135
about 0 258 135
it 0 258 135
otherwise. 0 258 135

I 0 258 136
think 0 258 136
WikiLeaks 0 258 136
has 0 258 136
opened 0 258 136
a 0 258 136
world 0 258 136
of 0 258 136
transparency 0 258 136
and 1 258 136
put 1 258 136
flesh 1 258 136
on 1 258 136
the 1 258 136
expression 1 258 136
“right 0 258 136
to 0 258 136
know.” 0 258 136
This 0 258 136
must 0 258 136
explain 0 258 136
why 0 258 136
he 0 258 136
is 0 258 136
attacked 0 258 136
so 0 258 136
much, 0 258 136
because 0 258 136
that 0 258 136
is 0 258 136
so 0 258 136
threatening. 0 258 136

The 1 258 137
enemy 1 258 137
to 1 258 137
great 1 258 137
power 1 258 137
is 1 258 137
not 1 258 137
the 1 258 137
likes 1 258 137
of 1 258 137
the 1 258 137
Taliban, 1 258 137
it 1 258 137
is 1 258 137
us. 1 258 137

DB: 0 258 138
And 0 258 138
who 0 258 138
can 0 258 138
forget 0 258 138
the 0 258 138
release 0 258 138
of 0 258 138
the 0 258 138
“collateral 0 258 138
murder” 0 258 138
footage 0 258 138
by 0 258 138
Chelsea 0 258 138
Manning? 0 258 138

JP: 0 258 139
That 0 258 139
kind 0 258 139
of 0 258 139
thing 0 258 139
is 0 258 139
not 0 258 139
uncommon. 0 258 139

Vietnam 0 258 140
was 0 258 140
meant 0 258 140
to 0 258 140
be 0 258 140
the 0 258 140
open 0 258 140
war 0 258 140
but 0 258 140
really 0 258 140
it 0 258 140
wasn’t. 0 258 140

There 0 258 141
weren’t 0 258 141
the 0 258 141
cameras 0 258 141
around. 0 258 141

It 0 258 142
is 0 258 142
indeed 0 258 142
shocking 1 258 142
information 1 258 142
but 0 258 142
it 0 258 142
informs 0 258 142
people, 0 258 142
and 0 258 142
we 0 258 142
have 0 258 142
Chelsea 0 258 142
Manning’s 0 258 142
courage 0 258 142
to 0 258 142
thank 0 258 142
for 0 258 142
that. 0 258 142

DB: 0 258 143
Yes, 0 258 143
and 0 258 143
the 0 258 143
thanks 0 258 143
he 0 258 143
got 0 258 143
was 0 258 143
seven 0 258 143
years 0 258 143
in 0 258 143
solitary 0 258 143
confinement. 0 258 143

They 0 258 144
want 0 258 144
to 0 258 144
prosecute 0 258 144
Assange 0 258 144
and 0 258 144
maybe 0 258 144
hang 1 258 144
him 1 258 144
from 1 258 144
the 1 258 144
rafters 1 258 144
in 0 258 144

is 0 258 145
no 0 258 145
