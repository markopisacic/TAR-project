A 0
source 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
timing 0
of 0
the 0
declassification 0
told 0
Fox 0

they 0
expected 0
the 0

to 0
be 0
declassified 0
first, 0
followed 0
by 0
the 0

on 0

The 0

added 0
that 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
is 0
working 0
on 0
a 0
"compressed 0
timeline" 0
and 0
they 0
expect 0
the 0
first 0
release 0
of 0
records 0
in 0
days 0
or 0
sooner. 0

The 0
text 0
messages 0
are 0
expected 0
to 0
take 0
longer 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
sheer 1
number 1
involved 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Trump 0
ordered 0
their 0
release 0
without 0
redactions. 0

on 0
Capitol 0

Intelligence 0
Committee 0
Chairman 0
Devin 0
Nunes, 0
R-Calif., 0
are 1
touting 1
the 1
president’s 1
order, 1
saying 0
it 0
covers 0
“pretty 0
much 0
everything 0
that 0
he 0
wanted…and 0
the 0
text 0
messages 0
are 0
a 0
bonus,” 0
a 0

Congressional 0

Republicans 0
are 0
hoping 0
the 0

reveal 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
led 0
by 0
the 0

which 0
evolved 0
into 0

investigation 0
into 0

and 0
potential 0
collusion 0
with 0

during 0

But 0

Democrats,including 0
the 0
committee’s 0
ranking 0
member, 0
Rep. 0
Adam 0
Schiff, 0
D-Calif., 0
are 1
blasting 1
the 0
declassification 0
order 0
as 0
a 0
“clear 1
abuse 1
of 1
power.” 1

"[Trump] 1

has 1
decided 1
to 1
intervene 1
in 1
a 1
pending 1
law 1
enforcement 1
investigation 1
by 1
ordering 1
the 1
selective 1
release 1
of 1
materials 1
he 1
believes 1
are 1
helpful 1
to 1
his 1
defense 1
team 1
and 1
thinks 1
will 1
advance 1
a 1
false 1
narrative," 1
Schiff 0
said. 0

"With 0
respect 0
to 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
materials, 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
previously 0
informed 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
consider 0
their 0
release 0
a 1
red 1
line 1
that 1
must 1
not 1
be 1
crossed 1
as 0
they 0
may 0
compromise 0
sources 0
and 0
methods. 0

"This 1

is 1
evidently 1
of 1
no 1
consequence 1
to 1
a 1
President 1
who 1
cares 1
about 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
country 1
and 1
everything 1
about 1
his 1
narrow 1
self-interest," 1
Schiff 0
added. 0

The 0

president’s 0
order 0
is 0
similar 0
to 0
his 0
February 0
move, 0
when 0
he 0
cleared 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
Republican-led 0
House 0
Intelligence 0
Committee 0
to 0
release 0
a 1
partisan 1
memo 1
about 0
the 0
surveillance 0
warrant 0
on 0
Carter 0
