that 0 429 43
Florida 0 429 43

provided 0 429 44
staffers 0 429 44
with 0 429 44
copies 0 429 44
of 0 429 44
a 0 429 44
form, 0 429 44
known 0 429 44
as 0 429 44
a 0 429 44
“cure 0 429 44
affidavit,” 0 429 44
that 0 429 44

We 0 429 45
also 0 429 45
know 0 429 45
that 0 429 45
a 0 429 45
Broward 0 429 45
County 0 429 45
employee, 0 429 45
Chelsey 0 429 45
Smith, 0 429 45
signed 0 429 45
an 0 429 45
affidavit 0 429 45
affirming 0 429 45
that 0 429 45
she 0 429 45
had 0 429 45
seen 0 429 45
members 0 429 45
of 0 429 45
Snipes' 0 429 45
staff 0 429 45
engaging 0 429 45
in 0 429 45
voter 0 429 45
fraud. 0 429 45

She 1 429 46
ignored 1 429 46
a 1 429 46
court 1 429 46
order, 1 429 46
mixed 1 429 46
invalid 1 429 46
provisional 1 429 46
ballots 1 429 46
in 1 429 46
with 1 429 46
valid 1 429 46
ones, 1 429 46
and 1 429 46
destroyed 1 429 46
ballots, 1 429 46
but 1 429 46
don't 1 429 46
worry, 1 429 46
a 1 429 46
Democrat 1 429 46
attorney 1 429 46
says 1 429 46
that 1 429 46
doing 1 429 46
so 1 429 46
has 1 429 46
nothing 1 429 46
to 1 429 46
do 1 429 46
with 1 429 46
fraud 1 429 46
or 1 429 46
corruption. 1 429 46

Now 1 429 47
that 1 429 47
federal 1 429 47
prosecutors 1 429 47
have 1 429 47
gotten 1 429 47
involved, 1 429 47
perhaps 1 429 47
it's 1 429 47
time 1 429 47
to 1 429 47
quit 1 429 47
talking 1 429 47
about 1 429 47
it 1 429 47
and 1 429 47
actually 1 429 47
arrest 1 429 47
this 1 429 47
woman 1 429 47
and 1 429 47
charge 1 429 47
her 1 429 47
with 1 429 47
crimes 1 429 47

the 1 429 47

up 1 429 47
dead 1 429 47
in 1 429 47
Broward 1 429 47
