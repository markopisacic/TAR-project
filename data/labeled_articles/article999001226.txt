But 0
an 0
email 0
obtained 0
by 0
the 0
USA 0
TODAY 0
NETWORK 0
– 0
Florida 0
shows 0
that 0
Florida 0
Democrats 0
were 0
organizing 0
a 0
broader 0
statewide 0
effort 0
beyond 0
those 0
counties 0
to 0
give 0

the 0
altered 0
forms 0
to 0
fix 0
improper 0
absentee 0
ballots 0
after 0
the 0
Nov. 0
5 0
deadline. 0

Democratic 0
party 0
leaders 0
provided 0
staffers 0
with 0
copies 0
of 0
a 0
form, 0
known 0
as 0
a 0
“cure 0
affidavit,” 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
modified 0
to 0
include 0
an 0
inaccurate 0
Nov. 0
8 0
deadline. 0

We 0
also 0
know 0
that 0
a 0
Broward 0
County 0
employee, 0
Chelsey 0
Smith, 0
signed 0
an 0
affidavit 0
affirming 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
seen 0
members 0
of 0
Snipes' 0
staff 0
engaging 0
in 0
voter 0
fraud. 0

She 1
ignored 1
a 1
court 1
order, 1
mixed 1
invalid 1
provisional 1
ballots 1
in 1
with 1
valid 1
ones, 1
and 1
destroyed 1
ballots, 1
but 1
don't 1
worry, 1
a 1
Democrat 1
attorney 1
says 1
that 1
doing 1
so 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
fraud 1
or 1
corruption. 1

Now 1
that 1
federal 1
prosecutors 1
have 1
gotten 1
involved, 1
perhaps 1
it's 1
time 1
to 1
quit 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
actually 1
arrest 1
this 1
woman 1
and 1
charge 1
her 1
with 1
crimes 1
against 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
Broward 1
County 1
before 1
more 1
people 1
end 1
up 1
dead 1
in 1
Broward 1
County 1
over 1
their 1
corrupt 1
voting 1
practices. 1
