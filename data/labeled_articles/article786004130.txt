Preliminary 0 80 14
information 0 80 14
suggests 0 80 14
that 0 80 14
the 0 80 14
officer 0 80 14
arrived 0 80 14
home 0 80 14
in 0 80 14

after 0 80 14
working 0 80 14
a 0 80 14
full 0 80 14
shift. 0 80 14

The 0 80 15
officer 0 80 15
reported 0 80 15
to 0 80 15
the 0 80 15
responding 0 80 15

that 0 80 15
she 0 80 15

At 0 80 16
some 0 80 16

the 0 80 16

fired 0 80 16
her 0 80 16

striking 0 80 16
the 0 80 16
victim. 0 80 16

a 0 80 17
26-year-old 0 80 17
male, 0 80 17
at 0 80 17
the 0 80 17
scene. 0 80 17

The 0 80 18
victim 0 80 18
was 0 80 18
then 0 80 18
transported 0 80 18
to 0 80 18

The 0 80 25

Jean, 0 80 26
who 0 80 26
lived 0 80 26
on 0 80 26
the 0 80 26
fourth 0 80 26
floor 0 80 26

the 0 80 26
Cedars, 0 80 26
was 0 80 26
home 0 80 26
alone 0 80 26
when 0 80 26
Guyger 0 80 26
mistook 0 80 26
his 0 80 26
apartment 0 80 26
for 0 80 26
hers, 0 80 26
the 1 80 26
affidavit 1 80 26
says. 1 80 26

Guyger 0 80 27
lived 0 80 27
on 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
third 0 80 27
floor, 0 80 27
directly 0 80 27
beneath 0 80 27
his 0 80 27
apartment, 0 80 27
and 0 80 27
mistakenly 0 80 27
parked 0 80 27
on 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
fourth 0 80 27
floor 0 80 27
after 0 80 27
finishing 0 80 27
a 0 80 27
shift 0 80 27
at 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
Dallas 0 80 27
Police 0 80 27
Department, 0 80 27
the 1 80 27
affidavit 1 80 27
says. 1 80 27

When 0 80 28
she 0 80 28
arrived 0 80 28
at 0 80 28
Jean's 0 80 28
door, 0 80 28
Guyger 0 80 28
entered 0 80 28
a 0 80 28
unique 0 80 28
door 0 80 28
key 0 80 28
with 0 80 28
an 0 80 28
electronic 0 80 28
chip 0 80 28
into 0 80 28
the 0 80 28
keyhole, 0 80 28
the 1 80 28
affidavit 1 80 28
says. 1 80 28

The 0 80 29
door 0 80 29
was 0 80 29
already 0 80 29
ajar, 0 80 29
so 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
force 0 80 29
of 0 80 29
pushing 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
key 0 80 29
inside 0 80 29
opened 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
door, 0 80 29
according 0 80 29
to 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
affidavit. 0 80 29

The 1 80 30
affidavit 1 80 30
says 1 80 30
the 0 80 30
apartments' 0 80 30
"respective 0 80 30
interior 0 80 30
floorplans 0 80 30
are 0 80 30
in 0 80 30
most 0 80 30
ways 0 80 30
identical 0 80 30
or 0 80 30
extremely 0 80 30
similar." 0 80 30

The 0 80 31
apartment 0 80 31
was 0 80 31
dark 0 80 31
and 0 80 31
when 0 80 31
she 0 80 31
saw 0 80 31
"a 0 80 31
large 0 80 31
silhouette," 0 80 31
Guyger 0 80 31
thought 0 80 31
she 0 80 31
was 0 80 31
being 0 80 31
burglarized, 0 80 31
the 1 80 31
affidavit 1 80 31
says. 1 80 31

The 1 80 32
affidavit 1 80 32
says 1 80 32
Guyger 0 80 32
drew 0 80 32
her 0 80 32
gun, 0 80 32
"gave 0 80 32
verbal 0 80 32
commands 0 80 32
that 0 80 32
were 0 80 32
ignored" 0 80 32
and 0 80 32
fired 0 80 32
twice. 0 80 32

Jean 0 80 33
was 0 80 33
struck 0 80 33
once 0 80 33
in 0 80 33
the 0 80 33
torso. 0 80 33

Guyger 0 80 34
then 0 80 34
called 0 80 34
911 0 80 34
from 0 80 34
her 0 80 34
cellphone 0 80 34
and 0 80 34
started 0 80 34
performing 0 80 34
first 0 80 34
aid. 0 80 34

She 0 80 35
turned 0 80 35
on 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
lights, 0 80 35
then 0 80 35
went 0 80 35
to 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
front 0 80 35
door 0 80 35
again 0 80 35
and 0 80 35
realized 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
apartment 0 80 35
wasn't 0 80 35
hers, 0 80 35
the 1 80 35
affidavit 1 80 35
says. 1 80 35

She 0 80 36
told 0 80 36
the 0 80 36
911 0 80 36
operator 0 80 36
as 0 80 36
well 0 80 36
as 0 80 36
responding 0 80 36
officers 0 80 36
that 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
thought 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
was 0 80 36
at 0 80 36
her 0 80 36
apartment 0 80 36
when 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
shot 0 80 36
Jean, 0 80 36
according 1 80 36
to 1 80 36
the 1 80 36
affidavit. 1 80 36

Ok, 0 80 37
some 0 80 37
of 0 80 37
this 0 80 37
seems 0 80 37
plausible, 0 80 37
but 0 80 37
I 0 80 37
still 0 80 37
am 0 80 37
left 0 80 37
wondering 0 80 37
about 0 80 37
the 0 80 37
door 0 80 37
being 0 80 37
ajar. 0 80 37

Is 0 80 38
this 0 80 38
something 0 80 38
people 0 80 38
are 0 80 38
prone 0 80 38
to 0 80 38
do 0 80 38
at 0 80 38
1o 0 80 38
o'clock 0 80 38
at 0 80 38
night 0 80 38
in 0 80 38
Dallas? 0 80 38

In 0 80 39
any 0 80 39
case, 0 80 39
we 0 80 39
all 0 80 39
know 0 80 39
that 0 80 39
any 0 80 39
of 0 80 39
us 0 80 39
who 0 80 39
did 0 80 39
the 0 80 39
same 0 80 39
thing 0 80 39
would 0 80 39
have 0 80 39
immediately 0 80 39
been 0 80 39
taken 0 80 39
into 0 80 39
custody. 0 80 39

This 0 80 40
was 0 80 40
not 0 80 40
the 0 80 40
case 0 80 40
with 0 80 40
Guyger, 0 80 40
though 0 80 40
one 0 80 40
officer 0 80 40
close 0 80 40
to 0 80 40
her 0 80 40
said, 0 80 40
"she 0 80 40
is 0 80 40
devastated." 0 80 40

Knowing 0 80 41
this 0 80 41
provoked 0 80 41
outrage 0 80 41
across 0 80 41
the 0 80 41
nation 0 80 41
over 0 80 41
the 0 80 41
weekend. 0 80 41

In 0 80 42
fact, 0 80 42
this 0 80 42
is 0 80 42
not 0 80 42
her 0 80 42
first 0 80 42
shooting. 0 80 42

As 0 80 43
a 0 80 43
four-year 0 80 43
veteran 0 80 43
of 0 80 43
the 0 80 43
force, 0 80 43
she 0 80 43
was 0 80 43
also 0 80 43
involved 0 80 43
in 0 80 43
the 0 80 43
shooting 0 80 43
of 0 80 43
another 0 80 43

In 0 80 45
2017, 0 80 45
Guyger 0 80 45

47-year-old 0 80 45
Uvaldo 0 80 45
Perez, 0 80 45
