that 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
Mueller 0
has 0
submitted 0
his 0
report 0
to 0
the 0

any 0

of 0

The 0
Democratic 0
leaders 0
said 0
Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
“focused 0
on 0
questions 0
that 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
our 1
democracy 1
itself: 0
whether 0
foreign 0
powers 0
corruptly 0
interfered 0
in 0
our 0
elections, 0
and 0
whether 0
unlawful 0
means 0
were 0
used 0
to 0
hinder 0
that 0
investigation.” 0

“The 1
American 1
people 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
the 1
truth. 1

The 0
watchword 0
is 0
transparency,” 0
they 0
said. 0

Trump 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
he 0
also 0
wants 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
full 0
report 0
released. 0

“Let 1
it 1
come 1
out. 1

Let 1

No 0
collusion 0

Mueller’s 0
investigation, 0
which 0
began 0
nearly 0
two 0
years 0
ago, 0
has 0
resulted 0
in 0
200 0
charges 0
against 0
34 0
people 0
and 0
three 0
Russian 0
companies. 0

Six 0
former 0
Trump 0
advisers 0
have 0
been 0
indicted 0
for 0
process 0
crimes, 0
including 0
perjury. 0

However, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
no 0
indictments 0
related 0
to 0
alleged 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
collusion 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Trump 0
has 0
insisted 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
that 0
the 0
probe 0
is 0
a 0
“witch 1
hunt.” 1

Rep. 0
Mark 0
Meadows, 0
R-N.C., 0
who 0
has 0
investigated 0
Russian 0
interference 0
as 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
House 0
Oversight 0
and 0
Government 0
Reform 0
Committee, 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
critic 0
of 0
the 0
Mueller 0
probe. 0

‏ 0

“The 0
Mueller 0
report 0
delivery 0
suggests 0
no 0
more 0
indictments 0
are 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel. 0

If 0
that’s 0
true, 0
it 0
would 0
mean 0
we 0
just 0
completed 0
2 0
years 0
of 0
investigating 0
‘Russian 0
collusion’ 0
without 0
ONE 1
collusion 0
related 0
indictment. 0

Not 1
even 1
one,” 1
he 0
wrote 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“Why? 0

Because 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
collusion.” 0
