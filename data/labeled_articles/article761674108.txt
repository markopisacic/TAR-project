on 0 73 4
the 0 73 4
GOP 0 73 4
establishment 0 73 4
in 0 73 4
the 0 73 4

Civil 0 73 4

Act 0 73 4
of 0 73 4
1964, 0 73 4
defiantly 0 73 4
declared, 0 73 4
"Extremism 1 73 4
in 1 73 4

The 0 73 5

"Mr. 1 73 5

was 0 73 5
a 0 73 5
true 0 73 5

With 0 73 7
Falstaff, 0 73 7
Flake 0 73 7
appears 0 73 7
to 0 73 7
believe 0 73 7
that 0 73 7
"discretion 1 73 7
is 1 73 7
the 1 73 7
better 1 73 7
part 1 73 7
of 1 73 7

another 0 73 8

fight 0 73 8
Trump 0 73 8
while 1 73 8
he 1 73 8
retires 1 73 8
to 1 73 8
Tennessee. 1 73 8

It's 0 73 9
no 0 73 9
wonder 0 73 9
the 0 73 9
establishment 0 73 9
is 0 73 9
viewed 0 73 9
with 0 73 9
such 0 73 9
derision. 1 73 9

Flake 0 73 10
calls 0 73 10
Trump 0 73 10
"dangerous 1 73 10
to 1 73 10
our 1 73 10
democracy." 1 73 10

But 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
real 0 73 11
threat 0 73 11
Trump 0 73 11
represents 0 73 11
is 0 73 11
to 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
GOP 0 73 11
establishment's 0 73 11
control 0 73 11
of 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
party's 0 73 11
agenda 0 73 11
and 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
party's 0 73 11
destiny. 0 73 11

U.S. 0 73 12
politics 0 73 12
have 0 73 12
indeed 0 73 12
been 0 73 12
coarsened, 0 73 12
with 0 73 12
Trump 0 73 12
playing 0 73 12
a 0 73 12
lead 0 73 12
role. 0 73 12

Yet, 0 73 13
beneath 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
savagery 1 73 13
of 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
uncivil 0 73 13
war 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
party 0 73 13
lies 0 73 13
more 0 73 13
than 0 73 13
personal 0 73 13
insults 0 73 13
and 0 73 13
personality 0 73 13
clashes. 0 73 13

This 0 73 14
is 0 73 14
a 0 73 14
struggle 0 73 14
about 0 73 14
policy, 0 73 14
about 1 73 14
the 1 73 14
future. 1 73 14

And 0 73 15
Trump 1 73 15
is 1 73 15
president 1 73 15
because 1 73 15
he 1 73 15
read 1 73 15
the 1 73 15
party 1 73 15
and 1 73 15
the 1 73 15
country 1 73 15
right, 1 73 15
while 0 73 15
the 0 73 15
Bush-McCain 0 73 15
Republican 0 73 15
establishment 0 73 15
had 0 73 15

still, 0 73 24
the 0 73 24

Yesterday's 0 73 33
New 0 73 33
York 0 73 33
Times 0 73 33
recognized 0 73 33
Trump's 0 73 33
triumph: 1 73 33

"Despite 0 73 34
the 0 73 34
fervor 0 73 34
of 0 73 34
President 0 73 34
Trump's 0 73 34
Republican 0 73 34
opponents, 0 73 34
the 0 73 34
president's 0 73 34
brand 0 73 34
of 0 73 34
hard-edged 1 73 34
nationalism—with 0 73 34
its 0 73 34
gut-level 1 73 34
cultural 0 73 34
appeals 0 73 34
and 0 73 34
hard 0 73 34

on 0 73 34

taking 0 73 34
root 0 73 34
within 0 73 34
his 0 73 34
adopted 0 73 34
party." 0 73 34

Moreover, 0 73 35
a 0 73 35
new 0 73 35
question 0 73 35
arises: 0 73 35

Can 0 73 36
the 0 73 36
GOP 0 73 36
establishment 0 73 36
believe 0 73 36
that 0 73 36
if 0 73 36
Trump 0 73 36
falls, 0 73 36
or 0 73 36
they 0 73 36
bring 0 73 36
him 0 73 36
down, 0 73 36
they 0 73 36
will 0 73 36
inherit 0 73 36
the 0 73 36
estate 0 73 36
and 0 73 36
be 0 73 36
welcomed 0 73 36
home 0 73 36
like 0 73 36
the 0 73 36
Prodigal 1 73 36
Son? 1 73 36

Do 1 73 37
they 1 73 37
believe 1 73 37
their 1 73 37
old 1 73 37
agenda 1 73 37
of 1 73 37
open 1 73 37
borders, 1 73 37
amnesty, 1 73 37
free 1 73 37
trade 1 73 37
globalism 1 73 37
and 1 73 37
democracy-crusading 1 73 37
can 1 73 37
become 1 73 37
America's 1 73 37
agenda 1 73 37
again? 1 73 37

Trumpism 1 73 38
is 0 73 38
not 0 73 38
a 0 73 38
detour, 0 73 38
after 0 73 38
which 0 73 38
we 0 73 38
can 0 73 38
all 0 73 38
get 0 73 38
back 0 73 38

For 0 73 39
though 0 73 39
unpleasant, 0 73 39
it 0 73 39
is 0 73 39
not 0 73 39
unfair 0 73 39
to 0 73 39
say 0 73 39
that 0 73 39
if 0 73 39
there 0 73 39
was 0 73 39
one 0 73 39
