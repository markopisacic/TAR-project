Hungarian 0 280 1
Prime 0 280 1
Minister 0 280 1
Viktor 0 280 1
Orban 0 280 1
doesn't 0 280 1
mince 0 280 1
words 0 280 1
when 0 280 1
it 0 280 1
comes 0 280 1
to 0 280 1
the 0 280 1
Muslim 1 280 1
invasion 1 280 1
in 0 280 1
Europe 0 280 1
and 0 280 1
specifically 0 280 1
to 0 280 1
his 0 280 1
own 0 280 1
country. 0 280 1

Orban 0 280 2
says 0 280 2
there 0 280 2
is 0 280 2
not 0 280 2
only 0 280 2
Muslim 1 280 2
invaders 1 280 2
in 0 280 2
the 0 280 2
mix 0 280 2
of 0 280 2
"refugees," 0 280 2
but 0 280 2
also 0 280 2
“economic 0 280 2

seeking 0 280 2
better 0 280 2
lives 0 280 2
for 0 280 2
themselves. 0 280 2

Indeed, 0 280 3
both 0 280 3
of 0 280 3
these 0 280 3
are 0 280 3
true. 0 280 3

There 0 280 4
are 0 280 4
plenty 0 280 4
of 0 280 4
these 0 280 4
people 0 280 4
who 0 280 4
are 0 280 4
simply 0 280 4
happy 0 280 4
to 0 280 4
have 0 280 4
a 0 280 4
place 0 280 4
to 0 280 4
live 0 280 4
after 0 280 4
many 0 280 4
were 0 280 4
driven 0 280 4
from 0 280 4
their 0 280 4
homes 0 280 4
due 0 280 4
to 0 280 4
the 0 280 4
US, 0 280 4
Russia 0 280 4
and 0 280 4
other 0 280 4
countries 0 280 4
putting 1 280 4
their 1 280 4
noses 1 280 4
where 0 280 4
they 0 280 4
didn't 0 280 4
belong 0 280 4
and 0 280 4
funding, 0 280 4

and 0 280 4
arming 0 280 4
Islamic 0 280 4
jihadis 0 280 4
there. 0 280 4

Then, 0 280 5
there 0 280 5
are 0 280 5
those 0 280 5
who 0 280 5
clearly 0 280 5
come 0 280 5

Viktor 0 280 7
Orban 0 280 7
has 0 280 7

adding 0 280 7
that 0 280 7
the 0 280 7

of 0 280 7

Asked 0 280 7
in 0 280 7
an 0 280 7

with 0 280 7
the 0 280 7
German 0 280 7
Bild 0 280 7
newspaper 0 280 7
why 0 280 7
Budapest 0 280 7
does 0 280 7
not 0 280 7
want 0 280 7
to 0 280 7
accept 0 280 7
any 0 280 7
refugees, 0 280 7
Orban 0 280 7
replied: 0 280 7
“We 0 280 7
don’t 0 280 7
consider 0 280 7
these 0 280 7
people 0 280 7
to 0 280 7
be 0 280 7
Muslim 0 280 7
refugees.” 0 280 7
Instead, 0 280 7
the 0 280 7
tough-talking 0 280 7
politician 0 280 7
said 0 280 7
they 0 280 7
were 0 280 7
regarded 0 280 7
as 0 280 7
“Muslim 1 280 7
invaders.” 1 280 7
Asylum 0 280 7
seekers 0 280 7
must 0 280 7
cross 0 280 7
four 0 280 7
countries 0 280 7
to 0 280 7
reach 0 280 7
Hungary 0 280 7
from 0 280 7
Syria, 0 280 7
all 0 280 7
of 0 280 7
which 0 280 7
are 0 280 7
not 0 280 7
as 0 280 7
rich 0 280 7
as 0 280 7
Germany 0 280 7
but 0 280 7
are 0 280 7
economically 0 280 7
stable, 0 280 7
the 0 280 7
PM 0 280 7
said. 0 280 7

He 0 280 8
was 0 280 8
apparently 0 280 8
referring 0 280 8
to 0 280 8
Turkey, 0 280 8
Greece, 0 280 8
Macedonia 0 280 8
and 0 280 8
Serbia 0 280 8
– 0 280 8
a 0 280 8
common 0 280 8
route 0 280 8
for 0 280 8
migrants 0 280 8
heading 0 280 8
for 0 280 8
‘wealthy’ 0 280 8
Europe. 0 280 8

“So, 0 280 9
they 0 280 9
are 0 280 9
not 0 280 9
running 0 280 9
for 0 280 9
their 0 280 9
lives 0 280 9
[in 0 280 9
these 0 280 9
countries]. 0 280 9

They 0 280 10
are 0 280 10
merely 0 280 10
economic 0 280 10
migrants 0 280 10
seeking 0 280 10
a 0 280 10
better 0 280 10
life,” 0 280 10
Orban 0 280 10
concluded. 0 280 10

He 0 280 11
stressed 0 280 11
though, 0 280 11
that 0 280 11
he 0 280 11
can 0 280 11
only 0 280 11
speak 0 280 11
for 0 280 11
the 0 280 11
Hungarians 0 280 11
and 0 280 11
they 1 280 11
“don’t 1 280 11
want” 1 280 11
immigration. 1 280 11

In 0 280 12
his 0 280 12
view, 0 280 12
the 0 280 12
government 0 280 12
simply 0 280 12
can’t 0 280 12
go 0 280 12
against 0 280 12
the 0 280 12
will 0 280 12
of 0 280 12
the 0 280 12
people. 0 280 12

And 0 280 13
Orban 0 280 13
has 0 280 13
stayed 0 280 13
the 0 280 13
course, 0 280 13
too 0 280 13
while 0 280 13
governments 0 280 13
like 0 280 13
that 0 280 13
of 0 280 13
Germany 0 280 13
have 0 280 13
ignored 0 280 13
their 0 280 13
people 0 280 13
to 0 280 13
allow 0 280 13
for 0 280 13
a 0 280 13
clear 0 280 13
invasion 0 280 13
of 0 280 13
Germany 0 280 13
that 0 280 13
has 0 280 13
led 0 280 13
to 0 280 13
untold 1 280 13
numbers 1 280 13
of 0 280 13
sexual 1 280 13
assaults 1 280 13
by 1 280 13
Muslim 1 280 13
migrants, 1 280 13
attacks 1 280 13
on 1 280 13
Christians 1 280 13
and 1 280 13
there's 1 280 13
no 1 280 13
telling 1 280 13
the 1 280 13
amount 1 280 13
of 1 280 13
damage 1 280 13
to 1 280 13
the 1 280 13
unethical 1 280 13
welfare 1 280 13
system 1 280 13
in 1 280 13
the 1 280 13
country. 1 280 13

RT 0 280 14
continues: 0 280 14

Going 0 280 15
further, 0 280 15
the 0 280 15
prime 0 280 15
minister 0 280 15
noted 0 280 15
that 0 280 15
no 0 280 15
refugee 0 280 15
wants 0 280 15
to 0 280 15
go 0 280 15
to 0 280 15
Portugal, 0 280 15
for 0 280 15
example, 0 280 15
adding 0 280 15
that 0 280 15
the 0 280 15
majority 0 280 15
of 0 280 15
asylum 0 280 15
seekers 0 280 15
simply 0 280 15
wanted 0 280 15
to 0 280 15
live 0 280 15
in 0 280 15
prosperous 0 280 15
Germany. 0 280 15

“The 1 280 16
reason 1 280 16
why 1 280 16
people 1 280 16
are 1 280 16
in 1 280 16
your 1 280 16
country 1 280 16
is 1 280 16
not 1 280 16
because 1 280 16
they 1 280 16
are 1 280 16
refugees, 1 280 16
but 1 280 16
because 1 280 16
they 1 280 16
want 1 280 16
a 1 280 16
German 1 280 16
life,” 1 280 16
he 0 280 16
said, 0 280 16
describing 0 280 16
the 0 280 16
issue 0 280 16
“politically” 0 280 16
as 0 280 16
a 0 280 16
European 0 280 16
problem 0 280 16
but, 0 280 16
“sociologically,” 0 280 16
as 0 280 16
a 0 280 16
German 0 280 16
problem. 0 280 16

Orban 0 280 17
specifically 0 280 17
targeted 0 280 17
Germany 0 280 17
and 0 280 17
Chancellor 0 280 17
Angela 0 280 17
Merkel’s 0 280 17
‘open-door’ 0 280 17
policy 0 280 17
towards 0 280 17
asylum 0 280 17
seekers. 0 280 17

“I’ve 0 280 18
never 0 280 18
understood 0 280 18
how 0 280 18
chaos, 1 280 18
anarchy 1 280 18
and 1 280 18
illegal 1 280 18
border 1 280 18
crossings 1 280 18
are 0 280 18
viewed 0 280 18
as 0 280 18
something 0 280 18
good 0 280 18
in 0 280 18
a 0 280 18
country 0 280 18
like 0 280 18
Germany, 0 280 18
which 0 280 18
we 0 280 18
view 0 280 18
as 0 280 18
the 1 280 18
best 1 280 18
example 1 280 18
of 1 280 18
discipline 1 280 18
and 1 280 18
the 1 280 18
rule 1 280 18
of 1 280 18
law,” 1 280 18
he 0 280 18
said. 0 280 18

The 0 280 19
recent 0 280 19
wave 0 280 19
of 0 280 19
refugees 0 280 19
reaching 0 280 19
Europe 0 280 19
is 0 280 19
merely 0 280 19
an 0 280 19
invasion, 1 280 19
according 0 280 19
to 0 280 19
Orban. 0 280 19

“If 0 280 20
someone 0 280 20
wants 0 280 20
to 0 280 20
come 0 280 20
to 0 280 20
your 0 280 20
house, 0 280 20
he 0 280 20
knocks 0 280 20
on 0 280 20
your 0 280 20
door 0 280 20
and 0 280 20
asks: 0 280 20
‘Can 0 280 20
we 0 280 20
come 0 280 20
in, 0 280 20
can 0 280 20
we 0 280 20
stay?’ 0 280 20
They 0 280 20
[asylum 0 280 20
seekers] 0 280 20
didn’t 0 280 20
do 0 280 20
that, 0 280 20
they 0 280 20
crossed 0 280 20
the 0 280 20
border 0 280 20
illegally,” 0 280 20
he 0 280 20
stated. 0 280 20

Orban 0 280 21
then 0 280 21
did 0 280 21
what 0 280 21
most 0 280 21
political 0 280 21
representatives 0 280 21
will 0 280 21
simply 0 280 21
not 0 280 21
do, 0 280 21
he 0 280 21
told 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
truth 0 280 21
about 0 280 21
multiculturalism. 0 280 21

He 0 280 22
called 0 280 22
it 0 280 22
an 0 280 22
"illusion" 0 280 22
and 0 280 22
said 0 280 22
that 0 280 22
Christian 1 280 22
and 1 280 22
Muslim 1 280 22
societies 1 280 22
“will 1 280 22
never 1 280 22
unite.” 1 280 22

Of 0 280 23
course, 0 280 23
they 0 280 23
won't. 0 280 23

They 1 280 24
have 1 280 24
absolutely 1 280 24
nothing 1 280 24
in 1 280 24
common. 1 280 24

They 1 280 25
cannot 1 280 25
agree 1 280 25
on 1 280 25
God's 1 280 25
law, 1 280 25
which 1 280 25
most 1 280 25
Western 1 280 25
societies 1 280 25
were 1 280 25
base 1 280 25
on, 1 280 25
including 1 280 25
the 1 280 25
united 1 280 25
States. 1 280 25

They 1 280 26
cannot 1 280 26
agree 1 280 26
on 0 280 26
the 0 280 26
Scriptures. 0 280 26

They 1 280 27
cannot 1 280 27
agree 1 280 27
on 1 280 27
the 0 280 27
person 0 280 27
and 0 280 27
work 0 280 27
of 0 280 27
Jesus 0 280 27
the 0 280 27
Christ. 0 280 27

They 0 280 28
can't 0 280 28
even 0 280 28
agree 0 280 28
on 0 280 28
the 0 280 28
means 0 280 28
of 0 280 28
proselytizing 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
of 0 280 28
what 0 280 28
real 0 280 28
spiritual 0 280 28
weapons 0 280 28
are. 0 280 28

PM 0 280 29
Orban 0 280 29
has 0 280 29
remained 0 280 29
consistent. 0 280 29

He 0 280 30
has 0 280 30
publicly 0 280 30
told 0 280 30
the 0 280 30
Muslim 1 280 30
invaders 1 280 30
to 0 280 30
leave 1 280 30
Hungary 1 280 30
and 1 280 30
never 1 280 30
come 1 280 30
back. 1 280 30

He 0 280 31
has 0 280 31
rebuffed 0 280 31
Brussels, 0 280 31
which 0 280 31
is 0 280 31
largely 0 280 31
Islamic, 0 280 31
and 0 280 31
told 0 280 31
them 0 280 31
that 0 280 31
Hungary 1 280 31
would 1 280 31
defend 1 280 31
its 1 280 31
borders, 1 280 31
and 1 280 31
it 1 280 31
has. 1 280 31

Orban's 0 280 32
border 0 280 32
wall 0 280 32
reduced 0 280 32
illegal 0 280 32
immigration 0 280 32
by 0 280 32
99%! 0 280 32

He 1 280 33
has 1 280 33
genuinely 1 280 33
reached 1 280 33
out 1 280 33
his 1 280 33
hand 1 280 33

he 1 280 33

to 1 280 33
the 1 280 33

emulated 1 280 33
by 1 280 33
the 1 280 33
Protestant 1 280 33

Furthermore, 0 280 34
Orban 0 280 34
has 0 280 34
also 0 280 34

for 0 280 35
his 0 280 35

and 0 280 35
wrote, 0 280 35
"At 0 280 35
last, 0 280 35

the 0 280 35
Muslim 1 280 35

And 0 280 36
while 0 280 36
Orban 0 280 36
is 0 280 36
right 0 280 36
that 0 280 36
these 0 280 36
are 0 280 36
'economic 0 280 36

they 0 280 36

"Many, 1 280 38

They 1 280 39
are 1 280 39
