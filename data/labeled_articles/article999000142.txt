she 0
added. 0

“And 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
it’s 0
politically 0
correct 0
to 0
say 0
we 0
value 0
that," 0
she 0
concluded. 0

"And 0
I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
go 0
around 0
insulting 0
people. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
paint 0

a 0
broad 0
brush 0
every 0
immigrant 0
is 0
this, 0
every 0
African-American 0
is 0
that, 0
every, 0
you 0
know, 0
other 0
person 0
with 0
different 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
or 0
whatever 0
– 0
that’s 1
childish.” 1

Right, 0
except 0
she 0
does 0
just 0
that 0
and 0
so 0
do 0
many 0
in 0
her 0
party. 0

However, 0
in 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
minute 0
she 0
would 0
insult 0
both 0
Booker 0
and 0
Holder, 0
and 1
every 1
person 1
with 1
dark 1
skin 1
on 1
the 1
planet. 1

Swisher 0
asked 0
her, 0
"What 0
do 0
you 0
think 0
of 0
Cory 0
Booker… 0
saying 0
‘kick 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
shins,’ 1
essentially?" 0

Of 0
course, 0
Swisher 0
meant 0
Eric 0
Holder 0
and 0
Clinton 0
corrected 0
her, 0
adding, 0
“Yeah, 0
I 0
know 0
they 0
all 0
look 0
alike." 0

What 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
amazing 1
is 0
that 0
the 0
audience 0
laughed 0
hysterically. 0

Can 0
you 0
imagine 0
if 0
a 0
conservative 0
person 0
uttered 0
those 0
comments? 0

There 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
near 0
lynching 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
spot 0
and 0
surely 0
for 0
days 0
to 0
come. 0

They 0
might 0
lose 0
their 0
livelihood 0
and 0
get 0
death 0
threats, 0
but 0
not 0
"Crooked" 1
Hillary. 1

Clearly, 1
she 1
was 1
speaking 1
of 1
all 1
black 1
people 1
and 1
not 1
being 1
specific 1
to 1
Holder 1
or 1
Booker 1
as 1
they 1
look 1
nothing 1
alike. 1

The 0
only 0
thing 0
the 0
two 0
of 0
them 0
have 0
in 0
common 0
is 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
criminals 0
and 0
have 0
black 0
skin. 0

Clinton's 0
comments 0
were 0
clearly 0
racist, 0
and 0
those 0
fawning 0
over 0
her 0
during 0
the 0
interview 0
laughed 0
it 0
up 0
right 0
along 0
with 0
her. 0

Here, 0
take 0
a 0
look! 0

Disgusting 1
that 0
she 0
continues 0
to 0
move 0
and 0
speak 0
freely 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
with 0
no 0
justice 0
being 0
brought 0
to 0
bear 0
on 0
her 0
for 0
her 0
many 0
crimes, 0
something 0
we 0
were 0
promised 0
from 0
then-candidate 0
Trump. 0
