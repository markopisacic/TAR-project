Right, 0 405 23
except 0 405 23
she 0 405 23
does 0 405 23
just 0 405 23
that 0 405 23

so 0 405 23
do 0 405 23
many 0 405 23
in 0 405 23
her 0 405 23

However, 0 405 24
in 0 405 24
less 0 405 24
than 0 405 24
a 0 405 24
minute 0 405 24
she 0 405 24

Swisher 0 405 25
asked 0 405 25
her, 0 405 25
"What 0 405 25
do 0 405 25
you 0 405 25
think 0 405 25
of 0 405 25
Cory 0 405 25
Booker… 0 405 25
saying 0 405 25
‘kick 1 405 25
them 1 405 25
in 1 405 25
the 1 405 25
shins,’ 1 405 25
essentially?" 0 405 25

Of 0 405 26
course, 0 405 26
Swisher 0 405 26
meant 0 405 26
Eric 0 405 26
Holder 0 405 26
and 0 405 26
Clinton 0 405 26
corrected 0 405 26
her, 0 405 26
adding, 0 405 26
“Yeah, 0 405 26
I 0 405 26
know 0 405 26
they 0 405 26
all 0 405 26
look 0 405 26
alike." 0 405 26

What 1 405 27
was 1 405 27
even 1 405 27
more 1 405 27
amazing 1 405 27
is 0 405 27
that 0 405 27
the 0 405 27
audience 0 405 27
laughed 0 405 27
hysterically. 0 405 27

Can 0 405 28
you 0 405 28
imagine 0 405 28
if 0 405 28
a 0 405 28
conservative 0 405 28
person 0 405 28
uttered 0 405 28
those 0 405 28
comments? 0 405 28

There 0 405 29
would 0 405 29
be 0 405 29
a 0 405 29
near 0 405 29
lynching 0 405 29
of 0 405 29
them 0 405 29
on 0 405 29
the 0 405 29
spot 0 405 29
and 0 405 29
surely 0 405 29
for 0 405 29
days 0 405 29
to 0 405 29
come. 0 405 29

They 0 405 30
might 0 405 30
lose 0 405 30
their 0 405 30
livelihood 0 405 30
and 0 405 30
get 0 405 30
death 0 405 30
threats, 0 405 30
but 0 405 30
not 0 405 30
"Crooked" 1 405 30
Hillary. 1 405 30

Clearly, 1 405 31
she 1 405 31
was 1 405 31
speaking 1 405 31
of 1 405 31
all 1 405 31
black 1 405 31
people 1 405 31
and 1 405 31
not 1 405 31
being 1 405 31
specific 1 405 31
to 1 405 31
Holder 1 405 31
or 1 405 31
Booker 1 405 31
as 1 405 31
they 1 405 31
look 1 405 31
nothing 1 405 31
alike. 1 405 31

The 0 405 32
only 0 405 32
thing 0 405 32
the 0 405 32
two 0 405 32
of 0 405 32
them 0 405 32
have 0 405 32
in 0 405 32
common 0 405 32
is 0 405 32
that 0 405 32
they 0 405 32
are 0 405 32
criminals 0 405 32
and 0 405 32
have 0 405 32
black 0 405 32
skin. 0 405 32

Clinton's 0 405 33
comments 0 405 33
were 0 405 33
clearly 0 405 33
racist, 0 405 33
and 0 405 33
those 0 405 33
fawning 0 405 33
over 0 405 33
her 0 405 33
during 0 405 33
the 0 405 33
interview 0 405 33
laughed 0 405 33
it 0 405 33
up 0 405 33
right 0 405 33
along 0 405 33
with 0 405 33
her. 0 405 33

Here, 0 405 34
take 0 405 34
a 0 405 34
look! 0 405 34
