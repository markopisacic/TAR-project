that 0
he 0
took 0
in 0
2005 0
at 0
a 0
Congressional 0
Black 0
Caucus 0
meeting, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
public 0
because 0
he 0
believed 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
“made 0
a 0
difference” 0
to 0
Obama’s 0
political 0
future. 0

The 0
photographer, 0
Askia 0
Muhammad, 0
told 0
the 0
Trice 0
Edney 0
News 0
Wire 0
that 0
he 0
“gave 0
the 0
picture 0
up 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
basically 0
swore 0
secrecy.” 0
“But 0
after 0
the 0
nomination 0
was 0
secured 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
up 0
until 0
the 0
inauguration; 0
then 0
for 0
eight 0
years 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
President, 0
it 0
was 0
kept 0
under 0
cover,” 0
Muhammad 0
said. 0

Asked 0
whether 0
he 0
thought 0
the 0
photo’s 0
release 0
would 0
have 0
affected 0
Obama’s 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
Muhammad 0
said, 0
“I 0
insist. 0

It 0
absolutely 0
would 0

Reached 0

on 0
Thursday, 0
Muhammad 0
said 0
a 0
“staff 0
member” 0
for 0
the 0
CBC 0
contacted 0
him 0
“sort 1
of 1
in 1
a 1
panic” 1
after 0
he 0
took 0
the 0
photo 0
at 0
a 0
caucus 0
meeting 0
in 0
2005. 0

TPM 0
has 0
published 0
the 0
photo 0
above 0
with 0
Muhammad’s 0
permission. 0

“I 0
sort 0
of 0
understood 0
what 0
was 0
going 0
on,” 0
Muhammad 0
told 0
TPM. 0

“I 0
promised 0
and 0
made 0
arrangements 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
picture 0
to 0
Leonard 0
Farrakhan,” 0
the 0
minister’s 0
son-in-law 0
and 0
chief 0
of 0
staff. 0

Muhammad 0
said 0
he 0
gave 0
away 0
“the 0
disk” 0
from 0
his 0
camera 0
but 0
“copied 0
the 0
photograph 0
from 0
that 0
day 0
onto 0
a 0
file” 0
on 0
his 0
computer. 0

“Realizing 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
given 0
it 0
up, 0
I 0
mean, 0
it 0
was 0
sort 0
of 0
like 0
a 0
promise 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
photograph 0
secret,” 0
Muhammad 0
said. 0

Muhammad 0
said 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
release 0
his 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
photograph 0
because 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
perceived 0
as 0
a 0
betrayal 0
of 0
that 0
promise: 0
“I 0
was 0
really, 0
I 0
guess, 0
afraid 0
of 0
them.” 0

Malcolm 0
X 0
wasn’t 0
adequately 0
afraid 0
of 0
them. 0

Here’s 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
him: 0

https://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI 0

Muhammad 0
said 0
he 0
thought 0
the 0
photograph 0
would 0
be 0
“damaging 0
politically” 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
released 0
and 0
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
someone 1
might 1
“break 1
into 1
his 1
apartment” 1
looking 1
for 1
it, 1
like 0
“that 0
Watergate 0
crap.” 1
He 0
said 0
he 0
“felt 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
more 0
at 0
ease” 0
after 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
2016 0
claimed 0
that 0
Obama 0
visited 0
his 0
home 0
in 0
Chicago. 0

Muhammad 0
contacted 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
autumn 0
2017 0
with 0
the 0
“final 0
manuscript” 0
for 0
a 0
self-published 0
book 0
containing 0
the 0
photo. 0

“I 0
sent 0
him 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
manuscript 0
suggesting 0
that, 0
showing 0
him 0
the 0
picture, 0
and 0
saying 0
to 0
him, 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
object, 0
I 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
publish 0
it,” 0
Muhammad 0
said. 0

“He 0
had 0
no 0
objection.” 0
… 0
During 0
Obama’s 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
conservatives 0
pushed 0
multiple 0
apparently 0
racially 0
motivated 0
conspiracy 0
theories 0
about 0
Obama’s 0
religion 0
and 0
supposed 0
ties 0
to 0
Islam. 0

For 0
example, 0
in 0
Obama’s 0
memoir 0
subtitled 0
A 0
Story 0
of 0
Race 0
and 0
Inheritance, 0
Obama 0
recounts 0
his 0
being 0
a 0
regular 0
reader 0
of 0
Minister 0
Farrakhan’s 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
newspaper 0
The 0
Final 0
Call. 0

Obama 0
recollects 0
Farrakhan’s 0
black 0
nationalist 0
capitalist 0
campaign 0
to 0
get 0
black 0
people 0
to 0
use 0
toothpaste 0
manufactured 0
by 0
black-owned 0
businesses. 0

Farrakhan’s 0
eventual 0
failure 0
suggests 0
to 0
Obama 0
that’s 0
there 0
is 0
more 0
economic 0
upside 0
for 0
blacks 0
in 0
shaking 1
down 1
white 1
institutions 1
than 0
in 0
building 0
their 0
own. 0

During 0
the 0
2008 0
presidential 0
election, 0
conservatives 0
questioned 0
the 0
indirect 0
ties 0
between 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
Obama, 0
who 0
attended 0
a 0
church 0
that 0
gave 0
Farrakhan 0
an 0
award. 0

Obama’s 0
“spiritual 1
advisor” 1
Rev. 0

Jeremiah 0
Wright 0
gave 0
Farrakhan 0
his 0
church’s 0
Lifetime 0
Achievement 0
award 0
in 0
a 0
downtown 0
Chicago 0
Hyatt 0
Regency 0
in 0
November 0
2007, 0
but 0
the 0
story 0
didn’t 0
make 0
the 0
press 0
until 0
the 0
following 0
year. 0

Similarly, 0
very 0
little 0
media 0
attention 0
was 0
paid 0
to 0
the 0
close 0
relationship 0
between 0
Obama’s 0
fundraiser 0
and 0
private 0
mentor 0
Tony 0
Rezko 0
and 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam, 0
even 0
though 0
Rezko’s 0
role 0
was 0
business 0
manager 0
for 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
assets, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
career 0
of 0
Muhammad 0
Ali. 0

But 0
after 0
all, 0
what 0
could 0
be 0
more 0
boring 0
than 0
a 0
story 0
than 0
involves 0
a 0
Presidential 0
candidate, 0
the 0
Syrian 0
Christian 0
crook 0
who 0
helped 0
him 0
buy 0
his 0
house, 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam, 0
and 0
the 0
most 0
famous 0
boxer 0
of 0
all 0
time? 0

Reading 1
Obama’s 1
1995 1
memoir, 1
you 1
might 1
almost 1
get 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
after 1
a 1
prudent 1
first 1
term, 1
during 1
his 1
second 1
he 1
might 1
side 1
with, 1
I 1
dunno, 1
Black 1
Lives 1
Matter 1
and 1
encourage 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
black 1
rage 1
and 1
police 1
retreat 1
that 1
drove 1
up 1
the 1
death 1
toll 1
from 1
murder 1
by 1
20% 1
in 1
his 1
last 1
two 1
years 1
in 1
office, 1
an 1
incremental 1
death 1
toll 1
a 1
little 1
bigger 1
than 1
the 1
U.S. 1
combat 1
death 1
toll 1
from 1
the 1
equally 1
stupid 1
Iraq 1
War. 1
