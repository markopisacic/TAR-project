Madagascar 0

has 0
suffered 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
outbreaks 0
almost 0
every 0
year 0
since 0
1980, 0
often 0
caused 0
by 0

The 0

disease 0
tends 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
comeback 0
each 0
hot 0

season, 0
from 0
September 0

On 0

between 0
300 0
and 0
600 0
infections 0
are 0
recorded 0
every 0

among 0
a 0
population 0
approaching 0
25 0
million 0
people, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
UN 0
estimate. 0

But 0

Tedros 0
voiced 0
alarm 0
that 0
"plague 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
behaved 0
in 0
a 1
very, 1
very 1
different 1
way 0
this 0
year." 0

Cases 0

sprang 0
up 0
far 0
earlier 0
than 0
usual 0
and, 0
instead 0
of 0
being 0
confined 0
to 0
the 0
countryside, 0
the 0
disease 0
infiltrated 0
towns. 0

The 0
authorities 0
recorded 0
more 0
than 0
2 0
000 0
cases, 0
and 0
Tedros 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
the 0
death 0
toll 0
stood 0
at 0
207. 0

He 1

also 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
pneumonic 1
version, 1
which 1
spreads 1
more 1
easily 1
and 1
is 1
more 1
virulent, 1
in 1
the 1
latest 1
outbreak. 1

He 0

praised 0
the 0
rapid 0
response 0
from 0
WHO 0
and 0
Madagascar 0
authorities 0
that 0
helped 0
bring 0
the 0
outbreak 0
under 0
control, 0
but 1
warned 1
that 1
the 1
danger 1
was 1
not 1
over. 1

The 0

larger-than-usual 0
outbreak 0
had 0
helped 0
spread 0
the 0
bacteria 0
that 0
causes 0
the 0
plague 0
more 0
widely. 0

This 0

along 0
with 0
poor 0
sanitation 0
and 0
vector 0
control 0
on 0
Madagascar 0
meant 0
that 0
"when 1
(the 1
plague) 1
comes 1
again 1
it 1
starts 1
from 1
more 1
stock, 1
and 1
the 1
magnitude 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
transmission 1
could 1
be 1
higher 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
we 1
saw," 1
Tedros 0
said. 0

"That 0

means 0
that 0
Madagascar 0
could 0
be 0
affected 0
more, 0
and 0
not 0
only 0
that, 0
it 1
could 1
even 1
spill 1
over 1
into 1
neighbouring 1
countries 1
and 1
beyond," 1
he 0
warned. 0

Complicating 0

vector 0
control 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
fleas 0
that 0
carry 0
the 0
Yersinia 0
pestis 0
bacteria 0
that 0
causes 0
the 0
plague 0
have 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
widely 0
resistant 0
to 0
chemicals 0
and 0
insecticides. 0

"That's 0

a 0
dangerous 0
combination," 0
Tedros 0
said. 0
