At 0 335 9
a 0 335 9
Friday 0 335 9
hearing, 0 335 9
Saris 0 335 9
expressed 0 335 9
concern 0 335 9
that 0 335 9
ICE 0 335 9
had 0 335 9
broken 0 335 9
its 0 335 9
word 0 335 9
with 0 335 9
Rombot 0 335 9
after 0 335 9
telling 0 335 9
him 0 335 9
in 0 335 9
2015 0 335 9
that 0 335 9
he 0 335 9
would 0 335 9
"be 0 335 9
given 0 335 9
an 0 335 9
opportunity 0 335 9

for 0 335 9
an 0 335 9
orderly 0 335 9
departure" 0 335 9
before 0 335 9
being 0 335 9
deported. 0 335 9

She 0 335 10
also 0 335 10
expressed 0 335 10
concern 0 335 10
he 0 335 10
was 0 335 10
being 0 335 10
held 0 335 10
alongside 0 335 10
potentially 0 335 10
violent 0 335 10
criminals. 0 335 10

Her 0 335 11
problem 0 335 11
though 0 335 11
was 0 335 11
that 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
law 0 335 11
and 0 335 11
precedent 0 335 11
are 0 335 11
on 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
side 0 335 11
of 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
continued 0 335 11
deportation 0 335 11
of 0 335 11
aliens. 0 335 11

Kritarch 0 335 12
Saris 0 335 12
has 0 335 12
apparently 0 335 12
seen 0 335 12
the 0 335 12
SCOTUS 0 335 12
writing 0 335 12
on 0 335 12
the 0 335 12
wall, 0 335 12
and 0 335 12
perhaps 0 335 12
had 1 335 12
an 1 335 12
attack 1 335 12
of 1 335 12
her 1 335 12
legal 1 335 12
conscience 1 335 12
and 0 335 12
decided 0 335 12
that 0 335 12
she 0 335 12
will 0 335 12
acquiesce 0 335 12
on 0 335 12
the 0 335 12
major 0 335 12
issue, 0 335 12
but 0 335 12
fight 0 335 12
on 0 335 12
a 0 335 12
minor 0 335 12
issue. 0 335 12

Commonly 0 335 13
this 0 335 13
the 0 335 13
pattern 0 335 13
of 0 335 13
Judges 0 335 13

do. 0 335 13

Saris 0 335 14
has 0 335 14
apparently 0 335 14
decided 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
bend 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
inevitable 0 335 14
in 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
case 0 335 14
of 0 335 14

do 0 335 14
a 0 335 14
little 0 335 14
sabotage 0 335 14
instead.However, 0 335 14
she 1 335 14
will 1 335 14
not 1 335 14
let 1 335 14
it 1 335 14
go 1 335 14
quietly 1 335 14
into 1 335 14
the 1 335 14
night.What 1 335 14
we 0 335 14
have 0 335 14
here 0 335 14
is 0 335 14
that 0 335 14
Saris 0 335 14
realized 0 335 14
she 0 335 14
has 0 335 14
no 0 335 14
authority 0 335 14
over 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
deportation 0 335 14
of 0 335 14

but 0 335 14
she 0 335 14
will 0 335 14
do 0 335 14
her 0 335 14
best 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
throw 1 335 14

not 0 335 14
