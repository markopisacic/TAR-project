Kritarch 0

is 0
in 0
the 0
news 0
again. 0

She 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
many 0
Federal 0
District 0
Court 0
Judges 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
run 0
immigration 0
policy, 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Constitution 0
gives 0
authority 0
over 0
immigration 0
to 0
Congress, 0
and 0
Congress 0
has 0
allocated 0
considerable 0
authority 0
to 0
the 0
President. 0

This 0
writer 0
exposed 0
her 0
attempted 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
Constitution 0
after 0
she 0
initially 0
stopped 0
the 0
deportation 0
of 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Indonesians 0
back 0
to 0
Indonesia 0
as 0
she 0
saw 0
it 0
unjust 0
and 0
decided 0
to 0
substitute 0
her 0
moral 0
judgment 0
for 0
the 0
laws 0
of 0
the 0
United 0

At 0
a 0
Friday 0
hearing, 0
Saris 0
expressed 0
concern 0
that 0
ICE 0
had 0
broken 0
its 0
word 0
with 0
Rombot 0
after 0
telling 0
him 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
"be 0
given 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
prepare 0
for 0
an 0
orderly 0
departure" 0
before 0
being 0
deported. 0

She 0
also 0
expressed 0
concern 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
held 0
alongside 0
potentially 0
violent 0
criminals. 0

Her 0
problem 0
though 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
law 0
and 0
precedent 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
continued 0
deportation 0
of 0
aliens. 0

Kritarch 0
Saris 0
has 0
apparently 0
seen 0
the 0
SCOTUS 0
writing 0
on 0
the 0
wall, 0
and 0
perhaps 0
had 1
an 1
attack 1
of 1
her 1
legal 1
conscience 1
and 0
decided 0
that 0
she 0
will 0
acquiesce 0
on 0
the 0
major 0
issue, 0
but 0
fight 0
on 0
a 0
minor 0
issue. 0

Commonly 0
this 0
the 0
pattern 0
of 0
Judges 0
who 0
don't 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
overruled 0
as 0
frequently 0
as 0
9th 0
Circuit 0
Judges 0
do. 0

Saris 0
has 0
apparently 0
decided 0
to 0
bend 0
to 0
the 0
inevitable 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Indonesians, 0
who 0
had 0
years 0
of 0
hearings 0
and 0
appeals, 0
all 0
to 0
naught, 0
but 0
do 0
a 0
little 0
sabotage 0
instead.However, 0
she 1
will 1
not 1
let 1
it 1
go 1
quietly 1
into 1
the 1
night.What 1
we 0
have 0
here 0
is 0
that 0
Saris 0
realized 0
she 0
has 0
no 0
authority 0
over 0
the 0
deportation 0
of 0
illegal 1
aliens, 1
but 0
she 0
will 0
do 0
her 0
best 0
to 0
throw 1
a 1
wrench 1
in 0
the 0
works 0
by 0
attempting 0
to 0
get 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
released 0
from 0
custody, 0
so 0
they 0
can 0
then 0
disappear 0
into 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
consequently 0
not 0
be 0
deported. 0

issued 0
by 0
the 0
Attorney 0

an 0

may 0

whether 0

for 0
an 0

Lawyers 0
submitted 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
him 0
from 0
ICE 0
saying 0
that 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
2010 0
deal 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
country 0
in 0
an 0
“orderly” 0
way. 0

“ICE 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
most 0
orderly 0
way 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
depart 0
was 0
for 0
us 0
to 0
remove 0
him,” 0
Stevens 0
said. 0

Saris 0
expressed 0
a 0
dim 0
view 0
of 0
that 0
move. 0

“The 0
government 0
broke 0
a 0
promise,” 0
Saris 0
said. 0

“That’s 0

thing 0

However, 0
the 0
law 0
is 0
quite 0
clear, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0

T 0
itle 0

United 0

Code, 0
Section 0
1226, 0
Arrest 0

Detention 0
Of 0
Aliens 0
, 0
gives 0
such 0
authority 0
to 0
the 0

despite 0
her 0
realization 0
that 0
she 0
has 0
no 0
authority 0
over 0
immigration 0
policy, 0
or 0
that 0
she 0
will 0
just 0
be 0
overruled, 0
Saris 0
again 0
reaches, 0
basing 1
her 1
assumption 1
of 1
authority 1
over 1
immigration 1
based 1
on 1
the 1
past 1
Obama 1
Regime 1
Administrative 1
Amnesty 1
, 0
when 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
weren't 0
deported.Kritarch 0
Saris 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
on 0
both 0
counts; 0
she 0
has 0
neither 0
authority 0
over 0
the 0
detention 0
of 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
nor 0
any 0
authority 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
Obama 0
Regime 0
Administrative 0
Amnesty. 0

She 1
is 1
like 1
Derrick 1
Kahala 1
Watson 1
, 1
a 1
treasonous 1
kritarch, 1
unwilling 0
to 0
submit 0
her 0
hunger 0
for 0
power 0
and 0
ideology 0
to 0
the 0
Constitution 0
and 0
the 0
law. 0

Impeachment 1
for 1
her 1
and 1
Watson 1
is 1
the 1
solution. 1
