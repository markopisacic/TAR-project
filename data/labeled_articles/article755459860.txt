Don't 1 340 1
say 1 340 1
you 1 340 1
were 1 340 1
not 1 340 1
warned, 1 340 1
America. 1 340 1

Don't 0 340 3
get 0 340 3
me 0 340 3
wrong 0 340 3
here. 0 340 3

I'm 0 340 4
not 0 340 4
for 0 340 4
the 0 340 4
government 0 340 4
of 0 340 4
Iran. 0 340 4

I 0 340 5
despise 1 340 5
Islam 0 340 5

I 0 340 5

Overall, 0 340 6
the 0 340 6
people 0 340 6
of 0 340 6
Iran 0 340 6
are 0 340 6
probably 0 340 6
some 0 340 6
decent 0 340 6
people, 0 340 6
but 0 340 6
those 0 340 6
in 0 340 6
leadership 0 340 6
have 0 340 6
issues, 0 340 6
but 0 340 6
that 0 340 6
is 0 340 6
something 0 340 6
for 0 340 6
the 0 340 6
people 0 340 6
there 0 340 6
to 0 340 6
deal 0 340 6

Iran 0 340 7

just 0 340 25
that, 0 340 25
I 0 340 25
am 0 340 25
not 0 340 25
so 0 340 25
naive 0 340 25
as 0 340 25
to 0 340 25
consider 0 340 25
that 0 340 25

"The 0 340 26
ordinary 0 340 26

SSG 0 340 26
writes 0 340 26
in 0 340 26
the 0 340 26
paper. 0 340 26

"This 0 340 27
has 0 340 27
provoked 0 340 27
noteworthy 0 340 27
protests 0 340 27
across 0 340 27
the 0 340 27
country 0 340 27
in 0 340 27
recent 0 340 27
months." 0 340 27

Well, 0 340 28
why 0 340 28
is 0 340 28
that? 0 340 28

It's 0 340 29
due 0 340 29
to 0 340 29
sanctions 0 340 29
imposed 0 340 29
by 0 340 29
the 0 340 29
likes 0 340 29
of 0 340 29
the 0 340 29
US. 0 340 29

As 0 340 30
has 0 340 30
been 0 340 30
pointed 0 340 30
out 0 340 30
before, 0 340 30
sanctions 0 340 30
hurt 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
people, 0 340 30
not 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
governments 0 340 30
that 0 340 30
lead 0 340 30
them 0 340 30
and 0 340 30
then 0 340 30
those 0 340 30
same 0 340 30
governments 0 340 30
use 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
effects 0 340 30
to 0 340 30
propagandize 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
people 0 340 30
against 0 340 30
those 0 340 30
who 0 340 30
are 0 340 30
ordering 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
sanctions. 0 340 30

I'm 0 340 31
not 0 340 31
saying 0 340 31
the 0 340 31
Iranian 0 340 31
government 0 340 31
is 0 340 31
good, 0 340 31
but 0 340 31
it 0 340 31
is 0 340 31
Iran's 0 340 31
government. 0 340 31

Honestly, 0 340 32
I 0 340 32
see 0 340 32
a 0 340 32
ton 0 340 32
of 0 340 32
corruption 0 340 32
and 0 340 32
warmongering 0 340 32
in 0 340 32
our 0 340 32
own 0 340 32
government 0 340 32
that 0 340 32
rivals 0 340 32
some 0 340 32
of 0 340 32
that 0 340 32
of 0 340 32
governments 0 340 32
that 0 340 32
America 0 340 32
stands 0 340 32
against. 0 340 32

Still, 0 340 33
as 0 340 33
was 0 340 33
pointed 0 340 33
out 0 340 33

this 0 340 34
room 0 340 34
today. 0 340 34

I 0 340 35
had 0 340 35
said 0 340 35
for 0 340 35
over 0 340 35
10 0 340 35
years 0 340 35
since 0 340 35
coming 0 340 35
to 0 340 35
these 0 340 35
events, 0 340 35
that 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
declared 0 340 35
policy 0 340 35
of 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
United 0 340 35
States 0 340 35
of 0 340 35
America 0 340 35
should 0 340 35
be 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
overthrow 0 340 35
of 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
mullahs’ 0 340 35
regime 0 340 35
in 0 340 35
Tehran. 0 340 35

The 0 340 36
behavior 0 340 36
and 0 340 36
the 0 340 36
objectives 0 340 36
of 0 340 36
the 0 340 36
regime 0 340 36
are 0 340 36
not 0 340 36
going 0 340 36
to 0 340 36
change, 0 340 36
and 0 340 36
therefore 0 340 36
the 1 340 36
only 1 340 36
solution 1 340 36
is 0 340 36
to 0 340 36
change 0 340 36
the 0 340 36
regime 0 340 36
itself. 0 340 36

And 0 340 37
that’s 0 340 37
why, 0 340 37
before 0 340 37
2019, 0 340 37
we 0 340 37
here 0 340 37
will 0 340 37
celebrate 0 340 37
in 0 340 37
Tehran!” 0 340 37

And 0 340 38
again, 0 340 38
this 0 340 38
really 0 340 38
has 0 340 38
nothing 0 340 38
to 0 340 38
do 0 340 38
with 0 340 38
the 0 340 38
US. 0 340 38

One 0 340 39
source 0 340 39
close 0 340 39
to 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
White 0 340 39
House 0 340 39
who 0 340 39
has 0 340 39
previewed 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
plan 0 340 39
told 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
Free 0 340 39

that 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
nuclear 0 340 39

also 0 340 39
known 0 340 39
as 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
JCPOA, 0 340 39
solidified 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
Iranian 0 340 39
regime’s 0 340 39
grip 0 340 39
on 0 340 39
power 0 340 39
and 0 340 39
intentionally 0 340 39
prevented 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
United 0 340 39
States 0 340 39
from 0 340 39
fomenting 0 340 39

change. 0 340 39

“The 0 340 40

said 0 340 40
the 0 340 40
source, 0 340 40
who 0 340 40
would 0 340 40
only 0 340 40
speak 0 340 40
to 0 340 40
the 0 340 40
Free 0 340 40
Beacon 0 340 40
on 0 340 40
background 0 340 40
about 0 340 40
the 0 340 40
sensitive 0 340 40
issue. 0 340 40

“Prior 0 340 41
to 0 340 41
that, 0 340 41
everyone 0 340 41
understood 0 340 41
the 0 340 41
dangers 0 340 41
of 0 340 41
playing 0 340 41
footsie 0 340 41
with 0 340 41
the 0 340 41
world’s 0 340 41
largest 0 340 41
state 0 340 41

of 0 340 41

It’s 0 340 42
now 0 340 42
Trump, 0 340 42
Bolton, 0 340 42
and 0 340 42
[Mike] 0 340 42
Pompeo’s 0 340 42

to 0 340 42
put 0 340 42
this 0 340 42

back 0 340 42
in 0 340 42
place.” 0 340 42

The 0 340 43
source 0 340 43
told 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
Beacon 0 340 43
that 0 340 43
Bolton 0 340 43
is 0 340 43
“acutely 0 340 43
aware 0 340 43
of 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
danger 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
Iranian 0 340 43
regime 0 340 43
poses 0 340 43
to 0 340 43

“John 0 340 44
is 0 340 44

danger 0 340 44
of 0 340 44
Iran 0 340 44
viscerally, 0 340 44
and 0 340 44
knows 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
you’re 0 340 44
never 0 340 44
going 0 340 44
to 0 340 44
fundamentally 0 340 44
change 0 340 44
its 0 340 44
behavior—and 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
threats 0 340 44
against 0 340 44
Israel 0 340 44
and 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
Saudis 0 340 44
especially—until 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
revolutionary 0 340 44
regime 0 340 44
is 0 340 44
gone,” 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
source 0 340 44
said, 0 340 44
adding 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
“nothing’s 0 340 44
off 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
table 0 340 44
right 0 340 44
now 0 340 44
if 0 340 44
Israel 0 340 44
is 0 340 44
attacked.” 0 340 44

OK, 0 340 45
I 0 340 45
get 0 340 45
they 0 340 45
may 0 340 45
pose 0 340 45
a 0 340 45
danger, 0 340 45
but 0 340 45
let's 0 340 45
look 0 340 45
at 0 340 45
the 0 340 45
reality 0 340 45
here. 0 340 45

Those 0 340 46
they 0 340 46
pose 0 340 46
a 0 340 46
danger 0 340 46
to, 0 340 46
namely 0 340 46
Saudi 0 340 46
Arabia 0 340 46
and 0 340 46
Israel 0 340 46
can 0 340 46
both 0 340 46
fend 0 340 46
perfectly 0 340 46
well 0 340 46
for 0 340 46
themselves 0 340 46
and 0 340 46
have 0 340 46
demonstrated 0 340 46
that 0 340 46
ability 0 340 46
to 0 340 46
do 0 340 46
it. 0 340 46

There 0 340 47
is 0 340 47
no 0 340 47
need 0 340 47
for 0 340 47
the 0 340 47
US 0 340 47
to 0 340 47
be 0 340 47
involved 0 340 47
in 0 340 47
it 0 340 47
in 0 340 47
any 0 340 47
way. 0 340 47

Why 0 340 48
should 0 340 48
we 0 340 48
be 0 340 48
fighting 0 340 48
a 0 340 48
battle 0 340 48
or 0 340 48
encouraging, 0 340 48
funding, 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
I'm 0 340 48
quite 0 340 48
sure 0 340 48
arming, 0 340 48
a 0 340 48
rebellion? 0 340 48

Where 0 340 49
is 0 340 49
that 0 340 49
authorized 0 340 49
in 0 340 49
our 1 340 49
Constitution? 1 340 49

Simple. 0 340 50

It 0 340 51
isn't. 0 340 51

I 0 340 52
care 0 340 52
little 0 340 52
for 0 340 52
the 0 340 52
Saudi 0 340 52
government 0 340 52
as 0 340 52
they 0 340 52
help 0 340 52
push 0 340 52
Sharia 0 340 52
and 0 340 52
is 0 340 52
the 0 340 52
land 0 340 52
where 0 340 52
many 0 340 52
of 0 340 52
the 0 340 52
9-11 0 340 52
hijackers 0 340 52
came 0 340 52
from. 0 340 52

The 0 340 53
Iranian 0 340 53
government 0 340 53
I 0 340 53
care 0 340 53
for 0 340 53
even 0 340 53
less, 0 340 53
but 0 340 53
out 0 340 53
of 0 340 53
each 0 340 53
of 0 340 53
those, 0 340 53
which 0 340 53
one 0 340 53
should 0 340 53
America 0 340 53
have 0 340 53
dealt 0 340 53
with 0 340 53
militarily 0 340 53
following 0 340 53
9-11? 0 340 53

Both, 0 340 54
if 0 340 54
you're 0 340 54
going 0 340 54
to 0 340 54
go 0 340 54
by 0 340 54
information 0 340 54
that 0 340 54
we 0 340 54
have 0 340 54
a 0 340 54
record 0 340 54
on. 0 340 54

Why 0 340 55
can't 0 340 55
America 0 340 55
focus 0 340 55
on 0 340 55
it's 0 340 55
own 0 340 55
issues 0 340 55
and 0 340 55
solve 0 340 55
those? 0 340 55

It's 0 340 56
because 0 340 56
we 0 340 56
are 0 340 56
too 0 340 56
busy 0 340 56
trying 0 340 56
to 0 340 56
police 0 340 56
the 0 340 56
world, 0 340 56
keeping 0 340 56
the 0 340 56
spotlight 0 340 56
off 0 340 56
of 0 340 56
those 0 340 56
in 0 340 56
our 0 340 56
government 0 340 56
who 0 340 56
are 0 340 56
attacking 0 340 56
our 0 340 56
rights 0 340 56
and 0 340 56
spending 0 340 56
us 0 340 56
into 0 340 56
more 0 340 56
and 0 340 56
more 0 340 56
debt. 0 340 56

And 0 340 57
lest 0 340 57
you 0 340 57
think 0 340 57
this 0 340 57
is 0 340 57
about 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
nuclear 0 340 57
deal. 0 340 57

It 0 340 58
isn't. 0 340 58

“The 0 340 59
problem 0 340 59
is 0 340 59

the 0 340 59
Iranian 0 340 59
regime,” 0 340 59
the 0 340 59
source 0 340 59
told 0 340 59
the 0 340 59
Beacon. 0 340 59

“Team 0 340 60

it 0 340 63
will 0 340 63

in 0 340 63

I 1 340 64
don't 1 340 64

it. 1 340 64

This 0 340 65
will 0 340 65

end 0 340 65
up 0 340 65
being 0 340 65

don't 0 340 65

know, 0 340 65
I'll 0 340 65
be 0 340 65

Iran, 0 340 71
America 1 340 71
will 1 340 71
face 1 340 71
a 1 340 71
choice 1 340 71
between 1 340 71
accepting 1 340 71
a 1 340 71
nuclear-armed 1 340 71
Iran 1 340 71
or 1 340 71
acting 1 340 71
to 1 340 71
destroy 1 340 71
as 1 340 71
much 1 340 71
of 1 340 71
this 1 340 71
capability 1 340 71
as 1 340 71
possible.” 1 340 71

President 0 340 72
Trump 0 340 72
did 0 340 72
made 0 340 72
clear 0 340 72
earlier 0 340 72
in 0 340 72
the 0 340 72
week 0 340 72
that 0 340 72
we 0 340 72
must 0 340 72
make 0 340 72
efforts 0 340 72
to 0 340 72
differentiate 0 340 72
between 0 340 72
the 0 340 72
people 0 340 72
of 0 340 72
Iran 0 340 72
and 0 340 72
its 0 340 72
ruling 0 340 72
regime. 0 340 72

Well, 0 340 73
I 0 340 73
agree, 0 340 73
but 0 340 73
that 0 340 73
gets 0 340 73
real 0 340 73
messy 0 340 73
when 0 340 73
you 0 340 73
start 0 340 73
intervening 0 340 73
in 0 340 73
this 0 340 73
manner. 0 340 73

“Any 0 340 74
public 0 340 74
discussion 0 340 74
of 0 340 74
these 0 340 74
options, 0 340 74
and 0 340 74
any 0 340 74
messaging 0 340 74
about 0 340 74
the 0 340 74
Iranian 0 340 74
regime 0 340 74
in 0 340 74
general, 0 340 74
should 0 340 74
make 0 340 74
a 0 340 74
bright 0 340 74
line 0 340 74
distinction 0 340 74
between 0 340 74
the 0 340 74
theocratic 0 340 74
regime 0 340 74
along 0 340 74
with 0 340 74
its 0 340 74
organs 0 340 74
of 0 340 74
oppression 0 340 74
and 0 340 74
the 0 340 74
general 0 340 74
populace,” 0 340 74
according 0 340 74
to 0 340 74
the 0 340 74
plan. 0 340 74

“We 0 340 75
must 0 340 75
constantly 0 340 75
reinforce 0 340 75
our 0 340 75
support 0 340 75
for 0 340 75
removing 0 340 75
the 0 340 75
iron 0 340 75
sandal 0 340 75
from 0 340 75
the 0 340 75
necks 0 340 75
of 0 340 75
the 0 340 75
people 0 340 75
to 0 340 75
allow 0 340 75
them 0 340 75
the 0 340 75
freedom 0 340 75
they 0 340 75
deserve.” 0 340 75

But 0 340 76
the 0 340 76
Trump 0 340 76
administration 0 340 76
has 0 340 76
spoken 0 340 76
out 0 340 76
on 0 340 76
other 0 340 76
countries 0 340 76
where 0 340 76
the 0 340 76
people 0 340 76
want 0 340 76
their 0 340 76
independence. 0 340 76

Remember 0 340 77
the 0 340 77
Kurds? 0 340 77

How 0 340 78
about 0 340 78
the 0 340 78
people 0 340 78
in 0 340 78
the 0 340 78
Catalan 0 340 78
region 0 340 78
of 0 340 78
Spain? 0 340 78

No 0 340 79
support 0 340 79
for 0 340 79
those 0 340 79
people, 0 340 79
and 0 340 79
why? 0 340 79

Cause 0 340 80
it's 0 340 80
not 0 340 80
part 0 340 80
of 0 340 80
the 0 340 80
agenda. 0 340 80

I 0 340 81
say 0 340 81
if 0 340 81
the 0 340 81
Iranian 0 340 81
people 0 340 81
want 0 340 81
their 0 340 81
freedom, 0 340 81
let 0 340 81
them 0 340 81
first 0 340 81
free 0 340 81
themselves 0 340 81
from 0 340 81
the 0 340 81
bondage 0 340 81
of 0 340 81
Islam, 0 340 81
and 0 340 81
then 0 340 81
let 0 340 81
the 0 340 81
passion 0 340 81
that 0 340 81
burns 0 340 81
inside 0 340 81
men 0 340 81
to 0 340 81
be 0 340 81
free 0 340 81
rise 0 340 81
up 0 340 81
as 0 340 81
it 0 340 81
did 0 340 81
in 0 340 81
our 0 340 81
forefathers 0 340 81
due 0 340 81
to 0 340 81
the 0 340 81
teachings 0 340 81
fo 0 340 81
the 0 340 81
Holy 0 340 81
Scriptures 0 340 81
and 0 340 81
stand 0 340 81
and 0 340 81
fight. 0 340 81

Then, 0 340 82
they 0 340 82
will 0 340 82
be 0 340 82
in 0 340 82
a 0 340 82
position 0 340 82
to 0 340 82
ask 0 340 82
for 0 340 82
aid, 0 340 82
but 0 340 82
only 0 340 82
then. 0 340 82
