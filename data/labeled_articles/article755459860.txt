Don't 1 215 1

you 1 215 1
were 1 215 1
not 1 215 1

Don't 0 215 3
get 0 215 3
me 0 215 3
wrong 0 215 3
here. 0 215 3

I'm 0 215 4
not 0 215 4
for 0 215 4

I 0 215 5

Overall, 0 215 6
the 0 215 6
people 0 215 6
of 0 215 6

are 0 215 6
probably 0 215 6
some 0 215 6
decent 0 215 6
people, 0 215 6
but 0 215 6
those 0 215 6
in 0 215 6

have 0 215 6
issues, 0 215 6
but 0 215 6
that 0 215 6
is 0 215 6
something 0 215 6
for 0 215 6
the 0 215 6

there 0 215 6
to 0 215 6

that, 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
am 0 215 25
not 0 215 25
so 0 215 25
naive 0 215 25
as 0 215 25
to 0 215 25
consider 0 215 25

"The 0 215 26

SSG 0 215 26
writes 0 215 26
in 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
paper. 0 215 26

"This 0 215 27
has 0 215 27
provoked 0 215 27
noteworthy 0 215 27
protests 0 215 27
across 0 215 27
the 0 215 27
country 0 215 27
in 0 215 27
recent 0 215 27
months." 0 215 27

Well, 0 215 28
why 0 215 28
is 0 215 28
that? 0 215 28

It's 0 215 29
due 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
sanctions 0 215 29
imposed 0 215 29
by 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
likes 0 215 29
of 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
US. 0 215 29

As 0 215 30
has 0 215 30
been 0 215 30
pointed 0 215 30
out 0 215 30
before, 0 215 30
sanctions 0 215 30
hurt 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
people, 0 215 30
not 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
governments 0 215 30
that 0 215 30
lead 0 215 30
them 0 215 30
and 0 215 30
then 0 215 30
those 0 215 30
same 0 215 30
governments 0 215 30
use 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
effects 0 215 30
to 0 215 30
propagandize 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
people 0 215 30
against 0 215 30
those 0 215 30
who 0 215 30
are 0 215 30
ordering 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
sanctions. 0 215 30

I'm 0 215 31
not 0 215 31
saying 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
Iranian 0 215 31
government 0 215 31
is 0 215 31
good, 0 215 31
but 0 215 31
it 0 215 31
is 0 215 31
Iran's 0 215 31
government. 0 215 31

Honestly, 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
see 0 215 32
a 0 215 32
ton 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
corruption 0 215 32
and 0 215 32
warmongering 0 215 32
in 0 215 32
our 0 215 32
own 0 215 32
government 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
rivals 0 215 32
some 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
governments 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
America 0 215 32
stands 0 215 32
against. 0 215 32

Still, 0 215 33

this 0 215 34
room 0 215 34
today. 0 215 34

I 0 215 35
had 0 215 35
said 0 215 35
for 0 215 35
over 0 215 35
10 0 215 35
years 0 215 35
since 0 215 35
coming 0 215 35
to 0 215 35
these 0 215 35
events, 0 215 35
that 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
declared 0 215 35
policy 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
United 0 215 35
States 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
America 0 215 35
should 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
overthrow 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
mullahs’ 0 215 35
regime 0 215 35
in 0 215 35
Tehran. 0 215 35

The 0 215 36
behavior 0 215 36
and 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
objectives 0 215 36
of 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
regime 0 215 36
are 0 215 36
not 0 215 36
going 0 215 36
to 0 215 36
change, 0 215 36
and 0 215 36
therefore 0 215 36
the 1 215 36
only 1 215 36
solution 1 215 36
is 0 215 36
to 0 215 36
change 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
regime 0 215 36
itself. 0 215 36

And 0 215 37
that’s 0 215 37
why, 0 215 37
before 0 215 37
2019, 0 215 37
we 0 215 37
here 0 215 37
will 0 215 37
celebrate 0 215 37
in 0 215 37
Tehran!” 0 215 37

And 0 215 38
again, 0 215 38
this 0 215 38
really 0 215 38
has 0 215 38
nothing 0 215 38
to 0 215 38
do 0 215 38
with 0 215 38
the 0 215 38
US. 0 215 38

One 0 215 39
source 0 215 39
close 0 215 39
to 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
White 0 215 39
House 0 215 39
who 0 215 39

also 0 215 39
known 0 215 39
as 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
JCPOA, 0 215 39
solidified 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
Iranian 0 215 39
regime’s 0 215 39
grip 0 215 39
on 0 215 39
power 0 215 39
and 0 215 39
intentionally 0 215 39
prevented 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
United 0 215 39
States 0 215 39
from 0 215 39
fomenting 0 215 39

said 0 215 40
the 0 215 40

who 0 215 40
would 0 215 40
only 0 215 40
speak 0 215 40
to 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
Free 0 215 40

on 0 215 40
background 0 215 40
about 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
sensitive 0 215 40
issue. 0 215 40

“Prior 0 215 41
to 0 215 41
that, 0 215 41
everyone 0 215 41
understood 0 215 41
the 0 215 41
dangers 0 215 41
of 0 215 41
playing 0 215 41

now 0 215 42

and 0 215 42

The 0 215 43
source 0 215 43
told 0 215 43
the 0 215 43
Beacon 0 215 43
that 0 215 43
Bolton 0 215 43
is 0 215 43
“acutely 0 215 43

of 0 215 44

viscerally, 0 215 44
and 0 215 44
knows 0 215 44
that 0 215 44
you’re 0 215 44
never 0 215 44
going 0 215 44
to 0 215 44
fundamentally 0 215 44

the 0 215 44

against 0 215 44
Israel 0 215 44
and 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
Saudis 0 215 44
especially—until 0 215 44
that 0 215 44
revolutionary 0 215 44
regime 0 215 44
is 0 215 44
gone,” 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
source 0 215 44
said, 0 215 44
adding 0 215 44
that 0 215 44
“nothing’s 0 215 44
off 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
table 0 215 44
right 0 215 44
now 0 215 44
if 0 215 44
Israel 0 215 44

attacked.” 0 215 44

OK, 0 215 45
I 0 215 45
get 0 215 45
they 0 215 45
may 0 215 45
pose 0 215 45
a 0 215 45
danger, 0 215 45
but 0 215 45
let's 0 215 45
look 0 215 45
at 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
reality 0 215 45
here. 0 215 45

Those 0 215 46
they 0 215 46
pose 0 215 46
a 0 215 46
danger 0 215 46
to, 0 215 46
namely 0 215 46
Saudi 0 215 46
Arabia 0 215 46
and 0 215 46
Israel 0 215 46
can 0 215 46
both 0 215 46
fend 0 215 46
perfectly 0 215 46
well 0 215 46
for 0 215 46
themselves 0 215 46
and 0 215 46
have 0 215 46
demonstrated 0 215 46
that 0 215 46
ability 0 215 46
to 0 215 46
do 0 215 46
it. 0 215 46

There 0 215 47
is 0 215 47
no 0 215 47
need 0 215 47
for 0 215 47
the 0 215 47
US 0 215 47
to 0 215 47
be 0 215 47
involved 0 215 47
in 0 215 47
it 0 215 47
in 0 215 47
any 0 215 47
way. 0 215 47

Why 0 215 48
should 0 215 48
we 0 215 48
be 0 215 48
fighting 0 215 48
a 0 215 48
battle 0 215 48
or 0 215 48
encouraging, 0 215 48
funding, 0 215 48
and 0 215 48
I'm 0 215 48
quite 0 215 48
sure 0 215 48
arming, 0 215 48
a 0 215 48
rebellion? 0 215 48

Where 0 215 49
is 0 215 49
that 0 215 49
authorized 0 215 49
in 0 215 49
our 1 215 49
Constitution? 1 215 49

Simple. 0 215 50

It 0 215 51
isn't. 0 215 51

I 0 215 52
care 0 215 52
little 0 215 52
for 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
Saudi 0 215 52
government 0 215 52
as 0 215 52
they 0 215 52
help 0 215 52
push 0 215 52
Sharia 0 215 52
and 0 215 52
is 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
land 0 215 52
where 0 215 52
many 0 215 52
of 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
9-11 0 215 52
hijackers 0 215 52
came 0 215 52
from. 0 215 52

The 0 215 53
Iranian 0 215 53
government 0 215 53
I 0 215 53
care 0 215 53
for 0 215 53
even 0 215 53
less, 0 215 53
but 0 215 53
out 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
each 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
those, 0 215 53
which 0 215 53
one 0 215 53
should 0 215 53
America 0 215 53
have 0 215 53
dealt 0 215 53
with 0 215 53
militarily 0 215 53
following 0 215 53
9-11? 0 215 53

Both, 0 215 54
if 0 215 54
you're 0 215 54
going 0 215 54
to 0 215 54
go 0 215 54
by 0 215 54
information 0 215 54
that 0 215 54
we 0 215 54
have 0 215 54
a 0 215 54
record 0 215 54
on. 0 215 54

Why 0 215 55
can't 0 215 55
America 0 215 55
focus 0 215 55
on 0 215 55
it's 0 215 55
own 0 215 55
issues 0 215 55
and 0 215 55
solve 0 215 55
those? 0 215 55

It's 0 215 56
because 0 215 56
we 0 215 56
are 0 215 56
too 0 215 56
busy 0 215 56
trying 0 215 56
to 0 215 56
police 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
world, 0 215 56
keeping 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
spotlight 0 215 56
off 0 215 56
of 0 215 56
those 0 215 56
in 0 215 56
our 0 215 56
government 0 215 56
who 0 215 56
are 0 215 56
attacking 0 215 56
our 0 215 56
rights 0 215 56
and 0 215 56
spending 0 215 56
us 0 215 56
into 0 215 56
more 0 215 56
and 0 215 56
more 0 215 56
debt. 0 215 56

And 0 215 57
lest 0 215 57
you 0 215 57
think 0 215 57
this 0 215 57
is 0 215 57
about 0 215 57
the 0 215 57
nuclear 0 215 57
deal. 0 215 57

It 0 215 58
isn't. 0 215 58

“The 0 215 59

Iran, 0 215 71
America 1 215 71
will 1 215 71
face 1 215 71
a 1 215 71
choice 1 215 71
between 1 215 71
accepting 1 215 71
a 1 215 71
nuclear-armed 1 215 71
Iran 1 215 71
or 1 215 71
acting 1 215 71
to 1 215 71
destroy 1 215 71
as 1 215 71
much 1 215 71
of 1 215 71
this 1 215 71
capability 1 215 71
as 1 215 71
possible.” 1 215 71

President 0 215 72
Trump 0 215 72
did 0 215 72
made 0 215 72
clear 0 215 72
earlier 0 215 72
in 0 215 72
the 0 215 72
week 0 215 72
that 0 215 72
we 0 215 72
must 0 215 72
make 0 215 72
efforts 0 215 72
to 0 215 72
differentiate 0 215 72
between 0 215 72
the 0 215 72
people 0 215 72
of 0 215 72
Iran 0 215 72
and 0 215 72
its 0 215 72
ruling 0 215 72
regime. 0 215 72

Well, 0 215 73
I 0 215 73
agree, 0 215 73
but 0 215 73
that 0 215 73
gets 0 215 73
real 0 215 73
messy 0 215 73
when 0 215 73
you 0 215 73
start 0 215 73
intervening 0 215 73
in 0 215 73
this 0 215 73
manner. 0 215 73

“Any 0 215 74
public 0 215 74
discussion 0 215 74
of 0 215 74
these 0 215 74
options, 0 215 74
and 0 215 74
any 0 215 74
messaging 0 215 74
about 0 215 74
the 0 215 74
Iranian 0 215 74
regime 0 215 74
in 0 215 74
general, 0 215 74
should 0 215 74
make 0 215 74
a 0 215 74
bright 0 215 74
line 0 215 74
distinction 0 215 74
between 0 215 74
the 0 215 74
theocratic 0 215 74
regime 0 215 74
along 0 215 74
with 0 215 74
its 0 215 74
organs 0 215 74
of 0 215 74
oppression 0 215 74
and 0 215 74
the 0 215 74
general 0 215 74
populace,” 0 215 74
according 0 215 74
to 0 215 74
the 0 215 74
plan. 0 215 74

“We 0 215 75
must 0 215 75
constantly 0 215 75
reinforce 0 215 75
our 0 215 75
support 0 215 75
for 0 215 75
removing 0 215 75
the 0 215 75
iron 0 215 75
sandal 0 215 75
from 0 215 75
the 0 215 75
necks 0 215 75
of 0 215 75
the 0 215 75
people 0 215 75
to 0 215 75
allow 0 215 75
them 0 215 75
the 0 215 75
freedom 0 215 75
they 0 215 75
deserve.” 0 215 75

But 0 215 76
the 0 215 76
Trump 0 215 76
administration 0 215 76
has 0 215 76
spoken 0 215 76
out 0 215 76
on 0 215 76
other 0 215 76
countries 0 215 76
where 0 215 76
the 0 215 76
people 0 215 76
want 0 215 76
their 0 215 76
independence. 0 215 76

Remember 0 215 77
the 0 215 77
Kurds? 0 215 77

How 0 215 78
about 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
people 0 215 78
in 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
Catalan 0 215 78
region 0 215 78
of 0 215 78
Spain? 0 215 78

No 0 215 79
support 0 215 79
for 0 215 79
those 0 215 79
people, 0 215 79
and 0 215 79
why? 0 215 79

Cause 0 215 80
it's 0 215 80
not 0 215 80
part 0 215 80
of 0 215 80
the 0 215 80
agenda. 0 215 80

I 0 215 81
say 0 215 81
if 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
Iranian 0 215 81
people 0 215 81
want 0 215 81
their 0 215 81
freedom, 0 215 81
let 0 215 81
them 0 215 81
first 0 215 81
free 0 215 81
themselves 0 215 81
from 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
bondage 0 215 81
of 0 215 81
Islam, 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
then 0 215 81
let 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
passion 0 215 81
that 0 215 81
burns 0 215 81
inside 0 215 81
men 0 215 81
to 0 215 81
be 0 215 81
free 0 215 81
rise 0 215 81
up 0 215 81
as 0 215 81
it 0 215 81
did 0 215 81
in 0 215 81
our 0 215 81
forefathers 0 215 81
due 0 215 81
to 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
teachings 0 215 81
fo 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
Holy 0 215 81
Scriptures 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
stand 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
fight. 0 215 81

Then, 0 215 81

they 0 215 81

will 0 215 81

be 0 215 81

in 0 215 81

a 0 215 81

position 0 215 81

to 0 215 81

ask 0 215 81

for 0 215 81

aid, 0 215 81

but 0 215 81

only 0 215 81

then. 0 215 81
