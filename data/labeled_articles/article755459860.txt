Don't 1

you 1

America. 1

Apparently, 0
the 0
US 0
didn't 0
learn 0
from 0
its 0
first 0

in 0

change 0
decades 0

is 0
now 0
prepared 0

give 0
it 0
another 0
shot, 0

Don't 0
get 0
me 0
wrong 0
here. 0

I'm 0
not 0
for 0
the 0
government 0
of 0
Iran. 0

I 0
despise 1
Islam 0

I 0
despise 1
the 0

Muhammad 0

devout 0

Overall, 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
are 0
probably 0
some 0
decent 0
people, 0
but 0
those 0
in 0

issues, 0
but 0
that 0
is 0
something 0
for 0
the 0
people 0
there 0

with. 0

Iran 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
actual 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0

The 0

by 0
emphasizing 0
an 0

policy 0
of 0

something 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
opposed 0
when 0
popular 0

gripped 0
Iran 0
in 0
2009. 0

The 0
regime 0
change 0
plan 0
seeks 0
to 0
fundamentally 0
shift 0
U.S. 0
policy 0
towards 0
Iran 0
and 0
has 0
found 0
a 0
receptive 0
audience 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
moving 0
in 0
this 0
direction 0
since 0
Bolton—a 0
longtime 0
and 0
vocal 0
supporter 0
of 0
regime 0
change—entered 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Ah, 0
yes, 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

While 0
I 0
applaud 0
Bolton 0
for 0
his 0
willingness 0
to 0
call 0
Islamic 0
jihadis 0
just 0
that, 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
so 0
naive 0
as 0
to 0
consider 0
that 0
his 0
membership 0
in 0
the 0
Council 0
on 0
Foreign 0
Relations 0
has 0
no 0
effect 0
in 0
this 0
decision. 0

"The 0
ordinary 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
are 0
suffering 0
under 0
economic 0
stagnation, 0
while 0
the 0
regime 0
ships 0
its 0
wealth 0
abroad 0
to 0
fight 0
its 0
expansionist 0
wars 0
and 0
to 0
pad 0
the 0
bank 0
accounts 0
of 0
the 0
Mullahs 0
and 0
the 0
IRGC 0
command," 0
SSG 0
writes 0
in 0
the 0
paper. 0

"This 0
has 0
provoked 0
noteworthy 0
protests 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
in 0
recent 0
months." 0

Well, 0
why 0
is 0
that? 0

It's 0
due 0
to 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
the 0
US. 0

As 0
has 0
been 0
pointed 0
out 0
before, 0
sanctions 0
hurt 0
the 0
people, 0
not 0
the 0
governments 0
that 0
lead 0
them 0
and 0
then 0
those 0
same 0
governments 0
use 0
the 0
effects 0
to 0
propagandize 0
the 0
people 0
against 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
ordering 0
the 0
sanctions. 0

I'm 0
not 0
saying 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government 0
is 0
good, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
Iran's 0
government. 0

Honestly, 0
I 0
see 0
a 0
ton 0
of 0
corruption 0
and 0
warmongering 0
in 0
our 0
own 0
government 0
that 0
rivals 0
some 0
of 0
that 0
of 0
governments 0
that 0
America 0
stands 0
against. 0

Still, 0
as 0
was 0
pointed 0
out 0
by 0
Matt 0
Agorist, 0
Bolton 0
told 0
an 0
audience 0
of 0
the 0
Grand 0
Gathering 0
of 0
Iranians 0
for 0
Free 0
Iran: 0

“There 0
is 0
a 0
viable 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
the 0
ayatollahs, 0
and 0
that 0
opposition 0
is 0
centered 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
today. 0

I 0
had 0
said 0
for 0
over 0
10 0
years 0
since 0
coming 0
to 0
these 0
events, 0
that 0
the 0
declared 0
policy 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
should 0
be 0
the 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
mullahs’ 0
regime 0
in 0
Tehran. 0

The 0
behavior 0
and 0
the 0
objectives 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
change, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 1
only 1
solution 1
is 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
regime 0
itself. 0

And 0
that’s 0
why, 0
before 0
2019, 0
we 0
here 0
will 0
celebrate 0
in 0
Tehran!” 0

And 0
again, 0
this 0
really 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
US. 0

One 0
source 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
who 0
has 0
previewed 0
the 0
plan 0
told 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
that 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
also 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
solidified 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
grip 0
on 0
power 0
and 0
intentionally 0
prevented 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
from 0
fomenting 0
regime 0
change. 0

“The 0
JCPOA 0
purposefully 0
destroyed 0
the 0
carefully 0
created 0
global 0
consensus 0
against 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic,” 0
said 0
the 0
source, 0
who 0
would 0
only 0
speak 0
to 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
on 0
background 0
about 0
the 0
sensitive 0
issue. 0

“Prior 0
to 0
that, 0
everyone 0
understood 0
the 0
dangers 0
of 0
playing 0
footsie 0
with 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
state 0
sponsor 0
of 0
terrorism. 0

It’s 0
now 0
Trump, 0
Bolton, 0
and 0
[Mike] 0
Pompeo’s 0
job 0
to 0
put 0
this 0
consensus 0
back 0
in 0
place.” 0

The 0
source 0
told 0
the 0
Beacon 0
that 0
Bolton 0
is 0
“acutely 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
danger 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
poses 0
to 0
the 0
region.” 0

“John 0
is 0
someone 0
who 0
understands 0
the 0
danger 0
of 0
Iran 0
viscerally, 0
and 0
knows 0
that 0
you’re 0
never 0
going 0
to 0
fundamentally 0
change 0
its 0
behavior—and 0
the 0
threats 0
against 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Saudis 0
especially—until 0
that 0
revolutionary 0
regime 0
is 0
gone,” 0
the 0
source 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
“nothing’s 0
off 0
the 0
table 0
right 0
now 0
if 0
Israel 0
is 0
attacked.” 0

OK, 0
I 0
get 0
they 0
may 0
pose 0
a 0
danger, 0
but 0
let's 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
reality 0
here. 0

Those 0
they 0
pose 0
a 0
danger 0
to, 0
namely 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
and 0
Israel 0
can 0
both 0
fend 0
perfectly 0
well 0
for 0
themselves 0
and 0
have 0
demonstrated 0
that 0
ability 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
need 0
for 0
the 0
US 0
to 0
be 0
involved 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

Why 0
should 0
we 0
be 0
fighting 0
a 0
battle 0
or 0
encouraging, 0
funding, 0
and 0
I'm 0
quite 0
sure 0
arming, 0
a 0
rebellion? 0

Where 0
is 0
that 0
authorized 0
in 0
our 1
Constitution? 1

Simple. 0

It 0
isn't. 0

I 0
care 0
little 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
government 0
as 0
they 0
help 0
push 0
Sharia 0
and 0
is 0
the 0
land 0
where 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
9-11 0
hijackers 0
came 0
from. 0

The 0
Iranian 0
government 0
I 0
care 0
for 0
even 0
less, 0
but 0
out 0
of 0
each 0
of 0
those, 0
which 0
one 0
should 0
America 0
have 0
dealt 0
with 0
militarily 0
following 0
9-11? 0

Both, 0
if 0
you're 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
by 0
information 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
record 0
on. 0

Why 0
can't 0
America 0
focus 0
on 0
it's 0
own 0
issues 0
and 0
solve 0
those? 0

It's 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
too 0
busy 0
trying 0
to 0
police 0
the 0
world, 0
keeping 0
the 0
spotlight 0
off 0
of 0
those 0
in 0
our 0
government 0
who 0
are 0
attacking 0
our 0
rights 0
and 0
spending 0
us 0
into 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
debt. 0

And 0
lest 0
you 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
about 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

It 0
isn't. 0

“The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
it’s 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime,” 0
the 0
source 0
told 0
the 0
Beacon. 0

“Team 0
Bolton 0
has 0
spent 0
years 0
creating 0
Plans 0
B, 0
C, 0
and 0
D 0
for 0
dealing 0
with 0
that 0
problem. 0

President 0
Trump 0
hired 0
him 0
knowing 0
all 0
of 0
that. 0

The 0
administration 0
will 0
now 0
start 0
aggressively 1
moving 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
root 0
cause 0
of 0
chaos 0
and 0
violence 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
in 0
a 0
clear-eyed 0
way.” 0

Bolton 0
says 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
accomplished 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
six 0
months. 0

I 1
don't 1
doubt 1
it. 1

This 0
will 0
probably 0
end 0
up 0
being 0
another 0
Ukraine 0
situation, 0
something 0
we 0
just 0
don't 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
in, 0
and 0
yes, 0
I 0
know, 0
I'll 0
be 0
called 0
a 0
liberal 0
but 0
honest 1
readers 0
who 0
have 0
followed 0
me 0
for 0
some 0
time 0
know 0
that's 0
not 0
the 0
case. 0

Notice 0
some 0
things 0
that 0
are 0
taking 0
place 0
in 0
Iran 0
that 0
the 0
plan 0
speaks 0
about. 0

“More 0
than 0
one 0
third 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
population 0
is 0
minority 0
groups, 0
many 0
of 0
whom 0
already 0
seek 0
independence,” 0
the 0
paper 0
explains. 0

“U.S. 0

support 0
for 0
these 0
independence 0
movements, 0
both 0
overt 0
and 0
covert, 0
could 0
force 0
the 0
regime 0
to 0
focus 0
attention 0
on 0
them 0
and 0
limit 0
its 0
ability 0
to 0
conduct 0
other 0
malign 0
activities.” 0

“The 0
probability 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
theocracy 0
will 0
stop 0
its 0
nuclear 0
program 0
willingly 0
or 0
even 0
under 0
significant 0
pressure 0
is 0
low,” 0
the 0
plan 0
states. 0

“Absent 0
a 0
change 0
in 0
government 0
within 0
Iran, 0
America 1
will 1
face 1
a 1
choice 1
between 1
accepting 1
a 1
nuclear-armed 1
Iran 1
or 1
acting 1
to 1
destroy 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
this 1
capability 1
as 1
possible.” 1

President 0
Trump 0
did 0
made 0
clear 0
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
week 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
make 0
efforts 0
to 0
differentiate 0
between 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
ruling 0
regime. 0

Well, 0
I 0
agree, 0
but 0
that 0
gets 0
real 0
messy 0
when 0
you 0
start 0
intervening 0
in 0
this 0
manner. 0

“Any 0
public 0
discussion 0
of 0
these 0
options, 0
and 0
any 0
messaging 0
about 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
in 0
general, 0
should 0
make 0
a 0
bright 0
line 0
distinction 0
between 0
the 0
theocratic 0
regime 0
along 0
with 0
its 0
organs 0
of 0
oppression 0
and 0
the 0
general 0
populace,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
plan. 0

“We 0
must 0
constantly 0
reinforce 0
our 0
support 0
for 0
removing 0
the 0
iron 0
sandal 0
from 0
the 0
necks 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
to 0
allow 0
them 0
the 0
freedom 0
they 0
deserve.” 0

But 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
spoken 0
out 0
on 0
other 0
countries 0
where 0
the 0
people 0
want 0
their 0
independence. 0

Remember 0
the 0
Kurds? 0

How 0
about 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
Catalan 0
region 0
of 0
Spain? 0

No 0
support 0
for 0
those 0
people, 0
and 0
why? 0

Cause 0
it's 0
not 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
agenda. 0

I 0
say 0
if 0
the 0
Iranian 0
people 0
want 0
their 0
freedom, 0
let 0
them 0
first 0
free 0
themselves 0
from 0
the 0
bondage 0
of 0
Islam, 0
and 0
then 0
let 0
the 0
passion 0
that 0
burns 0
inside 0
men 0
to 0
be 0
free 0
rise 0
up 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
in 0
our 0
forefathers 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
teachings 0
fo 0
the 0
Holy 0
Scriptures 0
and 0
stand 0
and 0
fight. 0

Then, 0
