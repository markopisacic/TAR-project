The 0
media 0
very 1
deliberately 1
misreported 0
the 0
Bundy 0
standoff, 0
ridiculing 1
the 0
men 0
involved 0
and 0
shrugging 1
at 1
the 1
murder 1

When 0
the 0
court 0
case 0
completely 1
collapsed, 1
the 0
media 0
buried 0
the 0
story. 0

Just 0
as 0
it 0
failed 0
to 0
provide 0
any 0
meaningful 0
information 0
about 0
the 0
background 0
of 0
the 0
case. 0

That 0
was 0
in 0
part 0
because 1
it 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
damaging 1
to 1
Obama. 1

And 0
because 0
they 0
didn't 0
care. 0

But 0
President 0
Trump 0
listened 0
to 0
the 0
voices 0
asking 0
him 0
for 0
justice. 0

Today, 0

fire 0
that 0
leaked 0
onto 0
a 0
small 1
portion 0
of 0

land. 0

The 0
evidence 0
at 0
trial 0
regarding 0
the 0
Hammonds’ 0
responsibility 0
for 0
the 0
fire 0
was 0
conflicting, 0
and 0
the 0
jury 0
acquitted 0
them 0
on 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
charges. 0

At 0
the 0
Hammonds’ 0
original 0
sentencing, 0
the 0
judge 0
noted 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
respected 0
in 0
the 0
community 0
and 0
that 0
imposing 0
the 0
mandatory 0
minimum, 0
5-year 0
prison 0
sentence 0
would 0
“shock 1
the 1
conscience” 1

be 0
“grossly 1
disproportionate 1
to 1
the 1
severity” 1
of 0
their 0
conduct. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
the 0
judge 0
imposed 0
significantly 0
lesser 0
sentences. 0

The 0
previous 0
administration, 0
however, 0
filed 0
an 0

that 0
resulted 0
in 0
the 0
Hammonds 0
being 0
sentenced 0
to 0
five 0
years 0
in 0
prison. 0

This 0
was 0
unjust. 1

Dwight 0

that 0

a 0

on 0
certain 0

on 0

land. 0

The 0
length 0
of 0
their 0
prison 0
terms, 0
in 0

fueled 1
outrage 1
at 0
their 0
convictions. 0

Federal 0

Michael 0
Robert 0
Hogan 0
originally 0
gave 0
the 0
