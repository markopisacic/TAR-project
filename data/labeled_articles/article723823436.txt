there 0

"credible 1

If 0

On 0
Thursday 0
evening, 0
Representative 0
Scott 0
Perry 0
(R-PA) 0
appeared 0
on 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
tonight 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State 0
may 0
be 0
telling 0
the 0
truth 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
actually 0
have 0
been 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
deadly 0
attack. 0

Perry 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
can't 0
seem 0
to 0
get 0
information 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
the 0
public 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
aware 0
of, 0
something 0
that 0
was 0
brought 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
district 0
courtroom 0
earlier 0
this 0
week. 0

Additionally, 0
the 0
family 0
of 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
just 0
received 0
his 0
cremated 0
remains 0
on 0
Thursday 0
and 0
his 0
brother 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
family 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
receive 0
an 0
autopsy 0
report. 0

Why 0
is 0
that? 0

Everyone 0
who 0
was 0
killed 0
that 0
night 0
had 0
autopsies 0
and 0
those 0
have 0
been 0
released. 0

We're 0
told 0
Paddock 0
shot 0
himself 0
in 0
the 0
head, 0
right? 0

Why 1
would 1
the 1
autopsy 1
report 1
be 1
something 1
that 1
needs 1
to 1
be 1
withheld 1
from 1
the 1
public 1
or 1
his 1
family? 1

"Recently 0
I’ve 0
been 0
made 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
I 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 1
evidence 1
regarding 0
potential 0
terrorist 0
infiltration 0
through 0
the 0
southern 0
border 0
regarding 0
this 0
incident," 0
Perry 0
said. 0

"Twice 0
before 0
the 0
attack, 0
ISIS 0
warned 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
they 0
would 0
attack 0
Las 0
Vegas," 0
he 0
added. 0

"In 0
June 0
and 0
August." 0

"And 0
then 0
after 0
the 0
attack 0
claimed 0
responsibility 0
four 0
times," 0
Perry 0
continued. 0

"Something’s 1
not 1
adding 1
up." 1

"I’m 0
just 0
telling 0
you 0
I 0
have 0
received 0
what 0
I 0
feel 0
to 0
be 0
and 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
possible 0
terrorist 0
nexus," 0
Perry 0
said. 0

The 0
investigation 0
has 0
been 0
conducted 0
by 0
local 0
and 0
state 0
police, 0
not 0
the 0
feds, 0
and 0
yet, 0
they 0
continue 0
to 0
claim 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
Islamic 0
terrorist 0
involvement. 0

Yet, 0
though 0
they 0
claim 0
that 0
Paddock 0
was 0
a 0
lone 0
gunman, 0
they 0
continue 0
to 0
withhold 0
video 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
still 0
investigating 0
other 0
suspects 0
to 0
charge 0
in 0
the 0
shooting. 0

And 0
no 0
one 0
seems 0
to 0
know 0
where 0
alleged 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
guard 0
Jesus 0
Campos 0
is 0
either. 0

None 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
really 0
that 0
surprising. 0

If 0
you 0
recall, 0
we 0
reported 0
on 0
Islamic 0
terrorists 0
settling 0
into 0
Mexico 0
and 0
crossing 0
the 0
border 0
some 0
years 0
back 0
and 0
that 0
came 0
out 0
as 0
the 0
infamous 0
"Gang 0
of 0
Eight" 0
were 0
working 0
on 0
an 0
immigration 0
deal 0
and 0
had 0
rejected 0
building 0
the 0
700 0
miles 0
of 0
double-tier 0
border 0
fencing 0
Congress 0
authorized 0
just 0
seven 0
years 0
ago, 0
with 0
a 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
saying 0
they 0
didn't 0
want 0
to 0
delay 0
granting 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
legal 0
status 0
while 0
the 0
fence 0
was 0
being 0
built. 0

Three 0
years 0
prior 0
to 0
that 0
report, 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
video 0
report 0
that 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
provided 0
a 0
bit 0
of 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
Islamists 0
were 0
crossing 0
our 0
southern 0
border. 0

And 0
even 0
though 0
Islamic 0
jihadis 0
have 0
been 0
apprehended 0
on 0
our 0
border 0
in 0
2014, 0
the 0
Homeland 0
Security 0
waved 0
their 0
hand 0
and 0
said, 0
"There's 1
no 1
threat." 1

In 0
fact, 0
DHS 0
had 0
denied 0
Muslim 0
terrorists 0
were 0
crossing 0
the 0
border, 0
but 0
a 0
local 0
investigator 0
produced 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary. 0

Reports 0
indicated 0
that 0
some 0
jihadis 0
were 0
paying 0
as 0
much 0
as 0
$50,000 0
to 0
get 0
across 0
the 0
border. 0

This 0
has 0
been 0
documented 0
for 0
several 0
years 0
now. 0

It's 0
not 0
surprising. 0

What 1
is 1
surprising 1
is 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
secrecy 1
surrounding 1
the 1
Las 1
Vegas 1
shooting 1
and 1
the 1
containment 1
of 1
information 1
more 1
than 1
three 1
months 1
after 1
it 1
occurred. 1
