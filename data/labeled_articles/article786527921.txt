claiming 0
she 0

at 0

in 0
non-partisan 1
activities 1
not 0
designed 0

undercut 1
her 1

to 1

using 1
Google 1
products 1
with 1
official 1
company 1

The 0
critical 1
miscalculation, 1
Murillo 1
wrote 1
in 1
a 1
stunning 1
admission 1
in 0
the 0
email, 0
was 0
that 0
Latino 0
voters 0
backed 0

by 0
higher 0
margins 0
than 0
any 0

had 0
forecast 0

Trump’s 0
29 0
percent 0

numbers—about 0
31 0
percent—in 0
the 0
key 0
battleground 0
state 0
of 0

Murillo 0
admitted. 0

Murillo 0
wrote 0
at 0
the 0
outset 0
of 0
the 0
lengthy 0
message: 0

We 0
worked 0
very 0
hard. 0

Many 0
people 0
did. 0

We 0
pushed 0
tp 0
get 0
out 0
the 0
Latino 0
vote 0
with 0
our 0
features, 0
our 0
partners, 0
and 0
our 0
voices. 0

We 0
kept 0
our 0
Google 0
efforts 0
non-partisan 1
and 0
followed 0
our 0
company’s 0
protocols 0
for 0
the 0
elections 0
strategy. 0

We 0
emphasized 0
our 0
mission 0
to 0
give 0
Latinos 0
access 0
to 0
information 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
can 0
make 0
an 0
informed 0
decision 0
at 0
the 0
polls, 0
and 0
we 0
feel 0
very 0
grateful 0
for 0
all 0
the 0
support 0
to 0
do 0
this 0
important 0
work. 0

Latinos 0
voted 1
in 1
record-breaking 1
numbers, 1
particularly 0
with 0
early 0
votes. 0

A 0
large 0
percentage 0
of 0
Latino 0
voters 0
in 0
Florida 0
were 0
new 0
voters 0
who 0
had 0
become 0
citizens 0
just 0
in 0
time 0
to 0
vote. 0

We 0
saw 0
high 0
traffic 0
for 0
the 0
search 0
queries 0
‘votar,’ 0
‘como 0
votar,’ 0
and 0
‘donde 0
voter,’ 0
in 0
key 0
states 0
like 0

Nevada. 0

We 0
will 0
be 0
pulling 0
in 0
more 0
info 0
in 0
the 0
coming 0
hours/days 0
but 0
so 0
far 0
we 0
definitely 0
know 0
there 0
was 0
high 0
traffic 0
on 0
search 0
in 0
Spanish. 0

Without 0
translating 0
our 0
tools 0
the 0
users 0
wouldn’t 0
have 0
found 0
the 0
information 0
they 0
needed. 0

Objectively 0
speaking, 0
our 0
goal 0
was 0
met 0
— 0
we 0
pushed 0
and 0
successfully 0
launched 0
the 0
search 0

in 0
Spanish, 0
and 0
we 0
thank 0
Lisa 0
for 0
her 0

for 0
this 0

I 0
sent 0

their 0

this 0

and 0
we 0
greatly 0

it. 0

Even 0
Sundar 0
gave 0
the 0
effort 0
a 0
shout 0
out 0
and 0
a 0
comment 0
in 0
Spanish, 0
which 0
was 0

an 1

on 1

who 1

in 1
Carlson’s 1

“Google 1
alone 1

the 1
outcome 1

almost 1
any 1

just 1
by 1
altering 1
its 1

how 0
Google 0

the 0

Breitbart 0
News 0
has 0
exclusively 0
published 0
several 0
of 0
Epstein’s 0
reports, 0
including 0
a 0
recent 0
one 0
showing 0
that 0
Google 0

huge 1
swaths 1
of 1

In 0
his 0

Carlson 0
then 0
described 0
the 0
emails 0
he 0
obtained, 0
which 0
Breitbart 0
News 0
also 0
obtained. 0

Carlson 0
said: 0

This 0
wasn’t 0
a 0
get-out-the-vote 1
effort 1
or 0
whatever 0
they 0
say. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
aimed 0
at 0
all 0
potential 0
voters. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
even 0
aimed 0
at 0
a 0
balanced 0
cross-section 0
of 0
subgroups. 0

Google 0
didn’t 0
try 0
to 0
get 0
out 0
the 0
vote 0
among 0
say 0
Christian 0
Arabs 0
in 0
Michigan 0
or 0
say 0
Persian 0
Jews 0
in 0
Los 0
Angeles—they 0
sometimes 0
vote 0
Republican. 0

It 0
was 0
aimed 0
only 0
at 0
one 0
group, 0
a 0
group 0
that 0
Google 0
cynically 1
assumed 1
would 0
vote 0
exclusively 0
for 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Furthermore, 0
this 0

not 0
only 0
the 0
entire 0
country 0
but 0
swing 0
states 0

to 0
the 0
Hillary 0
campaign. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
an 0
exercise 0
in 0
civics, 0
this 0
was 0
political 0
consulting. 0

It 0
was 0
in 0
effect 0
an 0
in-kind 0
contribution 0
to 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
campaign.” 0

Carlson 0
noted 0
that 0
in 0
communication 0
with 0
Google, 0
the 0
company 0
“did 0
not 0
deny 0
that 0
the 0
email 0
was 0
real 0
or 0
that 0
it 0
showed 0
a 0
clear 0
political 0
preference.” 0

“Their 0
only 0
defense 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
activities 0
they 0
described 0
were 0
either 0
non-partisan 1
or 0
were 0
not 0
officially 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
company,” 0
Carlson 0
said 0
Monday 0
night, 0
describing 0
Google’s 0
official 0
response 0
to 0
his 0
requests 0
for 0
comment, 0
before 0
challenging 0
the 0
company’s 0
response: 0
“But 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
were 1
both. 1

Plenty 0
of 0
people 0
in 0
Google 0
knew 0
what 0
was 0
going 0
on 0
and 0
we 0
haven’t 0

anyone 0

The 0

from 0
Murillo 0
continues 0
by 0
explaining 0
just 0
how 0
expansive 0
the 0
efforts 0
the 0
company 0
undertook 0
to 0
achieve 0
its 0
objective 0
were: 0

We 0
had 0
our 0
partners 0
help 0
spread 0
the 0
word 0
about 0
our 0
features 0
on 0
social 0

about 0

Latino 0
vote 0
and 0
the 0
new 0

published 0
about 0
the 0
Latino 0
electorate. 0

This 0
reached 0
4.4M 0
social 0

signaled 0
to 0
many 0
that 0
Google 0
and 0
our 0
partners 0
value 0
the 0
Latino 0
community 0
and 0
our 0
role 0
in 0
this 0
election. 0

We 0
brought 0
the 0
same 0
research 0
to 0
the 0
LATISM 0
conference, 0
where 0
people 0
were 0
beyond 1
thrilled 1
to 0
see 0
Google’s 0

acknowledgment 0
of 0
the 0
Latino 0
community. 0

If 0
Murillo 0
had 0
ended 0
her 0

there, 0
this 0
probably 0
would 0
not 0
amount 0
to 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
a 0
national 0
news 0

But 0
she 0
did 0
not: 0
She 0
went 0
on 0
for 0
another 0
several 0
paragraphs 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
page 0
and 0
an 0
extra 0
three 0
pages 0
to 0
admit 0
the 1
openly 1
partisan 1
intent 1
of 1
Google’s 1
actions, 1
including 0
a 0
remarkable 0
in-writing 0
confirmation 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
Google’s 0
actions 0
amounted 0
to 0
a 1
“silent 1

that 0
could 0
raise 0
Federal 0

red 0

if 0

into 0
this 0

now 0
that 0
these 0

have 0
been 0
publicly 0
revealed. 0

It 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
paragraph 0
that 0
Murillo 0
openly 0
admits 0
that 0
Google 0
made 0
a 1
“silent 1

in 0
her 0
words, 0
paying 0
for 0

Murillo 0
wrote 0
in 0
the 0
next 0

The 0
next 0
paragraph 0
is 0
where 0
Murillo 0
begins 0
to 0
make 0
her 0
next 0
major 0
admission: 0
that 0

in 0

us 0
the 0

In 1
the 1
next 1

Murillo 1
again 1
openly 1
admits 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
“objective” 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
the 1
election. 1

“I 0
have 0

I 0
ask 0
that 0
you 0
please 0
give 0
us 0
some 0
time 0
to 0
pause 0
and 0
reflect,” 0
Murillo 0
wrote. 0

“This 1
is 1
devastating 1
for 0
our 0
Democratic 0
Latino 0
community. 0

After 0
all 0
these 0

and 0
what 0
we 0
thought 0
was 0
positive 0
momentum 0
toward 0
change, 0
the 0
results 0
are 0
not 0
what 0
we 0
expected 0
at 0
all. 0

We 0
are 0
afraid 0
for 0
our 0

of 0
the 0
effort 0
by 0

its 0

is 0
afraid 0
of 0
secret 1
pro-Trump 1

on 0

created. 0

She 0
also 0
admits 0
ongoing 0

among 0
these 0

about 0

give 1

after 0

her 1
on 1

She 0
also 0
says 0
those 0

Google’s 0
get-out-the-vote 0

that 0
