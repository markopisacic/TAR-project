Can 0
the 0
Church 0
Defend 0
Herself 0
Against 0
Bergoglio? 0

Fisher 0
is 0
rightly 1
incensed 1
by 0
Bergoglio’s 0
cunning 1
response, 0
“I 0
will 0
not 0
say 0
a 0
single 0
word 0
on 0
this 0
, 0
” 0
concerning 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
damning 1
indictment 1
of 0
Bergoglio’s 0
rehabilitation 0
of 0
the 1
monster 1
once 1
known 1
as 1
Cardinal 1
McCarrick 1
for 0
some 0
five 0
years 0
before 0
adverse 0
worldwide 0
press 0
coverage 0
forced 0
to 0
him 0
to 0
punish 0
that 1
serial 1
homosexual 1
rapist 1
of 0
whose 0
crimes 0
Viganò 0
had 0
personally 0
informed 0
him 0
back 0
in 0
2013—information 0
of 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
was 0
clearly 0
already 0
aware 0
at 0
that 0
time, 0
as 0
Viganò 0
testifies. 0

I 0
never 0
thought 0
I’d 0
see 0
the 0
day 0
when 0
a 1
preening, 1
Internet-created 1
neo-Catholic 1
doyenne 1
such 0
as 0
Simcha 0
Fisher, 0
as 0
notorious 0
as 0
Mark 0
Shea 0
for 0
her 0
crude 1
and 1
often 1
unprintable 1
invective 1
against 0
traditionalists, 0
would 0
unload 1
on 1
Pope 1
Bergoglio 1
with 0
the 0
following 0
headline: 0
“Does 1
Francis 1
know 1
he 1
sounds 1
like 1
an 1
abuser?” 1

The 0
scales 0
have 0
fallen 0
from 0
Fisher’s 0
eyes 0
and 0
now, 0
at 0
last, 0
she 0
sees 0
Bergoglio, 0
however 0
grudgingly, 0
for 0
what 0
he 0
is: 0
a 1
power-mad 1
ecclesiastical 1
tyrant. 1

(A 0
tyrant, 0
moreover, 0
who 0
has 0
ascended 0
to 0
the 0
papacy 0
in 0
a 0
manner 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
the 0
ascension 0
of 0
the 1
corrupt 1
Benedict 1
IX, 1
another 0
“disgrace 1
to 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter,” 1
following 0
the 0
machinations 0
of 0
a 0
Roman 0
cabal, 0
as 0
I 0
discuss 0
below.) 0

Quoth 0
Fisher: 0

I 0
have 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
friends 0
who 0
have 0
escaped 0
abusive 0
marriages. 0

They 0
tell 0
me 0
that 0
Pope 1
Francis 1
is 1
sounding 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
like 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
abused 1
them. 1

He’s 1
sounding 1
like 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
hid 1
that 1
abuse 1
from 1
the 1
world, 1
who 1
taught 1
their 1
victims 1
to 1
blame 1
themselves, 1
who 1
used 1
spiritual 1
pressure 1
to 1
persuade 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
families 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
actually 1
be 1
wrong, 1
sinful, 1
to 1
defend 1
themselves. 1

Just 0
listen 0
to 0
him. 0

After 0
responding 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
about 0
Vigano’s 0
very 0
serious 0
accusations, 0
he 0
said 0
point 0
blank, 0
“I 0
will 0
not 0
say 0
a 0
single 0
word 0
on 0
this.”… 0
[F]or 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
week 0
and 0
more, 0
he 0
kept 0
up 0
an 0
unmistakable 0
theme 0
of 0
calling 0
for 0
silence, 0
equating 0
silence 0
with 0
holiness, 0
and 0
painting 0
himself 0
as 0
a 1
Christlike 1
victim 1
in 0
his 0
silence. 0

Then 0
he 0
says 0
it’s 0
“ugly” 0
to 0
accuse 0
others 0
of 0
sinning. 0

Then 0
he 0
suggests 0
that 0
healing 1
and 1
reconciliation 1
will 1
only 1
come 1
if 1
we 1
take 1
a 1
hard 1
look 1
at 1
our 1
own 1
flaws…. 1

To 1
the 1
victims 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
and 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
love 1
them, 1
it 1
sounds 1
like 1
he 1
is 1
saying, 1
“Who 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
are? 1

I 1
don’t 1
have 1
to 1
explain 1
myself 1
to 1
you. 1

You’re 1
the 1
guilty 1
one. 1

You 1
brought 1
this 1
on 1
yourself. 1

If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
loved, 1
then 1
know 1
your 1
place. 1

I’m 1
the 1
victim, 1
here, 1
not 1
you. 1

If 1
you 1
know 1
what’s 1
good 1
for 1
you, 1
keep 1
your 1
mouth 1
shut.” 1
This 1
is 1
how 1
abusers 1
talk. 1

They’re 1
not 1
content 1
with 1
power; 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
keep 1
their 1
victims 1
doubting 1
and 1
blaming 1
themselves 1
constantly, 1
so 1
they 1
don’t 1
become 1
a 1
threat. 1

Whether 1
Francis 1
knows 1
it 1
or 1
not, 1
this 1
is 1
how 1
he 1
sounds. 1

We 0
can 0
overlook 0
the 0
fig 0
leaf 0
“whether 0
Francis 0
knows 0
it 0
or 0
not…”. 0

Fisher 1
knows 1
that 1
Francis 1
knows 1
it, 1
even 1
if 1
she 1
still 1
cannot 1
bring 1
herself 1
to 1
say 1
explicitly 1
what 1
should 1
now 1
be 1
apparent 1
to 1
the 1
entire 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
faithful: 1
that 0
Bergoglio’s 1
very 1
presence 1
on 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter 1
is 1
a 1
grave 1
threat 1
to 1
the 1
common 1
good 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
and 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
Faith. 1

Yet 0
Fisher 0
maintains 0
a 0
sliver 0
of 0
space 0
for 0
deniability 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
maintain 0
that 0
indispensable 0
distinction 0
between 0
her 0
and 0
those 1
loathsome 1
traditionalists: 1
“I 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
ideological 0
reason 0
to 0
want 0
to 0
bring 0
him 0
down. 0

I 0
have 0
defended 0
him 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
I 0
could, 0
up 0
until 0
the 0
Chile 0
debacle. 0

And 0
so 0
I 0
am 0
working 0
as 0
hard 0
as 0
I 0
can 0
not 0
to 0
assume 0
the 0
worst, 0
not 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
this 1
man 1
who 1
promised 1
so 1
much 1
fresh 1
air 1
is 1
really 1
so 1
intent 1
on 1
slamming 1
doors 1
shut 1
before 1
we 1
find 1
out 1
even 1
worse 1
things 1
hidden 1
inside. 1

But 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
making 1
it 1
easy. 1

I 1
am 1
not 1
saying 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
abuser. 1

But 1
he 1
sounds 1
like 1
one.” 1

That 0
is, 0
Fisher 0
was 0
not 0
concerned 0
about 0
Bergoglio’s 0
relentless 1
assault 1
on 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
and 0
practice—to 0
her, 0
opposition 0
to 0
Francis 0
on 0
that 0
account 0
is 0
just 0
“ideology”—but 0
only 0
his 0
role 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests. 0

But 0
why 0
is 0
Fisher 0
still 0
“working 0
hard 0
not 0
to 0
assume 0
the 0
worst” 0
when 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
anything 0
to 0
assume 0
as 0
the 0
ever-mounting 0
evidence 0
of 0
malintent 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
plain 0
view 0
for 0
years? 0

Indeed, 0
why 0
else 0
did 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
risk 1
everything 1
in 0
order 0
to 0
expose 0
this 0
Pope, 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
extent 0
of 0
revealing 0
matters 0
supposedly 0
within 0
the 0
scope 0
of 0
“the 0
Pontifical 0
secret”? 0

On 0
orders 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
the 0
Vatican 0
secret 0
police 0
are 0
reportedly 0
scouring 0
the 0
globe 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
Viganò, 0
who 0
has 0
gone 0
into 0
hiding, 0
“in 0
order 0
to 0
prevent 0
more 0
unpredictable 0
damage 0
to 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
on 0
the 0
world 0
stage, 0
but 0
also 0
to 0
‘prepare 0
the 0
terrain’ 0
for 0
the 1
former 1
apostolic 1
nuncio-turned-whistleblower 1
to 0
be 0
prosecuted” 0
under 0
canon 0
law. 0

The 1
Dictator 1
Pope 1
must 0
destroy 0
his 0
most 0
potent 0
critic 0
thus 0
far. 0

Everything 1
depends 1
on 1
it! 1

But 0
it 0
may 0
already 0
be 0
too 0
late 0
to 0
save 0
a 0
regime 0
whose 0
only 0
defense 0
is 0
not 0
truth 0
but 0
raw 0
power. 0

At 0
last 0
count, 0
some 0
29 0
bishops 0
have 0
publicly 0
declared 0
Viganò’s 0
allegations 0
against 0
Bergoglio 0
credible 0
and 0
worthy 0
of 0
investigation. 0

Now 0
even 0
the 0
distinguished 0
canonist 0
Edward 0
Peters, 0
who 0
is 0
no 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
Referendary 0
of 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura 0
appointed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
declares 0
that 0
if 0
Viganò’s 0
allegations 0
are 0
true 0
then 0
Bergoglio 0
must 0
go: 0

Of 0
what 0
was 0
said 0
above 0
concerning 0
resignation 0
from 0
Church 0
office 0
in 0
general, 0
what 0
would 0
not 0
apply 0
to 0
a 0
pope, 0
of 0
all 0
office 0
holders, 0
if 0
he, 0
as 0
alleged 0
by 0
Viganò, 0
from 0
the 0
first 0
months 0
of 0
his 0
papacy 0
knowingly 0
protected 0
and 0
favored 0
a 0
cardinal 0
who 0
was 0
[pick 0
a 0
disgusting 0
verb]-ing 0
seminarians? 0

By 1
what 1
possible 1
stretch 1
of 1
the 1
imagination 1
would 1
such 1
an 1
occupant 1
be 1
suited 1
for 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter? 1

Does 0
the 0
historical 0
fact 0
that 0
some 0
pretty 0
bad 0
popes 0
held 0
on 0
to 0
office 0
despite 0
committing 0
various 0
offenses 0
justify 0
other 0
popes 0
acting 0
badly 0
in 0
shirking 0
even 0
the 0
minimal 0
gesture 0
of 0
resigning? 0

Viganò 0
is 0
unquestionably 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
know, 0
and 0
claims 0
to 0
know, 0
whether 0
his 0
central 0
allegation 0
that 0
Francis’ 0
was 1
covering 1
for 1
McCarrick, 1
big 1
time, 1
for 0
years, 0
is 0
correct. 0

Believing, 0
as 0
he 0
does, 0
that 0
his 0
claims 0
are 0
correct, 0
Viganò, 0
in 0
calling 0
for 0
Francis’ 0
resignation, 0
has 0
done 0
nothing 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
than 0
exercise 0
his 0
right 0
under 0
canon 0
law 0
“to 0
manifest 0
to 0
the 0
sacred 0
pastors 0
[his] 0
opinion 0
on 0
matters 0
which 0
pertain 0
to 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
to 0
make 0
[his] 0
opinion 0
known 0
to 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
Christian 0
faithful…” 0
1983 0
CIC 0
212 0
§ 0
3. 0

I 0
have 0
not 0
called 0
for 0
Francis’ 0
resignation 0
because 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
(with 0
the 0
degree 0
of 0
certitude 0
that 0
a 0
lawyer 0
seeks) 0
whether 0
Viganò’s 0
key 0
allegations 0
against 0
Francis 0
are 0
substantially 0
true; 0
most 0
assuredly, 0
however, 0
if 0
I 0
reach 0
the 0
conclusion 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
true, 0
I 0
would 0
say, 0
without 0
hesitation, 0
that 0
Francis 0
should 0
resign. 0

Bergoglio 1
will 1
not, 1
of 1
course, 1
resign. 1

He 1
will 1
cling 1
to 1
power 1
with 1
his 1
last 1
breath 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
the 1
many 1
other 1
acts 1
of 1
ecclesial 1
subversion 1
he 1
clearly 1
has 1
in 1
mind. 1

The 0
only 0
remedies 0
for 0
the 1
plague 1
of 1
Bergoglio 1
are 0
his 0
natural 0
death 0
or 0
deposition. 0

Yes, 0
deposition. 0

Canon212 0
has 0
linked 0
to 0
an 0
interesting 0
and 0
timely 0
piece 0
on 0
the 0
role 0
of 0
the 0
Synod 0
of 0
Sutri, 0
near 0
Rome, 0
in 0
1046, 0
which 0
dealt 0
with 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
three 0
rival 0
claimants 0
to 0
the 0
papacy, 0
each 0
installed 0
by 0
a 0
Roman 0
faction: 0
First, 0
the 1
execrable 1
Benedict 1
IX, 1
mentioned 0
above. 0

Second, 0
the 1
interloper 1
Sylvester 1
III, 1
installed 0
in 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
Peter 0
after 0
Benedict 0
had 0
been 0
driven 0
from 0
Rome. 0

Third, 0
the 1
well-intentioned 1
but 1
dimwitted 1
Gregory 1
VI, 1
whose 0
election 0
was 0
tainted 0
by 0
a 0
seemingly 0
simoniacal 0
negotiation 0
with 0
Benedict, 0
who 0
had 0
returned 0
to 0
Rome 0
in 0
1045 0
and 0
ousted 0
Sylvester, 0
according 0
to 0
which 0
Benedict 0
would 0
receive 0
a 0
generous 0
pension 0
if 0
he 0
resigned 0
the 0
papacy, 0
which 0
Benedict 0
did 0
only 0
to 0
rescind 0
his 0
resignation. 0

The 0
Synod 0
was 0
convoked 0
by 0
Henry 0
III, 0
the 0
German 0
king 0
and 0
soon-to-be-crowned 0
Holy 0
Roman 0
Emperor, 0
a 1
pious 1
and 1
austere 1
Christian 1
and 1
an 1
exponent 1
of 1
the 1
Cluniac 1
spirit 1
of 1
reform. 1

The 0
Synod 0
declared 0
that 0
Benedict 0
IX 0
(who 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
appear) 0
was 0
deposed 0
notwithstanding 0
his 0
attempt 0
to 0
undo 0
his 0
resignation. 0

As 0
for 0
Sylvester, 0
the 0
Synod 0
declared 0
that 0
he 0
be 0
“stripped 1
of 1
his 1
sacerdotal 1
rank 1
and 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
monastery.” 1
Gregory 0
was 0
also 0
declared 0
deposed, 0
either 0
by 0
the 0
act 0
of 0
the 0
Synod 0
itself 0
or 0
by 0
Gregory’s 0
own 0
voluntary 0
resignation 0
in 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
Synod. 0

At 0
Henry 0
III’s 0
designation, 0
the 0
German 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Bamberg 0
became 0
Clement 0
II, 0
but 0
he 0
died 0
after 0
only 0
a 0
year, 0
whereupon 0
Benedict 0
reasserted 0
his 0
claim 0
to 0
the 0
papacy 0
for 0
the 0
third 0
time 0
in 0
1047, 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
driven 0
from 0
Rome 0
again 0
by 0
Imperial 0
troops 0
in 0
1048. 0

Damasus 0
II, 0
another 0
German 0
bishop 0
designated 0
by 0
Henry, 0
reigned 0
for 0
a 0
mere 0
three 0
weeks 0
before 0
dying, 0
whereupon 0
Pope 0
St. 0
Leo 0
IX 0
succeeded 0
to 0
the 0
papacy, 0
reigning 0
until 0
1054. 0

Leo, 0
as 0
John 0
Rao 0
observes, 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
in 0
a 0
line 0
of 0
Popes 0
who 0
“took 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
movement 0
of 0
innovative 0
Christian 0
restoration” 0
which 0
included 0
a 0
breaking 0
of 0
the 0
dominance 0
of 0
Roman 0
nobility 0
over 0
papal 0
elections. 0

(Rao, 0
Black 0
Legends, 0
147-148). 0

As 0
the 0
cited 0
article 0
on 0
the 0
Synod 0
of 0
Sutri 0
notes, 0
although 0
the 1
scurrilous 1
Benedict 1
IX 1
objected 0
to 0
his 0
deposition 0
by 0
the 0
Synod, 0
“the 0
Church 0
has 0
always 0
accepted 0
his 0
deposition 0
as 0
valid. 0

The 0
King 0
of 0
Germany 0
then 0
appointed 0
Clement 0
II 0
as 0
Pope, 0
who 0
promptly 0
crowned 0
the 0
King, 0
Holy 0
Roman 0
Emperor. 0

Benedict 0
IX, 0
after 0
the 0
death 0
of 0
Clement, 0
claimed 0
the 0
papacy 0
again! 0

The 0
Church 0
to 0
this 0
day 0
recognizes 0
Clement 0
II 0
as 0
a 0
true 0
Pope.” 0

Moreover, 0
Benedict 0
IX 0
himself 0
is 0
recognized 0
as 0
a 0
true 0
Pope—a 0
valid 0
but 0
deposed 0
Pope—during 0
three 0
separate 0
periods 0
listed 0
as 0
three 0
distinct 0
pontificates 0
in 0
the 0
canon 0
of 0
Popes. 0

This 0
was 0
possible 0
owing 0
to 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
any 0
set 0
canonical 0
form 0
for 0
papal 0
elections; 0
a 0
Pope 0
could 0
gain 0
or 0
regain 0
the 0
office 0
by 0
various 0
machinations. 0

Indeed, 0
even 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
own 0
website 0
states 0
that 0
Benedict 0
was 0
Pope 0
from 0
1047-1048, 0
the 0
very 0
year 0
of 0
his 0
third 0
ascension 0
to 0
the 0
office 0
from 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
finally 0
driven 0
by 0
force. 0

Only 0
with 0
the 0
ascension 0
of 0
Pope 0
Nicholas 0
II 0
in 0
1059 0
was 0
it 0
established 0
that 0
henceforth 0
the 0
cardinal-bishops 0
would 0
elect 0
the 0
Pope, 0
with 0
the 0
other 0
cardinals 0
having 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
confirm 0
or 0
veto 0
the 0
nominee. 0

By 0
1100 0
what 0
we 0
now 0
know 0
as 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals, 0
embracing 0
all 0
the 0
cardinals 0
of 0
different 0
titles, 0
had 0
the 0
exclusive 0
right 0
to 0
elect 0
a 0
Pope, 0
and 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
College 0
“have 0
held 0
it 0
ever 0
since.” 0
(Eric 0
John, 0
The 0
Popes, 0
181). 0

These 0
lessons 0
of 0
history 0
should 0
suffice 0
to 1
dispel 1
the 1
pious 1
fable, 1
never 0
a 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Magisterium, 0
that 0
every 0
Pope 0
is 0
chosen 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
Ghost 0
to 0
lead 0
the 0
Church. 0

This 0
theological 0
error, 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
has 1
exploited 1
to 1
the 1
hilt, 1
is 0
a 0
key 0
element 0
in 0
the 0
related 0
error 0
of 0
papalotry, 0
which 0
elevates 0
the 0
person 0
of 0
the 0
Pope 0
above 0
the 0
office 0
he 0
occupies 0
and 0
makes 0
of 0
him 0
the 1
leader 1
of 1
a 1
personality 1
cult 1
everyone 1
is 1
commanded 1
to 1
“love” 1
(in 1
the 1
superficially 1
emotional 1
sense) 1
and 1
obey 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
or 1
does, 1
rather 0
than 0
a 1
custodian 1
and 1
defender 1
of 1
the 1
Deposit 1
of 1
Faith 1
whose 1
lovability, 1
personality 1
and 1
opinions 1
are 1
utterly 1
irrelevant 1
to 1
the 1
exercise 1
and 1
scope 1
of 1
his 1
office. 1

As 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
has 0
observed, 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
a 0
Pope 0
“the 0
Spirit’s 0
role 0
should 0
be 0
understood 0
in 0
a 0
much 0
more 0
elastic 0
sense, 0
not 0
that 0
he 0
[sic] 0
dictates 0
the 0
candidate 0
for 0
whom 0
one 0
must 0
vote…. 0

There 1
are 1
too 1
many 1
contrary 1
instances 1
of 1
popes 1
the 1
Holy 1
Spirit 1
obviously 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
picked!” 1
Bergoglio 1
is 1
undeniably 1
one 1
of 1
them. 1

So 0
what 0
can 0
be 0
done 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Church 0
against 0
Bergoglio? 0

That 0
the 0
mode 0
of 0
papal 0
election 0
by 0
cardinals 0
has 0
persisted 0
for 0
nearly 0
a 0
thousand 0
years 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
general 0
impression 0
that 0
it 0
pertains 0
to 0
the 0
irreformable 0
divine 0
constitution 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
but 0
it 0
certainly 0
does 0
not. 0

As 0
to 0
matters 0
of 0
purely 0
ecclesiastical 0
law 0
such 0
as 0
this 0
one 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
always 0
allowed 0
for 0
departures 0
from 0
traditional 0
practice 0
in 0
cases 0
of 0
emergency 0
or 0
grave 0
necessity. 0

And 0
just 0
as 0
a 0
synod 0
was 0
employed 0
to 0
address 0
three 0
rival 0
claimants 0
to 0
the 0
papal 0
throne 0
in 0
1046, 0
declaring 0
at 0
least 0
two 0
of 0
them 0
deposed, 0
so 0
today 0
might 0
it 0
be 0
possible 0
for 0
reform-minded 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops, 0
comprising 0
an 0
imperfect 0
council, 0
to 0
undo 0
the 1
incalculable 1
damage 1
caused 0
by 0
the 0
cabal 0
that 0
lobbied 0
for 0
Bergoglio’s 0
election 0
before 0
the 0
last 0
conclave—a 0
cabal 0
that 0
included 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
McCarrick, 0
whom 0
Bergoglio 0
rewarded 0
by 0
rehabilitating 0
that 1
monster 1
despite 0
the 1
massive 1
evidence 1
of 1
his 1
unspeakable 1
crimes. 1

What 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
grounds 0
for 0
a 0
declaration 0
of 0
deposition 0
at 0
such 0
a 0
gathering 0
of 0
prelates? 0

One 0
could 0
readily 0
point 0
to 0
the 0
evidence 0
that 0
a 0
faction 0
that 0
included 0
Bergoglio 0
himself 0
had 0
agreed 0
upon 0
his 0
election 0
before 0
the 0
conclave, 0
and 0
that 0
all 0
those 0
involved, 0
including 0
Bergoglio, 0
were 0
thereby 0
excommunicated 0
latae 0
sententiae 0
in 1
accordance 1
with 1
Article 1
81 1
of 1
John 1
Paul 1
II’s 1
Universi 1
Dominici 1
Gregis, 1
which 1
provides: 1

The 1
Cardinal 1
electors 1
shall 1
further 1
abstain 1
from 1
any 1
form 1
of 1
pact, 1
agreement, 1
promise 1
or 1
other 1
commitment 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
which 1
could 1
oblige 1
them 1
to 1
give 1
or 1
deny 1
their 1
vote 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
or 1
persons. 1

If 1
this 1
were 1
in 1
fact 1
done, 1
even 1
under 1
oath, 1
I 1
decree 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
commitment 1
shall 1
be 1
null 1
and 1
void 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
shall 1
be 1
bound 1
to 1
observe 1
it; 1
and 1
I 1
hereby 1
impose 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
excommunication 1
latae 1
sententiae 1
upon 1
those 1
who 1
violate 1
this 1
prohibition. 1

To 1
quote 1
Cajetan 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
(citations 1
taken 1
from 1
the 1
linked 1
article 1
by 1
Robert 1
Siscoe), 1
deposition 1
by 1
an 1
imperfect 1
council 1
is 1
appropriate 1
“when 1
one 1
or 1
more 1
Popes 1
suffer 1
uncertainty 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
their 1
election, 1
as 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
arisen 1
in 1
the 1
schism 1
of 1
Urban 1
VI 1
and 1
others. 1

Then, 1
lest 1
the 1
Church 1
be 1
perplexed, 1
those 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
who 1
are 1
available 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
judge 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
pope, 1
if 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
known, 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
known, 1
[it 1
has] 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
provide 1
that 1
the 1
electors 1
agree 1
on 1
one 1
or 1
another 1
of 1
them.” 1

I 0
am 0
not 0
saying 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
case 0
has 0
been 0
proven. 0

Rather, 0
what 0
I 0
am 0
saying 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
hypothetical 0
imperfect 0
council 0
could 0
determine 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
proven 0
and 0
act 0
accordingly, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
would 0
judge 0
any 0
resulting 0
deposition 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
manner 0
it 0
judges 0
the 0
deposition 0
of 0
Benedict 0
IX. 0

Another 0
ground 0
for 0
deposition—as 0
determined 0
by 0
the 0
imperfect 0
council, 0
not 0
any 0
of 0
us—would 0
be 0
that 0
Bergoglio 1
has 1
deposed 1
himself 1
by 1
promulgating 1
heresy, 1
fracturing 1
the 1
Church’s 1
universal 1
discipline 1
respecting 1
marriage 1
and 1
the 1
Eucharist, 1
and 1
undermining 1
the 1
teaching 1
of 1
even 1
his 1
own 1
immediate 1
predecessors 1
on 1
matters 1
of 1
fundamental 1
morality 1
upheld 1
by 1
the 1
Magisterium 1
for 1
two 1
millennia. 1

Surely 0
the 0
Church 0
cannot 0
be 0
without 0
any 0
remedy 0
for 0
a 1
Pope 1
who 1
relentlessly 1
attacks 1
her 1
very 1
foundations! 1

To 1
quote 1
Cajetan 1
again: 1
“Indeed 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
separate 1
herself 1
from 1
an 1
heretical 1
pope 1
according 1
to 1
divine 1
law. 1

Consequently, 1
it 1
has 1
the 1
right, 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
divine 1
law, 1
to 1
use 1
all 1
means 1
of 1
themselves 1
necessary 1
for 1
such 1
separation; 1
and 1
those 1
that 1
juridically 1
correspond 1
to 1
the 1
crime, 1
are 1
of 1
themselves 1
necessary”—meaning 1
the 1
resort 1
to 1
an 1
imperfect 1
council. 1

If 0
a 0
synod 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
declare 0
the 0
deposition 0
of 0
a 0
pope 0
in 0
1046, 0
why 0
not 0
an 0
imperfect 0
council 0
today—or, 0
for 0
that 0
matter, 0
another 0
synod? 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
argued 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
deposition 0
would 0
provoke 0
massive 0
schisms 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

But 0
that 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
that 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
common 0
good 0
has 0
done 0
so, 0
as 0
the 0
Great 0
Western 0
Schism 0
demonstrates. 0

And 1
are 1
we 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
schisms 1
already, 1
provoked 1
by 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
Bergoglio 1
himself, 1
whose 1
insane 1
drive 1
to 1
shatter 1
the 1
Church’s 1
bimillennial 1
discipline 1
has 1
produced 1
the 1
totally 1
unprecedented 1
situation 1
in 1
which 1
what 1
is 1
still 1
considered 1
mortally 1
sinful 1
in 1
one 1
diocese 1
is 1
an 1
imperative 1
of 1
“mercy” 1
in 1
another? 1

In 0
any 0
case, 0
this 0
much 0
is 0
certain: 0
barring 0
Bergoglio’s 0
conversion 0
and 0
reversal 0
of 0
course, 0
the 0
Church 0
cannot 0
abide 0
this 0
pontificate 0
any 0
longer. 0

One 0
way 0
or 0
another, 0
the 0
Church 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
repel 0
an 0
attacker 0
at 0
her 0
very 0
summit. 0

Either 1
the 1
human 1
element 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
will 1
act 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
means 1
which 1
seem 1
possible, 1
however 1
extraordinary, 1
or 1
Heaven 1
itself 1
will 1
intervene 1
in 0
a 0
manner 0
that 0
might 0
well 0
involve 0
a 0
divine 0
chastisement 0
due 0
to 0
the 1
negligence 1
of 1
time-serving 1
pastors 1
who 1
left 1
their 1
sheep 1
completely 1
undefended 1
against 1
the 1
wolves 1
who 1
preyed 1
upon 1
them, 1
including 0
the 1
wolf 1
the 1
cardinals 1
improvidently 1
elected 1
Pope. 1

Some 0
four 0
months 0
before 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
Cardinal 0
Willem 0
Jacobus 0
Eijk, 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Utrecht, 0
Netherlands, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
liberal 0
territory 0
in 0
the 0
entire 0
Church, 0
protested 0
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
blatant 0
nod 0
to 0
intercommunion 0
with 0
Protestants 0
in 0
Germany 0
means 0
that 0
“the 1
bishops 1
and, 1
above 1
all, 1
the 1
Successor 1
of 1
Peter 1
fail 1
to 1
maintain 1
and 1
transmit 1
faithfully 1
and 1
in 1
unity 1
the 1
deposit 1
of 1
faith 1
contained 1
in 1
Sacred 1
Tradition 1
and 1
Sacred 1
Scripture” 1
and 0
that 0
the 0
situation 0
reminds 0
him 0
of 0
Article 0
675 0
of 0
the 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
which 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Church’s 0
“final 0
trial” 0
before 0
the 0
Second 0
Coming, 0
“that 0
will 0
shake 0
the 0
faith 0
of 0
many 0
believers… 0
[a] 0
‘mystery 0
of 0
iniquity’ 0
in 0
the 0
form 0
of 0
a 0
religious 0
deception 0
offering 0
men 0
an 0
apparent 0
solution 0
to 0
their 0
problems 0
at 0
the 0
price 0
of 0
apostasy 0
from 0
the 0
truth. 0

What 0
can 0
the 0
Church 0
do 0
when 0
confronted 0
by 0
a 1
Pope 1
who, 1
as 1
a 1
prominent 1
cardinal 1
declares 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
world, 1
“fail[s] 1
to 1
maintain 1
and 1
transmit 1
faithfully 1
… 1
the 1
deposit 1
of 1
faith 1
contained 1
in 1
Sacred 1
Tradition 1
and 1
Sacred 1
Scripture” 1
and 1
is 1
leading 1
“an 1
apostasy 1
from 1
the 1
truth”? 1

It 1
seems 1
absurd 1
to 0
argue 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
do 0
nothing 0
but 0
exhort 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
pray 0
and 0
do 0
penance 0
while 0
a 1
papal 1
malefactor, 1
treated 1
as 1
if 1
were 1
an 1
absolute 1
dictator, 1
is 0
allowed 0
to 0
continue 0
wreaking 1
havoc 1
upon 1
faith 1
and 1
morals 1
to 1
the 1
detriment 1
of 1
countless 1
souls, 1
without 0
the 0
least 0
impediment, 0
for 0
so 0
long 0
as 0
he 0
shall 0
live. 0

No, 0
Bergoglio 0
must 0
go. 0

The 1
successors 1
of 1
the 1
Apostles, 1
the 1
only 1
ones 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
end 1
his 1
rampage, 1
must 1
demand 1
his 1
resignation 1
and, 1
should 1
he 1
refuse 1
as 1
expected, 1
act 1
in 1
this 1
unprecedented 1
emergency 1
to 1
declare 1
his 1
removal 1
from 1
the 1
office 1
he 1
has 1
criminally 1
abused 1
and 1
whose 1
very 1
credibility 1
he 1
threatens 1
to 1
destroy. 1

May 0
God 0
give 0
them 0
the 0
grace 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
must 0
be 0
done 0
and 0
what 0
history 0
will 0
vindicate 0
as 0
a 0
rescue 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
during 1
the 1
height 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
crisis 1
in 1
her 1
history. 1
