her 0 6 5

an 0 6 5

The 0 6 7

this 0 6 7

sparked 0 6 7
criticism 0 6 7
against 0 6 7
the 0 6 7
police 0 6 7
department, 0 6 7
which 0 6 7
waited 0 6 7
days 0 6 7
to 0 6 7
arrest 0 6 7
Guyger, 0 6 7
then 0 6 7
went 0 6 7
weeks 0 6 7
without 0 6 7
disciplining 0 6 7
her 0 6 7
even 0 6 7
though 0 6 7
she 0 6 7
was 0 6 7
placed 0 6 7
on 0 6 7
leave. 0 6 7

“The 0 6 8
delay 0 6 8
raised 0 6 8
questions 0 6 8
about 0 6 8
why 0 6 8
investigators 0 6 8
held 0 6 8
off 0 6 8
on 0 6 8
arresting 0 6 8
the 0 6 8
officer 0 6 8
and 0 6 8
about 0 6 8
whether 0 6 8
law 0 6 8

were 0 6 8
showing 0 6 8

Chief 0 6 9
U. 0 6 9

Hall 0 6 9
gave 0 6 9
contradictory 0 6 9
explanations 0 6 9
last 0 6 9
week 0 6 9
for 0 6 9
why 0 6 9
she 0 6 9
could 0 6 9
not 0 6 9
fire 0 6 9
the 0 6 9
officer. 0 6 9

She 0 6 10
told 0 6 10
a 0 6 10
town 0 6 10

that 0 6 10
“local, 0 6 10
state 0 6 10

days 0 6 11
later, 0 6 11
the 0 6 11
Dallas 0 6 11
Morning 0 6 11

reported 0 6 11
that 0 6 11

could 0 6 11

did 0 6 11
not 0 6 11
plan 0 6 11
to 0 6 11
review 0 6 11
her 0 6 11
employment 0 6 11
until 0 6 11
a 0 6 11

wrapped 0 6 11
up 0 6 11
— 0 6 11
probably 0 6 11
months 0 6 11

away. 0 6 12
In 0 6 12
a 0 6 12
statement, 0 6 12
Hall 0 6 12
said 0 6 12
that 0 6 12
any 0 6 12
disciplinary 0 6 12
investigation 0 6 12
would 0 6 12
risk 0 6 12
compromising 0 6 12
the 0 6 12
criminal 0 6 12

case. 0 6 13
“That 0 6 13

willing 0 6 13
to 0 6 13
take,” 0 6 13
she 0 6 13

said. 0 6 14
Police 0 6 14
did 0 6 14
not 0 6 14
explain 0 6 14
what 0 6 14
changed 0 6 14
by 0 6 14
Monday, 0 6 14
when 0 6 14
the 0 6 14
department 0 6 14
announced 0 6 14
that 0 6 14
an 0 6 14
internal-affairs 0 6 14
investigation 0 6 14
had 0 6 14
been 0 6 14
launched 0 6 14

already 0 6 14
“concluded” 0 6 14
that 0 6 14
Guyger’s 0 6 14
arrest 0 6 14
was 0 6 14
a 0 6 14
fireable 0 6 14
offense. 0 6 14

The 0 6 15
officer, 0 6 15

hired 0 6 15
in 0 6 15

Monday 0 6 15
morning 0 6 15
“for 0 6 15
her 0 6 15
actions.” 0 6 15

The 0 6 16
statement 0 6 16
notes 0 6 16
that 0 6 16
Guyger 0 6 16
can 0 6 16
appeal 0 6 16
her 0 6 16

firing. 0 6 17
Police 0 6 17
did 0 6 17
not 0 6 17
comment 0 6 17
on 0 6 17
whether 0 6 17
Hall 0 6 17
is 0 6 17
still 0 6 17
worried 0 6 17
that 0 6 17
the 0 6 17
