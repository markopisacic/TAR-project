weeks 0 377 7

She 0 377 10

Two 0 377 11

later, 0 377 11
the 0 377 11
Dallas 0 377 11

to 0 377 11
review 0 377 11
her 0 377 11
employment 0 377 11
until 0 377 11
a 0 377 11
criminal 0 377 11
investigation 0 377 11
wrapped 0 377 11
up 0 377 11
— 0 377 11
probably 0 377 11
months 0 377 11
away. 0 377 11

In 0 377 12
a 0 377 12
statement, 0 377 12
Hall 0 377 12
said 0 377 12
that 0 377 12
any 0 377 12
disciplinary 0 377 12

“That 0 377 13

explain 0 377 14
what 0 377 14
changed 0 377 14
by 0 377 14
Monday, 0 377 14
when 0 377 14
the 0 377 14
department 0 377 14
announced 0 377 14
that 0 377 14
an 0 377 14

“concluded” 0 377 14
that 0 377 14
Guyger’s 0 377 14
arrest 0 377 14
was 0 377 14
a 0 377 14
fireable 0 377 14
offense. 0 377 14

The 0 377 15
officer, 0 377 15
who 0 377 15
was 0 377 15
hired 0 377 15
in 0 377 15
late 0 377 15

Monday 0 377 15

significant 0 377 18
legal 0 377 18
questions 0 377 18

whether 0 377 18
Guyger 0 377 18
is 0 377 18
prosecuted 0 377 18
as 0 377 18
a 0 377 18
police 0 377 18
officer 0 377 18
or 0 377 18
civilian 0 377 18
and 0 377 18
whether 0 377 18
a 0 377 18
jury 0 377 18
decides 0 377 18
she 0 377 18
acted 0 377 18
