Legislation 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
Conference 0
of 0
Mayors 0
passed 0
several 0
resolutions 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
called 0
for 0
more 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
legislation 0
following 0
all 0
the 0
debate 0
about 0
guns 0
after 0
several 0
shootings, 0
despite 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
government 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
given 1
authority 1
to 1
restrict 1
or 1
regulate 1
arms. 1

Part 0
of 0
the 0
hypocrisy 1
of 0
the 0
US 0
Conference 0
of 0
Mayors 0
is 0
that 0
they 0
actually 0
push 0
to 0
infringe 0
on 0
law-abiding 0
citizens' 0
rights 0
while 0
claiming 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment. 0

For 0
example, 0

of 0
this 0
is 0
consistent 1
with 0

the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
is 0
anyone's 0
guess. 0

I 0
think 0
they 0
throw 0
that 0
language 0
in 0
to 0
cover 0
for 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
attacking 0
it 0
head 0
on 0
and 0
attacking 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
people. 1

How 0
does 0
any 0
of 0
this 0
stop 0
gun 0
violence? 0

It 0
doesn't. 0

What 0
it 0
does 0
do 0
is 0
infringe 0
on 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
teachers, 0
law-abiding 1
citizens 1
who 0
want 0
to 0
purchase 0
several 0
guns 0
which 0
they 0
will 0
use 0
lawfully, 0
sides 0
with 0
criminals 0
against 0
law-abiding 1
citizens 1
as 0
it 0
opposes 0
stand 0
your 0
ground 0
and 0
other 0
measures 0
written 0
specifically 0
to 0
protect 0
people 0
who 0
would 0
normally 0
be 0
victims 0
of 0
crime. 0

Banning 0
semi-automatic 0
weapons 0
doesn't 0
stop 0
crime 0
either, 0
as 0
we've 0
pointed 0
out 0
before, 0
and 0
the 0
statistics 0
are 0
available 0
for 0
anyone 0
to 0
see 0
that 0
gun 0
violence 0
didn't 0
go 0
down 0
one 0
bit 0
during 0
the 0
decade 0
of 0
the 0
Clinton/Feinstein 0
assault 0
weapons 0
ban. 0

These 0
geniuses 1
also 0
"Support 0
Enactment 0
of 0

Checks, 0
Ban 0
the 0

Prevent 0

in 0
Schools." 0

Again, 0
this 0
will 0
do 0
nothing 0
to 0
stop 0
criminals 0
with 0
guns. 0

Why? 0

Because 0
they 0
won't 0
follow 0
your 0
unconstitutional 1
and 1
unlawful 1
laws 1
in 0
the 0
first 0
place! 0

On 0
top 0
of 0
that, 0
the 0
criminal 0
mayors 0
want 0
to 0
institute 0
red 0
flag 0
laws. 0

"The 0
U.S. 0
Conference 0
of 0
Mayors 0
registers 0
its 0
strong 0
support 0
for 0
extreme 0
risk 0
protection 0
order 0
laws 0
and 0
urges 0
both 0
states 0
and 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
to 0
enact 0
such 0
laws," 0
the 0
group 0
wrote. 0

They 0
are 0
fully 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
violating 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
of 0
otherwise 0
law-abiding 1
citizens 1
based 0
on 0
merely 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
someone 0
claims 0
that 0
a 0
family 0
member 0
is 0
a 0
harm 0
to 0
themselves 0
or 0
others, 0
even 0
though 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
committed 0
a 0
crime. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
Trump, 0
"Take 1
the 1
guns 1
first 1
and 1
then 1
due 1
process" 1
mantra. 0

Guns.com 0
reported 0
on 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
statements 0
made 0
by 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
mayors. 0

Karen 0
Freeman-Wilson, 0
mayor 0
of 0
Gary, 0
Indiana 0
and 0
chairwoman 0
of 0
the 0
conference’s 0
criminal 0
and 0
social 0
justice 0
committee, 0
said 0
gun-related 0
tragedies 0
“rips 0
families 0
and 0
communities 0
apart.” 0
“Policies 0
like 0
background 0
checks 0
on 0
all 0
gun 0
sales 0
and 0
Red 0
Flag 0
Laws 0
save 0
lives. 0

It’s 0
as 0
simple 0
as 0
that,” 0
Freeman-Wilson 0
said. 0

“The 0
U.S. 0
Conference 0
of 0
Mayors 0
will 0
continue 0
doing 0
everything 0
in 0
our 0
power 0
to 0
keep 0
our 1
communities 0
safe 0
so 0
that 0
children 0
and 0
families 0
are 0
able 0
to 0
live 0
free 0
of 0
the 0
fear 0
of 0
being 0
gunned 0
down.” 0
St. 0
Louis 0
Mayor 0
Lyda 0
Krewson 0
said 0
the 0
new 0
resolutions 0
show 0
mayors 0
will 0
“lead 0
the 0
way 0
in 0
solving 0
our 1
gun 0
violence 0
crisis.” 0
“We 1
wouldn’t 1
be 1
doing 1
our 1
jobs 1
as 1
mayors 1
if 1
we 1
weren’t 1
focusing 1
on 1
gun 1
violence 1
— 0
an 0
issue 0
that 0
threatens 0
the 0
public 0
safety 0
of 0
every 0
community, 0
big 0
and 0
small,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“Our 0
bipartisan 0
network 0
of 0
mayors 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
work 0
together 0
and 0
compromise 0
on 0
policies 0
that 0
save 0
lives. 0

If 0
only 0
our 0
partners 0
in 0
Congress 0
did 0
the 0
same.” 0
Gun 0
control 0
groups, 0
including 0
Everytown 0
for 0
Gun 0
Safety 0
and 0
Mayors 0
Against 0
Illegal 0
Guns, 0
praised 0
the 0
conference 0
for 0
reaffirming 0
its 0
support 0
for 0
stricter 0
regulations. 0

“Mayors 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
frontlines 0
of 0
America’s 0
gun 1
violence 1
crisis, 1
so 0
it’s 0
no 0
surprise 0
they’re 0
also 0
leading 0
the 0
charge 0
to 0
pass 0
common-sense, 0
life-saving 0
laws,” 0
said 0
Everytown 0
president 0
John 0
Feinblatt. 0

“It’s 0
time 0
for 0
our 1
leaders 0
in 0
Washington 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
lead 0
of 0
America’s 1
mayors 0
and 0
put 0
public 0
safety 0
over 0
NRA 0
priorities.” 0

None 0
of 0
these 0
statements 0
can 0
be 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
facts. 0

The 0
facts 0
refute 0
their 0
arguments, 0
but 0
beyond 0
that, 0
the 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
recognizes 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
keep 1
and 1
bear 1
arms 1
is 1
a 1
right 1
given 1
to 1
us 1
by 1
our 1
Creator, 1
not 1
a 1
permission 1
we 1
gain 1
from 1
government. 1

So, 0
while 0
they 0
tell 0
you 0
they 0
support 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
and 0
that 0
their 0
unlawful 1
policies 1
are 0
consistent 1
with 0
it, 0
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
further 1
from 1
the 1
truth. 1

If 0
you 0
buy 0
into 0
this, 0
you 0
probably 0
think 0
places 0
like 0
Chicago, 0
Illinois 0
are 0
among 0
the 0
safest 0
places 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
when 0
the 0
opposite 0
is 0
true. 0
