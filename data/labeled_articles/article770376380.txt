Pope 0

Denounces 0
“Murderous 1
Indifference” 1
To 0
Persecution 0
Of 0
Christians, 0
Of 0
Which 0
He 0
Is 0
A 0
Chief 0
Architect 0

Associated 0
Press 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
Ecumenical 0
Patriarch 0
Bartholomew 0
and 0
other 0
Orthodox 0
Patriarchs 0
met 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
Saturday, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
had 0
some 0
strong 0
words 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 0
persecution 0
of 0
Christians 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

The 0
Pope 0
couldn’t 1
resist 1
an 1
anti-Semitic 1
shot 1
at 1
Israeli 1
“occupation,” 1
but 0
he 0
also 0
seemed 0
to 0
denounce 0
Islamic 0
jihad 0
activity, 0
saying: 0
“So 0
many 0
conflicts 0
have 0
been 0
stoked 0
too 0
by 0
forms 0
of 0
fundamentalism 0
and 0
fanaticism 0
that, 0
under 0
the 0
guise 0
of 0
religion, 0
have 1
profaned 1
God’s 1
name 1
– 0
which 0
is 0
peace 0
– 0
and 0
persecuted 0
age-old 0
neighbors.” 0
He 1
decried 1
the 0
“thirst 0
for 0
profit 0
that 0
surreptitiously 0
exploits 0
oil 0
and 0
gas 0
fields 0
without 0
regard 0
for 0
our 0
common 0
home, 0
with 0
no 0
scruples 0
about 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
energy 0
market 0
now 0
dictates 0
the 0
law 0
of 0
coexistence 0
among 0
peoples!” 0

The 0
Pope 0
lamented 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
has 0
been 0
“covered 0
by 0
dark 0
clouds 0
of 0
war, 0
violence 0
and 0
destruction, 0
instances 0
of 0
occupation 0
and 0
varieties 0
of 0
fundamentalism, 0
forced 0
migration 0
and 0
neglect.” 0
And 0
he 1
deplored 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
“all 0
this 0
has 0
taken 0
place 0
amid 0
the 0
complicit 0
silence 0
of 0
many. 0

The 0
Middle 0
East 0
has 0
become 0
a 0
land 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
leave 0
their 0
own 0
lands 0
behind.” 0
He 0
cried: 0
“Indifference 1
kills, 1
and 0
we 0
desire 0
to 0
lift 0
up 0
our 0
voices 0
in 0
opposition 0
to 0
this 0
murderous 1
indifference. 1

For 0
the 1
Middle 1
East 1
today 1
is 1
weeping, 1
suffering 1
and 1
silent 1
as 1
others 1
trample 1
upon 1
those 1
lands 1
in 0
search 0
of 0
power 0
or 0
riches.” 0

These 1
are 1
odd 1
statements 1
coming 1
from 1
Pope 1
Francis, 1
a 1
world-class 1
Islamopanderer; 1
notice 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
who 1
was 1
doing 1
the 1
persecuting, 1
and 1
implied 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
fault 1
of 1
powers 1
outside 1
the 1
Middle 1
East. 1

The 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
as 0
a 0
whole 0
has 0
committed 0
itself 0
to 0
Islamopandering, 0
such 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
largely 0
silent 0
about 0
the 0
Muslim 0
persecution 0
of 0
Christians 0
that 0
has 0
taken 0
place 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

Why? 0

The 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
is 1
following 1
Pope 1
Francis’ 1
lead, 1
and 1
Francis 1
has 1
said: 1
“Christian 1
terrorism 1
does 1
not 1
exist, 1
Jewish 1
terrorism 1
does 1
not 1
exist, 1
and 1
Muslim 1
terrorism 1
does 1
not 1
exist. 1

They 1
do 1
not 1
exist.” 1
And 1
he 1
has 1
also 1
said: 1
“Authentic 1
Islam 1
and 1
the 1
proper 1
reading 1
of 1
the 1
Koran 1
are 1
opposed 1
to 1
every 1
form 1
of 1
violence.” 1

Jean-Clément 0
Jeanbart, 0
the 0
Melkite 0
Greek 0
Catholic 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Aleppo, 0
gave 0
an 0
interview 0
to 0
a 0
French 0
reporter 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
highly 0
critical 0
of 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
and 0
even 0
of 0
his 0
fellow 0
bishops 0
for 0
ignoring 0
the 0
Muslim 0
persecution 0
of 0
Middle 0
Eastern 0
Christians. 0

“The 0
European 0
media,” 0
he 0
charged, 0
“have 0
not 0
ceased 0
to 0
suppress 0
the 0
daily 0
news 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
suffering 0
in 0
Syria 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
even 0
justified 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
our 0
country 0
by 0
using 0
information 0
without 0
taking 0
the 0
trouble 0
to 0
verify 0
it.” 0
And 0
as 0
for 0
his 0
brother 0
bishops 0
in 0
France, 0
“the 0
conference 0
of 0
French 0
bishops 0
should 0
have 0
trusted 0
us, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
better 0
informed. 0

Why 1
are 1
your 1
bishops 1
silent 1
on 1
a 1
threat 1
that 1
is 1
yours 1
today 1
as 1
well? 1

Because 0
the 0
bishops 0
are 0
like 0
you, 0
raised 0
in 0
political 0
correctness. 0

But 0
Jesus 0
was 0
never 0
politically 0
correct, 0
he 0
was 0
politically 0
just!” 0

Archbishop 0
Jeanbart 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
say 0
this. 0

“Why, 1
we 1
ask 1
the 1
western 1
world, 1
why 1
not 1
raise 1
one’s 1
voice 1
over 1
so 1
much 1
ferocity 1
and 1
injustice?” 1
asked 0
Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Bagnasco, 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Italian 0
Bishops 0
Conference 0
(CEI). 0

Syriac 0
Catholic 0
Patriarch 0
Ignatius 0
Ephrem 0
Joseph 0
III 0
Younan 0
himself 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
appealed 0
to 0
the 0
West“not 0
to 0
forget 0
the 0
Christians 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East.” 0
The 0
former 0
Melkite 0
Greek 0
Catholic 0
Patriarch 0
Gregory 0
III 0
has 0
also 0
said: 0
“I 0
do 0
not 0
understand 0
why 0
the 0
world 0
does 0
not 0
raise 0
its 0
voice 0
against 0
such 0
acts 1
of 1
brutality.” 1

But 0
Gregory 0
III 0
should 0
have 0
understood, 0
since 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
problem. 0

He 0
himself 0
said: 0
“No 1
one 1
defends 1
Islam 1
like 1
Arab 1
Christians.” 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
defend 1
Islam 1
that 1
Western 1
clerics 1
do 1
not 1
raise 1
their 1
voice 1
against 1
such 1
acts 1
of 1
brutality. 1

It 1
is 1
to 1
pursue 1
a 1
fruitless 1
and 1
chimerical 1
“dialogue” 1
that 1
bishops 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
and 1
Europe 1
keep 1
silent 1
about 1
Muslim 1
persecution 1
of 1
Christians, 1
and 1
enforce 1
that 1
silence 1
upon 1
others. 1

Robert 0
McManus, 0
Roman 0
Catholic 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Worcester, 0
Massachusetts, 0
said 0
it 0
on 0
February 0
8, 0
2013 0
as 0
he 0
was 0
suppressing 0
a 0
planned 0
talk 0
at 0
a 0
Catholic 0
conference 0
on 0
that 0
persecution: 0
“Talk 1
about 1
extreme, 1
militant 1
Islamists 1
and 1
the 1
atrocities 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
perpetrated 1
globally 1
might 1
undercut 1
the 1
positive 1
achievements 1
that 1
we 1
Catholics 1
have 1
attained 1
in 1
our 1
inter-religious 1
dialogue 1
with 1
devout 1
Muslims.” 1

Remember 0
that 0
Mohamed 0
Atta, 0
about 0
the 0
plane 0
he 0
had 0
hijacked 0
on 0
September 0
11, 0
2001, 0
told 0
passengers 0
over 0
the 0
intercom: 0
“Stay 0
quiet 0
and 0
you’ll 0
be 0
OK.” 0
The 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
adopted 0
that 0
statement 0
as 0
its 0
policy 0
regarding 0
Muslim 0
persecution 0
of 0
Christians. 0

“Leave 0
them; 0
they 0
are 0
blind 1
guides. 1

And 0
if 0
a 0
blind 0
man 0
leads 0
a 0
blind 0
man, 0
both 0
will 0
fall 0
into 0
a 0
pit.” 0
