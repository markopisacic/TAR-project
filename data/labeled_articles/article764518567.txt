his 0 3 1
500 0 3 1
plus-page 0 3 1
report, 0 3 1
which 0 3 1
purports 0 3 1
to 0 3 1
shine 0 3 1
a 0 3 1
light 0 3 1
on 0 3 1
the 0 3 1
mishandling 0 3 1
at 0 3 1
top 0 3 1
levels 0 3 1
of 0 3 1
the 0 3 1

The 0 3 3

from 0 3 3
the 0 3 3

Justice’s 0 3 3
Office 0 3 3
of 0 3 3
the 0 3 3
Inspector 0 3 3
General 0 3 3
(“OIG”) 0 3 3
criticized 0 3 3
certain 0 3 3
actions 0 3 3
and 0 3 3
decisions 0 3 3
of 0 3 3
former 0 3 3
FBI 0 3 3
Director 0 3 3
James 0 3 3
Comey, 0 3 3
together 0 3 3
with 0 3 3
those 0 3 3
of 0 3 3
other 0 3 3
senior 0 3 3
FBI 0 3 3
officials 0 3 3
who 0 3 3
were 0 3 3
involved 0 3 3
in 0 3 3
the 0 3 3

including 0 3 3
former 0 3 3
Deputy 0 3 3
FBI 0 3 3
Director 0 3 3
Andrew 0 3 3
McCabe. 0 3 3

Mr. 0 3 4
McCabe 0 3 4
is 0 3 4
already 0 3 4
the 0 3 4

of 0 3 4

referral 0 3 4
from 0 3 4

his 0 3 4
alleged 0 3 4
unauthorized 0 3 4

who 0 3 5
has 0 3 5
since 0 3 5
left 0 3 5
the 0 3 5
FBI, 0 3 5
were 0 3 5
targeted 0 3 5
in 0 3 5
this 0 3 5
report 0 3 5
for 0 3 5
their 0 3 5
blatantly 1 3 5
anti-Trump 1 3 5
text 0 3 5
messages. 0 3 5

Former 0 3 6
Attorney 0 3 6
General 0 3 6
Loretta 0 3 6
Lynch 0 3 6
was 0 3 6
also 0 3 6
criticized 0 3 6
for 0 3 6
exercising 0 3 6
bad 0 3 6
judgment 0 3 6
in 0 3 6
connection 0 3 6
with 0 3 6
her 0 3 6
infamous 1 3 6
tarmac 0 3 6
meeting 0 3 6
with 0 3 6
Bill 0 3 6
Clinton. 0 3 6

Mr. 0 3 7
Horowitz’s 0 3 7
report 0 3 7
focused 0 3 7
on 0 3 7
process 0 3 7
and 0 3 7
procedures. 0 3 7

The 0 3 8
inspector 0 3 8
general 0 3 8
made 0 3 8
clear 0 3 8
when 0 3 8
he 0 3 8
launched 0 3 8
his 0 3 8
investigation 0 3 8
in 0 3 8
January 0 3 8
2017 0 3 8
that 0 3 8
“his 0 3 8
review 0 3 8
will 0 3 8
not 0 3 8
substitute 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
OIG's 0 3 8
judgment 0 3 8
for 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
judgments 0 3 8
made 0 3 8
by 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
FBI 0 3 8
or 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
Department 0 3 8
regarding 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
substantive 0 3 8
merits 0 3 8
of 0 3 8
investigative 0 3 8
or 0 3 8
prosecutive 0 3 8
decisions." 0 3 8

Moreover, 0 3 9
this 0 3 9
report 0 3 9
did 0 3 9
not 0 3 9
address 0 3 9
whether 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
Department 0 3 9
of 0 3 9
Justice 0 3 9
or 0 3 9
FBI 0 3 9
abused 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
Foreign 0 3 9
Intelligence 0 3 9
Surveillance 0 3 9
Act 0 3 9
to 0 3 9
obtain 0 3 9
a 0 3 9
surveillance 0 3 9
order 0 3 9
against 0 3 9
former 0 3 9
Trump 0 3 9
campaign 0 3 9
advisor 0 3 9
Carter 0 3 9
Page, 0 3 9
or 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
government’s 0 3 9
reliance 0 3 9
on 0 3 9
former 0 3 9
British 0 3 9
intelligence 0 3 9
agent 0 3 9
Christopher 0 3 9
Steele’s 0 3 9
salacious 1 3 9
and 0 3 9
unverified 0 3 9
“dossier” 0 3 9
in 0 3 9
its 0 3 9
FISA 0 3 9
court 0 3 9
application, 0 3 9
which 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
OIG 0 3 9
is 0 3 9
investigating 0 3 9
separately. 0 3 9

In 0 3 10
analyzing 0 3 10
the 0 3 10
highly 0 3 10
anticipated 0 3 10
OIG 0 3 10
report’s 0 3 10
conclusions, 0 3 10
it 0 3 10
is 0 3 10
clear 0 3 10
that 0 3 10
either 0 3 10
Mr. 0 3 10
Horowitz 0 3 10
himself 0 3 10
decided 0 3 10
to 0 3 10
pull 0 3 10
his 0 3 10
punches 0 3 10
or 0 3 10
that 0 3 10
the 0 3 10
final 0 3 10
version, 0 3 10
which 0 3 10
had 0 3 10
been 0 3 10
reviewed 0 3 10
by 0 3 10
upper 0 3 10
echelons 0 3 10
in 0 3 10
both 0 3 10
the 0 3 10
FBI 0 3 10
and 0 3 10
Justice 0 3 10
Department 0 3 10
before 0 3 10
its 0 3 10
public 0 3 10
release, 0 3 10
emerged 1 3 10
in 1 3 10
a 1 3 10
disappointingly 1 3 10
watered-down 1 3 10
form. 1 3 10

To 0 3 11
be 0 3 11
sure, 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
report 0 3 11
faulted 0 3 11
Comey 0 3 11
for 0 3 11
deviating 0 3 11
from 0 3 11
FBI 0 3 11
and 0 3 11
Justice 0 3 11
Department 0 3 11
procedures 0 3 11
in 0 3 11
handling 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
probe 0 3 11
into 0 3 11
Hillary 0 3 11
Clinton’s 0 3 11
use 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
a 0 3 11
private 0 3 11
e-mail 0 3 11
server 0 3 11
while 0 3 11
she 0 3 11
served 0 3 11
as 0 3 11
Secretary 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
State, 0 3 11
thereby 0 3 11
negatively 0 3 11
impacting 0 3 11
“the 0 3 11
perception 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
FBI 0 3 11
and 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
department 0 3 11
as 0 3 11
fair 0 3 11
administrators 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
justice.” 0 3 11
Comey, 0 3 11
according 0 3 11
to 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
OIG 0 3 11
report, 0 3 11
“engaged 0 3 11
in 0 3 11
ad 0 3 11
hoc 0 3 11
decision 0 3 11
making 0 3 11
based 0 3 11
on 0 3 11
his 0 3 11
personal 0 3 11
views 0 3 11
even 0 3 11
if 0 3 11
it 0 3 11
meant 0 3 11
rejecting 0 3 11
longstanding 0 3 11
Department 0 3 11
policy 0 3 11
or 0 3 11
practice.” 0 3 11

Starting 0 3 12
with 0 3 12
Comey’s 0 3 12
public 0 3 12
announcement 0 3 12
on 0 3 12
July 0 3 12
5, 0 3 12
2016 0 3 12
criticizing 0 3 12
Hillary 0 3 12
Clinton 0 3 12
and 0 3 12
her 0 3 12
staff 0 3 12
for 0 3 12
being 0 3 12
“extremely 1 3 12
careless 1 3 12
in 0 3 12
their 0 3 12
handling 0 3 12
of 0 3 12
very 0 3 12
sensitive, 0 3 12
highly 0 3 12
classified 0 3 12
information,” 0 3 12
but 0 3 12
also 0 3 12
announcing 0 3 12
that 0 3 12
the 0 3 12
FBI 0 3 12
was 0 3 12
“expressing 0 3 12
to 0 3 12
Justice 0 3 12
our 0 3 12
view 0 3 12
that 0 3 12
no 0 3 12
charges 0 3 12
are 0 3 12
appropriate 0 3 12
in 0 3 12
this 0 3 12
case,” 0 3 12
Comey 0 3 12
was 0 3 12
taken 0 3 12
to 0 3 12
task 0 3 12
for 0 3 12
insubordination 0 3 12
and 0 3 12
usurping 0 3 12
the 0 3 12
authority 0 3 12
of 0 3 12
the 0 3 12
attorney 0 3 12
general. 0 3 12

He 0 3 13
“upset 0 3 13
the 0 3 13
well-established 0 3 13
separation 0 3 13
between 0 3 13
investigative 0 3 13
and 0 3 13
prosecutorial 0 3 13
functions,” 0 3 13
the 0 3 13
report 0 3 13
said. 0 3 13

Comey’s 0 3 14
follow-up 0 3 14
letters 0 3 14
to 0 3 14
Congress 0 3 14
on 0 3 14
October 0 3 14
28 0 3 14
and 0 3 14
November 0 3 14
6, 0 3 14
2016 0 3 14
were 0 3 14
similarly 0 3 14
criticized. 0 3 14

The 0 3 15
first 0 3 15
letter 0 3 15
informed 0 3 15
Congress 0 3 15
that 0 3 15
agents 0 3 15
were 0 3 15
reopening 0 3 15
their 0 3 15
probe 0 3 15
into 0 3 15
Clinton’s 0 3 15
handling 0 3 15
of 0 3 15
classified 0 3 15
material 0 3 15
after 0 3 15
discovering 0 3 15
her 0 3 15
e-mails 0 3 15
on 0 3 15
the 0 3 15
laptop 0 3 15
of 0 3 15
Andrew 0 3 15
Weiner, 0 3 15
the 0 3 15
husband 0 3 15
of 0 3 15
Clinton’s 0 3 15
top 0 3 15
aide 0 3 15
Huma 0 3 15
Abedin. 0 3 15

This 0 3 16
letter 0 3 16
was 0 3 16
followed 0 3 16
on 0 3 16
November 0 3 16
6, 0 3 16
2016 0 3 16
by 0 3 16
Comey’s 0 3 16
statement 0 3 16
that 0 3 16
the 0 3 16
review 0 3 16
of 0 3 16
the 0 3 16
additional 0 3 16
information 0 3 16
had 0 3 16
been 0 3 16
completed 0 3 16
and 0 3 16
that 0 3 16
the 0 3 16
FBI 0 3 16
remained 0 3 16
convinced 0 3 16
that 0 3 16
charges 0 3 16
were 0 3 16
not 0 3 16
appropriate. 0 3 16

Comey 0 3 17
acted 0 3 17
against 0 3 17
the 0 3 17
advice 0 3 17
of 0 3 17
senior 0 3 17
Justice 0 3 17
Department 0 3 17
officials 0 3 17
in 0 3 17
making 0 3 17
these 0 3 17
disclosures 0 3 17
the 0 3 17
way 0 3 17
he 0 3 17
did. 0 3 17

The 0 3 18
OIG 0 3 18
report 0 3 18
was 0 3 18
highly 0 3 18
critical 0 3 18
of 0 3 18
the 0 3 18
FBI’s 0 3 18
failure 0 3 18
to 0 3 18
take 0 3 18
immediate 0 3 18
action 0 3 18
on 0 3 18
the 0 3 18
Weiner 0 3 18
laptop 0 3 18
when 0 3 18
they 0 3 18
first 0 3 18
learned 0 3 18
about 0 3 18
it 0 3 18
in 0 3 18
late 0 3 18
September 0 3 18
2016, 0 3 18
rather 0 3 18
than 0 3 18
waiting 0 3 18
another 0 3 18
month 0 3 18
so 0 3 18
close 0 3 18
to 0 3 18
the 0 3 18
election. 0 3 18

The 0 3 19
criticisms 0 3 19
of 0 3 19
Comey's 0 3 19
undisciplined 0 3 19
behavior 0 3 19
was 0 3 19
all 0 3 19
well 0 3 19
and 0 3 19
good, 0 3 19
but 0 3 19
it 0 3 19
was 0 3 19
reasonable 0 3 19
to 0 3 19
expect 0 3 19
something 0 3 19
more 0 3 19
than 0 3 19
the 0 3 19
equivalent 0 3 19
of 0 3 19
a 0 3 19
departmental 0 3 19
employee 0 3 19
review 0 3 19
after 0 3 19
nearly 0 3 19
a 0 3 19
year 0 3 19
and 0 3 19
a 0 3 19
half 0 3 19
of 0 3 19
investigation. 0 3 19

Hillary 0 3 20
Clinton’s 0 3 20
supporters 0 3 20
will 0 3 20
no 0 3 20
doubt 0 3 20
jump 0 3 20
on 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
inspector 0 3 20
general’s 0 3 20
criticisms 0 3 20
of 0 3 20
Comey’s 0 3 20
handling 0 3 20
of 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
July 0 3 20
5th 0 3 20
announcement 0 3 20
and 0 3 20
subsequent 0 3 20
letters 0 3 20
as 0 3 20
proof 0 3 20
that 0 3 20
he 0 3 20
improperly 0 3 20
influenced 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
outcome 0 3 20
of 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
election 0 3 20
in 0 3 20
President 0 3 20
Trump’s 0 3 20
favor, 0 3 20
even 0 3 20
if 0 3 20
he 0 3 20
did 0 3 20
not 0 3 20
do 0 3 20
so 0 3 20
deliberately 0 3 20
for 0 3 20
political 0 3 20
reasons. 0 3 20

However, 0 3 21
what 0 3 21
Comey 0 3 21
really 0 3 21
did 0 3 21
was 0 3 21
to 0 3 21
give 1 3 21
Hillary 1 3 21
Clinton 1 3 21
a 1 3 21
Get 1 3 21
Out 1 3 21
of 1 3 21
Jail 1 3 21
Free 1 3 21
card. 1 3 21

The 0 3 22
fix 0 3 22
was 0 3 22
in 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
early 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
May 0 3 22
2016, 0 3 22
well 0 3 22
before 0 3 22
the 0 3 22
FBI 0 3 22
interviews 0 3 22
of 0 3 22
Hillary 0 3 22
Clinton 0 3 22
and 0 3 22
of 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
many 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
17 0 3 22
other 0 3 22
key 0 3 22
witnesses, 0 3 22
when 0 3 22
Comey 0 3 22
began 0 3 22
the 0 3 22
process 0 3 22
of 0 3 22
drafting 0 3 22
an 0 3 22
exoneration 0 3 22
memo. 0 3 22

Comey’s 0 3 23
initial 0 3 23
draft 0 3 23
statement, 0 3 23
which 0 3 23
he 0 3 23
shared 0 3 23
with 0 3 23
FBI 0 3 23
senior 0 3 23
leadership 0 3 23
on 0 3 23
May 0 3 23
2, 0 3 23
criticized 0 3 23
Clinton’s 0 3 23
handling 0 3 23
of 0 3 23
classified 0 3 23
information 0 3 23
as 0 3 23
“grossly 1 3 23
negligent,” 1 3 23
but 0 3 23
concluded 0 3 23
that 0 3 23
“no 0 3 23
reasonable 0 3 23
prosecutor” 0 3 23
would 0 3 23
bring 0 3 23
a 0 3 23
case 0 3 23
based 0 3 23
on 0 3 23
the 0 3 23
facts 0 3 23
developed 0 3 23
in 0 3 23
the 0 3 23
investigation. 0 3 23

Indeed, 0 3 24
Comey 0 3 24
admitted 0 3 24
in 0 3 24
his 0 3 24
book 0 3 24
that 0 3 24
“we 0 3 24
started 0 3 24
the 0 3 24
Clinton 0 3 24
investigation 0 3 24
aware 0 3 24
that 0 3 24
it 0 3 24
was 0 3 24
unlikely 0 3 24
to 0 3 24
be 0 3 24
a 0 3 24
case 0 3 24
that 0 3 24
career 0 3 24
prosecutors 0 3 24
at 0 3 24
the 0 3 24
Department 0 3 24
of 0 3 24
Justice 0 3 24
would 0 3 24
prosecute.” 0 3 24

If 0 3 25
putting 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
cart 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
exoneration 0 3 25
before 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
horse 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
investigation 0 3 25
were 0 3 25
not 0 3 25
enough, 0 3 25
Comey’s 0 3 25
draft 0 3 25
statement 0 3 25
underwent 0 3 25
various 0 3 25
language 0 3 25
changes 0 3 25
over 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
course 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
next 0 3 25
two 0 3 25
months, 0 3 25
including, 0 3 25
most 0 3 25
importantly, 0 3 25
changing 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
description 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
Clinton’s 0 3 25
handling 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
classified 0 3 25
information 0 3 25
from 0 3 25
“grossly 1 3 25
negligent” 1 3 25
to 0 3 25
“extremely 1 3 25
careless.” 1 3 25
This 0 3 25
change 0 3 25
was 0 3 25
critical 0 3 25
because 0 3 25
“gross 1 3 25
negligence” 1 3 25
is 0 3 25
specifically 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
legal 0 3 25
term 0 3 25
used 0 3 25
in 0 3 25
stating 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
statutory 0 3 25
requirement 0 3 25
in 0 3 25
18 0 3 25
U.S. 0 3 25
Code 0 3 25
§ 0 3 25
793(f) 0 3 25
for 0 3 25
a 0 3 25
finding 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
criminal 0 3 25
conduct. 0 3 25

Comey’s 0 3 26
substitution 0 3 26
of 0 3 26
a 0 3 26
legally 0 3 26
meaningless 0 3 26
phrase, 0 3 26
“extremely 1 3 26
careless,” 1 3 26
for 0 3 26
the 0 3 26
“gross 1 3 26
negligence” 1 3 26
statutory 0 3 26
legal 0 3 26
standard 0 3 26
he 0 3 26
had 0 3 26
originally 0 3 26
used, 0 3 26
had 0 3 26
the 0 3 26
effect 0 3 26
of 0 3 26
prejudging 0 3 26
the 0 3 26
facts 0 3 26
in 0 3 26
Hillary 0 3 26
Clinton’s 0 3 26
favor. 0 3 26

Andrew 0 3 27
McCabe, 0 3 27
Peter 0 3 27
Strzok 0 3 27
and 0 3 27
Lisa 0 3 27
Page 0 3 27
were 0 3 27
involved 0 3 27
in 0 3 27
the 0 3 27
edits. 0 3 27

Inspector 0 3 28
General 0 3 28
Horowitz 0 3 28
saw 0 3 28
no 0 3 28
problem 0 3 28
with 0 3 28
this 0 3 28
pattern 0 3 28
of 0 3 28
obfuscation 0 3 28
regarding 0 3 28
the 0 3 28
deletion 0 3 28
of 0 3 28
the 0 3 28
legally 0 3 28
significant 0 3 28
phrase 0 3 28
“gross 1 3 28
negligence” 1 3 28
from 0 3 28
Comey’s 0 3 28
statement. 0 3 28

Mr. 0 3 29
Horowitz 0 3 29
relied 0 3 29
in 0 3 29
part 0 3 29
on 0 3 29
opinions 0 3 29
from 0 3 29
prosecutors 0 3 29
that 0 3 29
there 0 3 29
was 0 3 29
not 0 3 29
enough 0 3 29
evidence 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
charge 0 3 29
Clinton 0 3 29
with 0 3 29
acting 0 3 29
in 0 3 29
a 0 3 29
manner 0 3 29
that 0 3 29
rose 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
a 0 3 29
level 0 3 29
of 0 3 29
criminal 0 3 29
gross 1 3 29
negligence 1 3 29
with 0 3 29
respect 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
sending 0 3 29
or 0 3 29
receiving 0 3 29
e-mails 0 3 29
determined 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
contain 0 3 29
classified 0 3 29
information. 0 3 29

Mr. 0 3 30
Horowitz’s 0 3 30
report 0 3 30
thus 0 3 30
concluded, 0 3 30
“We 0 3 30
did 0 3 30
not 0 3 30
identify 0 3 30
evidence 0 3 30
of 0 3 30
bias 0 3 30
or 0 3 30
improper 0 3 30
considerations.” 0 3 30
This 0 3 30
conclusion 0 3 30
defies 0 3 30
common 0 3 30
sense. 0 3 30

Gross 1 3 31
negligence 1 3 31
is 0 3 31
not 0 3 31
the 0 3 31
same 0 3 31
as 0 3 31
willful 0 3 31
intent, 0 3 31
which 0 3 31
Comey 0 3 31
and 0 3 31
his 0 3 31
team 0 3 31
sought 0 3 31
to 0 3 31
conflate 0 3 31
in 0 3 31
exonerating 0 3 31
Hillary 0 3 31
Clinton 0 3 31
before 0 3 31
the 0 3 31
investigation 0 3 31
was 0 3 31
concluded. 0 3 31

Clinton 0 3 32
was 0 3 32
fully 0 3 32
aware 0 3 32
of 0 3 32
what 0 3 32
she 0 3 32
was 0 3 32
doing 0 3 32
when 0 3 32
she 0 3 32
set 0 3 32
up 0 3 32
the 0 3 32
private 0 3 32
server 0 3 32
arrangement 0 3 32
in 0 3 32
the 0 3 32
first 0 3 32
place 0 3 32
and 0 3 32
knowingly 0 3 32
used 0 3 32
it 0 3 32
to 0 3 32
send 0 3 32
and 0 3 32
receive 0 3 32
e-mails 0 3 32
involving 0 3 32
official 0 3 32
government 0 3 32
business, 0 3 32
which 0 3 32
by 0 3 32
their 0 3 32
very 0 3 32
nature 0 3 32
would 0 3 32
be 0 3 32
expected 0 3 32
to 0 3 32
include 0 3 32
classified 0 3 32
information. 0 3 32

It 0 3 33
turns 0 3 33
out 0 3 33
that 0 3 33
some 0 3 33
of 0 3 33
the 0 3 33
e-mails 0 3 33
were 0 3 33
accessed 0 3 33
by 0 3 33
foreign 0 3 33
parties. 0 3 33

Hillary 0 3 34
lied 0 3 34
repeatedly 0 3 34
when 0 3 34
she 0 3 34
first 0 3 34
denied 0 3 34
there 0 3 34
were 0 3 34
any 0 3 34
classified 0 3 34
e-mails 0 3 34
on 0 3 34
her 0 3 34
system 0 3 34
and 0 3 34
then 0 3 34
described 0 3 34
some 0 3 34
of 0 3 34
the 0 3 34
e-mails 0 3 34
involved 0 3 34
in 0 3 34
the 0 3 34
investigation 0 3 34
as 0 3 34
having 0 3 34
been 0 3 34
classified 0 3 34
after 0 3 34
the 0 3 34
fact. 0 3 34

As 0 3 35
Comey 0 3 35
has 0 3 35
admitted, 0 3 35
several 0 3 35
e-mail 0 3 35
chains 0 3 35
concerned 0 3 35
matters 0 3 35
that 0 3 35
were 0 3 35
classified 0 3 35
at 0 3 35
the 0 3 35
Top 0 3 35
Secret/Special 0 3 35
Access 0 3 35
Program 0 3 35
level 0 3 35
when 0 3 35
they 0 3 35
were 0 3 35
sent 0 3 35
and 0 3 35
received 0 3 35
by 0 3 35
Clinton. 0 3 35

Coupled 0 3 36
with 0 3 36
her 0 3 36
agents’ 0 3 36
destruction 0 3 36
of 0 3 36
thousands 0 3 36
of 0 3 36
e-mails 0 3 36
that 0 3 36
had 0 3 36
been 0 3 36
subpoenaed 0 3 36
by 0 3 36
Congress, 0 3 36
Hillary’s 0 3 36
conduct 0 3 36
was 0 3 36
criminally 1 3 36
reckless 1 3 36
at 0 3 36
the 0 3 36
very 0 3 36
least, 0 3 36
if 0 3 36
not 0 3 36
constituting 0 3 36
willful 1 3 36
intent 1 3 36
to 1 3 36
commit 1 3 36
an 1 3 36
act 1 3 36
she 1 3 36
knew 1 3 36
was 1 3 36
wrongful. 1 3 36

Yet 0 3 37
Mr. 0 3 37
Horowitz 0 3 37
saw 0 3 37
no 0 3 37
reason 0 3 37
to 0 3 37
doubt 0 3 37
the 0 3 37
sincerity 0 3 37
of 0 3 37
Comey's 0 3 37
explanations 0 3 37
for 0 3 37
giving 0 3 37
Hillary 0 3 37
a 0 3 37
free 0 3 37
pass. 0 3 37

The 0 3 38
failure 0 3 38
to 0 3 38
at 0 3 38
least 0 3 38
empanel 0 3 38
a 0 3 38
grand 0 3 38
jury 0 3 38
to 0 3 38
compel 0 3 38
testimony 0 3 38
from 0 3 38
Hillary 0 3 38
Clinton 0 3 38
and 0 3 38
key 0 3 38
witnesses 0 3 38
was 0 3 38
itself 0 3 38
a 0 3 38
complete 0 3 38
dereliction 0 3 38
of 0 3 38
duty, 0 3 38
which 0 3 38
could 0 3 38
have 0 3 38
only 0 3 38
been 0 3 38
motivated 0 3 38
by 0 3 38
a 0 3 38
desire 0 3 38
to 0 3 38
treat 1 3 38
Hillary 1 3 38
Clinton 1 3 38
with 1 3 38
kid 1 3 38
gloves 1 3 38
for 0 3 38
improper 0 3 38
reasons. 0 3 38

Incredibly, 0 3 39
however, 0 3 39
Mr. 0 3 39
Horowitz’s 0 3 39
report 0 3 39
“found 0 3 39
no 0 3 39
persuasive 0 3 39
evidence… 0 3 39
that 0 3 39
the 0 3 39
outcome 0 3 39
of 0 3 39
the 0 3 39
investigation 0 3 39
would 0 3 39
have 0 3 39
been 0 3 39
different 0 3 39
had 0 3 39
Clinton 0 3 39
been 0 3 39
subpoenaed 0 3 39
before 0 3 39
the 0 3 39
grand 0 3 39
jury.” 0 3 39

Mr. 0 3 40
Horowitz 0 3 40
also 0 3 40
did 0 3 40
not 0 3 40
deem 0 3 40
Comey’s 0 3 40
possible 0 3 40
perjury 0 3 40
in 0 3 40
his 0 3 40
testimony 0 3 40
before 0 3 40
Congress 0 3 40
to 0 3 40
be 0 3 40
an 0 3 40
appropriate 0 3 40
subject 0 3 40
for 0 3 40
criminal 0 3 40
referral. 0 3 40

Comey 0 3 41
testified 0 3 41
that 0 3 41
his 0 3 41
decision 0 3 41
to 0 3 41
exonerate 0 3 41
Hillary 0 3 41
was 0 3 41
not 0 3 41
made 0 3 41
before 0 3 41
her 0 3 41
interview 0 3 41
took 0 3 41
place, 0 3 41
when 0 3 41
for 0 3 41
all 0 3 41
intents 0 3 41
and 0 3 41
purposes 0 3 41
it 0 3 41
was. 0 3 41

Mr. 0 3 42
Horowitz 0 3 42
simply 0 3 42
took 0 3 42
Comey’s 0 3 42
word 0 3 42
for 0 3 42
what 0 3 42
he 0 3 42
had 0 3 42
meant. 0 3 42

Inspector 0 3 43
General 0 3 43
Horowitz 0 3 43
again 0 3 43
emphasized 0 3 43
form 0 3 43
and 0 3 43
process 0 3 43
over 0 3 43
substance 0 3 43
in 0 3 43
finding 0 3 43
a 0 3 43
“troubling 0 3 43
lack 0 3 43
of 0 3 43
any 0 3 43
direct, 0 3 43
substantive 0 3 43
communication” 0 3 43
between 0 3 43
Comey 0 3 43
and 0 3 43
Attorney 0 3 43
General 0 3 43
Lynch 0 3 43
ahead 0 3 43
of 0 3 43
Comey’s 0 3 43
July 0 3 43
5 0 3 43
press 0 3 43
conference 0 3 43
on 0 3 43
Clinton 0 3 43
and 0 3 43
his 0 3 43
October 0 3 43
28 0 3 43
letter 0 3 43
to 0 3 43
Congress. 0 3 43

Attorney 0 3 44
General 0 3 44
Lynch’s 0 3 44
infamous 1 3 44
tarmac 0 3 44
meeting 0 3 44
with 0 3 44
Bill 0 3 44
Clinton 0 3 44
was 0 3 44
discussed 0 3 44
in 0 3 44
the 0 3 44
report, 0 3 44
but 0 3 44
mostly 0 3 44
in 0 3 44
the 0 3 44
context 0 3 44
of 0 3 44
how 0 3 44
it 0 3 44
affected 0 3 44
Comey’s 0 3 44
decision 0 3 44
to 0 3 44
go 0 3 44
rogue, 0 3 44
so 0 3 44
to 0 3 44
speak, 0 3 44
in 0 3 44
making 0 3 44
his 0 3 44
July 0 3 44
5th 0 3 44
announcement 0 3 44
without 0 3 44
prior 0 3 44
approval 0 3 44
from 0 3 44
the 0 3 44
Justice 0 3 44
Department. 0 3 44

As 0 3 45
to 0 3 45
the 0 3 45
substance 0 3 45
of 0 3 45
Ms. 0 3 45
Lynch’s 0 3 45
decision 0 3 45
to 0 3 45
meet 0 3 45
with 0 3 45
Bill 0 3 45
Clinton 0 3 45
at 0 3 45
all 0 3 45
before 0 3 45
his 0 3 45
wife’s 0 3 45
FBI 0 3 45
interview, 0 3 45
all 0 3 45
Mr. 0 3 45
Horowitz’s 0 3 45
report 0 3 45
had 0 3 45
to 0 3 45
say 0 3 45
was 0 3 45
that 0 3 45
it 0 3 45
was 0 3 45
“an 0 3 45
error 0 3 45
in 0 3 45
judgment.” 0 3 45

The 0 3 46
OIG 0 3 46
report 0 3 46
also 0 3 46
criticized 0 3 46
the 0 3 46
conduct 0 3 46
of 0 3 46
Peter 0 3 46
Strzok 0 3 46
and 0 3 46
Lisa 0 3 46
Page, 0 3 46
who 0 3 46
had 0 3 46
exchanged 0 3 46
text 0 3 46
messages 0 3 46
sharply 1 3 46
critical 1 3 46
of 1 3 46
Mr. 1 3 46
Trump 1 3 46
before 0 3 46
and 0 3 46
after 0 3 46
the 0 3 46
election, 0 3 46
for 0 3 46
casting 0 3 46
“a 0 3 46
cloud 0 3 46
over 0 3 46
the 0 3 46
entire 0 3 46
FBI 0 3 46
investigation.” 0 3 46
The 0 3 46
report 0 3 46
referenced 0 3 46
a 0 3 46
text 0 3 46
message 0 3 46
on 0 3 46
August 0 3 46
8, 0 3 46
2016, 0 3 46
in 0 3 46
which 0 3 46
Strzok 0 3 46
reassured 0 3 46
Page 0 3 46
that 0 3 46
she 0 3 46
need 0 3 46
not 0 3 46
worry 0 3 46
about 0 3 46
Donald 0 3 46
Trump 0 3 46
becoming 0 3 46
president. 0 3 46

Trump 0 3 47
is 0 3 47
“not 0 3 47
ever 0 3 47
going 0 3 47
to 0 3 47
become 0 3 47
president, 0 3 47
right? 0 3 47

Right? 0 3 48

!” 0 3 49
Page 0 3 49
texted 0 3 49
Strzok. 0 3 49

“No. 0 3 50

No 0 3 51
he’s 0 3 51
not. 0 3 51

We’ll 0 3 52
stop 0 3 52
it,” 0 3 52
Strzok 0 3 52
responded. 0 3 52

Mr. 0 3 53
Horowitz 0 3 53
wrote 0 3 53
that 0 3 53
this 0 3 53
exchange 0 3 53
was 0 3 53
“not 0 3 53
only 0 3 53
indicative 0 3 53
of 0 3 53
a 0 3 53
biased 0 3 53

even 0 3 53
more 0 3 53
seriously, 0 3 53
implies 0 3 53
a 0 3 53
willingness 0 3 53
to 0 3 53
take 0 3 53
official 0 3 53
action 0 3 53
to 0 3 53
impact 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
presidential 0 3 53
candidate’s 0 3 53
electoral 0 3 53
prospects.” 0 3 53
The 0 3 53
inspector 0 3 53
general 0 3 53
questioned 0 3 53
whether 0 3 53
Strzok’s 0 3 53
decision 0 3 53
to 0 3 53
prioritize 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
Russia 0 3 53
collusion 0 3 53
investigation 0 3 53
over 0 3 53
following 0 3 53
up 0 3 53
on 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
Clinton 0 3 53
e-mail-related 0 3 53
investigative 0 3 53
lead 0 3 53
discovered 0 3 53
on 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
Weiner 0 3 53
laptop 0 3 53
was 0 3 53
free 0 3 53
from 0 3 53
bias. 0 3 53

Ultimately, 0 3 54
however, 0 3 54
he 0 3 54
inexplicably 1 3 54
concluded 1 3 54
that 0 3 54
there 0 3 54
was 0 3 54
no 0 3 54
finding 0 3 54
of 0 3 54
“documentary 0 3 54
or 0 3 54
testimonial 0 3 54
evidence 0 3 54
that 0 3 54
improper 0 3 54
considerations, 0 3 54
including 0 3 54
political 0 3 54
bias, 0 3 54
directly 0 3 54
affected 0 3 54
the 0 3 54
specific 0 3 54
investigative 0 3 54
decisions” 0 3 54
discussed 0 3 54
in 0 3 54
the 0 3 54
OIG 0 3 54
report. 0 3 54

Strzok 0 3 55
should 0 3 55
have 0 3 55
been 0 3 55
subject 0 3 55
to 0 3 55
a 0 3 55
criminal 0 3 55
referral 0 3 55
for 0 3 55
arguably 0 3 55
violating 0 3 55

§ 0 3 56
595, 0 3 56
enacted 0 3 56
as 0 3 56
part 0 3 56
of 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
original 0 3 56
1939 0 3 56
Hatch 0 3 56
Act, 0 3 56
prohibiting 0 3 56
any 0 3 56
public 0 3 56
officer 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
employee, 0 3 56
in 0 3 56
connection 0 3 56
with 0 3 56
an 0 3 56
activity 0 3 56
financed 0 3 56
wholly 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
in 0 3 56
part 0 3 56
by 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
United 0 3 56
States, 0 3 56
from 0 3 56
using 0 3 56
his 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
her 0 3 56
official 0 3 56
authority 0 3 56
to 0 3 56
interfere 0 3 56
with 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
affect 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
nomination 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
election 0 3 56
of 0 3 56
a 0 3 56
candidate 0 3 56
for 0 3 56
federal 0 3 56
office 0 3 56
including 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
president 0 3 56
of 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
United 0 3 56
States. 0 3 56

The 0 3 57
punishment 0 3 57
for 0 3 57
violation 0 3 57
is 0 3 57
a 0 3 57
fine, 0 3 57
imprisonment 0 3 57
for 0 3 57
not 0 3 57
more 0 3 57
than 0 3 57
one 0 3 57
year 0 3 57
or 0 3 57
both. 0 3 57

Instead, 0 3 58
Strzok's 0 3 58
punishment 0 3 58
will 0 3 58
most 0 3 58
likely 0 3 58
be 0 3 58
limited 0 3 58
to 0 3 58
disciplinary 0 3 58
action 0 3 58
and 0 3 58
possibly 0 3 58
dismissal. 0 3 58

In 0 3 59
sum, 0 3 59
the 0 3 59
long-awaited 0 3 59
inspector 0 3 59
general 0 3 59
report 0 3 59
on 0 3 59
the 0 3 59
FBI’s 0 3 59

Justice 0 3 59

of 0 3 59
the 0 3 59
Hillary 0 3 59
Clinton 0 3 59
e-mail 0 3 59
investigation 0 3 59
is 0 3 59
as 1 3 59
disappointing 1 3 59

the 1 3 59
rigged 1 3 59
outcome 1 3 59
of 1 3 59
the 1 3 59
