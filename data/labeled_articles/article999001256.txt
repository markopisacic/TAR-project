Stacey 0
Abrams 0
ended 0
her 0
run 0
for 0
Georgia 0
governor 0
on 0
Friday, 0
but 0
the 0
Democrat 0
said 0
she 0
would 0
not 0
concede 0
the 0
contest 0
to 0
Republican 0
Brian 0
Kemp 0
and 0
planned 0
to 0
launch 0
a 0
voting 0
rights 0
group 0
to 0
file 0
“major” 0
litigation 0
challenging 0
election 0
policies. 0

As 0
state 0
officials 0
prepare 0
to 0
certify 0
the 0
vote, 0
Abrams 0
acknowledged 0
the 0
law 0
“allows 0
no 0
further 0
viable 0
remedy” 0
to 0
extend 0
her 0
quest 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
nation’s 0
first 0
black 0
female 0
governor. 0

But 0
she 0
laced 0
her 0
speech 0
with 0
biting 0
criticism 0
of 0
Kemp, 0
who 0
she 0
accused 0
of 0
leveraging 0
his 0
role 0
as 0
the 0
state’s 0
top 0
elections 0
official 0
to 0
suppress 0
voters. 0

“I 0
will 0
not 0
concede,” 0
she 0
added, 0
“because 0
the 0
erosion 0
of 0
our 0
democracy 0
is 0
not 0
right.” 0

You 1
mean 1
like 1
having 1
a 1
sister 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
wings 1
of 1
any 1
campaign 1
lawsuits, 1
Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

What 1
about 1
invalid 1
provisional 1
ballots 1
getting 1
mixed 1
in 1
with 1
valid 1
ones? 1

Maybe 1
a 1
little 1
electronic 1
voter 1
manipulation, 1
Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

How 1
about 1
non-citizens 1
and 1
illegal 1
aliens 1
voting, 1
Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

Are 0
these 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
erosion 0
of 0
the 0
democratic 0
process? 0

Sure 0
they 0
are 0
and 0
they 0
appear 0
to 0
all 0
be 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
party 0
that 0
Stacey 0
Abrams 0
represents, 0
but 0
she's 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
that. 0

But 0
she 0
wasn't 0
going 0
to 0
concede. 0

Nope, 0
that 0
arrogant 0
wanna-be 0
first 0
female 0
governor 0
of 0
Georgia 0
simply 0
would 0
not 0
bow 0
out 0
gracefully. 0

“To 0
watch 0
an 0
elected 0
official 0
who 0
claims 0
to 0
represent 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
this 0
state 0
baldly 1
pin 1
his 1
hopes 1
for 0
election 0
on 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
the 0
people’s 0
democratic 0
right 0
to 0
vote 0
has 0
been 0
truly 0
appalling,” 0
Abrams 0
said. 0

“So, 0
let’s 0
be 0
clear," 0
she 0
continued. 0

"This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
speech 0
of 0
concession. 0

Because 0
concession 0
means 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
an 0
action 0
is 0
right, 0
true 0
or 0
proper. 0

As 0
a 0
woman 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
faith, 0
I 0
cannot 0
concede 0
that. 0

But 0
my 0
assessment 0
is 0
the 0
law 0
currently 0
allows 0
no 0
further 0
viable 0
remedy.” 0

No, 0
concession 0
means 0
"a 0
thing 0
that 0
is 0
granted, 0
especially 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
demands; 0
a 0
thing 0
conceded." 0

Abrams 0
was 0
easily 0
defeated 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
votes. 0

She 0
was 0
the 0
one 0
trying 0
to 0
"find" 0
and 0
count 0
votes 0
remember? 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
claiming 0
there 0
was 0
cancellation 0
of 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
voter 0
registrations. 0

Where 0
is 0
her 0
evidence? 0

She 0
has 0
none. 0

Stacey 0
Abrams 0
is 0
a 0
sore 0
loser 0
just 0
like 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
this 0
little 0
temper 0
tantrum 0
she 0
put 0
on 0
display 0
will 0
probably 0
sink 1
any 1
chances 1
she 0
may 0
have 0
had 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
to 0
run 0
again. 0

Good! 1

Thank 1
God, 1
Georgia 1
didn't 1
elect 1
this 1
peach. 1
