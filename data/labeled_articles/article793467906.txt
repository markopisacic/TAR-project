You 0 112 3
can 0 112 3

Dina 0 112 4
Habib 0 112 4
Powell 0 112 4
was 0 112 4
an 0 112 4
influential 0 112 4
figure 0 112 4
in 0 112 4
the 0 112 4
Bush 0 112 4
administration. 0 112 4

The 0 112 5
Egyptian-American 0 112 5
immigrant 0 112 5
had 0 112 5
served 0 112 5
as 0 112 5
a 0 112 5
gatekeeper 0 112 5
for 0 112 5
George 0 112 5
W. 0 112 5
Bush. 0 112 5

If 0 112 6
you 0 112 6
wanted 0 112 6
a 0 112 6
job, 0 112 6
you 0 112 6
went 0 112 6
through 0 112 6
her. 0 112 6

Barely 0 112 7
30, 0 112 7
Habib 0 112 7
Powell 0 112 7
had 0 112 7
more 0 112 7
power 0 112 7
than 0 112 7
many 0 112 7
of 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
big 0 112 7
Bush 0 112 7
era 0 112 7
names 0 112 7
you 0 112 7
do 0 112 7
know. 0 112 7

Then 0 112 8
she 0 112 8
took 0 112 8
on 0 112 8
the 0 112 8
mission 0 112 8
of 0 112 8
promoting 0 112 8
America 0 112 8

the 0 112 8
Muslim 0 112 8
world 0 112 8
at 0 112 8
the 0 112 8
State 0 112 8
Department. 0 112 8

There 0 112 9
were 0 112 9
cultural 0 112 9
exchanges 0 112 9
with 0 112 9
Iran 0 112 9

Lebanon 0 112 9
and 0 112 9
the 0 112 9
Palestinian 0 112 9
Authority. 0 112 9

Afterward 0 112 10
it 0 112 10
was 0 112 10

Habib 0 112 11

had 0 112 11
all 0 112 11
the 0 112 11

Like 0 112 12
Valerie 0 112 12
Jarrett. 0 112 12

Arianna 0 112 13

and 0 112 14
which 0 112 14
employed 0 112 14
Huma 0 112 14
Abedin. 0 112 14

You 0 112 15
could 0 112 15
see 0 112 15
her 0 112 15
posing 0 112 15
next 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
Huma, 0 112 15
Arianna 0 112 15
and 0 112 15
a 0 112 15
Saudi 0 112 15

You 0 112 16
can 0 112 16
see 0 112 16
her 0 112 16

The 0 112 17
ATFP 0 112 17

originally 0 112 17
Rashid 0 112 17
Khalidi’s 0 112 17
American 0 112 17
Committee 0 112 17
on 0 112 17
Jerusalem. 0 112 17

Khalidi 0 112 18
was 0 112 18
the 0 112 18
former 0 112 18
PLO 0 112 18
spokesman 0 112 18
at 0 112 18
the 0 112 18

of 0 112 18
the 0 112 18
Obama 0 112 18

scandal. 0 112 18

And 0 112 19
Habib 0 112 19
Powell 0 112 19
was 0 112 19
there 0 112 19
as 0 112 19
a 0 112 19
presenter 0 112 19
at 0 112 19
the 0 112 19
Middle 0 112 19
East 0 112 19

the 0 112 19
PLO’s 0 112 19
Hanan 0 112 19
Ashrawi. 0 112 19

Unlike 0 112 20
McFarland, 0 112 20
Habib 0 112 20
Powell 0 112 20
had 0 112 20
no 0 112 20
national 0 112 20
security 0 112 20
background. 0 112 20

But 0 112 21
though 0 112 21
her 0 112 21
parents 0 112 21
were 0 112 21
Christians, 0 112 21
she 0 112 21
had 0 112 21
the 0 112 21
“right” 0 112 21
views 0 112 21
on 0 112 21
Islam. 0 112 21

In 0 112 22
Egypt, 0 112 22
she 0 112 22
had 0 112 22
described 0 112 22
how 0 112 22
Bush 0 112 22
after 0 112 22
September 0 112 22
11 0 112 22
had, 0 112 22
“visited 0 112 22
a 0 112 22
mosque, 0 112 22
took 0 112 22
off 0 112 22
his 0 112 22
shoes 0 112 22
and 0 112 22
paid 0 112 22
his 0 112 22
respects.” 0 112 22
"I 0 112 22
see 0 112 22
the 0 112 22

Islam 0 112 22
as 0 112 22
a 0 112 22
religion 0 112 22
of 0 112 22
peace, 0 112 22
I 0 112 22
see 0 112 22
him 0 112 22

Habib 0 112 22
Powell 0 112 22
had 0 112 22
attended 0 112 22
such 0 112 22
an 0 112 22
iftar 0 112 22
dinner. 0 112 22

Habib 0 112 23
Powell 0 112 23
has 0 112 23
been 0 112 23
described 0 112 23
as 0 112 23
the 0 112 23
Republican 0 112 23
Huma 0 112 23
Abedin. 0 112 23

And 0 112 24
she 0 112 24
was 0 112 24
quoted 0 112 24
as 0 112 24
saying 0 112 24
that 0 112 24
Abedin 0 112 24
“feels 0 112 24
a 0 112 24
deep 0 112 24
responsibility 0 112 24

more 0 112 24

between 0 112 24
her 0 112 24

and 0 112 24
culture 0 112 24
and 0 112 24
American 1 112 24
culture.” 1 112 24

And 0 112 25
Powell 0 112 25
has 0 112 25
been 0 112 25
on 0 112 25
cheerful 0 112 25
terms 0 112 25
with 0 112 25
at 0 112 25

And 0 112 26
with 0 112 26
Clintonworld 0 112 26
people. 0 112 26

In 0 112 27
2015, 0 112 27
Dina 0 112 27
Powell 0 112 27
– 0 112 27
President 0 112 27
Donald 0 112 27
Trump’s 0 112 27

Adviser 0 112 27
in 0 112 27
2017 0 112 27

sat 0 112 27
down 0 112 27

Samantha 0 112 27
Power 0 112 27
for 0 112 27
an 0 112 27
interview. 0 112 27

In 0 112 28
that 0 112 28
interview, 0 112 28
Powell 0 112 28
heaped 0 112 28
effusive 0 112 28
praise 0 112 28
upon 0 112 28
Power 0 112 28
and 0 112 28
can 0 112 28
be 0 112 28
seen 0 112 28
nodding 0 112 28
in 0 112 28
agreement 0 112 28
throughout. 0 112 28

Power 0 112 29
was 0 112 29
a 0 112 29
senior 0 112 29
adviser 0 112 29
to 0 112 29
President 0 112 29
Barack 0 112 29
Obama. 0 112 29

At 0 112 30
the 0 112 30
time, 0 112 30
Powell 0 112 30
– 0 112 30
an 0 112 30
executive 0 112 30
with 0 112 30
Goldman 0 112 30
Sachs 0 112 30
– 0 112 30
was 0 112 30
pushing 0 112 30
a 0 112 30
pet 0 112 30

known 0 112 30
as 0 112 30
10,000 0 112 30
women, 0 112 30
which 0 112 30
is 0 112 30
ostensibly 0 112 30
intended 0 112 30
to 0 112 30
foster 0 112 30
female 0 112 30
entrepreneurship. 0 112 30

When 0 112 31
Powell 0 112 31
was 0 112 31
at 0 112 31
Goldman 0 112 31
Sachs, 0 112 31
her 0 112 31
right-hand 0 112 31

was 0 112 31
Noa 0 112 31
Meyer. 0 112 31

Perhaps 0 112 32
not 0 112 32
so 0 112 32
coincidentally, 0 112 32
Meyer 0 112 32
worked 0 112 32
in 0 112 32
the 0 112 32

Powell 0 112 33
herself, 0 112 33
is 0 112 33
very 0 112 33
comfortable 0 112 33
with 0 112 33
Hillary 0 112 33
Clinton. 0 112 33

In 0 112 34
2013, 0 112 34
she 0 112 34
shared 0 112 34
a 0 112 34
stage 0 112 34

Hillary 0 112 34
at 0 112 34
the 0 112 34

In 0 112 35
2007, 0 112 35
Powell 0 112 35
was 0 112 35
named 0 112 35
to 0 112 35

On 0 112 36
June 0 112 36
14, 0 112 36
2016 0 112 36
Powell 0 112 36
participated 0 112 36
in 0 112 36
a 0 112 36
Summit 0 112 36
known 0 112 36

the 0 112 36
United 0 112 36

which 0 112 36
meshed 1 112 36
nicely 1 112 36
with 0 112 36
her 0 112 36
pet 0 112 36
project. 0 112 36

USW 0 112 37
was 0 112 37
also 0 112 37
rife 0 112 37
with 0 112 37
angry 1 112 37
left-wing 1 112 37
Democrats 1 112 37
seeking 0 112 37
to 0 112 37
get 0 112 37
Hillary 0 112 37
Clinton 0 112 37
elected 0 112 37
in 0 112 37
2016. 0 112 37

In 0 112 38
fact, 0 112 38
Barack 0 112 38
Obama’s 0 112 38
closest 0 112 38
adviser 0 112 38
Valerie 0 112 38
Jarrett 0 112 38
introduced 0 112 38
Powell, 0 112 38
who 0 112 38
returned 0 112 38
the 0 112 38
introduction 0 112 38
with 0 112 38
effusive 0 112 38
praise 0 112 38
for 0 112 38
Jarrett. 0 112 38

The 0 112 39
ex-Goldman 0 112 39
Sachs 0 112 39
executive 0 112 39
has 0 112 39
befriended 0 112 39
Obama’s 0 112 39
closest 0 112 39
adviser, 0 112 39
Valerie 0 112 39
Jarrett. 0 112 39

She 0 112 40
is 0 112 40
also 0 112 40
very 0 112 40
cozy 0 112 40
with 0 112 40
Hillary 0 112 40
Clinton’s 0 112 40

Now 0 112 41
there's 0 112 41
once 0 112 41
again 0 112 41
talk 0 112 41
of 0 112 41
moving 0 112 41
Dina 0 112 41

This 0 112 42
time 0 112 42
into 0 112 42
Nikki 0 112 42

The 0 112 43
talk 0 112 43
comes 0 112 43
from 0 112 43
the 0 112 43
GOP 0 112 43
establishment. 0 112 43

Powell 0 112 44
should 0 112 44
not 0 112 44
be 0 112 44
at 0 112 44
the 0 112 44
NSC, 0 112 44
where 0 112 44
she 0 112 44
replaced 0 112 44
K.T. 0 112 44

McFarland, 0 112 45
who 0 112 45
was 0 112 45
qualified 0 112 45
for 0 112 45
