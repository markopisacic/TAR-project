Alright? 0

This 0
is 0
a 1
f***ed 1
up 1

It’s 0
a 1

pass 0
and 0
using 0
a 0

raising 0

pay, 0
and 0

for 0
All, 0
admitting 0
they 0
are 0
lies. 0

So, 0
let’s 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Gillum’s 0
platform, 0
right? 0

Raise 0
the 0
corporate 0
tax 0
in 0
Florida 0
from 0
7 0
to 0
11 0
percent. 0

That 0
will 0
never 0
happen. 0

Raise 0
teachers’ 0
pay 0
to 0
$50,000; 0
that 0
will 0
never 0
happen. 0

Give 0
me 0
another 0
position. 0

Medicare 0
for 0
all; 0
that 0
will 0
never 0
happen. 0

The 0
reason 0

the 0
legislature 0
that 0
write 0
the 0

is 0
all 0
Republican-controlled. 0

Democratic 0

I 1
