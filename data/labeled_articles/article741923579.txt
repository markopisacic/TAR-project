FBI 0
Can’t 0
Find 0
Motive 0
of 0
Muslim 0
Who 0
Drove 0
Burning 0
Minivan 0
Onto 0
Travis 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base 0

“Motive 0
a 0
mystery 0
in 0
car 0
explosion 0
at 0
Travis 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base” 0
was 0
the 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
Times 0
headline, 0
and 0
this 0
one 0
is 0
indeed 0
a 0
real 0
mystery. 0

A 0
Muslim 0
named 0
Hafiz 0
Kazi, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Times, 0
“drove 0
a 0
burning 0
minivan 0
filled 0
with 0
propane 0
and 0
gas 0
tanks 0
into 0
the 0
front 0
gate 0
of 0
Travis 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base 0
in 0
Northern 0
California.” 0
After 0
scrutinizing 0
all 0
the 0
evidence 0
closely, 0
the 0
FBI 0
just 0
can’t 0
figure 0
out 0
what 0
could 0
possibly 0
have 0
been 0
Kazi’s 0
motive. 0

And 0
that 0
in 0
a 0
nutshell 0
shows 0
what’s 0
wrong 0
with 0
today’s 0
FBI. 0

Sean 0
Ragan, 0
FBI 0
special 0
agent 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
Sacramento 0
field 0
office, 0
stated: 0
“We 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
nexus 0
of 0
terrorism 0
at 0
this 0
point. 0

Now 0
the 0
question 0
is, 0
why. 0

Why 0
was 0
he 0
there? 0

What 0
led 0
him 0
there? 0

And 0
we 0
don’t 0
know 0
answers 0
to 0
that, 0
quite 0
frankly.” 0

The 0
Times 0
noted 0
that 0
when 0
emergency 0
responders 0
approached 0
the 0
burning 0
van 0
after 0
it 0
crashed, 0
“they 0
found 0
five 0
propane 0
tanks, 0
three 0
plastic 0
one-gallon 0
gas 0
cans, 0
several 0
lighters, 0
three 0
phones 0
and 0
a 0
gym 0
bag 0
with 0
personal 0
items, 0
Ragan 0
said.” 0

Yes, 0
what 0
Kazi 0
could 0
possibly 0
have 0
been 0
up 0
to 0
is 0
a 0
complete 0
mystery. 0

The 0
Times 0
added 0
that 0
“the 0
dead 0
man’s 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
and 0
affiliation 0
are 0
not 0
known 0
at 0
this 0
point, 0
said 0
Ragan, 0
who 0
debunked 0
a 0
rumor 0
that 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
‘jihad’ 0
video 0
was 0
found 0
on 0
Kazi’s 0
phone.” 0

All 0
right. 0

No 0
jihad 0
video. 0

And 0
no 0
“nexus 0
of 0
terrorism,” 0
according 0
to 0
Sean 0
Ragan. 0

What 0
is 0
a 0
nexus 0
of 0
terrorism? 0

Ragan 1
most 1
likely 1
means 1
that 1
investigators 1
didn’t 1
find 1
an 1
ISIS 1
membership 1
card 1
in 1
Kazi’s 1
wallet, 1
or 1
lots 1
of 1
phone 1
calls 1
to 1
Iraq 1
or 1
Syria, 1
or 1
a 1
note 1
from 1
Kazi 1
reading, 1
“I 1
did 1
this 1
for 1
Allah 1
and 1
Islam. 1

Allahu 1
akbar.” 1

Of 0
course, 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
had 0
found 0
those 0
things, 0
given 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
recent 0
track 0
record 0
of 0
denial 0
and 0
deception, 0
they 0
may 0
still 0
be 0
searching 0
for 0
Kazi’s 0
motive. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
a 0
larger 0
point 0
is 0
being 0
lost 0
here. 0

And 0
that 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
war 0
going 0
on. 0

We 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
Islamic 1
State, 1
al-Qaeda 1
and 1
other 1
groups 1
have 1
called 1
upon 1
Muslims 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
kill 1
military 1
personnel 1
and 1
police, 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
civilians. 1

We 0
know 0
that 0
Kazi, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
propane 0
and 0
gas 0
tanks 0
in 0
his 0
car, 0
was 0
clearly 0
trying 0
to 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
major 0
fire 0
that 0
would 0
kill 0
more 0
people 0
than 0
just 0
himself. 0

Even 0
if 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
to 0
Baghdadi, 0
the 0
likelihood 0
is 0
that 0
when 0
a 0
Muslim 0
drives 0
into 0
a 0
U.S. 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base 0
with 0
a 0
car 0
full 0
of 0
incendiaries, 0
probably 0
this 0
has 0
something 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
global 0
jihad. 0

The 1
FBI’s 1
bafflement 1
here 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
deep, 1
deep 1
corruption. 1

The 1
FBI 1
doesn’t 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
global 1
jihad, 1
or 1
that 1
Islam 1
has 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
terrorism. 1

It 1
doesn’t 1
admit 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
war 1
going 1
on, 1
and 1
treats 1
each 1
act 1
of 1
Islamic 1
terror 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
separate 1
and 1
discrete 1
criminal 1
event, 1
unrelated 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
others. 1

So 1
each 1
time 1
something 1
like 1
this 1
happens, 1
they’re 1
back 1
at 1
Square 1
One, 1
trying 1
to 1
figure 1
out 1
motive. 1

It’s 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Army 0
stopped 0
to 0
interrogate 0
every 0
German 0
soldier 0
who 0
crashed 0
through 0
the 0
Ardennes 0
Forest 0
at 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Battle 0
of 0
the 0
Bulge 0
in 0
1944, 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
each 0
one’s 0
actions 0
had 0
anything 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
German 1
Army 1
and 1
Adolf 1
Hitler’s 1
war 0
aims. 0

Authorities 0
are 0
also 0
investigating 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Kazi 0
was 0
suffering 0
from 0
any 0
mental 0
health 0
issues. 0

Here 0
again, 0
this 0
is 0
just 0
more 0
of 0
the 0
general 0
refusal 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
the 1
800-pound 1
gorilla 1
sitting 0
in 0
the 0
living 0
room 0
and 0
screaming 1
“Allahu 1
akbar.” 1
Sean 0
Ragan 0
might 0
explain 0
to 0
us 0
that 0
authorities 0
are 0
also 0
trying 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
German 1
invasion 1
of 1
Poland 1
in 1
September 1
1939 1
was 1
motivated 1
by 1
Nazism, 1
or 0
by 0
mental 0
health 0
issues 0
among 0
the 0
German 0
High 0
Command. 0

This 0
willful 0
ignorance 0
leads 0
to 0
a 0
diversion 0
and 0
waste 0
of 0
resources 0
that 0
is 0
astronomical 1
and 1
catastrophic. 1

How 0
long 0
is 0
this 0
comic 0
opera 0
going 0
to 0
continue? 0

If 0
the 0
jihadis 0
advance 0
even 0
into 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
Sacramento 0
offices, 0
will 0
agents 0
there 0
be 0
struggling 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
jihadis’ 0
motive 0
even 0
as 0
the 1
machete 1
begins 1
to 1
slice 1
through 1
their 1
necks? 1
