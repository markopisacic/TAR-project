(Now 0 143 0
what?) 0 143 0

Given 0 143 1
that 0 143 1
Pope 0 143 1
Francis 0 143 1
has, 0 143 1
since 0 143 1
that 0 143 1
interview 0 143 1
took 0 143 1
place, 0 143 1
attempted 0 143 1
to 0 143 1
make 0 143 1
the 0 143 1
Argentine 0 143 1
bishops’ 0 143 1
interpretation 0 143 1
of 0 143 1
AL 0 143 1
'magisterial'--an 0 143 1
interpretation 0 143 1
that 0 143 1
allows 0 143 1
public 0 143 1

Holy 0 143 1

my 0 143 1
question 0 143 1
on 0 143 1
January 0 143 1
9th 0 143 1
of 0 143 1
this 0 143 1
year 0 143 1
would 0 143 1
seem 0 143 1
to 0 143 1
take 0 143 1
on 0 143 1
new 0 143 1
relevancy. 0 143 1

In 0 143 2
my 0 143 2
interview 0 143 2
of 0 143 2
Raymond 0 143 2
Cardinal 0 143 2
Burke 0 143 2
less 0 143 2
than 0 143 2
one 0 143 2
year 0 143 2
ago, 0 143 2
I 0 143 2
asked 0 143 2
His 0 143 2
Eminence 0 143 2
to 0 143 2
clarify 0 143 2
what, 0 143 2
exactly, 0 143 2
is 0 143 2
the 0 143 2
level 0 143 2
of 0 143 2
authoritative 0 143 2
weight 0 143 2
of 0 143 2
Pope 0 143 2
Francis’s 0 143 2
post-synodal 0 143 2
exhortation, 0 143 2
Amoris 0 143 2
Laetitia. 0 143 2

Now, 0 143 3
Cardinal 0 143 3
Francesco 0 143 3
Coccopalmerio, 0 143 3
president 0 143 3
of 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
Pontifical 0 143 3
Council 0 143 3
for 0 143 3
Legislative 0 143 3
Texts, 0 143 3
made 0 143 3
it 0 143 3
very 0 143 3
clear 0 143 3
to 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
Catholic 0 143 3
News 0 143 3
Service 0 143 3
on 0 143 3
December 0 143 3
5 0 143 3
what 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
Pope 0 143 3
is 0 143 3
up 0 143 3
to: 0 143 3
“The 0 143 3
fact 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
pope 0 143 3
requested 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
his 0 143 3
letter 0 143 3
and 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
interpretations 0 143 3
of 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
Buenos 0 143 3
Aires 0 143 3
bishops 0 143 3
be 0 143 3
published 0 143 3
in 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
AAS 0 143 3
means 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
His 0 143 3
Holiness 0 143 3
has 0 143 3
given 0 143 3
these 0 143 3
documents 0 143 3
a 0 143 3
particular 0 143 3
qualification 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
elevates 0 143 3
them 0 143 3
to 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
level 0 143 3
of 0 143 3
being 0 143 3
official 0 143 3
teachings 0 143 3
of 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
church. 0 143 3

While 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
content 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
pope’s 0 143 4
letter 0 143 4
itself 0 143 4
does 0 143 4
not 0 143 4
contain 0 143 4
teachings 0 143 4
on 0 143 4
faith 0 143 4
and 0 143 4
morals, 0 143 4
it 0 143 4
does 0 143 4
point 0 143 4
toward 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
interpretations 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
Argentine 0 143 4
bishops 0 143 4
and 0 143 4
confirms 0 143 4
them 0 143 4
as 0 143 4
authentically 0 143 4
reflecting 0 143 4
his 0 143 4
own 0 143 4
mind. 0 143 4

Thus 0 143 5
together 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
two 0 143 5
documents 0 143 5
became 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
Holy 0 143 5
Father’s 0 143 5
authentic 0 143 5
magisterium 0 143 5
for 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
whole 0 143 5
church.” 0 143 5

What 0 143 6
Cardinal 0 143 6
Burke 0 143 6
rightly 0 143 6
describes 0 143 6
as 0 143 6
lacking 1 143 6
in 1 143 6
any 1 143 6
magisterial 1 143 6
weight 1 143 6
whatsoever—and, 1 143 6
in 0 143 6
fact, 0 143 6
in 0 143 6
dire 0 143 6
need 0 143 6
of 0 143 6
clarification 0 143 6
and 0 143 6
correction— 0 143 6
has 0 143 6
by 0 143 6
papal 0 143 6
fiat 0 143 6
been 0 143 6
declared 0 143 6
magisterial, 0 143 6
and 0 143 6
thus 0 143 6
binding 0 143 6
on 0 143 6
us 0 143 6
all. 0 143 6

Francis 1 143 7
made 1 143 7
it 1 143 7
clear 1 143 7
that 1 143 7
the 1 143 7
Argentine 1 143 7
bishops’ 1 143 7
interpretation 1 143 7
of 1 143 7
AL 1 143 7
allowing 1 143 7
public 1 143 7
adulterers 1 143 7
to 1 143 7
receive 1 143 7
Holy 1 143 7
Communion 1 143 7
“explains 1 143 7
precisely 1 143 7
the 1 143 7
meaning 1 143 7
of 1 143 7
Chapter 1 143 7
VIII 1 143 7
of 1 143 7
‘Amoris 1 143 7
Laetitia.’ 1 143 7
There 1 143 7
are 1 143 7
no 1 143 7
other 1 143 7
interpretations.” 1 143 7

I 0 143 8
would 0 143 8
imagine 0 143 8
this 0 143 8
outrageous 1 143 8
overreach 1 143 8
of 1 143 8
papal 1 143 8
authority 1 143 8
on 0 143 8
the 0 143 8
Pope's 0 143 8
part 0 143 8
would 0 143 8
make 0 143 8
it 0 143 8
ominously 1 143 8
clear 1 143 8
to 0 143 8
Cardinal 0 143 8
Burke 0 143 8
that 0 143 8
the 0 143 8
time 0 143 8
has 0 143 8
come 0 143 8
to 0 143 8
issue 0 143 8
his 0 143 8
public 0 143 8
correction 0 143 8
of 0 143 8
Pope 0 143 8
Francis's 0 143 8
erroneous 0 143 8
teaching. 0 143 8

The 0 143 9
moment, 0 143 9
it 0 143 9
would 0 143 9
seem, 0 143 9
has 0 143 9
come. 0 143 9

Cardinal 0 143 10
Burke, 0 143 10
please 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
in 0 143 10
God's 1 143 10
Holy 1 143 10
Name, 1 143 10
we 1 143 10
beg 1 143 10
you 1 143 10
to 1 143 10
act 1 143 10
now 1 143 10
-- 1 143 10
before 1 143 10
Pope 1 143 10
Francis 1 143 10
succeeds 1 143 10
in 1 143 10
tearing 1 143 10
the 1 143 10
Church 1 143 10
in 1 143 10
half 1 143 10
completely. 1 143 10

We 0 143 11
fear 0 143 11
that 0 143 11
your 0 143 11
silence 0 143 11
now, 0 143 11
in 0 143 11
the 0 143 11
face 0 143 11
of 0 143 11
this 1 143 11
latest 1 143 11
papal 1 143 11
travesty, 1 143 11
may 0 143 11
suggest 0 143 11
consent 0 143 11
to 0 143 11
the 0 143 11
claim 0 143 11
that 0 143 11
Amoris 0 143 11
Laetitia 0 143 11
is 0 143 11
magisterial, 0 143 11
and 0 143 11
thus 0 143 11
prove 0 143 11
more 0 143 11
damaging 0 143 11
than 0 143 11
if 0 143 11
you 0 143 11
had 0 143 11
never 0 143 11
raised 0 143 11
your 0 143 11
voice 0 143 11
at 0 143 11
all. 0 143 11

We 0 143 12
thank 0 143 12
God 0 143 12
for 0 143 12
the 0 143 12
courage 0 143 12
you've 0 143 12
shown 0 143 12
in 0 143 12
defending 0 143 12
His 0 143 12
Church 0 143 12
thus 0 143 12
far, 0 143 12
and 0 143 12
we 0 143 12
pray 0 143 12
he 0 143 12
will 0 143 12
continue 0 143 12
to 0 143 12
bless 0 143 12
and 0 143 12
protect 0 143 12
you 0 143 12
as 0 143 12
you 0 143 12
do 0 143 12
what 0 143 12
must 0 143 12
now 0 143 12
be 0 143 12
done. 0 143 12
