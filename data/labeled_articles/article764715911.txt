The 0
American 0
Medical 0
Association 0
(AMA) 0
should 0
seriously 0
consider 0
changing 0
their 0
names 0
since 0
they 1

about 1

out 0

not 0
only 0
calling 0
for 0
guns 0
and 0

the 0

Sara 0
Berg, 0
a 0
senior 0
writer 0
at 0
AMA, 0
was 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
lengthy 0
post 0
which 0
calls 0
for 0
all 0
sorts 0
of 0
government 0
overreach 0
and 0
unconstitutional 0
legislation. 0

And 0
though 0
she 0
has 0
a 0
huge 0
laundry 0
list 0
of 0
things 0
the 0
AMA 0
supports, 0
she 0
fails, 0
like 0
every 0
other 0
Socialist 0
and 0
Communist, 0
to 0
tell 0
us 0
exactly 0
how 0
these 0
measures 0
keep 0
people 0
safe 0
and 0
weapons 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
criminals. 0

Berg 0
and 0
the 0
AMA 0
want 0
to 0
pull 0
a 0
Dick's 0
Sporting 0
Goods 0
and 0
demand 0
that 0
people 0
be 0
21 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
purchase 0
a 0
firearm. 0

Does 0
Berg 0
and 0
the 0
AMA 0
support 0
our 1
military? 0

Do 0
they 0
not 0
know 0
that 0
18-year-olds 0
carry 0
firearms, 0
both 0
handguns 0
and 0
rifles? 0

I 0
ask, 0
as 0
I 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
issue 0
concerning 0
alcohol, 0
what 0
is 0
magic 0
about 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
21? 0

I 0
ask, 0
where 0
does 0
government 0
get 0
to 0
determine 0
who 0
gets 0
to 0
do 0
whatever 0
at 0
whatever 0
age 0
based 0
on 0
an 0
ambiguous 0
age 0
number? 0

Yet, 0
if 1
we 1
do 1
that, 1
we 1
won't 1
have 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
mass 1
shooters, 1
right? 0

Wrong. 0

Yeah, 0
that's 0
gonna 0
keep 0
people 0
safe. 0

It's 0
going 0
to 0
infringe 0
on 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
don't 0
commit 0
crimes 0
and 0
need 0
a 0
gun 0
to 0
protect 0
themselves 0
or 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
constitutional 0
militia. 0

The 0
AMA 0
also 0
wants 0
to 0
bypass 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
protections 0
concerning 0
someone 0
actually 0
being 0
indicted 0
and 0
found 0
guilty 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
being 0
deprived 0
of 0
their 0
liberty 0
and 0
property 0
as 0
they 0
promote 0
a 0
new 0
legal 0
procedure 0
by 0
which 0
“family 0
members, 0
intimate 0
partners, 0
household 0
members 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
personnel” 0
can 0
petition 0
courts 0
to 0
confiscate 0
firearms 0
from 0
people 0
“when 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
high 0
or 0
imminent 0
risk 0
for 0
violence.” 0

They 0
want 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
suggested 0
and 0
"take 0
the 0
guns 0
first" 0
and 0
forget 0
due 0
process. 0

See? 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
honest 0
about 0
who 0
they 0
are 0
and 0
name 0
themselves 0
the 0
Non-American 1
Medical 0
Association. 0

I'm 0
all 0
for 0
situations 0
like 0
Nikolas 0
Cruz 0
who 0
assaulted 0
teachers 0
and 0
students 0
being 0
arrested 0
and 0
tried 0
and 0
dealt 0
with 0
lawfully, 0
but 0
to 0
go 0
seizing 0
people's 0
property 0
and 0
denying 0
them 0
their 0
liberty 0
base 0
on 0
the 0
hearsay 0
of 0
another 0
person 0
is 0
anti-constitutional 0
and 0
anti-American. 1

Who 0
knows 0
exactly 0
what 0
they 0
mean 0
by 0
high-capacity 0
magazines. 0

I 0
mean, 0
for 0
the 0
most 0
part, 0
you 0
can 0
obtain 0
20 0
or 0
30 0
round 0
magazines 0
for 0
both 0
handguns 0
and 0
rifles. 0

In 0
some 0
cases, 0
you 0
can 0
purchase 0
drums 0
which 0
hold 0
50-100 0
rounds, 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
New 0
York, 0
the 0
NY 0
SAFE 0
Act 0
defines 0
your 0
high 0
capacity 0
magazine 0
to 0
hold 0
anything 0
more 0
than 0
7 0
rounds. 0

As 0
for 0
the 0
nonsensical 1
call 0
to 0
ban 0
armor-piercing 0
bullets, 0
virtually 0
every 0
caliber 0
of 0
bullet, 0
except 0
maybe 0
a 0
.22 0
can 0
pierce 0
kevlar-based 0
vests, 0
and 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
using 0
.22 0
magnums, 0
they 0
will 0
even 0
pierce 0
those! 0

At 0
the 0
2018 0

Annual 0

that 0
allow 0
for 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0

from 0

individuals. 0

The 0
delegates 0
also 0
modified 0
existing 0
policy 0
to: 0
Recognize 0
the 0
role 0
of 0
firearms 0
in 0
suicides. 0

Encourage 0
the 0
development 0
of 0
curricula 0
and 0
training 0
for 0
physicians 0
with 0
a 0
focus 0
on 0
suicide 0
risk 0
assessment 0
and 0
prevention 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
lethal 0
means 0
safety 0
counseling. 0

Encourage 1
physicians, 0
as 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
suicide 0
prevention 0
strategy, 0
to 0
discuss 0
lethal 0
means 0
safety 0
and 0
work 0
with 0
families 0
to 0
reduce 0
access 0
to 0
lethal 0
means 0
of 0
suicide. 0

Newly 0
adopted 0
policy 0
also 0
means 0
the 0
AMA 0
will: 0

Advocate 0
for 0
schools 0
to 0
remain 0
gun-free 0
zones 0
except 0
for 0
school-sanctioned 0
activities 0
and 0
professional 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officials. 0

Oppose 0
requirements 0
or 0
incentives 0
of 0
teachers 0
to 0
carry 0
weapons. 0

They 0
also 0
oppose 0
concealed 0
carry 0
reciprocity, 0
which 0
I 0
do 0
as 0
well, 0
but 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
principle 0
that 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment's 0
protections 0
extend 0
to 0
the 0
various 0
states 0
as 0
well, 0
since 0
it 0
recognizes 0
a 1
right, 1
not 1
a 1
permission, 1
to 1
keep 1
and 1
bear 1
arms. 1

I 0
also 0
oppose 0
it 0
because 0
it's 0
just 0
another 0
step 0
for 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
to 0
say 0
they 0
need 0
a 0
database 0
so 0
states 0
can 0
check, 0
thus 0
identifying 0
gun 0
owners 0
and 0
possibly 0
their 0
weapons. 0

“People 0
are 0
dying 0
of 0
gun 0
violence 0
in 0
our 1
homes, 0
churches, 0
schools, 0
on 0
street 0
corners 0
and 0
at 0
public 0
gatherings, 0
and 0
it’s 0
important 0
that 0
lawmakers, 0
policy 0
leaders 0
and 0
advocates 0
on 0
all 0
sides 0
seek 0
common 0
ground 0
to 0
address 0
this 0
public 1
health 1
crisis,” 1
said 0
AMA 0
Immediate 0
Past 0
President 0
David 0
O. 0
Barbe, 0
MD, 0
MHA. 0

“In 0
emergency 0
rooms 0
across 0
the 0
country, 0
the 0
carnage 1
of 1
gun 1
violence 1
has 0
become 0
a 0
too 0
routine 0
experience. 0

“Every 0
day,” 0
Dr. 0
Barbe 0
added, 0
“physicians 0
are 0
treating 0
suicide 0
victims, 0
victims 0
of 0

men 0

women 0
simply 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0

at 0
the 0
wrong 0
time. 0

It 0
doesn’t 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
this 0
way, 0
and 0
we 0
urge 0
lawmakers 0
to 0
act.” 0

Yeah, 0
and 0
people 1
are 1
dying 1
by 1
the 1
hundreds 1
of 1
thousands 1
at 1
the 1

of 1

I 1
don't 1

you 1

calling 1

shut 1
down 1
the 1
unconstitutional 1
FDA 1

put 1

statement 1

I'll 0
tell 0
you 0
why 0
they 0

out 0

that... 0
they 1
