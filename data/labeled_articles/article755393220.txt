For 0

may 0

be 0
paying 0
attention, 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
overthrow 0
Iran 0
has 0
long 0

in 0
the 0

In 0
fact, 0
in 0
April 0
2012, 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize-winning 0
journalist, 0
Seymour 0
Hersh 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Joint 0
Special 0

had 0
trained 0
(Mojahedin-e 0
Khalq) 0

operatives 0
at 0
a 0
secret 0
site 0
in 0
Nevada 0
from 0
2005 0

2009 0
for 0
this 0

purpose. 0

MEK 0
is 0
the 0
Iranian 0
political-militant 0
organization 0
that 0
advocates 0
for 0
the 0
violent 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime. 0

They 0
are 0
hardly 0
quiet 0
about 0
it. 0

Coincidentally, 0
MEK 0
was 0
classified 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
its 0

from 0

in 0

Ambassador 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

For 0
over 0
a 0
decade, 0
Bolton 0
has 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
Iran. 0

Now, 0
he’s 0
the 0
National 0
Security 0
Advisor. 0

It 0
just 0
so 0
happens 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
calls 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
Iran 0
was 0
caught 0
on 0
video 0
last 0
year 0
as 0
Bolton 0
gave 0
a 0
speech 0
at 0
the 0
Grand 0
Gathering 0
of 0
Iranians 0
for 0
Free 1
Iran. 1

“There 0
is 0
a 0
viable 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
the 0
ayatollahs, 0
and 0
that 0
opposition 0
is 0
centered 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
today. 0

I 0
had 0
said 0
for 0
over 0
10 0
years 0
since 0
coming 0
to 0
these 0
events, 0
that 0
the 0
declared 0
policy 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
should 0
be 0
the 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
mullahs’ 0
regime 0
in 0
Tehran. 0

The 0
behavior 0
and 0
the 0
objectives 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
change, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 0
only 0
solution 0
is 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
regime 0
itself. 0

And 0
that’s 0
why, 0
before 0
2019, 0
we 0
here 0
will 0
celebrate 0
in 0
Tehran!” 0

Pay 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
first 0
line 0
in 0
that 0
quote 0
above 0
in 0
which 0
Bolton 0
notes 0
that 0
the 0
opposition 0
needed 0
to 0
overthrow 0
Iran’s 0
current 0
regime 0
“is 0
centered 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
today.” 0
Who 1
was 1
in 1
that 1
room? 1

Well, 0
the 0
entire 0
event 0
was 0
actually 0
put 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
People’s 0
Mojahedin 0
Organization 0
of 0
Iran, 0
also 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
Mojahedin-e 0
Khalq 0
or 0
MEK. 0

As 0
Politico 0
pointed 0
out 0
in 0
a 0
2016 0
article, 0
despite 0
the 0
neocon 0
attempts 0
to 0
rewrite 0
history, 0
MEK 0
have 0
killed 0
Americans 0
and 0
committed 0
multiple 0
acts 0
of 0
terrorism. 0

For 0
decades, 0
and 0
based 0
on 0
U.S. 0
intelligence, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
government 0
has 0
blamed 0
the 0
MEK 0
for 0
killing 0
three 0
U.S. 0
Army 0
colonels 0
and 0
three 0
U.S. 0
contractors, 0
bombing 0
the 0
facilities 0
of 0
numerous 0
U.S. 0
companies 0
and 0
killing 0
innocent 0
Iranians. 0

To 0
recap, 0
the 0
formerly 0
terrorist-classified 0
organization 0
MEK, 0
trained 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
granted 0
special 0
privilege 0
status 0
by 0
then-Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
in 0
2012—which 0
has 0
since 0
been 0
heavily 0
funded 0
to 0
refine 0
their 0
image 0
by 0
having 0
famous 0
US 0
neoconservative 0
war 0
hawks 0
from 0
both 0
sides 0
of 0
the 0
isle 0
actually 0
chant 0
for 0
“regime 0
change” 0
on 0
their 0
behalf—is 0
now 0
the 0
darling 1
child 1
of 0
the 0
neocon 0
agenda 0
and 0
the 0
impetus 0
behind 0
what 0
could 0
kick 0
of 0
World 0
War 0
3. 0

While 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
is 0
certainly 0
no 0
bastion 0
of 0
freedom, 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
US 0
intervention 0
or 0
a 0
violent 0
revolution 0
would 0
be 0
beneficial 0
for 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
or 0
American 0
citizens 0
is 0
outright 1
insane. 1

To 0
see 0
what 0
US 0
intervention—through 0
military 0
support 0
and 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
opposition 0
groups—does 0
to 0
countries, 0
one 0
need 0
only 0
look 0
at 0
Syria, 0
Iraq, 0
Afghanistan, 0
and 0
Libya 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
horrific 1
death 0
tolls 0
and 0
war-ravaged 1
dystopias 1
left 0
in 0
America’s 0
wake. 0

To 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
over 0
the 0
years, 0
Trump’s 0
desire 0
to 0
intervene 0
in 0
Iran, 0
and 0
his 0
subsequent 0
support 0
in 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
from 0
all 0
sides 0
of 0
the 0
political 0
spectrum 0
should 0
come 0
as 0
no 0
surprise 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
plan 0
since 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
was 0
in 0
office 0
and 0
was 0
documented 0
in 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
PNAC 0
report. 0

This 0
was 0
even 0
admitted 0
by 0
General 0
Wesley 0
Clark, 0
former 0
Supreme 0
Allied 0
Commander 0
of 0
NATO, 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
planned 0
on 0
going 0
to 0
war 0
with 0
Iran, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
2001 0
memo 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
memo 0
that 0
describes 0
how 0
we’re 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
out 0
seven 0
countries 0
in 0
five 0
years,” 0
Clark 0
said. 0

“Starting 0
with 0
Iraq, 0
and 0
then 0
Syria, 0
Lebanon, 0
Libya, 0
Somalia, 0
Sudan, 0
and 0
finishing 0
off 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

All 0
presidents 0
since 0
Clinton 0
have 0
crossed 0
countries 0
off 0
this 0
list. 0

Now 0
it’s 0
Trump’s 0
turn. 0
