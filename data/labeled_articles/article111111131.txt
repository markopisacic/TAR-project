Trump's 0 10 0
North 0 10 0
Korean 0 10 0
gamble 0 10 0
ends 0 10 0
with 0 10 0
'special 0 10 0
bond' 0 10 0
with 0 10 0
Kim 0 10 0

Nearly 0 10 1
five 0 10 1
hours 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
unprecedented 1 10 1
and 0 10 1
surreal 1 10 1
talks 0 10 1
between 0 10 1
US 0 10 1
President 0 10 1
Donald 0 10 1
Trump 0 10 1
and 0 10 1
North 0 10 1
Korea's 0 10 1
Kim 0 10 1
Jong 0 10 1
Un 0 10 1
culminated 1 10 1
on 0 10 1
Tuesday 0 10 1
with 0 10 1
fulsome 1 10 1
declarations 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
a 0 10 1
new 0 10 1
friendship 0 10 1
but 0 10 1
just 0 10 1
vague 0 10 1
pledges 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
nuclear 0 10 1
disarmament. 0 10 1

For 0 10 2
Trump, 0 10 2
that 0 10 2
amounted 0 10 2
to 0 10 2
a 0 10 2
triumphant 1 10 2
outcome 0 10 2
in 0 10 2
his 0 10 2
extraordinary 1 10 2
gamble 0 10 2
with 0 10 2
the 0 10 2
rogue 1 10 2
kingdom's 1 10 2
despotic 1 10 2
leader. 1 10 2

But 0 10 3
there 0 10 3
were 0 10 3
scant 0 10 3
details 0 10 3
on 0 10 3
what 0 10 3
new 0 10 3
commitments 0 10 3
had 0 10 3
been 0 10 3
secured 0 10 3
from 0 10 3
Kim, 0 10 3
even 0 10 3
as 0 10 3
Trump 0 10 3
announced 0 10 3
he 0 10 3
would 0 10 3
end 0 10 3
the 0 10 3
regular 0 10 3
military 0 10 3
exercises 0 10 3
the 0 10 3
US 0 10 3
conducts 0 10 3
with 0 10 3
South 0 10 3
Korea. 0 10 3

Whether 0 10 4
nuclear 0 10 4
disarmament 0 10 4
is 0 10 4
indeed 0 10 4
the 0 10 4
final 0 10 4
outcome 0 10 4
of 0 10 4
Tuesday's 0 10 4
summit 0 10 4
won't 0 10 4
be 0 10 4
known 0 10 4
for 0 10 4
years, 0 10 4
if 0 10 4
not 0 10 4
decades. 0 10 4

But 0 10 5
the 0 10 5
dramatic 1 10 5
act 0 10 5
of 0 10 5
extending 0 10 5
his 0 10 5
hand 0 10 5
to 0 10 5
one 0 10 5
of 0 10 5
America's 0 10 5
longtime 0 10 5
adversaries 0 10 5
will 0 10 5
forever 1 10 5
illustrate 0 10 5
Trump's 1 10 5
gut-driven, 1 10 5
norm-shattering 1 10 5
tenure. 1 10 5

"We 0 10 6
both 0 10 6
want 0 10 6
to 0 10 6
do 0 10 6
something. 0 10 6

We 0 10 7
both 0 10 7
are 0 10 7
going 0 10 7
to 0 10 7
do 0 10 7
something. 0 10 7

And 0 10 8
we 0 10 8
have 0 10 8
developed 0 10 8
a 0 10 8
very 0 10 8
special 0 10 8
bond," 0 10 8
Trump 0 10 8
said 0 10 8
at 0 10 8
the 0 10 8
conclusion 0 10 8
of 0 10 8
the 0 10 8
landmark 0 10 8
summit. 0 10 8

"People 1 10 9
are 1 10 9
going 1 10 9
to 1 10 9
be 1 10 9
very 1 10 9
impressed. 1 10 9

People 0 10 10
are 0 10 10
going 0 10 10
to 0 10 10
be 0 10 10
very 0 10 10
happy." 0 10 10

The 0 10 11
document 0 10 11
he 0 10 11
and 0 10 11
Kim 0 10 11
signed 0 10 11
said 0 10 11
the 0 10 11
North 0 10 11
Korean 0 10 11
leader 0 10 11
"reaffirmed 0 10 11
his 0 10 11
firm 0 10 11
and 0 10 11
unwavering 1 10 11
commitment 0 10 11
to 0 10 11
complete 0 10 11
denuclearization 0 10 11
of 0 10 11
the 0 10 11
Korean 0 10 11
Peninsula." 0 10 11

In 0 10 12
exchange, 0 10 12
Trump 0 10 12
agreed 0 10 12
to 0 10 12
"provide 0 10 12
security 0 10 12
guarantees" 0 10 12
to 0 10 12
North 0 10 12
Korea. 0 10 12

But 0 10 13
there 0 10 13
was 0 10 13
no 0 10 13
mentioning 0 10 13
the 0 10 13
previous 0 10 13
US 0 10 13
aim 0 10 13
of 0 10 13
"complete, 0 10 13
verifiable 0 10 13
and 0 10 13
irreversible 0 10 13
denuclearization." 0 10 13

And 0 10 14
Kim's 0 10 14
commitments 0 10 14
did 0 10 14
not 0 10 14
appear 0 10 14
to 0 10 14
go 0 10 14
beyond 0 10 14
what 0 10 14
he 0 10 14
already 0 10 14
pledged 0 10 14
to 0 10 14
do 0 10 14
in 0 10 14
April 0 10 14
when 0 10 14
he 0 10 14
met 0 10 14
South 0 10 14
Korean 0 10 14
President 0 10 14
Moon 0 10 14
Jae-in 0 10 14
along 0 10 14
their 0 10 14
countries' 0 10 14
border. 0 10 14

Trump 0 10 15
insisted 0 10 15
during 0 10 15
a 0 10 15
news 0 10 15
conference 0 10 15
the 0 10 15
agreement 0 10 15
went 0 10 15
further 0 10 15
than 0 10 15
many 0 10 15
people 0 10 15
expected. 0 10 15

But 0 10 16
he 0 10 16
acknowledged 0 10 16
the 0 10 16
effort 0 10 16
to 0 10 16
rid 0 10 16
North 0 10 16
Korea 0 10 16
of 0 10 16
its 0 10 16
nuclear 0 10 16
arsenal 0 10 16
was 0 10 16
in 0 10 16
its 0 10 16
early 0 10 16
stages. 0 10 16

"We 0 10 17
will 0 10 17
do 0 10 17
it 0 10 17
as 0 10 17
fast 0 10 17
as 0 10 17
it 0 10 17
can 0 10 17
mechanically 0 10 17
and 0 10 17
physically 0 10 17
be 0 10 17
done," 0 10 17
he 0 10 17
said. 0 10 17

More 0 10 18
critical, 0 10 18
in 0 10 18
Trump's 0 10 18
telling, 0 10 18
was 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
development 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
a 0 10 18
personal 0 10 18
bond 0 10 18
with 0 10 18
Kim, 0 10 18
a 0 10 18
brutal 1 10 18
dictator 1 10 18
responsible 0 10 18
for 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
deaths 0 10 18
not 0 10 18
only 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
his 0 10 18
own 0 10 18
citizens 0 10 18
but 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
at 0 10 18
least 0 10 18
one 0 10 18
American, 0 10 18
Otto 0 10 18
Warmbier, 0 10 18
who 0 10 18
was 0 10 18
returned 0 10 18
to 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
US 0 10 18
in 0 10 18
a 0 10 18
coma 0 10 18
only 0 10 18
to 0 10 18
die 0 10 18
days 0 10 18
later. 0 10 18

"I 0 10 19
think 0 10 19
our 0 10 19
whole 0 10 19
relationship 0 10 19
with 0 10 19
North 0 10 19
Korea 0 10 19
and 0 10 19
the 0 10 19
Korean 0 10 19
Peninsula 0 10 19
is 0 10 19
going 0 10 19
to 0 10 19
be 0 10 19
a 0 10 19
very 0 10 19
much 0 10 19
different 0 10 19
situation 0 10 19
than 0 10 19
it 0 10 19
has 0 10 19
in 0 10 19
the 0 10 19
past," 0 10 19
Trump 0 10 19
said 0 10 19
during 0 10 19
the 0 10 19
summit. 0 10 19

Later, 0 10 20
during 0 10 20
his 0 10 20
news 0 10 20
conference, 0 10 20
Trump 0 10 20
said 0 10 20
Warmbier's 0 10 20
death 0 10 20
contributed 0 10 20
to 0 10 20
the 0 10 20
summit 0 10 20
taking 0 10 20
place. 0 10 20

"Without 0 10 21
Otto, 0 10 21
this 0 10 21
would 0 10 21
not 0 10 21
have 0 10 21
happened," 0 10 21
Trump 0 10 21
said. 0 10 21

Trump 0 10 22
and 0 10 22
Kim 0 10 22
-- 0 10 22
both 0 10 22
intent 0 10 22
on 0 10 22
making 0 10 22
history 0 10 22
-- 0 10 22
greeted 0 10 22
each 0 10 22
other 0 10 22
early 0 10 22
in 0 10 22
the 0 10 22
day 0 10 22
with 0 10 22
extended 0 10 22
hands 0 10 22
in 0 10 22
front 0 10 22
of 0 10 22
a 0 10 22
row 0 10 22
of 0 10 22
US 0 10 22
and 0 10 22
North 0 10 22
Korean 0 10 22
flags, 0 10 22
a 0 10 22
previously 0 10 22
unthinkable 1 10 22
sight 0 10 22
that 0 10 22
reflects 0 10 22
a 0 10 22
new 0 10 22
chapter 0 10 22
in 0 10 22
the 0 10 22
two 0 10 22
countries' 0 10 22
acrimonious 1 10 22
relationship. 0 10 22

Trump's 0 10 23
threats 0 10 23
to 0 10 23
politely 0 10 23
walk 0 10 23
out 0 10 23
of 0 10 23
the 0 10 23
meeting 0 10 23
if 0 10 23
his 0 10 23
expectations 0 10 23
were 0 10 23
unmet 0 10 23
did 0 10 23
not 0 10 23
materialize. 0 10 23

Instead 0 10 24
he 0 10 24
predicted 0 10 24
he 0 10 24
could 0 10 24
"solve 0 10 24
a 0 10 24
big 1 10 24
problem, 1 10 24
a 0 10 24
big 1 10 24
dilemma" 1 10 24
alongside 0 10 24
his 0 10 24
new 0 10 24
partner. 0 10 24

"Working 1 10 25
together, 1 10 25
we'll 1 10 25
get 1 10 25
it 1 10 25
taken 1 10 25
care 1 10 25
of," 1 10 25
Trump 0 10 25
said. 0 10 25

The 0 10 26
remarks 0 10 26
came 0 10 26
amid 0 10 26
an 0 10 26
improbable 0 10 26
series 0 10 26
of 0 10 26
events 0 10 26
that 0 10 26
few 0 10 26
could 0 10 26
have 0 10 26
anticipated 0 10 26
even 0 10 26
three 0 10 26
months 0 10 26
ago. 0 10 26

The 0 10 27
unlikely 0 10 27
images 0 10 27
of 0 10 27
US 0 10 27
and 0 10 27
North 0 10 27
Korean 0 10 27
counterparts 0 10 27
engaging 0 10 27
in 0 10 27
friendly 0 10 27
dialogue 0 10 27
lent 0 10 27
the 0 10 27
day 0 10 27
an 0 10 27
air 0 10 27
of 0 10 27
unreality. 0 10 27

In 0 10 28
a 0 10 28
detailed 0 10 28
menu, 0 10 28
the 0 10 28
White 0 10 28
House 0 10 28
said 0 10 28
the 0 10 28

Other 0 10 29
unforeseen 0 10 29
events 0 10 29
also 0 10 29
surrounded 0 10 29
the 0 10 29
summit, 0 10 29
increasing 1 10 29
the 1 10 29
drama. 1 10 29

Minutes 0 10 30
before 0 10 30
the 0 10 30
historic 1 10 30
handshake, 0 10 30
Trump 0 10 30
tweeted 0 10 30
that 0 10 30
his 0 10 30
top 0 10 30
economic 0 10 30
adviser 0 10 30
Larry 0 10 30
Kudlow 0 10 30
had 0 10 30
suffered 0 10 30
a 0 10 30
heart 0 10 30
attack. 0 10 30

Immediately 0 10 31
after 0 10 31
the 0 10 31
encounter, 0 10 31
Dennis 0 10 31
Rodman 0 10 31
-- 0 10 31
one 0 10 31
of 0 10 31
the 0 10 31
only 0 10 31
Americans 0 10 31
to 0 10 31
have 0 10 31
met 0 10 31
Kim 0 10 31
-- 0 10 31
was 0 10 31
openly 0 10 31
weeping 0 10 31
while 0 10 31
being 0 10 31
interviewed 0 10 31
by 0 10 31
CNN's 0 10 31
Chris 0 10 31
Cuomo. 0 10 31

Even 0 10 32
Kim 0 10 32
seemed 0 10 32
to 0 10 32
acknowledge 0 10 32
the 0 10 32
surreality 1 10 32
of 0 10 32
the 0 10 32
day. 0 10 32

"Many 0 10 33
people 0 10 33
in 0 10 33
the 0 10 33
world 0 10 33
will 0 10 33

from 0 10 33
a 0 10 33
science 0 10 33
fiction 0 10 33
movie," 0 10 33
his 0 10 33
translator 0 10 33
was 0 10 33
overheard 0 10 33
saying 0 10 33
as 0 10 33
the 0 10 33
two 0 10 33
leaders 0 10 33
walked 0 10 33
down 0 10 33
a 0 10 33
white-columned 0 10 33
colonnade. 0 10 33

At 0 10 34
the 0 10 34
conclusion 0 10 34
of 0 10 34
the 0 10 34
summit, 0 10 34
Trump 0 10 34
hailed 1 10 34
the 0 10 34
talks 0 10 34
as 0 10 34
a 0 10 34
historic, 1 10 34
and 0 10 34
personal, 0 10 34
achievement. 0 10 34

"We 0 10 35
learned 0 10 35
a 0 10 35
lot 0 10 35
about 0 10 35
each 0 10 35
other 0 10 35
and 0 10 35
our 0 10 35
countries," 0 10 35
Trump 0 10 35
said. 0 10 35

"I 0 10 36
learned 0 10 36
he's 0 10 36
a 0 10 36
very 1 10 36
talented 1 10 36
man." 1 10 36

When 0 10 37
pressed 0 10 37
about 0 10 37
those 0 10 37
comments 0 10 37
in 0 10 37
light 0 10 37
of 0 10 37
Kim's 0 10 37
brutal 1 10 37
tactics, 0 10 37
Trump 0 10 37
continued 0 10 37
praising 1 10 37
the 0 10 37
North 0 10 37
Korean 0 10 37
leaders' 0 10 37
ability 0 10 37

"He 0 10 38
is 0 10 38
very 1 10 38
talented," 1 10 38
Trump 0 10 38
said, 0 10 38
citing 0 10 38
Kim's 0 10 38
ability 0 10 38
to 0 10 38
"take 0 10 38
over 0 10 38
a 0 10 38
situation 0 10 38

did 0 10 38
at 0 10 38
26 0 10 38
years 0 10 38
of 0 10 38

run 0 10 38
it 0 10 38
tough." 0 10 38

Kim 0 10 39
assumed 0 10 39
power 0 10 39
after 0 10 39
his 0 10 39
father 0 10 39
Kim 0 10 39
Jong 0 10 39
Il, 0 10 39
also 0 10 39
a 0 10 39
brutal 1 10 39
dictator, 1 10 39
died 0 10 39
in 0 10 39
2011. 0 10 39

Throughout 0 10 40
the 0 10 40
day, 0 10 40
Trump 0 10 40
and 0 10 40
Kim's 0 10 40
body 0 10 40
language 0 10 40
was 0 10 40
openly 0 10 40
friendly, 0 10 40
a 0 10 40
striking 1 10 40
warmth 0 10 40
given 0 10 40
Kim's 0 10 40
iron 0 10 40
grip 0 10 40
on 0 10 40
power 0 10 40
and 0 10 40
dismal 0 10 40
record 0 10 40
on 0 10 40
human 0 10 40
rights. 0 10 40

Trump's 0 10 41
move 0 10 41
to 0 10 41
meet 0 10 41
him 0 10 41
attracted 0 10 41
fierce 1 10 41
criticism 1 10 41
for 0 10 41
normalizing 0 10 41
a 0 10 41
regime 0 10 41
routinely 0 10 41
called 0 10 41
out 0 10 41
for 0 10 41
its 0 10 41
human 0 10 41
rights 0 10 41
abuses, 0 10 41
that 0 10 41
over 0 10 41
years 0 10 41
has 0 10 41
built 0 10 41
an 0 10 41
image 0 10 41
of 0 10 41
fearsome 1 10 41
renegade 1 10 41
regime, 0 10 41
throwing 0 10 41
around 0 10 41
threats 0 10 41
of 0 10 41
nuclear 0 10 41
war. 0 10 41

The 0 10 42
day 0 10 42
began 0 10 42
with 0 10 42
Trump 0 10 42
patting 0 10 42
Kim 0 10 42
on 0 10 42
the 0 10 42
back 0 10 42
and 0 10 42
placing 0 10 42
his 0 10 42
hand 0 10 42
on 0 10 42
the 0 10 42
North 0 10 42
Korean's 0 10 42
shoulder 0 10 42
as 0 10 42
they 0 10 42
walked 0 10 42
into 0 10 42
their 0 10 42
first 0 10 42
meeting. 0 10 42

Later 0 10 43
they 0 10 43
were 0 10 43
seen 0 10 43
smiling 0 10 43
and 0 10 43
laughing 0 10 43
over 0 10 43
lunch. 0 10 43

Trump 0 10 44
told 0 10 44
reporters 0 10 44
he 0 10 44
would 0 10 44
"absolutely" 1 10 44
extend 0 10 44
an 0 10 44
invitation 0 10 44
to 0 10 44
the 0 10 44
White 0 10 44
House 0 10 44
to 0 10 44
Kim, 0 10 44
who 0 10 44
also 0 10 44
heralded 1 10 44
a 1 10 44
new 1 10 44
era. 1 10 44

"Today, 0 10 45
we 0 10 45
had 0 10 45
a 0 10 45
historic 1 10 45
meeting 0 10 45
and 0 10 45
decided 0 10 45
to 0 10 45
leave 0 10 45
the 0 10 45
past 0 10 45
behind," 0 10 45
Kim 0 10 45
said 0 10 45
through 0 10 45
a 0 10 45
translator. 0 10 45

"The 1 10 46
world 1 10 46
will 0 10 46
see 0 10 46
a 0 10 46
major 0 10 46
change." 0 10 46

The 0 10 47
meeting 0 10 47
came 0 10 47
only 0 10 47
months 0 10 47
after 0 10 47
the 0 10 47
two 0 10 47
men 0 10 47
traded 0 10 47
nuclear 0 10 47
taunts, 0 10 47
ratcheting 0 10 47
up 0 10 47
tensions 0 10 47
and 0 10 47
leading 0 10 47
to 0 10 47
fears 0 10 47
of 0 10 47
war. 0 10 47

By 0 10 48
contrast, 0 10 48
Trump 0 10 48
appeared 0 10 48
to 0 10 48
back 0 10 48
off 0 10 48
a 0 10 48
military 0 10 48
footing 0 10 48
on 0 10 48
Tuesday, 0 10 48
declaring 0 10 48
the 0 10 48
US 0 10 48
will 0 10 48
stop 0 10 48
the 0 10 48
"war 0 10 48
games," 0 10 48
an 0 10 48
apparent 0 10 48
reference 0 10 48
to 0 10 48
joint 0 10 48
military 0 10 48
exercises 0 10 48
with 0 10 48
South 0 10 48
Korea 0 10 48
that 0 10 48
North 0 10 48
Korea 0 10 48
has 0 10 48
long 0 10 48
rebuked 0 10 48
as 0 10 48
provocative. 0 10 48

Trump 0 10 49
also 0 10 49
said 0 10 49
he 0 10 49
hopes 0 10 49
to 0 10 49
eventually 0 10 49
withdraw 0 10 49
US 0 10 49
forces 0 10 49
from 0 10 49
South 0 10 49
Korea, 0 10 49
but 0 10 49
said 0 10 49
"that's 0 10 49
not 0 10 49
part 0 10 49
of 0 10 49
the 0 10 49
equation 0 10 49
right 0 10 49
now." 0 10 49

"I 0 10 50
want 0 10 50
to 0 10 50
get 0 10 50
our 1 10 50
soldiers 1 10 50
out. 0 10 50

I 0 10 51
want 0 10 51
to 0 10 51
bring 0 10 51
our 1 10 51
soldiers 1 10 51
back 0 10 51
home," 0 10 51
Trump 0 10 51
said. 0 10 51

"But 0 10 52
that's 0 10 52
not 0 10 52
part 0 10 52
of 0 10 52
the 0 10 52
equation 0 10 52
right 0 10 52
now. 0 10 52

I 0 10 53
hope 0 10 53
it 0 10 53
will 0 10 53
be 0 10 53
eventually." 0 10 53

Tuesday's 0 10 54
meeting, 0 10 54
convened 0 10 54
at 0 10 54
a 0 10 54
luxury 0 10 54
hotel 0 10 54
on 0 10 54
the 0 10 54
island 0 10 54
of 0 10 54
Sentosa, 0 10 54
came 0 10 54
just 0 10 54
three 0 10 54
months 0 10 54
after 0 10 54
Trump 0 10 54
accepted 0 10 54
North 0 10 54
Korea's 0 10 54
invitation 0 10 54
for 0 10 54
talks 0 10 54
on 0 10 54
the 0 10 54
spot. 0 10 54

It 0 10 55
was 0 10 55
an 0 10 55
extraordinarily 0 10 55
compressed 0 10 55
timeline 0 10 55
for 0 10 55
the 0 10 55
landmark 0 10 55
summit, 0 10 55
which 0 10 55
at 0 10 55
one 0 10 55
point 0 10 55
was 0 10 55
called 0 10 55
off 0 10 55
entirely 0 10 55
as 0 10 55
communication 0 10 55
broke 0 10 55
down 0 10 55
between 0 10 55
Washington 0 10 55
and 0 10 55
Pyongyang. 0 10 55

The 0 10 56
talks 0 10 56
were 0 10 56
quickly 0 10 56
revived, 0 10 56
leading 0 10 56
to 0 10 56
the 0 10 56
highly 0 10 56
choreographed 0 10 56
event 0 10 56
that 0 10 56
unfolded 0 10 56
Tuesday. 0 10 56

After 0 10 57
the 0 10 57
men 0 10 57
shook 0 10 57
hands, 0 10 57
they 0 10 57
repaired 0 10 57
inside 0 10 57
for 0 10 57
one-on-one 0 10 57
talks. 0 10 57

In 0 10 58
that 0 10 58
first 0 10 58
meeting 0 10 58
they 0 10 58
were 0 10 58
joined 0 10 58
only 0 10 58
by 0 10 58
translators, 0 10 58
a 0 10 58
break 0 10 58
from 0 10 58
standard 0 10 58
practice 0 10 58
of 0 10 58
having 0 10 58
at 0 10 58
least 0 10 58
one 0 10 58
aide 0 10 58
present 0 10 58
for 0 10 58
high-stakes 0 10 58
huddles. 0 10 58

Later 0 10 59
in 0 10 59
the 0 10 59
day, 0 10 59
advisers 0 10 59
joined 0 10 59
the 0 10 59
talks 0 10 59
for 0 10 59
a 0 10 59
larger 0 10 59
bilateral 0 10 59
session 0 10 59
and 0 10 59
a 0 10 59
working 0 10 59
lunch. 0 10 59

Trump 0 10 60
took 0 10 60
keen 0 10 60
interest 0 10 60
in 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
pageantry 0 10 60
of 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
day, 0 10 60
insisting 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
pictures 0 10 60
beamed 0 10 60
around 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
world 0 10 60
reflect 0 10 60
a 0 10 60
commanding 1 10 60
leader 1 10 60
making 0 10 60
a 0 10 60
decisive, 0 10 60
world-altering 1 10 60
move. 0 10 60

At 0 10 61
the 0 10 61
same 0 10 61
time, 0 10 61
he'd 0 10 61
admitted 0 10 61
he 0 10 61
didn't 0 10 61
believe 0 10 61
he 0 10 61
required 0 10 61
extensive 0 10 61
preparation 0 10 61
to 0 10 61
take 0 10 61
stock 0 10 61
of 0 10 61
Kim. 0 10 61

As 0 10 62
part 0 10 62
of 0 10 62
the 0 10 62
advance 0 10 62
work, 0 10 62
Trump 0 10 62
commissioned 0 10 62
a 0 10 62
highly 0 10 62
produced 0 10 62
video 0 10 62
meant 0 10 62
to 0 10 62
convince 0 10 62
Kim 0 10 62
to 0 10 62
relinquish 0 10 62
his 0 10 62
weapons 0 10 62
and 0 10 62
open 0 10 62
his 0 10 62
country 0 10 62
to 0 10 62
outside 0 10 62
investment. 0 10 62

Trump 0 10 63
showed 0 10 63
Kim 0 10 63
the 0 10 63
movie 0 10 63
on 0 10 63
an 0 10 63
iPad 0 10 63
during 0 10 63
their 0 10 63
talks. 0 10 63

Here 0 10 64
in 0 10 64
futuristic 1 10 64
Singapore, 0 10 64
however, 0 10 64
Kim 0 10 64
was 0 10 64
able 0 10 64
to 0 10 64
view 0 10 64
the 0 10 64
benefits 0 10 64
of 0 10 64
economic 0 10 64
advancement 0 10 64
at 0 10 64
close 0 10 64
range. 0 10 64

He 0 10 65
was 0 10 65
spotted 0 10 65
taking 0 10 65
a 0 10 65
moonlit 0 10 65
stroll 0 10 65
around 0 10 65
the 0 10 65
high-end 0 10 65
Marina 0 10 65
Bay 0 10 65
Sands 0 10 65
hotel 0 10 65
and 0 10 65
casino, 0 10 65
owned 0 10 65
by 0 10 65
GOP 0 10 65
mega-donor 0 10 65
Sheldon 0 10 65
Adelson, 0 10 65
the 0 10 65
type 0 10 65
of 0 10 65
glitzy 0 10 65
development 0 10 65
few 0 10 65
North 0 10 65
Koreans 0 10 65
could 0 10 65
ever 0 10 65
imagine 0 10 65
coming 0 10 65
to 0 10 65
their 0 10 65
country. 0 10 65

Kim 0 10 65

was 0 10 65

cheered 0 10 65

by 0 10 65

onlookers 0 10 65

who 0 10 65

caught 0 10 65

sight 0 10 65

of 0 10 65

the 0 10 65

dictator, 1 10 65

who 0 10 65

until 0 10 65

earlier 0 10 65

this 0 10 65

spring 0 10 65

was 0 10 65

not 0 10 65

believed 0 10 65

ever 0 10 65

left 0 10 65

North 0 10 65

Korea 0 10 65

as 0 10 65

supreme 0 10 65
