In 0
other 0
words, 0
Trump 0
has 0
not 0
even 0
begun 0
to 0
repair 0
the 0
damage 0
done 0
by 0
eight 0
years 0
of 0
Obama. 0

Native-born 0
American 0
workers 0
lost 0
ground 0
to 0
their 0
foreign-born 0
competitors 0
throughout 0
the 0
Obama 0
years. 0

And, 0
shown 0
above, 0
this 0
trend 0
accelerated 0
significantly 0
in 0
the 0
months 0
leading 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
election. 0

While 0
May 0
was 0
a 1
welcome 1
respite, 1
Trump 0
supporters 0
have 0
reason 0
to 0
complain: 0
Since 0
taking 0
office 0
in 0
January 0
2017 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
presided 0
over 0
a 0
labor 0
market 0
in 0
which 0
immigrants 0
have 0
gained 0
1.006 0
million 0
jobs, 0
a 0
3.9% 0
increase, 0
while 0
native-born 0
Americans 0
gained 0
about 0
2.4 0
million 0
jobs 0
—a 0
rise 0
of 0
only 0
1.9%. 0

As 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
labor 0
market 0
is 0
concerned, 0
“America 1
First” 1
has 0
not 0
translated 0
to 0
Americans 0
First. 0

In 0
normal 0
times, 0
this 0
might 0
be 0
a 0
big 0
story. 0

But 0
the 0
even 0
the 1
conservative 1
non-Main 1
Stream 1
Media 1
is 0
currently 0
too 1
steeped 1
in 1
economic 1
euphoria 1
to 0
notice. 0

Nd 0
anyway, 0
they 0
almost 0
never 0
report 0
the 0
immigration 0
dimension. 0

However, 0
it 0
is 0
now 0
absolutely 0
clear 0
that 0
immigration, 0
and 0
immigrant 0
displacement 0
of 0
American 0
workers, 0
cannot 0
be 0
jawboned 1
away. 1

The 1
only 1
answer 1
is 1
legislation— 1
border 1
wall 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
illegal 1
alien 1
flow; 1
a 1
second 1
Operation 1
Wetback, 1
including 1
E-Verify, 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
illegal 1
alien 1
self-deporting; 1
a 1
moratorium 1
on 1
legal 1
immigration. 1

May 0
2018 0
was 0
the 0
fifth 0
consecutive 0
month 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
foreign-born 0
working 0
age 0
population 0
(including 0

grew 0
by 0
more 0
than 0
1 0
million 0
from 0
the 0

the 0
prior 0

But 0
May’s 0
growth 0
was 0
less 0
than 0
that 0
in 0
April 0
and 0
March, 0
possibly 0
an 0
emerging 0
trend. 0

Can't 0

In 0
May 0
2018 0
there 0
were 0
1.342 0
million 0
more 0
working-age 0
immigrants 0
than 0
in 0
May 0
2017. 0

This 0
comes 1
on 1
the 1
heels 1
of 1
gains 1
of 0
2.154 0
million 0
and 0
1.597 0
million. 0

year-over-year, 0
in 0
March 0
and 0
April, 0
respectively. 0

It’s 0
hard 0
to 0
believe 0
with 1
the 1
evaporation 1
of 0
the 1
Trump 1
Effect, 1
but 0
less 0
than 0
six 0
months 0
ago 0
we 0
were 0
seeing 0
to 0
year-over-year 0
declines 0
in 0
the 0
immigrant 0
workforce 0
population. 0

The 0
last 0
five 0
months 0
of 0
2017 0
saw 0
the 0
foreign-born 0
population 0
fall 0
by 0
an 0
average 0
100,000 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
month 0
of 0
the 0
prior 0
year 0
(shown 0
in 0
red 0
on 0
our 0
chart). 0

These 0
are 0
net 0
figures. 0

Over 0
a 0
12-month 0
period 0
an 0
average 0
of 0
perhaps 0
300,000 0
immigrants 0
die 0
and 0
an 0
equal 0
number 0
leave 0
the 0
U.S. 0
voluntarily. 0

So 0
the 0
1.342 0
million 0
net 0
rise 0
in 0
foreign-born 0
population, 0
May 0
2017 0
to 0
May 0
2018, 0
implies 0
that 0
nearly 0
2 0
million 0
foreign-born 0
individuals 0
may 0
have 0
actually 0
settled 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
over 0
those 0
12 0
months. 0

(This 0
excludes 0
tourists 0
and 0
other 0
short-term 0
entrants.) 0

In 0
percentage 0
terms, 0
the 0
immigrant 0
working-age 0
population 0
grew 0
3.24% 0
over 0
the 0
12 0
months. 0

If 0
this 0
growth 0
rate 0
persists, 0
it 0
portends 0
a 0
doubling 0
in 0
22 0
years. 0

By 0
contrast, 0
the 0
native-born 0
American 0
population 0
rose 0
0.63% 0
over 0
this 0
period 0
—a 0
rate 0
that 0
will 0
require 0
114 0
years 0
for 0
a 0
doubling. 0

If 0
both 0
rates 0
persist 0
that 0
long, 0
the 1
term 1
