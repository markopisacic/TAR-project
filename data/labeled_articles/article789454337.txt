Amber 0 70 1

police 0 70 1

26-year-old 0 70 1
Botham 0 70 1
Jean 0 70 1
in 0 70 1
his 0 70 1
apartment 0 70 1
for 0 70 1
no 0 70 1
reason, 0 70 1
is 0 70 1
a 0 70 1
glaring 0 70 1
example 0 70 1
of 0 70 1
“blue 1 70 1

at 0 70 1

in 0 70 1
our 1 70 1

Guyger 0 70 2
claims 0 70 2
that 0 70 2
she 0 70 2
accidentally 0 70 2
entered 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
wrong 0 70 2
apartment 0 70 2
and 0 70 2
shot 0 70 2
a 0 70 2
man 0 70 2
who 0 70 2
she 0 70 2
thought 0 70 2
was 0 70 2
a 0 70 2
burglar, 0 70 2
however, 0 70 2
eyewitness 0 70 2
testimony 0 70 2
has 0 70 2
contradicted 0 70 2
her 0 70 2
initial 0 70 2
statement. 0 70 2

Despite 0 70 3
admitting 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
killing 0 70 3
an 0 70 3
innocent 1 70 3
man 0 70 3
and 0 70 3
having 0 70 3
her 0 70 3
initial 0 70 3
statement 0 70 3
contradicted 0 70 3
by 0 70 3
witness 0 70 3
testimony, 0 70 3
Guyger 0 70 3
has 0 70 3
been 0 70 3
treated 0 70 3
as 0 70 3
more 0 70 3
of 0 70 3
a 0 70 3
victim 0 70 3
than 0 70 3
a 0 70 3
killer. 0 70 3

In 0 70 4
fact, 0 70 4
Guyger’s 0 70 4
apartment 0 70 4
was 0 70 4
never 0 70 4
even 0 70 4
searched 0 70 4
for 0 70 4
evidence, 0 70 4
and 0 70 4
she 0 70 4
was 0 70 4
allowed 0 70 4
to 0 70 4
“vacate” 0 70 4
the 0 70 4
premises 0 70 4
without 0 70 4
any 0 70 4
type 0 70 4
of 0 70 4
search. 0 70 4

By 0 70 5
not 0 70 5
searching 0 70 5
her 0 70 5
apartment 0 70 5
immediately, 0 70 5
police 0 70 5
ruined 0 70 5
the 0 70 5
investigation, 0 70 5
making 0 70 5
it 0 70 5
harder 0 70 5
to 0 70 5

her. 0 70 5

It 0 70 6
would 0 70 6
be 0 70 6
reasonable 0 70 6
to 0 70 6
assume 0 70 6
that 0 70 6
these 0 70 6
steps 0 70 6
were 0 70 6
taken 0 70 6
intentionally 0 70 6
because 1 70 6
they 1 70 6
want 1 70 6
to 1 70 6
see 1 70 6
her 1 70 6
get 1 70 6

of 0 70 18

is 0 70 19

in 0 70 19
