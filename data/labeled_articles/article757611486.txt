The 0
Islamization 0
of 0
the 0
Public 0
Schools 0

Muslims 0
anxious 0
to 0
use 0
schools 0
and 0
textbooks 0
to 0
proselytize 0
for 0
Islam 0
have 0
found 0
a 0
welcoming 0
environment 0
in 0
American 0
public 0
schools 0
that 0
are 0
indefatigably 0
committed 0
to 0
multiculturalism. 0

With 0
the 0
imperative 0
to 0
be 0
“tolerant” 0
robbing 0
many 0
educators 0
of 0
their 0
ability 0
to 0
evaluate 0
non-Western 0
cultures 0
critically, 0
all 0
too 0
many 0
public 0
schools 0
and 0
individual 0
teachers 0
have 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
susceptible 0
to 0
an 0
organized 0
campaign 0
by 0
U.S.-based 0
Islamic 0
organizations 0
and 0
their 0
primary 0
benefactor, 0
Saudi 0
Arabia, 0
to 0
present 0
a 0
view 0
of 0
Islam 0
that 0
whitewashes 0
its 0
violent 1
history 1
and 0
intolerant 1
doctrines. 1

Many 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
groups 0
that 0
vet 0
American 0
public 0
school 0
textbooks 0
for 0
the 0
accuracy 0
of 0
their 0
material 0
on 0
Islamic 0
doctrine 0
and 0
history 0
are 0
Saudi-funded. 0

They 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
Islamic 0
instruction 0
in 0
these 0
textbooks 0
presents 0
a 0
picture 0
of 0
Islam 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
pristine 0
and 0
whitewashed 0
that 0
it 0
sometimes 0
crosses 0
the 0
boundary 0
from 0
mere 0
pro-Muslim 0
bias 0
into 0
outright 1
Islamic 0
proselytizing. 1

The 0
taboo 0
about 0
teaching 0
religion 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
schools, 0
so 0
zealously 1
established 0
and 0
guarded 0
against 0

by 0
the 0
ACLU 0
and 0
the 0
Supreme 0

over 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
decades, 0
is 0
increasingly 0
set 0
aside 0
in 0
American 0
public 0
schools, 0
as 0
presentations 0
on 0
Islam 0
frequently 0
cross 0
the 0
line 0

We 0
have 0
seen 0
this 0
just 0
recently, 0
when 0
Mountain 0
Ridge 0
Middle 0
School 0
in 0
Gerrardstown, 0
West 0
Virginia 0
instructed 0
students 0
to 0
copy 0
out 0
the 0
Islamic 0
profession 0
of 0
faith 0
(shahada), 0
ostensibly 0
as 0
a 0
calligraphy 0
exercise. 0

Parent 0
Rich 0
Penkoski 0
recounted: 0
“I 0
saw 0
the 0
assignment 0
of 0
writing 0
the 0
Shahada 0
in 0
Arabic. 0

Their 0
excuse 0
was 0
calligraphy. 0

I 0
was 0
like, 0
‘Whoa! 1

Whoa! 1

Whoa!’ 1
First 0
of 0
all, 0
calligraphy 0
was 0
invented 0
in 0
China 0
3,000 0
years 0
prior 0
to 0
Muhammad. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
my 0
daughter 0
to 0
write 0
that 0
disturbed 0
me. 0

I 0
said, 0
‘That 0
is 0
not 0
happening. 0

My 0
daughter 0
is 0
not 0
doing 0
that.’ 0
My 0
daughter 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
if 0
she 0
didn’t 0
do 0
the 0
assignment, 0
then 0
she 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
[detention] 0
slip.” 0

Branch 0
contradicted 0
Penkoski, 0
claiming: 0
“The 0
teacher 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
several 0
times 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
study 0
of 0
world 0
religions 0
and 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
trying 0
to 0
advocate 0
for 0
any 0
religion 0
over 0
another. 0

She 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
had 0
questions 0
about 0
religious 0
beliefs, 0
that 0
those 0
conversations 0
should 0
take 0
place 0
with 0
their 0
parents.” 0
He 0
said 0
that 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
were 0
given 0
“equitable 0
treatment” 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
class. 0

Penkoski’s 0
daughter, 0
Brielle, 0
however, 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
class 0
spent 0
much 0
less 0
time 0
on 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
than 0
it 0
did 0
on 0
Islam. 0

Penkoski 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
accompanying 0
exercises 0
were 0
also 0
less 0
extensive 0
for 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
than 0
they 0
were 0
for 0
Islam: 0
“Notice 0
no 0
Bible 0
verses, 0
no 0
reciting 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments 0
or 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer. 0

[There’s] 0
no 0
practicing 0
writing 0
in 0
Hebrew 0
as 0
compared 0
to 0
the 0
Islamic 0
packet.” 0

This 0
stealth 0
proselytizing 1
is 0
nationwide. 0

Last 0
January, 0
parents 0
filed 0
a 0
federal 0
complaint 0
against 0
Chatham 0
Middle 0
School 0
in 0
Chatham, 0
New 0
Jersey, 0
for 0
forcing 0
students 0
to 0
watch 0
videos 0
that 0
proselytized 1
for 0
Islam. 0

One 0
video, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
complaint, 0
describes 0
“Christians 0
and 0
Jews 0
as 0
‘infidels’ 1
and 0
prais[es] 0
Muhammad 0
in 0
gruesome 1
detail 0
for 0
slaughtering 1
them.” 0
Parent 0
Libby 0
Hilsenrath 0
characterized 0
the 0
accompanying 0
assignment 0
as 0
“replete 0
with 0
biased, 0
chastising 1
statements 0
encouraging 0
the 0
students…to 0
follow 0
the 0
Quran 0
and 0
become 0
Muslim.” 0
Another 0
video, 0
according 0
to 0
Hilsenrath, 0
depicts 0
a 0
Muslim 0
boy 0
teaching 0
his 0
non-Muslim 0
friend 0
about 0
Islam, 0
after 0
which 0
both 0
go 0
to 0
“learn 0
how 0
to 0
pray.” 0

The 0
complaint 0
adds: 0
“Due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
these 0
doctrinal 0
messages 0
calling 0
for 0
conversion 0
to 0
Islam 0
were 0
included 0
in 0
video 0
format 0
with 0
vivid 0
images 0
and 0
text, 0
they 0
possess 0
greater 0
communicative 0
impact 0
and 0
are 0
more 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
accepted 0
by 0
the 0
students 0
viewing 0
them 0
than 0
information 0
that 0
is 0
spoken 0
in 0
a 0
classroom 0
or 0
even 0
written 0
in 0
a 0
book.” 0

These 0
accounts 0
are 0
not 0
singular. 0

High 0
school 0
students 0
in 0
Newton, 0
Massachusetts 0
in 0
October 0
2017, 0
according 0
to 0
Fox 0
News, 0
“pretended 0
to 0
be 0
Muslims 0
in 0
the 0
‘Islamic’ 0
city 0
of 0
Jerusalem 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
class 0
assignment.” 0
The 0
assignment 0
also 0
included 0
a 0
pro-Palestinian, 0
anti-Israel 0
article. 0

Judicial 0
Watch 0
Senior 0
Investigator 0
Bill 0
Marshall 0
remarked: 0
“Citizens 0
of 0
Newton 0
have 0
been 0
waging 0
a 0
minor 0
war 0
with 0
school 0
officials 0
for 0
years 0
now, 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
to 0
use 0
balanced 0
curriculum 0
in 0
their 0
teaching 0
materials 0
on 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
Islam 0
and 0
the 0
Israeli-Palestinian 0
conflict.” 0
Dr. 0
Bill 0
Saxton, 0
chairman 0
of 0
Citizens 0
for 0
National 0
Security, 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
assignment 0
was 0
a 0
“purposeful 0
attempt 0
to 0
indoctrinate 1
our 0
impressionable 0
high-schoolers 0
with 0
the 0
‘virtues’ 0
of 0
Islam 0
at 0
the 0
expense 0
of 0
Christianity, 0
Judaism 0
and 0
other 0
religions.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
Georgia 0
parent 0
Michelle 0
King 0
noted 0
in 0
2016: 0
“My 0
daughter 0
had 0
to 0
learn 0
the 0
Shahid 0
and 0
the 0
Five 0
Pillars 0
of 0
Islam, 0
which 0
is 0
what 0
you 0
learn 0
to 0
convert,” 0
while 0
not 0
teaching 0
Christianity 0
or 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments. 0

One 0
homework 0
assignment 0
in 0
Walton 0
County, 0
Georgia, 0
stated: 0
“Allah 0
is 0
the 0
[blank] 0
worshiped 0
by 0
Jews 0
& 0
Christians,” 0
with 0
students 0
having 0
to 0
fill 0
in 0
the 0
blank 0
with 0
“same 0
God.” 0

Parent 0
Steve 0
Alsup 0
added: 0
“It 0
seemed 0
like 0
half 0
the 0
truth 0
to 0
me, 0
they 0
didn’t 0
talk 0
about 0
the 0
extreme 1
Islamics.” 1
Kim 0
Embry, 0
a 0
spokesperson 0
for 0
Walton 0
County 0
Public 0
Schools, 0
said 0
revealingly: 0
“We 0
are 0
teaching 0
the 0
same 0
stuff 0
that 0
everyone 0
else 0
is 0
teaching.” 0

Indeed. 0

In 0
2015, 0
students 0
at 0
Spring 0
Hill 0
Middle 0
School 0
in 0
Spring 0
Hill, 0
Tennessee 0
were 0
forced 1
as 0
part 0
of 0
an 0
assignment 0
to 0
write, 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
god 0
but 0
Allah; 0
Muhammad 0
is 0
his 0
prophet.” 0
Mother 0
Joy 0
Ellis 0
remarked: 0
“This 0
is 0
a 0
seventh 0
grade 0
state 0
standard, 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
TCAP. 0

I 0
didn’t 0
have 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
Islam 0
being 0
taught, 0
but 0
to 0
go 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
make 0
my 0
child 0
write 0
the 0
Shahada, 0
is 0
unacceptable.” 1
Another 0
mother, 0
Brandee 0
Porterfield, 0
observed: 0
“It 0
really 0
did 0
bother 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
skipped 0
the 0
whole 0
chapter 0
on 0
the 0
rise 0
of 0
Christianity 0
and 0
they 0
spent 0
three 0
weeks 0
just 0
studying 0
Islam….I 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
teacher 0
and 0
the 0
principal,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“They 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
learn 0
any 0
other 0
religion, 0
doctrines 0
or 0
creeds 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
back 0
over 0
this 0
chapter. 0

Even 0
though 0
they 0
discuss 0
Christianity 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
during 0
the 0
Middle 0
Ages, 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
ever 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
this 0
basis 0
for 0
Judaism 0
or 0
Christianity 0
later.” 0

Maury 0
County 0
Director 0
of 0
Schools, 0
Chris 0
Marczak, 0
defended 0
the 0
curriculum: 0
“It 0
is 0
our 0
job 0
as 0
a 0
public 0
school 0
system 0
to 0
educate 0
our 0
students 0
on 0
world 0
history 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
be 0
ready 0
to 0
compete 0
in 0
a 0
global 0
society, 0
not 0
to 0
endorse 0
one 0
religion 0
over 0
another 0
or 0
indoctrinate.” 1
Porterfield, 0
however, 0
shot 0
back: 0
“They 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
over 0
anything 0
else. 0

So 0
for 0
the 0
students 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
memorize 0
this 0
prayer, 0
it 0
does 0
seem 0
like 0
it 0
is 0
indoctrination.” 1

None 0
of 0
the 0
encroachments 0
of 0
Islam 0
in 0
public 0
schools 0
should 0
come 0
as 0
any 0
real 0
surprise. 0

Multiculturalism, 0
after 0
all, 0
amounts 0
to 0
respect 0
for 0
every 0
culture 0
except 0
one’s 0
own. 0

The 0
embarrassment, 0
regret, 0
and 0
even 0
self-hatred 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
inculcated 0
in 0
American 0
public 0
school 0
students 0
for 0
decades 0
now 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
vacuum, 0
which 0
Muslims 0
have 0
shown 0
themselves 0
to 0
be 0
all 0
too 0
eager 0
to 0
fill. 0

Certainly, 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
furthering 0
the 0
Islamization 0
of 0
the 0
schools 0
would 0
deny 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
see 0
Islamic 0
law 0
implemented 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and 0
would 0
indignantly 0
reject 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
their 0
efforts 0
were 0
furthering 0
that 0
end 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

They 0
would 0
say 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
doing 0
it 0
all 0
for 0
tolerance, 0
pluralism, 0
and 0
multiculturalism. 0

Unfortunately, 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
it 0
amounts 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
thing. 0
