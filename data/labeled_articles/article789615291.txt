appeasing 0 45 2

This 0 45 3
timeless 0 45 3
truth 0 45 3
of 0 45 3
human 0 45 3
nature 0 45 3
is 0 45 3
one 0 45 3
that 0 45 3
we 0 45 3

can’t 0 45 3
seem 0 45 3
to 0 45 3
accept. 0 45 3

We 0 45 4
reflexively 0 45 4
assume 0 45 4
that 0 45 4
a 0 45 4
rational 0 45 4
accommodation 0 45 4
or 0 45 4
concessions 0 45 4
will 0 45 4

Senator 0 45 7
Dianne 0 45 7
Feinstein 0 45 7
sat 0 45 7
for 0 45 7
months 0 45 7
on 0 45 7
Ford’s 0 45 7
letter 0 45 7
and 0 45 7
then––just 0 45 7
as 0 45 7
the 1 45 7
Dems 1 45 7
did 0 45 7
in 0 45 7
1991with 0 45 7
Anita 0 45 7
Hill’s 0 45 7
charges 0 45 7

against 0 45 7
Clarence 0 45 7

during 0 45 7
his 0 45 7

it 0 45 7
only 0 45 7
when 0 45 7
Kavanaugh 0 45 7
appeared 0 45 7
to 0 45 7
be 0 45 7
heading 0 45 7
for 0 45 7
confirmation. 0 45 7

Feinstein 0 45 8
still 0 45 8
hasn’t 0 45 8
given 0 45 8
the 0 45 8
Judiciary 0 45 8
Committee 0 45 8
an 0 45 8
unredacted 0 45 8
copy 0 45 8
of 0 45 8
the 0 45 8
letter. 0 45 8

A 0 45 9
few 0 45 9
weeks 0 45 9
after 0 45 9
Ford 0 45 9
went 0 45 9
public, 0 45 9
and 0 45 9
after 0 45 9
Kavanaugh 0 45 9
said 0 45 9
he 0 45 9
had 0 45 9
dairies 0 45 9
from 0 45 9
that 0 45 9
summer 0 45 9
detailing 0 45 9
his 0 45 9
whereabouts, 0 45 9
The 0 45 9
New 0 45 9
Yorker 0 45 9
published 0 45 9
Ramirez’s 0 45 9
account 0 45 9
of 0 45 9
a 0 45 9
drunken 0 45 9
party 0 45 9
filled 0 45 9
with 0 45 9
obscene 0 45 9
drinking 0 45 9
games 0 45 9
where 0 45 9
he 0 45 9
exposed 0 45 9
himself 0 45 9
to 0 45 9
Ramirez. 0 45 9

Given 0 45 10
that 0 45 10
the 0 45 10
Democrats 0 45 10
had 0 45 10
made 0 45 10
public 0 45 10
in 0 45 10
advance 0 45 10
their 0 45 10
intention 0 45 10
to 0 45 10
derail 0 45 10
the 0 45 10
hearings 0 45 10
and 0 45 10
confirmation 0 45 10
by 0 45 10
any 0 45 10
means 0 45 10
possible, 0 45 10
the 0 45 10
timing 0 45 10
of 0 45 10
both 0 45 10
sexual 0 45 10
assault 0 45 10
charges 0 45 10
reeks 1 45 10
of 1 45 10
premeditated 0 45 10
contrivance 0 45 10
intended 0 45 10
to 0 45 10
delay 0 45 10
confirmation 0 45 10
as 0 45 10
long 0 45 10
as 0 45 10
possible. 0 45 10

But 0 45 11
in 0 45 11
the 0 45 11
face 0 45 11
of 0 45 11
this 0 45 11
naked 1 45 11
ploy 1 45 11
to 0 45 11
bork 0 45 11
Kavanaugh 0 45 11
and 0 45 11
derail 0 45 11
the 0 45 11
confirmation 0 45 11
process 0 45 11
for 0 45 11
partisan 0 45 11
advantage, 0 45 11
the 0 45 11
Republicans 0 45 11
seem 0 45 11
to 0 45 11
be 0 45 11
reverting 0 45 11
to 0 45 11
their 0 45 11
customary 1 45 11
preemptive 1 45 11
cringe. 1 45 11

All 0 45 12
the 1 45 12
Dems 1 45 12
have 0 45 12
to 0 45 12
do 0 45 12
is 1 45 12
squeal 1 45 12
“sexism” 0 45 12
and 0 45 12
Republicans 0 45 12
start 0 45 12
negotiating 0 45 12
and 0 45 12
offering 0 45 12
concessions. 0 45 12

Of 0 45 13
course, 0 45 13
after 0 45 13
each 0 45 13
concession 0 45 13
comes 0 45 13
another 0 45 13
demand. 0 45 13

First 0 45 14
the 1 45 14
Dems 1 45 14
demanded 0 45 14
that 0 45 14
Ford, 0 45 14
a 0 45 14
long-time 0 45 14
Democrat 0 45 14
activist, 0 45 14
“be 0 45 14
heard.” 0 45 14
So 0 45 14
last 0 45 14
week 0 45 14
the 0 45 14
Chairman 0 45 14
of 0 45 14
Judiciary 0 45 14
Committee, 0 45 14
Chuck 0 45 14
Grassley, 0 45 14
granted 0 45 14
another 0 45 14
deadline 0 45 14
extension 0 45 14
for 0 45 14
Ford 0 45 14
to 0 45 14
decide 0 45 14
whether 0 45 14
to 0 45 14
testify 0 45 14
before 0 45 14
the 0 45 14
Committee 0 45 14
on 0 45 14
Monday. 0 45 14

Senator 0 45 15
Dianne 0 45 15
Feinstein 0 45 15
calls 0 45 15
these 0 45 15
concessions 0 45 15
“bullying 1 45 15
deadlines.” 1 45 15
As 0 45 15
Feinstein 0 45 15
put 0 45 15
it, 0 45 15
“Show 0 45 15
some 0 45 15
heart. 0 45 15

Wait 0 45 16
until 0 45 16
Dr. 0 45 16
Ford 0 45 16
feels 0 45 16
that 0 45 16
she 0 45 16
can 0 45 16
come 0 45 16
before 0 45 16
the 0 45 16
committee.” 0 45 16
Ford 0 45 16
doesn’t 0 45 16
“feel” 0 45 16
like 0 45 16
she 0 45 16
can 0 45 16
testify 0 45 16
on 0 45 16
Monday 0 45 16
because 0 45 16
she’s 0 45 16
afraid 0 45 16
of 0 45 16
flying, 0 45 16
despite 0 45 16
offers 0 45 16
from 0 45 16
the 0 45 16
Committee 0 45 16
to 0 45 16
travel 0 45 16
to 0 45 16
her 0 45 16
in 0 45 16
California. 0 45 16

Then 0 45 17
she 0 45 17
feared 0 45 17
for 0 45 17
her 0 45 17
life 0 45 17
because 0 45 17
of 0 45 17
death 0 45 17
threats 0 45 17
––threats 0 45 17
also 0 45 17
made 0 45 17
to 0 45 17
Kavanaugh, 0 45 17
his 0 45 17
wife 0 45 17
and 0 45 17
two 0 45 17
young 0 45 17
daughters–– 0 45 17
so 0 45 17
she 0 45 17
now 0 45 17
demands 0 45 17
enhanced 0 45 17
security 0 45 17
measures. 0 45 17

The 0 45 18
Committee 0 45 18
caved 0 45 18
and 0 45 18
moved 0 45 18
the 0 45 18
date 0 45 18
to 0 45 18
Thursday. 0 45 18

So 0 45 19
of 0 45 19
course, 0 45 19
Grassley 0 45 19
having 0 45 19
been 0 45 19
intimidated 0 45 19
into 0 45 19
giving 0 45 19
Ford 0 45 19
a 0 45 19
chance 0 45 19
to 0 45 19
address 0 45 19
the 0 45 19
Committee, 0 45 19
Ramirez 0 45 19
and 0 45 19
her 0 45 19
handlers 0 45 19
are 0 45 19
now 0 45 19
demanding 0 45 19
the 0 45 19
same 0 45 19
privilege. 0 45 19

“Creepy 1 45 20
Lawyer” 1 45 20
for 0 45 20
porn 0 45 20
star 0 45 20
Stormy 0 45 20
Daniels 0 45 20
claims 0 45 20
to 0 45 20
represent 0 45 20
a 0 45 20
woman 0 45 20
who 0 45 20
also 0 45 20
should 0 45 20
be 0 45 20
allowed 0 45 20
to 0 45 20
testify 0 45 20
to 0 45 20
the 0 45 20
Senate 0 45 20
Committee 0 45 20
about 0 45 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 45 20
partying 0 45 20
habits 0 45 20
while 0 45 20
at 0 45 20
Yale. 0 45 20

We’ll 0 45 21
have 0 45 21
to 0 45 21
see 0 45 21
whether 0 45 21
Grassley 0 45 21
can 0 45 21
find 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
stomach 1 45 21
to 1 45 21
put 1 45 21
an 1 45 21
end 1 45 21
to 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
farce 1 45 21
of 0 45 21
allowing 0 45 21
unsubstantiated 0 45 21
charges 0 45 21
from 0 45 21
Democrat 0 45 21
activists 0 45 21
to 0 45 21
waste 0 45 21
the 0 45 21
Committee’s 0 45 21
time. 0 45 21

Ford 0 45 22
and 0 45 22
Dianne 0 45 22
Feinstein 0 45 22
also 0 45 22
keep 0 45 22
demanding 0 45 22
an 0 45 22
FBI 0 45 22
investigation, 0 45 22
even 0 45 22
though 0 45 22
no 0 45 22
federal 0 45 22
crime 0 45 22
is 0 45 22
being 0 45 22
alleged, 0 45 22
and 0 45 22
any 0 45 22
investigation 0 45 22
36 0 45 22
years 0 45 22
after 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
offense 0 45 22
is 0 45 22
impossible. 0 45 22

Ford 0 45 23
can’t 0 45 23
remember 0 45 23
where 0 45 23
and 0 45 23
when 0 45 23
the 0 45 23
alleged 0 45 23
assault 0 45 23
took 0 45 23
place, 0 45 23
nor 0 45 23
how 0 45 23
she 0 45 23
got 0 45 23
to 0 45 23
or 0 45 23
went 0 45 23
home 0 45 23
from 0 45 23
the 0 45 23
party 0 45 23
where 0 45 23
it 0 45 23
allegedly 0 45 23
occurred. 0 45 23

Her 1 45 24
own 1 45 24
details 1 45 24
of 1 45 24
the 1 45 24
event 1 45 24
don’t 1 45 24
jibe 1 45 24
(Four 1 45 24
boys 1 45 24
or 1 45 24
three? 1 45 24

One 1 45 25
girl 1 45 25
or 1 45 25
two?). 1 45 25

She 0 45 26
told 0 45 26
no 0 45 26
one 0 45 26
about 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
assault 0 45 26
until 0 45 26
30 0 45 26
years 0 45 26
later. 0 45 26

A 0 45 27
“lifelong 0 45 27
friend” 0 45 27
whom 0 45 27
Ford 0 45 27
claims 0 45 27
was 0 45 27
at 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
party 0 45 27
has 0 45 27
denied 0 45 27
any 0 45 27
knowledge 0 45 27
of 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
it, 0 45 27
and 0 45 27
says 0 45 27
she’s 0 45 27
never 0 45 27
met 0 45 27
Kavanaugh. 0 45 27

Another 0 45 28
friend 0 45 28
who 0 45 28
reported 0 45 28
that 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
school 0 45 28
was 0 45 28
abuzz 0 45 28
with 0 45 28
gossip 0 45 28
about 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
attack 0 45 28
(which 0 45 28
apparently 0 45 28
took 0 45 28
place 0 45 28
during 0 45 28
summer 0 45 28
break), 0 45 28
retracted 0 45 28
her 0 45 28
statement. 0 45 28

The 0 45 29
two 0 45 29
men 0 45 29
Ford 0 45 29
named 0 45 29
as 0 45 29
possible 0 45 29
witnesses 0 45 29
to 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
assault 0 45 29
have 0 45 29
contradicter 0 45 29
her 0 45 29
claims 0 45 29
under 0 45 29
oath. 0 45 29

And 0 45 30
the 0 45 30
accused 0 45 30
Judge 0 45 30
Kavanaugh 0 45 30
also 0 45 30
under 0 45 30
oath 0 45 30
vehemently 1 45 30
denies 1 45 30
the 0 45 30
charges. 0 45 30

Given 0 45 31
that 0 45 31
36 0 45 31
years 0 45 31
have 0 45 31
passed 0 45 31
since 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
incident, 0 45 31
and 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
accuser’s 0 45 31
memory 0 45 31
is 0 45 31
so 0 45 31
hazy 0 45 31
and 0 45 31
short 0 45 31
on 0 45 31
coherent 0 45 31
details, 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
FBI 0 45 31
has 0 45 31
nothing 0 45 31
to 0 45 31
investigate. 0 45 31

Ramirez’s 0 45 32
charge 0 45 32
is 0 45 32
even 0 45 32
flimsier. 0 45 32

Here’s 0 45 33

The 0 45 35

not 0 45 35
find 0 45 35
a 0 45 35
single 0 45 35
witness 0 45 35
who 0 45 35
could 0 45 35
put 0 45 35
Kavanaugh 0 45 35
at 0 45 35
the 0 45 35

could 0 45 37
not 0 45 37
find 0 45 37
a 0 45 37
single 0 45 37
person 0 45 37
who 0 45 37

The 0 45 39

accused 0 45 39
of 0 45 39
egging 0 45 39
on 0 45 39
Kavanaugh 0 45 39
denied 0 45 39
Ramirez's 0 45 39
allegations 0 45 39
and 0 45 39
vouched 0 45 39
for 0 45 39

A 0 45 41
third 0 45 41
person 0 45 41
that 0 45 41
Ramirez 0 45 41
claimed 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
at 0 45 41
the 0 45 41
party 0 45 41
says 0 45 41
she 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
not 0 45 41
there 0 45 41
for 0 45 41
the 0 45 41
alleged 0 45 41
incident. 0 45 41

5. 0 45 42

Ramirez 0 45 43
contacted 0 45 43
her 0 45 43
former 0 45 43
classmates, 0 45 43
asking 0 45 43
about 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
incident, 0 45 43
and 0 45 43
admitted 0 45 43
she 0 45 43
was 0 45 43
not 0 45 43
sure 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
Kavanaugh 0 45 43
was 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
male 0 45 43
who 0 45 43
exposed 0 45 43
himself. 0 45 43

6. 0 45 44

A 0 45 45
woman 0 45 45
who 0 45 45
claims 0 45 45
she 0 45 45
was 0 45 45
“best 0 45 45
friends” 0 45 45
with 0 45 45
Ramirez 0 45 45
says 0 45 45
Ramirez 0 45 45
never 0 45 45
mentioned 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
story 0 45 45
and 0 45 45
initially 0 45 45
said 0 45 45
her 0 45 45
friend's 0 45 45
accusations 0 45 45
against 0 45 45
Kavanaugh 0 45 45
might 0 45 45
be 0 45 45
“politically 0 45 45
motivated.” 0 45 45

7. 0 45 46

Ramirez, 0 45 47
just 0 45 47
like 0 45 47
Christine 0 45 47
Blasey 0 45 47
Ford, 0 45 47
is 0 45 47
a 0 45 47
registered 0 45 47
Democrat 0 45 47
and 0 45 47
is 0 45 47
dedicated 0 45 47
to 0 45 47
leftist 0 45 47
causes. 0 45 47

8. 0 45 48

Ramirez 0 45 49
wasn’t 0 45 49
even 0 45 49
sure 0 45 49
her 0 45 49
memory 0 45 49
was 0 45 49
correct 0 45 49
— 0 45 49
until 0 45 49
she 0 45 49
spent 0 45 49
six 0 45 49
days 0 45 49
going 0 45 49
over 0 45 49
it 0 45 49
with 0 45 49
her 1 45 49
Democrat 1 45 49
lawyer. 1 45 49

9. 0 45 50

Ramirez 0 45 51
admits 0 45 51
there 0 45 51
are 0 45 51
holes 0 45 51
in 0 45 51
her 0 45 51
memory 0 45 51
due 0 45 51
to 0 45 51
how 0 45 51
much 0 45 51
she 0 45 51
drank 0 45 51
at 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
party. 0 45 51

10. 0 45 52

People 0 45 53
who 0 45 53
knew 0 45 53
Ramirez 0 45 53
after 0 45 53
her 0 45 53
time 0 45 53
at 0 45 53
Yale 0 45 53
say 0 45 53
that 0 45 53
she 0 45 53
never 0 45 53
once 0 45 53
mentioned 0 45 53
the 0 45 53
incident 0 45 53
— 0 45 53
until 0 45 53
Kavanaugh's 0 45 53
nomination 0 45 53
was 0 45 53
pending. 0 45 53

No 0 45 54
law 0 45 54
enforcement 0 45 54
agency, 0 45 54
let 0 45 54
alone 0 45 54
the 0 45 54
FBI, 0 45 54
would 0 45 54
waste 0 45 54
its 0 45 54
time 0 45 54
with 0 45 54
an 0 45 54
allegation 0 45 54
of 0 45 54
a 0 45 54
crime 0 45 54
decades 0 45 54
in 0 45 54
the 0 45 54
past, 0 45 54
and 0 45 54
so 0 45 54
patently 0 45 54
incoherent 0 45 54
and 0 45 54
lacking 0 45 54
in 0 45 54
evidence. 0 45 54

The 0 45 55
“FBI 0 45 55
investigation” 0 45 55
is 0 45 55
another 0 45 55
delaying 0 45 55
tactic. 0 45 55

Ford 0 45 56
has 0 45 56
finally 0 45 56
agreed 0 45 56
to 0 45 56
testify, 0 45 56
set 0 45 56
for 0 45 56
Thursday 0 45 56
for 0 45 56
now. 0 45 56

But 0 45 57
it’s 0 45 57
unclear 0 45 57
whether 0 45 57
Grassley 0 45 57
has 0 45 57
granted 0 45 57
Ford 0 45 57
any 0 45 57
of 0 45 57
her 0 45 57
preposterous 1 45 57
conditions 1 45 57
for 0 45 57
testifying: 0 45 57
She 0 45 57
will 0 45 57
take 0 45 57
questions 0 45 57
from 0 45 57
the 0 45 57
Committee, 0 45 57
but 0 45 57
not 0 45 57
from 0 45 57
outside 0 45 57
lawyers, 0 45 57
who 0 45 57
might 0 45 57
not 0 45 57
be 0 45 57
as 0 45 57
gentle 0 45 57
as 0 45 57
politicians 1 45 57
with 1 45 57
one 1 45 57
eye 1 45 57
on 1 45 57
the 1 45 57
polls. 1 45 57

Only 0 45 58
one 0 45 58
camera 0 45 58
can 0 45 58
be 0 45 58
in 0 45 58
the 0 45 58
room. 0 45 58

Kavanaugh 0 45 59
must 0 45 59
testify 0 45 59
first, 0 45 59
a 1 45 59
grotesque 1 45 59
inversion 1 45 59
of 0 45 59
our 1 45 59
bedrock 1 45 59
principle 1 45 59
that 1 45 59
an 1 45 59
accused 1 45 59
has 1 45 59
the 1 45 59
right 1 45 59
to 1 45 59
confront 1 45 59
his 1 45 59
accuser’s 1 45 59
charges. 1 45 59

He 0 45 60
can’t 0 45 60
be 0 45 60
in 0 45 60
the 0 45 60
room 0 45 60
with 0 45 60
her, 0 45 60
apparently 0 45 60
because 0 45 60
she’s 0 45 60
still 0 45 60
traumatized 0 45 60
and 0 45 60
may 0 45 60
start 0 45 60
experiencing 0 45 60
flashbacks. 0 45 60

So 0 45 61
much 0 45 61
for 0 45 61
“I 0 45 61
am 1 45 61
woman, 1 45 61
hear 1 45 61
me 1 45 61
roar.” 1 45 61

Grassley 0 45 62
shouldn’t 0 45 62
cave 0 45 62
on 0 45 62
these 0 45 62
conditions. 0 45 62

They 0 45 63
all 0 45 63
comprise 0 45 63
the 0 45 63
old 0 45 63
tactic 0 45 63
of 0 45 63
serially 0 45 63
escalating 0 45 63
demands 0 45 63
that 0 45 63
cannot 0 45 63
be 0 45 63
satisfied 0 45 63
in 0 45 63
order 0 45 63
to 0 45 63
compel 0 45 63
your 0 45 63
enemy 0 45 63
to 0 45 63
give 0 45 63
in. 0 45 63

That 0 45 64
Grassley 0 45 64
and 0 45 64
the 0 45 64
Republicans 0 45 64
would 0 45 64
even 0 45 64
participate 0 45 64
in 0 45 64
this 0 45 64
absurd 1 45 64
show 1 45 64
trial 1 45 64
is 0 45 64
testimony 0 45 64
to 0 45 64
how 0 45 64
deeply 0 45 64
the 0 45 64
progressive 0 45 64
ideological 0 45 64
narrative 0 45 64
has 0 45 64
burrowed 0 45 64
into 0 45 64
our 0 45 64
social 0 45 64
and 0 45 64
political 0 45 64
life. 0 45 64

If 0 45 65
Ford 0 45 65
actually 0 45 65
testifies 0 45 65
on 0 45 65
Thursday, 0 45 65
or 0 45 65
Ramirez 0 45 65
is 0 45 65
granted 0 45 65
the 0 45 65
same 0 45 65
concession, 0 45 65
nothing 0 45 65
material 0 45 65
will 0 45 65
be 0 45 65
gained. 0 45 65

Her 0 45 66
accusation 0 45 66
will 0 45 66
not 0 45 66
be 0 45 66
proved 0 45 66
true 0 45 66
or 0 45 66
false. 0 45 66

We 0 45 67
will 0 45 67
learn 0 45 67
nothing 0 45 67
about 0 45 67
Kavanaugh 0 45 67
that 0 45 67
makes 0 45 67
him 0 45 67
any 0 45 67
less 0 45 67
eminently 0 45 67
qualified 0 45 67
for 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
Supreme 0 45 67
Court, 0 45 67
nothing 0 45 67
that 0 45 67
can 0 45 67
add 0 45 67
to 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
thousands 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
pages 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
documents 0 45 67
already 0 45 67
presented 0 45 67
to 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
Committee, 0 45 67
or 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
hundreds 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
hours 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
judge’s 0 45 67
testimony 0 45 67
before 0 45 67
rabid 1 45 67
partisans 1 45 67
and 1 45 67
office-seekers. 1 45 67

But 0 45 68
vetting 0 45 68
Kavanaugh’s 0 45 68
qualifications 0 45 68
isn’t 0 45 68
the 0 45 68
point. 0 45 68

The 0 45 69
point 0 45 69
is 0 45 69
to 0 45 69
delay 0 45 69
confirmation 0 45 69
by 0 45 69
slandering 0 45 69
Kavanaugh 0 45 69
and 0 45 69
baiting 0 45 69
the 0 45 69
Republicans 0 45 69
into 0 45 69
appearing 0 45 69
to 0 45 69
abuse 0 45 69
victims 0 45 69
of 0 45 69
sexual 0 45 69
assault. 0 45 69

Why? 0 45 70

Facing 0 45 71
his 0 45 71
likely 0 45 71
confirmation, 0 45 71
the 1 45 71
Dems, 1 45 71
egged 0 45 71
on 0 45 71
by 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
mainstream 0 45 71
media––especially 0 45 71
The 0 45 71
New 0 45 71
Yorker, 0 45 71
which 0 45 71
published 0 45 71
a 0 45 71
story 0 45 71
too 0 45 71
badly 0 45 71
sourced 0 45 71
even 0 45 71
for 0 45 71
The 0 45 71
New 0 45 71
York 0 45 71
Times–– 0 45 71
are 0 45 71
desperately 0 45 71
attempting 0 45 71
to 0 45 71
obstruct 0 45 71
and 0 45 71
delay 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
process 0 45 71
until 0 45 71
after 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
midterm 0 45 71
elections, 0 45 71
when 0 45 71
they 0 45 71
hope 0 45 71
they 0 45 71
will 0 45 71
retake 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
Senate 0 45 71
and 0 45 71
thus 0 45 71
stop 0 45 71
any 0 45 71
more 0 45 71
Constitutionalist 0 45 71
judges 0 45 71
from 0 45 71
being 0 45 71
confirmed 0 45 71
to 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
Court 0 45 71
for 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
rest 0 45 71
of 0 45 71
Trump’s 0 45 71
term. 0 45 71

The 0 45 72
Democrats 0 45 72
have 0 45 72
stooped 1 45 72
so 1 45 72
low 1 45 72
with 1 45 72
these 1 45 72
smears 1 45 72
because 0 45 72
they 0 45 72
know 0 45 72
the 0 45 72
stakes. 0 45 72

The 0 45 73
courts 0 45 73
and 0 45 73
especially 0 45 73
the 0 45 73
Supreme 0 45 73
Court 0 45 73
have 0 45 73
been 0 45 73
critical 0 45 73
to 0 45 73
the 0 45 73
progressives’ 0 45 73
program 0 45 73
since 0 45 73
Woodrow 0 45 73
Wilson. 0 45 73

The 0 45 74
biggest 0 45 74
obstacle 0 45 74
to 0 45 74
the 0 45 74
progressive 0 45 74
dream 0 45 74
of 0 45 74
government 0 45 74
controlled 0 45 74
and 0 45 74
managed 0 45 74
by 0 45 74
a 0 45 74
technocratic 0 45 74
oligarchy 0 45 74
has 0 45 74
been 0 45 74
the 0 45 74
Constitution. 0 45 74

Its 0 45 75
divided 0 45 75
and 0 45 75
balanced 0 45 75
powers 0 45 75
were 0 45 75
designed 0 45 75
precisely 0 45 75
to 0 45 75
rein 0 45 75
in 0 45 75
overreaching 0 45 75
ambition 0 45 75
and 0 45 75
concentrations 0 45 75
of 0 45 75
power. 0 45 75

Hence 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Constitutional 0 45 76
order 0 45 76
must 0 45 76
be 0 45 76
subverted 0 45 76
by 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Supreme 0 45 76
Court 0 45 76
and 0 45 76
its 0 45 76
unaccountable 0 45 76
justices 0 45 76
enjoying 0 45 76
lifelong 0 45 76
tenure. 0 45 76

But 0 45 77
if 0 45 77
Kavanaugh 0 45 77
is 0 45 77
confirmed, 0 45 77
there 0 45 77
will 0 45 77
be 0 45 77
five 0 45 77
reliably 0 45 77
Constitutionalist 0 45 77
justices 0 45 77
on 0 45 77
the 0 45 77
bench, 0 45 77
who 0 45 77
are 0 45 77
unlikely 0 45 77
to 0 45 77
tolerate 0 45 77
judicial 0 45 77
usurpation 0 45 77
of 0 45 77
Congress’s 0 45 77
law-making 0 45 77
powers. 0 45 77

That’s 0 45 78
why 0 45 78
this 0 45 78
current 0 45 78
nomination 0 45 78
is 0 45 78
a 0 45 78
hill 0 45 78
the 1 45 78
Dems 1 45 78
are 0 45 78
willing 0 45 78
to 1 45 78
beclown 1 45 78
themselves 1 45 78
on. 1 45 78

Given 0 45 79
how 0 45 79
obviously 1 45 79
partisan 1 45 79
and 1 45 79
hypocritical 1 45 79
this 0 45 79
ploy 0 45 79
is––doesn’t 0 45 79
Keith 0 45 79
Ellison’s 0 45 79
accuser 0 45 79
deserve 0 45 79
to 0 45 79
be 0 45 79
heard 0 45 79
and 0 45 79
believed 0 45 79
too? 0 45 79

––why 1 45 80
has 1 45 80
Grassley 1 45 80
so 1 45 80
far 1 45 80
allowed 1 45 80
himself 1 45 80
to 1 45 80
be 1 45 80
played 1 45 80
by 1 45 80
the 1 45 80
Dems? 1 45 80

Because 0 45 81
Republicans 0 45 81
fear 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
backlash 0 45 81
from 0 45 81
all 0 45 81
those 0 45 81
women 0 45 81
voters 0 45 81
who 0 45 81
presumably 0 45 81
agree 0 45 81
with 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
fundamentalist 0 45 81
feminists, 0 45 81
and 0 45 81
insist 0 45 81
that 0 45 81
every 1 45 81
accusation 1 45 81
of 1 45 81
sexual 1 45 81
assault, 1 45 81
no 1 45 81
matter 1 45 81
how 1 45 81
much 1 45 81
it’s 1 45 81
unsupported 1 45 81
by 1 45 81
corroborating 1 45 81
evidence 1 45 81
or 1 45 81
even 1 45 81
plausibility, 1 45 81
must 1 45 81
be 1 45 81
believed. 1 45 81

This 0 45 82
contention 0 45 82
itself 0 45 82
is 0 45 82
an 0 45 82
expression 0 45 82
of 0 45 82
the 0 45 82
radical 0 45 82
feminist 0 45 82
narrative 0 45 82
of 0 45 82
innate 0 45 82
male 0 45 82
feral 1 45 82
sexuality 1 45 82
that 0 45 82
makes 0 45 82
them 0 45 82
sexual 1 45 82
predators. 1 45 82

The 0 45 83
irony 0 45 83
is 0 45 83
that 0 45 83
today’s 0 45 83
feminists 0 45 83
have 0 45 83
been 0 45 83
willing 0 45 83
to 0 45 83
sacrifice 0 45 83
the 0 45 83
earlier 0 45 83
narrative 0 45 83
of 0 45 83
female 0 45 83
power 0 45 83
and 0 45 83
agency 0 45 83
that 0 45 83
had 0 45 83
been 0 45 83
stifled 0 45 83
by 0 45 83
traditional 0 45 83
views 0 45 83
of 0 45 83
the 0 45 83
sexes 0 45 83
and 0 45 83
their 0 45 83
capabilities. 0 45 83

Instead, 0 45 84
now 0 45 84
women 0 45 84
are 0 45 84
Victorian 1 45 84
hothouse 1 45 84
flowers 1 45 84
too 0 45 84
delicate 0 45 84
to 0 45 84
make 0 45 84
their 0 45 84
way 0 45 84
through 0 45 84
their 0 45 84
lives 0 45 84
without 0 45 84
the 0 45 84
paternal 0 45 84
federal 0 45 84
government 0 45 84
protecting 0 45 84
them 0 45 84
with 0 45 84
its 0 45 84
coercive 0 45 84
power. 0 45 84

Women 0 45 85
have 0 45 85
exchanged 0 45 85
one 0 45 85
form 0 45 85
of 0 45 85
dependence, 0 45 85
and 0 45 85
one 0 45 85
double 0 45 85
standard 0 45 85
for 0 45 85
another. 0 45 85

The 1 45 86
Dems 1 45 86
are 0 45 86
using 0 45 86
Ford 0 45 86
and 0 45 86
Ramirez 0 45 86
as 0 45 86
part 0 45 86
of 0 45 86
the 0 45 86
Democrats’ 0 45 86
transparently 0 45 86
dishonest 0 45 86
delaying 0 45 86
tactics 0 45 86
because 0 45 86
they 0 45 86
know 0 45 86
that 0 45 86
most 0 45 86
Republicans 0 45 86
have 0 45 86
accepted 0 45 86
this 0 45 86
duplicitous 0 45 86
feminist 0 45 86
narrative 0 45 86
and 0 45 86
fear 0 45 86
challenging 0 45 86
it. 0 45 86

Especially 0 45 87
after 0 45 87
the 0 45 87
recent 0 45 87
spate 0 45 87
of 0 45 87
sexual 0 45 87
assault 0 45 87
charges––many 0 45 87
of 0 45 87
them 0 45 87
true, 0 45 87
some 0 45 87
false, 0 45 87
others 0 45 87
contested–– 0 45 87
politicians 0 45 87
consider 0 45 87
bucking 0 45 87
the 0 45 87
narrative 0 45 87
to 0 45 87
be 0 45 87
as 0 45 87
politically 1 45 87
suicidal 1 45 87
as 0 45 87
proposing 0 45 87
to 0 45 87
reform 0 45 87
Social 0 45 87
Security 0 45 87
and 0 45 87
Medicare. 0 45 87

It’s 0 45 88
the 0 45 88
new 0 45 88
third 0 45 88
rail 0 45 88
of 0 45 88
American 0 45 88
politics, 0 45 88
one 0 45 88
that 0 45 88
transcends 0 45 88
party 0 45 88
affiliation. 0 45 88

Hence 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
widespread 0 45 89
virtue-signaling 0 45 89
on 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
part 0 45 89
even 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
conservative 0 45 89
writers 0 45 89
who 0 45 89
preface 0 45 89
their 0 45 89
comments 0 45 89
about 0 45 89
Ford 0 45 89
and 0 45 89
Ramirez 0 45 89
with 0 45 89
prologues 0 45 89
full 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
truisms 0 45 89
about 0 45 89
how 0 45 89
horrible 0 45 89
sexual 0 45 89
assault 0 45 89
is, 0 45 89
how 0 45 89
its 0 45 89
self-proclaimed 0 45 89
victims 0 45 89
“must 0 45 89
be 0 45 89
heard,” 0 45 89
and 0 45 89
how 0 45 89
churlish 0 45 89
and 0 45 89
sexist 0 45 89
it 0 45 89
is 0 45 89
to 0 45 89
question 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
truth 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
any 0 45 89
charge. 0 45 89

Grown-ups 0 45 90
know 0 45 90
all 0 45 90
that 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
don’t 0 45 90
have 0 45 90
to 0 45 90
be 0 45 90
reminded 0 45 90
every 0 45 90
time 0 45 90
the 0 45 90
subject 0 45 90
arises. 0 45 90

The 1 45 91
Dems 1 45 91
know 0 45 91
that 0 45 91
most 0 45 91
Republicans 0 45 91
come 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
this 0 45 91
conflict 0 45 91
with 0 45 91
the 0 45 91
huge 0 45 91
disadvantage 0 45 91
that 0 45 91
results 0 45 91
from 0 45 91
accepting 0 45 91
your 0 45 91
opponent’s 0 45 91
dubious 1 45 91
ideology 1 45 91
and 1 45 91
dishonest 1 45 91
narrative. 1 45 91

The 0 45 92
progressive 0 45 92
party 0 45 92
can 0 45 92
dare 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
Republicans 0 45 92
to 0 45 92
ignore 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
endless 0 45 92
specious 0 45 92
demands, 0 45 92
stop 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
show-trial, 0 45 92
and 0 45 92
proceed 0 45 92
to 0 45 92
a 0 45 92
vote 0 45 92
on 0 45 92
Kavanaugh, 0 45 92
because 0 45 92
they 0 45 92
know 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
Republicans, 0 45 92
fearful 0 45 92
of 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
“optics,” 0 45 92
will 0 45 92
cave. 0 45 92

They 0 45 93
know 0 45 93
that 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
eleven 0 45 93
male 0 45 93
Republican 0 45 93
Senators 0 45 93
on 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
Judiciary 0 45 93
Committee 0 45 93
dread 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
#MeToo 0 45 93
movement 0 45 93
casting 0 45 93
them 0 45 93
as 0 45 93
knuckle-dragging 1 45 93
Neanderthal 1 45 93
sexists 1 45 93
who 0 45 93
want 0 45 93
to 0 45 93
“silence” 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
accuser 0 45 93
with 0 45 93
their 0 45 93
“cavalier 1 45 93
treatment 1 45 93
of 0 45 93
a 0 45 93
sexual 0 45 93
assault 0 45 93
survivor,” 0 45 93
as 0 45 93
one 0 45 93
Ford 0 45 93
lawyer 0 45 93
has 0 45 93
said. 0 45 93

Republicans 0 45 94
still 0 45 94
don’t 0 45 94
get 0 45 94
that 0 45 94
no 0 45 94
amount 0 45 94
of 0 45 94
appeasement 0 45 94
will 0 45 94
stop 0 45 94
the 0 45 94
left 0 45 94
from 0 45 94
demonizing 1 45 94
them 1 45 94
anyway. 0 45 94

Just 0 45 95
ask 0 45 95
Boy 0 45 95
Scout 0 45 95
Mitt 0 45 95
Romney, 0 45 95
who 1 45 95
was 1 45 95
savaged 1 45 95
for 0 45 95
his 0 45 95
innocuous 0 45 95
“binders 0 45 95
full 0 45 95
of 0 45 95
women.” 0 45 95

And 0 45 96
don’t 0 45 96
forget, 0 45 96
the 0 45 96
old 0 45 96
sorta, 0 45 96
kinda 0 45 96
moderate 0 45 96
Democrats 0 45 96
like 0 45 96
Feinstein 0 45 96
and 0 45 96
Chuck 0 45 96
Schumer, 0 45 96
who 0 45 96
now 0 45 96
have 0 45 96
joined 0 45 96
the 0 45 96
crowd 0 45 96
of 0 45 96
trendoid 1 45 96
socialists 1 45 96
armed 1 45 96
with 1 45 96
torches 1 45 96
and 1 45 96
pitch-forks, 1 45 96
will 0 45 96
go 0 45 96
along 0 45 96
because 0 45 96
they’re 0 45 96
frightened 0 45 96
of 0 45 96
their 0 45 96
party’s 0 45 96
increasingly 1 45 96
rabid 1 45 96
left-wing 1 45 96
base. 1 45 96

What 0 45 97
can 0 45 97
we 0 45 97
do 0 45 97
to 0 45 97
end 0 45 97
these 0 45 97
confirmation 1 45 97
circuses? 1 45 97

Just 0 45 98
stop 0 45 98
holding 0 45 98
them. 0 45 98

There’s 0 45 99
nothing 0 45 99
in 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
Constitution 0 45 99
that 0 45 99
says 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
Senate’s 0 45 99
power 0 45 99
to 0 45 99
give 0 45 99
“advice 0 45 99
and 0 45 99
consent” 0 45 99
to 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
president 0 45 99
regarding 0 45 99
his 0 45 99
nominee 0 45 99
must 0 45 99
entail 0 45 99
days 0 45 99
of 0 45 99
televised 0 45 99
hearings 0 45 99
replete 0 45 99
with 0 45 99
caterwauling 1 45 99
protestors 1 45 99
and 1 45 99
grandstanding 1 45 99
Senators 1 45 99
who’ve 0 45 99
already 0 45 99
made-up 0 45 99
their 0 45 99
minds. 0 45 99

Invite 0 45 100
written 0 45 100
questions 0 45 100
from 0 45 100
the 0 45 100
Senate, 0 45 100
then 0 45 100
schedule 0 45 100
one 0 45 100
day 0 45 100
for 0 45 100
the 0 45 100
nominee 0 45 100
to 0 45 100
respond. 0 45 100

Don’t 0 45 101
put 0 45 101
it 0 45 101
on 0 45 101
television, 0 45 101
but 0 45 101
make 0 45 101
public 0 45 101
a 0 45 101
written 0 45 101
transcript. 0 45 101

Remove 0 45 102
the 0 45 102
television 0 45 102
cameras, 0 45 102
and 0 45 102
attention-craving, 1 45 102
politically 1 45 102
ambitious 1 45 102
Senators 1 45 102
will 0 45 102
be 0 45 102
gone 0 45 102
like 0 45 102
a 0 45 102
cool 0 45 102
breeze. 0 45 102

For 0 45 103
now, 0 45 103
Grassley 0 45 103
needs 0 45 103
to 0 45 103
end 0 45 103
this 0 45 103
farce 1 45 103
if 0 45 103
Ford 0 45 103
doesn’t 0 45 103
show 0 45 103
up 0 45 103
on 0 45 103
Thursday 0 45 103
or 0 45 103
continues 0 45 103
to 0 45 103
negotiate 0 45 103
for 0 45 103
more 0 45 103
delays 0 45 103
and 0 45 103
concessions. 0 45 103

No 0 45 104
more 0 45 104
concessions. 0 45 104

No 0 45 105
more 0 45 105
delays. 0 45 105

No 1 45 106
more 1 45 106
ceding 0 45 106
control 0 45 106
of 0 45 106
the 0 45 106
process 0 45 106
to 0 45 106
Democrat 0 45 106
Party 0 45 106
lawyers. 0 45 106

Don’t 0 45 107
give 0 45 107
Ramirez 0 45 107
the 0 45 107
time 0 45 107
of 0 45 107
day. 0 45 107

Hold 0 45 108
the 0 45 108
vote 0 45 108
no 0 45 108
later 0 45 108
than 0 45 108
Thursday, 0 45 108
or 0 45 108
Friday 0 45 108
if 0 45 108
Ford 0 45 108
does 0 45 108
show 0 45 108
up. 0 45 108

Make 0 45 109
Senators 0 45 109
go 0 45 109
on 0 45 109
the 0 45 109
record 0 45 109
with 0 45 109
their 0 45 109
votes, 0 45 109
and 0 45 109
hold 0 45 109
them 0 45 109
to 0 45 109
account 0 45 109
in 0 45 109
November. 0 45 109

Put 0 45 110
to 0 45 110
the 0 45 110
test 0 45 110
the 1 45 110
Dems’ 1 45 110
claims 0 45 110
that 0 45 110
a 0 45 110
critical 0 45 110
mass 0 45 110
of 0 45 110
women, 0 45 110
many 0 45 110
of 0 45 110
them 0 45 110
with 0 45 110
sons 0 45 110
they 0 45 110
don’t 0 45 110
want 0 45 110
falsely 0 45 110
accused, 0 45 110
believes 0 45 110
the 0 45 110
fundamentalist 0 45 110
feminist 0 45 110
narrative 0 45 110
and 0 45 110
will 0 45 110
vote 0 45 110
accordingly. 0 45 110

To 0 45 111
borrow 0 45 111
Churchill’s 0 45 111
definition 0 45 111
of 0 45 111
appeasement, 0 45 111
stop 1 45 111
feeding 1 45 111
the 1 45 111
alligator 1 45 111
in 1 45 111
the 1 45 111
hopes 1 45 111
that 1 45 111
you 1 45 111
will 1 45 111
be 1 45 111
eaten 1 45 111
last. 1 45 111

For 0 45 112
fifty 0 45 112
years 0 45 112
the 0 45 112
Democrats 0 45 112
have 0 45 112
proven 0 45 112
they 1 45 112
will 1 45 112
demonize 1 45 112
conservatives 0 45 112
as 0 45 112
racist 0 45 112
and 0 45 112
sexist 0 45 112
