Has 0
Trump 0
Opened 1
the 1
Door? 1

Sagacious 1
gun 1
owners 1
have 0
always 0
known 0
that 0
the 0
ultimate 0
goal 0
of 0
gun 1
control 1
extremists 1
such 0
as 0
Chuck 0
Schumer, 0
Nancy 0
Pelosi, 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein, 0
et 0
al., 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
gun 0
confiscation. 0

The 0
plan 0
is 0
not 0
to 0
“control” 0
the 0
private 0
ownership 0
of 0
firearms; 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
PROHIBIT 0
the 0
private 0
ownership 0
of 0
firearms. 0

Enacting 0
ever-encroaching 1
gun 0
control 0
laws 0
is 0
simply 0
an 0
incremental 0
means 0
to 0
the 0
ultimate 0
end 0
of 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
and 0
prohibition. 0

Donald 0
Trump 0
was 0
elected 0
on 0
the 0
promise 0
of 0
protecting 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
(among 0
other 0
things). 0

Instead, 0
he 0
has 0
become 0
the 0
poster 0
boy 0
for 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
egregious 1
gun 1
control 1
machinations 1
of 1
all: 1
gun 1
confiscation. 1

As 0
I 0
reported 0
in 0
this 0
column 0
last 0
week, 0
in 0
a 0
bipartisan 0
meeting 0
with 0
congressmen 0
and 0
senators 0
recently, 0
President 0
Trump 0
“voiced 0
support 0
for 0
confiscating 0
guns 0
from 0
certain 0
individuals 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
dangerous, 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
violates 0
due 0
process 0
rights. 0

“‘I 0
like 0
taking 0
the 0
guns 0
early, 0
like 0
in 0
this 0
crazy 0
man’s 0
case 0
that 0
just 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Florida 0
… 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
court 0
would 0
have 0
taken 0
a 0
long 0
time,’ 0
Trump 0
said 0
at 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
lawmakers 0
on 0
school 0
safety 0
and 0
gun 0
violence. 0

“‘Take 1
the 1
guns 1
first, 1
go 1
through 1
due 1
process 1
second,’ 1
Trump 0
said. 0

“Trump 0
was 0
responding 0
to 0
comments 0
from 0
Vice 0
President 0
Pence 0
that 0
families 0
and 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
should 0
have 0
more 0
tools 0
to 0
report 0
potentially 0
dangerous 0
individuals 0
with 0
weapons. 0

“‘Allow 0
due 0

no 0

are 0
trampled, 1
but 0
the 0
ability 0

go 0
to 0
court, 0

an 0
order 0
and 0
then 0
collect 0
not 0
only 0
the 0
firearms 0
but 0
any 0
weapons,’ 0
Pence 0
said. 0

“‘Or, 0
Mike, 0
take 0
the 0

Well, 0
Trump’s 0
statements 0
are 0
now 0
the 0
rallying 1
cry 1
for 0
gun 0
grabbers 0
all 0
over 0
America 0
to 0
enact 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
laws. 0

So 0
far, 0
five 0
states 0
have 0
passed 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws 0
that 0
allow 0
police 0
agencies 0
to 0
confiscate 0
guns 0
from 0
someone 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
“dangerous” 0
by 0
either 0
a 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officer 0
or 0
a 0
family 0
member 0
BEFORE 0
the 0
individual 0
has 0
committed 0
any 0
crime, 0
and 0
in 0
one 0
State 0
(Rhode 0
Island) 0
the 0
governor 0
issued 0
an 0
executive 0
order 0
implementing 0
a 0
“red 0
flag” 0
law. 0

Here 0
are 0
the 0
six 0
states 0
where 0
the 0
legislatures 0
have 0
already 0
passed—or 0
the 0
governor 0
has 0
already 0
issued 0
an 0
executive 0
order 0
implementing—“red 0
flag” 0
laws: 0

California 0

Connecticut 0

Indiana 0

Oregon 0

Washington 0

Rhode 0
Island 0

And 0
since 0
Trump’s 0
Stalinist 1
statements, 1
there 0
are 0
at 0
least 0
24 0
additional 0
states 0
that 0
are 0
currently 0
considering 0
passing 0
“red 0

laws. 0

These 0
are: 0

Alabama 0

North 0

Ohio 0

And 0
it’s 0
not 0
taking 0
long 0
for 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agencies 0
in 0
the 0
above 0
states 0
to 0
begin 0
their 0
Naziesque 0
assault 0
on 0
gun 0
owners. 0

This 0
report 0
is 0
from 0
Seattle:Doubtless, 0
many 0
other 0
states 0
are 0
also 0
considering 0
passing 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws. 0

“The 0
city’s 0

the 0
first 0

in 0
the 0

to 0
force 0
the 0
surrender 0
of 0
a 0
firearm 0

a 0
new 0

known 0
as 0
an 0
‘extreme 0

“The 0

The 0
volume 0
of 0

convinced 0

to 0
seek 0
an 0
extreme 0
risk 0
protection 0

“The 0

only 0
last 0
a 0
year, 0
although 0
they 0
can 0
be 0
renewed.” 0

See 0
the 0
report 0
here: 0

Seattle 0
Police 0
First 0
In 0
State 0
To 0
Seize 0
Gun 0
Under 0
Mental 0
Health 0
Law 0

A 0
few 0
observations 0
are 0
in 0
order 0
here: 0

First, 1
the 1
open 1
carry 1
of 1
a 1
firearm 1
is 1
LEGAL 1
in 1
the 1
area 1
where 1
this 1
took 1
place. 1

So, 1
the 1
fellow 1
was 1
violating 1
NO 1
gun 1
laws 1
whatsoever. 1

Plus, 0
he 0
never 0
removed 0
the 0
pistol 0
from 0
its 0
holster 0
or 0
brandished 0
it 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

Secondly, 0
the 0
man 0
was 0
“known” 0
to 0
nearby 0
bars 0
and 0
restaurants 0
near 0
his 0
place 0
of 0
residence. 0

That 0
means 0
nothing. 0

Known 0
for 0
what? 0

The 0
report 0
doesn’t 0
even 0
say 0
the 0
man 0
was 0
known 0
for 0
acting 0
weirdly 0
or 0
strangely. 0

It 0
just 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
“known.” 0
And 0
even 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
act 0
weirdly 0
or 0
strangely, 0
if 0
we 0
denied 0
constitutional 0
rights 0
to 0
everyone 0
in 0
that 0
category, 0
a 0
majority 0
of 0
Americans 0
would 0
have 0
no 0
rights, 0
and 1
ALL 1
of 1
Congress 1
would 1
have 1
no 1
rights. 1

Thirdly, 1
what 1
does 1
“volume 1
of 1
complaints” 1
mean? 1

How 1
many 1
complaints 1
were 1
received 1
over 1
a 1
YEAR’S 1
time? 1

Two? 1

Five? 1

Ten? 1

People 1
complaining 1
about 1
other 1
people 1
happens 1
all 1
of 1
the 1
time. 1

Plus, 0
if 0
complaints 0
had 0
been 0
received 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
an 0
entire 0
year 0
and 0
police 0
just 0
now 0
decided 0
to 0
act, 0
the 0
man 0
must 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
considered 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
threat. 0

Fourthly, 0
there 0
was 0
NO 1
report 0
of 0
the 0
man 0
“exhibiting 0
violent 0
behavior,” 0
as 0
the 0
police 0
sergeant 0
claims. 0

The 0
report 0
says 0
“he 0
had 0
been 0
intimidating 0
people.” 0
How? 0

No 0
specifics 0
except 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
was 0
“staring” 0
at 0
people. 0

Wow! 1

Run 1
for 1
your 1
lives! 1

Fifthly, 1
a 1
U.S. 1
citizen 1
who 1
has 1
committed 1
NO 1
CRIME 1
is 1
denied 1
his 1
Natural 1
right 1
of 1
self-defense 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
year. 1

And 1
the 1
media 1
report 1
says 1
the 1
confiscations 1
“only” 1
last 1
a 1
year, 1
with 1
the 1
caveat 1
that 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
extended. 1

Indeed. 1

They 1
could 1
and 1
very 1
likely 1
will 1
be 1
extended 1
indefinitely. 1

How 1
many 1
defenseless 1
(unarmed) 1
people 1
are 1
robbed, 1
assaulted, 1
accosted, 1
beaten 1
up, 1
raped, 1
wounded, 1
paralyzed, 1
or 1
killed 1
in 1
a 1
year’s 1
time? 1

It 0
seems 0
many 0
politicians 0
(and 0
many 0
police 0
officers 0
themselves) 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
content 0
until 0
every 0
American 0
citizen 0
is 0
totally 0
defenseless 0
and 0
unable 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
or 0
herself. 0

I 0
tell 0
you 0
this 0
with 0
all 0
seriousness: 0
At 1
some 1
point, 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
will 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
view 1
these 1
governmental 1
attacks 1
against 1
our 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
liberties 1
as 1
a 1
declaration 1
of 1
war. 1

Sixthly, 0
the 0
man 0
quoted 0
in 0
the 0
news 0
story 0
who 0
had 0
complained 0
about 0
the 0
armed 0
fellow 0
did 0
so 0
because 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
sight 0
of 0
the 0
man 0
carrying 0
a 0
firearm, 0
as 0
it 0
made 0
him 0
“afraid.” 0

SO 1
WHAT? 1

That 0
the 0
mere 0
sight 0
of 0
a 0
law-abiding 0
citizen 0
openly 0
carrying 0
a 0
sidearm 0
would 0
make 0
someone 0
“afraid” 0
is 0
not 0
sufficient 0
reason 0
to 0
deny 0
the 0
citizen 0
his 0
constitutional 0
right 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
“bear” 0
arms. 0

This 1
“I’m 1
offended” 1
or 1
“his 1
gun 1
scares 1
me” 1
complaint 1
is 1
nothing 1
but 1
cover 1
for 1
little 1
Nazis 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
deny 1
another 1
person 1
their 1
Natural, 1
God-given 1
liberty. 1

But 0
under 0
this 0
new 0
“red 0
flag” 0
law 0
in 0
Washington 0
State, 0
police 0
are 0
now 0
able 0
to 0
confiscate 0
a 0
person’s 0
firearm 0
without 0
the 0
person 0
committing 0
ANY 1
crime—or 0
even 0
threatening 0
to 0
commit 0
a 0
crime. 0

Even 0
when 0
police 0
forced 0
the 0
man 0
to 0
surrender 0
his 0
firearm, 0
the 0
man 0
made 0
no 0
threatening 0
gesture 0
toward 0
the 0
officers. 0

Gun 0
confiscation 0
has 0
started 0
in 0
America—and 0
President 1
Trump’s 1
Stalinist 1
statements 1
about 1
taking 1
guns 1
first 1
and 1
worrying 1
about 1
due 1
process 1
later 1
is 1
the 1
banner 1
under 1
which 1
this 1
is 1
happening. 1

When 0
Trump 0
promised 0
to 0
add 0
“mental 0
health” 0
regulations 0
to 0
gun 0
purchases 0
and 0
ownership, 0
he 1
opened 1
Pandora’s 1
Box. 1

I 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
“mental 0
health” 0
trap 0
in 0
more 0
detail 0
in 0
this 0
column: 0

Trump 0
Set 0
To 0
Enact 0
More 0
Gun 0
Control 0

“Mental 0
health” 0
regulations 0
for 0
gun 0
ownership 0
is 0
what 0
extremist 0
gun 0
grabbers 0
Schumer, 0
Pelosi, 0
Feinstein, 0
et 0
al., 0
have 0
been 0
trying 0
to 0
accomplish 0
for 0
decades. 0

Now, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
“pro-gun” 0
Republican 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
who 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
making 0
it 0
happen. 0

Kris 0
Kobach 0
is 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
of 0
Kansas. 0

He 0
is 0
a 0
former 0
professor 0
of 0
constitutional 0
law 0
at 0
UMKC 0
Law 0
School. 0

He 0
wrote 0
an 0
excellent 0
analysis 0
of 0
the 0
constitutional 0
violations 0
of 0
these 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws: 0

The 0
seizure 0
of 0
guns 0
without 0
any 0
hearing 0
at 0
all. 0

The 0
laws 0
all 0
contain 0
an 0
“ex 0
parte” 0
provision 0
that 0
allows 0
the 0
state 0
to 0
temporarily 0
seize 0
a 0
person’s 0
guns 0
without 0
even 0
notifying 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
or 0
giving 0
him 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
be 0
heard. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
quintessential 0
denial 0
of 0
due 0
process. 0

The 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
makes 0
clear 0
that 0
a 0
person 0
cannot 0
be 0
denied 0
of 0
liberty 0
(to 0
exercise 0
one’s 0
constitutional 0
right 0
to 0
bear 0
arms) 0
without 0
due 0
process 0
of 0
law. 0

This 0
confiscation 0
is 0
“temporary,” 0
but 0
it 0
can 0
easily 0
lead 0
to 0
long-term 0
or 0
permanent 0
confiscation. 0

Based 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
one 0
unrelated 0
person. 0

The 0
confiscation 0
order 0
can 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
only 0
one 0
person 0
claiming 0
that 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
poses 0
a 0
risk 0
to 0
the 0
safety 0
of 0
himself 0
or 0
others. 0

The 0
law 0
deceptively 1
says 1
that 0
it 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
a 0
“family 0
member.” 0
[Most 0
of 0
the 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
Washington 0
State, 0
do 0
not 0
limit 0
who 0
can 0
claim 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
poses 0
a 0
risk 0
to 0
the 0
safety 0
of 0
himself 0
or 0
others 0
to 0
family 0
members.] 0

But 0
“family 0
member” 0
is 0
defined 0
to 0
include 0
“former 0
dating 0
partners” 0
and 0
anyone 0
who 0
has 0
ever 0
lived 0
with 0
the 0
defendant. 0

So 0
a 0
jilted 0
former 0
boyfriend 0
or 0
girlfriend, 0
or 0
even 0
a 0
roommate 0
from 0
years 0
ago, 0
could 0
easily 0
set 0
in 0
motion 0
the 0
disarming 0
of 0
a 0
lawful 0
gun 0
owner. 0

Using 0
a 0
very 0
low 0
standard 0
of 0
proof. 0

The 0
standard 0
for 0
obtaining 0
an 0
ex 0
parte 0
order 0
against 0
a 0
gun 0
owner 0
is 0
absurdly 1
low 1
– 0
one 0
need 0
only 0
show 0
“reasonable 0
cause” 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
person 0
may 0
pose 0
a 0
risk. 0

That’s 0
even 0
lower 0
than 0
the 0
“probable 0
cause” 0
standard 0
for 0
obtaining 0
a 0
search 0
warrant. 0

In 0
addition, 0
the 0
judge 0
is 0
forced 0
to 0
rush 0
his 0
decision 0
and 0
issue 0
the 0
confiscation 0
order 0
on 0
the 0
same 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
ex 0
parte 0
hearing. 0

Within 0
two 0
weeks 0
of 0
the 0
ex 0
parte 0
hearing, 0
a 0
hearing 0
with 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
present 0
must 0
occur; 0
the 0
purpose 0
is 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
a 0
long-term 0
confiscation 0
order. 0

But 0
even 0
at 0
that 0
hearing, 0
the 0
standard 0
of 0
proof 0
is 0
far 0
below 0
the 0
“beyond 0
a 0
reasonable 0
doubt” 0
standard 0
used 0
in 0
criminal 0
trials. 0

Rather, 0
it 0
need 0
only 0
be 0
shown 0
by 0
“a 0
preponderance 0
of 0
evidence” 0
that 0
the 0
person 0
poses 0
a 0
risk 0
of 0
injury 0
to 0
self 0
or 0
others. 0

What 0
kind 0
of 0
evidence? 0

Things 0
like 0
the 0
“reckless 0
storage” 0
of 0
firearms 0
and 0
drinking 0
habits 0
can 0
be 0
considered. 0

If 1
you 1
keep 1
a 1
handgun 1
in 1
the 1
bedside 1
table 1
and 1
drink 1
beer 1
regularly, 1
you 1
may 1
[be] 1
in 1
trouble. 1

Shifting 0
the 0
burden 0
of 0
proof 0
to 0
the 0
gun 0
owner. 0

The 0
long-term 0
confiscation 0
order 0
lasts 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
year, 0
but 0
may 0
be 0
renewed 0
indefinitely. 0

Once 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
place, 0
it 0
becomes 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
remove. 0

To 0
have 0
the 0
confiscation 0
order 0
lifted, 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
must 0
provehe 0
does 0
not 0
pose 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
himself 0
or 0
others. 0

Proving 1
a 1
negative 1
is 1
nearly 1
impossible. 1

Adding 1
insult 1
to 1
injury, 1
the 0
bill 0
even 0
authorizes 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
to 0
charge 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
a 0
storage 0
fee 0
for 0
confiscating 0
and 0
storing 0
his 0
guns. 0

After 0
the 0
Parkland 0
school 0
shooting, 0
had 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
simply 0
used 0
his 0
bully 1
pulpit 1
to 0
promote 0
arming 0
teachers 0
and 0
school 0
employees 0
as 0
a 0
deterrent 0
and 0
defense 0
against 0
these 0
school 0
shootings 0
without 0
calling 0
for 0
more 0
gun 0
control, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
HUGE 1
boost 0
for 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
in 0
general 0
and 0
school 0
safety 0
in 0
particular. 0

Instead, 0
Trump 0
fell 0
in 0
with 0
anti-Second 0
Amendment 0
liberals 0
and 0
started 0
calling 0
for 0
more 0
gun 0
control, 0
adding 0
“mental 0
health” 0
restrictions 0
to 0
gun 0
purchases 0
and 0
making 1
his 1
stupid 1
Stalinist 1
statements 1
about 1
taking 1
guns 1
first 1
and 1
worrying 1
about 1
due 1
process 1
later. 1

As 0
a 0
result, 0
anti-gun 0
liberals 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
country 0
are 0
using 0
Trump’s 0
own 0
words 0
and 0
proposed 0
gun 0
control 0
policies 0
as 0
a 0
rallying 1
cry 1
to 0
enact 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
laws. 0

As 0
it 0
stands 0
right 0
now, 0
Donald 1
Trump 1
has 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
more 1
damage 1
being 1
done 1
to 1
the 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
president, 1
Democrat 1
or 1
Republican, 1
in 1
our 1
lifetime. 1

Freedomists 0
in 0
the 0
50 0
states 0
had 0
better 0
keep 0
a 0
close 0
eye 0
on 0
their 0
State 0
legislatures 0
this 0
year 0
and 0
next, 0
because, 0
thanks 0
to 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
agenda 0
in 0
virtually 0
every 0
single 0
State 0
in 0
the 0
country. 0

And 0
while 0
you 0
are 0
at 0
it, 0
don’t 0
overlook 0
the 0
federal 0
Congress. 0

No 0
wonder 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
looked 0
so 1
deliriously 1
(and 1
devilishly) 1
happy 0
when 0
Trump 0
uttered 1
his 1
stupid 1
comment 1
about 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
bring 0
an 0
assault 0
weapons 0
ban 0
(Feinstein’s 0
bill) 0
into 0
proposed 0
gun 0
control 0
legislation. 0

See 0

Erupt 1
With 1
Glee 1
After 0
Trump 0
Seems 0
To 0
Endorse 0
Her 0
Assault 0
Weapons 0
Ban 0

But 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
freedom-loving 1
American 1
who 0
values 0
your 0
liberties 0
and 0
the 0
God-given 0
right 0
to 0
defend 0
them, 0
happy 0
is 0
NOT 1
what 0
you 0
should 0
be 0
feeling 0
right 0
now. 0

You 0
should 0
be 0
OUTRAGED 0
at 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
and 0
you 0
should 0
be 0
absolutely 0
determined 0
to 0
be 0
ever 0
vigilant 0
against 0
ANY 1
attempt 0
from 0
Democrats 0
or 0
Republicans 0
from 0
federal, 0
State, 0
or 0
municipal 0
government 0
to 0
enact 0
further 0
restrictions 0
against 0
your 0
right 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
bear 0
arms—because 0
Trump 0
has 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
not 0
only 0
for 0
more 0
gun 0
control 0
but 0
also 0
for 0
gun 0
confiscation. 0

P.S. 0

One 0
more 0
time 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
remind 0
readers 0
that 0
self-defense—including 0
defense 0
against 0
tyrannical 0
government—is 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
right 0
guaranteed 0
in 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
to 0
our 0
Constitution; 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
duty 0
assigned 0
us 0
in 0
Nature 0
by 0
our 0
Creator. 0

For 0
anyone, 0
especially 0
a 0
Christian, 0
to 0
willingly 0
surrender 0
their 0
means 0
of 0
self-defense 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
a 0
crime 0
against 0
liberty; 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
sin 0
against 0
God. 0

I 0
urge 0
my 0
Christian 0
friends 0
(and 0
anyone 0
else) 0
to 0
read 0
the 0
book 0
my 0
constitutional 0
attorney 0
son 0
and 0
I 0
wrote 0
entitled 0
“To 0
Keep 0
or 0
Not 0
To 0
Keep: 0
Why 0
Christians 0
Should 0
Not 0
Give 0
Up 0
Their 0
Guns.” 0

Mark 0
it 0
down: 0
Any 0
law 0
demanding 0
the 0
citizenry 0
to 0
surrender 0
their 0
AR-15 0
rifles 0
would 0
be 0
unconstitutional, 0
unnatural, 0
and 0
unbiblical. 0

And 0
NO 1
Christian 0
or 0
other 0
free 0
man 0
should 0
ever 0
comply 0
with 0
such 0
a 0
law. 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
plethora 0
of 0
pastors 0
who 0
teach 0
that 0
Christians 0
ought 0
to 0
obey 0
the 0
government 0
should 0
it 0
outlaw 0
our 0
guns. 0

THEY 0
ARE 0
WRONG. 0

They 1
are 1
wrong 1
biblically, 1
constitutionally, 0
and 0
morally. 0

Our 0
book 0
shows 0
the 0
Natural 0
and 0
Biblical 0
duty 0
of 0
self-defense. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
of 0
another 0
book 0
like 0
it. 0

With 0
all 0
that 0
is 0
happening 0
today, 0
it 0
is 0
CRUCIAL 1
that 0
people 0
(especially 0
Christians) 0
become 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
truths 0
contained 0
in 0
this 0
book. 0

I 0
urge 0
you 0
to 0
order 0
one 0
for 0
yourself 0
and 0
one 0
(at 0
least) 0
for 0
your 0
friends 0
and 0
kinfolk. 0
