Vatican 0
Theologian 0
Sacked 0
for 0
Questioning 0
“Merciful” 0
Pope’s 0
Pontificate 0

By 0
now 0
the 0
whole 0
Catholic 0
world 0
has 0
heard 0
of 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
a 1
devastating 1
letter 1
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
from 0
Father 0
Thomas 0
G. 0
Weinandy. 0

The 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
theological 0
secretariat 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Bishop’s 0
conference, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
has 0
taught 0
at 0
both 0
Oxford 0
and 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Gregorian 0
University 0
in 0
Rome. 0

None 0
other 0
than 0
Francis 0
appointed 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
to 0
the 0
International 0
Theological 0
Commission 0
and 0
awarded 0
him 0
the 0
Pro 0
Pontifice 0
et 0
Ecclesiae 0
medal, 0
the 0
ecclesial 0
equivalent 0
of 0
the 0
Congressional 0
Medal 0
of 0
Honor, 0
for 0
his 0
work 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
the 0
Pope 0
and 0
the 0
Church. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 0
renowned 0
theologians, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
is 0
a 0
“man 0
of 0
the 0
Council” 0
and 0
a 0
prominent 0
figure 0
of 0
the 0
post-conciliar 0
mainstream. 0

Yet 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
letter, 0
sent 0
to 0
Francis 0
privately 0
last 0
summer 0
but 0
predictably 0
ignored 0
by 0
him—along 0
with 0
every 0
other 0
private 0
entreaty 0
concerning 0
his 0
destructive 0
activity—is 0
a 1
withering 1
indictment 1
of 1
a 1
papacy 1
that 1
constitutes 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
menace 1
to 1
the 1
Church. 1

The 0
key 0
passages 0
(paragraph 0
breaks 0
added) 0
rebuke 0
Francis 0
for 0
his 0
recklessness, 0
his 0
deliberate 0
ambiguity, 0
his 0
fomenting 0
of 0
error, 0
his 0
sowing 0
of 0
disunity, 0
his 0
unheard-of 0
calumnies 0
of 0
the 0
faithful, 0
and 0
even 0
his 0
reduction 0
of 0
the 0
faith 0
to 0
an 0
ideology—precisely 0
the 0
wrong 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
accuses 0
orthodox 0
Catholics: 0

Your 0

Holiness, 0

a 1
chronic 1
confusion 1
seems 1
to 1
mark 1
your 1
pontificate…. 1

This 0
fosters 0
within 0
the 0
faithful 0
a 0
growing 0
unease 0
…. 0

In 0
"Amoris 0
Laetitia," 0
your 0
guidance 0
at 0
times 0
seems 0
intentionally 0
ambiguous, 0
thus 0
inviting 0
both 0
a 0
traditional 0
interpretation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
on 0
marriage 0
and 0
divorce 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
one 0
that 0
might 0
imply 0
a 0
change 0
in 0
that 0
teaching…. 0

To 1
teach 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
seemingly 1
intentional 1
lack 1
of 1
clarity 1
inevitably 1
risks 1
sinning 1
against 1
the 1
Holy 1
Spirit, 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
truth. 1

The 0
Holy 0
Spirit 0
is 0
given 0
to 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
particularly 0
to 0
yourself, 0
to 0
dispel 0
error, 0
not 0
to 0
foster 0
it. 0

[Y]ou 0
seem 0
to 0
censor 0
and 0
even 0
mock 0
those 0
who 0
interpret 0
Chapter 0
8 0
of 0
"Amoris 0
Laetitia" 0
in 0
accord 0
with 0
Church 0
tradition 0
as 0
Pharisaic 1
stone-throwers 1
who 1
embody 1
a 1
merciless 1
rigorism. 1

This 0
kind 0
of 0
calumny 0
is 0
alien 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
Petrine 0
ministry…. 0

Such 0
behavior 0
gives 0
the 0
impression 0
that 0
your 0
views 0
cannotsurvive 0
theological 0
scrutiny, 0
and 0
so 0
must 0
be 0
sustained 0
by 0
“ad 0
hominem” 0
arguments. 0

[T]oo 0
often 0
your 0
manner 0
seems 0
to 0
demean 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
Church 0
doctrine. 0

Again 0
and 0
again 0
you 0
portray 0
doctrine 0
as 0
dead 0
and 0
bookish, 0
and 0
far 0
from 0
the 0
pastoral 0
concerns 0
of 0
everyday 0
life. 0

Your 0
critics 0
have 0
been 0
accused, 0
in 0
your 0
own 0
words, 0
of 0
making 0
doctrine 0
an 0
ideology. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
precisely 0
Christian 0
doctrine… 0
that 0
frees 0
people 0
from 0
worldly 0
ideologies 0
and 0
assures 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
actually 0
preaching 0
and 0
teaching 0
the 0
authentic, 0
life-giving 0
Gospel. 0

Those 0
who 0
devalue 0
the 0
doctrines 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
[i.e., 0
Francis!] 0

separate 0
themselves 0
from 0
Jesus, 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
truth… 0
What 0
they 0
[i.e., 0
Francis] 0
then 0
possess, 0
and 0
can 0
only 0
possess, 0
is 0
an 0
ideology 0
– 0
one 0
that 0
conforms 0
to 0
the 0
world 0
of 0
sin 0
and 0
death. 0

[F]aithful 0
Catholics 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
disconcerted 0
by 0
your 0
choice 0
of 0
some 0
bishops, 0
men 0
who 0
seem 0
not 0
merely 0
open 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
views 0
counter 0
to 0
Christian 0
belief 0
but 0
who 0
support 0
and 0
even 0
defend 0
them. 0

What 0
scandalizes 0
believers, 0
and 0
even 0
some 0
fellow 0
bishops, 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
your 0
having 0
appointed 0
such 0
men 0
to 0
be 0
shepherds 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
but 0
that 0
you 0
also 0
seem 0
silent 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
their 0
teaching 0
and 0
pastoral 0
practice…. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
faithful, 0
who 0
embody 0
the 0
"sensus 0
fidelium," 0
are 0
losing 0
confidence 0
in 0
their 0
supreme 0
shepherd. 0

[T]he 0
Church 0
is 0
one 0
body, 0
the 0
Mystical 0
Body 0
of 0
Christ, 0
and 0
you 0
are 0
commissioned 0
by 0
the 0
Lord 0
himself 0
to 0
promote 0
and 0
strengthen 0
her 0
unity. 0

But 0
your 0
actions 0
and 0
words 0
too 0
often 0
seem 0
intent 0
on 0
doing 0
the 0
opposite…. 0

You 0
have 0
often 0
spoken 0
about 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
transparency 0
within 0
the 0
Church. 0

You 0
have 0
frequently 0
encouraged… 0
all 0
persons, 0
especially 0
bishops, 0
to 0
speak 0
their 0
mind 0
and 0
not 0
be 0
fearful 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
pope 0
may 0
think. 0

But… 0
what 0
many 0
[bishops] 0
have 0
learned 0
from 0
your 0
pontificate 0
is 0
not 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
open 0
to 0
criticism, 0
but 0
that 0
you 0
resent 0
it… 0
Many 0
fear 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
speak 0
their 0
mind, 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
marginalized 0
or 0
worse. 0

I 0
have 0
often 0
asked 0
myself: 0
"Why 0
has 0
Jesus 0
let 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
happen?" 0

The 1
only 1
answer 1
that 1
comes 1
to 1
mind 1
is 1
that 1
Jesus 1
wants 1
to 1
manifest 1
just 1
how 1
weak 1
is 1
the 1
faith 1
of 1
many 1
within 1
the 1
Church, 1
even 1
among 1
too 1
many 1
of 1
her 1
bishops. 1

Ironically, 1
your 1
pontificate 1
has 1
given 1
those 1
who 1
hold 1
harmful 1
theological 1
and 1
pastoral 1
views 1
the 1
license 1
and 1
confidence 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
expose 1
their 1
previously 1
hidden 1
darkness…. 1

Father 0
Weinandy 0
reveals 0
that 0
he 0
decided 0
to 0
publicize 0
this 0
historic 0
missive 0
only 0
after 0
receiving 0
an 0
unmistakable 0
sign 0
from 0
heaven. 0

As 0
he 0
recounts 0
here, 0
after 0
repeatedly 0
“beseeching 0
Jesus 0
and 0
Mary, 0
St. 0
Peter 0
and 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
saintly 0
popes 0
who 0
are 0
buried 0
there 0
to 0
do 0
something 0
to 0
rectify 0
the 0
confusion 0
and 0
turmoil 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
today, 0
a 0
chaos 0
and 0
an 0
uncertainty 0
that 0
I 0
felt 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
had 0
himself 0
caused,” 0
he 0
asked 0
for 0
a 0
minutely 0
specific 0
sign 0
from 0
heaven 0
on 0
whether 0
he 0
should 0
write 0
the 0
letter: 0
that 0
the 0
next 0
day 0
he 0
would 0
meet 0
someone 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
seen 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time, 0
would 0
never 0
expect 0
to 0
see 0
in 0
Rome, 0
and 0
was 0
not 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Canada 0
or 0
Great 0
Britain, 0
which 0
person 0
would 0
utter 0
the 0
particular 0
phrase: 0
“Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing.” 0

At 0

lunch 0
the 0
next 0
day, 0
the 0
sign 0
was 0
given. 0

An 0
old 0
friend 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
seen 0
in 0
more 0
than 0
twenty 0
years 0
and 0
would 0
never 0
have 0
expected 0
to 0
meet 0
in 0
Rome, 0
who 0
is 0
now 0
an 0
archbishop, 0
appeared 0
suddenly 0
from 0
between 0
two 0
parked 0
cars, 0
renewed 0
acquaintances 0
and, 0
referring 0
to 0
one 0
of 0
Father 0
Weinandy’s 0
books, 0
said: 0
“Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing.” 0

Writes 0

Fr. 0

Weinandy: 0
“I 0
could 0
hardly 0
believe 0
that 0
this 0
just 0
happened 0
in 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
a 0
few 0
minutes. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
longer 0
any 0
doubt 0
in 0
my 0
mind 0
that 0
Jesus 0
wanted 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
something. 0

I 0
also 0
think 0
it 0
significant 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
Archbishop 0
that 0
Jesus 0
used. 0

I 0
considered 0
it 0
an 0
apostolic 0
mandate.” 0

Can 0

we 0
doubt 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
indeed 0
an 0
apostolic 0
mandate? 0

Can 0
we 0
not 0
see 0
in 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
a 0
voice 0
raised 0
up 0
by 0
heaven 0
itself 0
to 0
say, 0
from 1
deep 1
within 1
the 1
post-conciliar 1
ecclesial 1
establishment, 1
things 1
that 1
exceed 1
in 1
their 1
candor 1
what 0
even 0
certain 0
traditionalist 0
commentators 0
have 0
ventured 0
to 0
state? 0

As 0
if 0
to 0
confirm 0
the 0
validity 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
indictment 0
of 0
this 0
pontificate, 0
only 0
a 0
day 0
after 0
this 0
letter 0
was 0
published, 0
the 0
USCCB 0
demanded 0
that 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
resign 0
his 0
current 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
consultant 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
bishops. 0

He 0
has 0
done 0
so. 0

Fr. 0

Fessio’s 0
Catholic 0
World 0
Report, 0
another 0
voice 0
of 0
the 0
rising 0
mainstream 0
opposition 0
to 0
Francis, 0
notes 0
that 0
“In 0
making 0
such 0
a 0
request, 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
it 0
would 0
appear, 0
reinforces 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
very 0
point 0
about 0
fearfulness 0
and 0
lack 0
of 0
transparency.” 0

Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0

intervention 0
gives 0
us 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
remake 0
the 0
Church 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
mind 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
will 0
ultimately 0
encounter 0
a 0
resistance 0
that 0
will 0
bring 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
Latin 0
American-style 0
dictatorship 0
Francis 0
has 0
imposed 0
upon 0
the 0
Church, 0
even 0
as 0
he 0
speaks 0
of 0
dialogue, 0
collegiality, 0
decentralization 0
and 0
parreshia 0
(but 0
only 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
agree 0
with 0
him). 0

The 0
plan 0
that 0
ultimately 0
must 0
fail 0
may 0
well 0
fail 0
even 0
while 0
Francis 0
is 0
attempting 0
