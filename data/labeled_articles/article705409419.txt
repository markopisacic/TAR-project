entreaty 0 258 9

a 1 258 9
withering 1 258 9

which 0 258 10

Your 0 258 11
Holiness, 0 258 11
a 1 258 11
chronic 1 258 11
confusion 1 258 11
seems 1 258 11
to 1 258 11
mark 1 258 11
your 1 258 11
pontificate…. 1 258 11

This 0 258 12
fosters 0 258 12
within 0 258 12
the 0 258 12
faithful 0 258 12
a 0 258 12
growing 0 258 12
unease 0 258 12
…. 0 258 12

In 0 258 13
"Amoris 0 258 13

your 0 258 13
guidance 0 258 13
at 0 258 13
times 0 258 13
seems 0 258 13
intentionally 0 258 13
ambiguous, 0 258 13
thus 0 258 13
inviting 0 258 13
both 0 258 13
a 0 258 13
traditional 0 258 13
interpretation 0 258 13
of 0 258 13
Catholic 0 258 13
teaching 0 258 13
on 0 258 13
marriage 0 258 13

as 0 258 13
well 0 258 13
as 0 258 13
one 0 258 13
that 0 258 13
might 0 258 13
imply 0 258 13
a 0 258 13
change 0 258 13
in 0 258 13
that 0 258 13
teaching…. 0 258 13

To 1 258 14
teach 1 258 14
with 1 258 14
such 1 258 14
a 1 258 14
seemingly 1 258 14
intentional 1 258 14
lack 1 258 14
of 1 258 14
clarity 1 258 14
inevitably 1 258 14
risks 1 258 14
sinning 1 258 14
against 1 258 14
the 1 258 14
Holy 1 258 14
Spirit, 1 258 14
the 1 258 14
Spirit 1 258 14
of 1 258 14
truth. 1 258 14

The 0 258 15
Holy 0 258 15
Spirit 0 258 15
is 0 258 15
given 0 258 15
to 0 258 15
the 0 258 15
Church, 0 258 15
and 0 258 15
particularly 0 258 15
to 0 258 15
yourself, 0 258 15
to 0 258 15
dispel 0 258 15
error, 0 258 15
not 0 258 15
to 0 258 15
foster 0 258 15
it. 0 258 15

[Y]ou 0 258 16
seem 0 258 16
to 0 258 16
censor 0 258 16
and 0 258 16
even 0 258 16
mock 0 258 16
those 0 258 16
who 0 258 16
interpret 0 258 16
Chapter 0 258 16
8 0 258 16
of 0 258 16
"Amoris 0 258 16
Laetitia" 0 258 16
in 0 258 16
accord 0 258 16
with 0 258 16
Church 0 258 16
tradition 0 258 16
as 0 258 16
Pharisaic 1 258 16
stone-throwers 1 258 16
who 1 258 16
embody 1 258 16
a 1 258 16
merciless 1 258 16
rigorism. 1 258 16

This 0 258 17
kind 0 258 17
of 0 258 17
calumny 0 258 17
is 0 258 17
alien 0 258 17
to 0 258 17
the 0 258 17
nature 0 258 17
of 0 258 17
the 0 258 17
Petrine 0 258 17
ministry…. 0 258 17

Such 0 258 18
behavior 0 258 18
gives 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
impression 0 258 18
that 0 258 18
your 0 258 18
views 0 258 18
cannotsurvive 0 258 18
theological 0 258 18
scrutiny, 0 258 18
and 0 258 18
so 0 258 18
must 0 258 18
be 0 258 18
sustained 0 258 18
by 0 258 18
“ad 0 258 18
hominem” 0 258 18
arguments. 0 258 18

[T]oo 0 258 19
often 0 258 19
your 0 258 19
manner 0 258 19
seems 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
demean 0 258 19
the 0 258 19
importance 0 258 19
of 0 258 19
Church 0 258 19
doctrine. 0 258 19

Again 0 258 20
and 0 258 20
again 0 258 20
you 0 258 20
portray 0 258 20
doctrine 0 258 20
as 0 258 20
dead 0 258 20
and 0 258 20
bookish, 0 258 20
and 0 258 20
far 0 258 20
from 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
pastoral 0 258 20
concerns 0 258 20
of 0 258 20
everyday 0 258 20
life. 0 258 20

Your 0 258 21
critics 0 258 21
have 0 258 21
been 0 258 21
accused, 0 258 21
in 0 258 21
your 0 258 21
own 0 258 21
words, 0 258 21
of 0 258 21
making 0 258 21
doctrine 0 258 21
an 0 258 21
ideology. 0 258 21

But 0 258 22
it 0 258 22
is 0 258 22
precisely 0 258 22
Christian 0 258 22
doctrine… 0 258 22
that 0 258 22
frees 0 258 22
people 0 258 22
from 0 258 22
worldly 0 258 22
ideologies 0 258 22
and 0 258 22
assures 0 258 22
that 0 258 22
they 0 258 22
are 0 258 22
actually 0 258 22
preaching 0 258 22
and 0 258 22
teaching 0 258 22
the 0 258 22
authentic, 0 258 22
life-giving 0 258 22
Gospel. 0 258 22

Those 0 258 23
who 0 258 23
devalue 0 258 23
the 0 258 23
doctrines 0 258 23
of 0 258 23
the 0 258 23
Church 0 258 23
[i.e., 0 258 23
Francis!] 0 258 23

separate 0 258 24
themselves 0 258 24
from 0 258 24
Jesus, 0 258 24
the 0 258 24
author 0 258 24
of 0 258 24
truth… 0 258 24
What 0 258 24
they 0 258 24
[i.e., 0 258 24
Francis] 0 258 24
then 0 258 24
possess, 0 258 24
and 0 258 24
can 0 258 24
only 0 258 24
possess, 0 258 24
is 0 258 24
an 0 258 24
ideology 0 258 24
– 0 258 24
one 0 258 24
that 0 258 24
conforms 0 258 24
to 0 258 24
the 0 258 24
world 0 258 24
of 0 258 24
sin 0 258 24
and 0 258 24
death. 0 258 24

[F]aithful 0 258 25
Catholics 0 258 25
can 0 258 25
only 0 258 25
be 0 258 25
disconcerted 0 258 25
by 0 258 25
your 0 258 25
choice 0 258 25
of 0 258 25
some 0 258 25
bishops, 0 258 25
men 0 258 25
who 0 258 25
seem 0 258 25
not 0 258 25
merely 0 258 25
open 0 258 25
to 0 258 25
those 0 258 25
who 0 258 25
hold 0 258 25
views 0 258 25
counter 0 258 25
to 0 258 25
Christian 0 258 25
belief 0 258 25
but 0 258 25
who 0 258 25
support 0 258 25
and 0 258 25
even 0 258 25
defend 0 258 25
them. 0 258 25

What 0 258 26
scandalizes 0 258 26
believers, 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
even 0 258 26
some 0 258 26
fellow 0 258 26
bishops, 0 258 26
is 0 258 26
not 0 258 26
only 0 258 26
your 0 258 26
having 0 258 26
appointed 0 258 26
such 0 258 26
men 0 258 26
to 0 258 26
be 0 258 26
shepherds 0 258 26
of 0 258 26
the 0 258 26
Church, 0 258 26
but 0 258 26
that 0 258 26
you 0 258 26
also 0 258 26
seem 0 258 26
silent 0 258 26
in 0 258 26
the 0 258 26
face 0 258 26
of 0 258 26
their 0 258 26
teaching 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
pastoral 0 258 26
practice…. 0 258 26

As 0 258 27
a 0 258 27
result, 0 258 27
many 0 258 27
of 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
faithful, 0 258 27
who 0 258 27
embody 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
"sensus 0 258 27
fidelium," 0 258 27
are 0 258 27
losing 0 258 27
confidence 0 258 27
in 0 258 27
their 0 258 27
supreme 0 258 27
shepherd. 0 258 27

[T]he 0 258 28
Church 0 258 28
is 0 258 28
one 0 258 28
body, 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
Mystical 0 258 28
Body 0 258 28
of 0 258 28
Christ, 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
you 0 258 28
are 0 258 28
commissioned 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
Lord 0 258 28
himself 0 258 28
to 0 258 28
promote 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
strengthen 0 258 28
her 0 258 28
unity. 0 258 28

But 0 258 29
your 0 258 29
actions 0 258 29
and 0 258 29
words 0 258 29
too 0 258 29
often 0 258 29
seem 0 258 29
intent 0 258 29
on 0 258 29
doing 0 258 29
the 0 258 29
opposite…. 0 258 29

You 0 258 30
have 0 258 30
often 0 258 30
spoken 0 258 30
about 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
need 0 258 30
for 0 258 30
transparency 0 258 30
within 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
Church. 0 258 30

You 0 258 31
have 0 258 31
frequently 0 258 31
encouraged… 0 258 31
all 0 258 31
persons, 0 258 31
especially 0 258 31
bishops, 0 258 31
to 0 258 31
speak 0 258 31
their 0 258 31
mind 0 258 31
and 0 258 31
not 0 258 31
be 0 258 31
fearful 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
what 0 258 31
the 0 258 31
pope 0 258 31
may 0 258 31
think. 0 258 31

But… 0 258 32
what 0 258 32
many 0 258 32
[bishops] 0 258 32
have 0 258 32
learned 0 258 32
from 0 258 32
your 0 258 32
pontificate 0 258 32
is 0 258 32
not 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
you 0 258 32
are 0 258 32
open 0 258 32
to 0 258 32
criticism, 0 258 32
but 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
you 0 258 32
resent 0 258 32
it… 0 258 32
Many 0 258 32
fear 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
if 0 258 32
they 0 258 32
speak 0 258 32
their 0 258 32
mind, 0 258 32
they 0 258 32
will 0 258 32
be 0 258 32
marginalized 0 258 32
or 0 258 32
worse. 0 258 32

I 0 258 33
have 0 258 33
often 0 258 33
asked 0 258 33
myself: 0 258 33
"Why 0 258 33
has 0 258 33
Jesus 0 258 33
let 0 258 33
all 0 258 33
of 0 258 33
this 0 258 33
happen?" 0 258 33

The 1 258 34
only 1 258 34
answer 1 258 34
that 1 258 34
comes 1 258 34
to 1 258 34
mind 1 258 34
is 1 258 34
that 1 258 34
Jesus 1 258 34
wants 1 258 34
to 1 258 34
manifest 1 258 34
just 1 258 34
how 1 258 34
weak 1 258 34
is 1 258 34
the 1 258 34
faith 1 258 34
of 1 258 34
many 1 258 34
within 1 258 34
the 1 258 34
Church, 1 258 34
even 1 258 34
among 1 258 34
too 1 258 34
many 1 258 34
of 1 258 34
her 1 258 34
bishops. 1 258 34

Ironically, 1 258 35
your 1 258 35
pontificate 1 258 35
has 1 258 35
given 1 258 35
those 1 258 35
who 1 258 35
hold 1 258 35
harmful 1 258 35
theological 1 258 35
and 1 258 35
pastoral 1 258 35
views 1 258 35
the 1 258 35
license 1 258 35
and 1 258 35
confidence 1 258 35
to 1 258 35
come 1 258 35
into 1 258 35
the 1 258 35
light 1 258 35
and 1 258 35
expose 1 258 35
their 1 258 35
previously 1 258 35
hidden 1 258 35
darkness…. 1 258 35

Father 0 258 36
Weinandy 0 258 36
reveals 0 258 36
that 0 258 36
he 0 258 36
decided 0 258 36
to 0 258 36
publicize 0 258 36
this 0 258 36
historic 0 258 36
missive 0 258 36
only 0 258 36
after 0 258 36
receiving 0 258 36
an 0 258 36
unmistakable 0 258 36
sign 0 258 36
from 0 258 36
heaven. 0 258 36

As 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
recounts 0 258 37
here, 0 258 37
after 0 258 37
repeatedly 0 258 37
“beseeching 0 258 37
Jesus 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
Mary, 0 258 37
St. 0 258 37
Peter 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
all 0 258 37
of 0 258 37

saintly 0 258 37
popes 0 258 37
who 0 258 37
are 0 258 37
buried 0 258 37
there 0 258 37

something 0 258 37
to 0 258 37
rectify 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
confusion 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
turmoil 0 258 37
within 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
Church 0 258 37
today, 0 258 37
a 0 258 37
chaos 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
an 0 258 37
uncertainty 0 258 37
that 0 258 37
I 0 258 37
felt 0 258 37
Pope 0 258 37
Francis 0 258 37
had 0 258 37
himself 0 258 37
caused,” 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
asked 0 258 37
for 0 258 37
a 0 258 37
minutely 0 258 37
specific 0 258 37
sign 0 258 37
from 0 258 37
heaven 0 258 37
on 0 258 37
whether 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
should 0 258 37
write 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
letter: 0 258 37
that 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
next 0 258 37
day 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
would 0 258 37
meet 0 258 37
someone 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
had 0 258 37
not 0 258 37
seen 0 258 37
in 0 258 37
a 0 258 37
very 0 258 37
long 0 258 37
time, 0 258 37
would 0 258 37
never 0 258 37
expect 0 258 37
to 0 258 37
see 0 258 37
in 0 258 37
Rome, 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
was 0 258 37
not 0 258 37
from 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
United 0 258 37
States, 0 258 37
Canada 0 258 37
or 0 258 37
Great 0 258 37
Britain, 0 258 37
which 0 258 37
person 0 258 37
would 0 258 37
utter 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
particular 0 258 37
phrase: 0 258 37
“Keep 0 258 37
up 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
good 0 258 37
writing.” 0 258 37

At 0 258 38
lunch 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
next 0 258 38
day, 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
sign 0 258 38
was 0 258 38
given. 0 258 38

An 0 258 39
old 0 258 39
friend 0 258 39
he 0 258 39
had 0 258 39
not 0 258 39
seen 0 258 39
in 0 258 39
more 0 258 39
than 0 258 39
twenty 0 258 39
years 0 258 39
and 0 258 39
would 0 258 39
never 0 258 39
have 0 258 39
expected 0 258 39
to 0 258 39
meet 0 258 39
in 0 258 39
Rome, 0 258 39
who 0 258 39
is 0 258 39
now 0 258 39
an 0 258 39
archbishop, 0 258 39
appeared 0 258 39
suddenly 0 258 39
from 0 258 39
between 0 258 39
two 0 258 39
parked 0 258 39
cars, 0 258 39
renewed 0 258 39
acquaintances 0 258 39
and, 0 258 39
referring 0 258 39
to 0 258 39
one 0 258 39
of 0 258 39
Father 0 258 39
Weinandy’s 0 258 39
books, 0 258 39
said: 0 258 39
“Keep 0 258 39
up 0 258 39
the 0 258 39
good 0 258 39
writing.” 0 258 39

Writes 0 258 40
Fr. 0 258 40

Weinandy: 0 258 41
“I 0 258 41
could 0 258 41
hardly 0 258 41
believe 0 258 41
that 0 258 41
this 0 258 41
just 0 258 41
happened 0 258 41
in 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
matter 0 258 41
of 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
few 0 258 41
minutes. 0 258 41

But 0 258 42
there 0 258 42
was 0 258 42
no 0 258 42
longer 0 258 42
any 0 258 42
doubt 0 258 42
in 0 258 42
my 0 258 42
mind 0 258 42
that 0 258 42
Jesus 0 258 42
wanted 0 258 42
me 0 258 42
to 0 258 42
write 0 258 42
something. 0 258 42

I 0 258 43
also 0 258 43
think 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
significant 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
was 0 258 43
an 0 258 43
Archbishop 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
Jesus 0 258 43
used. 0 258 43

I 0 258 44
considered 0 258 44
it 0 258 44
an 0 258 44
apostolic 0 258 44
mandate.” 0 258 44

Can 0 258 45
we 0 258 45
doubt 0 258 45
that 0 258 45
it 0 258 45
was 0 258 45
indeed 0 258 45
an 0 258 45
apostolic 0 258 45
mandate? 0 258 45

“In 0 258 54

plan 0 258 57
to 0 258 57
remake 0 258 57

to 0 258 57
the 0 258 57
mind 0 258 57
of 0 258 57

will 0 258 57
ultimately 0 258 57
encounter 0 258 57
a 0 258 57
resistance 0 258 57
that 0 258 57
will 0 258 57
bring 0 258 57
an 0 258 57
end 0 258 57
to 0 258 57
the 0 258 57
Latin 0 258 57
American-style 0 258 57

Francis 0 258 57

even 0 258 57
as 0 258 57
he 0 258 57
speaks 0 258 57
of 0 258 57
