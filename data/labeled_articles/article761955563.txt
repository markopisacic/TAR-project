a 0 176 29

expose 1 176 30
the 1 176 30
Islamists 1 176 30
fro 1 176 30
who 1 176 30
and 1 176 30
what 1 176 30
they 1 176 30
are 1 176 30

what 1 176 30
Islam's 1 176 30
founder 1 176 30
not 1 176 30
only 1 176 30
taught 1 176 30
them, 1 176 30
but 1 176 30
modeled 1 176 30
for 1 176 30
them, 1 176 30
and 0 176 30
you 0 176 30
may 0 176 30
