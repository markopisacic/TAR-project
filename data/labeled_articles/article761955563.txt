years 0
in 0
the 0
fire 0
service 0
as 0
a 0

for 0
Nottinghamshire, 0
yesterday 0
I 0
had 0
a 0

saying 0
that 0
I’ve 0
been 0

Robinson 0
was 0
arrested, 0
tried, 0
and 0
sentenced 0
to 0
13 0
months 0
within 1
an 1
hour 1
for 0
simply 1
reporting 0
outside 0
a 0
criminal 0
trial 0
involving 0
a 0
Muslim 0
rape 0
gang 0
at 0
Leeds 0
Crown 0
Court. 0

The 0
judge 0
also 0
put 0
a 0
gag 0
on 0
the 0
press 0
so 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
allowed 0
to 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
arrest, 0
and 0
many 0
reputable 0
outlets 0
complied 0
by 0
removing 0
their 0
stories. 0

Robinson 0
was 0
denied 0
due 0
process, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
judge. 0

Robinson 0
has 0
been 0
at 0
the 0
forefront 0
of 0
exposing 0
the 0
criminal 0
elements 0
in 0
Islam. 0

Just 0
last 0
week 0
I 0
reported 0
on 0
his 0
previous 0
comments 0
about 0
being 0
incarcerated 0
earlier 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
a 0
plot 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
prison. 0

This 0
isn't 0
far-fetched. 0

In 0
March, 0
we 0
reported 0
on 0
Britain 0
First's 0
Paul 0
Golding 0
was 0
attacked 0
by 0
two 0
inmates 0
at 0
HMP 0
Elmley, 0
on 0
the 0
Isle 0
of 0
Sheppey, 0
Kent. 0

Golding 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
on 0
7 0
March 0
at 0
Folkestone 0
Magistrates’ 0
Court 0
of 0
religiously-aggravated 0
harassment 0
alongside 0
deputy 0
leader 0
Jayda 0
Fransen 0
which 0
they 0
carried 0
out 0
in 0
Kent 0
in 0
May 0
last 0
year. 0

The 0
court 0
heard 0
the 0
pair 0
launched 0
a 0
political 0
campaign 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
trying 0
to 0
expose 0
Muslim 0
men 0
who 0
were 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
a 0
rape 0
trial. 0

So, 0
expose 1
the 1
Islamists 1
fro 1
who 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
Islam's 1
founder 1
not 1
only 1
taught 1
them, 1
but 1
modeled 1
for 1
them, 1
and 0
you 0
may 0
just 0
find 0
yourself 0
in 0
jail 0
in 0
the 0
UK. 0

Sadly, 0
the 0
same 0
scenario 0
is 0
making 0
some 0
strides 0
in 0
the 0
US, 0
as 0
well. 0

Free 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
protests 0
are 0
set 0
for 0
this 0
weekend, 0
and 0
Dutch 0
MP 0
Geert 0
Wilders 0
has 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
join 0
those 0
protests. 0

Wilders 0
has 0
called 0
Robinson's 0
imprisonment 0
a 0
"disgrace." 1

He 0
told 0
Breitbart: 0

Tommy 0
Robinson 0
was 0
arrested 0
on 0
May 0
25 0
outside 0
Leeds 0
Crown 0
Court 0
after 0
using 0
social 0
media 0
to 0
broadcast 0
details 0
of 0
an 0
ongoing 0
trial 0
which 0
was 0
subject 0
to 0
reporting 0
restrictions. 0

He 0
was 0
arrested, 0
brought 0
before 0
a 0
judge, 0
and 0
sentenced 0
within 0
five 0
hours. 0

The 0
judge 0
ordered 0
a 0
media 0
ban 0
on 0
his 0
arrest 0
and 0
imprisonment, 0
even 0
forcing 0
British 0
publications 0
to 0
delete 0
their 0
articles 0
about 0
the 0
case. 0

Such 1
measures 1
are 1
common 1
practice 1
in 1
North 1
Korea 1
and 1
Saudi 1
Arabia. 1

It 0
is 0
sad 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
Britain, 0
the 0
cradle 0
of 0
Western 0
democracy 0
and 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
law, 0
is 0
fast 0
descending 1
into 1
tyranny. 1

Tommy 1
is 1
a 1
hero. 1

It 0
is 0
a 0
disgrace 1
that 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
in 0
jail. 0

I 0
have 0
been 0
invited 0
to 0
a 0
major 0
protest 0
demonstration 0
in 0
London 0
next 0
week, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
coming. 0

Free 1
