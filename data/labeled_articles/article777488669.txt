TO 1
ARGUE 1
AGAINST 1
THE 1
DEATH 1
PENALTY 1
is 1
to 1
contend 1
with 1
constituted 1
reality. 1

Ever 0
since 0
Adam 0
and 0
Eve 0
committed 0
the 0
Original 0
Sin, 0
every 0
living 0
creature 0
is 0
subject 0
to 0
it. 0

Every 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
born 1
on 1
Death 1
Row 1
and 1
lives 1
out 1
his 1
allotted 1
lifespan 1
in 1
its 1
shadow 1
without 1
hope 1
of 1
reprieve. 1

God 0
made 0
that 0
clear 0
when 0
He 0
told 0
Adam 0
that 0
“in 0
what 0
day 0
soever” 0
he 0
preferred 0
his 0
own 0
will 0
above 0
his 0
Creator’s, 0
“thou 1
shalt 1
die 1
the 1
death,” 1
condemning 0
him 0
sooner 0
or 0
later 0
to 0
“return 0
to 0
the 0
earth 0
out 0
of 0
which 0
thou 0
wast 0
taken: 0
for 0
dust 0
thou 0
art, 0
and 0
to 0
dust 0
thou 0
shalt 0
return” 0
(Gen. 0
3:19). 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
there 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
a 1
death 1
penalty. 1

God 1
instituted 1
it, 1
and 1
He 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
impose 1
it, 1
embedding 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
fabric 1
of 1
natural 1
law. 1

When 0
Cain 0
took 0
it 0
upon 0
himself 0
to 0
inflict 0
death 0
on 0
his 0
brother 0
Abel 0
“in 0
the 0
field,” 0
he 0
soon 0
learned 0
that 0
God 0
furthermore 0
reserved 0
the 0
exercise 0
of 0
this 0
right 0
to 0
himself 0
alone. 0

Cain 0
is 0
told, 0
“What 0
hast 0
thou 0
done? 0

The 0
voice 0
of 0
thy 0
brother’s 0
blood 0
crieth 0
to 0
me 0
from 0
the 0
earth,” 0
and 0
God 1
curses 1
him 1
for 0
his 0
presumption 0
by 0
dooming 1
him 1
to 0
homelessness 0
and 0
unproductive 0
labor. 0

When 0
Cain 0
complains 0
that 0
being 0
a 1
“vagabond 1
. 0

. 0

. 0

on 0
the 0
earth, 0
every 0
one 0
therefore 0
that 0
findeth 0
me, 0
shall 0
kill 0
me,” 0
God 0
laid 0
down 0
that 0
“whoever 0
shall 0
kill 0
Cain 0
shall 0
be 0
punished 1
sevenfold,” 1
setting 0
a 0
mysterious 0
identifying 0
mark 0
on 0
him 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
from 0
the 0
vengeance 0
of 0
others. 0

The 0
Fifth 0
Commandment 0
later 0
delivered 0
to 0
Moses, 0
“Thou 0
shalt 0
not 0
kill,” 0
therefore 0
dates 0
from 0
adamic 0
times, 0
when 0
it 0
operated 0
as 0
God’s 0
exclusive 0
prerogative, 0
allowing 0
no 0
exceptions. 0

Although 0

men 0
certainly 0
continued 0
to 0
kill 0
one 0
another 0
in 0
a 0
society 0
which 0
in 0
fact 0
became 0
so 1
wicked 1
"that 0
all 0
the 0
thought 0
of 0
their 0
heart 0
was 0
bent 0
upon 0
evil 0
at 0
all 0
times," 0
they 0
did 0
so 0
as 0
murderers, 0
outside 0
God's 0
law 0
without 0
legal 0
right. 0

Only 0
after 0
the 0
Flood, 0
when 0
Noah 0
and 0
his 0
sons 0
set 0
about 0
repopulating 0
the 0
earth, 0
did 0
God 0
delegate 0
to 0
human 0
society 0
His 0
exclusive 0
authority 0
to 0
impose 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
for 0
just 0
cause. 0

He 0
told 0
Noah, 0
“For 0
I 0
will 0
require 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
your 0
lives 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
every 0
beast, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
man, 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
every 0
man, 0
and 0
of 0
his 0
brother, 0
will 0
I 0
require 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
man. 0

Whosoever 0
shall 0
shed 0
man’s 0
blood, 0
his 0
blood 0
shall 0
be 0
shed: 0
for 0
man 0
was 0
made 0
to 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
God.” 0
In 0
other 0
words, 0
from 1
that 1
point 1
in 1
history 1
lawful 1
killing 1
in 1
atonement 1
for 1
taking 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
another 1
is 1
sanctioned 1
by 1
God. 1

After 0

the 0
great 0
theophany 0
on 0
Sinai, 0
Moses 0
codified 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
old 0
law 0
of 0
talion, 0
which 0
in 0
strict 0
justice 0
required 0
“life 1
for 1
life, 1
eye 1
for 1
eye, 1
tooth 1
for 1
tooth, 1
hand 1
for 1
hand, 1
foot 1
for 1
foot” 1
(Deut. 0

19:21). 0

The 0
supreme 0
penalty 0
was 0
imposed 0
not 0
only 0
for 0
murder, 0
but 0
for 0
many 0
other 0
serious 0
offenses: 0
for 0
adultery, 0
rape, 0
sodomy, 0
kidnapping, 0
for 0
striking 0
or 0
cursing 0
parents, 0
for 0
sacrificing 0
a 0
child 0
to 0
Moloch. 0

Idolatry, 0
fortune-telling, 0
acting 0
as 0
a 0
medium, 0
preaching 0
apostasy 0
or 0
attempting 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
to 0
entice 0
another 0
from 0
the 0
faith 0
were 0
also 0
punishable 0
by 0
death, 0
as 0
was 0
blasphemy, 0
an 0
offense 0
considered 0
so 1
heinous 1
that 0
the 0
Law 0
specified, 0
“He 0
that 0
blasphemeth 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Lord, 0
dying 0
let 0
him 0
die: 0
all 0
the 0
multitude 0
shall 0
stone 0
him, 0
whether 0
he 0
be 0
a 0
native 0
or 0
a 0
stranger” 0
(Lev. 0

24:16). 0

Death 0
was 0
also 0
decreed 0
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0
priests 0
in 0
a 0
legal 0
case, 0
and 0
an 0
incorrigible 0
son 0
could 0
be 0
put 0
to 0
death 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
his 0
parents 0
before 0
the 0
proper 0
court. 0

A 0

priest’s 0
daughter 0
convicted 0
of 0
fornication 0
was 0
burned 0
to 0
death 0
(Lev. 0

21:9), 0
but 0
usually 0
the 0
sentence 0
was 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
stoning, 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
whole 0
community 0
took 0
part 0
as 0
evidence 0
that 0
no 0
private 0
parties 0
were 0
authorized 0
to 0
execute 0
a 0
criminal, 0
but 0
only 0
society 0
as 0
a 0
whole, 0
after 0
due 0
judgment. 0

Everyone 0
was 0
furthermore 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
atonement 0
due 0
to 0
God 0
for 0
a 0
crime 0
whose 0
evil 0
consequences 0
would 0
otherwise 0
have 0
affected 0
them 0
all: 0
“The 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
witnesses 0
shall 0
be 0
first 0
upon 0
him 0
to 0
kill 0
him, 0
and 0
afterwards 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
people; 0
that 0
thou 0
mayest 0
take 0
away 0
the 0
evil 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
thee” 0
(Deut. 0

17:7). 0

The 0
Law 0
read, 0
“Defile 0
not 0
the 0
land 0
of 0
your 0
habitation 0
which 0
is 0
stained 0
with 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
the 0
innocent: 0
neither 0
can 0
it 0
otherwise 0
be 0
expiated, 0
but 0
by 0
his 0
blood 0
that 0
hath 0
shed 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
another” 0
(Num. 0

35:33). 0

In 0

order 0
to 0
emphasize 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
God, 0
and 0
not 0
man, 0
who 0
is 0
always 0
the 0
principal 0
party 0
to 0
be 0
avenged, 0
provision 0
was 0
made 0
for 0
a 0
heifer 0
to 0
be 0
killed 0
as 0
propitiation 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
an 0
unsolved 0
murder 0
whose 0
perpetrator 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
found 0
(Deut. 0

20:1-9). 0

After 1
all, 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
injury 1
to 1
relatives 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
human 1
consideration 1
that 1
makes 1
homicide 1
the 1
serious 1
sin 1
that 1
it 1
is, 1
but 1
as 1
God 1
Himself 1
pointed 1
out 1
to 1
Noah, 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
“man 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
God” 1
that 1
makes 1
an 1
assault 1
on 1
him 1
tantamount 1
to 1
an 1
assault 1
on 1
God. 1

It 1
is 1
therefore 1
to 1
God, 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
His 1
creatures 1
that 1
reparation 1
is 1
primarily 1
due. 1

This 0
point 0
was 0
brought 0
out 0
by 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
in 0
an 0
address 0
to 0
Italian 0
Catholic 0
jurists 0
on 0
May 0
12, 0
1954, 0
when 0
he 0
said: 0

A 0
penalty 0
is 0
the 0
reaction 0
required 0
by 0
law 0
and 0
justice 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
fault: 0
penalty 0
and 0
fault 0
are 0
action 0
and 0
reaction. 0

Order 0
violated 0
by 0
a 0
culpable 0
act 0
demands 0
the 0
reintegration 0
and 0
re-establishment 0
of 0
the 0
disturbed 0
equilibrium 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

. 0

A 0
word 0
must 0
be 0
said 0
on 0
the 0
full 0
meaning 0
of 0
penalty. 0

Most 0
of 0
the 0
modern 0
theories 0
of 0
penal 0
law 0
explain 0
penalty 0
and 0
justify 0
it 0
in 0
the 0
final 0
analysis 0
as 0
a 0
means 0
of 0
protection, 0
that 0
is, 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
community 0
against 0
criminal 0
undertakings, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
bring 0
the 0
offender 0
to 0
observance 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

In 0
those 0
theories, 0
the 0
penalty 0
can 0
include 0
sanctions 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
diminution 0
of 0
some 0
goods 0
guaranteed 0
by 0
law, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
teach 0
the 0
guilty 0
to 0
live 0
honestly, 0
but 0
those 0
theories 0
fail 0
to 0
consider 0
the 0
expiation 0
of 0
the 0
crime 0
committed, 0
which 0
penalizes 0
the 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
law 0
as 0
the 0
prime 0
function 0
of 0
penalty 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

. 0

In 0
the 0
metaphysical 0
order, 0
penalty 0
is 0
a 0
consequence 0
of 0
dependence 0
on 0
the 0
supreme 0
will, 0
dependence 0
which 0
exists 0
in 0
the 0
deepest 0
recesses 0
of 0
created 0
being. 0

If 0
it 0
is 0
ever 0
necessary 0
to 0
hold 0
back 0
the 0
revolt 0
of 0
the 0
free 0
being 0
and 0
re-establish 0
the 0
violated 0
law, 0
it 0
is 0
when 0
that 0
is 0
required 0
by 0
the 0
supreme 0
Judge 0
and 0
supreme 0
Justice. 0

Today 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
is 0
imposed 0
ever 0
more 0
rarely, 0
even 0
in 0
cases 0
of 0
proven 0
premeditated 0
murder. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 1
was 1
instituted 1
by 1
God 1
Himself, 1
growing 0
numbers 0
of 0
Catholics 0
actually 0
consider 0
it 0
immoral. 0

John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
stopping 0
just 0
short 0
of 0
declaring 0
it 0
wrong 0
in 0
principle, 0
has 0
declared 0
that 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
imposed 0
very 0
seldom, 0
if 0
ever. 0

But 0
doesn’t 0
admitting 0
the 0
penalty 0
in 0
principle 0
demand 0
that 0
it 0
be 0
put 0
into 0
practice? 0

In 0
the 0
U.S., 0
following 0
the 0
lead 0
of 0
the 0
late 0
Cardinal 0
Bernardin 0
of 0
Chicago 0
and 0
like 0
minded 0
prelates 0
won 0
to 0
the 1
new 1
man-centered 1
conciliar 1
religion, 1
the 0
faithful 0
are 0
beginning 0
to 0
equate 0
abortion, 0
nuclear 0
war 0
and 0
capital 0
punishment 0
as 0
common 0
“threats 1
to 1
the 1
sacredness 1
of 1
human 1
life” 1
without 0
any 0
reference 0
whatever 0
to 0
the 0
innocence 0
or 0
guilt 0
involved. 0

If 0
they 0
are 0
aware 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
upheld 0
from 0
Apostolic 0
times 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
use 0
force 0
in 0
self-defense, 0
to 0
kill 0
in 0
a 0
just 0
war 0
and 0
to 0
inflict 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
on 0
those 0
duly 0
judged 0
guilty 0
of 0
serious 0
crime, 0
they 0
now 0
apparently 0
subscribe 0
to 0
the 0
notion 0
propagated 0
by 0
Dei 0
Verbum 0
at 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
that 0
the 0
unchanging 0
Catholic 0
“tradition 0
which 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
Apostles” 0
actually 0
“develops 0
in 0
the 0
Church” 0
and 0
keeps 0
pace 0
with 0
changing 0
times 0
(II,8). 0

The 0

circumstances 0
pertaining 0
to 0
our 0
day 0
would 0
therefore 0
dictate 0
a 0
reassessment 0
of 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
which 0
the 1
new 1
man-centered 1
theology 1
insists 0
on 0
viewing 0
almost 0
exclusively 0
from 0
the 0
standpoint 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
and 0
human 0
society 0
rather 0
than 0
from 0
God’s. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
there 0
is 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
discussion 0
about 0
society’s 0
responsibility 0
for 0
having 0
produced 0
criminals 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
together 0
with 0
our 0
moral 0
obligation 0
to 0
rehabilitate 0
them 0
rather 0
than 0
to 0
wreak 0
what 0
is 0
now 0
considered 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
fruitless, 1
guilty 1
“vengeance” 1
on 0
them. 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
man 0
is 0
by 0
nature 0
good 0
and 0
perfectible 0
is 0
allowed 0
to 0
override 0
all 0
documented 0
evidence 0
that 0
hardened 0
criminals 0
are 0
in 0
fact 0
almost 0
impossible 0
to 0
rehabilitate 0
and 0
that 0
those 0
handed 0
life 0
sentences 0
rarely 0
repent 0
of 0
their 0
wrongdoing. 0

According 0

to 0
one 0
widely 0
held 0
opinion, 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
has 0
proved 0
to 0
be 0
no 0
effective 0
deterrent 0
to 0
crime 0
in 0
any 0
case, 0
and 0
should 0
be 0
discarded 0
as 0
impractical. 0

What 1
proof 1
of 1
this 1
can 1
possibly 1
be 1
offered? 1

How 1
can 1
we 1
know? 1

Deterrence 0
from 0
evil 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
primary 0
purpose 0
of 0
meting 0
out 0
punishment 0
in 0
any 0
case, 0
yet 0
Scripture 0
attests 0
to 0
deterrence 0
as 0
an 0
important 0
side 0
effect 0
of 0
any 0
penalty. 0

To 0
a 0
man 0

others 0

to 0
do 0
such 0
things. 0

Thou 0

not 0

foot 1
for 1
foot” 1
(Deut. 0

19:19-21). 0

And 0
the 0
Preacher 0
notes 0
that 0
when 1
“sentence 1
is 1
not 1
speedily 1
pronounced 1
against 1
the 1
evil, 1
the 1
children 1
of 1
men 1
commit 1
evils 1
without 1
any 1
fear” 1
(Eccles. 0

8:11). 0

To 0

illustrate 0
how 1
shallow 1
Catholic 1
thinking 1
on 1
the 1
death 1
penalty 1
has 1
become 1
and 1
how 1
far 1
it 1
has 1
deviated 1
from 1
the 1
age-old 1
doctrine 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
a 0
priest 0
of 0
a 0
presumably 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
Fraternity 0
writes 0
in 0
answer 0
to 0
a 0
query 0
addressed 0
to 0
him 0
on 0
the 0
subject 0
by 0
saying: 0

The 0
death 0
penalty 0
is 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
common 0
teachings 0
of 0
theologians, 0
but 0
is 0
not 0
itself 0
a 0
declared 0
dogma. 0

Therefore 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
permissible 0
to 0
call 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
it 0
is, 0
immoral 1
heretics. 1

To 0
approach 0
this 0
as 0
a 0
dogmatic 0
teaching 0
is 0
imprudent. 1

Those 0
who 0
argue 0
for 0
its 0
abolition 0
do 0
not 0
necessarily 0
put 0
society 0
in 0
danger 0
considering 0
possibilities 0
of 0
penal 0
systems. 0

Those, 0
however, 0
who 0
maintain 0
its 0
continued 0
use 0
often 0
see 0
it 0
more 0
as 0
a 1
tool 1
for 1
revenge. 1

Please 0
consider 0
that 0
in 0
anger 0
and 0
tragedy, 0
the 0
desire 0
for 0
revenge 0
usually 0
overrides 0
reason 0
and 0
an 0
honest 0
answering 0
of 0
the 0
question 0
“must 0
this 0
person’s 0
life 0
be 0
taken 0
to 0
preserve 0
society?” 0
The 1
desire 1
for 1
swift 1
and 1
firm 1
convictions 1
has 1
sent 1
many 1
to 1
death 1
who 1
never 1
deserved 1
such 1
a 1
punishment, 1
nor 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
punishment 1
truly 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
society. 1

I 0
do 0
not 0
believe 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
is 0
necessary 0
in 0
90 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
cases 0
where 0
it 0
is 0
applied. 0

Thus 0
to 0
call 0
for 0
a 0
moratorium 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

is 0
not 0
unjust 0
or 0
incorrect. 0

That 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
can 0
become 0
an 0
instrument 0
of 0
revenge, 0
and 0
that 0
unjust 0
sentences 0
are 0
sometimes 0
handed 0
down 0
can 0
be 0
dismissed 0
as 0
irrelevant 0
to 0
the 0
argument. 0

Given 0
the 1
fallen 1
human 1
condition, 1
such 1
injustices 1
are 1
bound 1
to 1
occur 1
in 1
any 1
judicial 1
system, 1
and 0
everyone 0
agrees 0
that 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
ruthlessly 1
remedied. 1

What 0
is 0
not 0
irrelevant 0
is 0
that 0
the 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
falls 1
headlong 1
into 1
the 1
very 1
error 1
Pius 1
XII 1
warns 1
against. 1

Considering 0
the 0
physical 0
safety 0
of 0
society 0
as 0
the 0
only 0
real 0
reason 0
for 0
executing 0
a 0
criminal, 0
he 0
feels 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
can 0
now 0
be 0
safely 0
discarded, 0
allegedly 0
on 0
the 0
grounds 0
that 0
we 0
now 0
have 0
at 0
our 0
disposal 0
many 0
better 0
ways 0
of 0
protecting 0
people 0
from 0
him. 0

That 0
the 0
penalty 0
is 0
due 0
primarily 0
as 0
expiation 0
to 0
God 0
in 0
justice, 0
and 0
only 0
secondarily 0
to 0
man 0
has 0
been 0
lost 0
sight 0
of 0
altogether. 0

The 1
supernatural 1
dimension 1
of 1
the 1
punishment 1
as 0
an 0
agent 0
for 0
the 1
spiritual 1
good 1
of 0
both 0
society 0
and 0
the 0
criminal 0
is 0
furthermore 0
not 0
only 0
not 0
addressed, 0
but 0
treated 0
as 0
non-existent. 0

This 0
first 0
appeared 0
in 0
The 0
Remnant 0
nearly 0
20 0
years 0
ago. 0

Isn't 0
it 0
time 0
to 0
subscribe 0
to 0
the 0
'paper 0
of 0
record' 0
for 0
the 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
counterrevolution? 0

The 0

source 0
of 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
materialistic 0
thinking 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
not 0
hard 0
to 0
trace. 0

According 0
to 0
statistics 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
National 0
Review 0
for 0
September 0
16, 0
1983, 0
out 0
of 0
9,140 0
murders 0
committed 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
in 0
1960 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
Council, 0
56 0
persons 0
were 0
executed. 0

In 0
1965, 0
the 0
year 0
the 0
Council 0
closed, 0
although 0
the 0
tally 0
of 0
murders 0
had 0
risen 0
to 0
9,850, 0
only 0
7 0
were 0
executed. 0

In 0
the 0
decade 0
from 0
1967 0
to 0
1977 0
a 0
moratorium 0
was 0
declared 0
during 0
which 0
not 0
one 0
single 0
execution 0
took 0
place. 0

At 0
its 0
close 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
murders 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
doubled, 0
and 0
in 0
any 0
six 0
month 0
period, 0
more 0
Americans 0
were 0
being 0
murdered 0
than 0
those 0
executed 0
during 0
the 0
whole 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
century. 0

At 0
this 0
point, 0
although 0
the 0
murder 0
rate 0
has 0
continued 0
to 1
rise 1
dramatically, 1
executions 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
rare. 0

Many 0
nations, 0
notably 0
England, 0
France, 0
Sweden, 0
South 0
Africa 0
and 0
our 0
neighbors 0
Canada 0
and 0
Mexico, 0
have 1
abolished 1
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
altogether. 0

Whether 0
or 0
not 0
the 0
U. 0
S. 0
will 0
follow 0
suit 0
and 0
outlaw 0
it 0
nationally 0
still 0
remains 0
to 0
be 0
seen. 0

What 0

leaps 1
to 1
the 1
eye 1
from 0
the 0
mounting 0
statistics 0
is 0
that 0
decline 0
in 0
the 0
exercise 0
of 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
has 0
kept 0
close 0
pace 0
with 0
decline 0
in 0
the 0
Faith 0
and 0
church 0
attendance. 0

It 0
is 0
sober 0
fact 0
that 0
death 0
sentences 0
were 0
liberally 0
handed 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
heyday 0
of 0
Christendom, 0
when 0
the 0
Faith 0
was 0
strong 0
and 0
governments 0
legislated 0
with 0
an 0
eye 0
to 0
the 1
spiritual 1
welfare 1
of 1
citizens 1
whose 0
sights 0
were 0
primarily 0
on 0
future 1
bliss 1
in 1
heaven. 1

In 0
modern 0
times, 0
which 0
find 0
the 0
Church 0
strictly 0
separated 0
from 0
the 0
state 0
on 0
principle 0
and 0
denied 0
any 0
active 0
part 0
in 0
civil 0
government, 0
secularism 0
has 0
become 0
the 0
state 0
religion, 0
directing 0
legislation 0
exclusively 0
to 0
temporal 0
objectives. 0

It 0
is 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
expected 0
that 0
materialists—for 0
whom 0
the 0
immortal 0
soul 0
does 0
not 0
exist 0
and 0
who 0
believe 0
that 0
this 0
present 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
senses 0
on 0
earth 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
man 0
has—should 0
be 0
reluctant 0
to 0
punish 0
anyone 0
by 0
killing 0
him. 0

In 0
their 0
eyes 0
this 0
means 0
total 1
extinction, 1
a 0
penalty 0
certainly 0
in 0
excess 0
of 0
any 0
transgression 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
guilty. 0

Not 0

even 0
God 0
completely 1
obliterates 1
a 0
human 0
existence, 0
not 0
even 0
for 0
the 0
most 1
odious 1
sins, 1
for 0
He 0
made 0
the 0
human 0
soul 0
immortal 0
and 0
hell 0
eternal. 0

(It 0
might 0
be 0
argued, 0
however, 0
that 0
if 0
the 0
criminal 0
is 0
thought 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
have 0
totally 1
terminated 1
his 0
victim, 0
why 0
not 0
do 0
the 0
same 0
to 0
him?) 0

In 0
the 0
days 0
of 0
Christendom, 0
condemned 0
criminals 0
were 0
given 0
every 0
opportunity 0
to 0
make 0
their 0
peace 0
with 0
God, 0
in 0
many 0
cases 0
the 0
date 0
of 0
execution 0
being 0
delayed 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
accomplish 0
this 0
purpose. 0

Justice 0
was 0
served, 0
but 0
not 0
at 0
the 0
expense 0
of 0
charity, 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
question 0
of 0
taking 0
vengeance 0
on 0
the 0
culprit. 0

Nor 0
was 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
“rehabilitation” 0
with 0
possible 0
re-entry 0
into 0
society 0
ever 0
entertained 0
where 0
crimes 0
deserving 0
death 0
were 0
concerned. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
noted 0
by 0
prison 0
chaplains 0
in 0
our 0
century 0
that 0
swift 0
execution 0
in 0
most 0
cases 0
leads 0
to 0
admission 0
of 0
guilt 0
and 0
sincere 0
repentance, 0
whereas 0
those 0
who 0
receive 0
life 0
sentences 0
or 0
suffer 0
long 0
delays 0
are 0
likely 0
to 0
maintain 0
their 0
innocence 0
in 0
hopes 0
of 0
a 0
parole 0
and 0
eventually 0
die 0
in 0
their 0
sins. 0

As 0

it 0
is, 0
the 1
death 1
penalty 1
as 1
administered 1
by 1
society 1
must 1
be 1
viewed 1
against 1
the 1
backdrop 1
of 1
divine 1
revelation 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
real 1
sense. 1

When 0
Catholic 0
society 0
puts 0
a 0
man 0
to 0
death, 0
it 1
terminates 1
only 1
his 1
temporal 1
life 1
on 1
earth, 1
catapulting 1
him 1
into 1
eternity 1
for 1
his 1
final 1
judgment 1
before 1
almighty 1
God. 1

Suffering 1
the 1
penalty 1
not 1
only 1
allows 1
the 1
criminal 1
to 1
render 1
expiation 1
to 1
God 1
and 1
to 1
society, 1
but 1
if 1
accepted 1
in 1
Christ’s 1
grace 1
with 1
due 1
repentance, 1
it 1
preserves 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
hell 1
and 1
eliminates 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
purgatory. 1

If 0
his 0
contrition 0
is 0
perfect, 0
it’s 0
conceivable 0
that 0
he 0
could 0
go 0
straight 0
to 0
heaven! 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
neither 0
he 0
nor 0
society 0
is 0
any 0
longer 0
burdened 0
with 0
the 0
guilt 0
of 0
his 0
wrongdoing. 0

As 0

Michel 0
Martin 0
pointed 0
out 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
in 0
Rome 0
et 0
d’Ailleurs 0
for 0
September-October 0
1983, 0
“The 0
truth 0
is 0
that 0
the 1
problem 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
penalty 1
is 1
insoluble 1
except 1
from 1
a 1
Christian 1
point 1
of 1
view.” 1
That 0
it 0
figured 0
so 0
prominently 0
in 0
Christian 0
societies 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that, 0
in 0
the 0
order 0
of 0
charity, 0
atonement 0
to 0
God 0
was 0
sought 0
above 0
any 0
atonement 0
due 0
to 0
man, 0
and 0
the 1
spiritual 1
welfare 1
of 1
citizens 1
above 0
their 0
physical 0
well-being. 0

Modern 1
secularized 1
society 1
assumes 0
that 0
physical 1
extinction 1
is 0
the 0
worst 0
thing 0
that 0
can 0
happen 0
to 0
a 0
human 0
being, 0
whereas 0
the 1
faith 1
teaches 1
that 1
eternal 1
damnation 1
is 1
incalculably 1
worse. 1

In 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
faith, 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
a 0
man’s 0
present 0
short 0
life 0
on 0
earth 0
cannot 1
be 1
compared 1
with 1
his 1
future 1
endless 1
existence 1
in 1
heaven. 1

+++ 0

As 0
we 0
have 0
seen, 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
has 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
history. 0

Dating 0
from 0
its 0
institution 0
by 0
God 0
in 0
Eden 0
to 0
its 0
delegation 0
after 0
the 0
Flood 0
to 0
men 0
who 0
would 0
wield 0
it 0
in 0
God’s 0
name, 0
it 0
has 0
threaded 0
its 0
way 0
without 0
interruption 0
through 1
the 1
fabric 1
of 1
human 1
civilizations 1
until 0
these 0
latter 0
days. 0

One 0
might 0
expect 0
that 0
after 0
the 0
Incarnation, 0
when 0
God 0
became 0
man 0
and 0
replaced 0
the 0
Old 0
Testament’s 0
law 0
of 0
talion 0
based 0
on 0
strict 0
justice 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
dispensation 0
based 0
on 0
love 0
and 0
grace, 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
could 0
be 0
safely 0
abolished 1
as 0
outmoded. 0

Converts 1
to 1
the 1
prevailing 1
conciliar 1
religion 1
and 1
its 1
“New 1
Pentecost” 1
would 0
in 0
fact 0
argue 0
in 0
this 0
wise, 0
perhaps 0
citing 0
the 0
Council’s 0
famous 0
declaration 0
in 0
Gaudium 0
et 0
Spes 0
that, 0
“Thanks 0
to 0
the 0
experience 0
of 0
past 0
ages 0
...the 0
nature 0
of 0
man 0
himself 0
is 0
more 0
clearly 0
revealed 0
and 0
new 0
roads 0
to 0
truth 0
are 0
opened,” 0
and 0
the 0
world 0
now 0
has 0
“a 0
keener 0
awareness 0
of 0
human 0
dignity” 0
( 0
44, 0
73). 0

Far 0

from 0
obliterating 1
the 1
death 1
penalty, 1
however, 0
the 0
Incarnation 0
only 0
laid 0
bare 0
its 0
deepest 0
significance, 0
hidden 0
from 0
the 0
beginning. 0

As 0
the 0
new 0
dispensation’s 0
foremost 0
theologian, 0
St. 0
Paul 0
would 0
declare, 0
the 0
old 0
penalty 0
remained 0
very 0
much 0
in 0
force: 0
“Almost 0
all 0
things, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
law, 0
are 0
cleansed 0
with 0
blood: 0
and 0
without 1
the 1
shedding 1
of 1
blood 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
remission.” 1
It 0
is 0
still 0
“appointed 0
for 0
men 0
once 0
to 0
die, 0
and 0
after 0
this 0
the 0
judgment” 0
(Heb. 0

9: 0
22,27), 0
but 0
now 0
with 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
eternal 1
bliss 1
in 1
heaven. 1

This 0
possibility 0
is 0
owed, 0
furthermore, 0
to 0
a 0
death 0
by 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
cruelest 1
means 1
ever 1
devised, 1
unjustly 0
inflicted 0
on 0
one 0
supremely 0
innocent 0
Man 0
who 0
was 0
God, 0
in 0
a 1
miscarriage 1
of 1
human 1
justice 1
beyond 1
any 1
the 1
world 1
could 1
ever 1
have 1
imagined. 1

When 0
God 0
set 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
in 0
Eden 0
He 0
pronounced 0
it 0
on 0
Himself, 0
to 0
be 0
carried 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
fullness 0
of 0
time 0
through 0
the 0
malicious 0
free 0
wills 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
creatures. 0

The 0
Cross 0
which 0
was 0
its 0
instrument 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
sign 0
of 0
Christianity, 0
the 0
only 0
means 0
of 0
salvation. 0

Not 0

even 0
from 0
the 0
Cross 0
did 0
Christ 0
decry 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
either 0
for 0
himself 0
or 0
for 0
the 0
two 0
thieves 0
crucified 0
with 0
Him. 0

It 0
would 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
dealt 0
out 0
to 0
men 0
by 0
other 0
men 0
on 0
earth, 0
with 0
only 0
one 0
significant 0
change: 0
Henceforth 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
administered 0
under 0
the 0
authority 0
of 0
the 1
glorified 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
Christ 1
the 1
King, 1
as 0
part 0
and 0
parcel 0
of 0
that 0
universal 0
power 0
“in 0
heaven 0
and 0
on 0
earth” 0
which 0
He 0
received 0
from 0
His 0
Father 0
(Matt. 0

28:18) 0
after 0
His 0
Resurrection. 0

From 1
that 1
point 1
on 1
it 1
is 1
Christ 1
who 1
delegates 1
the 1
divine 1
authority 1
to 1
punish 1
by 1
killing, 1
and 1
both 1
Scripture 1
and 1
tradition 1
testify 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
lawfully 1
wielded 1
by 1
those 1
to 1
whom 1
He 1
entrusts 1
the 1
temporal 1
sword 1
in 1
His 1
Kingdom. 1

As 0
He 0
told 0
Pontius 0
Pilate 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
His 0
trial, 0
“Thou 0
shouldst 0
not 0
have 0
any 0
power 0
against 0
me, 0
unless 0
it 0
were 0
given 0
thee 0
from 0
above” 0
(John 0
19:10). 0

Pope 0

Leo 0
XIII 0
re-affirmed 0
this 0
truth 0
in 0
Sapientiae 0
Christianae 0
in 0
1890, 0
when 0
he 0
declared 0
that 0
“true 0
and 0
legitimate 0
authority 0
is 0
devoid 0
of 0
sanction 0
unless 0
it 0
proceed 0
from 0
God 0
the 0
supreme 0
Ruler 0
and 0
Lord 0
of 0
all. 0

The 0
Almighty 0
alone 0
can 0
commit 0
power 0
to 0
a 0
man 0
over 0
his 0
fellow 0
men.” 0
Even 0
though 0
they 0
may 0
be 0
unaware 0
of 0
the 0
true 0
source 0
of 0
their 0
power, 0
it 0
is 0
always 0
the 0
duty 0
of 0
legitimate 0
authorities 0
to 0
ensure 0
public 0
order 0
by 0
punishing 0
evil-doers, 0
by 0
death 0
if 0
appropriate. 0

As 0
St. 0
Paul 0
said: 0

Therefore 0
he 0
that 0
resisteth 0
the 0
power, 0
resisteth 0
the 0
ordinance 0
of 0
God, 0
and 0
they 0
that 0
resist 0
purchase 0
to 0
themselves 0
eternal 0
damnation. 0

For 0
rulers 0
are 0
not 0
a 0
terror 0
to 0
the 0
good 0
work, 0
but 0
to 0
the 0
evil. 0

. 0

. 0

For 0
he 0
is 0
the 0
minister 0
of 0
God 0
to 0
thee 0
for 0
good. 0

But 0
if 0
thou 0
do 0
that 0
which 0
is 0
evil, 0
fear: 0
for 0
he 0
beareth 0
not 0
the 0
sword 0
in 0
vain. 0

For 0
he 0
is 0
the 1
minister 1
of 1
God: 1
and 1
avenger 1
to 1
execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
doth 1
evil 1
(Rom. 0

13:2-4). 0

Sufficient 0
of 0
itself 0
to 0
expiate 0
every 0
sin 0
which 0
the 0
children 0
of 0
Adam 0
could 0
ever 0
commit, 0
the 0
execution 0
of 0
the 0
Man-God 0
nevertheless 0
did 0
not 0
abolish 1
the 0
penalty 0
of 0
death. 0

It 0
continues 0
to 0
be 0
the 1
wages 1
of 1
sin 1
(Rom 0
6:23), 0
and 0
men 0
must 0
still 0
submit 0
to 0
it 0
sooner 0
or 0
later 0
by 0
forfeiting 0
their 0
lives, 0
either 0
willingly 0
or 0
unwillingly. 0

A 0
share 0
in 0
making 0
restitution 0
for 0
sin 0
was 0
thus 0
accorded 0
to 0
all 0
of 0
us, 0
for 0
although 0
our 0
Lord’s 0
ignominious 0
death 0
removed 0
from 0
us 0
the 0
guilt 0
of 0
the 0
original 0
transgression 0
through 0
Baptism, 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
remove 0
its 0
effects. 0

These 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
remain 0
as 0
restraints 0
on 0
men 0
who, 0
now 0
raised 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
supernatural 0
existence, 0
were 0
capable 1
of 1
committing 1
incalculably 1
more 1
grievous 1
sins 1
than 1
heretofore. 1

As 0
for 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
it 0
remains 0
the 1
inescapable 1
consequence 1
of 1
our 1
fallen 1
nature 1
and 0
is 0
of 0
the 0
highest 0
utility 0
in 0
deterring 0
us 0
from 0
following 0
our 1
hereditary 1
inclination 1
to 1
evil. 1

What 0

Christ 0
did 0
was 0
to 0
sanctify 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
transforming 0
it 0
into 0
a 0
sacrament 0
of 0
life 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
believe. 0

As 0
St. 0
Paul 0
declared, 0
“Death 0
is 0
swallowed 0
up 0
in 0
victory. 0

O 0
death, 0
where 0
is 0
thy 0
victory? 0

O 0
death, 0
where 0
is 0
thy 0
sting?. 0

. 0

. 0

For 0
by 0
a 0
man 0
came 0
death, 0
and 0
by 0
a 0
man 0
the 0
resurrection 0
of 0
the 0
dead. 0

And 0
as 0
in 0
Adam 0
all 0
die, 0
so 0
also 0
in 0
Christ 0
all 0
shall 0
be 0
made 0
alive” 0
(1 0
Cor. 0

15: 0
54-55; 0
21-22). 0

The 0
first 0
of 0
that 0
numberless 0
host 0
of 0
Christian 0
martyrs 0
who 0
would 0
be 0
put 0
to 0
death 0
by 0
constituted 0
authority 0
for 0
testifying 0
to 0
the 0
truth, 0
Christ 0
commanded 0
His 0
disciples 0
to 0
“Follow 0
me!” 0
Inviting 0
all 0
to 0
Calvary 0
to 0
“suffer 0
under 0
Pontius 0
Pilate” 0
with 0
Him, 0
He 0
granted 0
a 0
meritorious 0
share 0
in 0
accomplishing 0
“the 0
mystery 0
which 0
hath 0
been 0
hidden 0
for 0
ages 0
and 0
generations, 0
but 0
is 0
now 0
made 0
manifest 0
to 0
his 0
saints” 0
to 0
all 0
who, 0
like 0
St. 0
Paul, 0
would 0
“now 0
rejoice 0
in 0
my 0
sufferings 0
for 0
you 0
and 0
fill 0
up 0
those 0
things 0
which 0
are 0
wanting 0
of 0
the 0
sufferings 0
of 0
Christ 0
in 0
my 0
flesh, 0
for 0
his 0
body 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
church. 0

. 0

.” 0
(Col. 0
1:26, 0
24). 0

Criminals 0

put 0
to 0
death 0
undergo 0
a 0
penalty 0
no 0
different 0
from 0
the 0
one 0
exacted 0
from 0
the 0
most 0
innocent 0
amongst 0
us. 0

As 1
with 1
everyone 1
else 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
death 1
ushers 1
them 1
either 1
into 1
heaven, 1
hell 1
or 1
purgatory. 1

The 0
most 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
said 0
is 0
that 0
their 0
lives 0
here 0
on 0
earth 0
are 0
shortened, 0
and 0
they 0
must 0
settle 1
their 1
accounts 1
sooner 0
than 0
expected. 0

This 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
great 0
mercy 0
for 0
them 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
for 0
society, 0
both 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
expiation 0
and 0
protection 0
from 0
any 0
future 0
crimes 0
they 0
might 0
have 0
perpetrated. 0

The 0
death 0
penalty, 0
from 0
the 0
first 0
one 0
imposed 0
on 0
man 0
by 0
God 0
in 0
the 0
beginning 0
in 0
Eden, 0
to 0
the 0
one 0
imposed 0
on 0
God 0
by 0
man 0
on 0
that 0
Good 0
Friday 0
in 0
Jerusalem, 0
on 0
down 0
to 0
those 0
still 0
being 0
imposed 0
today, 0
transcends 1
human 1
legislation. 1

By 1
divine 1
decree 1
it 1
will 1
perdure 1
until 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
time, 1
when 1
“the 1
former 1
things 1
are 1
passed 1
away.” 1
Only 1
then 1
“death 1
shall 1
be 1
no 1
more, 1
nor 1
mourning, 1
nor 1
crying, 1
nor 1
sorrow 1
shall 1
be 1
any 1
more,” 1
and 1
not 1
one 1
minute 1
sooner. 1

(Apo. 0

21:4). 0
