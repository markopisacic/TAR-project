“When 0 110 5

the 0 110 8

But 0 110 9
again, 0 110 9
it’s 0 110 9
not 0 110 9
just 0 110 9
the 0 110 9

this 0 110 14

why. 0 110 14

At 0 110 15
the 0 110 15

personally 0 110 15

three 0 110 16
in 0 110 16

Our 0 110 17

couldn't 1 110 17
be 1 110 17
happier 1 110 17

to 0 110 17
homeschool---yes, 0 110 17
all 0 110 17
the 0 110 17

Perhaps 0 110 22

a 0 110 22
couple 0 110 22
of 0 110 22

will 0 110 22

those 0 110 22

to 0 110 23
home-schooling 0 110 23
your 0 110 23
children. 0 110 23

I 0 110 24
realize 0 110 24
it’s 0 110 24
a 0 110 24
challenge, 0 110 24
but 0 110 24
few 0 110 24
challenges 0 110 24
have 0 110 24
greater 0 110 24

in 0 110 24
this 0 110 24

the 0 110 24
next. 0 110 24

There 1 110 25
is 1 110 25
no 1 110 25
better 1 110 25
way 1 110 25
to 1 110 25
keep 1 110 25
the 1 110 25
Catholic 1 110 25
