According 0

a 0
33-year-long 0
study 0
conducted 0
by 0
the 0
National 0

Research 0
Institute 0
in 0
Oregon, 0
the 0
top 0
three 0
reasons 0
that 0
parents 0
choose 0
homeschooling 0
are 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
provide 0
religious 0
instruction 0
or 0
different 0
values 0
than 0
those 0
offered 0
in 0
public 0
schools; 0
dissatisfaction 0
with 0
the 0
academic 0
curriculum, 0
and 0
worries 0
about 0
the 0
school 0
environment. 0

As 0
reported 0
by 0
The 0
Washington 0
Times, 0
the 0
recent 0
school 1
shooting 1
at 0
Parkland, 0
Fla., 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
straw 0
for 0
scores 0
of 0
parents. 0

The 0
paper 0
noted 0
that 0
“the 0
phones 0
started 0
ringing 0
at 0
the 0
Texas 0
Home 0
School 0
Coalition, 0
and 0
they 0
haven’t 0
stopped 0
yet.” 0

The 0
Times 0
added:The 0
Lubbock-based 0
organization 0
has 0
been 0
swamped 1
with 0
inquiries 0
for 0
months 0
from 0
parents 0
seeking 0
safer 0
options 0
for 0
their 0
kids 0
in 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
this 0
year’s 0
deadly 1
school 1
massacres, 1
first 0
in 0
Parkland 0
and 0
then 0
in 0
Santa 0
Fe, 0
Texas. 0

“When 0
the 0
Parkland 0
shooting 1
happened, 0
our 0
phone 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
exploded,” 1
said 0
coalition 0
president 0
Tim 0
Lambert. 0

“In 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
months, 0
our 0
numbers 0
have 0
doubled. 0

We’re 0
dealing 0
with 0
probably 0
between 0
1,200 0
and 0
1,400 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
per 0
month, 0
and 0
prior 0
to 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
600 0
to 0
700.” 0

While 0
the 0
debate 0
rages 0
anew 0
over 0
familiar 0
topics 0
following 0
such 0
tragedies 0
— 0
tougher, 0
more 0
restrictive 0
gun 0
control 0
laws 0
and 0
bolstering 0
security 0
at 0
public 0
schools 0
— 0
the 0
revolution 1
in 0
homeschooling 0
has 0
been 0
taking 0
place 0
quietly, 0
behind 0
the 0
scenes 0
and 0
off 0
the 0
radar 0
screens 0
of 0
most 0
political 0
organizations. 0

But 0
again, 0
it’s 0
not 0
just 0
the 0
shootings, 1
which 0
admittedly 0
have 0
increased 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
couple 0
of 0
years. 0

Christopher 0

are 0

up 0
with 0
“the 0
violence, 1
the 0

the 0

The 0
Left 0
is 0
driving 0
more 0

OUT 0
of 0
public 0

There 0
is 0

The 0

REMNANT 0
COMMENT: 0
We 0
here 0
at 0
The 0
Remnant 0
are 0
always 0
eager 0
to 0
promote 0
the 0
home-schooling 0
movement, 0
and 0
this 0
report 0
helps 0
illustrate 0
why. 0

At 0
the 0
moment 0
and 0
personally 0
speaking, 0
my 0
own 0
family’s 0
home-school 0
is 0
going 0
great 0
guns. 0

We 0
have 0
a 0
daughter 0
still 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
and 0
three 0
in 0
grade 0
school. 0

Our 0
family 0
couldn't 1
be 1
happier 1
with 0
our 0
decision 0
to 0
homeschool---yes, 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
through 0
high 0
school. 0

And 0
as 0
for 0
our 0
older 0
home-schooled 0
children: 0
My 0
third-eldest 0
child 0
is 0
preparing 0
to 0
head 0
off 0
to 0
college 0
in 0
the 0
fall. 0

Her 0
older 0
sister 0
just 0
finished 0
a 0
semester 0
studying 0
in 0
Austria 0
and 0
will 0
graduate 0
with 0
a 0
double 0
major 0
and 0
a 0
minor 0
degree 0
next 0
spring. 0

My 0
son 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
junior 0
this 0
fall, 0
working 0
on 0
a 0
Mass 0
Communications 0
degree 0
at 0
Franciscan 0
University. 0

Here's 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
his 0
work: 0

Perhaps 0
this 0
video 0
from 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
ago 0
will 0
be 0
useful 0
to 0
those 0
considering 0
home-schooling 0
this 0
fall: 0

Friends, 0
please 0
give 0
serious 0
thought 0
and 0
prayer 0
to 0
home-schooling 0
your 0
children. 0

I 0
realize 0
it’s 0
a 0
challenge, 0
but 0
few 0
challenges 0
have 0
greater 0
payoffs 0
in 0
this 0
world 0
or 0
the 0
next. 0

There 1
is 1
no 1
better 1
way 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
Catholic 1
family 1
together 1
and 1
committed 1
to 1
the 1
Catholic 1
restoration 1
than 1
the 1
Catholic 1
