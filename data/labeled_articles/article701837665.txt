While 0 45 1
the 0 45 1
mainstream 0 45 1
media 0 45 1
was 0 45 1
announcing 0 45 1
for 0 45 1
the 0 45 1
past 0 45 1
two 0 45 1
weeks 0 45 1
that 0 45 1
President 0 45 1

was 0 45 1
going 0 45 1

On 0 45 2
Monday 0 45 2
of 0 45 2
this 0 45 2

I 0 45 2
predicted 0 45 2
that 0 45 2

make 0 45 2
a 0 45 2
deal 0 45 2
with 0 45 2
the 0 45 2
CIA 0 45 2
that 0 45 2
would 0 45 2
enable 0 45 2
the 0 45 2
CIA 0 45 2
to 0 45 2
continue 0 45 2
its 0 45 2

Donald 1 45 7
“Art 1 45 7

Trump 1 45 7
was 0 45 7

negotiating 0 45 7
all 0 45 7
week 0 45 7
with 0 45 7
the 0 45 7

and 0 45 7
he 0 45 7
was 0 45 7
obviously 0 45 7
pushing 0 45 7
to 0 45 7
get 0 45 7
what 0 45 7
he 0 45 7
wanted 0 45 7

undoubtedly 0 45 8

and 0 45 8
Trump 0 45 8
presumably 0 45 8
got 0 45 8
what 0 45 8
he 0 45 8
wanted 0 45 8
in 0 45 8

Some 0 45 10

are 0 45 10
criticizing 0 45 10

Displaying 0 45 11
their 0 45 11

they 1 45 11

As 0 45 11
I 0 45 11
indicated 0 45 11
in 0 45 11
my 0 45 11
Monday 0 45 11

going 0 45 11
to 0 45 11

The 0 45 13
fact 0 45 13
is 0 45 13
that 0 45 13
the 0 45 13
CIA 0 45 13
put 0 45 13
in 0 45 13
its 0 45 13
request 0 45 13
to 0 45 13
Trump 0 45 13
for 0 45 13
continued 0 45 13

of 0 45 13
its 0 45 13

long 0 45 13
before 0 45 13
yesterday. 0 45 13

But 0 45 14
“Art 1 45 14
of 1 45 14
the 1 45 14
Deal” 1 45 14
Trump 1 45 14
obviously 1 45 14
sat 1 45 14
on 1 45 14
the 1 45 14
request, 1 45 14
undoubtedly 1 45 14
hoping 1 45 14
that 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
could 1 45 14
get 1 45 14
what 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
wanted 1 45 14
in 1 45 14
return 1 45 14
if 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
just 1 45 14
continued 1 45 14
holding 1 45 14
out 1 45 14
and 1 45 14
conveying 1 45 14
that 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
was 1 45 14
ready 1 45 14
to 1 45 14
release 1 45 14
the 1 45 14
records. 1 45 14

Don’t 0 45 15
forget: 0 45 15
According 0 45 15
to 0 45 15
Trump’s 0 45 15
own 0 45 15
tweets, 0 45 15
he 0 45 15
had 0 45 15
already 0 45 15
ostensibly 0 45 15
decided 0 45 15
to 0 45 15
deny 0 45 15
the 0 45 15

sent 0 45 16
on 0 45 16
Saturday, 0 45 16
October 0 45 16

“Subject 0 45 16

So 1 45 17
interesting! 1 45 17

Now, 0 45 18
it’s 0 45 18
theoretically 0 45 18
possible 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
the 0 45 18
CIA 0 45 18
presented 0 45 18
Trump 0 45 18
with 1 45 18
some 1 45 18
earthshattering 1 45 18
new 1 45 18
information 1 45 18
on 0 45 18
the 0 45 18
Thursday 0 45 18
deadline 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
showed 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
the 1 45 18
United 1 45 18
States 1 45 18
would 1 45 18
fall 1 45 18
into 1 45 18
the 1 45 18
ocean 1 45 18
if 1 45 18
Americans 1 45 18
were 1 45 18
finally 1 45 18
permitted 1 45 18
to 1 45 18
see 1 45 18
the 1 45 18
CIA’s 1 45 18
long-secret 1 45 18
JFK 0 45 18
records. 0 45 18

But 1 45 19
how 1 45 19
likely 1 45 19
is 1 45 19
that? 1 45 19

Not 0 45 20
likely 0 45 20
at 0 45 20
all! 0 45 20

Instead, 0 45 21
it 1 45 21
is 1 45 21
a 1 45 21
virtual 1 45 21
certainly 1 45 21
that 1 45 21
when 1 45 21
Art 1 45 21
of 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
Deal 1 45 21
Trump 1 45 21
sent 1 45 21
out 1 45 21
those 1 45 21
two 1 45 21
tweets, 1 45 21
he 1 45 21
was 1 45 21
sending 1 45 21
a 1 45 21
message 1 45 21
to 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
CIA 1 45 21
as 1 45 21
part 1 45 21
of 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
negotiations: 1 45 21
Give 1 45 21
me 1 45 21
what 1 45 21
I 1 45 21
want 1 45 21
or 1 45 21
I 1 45 21
will 1 45 21
release 1 45 21
the 1 45 21

In 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
negotiations, 0 45 22
both 0 45 22
Trump 0 45 22
and 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
CIA 0 45 22
knew 0 45 22
that 0 45 22

was 0 45 22
in 0 45 22
the 0 45 22

In 0 45 24
the 0 45 24
end, 0 45 24
the 0 45 24
CIA 0 45 24
blinked, 0 45 24
just 0 45 24
as 0 45 24
Trump 0 45 24
knew 0 45 24
it 0 45 24
would. 0 45 24

Contrary 0 45 25
to 0 45 25
what 0 45 25
the 0 45 25
mainstream 0 45 25
press 0 45 25
is 0 45 25
asserting, 0 45 25
the 1 45 25
records 1 45 25
undoubtedly 1 45 25
contain 1 45 25
more 1 45 25
incriminating 1 45 25
circumstantial 1 45 25
evidence 1 45 25
that 1 45 25
fills 1 45 25
in 1 45 25
the 1 45 25
mosaic 1 45 25
of 1 45 25
a 1 45 25
U.S. 1 45 25
national-security 1 45 25
regime-change 1 45 25
operation 1 45 25
on 1 45 25
November 1 45 25
22, 1 45 25
1963. 1 45 25

That’s 0 45 26
what 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
mainstream 0 45 26
media, 0 45 26
forever 0 45 26
wedded 0 45 26
to 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
official 0 45 26
story 0 45 26
no 0 45 26
matter 0 45 26
how 0 45 26
ridiculous 1 45 26
and 1 45 26
illogical 1 45 26
it 0 45 26
is, 0 45 26
simply 0 45 26
cannot 0 45 26
bring 0 45 26
themselves 0 45 26
to 0 45 26
confront. 0 45 26

Trump 0 45 27
knew 0 45 27
that 0 45 27
he 0 45 27
had 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
CIA 0 45 27
over 0 45 27
a 0 45 27
barrel. 0 45 27

As 0 45 28
I 0 45 28
indicated 0 45 28
in 0 45 28
my 0 45 28
two 0 45 28
articles 0 45 28
this 0 45 28
week, 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
CIA 0 45 28
was 0 45 28
between 0 45 28
a 0 45 28
rock 0 45 28
and 0 45 28
a 0 45 28
hard 0 45 28
place. 0 45 28

On 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
one 0 45 29
hand, 0 45 29
it 0 45 29
could 0 45 29
refuse 0 45 29
to 0 45 29
grant 0 45 29
Trump 0 45 29
what 0 45 29
he 0 45 29
wanted 0 45 29
and 0 45 29
let 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
records 0 45 29
be 0 45 29
released, 0 45 29
which 0 45 29
it 1 45 29
knew 1 45 29
would 1 45 29
point 1 45 29
to 1 45 29
the 1 45 29
CIA’s 1 45 29
guilt 1 45 29
in 1 45 29
the 1 45 29
assassination. 1 45 29

On 0 45 30
the 0 45 30
other 0 45 30
hand, 0 45 30
it 0 45 30
could 0 45 30
give 0 45 30
Trump 0 45 30
what 0 45 30
he 0 45 30
wanted 0 45 30
and 0 45 30
have 0 45 30
to 0 45 30
suffer 0 45 30
the 1 45 30
obvious 1 45 30
inference 1 45 30
that 1 45 30
people 1 45 30
would 1 45 30
draw 1 45 30
— 1 45 30
that 1 45 30
the 1 45 30
CIA 1 45 30
was 1 45 30
continuing 1 45 30
to 1 45 30
cover 1 45 30
up 1 45 30
incriminatory 1 45 30
evidence. 1 45 30

What 0 45 31
did 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
CIA 0 45 31
give 0 45 31
Trump 0 45 31
in 0 45 31
return 0 45 31
for 0 45 31
Trump’s 0 45 31
extending 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
CIA’s 0 45 31
50-year-plus 0 45 31
secrecy? 0 45 31

We 0 45 32
don’t 0 45 32
know, 0 45 32
but 0 45 32
my 0 45 32
hunch 0 45 32
is 0 45 32
that 0 45 32
it 0 45 32
pertains 0 45 32
to 0 45 32
Russia. 0 45 32

Here’s 0 45 33
my 0 45 33
next 0 45 33
prediction: 0 45 33
the 0 45 33
congressional 0 45 33
investigations 0 45 33
into 0 45 33
Trump’s 0 45 33
supposed 0 45 33
“collusion” 0 45 33
with 0 45 33
Russia 0 45 33
are 0 45 33
about 0 45 33
to 0 45 33
fizzle 0 45 33
out. 0 45 33

That’s 0 45 34
because 0 45 34
I 0 45 34
believe 0 45 34
that 0 45 34
the 0 45 34
CIA, 0 45 34
as 0 45 34
part 0 45 34
of 0 45 34
its 0 45 34
deal 0 45 34
with 0 45 34
Trump, 0 45 34
will 0 45 34
order 0 45 34
its 0 45 34
assets 0 45 34
in 0 45 34
Congress 0 45 34
to 0 45 34
cease 0 45 34
and 0 45 34
desist 0 45 34
with 0 45 34
respect 0 45 34
to 0 45 34
that 0 45 34
investigation. 0 45 34

In 0 45 35
my 0 45 35
opinion, 0 45 35
that’s 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
price 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
CIA 0 45 35
had 0 45 35
to 0 45 35
pay 0 45 35
in 0 45 35
return 0 45 35
for 0 45 35
its 0 45 35
continued 0 45 35
cover-up 0 45 35
of 0 45 35
its 0 45 35
U.S. 0 45 35
regime-change 0 45 35
operation 0 45 35
in 0 45 35
November 0 45 35
1963. 0 45 35

Notice 0 45 36
something 0 45 36
else 0 45 36
about 0 45 36
the 0 45 36
deal 0 45 36
that 0 45 36
Trump 0 45 36
has 0 45 36
presumably 0 45 36
made 0 45 36
with 0 45 36
the 0 45 36
CIA: 0 45 36
The 0 45 36
secrecy 0 45 36
arrangement 0 45 36
extends 0 45 36
only 0 45 36
to 0 45 36
April. 0 45 36

Ostensibly, 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
next 0 45 37
six 0 45 37
months 0 45 37
are 0 45 37
needed 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
carefully 0 45 37
review 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
records 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
determine 0 45 37
whether 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
records 0 45 37
really 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
relate 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
“national 0 45 37
security.” 0 45 37

Not 0 45 38
surprisingly, 0 45 38
the 0 45 38
mainstream 0 45 38
media 0 45 38
isn’t 1 45 38
even 1 45 38
questioning 1 45 38
that 1 45 38
ludicrous 1 45 38
notion. 1 45 38

For 0 45 39
more 0 45 39
than 0 45 39
50 0 45 39
years, 0 45 39
the 0 45 39
CIA 0 45 39
has 0 45 39
known 0 45 39
why 0 45 39
it 0 45 39
has 0 45 39
wanted 0 45 39
those 0 45 39
particular 0 45 39
records 0 45 39
to 0 45 39
be 0 45 39
kept 0 45 39
secret. 0 45 39

During 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
term 0 45 40
of 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
Assassination 0 45 40
Records 0 45 40
Review 0 45 40
Board 0 45 40
in 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
1990s, 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
CIA 0 45 40
decided 0 45 40
to 0 45 40
keep 0 45 40
these 0 45 40
particular 0 45 40
records 0 45 40
secret 0 45 40
for 0 45 40
another 0 45 40
25 0 45 40
years. 0 45 40

There 0 45 41
are 0 45 41
bound 0 45 41
to 0 45 41
be 0 45 41
lots 0 45 41
of 0 45 41
CIA 0 45 41
memoranda 0 45 41
detailing 0 45 41
why 0 45 41
it 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
imperative 0 45 41
to 0 45 41
keep 0 45 41
these 0 45 41
particular 0 45 41
records 0 45 41
secret 0 45 41
for 0 45 41
as 0 45 41
long 0 45 41
as 0 45 41
possible. 0 45 41

Finally, 0 45 42
the 0 45 42
CIA 0 45 42
made 0 45 42
its 0 45 42
request 0 45 42
for 0 45 42
secrecy 0 45 42
to 0 45 42
Trump 0 45 42
at 0 45 42
least 0 45 42
several 0 45 42
weeks 0 45 42
ago. 0 45 42

The 0 45 43
notion 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
CIA 0 45 43
suddenly 0 45 43
hit 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
yesterday 0 45 43
with 0 45 43
a 0 45 43
new 0 45 43
argument 0 45 43
as 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
why 0 45 43
“national 0 45 43
security” 0 45 43
would 0 45 43
be 0 45 43
threatened, 0 45 43
after 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
had 0 45 43
supposedly 0 45 43
already 0 45 43
rejected 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
arguments 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
had 0 45 43
been 0 45 43
presented 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
him, 0 45 43
causing 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
suddenly 0 45 43
change 0 45 43
his 0 45 43
mind, 0 45 43
is, 1 45 43
well, 1 45 43
laughable. 1 45 43

So, 0 45 44
why 0 45 44
the 0 45 44
April 0 45 44
deadline? 0 45 44

Why 0 45 45
not 0 45 45
extend 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
secrecy 0 45 45
for 0 45 45
another 0 45 45
25 0 45 45
years, 0 45 45
which 0 45 45
is 0 45 45
undoubtedly 0 45 45
what 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
CIA 0 45 45
wanted? 0 45 45

Because 0 45 46
Trump 0 45 46
obviously 0 45 46
needed 0 45 46
collateral 0 45 46
to 0 45 46
ensure 0 45 46
that 0 45 46
the 0 45 46
CIA 0 45 46
complied 0 45 46
with 0 45 46
its 0 45 46
part 0 45 46
of 0 45 46
the 0 45 46
deal. 0 45 46

If 0 45 47
Trump 0 45 47
had 0 45 47
extended 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
secrecy 0 45 47
for 0 45 47
25 0 45 47
years, 0 45 47
he 0 45 47
would 0 45 47
have 0 45 47
lost 0 45 47
leverage 0 45 47
to 0 45 47
ensure 0 45 47
that 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
CIA 0 45 47
complied 0 45 47
with 0 45 47
its 0 45 47
part 0 45 47
of 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
bargain. 0 45 47

Let’s 0 45 48
say, 0 45 48
hypothetically, 0 45 48
that 0 45 48
I’m 0 45 48
right: 0 45 48
that 0 45 48
the 0 45 48
CIA 0 45 48
agreed 0 45 48
to 0 45 48
use 0 45 48
its 0 45 48
assets 0 45 48
in 0 45 48
Congress 0 45 48
to 0 45 48
shut 0 45 48
down 0 45 48
the 0 45 48
Russia 0 45 48
investigation. 0 45 48

To 0 45 49
make 0 45 49
certain 0 45 49
that 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
CIA 0 45 49
fulfills 0 45 49
its 0 45 49
part 0 45 49
of 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
bargain, 0 45 49
Trump 0 45 49
would 0 45 49
need 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
April 0 45 49
deadline 0 45 49
so 0 45 49
that 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
threat 0 45 49
of 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
records 0 45 49
release 0 45 49
would 0 45 49
continue 0 45 49
hanging 0 45 49
over 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
CIA. 0 45 49

If 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
CIA 0 45 50
fails 0 45 50
to 0 45 50
fulfill 0 45 50
its 0 45 50
part 0 45 50
of 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
bargain, 0 45 50
Trump 0 45 50
releases 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
records 0 45 50
in 0 45 50
April. 0 45 50

If 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
CIA 0 45 51
squelches 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
Russia 0 45 51
investigations, 0 45 51
Trump 0 45 51
grants 0 45 51
another 0 45 51
extension 0 45 51
of 0 45 51
time 0 45 51
in 0 45 51
April. 0 45 51

Let’s 1 45 52
state 1 45 52
the 1 45 52
obvious: 1 45 52
The 1 45 52
CIA 1 45 52
records 1 45 52
that 1 45 52
are 1 45 52
still 1 45 52
being 1 45 52
suppressed 1 45 52
have 1 45 52
nothing 1 45 52
to 1 45 52
do 1 45 52
with 1 45 52
“national 1 45 52
security.” 1 45 52
They 1 45 52
have 1 45 52
everything 1 45 52
to 1 45 52
do 1 45 52
with 1 45 52
covering 1 45 52
up 1 45 52
the 1 45 52
CIA’s 1 45 52
role 1 45 52
in 0 45 52
the 0 45 52
U.S. 0 45 52

that 0 45 52
took 0 45 52
place 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
Dallas 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
November 0 45 52
1963, 0 45 52
which 0 45 52
succeeded 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
ousting 0 45 52
from 0 45 52
power 0 45 52
a 0 45 52
president 0 45 52
who 0 45 52
was, 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
the 0 45 52
eyes 0 45 52
of 0 45 52

that 0 45 53
constituted 0 45 53
a 1 45 53
grave 1 45 53
threat 1 45 53
to 1 45 53
“national 1 45 53
security,” 1 45 53
i.e., 1 45 53
befriending 1 45 53
the 1 45 53
Russians 1 45 53
(i.e., 1 45 53
the 1 45 53
Soviets) 1 45 53
and 1 45 53
Cubans 1 45 53
and 1 45 53
entering 1 45 53

coexistence 1 45 53
with 1 45 53
the 1 45 53

world. 1 45 53

In 0 45 54
other 0 45 54
words, 0 45 54
unlike 0 45 54
Lee 0 45 54

who 1 45 54

no 1 45 54

to 1 45 54

Kennedy, 1 45 54
the 0 45 54

did 0 45 54

a 0 45 54
powerful 0 45 54
motive, 0 45 54
the 1 45 54
same 1 45 54
motive 1 45 54
that 1 45 54
motivated 1 45 54
the 1 45 54

Review 0 45 55
Board 0 45 55
in 0 45 55
the 0 45 55
1990s. 0 45 55

Immediately 0 45 56
upon 0 45 56
the 0 45 56
arrest 0 45 56
of 0 45 56
Lee 0 45 56
Harvey 0 45 56
Oswald, 0 45 56
the 0 45 56
official 0 45 56
account 0 45 56
was 0 45 56
that 0 45 56
this 0 45 56
was 0 45 56
just 0 45 56
a 1 45 56
lone 1 45 56
nut, 1 45 56
former 1 45 56
U.S. 1 45 56
Marine 1 45 56
communist 1 45 56
who 0 45 56
decided, 0 45 56
for 0 45 56
no 0 45 56
apparent 0 45 56
reason, 0 45 56
to 0 45 56
assassinate 0 45 56
Kennedy. 0 45 56

One 0 45 57
big 0 45 57
problem 0 45 57
is 0 45 57
the 0 45 57
official 0 45 57
story, 0 45 57
however, 0 45 57
requires 0 45 57
a 0 45 57
suspension 1 45 57
of 1 45 57
logic 1 45 57
and 1 45 57
common 1 45 57
sense. 1 45 57

For 0 45 58
anyone 0 45 58
who 0 45 58
has 0 45 58
a 0 45 58
mindset 0 45 58
of 0 45 58
conformity 0 45 58
and 0 45 58
deference 0 45 58
to 0 45 58
authority, 0 45 58
that 0 45 58
story 0 45 58
makes 0 45 58
sense 0 45 58
because 0 45 58
nothing 0 45 58
is 0 45 58
questioned 0 45 58
or 0 45 58
challenged. 0 45 58

For 1 45 59
anyone 1 45 59
who 1 45 59
has 1 45 59
a 1 45 59
critical, 1 45 59
analytical, 1 45 59
independent 1 45 59
mindset, 1 45 59
the 1 45 59
official 1 45 59
story 1 45 59
is 1 45 59
filled 1 45 59
with 1 45 59
holes. 1 45 59

For 0 45 60
example, 0 45 60
how 0 45 60
many 0 45 60
communist 0 45 60
Marines 0 45 60
have 0 45 60
you 0 45 60
ever 0 45 60
heard 0 45 60
of? 0 45 60

Why 0 45 61
would 0 45 61
a 0 45 61
genuine 0 45 61
communist 0 45 61
join 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
Marines 0 45 61
in 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
first 0 45 61
place, 0 45 61
especially 0 45 61
since 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
Marines 0 45 61
had 0 45 61
just 0 45 61
recently 0 45 61
killed 0 45 61
millions 0 45 61
of 0 45 61
North 0 45 61
Korean 0 45 61
communists? 0 45 61

Why 0 45 62
would 0 45 62
a 0 45 62
genuine 0 45 62
communist 0 45 62
join 0 45 62
the 0 45 62

How 0 45 63
many 0 45 63

do 0 45 63
you 0 45 63

about 0 45 68
how 0 45 68
the 0 45 68

suspects 0 45 68
are 0 45 68

or 0 45 68
traitors. 0 45 68

It 1 45 69
skewers 1 45 69
them. 1 45 69

Why, 0 45 70
just 0 45 70
look 0 45 70
at 0 45 70
how 0 45 70
they 1 45 70
call 1 45 70
Julian 1 45 70

a 1 45 70

and 0 45 70
he 0 45 70
isn’t 0 45 70
even 0 45 70

The 0 45 73
entire 0 45 73
U.S. 0 45 73
anti-communist 0 45 73
crusade, 0 45 73
including 0 45 73
Vietnam, 0 45 73
which 0 45 73
more 0 45 73
than 0 45 73
58,000 0 45 73
U.S. 0 45 73
soldiers 0 45 73
died 0 45 73
killing 0 45 73
communists. 0 45 73

And 0 45 74
they’re 0 45 74
going 0 45 74
to 0 45 74
tell 0 45 74
us 0 45 74
that 0 45 74

just 0 45 74
let 0 45 74

supposed 0 45 74
self-avowed 1 45 74
communist 1 45 74
skate 1 45 74
blissfully 1 45 74
across 1 45 74

Cold 1 45 74
War 1 45 74
stage 1 45 74
of 1 45 74
history 1 45 74

nary 1 45 74
any 1 45 74
abuse 1 45 74
or 1 45 74

at 1 45 74
all? 1 45 74

Don’t 1 45 75
make 1 45 75
me 1 45 75
laugh. 1 45 75

Soon 0 45 76
after 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Warren 0 45 76
Commission 0 45 76
was 0 45 76
established, 0 45 76
Warren 0 45 76
called 0 45 76
a 0 45 76
super-secret 0 45 76
meeting 0 45 76
of 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
commission 0 45 76
to 0 45 76
address 0 45 76
information 0 45 76
that 0 45 76
had 0 45 76
come 0 45 76
into 0 45 76
Warren’s 0 45 76
possession. 0 45 76

That 0 45 77
information 0 45 77
was 0 45 77
that 0 45 77
Oswald 0 45 77
was 0 45 77
actually 0 45 77
working 0 45 77
for 0 45 77
U.S. 0 45 77
intelligence. 0 45 77

Yes, 0 45 78
a 0 45 78
spy, 0 45 78
the 0 45 78
type 0 45 78
of 0 45 78
people 0 45 78
that 0 45 78
work 0 45 78
for 0 45 78
the 0 45 78
CIA. 0 45 78

That 0 45 79
would 0 45 79
make 0 45 79
sense, 0 45 79
especially 0 45 79
given 0 45 79
that 0 45 79
the 0 45 79
Marine 0 45 79
Corps 0 45 79
is 0 45 79
a 0 45 79
prime 0 45 79
recruiting 0 45 79
place 0 45 79
for 0 45 79
the 0 45 79
CIA. 0 45 79

Semper 0 45 80
fidelis! 0 45 80

Now, 0 45 81
suddenly, 0 45 81
all 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
circumstantial 0 45 81
evidence 0 45 81
in 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
Kennedy 0 45 81
assassination 0 45 81
falls 0 45 81
into 0 45 81
place. 0 45 81

It 0 45 82
begins 0 45 82
to 0 45 82
make 0 45 82
sense. 0 45 82

The 0 45 83
mosaic 0 45 83
starts 0 45 83
to 0 45 83
be 0 45 83
filled 0 45 83
out: 0 45 83
They 1 45 83
needed 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
get 1 45 83
rid 1 45 83
of 1 45 83
Kennedy 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
protect 1 45 83
national 1 45 83
security 1 45 83
and 1 45 83
elevate 1 45 83
Johnson, 1 45 83
who 1 45 83
had 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
same 1 45 83
anti-communist 1 45 83
mindset 1 45 83
as 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
Pentagon 1 45 83
and 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
CIA, 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
presidency. 1 45 83

Unlike 0 45 84
JFK, 0 45 84
who 0 45 84
had 0 45 84
begun 0 45 84
withdrawing 0 45 84
troops 0 45 84
from 0 45 84
Vietnam, 0 45 84
Johnson 0 45 84
would 0 45 84

protect 0 45 85
national 0 45 85
security 0 45 85
by 0 45 85
sending 0 45 85
more 0 45 85
troops 0 45 85
to 0 45 85
Vietnam. 0 45 85

But 0 45 86
to 0 45 86
avoid 0 45 86
detection, 0 45 86
they 0 45 86
needed 0 45 86
a 0 45 86
patsy, 0 45 86
which 0 45 86
is 0 45 86
the 0 45 86
term 0 45 86
that 0 45 86
Oswald 0 45 86
used 0 45 86
after 0 45 86
his 0 45 86
arrest. 0 45 86

They 0 45 87
needed 0 45 87
to 0 45 87
frame 0 45 87
someone 0 45 87
for 0 45 87
the 0 45 87
crime. 0 45 87

And 0 45 88
what 0 45 88
better 0 45 88
person 0 45 88
to 0 45 88
frame 0 45 88
than 0 45 88
a 0 45 88
communist 0 45 88
or 0 45 88
an 0 45 88
intelligence 0 45 88
agent 0 45 88
who 0 45 88
the 0 45 88
public 0 45 88
would 0 45 88
believe 0 45 88
was 0 45 88
a 0 45 88
communist? 0 45 88

Part 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
scheme, 0 45 89
obviously, 0 45 89
would 0 45 89
be 0 45 89
to 0 45 89
establish 0 45 89
Oswald’s 0 45 89
communist 0 45 89
bona 0 45 89
fides. 0 45 89

That’s 0 45 90
why 0 45 90
he 0 45 90
was 0 45 90
sent 0 45 90
to 0 45 90
New 0 45 90
Orleans, 0 45 90
where, 0 45 90
contradictorily, 0 45 90
he 0 45 90
would 0 45 90
work 0 45 90
for 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
right-wing 0 45 90
business 0 45 90
owner, 0 45 90
work 0 45 90
with 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
right-wing 0 45 90
former 0 45 90
FBI 0 45 90
agent, 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
conduct 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
public 0 45 90
protest 0 45 90
in 0 45 90
favor 0 45 90
of 0 45 90
Fidel 0 45 90
Castro 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
Cuba. 0 45 90

It 0 45 91
was 0 45 91
also 0 45 91
why 0 45 91
he 0 45 91
was 0 45 91
sent 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
Mexico 0 45 91
City, 0 45 91
where 0 45 91
he 0 45 91
would 0 45 91
be 0 45 91
ordered 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
visit 0 45 91
the 0 45 91
Cuban 0 45 91
and 0 45 91
Soviet 0 45 91
Embassies, 0 45 91
no 1 45 91
doubt 1 45 91
being 1 45 91
told 1 45 91
that 1 45 91
he 1 45 91
was 1 45 91
being 1 45 91
prepared 1 45 91
for 1 45 91
an 1 45 91
important 1 45 91
mission, 1 45 91
maybe 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
enter 0 45 91
Cuba 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
assassinate 0 45 91
Castro. 0 45 91

But 0 45 92
no 1 45 92
government 1 45 92
operation 1 45 92
ever 1 45 92
goes 1 45 92
perfectly. 1 45 92

Things 0 45 93
obviously 0 45 93
went 0 45 93
dreadfully 1 45 93
wrong 1 45 93
with 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
Mexico 0 45 93
City 0 45 93
operation 0 45 93
because 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
investigation 0 45 93
into 0 45 93
it 0 45 93
after 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
assassination 0 45 93
was 0 45 93
quickly 0 45 93
shut 0 45 93
down. 0 45 93

Today, 0 45 94
it 0 45 94
remains 0 45 94
shrouded 1 45 94
in 1 45 94
mystery. 1 45 94

And 0 45 95
guess 0 45 95
what 0 45 95
is 0 45 95
included 0 45 95
in 0 45 95
the 0 45 95
records 0 45 95
that 0 45 95
Trump 0 45 95
has 0 45 95
now 0 45 95
agreed 0 45 95
to 0 45 95
continue 0 45 95
suppressing. 0 45 95

You 0 45 96
guessed 0 45 96
it! 0 45 96

The 0 45 97
CIA’s 0 45 97
records 0 45 97
relating 0 45 97
to 0 45 97
Mexico 0 45 97
City! 0 45 97

Ever 0 45 98
since 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
assassination, 0 45 98
the 1 45 98
CIA 1 45 98
has 1 45 98
argued 1 45 98
that 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
release 1 45 98
of 1 45 98
any 1 45 98
of 1 45 98
its 1 45 98
JFK 1 45 98
records 1 45 98
would 1 45 98
threaten 1 45 98
“national 1 45 98
security.” 1 45 98
One 0 45 98
thing 0 45 98
is 0 45 98
for 0 45 98
sure 0 45 98
and 0 45 98
undeniable: 0 45 98
Despite 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
release 0 45 98
of 0 45 98
many 0 45 98
of 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
CIA’s 0 45 98
records 0 45 98
in 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
1990s 0 45 98
and 0 45 98
yesterday, 0 45 98
the 1 45 98
United 1 45 98
States 1 45 98
did 1 45 98
not 1 45 98
fall 1 45 98
into 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
ocean 1 45 98
or 1 45 98
fall 1 45 98
to 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
communists. 1 45 98

And 0 45 99
neither 0 45 99
would 0 45 99
it 0 45 99
have 0 45 99
done 0 45 99
so 0 45 99
if 0 45 99
Trump 0 45 99
had 0 45 99
not 0 45 99
granted 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
CIA’s 0 45 99
request 0 45 99
for 0 45 99
a 0 45 99
continued 0 45 99
cover-up 0 45 99
of 0 45 99
what 0 45 99
it 0 45 99
did 0 45 99
on 0 45 99
