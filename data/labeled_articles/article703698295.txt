a 0 52 5

made 0 52 5
public 0 52 5
November 0 52 5
1st, 0 52 5
Fr. 0 52 5

Weinandy, 0 52 6
a 0 52 6
former 0 52 6
chief 0 52 6
of 0 52 6
staff 0 52 6
for 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
U.S. 0 52 6
Bishops’ 0 52 6
Committee 0 52 6
on 0 52 6
Doctrine 0 52 6
and 0 52 6
a 0 52 6
member 0 52 6
of 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
Vatican’s 0 52 6
International 0 52 6
Theological 0 52 6
Commission, 0 52 6
warned 0 52 6
Pope 0 52 6
Francis 0 52 6
that 0 52 6
he 0 52 6
has 0 52 6
caused 0 52 6
“chronic 0 52 6
confusion” 0 52 6
among 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
faithful 0 52 6
and 0 52 6
bishops. 0 52 6

He 0 52 7
wrote 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
the 0 52 7
pope, 0 52 7
“To 1 52 7
teach 1 52 7
with 1 52 7
such 1 52 7
an 1 52 7
intentional 1 52 7
lack 1 52 7
of 1 52 7
clarity 1 52 7
inevitably 1 52 7
risks 1 52 7
sinning 1 52 7
against 1 52 7
the 1 52 7
Holy 1 52 7
Spirit, 1 52 7
the 1 52 7
Spirit 1 52 7
of 1 52 7
truth.” 1 52 7
He 0 52 7
added 0 52 7
that 0 52 7
Catholics 0 52 7
are 0 52 7
“disconcerted” 0 52 7
by 0 52 7
the 0 52 7
appointment 0 52 7
of 0 52 7
bishops 0 52 7
“who 0 52 7
seem 0 52 7
not 0 52 7
merely 0 52 7
open 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
those 0 52 7
who 0 52 7
hold 0 52 7
views 0 52 7
counter 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
Christian 0 52 7
belief, 0 52 7
but 0 52 7
who 0 52 7
support 0 52 7
and 0 52 7
even 0 52 7
defend 0 52 7
them.” 0 52 7

In 0 52 8
an 0 52 8
interview 0 52 8
yesterday 0 52 8
with 0 52 8
John 0 52 8
Allen’s 0 52 8
Crux, 0 52 8
he 0 52 8
added, 0 52 8
more 0 52 8
prophetically 0 52 8
than 0 52 8
he 0 52 8
had 0 52 8
perhaps 0 52 8
intended, 0 52 8
“I 0 52 8
don’t 0 52 8
think 0 52 8
anyone 0 52 8
can, 0 52 8
or 0 52 8
should, 0 52 8
associate 0 52 8
my 0 52 8
letter 0 52 8
with 0 52 8
the 0 52 8
USCCB 0 52 8
or 0 52 8
the 0 52 8
American 0 52 8
bishops. 0 52 8

Neither 0 52 9
was 0 52 9
involved 0 52 9
in 0 52 9
my 0 52 9
writing 0 52 9
the 0 52 9
letter, 0 52 9
and 0 52 9
its 0 52 9
publication 0 52 9
will 0 52 9
be 0 52 9
news 0 52 9
to 0 52 9

them.” 0 52 10
“Bishops 0 52 10
are 0 52 10
quick 0 52 10
learners,” 0 52 10
he 0 52 10
wrote 0 52 10
in 0 52 10
his 0 52 10
letter, 0 52 10
“and 0 52 10
what 0 52 10
many 0 52 10
have 0 52 10
learned 0 52 10
from 0 52 10
your 0 52 10
pontificate 0 52 10
is 0 52 10
not 0 52 10
that 0 52 10
you 0 52 10
are 0 52 10
open 0 52 10
to 0 52 10
criticism, 0 52 10
but 0 52 10
that 0 52 10
you 0 52 10
resent 0 52 10
it,” 0 52 10
claiming 0 52 10
that 0 52 10
many 0 52 10
bishops 0 52 10
don’t 1 52 10
speak 1 52 10
out 1 52 10
publicly 1 52 10
for 1 52 10
fear 1 52 10
they 1 52 10
will 1 52 10
be 1 52 10
“marginalized 1 52 10
or 1 52 10

worse.” 1 52 11
And 0 52 11
sure 0 52 11
enough, 0 52 11
within 0 52 11
hours 0 52 11
of 0 52 11
making 0 52 11
his 0 52 11
letter 0 52 11
public, 0 52 11
we 0 52 11
learned 0 52 11

that 0 52 12
Fr. 0 52 12
Weinandy 0 52 12
had 0 52 12
been 0 52 12
given 1 52 12

the 1 52 13
boot. 1 52 13
Of 0 52 13
course, 0 52 13
the 0 52 13
Twitterverse 0 52 13
is 0 52 13
busy 0 52 13
commenting 0 52 13
on 0 52 13
the 0 52 13
irony: 0 52 13
how 0 52 13
a 0 52 13
man 0 52 13
expressing 0 52 13
grave 0 52 13
concerns 0 52 13
that 0 52 13
there 0 52 13
is 0 52 13
an 0 52 13
atmosphere 0 52 13
of 0 52 13
fear 0 52 13
of 0 52 13
being 0 52 13
punished 0 52 13
for 0 52 13
expressing 0 52 13
grave 0 52 13
concerns, 0 52 13
was 0 52 13
immediately 0 52 13

fired. 0 52 14
Perhaps 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
most 0 52 14
astonishing 0 52 14
aspect 0 52 14
of 0 52 14
this 0 52 14
little 1 52 14
incident 1 52 14
is 0 52 14
just 0 52 14
how 0 52 14
completely 0 52 14
blind 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
US 0 52 14
bishops 0 52 14
– 0 52 14
as 0 52 14
with 0 52 14
nearly 0 52 14
all 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
episcopate 0 52 14
– 0 52 14
are 0 52 14
to 0 52 14
what 0 52 14
political 0 52 14
analysts 0 52 14
call 0 52 14

the 0 52 15
“optics”. 0 52 15
Political 0 52 15
consultants 0 52 15
often 0 52 15
ask: 0 52 15
how 0 52 15

does 0 52 16
it 0 52 16
look? 0 52 16
And 0 52 16
it 0 52 16
looks 0 52 16

extremely 1 52 17
bad. 1 52 17
As 0 52 17
though 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
fog 0 52 17
of 0 52 17
irony 0 52 17
weren’t 0 52 17
thick 0 52 17
enough, 0 52 17
in 0 52 17
response 0 52 17
to 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
outrage 0 52 17
from 0 52 17
Catholics, 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
USCCB 0 52 17
has 0 52 17
done 0 52 17
what 0 52 17
all 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
other 0 52 17
members 0 52 17
of 0 52 17
Pope 0 52 17
Francis’ 0 52 17
cabal 0 52 17
have 0 52 17
done 0 52 17
and 0 52 17
started 0 52 17
blocking 0 52 17
critics 0 52 17
from 0 52 17
its 0 52 17
Twitter 0 52 17

account. 0 52 18
Which, 0 52 18
it 0 52 18
must 0 52 18
be 0 52 18
said, 0 52 18

only 0 52 19
proves 0 52 19
Fr. 0 52 19
Weinandy’s 0 52 19
point 0 52 19

once 0 52 20
again. 0 52 20
Some 0 52 20
of 0 52 20
the 0 52 20
criticism 0 52 20
has 0 52 20
been 0 52 20

unusually 0 52 21

sharp. 0 52 22
Fr. 0 52 22
Hunwicke 0 52 22
wrote 0 52 22
this 0 52 22
afternoon, 0 52 22
“This 0 52 22
cheap 1 52 22

has, 0 52 23
in 0 52 23

just 0 52 24
said.” 0 52 24
As 0 52 24
I 0 52 24
write 0 52 24
this, 0 52 24
the 0 52 24
outrage 0 52 24
is 0 52 24
doing 0 52 24
the 0 52 24
opposite 0 52 24
of 0 52 24
dying 0 52 24
down, 0 52 24
and 0 52 24
is 0 52 24
surely 0 52 24
a 0 52 24
sign 0 52 24
of 0 52 24
how 0 52 24
fed 0 52 24
up 0 52 24
Catholics 0 52 24
– 0 52 24
even 0 52 24
those 0 52 24
who 0 52 24
would 0 52 24
never 0 52 24
identify 0 52 24
themselves 0 52 24
as 0 52 24
Traditionalists 0 52 24
– 0 52 24
have 0 52 24
become 0 52 24
with 0 52 24
this 0 52 24
pope 0 52 24
and 0 52 24
his 0 52 24
cadre 0 52 24

of 0 52 25
episcopal 1 52 25
bullies. 1 52 25

In 0 52 26
his 0 52 26
letter, 0 52 26
Fr. 0 52 26
Weinandy 0 52 26
made 0 52 26
a 0 52 26
point 0 52 26
of 0 52 26
stating 0 52 26
that 0 52 26
he 0 52 26

Pope 0 52 27

In 0 52 27
fact, 0 52 27
a 0 52 27
former 0 52 27
student 0 52 27
of 0 52 27
his 0 52 27

to 0 52 28
me 0 52 28
today 0 52 28

saying, 0 52 29
“I 0 52 29

that 0 52 29
Fr. 0 52 29
Thomas 0 52 29
Weinandy 0 52 29

has 0 52 30
been 0 52 30
squashed. 0 52 30
He 0 52 30
was 0 52 30
one 0 52 30
of 0 52 30
my 0 52 30
professors 0 52 30

Patristics 0 52 30
at 0 52 30

was 0 52 30
one 0 52 30
of 0 52 30
the 0 52 30
most 0 52 30
mild-mannered, 0 52 30

kindest 0 52 30

the 0 52 31
crisis 0 52 31

the 0 52 31
church 0 52 31
and 0 52 31
the 0 52 31
papacy 0 52 31

is 0 52 32
very 0 52 32
significant. 0 52 32
He 0 52 32
is 0 52 32
neither 0 52 32
a 0 52 32
traditionalist, 0 52 32
nor 0 52 32

a 0 52 32
humble 0 52 32

to 0 52 32
the 0 52 32

Church 0 52 33
and 0 52 33
Her 0 52 33
teaching. 0 52 33
I 0 52 33
would 0 52 33
be 0 52 33
surprised 0 52 33
now 0 52 33
if 0 52 33
we 0 52 33

that 0 52 34
it’s 0 52 34
going 0 52 34
to 0 52 34

harder 0 52 34

this 0 52 35

point 0 52 38
list 0 52 38
of 0 52 38

Fr. 0 52 39
Weinandy’s 0 52 39
concerns. 0 52 39

He 0 52 40
said 0 52 40
the 0 52 40
pope 0 52 40
is… 0 52 40
Fostering 0 52 40

“chronic 0 52 41
confusion.” 0 52 41
“Demeaning” 0 52 41
the 0 52 41

importance 0 52 42
of 0 52 42
doctrine. 0 52 42
Appointing 0 52 42
bishops 0 52 42
who 1 52 42
“scandalize” 1 52 42
believers 1 52 42
with 0 52 42
dubious 0 52 42
“teaching 0 52 42

and 0 52 43
pastoral 0 52 43
practice.” 0 52 43
Giving 0 52 43
prelates 0 52 43
who 0 52 43
object 0 52 43
the 0 52 43
impression 0 52 43
they’ll 1 52 43
be 1 52 43
“marginalized 1 52 43
or 1 52 43

worse” 1 52 44
if 1 52 44
they 1 52 44
speak 1 52 44
out. 1 52 44
Causing 0 52 44
faithful 0 52 44
Catholics 0 52 44
to 0 52 44
“lose 0 52 44
confidence 0 52 44
in 0 52 44

their 0 52 45
supreme 1 52 45
shepherd.” 1 52 45
Our 0 52 45
friend 0 52 45
Edward 0 52 45
Pentin 0 52 45
has 0 52 45
reproduced 0 52 45
the 0 52 45
full 0 52 45
text 0 52 45
of 0 52 45
the 0 52 45
letter 0 52 45
at 0 52 45
the 0 52 45
National 0 52 45
Catholic 0 52 45
Register 0 52 45
which 0 52 45
is 0 52 45

definitely 0 52 46

worth 0 52 47
a 0 52 47
read. 0 52 47
Fr. 0 52 47
Weinandy 0 52 47
sent 0 52 47
the 0 52 47
letter 0 52 47
to 0 52 47
the 0 52 47
pope 0 52 47
on 0 52 47
July 0 52 47
31, 0 52 47
the 0 52 47
Feast 0 52 47

of 0 52 48
St. 0 52 48
Ignatius 0 52 48
of 0 52 48
Loyola. 0 52 48
Like 0 52 48
the 0 52 48
Dubia 0 52 48
cardinals, 0 52 48
he 0 52 48
said 0 52 48
he 0 52 48
made 0 52 48
it 0 52 48
public 0 52 48
only 0 52 48
after 0 52 48
the 0 52 48
pope 0 52 48

had 0 52 49
ignored 0 52 49
it 0 52 49
for 0 52 49
months. 0 52 49
Notable 0 52 49
in 0 52 49
his 0 52 49
critique 0 52 49
is 0 52 49
its 0 52 49
distinct 0 52 49
pastoral 0 52 49
flavour, 0 52 49
his 0 52 49
concern 0 52 49
on 0 52 49
the 0 52 49
effect 0 52 49
the 0 52 49
situation 0 52 49
is 0 52 49

having 0 52 50
on 0 52 50
ordinary 0 52 50
people. 0 52 50
The 0 52 50
pope, 0 52 50
he 0 52 50
said, 0 52 50
seems 0 52 50
“to 0 52 50
censor 0 52 50
and 0 52 50
even 0 52 50
mock” 0 52 50
critics 0 52 50
of 0 52 50
Amoris 0 52 50
Laetitia 0 52 50
for 0 52 50
their 0 52 50
desire 0 52 50
to 0 52 50
interpret 0 52 50
it 0 52 50
in 0 52 50
keeping 0 52 50
with 0 52 50
Catholic 0 52 50
teaching, 0 52 50
and 0 52 50
in 0 52 50
doing 0 52 50
so 0 52 50
is 0 52 50
committing 0 52 50
a 0 52 50
“kind 0 52 50
of 0 52 50
calumny…alien 0 52 50
to 0 52 50
the 0 52 50
nature 0 52 50

of 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
Petrine 0 52 51
ministry.” 0 52 51
In 0 52 51
an 0 52 51
interview 0 52 51
with 0 52 51
Crux, 0 52 51
Weinandy 0 52 51
said 0 52 51
he 0 52 51
is 0 52 51
not 0 52 51
afraid 0 52 51
of 0 52 51
reprisals 0 52 51
but 0 52 51
“more 0 52 51
concerned 0 52 51
about 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
good 0 52 51
that 0 52 51
my 0 52 51
letter 0 52 51
might 0 52 51
do.” 0 52 51
The 0 52 51
letter 0 52 51
“expresses 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
concerns 0 52 51
of 0 52 51
many 0 52 51
more 0 52 51
people 0 52 51
than 0 52 51
just 0 52 51
me, 0 52 51
ordinary 0 52 51
people 0 52 51
who’ve 0 52 51
come 0 52 51
to 0 52 51
me 0 52 51
with 0 52 51
their 0 52 51

questions 0 52 52
and 0 52 52
apprehensions. 0 52 52
I 0 52 52
wanted 0 52 52
them 0 52 52

to 0 52 53
know 0 52 53
that 0 52 53
I 0 52 53
listened.” 0 52 53
“I 0 52 53
have 1 52 53
done 1 52 53
what 1 52 53
I 1 52 53
believe 1 52 53
God 1 52 53

wanted 1 52 54
me 1 52 54
to 1 52 54

do,[1]” 1 52 55
he 0 52 55
said. 0 52 55
In 0 52 55
fact, 0 52 55
Fr. 0 52 55
Weinandy 0 52 55
has 0 52 55
bolstered 1 52 55
my 1 52 55
own 1 52 55
“Great 1 52 55
Clarifier” 1 52 55
theory, 1 52 55
saying 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
this 0 52 55
pontificate, 0 52 55
and 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
lack 0 52 55
of 0 52 55
response 0 52 55
to 0 52 55
it 0 52 55
from 0 52 55
priests 0 52 55
and 0 52 55
bishops, 0 52 55
is 0 52 55
being 0 52 55
allowed 0 52 55
by 0 52 55
God 0 52 55
in 0 52 55
order 0 52 55
to 0 52 55
reveal 0 52 55
“just 0 52 55
how 0 52 55
weak 0 52 55
is 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
faith 0 52 55
of 0 52 55
many 0 52 55
within 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
Church,” 0 52 55
He 0 52 55
added 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
Francis 0 52 55
has 0 52 55
revealed 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
many 0 52 55
in 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
Church 0 52 55
“hold 0 52 55
harmful 0 52 55
theological 0 52 55

and 0 52 56
pastoral 0 52 56
views.” 0 52 56
Which 0 52 56
inevitably 0 52 56
brings 0 52 56
to 0 52 56
mind 0 52 56
other 0 52 56
responses 0 52 56
that 0 52 56
have 0 52 56
not 0 52 56
been 0 52 56
quite 0 52 56

so 0 52 57
clear, 0 52 57
nor 0 52 57
so 0 52 57
pastoral. 0 52 57
When 0 52 57
Cardinal 0 52 57
Muller 0 52 57
was 0 52 57
removed 0 52 57
abruptly 0 52 57
from 0 52 57
his 0 52 57
position 0 52 57
as 0 52 57
head 0 52 57
of 0 52 57
the 0 52 57
CDF, 0 52 57
the 0 52 57
conservative 0 52 57
Catholic 0 52 57
world 0 52 57
wailed 0 52 57
that 0 52 57
it 0 52 57
was 0 52 57
another 0 52 57
case 0 52 57
of 0 52 57
a 0 52 57

“good” 0 52 58
prelate 0 52 58
being 0 52 58
got 0 52 58
rid 0 52 58
of. 0 52 58
And 0 52 58
it 0 52 58
seems 0 52 58
clear 0 52 58
from 0 52 58
the 0 52 58
way 0 52 58
it 0 52 58
was 0 52 58
done, 0 52 58
and 0 52 58
the 0 52 58
way 0 52 58
Francis 0 52 58
treated 0 52 58
Muller 0 52 58
in 0 52 58
general, 0 52 58

that 0 52 59
he 0 52 59
was 0 52 59
indeed 0 52 59
got 1 52 59
rid 1 52 59
of. 1 52 59
But 0 52 59
his 0 52 59
depiction 0 52 59
by 0 52 59
conservative 0 52 59
writers 0 52 59
as 0 52 59
a 0 52 59
beleaguered 0 52 59
champion 0 52 59
of 0 52 59
Catholic 0 52 59
orthodoxy 0 52 59
persecuted 0 52 59
by 0 52 59
the 0 52 59
regime 0 52 59
for 0 52 59
his 0 52 59
faithfulness 0 52 59
betrays 0 52 59
a 0 52 59
somewhat 0 52 59
selective 0 52 59

memory 0 52 60
and 0 52 60
short 0 52 60
attention 0 52 60
span. 0 52 60
Ed 0 52 60
Pentin 0 52 60
has 0 52 60
a 0 52 60
long 0 52 60
file 0 52 60
of 0 52 60
interviews 0 52 60
and 0 52 60
articles 0 52 60
about 0 52 60
Muller 0 52 60
that 0 52 60
clearly 0 52 60
show 0 52 60
his 0 52 60
complete 0 52 60
inability 0 52 60
to 0 52 60
make 0 52 60

up 0 52 61
his 0 52 61
mind 0 52 61
whose 0 52 61
side 0 52 61
he’s 0 52 61
on. 0 52 61
A 0 52 61
quick 0 52 61
examination 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
Muller’s 0 52 61
interviews 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
statements 0 52 61
reveal 0 52 61
an 0 52 61
irresolute 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
ultimately 0 52 61
calculating 0 52 61
mind 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
a 0 52 61
man 0 52 61
who 0 52 61
is 0 52 61
– 0 52 61
so 0 52 61
I 0 52 61
am 0 52 61
told 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
sources 0 52 61
close 0 52 61
to 0 52 61
him 0 52 61
– 0 52 61
motivated 0 52 61
mainly 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
a 0 52 61
puerile 0 52 61
desire 0 52 61
to 0 52 61
be 0 52 61
approved 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
the 1 52 61
“cool 1 52 61
kids” 1 52 61
in 1 52 61
the 1 52 61
Vatican, 1 52 61
on 0 52 61
the 0 52 61
one 0 52 61
hand, 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
an 0 52 61
unshakeable 0 52 61
conviction 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
his 0 52 61
own 0 52 61
theological 0 52 61

brilliance 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
other. 0 52 62
Most 0 52 62
recently, 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
October 0 52 62
30th, 0 52 62
Crux 0 52 62
quoted 0 52 62
him 0 52 62
under 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
headline, 0 52 62
“Cardinal 0 52 62
Muller 0 52 62
backs 0 52 62
Pope 0 52 62
Francis 0 52 62
against 0 52 62
critics 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
‘Amoris 0 52 62
Laetitia’” 0 52 62
in 0 52 62
which 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
former 0 52 62
head 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
CDF 0 52 62
has 0 52 62
at 0 52 62
last 0 52 62
climbed 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
board 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
Kasperian 0 52 62
train 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
reception 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
Communion 0 52 62

for 0 52 63
unrepentant 0 52 63
adulterers. 0 52 63
Signaling 1 52 63
furiously 1 52 63
with 0 52 63
the 0 52 63
trendy 0 52 63
FrancisChurch 0 52 63
buzzwords 0 52 63
and 0 52 63
even 0 52 63
trendier 0 52 63
blithering 1 52 63
incoherence, 1 52 63
Muller 0 52 63
writes 0 52 63
that 0 52 63
“mitigating 0 52 63
factors 0 52 63
in 0 52 63
guilt,” 0 52 63
can 0 52 63
lead, 0 52 63
couples 0 52 63
in 0 52 63
“an 0 52 63
uncertain 0 52 63
marital 0 52 63
situation” 0 52 63
through 0 52 63
a 0 52 63
“path 0 52 63
of 0 52 63
repentance” 0 52 63
– 0 52 63
always 0 52 63
“accompanied” 0 52 63
by 0 52 63
an 0 52 63
exquisitely 0 52 63
sensitive 0 52 63
confessor 0 52 63
– 0 52 63
to 0 52 63
a 0 52 63
point 0 52 63
where 0 52 63
the 0 52 63
reception 0 52 63

of 0 52 64
Communion 0 52 64
is 0 52 64
no 0 52 64
longer 0 52 64
sinful. 0 52 64
Presumably 1 52 64
because 1 52 64
adultery 1 52 64

itself 1 52 65
is 1 52 65
no 1 52 65
longer 1 52 65
sinful. 1 52 65

Or 0 52 66
sacrilege 0 52 66

either, 0 52 67
I 0 52 67
guess. 0 52 67
Or 0 52 67
something. 0 52 67
Somehow 0 52 67
the 0 52 67
“new 0 52 67
evangelization” 0 52 67
is 0 52 67
involved 0 52 67
in 0 52 67
this, 0 52 67
though 0 52 67
it’s 0 52 67
unclear 0 52 67
how 0 52 67
exactly 0 52 67
it 0 52 67
makes 0 52 67
adultery 0 52 67
and 0 52 67
sacrilege 0 52 67
OK. 0 52 67
Also, 0 52 67
it’s 0 52 67
very 0 52 67
important 0 52 67
to 0 52 67
fulfill 0 52 67
the 0 52 67
Sunday 0 52 67
Mass 0 52 67
obligation, 0 52 67
and 0 52 67
as 0 52 67
everyone 0 52 67
knows, 0 52 67
one 0 52 67
can’t 0 52 67
possibly 0 52 67
go 0 52 67
to 0 52 67
Mass 0 52 67
on 0 52 67
a 0 52 67

Sunday 0 52 68
without 0 52 68
receiving 0 52 68
Communion. 0 52 68
We 0 52 68
hear 0 52 68
again, 0 52 68
as 0 52 68
we 0 52 68
did 0 52 68
incessantly 0 52 68
from 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
Kasperians 0 52 68
at 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
Synods, 0 52 68
about 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
hard 0 52 68
case 0 52 68
of 0 52 68
the 1 52 68
poor, 1 52 68
poor 1 52 68
woman 1 52 68
who 0 52 68
has 0 52 68
been 0 52 68
abandoned 0 52 68
by 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
first 0 52 68
husband, 0 52 68
and 0 52 68
who 0 52 68
“finds 0 52 68
no 0 52 68
other 0 52 68
way 0 52 68
out 0 52 68
than 0 52 68
to 0 52 68
entrust 0 52 68
oneself 0 52 68
to 0 52 68
a 0 52 68
kind-hearted 0 52 68
person,” 0 52 68
… 0 52 68
with 1 52 68
whom, 1 52 68
I 1 52 68
guess, 1 52 68
she 1 52 68
has 1 52 68
also 1 52 68
no 1 52 68

choice 1 52 69
but 1 52 69
to 1 52 69
have 1 52 69
sexual 1 52 69
relations. 1 52 69

Because 1 52 70
of 1 52 70
kind-heartedness. 1 52 70
Anyway, 0 52 70
the 0 52 70
result 0 52 70
of 0 52 70
this 0 52 70
is 0 52 70
a 0 52 70
“marriage-like 0 52 70
relationship” 0 52 70
about 0 52 70
which 0 52 70
confessors 0 52 70
have 0 52 70
to 0 52 70
be 0 52 70

very 0 52 71
careful 0 52 71
not 0 52 71
to 0 52 71

say 0 52 72
mean 0 52 72
things. 0 52 72
Or 0 52 72
be 0 52 72
too 0 52 72
“extreme”. 0 52 72
It’s 0 52 72
very 0 52 72
important 0 52 72
for 0 52 72
him 0 52 72
to 0 52 72
avoid 0 52 72
a 0 52 72
“cheap 0 52 72
adaptation 0 52 72
to 0 52 72
the 0 52 72
relativistic 1 52 72
Zeitgeist,” 1 52 72
on 0 52 72
one 0 52 72
side, 0 52 72
and 0 52 72
a 0 52 72
“cold 0 52 72
application 0 52 72
of 0 52 72
the 0 52 72
dogmatic 0 52 72
commandments 0 52 72
and 0 52 72

the 0 52 73
canonical 0 52 73
rules,” 0 52 73
on 0 52 73
the 0 52 73
other. 0 52 73

Because 0 52 74
that 0 52 74

could 0 52 75
be 0 52 75
too 0 52 75
polarizing. 0 52 75
And 0 52 75
mean. 0 52 75
And 0 52 75
anyway, 0 52 75
sins 0 52 75
of 0 52 75
the 0 52 75

flesh 0 52 76
aren’t 0 52 76
the 0 52 76
worst 0 52 76
things 0 52 76
ever. 0 52 76
There 0 52 76
are, 0 52 76
like, 0 52 76
“different 0 52 76

levels” 0 52 77
of 0 52 77
gravity, 0 52 77
you 0 52 77
know? 0 52 77
And, 0 52 77
like, 0 52 77

it 0 52 78
depends 0 52 78
on 0 52 78
the 0 52 78
type 0 52 78
of 0 52 78
sin, 0 52 78
right? 0 52 78
“Spirit’s 0 52 78
sins” 0 52 78
like 0 52 78
spiritual 0 52 78
pride 0 52 78
and 0 52 78
avarice 0 52 78
and 0 52 78
stuff, 0 52 78
are 0 52 78
worse 0 52 78

than 0 52 79
“sins 0 52 79
of 0 52 79
the 0 52 79
flesh,” 0 52 79
you 0 52 79
know? 0 52 79
Which 0 52 79
are, 0 52 79
like, 0 52 79
only 0 52 79

a 0 52 80
result 0 52 80
of 0 52 80
“human 0 52 80
weakness,” 0 52 80
right? 0 52 80
Apparently 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
real 0 52 80
problem 0 52 80
with 0 52 80
this 0 52 80
whole 0 52 80
thing 0 52 80
has 0 52 80
been 0 52 80
that 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
Kasperian 0 52 80
kerfuffle 0 52 80
has 0 52 80
totally 0 52 80
been 0 52 80
blown 0 52 80
way, 0 52 80
way, 0 52 80
WAY 0 52 80
out 0 52 80
of 0 52 80
proportion, 0 52 80
and 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
“polarization” 0 52 80

it 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
caused 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
been 0 52 81
“regrettable”. 0 52 81
The 0 52 81
question 0 52 81
of 0 52 81
Communion 0 52 81
for 0 52 81
divorced 0 52 81
and 0 52 81
civilly 0 52 81
“remarried” 0 52 81
Catholics, 0 52 81
he 0 52 81
said, 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
been 0 52 81
“falsely 1 52 81
elevated 1 52 81
to 1 52 81
the 1 52 81
rank 1 52 81
of 1 52 81
a 1 52 81
decisive 1 52 81
question 1 52 81
of 1 52 81
Catholicism 1 52 81
and 1 52 81
a 1 52 81
measure 1 52 81
of 1 52 81
ideological 1 52 81
comparison 1 52 81
in 1 52 81
order 1 52 81
to 1 52 81
decide 1 52 81
whether 1 52 81
one 1 52 81
is 1 52 81
conservative 1 52 81
or 1 52 81

liberal, 1 52 82
in 1 52 82
favor 1 52 82
or 1 52 82
against 1 52 82
the 1 52 82
pope.” 1 52 82
For 0 52 82
years 0 52 82
under 0 52 82
Pope 0 52 82
Benedict, 0 52 82
Muller 0 52 82
was 0 52 82
engaged 0 52 82
in 0 52 82
an 0 52 82
open 0 52 82
war 0 52 82
with 0 52 82
the 0 52 82
German 0 52 82
episcopate 0 52 82
who 0 52 82
insisted 0 52 82
that 0 52 82
they 0 52 82
were 0 52 82
going 0 52 82
to 0 52 82
allow 0 52 82
Communion 0 52 82
for 0 52 82
the 0 52 82
divorced 0 52 82
and 0 52 82
remarried, 0 52 82
no 0 52 82
matter 0 52 82
what 0 52 82
Rome 0 52 82
said, 0 52 82
even 1 52 82
threatening 1 52 82
to 1 52 82
go 1 52 82
into 1 52 82

schism 1 52 83
if 1 52 83
they 1 52 83
didn’t 1 52 83
get 1 52 83
their 1 52 83
way[2]. 0 52 83
Muller, 0 52 83
with 0 52 83
little 0 52 83
backing 0 52 83
from 0 52 83
Pope 0 52 83
Benedict 0 52 83
– 0 52 83
who 0 52 83
appeared 0 52 83
content 0 52 83
to 0 52 83
allow 0 52 83
his 0 52 83
CDF 0 52 83
prefect 0 52 83
and 0 52 83
the 0 52 83
Germans 0 52 83
shout 0 52 83
out 0 52 83
their 0 52 83
differences 0 52 83
– 0 52 83
and 0 52 83
with 0 52 83
outright 0 52 83
opposition 0 52 83
from 0 52 83
Francis, 0 52 83

did 0 52 84
indeed 0 52 84
strive 0 52 84
to 0 52 84
hold 0 52 84
the 0 52 84
line. 0 52 84
The 0 52 84
fact 0 52 84
that 0 52 84
Francis 0 52 84
orchestrated 0 52 84
the 0 52 84
Synods 0 52 84
to 0 52 84
undermine 0 52 84

him 0 52 85
was 0 52 85
certainly 0 52 85
not 0 52 85
his 0 52 85
fault. 0 52 85
And 0 52 85
it 0 52 85
is 0 52 85
difficult 0 52 85
to 0 52 85
imagine 0 52 85
anyone 0 52 85
being 0 52 85
in 0 52 85

a 0 52 86
worse 0 52 86
position 0 52 86
than 0 52 86
he 0 52 86
was 0 52 86
at 0 52 86
the 0 52 86
time. 0 52 86
But 0 52 86
since 0 52 86
then, 0 52 86
Muller 0 52 86
has 0 52 86
demonstrated 0 52 86
very 0 52 86
little 0 52 86
of 0 52 86
his 0 52 86
former 0 52 86
grit, 0 52 86
instead 0 52 86
attempting 0 52 86
from 0 52 86

one 0 52 87
day 0 52 87
to 0 52 87
the 0 52 87
next 0 52 87
to 0 52 87
appease 0 52 87
both 0 52 87
sides. 0 52 87
Reportedly 0 52 87
removed 0 52 87
from 0 52 87
CDF 0 52 87
– 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
of 0 52 87
course 0 52 87
lionized 1 52 87
by 0 52 87
“conservatives” 0 52 87
– 0 52 87
for 0 52 87
his 0 52 87
mild 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
equivocating 0 52 87
opposition 0 52 87
to 0 52 87
Amoris 0 52 87
Laetitia, 0 52 87
Muller 0 52 87
has 0 52 87
gone 0 52 87
back 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
forth 0 52 87
in 0 52 87
what 0 52 87
can 0 52 87
easily 0 52 87
be 0 52 87
seen 0 52 87
as 0 52 87
a 0 52 87
desperate 0 52 87

attempt 0 52 88
to 0 52 88
find 0 52 88
friends 0 52 88
in 0 52 88
both 0 52 88
camps. 0 52 88
With 0 52 88
this 0 52 88
in 0 52 88
mind 0 52 88
one 0 52 88
could 0 52 88
be 0 52 88
forgiven 0 52 88
for 0 52 88
not 0 52 88
taking 0 52 88

his 0 52 89
October 0 52 89
30th 0 52 89
essay 0 52 89
too 0 52 89
seriously. 0 52 89
Perhaps 0 52 89

one 0 52 90
of 0 52 90
the 0 52 90
good 0 52 90
effects 0 52 90

a 0 52 90
pastor 0 52 90

of 0 52 91
the 0 52 91
Catholic 0 52 91
Church 0 52 91
is 0 52 91
supposed 0 52 91
to 0 52 91
act. 0 52 91
As 0 52 91
my 0 52 91
friend 0 52 91
said, 0 52 91
maybe 0 52 91
“it’s 0 52 91
going 0 52 91
to 0 52 91
become 0 52 91
harder 0 52 91

harder 0 52 91
for 0 52 91

of 0 52 91
conscience 0 52 91
and 0 52 91
position 0 52 91

In 0 52 95
this 0 52 95
interview, 0 52 95
Fr. 0 52 95
Weinandy 0 52 95
gave 0 52 95
a 0 52 95
remarkable 0 52 95
story 0 52 95
of 0 52 95
how 0 52 95
his 0 52 95
prayer 0 52 95
for 0 52 95
a 0 52 95
“sign” 0 52 95
that 0 52 95
he 0 52 95
ought 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
write 0 52 95
the 0 52 95
letter 0 52 95
was 0 52 95
very 0 52 95
specifically 0 52 95
answered: 0 52 95
“If 0 52 95
you 0 52 95
want 0 52 95
me 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
write 0 52 95
something, 0 52 95
you 0 52 95
have 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
give 0 52 95

me 0 52 96
a 0 52 96
clear 0 52 96
sign,” 0 52 96
Weinandy 0 52 96
recalls 0 52 96
saying. 0 52 96
“Tomorrow 0 52 96
morning, 0 52 96
I’m 0 52 96
going 0 52 96
to 0 52 96
Saint 0 52 96
Mary 0 52 96
Major’s 0 52 96
to 0 52 96
pray, 0 52 96

and 0 52 97
then 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
am 0 52 97
going 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
Saint 0 52 97
John 0 52 97
Lateran. 0 52 97
After 0 52 97
that, 0 52 97
I’m 0 52 97
coming 0 52 97
back 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
Saint 0 52 97
Peter’s 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
have 0 52 97
lunch 0 52 97
with 0 52 97
a 0 52 97
seminary 0 52 97
friend 0 52 97
of 0 52 97
mine.” 0 52 97
“During 0 52 97
that 0 52 97
interval, 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
must 0 52 97
meet 0 52 97
someone 0 52 97
that 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
know 0 52 97
but 0 52 97
have 0 52 97
not 0 52 97
seen 0 52 97
in 0 52 97
a 0 52 97
very 0 52 97
long 0 52 97
time, 0 52 97
and 0 52 97
would 0 52 97

never 0 52 98
expect 0 52 98
to 0 52 98
see 0 52 98
in 0 52 98
Rome 0 52 98
at 0 52 98
this 0 52 98
time. 0 52 98
That 0 52 98
person 0 52 98
cannot 0 52 98
be 0 52 98
from 0 52 98

the 0 52 99
United 0 52 99
States, 0 52 99
Canada 0 52 99
or 0 52 99
Great 0 52 99
Britain. 0 52 99
Moreover, 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
person 0 52 99
has 0 52 99
to 0 52 99
say 0 52 99
to 0 52 99
me, 0 52 99
‘Keep 0 52 99
up 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
good 0 52 99
writing’.” 0 52 99
Weinandy 0 52 99
said, 0 52 99
exactly 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
happened 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
next 0 52 99
day, 0 52 99
in 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
chance 0 52 99
meeting 0 52 99
with 0 52 99
an 0 52 99
archbishop 0 52 99
he’d 0 52 99
known 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
long 0 52 99
time 0 52 99
ago 0 52 99
but 0 52 99
not 0 52 99
seen 0 52 99
for 0 52 99
over 0 52 99
twenty 0 52 99
years, 0 52 99
who 0 52 99
congratulated 0 52 99
him 0 52 99
for 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
book 0 52 99
on 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
Incarnation 0 52 99
and 0 52 99
then 0 52 99
said 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
right 0 52 99
words, 0 52 99
“Keep 0 52 99
up 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
good 0 52 99
writing.” 0 52 99
“There 0 52 99
was 0 52 99
no 0 52 99
longer 0 52 99
any 0 52 99
doubt 0 52 99
in 0 52 99
my 0 52 99
mind 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
Jesus 0 52 99
wanted 0 52 99

me 0 52 99

to 0 52 99

write 0 52 99

something,” 0 52 99

Weinandy 0 52 99

said. 0 52 99

[2] 0 52 99

It’s 0 52 99

notable 0 52 99

that 0 52 99

these 0 52 99

howling 1 52 99

tantrums 1 52 99

from 0 52 99

the 0 52 99

German 0 52 99

bishops 0 52 99

halted 0 52 99

abruptly 0 52 99

about 0 52 99

the 0 52 99

same 0 52 99

time 0 52 99

as 0 52 99

Cardinal 0 52 99

Kasper 0 52 99

gave 0 52 99

his 0 52 99

infamous 0 52 99

consistory 0 52 99

speech 0 52 99

in 0 52 99
