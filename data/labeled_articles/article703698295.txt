The 0
Catholic 0

is 0
alive 0
today 0
with 0
criticism 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB’s 0
decision 0
to 0
sack 0
Fr. 0

Thomas 0
Weinandy, 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
their 0
doctrinal 0
office. 0

It 0
took 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
hours 0
for 0
the 0
brave 1
defenders 1
of 1
the 1
status 1
quo 1
to 0
leap 0
into 0

against 0
the 0
mild 0
Franciscan 0
friar’s 0
polite 0
plea 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Faith 0
and 0
faithful. 0

Or 0
at 0
least 0
to 0
stop 0
attacking 0
them. 0

In 0
a 0
letter 0
made 0
public 0
November 0
1st, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy, 0
a 0
former 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
for 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Bishops’ 0
Committee 0
on 0
Doctrine 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
International 0
Theological 0
Commission, 0
warned 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
caused 0
“chronic 0
confusion” 0
among 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
bishops. 0

He 0

wrote 0

to 0

the 0
pope, 0
“To 1
teach 1
with 1
such 1
an 1
intentional 1
lack 1
of 1
clarity 1
inevitably 1
risks 1
sinning 1
against 1
the 1
Holy 1
Spirit, 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
truth.” 1
He 0
added 0
that 0
Catholics 0
are 0
“disconcerted” 0
by 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
bishops 0
“who 0
seem 0
not 0
merely 0
open 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
views 0
counter 0
to 0
Christian 0
belief, 0
but 0
who 0
support 0
and 0
even 0
defend 0
them.” 0

In 0

an 0

interview 0

yesterday 0
with 0
John 0
Allen’s 0
Crux, 0
he 0
added, 0
more 0
prophetically 0
than 0
he 0
had 0
perhaps 0
intended, 0
“I 0
don’t 0
think 0
anyone 0
can, 0
or 0
should, 0
associate 0
my 0
letter 0
with 0
the 0
USCCB 0
or 0
the 0
American 0
bishops. 0

Neither 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
my 0
writing 0
the 0
letter, 0
and 0
its 0
publication 0
will 0
be 0
news 0
to 0
them.” 0

“Bishops 0

are 0

quick 0

learners,” 0
he 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
letter, 0
“and 0
what 0
many 0
have 0
learned 0
from 0
your 0
pontificate 0
is 0
not 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
open 0
to 0
criticism, 0
but 0
that 0
you 0
resent 0
it,” 0
claiming 0
that 0
many 0
bishops 0
don’t 1
speak 1
out 1
publicly 1
for 1
fear 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
“marginalized 1
or 1
worse.” 1

And 0

sure 0

enough, 0

within 0
hours 0
of 0
making 0
his 0
letter 0
public, 0
we 0
learned 0
that 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
had 0
been 0
given 1
the 1
boot. 1

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
Twitterverse 0
is 0
busy 0
commenting 0
on 0
the 0
irony: 0
how 0
a 0
man 0
expressing 0
grave 0
concerns 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
of 0
fear 0
of 0
being 0
punished 0
for 0
expressing 0
grave 0
concerns, 0
was 0
immediately 0
fired. 0

Perhaps 0

the 0

most 0

astonishing 0
aspect 0
of 0
this 0
little 1
incident 1
is 0
just 0
how 0
completely 0
blind 0
the 0
US 0
bishops 0
– 0
as 0
with 0
nearly 0
all 0
the 0
episcopate 0
– 0
are 0
to 0
what 0
political 0
analysts 0
call 0
the 0
“optics”. 0

Political 0
consultants 0
often 0
ask: 0
how 0
does 0
it 0
look? 0

And 0
it 0
looks 0
extremely 1
bad. 1

As 0
though 0
the 0
fog 0
of 0
irony 0
weren’t 0
thick 0
enough, 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
outrage 0
from 0
Catholics, 0
the 0
USCCB 0
has 0
done 0
what 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
cabal 0
have 0
done 0
and 0
started 0
blocking 0
critics 0
from 0
its 0
Twitter 0
account. 0

Which, 0
it 0
must 0
be 0
said, 0
only 0
proves 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
point 0
once 0
again. 0

Some 0

of 0

the 0

criticism 0
has 0
been 0
unusually 0
sharp. 0

Fr. 0

Hunwicke 0
wrote 0
this 0
afternoon, 0
“This 0
cheap 1
and 1
vulgar 1
ritual 1
humiliation 1
exemplifies 0
the 0
extent 0
to 0
which 0
P[ope] 0
F[rancis] 0
is 0
presiding 0
over 0
a 0
bully-boy 1
Church 1
in 0
which 0
midget 1
bishops 1
and 1
minicardinals 1
compete 0
to 0
defeat 0
each 0
other 0
in 0
the 0
sycophancy 0
stakes. 0

Just 0
as 0
Tom 0
Weinandy 0
has, 0
in 0
effect, 0
just 0
said.” 0

As 0

I 0

write 0

this, 0
the 0
outrage 0
is 0
doing 0
the 0
opposite 0
of 0
dying 0
down, 0
and 0
is 0
surely 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
how 0
fed 0
up 0
Catholics 0
– 0
even 0
those 0
who 0
would 0
never 0
identify 0
themselves 0
as 0
Traditionalists 0
– 0
have 0
become 0
with 0
this 0
pope 0
and 0
his 0
cadre 0
of 0
episcopal 1
bullies. 1

In 0
his 0
letter, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
made 0
a 0
point 0
of 0
stating 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
signatory 0
to 0
the 0
Filial 0
Correction 0
or 0
any 0
other 0
public 0
declaration 0
against 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
agenda. 0

In 0

fact, 0

a 0

former 0
student 0
of 0
his 0
wrote 0
to 0
me 0
today 0
saying, 0

“I 0
see 0
that 0
Fr. 0

Thomas 0
Weinandy 0
has 0
been 0
squashed. 0

He 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
my 0
professors 0
in 0
Patristics 0
at 0
Oxford 0
and 0
he 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
mild-mannered, 0
least 0
confrontational, 0
kindest 0
academics 0
one 0
could 0
have 0
hoped 0
to 0
meet. 0

To 0
me, 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
chosen 0
to 0
write 0
to 0
express 0
his 0
concern 0
about 0
the 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
papacy 0
is 0
very 0
significant. 0

He 0

is 0
neither 0
a 0
traditionalist, 0
nor 0
a 0
controversialist, 0
but 0
a 0
humble 0
and 0
straightforward 0
Friar 0
who 0
is 0
clear-thinking 0
and 0
entirely 0
loyal 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
Her 0
teaching. 0

I 0
would 0
be 0
surprised 0
now 0
if 0
we 0
were 0
not 0
see 0
more 0
of 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
letter/exercise 0
of 0
conscience. 0

I 0
imagine 0
that 0
it’s 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
harder 0
and 0
harder 0
for 0
men 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
position 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
fence.” 0

When 0
I 0
posted 0
it, 0
this 0
assessment 0
was 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
Joseph 0
Shaw, 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
UK’s 0
Latin 0
Mass 0
Society 0
and 0
the 0
spokesman 0
for 0
the 0
Filial 0
Correction, 0
who 0
wrote, 0
“This 0
is 0
absolutely 0
right. 0

Not 0
a 0
man 0
to 0
seek 0
out 0
confrontation.” 0

The 0

Crux 0
piece 0
offered 0
a 0
succinct 0
bullet 0
point 0
list 0
of 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
concerns. 0

He 0
said 0
the 0
pope 0
is… 0

Fostering 0
“chronic 0
confusion.” 0

“Demeaning” 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
doctrine. 0

Appointing 0
bishops 0
who 1
“scandalize” 1
believers 1
with 0
dubious 0
“teaching 0
and 0
pastoral 0
practice.” 0

Giving 0
prelates 0
who 0
object 0
the 0
impression 0
they’ll 1
be 1
“marginalized 1
or 1
worse” 1
if 1
they 1
speak 1
out. 1

Causing 0
faithful 0
Catholics 0
to 0
“lose 0
confidence 0
in 0
their 0
supreme 1
shepherd.” 1

Our 0
friend 0
Edward 0
Pentin 0
has 0
reproduced 0
the 0
full 0
text 0
of 0
the 0
letter 0
at 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register 0
which 0
is 0
definitely 0
worth 0
a 0
read. 0

Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
sent 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
on 0
July 0
31, 0
the 0
Feast 0
of 0
St. 0
Ignatius 0
of 0
Loyola. 0

Like 0
the 0
Dubia 0
cardinals, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
made 0
it 0
public 0
only 0
after 0
the 0
pope 0
had 0
ignored 0
it 0
for 0
months. 0

Notable 0

in 0
his 0
critique 0
is 0
its 0
distinct 0
pastoral 0
flavour, 0
his 0
concern 0
on 0
the 0
effect 0
the 0
situation 0
is 0
having 0
on 0
ordinary 0
people. 0

The 0
pope, 0
he 0
said, 0
seems 0
“to 0
censor 0
and 0
even 0
mock” 0
critics 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
for 0
their 0
desire 0
to 0
interpret 0
it 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
Catholic 0
teaching, 0
and 0
in 0
doing 0
so 0
is 0
committing 0
a 0
“kind 0
of 0
calumny…alien 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
Petrine 0
ministry.” 0

In 0

an 0
interview 0
with 0
Crux, 0
Weinandy 0
said 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
afraid 0
of 0
reprisals 0
but 0
“more 0
concerned 0
about 0
the 0
good 0
that 0
my 0
letter 0
might 0
do.” 0
The 0
letter 0
“expresses 0
the 0
concerns 0
of 0
many 0
more 0
people 0
than 0
just 0
me, 0
ordinary 0
people 0
who’ve 0
come 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
their 0
questions 0
and 0
apprehensions. 0

I 0
wanted 0
them 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
I 0
listened.” 0

“I 0

have 1
done 1
what 1
I 1
believe 1
God 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
do,[1]” 1
he 0
said. 0

In 0

fact, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
has 0
bolstered 1
my 1
own 1
“Great 1
Clarifier” 1
theory, 1
saying 0
that 0
this 0
pontificate, 0
and 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
response 0
to 0
it 0
from 0
priests 0
and 0
bishops, 0
is 0
being 0
allowed 0
by 0
God 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
reveal 0
“just 0
how 0
weak 0
is 0
the 0
faith 0
of 0
many 0
within 0
the 0
Church,” 0
He 0
added 0
that 0
Francis 0
has 0
revealed 0
that 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
“hold 0
harmful 0
theological 0
and 0
pastoral 0
views.” 0

Which 0

inevitably 0
brings 0
to 0
mind 0
other 0
responses 0
that 0
have 0
not 0
been 0
quite 0
so 0
clear, 0
nor 0
so 0
pastoral. 0

When 0

Cardinal 0
Muller 0
was 0
removed 0
abruptly 0
from 0
his 0
position 0
as 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CDF, 0
the 0
conservative 0
Catholic 0
world 0
wailed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
another 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
“good” 0
prelate 0
being 0
got 0
rid 0
of. 0

And 0
it 0
seems 0
clear 0
from 0
the 0
way 0
it 0
was 0
done, 0
and 0
the 0
way 0
Francis 0
treated 0
Muller 0
in 0
general, 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
indeed 0
got 1
rid 1
of. 1

But 0
his 0
depiction 0
by 0
conservative 0
writers 0
as 0
a 0
beleaguered 0
champion 0
of 0
Catholic 0
orthodoxy 0
persecuted 0
by 0
the 0
regime 0
for 0
his 0
faithfulness 0
betrays 0
a 0
somewhat 0
selective 0
memory 0
and 0
short 0
attention 0
span. 0

Ed 0
Pentin 0
has 0
a 0
long 0
file 0
of 0
interviews 0
and 0
articles 0
about 0
Muller 0
that 0
clearly 0
show 0
his 0
complete 0
inability 0
to 0
make 0
up 0
his 0
mind 0
whose 0
side 0
he’s 0
on. 0

A 0

quick 0
examination 0
of 0
Muller’s 0
interviews 0
and 0
statements 0
reveal 0
an 0
irresolute 0
and 0
ultimately 0
calculating 0
mind 0
of 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
is 0
– 0
so 0
I 0
am 0
told 0
by 0
sources 0
close 0
to 0
him 0
– 0
motivated 0
mainly 0
by 0
a 0
puerile 0
desire 0
to 0
be 0
approved 0
of 0
by 0
the 1
“cool 1
kids” 1
in 1
the 1
Vatican, 1
on 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
and 0
an 0
unshakeable 0
conviction 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
theological 0
brilliance 0
on 0
the 0
other. 0

Most 0

recently, 0
on 0
October 0
30th, 0
Crux 0
quoted 0
him 0
under 0
the 0
headline, 0
“Cardinal 0
Muller 0
backs 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
against 0
critics 0
of 0
‘Amoris 0
Laetitia’” 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CDF 0
has 0
at 0
last 0
climbed 0
on 0
board 0
the 0
Kasperian 0
train 0
on 0
reception 0
of 0
Communion 0
for 0
unrepentant 0
adulterers. 0

Signaling 1

furiously 1
with 0
the 0
trendy 0
FrancisChurch 0
buzzwords 0
and 0
even 0
trendier 0
blithering 1
incoherence, 1
Muller 0
writes 0
that 0
“mitigating 0
factors 0
in 0
guilt,” 0
can 0
lead, 0
couples 0
in 0
“an 0
uncertain 0
marital 0
situation” 0
through 0
a 0
“path 0
of 0
repentance” 0
– 0
always 0
“accompanied” 0
by 0
an 0
exquisitely 0
sensitive 0
confessor 0
– 0
to 0
a 0
point 0
where 0
the 0
reception 0
of 0
Communion 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
sinful. 0

Presumably 1
because 1
adultery 1
itself 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
sinful. 1

Or 0
sacrilege 0
either, 0
I 0
guess. 0

Or 0
something. 0

Somehow 0
the 0
“new 0
evangelization” 0
is 0
involved 0
in 0
this, 0
though 0
it’s 0
unclear 0
how 0
exactly 0
it 0
makes 0
adultery 0
and 0
sacrilege 0
OK. 0
Also, 0
it’s 0
very 0
important 0
to 0
fulfill 0
the 0
Sunday 0
Mass 0
obligation, 0
and 0
as 0
everyone 0
knows, 0
one 0
can’t 0
possibly 0
go 0
to 0
Mass 0
on 0
a 0
Sunday 0
without 0
receiving 0
Communion. 0

We 0

hear 0
again, 0
as 0
we 0
did 0
incessantly 0
from 0
the 0
Kasperians 0
at 0
the 0
Synods, 0
about 0
the 0
hard 0
case 0
of 0
the 1
poor, 1
poor 1
woman 1
who 0
has 0
been 0
abandoned 0
by 0
the 0
first 0
husband, 0
and 0
who 0
“finds 0
no 0
other 0
way 0
out 0
than 0
to 0
entrust 0
oneself 0
to 0
a 0
kind-hearted 0
person,” 0
… 0
with 1
whom, 1
I 1
guess, 1
she 1
has 1
also 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
have 1
sexual 1
relations. 1

Because 1
of 1
kind-heartedness. 1

Anyway, 0

the 0
result 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
“marriage-like 0
relationship” 0
about 0
which 0
confessors 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
careful 0
not 0
to 0
say 0
mean 0
things. 0

Or 0
be 0
too 0
“extreme”. 0

It’s 0
very 0
important 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
avoid 0
a 0
“cheap 0
adaptation 0
to 0
the 0
relativistic 1
Zeitgeist,” 1
on 0
one 0
side, 0
and 0
a 0
“cold 0
application 0
of 0
the 0
dogmatic 0
commandments 0
and 0
the 0
canonical 0
rules,” 0
on 0
the 0
other. 0

Because 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
too 0
polarizing. 0

And 0
mean. 0

And 0

anyway, 0
sins 0
of 0
the 0
flesh 0
aren’t 0
the 0
worst 0
things 0
ever. 0

There 0
are, 0
like, 0
“different 0
levels” 0
of 0
gravity, 0
you 0
know? 0

And, 0
like, 0
it 0
depends 0
on 0
the 0
type 0
of 0
sin, 0
right? 0

“Spirit’s 0
sins” 0
like 0
spiritual 0
pride 0
and 0
avarice 0
and 0
stuff, 0
are 0
worse 0
than 0
“sins 0
of 0
the 0
flesh,” 0
you 0
know? 0

Which 0
are, 0
like, 0
only 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“human 0
weakness,” 0
right? 0

Apparently 0

the 0
real 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
whole 0
thing 0
has 0
been 0
that 0
the 0
Kasperian 0
kerfuffle 0
has 0
totally 0
been 0
blown 0
way, 0
way, 0
WAY 0
out 0
of 0
proportion, 0
and 0
the 0
“polarization” 0
it 0
has 0
caused 0
has 0
been 0
“regrettable”. 0

The 0
question 0
of 0
Communion 0
for 0
divorced 0
and 0
civilly 0
“remarried” 0
Catholics, 0
he 0
said, 0
has 0
been 0
“falsely 1
elevated 1
to 1
the 1
rank 1
of 1
a 1
decisive 1
question 1
of 1
Catholicism 1
and 1
a 1
measure 1
of 1
ideological 1
comparison 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
decide 1
whether 1
one 1
is 1
conservative 1
or 1
liberal, 1
in 1
favor 1
or 1
against 1
the 1
pope.” 1

For 0

years 0
under 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
Muller 0
was 0
engaged 0
in 0
an 0
open 0
war 0
with 0
the 0
German 0
episcopate 0
who 0
insisted 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
allow 0
Communion 0
for 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried, 0
no 0
matter 0
what 0
Rome 0
said, 0
even 1
threatening 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
schism 1
if 1
they 1
didn’t 1
get 1
their 1
way[2]. 0

Muller, 0

with 0
little 0
backing 0
from 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
– 0
who 0
appeared 0
content 0
to 0
allow 0
his 0
CDF 0
prefect 0
and 0
the 0
Germans 0
shout 0
out 0
their 0
differences 0
– 0
and 0
with 0
outright 0
opposition 0
from 0
Francis, 0
did 0
indeed 0
strive 0
to 0
hold 0
the 0
line. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
Francis 0
orchestrated 0
the 0
Synods 0
to 0
undermine 0
him 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
his 0
fault. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
difficult 0
to 0
imagine 0
anyone 0
being 0
in 0
a 0
worse 0
position 0
than 0
he 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

But 0

since 0
then, 0
Muller 0
has 0
demonstrated 0
very 0
little 0
of 0
his 0
former 0
grit, 0
instead 0
attempting 0
from 0
one 0
day 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
to 0
appease 0
both 0
sides. 0

Reportedly 0
removed 0
from 0
CDF 0
– 0
and 0
of 0
course 0
lionized 1
by 0
“conservatives” 0
– 0
for 0
his 0
mild 0
and 0
equivocating 0
opposition 0
to 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia, 0
Muller 0
has 0
gone 0
back 0
and 0
forth 0
in 0
what 0
can 0
easily 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
a 0
desperate 0
attempt 0
to 0
find 0
friends 0
in 0
both 0
camps. 0

With 0
this 0
in 0
mind 0
one 0
could 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
not 0
taking 0
his 0
October 0
30th 0
essay 0
too 0
seriously. 0

Perhaps 0

one 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
effects 0
to 0
come 0
from 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
persecution 0
will 0
be 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
how 0
a 0
pastor 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
act. 0

As 0
my 0
friend 0
said, 0
maybe 0
“it’s 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
harder 0
and 0
harder 0
for 0
men 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
position 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
fence,” 0
assuming 0
there 0
are 0
any 0
left. 0

In 0
this 0
interview, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
gave 0
a 0
remarkable 0
story 0
of 0
how 0
his 0
prayer 0
for 0
a 0
“sign” 0
that 0
he 0
ought 0
to 0
write 0
the 0
letter 0
was 0
very 0
specifically 0
answered: 0
“If 0
you 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
something, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
give 0
me 0
a 0
clear 0
sign,” 0
Weinandy 0
recalls 0
saying. 0

“Tomorrow 0
morning, 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
Saint 0
Mary 0
Major’s 0
to 0
pray, 0
and 0
then 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
Saint 0
John 0
Lateran. 0

After 0
that, 0
I’m 0
coming 0
back 0
to 0
Saint 0
Peter’s 0
to 0
have 0
lunch 0
with 0
a 0
seminary 0
friend 0
of 0
mine.” 0
“During 0
that 0
interval, 0
I 0
must 0
meet 0
someone 0
that 0
I 0
know 0
but 0
have 0
not 0
seen 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time, 0
and 0
would 0
never 0
expect 0
to 0
see 0
in 0
Rome 0
at 0
this 0
time. 0

That 0
person 0
cannot 0
be 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Canada 0
or 0
Great 0
Britain. 0

Moreover, 0
that 0
person 0
has 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
me, 0
‘Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing’.” 0
Weinandy 0
said, 0
exactly 0
that 0
happened 0
the 0
next 0
day, 0
in 0
a 0
chance 0
meeting 0
with 0
an 0
archbishop 0
he’d 0
known 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago 0
but 0
not 0
seen 0
for 0
over 0
twenty 0
years, 0
who 0
congratulated 0
him 0
for 0
a 0
book 0
on 0
the 0
Incarnation 0
and 0
then 0
said 0
the 0
right 0
words, 0
“Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing.” 0
“There 0
was 0
no 0
longer 0
any 0
doubt 0
in 0
my 0
mind 0
that 0
Jesus 0
wanted 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
something,” 0
Weinandy 0
said. 0

[2] 0
It’s 0
notable 0
that 0
these 0
howling 1
tantrums 1
from 0
the 0
German 0
bishops 0
halted 0
abruptly 0
about 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
Kasper 0
gave 0
his 0
infamous 0
consistory 0
speech 0
in 0
February 0
2014. 0
