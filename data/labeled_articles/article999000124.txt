However, 0 418 4
his 0 418 4
jokes 0 418 4
quickly 0 418 4
progressed 0 418 4
to 0 418 4
uncomfortable 0 418 4
territory, 0 418 4
including 0 418 4
one 0 418 4

is 0 418 4
definitely 0 418 4
not 0 418 4
a 0 418 4
choice 0 418 4
because 1 418 4
no 1 418 4
one 1 418 4

to 1 418 4
be 1 418 4

and 1 418 4
black.” 1 418 4
The 0 418 4
tension 0 418 4
in 0 418 4
the 0 418 4
room 0 418 4
increased 0 418 4
as 0 418 4
Patel 0 418 4
told 0 418 4
more 0 418 4
jokes 0 418 4
in 0 418 4
this 0 418 4
vein 0 418 4
until 0 418 4
organizers 0 418 4
of 0 418 4
the 0 418 4
event 0 418 4
went 0 418 4
up 0 418 4
on 0 418 4
stage 0 418 4
to 0 418 4
stop 0 418 4
him, 0 418 4
citing 0 418 4

change 0 418 4
in 0 418 4

plans. 0 418 4

this 0 418 5
was 0 418 5
happening. 0 418 5

The 0 418 6
organizers 0 418 6

tech 0 418 6
had 0 418 6
to 0 418 6
leave 0 418 6
early, 0 418 6
but 0 418 6
Patel 0 418 6
continued 0 418 6
to 0 418 6
claim 0 418 6
that 0 418 6
he 0 418 6
was 0 418 6
being 0 418 6
cut 0 418 6
off 0 418 6
because 0 418 6
the 0 418 6
audience 0 418 6
didn’t 0 418 6
like 0 418 6
his 0 418 6
jokes. 0 418 6

At 0 418 7
one 0 418 7
point, 0 418 7
one 0 418 7

He 0 418 9
tried 0 418 9
to 0 418 9
continue 0 418 9

until 0 418 9
his 0 418 9
