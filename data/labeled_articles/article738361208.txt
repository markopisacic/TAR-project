former 1
top 1
spook 1

Following 0
what 0
has 0
appeared 0
for 0
months 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
strained 0
relationship 0
between 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
and 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Rex 0
Tillerson, 0
the 0
top 0
diplomat 0
is 0
being 0
replaced. 0

Trump 0
announced 0
Tillerson’s 0
ouster 0
via 0
Twitter 0
Tuesday, 0
saying: 0
“Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
will 0
become 0
our 0
new 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

He 1
will 1
do 1
a 1
fantastic 1
job! 1

Thank 0
you 0
to 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
for 0
his 0
service! 0

Gina 0
Haspel 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
new 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
and 0
the 0
first 0
woman 0
so 0
chosen. 0

Congratulations 0
to 0
all!” 0

This 0
is 0
yet 0
another 0
big 0
shake-up 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
still-young 0
administration 0
— 0
and 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
one 1
to 1
date. 1

The 1
move 1
creates 1
some 1
big 1
questions 1
about 1
both 1
the 1
administration’s 1
foreign 1
policy 1
ambitions 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
president’s 1
relationship 1
with 1
the 1
deep 1
state. 1

If 1
you 1
enjoyed 1
Hillary 1
Clinton’s 1
tenure 1
as 1
Secretary 1
of 1
State, 1
you’ll 1
like 1
Pompeo’s. 1

Like 0
Clinton 0
and 0
her 0
Democrat 0
allies, 0
Pompeo 0
has 0
long 0
subscribed 0
to 0
the 0
belief 0
that 0
Russia 0
is 1
perpetually 1
meddling 1
in 0
U.S. 0
affairs. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 1
believes 1
Barack 1
Obama 1
got 1
Russian 1
help 1
too. 1

While 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
confirmed 0
as 0
CIA 0
chief, 0
the 0
former 0
lawmaker 0
lashed 1
out 1
at 1
Russia 1
for 0
reasserting 1
” 1
itself 1
aggressively, 1
invading 1
and 1
occupying 1
Ukraine, 1
threatening 1
Europe, 1
and 1
doing 1
nearly 1
nothing 1
to 1
aid 1
in 1
the 1
destruction 1
and 1
defeat 1
of 1
ISIS.” 1

Again, 0
if 0
you 0
liked 0
Obama-era, 0
world-on-fire, 0
Russians 0
everywhere 0
State 1
Department 1
shenanigans, 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
guy. 1

Pompeo 1
also 1
isn’t 1
a 1
huge 1
fan 1
of 1
calling 1
the 1
federal 1
government 1
out 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
clearly 1
violating 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
Americans, 1
as 0
shown 0
by 0
his 0
statements 0
last 0
year 0
regarding 0
WikiLeaks. 0

“It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
call 0
out 0
WikiLeaks 0
for 0
what 0
it 0
really 0
is 0
– 0
a 1
non-state 1
hostile 1
intelligence 1
service 1
often 0
abetted 0
by 0
state 0
actors 0
like 0
Russia. 0

In 0
January 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
our 0
Intelligence 0
Community 0
determined 0
that 0
Russian 0
military 0
intelligence 0
— 0
the 0
GRU 0
— 0
had 0
used 0
WikiLeaks 0
to 0
release 0

that 0
the 0
GRU 0
had 0
obtained 0
through 0

operations 0
against 0
the 0
Democratic 0

Committee. 0

And 0
the 0
report 0
also 0
found 0
that 0
Russia’s 0
primary 0
propaganda 0
outlet, 0
RT, 0
has 0
actively 0
collaborated 0
with 0
WikiLeaks,” 0

Pompeo 0

City… 0

Moving 0
on 0
to 0
Haspel, 0
who 0
will 0
now 0
be 0
heading 0
the 0
CIA, 0
nothing’s 1
looking 1
any 1
brighter. 1

She’s 1
a 1
big 1
fan 1
of 1
torture, 1
according 0
to 0
a 0
2013 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article 0
pointed 0
out 0
this 0
morning 0
by 0
The 0
Intercept: 0

IN 0
MAY 0
2013, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
Greg 0
Miller 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
clandestine 0
service 0
was 0
being 0
shifted 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“a 0
management 0
shake-up” 0
by 0
then-Director 0
John 0
Brennan. 0

As 0
Miller 0
documented, 0
this 0
official 0
— 0
whom 0
the 0
paper 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
because 0
she 0
was 0
a 0
covert 0
agent 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
— 0
was 0
centrally 0
involved 0
in 0
the 1
worst 1
abuses 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
Bush-era 1
torture 1
regime. 1

As 0
Miller 0
put 0
it, 0
she 0
was 0
“directly 0
involved 0
in 0
its 0
controversial 0
interrogation 0
program” 0
and 0
had 0
an 0
“extensive 0
role” 0
in 0
torturing 0
detainees. 0

Even 0
more 0
troubling, 0
she 0
“had 0
run 0
a 0
secret 0
prison 0
in 0
Thailand” 0
— 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
network 0
of 0
“black 0
sites” 0
— 0
“where 0
two 0
detainees 0
were 0
subjected 0
to 0
waterboarding 0
and 0
other 0
harsh 1
techniques.” 1
The 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee’s 0
report 0
on 0
torture 0
also 0
detailed 0
the 0
central 0
role 0
she 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
particularly 1
gruesome 1
torture 1
of 0
detainee 0
Abu 0
Zubaydah. 0

Beyond 0
all 0
that, 0
she 0
played 0
a 0
vital 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
interrogation 0
videotapes 0
that 0
showed 0
the 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
both 0
at 0
the 0
black 0
site 0
she 0
ran 0
and 0
other 0
secret 0
agency 0
locations. 0

The 0
concealment 0
of 0
those 0
interrogation 0
tapes, 0
which 0
violated 0
multiple 0
court 0
orders 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
9/11 0
commission 0
and 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
White 0
House 0
lawyers, 0
was 0
condemned 0
as 0
“obstruction” 0
by 0
commission 0
chairs 0
Lee 0
Hamilton 0
and 0
Thomas 0
Keane. 0

A 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
and 0
grand 0
jury 0
investigated 0
those 0
actions 0
but 0
ultimately 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

Bottom 0
line, 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush/Barack 0
Obama 0
era 0
foreign 0
policy 0
and 0
intelligence 0
doctrines 0
aren’t 0
going 0
anywhere 0
under 0
Trump. 0
