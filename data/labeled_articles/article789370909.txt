The 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
recounted 0 365 5
a 0 365 5
claim 0 365 5
by 0 365 5
Deborah 0 365 5
Ramirez, 0 365 5
a 0 365 5
Yale 0 365 5

of 0 365 5
Brett 0 365 5
Kavanaugh’s, 0 365 5
concerning 0 365 5
“a 0 365 5
dormitory 0 365 5
party 0 365 5
gone 0 365 5
awry.” 0 365 5
As 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
acknowledged, 0 365 5
however, 0 365 5
“her 0 365 5
memories 0 365 5
contained 0 365 5
gaps 0 365 5
because 0 365 5
she 0 365 5
had 0 365 5
been 0 365 5
drinking 0 365 5
at 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
time 0 365 5
of 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
alleged 0 365 5
incident.” 0 365 5
The 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
goes 0 365 5
on 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
say 0 365 5
that 0 365 5
in 0 365 5
her 0 365 5
initial 0 365 5
conversations 0 365 5
with 0 365 5
The 0 365 5
New 0 365 5
Yorker, 0 365 5
Ms. 0 365 5
Ramirez 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
“reluctant 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
characterize 0 365 5
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 5
role 0 365 5
in 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
alleged 0 365 5
incident 0 365 5
with 0 365 5
certainty.” 0 365 5
It 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
only 0 365 5
after 0 365 5
“six 0 365 5
days 0 365 5
of 0 365 5
carefully 0 365 5
assessing 0 365 5

and 0 365 5
consulting 0 365 5
with 0 365 5
her 0 365 5
attorney” 0 365 5
that 0 365 5
Ms. 0 365 5
Ramirez 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
suddenly 0 365 5
able 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
pinpoint 0 365 5
Judge 0 365 5
Kavanaugh 0 365 5
as 0 365 5
having 0 365 5
committed 0 365 5
an 0 365 5
unsavory 0 365 5
act, 0 365 5
even 0 365 5
though 0 365 5
she 0 365 5
admitted 0 365 5
being 0 365 5
“foggy” 0 365 5
at 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
time. 0 365 5

The 0 365 6
New 0 365 6
Yorker 0 365 6
article 0 365 6
also 0 365 6
noted 0 365 6
that 0 365 6
the 0 365 6
magazine 0 365 6
“has 0 365 6
not 0 365 6
confirmed 0 365 6

that 0 365 6

at 0 365 6
the 0 365 6

information 0 365 7
from 0 365 7

Judge 0 365 7

his 0 365 7

to 0 365 7

"gang 0 365 7

Haters 1 365 8
of 1 365 8
Judge 1 365 8
Kavanaugh 1 365 8
are 0 365 8
turning 0 365 8
the 0 365 8
process 0 365 8
of 0 365 8

of 0 365 8
a 0 365 8

nominee 0 365 8
into 0 365 8
something 0 365 8
worse 1 365 8
than 1 365 8
a 1 365 8
travesty. 1 365 8

His 0 365 9
opponents 0 365 9
in 0 365 9
the 0 365 9

these 0 365 10

that 0 365 10

Among 0 365 12
the 0 365 12
issues 0 365 12
Ms. 0 365 12
Ford’s 0 365 12

A 0 365 13
week 0 365 13
has 0 365 13
already 0 365 13
gone 0 365 13
by 0 365 13
since 0 365 13

They 0 365 14
raised 0 365 14
one 0 365 14
procedural 0 365 14
issue 0 365 14
after 0 365 14
another 0 365 14
while 0 365 14
claiming 0 365 14
that 0 365 14
the 0 365 14
committee 0 365 14

Charles 0 365 15
Grassley 0 365 15
(R-I) 0 365 15
has 0 365 15
bent 1 365 15
over 1 365 15
backwards 1 365 15
to 0 365 15
accommodate 0 365 15
Ms. 0 365 15
Ford’s 0 365 15
preferred 0 365 15
scheduling 0 365 15
for 0 365 15
her 0 365 15
appearance. 0 365 15

He 0 365 16
extended 0 365 16
the 0 365 16
deadline 0 365 16
several 0 365 16
times 0 365 16
for 0 365 16

to 0 365 16
come 0 365 16
to 0 365 16
a 0 365 16
decision 0 365 16
on 0 365 16
whether 0 365 16
to 0 365 16
testify 0 365 16
at 0 365 16
all. 0 365 16

He 0 365 17
had 0 365 17
offered 0 365 17
various 0 365 17
options 0 365 17
for 0 365 17
her 0 365 17
to 0 365 17
testify 0 365 17
publicly 0 365 17
or 0 365 17
privately 0 365 17

in 0 365 17
her 0 365 17
home 0 365 17
state 0 365 17
of 0 365 17
California, 0 365 17
whichever 0 365 17
setting 0 365 17
would 0 365 17
make 0 365 17
her 0 365 17
more 0 365 17
comfortable. 0 365 17

However, 0 365 18
in 0 365 18
Senator 0 365 18
Grassley’s 0 365 18
e-mail 0 365 18
thanking 0 365 18
Ms. 0 365 18
Ford 0 365 18
for 0 365 18
finally 0 365 18
agreeing 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
a 0 365 18
time 0 365 18
certain 0 365 18
for 0 365 18
her 0 365 18
testimony, 0 365 18
Senator 0 365 18
Grassley 0 365 18
correctly 0 365 18
reminded 0 365 18
her 0 365 18
attorneys 0 365 18
that 0 365 18
“the 0 365 18
committee 0 365 18
determines 0 365 18
which 0 365 18
witnesses 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
call, 0 365 18
how 0 365 18
many 0 365 18
witnesses 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
call, 0 365 18
and 0 365 18
what 0 365 18
order 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
call 0 365 18
them 0 365 18
and 0 365 18
who 0 365 18
will 0 365 18
question 0 365 18
them. 0 365 18

These 0 365 19
are 0 365 19
nonnegotiable.” 0 365 19

While 0 365 20
the 0 365 20
negotiations 0 365 20
with 0 365 20
Ms. 0 365 20
Ford’s 0 365 20
attorneys 0 365 20
for 0 365 20
her 0 365 20
testimony 0 365 20
were 0 365 20
underway, 0 365 20
Democrats 0 365 20
were 0 365 20
sitting 0 365 20
on 0 365 20
the 0 365 20
latest 0 365 20
allegations, 0 365 20
ready 1 365 20
to 1 365 20
pounce 1 365 20
as 0 365 20
soon 0 365 20
as 0 365 20
Ms. 0 365 20
Ford’s 0 365 20
accusation 0 365 20
was 0 365 20
about 0 365 20
to 0 365 20
be 0 365 20
heard. 0 365 20

Some 0 365 21
Democrats 0 365 21
are 0 365 21
already 0 365 21
using 0 365 21
the 0 365 21
Ramirez 0 365 21
episode 0 365 21
to 0 365 21
push 0 365 21
anew 0 365 21
for 0 365 21
a 0 365 21
fresh 0 365 21
FBI 0 365 21
investigation 0 365 21
and 0 365 21
to 0 365 21
postpone 0 365 21
Thursday’s 0 365 21
scheduled 0 365 21
hearing. 0 365 21

Ideally, 0 365 22
if 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
Democrats 0 365 22
cannot 0 365 22
apply 0 365 22
enough 0 365 22
pressure 0 365 22
to 0 365 22
force 0 365 22
a 0 365 22
withdrawal 0 365 22
of 0 365 22

What 1 365 30
we 1 365 30

know 1 365 30
so 1 365 30
far 1 365 30

the 1 365 30
credibility 1 365 30
of 1 365 30
Ms. 1 365 30
Ford’s 1 365 30
accusation. 1 365 30

Ms. 0 365 31
Ford 0 365 31
cannot 0 365 31
corroborate 0 365 31
her 0 365 31
decades-old 0 365 31
charge 0 365 31
of 0 365 31
sexual 0 365 31

against 0 365 31

Whatever 1 365 32
corroboration 1 365 32
Ms. 1 365 32
Ford 1 365 32
was 1 365 32
hoping 1 365 32
for 1 365 32
from 1 365 32
“witnesses” 1 365 32
she 1 365 32
claimed 1 365 32
were 1 365 32
at 1 365 32
the 1 365 32
alleged 1 365 32
party 1 365 32
is 1 365 32
non-existent. 1 365 32

The 0 365 33
individuals 0 365 33
she 0 365 33
reportedly 0 365 33
named 0 365 33
in 0 365 33
her 0 365 33
unredacted 0 365 33
confidential 0 365 33
letter 0 365 33
given 0 365 33
to 0 365 33
Senator 0 365 33

have 0 365 33
either 0 365 33
denied 0 365 33
being 0 365 33
at 0 365 33
such 0 365 33
a 0 365 33
party 0 365 33
or 0 365 33
do 0 365 33
not 0 365 33
recollect 0 365 33
what 0 365 33
Ms. 0 365 33
Ford 0 365 33
has 0 365 33
alleged. 0 365 33

Moreover, 0 365 34
by 0 365 34
her 0 365 34
own 0 365 34
admission 0 365 34
to 0 365 34
the 0 365 34

Ms. 0 365 34
Ford 0 365 34
“said 0 365 34
she 0 365 34

key 0 365 34
details 0 365 34
of 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
incident.” 0 365 34
She 0 365 34
does 0 365 34
not 0 365 34
remember, 0 365 34
for 0 365 34
example, 0 365 34
where 0 365 34
it 0 365 34
happened, 0 365 34
how 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
party 0 365 34
came 0 365 34
together 0 365 34
in 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
first 0 365 34
place, 0 365 34
or 0 365 34
how 0 365 34
she 0 365 34
got 0 365 34
home 0 365 34
after 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
alleged 0 365 34
incident. 0 365 34

She 0 365 35
believes 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
alleged 0 365 35
incident 0 365 35
occurred 0 365 35
during 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
summer 0 365 35
of 0 365 35
1982, 0 365 35
but 0 365 35
reportedly 0 365 35
could 0 365 35
not 0 365 35
be 0 365 35
more 0 365 35
precise 0 365 35
on 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
day 0 365 35
or 0 365 35
even 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
month 0 365 35
of 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
party. 0 365 35

Afraid 0 365 36
that 0 365 36
Ms. 0 365 36
Ford’s 0 365 36
sexual 0 365 36
assault 0 365 36
allegation 0 365 36
could 0 365 36
be 0 365 36
readily 0 365 36
challenged 0 365 36
and 0 365 36
anxious 0 365 36
to 0 365 36
establish 0 365 36
some 0 365 36
sort 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
pattern 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
sexual 0 365 36
misconduct 0 365 36
beyond 0 365 36
this 0 365 36
single 0 365 36
alleged 0 365 36
incident, 0 365 36
the 1 365 36
Kavanaugh 1 365 36
haters 1 365 36
have 0 365 36
latched 0 365 36
onto 0 365 36
Ms. 0 365 36
Ramirez’s 0 365 36
story. 0 365 36

The 0 365 37
New 0 365 37
York 0 365 37
Times 0 365 37
published 0 365 37
an 0 365 37
op-ed 0 365 37
column 0 365 37
last 0 365 37
week 0 365 37
by 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
psychiatrist, 0 365 37
Richard 0 365 37
A. 0 365 37
Friedman, 0 365 37
who 0 365 37
cited 0 365 37
neurological 0 365 37
science 0 365 37
to 0 365 37
conclude 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
Ms. 0 365 37
Ford’s 0 365 37
claim 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
she 0 365 37
has 0 365 37
“a 0 365 37
vivid 0 365 37
memory 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
an 0 365 37
attack 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
took 0 365 37
place 0 365 37
when 0 365 37
she 0 365 37
was 0 365 37
15” 0 365 37
is 0 365 37
“credible.” 0 365 37
The 0 365 37
reason, 0 365 37
he 0 365 37
wrote, 0 365 37
is 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
“memories 0 365 37
formed 0 365 37
under 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
influence 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
intense 0 365 37
emotion 0 365 37
— 0 365 37
such 0 365 37
as 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
feelings 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
accompany 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
sexual 0 365 37
assault 0 365 37
— 0 365 37
are 0 365 37
indelible 0 365 37
in 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
way 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
memories 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
routine 0 365 37
day 0 365 37
are 0 365 37
not.” 0 365 37
The 1 365 37
only 1 365 37
problem 1 365 37
with 1 365 37
Dr. 1 365 37
Friedman’s 1 365 37
thesis 1 365 37
is 1 365 37
that 1 365 37
Ms. 1 365 37
Ford 1 365 37
has 1 365 37
apparently 1 365 37
forgotten 1 365 37
such 1 365 37
key 1 365 37
details 1 365 37
surrounding 1 365 37
the 1 365 37
alleged 1 365 37
sexual 1 365 37
assault 1 365 37
as 1 365 37
when 1 365 37
and 1 365 37
where 1 365 37
it 1 365 37
happened 1 365 37
and 1 365 37
how 1 365 37
she 1 365 37
got 1 365 37
home. 1 365 37

Moreover, 0 365 38
when 0 365 38
Ms. 0 365 38
Ford 0 365 38
finally 0 365 38
told 0 365 38
someone 0 365 38
about 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
incident 0 365 38
in 0 365 38

told 0 365 42
men 0 365 42
to 0 365 42
“shut 0 365 42
up” 0 365 42
regarding 0 365 42
Ms. 0 365 42
Ford’s 0 365 42
allegations, 0 365 42
said 0 365 42
she 1 365 42
doubts 1 365 42
Judge 1 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 42
credibility 1 365 42
because 1 365 42
of 1 365 42
“how 1 365 42
he 1 365 42
approaches 1 365 42
his 1 365 42
cases.” 1 365 42
Aside 0 365 42
from 0 365 42
mischaracterizing 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
constitutional 0 365 42
textualist 0 365 42
reasoning 0 365 42
underlying 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
opinions, 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
is 0 365 42
saying 0 365 42
that 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
does 0 365 42
not 0 365 42
believe 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
denial 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
sexual 0 365 42
misconduct 0 365 42
allegations 0 365 42
lodged 0 365 42
against 0 365 42
him 0 365 42
because 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
opinions 0 365 42
he 0 365 42
wrote 0 365 42
that 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
does 0 365 42
not 0 365 42
like. 0 365 42

Such 0 365 43
circular 0 365 43
“reasoning” 0 365 43
would 0 365 43
be 0 365 43
amusing 0 365 43
if 0 365 43
it 0 365 43
were 0 365 43
not 0 365 43
so 0 365 43
emblematic 0 365 43
of 0 365 43
what 0 365 43
one 0 365 43
writer 0 365 43
called 0 365 43
“Kavanaugh 1 365 43
Derangement 1 365 43
Syndrome." 1 365 43

Senator 0 365 44
Kirsten 0 365 44
Gillibrand 0 365 44
(D-N.Y.) 0 365 44
is 0 365 44
also 0 365 44
suffering 0 365 44
from 0 365 44
the 0 365 44
same 0 365 44
syndrome. 0 365 44

She 0 365 45
said 0 365 45
Thursday 0 365 45
regarding 0 365 45
Ms. 0 365 45
Ford: 0 365 45
"I 0 365 45
believe 1 365 45
her 1 365 45
because 1 365 45
she 1 365 45
is 1 365 45
telling 1 365 45
the 1 365 45
truth 1 365 45
and 1 365 45
you 1 365 45
know 1 365 45
it 1 365 45
by 1 365 45
her 1 365 45
story." 1 365 45

Ms. 0 365 46
Ford’s 0 365 46
supporters 0 365 46
are 0 365 46
exploiting 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
“Me 1 365 46
Too” 1 365 46
movement 1 365 46
to 0 365 46
declare 0 365 46
Judge 0 365 46
Kavanaugh 0 365 46
guilty 0 365 46
simply 1 365 46
because 1 365 46
Ms. 1 365 46
Ford 1 365 46
is 1 365 46
a 1 365 46
woman 1 365 46
who 1 365 46
has 1 365 46
made 1 365 46
what 1 365 46
they 1 365 46
call, 1 365 46
without 1 365 46
any 1 365 46
corroborating 1 365 46
evidence 1 365 46
to 1 365 46
date, 1 365 46
a 1 365 46
“credible” 1 365 46
charge. 1 365 46

The 0 365 47
same 0 365 47
would 0 365 47
presumably 0 365 47
be 0 365 47
the 0 365 47
case 0 365 47
for 0 365 47
Ms. 0 365 47
Ramirez. 0 365 47

They 0 365 48
argue 0 365 48
that 0 365 48
since 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
Senate 0 365 48
Judiciary 0 365 48
Committee 0 365 48
is 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
criminal 0 365 48
judicial 0 365 48
trial, 0 365 48
but 0 365 48
rather 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
legislative 0 365 48
hearing 0 365 48
for 0 365 48
confirmation 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
Supreme 0 365 48
Court 0 365 48
nominee, 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
normal 0 365 48
burden 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
proof 0 365 48
shouldered 0 365 48
by 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
accuser 0 365 48
should 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
apply. 0 365 48

Judge 0 365 49
Kavanaugh 0 365 49
should 0 365 49
have 0 365 49
to 0 365 49
prove 0 365 49
that 0 365 49
he 0 365 49
is 0 365 49
not 0 365 49
guilty, 0 365 49
they 0 365 49
are 0 365 49
in 0 365 49
effect 0 365 49
insisting. 0 365 49

This 0 365 50
is 0 365 50
another 0 365 50
case 0 365 50
of 0 365 50
Kavanaugh 1 365 50
Derangement 1 365 50
Syndrome. 1 365 50

Let’s 0 365 51
assume 0 365 51
for 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
sake 0 365 51
of 0 365 51
argument 0 365 51
that 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
normal 0 365 51
burden 0 365 51
on 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
prosecution 0 365 51
in 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
criminal 0 365 51
case 0 365 51
- 0 365 51
to 0 365 51
prove 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
accused’s 0 365 51
guilt 0 365 51
beyond 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
reasonable 0 365 51
doubt 0 365 51
- 0 365 51
is 0 365 51
not 0 365 51
applicable 0 365 51
regarding 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
charge 0 365 51
against 0 365 51
Judge 0 365 51
Kavanaugh 0 365 51
since 0 365 51
he 0 365 51
is 0 365 51
not 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
defendant 0 365 51
in 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
criminal 0 365 51
trial. 0 365 51

However, 0 365 52
that 0 365 52
should 0 365 52
not 0 365 52
flip 0 365 52
the 0 365 52
burden 0 365 52
of 0 365 52
proof 0 365 52
onto 0 365 52
Judge 0 365 52
Kavanaugh 0 365 52
altogether. 0 365 52

Judge 0 365 53
Kavanaugh 0 365 53
is 0 365 53
being 0 365 53
subjected 0 365 53
to 0 365 53
charges 0 365 53
of 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
criminal 0 365 53
nature 0 365 53
that 0 365 53
could 0 365 53
not 0 365 53
only 0 365 53
deprive 0 365 53
him 0 365 53
of 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
seat 0 365 53
on 0 365 53
the 0 365 53
Supreme 0 365 53
Court 0 365 53
for 0 365 53
which 0 365 53
he 0 365 53
is 0 365 53
otherwise 0 365 53
eminently 0 365 53
qualified. 0 365 53

Ms. 0 365 54
Ford’s 0 365 54
unsubstantiated 0 365 54
accusation 0 365 54
can 0 365 54
completely 1 365 54
destroy 1 365 54
Judge 1 365 54
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 54
life 1 365 54
by 0 365 54
causing 0 365 54
irreparable 0 365 54
damage 0 365 54
to 0 365 54
his 0 365 54
reputation 0 365 54
for 0 365 54
integrity 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
good 0 365 54
character 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
to 0 365 54
his 0 365 54
career, 0 365 54
which 0 365 54
he 0 365 54
has 0 365 54
built 0 365 54
up 0 365 54
during 0 365 54
decades 0 365 54
of 0 365 54
public 0 365 54
service. 0 365 54

His 0 365 55
family’s 0 365 55
lives 0 365 55
have 0 365 55
been 0 365 55
completely 0 365 55
upended. 0 365 55

Placing 0 365 56
the 0 365 56
burden 0 365 56
on 0 365 56
Judge 0 365 56
Kavanaugh 0 365 56
to 0 365 56
prove 0 365 56
that 0 365 56
he 0 365 56
was 0 365 56
not 0 365 56
involved 0 365 56
in 0 365 56
an 0 365 56
uncorroborated 0 365 56
incident 0 365 56
from 0 365 56
years 0 365 56
ago, 0 365 56
about 0 365 56
which 0 365 56
even 0 365 56
his 0 365 56
accuser 0 365 56
does 0 365 56
not 0 365 56
recall 0 365 56
key 0 365 56
details, 0 365 56
turns 1 365 56
the 1 365 56
fundamental 1 365 56
constitutional 1 365 56
principle 1 365 56
of 1 365 56
due 1 365 56
process 1 365 56
upside 1 365 56
down. 1 365 56

Ms. 0 365 57
Ford 0 365 57
should 0 365 57
have 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
burden 0 365 57
to 0 365 57
prove 0 365 57
her 0 365 57
accusations 0 365 57
by 0 365 57
at 0 365 57
least 0 365 57
a 0 365 57
preponderance 0 365 57
of 0 365 57
all 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
evidence 0 365 57
presented. 0 365 57

This 1 365 58
charade 1 365 58
must 0 365 58
come 0 365 58
to 0 365 58
an 0 365 58
end. 0 365 58

No 0 365 59
more 0 365 59
extensions 0 365 59
for 0 365 59
Ms. 0 365 59
Ford 0 365 59
to 0 365 59
come 0 365 59
forward 0 365 59
and 0 365 59
testify. 0 365 59

If 0 365 60
Ms. 0 365 60
Ford 0 365 60
does 0 365 60
not 0 365 60
follow 0 365 60
through 0 365 60
with 0 365 60
her 0 365 60
agreement 0 365 60
to 0 365 60
testify 0 365 60
in 0 365 60
an 0 365 60
open 0 365 60
Senate 0 365 60
Judiciary 0 365 60
Committee 0 365 60
hearing 0 365 60
this 0 365 60
Thursday 0 365 60
and 0 365 60
do 0 365 60
so 0 365 60
upon 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
conditions 0 365 60
set 0 365 60
by 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
committee, 0 365 60
she 0 365 60
should 0 365 60
go 0 365 60
home 0 365 60
while 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
committee 0 365 60
proceeds 0 365 60
to 0 365 60
an 0 365 60
immediate 0 365 60
vote 0 365 60
on 0 365 60
Judge 0 365 60
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 60
nomination. 0 365 60

If 0 365 61
Ms. 0 365 61
Ford 0 365 61
and 0 365 61
Judge 0 365 61
Kavanaugh 0 365 61
do 0 365 61
testify, 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
senators 0 365 61
deciding 0 365 61
on 0 365 61
whether 0 365 61
to 0 365 61
confirm 0 365 61
Judge 0 365 61
Kavanaugh 0 365 61
as 0 365 61
well 0 365 61
as 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
American 0 365 61
public 0 365 61
following 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
testimony 0 365 61
must 0 365 61
remember 0 365 61
one 0 365 61
cardinal 0 365 61
rule. 0 365 61

In 1 365 62
a 1 365 62
nation 1 365 62
guided 1 365 62
by 1 365 62
fairness 1 365 62
and 1 365 62
law, 1 365 62
a 1 365 62
person 1 365 62
is 1 365 62
innocent 1 365 62
until 1 365 62
proven 1 365 62
guilty. 1 365 62

Sadly, 0 365 63
many 0 365 63
of 0 365 63
Judge 1 365 63
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 63
haters 1 365 63
have 0 365 63
thrown 0 365 63
that 0 365 63
rule 0 365 63
aside. 0 365 63

If 0 365 64
Judge 0 365 64
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 64
nomination 0 365 64
is 0 365 64
pulled 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
a 0 365 64
result 0 365 64
of 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
smears 1 365 64
and 0 365 64
character 1 365 64
assassination, 1 365 64
President 0 365 64
Trump 0 365 64
should 0 365 64
immediately 0 365 64
nominate 0 365 64
someone 0 365 64
on 0 365 64
his 0 365 64
short 0 365 64
list 0 365 64
such 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
Amy 0 365 64
Coney 0 365 64
Barrett 0 365 64
and 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
Senate 0 365 64
Republican 0 365 64
majority 0 365 64
should 0 365 64
then 0 365 64
push 0 365 64
through 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
new 0 365 64
nominee’s 0 365 64
confirmation 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
soon 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
possible. 0 365 64

Delay 0 365 64

is 0 365 64

not 0 365 64

an 0 365 64

option. 0 365 64
