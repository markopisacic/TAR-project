Last-Minute 0
Accusations 0

Democrats 0
are 0
pulling 1
out 1
all 1
the 1
stops 1
and 0
enabling 0
salacious 0
last-minute 0
accusations 0
against 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
sink 0
his 0
candidacy. 0

Now 0
that 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
has 0
finally 0
agreed 0
to 0
testify 0
this 0
Thursday 0
at 0
an 0
open 0
hearing 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
regarding 0
her 0
charge 0
that 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
sexually 0
assaulted 0
her 0
at 0
a 0
long-ago 0
high 0
school 0
party, 0
these 0
new 0
charges 0
have 0
suddenly 1
emerged 1
from 1
left 1
field. 1

On 0
Sunday, 0
a 0
former 0
classmate 0
from 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh's 0
time 0
at 0
Yale 0
accused 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
of 0
exposing 0
himself 0
to 0
her 0
at 0
a 0
party. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
has 0
just 0
published 0
an 0
article 0
written 0
by 0
Ronan 0
Farrow 0
and 0
Jane 0
Mayer, 0
based 0
on 0
information 0
that 0
was 0
reportedly 0
sent 0
to 0
at 0
least 0
four 0
Democratic 0
senators. 0

The 0
article 0
recounted 0
a 0
claim 0
by 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez, 0
a 0
Yale 0
classmate 0
of 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s, 0
concerning 0
“a 0
dormitory 0
party 0
gone 0
awry.” 0
As 0
the 0
article 0
acknowledged, 0
however, 0
“her 0
memories 0
contained 0
gaps 0
because 0
she 0
had 0
been 0
drinking 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident.” 0
The 0
article 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
in 0
her 0
initial 0
conversations 0
with 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker, 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez 0
was 0
“reluctant 0
to 0
characterize 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
with 0
certainty.” 0
It 0
was 0
only 0
after 0
“six 0
days 0
of 0
carefully 0
assessing 0
her 0
memories 0
and 0
consulting 0
with 0
her 0
attorney” 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez 0
was 0
suddenly 0
able 0
to 0
pinpoint 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
having 0
committed 0
an 0
unsavory 0
act, 0
even 0
though 0
she 0
admitted 0
being 0
“foggy” 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
article 0
also 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
magazine 0
“has 0
not 0
confirmed 0
with 0
other 0
eyewitnesses 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
present 0
at 0
the 0
party.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
ever-present 0
Michael 0
Avenatti, 0
attorney 0
of 0
porn 0
star 0
Stormy 0
Daniels, 0
tweeted 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
information 0
from 0
anonymous 0
sources 0
that 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
his 0
friend 0
had 0
"targeted" 0
women 0
with 0
drugs 0
and 0
alcohol 0
at 0
parties 0
to 0
facilitate 0
"gang 0
rape." 0

Haters 1
of 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh 1
are 0
turning 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
Senate 0
confirmation 0
of 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
into 0
something 0
worse 1
than 1
a 1
travesty. 1

His 0
opponents 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
have 0
transformed 0
their 0
“advise 0
and 0
consent” 0
function 0
into 0
a 0
campaign 0
of 0
no-holds 0
barred 0
character 1
assassination. 1

While 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
weathers 0
these 0
latest 0
accusations, 0
which 0
he 0
adamantly 0
denies, 0
his 0
real 0
test 0
will 0
be 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
assuming 0
that 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
will 0
follow 0
through 0
on 0
her 0
agreement 0
to 0
testify 0
at 0
an 0
open 0
hearing 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee. 0

Her 0
attorneys 0
stalled 0
for 0
a 0
week 0
before 0
making 0
the 0
announcement 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
would 0
testify 0
despite 0
certain 0
“unresolved” 0
issues. 0

Among 0
the 0
issues 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
attorneys 0
have 0
raised 0
was 0
the 0
refusal 0
of 0
the 0
committee 0
to 0
subpoena 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
purported 0
witnesses, 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
who 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
reportedly 0
claims 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
“who 0
on 0
the 0
Majority 0
side 0
will 0
be 0
asking 0
the 0
questions, 0
whether 0
senators 0
or 0
staff 0
attorneys." 0

A 0
week 0
has 0
already 0
gone 0
by 0
since 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
went 0
public 0
with 0
her 0
story 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
while 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
and 0
her 0
attorneys 0
stalled 0
for 0
time. 0

They 0
raised 0
one 0
procedural 0
issue 0
after 0
another 0
while 0
claiming 0
that 0
the 0
committee 0
majority 0
was 0
“bullying” 0
Ms. 0
Ford. 0

Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Chairman 0
Charles 0
Grassley 0
(R-I) 0
has 0
bent 1
over 1
backwards 1
to 0
accommodate 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
preferred 0
scheduling 0
for 0
her 0
appearance. 0

He 0
extended 0
the 0
deadline 0
several 0
times 0
for 0
her 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
a 0
decision 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
testify 0
at 0
all. 0

He 0
had 0
offered 0
various 0
options 0
for 0
her 0
to 0
testify 0
publicly 0
or 0
privately 0
or 0
to 0
be 0
interviewed 0
by 0
committee 0
staff 0
in 0
her 0
home 0
state 0
of 0
California, 0
whichever 0
setting 0
would 0
make 0
her 0
more 0
comfortable. 0

However, 0
in 0
Senator 0
Grassley’s 0
e-mail 0
thanking 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
for 0
finally 0
agreeing 0
to 0
a 0
time 0
certain 0
for 0
her 0
testimony, 0
Senator 0
Grassley 0
correctly 0
reminded 0
her 0
attorneys 0
that 0
“the 0
committee 0
determines 0
which 0
witnesses 0
to 0
call, 0
how 0
many 0
witnesses 0
to 0
call, 0
and 0
what 0
order 0
to 0
call 0
them 0
and 0
who 0
will 0
question 0
them. 0

These 0
are 0
nonnegotiable.” 0

While 0
the 0
negotiations 0
with 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
attorneys 0
for 0
her 0
testimony 0
were 0
underway, 0
Democrats 0
were 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
latest 0
allegations, 0
ready 1
to 1
pounce 1
as 0
soon 0
as 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
accusation 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
be 0
heard. 0

Some 0
Democrats 0
are 0
already 0
using 0
the 0
Ramirez 0
episode 0
to 0
push 0
anew 0
for 0
a 0
fresh 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
and 0
to 0
postpone 0
Thursday’s 0
scheduled 0
hearing. 0

Ideally, 0
if 0
the 0
Democrats 0
cannot 0
apply 0
enough 0
pressure 0
to 0
force 0
a 0
withdrawal 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
through 0
their 0
relentless 0
campaign 0
of 0
character 1
assassination, 1
they 0
want 0
to 0
push 0
any 0
Senate 0
votes 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections 0
at 0
the 0
earliest. 0

Then 0
they 0
will 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
newly 0
elected 0
senators 0
should 0
be 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
confirmation 0
decision. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
adversaries 0
in 0
the 0
Senate, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
and 0
progressive 0
circles 0
continue 1
to 1
bludgeon 1
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
court 0
of 0
public 0
opinion. 0

All 0
of 0
their 0
stratagems 0
are 0
an 0
obvious 0
attempt 0
to 0
buy 0
time 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
persuade 0
any 0
wavering 0
senators 0
that 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
too 0
tainted 0
by 0
sexual 0
assault 0
charges 0
– 0
whether 0
proven 0
or 0
not 0
- 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

Proof 0
does 0
not 0
matter 0
to 0
those 0
wanting 0
to 0
bring 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
down 0
at 0
any 0
cost. 0

Regarding 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
accusation, 0
they 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
proof 0
so 0
far 0
is 0
non-existent, 0
aside 0
from 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
own 0
assertions 0
contained 0
in 0
her 0
confidential 0
letter 0
given 0
to 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein, 0
the 0
ranking 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
last 0
July, 0
and 0
in 0
her 0
Washington 0
Post 0
interview. 0

While 0
a 0
redacted 0
version 0
of 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
letter 0
has 0
been 0
published, 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
has 0
refused 0
to 0
date 0
to 0
give 0
even 0
Senator 0
Grassley 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
completely 0
unredacted 0
version. 0

The 0
FBI 0
has 0
already 0
conducted 0
6 0
background 0
checks, 0
no 0
federal 0
crime 0
is 0
alleged, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
forensic 0
evidence 0
to 0
investigate 0
after 0
30 0
years 0
at 0
a 0
site 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
cannot 0
even 0
identify. 0

What 1
we 1
do 1
know 1
so 1
far 1
tends 1
to 1
undercut 1
the 1
credibility 1
of 1
Ms. 1
Ford’s 1
accusation. 1

Ms. 0
Ford 0
cannot 0
corroborate 0
her 0
decades-old 0
charge 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Whatever 1
corroboration 1
Ms. 1
Ford 1
was 1
hoping 1
for 1
from 1
“witnesses” 1
she 1
claimed 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
alleged 1
party 1
is 1
non-existent. 1

The 0
individuals 0
she 0
reportedly 0
named 0
in 0
her 0
unredacted 0
confidential 0
letter 0
given 0
to 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
have 0
either 0
denied 0
being 0
at 0
such 0
a 0
party 0
or 0
do 0
not 0
recollect 0
what 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
has 0
alleged. 0

Moreover, 0
by 0
her 0
own 0
admission 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
“said 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
some 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
incident.” 0
She 0
does 0
not 0
remember, 0
for 0
example, 0
where 0
it 0
happened, 0
how 0
the 0
party 0
came 0
together 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
or 0
how 0
she 0
got 0
home 0
after 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident. 0

She 0
believes 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
occurred 0
during 0
the 0
summer 0
of 0
1982, 0
but 0
reportedly 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
more 0
precise 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
or 0
even 0
the 0
month 0
of 0
the 0
party. 0

Afraid 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
sexual 0
assault 0
allegation 0
could 0
be 0
readily 0
challenged 0
and 0
anxious 0
to 0
establish 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
pattern 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
beyond 0
this 0
single 0
alleged 0
incident, 0
the 1
Kavanaugh 1
haters 1
have 0
latched 0
onto 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez’s 0
story. 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
published 0
an 0
op-ed 0
column 0
last 0
week 0
by 0
a 0
psychiatrist, 0
Richard 0
A. 0
Friedman, 0
who 0
cited 0
neurological 0
science 0
to 0
conclude 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
claim 0
that 0
she 0
has 0
“a 0
vivid 0
memory 0
of 0
an 0
attack 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
15” 0
is 0
“credible.” 0
The 0
reason, 0
he 0
wrote, 0
is 0
that 0
“memories 0
formed 0
under 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
intense 0
emotion 0
— 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
feelings 0
that 0
accompany 0
a 0
sexual 0
assault 0
— 0
are 0
indelible 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
that 0
memories 0
of 0
a 0
routine 0
day 0
are 0
not.” 0
The 1
only 1
problem 1
with 1
Dr. 1
Friedman’s 1
thesis 1
is 1
that 1
Ms. 1
Ford 1
has 1
apparently 1
forgotten 1
such 1
key 1
details 1
surrounding 1
the 1
alleged 1
sexual 1
assault 1
as 1
when 1
and 1
where 1
it 1
happened 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
got 1
home. 1

Moreover, 0
when 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
finally 0
told 0
someone 0
about 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
any 0
detail 0
some 0
30 0
years 0
later 0
in 0
2012, 0
during 0
a 0
couples 0
therapy 0
session 0
with 0
her 0
husband, 0
she 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
specifically, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
therapist’s 0
notes 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
had 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
in 0
connection 0
with 0
her 0
interview. 0

The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
therapist’s 0
notes 0
it 0
reviewed 0
“do 0
not 0
mention 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
name 0
but 0
say 0
she 0
reported 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
attacked 0
by 0
students 0
‘from 0
an 0
elitist 1
boys’ 1
school’ 1
who 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
become 0
‘highly 0
respected 0
and 0
high-ranking 0
members 0
of 0
society 0
in 0
Washington.’” 0

Ms. 0
Ramirez’s 0
story 0
is 0
even 0
less 0
credible. 0

It 0
took 0
an 0
attorney 0
and 0
six 0
days 0
of 0
very 0
belated 0
reflection 0
to 0
help 0
revive 0
her 0
memory 0
of 0
an 0
incident 0
she 0
claimed 0
happened 0
while 0
she 0
herself 0
was 0
very 0
drunk. 0

Senator 0
Mazie 0
Hirono 0
(D-Hawaii), 0
one 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
fiercest 0
critics 0
who 0
told 0
men 0
to 0
“shut 0
up” 0
regarding 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
allegations, 0
said 0
she 1
doubts 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
credibility 1
because 1
of 1
“how 1
he 1
approaches 1
his 1
cases.” 1
Aside 0
from 0
mischaracterizing 0
the 0
constitutional 0
textualist 0
reasoning 0
underlying 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
opinions, 0
she 0
is 0
saying 0
that 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
believe 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
denial 0
of 0
the 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
allegations 0
lodged 0
against 0
him 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
opinions 0
he 0
wrote 0
that 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
like. 0

Such 0
circular 0
“reasoning” 0
would 0
be 0
amusing 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
not 0
so 0
emblematic 0
of 0
what 0
one 0
writer 0
called 0
“Kavanaugh 1
Derangement 1
Syndrome." 1

Senator 0
Kirsten 0
Gillibrand 0
(D-N.Y.) 0
is 0
also 0
suffering 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
syndrome. 0

She 0
said 0
Thursday 0
regarding 0
Ms. 0
Ford: 0
"I 0
believe 1
her 1
because 1
she 1
is 1
telling 1
the 1
truth 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
it 1
by 1
her 1
story." 1

Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
supporters 0
are 0
exploiting 0
the 0
“Me 1
Too” 1
movement 1
to 0
declare 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
guilty 0
simply 1
because 1
Ms. 1
Ford 1
is 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
has 1
made 1
what 1
they 1
call, 1
without 1
any 1
corroborating 1
evidence 1
to 1
date, 1
a 1
“credible” 1
charge. 1

The 0
same 0
would 0
presumably 0
be 0
the 0
case 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez. 0

They 0
argue 0
that 0
since 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
criminal 0
judicial 0
trial, 0
but 0
rather 0
a 0
legislative 0
hearing 0
for 0
confirmation 0
of 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee, 0
the 0
normal 0
burden 0
of 0
proof 0
shouldered 0
by 0
the 0
accuser 0
should 0
not 0
apply. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
should 0
have 0
to 0
prove 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
guilty, 0
they 0
are 0
in 0
effect 0
insisting. 0

This 0
is 0
another 0
case 0
of 0
Kavanaugh 1
Derangement 1
Syndrome. 1

Let’s 0
assume 0
for 0
the 0
sake 0
of 0
argument 0
that 0
the 0
normal 0
burden 0
on 0
the 0
prosecution 0
in 0
a 0
criminal 0
case 0
- 0
to 0
prove 0
the 0
accused’s 0
guilt 0
beyond 0
a 0
reasonable 0
doubt 0
- 0
is 0
not 0
applicable 0
regarding 0
the 0
charge 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
since 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
defendant 0
in 0
a 0
criminal 0
trial. 0

However, 0
that 0
should 0
not 0
flip 0
the 0
burden 0
of 0
proof 0
onto 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
altogether. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
being 0
subjected 0
to 0
charges 0
of 0
a 0
criminal 0
nature 0
that 0
could 0
not 0
only 0
deprive 0
him 0
of 0
a 0
seat 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
for 0
which 0
he 0
is 0
otherwise 0
eminently 0
qualified. 0

Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
unsubstantiated 0
accusation 0
can 0
completely 1
destroy 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
life 1
by 0
causing 0
irreparable 0
damage 0
to 0
his 0
reputation 0
for 0
integrity 0
and 0
good 0
character 0
and 0
to 0
his 0
career, 0
which 0
he 0
has 0
built 0
up 0
during 0
decades 0
of 0
public 0
service. 0

His 0
family’s 0
lives 0
have 0
been 0
completely 0
upended. 0

Placing 0
the 0
burden 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
prove 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
uncorroborated 0
incident 0
from 0
years 0
ago, 0
about 0
which 0
even 0
his 0
accuser 0
does 0
not 0
recall 0
key 0
details, 0
turns 1
the 1
fundamental 1
constitutional 1
principle 1
of 1
due 1
process 1
upside 1
down. 1

Ms. 0
Ford 0
should 0
have 0
the 0
burden 0
to 0
prove 0
her 0
accusations 0
by 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
preponderance 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
evidence 0
presented. 0

This 1
charade 1
must 0
come 0
to 0
an 0
end. 0

No 0
more 0
extensions 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
and 0
testify. 0

If 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
does 0
not 0
follow 0
through 0
with 0
her 0
agreement 0
to 0
testify 0
in 0
an 0
open 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
hearing 0
this 0
Thursday 0
and 0
do 0
so 0
upon 0
the 0
conditions 0
set 0
by 0
the 0
committee, 0
she 0
should 0
go 0
home 0
while 0
the 0
committee 0
proceeds 0
to 0
an 0
immediate 0
vote 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination. 0

If 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
and 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
do 0
testify, 0
the 0
senators 0
deciding 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
confirm 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
American 0
public 0
following 0
the 0
testimony 0
must 0
remember 0
one 0
cardinal 0
rule. 0

In 1
a 1
nation 1
guided 1
by 1
fairness 1
and 1
law, 1
a 1
person 1
is 1
innocent 1
until 1
proven 1
guilty. 1

Sadly, 0
many 0
of 0
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
haters 1
have 0
thrown 0
that 0
rule 0
aside. 0

If 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
is 0
pulled 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
smears 1
and 0
character 1
assassination, 1
President 0
Trump 0
should 0
immediately 0
nominate 0
someone 0
on 0
his 0
short 0
list 0
such 0
as 0
Amy 0
Coney 0
Barrett 0
and 0
the 0
Senate 0
Republican 0
majority 0
should 0
then 0
push 0
through 0
the 0
new 0
nominee’s 0
confirmation 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible. 0

Delay 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
option. 0
