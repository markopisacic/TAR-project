letter 0
to 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
praised 0
their 0
episcopal 0
guidelines 0
allowing 0
divorced 0

Catholics 0
to 0
receive 0
Holy 0

in 0

cases 0

living 0

state 0
of 0

sin. 0

If 0
papal 0
clarification 0
was 0
ever 0
needed 0
on 0
the 0
long-debated 0
issue 0
of 0
the 0
intended 0
meaning 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
chapter 0
VIII, 0
such 0
clarification 0
has 0
now 0
been 0
provided 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
at 0
large. 0

Concerning 0
these 0
guidelines 0
that 0
allow 0
"the 0
possibility 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist" 0
in 0
"complex 0
circumstances" 0
where 0
"limitations 0
that 0
lessen 0
the 0
responsibility 0
and 0
guilt" 0
permit 0
adulterous 0
couples 0
to 0
continue 0
in 0
adultery, 0
the 0
pope 0
said 0
in 0
his 0
letter: 0

"The 1
document 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
completely 1
explains 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
chapter 1
VIII 1
of 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia. 1

There 1
are 1
no 1
other 1
interpretations." 1

Until 0
now, 0
the 0
pope's 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
Argentinian 0
bishops 0
had 0
been 0
considered 0
a 0
private 0
letter 0
with 0
no 0
binding 0
force, 0
whereas 0
AAS 0
has 0
now 0
elevated 0
Pope 0
Francis' 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
magisterial 0
status 0
of 0
an 0
"Apostolic 0
Letter," 0
while 0
including 0
a 0
special 0
rescript 0
as 0
an 0
addendum 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Pietro 0
Parolin, 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

The 0
rescript 0
declares 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
expressly 0
intends 0
both 0
documents—the 0
papal 0
letter 0
and 0
the 0
episcopal 0
guidelines—to 0
bear 0
the 0
character 0
of 0
his 0
"authentic 0
Magisterium," 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
has 0
personally 0
ordered 0
their 0
publication 0
in 0
AAS 0
and 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website. 0

Hence 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
VIII, 0
which 0
proposes 0
that 0
people 0
living 0
in 0
adultery 0
can 0
be 0
guiltless 0
and 0
thus 0
be 0
admitted 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Confession 0
and 0
Communion 0
when 0
"concrete 0
circumstances" 0
make 0
it 0
difficult 0
to 0
renounce 0
their 0
adulterous 0
state, 0
is 0
now 0
declared 0
"magisterial" 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
is 0
that 0
heresy 0
or 0
sacrilege 0
can 0
never 0
be 0
declared 0
magisterial, 0
so 0
that 0
if 0
it 0
is, 0
it 0
not 0
only 0
has 0
no 0
binding 0
force, 0
but 0
the 0
faithful 0
are 0
obliged 0
to 0
resist 0
and 0
refute 0
such 0
a 0
declaration. 0

St. 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas 0
says 0
in 0
his 0
Summa 0
Theologiae: 0
"If 0
the 0
faith 0
were 0
endangered, 0
a 0
subject 0
ought 0
to 0
rebuke 0
his 0
prelate 0
[pope] 0
even 0
publicly." 0

The 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
latest 0
promulgation 0
is 0
counter-magisterial, 0
but 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
his 0
right-hand 0
man 0
now 0
feel 0
they 0
have 0
enough 0
support 0
from 0
the 0
dissenting 0
left 0
that 0
enables 0
them 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
with 0
it. 0

Cardinal 0
Parolin's 0
rescript 0
on 0
the 0
papal 0
and 0
episcopal 0
documents 0
reads 0
as 0
follows: 0

Rescript 0
"from 0
an 0
Audience 0
with 0
His 0
Holiness" 0

The 0
Supreme 0
Pontiff 0
decreed 0
that 0
the 0
two 0
preceding 0
documents 0
be 0
promulgated 0
through 0
publication 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website 0
and 0
in 0
Acta 0
Apostolicae 0
Sedis, 0
as 0
authentic 0
Magisterium. 0

From 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Palace, 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
June 0
5 0
in 0
the 0
year 0
2017 0

Pietro 0
Card. 0

Parolin 0

Secretary 0
of 0
State 0

The 0
Catholic 0
Encyclopedia 0
defines 0
a 0
papal 0
rescript 0
as 0
follows: 0
"Rescripts 0
are 0
responses 0
of 0
the 0
pope 0
or 0
a 0
Sacred 0
Congregation, 0
in 0
writing, 0
to 0
queries 0
or 0
petitions 0
of 0
individuals. 0

Some 0
rescripts 0
concern 0
the 0
granting 0
of 0
favors; 0
others 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
justice, 0
e.g. 0

the 0
interpretation 0
of 0
a 0
law." 0

It 0
appears 0
then 0
that 0
Parolin's 0
rescript 0
constitutes 0
a 0
direct 0
reply 0
to 0
the 0
dubia 0
of 0
the 0
Four 0
Cardinals. 0

Pope 0
Francis' 0
praise 0
of 0
the 0
episcopal 0
guidelines 0
clearly 0
answers 0
the 0
cardinals' 0
query 0
concerning 0
his 0
intention 0
in 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
VIII, 0
so 0
will 0
Cardinals 0
Brandmuller 0
and 0
Burke 0
now 0
proceed 0
to 0
issue 0
the 0
formal 0
correction 0
of 0
it? 0

As 0
reported 0
in 0
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope—a 0
remarkable 0
new 0
book 0
which 0
provides 0
an 0
inside 0
look 0
at 0
the 1
most 1
tyrannical 1
and 1
unprincipled 1
papacy 1
of 1
recent 1
history—English 1
Cardinal 0
Cormac 0
Murphy 0
O’Connor 0
who 0
was 0
largely 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
vote 0
canvassing 0
behind 0
Francis' 0
election 0
told 0
journalist 0
Paul 0
Valley 0
in 0
2013, 0
"Four 0
years 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
change 0
things." 0

Each 0
day, 0
we 0
see 0
new 0
evidence 0
that 0
this 0
might 0
have 0
been 0
a 1
gross 1
understatement. 1

We 0
shouldn't 0
rule 0
out 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
Francis 0
may 0
come 0
forward 0
one 0
day 0
and 0
declare 0
"ex-cathedra" 0
that 0
the 0
interpretation 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
VIII, 0
as 0
now 0
taught 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See, 0
is 0
promulgated 0
as 0
"extraordinary 0
magisterium." 0

Should 0
this 0
happen, 0
the 1
Mystical 1
Body 1
would 1
then 1
be 1
without 1
its 1
head. 1

In 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
Catholic 0
World 0
Report 0
(CWR) 0
in 0
December 0
2016, 0
Cardinal 0
Raymond 0
Burke, 0
who 0
is 0
presently 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura, 0
said 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
pope 0
were 0
to 0
"formally 0
profess 0
heresy 0
he 0
would 0
cease, 0
by 0
that 0
act, 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
Pope." 0

Burke 0
was 0
reiterating 0
Church 0
teaching, 0
as 0
expressed 0
by 0
famed 0
canonist 0
Franz 0
Wernz 0
in 0
his 0
Ius 0
Canonicum: 0
"In 0
sum, 0
it 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
said 0
clearly 0
that 0
a 0
[publicly] 0
heretical 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
loses 0
his 0
power 0
upon 0
the 0
very 0
fact." 0
