Julian 0
Assange 0

During 0
World 0
War 0
II 0
Cardinal 0
Jozsef 0
Mindszenty 0
was 0
a 0
huge 0
critic 0
of 0
fascism 0
and 0
wound 0
up 0
in 0
prison. 0

In 0
Oct. 0
1945 0
he 0
became 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Hungary 0
and 0
spoke 0
out 0
just 0
as 0
strongly 0
against 0
Communist 0
oppression. 0

He 0
wound 0
up 0
back 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
eight 0
more 0
years, 0
including 0
long 0
periods 0
of 0
solitary 0
confinement 0
and 0
endured 0
other 0
forms 0
of 0
torture. 0

In 0
1949 0
he 0
was 0
sentenced 0
to 0
life 0
in 0
a 1
show 1
trial 1
that 0
generated 1
worldwide 1
condemnation. 1

Two 0
weeks 0
after 0
the 0
trial 0
began 0
in 0
early 0
1949, 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
(having 0
failed 0
to 0
speak 0
out 0
forcefully 0
against 0
the 0
Third 0
Reich) 0
did 0
summon 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
condemn 0
what 0
was 0
happening 0
to 0
Mindszenty. 0

Pius 0
excommunicated 0
everyone 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
Mindszenty 0
trial. 0

Then, 0
addressing 0
a 0
huge 0
crowd 0
on 0
St. 0
Peter’s 0
Square, 0
he 0
asked, 0
“Do 1
you 1
want 1
a 1
Church 1
that 1
remains 1
silent 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
speak 1
… 1
a 1
Church 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
condemn 1
the 1
suppression 1
of 1
conscience 1
and 1
does 1
not 1
stand 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
just 1
liberty 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
… 1
a 1
Church 1
that 1
locks 1
herself 1
up 1
within 1
the 1
four 1
walls 1
of 1
her 1
temple 1
in 1
unseemly 1
sycophancy 1
…?” 0

When 0
the 0
Hungarian 0
revolution 0
broke 0
out 0
in 0
1956, 0
Mindszenty 0
was 0
freed, 0
but 0
only 0
for 0
four 0
days. 0

When 0
Soviet 0
tanks 0
rolled 0
back 0
into 0
Budapest, 0
he 0
fled 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
embassy 0
and 0
was 0
given 0
immediate 0
asylum 0
by 0
President 0
Eisenhower. 0

Fourth 1

on 1
Life 1
Support 1

In 0
2010, 0
while 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
a 0
free 0
man, 0
the 0
Sam 0
Adams 0
Associates 0
for 0
Integrity 0
gave 0
its 0
annual 0
award 0
to 0
Assange. 0

The 0
citation 0
read: 0

“It 0
seems 0
altogether 0
fitting 0
and 0
proper 0
that 0
this 0
year’s 0
award 0
be 0
presented 0
in 0
London, 0
where 0
Edmund 0
Burke 0
coined 0
the 0
expression 0
“Fourth 0
Estate.” 0
Comparing 0
the 0
function 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
three 0
Houses 0
then 0
in 0
Parliament, 0
Burke 0
said: 0
“…but 0
in 0
the 0
Reporters 0
Gallery 0
yonder, 0
there 0
sits 0
a 1
Fourth 1
Estate 1
more 1
important 1
far 1
then 1
they 1
all.” 1
The 0
year 0
was 0
1787—the 0
year 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Constitution 0
was 0
adopted. 0

The 0
First 0
Amendment, 0
approved 0
four 0
years 0
later, 0
aimed 0
at 0
ensuring 0
that 0
the 0
press 0
would 0
be 0
free 0
of 0
government 0
interference. 0

That 0
was 0
then. 0

With 0
the 0
Fourth 1
Estate 1
now 1
on 1
life 1
support, 1
there 0
is 0
a 0
high 0
premium 0
on 0
the 0
fledgling 0
Fifth 0
Estate, 0
which 0
uses 0
the 0
ether 0
and 0
is 0
not 0
susceptible 0
of 0
government 0
or 0
corporation 0
control. 0

Small 1
wonder 1
that 0
governments 0
with 0
lots 0
to 0
hide 0
feel 0
very 0
threatened. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
said: 0
“You 0
shall 0
know 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
the 0
truth 0
shall 0
set 0
you 0
free.” 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
helping 0
make 0
that 0
possible 0
by 0
publishing 0
documents 0
that 0
do 0
not 0
lie. 0

Last 0
spring, 0
when 0
we 0
chose 0
WikiLeaks 0
and 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
for 0
this 0
award, 0
Julian 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
accept 0
only 0
“on 0
behalf 0
or 0
our 0
sources, 0
without 0
which 0
WikiLeaks’ 0
contributions 0
are 0
of 0
no 0
significance.” 0
We 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
if 0
Pvt. 0

Bradley 0
Manning 0
gave 0
WikiLeaks 0
the 0
gun-barrel 0
video 0
of 0
July 0
12, 0
2007 0
called 0
“Collateral 0
Murder.” 0
Whoever 0
did 0
provide 0
that 0
graphic 0
footage, 0
showing 0
the 1
brutality 1
of 1
the 1
celebrated 1
“surge” 1
in 1
Iraq, 1
was 0
certainly 0
far 1
more 1
a 1
patriot 1
than 0
the 1
“mainstream” 1
journalist 1
embedded 0
in 0
that 0
same 0
Army 0
unit. 0

He 0
suppressed 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
Baghdad 0
that 0
day, 0
dismissed 0
it 0
as 0
simply 0
“one 1
bad 1
day 1
in 1
a 1
surge 1
that 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
such 1
days,” 1
and 0
then 0
had 1
the 1
temerity 1
to 1
lavish 1
praise 1
on 0
the 0
unit 0
in 0
a 0
book 0
he 0
called 0
“The 0
Good 0
Soldiers.” 0
Julian 0
is 0
right 0
to 0
emphasize 0
that 0
the 0
world 0
is 0
deeply 0
indebted 0
to 0
patriotic 1
truth-tellers 1
like 0
the 0
sources 0
who 0
provided 0
the 0
gun-barrel 0
footage 0
and 0
the 0
many 0
documents 0
on 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
Iraq 0
to 0
WikiLeaks. 0

We 0
hope 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
honor 0
them 0
in 0
person 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

Today 0
we 0
honor 0
WikiLeaks, 0
and 0
one 0
of 0
its 0
leaders, 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
for 0
their 0
ingenuity 0
in 0
creating 0
a 0
new 0
highway 0
by 0
which 0
important 0
documentary 0
evidence 0
can 0
make 0
its 0
way, 0
quickly 0
and 0
confidentially, 0
through 0
the 0
ether 0
and 0
into 0
our 0
in-boxes. 0

Long 1
live 1
the 1
Fifth 1
Estate!” 1

Eventually 0
a 0
compromise 0
was 0
found 0
in 0
1971 0
when 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
VI 0
lifted 0
the 0
excommunications 0
and 0
Mindszenty 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
U.S. 0
embassy. 0

Can 0
such 0
a 0
diplomatic 0
solution 0
be 0
found 0
to 0
free 0
Assange? 0

It 0
is 0
looking 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
unlikely 0
with 0
each 0
passing 0
year. 0
