Note: 0
This 0
is 0
probably 0
a 0
reason 0
why 0
reporters 0
Laura 0
Loomer 0
and 0
Mike 0
Tokes 0
were 0
barred 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
presser. 0

They 0
would 0
have 0
posed 0
real 0
genuine 0
questions 0
of 0
Sheriff 0
Lombardo 0
and 0
forced 0
him 0
to 0
stumble 0
all 0
over 0
himself 0
in 0
answering 0
them. 0

The 0
words 0
“conspiracy 1
theorists” 1
are 0
being 0
bandied 0
about. 0

Are 1
they 1
for 1
real? 1

A 0
well-coordinated, 0
meticulously 0
planned 0
attack 0
on 0
concertgoers 0
leads 0
to 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
58 0
Americans 0
at 0
a 0
country 0
music 0
festival 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas, 0
with 0
over 0
500 0
injured, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
explanation 0
or 0
motive. 0

Do 1
the 1
FBI 1
and 1
law 1
enforcement 1
think 1
people 1
won’t 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
or 1
speculate 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
happened? 1

Are 1
they 1
for 1
real? 1

Further, 1
the 1
FBI 1
insists 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
jihad 1
motive, 1
while 1
saying 1
they 1
don’t 1
know 1
his 1
motive. 1

How 0
can 0
they 0
possibly 0
hold 0
those 0
two 0
contradictory 0
ideas 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time? 0

The 0
sheriff, 0
alluding 0
to 0
allegations 0
of 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
between 0
his 0
department, 0
the 0
F.B.I., 0
and 0
MGM 0
— 0
supposedly 0
in 0
an 0
effort 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
legal 0
case 0
— 0
said, 0
“there 0
is 0
no 0
conspiracy.” 0

William 0
Jacobson 0
explains 0
the 0
latest 0
“revise” 0
by 0
the 0
authorities 0

the 0
now 0
infamously 0
botched 0

Legal 0
Insurrection 0

Police 0

and 0
hotel 0
still 0
don’t 0
agree 0
on 0
some 0
details. 0

I 0
realize 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
heat 0
of 0
a 0
shooting, 0
particularly 0
a 0
mass 0
shooting, 0
it 0
may 0
take 0
some 0
time 0
for 0
a 0
precise 0
timeline 0
to 0
develop. 0

But 0
it 0
didn’t 0
take 0
very 0
long 0
for 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
to 0
release 0
a 0
precise 0
timeline. 0

The 0
initial 0
timeline 0
was 0
that 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
shooting 0
stopped 0
when, 0
approximately 0
6 0
minutes 0
after 0
he 0
started, 0
he 0
was 0
interrupted 0
by 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
from 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
hotel. 0

Paddock 0
then 0
turned 0
his 0
fire 0
into 0
the 0
hallway, 0
firing 0
some 0
200 0
bullets, 0
and 0
after 0
that 0
the 0
shooting 0
stopped 0
as 0
police 0
arrived. 0

That 0
was 0
Version 0
No. 0

1. 0

Some 0
days 0
later, 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
backed 0
away 0
from 0
that 0
timeline, 0
and 0
stated 0
that 0
the 0
security 0
guard 0
actually 0
arrived 0
6 0
minutes 0
before 0
Paddock 0
started 0
shooting 0
into 0
the 0
crowd 0
32 0
stories 0
below 0
him. 0

That 1
raised 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
question, 1
including 0
why 0
no 0
one 0
called 0
911 0
after 0
what 0
must 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
loud 0
volley 0
of 0
shots 0
in 0
a 0
hotel 0
hallway. 0

That 0
was 0
Version 0
No. 0

But 0
now 0
that 0
is 0
disputed, 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
said 0
Friday 0
that 0
the 0
gunman 0
who 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
a 0
country 0
music 0
festival 0
far 0
below 0
his 0
hotel 0
suite 0
did 0
not 0
shoot 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
that 0
rampage, 0
contradicting 1
a 1
timeline 1
they 1
had 1
offered 1
earlier 1
this 1
week…. 1

The 0
confusion 0
began 0
Monday 0
when 0
police 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
gunman 0
fired 0
at 0
the 0
hotel 0
security 0
guard, 0
Jesus 0
Campos, 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began, 0
not 0
during 0
the 0
massacre 0
as 0
they 0
had 0
said. 0

Lombardo 0
also 0
said 0
police 0
had 0
hunted 0
for 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
gunfire 0
and 0
that 0
officers 0
responding 0
to 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
floor 0
were 0
unaware 0
that 0
a 0
guard 0
was 0
shot 0
until 0
they 0
arrived 0
there, 0
at 0
which 0
point 0
the 0
shooting 0
rampage 0
had 0
ended. 0

MGM 0
Resorts 0
pushed 0
back 0
on 0
this 0
account, 0
first 0
saying 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
unspecified 0
inaccuracies 0
and 0
then, 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
releasing 0
a 0
statement 0
directly 0
contradicting 0
parts 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
police 0
had 0
said…. 0

Lombardo 0
had 0
said 0
Monday 0
that 0
Campos, 0
the 0
guard, 0
was 0
shot 0
at 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began 0
at 0
10:05 0
p.m. 0

This 0
six-minute 0
gap 0
relayed 0
by 0
Lombardo 0
left 0
uncertain 0
whether 0
there 0
was 0
any 0
lag 0
in 0
alerting 0
police 0
to 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
gunfire 0
during 0
critical 0
moments. 0

Police 0
said 0
officers 0
arrived 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
at 0
10:17 0
p.m., 0
two 0
minutes 0
after 0
Paddock 0
had 0
stopped 0
firing. 0

MGM, 0
though, 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
“confident” 0
that 0
the 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
time 0
was 0
inaccurate 0
and 0
“was 0
derived 0
from 0
a 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
report 0
manually 0
created 0
after 0
the 0
fact 0
without 0
the 0
benefit 0
of 0
information 0
we 0
now 0
have.” 0
The 0
company 0
also 0
disputed 0
the 0
suggestion 0
of 0
a 0
lag, 0
saying 0
the 0
shooting 0
rampage 0
began 0
within 0
a 0
minute 0
of 0
Campos 0
reporting 0
his 0
injury 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor. 0

On 0
Friday, 0
Lombardo 0
effectively 0
agreed 0
with 0
the 0
company’s 0
statement, 0
though 0
he 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
time 0
he 0
had 0
offered 0
four 0
days 0
earlier 0
“wasn’t 0
inaccurate 0
when 0
I 0
provided 0
it.” 0
Lombardo 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
told 0
this 0
time 0
had 0
been 0
written 0
by 0
someone 0
in 0
a 0
security 0
log. 0

Upon 0
investigation, 0
Lombardo 0
said, 0
police 0
learned 0
that 0
Campos 0
first 0
encountered 0
a 0
barricaded 0
door 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
at 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0

The 0
guard 0
was 0
eventually 0
fired 0
upon 0
by 0
Paddock 0
“in 0
close 0
proximity 0
to” 0
10:05 0
p.m., 0
when 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began, 0
Lombardo 0
continued. 0

Clear, 0
right? 0

Not 0
so 0
fast, 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
hotel 0
still 0
have 0
disagreement 0
over 0
important 0
details, 0
such 0
as 0
when 0
police 0
arrived 0
relative 0
to 0
Paddock’s 0
shooting 0
at 0
the 0
crowd: 0
An 0
enormous, 0
important 0
discrepancy 0
has 0
emerged 0
over 0
what 0
happened 0
during 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
massacre: 0
When 0
did 0
police 0
arrive 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
where 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
was 0
firing 0
his 0
deadly 0
fusillade 0
onto 0
concertgoers 0
below? 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
say 0
they 0
didn’t 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
floor 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
shooting 0
was 0
over. 0

But 0
MGM 0
Resorts 0
International, 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
Mandalay 0
Bay, 0
says 0
police 0
officers 0
were 0
there 0
shortly 0
after 0
the 0
shooting 0
began, 0
responding 0
to 0
a 0
report 0
of 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
being 0
shot. 0

The 0
discrepancy 0
could 0
raise 0
questions 0
about 0
whether 0
police 0
might 0
have 0
taken 0
steps 0
to 0
intervene 0
while 0
Paddock 0
was 0
launching 0
his 0
devastating 0
10-minute 0
onslaught…. 0

… 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
inquiries 0
about 0
when 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
notified 0
police 0
of 0
the 0
Campos 0
shooting, 0
MGM 0
Resorts 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
that 0
was 0
unequivocal: 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
officers 0
accompanied 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
to 0
the 0
Campos 0
shooting 0
and 0
“immediately 0
responded.” 0
MGM 0
said 0
that 0
“Metro 0
officers 0
were 0
together 0
with 0
armed 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
officers 0
in 0
the 0
building 0
when 0
Campos 0
first 0
reported 0
that 0
shots 0
were 0
fired 0
over 0
the 0
radio. 0

These 0
Metro 0
officers 0
and 0
armed 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
officers 0
immediately 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor.” 0
The 0
statement 0
says 0
MGM 0
believes 0
Paddock 0
began 0
firing 0
out 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
his 0
room 0
within 0
40 0
seconds 0
of 0
Campos 0
reporting 0
his 0
shooting, 0
and 0
Lombardo 0
said 0
Friday, 0
“I 0
agree 0
with 0
the 0
statement.” 0
These 1
discrepancies 1
on 1
basic 1
facts 1
are 1
feeding 1
conspiracy 1
theories. 1

As 0
to 0
Paddock’s 0
motive, 0
still 0
nothing 0
from 0
the 0
investigation. 0
