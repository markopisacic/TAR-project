Ms. 0

“It’s 1
absurd,” 1
Ms. 0

said 0
Wednesday 0
on 0
Fox 0
News. 0

“Not 0
one 0
Democrat 0
would 0
look 0
at 0
my 0
deposition 0
with 0
the 0
independent 0
counsel. 0

Oh 1
my 1
gosh, 1
they 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
about 0
it.” 0
She 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
discrepancy 1
between 1
Democratic 1
lack 1
of 1
interest 1
in 1
her 1
case 1
and 1
the 1
party’s 1
outrage 1
over 1

of 1
sexual 1
assault 1
leveled 1
last 1
week 1
against 1
Mr. 1
Kavanaugh. 1

“Oh, 0
it 0
makes 0
me 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
1999, 0
when 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein, 0
along 0
with 0
every 0
other 0
Democrat, 0
refused 0
to 0
read 0
my 0
deposition 0

said 0
Ms. 0
Broaddrick 0
told 0
Fox’s 0
Laura 0
Ingraham 0
on 0
Monday. 0

“They 0
would 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0

That 0
shows 0
you 0
the 0
difference 0
in 0
the 0
double 0
standard 0
that 0
existed 0
back 0
then 0
and 0
still 0
does 0
today.” 0
Ms. 0
Broaddrick 0
has 0
also 0
lashed 1
out 1
at 0
Sen. 0
Dick 0
Durbin, 0
Illinois 0
Democrat, 0
who 0
voted 0
not 0
guilty 0
on 0
the 0

as 0
did 0
Ms. 0
Feinstein 0
and 0
Sen. 0
Patty 0
Murray, 0
Washington 0
Democrat. 0

“You 0

at 0

Clinton’s 0
impeachment,” 0
she 0
tweeted. 0

“You 1
didn’t 1
give 1
a 1
damn 1
back 1
then. 1

You, 1
Dicky 1
Durban 1
[sic], 1
are 1
a 1
complete 1
FRAUD.” 1
Ms. 0
Broaddrick 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
if 1

want 1
the 1
FBI 1
to 1
investigate 1
the 1
36-year-old 1
accusations 1
against 1
Mr. 1
Kavanaugh, 1
they 1
should 1
reopen 1
her 1
40-year-old 1
case, 1
too. 1

If 1
you 1
want 1
the 1
FBI 1
to 1
go 1
back 1
that 1
far 1
@[email 1

to 1
investigate 1
Ford’s 1
allegations…. 1

let’s 1
investigate 1
my 1
RAPE 1
allegations 1
against 1
Bill 1
Clinton, 1
too. 1

Seems 0
only 0
fair. 0

She 0
has 0
long 0
accused 0
Mr. 0
Clinton 0
of 0
raping 0
her 0
a 0
motel 0
room 0
in 0
1978 0
in 0
Little 0
Rock, 0
when 0
he 0

attorney 0
general. 0

“Go 0
back 0
that 0
far, 0
let’s 0
investigate 0
my 0
situation,” 0
she 0
said 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“Why 0
not? 0

Everybody 0
says 0
well 0
it 0
was 0
litigated 0
and 0
adjudicated—my 0
case 0
was 0
never 0
litigated, 0
it 0
was 0
never 0
adjudicated. 0

It 0
never 0
went 0
to 0
court. 0

I 0
was 0
never 1
discredited 0

in 0

The 0

a 0

“During 0

I’ve 1
found 1
every 1

piece 1
of 1
information 1
from 0
Dr. 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
eminently 0
credible, 0

believable,” 0
tweeted 0
Ms. 0
Feinstein 0
on 0
Tuesday. 0

“She 0
knew 0
this 0
