Daniel 0
Greenfield, 0

Journalism 0
Fellow 0
at 0
the 0
Freedom 0
Center, 0
is 0
an 0
investigative 0
journalist 0
and 0
writer 0
focusing 0
on 0
the 0
radical 0
left 0
and 0
Islamic 0
terrorism. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
was 0
founded 0
to 0
study 0
and 0
preserve 0
Jewish 0
history. 0

These 0
days 0
it’s 0
instead 0
partnering 0
with 0
Jewish 0
Voice 0
for 0
Peace: 0
an 0
anti-Israel 1
BDS 1
hate 1
group 1
that 0
defends 0
anti-Semitism 0
and 0
which 0
sponsored 0
talks 0
by 0
an 0
anti-Semite 0
who 0
accused 1
Jews 1
of 1
drinking 1
blood. 1

The 0
fruits 0
of 0
the 0
AJHS 0
and 0
JVP 0
partnership 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
events 0
attacking 0
Israel. 0

Coming 0
up 0
in 0
late 0
October 0
is 0
“The 0
Balfour 0
Declaration: 0
Support 0
for 0
a 0
Jewish 0
Homeland 0
or 0
Jewish 0
State?” 0

The 0
two 0
speakers 0
are 0
Robert 0
Herbst, 0
the 0
coordinator 0
of 0
the 0
Westchester 0
chapter 0
of 0
JVP, 0
and 0
Jonathan 0
Kuttab, 0
who 0
advocates 0
a 0
one-state 0
solution 0
for 0
eliminating 0
Israel. 0

He 0
had 0
tweeted, 0
"EU 1
no 1
longer 1
considers 1
#Hamas 1
a 1
terrorist 1
group. 1

Time 1
for 1
US 1
to 1
do 1
same." 1

Kuttab 0
has 0
defended 0
Islamic 0
anti-Semitism 0
by 0
claiming 0
that 0
the 0
“distrust 0
Moslems 0
feel 0
towards 0
Jews” 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
“two 0
acts 0
of 0
betrayal 0
by 0
Jewish 0
tribes 0
against 0
the 0
Prophet.” 0
And 0
that 0
Jews 0
suffer 0
from 0
a 0
“Holocaust 1
Syndrome” 1
of 1
entitlement. 1

He 0
justified 0
hijacking 0
planes, 0
described 0
suicide 0
bombers 0
as 0
“taking 0
the 0
supreme 0
sacrifice” 0
and 0
defended 0
Hezbollah 1
as 1
“an 1
armed-resistance 1
movement” 1

He 0
has 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
"Jewish 0
community 0
gradually 0
consolidated 0
its 0
power, 0
wealth, 0
and 0
influence 0
in 0
all 0
sectors 0
of 0
society" 0
especially 0
in 0
"crucial 0
sectors 0
like 0
banking, 0
finance, 0
media” 0
where 0
"their 0
influence 0
both 0
as 0
individuals 0
and 0
an 0
organized 0
community 0
far 0
exceeded 0
their 0
numbers" 0
and 0
that 0
their 0
power 0
strengthens 0
“conspiracy 0
theories 0
about 0
‘Jewish 0
control’ 0
that 0
are 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
the 0
infamous 0
“’Protocols 0
of 0
the 0
Elders 0
of 0
Zion.’” 0

Robert 0
Herbst 0
and 0
Jonathan 0
Kuttab 0
are 0
both 0
supporters 0
of 0
a 0
one-state 0
plan 0
for 0
eliminating 0
Israel. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
is 0
co-sponsoring 0
a 0
JVP 0
anti-Israel 0
event 0
by 0
two 0
opponents 0
of 0
Israel, 0
one 0
of 0
whom 0
has 0
defended 0
Hamas. 0

An 0
organization 0
that 0
hands 0
out 0
the 0
Emma 0
Lazarus 0
Award, 0
named 0
after 0
a 0
passionate 0
Zionist, 0
at 0
its 0
posh 0
dinners 0
is 0
hosting 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
Israel. 0

The 0
“Jewish 0
Homeland” 0
or 0
“Jewish 0
State” 0
argument 0
is 0
a 0
hook 0
for 0
contending 0
that 0
the 0
Balfour 0
Declaration 0
didn’t 0
endorse 0
Israel, 0
but 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
Jewish 0
Bantustan 0
within 0
a 0
Muslim 0
country. 0

That 0
worked 0
so 0
well 0
for 0
the 0
Christians 0
and 0
Jews 0
of 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
co-sponsoring 0
a 0
one-state 0
event 0
by 0
an 0
anti-Israel 0
hate 0
group. 0

But 0
it’s 0
also 0
hosting 0
it 0
at 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History’s 0
headquarters. 0

AJHS 0
is 0
a 0
component 0
of 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History. 0

And 0
the 0
partnership 0
between 0
AJHS 0
and 0
JVP 0
sheds 0
light 0
on 0
the 0
controversy 0
over 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
David 0
N. 0
Myers, 0
an 0
anti-Israel 0
activist, 0
to 0
head 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History. 0

During 0
the 0
Myers 0
controversy, 0
the 0
Center 0
took 0
pains 0
to 0
disassociate 0
Myers 0
and 0
themselves 0
from 0
JVP 0
because 0
a 0
JVP 0
handout 0
had 0
listed 0
him 0
as 0
a 0
“JVP 0
Academic 0
Advisory 0
Board 0
Member.” 0
But 0
in 0
reality 0
the 0
Center, 0
through 0
AJHS, 0
has 0
an 0
ongoing 0
relationship 0
with 0
JVP. 0

The 0
Balfour 0
event 0
was 0
not 0
AJHS’ 0
only 0
partnership 0
with 0
JVP. 0

In 0
December, 0
the 0
AJHS 0
will 0
feature 0
“Rubble 0
Rubble”, 0
a 0
play 0
by 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
trip 0
to 0
Israel. 0

Fishback 0
is 0
a 0
BDS 0
supporter 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
JVP 0
Artists 0
Council. 0

His 0
goal 0
is 0
to 0
“normalize 0
Jewish 0
anti-Zionism”. 0

AJHS 0
and 0
JVP 0
members 0
get 0
discounted 0
admission. 0

The 0
venue 0
is 0
once 0
again 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History. 0

Specifically 0
the 0
Leo 0
and 0
Julia 0
Forchheimer 0
Auditorium 0
at 0
CJH. 0

Leo 0
Forchheimer’s 0
philanthropy 0
had 0
left 0
its 0
mark 0
on 0
Israel. 0

What 0
would 0
he 0
think 0
if 0
he 0
knew 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
purposes 0
that 0
CJH 0
is 0
putting 0
his 0
gift 0
to? 0

A 0
third 0
AJHS-JVP 0
event 0
featured 0
Efrat 0
Yerday, 0
an 1
anti-Israel 1
activist, 0
accusing 0
Israel 0
of 0
racism. 0

Efrat 0
has 0
claimed 0
that, 0
"Zionism 1
does 1
not 1
only 1
dispossess 1
Palestinians, 1
but 1
it 1
also 1
dispossesses 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
sophisticated 1
way, 1
non-white 1
Jews. 1

Being 1
Jewish 1
is 1
highly 1
identified 1
with 1
being 1
white 1
because 1
of 1
Zionism." 1

AJHS 0
will 0
claim 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
only 0
offering 0
different 0
perspectives. 0

But 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Israel, 0
there’s 0
only 0
one 0
perspective. 0

“Balfour” 0
and 0
“Rubble 0
Rubble” 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
AJHS’ 0
“1917: 0
How 0
One 0
Year 0
Changed 0
the 0
World”. 0

The 0
exhibition 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
cover 0
WWI, 0
the 0
Bolshevik 0
Revolution, 0
and 0
the 0
Balfour 0
Declaration. 0

But 0
the 0
only 0
Balfour 0
program 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
questions 0
whether 0
Israel 0
should 0
even 0
exist. 0

The 0
exhibition 0
closes 0
with 0
Fishback’s 0
anti-Israel 0
agenda. 0

And 0
these 0
are 0
the 0
only 0
listed 0
AJHS 0
programs 0
that 0
focus 0
on 0
Israel. 0

JVP 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
only 0
organization 0
that 0
AJHS 0
chooses 0
to 0
partner 0
with 0
on 0
political 0
events. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
uninterested 0
in 0
holding 0
any 0
pro-Israel 0
events. 0

It’s 0
uninterested 0
in 0
partnering 0
with 0
pro-Israel 0
groups. 0

Instead 0
it’s 0
providing 0
a 0
forum 0
for 0
a 0
BDS 0
hate 0
group. 0

And 0
it’s 0
no 0
mystery 0
why. 0

The 0
AJHS 0
Academic 0
Council 0
is 0
packed 0
with 0
anti-Israel 0
activists. 0

Lila 0
Corwin-Berman, 0
the 0
chair 0
of 0
the 0
AJHS 0
Academic 0
Council 0
who 0
also 0
serves 0
on 0
its 0
board 0
of 0
trustees, 0
is 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Open 0
Hillel 0
Academic 0
Council. 0

Open 0
Hillel 0
seeks 0
to 0
"open" 0
the 0
campus 0
group 0
to 0
BDS 0
and 0
other 0
anti-Israel 0
views. 0

Berman 0
has 0
defended 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
hate 0
group 0
IfNotNow, 0
which 0
employs 0
JVP 0
tactics, 0
and 0
condemned 0
efforts 0
to 0
fight 0
BDS. 0

She 0
signed 0
a 0
petition 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
BDS 0
activists 0
being 0
allowed 0
to 0
enter 0
Israel. 0

Other 0
AJHS 0
Academic 0
Council 0
members 0
who 0
signed 0
the 0
pro-BDS 0
activist 0
petition 0
include 0
Ari 0
Kelman, 0
Riv-Ellen 0
Prell, 0
Deborah 0
Dash 0
Moore, 0
Rachel 0
Kranson, 0
Libby 0
Garland 0
and 0
Kirsten 0
Fermaglich. 0

When 0
we 0
look 0
at 0
what 0
is 0
going 0
on 0
in 0
CJH’s 0
components 0
like 0
the 0
AJHS, 0
the 0
elevation 0
of 0
David 0
N. 0
Myers 0
to 0
head 0
CJH 0
is 0
unsurprising. 0

Myers 0
is 0
a 0
symptom 0
of 0
the 0
problem. 0

As 0
is 0
AJHS’s 0
partnership 0
with 0
JVP. 0

A 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
shocking 0
behavior 0
is 0
taking 0
place 0
inside 0
Jewish 0
organizations 0
whose 0
inner 0
workings 0
most 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
Jewish 0
community 0
generally 0
pay 0
very 0
little 0
attention 0
to. 0

Unlike 0
CJH, 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
is 0
an 0
organization 0
that 0
dates 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
19th 0
century. 0

Its 1
perversion 1
by 0
the 0
radical 0
anti-Jewish 0
and 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
to 0
serve 0
anti-Semitic 0
narratives 0
is 0
tragic. 0

And 0
yet 0
it’s 0
inescapable. 0

Even 0
as 0
the 0
Myers 0
scandal 0
continues 0
to 0
simmer, 1
the 0
AJHS 0
partnership 0
with 0
JVP 0
is 0
making 0
the 0
choice 0
painfully 0
clear. 0

The 0
radical 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
satisfied 0
with 0
embedding 0
“moderate” 0
opposing 0
voices 0
into 0
Jewish 0
organizations. 0

Instead 0
it 0
seeks 0
to 0
normalize 0
the 0
furthest 0
extremes 0
of 0
anti-Israel 0
hatred. 0

And 0
it 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
satisfied 0
with 0
anything 0
less. 0

During 0
the 0
Myers 0
controversy, 0
defenders 0
of 0
his 0
appointment, 0
including 0
some 0
figures 0
named 0
here, 0
claimed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
issue 0
of 0
apolitical 0
scholarship. 0

Is 0
co-sponsoring 0
events 0
with 0
a 0
hate 0
group 0
that 0
has 0
sponsored 0
talks 0
by 0
a 0
woman 0
who 0
accused 1
Jews 1
of 1
drinking 1
blood 1
also 0
apolitical 0
scholarship? 0

The 0
anti-Israel 0
leftists 0
at 0
the 0
AJHS 0
are 0
clearly 0
not 0
leaving 0
their 0
politics 0
at 0
home. 0

And 0
support 0
for 0
them 0
and 0
for 0
Myers 0
cannot 0
be 0
distinguished 0
from 0
support 0
for 0
their 0
views. 0

Not 0
when 0
JVP 0
is 0
at 0
AJHS. 0

We 1
all 1
have 1
choices 1
to 1
make. 1

Sometimes 0
the 0
choices 0
are 0
murky. 0

Other 0
times 0
they 0
are 0
simple 0
and 0
easy. 0

When 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
hosts 0
and 0
co-sponsors 0
an 0
event 0
by 0
a 0
BDS 0
hate 0
group 0
attacking 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
Israel 0
and 0
featuring 0
a 0
speaker 0
who 0
had 0
defended 0
terrorism 0
and 0
anti-Semitism, 0
the 0
choice 0
becomes 0
easy. 0

Either 1
you 1
stand 1
with 1
BDS, 1
Hamas, 1
blood 1
libels 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
want 1
to 1
destroy 1
Israel 1
or 1
with 1
Jews. 1

As 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
radicalism 0
of 0
the 0
left 0
grows, 0
such 0
choices 0
will 0
become 0
even 0
more 0
obscenely 0
simple. 0

But 0
they 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
any 0
less 0
difficult. 0

Opposing 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
makes 0
many 0
important 0
enemies 0
and 0
wins 0
few 0
friends. 0

The 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
has 0
built 0
networks 0
that 0
can 0
blacklist, 0
smear 0
and 0
silence 0
almost 0
anyone 0
in 0
an 0
academic 0
field. 0

Speaking 0
out 0
against 0
hate 0
is 0
easiest 0
when 0
it’s 0
weakest. 0

It’s 0
hardest 0
when 0
it’s 0
strongest. 0

When 0
we 0
think 0
about 0
Nazi 0
Germany, 0
we 0
remember 0
those 0
who 0
spoke 0
out. 0

We 0
don’t 0
remember 0
those 0
who 0
were 0
too 0
intimidated 0
and 0
uncertain 0
to 0
rise 0
against 0
anti-Semitism 0
when 0
they 0
saw 0
it 0
and 0
heard 0
it. 0

History 0
tells 0
us 0
why 0
so 0
many 0
people 0
are 0
afraid 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
right 0
thing 0
when 0
it 0
counts. 0

It 0
also 0
tells 0
us 0
how 0
irrelevant 0
history 0
makes 0
them. 0

There 0
are 0
lessons 0
here 0
for 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History 0
and 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society, 0
for 0
those 0
on 0
the 0
inside 0
who 0
see 0
the 0
corruption 0
of 0
their 0
organizations 0
every 0
day 0
and 0
for 0
those 0
on 0
the 0
outside 0
who 0
are 0
worried 0
about 0
speaking 0
up. 0

There 0
are 0
lessons 0
here 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
us. 0

If 0
you 0
can’t 0
speak 0
out 0
against 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society’s 0
partnership 0
with 0
a 0
hate 0
group 0
linked 0
to 0
a 0
literal 0
blood 0
libels 0
and 0
a 0
speaker 0
who 0
defends 0
Hamas, 0
when 0
will 0
your 0
voice 0
be 0
heard? 0
