The 0 270 5

Democrats 0 270 7
echoed 0 270 7
the 0 270 7
IG 0 270 7
report’s 0 270 7
conclusion 0 270 7
that 0 270 7
there 0 270 7
was 0 270 7
no 0 270 7

up 0 270 8

loose 0 270 8

The 0 270 9
IG 0 270 9

with 0 270 9

Horowitz 0 270 10
said 0 270 10
the 0 270 10
president 0 270 10
had 0 270 10
been 0 270 10
one 0 270 10
of 0 270 10
13 0 270 10
who 0 270 10
had 0 270 10
done 0 270 10
so. 0 270 10

Rep. 0 270 11
Steve 0 270 11
King 0 270 11
asked 0 270 11
about 0 270 11
the 0 270 11
volume 0 270 11
of 0 270 11
communications 0 270 11
between 0 270 11
the 0 270 11
president 0 270 11
and 0 270 11
Clinton. 0 270 11

“I’ll 0 270 12
have 0 270 12
to 0 270 12
get 0 270 12
back 0 270 12
to 0 270 12
you 0 270 12
on 0 270 12
that,” 0 270 12
Horowitz 0 270 12
said, 0 270 12
and 0 270 12
the 0 270 12
IG 0 270 12
was 0 270 12
“not 0 270 12
sure” 0 270 12
if 0 270 12
any 0 270 12
of 0 270 12
the 0 270 12
communications 0 270 12
had 0 270 12
involved 0 270 12
classified 0 270 12
or 0 270 12
top 0 270 12
secret 0 270 12
material. 0 270 12

If 0 270 13
the 0 270 13
IG 0 270 13
did 0 270 13
know 0 270 13
the 0 270 13
subject 0 270 13
of 0 270 13
the 0 270 13
president’s 0 270 13
communications 0 270 13
with 0 270 13
Clinton, 0 270 13
he 0 270 13
failed 0 270 13
to 0 270 13
reveal 0 270 13
any 0 270 13
details. 0 270 13

Horowitz 0 270 14
“would 0 270 14
have 0 270 14
to 0 270 14
ask” 0 270 14
if 0 270 14
his 0 270 14
team 0 270 14
interviewed 0 270 14
any 0 270 14
officials 0 270 14
at 0 270 14
the 0 270 14
Obama 0 270 14
White 0 270 14
House 0 270 14
but 0 270 14
said 0 270 14
“not 0 270 14
the 0 270 14
president 0 270 14
himself.” 0 270 14

Rep. 0 270 15
King 0 270 15
asked 0 270 15
Horowitz 0 270 15
about 0 270 15
his 0 270 15
first 0 270 15
encounter 0 270 15
with 0 270 15
the 0 270 15
switch 0 270 15
of 0 270 15
“extremely 1 270 15
careless” 1 270 15
for 0 270 15
‘gross 1 270 15
negligence,” 1 270 15
which 0 270 15
violated 0 270 15
a 0 270 15
criminal 0 270 15
statute. 0 270 15

Horowitz 0 270 16
found 0 270 16
that 0 270 16
Peter 0 270 16
Strzok, 0 270 16
Lisa 0 270 16
Page, 0 270 16
and 0 270 16
James 0 270 16
Comey 0 270 16
were 0 270 16
all 0 270 16
involved. 0 270 16

The 0 270 17
IG 0 270 17
also 0 270 17
said 0 270 17
his 0 270 17
team 0 270 17
focused 0 270 17
on 0 270 17
the 0 270 17
fact 0 270 17
that 0 270 17
the 0 270 17
classified 0 270 17
material 0 270 17
on 0 270 17
Clinton’s 0 270 17
server 0 270 17
was 0 270 17
“not 0 270 17
clearly 0 270 17
marked,” 0 270 17
which 0 270 17
repeated 0 270 17
one 0 270 17
of 0 270 17
Clinton’s 0 270 17
claims 0 270 17
about 0 270 17
her 0 270 17
negligence. 1 270 17

As 0 270 18
for 0 270 18
the 0 270 18
question 0 270 18
of 0 270 18
her 0 270 18
“intent,” 0 270 18
Horowitz 0 270 18
said 0 270 18
it 0 270 18
arose 0 270 18
“months 0 270 18
earlier,” 0 270 18
maybe 0 270 18
in 0 270 18
2015, 0 270 18
though 0 270 18
he 0 270 18
couldn’t 0 270 18
be 0 270 18
sure. 0 270 18

King 0 270 19
said 0 270 19
President 0 270 19
Obama 0 270 19
had 0 270 19
suggested 0 270 19
the 0 270 19
“careless 0 270 19
but 0 270 19
not 0 270 19
intentional” 0 270 19
language 0 270 19
in 0 270 19
a 0 270 19
“60 0 270 19
Minutes” 0 270 19
appearance 0 270 19
in 0 270 19
October 0 270 19
of 0 270 19
2015. 0 270 19

And 0 270 20
King 0 270 20
had 0 270 20
observed 0 270 20
that 0 270 20
in 0 270 20
his 0 270 20
July 0 270 20
5, 0 270 20
2016 0 270 20
statement, 0 270 20
James 0 270 20
Comey 0 270 20
used 0 270 20
“intent” 0 270 20
six 0 270 20
times. 0 270 20

Horowitz 0 270 21
said 0 270 21
Comey 0 270 21
“concealed 0 270 21
from 0 270 21
the 0 270 21
attorney 0 270 21
general 0 270 21
and 0 270 21
the 0 270 21
deputy 0 270 21
attorney 0 270 21
general, 0 270 21
his 0 270 21
intention 0 270 21
to 0 270 21

a 0 270 21
unilateral 0 270 21
announcement 0 270 21
in 0 270 21
July 0 270 21
2016 0 270 21
about 0 270 21
the 0 270 21
reasons 0 270 21
for 0 270 21
his 0 270 21
recommendations 0 270 21
not 0 270 21
to 0 270 21
prosecute 0 270 21
former 0 270 21
Secretary 0 270 21
Clinton.” 0 270 21
The 0 270 21
IG 0 270 21
also 0 270 21
described 0 270 21
his 0 270 21
report 0 270 21
as 0 270 21
a 0 270 21
“thorough, 0 270 21
comprehensive 0 270 21
and 0 270 21
objective 0 270 21
recitation 0 270 21
of 0 270 21
the 0 270 21
facts.” 0 270 21

The 0 270 22
IG 0 270 22
did 0 270 22
confirm 0 270 22
that 0 270 22
Peter 0 270 22
Strzok 0 270 22
and 0 270 22
Lisa 0 270 22

the 0 270 22
Russia 0 270 22
and 0 270 22
the 0 270 22
Mueller 0 270 22

Horowitz 0 270 23
said 0 270 23
Strzok 0 270 23
and 0 270 23
Page 0 270 23
had 0 270 23
exchanged 0 270 23
“tens 0 270 23
of 0 270 23

of 0 270 23
texts.” 0 270 23
Ohio 0 270 23
Rep. 0 270 23
James 0 270 23
Jordan 0 270 23
asked 0 270 23
Horowitz 0 270 23
when 0 270 23
his 0 270 23
team 0 270 23
had 0 270 23
discovered 0 270 23
the 0 270 23
message 0 270 23
about 0 270 23
“we’ll 0 270 23
stop” 0 270 23
Trump. 0 270 23

Horowitz 0 270 24
conceded 0 270 24
that 0 270 24
this 0 270 24
meant 0 270 24
“stop 0 270 24
Trump 0 270 24
from 0 270 24
becoming 0 270 24
president.” 0 270 24
The 0 270 24
IG 0 270 24
said 0 270 24
they 0 270 24
uncovered 0 270 24
that 0 270 24
text 0 270 24
in 0 270 24
May, 0 270 24
and 0 270 24
Jordan 0 270 24
asked 0 270 24
“why 0 270 24
did 0 270 24
we 0 270 24
not 0 270 24
see 0 270 24
it 0 270 24
until 0 270 24
last 0 270 24
Thursday?” 0 270 24

“I 0 270 25
can’t 0 270 25
answer 0 270 25
that,” 0 270 25
Horowitz 0 270 25
said, 0 270 25
adding 0 270 25
that 0 270 25
it 0 270 25
had 0 270 25
been 0 270 25
sent 0 270 25
to 0 270 25
Rod 0 270 25
Rosenstein’s 0 270 25
department 0 270 25
at 0 270 25
the 0 270 25
DOJ. 0 270 25

Jordan 0 270 26
concluded 0 270 26
that 0 270 26
Rosenstein 0 270 26
“made 0 270 26
the 0 270 26
decision 0 270 26
that 0 270 26
we 0 270 26
had 0 270 26
to 0 270 26
wait 0 270 26
a 0 270 26

Several 0 270 27
representatives 0 270 27
were 0 270 27
curious 0 270 27
about 0 270 27
two 0 270 27

agents 0 270 27
and 0 270 27
one 0 270 27
lawyer 0 270 27
the 0 270 27
IG 0 270 27
report 0 270 27
had 0 270 27
not 0 270 27
named. 0 270 27

“The 0 270 28
FBI 0 270 28
raised 0 270 28
a 0 270 28

they 0 270 28
work 0 270 28
on 0 270 28

matters,” 0 270 28
Horowitz 0 270 28
said. 0 270 28

Rep 0 270 29
Mark 0 270 29

if 0 270 29
the 0 270 29
two 0 270 29

the 0 270 29

“They 0 270 30
