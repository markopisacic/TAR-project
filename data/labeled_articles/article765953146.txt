Inspector 0 44 1

Michael 0 44 1
Horowitz 0 44 1
testified 0 44 1
with 0 44 1
FBI 0 44 1

Christopher 0 44 1
Wray 0 44 1
before 0 44 1

In 0 44 2
a 0 44 2
predictable 0 44 2
performance, 0 44 2
the 0 44 2
duo 0 44 2
cited 0 44 2
mistakes 0 44 2
and 0 44 2
raised 0 44 2
concerns 0 44 2
but 0 44 2
solved 0 44 2
none 0 44 2
of 0 44 2
the 0 44 2
lingering 0 44 2
mysteries 0 44 2
the 0 44 2
massive 0 44 2
report 0 44 2

that 0 44 2
found 0 44 2

not 0 44 2
affect 0 44 2
FBI 0 44 2
and 0 44 2

decisions. 0 44 2

On 0 44 3
Tuesday 0 44 3
Horowitz 0 44 3
performed 0 44 3
solo 0 44 3
before 0 44 3
a 0 44 3
joint 0 44 3
session 0 44 3
of 0 44 3

Oversight 0 44 4
chairman 0 44 4
Trey 0 44 4
Gowdy 0 44 4
delivered 0 44 4
the 0 44 4
opening 0 44 4
statement. 0 44 4

The 0 44 5
attorney 0 44 5
general 0 44 5
had 0 44 5
been 0 44 5
accused 0 44 5
of 0 44 5
“softening 0 44 5
or 0 44 5
watering 0 44 5
down 0 44 5
his 0 44 5
report,” 0 44 5
Gowdy 0 44 5
said, 0 44 5
“When 0 44 5
the 0 44 5
reality 0 44 5
is 0 44 5
it 0 44 5
was 0 44 5
Jim 0 44 5
Comey 0 44 5
who 0 44 5
softened 0 44 5
and 0 44 5
watered 0 44 5
down 0 44 5
his 0 44 5
press 0 44 5
release, 0 44 5
announcing 0 44 5
no 0 44 5
charges 0 44 5
against 0 44 5

Clinton. 0 44 5

We 0 44 6
see 0 44 6
Jim 1 44 6
Comey 1 44 6
and 1 44 6
Jim 1 44 6
Comey 1 44 6
alone 1 44 6
deciding 0 44 6
which 0 44 6
DOJ 0 44 6
policies 0 44 6
to 0 44 6
follow 0 44 6
and 0 44 6
which 0 44 6
to 0 44 6
ignore, 0 44 6
to 0 44 6
decide 0 44 6
whether 0 44 6
there 0 44 6
is 0 44 6
sufficient 0 44 6
evidence 0 44 6
to 0 44 6
support 0 44 6
each 0 44 6
and 0 44 6
every 0 44 6
element 0 44 6
of 0 44 6
an 0 44 6
offense 0 44 6
and 0 44 6
we 0 44 6
see 0 44 6
Jim 1 44 6

and 1 44 6
Jim 1 44 6
Comey 1 44 6
alone 1 44 6

In 0 44 7
a 0 44 7
devastating 1 44 7
exchange 0 44 7
with 0 44 7
Horowitz, 0 44 7
Gowdy 0 44 7
said 0 44 7
that 0 44 7
“prejudging 0 44 7

ends, 0 44 7
and 0 44 7
prejudging 0 44 7
the 0 44 7
outcome 0 44 7
of 0 44 7
an 0 44 7
investigation 0 44 7

it 0 44 7
begins” 0 44 7
is 0 44 7
the 0 44 7
“textbook 0 44 7
definition 0 44 7
of 0 44 7
bias.” 0 44 7
Democrats 0 44 7
echoed 0 44 7
the 0 44 7
IG 0 44 7
report’s 0 44 7
conclusion 0 44 7
that 0 44 7
there 0 44 7
was 0 44 7
no 0 44 7
bias. 0 44 7

Republicans 0 44 8
sought 0 44 8
to 0 44 8
tie 0 44 8
up 0 44 8
some 0 44 8
loose 0 44 8
threads. 0 44 8

The 0 44 9
IG 0 44 9
report 0 44 9
confirmed 0 44 9
that 0 44 9
President 0 44 9
Obama 0 44 9
communicated 0 44 9
with 0 44 9
Hillary 0 44 9
Clinton 0 44 9
on 0 44 9
her 0 44 9
unsecured 0 44 9
email 0 44 9
system. 0 44 9

Horowitz 0 44 10
said 0 44 10
the 0 44 10
president 0 44 10
had 0 44 10
been 0 44 10
one 0 44 10
of 0 44 10
13 0 44 10
who 0 44 10
had 0 44 10
done 0 44 10
so. 0 44 10

Rep. 0 44 11
Steve 0 44 11
King 0 44 11
asked 0 44 11
about 0 44 11
the 0 44 11
volume 0 44 11
of 0 44 11
communications 0 44 11
between 0 44 11
the 0 44 11
president 0 44 11
and 0 44 11
Clinton. 0 44 11

“I’ll 0 44 12
have 0 44 12
to 0 44 12
get 0 44 12
back 0 44 12
to 0 44 12
you 0 44 12
on 0 44 12
that,” 0 44 12
Horowitz 0 44 12
said, 0 44 12
and 0 44 12
the 0 44 12
IG 0 44 12
was 0 44 12
“not 0 44 12
sure” 0 44 12
if 0 44 12
any 0 44 12
of 0 44 12
the 0 44 12
communications 0 44 12
had 0 44 12
involved 0 44 12
classified 0 44 12
or 0 44 12
top 0 44 12
secret 0 44 12
material. 0 44 12

If 0 44 13
the 0 44 13
IG 0 44 13
did 0 44 13
know 0 44 13
the 0 44 13
subject 0 44 13
of 0 44 13
the 0 44 13
president’s 0 44 13
communications 0 44 13
with 0 44 13
Clinton, 0 44 13
he 0 44 13
failed 0 44 13
to 0 44 13
reveal 0 44 13
any 0 44 13
details. 0 44 13

Horowitz 0 44 14
“would 0 44 14
have 0 44 14
to 0 44 14
ask” 0 44 14
if 0 44 14
his 0 44 14
team 0 44 14
interviewed 0 44 14
any 0 44 14
officials 0 44 14
at 0 44 14
the 0 44 14
Obama 0 44 14
White 0 44 14
House 0 44 14
but 0 44 14
said 0 44 14
“not 0 44 14
the 0 44 14
president 0 44 14
himself.” 0 44 14

Rep. 0 44 15
King 0 44 15
asked 0 44 15
Horowitz 0 44 15
about 0 44 15
his 0 44 15
first 0 44 15
encounter 0 44 15
with 0 44 15
the 0 44 15
switch 0 44 15
of 0 44 15
“extremely 1 44 15
careless” 1 44 15
for 0 44 15
‘gross 1 44 15
negligence,” 1 44 15
which 0 44 15
violated 0 44 15
a 0 44 15
criminal 0 44 15
statute. 0 44 15

Horowitz 0 44 16
found 0 44 16
that 0 44 16
Peter 0 44 16
Strzok, 0 44 16
Lisa 0 44 16
Page, 0 44 16
and 0 44 16
James 0 44 16
Comey 0 44 16
were 0 44 16
all 0 44 16
involved. 0 44 16

The 0 44 17
IG 0 44 17
also 0 44 17
said 0 44 17
his 0 44 17
team 0 44 17
focused 0 44 17
on 0 44 17
the 0 44 17
fact 0 44 17
that 0 44 17
the 0 44 17
classified 0 44 17
material 0 44 17
on 0 44 17
Clinton’s 0 44 17
server 0 44 17
was 0 44 17
“not 0 44 17
clearly 0 44 17
marked,” 0 44 17
which 0 44 17
repeated 0 44 17
one 0 44 17
of 0 44 17
Clinton’s 0 44 17
claims 0 44 17
about 0 44 17
her 0 44 17
negligence. 1 44 17

As 0 44 18
for 0 44 18
the 0 44 18
question 0 44 18
of 0 44 18
her 0 44 18
“intent,” 0 44 18
Horowitz 0 44 18
said 0 44 18
it 0 44 18
arose 0 44 18
“months 0 44 18
earlier,” 0 44 18
maybe 0 44 18
in 0 44 18
2015, 0 44 18
though 0 44 18
he 0 44 18
couldn’t 0 44 18
be 0 44 18
sure. 0 44 18

King 0 44 19
said 0 44 19
President 0 44 19
Obama 0 44 19
had 0 44 19
suggested 0 44 19
the 0 44 19
“careless 0 44 19
but 0 44 19
not 0 44 19
intentional” 0 44 19
language 0 44 19
in 0 44 19
a 0 44 19
“60 0 44 19
Minutes” 0 44 19
appearance 0 44 19
in 0 44 19
October 0 44 19
of 0 44 19
2015. 0 44 19

And 0 44 20
King 0 44 20
had 0 44 20
observed 0 44 20
that 0 44 20
in 0 44 20
his 0 44 20
July 0 44 20
5, 0 44 20
2016 0 44 20
statement, 0 44 20
James 0 44 20
Comey 0 44 20
used 0 44 20
“intent” 0 44 20
six 0 44 20
times. 0 44 20

Horowitz 0 44 21
said 0 44 21
Comey 0 44 21
“concealed 0 44 21
from 0 44 21
the 0 44 21
attorney 0 44 21
general 0 44 21
and 0 44 21
the 0 44 21
deputy 0 44 21
attorney 0 44 21
general, 0 44 21
his 0 44 21
intention 0 44 21
to 0 44 21
make 0 44 21
a 0 44 21
unilateral 0 44 21
announcement 0 44 21
in 0 44 21
July 0 44 21
2016 0 44 21
about 0 44 21
the 0 44 21
reasons 0 44 21
for 0 44 21
his 0 44 21
recommendations 0 44 21
not 0 44 21
to 0 44 21
prosecute 0 44 21
former 0 44 21
Secretary 0 44 21
Clinton.” 0 44 21
The 0 44 21
IG 0 44 21
also 0 44 21
described 0 44 21
his 0 44 21
report 0 44 21
as 0 44 21
a 0 44 21
“thorough, 0 44 21
comprehensive 0 44 21
and 0 44 21
objective 0 44 21
recitation 0 44 21
of 0 44 21
the 0 44 21
facts.” 0 44 21

The 0 44 22
IG 0 44 22
did 0 44 22
confirm 0 44 22
that 0 44 22
Peter 0 44 22
Strzok 0 44 22
and 0 44 22
Lisa 0 44 22
Page 0 44 22
worked 0 44 22
on 0 44 22
the 0 44 22
Clinton 0 44 22
investigation, 0 44 22
the 0 44 22
Russia 0 44 22
and 0 44 22
the 0 44 22
Mueller 0 44 22
team. 0 44 22

Horowitz 0 44 23
said 0 44 23
Strzok 0 44 23
and 0 44 23
Page 0 44 23
had 0 44 23
exchanged 0 44 23
“tens 0 44 23
of 0 44 23
thousands 0 44 23
of 0 44 23
texts.” 0 44 23
Ohio 0 44 23
Rep. 0 44 23
James 0 44 23
Jordan 0 44 23
asked 0 44 23
Horowitz 0 44 23
when 0 44 23
his 0 44 23
team 0 44 23
had 0 44 23
discovered 0 44 23
the 0 44 23
message 0 44 23
about 0 44 23
“we’ll 0 44 23
stop” 0 44 23
Trump. 0 44 23

Horowitz 0 44 24
conceded 0 44 24
that 0 44 24
this 0 44 24
meant 0 44 24
“stop 0 44 24
Trump 0 44 24
from 0 44 24
becoming 0 44 24
president.” 0 44 24
The 0 44 24
IG 0 44 24
said 0 44 24
they 0 44 24
uncovered 0 44 24
that 0 44 24
text 0 44 24
in 0 44 24
May, 0 44 24
and 0 44 24
Jordan 0 44 24
asked 0 44 24
“why 0 44 24
did 0 44 24
we 0 44 24
not 0 44 24
see 0 44 24
it 0 44 24
until 0 44 24
last 0 44 24
Thursday?” 0 44 24

“I 0 44 25
can’t 0 44 25
answer 0 44 25
that,” 0 44 25
Horowitz 0 44 25
said, 0 44 25
adding 0 44 25
that 0 44 25
it 0 44 25
had 0 44 25
been 0 44 25
sent 0 44 25
to 0 44 25
Rod 0 44 25
Rosenstein’s 0 44 25
department 0 44 25
at 0 44 25
the 0 44 25
DOJ. 0 44 25

Jordan 0 44 26
concluded 0 44 26
that 0 44 26
Rosenstein 0 44 26
“made 0 44 26
the 0 44 26
decision 0 44 26
that 0 44 26
we 0 44 26
had 0 44 26
to 0 44 26
wait 0 44 26
a 0 44 26
month.” 0 44 26

Several 0 44 27
representatives 0 44 27
were 0 44 27
curious 0 44 27
about 0 44 27
two 0 44 27
FBI 0 44 27
agents 0 44 27
and 0 44 27
one 0 44 27
lawyer 0 44 27
the 0 44 27
IG 0 44 27
report 0 44 27
had 0 44 27
not 0 44 27
named. 0 44 27

“The 0 44 28
FBI 0 44 28
raised 0 44 28
a 0 44 28
concern 0 44 28
because 0 44 28
they 0 44 28
work 0 44 28
on 0 44 28
counterintelligence 0 44 28
matters,” 0 44 28
Horowitz 0 44 28
said. 0 44 28

Rep 0 44 29
Mark 0 44 29
Meadows 0 44 29
asked 0 44 29
if 0 44 29
the 0 44 29
two 0 44 29
FBI 0 44 29
agents 0 44 29
were 0 44 29
Kevin 0 44 29
Clinesmith 0 44 29
and 0 44 29
Sally 0 44 29
Moyer, 0 44 29
which 0 44 29
the 0 44 29
IG 0 44 29
declined 0 44 29
to 0 44 29
confirm. 0 44 29

“They 0 44 30
don’t 0 44 30
work 0 44 30
in 0 44 30
counterintelligence,” 0 44 30
said 0 44 30
Meadows, 0 44 30
who 0 44 30
charged 0 44 30
that 0 44 30
the 0 44 30
FBI 0 44 30
gave 0 44 30
the 0 44 30
IG 0 44 30
“false 0 44 30
information” 0 44 30
and 0 44 30
altered 0 44 30
key 0 44 30
witness 0 44 30
reports. 0 44 30

“How 0 44 31
did 0 44 31
Comey 0 44 31
see 0 44 31
the 0 44 31
report 0 44 31
before 0 44 31
it 0 44 31
came 0 44 31
out?” 0 44 31
Rep. 0 44 31
Darrell 0 44 31
Issa 0 44 31
wanted 0 44 31
to 0 44 31
know. 0 44 31

Horowitz 0 44 32
said 0 44 32
Comey 0 44 32
didn’t 0 44 32
see 0 44 32
the 0 44 32
whole 0 44 32
thing, 0 44 32
but 0 44 32
explained 0 44 32
that 0 44 32
he 0 44 32
allowed 0 44 32
those 0 44 32
the 0 44 32
IG 0 44 32
team 0 44 32
had 0 44 32
criticized 0 44 32
to 0 44 32
have 0 44 32
a 0 44 32
look 0 44 32
before 0 44 32
release. 0 44 32

By 0 44 33
the 0 44 33
end 0 44 33
