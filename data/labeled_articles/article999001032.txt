Omar 1
Smith, 1
who 1
says 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
college 1
with 1
Gillum, 1
reveals 1
Gillum 1
cannot 1
fulfill 1
his 1
campaign 1
promises 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
to. 1

When 1

fund 1
all 1

says 1
he 1
wants 1

Smith 0
says: 0

SMITH: 0
“That’s 0
not 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
know… 0
That’s 0
not 0
for 0
them 0
to 0

saying, 0
modern 0
day 0
fairy 0
tales 0
start 0
with 0
‘once 0
I 0

'” 0

Smith 1
explains 1
that 1
most 1
of 1
Gillum’s 1
campaign 1
promises 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
implemented, 1
and 0
that 0
the 0
Gillum 0
campaign 0
knows 0
this: 0

SMITH: 0
“So, 1
let’s 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
Mr. 1
Gillum’s 1
platform, 1
right? 1

Raise 1
the 1
corporate 1
tax 1
in 1
Florida 1
from 1
7 1
to 1
11 1
percent. 1

That 1
will 1
never 1
happen. 1

Raise 1
teacher’s 1
pay 1
to 1
$50,000, 1
that 1
will 1
never 1
happen. 1

Give 1
me 1
another 1
position. 1

Medicare 1
for 1
all, 1
that 1
will 1
never 1
happen. 1

The 0
reason 0
being, 0
the 0
legislature 0
that 0
write 0
the 0
bills 0
is 0
all 0
Republican 0
controlled. 0

Democratic 0
governor, 0
Republican 0
legislature. 0

So, 0
unless 0
the 0
legislature 0
writes 0
a 0
bill, 0
and 0
it 0
got 0
voted 0
on 0
the 0
floor, 0
it 0
cannot 0
pass.” 0

Smith 0
says 0
that 0
“the 0
rules 0
in 0
Florida 0
are 1
f***ed 1
up” 1
and 0
that 0
Florida 0
is 0
a 1
“cracker 1
state,” 1
explaining 0
that 0
the 0
Florida 0
legislature 0
has 0
to 0
become 0
racially 0
black 0
for 0
Gillum’s 0
agenda 0
to 0
advance. 0

“Whip 1
up” 1
the 1
poor 1
into 1
a 1
“frenzy 1
in 1
order 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
vote.” 1

Smith 0
says 0
that 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
voters 0
on 0
board 0
with 0
Gillum’s 1
fairy 1
tale 1
platform, 1
the 0
campaign 0
must 0
“whip” 1
lower 1
income 1
individuals 1
“into 1
a 1
frenzy.” 1

SMITH: 0
“You 1
whip 1
’em 1
up. 1

The 1
poor, 1
the 1
middle 1
income. 1

You 1
have 1
to 1
whip 1
them 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
frenzy 1
in 1
order 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
vote. 1

Once 0
Gillum 0
is 0
in, 0
in 0
another 0
2 0
years, 0
other 0
Republican 0
Senators 0
and 0
Legislators 0
will 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
ballot. 0

So, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
whip 1
up 1
the 0
Andrew 0
Gillum 0
voters 0
again 0
in 0
those 0
counties 0
to 0
vote 0
out 0
the 0
Republican 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
Democratic 0
Legislature 0
in 0
order 0
for 0
his 0
(Gillum) 0
will 0
to 0
be 0
executed.” 0

Smith 0
adds 0
that 0
because 0
not 0
all 0
Democratic 0
voters 0
are 0
the 0
same, 0
that 0
the 0
Gillum 0
campaign 0
needs 1
to 1
appeal 1
to 1
“white 1
guilt” 1
to 0
turn 0
out 0
the 0
vote: 0

SMITH: 0
“You 1
have 1
to 1
appeal 1
to 1
white 1
guilt… 1
[be]cause 1
that’s 1
what 1
it 1
is.” 1

Smith 0
also 0
explains 0
that 0
the 0
Gillum 0
campaign 0
can’t 0
let 0
voters 0
know 0
what 0
Gillum’s 0
true 0
agenda 0
is 0
before 0
election 0
day: 0

SMITH: 0
“… 0
We 1
don’t, 1
do 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
[the 1
voters] 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
agenda 1
is 1
ahead 1
of 1
time? 1

We 1
can’t… 1
We 1
cannot… 1
You 1
alienate 1
everybody. 1

Then 0
you 0
get 0
painted 0
like, 0
oh, 0
Gillum 0
is 0
being 0
painted, 0
no. 0

You 0
are 0
a 0
socialist, 0
you 1
are 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
left 1
field…” 1

Gillum 0
is 0
a 1
“crazy, 1
crazy,” 1
Democrat 1

Smith 0
also 0
explains 0
Gillum’s 0
political 0
worldview, 0
saying 0
that 0
“Gillum 0
is 0
a 1

He 0
is 0

Cliff 0

adds 0
that 0
during 0
the 0

primary, 0
Gillum 1
had 1
to 1
campaign 1
on 1
values 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
really 1
believe: 1

ESERMAN: 0
“In 0
order 0
to 0
win 0
he 0
had 0
to 0
be… 0
He’s 0
really 0
left 1
of 1

So 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
left, 1
not 1
left 1
of 1

For 0
the 0
primary. 0

Now 0
[in 0

he’s 0
