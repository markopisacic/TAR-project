“We 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
nexus 0
of 0
terrorism 0
at 0
this 0
point,” 0
Ragan 0
said. 0

That 0
means 0
they 0
didn’t 0
find 0
an 0
ISIS 0
membership 0
card 0
in 0
his 0
wallet, 0
or 0
lots 0
of 0
phone 0
calls 0
to 0
Iraq 0
or 0
Syria, 0
or 0
a 0
note 0
from 0
Kazi 0
reading, 0
“I 0
did 0
this 0
for 0
Allah 0
and 0
Islam. 0

Allahu 1
akbar.” 1

Of 1
course, 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
those 1
things, 1
given 1
their 1
track 1
record 1
of 1
denial 1
and 1
deception, 1
they 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
searching 1
for 1
Kazi’s 1
motive. 1

In 1
any 1
case, 1
a 1
larger 1
point 1
is 1
being 1
lost 1
here. 1

And 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
war 1
going 1
on. 1

We 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
Islamic 1
State, 1
al-Qaeda 1
and 1
other 1
groups 1
have 1
called 1
upon 1
Muslims 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
kill 1
military 1
personnel 1
and 1
police, 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
civilians. 1

We 0
know 0
that 0
Kazi, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
propane 0
and 0
gas 0
tanks 0
in 0
his 0
car, 0
was 0
clearly 0
trying 0
to 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
major 0
fire 0
that 0
would 0
kill 0
more 0
people 0
than 0
just 0
himself. 0

Even 0
if 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
to 0
Baghdadi, 0
the 0
likelihood 0
is 0
that 0
when 0
a 0
Muslim 0
drives 0
into 0
a 0
U.S. 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base 0
with 0
a 0
car 0
full 0
of 0
incendiaries, 0
probably 0
this 0
has 0
something 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
global 0
jihad. 0

The 0
FBI’s 0
bafflement 0
here 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
deep, 0
deep 0
corruption. 0

The 0
FBI 0
doesn’t 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
global 0
jihad, 0
or 0
that 0
Islam 0
has 0
anything 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
terrorism. 0

It 0
doesn’t 0
admit 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
war 0
going 0
on, 0
and 0
treats 0
each 0
act 0
of 0
Islamic 0
terror 0
as 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
a 0
separate 0
and 0
discrete 0
criminal 0
event, 0
unrelated 0
to 0
all 0
the 0
others. 0

So, 0
each 0
time 0
something 0
like 0
this 0
happens, 0
they’re 0
back 0
at 0
Square 0
One, 0
trying 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
motive. 0

It’s 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Army 0
stopped 0
to 0
interrogate 0
every 0
German 0
soldier 0
who 0
crashed 0
through 0
the 0
Ardennes 0
Forest 0
at 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Battle 0
of 0
the 0
Bulge 0
in 0
1944, 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
each 0
one’s 0
actions 0
had 0
anything 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
German 1
Army 1
and 1
Adolf 1
Hitler’s 1
war 0
aims. 0

This 0
willful 0
ignorance 0
leads 0
to 0
a 0
diversion 0
and 0
waste 0
of 0
resources 0
that 0
is 0
astronomical 1
and 1
catastrophic. 1
