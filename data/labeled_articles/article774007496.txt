Jews. 1
" 0

It 0
can't 0
be 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
Muslim 0
Judeophobia. 0

(That 0
would 0
be 0
Islamophobic.) 0

And 0
since 0
we're 0
in 0
Europe, 0
it's 0
time 0
to 0
default 0
to 0
the 0
standard 0
excuse, 0
mental 0
illness, 0

flavor, 0
over-excitement. 0

The 0
police 0
quickly 0
intervened 0
to 0
save 0
the 0
victim 0
who 0
lodged 0
a 0
complaint. 0

The 0
anti-Semitic 0
attacker 0
was 0
arrested 0

placed 0
in 0

then 0
transferred 0
to 0
the 0
psychiatric 0
infirmary, 0
on 0
the 0
recommendation 0
of 0
the 0
doctor 0
because 0
of 0
his 0

state 0
of 0
excitement. 0

It's 0
okay. 0

Getting 0
really 1
excited 1
about 0
Jews 0
is 0
a 0
common 0
problem 0
among 0
Muslim 0
settlers 0
in 0
France. 0

Earlier 0
this 0
month, 0
the 0
suspect 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
murder 0
of 0
a 0
Jewish 0
physician 0
in 0
Paris 0
was 0
deemed 0
not 0
responsible 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
in 0
a 0
second 0
psychiatric 0
evaluation 0
ordered 0
by 0
a 0
judge 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
defense 0
did 0
not 0
request 0
it. 0

The 0
suspect, 0
Traore 0
Kobili, 0
is 0
scheduled 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
third 0
evaluation 0
to 0
determine 0
his 0
ability 0
to 0
stand 0
trial 0
for 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
Sarah 0
Halimi 0
in 0
April 0
2017. 0

He 0
is 0
alleged 0
to 0
have 0
beaten 1
her 1
to 1
death 1
while 0
calling 0
her 0
a 0
demon 1
and 0
shouting 0
about 0
Allah 0
before 0
throwing 0
her 0
body 0
from 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
her 0
third-story 0
apartment. 0

They're 1
all 1
crazy 1
in 1
Europe. 1

A 0
Muslim 0
terrorist 0
stabbed 0
four 0
people 0
at 0
a 0
train 0
station 0
near 0
Munich 0
while 0
screaming, 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar”. 1

In 0
between 0
proclaiming 0
the 0
glory 0
of 0
Allah, 0
he 0
also 0
shouted 0
that 0
his 0
victims 0
were 0
all 0
“unbelievers”. 1

A 0
woman 0
heard 0
him 0
say, 0
“Infidel, 1
you 1
must 1
die”. 1

The 0
German 0
authorities 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
inescapable 0
conclusion 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Islam. 0

Instead 0
the 0
Muslim 0
terrorist 0
had 0
been 0
“mentally 1
ill” 1
and 0
was 0
probably 0
not 0
even 0
fit 0
to 0
stand 0
trial. 0

And 0
in 0
Russia. 0

Gyulchekhra 0
Bobokulova 0
beheaded 1
a 0
4-year-old 0
girl 0
and 0
displayed 0
her 0
head 0
in 0
the 0
street 0
while 0
shouting, 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar. 1

I 0
hate 0
democracy. 0

I 0
am 0
a 0
terrorist. 0

I 0
want 0
you 0
dead.” 0
Faced 0
with 0
these 0
bafflingly 0
inscrutable 0
statements, 0
the 0
authorities 0
blamed 0
mental 1
illness. 1

And 0
Amsterdam. 0

In 0
May, 0
Malek, 0
a 0
Syrian 0
refugee, 0
stabbed 0
three 0
people 0
in 0
The 0
Hague 0
while 0
shouting, 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar.” 1
The 0
Syrian 0
had 0
previously 0
thanked 0
the 0
Dutch 0
people 0
for 0
their 0
hospitality 0
by 0
shouting, 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar,” 1
and 0
throwing 0
pieces 0
of 0
furniture 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
his 0
apartment 0
and 0
into 0
the 0
street. 0

On 0
the 0
loose, 0
Malek 0
cut 0
a 0
man’s 0
throat. 0

He 0
also 0
stabbed 0
two 0
others. 0

Police 0
shot 0
him 0
in 0
the 0
leg, 0
ruled 0
out 0
terrorism 0
and 0
blamed 0
mental 1
illness. 1

In 0
December 0
of 0
last 0
year, 0
Saleh 0
Ali, 0
a 0
Syrian 0
refugee 0
wearing 0
a 0
keffiyah 0
and 0
waving 0
a 0
terrorist 0
PLO 0
flag, 0
went 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
Jewish 0
restaurant 0
in 0
Amsterdam, 0
shouted 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar” 1
and 0
began 0
smashing 0
the 0
windows. 0

The 0
police 0
stood 0
by 0
and 0
watched 0
until 0
he 0
was 0
done. 0

And 0
then 0
they 0
arrested 0
him. 0

Ali 0
admitted 0
to 0
having 0
fought 0
with 0
Jihadists 0
in 0
Syria. 0

So 0
the 0
system 0
decided 0
that 0
he 0
needed 0
a 0
psychiatric 0
evaluation 0

Maybe 0
it's 0
not 0
the 0
terrorists 0
who 0
are 0
nuts. 1

Maybe 1
it's 1
the 1
authorities 1
who 1
are 1
insane. 1
