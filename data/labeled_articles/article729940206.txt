Sociology 1 358 3
helped 1 358 3

too 0 358 4

all 0 358 4

Ashley 0 358 6
Arnold, 0 358 6
a 0 358 6
27-year-old 0 358 6
working 0 358 6
on 0 358 6
an 0 358 6

As 0 358 7
part 0 358 7
of 0 358 7
her 0 358 7
final 0 358 7
class, 0 358 7
for 0 358 7
which 0 358 7
she 0 358 7
paid 0 358 7
almost 0 358 7
$1,000, 0 358 7
students 0 358 7
were 0 358 7
required 0 358 7
to 0 358 7
complete 0 358 7
a 0 358 7
project 0 358 7
outline 0 358 7
last 0 358 7
month 0 358 7
in 0 358 7
which 0 358 7
they 0 358 7
would 0 358 7
compare 0 358 7
a 0 358 7
social 0 358 7
norm 0 358 7
in 0 358 7
the 0 358 7
US 0 358 7
and 0 358 7
another 0 358 7
country. 0 358 7

For 0 358 8
her 0 358 8
"norm" 0 358 8
Arnold 0 358 8
picked 0 358 8
social 0 358 8
media 0 358 8
use, 0 358 8
and 0 358 8
for 0 358 8
her 0 358 8
country 0 358 8
she 0 358 8
chose 0 358 8
Australia. 0 358 8

But 0 358 9
when 0 358 9
Arnold 0 358 9
got 0 358 9
her 0 358 9
grade 0 358 9
back 0 358 9
on 0 358 9
Feb. 0 358 9
1, 0 358 9
she 0 358 9
was 0 358 9
shocked 1 358 9
to 0 358 9
see 0 358 9
her 0 358 9
professor 0 358 9
had 0 358 9
failed 0 358 9
her. 0 358 9

Why? 0 358 10

Because, 0 358 11
according 0 358 11
to 0 358 11
the 0 358 11
teacher, 0 358 11
"Australia 0 358 11
is 0 358 11
a 0 358 11
continent; 0 358 11
not 0 358 11
a 0 358 11
country." 0 358 11

Sociology. 1 358 12

You 1 358 13
really 1 358 13
don't 1 358 13
need 1 358 13
to 1 358 13
know 1 358 13
anything. 1 358 13

The 1 358 14
professor, 1 358 14
who 1 358 14
has 1 358 14
a 1 358 14
PhD 1 358 14
in 1 358 14
philosophy... 1 358 14

Of 1 358 15
course 1 358 15
she 1 358 15
does. 1 358 15

I 0 358 16
believe 0 358 16
I 0 358 16
got 0 358 16
zero 0 358 16
or 0 358 16
partial 0 358 16
credit 0 358 16
because 0 358 16
the 0 358 16
instructor 0 358 16
said, 0 358 16
'Australia 0 358 16
is 0 358 16
a 0 358 16
continent; 0 358 16
not 0 358 16
a 0 358 16
country. 0 358 16

However, 0 358 17
I 0 358 17
believe 0 358 17
that 0 358 17
Australia 0 358 17
is 0 358 17
a 0 358 17
country. 0 358 17

The 0 358 18
research 0 358 18
starter 0 358 18
on 0 358 18
the 0 358 18
SNHUâ€™s 0 358 18
Shapiro 0 358 18
library 0 358 18
written 0 358 18
by 0 358 18
John 0 358 18
Pearson 0 358 18
(2013) 0 358 18
states, 0 358 18
that 0 358 18
Australia 0 358 18
is 0 358 18
the 0 358 18
'sixth-largest 0 358 18
country 0 358 18
in 0 358 18
the 0 358 18
world' 0 358 18
(n.p.). 0 358 18

The 0 358 19
full 0 358 19
name 0 358 19
of 0 358 19
the 0 358 19
country 0 358 19
is 0 358 19
the 0 358 19
Commonwealth 0 358 19
of 0 358 19
Australia, 0 358 19
meaning 0 358 19
Australia 0 358 19
is 0 358 19
both 0 358 19
a 0 358 19
continent 0 358 19
and 0 358 19
a 0 358 19
country. 0 358 19

Therefore, 0 358 20
these 0 358 20
sections 0 358 20
of 0 358 20
the 0 358 20
rubric 0 358 20
should 0 358 20
be 0 358 20
amended. 0 358 20

Australia's 0 358 21
nationhood 0 358 21
is 0 358 21
not 0 358 21
a 0 358 21
matter 0 358 21
of 0 358 21
belief. 0 358 21

But 0 358 22
we 0 358 22
are 0 358 22
in 0 358 22
the 1 358 22
age 1 358 22
of, 1 358 22
"My 1 358 22
truth". 1 358 22

And 0 358 23
my 1 358 23
truth 1 358 23
has 0 358 23
a 0 358 23
different 0 358 23
belief 0 358 23
about 0 358 23
Australia 0 358 23
than 0 358 23
yours 0 358 23
does 0 358 23
because 0 358 23
of 0 358 23
my 0 358 23
degree 0 358 23
of 0 358 23
oppression. 0 358 23

Finally, 0 358 24

the 0 358 25
professor 0 358 25
responded: 0 358 25
Thank 0 358 25
you 0 358 25
for 0 358 25
this 0 358 25
web-address 0 358 25

After 0 358 26
I 0 358 26
do 0 358 26
some 0 358 26
independent 0 358 26
research 0 358 26
on 0 358 26
the 0 358 26
continent/country 0 358 26
issue 0 358 26
I 0 358 26
will 0 358 26
review 0 358 26
your 0 358 26
paper. 0 358 26

Who 0 358 27
can 0 358 27
really 0 358 27
say? 0 358 27
