Sociology 1
helped 1
generate 1
a 1
whole 1
range 1
of 1
fake 1
new 1
academic 1
subjects 1

corrupting 1
existing 1
ones 1

a 1

stew 1
of 1
racism 1
and 1
meaningless 1
jargon. 1

All 0
too 0
often, 0
all 0
you 0

is 0
some 0

concerns 0
Ashley 0
Arnold, 0
a 0
27-year-old 0
working 0
on 0
an 0
online 0
sociology 0
degree. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
her 0
final 0
class, 0
for 0
which 0
she 0
paid 0
almost 0
$1,000, 0
students 0
were 0
required 0
to 0
complete 0
a 0
project 0
outline 0
last 0
month 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
would 0
compare 0
a 0
social 0
norm 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
another 0
country. 0

For 0
her 0
"norm" 0
Arnold 0
picked 0
social 0
media 0
use, 0
and 0
for 0
her 0
country 0
she 0
chose 0
Australia. 0

But 0
when 0
Arnold 0
got 0
her 0
grade 0
back 0
on 0
Feb. 0
1, 0
she 0
was 0
shocked 1
to 0
see 0
her 0
professor 0
had 0
failed 0
her. 0

Why? 0

Because, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
teacher, 0
"Australia 0
is 0
a 0
continent; 0
not 0
a 0
country." 0

You 1
really 1
don't 1
need 1
to 1
know 1
anything. 1

The 1
professor, 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
PhD 1
in 1
philosophy... 1

Of 1
course 1
she 1
does. 1

I 0
believe 0
I 0
got 0
zero 0
or 0
partial 0
credit 0
because 0
the 0
instructor 0
said, 0
'Australia 0
is 0
a 0
continent; 0
not 0
a 0
country. 0

However, 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
a 0
country. 0

The 0
research 0
starter 0
on 0
the 0
SNHUâ€™s 0
Shapiro 0
library 0
written 0
by 0
John 0
Pearson 0
(2013) 0
states, 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
the 0
'sixth-largest 0
country 0
in 0
the 0
world' 0
(n.p.). 0

The 0
full 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
country 0
is 0
the 0
Commonwealth 0
of 0
Australia, 0
meaning 0
Australia 0
is 0
both 0
a 0
continent 0
and 0
a 0
country. 0

Therefore, 0
these 0
sections 0
of 0
the 0
rubric 0
should 0
be 0
amended. 0

Australia's 0
nationhood 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
belief. 0

But 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
the 1
age 1
of, 1
"My 1
truth". 1

And 0
my 1
truth 1
has 0
a 0
different 0
belief 0
about 0
Australia 0
than 0
yours 0
does 0
because 0
of 0
my 0
degree 0
of 0
oppression. 0

Finally, 0

the 0
professor 0
responded: 0
Thank 0
you 0
for 0
this 0
web-address 0

After 0

I 0
do 0
some 0
independent 0
research 0
on 0
the 0
continent/country 0
issue 0
I 0
will 0
review 0
your 0
paper. 0
