Raising 0
a 0
Common 0
Voice 0

In 0
conversation 0
with 0
LifeSiteNews, 0
Schneider 0
said 0
greater 0
public 0
support 0
of 0
the 0
document 0
from 0
the 0
world’s 0
5,000 0
bishops 0
would 0
be 0
“a 0
stronger 0
voice 0
for 0
professing 0
the 0
constant 0
truths 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
beautiful 1
common 1
voice 1
defending 1
the 1
sanctity 1
and 1
the 1
indissolubility 1
of 1
marriage 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
real 1
neo-pagan 1
society 1
where 1
divorce 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
plague 1
and 1
where 1
sexual 1
depravity 1
is 1
increasingly 1
spreading.” 1

The 0
Profession 0
of 0
Immutable 0
Truths 0
about 0
Sacramental 0
Marriage 0
was 0
issued 0
by 0
three 0
Kazakh 0
Ordinaries, 0
including 0
Bishop 0
Schneider, 0
in 0
early 0
January. 0

In 0
the 0
document, 0
the 0
three 0
bishops 0
solemnly 0
professed 0
the 0
Church’s 0
received 0
teaching 0
and 0
discipline 0
regarding 0
sacramental 0
marriage 0
and 0
the 0
limited 0
conditions 0
(see 0
Familiaris 0
Consortio, 0
n. 0
84) 0
under 0
which 0
Catholics 0
who 0
are 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
may 0
receive 0
sacramental 0
absolution 0
and 0
Holy 0
Communion. 0

They 0
presented 0
their 0
profession 0
“before 0
God 0
who 0
will 0
judge 0
us,” 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
certain 0
pastoral 0
norms 0
issued 0
by 0
several 0
bishops’ 0
conferences 0
aimed 0
at 0
implementing 0
chapter 0
8 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
apostolic 0
exhortation 0
on 0
the 0
family, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

Some 1
of 1
these 1
norms, 1
Schneider 1
told 1
LifeSiteNews, 1
give 1
“implicit 1
approval” 1
of 1
divorce 1
and 1
of 1
sexual 1
activity 1
outside 1
a 1
valid 1
marriage. 1

Such 1
a 1
reading 1
is 1
causing 1
“rampant 1
confusion,” 1
will 1
spread 1
“a 1
plague 1
of 1
divorce” 1
in 1
the 1
Church, 1
and 1
is 1
“alien” 1
to 1
the 1
Church’s 1
entire 1
faith 1
and 1
Tradition, 1
the 0
three 0
bishops 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
profession. 0

“This 0
is 0
contrary 0
to 0
Divine 0
Revelation,” 0
Schneider 0
further 0
told 0
LifeSite, 0
adding 0
that 0
the 1
“beautiful 1
explanations” 1
that 1
are 1
being 1
presented 1
to 1
clergy 1
and 1
faithful 1
as 1
“discernment” 1
and 1
“pastoral 1
accompaniment,” 1
or 1
a 1
“change 1
of 1
paradigm” 1
and 1
“discovery 1
of 1
the 1
subjective 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
truth,” 1
when 1
translated 1
into 1
“common 1
sense 1
language,” 1
are 1
tantamount 1
to 1
an 1
allowance 1
to 1
sin. 1

“Our 0
conscience 0
as 0
bishops 0
calls 0
to 0
us 0
to 0
do 0
this,” 0
Schneider 0
explained. 0

“We 0
were 0
forced 0
by 0
our 0
conscience, 0
in 0
the 0
conscience 0
of 0
the 0
Successors 0
of 0
the 0
Apostles 0
and 0
colleagues 0
of 0
the 0
Pope.” 0

As 1
Successors 1
of 1
the 1
Apostles, 1
Schneider 1
said 1
they 1
“could 1
not 1
act 1
in 1
another 1
way.” 1
