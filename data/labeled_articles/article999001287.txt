Bradley 1
McVay, 1
DOS 1
interim 1
general 1
counsel, 1
asked 1
attorneys 1
in 1
Florida 1
to 1
investigate 1
the 1
conflicting 1
dates. 1

“Altering 1
a 1
form 1
in 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
provides 1
the 1
incorrect 1
date 1
for 1
a 1
voter 1
to 1
cure 1
a 1
defect 1
… 1
imposes 1
a 1
burden 1
on 1
the 1
voter 1
significant 1
enough 1
to 1
frustrate 1
the 1
voter’s 1
ability 1
to 1
vote,” 1
McVay 1
wrote 1
in 1
a 1
letter, 1
sent 1
on 1
Nov. 1
9 1
and 1
publicly 1
released 1
on 1
Tuesday. 1

According 0
to 0
DOS 0
officials, 0
they 0
are 0
less 0
concerned 0
with 0
the 0
inaccurate 0
dates, 0
and 0
more 0
concerned 0
with 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
cure 0
affidavits 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
deliberately 0
altered. 0

State 0
officials 0
turned 0
over 0
the 0
altered 0
forms 0
to 0
federal 0
investigators. 0

Of 0
the 0
many 0
allegations 0
of 0
ballot 0
mishandling 0
in 0
Florida, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
federal 0
government. 0

While 0
Democrats 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
told 0
voters 0
they 0
could 0
fix 0
ballot 0
errors 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
Thursday 0
after 0
Election 0
Day 0
— 0
these 0
votes 0
could 0
not 0
count. 0

It 1
looks 1
like 1
Democrats 1
may 1
have 1
hurt 1
their 1
own 1
interests 1
by 1
misleading 1
their 1
voters. 1

They 1
may 1
have 1
believed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
supplying 1
the 1
correct 1
information, 1
but 1
they 1
still 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
altered 1
official 1
documents 1
without 1
verifying 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
right, 1
which 1
they 1
weren’t. 1

It 0
is 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
determined 0
whether 0
the 0
federal 0
investigation 0
will 0
find 0
Democratic 1
ineptitude 1
or 1
deception 1
in 0
this 0
case. 0
