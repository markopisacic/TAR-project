Pope 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
Cover-up, 0
Calls 0
on 0
Francis 0
to 0
Resign 0

In 0
this 0
tragic 1
moment 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
various 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world 0
— 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Chile, 0
Honduras, 0
Australia, 0
etc. 0

— 0
bishops 0
have 0
a 0
very 1
grave 1
responsibility. 0

I 0
am 0
thinking 0
in 0
particular 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America, 0
where 0
I 0
was 0
sent 0
as 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
on 0
October 0
19, 0
2011, 0
the 0
memorial 0
feast 0
of 0
the 0
First 0
North 0
American 0
Martyrs. 0

The 0
Bishops 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
are 0
called, 0
and 0
I 0
with 0
them, 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
example 0
of 0
these 0
first 0
martyrs 0
who 0
brought 0
the 0
Gospel 0
to 0
the 0
lands 0
of 0
America, 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
witnesses 0
of 0
the 0
immeasurable 0
love 0
of 0
Christ, 0
the 0
Way, 0
the 0
Truth 0
and 0
the 0
Life. 0

Also, 0
as 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
unprecedented 0
moment 0
in 0
papal 0
history, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
unprecedented 0
step 0
of 0
recalling 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
to 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
St. 0
Peter 0
should 0
also 0
be 0
considered 0
sooner 0
rather 0
than 0
later, 0
before 1
this 1
crisis 1
gets 1
any 1
more 1
out-of-control 1
than 1
it 1
already 1
is. 1

May 0
God 0
save 0
His 0
Church 0
MJM 0

So 0
serious 0
is 0
the 0
cover-up 0
that 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
protection 0
of 0
the 0
faithful, 0
Archbishop 0
Vigano 0
has 0
called 0
on 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
resign. 0

But 0
before 0
Francis 0
resigns, 0
we 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
demand 0
that 0
he 0
also 0
remove 0
from 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals 0
those 0
who 0
conspired 0
even 0
before 0
the 0
2013 0
conclave 0
to 0
make 0
Jorge 0
Mario 0
Bergoglio 0
pope 0
come 0
hell 0
or 0
high 0
water. 0

He 0
and 0
the 0
St. 0
Gallen 0
Group 0
know 0
exactly 0
who 0
they 0
are. 0

Archbishop 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Viganò's 0
11-page 0
statement, 0
released 0
to 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register, 0
accuses 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
of 0
covering 0
for 0
McCarrick, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
sanctions 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
imposed 0
on 0
McCarrick, 0
and 0
also 0
of 0
making 0
McCarrick 0
a 0
trusted 0
counselor 0
who 0
became 0
Francis's 0
"kingmaker" 0
when 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
American 0
appointments 0
and 0
was 0
highly 0
instrumental 0
in 0
the 0
Pope's 0
decision 0
to 0
elevate 0
far-Left 0
bishops 0
such 0
as 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
of 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Joseph 0
Tobin 0
of 0
Newark 0
to 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals. 0

Remnant 0
Editor's 0
Note: 0
This 0
could 0
well 0
mark 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
disastrous 1
pontificate 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

The 0
former 0
apostolic 0
nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
accused 0
Francis 0
of 0
repealing 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
on 0
then-Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
for 0
sexual 0
abuse. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
charge 0
most 1
serious, 1
perhaps 0
without 0
precedent 0
in 0
modern 0
times. 0

Bishops 0
and 0
priests, 0
abusing 0
their 0
authority, 0
have 0
committed 0
horrendous 1
crimes 0
to 0
the 0
detriment 0
of 0
their 0
faithful, 0
minors, 0
innocent 0
victims, 0
and 0
young 0
men 0
eager 0
to 0
offer 0
their 0
lives 0
to 0
the 0
Church, 0
or 0
by 0
their 0
silence 0
have 0
not 0
prevented 0
that 0
such 0
crimes 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
perpetrated. 0

To 0
restore 0
the 0
beauty 0
of 0
holiness 0
to 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
Bride 0
of 0
Christ, 0
which 0
is 0
terribly 1
disfigured 1
by 0
so 0
many 0
abominable 1
crimes, 1
and 0
if 0
we 0
truly 0
want 0
to 0
free 0
the 0
Church 0
from 0
the 0
fetid 0
swamp 0
into 0
which 0
she 0
has 0
fallen, 0
we 0
must 0
have 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
tear 0
down 0
the 0
culture 0
of 0
secrecy 0
and 0
publicly 0
confess 0
the 0
truths 0
we 0
have 0
kept 0
hidden. 0

We 1
must 1
tear 0
down 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
with 0
which 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
have 0
protected 0
themselves 0
at 0
the 0
expense 0
of 0
their 0
faithful, 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
the 0
world 0
risks 0
making 0
the 0
Church 0
look 0
like 0
a 0
sect, 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
not 0
so 0
dissimilar 0
from 0
the 0
one 0
that 0
prevails 0
in 0
the 0
mafia. 0

“Whatever 0
you 0
have 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
dark 0
... 0
shall 0
be 0
proclaimed 0
from 0
the 0
housetops” 0
(Lk. 0

12:3). 0

I 0
had 0
always 0
believed 0
and 0
hoped 0
that 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
could 0
find 0
within 0
itself 0
the 0
spiritual 0
resources 0
and 0
strength 0
to 0
tell 0
the 0
whole 0
truth, 0
to 0
amend 0
and 0
to 0
renew 0
itself. 0

That 0
is 0
why, 0
even 0
though 0
I 0
had 0
repeatedly 0
been 0
asked 0
to 0
do 0
so, 0
I 0
always 0
avoided 0
making 0
statements 0
to 0
the 0
media, 0
even 0
when 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
my 0
right 0
to 0
do 0
so, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
defend 0
myself 0
against 0
the 0
calumnies 0
published 0
about 0
me, 0
even 0
by 0
high-ranking 0
prelates 0
of 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia. 0

But 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
corruption 0
has 0
reached 0
the 0
very 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
hierarchy, 0
my 0
conscience 0
dictates 0
that 0
I 0
reveal 0
those 0
truths 0
regarding 0
the 0
heart-breaking 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
Emeritus 0
of 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
which 0
I 0
came 0
to 0
know 0
in 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
duties 0
entrusted 0
to 0
me 0
by 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
as 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations, 0
from 0
1998 0
to 0
2009, 0
and 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
as 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America, 0
from 0
October 0
19, 0
2011 0
until 0
end 0
of 0
May 0
2016. 0

As 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations 0
in 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State, 0
my 0
responsibilities 0
were 0
not 0
limited 0
to 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Nunciatures, 0
but 0
also 0
included 0
the 0
staff 0
of 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia 0
(hires, 0
promotions, 0
informational 0
processes 0
on 0
candidates 0
to 0
the 0
episcopate, 0
etc.) 0

and 0
the 0
examination 0
of 0
delicate 0
cases, 0
including 0
those 0
regarding 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops, 0
that 0
were 0
entrusted 0
to 0
the 0
Delegate 0
by 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
or 0
by 0
the 0
Substitute 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State. 0

To 0
dispel 0
suspicions 0
insinuated 0
in 0
several 0
recent 0
articles, 0
I 0
will 0
immediately 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncios 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Gabriel 0
Montalvo 0
and 0
Pietro 0
Sambi, 0
both 0
prematurely 0
deceased, 0
did 0
not 0
fail 0
to 0
inform 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
immediately, 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
they 0
learned 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick’s 0
gravely 1
immoral 1
behavior 1
with 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests. 0

Indeed, 0
according 0
to 0
what 0
Nuncio 0
Pietro 0
Sambi 0
wrote, 0
Father 0
Boniface 0
Ramsey, 0
O.P.’s 0
letter, 0
dated 0
November 0
22, 0
2000, 0
was 0
written 0
at 0
the 0
request 0
of 0
the 0
late 0
Nuncio 0
Montalvo. 0

In 0
the 0
letter, 0
Father 0
Ramsey, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
professor 0
at 0
the 0
diocesan 0
seminary 0
in 0
Newark 0
from 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
’80s 0
until 0
1996, 0
affirms 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
recurring 0
rumor 0
in 0
the 0
seminary 0
that 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
“shared 0
his 0
bed 0
with 0
seminarians,” 0
inviting 0
five 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
to 0
spend 0
the 0
weekend 0
with 0
him 0
at 0
his 0
beach 0
house. 0

And 0
he 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
a 0
certain 0
number 0
of 0
seminarians, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
were 0
later 0
ordained 0
priests 0
for 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
Newark, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
invited 0
to 0
this 0
beach 0
house 0
and 0
had 0
shared 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
the 0
Archbishop. 0

The 0
office 0
that 0
I 0
held 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
was 0
not 0
informed 0
of 0
any 0
measure 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
after 0
those 0
charges 0
were 0
brought 0
by 0
Nuncio 0
Montalvo 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
2000, 0
when 0
Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
was 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

Likewise, 0
Nuncio 0
Sambi 0
transmitted 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
an 0
Indictment 0
Memorandum 0
against 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
the 0
priest 0
Gregory 0
Littleton 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
of 0
Charlotte, 0
who 0
was 0
reduced 0
to 0
the 0
lay 0
state 0
for 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
minors, 0
together 0
with 0
two 0
documents 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
Littleton, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
recounted 0
his 0
tragic 1
story 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
the 0
then-Archbishop 0
of 0
Newark 0
and 0
several 0
other 0
priests 0
and 0
seminarians. 0

The 0
Nuncio 0
added 0
that 0
Littleton 0
had 0
already 0
forwarded 0
his 0
Memorandum 0
to 0
about 0
twenty 0
people, 0
including 0
civil 0
and 0
ecclesiastical 0
judicial 0
authorities, 0
police 0
and 0
lawyers, 0
in 0
June 0
2006, 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
therefore 0
very 0
likely 0
that 0
the 0
news 0
would 0
soon 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

He 0
therefore 0
called 0
for 0
a 0
prompt 0
intervention 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

In 0
writing 0
up 0
a 0
memo[1] 0
on 0
these 0
documents 0
that 0
were 0
entrusted 0
to 0
me, 0
as 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations, 0
on 0
December 0
6, 0
2006, 0
I 0
wrote 0
to 0
my 0
superiors, 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone 0
and 0
the 0
Substitute 0
Leonardo 0
Sandri, 0
that 0
the 0
facts 0
attributed 0
to 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
Littleton 0
were 0
of 0
such 0
gravity 0
and 0
vileness 0
as 0
to 0
provoke 0
bewilderment, 0
a 0
sense 0
of 0
disgust, 1
deep 1
sorrow 1
and 0
bitterness 0
in 0
the 0
reader, 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
constituted 0
the 0
crimes 0
of 0
seducing, 0
requesting 0
depraved 0
acts 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests, 0
repeatedly 0
and 0
simultaneously 0
with 0
several 0
people, 0
derision 0
of 0
a 0
young 0
seminarian 0
who 0
tried 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
Archbishop’s 0
seductions 0
in 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
two 0
other 0
priests, 0
absolution 0
of 0
the 0
accomplices 0
in 0
these 0
depraved 0
acts, 0
sacrilegious 0
celebration 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
priests 0
after 0
committing 0
such 0
acts. 0

In 0
my 0
memo, 0
which 0
I 0
delivered 0
on 0
that 0
same 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
to 0
my 0
direct 0
superior, 0
the 0
Substitute 0
Leonardo 0
Sandri, 0
I 0
proposed 0
the 0
following 0
considerations 0
and 0
course 0
of 0
action 0
to 0
my 0
superiors: 0

- 0
Given 0
that 0
it 0
seemed 0
a 0
new 0
scandal 0
of 0
particular 0
gravity, 0
as 0
it 0
regarded 0
a 0
cardinal, 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
added 0
to 0
the 0
many 0
scandals 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0

- 0
and 0
that, 0
since 0
this 0
matter 0
had 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
a 0
cardinal, 0
and 0
according 0
to 0
can. 0

1405 0
§ 0
1, 0
No. 0

2˚, 0
“ipsius 0
Romani 0
Pontificis 0
dumtaxat 0
ius 0
est 0
iudicandi”; 0

- 0
I 0
proposed 0
that 0
an 0
exemplary 0
measure 0
be 0
taken 0
against 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
that 0
could 0
have 0
a 0
medicinal 0
function, 0
to 0
prevent 0
future 0
abuses 0
against 0
innocent 0
victims 0
and 0
alleviate 0
the 0
very 0
serious 0
scandal 0
for 0
the 0
faithful, 0
who 0
despite 0
everything 0
continued 0
to 0
love 0
and 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

I 0
added 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
salutary 0
if, 0
for 0
once, 0
ecclesiastical 0
authority 0
would 0
intervene 0
before 0
the 0
civil 0
authorities 0
and, 0
if 0
possible, 0
before 0
the 0
scandal 0
had 0
broken 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
press. 0

This 0
could 0
have 0
restored 0
some 0
dignity 0
to 0
a 0
Church 0
so 0
sorely 0
tried 0
and 0
humiliated 0
by 0
so 0
many 0
abominable 0
acts 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
some 0
pastors. 0

If 0
this 0
were 0
done, 0
the 0
civil 0
authority 0
would 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
to 0
judge 0
a 0
cardinal, 0
but 0
a 0
pastor 0
with 0
whom 0
the 0
Church 0
had 0
already 0
taken 0
appropriate 0
measures 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
cardinal 0
from 0
abusing 0
his 0
authority 0
and 0
continuing 0
to 0
destroy 1
innocent 0
victims. 0

My 0
memo 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
was 0
kept 0
by 0
my 0
superiors, 0
and 0
was 0
never 0
returned 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
any 0
actual 0
decision 0
by 0
the 0
superiors 0
on 0
this 0
matter. 0

passed 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
Cardinal 0
William 0
Levada, 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone. 0

It 0
was 0
delivered 0
to 0
me 0
one 0
month 0
later, 0
on 0
May 0
24, 0
2008. 0

The 0
following 0
day, 0
I 0
delivered 0
a 0
new 0
memo 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Substitute, 0
Fernando 0
Filoni, 0
which 0
included 0
my 0
previous 0
one 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006. 0

In 0
it, 0
I 0
summarized 0
Richard 0
Sipe’s 0
document, 0
which 0
ended 0
with 0
this 0
respectful 0
and 0
heartfelt 0
appeal 0
to 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI: 0
“I 0
approach 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
with 0
due 0
reverence, 0
but 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
intensity 0
that 0
motivated 0
Peter 0
Damian 0
to 0
lay 0
out 0
before 0
your 0
predecessor, 0
Pope 0
Leo 0
IX, 0
a 0
description 0
of 0
the 0
condition 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
during 0
his 0
time. 0

The 0
problems 0
he 0
spoke 0
of 0
are 0
similar 0
and 0
as 0
great 0
now 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
as 0
they 0
were 0
then 0
in 0
Rome. 0

If 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
requests, 0
I 0
will 0
personally 0
submit 0
to 0
you 0
documentation 0
of 0
that 0
about 0
which 0
I 0
have 0
spoken.” 0

I 0
ended 0
my 0
memo 0
by 0
repeating 0
to 0
my 0
superiors 0
that 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
necessary 0
to 0
intervene 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible 0
by 0
removing 0
the 0
cardinal’s 0
hat 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
subjected 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
established 0
by 0
the 0
Code 0
of 0
Canon 0
Law, 0
which 0
also 0
provide 0
for 0
reduction 0
to 0
the 0
lay 0
state. 0

This 0
second 0
memo 0
of 0
mine 0
was 0
also 0
never 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
Personnel 0
Office, 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
greatly 1
dismayed 1
at 0
my 0
superiors 0
for 0
the 0
inconceivable 0
absence 0
of 0
any 0
measure 0
against 0
the 0
Cardinal, 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
continuing 0
lack 0
of 0
any 0
communication 0
with 0
me 0
since 0
my 0
first 0
memo 0
in 0
December 0
2006. 0

But 0
finally 0
I 0
learned 0
with 0
certainty, 0
through 0
Cardinal 0
Giovanni 0
Battista 0
Re, 0
then-Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
that 0
Richard 0
Sipe’s 0
courageous 1
and 1
meritorious 1
Statement 0
had 0
had 0
the 0
desired 0
result. 0

Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
imposed 0
on 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
sanctions 0
similar 0
to 0
those 0
now 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
by 0
Pope 0
Francis: 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
was 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
seminary 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
living, 0
he 0
was 0
forbidden 0
to 0
celebrate 0
[Mass] 0
in 0
public, 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
public 0
meetings, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures, 0
to 0
travel, 0
with 0
the 0
obligation 0
of 0
dedicating 0
himself 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
when 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
took 0
these 0
measures 0
against 0
McCarrick, 0
whether 0
in 0
2009 0
or 0
2010, 0
because 0
in 0
the 0
meantime 0
I 0
had 0
been 0
transferred 0
to 0
the 0
Governorate 0
of 0
Vatican 0
City 0
State, 0
just 0
as 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
who 0
was 0
responsible 0
for 0
this 0
incredible 1
delay. 0

I 0
certainly 0
do 0
not 0
believe 0
it 0
was 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
who 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
had 0
repeatedly 0
denounced 0
the 0
corruption 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
months 0
of 0
his 0
pontificate 0
had 0
already 0
taken 0
a 0
firm 0
stand 0
against 0
the 0
admission 0
into 0
seminary 0
of 0
young 0
men 0
with 0
deep 0
homosexual 0
tendencies. 0

I 0
believe 0
it 0
was 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
first 0
collaborator 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
who 0
notoriously 0
favored 0
promoting 0
homosexuals 0
into 0
positions 0
of 0
responsibility, 0
and 0
was 0
accustomed 0
to 0
managing 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
thought 0
appropriate 0
to 0
convey 0
to 0
the 0
Pope. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
what 0
is 0
certain 0
is 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
imposed 0
the 0
above 0
canonical 0
sanctions 0
on 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
communicated 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Pietro 0
Sambi. 0

Monsignor 0
Jean-François 0
Lantheaume, 0
then 0
first 0
Counsellor 0
of 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
Chargé 0
d'Affaires 0
a.i. 0

after 0
the 0
unexpected 0
death 0
of 0
Nuncio 0
Sambi 0
in 0
Baltimore, 0
told 0
me 0
when 0
I 0
arrived 0
in 0
Washington 0
— 0
and 0
he 0
is 0
ready 0
to 0
testify 0
to 0
it— 0
about 0
a 0
stormy 0
conversation, 0
lasting 0
over 0
an 0
hour, 0
that 0
Nuncio 0
Sambi 0
had 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
whom 0
he 0
had 0
summoned 0
to 0
the 0
Nunciature. 0

Monsignor 0
Lantheaume 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
“the 0
Nuncio’s 0
voice 0
could 0
be 0
heard 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
corridor.” 0

Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
same 0
dispositions 0
were 0
then 0
also 0
communicated 0
to 0
me 0
by 0
the 0
new 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
Cardinal 0
Marc 0
Ouellet, 0
in 0
November 0
2011, 0
in 0
a 0
conversation 0
before 0
my 0
departure 0
for 0
Washington, 0
and 0
were 0
included 0
among 0
the 0
instructions 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Nuncio. 0

In 0
turn, 0
I 0
repeated 0
them 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
at 0
my 0
first 0
meeting 0
with 0
him 0
at 0
the 0
Nunciature. 0

The 0
Cardinal, 0
muttering 0
in 0
a 0
barely 0
comprehensible 0
way, 0
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
perhaps 0
made 0
the 0
mistake 0
of 0
sleeping 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
bed 0
with 0
some 0
seminarians 0
at 0
his 0
beach 0
house, 0
but 0
he 0
said 0
this 0
as 0
if 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
importance. 0

The 0
faithful 0
insistently 0
wonder 0
how 0
it 0
was 0
possible 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
be 0
appointed 0
to 0
Washington, 0
and 0
as 0
Cardinal, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
every 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
who 0
knew, 0
and 0
who 0
covered 0
up 0
his 0
grave 1
misdeeds. 1

It 0
is 0
therefore 0
my 0
duty 0
to 0
reveal 0
what 0
I 0
know 0
about 0
this, 0
beginning 0
with 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia. 0

Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
was 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
until 0
September 0
2006: 0
all 0
information 0
was 0
communicated 0
to 0
him. 0

In 0
November 0
2000, 0
Nunzio 0
Montalvo 0
sent 0
him 0
his 0
report, 0
passing 0
on 0
to 0
him 0
the 0
aforementioned 0
letter 0
from 0
Father 0
Boniface 0
Ramsey 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
denounced 0
the 0
serious 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

It 0
is 0
known 0
that 0
Sodano 0
tried 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
Father 0
Maciel 0
scandal 0
to 0
the 0
end. 0

He 0
even 0
removed 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
Justo 0
Mullor, 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
accomplice 0
in 0
his 0
scheme 0
to 0
cover 0
Maciel, 0
and 0
in 0
his 0
place 0
appointed 0
Sandri, 0
then-Nuncio 0
to 0
Venezuela, 0
who 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
collaborate 0
in 0
the 0
cover-up. 0

Sodano 0
even 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
issue 0
a 0
statement 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
press 0
office 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
falsehood 0
was 0
affirmed, 0
that 0
is, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
Maciel 0
case 0
should 0
be 0
considered 0
closed. 0

Benedict 0
reacted, 0
despite 0
Sodano’s 0
strenuous 0
defense, 0
and 0
Maciel 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
and 0
irrevocably 0
condemned. 0

Was 0
McCarrick’s 0
appointment 0
to 0
Washington 0
and 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Sodano, 0
when 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
was 0
already 0
very 0
ill? 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
given 0
to 0
know. 0

However, 0
it 0
is 0
legitimate 0
to 0
think 0
so, 0
but 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
think 0
he 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
responsible 0
for 0
this. 0

McCarrick 0
frequently 0
went 0
to 0
Rome 0
and 0
made 0
friends 0
everywhere, 0
at 0
all 0
levels 0
of 0
the 0
Curia. 0

If 0
Sodano 0
had 0
protected 0
Maciel, 0
as 0
seems 0
certain, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
reason 0
why 0
he 0
wouldn’t 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
for 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
according 0
to 0
many 0
had 0
the 0
financial 0
means 0
to 0
influence 0
decisions. 0

His 0
nomination 0
to 0
Washington 0
was 0
opposed 0
by 0
then-Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
Cardinal 0
Giovanni 0
Battista 0
Re. 0

At 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
note, 0
written 0
in 0
his 0
hand, 0
in 0
which 0
Cardinal 0
Re 0
disassociates 0
himself 0
from 0
the 0
appointment 0
and 0
states 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
14th 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
for 0
Washington. 0

Nuncio 0
Sambi’s 0
report, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
attachments, 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

My 0
two 0
above-mentioned 0
memos 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
and 0
May 0
25, 0
2008, 0
were 0
also 0
presumably 0
handed 0
over 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
the 0
Substitute. 0

As 0
already 0
mentioned, 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
had 0
no 0
difficulty 0
in 0
insistently 0
presenting 0
for 0
the 0
episcopate 0
candidates 0
known 0
to 0
be 0
active 0
homosexuals 0
— 0
I 0
cite 0
only 0
the 0
well-known 0
case 0
of 0
Vincenzo 0
de 0
Mauro, 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
Archbishop-Bishop 0
of 0
Vigevano 0
and 0
later 0
removed 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
undermining 0
his 0
seminarians 0
— 0
and 0
in 0
filtering 0
and 0
manipulating 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
conveyed 0
to 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

Cardinal 0
Pietro 0
Parolin, 0
the 0
current 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
was 0
also 0
complicit 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
misdeeds 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
who 0
had, 0
after 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
boasted 0
openly 0
of 0
his 0
travels 0
and 0
missions 0
to 0
various 0
continents. 0

In 0
April 0
2014, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Times 0
had 0
a 0
front 0
page 0
report 0
on 0
McCarrick’s 0
trip 0
to 0
the 0
Central 0
African 0
Republic, 0
and 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
no 0
less. 0

As 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
Washington, 0
I 0
wrote 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin 0
asking 0
him 0
if 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
were 0
still 0
valid. 0

Ça 0
va 0
sans 0
dire 0
that 0
my 0
letter 0
never 0
received 0
any 0
reply! 0

The 0
same 0
can 0
be 0
said 0
for 0
Cardinal 0
William 0
Levada, 0
former 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
for 0
Cardinals 0
Marc 0
Ouellet, 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
Lorenzo 0
Baldisseri, 0
former 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
and 0
Archbishop 0
Ilson 0
de 0
Jesus 0
Montanari, 0
current 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation. 0

They 0
were 0
all 0
aware 0
by 0
reason 0
of 0
their 0
office 0
of 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
on 0
McCarrick. 0

Cardinals 0
Leonardo 0
Sandri, 0
Fernando 0
Filoni 0
and 0
Angelo 0
Becciu, 0
as 0
Substitutes 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State, 0
knew 0
in 0
every 0
detail 0
the 0
situation 0
regarding 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

Nor 0
could 0
Cardinals 0
Giovanni 0
Lajolo 0
and 0
Dominique 0
Mamberti 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
know. 0

As 0
Secretaries 0
for 0
Relations 0
with 0
States, 0
they 0
participated 0
several 0
times 0
a 0
week 0
in 0
collegial 0
meetings 0
with 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

As 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia 0
is 0
concerned, 0
for 0
the 0
moment 0
I 0
will 0
stop 0
here, 0
even 0
if 0
the 0
names 0
of 0
other 0
prelates 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
are 0
well 0
known, 0
even 0
some 0
very 0
close 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
such 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
Francesco 0
Coccopalmerio 0
and 0
Archbishop 0
Vincenzo 0
Paglia, 0
who 0
belong 0
to 0
the 0
homosexual 0
current 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
subverting 0
Catholic 0
doctrine 0
on 0
homosexuality, 0
a 0
current 0
already 0
denounced 0
in 0
1986 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger, 0
then-Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
in 0
the 0
Letter 0
to 0
the 0
Bishops 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
on 0
the 0
Pastoral 0
Care 0
of 0
Homosexual 0
Persons. 0

Cardinals 0
Edwin 0
Frederick 0
O’Brien 0
and 0
Renato 0
Raffaele 0
Martino 0
also 0
belong 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
current, 0
albeit 0
with 0
a 0
different 0
ideology. 0

Others 0
belonging 0
to 0
this 0
current 0
even 0
reside 0
at 0
the 0
Domus 0
Sanctae 0
Marthae. 0

Now 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Obviously, 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
informed 0
of 0
the 0
measures 0
taken 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
was 0
McCarrick’s 0
successor 0
in 0
Washington 0
See, 0
Cardinal 0
Donald 0
Wuerl, 0
whose 0
situation 0
is 0
now 0
completely 0
compromised 0
by 0
the 0
recent 0
revelations 0
regarding 0
his 0
behavior 0
as 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Pittsburgh. 0

It 0
is 0
absolutely 0
unthinkable 0
that 0
Nunzio 0
Sambi, 0
who 0
was 0
an 0
extremely 0
responsible 0
person, 0
loyal, 0
direct 0
and 0
explicit 0
in 0
his 0
way 0
of 0
being 0
(a 0
true 0
son 0
of 0
Romagna) 0
did 0
not 0
speak 0
to 0
him 0
about 0
it. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
I 0
myself 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
subject 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
on 0
several 0
occasions, 0
and 0
I 0
certainly 0
didn’t 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
into 0
detail 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
immediately 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
it. 0

I 0
also 0
remember 0
in 0
particular 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
draw 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
it, 0
because 0
I 0
realized 0
that 0
in 0
an 0
archdiocesan 0
publication, 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
cover 0
in 0
color, 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
announcement 0
inviting 0
young 0
men 0
who 0
thought 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
vocation 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

I 0
immediately 0
phoned 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
who 0
expressed 0
his 0
surprise 0
to 0
me, 0
telling 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
that 0
announcement 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
cancel 0
it. 0

If, 0
as 0
he 0
now 0
continues 0
to 0
state, 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
of 0
the 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
measures 0
taken 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
how 0
can 0
his 0
answer 0
be 0
explained? 0

His 0
recent 0
statements 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it, 0
even 0
though 0
at 0
first 0
he 0
cunningly 0
referred 0
to 0
compensation 0
for 0
the 0
two 0
victims, 0
are 0
absolutely 1
laughable. 1

The 0
Cardinal 0
lies 0
shamelessly 1
and 0
prevails 0
upon 0
his 0
Chancellor, 0
Monsignor 0
Antonicelli, 0
to 0
lie 0
as 0
well. 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
also 0
clearly 0
lied 0
on 0
another 0
occasion. 0

Following 0
a 0
morally 0
unacceptable 0
event 0
authorized 0
by 0
the 0
academic 0
authorities 0
of 0
Georgetown 0
University, 0
I 0
brought 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
its 0
President, 0
Dr. 0
John 0
DeGioia, 0
sending 0
him 0
two 0
subsequent 0
letters. 0

Before 0
forwarding 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
addressee, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
handle 0
things 0
properly, 0
I 0
personally 0
gave 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
with 0
an 0
accompanying 0
letter 0
I 0
had 0
written. 0

The 0
Cardinal 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it. 0

However, 0
he 0
failed 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
receipt 0
of 0
my 0
two 0
letters, 0
contrary 0
to 0
what 0
he 0
customarily 0
did. 0

I 0
subsequently 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
event 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
had 0
taken 0
place 0
for 0
seven 0
years. 0

But 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it! 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
continuous 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
transgressing 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
order, 0
also 0
allowed 0
him 0
to 0
reside 0
at 0
a 0
seminary 0
in 0
Washington 0
D.C. 0

In 0
doing 0
so, 0
he 0
put 0
other 0
seminarians 0
at 0
risk. 0

Bishop 0
Paul 0
Bootkoski, 0
emeritus 0
of 0
Metuchen, 0
and 0
Archbishop 0
John 0
Myers, 0
emeritus 0
of 0
Newark, 0
covered 0
up 0
the 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick 0
in 0
their 0
respective 0
dioceses 0
and 0
compensated 0
two 0
of 0
his 0
victims. 0

They 0
cannot 0
deny 0
it 0
and 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
interrogated 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
reveal 0
every 0
circumstance 0
and 0
all 0
responsibility 0
regarding 0
this 0
matter. 0

Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
who 0
was 0
recently 0
interviewed 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
have 0
the 0
slightest 0
idea 0
about 0
the 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

Given 0
his 0
tenure 0
in 0
Washington, 0
Dallas 0
and 0
now 0
Rome, 0
I 0
think 0
no 0
one 0
can 0
honestly 0
believe 0
him. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
he 0
was 0
ever 0
asked 0
if 0
he 0
knew 0
about 0
Maciel’s 0
crimes. 0

If 0
he 0
were 0
to 0
deny 0
this, 0
would 0
anybody 0
believe 0
him 0
given 0
that 0
he 0
occupied 0
positions 0
of 0
responsibility 0
as 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ? 0

Regarding 0
Cardinal 0
Sean 0
O’Malley, 0
I 0
would 0
simply 0
say 0
that 0
his 0
latest 0
statements 0
on 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
case 0
are 0
disconcerting, 1
and 0
have 0
totally 1
obscured 0
his 0
transparency 0
and 0
credibility. 0

* 0
* 0
* 0

My 0
conscience 0
requires 0
me 0
also 0
to 0
reveal 0
facts 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
experienced 0
personally, 0
concerning 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
that 0
have 0
a 0
dramatic 1
significance, 0
which 0
as 0
Bishop, 0
sharing 0
the 0
collegial 0
responsibility 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
bishops 0
for 0
the 0
universal 0
Church, 0
do 0
not 0
allow 0
me 0
to 0
remain 0
silent, 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
state 0
here, 0
ready 0
to 0
reaffirm 0
them 0
under 0
oath 0
by 0
calling 0
on 0
God 0
as 0
my 0
witness. 0

In 0
the 0
last 0
months 0
of 0
his 0
pontificate, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
had 0
convened 0
a 0
meeting 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
apostolic 0
nuncios 0
in 0
Rome, 0
as 0
Paul 0
VI 0
and 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
had 0
done 0
on 0
several 0
occasions. 0

The 0
date 0
set 0
for 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
the 0
Pope 0
was 0
Friday, 0
June 0
21, 0
2013. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
kept 0
this 0
commitment 0
made 0
by 0
his 0
predecessor. 0

Of 0
course 0
I 0
also 0
came 0
to 0
Rome 0
from 0
Washington. 0

It 0
was 0
my 0
first 0
meeting 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
Pope 0
elected 0
only 0
three 0
months 0
prior, 0
after 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

On 0
the 0
morning 0
of 0
Thursday, 0
June 0
20, 0
2013, 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
Domus 0
Sanctae 0
Marthae, 0
to 0
join 0
my 0
colleagues 0
who 0
were 0
staying 0
there. 0

As 0
soon 0
as 0
I 0
entered 0
the 0
hall 0
I 0
met 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
wore 0
the 0
red-trimmed 0
cassock. 0

I 0
greeted 0
him 0
respectfully 0
as 0
I 0
had 0
always 0
done. 0

He 0
immediately 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
in 0
a 0
tone 0
somewhere 0
between 0
ambiguous 0
and 0
triumphant: 0
“The 0
Pope 0
received 0
me 0
yesterday, 0
tomorrow 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
China.” 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
I 0
knew 0
nothing 0
of 0
his 0
long 0
friendship 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Bergoglio 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
important 0
part 0
he 0
had 0
played 0
in 0
his 0
recent 0
election, 0
as 0
McCarrick 0
himself 0
would 0
later 0
reveal 0
in 0
a 0
lecture 0
at 0
Villanova 0
University 0
and 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter. 0

Nor 0
had 0
I 0
ever 0
thought 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
participated 0
in 0
the 0
preliminary 0
meetings 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
conclave, 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
role 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
have 0
as 0
a 0
cardinal 0
elector 0
in 0
the 0
2005 0
conclave. 0

Therefore 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
immediately 0
grasp 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
the 0
encrypted 0
message 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
communicated 0
to 0
me, 0
but 0
that 0
would 0
become 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
in 0
the 0
days 0
immediately 0
following. 0

The 0
next 0
day 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
took 0
place. 0

After 0
his 0
address, 0
which 0
was 0
partly 0
read 0
and 0
partly 0
delivered 0
off 0
the 0
cuff, 0
the 0
Pope 0
wished 0
to 0
greet 0
all 0
the 0
nuncios 0
one 0
by 0
one. 0

In 0
single 0
file, 0
I 0
remember 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
among 0
the 0
last. 0

When 0
it 0
was 0
my 0
turn, 0
I 0
just 0
had 0
time 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
him, 0
“I 0
am 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0
He 0
immediately 0
assailed 0
me 0
with 0
a 0
tone 0
of 0
reproach, 0
using 0
these 0
words: 0
“The 0
Bishops 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
ideologized! 0

They 0
must 0
be 0
shepherds!”Of 0
course 0
I 0
was 0
not 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
explanations 0
about 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
his 0
words 0
and 0
the 0
aggressive 1
way 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
had 0
upbraided 0
me. 0

I 0
had 0
in 0
my 0
hand 0
a 0
book 0
in 0
Portuguese 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
had 0
sent 0
me 0
for 0
the 0
Pope 0
a 0
few 0
days 0
earlier, 0
telling 0
me 0
“so 0
he 0
could 0
go 0
over 0
his 0
Portuguese 0
before 0
going 0
to 0
Rio 0
for 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day.” 0
I 0
handed 0
it 0
to 0
him 0
immediately, 0
and 0
so 0
freed 0
myself 0
from 0
that 0
extremely 0
disconcerting 0
and 0
embarrassing 0
situation. 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
audience 0
the 0
Pope 0
announced: 0
“Those 0
of 0
you 0
who 0
are 0
still 0
in 0
Rome 0
next 0
Sunday 0
are 0
invited 0
to 0
concelebrate 0
with 0
me 0
at 0
the 0
Domus 0
Sanctae 0
Marthae.” 0
I 0
naturally 0
thought 0
of 0
staying 0
on 0
to 0
clarify 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible 0
what 0
the 0
Pope 0
intended 0
to 0
tell 0
me. 0

On 0
Sunday 0
June 0
23, 0
before 0
the 0
concelebration 0
with 0
the 0
Pope, 0
I 0
asked 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca, 0
who 0
as 0
the 0
person 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
house 0
helped 0
us 0
put 0
on 0
the 0
vestments, 0
if 0
he 0
could 0
ask 0
the 0
Pope 0
if 0
he 0
could 0
receive 0
me 0
sometime 0
in 0
the 0
following 0
week. 0

How 0
could 0
I 0
have 0
returned 0
to 0
Washington 0
without 0
having 0
clarified 0
what 0
the 0
Pope 0
wanted 0
of 0
me? 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
Mass, 0
while 0
the 0
Pope 0
was 0
greeting 0
the 0
few 0
lay 0
people 0
present, 0
Monsignor 0
Fabian 0
Pedacchio, 0
his 0
Argentine 0
secretary, 0
came 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
said: 0
“The 0
Pope 0
told 0
me 0
to 0
ask 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
free 0
now!” 0
Naturally, 0
I 0
replied 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
disposal 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
thanked 0
him 0
for 0
receiving 0
me 0
immediately. 0

The 0
Pope 0
took 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
first 0
floor 0
in 0
his 0
apartment 0
and 0
said: 0
“We 0
have 0
40 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
Angelus.” 0

I 0
began 0
the 0
conversation, 0
asking 0
the 0
Pope 0
what 0
he 0
intended 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
the 0
words 0
he 0
had 0
addressed 0
to 0
me 0
when 0
I 0
greeted 0
him 0
the 0
previous 0
Friday. 0

And 0
the 0
Pope, 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
different, 0
friendly, 0
almost 0
affectionate 0
tone, 0
said 0
to 0
me: 0
“Yes, 0
the 0
Bishops 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
ideologized, 0
they 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
right-wing 0
like 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Philadelphia, 0
(the 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
give 0
me 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Archbishop) 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
shepherds; 0
and 0
they 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
left-wing 0
— 0
and 0
he 0
added, 0
raising 0
both 0
arms 0
— 0
and 0
when 0
I 0
say 0
left-wing 0
I 0
mean 0
homosexual.” 0
Of 0
course, 0
the 0
logic 0
of 0
the 0
correlation 0
between 0
being 0
left-wing 0
and 0
being 0
homosexual 0
escaped 0
me, 0
but 0
I 0
added 0
nothing 0
else. 0

Immediately 0
after, 0
the 0
Pope 0
asked 0
me 0
in 0
a 0
deceitful 0
way: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
I 0
answered 0
him 0
with 0
complete 0
frankness 0
and, 0
if 0
you 0
want, 0
with 0
great 0
naiveté: 0
“Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
you 0
know 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick, 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
ask 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
dossier 0
this 0
thick 0
about 0
him. 0

He 0
corrupted 0
generations 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests 0
and 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
ordered 0
him 0
to 0
withdraw 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance.” 0
The 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
the 0
slightest 0
comment 0
about 0
those 0
very 1
grave 1
words 0
of 0
mine 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
any 0
expression 0
of 0
surprise 0
on 0
his 0
face, 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
known 0
the 0
matter 0
for 0
some 0
time, 0
and 0
he 0
immediately 0
changed 0
the 0
subject. 0

But 0
then, 0
what 0
was 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
purpose 0
in 0
asking 0
me 0
that 0
question: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
He 0
clearly 0
wanted 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
if 0
I 0
was 0
an 0
ally 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
or 0
not. 0

Back 0
in 0
Washington 0
everything 0
became 0
very 0
clear 0
to 0
me, 0
thanks 0
also 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
event 0
that 0
occurred 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
days 0
after 0
my 0
meeting 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

When 0
the 0
new 0
Bishop 0
Mark 0
Seitz 0
took 0
possession 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
El 0
Paso 0
on 0
July 0
9, 0
2013, 0
I 0
sent 0
the 0
first 0
Counsellor, 0
Monsignor 0
Jean-François 0
Lantheaume, 0
while 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
Dallas 0
that 0
same 0
day 0
for 0
an 0
international 0
meeting 0
on 0
Bioethics. 0

When 0
he 0
got 0
back, 0
Monsignor 0
Lantheaume 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
in 0
El 0
Paso 0
he 0
had 0
met 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
who, 0
taking 0
him 0
aside, 0
told 0
him 0
almost 0
the 0
same 0
words 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
had 0
said 0
to 0
me 0
in 0
Rome: 0
“the 0
Bishops 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
ideologized, 0
they 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
right-wing, 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
shepherds….” 0
I 0
was 0
astounded! 0

It 0
was 0
therefore 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
reproach 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
had 0
addressed 0
to 0
me 0
on 0
June 0
21, 0
2013 0
had 0
been 0
put 0
into 0
his 0
mouth 0
the 0
day 0
before 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

Also 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
mention 0
“not 0
like 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Philadelphia” 0
could 0
be 0
traced 0
to 0
McCarrick, 0
because 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
strong 0
disagreement 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
of 0
them 0
about 0
the 0
admission 0
to 0
Communion 0
of 0
pro-abortion 0
politicians. 0

In 0
his 0
communication 0
to 0
the 0
bishops, 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
manipulated 0
a 0
letter 0
of 0
then-Cardinal 0
Ratzinger 0
who 0
prohibited 0
giving 0
them 0
Communion. 0

Indeed, 0
I 0
also 0
knew 0
how 0
certain 0
Cardinals 0
such 0
as 0
Mahony, 0
Levada 0
and 0
Wuerl, 0
were 0
closely 0
linked 0
to 0
McCarrick; 0
they 0
had 0
opposed 0
the 0
most 0
recent 0
appointments 0
made 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
for 0
important 0
posts 0
such 0
as 0
Philadelphia, 0
Baltimore, 0
Denver 0
and 0
San 0
Francisco. 0

Not 0
happy 0
with 0
the 0
trap 0
he 0
had 0
set 0
for 0
me 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013, 0
when 0
he 0
asked 0
me 0
about 0
McCarrick, 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
months 0
later, 0
in 0
the 0
audience 0
he 0
granted 0
me 0
on 0
October 0
10, 0
2013, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
set 0
a 0
second 0
one 0
for 0
me, 0
this 0
time 0
concerning 0
a 0
second 0
of 0
his 0
protégés, 0
Cardinal 0
Donald 0
Wuerl. 0

He 0
asked 0
me: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
like, 0
is 0
he 0
good 0
or 0
bad?” 0
I 0
replied, 0
“Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
tell 0
you 0
if 0
he 0
is 0
good 0
or 0
bad, 0
but 0
I 0
will 0
tell 0
you 0
two 0
facts.” 0
They 0
are 0
the 0
ones 0
I 0
have 0
already 0
mentioned 0
above, 0
which 0
concern 0
Wuerl’s 0
pastoral 1
carelessness 1
regarding 0
the 0
aberrant 0
deviations 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
University 0
and 0
the 0
invitation 0
by 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
Washington 0
to 0
young 0
aspirants 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
McCarrick! 0

Once 0
again 0
the 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
any 0
reaction. 0

It 0
was 0
also 0
clear 0
that, 0
from 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
election, 0
McCarrick, 0
now 0
free 0
from 0
all 0
constraints, 0
had 0
felt 0
free 0
to 0
travel 0
continuously, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures 0
and 0
interviews. 0

In 0
a 0
team 0
effort 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
he 0
had 0
become 0
the 0
kingmaker 0
for 0
appointments 0
in 0
the 0
Curia 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and 0
the 0
most 0
listened 0
to 0
advisor 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
for 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

This 0
is 0
how 0
one 0
explains 0
that, 0
as 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
the 0
Pope 0
replaced 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
with 0
Wuerl 0
and 0
immediately 0
appointed 0
Cupich 0
right 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
made 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

With 0
these 0
appointments 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
was 0
now 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
picture 0
in 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
bishops. 0

In 0
addition, 0
he 0
appointed 0
the 0
Brazilian 0
Ilson 0
de 0
Jesus 0
Montanari 0
— 0
the 0
great 0
friend 0
of 0
his 0
private 0
Argentine 0
secretary 0
Fabian 0
Pedacchio 0
— 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
and 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals, 0
promoting 0
him 0
in 0
one 0
single 0
leap 0
from 0
a 0
simple 0
official 0
of 0
that 0
department 0
to 0
Archbishop 0
Secretary. 0

Something 0
unprecedented 1
for 0
such 0
an 0
important 0
position! 0

The 0
appointments 0
of 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
to 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Joseph 0
W. 0
Tobin 0
to 0
Newark 0
were 0
orchestrated 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
Maradiaga 0
and 0
Wuerl, 0
united 0
by 0
a 0
wicked 1
pact 0
of 0
abuses 0
by 0
the 0
first, 0
and 0
at 0
least 0
of 0
coverup 0
of 0
abuses 0
by 0
the 0
other 0
two. 0

Their 0
names 0
were 0
not 0
among 0
those 0
presented 0
by 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
for 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Newark. 0

Regarding 0
Cupich, 0
one 0
cannot 0
fail 0
to 0
note 0
his 0
ostentatious 1
arrogance, 1
and 0
the 0
insolence 0
with 0
which 0
he 0
denies 0
the 0
evidence 0
that 0
is 0
now 0
obvious 0
to 0
all: 0
that 0
80% 0
of 0
the 0
abuses 0
found 0
were 0
committed 0
against 0
young 0
adults 0
by 0
homosexuals 0
who 0
were 0
in 0
a 0
relationship 0
of 0
authority 0
over 0
their 0
victims. 0

During 0
the 0
speech 0
he 0
gave 0
when 0
he 0
took 0
possession 0
of 0
the 0
Chicago 0
See, 0
at 0
which 0
I 0
was 0
present 0
as 0
a 0
representative 0
of 0
the 0
Pope, 0
Cupich 0
quipped 0
that 0
one 0
certainly 0
should 0
not 0
expect 0
the 0
new 0
Archbishop 0
to 0
walk 0
on 0
water. 0

Perhaps 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
remain 0
with 0
his 0
feet 0
on 0
the 0
ground 0
and 0
not 0
try 0
to 0
turn 0
reality 0
upside-down, 0
blinded 0
by 0
his 0
pro-gay 0
ideology, 0
as 0
he 0
stated 0
in 0
a 0
recent 0
interview 0
with 0
America 0
Magazine. 0

Extolling 0
his 0
particular 0
expertise 0
in 0
the 0
matter, 0
having 0
been 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
Protection 0
of 0
Children 0
and 0
Young 0
People 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
he 0
asserted 0
that 0
the 0
main 0
problem 0
in 0
the 0
crisis 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
is 0
not 0
homosexuality, 0
and 0
that 0
affirming 0
this 0
is 0
only 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
diverting 0
attention 0
from 0
the 0
real 0
problem 0
which 0
is 0
clericalism. 0

In 0
support 0
of 0
this 0
thesis, 0
Cupich 0
“oddly” 0
made 0
reference 0
to 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
research 0
carried 0
out 0
at 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
2000s, 0
while 0
he 0
“candidly” 0
ignored 0
that 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
that 0
investigation 0
were 0
totally 0
denied 0
by 0
the 0
subsequent 0
Independent 0
Reports 0
by 0
the 0
John 0
Jay 0
College 0
of 0
Criminal 0
Justice 0
in 0
2004 0
and 0
2011, 0
which 0
concluded 0
that, 0
in 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
81% 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
were 0
male. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Father 0
Hans 0
Zollner, 0
S.J., 0
Vice-Rector 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Gregorian 0
University, 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Centre 0
for 0
Child 0
Protection, 0
and 0
Member 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Commission 0
for 0
the 0
Protection 0
of 0
Minors, 0
recently 0
told 0
the 0
newspaper 0
La 0
Stampa 0
that 0
“in 0
most 0
cases 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
question 0
of 0
homosexual 0
abuse.” 0

The 0
appointment 0
of 0
McElroy 0
in 0
San 0
Diego 0
was 0
also 0
orchestrated 0
from 0
above, 0
with 0
an 0
encrypted 0
peremptory 0
order 0
to 0
me 0
as 0
Nuncio, 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin: 0
“Reserve 0
the 0
See 0
of 0
San 0
Diego 0
for 0
McElroy.” 0
McElroy 0
was 0
also 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses, 0
as 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
from 0
a 0
letter 0
sent 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
Richard 0
Sipe 0
on 0
July 0
28, 0
2016. 0

These 0
characters 0
are 0
closely 0
associated 0
with 0
individuals 0
belonging 0
in 0
particular 0
to 0
the 0
deviated 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
Jesus, 0
unfortunately 0
today 0
a 0
majority, 0
which 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
a 0
cause 0
of 0
serious 0
concern 0
to 0
Paul 0
VI 0
and 0
subsequent 0
pontiffs. 0

We 0
need 0
only 0
consider 0
Father 0
Robert 0
Drinan, 0
S.J., 0
who 0
was 0
elected 0
four 0
times 0
to 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives, 0
and 0
was 0
a 0
staunch 0
supporter 0
of 0
abortion; 0
or 0
Father 0
Vincent 0
O’Keefe, 0
S.J., 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
principal 0
promoters 0
of 0
The 0
Land 0
O’Lakes 0
Statement 0
of 0
1967, 0
which 0
seriously 0
compromised 0
the 0
Catholic 0
identity 0
of 0
universities 0
and 0
colleges 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
McCarrick, 0
then 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
University 0
of 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
also 0
participated 0
in 0
that 0
inauspicious 0
undertaking 0
which 0
was 0
so 0
harmful 0
to 0
the 0
formation 0
of 0
the 0
consciences 0
of 0
American 0
youth, 0
closely 0
associated 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
with 0
the 0
deviated 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Jesuits. 0

Father 0
James 0
Martin, 0
S.J., 0
acclaimed 0
by 0
the 0
people 0
mentioned 0
above, 0
in 0
particular 0
Cupich, 0
Tobin, 0
Farrell 0
and 0
McElroy, 0
appointed 0
Consultor 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
for 0
Communications, 0
well-known 0
activist 0
who 0
promotes 0
the 0
LGBT 0
agenda, 0
chosen 0
to 0
corrupt 0
the 0
young 0
people 0
who 0
will 0
soon 0
gather 0
in 0
Dublin 0
for 0
the 0
World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Families, 0
is 0
nothing 0
but 0
a 0
sad 0
recent 0
example 0
of 0
that 0
deviated 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
Jesus. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
asked 0
for 0
total 0
transparency 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
for 0
bishops 0
and 0
faithful 0
to 0
act 0
with 0
parrhesia. 0

The 0
faithful 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
also 0
demand 0
this 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
an 0
exemplary 0
manner. 0

He 0
must 0
honestly 0
state 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
learned 0
about 0
the 0
crimes 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
abused 0
his 0
authority 0
with 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
the 0
Pope 0
learned 0
about 0
it 0
from 0
me 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
and 0
continued 0
to 0
cover 0
for 0
him. 0

He 0
did 0
not 0
take 0
into 0
account 0
the 0
sanctions 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
and 0
made 0
him 0
his 0
trusted 0
counselor 0
along 0
with 0
Maradiaga. 0

The 0
latter 0
[Maradiaga] 0
is 0
so 0
confident 0
of 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
protection 0
that 0
he 0
can 0
dismiss 0
as 0
“gossip” 0
the 0
heartfelt 0
appeals 0
of 0
dozens 0
of 0
his 0
seminarians, 0
who 0
found 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
write 0
to 0
him 0
after 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
tried 0
to 0
commit 0
suicide 0
over 0
homosexual 0
abuse 0
in 0
the 0
seminary. 0

By 0
now 0
the 0
faithful 0
have 0
well 0
understood 0
Maradiaga’s 0
strategy: 0
insult 0
the 0
victims 0
to 0
save 0
himself, 0
lie 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
a 0
chasm 0
of 0
abuses 0
of 0
power, 0
of 0
mismanagement 0
in 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Church 0
property, 0
and 0
of 0
financial 0
disasters 1
even 0
against 0
close 0
friends, 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Ambassador 0
of 0
Honduras 0
Alejandro 0
Valladares, 0
former 0
Dean 0
of 0
the 0
Diplomatic 0
Corps 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

In 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
former 0
Auxiliary 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
José 0
Pineda, 0
after 0
the 0
article 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
[Italian] 0
weekly 0
L’Espresso 0
last 0
February, 0
Maradiaga 0
stated 0
in 0
the 0
newspaper 0
Avvenire: 0
“It 0
was 0
my 0
auxiliary 0
bishop 0
Pineda 0
who 0
asked 0
for 0
the 0
visitation, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
‘clear’ 0
his 0
name 0
after 0
being 0
subjected 0
to 0
much 0
slander.” 0
Now, 0
regarding 0
Pineda 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
public 0
is 0
that 0
his 0
resignation 0
has 0
simply 0
been 0
accepted, 0
thus 0
making 0
any 0
possible 0
responsibility 0
of 0
his 0
and 0
Maradiaga 0
vanish 0
into 0
nowhere. 0

In 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
transparency 0
so 0
hailed 0
by 0
the 0
Pope, 0
the 0
report 0
that 0
the 0
Visitator, 0
Argentine 0
bishop 0
Alcides 0
Casaretto, 0
delivered 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
ago 0
only 0
and 0
directly 0
to 0
the 0
Pope, 0
must 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

Finally, 0
the 0
recent 0
appointment 0
as 0
Substitute 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Edgar 0
Peña 0
Parra 0
is 0
also 0
connected 0
with 0
Honduras, 0
that 0
is, 0
with 0
Maradiaga. 0

From 0
2003 0
to 0
2007 0
Peña 0
Parra 0
worked 0
as 0
Counsellor 0
at 0
the 0
Tegucigalpa 0
Nunciature. 0

As 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations 0
I 0
received 0
worrisome 0
information 0
about 0
him. 0

In 0
Honduras, 0
a 0
scandal 0
as 0
huge 0
as 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
Chile 0
is 0
about 0
to 0
be 0
repeated. 0

The 0
Pope 0
defends 0
his 0
man, 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end, 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
done 0
in 0
Chile 0
with 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
de 0
la 0
Cruz 0
Barros, 0
whom 0
he 0
himself 0
had 0
appointed 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Osorno 0
against 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
Bishops. 0

First 0
he 0
insulted 0
the 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

Then, 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
and 0
a 0
revolt 0
by 0
the 0
Chilean 0
victims 0
and 0
faithful, 0
did 0
he 0
recognize 0
his 0
error 0
and 0
apologize, 0
while 0
stating 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misinformed, 0
causing 0
a 0
disastrous 1
situation 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Chile, 0
but 0
continuing 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
two 0
Chilean 0
Cardinals 0
Errazuriz 0
and 0
Ezzati. 0

Even 0
in 0
the 0
tragic 0
affair 0
of 0
McCarrick, 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
behavior 0
was 0
no 0
different. 0

He 0
knew 0
from 0
at 0
least 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
a 0
serial 1
predator. 1

Although 0
he 0
knew 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
corrupt 0
man, 0
he 0
covered 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end; 0
indeed, 0
he 0
made 0
McCarrick’s 0
advice 0
his 0
own, 0
which 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
inspired 0
by 0
sound 0
intentions 0
and 0
for 0
love 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

It 0
was 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
report 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
a 0
minor, 0
again 0
on 0
the 0
basis 0
of 0
media 0
attention, 0
that 0
he 0
took 0
action 0
[regarding 0
McCarrick] 0
to 0
save 0
his 0
image 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

Now 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
a 0
chorus 0
of 0
voices 0
is 0
rising 0
especially 0
from 0
the 0
lay 0
faithful, 0
and 0
has 0
recently 0
been 0
joined 0
by 0
several 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests, 0
asking 0
that 0
all 0
those 0
who, 0
by 0
their 0
silence, 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
criminal 0
behavior, 0
or 0
who 0
used 0
him 0
to 0
advance 0
their 0
career 0
or 0
promote 0
their 0
intentions, 0
ambitions 0
and 0
power 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
should 0
resign. 0

But 0
this 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
heal 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
extremely 1
grave 1
immoral 1
behavior 1
by 0
the 0
clergy: 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests. 0

A 0
time 0
of 0
conversion 0
and 0
penance 0
must 0
be 0
proclaimed. 0

The 0
virtue 0
of 0
chastity 0
must 0
be 0
recovered 0
in 0
the 0
clergy 0
and 0
in 0
seminaries. 0

Corruption 0
in 0
the 0
misuse 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
resources 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
offerings 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
must 0
be 0
fought 0
against. 0

The 0
seriousness 0
of 0
homosexual 0
behavior 0
must 0
be 0
denounced. 0

The 0
homosexual 0
networks 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
must 0
be 0
eradicated, 0
as 0
Janet 0
Smith, 0
Professor 0
of 0
Moral 0
Theology 0
at 0
the 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
Major 0
Seminary 0
in 0
Detroit, 0
recently 0
wrote. 0

“The 0
problem 0
of 0
clergy 0
abuse,” 0
she 0
wrote, 0
“cannot 0
be 0
resolved 0
simply 0
by 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
some 0
bishops, 0
and 0
even 0
less 0
so 0
by 0
bureaucratic 0
directives. 0

The 0
deeper 0
problem 0
lies 0
in 0
homosexual 0
networks 0
within 0
the 0
clergy 0
which 0
must 0
be 0
eradicated.” 0
These 0
homosexual 0
networks, 0
which 0
are 0
now 0
widespread 0
in 0
many 0
dioceses, 0
seminaries, 0
religious 0
orders, 0
etc., 0
act 0
under 0
the 0
concealment 0
of 0
secrecy 0
and 0
lies 0
with 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
octopus 0
tentacles, 0
and 0
strangle 0
innocent 0
victims 0
and 0
priestly 0
vocations, 0
and 0
are 0
strangling 0
the 0
entire 0
Church. 0

I 0
implore 0
everyone, 0
especially 0
Bishops, 0
to 0
speak 0
up 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
defeat 0
this 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
widespread, 0
and 0
to 0
report 0
the 0
cases 0
of 0
abuse 0
they 0
know 0
about 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
civil 0
authorities. 0

Let 0
us 0
heed 0
the 0
most 0
powerful 0
message 0
that 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
left 0
us 0
as 0
an 0
inheritance:Do 0
not 1
be 1
afraid! 1

Do 1
not 1
be 1
afraid! 1

In 0
his 0
2008 0
homily 0
on 0
the 0
Feast 0
of 0
the 0
Epiphany, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
reminded 0
us 0
that 0
the 0
Father’s 0
plan 0
of 0
salvation 0
had 0
been 0
fully 0
revealed 0
and 0
realized 0
in 0
the 0
mystery 0
of 0
Christ’s 0
death 0
and 0
resurrection, 0
but 0
it 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
welcomed 0
in 0
human 0
history, 0
which 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
history 0
of 0
fidelity 0
on 0
God’s 0
part 0
and 0
unfortunately 0
also 0
of 0
infidelity 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
us 0
men. 0

The 0
Church, 0
the 0
depositary 0
of 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Covenant, 0
signed 0
in 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
the 0
Lamb, 0
is 0
holy 0
but 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
sinners, 0
as 0
Saint 0
Ambrose 0
wrote: 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
“immaculata 0
ex 0
maculatis,” 0
she 0
is 0
holy 0
and 0
spotless 0
even 0
though, 0
in 0
her 0
earthly 0
journey, 0
she 0
is 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
men 0
stained 1
with 1
sin. 1

I 0
want 0
to 0
recall 0
this 0
indefectible 0
truth 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
holiness 0
to 0
the 0
many 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
so 0
deeply 1
scandalized 1
by 0
the 0
abominable 1
and 0
sacrilegious 0
behavior 0
of 0
the 0
former 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington, 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick; 0
by 0
the 0
grave, 0
disconcerting 0
and 0
sinful 1
conduct 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
of 0
so 0
many 0
pastors, 0
and 0
who 0
are 0
tempted 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Church, 0
disfigured 0
by 0
so 0
many 0
ignominies. 0

At 0
the 0
Angelus 0
on 0
Sunday, 0
August 0
12, 0
2018 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
said 0
these 0
words: 0
“Everyone 0
is 0
guilty 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
he 0
could 0
have 0
done 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
... 0

If 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
oppose 0
evil, 0
we 0
tacitly 0
feed 0
it. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
intervene 0
where 0
evil 0
is 0
spreading; 0
for 0
evil 0
spreads 0
where 0
daring 0
Christians 0
who 0
oppose 0
evil 0
with 0
good 0
are 0
lacking.” 0
If 0
this 0
is 0
rightly 0
to 0
be 0
considered 0
a 0
serious 0
moral 0
responsibility 0
for 0
every 0
believer, 0
how 0
much 0
graver 0
is 0
it 0
for 0
the 0
Church’s 0
supreme 0
pastor, 0
who 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
not 0
only 0
did 0
not 0
oppose 0
evil 0
but 0
associated 0
himself 0
in 0
doing 0
evil 0
with 0
someone 0
he 0
knew 0
to 0
be 0
deeply 0
corrupt. 0

He 0
followed 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
someone 0
he 0
knew 0
well 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
pervert, 1
thus 0
multiplying 0
exponentially 0
with 0
his 0
supreme 0
authority 0
the 0
evil 0
done 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

And 0
how 0
many 0
other 0
evil 0
pastors 0
is 0
Francis 0
still 0
continuing 0
to 0
prop 0
up 0
in 0
their 0
active 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
Church! 0

Francis 0
is 0
abdicating 0
the 0
mandate 0
which 0
Christ 0
gave 0
to 0
Peter 0
to 0
confirm 0
the 0
brethren. 0

Indeed, 0
by 0
his 0
action 0
he 0
has 0
divided 0
them, 0
led 0
them 0
into 0
error, 0
and 0
encouraged 0
the 0
wolves 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
tear 0
apart 0
the 0
sheep 0
of 0
Christ’s 0
flock. 0

In 0
this 0
extremely 0
dramatic 0
moment 0
for 0
the 0
universal 0
Church, 0
he 0
must 0
acknowledge 0
his 0
mistakes 0
and, 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
the 0
proclaimed 0
principle 0
of 0
zero 0
tolerance, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
must 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
set 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
for 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops 0
who 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses 0
and 0
resign 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

Even 0
in 0
dismay 0
and 0
sadness 0
over 0
the 0
enormity 0
of 0
what 0
is 0
happening, 0
let 0
us 0
not 0
lose 0
hope! 0

We 0
well 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
great 0
majority 0
of 0
our 0
pastors 0
live 0
their 0
priestly 0
vocation 0
with 0
fidelity 0
and 0
dedication. 0

It 0
is 0
in 0
moments 0
of 0
great 0
trial 0
that 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
grace 0
is 0
revealed 0
in 0
abundance 0
and 0
makes 0
His 0
limitless 0
mercy 0
available 0
to 0
all; 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
granted 0
only 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
truly 0
repentant 0
and 0
sincerely 0
propose 0
to 0
amend 0
their 0
lives. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
favorable 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
confess 0
her 0
sins, 0
to 0
convert, 0
and 0
to 0
do 0
penance. 0

Let 0
us 0
all 0
pray 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
Pope, 0
let 0
us 0
remember 0
how 0
many 0
times 0
he 0
has 0
asked 0
us 0
to 0
pray 0
for 0
him! 0

Let 0
us 0
all 0
renew 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
our 0
Mother: 0
“I 0
believe 0
in 0
one, 0
holy, 0
catholic 0
and 0
apostolic 0
Church!” 0

Christ 0
will 0
never 0
abandon 0
His 0
Church! 0

He 0
generated 0
her 0
in 0
His 0
Blood 0
and 0
continually 0
revives 0
her 0
with 0
His 0
Spirit! 0

Mary, 0
Mother 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
pray 1
for 1
us! 1

Mary, 0
Virgin 0
and 0
Queen, 0
Mother 0
of 0

of 0
glory, 0
