Kavanaugh 0
Nomination 0
Is 0
Exploding 1
in 1
Trump’s 1
Face 1

The 0
president 0
is 0
doubling 0
down 0
on 0
an 0
increasingly 0
risky 0
candidate. 0

Justice 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy 0
gave 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
the 1
biggest 1
political 1
gift 1
possible 1
when 0
he 0
announced 0
his 0
resignation 0
in 0
the 0
spring. 0

Even 0
though 0
not 0
everything 0
that’s 0
gone 0
wrong 0
is 0
Trump’s 0
fault, 0
he 0
has 0
managed 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
complete 1
hash 1
of 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
to 0
fill 0
the 0
empty 0
seat 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

It’s 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
of 0
how 1
badly 1
Trump 1
does 1
his 1
job 1
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
into 0
his 0
administration. 0

To 0

begin 0
with, 0
Trump 0
has 0
outsourced 0
his 0
judicial 0
nominations 0
to 0
outside, 0
party-aligned 0
groups, 0
the 0
Heritage 0
Foundation 0
and 0
the 0
Federalist 0
Society. 0

That 0
included 0
an 0
unusually 0
central 0
role 0
for 0
the 0
Federalist 0
Society’s 0
Leonard 0
Leo. 0

That 0

wasn’t 0
entirely 0
a 0
Trump 0
mistake. 0

His 0
decision 0
during 0
the 0
campaign 0
to 0
release 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
potential 0
justices 0
drafted 0
by 0
Leo 0
reflected 1
the 1
reality-TV 1
star’s 1
weakness 1
as 1
a 1
presidential 1
candidate. 1

The 0
party 0
was 0
worried 0
that 0
Trump 0
might 0
turn 0
out 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
conservative; 0
to 0
reassure 0
them, 0
he 0
publicly 0
committed 0
to 0
their 0
top 0
goal. 0

In 0
some 0
ways, 0
that’s 0
successful 0
coalition-building, 0
and 0
what 0
he’s 0
done 0
in 0
office 0
is 0
just 0
keeping 0
his 0
promises 0
on 0
judges. 0

Still, 0

it’s 0
one 0
thing 0
to 0
form 0
an 0
alliance 0
with 0
conservatives; 0
it’s 0
another 0
to 0
turn 0
the 0
whole 0
process 0
over 0
to 0
them. 0

We 0
don’t 0
know 0
to 0
what 0
extent 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
Trump’s 0
choice 0
and 0
to 0
what 0
extent 0
he 0
was 0
manipulated 0
into 0
choosing 0
him. 0

We 0
have 0
plenty 0
of 0
evidence 0
that 0
Trump 1
is 1
easily 1
manipulated 1
by 1
those 1
around 1
him, 1
and 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
fit 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
biases: 0
The 0
judge 0
has 0
Ivy 0
League 0
credentials 0
and 0
he 0
passes 0
Trump’s 0
cut-of-his-jib 1
test 1
by 0
looking 0
the 0
part. 0

1 0

Either 0

way, 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
a 0
poor 0
choice 0
from 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
view 0
of 0
good 0
presidenting. 0

The 0
judge 0
was 0
certain 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
highly 0
controversial 0
selection 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

After 0
all, 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
highly 0
controversial 0
selection 0
for 0
his 0
current 0
circuit 0
court 0
seat, 0
eventually 0
getting 0
confirmed 0
with 0
only 0
four 0
Democratic 0
votes 0
after 0
a 0
long 0
delay. 0

Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
longtime 0
Republican 0
operative, 0
a 0
hard-liner 0
during 0
both 0
the 0
Vince 0
Foster 0
and 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky 0
investigations. 0

Nominating 0
him, 0
rather 0
than 0
a 0
conservative 0
with 0
similar 0
views 0
but 0
a 0
different 0
background, 0
was 0
bound 0
to 0
stir 0
up 0
trouble. 0

It 0
was 0
also 0
true, 0
as 0
Senate 0
Majority 0
Leader 0
Mitch 0
McConnell 0
reportedly 0
warned, 0
that 0
normal 0
disclosure 0
of 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
record, 0
especially 0
his 0
service 0
during 0
the 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
administration, 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
delay 0
confirmation 0
even 0
more. 0

Senate 0
Republicans 0
dealt 0
with 0
that 0
problem 0
by 0
deciding 0
to 0
not 0
bother 0
with 0
any 0
Kavanaugh 0
documents 0
that 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
produced 0
rapidly, 0
which 0
further 0
riled 0
up 0
the 0
Democrats 0
and 0
gave 0
that 0
party 0
some 0
good 0
talking 0
points. 0

2 0

Sometimes 0

it’s 0

worth 0
taking 0
risks. 0

Presidents 0
who 0
shy 0
away 0
from 0
anything 0
that’s 0
not 0
a 0
sure 0
thing 0
can 0
fail 0
to 0
exploit 0
opportunities. 0

It’s 0
just 0
very 0
hard 0
to 0
see 0
any 0
upside 0
for 0
Trump 0
in 0
choosing 0
Kavanaugh 0
instead 0
of 0
a 0
safer, 0
but 0
still 0
very 0
conservative, 0
other 0
option. 0

3 0

When 0

serious 0
charges 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
were 0
raised 0
against 0
Kavanaugh, 0
Trump 0
decided 0
to 0
stick 0
with 0
him 0
instead 0
of 0
moving 0
on 0
to 0
another 0
candidate. 0

It’s 0
still 0
not 0
clear 0
that 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
is 0
doomed, 0
but 0
it’s 0
certainly 0
in 0
severe 1
trouble. 1

Losing 0
a 0
high-profile 0
fight 0
is 0
always 0
going 0
to 0
hurt 0
a 0
president, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
they 0
should 0
take 0
care 0
to 0
avoid 0
high-risk, 0
low-reward 0
conflicts. 0

But 0
there’s 0
an 0
art 0
to 0
minimizing 0
damage. 0

And 0
Trump 1
hasn’t 1
learned 1
it 1
yet. 1

For 0

one 0
thing, 0
the 0
president 0
has 0
made 0
this 0
an 0
extremely 1
high-profile 1
episode 1
by 0
stringing 0
out 0
the 0
process 0
as 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
gained 0
credibility 0
and 0
even 0
multiplied. 0

Whether 0
that 0
matters 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
public 0
opinion 0
for 0
Trump 0
is 0
unclear, 0
but 0
it 0
certainly 0
isn’t 0
good 0
for 0
any 0
Republican 0
senators 0
caught 0
up 0
in 0
the 0
middle, 0
along 0
with 0
any 0
other 0
candidates 0
who 0
have 0
had 0
to 0
weigh 0
in 0
only 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
facts 0
as 0
they 0
knew 0
them 0
constantly 0
changing. 0

It’s 0

also 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
the 0
more 0
negative 0
information 0
comes 0
out, 0
the 0
more 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 1
and 1
his 1
White 1
House 1
staff 1
failed 1
to 1
do 1
their 1
jobs 1
in 0
vetting 0
and 0
managing 0
Kavanaugh. 0

If 0
the 0
nomination 0
had 0
been 0
pulled 0
right 0
after 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
made 0
her 0
initial 0
assertions 0
about 0
Kavanaugh, 0
the 0
public 0
might 0
have 0
concluded 0
that 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
Trump’s 0
fault 0
that 0
a 0
previously 0
unaired 0
accusation 0
came 0
to 0
light. 0

Meanwhile, 0

Trump’s 0
behavior 0
has 0
been 0
as 0
erratic 0
as 0
ever. 0

First 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
Brasey 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
heard; 0
then 0
he 0
attacked 0
her 0
in 0
terms 0
that 0
were 0
a 1
slur 1
on 1
all 1
women 1
who 0
have 0
been 0
assaulted 0
without 0
immediately 0
reporting 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
police, 0
and 0
he 0
also 0
blamed 0
the 0
Senate 0
for 0
not 0
voting 0
before 0
she 0
came 0
forward. 0

He 0
sometimes 0
praises 0
Kavanaugh, 0
but 0
also 0
let 0
it 0
be 0
known 0
that 0
he 0
thought 0
the 0
nominee 0
had 0
performed 0
badly 0
in 0
his 0
Fox 0
News 0
interview. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
demanded 0
a 0
final 0
up 0
and 0
down 0
vote 0
on 0
Tuesday; 0
by 0
Wednesday, 0
he 0
was 0
saying 0
that 0
the 0
nomination 0
would 0
die 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
didn’t 0
do 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

The 0
sum 0
of 0
all 0
this 0
has 0
been, 0
as 0
in 0
many 0
other 0
episodes, 0
that 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
White 0
House 0
are 0
a 1
gang 1
that 1
can’t 1
shoot 1
straight 1
and 0
that 0
he’s 0
eager 0
to 0
blame 0
his 0
allies 0
and 0
lash 0
out 0
at 0
his 0
enemies 0
in 0
ugly 1
ways 1
when 0
things 0
go 0
wrong. 0

A 0

botched 0
nomination 0
matters 0
because 0
allies 0
will 0
be 0
less 0
likely 0
to 0
trust 0
Trump, 0
not 0
just 0
on 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
choices, 0
but 0
on 0
any 0
initiative. 0

And, 0
for 0
that 0
matter, 0
they’ll 0
be 0
less 0
likely 0
to 0
trust 0
him 0
when 0
he 0
asserts 0
that 0
there’s 0
nothing 0
remaining 0
for 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
to 0
reveal. 0

Trump’s 0
professional 0
reputation 0
is 0
already 0
terrible, 0
but 0
everything 0
counts. 0

As 1
the 1
political 1
scientist 1
Richard 1
Neustadt 1
said, 1
political 1
elites 1
are 1
constantly 1
evaluating 1
and 1
re-evaluating 1
the 1
president. 1

Trump 0
is 0
hurting 0
himself 0
right 0
now, 0
and 0
will 0
have 0
hurt 0
himself 0
more 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
not 0
confirmed. 0

And 0

yes, 0
I 0
call 0
it 0
the 0
cut-of-his-jib 1
test 1
quite 0
deliberately. 0

It's 0
no 0
surprise 0
that 0
someone 1
who 1
hires 1
based 1
on 1
what 1
he 1
thinks 1
someone 1
doing 1
that 1
job 1
should 1
look 1
like, 1
which 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
hazy 1
old-time 1
Hollywood 1
casting, 1
would 0
wind 0
up 0
with 0
fewer 0
women 0
in 0
his 0
administration 0
than 0
any 0
of 0
his 0
recent 0
predecessors. 0

I've 0

argued 0
that 0
too 0
much 0
disclosure 0
is 0
required, 0
and 0
that 0
Democrats 0
(and 0
any 0
wavering 0
Republicans) 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
enough 0
information 0
to 0
make 0
up 0
their 0
mind. 0

I 0
still 0
think 0
that's 0
true. 0

But 0
it 0
did 0
leave 0
Republicans 0
vulnerable 0
to 0
claims 0
about 0
transparency 0
which 0
were 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
popular 0
-- 0
most 0
people, 0
and 0
the 0
entire 0
press 0
corps, 0
love 0
transparency 0
-- 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
to 0
bombshells 1
in 0
the 0
documentary 0
record 0
which 0
hadn't 0
been 0
initially 0
disclosed. 0

In 0
the 0
event, 0
that's 0
not 0
what's 0
causing 0
the 0
trouble, 0
but 0
still 0
it's 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
Trump 0
taking 0
needless 0
risks. 0

Some 0

have 0
speculated 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
would 0
be 0
especially 0
likely 0
to 0
rule 0
in 0
Trump's 0
favor 0
if 0
any 0
cases 0
stemming 0
from 0
the 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
wind 0
up 0
at 0
the 0
high 0
court. 0

Perhaps. 0

There 0
are 0
plenty 0
of 0
other 0
partisan, 1
conservative 1
judges, 1
and 0
plenty 0
of 0
conservative 0
judges 0
who 0
lean 0
towards 0
an 0
expansive 0
view 0
of 0
presidential 0
powers. 0

And 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
really 0
an 0
outlier 0
on 0
that 0
issue, 0
then 0
he 0
won't 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
majority 0
on 0
any 0
future 0
decision 0
anyway. 0

So, 0
no, 0
I 0
don't 0
think 0
there's 0
any 0
good 0
reason 0
to 0
think 0
Kavanaugh 0
would 0
be 0
especially 0
helpful 0
to 0
Trump 0
compared 0
to 0
others 0
he 0
could 0
have 0
selected. 0
