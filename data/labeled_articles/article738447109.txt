The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
first 0
reported 0
on 0
the 0
story 0
prior 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
tweet. 0

Trump 0
and 0
Tillerson 0
have 0
had 0
a 0
fraught 0
relationship 0
for 0
many 0
months. 0

Trump 0
told 0
reporters 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
ultimately 0
decided 0
to 0
fire 0
the 0
secretary 0
because 0
they 0
disagreed 0
over 0
strategy 0
in 0
key 0
areas 0
of 0
foreign 0
policy, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
2015 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
the 0
approach 0
to 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
overall 0
tone 0
of 0
U.S. 0
diplomacy. 0

Tillerson 0
said 0
he 0
received 0
a 0
call 0
from 0
Trump 0
around 0
noon 0
Tuesday, 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
hours 0
after 0
his 0
firing 0
was 0
first 0
reported 0
by 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
announced 0
minutes 0
later 0
in 0
a 0
tweet 0
from 0
the 0
president. 0

His 1
voice 1
quivering, 1
Tillerson 0
thanked 0
career 0
diplomats 0
for 0
their 0
“honesty 0
and 0
integrity” 0
and 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
for 0
“acts 0
of 0
kindness,” 0
and 0
he 0
singled 0
out 0
Defense 0
Secretary 0
Jim 0
Mattis 0
for 0
their 0
partnership 0
and 0
mutual 0
support 0
of 0
diplomacy. 0

But 0
he 0
notably 0
did 0
not 0
thank 0
Trump 0
or 0
praise 0
his 0
policies. 0

Tillerson 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
remain 0
in 0
his 0
post 0
until 0
March 0
31 0
but 0
is 0
delegating 0
all 0
authorities 0
for 0
running 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
to 0
Deputy 0
Secretary 0
John 0
Sullivan 0
and 0
is 0
committed 0
to 0
ensuring 0
“an 0
orderly 0
and 0
smooth 0
transition.” 0
The 1
deposed 1
diplomat 1
also 0
made 0
a 0
clear 0
statement 0
about 0
Russian 0
aggression: 0
“Much 0
work 0
remains 0
to 0
respond 1
to 1
the 1
troubling 1
behavior 1
and 1
actions 1
on 1
the 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
Russian 1
government.” 1

CNBC 0
reports 0
that 0
Tillerson 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
firing 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
on 0
Tuesday: 0

On 0
Tuesday 0
morning, 0
State 0
Department 0
spokesman 0
Steve 0
Goldstein 0
said 0
Tillerson 0
had 0
no 0
plans 0
to 0
leave. 0

He 0
“did 0
not 0
speak 0
to 0
the 0
president 0
this 0
morning 0
and 0
is 0
unaware 0
of 0
the 0
reason” 0
for 0
his 0
firing, 0
the 0
spokesman 0
added. 0

Two 0
White 0
House 0
officials 0
told 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
that 0
Tillerson 0
found 0
out 0
he 0
was 0
fired 0
Friday. 0

The 0
secretary 0
got 0
a 0
call 0
from 0
White 0
House 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
John 0
Kelly 0
but 0
only 0
got 0

an 0

presidential 0

concerning 0
him 0
may 0
be 0
coming, 0
officials 0
at 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
told 0
the 0
wire 0
service. 0

Later, 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
fired 0
Goldstein, 0
who 0
contradicted 0
the 0
administration’s 0
account 0
of 0
Tillerson’s 0
ouster, 0
according 0
to 0
NBC 0
News 0
and 0
the 0
AP. 0

Goldstein 0
was 0
the 0
under 0
secretary 0
of 0
state 0
for 0
public 0
diplomacy 0
and 0
public 0
affairs. 0

Trump 0
later 0
told 0
reporters 0
he 0
disagreed 0
with 0
Tillerson 0
on 0
some 0
issues 0
and 0
feels 0
the 0
diplomat 0
“will 1
be 1
much 1
happier 1
now.” 1

While 0
many 0
are 0
happy 0
that 0
Tillerson 0
is 0
gone, 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
are 0
concerned 0
with 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
being 0
installed 0
at 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
especially 0
regarding 0
his 1
un-American 1
comments 1
against 0
NSA 1
whistleblower 1
Edward 0
Snowden, 0
who 0
exposed 0
the 0
criminal 0
activity 0
of 0
the 0
Deep 0
State 0
in 0
DC. 0

Speaking 0
of 0
Snowden, 0
he 0
decided 0
to 0
chime 0
in 0
on 0
the 0
newly 0
appointed 0
CIA 0
director, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
say 0
anything 0
about 0
Pompeo 0
becoming 0
Secretary 0

“The 0

the 0
above 0
piece 0
at 0
The 0

wrote, 0
“Haspel, 0
who 0
will 0

the 0

to 0
lead 0
CIA, 0
didn’t 0
just 0
oversee 0
the 0
Bush 0
CIA’s 0
black 0
site 0
but 0
directly 0
participated 0
in 0
the 0
horrific 1
torture 1
of 1
detainees. 1

She 0
also 0
participated 0
in 0
the 0
particularly 1
gruesome 1
torture 1
of 0
detainee 0
Abu 0
Zubaydah.” 0

“This 1
isn’t 1
a 1
radical 1
departure 1
for 1
CIA,” 1
Greenwald 1
added. 1

“After 1
all, 1
Haspel 1
did 1
this 1
under 1
George 1
Tenet. 1

At 1
the 1
time, 1
John 1
Brennan 1
– 1
who 1
became 1
Obama’s 1
CIA 1
director 1
– 1
was 1
an 1
advocate 1
of 1

other 1
torture 1
methods. 1

And 1
Pompeo 1
was 1
fine 1

Still 1
notable: 1
she’s 1
