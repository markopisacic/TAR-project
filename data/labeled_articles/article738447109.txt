more 0 33 22

three 0 33 22

after 0 33 22
his 0 33 22

His 1 33 23
voice 1 33 23
quivering, 1 33 23
Tillerson 0 33 23
thanked 0 33 23
career 0 33 23

for 0 33 23
their 0 33 23
“honesty 0 33 23

integrity” 0 33 23
and 0 33 23
the 0 33 23
American 0 33 23
people 0 33 23
for 0 33 23
“acts 0 33 23
of 0 33 23
kindness,” 0 33 23

out 0 33 23

But 0 33 24

“Haspel, 0 33 56

CIA’s 0 33 56
black 0 33 56

directly 0 33 56
participated 0 33 56

the 0 33 56
horrific 1 33 56
torture 1 33 56
of 1 33 56
detainees. 1 33 56

She 0 33 57
also 0 33 57
participated 0 33 57
in 0 33 57
the 0 33 57
particularly 1 33 57

Greenwald 1 33 58
added. 1 33 58

“After 1 33 59
all, 1 33 59
Haspel 1 33 59
did 1 33 59
this 1 33 59
under 1 33 59
George 1 33 59

At 1 33 60
the 1 33 60
time, 1 33 60
John 1 33 60
Brennan 1 33 60
– 1 33 60
who 1 33 60
became 1 33 60
Obama’s 1 33 60
CIA 1 33 60
director 1 33 60
– 1 33 60
was 1 33 60
an 1 33 60
advocate 1 33 60
of 1 33 60
rendition 1 33 60
& 1 33 60
other 1 33 60
torture 1 33 60
methods. 1 33 60

And 1 33 61
Pompeo 1 33 61
was 1 33 61
fine 1 33 61
with 1 33 61
black 1 33 61
sites. 1 33 61

Still 1 33 62
notable: 1 33 62
she’s 1 33 62
