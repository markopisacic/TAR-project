in 0
Europe 0

standing 0
against 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
and 0
the 1

Viktor 0
Orban, 0
who 0
openly 0
professes 0
the 0
Reformed 0
faith 0
of 0
Christianity, 0
told 0
an 0
audience 0
at 0
the 0
Royal 0
Castle 0
in 0
Budapest, 0
“Christianity 1
is 1
Europe’s 1
last 1

He 0
continued 0
by 0
stating 0
that 0
mass 0
immigration, 0
especially 0
from 0
Africa, 0
“our 1
worst 1
nightmares 1
can 1
come 1
true. 1

The 1
West 1
falls 1
as 1
it 1
fails 1

Hungarian 0
leader 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
called 0
on 0
Sunday 0
for 0
a 0
global 0
alliance 0
against 0
migration 0
as 0
his 0
right-wing 0
populist 0
Fidesz 0
party 0
began 0
campaigning 0
for 0
an 0
April 0
8 0
election 0
in 0
which 0
it 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
win 0
a 0
third 0
consecutive 0
landslide 0
victory. 0

Popular 0
at 0
home 0
but 0
increasingly 0
at 0
odds 0
politically 0
and 0
economically 0
with 0
mainstream 0
European 0
Union 0
peers, 0
Orban 0
has 0
thrived 0
on 0
external 0
controversy, 0
including 0
repeated 0
clashes 0
with 0
Brussels 0
and 0
lately 0
the 0
United 0
Nations. 0

Those 0
conflicts, 0
mostly 0
centered 0
on 0
migration 0
since 0
people 0
fleeing 0
war 0
and 0
poverty 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
and 0
Africa 0
flooded 0
into 0
Europe 0
in 0
2015, 0
have 0
intensified 0
as 0
the 0
elections 0
approach 0
and 0
Orban 0
poses 0
as 1
a 1
savior 1
of 1
Europe’s 1
Christian 1
nations. 1

One 0
thing 0
to 0
note 0
is 0
that 0
Christianity 1
is 1
not 1
Europe's 1
"last 1
hope," 1
it's 1
the 1
world's 1
"only 1
hope." 1

In 0
speaking 0
of 0
the 0
influx 0
of 0
Muslim 0
migrants 0
into 0
Europe, 0
Orban 0
sees 0
it 0
as 0
destroying 0
the 0
culture 0
of 0
Europe 0
and 0
referred 0
to 0
it 0
as 0
an 0
“immigrant 0
zone, 0
a 0
mixed 0
population 0
world 0
that 0
heads 0
in 0
a 0
direction 1
different 1
from 1
ours.” 1

Orban 0
then 0
called 0
out 0
the 1
traitors 1
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
Europe 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
push 0
Hungary 0
to 0
accept 0
Muslim 1
invaders. 1

“Absurd 0
as 0
it 0
may 0
sound 0
the 0
danger 0
we 0
face 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
West, 0
from 0
politicians 0
in 0
Brussels, 0
Berlin 0
and 0
Paris,” 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
to 0
applause. 0

“Of 0
course 0
we 0
will 0
fight, 0
and 0
use 0
ever 0
stronger 0
legal 0
tools. 0

The 0
first 0
is 0
our 0
‘Stop 1
Soros’ 1
law.” 0

Orban 0
has 0
seen 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
George 0
Soros 0
and 0
his 0
organizations 0
in 0
Hungary 0
and 0
has 0
openly 0
criticized 0
it 0
and 0
Soros, 0
calling 0
Soros 0
a 0
"public 1
enemy." 1

He 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
Soros 0
has 0
"ruined" 1
millions 0
of 0
lives 0
via 0
his 0
"mafia 1
network." 1

Reuters 0
adds: 0

Soros, 0
for 0
his 0
part, 0
compared 1
Orban 1
unfavorably 1
to 1
both 1
the 1
Nazis 1
and 1
the 1
Communists, 1
saying 0
his 0
rule 0
evoked 0
dark 0
tones 0
from 0
the 0
1930’s 0
— 0
when 0
Hungary 0
was 0
allied 0
with 0
Nazi 0
Germany 0
— 0
and 0
was 0
more 0
oppressive 0
than 0
Cold 0
War 0
Soviet 0
occupation. 0

Orban 0
has 0
tightened 0
the 0
screws 0
on 0
non-government 0
organizations, 0
particularly 0
ones 0
funded 0
by 0
Soros, 0
and 0
attempted 0
to 0
close 0
a 0
prominent 0
Soros-founded 0
university. 0

Attributing 0
to 0
Soros 0
a 0
recent 0
United 0
Nations 0
plan 0
on 0
creating 0
a 0
global 0
blueprint 0
to 0
handle 0
the 0
migration 0
crisis, 0
Orban 0
said 0
he 0
anticipated 0
that 0
powerful 0
allies 0
would 0
help 0
him 0
prevent 0
the 0
U.N. 0
from 0
greasing 0
the 0
wheels 0
of 0
migration. 0

“Soros 0
has 0
antagonized 0
not 0
only 0
us 0
but 0
also 0
England, 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
Israel 0
too,” 0
Orban 0
said. 0

“Everywhere 0
he 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
migration 0
accepted. 0

It 0
won’t 0
work. 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
alone 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
fight 0
together 0
… 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
succeed.” 0

“We 0
don’t 0
think 0
the 0
fight 0
is 0
hopeless, 0
on 0
the 0
contrary, 0
we 0
are 0
winning,” 0
Orban 0
said. 0

“The 0
V4 0
is 0
firm, 0
Croatia 0
has 0
come 0
around, 0
Austria 0
has 0
turned 0
in 0
the 0
patriotic 0
direction, 0
and 0
in 0
Bavaria 0
the 0
CSU 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
resistance.” 0

The 1
fight 1
isn't 1
hopeless 1
for 1
those 1
whose 1
hope 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
Lord 1
and 1
will 1
stay 1
the 1
course. 1

I 0
wish 0
Orban 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
support 0
him 0
success! 0
