Yesterday, 0
the 0
alternative 0

was 0
boldly 1
advanced 0
in 0
a 0
coordinated 0
effort 0
to 0
silence 0
people 0
who 0
dissent 0
from 0
establishment 0
views. 0

It’s 0
just 0
one 0
more 0
step 0
toward 0
a 0
monopoly 0

those 1

have 0
unquestioned 0
access 0

more 0
than 0
2 0

And 0
this 1

terrify 1
everyone 1
who 1
wants 1

But 0
of 0
course, 0
since 0
they 0
too 0
push 0
political 0
messages 0
for 0
profit 0
(waaah, 0
Trump!) 0

as 0
do 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
corporate 0
media 0
outlets 0
out 0
there, 0
they 0
changed 0
their 0
headline 0
to 0
“Facebook 0
purged 0
over 0
800 0
U.S. 0
accounts 0
and 0
pages 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
accounts 0
were 0
also 0
suspended 0
by 0
Twitter 0
shortly 0
thereafter 0
should 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
this 1
is 1
a 1
coordinated 1
effort 1
to 1
silence 1
large 1
swaths 1
of 1
the 1
population. 1

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
best 0
coverage 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
from…Russia. 0

Sputnik 0
News 0
contacted 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
alternative 0
journalists 0
who 0
were 0
purged 0
to 0
get 0
their 0
take 0
on 0
what 0
happened. 0

You 0
may 0
recall 0
that 0
basically 0
every 0
blogger 0
outside 0
the 0
establishment 0
media 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
being 0
secretly 0
Russian 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
by 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
so 0
perhaps 0
actual 0
Russians 0
have 0
a 0
vested 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
truth 0
coming 0
out 0
on 0
this 0
topic. 0

My 0
friend 0
John 0
Vibes 0
is 0
an 1
amazing 1
person 1
who 0
contributes 0
to 0
The 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project. 0

He 0
said: 0

This 0
signifies 0
a 0
re-consolidation 0
of 0
the 0
media. 0

Cable 0
news 0
media 0
controlled 0
the 0
narrative 0
for 0
most 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
but 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
lowered 0
that 0
barrier 0
to 0
entry 0
and 0
allowed 0
the 0
average 0
person 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
media 0
themselves. 0

This 0
obviously 0
took 0
market 0
share 0
and 0
influence 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
traditional 0
media, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
allowed 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
diverse 0
public 0
conversation. 0

Now 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
platforms 0
that 0
have 0
monopolized 0
the 0
industry 0
are 0
favoring 0
mainstream 0
sources 0
and 0
silencing 0
alternative 0
voices. 0

So 0
now, 0
instead 0
of 0
allowing 0
more 0
people 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
voice, 0
these 0
platforms 0
are 0
creating 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
where 0
only 0
powerful 0
media 0
organizations 0
are 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
had 0
on 0
cable 0
news. 0

People 0
think 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
just 0
providing 0
an 0
activist 0
spin 0
on 0
the 0
news, 0
but 0
they 0
don’t 0
see 0
the 0
families 0
struggling 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
voice 0
heard. 0

For 0
example, 0
when 0
someone 0
is 0
shot 0
by 0
police, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
sources 0
often 0
just 0
republish 0
the 0
press 0
release 0
from 0
the 0
police 0
department, 0
without 0
presenting 0
the 0
victim’s 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story. 0

We 0
give 0
the 0
victims 0
and 0
their 0
families 0
a 0
voice, 0
which 0
is 0
essential 0
to 0
keep 0
power 0
in 0
check. 0

This 0
also 0
goes 0
for 0
bigger 0
issues 0
like 0
foreign 0
policy 0
as 0
well; 0
multiple 0
full-scale 0
invasions 0
of 0
Syria 0
have 0
been 0
prevented 0
because 0
of 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
alternative 0
media 0
made 0
viral. 0

to 0
cover 0

All 0

our 0

fact-checked 0

I 0
got 0
into 0
this 0
line 0
of 0
work 0
because 0
I 0
felt 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
need 0
for 0
media 0
that 0
challenged 0
mainstream 0
assumptions 0
and 0
biases 0
in 0
politics. 0

I 0
wanted 0
to 0
shed 0
light 0
on 0
corruption 0
and 0
wrongdoing 0
against 0
oppressed 0
peoples 0
and 0
cover 0
the 0
harsh 1
truth 1
about 0
American 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Over 0
the 0
last 0
28 0
days, 0
we 0
reached 0
7,088,000 0
people 0
on 0
Facebook. 0

The 0
timing 0
of 0
this 0
purge 0
is 0
rather 0
dubious 1
in 0
my 0
view, 0
coming 0
shortly 0
before 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections. 0

This 1
could 1
be 1
an 1
attempt 1
by 1
Facebook 1
itself 1
to 1
affect 1
the 1
outcome 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
elections. 1

The 0
Twitter 0
suspension 0
caught 0
me 0
by 0
surprise. 0

I 0
can 0
only 0
speculate 0
that 0
these 0
suspensions 0
were 0
a 1
coordinated 1
effort 1
to 1
stifle 1
our 1
message 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
elections. 1

(source) 0

Remember, 0
this 0
is 0
coordinated, 1
across 0
multiple 0
platforms. 0

Remember 0
when 0
this 0
happened 0
to 0
Alex 0
Jones? 0

Back 0
in 0
September, 0
an 0
assault 1
was 0
led 0
by 0
YouTube, 0
Google, 0
and 0
Facebook 0
against 0
Alex 0
Jones 0
of 0
Infowars 0
fame. 0

All 0
of 0
his 0
accounts 0
were 0
shut 0
down 0
in 0
quick 0
succession, 0
followed 0
by 0
his 0
credit 0
card 0
processing 0
companies 0
and 0
his 0
newsletter 0
service 0
providers. 0

I 0
wrote 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
“Alex 0
Jones 0
is 0
just 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
this 0
purge. 0

It’s 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
much 0
worse.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
other 0
dissenting 0
voices 0
were 0
being 0
silenced 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
with 0
limited 0
reach 0
and 0
“shadow 0
banning.” 0

Infowars 0
is 0
a 0
massive 0
profit 0
machine. 0

But 0
what 0
happens 0
when 0
similar 0
attacks 0
are 0
launched 0
on 0
smaller 0
alternative 0
media 0
outlets? 0

It 0
hits 0
us 0
right 0
in 0
the 0
wallet. 0

And 0
if 0
they’re 0
hit 0
hard 0
enough, 0
they’ll 0
cease 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
function. 0

Jones 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
money 0
so 0
this 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
him, 0
but 0
for 0
most 0
website 0
owners, 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
absolute 0
end 0
of 0
our 0
ability 0
to 0
do 0
business. 0

And 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
bring 0
the 0
information 0
we 0
bring, 0
we 0
do 0
have 0
to 0
run 0
our 0
websites 0
as 0
businesses. 0

It’s 0
far 0
more 0
expensive 0
than 0
most 0
people 0
realize 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
site. 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
my 0
own 0
operating 0
costs 0
every 0
month 0
are 0
more 0
than 0
$2000. 0

A 0
site 0
as 0
big 0
as 0
Jones’s 0
would 0
be 0
many 0
times 0
that 0
amount. 0

When 0
all 0
your 0
avenues 0
of 0
monetization 0
are 0
cut 0
off, 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
hard 0
for 0
a 0
site 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
dissent 0
and 0
information 0
they 0
share 0
– 0
to 0
cease 0
to 0
exist. 0

is 0

to 0
not 0

senator 0
and 0
the 0
libertarian 0
voice 0
of 0
reason, 0
said 0
when 0
Jones 0
was 0
purged: 0

“You 0
get 0
accused 0
of 0
treasonous 0
activity 0
and 0
treasonous 0
speech 0
because 0
in 0
an 0
empire 1
of 1
lies 1
the 0
truth 0
is 0
treason,” 0
Paul 0
told 0
the 0
Russia-based 0
news 0
outlet. 0

“Challenging 0
the 0
status 0
quo 0
is 0
what 0
they 0
can’t 0
stand 0
and 0
it 0
unnerves 0
them, 0
so 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
silence 0
people.” 0
“Some 0
of 0
us 0
tell 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
our 1
government, 1
they 0
call 0
us 0
treasonous 0
and 0
say 0
we’re 0
speaking 0
out 0
of 0
line 0
and 0
they’d 0
like 0
to 0
punish 0
us, 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
that’s 0
part 0
of 0
what’s 0
happening 0
with 0
social 0
media,” 0
Paul 0
told 0
RT, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
hopes 0
anti-government 0
or 0
anti-war 0
voices 0
can 0
eliminate 0
their 0
“dependency” 0
on 0
the 0
current 0
social 0
media 0
platforms. 0

“I’m 0
just 0
hoping 0
that 0
technology 0
can 0
stay 0
ahead 0
of 0
it 0
all 0
and 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
have 0
real 0
alternatives 0
to 0
the 0
dependency 0
on 0
Twitter 0
and 0
other 0
companies 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
working 0
hand 0
in 0
glove 0
with 0
the 0
government,” 0
Paul 0
added. 0

Here’s 0
a 0
video 0
from 0
last 0
month 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Paul’s 0
thoughts 0
about 0
the 0
social 0
media 0
purge. 0

In 0
it, 0
he 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
Facebook 0
is 0
a 0
private 0
entity 0
so 0
they 0
do 0
have 0
every 0
right 0
to 0
remove 0
the 0
pages 0
they 0
wish. 0

The 0
danger 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
area 0
in 0
which 0
this 0
treads 0
on 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
– 0
is 0
their 0
direct 0
ties 0
to 0
the 0
government. 0

This 0
affects 0
everyone. 0

If 0
you’re 0
reading 0
this 0
and 0
you 0
shrug 0
because 0
you, 0
personally, 0
don’t 0
have 0
a 0
Twitter 0
or 0
Facebook 0
account, 0
you’re 0
missing 0
the 0
bigger 0
point. 0

Consider 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
“population” 0
of 0
Facebook 0
is 0
bigger 0
than 0
the 0
populations 0
of 0
the 0
US, 0
China, 0
and 0
Brazil 0
combined. 0

That’s 0
how 0
many 0
people 0
will 0
now 0
only 0
receive 0
one 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
on 0
things 0
like 0
war, 0
politics, 0
guns, 0
and 0
current 0
events. 0

People 0
will 0
believe 0
what 0
they’re 0
told 0
because 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
alternative 0
information 0
presented. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
questions 0
asked. 0

It’s 0
literally 0
the 0
textbook 0
definition 0
of 0
brainwashing. 1

Definition 0
of 0
brainwashing 1

1: 0
a 0
forcible 1
indoctrination 0
to 0
induce 0
someone 0
to 0
give 0
up 0
basic 0
political, 0
social, 0
or 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
and 0
attitudes 0
and 0
to 0
accept 0
contrasting 0
regimented 0
ideas 0
2: 0
persuasion 0
by 0
propaganda 0
or 0
salesmanship 0

(Here’s 0
an 0
article 0
from 0
Psychology 0
Today 0
that 0
discusses 0
how 0
Facebook 0
is, 0
in 0
fact, 0
brainwashing 0
people 0
for 0
profit.) 0

Social 0
media 0
is 0
a 0
massive 0
source 0
of 0
information 0
and 0
influence 0
today. 0

If 0
the 0
information 0
is 0
rigged 0
by 0
entities 0
that 0
support 0
socialism, 0
gun 0
control, 0
and 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
privacy, 0
we’re 1
doomed. 1

2.2 0
billion 0
active 0
users 0
will 0
be 0
bombarded 1
with 0
these 0
messages 0
without 0
any 0
real 0
option 0
for 0
the 0
other 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story. 0

So 0
regardless 0
of 0
whether 0
you, 0
personally, 0
participate, 0
this 0
will 0
color 0
popular 0
sentiment 0
to 0
a 0
massive 1
degree. 0

It 0
will 0
grow 0
the 0
cognitive 0
dissonance 0
that 0
assures 0
people 0
of 0
things 0
like 0
“the 1
government 1
is 1
your 1
friend” 1
and 0
that 0
“you 1
don’t 1
need 1
to 1
protect 1
yourself, 1
the 1
police 1
will 1
take 1
care 1
of 1
you.” 1

People 0
who 0
hate 0
freedom 0
will 0
get 0
unfettered 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
2 0
billion 0
people. 0

That 1
should 1
scare 1
the 1
crap 1
out 1
of 1
you. 1

What 0
can 0
you 0
do 0
about 0
the 0
alternative 0
media 0
purge? 0

It’s 0
possible 0
but 0
unlikely 0
that 0
social 0
pressure 0
on 0
Facebook 0
and 0
Twitter 0
will 0
push 0
the 0
outlets 0
into 0
restoring 0
the 0
accounts 0
of 0
these 0
alternative 0
media 0
networks. 0

But 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
restored, 0
I 0
suspect 0
their 0
reach 0
will 0
dwindle 0
even 0
further. 0

You’re 0
going 0
to 0

it. 0

We’re 1
watching 1
the 1
biggest 1
campaign 1

thought 1
that 1
has 1
ever 1
occurred 1
in 1
our 1
part 1
of 1
the 1

The 0
alternative 0

is 0
just 0
the 0
beginning. 0

And 0
we 1
should 1
all 1
be 1
very 1
concerned. 1
