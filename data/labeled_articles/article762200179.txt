Washington 0
(CNN) 0
Senate 0
Republicans 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
accused 0
the 0
Obama 0
Administration 0
of 0
secretly 0
trying 0
to 0
give 0
Tehran 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
financial 0
system 0
to 0
convert 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
assets 0
into 0
Euros 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

A 0
report 0
released 0
by 0
Republican 0
senators 0
on 0
the 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigation 0
said 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
didn't 0
tell 0
Congress 0
that 0
it 0
sought 0
access 0
for 0
Iran 0
and, 0
in 0
its 0
eagerness 0
to 0
clinch 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
dodge 0
sanctions 0
that 0
remained 0
in 0
place 0
following 0
the 0
2016 0
agreement. 0

"The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
misled 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
and 0
Congress 0
because 0
they 0
were 0
desperate 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran," 0
said 0
Sen. 0

Rob 0
Portman, 0
the 0
Ohio 0
Republican 0
who 0
chairs 0
the 0
subcommittee 0
and 0
opposed 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal, 0
formally 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
Joint 0
Comprehensive 0
Plan 0
of 0
Action. 0

The 0
accusations 0
were 0
rejected 0
by 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
who 0
said 0
Republicans 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
one-time 0
effort 0
to 0
meet 0
obligations 0
under 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
sound 0
like 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
broad 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
financial 0
system. 0

They 0
said 0
the 0
Republican 0
senators 0
never 0
interviewed 0
former 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
involved, 0
and 0
noted 0
that 0
no 0
Democrats 0
were 0
involved. 0

The 0
story 0
"is 0
widely 1
overblown," 0
said 0
Jarrett 0
Blanc, 0
the 0
former 0
State 0
Department 0
coordinator 0
for 0
Iran 0
deal 0
implementation 0
at 0
the 0
State 0
Department. 0

Iran 0
deal 0
reverberations 0

The 0
report 0
and 0
the 0
former 0
officials' 0
response 0
highlight 0
how 0
controversial 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal 0
continues 0
to 0
be, 0
even 0
after 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump's 0
May 0
8 0
decision 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
international 0
pact. 0

That 0
move 0
continues 0
to 0
roil 0
relations 0
with 0
European 0
allies 0
who 0
are 0
sticking 0
with 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal. 0

They 0
appealed 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
to 0
exempt 0
them 0
from 0
sanctions 0
as 0
they 0
continue 0
to 0
do 0
business 0
with 0
Tehran. 0

But 0
one 0
goal 0
behind 0
report's 0
release, 0
according 0
to 0
an 0
official 0
familiar 0
with 0
its 0
contents, 0
is 0
to 0
make 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
is 0
not 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
exemptions 0
of 0
any 0
kind. 0

"As 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
begins 0
to 0
re-impose 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
and 0
Iranian 0
entities, 0
our 0
European 0
allies 0
must 0
understand 0
and 0
appreciate 0
that 0
doing 0
business 0
with 0
Iran 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
permissible," 0
the 0
source 0
said. 0

The 0
report 0
focuses 0
on 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
from 0
Iranian 0
oil 0
sales 0
that 0
were 0
frozen 0
in 0
Oman's 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
in 0
that 0
country's 0
currency, 0
the 0
rial. 0

Rials 0
are 0
pegged 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
dollar 0
and 0
are 0
difficult 0
to 0
convert. 0

But 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
Iran 0
was 0
promised 0
access 0
to 0
overseas 0
reserves 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
funds 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
frozen 0
by 0
sanctions. 0

To 0
access 0
the 0
rials, 0
Iran 0
wanted 0
to 0
convert 0
them 0
briefly 0
into 0
dollars 0
and 0
then 0
Euros. 0

The 0
majority 0
report 0
by 0
the 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigation 0
says 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
Treasury, 0
at 0
the 0
instruction 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
State 0
Department, 0
granted 0
a 0
license 0
to 0
convert 0
the 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
briefly 0
into 0
American 0
dollars 0
so 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
converted 0
into 0
euros. 0

The 0
exchange 0
was 0
legal, 0
the 0
report 0
notes. 0

Officials 0
at 0
Treasury's 0
Office 0
of 0
Foreign 0
Assets 0
Control 0
asked 0
two 0
US 0
banks 0
to 0
work 0
as 0
intermediaries 0
and 0
execute 0
the 0
transaction, 0
but 0
they 0
declined, 0
citing 0
concern 0
over 0
potential 0
regulatory 0
backlash 0
and 0
a 0
ding 0
to 0
their 0
reputations. 0

Emails 0
reviewed 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
show 0
that 0
OFAC 0
officials 0
worked 0
to 0
encourage 0
banks 0
to 0
take 0
part 0
in 0
the 0
deal 0
by 0
proposing 0
to 0
bring 0
in 0
senior 0
officials. 0

"I 0
agree 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
idea 0
to 0
have 0
(Treasury 0
Secretary 0
Jack) 0
Lew 0
engage 0
(the 0
US 0

If 0
they 0
refuse 0
we 0

(Secretary 0

an 0
email 0
from 0
a 0
US 0

said. 0

After 0

officials 0
were 0
examining 0
whether 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal's 0
relevant 0
sanctions 0
permit 0
currency 0

the 0

says 0
a 0
Treasury 0
official 0
wrote 0
in 0
an 0
email, 0
"Yikes. 1

It 0
looks 0

beyond 0
just 0
allowing 0

A 0
legal 0
transaction 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
Treasury 0
officials 0
concluded 0
that 0
the 0
transaction 0
was 0
legal. 0

The 0
report 0
said 0
they 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
were 0
"consistent 0
with 0
Iran's 0
position, 0
allowing 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
Iran 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
'transfers,' 0
'foreign 0

the 0
'purchase 0

of 0

The 0
source 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
report 0
said 0
that 0
Congress 0
asked 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
directly 0
about 0
such 0
a 0
license, 0
but 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
was 0
under 0
no 0
legal 0
obligation 0
to 0
provide 0
the 0
licenses 0
to 0
Congress. 0

The 0
Republican 0
report 0
argues 0
that 0
in 0
pushing 0
for 0
the 0
license 0
to 0
go 0
forward, 0
Obama 0
officials 0
were 0
violating 0
financial 0
and 0
oil-related 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
Iran 0
stemming 0
from 0
the 0
seizure 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Embassy 0
in 0
Tehran 0

1979 0
and 0
trying 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
access 0
to 0
the 0

system. 0

They 0
pointed 0
to 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Obama 0
officials, 0
including 0
Lew, 0
who 0
said 0
in 0
congressional 0
testimony 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
not 0
granted 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
financial 0

Lew 0
said 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
Iran 0
"will 0
