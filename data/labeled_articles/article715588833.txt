“About 0 19 1

because 0 19 1

Royal, 0 19 6
“has 0 19 6
little 0 19 6

the 0 19 7

of 0 19 7
the 0 19 7
Church 0 19 7
himself 0 19 7

what 0 19 7
then?” 0 19 7
What 0 19 7
then 0 19 7
indeed? 0 19 7

The 1 19 8
Dictator 1 19 8
Pope 1 19 8
even 0 19 8
feels 0 19 8
at 0 19 8
liberty 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
demand 0 19 8
that 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
Lord’s 0 19 8
Prayer 0 19 8
be 0 19 8
changed 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
reflect 0 19 8
his 0 19 8
dissatisfaction 0 19 8
with 0 19 8
God’s 0 19 8
words: 0 19 8
“And 0 19 8
lead 0 19 8
us 0 19 8
not 0 19 8
into 0 19 8
temptation 0 19 8
[et 0 19 8
ne 0 19 8
nos 0 19 8
inducas 0 19 8
in 0 19 8
tentationem],” 0 19 8
which 0 19 8
Francis 0 19 8
has 0 19 8
decided, 0 19 8
after 0 19 8
2,000 0 19 8
years, 0 19 8
is 0 19 8
a 0 19 8
“not 0 19 8
a 0 19 8
good 0 19 8
translation.” 0 19 8
Apparently 0 19 8
lost 0 19 8
on 0 19 8
Francis, 0 19 8
given 1 19 8
the 1 19 8
disordered 1 19 8
mélange 1 19 8
of 1 19 8
bits 1 19 8
and 1 19 8
pieces 1 19 8
of 1 19 8
things 1 19 8
he 1 19 8
has 1 19 8
read 1 19 8
that 1 19 8
constitutes 1 19 8
his 1 19 8
theology, 1 19 8
is 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
distinction 0 19 8
between 0 19 8
sin, 0 19 8
a 0 19 8
culpable 0 19 8
act, 0 19 8
and 0 19 8
temptation, 0 19 8
which 0 19 8
arises 0 19 8
from 0 19 8
concupiscence 0 19 8
or 0 19 8
what 0 19 8
Saint 0 19 8
Thomas 0 19 8
called 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
fomes, 0 19 8
or 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
fleshly 0 19 8
inclination 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
sin, 0 19 8
which 0 19 8
grace 0 19 8
enables 0 19 8
us 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
control 0 19 8
by 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
rule 0 19 8
of 0 19 8
reason 0 19 8
over 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
passions. 0 19 8

But 0 19 9
now 0 19 9
we 0 19 9
are 0 19 9
witness 0 19 9
to 0 19 9
the 0 19 9
single 1 19 9
worst 1 19 9
act 1 19 9
of 1 19 9
tyranny 1 19 9
in 0 19 9
the 0 19 9
entire 0 19 9
history 0 19 9
of 0 19 9
the 0 19 9
papacy. 0 19 9

The 0 19 10
Church 0 19 10
has 0 19 10
seen 0 19 10
a 0 19 10
number 0 19 10
of 0 19 10
Popes 0 19 10
who 0 19 10
have 0 19 10
abused 0 19 10
their 0 19 10
power, 0 19 10
Alexander 0 19 10
VI 0 19 10
being 0 19 10
the 0 19 10
most 0 19 10
popularly 0 19 10
known 0 19 10
example. 0 19 10

But 1 19 11
never, 1 19 11
before 1 19 11
Francis, 1 19 11
has 1 19 11
there 1 19 11
been 1 19 11
a 1 19 11
Pope 1 19 11
who 1 19 11
dared 1 19 11
to 1 19 11
tyrannize 1 19 11
the 1 19 11
Magisterium 1 19 11
itself 1 19 11
by 1 19 11
attempting 1 19 11
to 1 19 11
bend 1 19 11
it 1 19 11
to 1 19 11
his 1 19 11
errant 1 19 11
personal 1 19 11
opinions. 1 19 11

Apostolicae 0 19 12

(AAS), 0 19 12
Francis 0 19 12
has 0 19 12
officially 0 19 12
declared 0 19 12
that 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
“authentic 0 19 12
Magisterium” 0 19 12
includes 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
guidelines 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
bishops 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
Buenos 0 19 12
Aires 0 19 12
for 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
implementation 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
Chapter 0 19 12
8 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
Amoris 0 19 12
Laetitia 0 19 12
(AL), 0 19 12
which 0 19 12
he 0 19 12
expressly 0 19 12
approved 0 19 12
in 0 19 12
his 0 19 12
letter 0 19 12
to 0 19 12
them 0 19 12
as 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
only 0 19 12
correct 0 19 12
interpretation 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
his 0 19 12
will. 0 19 12

The 0 19 13
guidelines 0 19 13
have 0 19 13
been 0 19 13
published 0 19 13
in 0 19 13
the 0 19 13
AAS 0 19 13
along 0 19 13
with 0 19 13
Francis’s 0 19 13
private 0 19 13
missive, 0 19 13
which 0 19 13
is 0 19 13
suddenly 0 19 13
declared 0 19 13
to 0 19 13
be 0 19 13
“an 0 19 13
apostolic 0 19 13
letter.” 0 19 13

The 0 19 14
normalist 0 19 14
narrative 0 19 14
has 0 19 14
just 0 19 14
been 0 19 14
stripped 0 19 14
of 0 19 14
any 0 19 14
colorable 0 19 14
argument 0 19 14
that 0 19 14
nothing 0 19 14
is 0 19 14
too 0 19 14
terribly 0 19 14
amiss 0 19 14
with 0 19 14
this 0 19 14
pontificate. 0 19 14

We 0 19 15
are 0 19 15
now 0 19 15
expected 0 19 15
to 0 19 15
believe 0 19 15
that 0 19 15
the 0 19 15
“authentic 0 19 15
Magisterium”—meaning 0 19 15
simply 0 19 15
and 0 19 15
only 0 19 15
AL—teaches 0 19 15
what 0 19 15
the 0 19 15
guidelines 0 19 15
preposterously 0 19 15
declare, 0 19 15
solely 0 19 15
in 0 19 15
reliance 0 19 15
on 0 19 15
AL: 0 19 15

When 0 19 16
the 0 19 16
concrete 0 19 16
circumstances 0 19 16
of 0 19 16
a 0 19 16
couple 0 19 16
make 0 19 16
it 0 19 16
feasible, 0 19 16
especially 0 19 16
when 0 19 16
both 0 19 16
are 0 19 16
Christians 0 19 16
with 0 19 16
a 0 19 16
journey 0 19 16
of 0 19 16
faith, 0 19 16
one 0 19 16
may 0 19 16
propose 0 19 16
that 0 19 16
they 0 19 16
commit 0 19 16
to 0 19 16
living 0 19 16
in 0 19 16
continence…. 0 19 16

In 0 19 17
other 0 19 17
more 0 19 17
complex 0 19 17
circumstances, 0 19 17
and 0 19 17
when 0 19 17
it 0 19 17
is 0 19 17
not 0 19 17
possible 0 19 17
to 0 19 17
obtain 0 19 17
a 0 19 17
declaration 0 19 17
of 0 19 17
nullity, 0 19 17
the 0 19 17
aforementioned 0 19 17
option 0 19 17
may 0 19 17
not, 0 19 17
in 0 19 17
fact, 0 19 17
be 0 19 17
viable. 0 19 17

Nonetheless, 0 19 18
it 0 19 18
is 0 19 18
equally 0 19 18
possible 0 19 18
to 0 19 18
undertake 0 19 18
a 0 19 18
journey 0 19 18
of 0 19 18
discernment…. 0 19 18

[I]f 0 19 19
one 0 19 19
arrives 0 19 19
at 0 19 19
the 0 19 19
recognition 0 19 19
that, 0 19 19
in 0 19 19
a 0 19 19
concrete 0 19 19
case, 0 19 19
there 0 19 19
are 0 19 19
limitations 0 19 19
that 0 19 19
diminish 0 19 19
responsibility 0 19 19
and 0 19 19
culpability 0 19 19
(cf. 0 19 19

301-302), 0 19 20
particularly 0 19 20
when 0 19 20
a 0 19 20
person 0 19 20
judges 0 19 20
that 0 19 20
he 0 19 20
would 0 19 20
fall 0 19 20
into 0 19 20
a 0 19 20
subsequent 0 19 20
fault 0 19 20
by 0 19 20
damaging 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
children 0 19 20
of 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
new 0 19 20
union, 0 19 20
Amoris 0 19 20
Laetitia 0 19 20
opens 0 19 20
up 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
possibility 0 19 20
of 0 19 20
access 0 19 20
to 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
Sacraments 0 19 20
of 0 19 20
Reconciliation 0 19 20
and 0 19 20
the 0 19 20

(cf. 0 19 20

notes 0 19 21

and 0 19 21

As 0 19 22
Francis 0 19 22
would 0 19 22
have 0 19 22
it, 0 19 22
then, 0 19 22
the 0 19 22
“authentic 0 19 22

has 0 19 22
just 0 19 22
flatly 0 19 22

itself 0 19 22

Francis, 0 19 32
however, 0 19 32
has 0 19 32
purported 0 19 32
to 0 19 32
do 0 19 32
nothing 0 19 32

that 0 19 32
oppose 0 19 32
the 0 19 32
doctrine 0 19 32
of 0 19 32
the 0 19 32
Church. 0 19 32

The 0 19 33
attempt 0 19 33
is 0 19 33
void, 0 19 33
of 0 19 33
course, 0 19 33
and 0 19 33
the 0 19 33
appellation 0 19 33
“authentic 0 19 33
Magisterium” 0 19 33
is 0 19 33
fraudulent. 0 19 33

But 0 19 34
the 0 19 34
consequences 0 19 34
of 0 19 34
this 0 19 34
Pope’s 0 19 34
toying 1 19 34
with 1 19 34
the 1 19 34
teaching 1 19 34
office 1 19 34
of 0 19 34
the 0 19 34
Church 0 19 34
to 0 19 34
advance 0 19 34
half-baked 1 19 34
theological 1 19 34
notions, 1 19 34
such 0 19 34
as 0 19 34
“discernment” 0 19 34
(a 0 19 34
term 0 19 34
he 0 19 34
borrows 0 19 34
from 0 19 34
St. 0 19 34
Ignatius 0 19 34
of 0 19 34
Loyola 0 19 34
but 0 19 34
strips 0 19 34
of 0 19 34
its 0 19 34
original 0 19 34
meaning) 0 19 34
are 0 19 34
catastrophic. 0 19 34

Over 0 19 35
the 0 19 35
past 0 19 35
year, 0 19 35
Cardinal 0 19 35
Burke 0 19 35
and 0 19 35
a 0 19 35
few 0 19 35
other 0 19 35
members 0 19 35
of 0 19 35
the 0 19 35
hierarchy 0 19 35
have 0 19 35
called 0 19 35
upon 0 19 35
Francis 0 19 35
to 0 19 35
“clarify” 0 19 35
his 0 19 35
intention 0 19 35
respecting 0 19 35
AL. 0 19 35

That 0 19 36
clarification 0 19 36
has 0 19 36
now 0 19 36
been 0 19 36
given: 0 19 36
Francis 0 19 36
intends, 0 19 36
if 0 19 36
it 0 19 36
were 0 19 36
possible, 0 19 36
to 0 19 36
change 0 19 36
the 0 19 36
unchangeable 0 19 36
teaching 0 19 36
of 0 19 36
the 0 19 36
Church 0 19 36
regarding 0 19 36
an 0 19 36
irrevocable 0 19 36
moral 0 19 36
norm 0 19 36
rooted 0 19 36
in 0 19 36
divine 0 19 36
law. 0 19 36

Even 1 19 37
if 1 19 37
the 1 19 37
attempt 1 19 37
is 1 19 37
void 1 19 37
and 1 19 37
of 1 19 37
no 1 19 37
effect 1 19 37
before 1 19 37
man 1 19 37
and 1 19 37
God—an 1 19 37
immoral 1 19 37
law 1 19 37
is 1 19 37
no 1 19 37
law 1 19 37
at 1 19 37
all—Francis 0 19 37
clearly 0 19 37
means 0 19 37
to 0 19 37
impose 0 19 37
his 0 19 37
will 0 19 37
by 0 19 37
fiat, 0 19 37
daring 0 19 37
invoke 0 19 37
the 0 19 37
“authentic 0 19 37
Magisterium” 0 19 37
to 0 19 37
cloak 1 19 37
his 1 19 37
absurd 1 19 37
novelties. 1 19 37

No 1 19 38
Pope 1 19 38
before 1 19 38
him 1 19 38
has 1 19 38
ever 1 19 38
dared 1 19 38
to 1 19 38
do 1 19 38
such 1 19 38
a 1 19 38
thing. 1 19 38

So 0 19 39
now 0 19 39
it 0 19 39
must 0 19 39
be 0 19 39
asked: 0 19 39
Where 0 19 39
are 0 19 39
the 0 19 39
cardinals 0 19 39
and 0 19 39
the 0 19 39
bishops? 0 19 39

With 0 19 40
one 0 19 40
or 0 19 40
two 0 19 40
noble 0 19 40
(however 0 19 40
inconsistent) 0 19 40
exceptions, 0 19 40
their 0 19 40
response 0 19 40
to 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
Bergoglian 0 19 40
Debacle 0 19 40
thus 0 19 40
far 0 19 40
ranges 0 19 40
from 0 19 40
silence, 0 19 40
to 0 19 40
active 0 19 40
complicity, 0 19 40
to—at 0 19 40
best—hand-wringing 0 19 40
over 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
increasingly 0 19 40
chaotic 0 19 40
state 0 19 40
of 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
Church 0 19 40
while 0 19 40
begging 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
Pope 0 19 40
to 0 19 40
“clarify” 0 19 40
his 0 19 40
already 0 19 40
perfectly 0 19 40
clear 0 19 40
intentions. 0 19 40

At 0 19 41
this 0 19 41
point, 0 19 41
continued 0 19 41
pleading 0 19 41
for 0 19 41
a 0 19 41
Bergoglian 0 19 41
“clarification” 0 19 41
can 0 19 41
only 0 19 41
give 0 19 41
rise 0 19 41
to 0 19 41
an 0 19 41
impression 0 19 41
of 0 19 41
disingenuousness, 0 19 41
whereas 0 19 41
continued 0 19 41
silence 0 19 41
about 0 19 41
the 0 19 41
papal 0 19 41
origin 0 19 41
of 0 19 41
this 0 19 41
ongoing 0 19 41
catastrophe 0 19 41
is 1 19 41
a 1 19 41
standing 1 19 41
rebuke 1 19 41
to 1 19 41
all 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
hierarchs 1 19 41
who 1 19 41
know 1 19 41
what 1 19 41
we 1 19 41
all 1 19 41
know: 1 19 41
that 1 19 41
at 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
epicenter 1 19 41
of 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
chaos 1 19 41
is 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
most 1 19 41
wayward 1 19 41
Pope 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
Church 1 19 41
has 1 19 41
ever 1 19 41
had 1 19 41
to 1 19 41
endure. 1 19 41

Continued 1 19 42
inaction 1 19 42
while 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
laity 1 19 42
and 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
few 1 19 42
good 1 19 42
priests 1 19 42
are 1 19 42
left 1 19 42
to 1 19 42
themselves 1 19 42
to 1 19 42
defend, 1 19 42
as 1 19 42
best 1 19 42
they 1 19 42
can, 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
constant 1 19 42
teaching 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
Church 1 19 42
against 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
abuses 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
tyrant 1 19 42
on 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
Chair 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
Peter 1 19 42
threatens 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
hierarchs 1 19 42
with 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
legacy 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
shame 1 19 42
and 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
terrible 1 19 42
accountability 1 19 42
before 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
Just 1 19 42
Judge. 1 19 42

Their 0 19 43
failure 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
defend 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
Faith 0 19 43
by 0 19 43

to 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
Church 0 19 43
and 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
cause 0 19 43
of 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
Gospel 0 19 43
of 0 19 43
which 0 19 43
they 0 19 43
are 0 19 43
divinely 0 19 43
charged 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
be 0 19 43
leaders. 0 19 43

The 1 19 44
time 1 19 44
for 1 19 44
“prudence” 1 19 44
is 1 19 44
long 1 19 44
past. 1 19 44

Prudence 0 19 45
now 0 19 45
gives 0 19 45
way 0 19 45
to 0 19 45
mere 0 19 45
pusillanimity. 0 19 45

The 0 19 46
time 0 19 46
for 0 19 46
hierarchical 0 19 46
action 0 19 46
is 0 19 46
now, 0 19 46
before 0 19 46
the 0 19 46
damage 0 19 46
to 0 19 46
the 0 19 46
Church 0 19 46
becomes 0 19 46
irreparable. 0 19 46

The 0 19 47
members 0 19 47
of 0 19 47
a 0 19 47
hierarchy 0 19 47
seemingly 0 19 47
cowed 0 19 47
by 0 19 47
a 1 19 47
papal 1 19 47
tyranny 1 19 47
the 1 19 47
Church 1 19 47
has 1 19 47
never 1 19 47
before 1 19 47
seen 1 19 47
must 0 19 47
rise 0 19 47
immediately 0 19 47
and 0 19 47
give 0 19 47
a 0 19 47
courageous 0 19 47
answer 0 19 47
to 0 19 47
the 0 19 47
challenge 0 19 47
posed 0 19 47
long 0 19 47
ago 0 19 47
by 0 19 47
Monsignor 0 19 47
Klaus 0 19 47
Gamber, 0 19 47
when 0 19 47
an 0 19 47
already 0 19 47
monumental 0 19 47
ecclesial 0 19 47
crisis 0 19 47
was 0 19 47
still 0 19 47
in 0 19 47
what 0 19 47
can 0 19 47
now 0 19 47
can 0 19 47
be 0 19 47
seen 0 19 47
as 0 19 47
merely 0 19 47
a 0 19 47
preliminary 0 19 47
stage: 0 19 47

Where 0 19 48
in 0 19 48
our 0 19 48
Church 0 19 48
are 0 19 48
the 0 19 48
leaders 0 19 48
who 0 19 48
can 0 19 48
show 0 19 48
us 0 19 48
the 0 19 48
right 0 19 48
path? 0 19 48

Where 0 19 49
are 0 19 49
the 0 19 49
bishops 0 19 49
courageous 0 19 49
enough 0 19 49
to 1 19 49
cut 1 19 49
out 1 19 49
the 1 19 49
cancerous 1 19 49
growth 1 19 49
of 1 19 49
modernist 1 19 49
theology 1 19 49
that 1 19 49
has 1 19 49
implanted 1 19 49
itself 1 19 49
and 1 19 49
is 1 19 49
festering 1 19 49
within 1 19 49
the 1 19 49
celebration 1 19 49
of 1 19 49
even 1 19 49
the 1 19 49
most 1 19 49
sacred 1 19 49
mysteries, 1 19 49
before 1 19 49
the 1 19 49
cancer 1 19 49
spreads 1 19 49
and 1 19 49
causes 1 19 49
even 1 19 49
greater 1 19 49
damage? 1 19 49

What 0 19 50
we 0 19 50
need 0 19 50
today 0 19 50
is 0 19 50
a 0 19 50
new 0 19 50
Athanasius, 0 19 50
a 0 19 50
new 0 19 50
Basil, 0 19 50
bishops 0 19 50
like 0 19 50
those 0 19 50
who 0 19 50
in 0 19 50
the 0 19 50
fourth 0 19 50
century 0 19 50
fought 0 19 50
courageously 0 19 50
against 0 19 50
Arianism 0 19 50
when 0 19 50
almost 0 19 50
the 0 19 50
whole 0 19 50
of 0 19 50
Christendom 0 19 50
had 0 19 50
succumbed 0 19 50
to 0 19 50
heresy. 0 19 50

Will 0 19 51
none 0 19 51
of 0 19 51
the 0 19 51
hierarchs 0 19 51
rise 0 19 51
to 0 19 51
defend 0 19 51
the 0 19 51
Church 0 19 51
as 0 19 51
“a 0 19 51
new 0 19 51
Athanasius, 0 19 51
a 0 19 51
new 0 19 51
Basil”? 0 19 51

Even 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
best 0 19 52
among 0 19 52
them 0 19 52
continue 0 19 52
to 0 19 52
limit 0 19 52
themselves 0 19 52
to 0 19 52
generalized 0 19 52
lamentations 0 19 52
at 0 19 52
conferences 0 19 52
or 0 19 52
in 0 19 52
interviews 0 19 52
about 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
parlous 0 19 52
state 0 19 52
of 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
Church 0 19 52
or 0 19 52
at 0 19 52
most 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
“confusion” 0 19 52
Francis 0 19 52
has 0 19 52
caused 0 19 52
by 0 19 52
not 0 19 52
“clarifying” 0 19 52
precisely 0 19 52
what 0 19 52
he 0 19 52
has 0 19 52
just 0 19 52
clarified. 0 19 52

They 0 19 53
avoid 0 19 53
the 0 19 53
absolutely 0 19 53
necessary 0 19 53
direct 0 19 53
and 0 19 53
public 0 19 53
exposure 0 19 53
of 0 19 53
error 0 19 53
at 0 19 53
its 0 19 53
source. 0 19 53

That 1 19 54
error 1 19 54
threatens 1 19 54
to 1 19 54
overwhelm 1 19 54
the 1 19 54
Church 1 19 54
while 1 19 54
they 1 19 54
do 1 19 54
little 1 19 54
more 1 19 54
than 1 19 54
fret 1 19 54
about 1 19 54
a 1 19 54
situation 1 19 54
whose 1 19 54
self-evident 1 19 54
cause—a 1 19 54
reckless 1 19 54
Pope 1 19 54
in 1 19 54
love 1 19 54
with 1 19 54
his 1 19 54
own 1 19 54
ideas 1 19 54
and 1 19 54
filled 1 19 54
with 1 19 54
contempt 1 19 54
for 1 19 54
Tradition—they 1 19 54
seem 1 19 54
incapable 1 19 54
of 1 19 54
identifying. 1 19 54

Concerned 0 19 55
clergy 0 19 55
and 0 19 55
laity 0 19 55
throughout 0 19 55
the 0 19 55
Catholic 0 19 55
world 0 19 55
are 0 19 55
doing 0 19 55
what 0 19 55
they 0 19 55
can 0 19 55
according 0 19 55
to 0 19 55
their 0 19 55
stations. 0 19 55

But 0 19 56
in 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
midst 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
that 0 19 56
“final 0 19 56
battle” 0 19 56
over 0 19 56
marriage 0 19 56
and 0 19 56
family 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
which 0 19 56
Sister 0 19 56
Lucia 0 19 56
warned 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
late 0 19 56
Cardinal 0 19 56
Caffarra 0 19 56
in 0 19 56
light 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
Third 0 19 56
Secret 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
Fatima, 0 19 56
within 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
human 0 19 56
element 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
Church 0 19 56
only 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
cardinals 0 19 56
and 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
bishops 0 19 56
possess 0 19 56
the 1 19 56
divinely 1 19 56
bestowed 1 19 56
power 1 19 56
to 1 19 56
repel 1 19 56
an 1 19 56
assault 1 19 56
on 1 19 56
marriage, 1 19 56
family 1 19 56
and 1 19 56
the 1 19 56
very 1 19 56
integrity 1 19 56
of 1 19 56
the 1 19 56
Faith 1 19 56
that 1 19 56
is 1 19 56
now, 1 19 56
for 1 19 56
the 1 19 56
first 1 19 56
time 1 19 56
in 1 19 56
Church 1 19 56
history, 1 19 56
being 0 19 56
led 0 19 56
by 0 19 56
a 0 19 56
Roman 0 19 56
Pontiff. 0 19 56

This 0 19 57
undeniably 0 19 57
apocalyptic 0 19 57
development 0 19 57
imposes 0 19 57
upon 0 19 57
the 0 19 57
hierarchs—first 0 19 57
and 0 19 57
foremost 0 19 57
in 0 19 57
the 0 19 57
Church—the 0 19 57
duty 0 19 57
to 0 19 57
act. 0 19 57

True 1 19 58
love 1 19 58
for 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
Church, 1 19 58
indeed 1 19 58
true 1 19 58
charity 1 19 58
toward 1 19 58
Francis 1 19 58
himself, 1 19 58
requires 1 19 58
of 1 19 58
them 1 19 58
nothing 1 19 58
less 1 19 58
than 1 19 58
what 1 19 58
was 1 19 58
required 1 19 58
of 1 19 58
Saint 1 19 58
Paul 1 19 58
when 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
first 1 19 58
Pope 1 19 58
fell 1 19 58
into 1 19 58
error 1 19 58
that 1 19 58
jeopardized 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
very 1 19 58
mission 1 19 58
of 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
Church: 1 19 58
that 1 19 58
Peter 1 19 58
be 1 19 58
withstood 1 19 58
to 1 19 58
his 1 19 58
face 1 19 58
(Gal. 1 19 58

2:11). 1 19 59

what 1 19 60
must 1 19 60
be 1 19 60
done 1 19 60
and 1 19 60
what 1 19 60
only 1 19 60
they 1 19 60

do. 1 19 60

Our 1 19 61

are 1 19 61
