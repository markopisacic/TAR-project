The 0
war 0
for 0
dominance 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East, 0
following 0
the 0
crushing 0
of 0
ISIS, 0
appears 0
about 0
to 0
commence 0
in 0
Syriaâ€”with 0
NATO 0
allies 0
America 0
and 0
Turkey 0
on 0
opposing 0
sides. 0

Turkey 0
is 0
moving 0
armor 0
and 0
troops 0
south 0
to 0
Syria's 0
border 0
enclave 0
of 0
Afrin, 0
occupied 0
by 0

to 0
drive 0
them 0
out, 0
and 0
then 0
drive 0

out 0

Says 0
President 0
Recep 0
Tayyip 0
Erdogan, 0
" 0
We 0
will 0
destroy 0
all 0
terror 1
nests, 1
one 0
by 0
one, 0
in 0
Syria, 0
starting 0
from 0
Afrin 0
and 0
Manbij." 0

For 0
Erdogan, 0
the 0
Kurdish 0
YPG, 0
the 0
major 0
U.S. 0
ally 0
in 0
Syria, 0
is 0
an 0
arm 0
of 0
the 0
Kurdish 0
PKK 0
in 0
Turkey, 0
which 0
we 0
and 0
the 0
Turks 0
have 0
designated 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization. 0

While 0
the 0
Kurds 0
were 0
our 0
most 0
effective 0
allies 0
against 0
ISIS 0
in 0
Syria, 0
Turkey 0
views 0
them 0
as 0
a 0
mortal 1
peril 1
and 0
intends 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
that 0
threat. 0

If 1
Erdogan 1
is 1
serious, 1
a 1
clash 1
with 1
the 1
U.S. 1
is 1
coming, 1
as 0
our 0
Kurdish 0
allies 0
occupy 0
most 0
of 0
Syria's 0
border 0
with 0
Turkey. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
U.S. 0
has 0
announced 0
plans 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
30,000-man 0
Border 0
Security 0
Force 0
of 0
Kurds 0
and 0
Arabs 0
to 0
keep 0
ISIS 0
out 0
of 0
Syria. 0

Erdogan 0
has 0
branded 0
this 0
BSF 0
a 0
"terror 1
army," 1
and 0
President 0
Bashar 0
Assad 0
of 0
Syria 0
has 0
called 0
BSF 0
members 0
"traitors." 1

This 0
U.S. 0
plan 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
BSF 0
inside 0
Syria, 0
Damascus 0
declared 0
, 0
"represents 0
a 0
blatant 1
attack 1
on 1
the 1
sovereignty 1
and 1
territorial 1
integrity 1
and 0
unity 0
of 0
Syria, 0

a 0
flagrant 1
violation 1
of 1

law." 1

Does 1
not 1
the 1
Syrian 1
government 1
have 1
a 1
point? 1

Now 0
that 0
ISIS 0
has 0
been 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
Raqqa 0
and 0
Syria, 0
by 1
what 1
authority 1
do 1
U.S. 1
forces 1
remain 1
to 1
arm 1
troops 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
Damascus 1
government 1
from 1
reimposing 1
its 1
authority 1
on 1
its 1
own 1
territory? 1

Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Tillerson 0
gave 0
Syria 0
the 0
news 0
Wednesday. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
troop 0
commitment 0
to 0
Syria, 0
he 0
said, 0
is 0
now 0
open-ended. 0

Our 0
goals: 0
Guarantee 0
al-Qaida 0
and 0
ISIS 0
do 0
not 0
return 0
and 0
set 0
up 0
sanctuary; 0
cope 0
with 0
rising 0
Iranian 0
influence 0
in 0
Damascus; 0
and 0
pursue 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0
Bashar 0
Assad's 0
ruthless 1
regime. 0

But 1
who 1
authorized 1
this 1
strategic 1
commitment, 1
of 0
indefinite 0
duration, 0
in 0
Syria, 0
when 0
near 0
two 0
decades 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
secure 0
that 0
nation 0
against 0
the 0
return 0
of 0
al-Qaida 0
and 0
ISIS? 0

Again 0
and 0
again, 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
have 0
said 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
dragged 0
into 0
Syria's 0
civil 0
war. 0

Donald 1
Trump 1
won 1
the 1
presidency 1
on 1
a 1
promise 1
of 1
no 1
more 1
unnecessary 1
wars. 1

Have 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
been 1
had 1
again? 1

Will 0
they 0
support 0
a 0
clash 0
with 0
NATO 0
ally 0
Turkey, 0
to 0
keep 0
armed 0
Kurds 0
on 0
Turkey's 0
border, 0
when 0
the 0
Turks 0
regard 0
them 0
as 0
terrorists? 0

Are 1
we 1
prepared 1
for 1
a 1
shooting 1
war 1
with 1
a 1
Syrian 1
army, 1
backed 1
by 1
Russia, 1
Iran, 1
Hezbollah 1
and 1
Shiite 1
militias 1
from 1
Iraq, 1
Afghanistan 1
and 1
Pakistan, 1
to 1
hold 1
onto 1
a 1
fourth 1
of 1
Syria's 1
territory 1
in 1
alliance 1
with 1
Kurds? 1

The 0
U.S. 0
coalition 0
in 0
Syria 0
said 0
this 0
week 0
the 0
BSF 0
will 0
be 0
built 0
up 0
"over 0
the 0
next 0
several 0
years" 0
and 0
"be 0

the 0
Euphrates 0

Remarkable: 0
A 0
U.S.-created 0
border 0
army 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
occupy 0
and 0
control 0
long 0
stretches 0
of 0
Syria's 0
borders 0
with 0
Turkey 0
and 0
Iraq, 0
over 0
Syria's 0
objections. 0

And 0
the 0
U.S. 0
military 0
will 0
stand 0
behind 0
the 0
BSF. 0

Are 1
the 1
2,000 1
U.S. 1
troops 1
in 1
Syria 1
really 1
up 1
to 1
that 1
task, 1
should 0
the 0
Turks 0
decide 0
to 0
cleanse 0
the 0
Syrian 0
border 0
of 0
Kurds, 0
or 0
should 0
the 0
Syrian 0
regime 0
decide 0
to 0
take 0
back 0
territory 0
occupied 0
by 0
the 0
Kurds? 0

Who 0
sanctioned 0
this 0
commitment 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
army, 0
which, 0
if 0
Syria 0
and 0
its 0
Russian 0
and 0
Iranian 0
allies, 0
and 0
the 0
Turks, 0
do 0
not 0
all 0
back 0
down, 0
risks 1
a 1
major 1
U.S. 1
war 1
with 1
no 1
allies 1
but 1
the 1
Kurds? 1

As 0
for 0
Syria's 0
Kurds 0
casting 0
their 0
lot 0
with 0
the 0
Americans, 0
one 0
wonders: 0
Did 0
they 0
not 0
observe 0
what 0
happened 0
when 0
their 0
Iraqi 0
cousins, 0
after 0
helping 0
us 0
drive 0
ISIS 0
out 0
of 0
Mosul, 0
were 0
themselves 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
Kirkuk 0
by 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
army, 0
as 0
their 0
U.S. 0
allies 0
watched? 0

In 0
the 0
six-year 0
Syrian 0
civil 0
war, 0
which 0
may 0
be 0
about 0
to 0
enter 0
a 0
new 0
phase, 0
America 0
faces 0
a 0
familiar 0
situation. 0

While 0
our 0
"allies" 0
and 0
adversaries 0
have 0
vital 0
interests 0
there, 0
we 0
do 0
not. 0

The 0
Assads 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
power 0
for 0
the 0
lifetime 0
of 0
most 0
Americans. 0

And 0
we 0
Americans 0
have 0
never 0
shown 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
fight 0
there. 0

Assad 0
has 0
a 0
vital 0
interest: 0
preservation 0
of 0
his 0
family 0
regime 0
and 0
the 0
reunification 0
of 0
his 0
country. 0

The 0
Turks 0
have 0
a 0
vital 0
interest 0
in 0
keeping 0
armed 0
Kurds 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
border 0
regions 0
adjacent 0
to 0
their 0
own 0
Kurdish 0
minority, 0
which 0
seeks 0
greater 0
independence. 0

The 0
Israelis 0
and 0
Saudi 0
royals 0
want 0
the 0
U.S. 0
to 0
keep 0
Iran 0
from 0
securing 0
a 0
land 0
bridge 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Damascus 0
to 0
Lebanon. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
War 0
Party 0
wants 0
us 0
to 0
smash 0
Iran 0
and 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
forever 0
to 0
assure 0
the 0
hegemony 0
of 0
its 0
favorites. 0

Have 1
the 1
generals 1
taking 1
us 1
into 1
Syria 1
told 1
the 1
president 1
how 1
and 1
when, 1
if 1
ever, 1
they 1
plan 1
to 1
get 1
us 1
out? 1
