went 0 27 16
on 0 27 16
to 0 27 16

that 0 27 16

under 0 27 16

civil 0 27 16

Officer 0 27 17
Guyger 0 27 17
was 0 27 17
terminated 0 27 17
for 0 27 17
her 0 27 17
actions. 0 27 17

She 0 27 18
was 0 27 18
hired 0 27 18
in 0 27 18
November 0 27 18
2013 0 27 18
and 0 27 18

to 0 27 18
the 0 27 18
Southeast 0 27 18
Patrol 0 27 18

the 0 27 19
right 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
appeal 0 27 19
her 0 27 19
discipline. 0 27 19

This 0 27 20
move 0 27 20
is 0 27 20
noteworthy 0 27 20
as 0 27 20
the 0 27 20
department 0 27 20
has 0 27 20
been 0 27 20
standing 0 27 20
up 0 27 20
against 0 27 20
those 0 27 20
who 0 27 20
have 0 27 20
been 0 27 20
calling 0 27 20

the 0 27 20
officer 0 27 20
to 0 27 20
be 0 27 20
fired. 0 27 20

As 0 27 21
recently 0 27 21
as 0 27 21
Friday, 0 27 21
Hall 0 27 21
refused 0 27 21
to 0 27 21
fire 0 27 21
Guyger, 0 27 21
saying 0 27 21
in 0 27 21
part, 0 27 21
“There 0 27 21
is 0 27 21
one 0 27 21
overriding 0 27 21
reason 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
I 0 27 21
have 0 27 21
not 0 27 21
taken 0 27 21
any 0 27 21
administrative 0 27 21
or 0 27 21
employment 0 27 21
action 0 27 21
against 0 27 21
Officer 0 27 21
Amber 0 27 21
Guyger. 0 27 21

I 0 27 22
don’t 0 27 22
want 0 27 22
to 0 27 22
interfere 0 27 22
with 0 27 22
the 0 27 22
on-going 0 27 22
criminal 0 27 22
investigation 0 27 22
into 0 27 22
her 0 27 22
actions.” 0 27 22

Also, 0 27 23
in 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
town 0 27 23
hall 0 27 23
meeting 0 27 23
last 0 27 23
week, 0 27 23
Hall 0 27 23
again 0 27 23
stood 0 27 23
behind 0 27 23
her 0 27 23
choice 0 27 23
to 0 27 23
refuse 0 27 23
to 0 27 23
fire 0 27 23
Guyger, 0 27 23
claiming 0 27 23
it 0 27 23
would 0 27 23
be 0 27 23
against 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
law. 0 27 23

“I 0 27 24
can’t 0 27 24
do 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
because 0 27 24
there 0 27 24
are 0 27 24
both 0 27 24
local, 0 27 24
state 0 27 24
and 0 27 24
federal 0 27 24
laws 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
prohibit 0 27 24
me 0 27 24
from 0 27 24
taking 0 27 24
action. 0 27 24

There 0 27 25
are 0 27 25
civil 0 27 25
service 0 27 25
laws 0 27 25
we 0 27 25
have 0 27 25
to 0 27 25
adhere 0 27 25
to,” 0 27 25
said 0 27 25
Hall. 0 27 25

Apparently, 0 27 26
it 0 27 26
is 0 27 26
no 0 27 26
longer 0 27 26
against 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
law. 0 27 26

This 0 27 27
news 0 27 27
will 0 27 27
likely 0 27 27
be 0 27 27
well 0 27 27
received 0 27 27
by 0 27 27
the 0 27 27
Jean 0 27 27
family 0 27 27
as 0 27 27
well 0 27 27
as 0 27 27
the 0 27 27
activists 0 27 27
who 0 27 27
have 0 27 27
been 0 27 27
calling 0 27 27
for 0 27 27
justice 0 27 27
for 0 27 27
Botham 0 27 27
since 0 27 27
the 0 27 27
beginning. 0 27 27

As 0 27 28
TFTP 0 27 28
previously 0 27 28
reported, 0 27 28
the 0 27 28
idea 0 27 28
of 0 27 28
not 0 27 28
firing 0 27 28
Guyger 0 27 28
seemed 0 27 28
utterly 1 27 28
preposterous 1 27 28
as 0 27 28
she 0 27 28
admitted 0 27 28
to 0 27 28
doing 0 27 28
something 0 27 28
wrong. 0 27 28

While 0 27 29
controversy 0 27 29
swarms 0 27 29
the 0 27 29
case 0 27 29
of 0 27 29
why 0 27 29
she 0 27 29
may 0 27 29
have 0 27 29
killed 0 27 29
Jean, 0 27 29
there 0 27 29
is 0 27 29
no 0 27 29
doubt 0 27 29
that 0 27 29
she 0 27 29
did 0 27 29
kill 0 27 29
him. 0 27 29

This 0 27 30
is 0 27 30
a 0 27 30
fact. 0 27 30

This 0 27 31
public 0 27 31
servant 0 27 31
walked 0 27 31
into 0 27 31
an 0 27 31
innocent 1 27 31
man’s 0 27 31
home 0 27 31
and 0 27 31
shot 0 27 31
him 0 27 31
dead. 0 27 31

Because 0 27 32
of 0 27 32
her 0 27 32
actions, 0 27 32
this 0 27 32
man 0 27 32
no 0 27 32
longer 0 27 32
lives. 0 27 32

This 0 27 33
alone 0 27 33
should 0 27 33
have 0 27 33
been 0 27 33
enough 0 27 33
to 0 27 33
fire 0 27 33
her. 0 27 33

Surprisingly 0 27 34
enough, 0 27 34
NRA 0 27 34
spokesperson 0 27 34
Dana 0 27 34
Loesch 0 27 34
responded 0 27 34
to 0 27 34
the 0 27 34
firing 0 27 34
of 0 27 34
Guyger 0 27 34
with 0 27 34
one 0 27 34
word, 0 27 34
“Good,” 0 27 34
showing 0 27 34
her 0 27 34
support 0 27 34
for 0 27 34
the 0 27 34
move. 0 27 34

For 0 27 35
those 0 27 35
who 0 27 35
don’t 0 27 35
recall, 0 27 35
Loesch 0 27 35
sparked 0 27 35
controversy 0 27 35
earlier 0 27 35
this 0 27 35
month 0 27 35
by 0 27 35
claiming 0 27 35
that 0 27 35
if 0 27 35
Botham 0 27 35
Jean 0 27 35
were 0 27 35
a 0 27 35
gun 0 27 35
owner, 0 27 35
he 0 27 35
may 0 27 35
be 0 27 35
alive 0 27 35
today. 0 27 35

Indeed, 0 27 36
as 0 27 36
TFTP 0 27 36
reported 0 27 36
over 0 27 36
the 0 27 36
weekend, 0 27 36
a 0 27 36
father 0 27 36
in 0 27 36
Prince 0 27 36
George’s 0 27 36
County 0 27 36
opened 0 27 36
fire 0 27 36
on 0 27 36
officers 0 27 36
as 0 27 36
they 0 27 36
wrongly 0 27 36
entered 0 27 36
his 0 27 36
apartment. 0 27 36

He 0 27 37
shot 0 27 37
two 0 27 37
officers. 0 27 37

Not 0 27 38
only 0 27 38
was 0 27 38
he 0 27 38
not 0 27 38
arrested, 0 27 38
but 0 27 38
the 0 27 38
police 0 27 38
chief 0 27 38
praised 0 27 38
him 0 27 38
and 0 27 38
apologized. 0 27 38

In 0 27 39
response 0 27 39
to 0 27 39
Guyger’s 0 27 39
termination, 0 27 39
the 0 27 39
family’s 0 27 39
attorney, 0 27 39
Lee 0 27 39
Merritt 0 27 39
noted 0 27 39
that 0 27 39
the 0 27 39
family 0 27 39
expressed 0 27 39
“satisfaction” 0 27 39
with 0 27 39
the 0 27 39
move. 0 27 39

“The 0 27 40
Jean 0 27 40
family 0 27 40
expressed 0 27 40
satisfaction 0 27 40
in 0 27 40
this 0 27 40
explanation 0 27 40
and 0 27 40
in 0 27 40
Guyger’s 0 27 40
termination. 0 27 40

We 0 27 41
see 0 27 41
it 0 27 41
as 0 27 41
an 0 27 41
initial 0 27 41

— 0 27 41

the 0 27 41
