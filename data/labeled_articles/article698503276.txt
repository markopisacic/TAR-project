Kerry 0
On 0
Edge 0
As 0
Legacy 0
Crumbles 0

Former 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
John 0
Kerry 0
wasted 0
no 0
time 0
condemning 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
decision 0
not 0
to 0
recertify, 0
and 0
to 0
possibly 0
withdraw 0
from, 0
the 0
disastrous 1
nuclear 1
deal 1
with 0
Iran 0
that 0
Kerry 0
negotiated 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
his 0
boss 0
Barack 0
Obama. 0

President 0
Trump 0
insisted 0
on 0
significant 0
improvements 0
to 0
the 0
Joint 0
Plan 0
of 0
Comprehensive 0
Action 0
(JCPOA), 0
as 0
the 0
deal 0
is 0
formally 0
known. 0

The 0
JCPOA’s 0
fundamental 0
flaws 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
wants 0
fixed 0
include 0
Iran’s 0
ability 0
to 0
block 0
unfettered 0
international 0
inspections, 0
the 0
wiggle 0
room 0
that 0
Iran 0
is 0
exploiting 0
to 0
continue 0
developing 0
and 0
testing 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
capable 0
of 0
delivering 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
and 0
the 0
sunset 0
clause 0
on 0
nuclear 0
enrichment 0
that 0
would 0
provide 0
Iran 0
a 0
clear 0
path 0
to 0
becoming 0
a 0
nuclear 0
armed 0
state 0
after 0
the 0
current 0
restrictions 0
are 0
lifted. 0

Obama 0
and 0
Kerry 0
had 0
promised 0
that 0
these 0
issues 0
would 0
be 0
dealt 0
with 0
satisfactorily 0
before 0
agreeing 0
to 0
the 0
final 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

Instead 0
they 0
caved 0
to 0
Iranian 0
pressure 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
deal 0
done. 0

Now 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
is 0
trying 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
the 1
mess 1
Obama 0
and 0
Kerry 0
left 0
him, 0
Kerry 0
has 0
the 0
gall 0
to 0
label 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
decision 0
a 0
"reckless 1
abandonment 1
of 1
facts 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
ego 1
and 1
ideology" 1
and 0
to 0
accuse 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
of 0
“lying 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people.” 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
Obama 1
administration 1
that 1
recklessly 1
abandoned 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
pressing 1
ahead 1
with 1
the 1
deal. 1

The 1
Obama 1
administration 1
lied 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people, 1
abandoning 0
its 0
own 0
promises 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
deal 0
contained 0
ironclad 0
protections. 0

Moreover, 0
all 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
done 0
so 0
far 0
is 0
to 0
return 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
to 0
Congress 0
for 0
review. 0

Had 0
Obama 0
followed 0
the 0
Constitution 0
and 0
submitted 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
as 0
a 0
treaty 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
in 0
its 0
present 0
form 0
almost 0
certainly 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
approved. 0

Congress 0
should 0
now 0
have 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
revisit 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
protections 0
that 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
promised 0
are 0
working 0
as 0
advertised. 0

Congress 0
should 0
also 0
consider 0
whether 0
time 0
limits 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
commitments 0
continue 0
to 0
make 0
sense 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
are 0
now 0
experiencing 0
with 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
technology 0
collaborator, 0
North 0
Korea. 0

It 0
bought 0
time 0
to 0
turn 0
into 0
a 0
full-fledged 0
nuclear 0
power 0
under 0
our 0
noses. 0

Kerry 0
had 0
promised 0
that 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
would 0
be 0
prohibited 0
from 0
testing 0
ballistic 0
missiles. 0

This 0
turned 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
lie. 0

After 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
was 0
finalized, 0
with 0
no 0
such 0
prohibition 0
included, 0
Iran 0
continued 0
to 0
test 0
such 0
missiles. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
response 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
had 0
become 0
a 0
separate 0
issue, 0
to 0
be 0
dealt 0
with 0
under 0
a 0
new 0
United 0
Nations 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution 0
endorsing 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

The 0
new 0
resolution 0
replaced 0
clear 0
prohibitions 0
imposed 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
program 0
with 0
a 0
weak 0
declaration 0
in 0
an 0
annex 0
that 0
simply 0
“calls 0
upon” 0
Iran 0
not 0
to 0
undertake 0
any 0
activity 0
such 0
as 0
development 0
and 0
test 0
launches 0
related 0
to 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
designed 0
to 0
be 0
capable 0
of 0
delivering 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
for 0
eight 0
years. 0

Iran 0
has 0
tested 0
several 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
during 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
including 0
two 0
Qadr 0
H 0
missiles 0
with 0
the 0
phrase 0
“Israel 1
must 1
be 1
wiped 1
out” 1
emblazoned 0
on 0
the 0
sides. 0

The 0
commander 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
Army, 0
Major 0
General 0
Ataollah 0
Salehi, 0
had 0
told 0
reporters 0
just 0
a 0
month 0
before 0
the 0
launch 0
of 0
those 0
missiles 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
"neither 0
paying 0
any 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
resolutions 0
against 0
Iran, 0
nor 0
implementing 0
them. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
breach 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA.” 0

Russian 0
Ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
Vitaly 0
Churkin, 0
spurning 0
requests 0
from 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
to 0
impose 0
sanctions 0
against 0
Iran 0
under 0
the 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution, 0
asserted 0
that 0
the 0
Iranian 0
missile 0
test 0
did 0
not 0
violate 0
the 0
resolution. 0

“A 0
call 0
is 0
different 0
from 0
a 0
ban 0
so 0
legally 0
you 0
cannot 0
violate 0
a 0
call, 0
you 0
can 0
comply 0
with 0
a 0
call 0
or 0
you 0
can 0
ignore 0
the 0
call, 0
but 0
you 0
cannot 0
violate 0
a 0
call,” 0
the 0
Russian 0
ambassador 0
said. 0

In 0
short, 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
did 0
not 0
cover 0
the 0
missile 0
tests 0
and 0
the 0
replacement 0
UN 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution 0
that 0
did 0
mention 0
the 0
missiles 0
is 0
toothless. 0

Deputy 0
National 0
Security 0
Advisor 0
Ben 0
Rhodes 0
told 0
CNN, 0
during 0
an 0
interview 0
aired 0
on 0
April 0
6, 0
2015, 0
that 0
under 0
the 0
deal’s 0
terms 0
then 0
still 0
being 0
negotiated, 0
“you 0
will 0
have 0
anywhere, 0
anytime, 0
24/7 0
access 0
as 0
it 0
relates 0
to 0
the 0
nuclear 0
facilities 0
that 0
Iran 0
has." 0

Rhodes 0
claimed 0
that 0
“if 0
we 0
see 0
a 0
site 0
that 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
inspect 0
on 0
a 0
military 0
facility, 0
we 0
can 0
get 0
access 0
to 0
that 0
site 0
and 0
inspect 0
it. 0

So 0
if 0
it's 0
a 0
suspicious 0
site 0
that 0
we 0
believe 0
is 0
related 0
to 0
its 0
nuclear 0
efforts, 0
we 0
can 0
get 0
access 0
and 0
inspect 0
that 0
site 0
through 0
the 0
IAEA.” 0
This 1
was 1
another 1
lie. 1

After 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
was 0
finalized 0
in 0
July 0
2015, 0
Rhodes 0
shamelessly 1
denied 1
that 0
anytime, 0
anywhere 0
inspections 0
were 0
ever 0
considered 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
negotiations. 0

“We 0
never 0
sought 0
in 0
this 0
negotiation 0
the 0
capacity 0
for 0
so-called 0
anytime, 0
anywhere,” 0
Rhodes 0
said 0
on 0
July 0
14, 0
2015. 0

The 0
JCPOA’s 0
supporters, 0
including 0
Kerry, 0
have 0
made 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
International 0
Atomic 0
Energy 0
Agency 0
(IAEA) 0
has 0
on 0
several 0
occasions 0
verified 0
Iran’s 0
compliance 0
with 0
its 0
commitments 0
under 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
keeping 0
its 0
stock 0
of 0
low-enriched 0
uranium 0
below 0
the 0
limit 0
set 0
forth 0
in 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
and 0
not 0
pursuing 0
further 0
construction 0
of 0
the 0
Arak 0
reactor. 0

Iran 0
was 0
found 0
to 0
have 0
slightly 0
exceeded 0
the 0
limit 0
on 0
its 0
stock 0
of 0
heavy 0
water, 0
but 0
has 0
remedied 0
the 0
problem 0
to 0
the 0
IAEA’s 0
satisfaction. 0

IAEA 0
chief 0
Yukiya 0
Amano 0
reiterated 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
he 0
issued 0
on 0
October 0
9th 0
that 0
Iran 0
has 0
remained 0
in 0
compliance 0
with 0
its 0
JCPOA 0
commitments. 0

The 0
problem, 0
as 0
any 0
clear-eyed 0
observer 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
recognizes, 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
IAEA 0
relies 0
on 0
Iran 0
for 0
self-inspection 0
of 0
certain 0
sites 0
that 0
the 0
regime 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
the 0
IAEA 0
to 0
inspect 0
freely 0
on 0
its 0
own. 0

IAEA 0
inspectors 0
have 0
avoided 0
examining 0
military 0
sites 0
it 0
knows 0
exists 0
and 0
has 0
no 0
reliable 0
way 0
of 0
tracking 0
undeclared 0
sites. 0

The 0
IAEA’s 0
explanation 0
for 0
not 0
visiting 0
any 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
known 0
military 0
sites 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
“no 0
reason 0
to 0
ask” 0
for 0
access. 0

Evidently, 0
the 0
IAEA 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
block 0
out 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Iran 0
had 0
conducted 0
tests 0
relevant 0
to 0
nuclear 0
bomb 0
detonations 0
at 0
a 0
military 0
site 0
before 0
the 0
JCPOA’s 0
finalization 0
in 0
2015. 0

The 0
IAEA 0
should 0
just 0
pretend 0
that 0
such 0
tests 0
could 0
not 0
possibly 0
happen 0
again. 0

“Nobody 0
is 0
allowed 0
to 0
visit 0
Iran's 0
military 0
sites,” 0
said 0
Iran’s 0
Head 0
of 0
Strategic 0
Research 0
Center 0
at 0
the 0
Expediency 0
Council 0
and 0
adviser 0
to 0
Supreme 0
Leader 0
Ayatollah 0
Khamenei, 0
Ali 0
Akbar 0
Velayati. 0

Intimidation 0
works. 0

The 0
IAEA 0
knows 0
not 0
to 0
ask. 0

As 0
to 0
the 0
JCPOA’s 0
sunset 0
provisions, 0
the 0
Obama 1
administration 1
lied 1
about 1
that 1
too. 1

Kerry 0
claimed 0
on 0
September 0
2, 0
2015 0
that 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
“never 0
sunsets. 0

There’s 0
no 0
sunset 0
in 0
this 0
agreement.” 0

This 0
month 0
Kerry 0
has 0
resorted 0
to 0
parsing 0
words. 0

He 0
claims 0
the 0
phrase 0
'sunset 0
provisions' 0
is 0
a 0
“misnomer,” 0
before 0
then 0
defending 0
the 0
JCPOA’s 0
time 0
limits. 0

"We 0
were 0
comfortable 0
because 0
the 0
cap 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
low-enriched 0
uranium 0
stockpile 0
remains 0
in 0
place 0
until 0
2030,” 0
Kerry 0
wrote 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
late 0
last 0
month. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
let’s 1
just 1
kick 1
the 1
can 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
and 0
hope 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
reasonable 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
in 0
13 0
years 0
that 0
would 0
agree 0
to 0
extend 0
the 0
time 0
limits. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Kerry 0
advises 0
us 0
not 0
to 0
worry. 0

Kerry 0
declared, 0
“15 0
or 0
25 0
years 0
from 0
now, 0
we 0
still 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
military 0
options 0
we 0
have 0
today.” 0

John 0
Kerry 0
has 0
obviously 0
learned 0
nothing 0
from 0
the 0
North 0
Korean 0
fiasco, 1
which 0
resulted 0
from 0
years 0
of 0
phony 1
agreements 1
with 0
the 0
rogue 0
regime 0
and 0
so-called 0
“strategic 0
patience.” 0
The 0
United 0
States 0
clearly 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
military 0
options 0
today 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
a 0
nuclear 0
armed 0
North 0
Korea 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
23 0
years 0
ago 0
when 0
former 0
President 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
use 0
military 0
force 0
to 0
stamp 0
out 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
nuclear 0
program 0
at 0
its 0
inception. 0

Instead, 0
Clinton 0
started 0
us 0
down 0
the 0
primrose 0
path 0
of 0
naïve 0
diplomacy 0
with 0
a 0
duplicitous 0
regime 0
that 0
now 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
verge 0
of 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
strike 0
the 0
U.S. 0
mainland 0
with 0
nuclear 0
warheads 0
delivered 0
by 0
intercontinental 0
ballistic 0
missiles. 0

It 0
is 0
precisely 0
because 0
North 1
Korea’s 1
actions 1
over 1
the 1
last 1
23 1
years 1
have 1
proven 1
that 1
making 1
concessions 1
to 1
a 1
rogue 1
regime 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
obtain 1
denuclearization 1
commitments 1
is 1
so 1
dangerous 1
that 1
President 1
Trump 1
does 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
same 1
mistake 1
with 1
Iran. 1

America’s 0
European 0
allies 0
are 0
also 0
upset 0
with 0
President 0
Trump 0
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
recertify 0
the 0
deal 0
and 0
threatening 0
to 0
pull 0
out 0
if 0
certain 0
conditions 0
are 0
not 0
met. 0

British 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Theresa 0
May, 0
French 0
President 0
Emmanuel 0
Macron 0
and 0
German 0
Chancellor 0
Angela 0
Merkel 0
issued 0
a 0
joint 0
statement 0
last 0
Friday 0
praising 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
and 0
its 0
implementation. 0

They 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran 0
was 0
“the 0
culmination 0
of 0
13 0
years 0
of 0
diplomacy 0
and 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
step 0
towards 0
ensuring 0
that 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
programme 0
is 0
not 0
diverted 0
for 0
military 0
purposes. 0

Therefore, 0
we 0
encourage 0
the 1
US 1
Administration 1
and 1
Congress 1
to 1
consider 1
the 1
implications 1
to 1
the 1
security 1
of 1
the 1
US 1
and 1
its 1
allies 1
before 1
taking 1
any 1
steps 1
that 1
might 1
undermine 1
the 1
JCPOA, 1
such 1
as 1
re-imposing 1
sanctions 1
on 1
Iran 1
lifted 1
under 1
the 1
agreement.” 1

Perhaps 0
these 0
European 0
leaders 0
should 0
remember 0
their 0
own 0
history. 0

Appeasement 1
through 1
phony 1
deals 1
with 1
a 1
rogue 1
dictatorship 1
does 1
not 1
work, 1
as 1
proven 1
by 1
the 1
infamous 1
Munich 1
Pact 1
signed 1
by 1
British 1
and 1
French 1
Prime 1
Ministers 1
Neville 1
Chamberlain 1
and 1
Edouard 1
Daladier 1
with 1
German 1
Chancellor 1
Adolf 1
Hitler 1
seventy-nine 1
years 1
ago. 1
