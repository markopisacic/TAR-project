on 0 294 2
significant 0 294 2
improvements 0 294 2

The 0 294 3
JCPOA’s 0 294 3
fundamental 0 294 3
flaws 0 294 3
that 0 294 3
President 0 294 3
Trump 0 294 3
wants 0 294 3
fixed 0 294 3
include 0 294 3
Iran’s 0 294 3
ability 0 294 3
to 0 294 3
block 0 294 3
unfettered 0 294 3
international 0 294 3

the 0 294 3
wiggle 0 294 3
room 0 294 3
that 0 294 3
Iran 0 294 3
is 0 294 3
exploiting 0 294 3
to 0 294 3
continue 0 294 3

of 0 294 3

and 0 294 3
the 0 294 3
sunset 0 294 3
clause 0 294 3
on 0 294 3
nuclear 0 294 3

that 0 294 3
would 0 294 3
provide 0 294 3
Iran 0 294 3
a 0 294 3
clear 0 294 3
path 0 294 3
to 0 294 3
becoming 0 294 3
a 0 294 3
nuclear 0 294 3

state 0 294 3
after 0 294 3
the 0 294 3
current 0 294 3
restrictions 0 294 3
are 0 294 3
lifted. 0 294 3

Obama 0 294 4
and 0 294 4
Kerry 0 294 4
had 0 294 4
promised 0 294 4
that 0 294 4
these 0 294 4
issues 0 294 4
would 0 294 4
be 0 294 4
dealt 0 294 4
with 0 294 4
satisfactorily 0 294 4
before 0 294 4
agreeing 0 294 4
to 0 294 4
the 0 294 4
final 0 294 4
terms 0 294 4
of 0 294 4
the 0 294 4
JCPOA. 0 294 4

Instead 0 294 5
they 0 294 5
caved 0 294 5
to 0 294 5
Iranian 0 294 5
pressure 0 294 5
in 0 294 5
order 0 294 5
to 0 294 5
get 0 294 5
the 0 294 5
deal 0 294 5
done. 0 294 5

Now 0 294 6
that 0 294 6
President 0 294 6
Trump 0 294 6
is 0 294 6
trying 1 294 6
to 1 294 6
clean 1 294 6
up 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
mess 1 294 6
Obama 0 294 6
and 0 294 6
Kerry 0 294 6
left 0 294 6
him, 0 294 6
Kerry 0 294 6
has 0 294 6
the 0 294 6
gall 0 294 6
to 0 294 6
label 0 294 6
President 0 294 6
Trump’s 0 294 6
decision 0 294 6
a 0 294 6
"reckless 1 294 6
abandonment 1 294 6
of 1 294 6
facts 1 294 6
in 1 294 6
favor 1 294 6
of 1 294 6
ego 1 294 6
and 1 294 6
ideology" 1 294 6
and 0 294 6
to 0 294 6
accuse 0 294 6
the 0 294 6
Trump 0 294 6
administration 0 294 6
of 0 294 6
“lying 1 294 6
to 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
American 1 294 6
people.” 1 294 6
It 1 294 6
was 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
Obama 1 294 6
administration 1 294 6
that 1 294 6
recklessly 1 294 6
abandoned 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
facts 1 294 6
in 1 294 6
pressing 1 294 6
ahead 1 294 6
with 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
deal. 1 294 6

The 1 294 7
Obama 1 294 7
administration 1 294 7
lied 1 294 7
to 1 294 7
the 1 294 7
American 1 294 7
people, 1 294 7
abandoning 0 294 7
its 0 294 7
own 0 294 7
promises 0 294 7
to 0 294 7
ensure 0 294 7
that 0 294 7
the 0 294 7
deal 0 294 7
contained 0 294 7
ironclad 0 294 7
protections. 0 294 7

Moreover, 0 294 8
all 0 294 8
that 0 294 8
President 0 294 8
Trump 0 294 8
has 0 294 8
done 0 294 8
so 0 294 8
far 0 294 8
is 0 294 8
to 0 294 8
return 0 294 8
the 0 294 8
JCPOA 0 294 8
to 0 294 8
Congress 0 294 8
for 0 294 8
review. 0 294 8

Had 0 294 9
Obama 0 294 9
followed 0 294 9
the 0 294 9
Constitution 0 294 9
and 0 294 9
submitted 0 294 9
the 0 294 9
JCPOA 0 294 9
to 0 294 9
the 0 294 9
Senate 0 294 9
as 0 294 9
a 0 294 9
treaty 0 294 9
in 0 294 9
the 0 294 9
first 0 294 9
place, 0 294 9
the 0 294 9
JCPOA 0 294 9
in 0 294 9
its 0 294 9
present 0 294 9
form 0 294 9
almost 0 294 9
certainly 0 294 9
would 0 294 9
not 0 294 9
have 0 294 9
been 0 294 9
approved. 0 294 9

Congress 0 294 10
should 0 294 10
now 0 294 10
have 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
opportunity 0 294 10
to 0 294 10
revisit 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
JCPOA 0 294 10
to 0 294 10
determine 0 294 10
whether 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
protections 0 294 10
that 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
Obama 0 294 10
administration 0 294 10
promised 0 294 10
are 0 294 10
working 0 294 10
as 0 294 10
advertised. 0 294 10

Congress 0 294 11
should 0 294 11
also 0 294 11
consider 0 294 11
whether 0 294 11
time 0 294 11
limits 0 294 11
on 0 294 11
Iran’s 0 294 11
commitments 0 294 11
continue 0 294 11
to 0 294 11
make 0 294 11
sense 0 294 11
in 0 294 11
light 0 294 11
of 0 294 11
what 0 294 11
we 0 294 11
are 0 294 11
now 0 294 11
experiencing 0 294 11
with 0 294 11
Iran’s 0 294 11
nuclear 0 294 11
technology 0 294 11
collaborator, 0 294 11
North 0 294 11
Korea. 0 294 11

It 0 294 12
bought 0 294 12
time 0 294 12
to 0 294 12
turn 0 294 12
into 0 294 12
a 0 294 12
full-fledged 0 294 12
nuclear 0 294 12
power 0 294 12
under 0 294 12
our 0 294 12
noses. 0 294 12

Kerry 0 294 13
had 0 294 13
promised 0 294 13
that 0 294 13
the 0 294 13
Iranian 0 294 13
regime 0 294 13
would 0 294 13
be 0 294 13
prohibited 0 294 13
from 0 294 13
testing 0 294 13
ballistic 0 294 13
missiles. 0 294 13

This 0 294 14
turned 0 294 14
out 0 294 14
to 0 294 14
be 0 294 14
a 0 294 14
lie. 0 294 14

After 0 294 15
the 0 294 15
JCPOA 0 294 15
was 0 294 15
finalized, 0 294 15
with 0 294 15
no 0 294 15
such 0 294 15
prohibition 0 294 15
included, 0 294 15
Iran 0 294 15
continued 0 294 15
to 0 294 15
test 0 294 15
such 0 294 15
missiles. 0 294 15

The 0 294 16
Obama 0 294 16
administration’s 0 294 16
response 0 294 16
was 0 294 16
that 0 294 16
the 0 294 16
missiles 0 294 16
had 0 294 16
become 0 294 16
a 0 294 16
separate 0 294 16
issue, 0 294 16
to 0 294 16
be 0 294 16
dealt 0 294 16
with 0 294 16
under 0 294 16

the 0 294 16
JCPOA. 0 294 16

The 0 294 17
new 0 294 17
resolution 0 294 17
replaced 0 294 17
clear 0 294 17
prohibitions 0 294 17
imposed 0 294 17
on 0 294 17
Iran’s 0 294 17
ballistic 0 294 17

program 0 294 17
with 0 294 17
a 0 294 17
weak 0 294 17
declaration 0 294 17
in 0 294 17
an 0 294 17
annex 0 294 17
that 0 294 17
simply 0 294 17
“calls 0 294 17
upon” 0 294 17
Iran 0 294 17
not 0 294 17
to 0 294 17

for 0 294 17
eight 0 294 17
years. 0 294 17

Iran 0 294 18
has 0 294 18
tested 0 294 18
several 0 294 18
ballistic 0 294 18
missiles 0 294 18
during 0 294 18
the 0 294 18

out” 1 294 18
emblazoned 0 294 18
on 0 294 18
the 0 294 18
sides. 0 294 18

The 0 294 19
commander 0 294 19
of 0 294 19

Major 0 294 19
General 0 294 19
Ataollah 0 294 19
Salehi, 0 294 19
had 0 294 19
told 0 294 19
reporters 0 294 19
just 0 294 19
a 0 294 19
month 0 294 19
before 0 294 19
the 0 294 19
launch 0 294 19
of 0 294 19
those 0 294 19
missiles 0 294 19
that 0 294 19
Iran 0 294 19
was 0 294 19
"neither 0 294 19

This 0 294 20

“A 0 294 22

In 0 294 23
short, 0 294 23
the 0 294 23

inspect 0 294 25
on 0 294 25
a 0 294 25
military 0 294 25
facility, 0 294 25
we 0 294 25
can 0 294 25
get 0 294 25
access 0 294 25
to 0 294 25
that 0 294 25
site 0 294 25
and 0 294 25
inspect 0 294 25
it. 0 294 25

So 0 294 26
if 0 294 26
it's 0 294 26
a 0 294 26
suspicious 0 294 26
site 0 294 26
that 0 294 26
we 0 294 26
believe 0 294 26
is 0 294 26
related 0 294 26
to 0 294 26
its 0 294 26
nuclear 0 294 26
efforts, 0 294 26
we 0 294 26
can 0 294 26
get 0 294 26
access 0 294 26
and 0 294 26
inspect 0 294 26
that 0 294 26
site 0 294 26
through 0 294 26
the 0 294 26
IAEA.” 0 294 26
This 1 294 26
was 1 294 26
another 1 294 26
lie. 1 294 26

After 0 294 27
the 0 294 27
JCPOA 0 294 27
was 0 294 27
finalized 0 294 27
in 0 294 27
July 0 294 27
2015, 0 294 27
Rhodes 0 294 27
shamelessly 1 294 27
denied 1 294 27
that 0 294 27
anytime, 0 294 27
anywhere 0 294 27
inspections 0 294 27
were 0 294 27
ever 0 294 27
considered 0 294 27
as 0 294 27
part 0 294 27
of 0 294 27
the 0 294 27
negotiations. 0 294 27

“We 0 294 28
never 0 294 28
sought 0 294 28
in 0 294 28
this 0 294 28
negotiation 0 294 28
the 0 294 28
capacity 0 294 28

so-called 0 294 28
anytime, 0 294 28
anywhere,” 0 294 28
Rhodes 0 294 28

on 0 294 28
July 0 294 28
14, 0 294 28
2015. 0 294 28

The 0 294 29
JCPOA’s 0 294 29
supporters, 0 294 29
including 0 294 29
Kerry, 0 294 29
have 0 294 29
made 0 294 29
much 0 294 29
of 0 294 29
the 0 294 29
fact 0 294 29
that 0 294 29
the 0 294 29
International 0 294 29
Atomic 0 294 29
Energy 0 294 29
Agency 0 294 29
(IAEA) 0 294 29
has 0 294 29
on 0 294 29
several 0 294 29
occasions 0 294 29
verified 0 294 29
Iran’s 0 294 29
compliance 0 294 29
with 0 294 29
its 0 294 29
commitments 0 294 29
under 0 294 29
the 0 294 29
JCPOA, 0 294 29
keeping 0 294 29
its 0 294 29
stock 0 294 29
of 0 294 29
low-enriched 0 294 29
uranium 0 294 29
below 0 294 29
the 0 294 29

set 0 294 29
forth 0 294 29
in 0 294 29
the 0 294 29
JCPOA 0 294 29

not 0 294 29
pursuing 0 294 29
further 0 294 29
construction 0 294 29
of 0 294 29
the 0 294 29

Iran 0 294 30
was 0 294 30
found 0 294 30
to 0 294 30
have 0 294 30
slightly 0 294 30
exceeded 0 294 30
the 0 294 30
limit 0 294 30
on 0 294 30
its 0 294 30
stock 0 294 30
of 0 294 30
heavy 0 294 30
water, 0 294 30
but 0 294 30
has 0 294 30
remedied 0 294 30
the 0 294 30
problem 0 294 30
to 0 294 30
the 0 294 30
IAEA’s 0 294 30
satisfaction. 0 294 30

IAEA 0 294 31
chief 0 294 31
Yukiya 0 294 31
Amano 0 294 31
reiterated 0 294 31
in 0 294 31
a 0 294 31
statement 0 294 31
he 0 294 31
issued 0 294 31
on 0 294 31
October 0 294 31
9th 0 294 31
that 0 294 31
Iran 0 294 31
has 0 294 31
remained 0 294 31
in 0 294 31
compliance 0 294 31
with 0 294 31
its 0 294 31
JCPOA 0 294 31
commitments. 0 294 31

The 0 294 32
problem, 0 294 32
as 0 294 32
any 0 294 32
clear-eyed 0 294 32
observer 0 294 32
of 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
process 0 294 32
recognizes, 0 294 32
is 0 294 32
that 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
IAEA 0 294 32
relies 0 294 32
on 0 294 32
Iran 0 294 32
for 0 294 32
self-inspection 0 294 32
of 0 294 32
certain 0 294 32
sites 0 294 32
that 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
regime 0 294 32
does 0 294 32
not 0 294 32
want 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
IAEA 0 294 32
to 0 294 32
inspect 0 294 32
freely 0 294 32
on 0 294 32
its 0 294 32
own. 0 294 32

IAEA 0 294 33
inspectors 0 294 33
have 0 294 33
avoided 0 294 33
examining 0 294 33
military 0 294 33
sites 0 294 33
it 0 294 33
knows 0 294 33
exists 0 294 33
and 0 294 33
has 0 294 33
no 0 294 33
reliable 0 294 33
way 0 294 33
of 0 294 33
tracking 0 294 33
undeclared 0 294 33
sites. 0 294 33

The 0 294 34
IAEA’s 0 294 34
explanation 0 294 34
for 0 294 34
not 0 294 34
visiting 0 294 34
any 0 294 34
of 0 294 34
Iran’s 0 294 34
known 0 294 34
military 0 294 34
sites 0 294 34
is 0 294 34
that 0 294 34
it 0 294 34
had 0 294 34
“no 0 294 34
reason 0 294 34
to 0 294 34
ask” 0 294 34
for 0 294 34
access. 0 294 34

Evidently, 0 294 35
the 0 294 35
IAEA 0 294 35
is 0 294 35
supposed 0 294 35
to 0 294 35
block 0 294 35
out 0 294 35
the 0 294 35
fact 0 294 35
that 0 294 35
Iran 0 294 35
had 0 294 35
conducted 0 294 35
tests 0 294 35
relevant 0 294 35
to 0 294 35
nuclear 0 294 35
bomb 0 294 35
detonations 0 294 35
at 0 294 35
a 0 294 35
military 0 294 35
site 0 294 35
before 0 294 35
the 0 294 35
JCPOA’s 0 294 35
finalization 0 294 35
in 0 294 35
2015. 0 294 35

The 0 294 36
IAEA 0 294 36
should 0 294 36
just 0 294 36
pretend 0 294 36
that 0 294 36
such 0 294 36
tests 0 294 36
could 0 294 36
not 0 294 36
possibly 0 294 36
happen 0 294 36
again. 0 294 36

“Nobody 0 294 37
is 0 294 37
allowed 0 294 37
to 0 294 37
visit 0 294 37
Iran's 0 294 37
military 0 294 37
sites,” 0 294 37
said 0 294 37
Iran’s 0 294 37
Head 0 294 37
of 0 294 37
Strategic 0 294 37
Research 0 294 37
Center 0 294 37

Intimidation 0 294 38
works. 0 294 38

The 0 294 39
IAEA 0 294 39
knows 0 294 39
not 0 294 39
to 0 294 39
ask. 0 294 39

As 0 294 40
to 0 294 40
the 0 294 40
JCPOA’s 0 294 40
sunset 0 294 40
provisions, 0 294 40
the 0 294 40
Obama 1 294 40
administration 1 294 40
lied 1 294 40
about 1 294 40
that 1 294 40
too. 1 294 40

Kerry 0 294 41
claimed 0 294 41
on 0 294 41
September 0 294 41
2, 0 294 41
2015 0 294 41
that 0 294 41
the 0 294 41
JCPOA 0 294 41
“never 0 294 41
sunsets. 0 294 41

There’s 0 294 42
no 0 294 42
sunset 0 294 42
in 0 294 42
this 0 294 42
agreement.” 0 294 42

This 0 294 43
month 0 294 43
Kerry 0 294 43
has 0 294 43
resorted 0 294 43
to 0 294 43
parsing 0 294 43
words. 0 294 43

He 0 294 44
claims 0 294 44
the 0 294 44
phrase 0 294 44
'sunset 0 294 44
provisions' 0 294 44
is 0 294 44
a 0 294 44
“misnomer,” 0 294 44
before 0 294 44
then 0 294 44
defending 0 294 44
the 0 294 44
JCPOA’s 0 294 44
time 0 294 44
limits. 0 294 44

"We 0 294 45
were 0 294 45
comfortable 0 294 45
because 0 294 45
the 0 294 45
cap 0 294 45
on 0 294 45
Iran’s 0 294 45
low-enriched 0 294 45
uranium 0 294 45
stockpile 0 294 45
remains 0 294 45
in 0 294 45
place 0 294 45
until 0 294 45
2030,” 0 294 45
Kerry 0 294 45
wrote 0 294 45
in 0 294 45
an 0 294 45
article 0 294 45
published 0 294 45
in 0 294 45
the 0 294 45
Washington 0 294 45
Post 0 294 45
late 0 294 45
last 0 294 45
month. 0 294 45

In 0 294 46
other 0 294 46
words, 0 294 46
let’s 1 294 46
just 1 294 46
kick 1 294 46
the 1 294 46
can 1 294 46
down 1 294 46
the 1 294 46
road 1 294 46
and 0 294 46
hope 0 294 46
for 0 294 46
a 0 294 46
more 0 294 46
reasonable 0 294 46
Iranian 0 294 46
regime 0 294 46
in 0 294 46
13 0 294 46
years 0 294 46
that 0 294 46
would 0 294 46
agree 0 294 46
to 0 294 46
extend 0 294 46
the 0 294 46
time 0 294 46
limits. 0 294 46

In 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
meantime, 0 294 47
Kerry 0 294 47
advises 0 294 47
us 0 294 47
not 0 294 47
to 0 294 47
worry. 0 294 47

Kerry 0 294 48
declared, 0 294 48
“15 0 294 48
or 0 294 48
25 0 294 48
years 0 294 48
from 0 294 48
now, 0 294 48
we 0 294 48
still 0 294 48
have 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
same 0 294 48
military 0 294 48
options 0 294 48
we 0 294 48
have 0 294 48
today.” 0 294 48

John 0 294 49
Kerry 0 294 49
has 0 294 49
obviously 0 294 49
learned 0 294 49
nothing 0 294 49
from 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
North 0 294 49
Korean 0 294 49
fiasco, 1 294 49
which 0 294 49
resulted 0 294 49
from 0 294 49
years 0 294 49
of 0 294 49
phony 1 294 49
agreements 1 294 49
with 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
rogue 0 294 49
regime 0 294 49
and 0 294 49
so-called 0 294 49
“strategic 0 294 49
patience.” 0 294 49
The 0 294 49
United 0 294 49
States 0 294 49
clearly 0 294 49
does 0 294 49
not 0 294 49
have 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
same 0 294 49
military 0 294 49
options 0 294 49
today 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
deal 0 294 49
with 0 294 49
a 0 294 49
nuclear 0 294 49
armed 0 294 49
North 0 294 49
Korea 0 294 49
as 0 294 49
it 0 294 49
did 0 294 49
23 0 294 49
years 0 294 49
ago 0 294 49
when 0 294 49
former 0 294 49
President 0 294 49
Bill 0 294 49
Clinton 0 294 49
decided 0 294 49
not 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
use 0 294 49
military 0 294 49
force 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
stamp 0 294 49
out 0 294 49
North 0 294 49
Korea’s 0 294 49
nuclear 0 294 49
program 0 294 49
at 0 294 49
its 0 294 49
inception. 0 294 49

Instead, 0 294 50
Clinton 0 294 50
started 0 294 50
us 0 294 50
down 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
primrose 0 294 50
path 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
naïve 0 294 50
diplomacy 0 294 50
with 0 294 50
a 0 294 50
duplicitous 0 294 50
regime 0 294 50
that 0 294 50
now 0 294 50
is 0 294 50
on 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
verge 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
being 0 294 50
able 0 294 50
to 0 294 50
strike 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
U.S. 0 294 50
mainland 0 294 50
with 0 294 50
nuclear 0 294 50
warheads 0 294 50
delivered 0 294 50
by 0 294 50
intercontinental 0 294 50
ballistic 0 294 50
missiles. 0 294 50

It 0 294 51
is 0 294 51
precisely 0 294 51
because 0 294 51
North 1 294 51
Korea’s 1 294 51
actions 1 294 51
over 1 294 51
the 1 294 51
last 1 294 51
23 1 294 51
years 1 294 51
have 1 294 51
proven 1 294 51
that 1 294 51
making 1 294 51
concessions 1 294 51
to 1 294 51
a 1 294 51
rogue 1 294 51
regime 1 294 51
in 1 294 51
order 1 294 51
to 1 294 51
obtain 1 294 51
denuclearization 1 294 51
commitments 1 294 51
is 1 294 51
so 1 294 51
dangerous 1 294 51
that 1 294 51
President 1 294 51
Trump 1 294 51
does 1 294 51
not 1 294 51
want 1 294 51
to 1 294 51
make 1 294 51
the 1 294 51
same 1 294 51
mistake 1 294 51
with 1 294 51
Iran. 1 294 51

America’s 0 294 52
European 0 294 52
allies 0 294 52
are 0 294 52
also 0 294 52
upset 0 294 52
with 0 294 52
President 0 294 52
Trump 0 294 52
for 0 294 52
refusing 0 294 52
to 0 294 52
recertify 0 294 52
the 0 294 52
deal 0 294 52
and 0 294 52
threatening 0 294 52
to 0 294 52
pull 0 294 52
out 0 294 52
if 0 294 52
certain 0 294 52
conditions 0 294 52
are 0 294 52
not 0 294 52

a 0 294 53
joint 0 294 53
statement 0 294 53
last 0 294 53
Friday 0 294 53
praising 0 294 53
the 0 294 53
JCPOA 0 294 53
and 0 294 53
its 0 294 53
implementation. 0 294 53

They 0 294 54
said 0 294 54
that 0 294 54
the 0 294 54
nuclear 0 294 54
deal 0 294 54
with 0 294 54
Iran 0 294 54
was 0 294 54
“the 0 294 54
culmination 0 294 54
of 0 294 54
13 0 294 54
years 0 294 54
of 0 294 54
diplomacy 0 294 54
and 0 294 54
was 0 294 54
a 0 294 54
major 0 294 54
step 0 294 54
towards 0 294 54
ensuring 0 294 54
that 0 294 54
Iran’s 0 294 54
nuclear 0 294 54
programme 0 294 54
is 0 294 54
not 0 294 54
diverted 0 294 54
for 0 294 54
military 0 294 54
purposes. 0 294 54

Therefore, 0 294 55
we 0 294 55
encourage 0 294 55
the 1 294 55
US 1 294 55
Administration 1 294 55
and 1 294 55
Congress 1 294 55
to 1 294 55
consider 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
implications 1 294 55
to 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
security 1 294 55
of 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
US 1 294 55
and 1 294 55
its 1 294 55
allies 1 294 55
before 1 294 55
taking 1 294 55
any 1 294 55
steps 1 294 55
that 1 294 55
might 1 294 55
undermine 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
JCPOA, 1 294 55
such 1 294 55
as 1 294 55
re-imposing 1 294 55
sanctions 1 294 55
on 1 294 55
Iran 1 294 55
lifted 1 294 55
under 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
agreement.” 1 294 55

Perhaps 0 294 56
these 0 294 56
European 0 294 56
leaders 0 294 56
should 0 294 56
remember 0 294 56
