“It 0 193 25

lawyer, 0 193 25
Greg 0 193 25

said. 0 193 25

“It’s 0 193 26
a 0 193 26
very 0 193 26
sad 0 193 26
case 0 193 26
because 0 193 26
Kristian 0 193 26
Saucier 0 193 26
is 0 193 26
a 1 193 26
fine 1 193 26
young 1 193 26
man. 1 193 26

We 0 193 27
don’t 0 193 27
believe 0 193 27
this 0 193 27
was 0 193 27
really 0 193 27
his 0 193 27
true 0 193 27
character.” 0 193 27

“My 0 193 28
case 0 193 28
was 0 193 28
usually 0 193 28
something 0 193 28
handled 0 193 28
by 0 193 28
military 0 193 28
courts,” 0 193 28
Saucier 0 193 28
said. 0 193 28

“They 1 193 29
used 1 193 29
me 1 193 29
as 1 193 29
an 1 193 29
example 1 193 29
because 1 193 29
of 1 193 29
[the 1 193 29
backlash 1 193 29
over] 1 193 29
Hillary 1 193 29
Clinton,” 1 193 29
he 0 193 29
continued, 0 193 29
alleging 0 193 29
his 0 193 29
life 0 193 29
was 0 193 29
ruined 0 193 29
for 0 193 29
political 0 193 29
reasons. 0 193 29

President 0 193 30
Trump 0 193 30
had 0 193 30
spoken 0 193 30
of 0 193 30
his 0 193 30
support 0 193 30
of 0 193 30
Saucier 0 193 30
on 0 193 30
the 0 193 30
campaign 0 193 30
trail 0 193 30
and 0 193 30
blasted 0 193 30
the 0 193 30
Obama 0 193 30
administration's 0 193 30
handling 0 193 30
of 0 193 30
his 0 193 30
case. 0 193 30

“With 0 193 31
a 0 193 31
pardon, 0 193 31
there’s 0 193 31
no 0 193 31
magic 0 193 31
wand 0 193 31
that 0 193 31
gets 0 193 31
waved 0 193 31
and 0 193 31
makes 0 193 31
everything 0 193 31
right,” 0 193 31
Saucier 0 193 31
said, 0 193 31
“But 0 193 31
I 0 193 31
try 0 193 31
to 0 193 31
stay 0 193 31
positive 0 193 31
and 0 193 31
look 0 193 31
forward.” 0 193 31

That's 0 193 32
a 0 193 32
good 0 193 32
attitude 0 193 32

hey, 0 193 33
Hillary 0 193 33

That's 0 193 34
all 0 193 34
that 0 193 34
matters, 0 193 34
cause 0 193 34
after 0 193 34

pardoned, 0 193 35
I 0 193 35
really 0 193 35
do, 0 193 35
but 0 193 35
I 0 193 35
continue 0 193 35
to 0 193 35
ask 0 193 35
what 0 193 35
a 0 193 35
lot 0 193 35
of 0 193 35
Americans 1 193 35
continue 0 193 35
to 0 193 35
ask, 0 193 35
why 0 193 35
does 0 193 35
the 1 193 35

our 1 193 35
country 1 193 35
with 0 193 35
her 0 193 35
corrupt 1 193 35
foundation 0 193 35
taking 0 193 35
in 0 193 35
billions, 0 193 35
her 0 193 35
trashing 1 193 35
our 1 193 35
Republic 1 193 35
and 0 193 35
continuing 0 193 35
to 0 193 35
have 0 193 35
a 0 193 35
national 0 193 35
voice? 0 193 35

The 1 193 36
American 1 193 36
people 1 193 36
weren't 0 193 36
promised 0 193 36
pardons, 0 193 36
we 0 193 36

It's 0 193 37

that 0 193 37
occurred. 0 193 37
