off 0 245 22

“It 0 245 25

Saucier’s 0 245 25
lawyer, 0 245 25
Greg 0 245 25

said. 0 245 25

“It’s 0 245 26
a 0 245 26
very 0 245 26
sad 0 245 26
case 0 245 26
because 0 245 26
Kristian 0 245 26
Saucier 0 245 26
is 0 245 26
a 1 245 26
fine 1 245 26
young 1 245 26
man. 1 245 26

We 0 245 27
don’t 0 245 27
believe 0 245 27
this 0 245 27
was 0 245 27
really 0 245 27
his 0 245 27
true 0 245 27
character.” 0 245 27

“My 0 245 28
case 0 245 28
was 0 245 28
usually 0 245 28
something 0 245 28
handled 0 245 28
by 0 245 28
military 0 245 28
courts,” 0 245 28
Saucier 0 245 28
said. 0 245 28

“They 1 245 29
used 1 245 29
me 1 245 29
as 1 245 29
an 1 245 29
example 1 245 29
because 1 245 29
of 1 245 29
[the 1 245 29
backlash 1 245 29
over] 1 245 29
Hillary 1 245 29
Clinton,” 1 245 29
he 0 245 29
continued, 0 245 29
alleging 0 245 29
his 0 245 29
life 0 245 29
was 0 245 29
ruined 0 245 29
for 0 245 29
political 0 245 29
reasons. 0 245 29

President 0 245 30
Trump 0 245 30
had 0 245 30
spoken 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
his 0 245 30
support 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
Saucier 0 245 30
on 0 245 30
the 0 245 30
campaign 0 245 30
trail 0 245 30
and 0 245 30
blasted 0 245 30
the 0 245 30
Obama 0 245 30
administration's 0 245 30
handling 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
his 0 245 30
case. 0 245 30

“With 0 245 31
a 0 245 31
pardon, 0 245 31
there’s 0 245 31
no 0 245 31
magic 0 245 31
wand 0 245 31
that 0 245 31
gets 0 245 31
waved 0 245 31
and 0 245 31
makes 0 245 31
everything 0 245 31
right,” 0 245 31
Saucier 0 245 31
said, 0 245 31
“But 0 245 31
I 0 245 31
try 0 245 31
to 0 245 31
stay 0 245 31
positive 0 245 31
and 0 245 31
look 0 245 31
forward.” 0 245 31

That's 0 245 32
a 0 245 32
good 0 245 32
attitude 0 245 32
considering 0 245 32
he 0 245 32

That's 0 245 34
all 0 245 34
that 0 245 34

cause 0 245 34
after 0 245 34

I 0 245 35
really 0 245 35
do, 0 245 35
but 0 245 35
I 0 245 35
continue 0 245 35
to 0 245 35
ask 0 245 35

ask, 0 245 35
why 0 245 35
does 0 245 35
the 1 245 35

our 1 245 35
country 1 245 35
with 0 245 35
her 0 245 35
corrupt 1 245 35
foundation 0 245 35
taking 0 245 35
in 0 245 35
billions, 0 245 35
her 0 245 35
trashing 1 245 35
our 1 245 35
Republic 1 245 35
and 0 245 35
continuing 0 245 35
to 0 245 35
have 0 245 35
a 0 245 35
national 0 245 35
voice? 0 245 35

The 1 245 36
American 1 245 36
people 1 245 36
weren't 0 245 36
promised 0 245 36
pardons, 0 245 36
we 0 245 36
