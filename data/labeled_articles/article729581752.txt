In 0 150 1
what 0 150 1
is 0 150 1
being 0 150 1

a 0 150 1

rare 0 150 1
event, 0 150 1
scientists 0 150 1
are 0 150 1
projecting 0 150 1
that 0 150 1
the 0 150 1

from 0 150 2

of 0 150 2

experts 0 150 2
are 0 150 2
predicting 0 150 2
a 0 150 2
“Grand 0 150 2
Solar 0 150 2
Minimum” 0 150 2
will 0 150 2
occur 0 150 2
a 0 150 2
few 0 150 2
decades 0 150 2

been 0 150 2
for 0 150 2

very 0 150 2

The 0 150 3
Sun 0 150 3
might 0 150 3
look 0 150 3
the 0 150 3
same 0 150 3
to 0 150 3
you 0 150 3
today 0 150 3
as 0 150 3
it 0 150 3
has 0 150 3
since 0 150 3
the 0 150 3
first 0 150 3
time 0 150 3
you 0 150 3
laid 0 150 3
eyes 0 150 3
on 0 150 3
it, 0 150 3
but 0 150 3
our 0 150 3
star 0 150 3
actually 0 150 3
displays 0 150 3
plenty 0 150 3
of 0 150 3
changes. 0 150 3

The 0 150 4
Sun 0 150 4
goes 0 150 4
through 0 150 4
regular 0 150 4
cycles 0 150 4
of 0 150 4
solar 0 150 4
minimums 0 150 4
and 0 150 4
solar 0 150 4
maximums, 0 150 4
which 0 150 4
are 0 150 4
periods 0 150 4
where 0 150 4
the 0 150 4
Sun 0 150 4
is 0 150 4
either 0 150 4
quite 0 150 4
calm 0 150 4
(the 0 150 4
minimum) 0 150 4
or 0 150 4

These 0 150 5
patterns 0 150 5
repeat 0 150 5
every 0 150 5
11 0 150 5
years 0 150 5
or 0 150 5
so, 0 150 5
but 0 150 5
new 0 150 5
research 0 150 5
suggests 0 150 5
that 0 150 5
there’s 0 150 5
a 0 150 5
pattern 0 150 5
behind 0 150 5
the 0 150 5
pattern, 0 150 5
and 0 150 5
that 0 150 5
a 0 150 5

cool 0 150 5
solar 0 150 5

Astrophysical 0 150 6

After 0 150 7
combing 0 150 7
the 0 150 7
data, 0 150 7
Lubin’s 0 150 7
team 0 150 7
has 0 150 7
forecasted 0 150 7
a 0 150 7
grand 0 150 7
minimum 0 150 7
that 0 150 7
will 0 150 7
be 0 150 7
around 0 150 7
seven 0 150 7
percent 0 150 7
cooler 0 150 7
than 0 150 7
the 0 150 7
typical 0 150 7
solar 0 150 7
minimum, 0 150 7
making 0 150 7
it 0 150 7
a 0 150 7
particularly 0 150 7
calm 0 150 7
moment 0 150 7
for 0 150 7
our 0 150 7

During 0 150 8
a 0 150 8
solar 0 150 8
minimum, 0 150 8
the 0 150 8
Sun 0 150 8
produces 0 150 8
far 0 150 8
fewer 0 150 8
solar 0 150 8
flares 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
sunspots, 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
as 0 150 8
a 0 150 8
result, 0 150 8
much 0 150 8
less 0 150 8

This 0 150 9
can 0 150 9
have 0 150 9
a 0 150 9
number 0 150 9
of 0 150 9
effects 0 150 9
on 0 150 9
our 0 150 9
planet, 0 150 9
including 0 150 9
changes 0 150 9
in 0 150 9
the 0 150 9

of 0 150 9
the 0 150 9

temperatures 0 150 9
far 0 150 9
above 0 150 9
ground. 0 150 9

Those 0 150 10
changes 0 150 10
can 0 150 10
affect 0 150 10
weather, 0 150 10
though 0 150 10
forecasting 0 150 10
specific 0 150 10
differences 0 150 10
has 0 150 10
proven 0 150 10
difficult. 0 150 10

The 0 150 11
grand 0 150 11
minimum 0 150 11
will 0 150 11
be 0 150 11
an 0 150 11
exaggerated 0 150 11
version 0 150 11
of 0 150 11
the 0 150 11
typical 0 150 11
solar 0 150 11
minimum, 0 150 11
and 0 150 11
could 0 150 11
produce 0 150 11
some 0 150 11
very 0 150 11
noticeable 0 150 11
effects. 0 150 11

The 0 150 12
most 0 150 12
recent 0 150 12
grand 0 150 12
minimum 0 150 12
is 0 150 12
thought 0 150 12
to 0 150 12
have 0 150 12
occurred 0 150 12
back 0 150 12
in 0 150 12
the 0 150 12
mid 0 150 12
1600s. 0 150 12

The 0 150 13
event, 0 150 13
called 0 150 13
the 0 150 13
Maunder 0 150 13
Minimum, 0 150 13
is 0 150 13
credited 0 150 13
with 0 150 13
plunging 0 150 13
temperatures 0 150 13
to 0 150 13
the 0 150 13
point 0 150 13
where 0 150 13
the 0 150 13
Thames 0 150 13
River 0 150 13
and 0 150 13
Baltic 0 150 13

over. 0 150 13

However, 0 150 14
other 0 150 14
parts 0 150 14
of 0 150 14
the 0 150 14
planet 0 150 14
heated 0 150 14
up, 0 150 14
including 0 150 14
Alaska 0 150 14

Greenland, 0 150 14
to 0 150 14
far 0 150 14

their 0 150 14
normal 0 150 14

This 0 150 14

temporary 0 150 14

shakeup 0 150 14

of 0 150 14

temperatures 0 150 14

could 0 150 14

happen 0 150 14

again, 0 150 14

though 0 150 14

the 0 150 14

researchers 1 150 14

it 1 150 14

will 1 150 14

have 1 150 14

very 1 150 14

little 1 150 14
