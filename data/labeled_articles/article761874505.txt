“They 0
interpreted 0
the 0
law 0
in 0
my 0
case 0
to 0
say 0
it 0
was 0
criminal,” 0
Saucier 0
told 0
Fox 0
News, 0
referring 0
to 0
prosecuting 0
authorities 0
in 0
his 0
case, 0
“but 1
they 1
didn’t 1
prosecute 1
Hillary 1
Clinton. 1

Hillary 0
is 0
still 0
walking 0
free. 0

Two 1
guys 1
on 1
my 1
ship 1
did 1
the 1
same 1
thing 1
and 1
weren’t 1
treated 1
as 1
criminals. 1

We 0
want 0
them 0
to 0
correct 0
the 0
wrong.” 0
Daigle 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
notice 0
about 0
the 0
pending 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
others 0
included 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
December. 0

There 0
is 0
usually 0
a 0
six-month 0
period 0
that 0
must 0
elapse 0
before 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
actually 0
is 0
actually 0
filed. 0

“My 0
case 0
was 0
usually 0
something 0
handled 0
by 0
military 0
courts,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“They 1
used 1
me 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
because 1
of 1
[the 1
backlash 1
over] 1
Hillary 1
Clinton,” 1
he 0
continued, 0
alleging 0
his 0
life 0
was 0
ruined 0
for 0
political 0
reasons. 0

“With 0
a 0
pardon, 0
there’s 0
no 0
magic 0
wand 0
that 0
gets 0
waved 0
and 0
makes 0
everything 0
right,” 0
Saucier 0
said, 0
“But 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
stay 0
positive 0
and 0
look 0
forward.” 0
Saucier 0
has 0
had 0
cars 0
repossessed 0
and 0
is 0
in 0
debt 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
income 0
after 0
having 0
a 0
felony 0
on 0
his 0
record. 0

The 0
government 0
actively 1
destroyed 1
his 1
life 1
an 1
made 1
it 1
all 1
but 1
impossible 1
for 0
his 0
family 0
to 0
get 0
back 0
on 0
track. 0

But 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
is 0
running 0
around 0
free, 1
to 0
this 0
day. 0

And 0
that 0
is 0
what 0
Saucier 0
is 0
so 0
burnt 0
about, 0
with 1
good 1
reason. 1
