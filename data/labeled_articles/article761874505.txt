on 0 76 2
which 0 76 2
he 0 76 2
worked, 0 76 2

lashed 0 76 4
out 0 76 4
at 0 76 4
Obama 0 76 4
officials, 0 76 4
saying 0 76 4
that 0 76 4
his 0 76 4
prosecution 0 76 4
was 0 76 4
politically 0 76 4
motivated, 0 76 4
prompted 0 76 4
by 0 76 4
sensitivity 0 76 4
about 0 76 4
classified 0 76 4

amid 0 76 4

who 0 76 5
sought 0 76 5
out 0 76 5
punishment 0 76 5
to 0 76 5
Saucier 0 76 5
for 0 76 5
his 0 76 5

lenient 0 76 5
with 0 76 5
Hillary 0 76 5

“They 0 76 10

“but 1 76 10
they 1 76 10
didn’t 1 76 10
prosecute 1 76 10

Hillary 0 76 11
is 0 76 11
still 0 76 11
walking 0 76 11

Two 1 76 12

my 1 76 12
ship 1 76 12
did 1 76 12
the 1 76 12
same 1 76 12
thing 1 76 12
and 1 76 12
weren’t 1 76 12
treated 1 76 12
as 1 76 12
criminals. 1 76 12

We 0 76 13
want 0 76 13
them 0 76 13
to 0 76 13
correct 0 76 13
the 0 76 13
wrong.” 0 76 13
Daigle 0 76 13
said 0 76 13
that 0 76 13
a 0 76 13
notice 0 76 13
about 0 76 13
the 0 76 13
pending 0 76 13

included 0 76 13
in 0 76 13
it 0 76 13
in 0 76 13
December. 0 76 13

There 0 76 14
is 0 76 14
usually 0 76 14
a 0 76 14
six-month 0 76 14
period 0 76 14
that 0 76 14
must 0 76 14
elapse 0 76 14
before 0 76 14

lawsuit 0 76 14
actually 0 76 14
is 0 76 14
actually 0 76 14
filed. 0 76 14

“My 0 76 15
case 0 76 15
was 0 76 15
usually 0 76 15
something 0 76 15
handled 0 76 15
by 0 76 15
military 0 76 15
courts,” 0 76 15
he 0 76 15
said. 0 76 15

“They 1 76 16
used 1 76 16
me 1 76 16
as 1 76 16
an 1 76 16
example 1 76 16
because 1 76 16
of 1 76 16
[the 1 76 16
backlash 1 76 16
over] 1 76 16
Hillary 1 76 16
Clinton,” 1 76 16
he 0 76 16
continued, 0 76 16
alleging 0 76 16
his 0 76 16

“With 0 76 17
a 0 76 17

there’s 0 76 17
no 0 76 17
magic 0 76 17
wand 0 76 17
that 0 76 17
gets 0 76 17
waved 0 76 17

makes 0 76 17
everything 0 76 17
right,” 0 76 17

said, 0 76 17
“But 0 76 17
I 0 76 17
try 0 76 17
to 0 76 17
stay 0 76 17
positive 0 76 17

look 0 76 17
forward.” 0 76 17
Saucier 0 76 17
has 0 76 17
had 0 76 17
cars 0 76 17
repossessed 0 76 17
and 0 76 17
is 0 76 17
in 0 76 17
debt 0 76 17
due 0 76 17
to 0 76 17
the 0 76 17
loss 0 76 17
of 0 76 17
income 0 76 17
after 0 76 17
having 0 76 17
a 0 76 17
felony 0 76 17
on 0 76 17
his 0 76 17
record. 0 76 17

The 0 76 18
government 0 76 18
actively 1 76 18
destroyed 1 76 18
his 1 76 18
life 1 76 18
an 1 76 18
made 1 76 18
it 1 76 18
all 1 76 18
but 1 76 18
impossible 1 76 18
for 0 76 18
his 0 76 18
family 0 76 18
to 0 76 18
get 0 76 18
back 0 76 18
on 0 76 18
track. 0 76 18

But 0 76 19
Hillary 0 76 19
Clinton 0 76 19

running 0 76 19
around 0 76 19
free, 1 76 19
to 0 76 19
this 0 76 19
day. 0 76 19

And 0 76 20
that 0 76 20
is 0 76 20
what 0 76 20
Saucier 0 76 20
is 0 76 20
so 0 76 20
burnt 0 76 20
about, 0 76 20
with 1 76 20
good 1 76 20
reason. 1 76 20
