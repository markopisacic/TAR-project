in 0 91 14
Madagascar 0 91 14
has 0 91 14
been 0 91 14
released. 0 91 14

Officials 0 91 15
warn 0 91 15
that 0 91 15
it’s 0 91 15
inevitable 0 91 15
that 0 91 15
this 0 91 15
bacterial 0 91 15

that’s 0 91 15
infected 0 91 15
over 0 91 15
2000 0 91 15
people 1 91 15
will 1 91 15
become 1 91 15
resistant 1 91 15
to 1 91 15

The 0 91 16
only 0 91 16
way 0 91 16
to 0 91 16

a 0 91 16

who 0 91 16

contracted 0 91 16
the 0 91 16
plague 0 91 16
is 0 91 16
with 0 91 16
antibiotics. 0 91 16

But 0 91 17
experts 0 91 17
now 0 91 17
warn 0 91 17
that 0 91 17
because 0 91 17
they 0 91 17
are 0 91 17
being 0 91 17
used 0 91 17
so 0 91 17
much 0 91 17
to 0 91 17
treat 0 91 17
the 0 91 17
infection, 0 91 17
antibiotics 1 91 17
resistance 1 91 17
is 1 91 17
inevitable 1 91 17
and 0 91 17
making 0 91 17
this 0 91 17
disease 0 91 17
much 0 91 17
more 0 91 17
terrifying. 0 91 17

Once 1 91 18
the 1 91 18
bacteria 1 91 18
is 1 91 18
resistant, 1 91 18
the 0 91 18
Madagascar 0 91 18
healthcare 0 91 18
system 0 91 18
will 0 91 18
be 0 91 18
overwhelmed, 0 91 18
and 0 91 18
the 0 91 18
disease 0 91 18
will 0 91 18
have 0 91 18
control 0 91 18

nation. 0 91 18

As 0 91 19

noted, 0 91 19
should 0 91 19
the 0 91 19
disease 0 91 19
spread 0 91 19
to 0 91 19
the 0 91 19
African 0 91 19
mainland, 0 91 19
one 0 91 19
can 0 91 19
assume 0 91 19
that 0 91 19
it 0 91 19
will 0 91 19
be 0 91 19
all 0 91 19
but 0 91 19
impossible 0 91 19
to 0 91 19
control, 0 91 19
thus 0 91 19
increasing 1 91 19
