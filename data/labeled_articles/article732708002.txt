Pope 0
Francis' 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
hit 0
by 0
resignations 0
and 0
criticism, 0
gets 0
a 0
reboot 0

Last 0
week 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
announced 0
he 0
was 0
reviving 0
a 0
panel 0
he 0
created 0
to 0
advise 0
the 0
Vatican 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
handle 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy. 0

The 0
issue 0
has 0
dogged 0
the 0
Roman 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
in 0
recent 0
years, 0
and 0
critics 0
have 0
accused 0
Francis 0
and 0
his 0
two 0
predecessors, 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
of 0
failing 0
to 0
aggressively 0
weed 0
out 0
and 0
punish 0
predator 0
priests. 0

Here’s 0
a 0
look 0
what 0
drove 0
the 0
panel’s 0
creation 0
and 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

What 0
is 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
commission 0
on 0
sexual 0
abuse? 0

Following 0
criticism 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
focusing 0
on 0
halting 0
child 0
abuse 0
within 0
the 0
church, 0
Francis 0
created 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Commission 0
for 0
the 0
Protection 0
of 0
Minors 0
in 0
March 0
2014, 0
naming 0
Cardinal 0
Sean 0
O’Malley, 0
the 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Boston, 0
to 0
run 0
it. 0

O’Malley 0
was 0
not 0
only 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
“G9” 0
group 0
of 0
close 0
advisors; 0
he 0
was 0
also 0
the 0
man 0
who 0
sought 0
to 0
clean 0
up 0
the 0
abuse 0
scandal 0
in 0
Boston 0
after 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
his 0
predecessor, 0
Cardinal 0
Bernard 0
Law, 0
whose 0
shifting 0
of 0
predator 0
priests 0
to 0
new 0
posts 0
was 0
exposed 0
by 0
the 0
Boston 0
Globe 0
and 0
chronicled 0
in 0
the 0
movie 0
“Spotlight.” 0

The 0
revelations 0
about 0
Law, 0
who 0
died 0
in 0
December, 0
emboldened 0
abuse 0
victims 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
and 0
world, 0
who 0
began 0
speaking 0
up 0
about 0
the 0
priests 0
who 0
had 0
molested 0
them. 0

When 0
he 0
created 0
the 0
commission, 0
Francis 0
said: 0
“The 0
commission’s 0
specific 0
task 0
is 0
to 0
propose 0
to 0
me 0
the 0
most 0
opportune 0
initiatives 0
for 0
protecting 0
minors 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
adults, 0
in 0
order 0
that 0
we 0
may 0
do 0
everything 0
possible 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
crimes 0
such 0
as 0
those 0
which 0
have 0
occurred 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
repeated 0
in 0
the 0
Church.” 0

Why 0
is 0
it 0
being 0
renewed 0
now? 0

After 0
the 0
commission’s 0
three-year 0
mandate 0
expired 0
in 0
December, 0
Francis 0
relaunched 0
it 0
on 0
Feb. 0
17 0
with 0
some 0
members 0
reappointed 0
and 0
nine 0
new 0
members 0
added, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
are 0
victims 0
of 0
abuse, 0
although 0
the 0
Vatican 0
declined 0
to 0
say 0
which, 0
opting 0
to 0
respect 0
their 0
privacy. 0

O’Malley 0
returns 0
as 0
chief. 0

New 0
members 0
come 0
from 0
Australia, 0
Brazil, 0
Ethiopia, 0
India, 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
and 0
Tonga, 0
"reflecting 0
the 0
global 0
reach 0
of 0
the 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
challenge 0
of 0
creating 0
safeguarding 0
structures 0
in 0
diverse 0
cultural 0
context,” 0
the 0
Vatican 0
said. 0

What 0
did 0
the 0
first 0
commission 0
achieve? 0

The 0
Vatican 0
has 0
said 0
it 0
“worked 0
with 0
almost 0
200 0
dioceses 0
and 0
religious 0
communities 0
worldwide 0
to 0
raise 0
awareness 0
and 0
to 0
educate 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
safeguarding 0
in 0
our 0
homes, 0
parishes, 0
schools, 0
hospitals, 0
and 0
other 0
institutions.” 0

What 0
didn’t 0
it 0
do? 0

Commission 0
members 0
quickly 0
realized 0
they 0
needed 0
to 0
go 0
beyond 0
raising 0
awareness 0
and 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
bishops 0
who 0
quietly 0
shift 0
offenders 0
to 0
new 0
dioceses 0
when 0
they 0
are 0
exposed 0
as 0
molesters 0
and 0
rapists. 0

Even 0
if 0
church 0
laws 0
already 0
existed 0
to 0
hold 0
bishops 0
accountable 0
for 0
their 0
priests’ 0
behavior, 0
those 0
strictures 0
were 0
not 0
enough, 0
O’Malley 0
said 0
in 0
2014. 0

“There 0
are, 0
theoretically 0
I 0
guess, 0
canons 0
that 0
could 0
apply 0
here, 0
but 0
obviously 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
been 0
sufficient,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
commission 0
was 0
behind 0
Francis’ 0
decision 0
in 0
2015 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
new 0
tribunal 0
to 0
judge 0
bishops 0
caught 0
covering 0
up 0
for 0
abusive 1
priests, 1
and 0
to 0
fund 0
it 0
for 0
five 0
years. 0

But 0
amid 0
myriad 0
legal 0
questions 0
over 0
what 0
exact 0
powers 0
the 0
court 0
would 0
have, 0
it 0
never 0
got 0
off 0
the 0
ground. 0

In 0
2016, 0
Francis 0
officially 0
killed 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
create 0
it, 0
issuing 0
a 0
document 0
that 0
essentially 0
called 0
on 0
using 0
existing 0
procedures 0
to 0
tackle 0
the 0
problem. 0

Francis 0
was 0
also 0
criticized 0
when 0
Australian 0
Cardinal 0
George 0
Pell, 0
whom 0
he 0
had 0
brought 0
to 0
Rome 0
to 0
clean 0
up 0
Vatican 0
finances, 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
return 0
to 0
Australia 0
last 0
year 0
to 0
face 0
charges 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

Any 0
other 0
problems? 0

Commission 0
members 0
said 0
bishops 0
should 0
call 0
the 0
police 0
when 0
they 0
discovered 0
predator 1
priests, 1
rather 0
than 0
phone 0
the 0
nearest 0
religious 0
retreat 0
to 0
“park” 1
the 1
priest 1
out 1
of 1
harm’s 1
way. 1

But 0
this 0
simple 0
message 0
was 0
hard 0
to 0
get 0
across. 0

It 0
emerged 0
that 0
during 0
a 0
Vatican 0
training 0
course 0
for 0
new 0
bishops 0
in 0
September 0
2015 0
a 0
French 0
priest 0
informed 0
bishops 0
they 0
had 0
no 0
obligation 0
to 0
report 0
abuse 0
to 0
the 0
police, 0
forcing 0
the 0
commission 0
to 0
issue 0
a 0
strong 0
statement 0
saying 0
bishops 0
had 0
every 0
obligation 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Did 0
commission 0
members 0
persevere? 0

Not 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

British 0
member 0
Peter 0
Saunders, 0
a 0
former 0
victim 0
of 0
priestly 0
abuse, 0
was 0
ousted 0
in 0
2016. 0

He 0
said 0
the 0
group 0
was 0
a 0
toothless, 1
paper-shuffling 1
exercise. 1

Irish 0
member 0
Marie 0
Collins, 0
another 0
victim, 0
resigned 0
in 0
March 0
last 0
year 0
and 0
said 0
Vatican 0
bureaucrats 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
comply 0
with 0
the 0
commission’s 0
request 0
— 0
approved 0
by 0
the 0
pope 0
— 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
all 0
letters 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
by 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

Marie 0
Collins, 0
then 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
pope's 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
in 0
2015 0
hands 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Sean 0
O'Malley 0
detailing 0
the 0
abuse 0
suffered 0
by 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz 0
of 0
Chile. 0

Catherine 0
Bonnet 0
/ 0
Associated 0
Press 0

Was 0
the 0
pope 0
listening 0
to 0
the 0
commission? 0

Possibly 0
not. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Collins 0
handed 0
O’Malley 0
a 0
letter 0
addressed 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
from 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
a 0
Chilean 0
abused 0
as 0
a 0
boy 0
by 0
Chilean 0
prelate 0
Fernando 0
Karadima, 0
who 0
was 0
sentenced 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
to 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
penance 0
in 0
2010. 0

Cruz 0
described 0
how 0
the 0
abuse 0
was 0
witnessed 0
and 0
covered 0
up 0
by 0
Juan 0
Barros, 0
a 0
priest 0
whose 0
appointment 0
as 0
a 0
bishop 0
in 0
2015 0
prompted 0
huge 0
protests 0
in 0
Chile. 0

The 0
pope 0
has 0
stuck 0
by 0
Barros, 0
dismissing 0
the 0
protesters 0
as 0
“lefties” 1
and 0
hugging 0
Barros 0
publicly 0
during 0
his 0
visit 0
to 0
Chile 0
last 0
month. 0

"I 0
can't 0
condemn 0
[Barros] 0
because 0
I 0
don't 0
have 0
evidence," 0
he 0
said 0
on 0
the 0
plane 0
back 0
to 0
Rome, 0
suggesting 0
he 0
had 0
ignored 0
or 0
never 0
read 0
the 0
letter 0
from 0
Cruz. 0

That 0
was 0
too 0
much 0
for 0
O’Malley, 0
who 0
said 0
Francis 0
had 1
caused 1
"great 1
pain” 1
to 1
victims. 1

If 1
Francis 1
was 1
not 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
commission 1
about 1
Barros, 1
whom 1
was 1
he 1
listening 1
to? 1

Vatican 0
watchers 0
believe 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
influenced 0
by 0
Chilean 0
Cardinal 0
Francisco 0
Javier 0
Errazuriz, 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
G9 0
group 0
who 0
has 0
backed 0
Barros 0
and 0
reportedly 0
helped 0
block 0
moves 0
to 0
make 0
Cruz 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission. 0

So 0
is 0
the 0
pope 0
intransigent 0
on 0
Barros? 0

No. 0

Something 0
changed 0
his 0
mind 0
after 0
his 0
Chilean 0
trip, 0
possibly 0
the 0
scale 0
of 0
the 0
protest 0
against 0
Barros 0
in 0
the 0
country. 0

On 0
Feb. 0
17, 0
he 0
sent 0
a 0
senior 0
Vatican 0
sex 0
abuse 0
investigator, 0
Archbishop 0
Charles 0
Scicluna, 0
to 0
New 0
York 0
to 0
interview 0
Cruz, 0
who 0
now 0
lives 0
in 0
Philadelphia. 0

"For 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
felt 0
that 0
someone 0
is 0
listening," 0
Cruz 0
said 0
after 0
the 0
meeting. 0

What 0
happens 0
next? 0

“This 0
should 0
lead 0
to 0
Barros 0
stepping 0
down,” 0
said 0
Saunders, 0
who 0
is 0
forming 0
his 0
own 0
campaign 0
group 0
with 0
Cruz 0
and 0
others 0
to 0
fight 0
clerical 0
abuse. 0

The 0
new 0
papal 0
commission 0
will 0
meanwhile 0
hold 0
its 0
first 0
meeting 0
in 0
April. 0
