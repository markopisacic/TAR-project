Archbishop 0 371 1

has 0 371 1
released 0 371 1
a 0 371 1
new, 0 371 1
powerful 0 371 1
statement 0 371 1

for 0 371 2
the 0 371 2
following 0 371 2
translation 0 371 2
and 0 371 2
release 0 371 2
of 0 371 2
the 0 371 2
follow-up 0 371 2
testimony 0 371 2
from 0 371 2
arguably 0 371 2
the 1 371 2
most 1 371 2
courageous 1 371 2
prelate 1 371 2
in 1 371 2
the 1 371 2
Church 1 371 2
today—Archbishop 1 371 2
Carlo 1 371 2
Maria 1 371 2
Viganò. 1 371 2

The 0 371 3
former 0 371 3
Apostolic 0 371 3
Nuncio 0 371 3
to 0 371 3
the 0 371 3
United 0 371 3
States 0 371 3
has, 0 371 3
as 0 371 3
they 0 371 3
say, 0 371 3
doubled 0 371 3
down. 0 371 3

Far 0 371 4
from 0 371 4
backing-away 0 371 4
and 0 371 4
making 0 371 4
excuses 0 371 4
for 0 371 4
his 0 371 4
early 0 371 4
actions, 0 371 4
as 0 371 4
we’ve 0 371 4
all 0 371 4
become 0 371 4
so 0 371 4
accustomed 0 371 4
to 0 371 4
seeing 0 371 4
in 0 371 4
these 0 371 4
rare 0 371 4
cases 0 371 4
where 0 371 4
a 0 371 4
hierarch 0 371 4
breaks 0 371 4
ranks, 0 371 4
Archbishop 0 371 4
Viganò 0 371 4
is 0 371 4
digging 0 371 4
in 0 371 4
with 0 371 4
a 1 371 4
4-page 1 371 4
bombshell 1 371 4
that 0 371 4
restates 0 371 4
his 0 371 4
initial 0 371 4
accusations 0 371 4
of 0 371 4
abuse 0 371 4
cover-up 0 371 4
against 0 371 4
Francis 0 371 4
and 0 371 4
other 0 371 4
powerful 0 371 4
members 0 371 4
of 0 371 4
the 0 371 4
hierarchy, 0 371 4
and 0 371 4
even 0 371 4
concludes 0 371 4
with 0 371 4
a 0 371 4
suggestion 0 371 4
that 0 371 4
Francis 0 371 4
is 0 371 4
beginning 0 371 4
to 0 371 4
act 0 371 4
as 0 371 4
a 1 371 4
“substitute 1 371 4
of 1 371 4
our 1 371 4
Lord.” 1 371 4

Read 0 371 5
the 0 371 5
Archbishop’s 0 371 5
words 0 371 5
for 0 371 5
yourselves 0 371 5
and 0 371 5
note 0 371 5
well 0 371 5
the 0 371 5
ring 0 371 5
of 0 371 5
truth 0 371 5
that 0 371 5
resonates 0 371 5
in 0 371 5
every 0 371 5
sentence. 0 371 5

This 1 371 6
is 1 371 6
clearly 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
testimony 1 371 6
of 1 371 6
an 1 371 6
honest 1 371 6
man 1 371 6
who 1 371 6
has 1 371 6
only 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
good 1 371 6
of 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
Church 1 371 6
in 1 371 6
his 1 371 6
heart—a 1 371 6
modern-day 1 371 6
Athanasius 1 371 6
standing 1 371 6
against 1 371 6
something 1 371 6
so 1 371 6
much 1 371 6
worse 1 371 6
than 1 371 6
Liberius. 1 371 6

Friends, 0 371 7
let 0 371 7
us 0 371 7
pray 0 371 7
for 0 371 7
Archbishop 0 371 7
Viganò. 0 371 7

He 0 371 8
is 0 371 8
standing 0 371 8
alone 0 371 8
now, 0 371 8
and 0 371 8
not 0 371 8
only 0 371 8
against 0 371 8
the 1 371 8
most 1 371 8
dangerous 1 371 8
pontificate 1 371 8
in 1 371 8
history, 1 371 8
but 0 371 8
also 0 371 8
the 1 371 8
forces 1 371 8
of 1 371 8
hell 1 371 8
itself—forces 0 371 8
which 0 371 8
will 0 371 8
do 0 371 8
all 0 371 8
in 0 371 8
their 0 371 8
power 0 371 8
to 0 371 8
silence 0 371 8
this 0 371 8
voice 1 371 8
crying 1 371 8
in 1 371 8
the 1 371 8
wilderness. 1 371 8

Make 0 371 9
no 0 371 9
mistake 0 371 9
about 0 371 9
this: 0 371 9
Archbishop 1 371 9
Viganò 1 371 9
is 1 371 9
fighting 1 371 9
for 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
very 1 371 9
survival 1 371 9
of 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
human 1 371 9
element 1 371 9
of 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
Catholic 1 371 9
Church. 1 371 9

He 0 371 10
is 0 371 10
standing 0 371 10
against 0 371 10
corrupt 0 371 10
men 0 371 10
in 0 371 10
high 0 371 10
places 0 371 10
who 0 371 10
cannot 0 371 10
be 0 371 10
trusted 0 371 10
to 0 371 10
do 0 371 10
what 0 371 10
is 0 371 10
best 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
souls, 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
the 0 371 10
Catholic 0 371 10
faithful 0 371 10
or 0 371 10
indeed 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
Holy 0 371 10
Mother 0 371 10
Church 0 371 10
herself. 0 371 10

The 1 371 11
enemy 1 371 11
is 1 371 11
not 1 371 11
only 1 371 11
at 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
gates 1 371 11
but 1 371 11
has 1 371 11
now 1 371 11
made 1 371 11
their 1 371 11
way 1 371 11
to 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
thrones 1 371 11
of 1 371 11
power 1 371 11
and 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
seats 1 371 11
of 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
Apostles. 1 371 11

God 1 371 12
help 1 371 12
us. 1 371 12

It 0 371 13
goes 0 371 13
without 0 371 13
saying 0 371 13
that 0 371 13
we 0 371 13
here 0 371 13
at 0 371 13
The 0 371 13
Remnant 0 371 13
not 0 371 13
only 0 371 13
stand 0 371 13
with 0 371 13
Viganò 0 371 13
but 0 371 13
we 0 371 13
thank 0 371 13
God 0 371 13
for 0 371 13
him 0 371 13
every 0 371 13
day, 0 371 13
we 0 371 13
pray 0 371 13
the 0 371 13
Rosary 0 371 13
for 0 371 13
him 0 371 13
every 0 371 13
day, 0 371 13
and 0 371 13
wish 1 371 13
him 1 371 13
every 1 371 13
blessing 1 371 13
and 1 371 13
heavenly 1 371 13
consolation 1 371 13
as 1 371 13
he 1 371 13
undergoes 1 371 13
this 1 371 13
passion 1 371 13
for 1 371 13
the 1 371 13
sake 1 371 13
of 1 371 13
the 1 371 13
Master 1 371 13
he 1 371 13
serves 1 371 13
so 1 371 13
well. 1 371 13

God 0 371 14
bless 0 371 14
you, 0 371 14
Your 0 371 14
Excellency, 0 371 14
and 0 371 14
Mary 0 371 14
keep 0 371 14
you. 0 371 14

We 0 371 15

with 0 371 15
you! 0 371 15

that 1 371 34

reflection 0 371 35

vocations 1 371 35
and 1 371 35
lives 1 371 35
of 1 371 35
young 1 371 35
priests 1 371 35
and 1 371 35
religious 1 371 35
disturbed. 1 371 35

The 0 371 36
silence 0 371 36
of 0 371 36
the 0 371 36
pastors 0 371 36
who 0 371 36
could 0 371 36
have 0 371 36
provided 0 371 36
a 0 371 36
remedy 0 371 36
and 0 371 36
prevented 0 371 36
new 0 371 36
victims 0 371 36
became 0 371 36
increasingly 0 371 36
indefensible, 0 371 36
a 1 371 36
devastating 1 371 36
crime 1 371 36
for 1 371 36
the 1 371 36
Church. 1 371 36

Well 0 371 37
aware 0 371 37
of 0 371 37
the 0 371 37
enormous 0 371 37
consequences 0 371 37
that 0 371 37
my 0 371 37
testimony 0 371 37
could 0 371 37
have, 0 371 37
because 0 371 37
what 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
was 0 371 37
about 0 371 37
to 0 371 37
reveal 0 371 37
involved 0 371 37
the 0 371 37
successor 0 371 37
of 0 371 37
Peter 0 371 37
himself, 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
nonetheless 0 371 37
chose 0 371 37
to 0 371 37
speak 0 371 37
in 0 371 37
order 0 371 37
to 0 371 37
protect 0 371 37
the 0 371 37
Church, 0 371 37
and 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
declare 0 371 37
with 0 371 37
a 0 371 37
clear 0 371 37
conscience 0 371 37
before 0 371 37
God 0 371 37
that 0 371 37
my 0 371 37
testimony 0 371 37
is 0 371 37
true. 0 371 37

Christ 0 371 38
died 0 371 38
for 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
Church, 0 371 38
and 0 371 38
Peter, 0 371 38
Servus 0 371 38
servorum 0 371 38
Dei, 0 371 38
is 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
first 0 371 38
one 0 371 38
called 0 371 38
to 0 371 38
serve 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
spouse 0 371 38
of 0 371 38
Christ. 0 371 38

Certainly, 0 371 39
some 0 371 39
of 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
facts 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
was 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
reveal 0 371 39
were 0 371 39
covered 0 371 39
by 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
pontifical 0 371 39
secret 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
had 0 371 39
promised 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
observe 0 371 39
and 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
had 0 371 39
faithfully 0 371 39
observed 0 371 39
from 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
beginning 0 371 39
of 0 371 39
my 0 371 39
service 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
Holy 0 371 39
See. 0 371 39

But 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
purpose 0 371 40
of 0 371 40
any 0 371 40
secret, 0 371 40
including 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
pontifical 0 371 40
secret, 0 371 40
is 0 371 40
to 0 371 40
protect 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
Church 0 371 40
from 0 371 40
her 0 371 40
enemies, 0 371 40
not 0 371 40
to 0 371 40
cover 0 371 40
up 0 371 40
and 0 371 40
become 0 371 40
complicit 0 371 40
in 0 371 40
crimes 0 371 40
committed 0 371 40
by 0 371 40
some 0 371 40
of 0 371 40
her 0 371 40
members. 0 371 40

I 0 371 41
was 0 371 41
a 0 371 41
witness, 0 371 41
not 0 371 41
by 0 371 41
my 0 371 41
choice, 0 371 41
of 0 371 41
shocking 1 371 41
facts 1 371 41
and, 0 371 41
as 0 371 41
the 0 371 41
Catechism 0 371 41
of 0 371 41
the 0 371 41
Catholic 0 371 41
Church 0 371 41
states 0 371 41
(par. 0 371 41

2491), 0 371 42
the 0 371 42
seal 0 371 42
of 0 371 42
secrecy 0 371 42
is 0 371 42
not 0 371 42
binding 0 371 42
when 0 371 42
very 0 371 42
grave 0 371 42
harm 0 371 42
can 0 371 42
be 0 371 42
avoided 0 371 42
only 0 371 42
by 0 371 42
divulging 0 371 42
the 0 371 42
truth. 0 371 42

Only 0 371 43
the 0 371 43
seal 0 371 43
of 0 371 43
confession 0 371 43
could 0 371 43
have 0 371 43
justified 0 371 43
my 0 371 43
silence. 0 371 43

Neither 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
pope, 0 371 44
nor 0 371 44
any 0 371 44
of 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
cardinals 0 371 44
in 0 371 44
Rome 0 371 44
have 0 371 44
denied 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
facts 0 371 44
I 0 371 44
asserted 0 371 44
in 0 371 44
my 0 371 44
testimony. 0 371 44

“Qui 0 371 45
tacet 0 371 45
consentit” 0 371 45
surely 0 371 45
applies 0 371 45
here, 0 371 45
for 0 371 45
if 0 371 45
they 0 371 45
deny 0 371 45
my 0 371 45
testimony, 0 371 45
they 0 371 45
have 0 371 45
only 0 371 45
to 0 371 45
say 0 371 45
so, 0 371 45
and 0 371 45
provide 0 371 45
documentation 0 371 45
to 0 371 45
support 0 371 45
that 0 371 45
denial. 0 371 45

How 1 371 46
can 1 371 46
one 1 371 46
avoid 1 371 46
concluding 1 371 46
that 1 371 46
the 1 371 46
reason 1 371 46
they 1 371 46
do 1 371 46
not 1 371 46
provide 1 371 46
the 1 371 46
documentation 1 371 46
is 1 371 46
that 1 371 46
they 1 371 46
know 1 371 46
it 1 371 46
confirms 1 371 46
my 1 371 46
testimony? 1 371 46

The 0 371 47
center 0 371 47
of 0 371 47
my 0 371 47
testimony 0 371 47
was 0 371 47
that 0 371 47
since 0 371 47
at 0 371 47
least 0 371 47
June 0 371 47
23, 0 371 47
2013, 0 371 47
the 0 371 47
pope 0 371 47
knew 0 371 47
from 0 371 47
me 0 371 47
how 1 371 47
perverse 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
evil 1 371 47
McCarrick 0 371 47
was 0 371 47
in 0 371 47
his 0 371 47
intentions 0 371 47
and 0 371 47
actions, 0 371 47
and 0 371 47
instead 1 371 47
of 1 371 47
taking 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
measures 1 371 47
that 1 371 47
every 1 371 47
good 1 371 47
pastor 1 371 47
would 1 371 47
have 1 371 47
taken, 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
pope 1 371 47
made 1 371 47
McCarrick 1 371 47
one 1 371 47
of 1 371 47
his 1 371 47
principal 1 371 47
agents 1 371 47
in 1 371 47
governing 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
Church, 1 371 47
in 1 371 47
regard 1 371 47
to 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
United 1 371 47
States, 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
Curia, 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
even 1 371 47
China, 1 371 47
as 1 371 47
we 1 371 47
are 1 371 47
seeing 1 371 47
these 1 371 47
days 1 371 47
with 1 371 47
great 1 371 47
concern 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
anxiety 1 371 47
for 1 371 47
that 1 371 47
martyr 1 371 47
Church. 1 371 47

Now, 1 371 48
the 1 371 48
pope’s 1 371 48
reply 1 371 48
to 1 371 48
my 1 371 48
testimony 1 371 48
was: 1 371 48
“I 1 371 48
will 1 371 48
not 1 371 48
say 1 371 48
a 1 371 48
word!” 1 371 48
But 1 371 48
then, 1 371 48
contradicting 1 371 48
himself, 1 371 48
he 1 371 48
has 1 371 48
compared 1 371 48
his 1 371 48
silence 1 371 48
to 1 371 48
that 1 371 48
of 1 371 48
Jesus 1 371 48
in 1 371 48
Nazareth 1 371 48
and 1 371 48
before 1 371 48
Pilate, 1 371 48
and 0 371 48
compared 0 371 48
me 0 371 48
to 0 371 48
the 1 371 48
great 1 371 48
accuser, 1 371 48
Satan, 1 371 48
who 1 371 48
sows 1 371 48
scandal 1 371 48
and 1 371 48
division 1 371 48
in 1 371 48
the 1 371 48
Church 1 371 48
— 0 371 48
though 0 371 48
without 0 371 48
ever 0 371 48
uttering 0 371 48
my 0 371 48
name. 0 371 48

If 0 371 49
he 0 371 49
had 0 371 49
said: 0 371 49
“Viganò 0 371 49
lied,” 0 371 49
he 0 371 49
would 0 371 49
have 0 371 49
challenged 0 371 49
my 0 371 49
credibility 0 371 49
while 0 371 49
trying 0 371 49
to 0 371 49
affirm 0 371 49
his 0 371 49
own. 0 371 49

In 0 371 50
so 0 371 50
doing 0 371 50
he 0 371 50
would 0 371 50
have 0 371 50
intensified 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
demand 0 371 50
of 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
people 0 371 50
of 0 371 50
God 0 371 50
and 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
world 0 371 50
for 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
documentation 0 371 50
needed 0 371 50
to 0 371 50
determine 0 371 50
who 0 371 50
has 0 371 50
told 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
truth. 0 371 50

Instead, 0 371 51
he 0 371 51
put 0 371 51
in 0 371 51
place 0 371 51
a 0 371 51
subtle 0 371 51
slander 0 371 51
against 0 371 51
me 0 371 51
— 0 371 51
slander 0 371 51
being 0 371 51
an 0 371 51
offense 0 371 51
he 0 371 51
has 0 371 51
often 0 371 51
compared 0 371 51
to 0 371 51
the 0 371 51
gravity 0 371 51
of 0 371 51
murder. 0 371 51

Indeed, 0 371 52
he 0 371 52
did 0 371 52
it 0 371 52
repeatedly, 0 371 52
in 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
context 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
celebration 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
most 0 371 52
Holy 0 371 52
Sacrament, 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
Eucharist, 0 371 52
where 0 371 52
he 0 371 52
runs 0 371 52
no 0 371 52
risk 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
being 0 371 52
challenged 0 371 52
by 0 371 52
journalists. 0 371 52

When 0 371 53
he 0 371 53
did 0 371 53
speak 0 371 53
to 0 371 53
journalists, 0 371 53
he 0 371 53
asked 0 371 53
them 0 371 53
to 0 371 53
exercise 0 371 53
their 0 371 53
professional 0 371 53
maturity 0 371 53
and 0 371 53
draw 0 371 53
their 0 371 53
own 0 371 53
conclusions. 0 371 53

But 1 371 54
how 1 371 54
can 1 371 54
journalists 1 371 54
discover 1 371 54
and 1 371 54
know 1 371 54
the 1 371 54
truth 1 371 54
if 1 371 54
those 1 371 54
directly 1 371 54
involved 1 371 54
with 1 371 54
a 1 371 54
matter 1 371 54
refuse 1 371 54
to 1 371 54
answer 1 371 54
any 1 371 54
questions 1 371 54
or 1 371 54
to 1 371 54
release 1 371 54
any 1 371 54
documents? 1 371 54

The 1 371 55
pope’s 1 371 55
unwillingness 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
respond 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
my 1 371 55
charges 1 371 55
and 1 371 55
his 1 371 55
deafness 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
the 1 371 55
appeals 1 371 55
by 1 371 55
the 1 371 55
faithful 1 371 55
for 1 371 55
accountability 1 371 55
are 1 371 55
hardly 1 371 55
consistent 1 371 55
with 1 371 55
his 1 371 55
calls 1 371 55
for 1 371 55
transparency 1 371 55
and 1 371 55
bridge 1 371 55
building. 1 371 55

Moreover, 0 371 56
the 0 371 56
pope’s 0 371 56
cover-up 0 371 56
of 0 371 56
McCarrick 0 371 56
was 0 371 56
clearly 0 371 56
not 0 371 56
an 0 371 56
isolated 0 371 56
mistake. 0 371 56

Many 1 371 57
more 1 371 57
instances 1 371 57
have 1 371 57
recently 1 371 57
been 1 371 57
documented 1 371 57
in 1 371 57
the 1 371 57
press, 1 371 57
showing 1 371 57
that 1 371 57
Pope 1 371 57
Francis 1 371 57
has 1 371 57
defended 1 371 57
homosexual 1 371 57
clergy 1 371 57
who 1 371 57
committed 1 371 57
serious 1 371 57
sexual 1 371 57
abuses 1 371 57
against 1 371 57
minors 1 371 57
or 1 371 57
adults. 1 371 57

These 0 371 58
include 0 371 58
his 0 371 58
role 0 371 58
in 0 371 58
the 0 371 58
case 0 371 58
of 0 371 58
Fr. 0 371 58

Julio 0 371 59
Grassi 0 371 59
in 0 371 59
Buenos 0 371 59
Aires, 0 371 59
his 0 371 59
reinstatement 0 371 59
of 0 371 59
Fr. 0 371 59

Mauro 0 371 60
Inzoli 0 371 60
after 0 371 60
Pope 0 371 60
Benedict 0 371 60
had 0 371 60
removed 0 371 60
him 0 371 60
from 0 371 60
ministry 0 371 60
(until 0 371 60

In 0 371 61

a 0 371 61

of 0 371 61
the 0 371 61

Rome 0 371 61
asking 0 371 61
for 0 371 61
a 0 371 61

Cardinal 0 371 62
DiNardo 0 371 62
and 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
other 0 371 62
prelates 0 371 62

the 0 371 62

in 0 371 62
America 0 371 62
and 0 371 62
in 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
world: 0 371 62
did 1 371 62
the 1 371 62
pope 1 371 62
refuse 1 371 62
to 1 371 62
carry 1 371 62

those 1 371 62
responsible 1 371 62
for 1 371 62
covering 1 371 62
them 1 371 62
up? 1 371 62

The 1 371 63
faithful 1 371 63
deserve 1 371 63
to 1 371 63
know. 1 371 63

I 0 371 64
would 0 371 64
like 0 371 64
to 0 371 64
make 0 371 64
a 0 371 64
special 0 371 64
appeal 0 371 64
to 0 371 64
Cardinal 0 371 64
Ouellet, 0 371 64
because 0 371 64
as 0 371 64
nuncio 0 371 64
I 0 371 64
always 0 371 64
worked 0 371 64
in 0 371 64
great 0 371 64
harmony 0 371 64
with 0 371 64
him, 0 371 64
and 0 371 64
I 0 371 64
have 0 371 64
always 0 371 64
had 0 371 64
great 0 371 64
esteem 0 371 64
and 0 371 64
affection 0 371 64
towards 0 371 64
him. 0 371 64

He 0 371 65
will 0 371 65
remember 0 371 65
when, 0 371 65
at 0 371 65
the 0 371 65
end 0 371 65
of 0 371 65
my 0 371 65
mission 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
Washington, 0 371 65
he 0 371 65
received 0 371 65
me 0 371 65
at 0 371 65
his 0 371 65
apartment 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
Rome 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
the 0 371 65
evening 0 371 65
for 0 371 65
a 0 371 65
long 0 371 65
conversation. 0 371 65

At 0 371 66
the 0 371 66
beginning 0 371 66
of 0 371 66
Pope 0 371 66
Francis’ 0 371 66
pontificate, 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
had 0 371 66
maintained 0 371 66
his 0 371 66
dignity, 0 371 66
as 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
had 0 371 66
shown 0 371 66
with 0 371 66
courage 0 371 66
when 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
was 0 371 66
Archbishop 0 371 66
of 0 371 66
Québec. 0 371 66

Later, 0 371 67
however, 0 371 67
when 0 371 67
his 0 371 67
work 0 371 67
as 0 371 67
prefect 0 371 67
of 0 371 67
the 0 371 67
Congregation 0 371 67
for 0 371 67
Bishops 0 371 67
was 0 371 67
being 0 371 67
undermined 0 371 67
because 0 371 67
recommendations 0 371 67
for 0 371 67
episcopal 0 371 67
appointments 0 371 67
were 0 371 67
being 0 371 67
passed 0 371 67
directly 0 371 67
to 0 371 67
Pope 0 371 67
Francis 0 371 67
by 0 371 67
two 1 371 67
homosexual 1 371 67
“friends” 1 371 67
of 1 371 67
his 1 371 67
dicastery, 1 371 67
bypassing 0 371 67
the 0 371 67
Cardinal, 0 371 67
he 0 371 67
gave 0 371 67
up. 0 371 67

His 1 371 68
long 1 371 68
article 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
L’Osservatore 1 371 68
Romano, 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
which 1 371 68
he 1 371 68
came 1 371 68
out 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
favor 1 371 68
of 1 371 68
the 1 371 68
more 1 371 68
controversial 1 371 68
aspects 1 371 68
of 1 371 68
Amoris 1 371 68
Laetitia, 1 371 68

his 1 371 68
surrender. 1 371 68

Your 0 371 69

I 0 371 69

me 0 371 69
of 0 371 69
Pope 0 371 69
Benedict’s 0 371 69
sanctions 0 371 69
on 0 371 69
McCarrick. 0 371 69

key 0 371 70
documents 0 371 70
incriminating 0 371 70
McCarrick 0 371 70
and 0 371 70
many 0 371 70
in 0 371 70
the 0 371 70
curia 0 371 70
for 0 371 70
their 0 371 70
cover-ups. 0 371 70

Your 0 371 71
Eminence, 0 371 71
I 0 371 71
urge 0 371 71
you 0 371 71

despondent! 0 371 73

Make 1 371 74
