that 0

Dr. 0
Zafar 0

who 0
is 0

former 0

intelligence 0
agency, 0
and 0
that 0
Imran 0
claimed 0
his 1
IT 1

On 0
July 0
25, 0
2016, 0
the 0
House 0
Inspector 0
General 0
notified 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
House 0
Administration 0
that 0
investigators 0
had 0
detected 0
major 0
cybersecurity 0
violations 0
by 0
the 0
Awan 0
family. 0

Awan, 0
his 0
wife, 0
two 0
brothers, 0
his 0
brother’s 0
wife, 0
and 0
even 0
his 0
elderly 0
father 0
were 0
all 0
being 0
paid 0
by 0
various 0
Democrats 0
to 0
manage 0
their 0
servers, 0
with 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
members 0
from 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz’s 0
Florida. 0

The 0
finding 0
came 0
at 0
a 0
critical 0
time 0
for 0
Democrats: 0
It 0
was 0
three 0
days 0
after 0
WikiLeaks 0
published 0
the 0
first 0
emails 0
from 0
a 0
hacked 0
on 0
the 0
DNC, 0
setting 0
the 0
stage 0
for 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
to 0
lose 0
her 0
position 0
as 0
party 0
chair 0
and 0
for 0
Democrats 0
to 0
begin 0
electioneering 0
on 0
a 0
theme 0
of 0
Russian 0
hacking. 0

In 0
February 0
2017, 0
Kiko 0
and 0
the 0
House’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
official, 0
Paul 0
Irving, 0
outlined 0
serious 0
violations 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
committee, 0
and 0
the 0
family 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
the 0
House 0
computer 0
network. 0

The 0
letter 0
also 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
House 0
Democratic 0
Caucus 0
server 0
disappeared 0
soon 0
after 0
the 0
IG 0
report 0
named 0
it 0
as 0
key 0
evidence. 0

But 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
Awan, 0
with 0
her 0
spokesman 0
saying 0
he 0
would 0
work 0
on 0
“websites” 0
and 0
“printers,” 0
which 0
a 0
cybersecurity 0
expert 0
previously 0
told 0
TheDCNF 0
would 0
presumably 0
involve 0
network 0
access. 0

The 0
congresswoman 0
also 0
added 0
Awan’s 0
wife, 0
Hina 0
Alvi, 0
to 0
her 0
payroll 0
in 0
late 0
2016, 0
after 0
the 0
investigation 0
was 0
in 0
full 0
swing, 0
but 0
before 0
the 0
family 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
the 0
network. 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
kept 0
paying 0
her 0
until 0
March 0
17 0
— 0
12 0
days 0
after 0
Alvi 0
went 0
to 0
Pakistan 0
with 0
$12,000 0
in 0
a 0
suitcase. 0

Her 0
actions 0
so 1
rattled 1
the 0
Administration 0
Committee’s 0
Democratic 0
staff 0
director, 0
Jamie 0
Fleet, 0
that 0
he 0
planted 0
a 0
negative 0
story 0
in 0
Politico 0
that 0
revealed 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz, 0
his 0
fellow 0
Democrat, 0
was 0
continuing 0
to 0
pay 0
the 0
suspect, 0
two 0
House 0
sources 0
said. 0

The 0
story 0
also 0
said 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
had 0
a 0
“friendly 0
personal 0
relationship” 0
with 0
Awan 0
and 0
Alvi. 0

Fleet 0
did 0
not 0
respond 0
to 0
a 0
request 0
for 0
comment. 0

Kiko 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
April 0
2018 0
hearing 0
spurred 0
by 0
the 0
scandal 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
powerless 0
to 0
stop 0
members 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
a 1
bad 1
actor. 1

“Termination, 0
now 0
it’s 0
the 0
member’s 0
responsibility 0
… 0
We 0
can 0
revoke 0
everything 0
but 0
they 0
could 0
still 0
be 0
employed,” 0
he 0
said. 0

He 0
added 0
that 0
his 0
office 0
should 0
have 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
override 0
members 0
who 0
would 0
want 0
to 0
keep 0
a 1
rule-breaker 1
on 0
the 0
government 0
network. 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
became 0
fixated 0
on 0
finding 0
out 0
everything 0
investigators 0
knew 0
about 0
Awan, 0
the 0
House 0
sources 0
said. 0

House 0
investigators 0
briefed 0
her 0
extensively 0
with 0
significant 0
evidence 0
about 0
Awan 0
and 0
his 0
family, 0
including 0
improper 0
computer 0
evidence. 0

Yet 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement, 0
“my 0
office 0
was 0
provided 0
no 0
evidence 0
to 0
indicate 0
that 0
laws 0
had 0
been 0
broken, 0
which 0
over 0
time, 0
raised 0
troubling 0
concerns 0
about 0
due 0
process, 0
fair 0
treatment 0
and 0
potential 0
ethnic 0
and 0
religious 0
profiling.” 0

Wasserman 1
Schultz 1
was 1
defending 1
someone 1
investigators 1
allegedly 1
told 1
her 1
was 1
suspected 1
of 1
cybersecurity 1
violations, 1
despite 1
having 1
resigned 1
from 1
her 1
position 1
as 1
DNC 1
head 1
following 1
a 1
devastating 1
hack 1
during 1
the 1
2016 1
election. 1

Despite 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz’s 0
relationship 0
with 0
Awan, 0
in 0
April 0
2017 0
— 0
two 0
months 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
the 0
computer 0
network 0
— 0
the 0
IT 0
aide 0
appeared 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
congresswoman 0
at 0
risk. 0

Capitol 0
Police 0
found 0
a 0
laptop 0
with 0
the 0
username 0
RepDWS 0
in 0
a 0
phone 0
booth 0
at 0
midnight 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
Awan’s 0
ID, 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
prosecutors 0
and 0
a 0
note 0
that 0
said 0
“attorney 0
client 0
privilege,” 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
police 0
report. 0

Awan’s 0
ID 0
caused 0
police 0
to 0
tie 0
it 0
to 0
a 0
criminal 0
suspect 0
and 0
seize 0
it, 0
but 0
the 0
note 0
kept 0
them 0
from 0
looking 0
at 0
it. 0

That 0
led 0
to 0
a 0
tense 0
exchange 0
recorded 0
on 0
video 0
in 0
May 0
2017, 0
in 0
which 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
threatened 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
the 0
Capitol 0
Police 0
with 0
“consequences” 0
for 0
not 0
returning 0
the 0
laptop. 0

When 0
he 0
refused, 0
she 0
mulled 0
attempting 0
to 0
restructuring 0
the 0
Capitol 0
Police’s 0
entire 0
board 0
so 0
that 0
her 0
committee 0
would 0
have 0
more 0
leverage 0
over 0
it. 0

House 0
sources 0
told 0
TheDCNF 0
these 0
exchanges 0
were 0
only 0
a 0
public 0
glimpse 0
into 0
numerous 0
such 0
interactions, 0
which 0
were 0
frequently 0
profane, 1
with 1
every 1
official 1
she 1
could 1
buttonhole. 1

One 0

said 0
she 0
also 0
went 0
to 0
