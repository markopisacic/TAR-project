Palermo 0

in 0

during 0
the 0

and 0
is 0
now 0
speaking 0
out 0
about 0

the 0

Palermo, 0
who 0
has 0
done 0
various 0
interviews 0
since 0
the 0
attack, 0
appeared 0
on 0
“The 0
Blast” 0
with 0
a 0
series 1
of 1
shocking 1
comments 1
that 0
correlate 0
with 0
various 0
other 0
reports 0
indicating 0
that 0
multiple 0
shooters 0
carried 0
out 0
the 0
attack 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
is 0
actively 0
covering 0
this 0
up. 0

“I 0
definitely 0
do 0
believe 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
100% 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
shooter, 0
every 0
other 0
person 0
that 0
I’ve 0
talked 0
to 0
that 0
did 0
unfortunately 0
get 0
hit 0
as 0
well, 0
have 0
all 0
said 0
the 0
same 0
things,” 0
Palermo 0
detailed. 0

The 0
man 0
then 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
explain 0
that 0
after 0
being 0
shot 0
he 0
ran 0
“about 0
200 0
yards” 0
to 0
hide 0
behind 0
a 0
car, 0
all 0
the 0
while 0
hearing 0
bullets 0
fly 0
past 0
him 0
at 0
what 0
he 0
believes 0
was 0
ground 0
level. 0

“I’m 0
waiting 0
and 0
all 0
of 0
a 0
sudden 0
we 0
hear 0
a 0
little 0
whizzing 0
going 0
by 0
us, 0
all 0
of 0
a 0
sudden 0
bullets 0
are 0
just 0
flying 0
by,” 0
he 0
continued. 0

“When 0
something 0
is 0
coming 0
up 0
and 0
down 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
from 0
a 0
different 0
angle 0
they 0
are 0
either 0
going 0
to 0
hit 0
the 0
ground 0
or… 0
alot 0
of 0
different 0
things 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
happen. 0

When 0
someone 0
is 0
shooting 0
form 0
a 0
horizontal 0
line 0
its 0
just 0
going 0
to 0
keep 0
shooting,” 0
Palermo 0
attempted 0
to 0
explain. 0

Take 1
note 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
means 1
here 1
is 1
that 1
people 1
were 1
being 1
shot 1
at 1
from 1
ground 1
level 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
32nd 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
hotel. 1

Palermo 0
then 0
specifically 0
heard 0
the 0
gun 0
shots 0
get 0
“closer 0
and 0
closer” 0
before 0
quickly 0
deciding 0
it 0
was 0
once 0
again 0
time 0
to 0
run. 0

Shockingly, 0
he 0
then 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
detail 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
concert 0
the 0
previous 0
two 0
nights 0
everyone 0
had 0
exited 0
a 0
specific 0
way 0
but 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
this 0
route 0
was 0
locked 0
down 0
shortly 0
before 0
the 0
attack. 0

“Every 0
other 0
night 0
at 0
the 0
concert, 0
everybody 0
kinda 0
exited 0
right 0
off 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Blvd, 0
that 0
was 0
standard, 0
that 0
was 0
routine, 0
you 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
concert 0
and 0
you 0
go 0
down 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
casino,” 0
he 0
continued. 0

“At 0
10pm 0
they 0
closed 0
every 0
exit 0
on 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Blvd, 0
every 0
single 0
one. 0

They 0
gated 0
them 0
all 0
closed 0
with 0
chain-link 0
fences, 0
10:08 0
the 0
shooting 0
started 0
and 0
we 0
were 0
pigs 0
sitting 0
in 0
a 0
corral. 0

We 0
only 0
had 0
one 0
exit 0
to 0
go 0
out 0
of…..everyone 0
was 0
just 0
kinda 0
following 0
the 0
sheep.” 0

Palermo 0
makes 0
clear 0
this 0
confused 0
concert 0
goers 0
who 0
had 0
used 0
the 0
normal 0
exits 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

“The 0
same 0
exits 0
we 0
had 0
came 0
in 0
and 0
left 0
Friday 0
and 0
Saturday 0
night 0
were 0
definitely 0
closed. 0

There 0
were 0
people 0
that 0
went 0
over 0
there 0
and 0
tried 0
to 0
leave 0
and 0
there 0
were 0
cops 0
that 0
were 0
telling 0
them 0
no, 0
you 0
can’t 0
go 0
out 0
here, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
go 0
the 0
other 0
way,” 0
he 0
shockingly 0
concluded. 0

This 0
stunning 0
testimony 0
is 0
obviously 0
a 1
huge 1
bombshell 1
in 1
the 1
ongoing 1
investigation 1
of 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
mass 0
shooting 0
and 0
is 0
sure 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
add 0
credence 0
to 0
the 0
growing 0
belief 0
that 0
we 1
are 1
not 1
being 1
told 1
what 1
actually 1
happened 1
that 1
fateful 1
night. 1
