Donald 0

Bush 0

and 0
that 0
represented 0
departures 0
from 0
Reaganite 0

are: 0

First, 0
the 0
hubristic 0
drive, 0
despite 0
the 0
warnings 0
of 0
statesmen 0
like 0
George 0
Kennan, 0
to 0
exploit 0
our 0
Cold 0
War 0
victory 0
and 0
pursue 0
a 0
policy 0
of 0
permanent 0
containment 0
of 0
a 0
Russia 0
that 0
had 0
lost 0
a 0
third 0
of 0
its 0
territory 0
and 0
half 0
its 0
people. 0

We 0
moved 0
NATO 0
into 0
Eastern 0
Europe 0
and 0
the 0
Baltic, 0
onto 0
her 0
doorstep. 0

We 0
abrogated 0
the 0
ABM 0
treaty 0
Nixon 0
had 0
negotiated 0
and 0
moved 0
defensive 0
missiles 0
into 0

John 0

even 0
to 0
send 0
U.S. 0

to 0

off 0
against 0

Thus 0
we 0
got 0
a 0
second 0

that 0

never 0
have 0
begun 0
and 0
that 0
