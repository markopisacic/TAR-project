The 0
Kurds 0
have 0
no 0
friends 0
but 0
the 0
mountains, 0
is 0
an 0
old 0
lament 0
. 0

Last 0
week, 0
it 0
must 0
have 0
been 0
very 0
much 0
on 0
Kurdish 0
minds. 0

As 0
their 0
U.S. 0
allies 0
watched, 0
the 0
Kurdish 0
peshmerga 0
fighters 0
were 0
run 0
out 0
of 0
Kirkuk 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
territory 0
they 0
had 0
captured 0
fighting 0
ISIS 0
alongside 0
the 0
Americans. 0

The 0
Iraqi 0
army 0
that 0
ran 0
them 0
out 0
was 0
trained 0
and 0
armed 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
had 0
warned 0
the 0
Kurds 0
against 0
holding 0
the 0
referendum 0
on 0
independence 0
on 0
Sept. 0
25, 0
which 0
carried 0
with 0
92 0
percent. 0

Iran 0
and 0
Turkey 0
had 0
warned 0
against 0
an 0
independent 0
Kurdistan 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
magnet 0
for 0
Kurdish 0
minorities 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
countries. 0

But 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
Kurds 0
went 0
ahead. 0

Now 0
they 0
have 0
lost 0
Kirkuk 0
and 0
its 0
oil, 0
and 0
their 1
dream 1
of 1
independence 1
is 1
all 1
but 1
dead. 1

More 0
troubling 0
for 0
America 0
is 0
the 0
new 0
reality 0
revealed 0
by 0
the 0
rout 0
of 0
the 0
peshmerga. 0

Iraq, 0
which 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
the 0
neocons 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
fashion 0
into 0
a 0
pro-Western 0
democracy 0
and 0
American 0
ally, 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
close 0
to 0
Iran 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

After 0
4,500 0
U.S. 0
dead, 0
scores 0
of 0
thousands 0
wounded 0
and 0
a 0
trillion 0
dollars 0
sunk, 0
our 0
15-year 0
war 0
in 0
Iraq 0
could 0
end 0
with 0
a 0
Shiite-dominated 0
Baghdad 0
aligned 0
with 0
Tehran. 0

With 0
that 0
grim 0
prospect 0
in 0
mind, 0
Secretary 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
said 0
Sunday 0
, 0
"Iranian 0
militias 0
that 0
are 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
fight 0
against 0
... 0
ISIS 0
is 0
coming 0
to 0
a 0
close 0
... 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
home. 0

Any 0
foreign 0
fighters 0
in 0
Iraq 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
home." 0

Tillerson 0
meant 0
Iran's 0
Quds 0
Force 0
in 0
Iraq 0
should 0
go 0
home, 0
and 0
the 0
Shiite 0
militia 0
in 0
Iraq 0
should 0
be 0
conscripted 0
into 0
the 0
army. 0

But 1
what 1
if 1
the 1
Baghdad 1
regime 1
of 1
Haider 1
al-Abadi 1
does 1
not 1
agree? 1

What 1
if 1
the 1
Quds 1
Force 1
does 1
not 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
Iran 1
and 1
the 1
Shiite 1
militias 1
that 1
helped 1
retake 1
Kirkuk 1
refuse 1
to 1
enlist 1
in 1
the 1
Iraqi 1
army? 1

Who 0
then 0
enforces 0
Tillerson's 0
demands? 0

Consider 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
Syria. 0

The 0
U.S.-backed 0
Syrian 0
Democratic 0
Forces, 0
largely 0
Kurdish, 0
just 0
annihilated 0
ISIS 0
in 0
Raqqa 0
and 0
drove 0
60 0
miles 0
to 0
seize 0
Syria's 0
largest 0
oil 0
field, 0
al-Omar, 0
from 0
ISIS. 0

The 0
race 0
is 0
now 0
on 0
between 0
the 0
SDF 0
and 0
Bashar 0
Assad's 0
army 0
to 0
secure 0
the 0
border 0
with 0
Iraq. 0

Bottom 0
line: 0
The 0
U.S. 0
goal 0
of 0
crushing 0
the 0
ISIS 0
caliphate 0
is 0
almost 0
attained. 0

But 0
if 0
our 0
victory 0
in 0
the 0
war 0
against 0
ISIS 0
leaves 0
Iran 0
in 0
the 0
catbird 0
seat 0
in 0
Baghdad 0
and 0
Damascus, 0
and 0
its 0
corridor 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Baghdad, 0
Damascus 0
and 0
Beirut 0
secure, 1
is 1
that 1
really 1
a 1
victory? 1

Do 1
we 1
accept 1
that 1
outcome, 1
pack 1
up 1
and 1
go 1
home? 1

Or 1
do 1
we 1
leave 1
our 1
forces 1
in 1
Syria 1
and 1
Iraq 1
and 1
defy 1
any 1
demand 1
from 1
Assad 1
to 1
vacate 1
his 1
country? 1

Sunday's 0
editorial 0
in 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
"The 0
Next 0
Mideast 0
Wars," 0
raises 0
the 0
crucial 0
questions 0
now 0
before 0
us. 0

Would 0
President 0
Trump 0
be 0
willing 0
to 0
fight 0
a 0
new 0
war 0
to 0
keep 0
Iran 0
from 0
consolidating 0
its 0
position 0
in 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria? 0

Would 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
support 1
such 1
a 1
war 1
with 1
U.S. 1
troops? 1

Would 0
Congress, 0
apparently 1
clueless 1
to 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
800 1
U.S. 1
troops 1
in 1
Niger, 1
authorize 0
a 0
new 0
U.S. 0
war 0
in 0
Syria 0
or 0
Iraq? 0

If 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
generals 0
felt 0
our 0
vital 0
interests 0
could 0
not 0
allow 0
Syria 0
and 0
Iraq 0
to 0
drift 0
into 0
the 0
orbit 0
of 0
Iran, 0
where 0
would 0
we 0
find 0
allies 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
fight? 0

If 1
we 1
rely 1
on 1
the 1
Kurds 1
in 1
Syria, 1
we 1
lose 1
NATO 1
ally 1
Turkey, 1
which 1
regards 1
Syria's 1
Kurds 1
as 1
collaborators 1
of 1
the 1
PKK 1
in 1
Turkey, 1
which 1
even 1
the 1
U.S. 1
designates 1
a 1
terrorist 1
organization. 1

The 0
decision 0
as 0
to 0
whether 0
this 0
country 0
should 0
engage 0
in 0
new 0
post-ISIS 0
wars 0
in 0
the 0
Mideast, 0
however, 0
may 0
be 0
taken 0
out 0
of 0
our 0
hands. 0

Saturday, 0
Israel 0
launched 0
new 0
air 0
strikes 0
against 0
gun 0
positions 0
in 0
Syria 0
in 0
retaliation 0
for 0
shells 0
fired 0
into 0
the 0
Golan 0
Heights. 0

Damascus 0
claims 0
that 0
Israel's 0
"terrorist" 1
allies 0
inside 0
Syria 0
fired 0
the 0
shells, 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
IDF 0
an 0
excuse 0
to 0
attack. 0

Why 0
would 0
Israel 0
wish 0
to 0
provoke 0
a 0
war 0
with 0
Syria? 0

Because 0
the 0
Israelis 0
see 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
six-year 0
Syrian 0
civil 0
war 0
as 0
a 0
strategic 0
disaster. 0

Hezbollah, 0
stronger 0
than 0
ever, 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
Assad's 0
victorious 0
coalition. 0

Iran 0
may 0
have 0
secured 0
its 0
land 0
corridor 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Beirut. 0

Its 0
presence 0
in 0
Syria 0
could 0
now 0
be 0
permanent. 0

And 1
only 1
one 1
force 1
in 1
the 1
region 1
has 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
reverse 1
the 1
present 1
outcome 1
of 1
Syria's 1
civil 1
war--the 1
United 1
States. 1

Bibi 0
Netanyahu 0
knows 0
that 0
if 0
war 0
with 0
Syria 0
breaks 0
out, 0
a 0
clamor 0
will 0
arise 0
in 0
Congress 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
U.S. 0
rush 0
to 0
Israel's 0
aid. 0

"A 0
failure 1
by 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
to 1
defend 1
its 1
allies 1
or 1
promote 1
new 1
political 1
arrangements 1
for 1
(Syria 1
and 1
Iraq) 1
will 1
lead 1
only 1
to 1
more 1
war, 1
the 1
rise 1
of 1
new 1
terrorist 1
threats, 1
and, 1
ultimately, 1
the 1
necessity 1
of 1
more 1
U.S. 1

intervention." 1
