Was 0 439 0

Leftwing 0 439 1
journalist 0 439 1
Glenn 0 439 1
Greenwald 0 439 1
is 0 439 1
no 0 439 1
fan 0 439 1
of 0 439 1
President 0 439 1
Trump’s 0 439 1
policies, 0 439 1
but 0 439 1
he 0 439 1
simply 0 439 1
cannot 0 439 1
understand 0 439 1
how 0 439 1
the 0 439 1
leftwing 0 439 1
media 0 439 1
keeps 0 439 1
getting 0 439 1
so 0 439 1
riled 0 439 1
up 0 439 1
at 0 439 1
everything 0 439 1
that 0 439 1
Trump 0 439 1
does. 0 439 1

In 0 439 2
Greenwald’s 0 439 2
mind, 0 439 2
Trump 0 439 2
is 0 439 2
a 0 439 2
fairly 0 439 2
standard 1 439 2
politician 1 439 2
(when 0 439 2
it 0 439 2
comes 0 439 2
to 0 439 2
the 0 439 2
policies 0 439 2
he 0 439 2
supports 0 439 2
and 0 439 2
implements), 0 439 2
which 0 439 2
is 0 439 2
what 0 439 2
makes 0 439 2
the 0 439 2
media’s 0 439 2
constant 0 439 2
flow 0 439 2
of 0 439 2
outrage 0 439 2
so 0 439 2
mystifying. 0 439 2

In 0 439 3
a 0 439 3
recent 0 439 3
debate 0 439 3
over 0 439 3
the 0 439 3
Helsinki 0 439 3
Hulabaloo, 0 439 3
Greenwald 0 439 3
told 0 439 3
the 0 439 3
leftists 0 439 3
at 0 439 3
Democracy 0 439 3
Now! 0 439 3

that 0 439 4
getting 0 439 4
all 0 439 4
worked 0 439 4
up 0 439 4
over 0 439 4
Trump’s 0 439 4
press 0 439 4
conference 0 439 4
with 0 439 4
Putin 0 439 4
was 0 439 4
ridiculous. 1 439 4

Why? 0 439 5

Because, 0 439 6
when 0 439 6
Trump’s 0 439 6
Russia 0 439 6
policies 0 439 6
are 0 439 6
measured 0 439 6
against 0 439 6
Obama’s… 0 439 6
it 0 439 6
becomes 0 439 6
CLEAR 0 439 6
that 0 439 6
Trump 1 439 6
has 1 439 6
obviously 1 439 6
been 1 439 6
tougher 1 439 6
against 1 439 6
Russia 1 439 6
than 1 439 6

Here’s 0 439 18
the 0 439 18
crux 0 439 18
of 0 439 18
Greenwald’s 0 439 18
argument: 0 439 18

So 0 439 19
let 0 439 19
me 0 439 19
just 0 439 19
make 0 439 19
two 0 439 19
points. 0 439 19

Number 0 439 20
one 0 439 20
is, 0 439 20
if 0 439 20
you 0 439 20
look 0 439 20
at 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Obama 0 439 20
versus 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Trump, 0 439 20
there’s 0 439 20
no 0 439 20
question 0 439 20
that 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Obama 0 439 20
was 0 439 20
more 0 439 20
cooperative 0 439 20
with 0 439 20
and 0 439 20
collaborative 0 439 20
with 0 439 20
Russia 0 439 20
and 0 439 20
the 0 439 20
Russian 0 439 20
agenda 0 439 20
than 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Trump. 0 439 20

President 0 439 21
Trump 0 439 21
has 0 439 21
sent 0 439 21
lethal 1 439 21
arms 0 439 21
to 0 439 21
Ukraine—a 0 439 21
crucial 0 439 21
issue 0 439 21
for 0 439 21
Putin—which 0 439 21
President 0 439 21
Obama 0 439 21
refused 0 439 21
to 0 439 21
do. 0 439 21

President 0 439 22
Trump 0 439 22
has 0 439 22
bombed 0 439 22
the 0 439 22
Assad 0 439 22
forces 0 439 22
in 0 439 22
Syria, 0 439 22
a 0 439 22
client 0 439 22
state 0 439 22
of 0 439 22
Putin, 0 439 22
something 0 439 22
that 0 439 22
Obama 0 439 22
refused 0 439 22
to 0 439 22
do 0 439 22
because 0 439 22
he 0 439 22
didn’t 0 439 22
want 0 439 22
to 0 439 22
provoke 0 439 22
Putin. 0 439 22

Trump 0 439 23
has 0 439 23
expelled 0 439 23
more 1 439 23
Russian 0 439 23
diplomats 0 439 23
and 0 439 23
sanctioned 0 439 23
more 1 439 23
Russian 0 439 23
oligarchs 0 439 23
than 0 439 23
[Obama] 0 439 23
has. 0 439 23

Trump 0 439 24
undid 0 439 24
the 0 439 24
Iran 0 439 24
deal, 0 439 24
which 0 439 24
Russia 0 439 24
favored, 0 439 24
while 0 439 24
Obama 0 439 24
worked 0 439 24
with 0 439 24
Russia 0 439 24
in 0 439 24
order 0 439 24
to 0 439 24
do 0 439 24
the 0 439 24
Iran 0 439 24
deal. 0 439 24

So 0 439 25
this 0 439 25
idea 0 439 25
that 0 439 25
Trump 0 439 25
is 0 439 25
some 0 439 25
kind 0 439 25
of 0 439 25
a 0 439 25
puppet 1 439 25
of 0 439 25
Putin, 0 439 25
that 0 439 25
he 0 439 25
controls 0 439 25
him 0 439 25
with 0 439 25
blackmail, 0 439 25
is 0 439 25
the 0 439 25
kind 0 439 25
of 0 439 25
stuff 0 439 25
that 0 439 25
you 0 439 25
believe 0 439 25
if 0 439 25
you 0 439 25
read 0 439 25
too 0 439 25
many 0 439 25

Tom 0 439 26
Clancy 0 439 26
novels 0 439 26
but 0 439 26
isn’t 0 439 26
borne 0 439 26
out 0 439 26
by 0 439 26
the 0 439 26
facts. 0 439 26

The 0 439 27
other 0 439 27
issue 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
I 0 439 27
want 0 439 27
to 0 439 27
make 0 439 27
is 0 439 27
that, 0 439 27
you 0 439 27
know, 0 439 27
again, 0 439 27
this 0 439 27
idea 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
somehow 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
you 0 439 27
are 0 439 27
endorsing 0 439 27
the 0 439 27
repression 0 439 27
of 0 439 27
other 0 439 27
countries’ 0 439 27
leaders 0 439 27
if 0 439 27
you 0 439 27
meet 0 439 27
with 0 439 27
them—it 0 439 27
is 0 439 27
true 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
Trump 0 439 27
has 0 439 27
never 0 439 27
criticized 0 439 27
Putin, 0 439 27
although 0 439 27
he 0 439 27
has 0 439 27
taken 0 439 27
all 0 439 27
the 0 439 27
steps 0 439 27
I 0 439 27
just 0 439 27
outlined 0 439 27
against 0 439 27
Putin. 0 439 27

But 0 439 28
he’s 0 439 28
also 0 439 28
never 1 439 28
criticized 0 439 28
Benjamin 0 439 28
Netanyahu. 0 439 28

He’s 0 439 29
also 0 439 29
never 1 439 29
criticized 0 439 29
the 0 439 29
incredibly 1 439 29
repressive 1 439 29
leaders 0 439 29
of 0 439 29
Saudi 0 439 29
Arabia. 0 439 29

He’s 0 439 30
never 1 439 30
criticized 0 439 30
the 0 439 30
fascist 1 439 30
president 0 439 30
of 0 439 30
the 0 439 30
Philippines. 0 439 30

It 0 439 31
is 0 439 31
true 0 439 31
President 0 439 31
Trump 0 439 31
likes 0 439 31
fascist 0 439 31
and 0 439 31
authoritarian 0 439 31
leaders, 0 439 31
and 0 439 31
that 0 439 31
is 0 439 31
a 0 439 31
problem, 0 439 31
but 0 439 31
it’s 0 439 31
not 0 439 31
like 0 439 31
Putin 0 439 31
is 0 439 31
the 0 439 31
only 0 439 31
leader 0 439 31
that 0 439 31
he 0 439 31
doesn’t 0 439 31
criticize. 0 439 31

The 0 439 32
relevant 0 439 32
portion 0 439 32
of 0 439 32
the 0 439 32
debate 0 439 32
