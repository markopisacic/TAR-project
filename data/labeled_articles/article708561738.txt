We 0 123 4
finally 0 123 4
have 0 123 4
the 0 123 4
official 0 123 4

they 1 123 4
aren’t 1 123 4

Reid 0 123 5
Wilson, 0 123 5
a 0 123 5
correspondent 0 123 5
for 0 123 5
the 0 123 5
Hill, 0 123 5
has 0 123 5
posted 0 123 5
to 0 123 5
Twitter 0 123 5
a 0 123 5
year 0 123 5
by 0 123 5
year 0 123 5
breakdown 0 123 5
of 0 123 5
sexual 0 123 5
harassment 0 123 5
settlements 0 123 5
and 0 123 5
awards 0 123 5
that 0 123 5
he 0 123 5
received 0 123 5
from 0 123 5
the 0 123 5
Congressional 0 123 5
Office 0 123 5
of 0 123 5
Compliance. 0 123 5

I 0 123 6
went 0 123 6
ahead 0 123 6
and 0 123 6
added 0 123 6
up 0 123 6
each 0 123 6
column, 0 123 6
and 0 123 6
what 0 123 6
I 0 123 6
discovered 0 123 6
is 0 123 6
that 0 123 6
264 0 123 6
cases 0 123 6
of 0 123 6
sexual 0 123 6
harassment 0 123 6
in 0 123 6
Congress 0 123 6
have 0 123 6
been 0 123 6
settled 0 123 6
since 0 123 6
1997, 0 123 6
and 0 123 6
the 0 123 6
total 0 123 6
amount 0 123 6
awarded 0 123 6
in 0 123 6
those 0 123 6
settlements 0 123 6
comes 0 123 6
to 0 123 6
a 0 123 6
grand 0 123 6
total 0 123 6
of 0 123 6
$17,250,854. 0 123 6

So 0 123 7
where 0 123 7
has 0 123 7
the 0 123 7
$17,250,854 0 123 7
come 0 123 7
from 0 123 7
to 0 123 7
pay 0 123 7
those 0 123 7
settlements? 0 123 7

That 1 123 8
money 1 123 8
has 1 123 8
come 1 123 8
from 1 123 8
the 1 123 8
taxpayers 1 123 8
of 1 123 8
course. 1 123 8

That 0 123 9
means 0 123 9
that 0 123 9
you 0 123 9
and 0 123 9
I 0 123 9
have 0 123 9
been 0 123 9
paying 0 123 9
to 0 123 9
cover 0 123 9
up 0 123 9
the 1 123 9
epidemic 1 123 9
of 1 123 9
sexual 1 123 9
harassment 1 123 9
that 0 123 9
has 0 123 9
been 0 123 9
taking 0 123 9
place 0 123 9
on 0 123 9
Capitol 0 123 9
Hill. 0 123 9

When 0 123 10
U.S. 0 123 10
Representative 0 123 10
Jackie 0 123 10
Speier 0 123 10
originally 0 123 10
told 0 123 10
us 0 123 10
that 0 123 10
more 0 123 10
than 0 123 10
15 0 123 10
million 0 123 10
dollars 0 123 10
had 0 123 10
been 0 123 10
paid 0 123 10
out 0 123 10
to 0 123 10
victims 0 123 10
of 0 123 10
sexual 0 123 10
harassment 0 123 10
in 0 123 10
recent 0 123 10
years, 0 123 10
I 0 123 10
was 0 123 10
envisioning 0 123 10
a 0 123 10
few 0 123 10
dozen 0 123 10
cases 0 123 10
at 0 123 10
most. 0 123 10

I 0 123 11
had 0 123 11
no 0 123 11
idea 0 123 11
that 0 123 11
the 0 123 11
total 0 123 11
number 0 123 11
of 0 123 11
cases 0 123 11
would 0 123 11
actually 0 123 11
be 0 123 11
well 0 123 11
over 0 123 11
200. 0 123 11

If 0 123 12
our 0 123 12
leaders 0 123 12
were 0 123 12
serious 0 123 12
about 0 123 12
stopping 0 123 12
this 0 123 12
from 0 123 12
happening, 0 123 12
they 0 123 12
would 0 123 12
pass 0 123 12
a 0 123 12
law 0 123 12
making 0 123 12
it 0 123 12
mandatory 0 123 12
that 0 123 12
all 0 123 12
cases 0 123 12
of 0 123 12
sexual 0 123 12
harassment 0 123 12
in 0 123 12
Congress 0 123 12
be 0 123 12
made 0 123 12
public, 0 123 12
and 0 123 12
that 0 123 12
members 0 123 12
of 0 123 12
Congress 0 123 12
would 0 123 12
be 0 123 12
personally 0 123 12
responsible 0 123 12
for 0 123 12
paying 0 123 12
out 0 123 12
any 0 123 12
settlements. 0 123 12

If 1 123 13
such 1 123 13
a 1 123 13
law 1 123 13
was 1 123 13
instituted, 1 123 13
I 1 123 13
guarantee 1 123 13
you 1 123 13
that 1 123 13
sexual 1 123 13
harassment 1 123 13
on 1 123 13
Capitol 1 123 13
Hill 1 123 13
would 1 123 13
come 1 123 13
to 1 123 13
a 1 123 13
screeching 1 123 13
halt. 1 123 13

But 0 123 14
they 0 123 14
don’t 0 123 14
want 0 123 14
it 0 123 14
to 0 123 14
stop. 0 123 14

For 1 123 15
many 1 123 15
in 1 123 15
Congress, 1 123 15
having 1 123 15
so 1 123 15
many 1 123 15
attractive 1 123 15
young 1 123 15
women 1 123 15
around 1 123 15
is 1 123 15
one 1 123 15
of 1 123 15
the 1 123 15
key 1 123 15
benefits 1 123 15
of 1 123 15
the 1 123 15
job. 1 123 15

I 0 123 16
included 0 123 16
the 0 123 16
following 0 123 16
quote 0 123 16
from 0 123 16
CNN 0 123 16
in 0 123 16
an 0 123 16
article 0 123 16
the 0 123 16
other 0 123 16
day, 0 123 16
but 0 123 16
I 0 123 16
also 0 123 16
believe 0 123 16
that 0 123 16
it 0 123 16
fits 0 123 16
just 0 123 16
perfectly 0 123 16
here… 0 123 16

In 0 123 17
an 0 123 17
environment 0 123 17
with 0 123 17
“so 0 123 17
many 0 123 17
young 0 123 17
women,” 0 123 17
said 0 123 17
one 0 123 17
ex-House 0 123 17
aide, 0 123 17
the 1 123 17
men 1 123 17
“have 1 123 17
no 1 123 17
self-control.” 1 123 17
“Amongst 0 123 17
ourselves, 0 123 17
we 0 123 17
know,” 0 123 17
a 0 123 17
former 0 123 17
Senate 0 123 17
staffer 0 123 17
said 0 123 17
of 0 123 17
the 1 123 17
lawmakers 1 123 17
with 1 123 17
the 1 123 17
worst 1 123 17
reputations. 1 123 17

And 0 123 18
sometimes, 0 123 18
the 0 123 18
sexual 0 123 18
advances 0 123 18
from 0 123 18
members 0 123 18
of 0 123 18
Congress 0 123 18
or 0 123 18
senior 0 123 18
aides 0 123 18
are 0 123 18
reciprocated 0 123 18
in 0 123 18
the 0 123 18
hopes 0 123 18
of 0 123 18
advancing 0 123 18
one’s 0 123 18
career 0 123 18
— 0 123 18
what 0 123 18
one 0 123 18
political 0 123 18
veteran 0 123 18
bluntly 0 123 18
referred 0 123 18
to 0 123 18
as 0 123 18
a 0 123 18
“sex 1 123 18
trade 1 123 18
on 1 123 18
Capitol 1 123 18
Hill.” 1 123 18

Do 0 123 19
you 0 123 19
want 0 123 19
to 0 123 19
stop 0 123 19
this 0 123 19
from 0 123 19
happening? 0 123 19

It 1 123 20
isn’t 1 123 20
going 1 123 20
to 1 123 20
stop 1 123 20
until 1 123 20
we 1 123 20
boot 1 123 20
out 1 123 20
the 1 123 20
corrupt 1 123 20
career 1 123 20
politicians 1 123 20
that 1 123 20
are 1 123 20
engaging 1 123 20
in 1 123 20
this 1 123 20
type 1 123 20
of 1 123 20
behavior. 1 123 20

So 0 123 21
I 0 123 21
am 0 123 21
asking 0 123 21
you 0 123 21
to 0 123 21
support 0 123 21
my 0 123 21
campaign 0 123 21
and 0 123 21
other 0 123 21
“grassroots 1 123 21
deplorables” 1 123 21
that 0 123 21
are 0 123 21
running 0 123 21
for 0 123 21
office 0 123 21
all 0 123 21
over 0 123 21
the 0 123 21
nation. 0 123 21

Morality 0 123 22
really 0 123 22
matters 0 123 22
when 0 123 22
it 0 123 22
comes 0 123 22
to 0 123 22
serving 0 123 22
in 0 123 22
public 0 123 22
office, 0 123 22
and 0 123 22
we 0 123 22
are 0 123 22
not 0 123 22
going 0 123 22
to 0 123 22
send 0 123 22
people 0 123 22
that 0 123 22
engage 0 123 22
in 0 123 22
sexually 0 123 22
inappropriate 0 123 22
behavior 0 123 22
to 0 123 22
Washington 0 123 22
anymore. 0 123 22

And 0 123 23
I 0 123 23
am 0 123 23
calling 0 123 23
on 0 123 23
Congress 0 123 23
to 0 123 23
immediately 0 123 23
release 0 123 23
the 0 123 23
details 0 123 23
of 0 123 23
all 0 123 23
of 0 123 23
the 0 123 23
264 0 123 23
cases 0 123 23
of 0 123 23
sexual 0 123 23
harassment 0 123 23
that 0 123 23
have 0 123 23
been 0 123 23
settled 0 123 23
since 0 123 23
1997. 0 123 23

The 1 123 24
American 1 123 24
people 1 123 24
have 1 123 24
a 1 123 24
right 1 123 24
to 1 123 24
know, 1 123 24
and 0 123 24
those 0 123 24
that 0 123 24
engaged 0 123 24
in 0 123 24
this 0 123 24
type 0 123 24
of 0 123 24
behavior 0 123 24
do 0 123 24
not 0 123 24
have 0 123 24
a 0 123 24
right 0 123 24
to 0 123 24
hide. 0 123 24

It 0 123 25
is 0 123 25
time 0 123 25
to 0 123 25
drain 0 123 25
the 0 123 25
swamp, 0 123 25
and 0 123 25
this 0 123 25
would 0 123 25
be 0 123 25
a 0 123 25
really 0 123 25
good 0 123 25
place 0 123 25
to 0 123 25
start. 0 123 25
