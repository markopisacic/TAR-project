WASHINGTON 0 4 1
— 0 4 1
President 0 4 1
Donald 0 4 1
Trump 0 4 1
formally 0 4 1
notified 0 4 1
Congress 0 4 1
on 0 4 1
Tuesday 0 4 1
that 0 4 1
deputy 0 4 1
CIA 0 4 1
director 0 4 1
Gina 0 4 1
Haspel 0 4 1
is 0 4 1
his 0 4 1
pick 0 4 1
to 0 4 1
lead 0 4 1
the 0 4 1
agency. 0 4 1

Trump 0 4 2
tweeted 0 4 2
last 0 4 2
month 0 4 2
that 0 4 2
he 0 4 2
had 0 4 2
selected 0 4 2
Haspel 0 4 2
to 0 4 2
replace 0 4 2
Mike 0 4 2
Pompeo, 0 4 2
who 0 4 2
is 0 4 2
being 0 4 2
considered 0 4 2
to 0 4 2
be 0 4 2
secretary 0 4 2
of 0 4 2
state. 0 4 2

But 0 4 3
the 0 4 3
president 0 4 3
had 0 4 3
not 0 4 3
sent 0 4 3
the 0 4 3
formal 0 4 3
paperwork 0 4 3
to 0 4 3
Capitol 0 4 3
Hill. 0 4 3

including 0 4 4
an 0 4 4

background 0 4 4
check 0 4 4
that 0 4 4
took 0 4 4
longer 0 4 4
than 0 4 4
expected, 0 4 4
was 0 4 4
to 0 4 4
blame, 0 4 4
according 0 4 4
to 0 4 4
a 0 4 4
U.S. 0 4 4
official, 0 4 4
who 0 4 4
was 0 4 4
not 0 4 4
authorized 0 4 4
to 0 4 4
discuss 0 4 4
the 0 4 4
issue 0 4 4
and 0 4 4
spoke 0 4 4
only 0 4 4
on 0 4 4
condition 0 4 4
of 0 4 4
anonymity. 0 4 4

Still, 0 4 5
the 0 4 5
delay 0 4 5
prompted 0 4 5
critics 0 4 5
to 0 4 5
speculate 0 4 5
that 0 4 5
the 1 4 5
delay 1 4 5
signaled 1 4 5
the 1 4 5
White 1 4 5
House 1 4 5
was 1 4 5
having 1 4 5
second 1 4 5
thoughts 1 4 5
about 1 4 5
the 1 4 5
nomination. 1 4 5

Some 0 4 6
lawmakers 0 4 6
and 0 4 6
human 0 4 6
rights 0 4 6
groups 0 4 6
oppose 0 4 6
Haspel’s 0 4 6
nomination 0 4 6
because 0 4 6
of 0 4 6
her 0 4 6
role 0 4 6
in 0 4 6
the 0 4 6
CIA’s 0 4 6
detention 0 4 6
and 0 4 6
harsh 0 4 6
interrogation 0 4 6
of 0 4 6
terror 0 4 6
suspects 0 4 6
after 0 4 6
9/11. 0 4 6

The 0 4 7
Senate 0 4 7
intelligence 0 4 7
committee 0 4 7
is 0 4 7
expected 0 4 7
to 0 4 7
have 0 4 7
a 0 4 7
confirmation 0 4 7
hearing 0 4 7
for 0 4 7
Haspel 0 4 7
in 0 4 7
coming 0 4 7
weeks, 0 4 7
followed 0 4 7
by 0 4 7
a 0 4 7
