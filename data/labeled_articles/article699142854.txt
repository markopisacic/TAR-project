THE 0

OF 0
TRUMP'S 0
IRAN 0
INITIATIVE 0

Originally 0
published 0
the 0
Jerusalem 0
Post. 0

On 0
Friday, 0
US 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
initiated 0
an 0
important 0
change 0
in 0
US 0
policy 0
toward 0
Iran. 0

No, 0

in 0
his 0
speech 0
decertifying 0
Iran’s 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
nuclear 0
accord 0
it 0
struck 0
with 0
his 0
predecessor 0
Barack 0
Obama, 0
Trump 0
didn’t 0
announce 0
a 0
new 0
strategy 0
for 0
preventing 0
Iran 0
from 0
acquiring 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
or 0
stemming 0
its 0
hegemonic 0
rise 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East, 0
or 0
limiting 0
its 0
ability 0
to 0
sponsor 0
terrorism. 0

Trump’s 0
move 0
was 0
not 0
operational. 0

It 0
was 0
directional. 0

In 0

his 0
address 0
Friday, 0
Trump 0
changed 0
the 0
policy 0
dynamics 0
that 0
dictate 0
US 0
policy 0
on 0
Iran. 0

For 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
since 0
2009, 0
when 0
Obama 0
backed 0
the 0
murderous 1
regime 1
in 0
Tehran, 0
spurning 0
the 0
millions 0
of 0
Iranians 0
who 0
rose 0
up 0
in 0
the 0
Green 0
Revolution, 0
Trump 0
opened 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
may 0
begin 0
to 0
base 0
its 0
policies 0
toward 0
Iran 0
on 0
reality. 0

Trump 0

began 0
his 0
remarks 0
by 0
setting 0
out 0
Iran’s 1
long 1
rap 1
sheet 1
of 1
aggression 1
against 1
America. 1

Starting 0

with 0
the 0
US 0
embassy 0
seizure 1
and 1
hostage 1
crisis, 1
Trump 1
described 1
Iran’s 1
crimes 1
and 1
acts 1
of 1
war 1
against 1
America 1
in 0
greater 0
detail 0
than 0
any 0
of 0
his 0
predecessors 0
ever 0
did. 0

Trump’s 0

dossier 0
was 0
interlaced 0
with 0
condemnations 0
of 0
the 0
regime’s 0
repression 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
people. 0

By 0

merging 0
Iran’s 0
external 0
aggression 0
with 0
its 0
internal 0
repression, 0
Trump 0
signaled 0
a 0
readiness 0
to 0
drive 0
a 0
wedge 0
– 0
or 0
expand 0
the 0
wedge 0
– 0
between 0
the 1
authoritarian 1
theocrats 1
that 0
rule 0
Iran 0
and 0
the 0
largely 0
secular, 0
multiethnic 0
and 0
pro-Western 0
people 0
of 0
Iran. 0

Trump 0

then 0
turned 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
illicit 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
program, 0
its 0
sponsorship 1
of 1
terrorism, 1
including 0
its 0
links 0
to 0
al-Qaida, 0
its 0
aggression 0
against 0
its 0
neighbors, 0
its 0
aggressive 0
acts 0
against 0
maritime 0
traffic 0
in 0
the 0
Straits 0
of 0
Hormuz, 0
and 0
its 0
bids 0
to 0
destabilize 0
and 0
control 0
large 0
swaths 0
of 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
through 0
its 0
proxies. 0

It 0

is 0
notable 0
that 0
these 0
remarks 0
preceded 0
Trump’s 0
discussion 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
– 0
which 0
was 0
the 0
ostensible 0
subject 0
of 0
his 0
speech. 0

Before 0
Trump 0
discussed 0
Iran’s 0
breaches 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
he 0
first 0
demonstrated 0
that 0
contrary 0
to 0
the 0
expressed 0
views 0
of 0
his 0
top 0
advisers, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
limit 0
a 0
realistic 0
discussion 0
of 0
the 1
threat 1
Iran 1
constitutes 1
to 1
US 1
national 1
security 1
and 1
interests 1
to 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
and 0
it 0
what 0
manner 0
it 0
is 0
breaching 0
the 0
nuclear 0
accord. 0

This 0

was 0
a 0
critical 0
point 0
because 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
two 0
years, 0
US 0
discourse 0
on 0
Iran 0
has 0
focused 0
solely 0
on 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Iran 0
was 0
complying 0
with 0
Obama’s 0
nuclear 0
pact. 0

By 0
placing 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
consistent, 0
overarching 1
hostility 1
and 1
aggression, 1
Trump 0
made 0
it 0
self-evident 0
that 0
no 0
US 0
interest 0
is 0
served 0
in 0
continuing 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
a 0
free 0
pass 0
from 0
congressional 0
sanctions. 0

After 0

accomplishing 0
that 0
goal, 0
Trump 0
turned 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
how 0
Iran 0
is 0
actually 0
breaching 0
the 0
letter 0
and 0
spirit 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
pact. 0

Only 0
then, 0
almost 0
as 0
an 0
afterthought, 0
did 0
he 0
announce 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
decertifying 0
Iranian 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
setting 0
the 0
conditions 0
for 0
the 0
renewal 0
of 0
congressional 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
and 0
opening 0
the 0
floodgates 0
of 0
congressional 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
in 0
retaliation 0
for 0
the 0
full 0
spectrum 0
of 0
its 0
aggressive 1
and 1
illicit 1
acts 1
against 1
the 1
US, 1
its 1
interests 1
and 1
allies. 1

By 0

empowering 0
Congress 0
to 0
prohibit 0
economic 0
cooperation 0
with 0
Iran, 0
Trump 0
put 0
the 0
Europeans, 0
Chinese 0
and 0
Russians 0
on 0
notice 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
soon 0
face 0
a 0
choice 0
between 0
conducting 0
business 0
with 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
conducting 0
business 0
with 0
Iran. 0

After 0

putting 0
them 0
on 0
notice, 0
Trump 0
discussed 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
improving 0
Obama’s 0
nuclear 0
accord. 0

Among 0
other 0
things, 0
he 0
suggested 0
expanding 0
the 0
inspection 0
regime 0
against 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
installations 0
and 0
canceling 0
the 0
so-called 0
“sunset” 0
clause 0
that 0
places 0
an 0
end 0
date 0
on 0
the 0
restrictions 0
governing 0
certain 0
components 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
advancement. 0

Trump’s 0

address 0
has 0
the 0
potential 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
the 0
foundation 0
of 0
a 0
major, 0
positive 0
shift 0
in 0
US 0
policy 0
toward 0
Iran. 0

Such 0
a 0
shift 0
could 0
potentially 0
facilitate 0
the 0
achievement 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
goals 0
of 0
preventing 0
Iran 0
from 0
acquiring 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
containing 0
its 0
regional 0
aggression 0
and 0
empowerment 0
and 0
defeating 0
its 0
terrorist 0
proxies. 0

Unfortunately, 1

it 1
is 1
also 1
likely, 1
indeed, 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
likely, 1
that 1
his 1
words 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
translated 1
into 1
policies 1
to 1
achieve 1
these 1
critical 1
aims. 1

Trump’s 0

decision 0
to 0
transfer 0
immediate 0
responsibility 0
to 0
Congress 0
for 0
holding 0
Iran 0
accountable 0
for 0
its 0
hostile 0
actions 0
on 0
the 0
military 0
and 0
other 0
fronts 0
is 0
a 0
risky 0
move. 0

He 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
enemies, 0
and 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
supporters 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill. 0

Obama 0

would 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
implement 0
his 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
if 0
Senator 0
Bob 0
Corker, 0
chairman 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Foreign 0
Affairs 0
Committee, 0
hadn’t 0
agreed 0
to 0
cast 0
the 0
Constitution 0
aside 0
and 0
ignore 0
Obama’s 0
constitutional 0
duty 0
to 0
present 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
for 0
ratification 0
as 0
a 0
treaty. 0

Over 0

the 0
past 0
week, 0
Trump 0
and 0
Corker 0
have 0
been 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
ugly 1
public 1
fight 1
precipitated 0
by 0
Corker’s 0
announcement 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
seeking 0
reelection 0
next 0
year. 0

Today 0

Corker 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
restrain 0
him 0
from 0
scuttling 0
Trump’s 0
agenda. 0

If 0
he 0
wishes, 0
out 0
of 0
spite, 0
Corker 0
can 0
block 0
effective 0
sanctions 0
from 0
being 0
passed. 0

And 0
he 0
may 0
do 0
so 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
implications 0
for 0
his 0
Senate 0
colleagues 0
would 0
be 0
dire 0
and 0
even 0
though 0
doing 0
so 0
would 0
render 0
him 0
an 0
unofficial 0
protector 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
program. 0

What 0

is 0
true 0
for 0
Corker 0
is 0
doubly 0
true 0
for 0
the 0
Democrats. 0

Leading 0

Democratic 0
senators 0
like 0
Robert 0
Menendez, 0
Ben 0
Cardin 0
and 0
Chuck 0
Schumer, 0
who 0
opposed 0
Obama’s 0
Iran 0
deal 0
may 0
now 0
feel 0
that 0
as 0
opponents 0
of 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration, 0
they 0
are 0
required 0
to 0
oppose 0
any 0
change 0
to 0
the 0
Iran 0
Nuclear 0
Agreement 0
Review 0
Act. 0

Indeed, 0

given 0
the 0
rise 0
of 0
radical 0
forces 0
in 0
their 0
party 0
it 0
is 0
likely 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
rather 0
give 0
Iran 0
a 0
free 0
pass 0
for 0
its 0
anti-American 0
aggression 0
and 0
nuclear 0
proliferation 0
than 0
work 0
with 0
Republicans 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Then 0

again, 0
by 0
framing 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
threat 0
to 0
America 0
as 0
he 0
did, 0
and 0
by 0
transferring 0
responsibility 0
for 0
reinstating 0
sanctions 0
and 0
passing 0
further 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
to 0
Congress, 0
Trump 0
opened 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
Congress 0
will 0
conduct 0
substantive 0
– 0
rather 0
than 0
personal 0
– 0
debates 0
on 0
Iran. 0

And 0

the 0
more 0
substantive 0
those 0
debates 0
become, 0
the 0
further 0
away 0
the 0
US 0
discourse 0
will 0
move 0
from 0
the 0
mendacious 0
assumptions 0
of 0
Obama’s 0
Iran 0
policy 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
is 0
a 0
responsible 0
actor 0
and 0
potential 0
US 0
ally, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
inherently 0
aggressive 0
or 0
problematic 0
about 0
Iran’s 0
illicit 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
program. 0

The 0

second 0
major 0
risk 0
inherent 0
in 0
Trump’s 0
approach 0
is 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
get 0
his 0
way; 0
that 0
the 0
Europeans, 0
Russians 0
and 0
Chinese 0
and 0
the 0
Iranians 0
will 0
agree 0
to 0
improve 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

The 0
problem 0
here 0
is 0
not 0
obvious. 0

Clearly, 0
it 0
is 0
better 0
if 0
the 0
deal 0
is 0
amended 0
to 0
delete 0
the 0
sunset 0
clauses 0
and 0
expand 0
the 0
inspections 0
regime. 0

Yet 0

even 0
an 0
amended, 0
improved 0
deal 0
will 0
still 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
shield 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
program. 0

An 0
improved 0
deal 1
won’t 1
destroy 1
Iran’s 0
centrifuges. 0

It 1

won’t 1
take 0
away 0
Iran’s 0
enriched 0
uranium. 0

It 1
won’t 1
destroy 1
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
installations. 0

And 0
it 1
won’t 1
bring 1
down 0
the 0
regime 0
which 0
by 0
its 0
nature 0
ensures 0
all 0
of 0
these 0
things 0
will 0
remain 0
a 1
menace 1
to 1
the 1
US, 1
its 1
allies 1
and 1
international 1
security 1
as 1
a 1
whole. 1

So 0

long 0
as 0
the 0
US 0
continues 0
to 0
maintain 0
a 0
policy 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
false 0
view 0
that 0
all 0
that 0
is 0
necessary 0
to 0
destroy 0
the 0
threat 0
of 0
a 0
nuclear 0
armed 0
Iran 0
is 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
and 0
economic 0
sanctions, 0
it 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
nuclear 0
program 0
remain 0
a 0
major 0
threat. 0

Distressingly, 0
US 0
Ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
Nikki 0
Haley, 0
the 1
most 1
outspoken 1
supporter 1
of 0
decertifying 0
Iranian 0
compliance 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration, 0
told 0
NBC 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
intends 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

To 0

understand 0
what 0
must 0
be 0
done 0
we 0
must 0
return 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
speech 0
and 0
its 0
strategic 0
significance. 0

By 0

taking 0
a 0
holistic 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
Iranian 0
threat 0
– 0
grounded 0
in 0
a 0
recognition 0
of 0
the 0
inherent 0
hostility 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
– 0
Trump 0
opened 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
its 0
allies 0
can 0
develop 0
a 0
holistic 0
policy 0
for 0
confronting 0
and 0
defeating 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
proxies. 0

If 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal 0
and 0
sanctions 0
are 0
two 0
components 0
to 0
a 0
larger 0
strategy 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
entire 0
strategy, 0
they 0
can 0
be 0
helpful. 0

A 0

wider 0
strategy 0
would 0
target 0
Iran’s 0
regional 0
aggression 0
by 0
weakening 0
its 0
proxies 0
and 0
clients 0
from 0
Hezbollah 0
and 0
Hamas 0
to 0
the 0
regimes 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Yemen, 0
Syria 0
and 0
Lebanon. 0

It 0
would 0
target 0
the 0
regime 0
itself 0
by 0
empowering 0
the 0
ayatollahs’ 0
domestic 0
opponents. 0

It 0
would 0
pin 0
down 0
Iranian 0
forces 0
by 0
arming 0
and 0
otherwise 0
assisting 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
Kurds 0
to 0
defend 0
and 0
maintain 0
their 0
control 0
over 0
their 0
territory 0
along 0
the 0
Iranian 0
border 0
while 0
strengthening 0
the 0
ties 0
between 0
Iranian 0
Kurds 0
and 0
Iraqi 0
Kurds. 0

Friday, 0

Trump 0
created 0
the 0
possibility 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
strategy. 0

It 0
is 0
up 0
to 0
members 0
of 0
Congress, 0
and 0
US 0
allies 0
like 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Sunni 0
Arab 0
states 0
to 0
help 0
Trump 0
conceive 0
and 0
implement 0
it. 0

If 1
they 1
fail, 1
the 1
possibility 1
Trump 1
created 1
will 1
be 1
lost, 1
perhaps 1
irrevocably. 1
