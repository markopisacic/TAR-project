however, 0 395 5
said 0 395 5
he 0 395 5
understood 0 395 5
why 0 395 5
the 0 395 5
students 0 395 5
felt 0 395 5

a 0 395 6

to 0 395 6

saying 0 395 6
he 0 395 6
could 0 395 6
not 0 395 6
determine 0 395 6
if 0 395 6
the 0 395 6
vote 0 395 6
was 0 395 6
motivated 0 395 6
by 0 395 6
anti-Semitism, 0 395 6
but 0 395 6
he 0 395 6
acknowledged 0 395 6
there 0 395 6
were 0 395 6
“in 0 395 6

initially 0 395 7
upset 0 395 7
with 0 395 7
the 0 395 7

but 0 395 7
felt 0 395 7
vindicated 0 395 7
by 0 395 7
Boudreau’s 0 395 7
clarification. 0 395 7

“I 0 395 8
thought 0 395 8
this 0 395 8
acknowledgement 0 395 8
was 0 395 8
very 0 395 8
important 0 395 8

I 0 395 8
really 0 395 8
did 0 395 8
appreciate 0 395 8
that 0 395 8

were 0 395 10
deemed 0 395 10

pro-Israel, 0 395 10
alleging 1 395 10
“layers 1 395 10

within 1 395 10
the 1 395 10

concluded. 0 395 12

Lew 0 395 13
said 0 395 13
he 0 395 13
feels 0 395 13
vindicated 0 395 13
to 0 395 13
some 0 395 13
extent, 0 395 13
but 0 395 13
is 0 395 13
concerned 0 395 13

“There 0 395 14
