The 0
McGill 0
student 0
at 0
the 0
centre 0
of 0
anti-Semitic 0
allegations 0
says 0
he’s 0
certain 0
the 0
climate 0
within 0
student 0
government 0
will 0
improve, 0
after 0
a 0
report 0
into 0
the 0
incident 0
was 0
made 0
public 0
this 0
week. 0

Noah 0
Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
students 0
were 0
voted 0
off 0
the 0
Students’ 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
last 0
October 0
after 0
they 0
were 0
identified 0
as 0
having 0
pro-Israel 0
viewpoints. 0

They 0
were 0
since 0
reinstated. 0

A 0
report 0
made 0
public 0
this 0
week 0
by 0
Spencer 0
Boudreau 0
concluded 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
determine 0
if 0
students 0
who 0
organized 0
against 0
the 0
three 0
board 0
members 0
had 0
anti-Semitic 0
intentions. 0

Boudreau, 0
a 0
retired 0
professor 0
of 0
education 0
and 0
former 0
ombudsperson 0
for 0
students, 0
however, 0
said 0
he 0
understood 0
why 0
the 0
students 0
felt 0
they 0
were 0
targeted 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
Jewish. 0

After 0
criticism 0
from 0
several 0
Jewish 0
groups 0
both 0
on 0
and 0
off 0
campus, 0
Boudreau 0
issued 0
a 0
clarification 0
to 0
the 0
report, 0
saying 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
determine 0
if 0
the 0
vote 0
was 0
motivated 0
by 0
anti-Semitism, 0
but 0
he 0
acknowledged 0
there 0
were 0
“in 0
fact 0
anti-Semitic 0
effects 0
felt 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Jewish 0
community.” 0

Speaking 0
to 0
the 0
Montreal 0
Gazette 0
on 0
Friday, 0
Lew, 0
the 0
SSMU’s 0
vice-president 0
of 0
finance 0
for 0
the 0
Arts, 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
initially 0
upset 0
with 0
the 0
report, 0
but 0
felt 0
vindicated 0
by 0
Boudreau’s 0
clarification. 0

“I 0
thought 0
this 0
acknowledgement 0
was 0
very 0
important 0
and 0
I 0
really 0
did 0
appreciate 0
that 0
he 0
clarified 0
the 0
matter,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Jewish 0
groups 0
had 0
criticized 0
Boudreau’s 0
report, 0
saying 0
it 0
ignored 0
anti-Semitic 0
language 0
used 0
on 0
Facebook 0
by 0
a 0
group 0
called 0
Democratize 0
SSMU. 0

The 0
group 0
was 0
urging 0
students 0
to 0
vote 0
against 0
Lew, 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
board 0
members 0
who 0
were 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
pro-Israel, 0
alleging 1
“layers 1
of 1
corruption” 1
within 1
the 1
student 1
government 1
and 1
favouritism 1
in 1
appointing 1
board 1
members, 1
then 0
singled 0
out 0
three 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
board 0
“who 0
are 0
all 0
either 0
fellows 0
at 0
the 0
Canadian 0
Jewish 0
Political 0
Affairs 0
Committee, 0
an 0
organization 0
whose 0
explicit 0
mandate 0
is 0
to 0
promote 0
pro-Israel 0
discourse 0
in 0
Canadian 0
politics, 0
or 0
primary 0
organizers 0
for 0
the 0
anti-BDS 0
initiative 0
at 0
McGill.” 0

Boudreau 0
made 0
his 0
clarification 0
after 0
it 0
was 0
pointed 0
out 0
the 0
anti-Semitic 0
language 0
was 0
published 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
vote. 0

While 0
Democratize 0
SSMU 0
later 0
apologized 0
for 0
the 0
language 0
and 0
deleted 0
it 0
from 0
its 0
site, 0
the 0
damage 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
done, 0
Boudreau 0
concluded. 0

Lew 0
said 0
he 0
feels 0
vindicated 0
to 0
some 0
extent, 0
but 0
is 0
concerned 0
anti-Semitism 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
problem 0
within 0
student 0
government. 0

“There 0
have 0
been 0
some 0
steps 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
administration 0
and 0
the 0
student 0
body 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction, 0
but 0
it’s 0
certainly 0
not 0
over,” 0
he 0
said. 0

In 0
the 0
months 0
leading 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
vote, 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
other 0
anti-Semitic 0
incidents, 0
including 0
a 0
tweet 0
by 0
Igor 0
Sadikov, 0
an 0
elected 0
representative 0
of 0
students 0
in 0
McGill’s 0
faculty 0
of 0
arts, 0
saying: 0
“punch 1
a 1
zionist.” 1

Among 0
the 0
measures 0
taken 0
by 0
SSMU 0
after 0
the 0
October 0
vote 0
was 0
the 0
creation 0
of 0
a 0
committee 0
looking 0
into 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
anti-Semitism 0
within 0
the 0
student 0
government, 0
which 0
Lew 0
sits 0
on. 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
McGill 0
Principal 0
Suzanne 0
Fortier 0
said 0
the 0
University 0
wants 0
to 0
ensure 0
a 0
safe 0
space 0
for 0
all 0
students. 0

“I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
take 0
this 0
opportunity 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
there 1
is 1
absolutely 1
no 1
place 1
for 0
anti-Semitism 0
at 0
McGill 0
University 0
and 0
that, 0
as 0
principal 0
and 0
vice-chancellor, 0
I 0
will 0
remain 0
vigilant 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
all 0
members 0
of 0
our 0
community 0
feel 0
safe, 0
welcomed 0
and 0
respected 0
on 0
our 0
campuses.” 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
ordering 0
the 0
report, 0
Fortier 0
set 0
up 0
a 0
hotline 0
to 0
report 0
incidents 0
of 0
of 0
intolerance 0
and 0
a 0
task 0
force 0
to 0
investigate 0
incidents 0
of 0
academic 0
freedom 0
and 0
equity. 0

Rabbi 0
Reuben 0
Poupko, 0
the 0
co-chair 0
for 0
Quebec 0
of 0
the 0
Centre 0
for 0
Israel 0
and 0
Jewish 0
Affairs, 0
said 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
McGill 0
in 0
general 0
is 0
a 0
safe 0
space 0
for 0
Jewish 0
students. 0

However, 1
he 1
said 1
any 1
Jewish 1
students 1
thinking 1
of 1
being 1
involved 1
in 1
student 1
politics 1
or 1
activism 1
“will 1
have 1
encounters 1
that 1
are 1
profoundly 1
disturbing 1
and 1
unpleasant.” 1

He 1
said 1
McGill 1
is 1
not 1
alone 1
in 1
this 1
respect, 1
as 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
continent-wide 1
phenomenon 1
within 1
student 1
politics. 1

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
did 0
not 0
respond 0
to 0
a 0
request 0
for 0
an 0
interview. 0
