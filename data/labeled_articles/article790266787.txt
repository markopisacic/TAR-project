the 0 276 19

Ramirez 0 276 40
alleges 0 276 40
she 0 276 40
was 0 276 40

by 0 276 40

himself 0 276 41

If 0 276 42

It 0 276 43

a 0 276 43

The 0 276 48

Republicans 0 276 49
considered 0 276 49
the 0 276 49
political 0 276 49
optics 0 276 49

didn’t 0 276 49

prospect 0 276 49
of 0 276 49
their 0 276 49
all-male 1 276 49
team 1 276 49
of 0 276 49
11 0 276 49
senators 0 276 49
questioning 0 276 49
a 0 276 49
woman 0 276 49
so 0 276 49
they 0 276 49
hired 0 276 49
sex-crimes 0 276 49

Rachel 0 276 49

of 0 276 49
Maricopa 0 276 49
County, 0 276 49
Arizona, 0 276 49
to 0 276 49

the 0 276 49
questions 0 276 49
at 0 276 49
what 0 276 49
promises 0 276 49
to 0 276 49
be 0 276 49
a 0 276 49
highly-watched 0 276 49
hearing. 0 276 49

Democrats 0 276 50
predictably 0 276 50
freaked 1 276 50
out 1 276 50
at 0 276 50
the 0 276 50
decision 0 276 50
to 0 276 50
have 0 276 50
a 0 276 50
woman 0 276 50
lead 0 276 50
the 0 276 50
questioning 0 276 50
since 0 276 50
their 0 276 50
primary 0 276 50
objective 0 276 50
here 0 276 50
is 0 276 50
to 0 276 50
embarrass 0 276 50
and 0 276 50
discredit 0 276 50
Kavanaugh 0 276 50
and 0 276 50
other 0 276 50
Republicans, 0 276 50
not 0 276 50
get 0 276 50
at 0 276 50
the 0 276 50
truth. 0 276 50

“It 0 276 51
is 0 276 51
going 0 276 51
against 0 276 51
everything 0 276 51
I’ve 0 276 51
seen 0 276 51
for 0 276 51
44 0 276 51
years," 0 276 51
huffed 0 276 51
committee 0 276 51
member 0 276 51
Patrick 0 276 51
Leahy 0 276 51
(D-Vt.). 0 276 51

"They’re 0 276 52
not 0 276 52
following 0 276 52
normal 0 276 52
procedure." 0 276 52

As 0 276 53
expected, 0 276 53
at 0 276 53
today’s 0 276 53
hearing 0 276 53
Kavanaugh 0 276 53
will 0 276 53
firmly 0 276 53
rebut 0 276 53
the 0 276 53
increasingly 0 276 53
outrageous 0 276 53
claims 0 276 53
being 0 276 53
leveled 0 276 53
at 0 276 53
him. 0 276 53

According 0 276 54
to 0 276 54
prepared 0 276 54
testimony 0 276 54
provided 0 276 54
to 0 276 54
The 0 276 54
Hill 0 276 54
newspaper, 0 276 54
he 0 276 54
will 0 276 54
say: 0 276 54

I 0 276 55
categorically 1 276 55
and 1 276 55
unequivocally 1 276 55
deny 1 276 55
the 0 276 55
allegation 0 276 55
against 0 276 55
me 0 276 55
by 0 276 55
Dr. 0 276 55
Ford. 0 276 55

I 0 276 56
never 0 276 56
had 0 276 56
any 0 276 56
sexual 0 276 56
or 0 276 56
physical 0 276 56
encounter 0 276 56
of 0 276 56
any 0 276 56
kind 0 276 56
with 0 276 56
Dr. 0 276 56
Ford. 0 276 56

I 0 276 57
am 0 276 57
not 0 276 57
questioning 0 276 57
that 0 276 57
Dr. 0 276 57
Ford 0 276 57
may 0 276 57
have 0 276 57
been 0 276 57
sexually 0 276 57
assaulted 0 276 57
by 0 276 57
some 0 276 57
person 0 276 57
in 0 276 57
some 0 276 57
place 0 276 57
at 0 276 57
some 0 276 57
time. 0 276 57

But 0 276 58
I 0 276 58
have 0 276 58
never 0 276 58
done 0 276 58
that 0 276 58
to 0 276 58
her 0 276 58
or 0 276 58
to 0 276 58
anyone. 0 276 58

Kavanaugh 0 276 59
added: 0 276 59
"I 0 276 59
am 0 276 59
innocent 0 276 59
of 0 276 59
this 0 276 59
charge." 0 276 59

Not 0 276 60
surprisingly 0 276 60
Ford’s 0 276 60
prepared 0 276 60
testimony 0 276 60
also 0 276 60
found 0 276 60
its 0 276 60
way 0 276 60
to 0 276 60
reporters. 0 276 60

“I 0 276 61
am 0 276 61
here 0 276 61
today 0 276 61
not 0 276 61
because 0 276 61
I 0 276 61
want 0 276 61
to 0 276 61
be,” 0 276 61
Ford 0 276 61
says 0 276 61
in 0 276 61
her 0 276 61
opening 0 276 61
statement. 0 276 61

“I 0 276 62
am 1 276 62
terrified. 1 276 62

I 0 276 63
am 0 276 63
here 0 276 63
because 0 276 63
I 0 276 63
believe 0 276 63
it 0 276 63
is 0 276 63
my 0 276 63
civic 0 276 63
duty 0 276 63
to 0 276 63
tell 0 276 63
you 0 276 63
what 0 276 63
happened 0 276 63
to 0 276 63
me 0 276 63
while 0 276 63
Brett 0 276 63
Kavanaugh 0 276 63
and 0 276 63
I 0 276 63
were 0 276 63
in 0 276 63
high 0 276 63
school.” 0 276 63

She 0 276 64
describes 0 276 64
the 0 276 64
nominee 0 276 64
as 0 276 64
“Brett 1 276 64
Kavanaugh, 1 276 64
the 1 276 64
boy 1 276 64
who 1 276 64
sexually 1 276 64
assaulted 1 276 64
me,” 1 276 64
and 0 276 64
claims 0 276 64
“Brett’s 0 276 64
assault 0 276 64
on 0 276 64
me 0 276 64
drastically 1 276 64
altered 1 276 64
my 1 276 64
life,” 1 276 64
but 0 276 64
at 0 276 64
the 0 276 64
same 0 276 64
time 0 276 64
acknowledges 0 276 64
“Brett 0 276 64
did 0 276 64
not 0 276 64
rape 0 276 64
me.” 0 276 64

Given 0 276 65
that 0 276 65
Kavanaugh 0 276 65
has 0 276 65
already 0 276 65
passed 0 276 65
six 0 276 65
incredibly 0 276 65
intrusive 0 276 65
FBI 0 276 65
investigations, 0 276 65
odds 0 276 65
are 0 276 65
Ford 1 276 65
is 1 276 65
lying 1 276 65
or 1 276 65
suffering 1 276 65
from 1 276 65
some 1 276 65
kind 1 276 65
of 1 276 65
psychological 1 276 65
disorder 1 276 65
such 1 276 65
as 1 276 65
false 1 276 65
memory 1 276 65
syndrome. 1 276 65

Many 0 276 66
commentators 0 276 66
have 0 276 66
drawn 0 276 66
parallels 0 276 66
between 0 276 66
Ford 0 276 66
and 0 276 66
Anita 0 276 66
Hill, 0 276 66
who 0 276 66
in 0 276 66
1991 0 276 66
accused 0 276 66
then-Supreme 0 276 66
Court 0 276 66
nominee 0 276 66
Clarence 0 276 66
Thomas 0 276 66
of 0 276 66
sexual 0 276 66
improprieties. 0 276 66

Both 0 276 67
women 0 276 67
are 0 276 67
college 0 276 67
professors. 0 276 67

Both 0 276 68
claim 0 276 68
to 0 276 68
have 0 276 68
reluctantly 0 276 68
been 0 276 68
drawn 0 276 68
into 0 276 68
confirmation 0 276 68
battles. 0 276 68

Ford 0 276 69
claims 0 276 69
to 0 276 69
be 0 276 69
a 0 276 69
victim 0 276 69
of 0 276 69
attempted 0 276 69
rape; 0 276 69
Hill 0 276 69
claims 0 276 69
to 0 276 69
have 0 276 69
been 0 276 69
a 0 276 69
victim 0 276 69
of 0 276 69
sexual 0 276 69
harassment 0 276 69
in 0 276 69
