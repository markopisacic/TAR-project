By 0
now, 0
we 0
have 0
all 0
heard 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Campos. 0

He’s 0
the 0
heroic 0
security 0
guard 0
that 0
allegedly 0
located 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
shooter, 0
Steven 0
Paddock. 0

But 0
the 0
narrative 0
surrounding 0
him 0
has 0
changed 0
wildly 0
since 0
the 0
authorities 0
mentioned 0
him, 0
and 0
now, 0
he’s 0
mysteriously 1
vanished 1
into 1
thin 1
air. 1

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
leads 0
many 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
Campos 0
didn’t 0
even 0
exist, 0
to 0
begin 0
with. 0

His 1
mere 1
existence 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
fabricated 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
authorities 1
who 1
are 1
cramming 1
lies 1
down 1
our 1
throats 1
about 1
this 1
massacre 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
political 1
agendas. 1

There 0
are 0
two 0
conflicting 0
timelines 0
of 0
Campos’s 0
injury, 0
but 0
what 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
so 0
far 0
made 0
clear, 0
is 0
that 0
they 1
want 1
the 1
public 1
to 1
believe 1
Campos 0
was 0
walking 0
down 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Hotel 0
& 0
Casino’s 0
32nd 0
floor 0
hallway, 0
when 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
spotted 0
him 0
on 0
a 0
camera 0
he’d 0
allegedly 0
set 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
room 0
service 0
cart, 0
just 0
outside 0
his 0
suite. 0

Once 0
he 0
saw 0
Campos, 0
Paddock 0
reportedly 0
fired 0
nearly 0
200 0
rounds 0
through 0
his 0
suite 0
door, 0
wounding 0
Campos 0
in 0
the 0
leg. 0

Moments 0
later 0
(6 0
minutes 0
actually, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
newly 0
revised 0
timeline 0
regarding 0
Campos) 0
Paddock 0
allegedly 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
a 0
crowd 0
killing 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
and 0
injuring 0
nearly 0
500. 0

But 0
Campos 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
mysterious 0
subject 0
since 0
being 0
wounded 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
moments 0
of 0
Paddock’s 0
assault. 0

After 0
speaking 0
to 0
hotel 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officials, 0
Campos 0
was 0
scheduled 0
to 0
appear 0
on 0
local 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
television 0
for 0
an 0
interview 0
but 0
went 0
missing 0
just 0
moments 0
before 0
he 0
was 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
air. 0

David 0
Hickey, 0

spokesman 0
for 0
the 0
Security, 0
Police, 0
and 0
Fire 0
Professionals 0
of 0
America 0
(SPFPA), 0
Campos’s 0
union, 0
said 0
he 0
got 0
a 0
text 0
that 0
Campos 0
had 0
been 0
taken 0
to 0
an 0
urgent 0
care 0
facility, 0
UMC 0
Quick 0
Care. 0

But 0
UMC 0
Quick 0
Care 0
says 0
none 0
of 0
their 0
clinics 0
filled 0
out 0
an 0
intake 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
patient 0
by 0
that 0
name, 0
and 0
Campos 0
has 0
been 0
silent 0
since 0
the 0
text; 0
vanishing 1
into 1
thin 1
air. 1

He 0
also 0
isn’t 0
listed 0
on 0
the 0
registry 0
that 0
shows 0
the 0
names 0
of 0
licensed 0
security 0
guards 0
in 0
Nevada. 0

“Right 0
now 0
I’m 0
just 0
concerned 0
where 0
my 0
member 0
is, 0
and 0
what 0
his 0
condition 0
is. 0

It’s 0
highly 0
unusual,” 0
Hickey 0
told 0
media. 0

“I’m 0
hoping 0
everything 0
is 0
OK 0
with 0
him 0
and 0
I’m 0
sure 0
MGM 0
or 0
the 0
union 0
will 0
let 0
(media) 0
know 0
when 0
we 0
hear 0
something,” 0
he 0
said. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
authorities 0
still 0
have 0
not 0
released 0
a 0
conclusive 0
timeline 0
for 0
the 0
shooting 0
they 1
desperately 1
want 1
us 1
to 1
believe 1
was 0
committed 0
by 0
Paddock. 0

And, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
latest 0
reports, 0
are 0
still 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
motive 0
for 0
the 0
shooting. 0
