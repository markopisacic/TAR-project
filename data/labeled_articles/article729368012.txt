needed 0 1 20
for 0 1 20
its 0 1 20

program. 0 1 20

At 0 1 21
the 0 1 21
time, 0 1 21
Rosatom 0 1 21
was 0 1 21
seeking 0 1 21
the 0 1 21

Campbell 0 1 25
informed 0 1 25
the 0 1 25
FBI 0 1 25
of 0 1 25
the 0 1 25
close 0 1 25
relationship 0 1 25

both 0 1 25
a 0 1 25
part 0 1 25
of 0 1 25

He 0 1 26
stated 0 1 26
in 0 1 26
his 0 1 26

that 0 1 26
while 0 1 26

with 0 1 26
the 0 1 26
Russian 0 1 26
executives 0 1 26
from 0 1 26
both 0 1 26
Rosatom 0 1 26

that 0 1 26
any 0 1 26
mention 0 1 26
of 0 1 26
“TVEL 0 1 26
is 0 1 26
a 0 1 26

to 0 1 26
all 0 1 26

I 0 1 27
do 0 1 27
not 0 1 27
even 0 1 27

to 0 1 27
our 0 1 27
friends, 0 1 27
but 0 1 27
occasionally 0 1 27
they 0 1 27
speak 0 1 27
of 0 1 27
it 0 1 27
and 0 1 27
always 0 1 27
in 0 1 27
a 0 1 27
guarded 0 1 27
manner.” 0 1 27
In 0 1 27
the 0 1 27

he 0 1 27
informed 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
FBI 0 1 27
that 0 1 27
“occasionally 0 1 27

And 0 1 27
when 0 1 27
he 0 1 27
asked 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
Russians 0 1 27
about 0 1 27
these 0 1 27

consulting. 0 1 28

I 0 1 29
asked 0 1 29
Vadim 0 1 29
(Mikerin) 0 1 29
if 0 1 29
they 0 1 29
felt 0 1 29
there 0 1 29
was 0 1 29
a 0 1 29
serious 0 1 29
problem, 0 1 29
and 0 1 29
would 0 1 29
they 0 1 29
adhere 0 1 29
to 0 1 29
sanctions 0 1 29
and 0 1 29
western 0 1 29
opinion. 0 1 29

His 0 1 30
response 0 1 30
was 0 1 30
a 0 1 30
smile 0 1 30
and 0 1 30
shoulder 0 1 30
shrug.” 0 1 30
But 0 1 30
Campbell 0 1 30
had 0 1 30
provided 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
FBI 0 1 30
with 0 1 30
evidence 0 1 30
of 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
criminal 0 1 30
network 0 1 30
and 0 1 30
delivered 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
information 0 1 30
to 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
FBI, 0 1 30
which 0 1 30
was 0 1 30
monitoring 0 1 30
his 0 1 30
work 0 1 30
as 0 1 30
an 0 1 30
informant 0 1 30
and 0 1 30
approving 0 1 30
his 0 1 30
transfer 0 1 30
of 0 1 30
bribery 0 1 30
money 0 1 30
to 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
Russians. 0 1 30

Those 0 1 31
transfers, 0 1 31
which 0 1 31
were 0 1 31
made 0 1 31
in 0 1 31
bulk 0 1 31
$50,000 0 1 31
sums 0 1 31
and 0 1 31
at 0 1 31
times 0 1 31
delivered 0 1 31
in 0 1 31
cash, 0 1 31
occurred 0 1 31
between 0 1 31
senior 0 1 31
executives 0 1 31
of 0 1 31
the 0 1 31
American 0 1 31
transportation 0 1 31
company 0 1 31
and 0 1 31
the 0 1 31
Russian 0 1 31
executives 0 1 31
connected 0 1 31
to 0 1 31
Rosatom. 0 1 31

He 0 1 32
had 0 1 32
given 0 1 32
the 0 1 32
FBI 0 1 32
irrefutable 0 1 32
evidence 0 1 32
showing 0 1 32
how 0 1 32
contracts 0 1 32
obtained 0 1 32
from 0 1 32
the 0 1 32
same 0 1 32
Russian 0 1 32

were 0 1 32
based 0 1 32
on 0 1 32
contract 0 1 32
bribery 0 1 32
and 0 1 32
other 0 1 32
nefarious 0 1 32
actions, 0 1 32
he 0 1 32
said. 0 1 32

Senior 0 1 33
members 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
the 0 1 33
FBI, 0 1 33
Department 0 1 33

Treasury, 0 1 33

of 0 1 33
Energy 0 1 33
and 0 1 33
Department 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
Justice 0 1 33
were 0 1 33
also 0 1 33
briefed 0 1 33
on 0 1 33
Campbell’s 0 1 33
information 0 1 33
and 0 1 33
were 0 1 33
apprised 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
the 0 1 33
various 0 1 33
facets 0 1 33
pertaining 0 1 33
to 0 1 33
Russia’s 0 1 33
acquisition 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
the 0 1 33
Canadian 0 1 33
company. 0 1 33

In 0 1 34
fact, 0 1 34
Campbell 0 1 34
had 0 1 34
been 0 1 34
told 0 1 34
by 0 1 34
his 0 1 34
FBI 0 1 34
handlers 0 1 34
that 0 1 34
his 0 1 34
work 0 1 34
had 0 1 34
made 0 1 34
it 0 1 34
at 0 1 34
least 0 1 34
twice 0 1 34
into 0 1 34
President 0 1 34
Obama’s 0 1 34
classified 0 1 34
presidential 0 1 34
daily 0 1 34
briefings. 0 1 34

Of 1 1 35
course, 1 1 35
we 1 1 35
know 1 1 35
what 1 1 35
Obama 1 1 35
did 1 1 35
with 1 1 35
his 1 1 35
daily 1 1 35
briefings. 1 1 35

They 1 1 36
are 1 1 36
somewhere 1 1 36
in 1 1 36
the 1 1 36
White 1 1 36
House 1 1 36
sewer 1 1 36
system. 1 1 36

Campbell's 0 1 37
work 0 1 37
has 0 1 37
resulted 0 1 37
in 0 1 37
real 0 1 37
justice 0 1 37
being 0 1 37
administered. 0 1 37

In 0 1 38
January, 0 1 38
I 0 1 38
reported: 0 1 38

On 0 1 39
Friday, 0 1 39
the 0 1 39
Justice 0 1 39

concerning 0 1 39
the 0 1 39
Uranium 0 1 39
One 0 1 39
scandal. 0 1 39

Sadly, 0 1 40
it 0 1 40
did 0 1 40
not 0 1 40
include 0 1 40
former 0 1 40
Secretary 0 1 40
of 0 1 40
State 0 1 40
Hillary 0 1 40

Maryland. 0 1 40

Lambert, 0 1 41

was 0 1 41
charged 0 1 41
with 0 1 41
one 0 1 41

Foreign 0 1 41
Corrupt 0 1 41

(FCPA) 0 1 41
and 0 1 41
to 0 1 41
commit 0 1 41

seven 0 1 41

The 0 1 42
charges 0 1 42

When 0 1 59
it 0 1 59
emerged 0 1 59
that 0 1 59
Campbell 0 1 59
had 0 1 59
evidence 0 1 59
against 0 1 59
the 0 1 59
Clinton 0 1 59
Foundation, 0 1 59

(of 0 1 59

slammed 0 1 59
Campbell 0 1 59
as 0 1 59
a 0 1 59
"disaster" 1 1 59
potential 1 1 59
witness 1 1 59

All 0 1 60
of 0 1 60
this 0 1 60
then 0 1 60
goes 0 1 60
back 0 1 60
to 0 1 60
things 0 1 60
we 0 1 60
have 0 1 60
pointed 0 1 60
out 0 1 60
with 0 1 60
ranchers 0 1 60
in 0 1 60
the 0 1 60
western 0 1 60
united 0 1 60
States 0 1 60
and 0 1 60
how 0 1 60
this 0 1 60
impacts 0 1 60
them, 0 1 60
as 0 1 60
well 0 1 60
as 0 1 60
the 0 1 60
land 0 1 60
grabs 0 1 60
that 0 1 60
are 0 1 60
unconstitutionally 0 1 60
orchestrated 0 1 60
by 0 1 60
the 0 1 60
DC 0 1 60
government 0 1 60
and 0 1 60
the 0 1 60
Bureau 0 1 60
of 0 1 60
Land 0 1 60
Management. 0 1 60

There 0 1 61
is 0 1 61
also 0 1 61
substantial 0 1 61
documentation 0 1 61
that 0 1 61
was 0 1 61
discovered 0 1 61
in 0 1 61
Oregon 0 1 61
that 0 1 61
relates 0 1 61
to 0 1 61
this 0 1 61
deal 0 1 61
during 0 1 61
the 0 1 61
Oregon 0 1 61
occupation 0 1 61
in 0 1 61
2016, 0 1 61
which 0 1 61
got 0 1 61
zero 0 1 61
coverage 0 1 61
in 0 1 61
the 0 1 61
mainstream 0 1 61
media. 0 1 61

Are 0 1 62
we 0 1 62
about 0 1 62
to 0 1 62
see 0 1 62
a 0 1 62
serious 0 1 62
shakedown 0 1 62
in 0 1 62
all 0 1 62
of 0 1 62
this? 0 1 62

Time 0 1 63
will 0 1 63
tell, 0 1 63
but 0 1 63
I 0 1 63
remain 0 1 63
skeptical, 0 1 63
as 0 1 63
in 0 1 63
the 0 1 63
end, 0 1 63
all 0 1 63
we 0 1 63
ever 0 1 63
get 0 1 63
is 0 1 63
excuses 0 1 63
rather 0 1 63
than 0 1 63
justice. 0 1 63
