is 0 67 26
serious 0 67 26
to 0 67 26
all 0 67 26
when 0 67 26
mentioned. 0 67 26

I 0 67 27
do 0 67 27
not 0 67 27
even 0 67 27
raise 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
subject 0 67 27
of 0 67 27
TVEL 0 67 27
to 0 67 27
our 0 67 27
friends, 0 67 27
but 0 67 27
occasionally 0 67 27
they 0 67 27
speak 0 67 27
of 0 67 27
it 0 67 27
and 0 67 27
always 0 67 27
in 0 67 27
a 0 67 27
guarded 0 67 27
manner.” 0 67 27
In 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
briefs, 0 67 27
he 0 67 27
informed 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
FBI 0 67 27
that 0 67 27
“occasionally 0 67 27
someone 0 67 27
will 0 67 27
mention 0 67 27
having 0 67 27
been 0 67 27
in 0 67 27
Iran 0 67 27
but 0 67 27
usually 0 67 27
it 0 67 27
is 0 67 27
long 0 67 27
after 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
fact.” 0 67 27
And 0 67 27
when 0 67 27
he 0 67 27
asked 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
Russians 0 67 27
about 0 67 27
these 0 67 27
connections, 0 67 27
he 0 67 27
stated 0 67 27
that 0 67 27
they 0 67 27
“occasionally 0 67 27
speak 0 67 27
of 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
relationship, 0 67 27
i.e. 0 67 27

equipment, 0 67 28
consulting. 0 67 28

I 0 67 29
asked 0 67 29
Vadim 0 67 29
(Mikerin) 0 67 29
if 0 67 29
they 0 67 29
felt 0 67 29
there 0 67 29
was 0 67 29
a 0 67 29
serious 0 67 29
problem, 0 67 29
and 0 67 29
would 0 67 29
they 0 67 29
adhere 0 67 29
to 0 67 29
sanctions 0 67 29
and 0 67 29
western 0 67 29
opinion. 0 67 29

His 0 67 30
response 0 67 30
was 0 67 30
a 0 67 30
smile 0 67 30
and 0 67 30
shoulder 0 67 30
shrug.” 0 67 30
But 0 67 30
Campbell 0 67 30
had 0 67 30
provided 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
FBI 0 67 30
with 0 67 30
evidence 0 67 30
of 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
criminal 0 67 30
network 0 67 30
and 0 67 30
delivered 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
information 0 67 30
to 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
FBI, 0 67 30
which 0 67 30
was 0 67 30
monitoring 0 67 30
his 0 67 30
work 0 67 30
as 0 67 30
an 0 67 30
informant 0 67 30
and 0 67 30
approving 0 67 30
his 0 67 30
transfer 0 67 30
of 0 67 30
bribery 0 67 30
money 0 67 30
to 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
Russians. 0 67 30

Those 0 67 31
transfers, 0 67 31
which 0 67 31
were 0 67 31
made 0 67 31
in 0 67 31
bulk 0 67 31
$50,000 0 67 31
sums 0 67 31
and 0 67 31
at 0 67 31
times 0 67 31
delivered 0 67 31
in 0 67 31
cash, 0 67 31
occurred 0 67 31
between 0 67 31
senior 0 67 31
executives 0 67 31
of 0 67 31
the 0 67 31
American 0 67 31

Russian 0 67 31
executives 0 67 31
connected 0 67 31
to 0 67 31

He 0 67 32
had 0 67 32
given 0 67 32
the 0 67 32
FBI 0 67 32
irrefutable 0 67 32
evidence 0 67 32
showing 0 67 32
how 0 67 32
contracts 0 67 32
obtained 0 67 32
from 0 67 32
the 0 67 32
same 0 67 32

based 0 67 32
on 0 67 32
contract 0 67 32
bribery 0 67 32
and 0 67 32
other 0 67 32
nefarious 0 67 32
actions, 0 67 32
he 0 67 32
said. 0 67 32

Senior 0 67 33
members 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
the 0 67 33
FBI, 0 67 33
Department 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
Treasury, 0 67 33
Department 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
Energy 0 67 33
and 0 67 33
Department 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
Justice 0 67 33
were 0 67 33
also 0 67 33
briefed 0 67 33
on 0 67 33
Campbell’s 0 67 33
information 0 67 33
and 0 67 33
were 0 67 33
apprised 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
the 0 67 33
various 0 67 33
facets 0 67 33
pertaining 0 67 33
to 0 67 33
Russia’s 0 67 33
acquisition 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
the 0 67 33
Canadian 0 67 33
company. 0 67 33

In 0 67 34
fact, 0 67 34
Campbell 0 67 34
had 0 67 34
been 0 67 34
told 0 67 34
by 0 67 34
his 0 67 34
FBI 0 67 34
handlers 0 67 34
that 0 67 34
his 0 67 34
work 0 67 34
had 0 67 34
made 0 67 34
it 0 67 34
at 0 67 34

twice 0 67 34
into 0 67 34

Obama’s 0 67 34

daily 0 67 34
briefings. 0 67 34

Of 1 67 35
course, 1 67 35
we 1 67 35
know 1 67 35
what 1 67 35
Obama 1 67 35
did 1 67 35
with 1 67 35
his 1 67 35
daily 1 67 35
briefings. 1 67 35

They 1 67 36
are 1 67 36

Campbell's 0 67 37
work 0 67 37
has 0 67 37
resulted 0 67 37
in 0 67 37
real 0 67 37
justice 0 67 37
being 0 67 37
administered. 0 67 37

In 0 67 38
