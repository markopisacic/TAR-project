how 0
the 0

took 0
place, 0
but 0
the 0

the 0

which 0
are 0
that 0

out 1

The 0
White 0
House 0
did 0
not 0
immediately 0
respond 0
to 0
a 0
request 0
for 0
comment. 0

Last 0
week, 0
Acosta’s 0
press 0
pass 0
to 0
access 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
was 0
suspended 0
“until 0
further 0
notice” 0
after 0
he 0
engaged 0
in 0
the 0
contentious 0
back-and-forth 0
over 0
the 0
migrant 0
caravan 0
working 0
its 0
way 0
up 0
through 0
Mexico. 0

Trump 0
characterizes 0
the 0
caravan 0
as 0
“an 1
invasion,” 1
a 0
term 0
to 0
which 0
Acosta 0
objected. 0

“Honestly, 0
I 0
think 0
you 0
should 0
let 0
me 0
run 0
the 0
country 0
and 0
you 0
run 0
CNN,” 0
the 0
president 0
said. 0

The 0
reporter 0
tried 0
to 0
ask 0
him 0
another 0
question 0
before 0
a 0
female 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
walked 0
over 0
to 0
him. 0

Trump 0
then 0
told 0
him, 0
“That’s 0
enough!” 0

Acosta 0
continued 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
talk 0
as 0
the 0
intern 0
was 0
seen 0
trying 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
microphone 0
from 0
his 0
hand. 0

She 0
grabbed 0
the 0
microphone 0
but 0
Acosta 0
wouldn’t 0
give 0
it 0
up 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
brief 0
contact 0
between 0
the 0
two. 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
said 0
the 0
suspension 0
of 0
his 0
press 0
credentials 0
stemmed 0
from 0
his 0
“placing 0
his 0
hands 0
on 0
a 0
young 0
woman 0
just 0
trying 0
to 0
do 0
her 0
job 0
as 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
intern.” 0
She 0
called 0
the 0
behavior 0
“absolutely 1
unacceptable.” 1

Several 0
news 0
outlets 0
accused 0
Sanders 0
of 0
using 0
a 0
“doctored” 0
video 0
as 0
evidence, 0
but 0
the 0
press 0
secretary 0
didn’t 0
back 0
down 0
from 0
her 0
decision. 0

“We 0
stand 0
by 0
our 0
decision 0
to 0
revoke 0
this 0
individual’s 0
hard 0
pass. 0

We 0
will 0
not 0
tolerate 0
the 0
inappropriate 1
behavior 0
clearly 0
documented 0
in 0
this 0
video,” 0
Sanders 0
tweeted 0
to 0
accompany 0
the 0
allegedly 0
doctored 0
video. 0

White 0
House 0
Counselor 0
Kellyanne 0
Conway 0
has 0
since 0
said 0
the 0
video 0
was 0
simply 0
“sped 0
up.” 0

An 0
attorney 0
for 0
CNN 0
and 0
Acosta 0
followed 0
up 0
with 0
a 0
separate 0
statement, 0
saying 0
the 0
law 0
is 0
“clear” 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
violated 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
and 0
Due 0
process 0
Clause. 0
