During 0 401 3

that 0 401 3

of 1 401 13
Islam,” 1 401 13
said 1 401 13
that 1 401 13
while 1 401 13
estimates 1 401 13
ranged 1 401 13
wildly 1 401 13
about 1 401 13
how 1 401 13
many 1 401 13
bona 1 401 13

members 1 401 13
belonged 1 401 13
to 1 401 13
the 1 401 13
Nation, 1 401 13
he 1 401 13
believes 1 401 13
that 1 401 13

were 1 401 13
tens 1 401 13

early 1 401 13
1970s. 1 401 13

But 1 401 14
he 1 401 14
said 1 401 14
that 1 401 14
millions 1 401 14

with 1 401 14

in 0 401 16
1933, 0 401 16
Mr. 0 401 16
Farrakhan 0 401 16
joined 0 401 16
the 0 401 16
Nation 0 401 16
of 0 401 16
Islam 0 401 16
in 0 401 16
the 0 401 16
mid-1950s 0 401 16
and 0 401 16
rose 0 401 16
quickly 0 401 16
within 0 401 16
the 0 401 16
organization, 0 401 16
becoming 0 401 16
close 0 401 16
to 0 401 16
Malcolm 0 401 16
X. 0 401 16

After 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
assassination 0 401 17
of 0 401 17
Malcolm 0 401 17
X 0 401 17
in 0 401 17
1965, 0 401 17
he 0 401 17
became 0 401 17
one 0 401 17
of 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
most 0 401 17
powerful 0 401 17
members 0 401 17
of 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
Nation 0 401 17
and 0 401 17
its 0 401 17
chief 0 401 17
spokesman, 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
position 0 401 17
that 0 401 17
Malcolm 0 401 17
X 0 401 17
had 0 401 17
held. 0 401 17

The 0 401 18
Nation 0 401 18
of 0 401 18
Islam 0 401 18
had 0 401 18
gained 0 401 18
followers 0 401 18
around 0 401 18
the 0 401 18
nation 0 401 18
in 0 401 18
the 0 401 18
1940s 0 401 18
and 0 401 18
’50s 0 401 18
by 0 401 18
providing 0 401 18
something 0 401 18
of 0 401 18
a 0 401 18
religious 0 401 18
answer 0 401 18
to 0 401 18
antiblack 0 401 18
racism. 0 401 18

It 0 401 19
was 0 401 19
not 0 401 19
widely 0 401 19
recognized 0 401 19
as 0 401 19
an 0 401 19
anti-Jewish 0 401 19
organization 0 401 19
during 0 401 19
its 0 401 19
early 0 401 19
years 0 401 19
(its 0 401 19
early 0 401 19
literature, 0 401 19
though, 0 401 19
focused 0 401 19
on 0 401 19
“the 1 401 19
white 1 401 19
man” 1 401 19
as 1 401 19
“the 1 401 19
white 1 401 19
devil”). 1 401 19

But 0 401 20
in 0 401 20
1967, 0 401 20
it 0 401 20
became 0 401 20
outspokenly 1 401 20
and 1 401 20
flagrantly 1 401 20
anti-Zionist, 1 401 20
in 0 401 20
an 0 401 20
expression 0 401 20
of 0 401 20
solidarity 0 401 20
with 0 401 20
Palestinians. 0 401 20

That 0 401 21
political 0 401 21
position 0 401 21
became 0 401 21
a 0 401 21
vehicle 0 401 21
for 0 401 21
Mr. 0 401 21
Farrakhan 0 401 21
to 0 401 21
express 0 401 21
his 0 401 21
anti-Semitism. 0 401 21

(Among 0 401 22
his 0 401 22
more 0 401 22
infamous 0 401 22
comments 0 401 22
is 0 401 22
his 1 401 22
1984 1 401 22
description 1 401 22
of 1 401 22
Adolf 1 401 22
Hitler 1 401 22
as 1 401 22
“a 1 401 22
very 1 401 22
great 1 401 22
man.”) 1 401 22

In 0 401 23
1975, 0 401 23
when 0 401 23
Elijah 0 401 23
Muhammad 0 401 23
died, 0 401 23
the 0 401 23
Nation 0 401 23
split 0 401 23
into 0 401 23
two 0 401 23
factions. 0 401 23

The 0 401 24
faction 0 401 24
reconstituted 0 401 24
under 0 401 24
Mr. 0 401 24
Farrakhan 0 401 24
in 0 401 24
the 0 401 24
late 0 401 24
1970s 0 401 24
retained 0 401 24
the 0 401 24
original 0 401 24
name, 0 401 24
though 0 401 24
not 0 401 24
the 0 401 24
influence 0 401 24
or 0 401 24
support 0 401 24
that 0 401 24
it 0 401 24
had 0 401 24
when 0 401 24
its 0 401 24
leaders 0 401 24
were 0 401 24

and 0 401 24
Elijah 0 401 24
Muhammad. 0 401 24

Mr. 0 401 25
Curtis 0 401 25
said 0 401 25
that 0 401 25
today 0 401 25
the 0 401 25

could 0 401 25
be 0 401 25

the 0 401 25
thousands, 0 401 25
and 0 401 25
there 0 401 25
could 0 401 25
even 0 401 25
be 0 401 25
as 0 401 25
many 0 401 25
as 0 401 25
10,000 0 401 25

Mr. 0 401 26

is 0 401 26
“virtually 0 401 26
synonymous 0 401 26
with 0 401 26
anti-Semitism,” 0 401 26
then 0 401 26
drew 0 401 26
national 0 401 26
attention 0 401 26
in 0 401 26
1984, 0 401 26
when 0 401 26

In 0 401 27
a 0 401 27
