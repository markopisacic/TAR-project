Last 0
week, 0
a 0
San 0
Francisco 0
jury 0
acquitted 0
seven-time 0
felon 0
Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate, 0
a 0
repeatedly 0
deported 0
Mexican 0
national, 0
of 0
all 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges 0
in 0
the 0
July 0
1, 0
2015, 0
fatal 0
shooting 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle 0
as 0
she 0
walked 0
with 0
her 0
father 0
and 0
a 0
friend 0
on 0
Pier 0
14. 0

The 0
jury 0
found 0
the 0
confessed 0
shooter 0
guilty 0
only 0
of 0
felony 0
gun 0
possession. 0

Many 0
observers 0
decried 0
the 0
verdict 0
as 0
a 0
travesty 0
of 0
justice, 0
but 0
they 0
were 0
mistaken 0
if 0
they 0
thought 0
it 0
could 0
not 0
get 0
any 0
worse. 0

San 0
Francisco 0
public 0
defender 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
now 0
seeks 0
to 0
have 0
Zarate’s 0
gun 0
possession 0
charge 0
dismissed. 0

Gonzalez 0
is 0
contending 0
the 0
jury 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
told 0
that 0
“momentary” 0
possession 0
of 0
a 0
gun 0
is 0
not 0
necessarily 0
a 0
crime. 0

“If 0
you 0
possess 0
it 0
just 0
to 0
dispose 0
of 0
it 0
or 0
abandon 0
it, 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
a 0
crime,” 0
Gonzalez 0
told 0
reporters. 0

The 0
Steinle 0
family 0
and 0
relatives 0
of 0
murder 0
victims 0
have 0
new 0
cause 0
for 0
outrage, 0
but 0
this 0
gambit 0
is 0
consistent 0
with 0
Gonzalez 0
and 0
the 1
San 1
Francisco 1
show-trial 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
co-starred. 1

Gonzalez 0
hails 0
from 0
McAllen, 0
Texas, 0
and 0
attended 0
Columbia 0
University 0
on 0
a 0
scholarship. 0

As 0
he 0
explained, 0
“I 0
think 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
product 0
of 0
affirmative 0
action,” 0
and 0
ethnic 0
preferences 0
doubtless 0
played 0
a 0
role 0
in 0
admission 0
to 0
Stanford 0
Law 0
School. 0

In 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
Gonzalez 0
became 0
known 0
as 0
“The 1
Great 1
Left 1
Hope,” 1
and 0
a 0
hero 0
to 0
Bay 0
Area 0
radicals. 0

The 0
La 0
Raza 0
Lawyers 0
Association 0
named 0
Gonzalez 0
Lawyer 0
of 0
the 0
Year, 0
and 0
the 0
Mexican 0
American 0
Political 0
Association, 0
a 0
group 0
with 0
roots 0
in 0
the 0
Communist 0
Party, 0
gave 0
him 0
the 0
Bert 0
Corona 0
award, 0
after 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
CPUSA’s 0
most 0
high-profile 0
Stalinists. 0

In 0
2,000, 0
after 0
a 0
decade 0
as 0
a 0
public 0
defender, 0
Gonzalez 0
gained 0
election 0
to 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
Board 0
of 0
Supervisors. 0

In 0
2003, 0
as 0
board 0
president, 0
he 0
commissioned 0
a 0
graffiti 0
artist 0
to 0
spray 0
SMASH 1
THE 1
STATE 1
on 0
his 0
office 0
wall, 0
in 0
“traffic 0
cone 0
orange.” 0
As 0
Gonzalez 0
explained, 0
“This 0
is 0
a 0
sentiment 0
I 0
think 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
have 0
had. 0

You 0
have 0
to 0
rally 0
and 0
find 0
ways 0
of 0
opposing 0
what 0
you 0
don’t 0
like.” 0

In 0
2003 0
Gonzalez 0
ran 0
for 0
mayor 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco 0
but 0
lost 0
to 0
Gavin 0
Newsom. 0

In 0
2008 0
Green 0
Party 0
presidential 0
candidate 0
Ralph 0
Nader 0
tapped 0
Gonzalez 0
for 0
vice 0
president. 0

“He 1
has 1
a 1
great, 1
steadfast 1
commitment 1
to 1
justice,” 1
Nader 0
told 0
reporters. 0

On 0
that 0
score, 0
the 0
Steinle 0
family 0
and 0
other 0
relatives 0
of 0
murder 0
victims 0
have 0
room 0
for 0
reasonable 0
doubt. 0

In 0
jury 0
selection, 0
Gonzalez 0
and 0
the 0
prosecutor, 0
assistant 0
district 0
attorney 0
Diana 0
Garcia, 0
included 0
three 0
“immigrants,” 0
quite 0
possibly 0
false-documented 0
illegals. 0

True 0
to 0
form, 0
judge 0
Samuel 0
Feng 0
sealed 0
the 0
identities 0
of 0
the 0
jurors. 0

So 0
observers 0
have 0
grounds 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
Garcia 0
and 0
Gonzalez 0
both 0
got 0
the 0
jury 0
they 0
wanted. 0

Garcia 0
told 0
the 0
court 0
Zarate 0
was 0
playing 0
his 0
own 0
“secret 1
version 1
of 1
Russian 1
roulette,” 1
and 0
thus 0
parroted 0
the 0
defense’s 0
contention 0
that 0
the 0
shooting 0
was 0
all 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
chance. 0

As 0
it 0
happens, 0
in 0
Russian 0
roulette 0
a 0
shooter 0
loads 0
one 0
bullet 0
into 0
a 0
six-shot 0
revolver, 0
spins 0
the 0
cylinder, 0
then 0
puts 0
the 0
gun 0
to 0
his 0
own 0
head 0
and 0
pulls 0
the 0
trigger. 0

In 0
a 0
central 0
fact 0
of 0
the 0
case, 0
Zarate 0
did 0
not 0
aim 0
the 0
gun 0
at 0
himself 0
but 0
fired 0
in 0
the 0
direction 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle. 0

In 0
another 0
established 0
fact, 0
the 0
bullet 0
struck 0
her 0
in 0
the 0
lower 0
back 0
and 0
tore 0
through 0
her 0
abdominal 0
aorta. 0

This 0
happened 0
in 0
broad 0
daylight, 0
but 0
as 0
in 0
In 0
the 0
Heat 0
of 0
the 0
Night, 0
they 0
had 0
the 0
body 0
which 0
was 0
dead. 0

Garcia 0
Zarate 0
confessed 0
to 0
firing 0
the 0
shot 0
and 0
had 0
gunpowder 0
residue 0
on 0
his 0
hands. 0

After 0
firing, 0
he 0
tossed 0
the 0
gun 0
in 0
the 0
water. 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
found 0
the 0
stolen 0
weapon 0
wrapped 0
in 0
a 0
cloth 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
discharged 0
by 0
itself, 0
both 0
utterly 0
unbelievable 0
claims. 0

Even 0
so, 0
the 0
politically 0
correct 0
jury 0
found 0
the 0
career 0
criminal 0
not 0
guilty 0
of 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter. 0

Any 0
observer 0
could 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
believing 0
that 0
prosecution 0
and 0
defense 0
both 0
got 0
the 0
outcome 0
they 0
wanted. 0

Unlike 1
Stalin’s 1
trials 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
Bolsheviks, 1
and 1
Fidel 1
Castro’ 1
trial 1
of 1
General 1
Arnaldo 1
Ochoa, 1
this 1
show 1
trial 1
aimed 1
to 1
establish 1
innocence 1
for 1
the 1
guilty, 1
and 1
the 1
dynamics 1
of 1
the 1
left 1
were 1
on 1
full 1
display. 1

Denunciations 0
of 0
“gun 0
violence” 0
were 0
nowhere 0
in 0
evidence 0
and 0
expressions 0
of 0
sympathy 0
for 0
the 0
Steinle 0
family 0
proved 0
pathetically 0
weak. 0

As 0
Arthur 0
Koestler 0
said, 0
on 0
the 0
left 0
the 0
truth 0
is 0
spoken 0
with 0
loathing 0
and 0
falsehood 0
with 0
love. 0

On 0
the 0
left, 0
as 0
Orwell 0
had 0
it 0
in 0
Animal 0
Farm, 0
rats 0
are 0
comrades, 0
and 0
criminals 0
are 0
victims 0
of 0
capitalist 0
society. 0

In 0
the 0
view 0
of 0
Gonzalez, 0
society 1
is 1
progressing 1
toward 1
a 1
social 1
justice 1
paradise 1
ruled 1
by 1
a 1
wise 1
elite 1
that 1
knows 1
what’s 1
best 1
for 1
all. 1

In 0
this 0
inexorable 0
progress, 0
determined 0
by 0
history, 0
some 0
people 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
die. 0

As 1
Bertolt 1
Brecht 1
told 1
Sidney 1
Hook 1
about 1
Stalin’s 1
victims, 1
“the 1
more 1
innocent 1
they 1
are, 1
the 1
more 1
they 1
deserve 1
to 1
be 1
shot.” 1

Out 0
for 0
a 0
summer-day 0
walk 0
with 0
her 0
father 0
and 0
a 0
friend, 0
Kate 0
Steinle 0
was 0
a 0
completely 0
innocent 0
victim, 0
gunned 0
down 0
by 0
a 0
career 0
criminal 0
who 0
was 0
not 0
even 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
but 0
found 0
special 0
protection 0
in 0
the 0
sanctuary 0
city 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
sanctuary 0
state 0
of 0
California. 0

As 0
defense 0
attorney 0
Francisco 0
Ugarte 0
said, 0
the 0
verdict 0
was 0
a 0
“vindication 0
for 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
immigrants.” 0

Since 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
mentioned 0
the 0
case, 0
former 0
vice-presidential 0
candidate 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
had 0
to 0
establish 0
the 0
complete 0
innocence 0
of 0
the 0
shooter. 0

That 1
explains 1
the 1
effort 1
of 1
“The 1
Great 1
Left 1
Hope” 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
client’s 1
felony 1
gun 1
possession 1
conviction 1
tossed. 1

Any 0
observer 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
could 0
believe 0
it 0
probably 0
will 0
be. 0
