The 0
Cunning 0
CIA 0

Whatever 0
else 0
might 0
be 0
said 0
about 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
President 0
Kennedy, 0
one 0
thing 0
is 0
for 0
sure: 0
The 1
cover-up 1
of 1
this 1
particular 1
U.S. 1
regime-change 1
operation 1
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
ingenious 1
and 1
cunning 1
plots 1
ever 1
designed. 1

This 0
shouldn’t 0
surprise 0
anyone, 0
given 0
that 0
practically 0
from 0
its 0
inception 0
in 0
1947 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
specializing 0
in 0
the 0
arts 0
of 0
assassination, 0
regime 0
change, 0
and 0
cover-up. 0

As 0
far 0
back 0
as 0
1953, 0
the 0
CIA 0
published 0
an 0
assassination 0
manual 0
that 0
the 1
CIA 1
succeeded 1
in 1
keeping 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
for 0
more 0
than 0
40 0
years. 0

It 0
came 0
to 0
light 0
in 0
1997 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
a 0
Freedom 0
of 0
Information 0
request. 0

That 0
was 0
around 0
the 0
time 0
that 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board, 0
which 0
was 0
overseeing 0
the 0
mandatory 0
release 0
of 0
JFK-related 0
assassination 0
records 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
other 0
federal 0
agencies 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
kept 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
since 1
1963. 1

Today, 0
Americans 0
can 0
read 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
assassination 0
manual 0
online. 0

Titled 0
“Study 0
of 0
Assassination,” 0
the 0
manual 0
spells 0
out 0
various 0
ways 0
to 0
assassinate 0
people. 0

Here 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
manual 0
states 0
in 0
part 0
regarding 0
the 0
use 0
of 0
firearms: 0

Firearms 0
are 0
often 0
used 0
in 0
assassination, 0
often 0
very 0
ineffectively…. 0

Public 0
figures 0
or 0
guarded 0
officials 0
may 0
be 0
killed 0
with 0
great 0
reliability 0
and 0
some 0
safety 0
if 0
a 0
firing 0
point 0
can 0
be 0
established 0
prior 0
to 0
an 0
official 0
occasion. 0

The 0
propaganda 0
value 0
of 0
this 0
system 0
may 0
be 0
very 0
high. 0

Time 0
to 0
buy 0
old 0
US 0
gold 0
coins 0

The 0
manual 0
also 0
makes 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
studying 0
ways 0
to 0
assassinate 0
people 0
without 0
being 0
detected. 0

Note 0
the 0
following 0
excerpt: 0

For 0
secret 0
assassination, 0
either 0
simple 0
or 0
chase, 0
the 0
contrived 0
accident 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
effective 0
technique. 0

When 0
successfully 0
executed, 0
it 0
causes 0
little 0
excitement 0
and 0
is 0
only 0
casually 0
investigated. 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
safe 0
to 0
assume 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
continued 0
developing 0
and 0
expanding 0
on 0
the 0
assassination 0
principles 0
enunciated 0
in 0
that 0
early 0
assassination 0
manual. 0

That’s 0
what 0
we 0
would 0
expect 0
from 0
an 0
agency 0
whose 0
specialties 0
included 0
assassination. 0

We 0
can 0
also 0
assume 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
continued 0
to 0
refine 0
the 0
ways 0
to 0
avoid 0
detection 0
when 0
assassinating 0
someone. 0

The 0
CIA 0
published 0
that 0
secret 0
assassination 0
manual 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
preparations 0
for 0
a 0
U.S. 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
in 0
Guatemala, 0
one 0
that 0
was 0
designed 0
to 0
violently 1
remove 1
the 0
nation’s 0
democratically 0
elected 0
socialist 0
president, 0
Jacobo 0
Arbenz, 0
from 0
office 0
and 0
replace 0
him 0
with 0
an 0
unelected, 1
right-wing, 1
pro-U.S. 1
military 1
general. 1

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Guatemala 0
regime-change 0
operation, 0
the 0
CIA 0
prepared 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
Guatemalan 0
officials 0
to 0
be 0
assassinated. 0

While 0
the 0
CIA 0
has 0
never 0
revealed 0
the 0
names 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
it 0
targeted 0
for 0
assassination, 0
there 0
is 0
little 0
doubt 0
that 0
Arbenz, 0
the 0
president, 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
list. 0

There 0
is 0
something 0
important 0
to 0
note: 0
Neither 0
Arbenz 0
nor 0
any 0
other 0
Guatemalan 0
official 0
had 0
ever 0
attacked 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
even 0
threatened 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

So, 0
why 0
were 0
they 0
targeted 0
for 0
assassination? 0

Because 0
Arbenz 0
had 0
reached 0
out 0
to 0
the 0
Russians 0
and 0
Cubans 0
in 0
a 0
spirit 0
of 0
peace 0
and 0
friendship, 0
just 0
as 0
John 0
Kennedy 0
would 0
do 0
ten 0
years 0
later. 0

That’s 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
targeted 0
Guatemala 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
and 0
why 0
it 0
targeted 0
Arbenz 0
and 0
other 0
Guatemalan 0
officials 0
for 0
assassination. 0

Although 0
Arbenz 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
country, 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
was 0
a 1
total 1
success, 1
with 0
Arbenz 0
being 0
replaced 0
by 0
the 0
pro-U.S. 0
Gen. 0
Carlos 0
Castillo 0
Armas, 0
who 0
proceeded 0
to 0
instigate 0
a 1
reign 1
of 1
terror 1
across 0
Guatemala. 0

The 1
Guatemalan 1
operation 1
was 1
brilliant 1
and 1
ingenious. 1

The 0
CIA 0
officials 0
were 0
secretly 0
honored 0
for 0
protecting 0
“national 0
security” 0
by 0
removing 0
President 0
Arbenz 0
from 0
office 0
and 0
replacing 0
him 0
with 0
a 0
pro-U.S. 0
military 0
general. 0

Tracy 0
Barnes, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
officials 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
operation, 0
was 0
awarded 0
the 0
Distinguished 0
Intelligence 0
Medal, 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
second-highest 0
medal. 0

The 1
CIA’s 1
cover-up 1
in 1
the 1
JFK 1
assassination 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
brilliant 1
and 1
ingenious. 1

The 0
doctors 0
at 0
Parkland 0
Hospital 0
stated 0
that 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
a 0
big 0
exit-sized 0
wound 0
in 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
his 0
head, 0
which 0
implied 0
a 0
shot 0
having 0
been 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front. 0

At 0
a 0
press 0
conference 0
immediately 0
after 0
the 0
president 0
died, 0
two 0
treating 0
physicians 0
stated 0
that 0
the 0
other 0
wound 0
— 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
the 0
front 0
of 0
Kennedy’s 0
neck 0
— 0
was 0
an 0
entry 0
wound, 0
which 0
implied 0
that 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
been 0
hit 0
by 0
another 0
shot 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front. 0

This 0
necessarily 0
meant 0
that 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
been 0
shot 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
not 0
the 0
rear, 0
where 0
accused 0
assassin 0
Lee 0
Harvey 0
Oswald 0
was 0
situated. 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
something 0
important: 0
After 0
he 0
was 0
arrested, 0
Oswald 0
claimed 0
his 0
innocence. 0

But 0
he 0
also 0
went 0
a 0
step 0
further. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
framed 0
for 0
the 0
crime. 0

The 0
obvious 0
question 0
arises: 0
Why 0
frame 0
an 0
innocent 0
man 0
who 0
is 0
situated 0
in 0
the 0
rear 0
by 0
killing 0
the 0
president 0
with 0
shots 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front? 0

Wouldn’t 0
it 0
be 0
more 0
logical 0
to 0
either 0
have 0
the 0
shots 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
rear, 0
where 0
Oswald 0
was, 0
or, 0
alternatively, 0
place 0
Oswald 0
in 0
the 0
front, 0
where 0
the 0
shots 0
were 0
fired? 0

That’s 0
where 0
the 1
brilliance, 1
ingenuity, 1
and 1
cunningness 1
of 1
the 1
cover-up 1
come 0
into 0
play. 0

If 0
Oswald 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
rear 0
and 0
since 0
shots 0
are 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
that 0
could 0
mean 0
only 0
one 0
thing: 0
that 0
Oswald 0
had 0
confederates 0
firing 0
from 0
the 0
front. 0

Who 0
would 0
those 0
confederates 0
be? 0

There 1
could 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
answer: 1
communists. 1

Soviet 1
and 1
Cuban 1
communists, 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
specific. 1

How 0
would 0
we 0
know 0
this? 0

That’s 0
where 0
Oswald’s 0
trip 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City 0
right 0
before 0
the 0
assassination 0
comes 0
into 0
play. 0

Oswald 0
traveled 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City 0
where 0
he 0
purportedly 0
visited 0
the 0
Soviet 0
and 0
Cuban 0
embassies 0
and 0
where 0
he 0
supposedly 0
met 0
with 0
a 0
premier 0
assassin 0
for 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union. 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
the 0
Cold 0
War 0
between 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Cuban 0
Missile 0
Crisis, 0
which 0
brought 0
the 0
world 0
to 0
the 0
brink 0
of 0
nuclear 0
war, 0
had 0
taken 0
place 0
the 0
previous 0
year. 0

So, 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
has 0
been 0
assassinated. 0

Oswald 0
is 0
immediately 0
arrested. 0

He 0
has 0
confederates 0
firing 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
who 1
almost 1
certainly 1
are 1
Soviet 1
and 1
Cuban 1
communists, 1
especially 0
since 0
Oswald 0
has 0
supposedly 0
just 0
recently 0
visited 0
the 0
Soviet 0
and 0
Cuban 0
embassies 0
in 0
Mexico 0
City. 0

What 0
does 0
all 0
that 0
mean? 0

An 0
assassination 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
by 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union 0
and 0
Cuba 0
is 0
obviously 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
war. 0

That 0
means 0
nuclear 0
war 0
is 0
about 0
to 0
break 0
out 0
because 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
that 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
sit 0
idly 0
by 0
when 0
the 1
Reds 1
have 0
just 0
assassinated 0
America’s 0
president. 0

Except 0
for 0
one 0
thing: 0
The 1
communist 1
part 1
and 1
the 1
nuclear-war 1
part 1
were 1
concocted. 1

That 1
was 1
all 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
plan. 1

That 0
was 0
the 1
ingenious 1
way 1
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
assassination 0
squelched 0
just 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
Oswald 0
was 0
murdered. 0

In 0
the 0
early 0
days 0
of 0
the 0
Warren 0
Commission, 0
commission 0
chairman 0
Earl 0
Warren 0
called 0
a 0
top-secret 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
commission. 0

Its 0
purpose 0
was 0
to 0
discuss 0
information 0
that 0
Warren 0
had 0
received 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
actually 0
a 0
U.S. 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
or 0
an 0
informant 0
for 0
the 0
FBI 0
or 0
both. 0

How 0
did 0
Warren 0
resolve 0
this 0
troubling 0
issue? 0

He 0
simply 0
asked 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
FBI 0
whether 0
it 0
was 0
true. 0

They 0
said 0
no. 0

That 0
was 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
matter. 0

The 0
issue 0
was 0
so 0
sensitive 0
that 0
Warren 0
ordered 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
to 1
never 1
reveal 1
the 1
meeting 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

He 0
ordered 0
all 0
notes 0
and 0
other 0
written 0
references 0
to 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

He 0
also 0
ordered 0
the 0
court 0
reporter 0
to 0
destroy 0
her 0
notes 0
of 0
the 0
meeting. 0

Unbeknownst 0
to 0
him, 0
the 0
court 0
reporter 0
inadvertently 0
kept 0
a 0
recording 0
of 0
the 0
meeting 0
that 0
ultimately 0
came 0
to 0
light. 0

This 0
troubling 0
issue 0
arose 0
again 0
yesterday, 0
November 0
2, 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
entitled 0
“Tantalizing 1

In 0
the 0
article, 0
author 0
Ian 0
Shapira 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
among 0
the 0
long-secret 0
CIA 0
records 0
that 0
were 0
recently 0
released 0
was 0
a 0
deposition 0
of 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Richard 0
Helms 0
taken 0
in 0
1975 0
before 0
the 0
President’s 0
Commission 0
on 0
CIA 0
Activities, 0
which 0
stated 0
as 0
follows: 0

BELIN: 0
Well, 0
now, 0
the 0
final 0
area 0
of 0
my 0
interrogation 0
relates 0
to 0
charges 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
in 0
some 0
way 0
conspiratorially 0
involved 0
with 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
President 0
Kennedy. 0

During 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
Warren 0

you 0
were 0

of 0

is 0
that 0
correct? 0

I 0
believe 0
so. 0

BELIN: 0

there 0
any 0
information 0
involved 0
with 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
which 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
shows 0
that 0

That’s 0
where 0
the 0
transcript 0
ends 0
according 0
to 0
few 0
secret 0
records 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
that 0
were 0
recently 0
released 0
by 0
the 0
National 0
Archives. 0

Shapira 0
points 0
out, 0
“Several 0

Shapira 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
Helms’ 0
full 0
deposition 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
public 0

since 0
1994. 0

then 0
proceeds 0
to 0

that 0

I 0
think 0
you 0
may 0
recall 0
this, 0
was 0
raised 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
the 0
Agency 0
was 0
never 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
any 0
evidence 0
whatsoever, 0
and 0
we 0
really 0
searched 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
any 0
contact 0
with 0
Lee 0
Harvey 0
Oswald. 0

As 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
concerned, 0
my 0
recollection 0
is 0
not 0
all 0
that 0
precise. 0

I 0
believe 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Hoover 0
testified 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
been 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
theirs 0
either. 0

He 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
the 0
CIA. 0

He 0
was 0
certainly 0
never 0
used 0
by 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Whether 0
any 0
CIA 0
officer 0
ever 0
talked 0
to 0
him 0
any 0
place 0
or 0
not 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
but 0
I 0
certainly 0
felt 0
quite 0
comfortable 0
— 0
I 0
believe 0
Mr. 0
[John] 0
McCone 0
[a 0
previous 0
CIA 0
director] 0
was 0
asked 0
to 0
testify 0
before 0
the 0
Commission 0
on 0
this 0
point. 0

I 0
believe 0
he 0
was 0
asked 0
to 0
testify. 0

It 0
was 0
a 0
hot 0
item 0
anyway 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

And 0
my 0
recollection 0
is 0
that 0
I 0
informed 0
Mr. 0
McCone 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
find 0
no 0
evidence 0
that 0
Oswald 0
had 0
any 0
connection 0
with 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Shapira 0
ends 0
his 0
article 0
by 0
suggesting 0
that 0
commentators 1
should 1
do 1
more 1
complete 1
research, 1
maybe 1
even 1
use 1
Google, 1
before 1
they 1
jump 1
to 1
conclusions. 1

But 1
Shapira 1
would 1
be 1
wise 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
own 1
advice 1
because 1
he 1
himself 1
is 1
guilty 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
accuses 1
others 1
of. 1

That’s 0
because 0
he 1
failed 1
to 1
conclude 1
his 1
article 1
with 1
one 1
great 1
big 1
important 1
point 1
about 1
former 1
CIA 1
Director 1
Richard 1
Helms. 1

What 0
is 0
that 0
great 1
big 1
important 1
point 1
that 0
Shapira, 0
who, 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
tagline 1
on 1
his 1
article, 1
“enjoys 1
writing 1
about 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
served 1
in 1
the 1
military 1
and 1
intelligence 1
communities,” 1
left 0
out 0
of 0
his 0
article? 0

Perjury. 0

He 0
left 0
out 0
that 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Richard 0
Helms 0
was 0
a 1
perjurer. 1

A 1
liar. 1

A 0
CIA 0
official 0
who 0
would 0
tell 0
falsehoods, 0
even 0
under 0
oath, 0
whenever 0
he 0
felt 0
that 0
“national 0
security” 0
required 0
it. 0

Shapira 1
failed 1
to 1
note 1
that 1
Helms 1
was 1
convicted 1
in 1
a 1
federal 1
district 1
court 1
of 1
lying 1
to 1
Congress 1
under 1
oath 1
about 0
another 0
CIA 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
ten 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
Kennedy 0
assassination 0
in 0
Chile. 0

Interesting 0
enough, 0
in 0
the 0
Chile 0
regime-change 0
operation, 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
the 0
Pentagon 0
were 0
telling 0
their 0
counterparts 0
in 0
the 0
Chilean 0
national-security 0
establishment 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
moral 0
duty 0
to 0
violate 0
their 0
nation’s 0
constitution 0
and 0
violently 1
remove 1
their 0
nation’s 0
democratically 0
elected 0
president, 0
Salvador 0
Allende, 0
from 0
office. 0

The 0
reason? 0

Allende 0
was 0
reaching 0
out 0
to 0
the 0
Russians 0
and 0
Cubans 0
in 0
a 0
spirit 0
of 0
peace 0
and 0
friendship, 0
just 0
as 0
Arbenz 0
had 0
done 0
and 0
just 0
as 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
done. 0

Thus, 0
given 0
that 0
Helms 0
was 0
an 0
admitted 1
perjurer 1
and 1
convicted 1
liar, 1
what 0
value 0
does 0
his 0
denial 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
an 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
have? 0

It 0
has 0
no 0
value 0
at 0
all. 0

And 0
Shapira, 0
who 1
“enjoys 1
writing 1
about 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
served 1
in 1
the 1
military 1
and 1
intelligence 1
communities” 1
had 0
an 0
ethical 0
duty 0
to 0
point 0
out 0
Helms’ 0
proclivity 0
for 0
lying 0
in 0
his 0
article. 0

The 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
overwhelmingly 1
establishes 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
working 0
for 0
U.S. 0
intelligence. 0

How 0
often 0
have 0
you 0
ever 0
heard 0
of 0
a 0
U.S. 0
Marine 0
communist? 0

If 0
Oswald 0
was 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist, 0
why 0
would 0
he 0
have 0
joined 0
the 0
Marines 0
in 0
the 0
1950s, 0
given 0
that 0
the 0
Marines 0
hated 0
communists 0
and 0
had 0
just 0
helped 0
kill 0
millions 0
of 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
Korean 0
War? 0

Why 0
would 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist 0
want 0
to 0
join 0
an 0
organization 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
could 0
be 0
ordered, 0
on 0
a 0
moment’s 0
notice, 0
to 0
return 0
to 0
Korea 0
or 0
be 0
sent 0
to 0
Vietnam, 0
Laos, 0
China, 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union, 0
or 0
Europe 0
to 0
kill 0
communists? 0

Don’t 0
forget: 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
the 0
Cold 0
War! 0

After 0
Oswald 0
supposedly 0
tried 0
to 0
“defect” 0
to 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union 0
and 0
promised 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
Russians 0
all 0
the 0
secrets 0
he 0
learned 0
about 0
in 0
the 0
military, 0
why 0
would 0
U.S. 0
officials 0
agree 0
to 0
let 0
him 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
country, 0
and 0
with 0
a 0
communist 1
wife? 1

Why 0
wouldn’t 0
they 0
indict 0
him 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
haul 0
him 0
before 0
a 0
federal 0
grand 0
jury 0
to 0
testify 0
as 0
to 0
what 0
secrets 0
he 0
gave 0
the 0
Russians? 0

Why 0
wouldn’t 0
they 0
harass, 1
abuse, 1
humiliate, 1
persecute, 1
or 1
prosecute 1
him, 1
like 0
they 0
did 0
to 0
Martin 0
Luther 0
King, 0
Dalton 0
Trumbo, 0
John 0
Walker 0
Lindh, 0
Chelsea 0
Manning, 0
Edward 0
Snowden, 0
and 0
other 0
people 0
they 0
have 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
communists 0
or 0
traitors? 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
that 0
Oswald 0
could 0
learn 0
fluent 0
Russian 0
while 0
serving 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
military 0
without 0
having 0
U.S. 0
military 0
tutors 0
teaching 0
him? 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
that 0
a 0
veteran 0
who 0
embarrasses 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Marine 0
Corps 0
by 0
openly 0
proselytizing 0
for 0
communism 0
in 0
New 0
Orleans 0
is 0
able 0
to 0
saunter 0
across 0
the 0
Cold 0
War 0
stage 0
of 0
history, 0
not 0
long 0
after 0
the 0
McCarthy 0
hearings, 0
without 1
nary 1
a 1
care 1
in 1
the 1
world? 1

The 1
answer: 1
Helms 1
lied. 1

There 1
is 1
no 1
reasonable 1
doubt 1
that 1
Oswald 1
was 1
a 1
U.S. 1
intelligence 1
agent, 1
one 0
who 0
was 0
ordered 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City 0
to 0
set 0
the 0
framework 0
for 0
his 0
frame-up. 0

But 0
things 0
obviously 0
went 0
dreadfully 1
wrong 1
in 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
that 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
post-assassination 0
investigation. 0

Not 0
surprisingly, 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
Mexico 0
City 0
operations 0
regarding 0
Oswald 0
are 0
among 0
the 0
98 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
records 0
that 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
have 0
chosen 0
to 0
continue 0
keeping 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people, 1
on 0
grounds 0
of 0
“national 0
security” 0
of 0
course. 0

Thus, 0
when 1
Oswald 1
was 1
claiming 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
framed, 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
entity 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
thinking 1
about: 1
the 1
CIA, 1
the 0
agency 0
whose 0
officials, 0
as 0
former 0
Washington 0
Post 0
investigative 0
reporter 0
Jefferson 0
Morley 0
has 0
documented, 0
were 1
secretly 1
monitoring 1
his 1
activities 1
in 1
the 1
weeks 1
leading 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
assassination, 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
ensure 1
that 1
Oswald 1
had 1
not 1
figured 1
out 1
what 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
happen 1
to 1
him. 1

We 0
can 0
assume 0
that 0
any 0
frame-up 0
by 0
the 0
CIA 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
good. 0

The 0
operation 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
carefully 0
planned 0
and 0
executed. 0

But 1
no 1
plan 1
is 1
perfect. 1

Things 0
are 0
inevitably 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
wrong. 0

The 0
pieces 0
aren’t 0
going 0
to 0
fit 0
together 0
perfectly. 0

The 0
Mexico 0
City 0
operation 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
of 0
that. 0

That’s 1
why 1
the 1
CIA 1
has 1
to 1
continue 1
keeping 1
those 1
records 1
secret. 1

But 0
here’s 0
another 0
example, 0
a 0
small 0
but 0
important 0
one: 0
Recall 0
that 0
Oswald 0
supposedly 0
hid 0
the 0
rifle 0
before 0
he 0
headed 0
down 0
the 0
steps 0
from 0
the 0
sixth 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
school 0
book 0
depository. 0

Ask 0
yourself: 0
If 0
someone 0
has 0
just 0
assassinated 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
is 0
he 0
really 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
hide 0
the 0
rifle? 0

What 0
good 0
would 0
that 0
do? 0

Wouldn’t 0
officials 0
conduct 0
a 0
thorough 0
search 0
of 0
the 0
area? 0

Wouldn’t 0
an 0
assassin 0
instead 0
simply 0
leave 0
the 0
rifle 0
there 0
and 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
there 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
he 0
could? 0

Then 1
why 1
the 1
hidden 1
rifle? 1

Because 1
it’s 1
consistent 1
with 1
a 1
frame-up. 1

The 0
framers 0
had 0
to 0
hide 0
the 0
rifle 0
in 0
advance 0
in 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
no 0
one 0
CIA 0
& 0
JFK: 0
The 0
Secret 0
... 0
Jefferson 0

would 0
see 0
it 0
during 0
the 0
morning 0
of 0
the 0
assassination, 0
which 0
took 0
place 0
after 0
noon. 0

No 0
matter 0
how 0
good 0
a 0
frame-up 0
was, 0
the 0
CIA 0
knew 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
detected 0
with 0
an 0
aggressive 0
investigation. 0

That’s 0
where 0
ingenuity 1
and 1
cunning 1
come 1
into 1
play. 1

They 0
had 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
investigation 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
frame-up 0
would 0
remain 0
intact. 0

That’s 1
why 1
they 1
had 1
shots 1
fired 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
placed 1
Oswald 1
in 1
the 1
rear. 1

The 0
idea 0
was 0
that 0
since 0
an 0
investigation 0
would 0
lead 0
to 0
Oswald’s 0
supposed 0
communist 0
confederates 0
in 0
the 0
front, 0
which 0
in 0
turn 0
would 0
lead 0
to 0
nuclear 0
war, 0
the 0
investigation 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
shut 0
down 0
immediately, 0
especially 0
since 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
CIA 0
itself 0
that 0
had 0
started 0
the 0
assassination 0
game 0
by 0
repeatedly 0
attempting, 0
in 0
partnership 0
with 0
the 0
Mafia, 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Castro. 0

It 0
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
brilliant 1
and 1
cunning 1
ruses 1
in 1
history. 1

They 0
get 0
the 0
body 0
out 0
of 0
Parkland 0
by 0
force, 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
Texas 0
law, 0
and 0
put 0
it 0
in 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
military 0
in 0
Maryland, 0
which 0
conducts 0
a 1
secret 1
fraudulent 1
and 1
bogus 1
autopsy. 1

that 0

Then 0
keep 0

for 0
decades, 0
when 0
many 0
people 0
won’t 0

And 0
employ 0

to 0
flood 0
