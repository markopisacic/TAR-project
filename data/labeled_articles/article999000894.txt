Currently, 0
two 0
groups 0
of 0
migrants, 0
according 0
to 0
various 0
estimates 0
numbering 0
up 0
to 0
6,500 0
people, 0
mainly 0
families, 0
are 0
heading 0
towards 0
the 0
US 0
through 0
Mexico. 0

Meanwhile, 0
a 0
third 0
caravan 0
of 0
migrants, 0
this 0
time 0
from 0
El 0
Salvador, 0
has 0
reportedly 0
already 0
crossed 0
into 0
Mexico. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
according 0
to 0
military 0
planning 0
documents, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
crowd 0
might 0
dissolve 0
along 0
their 0
long 0
journey 0
to 0
the 0
US. 0

While 0
the 0
US 0
still 0
has 0
very 0
little 0
intel 0
about 0
the 0
composition 0
of 0
the 0
migrant 0
caravans, 0
one 0
way 0
or 0
the 0
other 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
plans 0
to 0
outmatch 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
potential 0
illegals 0
and, 0
if 0
not, 0
suppress 1
them 1
with 1
brutal 1
force. 1

Currently, 0
Washington 0
has 0
allocated 0
roughly 0
the 0

number 0

to 0

in 0

(2,000) 0
