published 0
on 0
June 0

the 0

ideologically 1
motivated 1
attack 1
on 0
all 0
who 0
ever 0
get 0

The 0
piece 0
is 0
so 0
riddled 0
with 0
non-sequiturs 0
and 0
wild 1
generalizations 0
that 0
it 0
seems 0
almost 0
cruel 1
to 0
rip 0
it 0
to 0
shreds. 0

the 0

Bharath 0
Ganesh. 0

A 0

that 0
Ganesh 0
is 0
currently 0
working 0
at 0
the 0
Oxford 0

Institute 0
— 0
at 0
the 0

to 0

ways 0

“The 0

Note 0
the 0
claims 0
– 0
utterly 1
disingenuous, 1
as 0
it 0
turns 0
out 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
labeling 0
of 0
certain 0
people 0
or 0
groups 0
as 0
“violent 1
extremists” 1
is 0
entirely 0
due 0
to 0
their 0
own 0
behavior; 0
in 0
other 0
words, 0
don’t 0
worry, 0
folks, 0
it’s 0
all 0
scientifically 0
objective. 0

This 0
research 0
is 0
being 0
used 0
to 0
advise 0
companies 0
who 0
host 0
online 0
platforms, 0
such 0
as 0
Facebook, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
governments, 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
stamp 0
out 0
online 0
radicalization 0
– 0
using 0
strategies 0
such 0
as 0
working 0
out 0
ways 0
of 0
preventing 0
people 0
from 0
seeing 0
material 0
posted 0
that 0
is 0
deemed 0
unsuitable 0
in 0
some 0
way, 0
or 0
offering 0
them 0
alternative 0
“nice” 0
things 0
to 0
look 0
at. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
seriously 0
important 0
issue. 0

The 0
people 0
and 0
political 0
powers 0
behind 0
such 0
initiatives 0
are 0
manipulating 0
behavior 0
online 0
and 0
literally 0
controlling 0
how 0
people 0
think 0
and 0
get 0
information. 0

They 0
are 0
the 0
appointed 0
guardians 0
of 0
the 0
online 0
hoi 0
polloi. 0

But 0
who 1
guards 1
the 1
guardians? 1

For 0
if 0
Dr. 0
Ganesh 0
is 0
in 0
charge, 0
we 0
have 0
some 0
very 0
worrying 0
questions 0
to 0
ask. 0

One 0
could 0
start 0
from 0
the 0
observation 0
that 0
the 0
article 0
is 0
certainly 0
not 0
an 0
academic 0
piece, 0
and 0
gives 0
no 0
concrete 0
evidence 0
for 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
sweeping 0
claims 0
it 0
makes 0
about 0
the 0
so-called 0
“alt-right” 0
and 0
the 0
“manosphere”; 0
nor 0
does 0
it, 0
as 0
any 0
academic 0
should 0
do, 0
attempt 0
to 0
test 0
ideas 0
and 0
consider 0
alternative 0
explanations. 0

(Oddly 0
enough, 0
this 0
makes 0
it 0
rather 0
like 0
the 0
groups 0
it 0
claims 0
to 0
criticize.) 0

And 0
the 0
label 0
of 0
“violent 1
extremist” 1
turns 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
used 0
very 0
generously. 0

Ganesh 0
makes 0
wild 1
leaps 0
and 0
inferences. 0

He 0
talks 0
of 0
Darren 0
Osborne, 0
the 0
perpetrator 0
of 0
the 0
vehicular 0
attack 0
on 0
Finsbury 0
Park 0
Mosque. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
heinous 1
crime, 0
and 0
should 0
rightly 0
be 0
condemned. 0

But 0
why 0
did 0
Osborne 0
do 0
this, 0
according 0
to 0
Ganesh? 0

The 0
attack 0
“was 0
executed 0
after 0
he 0
had 0
become 0
indignant 0
after 0
watching 0
a 0
BBC 0
broadcast 0
on 0
child 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
and 0
turned 0
to 0
social 0
media 0
to 0
make 0
sense 0
of 0
it. 0

He 0
found 0
a 0
narrative 0
from 0
British 0
counter-jihad 0
groups 0
closely 0
aligned 0
with 0
the 0
alt-right, 0
such 0
as 0
Britain 0
First 0
and 0
the 0
founder 0
of 0
the 0
English 0
Defence 0
League 0
Tommy 0
Robinson.” 0
The 0
British 0
counter-jihad 0
movement 0
is 0
thus 0
swept 0
into 0
the 0
same 0
group 0
of 0
violent 1
extremists 1
as 0
Osborne, 0
because 0
Ganesh 0
“knows” 1
they 0
encouraged 0
him. 0

The 0
BBC 0
broadcast 0
was 0
the 0
drama 0
based 0
on 0
real 0
life, 0
Three 0
Girls, 0
which 0
showed 0
real-life 0
events 0
of 0
three 0
of 0
the 0
(very 0
many) 0
victims 0
of 0
the 0
Rochdale 0
Muslim 0
rape 0
gangs. 0

Ganesh 0
somehow 0
knows 0
precisely 0
what 0
went 0
on 0
in 0
Osborne’s 0
mind. 0

Rather 0
than 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
outrage 0
at 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
the 0
gangs 0
of 0
Muslim 0
men 0
of 0
Pakistani 0
background 0
who 0
abused 0
the 0
girls 0
portrayed 0
in 0
Three 0
Girls 0
that 0
caused 0
Osborne 0
to 0
lose 0
his 0
mind 0
and 0
commit 0
his 0
terrible 1
crime, 0
Ganesh 0
blames 0
Obsorne’s 0
act 0
on 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
Tommy 0
Robinson. 0

Yet 0
Robinson 0
explicitly 0
fights 0
AGAINST 1
political 0
violence. 0

What 1
“narrative 1
from 1
British 1
counter-jihad 1
groups” 1
can 1
one 1
find 1
which 1
suggests 1
driving 1
vehicles 1
into 1
innocent 1
Muslims 1
standing 1
outside 1
a 1
mosque? 1

I’m 0
sure 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
any, 0
Ganesh 0
would, 0
as 0
a 0
researcher 0
at 0
an 0
elite 0
institution, 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
it. 0

But 0
there 1
is 1
none 1
offered 1
– 0
only 0
surmise 0
and 0
Ganesh’s 0
mindreading 0
techniques. 0

I 0
suppose 0
if 0
you’re 0
paid 0
to 0
fight 0
online 0
extremism, 0
you’d 0
better 0
find 0
it, 0
or 0
you’re 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
job 0
and 0
short 0
of 0
academic 0
publication. 0

We 0
have 0
also 0
the 0
ridiculous 1
idea 0
that 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
“alt-right.” 0
He, 0
in 0
fact, 0
describes 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
centrist 0
– 0
he’s 0
said 0
he 0
agrees 0
with 0
Labour 0
on 0
some 0
things, 0
the 0
Tories 0
on 0
other 0
things, 0
and 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
EDL 0
precisely 0
because 0
he 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
infiltration 0
by 0
the 0
far 0
right. 0

He 0
shows 0
no 0
hint 0
of 0
racism 0
or 0
of 0
white 0
supremacism. 0

The 0
writer 0
of 0
this 0
shoddy 1
article 0
is 0
working 0
at 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
elite 0

of 0
manipulating 0
and 0
policing 0
the 0
communications 0
and 0
information 0
we 0
have 0
online. 0

We 0
have 0
to 0
ask. 0

Is 0
it 0
simply 0
a 0
coincidence 0
that 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
now 0
in 0
prison, 0
and 0
that 0
a 0
“researcher” 1
who 0
presents 0
such 0
a 0
misleading 0
account 0
of 0
Robinson 0
is 0
currently 0
actively 0
engaged 0
in 0
consultation 0
with 0
Oxford 0
University 0
and 0
the 0
European 0
Union 0
in 0
advising 0
how 0

activities, 0

the 0

and 0
misrepresentations 0
about 0
him 0
to 0
those 0
in 0
power? 0

There’s 0

Bharath 0
