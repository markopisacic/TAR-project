the 0

In 0
2010, 0
more 0
than 0
1,100 0

were 0

them 0
by 0

and 0

But 0
while 0
this 0
internal 0
grumbling 0
took 0
place, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
dutifully 0
reported 0
official 0
statements 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
veracity 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
disputed. 0

Tom 0
Wells, 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
exhaustive 0
exposé 0
“The 0
War 0
Within: 0
America’s 0
Battle 0
Over 0
Vietnam,” 0
explained 0
the 0
media 0
egregiously 0
erred 0
in 0
“almost 0
exclusive 0
reliance 0
on 0
U.S. 0
government 0
officials 0
as 0
sources 0
of 0
information” 0
and 0
“reluctance 0
to 0
question 0
official 0
pronouncements 0
on 0
‘national 0
security 0
issues.’” 0

If 0
due 0
diligence 0
had 0
been 0
performed, 0
and 0
reporters 0
had 0
raised 0
appropriate 0
doubts 0
about 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
false 0
flag, 0
it’s 0
arguable 0
whether 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
contentious 0
war 0
would 0
have 0
lasted 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
it 0
did. 0

Sadly, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
a 0
tendency 0
to 0
repeat 0
the 0
same 0
mistakes 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again. 0

And 0
now, 0
a 0
US 0
Army 0
Colonel 0
is 0
predicting 0
that 0
another 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident 0
could 0
bring 0
us 0
into 0
war 0
with 0
Iran. 0

As 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
continues 0
to 0
surround 0
himself 0
with 0
neocon 1
warhawks, 1
the 0
drums 0
are 0
beating 0
for 0
war 0
with 0
Iran. 0

The 0
rhetoric 0
is 0
becoming 0
so 0
strong, 0
that 0
Trump 0
himself 0
— 0
without 0
provocation 0
— 0
began 0
tweeting 0
threats 0
to 0
the 0
sovereign 0
nation. 0

On 0
Tuesday, 0
Fox 0
News 0
host 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
and 0
Colonel 0
Douglas 0
Macgregor 0
addressed 0
the 0
growing 0
prospect 0
of 0
US 0
war 0
with 0
Iran 0
and 0
warned 0
that 0
a 0
new 0
“Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident” 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drag 0
us 0
into 0
it. 0

Carlson 0
mocked 0
the 0
neocons’ 0
claims 0
that 0
Iran 0
is 0
the 0
“greatest 1
threat” 1
to 0
America, 1
explicitly 0
noting 0
that 0
“virtually 0
every 0
attack 0
in 0
America 0
has 0
been 0
inspired 0
not 0
by 0
Iran, 0
but 0
by 0
Iran’s 0
Sunni 0
enemies.” 0

Carlson 0
pointed 0
out 0
how 0
the 0
neocons 0
are 0
hellbent 1
on 0
pushing 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
into 0
a 0
new 0
war. 0

“If 0
there 0
was 0
ever 0
a 0
swamp 0
in 0
Washington 0
you 0
are 0
looking 0
at 0
it 0
— 0
the 0
foreign 0
policy 0
establishment 0
— 0
they 0
are 0
working 0
overtime 0
to 0
ensnare 1
the 0
president 0
in 0
a 0
mess 0
in 0
Iran,” 0
Carlson 0
said. 0

“Let’s 0
hope 0
that 0
he 0
understands 0
exactly 0
what’s 0
going 0
on.” 0

Pointing 0
out 0
Trump’s 0
recent 0
attempts 0
at 0
diplomacy 0
with 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
Russia, 0
Col. 0
Macgregor 0
weighed 0
in, 0
noting 0
that 0
he 0
thinks 0
Trump 0
will 0
attempt 0
to 0
avoid 0
war 0
with 0
Iran. 0

However, 0
he 0
noted 0
that 0
a 0
false 0
flag 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drag 0
us 0
into 0
it. 0

“I 0
think 0
the 0
president 0
needs 0
to 0
watch 0
carefully 0
for 0
the 0
potential 0
for 0
something 0
like 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident,” 0
Col. 0
Macgregor 0
said. 0

“Many 0
of 0
your 0
viewers 0
may 0
not 0
remember 0
that 0
it 0
never 0
happened 0
and 0
we 0
could 0
very 0
well 0
be 0
treated 0
to 0
something 0
like 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
Gulf. 0

We 0
should 0
watch 0
for 0
that, 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
comments 0
on 0
fake 0
news, 0
he 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
sabotage 0
by 0
fake 0
news.” 0

Carlson 0
then 0
pointed 0
out 0
how 0
the 0
Trump 0
admin 0
has 0
reacted 0
to 0
fake 0
news 0
by 0
attacking 0
Syria—twice. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
may 0
be 0
unaware, 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
overthrow 0
Iran 0
has 0
long 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
works. 0

In 0
fact, 0
in 0
April 0
2012, 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize-winning 0
journalist, 0
Seymour 0
Hersh 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Joint 0
Special 0
Operations 0
Command 0
had 0
trained 0
(Mojahedin-e 0
Khalq) 0
MEK 0
operatives 0
at 0
a 0
secret 0
site 0
in 0
Nevada 0
from 0
2005 0
to 0
2009. 0

MEK 0
is 0
the 0
Iranian 0
political-militant 0
organization 0
that 0
advocates 0
for 0
the 0
violent 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime. 0

They 0
are 0
hardly 0
quiet 0
about 0
it. 0

According 0
to 0
Hersh, 0
MEK 0
members 0
were 0
trained 0
in 0
intercepting 0
communications, 0
cryptography, 0
weaponry 0
and 0
small 0
unit 0
tactics 0
at 0
the 0
Nevada 0
site 0
until 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
took 0
office 0
in 0
2009. 0

Hersh 0
also 0
reported 0
additional 0
names 0
of 0
former 0
U.S. 0
officials 0
paid 0
to 0
speak 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
MEK, 0
including 0
former 0
CIA 0
directors 0
James 0
Woolsey 0
and 0
Porter 0
Goss; 0
New 0
York 0
City 0
Mayor 0
Rudolph 0
Giuliani; 0
former 0
Vermont 0
Governor 0
Howard 0
Dean; 0
former 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Investigation 0
Louis 0
Freeh 0
and 0
former 0
U.N. 0

Ambassador 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

Coincidentally, 0
MEK 0
was 0
classified 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
its 0
allies—during 0
this 0
training 0
period—until 0
they 0
suddenly 0
removed 0
them 0
from 0
the 0
list 0
in 0
2012. 0

While 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
is 0
certainly 0
no 0
bastion 0
of 0
freedom, 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
US 0
intervention 0
or 0
a 0
violent 0
revolution 0
would 0
be 0
beneficial 0
for 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
is 0
outright 1
insane. 1

To 0
see 0
what 0
US 0
intervention—through 0
military 0
support 0
and 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
‘protesters’—does 0
to 0
countries, 0
one 0
need 0
only 0
look 0
at 0
Syria, 0
Iraq, 0
Afghanistan, 0
and 0
Libya 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
horrific 1
death 0
tolls 0
and 0
war-ravaged 1
dystopias 1
left 0
in 0
America’s 0
wake. 0

To 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
over 0
the 0
years, 0
Trump’s 0
desire 0
to 0
intervene 0
in 0
Iran, 0
and 0
his 0
subsequent 0
support 0
in 0
the 0
media 0
should 0
come 0
as 0
no 0
surprise 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
plan 0
since 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
was 0
in 0
office 0
and 0
was 0
documented 0
in 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
PNAC 0
report. 0

This 0
was 0
even 0
admitted 0
by 0
General 0
Wesley 0
Clark, 0
former 0
Supreme 0
Allied 0
Commander 0
of 0
NATO, 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
planned 0
on 0
going 0
to 0
war 0
with 0
Iran, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
2001 0
memo 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
memo 0
that 0
describes 0
how 0
we’re 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
out 0
seven 0
countries 0
in 0
five 0
years,” 0
Clark 0
said. 0

“Starting 0
with 0
Iraq, 0
and 0
then 0
Syria, 0
Lebanon, 0
Libya, 0
Somalia, 0
Sudan, 0
and 0
finishing 0
off 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

All 0
presidents 0
since 0
Clinton 0
have 0
crossed 0
countries 0
off 0
this 0
list. 0

Now 0
it’s 0
Trump’s 0
turn. 0
