explained 0 14 19
the 0 14 19

egregiously 0 14 19
erred 0 14 19
in 0 14 19
“almost 0 14 19

had 0 14 20
been 0 14 20
performed, 0 14 20
and 0 14 20
reporters 0 14 20
had 0 14 20
raised 0 14 20
appropriate 0 14 20
doubts 0 14 20
about 0 14 20
the 0 14 20
Gulf 0 14 20
of 0 14 20

it’s 0 14 20
arguable 0 14 20
whether 0 14 20
support 0 14 20
for 0 14 20
the 0 14 20
contentious 0 14 20

long 0 14 20
as 0 14 20
it 0 14 20
did. 0 14 20

Sadly, 0 14 21
the 0 14 21
United 0 14 21
States 0 14 21
has 0 14 21
a 0 14 21

over 0 14 21
again. 0 14 21

And 0 14 22
now, 0 14 22
a 0 14 22
US 0 14 22
Army 0 14 22
Colonel 0 14 22
is 0 14 22
predicting 0 14 22

another 0 14 22
Gulf 0 14 22

war 0 14 22
with 0 14 22
Iran. 0 14 22

As 0 14 23
President 0 14 23
Donald 0 14 23
Trump 0 14 23
continues 0 14 23
to 0 14 23
surround 0 14 23
himself 0 14 23
with 0 14 23
neocon 1 14 23
warhawks, 1 14 23
the 0 14 23

for 0 14 23

The 0 14 24
rhetoric 0 14 24
is 0 14 24
becoming 0 14 24
so 0 14 24
strong, 0 14 24
that 0 14 24
Trump 0 14 24
himself 0 14 24
— 0 14 24
without 0 14 24

Colonel 0 14 25

Carlson 0 14 26
mocked 0 14 26
the 0 14 26
neocons’ 0 14 26
claims 0 14 26
that 0 14 26

the 0 14 26
“greatest 1 14 26
threat” 1 14 26
to 0 14 26
America, 1 14 26
explicitly 0 14 26
noting 0 14 26
that 0 14 26
“virtually 0 14 26
every 0 14 26

been 0 14 26
inspired 0 14 26
not 0 14 26
by 0 14 26

but 0 14 26
by 0 14 26
Iran’s 0 14 26
Sunni 0 14 26
enemies.” 0 14 26

Carlson 0 14 27
pointed 0 14 27
out 0 14 27
how 0 14 27
the 0 14 27
neocons 0 14 27
are 0 14 27
hellbent 1 14 27
on 0 14 27

“If 0 14 28
there 0 14 28
was 0 14 28
ever 0 14 28
a 0 14 28
swamp 0 14 28
in 0 14 28
Washington 0 14 28
you 0 14 28

“Let’s 0 14 29

Russia, 0 14 30
Col. 0 14 30

weighed 0 14 30

noting 0 14 30
that 0 14 30

war 0 14 30

However, 0 14 31
he 0 14 31
noted 0 14 31
that 0 14 31
a 0 14 31

it. 0 14 31

“I 0 14 32
think 0 14 32
the 0 14 32

needs 0 14 32
to 0 14 32
watch 0 14 32
carefully 0 14 32

the 0 14 32

“Many 0 14 33
of 0 14 33
your 0 14 33

may 0 14 33
not 0 14 33
remember 0 14 33
that 0 14 33
it 0 14 33
never 0 14 33

we 0 14 33

We 0 14 34

this 0 14 34

Syria—twice. 0 14 35

For 0 14 36
those 0 14 36
who 0 14 36
may 0 14 36
be 0 14 36
unaware, 0 14 36
the 0 14 36
plan 0 14 36
to 0 14 36
overthrow 0 14 36
Iran 0 14 36
has 0 14 36
long 0 14 36
been 0 14 36
in 0 14 36
the 0 14 36
works. 0 14 36

In 0 14 37
fact, 0 14 37
in 0 14 37
April 0 14 37
2012, 0 14 37
Pulitzer 0 14 37
Prize-winning 0 14 37
journalist, 0 14 37
Seymour 0 14 37
Hersh 0 14 37
reported 0 14 37
that 0 14 37
the 0 14 37
U.S. 0 14 37
Joint 0 14 37
Special 0 14 37
Operations 0 14 37

a 0 14 37
secret 0 14 37
site 0 14 37
in 0 14 37

from 0 14 37
2005 0 14 37
to 0 14 37
2009. 0 14 37

MEK 0 14 38
is 0 14 38
the 0 14 38
Iranian 0 14 38
political-militant 0 14 38
organization 0 14 38
that 0 14 38
advocates 0 14 38
for 0 14 38
the 0 14 38
violent 0 14 38
overthrow 0 14 38
of 0 14 38
the 0 14 38
current 0 14 38
Iranian 0 14 38
regime. 0 14 38

They 0 14 39
are 0 14 39
hardly 0 14 39
quiet 0 14 39
about 0 14 39
it. 0 14 39

According 0 14 40
to 0 14 40
Hersh, 0 14 40
MEK 0 14 40
members 0 14 40
were 0 14 40
trained 0 14 40
in 0 14 40
intercepting 0 14 40
communications, 0 14 40
cryptography, 0 14 40
weaponry 0 14 40
and 0 14 40

at 0 14 40
the 0 14 40
Nevada 0 14 40
site 0 14 40
until 0 14 40
President 0 14 40
Barack 0 14 40
Obama 0 14 40
took 0 14 40
office 0 14 40
in 0 14 40
2009. 0 14 40

Hersh 0 14 41
also 0 14 41
reported 0 14 41
additional 0 14 41
names 0 14 41
of 0 14 41
former 0 14 41
U.S. 0 14 41

to 0 14 41
speak 0 14 41
in 0 14 41
support 0 14 41
of 0 14 41
MEK, 0 14 41
including 0 14 41
former 0 14 41

directors 0 14 41
James 0 14 41

Coincidentally, 0 14 43
MEK 0 14 43
was 0 14 43
classified 0 14 43
as 0 14 43
a 0 14 43
terrorist 0 14 43
organization 0 14 43
by 0 14 43
the 0 14 43
United 0 14 43
States 0 14 43
and 0 14 43
its 0 14 43
allies—during 0 14 43
this 0 14 43
training 0 14 43
period—until 0 14 43
they 0 14 43
suddenly 0 14 43
removed 0 14 43
them 0 14 43
from 0 14 43
the 0 14 43
list 0 14 43
in 0 14 43
2012. 0 14 43

While 0 14 44
the 0 14 44
current 0 14 44
Iranian 0 14 44
regime 0 14 44
is 0 14 44
certainly 0 14 44
no 0 14 44
bastion 0 14 44
of 0 14 44
freedom, 0 14 44
the 0 14 44
idea 0 14 44
that 0 14 44
US 0 14 44
intervention 0 14 44
or 0 14 44
a 0 14 44
violent 0 14 44
revolution 0 14 44
would 0 14 44
be 0 14 44
beneficial 0 14 44
for 0 14 44
the 0 14 44
people 0 14 44
of 0 14 44
Iran 0 14 44
is 0 14 44
outright 1 14 44
insane. 1 14 44

To 0 14 45
see 0 14 45
what 0 14 45
US 0 14 45
intervention—through 0 14 45
military 0 14 45
support 0 14 45
and 0 14 45
the 0 14 45
support 0 14 45
of 0 14 45
‘protesters’—does 0 14 45
to 0 14 45
countries, 0 14 45
one 0 14 45
need 0 14 45
only 0 14 45
look 0 14 45
at 0 14 45
Syria, 0 14 45
Iraq, 0 14 45
Afghanistan, 0 14 45
and 0 14 45
Libya 0 14 45
to 0 14 45
see 0 14 45
the 0 14 45
horrific 1 14 45
death 0 14 45
tolls 0 14 45
and 0 14 45
war-ravaged 1 14 45
dystopias 1 14 45
left 0 14 45
in 0 14 45
America’s 0 14 45
wake. 0 14 45

To 0 14 46
those 0 14 46
paying 0 14 46
attention 0 14 46
over 0 14 46
the 0 14 46
years, 0 14 46
Trump’s 0 14 46
desire 0 14 46
to 0 14 46
intervene 0 14 46
in 0 14 46
Iran, 0 14 46
and 0 14 46
his 0 14 46
subsequent 0 14 46
support 0 14 46
in 0 14 46
the 0 14 46
media 0 14 46
should 0 14 46
come 0 14 46
as 0 14 46
no 0 14 46
surprise 0 14 46
as 0 14 46
it 0 14 46
has 0 14 46
been 0 14 46
the 0 14 46
plan 0 14 46
since 0 14 46
Bill 0 14 46
Clinton 0 14 46
was 0 14 46
in 0 14 46
office 0 14 46
and 0 14 46
was 0 14 46
documented 0 14 46
in 0 14 46
the 0 14 46
neoconservative 0 14 46
PNAC 0 14 46
report. 0 14 46

This 0 14 47
was 0 14 47
even 0 14 47
admitted 0 14 47
by 0 14 47
General 0 14 47
Wesley 0 14 47
Clark, 0 14 47
former 0 14 47
Supreme 0 14 47
Allied 0 14 47
Commander 0 14 47
of 0 14 47
NATO, 0 14 47
that 0 14 47
the 0 14 47
U.S. 0 14 47
planned 0 14 47
on 0 14 47
going 0 14 47
to 0 14 47
war 0 14 47
with 0 14 47
Iran, 0 14 47
according 0 14 47
to 0 14 47
a 0 14 47
2001 0 14 47
memo 0 14 47
from 0 14 47
the 0 14 47
U.S. 0 14 47
Secretary 0 14 47
of 0 14 47
Defense. 0 14 47

“This 0 14 48
is 0 14 48
a 0 14 48
memo 0 14 48
that 0 14 48
describes 0 14 48
how 0 14 48
we’re 0 14 48
going 0 14 48
to 0 14 48
take 0 14 48
out 0 14 48
seven 0 14 48
countries 0 14 48
in 0 14 48
five 0 14 48
years,” 0 14 48
Clark 0 14 48
said. 0 14 48

“Starting 0 14 49
with 0 14 49
Iraq, 0 14 49
and 0 14 49
then 0 14 49
Syria, 0 14 49
Lebanon, 0 14 49
Libya, 0 14 49
Somalia, 0 14 49
Sudan, 0 14 49
and 0 14 49
finishing 0 14 49
off 0 14 49
with 0 14 49
Iran.” 0 14 49

All 0 14 50
presidents 0 14 50
since 0 14 50

have 0 14 50
crossed 0 14 50
countries 0 14 50
off 0 14 50
this 0 14 50
list. 0 14 50

Now 0 14 51
it’s 0 14 51
Trump’s 0 14 51
turn. 0 14 51
