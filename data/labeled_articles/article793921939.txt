nothing 0 167 68

with 0 167 68

despite 0 167 68
the 0 167 68
numerous 0 167 68
Islamic 0 167 68
texts 0 167 68

McMaster 0 167 69
went 0 167 69
so 0 167 69
far 0 167 69
as 0 167 69
to 0 167 69
claim 0 167 69
that 0 167 69

were 0 167 69
“irreligious.” 0 167 69

Again, 1 167 71
and 1 167 71
I 1 167 71
have 1 167 71
asked 1 167 71
this 1 167 71
before, 1 167 71
how 1 167 71
do 1 167 71
you 1 167 71
fight 1 167 71
the 1 167 71
Deep 1 167 71
State 1 167 71
by 1 167 71
putting 1 167 71
Deep 1 167 71
State 1 167 71
operatives 1 167 71
in 1 167 71
these 1 167 71
positions? 1 167 71

How 1 167 72
do 1 167 72
you 1 167 72
drain 1 167 72
the 1 167 72
swamp 1 167 72
by 1 167 72
adding 1 167 72
to 1 167 72
it? 1 167 72

The 0 167 73
answer 0 167 73
is 0 167 73
clear: 0 167 73
You 0 167 73
don't. 0 167 73

This 0 167 74
would 0 167 74
actually 0 167 74
be 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
perfect 0 167 74
time 0 167 74
for 0 167 74
Trump 0 167 74
not 0 167 74
to 0 167 74
appoint 0 167 74
an 0 167 74
ambassador 0 167 74
to 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
UN 0 167 74
and 0 167 74
call 0 167 74
for 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
US 0 167 74
to 0 167 74
exit 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
anti-American 1 167 74
organization 0 167 74
and 0 167 74
demand 0 167 74
Congress 0 167 74
stop 0 167 74
funding 0 167 74
it 0 167 74
and 0 167 74
evict 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
UN 0 167 74
from 0 167 74
US 0 167 74
soil, 0 167 74
but 0 167 74
I'm 0 167 74
not 0 167 74

my 0 167 74
breath. 0 167 74
