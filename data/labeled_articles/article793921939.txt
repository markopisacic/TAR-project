Powell, 0
who 0
returned 0

role 0
after 0
leaving 0
her 0
job 0
as 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
deputy 0
national 0

is 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
strongly 0
considering 0
the 0
job 0
but 0
also 0
weighing 0
family 0
concerns. 0

Powell 0
already 0
lives 0
in 0
New 0
York, 0
where 0
the 0
U.N. 0
is 0
based, 0
but 0
has 0

and 0
left 0
the 0
administration 0
in 0

She 0
is 0
also 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
happy 0
in 0
her 0
job 0
at 0
Goldman. 0

Born 0
in 0
Egypt 0
and 0
raised 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Powell 0
is 0
well 0
liked 0
by 0

as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
president’s 0
daughter 0
Ivanka 0
and 0
son-in-law, 0
Jared 0
Kushner. 0

But 0
she 0
is 0
already 0
coming 0
under 0
criticism 0
from 0
some 0
conservatives 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
who 0
maintain 0
that 0
Powell 0
is 0
a 0
“globalist” 0
not 0
closely 0
enough 0
aligned 0
with 0
Trump’s 0
“America 1
first” 1
approach 0
to 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Trump 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
described 0
Powell 0
as 0
a 0
“person 0
I 0
would 0
consider” 0
when 0
asked 0
about 0
her 0
possible 0
nomination. 0

“She 0
is 0
under 0
consideration. 0

We 0
have, 0
actually, 0
many 0
names,” 0
he 0
said. 0

However, 0
according 0
to 0
Bloomberg, 0
Powell 0
isn't 0
interested 0
in 0
the 0
position. 0

She 0
says 0
she 0
is 0

Dina 0
Powell 0
has 0
told 0

that 0
she’s 0

leaving 0
the 0
firm 0
to 0
rejoin 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
as 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0

according 0
to 0
two 0
people 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
matter. 0

President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
has 0
called 0
Powell 0
about 0
the 0

twice, 0
first 0
on 0
Sunday 0
-- 0
before 0
current 0
United 0

Nikki 0
Haley 0
announced 0
her 0
resignation 0
-- 0
and 0
again 0
on 0
Wednesday, 0
the 0
people 0
said. 0

He 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
he’s 0
interested 0
in 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
appointing 0
Powell 0
to 0
the 0
position, 0
they 0
said, 0

he 0

at 0

of 0

willfully 1

McMaster 0

that 0
clearly 0
opposed 0

Back 0
in 0
2017, 0
she 0
resigned 0
her 0
post 0
of 0
Deputy 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
NSC 0
under 0
Islamic 0
apologist 0
H. 0
R. 0
McMaster, 0
whose 0
failed 0
views 0
she 0
shared. 0

McMaster 0
subscribed 0
to 0
the 0
Obama 0
view 0
that 0
Islamic 0
terrorism 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Islam, 0
despite 0
the 0
numerous 0
Islamic 0
texts 0
and 0
teachings 0
that 0
incite 0
Muslims 0
to 0
wage 0
war 0
against 0
unbelievers. 0

McMaster 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
claim 0
that 0
devout 0
jihadis 0
were 0
“irreligious.” 0
McMaster 0
forced 0
out 0
superb 0
K.T. 0

McFarland 0
from 0
her 0
role 0

National 0

Again, 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
asked 1
this 1
before, 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
fight 1
the 1
Deep 1
State 1
by 1
putting 1
Deep 1
State 1
operatives 1
in 1
these 1
positions? 1

How 1
do 1
you 1
drain 1
the 1
swamp 1
by 1
adding 1
to 1
it? 1

The 0
answer 0
is 0
clear: 0
You 0
don't. 0

This 0
would 0
actually 0
be 0
the 0
perfect 0
time 0
for 0
Trump 0
not 0
to 0
appoint 0
an 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
and 0
call 0
for 0
the 0
US 0
to 0
exit 0
the 0
anti-American 1
organization 0
and 0
demand 0
Congress 0
stop 0
funding 0
it 0
and 0
evict 0
the 0
UN 0
from 0
US 0
soil, 0
but 0
I'm 0
not 0
holding 0
my 0
breath. 0
