"There 1
is 1
no 1
Republican 1
Party. 1

There's 1
a 1
Trump 1
party," 1
John 0
Boehner 0
told 0
a 0
Mackinac, 0
Michigan, 0
gathering 0
of 0
the 0
GOP 0
faithful 0
last 0
week. 0

"The 0
Republican 0
Party 0
is 0
kind 0
of 0
taking 0
a 0
nap 0
somewhere." 0

Ex-Speaker 0
Boehner 0
should 0
probably 0
re-check 0
the 0
old 0
party's 0
pulse, 0
for 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
GOP 0
may 0
not 0
just 0
be 0
napping. 0

It 0
could 0
be 0
comatose. 1

Consider. 0

That 0
GOP 0
was 0
dedicated 0
to 0
free 0
trade, 0
open 0
borders, 0
amnesty 0
and 0
using 0
U.S. 0
power 0
to 0
punish 1
aggressors 1
and 0
"end 1
tyranny 1
in 1
our 1
world." 1

That 0
GOP 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
new 0
world 0
order 0
where 0
dictatorships 0
were 0
threatened 0
with 0
"regime 0
change," 0
and 0
democratic 0
capitalism 0
was 0
the 0
new 0
order 0
of 0
the 0
ages. 0

Yet, 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
captured 0
the 0
Republican 0
nomination 0
and 0
won 0
the 0
presidency—by 0
saying 0
goodbye 0
to 0
all 0
that. 0

How 0
probable 0
is 0
it 0
that 0
a 0
future 0
GOP 0
presidential 0
candidate 0
will 0
revive 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
agenda 0
the 0
party 0
rejected 0
in 0
2016, 0
run 0
on 0
it, 0
win, 0
and 0
impose 0
it 0
on 0
the 0
party 0
and 0
nation? 0

Bush-Boehner 0
Republicanism 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
dead 1
today 0
as 0
was 0
Harding-Coolidge 0
Republicanism 0
after 0
1933. 0

And 0
if 1
Trumpism 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
future 1
of 1
the 1
GOP, 1
it 1
is 1
hard 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
a 1
promising 1
GOP 1
agenda 1
might 1
look 1
like. 1

A 0
brief 0
history: 0
In 0
seven 0
elections 0
starting 0
in 0
1992, 0
Republicans 0
won 0
the 0
presidency 0
three 0
times, 0
but 0
the 0
popular 0
vote 0
only 0
once, 0
in 0
2004, 0
when 0
George 0
W. 0
was 0
still 0
basking 0
in 0
his 0
"Mission 0
Accomplished" 0
in 0
Iraq. 0

What 0
fractured 0
and 0
overwhelmed 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
Republican 0
Party? 0

First, 0
demography. 0

The 0
mass 0
immigration 0
of 0
Third 0
World 0
peoples 0
that 0
began 0
with 0
the 0
1965 0
immigration 0
act, 0
and 0
the 0
decline 0
in 0
the 0
birth 0
rate 0
of 0
native-born 0
Americans, 0
began 0
to 0
swamp 0
the 0
Nixon-Reagan 0
New 0
Majority. 0

Second, 0
the 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
Soviet 1
Empire 1
and 0
USSR 0
removed 0
the 0
party's 0
great 1
unifying 0
cause 0
from 0
Eisenhower 0
to 0
Bush 0
I—the 0
Cold 0
War. 0

After 0
the 0
Red 0
Army 0
went 0
home, 0
"America 1
First" 1
had 0
a 0
new 0
appeal! 0

Third, 0
faithful 0
to 0
the 0
free 0
trade 0
cult 1
in 0
which 0
they 0
were 0
raised, 0
Republicans 0
championed 0
NAFTA, 0
the 0
WTO, 0
and 0
MFN 0
for 0
China. 0

Historians 0
will 0
look 0
back 0
in 0
amazement 0
at 0
how 0
America's 0
free 0
trade 0
zealots 1
gave 0
away 0
the 0
greatest 0
manufacturing 0
base 0
the 0
world 0
had 0
ever 0
seen, 0
as 0
they 0
quoted 0
approvingly 0
18th- 0
and 0
19th-century 0
scribblers 0
whose 0
ideas 0
had 0
done 0
so 0
much 0
to 0
bring 0
down 0
their 1
own 1
country, 1
Great 1
Britain. 1

Between 0
1997 0
and 0
2017, 0
the 0
EU 0
ran 0
up, 0
at 0
America's 0
expense, 0
trade 0
surpluses 0
in 0
goods 0
in 0
excess 0
of 0
$2 0
trillion, 0
while 0
we 0
also 0
picked 0
up 0
the 0
bill 0
for 0
Europe's 0
defense. 0

Between 0
1992 0
and 0
2016, 0
China 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
run 1
$4 1
trillion 1
in 1
trade 1
surpluses 1
at 1
our 1
expense, 1
converting 1
herself 1
into 1
the 1
world's 1
first 1
manufacturing 1
power 1
and 1
denuding 1
America 1
of 1
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
factories 1
and 1
millions 1
of 1
manufacturing 1
jobs. 1

In 0
Trump's 0
first 0
year, 0
China's 0
trade 0
surplus 0
with 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
hit 0
$375 0
billion. 0

From 0
January 0
to 0
March 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
our 0
trade 0
deficit 0
with 0
China 0
was 0
running 0
at 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
astronomical 0
rate. 0

"Trade 0
deficits 0
do 0
not 0
matter," 0
we 0
hear 0
from 0
the 0
economists. 0

They 0
might 0
explain 0
that 0
to 0
Ohio, 0
Michigan 0
and 0
Pennsylvania. 0

And 0
perhaps 0
someone 0
can 0
explain 0
the 0
wisdom 0
of 0
handing 0
4 0
percent 0
of 0
our 0
GDP 0
each 0
year 0
to 0
an 0
adversary 0
nation, 0
as 0
U.S. 0
admirals 0
talk 0
tough 0
about 0
confronting 0
that 0
adversary 0
nation 0
over 0
islets 0
and 0
reefs 0
in 0
the 0
South 0
China 0
Sea. 0

Why 0
are 0
we 0
enriching 0
and 0
empowering 0
so 0
exorbitantly 0
those 0
whom 0
we 0
are 0
told 0
we 0
may 0
have 0
to 0
fight? 0

Fourth, 0
under 0
Bush 0
II 0
and 0
Obama, 0
the 0
U.S. 0
intervened 0
massively 0
in 0
the 0
Near 0
and 0
Middle 0
East—in 0
Afghanistan, 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
Syria, 0
Yemen. 0

And 0
the 0
forces 0
that 0
pushed 0
up 0
into 0
those 0
conflicts, 0
and 0
so 1
disillusioned 1
the 1
nation 1
that 1
it 1
elected 1
Barack 1
Obama, 1
are 0
back, 0
pushing 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
war, 0
on 0
Iran. 0

They 0
may 0
get 0
this 0
war, 0
too. 0

Yet, 0
given 0
the 0
anti-interventionist 0
and 0
anti-war 0
stance 0
of 0
Trump's 0
winning 0
campaign, 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
Bernie 0
Sanders 0
campaign, 0
U.S. 0
involvement 0
in 0
Middle 0
East 0
wars 0
seems 0
less 0
America's 0
future 0
than 0
it 0
does 0
her 0
past. 0

After 0
his 0
16 0
months 0
in 0
office, 0
it 0
appears 0
as 0
though 0
the 0
Trump 0
presidency, 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
brief, 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
watershed 1
moment 1
in 1
U.S. 1
and 1
world 1
history, 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
of 1
the 1
GOP. 1

The 0
world 0
is 0
changing. 0

NATO 0
and 0
the 0
EU 0
are 0
showing 0
their 0
age. 0

Nationalism, 0
populism 0
and 0
tribalism 0
are 0
pervasive 0
on 0
the 0
Old 0
Continent. 0

And 0
America's 0
willingness 0
to 0
bear 0
the 0
burden 0
of 0
Europe's 0
defense, 0
as 0
they 0
ride 0
virtually 0
free, 0
is 0
visibly 0
waning. 0

It 0
is 0
hard 0
to 0
see 0
why 0
or 0
how 0
Republicans 0
are 0
ever 0
again 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
party 0
that 0
preceded 0
the 0
rise 0
of 0
Trump. 0

What 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
argument 0
for 0
returning 0
to 0
a 0
repudiated 1
platform? 0

Trump 0
not 0
only 0
defeated 0
16 0
Bush 0
Republicans, 0
he 0
presented 0
an 0
agenda 0
on 0
immigration, 0
border 0
security, 0
amnesty, 0
intervention 0
abroad, 0
the 0
Middle 0
East, 0
NAFTA, 0
free 0
trade, 0
Putin 0
and 0
Russia 0
that 0
was 0
a 0
rejection 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
Party 0
had 0
stood 0
for 0
and 0
what 0
its 0
presidential 0
candidates 0
in 0
2008 0
and 0
2012, 0
John 0
McCain 0
and 0
Mitt 0
Romney, 0
had 0
run 0
on. 0

If 0
the 0
Republican 0
Party 0
is 0
"napping," 0
let 0
it 0
slumber 0
on, 0
undisturbed, 0
for 0
its 1
time 1
has 1
come 1
and 1
gone. 1

We 0
are 0
in 0
a 0
new 0
world 0
now. 0
