The 0 9 4
Sun 0 9 4
Online 0 9 4
the 1 9 4
crisis 1 9 4
in 1 9 4
Madagascar 1 9 4
had 1 9 4
yet 1 9 4
to 1 9 4
peak. 1 9 4

He 0 9 5
also 0 9 5
sounded 1 9 5
the 1 9 5
alarm 1 9 5
to 0 9 5
neighboring 0 9 5
countries. 0 9 5

Since 0 9 6
there 0 9 6
are 0 9 6
regular 0 9 6
flights 0 9 6
in 0 9 6
and 0 9 6
out 0 9 6
of 0 9 6
Madagascar 0 9 6
and 0 9 6
this 0 9 6
outbreak 0 9 6
has 0 9 6
so 0 9 6
far, 0 9 6
been 0 9 6
impossible 0 9 6
to 0 9 6

other 0 9 6

are 0 9 6

operations, 0 9 7
said: 0 9 7
“With 0 9 7
anything 0 9 7
like 0 9 7
this 0 9 7
there 0 9 7
is 0 9 7
a 0 9 7
possibility 0 9 7
that 0 9 7
somebody 0 9 7
could 0 9 7
be 0 9 7
infected 0 9 7
and 0 9 7
get 0 9 7
on 0 9 7
a 0 9 7
plane. 0 9 7

We 0 9 8
have 0 9 8
done 0 9 8
preparedness 0 9 8
support 0 9 8
to 0 9 8
some 0 9 8
of 0 9 8
the 0 9 8
neighboring 0 9 8
countries.” 0 9 8
Tourists 0 9 8
have 0 9 8
been 0 9 8
warned 0 9 8
to 0 9 8
stay 0 9 8
out 0 9 8
of 0 9 8
Madagascar 0 9 8
until 0 9 8
doctors 0 9 8
can 0 9 8
get 0 9 8
the 0 9 8
plague 0 9 8
under 0 9 8
control 0 9 8
to 0 9 8
prevent 0 9 8
its 0 9 8
spread. 0 9 8

The 0 9 9
outbreak 0 9 9
is 0 9 9
considered 0 9 9
a 0 9 9
much 0 9 9
bigger 0 9 9
threat 0 9 9
to 0 9 9
the 0 9 9
region 0 9 9
than 0 9 9
in 0 9 9
previous 0 9 9
years 0 9 9
because 0 9 9
it 0 9 9
has 0 9 9
taken 0 9 9
on 0 9 9
its 0 9 9
pneumonic 0 9 9
form. 0 9 9

That 0 9 10
means 0 9 10
it 0 9 10
is 0 9 10
airborne 0 9 10
and 0 9 10
spread 0 9 10
by 0 9 10
sneezing 0 9 10
and 0 9 10
coughing. 0 9 10

Not 0 9 11
only 0 9 11
that, 0 9 11
but 0 9 11
the 0 9 11
plague 0 9 11
has 0 9 11
a 0 9 11
very 0 9 11
short 0 9 11
incubation 0 9 11
time. 0 9 11

Once 0 9 12
exposed, 0 9 12
some 0 9 12
people 0 9 12
will 0 9 12
die 0 9 12
within 0 9 12
24 0 9 12
hours. 0 9 12

Experts 0 9 13
say 0 9 13
the 1 9 13
epidemic 1 9 13
could 1 9 13
still 1 9 13
worsen 1 9 13
as 0 9 13
the 0 9 13
death 0 9 13
tolls 0 9 13
hit 0 9 13
124 0 9 13
and 0 9 13
more 0 9 13
than 0 9 13
1,300 0 9 13

left 0 9 13
infected. 0 9 13

The 0 9 14
World 0 9 14
Health 0 9 14
Organization 0 9 14
(WHO) 0 9 14
has 0 9 14
now 0 9 14
issued 0 9 14
alarming 1 9 14
warnings 1 9 14
in 0 9 14
nine 0 9 14
countries 0 9 14
too. 0 9 14

“If 0 9 15
they 0 9 15
are 0 9 15
traveling 0 9 15
shorter 0 9 15
distances 0 9 15
and 0 9 15
they’re 0 9 15
still 0 9 15
in 0 9 15
the 0 9 15
incubation 0 9 15
period, 0 9 15
and 0 9 15
they 0 9 15
have 0 9 15
the 0 9 15
pneumonic 0 9 15
(form) 0 9 15
then 0 9 15
they 0 9 15
could 0 9 15
spread 0 9 15
it 0 9 15
to 0 9 15
other 0 9 15
places,” 0 9 15
said 0 9 15

“We 0 9 16
don’t 0 9 16
want 0 9 16
to 0 9 16
have 0 9 16
a 0 9 16
situation 0 9 16
where 0 9 16
the 0 9 16
disease 0 9 16
spreads 0 9 16
so 0 9 16
fast 0 9 16
it 0 9 16
sort 0 9 16
of 0 9 16
gets 0 9 16
out 0 9 16
of 0 9 16
control. 0 9 16

Most 0 9 17
of 0 9 17
the 0 9 17
cases 0 9 17
in 0 9 17
the 0 9 17
past 0 9 17
have 0 9 17
been 0 9 17
of 0 9 17
the 0 9 17
bubonic 0 9 17
plague 0 9 17
but 0 9 17
if 0 9 17
you 0 9 17
look 0 9 17
at 0 9 17
this 0 9 17
particular 0 9 17
outbreak, 0 9 17
70 0 9 17
percent 0 9 17
of 0 9 17
the 0 9 17
cases 0 9 17
are 0 9 17
pneumonic 0 9 17
plague, 0 9 17
which 0 9 17
is 0 9 17
the 0 9 17
most 0 9 17
deadly 0 9 17
form 0 9 17
of 0 9 17
the 0 9 17
disease. 0 9 17

If 1 9 18
the 1 9 18
treatment 1 9 18
is 1 9 18
not 1 9 18
given 1 9 18
in 1 9 18
a 1 9 18
very 1 9 18
short 1 9 18
period 1 9 18
of 1 9 18
time 1 9 18
these 1 9 18
people 1 9 18
will 1 9 18
end 1 9 18
up 1 9 18
dying.” 1 9 18

Both 0 9 19
forms 0 9 19
of 0 9 19
the 0 9 19
plague 0 9 19
can 0 9 19
be 0 9 19
cured 0 9 19
with 0 9 19
antibiotics, 0 9 19
but 0 9 19
getting 0 9 19
treatment 0 9 19
quickly 0 9 19
is 0 9 19
the 0 9 19
key 0 9 19
to 0 9 19
survival. 0 9 19
