As 0 43 2
nations 0 43 2

with 0 43 2
the 0 43 2
outbreak 0 43 2
of 0 43 2
the 0 43 2
bubonic 0 43 2
plague, 0 43 2
nine 0 43 2
countries 0 43 2
are 0 43 2
sounding 1 43 2
warnings 1 43 2
that 1 43 2
the 1 43 2
disease 1 43 2
is 1 43 2
spreading 1 43 2
rapidly. 1 43 2

The 0 43 3
deadly 0 43 3
plague 0 43 3
outbreak 0 43 3
that 0 43 3
has 0 43 3
struck 0 43 3
Madagascar’s 0 43 3

has 0 43 3
yet 0 43 3
to 0 43 3
“peak” 0 43 3
and 0 43 3
that 0 43 3
could 0 43 3
make 0 43 3
the 0 43 3

this 0 43 3

told 0 43 4
The 0 43 4
Sun 0 43 4
Online 0 43 4
the 1 43 4
crisis 1 43 4
in 1 43 4
Madagascar 1 43 4
had 1 43 4
yet 1 43 4
to 1 43 4
peak. 1 43 4

He 0 43 5
also 0 43 5
sounded 1 43 5
the 1 43 5
alarm 1 43 5
to 0 43 5
neighboring 0 43 5
countries. 0 43 5

Since 0 43 6
there 0 43 6
are 0 43 6
regular 0 43 6
flights 0 43 6
in 0 43 6
and 0 43 6
out 0 43 6
of 0 43 6
Madagascar 0 43 6
and 0 43 6
this 0 43 6
outbreak 0 43 6
has 0 43 6
so 0 43 6
far, 0 43 6
been 0 43 6
impossible 0 43 6
to 0 43 6

other 0 43 6

said: 0 43 7
“With 0 43 7
anything 0 43 7
like 0 43 7
this 0 43 7
there 0 43 7
is 0 43 7
a 0 43 7
possibility 0 43 7
that 0 43 7
somebody 0 43 7
could 0 43 7
be 0 43 7
infected 0 43 7
and 0 43 7
get 0 43 7

We 0 43 8
have 0 43 8
done 0 43 8
preparedness 0 43 8
support 0 43 8
to 0 43 8
some 0 43 8

the 0 43 8

Tourists 0 43 8
have 0 43 8

stay 0 43 8
out 0 43 8
of 0 43 8
Madagascar 0 43 8

can 0 43 8

the 0 43 8

under 0 43 8
control 0 43 8
to 0 43 8
prevent 0 43 8
its 0 43 8
spread. 0 43 8

The 0 43 9
outbreak 0 43 9
is 0 43 9
considered 0 43 9
a 0 43 9
much 0 43 9
bigger 0 43 9
threat 0 43 9
to 0 43 9
the 0 43 9
region 0 43 9
than 0 43 9
in 0 43 9
previous 0 43 9
years 0 43 9
because 0 43 9
it 0 43 9
has 0 43 9
taken 0 43 9
on 0 43 9
its 0 43 9
pneumonic 0 43 9
form. 0 43 9

That 0 43 10
means 0 43 10
it 0 43 10
is 0 43 10
airborne 0 43 10
and 0 43 10
spread 0 43 10
by 0 43 10
sneezing 0 43 10

coughing. 0 43 10

Not 0 43 11
only 0 43 11
that, 0 43 11
but 0 43 11
the 0 43 11
plague 0 43 11
has 0 43 11
a 0 43 11
very 0 43 11
short 0 43 11
incubation 0 43 11
time. 0 43 11

Once 0 43 12
exposed, 0 43 12
some 0 43 12

will 0 43 12
die 0 43 12
within 0 43 12
24 0 43 12
hours. 0 43 12

Experts 0 43 13
say 0 43 13
the 1 43 13
epidemic 1 43 13
could 1 43 13
still 1 43 13

warnings 1 43 14
in 0 43 14
nine 0 43 14
countries 0 43 14
too. 0 43 14

“If 0 43 15
they 0 43 15
are 0 43 15
traveling 0 43 15
shorter 0 43 15

they’re 0 43 15

the 0 43 15

they 0 43 15
have 0 43 15
the 0 43 15
pneumonic 0 43 15

then 0 43 15
they 0 43 15
could 0 43 15

it 0 43 15
to 0 43 15

“We 0 43 16
don’t 0 43 16

if 0 43 17
you 0 43 17
look 0 43 17
at 0 43 17
this 0 43 17
particular 0 43 17
outbreak, 0 43 17
70 0 43 17
percent 0 43 17

the 0 43 17
cases 0 43 17
are 0 43 17
pneumonic 0 43 17
plague, 0 43 17
which 0 43 17
is 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
most 0 43 17
deadly 0 43 17
form 0 43 17
of 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
disease. 0 43 17

If 1 43 18
the 1 43 18
treatment 1 43 18

Both 0 43 18
