nine 0

He 0
also 0
sounded 1
the 1

Since 0
there 0
are 0
regular 0
flights 0
in 0
and 0
out 0
of 0
Madagascar 0
and 0
this 0
outbreak 0
has 0
so 0
far, 0
been 0
impossible 0
to 0
contain, 0
other 0

Christine 0
South, 0
head 0
of 0
IFRC’s 0
(International 0

emergency 0
operations, 0
said: 0
“With 0
anything 0
like 0
this 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
that 0
somebody 0
could 0
be 0
infected 0
and 0
get 0
on 0
a 0

We 0
have 0

preparedness 0

Tourists 0
have 0

out 0

Madagascar 0
until 0
doctors 0
can 0
get 0
the 0
plague 0
under 0
control 0
to 0
prevent 0
its 0
spread. 0

The 0
outbreak 0
is 0
considered 0
a 0
much 0
bigger 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
region 0
than 0
in 0
previous 0
years 0
because 0
it 0
has 0
taken 0
on 0
its 0
pneumonic 0
form. 0

That 0
means 0
it 0
is 0
airborne 0
and 0
spread 0
by 0
sneezing 0
and 0
coughing. 0

Not 0
only 0
that, 0
but 0
the 0
plague 0
has 0
a 0
very 0
short 0
incubation 0
time. 0

Once 0
exposed, 0
some 0
people 0
will 0
die 0
within 0
24 0
hours. 0

Experts 0
say 0
the 1
epidemic 1
could 1
still 1
worsen 1
as 0
the 0
death 0

hit 0
124 0
and 0
more 0

1,300 0

The 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
(WHO) 0
has 0
now 0
issued 0
alarming 1
warnings 1
in 0
nine 0
countries 0
too. 0

“If 0
they 0
are 0
traveling 0
shorter 0
distances 0
and 0
they’re 0
still 0
in 0
the 0
incubation 0
period, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
the 0
pneumonic 0
(form) 0
then 0
they 0
could 0
spread 0
it 0
to 0
other 0
places,” 0
said 0
Chopra. 0

“We 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
situation 0
where 0
the 0

so 0
fast 0

Most 0
of 0
the 0
cases 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
have 0
been 0
of 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
this 0
particular 0
outbreak, 0
70 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
cases 0
are 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
deadly 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
disease. 0

If 1
the 1
treatment 1
is 1
not 1
given 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
period 1
of 1
time 1
these 1

up 1

Both 0
forms 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
can 0
be 0
