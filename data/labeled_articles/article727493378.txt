Nevada 0 66 1
Coroner 0 66 1
John 0 66 1

has 0 66 1
determined 0 66 1
to 0 66 1
defy 0 66 1

Though 0 66 2
the 0 66 2
order 0 66 2
was 0 66 2
issued 0 66 2
on 0 66 2
Tuesday, 0 66 2
Fudenberg 0 66 2
conferred 0 66 2
with 0 66 2
others 0 66 2
and 0 66 2
seems 0 66 2
determined 0 66 2
to 0 66 2
not 0 66 2
release 0 66 2
the 0 66 2
autopsy 0 66 2
report 0 66 2
until, 0 66 2
as 0 66 2
he 0 66 2
said, 0 66 2
it 0 66 2
is 0 66 2
"finalized," 0 66 2
The 0 66 2
Las 0 66 2

reported, 0 66 2
which 0 66 2
sued 0 66 2
for 0 66 2
the 0 66 2
autopsy 0 66 2
report. 0 66 2

Seriously, 1 66 3
it's 0 66 3
been 0 66 3
four 0 66 3
months 0 66 3
already! 0 66 3

The 0 66 4
body 0 66 4
has 0 66 4
been 0 66 4
cremated! 0 66 4

The 1 66 5
family 1 66 5
finally 1 66 5
got 1 66 5
the 1 66 5
remains 1 66 5
in 1 66 5
a 1 66 5
box 1 66 5
marked 1 66 5
"evidence" 1 66 5
over 1 66 5
three 1 66 5
months 1 66 5
after 1 66 5
the 1 66 5
shooting 1 66 5
and 1 66 5
the 1 66 5
autopsy 1 66 5
report 1 66 5
hasn't 1 66 5
been 1 66 5
finalized? 1 66 5

Wait, 1 66 6
were 1 66 6
the 1 66 6
same 1 66 6
guys 1 66 6
in 1 66 6
the 1 66 6
autopsy 1 66 6
room 1 66 6
that 1 66 6
were 1 66 6
there 1 66 6
when 1 66 6

rotten 1 66 17

apparently 1 66 18
at 1 66 18
