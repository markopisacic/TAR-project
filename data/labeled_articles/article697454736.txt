AAS. 0 27 6
Mr. 1 27 6
Ferrara, 1 27 6
however, 1 27 6
bases 1 27 6
his 1 27 6
critique 1 27 6
upon 1 27 6
an 1 27 6
assumption 1 27 6
that 1 27 6
the 1 27 6
“generous 1 27 6
response” 1 27 6
offered 1 27 6
to 1 27 6
God 1 27 6
is 1 27 6
a 1 27 6

sin. 1 27 7
This, 1 27 7
though, 1 27 7
is 1 27 7
not 1 27 7
what 1 27 7
AL 1 27 7
is 1 27 7
saying. 1 27 7

The 0 27 8
generous 0 27 8
response 0 27 8
is 0 27 8
a 0 27 8
move 0 27 8
away 0 27 8
from 0 27 8
sin 0 27 8
and 0 27 8
a 0 27 8
move 0 27 8
toward 0 27 8

God. 0 27 9

theologian 0 27 11
and 0 27 11
a 0 27 11
fine 0 27 11
man, 0 27 11
but 0 27 11
he 0 27 11
still 0 27 11
seems 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
believe 0 27 11
that 0 27 11
AL 0 27 11

implies 0 27 11
that 0 27 11
God 0 27 11
is 0 27 11
asking 0 27 11

In 0 27 12
his 0 27 12
April 0 27 12

2016 0 27 12
article 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
Catholic 0 27 12
World 0 27 12
Report, 0 27 12
Brugger 0 27 12
writes 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
AL 0 27 12
303 0 27 12
suggests 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
“God 0 27 12
can 0 27 12
be 0 27 12
‘asking’ 0 27 12
someone 0 27 12

live 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
a 0 27 12
life-state 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
which 0 27 12
they 0 27 12
are 0 27 12
objectively 0 27 12
violating 0 27 12
grave 0 27 12
matter.” 0 27 12
Then 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
a 0 27 12
Sept. 0 27 12
28 0 27 12
‘17 0 27 12
LifeSiteNews 0 27 12
article, 0 27 12
he 0 27 12
states 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
“the 0 27 12
generous 0 27 12
response” 0 27 12
owed 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
God 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
“a 0 27 12
certain 0 27 12
state 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
objectively 0 27 12
at 0 27 12
variance 0 27 12
with 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
universal 0 27 12
command 0 27 12
of 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
Gospel.” 0 27 12
Now 0 27 12
Prof. 0 27 12
Brugger 0 27 12
argues 0 27 12
that, 0 27 12
because 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
subject 0 27 12
remains 0 27 12
“this 0 27 12
conscience” 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
AL 0 27 12
303, 0 27 12
this 0 27 12
proves 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
“generous 0 27 12
offering 0 27 12
owed 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
God” 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
recognition 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
one 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
living 0 27 12
“contrary 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
“the 0 27 12
universal 0 27 12
command 0 27 12
of 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
Gospel.” 0 27 12

Prof. 0 27 13
Brugger 0 27 13
fails 0 27 13
to 0 27 13
see 0 27 13
that 0 27 13
AL 0 27 13
303 0 27 13
clearly 0 27 13
distinguishes 0 27 13
between 0 27 13
a 0 27 13
conscience’s 0 27 13
recognition 0 27 13
that 0 27 13
“a 0 27 13
given 0 27 13
situation 0 27 13
is 0 27 13
objectively 0 27 13
at 0 27 13
variance 0 27 13
with 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
general 0 27 13
mandate 0 27 13
of 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
Gospel” 0 27 13
and 0 27 13
this 0 27 13
same 0 27 13
conscience’s 0 27 13
subsequent 0 27 13
recognition 0 27 13
of 0 27 13
a 0 27 13
“generous 0 27 13
response 0 27 13
owed 0 27 13
to 0 27 13
God 0 27 13
in 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
present 0 27 13
circumstances.” 0 27 13
The 0 27 13
subject 0 27 13
“conscience” 0 27 13
might 0 27 13
be 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
same 0 27 13
but 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
object 0 27 13
is 0 27 13
different. 0 27 13

The 0 27 14
“generous 0 27 14
response” 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
not 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
situation 0 27 14
that 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
at 0 27 14
variance 0 27 14
with 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
command 0 27 14
of 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
Gospel 0 27 14
but 0 27 14
an 0 27 14
offering 0 27 14
that 0 27 14
God 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
asking 0 27 14
amid 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
mass 0 27 14
of 0 27 14
impediments 0 27 14
even 0 27 14
though 0 27 14
it 0 27 14
may 0 27 14
not 0 27 14
yet 0 27 14
be 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
perfect 0 27 14
objective 0 27 14

model. 0 27 15
What 0 27 15
might 0 27 15
be 0 27 15
this 0 27 15
“generous 0 27 15
response?” 0 27 15
Pope 0 27 15
Francis 0 27 15
does 0 27 15
not 0 27 15
give 0 27 15
an 0 27 15
example 0 27 15
in 0 27 15
AL 0 27 15
303 0 27 15
because 0 27 15
he’s 0 27 15
speaking 0 27 15
in 0 27 15
general 0 27 15
terms 0 27 15
of 0 27 15
the 0 27 15
dynamics 0 27 15
of 0 27 15
conscience. 0 27 15

Moreover, 0 27 16
he 0 27 16
knows 0 27 16
that 0 27 16
concrete 0 27 16
cases 0 27 16
vary 0 27 16

widely. 0 27 17
In 0 27 17
our 0 27 17
Sept. 0 27 17
26 0 27 17
article 0 27 17
in 0 27 17

Stampa, 0 27 17
Dr. 0 27 17
Goldstein 0 27 17
and 0 27 17
I 0 27 17
provided 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
hypothetical 0 27 17
example 0 27 17
of 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
couple 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
purely 0 27 17
civil 0 27 17
“marriage” 0 27 17
recognizing 0 27 17
that 0 27 17
God 0 27 17
is 0 27 17
calling 0 27 17
them 0 27 17
to 0 27 17
live 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
continence. 0 27 17

We 0 27 18
chose 0 27 18
this 0 27 18
example 0 27 18
deliberately 0 27 18
to 0 27 18
demonstrate 0 27 18
that 0 27 18
“the 0 27 18
generous 0 27 18
response” 0 27 18
could 0 27 18
be 0 27 18
the 0 27 18
ending 0 27 18
of 0 27 18
a 0 27 18
particular 0 27 18

sin. 0 27 19
Our 0 27 19
example 0 27 19
was 0 27 19
an 0 27 19
attempt 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
show 0 27 19
that 0 27 19
Professors 0 27 19
Brugger 0 27 19
and 0 27 19
Seifert 0 27 19
are 0 27 19
wrong 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
believe 0 27 19
AL 0 27 19
303 0 27 19
implies 0 27 19
that 0 27 19
God 0 27 19
is 0 27 19
asking 0 27 19
some 0 27 19
people 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
continue 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
live 0 27 19
in 0 27 19
an 0 27 19
objectively 0 27 19
sinful 0 27 19

state. 0 27 20
It’s 0 27 20
really 0 27 20
just 0 27 20
the 0 27 20
opposite. 0 27 20

AL 0 27 21
303 0 27 21
teaches 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
conscience 0 27 21
will 0 27 21
come 0 27 21
to 0 27 21
recognize 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
God 0 27 21
is 0 27 21
asking 0 27 21
for 0 27 21
a 0 27 21
step 0 27 21
in 0 27 21
the 0 27 21
right 0 27 21
direction 0 27 21
away 0 27 21
from 0 27 21

sin. 0 27 22
Pope 1 27 22
Francis 1 27 22
explains 1 27 22
this 1 27 22
again 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
AL 1 27 22
305 1 27 22
when 1 27 22
he 1 27 22
says 1 27 22
“a 1 27 22
small 1 27 22
step, 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
the 1 27 22
midst 1 27 22
of 1 27 22
great 1 27 22
human 1 27 22
limitations, 1 27 22
can 1 27 22
be 1 27 22
more 1 27 22
pleasing 1 27 22
to 1 27 22
God 1 27 22
than 1 27 22
a 1 27 22
life 1 27 22
which 1 27 22
appears 1 27 22
outwardly 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
order, 1 27 22
but 0 27 22
moves 0 27 22
through 0 27 22
the 0 27 22
day 0 27 22
without 0 27 22
confronting 0 27 22
great 0 27 22
difficulties.’” 0 27 22

In 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
recent 0 27 23
interview 0 27 23
(http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
Italian 0 27 23
philosopher, 0 27 23
Rocco 0 27 23
Buttiglione, 0 27 23
provides 0 27 23
this 0 27 23
example 0 27 23
for 0 27 23
AL 0 27 23
303: 0 27 23
“Imagine 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
father 0 27 23
who 0 27 23
has 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
sick 0 27 23
son 0 27 23
and 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
child 0 27 23
improves. 0 27 23

He 0 27 24
still 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
fever 0 27 24
but 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
stopped 0 27 24
vomiting; 0 27 24
the 0 27 24
child 0 27 24
manages 0 27 24
to 0 27 24
keep 0 27 24
in 0 27 24
his 0 27 24
stomach 0 27 24
what 0 27 24
he 0 27 24
eats 0 27 24
and 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
started 0 27 24
a 0 27 24
therapy 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
seems 0 27 24

to 0 27 25
work. 0 27 25
The 0 27 25
father 0 27 25
is 0 27 25

happy. 0 27 26
Is 0 27 26
he 0 27 26
happy 0 27 26
about 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
fact 0 27 26
that 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
child 0 27 26

is 0 27 27
sick? 0 27 27
No, 0 27 27
he 0 27 27
is 0 27 27
pleased 0 27 27
that 0 27 27
his 0 27 27
son 0 27 27
gives 0 27 27
symptoms 0 27 27
of 0 27 27
improvement 0 27 27
and 0 27 27
healing.” 0 27 27

This 0 27 28
is 0 27 28
what 0 27 28
Pope 0 27 28
Francis 0 27 28
is 0 27 28

with 0 27 29
the 0 27 29

intensifies 0 27 36

them. 0 27 37
With 1 27 37
all 1 27 37
due 1 27 37
respect 1 27 37
to 1 27 37
Dr. 1 27 37
Fastiggi, 1 27 37

argument 1 27 37
and 1 27 37
that 1 27 37

a 1 27 37
“move 1 27 37

is 1 27 37
what 1 27 37
is 1 27 37
pleasing 1 27 37
to 1 27 37

the 1 27 37
moral 1 27 37
norm 1 27 37

not 1 27 37
adhered 1 27 37
to, 1 27 37
is 1 27 37

sophistical. 1 27 38
What 0 27 38
constitutes 0 27 38
a 0 27 38
“move 0 27 38

if 0 27 38
not 0 27 38
ceasing 0 27 38
to 0 27 38
commit 0 27 38

the 0 27 39
sin? 0 27 39
No 0 27 39
example 0 27 39
is 0 27 39
provided 0 27 39
in 0 27 39
AL 0 27 39
because 0 27 39

none 0 27 40
can 0 27 40
be. 0 27 40
The 0 27 40
notion 0 27 40
is 0 27 40

nonsensical. 0 27 41
Just 0 27 41
how 0 27 41
nonsensical 0 27 41
is 0 27 41
demonstrated 0 27 41
by 0 27 41
Dr. 0 27 41
Fastiggi’s 0 27 41
claim 0 27 41
that 0 27 41
by 0 27 41
“a 0 27 41
move 0 27 41
away 0 27 41
from 0 27 41
sin” 0 27 41
in 0 27 41
the 0 27 41
case 0 27 41
of 0 27 41
a 0 27 41
divorced 0 27 41
and 0 27 41
“remarried” 0 27 41
couple 0 27 41
Francis 0 27 41
means 0 27 41
their 0 27 41
agreement 0 27 41
to 0 27 41
live 0 27 41
in 0 27 41
continence 0 27 41
as 0 27 41
brother 0 27 41
and 0 27 41
sister 0 27 41
for 0 27 41
the 0 27 41
sake 0 27 41

of 0 27 42
children. 0 27 42
But 0 27 42
that 0 27 42
would 0 27 42
be 0 27 42
ceasing 0 27 42
to 0 27 42
commit 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
sin 0 27 42
of 0 27 42
adultery 0 27 42
altogether 0 27 42
as 0 27 42
it 0 27 42
would 0 27 42
involve 0 27 42
abandoning 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
pretense 0 27 42
that 0 27 42
they 0 27 42
are 0 27 42
married 0 27 42
along 0 27 42
with 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
illicit 0 27 42
sexual 0 27 42
relation 0 27 42

itself. 0 27 43
Such 0 27 43
a 0 27 43
couple 0 27 43
could 0 27 43
always 0 27 43
be 0 27 43
absolved 0 27 43
and 0 27 43
receive 0 27 43
Holy 0 27 43
Communion 0 27 43
under 0 27 43
the 0 27 43
Church’s 0 27 43
constant 0 27 43
practice, 0 27 43
albeit 0 27 43
privately 0 27 43
to 0 27 43
avoid 0 27 43

scandal. 0 27 44
At 0 27 44
any 0 27 44
rate, 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
“brother 0 27 44
and 0 27 44
sister” 0 27 44
approach 0 27 44
to 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
situation, 0 27 44
which 0 27 44
is 0 27 44
that 0 27 44
of 0 27 44
Familiaris 0 27 44
consortio 0 27 44
84, 0 27 44
is 0 27 44
certainly 0 27 44
not 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
one 0 27 44
advocated 0 27 44

by 0 27 45
Francis. 0 27 45
As 0 27 45
my 0 27 45
article 0 27 45
shows, 0 27 45
Francis 0 27 45
has 0 27 45
made 0 27 45
it 0 27 45
quite 0 27 45
clear 0 27 45
that 0 27 45
he 0 27 45
approves 0 27 45
of 0 27 45
admitting 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
the 0 27 45
sacraments 0 27 45
divorced 0 27 45
and 0 27 45
“remarried” 0 27 45
people 0 27 45
who 0 27 45
will 0 27 45
continue 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
live 0 27 45
as 0 27 45
if 0 27 45
they 0 27 45
were 0 27 45
married, 0 27 45
including 0 27 45
sexual 0 27 45
relations, 0 27 45
while 0 27 45
“discerning” 0 27 45
their 0 27 45
situation, 0 27 45
this 0 27 45
“discernment” 0 27 45
being 0 27 45
a 0 27 45
mere 0 27 45
fig 0 27 45
leaf 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
conceal 0 27 45
the 0 27 45
proposed 0 27 45
toleration 0 27 45
of 0 27 45
public 0 27 45
adultery 0 27 45
in 0 27 45

the 0 27 46
Church. 0 27 46
Thus, 0 27 46
Francis 0 27 46
thanked 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
Maltese 0 27 46
bishops 0 27 46
for 0 27 46
their 0 27 46
AL 0 27 46
guidelines, 0 27 46
which 0 27 46
literally 0 27 46
mandate 0 27 46
admission 0 27 46
to 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
sacraments 0 27 46
of 0 27 46
divorced 0 27 46
and 0 27 46
“remarried” 0 27 46

who 0 27 46
believe 0 27 46
themselves 0 27 46
to 0 27 46
be 0 27 46
“at 0 27 46
peace 0 27 46
with 0 27 46
God.” 0 27 46
And, 0 27 46
as 0 27 46
he 0 27 46
told 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
bishops 0 27 46
of 0 27 46
Buenos 0 27 46

No 0 27 47
amount 0 27 47
of 0 27 47
verbal 0 27 47
artifice 0 27 47
can 0 27 47

happening 0 27 47
in 0 27 47
the 0 27 47

great 0 27 48
disservice 0 27 48

Mr. 0 27 62
Ferrara 0 27 62
provides 0 27 62
no 0 27 62
real 0 27 62
evidence 0 27 62
for 0 27 62
his 0 27 62
claim 0 27 62
that 0 27 62
Pope 0 27 62
Francis 0 27 62
“wishes 0 27 62
the 0 27 62
bishops 0 27 62
to 0 27 62
admit 0 27 62
public 0 27 62
adulterers 0 27 62
in 0 27 62
'second 0 27 62
marriages' 0 27 62
to 0 27 62
the 0 27 62
sacraments 0 27 62
while 0 27 62
continuing 0 27 62
their 0 27 62

adulterous 0 27 63
relations.” 0 27 63
He 1 27 63
mentions 1 27 63
the 1 27 63
Holy 1 27 63
Father's 1 27 63
letter 1 27 63
to 1 27 63
the 1 27 63
Buenos 1 27 63
Aires 1 27 63
bishops, 1 27 63
but 1 27 63
he 1 27 63
fails 1 27 63
to 1 27 63
take 1 27 63
into 1 27 63
account 1 27 63
that 1 27 63
the 1 27 63
statement 1 27 63
of 1 27 63
those 1 27 63
Argentine 1 27 63
bishops 1 27 63
can 1 27 63
be 1 27 63
interpreted 1 27 63
in 1 27 63
an 1 27 63
orthodox 1 27 63
way, 1 27 63
as 0 27 63
Cardinal 0 27 63
Müller 0 27 63
told 0 27 63
Edward 0 27 63
Pentin 0 27 63
in 0 27 63
a 0 27 63
Sept. 0 27 63
28 0 27 63
interview 0 27 63
published 0 27 63
in 0 27 63
the 0 27 63
National 0 27 63

Catholic 0 27 64
Register. 0 27 64
In 0 27 64
fact 0 27 64
the 0 27 64
statement 0 27 64
of 0 27 64
the 0 27 64
Argentine 0 27 64
bishops 0 27 64
only 0 27 64
speaks 0 27 64
of 0 27 64
the 0 27 64
possibility 0 27 64
of 0 27 64
“access 0 27 64
to 0 27 64
the 0 27 64
sacraments 0 27 64
of 0 27 64
Reconciliation 0 27 64
and 0 27 64
the 0 27 64
Eucharist.” 0 27 64
This 0 27 64
could 0 27 64
reasonably 0 27 64
be 0 27 64
interpreted 0 27 64
as 0 27 64
going 0 27 64
to 0 27 64
confession 0 27 64
before 0 27 64

receiving 0 27 65
Holy 0 27 65
Communion. 0 27 65
The 0 27 65
same 0 27 65
applies 0 27 65
to 0 27 65
statements 0 27 65
of 0 27 65
Pope 0 27 65
Francis 0 27 65
and 0 27 65
Cardinal 0 27 65
Schoenborn 0 27 65

mentioned 0 27 66
by 0 27 66
Ferrara. 0 27 66
Pope 0 27 66
Francis 0 27 66
defers 0 27 66
to 0 27 66
the 0 27 66
exposition 0 27 66
of 0 27 66
Amoris 0 27 66
laetitia 0 27 66
by 0 27 66
Cardinal 0 27 66
Schoenborn 0 27 66
given 0 27 66
in 0 27 66
April 0 27 66
2016 0 27 66
when 0 27 66
the 0 27 66
exhortation 0 27 66

was 0 27 67
made 0 27 67
public. 0 27 67
I 1 27 67
have 1 27 67
read 1 27 67
the 1 27 67
Cardinal's 1 27 67
exposition 1 27 67
in 1 27 67
both 1 27 67
Italian 1 27 67
and 1 27 67
English, 1 27 67
and 1 27 67
I 1 27 67
only 1 27 67
find 1 27 67
mention 1 27 67
of 1 27 67
the 1 27 67
help 1 27 67
of 1 27 67
the 1 27 67
sacraments 1 27 67

in 1 27 68
certain 1 27 68
cases. 1 27 68
Once 0 27 68
again, 0 27 68
Mr. 0 27 68
Ferrara 0 27 68
assumes 0 27 68
this 0 27 68
means 0 27 68
access 0 27 68
to 0 27 68
Holy 0 27 68
Communion 0 27 68
without 0 27 68
prior 0 27 68

sacramental 0 27 69
confession. 0 27 69
With 0 27 69
regard 0 27 69
to 0 27 69
the 0 27 69
letter 0 27 69
thanking 0 27 69
the 0 27 69
Bishops 0 27 69
of 0 27 69
Malta, 0 27 69
it 0 27 69
should 0 27 69
be 0 27 69
noted 0 27 69
that 0 27 69
Edward 0 27 69
Pentin 0 27 69
mentions 0 27 69
a 0 27 69
letter 0 27 69
of 0 27 69
Cardinal 0 27 69
Baldiserri 0 27 69
not 0 27 69

a 0 27 70
letter 0 27 70
of 0 27 70
Pope 0 27 70
Francis. 0 27 70
Moreover, 0 27 70
this 0 27 70
letter 0 27 70
has 0 27 70
not 0 27 70
been 0 27 70
made 0 27 70
public 0 27 70
so 0 27 70
we 0 27 70
don't 0 27 70
know 0 27 70
exactly 0 27 70
what 0 27 70
it 0 27 70
says 0 27 70
other 0 27 70
than 0 27 70

an 0 27 71
expression 0 27 71
of 0 27 71
thanks. 0 27 71
This 0 27 71
seems 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
be 0 27 71
very 0 27 71
thin 0 27 71
evidence 0 27 71
for 0 27 71
claiming 0 27 71
Pope 0 27 71
Francis 0 27 71
wishes 0 27 71
the 0 27 71
bishops 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
admit 0 27 71
public 0 27 71
adulterers 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
the 0 27 71
sacraments 0 27 71
while 0 27 71
continuing 0 27 71
in 0 27 71
their 0 27 71

adulterous 0 27 72
relations. 0 27 72
As 0 27 72
a 0 27 72
lawyer, 0 27 72
Ferrara 0 27 72
should 0 27 72
have 0 27 72
a 0 27 72
better 0 27 72
sense 0 27 72
of 0 27 72
what 0 27 72

really 0 27 73
counts 0 27 73
as 0 27 73
evidence. 0 27 73
As 0 27 73
a 0 27 73
Christian, 0 27 73
he 0 27 73
should 0 27 73
also 0 27 73
be 0 27 73
mindful 0 27 73
of 0 27 73
the 0 27 73
command 0 27 73
against 0 27 73

bearing 0 27 74
false 0 27 74
witness. 0 27 74
Beyond 0 27 74
these 0 27 74
considerations, 0 27 74
I 0 27 74
wish 0 27 74
to 0 27 74
express 0 27 74
a 0 27 74
personal 0 27 74
concern 0 27 74
I 0 27 74
have 0 27 74
about 0 27 74
Mr. 0 27 74
Ferrara's 0 27 74
standing 0 27 74

in 0 27 75
the 0 27 75
Catholic 0 27 75
Church. 0 27 75
He 0 27 75
says 0 27 75
that 0 27 75
Dr. 0 27 75
Goldstein 0 27 75
and 0 27 75
I 0 27 75
are 0 27 75
“foot 1 27 75
soldiers 1 27 75
of 1 27 75
a 1 27 75
Leviathan 1 27 75
Church” 1 27 75
because 0 27 75
we 0 27 75

defend 0 27 76
the 0 27 76
Roman 0 27 76
Pontiff. 0 27 76
Does 1 27 76
Mr. 1 27 76
Ferrara 1 27 76
believe 1 27 76
that 1 27 76
the 1 27 76
Catholic 1 27 76
Church 1 27 76
under 1 27 76
Pope 1 27 76
Francis 1 27 76
is 1 27 76
a 1 27 76
“Leviathan 1 27 76
Church” 1 27 76
and 1 27 76

not 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
Catholic 1 27 77
Church? 1 27 77
If 1 27 77
this 1 27 77
is 1 27 77
so, 1 27 77
then 1 27 77
it 1 27 77
would 1 27 77
suggest 1 27 77
that 1 27 77
Mr. 1 27 77
Ferrara 1 27 77
is 1 27 77
refusing 1 27 77
submission 1 27 77
to 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
Roman 1 27 77
Pontiff 1 27 77
and 1 27 77
communion 1 27 77
with 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
members 1 27 77
of 1 27 77

the 1 27 78
Church 1 27 78
subject 1 27 78
to 1 27 78
him. 1 27 78
This, 0 27 78
though, 0 27 78
is 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
very 0 27 78
definition 0 27 78
of 0 27 78
schism 0 27 78
found 0 27 78
in 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
Catechism 0 27 78
of 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
Catholic 0 27 78
Church, 0 27 78
2089 0 27 78

and 0 27 79
the 0 27 79
1983 0 27 79
CIC 0 27 79
canon 0 27 79
751. 0 27 79
I 0 27 79
hope 0 27 79
Mr. 0 27 79
Ferrara 0 27 79
can 0 27 79
clarify 0 27 79
what 0 27 79
he 0 27 79
means 0 27 79
by 0 27 79
the 0 27 79
“Leviathan 0 27 79

Church” 0 27 80
under 0 27 80
Pope 0 27 80
Francis. 0 27 80
A 0 27 80
more 0 27 80
simple 0 27 80
question 0 27 80
to 0 27 80
him 0 27 80
would 0 27 80
be 0 27 80
this: 0 27 80
“Are 0 27 80
you 0 27 80
refusing 0 27 80
submission 0 27 80
to 0 27 80
the 0 27 80
Roman 0 27 80
Pontiff 0 27 80
or 0 27 80
communion 0 27 80
with 0 27 80
the 0 27 80

members 0 27 81
subject 0 27 81
to 0 27 81
him?” 0 27 81
I 0 27 81
apologize 0 27 81
ahead 0 27 81
of 0 27 81
time 0 27 81

if 0 27 82
I 0 27 82
misconstrued 0 27 82
his 0 27 82
words. 0 27 82
I 0 27 82
believe, 0 27 82
though, 0 27 82
my 0 27 82
question 0 27 82
is 0 27 82
reasonable 0 27 82
in 0 27 82
light 0 27 82
of 0 27 82
his 0 27 82
reference 0 27 82
to 0 27 82
a 0 27 82
“Leviathan 0 27 82
Church” 0 27 82
distinct 0 27 82
from 0 27 82
“the 0 27 82
dictates 0 27 82
of 0 27 82

the 0 27 83
Immortal 0 27 83

If 0 27 84
Dr. 0 27 84

a 0 27 84
growing 0 27 84
mountain 0 27 84
of 0 27 84
evidence, 0 27 84
that 0 27 84

has 0 27 84
not 0 27 84
in 0 27 84

of 0 27 84

with 0 27 84
the 0 27 84
woman 0 27 84
he 0 27 84
telephoned 0 27 84

I 0 27 85
cannot 0 27 85
help 0 27 85
him. 0 27 85
As 0 27 85
for 0 27 85
my 0 27 85
metaphorical 0 27 85

I 0 27 85
am 0 27 85
afraid 0 27 85
Dr. 1 27 85
Fastiggi 1 27 85
has 1 27 85
succumbed 1 27 85
to 1 27 85
an 1 27 85

unfortunate 1 27 86
literal-mindedness. 1 27 86
To 0 27 86
make 0 27 86
it 0 27 86
clear 0 27 86
for 0 27 86
him, 0 27 86
I 0 27 86
am 0 27 86
contending 0 27 86
that 0 27 86
he 0 27 86
and 0 27 86
his 0 27 86
co-author 0 27 86
treat 0 27 86
the 0 27 86
Pope 0 27 86
as 0 27 86
if 0 27 86
he 0 27 86

the 0 27 86
absolute 0 27 86

ruler 0 27 87
of 0 27 87
Hobbes’s 0 27 87
Leviathan. 0 27 87
I 0 27 87
do 0 27 87
not, 0 27 87
as 0 27 87
should 0 27 87
be 0 27 87
obvious, 0 27 87
argue 0 27 87
that 0 27 87
this 0 27 87
Leviathan 0 27 87

Church 0 27 88
actually 0 27 88
exists. 0 27 88
That 0 27 88
it 0 27 88
does 0 27 88
not 0 27 88
and 0 27 88
cannot 0 27 88

exist 0 27 89

“standing 0 27 89

pronounced 1 27 89
lack 1 27 89
of 1 27 89

pertinent 1 27 89
ecclesiological 1 27 89

objections 0 27 90

has 0 27 90
not, 0 27 90
at 0 27 90
any 0 27 90
rate, 0 27 90
actually 0 27 90
commanded 0 27 90
