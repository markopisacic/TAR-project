The 0
purge 0
happened 0
around 0
12:30 0
p.m. 0
CST 0
with 0
mainstream 0
news 0
reports 0
launching 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
— 0
implying 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
given 0
the 0
heads 0
up 0
about 0
the 0
move. 0

In 0
a 0
statement 0
co-authored 0
by 0
Facebook 0
Head 0
of 0
Cybersecurity 0
Nathaniel 0
Gleicher 0
— 0
who 0
Caitlin 0

aptly 0
points 0
out, 0
also 0
happens 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
former 0
White 0

National 0
Security 0
Council 0
Director 0
of 0
Cybersecurity 0
Policy 0
— 0
the 0
massive 0
social 0
media 0
platform 0
explained 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
removed 0
“559 0
Pages 0
and 0
251 0
accounts 0
that 0
have 0
consistently 0
broken 0
our 0
rules 0
against 0
spam 0
and 0
coordinated 0
inauthentic 0
behavior.” 0

Facebook 0
said 0
the 0
pages 0
were 0
“working 0
to 0
mislead 0
others 0
about 0
who 0
they 0
are, 0
and 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
doing.” 0
However, 0
this 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
further 0
from 0
the 0
truth. 0

Our 0
names, 0
addresses, 0
and 0
phone 0
numbers 0
were 0
on 0
all 0
of 0
our 0
pages 0
and 0
our 0
profiles. 0

“We 0
were 0
verified 0
by 0
Facebook 0
with 0
a 0
little 0
check 0
mark 0
next 0
to 0
our 0
name, 0
so 0
they 0
know 0
we 0
are 0
a 0
legitimate 0
organization/outlet. 0

They 0
have 0
seen 0
our 0
“Articles 0
of 0
Organization” 0
which 0
was 0
issued 0
by 0
the 0
state 0
of 0
Louisiana, 0
which 0
is 0
where 0
my 0
partner 0
and 0
The 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
co-founder 0
lives,” 0
Jason 0
Bassler, 0
co-founder 0
of 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
explained. 0

However, 0
in 0
their 0
statement, 0
Facebook 0
then 0
suggested 0
the 0
real 0
reason 0
behind 0
the 0
purge 0
— 0
elections 0
are 0
coming 0
— 0
and 0
pesky 1
folks 1
like 0
the 0
independent 0
media 0
have 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
reporting 0
information 0
on 0
candidates 0
that 0
the 0
mainstream 0
tends 0
to 0
ignore 0
— 0
like 0
war, 0
corruption, 0
and 0
most 0
recently, 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
disdain 0
for 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

“Given 0
the 0
activity 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
— 0
and 0
its 0
timing 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
midterm 0
elections 0
— 0
we 0
wanted 0
to 0
give 0
some 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
types 0
of 0
behavior 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
this 0
action,” 0
Facebook 0
said, 0
before 0
accusing 0
us 0
of 0
hawking 0
fake 0
products 0
or 0
functioning 0
as 0
ad 0
farms 0
that 0
tricked 0
“people 0
into 0
thinking 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
forums 0
for 0
legitimate 0
political 0
debate.” 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
stated 0
that 0
TFTP 0
never 0
hid 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
worked 0
with 0
other 0
independent 0
media 0
groups 0
to 0
share 0
our 0
information 0
around 0
the 0
web 0
— 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
grassroots. 0

But 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
together 0
certainly 0
posed 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
mainstream 0
so 0
this 0
nonsense 1
about 0
tricking 0
people 0
was 0
brought 0
into 0
play. 0

Within 0
all 0
of 0
our 0
pages 0
under 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
umbrella, 0
we 0
had 0
close 0
to 0
6 0
million 0
followers. 0

Does 0
Facebook 0
think 0
it 0
knows 0
better 0
than 0
the 0
6 0
million 0
people 0
who 0
clicked 0
like 0
on 0
our 0
page? 0

We 0
also 0
had 0
close 0
to 0
16,000 0
reviews 0
on 0
our 0
page 0
with 0
an 0
average 0
4.1 0
star 0
rating, 0
directly 0
showing 0
that 0
people 0
desired 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
we 0
were 0
putting 0
out. 0

The 0
only 0
ones 0
manipulating 0
people 0
here 0
are 0
the 0
tech 0
giants 0
themselves. 0

All 0
but 0
proving 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
coordinated 0
attack 0
by 0
the 0
tech 0
giant 0
community, 0
shortly 0
after 0
the 0
purge 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
Twitter 0
followed 0
suit, 0
wiping 0
out 0
our 0
profiles 0
on 0
there 0
as 0
well. 0

They 0
gave 0
absolutely 0
no 0
reason 0
for 0
the 0
suspension. 0

“This 0
signifies 0
a 0
re-consolidation 0
of 0
the 0
media. 0

Cable 0
news 0
media 0
controlled 0
the 0
narrative 0
for 0
most 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
but 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
lowered 0
that 0
barrier 0
to 0
entry 0
and 0
allowed 0
the 0
average 0
person 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
media 0
themselves. 0

This 0
obviously 0
took 0
market 0
share 0
and 0
influence 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
traditional 0
media, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
allowed 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
diverse 0
public 0
conversation. 0

Now 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
platforms 0
that 0
have 0
monopolized 0
the 0
industry 0
are 0
favoring 0
mainstream 0
sources 0
and 0
silencing 0
alternative 0
voices. 0

So 0
now, 0
instead 0
of 0
allowing 0
more 0
people 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
voice, 0
these 0
platforms 0
are 0
creating 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
where 0
only 0
powerful 0
media 0
organizations 0
are 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
had 0
on 0
cable 0
news,” 0
John 0
Vibes 0
poignantly 0
noted. 0

The 0
bottom 0
line 0
is 0
that 0
sites 0
like 0
ours 0
and 0
the 0
others 0
who 0
were 0
wiped 0
from 0
the 0
internet 0
yesterday 0
represent 0
a 0
voice 0
against 0
the 0
plutocratic 1
information-controlling 1
establishment. 1

We 0
challenge 0
their 0
paradigm 0
of 0
control 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
thorn 0
in 0
their 0
side. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
distinct 0
lines 0
between 0
social 0
media 0
giants 0
and 0
government 0
either 0
which 0
renders 0
the 0
“they 0
are 0
private, 0
they 0
can 0
do 0
what 0
they 0
wish” 0
argument 0
moot. 0

Facebook 0

arm 0

— 0
to 0
weed 0
out 0
people 0
like 0
us 0
who 0
challenge 0
the 0

quo. 0

The 0
entity 0
that 0
is 0
making 0

decisions 0
for 0

as 0
publicly 0
announced, 0
is 0
the 0

a 0
partly 0
US 0

entity. 0

At 0
what 0

will 0
the 0
extremely 0
tight 0
ties 0
between 0
these 0
companies 0
and 0
the 0

Indeed, 0
we 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
precipice 0
of 0
corporate-state 0
censorship. 0

Those 0
who 0
have 0
constantly 0
demanded 0
that 0
tech 0
giants 0
silence 0
their 0
critics 0
and 0
information 0
that 0
‘offends’ 0
them 0
are 0
finally 0
seeing 0
the 0
inevitable 1
results 0
of 0
such 0
irresponsible 1
acts. 0

As 0
we 0
have 0
been 0
pointing 0
out 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
tech 0
monopolies 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
silence 0
those 0
with 0
whom 0
you 0
disagree, 0
are 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
one 0
day 0
silence 0
you. 0

The 0
silver 0
lining 0
to 0
this 0
massive 0
purge 0
of 0
independent 0

it 0
