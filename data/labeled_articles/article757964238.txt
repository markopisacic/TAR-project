A 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
ago, 0
I 0
introduced 0
you 0
to 0
the 0
Hammon 0
family, 0
a 0
rancher 0
family 0
out 0
of 0
Oregon 0
that 0
was 0
targeted 0
after 0
the 0
patriarch 0
in 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
his 0
son 0
went 0
to 0
jail 0
for 0
doing 0
what 0
ranchers 0
do, 0
setting 0
fires 0
to 0
protect 0
property 0
and 0
livestock. 0

However, 0
in 0
the 0
day 0
and 0
age 0

unmitigated 0
"terrorism" 0
charges, 0
once 0
they 0
served 0
their 0
sentence 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
went 0
after 0
both 0
men 0
for 0
more 0
time 0
inside 0
their 0
prison 0
for 1
profit 1
system. 1

Their 0
story 0
ultimately 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
Malheur 0
Wildlife 0
Refuge 0
protest, 0
which 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
LaVoy 0
Finicum. 0

Now, 0
many 0

have 0
seen 0

in 0
the 0
Oregon 0
trials 0

Many 0
of 0

followed 0
