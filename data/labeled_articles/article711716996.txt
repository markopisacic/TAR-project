Saris 1 63 1
thinks 1 63 1
she 1 63 1
runs 1 63 1
immigration 1 63 1
policy, 1 63 1
right 0 63 1
down 0 63 1
to 0 63 1
how 0 63 1
many 0 63 1
times 0 63 1
someone 0 63 1
can 0 63 1
have 0 63 1
their 0 63 1
case 0 63 1
reviewed, 0 63 1
though 0 63 1
she 0 63 1
seems 0 63 1
confused 0 63 1
as 0 63 1
to 0 63 1
who 0 63 1
will 0 63 1
do 0 63 1
the 0 63 1
reviewing 0 63 1
of 0 63 1
those 0 63 1
cases. 0 63 1

At 0 63 2
issue 0 63 2
is 0 63 2
a 0 63 2
large 0 63 2
group 0 63 2
of 0 63 2
Indonesian 0 63 2
Chinese 0 63 2
Christians 0 63 2
who 0 63 2
fled 0 63 2
a 0 63 2
pogrom 1 63 2
in 0 63 2
Indonesia 0 63 2
directed 0 63 2
against 0 63 2
them 0 63 2
in 0 63 2
the 0 63 2
1990s. 0 63 2

The 0 63 3
Chinese 0 63 3
generally 0 63 3
filed 0 63 3
asylum 0 63 3
applications 0 63 3
after 0 63 3
arriving 0 63 3
in 0 63 3
the 0 63 3
United 0 63 3
States, 0 63 3
and, 0 63 3
importantly, 0 63 3
not 0 63 3
at 0 63 3
an 0 63 3
American 0 63 3
embassy 0 63 3
or 0 63 3
consulate 0 63 3
in 0 63 3
Indonesia 0 63 3
or 0 63 3
nearby. 0 63 3

All 0 63 4
were 0 63 4
relatively 0 63 4
wealthy 0 63 4
and 0 63 4
had 0 63 4
or 0 63 4
obtained 0 63 4
tourist 0 63 4
visas 0 63 4
to 0 63 4
the 0 63 4
United 0 63 4
States. 0 63 4

This 0 63 5
is 0 63 5
important 0 63 5
as 0 63 5
most 0 63 5
actual 0 63 5
"refugees" 0 63 5
drop 0 63 5
everything 0 63 5
to 0 63 5
flee 0 63 5
their 0 63 5
homelands 0 63 5
if 0 63 5
they 0 63 5
are 0 63 5
under 0 63 5
threat 0 63 5
of 0 63 5
death. 0 63 5

Tellingly, 1 63 6
these 1 63 6
asylum 1 63 6
applicants 1 63 6
were 1 63 6
the 1 63 6
elite 1 63 6
of 1 63 6
Indonesian 1 63 6
society, 1 63 6
because 1 63 6
their 1 63 6
higher 1 63 6
average 1 63 6
IQ, 1 63 6
than 1 63 6
the 1 63 6
rather 1 63 6
dull 1 63 6
Indonesians. 1 63 6

87 0 63 7
is 0 63 7
the 0 63 7
average 0 63 7
Indonesian 0 63 7
IQ 0 63 7
, 0 63 7
and 0 63 7
note 0 63 7
that 0 63 7
average 0 63 7
includes 0 63 7
the 0 63 7
higher 0 63 7
average 0 63 7
Chinese, 0 63 7
so 1 63 7
the 1 63 7
locals 1 63 7
really 1 63 7
are 1 63 7
a 1 63 7
dull 1 63 7
lot. 1 63 7

This 0 63 8
is 0 63 8
important 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
that 0 63 8
while 0 63 8
there 0 63 8
was 0 63 8
anti-Chinese 0 63 8
and 0 63 8
anti-Christian 0 63 8
violence, 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
non-Chinese 0 63 8
Christians 0 63 8
mostly 0 63 8
stuck 0 63 8
around, 0 63 8
though 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
Chinese 0 63 8
used 0 63 8
tourist 0 63 8
and 0 63 8
student 0 63 8
visas 0 63 8
to 0 63 8
come 0 63 8
to 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
United 0 63 8
States 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
a 0 63 8
leisurely 0 63 8
manner, 0 63 8
taking 0 63 8
time 0 63 8
to 0 63 8
either 0 63 8
bring 0 63 8
or 0 63 8
otherwise 0 63 8
secure 0 63 8
their 0 63 8
wealth 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
Indonesia. 0 63 8

In 0 63 9
any 0 63 9
event, 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
persecution 0 63 9
was 0 63 9
limited 0 63 9
in 0 63 9
time 0 63 9
and 0 63 9
duration 0 63 9
as 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
local 0 63 9
elite 0 63 9
know 0 63 9
they 0 63 9
need 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
Chinese 0 63 9
to 0 63 9
run 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
economy 0 63 9
and 0 63 9
to 0 63 9
avoid 0 63 9
Red 1 63 9
China 1 63 9
intervening 0 63 9
on 0 63 9
behalf 0 63 9
of 0 63 9
their 0 63 9
fellow 0 63 9
ethnics. 0 63 9

In 0 63 10
the 0 63 10
United 0 63 10
States, 0 63 10
these 0 63 10
Chinese 0 63 10
went 0 63 10
through 0 63 10
the 0 63 10
liberal 0 63 10
asylum 0 63 10
process, 0 63 10
but 0 63 10
did 0 63 10
not 0 63 10
manage 0 63 10
to 0 63 10
fool 1 63 10
even 1 63 10
the 1 63 10
credulous 1 63 10
"judges" 1 63 10
at 0 63 10
the 0 63 10
Executive 0 63 10
Office 0 63 10
for 0 63 10
Immigration 0 63 10
Review 0 63 10
(EOIR), 0 63 10
the 0 63 10
immigration 0 63 10
courts. 0 63 10

Fast 0 63 11
forward 0 63 11
to 0 63 11
the 0 63 11
Obama 0 63 11
Regime 0 63 11
Administrative 0 63 11
Amnesty 0 63 11
, 0 63 11
where 0 63 11
despite 0 63 11
outstanding 0 63 11
deportation 0 63 11
orders, 0 63 11
these 0 63 11
illegal 0 63 11
aliens, 0 63 11
among 0 63 11
millions 0 63 11
of 0 63 11
others, 0 63 11
are 0 63 11
allowed 0 63 11
to 0 63 11
remain, 0 63 11
and 0 63 11
then 0 63 11
given 0 63 11
employment 0 63 11
authorization 0 63 11
as 0 63 11
well. 0 63 11

Fortunately, 1 63 12
elections 1 63 12
have 1 63 12
consequences, 1 63 12
and 1 63 12
the 1 63 12
Obama 1 63 12
Regime 1 63 12
Administrative 1 63 12
Amnesty, 1 63 12
or 1 63 12
parts 1 63 12
of 1 63 12
it, 1 63 12
came 1 63 12
to 1 63 12
an 1 63 12
inglorious 1 63 12
end. 1 63 12

And 0 63 13
end 0 63 13
it 0 63 13
was 0 63 13
for 0 63 13
this 0 63 13
particular 0 63 13
lot 0 63 13
of 0 63 13
illegal 0 63 13
aliens. 0 63 13

But 0 63 14
Kritarch 0 63 14
Patti 0 63 14
Saris 0 63 14
was 0 63 14
having 0 63 14
none 0 63 14
of 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
immigration 0 63 14
laws 0 63 14
of 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
United 0 63 14
States. 0 63 14

She 0 63 15
thought 0 63 15
she 0 63 15
was 0 63 15
decider-in-chief 1 63 15
on 1 63 15
who 1 63 15
gets 1 63 15
deported. 1 63 15

And 0 63 16
all 0 63 16
on 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
flimsy 0 63 16
excuse 0 63 16
that 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
aliens 1 63 16
need 0 63 16
another 1 63 16
bite 1 63 16
at 1 63 16
the 1 63 16
apple, 1 63 16
despite 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
clear 0 63 16
fact 0 63 16
that 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
Indonesian 0 63 16
government 0 63 16
had 0 63 16
long 0 63 16
ago 0 63 16
quashed 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
ethnic 0 63 16
riots 0 63 16
directed 0 63 16
against 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
market 0 63 16
dominant 0 63 16
minority 0 63 16
of 0 63 16
Chinese 0 63 16
and 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
religious 0 63 16
motivated 0 63 16
violence 0 63 16
against 0 63 16
Christians. 0 63 16

While 0 63 17
there 0 63 17
are 0 63 17
a 0 63 17
couple 0 63 17
of 0 63 17
provinces 0 63 17
in 0 63 17
Indonesia 0 63 17
that 0 63 17
impose 0 63 17
Sharia 0 63 17
law 0 63 17
on 0 63 17
Muslims, 0 63 17
most 0 63 17
non-Muslims 0 63 17
are 0 63 17
exempt. 0 63 17

As 0 63 18
moderates 0 63 18
go, 0 63 18
Indonesia 0 63 18
is 0 63 18
about 0 63 18
as 0 63 18
close 0 63 18
as 0 63 18
it 0 63 18
gets 0 63 18
to 0 63 18
moderate 0 63 18
Muslims. 0 63 18

Mostly 0 63 19
because 0 63 19
the 1 63 19
country 1 63 19
would 1 63 19
not 1 63 19
last 1 63 19
long 1 63 19
without 1 63 19
an 1 63 19
outside 1 63 19
high 1 63 19
IQ 1 63 19
elite 1 63 19
to 1 63 19
run 1 63 19
the 1 63 19
country. 1 63 19

Before 0 63 20
it 0 63 20
was 0 63 20
the 0 63 20
high 0 63 20
IQ 0 63 20
Dutch, 0 63 20
now 0 63 20
it's 0 63 20
the 0 63 20
Chinese. 0 63 20

Remember, 0 63 21
an 1 63 21
87 1 63 21
IQ 1 63 21
is 1 63 21
just 1 63 21
about 1 63 21
retarded. 1 63 21

a 0 63 23

that 0 63 23
conditions 0 63 23
in 0 63 23
their 0 63 23
home 0 63 23

without 0 63 24

at 0 63 24

hospitable 0 63 31
to 0 63 31
Chinese 0 63 31
Christians 0 63 31
today 0 63 31

the 0 63 31
short 0 63 31
period 0 63 31
in 0 63 31
the 0 63 31

when 0 63 31
there 0 63 31
