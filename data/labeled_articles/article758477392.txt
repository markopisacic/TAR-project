The 0

its 0
personnel 0

their 0
families 0
reported 0
experiencing 0
a 0
range 0
of 0
health 1
issues. 1

Investigators 0
have 0
drawn 0
theories 0
including 0
that 0
were 0
targeted 0
by 0
sonic 1
attacks, 1
where 0
the 0
symptoms 0
included 0
dizziness, 0
headaches 0
and 0
vomiting. 0

The 0
attacks 1
can 0
sometimes 0
be 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
emitting 0
"infrasounds", 0
which 0
are 0
low 0
frequency 0
noises 0
that 0
can 0

human 0
hearing 0

they 0

Dr 0
Toby 0

told 0
the 0
New 0
Scientist 0
in 0
2017 0
that 0
an 0
infrasound 0
attack 1
wouldn't 0
be 0
"very 0
covert" 0

a 0
