official 0
Peter 0
Salama 0
said 0
the 0
spread 0
to 0
Mbandaka 0
meant 0
there 0
was 0
the 0
potential 0
for 0
an 0
“explosive 1
increase” 1
in 0
cases. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
major 0
development 0
in 0
the 0
outbreak,” 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
BBC. 0

“We 0
have 0
urban 0
Ebola, 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
different 0
animal 0
from 0
rural 0
Ebola. 0

The 1
potential 1
for 1
an 1
explosive 1
increase 1
in 1
cases 1
is 0
now 0
there.” 0
Mr 0
Salama, 0
the 0
WHO’s 0
deputy 0
director-general 0
for 0
emergency 0
preparedness 0
and 0
response, 0
said 0
Mbandaka’s 0
location 0
on 0
the 0
Congo 0
river, 0
widely 0
used 0
for 0
transportation, 0
raised 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
Ebola 0
spreading 0
to 0
surrounding 0
countries 0
such 0
as 0
Congo-Brazzaville 0
and 0
the 0
Central 0
African 0
Republic 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
downstream 0
to 0
Kinshasa, 0
a 0
city 0
of 0
10 0
million 0
people. 0

“This 0
puts 0
a 0
whole 0
different 0
lens 0
on 0
this 0
outbreak 0
and 0
gives 0
us 0
increased 0
urgency 0
to 0
move 0
very 0
quickly 0
into 0
Mbandaka 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
new 0
first 0
sign 0
of 0
transmission,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
BBC 0
adds 0
that 0
the 0
WHO 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
recommending 0
any 0
trade 0
or 0
travel 0
restrictions 0
either 0
within 0
DR 0
Congo, 0
for 0
example 0
between 0
Mbandaka 0
and 0
Kinshasa, 0
or 0
internationally. 0

But 0
Mr 0
Salama 0
said 0
that 0
13 0
countries 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
were 0
boosting 0
border 0
screening 0
measures 0
and 0
said 0
DR 0
Congo 0
itself 0
was 0
increasing 0
exit 0
screening 0
measures. 0

“The 0
good 0
news 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
DR 0
Congo 0
population 0
is 0
very 0
used 0
to 0
Ebola 0
outbreaks,” 0
he 0
added. 0

“They 0
know 0
to 0
protect 0
themselves 0
by 0
avoiding 0
mass 0
gatherings 0
and 0
mass 0
funerals. 0

They 0
know 0
as 0
well 0
that 0
traditional 0
healers 0
can 0
amplify 0
the 0
outbreak.” 0
