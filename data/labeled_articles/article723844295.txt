back 0 402 12
that 0 402 12
up, 0 402 12
it 0 402 12
seems 0 402 12
a 0 402 12
bit 0 402 12
irresponsible 0 402 12
to 0 402 12
make 0 402 12
that 0 402 12
allegation 0 402 12
so, 0 402 12
if 0 402 12
you 0 402 12

make 0 402 12

you 0 402 12
have 0 402 12
any 0 402 12
evidence 0 402 12
of 0 402 12
that, 0 402 12
I’m 0 402 12
asking 0 402 12
you 0 402 12
right 0 402 12

nothing 0 402 16

I’m 0 402 16
just 0 402 16
telling 0 402 16
you, 0 402 16
I 0 402 16

we’re 0 402 16
gonna 0 402 16

then 1 402 18
an 1 402 18

after 1 402 18
the 1 402 18
fact, 1 402 18
it 1 402 18
seems 1 402 18
to 1 402 18
me 1 402 18
that 1 402 18
at 1 402 18
a 1 402 18

of 1 402 18

yet, 1 402 18
