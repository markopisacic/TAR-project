that 0
ISIS 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
devastating 0
Las 0

ISIS 0
terrorists, 0

prior 0
to 0
the 0
attack 0
blamed 0
on 0

“Recently 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
made 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
I 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
evidence, 0
credible 0
information 0
regarding 0

through 0
the 0

that 0
ISIS 0
warnings 0
of 0
a 0
forthcoming 0
attack 0
on 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
shooting 0
make 0
a 0
terror 0
link 0
even 0
more 0
likely. 0

“Well, 0
they 0
could 0
be–lets 0
face 0
it, 0
ISIS 0
twice 0
before 0
the 0
attack, 0
ISIS 0
warned 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
attack 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
in 0
June 0
and 0
August 0
after 0
the 0
attack 0
claimed 0
responsibility 0
four 0
times. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
investigative 0
services 0
are 0
telling 0
us 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
terrorist 0
connection–lone 0
gunman, 0
again, 0
something 1
is 1
not 1
adding 1
up,” 1

replied. 0

An 0
incredulous 0
Carlson 0
asked 0
fellow 0
guest 0
Catherine 0
Lombardo, 0
a 0
lawyer 0
representing 0
families 0
affected 0
by 0
the 0
tragedy, 0
about 0
the 0
law 0

investigation 0
into 0
the 0
shooting. 0

“The 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
metro 0
police 0
department 0
have 0
been 0
conducting 0
the 0
investigation, 0
” 0
she 0
said. 0

“We’ve 0
seen 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
terrorist 0
attack, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
ask 0
with 0
all 0
due 0
respect, 0
congressman, 0
unless 0
have 0
you 0
specific 0
evidence 0
to 0
back 0
that 0
up, 0
it 0
seems 0
a 0
bit 0
irresponsible 0
to 0
make 0
that 0
allegation 0
so, 0
if 0
you 0
do, 0
or 0
make 0
that 0
assertion, 0
if 0
do 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
evidence 0
of 0
that, 0
I’m 0
asking 0
you 0
right 0
now 0
to 0
share 0
it 0
with 0
us 0
and 0
tell 0
us 0
what 0
that 0
is. 0

My 0
clients… 0
victims, 0
all 0
22,000 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
waiting 1
and 1
waiting 1
and 1
waiting 1
for 0
evidence.” 0

Perry 0
noted 0
that 0
all 1
Americans 1
are 0
still 0
lacking 0
all 0
the 0
evidence. 0

“We’ve 0
all 0
been 0
waiting, 0
and 0
I’m 0
waiting, 0
too. 0

Like 0
I 0
said, 0
nothing 0
adds 0
up, 0
but 0
I’m 0
just 0
telling 0
you, 0
I 0
have 0
received 0
what 0
I 0
feel 0
to 0
be 0
and 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
possible 0
terrorist 0
nexus, 0
and 0
we’re 0
gonna 0
have 0
to 0
wait… 0
until 0
the 0
situation 0
develops,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
lawmaker 0
said 0
he 0
wants 0
the 0
nation’s 0
counterterror 0
agencies 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
investigation. 0

“If 1
ISIS 1
warns 1
about 1
an 1
attack 1
and 1
then 1
an 1
attack 1
occurs 1
and 1
claims 1
responsibility 1
after 1
the 1
fact, 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
at 1
a 1
minimum, 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
some 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
investigation 1
to 1
clearly 1
debunk 1
that 1
claim 1
and, 1
yet, 1
it 1
hasn’t 1
happened,” 1
he 1
said. 1
