In 0
remarks 0
after 0
his 0
address, 0
reported 0
by 0
the 0
German 0
Catholic 0
newspaper 0
Die 0
Tagespost, 0
the 1
cardinal 1
made 0
it 0
clear 0
what 0
he 0
thinks 0
about 0
the 0
recently 0
presented 0
German 0
idea 0
of 0
blessing 0
homosexual 0
unions, 0
even 0
if 0
only 0
in 0
individual 0
cases: 0
“If 1
a 1
priest 1
blesses 1
a 1
homosexual 1
couple, 1
then 1
this 1
is 1
an 1
atrocity 1
at 1
a 1
holy 1
site, 1
namely, 1
to 1
approve 1
of 1
something 1
that 1
God 1
does 1
not 1
approve 1
of.” 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Tagespost 0
report, 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
said 0
in 0
his 0
address 0
that 0
he 0
regrets 0
the 0
separation 0
of 0
the 0
Church's 0
doctrinal 0
and 0
moral 0
teaching 0
and 0
called 0
Christianity 0
a 0
“theocentric 1
humanism.” 1
He 0
said 0
the 0
“submissive 1
change 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
into 1
a 1
NGO 1
for 1
the 1
embetterment 1
of 1
the 1
this-worldly 1
life 1
conditions” 1
is 1
a 1
“suicidal 1
modernization” 1
that 1
denies 1
mankind 1
the 1
Truth 1
of 1
God. 1

In 0
this 0
context, 0
the 0
German 0
cardinal 0
also 0
criticized 0
Martin 0
Luther's 0
own 0
denial 0
of 0
man's 0
free 0
will 0
and 0
his 0
teaching 0
about 0
the 0
total 0
depravity 0
of 0
man 0
that 0
separates 0
morality 0
from 0
the 0
relationship 0
with 0
God. 0

Morality, 0
Müller 0
explained, 0
is 0
rooted 0
in 0
Grace; 0
that 0
is 0
why 0
any 0
teaching 0
about 0
“rules 0
and 0
exceptions” 0
ignores 0
the 0
character 0
of 0
the 0
ethics 0
of 0
the 0
Covenant 0
and 0
of 0
Grace. 0

In 0
the 0
discussion 0
following 0
his 0
talk, 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
also 0
responded 0
to 0
questions 0
concerning 0
Pope 0
Francis' 0
post-synodal 0
exhortation, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

The 0
cardinal 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
“not 0
happy” 0
about 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
different 0
interpretations 0
of 0
this 0
papal 0
text 0
by 0
some 0
bishops' 0
conferences. 0

“In 1
dogmatic 1
questions, 1
there 1
cannot 1
be 1
a 1
plurality,” 1
he 0
added. 0

There 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
Magisterium, 1
he 1
said, 1
and 1
bishops' 1
conferences 1
can 1
only 1
decide 1
about 1
pastoral 1
questions. 1

Contradictory 0
conceptions 0
concerning 0
the 0
Sacraments, 0
said 0
the 0
cardinal, 0
lead 0
into 0
chaotic 0
conditions. 0

Thus, 0
explained 0
the 0
cardinal, 0
the 1
Sacraments 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
celebrated 1
the 1
way 1
Christ 1
Himself 1
willed 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
instituted 1
them. 1

The 0
controversial 0
eighth 0
chapter 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
understood 0
“in 0
an 0
orthodox 0
way,” 0
namely 0
that 0
“he 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
mortal 1
sin 1
cannot 1
receive 1
Holy 1
Communion.” 1
It 0
is, 0
in 0
Müller's 0
eyes, 0
the 0
pope's 0
duty 0
“to 0
unite 0
the 0
Church, 0
that 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
there 0
for.” 0
This 0
is 0
what 0
he, 0
Müller, 0
himself 0
told 0
the 0
pope: 0
when 0
the 0
bishops' 0
conferences 0
present 0
different 0
interpretations 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia, 0
the 0
Church 0
enters 0
“into 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
the 0
one 0
before 0
the 0
Reformation.” 0

Archbishop 0
Stanislav 0
Zvolensy, 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Slovakian 0
Bishops' 0
Conference 0
and 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Bratislava, 0
told 0
Die 0
Tagespost 0
that 0
Veritatis 0
Splendor 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
still 0
valid, 0
but 0
shows 0
timeless 0
truths. 0

Promulgated 0
25 0
years 0
ago, 0
the 0
encyclical 0
rejects 0
authoritatively 0
the 0
theory 0
of 0
situation 0
ethics, 0
a 0
theory 0
that 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
getting 0
again 0
much 0
attention 0
in 0
our 0
time, 0
for 0
example 0
by 0
theologians 0
such 0
as 0
Professor 0
Maurizio 0
Chiodi. 0

Professor 0
Livio 0
Melina, 0
the 0
former 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
Institute 0
for 0
Studies 0
on 0
Marriage 0
and 0
the 0
Family, 0
was 0
another 0
speaker 0
at 0
the 0
February 0
6 0
conference. 0

He 0
stressed 0
that 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
“read 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
magisterial 0
instructions 0
of 0
the 0
encyclical 0
Veritatis 0
Splendor, 0
which 0
recalls 0
the 0
connection 0
between 0
conscience 0
and 0
truth, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
necessity 0
of 0
a 0
well-formed 0
conscience.” 0
In 0
returning 0
to 0
that 0
encyclical, 0
explained 0
the 0
Italian 0
professor 0
and 0
theologian, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
could 0
be 0
given 0
a 0
hermeneutic 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
a 0
“continuity 0
with 0
the 0
Magisterium 0
of 0
the 0
Church.” 0
He 0
also 0
said: 0
“The 1
Commandments 1
are 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
Love 1
of 1
God 1
for 1
us. 1

If 1
we 1
fulfill 1
them, 1
we 1
are 1
united 1
with 1
God.” 1
