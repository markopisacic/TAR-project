Will 0
Trump 0
Continue 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
JFK 0
Cover-Up? 0

Last 0
Friday, 0
President 0
Trump 0
made 0
the 0
following 0
announcement: 0

I 0
have 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
block 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
remaining 0
JFK-assassination 0
related 0
records 0
except 0
for 0
those 0
records 0
that 0
directly 0
implicate 0
the 0
CIA 0
in 0
the 0
assassination, 0
which 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
remain 0
secret.” 0

Okay, 0
he 0
didn’t 0
really 0
put 0
it 0
like 0
that. 0

But 0
that’s 0
the 0
potential 0
and 0
likely 0
import 0
of 0
his 0
announcement, 0
which 0
actually 0
read 0
as 0
follows: 0

Subject 0
to 0
the 0
receipt 0
of 0
further 0
information, 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
allowing, 0
as 0
President, 0
the 0
long 0
blocked 0
and 0
classified 0
JFK 0
FILES 0
to 0
be 0
opened.” 0
(Italics 0
added.) 0

The 0
operative 0
words, 0
of 0
course, 0
are: 0
“Subject 0
to 0
the 0
receipt 0
of 0
further 0
information….” 0

What 0
is 0
going 0
on 0
here? 0

Negotiations. 0

The 0
art 0
of 0
the 0
deal. 0

The 0
CIA 0
desperately 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
its 0
long-secret 0
JFK-related 0
records. 0

It 0
has 0
asked 0
Trump 0
to 0
continue 0
keeping 0
at 0
least 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
secret 0
notwithstanding 0
the 0
passage 0
of 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years 0
since 0
the 0
Kennedy 0
assassination. 0

Under 0
long-established 0
custom 0
and 0
tradition 0
in 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
when 0
someone 0
asks 0
someone 0
else 0
for 0
a 0
favor, 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
is 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
grant 0
the 0
favor 0
demands 0
something 0
in 0
return. 0

That’s 0
where 0
the 0
negotiations 0
between 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
come 0
into 0
play. 0

Trump 0
wants 0
something 0
in 0
return. 0

We 0
don’t 0
know 0
what 0
— 0
maybe 0
laying 0
off 0
on 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
— 0
but 0
his 0
announcement 0
last 0
Friday 0
is 0
obviously 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
concluding 0
steps 0
of 0
such 0
negotiations. 0

Time 0
to 0
buy 0
old 0
US 0
gold 0
coins 0

What 0
Trump 0
has 0
done 0
with 0
his 0
announcement 0
is 0
send 0
a 0
clear 0
message 0
to 0
the 0
CIA: 0
“Give 0
me 0
what 0
I 0
want 0
and 0
I’ll 0
give 0
you 0
want 0
you 0
want. 0

Otherwise, 0
I 0
will 0
let 0
all 0
your 0
cherished 1
long-secret 1
records 1
relating 0
to 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
be 0
shown 0
to 0
the 0
American 0
people.” 0

Make 0
no 0
mistake 0
about 0
it: 0
A 0
deal 0
is 0
about 0
to 0
be 0
made. 0

The 0
CIA 0
will 0
cave. 0

It 0
will 0
end 0
up 0
giving 0
Trump 0
whatever 0
it 0
is 0
he 0
wants. 0

Trump 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
driver’s 1
seat 1
because 1
the 1
CIA 1
cannot 1
afford 1
to 1
permit 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
records 1
it 1
wants 1
to 1
continue 1
to 1
be 1
kept 1
secret. 1

And 0
once 1
the 1
CIA 1
gives 1
Trump 1
what 1
he 1
wants, 1
he 1
will 1
cave 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
CIA 1
the 1
continued 1
secrecy 1
it 1
so 1
desperately 1
needs. 1

All 0
this 0
will 0
happen 0
by 0
this 0
Thursday, 0
the 0
date 0
set 0
by 0
law 0
for 0
release 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
JFK 0
records 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
not 0
blocked. 0

Think 0
about 0
it: 0
The 0
CIA 0
has 0
asked 0
the 0
president 0
to 0
continue 0
secrecy 0
of 0
records 0
that 0
are 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years 0
old 0
or, 0
apparently, 0
some 0
relating 0
to 0
secret 0
correspondence 0
between 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
1990s. 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
ground? 0

“National 0
security” 0
of 0
course, 0
the 1
two 1
most 1
important 1
and 1
meaningless 1
words 1
in 0
the 0
American 0
political 0
lexicon. 0

National 0
security? 0

Really? 0

Whatever 0
definition 0
that 0
one 0
might 0
put 0
on 0
that 0
nebulous 0
term, 0
no 1
reasonable 1
person 1
can 1
honestly 1
believe 1
that 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
50-year-old 0
records 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
result 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
falling 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
or 0
even 0
that 0
the 1
communists 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
over 1
the 1
federal 1
government. 1

The 0
CIA 0
says 0
that 0
releasing 0
its 0
decades-old 0
JFK 0
records 0
will 0
reveal 0
secret 0
“methods” 0
of 0
intelligence 0
gathering. 0

Really? 1

What, 1
like 1
the 1
CIA 1
was 1
using 1
typewriters 1
instead 1
of 1
computers 1
and 1
pay 1
telephones 1
instead 1
of 1
cell 1
phones? 1

What 0
is 0
amazing 0
(or 0
not) 0
is 0
the 1
extreme 1
nonchalance 1
of 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
to 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
continued 0
secrecy. 0

That 0
should 0
be 0
big 0
news. 0

It’s 1
essentially 1
an 1
admission 1
of 1
guilt, 1
given 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
absolutely 1
ludicrous 1
to 0
think 0
that 0
“national 0
security” 0
would 0
be 0
threatened 0
by 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
long-secret 0
JFK-assassination-related 0
records. 0

You 0
see, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
starts 0
with 0
the 0
assumption 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
assassination. 0

In 0
their 0
minds, 0
the 0
assassination 0
was 0
committed 0
by 0
a 0
lone 1
nut 1
former 1
U.S. 1
Marine 1
communist, 1
one 0
who 0
had 0
no 0
motive 0
to 0
kill 0
the 0
president. 0

Such 0
being 0
the 0
case, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
deferring 0
to 0
the 0
CIA, 0
automatically 0
concludes 0
that 0
its 0
wish 0
to 0
continue 0
keeping 0
secret 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
“national 0
security” 0
grounds 0
rather 0
than 0
an 0
attempt 0
by 0
the 0
CIA 0
to 0
continue 0
its 0
cover-up 0
of 0
its 0
assassination 0
of 0
the 0
president. 0

Let’s 0
proceed 0
from 0
the 0
opposite 0
assumption: 0
That 0
the 0
CIA, 0
in 0
partnership 0
with 0
the 0
military 0
and 0
the 0
Mafia, 0
orchestrated 0
the 0
assassination 0
by 0
framing 0
a 0
former 0
U.S. 0
Marine 0
who 0
was 0
then 0
working 0
for 0
U.S. 0
intelligence, 0
either 0
Navy 0
intelligence, 0
the 0
CIA, 0
or 0
the 0
FBI, 0
or 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
all 0
three. 0

Don’t 0
forget, 0
after 0
all, 0
that 0
that’s 0
what 0
Oswald 0
said. 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
framed. 0

Yet, 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
beginning, 0
the 1
mainstream 1
media 1
has 1
never 1
given 1
any 1
serious 1
consideration 1
to 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
framed 0
for 0
the 0
crime. 0

Instead, 0
they 0
have 0
steadfastly 0
stuck 0
with 0
the 0
official 0
story, 0
one 0
that 0
has 0
all 0
the 0
characteristics 0
of 0
a 0
pat 1
frame-up: 1
That 0
Oswald 0
acted 0
alone 0
or 0
possibly 0
acted 0
in 0
concert 0
with 0
others, 0
both 0
of 0
which 0
lead 0
to 0
nothing 0
but 0
dead 0
ends, 0
contradictions, 0
and 0
anomalies. 0

Now, 0
let’s 0
assume 0
instead 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
telling 0
the 0
truth 0
when 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
framed. 0

In 0
that 0
case, 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
imperative 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
the 0
military 0
keep 0
as 0
tight 0
a 0
lid 0
on 0
their 0
records 0
as 0
possible 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
investigators 0
or 0
investigative 0
reporters 0
would 0
have 0
a 0
difficult 0
time 0
piercing 0
through 0
to 0
the 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
that 0
establishes 0
the 0
frame-up. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
frame-up, 0
the 0
CIA 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
fortify 0
the 0
persona 0
of 0
Oswald, 0
its 0
intelligence 0
agent, 0
as 0
a 0
purported 1
communist. 1

That 1
would 1
enable 1
the 1
CIA 1
to 1
blame 1
the 1
assassination 1
on 1
a 1
communist, 1
which, 0
not 0
coincidentally, 0
was 0
the 0
advice 0
that 0
the 0
Pentagon 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
were 0
doling 0
out 0
to 0
Latin 0
American 0
military 0
dictatorships 0
at 0
the 0
School 0
of 0
the 0
Americas. 0

In 0
cases 0
of 0
covert 0
state-sponsored 0
assassinations, 0
Latin 0
American 0
regimes 0
were 0
taught, 0
a 1
good 1
strategy 1
was 1
to 1
blame 1
the 1
assassination 1
on 1
a 1
communist 1
because 1
then 1
they 1
could 1
smear 1
anyone 1
who 1
challenged 1
the 1
official 1
story 1
as 1
a 1
communist 1
sympathizer. 1

It 0
would 0
also 0
explain 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
closely 0
monitoring 0
Oswald’s 0
movements 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
assassination, 0
something 0
else 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
kept 0
secret 0
for 0
decades. 0

They 1
had 1
to 1
make 1
certain 1
that 1
Oswald 1
was 1
not 1
on 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
set 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
frame-up. 1

The 0
first 0
organization 0
that 0
came 0
out 0
with 0
a 0
press 0
release 0
advertising 0
Oswald’s 0
bona 0
fides 0
was 0
the 0
DRE, 0
an 0
anti-communist 0
group 0
in 0
New 0
Orleans 0
with 0
which 0
Oswald 0
had 0
had 0
contact. 0

What 0
no 0
one 0
knew 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
and 0
what 0
the 0
CIA 0
intentionally 0
kept 0
secret 0
for 0
decades, 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
DRE 0
was 0
a 0
CIA 0
front 0
organization. 0

It 0
was 0
being 0
generously 0
funded 0
by 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
controlled 0
by 0
a 0
secret 0
CIA 0
agent 0
named 0
George 0
Joannides, 0
which 0
the 0
CIA 0
would 0
intentionally 0
keep 0
secret 0
from 0
the 0
Warren 0
Commission 0
in 0
the 0
1960s, 0
the 0
House 0
Select 0
Committee 0
in 0
the 0
1970s, 0
and 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board 0
in 0
the 0
1990s. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
another 0
big 0
operation 0
to 0
establish 0
Oswald’s 0
communist 0
bona 0
fides 0
before 0
the 0
assassination. 0

It 0
had 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Oswald’s 0
trip 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
where 0
he 0
visited 0
the 0
Cuban 0
and 0
Soviet 0
embassies. 0

Something 1
dreadful 1
obviously 0
went 0
wrong 0
with 0
that 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
operation 0
because 0
the 0
official 0
investigation 0
into 0
it 0
was 0
quickly 0
shut 0
down 0
during 0
the 0
early 0
post-assassination 0
period. 0

Today, 0
Oswald’s 0
Mexico 0
City 0
trip, 0
which 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
those 0
CIA 0
records 0
ready 0
to 0
be 0
released, 0
is 0
still 0
shrouded 0
in 0
mystery. 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
continued 0
secrecy 0
in 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
is 0
no 0
big 0
surprise. 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
in 0
my 0
October 0
11 0
article, 0
“Will 0
Trump 0
Make 0
a 0
Deal 0
with 0
the 0
CIA 0
on 0
JFK 0
Records?,” 0
the 0
CIA 0
is 0
between 0
a 0
rock 0
and 0
a 0
hard 0
place. 0

On 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
it 1
knows 1
that 1
those 1
records 1
will 1
further 1
implicate 1
the 1
CIA 1
in 1
the 1
Kennedy 1
assassination. 1

On 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
it 0
knows 0
that 0
by 1
seeking 1
continued 1
secrecy, 1
it’s 1
essentially 1
an 1
implicit 1
acknowledgment 1
of 1
guilt. 1

Not 0
surprisingly, 0
it 0
is 0
choosing 0
the 0
latter 0
course, 0
especially 0
because 1
it 1
knows 1
that 1
its 1
assets 1
and 1
allies 1
in 1
the 1
mainstream 1
press 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
its 1
defense 1
with 0
respect 0
to 0
its 0
ridiculous 0
claim 0
of 0
“national 0
security.” 0

Do 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
long-secret 0
records 0
contain 0
a 0
video-taped 0
confession? 0

Of 0
course 0
not. 0

And 0
they 0
don’t 0
contain 0
any 0
reference 0
to 0
assassinating 0
Kennedy. 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
practice 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
beginning 0
has 0
been 0
to 0
not 0
put 0
any 0
reference 0
to 0
a 0
state-sponsored 0
assassination 0
into 0
writing. 0

But 0
there 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
reason 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
chose 0
to 0
keep 0
this 0
particular 0
batch 0
of 0
records 0
secret 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years. 0

Those 0
long-secret 0
records 0
undoubtedly 0
include 0
small 0
bits 0
of 0
important 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
that 0
fill 0
out 0
even 0
further 0
the 0
mosaic 0
of 0
a 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Dallas 0
in 0
November 0
1963, 0
the 0
same 0
types 0
of 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Iran 0
in 0
1953, 0
Guatemala 0
in 0
1954, 0
Cuba 0
in 0
1960-1963, 0
Congo 0
in 0
1961, 0
and 0
Chile 0
in 0
1973, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
the 1
CIA 1
steadfastly 1
kept 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

In 0
1953, 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
developing 0
a 0
top-secret 0
manual 0
on 0
assassinations, 0
one 0
that 0
showed 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
specializing 0
not 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
art 0
of 0
assassination 0
but 0
also 0
in 0
the 0
art 0
of 0
covering 0
up 0
its 0
role 0
in 0
state-sponsored 0
assassinations. 0

Every 1
American 1
owes 1
it 1
to 1
himself 1
to 1
read 1
that 1
manual. 1

Too 0
bad 0
the 0
mainstream 0
press 0
has 0
never 0
given 0
that 0
manual 0
the 0
consideration 0
it 0
deserves. 0

If 0
it 0
did, 0
it 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
so 0
deferential 0
to 0
the 0
deal 0
that 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
are 0
about 0
to 0
make 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
cover-up 0
by 0
continuing 0
to 1
keep 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
decades-old 1
JFK’s 1
related 1
assassination 1
records 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1
