Will 0 365 0
Trump 0 365 0
Continue 0 365 0
the 0 365 0
CIA’s 0 365 0
JFK 0 365 0
Cover-Up? 0 365 0

Last 0 365 1
Friday, 0 365 1
President 0 365 1
Trump 0 365 1
made 0 365 1
the 0 365 1
following 0 365 1
announcement: 0 365 1

I 0 365 2
have 0 365 2
decided 0 365 2
not 0 365 2
to 0 365 2
block 0 365 2
release 0 365 2
of 0 365 2
the 0 365 2
CIA’s 0 365 2
remaining 0 365 2
JFK-assassination 0 365 2
related 0 365 2
records 0 365 2
except 0 365 2
for 0 365 2
those 0 365 2
records 0 365 2
that 0 365 2
directly 0 365 2
implicate 0 365 2
the 0 365 2
CIA 0 365 2
in 0 365 2
the 0 365 2
assassination, 0 365 2
which 0 365 2
will 0 365 2
continue 0 365 2
to 0 365 2
remain 0 365 2
secret.” 0 365 2

Okay, 0 365 3
he 0 365 3
didn’t 0 365 3
really 0 365 3
put 0 365 3
it 0 365 3
like 0 365 3
that. 0 365 3

But 0 365 4
that’s 0 365 4
the 0 365 4
potential 0 365 4
and 0 365 4
likely 0 365 4
import 0 365 4
of 0 365 4
his 0 365 4
announcement, 0 365 4
which 0 365 4
actually 0 365 4
read 0 365 4
as 0 365 4
follows: 0 365 4

Subject 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
receipt 0 365 5
of 0 365 5
further 0 365 5
information, 0 365 5
I 0 365 5
will 0 365 5
be 0 365 5
allowing, 0 365 5
as 0 365 5
President, 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
long 0 365 5
blocked 0 365 5
and 0 365 5
classified 0 365 5
JFK 0 365 5
FILES 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
be 0 365 5
opened.” 0 365 5
(Italics 0 365 5
added.) 0 365 5

The 0 365 6
operative 0 365 6
words, 0 365 6
of 0 365 6
course, 0 365 6
are: 0 365 6
“Subject 0 365 6
to 0 365 6
the 0 365 6
receipt 0 365 6
of 0 365 6
further 0 365 6
information….” 0 365 6

What 0 365 7
is 0 365 7
going 0 365 7
on 0 365 7
here? 0 365 7

Negotiations. 0 365 8

The 0 365 9
art 0 365 9
of 0 365 9
the 0 365 9
deal. 0 365 9

The 0 365 10
CIA 0 365 10
desperately 0 365 10
does 0 365 10
not 0 365 10
want 0 365 10
to 0 365 10
show 0 365 10
the 0 365 10
American 0 365 10
people 0 365 10
its 0 365 10
long-secret 0 365 10
JFK-related 0 365 10
records. 0 365 10

It 0 365 11
has 0 365 11
asked 0 365 11
Trump 0 365 11
to 0 365 11
continue 0 365 11
keeping 0 365 11
at 0 365 11
least 0 365 11
some 0 365 11
of 0 365 11
them 0 365 11
secret 0 365 11
notwithstanding 0 365 11
the 0 365 11
passage 0 365 11
of 0 365 11
more 0 365 11
than 0 365 11
50 0 365 11
years 0 365 11
since 0 365 11
the 0 365 11
Kennedy 0 365 11
assassination. 0 365 11

Under 0 365 12
long-established 0 365 12
custom 0 365 12
and 0 365 12
tradition 0 365 12
in 0 365 12
Washington, 0 365 12
D.C., 0 365 12
when 0 365 12
someone 0 365 12
asks 0 365 12
someone 0 365 12
else 0 365 12
for 0 365 12
a 0 365 12
favor, 0 365 12
the 0 365 12
person 0 365 12
who 0 365 12
is 0 365 12
in 0 365 12
a 0 365 12
position 0 365 12
to 0 365 12
grant 0 365 12
the 0 365 12
favor 0 365 12
demands 0 365 12
something 0 365 12
in 0 365 12
return. 0 365 12

That’s 0 365 13
where 0 365 13
the 0 365 13
negotiations 0 365 13
between 0 365 13
Trump 0 365 13
and 0 365 13
the 0 365 13
CIA 0 365 13
come 0 365 13
into 0 365 13
play. 0 365 13

Trump 0 365 14
wants 0 365 14
something 0 365 14
in 0 365 14
return. 0 365 14

We 0 365 15
don’t 0 365 15
know 0 365 15
what 0 365 15
— 0 365 15
maybe 0 365 15
laying 0 365 15
off 0 365 15
on 0 365 15
the 0 365 15
Russia 0 365 15
investigation 0 365 15
— 0 365 15
but 0 365 15
his 0 365 15
announcement 0 365 15
last 0 365 15
Friday 0 365 15
is 0 365 15
obviously 0 365 15
part 0 365 15
of 0 365 15
the 0 365 15
concluding 0 365 15
steps 0 365 15
of 0 365 15
such 0 365 15
negotiations. 0 365 15

Time 0 365 16
to 0 365 16
buy 0 365 16
old 0 365 16
US 0 365 16
gold 0 365 16
coins 0 365 16

What 0 365 17
Trump 0 365 17
has 0 365 17
done 0 365 17
with 0 365 17
his 0 365 17
announcement 0 365 17
is 0 365 17
send 0 365 17
a 0 365 17
clear 0 365 17
message 0 365 17
to 0 365 17
the 0 365 17
CIA: 0 365 17
“Give 0 365 17
me 0 365 17
what 0 365 17
I 0 365 17
want 0 365 17
and 0 365 17
I’ll 0 365 17
give 0 365 17
you 0 365 17
want 0 365 17
you 0 365 17
want. 0 365 17

Otherwise, 0 365 18
I 0 365 18
will 0 365 18
let 0 365 18
all 0 365 18
your 0 365 18
cherished 1 365 18
long-secret 1 365 18
records 1 365 18
relating 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
the 0 365 18
JFK 0 365 18
assassination 0 365 18
be 0 365 18
shown 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
the 0 365 18
American 0 365 18
people.” 0 365 18

Make 0 365 19
no 0 365 19
mistake 0 365 19
about 0 365 19
it: 0 365 19
A 0 365 19
deal 0 365 19
is 0 365 19
about 0 365 19
to 0 365 19
be 0 365 19
made. 0 365 19

The 0 365 20
CIA 0 365 20
will 0 365 20
cave. 0 365 20

It 0 365 21
will 0 365 21
end 0 365 21
up 0 365 21
giving 0 365 21
Trump 0 365 21
whatever 0 365 21
it 0 365 21
is 0 365 21
he 0 365 21
wants. 0 365 21

Trump 1 365 22
is 1 365 22
in 1 365 22
the 1 365 22
driver’s 1 365 22
seat 1 365 22
because 1 365 22
the 1 365 22
CIA 1 365 22
cannot 1 365 22
afford 1 365 22
to 1 365 22
permit 1 365 22
the 1 365 22
American 1 365 22
people 1 365 22
to 1 365 22
see 1 365 22
the 1 365 22
records 1 365 22
it 1 365 22
wants 1 365 22
to 1 365 22
continue 1 365 22
to 1 365 22
be 1 365 22
kept 1 365 22
secret. 1 365 22

And 0 365 23
once 1 365 23
the 1 365 23
CIA 1 365 23
gives 1 365 23
Trump 1 365 23
what 1 365 23
he 1 365 23
wants, 1 365 23
he 1 365 23
will 1 365 23
cave 1 365 23
and 1 365 23
give 1 365 23
the 1 365 23
CIA 1 365 23
the 1 365 23
continued 1 365 23
secrecy 1 365 23
it 1 365 23
so 1 365 23
desperately 1 365 23
needs. 1 365 23

All 0 365 24
this 0 365 24
will 0 365 24
happen 0 365 24
by 0 365 24
this 0 365 24
Thursday, 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
date 0 365 24
set 0 365 24
by 0 365 24
law 0 365 24
for 0 365 24
release 0 365 24
of 0 365 24
all 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
JFK 0 365 24
records 0 365 24
that 0 365 24
Trump 0 365 24
has 0 365 24
not 0 365 24
blocked. 0 365 24

Think 0 365 25
about 0 365 25
it: 0 365 25
The 0 365 25
CIA 0 365 25
has 0 365 25
asked 0 365 25
the 0 365 25
president 0 365 25
to 0 365 25
continue 0 365 25
secrecy 0 365 25
of 0 365 25
records 0 365 25
that 0 365 25
are 0 365 25
more 0 365 25
than 0 365 25
50 0 365 25
years 0 365 25
old 0 365 25
or, 0 365 25
apparently, 0 365 25
some 0 365 25
relating 0 365 25
to 0 365 25
secret 0 365 25
correspondence 0 365 25
between 0 365 25
the 0 365 25
CIA 0 365 25
and 0 365 25
the 0 365 25
Assassination 0 365 25
Records 0 365 25
Review 0 365 25
Board 0 365 25
back 0 365 25
in 0 365 25
the 0 365 25
1990s. 0 365 25

The 0 365 26
CIA’s 0 365 26
ground? 0 365 26

“National 0 365 27
security” 0 365 27
of 0 365 27
course, 0 365 27
the 1 365 27
two 1 365 27
most 1 365 27
important 1 365 27
and 1 365 27
meaningless 1 365 27
words 1 365 27
in 0 365 27
the 0 365 27
American 0 365 27
political 0 365 27
lexicon. 0 365 27

National 0 365 28
security? 0 365 28

Really? 0 365 29

Whatever 0 365 30
definition 0 365 30
that 0 365 30
one 0 365 30
might 0 365 30
put 0 365 30
on 0 365 30
that 0 365 30
nebulous 0 365 30
term, 0 365 30
no 1 365 30
reasonable 1 365 30
person 1 365 30
can 1 365 30
honestly 1 365 30
believe 1 365 30
that 0 365 30
the 0 365 30
release 0 365 30
of 0 365 30
50-year-old 0 365 30
records 0 365 30
are 0 365 30
going 0 365 30
to 0 365 30
result 1 365 30
in 1 365 30
the 1 365 30
United 1 365 30
States 1 365 30
falling 1 365 30
into 1 365 30
the 1 365 30
ocean 1 365 30
or 0 365 30
even 0 365 30
that 0 365 30
the 1 365 30
communists 1 365 30
are 1 365 30
going 1 365 30
to 1 365 30
take 1 365 30
over 1 365 30
the 1 365 30
federal 1 365 30
government. 1 365 30

The 0 365 31
CIA 0 365 31
says 0 365 31
that 0 365 31
releasing 0 365 31
its 0 365 31
decades-old 0 365 31
JFK 0 365 31
records 0 365 31
will 0 365 31
reveal 0 365 31
secret 0 365 31
“methods” 0 365 31
of 0 365 31
intelligence 0 365 31
gathering. 0 365 31

Really? 1 365 32

What, 1 365 33
like 1 365 33
the 1 365 33
CIA 1 365 33
was 1 365 33
using 1 365 33
typewriters 1 365 33
instead 1 365 33
of 1 365 33
computers 1 365 33
and 1 365 33
pay 1 365 33
telephones 1 365 33
instead 1 365 33
of 1 365 33
cell 1 365 33
phones? 1 365 33

What 0 365 34
is 0 365 34
amazing 0 365 34
(or 0 365 34
not) 0 365 34
is 0 365 34
the 1 365 34
extreme 1 365 34
nonchalance 1 365 34
of 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
mainstream 0 365 34
media 0 365 34
to 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
CIA’s 0 365 34
request 0 365 34
for 0 365 34
continued 0 365 34
secrecy. 0 365 34

That 0 365 35
should 0 365 35
be 0 365 35
big 0 365 35
news. 0 365 35

It’s 1 365 36
essentially 1 365 36
an 1 365 36
admission 1 365 36
of 1 365 36
guilt, 1 365 36
given 0 365 36
that 0 365 36
it 0 365 36
is 0 365 36
absolutely 1 365 36
ludicrous 1 365 36
to 0 365 36
think 0 365 36
that 0 365 36
“national 0 365 36
security” 0 365 36
would 0 365 36
be 0 365 36
threatened 0 365 36
by 0 365 36
the 0 365 36
release 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
the 0 365 36
CIA’s 0 365 36
long-secret 0 365 36
JFK-assassination-related 0 365 36
records. 0 365 36

You 0 365 37
see, 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
mainstream 0 365 37
media 0 365 37
starts 0 365 37
with 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
assumption 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
CIA 0 365 37
had 0 365 37
nothing 0 365 37
to 0 365 37
do 0 365 37
with 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
assassination. 0 365 37

In 0 365 38
their 0 365 38
minds, 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
assassination 0 365 38
was 0 365 38
committed 0 365 38
by 0 365 38
a 0 365 38
lone 1 365 38
nut 1 365 38
former 1 365 38
U.S. 1 365 38
Marine 1 365 38
communist, 1 365 38
one 0 365 38
who 0 365 38
had 0 365 38
no 0 365 38
motive 0 365 38
to 0 365 38
kill 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
president. 0 365 38

Such 0 365 39
being 0 365 39
the 0 365 39
case, 0 365 39
the 0 365 39
mainstream 0 365 39
media, 0 365 39
deferring 0 365 39
to 0 365 39
the 0 365 39
CIA, 0 365 39
automatically 0 365 39
concludes 0 365 39
that 0 365 39
its 0 365 39
wish 0 365 39
to 0 365 39
continue 0 365 39
keeping 0 365 39
secret 0 365 39
has 0 365 39
to 0 365 39
be 0 365 39
based 0 365 39
on 0 365 39
“national 0 365 39
security” 0 365 39
grounds 0 365 39
rather 0 365 39
than 0 365 39
an 0 365 39
attempt 0 365 39
by 0 365 39
the 0 365 39
CIA 0 365 39
to 0 365 39
continue 0 365 39
its 0 365 39
cover-up 0 365 39
of 0 365 39
its 0 365 39
assassination 0 365 39
of 0 365 39
the 0 365 39
president. 0 365 39

Let’s 0 365 40
proceed 0 365 40
from 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
opposite 0 365 40
assumption: 0 365 40
That 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
CIA, 0 365 40
in 0 365 40
partnership 0 365 40
with 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
military 0 365 40
and 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
Mafia, 0 365 40
orchestrated 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
assassination 0 365 40
by 0 365 40
framing 0 365 40
a 0 365 40
former 0 365 40
U.S. 0 365 40
Marine 0 365 40
who 0 365 40
was 0 365 40
then 0 365 40
working 0 365 40
for 0 365 40
U.S. 0 365 40
intelligence, 0 365 40
either 0 365 40
Navy 0 365 40
intelligence, 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
CIA, 0 365 40
or 0 365 40
the 0 365 40
FBI, 0 365 40
or 0 365 40
a 0 365 40
combination 0 365 40
of 0 365 40
all 0 365 40
three. 0 365 40

Don’t 0 365 41
forget, 0 365 41
after 0 365 41
all, 0 365 41
that 0 365 41
that’s 0 365 41
what 0 365 41
Oswald 0 365 41
said. 0 365 41

He 0 365 42
said 0 365 42
he 0 365 42
was 0 365 42
being 0 365 42
framed. 0 365 42

Yet, 0 365 43
from 0 365 43
the 0 365 43
very 0 365 43
beginning, 0 365 43
the 1 365 43
mainstream 1 365 43
media 1 365 43
has 1 365 43
never 1 365 43
given 1 365 43
any 1 365 43
serious 1 365 43
consideration 1 365 43
to 0 365 43
the 0 365 43
possibility 0 365 43
that 0 365 43
Oswald 0 365 43
was 0 365 43
framed 0 365 43
for 0 365 43
the 0 365 43
crime. 0 365 43

Instead, 0 365 44
they 0 365 44
have 0 365 44
steadfastly 0 365 44
stuck 0 365 44
with 0 365 44
the 0 365 44
official 0 365 44
story, 0 365 44
one 0 365 44
that 0 365 44
has 0 365 44
all 0 365 44
the 0 365 44
characteristics 0 365 44
of 0 365 44
a 0 365 44
pat 1 365 44
frame-up: 1 365 44
That 0 365 44
Oswald 0 365 44
acted 0 365 44
alone 0 365 44
or 0 365 44
possibly 0 365 44
acted 0 365 44
in 0 365 44
concert 0 365 44
with 0 365 44
others, 0 365 44
both 0 365 44
of 0 365 44
which 0 365 44
lead 0 365 44
to 0 365 44
nothing 0 365 44
but 0 365 44
dead 0 365 44
ends, 0 365 44
contradictions, 0 365 44
and 0 365 44
anomalies. 0 365 44

Now, 0 365 45
let’s 0 365 45
assume 0 365 45
instead 0 365 45
that 0 365 45
Oswald 0 365 45
was 0 365 45
telling 0 365 45
the 0 365 45
truth 0 365 45
when 0 365 45
he 0 365 45
said 0 365 45
he 0 365 45
was 0 365 45
being 0 365 45
framed. 0 365 45

In 0 365 46
that 0 365 46
case, 0 365 46
it 0 365 46
would 0 365 46
be 0 365 46
imperative 0 365 46
that 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
CIA 0 365 46
and 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
military 0 365 46
keep 0 365 46
as 0 365 46
tight 0 365 46
a 0 365 46
lid 0 365 46
on 0 365 46
their 0 365 46
records 0 365 46
as 0 365 46
possible 0 365 46
to 0 365 46
ensure 0 365 46
that 0 365 46
investigators 0 365 46
or 0 365 46
investigative 0 365 46
reporters 0 365 46
would 0 365 46
have 0 365 46
a 0 365 46
difficult 0 365 46
time 0 365 46
piercing 0 365 46
through 0 365 46
to 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
circumstantial 0 365 46
evidence 0 365 46
that 0 365 46
establishes 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
frame-up. 0 365 46

As 0 365 47
part 0 365 47
of 0 365 47
the 0 365 47
frame-up, 0 365 47
the 0 365 47
CIA 0 365 47
would 0 365 47
have 0 365 47
to 0 365 47
fortify 0 365 47
the 0 365 47
persona 0 365 47
of 0 365 47
Oswald, 0 365 47
its 0 365 47
intelligence 0 365 47
agent, 0 365 47
as 0 365 47
a 0 365 47
purported 1 365 47
communist. 1 365 47

That 1 365 48
would 1 365 48
enable 1 365 48
the 1 365 48
CIA 1 365 48
to 1 365 48
blame 1 365 48
the 1 365 48
assassination 1 365 48
on 1 365 48
a 1 365 48
communist, 1 365 48
which, 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
coincidentally, 0 365 48
was 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
advice 0 365 48
that 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
Pentagon 0 365 48
and 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
CIA 0 365 48
were 0 365 48
doling 0 365 48
out 0 365 48
to 0 365 48
Latin 0 365 48
American 0 365 48
military 0 365 48
dictatorships 0 365 48
at 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
School 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
Americas. 0 365 48

In 0 365 49
cases 0 365 49
of 0 365 49
covert 0 365 49
state-sponsored 0 365 49
assassinations, 0 365 49
Latin 0 365 49
American 0 365 49
regimes 0 365 49
were 0 365 49
taught, 0 365 49
a 1 365 49
good 1 365 49
strategy 1 365 49
was 1 365 49
to 1 365 49
blame 1 365 49
the 1 365 49
assassination 1 365 49
on 1 365 49
a 1 365 49
communist 1 365 49
because 1 365 49
then 1 365 49
they 1 365 49
could 1 365 49
smear 1 365 49
anyone 1 365 49
who 1 365 49
challenged 1 365 49
the 1 365 49
official 1 365 49
story 1 365 49
as 1 365 49
a 1 365 49
communist 1 365 49
sympathizer. 1 365 49

It 0 365 50
would 0 365 50
also 0 365 50
explain 0 365 50
why 0 365 50
the 0 365 50
CIA 0 365 50
was 0 365 50
closely 0 365 50
monitoring 0 365 50
Oswald’s 0 365 50
movements 0 365 50
prior 0 365 50
to 0 365 50
the 0 365 50
assassination, 0 365 50
something 0 365 50
else 0 365 50
that 0 365 50
the 0 365 50
CIA 0 365 50
kept 0 365 50
secret 0 365 50
for 0 365 50
decades. 0 365 50

They 1 365 51
had 1 365 51
to 1 365 51
make 1 365 51
certain 1 365 51
that 1 365 51
Oswald 1 365 51
was 1 365 51
not 1 365 51
on 1 365 51
to 1 365 51
them 1 365 51
and 1 365 51
had 1 365 51
not 1 365 51
discovered 1 365 51
that 1 365 51
he 1 365 51
was 1 365 51
being 1 365 51
set 1 365 51
up 1 365 51
for 1 365 51
a 1 365 51
frame-up. 1 365 51

The 0 365 52
first 0 365 52
organization 0 365 52
that 0 365 52
came 0 365 52
out 0 365 52
with 0 365 52
a 0 365 52
press 0 365 52
release 0 365 52
advertising 0 365 52
Oswald’s 0 365 52
bona 0 365 52
fides 0 365 52
was 0 365 52
the 0 365 52
DRE, 0 365 52
an 0 365 52
anti-communist 0 365 52
group 0 365 52
in 0 365 52
New 0 365 52
Orleans 0 365 52
with 0 365 52
which 0 365 52
Oswald 0 365 52
had 0 365 52
had 0 365 52
contact. 0 365 52

What 0 365 53
no 0 365 53
one 0 365 53
knew 0 365 53
at 0 365 53
the 0 365 53
time, 0 365 53
and 0 365 53
what 0 365 53
the 0 365 53
CIA 0 365 53
intentionally 0 365 53
kept 0 365 53
secret 0 365 53
for 0 365 53
decades, 0 365 53
was 0 365 53
that 0 365 53
the 0 365 53
DRE 0 365 53
was 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
CIA 0 365 53
front 0 365 53
organization. 0 365 53

It 0 365 54
was 0 365 54
being 0 365 54
generously 0 365 54
funded 0 365 54
by 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
CIA 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
controlled 0 365 54
by 0 365 54
a 0 365 54
secret 0 365 54
CIA 0 365 54
agent 0 365 54
named 0 365 54
George 0 365 54
Joannides, 0 365 54
which 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
CIA 0 365 54
would 0 365 54
intentionally 0 365 54
keep 0 365 54
secret 0 365 54
from 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
Warren 0 365 54
Commission 0 365 54
in 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
1960s, 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
House 0 365 54
Select 0 365 54
Committee 0 365 54
in 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
1970s, 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
Assassination 0 365 54
Records 0 365 54
Review 0 365 54
Board 0 365 54
in 0 365 54
the 0 365 54
1990s. 0 365 54

But 0 365 55
there 0 365 55
was 0 365 55
another 0 365 55
big 0 365 55
operation 0 365 55
to 0 365 55
establish 0 365 55
Oswald’s 0 365 55
communist 0 365 55
bona 0 365 55
fides 0 365 55
before 0 365 55
the 0 365 55
assassination. 0 365 55

It 0 365 56
had 0 365 56
to 0 365 56
do 0 365 56
with 0 365 56
Oswald’s 0 365 56
trip 0 365 56
to 0 365 56
Mexico 0 365 56
City, 0 365 56
where 0 365 56
he 0 365 56
visited 0 365 56
the 0 365 56
Cuban 0 365 56
and 0 365 56
Soviet 0 365 56
embassies. 0 365 56

Something 1 365 57
dreadful 1 365 57
obviously 0 365 57
went 0 365 57
wrong 0 365 57
with 0 365 57
that 0 365 57
part 0 365 57
of 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
operation 0 365 57
because 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
official 0 365 57
investigation 0 365 57
into 0 365 57
it 0 365 57
was 0 365 57
quickly 0 365 57
shut 0 365 57
down 0 365 57
during 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
early 0 365 57
post-assassination 0 365 57
period. 0 365 57

Today, 0 365 58
Oswald’s 0 365 58
Mexico 0 365 58
City 0 365 58
trip, 0 365 58
which 0 365 58
is 0 365 58
part 0 365 58
of 0 365 58
those 0 365 58
CIA 0 365 58
records 0 365 58
ready 0 365 58
to 0 365 58
be 0 365 58
released, 0 365 58
is 0 365 58
still 0 365 58
shrouded 0 365 58
in 0 365 58
mystery. 0 365 58

The 0 365 59
CIA’s 0 365 59
continued 0 365 59
secrecy 0 365 59
in 0 365 59
the 0 365 59
JFK 0 365 59
assassination 0 365 59
is 0 365 59
no 0 365 59
big 0 365 59
surprise. 0 365 59

As 0 365 60
I 0 365 60
wrote 0 365 60
in 0 365 60
my 0 365 60
October 0 365 60
11 0 365 60
article, 0 365 60
“Will 0 365 60
Trump 0 365 60
Make 0 365 60
a 0 365 60
Deal 0 365 60
with 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
CIA 0 365 60
on 0 365 60
JFK 0 365 60
Records?,” 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
CIA 0 365 60
is 0 365 60
between 0 365 60
a 0 365 60
rock 0 365 60
and 0 365 60
a 0 365 60
hard 0 365 60
place. 0 365 60

On 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
one 0 365 61
hand, 0 365 61
it 1 365 61
knows 1 365 61
that 1 365 61
those 1 365 61
records 1 365 61
will 1 365 61
further 1 365 61
implicate 1 365 61
the 1 365 61
CIA 1 365 61
in 1 365 61
the 1 365 61
Kennedy 1 365 61
assassination. 1 365 61

On 0 365 62
the 0 365 62
other 0 365 62
hand, 0 365 62
it 0 365 62
knows 0 365 62
that 0 365 62
by 1 365 62
seeking 1 365 62
continued 1 365 62
secrecy, 1 365 62
it’s 1 365 62
essentially 1 365 62
an 1 365 62
implicit 1 365 62
acknowledgment 1 365 62
of 1 365 62
guilt. 1 365 62

Not 0 365 63
surprisingly, 0 365 63
it 0 365 63
is 0 365 63
choosing 0 365 63
the 0 365 63
latter 0 365 63
course, 0 365 63
especially 0 365 63
because 1 365 63
it 1 365 63
knows 1 365 63
that 1 365 63
its 1 365 63
assets 1 365 63
and 1 365 63
allies 1 365 63
in 1 365 63
the 1 365 63
mainstream 1 365 63
press 1 365 63
will 1 365 63
continue 1 365 63
to 1 365 63
come 1 365 63
to 1 365 63
its 1 365 63
defense 1 365 63
with 0 365 63
respect 0 365 63
to 0 365 63
its 0 365 63
ridiculous 0 365 63
claim 0 365 63
of 0 365 63
“national 0 365 63
security.” 0 365 63

Do 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
CIA’s 0 365 64
long-secret 0 365 64
records 0 365 64
contain 0 365 64
a 0 365 64
video-taped 0 365 64
confession? 0 365 64

Of 0 365 65
course 0 365 65
not. 0 365 65

And 0 365 66
they 0 365 66
don’t 0 365 66
contain 0 365 66
any 0 365 66
reference 0 365 66
to 0 365 66
assassinating 0 365 66
Kennedy. 0 365 66

The 0 365 67
CIA’s 0 365 67
practice 0 365 67
from 0 365 67
the 0 365 67
very 0 365 67
beginning 0 365 67
has 0 365 67
been 0 365 67
to 0 365 67
not 0 365 67
put 0 365 67

to 0 365 67
a 0 365 67
state-sponsored 0 365 67
assassination 0 365 67
into 0 365 67
writing. 0 365 67

But 0 365 68
there 0 365 68
has 0 365 68
to 0 365 68
be 0 365 68
a 0 365 68
reason 0 365 68
why 0 365 68
the 0 365 68
CIA 0 365 68
chose 0 365 68
to 0 365 68
keep 0 365 68
this 0 365 68
particular 0 365 68
batch 0 365 68
of 0 365 68
records 0 365 68
secret 0 365 68
for 0 365 68
more 0 365 68
than 0 365 68
50 0 365 68
years. 0 365 68

Those 0 365 69
long-secret 0 365 69
records 0 365 69
undoubtedly 0 365 69
include 0 365 69
small 0 365 69
bits 0 365 69
of 0 365 69
important 0 365 69
circumstantial 0 365 69
evidence 0 365 69
that 0 365 69
fill 0 365 69
out 0 365 69
even 0 365 69
further 0 365 69
the 0 365 69
mosaic 0 365 69
of 0 365 69
a 0 365 69
regime-change 0 365 69
operation 0 365 69
that 0 365 69
took 0 365 69
place 0 365 69
in 0 365 69
Dallas 0 365 69
in 0 365 69
November 0 365 69
1963, 0 365 69
the 0 365 69
same 0 365 69
types 0 365 69
of 0 365 69
regime-change 0 365 69
operation 0 365 69
that 0 365 69
took 0 365 69
place 0 365 69
in 0 365 69
Iran 0 365 69

1961, 0 365 69
and 0 365 69
Chile 0 365 69
in 0 365 69
1973, 0 365 69
all 0 365 69
of 0 365 69
which 0 365 69
the 1 365 69
CIA 1 365 69
steadfastly 1 365 69
kept 1 365 69
secret 1 365 69
from 1 365 69
the 1 365 69
American 1 365 69
people. 1 365 69

In 0 365 70
1953, 0 365 70
the 0 365 70
CIA 0 365 70
was 0 365 70
in 0 365 70
the 0 365 70
process 0 365 70
of 0 365 70
developing 0 365 70
a 0 365 70
top-secret 0 365 70
manual 0 365 70
on 0 365 70
assassinations, 0 365 70
one 0 365 70
that 0 365 70
showed 0 365 70
that 0 365 70
the 0 365 70
CIA 0 365 70
was 0 365 70
specializing 0 365 70
not 0 365 70
only 0 365 70
in 0 365 70
the 0 365 70
art 0 365 70
of 0 365 70
assassination 0 365 70
but 0 365 70
also 0 365 70
in 0 365 70
the 0 365 70
art 0 365 70
of 0 365 70
covering 0 365 70
up 0 365 70
its 0 365 70
role 0 365 70
in 0 365 70
state-sponsored 0 365 70
assassinations. 0 365 70

Every 1 365 71
American 1 365 71
owes 1 365 71
it 1 365 71
to 1 365 71
himself 1 365 71
to 1 365 71
read 1 365 71
that 1 365 71
manual. 1 365 71

Too 0 365 72
bad 0 365 72
the 0 365 72
mainstream 0 365 72
press 0 365 72
has 0 365 72
never 0 365 72
given 0 365 72
that 0 365 72
manual 0 365 72
the 0 365 72
consideration 0 365 72
it 0 365 72
deserves. 0 365 72

If 0 365 73
it 0 365 73
did, 0 365 73
it 0 365 73
might 0 365 73
not 0 365 73
be 0 365 73
so 0 365 73
deferential 0 365 73
to 0 365 73
the 0 365 73
deal 0 365 73
that 0 365 73
