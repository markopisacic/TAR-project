Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
helped 0
get 0
the 0
ball 0
rolling 0
by 0
praising 0
Farrakhan. 0

Democratic 0
Illinois 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
defended 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan 0
as 0
an 0
“outstanding 1
human 1
being” 1
on 0
Monday. 0

Farrakhan’s 0
history 0
of 0
racially 0
extreme 0
comments 0
includes 0
blaming 0
Jews 0
for 0
the 0
September 0
11 0
attacks, 0
saying 0
white 0
people 0
“deserve 1
to 1
die” 1
and 0
praising 0
Adolf 0
Hitler 0
as 0
a 0
“very 1
great 1
man.” 1
“I 0
personally 1
know 1
[Farrakhan], 1
I’ve 1
been 1
to 1
his 1
home, 1
done 1
meetings, 1
participated 1
in 1
events 1
with 1
him,” 1
Davis 1
told 1
TheDC. 1

“I 1
don’t 1
regard 1
Louis 1
Farrakhan 1
as 1
an 1
aberration 1
or 1
anything, 1
I 1
regard 1
him 1
as 1
an 1
outstanding 1
human 1
being 1
who 1
commands 1
a 1
following 1
of 1
individuals 1
who 1
are 1
learned 1
and 1
articulate 1
and 1
he 1
plays 1
a 1
big 1
role 1
in 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
of 1
people,” 1
he 1
emphasized 1
later. 1

Then 0
Rep. 0
Davis' 0
office 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
disavowing 0
Farrakhan. 0

And 0
then 0
Davis 0
got 0
right 0
back 0
to 0
talking 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
and 0
disavowed 0
the 0
disavowal. 0

“The 0
congressman 0
was 0
insistent 0
that 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
misquoted 0
him 0
during 0
the 0
interview 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
subscribe 0
to 0
Farrakhan’s 0
anti-Semitic 0
statements 0
and 0
actions 0
in 0
the 0
past,” 0
the 0
ADL 0
official 0
told 0
JTA 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“He 0
expressed 0
an 0
interest 0
in 0
seeing 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
latest 0
statements 0
made 0
by 0
Farrakhan 0
vis-a-vis 0
Jews, 0
which 0
we 0
promptly 0
shared 0
with 0
him.” 0
The 0
congressman 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
why 0
the 0
ADL 0
wrote 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misquoted 0
in 0
his 0
praise 0
for 0
the 0
anti-Semite, 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
if 0
someone 0
from 0
his 0
office 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
ADL 0
he 0
was 0
misquoted, 0
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
News 0
Foundation 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

“I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
to 0
write. 0

Nah, 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
Farrakhan, 0
I 0
don’t 0
spend 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
my 0
time 0
dealing 0
with 0
those 0
kind 0
of 0
things,” 0
Davis 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
just 0
one 0
segment 0
of 0
what 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
our 0
world. 0

The 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
Farrakhan 1
and 1
the 1
Jewish 1
question 1
and 1
his 1
position 1
on 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
forth. 1

For 0
those 0
heavy 0
into 0
it, 0
that’s 0
their 0
thing, 0
but 0
it 0
ain’t 0
my 0
thing,” 0
he 0
said 0

The 0
term 0
"Jewish 0
Question" 0
is 0
largely 0
used 0
by 0
anti-Semites. 0

So 0
Davis 0
then 0
sorta 0
disavowed 0
his 0
own 0
statements. 0

J 0
Street 0
endorsed 0
him. 0

And 0
then 0
he 0
talked 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
again. 0

Democratic 0
Illinois 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
thinks 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan, 0
a 1
notorious 1
racist 1
and 1
anti-Semite, 1
does 0
“outstanding 1
work” 1
but 0
doesn’t 0
agree 0
with 0
Farrakhan’s 0
positions 0
that 0
white 1
people 1
are 1
“devils” 1
and 1
Jewish 1
people 1
are 1
satanic. 1

Progress! 0

"I 1
don’t 1
spend 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
time, 1
I 1
buy 1
Final 1
Call 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
them. 1

I’ve 1
been 1
to 1
Saviour’s 1
Day, 1
I’ve 1
read, 1
I’ve 1
been 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
Elijah 1
Muhammad, 1
so 1
those 1
are 1
my 1
positions, 1
but 1
I 1
do 1
disagree 1
with 1
the 1
notion 1
that 1
white 1
people 1
are 1
devils.” 1

I 1
wonder 1
how 1
far 1
a 1
white 1
congressman 1
would 1
get 1
saying, 1
"I 1
attended 1
the 1
Klavern, 1
but 1
I 1
don't 1
agree 1
with 1
the 1
KKK's 1
views 1
about 1
black 1
people." 1

But 0
that's 0
Rep. 0
Davis' 0
current 0
views. 0

He 0
likes 0
a 0
racist 0
hate 0
group. 0

But 0
doesn't 0
believe 0
white 0
people 0
are 0
devils 1
or 0
Jews 0
are 0
satanic. 1

Whoever 0
the 0
JTA 0
has 0
on 0
the 0
"explain 0
away 0
Farrakhan's 0
Dem 0
fandom" 0
beat 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
busy 0
again. 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
typical 0
of 0
the 0
Dems 0
and 0
their 0
useful 1
idiots. 1

And 0
J 0
Street 0
is 0
on 0
record 0
as 0
endorsing 0
a 1
politician 1
who 1
praised 1
a 1
racist 1
hate 1
group 1
leader 1
and 1
discussed 1
the 1
"Jewish 1
question." 1
