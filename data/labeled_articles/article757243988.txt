seventh 0

social 0

issued 0
to 0

The 0
packet, 0
edited 0
from 0
the 0
full 0
version 0
of 0
a 0
world 0
religions 0
workbook, 0
instructed 0
students 0
to 0
practice 0
writing 0
the 0
Shahada, 0
or 0
Islamic 0
profession 0
of 0
faith, 0
in 0
Arabic 0

— 0
an 0
assignment 0
that, 0
if 0
left 0
undone, 0
would 0
result 0
in 0
detention, 0
according 0
to 0
Penkoski’s 0
daughter. 0

The 0
Shahada 0
states: 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
god 0
but 0
Allah, 0
and 0
Muhammad 0
is 0
the 0
messenger 0
of 0
Allah.” 0
Penkoski 0
called 0
Mountain 0
Ridge 0
Middle 0
School 0
Principal 0
Ron 0
Branch 0
and 0
objected 0
to 0
the 0
packet, 0
saying 0
it 0
disturbed 1
him 0
and 0
had 0
misinformation 0
about 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
calligraphy. 0

“I 0
saw 0
the 0
assignment 0
of 0
writing 0
the 0
Shahada 0
in 0
Arabic. 0

Their 0
excuse 0
was 0
calligraphy,” 0
Penkoski 0
told 0
The 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

“I 0
was 0
like, 0
‘Whoa! 0

Whoa! 0

Whoa!’ 0
First 0
of 0
all, 0
calligraphy 0
was 0
invented 0
in 0
China 0
3,000 0
years 0
prior 0
to 0
Muhammad. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
my 0
daughter 0
to 0
write 0
that 0
disturbed 1
me.” 0
“I 0
said, 0
‘That 0
is 0
not 0
happening. 0

My 0
daughter 0
is 0
not 0
doing 0
that.’ 0
My 0
daughter 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
if 0
she 0
didn’t 0
do 0
the 0
assignment, 0
then 0
she 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
[detention] 0
slip,” 0
Penkoski 0
added…. 0

There 0
were 0
two 0
different 0
calligraphy 0
assignments 0
— 0
one 0
involving 0
the 0
Shahada 0
and 0
another 0
instructing 0
students 0
to 0
practice 0
writing 0
English 0
letters 0
in 0
calligraphy, 0
Branch 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

Hinson 0
“told 0
the 0
students 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
do 0
these 0
activities 0
if 0
they 0
wanted,” 0
Branch 0
claimed. 0

“The 0
teacher 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
several 0
times 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
study 0
of 0
world 0
religions 0
and 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
trying 0
to 0
advocate 0
for 0
any 0
religion 0
over 0
another. 0

She 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
had 0
questions 0
about 0
religious 0
beliefs, 0
that 0
those 0
conversations 0
should 0
take 0
place 0
with 0
their 0
parents,” 0
Branch 0
added. 0

Penkoski 0
claimed 0
the 0
teacher 0
sent 0
students 0
home 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
packet 0
the 0
day 0
after 0
he 0
lodged 0
a 0
complaint 0
— 0
this 0
time, 0
with 0
certain 0
sections 0
crossed 0
out 0
but 0
still 0
including 0
the 0
Shahada 0
assignment. 0

Penkoksi 0
called 0
the 0
principal 0
again 0
and 0
confronted 0
Hinson 0
over 0
the 0
phone. 0

“I 0
said, 0
‘This 0
is 0
not 0
OK 0
in 0
asking 0
my 0
kid 0
to 0
write 0
down 0
the 0
Shahada.’ 0
The 0
teacher 0
happened 0
to 0
walk-in 0
and 0
said 0
she 0
made 0
it 0
an 0
option 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
kids 0
didn’t 0
have 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

My 0
daughter 0
conflicted 0
that 0
story 0
and 0
said, 0
‘No, 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
was 0
said.’ 0
What 0
was 0
said 0
was, 0
‘Do 0
the 0
assignment; 0
and 0
if 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
learn 0
more 0
about 0
the 0
Quran, 0
ask 0
your 0
parents,’” 0
Penkoski 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

Each 0
religion 0
studied 0
in 0
the 0
class, 0
including 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism, 0
received 0
“equitable 0
treatment,” 0
Branch 0
also 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

He 0
said 0
the 0
class 0
spent 0
a 0
week 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
on 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
— 0
other 0
religions 0
took 0
one 0
week 0
— 0
and 0
discussed 0
each 0
religion’s 0
beliefs, 0
history 0
and 0
practices. 0

During 0
the 0
section 0
on 0
Christianity, 0
“Jesus 0
was 0
taught,” 0
Branch 0
claimed. 0

“The 0
students 0
read 0
the 0
chapter 0
in 0
our 0
textbook 0
that 0
discusses 0
Christianity’s 0
belief 0
that 0
Jesus 0
is 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
God, 0
and 0
salvation. 0

They 0
also 0
discussed 0
the 0
Sermon 0
on 0
the 0
Mount, 0
the 0
Last 0
Supper 0
and 0
Jesus’ 0
Betrayal, 0
the 0
Trinity, 0
and 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer, 0
among 0
other 0
topics,” 0
Branch 0
said. 0

Penkoski 0
and 0
his 0
daughter, 0
Brielle, 0
contested 0
Branch’s 0
claims. 0

The 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer 0
was 0
not 0
taught, 0
and 0
very 0
little 0
time 0
was 0
spent 0
teaching 0
about 0
Jesus, 0
they 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

“We 0
did 0
[the 0
unit 0
on 0
Christianity] 0
over 0
a 0
week 0
and 0
two 0
days. 0

We 0
watched 0
two 0
different 0
videos. 0

We 0
didn’t 0
finish 0
them. 0

They 0
taught 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
about 0
Moses 0
and 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments, 0
Peter 0
and 0
Paul,” 0
Brielle 0
explained. 0

“We 0
learned 0
about 0
the 0
Israelites 0
and 0
how 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
persecuted 0
by 0
the 0
Romans. 0

We 0
were 0
told 0
about 0
the 0
Jews 0
and 0
told 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
about 0
Jesus.” 0
Penkoski 0
also 0
shared 0
with 0
Christian 0
Post 0
the 0
packets 0
on 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
passed 0
out 0
in 0
class 0
and 0
allegedly 0
modified 0
from 0
the 0
original 0
full 0
version. 0

While 0
the 0
packet 0
on 0
Islam 0
contained 0
verses 0
from 0
the 0
Koran, 0
the 0
packets 0
for 0
those 0
religions 0
did 0
not 0
contain 0
scripture 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
encourage 0
students 0
to 0
write 0
prayers 0
or 0
faith 0
statements, 0
he 0
said. 0

“Notice 0
no 0
Bible 0
verses, 0
no 0
reciting 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments 0
or 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“[There’s] 0
no 0
practicing 0
writing 0
in 0
Hebrew 0
as 0
compared 0
to 0
the 0
Islamic 0
