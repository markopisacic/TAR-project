The 0 329 1
Dallas 0 329 1
Police 0 329 1
on 0 329 1
Thursday 0 329 1
announced 0 329 1
the 0 329 1
findings 0 329 1
of 0 329 1
a 0 329 1
search 0 329 1
warrant 0 329 1
they 0 329 1
executed 0 329 1
on 0 329 1
the 0 329 1
home 0 329 1
of 0 329 1
Botham 0 329 1
Jean 0 329 1
after 0 329 1
he 0 329 1
was 0 329 1
gunned 0 329 1
down 0 329 1
in 0 329 1

by 0 329 1
one 0 329 1

The 0 329 2
department 0 329 2
is 0 329 2
now 0 329 2
accused 0 329 2
of 0 329 2
trying 0 329 2
to 0 329 2
“smear” 1 329 2
Jean 0 329 2
by 0 329 2
claiming 0 329 2
they 0 329 2
found 0 329 2
a 0 329 2
tiny 1 329 2
bit 1 329 2
of 0 329 2
marijuana 0 329 2
in 0 329 2
his 0 329 2
house—as 0 329 2
if 0 329 2
this 0 329 2
justifies 0 329 2
going 0 329 2
into 0 329 2
someone’s 0 329 2
home 0 329 2
and 0 329 2
murdering 0 329 2
them. 0 329 2

The 0 329 3
timing 0 329 3
couldn’t 0 329 3
have 0 329 3
been 0 329 3
more 0 329 3
insidiously 0 329 3
planned 0 329 3
as 0 329 3
police 0 329 3
released 0 329 3
the 0 329 3
affidavit 0 329 3
on 0 329 3
the 0 329 3
day 0 329 3
of 0 329 3
Jean’s 0 329 3
funeral—despite 0 329 3
having 0 329 3
allegedly 0 329 3
found 0 329 3
the 0 329 3
marijuana 0 329 3
last 0 329 3
week. 0 329 3

According 0 329 4
to 0 329 4
the 0 329 4
affidavit, 0 329 4
when 0 329 4
they 0 329 4
searched 0 329 4
his 0 329 4
home, 0 329 4
police 0 329 4
claimed 0 329 4
to 0 329 4
have 0 329 4
found 0 329 4
10.4 0 329 4
grams 0 329 4
of 0 329 4
pot—less 0 329 4
than 0 329 4
half 0 329 4
an 0 329 4
ounce. 0 329 4

Police 0 329 5
also 0 329 5
said 0 329 5
they 0 329 5
found 0 329 5
two 0 329 5

and 0 329 5
a 0 329 5
metal 0 329 5
marijuana 0 329 5
grinder—the 0 329 5
horror. 1 329 5

Even 1 329 6
if 1 329 6
police 1 329 6
did 1 329 6
find 1 329 6
marijuana, 1 329 6
why 1 329 6
on 1 329 6

be 0 329 22
correct 0 329 22
in 0 329 22
his 0 329 22

It 0 329 23
is 0 329 23
standard 0 329 23

Even 0 329 24
sadder, 0 329 24
however, 0 329 24
is 0 329 24
the 0 329 24

what 0 329 34
“verbal 0 329 34
commands” 0 329 34
she 0 329 34
gave. 0 329 34

What’s 0 329 35
more, 0 329 35
any 0 329 35
verbal 0 329 35
commands 0 329 35
she 0 329 35
did 0 329 35
give 0 329 35
were 0 329 35
entirely 0 329 35
irrelevant 0 329 35
as 0 329 35
she 0 329 35
was 0 329 35
the 0 329 35
intruder—not 0 329 35
Jean. 0 329 35

Attempting 0 329 36
to 0 329 36
imply 0 329 36
that 0 329 36
Jean 0 329 36
was 0 329 36
somehow 0 329 36
at 0 329 36
fault 0 329 36
for 0 329 36
his 0 329 36
own 0 329 36
death 0 329 36
for 0 329 36
disobeying 0 329 36
the 0 329 36
commands 0 329 36
of 0 329 36
a 0 329 36
homicidal 1 329 36
cop 1 329 36
who’d 0 329 36
just 0 329 36
illegally 0 329 36
broken 0 329 36
into 0 329 36
his 0 329 36
home 0 329 36
is 0 329 36
as 0 329 36
irresponsible 0 329 36
as 0 329 36
it 0 329 36
is 0 329 36
reprehensible. 0 329 36

What’s 0 329 37
more, 0 329 37
according 0 329 37
to 0 329 37
the 0 329 37
attorneys 0 329 37
for 0 329 37
Jean, 0 329 37
when 0 329 37
Guyger 0 329 37
was 0 329 37
on 0 329 37
the 0 329 37
phone 0 329 37
with 0 329 37
police, 0 329 37
she 0 329 37
had 0 329 37
to 0 329 37
go 0 329 37
outside 0 329 37
to 0 329 37
verify 0 329 37
the 0 329 37
address 0 329 37
of 0 329 37
the 0 329 37
apartment—implying 0 329 37
that 0 329 37
she 0 329 37
knew 0 329 37
she 0 329 37
was 0 329 37
in 0 329 37
the 0 329 37
wrong 0 329 37
apartment 0 329 37
from 0 329 37
the 0 329 37
start. 0 329 37

“From 0 329 38
the 0 329 38
fact 0 329 38
that 0 329 38
when 0 329 38
you 0 329 38
look 0 329 38
at 0 329 38
an 0 329 38
affidavit 0 329 38
and 0 329 38
I’m 0 329 38
thinking 0 329 38
that 0 329 38
I’m 0 329 38
at 0 329 38
my 0 329 38
house 0 329 38
and 0 329 38
I 0 329 38
call 0 329 38
911 0 329 38
because 0 329 38
someone 0 329 38
was 0 329 38
just 0 329 38
shot,” 0 329 38
Attorney 0 329 38

said. 0 329 38

“Well, 0 329 39
the 0 329 39
very 0 329 39
first 0 329 39
thing 0 329 39
that 0 329 39
I’m 0 329 39
going 0 329 39
to 0 329 39
do 0 329 39
is 0 329 39
I’m 0 329 39
not 0 329 39
going 0 329 39
to 0 329 39
go 0 329 39
outside 0 329 39
and 0 329 39
look 0 329 39
at 0 329 39
my 0 329 39
address? 0 329 39

I’m 0 329 40
going 0 329 40
to 0 329 40
give 0 329 40
them 0 329 40
my 0 329 40

right 0 329 40
there 0 329 40

I’m 0 329 41
going 0 329 41
to 0 329 41
say 0 329 41
I’m 0 329 41
on 0 329 41
the 0 329 41
phone. 0 329 41

My 0 329 42
address 0 329 42
is 0 329 42
this. 0 329 42

Why 0 329 43
did 0 329 43
she 0 329 43
have 0 329 43
to 0 329 43
go 0 329 43
outside 0 329 43
to 0 329 43
verify 0 329 43
the 0 329 43
address? 0 329 43

It 0 329 44
makes 0 329 44
no 0 329 44
sense 0 329 44
whatsoever.” 0 329 44

Even 0 329 45
more 0 329 45
ominous 1 329 45
than 0 329 45
having 0 329 45
to 0 329 45
verify 0 329 45
the 0 329 45
address 0 329 45
is 0 329 45
the 0 329 45
fact 0 329 45
that 0 329 45
according 0 329 45
to 0 329 45
witnesses, 0 329 45
Guyger’s 0 329 45
story 0 329 45
of 0 329 45
inserting 0 329 45
the 0 329 45
key 0 329 45
into 0 329 45
Jean’s 0 329 45
door 0 329 45
and 0 329 45
it 0 329 45
opening 0 329 45
up 0 329 45
was 0 329 45
simply 0 329 45
not 0 329 45
true. 0 329 45

According 0 329 46
to 0 329 46
witnesses, 0 329 46
Guyger 0 329 46
was 0 329 46
banging 0 329 46
on 0 329 46
Jean’s 0 329 46
door, 0 329 46
demanding 0 329 46
he 0 329 46
let 0 329 46
her 0 329 46
in. 0 329 46

“Independent 0 329 47

pounding 0 329 47
on 0 329 47
the 0 329 47
door 0 329 47
and 0 329 47
demanding 0 329 47
to 0 329 47
be 0 329 47
let 0 329 47
in,” 0 329 47
Lee 0 329 47
Merritt, 0 329 47
one 0 329 47
of 0 329 47
the 0 329 47
attorneys 0 329 47
representing 0 329 47
the 0 329 47
Jean 0 329 47
family, 0 329 47
told 0 329 47
ABC 0 329 47
News. 0 329 47

“The 0 329 48
contradictions 0 329 48
begin 0 329 48
to 0 329 48

from 0 329 48
there.” 0 329 48

The 0 329 49
doors 0 329 49
in 0 329 49
the 0 329 49
complex 0 329 49
are 0 329 49

equipped 0 329 49
with 0 329 49
an 0 329 49
automatic 0 329 49
closing 0 329 49
mechanism. 0 329 49

This 0 329 50
was 0 329 50
demonstrated 0 329 50
by 0 329 50
the 0 329 50
attorneys 0 329 50
who 0 329 50
opened 0 329 50
the 0 329 50
door 0 329 50
and 0 329 50
released 0 329 50
it 0 329 50
several 0 329 50
times—showing 0 329 50
that 0 329 50
it 0 329 50
closed 0 329 50
every 0 329 50
single 0 329 50
time—blowing 0 329 50
the 0 329 50
claim 0 329 50
that 0 329 50
the 0 329 50
door 0 329 50
was 0 329 50
somehow 0 329 50
ajar 0 329 50
completely 0 329 50
out 0 329 50
of 0 329 50
the 0 329 50
water. 0 329 50

Jean’s 0 329 51
family 0 329 51
also 0 329 51
pointed 0 329 51
out 0 329 51
that 0 329 51
it 0 329 51
would 0 329 51
have 0 329 51
been 0 329 51
incredibly 0 329 51
unlikely 0 329 51
for 0 329 51
Guyger 0 329 51
to 0 329 51
mistake 0 329 51
Jean’s 0 329 51
apartment 0 329 51
for 0 329 51
her 0 329 51

distinct 0 329 51
red 0 329 51
door 0 329 51
mat 0 329 51
which 0 329 51
would 0 329 51
have 0 329 51
been 0 329 51
enough 0 329 51
for 0 329 51
the 0 329 51
cop 0 329 51
to 0 329 51
know 0 329 51
she 0 329 51
was 0 329 51
at 0 329 51
the 0 329 51
wrong 0 329 51
place. 0 329 51

Even 0 329 54
as 0 329 54
cops 0 329 54
come 0 329 54
to 0 329 54
Guyger’s 0 329 54
defense 0 329 54

attempt 0 329 54
to 0 329 54
shame, 0 329 54
smear, 1 329 54
and 0 329 54
discredit 0 329 54
her 0 329 54
victim—who 0 329 54
was 0 329 54
an 0 329 54
upstanding 1 329 54
member 1 329 54
of 1 329 54
society 1 329 54
regardless 0 329 54
of 0 329 54

plant 0 329 54
they 0 329 54
claim 0 329 54
to 0 329 54
have 0 329 54
found—they 0 329 54
are 0 329 54
failing 0 329 54
miserably. 1 329 54

Despite 0 329 55
cops 0 329 55
rallying 0 329 55
behind 0 329 55
the 0 329 55
blue 0 329 55

the 0 329 55

of 0 329 55
the 0 329 55
country 0 329 55

it. 0 329 55

In 0 329 56

writer 0 329 56

of 0 329 56
the 0 329 56

quite 0 329 56
succinctly. 0 329 56

In 0 329 57

to 0 329 57
cops 0 329 57
claiming 0 329 57

of 0 329 57
