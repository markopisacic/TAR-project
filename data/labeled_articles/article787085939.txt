The 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
on 0
Thursday 0
announced 0
the 0
findings 0
of 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
they 0
executed 0
on 0
the 0
home 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
gunned 0
down 0
in 0
his 0
apartment 0
by 0
one 0
of 0
their 0
own. 0

The 0
department 0
is 0
now 0
accused 0
of 0
trying 0
to 0
“smear” 1
Jean 0
by 0
claiming 0
they 0
found 0
a 0
tiny 1
bit 1
of 0
marijuana 0
in 0
his 0
house—as 0
if 0
this 0
justifies 0
going 0
into 0
someone’s 0
home 0
and 0
murdering 0
them. 0

The 0
timing 0
couldn’t 0
have 0
been 0
more 0
insidiously 0
planned 0
as 0
police 0
released 0
the 0
affidavit 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
funeral—despite 0
having 0
allegedly 0
found 0
the 0
marijuana 0
last 0
week. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
affidavit, 0
when 0
they 0
searched 0
his 0
home, 0
police 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
found 0
10.4 0
grams 0
of 0
pot—less 0
than 0
half 0
an 0
ounce. 0

Police 0
also 0
said 0
they 0
found 0
two 0
fired 0
cartridge 0
casings, 0
a 0
police 0
backpack 0
and 0
vest, 0
and 0
a 0
metal 0
marijuana 0
grinder—the 0
horror. 1

Even 1
if 1
police 1
did 1
find 1
marijuana, 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
would 1
they 1
execute 1
a 1
search 1
warrant 1
on 1
an 1
innocent 1
dead 1
man’s 1
home 1
and 1
then 1
release 1
that 1
information 1
to 1
the 1

“They 0
[police] 0
immediately 0
began 0
looking 0
to 0
smear 1
him,” 0
attorney 0
Lee 0
Merritt 0
said. 0

“I 0
think 0
it’s 0
unfortunate 1
that 0
law 0
enforcement 0
begin 0
to 0
immediately 0
criminalize 0
the 0
victim—in 0
this 0
case, 0
someone 0
who 0
was 0
clearly 0
was 0
the 0
victim 0
that 0
has 0
absolutely 0
no 0
bearing 0
on 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
his 0
home,” 0
Merritt 0
added 0
to 0
Fox 0
4. 0

Pointing 0
out 0
the 0
glaring 1
nature 0
of 0
the 0
smear 1
campaign 0
was 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
absolutely 0
zero 0
information 0
released 0
about 0
the 0
warrants 0
conducted 0
on 0
officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
the 0
killer 1
cop 1
who 0
lived 0
just 0
below 0
Jean. 0

“I 0
would 0
love 0
to 0
see 0
more 0
information 0
coming 0
out 0
about 0
the 0
warrants 0
executed 0
on 0
the 0
home 0
of 0
the 0
shooter 0
who 0
lived 0
just 0
below 0
him. 0

I 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any 0
of 0
those,” 0
said 0
Merritt. 0

Merritt 0
accused 0
the 0
department 0
of 0
conducting 0
a 0
“common 0
assassination 0
attempt 0
on 0
the 0
victim 0
that 0
we 0
often 0
see 0
in 0
law 0
enforcement 0
involved 0
shootings.” 0
Sadly, 0
he 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
correct 0
in 0
his 0
accusations. 0

It 0
is 0
standard 0
procedure 0
for 0
police 0
to 0
dig 1
up 1
dirt 1
on 1
their 0
victims 0
in 0
attempts 0
to 0
smear 1
and 0
assassinate 0
their 0
character 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
killer 1
cops 1
look 0
good 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
eye. 0

Even 0
sadder, 0
however, 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
these 0
smear 1
campaigns 0
work 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
time. 0

As 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
reported 0
on 0
Wednesday, 0
according 0
to 0
police 0
— 0
who 0
continue 0
to 0
attempt 0
to 0
spin 0
this 0
story 0
into 0
some 0
tragic 0
mistake 0
— 0
Guyger 0
accidentally 0
went 0
into 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment, 0
mistook 0
Jean 0
for 0
an 0
intruder 0
and 0
killed 0
him. 0

“Guyger 0
entered 0
the 0
building 0
and 0
walked 0
down 0
the 0
fourth-floor 0
hallway 0
to 0
what 0
she 0
thought 0
was 0
her 0
apartment,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
arrest 0
warrant 0
made 0
public 0
Monday 0
afternoon. 0

“She 0
inserted 0
a 0
unique 0
door 0
key, 0
with 0
an 0
electronic 0
chip, 0
into 0
the 0
door 0
keyhole. 0

The 0
door, 0
which 0
was 0
slightly 0
ajar 0
prior 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
arrival, 0
fully 0
opened 0
under 0
the 0
force 0
of 0
the 0
key 0
insertion.” 0

“Guyger 0
drew 0
her 0
firearm, 0
gave 0
verbal 0
commands 0
that 0
were 0
ignored 0
by 0
… 0
Jean,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
warrant. 0

“Guyger 0
fired 0
her 0
handgun 0
two 0
times 0
striking 0
[Jean] 0
in 0
the 0
torso. 0

Guyger 0
entered 0
the 0
apartment, 0
immediately 0
called 0
911, 0
requesting 0
police 0
and 0
EMS, 0
and 0
provided 0
first 0
aid 0
to 0
… 0
Jean. 0

“Due 0
to 0
the 0
interior 0
darkness 0
of 0
the 0
apartment, 0
Guyger 0
turned 0
on 0
the 0
interior 0
lights 0
while 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
with 0
911. 0

Upon 0
being 0
asked 0
where 0
she 0
was 0
located 0
by 0
emergency 0
dispatchers, 0
Guyger 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
front 0
door 0
to 0
observe 0
the 0
address 0
and 0
discovered 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
arrest 0
warrant. 0

At 0
no 0
time, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
warrant, 0
does 0
Guyger 0
say 0
what 0
“verbal 0
commands” 0
she 0
gave. 0

What’s 0
more, 0
any 0
verbal 0
commands 0
she 0
did 0
give 0
were 0
entirely 0
irrelevant 0
as 0
she 0
was 0
the 0
intruder—not 0
Jean. 0

Attempting 0
to 0
imply 0
that 0
Jean 0
was 0
somehow 0
at 0
fault 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
death 0
for 0
disobeying 0
the 0
commands 0
of 0
a 0
homicidal 1
cop 1
who’d 0
just 0
illegally 0
broken 0
into 0
his 0
home 0
is 0
as 0
irresponsible 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
reprehensible. 0

What’s 0
more, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
attorneys 0
for 0
Jean, 0
when 0
Guyger 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
with 0
police, 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address 0
of 0
the 0
apartment—implying 0
that 0
she 0
knew 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

“From 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
when 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
an 0
affidavit 0
and 0
I’m 0
thinking 0
that 0
I’m 0
at 0
my 0
house 0
and 0
I 0
call 0
911 0
because 0
someone 0
was 0
just 0
shot,” 0
Attorney 0
Daryl 0
Washington 0
said. 0

“Well, 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
thing 0
that 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
I’m 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
and 0
look 0
at 0
my 0
address? 0

I’m 0
going 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
my 0
address 0
right 0
there 0
on 0
the 0
phone. 0

I’m 0
going 0
to 0
say 0
I’m 0
on 0
the 0
phone. 0

My 0
address 0
is 0
this. 0

Why 0
did 0
she 0
have 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address? 0

It 0
makes 0
no 0
sense 0
whatsoever.” 0

Even 0
more 0
ominous 1
than 0
having 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
according 0
to 0
witnesses, 0
Guyger’s 0
story 0
of 0
inserting 0
the 0
key 0
into 0
Jean’s 0
door 0
and 0
it 0
opening 0
up 0
was 0
simply 0
not 0
true. 0

According 0
to 0
witnesses, 0
Guyger 0
was 0
banging 0
on 0
Jean’s 0
door, 0
demanding 0
he 0
let 0
her 0
in. 0

“Independent 0
witnesses 0
have 0
already 0
come 0
forward 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
they 0
heard 0
this 0
officer 0
pounding 0
on 0
the 0
door 0
and 0
demanding 0
to 0
be 0
let 0
in,” 0
Lee 0
Merritt, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
attorneys 0
representing 0
the 0
Jean 0
family, 0
told 0
ABC 0
News. 0

“The 0
contradictions 0
begin 0
to 0
build 0
from 0
there.” 0

The 0
doors 0
in 0
the 0
complex 0
are 0
also 0
equipped 0
with 0
an 0
automatic 0
closing 0
mechanism. 0

This 0
was 0
demonstrated 0
by 0
the 0
attorneys 0
who 0
opened 0
the 0
door 0
and 0
released 0
it 0
several 0
times—showing 0
that 0
it 0
closed 0
every 0
single 0
time—blowing 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
door 0
was 0
somehow 0
ajar 0
completely 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
water. 0

Jean’s 0
family 0
also 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
incredibly 0
unlikely 0
for 0
Guyger 0
to 0
mistake 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
for 0
her 0
own 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
distinct 0
red 0
door 0
mat 0
which 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
enough 0
for 0
the 0
cop 0
to 0
know 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
place. 0

The 0
hallway 0
outside 0
the 0
apartment 0

was 0
shot 0

a 0

Even 0
as 0
cops 0
come 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
defense 0
and 0
attempt 0
to 0
shame, 0
smear, 1
and 0
discredit 0
her 0
victim—who 0
was 0
an 0
upstanding 1
member 1
of 1
society 1
regardless 0
of 0
the 0
plant 0
they 0
claim 0
to 0
have 0
found—they 0
are 0
failing 0
miserably. 1

Despite 0
cops 0
rallying 0
behind 0
the 0
blue 0
line 0
to 0
defend 0
this 0
killer 1
cop, 1
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
country 0
is 0
not 0
buying 0
it. 0

In 0
a 0
damning 0
tweet, 0
writer 0
Kashana 0
Cauley 0
summed 0
up 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
smear 1
campaign 0
quite 0
succinctly. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
cops 0
claiming 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
tiny 0
bit 0
of 0
weed, 0
she 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
also 0
a 0
homicidal 1
cop 1
inside 0
too. 0

His 0
apartment 0
also 0
contained 0
an 0
off 0
duty 0
homicidal 1
cop. 1
