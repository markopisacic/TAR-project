The 0 255 2
indoctrination 1 255 2
is 0 255 2
getting 0 255 2

The 0 255 4

“the 0 255 4

“When 0 255 5

That’s 0 255 8
just 0 255 8

a 0 255 10

said 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
top 0 255 13
three 0 255 13
reasons 0 255 13
that 0 255 13
parents 0 255 13
choose 0 255 13

are 0 255 13
a 0 255 13
desire 0 255 13
to 0 255 13
provide 0 255 13
religious 0 255 13
instruction 0 255 13
or 0 255 13
different 0 255 13

than 0 255 13
those 0 255 13
offered 0 255 13
in 0 255 13
public 0 255 13
schools; 0 255 13
dissatisfaction 0 255 13
with 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
academic 0 255 13
curriculum, 0 255 13
and 0 255 13
worries 0 255 13
about 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
school 0 255 13
environment. 0 255 13

Since 0 255 14

not 0 255 14

to 0 255 14

violence 1 255 14
often 0 255 14
perpetrated 0 255 14
at 0 255 14
schools 0 255 14
simply 0 255 14
because 0 255 14
they 0 255 14
are 0 255 14
gun 0 255 14
free 0 255 14
zones, 0 255 14
homeschooling 0 255 14
takes 0 255 14
care 0 255 14
of 0 255 14
that 0 255 14
problem. 0 255 14

“Most 0 255 15
parents 0 255 15
homeschool 0 255 15
for 0 255 15
more 0 255 15
than 0 255 15
one 0 255 15
reason,” 0 255 15
Ray 0 255 15
told 0 255 15
the 0 255 15
paper. 0 255 15

“But 0 255 16
when 0 255 16
we 0 255 16
ask 0 255 16
families 0 255 16
why 0 255 16
do 0 255 16
they 0 255 16
homeschool, 0 255 16
near 0 255 16
the 0 255 16
top 0 255 16
nowadays 0 255 16

all 0 255 17
of 0 255 17
that.” 0 255 17

Indoctrination 1 255 18
means 0 255 18
to 0 255 18
teach 0 255 18
a 0 255 18
person 0 255 18
to 0 255 18
accept 0 255 18
a 0 255 18

uncritically. 0 255 18

It’s 1 255 19
the 1 255 19
very 1 255 19
reason 1 255 19
the 1 255 19
governments 1 255 19

critically 0 255 20
understand 0 255 20
that 0 255 20
hurting 0 255 20
people 0 255 20
and 0 255 20
taking 0 255 20
their 0 255 20
things 0 255 20
is 0 255 20
wrong 0 255 20
– 0 255 20
even 0 255 20
if 0 255 20
people 0 255 20
who 0 255 20
declare 0 255 20
themselves 0 255 20
government 0 255 20
is 0 255 20
the 0 255 20
one 0 255 20
doing 0 255 20
it. 0 255 20

Governments 1 255 21
are 1 255 21
nothing 1 255 21
more 1 255 21
than 1 255 21
a 1 255 21
handful 1 255 21
of 1 255 21
people 1 255 21
and 0 255 21
have 0 255 21

right 0 255 21
to 0 255 21
aggress 0 255 21
against 0 255 21
