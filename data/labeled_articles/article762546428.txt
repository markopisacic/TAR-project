Violence 1

Homeschooling 0
rates 0
are 0
skyrocketing 1
as 0
parents 0
are 0
continually 0
getting 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
upset 0
at 0
the 0
leftist 1
social 1
engineering 1
taking 0
place 0
in 0
public 0
schools. 0

The 0
indoctrination 1
is 0
getting 0
so 1
bad, 1
that 0
some 0
parents 0
are 0
even 0
concerned 1
about 0
liberal 0
violence 1
against 0
those 0
who 0
reject 0
the 0
brainwashing. 1

According 0
to 0
The 0
Washington 0
Times, 0
the 0
recent 0
school 0
shooting 0
at 0
Parkland, 0
Florida, 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
straw 0
for 0
scores 0
of 0
parents. 0

The 0
paper 0
noted 0
that 0
“the 0
phones 0
started 0
ringing 0
at 0
the 0
Texas 0
Home 0
School 0
Coalition, 0
and 0
they 0
haven’t 0
stopped 0
yet.” 0

“When 0
the 0
Parkland 0
shooting 0
happened, 0
our 0
phone 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
exploded,” 1
said 0
coalition 0
president 0
Tim 0
Lambert. 0

“In 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
months, 0
our 0
numbers 0
have 0
doubled. 0

We’re 0
dealing 0
with 0
probably 0
between 0
1,200 0
and 0
1,400 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
per 0
month, 0
and 0
prior 0
to 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
600 0
to 0
700.” 0
But 0
according 0
to 0
Natural 0
News, 0
it 0
isn’t 0
just 0
the 0
rampant 1
violence 1
worrying 0
some 0
parents. 0

That’s 0
just 0
the 0
tip 0
of 0
the 0
collectivist 0
agenda 0
iceberg. 0

Christopher 0
Chin, 0
head 0
of 0
Homeschool 0
Louisiana, 0
told 0
The 0
Times 0
that 0
parents 0
are 0
fed 0
up 0
with 0
“the 0
violence, 1
the 0
bullying, 1
the 0
unsafe 0
environments.” 0
Many 0
parents 0
are 0
also 0
disturbed 1
by 0
the 0
social 1
engineering, 1
which 0
amounts 0
to 0
brainwashing 1
and 0
indoctrination 1
that 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
a 0
public 0
school. 0

For 0
example, 0
a 0
Minnesota 0
public 0
school 0
is 0
forcing 1
Kindergarten 0
students 0
to 0
study 0
‘white 0
privilege’. 0

The 0
left-wing 0
curriculum 0
and 0
common 0
core 0
are 0
also 0
driving 0
parents 0
to 0
remove 0
their 0
children 0
from 0
public 0
schools. 0

Brian 0
D. 0
Ray, 0
who 0
heads 0
up 0
the 0
National 0
Home 0
Education 0
Research 0
Institute, 0
in 0
Salem, 0
Oregon, 0
who’s 0
conducted 0
homeschooling 0
research 0
for 0
33 0
years, 0
told 0
The 0
Times 0
that 0
concern 1
over 0
school 0
curriculum 0
has 0
reached 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
charts 0
for 0
most 0
parents. 0

Ray 0
said 0
the 0
top 0
three 0
reasons 0
that 0
parents 0
choose 0
homeschooling 0
are 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
provide 0
religious 0
instruction 0
or 0
different 0
values 0
than 0
those 0
offered 0
in 0
public 0
schools; 0
dissatisfaction 0
with 0
the 0
academic 0
curriculum, 0
and 0
worries 0
about 0
the 0
school 0
environment. 0

Since 0
teachers 0
are 0
not 0
allowed 0
to 0
arm 0
themselves 0
to 0
defend 0
their 0
students 0
against 0
the 0
violence 1
often 0
perpetrated 0
at 0
schools 0
simply 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
gun 0
free 0
zones, 0
homeschooling 0
takes 0
care 0
of 0
that 0
problem. 0

“Most 0
parents 0
homeschool 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
reason,” 0
Ray 0
told 0
the 0
paper. 0

“But 0
when 0
we 0
ask 0
families 0
why 0
do 0
they 0
homeschool, 0
near 0
the 0
top 0
nowadays 0
is 0
concern 1
about 0
the 0
environment 0
of 0
schools, 0
and 0
that 0
includes 0
safety, 0
pressure 0
to 0
get 0
into 0
drugs, 0
pressure 0
to 0
get 0
into 0
sexual 0
activity. 0

It 0
includes 0
all 0
of 0
that.” 0

Indoctrination 1
means 0
to 0
teach 0
a 0
person 0
to 0
accept 0
a 0
belief 0
uncritically. 0

It’s 1
the 1
very 1
reason 1
the 1
governments 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
still 1
exist. 1

People 0
cannot 0
logically 0
and 0
critically 0
understand 0
that 0
hurting 0
people 0
and 0
taking 0
their 0
things 0
is 0
wrong 0
– 0
even 0
if 0
people 0
who 0
declare 0
themselves 0
government 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
doing 0
it. 0

Governments 1
are 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
people 1
and 0
have 0
no 0
right 0
to 0
aggress 0
against 0
others. 0

But 0
humans 0
are 0
taught 0
at 0
a 0
young 0
age 0
to 0
never 0
question 0
this 0
and 0
that 0
belief 0
has 0
kept 0
most 0
of 0
humanity 0
enslaved 1
for 0
centuries. 0

﻿ 0

It 0
isn’t 0
a 0
surprise 0
that 0
so 0
many 0
have 0
decided 0
to 0
educate 0
their 0
children 0
themselves. 0

And 0
as 0
schools 0
continue 0
to 0
fail, 0
and 0
authoritarian 1
policies 0
continue 0
to 0
wreak 1
havoc 1
on 0
our 1
society, 1
more 0
will 0
wake 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
absolute 1
horror 1
of 0
what 0
allowing 0
the 0
state 0
to 0
educate 0
our 0
children 0
has 0
done 0
to 0
the 0
moral 0
fabric 0
of 0
humanity. 0
