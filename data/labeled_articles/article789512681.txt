was 0
an 0

panel 0
at 0
the 0
Education 0
Minnesota 0
Apple 0
Valley 0
open 0
to 0
union 0
members 0
and 0
guests. 0

Prior 0
to 0
the 0
event, 0
Ellison's 0
campaign 0
called 0
police 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
"protected" 0
from 0
a 0
woman 0
armed 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
camera 0
phone 0
. 0

Loomer 0
peppered 0
him 0
with 0
questions 0
about 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
at 0
a 0
State 0
Attorney 0
General 0
debate 0
Friday 0
night. 0

She 0
stood 0
alongside 0
other 0
female 0
survivors 0
of 0
abuse. 0

Ellison 0
not 0
only 0
claimed 0
the 0
women 0
were 0
lying 0
but 0
then 0
fled 0
the 0
scene. 0

At 0
least 0
he 0
said 0
something 0
there, 0
which 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
for 0
his 0
response 0
earlier 0
in 0
September 0
when 0
Loomer 0
confronted 0
him 0
at 0
another 0
event 0
with 0
questions. 0

Failing 0
to 0
answer, 0
Ellison 0
tried 0
to 0
move 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person, 0
allowing 0
his 0
minions 1
to 0
try 0
and 0
provide 0
cover 0
for 0
him, 0
similar 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
Maxine 0
Waters, 0
but 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
"member's 0
only" 0
elevator 0
to 0
flee 0
into. 0

Finally, 0
Ellison 0
fled 0
the 0
scene, 0
hounding 0
by 0
Loomer 0
and 0
others 0
questioning 0
him 0
about 0
the 0
abuse. 0

The 0
irony 0
is 0
of 0
Ellison's 0
campaign 0
calling 0
on 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
from 0
a 0
woman, 0
armed 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
camera 0
phone, 0
who 0
is 0
simply 0
asking 0
him 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
the 0
accusations 0
and 0
police 0
report, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
how 0
he 0
plans 0
on 0
being 0
attorney 0
general 0
without 0
a 0
license, 0
when 0
he 0
has 0
shown 0
his 0
support 0
for 0
those 0
that 0
murder 0
police 0
officers 0
in 0
cold 0
blood. 0

Scott 0

reports 0
on 0

of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0

in 0

before 0

some 0
detail 0
in 0
the 0
October 0
9, 0
2006 0
issue 0
of 0
The 0

Ellison 0
has 0
baldly 0
dissembled 0
about 0
this 0
history 0
since 0
2006. 0

In 0
his 0
2014 0
memoir 0
My 0
Country, 0
‚ÄôTis 0
of 0
Thee 0
,for 0
example, 0
Ellison 0
simply 0
omitted 0
it 0
and 0
presented 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
critic 0
of 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam. 0

This 0
past 0
June, 0
Ellison 0
told 0
Jake 0
Tapper 0
on 0
CNN, 0
‚ÄúI 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
Million 0
Man 0
March 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
proud 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

That‚Äôs 0
it.‚Äù 0
But 0
that 0
wasn‚Äôt 0
it. 0

Ellison 0
first 0
sought 0
office 0
as 0
a 0
Democrat 0
in 0
1998 0
as 0
Keith 0
Ellison-Muhammad, 0
a 0
self-avowed 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam. 0

(Ellison-Muhammad 0
is 0
just 0
one 0
of 0
three 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
names 0
Ellison 0
has 0
used 0
over 0
the 0
years.) 0

Fortunately 0
for 0
him, 0
Ellison‚Äôs 0
5th 0
District 0
constituents 0
haven‚Äôt 0
much 0
cared 0
about 0
his 0
history 0
and 0
the 0
Minneapolis 0
Star 0
Tribune 0
has 0
almost 0
entirely 0
let 0
it 0
rest 0
exactly 0
where 0
Ellison 0
wants 0
it. 0

But 0
seeking 0
the 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
job 0
in 0
Minnesota 0
and 0
running 0
for 0
statewide 0
office 0
should 0
be 0
a 0
more 0
daunting 0
challenge 0
because 0
Ellison 0
is 0
an 0
extraordinarily 1
poor 1
fit 1
for 0
the 0
job. 0

Among 0
the 0
troubling 0
threads 0
that 0
run 0
through 0
Ellison‚Äôs 0
career: 0
support 0
for 0
cop 1
killers. 1

In 0
September 0
1992 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
officer 0
Jerry 0
Haaf 0
was 0
murdered 1
execution-style, 1
shot 0
in 0
the 0
back 0
as 0
he 0
took 0
a 0
coffee 0
break 0
at 0
a 0
restaurant 0
in 0
south 0
Minneapolis. 0

Police 0
later 0
determined 0
that 0
Haaf‚Äôs 0
murder 0
was 0
a 0
gang 0
hit 0
performed 0
by 0
four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
city‚Äôs 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
gang.The 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
was 0
Sharif 0
Willis, 0
a 0
convicted 0
murderer 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
released 0
from 0
prison 0
and 0
who 0
sought 0
respectability 0
as 0
a 0
responsible 0
gang 0
leader 0
from 0
gullible 0
municipal 0
authorities 0
while 0
operating 0
a 0
gang 0
front 0
called 0
United 0
for 0
Peace. 0

The 0
four 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
members 0
who 0
murdered 0
Haaf 0
met 0
and 0
planned 0
the 0
murder 0
at 0
Willis‚Äôs 0
house. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
two 0
witnesses 0
implicated 0
Willis 0
in 0
the 0
planning 0
he 0
was 0
never 0
charged 0
because 0
law 0
enforcement 0
authorities 0
said 0
they 0
lacked 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
convict 0
him. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Ellison 0
was 0
a 0
Minneapolis 0
attorney 0
in 0
private 0
practice. 0

And 0
within 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
Haaf‚Äôs 0
murder, 0
Ellison 0
appeared 0
with 0
Willis 0
supporting 0
the 0
United 0
for 0
Peace 0
gang 0
front. 0

In 0
October 0
1992, 0
Ellison 0
helped 0
organize 0
a 0
demonstration 0
against 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
that 0
included 0
United 0
for 0
Peace. 0

‚ÄúThe 0
main 0
point 0
of 0
our 0
rally 0
is 0
to 0
support 0
United 0
for 0

[in 0
its 0
fight 0
against] 0
the 0
campaign 0

waging,‚Äù 0
said 0
Ellison. 0

Willis 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
speaker 0
at 0
the 0
demonstration. 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
contemporaneous 0
report 0
in 0
the 0
St. 0
Paul 0
Pioneer 0
Press, 0
Willis 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
that 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
were 0
experiencing 0
the 0
same 0
fear 0
from 0
young 0
black 0
men 0
that 0
blacks 0
had 0
felt 0
from 0
police 0
for 0
many 0
years. 0

‚ÄúIf 0
the 0
police 0
have 0
some 0
fear, 0
I 0
understand 0
that 0
fear,‚Äù 0
Willis 0
said. 0

‚ÄúWe 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
an 0
overabundance 0
of 0
bad 1
police. 0

[W]e‚Äôre 0

Willis 0
said. 0

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve 1
got 1
to 1
go.‚Äù 1
The 0
Pioneer 0
Press 0
account 0
concludes 0
with 0
Ellison‚Äôs 0
contribution 0
to 0
the 0
demonstration: 0
‚ÄúEllison 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
that 0

is 0
systematically 0
frightening 0
whites 0

order 0
to 0
get 0
more 0

way, 0

said, 0
the 0

can 0
increase 0
its 0
power 0
base.‚Äù 0
Ellison 0
publicly 0
supported 0
the 0
Haaf 0
murder 0
defendants. 0

In 0
February 0
1993, 0
he 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
demonstration 0
for 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
during 0
his 0
trial. 0

Ellison 0
led 0
the 0
crowd 0
assembled 0
at 0
the 0
courthouse 0
in 0
a 0
chant 0
that 0
was 0
ominous 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
Haaf‚Äôs 0
cold-blooded 0
murder: 0
‚ÄúWe 1
don‚Äôt 1
get 1
no 1
justice, 1
you 1
don‚Äôt 1
get 1
no 1
peace.‚Äù 1
Ellison‚Äôs 0
working 0
relationship 0
with 0
Sharif 0
Willis 0
finally 0
came 0
to 0
an 0
end 0
in 0
February 0
1995, 0
when 0
Willis 0
was 0
convicted 0
in 0
federal 0
court 0
on 0
several 0
counts 0
of 0
drug 0
and 0
gun-related 0
crimes 0
and 0
sent 0
back 0
to 0
prison 0
for 0
20 0
years. 0

The 0
Haaf 0
case 0
wasn‚Äôt 0
an 0
aberration 0
for 0
Ellison. 0

In 0
February 0
2000, 0
he 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
fundraiser 0
sponsored 0
by 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
chapter 0
of 0

National 0

who 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
fugitive 0
from 0

for 0
25 0

on 0
charges 0
related 0
to 0

of 0

officers 0
in 0
1975. 0

‚ÄúAssata 0

a 0
riveting 0
account 0
of 0
Chesimard‚Äôs 0
terrorist 0
career. 0

In 0
2013, 0
the 0

of 0
up 0
to 0

Yet 0
Ellison 0
prayed 0
for 0
Chesimard 0
in 0
his 0
National 0

speech: 0
‚ÄúI 0
am 0

Ellison‚Äôs 0
support 0
for 0

in 0
the 0

is 0
equally 0
notable. 0
