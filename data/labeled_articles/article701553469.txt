then 1 361 2
they 1 361 2

Jewish 0 361 3

The 0 361 7
ratification 0 361 7
vote 0 361 7
is 0 361 7
typically 0 361 7
a 0 361 7
mere 0 361 7
formality, 0 361 7
but 0 361 7
Monday’s 0 361 7
was 0 361 7
different 0 361 7
due 0 361 7

Democratize 0 361 8
SSMU 0 361 8
was 0 361 8
able 0 361 8
to 0 361 8
pass 0 361 8
a 0 361 8
motion 0 361 8
that 0 361 8
required 0 361 8
each 0 361 8
board 0 361 8
member 0 361 8
to 0 361 8
be 0 361 8

upon 0 361 8
separately 0 361 8
under 0 361 8
the 0 361 8
grounds 0 361 8
that 0 361 8
they 0 361 8
weren’t 0 361 8
a 0 361 8
fan 0 361 8
of 0 361 8
the 0 361 8

When 0 361 9
it 0 361 9
was 0 361 9
Lew’s 0 361 9
turn, 0 361 9
he 0 361 9
was 0 361 9
voted 0 361 9
down, 0 361 9
105 0 361 9
to 0 361 9

Two 0 361 10

were 0 361 10
also 0 361 10
voted 0 361 10
down. 0 361 10

Democratize 0 361 11
SSMU 0 361 11
had 0 361 11
targeted 0 361 11
Lew 0 361 11
and 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
other 0 361 11
two 0 361 11
students 0 361 11
on 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
board 0 361 11
because 0 361 11
they 0 361 11
had 0 361 11
connections 0 361 11
to 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
Canadian 0 361 11
Jewish 0 361 11
Political 0 361 11
Affairs 0 361 11
Committee 0 361 11
(CJPAC) 0 361 11
and 0 361 11
were 0 361 11
involved 0 361 11
in 0 361 11
getting 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
BDS 0 361 11
ban 0 361 11
passed, 0 361 11
which 0 361 11
Democratize 0 361 11
SSMU 0 361 11
claimed 0 361 11
were 0 361 11
“conflicts 0 361 11
of 0 361 11
interests.” 0 361 11

Somehow 0 361 12
I 0 361 12
don't 0 361 12
think 0 361 12
being 0 361 12
a 0 361 12
member 0 361 12
of 0 361 12
a 0 361 12
Muslim 0 361 12
student 0 361 12
group 0 361 12
and 0 361 12
supporting 0 361 12
BDS 0 361 12
would 0 361 12
be 0 361 12
considered 0 361 12
a 0 361 12
conflict 0 361 12
of 0 361 12
interest. 0 361 12

But 0 361 13
the 1 361 13
campus 1 361 13
anti-Israel 1 361 13
crowd 1 361 13
has 0 361 13
been 0 361 13
working 0 361 13
rather 0 361 13
hard 0 361 13
to 0 361 13
intimidate 0 361 13
and 0 361 13
penalize 0 361 13
anyone 0 361 13
involved 0 361 13
in 0 361 13
pro-Israel 0 361 13
organizations. 0 361 13

And 0 361 14
to 0 361 14
keep 0 361 14
their 0 361 14
racist 1 361 14
boycott 1 361 14
movement 1 361 14

by 0 361 14

over 0 361 14

Lew 0 361 15

“I 0 361 16

this 1 361 16

about 1 361 16

nothing 1 361 16

Lew 0 361 17
added 0 361 17
that 0 361 17
the 0 361 17

Lew. 0 361 18

“If 1 361 19

On 0 361 21
Monday 0 361 21
night, 0 361 21
three 0 361 21
students 0 361 21
were 0 361 21
removed 0 361 21
from 0 361 21
the 0 361 21
Board 0 361 21
of 0 361 21
Directors 0 361 21
of 0 361 21
the 0 361 21

McGill 0 361 21
University 0 361 21

McGill’s 0 361 21
main 0 361 21
student 0 361 21

All 0 361 22
three 0 361 22
were 0 361 22
targeted 0 361 22
for 0 361 22
removal 0 361 22
either 0 361 22
because 0 361 22
they 0 361 22
are 0 361 22
Jewish 0 361 22
or 0 361 22
have 0 361 22
vocally 0 361 22
opposed 0 361 22
anti-Jewish 0 361 22
discrimination 0 361 22
on 0 361 22
campus. 0 361 22

This 0 361 23
episode 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
utterly 1 361 23
unacceptable, 1 361 23
and 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
merely 0 361 23
the 0 361 23
latest 0 361 23
in 0 361 23
a 0 361 23
long 0 361 23
string 0 361 23
of 0 361 23
antisemitic 0 361 23
incidents 0 361 23
at 0 361 23
your 0 361 23
university. 0 361 23

Indeed, 0 361 24
according 0 361 24
to 0 361 24
eyewitnesses, 0 361 24
one 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
members 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
mob 0 361 24
that 0 361 24
removed 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
three 0 361 24
directors 0 361 24
was 0 361 24
Igor 0 361 24
Sadikov. 0 361 24

You 0 361 25
will 0 361 25
remember 0 361 25
Sadikov 0 361 25
as 0 361 25
the 0 361 25
student 0 361 25
politician 0 361 25
who 0 361 25
in 0 361 25
February 0 361 25
told 0 361 25
his 0 361 25
followers 0 361 25
to 0 361 25
“punch 1 361 25
a 1 361 25
Zionist 1 361 25
today.” 1 361 25
It 0 361 25
is 0 361 25
unclear 0 361 25
whether 0 361 25
Sadikov 0 361 25
has 0 361 25
faced 0 361 25
any 0 361 25
disciplinary 0 361 25
action 0 361 25
for 0 361 25
this 0 361 25
incitement 0 361 25
to 0 361 25
violence 0 361 25
from 0 361 25
your 0 361 25
administration. 0 361 25

Antisemitism 0 361 26
at 0 361 26
McGill 0 361 26
does 0 361 26
not 0 361 26
emerge 0 361 26
from 0 361 26
a 0 361 26
vacuum. 0 361 26

Rather, 0 361 27
it 0 361 27
has 0 361 27
been 0 361 27
nurtured 0 361 27
in 0 361 27
part 0 361 27
by 0 361 27
a 1 361 27
toxic 1 361 27
campus 1 361 27
press, 1 361 27
especially 0 361 27
the 0 361 27
McGill 0 361 27
Daily, 0 361 27
a 0 361 27
publication 0 361 27
which 0 361 27
openly 0 361 27
refuses 0 361 27
to 0 361 27
publish 0 361 27
any 0 361 27
“Zionist” 0 361 27
content. 0 361 27

In 0 361 28
practice, 0 361 28
this 0 361 28
prevents 0 361 28
McGill’s 0 361 28
Jewish 0 361 28
community 0 361 28
from 0 361 28
defending 0 361 28
itself 0 361 28
against 0 361 28
the 1 361 28
absurd 1 361 28
attacks 1 361 28
to 0 361 28
which 0 361 28
it 0 361 28
is 0 361 28
subjected. 0 361 28

If 0 361 29
the 0 361 29
Daily 0 361 29
is 0 361 29
committed 0 361 29
to 0 361 29
systematically 0 361 29
excluding 0 361 29
the 0 361 29
voices 0 361 29
of 0 361 29
an 0 361 29
ethno-religious 0 361 29
community 0 361 29
on 0 361 29
campus, 0 361 29
then 0 361 29
it 0 361 29
cannot 0 361 29
continue 0 361 29
to 0 361 29
receive 0 361 29
automatic 0 361 29
student 0 361 29
funding, 0 361 29
as 0 361 29
it 0 361 29
does 0 361 29
now. 0 361 29

The 0 361 30
double 0 361 30
standard 0 361 30
here 0 361 30
is 0 361 30
pretty 0 361 30
clear. 0 361 30

And 0 361 31
we 0 361 31
know 1 361 31
exactly 1 361 31
what 1 361 31
the 1 361 31
reaction 1 361 31
would 1 361 31
be 1 361 31
if 1 361 31
a 1 361 31
student 1 361 31
paper 1 361 31
refused 1 361 31
to 1 361 31
publish 1 361 31
any 1 361 31
pro-Islamist 1 361 31
content. 1 361 31
