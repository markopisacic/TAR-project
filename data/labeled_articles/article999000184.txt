to 0 413 1
Congress. 0 413 1

The 0 413 2
establishment 0 413 2
media 0 413 2
will 0 413 2
celebrate 0 413 2
these 0 413 2
victories 0 413 2
as 0 413 2
triumphs 1 413 2
of 1 413 2
America’s 1 413 2

unfortunately, 1 413 2
in 1 413 2
reality 1 413 2
neither 1 413 2
one 1 413 2
is 1 413 2
worth 1 413 2
celebrating. 1 413 2

Tlaib 0 413 3
is 0 413 3
a 0 413 3
vociferous 0 413 3
foe 0 413 3
of 0 413 3
Israel. 0 413 3

With 0 413 4
the 0 413 4
Democrats 0 413 4
now 0 413 4
regaining 0 413 4
control 0 413 4
of 0 413 4
the 0 413 4

Tlaib 0 413 4
is 0 413 4
likely 0 413 4
to 0 413 4
be 0 413 4
an 0 413 4
energetic 0 413 4
proponent 0 413 4
of 0 413 4
the 0 413 4
new 0 413 4
majority’s 0 413 4
vendetta 1 413 4
against 1 413 4
the 0 413 4
Middle 0 413 4
East’s 0 413 4
only 0 413 4
democracy. 0 413 4

The 0 413 5
House 0 413 5
is 0 413 5
likely 0 413 5
to 0 413 5
do 0 413 5
all 0 413 5
it 0 413 5
can 0 413 5
to 0 413 5
roll 0 413 5
back 0 413 5
President 0 413 5
Trump’s 0 413 5
pro-Israel 0 413 5
polices, 0 413 5
with 0 413 5
Tlaib 0 413 5
as 0 413 5
well 0 413 5
as 0 413 5
Omar 0 413 5
as 0 413 5
becoming 0 413 5
the 0 413 5
public 0 413 5
faces 0 413 5
of 0 413 5
the 0 413 5
effort. 0 413 5

According 0 413 6
to 0 413 6
the 0 413 6
JTA, 0 413 6
when 0 413 6
Tlaib 0 413 6
was 0 413 6
asked 0 413 6
if 0 413 6
she 0 413 6
would 0 413 6
vote 0 413 6
against 0 413 6
military 0 413 6
aid 0 413 6
to 0 413 6
Israel, 0 413 6
Tlaib 0 413 6
responded: 0 413 6
“Absolutely, 0 413 6
if 0 413 6
it 0 413 6
has 0 413 6
something 0 413 6
to 0 413 6
do 0 413 6
with 0 413 6
inequality 0 413 6
and 0 413 6
not 0 413 6
access 0 413 6
to 0 413 6
people 0 413 6
having 0 413 6
justice. 0 413 6

For 1 413 7
me, 1 413 7
U.S. 1 413 7
aid 1 413 7
should 1 413 7
be 1 413 7
leverage. 1 413 7

I 1 413 8
will 1 413 8
be 1 413 8
using 1 413 8
my 1 413 8
position 1 413 8
in 1 413 8
Congress 1 413 8
so 1 413 8
that 1 413 8
no 1 413 8
country, 1 413 8
not 1 413 8
one, 1 413 8
should 1 413 8
be 1 413 8
able 1 413 8
to 1 413 8
get 1 413 8
aid 1 413 8
from 1 413 8
the 1 413 8
U.S. 1 413 8
when 1 413 8
they 1 413 8
still 1 413 8
promote 1 413 8
that 1 413 8
kind 1 413 8
of 1 413 8
injustice.” 1 413 8

What 0 413 9
kind 0 413 9
of 0 413 9
injustice? 0 413 9

Tlaib, 1 413 10
of 1 413 10
course, 1 413 10
had 1 413 10
nothing 1 413 10
to 1 413 10
say 1 413 10
about 1 413 10
the 1 413 10
genocidal 1 413 10
incitement 1 413 10
against 1 413 10
Jews 1 413 10
and 1 413 10
Israel 1 413 10
that 1 413 10
regularly 1 413 10
features 1 413 10
on 1 413 10
Palestinian 1 413 10
television. 1 413 10

She 0 413 11
did 0 413 11
say, 0 413 11
however, 0 413 11
that 0 413 11
she 0 413 11
favors 0 413 11
a 0 413 11
one-state, 0 413 11
not 0 413 11
two-state, 0 413 11
“solution” 0 413 11
to 0 413 11
the 0 413 11
Israeli-Palestinian 0 413 11
conflict: 0 413 11
“One 0 413 11
state. 0 413 11

It 0 413 12
has 0 413 12
to 0 413 12
be 0 413 12
one 0 413 12
state. 0 413 12

Separate 0 413 13
but 0 413 13
equal 0 413 13
does 0 413 13
not 0 413 13
work. 0 413 13

I’m 0 413 14
only 0 413 14
42 0 413 14
years 0 413 14
old 0 413 14
but 0 413 14
my 0 413 14
teachers 0 413 14
were 0 413 14
of 0 413 14
that 0 413 14
generation 0 413 14
that 0 413 14
marched 0 413 14
with 0 413 14
Martin 0 413 14
Luther 0 413 14
King. 0 413 14

This 0 413 15
whole 0 413 15
idea 0 413 15
of 0 413 15
a 0 413 15
two-state 0 413 15
solution, 0 413 15
it 1 413 15
doesn’t 1 413 15
work.” 1 413 15

Indeed 0 413 16
it 0 413 16
doesn’t. 0 413 16

A 0 413 17
Palestinian 0 413 17
state 0 413 17
would 0 413 17
be 0 413 17
a 0 413 17
new 0 413 17
base 0 413 17
for 0 413 17
renewed 0 413 17
jihad 0 413 17
attacks 0 413 17
against 0 413 17
Israel. 0 413 17

But 0 413 18
a 0 413 18
“one-state 0 413 18
solution” 0 413 18
would 0 413 18
be 0 413 18
even 0 413 18
worse, 0 413 18
unless 0 413 18
that 0 413 18
state 0 413 18
is 0 413 18
the 0 413 18
current 0 413 18
State 0 413 18
of 0 413 18
Israel, 0 413 18
but 0 413 18
that 0 413 18
is 0 413 18
not 0 413 18
the 0 413 18
one 0 413 18
state 0 413 18
Tlaib 0 413 18
has 0 413 18
in 0 413 18
mind. 0 413 18

She 0 413 19
is 0 413 19
calling 0 413 19
for 0 413 19
an 0 413 19
Israeli/Palestinian 0 413 19
state 0 413 19
that 0 413 19
would 0 413 19
not 0 413 19
be 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
Jewish 0 413 19
State 0 413 19
or 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
homeland 0 413 19
for 0 413 19
the 0 413 19
Jewish 0 413 19
people, 0 413 19
but 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
federation 0 413 19
in 0 413 19
which 0 413 19
Palestinians 0 413 19
would 0 413 19
soon 0 413 19
overwhelm 0 413 19
Jews 0 413 19
demographically. 0 413 19

Progressive 0 413 20
denial 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
their 0 413 20
rights 0 413 20
would 0 413 20
soon 0 413 20
follow: 0 413 20
as 0 413 20
I 0 413 20
show 0 413 20
in 0 413 20
my 0 413 20
book 0 413 20
The 0 413 20
History 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
Jihad 0 413 20
From 0 413 20
Muhammad 0 413 20
to 0 413 20
ISIS, 0 413 20
there 0 413 20
has 0 413 20
never 0 413 20
been 0 413 20
a 0 413 20
majority 0 413 20
Muslim 0 413 20
nation 0 413 20
in 0 413 20
which 0 413 20
Jews 0 413 20
enjoyed 0 413 20
equality 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
rights 0 413 20
with 0 413 20
Muslims. 0 413 20

Tlaib’s 0 413 21
unitary 0 413 21
state 0 413 21
would 0 413 21
be 0 413 21
no 0 413 21
different. 0 413 21

The 0 413 22
hijabed 0 413 22
(and 0 413 22
therefore 0 413 22
pro-Sharia) 0 413 22
Ilhan 0 413 22
Omar, 0 413 22
meanwhile, 0 413 22
is 1 413 22
even 1 413 22
more 1 413 22
hateful 1 413 22
than 1 413 22
Tlaib. 1 413 22

According 0 413 23
to 0 413 23
the 0 413 23
Daily 0 413 23
Wire, 0 413 23
in 0 413 23
2012 0 413 23
Omar 0 413 23
tweeted: 0 413 23
“Israel 0 413 23

Challenged 0 413 24
about 0 413 24
this 0 413 24
tweet 0 413 24
much 0 413 24
more 0 413 24
recently, 0 413 24
she 1 413 24
doubled 1 413 24
down 1 413 24
and 1 413 24
attacked 1 413 24
the 0 413 24
man 0 413 24
who 0 413 24
called 0 413 24
attention 0 413 24
to 0 413 24
the 0 413 24
tweet: 0 413 24
“Drawing 0 413 24

is 0 413 24
far 0 413 24
from 0 413 24

You 1 413 25
are 1 413 25
a 1 413 25
hateful 1 413 25

man, 1 413 25
I 1 413 25
pray 1 413 25
to 1 413 25
Allah 1 413 25
you 1 413 25
get 1 413 25

There 1 413 26
is 1 413 26
much, 1 413 26
much 1 413 26
worse 1 413 26
about 1 413 26
Omar. 1 413 26

David 0 413 27
Steinberg 0 413 27
of 0 413 27
PJ 0 413 27
Media 0 413 27
has 0 413 27
done 0 413 27
extraordinary 1 413 27
work 1 413 27
in 0 413 27
shedding 0 413 27
light 0 413 27
on 0 413 27
aspects 0 413 27
of 0 413 27
Omar’s 0 413 27
record 0 413 27
that 0 413 27
the 0 413 27
establishment 0 413 27
media 0 413 27
has 0 413 27
steadfastly 1 413 27
ignored. 1 413 27

Steinberg 0 413 28
reports 0 413 28
that 0 413 28
Omar 0 413 28
has 0 413 28
“faced 0 413 28
allegations 0 413 28
-- 0 413 28
soon 0 413 28
backed 0 413 28
by 0 413 28
a 0 413 28
remarkable 0 413 28
amount 0 413 28
of 0 413 28
evidence 0 413 28
-- 0 413 28
that 0 413 28
she 0 413 28
had 0 413 28
married 0 413 28
her 0 413 28
own 0 413 28
brother 0 413 28
in 0 413 28
2009, 0 413 28
and 0 413 28
was 0 413 28
still 0 413 28
legally 0 413 28
his 0 413 28
wife. 0 413 28

They 0 413 29
officially 0 413 29
divorced 0 413 29
in 0 413 29
December 0 413 29
2017. 0 413 29

The 0 413 30
motivation 0 413 30
for 0 413 30
the 0 413 30
marriage 0 413 30
remains 0 413 30
unclear. 0 413 30

However, 0 413 31
the 0 413 31
totality 0 413 31
of 0 413 31
the 0 413 31
evidence 0 413 31
points 0 413 31
to 0 413 31
possible 0 413 31
immigration 0 413 31
fraud 0 413 31
and 0 413 31

What’s 0 413 31
more, 0 413 31
she 0 413 31
swore 0 413 31
to 0 413 31
apparent 0 413 31
falsehoods 0 413 31
in 0 413 31
court. 0 413 31

But 0 413 32
Leftists 0 413 32
rarely 0 413 32
have 0 413 32
to 0 413 32
answer 0 413 32
for 0 413 32
their 0 413 32
corruption, 0 413 32
and 0 413 32
in 0 413 32
a 0 413 32
Democrat 0 413 32
House, 0 413 32
Omar 0 413 32
will 0 413 32
much 0 413 32
more 0 413 32
likely 0 413 32
be 0 413 32
celebrated 0 413 32
than 0 413 32
investigated. 0 413 32

She 0 413 33
and 0 413 33
Tlaib 0 413 33
will 0 413 33
enjoy 0 413 33
establishment 0 413 33
media 0 413 33
accolades 0 413 33
as 0 413 33
they 0 413 33
pursue 0 413 33
their 0 413 33
hard-Left, 0 413 33
anti-American, 0 413 33
anti-Israel 0 413 33
agenda. 0 413 33

Their 0 413 34
presence 0 413 34
in 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
House 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
Representatives 0 413 34
may 0 413 34
be 0 413 34
evidence 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
“diversity,” 0 413 34
but 0 413 34
it 0 413 34
is 0 413 34
also 0 413 34
a 0 413 34
disquieting 0 413 34
sign 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
continued 0 413 34
dominance 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
identity 0 413 34
politics, 0 413 34
and 0 413 34
the 1 413 34
increasing 1 413 34
balkanization 1 413 34
of 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
American 0 413 34
body 0 413 34
politic. 0 413 34

Forthrightly 1 413 35
pro-America, 1 413 35
pro-Israel 1 413 35
candidates 1 413 35
would 1 413 35
stand 1 413 35
little 1 413 35
to 1 413 35
no 1 413 35
chance 1 413 35
in 1 413 35
either 1 413 35
of 1 413 35
their 1 413 35
districts. 1 413 35

And 1 413 35

that 1 413 35

is 1 413 35

indicative 1 413 35

of 1 413 35
