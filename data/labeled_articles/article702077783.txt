BLACKOUT 0

Shooting 0

There 0
already 0
was 0
a 0
blackout 0
on 0
the 0
worst 0
mass 0
murder 0
in 0
modern 0
American 0
history. 0

58 0
dead, 0
hundreds 0
wounded, 0
the 0
savagery 0
of 0
the 0
Vegas 0
attack 0
is 0
unspeakable, 0
and 0
still 1
the 1
incompetent, 1
clueless 1
authorities 1
know 1
nothing. 1

That’s 1
the 1
information 1
they 1
seek 1
to 1
blackout. 1

This 0
botched 1
investigation 1
is 0
a 0
stunning 0
indictment 0
of 0
the 0
FBI. 0

This 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
Soviet 1
Union, 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
Iran 1
or 1
Riyadh 1
– 1
this 1
is 1
America. 1

Where 0
is 0
the 0
outrage? 0

And 0
while 0
the 0
bumbling 1
FBI 1
has 0
dismissed 0
out 0
of 0
hand 0
jihad 0
as 0
a 0
motive, 0
here 0
is 0
what 0
we 0
know: 0

ISIS 0
has 0
claimed 0
responsibility 0
for 0
the 0
Vegas 0
slaughter. 0

ISIS 0
does 0
not 0
claim 0
credit 0
for 0
events 0
that 0
are 0
not 0
theirs. 0

They 0
have 0
double 0
and 0
tripled 0
down 0
on 0
their 0
claim. 0

They 0
have 0
said 0
that 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
had 0
converted 0
to 0
Islam 0
six 0
months 0
ago, 0
and 0
they 0
revealed 0
his 0
Islamic 0
name 0
as 0
Abu 0
Abd 0
Abdulbar 0
al 0
Ameriki. 0

Paddock 0
made 0
multiple 0
trips 0
to 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

The 0
FBI 0
has 0
not 0
spoken 0
of 0
his 0
itinerary 0
or 0
who 0
he 0
met 0
with. 0

His 0
girlfriend 0
Mari 0
Danley 0
had 0

in 0

Over 0
200 0
of 0
Paddock’s 0
foreign 0
financial 0

were 0
flagged 0
for 0
possible 0

Paddock 0
transferred 0
$100,000 0
to 0
his 0
girlfriend 0
in 0
the 0
Philippines, 0
now 0
an 0
ISIS 0
foothold. 0

Paddock 0
removed 0
the 0
hard 0
drive 0
before 0
he 0
committed 0
suicide. 0

The 0
San 0
Bernardino 0
jihad 0
attackers 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing. 0

If 0
you 0
recall, 0
Syed 0

Tashfeen 0

threw 0
their 0

It 0

like 0
this. 0

In 0
the 0
days 0
after 0
Oct. 0
1, 0
when 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
Route 0

Harvest 0
festival 0
crowd 0
from 0
his 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
corner 0
suite, 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
were 0
hosting 0
multiple 0

a 0
day. 0

Then, 0
once 0
a 0
day. 0

Then, 0
once 0
every 0
few 0
days. 0

They 0
compiled 0

They 0

They 0
released 0

which 0

They 0
took 0
it 0
back, 0
and 0
tried 0
to 0
clarify 0
the 0
errors, 0
but 0
instead 0
caused 0
more 0
confusion. 0

By 0
Oct. 0
13 0
— 0
the 0
last 0
time 0
the 0
Metropolitan 0
Police 0
Department 0
or 0
the 0
FBI 0
addressed 0
the 0
media 0
or 0
public 0
— 0
something 0
had 0
changed. 0

The 0
sheriff, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
straightforward 0
and 0
stern, 0
was 0
now 0
emotional 0
and 0
at 0
times 0
combative. 0

Both 0
he 0
and 0
the 0
FBI 0
failed 0
to 0
provide 0
much 0
new 0
information, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
meeting, 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
take 0
questions. 0

Since 0
that 0
day, 0
the 0
only 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
shed 0
more 0
light 0
on 0
the 0
investigation 0
is 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
guard 0
Jesus 0
Campos, 0
who 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
the 0
leg 0
while 0
approaching 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
room. 0

His 0
platform 0
to 0
share 0
that 0
information? 0

“The 0
Ellen 0
DeGeneres 0
Show,” 0
which 0
aired 0
last 0
week. 0

He 0
hasn’t 0
made 0
himself 0
available 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
since. 0

“It 0
doesn’t 0
matter,” 0
FBI 0
spokeswoman 0
Sandra 0
Breault 0
told 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Review-Journal 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
when 0
asked 0
why 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
no 0
significant 0
updates 0
in 0
two 0
weeks. 0

“It’s 0
an 0
ongoing 0
investigation, 0
and 0
unless 0
there’s 0
something 0
to 0
report, 0
there 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
briefing.” 0
Calls 0
to 0
the 0
national 0
FBI 0
office 0
were 0
forwarded 0
back 0
to 0
Breault 0
at 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
office. 0

At 0
least 0
twice 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Review-Journal 0
has 0
asked 0
to 0
speak 0
with 0
Sheriff 0
Joe 0
Lombardo 0
about 0
the 0
shooting 0
investigation. 0

Both 0
times, 0
reporters 0
were 0
told 0
by 0
Carla 0
Alston, 0
the 0
Police 0
Department’s 0
director 0
of 0
communications, 0
that 0
the 0
sheriff 0
“will 0
not 0
be 0
conducting 0
interviews.” 0
“As 0
he 0
has 0
stated 0
previously, 0
the 0
case 0
is 0
still 0
ongoing” 0
she 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
Thursday. 0

“Another 0
media 0
briefing 0
will 0
be 0
held 0
when 0
we 0
have 0
new 0
and 0
accurate 0
information.” 0
When 0
asked 0
when 0
that 0
briefing 0
would 0
be, 0
Alston 0
guessed 0
it 0
could 0
occur 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
two 0
weeks. 0

The 0
Review-Journal 0
also 0
specifically 0
asked 0
about 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
50,000 0
hours 0
of 0
overtime 0
that 0
Metro 0
officers 0
have 0
logged 0
since 0
Oct. 0
1 0
on 0
work 0
directly 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
shooting 0
investigation. 0

“Investigators 0
have 0
made 0
progress 0
on 0
investigative 0
leads 0
and 0
in 0
mapping 0
out 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
life 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
years 0
— 0
and 0
they’re 0
still 0
not 0
done,” 0
Alston 0
said. 0

“We 0
still 0
have 0
officers 0
dedicated 0
to 0
this 0
case 0
24/7.” 0
She 0
agreed 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
public 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
more, 0
“but 0
they 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
accurate 0
information 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
speculation 0
… 0
that 0
has 0
filled 0
so 0
many 0
news 0
stories 0
the 0
past 0
month.” 0
Nearly 0
a 0
month 0
after 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting, 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
motive 0
remains 0
a 0
mystery. 0

More 0
straightforward 0
questions 0
also 0
remain 0
unanswered, 0
including 0
whether 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
of 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
— 0
where 0
the 0
gunman 0
was 0
staying 0
— 0
has 0
surveillance 0
cameras, 0
and 0
what 0
exactly 0
investigators 0
collected 0
in 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
hotel 0
room 0
and 0
homes. 0

Authorities 0
also 0
have 0
not 0
said 0
how 0
long 0
the 0
gunman 0
had 0
a 0
“do 0
not 0
disturb” 0
sign 0
on 0
his 0
hotel 0
door, 0
and 0
whether 0
hotel 0
staff 0
saw 0
something 0
suspicious 0
in 0
his 0
room 0
but 0
failed 0
to 0
report 0
it. 0

Though 0
authorities 0
have 0
described 0
the 0
investigation 0
as 0
a 0
team 0
effort, 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
explained 0
what 0
role 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police, 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Alcohol, 0
Tobacco, 0
Firearms 0
and 0
Explosives 0
are 0
playing 0
in 0
the 0
