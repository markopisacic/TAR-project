Neo-Catholics 1
Panic 1

In 0
his 0
eleven-page 0
account, 0
affirmed 0
under 0
oath, 0
the 0
Archbishop, 0
marking 0
a 0
turning 0
point 0
in 0
Church 0
history, 0
declares 0
that 0
senior 0
Vatican 0
officials, 0
including 0
former 0
Secretaries 0
of 0
State 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
Óscar 0
Andrés 0
Rodríguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
coordinator 0
of 0
Pope 0
Bergoglio’s 0
“Council 0
of 0
Cardinals”, 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
decades 0
of 0
sexual 0
predation 0
and 0
that 0
Bergoglio 0
himself 0
continued 0
the 0
coverup. 0

This 0
article 0
was 0
first 0
written 0
to 0
address 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentator 0
Massimo 0
Faggioli’s 0
attempt 0
, 0
following 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
and 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
ex-Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
to 0
minimize 0
the 0
homosexual 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
blunt 0
the 0
correlative 0
rise 0
of 0
what 0
he 0
derides 0
as 0
“neo-traditionalism.” 0
As 0
my 0
piece 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
press, 0
however, 0
EWTN’s 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register 0
broke 0
the 1
explosive 1
story 1
on 0
the 0
written 0
testimony 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Viganò 0
, 0
former 0
apostolic 0
nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
(2011 0
to 0
2016). 0

Faggioli’s 0
propaganda 0
piece 0
now 0
becomes 0
merely 0
illustrative 0
of 0
the 0
points 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
here 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
this 0
astonishing 1
and 1
indeed 1
providential 1
development. 1

Regarding 0
Bergoglio, 0
Viganò 0
testifies 0
that 0
in 0
2013 0
he 0
personally 0
informed 0
him 0
about 0
McCarrick’s 0
history, 0
the 0
dossier 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
on 0
his 0
sexual 0
crimes 0
against 0
boys 0
and 0
young 0
men, 0
and 0
the 0
disciplinary 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
upon 0
him 0
by 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
(forbidding 0
residence 0
in 0
a 0
seminary, 0
public 0
appearances 0
and 0
Masses). 0

Evidently 0
already 0
aware 0
of 0
these 0
facts, 0
however, 0
Bergoglio 0
not 0
only 0
rehabilitated 0
McCarrick 0
but 0
made 0
him 0
a 0
“trusted 0
counselor” 0
who 0
advised 0
the 0
elevation 0
of 0
the 0
pro-homosexual 0
prelates 0
Blase 0
Cupich, 0
Joseph 0
Tobin 0
and 0
Kevin 0
Farrell 0
to 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
prominent 0
episcopal 0
sees 0
they 0
now 0
discredit. 0

All 0
of 0
this 0
happened 0
before 0
Bergoglio, 0
bowing 0
to 0
worldwide 0
public 0
pressure, 0
finally—only 0
weeks 0
ago—took 0
decisive 0
action 0
against 0
his 0
“trusted 1
counselor.” 1
McCarrick 0
had 0
lobbied 0
for 0
Bergoglio’s 0
election, 0
along 0
with 0
Maradiaga 0
and 0
the 1
infamous 1
Cardinal 1
Danneels, 0
who 1
covered 1
up 1
homosexual 1
rape 1
committed 1
by 1
a 1
priest 1
against 1
his 1
own 1
nephew,has 1
supported 1
“same-sex 1
marriage,” 1
and 1
advised 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Belgium 1
to 1
sign 1
a 1
law 1
legalizing 1
abortion 1
in 1
1990. 1

As 1
Edward 1
Pentin 1
notes: 1
“all 1
3 1
prelates 1
have 1
since 1
been 1
special 1
advisors 1
of 1
Francis 1
or 1
rehabilitated 1
by 1
him.” 1

Viganò 0
concludes 0
his 0
testimony 0
by 0
declaring 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
prelates 0
involved 0
(many 0
others 0
are 0
implicated), 0
including 0
Bergoglio, 0
should 0
resign 0
their 0
offices 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

As 0
to 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
particular, 0
he 0
courageously 0
states 0
openly 0
the 0
truth 0
that 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
his 0
brethren 0
know 0
but 0
fear 0
to 0
speak 0
in 0
public: 0

I 0
want 0
to 0
recall 0
this 1
indefectible 1
truth 1
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
holiness 0
to 0
the 0
many 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
so 0
deeply 1
scandalized 1
by 1
the 1
abominable 1
and 1
sacrilegious 1
behavior 1
of 0
the 0
former 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington, 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick; 0
by 0
the 1
grave, 1
disconcerting 1
and 1
sinful 1
conduct 1
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
of 0
so 0
many 0
pastors, 0
and 0
who 0
are 0
tempted 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Church, 0
disfigured 1
by 1
so 1
many 1
ignominies. 1

At 0
the 0
Angelus 0
on 0
Sunday, 0
August 0
12, 0
2018 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
said 0
these 0
words: 0
“Everyone 1
is 1
guilty 1
for 1
the 1
good 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
... 1

If 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
oppose 1
evil, 1
we 1
tacitly 1
feed 1
it. 1

We 0
need 0
to 0
intervene 0
where 0
evil 0
is 0
spreading; 0
for 0
evil 0
spreads 0
where 0
daring 0
Christians 0
who 0
oppose 0
evil 0
with 0
good 0
are 0
lacking.” 0
[emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0
If 0
this 0
is 0
rightly 0
to 0
be 0
considered 0
a 0
serious 0
moral 0
responsibility 0
for 0
every 0
believer, 0
how 0
much 0
graver 0
is 0
it 0
for 0
the 1
Church’s 1
supreme 1
pastor, 1
who 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
McCarrick 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
not 1
oppose 1
evil 1
but 1
associated 1
himself 1
in 1
doing 1
evil 1
with 1
someone 1
he 1
knew 1
to 1
be 1
deeply 1
corrupt. 1

He 0
followed 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
someone 1
he 1
knew 1
well 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pervert, 1
thus 0
multiplying 0
exponentially 0
with 0
his 0
supreme 0
authority 0
the 0
evil 0
done 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

And 0
how 0
many 0
other 0
evil 1
pastors 1
is 0
Francis 0
still 0
continuing 0
to 0
prop 0
up 0
in 0
their 1
active 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
Church! 1

[my 0
emphasis] 0
Francis 0
is 0
abdicating 0
the 0
mandate 0
which 0
Christ 0
gave 0
to 0
Peter 0
to 0
confirm 0
the 0
brethren. 0

Indeed, 0
by 0
his 0
action 0
he 0
has 0
divided 0
them, 0
led 0
them 0
into 0
error, 0
and 0
encouraged 1
the 1
wolves 1
to 1
continue 1
to 1
tear 1
apart 1
the 1
sheep 1
of 0
Christ’s 0
flock. 0

In 0
this 0
extremely 1
dramatic 1
moment 1
for 0
the 0
universal 0
Church, 0
he 0
must 0
acknowledge 0
his 0
mistakes 0
and, 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
the 0
proclaimed 0
principle 0
of 0
zero 0
tolerance, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
must 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
set 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
for 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops 0
who 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses 0
and 0
resign 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

[emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0

Before 0
he 0
was 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
in 0
Washington, 0
Viganò 0
headed 0
the 0
Governorate 0
of 0
Vatican 0
City 0
State 0
after 0
having 0
served 0
as 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Nigeria, 0
a 0
Delegate 0
for 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Representatives 0
of 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
and 0
a 0
Member 0
of 0
the 0
Disciplinary 0
Commission 0
of 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia. 0

In 0
those 0
capacities 0
he 0
had 0
access 0
to 0
documents 0
and 0
witnesses 0
that 0
corroborate 0
his 0
own 0
firsthand 0
testimony. 0

With 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony, 0
the 0
widespread 0
homosexual 0
infiltration 0
of 0
the 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
hierarchy, 0
from 0
the 0
top 0
on 0
down, 0
now 0
emerges 1
mountainously 1
into 1
view, 1
never 1
to 1
be 1
buried 1
again. 1

Even 0
before 0
that 0
testimony, 0
however, 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
had 0
already 0
presented 0
a 1
Sisyphean 1
task 1
to 0
neo-Catholic 1
apologists 1
for 0
the 0
decrepit 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
status 0
quo 0
and 0
the 0
ill-starred 0
Council 0
that 0
launched 0
its 0
installation. 0

Yet 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
doubt 1
they 1
will 1
continue 1
the 1
same 1
polemic 1
that 1
for 1
nearly 1
sixty 1
years 1
has 1
doggedly 1
defended 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
ruinous 1
“reforms” 1
that 1
have 1
resulted 1
in 1
a 1
debacle 1
without 1
equal 1
in 1
Church 1
history, 1
even 0
considering 0
the 0
Arian 0
crisis 0
of 0
the 0
4th 0
century. 0

Those 0
“reforms” 0
included 0
abandonment 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
strict 0
pre-conciliar 0
instruction 0
(1961) 0
that 0
“advancement 1
to 1
religious 1
vows 1
and 1
ordination 1
should 1
be 1
barred 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
afflicted 1
with 1
evil 1
tendencies 1
to 1
homosexuality 1
or 1
pederasty, 1
since 1
for 1
them 1
the 1
common 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
priestly 1
ministry 1
would 1
constitute 1
serious 1
dangers.” 1
Today, 1
neo-Catholic 1
commentators, 1
cowed 1
by 1
the 1
demands 1
of 1
political 1
correctness, 1
refuse 1
to 1
state 1
the 1
simple 1
truth 1
that 1
homosexuality 1
is 1
a 1
perversion 1
that 1
precludes 1
ordination 1
as 1
does 1
any 1
other 1
grave 1
psychological 1
disorder. 1

Kill 1
the 1
Messenger 1

I 0
suspect 0
that 0
not 0
even 0
Viganò’s 0
historic 0
testimony 0
will 0
change 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 1
position. 0

Quite 0
the 0
contrary, 0
I 0
would 0
expect 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentariat 0
either 0
to 0
ignore 0
Viganò’s 0
witness, 0
explain 0
away 0
his 0
revelations 0
or, 0
failing 0
that, 0
make 0
every 0
effort 0
to 1
smear 1
the 1
man. 1

The 0
campaign 0
to 0
discredit 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
began 0
instantaneously 0
on 0
the 0
Catholic 0
left 0
wing. 0

Only 0
hours 0
after 0
Viganò’s 0
sworn 0
testimony 0
appeared 0
online, 0
the 1
professional 1
Catholic 1
dissident 1
Sean 0
Michael 0
Winters, 0
writing 0
for 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter, 0
smeared 1
the 0
former 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
who 0
holds 0
doctorates 0
in 0
both 0
civil 0
and 0
canon 0
law, 0
as 0
“a 0
trafficker 1
in 1
conspiracy 1
theories 1
who 1
mixes 1
fact, 1
fiction 1
and 1
venom,” 1
“more 1
than 1
a 1
little 1
obsessed 1
with 1
homosexuality”—like 1
Oliver 0
Stone, 0
who 0
“was 0
obsessed 0
with 0
the 0
grassy 0
knoll”—“a 0
disgruntled 1
former 1
employee” 1
and 1
“always 1
a 1
crackpot.” 1
Without 0
addressing 0
the 0
merits, 0
Winters 0
dismissed 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
“wild 1
claims” 1
about 0
bishops 0
who 0
are 0
“subverting 0
Catholic 0
doctrine 0
on 0
homosexuality” 0
and 0
accused 0
the 0
Archbishop, 0
along 0
with 0
unnamed 0
other 0
bishops 0
and 0
archbishops, 0
of 0
“speak[ing] 0
about 0
gay 0
people 0
with 0
such 0
hatred…” 0

Winters 0
issues 0
the 0
dire 0
warning 0
that 0
“A 0
putsch 1
is 1
afoot 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
U.S. 1
bishops 1
do 1
not, 1
as 1
a 1
body, 1
stand 1
up 1
to 1
defend 1
the 1
Holy 1
Father 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
24 1
hours, 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
slipping 1
towards 1
schism 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
bishops’ 1
meeting 0
in 0
November. 0

The 0
enemies 0
of 0
Francis 0
have 0
declared 0
war.” 0
Notice 0
that 0
for 1
Winters 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
Church 1
or 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
her 1
doctrine 1
and 1
discipline 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
defended 1
against 1
enemies, 1
but 1
only 1
Bergoglio 1
and 1
the 1
regime 1
of 1
novelty 1
he 1
is 1
leading 1
to 1
its 1
final 1
extremity. 1

John 0
Allen’s 0
instant 0
analysis 0
attempting 0
to 0
impeach 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
is, 0
as 0
one 0
would 0
expect 0
from 0
him, 0
a 0
bit 0
craftier. 0

His 0
opinion 0
is: 0
“Take 1
it 1
seriously, 1
but 1
with 1
a 1
large 1
grain 1
of 1
salt.” 1
Which 1
is 1
just 1
Allen’s 1
more 1
nuanced 1
way 1
of 1
saying: 1
“Don’t 1
believe 1
it.” 1
Allen’s 0
view 0
is 0
supported 0
by 0
such 0
irrelevancies 0
as 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Viganò’s 0
account 0
implicates 0
“no 0
fewer 0
than 0
32 0
senior 0
churchmen” 0
(so 0
what? 0

), 0
that 0
he 1
“has 1
a 1
history” 1
of 1
“innuendo 1
and 1
conspiracy 1
theories” 1
(a 0
gratuitous 0
assertion 0
unsupported 0
by 0
evidence 0
of 0
falsity), 0
that 0
he 0
allegedly 1
quashed 1
an 0
investigation 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
John 0
Nienstedt 0
and 0
ordered 0
evidence 0
destroyed 0
(an 0
allegation 0
Viganò 0
has 0
immediately 0
and 0
categorically 0
denied 0
with 0
conclusive 0
supporting 0
documents, 0
but 0
in 0
any 0
event 0
a 0
tuo 0
quoque 0
fallacy) 0
and 0
that 0
Allen 0
has 0
“the 0
impression 0
that 0
all 0
this 0
was 0
orchestrated 0
with 0
a 0
political 0
agenda 0
in 0
mind” 0
(the 0
same 0
“conspiracy 0
theory” 0
mentality 0
he 0
gratuitously 0
attributes 0
to 0
Viganò). 0

Mark 0
Shea, 0
easily 0
the 1
most 1
insufferable 1
of 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
polemicists, 1
has 0
quickly 0
followed 0
Winters 0
and 0
Allen 0
in 0
trying 0
to 0
cast 0
doubt 0
on 0
Viganò 0
’s 0
claims. 0

Ignoring 1
eleven 1
pages 1
of 1
detail, 1
written 1
and 1
published 1
under 1
oath, 1
he 1
suggests 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
“Documentation. 1

Evidence. 0

Proof.” 0
Yes, 0
Francis 0
should 0
resign 0
if 0
Viganò 0
’s 0
allegations 0
are 0
true, 0
Shea 0
admits—a 0
stunning 1
concession 1
coming 1
from 1
him. 1

Yet, 0
making 0
no 0
attempt 0
to 0
refute 0
Viganò’s 0
account 0
on 0
the 0
merits, 0
he 0
tries 0
to 0
wave 0
it 0
all 0
aside 0
with 0
his 0
usual 0
mode 0
of 0
argument—puerile 0
mockery: 1
“But 0
at 0
present, 0
the 0
eagerness 0
of 0
the 1
Greatest 1
Catholics 1
of 1
All 1
Time 1
to 0
believe 0
and 0
repeat 0
everything 0
their 1
itching 1
ears 1
want 1
to 1
hear 1
about 0
this 0
Pope 0
whose 1
living 1
guts 1
they 1
have 1
hated 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
election 1
only 0
tells 0
in 0
his 0
favor, 0
not 0
against 0
it.” 0
Shea’s 0
ever-expanding 0
opus 0
of 0
digital 0
invective 0
never 0
seems 0
to 0
rise 0
above 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
crude 0
ad 0

attack: 0
Well, 0
if 1
those 1
people 1
believe 1

that 1
“Viganò 1

the 1
truth. 1

integrity 1
and 1
sincere 1
love 1

Church."] 1

In 0
another 0
setback 0
for 0
the 1
propaganda 1
machine 1
gearing 1
up 1
to 1
impeach 1
Viganò’s 1
testimony, 1
the 0
Catholic 0
Herald 0
has 0
just 0
reported 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
must 0
have 0
known 0
full 0
well 0
from 0
Viganò 0
himself 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
under 0
Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
papal 0
sanctions 0
on 0
account 0
of 0
his 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
because, 0
as 0
an 0
Archdiocesan 0
spokesman 0
now 0
confirms, 0
at 0
Viganò’s 0
request 0
as 0
then 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
Wuerl 0
had 0
to 0
cancel 0
a 0
public 0
appearance 0
by 0
McCarrick 0
not 0
long 0
before 0
Bergoglio’s 0
election. 0

The 0
Herald 0
asks 0
the 0
obvious 0
question: 0
“[I]f 1
Cardinal 1
Wuerl 1
was 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
sanctions, 1
and 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
them, 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
ask 1
no 1
questions 1
of 1
the 1
nuncio 1
regarding 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
his 1
demand?” 1
The 0
question 0
answers 0
itself, 0
and 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
on 0
this 0
critical 0
point 0
stands 0
confirmed 0
by 0
Wuerl’s 0
own 0
spokesman. 0

Bergoglio 0
Pleads 0
the 0
Fifth 0

Bergoglio 0
himself, 0
however, 0
has 0
already 0
precluded 0
any 0
attempt 0
to 0
impeach 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony. 0

During 0
the 0
return 0
flight 0
from 0
Dublin 0
after 0
the 0
“World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Familes,” 0
he 0
was 0
asked 0
to 0
comment 0
on 0
Viganò 0
’s 0
allegations 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
informed 0
Bergoglio 0
of 0
McCarrick’s 0
crimes 0
in 0
2013 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
Benedict. 0

Bergoglio 0
declined 0
to 0
incriminate 0
himself: 0

Read 0
the 0
statement 0
carefully 0
yourselves 0
and 0
make 0
your 0
own 0
judgment. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
say 0
a 0
word 0
about 0
this. 0

I 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
statement 0
speaks 0
for 0
itself, 0
and 0
you 0
all 0
have 0
sufficient 0
journalistic 0
ability 0
to 0
draw 0
conclusions. 0

It 0
is 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
trust. 0

When 0
a 0
little 0
time 0
goes 0
by, 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
drawn 0
conclusions, 0
perhaps 0
I 0
will 0
speak 0
about 0
it, 0
but 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
your 0
professional 0
maturity 0
to 0
do 0
this 0
work. 0

It 0
will 0
do 0
you 0
all 0
good, 0
really. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
as 1
Bergoglio 1
cannot 1
deny 1
the 1
allegations 1
without 1
lying, 1
he 1
will 1
say 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
about 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
they 1
will 1
go 1
away—with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
sycophants 1
in 1
the 1
Vatican 1
press 1
corps 1
and 1
shifty 1
polemicists 1
like 0
Shea, 0
who 0
expects 1
his 1
readers 1
to 1
swallow 1
his 1
explanation 1
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
refusal 0
to 0
say 0
anything 0
in 0
his 0
defense 0
when 0
asked 0
point 0
blank 0
about 0
the 0
charges 0
against 0
him 0
“seems 0
to 0
me 0
to 0
obviously 0
be 0
the 0
reply 0
of 0
somebody 0
who 0
believes 0
the 0
accusations 0
are 0
groundless…”. 0

Seems 0
to 0
be. 0

Obviously. 0

While 0
events 0
have 0
overtaken 0
Faggioli’s 0
piece, 0
it 0
will 0
remain 0
useful 0
here 0
as 0
a 0
prime 0
example 0
of 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
polemic. 0

That 0
polemic 0
seeks 0
to 0
shore 0
up 0
the 0
collapsing 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
establishment 0
lest 0
it 0
give 0
way 0
to 0
the 1
dreaded 1
traditionalist 1
revival. 1

But 0
before 0
I 0
address 0
Faggioli’s 0
latest 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
indefensible, 0
some 0
background 0
is 0
in 0
order, 0
including 0
a 0
discussion 0
of 0
further 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony. 0

First 0
of 0
all, 0
as 0
I 0
predicted 0
16 0
years 0
ago, 0
because 0
the 0
Vatican 0
under 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
had 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
enforcing 0
the 0
pre-conciliar 0
ban 0
on 0
admission 0
of 0
homosexuals 0
to 0
the 0
seminary 0
“a 0
new 1
bumper 1
crop 1
of 1
homosexual 1
ordinands 1
is 0
guaranteed—and 0
with 0
it 0
a 1
new 1
harvest 1
of 1
scandal 1
for 1
the 1
Church.” 1
That 0
prediction 0
came 0
immediately 0
after 0
the 1
“pedophile 1
summit” 1
of 1
2002 1
in 1
Rome, 1
which 0
I 0
attended 0
as 0
The 0
Remnant’s 0
correspondent. 0

In 0
answer 0
to 0
my 0
question 0
then 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
Wilton 0
Gregory, 0
made 0
an 1
explosive 1
admission 1
reportedby 0
the 0
international 0
press: 0
“it 0
is 0
an 0
ongoing 0
struggle 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
Catholic 0
priesthood 0
is 0
not 0
dominated 0
by 0
homosexual 0
men.” 0
The 1
struggle, 1
to 1
the 1
extent 1
there 1
even 1
was 1
one, 1
obviously 1
has 1
been 1
lost. 1

Sixteen 0
years 0
later, 0
the 1
homosexual 1
predator 1
McCarrick 0
has 0
finally 0
been 0
exposed 0
to 0
the 0
world, 0
stripped 0
of 0
his 0
cardinal’s 0
hat 0
and 0
deprived 0
of 0
any 0
ministry, 0
but 0
only 0
after 0
international 0
media 0
coverage 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
semi-secret 0
finding 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
raped 0
a 0
teenage 0
altar 0
boy 0
47 0
years 0
ago. 0

If 0
not 0
for 0
that 0
one 0
case, 0
McCarrick’s 0
sixty 0
years 0
of 0
homosexual 1
debauchery 1
might 0
well 0
have 0
gone 0
unpunished 0
in 0
this 0
world 0
and 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
died 0
still 0
possessed 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
phony 1
honors 1
that 0
had 0
been 0
heaped 0
upon 0
him 0
throughout 0
his 0
career 0
as 0
a 1
parasite 1
in 1
the 1
Body 1
of 1
Christ, 1
including 0
the 0
favor 0
shown 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
Bergoglio. 0

The 0
telling 0
details 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
concerning 0
Bergoglio’s 0
friendly 0
relations 0
with 0
McCarrick 0
before 0
he 0
finally 0
had 0
to 0
cut 0
him 0
loose—details 1
conveniently 1
ignored 1
by 1
Winters, 1
Allen 1
and 1
Shea—are 1
utterly 1
devastating 1
to 0
any 0
defense 0
of 0
Bergoglio. 0

This 0
would 0
explain 0
why 0
he 0
will 0
not 0
a 0
“say 0
a 0
word 0
about” 0
Viganò’s 0
charges 0
against 0
him. 0

The 0
Archbishop 0
reveals, 0
as 0
already 0
noted, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
imposed 0
sanctions 0
on 0
McCarrick 0
under 0
which 0
he 0
“was 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
seminary 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
living, 0
he 0
was 0
forbidden 0
to 0
celebrate 0
[Mass] 0
in 0
public, 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
public 0
meetings, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures, 0
to 0
travel, 0
with 0
the 0
obligation 0
of 0
dedicating 0
himself 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance.” 0
Viganò 0
further 0
reveals 0
that 0
those 0
sanctions 0
were 0
communicated 0
to 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
then 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Pietro 0
Sambi, 0
but 0
were 0
also 0
repeated 0
by 0
Viganò 0
himself 0
when 0
he 0
succeeded 0
Sambi 0
as 0
Nuncio: 0

I 0
repeated 0
them 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
at 0
my 0
first 0
meeting 0
with 0
him 0
at 0
the 0
Nunciature. 0

The 0
Cardinal, 0
muttering 1
in 1
a 1
barely 1
comprehensible 1
way, 1
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
perhaps 1
made 1
the 1
mistake 1
of 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
bed 1
with 1
some 1
seminarians 1
at 1
his 1
beach 1
house, 1
but 0
he 0
said 0
this 0
as 0
if 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
importance. 0

Viganò 0
testifies 0
that 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013, 0
he 0
obtained 0
a 0
private 0
audience 0
with 0
Bergoglio 0
after 0
having 0
encountered 0
McCarrick 0
at 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
residence 0
three 0
days 0
earlier, 0
during 0
which 0
encounter 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
told 0
him 0
with 0
an 0
air 0
of 0
triumph: 0
“The 0
Pope 0
received 0
me 0
yesterday, 0
tomorrow 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
China” 0
(evidently 0
to 0
assist 0
in 0
negotiating 0
Bergoglio’s 0
planned 1
sellout 1
of 0
China’s 1
underground 1
Catholics 1
to 0
the 0
Communist 1
dictators 1
of 1
Beijing). 1

Viganò 0
wanted 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
apparently 0
been 0
relieved 0
of 0
the 0
sanctions. 0

During 0
the 0
audience 0
Bergoglio 0
queried: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
and 0
Viganò 0
replied 0
with 0
the 0
truth 0
Bergoglio 0
obviously 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
hear: 0

I 0
answered 0
him 0
with 0
complete 0
frankness 0
and, 0
if 0
you 0
want, 0
with 0
great 0
naiveté: 0
“Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
you 0
know 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick, 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
ask 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
dossier 0
this 0
thick 0
about 0
him. 0

He 0
corrupted 0
generations 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests 0
and 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
ordered 0
him 0
to 0
withdraw 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance.” 0
The 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
the 0
slightest 0
comment 0
about 0
those 0
very 1
grave 1
words 1
of 1
mine 1
and 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
any 0
expression 0
of 0
surprise 0
on 0
his 0
face, 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
known 0
the 0
matter 0
for 0
some 0
time, 0
and 0
he 0
immediately 0
changed 0
the 0
subject. 0

But 0
then, 0
what 0
was 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
purpose 0
in 0
asking 0
me 0
that 0
question: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
He 1
clearly 1
wanted 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
an 1
ally 1
of 1
McCarrick 1
or 1
not…. 1

It 0
was 0
also 0
clear 0
that, 0
from 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
election, 0
McCarrick, 0
now 0
free 0
from 0
all 0
constraints, 0
had 0
felt 0
free 0
to 0
travel 0
continuously, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures 0
and 0
interviews…. 0

He 0
[Bergoglio] 0
knew 0
from 0
at 0
least 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
[the 0
date 0
of 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
Viganò] 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
a 1
serial 1
predator. 1

Although 0
he 0
knew 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
corrupt 1
man, 1
he 0
covered 0
for 0
him 0
to 1
the 1
bitter 1
end; 1
indeed, 0
he 0
made 0
McCarrick’s 0
advice 0
his 0
own, 0
which 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
inspired 0
by 0
sound 0
intentions 0
and 0
for 0
love 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

It 0
was 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
report 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
a 0
minor, 0
again 0
on 0
the 0
basis 0
of 0
media 0
attention, 0
that 0
he 0
took 0
action 0
to 0
save 0
his 0
image 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

[all 0
emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0

Before 0
his 0
long 0
overdue 0
fall 0
McCarrick, 0
as 0
Bergoglio’s 1
“trusted 1
counselor,” 1
had 0
been 0
instrumental 0
in 0
cementing 0
into 0
place 0
the 0
homosexual-friendly 0
status 0
quo 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
episcopate 0
that 0
oppresses 0
and 0
defrauds 0
the 0
faithful. 0

It 0
was 0
McCarrick, 0
noted 0
Marco 0
Tosatti, 0
who 0
was 0
behind 0
the 0
elevation 0
of 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
to 0
the 0
key 0
position 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Chicago, 0
where 0
Cupich 0
has 0
since 0
promoted 0
the 0
homosexual 0
subversion 0
of 0
Father 0
James 0
Martin. 0

And 0
Viganò 0
now 0
confirms 0
Tosatti’s 0
allegation: 0
“The 0
appointments 0
of 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
to 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Joseph 0
W. 0
Tobin 0
to 0
Newark 0
were 0
orchestrated 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
Maradiaga 0
and 0
Wuerl, 0
united 1
by 1
a 1
wicked 1
pact 1
of 1
abuses 1
by 1
the 1
first, 1
and 1
at 1
least 1
of 1
coverup 1
of 1
abuses 1
by 1
the 1
other 1
two. 1

Their 0
names 0
were 0
not 0
among 0
those 0
presented 0
by 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
for 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Newark.” 0
That 0
is, 0
the 0
normal 0
process 0
was 0
circumvented 0
for 0
these 0
appointments. 0

Remnant 0
readers 0
may 0
recall 0
that 0
I 0
spotted 0
Cupich 0
back 0
in 0
2002, 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
the 1
obscure 1
Bishop 1
of 1
Rapid 1
City, 1
South 0
Dakota, 0
as 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
what 0
was 0
coming 0
in 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo: 0
accelerated 1
degeneration. 1

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
back 0
then, 0
with 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
Cupich 0
in 0
view: 0

Cupich 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
model 0
of 0
a 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
bishop. 0

He 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
exemplar 1
of 1
the 1
crisis 1
we 1
must 1
still 1
endure…. 1

Let 0
the 0
thing 0
die 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
excesses, 0
for 0
as 0
the 0
“little 0
synod” 0
[the 1
2002 1
“pedophile 1
summit”] 1
demonstrates, 0
the 1
men 1
who 1
control 1
this 1
establishment 1
will 1
never 1
restore 1
it 1
to 1
anything 1
resembling 1
the 1
vibrant 1
Church 1
that 1
a 1
long 1
line 1
of 1
militant, 1
uncompromising 1
Popes 1
delivered 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
at 1
Vatican 1
II. 1

For 1
heaven’s 1
sake, 1
the 0
men 0
who 0
govern 0
the 0
Church 0
today 0
require 0
a 0
Vatican 0
summit 0
meeting 0
to 0
agonize 1
over 1
whether 0
serial 1
child 1
molesters 1
should 0
be 0
defrocked. 0

From 0
the 0
Vatican 0
on 0
down, 0
through 0
deliberate 0
decisions 0
and 0
criminal 0
neglect, 0
the 1
servitors 1
of 1
Vatican 1
II 1
have 1
laid 1
waste 1
to 0
the 0
liturgy, 0
the 0
perennial 0
clarity 0
of 0
Catholic 0
teaching, 0
the 0
Church’s 0
militant 0
opposition 0
to 0
worldly 0
thinking, 0
the 0
traditional 0
formation 0
in 0
seminaries, 0
the 0
religious 0
orders, 0
the 0
missions, 0
the 0
trust 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
priests—in 0
short, 0
the 0
very 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
Church—and 0
dare 0
to 0
call 0
it 0
a 0
renewal. 0

We 1
must 1
no 1
longer 1
subsidize 1
the 1
malpractice 1
of 1
the 1
architects 1
of 1
ruin. 1

Nor 1
must 1
we 1
join 1
the 1
neo-Catholics 1
in 1
their 1
mindless 1
applause 1
when 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
incompetents 1
attempts 1
to 1
repoint 1
a 1
brick 1
or 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
crumbling 1
façade 1
they 1
have 1
erected 1
to 1
obscure 1
the 1
Church 1
of 1
old. 1

As 0
for 0
William 1
(“nighty-night 1
baby!”) 1
Tobin, 1
after 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
arranged 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
become 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Newark, 0
Tobin, 0
another 1
episcopal 1
booster 1
of 1
Martin’s 1
pro-homosexual 1
propaganda, 1
promptly 0
sponsored 0
a 0
“gay 0
pilgrimage” 0
to 0
his 0
cathedral 0
in 0
Newark. 0

And 0
it 0
was 0
McCarrick 0
who 0
obtained 0
the 0
cardinal’s 0
hat 0
for 0
his 0
roommate 0
of 0
six 0
years, 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
whom 0
he 0
consecrated 0
a 0
bishop. 0

Farrell, 0
yet 1
another 1
promoter 1
of 1
Martin’s 1
homosexual 1
activism, 1
arranged 0
for 0
Martin 0
to 0
“welcome 0
‘gay’ 0
families” 0
at 0
the 0
“World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Families” 0
in 0
Dublin 0
from 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
just 0
returned. 0

Finally, 0
there 0
is 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
the 0
“pro-gay” 1
Robert 1
McElroy 1
as 0
Bishop 0
of 0
San 0
Diego, 0
concerning 0
which 0
Viganò 0
reveals: 0
“The 0
appointment 0
of 0
McElroy 0
in 0
San 0
Diego 0
was 0
also 0
orchestrated 0
from 0
above, 0
with 0
an 0
encrypted 0
peremptory 0
order 0
to 0
me 0
as 0
Nuncio, 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin: 0
‘Reserve 0
the 0
See 0
of 0
San 0
Diego 0
for 0
McElroy.’ 0
McElroy 0
was 0
also 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses, 0
as 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
from 0
a 0
letter 0
sent 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
Richard 0
Sipe 0
on 0
July 0
28, 0
2016.” 0
Like 0
Cupich, 0
Tobin 0
and 0
Farrell, 0
McElroy 0
is 0
an 1
avid 1
promoter 1
of 1
Martin’s 1
homosexual 1
subversion 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
calling 0
opposition 0
to 0
Martin 0
symptomatic 0
of 0
a 0
“cancer 1
of 1
vilification 1
[that] 0
is 0
seeping 0
into 0
the 0
institutional 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
church.” 0

Emboldened 0
by 0
the 0
certainty 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
face 0
no 0
discipline 0
whatsoever, 0
Martin, 0
now 0
backed 0
by 0
“Cupich, 0
Tobin, 0
Farrell 0
and 0
McElroy,” 0
as 0
Viganò 0
testifies, 0
is 0
urging 0
all 0
the 0
“gay 0
priests” 0
to 0
“come 0
out,” 0
including 0
those 0
ordained 0
since 0
the 0
useless 0
“pedophile 1
summit” 1
presided 0
over 0
by 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
McCarrick 0
as 0
the 1
classic 1
fox 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
hen 1
house. 1

But 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
also 0
lent 0
his 0
own 0
authority 0
to 0
Martin’s 0
effort 0
to 0
mainstream 0
homosexuality 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

As 0
Viganò 0
notes, 0
it 0
was 0
Bergoglio 0
who 0
made 0
Martin 0
a 0
“Consultor 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
for 0
Communications,” 0
even 0
though 0
he 0
is 0
a 1
“well-known 1
activist 1
who 1
promotes 1
the 1
LGBT 1
agenda, 1
chosen 1
to 1
corrupt 1
the 1
young 1
people 1
who 1
will 1
soon 1
gather 1
in 1
Dublin 1
for 1
the 1
World 1
Meeting 1
of 1
Families…” 1

“Father” 0
Martin 0
now 0
confidently 0
declares, 0
sixteen 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
“pedophile 1
summit,” 1
that 0
“The 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
purge 1
of 1
gay 1
priests 1
is 1
both 1
ridiculous 1
and 1
dangerous. 1

Any 1
purge 1
would 1
empty 1
parishes 1
and 1
religious 1
orders 1
of 1
the 1
thousands 1
of 1
priests 1
and 1
bishops 1
who 1
lead 1
healthy 1
lives 1
of 1
service 1
and 1
faithful 1
lives 1
of 1
celibacy.” 1

Martin 0
thus 0
revels 1
in 1
smug 1
certitude 1
that 0
the 0
future 0
of 0
the 0
universal 0
Church 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
legions 1
of 1
intrinsically 1
disordered 1
homosexual 1
bishops 1
and 1
priests 1
and 0
their 0
homosexual 0
successors, 0
who 0
will 0
perpetuate 0
an 0
existing 0
worldwide 0
homosexual 0
network, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
absolutely 0
nothing 0
we 0
can 0
or 0
should 0
do 0
about 0
it. 0

A 0
Worldwide 0
Network 0
of 0
Corruption, 0
Beginning 0
at 0
the 0
Top 0

None 0
of 0
the 0
foregoing 0
is 0
meant 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
the 0
homosexual 0
invasion 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
hierarchy 0
is 0
confined 0
to 0
American 0
prelates 0
and 0
priests. 0

The 0
spread 0
of 0
clerical 1
sodomy 1
has 0
not 0
respected 0
national 0
boundaries 0
but 0
rather 0
extends 0
throughout 0
the 0
Church 0
under 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
a 0
Vatican 0
apparatus 0
that 0
is 0
itself 0
thoroughly 1
infested 1
with 1
homosexuals. 1

This 0
is 0
thanks 0
in 0
large 0
measure 0
to 0
Bergoglio, 0
who 0
made 0
a 1
flagrantly 1
active 1
homosexual, 1
Monsignor 0
Battista 0
Ricca, 0
“prelate 1
of 1
the 1
gay 1
lobby,” 1
no 0
less 0
than 0
head 0
of 0
his 0
papal 0
household. 0

Moreover, 0
it 0
was 0
Bergoglio’s 0
right 0
hand 0
man, 0
Cardinal 0
Maradiaga, 0
who 0
sheltered 0
his 0
friend, 0
Juan 0
José 0
Pineda, 0
auxiliary 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Tegucigalpa, 0
from 0
any 0
discipline 0
over 0
his 0
notorious 0
homosexual 0
liaisons 0
with 0
seminarians 0
in 0
that 0
diocese. 0

When 0
an 0
apostolic 0
visitation, 0
compelled 0
by 0
mounting 0
public 0
pressure, 0
confirmed 0
the 0
charges 0
against 0
Pineda, 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
resign, 0
even 0
as 0
Maradiaga 0
dismissed 0
the 0
incontestable 0
proofs 0
against 0
him 0
as 0
“slander.” 0
Viganò 0
notes 0
that 0
“the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
public 0
is 0
that 0
his 0
resignation 0
has 0
simply 0
been 0
accepted, 0
thus 0
making 0
any 0
possible 0
responsibility 0
of 0
his 0
and 0
Maradiaga 0
vanish 1
into 1
nowhere.” 1

Despite 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
his 0
friend 0
Pineda, 0
Maradiaga 0
continues 0
todefend 0
and 0
protect 0
the 0
homosexual 0
corruption 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
seminary, 0
involving 0
incontrovertible 0
evidence 0
of 0
rampant 1
sodomy 1
among 0
the 0
seminarians 0
he 0
refuses 0
to 0
dismiss, 0
rejecting 0
all 0
the 0
evidence 0
as 0
“gossip.” 0
Concerning 0
Maradiaga, 0
who 0
is 0
also 0
mired 1
in 1
financial 1
corruption 1
for 0
which 0
he 0
offers 0
no 0
credible 0
explanation, 0
Viganò 0
provides 0
this 1
withering 1
assessment 1
of 0
the 0
man 0
and 0
his 0
relation 0
to 0
Bergoglio: 0

In 0
a 0
team 0
effort 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
[McCarrick] 0
had 0
become 0
the 1
kingmaker 1
for 0
appointments 0
in 0
the 0
Curia 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and 0
the 0
most 0
listened 0
to 0
advisor 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
for 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

This 0
is 0
how 0
one 0
explains 0
that, 0
as 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
the 0
Pope 0
replaced 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
with 0
Wuerl 0
and 0
immediately 0
appointed 0
Cupich 0
right 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
made 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

With 0
these 0
appointments 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
was 0
now 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
picture 0
in 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
bishops….. 0
By 0
now 0
the 0
faithful 0
have 0
well 0
understood 0
Maradiaga’s 0
strategy: 0
insult 0
the 0
victims 0
to 0
save 0
himself, 0
lie 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
a 1
chasm 1
of 1
abuses 1
of 1
power, 1
of 0
mismanagement 0
in 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Church 0
property, 0
and 0
of 0
financial 0
disasters 0
even 0
against 0
close 0
friends, 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Ambassador 0
of 0
Honduras 0
Alejandro 0
Valladares, 0
former 0
Dean 0
of 0
the 0
Diplomatic 0
Corps 0

Holy 0
See…. 0

The 0
Pope 0
defends 0
his 0
man, 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end, 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
done 0
in 0
Chile 0
with 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
de 0
la 0
Cruz 0
Barros, 0
whom 0
he 0
himself 0
had 0
appointed 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Osorno 0
against 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
Bishops. 0

First, 0
he 0
insulted 0
the 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

Then, 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
and 0
a 0
revolt 0
by 0
the 0
Chilean 0
victims 0
and 0
faithful, 0
did 0
he 0
recognize 0
his 0
error 0
and 0
apologize, 0
while 0
stating 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misinformed, 0
causing 0
a 0
disastrous 0
situation 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Chile, 0
but 0
continuing 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
two 0
Chilean 0
Cardinals 0
Errazuriz 0
and 0
Ezzati. 0

On 0
the 0
very 0
day 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
was 0
made 0
public, 0
Sandro 0
Magister 0
summed 0
up 0
the 0
entire 0
state 0
of 0
affairs 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
universal 0
after 0
decades 0
of 0
unrestricted 0
homosexual 0
migration 0
into 0
the 0
hierarchy, 0
to 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
has 1
contributed 1
mightily: 1
“From 1
the 1
seminaries, 1
to 1
the 1
clergy, 1
to 1
the 1
bishops, 1
to 1
the 1
cardinals, 1
homosexuals 1
are 1
present 1
at 1
all 1
levels, 1
by 1
the 1
thousand.” 1

Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
now 0
provides 0
his 0
own 0
decisive 0
summary 0
of 0
the 0
situation, 0
based 0
on 0
firsthand 0
experience 0
with 0
a 0
now 0
endemic 1
homosexual 1
corruption 1
of 0
the 0
Church: 0

Janet 1
Smith, 1
Professor 1
of 1
Moral 1
Theology 1
at 1
the 1
Sacred 1
Heart 1
Major 1
Seminary 1
in 1
Detroit, 1
recently 1
wrote: 1
“The 1
problem 1
of 1
clergy 1
abuse 1
cannot 1
be 1
resolved 1
simply 1
by 1
the 1
resignation 1
of 1
some 1
bishops, 1
and 1
even 1
less 1
so 1
by 1
bureaucratic 1
directives. 1

The 1
deeper 1
problem 1
lies 1
in 1
homosexual 1
networks 1
within 1
the 1
clergy 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
eradicated.” 1
These 0
homosexual 0
networks, 0
which 0
are 0
now 0
widespread 0
in 0
many 0
dioceses, 0
seminaries, 0
religious 0
orders, 0

act 0
under 0
the 0

with 1
the 1
power 1
of 1

demand 0
a 0
new 0
Shepherd.” 0
Even 0
Michael 0
Voris, 0
in 0
a 0
highly 0
amusing 0
example 0
of 0
leading 0
from 0
behind, 0
has 0
finally 0
abandoned 0
his 0
absurd 0
refusal 0
to 0
criticize 0
this 0
pontificate 0
and 0
now 0
declares 0
with 0
a 0
screaming 1
headline: 1
“Pope 1
Francis 1
Must 1
Resign.” 1

Nearly 0
three 0
years 0
ago, 0
seeing 0
what 0
was 0
certainly 0
coming 0
on 0
the 0
disastrous 1
course 0
Bergoglio 0
had 0
already 0
clearly 0
established, 0
this 0
newspaper 0
published 0
a 0
petition 0
which 0
states: 0
“We 0
your 0
subjects 0
respectfully 0
petition 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
to 0
change 0
course 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
welfare 0
of 0
souls. 0

Failing 0
this, 0
would 0
it 0
not 0
be 0
better 0
for 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
to 0
renounce 0
the 0
Petrine 0
office 0
than 0
to 0
preside 0
over 0
what 0
threatens 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
catastrophic 1
compromise 1
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
integrity?” 0
Our 0
petition 0
was 0
of 0
course 0
dismissed 0
as 0
“ridiculous” 1
by 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentariat. 0

Today, 0
our 0
ridiculous 0
suggestion 0
is 0
the 0
stuff 0
of 0
mainstream 0
news. 0

From 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
perspective, 0
the 0
events 0
of 0
recent 0
days 0
present 0
a 0
terrifying 1
prospect: 1
the 0
final 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
establishment, 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
conciliar 0
aggiornamento 0
and 0
a 0
revival 0
of 0
integral 0
Tradition, 0
which 0
growing 0
numbers 0
of 0
young 0
people 0
are 0
seeking. 0

Hence 0
even 0
before 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
had 0
come 0
forward, 0
commentators 0
like 0
Faggioli 0
were 0
already 0
sounding 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
air 1
raid 1
siren. 1

Faggioli 0
fretted 1
that 0
“[t]he 0
abuse 0
scandal 0
and 0
delegitimization 0
of 0
the 0
episcopate 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
great 0
power 0
vacuum 0
in 0
the 0
Church” 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
filled 0
by 0
the 0
“neo-traditionalist 0
Catholicism 0
of 0
the 0
younger 0
generations 0
of 0
American 0
Catholics” 0
who 0
“attack 0
American 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
close 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis.” 0
Accordingly, 0
he 0
rushed 0
to 0
the 0
defense 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
and 0
his 1
corrupt 1
regime 1
against 0
“a 0
radicalization 0
of 0
religious 0
conservatism 0
in 0
the 0
neo-traditionalism 0
sense...” 0

For 1
Faggioli, 1
not 1
only 1
would 1
Bergoglio’s 1
resignation 1
be 1
unthinkable, 1
so 1
also 1
would 1
a 1
purge 1
of 1
the 1
homosexual 1
and 1
pro-homosexual 1
prelates 1
Bergoglio 1
and 1
his 1
Vatican 1
henchmen 1
have 1
systematically 1
enabled. 1

The 0
Pope, 0
he 0
argues, 0
is 0
not 0
“the 1
CEO 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
world, 1
and 0
the 0
bishops 0
as 0
its 0
managers 0
whom 0
the 0
Pope 0
can 0
simply 0
fire.” 0
No, 0
Bergoglio 0
cannot 0
“simply 0
fire” 0
bishops. 0

Except 0
whenever 0
he 0
pleases, 0
as 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
again 0
and 0
again 0
with 0
the 1
conservative 1
bishops 1
and 1
even 1
Cardinals 1
(Burke 1
and 1
Müller) 1
he 1
has 1
sacked 1
because 1
their 1
conservatism 1
offended 1
him 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
friends, 1
prompting 0
even 0
Crux 0
to 0
ask: 0
“Does 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
have 1
an 1
enemies 1
list?” 1
Then 0
again, 0
Francis 0
even 0
obtained 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
“trusted 1
counselor” 1
McCarrick 1
from 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals, 0
albeit 0
only 0
when 0
forced 0
to 0
act 0
due 0
to 0
worldwide 0
condemnation 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

So, 0
according 0
to 0
Faggioli, 0
the 1
same 1
Pope 1
who 1
sacks 1
conservative 1
bishops 1
and 1
cardinals 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
pleasure 1
and 1
has 1
just 1
removed 1
a 1
cardinal 1
from 1
the 1
College 1
of 1
Cardinals 1
in 1
an 1
unprecedented 1
disciplinary 1
act 1
under 1
fire 1
from 1
the 1
media, 1
is 1
somehow 1
powerless 1
to 1
dismiss 1
Modernist 1
bishops 1
who 1
have 1
created 1
an 1
obscene 1
“gay 1
culture” 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
and 1
replace 1
them 1
with 1
orthodox, 1
normal 1
heterosexual 1
males. 1

Francis 1
cannot 1
“simply 1
fire” 1
even 1
Cardinal 1
Wuerl, 1
who 1
covered 1
up 1
crimes 1
of 1
homosexual 1
predation 1
by 1
the 1
priests 1
he 1
transferred 1
elsewhere 1
while 1
Archbishop 1
of 1
Pittsburgh, 1
and 1
who 1
authorized 1
payment 1
of 1
$900,000 1
in 1
hush 1
money 1
to 1
bury 1
sexual 1
abuse 1
claims 1
against 1
a 1
homosexual 1
priest 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
production 1
of 1
child 1
pornography. 1

Wuerl, 0
says 0
Faggioli, 0
“faces 0
a 0
complex 0
situation: 0
on 0
the 0
one 0
hand 0
Wuerl 0
was 0
not 0
afraid 0
of 0
clashing 0
with 0
the 0
tribunal 0
over 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
which 0
wanted 0
to 0
readmit 0
a 0
priest 0
from 0
the 0
Pittsburgh 0
diocese 0
to 0
ministry… 0
while 0
in 0
other 0
cases 0
he 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
collaborated 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
some 0
cases… 0
It 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
difficult 0
position 0
also 0
because 0
Wuerl 0
became 0
a 0
symbol… 0
beyond 0
the 0
specific 0
accusations 0
against 0
him, 0
from 0
which 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
publicly 0
defend 0
himself.” 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
because 0
his 0
situation 0
is 0
“complex” 0
Wuerl, 0
unlike 0
McCarrick, 0
should 0
remain 0
a 0
cardinal 0
and 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington, 0
DC, 0
thus 0
maintaining 1
a 1
key 1
bulwark 1
against 1
the 1
“neo-traditionalist” 1
threat. 1

Yet, 0
as 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
documents, 0
Wuerl 0
assisted 0
McCarrick 0
in 0
the 0
coverup 0
of 0
his 0
crimes 0
and 0
now 0
brazenly 1
lies 1
about 1
it. 1

Here 0
too 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
sheds 1
light 1
on 1
the 1
darkness: 1

…. 0

I 0
myself 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
subject 0
[of 0
McCarrick] 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
on 0
several 0
occasions, 0
and 0
I 0
certainly 0
didn’t 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
into 0
detail 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
immediately 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
it. 0

I 0
also 0
remember 0
in 0
particular 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
draw 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
it, 0
because 0
I 0
realized 0
that 0
in 0
an 0
archdiocesan 0
publication, 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
cover 0
in 0
color, 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
announcement 0
inviting 0
young 0
men 0
who 0
thought 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
vocation 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

I 0
immediately 0
phoned 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
who 0
expressed 0
his 0
surprise 0
to 0
me, 0
telling 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
that 0
announcement 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
cancel 0
it. 0

If, 1
as 1
he 1
now 1
continues 1
to 1
state, 1
he 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
abuses 1
committed 1
by 1
McCarrick 1
and 1
the 1
measures 1
taken 1
by 1
Pope 1
Benedict, 1
how 1
can 1
his 1
answer 1
be 1
explained? 1

His 0
recent 0
statements 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it, 0
even 0
though 0
at 0
first 0
he 0
cunningly 0
referred 0
to 0
compensation 0
for 0
the 0
two 0
victims, 0
are 0
absolutely 1
laughable. 1

The 0
Cardinal 0
lies 1
shamelessly 1
and 0
prevails 0
upon 0
his 0
Chancellor, 0
Monsignor 0
Antonicelli, 0
to 0
lie 0
as 0
well. 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
also 0
clearly 0
lied 0
on 0
another 0
occasion. 0

Following 0
a 0
morally 0
unacceptable 0
event 0
authorized 0
by 0
the 0
academic 0
authorities 0
of 0
Georgetown 0
University, 0
I 0
brought 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
its 0
President, 0
Dr. 0
John 0
DeGioia, 0
sending 0
him 0
two 0
subsequent 0
letters. 0

Before 0
forwarding 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
addressee, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
handle 0
things 0
properly, 0
I 0
personally 0
gave 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
with 0
an 0
accompanying 0
letter 0
I 0
had 0
written. 0

The 0
Cardinal 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it. 0

However, 1
he 1
failed 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
receipt 1
of 1
my 1
two 1
letters, 1
contrary 1
to 1
what 1
he 1
customarily 1
did. 1

I 0
subsequently 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
event 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
had 0
taken 0
place 0
for 0
seven 0
years. 0

But 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it! 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
continuous 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
transgressing 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
order, 0
also 0
allowed 0
him 0
to 0
reside 0
at 0
a 0
seminary 0
in 0
Washington 0
D.C. 0

In 0
doing 0
so, 0
he 1
put 1
other 1
seminarians 1
at 1
risk. 1

[emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0

What 0
really 0
concerns 0
Faggioli 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
think 0
like 0
him 0
is 0
not 0
Wuerl 0
and 0
his 0
“complex 0
situation,” 0
which 0
is 0
not 0
complex 0
at 0
all. 0

Rather, 0
what 0
he 0
views 0
with 0
alarm 0
as 0
an 0
“essential 0
element” 0
of 0
the 0
context 0
in 0
which 0
Wuerl 0
operates 0
is 0
that 0
“scandals 0
are 0
also 0
the 0
opportunity 0
for 0
the 0
neo-traditionalist 0
Catholicism 0
of 0
the 0
younger 0
generations 0
of 0
American 0
Catholics 0
to 0
attack 0
American 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
close 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis….” 0
Better 1
a 1
thousand 1
septuagenarian 1
Wuerls 1
in 1
their 1
lavish 1
sties 1
of 1
corruption, 1
financed 1
by 1
the 1
faithful, 1
than 1
a 1
single, 1
young 1
neo-traditionalist 1
prelate! 1

But 0
what 0
exactly 0
is 0
a 0
neo-traditionalist? 0

Quite 0
simply: 0
an 1
orthodox 1
Catholic 1
who 1
has 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
the 1
homosexual-infested 1
regime 1
of 1
novelty 1
imposed 1
on 1
the 1
Church 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
Council, 1
Bergoglio 0
merely 0
being 0
the 0
latest, 0
the 0
highest 0
placed, 0
and 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
last. 0

As 1
Faggioli 1
puts 1
it: 1
“In 1
the 1
last 1
fifteen 1
years, 1
the 1
American 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
has 1
been 1
traversed 1
by 1
a 1
radicalization 1
of 1
religious 1
conservatism 1
in 1
the 1
neo-traditionalism 1
sense, 1
especially 1
in 1
the 1
younger 1
generations 1
of 1
priests 1
and 1
intellectuals. 1

They 1
interpret 1
the 1
current 1
abuse 1
crisis 1
as 1
fruit 1
of 1
the 1
mistakes 1
of 1
the 1
Council 1
itself 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
of 1
the 1
post-Council…” 1

Just 0
as 0
Faggioli 0
fears, 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
up-and-coming 0
generation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
clergy 0
and 0
laity 0
recognize 0
the 0
obvious: 0
that 0
the 0
conciliar 0
texts, 0
for 0
all 0
their 0
prolix 0
repetition 0
of 0
traditional 0
teaching, 0
opened 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
ecclesial 1
disaster. 1

Because 0
in 0
those 0
texts—above 0
all 0
Gaudium 0
et 0
Spes, 0
Dignitatis 0
Humanae, 0
Unitatis 0
Redintegratio, 0
Nostra 0
Aetate 0
and 0
Sacrosanctum 0
Concilium—the 0
Council 0
verbally 0
prostrated 0
itself 0
before 0
“the 0
modern 0
world” 0
and 0
the 0
practitioners 0
of 0
other 0
religions 0
while 0
authorizing 0
Bugnini 0
(Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
liturgical 0
Preparatory 0
Commission 0
that 0
drafted 0
what 0
would 0
become 0
Sacrosanctum 0
Concilium) 0
to 0
begin 0
demolition 1
of 1
the 1
sacred 1
liturgy 1
that 0
was 0
the 0
very 0
foundation 0
Catholic 0
of 0
orthodoxy 0
and 0
orthopraxis. 0

To 0
quote 0
Paul 0
VI, 0
then 0
in 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
his 1
conciliar 1
delirium 1
at 0
the 0
Council’s 0
close: 0

But 0
one 0
must 0
realize 0
that 0
this 0
council, 0
which 0
exposed 0
itself 0
to 0
human 0
judgment, 0
insisted 0
very 0
much 0
more 0
upon 0
this 0
pleasant 0
side 0
of 0
man, 0
rather 0
than 0
on 0
his 0
unpleasant 0
one. 0

Its 0
attitude 0
was 0
very 0
much 0
and 0
deliberately 0
optimistic. 0

A 0
wave 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
admiration 1
flowed 1
from 1
the 1
council 1
over 1
the 1
modern 1
world 1
of 1
humanity…. 1

Instead 0
of 0
depressing 0
diagnoses, 0
encouraging 0
remedies; 0
instead 0
of 0
direful 0
prognostics, 0
messages 0
of 0
trust 0
issued 0
from 0
the 0
council 0
to 0
the 0
present-day 0
world. 0

The 0
modern 0
world’s 0
values 0
were 0
not 0
only 0
respected 0
but 0
honored, 0
its 0
efforts 0
approved, 0
its 1
aspirations 1
purified 1
and 1
blessed. 1

[emphasis 0
added] 0

Thus 1
did 1
Paul 1
describe 1
the 1
conciliar 1
“opening 1
to 1
the 1
world” 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
world 1
promptly 1
invaded 1
the 1
Church, 1
including 1
large 1
numbers 1
of 1
homosexuals 1
who 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
been 1
admitted 1
to 1
the 1
seminary. 1

In 0
sum, 0
Faggioli 0
is 0
representative 0
of 0
the 0
thinking 0
that 0
requires 0
defense 0
of 0
a 0
homosexualized 0
clergy 0
if 0
only 0
for 0
the 0
reason 0
that 0
tradition-minded 0
Catholics 0
cannot 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
take 0
their 0
place: 0
“This 0
neo-traditionalist 0
Catholicism 0
believes 0
that 0
sexual 0
abuses 0
are 0
committed 0
only 0
by 0
homosexual 0
clergy… 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
crisis 0
of 0
abuse 0
can 0
be 0
resolved 0
by 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Jacobinism 0
that 0
should 0
eliminate 0
all 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
minimally 0
engaged 0
in 0
dialogue 0
with 0
modern 0
culture, 0
and 0
replaced 0
by 0
a 1
young 1
clergy 1
marked 1
by 1
personal 1
sanctity 1
but 1
also 1
by 1
a 1
fascination 1
for 1
a 1
mythical 1
Middle 1
Ages 1
and 0
the 0
rejection 0
of 0
a 0
Church-world 0
relationship 0
based 0
on 0
a 0
principle 0
of 0
reality.” 0

Rather 0
than 0
“young 1
clergy 1
marked 1
by 1
personal 1
sanctity,” 1
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
mentality 0
Faggioli 0
exemplifies 0
prefers 0
that 0
homosexual 0
priests 0
and 0
bishops 0
be 0
kept 0
in 0
place 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
“dialogue 0
with 0
modern 0
culture.” 0
It 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
that 0
matters 0
but 0
only 0
perpetuation 0
of 0
the 0
post-conciliar 0
regime 0
of 0
novelty. 0

Any 1
abandonment 1
of 1
the 1
regime 1
must 1
be 1
viewed 1
as 1
ecclesiastical 1
treason—“Catholic 1
Jacobinism”—if 1
not 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

Faggioli 0
would 0
probably 0
be 0
more 0
inclined 0
to 0
civil 0
or 0
criminal 0
prosecution 0
of 0
“Catholic 0
Jacobins” 0
for 0
“hate 0
speech” 0
than 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
bishops 0
for 0
their 0
complicity 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
homosexual 0
rapes. 0

“Homosexuality 1
in 1
the 1
clergy 1
exists 1
and 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
addressed,” 1
Faggioli 0
fleetingly 0
acknowledges 0
toward 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
his 0
piece, 0
“but 0
the 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
cannot 0
be 0
resolved 0
by 0
making 0
homosexuals 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
the 0
scapegoat 0
of 0
a 0
scandal 0
that 0
has 0
ancient 0
roots, 0
well 0
before 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
II.” 0
And 1
how 1
does 1
the 1
Church 1
“address” 1
a 1
massive 1
infestation 1
by 1
homosexual 1
priests 1
and 1
prelates 1
without 1
removing 1
them 1
from 1
authority 1
and 1
ensuring 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
promote 1
homosexual 1
successors 1
for 1
generation 1
after 1
generation? 1

Faggioli 0
has 0
no 0
answer 0
because 0
what 1
he 1
is 1
really 1
arguing—the 1
final 1
beachhead 1
of 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
defense 1
of 1
their 1
disintegrating 1
regime—is 1
that 1
homosexuals 1
in 1
the 1
hierarchy 1
must 1
remain 1
in 1
authority 1
as 1
an 1
indispensable 1
seawall 1
against 1
a 1
“neo-traditionalist” 1
storm 1
surge. 1

Faggioli’s 1
argument 1
demonstrates 1
that 1
neo-Catholicism 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
about 1
making 1
the 1
authentic 1
Faith 1
more 1
appealing 1
to 1
a 1
“modern 1
world” 1
founded 1
precisely 1
on 1
a 1
rejection 1
of 1
the 1
Church’s 1
authority. 1

It 1
is 1
not 1
about 1
the 1
Faith 1
at 1
all. 1

Rather, 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
ideological 1
movement 1
dedicated 1
to 1
the 1
face-saving 1
defense 1
of 1
a 1
catastrophic 1
failure 1
in 1
ecclesial 1
innovation 1
that 1
has 1
corrupted 1
the 1
human 1
element 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
practically 1
every 1
department. 1

For 0
people 0
like 0
Faggioli, 0
indeed 0
for 0
the 1
tradition-hating 1
Pope 1
they 0
blindly 0
defend, 0
the 0
one 0
thing 0
to 0
be 0
feared 0
is 0
that 0
more 1
and 1
more 1
faithful 1
will 1
recognize 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
polemic 1
for 1
what 1
it 1
is—a 1
fraud—and 1
begin 1
demanding 1
a 1
return 1
of 1
everything 1
the 1
regime 1
of 1
novelty 1
has 1
stolen 1
from 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

That 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
a 1
growing 1
number 1
of 1
Catholics 1
are 1
now 1
doing, 1
as 1
even 1
the 1
secular 1
press 1
recognized 1
less 1
than 1
three 1
months 1
before 1
Bergoglio 1
began 1
his 1
tyrannical 1
reign. 1

In 0
this 0
respect, 0
what 0
the 0
neo-Catholics 0
are 0
defending 0
at 0
bottom 0
is 0
themselves—that 0
is, 0
the 0
reputations 0
they 0
have 0
all 0
staked 0
on 0
their 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
indefensible 0
against 0
the 0
traditionalists 0
they 0
have 0
arrogantly 0
mocked 0
and 0
marginalized 0
for 0
decades 0
only 0
to 0
see, 0
to 1
their 1
horror, 1
that 0
traditionalism 0
is 0
ever 0
more 0
vindicated 0
as 0
the 0
scandals 0
of 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
mount 1
under 1
this 1
reckless 1
Pope 1
to 1
an 1
unsustainable, 1
indeed 1
apocalyptic, 1
level. 1

A 0
return 0
to 0
integral 0
Tradition 0
is 0
the 0
threat 0
that 0
Faggioli 0
sees 0
as 0
coming 0
particularly 0
from 0
the 0
young. 0

Irony 1
of 1
ironies, 1
he 0
is 0
now 0
reduced 0
to 0
defending 0
what 0
is 0
old 0
and 0
tired 0
and 0
corrupt 0
against 0
a 0
restoration, 0
led 0
largely 0
by 0
a 1
youthful 1
vanguard, 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
ever 1
ancient 1
but 1
ever 1
new. 1

For 0
some, 0
it 0
seems, 0
no 0
price 0
is 0
too 0
great—not 0
even 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church—to 0
avoid 0
the 0
personal 0
ignominy 0
of 0
being 0
seen 0
on 0
the 0
wrong 0
side 0
of 0
history. 0

Conclusion: 0
The 0
Fatima 0
Connection 0

Long 0
before 0
the 0
arrival 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
Rome, 0
the 0
successive 0
Vatican 0
Secretaries 0
of 0
State, 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
were 0
instrumental 0
in 0
advancing 0
the 0
homosexual 0
corruption 0
of 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
establishment. 0

As 0
to 0
Bertone 0
and 0
Sodano, 0
Viganò 0
provides 0
further 0
vital 0
testimony: 0

Nuncio 0
Sambi’s 0
report 0
[on 0
McCarrick’s 0
sexual 0
abuse], 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
attachments, 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

My 0
two 0
above-mentioned 0
memos 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
and 0
May 0
25, 0
2008, 0
were 0
also 0
presumably 0
handed 0
over 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
the 0
Substitute. 0

As 0
already 0
mentioned, 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
had 0
no 0
difficulty 0
in 0
insistently 0
presenting 0
for 0
the 0
episcopate 0
candidates 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
active 1
homosexuals 1
— 0
I 0
cite 0
only 0
the 0
well-known 0
case 0
of 0
Vincenzo 0
de 0
Mauro, 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
Archbishop-Bishop 0
of 0
Vigevano 0
and 0
later 0
removed 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
undermining 0
his 0
seminarians 0
— 0
and 0
in 0
filtering 0
and 0
manipulating 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
conveyed 0
to 0
Pope 0
Benedict…. 0

Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
was 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
until 0
September 0
2006: 0
all 0
information 0
[concerning 0
McCarrick] 0
was 0
communicated 0
to 0
him. 0

In 0
November 0
2000, 0
Nunzio 0
Montalvo 0
sent 0
him 0
his 0
report, 0
passing 0
on 0
to 0
him 0
the 0
aforementioned 0
letter 0
from 0
Father 0
Boniface 0
Ramsey 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
denounced 0
the 0
serious 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

It 0
is 0
known 0
that 0
Sodano 0
tried 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
Father 0
Maciel 0
scandal 0
to 0
the 0
end. 0

He 0
even 0
removed 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
Justo 0
Mullor, 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
accomplice 0
in 0
his 0
scheme 0
to 0
cover 0
Maciel, 0
and 0
in 0
his 0
place 0
appointed 0
Sandri, 0
then-Nuncio 0
to 0
Venezuela, 0
who 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
collaborate 0
in 0
the 0
cover-up. 0

Sodano 0
even 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
issue 0
a 0
statement 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
press 0
office 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
falsehood 0
was 0
affirmed, 0
that 0
is, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
Maciel 0
case 0
should 0
be 0
considered 0
closed. 0

Benedict 0
reacted, 0
despite 0
Sodano’s 0
strenuous 0
defense, 0
and 0
Maciel 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
and 0
irrevocably 1
condemned. 1

It 0
is 0
no 0
coincidence 0
that, 0
as 0
I 0
detail 0
in 0
my 0
book 0
on 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
of 0
Fatima, 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Bertone 0
have 0
also 0
taken 0
the 0
leading 0
role 0
in 0
suppressing 0
the 0
integral 0
Secret 0
and 0
reducing 0
the 0
Message 0
of 0
Fatima 0
in 0
general 0
to 0
a 0
generic 0
prescription 0
for 0
personal 0
piety, 0
stripped 1
of 1
its 1
prophetic 1
and 1
admonitory 1
content 1
regarding 1
the 1
epochal 1
malfeasance 1
and 1
corruption 1
of 1
the 1
upper 1
hierarchy 1
to 0
which 0
they 0
belong. 0

Concerning 0
my 0
book, 0
Archbishop 0
Pietro 0
Sambi, 0
Viganò’s 0
predecessor 0
as 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Washington, 0
whom 0
Viganò’ 0
credits 0
with 0
diligently 0
reporting 0
McCarrick’s 0
crimes 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
and 0
conveying 0
Benedict’s 0
sanctions 0
to 0
McCarrick, 0
made 0
some 0
very 0
revealing 0
comments 0
during 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
Robert 0
Moynihan, 0
published 0
posthumously 0
six 0
years 0
ago 0
in 0
Inside 0
the 0
Vatican: 0

We 0
were 0
discussing 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
of 0
Fatima, 0
the 0
allegations 0
that 0
the 0
Vatican 0
has 0
not 0
published 0
the 0
entire 0
text 0
of 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
as 0
revealed 0
to 0
Sister 0
Lucia, 0
and 0
the 0
response 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
the 0
Vatican 0
secretary 0
of 0
state, 0
in 0
a 0
book 0
where 0
Bertone 0
states 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
to 0
be 0
revealed. 0

Sambi 0
said, 0
“Excuse 0
me.” 0
He 0
got 0
up, 0
went 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
room, 0
and 0
came 0
back 0
with 0
a 0
book. 0

“Here,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Do 0
you 0
know 0
this 0
book? 0

You 0
should 0
read 0
it.” 0
It 0
was 0
Christopher 0
Ferrara's 0
The 0
Secret 0
Still 0
Hidden. 0

“Wait,” 0
I 0
said. 0

“You 1
are 1
the 1
Pope’s 1
representative 1
in 1
the 1
US, 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
urging 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
book 1
that 1
questions 1
what 1
the 1
secretary 1
of 1
state 1
wrote?” 1
Sambi 0
replied, 0
“All 0
I 0
am 0
saying 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
interesting 0
things 0
worth 0
reading 0
in 0
this 0
book. 0

And 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
we 0
are 0
all 0
after 0
the 0
truth, 0
aren’t 0
we? 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
the 0
important 0
thing...” 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
indeed 0
the 0
important 0
thing. 0

And 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
our 0
situation 0
is 0
revealed 0
in 0
that 0
still-hidden 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Secret 0
to 0
whose 0
contents 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
alluded 0
during 0
his 0
pilgrimage 0
to 0
Fatima 0
in 0
2010, 0
identifying 0
elements 0
that 0
do 0
not 0
appear 0
at 0
all 0
in 0
the 0
obscure 0
vision 0
published 0
back 0
in 0
2000, 0
which 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Bertone 0
tried 0
to 0
pass 0
of 0
as 0
the 0
entirety 0
of 0
the 0
Secret 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
they 0
were 0
covering 0
up 0
homosexual 0
corruption 0
in 0
high 0
places: 0

As 0
for 0
the 0
new 0
things 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
find 0
in 0
this 0
message 0
today, 0
there 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
Pope 0
and 0
the 0
Church 0
come 0
not 0
only 0
from 0
without, 0
but 0
the 1
sufferings 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
come 0
precisely 0
from 0
within 0
the 0
Church, 0
from 0
the 0
sin 0
existing 0
within 0
the 0
Church. 0

This 0
too 0
is 0
something 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
always 0
known, 0
but 0
today 0
we 0
are 0
seeing 0
it 0
in 0
a 1
really 1
terrifying 1
way: 1
that 0
the 0
greatest 0
persecution 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
comes 0
not 0
from 0
her 0
enemies 0
without, 0
but 0
arises 0
from 0
sin 0
within 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
thus 0
has 0
a 1
deep 1
need 1
to 1
relearn 1
penance, 1
to 1
accept 1
purification, 1
to 1
learn 1
forgiveness 1
on 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
but 0
also 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
justice. 0

[emphasis 0
added] 0

I 1
believe 1
that 1
Archbishop 1
Viganò’s 1
precious 1
testimony 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
Heaven 1
itself 1
is 1
now 1
responding 1
to 1
the 1
“need 1
for 1
justice” 1
in 1
the 1
Church. 1

Whether 0
or 0
not 0
justice 0
involves 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
the 1
most 1
wayward 1
Pope 1
in 1
Church 1
history, 1
the 0
inevitable 0
season 0
of 0
justice 0
will 0
culminate 0
in 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
the 1
Immaculate 1
Heart 1
of 1
Mary 1
and 0
the 0
Church’s 0
restoration. 0

This 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
final 0
victory 0
over 0
the 0
enemies 0
within 0
and 0
their 0
apologists, 0
such 0
as 0
Faggioli, 0
who, 0
in 0
typical 0
neo-Catholic 0
style, 0
imperiously 1
scoffs 1
at 0
the 0
notion 0
of 0
“a 0
young 1
clergy 1
marked 1
by 1
personal 1
sanctity 1
but 1
also 1
by 1
a 1
fascination 1
for 1
a 1
mythical 1
Middle 1
Ages” 1
and 0
busies 0
himself 0
defending 0
an 1
unsalvageable 1
mass 1
of 1
corruption 1
he 0
dares 0
to 0
describe 0
as 0
“a 0
Church-world 1
relationship 1
based 1
on 1
a 1
principle 1
of 1
reality.” 1

I 0
can 0
only 0
conclude 0
by 0
making 0
my 0
own 0
these 0
closing 0
words 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò: 0
