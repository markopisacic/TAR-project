A 0
former 0
Navy 0
sailor 0
who 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
five 0
people 0
to 0
receive 0
a 0
pardon 0
from 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
is 0
planning 0
to 0
file 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials, 0
alleging 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
subject 0
to 0
unequal 0
protection 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

Specifically, 0
Kristian 0
Saucier, 0
who 0
served 0
a 0
year 0
in 0
federal 0
prison 0
for 0
taking 0
photos 0
of 0
classified 0
sections 0
of 0
the 0
submarine 0
on 0
which 0
he 0
worked, 0
argues 0
that 0
the 0
same 0
officials 0
who 0
meted 0
out 0
punishment 0
to 0
him 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
chose 0
to 0
be 0
lenient 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
in 0
her 0
use 0
of 0
a 0
private 0
email 0
server 0
and 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
information. 0

His 0
lawyer, 0
Ronald 0
Daigle, 0
told 0
Fox 0
News 0
on 0
Monday 0
that 0
the 0
lawsuit, 0
which 0
he 0
expects 0
to 0
file 0
soon 0
in 0
Manhattan, 0
will 0
name 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice, 0
former 0
FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
Comey 0
and 0
former 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
as 0
defendants, 0
among 0
others. 0

“They 0
interpreted 0
the 0
law 0
in 0
my 0
case 0
to 0
say 0
it 0
was 0
criminal,” 0
Saucier 0
told 0
Fox 0
News, 0
referring 0
to 0
prosecuting 0
authorities 0
in 0
his 0
case, 0
“but 0
they 0
didn’t 0
prosecute 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

Hillary 0
is 0
still 0
walking 0
free. 0

Two 0
guys 0
on 0
my 0
ship 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
and 0
weren’t 0
treated 0
as 0
criminals. 0

We 0
want 0
them 0
to 0
correct 0
the 0
wrong.” 0

Daigle 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
notice 0
about 0
the 0
pending 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
others 0
included 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
December. 0

There 0
is 0
usually 0
a 0
six-month 0
period 0
that 0
must 0
lapse 0
before 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
actually 0
is 0
filed. 0

“We’ll 0
highlight 0
the 0
differences 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
was 0
prosecuted 0
and 0
how 0
my 0
client 0
was 0
prosecuted,” 0
Daigle 0
said. 0

“We’re 0
seeking 0
to 0
cast 0
a 0
light 0
on 0
this 0
to 0
show 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 0
two-tier 0
justice 0
system 0
and 0
we 0
want 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
corrected.” 0

While 0
campaigning, 0
and 0
after 0
taking 0
office, 0
Trump 0
frequently 0
voiced 0
support 0
for 0
Saucier, 0
who 0
in 0
March 0
became 0
the 0
second 0
person 0
he 0
pardoned. 0

Trump 0
often 0
compared 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
handling 0
of 0
Saucier’s 0
case 0
with 0
that 0
of 0
Clinton. 0

Saucier, 0
who 0
lives 0
in 0
Vermont, 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
in 0
2016 0
to 0
taking 0
photos 0
inside 0
the 0
USS 0
Alexandria 0
while 0
it 0
was 0
stationed 0
in 0
Groton, 0
Connecticut, 0
in 0
2009. 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
only 0
wanted 0
service 0
mementos, 0
but 0
federal 0
prosecutors 0
argued 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
disgruntled 0
sailor 0
who 0
had 0
put 0
national 0
security 0
at 0
risk 0
by 0
taking 0
photos 0
showing 0
the 0
submarine's 0
propulsion 0
system 0
and 0
reactor 0
compartment 0
and 0
then 0
obstructed 0
justice 0
by 0
destroying 0
a 0
laptop 0
and 0
camera. 0

Saucier 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
recognized 0
he 0
had 0
erred 0
in 0
taking 0
the 0
photos, 0
which 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
show 0
only 0
to 0
his 0
family 0
to 0
show 0
them 0
where 0
he 0
worked. 0

But 0
he 0
lashed 0
out 0
at 0
Obama 0
officials, 0
saying 0
that 0
his 0
prosecution 0
was 0
politically 0
motivated, 0
prompted 0
by 0
sensitivity 0
about 0
classified 0
information 0
amid 0
the 0
scandal 0
involving 0
Clinton's 0
emails. 0

“My 0
case 0
was 0
usually 0
something 0
handled 0
by 0
military 0
courts,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“They 1
used 1
me 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
because 1
of 1
[the 1
backlash 1
over] 1
Hillary 1
Clinton.” 1

Saucier, 0
31, 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
pardon 0
has 0
enabled 0
him 0
to 0
pick 0
up 0
the 0
pieces 0
and 0
rebuild 0
his 0
life 0
with 0
his 0
wife 0
and 0
young 0
daughter. 0

A 0
felony 0
conviction 0
left 0
him 0
scrambling 0
to 0
find 0
work; 0
he 0
finally 0
landed 0
a 0
job 0
collecting 0
garbage. 0

Now, 0
he 0
works 0
on 0
design 0
and 0
engineering 0
projects 0
for 0
an 0
industrial 0
boiler 0
company. 0

“Things 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
go 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction,” 0
Saucier 0
said. 0

“I 0
work 0
with 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
really 0
great 0
people, 0
I 0
get 0
to 0
use 0
my 0
skills 0
set.” 0

Because 0
of 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
income 0
during 0
his 0
imprisonment, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
earning 0
below 0
his 0
potential 0
when 0
he 0
collected 0
garbage, 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
Sadie 0
lost 0
their 0
home 0
to 0
foreclosure. 0

Debt 0
collectors 0
called 0
and 0
his 0
cars 0
were 0
repossessed. 0

“With 0
a 0
pardon 0
there’s 0
no 0
magic 0
wand 0
that 0
that 0
gets 0
waved 0
and 0
makes 0
everything 0
right,” 0
he 0
said, 0
“But 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
stay 0
positive 0
and 0
look 0
forward.” 0

He 0
praises 0
the 0
pardons 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
granted, 0
and 0
takes 0
exception 0
at 0
the 0
criticism. 0

“The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
singled 0
out 0
Dinesh 0
for 0
things 0
most 0
people 0
don’t 0
even 0
get 0
charged 0
for,” 0
Saucier 0
said. 0

“President 0
Trump 0
noticed 0
that 0
my 0
career 0
was 0
exemplary 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
didn’t 0
deserve 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
me. 0

Conservative 0
commentator 0
Dinesh 0
D'Souza, 0
who 0
was 0
pardoned 0
by 0
Trump 0
last 0
week, 0
had 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
campaign 0
finance 0
fraud. 0

Trump 0
tweeted 0
Thursday: 0
"Will 0
be 0
giving 0
a 0
Full 0
Pardon 0
to 0
Dinesh 0
D'Souza 0
today. 0

He 0
was 0
treated 0
very 0
unfairly 0
by 0
our 1
government!" 1

D'Souza 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
2014 0
