the 1
enemy 1

“The 1

that 1

him 1
during 1
the 1

that 0

relationship 0
with 0
Nation 0
of 0

Louis 0
Farrakhan, 0
a 0

isn’t 0
bothered 0
by 0
Farrakhan’s 0
position 0
on 0
“the 0
Jewish 0
question.” 0
Farrakhan 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
denounced 1
Jews 1
as 1
“satanic,” 1
praised 1

as 1
a 1
“very 1
great 1
man” 1

has 1
said 1
that 1
white 1
people 1
“deserve 1
to 1
die.” 1
The 0
congressman 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
why 0
the 0
ADL 0
wrote 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misquoted 0
in 0
his 0
praise 0
for 0
the 0
anti-Semite, 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
if 0
someone 0
from 0
his 0
office 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
ADL 0
he 0
was 0
misquoted, 0
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
News 0
Foundation 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

“I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
to 0
write. 0

Nah, 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
Farrakhan, 0
I 0
don’t 0
spend 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
my 0
time 0
dealing 0
with 0
those 0
kind 0
of 0
things,” 0
Davis 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
just 0
one 0
segment 0
of 0
what 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
our 0
world. 0

The 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
Farrakhan 1
and 1
the 1
Jewish 1
question 1
and 1
his 1
position 1
on 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
forth. 1

For 0
those 0
heavy 0
into 0
it, 0
that’s 0
their 0
thing, 0
but 0
it 0
ain’t 0
my 0
thing,” 0
he 0
said 0

The 1
people 1
who 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
"Jewish 1
question" 1
are 1
generally 1
anti-Semites. 1

Somehow 0
I 0
don't 0
think 0
a 0
white 0
congressman 0
would 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
saying 0
that 0
he 0
agrees 0
with 0
David 0
Duke 0
on 0
the 0
environment 0
but 0
isn't 0
especially 0
concerned 0
about 0
his 0
racism. 0

But 0
black 0
leaders 0
have 0
gotten 0
away 0
with 0
playing 0
that 0
game 0
with 0
Farrakhan 0
repeatedly. 0

But 0
the 0
ADL 0
and 0
the 0
JTA 0
will 0
whitewash 1
this 0
again. 0

And 1
if 1
they 1
can't 1
whitewash 1
this, 1
they'll 1
ignore 1
it. 1
