spend 0 182 14
a 0 182 14
whole 0 182 14
lot 0 182 14
of 0 182 14
my 0 182 14
time 0 182 14

those 0 182 14
kind 0 182 14
of 0 182 14
things,” 0 182 14

said. 0 182 14

“That’s 0 182 15
just 0 182 15
one 0 182 15
segment 0 182 15

goes 0 182 15
on 0 182 15
in 0 182 15
our 0 182 15

The 1 182 16
world 1 182 16
is 1 182 16
so 1 182 16
much 1 182 16
bigger 1 182 16
than 1 182 16
Farrakhan 1 182 16
and 1 182 16
the 1 182 16
Jewish 1 182 16

his 1 182 16

so 1 182 16
forth. 1 182 16

For 0 182 17
those 0 182 17
heavy 0 182 17
into 0 182 17
it, 0 182 17
that’s 0 182 17
their 0 182 17
thing, 0 182 17
but 0 182 17
it 0 182 17
ain’t 0 182 17
my 0 182 17
thing,” 0 182 17
he 0 182 17
said 0 182 17

The 1 182 18
people 1 182 18
who 1 182 18
talk 1 182 18
about 1 182 18
the 1 182 18
"Jewish 1 182 18
question" 1 182 18
are 1 182 18
generally 1 182 18
anti-Semites. 1 182 18

Somehow 0 182 19
I 0 182 19
don't 0 182 19
think 0 182 19
a 0 182 19
white 0 182 19
congressman 0 182 19
would 0 182 19
get 0 182 19
away 0 182 19
with 0 182 19
saying 0 182 19
that 0 182 19
he 0 182 19
agrees 0 182 19
with 0 182 19
David 0 182 19
Duke 0 182 19
on 0 182 19
the 0 182 19
environment 0 182 19
but 0 182 19
isn't 0 182 19
especially 0 182 19
concerned 0 182 19
about 0 182 19
his 0 182 19
racism. 0 182 19

But 0 182 20
black 0 182 20
leaders 0 182 20
have 0 182 20
gotten 0 182 20
away 0 182 20
with 0 182 20
playing 0 182 20
that 0 182 20
game 0 182 20
with 0 182 20
Farrakhan 0 182 20
repeatedly. 0 182 20

But 0 182 21
the 0 182 21
ADL 0 182 21
and 0 182 21
the 0 182 21
JTA 0 182 21
will 0 182 21
whitewash 1 182 21
this 0 182 21
again. 0 182 21

And 1 182 21

if 1 182 21

they 1 182 21

can't 1 182 21

whitewash 1 182 21

this, 1 182 21

they'll 1 182 21

ignore 1 182 21

it. 1 182 21
