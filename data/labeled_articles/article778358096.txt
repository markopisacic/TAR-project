"The 1

that 0
the 0

because 0
Muslims 0
are 0

that 0
this 1
was 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
"domestic 1

"None 0

anything 0

to 0
go 0
in 0

up 0

"Because 1
it's 1
a 1
Muslim 1

the 1
circumstances 1
that 1

they 1

the 1
fact 1

that 1
the 1

anything 1

nice, 1
polite, 1
just 1
or 1
holy 1
