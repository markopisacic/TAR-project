outraged 1
when 0

To 0

No 0
one 0
forced 0
J 0
Street 0
to 0
collaborate 0
with 0
anti-Semites. 0

And 0
here's 0
J 0
Street 0
trying 0
to 0
decide 0
whether 0
to 0
stop 0
endorsing 0
a 1
Democrat 1
who 1
pals 1
around 1
with 1
Farrakhan 1
and 0
defended 0
him 0
by 0
mentioning 0
the 0
"Jewish 1
question." 1

Democratic 0
Illinois 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
defended 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan 0
as 0
an 0
“outstanding 0
human 0
being” 0
on 0
Monday. 0

Farrakhan’s 0
history 0
of 0
racially 1
extreme 1
comments 1
includes 0
blaming 0
Jews 0
for 0
the 0
September 0
11 0
attacks, 0
saying 0
white 1
people 1
“deserve 1
to 1
die” 1
and 0
praising 1
Adolf 1
Hitler 1
as 1
a 1
“very 1
great 1
man.” 1
“I 0
personally 0
know 0
[Farrakhan], 0
I’ve 0
been 0
to 0
his 0
home, 0
done 0
meetings, 0
participated 0
in 0
events 0
with 0
him,” 0
Davis 0
told 0
TheDC. 0

The 0
congressman 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
why 0
the 0
ADL 0
wrote 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misquoted 0
in 0
his 0
praise 0
for 0
the 0
anti-Semite, 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
if 0
someone 0
from 0
his 0
office 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
ADL 0
he 0
was 0
misquoted, 0
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
News 0
Foundation 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

“I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
to 0
write. 0

Nah, 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
Farrakhan, 0
I 0
don’t 0
spend 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
my 0
time 0
dealing 0
with 0
those 0
kind 0
of 0
things,” 0
Davis 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
just 0
one 0
segment 0
of 0
what 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
our 0
world. 0

The 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
Farrakhan 1
and 1
the 1
Jewish 1
question 1
and 1
his 1
position 1
on 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
forth. 1

For 0
those 0
heavy 0
into 0
it, 0
that’s 0
their 0
thing, 0
but 0
it 0
ain’t 0
my 0
thing,” 0
he 0
said 0

The 0
"Jewish 0
Question" 0
is 0
a 0
term 0
generally 0
used 0
by 0
anti-Semites 0
today. 0

But 0
J 0
Street 0
is 0
stuck 0
with 0
its 0
own 0
Jewish 0
Question. 0

How 0
much 0
anti-Semitism 0
is 0
too 0
much 0
even 0
for 0
it. 0

Left-wing 0
advocacy 0
group 0
J 0
Street 0
said 0
it 0
is 0
re-evaluating 0
its 0
endorsement 0
of 0
a 0
congressman 0
who 0
praised 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan. 0

JStreetPAC, 0
the 0
arm 0
of 0
the 0
NGO 0
that 0
funds 0
and 0
endorses 0
candidates, 0
currently 0
lists 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis, 0
an 0
Illinois 0
Democrat 0
from 0
the 0
virulently 1
anti-Semitic 1
Farrakhan’s 0
home 0
base 0
of 0
Chicago, 0
as 0
a 0
candidate 0
it 0
supports. 0

The 0
endorsement, 0
first 0
reported 0
in 0
the 0
Forward, 0
calls 0
Davis 0
“a 0
longtime 0
supporter 0
of 0
Israel 0
and 0
a 0
two-state 0
solution.” 0

In 0
J 0
Street's 0
home 0
dimension 0
of 0
Oceania, 0
supporter 1
of 1
Israel 1
means 1
Farrakhan 1
supporter. 1

“We 0
take 0
anti-Semitism 0
quite 0
seriously,” 0
J 0
Street’s 0
statement 0
read. 0

“We 0
are 0
currently 0
in 0
conversation 0
with 0
Representative 0
Davis’ 0
office 0
about 0
this 0
issue. 0

We 0
will 0
get 0
back 0
to 0
you 0
shortly 0
with 0
a 0
more 0
extensive 0
response.” 0

So 1
seriously 1
that 1
J 1
Street 1
can't 1
decide 1
what 0
to 0
do 0
about 0
a 0
politician 0
who 0
defends 0
a 1
Hitler-lover 1
and 0
raises 0
the 0
Jewish 0
Question. 0

That's 0
serious 0
all 0
right. 0

Seriously 0
Kapo. 0
