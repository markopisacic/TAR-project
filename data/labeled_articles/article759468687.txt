us, 0

218 0
Infidels, 1

in 0

attacks. 0

Once 0
again 0
this 0
year 0
we 0
see 0
that 0
Ramadan 1
is 1
quintessentially 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad. 1

A 0
jihad 0
group 0
explained 0
it 0
back 0
in 0
2012: 0
“The 0
month 0
of 0
Ramadan 0
is 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
holy 1
war 1
and 1
death 1
for 1
Allah. 1

It 0
is 0
a 0
month 0
for 0
fighting 0
the 0
enemies 0
of 0
Allah 0
and 0
God’s 0
messenger, 0
the 0
Jews 0
and 0
their 0
American 1
facilitators.” 1
Referring 0
to 0
a 0
jihad 0
attack 0
that 0
happened 0
at 0
that 0
time, 0
the 0
message 0
continued: 0
“One 0
of 0
our 0
groups 0
aided 1
by 1
Allah 1
managed 0
to 0
bomb 0
a 0
bus 0
full 0
of 0
Jewish 1
tourists, 1
plunderers 1
of 1

The 0

In 0

So 0
which 0
is 0
it? 0

Does 0
Ramadan 0
remind 0
us 0
of 0
“the 0
richness 0
Muslims 0
add 0
to 0
the 1
religious 1
tapestry 1
of 1
American 1
life,” 1
or 0
is 0
Ramadan 0
“a 0
month 0
of 0
calamity 0
everywhere 0
for 0
nonbelievers”? 0

Islam’s 1
core 1
beliefs 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
latter 1
statement 1
is 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
truth. 1

During 0
Ramadan, 0
Muslims 0
are 0
exhorted 0
to 0
renew 0
and 0
deepen 0
their 0
devotion 0
to 0
Allah. 0

Hence 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
time 0
when 0
they’re 0
supposed 0
to 0
grow 0
more 0
generous 0
and 0
kind 0
toward 0
their 0
fellow 0
Muslims. 0

However, 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
says: 0
“Muhammad 0
is 0
the 0
Messenger 0
of 0
Allah, 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
with 0
him 0
are 0
severe 1
against 1
disbelievers, 0
and 0
merciful 0
among 0
themselves” 0
(48:29). 0

If 0
the 0
Ramadan 0
imperative 0
is 0
to 0
become 0
more 0
devout, 0
the 0
Muslim 0
who 0
applies 0
himself 0
diligently 0
to 0
the 0
Ramadan 0
observance 0
will 0
simultaneously 0
become 0
more 0
both 0
merciful 0
to 0
his 0
fellow 0
Muslims 0
and 0
more 1
severe 1
against 1
the 0
unbelievers. 0

Murdering 1
infidels 1
thus 1
doesn’t 1
contradict 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
Ramadan; 1
it 1
embodies 1
it. 1

The 0
Kavkaz 0
Center, 0
a 0
website 0
operated 0
by 0
Chechen 1
jihadists, 1
explained 0
in 0
a 0
2010 0
article 0
that 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
Ramadan 0
as 0
a 0
time 0
for 0
warfare 0
against 0
infidels 1
went 0
back 0
to 0
Muhammad’s 0
time: 0
“The 0
month 0
of 0
Ramadan 0
in 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
Prophet 0
(pbuh) 0
and 0
the 0
righteous 0
ancestors 0
was 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
forthcoming. 0

The 0
greatest 0
battles 0
during 0
the 0
lifetime 0
of 0
the 0
Prophet 0
(pbuh) 0
occurred 0
in 0
this 1
blessed 1
month, 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad, 1
zeal 0
and 0
enthusiasm.” 0

Trump 0
was, 0
unfortunately, 0
following 0
the 0
example 0
of 0
his 0
two 0
immediate 0
predecessors 0
when 0
he 0
claimed 0
that 0
“Ramadan 0
reminds 0
us 0
of 0
the 0
richness 0
Muslims 0
add 0
to 1
the 1
religious 1
tapestry 1
of 1
American 1
life,” 1
and 0
was 0
severely 1
misleading 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

Ironically, 0
even 0
in 0
doing 0
this 0
he 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
fail 0
to 0
satisfy 0
Muslims, 0
or 0
anyone. 0

After 0
all, 0
after 0
the 0
Trump 0
White 0
House 0
issued 0
a 0
similar 0
statement 0
last 0
year, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
ran 0
a 0
lengthy 0
piece 0
in 0
which 0
several 0
Muslims 0
explained 0
why 0
the 0
statement 0
was 0
unsatisfactory 0
to 0
them. 0

Shadi 0
Hamid 0
of 0
the 0
Qatar-funded 0
Brookings 0
Institution 0
declared: 0
“Trump 1
has 1
so 1
rarely 1
recognized 1
that 1
American 1
Muslims 1
even 1
exist, 1
but 1
this 1
offers 1
apparent 1
proof 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
aware 1
of 1
our 1
existence. 1

Great! 1

Putting 0
all 0
that 0
context 0
aside, 0
it’s 0
offensive 0
and 0
pretty 1
much 1
terrible.” 1

Why? 0

Because 0
Trump 0
had 0
the 0
temerity 0
to 0
mention 0
jihad 0
terrorism. 0

Hamid 0
continued: 0
“We, 0
as 0
American 0
Muslims, 0
shouldn’t 0
be 0
defined 0
solely 0
in 0
our 0
relationship 0
to 0
bad 0
things 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with. 0

We’re 0
also 0
normal 0
people 0
who 0
happen 0
to 0
be 0
Muslim 0
and 0
to 0
see 0
us 0
and 0
our 0
history 0
in 0
America 0
so 0
narrowly 0
is 0
plain 1
out 1
offensive.” 1

What 1
is 1
actually 1
offensive 1
is 1
that 1
Hamid 1
would 1
try 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
to 1
absolve 1
the 1
Muslim 1
community 1
of 1
any 1
responsibility 1
to 1
root 1
out 1
jihad 1
terrorist 1
from 1
its 1
midst. 1

There 0
is 0
certain 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
jihad 0
terrorism 0
during 0
this 0
Ramadan, 0
and 0
some 0
of 0
it 0
may 0
be 0
committed 0
by 0
Muslims 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Hamid, 1
if 1
he 1
cared 1
about 1
this, 1
would 1
be 1
confronting 1
honestly 1
the 1
teachings 1
of 1
Islam 1
that 1
make 1
Ramadan 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad, 1
and 1
working 1
to 1
reform 1
them. 1

Meanwhile, 0
it 1
would 1
be 1
dangerous, 1
suicidal 1
folly 1
for 1
Infidels 1
to 1
pretend 1
that 1
Ramadan 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad. 1

And 1
as 1
our 1
Ramadan 1
willful 1
blindness 1
continues, 1
more 1
Infidels 1
will 1
die. 1
