Every 1
other 1
Muslim 1
terrorist 1
or 0
killer 0
in 0
Europe 0
has 0
his 0
actions 0
blamed 0
on 0
mental 0
illness 0
or 0
drug 0
use. 0

This 0
just 0
continues 0
the 0
pattern. 0

I 0
wrote 0
about 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
Sarah 0
Halimi 0
last 0
year. 0

Sarah 0
Lucy 0
Halimi 0
was 0
thrown 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
the 0
third 0
floor 0
Paris 0
apartment 0
while 0
she 0
begged 0
her 0
Muslim 1
killer 1
to 0
spare 0
her 0
life. 0

The 0
66-year-old 0
director 0
of 0
an 0
Orthodox 0
Jewish 0
nursery 0
was 0
woken 0
from 0
her 0
sleep 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
violently 1
beaten 1
by 0
her 0
twenty 0
something 0
Muslim 0
neighbor 0
who 0
then 0
dragged 0
her 0
to 0
the 0
window. 0

She 0
died 0
on 0
the 0
street 0
outside 0
the 0
building 0
where 0
she 0
had 0
lived 0
for 0
thirty 0
years. 0

The 0
killer 0
had 0
allegedly 0
shouted, 0
“Allahu 0
Akbar”. 0

In 0
the 0
tragic 1
comedy 1
of 1
denial 1
that 0
every 1
Islamic 1
terrorism 1
investigation 1
inevitably 1
becomes, 1
the 0
authorities 0
are 0
still 0
hunting 0
around 0
for 0
his 0
motiv 0
Yonathan 0
Halimi, 0
Sarah 0
Lucy’s 0
son, 0
describes 0
the 0
killer’s 0
family 0
as 0
being 0
known 0
for 0
its 0
anti-Semitism. 0

"One 0
day, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
killer's 0
sisters 0
pushed 0
my 0
sister 0
down 0
the 0
stairs, 0
and 0
the 0
next 0
time 0
she 0
called 0
her 0
a 0
dirty 1
Jew," 1
he 0
described. 0

Sarah’s 0
brother 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
killer 0
called 0
Sarah 0
and 0
her 0
daughter, 0
“dirty 1
Jews”. 1

The 0
authorities 0
stonewalled 1
at 0
every 0
turn. 0

And, 0
predictably, 0
the 0
killer 0
gets 0
a 0
pass. 0

Allahu 0
Akbar 0
usually 0
means 0
motive 0
unknown. 0

The 0
28-year-old 0
Muslim 0
man 0
confessed 0
to 0
the 0
killing 0
and 0
was 0
heard 0
shouting 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar” 1
and 0
calling 0
Halimi 0
“Satan” 1
shortly 0
before 0
throwing 0
her 0
out 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
her 0
three-story 0
apartment. 0

In 0
January, 0
Traore 0
was 0
determined 0
to 0
be 0
fit 0
to 0
stand 0
trial. 0

He 0
was 0
placed 0
in 0
a 0
psychiatric 0
hospital 0
for 0
weeks 0
after 0
his 0
arrest 0
in 0
the 0
April 0
2017 0
killing 0
despite 0
having 0
no 0
history 0
of 0
mental 0
illness. 0

But 0
a 0
judge 0
requested 0
a 0
second 0
series 0
of 0
tests, 0
which 0
determined 0
that 0
the 0
Malian 0
immigrant 0
was 0
not 0
able 0
to 0
stand 0
trial, 0
20 0
Minutes 0
reported 0
Wednesday. 0

This 0
tired 1
farce 1
has 0
dragged 0
on. 0

Kobili 0
Traore 0
was 0
hit 1
with 0
hate 0
crimes 0
charges. 0

Then 0
they 0
were 0
dropped. 0

The 1
authorities 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
commit 1
the 1
crime. 1

Now 0
they're 0
letting 0
him 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
it. 0

Three 0
minutes 0
later, 0
a 0
unit 0
of 0
the 0
Anti-Crime 0
Brigade 0
(BAC) 0
— 0
who 0
happened 0
to 0
be 0
patrolling 0
the 0
area 0
— 0
took 0
up 0
position 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
Diara’s 0
door. 0

They 0
heard 0
Kobili 0
Traore 0
chanting 0
Muslim 0
prayers 0
and 0
Koranic 0
verses. 0

Unsure 0
about 0
the 0
situation 0
and 0
the 0
potential 0
threats 0
to 0
the 0
family, 0
they 0
asked 0
for 0
reinforcements. 0

Additional 0
policemen 0
arrived 0
quickly. 0

However, 0
for 0
some 0
unclear 0
reason, 0
the 0
BAC 0
unit 0
still 0
refrained 0
from 0
breaking 0
in. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Kobili 0
Traore 0
put 0
on 0
new 0
clothes 0
and 0
climbed 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window 0
to 0
reach 0
Sarah 0
Halimi’s 0
apartment, 0
which 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
level 0
as 0
Diara 0
Traore’s. 0

He 0
allegedly 0
assaulted 0
the 0
Jewish 0
woman 0
and 0
hit 1
her 1
mercilessly. 1

From 0
time 0
to 0
time 0
he 0
resumed 0
Koranic 0
recitation. 0

Many 0
neighbours, 0
woken 0
by 0
the 0
old 0
woman’s 0
screams 0
or 0
the 0
assaulter’s 0
religious 0
chanting, 0
called 0
the 0
police 0
Some 0
gave 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
exact 0
location 0
of 0
the 0
assault, 0
the 0
attacker’s 0
identity, 0
the 0
fact 0
he 0
vilified 0
his 0
victim 0
as 0
a 0
Jewish 0
person 0
and 0
as 0
“a 1
Satan” 1
while 0
hitting 0
her, 0
or 0
even 0
— 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
Muslim 0
neighbours 0
were 0
concerned 0
— 0
the 0
Koranic 0
portions 0
he 0
chanted. 0

Yet 0
the 0
police 0
still 0
failed 0
to 0
storm 0
Sarah 0
Halimi’s 0
apartment 0
and 0
rescue 0
her. 0

Eventually, 0
Kobili 0
Traore 0
is 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
shouted 0
that 0
the 0
woman 0
was 0
“mad 0
and 0
about 0
to 0
commit 0
suicide”, 0
and 0
threw 0
her 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window. 0

He 0
had 0
time 0
enough 0
to 0
climb 0
back 0
to 0
Diara 0
Traore’s 0
apartment 0
where 0
he 0
finally 0
was 0
arrested. 0

His 0
hands 0
were 0
covered 0
in 0
blood. 0

There 0
was 0
blood 0
everywhere 0
in 0
his 0
victim’s 0
apartment. 0

Sure 0
he 0
was 0
crazy. 1

So 0
crazy 0
he 0
tried 0
to 0
contrive 0
an 0
alibi 0
for 0
his 0
crime. 0

Kobili 0
isn't 0
crazy. 1

But 0
the 0
system 0
that 0
keeps 0
on 0
protecting 0
him 0
is. 0
