as 0 235 8
being 0 235 8

"One 0 235 9
day, 0 235 9
one 0 235 9
of 0 235 9
the 0 235 9
killer's 0 235 9
sisters 0 235 9

my 0 235 9
sister 0 235 9
down 0 235 9
the 0 235 9

and 0 235 9
the 0 235 9
next 0 235 9
time 0 235 9
she 0 235 9
called 0 235 9
her 0 235 9
a 0 235 9
dirty 1 235 9
Jew," 1 235 9
he 0 235 9
described. 0 235 9

Sarah’s 0 235 10
brother 0 235 10
said 0 235 10
that 0 235 10
the 0 235 10
killer 0 235 10
called 0 235 10
Sarah 0 235 10

her 0 235 10

“dirty 1 235 10
Jews”. 1 235 10

The 0 235 11
authorities 0 235 11
stonewalled 1 235 11
at 0 235 11
every 0 235 11
turn. 0 235 11

And, 0 235 12
predictably, 0 235 12
the 0 235 12
killer 0 235 12
gets 0 235 12
a 0 235 12
pass. 0 235 12

Allahu 0 235 13

The 0 235 14
28-year-old 0 235 14
Muslim 0 235 14
man 0 235 14
confessed 0 235 14
to 0 235 14
the 0 235 14
killing 0 235 14
and 0 235 14
was 0 235 14
heard 0 235 14
shouting 0 235 14
“Allahu 1 235 14
Akbar” 1 235 14
and 0 235 14
calling 0 235 14
Halimi 0 235 14
“Satan” 1 235 14
shortly 0 235 14
before 0 235 14

her 0 235 14
out 0 235 14
the 0 235 14
window 0 235 14
of 0 235 14
her 0 235 14
three-story 0 235 14
apartment. 0 235 14

In 0 235 15
January, 0 235 15
Traore 0 235 15
was 0 235 15
determined 0 235 15
to 0 235 15
be 0 235 15
fit 0 235 15
to 0 235 15
stand 0 235 15
trial. 0 235 15

He 0 235 16
was 0 235 16
placed 0 235 16
in 0 235 16
a 0 235 16
psychiatric 0 235 16
hospital 0 235 16
for 0 235 16
weeks 0 235 16
after 0 235 16
his 0 235 16
arrest 0 235 16
in 0 235 16
the 0 235 16
April 0 235 16
2017 0 235 16
killing 0 235 16
despite 0 235 16
having 0 235 16
no 0 235 16
history 0 235 16
of 0 235 16
mental 0 235 16
illness. 0 235 16

But 0 235 17
a 0 235 17
judge 0 235 17
requested 0 235 17
a 0 235 17
second 0 235 17
series 0 235 17
of 0 235 17
tests, 0 235 17
which 0 235 17
determined 0 235 17
that 0 235 17
the 0 235 17
Malian 0 235 17
immigrant 0 235 17
was 0 235 17
not 0 235 17
able 0 235 17
to 0 235 17
stand 0 235 17
trial, 0 235 17
20 0 235 17
Minutes 0 235 17
reported 0 235 17
Wednesday. 0 235 17

This 0 235 18
tired 1 235 18
farce 1 235 18
has 0 235 18
dragged 0 235 18
on. 0 235 18

Kobili 0 235 19
Traore 0 235 19
was 0 235 19
hit 1 235 19
with 0 235 19
hate 0 235 19
crimes 0 235 19
charges. 0 235 19

Then 0 235 20
they 0 235 20
were 0 235 20
dropped. 0 235 20

The 1 235 21
authorities 1 235 21
allowed 1 235 21
him 1 235 21
to 1 235 21
commit 1 235 21
the 1 235 21
crime. 1 235 21

Now 0 235 22
they're 0 235 22
letting 0 235 22
him 0 235 22
get 0 235 22
away 0 235 22
with 0 235 22
it. 0 235 22

Three 0 235 23
minutes 0 235 23
later, 0 235 23
a 0 235 23
unit 0 235 23
of 0 235 23
the 0 235 23
Anti-Crime 0 235 23
Brigade 0 235 23
(BAC) 0 235 23
— 0 235 23
who 0 235 23
happened 0 235 23
to 0 235 23
be 0 235 23
patrolling 0 235 23
the 0 235 23
area 0 235 23
— 0 235 23
took 0 235 23
up 0 235 23
position 0 235 23
in 0 235 23
front 0 235 23
of 0 235 23
Diara’s 0 235 23
door. 0 235 23

They 0 235 24
heard 0 235 24
Kobili 0 235 24
Traore 0 235 24
chanting 0 235 24
Muslim 0 235 24
prayers 0 235 24
and 0 235 24
Koranic 0 235 24
verses. 0 235 24

Unsure 0 235 25
about 0 235 25
the 0 235 25
situation 0 235 25
and 0 235 25
the 0 235 25
potential 0 235 25
threats 0 235 25
to 0 235 25
the 0 235 25
family, 0 235 25
they 0 235 25
asked 0 235 25
for 0 235 25
reinforcements. 0 235 25

Additional 0 235 26
policemen 0 235 26
arrived 0 235 26
quickly. 0 235 26

However, 0 235 27
for 0 235 27
some 0 235 27
unclear 0 235 27
reason, 0 235 27
the 0 235 27
BAC 0 235 27
unit 0 235 27
still 0 235 27
refrained 0 235 27
from 0 235 27
breaking 0 235 27
in. 0 235 27

In 0 235 28
the 0 235 28
meantime, 0 235 28
Kobili 0 235 28
Traore 0 235 28
put 0 235 28
on 0 235 28
new 0 235 28
clothes 0 235 28
and 0 235 28
climbed 0 235 28
out 0 235 28
of 0 235 28
the 0 235 28
window 0 235 28
to 0 235 28
reach 0 235 28
Sarah 0 235 28
Halimi’s 0 235 28
apartment, 0 235 28
which 0 235 28
was 0 235 28
at 0 235 28
the 0 235 28
same 0 235 28
level 0 235 28
as 0 235 28
Diara 0 235 28
Traore’s. 0 235 28

He 0 235 29
allegedly 0 235 29
assaulted 0 235 29
the 0 235 29
Jewish 0 235 29
woman 0 235 29
and 0 235 29
hit 1 235 29
her 1 235 29
mercilessly. 1 235 29

From 0 235 30
time 0 235 30
to 0 235 30
time 0 235 30
he 0 235 30
resumed 0 235 30
Koranic 0 235 30
recitation. 0 235 30

Many 0 235 31
neighbours, 0 235 31
woken 0 235 31
by 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
old 0 235 31
woman’s 0 235 31
screams 0 235 31
or 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
assaulter’s 0 235 31
religious 0 235 31
chanting, 0 235 31
called 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
police 0 235 31
Some 0 235 31
gave 0 235 31
details 0 235 31
about 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
exact 0 235 31
location 0 235 31
of 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
assault, 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
attacker’s 0 235 31
identity, 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
fact 0 235 31
he 0 235 31
vilified 0 235 31
his 0 235 31
victim 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
a 0 235 31
Jewish 0 235 31
person 0 235 31
and 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
“a 1 235 31
Satan” 1 235 31
while 0 235 31
hitting 0 235 31
her, 0 235 31
or 0 235 31
even 0 235 31
— 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
far 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
Muslim 0 235 31
neighbours 0 235 31
were 0 235 31
concerned 0 235 31
— 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
Koranic 0 235 31
portions 0 235 31
he 0 235 31
chanted. 0 235 31

Yet 0 235 32
the 0 235 32
police 0 235 32
still 0 235 32
failed 0 235 32
to 0 235 32
storm 0 235 32
Sarah 0 235 32
Halimi’s 0 235 32
apartment 0 235 32
and 0 235 32
rescue 0 235 32
her. 0 235 32

Eventually, 0 235 33
Kobili 0 235 33
Traore 0 235 33
is 0 235 33
claimed 0 235 33
to 0 235 33
have 0 235 33
shouted 0 235 33
that 0 235 33
the 0 235 33
woman 0 235 33
was 0 235 33
“mad 0 235 33
and 0 235 33
about 0 235 33
to 0 235 33
commit 0 235 33
suicide”, 0 235 33
and 0 235 33
threw 0 235 33
her 0 235 33
out 0 235 33
of 0 235 33
the 0 235 33
window. 0 235 33

He 0 235 34
had 0 235 34
time 0 235 34
enough 0 235 34
to 0 235 34
climb 0 235 34
back 0 235 34
to 0 235 34
Diara 0 235 34
Traore’s 0 235 34
apartment 0 235 34
where 0 235 34
he 0 235 34
finally 0 235 34
was 0 235 34
arrested. 0 235 34

His 0 235 35
hands 0 235 35
were 0 235 35
covered 0 235 35
in 0 235 35
blood. 0 235 35

There 0 235 36
was 0 235 36
blood 0 235 36
everywhere 0 235 36
in 0 235 36
his 0 235 36
victim’s 0 235 36
apartment. 0 235 36

Sure 0 235 37
he 0 235 37
was 0 235 37
crazy. 1 235 37

So 0 235 38
crazy 0 235 38
he 0 235 38
tried 0 235 38
to 0 235 38
contrive 0 235 38
an 0 235 38
alibi 0 235 38
for 0 235 38
his 0 235 38
crime. 0 235 38

Kobili 0 235 39
isn't 0 235 39
crazy. 1 235 39

But 0 235 40
the 0 235 40
system 0 235 40
that 0 235 40
keeps 0 235 40
on 0 235 40
protecting 0 235 40
him 0 235 40
is. 0 235 40
