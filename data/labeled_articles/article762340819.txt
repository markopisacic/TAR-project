Obama’s 0
Treason: 1
Even 1
Worse 1
Than 0
We 0
Thought 0

The 0
Washington 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
reported 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
“the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
skirted 0
key 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
to 0
grant 0
Iran 0
access 0
to 0
billions 0
in 0
hard 0
currency 0
despite 0
public 0
assurances 0
the 0
administration 0
was 0
engaged 0
in 0
no 0
such 0
action, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
congressional 0
investigation.” 0

And 0
it 0
gets 0
even 1
worse: 1
“The 0
investigation, 0
published 0
Wednesday 0
by 0
the 0
House 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigations, 0
further 0
discloses 0
secret 0
efforts 0
by 0
top 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
to 0
assure 0
European 0
countries 0
they 0
would 0
receive 0
a 0
pass 0
from 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
if 0
they 0
engaged 0
in 0
business 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

This 0
revelation 0
comes 0
after 0
the 0
news 0
that 0
came 0
to 0
light 0
in 0
February, 0
that, 0
according 0
to 0
Bill 0
Gertz 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Times, 0
“the 0
U.S. 0
government 0
has 0
traced 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
$1.7 0
billion 0
released 0
to 0
Iran 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
to 0
Iranian-backed 0
terrorists 0
in 0
the 0
two 0
years 0
since 0
the 0
cash 0
was 0
transferred.” 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
law 0
that 0
applies 0
to 0
this 0
situation. 0

U.S. 0
Code 0
2381 0
says: 0
“Whoever, 0
owing 0
allegiance 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
levies 0
war 0
against 0
them 0
or 0
adheres 0
to 0
their 0
enemies, 0
giving 0
them 0
aid 0
and 0
comfort 0
within 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
elsewhere, 0
is 0
guilty 0
of 0
treason 1
and 0
shall 0
suffer 0
death, 0
or 0
shall 0
be 0
imprisoned 0
not 0
less 0
than 0
five 0
years 0
and 0
fined 0
under 0
this 0
title 0
but 0
not 0
less 0
than 0
$10,000; 0
and 0
shall 0
be 0
incapable 0
of 0
holding 0
any 0
office 0
under 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0

In 0
a 0
sane 0
political 0
environment, 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
would 0
be 0
tried 0
for 0
treason. 1

Barack 0
Hussein 0
Obama 0
has 0
planted 0
seeds 0
that 0
will 0
be 0
bearing 0
bitter 0
fruit 0
for 1
years, 1
and 1
probably 1
decades, 1
to 0
come. 0

He 0
is, 0
without 0
any 0
doubt, 0
the 1
worst 1
President 0
in 0
American 0
history. 0

Fillmore, 0
Pierce, 0
Buchanan? 0

Yes, 0
the 0
doughface 0
Presidents 0
made 0
the 0
Civil 0
War 0
inevitable, 0
but 0
worse 0
came 0
later. 0

Grant? 0

Blind 1
to 1
corruption 1
and 0
out 0
of 0
his 0
depth, 0
but 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
worse 0
than 0
he 0
as 0
well. 0

Wilson? 0

That 0
black-hearted 1
Presbyterian 1
bigot 1
arguably 0
gave 0
the 0
world 0
Hitler 0
and 0
World 0
War 0
II, 0
so 0
he 0
is 0
definitely 0
in 0
the 0
Final 0
Four. 0

Harding? 0

Nah: 0
his 0
tax 0
cuts 0
and 0
return 0
to 0
“normalcy” 0
got 0
the 0
American 0
economy, 0
and 0
the 0
Twenties, 0
roaring. 0

FDR 0
and 0
LBJ 0
gave 0
us 0
the 0
modern 0
welfare 0
state 0
and 0
dependent 0
classes 0
automatically 0
voting 0
Democrat; 0
the 0
full 0
bill 0
on 0
the 0
damage 0
they 0
did 0
hasn’t 0
yet 0
been 0
presented. 0

Nixon? 0

A 0
crook 1
and 1
an 1
economic 1
Leftist, 1
who 0
betrayed 0
Taiwan 0
for 0
the 0
People’s 0
Republic; 0
his 0
record 0
certainly 0
isn’t 0
good. 0

Carter? 0

Nothing 1
good 1
can 0
be 0
said 0
about 0
his 0
four 0
years 0
of 0
sanctimony 0
and 0
incompetence. 0

But 0
there 0
is 0
one 0
thing 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
has 0
on 0
all 0
competitors: 0
treason. 1

He 0
showered 0
hundreds 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
on 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran. 0

There 0
are 0
those 0
who 0
say, 0
“It 0
was 0
their 0
money. 0

It 0
belonged 0
to 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government 0
but 0
was 0
frozen 0
and 0
not 0
paid 0
since 0
1979.” 0
Indeed, 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
reason 0
for 0
that: 0
not 0
even 0
Jimmy 0
Carter, 0
who 0
made 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran 0
possible, 0
thought 0
that 0
money, 0
which 0
had 0
been 0
paid 0
by 0
the 0
Shah’s 0
government 0
in 0
a 0
canceled 0
arms 0
deal, 0
belonged 0
to 0
the 0
mullahs 0
who 0
overthrew 0
the 0
Shah. 0

Likewise 0
Reagan, 0
George 0
H. 0
W. 0
Bush, 0
Clinton, 0
and 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
all 0
thought 0
that 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
was 0
not 0
due 0
money 0
that 0
was 0
owed 0
to 0
the 0
Shah. 0

Only 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
did. 0

The 0
definition 0
of 0
treason 1
is 0
giving 0
aid 0
and 0
comfort 0
to 0
the 0
enemy. 0

The 0
leaders 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran 0
order 0
their 0
people 0
to 0
chant 0
“Death 1
to 1
America” 1
in 0
mosques 0
every 0
Friday, 0
and 0
repeatedly 0
vow 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
ultimately 0
destroy 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
and 0
the 0
state 0
of 0
Israel. 0

How 0
was 0
giving 0
them 0
billions 0
and 0
helping 0
them 0
skirt 0
sanctions 0
applied 0
by 0
the 0
U.S. 0
government 0
not 0
treason? 1

Other 0
Presidents 0
have 0
been 0
incompetent, 1
corrupt, 1
dishonest, 1
but 0
which 0
has 0
committed 0
treason 1
on 0
a 0
scale 0
to 0
rival 0
the 0
treason 1
of 0
Barack 0
Obama? 0

The 0
Iranians 0
also 0
operate 0
a 0
global 0
network 0
of 0
jihad 0
terror 0
organizations, 0
one 0
of 0
which, 0
Hizballah, 0
is 0
quite 0
active 0
in 0
Mexico 0
now, 0
with 0
the 0
obvious 0
ultimate 0
intention 0
of 0
crossing 0
the 0
border 0
and 0
committing 1
jihad 1
massacres 1
of 1
Americans. 1

Obama 0
has 0
given 0
a 0
tremendous 1
boost 0
to 0
these 0
initiatives, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
program, 0
with 0
his 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
that 0
has 0
given 0
the 0
Iranians 0
hundreds 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
and 0
essentially 0
a 0
green 0
light 0
to 0
manufacture 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
in 0
exchange 0
for 0
absolutely 0
nothing. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
telling 0
when 0
the 0
worst 0
consequences 0
of 0
Obama’s 0
aid 0
and 0
comfort 0
to 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran 0
will 0
be 0
felt. 0

But 0
they 0
likely 0
will 0
be 0
felt 0
in 0
one 0
way 0
or 0
another. 0

Even 0
as 0
President 0
Trump 0
moves 0
swiftly 0
to 0
restore 0
sanctions 0
and 0
put 0
Iran 0
on 0
notice 0
that 0
its 0
nuclear 0
activity 0
and 0
global 0
adventurism 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
tolerated, 0
those 0
billions 0
cannot 0
be 0
recovered, 0
and 0
the 0
Iranians 0
have 0
already 0
spent 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
for 0
their 0
jihad 0
cause. 0

However 0
this 0
catastrophe 1
plays 0
out, 0
there 0
is 0
one 0
man 0
who 0
will 0
suffer 0
no 0
consequences 0
whatsoever: 0
Barack 0
Obama. 0

That’s 0
Leftist 0
Privilege. 0

It’s 0
good 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
powerful 0
Leftist 0
in 0
Washington 0
nowadays. 0

Laws? 0

Pah! 0

Laws 0
are 0
for 0
conservatives. 0
