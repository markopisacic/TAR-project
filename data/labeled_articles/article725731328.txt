Some 0
Farrakhan 0
quotes: 0

“The 0
Jews 0
don’t 0
like 0
Farrakhan, 0
so 0
they 0
call 0
me 0
Hitler. 0

Well, 0
that’s 1
a 1
good 1
name. 1

Hitler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
man.” 1

“My 1
god 1
will 1
wipe 1
this 1
country 1
(America) 1
from 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth.” 1

On 0
on 0
the 0
Jewish 0
people: 0
“You 1
are 1
wicked 1
deceivers 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

You 1
have 1
sucked 1
their 1
blood.” 1

“The 1
Jews 1
don’t 1
like 1
Farrakhan, 1
so 1
they 1
call 1
me 1
Hitler. 1

Well, 0
that’s 1
a 1
good 1
name. 1

Hitler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
man.” 1

“You 0
are 0
not 0
now, 0
nor 0
have 0
you 0
ever 0
been 0
a 0
citizen 0
of 0
America. 0

You 0
are 0
a 0
slave 0

“America 1

and 1
I 1
say 1
God 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
wipe 1
this 1
nation 1
from 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
Earth. 1

I’m 1
not 1
crazy, 1
I’m 1
not 1
drunk, 1
how 1
long 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
a 1
nation 1
can 1
do 1
evil 1
and 1
not 1
face 1
the 1
wrath 1
of 1
god?” 1

“You 0
see 0
everybody 0
always 0
talk 0
about 0
Hitler 1
exterminating 1
six 1
million 1
Jews. 1

That’s 0
right. 0

But 1
don’t 1
nobody 1
ever 1
ask 1
what 1
did 1
they 1
do 1
to 1
Hitler.” 1
