Senator 0 90 1
Rand 0 90 1
Paul 0 90 1
(R-KY) 0 90 1
has 0 90 1
expressed 0 90 1
some 0 90 1
of 0 90 1
my 0 90 1
thoughts 0 90 1
when 0 90 1
it 0 90 1
comes 0 90 1
to 0 90 1
the 0 90 1
newly 0 90 1
nominated 0 90 1
Secretary 0 90 1
of 0 90 1
State 0 90 1
and 0 90 1
director 0 90 1
of 0 90 1
the 0 90 1
Central 0 90 1
Intelligence 0 90 1
Agency. 0 90 1

Paul 0 90 2
told 0 90 2
CNN’s 0 90 2
“State 0 90 2
of 0 90 2
the 0 90 2
Union” 0 90 2
and 0 90 2
CBS 0 90 2
News’ 0 90 2
“Face 0 90 2
the 0 90 2
Nation” 0 90 2
on 0 90 2
Sunday 0 90 2
that 0 90 2
he 0 90 2
would 0 90 2
do 0 90 2
"whatever 0 90 2
it 0 90 2
takes," 0 90 2
including 0 90 2
a 0 90 2
filibuster, 0 90 2
to 0 90 2
block 0 90 2
the 0 90 2
confirmations 0 90 2
of 0 90 2
Mike 0 90 2
Pompeo 0 90 2
to 0 90 2
head 0 90 2
the 0 90 2
State 0 90 2
Department 0 90 2
and 0 90 2
Gina 0 90 2
Haspel 0 90 2
to 0 90 2
run 0 90 2
the 0 90 2
CIA. 0 90 2

“You 1 90 3
really 1 90 3
want 1 90 3
a 1 90 3
diplomat 1 90 3
to 1 90 3
be 1 90 3
in 1 90 3
charge 1 90 3
of 1 90 3
the 1 90 3
State 1 90 3
Department, 1 90 3
not 1 90 3
someone 1 90 3
who 1 90 3
is 1 90 3
advocating 1 90 3
for 1 90 3
war,” 1 90 3
he 0 90 3
told 0 90 3
“Face 0 90 3
the 0 90 3
Nation.” 0 90 3

“I 0 90 4
frankly 0 90 4
think 0 90 4
that 0 90 4
Pompeo’s 0 90 4
positions 0 90 4
are 0 90 4
too 0 90 4
much 0 90 4
of 0 90 4
an 0 90 4
advocate 0 90 4
for 0 90 4
regime 0 90 4
change, 0 90 4
really 0 90 4
everywhere,” 0 90 4
he 0 90 4
added. 0 90 4

"I 0 90 5
don't 0 90 5
think 0 90 5
our 0 90 5
policy 0 90 5
ought 0 90 5
to 0 90 5
be 0 90 5
for 0 90 5
regime 0 90 5
change, 0 90 5
so 0 90 5
I 0 90 5
think 0 90 5
Pompeo 1 90 5
really 1 90 5
isn't 1 90 5
a 1 90 5
good 1 90 5
fit 1 90 5
to 1 90 5
be 1 90 5
a 1 90 5
diplomat." 1 90 5

He's 0 90 6
right, 0 90 6
too. 0 90 6

Pompeo 0 90 7
has 0 90 7
advocated 0 90 7
for 0 90 7
regime 0 90 7
change 0 90 7
in 0 90 7
North 0 90 7
Korea. 0 90 7

We've 0 90 8
seen 0 90 8
exactly 0 90 8
what 0 90 8
happens 0 90 8
when 0 90 8
the 0 90 8
US 0 90 8
gets 0 90 8
involved 0 90 8
in 0 90 8
such 0 90 8
types 0 90 8
of 0 90 8
regime 0 90 8
changes, 0 90 8
and 0 90 8
the 0 90 8
truth 0 90 8
is 0 90 8
that 0 90 8
they 0 90 8
really 0 90 8
don't 0 90 8
work 0 90 8
out 0 90 8
too 0 90 8
well. 0 90 8

As 0 90 9
for 0 90 9
Haspel, 0 90 9
Paul 0 90 9
told 0 90 9
"Face 0 90 9
The 0 90 9
Nation," 0 90 9
"She 0 90 9
oversaw 0 90 9
an 0 90 9
illegal 0 90 9
black 0 90 9
ops 0 90 9
operation 0 90 9
in 0 90 9
Thailand 0 90 9
that 0 90 9
included 0 90 9
torture. 0 90 9

I 1 90 10
don't 1 90 10
think 1 90 10
torture 1 90 10
is 1 90 10
what 1 90 10
America 1 90 10
is 1 90 10
about." 1 90 10

On 0 90 11
"State 0 90 11
of 0 90 11
the 0 90 11
Union," 0 90 11
Paul 0 90 11
added, 0 90 11
"I'll 0 90 11
do 0 90 11
whatever 0 90 11
it 0 90 11
takes, 0 90 11
and 0 90 11
that 0 90 11
includes 0 90 11
filibuster" 0 90 11
to 0 90 11
block 0 90 11
their 0 90 11
confirmation. 0 90 11

"I 0 90 12
don't 0 90 12
have 0 90 12
the 0 90 12
power 0 90 12
to 0 90 12
stop 0 90 12
her 0 90 12
nomination," 0 90 12
he 0 90 12
said 0 90 12
of 0 90 12
Haspel. 0 90 12

"There's 0 90 13
enough 0 90 13
votes 0 90 13
she'll 0 90 13
eventually 0 90 13
win. 0 90 13

Few 1 90 14
things 1 90 14
in 1 90 14
life 1 90 14
. 1 90 14

. 1 90 15

. 1 90 16

[are] 1 90 17
worth 1 90 17
standing 1 90 17
up 1 90 17
saying 0 90 17
'enough 1 90 17
is 1 90 17
enough.'" 1 90 17

"We 1 90 18
are 1 90 18
not 1 90 18
a 1 90 18
people 1 90 18
that 1 90 18
should 1 90 18
be 1 90 18
so 1 90 18
fearful 1 90 18
or 1 90 18
vengeful 1 90 18
that 1 90 18
we 1 90 18
think 1 90 18
that 1 90 18
torture 1 90 18
is 1 90 18
somehow 1 90 18
acceptable," 1 90 18
he 0 90 18
added. 0 90 18

"On 0 90 19
what 0 90 19
level 0 90 19
could 0 90 19
torture 0 90 19
ever 0 90 19
be 0 90 19
acceptable? 0 90 19

We 1 90 20
should 1 90 20
make 1 90 20
a 1 90 20
stand 1 90 20
on 1 90 20
this. 1 90 20

She 1 90 21
should 1 90 21
never 1 90 21
lead 1 90 21
the 1 90 21
CIA." 1 90 21

Both 0 90 22
nominations 0 90 22
may 0 90 22
face 0 90 22
tough 0 90 22
confirmation 0 90 22
hearings, 0 90 22
but 0 90 22
it 0 90 22
seems 0 90 22
that 0 90 22
many 1 90 22
Americans 1 90 22
are 1 90 22
just 1 90 22
fine 1 90 22
with 1 90 22
these 1 90 22
types 1 90 22
of 1 90 22
people 1 90 22
being 1 90 22
in 1 90 22
these 1 90 22
types 1 90 22
of 1 90 22
offices. 1 90 22

The 0 90 23
only 0 90 23
thing 0 90 23
I 0 90 23
can 0 90 23
think 0 90 23
for 0 90 23
that 0 90 23
kind 0 90 23
of 0 90 23
reasoning 0 90 23
is 0 90 23
that 0 90 23
people 1 90 23
do 1 90 23
not 1 90 23
know 1 90 23
their 1 90 23
Constitution 1 90 23
and 1 90 23
understand 1 90 23
exactly 1 90 23
what 1 90 23
Senator 1 90 23
Paul 1 90 23
is 1 90 23
trying 1 90 23
to 1 90 23
warn 1 90 23
America 1 90 23
about. 1 90 23

Instead, 0 90 24
people 0 90 24
are 0 90 24
acting 0 90 24
out 0 90 24
of 0 90 24
emotion 0 90 24
and 0 90 24
fear. 0 90 24

Do 0 90 25
I 0 90 25
believe 0 90 25
we 0 90 25
should 0 90 25
be 0 90 25
concerned 0 90 25
about 0 90 25
North 0 90 25
Korea? 0 90 25

Sure, 0 90 26
but 0 90 26
I'm 0 90 26
hardly 0 90 26
worried 0 90 26
that 0 90 26
they 0 90 26
will 0 90 26
actually 0 90 26
attack 0 90 26
us. 0 90 26

Am 0 90 27
I 0 90 27
concerned 0 90 27
about 0 90 27
jihadis? 0 90 27

Yep, 0 90 28
but 0 90 28
I'm 0 90 28
not 0 90 28
sure 0 90 28
I've 0 90 28
seen 0 90 28
any 0 90 28
real 0 90 28
hard 0 90 28
evidence 0 90 28
that 0 90 28
torturing 0 90 28
them 0 90 28
has 0 90 28
produced 0 90 28
any 0 90 28
information 0 90 28
that 0 90 28
has 0 90 28
led 0 90 28
to 0 90 28
stopping 0 90 28
terror 0 90 28
attacks. 0 90 28

And 0 90 29
before 0 90 29
you 0 90 29
tell 0 90 29
me 0 90 29
about 0 90 29
the 0 90 29
media 0 90 29
reports 0 90 29
and 0 90 29
CIA 0 90 29
involvement, 0 90 29
just 0 90 29
keep 0 90 29
in 0 90 29
mind 0 90 29
that 0 90 29
a 1 90 29
former 1 90 29
journalist, 1 90 29
who 1 90 29
is 1 90 29
now 1 90 29
dead, 1 90 29
told 1 90 29
the 1 90 29
world 1 90 29
that 1 90 29
the 1 90 29
media 1 90 29
lies 1 90 29
for 1 90 29
the 1 90 29
CIA. 1 90 29

So, 1 90 30
I'm 1 90 30
wary 1 90 30
of 1 90 30
media 1 90 30
reports 1 90 30
that 1 90 30
claim 1 90 30
there 1 90 30
have 1 90 30
been 1 90 30
results 1 90 30
from 1 90 30
the 1 90 30
tactics 1 90 30
used. 1 90 30

Trump 1 90 31
has 1 90 31
obviously 1 90 31
had 1 90 31
praise 1 90 31
for 1 90 31
both 1 90 31
Pompeo 1 90 31
and 1 90 31
Haspel, 1 90 31
but 1 90 31
then 1 90 31
again, 1 90 31
his 1 90 31
administration 1 90 31
has 1 90 31
quite 1 90 31
a 1 90 31
bit 1 90 31
of 1 90 31
turn 1 90 31
over 1 90 31
too. 1 90 31

Mike 0 90 32
Pompeo, 0 90 32
Director 0 90 32
of 0 90 32
the 0 90 32
CIA, 0 90 32
will 0 90 32
become 0 90 32
our 0 90 32
new 0 90 32
Secretary 0 90 32
of 0 90 32
State. 0 90 32

He 1 90 33
will 1 90 33
do 1 90 33
a 1 90 33
fantastic 1 90 33
job! 1 90 33

Thank 0 90 34
you 0 90 34
to 0 90 34
Rex 0 90 34
Tillerson 0 90 34
for 0 90 34
his 0 90 34
service! 0 90 34

Gina 0 90 35
Haspel 0 90 35
will 0 90 35
become 0 90 35
the 0 90 35
new 0 90 35
Director 0 90 35
of 0 90 35
the 0 90 35
CIA, 0 90 35
and 0 90 35
the 0 90 35
first 0 90 35
woman 0 90 35
so 0 90 35
chosen. 0 90 35
