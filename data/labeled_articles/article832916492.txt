no 0 397 1

“He’s 1 397 2
been 1 397 2
vindicated 1 397 2
by 0 397 2
them,” 0 397 2
Evan 0 397 2

and 0 397 2
the 0 397 2

“And 0 397 3
then 0 397 3
he’s 0 397 3
now 0 397 3
vindicated, 1 397 3
exactly,” 0 397 3
Gloria 0 397 3
Borger 0 397 3
said. 0 397 3

“You 0 397 4
know–how 0 397 4
do 0 397 4
you 0 397 4
manage 0 397 4
that 0 397 4
politically? 0 397 4

I 0 397 5
mean, 0 397 5
we 0 397 5
obviously 0 397 5
can’t 0 397 5
jump 1 397 5
the 1 397 5
gun 1 397 5
here. 0 397 5

We 0 397 6
have 0 397 6
to 0 397 6
see 0 397 6
what 0 397 6
comes 0 397 6
out 0 397 6
from 0 397 6
Barr, 0 397 6
and 0 397 6
what’s 0 397 6
in 0 397 6
the 0 397 6
report. 0 397 6

But 0 397 7
if 0 397 7
I’m 0 397 7
at 0 397 7
Mar-A-Lago 0 397 7
with 0 397 7
the 0 397 7
president, 0 397 7
as 0 397 7
Pamela 0 397 7
has 0 397 7
been 0 397 7
reporting, 0 397 7
the 0 397 7
lawyers 0 397 7
are 0 397 7
… 0 397 7
that 0 397 7
I 0 397 7
would 0 397 7
be 0 397 7
very 0 397 7
happy,” 0 397 7
she 0 397 7
added. 0 397 7

Later, 0 397 8
a 0 397 8
panel 0 397 8
member 0 397 8
concluded 0 397 8
that 0 397 8
the 0 397 8
Mueller 0 397 8

a 0 397 8
“huge 0 397 8
victory” 0 397 8
for 0 397 8
President 0 397 8
Trump. 0 397 8

“A 0 397 9
couple 0 397 9
of 0 397 9
victories 0 397 9
here,” 0 397 9

said. 0 397 9

“The 0 397 10
president 0 397 10
did 0 397 10
not 0 397 10
have 0 397 10
to 0 397 10
sit 0 397 10
down 0 397 10
for 0 397 10
an 0 397 10
interview. 0 397 10

They 1 397 11
were 1 397 11
so 1 397 11
concerned 1 397 11
about 1 397 11
that, 1 397 11
because 1 397 11
he’d 1 397 11
get 1 397 11
caught 1 397 11
up 1 397 11
in 1 397 11
lies–and 1 397 11
there’d 1 397 11
be 1 397 11
perjury 1 397 11
traps. 1 397 11

Okay, 0 397 12
so 0 397 12
that’s 0 397 12
now 0 397 12
over. 0 397 12

No 0 397 13
