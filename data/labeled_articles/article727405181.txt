India 0

U.S. 0

China 0
With 0
Plans 0
to 0
Visit 0
the 0
Moon 0

So 0
far, 0
no 0
one 0
has 0
ever 0
managed 0
to 0
land 0
on 0
the 0
far 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
moon, 0
or 0
near 0
its 0
shadowy 0
poles. 0

India 0
wants 0
to 0
tackle 0
both 0
those 0
firsts 0
in 1
one 1
fell 1
swoop 1
this 0
year, 0
with 0
its 0
Chandrayaan-2 0
mission, 0
a 0
trio 0
of 0
orbiter, 0
lander 0
and 0
rover 0
that 0
would 0
represent 0
the 0
country's 0
second 0
visit 0
to 0
the 0
moon. 0

The 0
mission 0
is 0
scheduled 0
to 0
launch 0
sometime 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
half 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
no 0
earlier 0
than 0
March. 0

Its 0
target 0
is 0
a 0
patch 0
of 0
lunar 0
surface 0
about 0
370 0
miles 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
south 0
pole, 0
where 0
scientists 0
think 0
the 0
rock 0
may 0
be 0
4 0
billion 0
years 0
old, 0
formed 0
just 0
after 0
the 0
moon's 0
giant 0
ocean 0
of 0
liquid 0
rock 0
began 0
to 0
solidify. 0

The 0
region 0
is 0
an 0
area 0
NASA 0
would 0
also 0
like 0
to 0
visit, 0
preferably 0
with 0
a 0
robot 0
that 0
would 0
bring 0
souvenir 0
rock 0
home 0
to 0
Earth 0
for 0
scientists 0
to 0
analyze 0
directly 0
in 0
the 0
laboratory. 0

But 0
despite 0
NASA's 0
renewed 0
focus 0
on 0
lunar 0
exploration, 0
as 0
dictated 0
in 0
December 0
by 0
an 0
order 0
from 0
President 0
Trump, 0
the 0
agency 0
won't 0
beat 0
India 0

That's 0
even 0
after 0
India's 0
Chandrayaan-2 0
mission 0
was 0
delayed 0
by 0
three 0
years 0
after 0
Russia 0
backed 0
out 0
of 0
designing 0
and 0
producing 0
the 0
mission's 0
lander. 0

Rather 0
than 0
lose 0
out 0
on 0
that 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
mission, 0
the 0
Indian 0
Space 0
Research 0
Organization 0
decided 0
to 0
just 0
do 0
it 0
themselves. 0

But 0
they 0
aren't 0
sure 0
how 0
long 0
they 0
can 0
expect 0
the 0
mission 0
to 0
last 0
once 0
the 0
lander 0
and 0
rover 0
arriveâ€”it 0
could 0
be 0
over 0
in 0
as 0
little 0
as 0
two 0
weeks, 0
ending 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
the 0
sun 0
sets, 0
since 0
the 0
mission 0
runs 0
on 0
solar 0
power 0
and 0
the 0
polar 0
area 0
is 0
quite 0
shadowy 0
even 0
during 0
the 0
day. 0

During 0
that 0
time, 0
the 0
team 0
hopes 0
to 0
gather 0
data 0
about 0
charged 0
particles 0
around 0
the 0
moon 0
and 0
the 0
small 0
"moonquakes" 0
that 0
ripple 0
through 0
its 0
surface. 0

The 0
new 0
mission's 0
predecessor, 0
Chandrayaan-1, 0
was 0
an 0
orbiter 0
that 0
found 0
the 0
first 0
evidence 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
water 0
ice 0
on 0
the 0
moon. 0

Now, 0
scientists 0
know 0
that 0
ice 0
is 0
likely 0
concentrated 0
at 0
the 0

where 0
it 0
