Khweis 0 38 3
is 0 38 3
an 0 38 3

reasons. 0 38 3

His 0 38 7
life 0 38 7

to 0 38 10
join 0 38 10

him 0 38 12
to 0 38 12
travel 0 38 12
to 0 38 12

the 0 38 14
worst 0 38 14
decision 0 38 14
I 0 38 14
ever 0 38 14
made,” 0 38 14
Khweis 0 38 14

to 0 38 14
the 0 38 14
judge 0 38 14
in 0 38 14
a 0 38 14
letter. 0 38 14

“I 0 38 15
ruined 1 38 15
my 1 38 15
life 1 38 15
and 1 38 15
my 1 38 15

15 0 38 16
months 0 38 16
of 0 38 16
