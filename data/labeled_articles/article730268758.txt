no 0 163 20

Francis 0 163 21
encountered 0 163 21
protests 0 163 21
in 0 163 21
Chile 0 163 21
over 0 163 21
his 0 163 21

during 0 163 21
his 0 163 21

the 0 163 21
accusations 0 163 21
against 0 163 21
the 0 163 21
priest 0 163 21
“calumny.” 1 163 21

While 0 163 22
Francis 0 163 22
later 0 163 22
apologized, 0 163 22
he 0 163 22
persisted 0 163 22
in 0 163 22
defending 0 163 22
Barros, 0 163 22
denying 0 163 22
that 0 163 22
he 0 163 22
had 0 163 22
received 0 163 22
any 0 163 22
testimony 0 163 22
himself 0 163 22
and 0 163 22
restating 0 163 22
that 0 163 22
such 0 163 22
unproven 0 163 22
accusations 0 163 22
are 0 163 22
“slander.” 1 163 22

The 0 163 23
Pope 0 163 23
later 0 163 23
said 0 163 23
he 0 163 23

Expectations 0 163 24
were 0 163 24
high 0 163 24
in 0 163 24
2014 0 163 24
when 0 163 24
the 0 163 24
Pope 0 163 24

the 0 163 24

And 0 163 25
while 0 163 25

throughout 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
pontificate, 0 163 25
some 0 163 25
have 0 163 25
argued 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
actions 0 163 25
in 0 163 25
some 0 163 25
serious 0 163 25
cases 0 163 25
don’t 0 163 25
match 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
tough 0 163 25

with 0 163 27
O’Malley 0 163 27
that 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
abuse 0 163 27
commission 0 163 27
representatives 0 163 27
reportedly 0 163 27
gave 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
letter 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
cardinal 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
deliver 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
Francis, 0 163 27
and 0 163 27
O’Malley 0 163 27
later 0 163 27
confirmed 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
a 0 163 27
commission 0 163 27
member 0 163 27
that 0 163 27
he 0 163 27
had 0 163 27
in 0 163 27
fact 0 163 27
personally 0 163 27
delivered 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
letter 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
Pope. 0 163 27

Yore 0 163 28
explained 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
Pope 0 163 28
has 0 163 28
been 0 163 28
told 0 163 28
from 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
moment 0 163 28
he 0 163 28
appointed 0 163 28
Barros 0 163 28
in 0 163 28
2015 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
it 0 163 28
was 0 163 28
a 0 163 28
bad 0 163 28
decision, 0 163 28
between 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
Chilean 0 163 28
bishops’ 0 163 28
conference, 0 163 28
petitions, 0 163 28
letters 0 163 28
and 0 163 28
calls, 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
were 0 163 28
all 0 163 28
ignored. 0 163 28

Further, 0 163 29
a 0 163 29
Chilean 0 163 29
judicial 0 163 29
inquiry 0 163 29
found 0 163 29
all 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
victims 0 163 29
who 0 163 29
testified 0 163 29
— 0 163 29
including 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
letter’s 0 163 29
author 0 163 29
Juan 0 163 29
Carlos 0 163 29
— 0 163 29
to 0 163 29
be 0 163 29
credible, 0 163 29
and 0 163 29
that 0 163 29
there 0 163 29
was 0 163 29
a 0 163 29
major 0 163 29
cover-up 0 163 29
of 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
abuse 0 163 29
by 0 163 29
Father 0 163 29
Karadima. 0 163 29

Arroyo 0 163 30
spoke 0 163 30
with 0 163 30
Cruz 0 163 30
as 0 163 30
well, 0 163 30
who 0 163 30
said 0 163 30
he 0 163 30
was 0 163 30
“incredibly 1 163 30
frustrated” 1 163 30
when 0 163 30
Barros 0 163 30
was 0 163 30
going 0 163 30
to 0 163 30
be 0 163 30
appointed. 0 163 30

He’d 0 163 31
testified 0 163 31
about 0 163 31
three 0 163 31
bishops 0 163 31
who 0 163 31
had 0 163 31
witnessed 0 163 31
abuse, 0 163 31
he 0 163 31
said, 0 163 31
but 0 163 31
Barros 0 163 31
had 0 163 31
special 0 163 31
significance 0 163 31
for 0 163 31
him 0 163 31
because 0 163 31
Barros’ 0 163 31
part 0 163 31
went 0 163 31
beyond 0 163 31
witnessing 0 163 31
the 0 163 31
abuse, 0 163 31
to 0 163 31
violating 1 163 31
his 1 163 31
seal 1 163 31
of 1 163 31
Confession 1 163 31
with 1 163 31
Karadima 1 163 31
and 0 163 31
psychological 0 163 31
abuse 0 163 31
through 0 163 31
intimidation. 0 163 31

Cruz 0 163 32
recounted 0 163 32
how 0 163 32
he 0 163 32
and 0 163 32
other 0 163 32
victims 0 163 32
had 0 163 32
been 0 163 32
dismissed 0 163 32
or 0 163 32
slandered 0 163 32
by 0 163 32
local 0 163 32
Church 0 163 32
hierarchy 0 163 32
for 0 163 32
numerous 0 163 32
attempts 0 163 32
to 0 163 32
be 0 163 32
heard. 0 163 32

And 0 163 33
he 0 163 33
spoke 0 163 33
about 0 163 33
holding 0 163 33
out 0 163 33
hope 0 163 33
that 0 163 33
there 0 163 33
would 0 163 33
be 0 163 33
a 0 163 33
different 0 163 33
response 0 163 33
from 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
Pope, 0 163 33
discussing 0 163 33
specifics 0 163 33
of 0 163 33
getting 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
letter 0 163 33
to 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
Francis 0 163 33
via 0 163 33
Cardinal 0 163 33
O’Malley. 0 163 33

Cruz 0 163 34
told 0 163 34
Arroyo 0 163 34
he 0 163 34
was 0 163 34
really 0 163 34
hurt 0 163 34
and 0 163 34
felt 0 163 34
betrayed 0 163 34
by 0 163 34
the 0 163 34
Pope’s 0 163 34
comments 0 163 34
that 0 163 34
the 0 163 34
accusations 0 163 34
were 0 163 34
slander, 0 163 34
and 0 163 34
there 0 163 34
were 0 163 34
no 0 163 34
witnesses 0 163 34
or 0 163 34
evidence. 0 163 34

“To 0 163 35
hear 0 163 35
him 0 163 35
talk 0 163 35
about 0 163 35
us 0 163 35
that 0 163 35
way,” 0 163 35
Cruz 0 163 35
said, 0 163 35
“calling 0 163 35
us 0 163 35
slanderers, 0 163 35
it 0 163 35
was 0 163 35
terrible 0 163 35
because 0 163 35
it 0 163 35
set 0 163 35
the 0 163 35
clock 0 163 35
back 0 163 35
for 0 163 35
so 0 163 35
many 0 163 35
victims.” 0 163 35

Scicluna 0 163 36
will 0 163 36
be 0 163 36
meeting 0 163 36
with 0 163 36
Cruz, 0 163 36
who 0 163 36
said 0 163 36
he 0 163 36
hopes 0 163 36
other 0 163 36
abuse 0 163 36
survivors 0 163 36
will 0 163 36
be 0 163 36
heard 0 163 36
as 0 163 36
a 0 163 36
result 0 163 36
of 0 163 36
his 0 163 36
case 0 163 36
coming 0 163 36
more 0 163 36
to 0 163 36
the 0 163 36
forefront. 0 163 36

“This 0 163 37
leaves 0 163 37
us 0 163 37
with 0 163 37
very 0 163 37
strong 0 163 37
evidence 0 163 37
that 0 163 37
the 0 163 37
Pope 0 163 37
was, 0 163 37
in 0 163 37
fact, 0 163 37
aware 0 163 37
of 0 163 37
what 0 163 37
has 0 163 37
happened,” 0 163 37
Yore 0 163 37
said. 0 163 37

“Here 0 163 38
we 0 163 38
have 0 163 38
victims 0 163 38
10, 0 163 38
15 0 163 38
years 0 163 38
after 0 163 38
their 0 163 38
abuse, 0 163 38
begging 1 163 38
the 1 163 38
Pope, 1 163 38
having 0 163 38
to 0 163 38
take 0 163 38
pictures 0 163 38
of 0 163 38
a 0 163 38
letter 0 163 38
that’s 0 163 38
handed 0 163 38
to 0 163 38
a 0 163 38
cardinal 0 163 38
to 0 163 38
ensure 0 163 38
that 0 163 38
there 0 163 38
is 0 163 38
evidence 0 163 38
that 0 163 38
the 0 163 38
Pope 0 163 38
is 0 163 38
receiving 0 163 38
this 0 163 38
information.” 0 163 38

The 1 163 39
whole 1 163 39
of 1 163 39
Latin 1 163 39
America, 1 163 39
including 1 163 39
Argentina, 1 163 39
was 1 163 39
well 1 163 39
aware 1 163 39
of 1 163 39
what 1 163 39
was 1 163 39
happening 1 163 39
when 0 163 39
this 0 163 39
case 0 163 39
broke 0 163 39
in 0 163 39
Chile 0 163 39
in 0 163 39
2010, 0 163 39
Yore 0 163 39
noted, 0 163 39
and 0 163 39
yet 0 163 39
the 0 163 39
Pope 0 163 39
continues 0 163 39
to 0 163 39
shrug 0 163 39
his 0 163 39
shoulders 0 163 39
and 0 163 39
say 0 163 39
he 0 163 39
has 0 163 39
no 0 163 39
information. 0 163 39

This 0 163 40
was 0 163 40
precisely 0 163 40
what 0 163 40
he’d 0 163 40
been 0 163 40
saying 0 163 40
when 0 163 40
he 0 163 40
was 0 163 40
cardinal 0 163 40
and 0 163 40
archbishop 0 163 40
in 0 163 40
Buenos 0 163 40
Aires, 0 163 40
she 0 163 40
said, 0 163 40
that 0 163 40
no 0 163 40
one 0 163 40
ever 0 163 40
came 0 163 40
forward 0 163 40
with 0 163 40
information, 0 163 40
and 0 163 40
there 1 163 40
were 1 163 40
never 1 163 40
any 1 163 40
cases 1 163 40
of 1 163 40
clerical 1 163 40
abuse 1 163 40
in 1 163 40
the 1 163 40
entirety 1 163 40
of 1 163 40
the 1 163 40
two-million-plus 1 163 40
member 1 163 40

“This 0 163 41
isn’t 0 163 41
just 0 163 41
simply 0 163 41
a 0 163 41
cover-up 0 163 41
of 0 163 41
a 0 163 41
predator 1 163 41
priest,” 1 163 41
Yore 0 163 41
stated. 0 163 41

“This 0 163 42
is 0 163 42
Barros 0 163 42
present, 0 163 42
in 0 163 42
the 0 163 42
room 0 163 42
when 0 163 42
the 0 163 42
abuse 0 163 42
is 0 163 42
ongoing 0 163 42
with 0 163 42
these 0 163 42
young 0 163 42
minor 0 163 42
boys.” 0 163 42

She 0 163 43
said 0 163 43
she 0 163 43
would 0 163 43
argue 0 163 43
as 0 163 43
a 0 163 43
child 0 163 43
advocate 0 163 43
that 0 163 43
Barros 0 163 43
was 0 163 43
involved 0 163 43
in 0 163 43
sexual 0 163 43
exploitation 0 163 43
of 0 163 43
children. 0 163 43

“So 0 163 44
I 0 163 44
don’t 0 163 44
think 0 163 44
this 0 163 44
is 0 163 44
simply 0 163 44
just 0 163 44
a 0 163 44
case, 0 163 44
as 0 163 44
bad 0 163 44
as 0 163 44
it 0 163 44
is, 0 163 44
of 0 163 44
a 0 163 44
cover-up 0 163 44
of 0 163 44
an 0 163 44
abuser,” 0 163 44
she 0 163 44
said. 0 163 44

“This 0 163 45
is 0 163 45
also 0 163 45
sexual 0 163 45
exploitation 0 163 45
of 0 163 45
children 0 163 45
in 0 163 45
a 1 163 45
grooming 1 163 45
gang, 1 163 45
a 1 163 45
predator 1 163 45
priest. 1 163 45

This 0 163 46
is 0 163 46
why 0 163 46
it 0 163 46
is 0 163 46
so 0 163 46
heinous.” 1 163 46

Yore 0 163 47
said 0 163 47
that 0 163 47
given 0 163 47
the 0 163 47
Church’s 0 163 47
sex 0 163 47
abuse 0 163 47
crisis, 0 163 47
one 0 163 47
would 0 163 47
have 0 163 47
thought 0 163 47
going 0 163 47
into 0 163 47
the 0 163 47
2013 0 163 47
conclave 0 163 47
(which 0 163 47
elected 0 163 47
Francis) 0 163 47
that 0 163 47
an 0 163 47
obvious 0 163 47
priority 0 163 47
in 0 163 47
vetting 0 163 47
candidates 0 163 47
for 0 163 47
the 0 163 47
papacy 0 163 47
would 0 163 47
have 0 163 47
meant 0 163 47
a 0 163 47
serious 0 163 47
look 0 163 47
at 0 163 47
their 0 163 47
history 0 163 47
of 0 163 47
handling 0 163 47
abuse 0 163 47
allegations 0 163 47
in 0 163 47
their 0 163 47
previous 0 163 47
sees. 0 163 47

There 0 163 48
are 0 163 48
more 0 163 48
cases 0 163 48
out 0 163 48
there 0 163 48
just 0 163 48
like 0 163 48
Barros 0 163 48
that 0 163 48
have 0 163 48
been 0 163 48
covered 0 163 48
up, 0 163 48
Yore 0 163 48
told 0 163 48
Arroyo, 0 163 48
maybe 0 163 48
even 0 163 48
some 0 163 48
even 0 163 48
worse 0 163 48
than 0 163 48
the 0 163 48
Barros 0 163 48
case. 0 163 48

“Those 0 163 49
cases 0 163 49
are 0 163 49
going 0 163 49
to 1 163 49
be 1 163 49
haunting 1 163 49
this 1 163 49
papacy 1 163 49
and 0 163 49
really 0 163 49
causing 0 163 49
a 0 163 49
rift 0 163 49
in 0 163 49
the 0 163 49
major 0 163 49
protection 0 163 49
of 0 163 49
children 0 163 49
that 0 163 49
Pope 0 163 49
Benedict 0 163 49
had 0 163 49
worked 0 163 49
very 0 163 49
hard 0 163 49
to 0 163 49
really 0 163 49
build 0 163 49
up,” 0 163 49
she 0 163 49
said. 0 163 49

“Trust 0 163 50
within 0 163 50
the 0 163 50
faithful 0 163 50
and 0 163 50
to 0 163 50
put 0 163 50
in 0 163 50
a 0 163 50
system 0 163 50

out 0 163 50
the 0 163 50
predators. 0 163 50

I 0 163 50

think 0 163 50

that 0 163 50

has 0 163 50

just 0 163 50
