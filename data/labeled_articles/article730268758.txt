The 0 48 8
Pope’s 0 48 8
claim 0 48 8
that 0 48 8
he 0 48 8
had 0 48 8
never 0 48 8
received 0 48 8

has 0 48 8
proven 0 48 8
to 0 48 8

false. 0 48 8

“The 0 48 9
Barros 0 48 9
case 0 48 9
is 0 48 9
putting 0 48 9
the 0 48 9
Pope, 0 48 9

Yore 0 48 9
said 0 48 9
during 0 48 9
the 0 48 9
interview. 0 48 9

Yore 0 48 10
said 0 48 10
that 0 48 10
not 0 48 10
only 0 48 10
is 0 48 10
it 0 48 10
now 0 48 10
known 0 48 10
that 0 48 10
the 0 48 10
Pope 0 48 10
received 0 48 10
a 0 48 10
letter 0 48 10
from 0 48 10
one 0 48 10
of 0 48 10
the 0 48 10
victims, 0 48 10
but 0 48 10
it 0 48 10
is 0 48 10
also 0 48 10
now 0 48 10
known 0 48 10
that 0 48 10
he 0 48 10
was 0 48 10
“told 0 48 10
from 0 48 10
the 0 48 10
moment 0 48 10
he 0 48 10
appointed 0 48 10
Bishop 0 48 10
Barros 0 48 10
in 0 48 10
2015 0 48 10
that 0 48 10
this 0 48 10
was 0 48 10
a 0 48 10
bad 0 48 10
decision.” 0 48 10

“The 0 48 11
Chilean 0 48 11
Archbishop 0 48 11
conference 0 48 11

him 0 48 11
to 0 48 11
revoke 0 48 11
this 0 48 11
appointment. 0 48 11

He 0 48 12
received 0 48 12

letters 0 48 12

yet, 0 48 12
ignored 0 48 12
them 0 48 12
all,” 0 48 12
she 0 48 12
said. 0 48 12

As 0 48 13
details 0 48 13
continue 0 48 13
to 0 48 13
surface, 0 48 13
the 0 48 13

professed 0 48 13
empathy 0 48 13
for 0 48 13
abuse 0 48 13

has 0 48 13
come 0 48 13
into 0 48 13
question 0 48 13
as 0 48 13
well. 0 48 13

Yore 0 48 14
called 0 48 14
the 0 48 14
child 0 48 14
sex 0 48 14
abuse 0 48 14

“a 0 48 14
scandal 1 48 14
of 1 48 14
epic 1 48 14
proportions.” 1 48 14

The 0 48 15
scandal 0 48 15
signals 0 48 15
that 0 48 15
the 0 48 15
Church 0 48 15
under 0 48 15
Francis 0 48 15
is 0 48 15
slipping 0 48 15
backwards 0 48 15
in 0 48 15
its 0 48 15
handling 0 48 15
of 0 48 15
abuse, 0 48 15
said 0 48 15
Yore. 0 48 15

Yore 0 48 16
called 0 48 16
the 0 48 16
example 0 48 16
Pope 0 48 16
Francis 0 48 16
set 0 48 16
in 0 48 16

“But 0 48 17
it 0 48 17
is 0 48 17
extremely 1 48 17

you 0 48 17
know, 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
last 0 48 17
appeal 0 48 17
— 0 48 17
that 0 48 17
this 0 48 17
is 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
kind 0 48 17
of 0 48 17
behavior 0 48 17
that 0 48 17
is 0 48 17
going 0 48 17

mimicked 0 48 17
around 0 48 17

by 0 48 17
bishops, 0 48 17
[who 0 48 17
will 0 48 17
say] 0 48 17
‘Well 1 48 17
if 1 48 17
the 1 48 17
Pope 1 48 17
is 1 48 17
not 1 48 17

impose 1 48 17
zero 1 48 17
tolerance, 1 48 17
why 1 48 17
should 1 48 17
I?’” 0 48 17

Reports 0 48 18
say 0 48 18
Pope 0 48 18
Francis 0 48 18
personally 0 48 18
received 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
eight-page 0 48 18
letter 0 48 18
from 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
Chilean 0 48 18

detailing 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
alleged 0 48 18
abuses 0 48 18
by 0 48 18
Karadima 0 48 18
and 0 48 18
linking 0 48 18

and 0 48 18
covered 0 48 18
up 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
abuse. 0 48 18

The 0 48 19
alleged 0 48 19
abuse 0 48 19
took 0 48 19
place 0 48 19
decades 0 48 19
prior 0 48 19
to 0 48 19
Francis’s 0 48 19
2015 0 48 19

Pope 0 48 20
Francis 0 48 20
received 0 48 20
the 0 48 20
victim’s 0 48 20
letter 0 48 20
in 0 48 20
2015, 0 48 20
its 0 48 20
author 0 48 20
and 0 48 20
a 0 48 20
member 0 48 20
of 0 48 20
Francis’s 0 48 20
sex 0 48 20
abuse 0 48 20
commission 0 48 20
have 0 48 20
said, 0 48 20
contradicting 0 48 20
the 0 48 20
Pope’s 0 48 20
recent 0 48 20
insistence 0 48 20
that 0 48 20
no 0 48 20
victims 0 48 20
had 0 48 20
come 0 48 20
forward 0 48 20
in 0 48 20
the 0 48 20
matter 0 48 20
and 0 48 20
no 0 48 20
evidence 0 48 20
had 0 48 20
been 0 48 20
produced. 0 48 20

Francis 0 48 21
encountered 0 48 21
protests 0 48 21
in 0 48 21
Chile 0 48 21
over 0 48 21
his 0 48 21
defense 0 48 21
of 0 48 21
Barros 0 48 21
during 0 48 21
his 0 48 21
visit 0 48 21
there 0 48 21
last 0 48 21
month, 0 48 21
calling 0 48 21
the 0 48 21
accusations 0 48 21
against 0 48 21
the 0 48 21
priest 0 48 21
“calumny.” 1 48 21

While 0 48 22
Francis 0 48 22
later 0 48 22
apologized, 0 48 22
he 0 48 22
persisted 0 48 22
in 0 48 22
defending 0 48 22
Barros, 0 48 22
denying 0 48 22
that 0 48 22
he 0 48 22
had 0 48 22
received 0 48 22
any 0 48 22
testimony 0 48 22
himself 0 48 22
and 0 48 22
restating 0 48 22
that 0 48 22
such 0 48 22
unproven 0 48 22
accusations 0 48 22
are 0 48 22
“slander.” 1 48 22

The 0 48 23
Pope 0 48 23
later 0 48 23
said 0 48 23
he 0 48 23
would 0 48 23
send 0 48 23
Malta 0 48 23
Archbishop 0 48 23
Charles 0 48 23
Scicluna 0 48 23
– 0 48 23
the 0 48 23
former 0 48 23
top 0 48 23
Vatican 0 48 23
abuse 0 48 23
investigator 0 48 23
- 0 48 23
to 0 48 23
Chile 0 48 23
to 0 48 23
investigate 0 48 23
the 0 48 23
matter. 0 48 23

Expectations 0 48 24
were 0 48 24
high 0 48 24
in 0 48 24
2014 0 48 24
when 0 48 24
the 0 48 24
Pope 0 48 24
created 0 48 24
the 0 48 24
abuse 0 48 24
commission. 0 48 24

And 0 48 25
while 0 48 25
he 0 48 25
has 0 48 25
continually 0 48 25
condemned 0 48 25
clergy 0 48 25
sex 0 48 25
abuse 0 48 25
throughout 0 48 25
his 0 48 25
pontificate, 0 48 25
some 0 48 25
have 0 48 25
argued 0 48 25
his 0 48 25
actions 0 48 25
in 0 48 25
some 0 48 25
serious 0 48 25
cases 0 48 25
don’t 0 48 25
match 0 48 25
his 0 48 25
tough 0 48 25
stances 0 48 25
on 0 48 25
abuse. 0 48 25

Four 0 48 26
members 0 48 26
of 0 48 26
the 0 48 26
commission 0 48 26
had 0 48 26
met 0 48 26
with 0 48 26
Cardinal 0 48 26
O’Malley 0 48 26
in 0 48 26
2015, 0 48 26
conveying 0 48 26
their 0 48 26
objections 0 48 26
to 0 48 26
Francis’s 0 48 26
2015 0 48 26
appointment 0 48 26
of 0 48 26
Barros 0 48 26
as 0 48 26
bishop 0 48 26
of 0 48 26
Osorno. 0 48 26

It 0 48 27
was 0 48 27
at 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
meeting 0 48 27
with 0 48 27
O’Malley 0 48 27
that 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
abuse 0 48 27
commission 0 48 27
representatives 0 48 27
reportedly 0 48 27
gave 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
letter 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
cardinal 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
deliver 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
Francis, 0 48 27
and 0 48 27
O’Malley 0 48 27
later 0 48 27
confirmed 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
a 0 48 27
commission 0 48 27
member 0 48 27
that 0 48 27
he 0 48 27
had 0 48 27
in 0 48 27
fact 0 48 27
personally 0 48 27
delivered 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
letter 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
Pope. 0 48 27

Yore 0 48 28
explained 0 48 28
that 0 48 28
the 0 48 28
Pope 0 48 28
has 0 48 28
been 0 48 28
told 0 48 28
from 0 48 28
the 0 48 28
moment 0 48 28
he 0 48 28
appointed 0 48 28
Barros 0 48 28
in 0 48 28
2015 0 48 28
that 0 48 28
it 0 48 28
was 0 48 28
a 0 48 28
bad 0 48 28
decision, 0 48 28
between 0 48 28
the 0 48 28
Chilean 0 48 28
bishops’ 0 48 28
conference, 0 48 28
petitions, 0 48 28
letters 0 48 28
and 0 48 28
calls, 0 48 28
that 0 48 28
were 0 48 28
all 0 48 28
ignored. 0 48 28

Further, 0 48 29
a 0 48 29
Chilean 0 48 29
judicial 0 48 29
inquiry 0 48 29
found 0 48 29
all 0 48 29
the 0 48 29
victims 0 48 29
who 0 48 29
testified 0 48 29
— 0 48 29
including 0 48 29
the 0 48 29
letter’s 0 48 29
author 0 48 29
Juan 0 48 29
Carlos 0 48 29
— 0 48 29
to 0 48 29
be 0 48 29
credible, 0 48 29
and 0 48 29
that 0 48 29
there 0 48 29
was 0 48 29
a 0 48 29
major 0 48 29
cover-up 0 48 29
of 0 48 29
the 0 48 29
abuse 0 48 29
by 0 48 29
Father 0 48 29
Karadima. 0 48 29

Arroyo 0 48 30
spoke 0 48 30
with 0 48 30
Cruz 0 48 30
as 0 48 30
well, 0 48 30
who 0 48 30
said 0 48 30
he 0 48 30
was 0 48 30
“incredibly 1 48 30
frustrated” 1 48 30
when 0 48 30
Barros 0 48 30
was 0 48 30
going 0 48 30
to 0 48 30
be 0 48 30
appointed. 0 48 30

He’d 0 48 31
testified 0 48 31
about 0 48 31
three 0 48 31
bishops 0 48 31
who 0 48 31
had 0 48 31
witnessed 0 48 31
abuse, 0 48 31
he 0 48 31
said, 0 48 31
but 0 48 31
Barros 0 48 31
had 0 48 31
special 0 48 31
significance 0 48 31
for 0 48 31
him 0 48 31
because 0 48 31
Barros’ 0 48 31
part 0 48 31
went 0 48 31
beyond 0 48 31
witnessing 0 48 31
the 0 48 31
abuse, 0 48 31
to 0 48 31
violating 1 48 31
his 1 48 31
seal 1 48 31
of 1 48 31
Confession 1 48 31
with 1 48 31
Karadima 1 48 31
and 0 48 31
psychological 0 48 31
abuse 0 48 31
through 0 48 31
intimidation. 0 48 31

Cruz 0 48 32
recounted 0 48 32
how 0 48 32
he 0 48 32
and 0 48 32
other 0 48 32
victims 0 48 32
had 0 48 32
been 0 48 32
dismissed 0 48 32
or 0 48 32
slandered 0 48 32
by 0 48 32
local 0 48 32
Church 0 48 32
hierarchy 0 48 32
for 0 48 32
numerous 0 48 32
attempts 0 48 32
to 0 48 32
be 0 48 32
heard. 0 48 32

And 0 48 33
he 0 48 33
spoke 0 48 33
about 0 48 33
holding 0 48 33
out 0 48 33
hope 0 48 33
that 0 48 33
there 0 48 33
would 0 48 33
be 0 48 33
a 0 48 33
different 0 48 33
response 0 48 33
from 0 48 33
the 0 48 33
Pope, 0 48 33
discussing 0 48 33
specifics 0 48 33
of 0 48 33
getting 0 48 33
the 0 48 33
letter 0 48 33
to 0 48 33
the 0 48 33
Francis 0 48 33
via 0 48 33
Cardinal 0 48 33
O’Malley. 0 48 33

Cruz 0 48 34
told 0 48 34
Arroyo 0 48 34
he 0 48 34
was 0 48 34
really 0 48 34
hurt 0 48 34
and 0 48 34
felt 0 48 34
betrayed 0 48 34
by 0 48 34
the 0 48 34
Pope’s 0 48 34
comments 0 48 34
that 0 48 34
the 0 48 34
accusations 0 48 34
were 0 48 34
slander, 0 48 34
and 0 48 34
there 0 48 34
were 0 48 34
no 0 48 34
witnesses 0 48 34
or 0 48 34
evidence. 0 48 34

“To 0 48 35
hear 0 48 35
him 0 48 35
talk 0 48 35
about 0 48 35
us 0 48 35
that 0 48 35
way,” 0 48 35
Cruz 0 48 35
said, 0 48 35
“calling 0 48 35
us 0 48 35
slanderers, 0 48 35
it 0 48 35
was 0 48 35
terrible 0 48 35
because 0 48 35
it 0 48 35
set 0 48 35
the 0 48 35
clock 0 48 35
back 0 48 35
for 0 48 35
so 0 48 35
many 0 48 35
victims.” 0 48 35

Scicluna 0 48 36
will 0 48 36
be 0 48 36
meeting 0 48 36
with 0 48 36
Cruz, 0 48 36
who 0 48 36
said 0 48 36
he 0 48 36
hopes 0 48 36
other 0 48 36
abuse 0 48 36
survivors 0 48 36
will 0 48 36
be 0 48 36
heard 0 48 36
as 0 48 36
a 0 48 36
result 0 48 36
of 0 48 36
his 0 48 36
case 0 48 36
coming 0 48 36
more 0 48 36
to 0 48 36
the 0 48 36
forefront. 0 48 36

“This 0 48 37
leaves 0 48 37
us 0 48 37
with 0 48 37
very 0 48 37
strong 0 48 37
evidence 0 48 37
that 0 48 37
the 0 48 37
Pope 0 48 37
was, 0 48 37
in 0 48 37
fact, 0 48 37
aware 0 48 37
of 0 48 37
what 0 48 37
has 0 48 37
happened,” 0 48 37
Yore 0 48 37
said. 0 48 37

“Here 0 48 38
we 0 48 38
have 0 48 38
victims 0 48 38
10, 0 48 38
15 0 48 38
years 0 48 38
after 0 48 38
their 0 48 38
abuse, 0 48 38
begging 1 48 38
the 1 48 38
Pope, 1 48 38
having 0 48 38
to 0 48 38
take 0 48 38
pictures 0 48 38
of 0 48 38
a 0 48 38
letter 0 48 38
that’s 0 48 38
handed 0 48 38
to 0 48 38
a 0 48 38
cardinal 0 48 38
to 0 48 38
ensure 0 48 38
that 0 48 38
there 0 48 38
is 0 48 38
evidence 0 48 38
that 0 48 38
the 0 48 38
Pope 0 48 38
is 0 48 38
receiving 0 48 38
this 0 48 38
information.” 0 48 38

The 1 48 39
whole 1 48 39
of 1 48 39
Latin 1 48 39
America, 1 48 39
including 1 48 39
Argentina, 1 48 39
was 1 48 39
well 1 48 39
aware 1 48 39
of 1 48 39
what 1 48 39
was 1 48 39
happening 1 48 39
when 0 48 39
this 0 48 39
case 0 48 39
broke 0 48 39
in 0 48 39
Chile 0 48 39
in 0 48 39
2010, 0 48 39
Yore 0 48 39
noted, 0 48 39
and 0 48 39
yet 0 48 39
the 0 48 39
Pope 0 48 39
continues 0 48 39
to 0 48 39
shrug 0 48 39
his 0 48 39
shoulders 0 48 39
and 0 48 39
say 0 48 39
he 0 48 39
has 0 48 39
no 0 48 39
information. 0 48 39

This 0 48 40
was 0 48 40
precisely 0 48 40
what 0 48 40
he’d 0 48 40
been 0 48 40
saying 0 48 40
when 0 48 40
he 0 48 40
was 0 48 40
cardinal 0 48 40
and 0 48 40
archbishop 0 48 40
in 0 48 40
Buenos 0 48 40
Aires, 0 48 40
she 0 48 40
said, 0 48 40
that 0 48 40
no 0 48 40
one 0 48 40
ever 0 48 40
came 0 48 40
forward 0 48 40
with 0 48 40
information, 0 48 40
and 0 48 40
there 1 48 40
were 1 48 40
never 1 48 40
any 1 48 40
cases 1 48 40
of 1 48 40
clerical 1 48 40
abuse 1 48 40
in 1 48 40
the 1 48 40
entirety 1 48 40
of 1 48 40
the 1 48 40
two-million-plus 1 48 40
member 1 48 40
Archdiocese 1 48 40
of 1 48 40
Buenos 1 48 40
Aires. 1 48 40

“This 0 48 41
isn’t 0 48 41
just 0 48 41
simply 0 48 41
a 0 48 41
cover-up 0 48 41
of 0 48 41
a 0 48 41
predator 1 48 41
priest,” 1 48 41
Yore 0 48 41
stated. 0 48 41

“This 0 48 42
is 0 48 42
Barros 0 48 42
present, 0 48 42
in 0 48 42
the 0 48 42
room 0 48 42
when 0 48 42
the 0 48 42
abuse 0 48 42
is 0 48 42
ongoing 0 48 42
with 0 48 42
these 0 48 42
young 0 48 42
minor 0 48 42
boys.” 0 48 42

She 0 48 43
said 0 48 43
she 0 48 43
would 0 48 43
argue 0 48 43
as 0 48 43
a 0 48 43
child 0 48 43
advocate 0 48 43
that 0 48 43
Barros 0 48 43
was 0 48 43
involved 0 48 43
in 0 48 43
sexual 0 48 43
exploitation 0 48 43
of 0 48 43
children. 0 48 43

“So 0 48 44
I 0 48 44
don’t 0 48 44
think 0 48 44
this 0 48 44
is 0 48 44
simply 0 48 44
just 0 48 44
a 0 48 44
case, 0 48 44
as 0 48 44
bad 0 48 44
as 0 48 44
it 0 48 44
is, 0 48 44
of 0 48 44
a 0 48 44
cover-up 0 48 44
of 0 48 44
an 0 48 44
abuser,” 0 48 44
she 0 48 44
said. 0 48 44

“This 0 48 45
is 0 48 45
also 0 48 45
sexual 0 48 45
exploitation 0 48 45
of 0 48 45
children 0 48 45
in 0 48 45
a 1 48 45
grooming 1 48 45
gang, 1 48 45
a 1 48 45
predator 1 48 45
priest. 1 48 45

This 0 48 46
is 0 48 46
why 0 48 46
it 0 48 46
is 0 48 46
so 0 48 46
heinous.” 1 48 46

Yore 0 48 47
said 0 48 47
that 0 48 47
given 0 48 47
the 0 48 47
Church’s 0 48 47
sex 0 48 47
abuse 0 48 47
crisis, 0 48 47
one 0 48 47
would 0 48 47
have 0 48 47
thought 0 48 47
going 0 48 47
into 0 48 47
the 0 48 47
2013 0 48 47
conclave 0 48 47
(which 0 48 47
elected 0 48 47
Francis) 0 48 47
that 0 48 47
an 0 48 47
obvious 0 48 47
priority 0 48 47
in 0 48 47
vetting 0 48 47
candidates 0 48 47
for 0 48 47
the 0 48 47
papacy 0 48 47
would 0 48 47
have 0 48 47
meant 0 48 47
a 0 48 47
serious 0 48 47
look 0 48 47
at 0 48 47
their 0 48 47
history 0 48 47
of 0 48 47
handling 0 48 47
abuse 0 48 47
allegations 0 48 47
in 0 48 47
their 0 48 47
previous 0 48 47
sees. 0 48 47

There 0 48 48
are 0 48 48
more 0 48 48
cases 0 48 48
out 0 48 48
there 0 48 48
just 0 48 48
like 0 48 48
Barros 0 48 48
that 0 48 48
have 0 48 48
been 0 48 48
covered 0 48 48
up, 0 48 48
Yore 0 48 48
told 0 48 48
Arroyo, 0 48 48
maybe 0 48 48
even 0 48 48
some 0 48 48
even 0 48 48
worse 0 48 48
than 0 48 48
the 0 48 48
Barros 0 48 48
case. 0 48 48

“Those 0 48 49
cases 0 48 49
are 0 48 49
going 0 48 49
to 1 48 49
be 1 48 49
haunting 1 48 49
this 1 48 49
papacy 1 48 49
and 0 48 49
really 0 48 49
causing 0 48 49
a 0 48 49
rift 0 48 49
in 0 48 49
the 0 48 49
major 0 48 49
protection 0 48 49
of 0 48 49
children 0 48 49
that 0 48 49
Pope 0 48 49
Benedict 0 48 49
had 0 48 49
worked 0 48 49
very 0 48 49
hard 0 48 49
to 0 48 49
really 0 48 49
build 0 48 49
up,” 0 48 49
she 0 48 49
said. 0 48 49

“Trust 0 48 50
within 0 48 50
the 0 48 50
faithful 0 48 50
and 0 48 50
to 0 48 50
put 0 48 50
in 0 48 50
a 0 48 50
system 0 48 50
that 0 48 50
was 0 48 50
going 0 48 50
to 0 48 50
root 0 48 50
out 0 48 50
the 0 48 50
predators. 0 48 50

And 0 48 51
I 0 48 51
think 0 48 51
that 0 48 51
has 0 48 51
just 0 48 51
been 0 48 51
blown 0 48 51
up 0 48 51
and 0 48 51
I 0 48 51
think 0 48 51
we 0 48 51
are 0 48 51
back 0 48 51
to 0 48 51
square 0 48 51
one 0 48 51
in 0 48 51
