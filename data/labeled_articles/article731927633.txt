on 0 147 7

of 1 147 8

"Christianity 1 147 9
is 1 147 9
Europe's 1 147 9
last 1 147 9
hope," 1 147 9
Orban 0 147 9
told 0 147 9
an 0 147 9

"our 1 147 10
worst 1 147 10
nightmares 1 147 10

come 1 147 10

The 1 147 11

as 1 147 11
it 1 147 11
fails 1 147 11
to 1 147 11
see 1 147 11
Europe 1 147 11
being 1 147 11
overrun." 1 147 11

Orban 0 147 12
is 0 147 12
widely 0 147 12
credited 0 147 12
for 0 147 12
reversing 0 147 12
an 0 147 12
economic 0 147 12
slump 0 147 12
in 0 147 12
Hungary 0 147 12
and 0 147 12
controlling 0 147 12
its 0 147 12
public 0 147 12

culminating 0 147 12
in 0 147 12
a 0 147 12
return 0 147 12
to 0 147 12
investment-grade 0 147 12
for 0 147 12
its 0 147 12
debt, 0 147 12
which 0 147 12
was 0 147 12
cut 0 147 12
to 0 147 12
'junk' 0 147 12
during 0 147 12

To 0 147 13
achieve 0 147 13
that 0 147 13
and 0 147 13
hold 0 147 13
onto 0 147 13
power 0 147 13
the 0 147 13
prime 0 147 13
minister, 0 147 13
54, 0 147 13
has 0 147 13
used 0 147 13
methods 0 147 13
that 0 147 13
critics 0 147 13
have 0 147 13
called 0 147 13
authoritarian, 0 147 13
and 0 147 13
picked 0 147 13
fights 0 147 13
with 0 147 13
EU 0 147 13
partners, 0 147 13
especially 0 147 13
in 0 147 13
the 0 147 13
West. 0 147 13

Eastern 0 147 14
leaders, 0 147 14
most 0 147 14
notably 0 147 14
in 0 147 14
Poland, 0 147 14
have 0 147 14
followed 0 147 14
his 0 147 14
lead. 0 147 14

But 0 147 15
migration 0 147 15
dominates 0 147 15
his 0 147 15
agenda 0 147 15
now. 0 147 15

Orban 0 147 16
said 0 147 16
on 0 147 16
Sunday 0 147 16
that 0 147 16
Europe 0 147 16
faces 0 147 16
a 0 147 16
critical 0 147 16
fissure 0 147 16
between 0 147 16
nation 0 147 16
states 0 147 16
of 0 147 16
the 0 147 16
East 0 147 16
and 0 147 16
the 0 147 16
West, 0 147 16
which 0 147 16
he 0 147 16
called 0 147 16
an 0 147 16
"immigrant 0 147 16
zone, 0 147 16
a 0 147 16
mixed 0 147 16
population 0 147 16

that 0 147 16
heads 0 147 16

a 1 147 16

different 1 147 16
from 1 147 16

As 0 147 17
the 0 147 17
West 0 147 17
wants 0 147 17
eastern 0 147 17
Europe 0 147 17
to 0 147 17
follow 0 147 17
its 0 147 17
lead, 0 147 17
an 0 147 17
increasingly 1 147 17
vicious 1 147 17
struggle 1 147 17
was 0 147 17
likely, 0 147 17
he 0 147 17
said, 0 147 17
alluding 0 147 17
to 0 147 17
a 0 147 17
plan 0 147 17

leaders 0 147 17
of 0 147 17

"Absurd 0 147 18

it 0 147 18
may 0 147 18
sound 0 147 18
the 1 147 18

we 1 147 18
face 1 147 18
comes 1 147 18
from 1 147 18

has 0 147 22
advocated 0 147 22

defining 0 147 23
moment 0 147 23
of 0 147 23

also 0 147 24

the 0 147 24

POWERFUL 0 147 26
ALLIES 0 147 26

Orban 0 147 27

Orban 0 147 30

he 0 147 30
anticipated 0 147 30
that 0 147 30
