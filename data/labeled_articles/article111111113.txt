Zarate, 0 139 2
a 0 139 2
45-year-old 0 139 2
Mexican 0 139 2

on 0 139 2

and 0 139 2
manslaughter 0 139 2
charges. 0 139 2

The 0 139 3

convicted 0 139 3
him 0 139 3
of 0 139 3
the 0 139 3
lesser 0 139 3
charge 0 139 3

Steinle, 0 139 4
32, 0 139 4
was 0 139 4
fatally 0 139 4
shot 0 139 4
while 0 139 4
she 0 139 4
walked 0 139 4
along 0 139 4
Pier 0 139 4

The 0 139 5

pierced 0 139 5
her 0 139 5
back 0 139 5

ricocheted 0 139 5
off 0 139 5
the 0 139 5
concrete 0 139 5
ground 0 139 5
after 0 139 5
it 0 139 5
was 0 139 5
fired 0 139 5
by 0 139 5
Garcia 0 139 5
Zarate 0 139 5
from 0 139 5
a 0 139 5
handgun 0 139 5
belonging 0 139 5
to 0 139 5
a 0 139 5
federal 0 139 5

been 0 139 5
stolen 0 139 5
four 0 139 5
days 0 139 5
earlier. 0 139 5

Garcia 0 139 6
Zarate's 0 139 6
defense 0 139 6
attorneys 0 139 6
argued 0 139 6
that 0 139 6
the 0 139 6
shooting 0 139 6
was 0 139 6
an 0 139 6
accident 0 139 6
— 0 139 6
they 0 139 6
said 0 139 6
he 0 139 6
found 0 139 6
the 0 139 6
gun 0 139 6
wrapped 0 139 6
in 0 139 6
a 0 139 6
T-shirt 0 139 6

cloth 0 139 6
under 0 139 6
a 0 139 6
pier 0 139 6
bench 0 139 6
and 0 139 6
unintentionally 0 139 6
discharged 0 139 6
it. 0 139 6

Lead 0 139 7
attorney 0 139 7
Matt 0 139 7
Gonzalez 0 139 7
has 0 139 7
argued 0 139 7
that 0 139 7
the 0 139 7
weapon 0 139 7
was 0 139 7
a 0 139 7
SIG 0 139 7
Sauer 0 139 7
with 0 139 7
a 0 139 7
"hair 1 139 7

in 1 139 7
single-action 1 139 7
mode" 1 139 7
— 0 139 7
a 0 139 7
model 0 139 7
well-known 0 139 7
for 0 139 7
accidental 0 139 7
discharges 0 139 7
even 0 139 7
among 0 139 7
experienced 0 139 7
shooters. 0 139 7

Gonzalez 0 139 8
told 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
jury, 0 139 8
according 0 139 8
to 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
San 0 139 8
Francisco 0 139 8
Chronicle, 0 139 8
that 0 139 8
Garcia 0 139 8
Zarate 0 139 8
had 0 139 8
never 0 139 8
handled 0 139 8
a 0 139 8
firearm 0 139 8
before, 0 139 8
was 0 139 8
frightened 0 139 8
by 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
noise 0 139 8
of 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
gunshot, 0 139 8
then 0 139 8
flung 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
weapon 0 139 8
into 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
bay 0 139 8
where 0 139 8
it 0 139 8
was 0 139 8
later 0 139 8
found 0 139 8
by 0 139 8
a 0 139 8
diver. 0 139 8

Prosecutors, 0 139 9
however, 0 139 9
alleged 0 139 9
that 0 139 9
Garcia 0 139 9
Zarate 0 139 9
brought 0 139 9
the 0 139 9
weapon 0 139 9
to 0 139 9
the 0 139 9
pier 0 139 9
deliberately 0 139 9
to 0 139 9
do 0 139 9
harm, 0 139 9
and 0 139 9
intentionally 0 139 9
aimed 0 139 9
and 0 139 9
shot 0 139 9
Steinle 0 139 9
after 0 139 9
firmly 0 139 9
pulling 0 139 9
the 0 139 9
trigger. 0 139 9

They 0 139 10
said 0 139 10
Garcia 0 139 10
Zarate 0 139 10
then 0 139 10
threw 0 139 10
the 0 139 10
weapon 0 139 10
into 0 139 10
the 0 139 10
bay 0 139 10
and 0 139 10
fled 0 139 10
the 0 139 10
scene. 0 139 10

Beyond 0 139 11
the 0 139 11
shooting 0 139 11
itself, 0 139 11
perhaps 0 139 11
the 0 139 11
most 0 139 11
controversial 0 139 11
aspect 0 139 11
of 0 139 11
Garcia 0 139 11
Zarate's 0 139 11
case 0 139 11
involves 0 139 11
his 0 139 11
previous 0 139 11
criminal 0 139 11
activity 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
history 0 139 11
of 0 139 11
deportations, 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
how 0 139 11
San 0 139 11
Francisco 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
federal 0 139 11
authorities 0 139 11
handled 0 139 11
his 0 139 11
custody 0 139 11
before 0 139 11
he 0 139 11
ever 0 139 11
picked 0 139 11
up 0 139 11
the 0 139 11
gun 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
shot 0 139 11
Steinle. 0 139 11

At 0 139 12
the 0 139 12
time 0 139 12
of 0 139 12
Steinle's 0 139 12
death, 0 139 12
Garcia 0 139 12
Zarate 0 139 12
had 0 139 12
been 0 139 12
convicted 0 139 12
of 0 139 12
nonviolent 0 139 12
drug 0 139 12
crimes 0 139 12
and 0 139 12
deported 0 139 12
five 0 139 12
times 0 139 12
since 0 139 12
the 0 139 12
early 0 139 12
1990s. 0 139 12

He 0 139 13
faced 0 139 13
a 0 139 13
sixth 0 139 13
deportation 0 139 13
in 0 139 13
2015, 0 139 13

in 0 139 13

Department 0 139 13
(DOJ) 0 139 13

serving 0 139 13
46 0 139 13
months 0 139 13
in 0 139 13

re-entry 0 139 13
into 0 139 13
the 0 139 13
US, 0 139 13
but 0 139 13
instead 0 139 13
of 0 139 13
transferring 0 139 13
him 0 139 13
into 0 139 13

Immigration 0 139 13

Customs 0 139 13
Enforcement 0 139 13
(ICE) 0 139 13
for 0 139 13
deportation, 0 139 13
the 0 139 13
department 0 139 13
transferred 0 139 13
him 0 139 13
to 0 139 13
the 0 139 13
San 0 139 13
Francisco 0 139 13
County 0 139 13

of 0 139 13
a 0 139 13
1995 0 139 13

charge. 0 139 13

San 0 139 14

prosecutors, 0 139 14
who 0 139 14
had 0 139 14
long 0 139 14
ago 0 139 14
deprioritized 0 139 14
marijuana 0 139 14
charges, 0 139 14
dismissed 0 139 14
the 0 139 14
decades-old 0 139 14

and 0 139 14
released 0 139 14
Garcia 0 139 14

on 0 139 14
April 0 139 14
15, 0 139 14
2015. 0 139 14

Due 0 139 15
to 0 139 15
San 0 139 15
Francisco's 0 139 15
policy 0 139 15
of 0 139 15
limiting 0 139 15
cooperation 0 139 15
with 0 139 15
federal 0 139 15
immigration 0 139 15
authorities 0 139 15
— 0 139 15
which 0 139 15
some 0 139 15
refer 0 139 15
to 0 139 15
as 0 139 15
a 0 139 15
"sanctuary" 1 139 15
policy 1 139 15
— 0 139 15
the 0 139 15
city 0 139 15
did 0 139 15
not 0 139 15
inform 0 139 15
ICE 0 139 15
when 0 139 15
they 0 139 15
released 0 139 15

As 0 139 16
a 0 139 16
result 0 139 16
of 0 139 16
the 0 139 16
case, 0 139 16
both 0 139 16
the 0 139 16
DOJ 0 139 16
and 0 139 16
the 0 139 16
city 0 139 16
of 0 139 16
San 0 139 16
Francisco 0 139 16
have 0 139 16
changed 0 139 16
several 0 139 16
policies. 0 139 16

The 0 139 17
DOJ 0 139 17
announced 0 139 17
in 0 139 17
2016 0 139 17
it 0 139 17
would 0 139 17
no 0 139 17
longer 0 139 17
release 0 139 17
potentially 0 139 17
deportable 0 139 17
detainees 0 139 17
to 0 139 17
local 0 139 17
jails 0 139 17
without 0 139 17
first 0 139 17
allowing 0 139 17
ICE 0 139 17
to 0 139 17
take 0 139 17
custody. 0 139 17

San 0 139 18
Francisco, 0 139 18
meanwhile, 0 139 18
has 0 139 18
adjusted 0 139 18
its 0 139 18
policy 0 139 18
to 0 139 18
notify 0 139 18
ICE 0 139 18
if 0 139 18
they 0 139 18
are 0 139 18
releasing 0 139 18
suspected 0 139 18
undocumented 0 139 18
immigrants 0 139 18
who 0 139 18
face 0 139 18

violent 0 139 18
felonies. 0 139 18

"This 1 139 19
tragedy 1 139 19
could 1 139 19
have 1 139 19
been 1 139 19
prevented 1 139 19
if 1 139 19
San 1 139 19
Francisco 1 139 19
had 1 139 19
simply 1 139 19
turned 1 139 19

over 1 139 19
to 1 139 19

as 1 139 19
we 1 139 19
requested, 1 139 19
instead 1 139 19
of 1 139 19
releasing 1 139 19
him 1 139 19
back 1 139 19
onto 1 139 19
the 1 139 19
streets," 1 139 19
ICE 0 139 19
Director 0 139 19
Thomas 0 139 19
Homan 0 139 19
said 0 139 19
in 0 139 19
a 0 139 19
statement 0 139 19
on 0 139 19
Thursday. 0 139 19

"It 0 139 20
is 0 139 20
unconscionable 0 139 20
that 0 139 20
politicians 1 139 20
across 1 139 20
this 1 139 20
country 1 139 20
continue 1 139 20
to 1 139 20
endanger 1 139 20
the 1 139 20
lives 1 139 20
of 1 139 20
Americans 1 139 20
with 1 139 20

harm 1 139 20
inflicted 1 139 20
on 1 139 20
their 1 139 20
constituents." 1 139 20

But 0 139 21
ICE 0 139 21
has 0 139 21
faced 0 139 21
criticism 0 139 21
of 0 139 21
its 0 139 21
own 0 139 21
over 0 139 21
not 0 139 21
seeking 0 139 21
a 0 139 21

to 0 139 21
legally 0 139 21
obtain 0 139 21
custody 0 139 21
of 0 139 21
Garcia 0 139 21
Zarate 0 139 21
when 0 139 21
it 0 139 21
discovered 0 139 21
he 0 139 21

transferred 0 139 21
into 0 139 21

Francisco's 0 139 21
custody. 0 139 21

The 0 139 22
agency 0 139 22
has 0 139 22
argued 0 139 22
that 0 139 22
obtaining 0 139 22
judicial 0 139 22
warrants 0 139 22
are 0 139 22
unnecessary 0 139 22
