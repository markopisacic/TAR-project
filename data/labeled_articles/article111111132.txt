Gym 0
is 0
Trenton 0
Tolliver’s 0
favorite 0
class. 0

But 0
the 0
7-year-old 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
huge 1
fan 0
of 0
the 0
weekly 0
Bible 0
course 0
at 0
Princeton 0
Primary, 0
his 0
public 0
elementary 0
school. 0

He 0
gets 0
to 0
play 0
matching 0
games 0
about 0
Bible 0
stories 0
and 0
listen 0
to 0
classic 0
tales. 0

Noah 0
and 0
the 0
Ark 0
is 0
a 0
favorite. 0

Adam 0
and 0
Eve 0
and 0
the 0
garden 0
of 0
Eden, 0
of 0
course. 0

And 0
the 0
story 0
about 0
how 0
their 0
son 0
Cain 0
killed 0
his 0
brother, 0
Abel. 0

“That 0

one 0
was 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
of 0
a 0
surprise,” 0
Trenton 0
said 0
as 0
he 0
sat 0
with 0
his 0
parents, 0
Brett 0
and 0
Courtney 0
Tolliver, 0
one 0
day 0
this 0
month 0
watching 0
his 0
little 0
sister’s 0
soccer 0
practice 0
on 0
a 0
lush 0
field 0
in 0
this 0
small 0
town 0
in 0
the 0
mountains 0
of 0
southern 0
West 0
Virginia. 0

This 0

spring, 0
Bible 0
classes 0
such 0
as 0
Trenton’s 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
many 0
here 0
in 0
Mercer 0
County. 0

For 0
decades, 0
the 0
county’s 0
public 0
schools 0
have 0
offered 0
a 0
weekly 0
Bible 0
class 0
during 0
the 0
school 0
day 0
— 0
30 0
minutes 0
at 0
the 0
elementary 0
level 0
and 0
45 0
minutes 0
in 0
middle 0
school. 0

Bible 0
classes 0
on 0
school 0
time 0
are 0
a 0
rarity 0
in 0
public 0
education, 0
but 0
here 0
they 0
are 0
a 0
long-standing 0
tradition. 0

The 0
program 0
is 0
not 0
mandatory, 0
but 0
almost 0
every 0
child 0
in 0
the 0
district 0
attends. 0

And 0
there 0
is 0
widespread 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
classes: 0
Parents 0
and 0
community 0
members 0
help 0
raise 0
nearly 0
$500,000 0
a 0
year 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
the 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools 0
program. 0

Now 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools 0
is 0
facing 0
a 0
stiff 0
legal 0
challenge. 0

Two 0
county 0
residents 0
with 0
school-age 0
children 0
argue 0
in 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
that 0
the 0
program 0
violates 0
the 0
establishment 0
clause 0
of 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
and 0
the 0
West 0
Virginia 0
constitution. 0

Filed 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
amended 0
last 0
month 0
by 0
the 0
Freedom 0
From 0
Religion 0
Foundation, 0
the 0
suit 0
charges 0
that 0
the 0
Bible 0
class 0
“advances 0
and 0
endorses 0
one 0
religion, 0
improperly 0
entangles 0
public 0
schools 0
in 0
religious 0
affairs, 0
and 0
violates 0
the 0
personal 0
consciences 0
of 0
nonreligious 0
and 0
non-Christian 0
parents 0
and 0
students.” 0

Supporters 0

are 0
adamant 0
that 0
the 0
weekly 0
class 0
is 0
an 0
elective 0
meant 0
to 0
explore 0
the 0
history 0
and 0
literature 0
of 0
the 0
Bible, 0
not 0
to 0
promote 0
religious 0
belief. 0

“My 0
experience 0
with 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
very 0
positive. 0

I’ve 0
never 0
known 0
of 0
anyone 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
pressured 0
or 0
felt 0
ostracized,” 0
said 0
the 0
Rev. 0

David 0
W. 0
Dockery, 0
senior 0
pastor 0
at 0
First 0
Baptist 0
Church 0
of 0
Princeton. 0

“Any 0
time 0
God’s 0
word 0
can 0
be 0
proclaimed 0
is 0
beneficial 1
and 0
is 0
a 1
good 1
thing.” 1

Trenton’s 0

parents 0
also 0
find 0
it 0
hard 0
to 0
see 0
why 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
objections. 0

“I 0

think 0
it’s 0
a 0
great 0
program 0
mainly 0
because 0
it’s 0
the 0
only 0
chance 0
for 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
kids 0
to 0
even 0
see 0
the 0
Bible,” 0
said 0
Brett 0
Tolliver, 0
27. 0

“More 0
importantly, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
who 0
it 0
harms. 0

The 0
kids 0
aren’t 0
forced 0
to 0
be 0
there.” 0

Courtney 0

Tolliver, 0
26, 0
a 0
teacher 0
in 0
the 0
district, 0
agrees. 0

“It’s 0

not 0
teaching 0
religion, 0
but 0
it 0
teaches 0
character 0
and 0
respect 0
and 0
how 0
important 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
tell 0
the 0
truth,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“The 0
kids 0
love 0
it 0
and 0
the 0
ones 0
who 0
don’t 0
participate 0
aren’t 0
made 0
to 0
feel 0
left 0
out.” 0

But 0

the 0
plaintiffs 0
in 0
the 0
suit 0
and 0
their 0
backers 0
argue 0
that 0
the 0
program’s 0
popularity 0
shouldn’t 0
matter 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
rulings 0
such 0
as 0
McCollum 0
v. 0
Board 0
of 0
Education 0
in 0
1948 0
that 0
have 0
banned 0
public 0
schools 0
from 0
initiating 0
or 0
sponsoring 0
religious 0
activity. 0

The 0
suit 0
alleges 0
that 0
the 0
lessons 0
in 0
the 0
Mercer 0
schools 0
are 0
similar 0
to 0
what 0
a 0
child 0
would 0
hear 0
in 0
Sunday 0
school 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
advocate 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments 0
and 0
treat 0
stories 0
in 0
the 0
Bible 0
as 0
historical 0
fact. 0

The 0
suit 0
quotes 0
from 0
one 0
lesson: 0
“If 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
Israelites 0
had 0
chosen 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments, 0
think 0
of 0
how 0
safe 0
and 0
happy 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
been.” 0
Another 0
lesson 0
asks 0
students 0
to 0
imagine 0
that 0
humans 0
and 0
dinosaurs 0
existed 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time. 0

It 0
says: 0
“So 0
picture 0
Adam 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
crawl 0
up 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
a 0
dinosaur! 0

He 0
and 0
Eve 0
could 0
have 0
their 0
own 0
personal 0
water 0
slide! 0

Wouldn’t 0
that 0
be 0
so 0
wild!” 0

The 0

district 0
declined 0
a 0
request 0
to 0
observe 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
classes. 0

Elizabeth 0
Deal, 0
who 0
describes 0
herself 0
as 0
agnostic, 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
plaintiffs 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

Her 0
daughter 0
attended 0
elementary 0
school 0
in 0
nearby 0
Bluefield, 0
but 0
Deal 0
kept 0
her 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
Bible 0
class. 0

Even 0
though 0
the 0
class 0
was 0
optional, 0
Deal 0
said 0
there 0
weren’t 0
any 0
alternative 0
lessons 0
or 0
activities 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
opted 0
out. 0

Her 0
daughter 0
was 0
told 0
to 0
sit 0
in 0
the 0
computer 0
lab 0
for 0
that 0
half-hour 0
and 0
read 0
a 0
book. 0

Bypassing 1
the 1
class 1
left 1
her 1
vulnerable 1
to 1
bullying. 1

Deal 0
said 0
other 0
students 0
told 0
her 0
daughter 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
going 1
to 1
hell. 1

One 0
day 0
a 0
student 0
saw 0
her 0
daughter 0
reading 0
a 0
“Harry 0
Potter” 0
novel 0
and 0
told 0
her, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
mother: 0
“You 1
don’t 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
reading 1
this. 1

You 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
reading 1
the 1
Bible.” 1

Eventually 0

Deal 0
moved 0
her 0
daughter 0
to 0
a 0
public 0
school 0
a 0
few 0
miles 0
away 0
in 0
Virginia 0
where 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
Bible 0
class. 0

She 0
pays 0
an 0
out-of-state 0
fee 0
of 0
several 0
hundred 0
dollars, 0
but 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
worries 0
about 0
her 0
child 0
being 0
taunted. 0

Deal 0

said 0
she 0
joined 0
the 0
suit 0
because 0
she 0
believes 0
strongly 1
in 0
the 0
separation 0
of 0
church 0
and 0
state. 0

“When 0
something 0
is 0
wrong,” 0
she 0
said, 0
“you 0
have 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
against 0
it.” 0

God 0
is 0
a 0
big 0
deal 0
in 0
Mercer 0
County, 0
home 0
to 0
about 0
125 0
churches 0
that 0
dominate 0
the 0
main 0
streets 0
of 0
its 0
biggest 0
towns, 0
Princeton 0
(population 0
6,400) 0
and 0
Bluefield 0
(10,400), 0
and 0
smaller 0
burgs 0
such 0
as 0
Athens 0
(1,000), 0
Bramwell 0
(360) 0
and 0
Oakvale 0
(120). 0

A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
jobs 0
in 0
the 0
county 0
have 0
left 0
— 0
22 0
percent 0
of 0
its 0
61,000 0
residents 0
live 0
below 0
the 0
poverty 0
level 0
— 0
but 0
the 0
churches 0
have 0
stayed. 0

You 0
can 0
find 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
God 0
here. 0

And 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
Christ. 0

And 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
Jesus. 0

There 0
are 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
Catholic 0
churches, 0
a 0
synagogue 0
and 0
a 0
mosque, 0
but 0
the 0
vast 0
majority 0
of 0
houses 0
of 0
worship 0
are 0
Baptist, 0
Methodist 0
or 0
Pentecostal. 0

The 0
radio 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
is 0
filled 0
with 0
gospel 0
stations, 0
Bible 0
talk 0
shows 0
and 0
Christian 0
rock. 0

Billboards 0
tout 0
the 0
Ten 0

offer 0
stern 0
messages 0
on 0
abortion 0

The 0

Rev. 0

Ray 0
Hurt 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
lead 0
pastor 0
at 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
God 0
in 0
Princeton 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
two 0
decades. 0

The 0
church, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
largest 0
buildings 0
in 0
town, 0
can 0
hold 0
up 0
to 0
2,000 0
people 0
for 0
Sunday 0
services 0
and 0
often 0
does. 0

For 0
Hurt, 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
schools 0
here 0
in 0
one 0
form 0
or 0
another 0
since 0
1939, 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
way 0
for 0
students 0
to 0
further 0
their 0
knowledge. 0

“There 0

is 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
not 0
just 0
poetry 0
and 0
prose 0
in 0
the 0
Bible, 0
but 0
from 0
what 0
I’ve 0
read 0
almost 0
every 0
piece 0
of 0
history 0
that’s 0
in 0
the 0
Bible 0
has 0
eventually 0
been 0
proven,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“We 0
see 0
the 0
Bible 0
not 0
just 0
as 0
a 0
book 0
of 0
faith 0
but 0
as 0
a 0
pretty 0
accurate 0
account 0
of 0
history 0
that 0
informs 0
us 0
about 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
things 0
that 0
happened.” 0

Hurt, 0

whose 0
son, 0
the 0
Rev. 0

J.B. 0
Hurt, 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
minister 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
God 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
county 0
school 0
board, 0
says 0
he 0
would 0
oppose 0
the 0
program 0
if 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
being 0
used 0
to 0
teach 0
religion 0
or 0
if 0
students 0
were 0
required 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
class. 0

But 0
he 0
also 0
embraces 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
the 0
Bible 0
offers 0
irrefutable 0
lessons 0
in 0
morality 0
and 0
teaches 0
the 0
difference 0
between 0
right 0
and 0
wrong. 0

“If 0

you 0
read 0
the 0
Bible, 0
you’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
good 0
ideas 0
that 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
stick 0
with 0
you 0
and 0
make 0
you 0
a 0
better 0
person,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“You 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
push 0
religion 0
with 0
it. 0

It 0
speaks 0
for 0
itself 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
morals 0
and 0
ethics 0
and 0
those 0
things.” 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
a 0
weekly 0
Bible 0
class 0
for 0
6,600 0
students 0
in 0
16 0
public 0
elementary 0
schools 0
and 0
three 0
middle 0
schools 0
is 0
somehow 0
simply 0
an 0
academic 0

sit 0
well 0
with 0
Lynne 0
White, 0
54, 0
a 0
former 0
two-term 0
school 0
board 0
member 0
and 0
mother 0
of 0
two 0
sons 0
who 0
went 0
through 0
Mercer 0
schools. 0

“As 0

a 0

person 0
of 0
faith 0
myself, 0
I 0
don’t 0
see 0
any 0
problem 0
with 0
having 0
an 0
after-school 0
Bible 0
program,” 0
White 0
said. 0

“But 0
to 0
me 0
this 0
seems 0
a 0
pretty 1
clear 1
violation 0
of 0
the 0
Constitution.” 0

White 0

holds 0
the 0
school 0
board 0
and 0
leadership 0
responsible 0
for 0
spreading 0
what 0
she 0
says 0
is 0
a 0
false 0
sense 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools 0
program 0
is 0
and 0
does. 0

In 0

a 0
commentary 0
for 0
the 0
Charleston 0
Gazette-Mail, 0
White 0
wrote 0
that 0
“the 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0

in 0
Mercer 0
County 0
is 0
being 0
sustained 0
on 0
a 0
foundation 1
of 1
lies.” 1

She 0

argued 0
that 0
the 0
classes 0
are 0
character 0
education 0
based 0
on 0
biblical 0
values, 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
electives 0
because 0
West 0
Virginia 0
doesn’t 0
offer 0
electives 0
in 0
elementary 0
or 0
middle 0
school 0
and 0
that 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
classes 0
are 0
funded 0
by 0
private 0
donations, 0
that 0
doesn’t 0
mean 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
taught 0
during 0
the 0
instructional 0
day. 0

She 0
also 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
untrue 0
that 0
children 0
who 0
didn’t 0
take 0
the 0
class 0
weren’t 0
made 0
to 0
“feel 0
different 0
or 0
ostracized.” 0

When 0
White 0
posted 0
the 0
article 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
she 0
heard 0
from 0
some 0
supporters, 0
but 0
many 0
others 0
questioned 0
her 0
faith. 0

“I 0
will 0

of 0
the 0
local 0

in 0
Princeton 0
says 0
it 0
should 0
stay. 0

“It’s 0

good 0
to 0
be 0
God-fearing 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
you 0
approach 0
it,” 0
said 0
Mohammad 0
Iqbal, 0

the 0

Appalachian 0
Region. 0

“Whether 0
it’s 0
the 0
Bible, 0
whether 0
it’s 0
Koran, 0
whether 0
it’s 0
Torah, 0
whether 0
it’s 0
some 0
other 0
book. 0

But 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
optional, 0
not 0
enforced. 0

If 0
the 0
parents 0
have 0
no 0
objection 0
and 0
the 0
student 0
has 0
no 0
objection, 0
it 0
is 0
okay.” 0

But 0

the 0
program’s 0
fate 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
resolved 0
by 0
popular 0
vote 0
or 0
on 0
Facebook 0

Instead, 0
the 0
question 0
will 0
be 0
tried 0
in 0
the 0
courtroom 0
of 0
Judge 0
David 0
A. 0
Faber 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0

Hiram 0
Sasser, 0
a 0
lawyer 0
at 0
the 0
firm, 0
said 0
the 0
district’s 0
main 0
objective 0
is 0
to 0
allow 0
the 0
Bible 0
course 0
to 0
remain 0
as 0
an 0
elective 0
while 0
making 0
sure 0
it 0
complies 0
with 0
the 0
law. 0

The 0
district 0
filed 0
a 0
motion 0
to 0
dismiss 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“There 0

are 0
two 0
things 0
to 0
look 0
at,” 0
Sasser 0
said. 0

“The 0
first 0
is 0
whether 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
a 0
Bible 0
course 0
at 0
all. 0

And 0
the 0
other 0
is 0
whether 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
the 0
Bible 0
course 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
presently 0
constituted. 0

It’s 0
fair 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
we’re 0
very 0
confident 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
issue. 0

And 0
on 0
the 0
second 0
issue 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

our 0
client 0
is 0
very, 1
very 1
flexible 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
making 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
content 0
is 0
in 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
law.” 0

But 0

the 0
plaintiffs 0
aren’t 0
looking 0
for 0
flexibility. 0

They 0
want 0
the 0
Bible 0
class 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
school 0
day. 0

The 0
program 0
“is 0
unconstitutional 0
at 0
its 0
core 0
and 0
cannot 0
be 0
saved 0
via 0
modifications,” 0
said 0
Patrick 0
Elliott, 0
a 0
lawyer 0
with 0
the 0
Freedom 0
From 0
Religion 0
Foundation. 0

“There 0
is 0
no 0
legally 0
permissible 0
way 0
for 0
Mercer 0
County 0
Schools 0
to 0
continue 0
with 0
any 0
type 0
of 0
program 0
like 0
this.” 0

According 0

to 0
Elliott, 0
the 0
Mercer 0
program 0
is 0
“extremely 1
rare” 0
and 0
there 0
are 0
only 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
districts 0
around 0
the 0
country 0
with 0
similar 0
courses. 0

The 0
amended 0
complaint, 0
Elliott 0
said, 0
seeks 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
school 0
system 0
from 0
“organizing, 0
administering, 0
or 0
otherwise 0
endorsing 0
Bible 0
classes 0
for 0
Mercer 0
County 0
Schools’ 0
students 0
in 0
grades 0
kindergarten 0
through 0
eighth 0
grade.” 0

of 0

Religious 0
Freedom 0
Center 0
at 0

Newseum 0
in 0
Washington, 0
doesn’t 0
foresee 0
the 0
program 0
surviving 0
a 0
court 0
challenge 0
in 0
its 0
current 0
form. 0

“This 0

is 0
a 0
loser 0
for 0
the 0
school 0
district,” 0
Haynes 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
difficult 0
to 0
satisfy 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
in 0
elementary 0
school 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
Bible. 0

Students 0
at 0
that 0
age 0
really 0
aren’t 0
prepared 0
to 0
tell 0
the 0
difference 0
between 0
what 0
is 0
history 0
and 0
what 0
is 0
religious 0
conviction.” 0

Haynes 0

argues 0
that 0
people 0
of 0
faith 0
are 0
doing 0
their 0
religion 0
a 0
disservice 0
when 0
they 0
try 0
to 0
have 0
it 0
taught 0
by 0
a 0
government 0
entity. 0

They 0
would 0
rightly 0
object, 0
he 0
said, 0
if 0
they 0
lived 0
somewhere 0
where 0
they 0
were 0
the 0
religious 0
minority 0
and 0
supporters 0
of 0
another 0
religion 0
wanted 0
a 0
course 0
on 0
their 0
faith 0
taught 0
in 0
public 0
schools. 0

“Even 0

if 0
99.9 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
community 0
want 0
it, 0
they 0
need 0
to 0
remember 0
that 0
liberty 1
of 1
conscience 1
is 1
not 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
vote,” 1
he 0
said. 0

Hanging 0
in 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

what 0
he 0
