Apology 0

Former 0
president 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
has 0
spoken 0
out 0
about 0
what 0
happened 0
during 0
his 0
affair 0
with 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
intern 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky. 0

Among 0
other 0
things, 0
Clinton 0
says 0
Lewinsky 0
is 0
not 0
owed 0
an 0
apology 0
from 0
him 0
and 0
he 0
“did 0
the 0
right 0
thing.” 0

As 0
reported 0
by 0
CNN, 0
Speaking 0
to 0
Today, 0
Clinton 0
defended 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
office 0
following 0
the 0
scandal. 0

“A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
have 0
been 0
conveniently 0
omitted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
story 0
work, 0
I 0
think 0
partly 0
because 0
they’re 0
frustrated 0
that 0
they 0
got 0
all 0
these 0
serious 0
allegations 0
against 0
the 0
current 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office 0
and 0
his 0
voters 0
don’t 0
seem 0
to 0
care,” 0
Clinton 0
said, 0
pointing 0
to 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
sexual 1
misconduct 1
allegations 0
against 0
current 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
who 0
has 0
denied 0
them. 0

“I 0
think 0
I 0
did 0
the 0
right 0
thing. 0

I 0
defended 0
the 0
Constitution.” 0

In 0
an 0
essay 0
for 0
Vanity 0
Fair 0
published 0
earlier 0
this 0
year, 0
Lewinsky 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
questioning 0
the 0
narrative 0
surrounding 0
the 0
affair, 0
which 0
played 0
a 0
central 0
role 0
in 0
Clinton’s 0
eventual 0
impeachment. 0

“Now, 0
at 0
44, 0
I’m 0
beginning 0
(just 0
beginning) 0
to 0
consider 0
the 0
implications 0
of 0
power 0
differentials 0
that 0
were 0
so 0
vast 0
between 0
a 0
president 0
and 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
intern,” 0
she 0
wrote. 0

“I’m 0
beginning 0
to 0
entertain 0
the 0
notion 0
that 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
circumstance 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
consent 0
might 0
well 0
be 0
rendered 0
moot.” 0

When 0
asked 0
if 0
he 0
owed 0
Lewinsky 0
an 0
apology, 0
President 0
Clinton 0
told 0
NBC‘s 0
Craig 0
Melvin, 0
“No, 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
— 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
talked 0
to 0
her. 0

But 0
I 0
did 0
say 0
publicly 0
on 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
occasion 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
sorry. 0

That’s 0
very 0
different. 0

The 0
apology 0
was 0
public.” 0
Although 0
some 0
may 0
not 0
have 0
taken 0
what 0
Clinton 0
said 0
as 0
an 0
apology, 0
he 0
did 0
publicly 0
acknowledge 0
at 0
the 0
National 0
Prayer 0
Breakfast 0
in 0
1998 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
“sinned.” 0

“I 0
don’t 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
fancy 0
way 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
sinned. 0

It 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
everybody 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
hurt 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
sorrow 0
I 0
feel 0
is 0
genuine 0
— 0
first 0
and 0
most 0
important, 0
my 0
family, 0
also 0
my 0
friends, 0
my 0
staff, 0
my 0
Cabinet, 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky 0
and 0
her 0
family, 0
and 0
the 1
American 1
people.” 1
