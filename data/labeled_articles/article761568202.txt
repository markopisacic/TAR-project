happened 0 273 1
during 0 273 1

things, 0 273 2
Clinton 0 273 2
says 0 273 2
Lewinsky 0 273 2
is 0 273 2
not 0 273 2
owed 0 273 2
an 0 273 2
apology 0 273 2
from 0 273 2
him 0 273 2
and 0 273 2

As 0 273 3
reported 0 273 3
by 0 273 3
CNN, 0 273 3
Speaking 0 273 3
to 0 273 3
Today, 0 273 3
Clinton 0 273 3
defended 0 273 3
his 0 273 3
decision 0 273 3
to 0 273 3
remain 0 273 3
in 0 273 3
office 0 273 3
following 0 273 3
the 0 273 3
scandal. 0 273 3

“A 0 273 4
lot 0 273 4
of 0 273 4
the 0 273 4
facts 0 273 4
have 0 273 4
been 0 273 4
conveniently 0 273 4
omitted 0 273 4
to 0 273 4
make 0 273 4
the 0 273 4
story 0 273 4
work, 0 273 4
I 0 273 4
think 0 273 4
partly 0 273 4
because 0 273 4
they’re 0 273 4
frustrated 0 273 4
that 0 273 4
they 0 273 4
got 0 273 4
all 0 273 4
these 0 273 4
serious 0 273 4
allegations 0 273 4
against 0 273 4
the 0 273 4
current 0 273 4
occupant 0 273 4
of 0 273 4
the 0 273 4
Oval 0 273 4
Office 0 273 4
and 0 273 4
his 0 273 4
voters 0 273 4
don’t 0 273 4
seem 0 273 4
to 0 273 4
care,” 0 273 4
Clinton 0 273 4
said, 0 273 4
pointing 0 273 4
to 0 273 4
a 0 273 4
series 0 273 4
of 0 273 4
sexual 1 273 4
misconduct 1 273 4
allegations 0 273 4
against 0 273 4

them. 0 273 4

“I 0 273 5
think 0 273 5
I 0 273 5
did 0 273 5
the 0 273 5
right 0 273 5
thing. 0 273 5

I 0 273 6
defended 0 273 6
the 0 273 6
Constitution.” 0 273 6

In 0 273 7
an 0 273 7
essay 0 273 7
for 0 273 7
Vanity 0 273 7
Fair 0 273 7
published 0 273 7
earlier 0 273 7
this 0 273 7
year, 0 273 7
Lewinsky 0 273 7
said 0 273 7
she 0 273 7
was 0 273 7
questioning 0 273 7
the 0 273 7
narrative 0 273 7
surrounding 0 273 7
the 0 273 7
affair, 0 273 7
which 0 273 7
played 0 273 7
a 0 273 7
central 0 273 7
role 0 273 7
in 0 273 7
Clinton’s 0 273 7
eventual 0 273 7
impeachment. 0 273 7

“Now, 0 273 8
at 0 273 8
44, 0 273 8
I’m 0 273 8
beginning 0 273 8
(just 0 273 8
beginning) 0 273 8
to 0 273 8
consider 0 273 8
the 0 273 8
implications 0 273 8
of 0 273 8
power 0 273 8
differentials 0 273 8
that 0 273 8
were 0 273 8
so 0 273 8
vast 0 273 8
between 0 273 8
a 0 273 8
president 0 273 8
and 0 273 8
a 0 273 8
White 0 273 8
House 0 273 8
intern,” 0 273 8
she 0 273 8
wrote. 0 273 8

“I’m 0 273 9
beginning 0 273 9
to 0 273 9
entertain 0 273 9
the 0 273 9
notion 0 273 9
that 0 273 9
in 0 273 9
such 0 273 9
a 0 273 9
circumstance 0 273 9
the 0 273 9
idea 0 273 9
of 0 273 9
consent 0 273 9
might 0 273 9
well 0 273 9
be 0 273 9
rendered 0 273 9
moot.” 0 273 9

When 0 273 10
asked 0 273 10
if 0 273 10
he 0 273 10
owed 0 273 10
Lewinsky 0 273 10
an 0 273 10
apology, 0 273 10
President 0 273 10
Clinton 0 273 10
told 0 273 10
NBC‘s 0 273 10
Craig 0 273 10
Melvin, 0 273 10
“No, 0 273 10
I 0 273 10
do 0 273 10
not 0 273 10
— 0 273 10
I 0 273 10
have 0 273 10
never 0 273 10
talked 0 273 10
to 0 273 10
her. 0 273 10

But 0 273 11
I 0 273 11
did 0 273 11
say 0 273 11
publicly 0 273 11
on 0 273 11
more 0 273 11
than 0 273 11
one 0 273 11
occasion 0 273 11
that 0 273 11
I 0 273 11
was 0 273 11
sorry. 0 273 11

That’s 0 273 12
very 0 273 12
different. 0 273 12

The 0 273 13
apology 0 273 13
was 0 273 13
public.” 0 273 13
Although 0 273 13
some 0 273 13
may 0 273 13
not 0 273 13
have 0 273 13
taken 0 273 13
what 0 273 13
Clinton 0 273 13
said 0 273 13
as 0 273 13
an 0 273 13
apology, 0 273 13
he 0 273 13
did 0 273 13
publicly 0 273 13
acknowledge 0 273 13
at 0 273 13
the 0 273 13
National 0 273 13
Prayer 0 273 13
Breakfast 0 273 13
in 0 273 13
1998 0 273 13
that 0 273 13
he 0 273 13
had 0 273 13
“sinned.” 0 273 13

“I 0 273 14
don’t 0 273 14
think 0 273 14
there 0 273 14
is 0 273 14
a 0 273 14
fancy 0 273 14
way 0 273 14
to 0 273 14
say 0 273 14
that 0 273 14
I 0 273 14
have 0 273 14
sinned. 0 273 14

It 0 273 15
is 0 273 15
important 0 273 15
to 0 273 15
me 0 273 15
that 0 273 15
everybody 0 273 15
who 0 273 15
has 0 273 15
been 0 273 15
hurt 0 273 15

that 0 273 15
the 0 273 15
sorrow 0 273 15
I 0 273 15
feel 0 273 15
is 0 273 15
genuine 0 273 15
— 0 273 15
first 0 273 15
and 0 273 15
most 0 273 15
important, 0 273 15
my 0 273 15
family, 0 273 15
also 0 273 15
my 0 273 15
friends, 0 273 15
my 0 273 15
staff, 0 273 15
my 0 273 15
Cabinet, 0 273 15
Monica 0 273 15
Lewinsky 0 273 15
and 0 273 15
her 0 273 15

American 1 273 15
