Jim 0
Acosta 0
has 0
his 0
press 0
pass 0
back. 0

The 0

Trump 0
administration 0
stood 0
down 0
on 0
Monday 0
from 0
its 0
nearly 0
two-week-long 0
dispute 0
with 0
CNN 0
over 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
credentials 0
of 0
Mr. 0
Acosta, 0
informing 0
the 0
correspondent 0
that 0
his 0
badge 0
was 0
formally 0
restored. 0

CNN 0
in 0
turn 0
dropped 0
its 0
lawsuit 0
on 0
the 0
matter, 0
which 0
had 0
ballooned 1
into 0
a 0
test 0
of 0
press 0
freedoms 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
era. 0

But 0

while 0
it 0
yielded 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
— 0
whose 0
testy 1
questions 0
had 0
touched 0
off 0
Mr. 0
Trump’s 0
ire 1
— 0
the 0
administration 0
used 0
the 0
occasion 0
to 0
lay 0
down 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
formal 0
rules 0
governing 0
reporters’ 0
behavior 0
at 0
future 0
White 0
House 0
news 0
conferences, 0
a 0
highly 0
unusual 0
step. 0

Among 0

the 0
guidelines 0
was 0
a 0
restriction 0
of 0
one 0
question 0
per 0
reporter, 0
with 0
follow-ups 0
allowed 0
at 0
the 0
discretion 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
or 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
official 0
at 0
the 0
lectern. 0

“Failure 0
to 0
abide,” 0
the 0
administration 0
warned, 0
“may 0
result 0
in 0
suspension 0
or 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
hard 0
pass.” 0

The 0

White 0
House 0
sought 0
to 0
blame 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
for 0
behaving 0
disrespectfully, 0
although 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
often 0
lobs 0
insults 1
at 0
journalists 0
and 0
encourages 0
a 0
free-for-all 0
format 0
when 0
taking 0
questions 0
from 0
reporters. 0

Codifying 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
journalists 0
struck 0
some 0
as 0
an 0
ominous 1
encroachment 1
into 0
freedom 0
of 0
the 0
press, 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
said 0
on 0
Monday 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
not 0
been 0
consulted 0
about 0
the 0
new 0
guidelines. 0

The 0

American 0
Civil 0
Liberties 0
Union, 0
in 0
a 0
statement, 0
said: 0
“These 0
rules 0
give 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
far 0
too 0
much 0
discretion 0
to 0
avoid 0
real 0
scrutiny. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
belongs 0
to 0
the 0
public, 0
not 0
the 0
president, 0
and 0
the 0
job 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
is 0
to 0
ask 0
hard 0
questions, 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
polite 0
company.” 0

Still, 0
the 0
guidelines 0
are 0
not 0
far 0
removed 0
from 0
the 0
manner 0
in 0
which 0
White 0
House 0
news 0
conferences 0
typically 0
proceed. 0

Mr. 0
Trump 0
made 0
clear 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
introduce 0
“regulations” 0
after 0
a 0
federal 0
judge 0
criticized 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
for 0
stripping 0
Mr. 0
Acosta’s 0
credentials 0
without 0
due 0
process 0
or 0
a 0
coherent 0
rationale. 0

“We 0

would 0
have 0
greatly 0
preferred 0
to 0
continue 0
hosting 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
understood 0
professional 0
norms, 0
and 0
we 0
believe 0
the 0
overwhelming 0
majority 0
of 0
journalists 0
covering 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
share 0
that 0
preference,” 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders, 0
the 0
press 0
secretary, 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

Press 0

relations 0
were 0
not 0
always 0
rosy 0
in 0
pre-Trump 0
days. 0

President 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
aides 0
preselected 0
the 0
news 0
outlets 0
that 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
ask 0
questions 0
at 0
his 0
news 0
conferences. 0

Mr. 0
Obama 0
often 0
chastised 0
reporters, 0
including 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
on 0
one 0
occasion, 0
for 0
questions 0
he 0
deemed 0
overly 1
aggressive 1
or 0
grandstanding. 1

But 0
Mr. 0
Trump, 0
a 0
devoted 1
news 1
consumer 1
who 0
relishes 0
his 0
coverage, 0
plays 0
up 0
his 0
conflicts 0
with 0
reporters 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
excite 0
his 0
supporters. 0

He 0
has 0
held 0
far 0
fewer 0
formal 0
news 0
conferences 0
than 0
his 0
predecessors, 0
and 0
the 0
daily 0
White 0
House 0
briefing 0
has 0
virtually 0
disappeared 0
on 0
his 0
watch. 0

Revoking 0

Mr. 0
Acosta’s 0
White 0
House 0
badge 0
was 0
the 0
most 0
severe 1
step 0
yet, 0
and 0
it 0
soon 0
became 0
apparent 0
that 0
the 0
move 0
would 0
not 0
pass 0
legal 0
muster: 0
After 0
suing 0
last 0
week, 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
was 0
granted 0
the 0
temporary 0
return 0
of 0
his 0
credentials 0
by 0
a 0
federal 0
judge. 0

A 0

back-and-forth 0
ensued 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

Bill 0
Shine, 0
the 0
deputy 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
for 0
communications, 0
sent 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
that 0
listed 0
several 0
reasons 0
that 0
his 0
pass 0
had 0
been 0
revoked, 0
perhaps 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
satisfy 0
the 0
judge’s 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
clear 0
rationale. 0

CNN’s 0
lawyers 0
called 0
the 0
note 0
an 0
“after-the-fact 0
concocted 0
process.” 0
By 0
Monday 0
afternoon, 0
the 0
sides 0
had 0
reached 0
a 0
resolution. 0

Aides 0

to 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
does 0
not 0
mind 0
answering 0
questions, 0
pointing 0
to 0
his 0
numerous 0
impromptu 0
sessions 0
with 0
reporters 0
during 0
White 0
House 0
photo-ops 0
and 0
Marine 0
One 0
departures. 0

The 0
aides 0
complain 0
about 0
reporters 0
who 0
they 0
say 0
do 0
not 0
respect 0
the 0
solemnity 0
of 0
the 0
setting, 0
even 0
as 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
flouts 1
many 0
of 0
the 0
norms 0
associated 0
with 0
his 0
office. 0

“The 0

White 0
House’s 0
interaction 0
is, 0
and 0
generally 0
should 0
be, 0
subject 0
to 0
a 0
natural 0
give-and-take,” 0
Ms. 0
Sanders 0
wrote 0
on 0
Monday, 0
suggesting 0
that 0
the 0
onus 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
press 0
corps 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
a 0
“code 0
of 0
conduct” 0
did 0
not 0
become 0
necessary. 0

That 0

notion 0
read 0
more 0
like 0
a 0
warning 0
— 0
behave 1
or 1
else 1
— 0
and 0
the 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
seemed 0
unmoved. 0

“For 0

as 0
long 0
as 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
conferences, 0
White 0
House 0
reporters 0
have 0
asked 0
follow-up 0
questions,” 0
the 0
group 0
wrote 0
on 0
Monday. 0

“We 0
fully 0
expect 0
this 0
tradition 0
will 0
continue.” 0
