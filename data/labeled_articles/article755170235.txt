to 0
fundamentally 0
shift 0
U.S. 0
policy 0
towards 0
Iran 0
and 0
has 0
found 0
a 0

in 0
the 0
Trump 0

which 0
has 0
been 0
moving 0
in 0
this 0

since 0
Bolton—a 0
longtime 0
and 0
vocal 0
supporter 0
of 0
regime 0
change—entered 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

It 0
deemphasizes 0
U.S 0
military 0
intervention, 0
instead 0
focusing 0
on 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
moves 0
to 0
embolden 0
an 0
Iranian 0
population 0
that 0
has 0
increasingly 0
grown 0
angry 0
at 0
the 0
ruling 0

for 0
its 0

“The 0

For 0
now 0
– 0
at 0

– 0
overthrowing 0
the 0
Iran 0
government, 0
with 0
its 0
extensive 0

close 0

to 0
the 0
Kremlin, 0
is 0
not 0
official 0
US 0
policy; 0
SSG 0
president 0
Jim 0
Hanson 0
told 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
direct 0
military 0
intervention 0
in 0
Iran 0
– 0
and 0
is 0
instead 0
focusing 0
on 0
other 0
methods 0
of 0
ridding 0
Iran 0
of 0
its 0
“hardline 0
ruling 0
regime.” 0

“The 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
no 0
desire 0
to 0
roll 0
tanks 0
in 0
an 0
effort 0
to 0
directly 0
topple 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime,” 0
Hanson 0
said. 0

“But 0
they 0
would 0
be 0
much 0
happier 0
dealing 0
with 0
a 0
post-Mullah 0
government. 0

That 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
likely 0
path 0
to 0
a 0
nuclear 0
weapons-free 0
and 0
less 0
dangerous 0
Iran.” 0

That 1
will 1
likely 1
change, 1
however. 1

One 0
source 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
who 0
has 0
previewed 0
the 0
plan 0
told 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
that 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
also 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
solidified 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
grip 0
on 0
power 0
and 0
intentionally 0
prevented 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
from 0
fomenting 0
regime 0
change 0

“The 0
JCPOA 0
purposefully 0
destroyed 0
the 0
carefully 0
created 0
global 0
consensus 0
against 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic,” 0
said 0
the 0
source, 0
who 0
would 0
only 0
speak 0
to 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
on 0
background 0
about 0
the 0
sensitive 0
issue. 0

“Prior 0
to 0
that, 0
everyone 0
understood 0
the 0
dangers 0
of 0
playing 0
footsie 0
with 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
state 0
sponsor 0
of 0
terrorism. 0

It’s 0
now 0
Trump, 0
Bolton, 0
and 0
[Mike] 0
Pompeo’s 0
job 0
to 0
put 0
this 0
consensus 0
back 0
in 0

The 0
source 0
tells 0
the 0
Beacon 0
that 0
Bolton 0
is 0
“acutely 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
danger 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
poses 0
to 0
the 0
region.” 0

“John 0
is 0
someone 0
who 0
understands 0
the 0
danger 0
of 0
Iran 0
viscerally, 0
and 0
knows 0
that 0
you’re 0
never 0
going 0
to 0
fundamentally 0
change 0
its 0
behavior—and 0
the 0
threats 0
against 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Saudis 0
especially—until 0
that 0
revolutionary 0
regime 0
is 0
gone,” 0
the 0

adding 0
that 0
“nothing’s 0
off 0
the 0
table 0
right 0
now 0
if 0
Israel 0
is 0
attacked.” 0

That 0
said, 0
Bolton 0
is 0
confident 0
that 0
an 0
Iranian 0
regime 0

will 0
occur 0
in 0
the 0
next 0

A 0
second 0
source 0
tells 0
The 0
Beacon 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
recognizes 0
that 0
the 0
“chief 0
impediment 0
to 0
the 0
region 0
is 0
Iran’s 0
tyrannical 1
regime.” 1

“The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
it’s 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime,” 0
said 0
the 0
source. 0

“Team 0
Bolton 0
has 0
spent 0
years 0
creating 0
Plans 0
B, 0
C, 0
and 0
D 0
for 0
dealing 0
with 0
that 0
problem. 0

President 0
Trump 0
hired 0
him 0
knowing 0
all 0
of 0
that. 0

The 0
administration 0
will 0
now 0
start 0
aggressively 1
moving 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
root 0
cause 0
of 0
chaos 0
and 0
violence 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
in 0
a 0
clear-eyed 0
way.” 0

Regional 0
sources 0
who 0
have 0
spoken 0
to 0
SSG 0
“tell 0
us 0
that 0
Iranian 0
social 0
media 0
is 0
more 0
outraged 0
about 0
internal 0
oppression, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
recent 0
restrictions 0
on 0
Telegram, 0
than 0
about 0
supporting 0
or 0
opposing 0
the 0
nuclear 0
program. 0

Iranian 0
regime 0
oppression 0
of 0
its 0
ethnic 0
and 0
religious 0
minorities 0
has 0
created 0
the 0
conditions 0
for 0
an 0
effective 0
campaign 0
designed 0
to 0
splinter 0
the 0
Iranian 0
state 0
into 0
component 0
parts,” 0
the 0
group 0
states. 0

–Free 0
Beacon 0

“More 0
than 0
one 0
third 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
population 0
is 0
minority 0
groups, 0
many 0
of 0
whom 0
already 0
seek 0
independence,” 0
the 0
paper 0
explains. 0

“U.S. 0

support 0
for 0
these 0
independence 0
movements, 0
both 0
overt 0
and 0
covert, 0
could 0
force 0
the 0
regime 0
to 0
focus 0
attention 0
on 0
them 0
and 0
limit 0
its 0
ability 0
to 0
conduct 0
other 0
malign 0
activities.” 0

Without 0
a 0
regime 0
change, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
will 0
continue 0
face 0
threats 0
from 0
Iranian 0
forces 0
stationed 0
throughout 0
the 0
region, 0
including 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Yemen, 0
Syria, 0
and 0
Lebanon. 0

“The 0
probability 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
theocracy 0
will 0
stop 0
its 0
nuclear 0
program 0
willingly 0
or 0
even 0
under 0
significant 0
pressure 0
is 0
low,” 0
the 0
plan 0
states. 0

“Absent 0
a 0
change 0
in 0
government 0
within 0
Iran, 0
America 1
will 1
face 1
a 1
choice 1
between 1
accepting 1
a 1
nuclear-armed 1
Iran 1
or 1
acting 1
to 1
destroy 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
this 1
capability 1
as 1
possible.” 1

That 0
said, 0
President 0
Trump 0
made 0
clear 0
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
week 0
that 0
US 0
officials 0
must 0
make 0
efforts 0
to 0
differentiate 0
between 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
ruling 0
regime. 0

“Any 0
public 0
discussion 0
of 0
these 0
options, 0
and 0
any 0
messaging 0
about 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
in 0
general, 0
should 0
make 0
a 0
bright 0
line 0
distinction 0
between 0
the 0
theocratic 0
regime 0
along 0
with 0
its 0
organs 0
of 0
oppression 0
and 0
the 0
general 0
populace,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
plan. 0

“We 0
must 0
constantly 0
reinforce 0
our 0
support 0
for 0
removing 0
the 0
iron 0
sandal 0
from 0
the 0
necks 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
to 0
