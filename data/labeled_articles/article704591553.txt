had 1 82 4
prior 1 82 4

sabotage 1 82 4

This 0 82 5
is 0 82 5
the 0 82 5
atmosphere 0 82 5
that 0 82 5
Jewish 0 82 5
students 0 82 5
and 0 82 5
supporters 0 82 5
of 0 82 5

on 0 82 5

daily 0 82 5
basis 0 82 5
at 0 82 5
McGill. 0 82 5

The 1 82 6
toxic 1 82 6
environment 1 82 6
is 0 82 6
due 0 82 6
almost 0 82 6
exclusively 0 82 6
to 0 82 6
an 0 82 6
active 0 82 6
and 0 82 6
vocal 0 82 6
presence 0 82 6
of 0 82 6
BDS 1 82 6
agitators 1 82 6
on 0 82 6
campus. 0 82 6

Lew 0 82 7
followed 0 82 7
the 0 82 7
advice 0 82 7
and 0 82 7
was 0 82 7
elected 0 82 7
as 0 82 7
a 0 82 7
board 0 82 7
member. 0 82 7

His 0 82 8
“secret” 0 82 8
was 0 82 8
intact. 0 82 8

BDS 1 82 9
provocateurs 1 82 9
at 0 82 9
McGill 0 82 9
had 0 82 9
relentlessly 0 82 9
tried 0 82 9
and 0 82 9
failed 0 82 9
to 0 82 9
pass 0 82 9
boycott 0 82 9

against 0 82 9
Israel. 0 82 9

In 0 82 10

three 0 82 10
attempts 0 82 10
within 0 82 10
an 0 82 10
18-month 0 82 10

were 1 82 10
quashed. 1 82 10

Finally, 0 82 11
in 0 82 11
June 0 82 11
2016, 0 82 11
SSMU’s 0 82 11
Judicial 0 82 11
Board 0 82 11

that 0 82 11

The 0 82 12
Board’s 0 82 12
ruling, 0 82 12
which 0 82 12
is 0 82 12
called 0 82 12
a 0 82 12
“reference,” 0 82 12

referred 0 82 12
to 0 82 12
SSMU’s 0 82 12

SSMU’s 0 82 13

of 0 82 13
Directors 0 82 13
addressed 0 82 13
the 0 82 13
issue 0 82 13
more 0 82 13
than 0 82 13
a 0 82 13
year 0 82 13
after 0 82 13
the 0 82 13

Lew 0 82 13
and 0 82 13
other 0 82 13
board 0 82 13
members 0 82 13
passionately 1 82 13
advocated 1 82 13
in 0 82 13
favor 0 82 13
of 0 82 13
ratification 0 82 13
and 0 82 13
their 0 82 13
arguments 0 82 13
ultimately 0 82 13
prevailed 0 82 13
over 0 82 13
the 0 82 13
naysayers. 0 82 13

The 1 82 14
malevolent 1 82 14
BDS 1 82 14
campaign 1 82 14
at 0 82 14
McGill 0 82 14
had 0 82 14
belatedly 0 82 14
come 0 82 14
to 0 82 14
an 0 82 14
ignominious 1 82 14
end; 1 82 14
or 0 82 14
so 0 82 14
we 0 82 14
thought. 0 82 14

Lew 0 82 15
and 0 82 15
two 0 82 15

as 0 82 15
either 0 82 15
Jewish 0 82 15
or 0 82 15
pro-Israel 0 82 15
became 0 82 15
instant 0 82 15
targets 0 82 15
of 0 82 15
a 1 82 15
campaign 1 82 15
of 1 82 15
hate 1 82 15
laced 1 82 15
with 1 82 15
blatant 1 82 15
anti-Semitic 1 82 15
overtones. 1 82 15

Campus 0 82 16
BDS 0 82 16
groups 0 82 16
held 0 82 16
several 0 82 16
meetings 0 82 16
to 0 82 16
formulate 0 82 16
a 0 82 16
response 0 82 16
and 0 82 16
founded 0 82 16
the 0 82 16
so-called 0 82 16
“Democratize 0 82 16

movement. 0 82 16

But 1 82 17
Democratize 1 82 17
SSMU 1 82 17
was 1 82 17
anything 1 82 17
but 1 82 17
democratic. 1 82 17

Its 0 82 18
raison 0 82 18

the 0 82 18

As 0 82 19
a 0 82 19

position 0 82 19
as 0 82 19
an 0 82 19

to 0 82 19
have 0 82 19

Sadikov 0 82 20
made 0 82 20
light 0 82 20
of 0 82 20
his 0 82 20
“punch 1 82 20

calling 0 82 20
it 0 82 20
a 0 82 20
“misguided 1 82 20
joke.” 1 82 20
It 0 82 20
does 0 82 20
not 0 82 20
appear 0 82 20
that 0 82 20
Sadikov 0 82 20

despite 0 82 20
the 0 82 20
fact 0 82 20
that 0 82 20
his 0 82 20
call 0 82 20
for 0 82 20
violence 0 82 20
violated 0 82 20

McGill’s 0 82 21

two 0 82 21

as 0 82 22
a 0 82 22
reason 0 82 22
for 0 82 22
his 0 82 22
removal. 0 82 22

An 1 82 23
enlightened, 1 82 23
progressive 1 82 23
school 1 82 23
was 1 82 23
suddenly 1 82 23
transformed 1 82 23
into 1 82 23
something 1 82 23
harking 1 82 23
back 1 82 23
to 1 82 23
the 1 82 23
days 1 82 23
of 1 82 23
Nazi 1 82 23
Germany 1 82 23
and 1 82 23
the 1 82 23
Nuremberg 1 82 23
Laws. 1 82 23

In 0 82 24
October, 0 82 24
SSMU’s 0 82 24
General 0 82 24
Assembly 0 82 24
moved 0 82 24
to 0 82 24
ratify 0 82 24
the 0 82 24
12-member 0 82 24
Board 0 82 24
of 0 82 24

According 0 82 25
to 0 82 25
Lew, 0 82 25
“historically, 0 82 25
the 0 82 25
Board 0 82 25
of 0 82 25

had 0 82 25
been 0 82 25

a 0 82 25

all 0 82 25

at 0 82 25
a 0 82 25
time.” 0 82 25
But 0 82 25
BDS 0 82 25
activists 0 82 25
who 0 82 25
showed 0 82 25
up 0 82 25
for 0 82 25
the 0 82 25
General 0 82 25
Assembly 0 82 25
ratification 0 82 25
forced 0 82 25
the 0 82 25
voting 0 82 25
to 0 82 25
occur 0 82 25
on 0 82 25
an 0 82 25
individual 0 82 25
basis 0 82 25
rather 0 82 25
than 0 82 25
a 0 82 25
block 0 82 25
as 0 82 25
was 0 82 25
the 0 82 25
accepted 0 82 25
protocol. 0 82 25

In 0 82 26
this 0 82 26
manner, 0 82 26
BDS/ 0 82 26
Democratize 0 82 26
SSMU 0 82 26
activists 0 82 26
managed 0 82 26
to 0 82 26
pick 0 82 26
off 0 82 26
their 0 82 26
opponents 0 82 26
one 0 82 26
at 0 82 26
a 0 82 26
time. 0 82 26

It 0 82 27
was 0 82 27
repulsive 1 82 27
display 1 82 27
leftist-fascist 1 82 27
bigotry 1 82 27
at 1 82 27
its 1 82 27
worst. 1 82 27

The 1 82 28
bigoted 1 82 28
BDS 1 82 28
provocateurs 1 82 28
applauded 0 82 28
as 0 82 28
Lew 0 82 28
and 0 82 28
the 0 82 28
other 0 82 28
two 0 82 28
board 0 82 28

were 0 82 28
removed 0 82 28
from 0 82 28

But 0 82 29
this 0 82 29
time, 0 82 29
they 0 82 29
may 0 82 29
have 0 82 29
gone 0 82 29
too 0 82 29
far. 0 82 29

Even 0 82 30
by 0 82 30
BDS 0 82 30
standards, 0 82 30
their 1 82 30
manifestly 1 82 30
anti-Semitic 1 82 30
campaign 1 82 30
antics 1 82 30
were 1 82 30
beyond 1 82 30
the 1 82 30
pale. 1 82 30

BDS 0 82 31
activists 0 82 31
generally 0 82 31
avoid 0 82 31
reference 0 82 31
to 0 82 31
“Jews” 0 82 31
by 0 82 31
name 0 82 31
because 0 82 31
it 0 82 31
is 0 82 31
impolitic 0 82 31
and 0 82 31
commonly 0 82 31
substitute 0 82 31
“Zionists” 0 82 31
for 0 82 31
Jews 0 82 31
even 0 82 31
though 0 82 31
most 0 82 31
of 0 82 31

cognizant 0 82 31
of 0 82 31

But 0 82 32
in 0 82 32
the 0 82 32
instant 0 82 32
case, 0 82 32
McGill’s 0 82 32
BDS 0 82 32
campaigners 0 82 32
dispensed 0 82 32
with 0 82 32
their 0 82 32
traditional 0 82 32
charade 1 82 32
and 0 82 32
overtly 0 82 32
launched 0 82 32
their 0 82 32
attack 0 82 32
against 0 82 32

The 1 82 33
vitriolic 1 82 33
BDS 1 82 33
campaign 1 82 33
immediately 0 82 33
sparked 1 82 33
outrage 1 82 33
among 0 82 33
watchdog 0 82 33
groups 0 82 33
and 0 82 33
politicians 0 82 33
prompting 0 82 33
McGill 0 82 33
principal, 0 82 33
Suzanne 0 82 33
Fortier, 0 82 33
to 0 82 33
