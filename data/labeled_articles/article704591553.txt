An 0
Anti-Semitic 0
Purge 0
At 0
McGill 0
University 0

​Despite 0
suffering 0
several 0
public 1
and 1
humiliating 1
reversals 1
in 0
various 0
forums 0
and 0
venues, 0
those 0
pushing 0
for 0
boycotts, 0
divestment 0
and 0
sanctions 0
(BDS) 0
against 0
Israel 0
have 0
not 0
dispensed 0
with 0
their 0
pernicious 1
campaign 1
of 1
hate. 1

The 0
latest 0
outrage 1
perpetrated 0
by 0
BDS 0
activists 0
occurred 0
at 0
McGill 0
University, 0
where 0
a 0
Jewish 0
student 0
and 0
two 0
non-Jewish 0
students 0
identified 0
as 0
pro-Israel 0
were 0
removed 0
from 0
their 0
positions 0
as 0
directors 0
of 0
the 0
Students 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
(SSMU). 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
his 0
second 0
year, 0
Noah 0
Lew, 0
who 0
is 0
currently 0
third 0
year 0
undergraduate 0
student 0
at 0
McGill 0
University, 0
applied 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
School’s 0
student 0
society. 0

He 1
was 1
warned 1
by 1
others 1
who 1
had 1
prior 1
dealings 1
with 1
the 1
SSMU, 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
Jewish 1
identity 1
secret 1
lest 1
he 1
sabotage 1
his 1
chances. 1

This 0
is 0
the 0
atmosphere 0
that 0
Jewish 0
students 0
and 0
supporters 0
of 0
Israel 0
must 0
endure 0
on 0
a 0
daily 0
basis 0
at 0
McGill. 0

The 1
toxic 1
environment 1
is 0
due 0
almost 0
exclusively 0
to 0
an 0
active 0
and 0
vocal 0
presence 0
of 0
BDS 1
agitators 1
on 0
campus. 0

Lew 0
followed 0
the 0
advice 0
and 0
was 0
elected 0
as 0
a 0
board 0
member. 0

His 0
“secret” 0
was 0
intact. 0

BDS 1
provocateurs 1
at 0
McGill 0
had 0
relentlessly 0
tried 0
and 0
failed 0
to 0
pass 0
boycott 0
resolutions 0
against 0
Israel. 0

In 0
fact, 0
three 0
attempts 0
within 0
an 0
18-month 0
period 0
were 1
quashed. 1

Finally, 0
in 0
June 0
2016, 0
SSMU’s 0
Judicial 0
Board 0
ruled 0
that 0
the 0
BDS 0
campaign 0
and 0
efforts 0
to 0
institute 0
it 0
at 0
McGill 0
ran 0
counter 0
to 0
the 0
McGill’s 0
undergraduate 0
student 0
union 0
constitution. 0

The 0
Board’s 0
ruling, 0
which 0
is 0
called 0
a 0
“reference,” 0
was 0
then 0
referred 0
to 0
SSMU’s 0
directors 0
for 0
ratification. 0

SSMU’s 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
addressed 0
the 0
issue 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
after 0
the 0
“reference.” 0
Lew 0
and 0
other 0
board 0
members 0
passionately 1
advocated 1
in 0
favor 0
of 0
ratification 0
and 0
their 0
arguments 0
ultimately 0
prevailed 0
over 0
the 0
naysayers. 0

The 1
malevolent 1
BDS 1
campaign 1
at 0
McGill 0
had 0
belatedly 0
come 0
to 0
an 0
ignominious 1
end; 1
or 0
so 0
we 0
thought. 0

Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
directors 0
identified 0
as 0
either 0
Jewish 0
or 0
pro-Israel 0
became 0
instant 0
targets 0
of 0
a 1
campaign 1
of 1
hate 1
laced 1
with 1
blatant 1
anti-Semitic 1
overtones. 1

Campus 0
BDS 0
groups 0
held 0
several 0
meetings 0
to 0
formulate 0
a 0
response 0
and 0
founded 0
the 0
so-called 0
“Democratize 0
SSMU” 0
movement. 0

But 1
Democratize 1
SSMU 1
was 1
anything 1
but 1
democratic. 1

Its 0
raison 0
d'être 0
was 0
to 0
seek 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0
Jewish 0
and 0
anti-BDS 0
students 0
from 0
SSMU’s 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
and 0
place 0
BDS 0
back 0
on 0
the 0
agenda. 0

As 0
an 0
aside, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
more 0
vocal 0
proponents 0
of 0
BDS 0
at 0
McGill 0
is 0
a 0
rancid 0
character 0
named 0
Igor 0
Sadikov, 0
who 0
in 0
February 0
posted 0
a 0
comment 0
on 0
twitter 0
advocating 0
violence 0
against 0
“Zionists.” 0
As 0
a 0
result, 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
resign 0
his 0
position 0
as 0
an 0
SSMU 0
director 0
but 0
dodged 0
an 0
impeachment 0
effort 0
to 0
have 0
him 0
stripped 0
of 0
his 0
position 0
at 0
McGill’s 0
Arts 0
Undergraduate 0
Society. 0

Sadikov 0
made 0
light 0
of 0
his 0
“punch 1
a 1
Zionist” 1
tweet 0
calling 0
it 0
a 0
“misguided 1
joke.” 1
It 0
does 0
not 0
appear 0
that 0
Sadikov 0
was 0
subjected 0
to 0
any 0
form 0
of 0
school 0
disciplinary 0
action 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
his 0
call 0
for 0
violence 0
violated 0
McGill’s 0
Code 0
of 0
Conduct. 0

McGill’s 0
BDS 0
Action 0
Network 0
actively 0
campaigned 0
against 0
Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
board 0
members 0
because 0
of 0
their 0
links 0
to 0
Jewish 0
groups 0
and 0
anti-BDS 0
stances. 0

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
shamefully 1
highlighted 0
Lew’s 0
ethnicity 0
as 0
a 0
reason 0
for 0
his 0
removal. 0

An 1
enlightened, 1
progressive 1
school 1
was 1
suddenly 1
transformed 1
into 1
something 1
harking 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
Nazi 1
Germany 1
and 1
the 1
Nuremberg 1
Laws. 1

In 0
October, 0
SSMU’s 0
General 0
Assembly 0
moved 0
to 0
ratify 0
the 0
12-member 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors. 0

According 0
to 0
Lew, 0
“historically, 0
the 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
had 0
been 0
ratified 0
as 0
a 0
bloc, 0
all 0
12 0
at 0
a 0
time.” 0
But 0
BDS 0
activists 0
who 0
showed 0
up 0
for 0
the 0
General 0
Assembly 0
ratification 0
forced 0
the 0
voting 0
to 0
occur 0
on 0
an 0
individual 0
basis 0
rather 0
than 0
a 0
block 0
as 0
was 0
the 0
accepted 0
protocol. 0

In 0
this 0
manner, 0
BDS/ 0
Democratize 0
SSMU 0
activists 0
managed 0
to 0
pick 0
off 0
their 0
opponents 0
one 0
at 0
a 0
time. 0

It 0
was 0
repulsive 1
display 1
leftist-fascist 1
bigotry 1
at 1
its 1
worst. 1

The 1
bigoted 1
BDS 1
provocateurs 1
applauded 0
as 0
Lew 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
two 0
board 0
members 0
were 0
removed 0
from 0
their 0
posts. 0

But 0
this 0
time, 0
they 0
may 0
have 0
gone 0
too 0
far. 0

Even 0
by 0
BDS 0
standards, 0
their 1
manifestly 1
anti-Semitic 1
campaign 1
antics 1
were 1
beyond 1
the 1
pale. 1

BDS 0
activists 0
generally 0
avoid 0
reference 0
to 0
“Jews” 0
by 0
name 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
impolitic 0
and 0
commonly 0
substitute 0
“Zionists” 0
for 0
Jews 0
even 0
though 0
most 0
of 0
us 0
are 0
cognizant 0
of 0
their 0
true 0
intentions. 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
instant 0
case, 0
McGill’s 0
BDS 0
campaigners 0
dispensed 0
with 0
their 0
traditional 0
charade 1
and 0
overtly 0
launched 0
their 0
attack 0
against 0
Jews. 0

The 1
vitriolic 1
BDS 1
campaign 1
immediately 0
sparked 1
outrage 1
among 0
watchdog 0
groups 0
and 0
politicians 0
prompting 0
McGill 0
principal, 0
Suzanne 0
Fortier, 0
to 0
announce 0
that 0
the 0
school 0
would 0
be 0
conducting 0
an 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
matter. 0

Even 0
SSMU 0
president, 0
Muna 0
Tojiboeva, 0
voiced 0
support 0
for 0
Lew 0
and 0
expressed 0
the 0
belief 0
that 0
antisemitism 0
played 0
a 0
key 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
ousting 0
the 0
three 0
board 0
members. 0

One 0
can 0
only 0
hope 0
that 0
Fortier 0
takes 0
the 0
issue 0
seriously 0
and 0
conducts 0
a 0
proper 0
investigation, 0
which 0
leads 0
to 0
disciplinary 0
action. 0

Judging 1
by 1
past 1
“investigations” 1
conducted 1
by 1
other 1
schools 1
– 1
SFSU, 1
CUNY 1
and 1
UCI, 1
to 1
name 1
a 1
few 1
– 1
I 1
am 1
not 1
optimistic. 1
