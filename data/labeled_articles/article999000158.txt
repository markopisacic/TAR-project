about 0 8 2
his 0 8 2
previous 0 8 2
support 0 8 2
of 0 8 2
Farrakhan, 0 8 2

claims 0 8 2
that 0 8 2

Yeah, 1 8 3
right, 1 8 3
Hakim! 1 8 3

the 1 8 17

said 0 8 18
that 0 8 18
many, 0 8 18
many 0 8 18
years 0 8 18

“Look, 0 8 19
in 0 8 19
the 0 8 19
early 0 8 19
1990s, 0 8 19
Louis 0 8 19
Farrakhan 0 8 19
was 0 8 19

added. 0 8 19

"At 0 8 20
that 0 8 20
time, 0 8 20
he 0 8 20
had 0 8 20
some 0 8 20
things, 0 8 20
I 0 8 20
thought, 0 8 20
he 0 8 20
had 0 8 20

then 0 8 21
concluded, 0 8 21
"He 0 8 21
made 0 8 21
it 0 8 21
very 0 8 21
clear 0 8 21
in 0 8 21
the 0 8 21
early 0 8 21

that 0 8 21

were 1 8 21
absolutely 1 8 21

Keith, 0 8 22
you're 0 8 22
lying. 0 8 22

It's 0 8 23
clear 0 8 23
from 0 8 23
video 0 8 23
evidence 0 8 23
that 0 8 23
Ellison 0 8 23
and 0 8 23
fellow 0 8 23
Democrat 0 8 23
Gregory 0 8 23
Meeks 0 8 23

Iranian 0 8 23

President 0 8 23
Hassan 0 8 23
Rouhani 0 8 23
in 0 8 23
2013. 0 8 23

Take 0 8 24
a 0 8 24
look 0 8 24
for 0 8 24
yourself 0 8 24
and 0 8 24
understand 0 8 24
how 0 8 24
pathological 0 8 24
liar 0 8 24
and 0 8 24
accused 0 8 24
woman 0 8 24
abuser 0 8 24
Keith 0 8 24
Ellison 0 8 24
seeks 0 8 24
to 0 8 24
deceive 0 8 24
you. 0 8 24

In 0 8 25
case 0 8 25
you 0 8 25
missed 0 8 25
it, 0 8 25
here's 1 8 25
a 1 8 25
still 1 8 25
frame 1 8 25
of 1 8 25
Ellison 1 8 25
just 1 8 25
a 1 8 25
few 1 8 25
feet 1 8 25
away 1 8 25
from 1 8 25
a 1 8 25
man 1 8 25
who 1 8 25
has 1 8 25
called 1 8 25
on 1 8 25
10,000 1 8 25
blacks 1 8 25
to 1 8 25
stalk 1 8 25
and 1 8 25
murder 1 8 25
white 1 8 25
people. 1 8 25

Both 0 8 26
of 0 8 26
these 0 8 26
men 0 8 26
have 0 8 26
the 0 8 26
same 0 8 26
devil 0 8 26
as 0 8 26
their 0 8 26
father 0 8 26
because 0 8 26
both 0 8 26
men 0 8 26
are 0 8 26
following 0 8 26
after 0 8 26
the 0 8 26
teaching 0 8 26
of 0 8 26
the 0 8 26
Koran 0 8 26
. 0 8 26

One 0 8 27
of 0 8 27
them 0 8 27
just 0 8 27
actually 0 8 27
has 0 8 27
the 0 8 27
nerve 0 8 27
to 0 8 27
say 0 8 27
it. 0 8 27

The 0 8 28
other 0 8 28
doesn't. 0 8 28

Maybe 0 8 29
Ellison 0 8 29
is 0 8 29
attempting 0 8 29
to 1 8 29
pull 1 8 29
an 1 8 29
Obama. 1 8 29

Remember 0 8 30
when 0 8 30
Obama's 0 8 30
"pastor," 0 8 30
Jeremiah 0 8 30
Wright 0 8 30
uttered 0 8 30
"God 0 8 30
damn, 0 8 30
America!"? 0 8 30

Obama 0 8 31
tried 0 8 31
to 0 8 31
say 0 8 31
he 0 8 31
had 0 8 31
been 0 8 31
in 0 8 31
that 0 8 31
church 0 8 31
for 0 8 31
years 0 8 31
and 0 8 31
never 0 8 31
heard 0 8 31
such 0 8 31
things, 0 8 31
which 0 8 31
isn't 0 8 31
true. 0 8 31

Ellison 1 8 32
is 1 8 32
attempting 1 8 32
to 1 8 32
do 1 8 32
that 1 8 32
same. 1 8 32

However, 0 8 33
as 0 8 33
Michael 0 8 33
Ahrens 0 8 33
of 0 8 33
GOP.com 0 8 33

what 0 8 33
kind 0 8 33
of 0 8 33
man 0 8 33
Farrakhan 0 8 33
was 0 8 33
then 0 8 33
and 0 8 33
what 0 8 33
kind 0 8 33
of 0 8 33
man 0 8 33
he 0 8 33
still 0 8 33
is 0 8 33
today. 0 8 33

tweeted, 0 8 34
“In 0 8 34

totalitarian-minded 0 8 38
individual, 0 8 38
