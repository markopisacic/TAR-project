What's 0
amazing 0
is 0
that 0
Democrats 0
cover 0
for 0
their 0
own, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
obvious 1
hypocrisy 1
they 0
demonstrate 0
when 0
they 0
opponents 0
are 0
accused 0
of 0
such 0
things. 0

Even 0
one 0
woman 0
in 0
the 0
Loomer 0
video 0
says, 0
why 0
are 0
they 0
waiting 0
till 0
now 0
to 0
bring 0
this 0
forward? 0

Well, 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Monahan, 0
perhaps 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
asked, 0
but 0
not 0
for 0
Amy 0
Alexander. 0

That 0
report 0
was 0
filed 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
decade 0
ago. 0

It 0
appears 0
that 0
with 0
Ms. 0
Monahan's 0
claims 0
and 0
Keith 0
Ellison's 0
unwillingness 0
to 0
address 0
the 0
public 0
with 0
his 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
that 0
perhaps, 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
changed 0
his 0
ways 0
at 0
all. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
can 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
justify 0
his 0
actions 0
based 0
upon 0
the 0
demonic 1
teachings 1
of 1
Muhammad 1
in 1
the 1
Koran. 1

He 0
has 0
already 0
won 0
the 0
primary 0
to 0
be 0
Minnesota's 0
AG. 0

Will 1
the 1
people 1
not 1
demand 1
justice 1
and 1
vote 1
a 1
Communist-backed, 1
Muslim, 1
accused 1
woman 1

into 0
