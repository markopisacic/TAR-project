Progressives 0
say 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
more 0
like 0
Sweden. 0

That 0
means 0
turning 0
our 0
country 0
into 0
a 1
hopeless 1
hellhole 1
where 1
the 1
native 1
population 1
is 1
overtaxed 1
and 1
terrorized 1
by 1
warring 1
foreign 1
gangs. 1

We're 0
getting 0
there 0
too. 0

What 0
should 0
we 0
do? 0

Maybe 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
more 0
like 0
Sweden? 0

Sweden 0
will 0
do 0
whatever 0
it 0
takes, 0
including 0
sending 0
in 0
the 0
army, 0
to 0
end 0

Prime 0

in 0
Wednesday. 0

Sweden's 0
murder 0
rate 0
is 0
relatively 0
low 0
in 0
international 0
terms, 0
but 0
gang 0
violence 0
has 0
surged 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
and 0
Swedes 0
are 0
worried 0
that 0
the 0
police 0
are 0
unable 0
to 0
cope. 0

Of 1
course 1
they 1
can't 1
cope. 1

It's 0
Demolition 1
Man 1
in 0
real 0
life 0
pitting 0

who 0
are 0
used 0
to 0
telling 0

not 0

raise 0
their 0

Four 0
people 0
were 0
shot 0
dead 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
week 0
of 0
this 0

One 0

Law 0
and 0

is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
major 0
issue 0
in 0
a 0

"It 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
my 0
first 0
option 0
to 0
bring 0
in 0
the 0
military, 0
but 0
I 0
am 0

do 0
whatever 0

sure 0
that 0
serious, 0

out," 1
Lofven 0
told 0

Bringing 0
in 0
the 0
military 0
comes 0
in 0
as 0
an 0
option 0
ahead 0
of 0
cutting 0
migration 0
to 0
Sweden. 1

That 1
tells 1
you 1
everything. 1

Why 0
would 0
anyone 0
associate 0
rising 0
crime 0
and 0
immigration? 0

Maybe 0
because 0
the 0
gangs 0
in 0
question 0
are 0
immigrant 0
gangs. 0

The 0
government 0
has 0
promised 0
police 0
an 0
extra 0
7.1 0
billion 0
crowns 0
($880 0
million) 0
through 0
2020, 0
toughened 0
laws 0
on 0
gun 0
crimes 0
and 0
made 0
it 0
easier 0
for 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
monitor 0
private 0
phone 0
calls 0
and 0
emails, 0
among 0
other 0
measures. 0

Sound 0
familiar? 0

Mass 1
repression 1
and 1
police 1
powers 1
that 1
don't 1
actually 1
address 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
problem. 1

Meanwhile 0
the 0
Grenade 0
Amnesty 0
doesn't 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
worked. 0

And 0
the 0
gang 0
violence 0
keeps 0
rising. 0

But 0
who 0
are 0
these 0
gangs? 0

The 0
criminal 0
gang 0
Loyal 0
to 0
Familia 0
has 0
already 0
spread 0
across 0
Denmark 0
from 0
its 0
base 0
in 0
the 0
Nørrebro 0
district 0
of 0
Copenhagen 0
and 0
now 0
it 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
set 0
its 0
sights 0
on 0
Sweden. 0

Swedish 0
police 0
told 0
the 0
Danish 0
tabloid 0
Ekstra 0
Bladet 0
that 0
the 0
gang 0
is 0
trying 0
to 0
build 0
a 0
presence 0
in 0
both 0
Malmö 0
and 0
Helsingborg. 0

An 0
expansion 0
into 0
Malmö 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
recipe 0
for 0
increased 0
violence 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
gun 0
violence 0
claimed 0
the 0
lives 0
of 0
11 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
southern 0
Swedish 0
city 0
last 0
year. 0

The 0
gang's 0
leader, 0
Shuaib 0
Khan, 0
confirmed 0
that 0
the 0
group 0
is 0
eyeing 0
the 0
two 0
Swedish 0
cities 0
but 0
denied 0
that 0
Loyal 0
to 0
Familia 0
was 0
a 0
“criminal 0
gang”. 0

Just 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
Danish 0
gangs 0
led 0
by 0
a 0

Khan. 0
