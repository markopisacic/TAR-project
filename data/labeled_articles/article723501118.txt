We 0 115 0
Should 0 115 0
Be 0 115 0
More 0 115 0
Like 0 115 0
Sweden: 0 115 0

Use 0 115 0
Army 0 115 0
Against 0 115 0
Immigrant 0 115 0
Gangs 0 115 0

Progressives 0 115 1
say 0 115 1
we 0 115 1
should 0 115 1
be 0 115 1
more 0 115 1
like 0 115 1
Sweden. 0 115 1

That 0 115 2
means 0 115 2
turning 0 115 2
our 0 115 2
country 0 115 2
into 0 115 2
a 1 115 2
hopeless 1 115 2
hellhole 1 115 2
where 1 115 2
the 1 115 2
native 1 115 2
population 1 115 2
is 1 115 2
overtaxed 1 115 2
and 1 115 2
terrorized 1 115 2
by 1 115 2
warring 1 115 2
foreign 1 115 2
gangs. 1 115 2

We're 0 115 3
getting 0 115 3
there 0 115 3
too. 0 115 3

What 0 115 4
should 0 115 4
we 0 115 4
do? 0 115 4

Maybe 0 115 5
we 0 115 5
should 0 115 5
be 0 115 5
more 0 115 5
like 0 115 5
Sweden? 0 115 5

Sweden 0 115 6
will 0 115 6
do 0 115 6
whatever 0 115 6
it 0 115 6
takes, 0 115 6
including 0 115 6
sending 0 115 6
in 0 115 6
the 0 115 6
army, 0 115 6
to 0 115 6
end 0 115 6
a 0 115 6
wave 0 115 6
of 0 115 6
gang 0 115 6
violence 0 115 6
that 0 115 6
has 0 115 6
seen 0 115 6
a 0 115 6
string 0 115 6

Wednesday. 0 115 6

Sweden's 0 115 7
murder 0 115 7

is 0 115 7
relatively 0 115 7
low 0 115 7
in 0 115 7
international 0 115 7
terms, 0 115 7
but 0 115 7
gang 0 115 7
violence 0 115 7
has 0 115 7
surged 0 115 7
in 0 115 7
recent 0 115 7
years 0 115 7
and 0 115 7
Swedes 0 115 7
are 0 115 7
worried 0 115 7
that 0 115 7
the 0 115 7
police 0 115 7
are 0 115 7
unable 0 115 7
to 0 115 7
cope. 0 115 7

Of 1 115 8
course 1 115 8
they 1 115 8
can't 1 115 8
cope. 1 115 8

It's 0 115 9
Demolition 1 115 9
Man 1 115 9

Four 0 115 10

One 0 115 11

"It 0 115 13

Bringing 0 115 14
in 0 115 14
the 0 115 14
military 0 115 14
comes 0 115 14
in 0 115 14
as 0 115 14
an 0 115 14
option 0 115 14
ahead 0 115 14
of 0 115 14
cutting 0 115 14
migration 0 115 14

Sweden. 1 115 14

That 1 115 15
tells 1 115 15
you 1 115 15
everything. 1 115 15

Why 0 115 16
would 0 115 16
anyone 0 115 16
associate 0 115 16
rising 0 115 16
crime 0 115 16
and 0 115 16
immigration? 0 115 16

Maybe 0 115 17
because 0 115 17
the 0 115 17
gangs 0 115 17
in 0 115 17
question 0 115 17
are 0 115 17
immigrant 0 115 17
gangs. 0 115 17

The 0 115 18
government 0 115 18
has 0 115 18
promised 0 115 18
police 0 115 18
an 0 115 18
extra 0 115 18

2020, 0 115 18
toughened 0 115 18
laws 0 115 18
on 0 115 18
gun 0 115 18
crimes 0 115 18
and 0 115 18
made 0 115 18
it 0 115 18
easier 0 115 18
for 0 115 18
the 0 115 18
police 0 115 18
to 0 115 18
monitor 0 115 18
private 0 115 18

and 0 115 18
emails, 0 115 18
among 0 115 18
other 0 115 18
measures. 0 115 18

Sound 0 115 19
familiar? 0 115 19

Mass 1 115 20
repression 1 115 20
and 1 115 20
police 1 115 20
powers 1 115 20
that 1 115 20
don't 1 115 20
actually 1 115 20
address 1 115 20
the 1 115 20
cause 1 115 20
of 1 115 20
the 1 115 20
problem. 1 115 20

Meanwhile 0 115 21
the 0 115 21
Grenade 0 115 21
Amnesty 0 115 21
doesn't 0 115 21
seem 0 115 21
to 0 115 21

worked. 0 115 21

And 0 115 22
the 0 115 22
gang 0 115 22
violence 0 115 22
keeps 0 115 22
rising. 0 115 22

But 0 115 23
who 0 115 23
are 0 115 23
these 0 115 23
gangs? 0 115 23

The 0 115 24
criminal 0 115 24
gang 0 115 24
Loyal 0 115 24

it 0 115 24

to 0 115 24
have 0 115 24
set 0 115 24
its 0 115 24
sights 0 115 24
on 0 115 24
Sweden. 0 115 24

Swedish 0 115 25
police 0 115 25
told 0 115 25
the 0 115 25
Danish 0 115 25
tabloid 0 115 25
Ekstra 0 115 25
Bladet 0 115 25
that 0 115 25
the 0 115 25

in 0 115 25
both 0 115 25
Malmö 0 115 25

Helsingborg. 0 115 25

An 0 115 26
expansion 0 115 26
into 0 115 26
Malmö 0 115 26
could 0 115 26
be 0 115 26
a 0 115 26
recipe 0 115 26
for 0 115 26
increased 0 115 26

Shuaib 0 115 27
Khan, 0 115 27
confirmed 0 115 27
that 0 115 27

the 0 115 27
