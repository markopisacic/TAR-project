over 0 86 3

An 0 86 4
unprovable 0 86 4

from 0 86 4

that 0 86 4

The 0 86 13
allegations 0 86 13
against 0 86 13
Brett 0 86 13
Kavanaugh 0 86 13
— 0 86 13
outlined 0 86 13

on 0 86 13

are 0 86 13
substantial 0 86 13
and 0 86 13
serious. 0 86 13

She 0 86 14
claims 0 86 14
that 0 86 14
Kavanaugh 0 86 14
knocked 0 86 14
her 0 86 14
down, 0 86 14
groped 0 86 14
her, 0 86 14
and 0 86 14
attempted 0 86 14
to 0 86 14
remove 0 86 14
her 0 86 14
clothes. 0 86 14

Here’s 0 86 15
the 0 86 15
core 0 86 15
of 0 86 15
her 0 86 15
story: 0 86 15

While 0 86 16
his 0 86 16
friend 0 86 16
watched, 0 86 16
she 0 86 16
said, 0 86 16
Kavanaugh 0 86 16
pinned 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
to 0 86 16
a 0 86 16
bed 0 86 16
on 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
back 0 86 16
and 0 86 16
groped 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
over 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
clothes, 0 86 16
grinding 0 86 16
his 0 86 16
body 0 86 16
against 0 86 16
hers 0 86 16
and 0 86 16
clumsily 0 86 16
attempting 0 86 16
to 0 86 16
pull 0 86 16
off 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
one-piece 0 86 16
bathing 0 86 16
suit 0 86 16
and 0 86 16
the 0 86 16
clothing 0 86 16
she 0 86 16
wore 0 86 16
over 0 86 16
it. 0 86 16

When 0 86 17
she 0 86 17
tried 0 86 17
to 0 86 17
scream, 0 86 17
she 0 86 17
said, 0 86 17
he 0 86 17
put 0 86 17
his 0 86 17
hand 0 86 17
over 0 86 17
her 0 86 17
mouth. 0 86 17

“I 0 86 18
thought 0 86 18
he 0 86 18
might 0 86 18
inadvertently 0 86 18
kill 0 86 18
me,” 0 86 18
said 0 86 18
Ford, 0 86 18
now 0 86 18
a 0 86 18
51-year-old 0 86 18
research 0 86 18
psychologist 0 86 18
in 0 86 18
northern 0 86 18
California. 0 86 18

“He 0 86 19
was 0 86 19
trying 0 86 19
to 0 86 19
attack 0 86 19
me 0 86 19
and 0 86 19
remove 0 86 19
my 0 86 19
clothing.” 0 86 19
Ford 0 86 19
said 0 86 19
she 0 86 19
was 0 86 19
able 0 86 19
to 0 86 19
escape 0 86 19
when 0 86 19
Kavanaugh’s 0 86 19
friend 0 86 19
and 0 86 19
classmate 0 86 19
at 0 86 19
Georgetown 0 86 19
Preparatory 0 86 19
School, 0 86 19
Mark 0 86 19
Judge, 0 86 19
jumped 0 86 19
on 0 86 19
top 0 86 19
of 0 86 19
them, 0 86 19
sending 0 86 19
all 0 86 19
three 0 86 19
tumbling. 0 86 19

She 0 86 20
said 0 86 20
she 0 86 20
ran 0 86 20
from 0 86 20
the 0 86 20
room, 0 86 20
briefly 0 86 20
locked 0 86 20
herself 0 86 20
in 0 86 20
a 0 86 20
bathroom 0 86 20
and 0 86 20
then 0 86 20
fled 0 86 20
the 0 86 20
house. 0 86 20

Do 0 86 21
not 0 86 21
count 0 86 21
me 0 86 21
among 0 86 21
those 0 86 21
who 0 86 21
would 0 86 21
minimize 0 86 21
this 0 86 21
alleged 0 86 21
assault. 0 86 21

I 0 86 22
went 0 86 22
to 0 86 22
a 0 86 22
high 0 86 22
school 0 86 22
that 0 86 22
had 0 86 22
more 0 86 22
than 0 86 22
its 0 86 22
share 0 86 22
of 0 86 22
drunken 0 86 22
parties, 0 86 22
and 0 86 22
my 0 86 22
classmates 0 86 22
could 0 86 22
do 0 86 22
crazy 0 86 22
and 0 86 22
stupid 0 86 22
things, 0 86 22
but 0 86 22
an 0 86 22
act 0 86 22
like 0 86 22
this 0 86 22
was 0 86 22
beyond 0 86 22
the 0 86 22
pale. 0 86 22

This 0 86 23
isn’t 0 86 23
“boys 1 86 23
will 1 86 23
be 1 86 23
boys.” 1 86 23
Actions 0 86 23
have 0 86 23
consequences, 0 86 23
and 0 86 23
it’s 0 86 23
hardly 0 86 23
unjust 0 86 23
to 0 86 23
tell 0 86 23
a 0 86 23
person 0 86 23
that 0 86 23
if 0 86 23
he 0 86 23
mistreated 0 86 23
another 0 86 23
human 0 86 23
being 0 86 23
like 0 86 23
this 0 86 23
— 0 86 23
even 0 86 23
a 0 86 23
long 0 86 23
time 0 86 23
ago 0 86 23
— 0 86 23
he 0 86 23
has 0 86 23
to 0 86 23
remain 0 86 23
“merely” 0 86 23
a 0 86 23
judge 0 86 23
on 0 86 23
the 0 86 23
D.C. 0 86 23

Circuit 0 86 24
Court 0 86 24
of 0 86 24
Appeals. 0 86 24

Since 0 86 25
Kavanaugh 0 86 25
has 0 86 25
denied 0 86 25
the 0 86 25
story, 0 86 25
however, 0 86 25
the 0 86 25
question 0 86 25
of 0 86 25
whether 0 86 25
the 0 86 25
event 0 86 25
is 0 86 25
so 0 86 25
egregious 0 86 25
that 0 86 25
it 0 86 25
should 0 86 25
disqualify 0 86 25
him 0 86 25
is 0 86 25
moot. 0 86 25

At 0 86 26
the 0 86 26
very 0 86 26
least, 0 86 26
if 0 86 26
the 0 86 26
attack 0 86 26
happened, 0 86 26
he 0 86 26
should 0 86 26
be 0 86 26
disqualified 0 86 26
for 0 86 26
lying. 0 86 26

Yet 0 86 27
unless 0 86 27
all 0 86 27
parties 0 86 27
start 0 86 27
telling 0 86 27
the 0 86 27
same 0 86 27
story, 0 86 27
there 0 86 27
is 0 86 27
no 0 86 27
way 0 86 27
to 0 86 27
know 0 86 27
for 0 86 27
certain 0 86 27
if 0 86 27
this 0 86 27
event 0 86 27
occurred. 0 86 27

We 0 86 28
don’t 0 86 28
need 0 86 28
certainty, 0 86 28
however, 0 86 28
to 0 86 28
make 0 86 28
a 0 86 28
decision 0 86 28
on 0 86 28
whether 0 86 28
a 0 86 28
man 0 86 28
should 0 86 28
sit 0 86 28
on 0 86 28
the 0 86 28
Supreme 0 86 28
Court. 0 86 28

I 0 86 29
have 0 86 29
the 0 86 29
same 0 86 29
standard 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Brett 0 86 29
Kavanaugh 0 86 29
as 0 86 29
I 0 86 29
did 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Roy 0 86 29
Moore, 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Donald 0 86 29
Trump, 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Bill 0 86 29
Clinton 0 86 29
— 0 86 29
or 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
any 0 86 29
other 0 86 29
politician 0 86 29
who’s 0 86 29
accused 0 86 29
of 0 86 29
misconduct. 0 86 29

Is 0 86 30
it 0 86 30
more 0 86 30
likely 0 86 30
than 0 86 30
not 0 86 30
that 0 86 30
the 0 86 30
allegation 0 86 30
is 0 86 30
true? 0 86 30

Given 0 86 31
the 0 86 31
totality 0 86 31
of 0 86 31
the 0 86 31
evidence, 0 86 31
I 0 86 31
believe 0 86 31
it 0 86 31
is 0 86 31
more 0 86 31
likely 0 86 31
than 0 86 31
not 0 86 31
that 0 86 31
Bill 0 86 31
Clinton 0 86 31
committed 0 86 31
rape 0 86 31
and 0 86 31
sexual 0 86 31
harassment. 0 86 31

I 0 86 32
believe 0 86 32
it 0 86 32
is 0 86 32
more 0 86 32
likely 0 86 32
than 0 86 32
not 0 86 32
that 0 86 32
Donald 0 86 32
Trump 0 86 32
has 0 86 32
committed 0 86 32
sexual 0 86 32
assault. 0 86 32

I 0 86 33
believe 0 86 33
it 0 86 33
is 0 86 33
more 0 86 33
likely 0 86 33
than 0 86 33
not 0 86 33
that 0 86 33
Roy 0 86 33
Moore 0 86 33
engaged 0 86 33
in 0 86 33
sexual 0 86 33
misconduct 0 86 33
with 0 86 33
underage 0 86 33
girls. 0 86 33

But 0 86 34
the 0 86 34
evidence 0 86 34
against 0 86 34
Kavanaugh 0 86 34
falls 0 86 34
far 0 86 34
short 0 86 34
of 0 86 34
the 0 86 34
evidence 0 86 34
arrayed 0 86 34
against 0 86 34
each 0 86 34
of 0 86 34
these 0 86 34
men. 0 86 34

So 0 86 35
far 0 86 35
at 0 86 35
least 0 86 35
it 1 86 35
falls 1 86 35
far 1 86 35
short 1 86 35
of 1 86 35
the 1 86 35
evidence 1 86 35
against 1 86 35
virtually 1 86 35
any 1 86 35
other 1 86 35
politician 1 86 35
or 1 86 35
celebrity 1 86 35
who 1 86 35
has 1 86 35
faced 1 86 35
consequences 1 86 35
during 0 86 35
this 0 86 35
#MeToo 0 86 35
moment. 0 86 35

Here’s 0 86 36
why: 0 86 36

First, 0 86 37
one 0 86 37
way 0 86 37
to 0 86 37
help 0 86 37
test 0 86 37
the 0 86 37
veracity 0 86 37
of 0 86 37
old 0 86 37
claims 0 86 37
is 0 86 37
to 0 86 37
ask 0 86 37
whether 0 86 37
there 0 86 37
is 0 86 37
any 0 86 37
contemporaneous 0 86 37
corroboration. 0 86 37

Did 0 86 38
the 0 86 38
accuser 0 86 38
tell 0 86 38
a 0 86 38
friend 0 86 38
or 0 86 38
family 0 86 38
member 0 86 38
or 0 86 38
anyone 0 86 38
about 0 86 38
the 0 86 38
alleged 0 86 38
assault 0 86 38
when 0 86 38
it 0 86 38
occurred? 0 86 38

With 0 86 39
Clinton, 0 86 39
Trump, 0 86 39
Moore, 0 86 39
and 0 86 39
many 0 86 39
other 0 86 39
politicians 0 86 39
and 0 86 39
celebrities, 0 86 39
there 0 86 39
was 0 86 39
ample 0 86 39
contemporaneous 0 86 39
corroboration. 0 86 39

Here, 0 86 40
there 0 86 40
was 0 86 40
not. 0 86 40

According 0 86 41
to 0 86 41
the 0 86 41
Washington 0 86 41
Post, 0 86 41
“Ford 0 86 41
said 0 86 41
she 0 86 41
told 0 86 41

of 0 86 41
the 0 86 41

until 0 86 41
2012, 0 86 41
when 0 86 41
she 0 86 41
was 0 86 41
in 0 86 41
couples 0 86 41
therapy 0 86 41
with 0 86 41
her 0 86 41
husband.” 0 86 41

That’s 0 86 42
almost 0 86 42
three 0 86 42
decades 0 86 42
of 0 86 42
silence 0 86 42
— 0 86 42
three 0 86 42
decades 0 86 42
when 0 86 42
memories 0 86 42
can 0 86 42
grow 0 86 42
cloudy 0 86 42
and 0 86 42
recollections 0 86 42
can 0 86 42
change. 0 86 42

But 0 86 43
even 0 86 43
the 0 86 43
allegedly 0 86 43
corroborating 0 86 43
notes 0 86 43
of 0 86 43
the 0 86 43
therapist 0 86 43
raise 0 86 43
a 0 86 43
separate 0 86 43
problem. 0 86 43

They 0 86 44
actually 0 86 44
contradict 0 86 44
her 0 86 44
story 0 86 44
on 0 86 44
a 0 86 44
key 0 86 44
detail. 0 86 44

According 0 86 45
to 0 86 45
the 0 86 45
Post, 0 86 45
“The 0 86 45
notes 0 86 45
say 0 86 45
four 0 86 45
boys 0 86 45
were 0 86 45
involved, 0 86 45
a 0 86 45
discrepancy 0 86 45
that 0 86 45
Ford 0 86 45
says 0 86 45
was 0 86 45
an 0 86 45
error 0 86 45
on 0 86 45
the 0 86 45
therapist’s 0 86 45
part. 0 86 45

Ford 0 86 46
said 0 86 46
there 0 86 46
were 0 86 46
four 0 86 46
boys 0 86 46
at 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
party 0 86 46
but 0 86 46
only 0 86 46
two 0 86 46
in 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
room.” 0 86 46
Nor 0 86 46
do 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
notes 0 86 46
mention 0 86 46
Kavanaugh’s 0 86 46
name, 0 86 46
even 0 86 46
though 0 86 46
her 0 86 46
husband 0 86 46
says 0 86 46
Ford 0 86 46
named 0 86 46
Kavanaugh 0 86 46
in 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
sessions. 0 86 46

Those 0 86 47
are 0 86 47
important 0 86 47
discrepancies, 0 86 47
and 1 86 47
if 1 86 47
six 1 86 47
years 1 86 47
ago 1 86 47
she 1 86 47
told 1 86 47
the 1 86 47
therapist 1 86 47
four 1 86 47
men 1 86 47
and 1 86 47
says 1 86 47
two 1 86 47
men 1 86 47
now, 1 86 47
that 1 86 47
suggests 1 86 47
that 1 86 47
her 1 86 47
memory 1 86 47
of 1 86 47
the 1 86 47
event 1 86 47
may 1 86 47
be 1 86 47
suspect. 1 86 47

As 0 86 48
a 0 86 48
former 0 86 48
trial 0 86 48
lawyer, 0 86 48
I 1 86 48
can 1 86 48
tell 1 86 48
you 1 86 48
that 1 86 48
while 1 86 48
neither 1 86 48
notes 1 86 48
nor 1 86 48
memories 1 86 48
are 1 86 48
infallible, 1 86 48
in 1 86 48
a 1 86 48
contest 1 86 48
between 1 86 48
contemporaneous 1 86 48
notes 1 86 48
and 1 86 48
later 1 86 48
verbal 1 86 48
testimony 1 86 48
about 1 86 48
those 1 86 48
notes, 1 86 48
the 1 86 48
content 1 86 48
of 1 86 48
the 1 86 48
written 1 86 48
notes 1 86 48
usually 1 86 48
prevails. 1 86 48

Juries 0 86 49
are 0 86 49
extremely 1 86 49
skeptical 1 86 49
of 0 86 49
witnesses 0 86 49
who 0 86 49
contradict 0 86 49
written 0 86 49
notes 0 86 49
— 0 86 49
after 0 86 49
all, 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
notes 0 86 49
are 0 86 49
taken 0 86 49
when 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
words 0 86 49
are 0 86 49
immediate 0 86 49
and 0 86 49
there 0 86 49
isn’t 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
overwhelming 0 86 49
pressure 0 86 49
of 0 86 49
a 0 86 49
trial 0 86 49
to 0 86 49
conform 0 86 49
your 0 86 49
testimony 0 86 49
to 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
desired 0 86 49
outcome. 0 86 49

At 0 86 50
least 0 86 50
the 0 86 50
investigation 0 86 50
seems 0 86 50
somewhat 0 86 50
manageable. 0 86 50

If 0 86 51
there 0 86 51
were 0 86 51
only 0 86 51
four 0 86 51
boys 0 86 51
there, 0 86 51
who 0 86 51
were 0 86 51
the 0 86 51
other 0 86 51
two? 0 86 51

Let’s 0 86 52
hear 0 86 52
from 0 86 52
them. 0 86 52

In 0 86 53
fact, 0 86 53
investigators 0 86 53
should 0 86 53
interview 0 86 53
everyone 0 86 53
else 0 86 53
at 0 86 53
the 0 86 53
party. 0 86 53

Yet 0 86 54
given 0 86 54
all 0 86 54
the 0 86 54
years 0 86 54
that 0 86 54
have 0 86 54
passed, 0 86 54
would 0 86 54
it 0 86 54
be 0 86 54
possible 0 86 54
to 0 86 54
find 0 86 54
anyone 0 86 54
who 0 86 54
remembers 0 86 54
being 0 86 54
at 0 86 54
that 0 86 54
party? 0 86 54

Would 0 86 55
they 0 86 55
remember 0 86 55
any 0 86 55
details 0 86 55
at 0 86 55
all? 0 86 55

If 0 86 56
someone 0 86 56
saw 0 86 56
Kavanaugh 0 86 56
stumbling 1 86 56
drunk 1 86 56
at 0 86 56
the 0 86 56
party, 0 86 56
that 0 86 56
would 0 86 56
obviously 0 86 56
bolster 0 86 56
Ford’s 0 86 56
account. 0 86 56

If 0 86 57
another 0 86 57
attendee 0 86 57
says, 0 86 57
“He 0 86 57
was 0 86 57
totally 0 86 57
sober 0 86 57
and 0 86 57
with 0 86 57
me 0 86 57
the 0 86 57
whole 0 86 57
time,” 0 86 57
that 0 86 57
helps 0 86 57
Kavanaugh. 0 86 57

But 0 86 58
the 0 86 58
odds 0 86 58
of 0 86 58
getting 0 86 58
details 0 86 58
that 0 86 58
precise 0 86 58
are 0 86 58
long 0 86 58
indeed, 0 86 58
and 0 86 58
there 0 86 58
is 0 86 58
always 0 86 58
a 0 86 58
chance 0 86 58
that 0 86 58
a 0 86 58
motivated 0 86 58
classmate 0 86 58
might 0 86 58
lie 0 86 58
— 0 86 58
for 0 86 58
either 0 86 58
person…. 0 86 58
