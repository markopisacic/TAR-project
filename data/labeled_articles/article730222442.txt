This 0

The 0
icy 0
cigar 0
was 0
probably 0
knocked 0
askew 0
by 0
a 0
violent 0
collision 0
with 0
another 0
object. 0

The 0
researchers 0
don’t 0
know 0
exactly 0
when 0
this 0
happened, 0
but 0
suspect 0
it 0
took 0
place 0
before 0
'Oumuamua 0
left 0
its 0
home 0
stellar 0
system. 0

"It's 0
hard 0
to 0
know 0
if 0
it 0
was 0
during 0
planet 0
formation 0
or 0
after 0
the 0
planet 0
formation 0
process," 0
Fraser 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
show. 0

"Certainly, 0
more 0
collisions 0
happen 0
while 0
planets 0
are 0
growing 0
than 0
afterwards, 0
so 0
that’s 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
guess. 0

But 0
unfortunately 0
we 0
can’t 0
get 0
a 0
high-resolution 0
image 0
of 0
this 0
thing 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
kind 0
of 0
crater 0
is 0
on 0
it 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
attributed 0
to 0
the 0
collision 0
that 0
caused 0
it 0
to 0
start 0
tumbling." 0

The 0
team 0
think 0
'Oumuamua 0
may 0
eventually 0
move 0
less 0
chaotically. 0

"The 0
tumbling 0
actually 0
causes 0
stresses 0
and 0
strains 0
internal 0
to 0
the 0
object, 0
and 0
that 0
slowly 0
but 0
surely 0
squeezes 0
and 0
pulls 0
on 0
the 0
object 0
just 0
like 0
tides 0
on 0
the 0
Earth 0
to 0
remove 0
energy 0
from 0
the 0
spin," 0
Fraser 0
said. 0

But, 0
at 0
least 0
for 0
the 0
next 0
few 0
billion 0
years, 0
the 0
space 0
invader 0
is 0
destined 0
to 0
continue 0
its 1
topsy-turvy 1
spin. 1
