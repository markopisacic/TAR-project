SPECIAL 0
REPORT: 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
Accused 0
of 0
Inaction 0
in 0
Notorious 0
Sex 0
Abuse 0
Cases 0

The 0
incident 0
was 0
brief: 0
on 0
the 0
Thursday 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
week-long 0
South 0
American 0
trip, 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
an 0
impromptu 0
question 0
tossed 1
out 1
by 0
a 0
Chilean 0
reporter, 0
the 0
pope 0
responded 0
in 0
what 0
one 0
reporter 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“snippy 1
tone”: 1
“The 0
day 0
I 0
see 0
proof 0
against 0
Bishop 0
Barros, 0
then 0
I 0
will 0
talk. 0

There 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
single 0
piece 0
of 0
evidence 0
against 0
him. 0

It 0
is 0
all 0
calumny. 0

Is 0
that 0
clear?” 0

This 0
month 0
has 0
been 0
quite 0
a 0
spectacle, 0
even 0
for 0
this 0
pontificate; 0
an 0
apparently 0
unending 1
stream 1
of 1
outrages 1
and 1
embarrassments, 1
with 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
his 0
Vatican 0
media 0
support 0
jumping 0
from 0
one 0
scandal 0
to 0
the 0
next. 0

But 0
among 0
secular 0
reporters 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
issue 0
trumps 0
all 0
others 0
and 0
the 0
fallout 0
continues 0
to 1
blaze 1
down 1
on 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
pontificate 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
his 0
amazing 0
accusation 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
that 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
were 0
engaging 0
in 0
“calumny,” 0
in 0
their 0
accusations 0
against 0
a 0
Chilean 0
bishop, 0
Juan 0
de 0
la 0
Cruz 0
Barros 0
Madrid. 0

It 0
seems 0
the 0
shine 0
is 0
coming 0
off 0
the 0
papal 0
penny 0
among 0
leftist 1
secular 1
journalists, 1
his 0
natural 0
constituency. 0

Writing 0
for 0
the 0
Boston 0
Globe, 0
the 0
paper 0
that 0
first 0
broke 0
the 0
clerical 0
sex 0
abuse 0
scandals 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
back 0
in 0
2001, 0
Kevin 0
Cullen 0
wrote, 0
“Let 0
the 0
record 0
show 0
that 0
the 0

Pope 0

died 0
in 0
Santiago, 0
Chile, 0
on 0
Jan. 0
18, 0

the 0

our 0
Lord 0
2018… 0
he 0

himself 0
like 0
no 0
one 0
else 0
could.” 0

But 0
it 0
gets 0
worse 0
than 0
this. 0

When 0
a 1
“leftist” 1
pope 1
pressing 0
a 0
secularist 0
agenda 0
on 0
the 0
Church 0
starts 0
to 0
lose 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
Michael 0
Sean 0
Winters 0
and 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter, 0
he 0
must 0
know 0
he’s 0
in 0
trouble. 0

Though 0
he’s 0
“sticking 0
with 0
Francis” 0
for 0
now, 0
Winters 0
wrote, 0
“I 0
wish 0
I 0
knew 0
what 0
it 0
was 0
about 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
that 0
makes 0
him 0
fail 0
to 0
grasp 0
the 0
situation 0
with 0
Bishop 0
Barros, 0
the 0
pain 0
caused 0
to 0
the 0
victims 0
and 0
the 0
damage 0
done 0
to 0
the 0
church. 0

I 0
am 0
gobsmacked 1
that 0
the 0
pope 0
twice 0
declined 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
bishop’s 0
resignation.” 0

On 0
January 0
23rd, 0
an 0
unsigned 0
NCR 0
editorial 0
opined, 0
“Within 0
the 0
space 0
of 0
four 0
days, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
twice 0
slandered 0
abuse 0
survivors.” 0

“These 0
remarks 0
are 0
at 0
the 0
least 0
shameful. 0

At 0
the 0
most, 0
they 0
suggest 0
that 0
Francis 0
now 0
could 0
be 0
complicit 0
in 0
the 0
cover-up. 0

The 0
script 0
is 0
all 0
too 0
familiar: 0
Discredit 0
the 0
survivors’ 0
testimony, 0
support 0
the 0
prelate 0
in 0
question, 0
and 0
bank 0
on 0
public 0
attention 0
moving 0
on 0
to 0
something 0
else. 0

“The 0
insistence 0
with 0
which 0
Francis 0
defends 0
Barros 0
is 0
mystifying. 0

Three 0
separate 0
journalists 0
on 0
the 0
papal 0
flight 0
gave 0
the 0
pope 0
opportunity 0
to 0
say 0
why 0
exactly 0
he 0
believed 0
the 0
bishop 0
instead 0
of 0
the 0
survivors 0
accusing 0
him. 0

The 0
second 0
journalist 0
to 0
ask 0
Francis 0
about 0
Barros 0
on 0
the 0
flight 0
was 0
a 0
Chilean 0
woman. 0

As 0
she 0
spoke 0
to 0
the 0
pope, 0
her 1
voice 1
cracked 1
with 1
nervousness 1
at 0
questioning 0
the 0
church’s 0
top 0
leader. 0

She 0
asked: 0
‘Why 0
are 0
not 0
the 0
victims’ 0
testimonies 0
proof 0
for 0
you? 0

Why 0
do 0
you 0
not 0
believe 0
them?’ 0
The 0
pope 0
gave 0
no 0
satisfying 0
answer, 0
only 0
repeating 0
a 0
claim 0
of 0
‘no 0
evidence’ 0
against 0
the 0
bishop.” 0

Indeed, 0
it 0
was 0
understood, 0
as 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
said, 0
that 0
Francis’ 0
trip 0
to 0
Latin 0
America 0
– 0
dogged 0
by 0
protests 0
over 0
Barros 0
both 0
in 0
person 0
at 0
the 0
pope’s 0
appearances 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
– 0
was 0
in 0
part 0
intended 0
as 0
“an 0
apology 0
tour” 0
to 0
abuse 0
survivors. 0

Which 0
is 0
why 0
his 0
accusation 0
of 0
calumny 0
against 0
those 0
same 0
victims 0
the 0
next 0
day 0
came 0
as 0
such 0
a 0
shock 0
to 0
observers 0
unused 0
to 0
Bergoglio’s 0
ability 0
to 0
turn 0
on 0
a 0
dime. 0

All 0
was 0
going 0
as 0
planned. 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
January 0
17, 0
the 0
pope 0
met 0
as 0
scheduled 0
with 0
selected 0
survivors 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
priests. 0

He 0
made 0
all 0
the 0
right 0
noises, 0
talking 0
about 0
his 0
“pain 0
and 0
shame,” 0
and 0
reportedly 0
even 0
crying, 0
at 0
what 0
happened. 0

“I 0
know 0
the 0
pain 0
of 0
these 0
cases 0
of 0
child 0
abuse 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
following 0
how 0
much 0
is 0
needed 0
to 0
overcome 0
this 0
serious 1
and 1
painful 1
evil,” 1
he 0
said. 0

24 0
hours 0
later 0
he 0
was 0
calling 0
them 0
liars. 0

James 0
Hamilton, 0
49 0
and 0
now 0
a 0
doctor, 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
Barros 0
accusers. 0

He 0
told 0
the 0
BBC 0
at 0
a 0
press 0
conference, 0
“What 0
the 0
Pope 0
has 0
done 0
today 0
is 0
offensive 0
and 0
painful, 0
and 0
not 0
only 0
against 0
us, 0
but 0
against 0
everyone 0
seeking 0
to 0
end 0
the 0
abuses.” 0
The 0
lead 0
voice 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
in 0
Chile, 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
tweeting 0
to 0
one 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
leading 0
apologists, 0
Austen 0
Ivereigh, 0
said, 0
“Does 0
he 0
need 0
a 0
photo, 0
a 0
selfie, 0
as 0
proof? 0

Sorry 0
Austen, 0
we 0
didn’t 0
think 0
of 0
it 0
as 0
we 0
were 0
being 0
abused 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
watching.” 0

Although 0
the 0
issue 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
a 0
much 0
broader 0
audience 0
during 0
the 0
most 0
recent 0
papal 0
trip, 0
the 0
outcry 0
has 0
been 0
ongoing 0
since 0
his 0
appointment 0
to 0
the 0
southern 0
Chilean 0
diocese 0
of 0
Osorno 0
in 0
2015. 0

Barros 0
was 0
a 0
student 0
protégée 0
of 0
the 1
charismatic 1
homosexual/pederast 1
predator 1
Fernando 1
Karadima, 1
and 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
be 0
ordained 0
in 0
1984, 0
made 0
bishop 0
in 0
1995 0
and 0
appointed 0
as 0
bishop 0
of 0
the 0
armed 0
forces. 0

Barros 0
claimed 0
in 0
court 0
that 0
the 0
first 0
he 0
knew 0
of 0
Karadima’s 0
offenses 0
was 0
on 0
a 0
Chilean 0
television 0
programme 0
in 0
2010. 0

This 0
is 0
refuted 0
by 0
Karadima’s 0
victims 0
– 0
deemed 0
credible 0
both 0
by 0
the 0
secular 0
courts 0
and 0
the 0
Vatican 0
tribunal 0
– 0
who 0
testified 0
that 0
he 0
personally 0
witnessed 0
the 0
abuse 0
at 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
of 0
Jesus 0
church 0
in 0
Santiago. 0

Last 0
Thursday, 0
however, 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
Francis, 0
confronted 0
unexpectedly 0
in 0
public 0
over 0
the 0
Barros 0
question, 0
has 0
responded 0
testily 0
and 0
with 0
insults. 0

In 0
2015 0
the 0
Italian 0
newspaper 0
Il 0
Fatto 0
Quotidiano 0
published 0
a 0
video 0
of 0
him 0
scolding 0
two 0
women 0
who 0
spoke 0
with 0
him 0
in 0
St. 0
Peter’s 0
Piazza, 0
asking 0
that 0
he 0
reconsider 0
the 0
appointment, 0
citing 0
the 0
“suffering” 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Chile 0
over 0
the 0
issue. 0

The 0
pope 0
told 0
the 0
women, 0
“The 0
Church 0
has 0
lost 0
its 0
freedom, 0
letting 0
its 0
head 0
fill 0
with 0
politicians 0
and 0
accusing 0
a 0
bishop 0
without 0
having 0
any 0
proof, 0
after 0
twenty 0
years 0
of 0
service, 0
so 0
think 1
with 1
your 1
head.” 1
He 0
warned 0
them 0
not 0
to 0
allow 0
themselves 0
to 0
be 0
led 0
by 0
“leftists 1
who 1
have 1
set 1
up 1
this 1
thing.” 1

“The 0
only 0
charge 0
against 0
this 0
bishop 0
has 0
been 0
discredited 0
by 0
the 0
Court 0
of 0
Justice, 0
so 0
please 0
do 0
not 0
lose 0
your 0
serenity, 0
you 0
suffer, 0
but 0
because 0
you 1
are 1
foolish...I 1
am 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
judge 0
and 0
punish 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
similar 0
crimes, 0
but 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
even 0
a 0
proof.” 0

The 0
insults 0
were 0
not 0
forgotten. 0

Among 0
the 0
signs 0
held 0
by 0
protesters 0
in 0
Chile 0
last 0
week 0
were 0
those 0
reading, 0
“Ni 0
zurdos, 0
ni 0
tontos,” 0
(Neither 1
lefties 1
nor 1
stupid). 1

The 0
jab 0
certainly 0
wasn’t 0
lost 0
on 0
Francis, 0
since 0
the 0
signs 0
were 0
being 0
held 0
by 0
protesters 0
the 0
full 0
length 0
of 0
his 0
auto 0
route 0
to 0
Santiago 0
from 0
the 0
airport. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
protesters 0
told 0
the 0
BBC, 0
“He 0
doesn’t 0
even 0
know 0
us, 0
so 0
how 0
can 0
he 0
accuse 0
us 0
of 0
being 0
such 0
things? 0

He 0
thinks 0
we 0
are 0
politically 0
motivated 0
even 0
though 0
we 0
come 0
from 0
different 0
parishes 0
in 0
Osorno 0
and 0
are 0
doing 0
this 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
against 0
priests 0
being 0
allowed 0
to 0
abuse 0
children.” 0

Apparently 0
His 0
Holiness 0
was 0
informed 0
that 0
the 0
“calumny” 1
comment 1
had 0
caused 0
some 0
blow-back 0
because 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
days 0
later 0
we 0
got 0
something 0
touted 0
– 0
though 0
somewhat 0
skeptically 0
– 0
as 0
a 0
“contrite” 0
papal 0
apology. 0

This 0
also 0
followed 0
an 0
astonishing 0
public 0
rebuke 0
of 0
the 0
pope 0
by 0
Sean 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
– 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
C9 0
council 0
of 0
cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission 0
– 0
who 0
said, 0
“It 0
is 0
understandable 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
statements 0
yesterday 0
in 0
Santiago, 0
Chile 0
were 0
a 0
source 0
of 0
great 0
pain 0
for 0
survivors 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
or 0
any 0
other 0
perpetrator.” 0

“Pope 0
Francis 0
fully 0
recognizes 0
the 1
egregious 1
failures 1
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
its 0
clergy 0
who 0
abused 0
children 0
and 0
the 0
devastating 1
impact 1
those 0
crimes 0
have 0
had 0
on 0
survivors 0
and 0
their 0
loved 0
ones,” 0
O’Malley 0
said. 0

Of 0
course, 0
Francis 0
being 0
Francis 0
the 0
apology 0
was 0
banked 0
around 0
with 0
assertions 0
of 0
how 0
right 0
he 0
was. 0

“I 0
have 0
to 0
ask 0
forgiveness 0
because 0
the 0
word 0
‘proof’ 0
wounded,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“It 0
wounded 0
many 0
people 0
who 0
were 0
abused…I 0
ask 0
them 0
for 0
forgiveness 0
because 0
I 0
wounded 0
them 0
without 0
realizing 0
it, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
unintended 0
wound. 0

And 0
this 1
horrified 1
me 1
a 1
lot, 1
because 0
I 0
had 0
received 0
them.” 0

“And 0
I 0
know 0
how 0
much 0
they 0
suffer, 0
to 0
feel 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
says 0
in 0
their 0
face 0
‘bring 0
me 0
a 0
letter, 0
a 0
proof.’ 0
It’s 0
a 0
slap. 0

And 0
I 0
agree 0
that 0
my 0
expression 0
was 0
not 0
apt, 0
because 0
I 0
didn’t 0
think.” 0

He 0
doubled 0
down, 0
saying, 0
“I 0
have 0
not 0
heard 0
any 0
victim 0
of 0
Barros. 0

They 0
did 0
not 0
come, 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
themselves, 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
give 0
evidence 0
in 0
court. 0

It’s 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
air. 1

It 0
is 0
true 0
that 0
Barros 0
was 0
in 0
Karadima’s 0
group 0
of 0
young 0
people. 0

But 0
let 0
us 0
be 0
clear: 0
if 0
you 0
accuse 0
someone 0
without 0
evidence 0
with 0
pertinacity, 0
that 0
is 0
calumny.” 0

“This 0
is 0
what 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
with 0
sincerity. 0

Barros 0
will 0
remain 0
there 0
if 0
I 0
don’t 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
condemn 0
him. 0

I 0
cannot 0
condemn 0
him 0
if 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
– 0
I 0
don’t 0
say 0
proof 0
– 0
but 0
evidence. 0

And 0
there 0
are 0
many 0
ways 0
to 0
get 0
evidence. 0

Is 0
that 0
clear?” 0

This 0
“contrite” 0
papal 0
apology 0
didn’t 0
fly 0
well 0
even 0
with 0
the 0
regular 0
news 0
reporters. 0

Philip 0
Pullela, 0
a 0
reporter 0
on 0
the 0
plane 0
for 0
Reuters, 0
described 0
it 0
as 0
“an 0
extremely 0
rare 0
act 0
of 0
self-criticism,” 0
for 0
the 0
“unusually 1
contrite” 1
Bergoglio, 0
and 0
noted 0
that, 0
“While 0
the 0
pope 0
has 0
vowed 0
‘zero 0
tolerance’ 0
for 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
his 0
efforts 0
have 0
sputtered.” 0

Indeed, 0
Francis 0
claim 0
that 0
he 0
met 0
with 0
and 0
heard 0
the 0
“pain” 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
is 0
untrue 0
in 0
the 0
specific 0
case 0
in 0
hand. 0

CBS 0
News 0
reports 0
that 0
though 0
the 0
Osorno 0
group 0
had 0
tried 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
meeting 0
during 0
the 0
trip 0
they 0
were 0
refused. 0

Greg 0
Burke, 0
the 0
pope’s 0
press 0
officer, 0
confirmed 0
that 0
“no 0
papal 0
meetings 0
were 0
planned 0
with 0
the 0
Osorno 0
group, 0
which 0
had 0
formally 0
requested 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
in 0
July 0
but 0
were 0
told 0
by 0
Vatican 0
organizers 0
that 0
his 0
schedule 0
was 0
already 0
final, 0
some 0
six 0
months 0
before 0
the 0
trip.” 0

Who 0
is 0
Barros? 0

Some 0
may 0
remember 0
a 0
video 0
that 0
made 0
the 0
internet 0
rounds 0
of 0
an 0
uproar 0
in 0
a 0
Chilean 0
cathedral 0
at 0
the 0
installation 0
ceremony 0
of 0
a 0
bishop. 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
it 0
didn’t 0
draw 0
much 0
attention 0
from 0
the 0
English 0
language 0
press 0
– 0
mostly 0
at 0
that 0
time 0
distracted 0
by 0
the 0
ongoing 0
battle 0
of 0
the 0
notorious 0
Kasper 0
Proposal 0
and 0
the 0
oncoming 0
Synods. 0

But 0
despite 0
the 0
pope’s 0
claim, 0
the 0
charges 0
against 0
Barros 0
are 0
serious 0
and 0
have 0
been 0
deemed 0
credible 0
by 0
a 0
judge. 0

He 0
is 0
accused 0
of 0
having 0
covered 0
up 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
including 0
destroying 0
evidence, 0
committed 0
by 0
Karadima 0
in 0
the 0
‘80s 0
and 0
‘90s. 0

In 0
fact 0
– 0
and 0
this 0
point 0
has 0
tended 0
to 0
get 0
glossed 0
over 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
– 0
Barros 0
is 0
accused 0
by 0
the 0
victims 0
of 0
having 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
room, 0
watching 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
and 0
of 0
engaging 0
in 0
sexual 0
activity 0
with 0
Karadima. 0

This 0
is 0
not, 0
therefore, 0
merely 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
a 0
bishop 0
or 0
colleague 0
discovering 0
the 0
abuse 0
after 0
the 0
fact, 0
but 0
of 0
being 0
a 1
voyeuristic 1
participant. 1

Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
told 0
the 0
press 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
another 0
boy 0
– 0
both 0
in 0
their 0
teens 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
– 0
“would 0
lie 0
down 0
on 0
the 0
priest’s 0
[Karadima’s] 0
bed, 0
one 0
resting 0
his 0
head 0
at 0
the 0
man’s 0
shoulder, 0
another 0
sitting 0
near 0
his 0
feet. 0

The 0
priest 0
would 0
kiss 0
the 0
boys 0
and 0
grope 0
them, 0
he 0
said, 0
all 0
while 0
the 0
Rev. 0

Juan 0
Barros 0
watched.” 0
Cruz, 0
now 0
a 0
51-year-old 0
“gay” 0
journalist, 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press, 0
“Barros 0
was 0
there, 0
and 0
he 0
saw 0
it 0
all.” 0

A 0
Vatican 0
investigation 0
found 0
Karadima 0
guilty 0
in 0
2011 0
and 0
sentenced 0
him 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
seclusion 0
in 0
a 0
monastery 0
for 0
“penitence 0
and 0
prayer.” 0
Note 0
that 0
date; 0
2011 0
was 0
when 0
the 0
processes 0
for 0
investigating 0
and 0
trying 0
priest-abusers, 1
put 0
in 0
place 0
by 0
the 0
former 0
Cardinal 0
Ratzinger, 0
were 0
still 0
in 0
effect, 0
and 0
while 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
Petrine 0
throne. 0

Things 0
are 0
a 0
bit 0
different 0
now. 0

Neither 0
was 0
the 0
complaint 0
against 0
Barros 0
without 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
responsible 0
people. 0

The 0
media 0
reported 0
that 0
over 0
1,300 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
in 0
Osorno, 0
including 0
30 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
and 0
51 0
members 0
of 0
Parliament, 0
wrote 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
asking 0
him 0
to 0
rescind 0
the 0
appointment 0
– 0
none 0
of 0
which 0
received 0
any 0
response. 0

Fr. 0

Peter 0
Kleigel, 0
a 0
priest 0
of 0
Osorno, 0
told 0
Associated 0
Press, 0
“We’re 0
convinced 0
that 0
this 0
appointment 0
is 0
not 0
correct 0
because, 0
following 0
canon 0
law, 0
a 0
bishop 0
must 0
be 0
well-regarded. 0

We 0
need 0
a 0
bishop 0
who’s 0
credible.” 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
getting 0
the 0
news 0
out 0
about 0
Karadima, 0
as 0
in 0
most 0
of 0
these 0
cases, 0
was 0
the 0
bishop, 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
Cardinal 0
Francisco 0
Javier 0
Errázuriz 0
of 0
Santiago, 0
who 0
after 0
the 0
Conclave 0
of 0
2013 0
was 0
appointed 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
C9 0
inner 0
council. 0

It 0
was 0
certainly 0
never 0
a 0
secret 0
that 0
Errázuriz 0
was 0
a 0
close, 0
like-minded 0
friend 0
and 0
collaborator 0
of 0
then-Cardinal 0
Bergoglio, 0
the 1
kingpin 1
of 1
South 1
American 1
Catholicism. 1

Allegations 0
against 0
Karadima 0
– 0
that 0
went 0
back 0
to 0
1962 0
– 0
had 0
certainly 0
been 0
reported 0
to 0
Church 0
authorities 0
well 0
before 0
a 0
Chilean 0
news 0
agency 0
revealed 0
the 0
case 0
in 0
2010, 0
but 0
were 0
ignored 0
by 0
Errázuriz. 0

Even 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter 0
in 0
2014 0
pointed 0
to 0
the 0
cover 0
up 0
and 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
the 0
new 0
pope 0
and 0
the 0
accused 0
cardinals, 0

“Hamilton 0
had 0
applied 0
for 0
a 0
marriage 0
annulment, 0
after 0
telling 0
his 0
wife 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
psychosexual 0
entanglement 0
with 0
Karadima 0
that 0
began 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
17 0
in 0
El 0
Bosque. 0

His 0
wife 0
confided 0
in 0
a 0
priest, 0
who 0
told 0
Errázuriz 0
in 0
2006. 0

When 0
a 0
canon 0
lawyer 0
and 0
several 0
priests 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
cardinal 0
suggested 0
that 0
Hamilton 0
not 0
mention 0
Karadima, 0
he 0
pressed 0
on 0
with 0
his 0
request 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
force 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
punishment 0
for 0
the 0
priest 0
while 0
having 0
his 0
marriage 0
annulled. 0

Again, 0
Errázuriz 0
refused 0
to 0
take 0
action 0
against 0
Karadima.” 0

The 0
pope’s 0
claim 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
flies 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
ruling 0
of 0
the 0
civil 0
judge 0
in 0
the 0
Karadima 0
case 0
– 0
a 0
fact 0
that 0
ought 0
to 0
be 0
of 0
paramount 0
consideration 0
under 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
own 0
rules 0
for 0
determining 0
credibility 0
in 0
such 0
cases. 0

While 0
Judge 0
Jessica 0
Gonzalez 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
drop 0
criminal 0
charges 0
because 0
the 0
statute 0
of 0
limitations 0
had 0
expired, 0
she 0
affirmed 0
that 0
testimony 0
by 0
Cruz 0
and 0
other 0
victims 0
was 0
credible. 0

After 0
a 0
full 0
year 0
of 0
investigation, 0
Gonzalez 0
called 0
their 0
claims 0
“truthful 0
and 0
reliable”. 0

Victims 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
letter 0
written 0
to 0
Church 0
authorities 0
complaining 0
of 0
Karadima’s 0
abuse 0
in 0
1982 0
was 0
intercepted 0
and 0
destroyed 0
by 0
Barros, 0
who 0
was 0
serving 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
as 0
secretary 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Francisco 0
Fresno, 0
Errázuriz’s 0
successor 0
and 0
collaborator. 0

As 0
for 0
Barros’s 0
general 0
credibility 0
as 0
a 0
Catholic 0
bishop, 0
the 0
witness 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
is 0
damning. 0

In 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Bishop 0
Ivo 0
Scapolo, 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
to 0
Chile, 0
that 0
Cruz 0
gave 0
to 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
witnessed 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Barros 0
in 0
an 0
intimate 0
relationship. 0

“I 0
saw 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
kissing 0
and 0
touching 0
each 0
other. 0

The 0
groping 0
generally 0
came 0
from 0
Karadima 0
touching 0
Barros’ 0
genitals”. 0

Barros 0
has 0
never 0
denied 0
having 0
had 0
a 0
close 0
friendship 0
with 0
Karadima. 0

Hamilton 0
confirmed 0
this 0
saying, 0
“I 0
saw 0
how 0
Barros 0
watched 0
it 0
all.” 0

And 0
the 0
matter 0
didn’t 0
end 0
in 0
2010. 0

Emails 0
published 0
in 0
Chile 0
in 0
2015 0
showed 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Errázuriz 0
also 0
blocked 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz 0
from 0
the 0
new 0
child 0
protection 0
commission 0
– 0
a 0
group 0
plagued 1
by 0
such 0
scandals 0
and 0
eventually 0
ignored 1
to 1
death 1
by 0
Francis. 0

Which 0
brings 0
us 0
to 0
Francis 0
Bergoglio’s 0
own 0
record 0
in 0
this 0
area. 0

The 0
pope 0
claimed 0
“I 0
am 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
judge 0
and 0
punish 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
similar 0
crimes,” 0
but 0
this 0
claim 0
is 0
not 0
supported 0
by 0
the 0
reality. 0

Indeed, 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
Francis 0
has 0
gone 0
to 0
considerable 0
lengths 0
to 0
dismantle 0
the 0
efforts 0
of 0
his 0
predecessor 0
at 0
“safeguarding” 0
young 0
people, 0
punishing 0
abusers 0
and 0
removing 0
bishops 0
who 0
cover 0
it 0
up. 0

In 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Barros, 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
obtained 0
a 0
confidential 0
letter 0
from 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
dated 0
2015 0
that 0
“reveals 0
the 0
[Chilean] 0
bishops’ 0
concern 0
about 0
Francis 0
naming 0
a 0
Karadima 0
protégé, 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros.” 0
Just 0
days 0
before 0
the 0
pope’s 0
“calumny” 0
comment, 0
January 0
11, 0
AP 0
reported 0
that 0
Francis 0
had 0
full 0
knowledge 0
of 0
the 0
controversy 0
he 0
risked 0
in 0
appointing 0
Barros 0
to 0
Osorno. 0

“[H]is 0
ambassador 0
in 0
Chile 0
had 0
tried 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
contain 0
the 0
damage 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
case 0
made 0
headlines.” 0

The 0
letter, 0
addressed 0
to 0
the 0
executive 0
committee 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishops’ 0
conference, 0
said, 0
“Thank 0
you 0
for 0
having 0
openly 0
demonstrated 0
the 0
concern 0
that 0
you 0
have 0
about 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
Monsignor 0
Juan 0
Barros. 0

I 0
understand 0
what 0
you’re 0
telling 0
me 0
and 0
I’m 0
aware 0
that 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
the 0
church 0
in 0
Chile 0
is 0
difficult 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
trials 0
you’ve 0
had 0
to 0
undergo.” 0
The 0
letter 0
said 0
that 0
in 0
2014 0
the 0
nuncio, 0
Archbishop 0
Scapolo, 0
had 0
asked 0
Barros 0
to 0
resign 0
as 0
bishop 0
of 0
the 0
armed 0
forces 0
and 0
had 0
“encouraged 0
him 0
to 0
take 0
a 0
sabbatical 0
year 0
before 0
assuming 0
any 0
other 0
pastoral 0
responsibility 0
as 0
a 0
bishop.” 0

There 0
can 0
also 0
be 0
little 0
doubt 0
the 0
new 0
pope 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
record 0
of 0
his 0
close 0
friend 0
Cardinal 0
Errázuriz 0
in 0
ignoring 0
complaints 0
of 0
Karadima’s 0
victims 0
when 0
he 0
appointed 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
C9 0
council. 0

And 0
even 0
if 0
he 0
didn’t 0
then, 0
he 0
certainly 0
knows 0
now, 0
and 0
yet 0
Errazuriz 0
continues 0
in 0
that 0
advisory 0
role. 0

Francis 0
further 0
appointed 0
Cardinal 0
Errázuriz 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
his 0
Special 0
Envoy 0
to 0
World 0
Apostolic 0
Congress 0
Of 0
Mercy 0
III 0
meeting 0
in 0
Bogotá, 0
Colombia 0
in 0
June 0
2014. 0

Since 0
2001, 0
Cardinal 0
Ratzinger 0
and 0
later 0
as 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
installed 0
effective 0
procedural 0
reforms 0
on 0
clerical 0
sexual 0
abuse; 0
Francis 0
in 0
his 0
short 0
five 0
years 0
has 0
all 0
but 0
completely 0
dismantled 0
or 0
reversed 0
those 0
changes. 0

Among 0
the 0
earliest 0
indications 0
Catholics 0
had 0
that 0
the 0
new 0
pope 0
had 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
getting 0
to 0
the 0
bottom 0
of 0
the 0
priest-abuser 0
problem 0
was 0
his 0
appointment 0
of 0
the 1
notorious 1
homosexual, 1
Monsignor 0
Battista 0
Ricca, 0
as 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Bank 0
and 0
the 0
man 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
residence, 0
the 0
Casa 0
Santa 0
Martha. 0

It 0
is 0
often 0
forgotten 0
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
notorious 0
comment 0
“who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge” 1
was 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
on 0
a 0
plane-presser 0
about 0
Ricca, 0
and 0
was 0
followed 0
with 0
a 0
similar 0
claim 0
from 0
Francis 0
about 0
there 0
having 0
been 0
no 0
proof 0
of 0
his 0
misbehaviour. 0

As 0
the 0
pseudonymous 0
Marcantonio 0
Colonna 0
wrote 0
in 0
the 0
book, 0
“The 0
Dictator 0
Pope,” 0
“In 0
fact 0
his 0
patronage 0
of 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca 0
fits 0
the 0
pattern 0
which 0
was 0
well 0
established 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
whereby 0
he 0
surrounds 0
himself 0
with 0
morally 0
weak 0
people 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
under 1
his 1
thumb.” 1

But 0
even 0
before 0
this 0
was 0
the 1
sinister 1
appearance 1
of 0
Godfried 0
Cardinal 0
Danneels 0
on 0
the 0
loggia 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
election 0
to 0
the 0
papacy. 0

Danneels’s 0
prominence 0
in 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
pontificate 0
continues 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
most 0
prominent 0
indicator 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
deprioritising 0
of 0
clerical 0
sexual 0
abuse. 0

The 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Brussels 0
archdiocese 0
was 0
a 0
leading 0
figure 0
in 0
the 0
so-called 0
St. 0
Gallen 0
Group, 0
which 0
he 0
himself 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“mafia,” 1
who 0
had 0
worked 0
against 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
in 0
2005 0
and 0
to 0
elect 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
2013. 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
career 0
as 0
Europe’s 0
leading 0
“liberal” 0
Catholic 0
prelate, 0
Danneels 0
came 0
under 0
a 0
cloud 0
of 0
scandal 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
having 0
covered 0
for 0
a 0
protégé 0
bishop 0
who 0
admitted 0
to 0
having 0
sexually 0
abused 0
his 0
own 0
minor 0
nephew. 0

In 0
2010 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
an 0
audio 0
recording 0
determined 0
undeniably 0
that 0
Danneels 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
victim 0
to 0
keep 0
quiet 0
and 0
not 0
cause 0
trouble 0
for 0
the 0
soon-to-retire 0
Bishop 0
Roger 0
Vangheluwe 0
of 0
Bruges. 0

The 0
cardinal 0
even 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
the 0
victim 0
should 0
“ask 0
forgiveness” 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
scandal. 0

Before 0
the 0
recordings 0
were 0
released, 0
Danneels 0
had 0
also 0
denied 0
all 0
knowledge 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
or 0
cover-ups. 0

In 0
the 0
book, 0
Colonna 0
asks 0
the 0
question, 0
“What 1
happened 1
to 1
‘Zero 1
Tolerance’ 1
for 1
clerical 1
sexual 1
offenders?” 1
He 0
wrote 0
that 0
data 0
presented 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
the 0
UN 0
Human 0
Rights 0
Commission 0
in 0
January 0
2014 0
showed 0
that 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
“had 0
defrocked 0
or 0
suspended 0
more 0
than 0
800 0
priests 0
for 0
past 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
between 0
2009 0
and 0
2012,” 0
including 0
the 0
notorious 0
Fr. 0

Maciel 0
Degollado, 0
founder 0
of 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ. 0

Crucially, 0
it 0
was 0
Ratzinger 0
who 0
moved 0
the 0
competence 0
for 0
sex 0
abuse 0
cases 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
to 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
with 0
powers 0
to 0
suspend 0
and 0
punish 0
offenders. 0

His 0
reforms 0
specifically 0
included 0
bishops 0
who 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
act 0
against 0
priest-abusers. 0

A 0
senior 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
diplomatic 0
corps, 0
Archbishop 0
Miguel 0
Maury 0
Buendia, 0
confirmed 0
this, 0
saying, 0
“This 0
Pope 0
has 0
removed 0
two 0
or 0
three 0
bishops 0
per 0
month 0
throughout 0
the 0
world... 0

There 0
have 0
been 0
two 0
or 0
three 0
instances 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
said 0
no, 0
and 0
so 0
the 0
Pope 0
simply 0
removed 0
them.” 0

These 0
reforms 0
– 0
and 0
removals 0
– 0
have 0
ceased 0
entirely 0
under 0
Francis. 0

Despite 0
his 0
claims 0
that 0
he 0
punishes 0
the 0
guilty, 0
it 0
was 0
in 0
fact 0
Francis 0
who 0
reversed 0
the 0
previous, 0
Benedict-era 0
sentence 0
against 0
the 1
notorious 1
Italian 1
priest-pederast 1
Mario 0
Inzoli 0
at 0
the 0
request 0
of 0
the 0
now-equally 0
notorious 0
Cardinal 0
Coccopalmerio. 0

Inzoli 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
in 0
2012 0
by 0
an 0
ecclesiastical 0
court 0
of 0
abusing 0
boys 0
as 0
young 0
as 0
twelve 0
and 0
suspended. 0

Inzoli 0
had 0
even 0
abused 0
boys 0
in 0
the 0
confessional, 0
convincing 0
them 0
that 0
the 1
abuse 1
was 1
approved 1
by 1
God. 1

Following 0
an 0
appeal 0
by 0
Coccopalmerio, 0
Francis 0
reduced 0
the 0
priest’s 0
penalty 0
to 0
a 0
“lifetime 0
of 0
prayer,” 0
with 0
permission 0
to 0
say 0
Mass 0
privately, 0
and 0
a 0
promise 0
to 0
stay 0
away 0
from 0
children. 0

The 0
uproar 0
over 0
this 0
caused 0
the 0
Italian 0
prosecutors 0
to 0
reopen 0
the 0
case 0
against 0
the 0
priest, 0
and 0
eventually 0
Inzoli 0
went 0
to 0
prison 0
and 0
was 0
laicized. 0

As 0
for 0
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0
procedural 0
reforms, 0
rumours 0
continue 0
to 0
circulate 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
intends 0
to 0
reverse 0
them 0
as 0
well, 0
placing 0
competence 0
back 0
into 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
dicastery 0
that 0
held 0
it 0
when 0
the 0
scandals 0
broke 0
in 0
2001. 0

This 0
has 0
been 0
denied 0
by 0
Greg 0
Burke, 0
but 0
given 1
Francis’s 1
usual 1
methods, 1
it’s 1
anyone’s 1
guess 1
who 1
in 1
reality 1
is 1
actually 1
dealing 1
with 1
these 1
cases, 1
if 1
anyone. 1

A 0
tribunal 0
of 0
bishops, 0
requested 0
by 0
his 0
own 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
was 0
ignored 0
and 0
then 0
Francis 0
summarily 0
removed 0
two 0
of 0
the 0
CDF 0
staffers 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
handling 0
such 0
cases, 0
famously 0
refusing 0
to 0
give 0
any 0
reasons 0
to 0
CDF 0
prefect 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
who 0
was 0
soon 0
to 0
be 0
dismissed. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
chaos 0
and 0
lack 0
of 0
commitment 0
on 0
the 0
issue 0
has 0
come 0
under 0
harsh 1
criticism 1
from 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
now-defunct 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
a 1
loudly 1
trumpeted 1
part 1
of 0
Bergoglio’s 0
early 0
scheme 0
of 0
reform. 0

Marie 0
Collins, 0
an 0
Irish 0
abuse 0
survivor, 0
was 0
appointed 0
in 0
2014 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Pontifical 0
Commission 0
for 0
the 0
Protection 0
of 0
Minors. 0

She 0
resigned 0
in 0
2017, 0
citing 0
“Vatican 0
officials’ 0
reluctance 0
to 0
cooperate 0
with 0
its 0
work 0
to 0
protect 0
children.” 0
Collins 0
released 0
a 0
damning 0
statement, 0
indicating 0
that 0
the 0
commission 0
had 0
never 0
seriously 0
intended 0
to 0
change 0
or 0
reform 0
anything. 0

She 0
said 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
commission’s 0
recommendations 0
had 0
been 0
implemented. 0

“The 1
reluctance 1
of 1
some 1
in 1
the 1
Vatican 1
Curia 1
to 1
implement 1
recommendations 1
or 1
cooperate 1
with 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
a 1
commission 1
when 1
the 1
purpose 1
is 1
to 1
improve 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
children 1
and 1
vulnerable 1
adults 1
around 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
unacceptable,” 1
Collins 0
wrote. 0

As 0
of 0
December 0
last 0
year, 0
the 0
commission 0
has 0
been 0
allowed 0
to 0
lapse, 0
and 0
no 0
longer 0
functions, 0
though 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
definitively 0
dissolved. 0

The 0
terms 0
of 0
office 0
of 0
its 0
members 0
expired 0
December 0
17th. 0

This 0
week 0
Collins 0
tweeted 0
her 0
question 0
for 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
the 0
Chilean 0
situation: 0
“Why 0
does 0
the 0
Pope 0
not 0
believe 0
these 0
three 0
men? 0

They 0
have 0
been 0
consistent 0
over 0
years 0
in 0
what 0
they 0
say. 0

When 0
asked 0
why 0
he 0
believes 0
his 0
fellow 0
cleric 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
survivors 0
he 0
can 0
give 0
no 0
good 0
reason.” 0

Why 0
indeed. 0
