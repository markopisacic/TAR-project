The 0 46 1
incident 0 46 1
was 0 46 1
brief: 0 46 1
on 0 46 1
the 0 46 1
Thursday 0 46 1
of 0 46 1
the 0 46 1
pope’s 0 46 1
week-long 0 46 1
South 0 46 1
American 0 46 1
trip, 0 46 1
in 0 46 1
response 0 46 1
to 0 46 1
an 0 46 1
impromptu 0 46 1
question 0 46 1
tossed 1 46 1
out 1 46 1
by 0 46 1
a 0 46 1
Chilean 0 46 1
reporter, 0 46 1
the 0 46 1
pope 0 46 1
responded 0 46 1
in 0 46 1
what 0 46 1
one 0 46 1
reporter 0 46 1
described 0 46 1
as 0 46 1
a 0 46 1
“snippy 1 46 1
tone”: 1 46 1
“The 0 46 1
day 0 46 1
I 0 46 1
see 0 46 1
proof 0 46 1
against 0 46 1
Bishop 0 46 1
Barros, 0 46 1
then 0 46 1
I 0 46 1
will 0 46 1
talk. 0 46 1

There 0 46 2
is 0 46 2
not 0 46 2
a 0 46 2
single 0 46 2
piece 0 46 2
of 0 46 2
evidence 0 46 2
against 0 46 2
him. 0 46 2

It 0 46 3
is 0 46 3
all 0 46 3
calumny. 0 46 3

Is 0 46 4
that 0 46 4
clear?” 0 46 4

This 0 46 5
month 0 46 5
has 0 46 5
been 0 46 5
quite 0 46 5
a 0 46 5
spectacle, 0 46 5
even 0 46 5
for 0 46 5
this 0 46 5
pontificate; 0 46 5
an 0 46 5
apparently 0 46 5
unending 1 46 5
stream 1 46 5
of 1 46 5
outrages 1 46 5
and 1 46 5
embarrassments, 1 46 5
with 0 46 5
the 0 46 5
pope 0 46 5
and 0 46 5
his 0 46 5
Vatican 0 46 5
media 0 46 5
support 0 46 5
jumping 0 46 5
from 0 46 5
one 0 46 5
scandal 0 46 5
to 0 46 5
the 0 46 5
next. 0 46 5

But 0 46 6
among 0 46 6
secular 0 46 6
reporters 0 46 6
the 0 46 6
sex 0 46 6
abuse 0 46 6
issue 0 46 6
trumps 0 46 6
all 0 46 6
others 0 46 6
and 0 46 6
the 0 46 6
fallout 0 46 6
continues 0 46 6
to 1 46 6
blaze 1 46 6
down 1 46 6
on 0 46 6
the 0 46 6
Bergoglian 0 46 6
pontificate 0 46 6
in 0 46 6
response 0 46 6
to 0 46 6
his 0 46 6
amazing 0 46 6
accusation 0 46 6
earlier 0 46 6
this 0 46 6
month 0 46 6
that 0 46 6
victims 0 46 6
of 0 46 6
sexual 0 46 6
abuse 0 46 6
by 0 46 6
clergy 0 46 6
were 0 46 6
engaging 0 46 6
in 0 46 6
“calumny,” 0 46 6
in 0 46 6
their 0 46 6
accusations 0 46 6
against 0 46 6
a 0 46 6
Chilean 0 46 6
bishop, 0 46 6
Juan 0 46 6
de 0 46 6

Madrid. 0 46 6

It 0 46 7
seems 0 46 7
the 0 46 7
shine 0 46 7
is 0 46 7
coming 0 46 7
off 0 46 7
the 0 46 7
papal 0 46 7
penny 0 46 7
among 0 46 7
leftist 1 46 7
secular 1 46 7
journalists, 1 46 7
his 0 46 7
natural 0 46 7
constituency. 0 46 7

Writing 0 46 8
for 0 46 8
the 0 46 8
Boston 0 46 8

But 0 46 9
it 0 46 9
gets 0 46 9
worse 0 46 9
than 0 46 9
this. 0 46 9

When 0 46 10

must 0 46 10
know 0 46 10
he’s 0 46 10

Though 0 46 11
he’s 0 46 11
“sticking 0 46 11

for 0 46 11
now, 0 46 11

I 0 46 12
am 0 46 12
gobsmacked 1 46 12
that 0 46 12
the 0 46 12
pope 0 46 12
twice 0 46 12
declined 0 46 12
to 0 46 12

On 0 46 13
January 0 46 13
23rd, 0 46 13
an 0 46 13
unsigned 0 46 13
NCR 0 46 13
editorial 0 46 13
opined, 0 46 13
“Within 0 46 13
the 0 46 13
space 0 46 13
of 0 46 13
four 0 46 13
days, 0 46 13
Pope 0 46 13
Francis 0 46 13
twice 0 46 13
slandered 0 46 13
abuse 0 46 13
survivors.” 0 46 13

“These 0 46 14
remarks 0 46 14
are 0 46 14
at 0 46 14
the 0 46 14
least 0 46 14
shameful. 0 46 14

At 0 46 15
the 0 46 15
most, 0 46 15
they 0 46 15
suggest 0 46 15
that 0 46 15
Francis 0 46 15
now 0 46 15
could 0 46 15
be 0 46 15
complicit 0 46 15
in 0 46 15
the 0 46 15
cover-up. 0 46 15

The 0 46 16
script 0 46 16
is 0 46 16
all 0 46 16
too 0 46 16
familiar: 0 46 16
Discredit 0 46 16
the 0 46 16
survivors’ 0 46 16
testimony, 0 46 16
support 0 46 16

prelate 0 46 16
in 0 46 16
question, 0 46 16
and 0 46 16
bank 0 46 16
on 0 46 16
public 0 46 16
attention 0 46 16
moving 0 46 16
on 0 46 16
to 0 46 16
something 0 46 16
else. 0 46 16

“The 0 46 17
insistence 0 46 17
with 0 46 17
which 0 46 17
Francis 0 46 17
defends 0 46 17
Barros 0 46 17
is 0 46 17
mystifying. 0 46 17

Three 0 46 18
separate 0 46 18
journalists 0 46 18
on 0 46 18
the 0 46 18
papal 0 46 18
flight 0 46 18
gave 0 46 18
the 0 46 18
pope 0 46 18
opportunity 0 46 18
to 0 46 18
say 0 46 18
why 0 46 18
exactly 0 46 18
he 0 46 18
believed 0 46 18
the 0 46 18
bishop 0 46 18
instead 0 46 18
of 0 46 18
the 0 46 18
survivors 0 46 18
accusing 0 46 18
him. 0 46 18

The 0 46 19
second 0 46 19
journalist 0 46 19
to 0 46 19
ask 0 46 19
Francis 0 46 19
about 0 46 19
Barros 0 46 19
on 0 46 19
the 0 46 19
flight 0 46 19
was 0 46 19
a 0 46 19
Chilean 0 46 19
woman. 0 46 19

As 0 46 20
she 0 46 20
spoke 0 46 20
to 0 46 20
the 0 46 20
pope, 0 46 20
her 1 46 20
voice 1 46 20
cracked 1 46 20
with 1 46 20
nervousness 1 46 20
at 0 46 20
questioning 0 46 20
the 0 46 20
church’s 0 46 20
top 0 46 20
leader. 0 46 20

She 0 46 21
asked: 0 46 21
‘Why 0 46 21
are 0 46 21
not 0 46 21
the 0 46 21
victims’ 0 46 21
testimonies 0 46 21
proof 0 46 21
for 0 46 21
you? 0 46 21

Why 0 46 22
do 0 46 22
you 0 46 22
not 0 46 22
believe 0 46 22
them?’ 0 46 22
The 0 46 22
pope 0 46 22
gave 0 46 22
no 0 46 22
satisfying 0 46 22
answer, 0 46 22
only 0 46 22
repeating 0 46 22
a 0 46 22
claim 0 46 22
of 0 46 22
‘no 0 46 22
evidence’ 0 46 22
against 0 46 22
the 0 46 22
bishop.” 0 46 22

Indeed, 0 46 23
it 0 46 23
was 0 46 23
understood, 0 46 23
as 0 46 23
the 0 46 23
Washington 0 46 23
Post 0 46 23
said, 0 46 23
that 0 46 23
Francis’ 0 46 23
trip 0 46 23
to 0 46 23
Latin 0 46 23
America 0 46 23
– 0 46 23
dogged 0 46 23
by 0 46 23
protests 0 46 23
over 0 46 23
Barros 0 46 23
both 0 46 23
in 0 46 23
person 0 46 23
at 0 46 23
the 0 46 23
pope’s 0 46 23
appearances 0 46 23
and 0 46 23
in 0 46 23
the 0 46 23
press 0 46 23
– 0 46 23
was 0 46 23
in 0 46 23
part 0 46 23
intended 0 46 23
as 0 46 23
“an 0 46 23
apology 0 46 23
tour” 0 46 23
to 0 46 23
abuse 0 46 23
survivors. 0 46 23

Which 0 46 24
is 0 46 24
why 0 46 24
his 0 46 24
accusation 0 46 24
of 0 46 24
calumny 0 46 24
against 0 46 24
those 0 46 24
same 0 46 24
victims 0 46 24
the 0 46 24
next 0 46 24
day 0 46 24
came 0 46 24
as 0 46 24
such 0 46 24
a 0 46 24
shock 0 46 24
to 0 46 24
observers 0 46 24
unused 0 46 24
to 0 46 24
Bergoglio’s 0 46 24
ability 0 46 24
to 0 46 24
turn 0 46 24
on 0 46 24
a 0 46 24
dime. 0 46 24

All 0 46 25
was 0 46 25
going 0 46 25
as 0 46 25
planned. 0 46 25

On 0 46 26
Wednesday, 0 46 26
January 0 46 26
17, 0 46 26
the 0 46 26
pope 0 46 26
met 0 46 26
as 0 46 26
scheduled 0 46 26
with 0 46 26
selected 0 46 26
survivors 0 46 26
of 0 46 26
sexual 0 46 26
abuse 0 46 26
by 0 46 26
priests. 0 46 26

He 0 46 27
made 0 46 27
all 0 46 27
the 0 46 27
right 0 46 27
noises, 0 46 27
talking 0 46 27
about 0 46 27
his 0 46 27
“pain 0 46 27
and 0 46 27
shame,” 0 46 27
and 0 46 27
reportedly 0 46 27
even 0 46 27
crying, 0 46 27
at 0 46 27
what 0 46 27
happened. 0 46 27

“I 0 46 28
know 0 46 28
the 0 46 28
pain 0 46 28
of 0 46 28
these 0 46 28
cases 0 46 28
of 0 46 28
child 0 46 28

and 0 46 28
I 0 46 28
am 0 46 28
following 0 46 28
how 0 46 28
much 0 46 28
is 0 46 28
needed 0 46 28
to 0 46 28
overcome 0 46 28
this 0 46 28
serious 1 46 28
and 1 46 28
painful 1 46 28
evil,” 1 46 28
he 0 46 28
said. 0 46 28

24 0 46 29
hours 0 46 29
later 0 46 29
he 0 46 29
was 0 46 29

them 0 46 29
liars. 0 46 29

James 0 46 30
Hamilton, 0 46 30
49 0 46 30
and 0 46 30
now 0 46 30
a 0 46 30
doctor, 0 46 30
was 0 46 30
one 0 46 30
of 0 46 30
the 0 46 30
Barros 0 46 30
accusers. 0 46 30

He 0 46 31
told 0 46 31
the 0 46 31
BBC 0 46 31
at 0 46 31
a 0 46 31

Sorry 0 46 32

we 0 46 32
didn’t 0 46 32

of 0 46 32

broader 0 46 33
audience 0 46 33
during 0 46 33
the 0 46 33
most 0 46 33
recent 0 46 33
papal 0 46 33
trip, 0 46 33
the 0 46 33
outcry 0 46 33
has 0 46 33
been 0 46 33
ongoing 0 46 33
since 0 46 33
his 0 46 33
appointment 0 46 33
to 0 46 33
the 0 46 33
southern 0 46 33
Chilean 0 46 33
diocese 0 46 33
of 0 46 33
Osorno 0 46 33
in 0 46 33
2015. 0 46 33

Barros 0 46 34
was 0 46 34
a 0 46 34
student 0 46 34
protégée 0 46 34
of 0 46 34
the 1 46 34
charismatic 1 46 34
homosexual/pederast 1 46 34
predator 1 46 34
Fernando 1 46 34
Karadima, 1 46 34
and 0 46 34
went 0 46 34
on 0 46 34
to 0 46 34
be 0 46 34
ordained 0 46 34
in 0 46 34
1984, 0 46 34
made 0 46 34
bishop 0 46 34
in 0 46 34
1995 0 46 34
and 0 46 34
appointed 0 46 34
as 0 46 34
bishop 0 46 34
of 0 46 34
the 0 46 34
armed 0 46 34
forces. 0 46 34

Barros 0 46 35
claimed 0 46 35
in 0 46 35
court 0 46 35
that 0 46 35
the 0 46 35
first 0 46 35
he 0 46 35
knew 0 46 35
of 0 46 35
Karadima’s 0 46 35
offenses 0 46 35
was 0 46 35
on 0 46 35
a 0 46 35
Chilean 0 46 35
television 0 46 35
programme 0 46 35
in 0 46 35
2010. 0 46 35

This 0 46 36
is 0 46 36
refuted 0 46 36
by 0 46 36
Karadima’s 0 46 36
victims 0 46 36
– 0 46 36
deemed 0 46 36
credible 0 46 36
both 0 46 36
by 0 46 36
the 0 46 36
secular 0 46 36
courts 0 46 36
and 0 46 36
the 0 46 36
Vatican 0 46 36
tribunal 0 46 36
– 0 46 36
who 0 46 36
testified 0 46 36
that 0 46 36
he 0 46 36
personally 0 46 36
witnessed 0 46 36
the 0 46 36
abuse 0 46 36
at 0 46 36
Sacred 0 46 36
Heart 0 46 36
of 0 46 36
Jesus 0 46 36
church 0 46 36
in 0 46 36
Santiago. 0 46 36

Last 0 46 37
Thursday, 0 46 37
however, 0 46 37
was 0 46 37
not 0 46 37
the 0 46 37
first 0 46 37
time 0 46 37
Francis, 0 46 37
confronted 0 46 37
unexpectedly 0 46 37
in 0 46 37
public 0 46 37
over 0 46 37
the 0 46 37
Barros 0 46 37
question, 0 46 37
has 0 46 37
responded 0 46 37
testily 0 46 37
and 0 46 37
with 0 46 37
insults. 0 46 37

In 0 46 38
2015 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
Italian 0 46 38
newspaper 0 46 38
Il 0 46 38
Fatto 0 46 38
Quotidiano 0 46 38
published 0 46 38
a 0 46 38
video 0 46 38
of 0 46 38
him 0 46 38
scolding 0 46 38
two 0 46 38
women 0 46 38
who 0 46 38
spoke 0 46 38
with 0 46 38
him 0 46 38
in 0 46 38
St. 0 46 38
Peter’s 0 46 38
Piazza, 0 46 38
asking 0 46 38
that 0 46 38
he 0 46 38
reconsider 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
appointment, 0 46 38
citing 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
“suffering” 0 46 38
of 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
Church 0 46 38
in 0 46 38
Chile 0 46 38
over 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
issue. 0 46 38

The 0 46 39
pope 0 46 39
told 0 46 39
the 0 46 39
women, 0 46 39
“The 0 46 39
Church 0 46 39
has 0 46 39
lost 0 46 39
its 0 46 39
freedom, 0 46 39
letting 0 46 39
its 0 46 39
head 0 46 39
fill 0 46 39
with 0 46 39
politicians 0 46 39
and 0 46 39
accusing 0 46 39
a 0 46 39
bishop 0 46 39
without 0 46 39
having 0 46 39
any 0 46 39
proof, 0 46 39
after 0 46 39
twenty 0 46 39
years 0 46 39
of 0 46 39
service, 0 46 39
so 0 46 39
think 1 46 39
with 1 46 39
your 1 46 39
head.” 1 46 39
He 0 46 39
warned 0 46 39
them 0 46 39
not 0 46 39
to 0 46 39
allow 0 46 39
themselves 0 46 39
to 0 46 39
be 0 46 39
led 0 46 39
by 0 46 39
“leftists 1 46 39
who 1 46 39
have 1 46 39
set 1 46 39
up 1 46 39
this 1 46 39
thing.” 1 46 39

“The 0 46 40
only 0 46 40
charge 0 46 40
against 0 46 40
this 0 46 40
bishop 0 46 40
has 0 46 40
been 0 46 40
discredited 0 46 40
by 0 46 40
the 0 46 40
Court 0 46 40
of 0 46 40
Justice, 0 46 40
so 0 46 40
please 0 46 40
do 0 46 40
not 0 46 40
lose 0 46 40
your 0 46 40
serenity, 0 46 40
you 0 46 40
suffer, 0 46 40
but 0 46 40
because 0 46 40
you 1 46 40
are 1 46 40
foolish...I 1 46 40
am 0 46 40
the 0 46 40
first 0 46 40
to 0 46 40
judge 0 46 40
and 0 46 40
punish 0 46 40
those 0 46 40
accused 0 46 40
of 0 46 40
similar 0 46 40
crimes, 0 46 40
but 0 46 40
in 0 46 40
this 0 46 40
case 0 46 40
there 0 46 40
is 0 46 40
not 0 46 40
even 0 46 40
a 0 46 40
proof.” 0 46 40

The 0 46 41
insults 0 46 41
were 0 46 41
not 0 46 41
forgotten. 0 46 41

Among 0 46 42
the 0 46 42
signs 0 46 42
held 0 46 42
by 0 46 42
protesters 0 46 42
in 0 46 42
Chile 0 46 42
last 0 46 42
week 0 46 42
were 0 46 42
those 0 46 42
reading, 0 46 42
“Ni 0 46 42
zurdos, 0 46 42
ni 0 46 42
tontos,” 0 46 42
(Neither 1 46 42
lefties 1 46 42
nor 1 46 42
stupid). 1 46 42

The 0 46 43
jab 0 46 43
certainly 0 46 43
wasn’t 0 46 43
lost 0 46 43
on 0 46 43
Francis, 0 46 43
since 0 46 43
the 0 46 43
signs 0 46 43
were 0 46 43
being 0 46 43
held 0 46 43
by 0 46 43
protesters 0 46 43
the 0 46 43
full 0 46 43
length 0 46 43
of 0 46 43
his 0 46 43
auto 0 46 43
route 0 46 43
to 0 46 43
Santiago 0 46 43
from 0 46 43
the 0 46 43
airport. 0 46 43

One 0 46 44
of 0 46 44
the 0 46 44
protesters 0 46 44
told 0 46 44
the 0 46 44
BBC, 0 46 44
“He 0 46 44
doesn’t 0 46 44
even 0 46 44
know 0 46 44
us, 0 46 44
so 0 46 44
how 0 46 44
can 0 46 44
he 0 46 44
accuse 0 46 44
us 0 46 44
of 0 46 44
being 0 46 44
such 0 46 44
things? 0 46 44

He 0 46 45
thinks 0 46 45
we 0 46 45
are 0 46 45
politically 0 46 45
motivated 0 46 45
even 0 46 45
though 0 46 45
we 0 46 45
come 0 46 45
from 0 46 45
different 0 46 45
parishes 0 46 45
in 0 46 45
Osorno 0 46 45
and 0 46 45
are 0 46 45
doing 0 46 45
this 0 46 45
because 0 46 45
we 0 46 45
are 0 46 45
against 0 46 45
priests 0 46 45
being 0 46 45
allowed 0 46 45
to 0 46 45
abuse 0 46 45
children.” 0 46 45

Apparently 0 46 46
His 0 46 46
Holiness 0 46 46
was 0 46 46
informed 0 46 46
that 0 46 46
the 0 46 46
“calumny” 1 46 46
comment 1 46 46
had 0 46 46
caused 0 46 46
some 0 46 46
blow-back 0 46 46
because 0 46 46
a 0 46 46
couple 0 46 46
of 0 46 46
days 0 46 46
later 0 46 46
we 0 46 46
got 0 46 46
something 0 46 46
touted 0 46 46
– 0 46 46
though 0 46 46
somewhat 0 46 46
skeptically 0 46 46
– 0 46 46
as 0 46 46
a 0 46 46
“contrite” 0 46 46
papal 0 46 46
apology. 0 46 46

This 0 46 47
also 0 46 47
followed 0 46 47
an 0 46 47
astonishing 0 46 47
public 0 46 47
rebuke 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
pope 0 46 47
by 0 46 47
Sean 0 46 47
Cardinal 0 46 47
O’Malley 0 46 47
– 0 46 47
a 0 46 47
member 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
C9 0 46 47
council 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
cardinals 0 46 47
and 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
former 0 46 47
head 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
pope’s 0 46 47
sex 0 46 47
abuse 0 46 47
commission 0 46 47
– 0 46 47
who 0 46 47
said, 0 46 47
“It 0 46 47
is 0 46 47
understandable 0 46 47
that 0 46 47
Pope 0 46 47
Francis’ 0 46 47
statements 0 46 47
yesterday 0 46 47
in 0 46 47
Santiago, 0 46 47
Chile 0 46 47
were 0 46 47
a 0 46 47
source 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
great 0 46 47
pain 0 46 47
for 0 46 47
survivors 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
sexual 0 46 47
abuse 0 46 47
by 0 46 47
clergy 0 46 47
or 0 46 47
any 0 46 47
other 0 46 47
perpetrator.” 0 46 47

“Pope 0 46 48
Francis 0 46 48
fully 0 46 48
recognizes 0 46 48
the 1 46 48
egregious 1 46 48
failures 1 46 48
of 0 46 48
the 0 46 48
Church 0 46 48
and 0 46 48
its 0 46 48
clergy 0 46 48
who 0 46 48
abused 0 46 48
children 0 46 48
and 0 46 48
the 0 46 48
devastating 1 46 48
impact 1 46 48
those 0 46 48
crimes 0 46 48
have 0 46 48
had 0 46 48
on 0 46 48
survivors 0 46 48
and 0 46 48
their 0 46 48
loved 0 46 48
ones,” 0 46 48
O’Malley 0 46 48
said. 0 46 48

Of 0 46 49
course, 0 46 49
Francis 0 46 49
being 0 46 49
Francis 0 46 49
the 0 46 49
apology 0 46 49
was 0 46 49
banked 0 46 49
around 0 46 49
with 0 46 49
assertions 0 46 49
of 0 46 49
how 0 46 49
right 0 46 49
he 0 46 49
was. 0 46 49

“I 0 46 50
have 0 46 50
to 0 46 50
ask 0 46 50
forgiveness 0 46 50
because 0 46 50
the 0 46 50
word 0 46 50
‘proof’ 0 46 50
wounded,” 0 46 50
he 0 46 50
said. 0 46 50

“It 0 46 51
wounded 0 46 51
many 0 46 51
people 0 46 51
who 0 46 51
were 0 46 51
abused…I 0 46 51
ask 0 46 51
them 0 46 51
for 0 46 51
forgiveness 0 46 51
because 0 46 51
I 0 46 51
wounded 0 46 51
them 0 46 51
without 0 46 51
realizing 0 46 51
it, 0 46 51
but 0 46 51
it 0 46 51
was 0 46 51
an 0 46 51
unintended 0 46 51
wound. 0 46 51

And 0 46 52
this 1 46 52
horrified 1 46 52
me 1 46 52
a 1 46 52
lot, 1 46 52
because 0 46 52
I 0 46 52
had 0 46 52
received 0 46 52
them.” 0 46 52

“And 0 46 53
I 0 46 53
know 0 46 53
how 0 46 53
much 0 46 53
they 0 46 53
suffer, 0 46 53
to 0 46 53
feel 0 46 53
that 0 46 53
the 0 46 53
Pope 0 46 53
says 0 46 53
in 0 46 53
their 0 46 53
face 0 46 53
‘bring 0 46 53
me 0 46 53
a 0 46 53
letter, 0 46 53
a 0 46 53
proof.’ 0 46 53
It’s 0 46 53
a 0 46 53
slap. 0 46 53

And 0 46 54
I 0 46 54
agree 0 46 54
that 0 46 54
my 0 46 54
expression 0 46 54
was 0 46 54
not 0 46 54
apt, 0 46 54
because 0 46 54
I 0 46 54
didn’t 0 46 54
think.” 0 46 54

He 0 46 55
doubled 0 46 55
down, 0 46 55
saying, 0 46 55
“I 0 46 55
have 0 46 55
not 0 46 55
heard 0 46 55
any 0 46 55
victim 0 46 55
of 0 46 55
Barros. 0 46 55

They 0 46 56
did 0 46 56
not 0 46 56
come, 0 46 56
they 0 46 56
did 0 46 56
not 0 46 56
show 0 46 56
themselves, 0 46 56
they 0 46 56
did 0 46 56
not 0 46 56
give 0 46 56
evidence 0 46 56
in 0 46 56
court. 0 46 56

It’s 1 46 57
all 1 46 57
in 1 46 57
the 1 46 57
air. 1 46 57

It 0 46 58
is 0 46 58
true 0 46 58
that 0 46 58
Barros 0 46 58
was 0 46 58
in 0 46 58
Karadima’s 0 46 58
group 0 46 58
of 0 46 58
young 0 46 58
people. 0 46 58

But 0 46 59
let 0 46 59
us 0 46 59
be 0 46 59
clear: 0 46 59
if 0 46 59
you 0 46 59
accuse 0 46 59
someone 0 46 59
without 0 46 59
evidence 0 46 59
with 0 46 59
pertinacity, 0 46 59
that 0 46 59
is 0 46 59
calumny.” 0 46 59

“This 0 46 60
is 0 46 60
what 0 46 60
I 0 46 60
can 0 46 60
say 0 46 60
with 0 46 60
sincerity. 0 46 60

Barros 0 46 61
will 0 46 61
remain 0 46 61
there 0 46 61
if 0 46 61
I 0 46 61
don’t 0 46 61
find 0 46 61
a 0 46 61
way 0 46 61
to 0 46 61
condemn 0 46 61
him. 0 46 61

I 0 46 62
cannot 0 46 62
condemn 0 46 62
him 0 46 62
if 0 46 62
I 0 46 62
don’t 0 46 62
have 0 46 62
– 0 46 62
I 0 46 62
don’t 0 46 62
say 0 46 62
proof 0 46 62
– 0 46 62
but 0 46 62
evidence. 0 46 62

And 0 46 63
there 0 46 63
are 0 46 63
many 0 46 63
ways 0 46 63
to 0 46 63
get 0 46 63
evidence. 0 46 63

Is 0 46 64
that 0 46 64
clear?” 0 46 64

This 0 46 65
“contrite” 0 46 65
papal 0 46 65
apology 0 46 65
didn’t 0 46 65
fly 0 46 65
well 0 46 65
even 0 46 65
with 0 46 65
the 0 46 65
regular 0 46 65
news 0 46 65
reporters. 0 46 65

Philip 0 46 66
Pullela, 0 46 66
a 0 46 66
reporter 0 46 66
on 0 46 66
the 0 46 66
plane 0 46 66
for 0 46 66
Reuters, 0 46 66
described 0 46 66
it 0 46 66
as 0 46 66
“an 0 46 66
extremely 0 46 66
rare 0 46 66
act 0 46 66
of 0 46 66
self-criticism,” 0 46 66
for 0 46 66
the 0 46 66
“unusually 1 46 66
contrite” 1 46 66
Bergoglio, 0 46 66
and 0 46 66
noted 0 46 66
that, 0 46 66
“While 0 46 66
the 0 46 66
pope 0 46 66
has 0 46 66
vowed 0 46 66
‘zero 0 46 66
tolerance’ 0 46 66
for 0 46 66
sexual 0 46 66
abuse, 0 46 66
his 0 46 66
efforts 0 46 66
have 0 46 66
sputtered.” 0 46 66

Indeed, 0 46 67
Francis 0 46 67
claim 0 46 67
that 0 46 67
he 0 46 67
met 0 46 67
with 0 46 67
and 0 46 67
heard 0 46 67
the 0 46 67
“pain” 0 46 67
of 0 46 67
the 0 46 67
victims 0 46 67
is 0 46 67
untrue 0 46 67
in 0 46 67
the 0 46 67
specific 0 46 67
case 0 46 67
in 0 46 67
hand. 0 46 67

CBS 0 46 68
News 0 46 68
reports 0 46 68
that 0 46 68
though 0 46 68
the 0 46 68
Osorno 0 46 68
group 0 46 68
had 0 46 68
tried 0 46 68
to 0 46 68
obtain 0 46 68
a 0 46 68
meeting 0 46 68
during 0 46 68
the 0 46 68
trip 0 46 68
they 0 46 68
were 0 46 68
refused. 0 46 68

Greg 0 46 69
Burke, 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
pope’s 0 46 69
press 0 46 69
officer, 0 46 69
confirmed 0 46 69
that 0 46 69
“no 0 46 69
papal 0 46 69
meetings 0 46 69
were 0 46 69
planned 0 46 69
with 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
Osorno 0 46 69
group, 0 46 69
which 0 46 69
had 0 46 69
formally 0 46 69
requested 0 46 69
to 0 46 69
meet 0 46 69
with 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
pope 0 46 69
in 0 46 69
July 0 46 69
but 0 46 69
were 0 46 69
told 0 46 69
by 0 46 69
Vatican 0 46 69
organizers 0 46 69
that 0 46 69
his 0 46 69
schedule 0 46 69
was 0 46 69
already 0 46 69
final, 0 46 69
some 0 46 69
six 0 46 69
months 0 46 69
before 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
trip.” 0 46 69

Who 0 46 70
is 0 46 70
Barros? 0 46 70

Some 0 46 71
may 0 46 71
remember 0 46 71
a 0 46 71
video 0 46 71
that 0 46 71
made 0 46 71
the 0 46 71
internet 0 46 71
rounds 0 46 71
of 0 46 71
an 0 46 71
uproar 0 46 71
in 0 46 71
a 0 46 71
Chilean 0 46 71
cathedral 0 46 71
at 0 46 71
the 0 46 71
installation 0 46 71
ceremony 0 46 71
of 0 46 71
a 0 46 71
bishop. 0 46 71

At 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
time 0 46 72
it 0 46 72
didn’t 0 46 72
draw 0 46 72
much 0 46 72
attention 0 46 72
from 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
English 0 46 72
language 0 46 72
press 0 46 72
– 0 46 72
mostly 0 46 72
at 0 46 72
that 0 46 72
time 0 46 72
distracted 0 46 72
by 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
ongoing 0 46 72
battle 0 46 72
of 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
notorious 0 46 72
Kasper 0 46 72
Proposal 0 46 72
and 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
oncoming 0 46 72
Synods. 0 46 72

But 0 46 73
despite 0 46 73
the 0 46 73
pope’s 0 46 73
claim, 0 46 73
the 0 46 73
charges 0 46 73
against 0 46 73
Barros 0 46 73
are 0 46 73
serious 0 46 73
and 0 46 73
have 0 46 73
been 0 46 73
deemed 0 46 73
credible 0 46 73
by 0 46 73
a 0 46 73
judge. 0 46 73

He 0 46 74
is 0 46 74
accused 0 46 74
of 0 46 74
having 0 46 74
covered 0 46 74
up 0 46 74
sexual 0 46 74
abuse, 0 46 74
including 0 46 74
destroying 0 46 74
evidence, 0 46 74
committed 0 46 74
by 0 46 74
Karadima 0 46 74
in 0 46 74
the 0 46 74
‘80s 0 46 74
and 0 46 74
‘90s. 0 46 74

In 0 46 75
fact 0 46 75
– 0 46 75
and 0 46 75
this 0 46 75
point 0 46 75
has 0 46 75
tended 0 46 75
to 0 46 75
get 0 46 75
glossed 0 46 75
over 0 46 75
in 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
press 0 46 75
– 0 46 75
Barros 0 46 75
is 0 46 75
accused 0 46 75
by 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
victims 0 46 75
of 0 46 75
having 0 46 75
been 0 46 75
in 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
room, 0 46 75
watching 0 46 75
at 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
time, 0 46 75
and 0 46 75
of 0 46 75
engaging 0 46 75
in 0 46 75
sexual 0 46 75
activity 0 46 75
with 0 46 75
Karadima. 0 46 75

This 0 46 76
is 0 46 76
not, 0 46 76
therefore, 0 46 76
merely 0 46 76
a 0 46 76
matter 0 46 76
of 0 46 76
a 0 46 76
bishop 0 46 76
or 0 46 76
colleague 0 46 76
discovering 0 46 76
the 0 46 76
abuse 0 46 76
after 0 46 76
the 0 46 76
fact, 0 46 76
but 0 46 76
of 0 46 76
being 0 46 76
a 1 46 76
voyeuristic 1 46 76
participant. 1 46 76

Juan 0 46 77
Carlos 0 46 77
Cruz, 0 46 77
told 0 46 77
the 0 46 77
press 0 46 77
in 0 46 77
2015 0 46 77
that 0 46 77
he 0 46 77
and 0 46 77
another 0 46 77
boy 0 46 77
– 0 46 77
both 0 46 77
in 0 46 77
their 0 46 77
teens 0 46 77
at 0 46 77
the 0 46 77
time 0 46 77
– 0 46 77
“would 0 46 77
lie 0 46 77
down 0 46 77
on 0 46 77
the 0 46 77
priest’s 0 46 77
[Karadima’s] 0 46 77
bed, 0 46 77
one 0 46 77

another 0 46 77
sitting 0 46 77
near 0 46 77
his 0 46 77
feet. 0 46 77

The 0 46 78
priest 0 46 78
would 0 46 78
kiss 0 46 78
the 0 46 78
boys 0 46 78
and 0 46 78
grope 0 46 78
them, 0 46 78
he 0 46 78
said, 0 46 78
all 0 46 78
while 0 46 78
the 0 46 78
Rev. 0 46 78

Juan 0 46 79
Barros 0 46 79
watched.” 0 46 79
Cruz, 0 46 79
now 0 46 79
a 0 46 79
51-year-old 0 46 79
“gay” 0 46 79
journalist, 0 46 79
told 0 46 79
The 0 46 79
Associated 0 46 79
Press, 0 46 79
“Barros 0 46 79
was 0 46 79
there, 0 46 79
and 0 46 79
he 0 46 79
saw 0 46 79
it 0 46 79
all.” 0 46 79

A 0 46 80
Vatican 0 46 80
investigation 0 46 80
found 0 46 80
Karadima 0 46 80
guilty 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
2011 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
sentenced 0 46 80
him 0 46 80
to 0 46 80
a 0 46 80
life 0 46 80
of 0 46 80
seclusion 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
a 0 46 80
monastery 0 46 80
for 0 46 80
“penitence 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
prayer.” 0 46 80
Note 0 46 80
that 0 46 80
date; 0 46 80
2011 0 46 80
was 0 46 80
when 0 46 80
the 0 46 80
processes 0 46 80
for 0 46 80
investigating 0 46 80

trying 0 46 80
priest-abusers, 1 46 80
put 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
place 0 46 80

were 0 46 80
still 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
effect, 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
while 0 46 80
he 0 46 80
was 0 46 80
still 0 46 80
sitting 0 46 80
on 0 46 80
the 0 46 80
Petrine 0 46 80
throne. 0 46 80

Things 0 46 81
are 0 46 81
a 0 46 81
bit 0 46 81
different 0 46 81
now. 0 46 81

Neither 0 46 82
was 0 46 82
the 0 46 82
complaint 0 46 82
against 0 46 82
Barros 0 46 82
without 0 46 82
the 0 46 82
support 0 46 82
of 0 46 82
responsible 0 46 82
people. 0 46 82

The 0 46 83
media 0 46 83
reported 0 46 83
that 0 46 83
over 0 46 83
1,300 0 46 83
Catholic 0 46 83
faithful 0 46 83
in 0 46 83
Osorno, 0 46 83

51 0 46 83

Parliament, 0 46 83
wrote 0 46 83

the 0 46 83

asking 0 46 83
him 0 46 83
to 0 46 83
rescind 0 46 83
the 0 46 83
appointment 0 46 83
– 0 46 83
none 0 46 83
of 0 46 83
which 0 46 83

any 0 46 83

Fr. 0 46 84

Peter 0 46 85
Kleigel, 0 46 85
a 0 46 85
priest 0 46 85
of 0 46 85
Osorno, 0 46 85
told 0 46 85
Associated 0 46 85
Press, 0 46 85
“We’re 0 46 85
convinced 0 46 85
that 0 46 85
this 0 46 85
appointment 0 46 85
is 0 46 85
not 0 46 85
correct 0 46 85
because, 0 46 85
following 0 46 85
canon 0 46 85
law, 0 46 85
a 0 46 85
bishop 0 46 85
must 0 46 85
be 0 46 85
well-regarded. 0 46 85

We 0 46 86
need 0 46 86
a 0 46 86
bishop 0 46 86
who’s 0 46 86
credible.” 0 46 86

The 0 46 87
problem 0 46 87
with 0 46 87
getting 0 46 87
the 0 46 87
news 0 46 87
out 0 46 87
about 0 46 87

as 0 46 87
in 0 46 87
most 0 46 87
of 0 46 87
these 0 46 87

It 0 46 88
was 0 46 88
certainly 0 46 88
never 0 46 88
a 0 46 88

his 0 46 93

annulled. 0 46 93

Again, 0 46 94
Errázuriz 0 46 94
refused 0 46 94
to 0 46 94
take 0 46 94
action 0 46 94
against 0 46 94
Karadima.” 0 46 94

The 0 46 95
pope’s 0 46 95
claim 0 46 95
that 0 46 95
there 0 46 95
is 0 46 95
“no 0 46 95
evidence” 0 46 95
flies 0 46 95
in 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
face 0 46 95
of 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
ruling 0 46 95
of 0 46 95
the 0 46 95

judge 0 46 95
in 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
Karadima 0 46 95
case 0 46 95
– 0 46 95
a 0 46 95
fact 0 46 95
that 0 46 95
ought 0 46 95
to 0 46 95
be 0 46 95
of 0 46 95
paramount 0 46 95
consideration 0 46 95

determining 0 46 95
credibility 0 46 95
in 0 46 95
such 0 46 95
cases. 0 46 95

While 0 46 96
Judge 0 46 96
Jessica 0 46 96
Gonzalez 0 46 96
was 0 46 96
forced 0 46 96
to 0 46 96
drop 0 46 96
criminal 0 46 96
charges 0 46 96
because 0 46 96
the 0 46 96
statute 0 46 96
of 0 46 96
limitations 0 46 96

she 0 46 96
affirmed 0 46 96
that 0 46 96

by 0 46 96
Cruz 0 46 96
and 0 46 96
other 0 46 96

was 0 46 96
credible. 0 46 96

After 0 46 97
a 0 46 97
full 0 46 97
year 0 46 97
of 0 46 97
investigation, 0 46 97
Gonzalez 0 46 97
called 0 46 97
their 0 46 97
claims 0 46 97
“truthful 0 46 97
and 0 46 97
reliable”. 0 46 97

Victims 0 46 98

of 0 46 98
Karadima’s 0 46 98
abuse 0 46 98
in 0 46 98
1982 0 46 98
was 0 46 98
intercepted 0 46 98
and 0 46 98
destroyed 0 46 98
by 0 46 98
Barros, 0 46 98
who 0 46 98
was 0 46 98
serving 0 46 98
at 0 46 98
the 0 46 98
time 0 46 98

As 0 46 99
for 0 46 99

general 0 46 99
credibility 0 46 99
as 0 46 99
a 0 46 99
Catholic 0 46 99

the 0 46 99
witness 0 46 99
of 0 46 99
the 0 46 99
victims 0 46 99
is 0 46 99
damning. 0 46 99

In 0 46 100
a 0 46 100
letter 0 46 100
to 0 46 100
Bishop 0 46 100
Ivo 0 46 100
Scapolo, 0 46 100
papal 0 46 100
nuncio 0 46 100
to 0 46 100
Chile, 0 46 100
that 0 46 100
Cruz 0 46 100
gave 0 46 100
to 0 46 100
the 0 46 100
Associated 0 46 100
Press, 0 46 100
he 0 46 100
said 0 46 100
he 0 46 100
witnessed 0 46 100
Karadima 0 46 100
and 0 46 100
Barros 0 46 100
in 0 46 100
an 0 46 100
intimate 0 46 100
relationship. 0 46 100

“I 0 46 101
saw 0 46 101
Karadima 0 46 101
and 0 46 101
Juan 0 46 101
Barros 0 46 101
kissing 0 46 101
and 0 46 101
touching 0 46 101
each 0 46 101
other. 0 46 101

The 0 46 102
groping 0 46 102
generally 0 46 102
came 0 46 102
from 0 46 102
Karadima 0 46 102
touching 0 46 102
Barros’ 0 46 102
genitals”. 0 46 102

Barros 0 46 103
has 0 46 103
never 0 46 103
denied 0 46 103
having 0 46 103
had 0 46 103
a 0 46 103
close 0 46 103
friendship 0 46 103
with 0 46 103
Karadima. 0 46 103

Hamilton 0 46 104
confirmed 0 46 104
this 0 46 104
saying, 0 46 104
“I 0 46 104
saw 0 46 104
how 0 46 104
Barros 0 46 104
watched 0 46 104
it 0 46 104
all.” 0 46 104

And 0 46 105
the 0 46 105
matter 0 46 105
didn’t 0 46 105
end 0 46 105
in 0 46 105
2010. 0 46 105

Emails 0 46 106

in 0 46 106
Chile 0 46 106
in 0 46 106
2015 0 46 106
showed 0 46 106
that 0 46 106
Cardinal 0 46 106
Errázuriz 0 46 106
also 0 46 106
blocked 0 46 106
the 0 46 106
appointment 0 46 106
of 0 46 106
Juan 0 46 106
Carlos 0 46 106

the 0 46 106
new 0 46 106
child 0 46 106
protection 0 46 106
commission 0 46 106
– 0 46 106
a 0 46 106
group 0 46 106
plagued 1 46 106
by 0 46 106
such 0 46 106
scandals 0 46 106
and 0 46 106
eventually 0 46 106
ignored 1 46 106
to 1 46 106
death 1 46 106
by 0 46 106
Francis. 0 46 106

Which 0 46 107
brings 0 46 107
us 0 46 107
to 0 46 107
Francis 0 46 107
Bergoglio’s 0 46 107
own 0 46 107
record 0 46 107
in 0 46 107
this 0 46 107
area. 0 46 107

The 0 46 108
pope 0 46 108
claimed 0 46 108
“I 0 46 108
am 0 46 108
the 0 46 108
first 0 46 108
to 0 46 108
judge 0 46 108
and 0 46 108
punish 0 46 108
those 0 46 108
accused 0 46 108
of 0 46 108
similar 0 46 108
crimes,” 0 46 108
but 0 46 108
this 0 46 108
claim 0 46 108
is 0 46 108
not 0 46 108
supported 0 46 108
by 0 46 108
the 0 46 108
reality. 0 46 108

Indeed, 0 46 109
it 0 46 109
has 0 46 109
been 0 46 109
pointed 0 46 109
out 0 46 109
that 0 46 109
Francis 0 46 109
has 0 46 109
gone 0 46 109
to 0 46 109
considerable 0 46 109
lengths 0 46 109
to 0 46 109
dismantle 0 46 109
the 0 46 109
efforts 0 46 109
of 0 46 109
his 0 46 109
predecessor 0 46 109
at 0 46 109
“safeguarding” 0 46 109
young 0 46 109
people, 0 46 109
punishing 0 46 109
abusers 0 46 109
and 0 46 109
removing 0 46 109
bishops 0 46 109
who 0 46 109
cover 0 46 109
it 0 46 109
up. 0 46 109

In 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
case 0 46 110
of 0 46 110
Barros, 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
Associated 0 46 110
Press 0 46 110
obtained 0 46 110
a 0 46 110

Pope 0 46 110
Francis 0 46 110
dated 0 46 110
2015 0 46 110

Just 0 46 110
days 0 46 110
before 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
pope’s 0 46 110
“calumny” 0 46 110
comment, 0 46 110
January 0 46 110
11, 0 46 110
AP 0 46 110
reported 0 46 110
that 0 46 110
Francis 0 46 110
had 0 46 110
full 0 46 110
knowledge 0 46 110
of 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
controversy 0 46 110
he 0 46 110
risked 0 46 110
in 0 46 110
appointing 0 46 110
Barros 0 46 110
to 0 46 110
Osorno. 0 46 110

“[H]is 0 46 111
ambassador 0 46 111

to 0 46 111
find 0 46 111
a 0 46 111
way 0 46 111
to 0 46 111
contain 0 46 111
the 0 46 111
damage 0 46 111

before 0 46 111
the 0 46 111
case 0 46 111
made 0 46 111
headlines.” 0 46 111

The 0 46 112
letter, 0 46 112
addressed 0 46 112
to 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
executive 0 46 112
committee 0 46 112
of 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
Chilean 0 46 112
bishops’ 0 46 112
conference, 0 46 112
said, 0 46 112
“Thank 0 46 112
you 0 46 112
for 0 46 112
having 0 46 112
openly 0 46 112
demonstrated 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
concern 0 46 112
that 0 46 112
you 0 46 112
have 0 46 112
about 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
appointment 0 46 112
of 0 46 112
Monsignor 0 46 112
Juan 0 46 112
Barros. 0 46 112

I 0 46 113
understand 0 46 113
what 0 46 113
you’re 0 46 113
telling 0 46 113
me 0 46 113
and 0 46 113
I’m 0 46 113
aware 0 46 113
that 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
situation 0 46 113
of 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
church 0 46 113
in 0 46 113
Chile 0 46 113
is 0 46 113
difficult 0 46 113
due 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
trials 0 46 113
you’ve 0 46 113
had 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
undergo.” 0 46 113
The 0 46 113
letter 0 46 113
said 0 46 113
that 0 46 113
in 0 46 113
2014 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
nuncio, 0 46 113
Archbishop 0 46 113
Scapolo, 0 46 113
had 0 46 113
asked 0 46 113
Barros 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
resign 0 46 113
as 0 46 113
bishop 0 46 113
of 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
armed 0 46 113
forces 0 46 113
and 0 46 113
had 0 46 113
“encouraged 0 46 113
him 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
take 0 46 113
a 0 46 113
sabbatical 0 46 113
year 0 46 113
before 0 46 113
assuming 0 46 113
any 0 46 113

pastoral 0 46 113
responsibility 0 46 113
as 0 46 113
a 0 46 113
bishop.” 0 46 113

There 0 46 114
can 0 46 114
also 0 46 114
be 0 46 114
little 0 46 114
doubt 0 46 114
the 0 46 114
new 0 46 114
pope 0 46 114
was 0 46 114
fully 0 46 114
aware 0 46 114
of 0 46 114
the 0 46 114
record 0 46 114
of 0 46 114
his 0 46 114
close 0 46 114
friend 0 46 114
Cardinal 0 46 114
Errázuriz 0 46 114
in 0 46 114
ignoring 0 46 114
complaints 0 46 114
of 0 46 114
Karadima’s 0 46 114
victims 0 46 114
when 0 46 114
he 0 46 114

him 0 46 114
to 0 46 114
the 0 46 114
C9 0 46 114
council. 0 46 114

And 0 46 115
even 0 46 115
if 0 46 115
he 0 46 115
didn’t 0 46 115
then, 0 46 115
he 0 46 115
certainly 0 46 115
knows 0 46 115
now, 0 46 115
and 0 46 115
yet 0 46 115
Errazuriz 0 46 115
continues 0 46 115
in 0 46 115
that 0 46 115
advisory 0 46 115
role. 0 46 115

Francis 0 46 116
further 0 46 116

Among 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
earliest 0 46 118
indications 0 46 118
Catholics 0 46 118
had 0 46 118
that 0 46 118
the 0 46 118

had 0 46 118
no 0 46 118

of 0 46 118
the 0 46 118

forgotten 0 46 119
that 0 46 119
Bergoglio’s 0 46 119
notorious 0 46 119
comment 0 46 119
“who 1 46 119
am 1 46 119
I 1 46 119
to 1 46 119
judge” 1 46 119
was 0 46 119
in 0 46 119
response 0 46 119
to 0 46 119
a 0 46 119
question 0 46 119
on 0 46 119
a 0 46 119
plane-presser 0 46 119
about 0 46 119
Ricca, 0 46 119
and 0 46 119
was 0 46 119
followed 0 46 119
with 0 46 119
a 0 46 119
similar 0 46 119
claim 0 46 119
from 0 46 119
Francis 0 46 119
about 0 46 119
there 0 46 119
having 0 46 119
been 0 46 119
no 0 46 119
proof 0 46 119
of 0 46 119
his 0 46 119
misbehaviour. 0 46 119

As 0 46 120
the 0 46 120
pseudonymous 0 46 120
Marcantonio 0 46 120
Colonna 0 46 120
wrote 0 46 120
in 0 46 120
the 0 46 120
book, 0 46 120
“The 0 46 120
Dictator 0 46 120
Pope,” 0 46 120
“In 0 46 120
fact 0 46 120
his 0 46 120
patronage 0 46 120
of 0 46 120
Monsignor 0 46 120
Ricca 0 46 120
fits 0 46 120
the 0 46 120
pattern 0 46 120
which 0 46 120
was 0 46 120
well 0 46 120
established 0 46 120
when 0 46 120
he 0 46 120
was 0 46 120
Archbishop 0 46 120
of 0 46 120
Buenos 0 46 120

have 0 46 120
them 0 46 120
under 1 46 120
his 1 46 120
thumb.” 1 46 120

But 0 46 121
even 0 46 121
before 0 46 121
this 0 46 121
was 0 46 121
the 1 46 121
sinister 1 46 121
appearance 1 46 121
of 0 46 121

prominence 0 46 122
in 0 46 122
the 0 46 122
Bergoglian 0 46 122
pontificate 0 46 122
continues 0 46 122
to 0 46 122
be 0 46 122
the 0 46 122
most 0 46 122
prominent 0 46 122
indicator 0 46 122
of 0 46 122
the 0 46 122

of 0 46 122

The 0 46 123
former 0 46 123
head 0 46 123
of 0 46 123
the 0 46 123
Brussels 0 46 123

was 0 46 123
a 0 46 123
leading 0 46 123
figure 0 46 123
in 0 46 123
the 0 46 123
so-called 0 46 123
St. 0 46 123
Gallen 0 46 123
Group, 0 46 123
which 0 46 123
he 0 46 123
himself 0 46 123
described 0 46 123
as 0 46 123
a 0 46 123
“mafia,” 1 46 123
who 0 46 123
had 0 46 123
worked 0 46 123
against 0 46 123
the 0 46 123
election 0 46 123

Joseph 0 46 123
Ratzinger 0 46 123

2005 0 46 123

to 0 46 123
elect 0 46 123
Bergoglio 0 46 123
in 0 46 123
2013. 0 46 123

At 0 46 124
the 0 46 124
end 0 46 124
of 0 46 124
a 0 46 124
long 0 46 124
career 0 46 124
as 0 46 124
Europe’s 0 46 124
leading 0 46 124
“liberal” 0 46 124
Catholic 0 46 124
prelate, 0 46 124
Danneels 0 46 124
came 0 46 124
under 0 46 124
a 0 46 124
cloud 0 46 124
of 0 46 124
scandal 0 46 124
when 0 46 124
he 0 46 124
was 0 46 124
accused 0 46 124
of 0 46 124
having 0 46 124
covered 0 46 124
for 0 46 124
a 0 46 124
protégé 0 46 124
bishop 0 46 124
who 0 46 124
admitted 0 46 124
to 0 46 124
having 0 46 124
sexually 0 46 124
abused 0 46 124
his 0 46 124
own 0 46 124
minor 0 46 124
nephew. 0 46 124

In 0 46 125
2010 0 46 125
the 0 46 125
publication 0 46 125
of 0 46 125
an 0 46 125
audio 0 46 125
recording 0 46 125
determined 0 46 125
undeniably 0 46 125
that 0 46 125
Danneels 0 46 125
had 0 46 125
told 0 46 125
the 0 46 125
victim 0 46 125
to 0 46 125
keep 0 46 125
quiet 0 46 125
and 0 46 125
not 0 46 125
cause 0 46 125
trouble 0 46 125
for 0 46 125
the 0 46 125
soon-to-retire 0 46 125
Bishop 0 46 125
Roger 0 46 125
Vangheluwe 0 46 125
of 0 46 125
Bruges. 0 46 125

The 0 46 126
cardinal 0 46 126
even 0 46 126
went 0 46 126
so 0 46 126
far 0 46 126
as 0 46 126
to 0 46 126
suggest 0 46 126
that 0 46 126
the 0 46 126
victim 0 46 126
should 0 46 126
“ask 0 46 126
forgiveness” 0 46 126
for 0 46 126
his 0 46 126
own 0 46 126
role 0 46 126
in 0 46 126
the 0 46 126
scandal. 0 46 126

Before 0 46 127
the 0 46 127
recordings 0 46 127
were 0 46 127
released, 0 46 127
Danneels 0 46 127
had 0 46 127
also 0 46 127
denied 0 46 127
all 0 46 127
knowledge 0 46 127
of 0 46 127
sexual 0 46 127
abuse 0 46 127
by 0 46 127
clergy 0 46 127
or 0 46 127
cover-ups. 0 46 127

In 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
book, 0 46 128
Colonna 0 46 128
asks 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
question, 0 46 128
“What 1 46 128
happened 1 46 128
to 1 46 128
‘Zero 1 46 128
Tolerance’ 1 46 128
for 1 46 128
clerical 1 46 128
sexual 1 46 128
offenders?” 1 46 128
He 0 46 128
wrote 0 46 128
that 0 46 128
data 0 46 128
presented 0 46 128
by 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
Vatican 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
UN 0 46 128
Human 0 46 128

Commission 0 46 128
in 0 46 128
January 0 46 128
2014 0 46 128
showed 0 46 128
that 0 46 128
Benedict 0 46 128
XVI 0 46 128
“had 0 46 128
defrocked 0 46 128

2009 0 46 128
and 0 46 128
2012,” 0 46 128
including 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
notorious 0 46 128
Fr. 0 46 128

Maciel 0 46 129
Degollado, 0 46 129
founder 0 46 129
of 0 46 129
the 0 46 129
Legionaries 0 46 129
of 0 46 129
Christ. 0 46 129

Crucially, 0 46 130
it 0 46 130
was 0 46 130
Ratzinger 0 46 130
who 0 46 130
moved 0 46 130
the 0 46 130
competence 0 46 130
for 0 46 130
sex 0 46 130
abuse 0 46 130
cases 0 46 130
from 0 46 130
the 0 46 130
Congregation 0 46 130
for 0 46 130
Bishops 0 46 130
to 0 46 130
Doctrine 0 46 130
of 0 46 130
the 0 46 130
Faith, 0 46 130
with 0 46 130
powers 0 46 130
to 0 46 130
suspend 0 46 130
and 0 46 130
punish 0 46 130
offenders. 0 46 130

His 0 46 131
reforms 0 46 131
specifically 0 46 131
included 0 46 131
bishops 0 46 131
who 0 46 131
had 0 46 131
refused 0 46 131
to 0 46 131
act 0 46 131
against 0 46 131
priest-abusers. 0 46 131

A 0 46 132
senior 0 46 132
member 0 46 132
of 0 46 132
the 0 46 132
Vatican’s 0 46 132
diplomatic 0 46 132
corps, 0 46 132
Archbishop 0 46 132
Miguel 0 46 132
Maury 0 46 132
Buendia, 0 46 132
confirmed 0 46 132
this, 0 46 132
saying, 0 46 132
“This 0 46 132
Pope 0 46 132
has 0 46 132
removed 0 46 132
two 0 46 132
or 0 46 132
three 0 46 132
bishops 0 46 132
per 0 46 132
month 0 46 132
throughout 0 46 132
the 0 46 132
world... 0 46 132

There 0 46 133
have 0 46 133
been 0 46 133
two 0 46 133
or 0 46 133
three 0 46 133
instances 0 46 133
in 0 46 133
which 0 46 133
they 0 46 133
said 0 46 133
no, 0 46 133
and 0 46 133
so 0 46 133
the 0 46 133
Pope 0 46 133
simply 0 46 133
removed 0 46 133
them.” 0 46 133

These 0 46 134
reforms 0 46 134
– 0 46 134
and 0 46 134
removals 0 46 134
– 0 46 134
have 0 46 134
ceased 0 46 134
entirely 0 46 134
under 0 46 134
Francis. 0 46 134

Despite 0 46 135
his 0 46 135
claims 0 46 135
that 0 46 135
he 0 46 135
punishes 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
guilty, 0 46 135
it 0 46 135
was 0 46 135
in 0 46 135
fact 0 46 135
Francis 0 46 135
who 0 46 135
reversed 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
previous, 0 46 135
Benedict-era 0 46 135
sentence 0 46 135
against 0 46 135
the 1 46 135
notorious 1 46 135
Italian 1 46 135
priest-pederast 1 46 135
Mario 0 46 135
Inzoli 0 46 135
at 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
request 0 46 135
of 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
now-equally 0 46 135
notorious 0 46 135
Cardinal 0 46 135
Coccopalmerio. 0 46 135

Inzoli 0 46 136
was 0 46 136
found 0 46 136
guilty 0 46 136
in 0 46 136
2012 0 46 136
by 0 46 136
an 0 46 136
ecclesiastical 0 46 136
court 0 46 136
of 0 46 136
abusing 0 46 136
boys 0 46 136
as 0 46 136
young 0 46 136
as 0 46 136
twelve 0 46 136
and 0 46 136
suspended. 0 46 136

Inzoli 0 46 137
had 0 46 137
even 0 46 137
abused 0 46 137
boys 0 46 137
in 0 46 137
the 0 46 137
confessional, 0 46 137
convincing 0 46 137
them 0 46 137
that 0 46 137
the 1 46 137
abuse 1 46 137
was 1 46 137
approved 1 46 137
by 1 46 137
God. 1 46 137

Following 0 46 138
an 0 46 138
appeal 0 46 138
by 0 46 138
Coccopalmerio, 0 46 138
Francis 0 46 138
reduced 0 46 138
the 0 46 138
priest’s 0 46 138
penalty 0 46 138
to 0 46 138
a 0 46 138
“lifetime 0 46 138
of 0 46 138
prayer,” 0 46 138
with 0 46 138
permission 0 46 138
to 0 46 138
say 0 46 138
Mass 0 46 138
privately, 0 46 138
and 0 46 138
a 0 46 138
promise 0 46 138
to 0 46 138
stay 0 46 138
away 0 46 138
from 0 46 138
children. 0 46 138

The 0 46 139
uproar 0 46 139
over 0 46 139
this 0 46 139
caused 0 46 139
the 0 46 139
Italian 0 46 139
prosecutors 0 46 139
to 0 46 139
reopen 0 46 139
the 0 46 139
case 0 46 139
against 0 46 139
the 0 46 139
priest, 0 46 139
and 0 46 139
eventually 0 46 139
Inzoli 0 46 139
went 0 46 139
to 0 46 139
prison 0 46 139
and 0 46 139
was 0 46 139
laicized. 0 46 139

As 0 46 140
for 0 46 140
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0 46 140
procedural 0 46 140
reforms, 0 46 140
rumours 0 46 140
continue 0 46 140
to 0 46 140
circulate 0 46 140
that 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
pope 0 46 140
intends 0 46 140
to 0 46 140
reverse 0 46 140
them 0 46 140
as 0 46 140
well, 0 46 140
placing 0 46 140
competence 0 46 140
back 0 46 140
into 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
hands 0 46 140
of 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
same 0 46 140
dicastery 0 46 140
that 0 46 140
held 0 46 140
it 0 46 140
when 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
scandals 0 46 140
broke 0 46 140
in 0 46 140
2001. 0 46 140

This 0 46 141
has 0 46 141
been 0 46 141
denied 0 46 141
by 0 46 141
Greg 0 46 141
Burke, 0 46 141
but 0 46 141
given 1 46 141
Francis’s 1 46 141
usual 1 46 141
methods, 1 46 141
it’s 1 46 141
anyone’s 1 46 141
guess 1 46 141
who 1 46 141
in 1 46 141
reality 1 46 141
is 1 46 141
actually 1 46 141
dealing 1 46 141
with 1 46 141
these 1 46 141
cases, 1 46 141
if 1 46 141
anyone. 1 46 141

A 0 46 142
tribunal 0 46 142
of 0 46 142
bishops, 0 46 142
requested 0 46 142
by 0 46 142
his 0 46 142
own 0 46 142

abuse 0 46 142
commission, 0 46 142
was 0 46 142
ignored 0 46 142
and 0 46 142
then 0 46 142
Francis 0 46 142
summarily 0 46 142
removed 0 46 142
two 0 46 142

In 0 46 143
fact, 0 46 143
the 0 46 143

on 0 46 143
the 0 46 143

She 0 46 145
resigned 0 46 145
in 0 46 145
2017, 0 46 145
citing 0 46 145
“Vatican 0 46 145

Collins 0 46 145
released 0 46 145
a 0 46 145
damning 0 46 145
statement, 0 46 145
indicating 0 46 145
that 0 46 145
the 0 46 145
commission 0 46 145
had 0 46 145
never 0 46 145
seriously 0 46 145

none 0 46 146
of 0 46 146
the 0 46 146

recommendations 0 46 146
had 0 46 146
been 0 46 146
implemented. 0 46 146

“The 1 46 147
reluctance 1 46 147
of 1 46 147
some 1 46 147
in 1 46 147
the 1 46 147
Vatican 1 46 147

with 1 46 147
the 1 46 147
work 1 46 147
of 1 46 147
a 1 46 147
commission 1 46 147
when 1 46 147
the 1 46 147
purpose 1 46 147
is 1 46 147

As 0 46 148
of 0 46 148
December 0 46 148
last 0 46 148
year, 0 46 148
the 0 46 148

allowed 0 46 148

no 0 46 148

though 0 46 148
it 0 46 148

This 0 46 150
week 0 46 150
Collins 0 46 150
tweeted 0 46 150
her 0 46 150
question 0 46 150
for 0 46 150
Pope 0 46 150
Francis 0 46 150
on 0 46 150
the 0 46 150
Chilean 0 46 150
situation: 0 46 150
“Why 0 46 150
does 0 46 150
the 0 46 150
Pope 0 46 150
not 0 46 150
believe 0 46 150
these 0 46 150
three 0 46 150
men? 0 46 150

They 0 46 151
have 0 46 151
been 0 46 151
consistent 0 46 151
over 0 46 151
years 0 46 151
in 0 46 151
what 0 46 151
they 0 46 151
say. 0 46 151

When 0 46 152
asked 0 46 152
why 0 46 152
he 0 46 152
believes 0 46 152
his 0 46 152
fellow 0 46 152
cleric 0 46 152
and 0 46 152
not 0 46 152
the 0 46 152
survivors 0 46 152
he 0 46 152
can 0 46 152
give 0 46 152
no 0 46 152
good 0 46 152
reason.” 0 46 152

Why 0 46 153
indeed. 0 46 153
