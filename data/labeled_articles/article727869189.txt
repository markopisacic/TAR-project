In 0
a 0
debate, 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Massimo 0
Faggioli 0
discussed 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
legacy 0
and 0
its 0
effect 0
on 0
internal 0
Church 0
controversies. 0

On 0
Wednesday 0
night, 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
columnist 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Villanova 0
professor 0
of 0
theology 0
Massimo 0
Faggioli 0
came 0
together 0
for 0
a 0
debate 0
entitled 0
“Francis 0
@ 0
Five: 0
Assessing 0
the 0
Legacy 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
Five 0
Years 0
after 0
His 0
Election.” 0
As 0
I 0
made 0
my 0
way 0
up 0
to 0
Fordham 0
University, 0
I 0
was 0
excited. 0

Having 0
followed 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Faggioli’s 0
ongoing 0
dialogue 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
I 0
knew 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
for 0
a 0
lively, 0
if 0
predictable, 0
conversation. 0

In 0
his 0
opening 0
remarks, 0
Douthat 0
laid 0
out 0
three 0
criteria 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
evaluate 0
Francis’s 0
papacy 0
thus 0
far: 0
his 0
impact 0
on 0
the 0
public’s 0
perception 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
(a 0
success); 0
his 0
attempts 0
at 0
reforming 0
the 0
Vatican 0
bureaucracy 0
(a 0
disappointment); 0
and 0
his 0
position 0
on 0
“moral-theological 0
controversies,” 0
specifically, 0
communion 0
for 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried 0
(a 0
problem). 0

Faggioli, 0
meanwhile, 0
outlined 0
a 1
genuinely 1
surprising 1
position. 1

Rather 0
than 0
making 0
a 0
straightforward 0
case 0
for 0
why 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
changed 0
the 0
Church 0
for 0
the 0
better, 0
Faggioli 0
rejected 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
evaluating 0
his 0
papacy 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
“continuity” 0
with 0
past 0
popes, 0
since 0
doing 0
so 0
would 0
assume 0
that 0
“Christianity 0
at 0
some 0
point 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

was 0
complete,” 0
which 0
Faggioli 0
does 0
not 0
think 0
is 0
true. 0

While 0
I 0
emphatically 0
disagree 0
with 0
this 0
argument, 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
hand 0
it 0
to 0
Faggioli: 0
From 0
the 0
outset, 0
he 0
made 0
clear 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
planning 0
to 0
debate 0
Douthat 0
on 0
the 0
implications 0
of 0
the 0
Francis 0
papacy. 0

Instead, 0
through 0
a 1
combination 1
of 1
rhetorical 1
tricks 1
and 1
soft-peddled 1
Hegelianism, 1
he 0
would 0
completely 0
redefine 0
the 0
role 0
and 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

During 0
the 0
crux 0
of 0
the 0
debate 0
— 0
the 0
discussion 0
of 0
communion 0
for 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried 0
— 0
Faggioli 0
raised 0
his 1
most 1
theologically 1
unsettling 1
point. 1

To 0
defend 0
his 0
position 0
that 0
remarried 0
persons 0
should 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
receive 0
communion, 0
Faggioli 0
invoked 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Germany, 0
where 0
50 0
percent 0
of 0
Catholic 0
marriages 0
end 0
in 0
divorce. 0

For 1
Faggioli, 1
the 1
implication 1
is 1
that 1
at 1
least 1
50 1
percent 1
of 1
German 1
Catholic 1
children 1
never 1
see 1
their 1
parents 1
receive 1
communion 1
and 1
lose 1
their 1
faith 1
because 1
of 1
it. 1

This, 0
he 0
says, 0
is 0
“bad 1
for 1
evangelization,” 1
and 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
pews 0
full, 0
the 0
Church’s 0
role 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
to 0
deny 0
communion 0
to 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried, 0
but 0
instead 0
to 0
ask, 0
“What 0
can 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
do 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
faithful 0
able 0
to 0
receive 0
sacraments?” 0

Advertisement 0

This 0
is 0
a 1
lovely 1
suggestion, 1
and 0
one 0
that 0
I’m 0
not 0
entirely 0
unsympathetic 0
to. 0

However, 0
the 0
fact 0
remains 0
that 0
Faggioli 0
is 0
suggesting 0
the 0
Church 0
do 0
much 0
more 0
than 0
provide 0
sacraments 0
to 0
the 0
faithful. 0

Just 0
before 0
invoking 0
the 0
German 0
case, 0
Faggioli 0
characterized 0
the 0
country 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
secular 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

But 0
rather 0
than 0
lamenting 0
what 0
secularism 0
has 0
wrought 0
on 0
marital 0
life 0
in 0
Germany, 0
reasserting 0
the 0
Church’s 0
position 0
on 0
marriage, 0
and 0
insisting 0
that 0
the 0
faithful 0
strive 0
to 0
live 0
according 0
to 0
her 0
laws, 0
Faggioli 0
argues 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
ought 0
to 0
bend 0
to 0
the 0
will 0
of 0
secular 0
society. 0

Advertisement 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
clear 0
to 0
anyone, 0
not 0
just 0
practicing 0
Catholics, 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
absurd. 0

If 0
the 0
Church 0
exists 0
simply 0
to 0
accommodate 0
the 0
whims 0
and 0
failures 0
of 0
secular 0
modernity, 0
then 0
what 0
is 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
the 0
Church? 0

Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
has 0
warned 0
against 0
precisely 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
“accommodation” 0
Faggioli 0
is 0
calling 0
for, 0
writing 0
that 0
when 0
“the 0
people 0
cannot 0
cope” 0
with 0
God, 0
they 0
“bring 0
him 0
down 0
into 0
their 0
own 0
world,” 0
and 0
insist 0
that 0
“he 0
must 0
be 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
God 0
that 0
[they 0
need].” 0
In 0
other 0
words, 0
“Man 0
is 0
using 0
God, 0
and, 0
in 0
reality, 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
outwardly 0
discernible, 0
he 0
is 0
placing 0
himself 0
above 0
God.” 0
To 0
fully 0
drive 0
the 0
point 0
home, 0
Benedict 0
equates 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
worship 0
with 0
the 0
Israelites 0
desert 0
worship 0
of 0
the 0
bull 0
calf. 0

Unsurprisingly, 0
this 0
progressive 0
interpretation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
doctrine 0
eventually 0
reveals 0
itself 0
to 0
be 0
rank 1
historicism. 1

Throughout 0
the 0
debate, 0
Faggioli 0
drew 0
out 0
the 0
argument 0
that 0
allowing 0
the 0
remarried 0
to 0
receive 0
communion 0
would 0
not 0
represent 0
a 0
radical 0
change 0
in 0
doctrine 0
but 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel. 0

Eventually, 0
Douthat 0
drew 0
his 0
argument 0
to 0
its 0
logical 0
conclusion 0
with 0
this 0
question: 0
Were 1
priests 1
throughout 1
history 1
in 1
fact 1
misleading 1
their 1
divorced 1
and 1
remarried 1
parishioners 1
by 1
telling 1
them 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
receive 1
communion? 1

After 0
a 0
few 0
seconds’ 0
pause, 0
Faggioli 0
gave 0
the 0
only 0
answer 0
he 0
could: 0
“There 1
are 1
different 1
responses 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
question 1
in 1
different 1
times.” 1

Throughout 0
their 0
conversation, 0
both 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Faggioli 0
repeatedly 0
observed 0
that 0
the 0
debate 0
over 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
the 0
future 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
carried 0
on 0
primarily 0
among 0
Catholic 0
intellectuals, 0
unbeknownst 0
to 0
most 0
of 0
“the 0
flock.” 0

Advertisement 0

It 0
strikes 0
me, 0
however, 0
that 0
everybody 0
— 0
Catholic 0
or 0
not 0
— 0
has 1
a 1
dog 1
in 1
this 1
fight, 1
which 0
is 0
about 0
more 0
than 0
communion 0
and 0
canon 0
law. 0

At 0
its 0
core, 0
this 0
debate 0
is 0
about 0
truth 0
and 0
our 0
ability 0
to 0
judge 0
right 0
from 0
wrong. 0

Could 1
we 1
possibly 1
say, 1
for 1
instance, 1
that 1
it’s 1
impossible 1
to 1
judge 1
the 1
presidency 1
of 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
relative 1
to 1
past 1
presidents? 1

Of 0
course 0
not 0
— 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
preposterous, 0
as 0
I’m 0
sure 0
Faggioli 0
would 0
agree. 0

To 0
pass 0
moral 0
judgements 0
on 0
papacies, 0
presidencies, 0
or 0
anything 0
else, 0
we 0
must 0
have 0
recourse 0
to 0
truth, 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
institutions 0
that 0
have 0
upheld 0
this 0
truth 0
for 0
centuries. 0

Whether 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
or 0
in 0
the 0
academy, 0
we 0
must 0
resist 0
this 0
dangerous 0
historicist 0
impulse. 0

If 1
we 1
don’t, 1
we 1
will 1
find 1
ourselves, 1
in 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
Pope 1
Benedict, 1
in 1
“a 1
dictatorship 1
of 1
relativism 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
recognize 1
anything 1
as 1
definitive 1
and 1
whose 1
ultimate 1
goal 1
consists 1
solely 1
of 1
one’s 1
own 1
ego 1
and 1
desires.” 1
