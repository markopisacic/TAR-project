President 0 49 1
Trump 0 49 1
took 0 49 1
CNN’s 0 49 1
improbable 0 49 1
court 0 49 1
victory 0 49 1
temporarily 0 49 1
restoring 0 49 1
CNN 0 49 1
White 0 49 1
House 0 49 1
correspondent 0 49 1
Jim 0 49 1
Acosta’s 0 49 1
“hard 0 49 1
pass” 0 49 1
media 0 49 1
credential 0 49 1
for 0 49 1
the 0 49 1
executive 0 49 1
mansion 0 49 1
in 0 49 1
stride, 0 49 1
vowing 0 49 1
to 0 49 1
kick 0 49 1
Acosta 0 49 1
out 0 49 1
again 0 49 1
in 0 49 1
the 0 49 1
future 0 49 1
if 0 49 1
he 0 49 1
breaches 0 49 1
White 0 49 1
House 0 49 1
protocol 0 49 1
again. 0 49 1

The 0 49 2
yanking 0 49 2
of 0 49 2
the 0 49 2
physical 0 49 2
credential, 0 49 2
by 0 49 2
the 0 49 2
way, 0 49 2
isn’t 0 49 2
exactly 0 49 2
a 0 49 2
grave 1 49 2
hardship. 1 49 2

It 0 49 3
just 0 49 3
means 0 49 3
Acosta 0 49 3
would 0 49 3
need 0 49 3
to 0 49 3
make 0 49 3
an 0 49 3
appointment 0 49 3
through 0 49 3
the 0 49 3
White 0 49 3
House 0 49 3
press 0 49 3
office 0 49 3
every 0 49 3
time 0 49 3
he 0 49 3
wanted 0 49 3
to 0 49 3
visit 0 49 3
the 0 49 3
White 0 49 3
House 0 49 3
grounds, 0 49 3
just 0 49 3
as 0 49 3
the 0 49 3
rest 0 49 3
of 0 49 3
the 0 49 3
non-hard 0 49 3
pass-holding 0 49 3
journalists 0 49 3
who 0 49 3
don’t 0 49 3
work 0 49 3
for 0 49 3
big 0 49 3
media 0 49 3
outlets 0 49 3
like 0 49 3
CNN 0 49 3
have 0 49 3
to 0 49 3
do. 0 49 3

Lacking 0 49 4
a 0 49 4
hard 0 49 4
pass 0 49 4
does 0 49 4
not 0 49 4
prevent 0 49 4
anyone 0 49 4
from 0 49 4
reporting 0 49 4
on 0 49 4
the 0 49 4
White 0 49 4

Speaking 0 49 5

Chris 0 49 5
Wallace 0 49 5
of 0 49 5
Fox 0 49 5
News 0 49 5
Channel 0 49 5
in 0 49 5
an 0 49 5
interview 0 49 5
that 0 49 5
aired 0 49 5
Sunday, 0 49 5
Trump 0 49 5
had 0 49 5
some 0 49 5
new 0 49 5
ideas 0 49 5
on 0 49 5
how 0 49 5
to 0 49 5
deal 0 49 5
with 0 49 5
Acosta, 0 49 5
who 0 49 5
picks 0 49 5
fights 0 49 5
with 0 49 5
him 0 49 5
during 0 49 5
pressers. 0 49 5

"I 0 49 6
think 0 49 6
one 0 49 6
of 0 49 6
the 0 49 6
things 0 49 6
we’ll 0 49 6
do 0 49 6
is 0 49 6
maybe 0 49 6
turn 0 49 6
the 0 49 6
camera 0 49 6
off 0 49 6
that 0 49 6
faces 0 49 6
them, 0 49 6
because 0 49 6
then 0 49 6
they 0 49 6
don’t 0 49 6
have 0 49 6
any 0 49 6
air 0 49 6
time, 0 49 6
although 0 49 6
I’ll 0 49 6
probably 0 49 6
be 0 49 6
sued 0 49 6
for 0 49 6
that 0 49 6
and 0 49 6
maybe, 0 49 6
you 0 49 6
know, 0 49 6
win 0 49 6
or 0 49 6
lose 0 49 6
it, 0 49 6
who 0 49 6
knows," 0 49 6
Trump 0 49 6
said. 0 49 6

"I 0 49 7
mean, 0 49 7
with 0 49 7
this 0 49 7
stuff 0 49 7
you 0 49 7
never 0 49 7
know 0 49 7
what’s 0 49 7
going 0 49 7
to 0 49 7
happen." 0 49 7

The 0 49 8
president 0 49 8
described 0 49 8
Acosta 0 49 8
as 0 49 8
"unbelievably 1 49 8
rude 1 49 8
to 0 49 8
[White 0 49 8

Sarah 0 49 8
Huckabee, 0 49 8
who’s 0 49 8
a 0 49 8
wonderful 1 49 8
woman," 1 49 8
and 0 49 8
said 0 49 8
his 0 49 8
administration 0 49 8
is 0 49 8
drawing 0 49 8
up 0 49 8
"rules 0 49 8
and 0 49 8
regulations" 0 49 8
for 0 49 8
White 0 49 8
House 0 49 8
reporters. 0 49 8

"And 0 49 9
if 1 49 9
he 1 49 9
misbehaves, 1 49 9
we’ll 1 49 9
throw 1 49 9
him 1 49 9
out 1 49 9
or 1 49 9
we’ll 1 49 9
stop 1 49 9
the 1 49 9
news 1 49 9
conference," 1 49 9
Trump 0 49 9
said. 0 49 9

Acosta’s 0 49 10
hard 0 49 10
pass 0 49 10
was 0 49 10
pulled 0 49 10
after 0 49 10
a 0 49 10
contentious 0 49 10
Nov. 0 49 10
7 0 49 10
press 0 49 10
conference 0 49 10
at 0 49 10
the 0 49 10
White 0 49 10
House. 0 49 10

After 0 49 11
interacting 0 49 11
with 0 49 11
President 0 49 11
Trump 0 49 11
– 0 49 11
Acosta 0 49 11
said 0 49 11
he 0 49 11
wanted 0 49 11
to 0 49 11
“challenge” 0 49 11
him 0 49 11
on 0 49 11
calling 0 49 11
the 0 49 11
Central 0 49 11
American 0 49 11
caravans 0 49 11
an 0 49 11
“invasion” 1 49 11
– 0 49 11
the 0 49 11
president 0 49 11
called 0 49 11
upon 0 49 11
another 0 49 11
reporter 0 49 11
to 0 49 11
speak. 0 49 11

After 0 49 12
lecturing 0 49 12
Trump, 0 49 12
Acosta 0 49 12
belligerently 1 49 12
refused 0 49 12
to 0 49 12
yield 0 49 12
the 0 49 12
microphone 0 49 12
to 0 49 12
a 0 49 12
White 0 49 12
House 0 49 12
staffer 0 49 12
and 0 49 12
pushed 0 49 12
her 0 49 12
arm 0 49 12
away 0 49 12
as 0 49 12
she 0 49 12
reached 0 49 12
for 0 49 12
the 0 49 12
device, 0 49 12
all 0 49 12
of 0 49 12
which 0 49 12
was 0 49 12
captured 0 49 12
on 0 49 12
video. 0 49 12

On 0 49 13
Nov. 0 49 13
16, 0 49 13
U.S. 0 49 13
District 0 49 13
Judge 0 49 13
Timothy 0 49 13
J. 0 49 13
Kelly 0 49 13
of 0 49 13
Washington, 0 49 13
D.C., 0 49 13
who 0 49 13
was 0 49 13
appointed 0 49 13
by 0 49 13
Trump, 0 49 13
ruled 0 49 13
against 0 49 13
the 0 49 13
administration 0 49 13
and 0 49 13
ordered 0 49 13
Acosta’s 0 49 13
hard 0 49 13
pass 0 49 13
restored 0 49 13
for 0 49 13
14 0 49 13
days, 0 49 13
pending 0 49 13
further 0 49 13
hearings 0 49 13
in 0 49 13
the 0 49 13
lawsuit. 0 49 13

But 0 49 14
it 0 49 14
was 0 49 14
not 0 49 14
a 0 49 14
vindication 0 49 14
of 0 49 14
Acosta’s 0 49 14
free 0 49 14
speech 0 49 14
rights 0 49 14
under 0 49 14
the 0 49 14
First 0 49 14
Amendment. 0 49 14

The 0 49 15
judge 0 49 15
specifically 0 49 15
said 0 49 15
that 0 49 15
the 0 49 15
First 0 49 15
Amendment 0 49 15
claim 0 49 15
made 0 49 15
by 0 49 15
Acosta 0 49 15
and 0 49 15
CNN 0 49 15
had 0 49 15
not 0 49 15
yet 0 49 15
been 0 49 15
adjudicated 0 49 15
and 0 49 15
added 0 49 15
that 0 49 15
the 0 49 15
president 0 49 15
was 0 49 15
free 0 49 15
not 0 49 15
to 0 49 15
call 0 49 15
on 0 49 15
Acosta 0 49 15
at 0 49 15
future 0 49 15
press 0 49 15
conferences. 0 49 15

The 0 49 16
temporary 0 49 16
restraining 0 49 16
order 0 49 16
was 0 49 16
nowhere 0 49 16
to 0 49 16
be 0 49 16
found 0 49 16
online 0 49 16
at 0 49 16
press 0 49 16
time, 0 49 16
but 0 49 16
according 0 49 16
to 0 49 16
media 0 49 16
reports, 0 49 16
Kelly 0 49 16
found 0 49 16
that 0 49 16
the 0 49 16
administration 0 49 16
violated 0 49 16
Acosta’s 0 49 16
due 0 49 16
process 0 49 16
rights 0 49 16
under 0 49 16
the 0 49 16
Fifth 0 49 16
Amendment 0 49 16
to 0 49 16
the 0 49 16
Constitution. 0 49 16

The 0 49 17
White 0 49 17
House 0 49 17
vowed 0 49 17
to 0 49 17
remedy 0 49 17
the 0 49 17
situation 0 49 17
by 0 49 17
drawing 0 49 17
up 0 49 17
rules 0 49 17
governing 0 49 17
press 0 49 17
conferences. 0 49 17

The 0 49 18
U.S. 0 49 18
Department 0 49 18
of 0 49 18
Justice 0 49 18
said 0 49 18
the 0 49 18
court 0 49 18
ruling 0 49 18
was 0 49 18
disappointing. 1 49 18

“The 0 49 19
President 0 49 19
has 0 49 19
broad 0 49 19
authority 0 49 19
to 0 49 19
regulate 0 49 19
access 0 49 19
to 0 49 19
the 0 49 19

Acosta 0 49 21
ignorantly 1 49 21
blathered 1 49 21
on 0 49 21
to 0 49 21
reporters 0 49 21
when 0 49 21
he 0 49 21
returned 0 49 21
to 0 49 21
the 0 49 21
White 0 49 21
House 0 49 21
Friday 0 49 21
after 0 49 21
the 0 49 21
court 0 49 21
ruling, 0 49 21
incorrectly 0 49 21
claiming 0 49 21
he 0 49 21
won 0 49 21
a 1 49 21
great 1 49 21

today," 0 49 22

"I'm 0 49 23

all 0 49 23

this." 0 49 23

"This 0 49 24
was 0 49 24
a 0 49 24

think 0 49 24

The 0 49 27
court 0 49 27

isn’t 0 49 27

according 0 49 29
to 0 49 29

According 0 49 30
to 0 49 30
CNN, 0 49 30
“White 0 49 30

of 0 49 31
the 0 49 31
