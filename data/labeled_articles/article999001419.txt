Trump 0
Vows 0
to 0
Kick 0
CNN’s 0
Acosta 0
Out 0
Again 0

President 0
Trump 0
took 0
CNN’s 0
improbable 0
court 0
victory 0
temporarily 0
restoring 0
CNN 0
White 0
House 0
correspondent 0
Jim 0
Acosta’s 0
“hard 0
pass” 0
media 0
credential 0
for 0
the 0
executive 0
mansion 0
in 0
stride, 0
vowing 0
to 0
kick 0
Acosta 0
out 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
if 0
he 0
breaches 0
White 0
House 0
protocol 0
again. 0

The 0
yanking 0
of 0
the 0
physical 0
credential, 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
isn’t 0
exactly 0
a 0
grave 1
hardship. 1

It 0
just 0
means 0
Acosta 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
an 0
appointment 0
through 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
office 0
every 0
time 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
grounds, 0
just 0
as 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
non-hard 0
pass-holding 0
journalists 0
who 0
don’t 0
work 0
for 0
big 0
media 0
outlets 0
like 0
CNN 0
have 0
to 0
do. 0

Lacking 0
a 0
hard 0
pass 0
does 0
not 0
prevent 0
anyone 0
from 0
reporting 0
on 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Speaking 0
to 0
Chris 0
Wallace 0
of 0
Fox 0
News 0
Channel 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Sunday, 0
Trump 0
had 0
some 0
new 0
ideas 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
Acosta, 0
who 0
picks 0
fights 0
with 0
him 0
during 0
pressers. 0

"I 0
think 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
we’ll 0
do 0
is 0
maybe 0
turn 0
the 0
camera 0
off 0
that 0
faces 0
them, 0
because 0
then 0
they 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
air 0
time, 0
although 0
I’ll 0
probably 0
be 0
sued 0
for 0
that 0
and 0
maybe, 0
you 0
know, 0
win 0
or 0
lose 0
it, 0
who 0
knows," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"I 0
mean, 0
with 0
this 0
stuff 0
you 0
never 0
know 0
what’s 0
going 0
to 0
happen." 0

The 0
president 0
described 0
Acosta 0
as 0
"unbelievably 1
rude 1
to 0
[White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary] 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee, 0
who’s 0
a 0
wonderful 1
woman," 1
and 0
said 0
his 0
administration 0
is 0
drawing 0
up 0
"rules 0
and 0
regulations" 0
for 0
White 0
House 0
reporters. 0

"And 0
if 1
he 1
misbehaves, 1
we’ll 1
throw 1
him 1
out 1
or 1
we’ll 1
stop 1
the 1
news 1
conference," 1
Trump 0
said. 0

Acosta’s 0
hard 0
pass 0
was 0
pulled 0
after 0
a 0
contentious 0
Nov. 0
7 0
press 0
conference 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

After 0
interacting 0
with 0
President 0
Trump 0
– 0
Acosta 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
“challenge” 0
him 0
on 0
calling 0
the 0
Central 0
American 0
caravans 0
an 0
“invasion” 1
– 0
the 0
president 0
called 0
upon 0
another 0
reporter 0
to 0
speak. 0

After 0
lecturing 0
Trump, 0
Acosta 0
belligerently 1
refused 0
to 0
yield 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
staffer 0
and 0
pushed 0
her 0
arm 0
away 0
as 0
she 0
reached 0
for 0
the 0
device, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
was 0
captured 0
on 0
video. 0

On 0
Nov. 0
16, 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Judge 0
Timothy 0
J. 0
Kelly 0
of 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
by 0
Trump, 0
ruled 0
against 0
the 0
administration 0
and 0
ordered 0
Acosta’s 0
hard 0
pass 0
restored 0
for 0
14 0
days, 0
pending 0
further 0
hearings 0
in 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

But 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
vindication 0
of 0
Acosta’s 0
free 0
speech 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

The 0
judge 0
specifically 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
claim 0
made 0
by 0
Acosta 0
and 0
CNN 0
had 0
not 0
yet 0
been 0
adjudicated 0
and 0
added 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
free 0
not 0
to 0
call 0
on 0
Acosta 0
at 0
future 0
press 0
conferences. 0

The 0
temporary 0
restraining 0
order 0
was 0
nowhere 0
to 0
be 0
found 0
online 0
at 0
press 0
time, 0
but 0
according 0
to 0
media 0
reports, 0
Kelly 0
found 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
violated 0
Acosta’s 0
due 0
process 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
to 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
vowed 0
to 0
remedy 0
the 0
situation 0
by 0
drawing 0
up 0
rules 0
governing 0
press 0
conferences. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
said 0
the 0
court 0
ruling 0
was 0
disappointing. 1

“The 0
President 0
has 0
broad 0
authority 0
to 0
regulate 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House, 0
including 0
to 0
ensure 0
fair 0
and 0
orderly 0
White 0
House 0
events 0
and 0
press 0
conferences. 0

We 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
continuing 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
lawful 1
actions." 0

Acosta 0
ignorantly 1
blathered 1
on 0
to 0
reporters 0
when 0
he 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Friday 0
after 0
the 0
court 0
ruling, 0
incorrectly 0
claiming 0
he 0
won 0
a 1
great 1
First 1
Amendment 1
victory. 1

"I'm 0
very 0
grateful 0
for 0
what 0
happened 0
today," 0
Acosta 0
said. 0

"I'm 0
grateful 0
for 0
my 0
colleagues 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
who 0
stood 0
by 0
us 0
through 0
all 0
of 0
this." 0

"This 0
was 0
a 0
test 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
we 0
passed 0
the 0
test," 0
he 0
said. 0

"Journalists 0
need 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
their 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
of 0
freedom 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
are 0
sacred, 0
they're 0
protected 0
in 0
our 1
Constitution," 1
Acosta 0
said. 0

"Throughout 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
I 0
was 0
confident 0
and 0
I 0
thought 0
that 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
result 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
that 0
our 0
rights 0
would 0
be 0
protected 0
as 0
we 0
continue 0
to 0
cover 0
our 0
government 0
and 0
hold 0
our 0
leaders 0
accountable." 0

The 0
court 0
case 0
isn’t 0
over 0
yet. 0

The 0
legal 0
antagonists 0
have 0
to 0
report 0
to 0
the 0
court 0
Monday 0
afternoon. 0

The 0
court 0
ordered 0
the 0
parties 0
to 0
“file 0
a 0
joint 0
status 0
report 0
proposing 0
how 0
they 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
proceed 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
by 0
3:00 0
p.m. 0
on 0
November 0
19, 0
2018[,]” 0
according 0
to 0
its 0
online 0
docket. 0

According 0
to 0
CNN, 0
“White 0
House 0
officials 0
sent 0
Acosta 0
a 0
letter 0
stating 0
that 0
his 0
pass 0
is 0
set 0
to 0
be 0
suspended 0
again 0
once 0
the 0
restraining 0
order 0
expires.” 0

From 0
the 0
looks 0
of 0
the 0
letter, 0
the 0
W.H. 0

is 0
trying 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
paper 0
trail 0
that 0
will 0
empower 0
the 0
administration 0
to 0
boot 0
Acosta 0
again 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
month. 0

CNN 0
responded 0
with 0
this 0
statement 0
on 0
Sunday: 0
"The 0
White 0
House 0
is 0
continuing 0
to 0
violate 0
the 0
First 0
and 0
5th 0
Amendments 0
of 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

These 0
actions 0
threaten 0
all 0
journalists 0
and 0
news 0
organizations. 0

Jim 0
Acosta 0
and 0
CNN 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
report 0
the 0
news 0
about 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
and 0
the 0
President." 0

The 0
Acosta-CNN 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
filed 0
by 0
Ted 0
Boutrous 0
and 0
Trump-hating 1
Republican 1
lawyer 0
Ted 0
Olson, 0
of 0
the 0
law 0
firm 0
Gibson, 0
Dunn, 0
and 0
Crutcher. 0

Olson 0
was 0
solicitor 0
general 0
in 0
President 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush’s 0
administration. 0

(The 0
legal 0
complaint 0
may 0

Boutrous 0
said 0
CNN 0
is 0
prepared 0
to 0
dig 0
in 0
for 0
a 0
protracted 0
legal 0
fight 0
if 0
it 0
needs 0
to. 0

"We're 0
ready 0
to 0
litigate 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
we 0
have 0
to, 0
to 0
protect 0
