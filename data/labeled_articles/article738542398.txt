IN 0
MAY 0
2013, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
Greg 0
Miller 0

as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“a 0

shake-up” 0
by 0
then-Director 0
John 0

As 0
Miller 0
documented, 0
this 0
official 0
— 0
whom 0

in 0
the 1
worst 1

As 0
Miller 0
put 0
it, 0

program” 0

had 0
an 0
“extensive 0
role” 0
in 0

Even 0
more 0
troubling, 0
she 0
“had 0
run 0
a 0
secret 0
prison 0
in 0
Thailand” 0
— 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
network 0
of 0
“black 0
sites” 0
— 0
“where 0
two 0
detainees 0
were 0
subjected 0
to 0
waterboarding 0
and 0
other 0
harsh 1
techniques.” 1
The 0

Abu 0
Zubaydah. 0

all 0
that, 0
she 0

role 0
in 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
interrogation 0
videotapes 0
that 0

the 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
both 0
at 0
the 0
black 0
site 0
she 0
ran 0
and 0
other 0
secret 0
agency 0
locations. 0

9/11 0
commission 0
and 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0

was 0
condemned 0
as 0
“obstruction” 0
by 0
commission 0
chairs 0
