2013, 0 250 4
the 0 250 4
Washington 0 250 4
Post’s 0 250 4
Greg 0 250 4
Miller 0 250 4
reported 0 250 4
that 0 250 4
the 0 250 4
head 0 250 4
of 0 250 4
the 0 250 4
CIA’s 0 250 4
clandestine 0 250 4
service 0 250 4
was 0 250 4
being 0 250 4
shifted 0 250 4
out 0 250 4
of 0 250 4
that 0 250 4
position 0 250 4
as 0 250 4
a 0 250 4
result 0 250 4
of 0 250 4
“a 0 250 4
management 0 250 4
shake-up” 0 250 4
by 0 250 4
then-Director 0 250 4
John 0 250 4
Brennan. 0 250 4

As 0 250 5
Miller 0 250 5
documented, 0 250 5
this 0 250 5
official 0 250 5
— 0 250 5
whom 0 250 5
the 0 250 5
paper 0 250 5
did 0 250 5
not 0 250 5
name 0 250 5
because 0 250 5
she 0 250 5
was 0 250 5
a 0 250 5
covert 0 250 5
agent 0 250 5
at 0 250 5
the 0 250 5
time 0 250 5
— 0 250 5
was 0 250 5
centrally 0 250 5
involved 0 250 5
in 0 250 5
the 1 250 5
worst 1 250 5
abuses 1 250 5
of 1 250 5
the 1 250 5
CIA’s 1 250 5
Bush-era 1 250 5
torture 1 250 5
regime. 1 250 5

As 0 250 6
Miller 0 250 6
put 0 250 6
it, 0 250 6
she 0 250 6
was 0 250 6
“directly 0 250 6
involved 0 250 6
in 0 250 6
its 0 250 6
controversial 0 250 6
interrogation 0 250 6
program” 0 250 6
and 0 250 6
had 0 250 6
an 0 250 6
“extensive 0 250 6
role” 0 250 6
in 0 250 6
torturing 0 250 6
detainees. 0 250 6

Even 0 250 7
more 0 250 7
troubling, 0 250 7
she 0 250 7
“had 0 250 7
run 0 250 7
a 0 250 7
secret 0 250 7
prison 0 250 7
in 0 250 7
Thailand” 0 250 7
— 0 250 7
part 0 250 7
of 0 250 7
the 0 250 7
CIA’s 0 250 7
network 0 250 7
of 0 250 7
“black 0 250 7
sites” 0 250 7
— 0 250 7
“where 0 250 7
two 0 250 7
detainees 0 250 7
were 0 250 7
subjected 0 250 7
to 0 250 7
waterboarding 0 250 7
and 0 250 7
other 0 250 7
harsh 1 250 7
techniques.” 1 250 7

on 0 250 7
torture 0 250 7
also 0 250 7
detailed 0 250 7
the 0 250 7
central 0 250 7
role 0 250 7
she 0 250 7
played 0 250 7
in 0 250 7
the 0 250 7

gruesome 1 250 7
torture 1 250 7
of 0 250 7

Abu 0 250 7
Zubaydah. 0 250 7

Beyond 0 250 8
all 0 250 8
that, 0 250 8
she 0 250 8
played 0 250 8
a 0 250 8
vital 0 250 8
role 0 250 8
in 0 250 8
the 0 250 8
destruction 0 250 8
