Here 0 215 21

Abraham’s 0 215 21
account… 0 215 21

“And 0 215 22
the 0 215 22
men 0 215 22
rose 0 215 22
up 0 215 22
from 0 215 22
thence, 0 215 22
and 0 215 22
looked 0 215 22
toward 0 215 22
Sodom: 0 215 22
and 0 215 22
Abraham 0 215 22
went 0 215 22
with 0 215 22
them 0 215 22
to 0 215 22
bring 0 215 22
them 0 215 22
on 0 215 22
the 0 215 22
way. 0 215 22

And 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
Lord 0 215 23
said, 0 215 23
Shall 0 215 23
I 0 215 23
hide 0 215 23
from 0 215 23
Abraham 0 215 23
that 0 215 23
thing 0 215 23
which 0 215 23
I 0 215 23
do; 0 215 23
Seeing 0 215 23
that 0 215 23
Abraham 0 215 23
shall 0 215 23
surely 0 215 23
become 0 215 23
a 0 215 23
great 0 215 23

mighty 0 215 23
nation, 0 215 23

the 0 215 23
nations 0 215 23
of 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
earth 0 215 23

For 0 215 24
I 0 215 24
know 0 215 24
him, 0 215 24
that 0 215 24
he 0 215 24
will 0 215 24
command 0 215 24
his 0 215 24
children 0 215 24

household 0 215 24
after 0 215 24
him, 0 215 24
and 0 215 24
they 0 215 24
shall 0 215 24
keep 0 215 24
the 0 215 24
way 0 215 24
of 0 215 24
the 0 215 24
Lord, 0 215 24
to 0 215 24
do 0 215 24
justice 0 215 24
and 0 215 24
judgment; 0 215 24
that 0 215 24
the 0 215 24
Lord 0 215 24
may 0 215 24
bring 0 215 24
upon 0 215 24
Abraham 0 215 24
that 0 215 24
which 0 215 24
he 0 215 24
hath 0 215 24
spoken 0 215 24
of 0 215 24
him. 0 215 24

And 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
Lord 0 215 25
said, 0 215 25
Because 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
cry 0 215 25
of 0 215 25
Sodom 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
Gomorrah 0 215 25
is 0 215 25
great, 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
because 0 215 25
their 0 215 25
sin 0 215 25
is 0 215 25
very 0 215 25
grievous; 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
will 0 215 25
go 0 215 25
down 0 215 25
now, 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
see 0 215 25
whether 0 215 25
they 0 215 25
have 0 215 25
done 0 215 25
altogether 0 215 25
according 0 215 25
to 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
cry 0 215 25
of 0 215 25
it, 0 215 25
which 0 215 25
is 0 215 25
come 0 215 25
unto 0 215 25
me; 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
if 0 215 25
not, 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
will 0 215 25
know. 0 215 25

And 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
men 0 215 26
turned 0 215 26
their 0 215 26
faces 0 215 26
from 0 215 26
thence, 0 215 26
and 0 215 26
went 0 215 26
toward 0 215 26
Sodom: 0 215 26
but 0 215 26
Abraham 0 215 26
stood 0 215 26
yet 0 215 26
before 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
Lord. 0 215 26

And 0 215 27
Abraham 0 215 27
drew 0 215 27
near, 0 215 27
and 0 215 27
said, 0 215 27
Wilt 0 215 27
thou 0 215 27
also 0 215 27
destroy 0 215 27
the 1 215 27
righteous 1 215 27
with 0 215 27
the 1 215 27
wicked? 1 215 27

Peradventure 0 215 28
there 0 215 28
be 0 215 28
fifty 0 215 28
righteous 1 215 28
within 0 215 28
the 0 215 28
city: 0 215 28
wilt 0 215 28
thou 0 215 28
also 0 215 28
destroy 0 215 28
and 0 215 28
not 0 215 28
spare 0 215 28
the 0 215 28
place 0 215 28
for 0 215 28
the 0 215 28
fifty 0 215 28
righteous 1 215 28
that 0 215 28
are 0 215 28
therein? 0 215 28

That 0 215 29
be 0 215 29
far 0 215 29
from 0 215 29
thee 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
do 0 215 29
after 0 215 29
this 0 215 29
manner, 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
slay 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
righteous 1 215 29
with 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
wicked: 1 215 29
and 0 215 29
that 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
righteous 1 215 29
should 0 215 29
be 0 215 29
as 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
wicked, 1 215 29
that 0 215 29
be 0 215 29
far 0 215 29
from 0 215 29
thee: 0 215 29
Shall 0 215 29
not 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
Judge 0 215 29
of 0 215 29
all 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
earth 0 215 29
do 0 215 29
right? 0 215 29

And 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
Lord 0 215 30
said, 0 215 30
If 0 215 30
I 0 215 30
find 0 215 30
in 0 215 30
Sodom 0 215 30
fifty 0 215 30
righteous 1 215 30
within 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
city, 0 215 30
then 0 215 30
I 0 215 30
will 0 215 30
spare 0 215 30
all 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
place 0 215 30
for 0 215 30
their 0 215 30
sakes. 0 215 30

And 0 215 31
Abraham 0 215 31
answered 0 215 31
and 0 215 31
said, 0 215 31
Behold 0 215 31
now, 0 215 31
I 0 215 31
have 0 215 31
taken 0 215 31
upon 0 215 31
me 0 215 31
to 0 215 31
speak 0 215 31
unto 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
Lord, 0 215 31
which 0 215 31
am 0 215 31
but 0 215 31
dust 0 215 31
and 0 215 31
ashes: 0 215 31
Peradventure 0 215 31
there 0 215 31
shall 0 215 31
lack 0 215 31
five 0 215 31
of 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
fifty 0 215 31
righteous: 1 215 31
wilt 0 215 31
thou 0 215 31
destroy 0 215 31
all 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
city 0 215 31
for 0 215 31
lack 0 215 31
of 0 215 31
five? 0 215 31

And 0 215 32
he 0 215 32
said, 0 215 32
If 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
find 0 215 32
there 0 215 32
forty 0 215 32
and 0 215 32
five, 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
will 0 215 32
not 0 215 32
destroy 0 215 32
it. 0 215 32

And 0 215 33
he 0 215 33
spake 0 215 33
unto 0 215 33
him 0 215 33
yet 0 215 33
again, 0 215 33
and 0 215 33
said, 0 215 33
Peradventure 0 215 33
there 0 215 33
shall 0 215 33
be 0 215 33
forty 0 215 33
found 0 215 33
there. 0 215 33

And 0 215 34
he 0 215 34
said, 0 215 34
I 0 215 34
will 0 215 34
not 0 215 34
do 0 215 34
it 0 215 34
for 0 215 34
forty's 0 215 34
sake. 0 215 34

And 0 215 35
he 0 215 35
said 0 215 35
unto 0 215 35
him, 0 215 35
Oh 0 215 35
let 0 215 35
not 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
Lord 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
angry, 0 215 35
and 0 215 35
I 0 215 35
will 0 215 35
speak: 0 215 35
Peradventure 0 215 35
there 0 215 35
shall 0 215 35
thirty 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
found 0 215 35
there. 0 215 35

And 0 215 36
he 0 215 36
said, 0 215 36

it, 0 215 36
if 0 215 36
I 0 215 36
find 0 215 36
thirty 0 215 36
there. 0 215 36

And 0 215 37
he 0 215 37
said, 0 215 37
Behold 0 215 37
now, 0 215 37
I 0 215 37
have 0 215 37
taken 0 215 37
upon 0 215 37

Peradventure 0 215 37

shall 0 215 37

twenty 0 215 37

there. 0 215 37

And 0 215 38
he 0 215 38
said, 0 215 38
I 0 215 38
will 0 215 38
not 0 215 38
destroy 0 215 38
it 0 215 38
for 0 215 38
twenty's 0 215 38
sake. 0 215 38

And 0 215 39
he 0 215 39
said, 0 215 39
Oh 0 215 39
let 0 215 39
not 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
Lord 0 215 39
be 0 215 39
angry, 0 215 39
and 0 215 39
I 0 215 39
will 0 215 39
speak 0 215 39
yet 0 215 39
but 0 215 39
this 0 215 39
once: 0 215 39
Peradventure 0 215 39
ten 0 215 39
shall 0 215 39

I 0 215 40

destroy 0 215 40
it 0 215 40
for 0 215 40
ten's 0 215 40
sake. 0 215 40

And 0 215 41
the 0 215 41
Lord 0 215 41
went 0 215 41
his 0 215 41
way, 0 215 41
as 0 215 41

the 0 215 44
two 0 215 44
angels, 0 215 44
disguised 0 215 44
as 0 215 44
human 0 215 44

visiting 0 215 44
Sodom 0 215 44

Lot 0 215 45
met 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
angels 0 215 45
in 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
city 0 215 45

urged 0 215 45
them 0 215 45
to 0 215 45
stay 0 215 45
at 0 215 45
his 0 215 45
house. 0 215 45

The 0 215 46
angels 0 215 46
agreed. 0 215 46

The 0 215 47
Bible 0 215 47
then 0 215 47
informs 0 215 47
us, 0 215 47
"Before 0 215 47
they 0 215 47
had 0 215 47
gone 0 215 47
to 0 215 47

all 0 215 47
the 0 215 47

wrath 0 215 50
that 0 215 50
God 0 215 50
was 0 215 50
about 0 215 50

Lot 0 215 51
and 0 215 51
his 0 215 51
family 0 215 51
flee 0 215 51
the 0 215 51
city, 0 215 51
and 0 215 51
then 0 215 51
"the 1 215 51
LORD 1 215 51

down 1 215 51

all 0 215 52
those 0 215 52
living 0 215 52
in 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
cities..." 0 215 52
(Genesis 0 215 52
19:2 0 215 52
4) 0 215 52
. 0 215 52

In 0 215 53
light 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
passage, 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
most 0 215 53
common 0 215 53
response 0 215 53
to 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
question, 0 215 53
"What 0 215 53
was 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
sin 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
Sodom 0 215 53
and 0 215 53
Gomorrah?" 0 215 53

is 0 215 54
that 0 215 54
it 0 215 54
was 0 215 54
homosexuality. 0 215 54

That 0 215 55
is 0 215 55
how 0 215 55
the 0 215 55
term 0 215 55
”sodomy” 0 215 55
came 0 215 55
to 0 215 55
be 0 215 55
used 0 215 55
to 0 215 55
refer 0 215 55
to 0 215 55
anal 0 215 55
sex 0 215 55
between 0 215 55
two 0 215 55
men, 0 215 55
whether 0 215 55
consensual 0 215 55
or 0 215 55
forced. 0 215 55

Clearly, 0 215 56
homosexuality 0 215 56
was 0 215 56
part 0 215 56
of 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
reason 0 215 56
God 0 215 56
destroyed 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
two 0 215 56
cities. 0 215 56

The 0 215 57
men 0 215 57
of 0 215 57
Sodom 0 215 57
and 0 215 57
Gomorrah 0 215 57
wanted 1 215 57
to 1 215 57
perform 1 215 57
homosexual 1 215 57
gang 1 215 57
rape 1 215 57
on 1 215 57
the 1 215 57
two 1 215 57
angels, 1 215 57
who 0 215 57
were 0 215 57
disguised 0 215 57
as 0 215 57
men. 0 215 57

At 0 215 58
the 0 215 58
same 0 215 58
time, 0 215 58
it 0 215 58
is 0 215 58
not 0 215 58
biblical 0 215 58
to 0 215 58
say 0 215 58
that 0 215 58
homosexuality 0 215 58
was 0 215 58
the 0 215 58
exclusive 0 215 58
reason 0 215 58
why 0 215 58
God 0 215 58
destroyed 0 215 58
Sodom 0 215 58
and 0 215 58
Gomorrah. 0 215 58

The 0 215 59
cities 0 215 59
of 0 215 59
Sodom 0 215 59
and 0 215 59
Gomorrah 0 215 59
were 0 215 59
definitely 0 215 59
not 0 215 59
exclusive 0 215 59
in 0 215 59
terms 0 215 59
of 0 215 59
the 0 215 59
sins 0 215 59
in 0 215 59
which 0 215 59
they 0 215 59
indulged. 0 215 59

Ezekiel 0 215 60
16:49-50 0 215 60
declares, 0 215 60
"Now 0 215 60
this 0 215 60
was 0 215 60
the 0 215 60
sin 0 215 60
of 0 215 60
your 0 215 60
sister 0 215 60
Sodom: 0 215 60
She 1 215 60
and 1 215 60
her 1 215 60
daughters 1 215 60
were 1 215 60
arrogant, 1 215 60
overfed 1 215 60
and 1 215 60
unconcerned; 1 215 60
they 1 215 60
did 1 215 60
not 1 215 60
help 1 215 60
the 1 215 60
poor 1 215 60
and 1 215 60
needy. 1 215 60

They 1 215 61
were 1 215 61
haughty 1 215 61
and 1 215 61
did 1 215 61
detestable 1 215 61
things 1 215 61
before 1 215 61
me..." 0 215 61
The 0 215 61
Hebrew 0 215 61
word 0 215 61
translated 0 215 61
"detestable" 0 215 61
refers 0 215 61
to 0 215 61
something 0 215 61
that 0 215 61
is 0 215 61
morally 1 215 61
disgusting 1 215 61
and 0 215 61
is 0 215 61
the 0 215 61
exact 0 215 61
same 0 215 61
word 0 215 61
used 0 215 61
in 0 215 61
Leviticus 0 215 61
18:22 0 215 61
that 0 215 61
refers 0 215 61
to 0 215 61
homosexuality 0 215 61
as 0 215 61
an 0 215 61
"abomination." 1 215 61

Similarly, 0 215 62
Jude 0 215 62
7 0 215 62
declares, 0 215 62
"...Sodom 0 215 62
and 0 215 62
Gomorrah 0 215 62
and 0 215 62
the 0 215 62
surrounding 0 215 62
towns 0 215 62
gave 1 215 62
themselves 1 215 62
up 1 215 62
to 1 215 62
sexual 1 215 62
immorality 1 215 62
and 1 215 62
perversion." 1 215 62

So, 0 215 63
again, 0 215 63
while 0 215 63
homosexuality 0 215 63
was 0 215 63
not 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
only 0 215 63
sin 0 215 63
in 0 215 63
which 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
cities 0 215 63
of 0 215 63
Sodom 0 215 63
and 0 215 63
Gomorrah 0 215 63
indulged, 0 215 63
it 0 215 63
does 0 215 63
appear 0 215 63
to 0 215 63
be 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
primary 0 215 63
reason 0 215 63
for 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
destruction 0 215 63
of 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
cities. 0 215 63

Those 0 215 64
who 0 215 64
attempt 0 215 64
to 0 215 64
explain 0 215 64
away 0 215 64
the 0 215 64
biblical 0 215 64
condemnations 0 215 64
of 0 215 64
homosexuality 0 215 64
claim 0 215 64
that 0 215 64
the 0 215 64
sin 0 215 64
of 0 215 64
Sodom 0 215 64
and 0 215 64
Gomorrah 0 215 64
was 0 215 64
inhospitality. 0 215 64

The 0 215 65
men 0 215 65
of 0 215 65
Sodom 0 215 65
and 0 215 65
Gomorrah 0 215 65
were 0 215 65
certainly 0 215 65
being 0 215 65
inhospitable. 0 215 65

There 1 215 66
is 1 215 66
probably 1 215 66
nothing 1 215 66
more 1 215 66
inhospitable 1 215 66
than 1 215 66
homosexual 1 215 66
gang 1 215 66
rape. 1 215 66

But 0 215 67
to 0 215 67
say 0 215 67
God 0 215 67
completely 0 215 67
destroyed 0 215 67
two 0 215 67
cities 0 215 67
and 0 215 67
all 0 215 67
their 0 215 67
inhabitants 0 215 67
for 0 215 67
being 0 215 67
inhospitable 0 215 67
clearly 0 215 67
misses 0 215 67
the 0 215 67
point. 0 215 67

While 0 215 68
Sodom 0 215 68
and 0 215 68
Gomorrah 0 215 68
were 0 215 68
guilty 0 215 68
of 0 215 68
many 0 215 68
other 0 215 68
horrendous 1 215 68
sins, 1 215 68
homosexuality 1 215 68
was 1 215 68
the 1 215 68
reason 1 215 68
God 1 215 68
poured 1 215 68
fiery 1 215 68
sulfur 1 215 68
on 1 215 68
the 1 215 68
cities, 1 215 68
completely 1 215 68
destroying 1 215 68
them 1 215 68
and 1 215 68
all 1 215 68
of 1 215 68
their 1 215 68
inhabitants. 1 215 68

To 0 215 69
this 0 215 69
day, 0 215 69
the 0 215 69
area 0 215 69
where 0 215 69
Sodom 0 215 69
and 0 215 69
Gomorrah 0 215 69
were 0 215 69
located 0 215 69
remains 0 215 69
a 0 215 69
desolate 0 215 69
wasteland. 0 215 69

Sodom 1 215 70
and 1 215 70
Gomorrah 1 215 70
serve 1 215 70
as 1 215 70
a 1 215 70
powerful 1 215 70
example 1 215 70
of 1 215 70
how 1 215 70
God 1 215 70
feels 1 215 70
about 1 215 70
sin 1 215 70
in 1 215 70
general, 1 215 70
and 1 215 70
homosexuality 1 215 70
specifically. 1 215 70

The 0 215 71
point 0 215 71
is 0 215 71
that 0 215 71
there 0 215 71
were 0 215 71
no 0 215 71
righteous 1 215 71
to 0 215 71
be 0 215 71
spared 0 215 71
and 0 215 71
the 0 215 71
Lord 0 215 71
did 0 215 71
what 0 215 71
man 0 215 71
failed 0 215 71
to 0 215 71
do 0 215 71
when 0 215 71
they 0 215 71
had 0 215 71

it. 0 215 71

Question: 0 215 72
How 1 215 72
do 1 215 72
you 1 215 72
show 1 215 72
mercy 1 215 72
to 1 215 72
a 1 215 72
people 1 215 72
who 1 215 72
observe 1 215 72
lying 1 215 72
vanities 1 215 72
(Jonah 1 215 72
2:4) 1 215 72
and 1 215 72
refuse 1 215 72
to 1 215 72
return 1 215 72
to 1 215 72
the 1 215 72
Lord 1 215 72
(Jeremiah 1 215 72
6:16) 1 215 72
on 1 215 72
His 1 215 72
terms? 1 215 72

(Jeremiah 0 215 73
22:3) 0 215 73
God 0 215 73
must 0 215 73
be 0 215 73
true 0 215 73
and 0 215 73
judgment 0 215 73
must 0 215 73
commence. 0 215 73

Men 0 215 74
today, 0 215 74
like 0 215 74
those 0 215 74
of 0 215 74
Sodom 0 215 74
and 0 215 74
Gomorrah, 0 215 74
are 0 215 74
not 0 215 74
valiant 0 215 74
for 0 215 74
the 0 215 74
truth. 0 215 74

They 0 215 75
are 0 215 75
valiant 0 215 75
to 0 215 75
proceed 0 215 75
from 0 215 75
evil 0 215 75
to 0 215 75
evil 0 215 75
(Jeremiah 0 215 75
5). 0 215 75

They 0 215 76
care 0 215 76
more 0 215 76
about 0 215 76
the 0 215 76
pleasures 0 215 76
of 0 215 76
sin 0 215 76
for 0 215 76
a 0 215 76
season, 0 215 76
than 0 215 76
they 0 215 76
are 0 215 76
grieved 0 215 76
for 0 215 76
the 0 215 76
afflictions 0 215 76
of 0 215 76
Joseph 0 215 76
(Amos 0 215 76
6:6; 0 215 76
Hebrews 0 215 76
11:25). 0 215 76

Men 0 215 77
today 0 215 77
care 0 215 77
more 0 215 77
of 0 215 77
compromise 0 215 77
(where 0 215 77
two 0 215 77
men 0 215 77
both 0 215 77

on 0 215 77
what 0 215 77
they 0 215 77
both 0 215 77
know 0 215 77
is 0 215 77

and 0 215 77
diplomacy 0 215 77
(seduction 0 215 77
in 0 215 77

in 0 215 77
promoting 0 215 77
anarchy 0 215 77
through 0 215 77
“antinomianism” 0 215 77
than 0 215 77
they 0 215 77
do 0 215 77
the 0 215 77
Law 0 215 77
of 0 215 77
God 0 215 77
against 0 215 77
the 0 215 77
sins 0 215 77
unto 0 215 77
judgment 0 215 77
that 0 215 77
enslave 0 215 77
men 0 215 77
(John 0 215 77
8:34). 0 215 77

Instead 0 215 78
of 0 215 78
establishing 0 215 78
judgment 0 215 78
within 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
gate 0 215 78
and 0 215 78
hating 0 215 78

in 0 215 78

that 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
Lord 0 215 78
may 0 215 78
be 0 215 78
gracious 0 215 78
to 0 215 78
their 0 215 78
repentance 0 215 78
(2 0 215 78
Corinthians 0 215 78
7:10), 0 215 78
they 0 215 78
reject 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
counsel 0 215 78
of 0 215 78
God 0 215 78
against 0 215 78
them 0 215 78
by 0 215 78
hating 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
good 0 215 78
and 0 215 78
loving 0 215 78

and 0 215 78
that 0 215 78
to 0 215 78
their 0 215 78
own 0 215 78
damnation. 0 215 78

They 1 215 79
care 1 215 79
more 0 215 79
about 0 215 79
the 0 215 79
approbation 0 215 79
and 0 215 79
favor 0 215 79
of 0 215 79
men 0 215 79
than 0 215 79
they 0 215 79
do 0 215 79
that 0 215 79
of 0 215 79
the 0 215 79
Living 0 215 79
God 0 215 79
and 0 215 79
what 0 215 79
His 0 215 79
Word 0 215 79
declares 0 215 79
(Galatians 0 215 79
1:10),not 0 215 79
knowing 0 215 79
that 0 215 79
which 0 215 79
his 0 215 79
highly 0 215 79
favored 0 215 79
among 0 215 79
men 0 215 79
is 0 215 79
an 0 215 79
abomination 0 215 79
unto 0 215 79
the 0 215 79
Lord 0 215 79
(Luke 0 215 79
16:15). 0 215 79

They 0 215 80
wear 0 215 80
the 0 215 80
cross. 0 215 80

Yet, 0 215 81
they 0 215 81
have 0 215 81
no 0 215 81
testimony 0 215 81
of 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
power 0 215 81
of 0 215 81
God 0 215 81
unto 0 215 81
salvation 0 215 81
by 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
cross 0 215 81
because 0 215 81
they 0 215 81
do 0 215 81
not 0 215 81
practice 0 215 81
what 0 215 81
Christ 0 215 81
required: 0 215 81
“Deny 0 215 81
yourselves 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
take 0 215 81
up 0 215 81
your 0 215 81

(Matthew 0 215 81

2:21). 0 215 81

Professed 1 215 82
Christians 1 215 82
in 1 215 82
America 1 215 82
today 1 215 82
talk 1 215 82
much 1 215 82
of 1 215 82
love 1 215 82
through 1 215 82
inaction, 1 215 82
and 1 215 82
yet 1 215 82
know 1 215 82
nothing 1 215 82
of 1 215 82
it 1 215 82
(1 1 215 82
John 1 215 82
3:18). 1 215 82

They 1 215 83
read 1 215 83
what 1 215 83
to 1 215 83
do, 1 215 83
but 1 215 83
do 1 215 83
it 1 215 83
not! 1 215 83

In 1 215 84
fact, 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
declare 1 215 84
and 1 215 84
proclaim 1 215 84
how 1 215 84
much 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
love 1 215 84
God, 1 215 84
and 1 215 84
yet 1 215 84
if 1 215 84
you 1 215 84
were 1 215 84
to 1 215 84
have 1 215 84
them 1 215 84
read 1 215 84
His 1 215 84
moral 1 215 84
law 1 215 84
and 1 215 84
look 1 215 84
to 1 215 84
their 1 215 84
own 1 215 84
lives, 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
would 1 215 84
find 1 215 84
how 1 215 84
much 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
actually 1 215 84
hate 1 215 84
God 1 215 84
through 1 215 84
their 1 215 84
actions 1 215 84
(Matthew 1 215 84
15:8). 1 215 84

Then 0 215 85
again, 0 215 85
these 0 215 85
were 0 215 85
the 0 215 85
same 0 215 85
types 0 215 85
of 0 215 85
people 0 215 85
in 0 215 85
Jerusalem 0 215 85
crying 0 215 85
out 0 215 85
"Crucify 0 215 85
him! 0 215 85

Crucify 0 215 86
him! 0 215 86

We 0 215 87
have 0 215 87
no 0 215 87
king 0 215 87
but 0 215 87
Caesar" 0 215 87
(John 0 215 87
19:15). 0 215 87

And 0 215 88
these 0 215 88
are 0 215 88
the 0 215 88
same 0 215 88
people 0 215 88
today 0 215 88
persecuting 0 215 88
living 0 215 88
Christians 0 215 88
while 0 215 88
praising 0 215 88
the 0 215 88
dead 0 215 88
ones 0 215 88
(Matthew 0 215 88
5:10). 0 215 88

They 0 215 89
continuously 0 215 89
preach 0 215 89
of 0 215 89
the 0 215 89
heroism 0 215 89
of 0 215 89
Abraham, 0 215 89
Moses, 0 215 89
Joshua, 0 215 89
David, 0 215 89
Gideon, 0 215 89
Samson 0 215 89
and 0 215 89
others 0 215 89
from 0 215 89
the 0 215 89
pulpit 0 215 89
and 0 215 89
fail 0 215 89
to 0 215 89
understand 0 215 89
what 0 215 89
these 0 215 89
men 0 215 89
were 0 215 89
doing 0 215 89
when 0 215 89
serving 0 215 89
their 0 215 89
generations 0 215 89
(Psalm 0 215 89
71:18-19; 0 215 89
Isaiah 0 215 89
51:4). 0 215 89

Today, 0 215 90
instead 0 215 90
of 0 215 90
doing 0 215 90
the 0 215 90
same, 0 215 90
they 0 215 90
simply 0 215 90
hide 0 215 90
under 0 215 90
a 0 215 90
false 0 215 90
grace 0 215 90
(Isaiah 0 215 90
30) 0 215 90
and 0 215 90
give 0 215 90
themselves 0 215 90
over 0 215 90
to 0 215 90
a 0 215 90
man, 0 215 90
the 0 215 90
president, 0 215 90
and 0 215 90
declare 0 215 90
end 0 215 90
times. 0 215 90

They 0 215 91
declare 0 215 91
we're 0 215 91
in 0 215 91
the 0 215 91
end 0 215 91
times 0 215 91
because 0 215 91
they 0 215 91
have 0 215 91
failed 0 215 91
to 0 215 91
stand 0 215 91
up 0 215 91
and 0 215 91
fight 0 215 91
for 0 215 91
their 0 215 91
posterity 0 215 91
in 0 215 91
keeping 0 215 91
the 0 215 91
Lord's 0 215 91
commandments 0 215 91
and 0 215 91
His 0 215 91
judgments 0 215 91
(Psalm 0 215 91
78:1-11). 0 215 91

Ungrateful 1 215 92
reprobates, 1 215 92
pretenders, 1 215 92
counterfeits 1 215 92
and 1 215 92
hypocrites 1 215 92
are 0 215 92
what 0 215 92
they 0 215 92
are 0 215 92
(Matthew 0 215 92
23:3). 0 215 92

Instead 1 215 93
of 1 215 93
reaching 1 215 93
out 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
the 1 215 93
greatest 1 215 93
demographic 1 215 93

in 1 215 93
America, 1 215 93
public 1 215 93
high 1 215 93
schools, 1 215 93
they 1 215 93
send 1 215 93
missionaries 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
foreign 1 215 93
lands 1 215 93
to 1 215 93

there 1 215 93
what 1 215 93
they 1 215 93
fail 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
do 1 215 93
for 1 215 93
their 1 215 93
own 1 215 93
here. 1 215 93

Instead 1 215 94
of 1 215 94
fighting 1 215 94
for 1 215 94
their 1 215 94
posterity 1 215 94
and 1 215 94
shutting 1 215 94
down 1 215 94
the 1 215 94
illegalities 1 215 94
of 1 215 94
sodomy 1 215 94
in 1 215 94
all 1 215 94
50 1 215 94
states, 1 215 94
they 1 215 94
teach 1 215 94
them 1 215 94
to 1 215 94
just 1 215 94
do 1 215 94
their 1 215 94
best 1 215 94
to 1 215 94
understand 1 215 94
that 1 215 94
they 1 215 94
cannot 1 215 94
help 1 215 94
themselves 1 215 94
while 1 215 94
God 1 215 94
say’s 1 215 94
the 1 215 94
opposite 1 215 94
(Leviticus 1 215 94
20:18). 1 215 94

Instead 1 215 95
of 1 215 95
fighting 1 215 95
on 1 215 95
their 1 215 95
behalf 1 215 95
against 1 215 95
the 1 215 95
federal 1 215 95
government 1 215 95
that 1 215 95
is 1 215 95
illegally 1 215 95
indoctrinating 1 215 95
them, 1 215 95
they 1 215 95
simply 1 215 95
give 1 215 95
their 1 215 95
kids 1 215 95
over 1 215 95
to 1 215 95
them 1 215 95
to 1 215 95
be 1 215 95
dumbed 1 215 95
down. 1 215 95

And 1 215 96
instead 1 215 96
of 1 215 96
protesting 1 215 96
the 1 215 96
murder 1 215 96

(Proverbs 1 215 96

they 1 215 96
merely 1 215 96
pass 1 215 96
it 1 215 96
off 1 215 96
as 1 215 96
a 1 215 96
"choice," 1 215 96
that 1 215 96

learned 1 215 96
from 1 215 96
the 1 215 96

The 1 215 97
American 1 215 97
Church, 1 215 97
instead 1 215 97
of 1 215 97
protesting 1 215 97

in 1 215 97

through 1 215 97

submit 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
tyranny 1 215 97
as 1 215 97
if 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
suggest 1 215 97
that 1 215 97
it 1 215 97
is 1 215 97
somehow 1 215 97
obedience 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
God 1 215 97
(Romans 1 215 97
12:21). 1 215 97

The 1 215 98
Church 1 215 98
in 1 215 98
America 1 215 98
has 1 215 98
failed 1 215 98
to 1 215 98
keep 1 215 98
the 1 215 98
Commandments 1 215 98
of 1 215 98
the 1 215 98
God 1 215 98
of 1 215 98
Israel. 1 215 98

Instead 1 215 99
of 1 215 99
preaching 1 215 99
out 1 215 99
against 1 215 99
sin, 1 215 99
they 1 215 99
advocate 1 215 99
for 1 215 99
that 1 215 99
which 1 215 99
God 1 215 99
clearly 1 215 99
condemns, 1 215 99
thereby 1 215 99
making 1 215 99
war 1 215 99
against 1 215 99
God 1 215 99
(Micah 1 215 99
3:5), 1 215 99
which 1 215 99
at 1 215 99
length 1 215 99
destroys 1 215 99
our 1 215 99
government, 1 215 99
our 1 215 99
country 1 215 99
and 1 215 99
our 1 215 99
families. 1 215 99

Look 1 215 100
to 1 215 100
their 1 215 100
feigned 1 215 100
strength 1 215 100
that 1 215 100
they 1 215 100
profess 1 215 100
to 1 215 100
possess. 1 215 100

It 1 215 101
is 1 215 101
gauged 1 215 101
by 1 215 101
simply 1 215 101
looking 1 215 101
to 1 215 101
the 1 215 101
prevailing 1 215 101
immoralities 1 215 101
and 1 215 101
debauchers 1 215 101
of 1 215 101
society. 1 215 101

They 1 215 102
are 1 215 102
weak 1 215 102
and 1 215 102
pathetic 1 215 102
and 1 215 102
they 1 215 102
have 1 215 102
no 1 215 102
excuses 1 215 102
as 1 215 102
to 1 215 102
why 1 215 102
America 1 215 102
is 1 215 102
where 1 215 102
we 1 215 102
is 1 215 102
today! 1 215 102

Why 0 215 103
did 0 215 103
God 0 215 103
judge 0 215 103
Sodom 0 215 103
and 0 215 103
Gomorrah? 0 215 103

It's 1 215 104
the 1 215 104
same 1 215 104
reason 1 215 104
that 1 215 104
he 1 215 104
is 1 215 104
judging 1 215 104
America 1 215 104
today 1 215 104
(Amos 1 215 104
4:12), 1 215 104
He 1 215 104
cannot 1 215 104
find 1 215 104
the 1 215 104
righteous 1 215 104
in 1 215 104
order 1 215 104
to 1 215 104
spare 1 215 104
her 1 215 104
(Jeremiah 0 215 104
22:3). 0 215 104

Defining 0 215 105
the 1 215 105
Wicked… 1 215 105

Wicked 0 215 106
men 0 215 106
in 0 215 106
the 0 215 106
sight 0 215 106
of 0 215 106
God 0 215 106
are 0 215 106
those 0 215 106
who 0 215 106
have 0 215 106
the 0 215 106
knowledge 0 215 106
of 0 215 106
what 0 215 106
to 0 215 106
do 0 215 106
when 0 215 106
it 0 215 106
comes 0 215 106
to 0 215 106
the 0 215 106
right, 0 215 106
but 0 215 106
over 0 215 106
and 0 215 106
over 0 215 106
again, 0 215 106
they 0 215 106
turn 0 215 106
their 0 215 106
shoulders 0 215 106
and 0 215 106
choose 0 215 106
the 0 215 106
wrong, 0 215 106
through 1 215 106
tolerance 1 215 106
and 1 215 106
apathy 1 215 106
Americans 1 215 106
are 1 215 106
bringing 1 215 106
upon 1 215 106
themselves 1 215 106
destruction 1 215 106
(Deuteronomy 0 215 106
30:19) 0 215 106
that 0 215 106
will 0 215 106
not 0 215 106
be 0 215 106
reversed, 0 215 106
which 1 215 106
leaves 1 215 106
no 1 215 106
alternative 1 215 106
as 1 215 106
to 1 215 106
why 1 215 106
God 1 215 106
judges 1 215 106
and 1 215 106
is 1 215 106
judging 1 215 106
