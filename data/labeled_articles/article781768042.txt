exactly 0
the 0
Scriptural 0
point 0
that 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
make. 0

From 0
the 0
pulpits 0
in 0
America 0
today 0
we 0
here 0
the 0
events 0
unfold 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorra 0
and 0
how 0
Abraham 0
should 0
have 0
prayed 0
longer 0
in 0
hopes 0
that 0
God 0
would 0
have 0
spared 0
them 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
righteous 0
people 0
in 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorra 0
doing 0
what 0
God 0
had 0
commanded. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
not 0
a 0
second 0
thought 0
on 0
man's 0
behalf 0
is 0
given 0
concerning 0
the 0
victims 0
in 0
these 0
two 0
cities. 0

Here 0
is 0
Abraham’s 0
account… 0

“And 0
the 0
men 0
rose 0
up 0
from 0
thence, 0
and 0
looked 0
toward 0
Sodom: 0
and 0
Abraham 0
went 0
with 0
them 0
to 0
bring 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
way. 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
said, 0
Shall 0
I 0
hide 0
from 0
Abraham 0
that 0
thing 0
which 0
I 0
do; 0
Seeing 0
that 0
Abraham 0
shall 0
surely 0
become 0
a 0
great 0
and 0
mighty 0
nation, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
nations 0
of 0
the 0
earth 0
shall 0
be 0
blessed 0
in 0
him? 0

For 0
I 0
know 0
him, 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
command 0
his 0
children 0
and 0
his 0
household 0
after 0
him, 0
and 0
they 0
shall 0
keep 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
the 0
Lord, 0
to 0
do 0
justice 0
and 0
judgment; 0
that 0
the 0
Lord 0
may 0
bring 0
upon 0
Abraham 0
that 0
which 0
he 0
hath 0
spoken 0
of 0
him. 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
said, 0
Because 0
the 0
cry 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
is 0
great, 0
and 0
because 0
their 0
sin 0
is 0
very 0
grievous; 0
I 0
will 0
go 0
down 0
now, 0
and 0
see 0
whether 0
they 0
have 0
done 0
altogether 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
cry 0
of 0
it, 0
which 0
is 0
come 0
unto 0
me; 0
and 0
if 0
not, 0
I 0
will 0
know. 0

And 0
the 0
men 0
turned 0
their 0
faces 0
from 0
thence, 0
and 0
went 0
toward 0
Sodom: 0
but 0
Abraham 0
stood 0
yet 0
before 0
the 0
Lord. 0

And 0
Abraham 0
drew 0
near, 0
and 0
said, 0
Wilt 0
thou 0
also 0
destroy 0
the 1
righteous 1
with 0
the 1
wicked? 1

Peradventure 0
there 0
be 0
fifty 0
righteous 1
within 0
the 0
city: 0
wilt 0
thou 0
also 0
destroy 0
and 0
not 0
spare 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
the 0
fifty 0
righteous 1
that 0
are 0
therein? 0

That 0
be 0
far 0
from 0
thee 0
to 0
do 0
after 0
this 0
manner, 0
to 0
slay 0
the 1
righteous 1
with 0
the 1
wicked: 1
and 0
that 0
the 1
righteous 1
should 0
be 0
as 0
the 1
wicked, 1
that 0
be 0
far 0
from 0
thee: 0
Shall 0
not 0
the 0
Judge 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
earth 0
do 0
right? 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
said, 0
If 0
I 0
find 0
in 0
Sodom 0
fifty 0
righteous 1
within 0
the 0
city, 0
then 0
I 0
will 0
spare 0
all 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
their 0
sakes. 0

And 0
Abraham 0
answered 0
and 0
said, 0
Behold 0
now, 0
I 0
have 0
taken 0
upon 0
me 0
to 0
speak 0
unto 0
the 0
Lord, 0
which 0
am 0
but 0
dust 0
and 0
ashes: 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
lack 0
five 0
of 0
the 0
fifty 0
righteous: 1
wilt 0
thou 0
destroy 0
all 0
the 0
city 0
for 0
lack 0
of 0
five? 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
If 0
I 0
find 0
there 0
forty 0
and 0
five, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
destroy 0
it. 0

And 0
he 0
spake 0
unto 0
him 0
yet 0
again, 0
and 0
said, 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
be 0
forty 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
do 0
it 0
for 0
forty's 0
sake. 0

And 0
he 0
said 0
unto 0
him, 0
Oh 0
let 0
not 0
the 0
Lord 0
be 0
angry, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
speak: 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
thirty 0
be 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
do 0
it, 0
if 0
I 0
find 0
thirty 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
Behold 0
now, 0
I 0
have 0
taken 0
upon 0
me 0
to 0
speak 0
unto 0
theLord: 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
be 0
twenty 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
destroy 0
it 0
for 0
twenty's 0
sake. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
Oh 0
let 0
not 0
the 0
Lord 0
be 0
angry, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
speak 0
yet 0
but 0
this 0
once: 0
Peradventure 0
ten 0
shall 0
be 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
destroy 0
it 0
for 0
ten's 0
sake. 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
went 0
his 0
way, 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
left 0
communing 0
with 0
Abraham: 0
and 0
Abraham 0
returned 0
unto 0
his 0
place." 0

Genesis 0
chapter 0
19 0
records 0
the 0
two 0
angels, 0
disguised 0
as 0
human 0
men, 0
visiting 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah. 0

Lot 0
met 0
the 0
angels 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
square 0
and 0
urged 0
them 0
to 0
stay 0
at 0
his 0
house. 0

The 0
angels 0
agreed. 0

The 0
Bible 0
then 0
informs 0
us, 0
"Before 0
they 0
had 0
gone 0
to 0
bed, 0
all 0
the 0
men 0
from 0
every 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
city 0
of 0
Sodom 0
— 0
both 0
young 0
and 0
old 0
— 0
surrounded 0
the 0
house. 0

They 0
called 0
to 0
Lot, 0
'Where 0
are 0
the 0
men 0
who 0
came 0
to 0
you 0
tonight? 0

Bring 0
them 0
out 0
to 0
us 0
so 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
have 1
sex 1
with 1
them. 1

Genesis 0
19:4-5 0
The 0
angels 0
then 0
proceed 0
to 0
blind 0
all 0
the 0
men 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
and 0
urge 0
Lot 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
to 0
flee 0
from 0
the 0
cities 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
wrath 0
that 0
God 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
deliver. 0

Lot 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
flee 0
the 0
city, 0
and 0
then 0
"the 1
LORD 1
rained 1
down 1
burning 1
sulfur 1
on 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
— 0
from 0
the 0
LORD 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
heavens. 0

Thus 0
he 0
overthrew 0
those 0
cities 0
and 0
the 0
entire 0
plain, 0
including 0
all 0
those 0
living 0
in 0
the 0
cities..." 0
(Genesis 0
19:2 0
4) 0
. 0

In 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
passage, 0
the 0
most 0
common 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
question, 0
"What 0
was 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah?" 0

is 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
homosexuality. 0

That 0
is 0
how 0
the 0
term 0
”sodomy” 0
came 0
to 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
refer 0
to 0
anal 0
sex 0
between 0
two 0
men, 0
whether 0
consensual 0
or 0
forced. 0

Clearly, 0
homosexuality 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
reason 0
God 0
destroyed 0
the 0
two 0
cities. 0

The 0
men 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
wanted 1
to 1
perform 1
homosexual 1
gang 1
rape 1
on 1
the 1
two 1
angels, 1
who 0
were 0
disguised 0
as 0
men. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
biblical 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
homosexuality 0
was 0
the 0
exclusive 0
reason 0
why 0
God 0
destroyed 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah. 0

The 0
cities 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
definitely 0
not 0
exclusive 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
sins 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
indulged. 0

Ezekiel 0
16:49-50 0
declares, 0
"Now 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
your 0
sister 0
Sodom: 0
She 1
and 1
her 1
daughters 1
were 1
arrogant, 1
overfed 1
and 1
unconcerned; 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
help 1
the 1
poor 1
and 1
needy. 1

They 1
were 1
haughty 1
and 1
did 1
detestable 1
things 1
before 1
me..." 0
The 0
Hebrew 0
word 0
translated 0
"detestable" 0
refers 0
to 0
something 0
that 0
is 0
morally 1
disgusting 1
and 0
is 0
the 0
exact 0
same 0
word 0
used 0
in 0
Leviticus 0
18:22 0
that 0
refers 0
to 0
homosexuality 0
as 0
an 0
"abomination." 1

Similarly, 0
Jude 0
7 0
declares, 0
"...Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
and 0
the 0
surrounding 0
towns 0
gave 1
themselves 1
up 1
to 1
sexual 1
immorality 1
and 1
perversion." 1

So, 0
again, 0
while 0
homosexuality 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
sin 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
cities 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
indulged, 0
it 0
does 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
primary 0
reason 0
for 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
cities. 0

Those 0
who 0
attempt 0
to 0
explain 0
away 0
the 0
biblical 0
condemnations 0
of 0
homosexuality 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
was 0
inhospitality. 0

The 0
men 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
certainly 0
being 0
inhospitable. 0

There 1
is 1
probably 1
nothing 1
more 1
inhospitable 1
than 1
homosexual 1
gang 1
rape. 1

But 0
to 0
say 0
God 0
completely 0
destroyed 0
two 0
cities 0
and 0
all 0
their 0
inhabitants 0
for 0
being 0
inhospitable 0
clearly 0
misses 0
the 0
point. 0

While 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
guilty 0
of 0
many 0
other 0
horrendous 1
sins, 1
homosexuality 1
was 1
the 1
reason 1
God 1
poured 1
fiery 1
sulfur 1
on 1
the 1
cities, 1
completely 1
destroying 1
them 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
their 1
inhabitants. 1

To 0
this 0
day, 0
the 0
area 0
where 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
located 0
remains 0
a 0
desolate 0
wasteland. 0

Sodom 1
and 1
Gomorrah 1
serve 1
as 1
a 1
powerful 1
example 1
of 1
how 1
God 1
feels 1
about 1
sin 1
in 1
general, 1
and 1
homosexuality 1
specifically. 1

The 0
point 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
no 0
righteous 1
to 0
be 0
spared 0
and 0
the 0
Lord 0
did 0
what 0
man 0
failed 0
to 0
do 0
when 0
they 0
had 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

Question: 0
How 1
do 1
you 1
show 1
mercy 1
to 1
a 1
people 1
who 1
observe 1
lying 1
vanities 1
(Jonah 1
2:4) 1
and 1
refuse 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
Lord 1
(Jeremiah 1
6:16) 1
on 1
His 1
terms? 1

(Jeremiah 0
22:3) 0
God 0
must 0
be 0
true 0
and 0
judgment 0
must 0
commence. 0

Men 0
today, 0
like 0
those 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah, 0
are 0
not 0
valiant 0
for 0
the 0
truth. 0

They 0
are 0
valiant 0
to 0
proceed 0
from 0
evil 0
to 0
evil 0
(Jeremiah 0
5). 0

They 0
care 0
more 0
about 0
the 0
pleasures 0
of 0
sin 0
for 0
a 0
season, 0
than 0
they 0
are 0
grieved 0
for 0
the 0
afflictions 0
of 0
Joseph 0
(Amos 0
6:6; 0
Hebrews 0
11:25). 0

Men 0
today 0
care 0
more 0
of 0
compromise 0
(where 0
two 0
men 0
both 0
agree 0
on 0
what 0
they 0
both 0
know 0
is 0
wrong) 0
and 0
diplomacy 0
(seduction 0
in 0
another 0
guise) 0
in 0
promoting 0
anarchy 0
through 0
“antinomianism” 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
the 0
Law 0
of 0
God 0
against 0
the 0
sins 0
unto 0
judgment 0
that 0
enslave 0
men 0
(John 0
8:34). 0

Instead 0
of 0
establishing 0
judgment 0
within 0
the 0
gate 0
and 0
hating 0
the 0
evil 0
and 0
loving 0
the 0
good 0
(Amos 0
5:15) 0
in 0
hopes 0
that 0
the 0
Lord 0
may 0
be 0
gracious 0
to 0
their 0
repentance 0
(2 0
Corinthians 0
7:10), 0
they 0
reject 0
the 0
counsel 0
of 0
God 0
against 0
them 0
by 0
hating 0
the 0
good 0
and 0
loving 0
the 0
evil, 0
and 0
that 0
to 0
their 0
own 0
damnation. 0

They 1
care 1
more 0
about 0
the 0
approbation 0
and 0
favor 0
of 0
men 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Living 0
God 0
and 0
what 0
His 0
Word 0
declares 0
(Galatians 0
1:10),not 0
knowing 0
that 0
which 0
his 0
highly 0
favored 0
among 0
men 0
is 0
an 0
abomination 0
unto 0
the 0
Lord 0
(Luke 0
16:15). 0

They 0
wear 0
the 0
cross. 0

Yet, 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
testimony 0
of 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
God 0
unto 0
salvation 0
by 0
the 0
cross 0
because 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
practice 0
what 0
Christ 0
required: 0
“Deny 0
yourselves 0
and 0
take 0
up 0
your 0
cross 0
and 0
follow 0
Me” 0
(Matthew 0
16:24; 0
Romans 0
1:16; 0
2 0
Corinthians 0
5:15, 0
13:4-5; 0
Galatians 0
2:21). 0

Professed 1
Christians 1
in 1
America 1
today 1
talk 1
much 1
of 1
love 1
through 1
inaction, 1
and 1
yet 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
(1 1
John 1
3:18). 1

They 1
read 1
what 1
to 1
do, 1
but 1
do 1
it 1
not! 1

In 1
fact, 1
they 1
declare 1
and 1
proclaim 1
how 1
much 1
they 1
love 1
God, 1
and 1
yet 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
read 1
His 1
moral 1
law 1
and 1
look 1
to 1
their 1
own 1
lives, 1
they 1
would 1
find 1
how 1
much 1
they 1
actually 1
hate 1
God 1
through 1
their 1
actions 1
(Matthew 1
15:8). 1

Then 0
again, 0
these 0
were 0
the 0
same 0
types 0
of 0
people 0
in 0
Jerusalem 0
crying 0
out 0
"Crucify 0
him! 0

Crucify 0
him! 0

We 0
have 0
no 0
king 0
but 0
Caesar" 0
(John 0
19:15). 0

And 0
these 0
are 0
the 0
same 0
people 0
today 0
persecuting 0
living 0
Christians 0
while 0
praising 0
the 0
dead 0
ones 0
(Matthew 0
5:10). 0

They 0
continuously 0
preach 0
of 0
the 0
heroism 0
of 0
Abraham, 0
Moses, 0
Joshua, 0
David, 0
Gideon, 0
Samson 0
and 0
others 0
from 0
the 0
pulpit 0
and 0
fail 0
to 0
understand 0
what 0
these 0
men 0
were 0
doing 0
when 0
serving 0
their 0
generations 0
(Psalm 0
71:18-19; 0
Isaiah 0
51:4). 0

Today, 0
instead 0
of 0
doing 0
the 0
same, 0
they 0
simply 0
hide 0
under 0
a 0
false 0
grace 0
(Isaiah 0
30) 0
and 0
give 0
themselves 0
over 0
to 0
a 0
man, 0
the 0
president, 0
and 0
declare 0
end 0
times. 0

They 0
declare 0
we're 0
in 0
the 0
end 0
times 0
because 0
they 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
and 0
fight 0
for 0
their 0
posterity 0
in 0
keeping 0
the 0
Lord's 0
commandments 0
and 0
His 0
judgments 0
(Psalm 0
78:1-11). 0

Ungrateful 1
reprobates, 1
pretenders, 1
counterfeits 1
and 1
hypocrites 1
are 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
(Matthew 0
23:3). 0

Instead 1
of 1
reaching 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
demographic 1
here 1
in 1
America, 1
public 1
high 1
schools, 1
they 1
send 1
missionaries 1
to 1
foreign 1
lands 1
to 1
do 1
there 1
what 1
they 1
fail 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
their 1
own 1
here. 1

Instead 1
of 1
fighting 1
for 1
their 1
posterity 1
and 1
shutting 1
down 1
the 1
illegalities 1
of 1
sodomy 1
in 1
all 1
50 1
states, 1
they 1
teach 1
them 1
to 1
just 1
do 1
their 1
best 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
help 1
themselves 1
while 1
God 1
say’s 1
the 1
opposite 1
(Leviticus 1
20:18). 1

Instead 1
of 1
fighting 1
on 1
their 1
behalf 1
against 1
the 1
federal 1
government 1
that 1
is 1
illegally 1
indoctrinating 1
them, 1
they 1
simply 1
give 1
their 1
kids 1
over 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
dumbed 1
down. 1

And 1
instead 1
of 1
protesting 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
58 1
million 1
innocent 1
babies 1
(Proverbs 1
6:17), 1
they 1
merely 1
pass 1
it 1
off 1
as 1
a 1
"choice," 1
that 1
being 1
the 1
lessons 1
that 1
they 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
media 1
that 1
they 1
say 1
that 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
believe 1
(Romans 1
1:18). 1

The 1
American 1
Church, 1
instead 1
of 1
protesting 1
corruption 1
in 1
government 1
through 1
the 1
example 1
of 1
the 1
Biblical 1
patriarchs 1
and 1
our 1
American 1
forefathers 1
(Matthew 1
5:17-18), 1
teach 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
tyranny 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
suggest 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
somehow 1
obedience 1
to 1
God 1
(Romans 1
12:21). 1

The 1
Church 1
in 1
America 1
has 1
failed 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
Commandments 1
of 1
the 1
God 1
of 1
Israel. 1

Instead 1
of 1
preaching 1
out 1
against 1
sin, 1
they 1
advocate 1
for 1
that 1
which 1
God 1
clearly 1
condemns, 1
thereby 1
making 1
war 1
against 1
God 1
(Micah 1
3:5), 1
which 1
at 1
length 1
destroys 1
our 1
government, 1
our 1
country 1
and 1
our 1
families. 1

Look 1
to 1
their 1
feigned 1
strength 1
that 1
they 1
profess 1
to 1
possess. 1

It 1
is 1
gauged 1
by 1
simply 1
looking 1
to 1
the 1
prevailing 1
immoralities 1
and 1
debauchers 1
of 1
society. 1

They 1
are 1
weak 1
and 1
pathetic 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
excuses 1
as 1
to 1
why 1
America 1
is 1
where 1
we 1
is 1
today! 1

Why 0
did 0
God 0
judge 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah? 0

It's 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
judging 1
America 1
today 1
(Amos 1
4:12), 1
He 1
cannot 1
find 1
the 1
righteous 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
(Jeremiah 0
22:3). 0

Defining 0
the 1
Wicked… 1

Wicked 0
men 0
in 0
the 0

the 0
knowledge 0

what 0

when 0
it 0

over 0

again, 0
they 0

their 0

choose 0
the 0
wrong, 0
through 1
tolerance 1

apathy 1
Americans 1

bringing 1
upon 1
themselves 1
destruction 1
(Deuteronomy 0
30:19) 0
that 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
reversed, 0
which 1
leaves 1
no 1
alternative 1
as 1
to 1
why 1

America 1
today 1
(Deuteronomy 0
