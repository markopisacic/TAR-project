This 0 98 27

At 0 98 33
the 0 98 33
very 0 98 33

They 0 98 35
are 0 98 35

that 0 98 36
wasn’t 0 98 36
her’s 0 98 36
and 0 98 36
killing 0 98 36
an 0 98 36
innocent 1 98 36
man 0 98 36
was 0 98 36
simply 0 98 36
a 0 98 36
case 0 98 36
of 0 98 36

ruined 0 98 36

that 0 98 37

killing 0 98 39
her—would 0 98 39
police 0 98 39
and 0 98 39
Ted 0 98 39

simply 0 98 39

it 0 98 39
off 0 98 39

we 0 98 40
know 0 98 40
the 0 98 40
