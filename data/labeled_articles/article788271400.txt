Cruz 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
call 0
the 0
situation 0
a 0
tragedy 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
jury 0
of 0
her 0
peers 0
finds 0
she 0
did 0
something 0
wrong 0
then 0
Guyger 0
should 0
suffer 0
the 0
consequences. 0

To 0
be 0
clear, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
admitted 0
to 0
doing 0
something 0
wrong. 0

While 0
controversy 0
swarms 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
why 0
she 0
may 0
have 0
killed 0
Jean, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
kill 0
him. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

This 0
public 0
servant 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
innocent 1
man’s 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
dead. 0

Because 0
of 0
her 0
actions, 0
this 0
man 0
no 0
longer 0
lives. 0

That, 0
Senator 0
Ted 0
Cruz, 0
is 0
wrong. 0

Mistake 0
or 0
not, 0
she 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man. 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
to 0
blame 0
and 0
yet 0
she 0
is 0
still 0
collecting 0
a 0
paycheck 0
from 0
taxpayers. 0

Calling 0
for 0
Gugyer 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
calling 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
for 0
making 0
stupid 0
Instagram 0
posts 0
or 0
saying 0
stupid 0
things—she 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
she 0
should 0
be 0
fired 0
from 0
her 0
job 0
which 0
gave 0
her 0
the 0
gun 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

What 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
is 0
doing 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
their 0
apologists 0
are 0
doing. 0

They 0
are 0
treating 0
Guyger 0
differently 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
system. 0

In 0
Cruz’s 0
eyes, 0
Guyger 0
going 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
that 0
wasn’t 0
her’s 0
and 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
was 0
simply 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
being 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
place 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
time—a 0
tragic 0
mistake 0
that 0
ruined 0
two 0
lives, 0
according 0
to 0
Cruz. 0

But 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
case 0
at 0
all. 0

Would 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
and 0
police 0
officers 0
be 0
following 0
this 0
same 0
narrative 0
if 0
the 0
roles 0
were 0
reversed? 0

If 0
it 0
was 0
Botham 0
Jean, 0
a 1
black 1
man, 1
walking 0
into 0
the 0
apartment 0
of 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
a 0
white 1
female 1
cop, 1
and 0
killing 0
her—would 0
police 0
and 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
simply 0
write 0
it 0
off 0
as 0
a 0
tragic 0
accident? 0

Of 0
course, 0
we 0
know 0
the 0
answer 0
to 0
that 0
question 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
resounding, 0
NO. 0

To 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
peanut 0
gallery 0
before 0
it 0
begins, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
some 0
case 0
of 0
Democrat 0
versus 0
Republican 0
or 0
right 0
versus 0
left. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
right 0
versus 0
wrong, 0
and 0
what 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
did 0
to 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
was 0
wrong. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
way 0
around 0
it, 0
“mistake” 0
or 0
not. 0

From 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
this 0
case, 0
law 0
enforcement 0
have 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
protect 0
Guyger 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
blue 0
line. 0

Amber 0
Guyger’s 0
home 0
was 0
never 0
searched 0
while 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
was 0
searched 0
that 0
night. 0

The 0
results 0
of 0
the 0
blood 0
test 0
to 0
test 0
for 0
alcohol 0
or 0
drugs 0
in 0
her 0
system 0
were 0
never 0
released, 0
yet 0
police 0
— 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
his 0
mother 0
buried 0
her 0
son 0
— 0
claimed 0
they 0
found 0
marijuana 0
in 0
his 0
house. 0

It’s 0
been 0
a 0
smear 0
campaign 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
this 0
way 0
by 0
design. 0

Amber 0
Guyger 0
took 0
an 0
innocent 1
person’s 0
life, 0
and 0
because 0
people 0
are 0
so 0
blinded 0
by 0
the 0
badge, 0
she 0
is 0
being 0
portrayed 0
as 0
the 0
victim. 0

To 0
those 0
who 0
attempt 0
to 0
claim 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
bias 0
in 0
this 0
horrifically 1
flawed 0
system, 0
if 0
ever 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
case 0
to 0
prove 0
you 0
wrong—this 0
is 0
it. 0

A 0
tragedy 0
indeed. 0
