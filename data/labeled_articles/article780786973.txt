WASHINGTON 0
— 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
continued 0
bashing 1
Robert 0
S. 0
Mueller 0
III’s 0
Russia 0
investigation, 0
saying 1
cryptically 1
Monday 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
is 0
“looking 1
for 1
trouble.” 1

Trump 0
alleged 0
in 0
a 0
morning 0
tweet 0
series 0
that 0
the 0
former 0
FBI 0
director 0
is 0
“Disgraced 1
and 1
discredited,” 1
claiming 0
his 1
staff 1
amounts 1
to 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
“group 1
of 1
Angry 1
Democrat 1
Thugs.” 1

That 0
came 0
hours 0
after 0
a 0
Sunday 0
tweet 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
team 0
as 0
a 1
“gang.” 1
Both 0
are 0
words 0
with 0
loaded 0
meanings 0
for 0
his 0
conservative 0
political 0
base. 0

The 0
president’s 0
Sunday 0
and 0
Monday 0
attacks 0
on 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
came 0
after 0
reports 0
that 0
White 0
House 0
Counsel 0
Donald 0
McGahn 0
was 0
interviewed 0
by 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
full 0
day. 0

Trump 0
contends 0
he 0
signed 0
off 0
on 0
the 0
testimony; 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush-era 0
White 0
House 0
counsel 0
and 0
attorney 0
general 0
Alberto 0
Gonzales, 0
however, 0
told 0
CNN 0
Monday 0
morning 0
that 0
a 0
sitting 0
White 0
House 0
counsel 0
would 0
be 0
required 0
to 0
fully 0
cooperate 0
with 0
a 0
federal 0
investigation 0
because 0
he 0
is 0
a 0
government 0
lawyer, 0
not 0
a 0
president’s 0
personal 0
attorney. 0

But 0
Trump 0
on 0
Monday 0
morning 0
tweeted 0
that 0
McGahn 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
team 0
for 0
“over 0
30 0
hours 0
with 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Councel, 0
only 0
with 0
my 0
approval, 0
for 0
purposes 0
of 0
transparency.” 0
(The 1
tweet 1
included 1
a 1
misspelling 1
of 1
“counsel.”) 1

The 0
length 0
of 0
the 0
Mueller-McGahn 0
sessions 0
led 0
Trump 0
to 0
the 0
conclusion 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
is 0
“looking 1
for 1
trouble” 1
because 0
they 0
“they 1
know 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
Russian 1
Collusion.” 1

But 0
Mueller 0
reportedly 0
is 0
keenly 0
interested 0
in 0
a 0
widely 0
studied 0
June 0
2016 0
Trump 0
Tower 0
meeting 0
arranged 0
by 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
Jr., 0
which 0
included 0
a 0
Russian 0
attorney 0
who 0
promised 0
to 0
hand 0
over 0
negative 0
information 0
about 0
Democratic 0
presidential 0
nominee 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

The 0
session 0
also 0
was 0
attended 0
by 0
then-campaign 0
chairman 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
and 0
Trump 0
son-in-law 0
Jared 0
Kushner; 0
the 1
president 1
dictated 1
a 1
misleading 1
statement 1
about 1
it 1
a 1
year 1
later 1
and 1
it 1
remains 1
murky 1
just 1
when 1
he 1
learned 1
about 1
the 1
meeting. 1

As 0
Roll 0
Call 0
has 0
reported, 0
Trump 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
tower 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
session 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 0
lawyer. 0

The 0
president 0
also 0
continued 0
to 0
push 0
a 0
line 0
first 1
floated 1
by 0
his 0
attorney, 0
former 0
New 0
York 0
mayor 0
and 0
U.S. 0
attorney 0
Rudolph 0
Giuliani, 0
tweeting 0
that 0
campaign 0
collusion 0
with 0
Russia 0
would 0
be 0
a 1
“phony 1
crime.” 1
He’s 0
right, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
specific 0
collusion 0
statute. 0

But 1
legal 1
experts 1
say 1
anyone 1
in 1
Trump’s 1
orbit 1
would 1
be 1
charged 1
with 1
conspiracy, 1
making 1
false 1
statements 1
to 1
federal 1
investigators 1
or 1
obstructing 1
justice. 1

All 1
are 1
federal 1
crimes. 1

Trump 1
also 1
continued 1
to 1
cast 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
victim 1
in 1
the 1
matter, 1
saying 1
when 1
he 1
attempts 1
to 1
“FIGHT 1
BACK 1
or 1
say 1
anything 1
bad 1
about 1
the 1
Rigged 1
Witch 1
Hunt,” 1
his 1
critics 1
“scream 1
Obstruction!” 1

Mueller 0
also 0
is 0
looking 0
at 0
whether 0
some 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
actions 0
like 0
firing 0
then-FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
B. 0
Comey 0
or 0
statements 0
about 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe 0
since 0
taking 0
office 0
amount 0
to 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
interfere 0
illegally 0
with 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
probe. 0
