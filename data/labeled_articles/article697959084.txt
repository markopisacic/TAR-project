In 0 23 1

another 0 23 1
astonishing 1 23 1
eyewitness 1 23 1

the 0 23 1
worst 0 23 1
mass 0 23 1

in 0 23 1
American 0 23 1

a 0 23 1

who 0 23 1

that 0 23 1
there 0 23 1

inside 0 23 1
the 0 23 1

During 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
confessional, 0 23 2
a 0 23 2
Canadian 0 23 2
man 0 23 2
by 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
name 0 23 2
of 0 23 2
Jeff 0 23 2
detailed 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
fact 0 23 2
that 0 23 2
he 0 23 2
and 0 23 2
his 0 23 2
wife 0 23 2
were 0 23 2
in 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
Bellagio 0 23 2
Resort 0 23 2
and 0 23 2
Casino 0 23 2
around 0 23 2
11:20pm 0 23 2
on 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
night 0 23 2
of 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
shooting 0 23 2
when 0 23 2
panic 0 23 2
broke 0 23 2
out 0 23 2
in 0 23 2
the 0 23 2
hotels 0 23 2
lobby. 0 23 2

Jeff 0 23 3
begins 0 23 3
the 0 23 3
interview 0 23 3
by 0 23 3
making 0 23 3
clear 0 23 3
his 0 23 3
belief 0 23 3
that 0 23 3
there 0 23 3
were 0 23 3
multiple 0 23 3
active 0 23 3
shooters 0 23 3
targeting 0 23 3
different 0 23 3
places 0 23 3
in 0 23 3
Las 0 23 3
Vegas 0 23 3
on 0 23 3
the 0 23 3
night 0 23 3
of 0 23 3
the 0 23 3
attack. 0 23 3

“First 0 23 4
of 0 23 4
all, 0 23 4
I 0 23 4
think 0 23 4
what 0 23 4
needs 0 23 4
to 0 23 4
be 0 23 4
said 0 23 4
is 0 23 4
that, 0 23 4
from 0 23 4
my 0 23 4
perspective, 0 23 4
there 0 23 4
were 0 23 4
multiple 0 23 4
events 0 23 4
that 0 23 4
occurred 0 23 4
around 0 23 4
Las 0 23 4
Vegas, 0 23 4
up 0 23 4
and 0 23 4
down 0 23 4
the 0 23 4
Strip 0 23 4
that 0 23 4
night. 0 23 4

It 0 23 5
wasn’t 0 23 5
just 0 23 5
centralized 0 23 5
around 0 23 5
the 0 23 5
Mandalay 0 23 5
Hotel,” 0 23 5
the 0 23 5
witness 0 23 5
claimed. 0 23 5

The 0 23 6
eyewitness 0 23 6
then 0 23 6
goes 0 23 6
on 0 23 6
to 0 23 6
directly 0 23 6
say 0 23 6
that 0 23 6
he 0 23 6
and 0 23 6
his 0 23 6
wife 0 23 6
were 0 23 6
involved 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
an 0 23 6
active 0 23 6
shooter 0 23 6
situation 0 23 6
at 0 23 6
a 0 23 6
different 0 23 6
hotel 0 23 6
that 0 23 6
authorities 0 23 6
have 0 23 6
so 0 23 6
far 0 23 6
done 0 23 6
everything 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
their 0 23 6
power 0 23 6
to 0 23 6
cover-up. 0 23 6

“My 0 23 7
wife 0 23 7
and 0 23 7
I 0 23 7
were 0 23 7
in 0 23 7
Las 0 23 7
Vegas 0 23 7
celebrating 0 23 7
our 0 23 7
10th 0 23 7
anniversary 0 23 7
and 0 23 7
on 0 23 7
October 0 23 7
1st 0 23 7
we 0 23 7
were 0 23 7
involved 0 23 7
in 0 23 7
an 0 23 7
incident 0 23 7
with 0 23 7
an 0 23 7
active 0 23 7
shooter 0 23 7
at 0 23 7
the 0 23 7
Bellagio. 0 23 7

There 0 23 8
is 0 23 8
no 0 23 8
mistake 0 23 8
in 0 23 8
my 0 23 8
mind 0 23 8
about 0 23 8
it,” 0 23 8
he 0 23 8
continued. 0 23 8

Jeff 0 23 9
then 0 23 9
describes 0 23 9
a 0 23 9
scene 0 23 9
in 0 23 9
which 0 23 9
he 0 23 9
and 0 23 9
his 0 23 9
wife 0 23 9
were 0 23 9
walking 0 23 9
through 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
main 0 23 9
lobby 0 23 9
when 0 23 9
screams 0 23 9
and 0 23 9
gunfire 0 23 9
erupted. 0 23 9

Keep 1 23 10
in 1 23 10
mind, 1 23 10
this 1 23 10
is 1 23 10
all 1 23 10
information 1 23 10
that 1 23 10
the 1 23 10
police 1 23 10
and 1 23 10
the 1 23 10
FBI 1 23 10
has 1 23 10
hidden 1 23 10
from 1 23 10
the 1 23 10
American 1 23 10
people. 1 23 10

“All 0 23 11
of 0 23 11
a 0 23 11
sudden 0 23 11
there 0 23 11
was 0 23 11
just 0 23 11
a 0 23 11
crescendo 0 23 11
of 0 23 11
screams 0 23 11
that 0 23 11
started 0 23 11
behind 0 23 11
us 0 23 11
in 0 23 11
the 0 23 11
lobby,” 0 23 11
he 0 23 11
claimed. 0 23 11

“Then 0 23 12
I 0 23 12
heard 0 23 12
somebody 0 23 12
yell 0 23 12
‘there’s 0 23 12
a 0 23 12
shooter! 0 23 12

There’s 0 23 13
a 0 23 13
shooter!’ 0 23 13
And 0 23 13
then 0 23 13
I 0 23 13
heard 0 23 13
like 0 23 13
five 0 23 13
or 0 23 13
six 0 23 13
pops, 0 23 13
like 0 23 13
unmistakable 0 23 13
gunfire, 0 23 13
unmistakably.” 0 23 13

“That 0 23 14
was 0 23 14
about 0 23 14
11:20 0 23 14
when 0 23 14
we 0 23 14
heard 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
shots 0 23 14
and 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
screams… 0 23 14
at 0 23 14
that 0 23 14
point 0 23 14
you 0 23 14
could 0 23 14
hear 0 23 14
and 0 23 14
see 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
screams 0 23 14
and 0 23 14
see 0 23 14
hundreds 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
people 0 23 14
coming 0 23 14
towards 0 23 14
us.” 0 23 14

Amazingly, 0 23 15
as 0 23 15
Shepard 0 23 15
Ambellas 0 23 15
noted, 0 23 15
“The 0 23 15
man’s 0 23 15
claims 0 23 15
match 0 23 15
up 0 23 15
to 0 23 15
actual 0 23 15
events 0 23 15
captured 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
police 0 23 15
audio 0 23 15
recordings 0 23 15
from 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
night 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
shooting 0 23 15
which 0 23 15
confirms 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
between 0 23 15
11:15 0 23 15
and 0 23 15
11:18 0 23 15
p.m. 0 23 15
on 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
night 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
Oct. 0 23 15
1 0 23 15
there 0 23 15
was, 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
fact, 0 23 15
something 0 23 15
going 0 23 15
on 0 23 15
at 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
Bellagio.” 0 23 15

This 0 23 16
testimony 0 23 16
also 0 23 16
backs 0 23 16
up 0 23 16
claims 0 23 16
by 0 23 16
another 0 23 16
eyewitness, 0 23 16
Rene 0 23 16
Downs, 0 23 16
who 0 23 16
has 0 23 16
spent 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
past 0 23 16
few 0 23 16
days 0 23 16
doing 0 23 16
interviews 0 23 16
about 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
shooter 0 23 16
inside 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Bellagio 0 23 16
Hotel. 0 23 16

Slowly 1 23 17
but 1 23 17
surely 1 23 17
we 0 23 17
are 0 23 17
starting 0 23 17
to 0 23 17
see 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
official 0 23 17
narrative 0 23 17
regarding 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Las 0 23 17
Vegas 0 23 17
Massacre 0 23 17
be 0 23 17
completely 0 23 17
destroyed. 0 23 17

At 0 23 18
this 0 23 18
point 0 23 18
it 1 23 18
is 1 23 18
strikingly 1 23 18
obvious 1 23 18
that 1 23 18
authorities 1 23 18
have 1 23 18
lied 1 23 18
to 1 23 18
the 1 23 18
American 1 23 18
people 1 23 18
about 0 23 18
the 0 23 18
worst 0 23 18
mass 0 23 18
shooting 0 23 18
in 0 23 18
our 0 23 18
countries 0 23 18
history. 0 23 18

One 1 23 19
can 1 23 19
only 1 23 19
speculate 1 23 19
as 1 23 19
to 1 23 19
what 1 23 19
the 1 23 19
reasons 1 23 19
for 1 23 19
these 1 23 19
lies 1 23 19
actually 1 23 19
are? 1 23 19
