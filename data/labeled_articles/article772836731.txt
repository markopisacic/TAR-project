determined 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
world 0

to 0

that 0
Hillary 0

the 0

election 0
fair 1

The 0
Democratic 0

was 0
totally 1
corrupted 1
by 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Regime, 0
and 0
now 0
it 0

totally 1

Leaders 0

my 0

reduce 0
the 0

that 0

Clinton, 0
George 0

created 0
between 0

Yes, 0
Russia 0
is 0
a 0
superpower. 1

Russian 1

are 1
so 1
superior 1
to 1
the 1
junk 1
produced 1
by 1
the 1

if 1
the 1

amplified 0
by 0

senators 0

representatives 0
that 0
the 1
insouciant 1
American 1
voters 1
think 0
that 0

Do 0
you 0
know 0
how 0
large 0
1,000 0

is? 0

You 0
would 0
have 0
to 0

It 0

that 0
nurtures 0
the 0
recipients, 0
and 0
the 0
recipients 0
regard 0
it 0
as 0
worth 0

Therefore, 0
the 0
American 0
public 0
gets 0
not 0
representation, 0
but 0
lies 0
that 0
justify 0
war 0
and 0

about 0
which 0
President 0

warned 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
to 0
no 0

is 0
in 0
desperate 0
need 0
of 0
an 0

In 0
obedience 0

the 0

complex, 0
the 0
Clinton, 0
George 0

during 0
the 0
last 0
half 0
of 0
the 0
1970s 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
member 0
of 0

I 0
was 0
working 0

with 0
a 0
staffer 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Republican 0
Senator 0
from 0
California, 0
S. 0
I. 0
Hayakawa, 0

the 0

that 0
threatened 0

ability 0
to 0
meet 0
its 0

Republican 0
Senators 0
Hatch, 0
Roth, 0
and 0
Hayakawa 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
introduce 0
a 0
supply-side 0
economic 0
policy 0
as 0
a 0
cure 0
for 0
the 0
stagflation 0
that 0
was 0
threatening 0
the 0
US 0
economy 0
with 0
failure. 0

The 0
Democrats, 0
who 0
later 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
led 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
a 0
supply-side 0
policy, 0
were, 0
at 0
this 0
time, 0
opposed 0
(see 0
Paul 0
Craig 0
Roberts, 0
The 0
Supply-Side 0
Revolution, 0
Harvard 0
University 0
Press, 0
1984). 0

The 0
Democrats 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
policy 0
would 0
worsen 0
the 0
budget 0
deficit, 0
the 0
only 0
time 0
in 0
those 0
days 0
Democrats 0
cared 0
about 0
the 0
budget 0
deficit. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
said 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
support 0
the 0
tax 0
rate 0
reductions 0
if 0
the 0
Republicans 0
would 0
support 0
offsetting 0
cuts 0
in 0
the 0
budget 0
to 0
support 0
a 0
balanced 0
budget. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
ploy 0
to 0
put 0
Republicans 0
on 0
the 0
spot 0
for 0
taking 0
away 0
some 0
groups’ 0
handouts 0
in 0
order 0
“to 0
cut 0
tax 0
rates 0
for 0
the 0
rich.” 0

The 0
supply-side 0
policy 0
did 0
not 0
require 0
budget 0
cuts, 0
but 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
the 0
Democrats 0
lack 0
of 0
sincerety, 0
Hayakawa’s 0
aid 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
our 0
senators 0
introduce 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
budget 0
cuts 0
together 0
with 0
tax 0
cuts 0
that, 0
on 0
a 0
static 0
revenue 0
basis 0
(not 0
counting 0
tax 0
revenue 0
feedbacks 0
from 0
the 0
incentives 0
of 0
the 0
lower 0
tax 0
rates) 0
kept 0
the 0
budget 0
even, 0
and 0
the 0
Democrats 0
voted 0
against 0
them 0
every 0
time. 0

When 0
the 0
combination 0
of 0
tax 0
cuts 0
with 0
defense 0
budget 0
cuts 0
came 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
vote, 0
the 1
legendary 1
senator 1
Strom 0
Thurmond, 0
a 0
48-year 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Senate 0
from 0
South 0
Carolina, 0
tapped 0
me 0
on 0
the 0
shoulder. 0

He 0
said: 0
“son, 1
never 1
set 1
your 1
senator 1
up 1
against 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex. 1

He 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
re-elected, 1
and 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
job.” 1
I 0
replied 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
just 0
establishing 0
for 0
the 0
record 0
that 0
under 0
no 0
conditions 0
would 0
the 0
Democrats, 0
who 0
wanted 0
more 0
government, 0
vote 0
for 0
a 0
tax 0

reduction 0
even 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
case 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
cure 0
stagflation. 0

He 0
replied: 0
“son, 0
the 1
military/security 1
complex 1
doesn’t 1
care.” 1

My 0
emergence 1
from 1
The 1
Matrix 1
began 0
with 0
Thurmond’s 0
pat 0
on 0
my 0
shoulder. 0

It 0
grew 0
with 0
my 0
time 0
at 0
the 0
Wall 0
Street 0
Journal 0
when 0
I 0
learned 0
that 0
some 0
truthful 0
things 0
simply 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
said. 0

In 0
the 0
Treasury 0
I 0
experienced 0
how 0
those 0
outside 0
interests 0
opposed 0
to 0
a 0
president’s 0
policy 0
marshall 1
their 1
forces 1
and 0
the 0
media 0
that 0
they 0
own 0
to 0
block 0
it. 0

Later 0
as 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
secret 0
presidential 0
committee, 0
I 0
saw 0
how 0
the 0
CIA 0
attempted 0
to 0
prevent 0
President 0
Reagan 0
from 0
ending 0
the 0
Cold 0
War. 0

Today, 1
right 1
now, 1
at 1
this 1
moment, 1
we 1
are 1
faced 1
with 1
a 1
massive 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex, 1
the 1
neoconservatives, 1
the 1
Democratic 1
Party, 1
and 1
the 1
presstitute 1
media 1
to 1
discredit 1
the 1
elected 1
President 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
and 1
to 1
overthrow 1
him 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
the 1
utterly 1
corrupt 1
elite 1
that 1
rule 1
American 1
can 1
continue 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
power 1
and 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
massive 1
budget 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex 1
that, 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
Israel 1
Lobby, 1
funds 1
the 1
elections 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
rule 1
us. 1

Trump, 0

was 0
an 0
exception, 0
and 0
it 0
is 0

that 0
accumulate 0
the 0
ire 0
of 0

leftwing, 0
bought 0
off 0

and 0
the 1
ire 1
of 1
the 1

concentrated 0
into 0
small 0
tight 0

those 0
who 0
permitted 0

illegal 0

Here 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
clued-in 0
Russian 0
Defense 0
Minister 0
Shoigu 0
has 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 1
aggressive 1
actions 1
of 1

against 1

If 0

doesn’t 0
listen 0

Russia 0
is 0
in 1
the 1
trash 1

Keep 1
in 1
mind 1
that 1
no 1
media 1
informs 1
you 1
better 1
than 1
my 1
website. 1

If 0
my 0
website 0
goes 0
down, 0
you 0
will 0
be 0
left 0
in 0
darkness. 0

No 1
valid 1
information 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
US 1

or 1

If 1
you 1
sit 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
TV 1
screen 1
watching 1
the 1
Western 1

you 1
are 1

beyond 1
all 1
hope. 1

Not 1
even 1
I 1
can 1
rescue 1
you. 1

Nor 1
God 1
himself. 1

Americans, 0
and 0
indeed 0
the 0
Russians 0
themselves, 0
are 0
incapable 0
of 0
realizing 0
it, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
chance 0
that 0
Trump 0
will 0
be 0
overthrown 0
and 0
a 0
Western 0
assault 0
will 0
be 0
launched 0
against 0
the 0
handful 0
of 0
countries 0
that 0
insist 0
on 0
sovereignty. 0

I 1
doubt 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
Americans 1
who 1
elected 1
Trump 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
anti-Trump 1
propagana, 1
but 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
organized 0
and 0
have 0
no 0
armed 0
power. 0

The 0
police, 0
militarized 0
by 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
Obama, 0
will 0
be 0
set 0
against 0
them. 0

The 0
rebellions 0
will 0
be 0
local 0
and 0
suppressed 0
by 0
every 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Constitution 0
by 0
the 0
private 0
powers 0
that 0
rule 0
Washington, 0
as 0
always 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
case 0
with 0
rebellions 0
in 0
America. 0

In 1
the 1
West, 1
which 1
the 1
Russians 1
are 1
so 1
anxious 1
to 1
join, 1
all 1
freedoms 1
are 1
dead—freedom 0
of 0
assembly, 0
freedom 0
of 0
speech, 0
freedom 0
of 0
association, 0
freedom 0
of 0
inquiry, 0
freedom 0
of 0
privacy, 0
freedom 0
from 0
arbitrary 0
search, 0
freedom 1
from 0
arbitrary 0
arrest, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
Constitutional 0
protections 0
of 0
due 0
process 0
and 0
habeas 0
corpus. 0

Today 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
countries 1
less 1
free 1
than 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
of 1
America. 1

Why 0
do 0
the 0
Russian 0
Atlanticist 0
Integrationists 0
want 0
to 0
join 0
an 0
unfree 0
Western 0
world? 0

Are 0
they 0
that 0
brainwashed 1
by 0
Western 0
Propaganda? 0

If 0
Putin 0
listens 0
to 0
these 0
deluded 1
fools, 1
Putin 0
will 0
destroy 0
Russia. 0

There 0
is 0
something 0
wrong 0
with 0
Russian 0
perception 0
of 0
Washington. 0

Apparently 0
the 0
Russian 0
elite, 0
with 0
the 0
exception 0
of 0
Shoigu 0
and 0
a 0
few 0
others 0
are 0
incapable 0
of 0
comprehending 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
drive 0
for 0
US 0
world 0
hegemony 0
and 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
determination 0
to 0
destroy 0
Russia 0
as 0
a 0
constraint 0
on 0
US 0
unilateralism. 0

The 0
Russian 0
government 0
somehow, 0
despite 0
all 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary, 0
believes 0
that 0
Washington’s 0
hegemony 0
is 0
negotiable. 0
