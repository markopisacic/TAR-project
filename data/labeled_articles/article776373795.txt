WASHINGTON 0
— 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
called 0
on 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
to 0
“stop 0
this 1
Rigged 1
Witch 1
Hunt 1
right 0
now,” 0
opening 0
the 0
president 0
to 0
further 0
complaints 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
trying 0
to 0
obstruct 0
the 0
investigation 0
into 0
Russia’s 0
election 0
interference 0
and 0
his 0
campaign’s 0
possible 0
complicity. 0

Trump 0
is 0
already 0
reportedly 0
under 0
investigation 0
for 0
potential 0
obstruction 0
of 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe 0
led 0
by 0
special 0
counsel 0
Robert 0
S. 0
Mueller 0
III. 0

The 0
tweet 0
early 0
Wednesday 0
was 0
the 1
president’s 1
most 1
explicit 1
post 1
or 1
statement 1
to 1
date 1
seemingly 0
aimed 0
at 0
getting 0
his 0
attorney 0
general, 0
the 0
nation’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officer, 0
to 0
end 0
the 0
probe 0

The 0
tweet, 0
along 0
with 0
several 0
others 0
Wednesday 0
morning, 0
accelerated 0
the 0
president’s 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
investigation, 0
which 0
he 0
claims 0
is 0
tainted 1
by 1
bias. 1

They 0
were 0
likely 0
prompted 0
by 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
the 0
trial 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
of 0
Paul 0
Manafort, 0
Trump’s 0
former 0
campaign 0
chairman, 0
on 0
18 0
charges 0
of 0
tax 0
evasion, 0
bank 0
fraud 0
and 0
conspiracy. 0

“This 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
situation 1
and 1
Attorney 1
General 1
Jeff 1
Sessions 1
should 1
stop 1
this 1
Rigged 1
Witch 1
Hunt 1
right 1
now, 1
before 1
it 1
continues 1
to 1
stain 1
our 1
country 1
any 1
further. 1

Bob 1
Mueller 1
is 1
totally 1
conflicted, 1
and 1
his 1
17 1
Angry 1
Democrats 1
that 1
are 1
doing 1
his 1
dirty 1
work 1
are 1
a 1
disgrace 1
to 1
USA!” 1
Trump 0
wrote. 0

The 0
president 0
suggested 0
in 0
a 0
subsequent 0
tweet 0
that 0
Manafort 1
was 1
being 1
treated 1
worse 1
than 1
Al 1
Capone, 1
the 1
notorious 1
Prohibition-era 1
Chicago 1
gangster. 1

“Where 0
is 0
the 0
Russian 0
Collusion?” 0
Trump 0
added. 0

Trump’s 0
tweets 0
prompted 0
Rep. 0
Adam 0
B. 0
Schiff 0
of 0
California, 0
the 0
top 0
Democrat 0
on 0
the 0
House 0
Intelligence 0
Committee, 0
to 0
accuse 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
obstruction 0
“hiding 1
in 1
plain 1
sight.” 1

“The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
just 0
called 0
on 0
his 0
Attorney 0
General 0
to 0
put 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
an 0
investigation 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
President, 0

Schiff 0
tweeted. 0

“This 1
is 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
obstruct 1
justice 1
hiding 1
in 1
plain 1
sight. 1

America 1
must 1
never 1

it.” 1

Although 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
said 0
that 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
are 0
official 0
presidential 0
statements, 0
his 0
lawyer, 0
Rudolph 0
W. 0
Giuliani, 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
latest 0
one 0
as 0
he 0
has 0
before, 0
by 0
brushing 0
off 0
suggestions 0
that 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
as 0
evidence 0
of 0
obstruction. 0

“The 0
president 0
was 0
expressing 0
his 0
opinion 0
on 0
his 0
favored 0
medium 0
for 0
asserting 0
his 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right 0
of 0
free 0
speech,” 0
Giuliani 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
interview. 0

“He 0
said 0
‘should,’ 0
not 0
‘must,’ 0
and 0
no 0
presidential 0
order 0
was 0
issued 0
or 0
will 0
be.” 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
spoke 0
with 0
Trump 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
wasn’t 0
actually 0
issuing 0
an 0
order. 0

“I 0
talked 0
to 0
him 0
about 0
it 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
same 0
page 0
as 0
we 0
are,” 0
Giuliani 0
said, 0
and 0
the 0
president 0
indicated 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
ordering 0
Sessions 0
to 0
act. 0

On 0
Sunday, 0
Giuliani 0
told 0
CBS’ 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation”: 0
“Obstruction 0
by 0
tweet 0
is 0
not 0
something 0
I 0
think 0
works 0
real 0
well. 0

Generally 0
obstruction 0
is 0
secret, 0
it’s 0
clandestine, 0
it’s 0
corrupt.” 0

Giuliani 0
added, 0
“I’ve 1
looked 1
at 1
all 1
those 1
tweets 1
and 1
they 1
don’t 1
amount 1
to 1
anything.” 1

For 0
months, 0
Trump’s 0
lawyers 0
also 0
have 0
argued 0
that 0
it’s 0
impossible 0
for 0
the 0
president 0
to 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
because 0
his 0
constitutional 0
authority 0
extends 0
over 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

That 0
power 0
allows 0
him 0
to 0
direct 0
officials 0
where 0
to 0
focus 0
their 0
resources 0
or 0
to 0
fire 0
them 0
when 0
he 0
chooses, 0
as 0
Trump 0
did 0
when 0
removing 0
James 0
B. 0
Comey 0
as 0
FBI 0
director 0
last 0
year. 0

That 0
firing, 0
however, 0
led 0
to 0
Mueller’s 0
appointment 0
as 0
special 0
counsel. 0

Wednesday’s 0
tweet 0
was 0
a 0
reminder 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
unabated 1
anger 1
at 0
Sessions, 0
who 0
recused 0
himself 0
from 0
overseeing 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
on 0
March 0
2, 0
2017 0
— 0
as 0
members 0
of 0
both 0
parties 0
and 0
legal 0
experts 0
have 0
contended 0
that 0
he 0
should. 0

Sessions 0
pointed 0
to 0
Justice 0
Department 0
regulations 0
to 0
explain 0
that, 0
as 0
one 1
of 1
Trump’s 1
earliest 1
and 1
most 1
active 1
supporters, 1
he 0
shouldn’t 0
participate 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign. 0

He 0
announced 0
the 0
decision 0
after 0
controversy 0
over 0
his 0
own 0
undisclosed 0
contacts, 0
both 0
during 0
the 0
campaign 0
and 0
the 0
post-election 0
transition, 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 0
ambassador 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
Sergey 0
Kislyak. 0

Two 1
months 1
ago, 1
Trump 1
tweeted 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
chosen 1
a 1
different 1
person 1
as 1
attorney 1
general 1
who 1
wouldn’t 1
have 1
needed 1
to 1
recuse 1
himself. 1

“I 1
wish 1
I 1
did!” 1
he 1
wrote. 1

In 1
his 1
tweets, 1
Trump 1
also 1
quoted 1
criticism 1
of 1
the 1
investigation 1
from 1
Alan 1
Dershowitz, 1
a 1
Harvard 1
Law 1
School 1
professor 1
who 1
frequently 1
defends 1
Trump 1
on 1
television. 1

In 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
the 1
Los 1
Angeles 1
Times, 1
Dershowitz 1
said 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
believe 1
Sessions 1
has 1
the 1
authority 1
to 1
end 1
the 1
probe. 1

“You 1
can’t 1
be 1
both 1
recused 1
and 1
making 1
decisions 1
about 1
the 1
investigation,” 1
he 1
said. 1

But 0
Dershowitz 0
also 0
cast 0
doubt 0
on 0
whether 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
obstruction. 0

“You 0
cannot 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
by 0
openly 0
exercising 0
your 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
and 0
openly 0
criticizing 0
a 0
prosecution, 0
whether 0
you’re 0
right 0
or 0
wrong,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Obstruction 0
of 0
justice 0
is 0
generally 0
committed 0
behind 0
the 0
scenes, 0
so 0
I 0
think 0
both 0
sides 0
are 0
a 0
little 0
overwrought 0
here.” 0

Stephen 0
Vladeck, 0
a 0
University 0
of 0
Texas 0
law 0
professor, 0
agreed 0
that 0
Sessions 0
cannot 0
stop 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
given 0
that 0
he 0
recused 0
himself. 0

“The 0
president, 0
intentionally 0
or 0
not, 0
is 0
misdirecting 1
his 1
ire,” 1
Vladeck 0
said. 0

If 0
Trump 0
wanted 0
to 0
use 0
his 0
power 0
to 0
end 0
the 0
probe, 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
order 0
to 0
Rod 0
J. 0
Rosenstein, 0
the 0
deputy 0
attorney 0
general 0
supervising 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team’s 0
work, 0
and 0
fire 0
Rosenstein 0
if 0
he 0
does 0
not 0
comply, 0
according 0
to 0
Vladeck. 0

Trump 0
could 0
also 0
try 0
to 0
replace 0
Sessions 0
as 0
attorney 0
general 0
with 0
someone 0
who 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
a 0
conflict 0
of 0
interest 0
from 0
the 0
campaign, 0
allowing 0
that 0
person 0
to 0
relieve 0
Rosenstein 0
of 0
the 0
responsibility 0
to 0
oversee 0
Mueller, 0
Vladeck 0
said. 0
