Rep. 0 200 2
Ron 0 200 2
DeSantis 0 200 2
(R-FL) 0 200 2
accuses 0 200 2
the 0 200 2
Republican 0 200 2
House 0 200 2
leadership 0 200 2
of 0 200 2
dragging 0 200 2
their 0 200 2
heels 0 200 2
in 0 200 2
the 0 200 2
Spygate 0 200 2
investigation. 0 200 2

This 0 200 3
has 0 200 3
been 0 200 3
evident 0 200 3
for 0 200 3
months 0 200 3
now, 0 200 3
as 0 200 3
there 0 200 3
are 0 200 3
many 0 200 3
connections 0 200 3
and 0 200 3
obvious 0 200 3
questions 0 200 3
that 0 200 3
haven’t 0 200 3
been 0 200 3
investigated. 0 200 3

The 0 200 4
FBI 0 200 4
files 0 200 4
contain 0 200 4
memos 0 200 4
that 0 200 4
need 0 200 4
to 0 200 4
be 0 200 4
scoured 0 200 4
too. 0 200 4

The 0 200 5
House 0 200 5
leaders 0 200 5
are 0 200 5
Paul 0 200 5
Ryan 0 200 5
(Speaker 0 200 5
of 0 200 5
the 0 200 5
House), 0 200 5
Kevin 0 200 5
McCarthy 0 200 5
(Majority 0 200 5
Leader), 0 200 5
Steve 0 200 5
Scalise 0 200 5
(Majority 0 200 5
Whip) 0 200 5
and 0 200 5
Cathy 0 200 5
McMorris 0 200 5
Rodgers 0 200 5
(House 0 200 5
Republican 0 200 5
Conference 0 200 5
Chair). 0 200 5

There 0 200 6
is 0 200 6
a 0 200 6
decided 0 200 6
lack 0 200 6
of 0 200 6
aggressiveness 0 200 6
of 0 200 6
this 0 200 6
investigation. 0 200 6

One 0 200 7
source 0 200 7
is 0 200 7
Paul 0 200 7
Ryan: 0 200 7
Evidence: 0 200 7
“House 0 200 7
Speaker 0 200 7
Paul 0 200 7
Ryan 0 200 7
said 0 200 7
Wednesday 0 200 7
that 0 200 7
Oversight 0 200 7
Chairman 0 200 7
Trey 0 200 7
Gowdy 0 200 7
was 0 200 7
‘accurate’ 0 200 7
when 0 200 7
he 0 200 7
argued 0 200 7
the 0 200 7
FBI 0 200 7
has 0 200 7
acted 0 200 7
appropriately 0 200 7
in 0 200 7
its 0 200 7
ongoing 0 200 7
probe 0 200 7
of 0 200 7
potential 0 200 7
Russian 0 200 7
links 0 200 7
to 0 200 7
the 0 200 7
Trump 0 200 7
campaign.” 0 200 7
How 1 200 7
could 1 200 7
Ryan 1 200 7
possibly 1 200 7
know 1 200 7
this? 1 200 7

Isn’t 1 200 8
he 1 200 8
prejudging 1 200 8
the 1 200 8
case 1 200 8
without 1 200 8
even 1 200 8
finding 1 200 8
out 1 200 8
what 1 200 8
actually 1 200 8
happened? 1 200 8

If 0 200 9
Ryan 0 200 9
is 0 200 9
correct, 0 200 9
an 0 200 9
investigation 0 200 9
will 0 200 9
show 0 200 9
it; 0 200 9
but 0 200 9
the 0 200 9
current 0 200 9
evidence 0 200 9
suggests 0 200 9
he 0 200 9
is 0 200 9
wrong. 0 200 9

By 0 200 10
short-circuiting 0 200 10
the 0 200 10
investigation, 0 200 10
Ryan 0 200 10
is 0 200 10
betraying 1 200 10
the 1 200 10
interest 1 200 10
of 1 200 10
the 1 200 10
American 1 200 10
people 1 200 10
to 0 200 10
learn 0 200 10
what 0 200 10
the 0 200 10
FBI 0 200 10
and 0 200 10
CIA 0 200 10
actually 0 200 10
did 0 200 10
against 0 200 10
Trump. 0 200 10

Another 0 200 11
Republican 0 200 11
who 0 200 11
wants 0 200 11
to 0 200 11
stop 0 200 11
investigating 0 200 11
is 0 200 11
former 0 200 11
RNC 0 200 11
Chair, 0 200 11
Michael 0 200 11
Steele: 0 200 11
“There 0 200 11
is 0 200 11
no 0 200 11
Spygate 0 200 11
because 0 200 11
there 0 200 11
are 0 200 11
no 0 200 11
spies 0 200 11
in 0 200 11
the 0 200 11
campaign.” 0 200 11
The 0 200 11
attitude 0 200 11
of 0 200 11
Steve 0 200 11
Scalise 0 200 11
is 0 200 11
wishy-washy. 1 200 11

He’s 0 200 12
open 0 200 12
to 0 200 12
a 0 200 12
special 0 200 12
prosecutor, 0 200 12
but 0 200 12
his 0 200 12
responses 0 200 12
come 0 200 12
across 0 200 12
as 0 200 12
passive, 0 200 12
lacking 1 200 12
push, 1 200 12
zeal 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
enthusiasm 1 200 12
to 0 200 12
delve 0 200 12
deeply 0 200 12
into 0 200 12
Spygate. 0 200 12

There 0 200 13
is 0 200 13
a 0 200 13
kind 0 200 13
of 0 200 13
coverup 0 200 13
at 0 200 13
work 0 200 13
here 0 200 13
in 0 200 13
which 0 200 13
important 0 200 13
Republicans 0 200 13
do 0 200 13
not 0 200 13
want 0 200 13
to 0 200 13
bolster 0 200 13
Trump 0 200 13
by 0 200 13
adding 0 200 13
substance 0 200 13
to 0 200 13
Spygate, 0 200 13
and 0 200 13
they 0 200 13
do 0 200 13
not 0 200 13
want 0 200 13
to 0 200 13
clean 0 200 13
up 0 200 13
the 0 200 13
FBI 0 200 13
by 0 200 13
aggressively 0 200 13
investigating 0 200 13
Spygate 0 200 13
further. 0 200 13

They 0 200 14
don’t 0 200 14
want 0 200 14
the 1 200 14
rotten 1 200 14
inner 1 200 14
workings 1 200 14
of 0 200 14
the 0 200 14
organization 0 200 14
to 0 200 14
be 0 200 14
aired 0 200 14
publicly. 0 200 14

They 1 200 15
want 1 200 15
to 1 200 15
preserve 1 200 15
the 1 200 15
FBI’s 1 200 15
reputation. 1 200 15

They 1 200 16
don’t 1 200 16
care 1 200 16
to 1 200 16
see 1 200 16
Trump 1 200 16
vindicated. 1 200 16

The 0 200 17
contrast 0 200 17
with 0 200 17
the 0 200 17
Watergate 0 200 17
investigation 0 200 17
and 0 200 17
hearings 0 200 17
is 0 200 17
startling. 1 200 17
