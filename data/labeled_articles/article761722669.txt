President 0 274 38
Johnson 0 274 38
should 0 274 38
have 0 274 38
resigned? 0 274 38

Someone 0 274 39
should 0 274 39
ask 0 274 39
you 0 274 39
these 0 274 39
questions 0 274 39
because 0 274 39
of 0 274 39
the 0 274 39
way 0 274 39
you 0 274 39
formulate 0 274 39
the 0 274 39
questions,' 0 274 39
he 0 274 39
jabbed. 0 274 39

'I 0 274 40
dealt 0 274 40
with 0 274 40
it 0 274 40
20 0 274 40
years 0 274 40
ago, 0 274 40
plus.' 0 274 40

Suddenly 0 274 41
philosophical 0 274 41
and 0 274 41
seeming 0 274 41
to 0 274 41
take 0 274 41
a 0 274 41
longer 0 274 41
view 0 274 41
of 0 274 41
history, 0 274 41
Clinton 0 274 41
said: 0 274 41
'I 0 274 41
have 0 274 41
tried 0 274 41
to 0 274 41
do 0 274 41
a 0 274 41
good 0 274 41
job 0 274 41
since 0 274 41
then 0 274 41
with 0 274 41
my 0 274 41
life 0 274 41
and 0 274 41
with 0 274 41
my 0 274 41
work. 0 274 41

That's 0 274 42
all 0 274 42
I 0 274 42
have 0 274 42
to 0 274 42
say 0 274 42

you.' 0 274 42
