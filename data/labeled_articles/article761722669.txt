Former 0
President 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
insisted 0
in 0
a 0
weekend 0
interview 0
that 0
he 0
doesn't 0
owe 0
a 0
personal 0
apology 0
to 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky, 0
the 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
intern 0
whose 0
adult 0
life 0
has 0
been 0
defined 0
by 0
their 0
inappropriate 1
sexual 0
affair 0
and 0
the 0
global 0
scrutiny 0
that 0
followed. 0

'No,' 0
he 0
told 0
NBC 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
airing 0
Monday 0
on 0
the 0
'Today' 0
show. 0

'I 0
do 0
not 0
– 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
talked 0
to 0
her. 0

But 0
I 0
did 0
say 0
publicly 0
on 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
occasion 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
sorry.' 0

'I 0
apologized 0
to 0
everybody 0
in 0
the 0
world,' 0
Clinton 0
said, 0
implying 0
that 0
was 0
enough. 0

And 0
the 0
flustered 0
former 0
president, 0
more 0
famous 0
for 0
his 0
Don 1
Juan-like 1
seductions 1
than 0
for 0
his 0
policy 0
legacy, 0
portrayed 0
himself, 0
not 0
Lewinsky, 0
as 0
history's 0
victim 0
in 0
the 0
mass-media's 0
retelling 0
of 0
the 0
1990s 0

Her 0
too: 0
Lewinsky 0
has 0
emerged 0
as 0
an 0
anti-bullying 0
activist 0
and 0
now 0
says 0
Clinton 0
engaged 0
in 0
a 0
'gross 1
abuse 1
of 1
power' 1
by 0
seducing 0
her 0

'A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
have 0
been 0
omitted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
story 0
work,' 0
he 0
declared, 0
'I 0
think 0
partly 0
because 0
they're 0
frustrated 0
that 0
they 0
got 0
all 0
these 0
serious 0
allegations 0
against 0
the 0
current 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office 0
and 0
his 0
voters 0
don't 0
seem 0
to 0
care.' 0

And 0
Clinton 0
complained 0
in 0
the 0
interview 0
that 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
presidency 0
financially 0
ruined 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
costs 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
legal 0
consequences 0
of 0
his 0
actions. 0

'Nobody 0
believes 0
that 0
I 0
got 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
for 0
free,' 0
he 0
said. 0

'I 0
left 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
$16 0
million 0
in 0
debt,' 0

He's 0
worth 0
about 0
$80 0
million 0
today, 0
aided 0
by 0
an 0
aggressive 0
schedule 0
of 0
speaking 0
events 0
– 0
many 0
of 0
which 0
paid 0
him 0
six-figure 0
fees 0
for 0
individual 0
appearances. 0

In 0
a 0
March 0
essay 0
for 0
Vanity 0
Fair 0
magazine, 0
Lewinsky 0
wrote 0
that 0
'what 0
transpired 0
between 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
and 0
myself 0
was 0
not 0
sexual 1
assault, 1
although 0
we 0
now 0
recognize 0
that 0
it 0
constituted 0
a 0
gross 1
abuse 1
of 1
power.' 1

Clinton 0
is 0
now 0
on 0
a 0
book 0

got 0

questions 0
from 0

in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Monday 0
morning 0

Clinton, 0
pictured 0
denying 0
his 0
May-December 0
affair 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
president, 0
was 0
already 0
noted 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
for 0
his 0
lothario 1
habits 0

But 0
decades 0
later, 0
she's 0
still 0
traumatized 1
by 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
being 0
identifed 0
globally 0
as 0
the 0
your 0
woman 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
kept 0
on 0
the 0
side 0
and 0
used 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
pleasure 0
just 0
a 0
few 0
feet 0
from 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office. 0

'I’m 0
sorry 0
to 0
say 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
a 0
definitive 0
answer 0
yet 0
on 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
events 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
1998 0
investigation,' 0
Lewinsky 0
wrote 0
of 0
the 0
public 1
humiliation 1
that 0
played 0
out 0
in 0
seeming 0
slow 0
motion. 0

'I 0
am 0
unpacking 0
and 0
reprocessing 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
me. 0

Over 0
and 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again.' 0

Clinton 0
is 0
launching 0
a 0
book 0
tour 0
to 0
promote 0
'The 0
President 0

Missing,' 0
a 0
fictional 0
political 0
thriller 0
co-written 0
with 0
the 0
famed 0
author 0
James 0
Patterson. 0

He 0
accused 0
interviewed 0
Craig 0
Melvin 0
of 0
'ignor[ing] 0
gaping 0
facts 0
in 0
describing 0
this, 0
and 0
I 0
bet 0
you 0
don't 0
know 0
you 0
don't 0
know 0
them.' 0

'This 0
was 0
litigated 0
20 0
years 0
ago. 0

Two-thirds 0
of 0
the 1
American 1
people 1
sided 0
with 0
me.' 0

Lewinsky 0
is 0
pictured 0
on 0
September 0

1998 0
meeting 0
with 0
then-president 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
at 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
function 0

If 0
he 0
were 0
president 0
today, 0
he 0
said 0
later, 0
his 0
most 0
famous 0
extramarital 0
affair 0
wouldn't 0
'be 0
an 0
issue, 0
because 0
people 0
would 0
be 0
using 0
the 0
facts 0
instead 0
of 0
the 0
imagined 0
facts.' 0

Patterson, 0
too, 0
defended 0
Clinton 0
– 0
by 0
comparing 0
his 0
sexual 0
affairs 0
in 0
office 0
with 0
those 0
of 0
two 0
preceding 0
Democratic 0
presidents. 0

'It's 0
20 0
years 0
ago, 0
come 0
on!' 0

he 0
blasted 0
Melvin. 0

'Let's 0
talk 0
about 0
JFK. 0

Let's 0
talk 0
about, 0
you 0
know, 0
LBJ. 0

Stop 0
already!' 0

Clinton 0
piled 0
on. 0

'You 0
think 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
should 0
have 0
resigned? 0

Do 0
you 0
believe 0
President 0
Johnson 0
should 0
have 0
resigned? 0

Someone 0
should 0
ask 0
you 0
these 0
questions 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
way 0
you 0
formulate 0
the 0
questions,' 0
he 0
jabbed. 0

'I 0
dealt 0
with 0
it 0
20 0
years 0
ago, 0
plus.' 0

Suddenly 0
philosophical 0
and 0
seeming 0
to 0
take 0
a 0
longer 0
view 0
of 0
history, 0
Clinton 0
said: 0
'I 0
have 0
tried 0
to 0
do 0
a 0
good 0
job 0
since 0
then 0
with 0
my 0
life 0
and 0
with 0
my 0
work. 0

That's 0
all 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
you.' 0
