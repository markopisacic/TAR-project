the 0
Saudis 0
“understand 0
the 0
serious 0
nature” 0
of 0

we 0
ought 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
a 0
few 0
more 0
days 0

than 0
80 0
years. 0

The 0
administration’s 0
reluctance 0
to 0
condemn 0
the 0
Saudi 0
government 0
has 0
fueled 0
criticism 0
from 0
Democrats 0
and 0
Republicans 0
in 0
Congress, 0
from 0
diplomats 0
and 0
from 0
even 0
some 0
corporations 0

profited 0
from 0
close 0
relations 0

royal 0
family. 0

“We 0
just 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
allow 0
the 0

to 0
move 0
forward, 0
allow 0
the 0
facts 0
to 0
unfold,” 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

“And 0
as 0
they 0
unfold, 0
as 0
we 0
make 0
a 0
determination 0
for 0
ourselves 0
about 0
what 0
happened 0
there, 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
facts 0
that 0
are 0
presented 0
to 0
us, 0
the 1
United 1
States 1
will 0
determine 0
what 0
the 0
appropriate 0
response 0
might 0
be.” 0
