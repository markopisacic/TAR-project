Here's 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
was 0
founded 0
to 0
study 0
and 0
preserve 0
Jewish 0
history. 0

These 0
days 0
it’s 0
instead 0
partnering 0

Peace: 0
an 0

Coming 0
up 0
in 0
late 0
October 0
is 0
“The 0
Balfour 0
Declaration: 0
Support 0
for 0
a 0
Jewish 0

The 0

Jonathan 0

for 0
eliminating 0
Israel. 0

He 0
had 0
tweeted, 0
"EU 1
no 1
longer 1

Time 1

In 0
December, 0
the 0
AJHS 0
will 0
feature 0
“Rubble 0
Rubble”, 0
a 0
play 0
by 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
trip 0
to 0
Israel. 0

Fishback 0
is 0
a 0
BDS 0
supporter 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
JVP 0
Artists 0
Council. 0

His 0
goal 0
is 0
to 0
“normalize 0
Jewish 0
anti-Zionism”. 0

AJHS 0

get 0
discounted 0
admission. 0

The 0
JVP 0
events 0
have 0
been 0
canceled 0
That 0
includes 0
Fishback's 0
Rubble 0
and 0
Rubble. 0

And 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
is 0
flooding 0
the 0
media 0
with 0
#BDStears. 0

There's 0
an 0
outbreak 0
of 0
them 0
at 0
anti-Israel 1
hate 0
sites 0
like 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
and 0
the 0
Forward. 0

"I 0
have 0
grown 0
accustomed 0
to 0
feeling 0
unwelcome 0
in 0
Jewish 0
spaces," 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
whines. 0

Him, 0
the 0
PLO 0
and 0
the 0
KKK. 0

"Any 1
Jew 1
who 1
opposes 1
the 1
Occupation 1
— 1
or 1
opposes 1
Zionism 1
itself 1
— 1
knows 1
that 1
feeling 1
of 1
being 1
shunned 1
from 1
the 1
places 1
that 1
are 1
supposed 1
to 1
shelter 1
and 1
nurture 1
you: 1
families, 1
synagogues, 1
community 1
centers, 1
arts 1
organizations," 1
Fishback 0
continues. 0

"I 0
am 0
terrified 1
for 0
the 0
Jewish 0
people. 0

I 0
was 0
raised 0
to 0
believe 0
we 0
were 0
a 0
people 0
of 0
dissent 0
and 0
argument. 0

I 0
was 0
taught 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
important 0
to 0
ask 0
difficult 0
questions, 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
noble 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
for 0
what 0
you 0
believed 0
in. 0

If 1
our 1
Jewish 1
institutions 1
— 1
particularly 1
the 1
American 1
Jewish 1
Historical 1
Society 1
— 1
cannot 1
accommodate 1
dissent, 1
and 1
effectively 1
exclude 1
all 1
Jewish 1
anti-Zionists, 1
then 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
only 1
lost 1
a 1
rapidly 1
growing 1
Jewish 1
population, 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
lost 1
a 1
key 1
aspect 1
of 1
their 1
Jewishness." 1

Let's 0
unpack 0
this 0
knapsack 1
of 1
entitled 1
nonsense. 1

Anti-Israel 0
activists 0
like 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
are 0
entitled 0
to 0
exploit 0
Jewish 0
spaces 0
for 0
their 0
propoaganda... 0
even 0
while 0
they 0
advocate 0
a 0
boycott 0
of 0
the 0
Jews 0
of 0
Israel. 0

Previously 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
had 0
authored 0
an 0
article 0
arguing 0
for 0
boycotting 0
some 0
Israeli 0
plays. 0

Now 0
he's 0
whining 1
that 0
boycotting 0
his 0
play 0
is 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
Jewishness 0
because 0
Jews 0
are 0
a 0
"people 0
of 0
dissent 0
and 0
argument." 0

But 0
the 0
only 0
dissent 0
and 0
argument 0
that 0
Jews 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0
welcome 0
is 0
that 0
of 0
people 1
who 1
hate 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
Jewish 1
nationhood. 1

Not 1
of 1
Jewish 1
nationhood 1
itself. 1

"it’s 0
not 0
that 0
BDS 0
is 0
“censoring” 0
work 0
— 0
it’s 0
that 0
BDS 0
is 0
resisting 0
a 0
propaganda 0
campaign 0
that 0
was 0
intentionally 0
crafted 0
to 0
influence 0
international 0
politics," 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
claimed 0
when 0
advocating 0
a 0
boycott 0
of 0
some 0
Israeli 0
plays. 0

It's 0
not 0
that 0
boycotting 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
censors 0
work. 0

It's 1
resistance 1
to 1
a 1
propaganda 1
campaign 1
intended 1
to 1
attack 1
the 1
human 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
Jewish 1
people. 1

It's 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
#BDStears 0
crowd 0
to 0
examine 0
their 0
entitlement 0
and 0
recognize 0
that 0
what's 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
goose 0
is 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
gander. 0

Either 1
that 1
or 1
they 1
can 1
go 1
whine 1
to 1
the 1
New 1
York 1
Times 1
some 1
more 1
because 1
the 1
Jewish 1
community 1
won't 1
let 1
them 1
burn 1
crosses 1
on 1
their 1
lawn. 1
