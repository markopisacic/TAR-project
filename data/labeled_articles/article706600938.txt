derided 0
by 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentators 0
for 0
relying 0
on 0
supposedly 0
apocryphal 0

from 0
Popes 0

saints 0
bearing 0
on 0
the 0
current 0

But 0
these 0
critics 0
never 0
demonstrate 0
that 0
the 0
oft-cited 0
quotations 0
are 0
apocryphal; 0
they 0
merely 0
assert 0
that 0
they 0
must 0
be, 0
as 0
they 0
seem 0
too 0
probative 0
to 0
be 0
true. 0

This 0
persistence 0
of 0
Mary 0
about 0
the 0
dangers 0
which 0
menace 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
a 0
divine 0
warning 0
against 0
the 0
suicide 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
represented 0
by 0
the 0
alteration 0
of 0
the 0
faith, 0
in 0
her 0
liturgy, 0
her 0
theology 0
and 0
her 0
soul…. 0

I 0

hear 0
all 0
around 0
me 0
innovators 1
who 1
wish 1
to 1
dismantle 1
the 1
Sacred 1
Chapel, 1
destroy 1
the 1
universal 1
flame 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
reject 1
her 1

make 1
her 1
feel 1

historical 1
past. 1

A 0

day 0
will 0
come 0
when 0
the 0
civilized 0
world 0
will 0
deny 0
its 0
God, 0
when 0
the 0
Church 0
will 0
doubt 0
as 0
Peter 0
doubted. 0

She 0
will 0
be 0
tempted 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
man 0
has 0
become 0
God. 0

In 0
our 0

Christians 1
will 1
search 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
red 1
lamp 1
where 1
God 1
awaits 1
them. 1

Like 1
Mary 1
Magdalene, 1
weeping 1
before 1
the 1
empty 1
tomb, 1
they 0
will 0
ask, 0
“Where 0
have 0
they 0
taken 0
Him?” 0

When 0
I 0
first 0
cited 0
this 0
quotation 0
some 0
17 0
years 0

I 0
was 0
contacted 0
by 0
a 0
very 0
prominent 0
neo-Catholic 0
luminary 0
who 0
demanded 0
a 0
source 0
for 0
it, 0
because 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
friends 0
believed 0
it 0
was 0
“apocryphal.” 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
receive 0

Small 0
wonder: 0
Poulet, 0
who 0
died 0
in 0
2014 0
at 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
94, 0
belonged 0
to 0
the 0
“worker-priest” 0
movement 0
that 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Pius 0
XII 0
had 0
condemned, 0
as 0
I 0
note 0
here. 0

His 0
attempt 0
to 0
debunk 0
the 0
quotation 0
involved 0
nit-picking 0
about 0
what 1
he 1
claimed 1
were 1
factual 1
errors 1
elsewhere 1
in 1
the 1
Roche 1
biography. 1

But 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
evidence 1
that 1
the 1
quotation 1
as 1
such 1
was 1
a 1
fabrication. 1

He 1
simply 1
wished 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
so. 1

Let’s 1

give 1
our 1
neo-Catholic 1
friends 1
another 1
“apocryphal” 1
quotation 1
to 1
dismiss 1
out 1
of 1
hand. 1

This 0
one 0
pertains 0
to 0
an 1
astonishing 1
prophecy 1
by 0
Saint 0
Francis 0
of 0
Assisi 0
about 0
a 0
future 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
Peter: 0

A 0

short 0
time 0
before 0
the 0
holy 0
Father’s 0
[St. 0
Francis’] 0
death, 0
he 0
called 0
together 0
his 0
children 0
and 0
warned 0
them 0
of 0
the 0
coming 0
troubles: 0

“Act 1

bravely, 1
my 1
brethren; 1
take 1
courage 1
and 1
trust 1
in 1
the 1
Lord. 1

The 0
time 0
is 0
fast 0
approaching 0
in 0
which 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
great 0
trials 0
and 0
afflictions; 0
perplexities 0
and 0
dissensions, 0
both 0
spiritual 0
and 0
temporal, 0
will 0
abound; 0
the 0
charity 0
of 0
many 0
will 0
grow 0
cold, 0
and 0
the 1
malice 1
of 1
the 1
wicked 1
will 1
increase. 1

The 1
devils 1
will 1
have 1
unusual 1
power; 1
the 1
immaculate 1
purity 1
of 1
our 1
Order, 1
and 1
of 1
others, 1
will 1
be 1
so 1
much 1
obscured 1
that 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
very 1
few 1
Christians 1
who 1
obey 1
the 1
true 1
Supreme 1
Pontiff 1
and 1
the 1
Roman 1
Church 1
with 1
loyal 1
ears 1
and 1
perfect 1
charity. 1

“At 0

the 0
time 0
of 0
this 0
tribulation 0
a 0
man, 0
not 0
canonically 0
elected, 0
will 0
be 0
raised 0
to 0
the 0
Pontificate, 0
who, 0
by 0
his 0
cunning, 0
will 0
endeavour 0
to 0
draw 0
many 0
into 0
error 0
and 0
death. 0

Then 0
scandals 0
will 0
be 0
multiplied, 0
our 0
Order 0
will 0
be 0
divided, 0
and 0
many 0
others 0
will 0
be 0
entirely 0
destroyed, 0
because 0
they 0
will 0
consent 0
to 0
error 0
instead 0
of 0
opposing 0
it. 0

“There 0

of 0
opinions 0

schisms 0
among 0
the 0
people, 0

were 0
shortened, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0

led 0
into 0
error, 0
were 0
they 0
not 0
specially 0
guided, 0
amid 0
such 0
great 0
confusion, 0
by 0
the 0
immense 0
mercy 0
of 0
God…. 0

“Those 1

who 1

their 1
fervor 1
and 1
adhere 1
to 1
virtue 1
with 1

for 0
their 0
persecutors, 0

evil 0
spirits, 0
will 0
say 0
they 0
are 0
rendering 0
a 0

God 0
by 0
destroying 0

“Some 0

It 0
is 0
readily 0
available 0
as 0
a 0
Google 0
book. 0

The 0
same 0
book, 0
it 0
must 0
be 0
noted, 0
contains 0
an 0
appendix 0
setting 0
forth 0
“Doubtful 0
Works 0
of 0
Saint 0
Francis,” 0
of 0
which 0
the 0
quotation 0
is 0
not 0
part. 0

Thus, 0
the 0
publisher 0
itself 0
carefully 0
distinguished 0
the 0
authentic 0
prophecies 0
of 0
Saint 0
Francis 0
from 0
what 0
might 0
be 0
apocryphal. 0

Moreover, 0
in 0
1882 0
there 0
could 0
hardly 0
have 0
been 0
any 0
“radical 0
traditionalist” 0
motive 0
to 0
circulate 0
phony 1
quotations 1
of 1
the 1
saint. 1

"St. 0
Francis 0
in 0
Ecstacy", 0
Caravaggio, 0
1595 0

Saint 0
Francis’ 0
prophecy 0
is 0
clearly 0
not 0
a 0
prediction 0
of 0
the 0
Great 0
Western 0
Schism 0
(1378-1417), 0
which 0
did 0
not 0
involve 0
a 0
“destroyer” 0
on 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
Peter 0
who 0
leads 0
the 0
faithful 0
into 0
error, 0
widespread 0
apostasy, 0
and 0
the 0
persecution 0
of 0
faithful 0
Catholics 0
as 0
“schismatics.” 0
But 0
it 0
does 0
contain 0
elements 0
very 0
familiar 0
to 0
us 0
today. 0

And 1
what 1
inference 1
might 1
one 1
draw 1
from 1
the 1
coincidence 1
that 1
Saint 1
Francis’ 1
prophecy 1
of 1
a 1
future 1
“destroyer” 1
in 1
the 1
papal 1
office 1
seems 1
to 1
correspond 1
rather 1
well 1
with 1
the 1
pontificate 1
of 1
the 1
only 1
Pope 1
who 1
has 1
taken 1
Francis’ 1
name 1
as 1
his 1
own? 1

Something 0

else 0
to 0
consider: 0
Saint 0
Francis, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
greatest 0
saints 0
in 0
Church 0
history, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
few 0
who 0
is 0
known 0
and 0
revered 0
by 0
the 0
whole 0
world, 0
freely 0
revealed 0
his 0
vision 0
of 0
an 0
ecclesial 0
destroyer 0
who 0
usurps 0
the 0
papal 0
office. 0

That 0
is, 0
Saint 0
Francis 0
did 0
not 0
suffer 0
from 0
the 0
currently 0
reigning 0
papolatry, 0
which 0
holds 0
that 0
the 0
indefectibility 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
depends 0
upon 0
defending 0
every 0
word 0
and 0
deed 0
of 0
a 0
given 0
Pope 0
as 0
somehow 0
consistent 0
with 0
Tradition 0
and 0
declares 0
absolutely 0
inadmissible 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
the 0
holder 0
of 0
the 0
Petrine 0
office 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
Faith. 0

Rather, 0
Saint 0
Francis, 0
illuminated 0
by 0
heaven 0
itself, 0
recognized 0
the 0
coming 0
reality 0
of 0
what 0
Saint 0
Robert 0
Bellarmine, 0
a 0
Doctor 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
hypothesized 0
as 0
possible 0
in 0
principle, 0
to 0
cite 0
another 0
“apocryphal” 0
quotation: 0

Just 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
licit 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
Pontiff 0
that 0
aggresses 0
the 0
body, 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
licit 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
one 0
who 0
aggresses 0
souls 0
or 0
who 0
disturbs 0
civil 0
order, 0
or, 0
above 0
all, 0
who 0
attempts 0
to 0
destroy 0
the 0
Church. 0

I 0
say 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
licit 0
to 0
resist 0
by 0
not 0
doing 0
what 0
he 0
orders 0
and 0
by 0
preventing 0
his 0
will 0
from 0
being 0
executed… 0

That 0

for 0

the 0

may­ 0
well 0
issue 0
a 0

of 0

that 0
of 0
the 0
