According 0

Madagascar’s 1

the 0

Although 0
the 0

also 1
an 1

concern 1
amongst 0

who 0
predict 0
it 0
will 0
vastly 0
accelerate 0
the 0
disease’s 0
death 0
toll. 0

Professor 0
John 0
Joe 0
McFadden 0
from 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
Surrey 0
told 0
MailOnline: 0
“Fortunately 0
in 0
[the] 0
plague, 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
developed 0
much 0
antibiotic 0
resistance. 0

If 1
that 1
kicks 1
in, 1
the 1
plague 1
will 1
be 1
far, 1
far 1
scarier. 1

If 0
you 0
throw 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
antibiotics 0
at 0
patients, 0
antibiotic 1
resistance 1
is 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
inevitable.” 1

Dr. 0
Derek 0
Gatherer, 0
from 0
Lancaster 0
University’s 0
biomedical 0
and 0
life-sciences 0
department, 0
told 0
MailOnline 0
the 0
country 0
would 0
struggle 0
“to 0
cope” 0
if 0
cases 0
continue 0
to 0
spiral. 0

“Madagascar, 0
typically 0
like 0
many 0
African 0
countries, 0
doesn’t 0
have 0
many 0
doctors. 0

There 0
are 0
around 0
three-and-a-half 0
thousand 0
doctors 0
for 0
22 0
million 0
people. 0

They 0
only 0
have 0
around 0
6,000 0
hospital 0
beds, 0
so 0
they 0
aren’t 0
particularly 0
well 0
positioned 0
to 0
cope 0
with 0
these 0
kind 0
of 0
events. 0

And 0
if 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
for 0
the 0
international 0
aid 0
coming 0
in 0
things 0
would 0
definitely 0
be 0
much 0
worse 0
for 0
them.” 0

And 0
experts 0
continue 0
to 0
fear 0
the 0
healthcare 0
system 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
brink 0
of 0
being 0
overwhelmed. 0

Should 0
the 0
disease 0
actually 0
spread 0
to 0
the 0
African 0
mainland, 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
all 0
but 0
impossible 0
to 0
control 0
and 0
the 0
health 0
care 0
system 0
would 0
certainly 0
be 0
unable 0
to 0
handle 0
the 0
outbreak 0
at 0
that 0
point, 0
making 1
a 1
global 1
pandemic 1
much 1
more 1
likely. 1
