WASHINGTON 0
– 0
A 0
federal 0
judge 0
on 0
Friday 0
ordered 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
restore 0
CNN 0
reporter 0
Jim 0
Acosta’s 0
press 0
badge, 0
which 0
had 0
been 0
revoked 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
after 0
a 0
contentious 1
exchange 0
at 0
a 0
news 0
conference 0
with 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump. 0

U.S. 0
District 0
Court 0
Judge 0
Timothy 0
Kelly, 0
a 1
Trump 1
appointee, 1
said 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
had 0
violated 0
Acosta’s 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
right 0
to 0
due 0
process 0
by 0
suspending 0
his 0
press 0
badge 0
without 0
explanation 0
or 0
a 0
chance 0
for 0
CNN 0
to 0
appeal 0
the 0
decision. 0

Kelly 0
said 0
White 0
House 0
officials 0
couldn’t 0
say 0
who 0
made 0
the 0
decision 0
or 0
how. 0

The 0
judge 0
ordered 0
the 0
government 0
to 0
restore 0
the 0
credential 0
while 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
– 0
which 0
drew 0
a 0
slew 0
of 0
support 0
from 0
other 0
media 0
outlets, 0
including 0
USA 0
TODAY 0
– 0
is 0
argued. 0

“This 0
court 0
cannot 0
restore 0
Mr. 0
Acosta’s 0
access 0
to 0
press 0
briefings 0
that 0
have 0
already 0
been 0
held,” 0
Kelly 0
said. 0

But 0
Kelly 0
said 0
he 0
hasn’t 0
considered 0
at 0
all 0
yet 0
whether 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
violated 0
Acosta’s 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights. 0

More 0
arguments 0
are 0
expected 0
Tuesday. 0

“I 0
trust 0
this 0
litigation 0
will 0
continue 0
at 0
a 0
rapid 0
pace.” 0
Kelly 0
said. 0

What? 0

Due 0
process? 0

Wait, 0
Acosta 0
was 0
not 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
crime. 0

Neither 0
his 0
property, 0
liberty 0
nor 0
his 0
life 0
was 0
taken. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0

This 0

an 0

not 0

I 0
have 0
made 0
this 0
point 0

and 0
this 0

apparently 0
doesn't 0
get 0
it. 0

I 0

So 0
does 0
Infowars. 0

Will 0
Judge 0
Kelly 0
demand 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
provide 0
us 0
with 0
one 0
as 0
a 0
"right"? 0

Nope, 0
not 0
gonna 0
happen. 0

Because 0
it's 0
not 0
a 0
right. 0

Yet, 0
this 0
judge 0
orders 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
restore 0
the 0
credentials? 0

Give 0
me 0
a 0
break! 0

Acosta's 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
weren't 0
violated 0
either. 0

Furthermore, 0
the 0

did 0

President 0

responded 0
to 0
the 0
order. 0

He 0
told 0
Fox 0
News' 0
Chris 0
Wallace, 0
"Yeah, 0
its 0
fine, 0
I 0
mean 0
it’s 0
not 0
a 0
big 0
deal. 0

What 0
they 0
said, 0
though, 0
is 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
create 0
rules 0
and 0
regulations 0
for 0
conduct 0
etc. 0

etc. 0

We’re 0
doing 0
that, 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
write 0
them 0
up 0
right 0
now. 0

It’s 0
not 0
a 0
big 0
deal 0
and 0
if 0
he 0
misbehaves, 0
we’ll 0
throw 0
him 0
out 0
or 0
we’ll 0
stop 0
the 0
news 0
conference." 0

In 0
speaking 0
about 0
the 0
rules 0
and 0
regulations 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
is 0
writing 0
up, 0
Trump 0
added, 0
"We’re 1
writing 1
them 1
now. 1

We’ll 0
have 0
rules 0
of 0
decorum, 0
you 0
know 0
you 0
can’t 0
keep 0
asking 0
questions. 0

We 0
had 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
reporters 0
in 0
that 0
room, 0
many 1
many 1
reporters 1
in 0
that 0
room 0
and 0
they 0
were 0
unable 0
to 0
ask 0

because 0
this 0
guy 0
gets 0
up 0
and 0
starts, 0
you 0
know, 0
doing 0
what 0
he’s 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
doing 0
for 0
him 0
and 0
for 0
CNN 0
and 0
you 0
know 0
just 0
shouting 0
out 0

statements, 0
too." 0

You 0
know 0
that 0
isn't 0
going 0
to 0
stop 0
someone 0
like 0
Acosta, 0
who 0
claimed 0
to 0
deal 0
in 0
facts 0
and 0
truth, 0
but 0
clearly 0
demonstrated 0
he 0
was 0
all 1
about 1
lies 1
when 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
putting 0
his 0
hands 0
on 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
aide. 0

The 0
order 0
by 0
Judge 0
Kelly 0
is 0
a 0
temporary 0
one 0
that 0
lasts 0
for 0
14 0
days. 0

“I 0
will 0
say 0
this, 0
look, 0
nobody 1
believes 1
in 1
the 1
First 1
Amendment 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
do 1
and 0
if 0
I 0
think 0
somebody 0
is 0
acting 0
out 0
of 0
sorts 0
I 0
will 0
leave," 0

"I 0

thank 0
you 0
very 0
much 0
everybody, 0
I 0
appreciate 0
you 0
coming 0
and 0
I’ll 0
leave. 0

And 0
those 0
reporters 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
too 0
friendly 0
to 0
whoever 0
it 0
is 0
that’s 0
acting 0
up.” 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
following 0
the 0
judge's 0
ruling 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

“Today, 0
the 0
court 0
made 0
clear 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
absolute 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right 0
to 0
access 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
court, 0
we 0
will 0
temporarily 0
reinstate 0
the 0
reporter’s 0
hard 0
pass. 0

We 0
will 0
also 0
further 0
develop 0
rules 0
and 0
processes 0
to 0
ensure 0
fair 0
and 0
orderly 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

There 0
must 0
be 0
decorum 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House.” 0

Well, 0
I 0
can't 0
wait 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
next 0
press 0
conference. 0

Perhaps 0
there 0
is 0
an 0
easier 0
way 0
around 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

Perhaps 0
from 0
now 0
on, 0
President 0
Trump 0
should 0
ignore 0
Jim 0
Acosta 0
and 0
take 0
anyone 1
and 1
everyone 1
else's 0
questions 0
in 0
the 0

his 0
questions. 0
