“This 0 278 8

But 0 278 9
Kelly 0 278 9
said 0 278 9
he 0 278 9
hasn’t 0 278 9
considered 0 278 9

More 0 278 10

What? 0 278 12

Due 0 278 13

Wait, 0 278 14
Acosta 0 278 14
was 0 278 14

charged 0 278 14

This 0 278 31
is 0 278 31
an 0 278 31
issue 0 278 31
of 0 278 31
privilege, 0 278 31

before 0 278 32

this 0 278 32

apparently 0 278 32
doesn't 0 278 32
get 0 278 32
it. 0 278 32

I 0 278 33
want 0 278 33
my 0 278 33
White 0 278 33
House 0 278 33
press 0 278 33
pass! 0 278 33

So 0 278 34
does 0 278 34
Infowars. 0 278 34

Will 0 278 35

us 0 278 35
with 0 278 35
one 0 278 35
as 0 278 35
a 0 278 35
"right"? 0 278 35

Nope, 0 278 36
not 0 278 36
gonna 0 278 36
happen. 0 278 36

Because 0 278 37
it's 0 278 37
not 0 278 37
a 0 278 37
right. 0 278 37

Yet, 0 278 38
this 0 278 38

orders 0 278 38
the 0 278 38
White 0 278 38

Furthermore, 0 278 41
the 0 278 41

White 0 278 53
House 0 278 53

writing 0 278 53
up, 0 278 53
Trump 0 278 53
added, 0 278 53
"We’re 1 278 53
writing 1 278 53
them 1 278 53
now. 1 278 53

We’ll 0 278 54
have 0 278 54
rules 0 278 54
of 0 278 54
decorum, 0 278 54
you 0 278 54
know 0 278 54
you 0 278 54
can’t 0 278 54
keep 0 278 54
asking 0 278 54
questions. 0 278 54

We 0 278 55
had 0 278 55
a 0 278 55
lot 0 278 55
of 0 278 55
reporters 0 278 55
in 0 278 55
that 0 278 55
room, 0 278 55
many 1 278 55
many 1 278 55
reporters 1 278 55
in 0 278 55
that 0 278 55
room 0 278 55
and 0 278 55
they 0 278 55
were 0 278 55
unable 0 278 55
to 0 278 55
ask 0 278 55
questions 0 278 55
because 0 278 55
this 0 278 55
guy 0 278 55
gets 0 278 55
up 0 278 55
and 0 278 55
starts, 0 278 55
you 0 278 55
know, 0 278 55
doing 0 278 55
what 0 278 55
he’s 0 278 55
supposed 0 278 55
to 0 278 55
be 0 278 55
doing 0 278 55
for 0 278 55
him 0 278 55
and 0 278 55
for 0 278 55
CNN 0 278 55
and 0 278 55
you 0 278 55
know 0 278 55
just 0 278 55
shouting 0 278 55
out 0 278 55
questions 0 278 55
and 0 278 55
making 0 278 55
statements, 0 278 55
too." 0 278 55

You 0 278 56
know 0 278 56
that 0 278 56
isn't 0 278 56
going 0 278 56
to 0 278 56
stop 0 278 56
someone 0 278 56
like 0 278 56
Acosta, 0 278 56
who 0 278 56
claimed 0 278 56
to 0 278 56
deal 0 278 56
in 0 278 56
facts 0 278 56
and 0 278 56
truth, 0 278 56
but 0 278 56
clearly 0 278 56
demonstrated 0 278 56
he 0 278 56
was 0 278 56
all 1 278 56
about 1 278 56
lies 1 278 56
when 0 278 56
it 0 278 56
came 0 278 56
to 0 278 56
putting 0 278 56
his 0 278 56
hands 0 278 56
on 0 278 56
a 0 278 56
White 0 278 56
House 0 278 56
aide. 0 278 56

The 0 278 57
order 0 278 57
by 0 278 57
Judge 0 278 57
Kelly 0 278 57
is 0 278 57
a 0 278 57
temporary 0 278 57
one 0 278 57
that 0 278 57
lasts 0 278 57
for 0 278 57
14 0 278 57
days. 0 278 57

“I 0 278 58
will 0 278 58
say 0 278 58
this, 0 278 58
look, 0 278 58
nobody 1 278 58
believes 1 278 58
in 1 278 58
the 1 278 58
First 1 278 58
Amendment 1 278 58
more 1 278 58
than 1 278 58
I 1 278 58
do 1 278 58
and 0 278 58
if 0 278 58
I 0 278 58
think 0 278 58
somebody 0 278 58
is 0 278 58
acting 0 278 58
out 0 278 58
of 0 278 58
sorts 0 278 58
I 0 278 58
will 0 278 58
leave," 0 278 58
Trump 0 278 58
continued. 0 278 58

"I 0 278 59
will 0 278 59
say 0 278 59
thank 0 278 59
you 0 278 59
very 0 278 59
much 0 278 59
everybody, 0 278 59
I 0 278 59
appreciate 0 278 59
you 0 278 59
coming 0 278 59
and 0 278 59
I’ll 0 278 59
leave. 0 278 59

And 0 278 60
those 0 278 60
reporters 0 278 60
will 0 278 60
not 0 278 60
be 0 278 60
too 0 278 60
friendly 0 278 60
to 0 278 60
whoever 0 278 60
it 0 278 60
is 0 278 60
that’s 0 278 60
acting 0 278 60
up.” 0 278 60

White 0 278 61
House 0 278 61
Press 0 278 61
Secretary 0 278 61
Sarah 0 278 61
Sanders 0 278 61
issued 0 278 61
a 0 278 61
statement 0 278 61
following 0 278 61
the 0 278 61
judge's 0 278 61
ruling 0 278 61
on 0 278 61
Thursday. 0 278 61

“Today, 0 278 62
the 0 278 62
court 0 278 62
made 0 278 62
clear 0 278 62
that 0 278 62
there 0 278 62
is 0 278 62
no 0 278 62
absolute 0 278 62
First 0 278 62
Amendment 0 278 62
right 0 278 62
to 0 278 62
access 0 278 62
the 0 278 62
White 0 278 62
House. 0 278 62

In 0 278 63
response 0 278 63
to 0 278 63
the 0 278 63
court, 0 278 63
we 0 278 63
will 0 278 63
temporarily 0 278 63
reinstate 0 278 63
the 0 278 63
reporter’s 0 278 63
hard 0 278 63
pass. 0 278 63

We 0 278 64
will 0 278 64
also 0 278 64
further 0 278 64
develop 0 278 64
rules 0 278 64
and 0 278 64
processes 0 278 64
to 0 278 64
ensure 0 278 64
fair 0 278 64
and 0 278 64
orderly 0 278 64
press 0 278 64
conferences 0 278 64
in 0 278 64
the 0 278 64
future. 0 278 64

There 0 278 65
must 0 278 65
be 0 278 65
decorum 0 278 65
at 0 278 65
the 0 278 65
White 0 278 65
House.” 0 278 65

Well, 0 278 66
I 0 278 66
can't 0 278 66
wait 0 278 66
to 0 278 66
see 0 278 66
the 0 278 66
next 0 278 66
press 0 278 66
conference. 0 278 66

Perhaps 0 278 67
there 0 278 67
is 0 278 67
an 0 278 67
easier 0 278 67
way 0 278 67
around 0 278 67
all 0 278 67
of 0 278 67
this. 0 278 67

Perhaps 0 278 68
from 0 278 68
now 0 278 68
on, 0 278 68
President 0 278 68
Trump 0 278 68
should 0 278 68
ignore 0 278 68
Jim 0 278 68
Acosta 0 278 68
and 0 278 68
take 0 278 68
anyone 1 278 68
and 1 278 68
everyone 1 278 68
else's 0 278 68
questions 0 278 68
in 0 278 68
the 0 278 68
room 0 278 68
but 0 278 68
his 0 278 68
questions. 0 278 68

See 0 278 69
how 0 278 69
he 0 278 69
likes 0 278 69
them 0 278 69
apples. 0 278 69
