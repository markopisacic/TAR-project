Wednesday 0 269 18

The 0 269 20

at 0 269 20
Haig's 0 269 20
home 0 269 20
in 0 269 20
Mesa, 0 269 20
because 0 269 20
he 0 269 20
didn't 0 269 20

all 0 269 20
the 0 269 20

at 0 269 20
the 0 269 20
gun 0 269 20
show. 0 269 20

Victor 0 269 21
said 0 269 21
a 0 269 21
box 0 269 21
that 0 269 21
Paddock 0 269 21
used 0 269 21

ammunition 0 269 21
out 0 269 21
of 0 269 21

the 0 269 21

launched. 0 269 21

It's 0 269 22
unknown 0 269 22
whether 0 269 22
the 0 269 22
ammunition 0 269 22
Haig 0 269 22
sold 0 269 22
to 0 269 22
Paddock 0 269 22
was 0 269 22
used 0 269 22
in 0 269 22
the 0 269 22
attack. 0 269 22

The 0 269 23
lawyer 0 269 23

the 0 269 23
type 0 269 23
and 0 269 23
quantity 0 269 23
of 0 269 23

Paddock 0 269 23
bought 0 269 23
from 0 269 23
his 0 269 23
client 0 269 23
wasn't 0 269 23
unusual. 0 269 23
