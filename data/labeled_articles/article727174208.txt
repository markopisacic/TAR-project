at 0 129 20
Haig's 0 129 20
home 0 129 20
in 0 129 20
Mesa, 0 129 20

the 0 129 20

said 0 129 21
a 0 129 21
box 0 129 21
that 0 129 21
Paddock 0 129 21
used 0 129 21

It's 0 129 22
unknown 0 129 22

the 0 129 22
ammunition 0 129 22
Haig 0 129 22
sold 0 129 22
to 0 129 22
Paddock 0 129 22

in 0 129 22
the 0 129 22
attack. 0 129 22

The 0 129 23

quantity 0 129 23
of 0 129 23

Paddock 0 129 23
bought 0 129 23
from 0 129 23
his 0 129 23
client 0 129 23
wasn't 0 129 23
