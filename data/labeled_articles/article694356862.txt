Obama's 0 17 5
disastrous 1 17 5
nuclear 0 17 5
deal 0 17 5

Iran's 1 17 5
path 1 17 5
to 1 17 5
eventually 1 17 5
becoming 1 17 5
a 1 17 5
nuclear-armed 1 17 5
state, 1 17 5
while 0 17 5
immediately 0 17 5

of 0 17 5
dollars 0 17 5
to 0 17 5
fund 0 17 5
its 0 17 5
aggression. 0 17 5

Meanwhile, 0 17 6
Syria 0 17 6
has 0 17 6
become 0 17 6
ground 0 17 6
zero 0 17 6
for 0 17 6
Iran's 0 17 6
execution 0 17 6
of 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
regional 0 17 6
ambitions, 0 17 6
which 0 17 6
is 0 17 6
to 0 17 6
establish 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
Shiite 0 17 6
Crescent 0 17 6
connecting 0 17 6
with 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
allies, 0 17 6
including 0 17 6
Iraq, 0 17 6
Syria 0 17 6
and 0 17 6
Lebanon. 0 17 6

This 0 17 7
plan 0 17 7
has 0 17 7
included 0 17 7
the 0 17 7
establishment 0 17 7
of 0 17 7
a 0 17 7
land 0 17 7
route 0 17 7
that 0 17 7
Iranian-backed 0 17 7
militias 0 17 7
secured 0 17 7
in 0 17 7
June, 0 17 7
beginning 0 17 7
on 0 17 7
Iran’s 0 17 7
border 0 17 7
with 0 17 7
Iraq 0 17 7
and 0 17 7
running 0 17 7
across 0 17 7
Iraq 0 17 7
and 0 17 7
Syria 0 17 7
all 0 17 7
the 0 17 7
way 0 17 7
to 0 17 7
Syria’s 0 17 7
Mediterranean 0 17 7
coast. 0 17 7

This 0 17 8
road 0 17 8
makes 0 17 8
Iran’s 0 17 8
job 0 17 8
easier 0 17 8
in 0 17 8
supplying 0 17 8
arms 0 17 8
by 0 17 8
land, 0 17 8
as 0 17 8
well 0 17 8
as 0 17 8
by 0 17 8
air 0 17 8
and 0 17 8
sea, 0 17 8
to 0 17 8
prop 0 17 8
up 0 17 8
Syrian 0 17 8
President 0 17 8
Bashar 0 17 8
al-Assad’s 0 17 8
regime 0 17 8
and 0 17 8
to 0 17 8
equip 0 17 8
Iran’s 0 17 8
own 0 17 8
forces 0 17 8
fighting 0 17 8
inside 0 17 8
of 0 17 8
Syria 0 17 8
in 0 17 8
support 0 17 8
of 0 17 8
Assad. 0 17 8

This 0 17 9
helps 0 17 9
explain 0 17 9
why 0 17 9
Iran 0 17 9
has 0 17 9
placed 0 17 9
so 0 17 9
much 0 17 9
importance 0 17 9
on 0 17 9
helping 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Syrian 0 17 9
regime 0 17 9
establish 0 17 9
control 0 17 9
over 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Deir 0 17 9

area 0 17 9
in 0 17 9
eastern 0 17 9

“Everything 0 17 10
depends 0 17 10
now 0 17 10
on 0 17 10
the 0 17 10
Americans’ 0 17 10
willingness 0 17 10
to 0 17 10
stop 0 17 10
this,” 0 17 10
said 0 17 10
an 0 17 10
Iraqi 0 17 10
Kurdish 0 17 10
official 0 17 10
who 0 17 10
was 0 17 10

in 0 17 10
a 0 17 10

However, 0 17 11
U.S.-led 0 17 11
coalition 0 17 11
forces 0 17 11
apparently 0 17 11
have 0 17 11
done 0 17 11
next 0 17 11
to 0 17 11
nothing 0 17 11
to 0 17 11
stop 0 17 11
this 0 17 11
major 0 17 11
advance 0 17 11
in 0 17 11
Iran’s 0 17 11

expansion. 0 17 11

“Obama 0 17 12
ran 0 17 12
down 0 17 12
our 0 17 12
options 0 17 12
in 0 17 12
Syria 0 17 12
so 0 17 12
thoroughly, 0 17 12
by 0 17 12
the 0 17 12
time 0 17 12
this 0 17 12
administration 0 17 12
took 0 17 12
over,” 0 17 12
said 0 17 12
Andrew 0 17 12
Tabler, 0 17 12
senior 0 17 12
fellow 0 17 12
at 0 17 12
the 0 17 12
Washington 0 17 12
Institute 0 17 12
for 0 17 12
Near 0 17 12

Policy. 0 17 12

“The 0 17 13
Iranian 0 17 13
influence 0 17 13
is 0 17 13
spreading 0 17 13
because 0 17 13
they 0 17 13
are 0 17 13
so 0 17 13
heavily 0 17 13
involved 0 17 13
in 0 17 13
regime 0 17 13
activities,” 0 17 13
Tabler 0 17 13
added. 0 17 13

“It’s 1 17 14
a 1 17 14
new 1 17 14
monster.” 1 17 14

Furthermore, 0 17 15
Iran 0 17 15
has 0 17 15
funded 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
armed 0 17 15
its 0 17 15
terrorist 0 17 15
proxy 0 17 15
Hezbollah, 0 17 15
which 0 17 15
has 0 17 15
sent 0 17 15
its 0 17 15
militia 0 17 15
from 0 17 15
its 0 17 15
home 0 17 15
base 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
Lebanon 0 17 15
to 0 17 15
fight 0 17 15
alongside 0 17 15
Assad's 0 17 15
forces. 0 17 15

And 0 17 16
Iran 0 17 16
has 0 17 16
used 0 17 16
Syria 0 17 16
as 0 17 16
a 0 17 16
transit 0 17 16
point 0 17 16
for 0 17 16
shipment 0 17 16
of 0 17 16
sophisticated 0 17 16
rockets 0 17 16
to 0 17 16
Hezbollah 0 17 16

use 0 17 16
against 0 17 16
Israeli 0 17 16
population 0 17 16
centers. 0 17 16

Despite 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
fact 0 17 17
that 0 17 17
Hezbollah 0 17 17
has 0 17 17
American 1 17 17
blood 1 17 17
on 0 17 17
its 0 17 17
hands, 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
U.S.-led 0 17 17
coalition 0 17 17
has 0 17 17
chosen 0 17 17
not 0 17 17
to 0 17 17
do 0 17 17
anything 0 17 17
about 0 17 17
Hezbollah’s 0 17 17
presence 0 17 17
in 0 17 17
Syria, 0 17 17
bought 0 17 17
and 0 17 17
paid 0 17 17
for 0 17 17
by 0 17 17
Iran. 0 17 17

While 0 17 18
Israel 0 17 18
chose 0 17 18
not 0 17 18
to 0 17 18
take 0 17 18
sides 0 17 18
in 0 17 18
Syria's 0 17 18
civil 0 17 18
war 0 17 18
with 0 17 18

of 0 17 18
its 0 17 18

it 0 17 18
has 0 17 18
bombed 0 17 18
weapons 0 17 18

facilities 0 17 18
and 0 17 18
convoys 0 17 18

Syria 0 17 18
for 0 17 18
its 0 17 18
own 0 17 18
protection. 0 17 18

Just 0 17 19
recently, 0 17 19
on 0 17 19
September 0 17 19
7th, 0 17 19
Israeli 0 17 19
jets 0 17 19
struck 0 17 19
a 0 17 19
Syrian 0 17 19

facility 0 17 19
near 0 17 19

was 0 17 19
reported 0 17 19
to 0 17 19

the 0 17 19
production 0 17 19
of 0 17 19
chemical 0 17 19

and 0 17 19
the 0 17 19
storage 0 17 19
of 0 17 19
missiles. 0 17 19

Israel 0 17 20
will 0 17 20
also 0 17 20
do 0 17 20
what 0 17 20
is 0 17 20
necessary 0 17 20
to 0 17 20
repel 0 17 20
Iranian-backed 0 17 20
forces 0 17 20
if 0 17 20
they 0 17 20
edge 0 17 20
too 0 17 20
close 0 17 20
to 0 17 20
areas 0 17 20
near 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
Golan 0 17 20
Heights, 0 17 20
shrinking 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
buffer 0 17 20
between 0 17 20
Israel 0 17 20
and 0 17 20
Iranian 0 17 20
controlled 0 17 20
territories. 0 17 20

However, 0 17 21
such 0 17 21
tactical 0 17 21
measures 0 17 21
may 0 17 21
not 0 17 21
be 0 17 21
enough 0 17 21
to 0 17 21
thwart 0 17 21
Iran’s 0 17 21
larger 0 17 21
ambitions. 0 17 21

In 0 17 22
light 0 17 22
of 0 17 22
intelligence 0 17 22
reports 0 17 22
that 0 17 22
Assad 0 17 22
may 0 17 22
be 0 17 22
ready 0 17 22
to 0 17 22
invite 0 17 22
Iran 0 17 22

set 0 17 22
up 0 17 22
military 0 17 22
bases 0 17 22
in 0 17 22
Syria, 0 17 22
Israeli 0 17 22
leaders 0 17 22
have 0 17 22
concluded 0 17 22
that 0 17 22
they 0 17 22
cannot 0 17 22
wait 0 17 22
until 0 17 22
the 0 17 22

with 0 17 22

its 0 17 22

strategy. 0 17 22

“Their 0 17 23
overriding 0 17 23
