O’Malley, 0
the 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Boston, 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
statement 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
had 0
“given 0
much 0
prayerful 1
consideration” 1
to 0
the 0
membership 0
of 0
the 0
panel. 0

“The 0
newly 0
appointed 0
members 0
will 0
add 0
to 0
the 0
Commission’s 0
global 0
perspective 0
in 0
the 0
protection 0
of 0
minors 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
adults,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“The 0
Holy 0
Father 0
has 0
ensured 0
continuity 0
in 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
our 0
Commission, 0
which 0
is 0
to 0
assist 0
local 0
churches 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
in 0
their 0
efforts 0
to 0
safeguard 0
all 0
children, 0
young 0
people, 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
adults 0
from 0
harm.” 0

Local 0
survivors 0
of 0
abuse 0
greeted 0
the 0
announcement 0
warily, 0
hopeful 0
that 0
there 0
could 0
be 0
positive 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
but 0
saying 0
the 0
panel 0
accomplished 0
little 0
under 0
its 0
first 0
three-year 0
mandate. 0

“The 0
objectives 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
when 0
it 0
was 0
first 0
announced, 0
when 0
it 0
was 0
just 0
getting 0
started. 0

. 0

. 0

were 0
never 0
fulfilled,” 0
said 0
Phil 0
Saviano, 0
an 0
abuse 0
survivor 0
who 0
founded 0
the 0
New 0
England 0
chapter 0
of 0
the 0
Survivors 0
Network 0
of 0
those 0
Abused 0
by 0
Priests. 0

Saviano 0
said 0
the 0
commission 0
is 0
“a 0
good 0
idea,” 0
and 0
added, 0
“I’m 0
not 0
particularly 0
optimistic 0
that 0
much 0
will 0
get 0
accomplished, 0
but 0
a 0
commission 0
is 0
better 0
than 0
no 0
commission.” 0

Given 0
his 0
long 0
experience 0
witnessing 0
the 1
church’s 1
inertia 1
on 1
the 1
issue, 1
Saviano 0
said, 0
he 1
has 1
set 1
his 1
expectations 1
at 1
rock 1
bottom. 1

“That’s 0
kind 0
of 0
my 0
attitude 0
now: 0
If 1
I 1
don’t 1
expect 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
to 1
do 1
anything, 1
then 1
I 1
won’t 1
be 1
too 1
disappointed 1
when 1
they 1
don’t 1
do 1
anything,” 1
he 0
continued. 0

Jim 0
Scanlan, 0
another 0
survivor, 0
said 0
“the 0
timing 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
too 0
perfect” 0
given 0
the 0
controversy 0
last 0
month 0
surrounding 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
remarks 0
that 0
accused 0
victims 0
of 0
a 0
notorious 1
Chilean 1
pedophile 1
priest, 1
the 0
Rev. 0

Fernando 0
Karadima, 0
of 0
“slander” 1
against 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros, 0
who 0
the 0
victims 0
say 0
was 0
complicit 0
in 0
a 0
cover 0
up. 0

The 0
pope 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
seen 0
no 0
proof 0
of 0
Barros’s 0
guilt, 0
but 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
reported 0
that 0
O’Malley 0
and 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
had 0
in 0
2015 0
hand-delivered 0
to 0
him 0
an 0
eight-page 0
letter 0
from 0
a 0
survivor 0
that 0
graphically 0
detailed 0
his 0
abuse 0
and 0
said 0
Barros 0
and 0
other 0
clergy 0
had 0
witnessed 0
him 0
being 0
fondled 0
but 0
had 0
not 0
intervened. 0

Scanlan 0
said 0
his 0
reaction 0
to 0
hearing 0
that 0
Francis 0
has 0
revived 0
the 0
commission 0
was 0
“hopeful 0
but 0
cynical.” 0
Like 0
Saviano, 0
he 0
said 0
the 0
panel 0
accomplished 0
little 0
in 0
its 0
first 0
incarnation. 0

“My 0
expectation 0
is 0
it 0
will 0
probably 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
outcome, 0
because 0
the 0
church 0
is 0
the 0
church, 0
and 0
they 0
do 0
it 0
for 0
appearance, 0
but 0
they’re 0
still 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
by 0
their 0
own 0
rules,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“I’ve 1
seen 1
little 1
that 1
has 1
changed.” 1

Scanlan 0
said 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
given 0
him 0
hope 0
for 0
progress 0
on 0
some 0
issues 0
in 0
the 0
church, 0
but 0
on 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
he 0
“continues 1
to 1
be 1
blind 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
church 1
has 1
done.” 1

Last 0
month, 0
O’Malley 0
denounced 0
the 0
pope’s 0
controversial 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishop. 0

Despite 0
distancing 0
himself 0
from 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
comments, 0
O’Malley 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
witnessed 0
the 0
pontiff’s 0
genuine 0
compassion 0
for 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

“The 0
Pope’s 0
statements 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
place 0
in 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
would 0
abuse 0
children 0
and 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
adhere 0
to 0
zero 0
tolerance 0
for 0
these 0
crimes 0
are 0
genuine,” 0
O’Malley 0
said, 0
“and 0
they 0
are 0
his 0
commitment.” 0
