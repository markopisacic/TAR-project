For 0
any 0
constitutionalist, 0
the 0
ruling 0
by 0
Trump-appointed 1
Judge 0
Timothy 0
J. 0
Kelly 0
was 0
nothing 1
but 1
surreal, 1
and 0
honestly, 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
impeached 0
over 0
his 0
frivolous 1
ruling 0
that 0
demanded 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
reinstate 0
CNN 0
reporter 0
Jim 0
Acosta's 0
press 0
pass. 0

However, 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
decided 0
to 0
comply, 0
which 0
I 0
wonder 0
just 0
how 0
dangerous 1
a 0
precedent 0
this 0
sets, 0
and 0
as 0
a 0
result, 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
has 0
issued 0
a 0
code 0
of 0
conduct 0

White 0

press. 0

We 0
have 0
created 0
these 0
rules 0
with 0
a 0
degree 0
of 0
regret,” 0
Sanders 0
said 0
in 0

statement. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
submitted 0
to 0
such 0
a 0
ridiculous 1
demand 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
simple 0
human 0
decency 0

both 0
Sarah 0
Sanders, 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
and 0
a 0

“We 0
would 0
have 0
greatly 0
preferred 0
to 0
continue 0
hosting 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
understood 0
professional 0
norms, 0
and 0
we 0
believe 0
the 0
overwhelming 0
majority 0
of 0
journalists 0
covering 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
share 0
that 0
preference,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“But, 0
given 0
the 0
position 0
taken 0
by 0
CNN, 0
we 0
now 0
feel 0
obligated 0
to 0
replace 0
previously 0
shared 0
practices 0
with 0
explicit 0
rules.” 0

Oh, 0
but 0
there's 0
more. 0

If 0
journalists 0
can't 0
conduct 0
themselves 0
according 0
to 0
these 0
rules, 0
then 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
option 0
but 0
to.... 0
write 0
more 0
explicit 0
rules! 0

Seriously! 1

“At 0
this 0
time, 0
however, 0
we 0
have 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
frame 0
such 0
rules 0
in 0
the 0
hope 0
that 0
professional 0
journalistic 0
norms 0
will 0
suffice 0
to 0
regulate 0
conduct 0
in 0
those 0
places,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“If 0
unprofessional 0
behavior 0
occurs 0
in 0
those 0
settings, 0
or 0
if 0
a 0
court 0
should 0
decide 0
that 0
explicit 0
rules 0
are 0
required 0
to 0
regulate 0
conduct 0
there, 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
forced 0
to 0
reconsider 0
this 0
decision.” 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
should 0
be 0
telling 0
Judge 0
Kelly 0
where 0
he 0
can 0
take 0
his 0
ruling, 0
but 0
they 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
look 0
like 0
they 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
high 0
ground 0
while 0
submitting 0
to 0
unconstitutional 0
rulings 0
from 0
a 0
federal 0
judge 0
who 0
should 0
know 0
better. 0

However, 0
here 0
are 0
the 0
new 0
rules 0
released 0
by 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Office. 0

(1) 0
A 0
journalist 0
called 0
upon 0
to 0
ask 0
a 0
question 0
will 0
ask 0
a 0
single 0
question 0
and 0
then 0
will 0
yield 0
the 0
floor 0
to 0
other 0
journalists; 0
(2) 0
At 0
the 0
discretion 0
of 0
the 0
President 0
or 0
other 0
White 0
House 0
official 0
taking 0
questions, 0
a 0
follow-up 0
question 0
or 0
questions 0
may 0
be 0
permitted; 0
and 0
where 0
a 0
follow 0
up 0
has 0
been 0
allowed 0
and 0
asked, 0
the 0
questioner 0
will 0
then 0
yield 0
the 0
floor; 0
(3) 0
“Yielding 0
the 0
floor” 0
includes, 0
when 0
applicable, 0
physically 0
surrendering 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
White 0
House 0
staff 0
for 0
use 0
by 0
the 0
next 0
questioner; 0
(4) 0
Failure 0
to 0
abide 0
by 0
any 0
of 0
rules 0
(1)-(3) 0
may 0
result 0
in 0
suspension 0
or 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
hard 0
pass. 0

I 1
can 1
see 1
this 1
going 1
way 1
downhill. 1

If 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
people 0
like 0
Acosta, 0
at 0
the 0
moment 0
they 0
begin 0
to 0
show 0
who 0
and 0
what 0
they 0
really 0
are, 0
stop 0
calling 0
on 0
them 0
for 0
questions. 0

This 0
is 0
my 0
advice 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Don't 0
call 0
on 0
Jim 0
Acosta 0
another 0
time 0
for 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
he 0
remains 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Press. 0

Make 0
him 0
regret 0
it 0
the 0
entire 0
time 0
he 0
is 0
there. 0
