in 0

the 0

said 0
it 0
is 0
looking 0
into 0
what 0
happened. 0

“All 0
allegations 0
of 0
domestic 0
abuse 0
are 0
disturbing 0
and 0
should 0
be 0
taken 0
seriously. 0

We 0
are 0
working 0
with 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
state 0
party 0
to 0
review 0
these 0
allegations,” 0
a 0
DNC 0
spokeswoman 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
Wednesday 0
morning, 0
declining 0
to 0
comment 0
further. 0

The 0
Democratic 0
Party’s 0
choice 0
of 0
Ellingstad 0
to 0
conduct 0
the 0
investigation 0
was 0
met 0
with 0
derision 0
from 0
many 0
who 0
said 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
independent, 0
including 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
Jr., 0
who 0
mocked 0
the 0
investigation 0
in 0
a 0
Tweet 0
Wednesday. 0

The 0

Lockridge 0

both 0
Republican 0

candidates, 0
including 0
Ellison, 0
according 0
to 0

the 0

by 0
a 0
margin 0

about 0
four 0
to 0
one. 0

As 0
we 0
previously 0
reported: 0

Rep. 0
Keith 0
Ellison, 0
who 0
is 0
currently 0
running 0
for 0
attorney 0
general 0
of 0
Minnesota, 0
is 0
being 0
accused 0
of 0
domestic 0
violence 0
against 0
his 0
former 0
partner 0
Karen 0
Monahan. 0

Austin 0
Monahan, 0
Karen 0
Monahan’s 0
son, 0
aired 0
the 0
allegations 0
in 0
a 0
Facebook 0
post 0
Saturday 0
night. 0

According 0
to 0
Austin 0
Monahan, 0
Ellison 0
put 0
his 0
mother 0
through 0
“pure 1
hell.” 1
In 0
the 0
Facebook 0
post, 0
he 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
video 0
of 0
Ellison 0
dragging 0
Karen 0
Monahan 0
off 0
the 0
bed 0
by 0
her 0
feet 0
while 0
screaming 0
expletives 0
at 0
her. 0

The 0
alleged 0
incident 0
is 0
just 0
one 0
of 0
several, 0
Austin 0
Monahan 0
warned. 0

State 0
Rep. 0
Debra 0
Hilstrom 0
(D-Brooklyn 0
Center) 0
was 0
quick 0
to 0
voice 0
her 0
concern 0
over 0
the 0
accusations, 0
calling 0
on 0
Ellison 0
to 0
“answer 0
these 0
allegations.” 0
DFL-endorsed 0
candidate 0
for 0
attorney 0
general 0
of 0
Minnesota 0
Matt 0
Pelikan 0
also 0
reacted 0
to 0
the 0
story, 0
calling 0
the 0
allegations 0
“extremely 1
troubling.” 1
Karen 0
Monahan 0
has 0
also 0
hinted 0
at 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
telling 0
Ellison 0
that 0
her 0
“kids, 0
job, 0
health, 0
finances, 0
humanity 0
was 0
deeply 0
impacted 0
by 0
the 0
abuse 0
you 0
are 0
well 0
aware 0
of.” 0
Karen 0
Monahan 0
claims 0
she 0
has 0
videos, 0
recordings, 0
and 0
messages 0
to 0
prove 0
her 0
story. 0

Ellison 0
has 0
admitted 0
the 0
relationship, 0
but 0
is 0
denying 0
the 0
abuse. 0

And 0
the 0
relationship 0
was 0
clearly 0
real. 0

Karen 0
Monahan, 0
an 0
organizer 0
with 0
the 0
Sierra 0
Club, 0
was 0
in 0
a 0
relationship 0
with 0
Ellison 0
for 0
years. 0

The 0
two 0
are 0
seen 0
together 0
in 0
many 0
of 0
her 0
social 0
media 0
posts, 0
including 0
hiking 0
in 0
together 0
national 0
parks 0
and 0
posing 0
with 0
the 0
Obamas 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Records 0
show 0
she 0
lived 0
in 0
his 0
Minneapolis 0
home 0
before 0
their 0
relationship 0
ended. 0

Ellison, 0
who 0
was 0
previously 0
married 0
to 0
a 0
different 0
woman, 0
is 0
divorced. 0

It's 0
hard 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
really 0
happened 0
in 0
a 0
relationship. 0

And 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
kept 0
it 0
quiet. 0

"Keith 0
Ellison 0
flatly 0
denies 0
allegation 0
that 0
he 0
abused 0
an 0
ex 0
girlfriend. 0

The 0
story 0
had 0
been 0
circulating 0
in 0
MN, 0
and 0
not 0
held 0
up 0
under 0
media 0
scrutiny, 0
so 0
no 0
stories 0
ran. 0

It 0
blew 0
up 0
last 0
night 0
after 0
the 0
ex’s 0
son 0
posted 0
the 0
allegation 0
on 0
Facebook." 0

Dave 0
Weigel. 0

It's 0
not 0
quite 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
for 0
Keith 0
X. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
Ellison 0
has 0
faced 0
misconduct 0
allegations. 0

In 0
2006, 0
a 0
woman 0
named 0
Amy 0
Alexandar 0
claimed 0
that 0
Ellison 0
ostracized 0
her 0
and 0
smeared 0
her 0
name 0
after 0
having 0
an 0
extramarital 0
affair 0
with 0
her 0
in 0
the 0
1990s 0
and 0
then 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
2000s. 0

Ellison 0
in 0
2005 0
filed 0
a 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
her 0
after 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
phone 0
and 0
email 0
harassment. 0

She 0
subsequently 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
him, 0
which 0
a 0
judge 0
denied, 0
ordering 0
her 0
to 0
stop 0
repeating 0
allegations 0
of 0
an 0
affair 0
or 0
intimidation. 0

Ellison 0
subsequently 0
agreed 0
to 0
dismiss 0
his 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
her 0
if 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
contacted 0
him. 0

I'm 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
damage 0
control 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
elections. 0

Ellison 0
won 0
the 0
primary 0
days 0
after 0
the 0
allegations 0
were 0
made 0
public. 0

Of 0
course, 0
accusations 0
does 0
not 0
make 0
one 0
guilty 0
for 0
Ellison 0
anymore 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
for 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

However, 0
at 0
least 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Ellison, 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
women 0
were 0
not 0
scared 0
about 0
their 0
reputation 0
and 0
had 0
any 0
political 0
motive 0
to 0
call 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
file 0
a 0
report. 0

When 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Ellison 0
though, 0
we 0
know 0
he 0
is 0
an 0
effeminate 1
pansy 1
who 0
simply 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
answer 0
to 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
and 0
even 0
seeks 0
security 0
to 0
hide 0
from 0
a 0
female 0
report 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
a 0
camera. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
faced 0
it 0
all 0
and 0
fought 0
back 0
against 0
it. 0
