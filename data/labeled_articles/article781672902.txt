that 0 93 3
the 0 93 3
extreme 0 93 3

which 0 93 3
the 1 93 3

Munich 0 93 3

The 0 93 6

to 0 93 6

Ukraine, 0 93 6
a 0 93 6
Russian 0 93 6
province 0 93 6
for 0 93 6
more 0 93 6
than 0 93 6
three 0 93 6
centuries, 0 93 6
to 0 93 6
create 0 93 6
problems 0 93 6
for 0 93 6
Russia 0 93 6
that 0 93 6
would 0 93 6

emphasized, 1 93 9
the 1 93 9

Donald 0 93 10
Trump 0 93 10
is 1 93 10
totally 1 93 10
correct 1 93 10
that 0 93 10
nuclear 0 93 10
war 0 93 10
would 0 93 10
be 0 93 10
a 0 93 10
terminable 0 93 10
event 0 93 10
and 0 93 10
that 0 93 10
nothing 1 93 10
is 1 93 10
more 1 93 10
important 1 93 10
than 0 93 10
restoring 0 93 10
a 0 93 10

The 0 93 11
problem 0 93 11
is 0 93 11
that 0 93 11
the 0 93 11
military/security 0 93 11
complex 0 93 11
sees 0 93 11
it 0 93 11
differently. 0 93 11

After 0 93 12
70 0 93 12
years 0 93 12
of 0 93 12
entrenchment 0 93 12
the 0 93 12
military/security 0 93 12
complex 0 93 12
is 0 93 12
an 0 93 12
independent 0 93 12
political 0 93 12
force. 0 93 12

President 0 93 13

the 0 93 13
American 0 93 13
people 0 93 13
about 0 93 13
this 0 93 13

the 0 93 14
standpoint 0 93 14
of 0 93 14
the 0 93 14

the 0 93 14

of 0 93 14
normalizing 0 93 14
relations 0 93 14
with 0 93 14
Russia 0 93 14
is 0 93 14
that 0 93 14
it 0 93 14
downgrades 0 93 14
the 0 93 14
“Russian 0 93 14
threat” 0 93 14
that 0 93 14
is 0 93 14
so 0 93 14
essential 0 93 14
to 0 93 14
the 0 93 14

budget 0 93 14
of 0 93 14

complex 0 93 14
and 0 93 14

that 0 93 14
such 0 93 14
a 0 93 14

The 0 93 16

that 0 93 19

a 0 93 19

After 0 93 20
two 0 93 20
years 0 93 20
the 0 93 20
only 0 93 20
evidence 0 93 20
we 0 93 20
have 0 93 20
of 0 93 20
Russiagate 0 93 20
is 0 93 20
that 0 93 20
it 1 93 20
is 1 93 20
a 1 93 20
conspiracy 1 93 20
against 1 93 20

Trump 1 93 20
and 1 93 20
the 1 93 20

Indeed, 0 93 21
Mueller, 0 93 21
fully 0 93 21
aware 0 93 21
that 0 93 21
there 0 93 21
was 0 93 21
no 0 93 21

was 0 93 26
found 0 93 26
guilty 0 93 26
not 0 93 26
of 0 93 26
Russiagate, 0 93 26

of 0 93 26

settled 0 93 28
with 0 93 28
a 0 93 28
plea 0 93 28
bargain. 0 93 28

Even 0 93 29
the 0 93 29
innocent 0 93 29
had 0 93 29
rather 0 93 29
work 0 93 29
out 0 93 29
a 0 93 29
plea 0 93 29
arrangement 0 93 29
and 0 93 29
admit 0 93 29
to 0 93 29
something 0 93 29
that 0 93 29
they 0 93 29
did 0 93 29
not 0 93 29
do 0 93 29
than 0 93 29
to 0 93 29
face 0 93 29
an 1 93 29
insouciant 1 93 29
American 1 93 29
jury. 1 93 29

Remember 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
jury 0 93 30
that 0 93 30
condemned 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
survivors 0 93 30
of 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
FBI’s 0 93 30

locked 0 93 30
away 0 93 30
for 0 93 30
many 0 93 30
years 0 93 30
so 0 93 30
that 0 93 30
they 0 93 30
could 0 93 30
not 0 93 30
talk 0 93 30
and 0 93 30
tell 0 93 30
of 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
mass 0 93 30
murder 0 93 30
inflicted 0 93 30
on 0 93 30
a 0 93 30
religious 0 93 30
group 0 93 30
by 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
FBI. 0 93 30

It 0 93 31
is 0 93 31
unclear 0 93 31
how 0 93 31
much 0 93 31
of 0 93 31
a 0 93 31
crime 0 93 31
it 0 93 31
can 0 93 31
be 0 93 31
to 0 93 31
misrepresent 0 93 31
your 0 93 31
financial 0 93 31
position 0 93 31
on 0 93 31
a 0 93 31
loan 0 93 31
application 0 93 31
when 0 93 31
one 0 93 31
of 0 93 31
the 0 93 31
causes 0 93 31
of 0 93 31
the 0 93 31
mortgage-backed 0 93 31
derivative 0 93 31
crisis 0 93 31
was 0 93 31
the 0 93 31
misrepresentation 0 93 31
of 0 93 31

Instead 0 93 32
of 0 93 32
prosecution, 0 93 32
Washington 0 93 32
relied 0 93 32
on 0 93 32

why 1 93 35

giving 0 93 42
false 0 93 42

against 0 93 42

This 0 93 43
tactic 0 93 43
is 0 93 43
used 0 93 43
every 0 93 43
day 0 93 43
by 0 93 43
state, 0 93 43
local, 0 93 43
and 0 93 43
federal 0 93 43
prosecutors. 0 93 43

Americans 0 93 44
who 0 93 44
believe 0 93 44
the 0 93 44
indictments 0 93 44
and 0 93 44
convictions 0 93 44
are 0 93 44
unaware 0 93 44
that 0 93 44
97% 0 93 44
of 0 93 44
the 0 93 44

punishment. 0 93 44

In 0 93 45
Manafort’s 0 93 45
case 0 93 45
it 0 93 45
didn’t, 0 93 45
or 0 93 45
hasn’t, 0 93 45
worked. 0 93 45

Yet. 0 93 46

Manafort 0 93 47
is 0 93 47
due 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
a 0 93 47
second 0 93 47
trial, 0 93 47
this 0 93 47
time 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
allegely 0 93 47
acting 0 93 47
as 0 93 47
an 0 93 47
unregistered 0 93 47
foreign 0 93 47
agent 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
Ukrainian 0 93 47
interests 0 93 47
and 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
making 0 93 47
false 0 93 47
statements 0 93 47
not 0 93 47
under 0 93 47
oath 0 93 47
to 0 93 47
the 0 93 47
US 0 93 47
government. 0 93 47

Reportedly, 0 93 48
Manafort 0 93 48
is 0 93 48
being 0 93 48
held 0 93 48
in 0 93 48
solitary 0 93 48
confinement, 0 93 48
a 0 93 48
form 0 93 48
of 0 93 48
torture 0 93 48
designed 0 93 48
to 0 93 48
break 0 93 48
a 0 93 48
person’s 0 93 48
spirit. 0 93 48

Like 0 93 49
Manafort’s 0 93 49
first 0 93 49
trial, 0 93 49
his 0 93 49
second 0 93 49
trial 0 93 49
has 0 93 49
nothing 0 93 49
whatsoever 0 93 49
to 0 93 49
do 0 93 49
with 0 93 49
Russiagate, 0 93 49
but 0 93 49
you 0 93 49
will 0 93 49
never 0 93 49
learn 0 93 49
that 0 93 49
from 0 93 49
the 0 93 49
presstitute 0 93 49
media 0 93 49
or 0 93 49
from 0 93 49
the 0 93 49
Democratic 0 93 49
Party. 0 93 49

Manafort 0 93 50
can 0 93 50
still 0 93 50
be 0 93 50
coerced 0 93 50
to 0 93 50
say 0 93 50
something 0 93 50
that 0 93 50
can 0 93 50
be 0 93 50
used 0 93 50
to 0 93 50
drive 0 93 50
Trump 0 93 50
from 0 93 50
office. 0 93 50

What 0 93 51
about 0 93 51
Michael 0 93 51
Cohen, 0 93 51
a 0 93 51
former 0 93 51
attorney 0 93 51
for 0 93 51
Trump? 0 93 51

Mueller 0 93 52
saw 0 93 52
no 0 93 52
value 0 93 52
in 0 93 52
the 0 93 52
Cohen 0 93 52
case 0 93 52
and 0 93 52
passed 0 93 52
it 0 93 52
off 0 93 52
to 0 93 52
a 0 93 52
regular 0 93 52
US 0 93 52
attorney 0 93 52
to 0 93 52
prosecute. 0 93 52

Therefore, 0 93 53
it 0 93 53
would 0 93 53
appear 0 93 53
not 0 93 53
to 0 93 53
be 0 93 53
part 0 93 53
of 0 93 53
the 0 93 53
Russiagate 0 93 53
investigation. 0 93 53

Cohen 0 93 54
avoided 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
jury 0 93 54
and 0 93 54
said 0 93 54
he 0 93 54
was 0 93 54
guilty 0 93 54
of 0 93 54
five 0 93 54
counts 0 93 54
of 0 93 54
personal 0 93 54
income 0 93 54
tax 0 93 54
evasion, 0 93 54
one 0 93 54
count 0 93 54
of 0 93 54
making 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
false 0 93 54
statement 0 93 54
to 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
financial 0 93 54
institution 0 93 54
in 0 93 54
order 0 93 54
to 0 93 54
get 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
loan, 0 93 54
and 0 93 54
two 0 93 54
counts 0 93 54
related 0 93 54
to 0 93 54
illegal 0 93 54
campaign 0 93 54
contributions. 0 93 54

With 0 93 55
regard 0 93 55
to 0 93 55
the 0 93 55
campagin 0 93 55
contributions, 0 93 55
he 0 93 55
contradicted 0 93 55
his 0 93 55
previous 0 93 55
statements. 0 93 55

He 0 93 56
said 0 93 56
that 0 93 56
on 0 93 56
Trump’s 0 93 56
instruction, 0 93 56
he 0 93 56
paid 0 93 56
off 0 93 56
two 0 93 56
women 0 93 56
who 0 93 56
were 0 93 56
claiming 0 93 56
sexual 0 93 56
affairs 0 93 56
with 0 93 56
Trump. 0 93 56

The 1 93 57
intricacies 1 93 57
of 1 93 57
American 1 93 57
laws 1 93 57
relating 1 93 57
to 1 93 57
politics 1 93 57
are 1 93 57
often 1 93 57
unclear. 1 93 57

Apparently, 0 93 58
the 0 93 58
charge 0 93 58
is 0 93 58
that 0 93 58
Cohen 0 93 58
used 0 93 58
monies 0 93 58
raised 0 93 58
for 0 93 58
a 0 93 58
political 0 93 58
campaign 0 93 58
to 0 93 58
pay 0 93 58
off 0 93 58
two 0 93 58
women, 0 93 58
who 0 93 58
saw 0 93 58
and 0 93 58
capitalized 0 93 58
on 0 93 58
an 0 93 58
opportunity 0 93 58
to 0 93 58
extort 0 93 58
Trump 0 93 58
for 0 93 58
money, 0 93 58
and 0 93 58
this 0 93 58
was 0 93 58
an 0 93 58
illegal 0 93 58
use 0 93 58
of 0 93 58
the 0 93 58
money. 0 93 58

Why 1 93 59
a 1 93 59
lawyer 1 93 59
would 1 93 59
pay 1 93 59
off 1 93 59
women, 1 93 59
whose 1 93 59
stories 1 93 59
might 1 93 59
or 1 93 59
might 1 93 59
not 1 93 59
be 1 93 59
true, 1 93 59
in 1 93 59
an 1 93 59
illegal 1 93 59
way 1 93 59
when 1 93 59
his 1 93 59
client 1 93 59
is 1 93 59
a 1 93 59
multi-billionaire 1 93 59
doesn’t 1 93 59
make 1 93 59
much 1 93 59
sense. 1 93 59

But 1 93 60
these 1 93 60
are 1 93 60
not 1 93 60
the 1 93 60
kind 1 93 60
of 1 93 60
questions 1 93 60
that 1 93 60
the 1 93 60
presstitutes 1 93 60
are 1 93 60
interested 1 93 60
in. 1 93 60

Nevertheless, 0 93 61
Cohen’s 0 93 61
plea 0 93 61
is 0 93 61
associated 0 93 61
with 0 93 61
a 0 93 61
case 0 93 61
brought 0 93 61
by 0 93 61

stands 0 93 72
up 0 93 72
for 0 93 72
himself 0 93 72
on 0 93 72
Twitter 0 93 72
— 0 93 72
I 0 93 72

that 0 93 72

but 0 93 72
otherwise 0 93 72
seems 0 93 72
powerless. 0 93 72

Whoever 0 93 73
advised 0 93 73
Trump 0 93 73
to 0 93 73
appoint 0 93 73
Rosenstein, 0 93 73
a 1 93 73
person 1 93 73
committed 1 93 73
to 1 93 73
Trump’s 1 93 73
destruction, 1 93 73
as 0 93 73
deputy 0 93 73
attorney 0 93 73
general, 0 93 73
which 0 93 73
is 0 93 73
the 0 93 73
ruling 0 93 73
position 0 93 73
in 0 93 73
view 0 93 73
of 0 93 73
the 0 93 73
weak 0 93 73

stupid 0 93 73
AG 0 93 73
Sessions 0 93 73
who 0 93 73
recused 0 93 73
himself 0 93 73
from 0 93 73
the 0 93 73
Russiagate 0 93 73
investigation, 0 93 73
intended 0 93 73
Trump’s 0 93 73
destruction. 0 93 73

A 0 93 74
disreputable 0 93 74
person 0 93 74
committed 0 93 74
to 0 93 74
Trump’s 0 93 74
destruction 0 93 74
is 0 93 74
appointed 0 93 74
by 0 93 74
Trump 0 93 74
to 0 93 74
destroy 0 93 74

How 0 93 75
can 0 93 75
a 0 93 75
person 0 93 75
so 0 93 75
unclued 0 93 75
survive? 0 93 75

As 0 93 76
I 0 93 76
wrote 0 93 76
during 0 93 76
the 0 93 76
presidential 0 93 76
campaign, 0 93 76
Trump 0 93 76
has 0 93 76
no 0 93 76
idea 0 93 76
of 0 93 76
Washington 0 93 76
and 0 93 76
no 0 93 76
idea 0 93 76
who 0 93 76
to 0 93 76
appoint 0 93 76
who 0 93 76
would 0 93 76
support 0 93 76
him 0 93 76
rather 0 93 76
than 0 93 76
work 0 93 76
against 0 93 76
him. 0 93 76

Consequently, 0 93 77
he 0 93 77
has 0 93 77
a 0 93 77
government 0 93 77
working 0 93 77
against 0 93 77
him. 0 93 77

Senators 0 93 78
John 0 93 78
McCain 0 93 78
and 0 93 78
Lindsey 0 93 78
Graham 0 93 78
are 0 93 78
working 0 93 78
to 0 93 78
prevent 0 93 78
the 0 93 78
Republican 0 93 78
Party 0 93 78
from 0 93 78
supporting 0 93 78
the 0 93 78
party’s 0 93 78
president. 0 93 78

They 0 93 79
could 0 93 79
easily 0 93 79
succeed. 0 93 79

The 1 93 80
entirety 1 93 80
of 1 93 80
the 1 93 80
House 1 93 80
and 1 93 80
Senate 1 93 80
of 1 93 80
both 1 93 80
parties 1 93 80
is 1 93 80
in 1 93 80

of 1 93 80
the 1 93 80

complex. 1 93 80

What 0 93 81
can 0 93 81
President 0 93 81
Trump 0 93 81
do? 0 93 81

He 0 93 82
could 0 93 82
fight, 0 93 82
not 0 93 82
with 0 93 82
words 0 93 82
on 0 93 82
Twitter, 0 93 82
but 0 93 82
with 0 93 82
the 0 93 82
powers 0 93 82
of 0 93 82
the 0 93 82
presidency. 0 93 82

There 0 93 83

Each 0 93 99

these 0 93 99

and 0 93 99
inexplicable 0 93 99
actions 0 93 99
against 0 93 99
each. 0 93 99

Militarily, 0 93 100
Israel 0 93 100
is 0 93 100
of 0 93 100
no 0 93 100
consequence. 0 93 100

Twice 0 93 101
the 0 93 101
vaunted 0 93 101
Israeli 0 93 101
Army, 0 93 101
capable 0 93 101
of 0 93 101
nothing 0 93 101

murdering 0 93 101
unarmed 0 93 101

Israel 0 93 102
is 0 93 102
too 0 93 102
cowardly 0 93 102
to 0 93 102
try 0 93 102
it 0 93 102
a 0 93 102
third 0 93 102
time, 0 93 102
and 0 93 102
is 0 93 102
relying 0 93 102
on 0 93 102
the 0 93 102

the 0 93 102

The 1 93 103
entire 1 93 103
world 1 93 103
looks 1 93 103
at 1 93 103
America 1 93 103
and 1 93 103
Israel, 1 93 103
and 0 93 103
what 0 93 103
does 0 93 103
the 0 93 103
world 0 93 103
see? 0 93 103

Two 0 93 104
countries, 0 93 104
both 0 93 104
the 0 93 104
result 0 93 104
of 0 93 104
exterminating 0 93 104
the 0 93 104
native 0 93 104
populations, 0 93 104
distrusted 0 93 104
and 0 93 104
universally 0 93 104
hated, 0 93 104
both 0 93 104
of 0 93 104
which 0 93 104
survive 0 93 104
by 0 93 104
purhasing 0 93 104
the 0 93 104
governments 0 93 104
of 0 93 104
other 0 93 104
countries 0 93 104
and 0 93 104
by 0 93 104
endless 0 93 104
lies 0 93 104
that 0 93 104
describe 0 93 104
everyone 0 93 104
but 0 93 104
themselves 0 93 104
and 0 93 104
their 0 93 104
vassals 0 93 104
as 0 93 104
evil 0 93 104
criminals 0 93 104
that 0 93 104
must 0 93 104
be 0 93 104
destroyed. 0 93 104

For 0 93 105
example, 0 93 105
the 0 93 105
Gaza 0 93 105
Strip, 0 93 105
the 0 93 105
largest 0 93 105
concentration 0 93 105
camp 0 93 105
ever 0 93 105
in 0 93 105
the 0 93 105
world, 0 93 105
is 0 93 105
being 0 93 105
systematically 0 93 105
destroyed 0 93 105
along 0 93 105
with 0 93 105
all 0 93 105
life 0 93 105
within 0 93 105
it 0 93 105
by 0 93 105
Israel 0 93 105
under 1 93 105
cover 1 93 105
of 1 93 105
the 1 93 105
obvious 1 93 105
and 1 93 105
transparanent 1 93 105
lie 1 93 105
that 0 93 105
all 0 93 105
within 0 93 105
Gaza 0 93 105
are 0 93 105
terrorists 0 93 105
outfitted 0 93 105
with 0 93 105
bomb 0 93 105
belts 0 93 105
who 0 93 105
are 0 93 105
committed 0 93 105
to 0 93 105
the 0 93 105
destruction 0 93 105
of 0 93 105
Israel. 0 93 105

Not 0 93 106
only 0 93 106
men 0 93 106
of 0 93 106
fighting 0 93 106
age, 0 93 106
but 0 93 106
also 0 93 106
old 0 93 106
men, 0 93 106
pregnant 0 93 106
women, 0 93 106
children, 0 93 106
all 0 93 106
Palestinians 0 93 106
are 0 93 106
being 0 93 106
murdered 0 93 106
by 0 93 106
the 0 93 106
Israeli 0 93 106
military. 0 93 106

The 0 93 107
United 0 93 107
States 0 93 107
Secretary 0 93 107
of 0 93 107
State 0 93 107
agrees 0 93 107
with 0 93 107
Israel 0 93 107
that 0 93 107
all 0 93 107
Palestinians 0 93 107
must 0 93 107
be 0 93 107
destroyed, 0 93 107
the 1 93 107
sooner 1 93 107
the 1 93 107
better. 1 93 107

The 0 93 108
Chinese 0 93 108
are 0 93 108
busy 0 93 108
taking 0 93 108
advantage 0 93 108
of 0 93 108
the 0 93 108
financial 0 93 108
opportunities 0 93 108
that 0 93 108
the 1 93 108
idiot 1 93 108
Americans 1 93 108
forfeit, 0 93 108
but 0 93 108
otherwise 0 93 108
do 0 93 108
not 0 93 108
seem 0 93 108
to 0 93 108
have 0 93 108
any 0 93 108
strategic 0 93 108
sense 0 93 108
of 0 93 108
how 0 93 108
to 0 93 108
proceed 0 93 108
in 0 93 108
the 0 93 108
drama 0 93 108
unfolding 0 93 108
in 0 93 108
front 0 93 108
of 0 93 108
their 0 93 108
eyes. 0 93 108

For 0 93 109
China, 0 93 109
money 0 93 109
is 0 93 109
now 0 93 109
all. 0 93 109

The 0 93 110
Russians 0 93 110
are 0 93 110
infected 0 93 110
with 0 93 110
the 0 93 110
American 0 93 110
propaganda 0 93 110
infused 1 93 110
into 1 93 110
their 1 93 110
veins 1 93 110
during 0 93 110
the 0 93 110
Yeltsin 0 93 110
era 0 93 110
when 0 93 110
Russia 0 93 110
was 0 93 110
an 0 93 110
American 0 93 110
puppet 0 93 110
state. 0 93 110

Slowly, 0 93 111
if 0 93 111
not 0 93 111
surely, 0 93 111
the 0 93 111
Russians 0 93 111
are 0 93 111
coming 0 93 111
to 0 93 111
their 0 93 111
senses 0 93 111
and 0 93 111
realizing 0 93 111
that 0 93 111
they 0 93 111
have 0 93 111
no 0 93 111
American 0 93 111
“partner.” 0 93 111

If 1 93 112
Trump 1 93 112
is 1 93 112
defeated 1 93 112
and 1 93 112
moved 1 93 112
off 1 93 112
the 1 93 112
table, 1 93 112
what 1 93 112
happens 1 93 112
when 1 93 112
Russia 1 93 112
and 1 93 112
China 1 93 112
finally 1 93 112
realize 1 93 112
that 1 93 112
there 1 93 112
is 1 93 112
to 1 93 112
be 1 93 112
no 1 93 112
conciliation 1 93 112
with 1 93 112
Washington? 1 93 112

When 1 93 113
all 1 93 113
the 1 93 113
false 1 93 113
hopes 1 93 113
and 1 93 113
bets 1 93 113
of 1 93 113
the 1 93 113
Russian 1 93 113
and 1 93 113
Chinese 1 93 113
governments 1 93 113
of 1 93 113
conciliation 1 93 113
on 1 93 113
the 1 93 113
basis 1 93 113
of 1 93 113
mutual 1 93 113
economic 1 93 113
interests 1 93 113
come 1 93 113
to 1 93 113
naught, 1 93 113
what 1 93 113
happens? 1 93 113

It 1 93 114
will 1 93 114
be 1 93 114
the 1 93 114
end 1 93 114
of 1 93 114
life 1 93 114
on 1 93 114
earth. 1 93 114

The 0 93 115
Russiagate 0 93 115
“investigation” 0 93 115
appears 0 93 115
to 0 93 115
be 0 93 115
timed 0 93 115
to 0 93 115
influence 0 93 115
the 0 93 115
midterm 0 93 115
elections 0 93 115
with 0 93 115
unsubstantiated 0 93 115
accusations 0 93 115
made 0 93 115
just 0 93 115
before 0 93 115
the 0 93 115
elections 0 93 115
in 0 93 115
an 0 93 115
attempt 0 93 115
to 0 93 115
produce 0 93 115
a 0 93 115
Democratic 0 93 115
Congress 0 93 115
that 0 93 115
would 0 93 115
impeach 0 93 115
President 0 93 115
Trump 0 93 115
on 0 93 115
false 0 93 115
charges. 0 93 115

The 0 93 116
presstitutes 0 93 116
would 0 93 116
cover 0 93 116
up 0 93 116
the 0 93 116
frameup. 0 93 116

In 0 93 117
other 0 93 117
words, 0 93 117
the 0 93 117
real 0 93 117
election 0 93 117
meddling 0 93 117
is 0 93 117
being 0 93 117
done 0 93 117
by 0 93 117
the 0 93 117
Russiagate 0 93 117
“investigation.” 0 93 117
See 0 93 117
here 0 93 117
and 0 93 117
here. 0 93 117

Such 1 93 118
an 1 93 118
impeachment 1 93 118
would 1 93 118
be 1 93 118
a 1 93 118
coup. 1 93 118

The 1 93 119
consequence 1 93 119
would 1 93 119
be 1 93 119
deep 1 93 119
and 1 93 119
permanent 1 93 119
divisions 1 93 119
in 1 93 119
American 1 93 119
political 1 93 119
life 1 93 119
and 1 93 119
more 1 93 119
rabid 1 93 119
Russiaphobia 1 93 119
that 1 93 119
would 1 93 119
result 1 93 119
in 1 93 119
war. 1 93 119

The 0 93 120
danger 0 93 120
is 0 93 120
real 0 93 120
that 0 93 120
the 0 93 120
Democrats’ 0 93 120
Russiagate 0 93 120

by 0 93 120
the 0 93 120
