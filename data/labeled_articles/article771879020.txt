Use. 0 97 16

In 0 97 17
2013, 0 97 17
Wilson 0 97 17
had 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
information 0 97 17
on 0 97 17
how 0 97 17
to 0 97 17
build 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
gun 0 97 17
removed 0 97 17
from 0 97 17
public 0 97 17
access 0 97 17
at 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
request 0 97 17
of 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
United 0 97 17
States 0 97 17
Department 0 97 17
of 0 97 17
Defense 0 97 17
Trade 0 97 17
Controls. 0 97 17

According 0 97 18
to 0 97 18
Wilson, 0 97 18
they 0 97 18
seized 0 97 18
control 0 97 18
of 0 97 18
the 0 97 18
information. 0 97 18

Clearly, 1 97 19
they 1 97 19
were 1 97 19
acting 1 97 19
unlawfully 1 97 19
when 1 97 19
they 1 97 19
did 1 97 19
what 1 97 19
they 1 97 19
did. 1 97 19

"I 0 97 20
thought 1 97 20
my 1 97 20
life 1 97 20
was 1 97 20
over," 1 97 20
Wilson 0 97 20
said 0 97 20
after 0 97 20
his 0 97 20
attorneys 0 97 20
told 0 97 20
him 0 97 20
he 0 97 20
didn't 0 97 20
fair 0 97 20
well 0 97 20
going 0 97 20
up 0 97 20
against 0 97 20
the 0 97 20
government. 0 97 20

So, 0 97 21
what 0 97 21
did 0 97 21
he 0 97 21
do? 0 97 21

He 0 97 22
fired 0 97 22
them, 0 97 22
and 0 97 22
got 0 97 22
a 0 97 22
new 0 97 22
legal 0 97 22
team. 0 97 22

Wired 0 97 23
has 0 97 23
the 0 97 23
story. 0 97 23

Instead, 0 97 24
Wilson 0 97 24
has 0 97 24
spent 0 97 24
the 0 97 24
last 0 97 24
years 0 97 24
on 0 97 24
an 0 97 24
unlikely 0 97 24
project 0 97 24
for 0 97 24
an 1 97 24
anarchist: 1 97 24
Not 0 97 24
simply 0 97 24
defying 0 97 24
or 0 97 24
skirting 0 97 24
the 0 97 24
law 0 97 24
but 0 97 24
taking 0 97 24
it 0 97 24
to 0 97 24
court 0 97 24
and 0 97 24
changing 0 97 24
it. 0 97 24

In 0 97 25
doing 0 97 25
so, 0 97 25
he 0 97 25
has 0 97 25
now 0 97 25
not 0 97 25
only 0 97 25
defeated 0 97 25
a 0 97 25
legal 0 97 25
threat 0 97 25
to 0 97 25
his 0 97 25
own 0 97 25
highly 0 97 25
controversial 0 97 25
gunsmithing 0 97 25
project. 0 97 25

He 0 97 26
may 0 97 26
have 0 97 26
also 0 97 26
unlocked 0 97 26
a 0 97 26
new 0 97 26
era 0 97 26
of 0 97 26
digital 0 97 26
DIY 0 97 26
gunmaking 0 97 26
that 0 97 26
further 0 97 26
undermines 0 97 26
gun 0 97 26
control 0 97 26
across 0 97 26
the 0 97 26
United 0 97 26
States 0 97 26
and 0 97 26
the 0 97 26
world—another 0 97 26
step 0 97 26
toward 0 97 26
Wilson's 0 97 26
imagined 0 97 26
future 0 97 26
where 0 97 26
anyone 1 97 26
can 1 97 26
make 1 97 26
a 1 97 26
deadly 1 97 26
weapon 1 97 26
at 1 97 26
home 1 97 26
with 1 97 26
no 1 97 26
government 1 97 26
oversight. 1 97 26

the 0 97 27
Department 0 97 27
of 0 97 27

quietly 0 97 27

a 0 97 27
settlement 0 97 27
to 0 97 27
end 0 97 27
a 0 97 27

and 0 97 27
a 0 97 27

against 0 97 27

Wilson 0 97 28
and 0 97 28
his 0 97 28
team 0 97 28
of 0 97 28
lawyers 0 97 28
focused 0 97 28
their 0 97 28
legal 0 97 28
argument 0 97 28
on 0 97 28
a 0 97 28
free 0 97 28

claim: 0 97 28
They 0 97 28
pointed 0 97 28
out 0 97 28
that 0 97 28
by 0 97 28
forbidding 0 97 28
Wilson 0 97 28

the 0 97 28
State 0 97 28

not 0 97 28

violating 0 97 28
his 0 97 28
right 0 97 28

Wilson 0 97 29

What 0 97 48
does 0 97 48
all 0 97 48
this 0 97 48
mean? 0 97 48

Well, 0 97 49
it's 0 97 49
pretty 0 97 49
simple, 0 97 49
and 1 97 49
I 1 97 49
highly 1 97 49
recommend 1 97 49
the 1 97 49
Wired 1 97 49
article, 1 97 49
which 1 97 49
is 1 97 49
quite 1 97 49
lengthy 1 97 49
and 1 97 49
has 1 97 49
lots 1 97 49
of 1 97 49
information, 1 97 49
but 0 97 49
what 0 97 49
this 0 97 49
does 0 97 49
is 0 97 49
demonstrates 0 97 49
that 0 97 49
the 1 97 49
genie 1 97 49
is 1 97 49
out 1 97 49
of 1 97 49
the 1 97 49
bottle 1 97 49
and 0 97 49
there 0 97 49
is 0 97 49
just 0 97 49
no 0 97 49
way 0 97 49
for 0 97 49
gun 1 97 49
grabbing 1 97 49
Communists 1 97 49
the 0 97 49
world 0 97 49
over 0 97 49
to 0 97 49
be 0 97 49
able 0 97 49
to 0 97 49
truly 0 97 49
enforce 0 97 49
their 0 97 49
unlawful 0 97 49
acts 0 97 49
of 0 97 49
fun 1 97 49
gun 1 97 49
confiscation. 1 97 49

Why? 0 97 50

Because 0 97 51
now, 0 97 51
anyone 0 97 51
with 0 97 51
access 0 97 51
to 0 97 51
the 0 97 51
internet 0 97 51
and 0 97 51
a 0 97 51
3D 0 97 51
printer 0 97 51
can 0 97 51
print 0 97 51
their 0 97 51
very 0 97 51
own 0 97 51
gun 0 97 51
that 0 97 51
is 0 97 51
unregistered. 0 97 51

That's 0 97 52
right, 0 97 52
and 0 97 52
it's 0 97 52
perfectly 0 97 52
legal 0 97 52
to 0 97 52
do 0 97 52
so. 0 97 52

And 0 97 53
we 0 97 53
aren't 0 97 53
just 0 97 53
talking 0 97 53
a 0 97 53
rigid 0 97 53
looking 0 97 53
one-shot 0 97 53
handgun. 0 97 53

We're 0 97 54
talking 0 97 54
ARs, 0 97 54
1911s 0 97 54
and 0 97 54
a 0 97 54
host 0 97 54
of 0 97 54
other 0 97 54
guns. 0 97 54

This 0 97 55
actually 0 97 55
may 0 97 55
end 0 97 55
up 0 97 55
undermining 0 97 55
the 0 97 55
gun 0 97 55
manufacturing 0 97 55
industry 0 97 55
in 0 97 55
the 0 97 55
future, 0 97 55
as 0 97 55
people 0 97 55
will 0 97 55
be 0 97 55
able 0 97 55
to 0 97 55
build 0 97 55
their 0 97 55
own 0 97 55
guns 0 97 55
at 0 97 55
home 0 97 55
in 0 97 55
a 0 97 55
similar 0 97 55
manner 0 97 55
to 0 97 55
how 0 97 55
the 0 97 55
internet 0 97 55
has 0 97 55
had 0 97 55
a 0 97 55
dramatic 0 97 55

on 0 97 55
the 0 97 55

Wilson 0 97 56
boasted 1 97 56
that 0 97 56
his 1 97 56
efforts 1 97 56
have 1 97 56
officially 1 97 56
killed 1 97 56
gun 1 97 56
control. 1 97 56

"I 0 97 57
barely 1 97 57
put 1 97 57
a 1 97 57
million 1 97 57

you 1 97 57
the 1 97 57
Second 1 97 57

forever," 1 97 57
he 0 97 57
told 0 97 57
The 0 97 57
Daily 0 97 57
Wire 0 97 57
in 0 97 57
a 0 97 57
phone 0 97 57
interview. 0 97 57

"What 1 97 58
has 1 97 58
the 1 97 58
NRA 1 97 58
done 1 97 58
for 1 97 58
you 1 97 58
lately?" 1 97 58

I 0 97 59
don't 0 97 59
know 0 97 59
that 0 97 59
I 0 97 59
would 0 97 59
go 0 97 59
quite 0 97 59
that 0 97 59
far, 0 97 59
after 0 97 59
all, 0 97 59
the 0 97 59
settlement 0 97 59
does 0 97 59
state 0 97 59
that 0 97 59
"the 0 97 59
government 0 97 59
expressly 0 97 59
acknowledges 0 97 59
that 0 97 59

to 0 97 59

are 0 97 59
not 0 97 59

Therefore, 0 97 60
the 0 97 60
government 0 97 60
still 0 97 60
believes 0 97 60
it 0 97 60
has 0 97 60
a 0 97 60
right 0 97 60

it 0 97 60
does 0 97 60
not 0 97 60
have 0 97 60
authority 0 97 60
to 0 97 60
do. 0 97 60

"This 0 97 61
doesn’t 0 97 61

the 0 97 61
rifle 0 97 61

it 0 97 61
does 0 97 61
that 0 97 61
in 0 97 61
essence" 0 97 61
he 0 97 61
added. 0 97 61

"The 1 97 62
DNA 1 97 62
