In 0
2013, 0
Wilson 0
had 0
the 0
information 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
build 0
the 0
gun 0
removed 0
from 0
public 0
access 0
at 0
the 0
request 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
Department 0
of 0
Defense 0
Trade 0
Controls. 0

According 0
to 0
Wilson, 0
they 0
seized 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
information. 0

Clearly, 1
they 1
were 1
acting 1
unlawfully 1
when 1
they 1
did 1
what 1
they 1
did. 1

"I 0
thought 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
over," 1
Wilson 0
said 0
after 0
his 0
attorneys 0
told 0
him 0
he 0
didn't 0
fair 0
well 0
going 0
up 0
against 0
the 0
government. 0

So, 0
what 0
did 0
he 0
do? 0

He 0
fired 0
them, 0
and 0
got 0
a 0
new 0
legal 0
team. 0

Wired 0
has 0
the 0
story. 0

Instead, 0
Wilson 0
has 0
spent 0
the 0
last 0
years 0
on 0
an 0
unlikely 0
project 0
for 0
an 1
anarchist: 1
Not 0
simply 0
defying 0
or 0
skirting 0
the 0
law 0
but 0
taking 0
it 0
to 0
court 0
and 0
changing 0
it. 0

In 0
doing 0
so, 0
he 0
has 0
now 0
not 0
only 0
defeated 0
a 0
legal 0
threat 0
to 0
his 0
own 0
highly 0
controversial 0
gunsmithing 0
project. 0

He 0
may 0
have 0
also 0
unlocked 0
a 0
new 0
era 0
of 0
digital 0
DIY 0
gunmaking 0
that 0
further 0
undermines 0
gun 0
control 0
across 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
the 0
world—another 0
step 0
toward 0
Wilson's 0
imagined 0
future 0
where 0
anyone 1
can 1
make 1
a 1
deadly 1
weapon 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
no 1
government 1
oversight. 1

Two 0
months 0
ago, 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
quietly 0
offered 0
Wilson 0
a 0
settlement 0
to 0
end 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
he 0
and 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
co-plaintiffs 0
have 0
pursued 0
since 0
2015 0
against 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
government. 0

Wilson 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
of 0
lawyers 0
focused 0
their 0
legal 0
argument 0
on 0
a 0
free 0
speech 0
claim: 0
They 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
by 0
forbidding 0
Wilson 0
from 0
posting 0
his 0
3-D-printable 0
data, 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
was 0
not 0
only 0
violating 0
his 0
right 0
to 0
bear 0
arms 0
but 0
his 0
right 0
to 0
freely 0
share 0
information. 0

By 0
blurring 0
the 0
line 0
between 0
a 0
gun 0
and 0
a 0
digital 0
file, 0
Wilson 0
had 0
also 0
successfully 0
blurred 0
the 0
lines 0
between 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
and 0
the 0
First. 0

"If 0
code 0
is 0
speech, 0
the 0
constitutional 0
contradictions 0
are 0
evident," 0
Wilson 0
explained 0
to 0
WIRED 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
launched 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
in 0
2015. 0

"So 1
what 1
if 1
this 1
code 1
is 1
a 1
gun?” 1
The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice's 0
surprising 0
settlement, 0
confirmed 0
in 0
court 0
documents 0
earlier 0
this 0
month, 0
essentially 0
surrenders 0
to 0
that 0
argument. 0

It 0
promises 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
export 0
control 0
rules 0
surrounding 0
any 0
firearm 0
below 0
.50 0
caliber—with 0
a 0
few 0
exceptions 0
like 0
fully 0
automatic 0
weapons 0
and 0
rare 0
gun 0
designs 0
that 0
use 0
caseless 0
ammunition—and 0
move 0
their 0
regulation 0
to 0
the 0
Commerce 0
Department, 0
which 0
won't 0
try 0
to 0
police 0
technical 0
data 0
about 0
the 0
guns 0
posted 0
on 0
the 0
public 0
internet. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
it 0
gives 0
Wilson 0
a 0
unique 0
license 0
to 0
publish 0
data 0
about 0
those 0
weapons 0
anywhere 0
he 0
chooses. 0

"I 0
consider 0
it 0
a 0
truly 0
grand 0
thing," 0
Wilson 0
says. 0

"It 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
part 1
of 1
political 1
life 1
that 1
guns 1
are 1
downloadable, 1
and 1
we 1
helped 1
to 1
do 1
that." 1

BELLEVUE, 0

– 0
The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
Foundation 0
have 0
reached 0
a 0
settlement 0
in 0
SAF’s 0
lawsuit 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Cody 0
Wilson 0
and 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
over 0
free 0
speech 0
issues 0
related 0
to 0
3-D 0
files 0
and 0
other 0
information 0
that 0
may 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
manufacture 0
lawful 0
firearms. 0

SAF 0
and 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
had 0
filed 0
suit 0
against 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
under 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration, 0
challenging 0
a 0
May 0
2013 0
attempt 0
to 0
control 0
public 0
speech 0
as 0
an 0
export 0
under 0
the 0
International 0
Traffic 0

Arms 0
Regulations 0
(ITAR), 0
a 1
Cold 1
War-era 1
law 1
intended 1
to 1
control 1
exports 1
of 1
military 1
articles. 1

Under 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
settlement, 0
the 0
government 0
has 0
agreed 0
to 0
waive 0
its 0
prior 0

against 0
the 0
plaintiffs, 0
allowing 0
them 0
to 0
freely 0

the 0
3-D 0

other 0
information 0
at 0
issue. 0

The 0

a 0
significant 0
portion 0
of 0
the 0

as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0

Significantly, 0
the 0
government 0
expressly 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
non-automatic 0
firearms 0
up 0
to 0
.50-caliber 0
– 0
including 0
modern 0
semi-auto 0
sporting 0
rifles 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
popular 0
AR-15 0
and 0
similar 0

– 0
are 0
not 0
inherently 0
military. 0

“Not 0
only 0
is 0
this 0
a 0
First 0
Amendment 0
victory 0
for 0
free 0

it 0
also 0

noted 0
SAF 0
founder 0
and 0
Executive 0
Vice 0
President 0
Alan 0
M. 0
Gottlieb. 0

“For 0
years, 0
anti-gunners 0
have 0
contended 0
that 0
modern 0
semi-automatic 0
sport-utility 0
rifles 0
are 0
so-called 0
‘weapons 0
of 0
war,’ 0
and 0
with 0
this 0
settlement, 0
the 0
government 0
has 0
acknowledged 0
they 0
are 0
nothing 0
of 0
the 0
sort. 0

“Under 0
this 0
settlement,” 0
he 0
continued, 0
“the 0
government 0
will 0
draft 0

the 0

at 0
the 0
center 0
of 0
this 0
case. 0

They 0
will 0
transfer 0
export 0

to 0
the 0
Commerce 0
Department, 0
which 0
does 0
not 0
impose 0

That 0

about 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
gun 0
control. 0

What 0
does 0
all 0
this 0
mean? 0

Well, 0
it's 0
pretty 0
simple, 0
and 1
I 1
highly 1
recommend 1
the 1
Wired 1
article, 1
which 1
is 1
quite 1
lengthy 1
and 1
has 1
lots 1
of 1
information, 1
but 0
what 0
this 0
does 0
is 0
demonstrates 0
that 0
the 1
genie 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bottle 1
and 0
there 0
is 0
just 0
no 0
way 0
for 0
gun 1
grabbing 1
Communists 1
the 0
world 0
over 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
truly 0
enforce 0
their 0
unlawful 0
acts 0
of 0
fun 1
gun 1
confiscation. 1

Why? 0

Because 0
now, 0
anyone 0
with 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
internet 0
and 0
a 0
3D 0
printer 0
can 0
print 0
their 0
very 0
own 0
gun 0
that 0
is 0
unregistered. 0

That's 0
right, 0
and 0
it's 0
perfectly 0
legal 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

And 0
we 0
aren't 0
just 0
talking 0
a 0
rigid 0
looking 0
one-shot 0
handgun. 0

We're 0
talking 0
ARs, 0
1911s 0
and 0
a 0
host 0
of 0
other 0
guns. 0

This 0
actually 0
may 0
end 0
up 0
undermining 0
the 0
gun 0
manufacturing 0
industry 0
in 0
the 0
future, 0
as 0
people 0
will 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
build 0
their 0
own 0
guns 0
at 0
home 0
in 0
a 0
similar 0
manner 0
to 0
how 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
had 0
a 0
dramatic 0
effect 0
on 0
the 0
retail 0
brick 0
and 0
mortar 0
stores. 0

Wilson 0
boasted 1
that 0
his 1
efforts 1
have 1
officially 1
killed 1
gun 1
control. 1

"I 0
barely 1
put 1
a 1
million 1
bucks 1
into 1
this 1
and 1
I 1
got 1
you 1
the 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
forever," 1
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Wire 0
in 0
a 0
phone 0
interview. 0

"What 1
has 1
the 1
NRA 1
done 1
for 1
you 1
lately?" 1

I 0
don't 0
know 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
quite 0
that 0
far, 0
after 0
all, 0
the 0
settlement 0
does 0
state 0
that 0
"the 0
government 0
expressly 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
non-automatic 0
firearms 0
up 0
to 0
.50-caliber 0
– 0
including 0
modern 0
semi-auto 0
sporting 0
rifles 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
popular 0
AR-15 0
and 0
similar 0
firearms 0
– 0
are 0
not 0
inherently 0
military." 0

Therefore, 0
the 0
government 0
still 0
believes 0
it 0
has 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
regulate 0
certain 0
arms, 0
which 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
authority 0
to 0
do. 0

"This 0
doesn’t 0
put 0
the 0
rifle 0
in 0
everyone’s 0
hand, 0
but 0
it 0
does 0
that 0
in 0
essence" 0
he 0
added. 0

"The 1
DNA 1
of 1
our 1
culture 1
is 1
preserved. 1

This 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
pillar 1
in 1
the 1
internet 1
gun 1
culture 1
of 1
tomorrow, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
permanent." 1

This 1
is 1
a 1
huge 1
milestone 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
our 1
county, 1
and 0
as 0
such, 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
celebrated 0
as 0
a 0
victory. 0
