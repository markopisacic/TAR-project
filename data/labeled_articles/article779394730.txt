The 0 2 1
Pennsylvania 0 2 1
Supreme 0 2 1
Court 0 2 1
on 0 2 1
Tuesday 0 2 1
released 0 2 1
a 0 2 1
sweeping 0 2 1
grand 0 2 1
jury 0 2 1
report 0 2 1
on 0 2 1
sex 0 2 1
abuse 0 2 1
in 0 2 1
the 0 2 1
Catholic 0 2 1
Church, 0 2 1
listing 0 2 1
hundreds 0 2 1
of 0 2 1
accused 0 2 1
clergy 0 2 1
and 0 2 1
detailing 0 2 1
70 0 2 1
years 0 2 1
of 0 2 1
misconduct 0 2 1
and 0 2 1
church 0 2 1
response 0 2 1
across 0 2 1
the 0 2 1
state. 0 2 1

The 0 2 2
release 0 2 2
is 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
culmination 0 2 2
of 0 2 2
an 0 2 2
18-month 0 2 2
probe, 0 2 2
led 0 2 2
by 0 2 2
state 0 2 2
Attorney 0 2 2
General 0 2 2
Josh 0 2 2
Shapiro, 0 2 2
on 0 2 2
six 0 2 2
of 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
state’s 0 2 2
eight 0 2 2
dioceses 0 2 2
— 0 2 2
Harrisburg, 0 2 2
Pittsburgh, 0 2 2
Allentown, 0 2 2
Scranton, 0 2 2
Erie 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
Greensburg 0 2 2
— 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
follows 0 2 2
other 0 2 2
state 0 2 2
grand 0 2 2
jury 0 2 2
reports 0 2 2
that 0 2 2
revealed 0 2 2
abuse 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
coverups 0 2 2
in 0 2 2
two 0 2 2
other 0 2 2
dioceses. 0 2 2

Some 0 2 3
details 0 2 3
and 0 2 3
names 0 2 3
that 0 2 3
might 0 2 3
reveal 0 2 3
the 0 2 3
300 0 2 3
clergy 0 2 3
listed 0 2 3
have 0 2 3
been 0 2 3
redacted 0 2 3
from 0 2 3
the 0 2 3
report. 0 2 3

Legal 0 2 4
challenges 0 2 4
by 0 2 4
clergy 0 2 4
delayed 0 2 4
the 0 2 4
report’s 0 2 4
release, 0 2 4
after 0 2 4
some 0 2 4
said 0 2 4
it 0 2 4
is 0 2 4
a 0 2 4
violation 0 2 4
of 0 2 4
their 0 2 4
constitutional 0 2 4
rights. 0 2 4

Pennsylvania’s 0 2 5
Supreme 0 2 5
Court 0 2 5
ruled 0 2 5
last 0 2 5
month 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
the 0 2 5
report 0 2 5
must 0 2 5
be 0 2 5
released 0 2 5
but 0 2 5
with 0 2 5
some 0 2 5
redaction. 0 2 5

The 0 2 6
report’s 0 2 6
release 0 2 6
begins 0 2 6
an 1 2 6
information 1 2 6
war, 1 2 6
with 0 2 6
prosecutors 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
many 0 2 6
victims 0 2 6
saying 0 2 6
it’s 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
start 0 2 6
of 0 2 6
holding 0 2 6
church 0 2 6
leaders 0 2 6
at 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
top 0 2 6
accountable 0 2 6
for 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
first 0 2 6
time, 0 2 6
while 0 2 6
church 0 2 6
lawyers 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
other 0 2 6
advocates 0 2 6
for 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
institution 0 2 6
say 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
report 0 2 6
depicts 0 2 6
an 0 2 6
era 0 2 6
of 0 2 6
another 0 2 6
century, 0 2 6
unfairly 1 2 6
smearing 1 2 6
today’s 0 2 6
Catholicism 0 2 6
in 0 2 6
Pennsylvania. 0 2 6

The 0 2 7
report 0 2 7
has 0 2 7
helped 0 2 7
renew 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
crisis 0 2 7
many 0 2 7
in 0 2 7
the 0 2 7
church 0 2 7
thought 0 2 7
and 0 2 7
hoped 0 2 7
had 0 2 7
ended 0 2 7
nearly 0 2 7
20 0 2 7
years 0 2 7
ago 0 2 7
after 1 2 7
the 1 2 7
scandal 1 2 7
erupted 1 2 7
in 0 2 7
Boston. 0 2 7

But 1 2 8
recent 1 2 8
abuse-related 1 2 8
scandals, 1 2 8
from 1 2 8
Chile 1 2 8
to 1 2 8
Australia, 1 2 8
have 1 2 8
reopened 1 2 8
wounding 1 2 8
questions 1 2 8
about 1 2 8
accountability 1 2 8
and 1 2 8
whether 1 2 8
church 1 2 8
officials 1 2 8
are 1 2 8
still 1 2 8
covering 1 2 8
up 1 2 8
crimes 1 2 8
at 1 2 8
the 1 2 8
highest 1 2 8
levels. 1 2 8

The 1 2 9
new 1 2 9
wave 1 2 9
of 1 2 9
allegations 1 2 9
has 1 2 9
called 1 2 9
Pope 1 2 9
Francis’s 1 2 9
handling 1 2 9
of 1 2 9
abuse 1 2 9
into 1 2 9
question 1 2 9
as 1 2 9
many 1 2 9
Catholics 1 2 9
look 1 2 9
to 1 2 9
him 1 2 9
to 1 2 9
help 1 2 9
the 1 2 9
church 1 2 9
regain 1 2 9
its 1 2 9
credibility. 1 2 9

The 1 2 10
pope’s 1 2 10
track 1 2 10
record 1 2 10
has 1 2 10
been 1 2 10
mixed, 1 2 10
something 1 2 10
some 1 2 10
outsiders 1 2 10
attribute 1 2 10
to 1 2 10
his 1 2 10
learning 1 2 10
curve 1 2 10
or 1 2 10
shortcomings 1 2 10
and 0 2 10
others 0 2 10
chalk 0 2 10
up 0 2 10
to 0 2 10
resistance 0 2 10
from 0 2 10
a 1 2 10
notoriously 1 2 10
change-averse 1 2 10
institution. 1 2 10

The 0 2 11
Pennsylvania 0 2 11
grand 0 2 11
jury 0 2 11
report 0 2 11
follows 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
resignation 0 2 11
last 0 2 11
month 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
Cardinal 0 2 11
Theodore 0 2 11
McCarrick, 0 2 11
a 1 2 11
towering 1 2 11
figure 1 2 11
in 1 2 11
the 1 2 11
U.S. 1 2 11
church 1 2 11
and 0 2 11
former 0 2 11
D.C. 0 2 11
archbishop 0 2 11
who 0 2 11
was 0 2 11
accused 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
sexually 0 2 11
abusing 0 2 11
minors 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
adults 0 2 11
for 0 2 11
decades. 0 2 11

Both 0 2 12
have 0 2 12
further 0 2 12
polarized 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
church 0 2 12
on 0 2 12
homosexuality, 0 2 12
celibacy 0 2 12
and 0 2 12
whether 0 2 12
laypeople 0 2 12
should 0 2 12
have 0 2 12
more 0 2 12
power. 0 2 12

It 0 2 13
has 0 2 13
also 0 2 13
triggered 0 2 13
debate 0 2 13
about 0 2 13
whether 0 2 13
statutes 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
limitations 0 2 13
should 0 2 13
be 0 2 13
expanded. 0 2 13

“We’re 0 2 14
dealing 0 2 14
with 0 2 14
a 0 2 14
long-term 0 2 14
struggle 0 2 14
not 0 2 14
only 0 2 14
about 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
meaning 0 2 14
of 0 2 14
justice, 0 2 14
but 0 2 14
about 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
meaning 0 2 14
of 0 2 14
memory,” 0 2 14
said 0 2 14
Jason 0 2 14
Berry, 0 2 14
a 0 2 14
reporter 0 2 14
and 0 2 14
author 0 2 14
who 0 2 14
has 0 2 14
covered 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
sexual 0 2 14
abuse 0 2 14
crisis 0 2 14
for 0 2 14
decades. 0 2 14

“And 1 2 15
how 1 2 15
honest 1 2 15
the 1 2 15
church 1 2 15
has 1 2 15
been 1 2 15
about 1 2 15
this 1 2 15
crisis. 1 2 15

Most 1 2 16
bishops, 1 2 16
besides 1 2 16
apologies, 1 2 16
have 1 2 16
not 1 2 16
been 1 2 16
on 1 2 16
the 1 2 16
cutting 1 2 16
edge 1 2 16
of 1 2 16
change.” 1 2 16

Church 0 2 17
officials 0 2 17
began 0 2 17
bracing 0 2 17
for 0 2 17
the 0 2 17
aftermath 0 2 17
of 0 2 17
the 0 2 17
report. 0 2 17

On 0 2 18
Monday, 0 2 18
D.C.’s 0 2 18
archbishop, 0 2 18
Cardinal 0 2 18
Donald 0 2 18
Wuerl, 0 2 18
former 0 2 18
longtime 0 2 18
leader 0 2 18
of 0 2 18
the 0 2 18
Pittsburgh 0 2 18
diocese, 0 2 18
warned 0 2 18
his 0 2 18
priests 0 2 18
in 0 2 18
a 0 2 18
letter 0 2 18
that 0 2 18
the 0 2 18
probe 0 2 18
will 0 2 18
be 0 2 18
“profoundly 1 2 18
disturbing.” 1 2 18

REMNANT 0 2 19
COMMENT: 0 2 19
The 0 2 19
report 0 2 19
also 0 2 19
shows 0 2 19
that 0 2 19
“more 0 2 19
than 0 2 19
90 0 2 19
‘offenders’ 0 2 19
will 0 2 19
be 0 2 19
listed” 0 2 19
in 0 2 19
Donald 0 2 19
Cardinal 0 2 19
Wuerl’s 0 2 19
former 0 2 19
diocese, 0 2 19
which 0 2 19
is 0 2 19
ironic 0 2 19
since 0 2 19
Wuerl 0 2 19
is 0 2 19
one 0 2 19
of 0 2 19
Pope 0 2 19
Francis’s 0 2 19
closest 0 2 19
U.S. 0 2 19
advisers 0 2 19
and 0 2 19
sits 0 2 19
on 0 2 19
the 0 2 19
Vatican’s 0 2 19
bishop 0 2 19
oversight 0 2 19
committee. 0 2 19

Well 1 2 20
played, 1 2 20
Cardinal 1 2 20
Wuerl! 1 2 20

So, 0 2 21
let 0 2 21
me 0 2 21
get 0 2 21
this 0 2 21
straight 0 2 21
(I 0 2 21
know, 1 2 21
lots 1 2 21
of 1 2 21
luck 1 2 21
with 1 2 21
that 1 2 21
one): 1 2 21
These 1 2 21
are 1 2 21
the 1 2 21
people 1 2 21
that 1 2 21
are 1 2 21
going 1 2 21
to 1 2 21
"accompany 1 2 21
us" 1 2 21
and 1 2 21
our 1 2 21
children 1 2 21
in 1 2 21
the 1 2 21
"synodal 1 2 21
Church" 1 2 21
with 1 2 21
its 1 2 21
new 1 2 21
orientation, 1 2 21
overseen 0 2 21
by 0 2 21
a 1 2 21
"God 1 2 21
of 1 2 21
Surprises" 1 2 21
who 1 2 21
is 1 2 21
uber-merciful 1 2 21
and 1 2 21
doesn't 1 2 21
judge, 1 2 21
and 0 2 21
headed 0 2 21
up 0 2 21
by 0 2 21
a 1 2 21
pope 1 2 21
who, 1 2 21
according 1 2 21
to 1 2 21
Father 1 2 21
Thomas 1 2 21
Rosica, 1 2 21
"breaks 1 2 21
Catholic 1 2 21
traditions 1 2 21
whenever 1 2 21
he 1 2 21
wants, 1 2 21
because 1 2 21
he 1 2 21
is 1 2 21
'free 1 2 21
from 1 2 21
disordered 1 2 21
attachments'?'' 1 2 21

You 1 2 22
don't 1 2 22
say! 1 2 22

All 1 2 23
this 1 2 23
and 1 2 23
rampant 1 2 23
homosexuality 1 2 23
in 1 2 23
the 1 2 23
priesthood, 1 2 23
too... 1 2 23
along 1 2 23
with 1 2 23
a 1 2 23
"trivialized 1 2 23
liturgy" 1 2 23
(according 1 2 23
to 1 2 23
Pope 1 2 23
Benedict 1 2 23
XVI) 1 2 23
and 1 2 23
widespread 1 2 23
apostasy 1 2 23
among 1 2 23
the 1 2 23
faithful? 1 2 23

Remind 1 2 24
me 1 2 24
again: 1 2 24
What 1 2 24
exactly 1 2 24
has 1 2 24
Vatican 1 2 24
II 1 2 24
and 1 2 24
the 1 2 24
last 1 2 24
fifty 1 2 24
years 1 2 24
of 1 2 24
aggiornamento 1 2 24
given 1 2 24
us? 1 2 24

Because 1 2 25
I 1 2 25
can't 1 2 25
seem 1 2 25
to 1 2 25
think 1 2 25
of 1 2 25
a 1 2 25
darn 1 2 25
thing, 1 2 25
apart 1 2 25
from 1 2 25
heretical 1 2 25
homilies, 1 2 25
sodomitical 1 2 25
clergy 1 2 25
and 1 2 25
an 1 2 25
increasingly 1 2 25
lavender 1 2 25
liturgy. 1 2 25

You 1 2 26
know 1 2 26
what, 1 2 26
guys? 1 2 26

Thanks, 1 2 27
but 1 2 27
no 1 2 27
thanks. 1 2 27

You 1 2 28
can 1 2 28
take 1 2 28
your 1 2 28
'Church 1 2 28
of 1 2 28
Accompaniment" 1 2 28
to 1 2 28
prison 1 2 28
with 1 2 28
you. 1 2 28

I'd 1 2 29
sooner 1 2 29
let 1 2 29
my 1 2 29
kids 1 2 29
be 1 2 29
accompanied 1 2 29
by 1 2 29
fans 1 2 29
of 1 2 29
the 1 2 29
Oakland 1 2 29
Raiders 1 2 29
than 1 2 29
turn 1 2 29
them 1 2 29
over 1 2 29
to 1 2 29
you... 1 2 29
meaning 0 2 29
no 0 2 29
disrespect 0 2 29
to 0 2 29
fans 0 2 29
of 0 2 29
the 0 2 29
Oakland 0 2 29
Raiders, 0 2 29
of 0 2 29
course. 0 2 29
