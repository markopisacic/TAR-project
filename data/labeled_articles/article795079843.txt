Donald 0 166 3
Trump 0 166 3
on 0 166 3
Monday 0 166 3
ordered 0 166 3
Pompeo 0 166 3
to 0 166 3
rush 1 166 3
to 0 166 3
the 0 166 3

diplomat 0 166 3
quickly 0 166 3
hopped 1 166 3
a 0 166 3

In 0 166 4
his 0 166 4
meetings, 0 166 4
Pompeo 0 166 4
conveyed 0 166 4
“U.S. 0 166 4

concern” 0 166 5
about 0 166 5
Khashoggi’s 0 166 5
disappearance 0 166 5
two 0 166 5
weeks 0 166 5
ago, 0 166 5
the 0 166 5
State 0 166 5

“the 0 166 5
importance 0 166 5
of 0 166 5

and 0 166 5
timely 0 166 5
investigation.” 0 166 5

The 0 166 6

Pompeo 0 166 7
reminded 0 166 7
his 0 166 7
hosts 0 166 7
that 0 166 7
despite 0 166 7
the 0 166 7
numerous 0 166 7
bilateral 0 166 7
issues 0 166 7
the 0 166 7
two 0 166 7
governments 0 166 7
share, 0 166 7
determining 0 166 7
Khashoggi’s 0 166 7
fate 0 166 7
was 0 166 7
the 0 166 7
urgent 0 166 7
purpose 0 166 7
of 0 166 7
this 0 166 7
trip, 0 166 7
she 0 166 7
said. 0 166 7

Khashoggi, 0 166 8
a 0 166 8
prominent 0 166 8
critic 0 166 8
of 0 166 8
the 0 166 8
autocratic 0 166 8
Saudi 0 166 8
leadership, 0 166 8
was 0 166 8
last 0 166 8
seen 0 166 8
entering 0 166 8
the 0 166 8
Saudi 0 166 8
Consulate 0 166 8
in 0 166 8
Istanbul, 0 166 8
Turkey, 0 166 8
on 0 166 8
Oct. 0 166 8
2, 0 166 8
where 0 166 8
he 0 166 8
was 0 166 8
seeking 0 166 8
papers 0 166 8
to 0 166 8
marry 0 166 8
his 0 166 8
fiancée. 0 166 8

Turkish 0 166 9
media 0 166 9
reports, 0 166 9
based 0 166 9
in 0 166 9
part 0 166 9
on 0 166 9
apparent 0 166 9
audio 0 166 9
recordings, 0 166 9
have 0 166 9
said 0 166 9
Khashoggi 0 166 9
was 0 166 9
beaten 1 166 9
to 1 166 9
death 1 166 9
and 1 166 9
then 1 166 9
dismembered 1 166 9
in 0 166 9
the 0 166 9
building. 0 166 9

A 0 166 10
15-member 0 166 10
Saudi 0 166 10
military 0 166 10
team 0 166 10
had 0 166 10
entered 0 166 10
the 0 166 10
consulate 0 166 10
with 0 166 10
a 0 166 10
bone 0 166 10
saw 0 166 10
shortly 0 166 10
before 0 166 10
Khashoggi 0 166 10
arrived, 0 166 10
and 0 166 10
flew 0 166 10
out 0 166 10
of 0 166 10
the 0 166 10
country 0 166 10
soon 0 166 10
after, 0 166 10
the 0 166 10
reports 0 166 10
said. 0 166 10

Saudi 0 166 11
officials 0 166 11
insisted 0 166 11
that 0 166 11
Khashoggi 0 166 11
left 0 166 11
the 0 166 11
consulate 0 166 11
but 0 166 11
have 0 166 11
provided 0 166 11
no 0 166 11
video 0 166 11
or 0 166 11
other 0 166 11
evidence. 0 166 11

They 0 166 12
have 0 166 12
denied 0 166 12
any 0 166 12
responsibility 0 166 12
for 0 166 12
his 0 166 12
disappearance. 0 166 12

Hoping 0 166 13
to 0 166 13
stem 0 166 13
a 0 166 13
growing 0 166 13
furor, 0 166 13
Trump 0 166 13
on 0 166 13
Monday 0 166 13
suggested 0 166 13
“rogue 0 166 13
killers,” 0 166 13
not 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
Saudi 0 166 13
royal 0 166 13
family, 0 166 13
may 0 166 13
have 0 166 13
carried 0 166 13
out 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
murder. 0 166 13

Critics 0 166 14
quickly 0 166 14
said 0 166 14
that 0 166 14
Trump 0 166 14
was 0 166 14
providing 0 166 14
an 0 166 14
excuse 0 166 14
for 0 166 14
the 0 166 14
Saudi 0 166 14
leaders, 0 166 14
and 0 166 14
participating 0 166 14
in 0 166 14
a 0 166 14
cover-up. 0 166 14

That 0 166 15
seemed 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
set 0 166 15
the 0 166 15
stage 0 166 15
for 0 166 15
Saudi 0 166 15
officials 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
find 0 166 15
a 0 166 15
way 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
explain 0 166 15
away 0 166 15
the 0 166 15
alleged 0 166 15
shocking 1 166 15
death. 1 166 15

They 0 166 16
floated 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
idea 0 166 16
later 0 166 16
Monday 0 166 16
of 0 166 16
claiming 0 166 16
that 0 166 16
Khashoggi, 0 166 16
who 0 166 16
wrote 0 166 16
opinion 0 166 16
pieces 0 166 16
for 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
Washington 0 166 16
Post 0 166 16
and 0 166 16
Arab 0 166 16
media, 0 166 16
was 0 166 16
accidentally 0 166 16
killed 0 166 16
in 0 166 16
an 0 166 16
interrogation 0 166 16
gone 0 166 16
awry 0 166 16
inside 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
consulate 0 166 16
— 0 166 16
supposedly 0 166 16
without 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
approval 0 166 16
of 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
king 0 166 16
or 0 166 16
crown 0 166 16
prince. 0 166 16

Publicly, 0 166 17
Pompeo 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
his 0 166 17
hosts 0 166 17
looked 0 166 17
calm 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
friendly 0 166 17
when 0 166 17
they 0 166 17
met 0 166 17
Tuesday 0 166 17
in 0 166 17
Riyadh. 0 166 17

At 0 166 18
one 0 166 18
point, 0 166 18
as 0 166 18
they 0 166 18
greeted 0 166 18
each 0 166 18
other, 0 166 18
Prince 0 166 18
Mohammed 0 166 18
noted 0 166 18
the 0 166 18
two 0 166 18
countries 0 166 18
were 0 166 18
important 0 166 18
allies. 0 166 18

“Absolutely,” 0 166 19
Pompeo 0 166 19
said, 0 166 19
smiling. 0 166 19

The 0 166 20
United 0 166 20
States 0 166 20
long 0 166 20
guaranteed 0 166 20
Saudi 0 166 20
security 0 166 20
in 0 166 20
exchange 0 166 20
for 0 166 20
a 0 166 20
steady 0 166 20
supply 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
oil. 0 166 20

Those 0 166 21
ties 0 166 21
have 0 166 21
frayed 0 166 21
even 0 166 21
as 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
Trump 0 166 21
administration 0 166 21
has 0 166 21
embraced 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
Saudi 0 166 21
rulers 0 166 21
as 0 166 21
a 0 166 21
crucial 0 166 21
regional 0 166 21
ally 0 166 21
in 0 166 21
efforts 0 166 21
to 0 166 21
constrain 0 166 21
Iran 0 166 21
and 0 166 21
to 0 166 21
craft 0 166 21
a 0 166 21
peace 0 166 21
plan 0 166 21
between 0 166 21
Israel 0 166 21
and 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
Palestinians. 0 166 21

The 0 166 22
current 0 166 22
crisis 0 166 22
has 0 166 22
put 0 166 22
those 0 166 22
broader 0 166 22
goals 0 166 22
at 0 166 22
risk, 0 166 22
and 0 166 22
the 0 166 22
White 0 166 22
House 0 166 22
has 0 166 22
scrambled 0 166 22
to 0 166 22
find 0 166 22
a 0 166 22
face-saving 0 166 22
solution 0 166 22
for 0 166 22
the 0 166 22
Saudi 0 166 22
rulers. 0 166 22

Trump 0 166 23
has 0 166 23
said 0 166 23
he 0 166 23
would 0 166 23
impose 0 166 23
“severe” 1 166 23
punishment 0 166 23
if 0 166 23
proof 0 166 23
emerges 0 166 23
that 0 166 23
Saudi 0 166 23
rulers 0 166 23
sanctioned 0 166 23
Khashoggi’s 0 166 23
murder, 0 166 23
but 0 166 23
he 0 166 23
has 0 166 23
not 0 166 23
said 0 166 23
what 0 166 23
that 0 166 23
would 0 166 23
entail. 0 166 23

He 0 166 24
has 0 166 24
ruled 0 166 24
out 0 166 24
cancelling 0 166 24
or 0 166 24
suspending 0 166 24
billions 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
dollars 0 166 24
in 0 166 24
arms 0 166 24
deals 0 166 24
with 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
oil-rich 0 166 24
country. 0 166 24

Many 0 166 25
members 0 166 25
of 0 166 25
Congress 0 166 25
have 0 166 25
demanded 0 166 25
the 0 166 25
White 0 166 25
House 0 166 25
take 0 166 25
tougher 0 166 25
actions, 0 166 25
including 0 166 25
punitive 0 166 25
sanctions 0 166 25
on 0 166 25
Saudi 0 166 25
rulers. 0 166 25

But 0 166 26
Congress 0 166 26
has 0 166 26
taken 0 166 26
no 0 166 26
action 0 166 26
on 0 166 26
its 0 166 26
own. 0 166 26
