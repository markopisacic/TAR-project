Terrorists 0
in 0
Charge? 0

Back 0
in 0
the 0
2008 0
presidential 0
race, 0
I 0
explained 0
to 0
then-candidate 0
Rudy 0
Giuliani 0
the 0
concept 0
of 0
“blowback.” 0
Years 0
of 0
US 0
meddling 0

occupation 0
of 0

the 0
Middle 0
East 0
motivated 0

group 0
of 0
terrorists 0
to 0
carry 0
out 0
attacks 0
against 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
on 0
9/11. 0

They 0
didn’t 0
do 0
it 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
so 0
rich 0
and 0
so 0
free, 0
as 0
the 0
neocons 0
would 0
have 0
us 0
believe. 0

They 0
came 0
over 0
here 0
because 0
we 0
had 0
been 0
killing 0
Muslims 0
“over 0
there” 0
for 0
decades. 0

How 0
do 0
we 0
know 0
this? 0

Well, 0
they 0
told 0
us. 0

Osama 0
bin 0
Laden 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
why 0
al-Qaeda 0
sought 0
to 0
attack 0
the 0
US. 0

They 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
US 0
taking 0
sides 0
in 0
the 0
Israel-Palestine 0
conflict 0
and 0
they 0
didn’t 0
like 0
US 0
troops 0
on 0
their 0
holy 0
land. 0

Why 0
believe 0
a 0
terrorist, 0
some 0
responded. 0

As 0
I 0
explained 0
to 0
Giuliani 0
ten 0
years 0
ago, 0
the 0
concept 0
of 0
“blowback” 0
is 0
well-known 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
intelligence 0
community 0
and 0
particularly 0
by 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Unfortunately, 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
Giuliani 0
never 0
really 0
understood 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
tell 0
him. 0

Like 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
neocons, 0
he 0
either 0
doesn’t 0
get 0
it 0
or 0
doesn’t 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
it. 0

In 0
a 0
recent 0
speech 0
to 0
the 0
MeK 0
– 0
a 0
violent 1
Islamist-Marxist 0
cult 0
that 0
spent 0
two 0
decades 0
on 0
the 0
US 0
terror 0
watch 0
list 0
– 0
Giuliani 0
promised 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
had 0
made 0
“regime 0
change” 0
a 0
priority 0
for 0
Iran. 0

He 0
even 0
told 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
that 0
organization 0
– 0
an 0
organization 0
that 0
has 0
killed 1
dozens 1
of 1
Americans 1
– 0
that 0
Trump 0
would 0
put 0
them 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
Iran! 0

Giuliani 0
shares 0
with 0
numerous 0
other 0
neocons 0
like 0
John 0
Bolton 0
a 0
strong 0
relationship 0
with 0
this 0
group. 0

In 0
fact, 0
both 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Bolton 0
have 0
been 0
on 0
the 0
payroll 0
of 0
the 0
MeK 0
and 0
have 0
received 0
tens 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
dollars 0
to 0
speak 0
to 0
their 0
followers. 0

This 0
is 0
another 0
example 0
of 0
how 0
foreign 0
lobbies 0
and 0
special 0
interest 0
groups 0
maintain 0
an 0
iron 0
grip 0
on 0
our 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Does 1
anyone 1
really 1
think 1
Iran 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
off 1
if 1
Trump 1
puts 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
“former” 1
terrorists 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
country? 1

How 1
did 1
that 1
work 1
in 1
Libya? 1

It’s 0
easy 0
to 0
dismiss 0
the 0
bombastic 0
Giuliani 0
as 0
he 0
speaks 0
to 0
his 0
financial 0
benefactors 0
in 0
the 0
MeK. 0

Unfortunately, 0
however, 0
Giuliani’s 0
claims 0
were 0
confirmed 0
late 0
last 0
week, 0
when 0
the 0
Washington 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
published 0
a 0
three-page 0
policy 0
paper 0
being 0
circulated 0
among 0
National 0
Security 0
Council 0
officials 0
containing 0
plans 0
to 0
spark 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
Iran. 0

The 0
paper 0
suggests 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
focus 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
many 0
ethnic 0
minority 0
groups 0
to 0
spark 0
unrest 0
and 0
an 0
eventual 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
government. 0

This 0
is 0
virtually 0
the 0
same 0
road 0
map 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
has 0
followed 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
Syria, 0
and 0
so 0
on. 0

The 0
results 0
have 0
been 0
unmitigated 0
disaster 1
after 1
disaster. 1

Unleashing 0
terrorists 0
on 0
Iran 0
to 0
overthrow 0
its 0
government 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
illegal 0
and 0
immoral: 0
it’s 0
also 0
incredibly 1
stupid. 1

We 0
know 0
from 0
9/11 0
that 0
blowback 0
is 0
real, 0
even 0
if 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
the 0
neocons 0
refuse 0
to 0
understand 0
it. 0

Iran 0
does 0
not 0
threaten 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Unlike 0
Washington’s 0
Arab 0
allies 0
in 0
the 0
region, 0
Iran 0
actually 0
holds 0
reasonably 0
democratic 0
elections 0
and 0
has 0
a 0
Western-oriented, 0
educated, 0
and 0
very 0
young 0
population. 0

Why 0
not 0
open 0
up 0
to 0
Iran 0
with 0
massive 0
amounts 0
of 0
trade 0
and 0
other 0
contacts? 0

Does 0
anyone 0
(except 0
for 0
the 0
neocons) 0
really 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
better 0
to 0
unleash 0
terrorists 0
on 0
a 0
population 0
than 0
to 0
engage 0
them 0
in 0
trade 0
and 0
travel? 0

We 1
need 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
blowback 1
from 1
President 1
Trump’s 1
fully-neoconized 1
Middle 1
East 1
policy! 1

That’s 1
the 1
real 1
threat! 1
