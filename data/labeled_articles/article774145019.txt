President 0
Trump’s 0
POLICIES 1
have 0
actually 0
made 0
life 0
more 0
difficult 0
for 0
Putin 0
at 0
every 0
turn. 0

Here’s 0
The 0
Federalist’s 0
Mollie 0
Hemingway 0
explaining: 0

Our 0
relationship 0
with 0
Russia 0
is 0
at 0
a 0
significant 0
low 0
point 0
where 0
just 0
having 0
some 0
conversations 0
can 0
lead 0
us 0
to 0
a 0
better 0
outcome. 0

And 0
there 0
are 0
so 0
many 0
important 0
things 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
involved 0
with 0
that 0
we 0
care 0
about, 0
whether 0
it’s 0
Syria, 0
Ukraine, 0
North 0
Korea 0
or 0
nuclear 0
arms. 0

I’m 0
kind 0
of 0
surprised 0
there’s 0
been 0
this 0
much 0
angst 0
over 0
this 0
press 0
conference. 0

Not 0
that 0
he 0
said 0
things 0
the 0
way 0
he 0
should 0
have. 0

President 0
Trump 0
really 0
did 0
mess 0
up 0
with 0
that 0
press 0
conference 0
but 0
I 0
don’t 0
quite 0
know 0
what 0
people 0
want. 0

He 0
actually 0
is 0
pretty 0
tough 1
on 0
Russia. 0

And 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
years, 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
an 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
military 0
budget, 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
an 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
intelligence 0
budget. 0

We 0
are 0
doing 0
NATO 0
exercises 0
in 0
the 0
Baltics. 0

We 0
provided 0
legal 0
aid 0
to 0
Ukraine 0
and 0
Georgia. 0

We’re 0
developing 0
low-yield 0
nuclear 0
weapons. 0

He 0
implemented 0
sanctions 0
that 0
were 0
even 0
stronger 0
than 0
required 0
by 0
Congressional 0
mandate. 0

So 0
if 0
you 0
care 0
about 0
actual 0
actions, 0
I 0
think 0
there’s 0
a 0
lot 0
to 0
be 0
happy 0
about 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
a 0
tough 1
posture 0
towards 0
Russia. 0

People 0
are 0
obsessed 0
about 0
words 0
and 0
they 0
should 0
maybe 0
focus 0
on 0
the 0
actions 0
as 0
well. 0

Former 0
Speaker 0
of 0
the 0
House, 0
Newt 0
Gingrich, 0
concurred 0
with 0
Hemingway 0
arguing 0
that 0
by 0
any 0
standard 0
Trump 0
has 0
been 0
far 0
tougher 0
on 0
Russia 0
than 0
Obama 0
was. 0

First, 0
the 0
very 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
loudest 0
in 0
attacking 0
President 0
Trump 0
about 0
his 0
performance 0
at 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
summit 0
are 0
the 0
people 0
who 0
failed 0
to 0
protect 1
America 1
from 0
Russian 0
meddling 0
in 0
2016. 0

The 0
very 1
intensity 0
and 0
nastiness 1
of 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Brennan 0
and 0
former 0
Director 0
of 0
National 0
Intelligence 0
Clapper 0
is 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
distract 0
attention 0
from 0
their 0
failure 0
to 0
protect 1
America. 1

It 0
was 0
their 0
duty 0
in 0
2016 0
– 0
not 0
candidate 0
Trump’s. 0

Second, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
been 0
far 0
tougher 1
on 0
Russia 0
than 0
President 0
Obama 0
ever 0
dreamed 0
of 0
being. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
is 0
taking 0
real 0
actions 0
designed 0
to 0
weaken 0
Russia 0
and 0
force 0
Putin 0
to 0
change 0
his 0
aggressive 1
behavior. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
has 0
levied 0
tough 1
sanctions 0
on 0
Russia. 0

Also, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
public 0
lecture 0
about 0
Germany 0
not 0
buying 0
natural 0
gas 0
from 0
Russia 0
was 0
aimed 0
at 0
cutting 0
Putin 0
off 0
from 0
hard 0
currency 0
worth 0
tens 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
and 0
further 0
weakening 0
the 0
Russian 0
economy. 0

Furthermore, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
efforts 0
to 0
get 0
our 1
European 0
allies 0
to 0
increase 0
their 0
defense 0
spending 0
has 0
a 0
direct 0
impact 0
on 0
Putin. 0

The 0
stronger 0
NATO 0
is, 0
the 0
less 0
maneuvering 0
room 0
Russia 0
has. 0

Beyond 0
pressuring 0
our 1
allies, 1
consider 0
these 0
specific 0
steps 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
taken 0
against 0
Russia: 0
Where 0
President 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
provide 0
serious 0
weapons 0
to 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
defend 0
themselves 0
(his 0
response 0
was 0
weakness 1
on 1
a 1
pathetic 1
scale), 1
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
approved 0
the 0
sale 0
of 0
offensive 0
weapons 0
to 0
enable 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
increase 0
the 0
cost 0
of 0
Russian 0
aggression. 0

When 0
the 0
Russians 0
used 0
chemical 0
weapons 0
in 0
Great 0
Britain, 0
President 0
Trump 0
joined 0
our 1
allies 1
and 0
expelled 0
60 0
Russian 0
intelligence 0
officers 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

When 0
the 0
Russians 0
retaliated, 0
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
closed 0
the 0
Russian 0
consulate 0
in 0
Seattle. 0

President 0
Trump 0
had 0
previously 0
shuttered 0
the 0
Russian 0
consulate 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco 0
and 0
smaller 0
annexes 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
New 0
York. 0

More 0
than 0
100 0
Russian 0
individuals 0
and 0
companies 0
have 0
been 0
sanctioned 0
for 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
reasons. 0

Despite 0
the 0
hysteria 1
of 0
the 0
left, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
see 0
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
as 0
anything 0
but 0
firm 0
in 0
its 0
dealing 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Nothing 0
done 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
made 0
life 0
easier 0
for 0
the 0
Putin 0
regime 0
in 0
its 0
continued 0
economic 0
decay 0
and 0
diplomatic 0
isolation 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
regime. 0

Any 0
intellectually 0
honest 0
review 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
decade 0
of 0
foreign 0
policy 0
would 0
lead 0
one 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
most 0
assuredly 0
been 0
tougher 1
on 0
Putin 0
and 0
Russia 0
than 0
Obama 0
ever 0
was. 0
