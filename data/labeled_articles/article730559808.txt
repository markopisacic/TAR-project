Dear 0 275 6
Cardinal 0 275 6
Marx 0 275 6
and 0 275 6
dear 0 275 6
Bishop 0 275 6
Bode, 0 275 6
there 1 275 6
is 1 275 6
only 1 275 6
one 1 275 6
Catholic 1 275 6
answer: 1 275 6
No! 1 275 6

And 0 275 7
your 1 275 7
addition 1 275 7
“in 1 275 7
individual 1 275 7
cases” 1 275 7
is 1 275 7
absolutely 1 275 7
worthless, 1 275 7
it 1 275 7
has 1 275 7
no 1 275 7
argumentative 1 275 7
force. 1 275 7

A 0 275 8
clear 0 275 8
statement 0 275 8
by 0 275 8
Bishop 0 275 8
Andreas 0 275 8
Laun 0 275 8
for 0 275 8
Kath.net. 0 275 8

Cardinal 0 275 9
Marx 0 275 9
and 0 275 9
also 0 275 9
Bishop 0 275 9
Bode 0 275 9
have 0 275 9
now 0 275 9
opened 0 275 9
up 0 275 9
to 0 275 9
the 0 275 9
idea 0 275 9
to 0 275 9
offer 0 275 9
homosexual 0 275 9
couples 0 275 9
a 0 275 9
blessing. 0 275 9

Why 1 275 10
not, 1 275 10
one 1 275 10
could 1 275 10
say, 1 275 10
since 1 275 10
the 1 275 10
Church 1 275 10
is 1 275 10
ready 1 275 10
to 1 275 10
bless 1 275 10
nearly 1 275 10
everything 1 275 10
on 1 275 10
the 1 275 10
earth? 1 275 10

Now, 0 275 11
the 0 275 11
Church 0 275 11
especially 0 275 11
blesses 0 275 11
people, 0 275 11
but 0 275 11
also 0 275 11
deeds 0 275 11
and 0 275 11
objects. 0 275 11

The 0 275 12
Jesuit 0 275 12
Father 0 275 12
Eckhard 0 275 12

in 0 275 12
the 0 275 12
Internet 0 275 12
about 0 275 12
Catholic 0 275 12
blessings: 0 275 12

For 0 275 13
Catholics, 0 275 13
really 0 275 13
everything 0 275 13
can 0 275 13
be 0 275 13
blessed, 0 275 13
not 0 275 13
only 0 275 13
places 0 275 13
of 0 275 13
worship, 0 275 13
chalices, 0 275 13
and 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
faithful 0 275 13
after 0 275 13
each 0 275 13
prayer 0 275 13
service 0 275 13
– 0 275 13
whether 0 275 13
after 0 275 13
a 0 275 13
Mass, 0 275 13
or 0 275 13
after 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
prayers 0 275 13
for 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
hours 0 275 13
of 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
day. 0 275 13

The 0 275 14
blessing 0 275 14
is 0 275 14
also 0 275 14
not 0 275 14
limited 0 275 14
to 0 275 14
rosaries 0 275 14
or 0 275 14
religious 0 275 14
medal, 0 275 14
but 0 275 14
one 0 275 14
may 0 275 14
also 0 275 14
bless 0 275 14
cars, 0 275 14
factory 0 275 14
halls, 0 275 14
animals, 0 275 14
herbs, 0 275 14
and 0 275 14
much 0 275 14
more. 0 275 14

Some 0 275 15
blessings 0 275 15
are 0 275 15
only 0 275 15
to 0 275 15
be 0 275 15
made 0 275 15
by 0 275 15
priests 0 275 15
and 0 275 15
deacons, 0 275 15
especially 0 275 15
when 0 275 15
it 0 275 15
is 0 275 15
about 0 275 15
objects 0 275 15
of 0 275 15
worship 0 275 15
such 0 275 15
as 0 275 15
chalices 0 275 15
or 0 275 15
vestments. 0 275 15

But 0 275 16
parents 0 275 16
can 0 275 16
bless 0 275 16
their 0 275 16
children. 0 275 16

The 0 275 17
faithful 0 275 17
may 0 275 17
also 0 275 17
take 0 275 17
home 0 275 17
holy 0 275 17
water 0 275 17
and 0 275 17
sprinkle 0 275 17
it 0 275 17
on 0 275 17
members 0 275 17
of 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
family, 0 275 17
but 0 275 17
also 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
stable 0 275 17
and 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
animals, 0 275 17
thus 0 275 17
blessing 0 275 17
them. 0 275 17

[...] 0 275 18

What 0 275 19
kind 0 275 19
of 0 275 19
hope 0 275 19
is 0 275 19
connected 0 275 19
with 0 275 19
a 0 275 19
blessing? 0 275 19

With 0 275 20
regard 0 275 20
to 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
car, 0 275 20
certainly 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
wish 0 275 20
for 0 275 20
heavenly 0 275 20
protection 0 275 20
– 0 275 20
sometimes 0 275 20
also 0 275 20
expressed 0 275 20
with 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
help 0 275 20
of 0 275 20
a 0 275 20
medal 0 275 20
of 0 275 20
St. 0 275 20
Christopher, 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
patron 0 275 20
saint 0 275 20
of 0 275 20
car 0 275 20
drivers. 0 275 20

With 0 275 21
the 0 275 21
weather 0 275 21
blessing, 0 275 21
one 0 275 21
prays 0 275 21
explicitly 0 275 21
for 0 275 21
protection 0 275 21
against 0 275 21
hail, 0 275 21
lightning 0 275 21
and 0 275 21
drought. 0 275 21

[…] 0 275 22

To 1 275 23
bless 1 275 23
always 1 275 23
means 1 275 23
that 1 275 23
something 1 275 23
shall 1 275 23
flourish, 1 275 23
because 1 275 23
only 1 275 23
then 1 275 23
when 1 275 23
there 1 275 23
is 1 275 23
a 1 275 23
blessing 1 275 23
upon 1 275 23
a 1 275 23
cause 1 275 23
or 1 275 23
a 1 275 23
project, 1 275 23
will 1 275 23
something 1 275 23
good 1 275 23
come 1 275 23
out 1 275 23
of 1 275 23
it. 1 275 23

The 0 275 24
blessing 0 275 24
comes 0 275 24
from 0 275 24
God, 0 275 24
He 0 275 24
is 0 275 24
being 0 275 24
addressed 0 275 24
in 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
form 0 275 24
of 0 275 24
a 0 275 24
request; 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
it 0 275 24
is 0 275 24
given 0 275 24
to 0 275 24
people, 0 275 24
objects, 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
buildings, 0 275 24
with 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
help 0 275 24
of 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
sign 0 275 24
of 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
cross, 0 275 24
holy 0 275 24
water, 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
incense. 0 275 24

[…] 0 275 25

But 0 275 26
now 0 275 26
concerning 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
question 0 275 26
of 0 275 26
Cardinal 0 275 26
Marx, 0 275 26
and 0 275 26
not 0 275 26
a 0 275 26
few 0 275 26
of 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
priests, 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
answer 0 275 26
is 0 275 26
simple: 0 275 26
one 0 275 26
may 0 275 26
ask 0 275 26
for 0 275 26
God's 0 275 26
blessing 0 275 26
for 0 275 26
sinners, 0 275 26
but 0 275 26
not 0 275 26
for 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
sin. 0 275 26

That 1 275 27
is 1 275 27
to 1 275 27
say, 1 275 27
one 1 275 27
could 1 275 27
not 1 275 27
consecrate 1 275 27
a 1 275 27
brothel, 1 275 27
one 1 275 27
could 1 275 27
not 1 275 27
bless 1 275 27
a 1 275 27
concentration 1 275 27
camp 1 275 27
or 1 275 27
weapons 1 275 27
which 1 275 27
are 1 275 27
not 1 275 27
explicitly 1 275 27
ordained 1 275 27
for 1 275 27
hunting 1 275 27
or 1 275 27
for 1 275 27
legitimate 1 275 27
self-defense. 1 275 27

Therefore 0 275 28
it 0 275 28
is 0 275 28
clear 0 275 28
that 0 275 28
one 1 275 28
may 1 275 28
not 1 275 28
bless 1 275 28
a 1 275 28
relationship 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
is 1 275 28
sinful; 1 275 28
[one 1 275 28
may 1 275 28
not 1 275 28
bless] 1 275 28
the 1 275 28
mafia; 1 275 28
no 1 275 28
blessing 1 275 28
for 1 275 28
organizations 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
institutions 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
promote 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
procure 1 275 28
abortions 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
propagate 1 275 28
ideologies 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
are 1 275 28
against 1 275 28
the 1 275 28
Faith, 1 275 28
antisemitic 1 275 28
contents, 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
other 1 275 28
forms 1 275 28
of 1 275 28
racist 1 275 28
thought. 1 275 28

If 1 275 29
one 1 275 29
considers 1 275 29
and 1 275 29
weighs 1 275 29
this 1 275 29
matter, 1 275 29
one 1 275 29
knows: 1 275 29
one 1 275 29
may 1 275 29
not 1 275 29
bless 1 275 29
a 1 275 29
union 1 275 29
of 1 275 29
two 1 275 29
homosexual 1 275 29
men 1 275 29
or 1 275 29
of 1 275 29
lesbian 1 275 29
women. 1 275 29

Of 0 275 30
course 0 275 30
[one 0 275 30
could 0 275 30
bless] 0 275 30
two 0 275 30
men 0 275 30
or 0 275 30
women 0 275 30
who 0 275 30
are 0 275 30
de 0 275 30
facto 0 275 30
homosexual, 0 275 30
and 0 275 30
that 0 275 30
it 0 275 30
what 0 275 30
happens 0 275 30
in 0 275 30
each 0 275 30
Holy 0 275 30
Mass 0 275 30
which 0 275 30
is 0 275 30
being 0 275 30
attended 0 275 30
by 0 275 30
them. 0 275 30

This 0 275 31
blessing 0 275 31
– 0 275 31
which 0 275 31
is 0 275 31
not 0 275 31
related 0 275 31
to 0 275 31
their 0 275 31
acts 0 275 31
– 0 275 31
is 0 275 31
being 0 275 31
received 0 275 31
also 0 275 31
by 0 275 31
all 0 275 31
the 0 275 31
other 0 275 31
sinners, 0 275 31
and 0 275 31
the 0 275 31
Church 0 275 31
thereby 0 275 31
hopes 0 275 31
that 0 275 31
they 0 275 31
will 0 275 31
convert 0 275 31
under 0 275 31
the 0 275 31
influence 0 275 31
of 0 275 31
God's 0 275 31
Grace! 0 275 31

This 1 275 32
position 1 275 32
which 1 275 32
is 1 275 32
really 1 275 32
simple 1 275 32
and 1 275 32
easily 1 275 32
to 1 275 32
be 1 275 32
understood 1 275 32
has 0 275 32
been 0 275 32
clearly 0 275 32
and 0 275 32
convincingly 0 275 32
presented 0 275 32
– 0 275 32
since 0 275 32
the 0 275 32
statement 0 275 32
of 0 275 32
the 0 275 32
two 0 275 32
bishops 0 275 32
[Marx 0 275 32
and 0 275 32
Bode] 0 275 32
– 0 275 32

I 1 275 33
am 1 275 33
sure 1 275 33
there 1 275 33
are 1 275 33
many 1 275 33
many 1 275 33
others, 1 275 33
too, 1 275 33
who 1 275 33
think 1 275 33
alike, 1 275 33
but 1 275 33
whom 1 275 33
I 1 275 33
do 1 275 33
not 1 275 33
know. 1 275 33

Dear 1 275 34
Cardinal 1 275 34
Marx 1 275 34
and 1 275 34
dear 1 275 34
Bishop 1 275 34
Bode, 1 275 34
there 1 275 34
is 1 275 34
only 1 275 34
one 1 275 34
Catholic 1 275 34
answer: 1 275 34
No! 1 275 34

And 1 275 35
your 1 275 35
addition 1 275 35
“in 1 275 35
individual 1 275 35
cases” 1 275 35
is 1 275 35
absolutely 1 275 35
worthless, 1 275 35
it 1 275 35
has 1 275 35
no 1 275 35
argumentative 1 275 35
force. 1 275 35

What 0 275 36
would 0 275 36
St. 0 275 36
John 0 275 36
the 0 275 36
Baptist 0 275 36
have 0 275 36
said 0 275 36
if 0 275 36
Herod, 0 275 36
taking 0 275 36
for 0 275 36
himself 0 275 36
his 0 275 36
brother's 0 275 36
wife, 0 275 36
would 0 275 36
have 0 275 36
excusingly 0 275 36
called 0 275 36
himself 0 275 36
an 0 275 36
“individual 0 275 36
case”! 0 275 36

The 0 275 37
idea 0 275 37
to 0 275 37
bless 0 275 37
sinful 0 275 37
conduct 0 275 37
is 0 275 37
really 0 275 37
what 0 275 37
Isaiah 0 275 37
described 0 275 37
quite 0 275 37
vividly, 0 275 37
as 0 275 37
follows: 0 275 37
“Woe 0 275 37
to 0 275 37
you 0 275 37
that 0 275 37
call 0 275 37
evil 0 275 37
good, 0 275 37
and 0 275 37
good 0 275 37
evil: 0 275 37
that 0 275 37
put 0 275 37
darkness 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
light, 0 275 37
and 0 275 37
light 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
darkness: 0 275 37
that 0 275 37
put 0 275 37
bitter 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
sweet, 0 275 37
and 0 275 37
sweet 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
bitter.” 0 275 37
[Isaiah 0 275 37
5:20] 0 275 37

Is 0 275 38
this 0 275 38
not 0 275 38
exactly 0 275 38
what 0 275 38
Cardinal 0 275 38
Marx 0 275 38
– 0 275 38
and 0 275 38
others 0 275 38
who 0 275 38
are 0 275 38
thinking 0 275 38
like 0 275 38
him 0 275 38
– 0 275 38
are 0 275 38
doing? 0 275 38

If 0 275 39
one 0 275 39
were 0 275 39
to 0 275 39
place 0 275 39
on 0 275 39
a 0 275 39
bottle 0 275 39
of 0 275 39
sour 0 275 39
cucumbers 0 275 39
a 0 275 39
tag 0 275 39
“honey,” 0 275 39
the 0 275 39
cucumbers 0 275 39
still 0 275 39
remain 0 275 39
sour! 0 275 39

Even 0 275 40
blessing 0 275 40
bishops 0 275 40
cannot 0 275 40
change 0 275 40
that. 0 275 40

Nor 0 275 41
can 0 275 41
the 0 275 41
pope, 0 275 41
in 0 275 41
calling 0 275 41
for 0 275 41
a 0 275 41
cultural 0 275 41
revolution, 0 275 41
especially 0 275 41
since 0 275 41
he 0 275 41
does 0 275 41
not 0 275 41
explain 0 275 41
what 0 275 41
he 0 275 41
exactly 0 275 41
means 0 275 41
by 0 275 41
it. 0 275 41

He 0 275 42
says 0 275 42
that 0 275 42
he 0 275 42
“allows 0 275 42
himself” 0 275 42
to 0 275 42
talk 0 275 42
like 0 275 42
that 0 275 42
– 0 275 42
but 1 275 42
if 1 275 42
one 1 275 42
dares 1 275 42
something, 1 275 42
one 1 275 42
might 1 275 42
win, 1 275 42
but 1 275 42
one 1 275 42
also 1 275 42
can 1 275 42
perish. 1 275 42

That 0 275 43
seems 0 275 43
to 0 275 43
catch 0 275 43
on 0 275 43
these 0 275 43
days. 0 275 43

For 0 275 44
example, 0 275 44
the 0 275 44
Italian 0 275 44
moral 0 275 44
theologian, 0 275 44
Maurizio 0 275 44
Chiodi, 0 275 44
recently 0 275 44
claimed 0 275 44
in 0 275 44
his 0 275 44
talk 0 275 44
at 0 275 44
the 0 275 44
Gregorian 0 275 44
Pontifical 0 275 44
University 0 275 44
that 0 275 44
contraception 0 275 44
is 0 275 44
sometimes 0 275 44
not 0 275 44
only 0 275 44
not 0 275 44
forbidden, 0 275 44
but 0 275 44
even 0 275 44
demanded! 0 275 44

To 1 275 45
contradict 1 275 45
two 1 275 45
popes 1 275 45
– 1 275 45
whom 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
Church 1 275 45
has 1 275 45
already 1 275 45
“beatified” 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
one 1 275 45
and 1 275 45
“canonized” 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
other 1 275 45
– 1 275 45
so 1 275 45
shortly 1 275 45
after 1 275 45
their 1 275 45
deaths, 1 275 45
and 1 275 45
in 1 275 45
such 1 275 45
a 1 275 45
radical 1 275 45
and 1 275 45
open 1 275 45
manner, 1 275 45
probably 1 275 45
has 1 275 45
never 1 275 45
happened 1 275 45
before 1 275 45
in 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
Church's 1 275 45
history. 1 275 45

Isaiah 1 275 46
says 1 275 46
that 1 275 46
such 1 275 46
people 1 275 46
draw 1 275 46
unto 1 275 46
them 1 275 46
God's 1 275 46
punishment, 1 275 46
with 1 275 46
thick 1 275 46
cords! 1 275 46

Nevertheless, 0 275 47
one 0 275 47
should 0 275 47
wish 0 275 47
for 0 275 47
Cardinal 0 275 47
Marx, 0 275 47
Bishop 0 275 47
Bode, 0 275 47
and 0 275 47
Professor 0 275 47
Chiodi 0 275 47
that 0 275 47
they 0 275 47
sleep 0 275 47
well. 0 275 47

Whether 0 275 48
their 0 275 48
conscience 0 275 48
will 0 275 48
allow 0 275 48
it, 0 275 48
is 0 275 48
not 0 275 48
so 0 275 48
certain; 0 275 48
but 0 275 48
if 0 275 48
it 0 275 48
does 0 275 48
not 0 275 48
[allow 0 275 48
it], 0 275 48
it 0 275 48
would 0 275 48
certainly 0 275 48
be 0 275 48
a 0 275 48
hope 0 275 48
for 0 275 48
their 0 275 48
conversion. 0 275 48
