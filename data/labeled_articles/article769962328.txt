you 0 160 1
want 0 160 1

Booth 0 160 1

Before 0 160 2
I 0 160 2
begin, 0 160 2
I 0 160 2
need 0 160 2
to 0 160 2
make 0 160 2
clear 0 160 2
that 0 160 2
the 0 160 2
best 0 160 2
leaders 0 160 2
are 0 160 2
the 0 160 2
best 0 160 2
followers, 0 160 2
and 0 160 2
that 0 160 2
of 0 160 2
the 0 160 2
Christ 0 160 2
(John 0 160 2
14:6). 0 160 2

With 0 160 3
that 0 160 3
said, 0 160 3
Isn't 0 160 3
it 0 160 3
funny 0 160 3
how 0 160 3
things 0 160 3
work 0 160 3
in 0 160 3
this 0 160 3
world, 0 160 3
it 1 160 3
seems 1 160 3
like 1 160 3
when 1 160 3
you 1 160 3
do 1 160 3
the 1 160 3
wrong 1 160 3
thing 1 160 3
before 1 160 3
God 1 160 3
and 1 160 3
man, 1 160 3
somehow 1 160 3
people 1 160 3
seem 1 160 3
to 1 160 3
give 1 160 3
it 1 160 3
a 1 160 3
pass. 1 160 3

Yet, 1 160 4
when 1 160 4
you 1 160 4
begin 1 160 4
to 1 160 4
do 1 160 4
the 1 160 4
right 1 160 4
things 1 160 4
and 1 160 4
obey 1 160 4
God 1 160 4
and 1 160 4
love 1 160 4
man 1 160 4
according 1 160 4
to 1 160 4
the 1 160 4
Word 1 160 4
of 1 160 4
God, 1 160 4
all 1 160 4
of 1 160 4
a 1 160 4
sudden, 1 160 4
the 1 160 4
world 1 160 4
acts 1 160 4
like 1 160 4
you're 1 160 4
doing 1 160 4
something 1 160 4
wrong. 1 160 4

they 0 160 5

I 0 160 18
laughingly 0 160 18

I 0 160 19
said, 0 160 19
"Mom, 0 160 19
when 0 160 19
I 0 160 19
was 0 160 19

the 1 160 19

was 0 160 19

anything, 0 160 19
and 0 160 19
no 0 160 19
one 0 160 19
had 0 160 19
a 0 160 19
problem 0 160 19
with 0 160 19
what 0 160 19
I 0 160 19
was 0 160 19
doing, 0 160 19
that 0 160 19
is 0 160 19
until 0 160 19
I 0 160 19
started 0 160 19
to 0 160 19
emulate 0 160 19
(obey) 0 160 19
Jesus 0 160 19
Christ" 0 160 19
(1 0 160 19
John 0 160 19
2:6). 0 160 19

This 0 160 20
reminds 0 160 20
me 0 160 20
of 0 160 20
when 0 160 20
I 0 160 20
gave 0 160 20
a 0 160 20
prayer 0 160 20
at 0 160 20
the 0 160 20
state 0 160 20
capital 0 160 20
in 0 160 20
Minnesota. 0 160 20

After 0 160 21
the 0 160 21
prayer 0 160 21
was 0 160 21
over, 0 160 21
I 0 160 21
had 0 160 21
a 0 160 21
minister 0 160 21
come 0 160 21
up 0 160 21
to 0 160 21
me 0 160 21
and 0 160 21
tell 0 160 21
me 0 160 21
that 0 160 21
I 0 160 21
could 0 160 21
not 0 160 21
be 0 160 21
dropping 0 160 21
the 0 160 21
“J” 0 160 21
(Jesus) 0 160 21
word 0 160 21
in 0 160 21
the 0 160 21
capital. 0 160 21

I 0 160 22
said 0 160 22
that 0 160 22
the 1 160 22
reason 1 160 22
I 1 160 22
dropped 1 160 22
the 1 160 22
“J” 1 160 22
word 1 160 22
was 1 160 22
because 1 160 22
you 1 160 22
haven’t 1 160 22
in 1 160 22
40 1 160 22
years 1 160 22
(Romans 0 160 22

of 0 160 23
public 0 160 23
high 0 160 23
schools 0 160 23
across 0 160 23
the 0 160 23

we 0 160 23
have 0 160 23
been 0 160 23
going 0 160 23
into 0 160 23

to 0 160 23
who 0 160 23
we 0 160 23
are, 0 160 23
and 0 160 23
not 0 160 23
what 0 160 23
the 1 160 23
revisionists 1 160 23
and 1 160 23
propagandists 1 160 23
would 0 160 23
have 0 160 23
them 0 160 23
believe 0 160 23
that 0 160 23
we 0 160 23
are. 0 160 23

We 0 160 24
have 0 160 24
shown 0 160 24
the 0 160 24
young 0 160 24
people 0 160 24
that 0 160 24
abortion 1 160 24
is 1 160 24
murder 1 160 24
and 1 160 24
that 1 160 24
58 1 160 24
million 1 160 24
babies 1 160 24
have 1 160 24
been 1 160 24
murdered 1 160 24
since 1 160 24
1973 1 160 24
under 1 160 24
the 1 160 24
guise 1 160 24
of 1 160 24
woman’s 1 160 24
choice 1 160 24
(Proverbs 0 160 24
6:17). 0 160 24

We 1 160 25
got 1 160 25
kicked 1 160 25
out 1 160 25
of 1 160 25
a 1 160 25
public 1 160 25
school 1 160 25
for 1 160 25
re-enforcing 1 160 25
America’s 1 160 25
value’s 1 160 25
by 1 160 25
teaching 1 160 25
the 1 160 25
US 1 160 25
Constitution. 1 160 25

We 0 160 26
have 0 160 26
taught 0 160 26
that 0 160 26
homosexuality 1 160 26
is 1 160 26
an 1 160 26
abomination, 1 160 26
and 0 160 26
how 0 160 26
it 0 160 26
is 0 160 26
a 0 160 26
felony 0 160 26
in 0 160 26
every 0 160 26
state 0 160 26
in 0 160 26
our 0 160 26
union 0 160 26
(Leviticus 0 160 26
18:22; 0 160 26
20:13; 0 160 26
Jude 0 160 26
1:7). 0 160 26

How 0 160 27
true 0 160 27
Scripture 0 160 27
is 0 160 27
when 0 160 27
it 0 160 27
declares: 0 160 27

“Woe 0 160 28
unto 0 160 28
them 0 160 28
that 0 160 28
call 0 160 28
evil 0 160 28
good, 0 160 28
and 0 160 28
good 0 160 28
evil; 0 160 28
that 0 160 28
put 0 160 28
darkness 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
light, 0 160 28
and 0 160 28
light 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
darkness; 0 160 28
that 0 160 28
put 0 160 28
bitter 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
sweet, 0 160 28
and 0 160 28
sweet 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
bitter!" 0 160 28

No 0 160 29
wonder 0 160 29
why 0 160 29
the 1 160 29
reprobates 1 160 29
and 1 160 29
hypocrites 1 160 29
thought 0 160 29
that 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
Christians 0 160 29
who 0 160 29
were 0 160 29
following 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
living 0 160 29
Christ 0 160 29
were 0 160 29
turning 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
world 0 160 29
upside 0 160 29
down 0 160 29
in 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
book 0 160 29
of 0 160 29
Acts. 0 160 29

They 0 160 30
were, 0 160 30
in 0 160 30
fact, 0 160 30
turning 0 160 30
the 0 160 30
world 0 160 30
right 0 160 30
side 0 160 30
up 0 160 30
(Acts 0 160 30
17:6). 0 160 30

Identifying 0 160 31
the 0 160 31
genuine 0 160 31
from 0 160 31
the 0 160 31
counterfeit 0 160 31

Last 0 160 32
week, 0 160 32
I 0 160 32
had 0 160 32
a 0 160 32
woman 0 160 32
come 0 160 32
up 0 160 32
to 0 160 32
me 0 160 32
at 0 160 32
my 0 160 32
last 0 160 32
meeting 0 160 32
in 0 160 32
Amery, 0 160 32
Wisconsin. 0 160 32

She 0 160 33
said 0 160 33
that 0 160 33
she 0 160 33
did 0 160 33
her 0 160 33
research 0 160 33
on 0 160 33
me 0 160 33
and 0 160 33
said 0 160 33
that 0 160 33
the 0 160 33
media 0 160 33
really 0 160 33
attacked 0 160 33
me. 0 160 33

I 0 160 34
responded 0 160 34
with, 0 160 34
"Of 1 160 34
course 1 160 34
they 1 160 34
did, 1 160 34
and 1 160 34
of 1 160 34
course 1 160 34
they 1 160 34
still 1 160 34
do." 1 160 34

They 1 160 35
are 1 160 35
being 1 160 35
exposed 1 160 35
for 1 160 35
who 1 160 35
they 1 160 35
are 1 160 35
and 1 160 35
they 1 160 35
do 1 160 35
not 1 160 35
like 1 160 35
it. 1 160 35

(John 0 160 36
15:22). 0 160 36

I 0 160 37
told 0 160 37
her 0 160 37
that 0 160 37
there 0 160 37
are 0 160 37
too 0 160 37
many 0 160 37
counterfeits, 1 160 37
self-proclaimed 1 160 37
leaders, 1 160 37
out 0 160 37
there 0 160 37
who 1 160 37
care 1 160 37
more 1 160 37
about 1 160 37
saving 1 160 37
face, 1 160 37
than 1 160 37
they 1 160 37
do 1 160 37
the 1 160 37
souls 1 160 37
of 1 160 37
men 1 160 37
(Luke 1 160 37
19:10), 1 160 37
as 1 160 37
well 1 160 37
as 1 160 37
saving 1 160 37
their 1 160 37
country. 1 160 37

Apparently 0 160 38
they 0 160 38
have 0 160 38
a 0 160 38
reputation 0 160 38
to 0 160 38
keep 0 160 38
up. 0 160 38

Philippians 0 160 39
2:7-9 0 160 39

These 0 160 40
are 0 160 40
those 0 160 40
that 0 160 40
sit 0 160 40
behind 0 160 40
the 0 160 40
status 0 160 40
of 0 160 40
some 0 160 40
sort 0 160 40
of 0 160 40
church 0 160 40
or 0 160 40
political 1 160 40
leader 1 160 40
of 1 160 40
the 1 160 40
pack. 1 160 40

Yet, 1 160 41
you 1 160 41
do 1 160 41
not 1 160 41
see 1 160 41
any 1 160 41
warfare 1 160 41
or 1 160 41
opposition 1 160 41
around 1 160 41
them 1 160 41
and 1 160 41
why? 1 160 41

because 1 160 42
they 1 160 42
have 1 160 42
simply 1 160 42
forsaken 1 160 42
the 1 160 42
cross. 1 160 42

There 0 160 43
is 0 160 43
no 0 160 43
absolutes 0 160 43
with 0 160 43
these 0 160 43
people. 0 160 43

They 1 160 44
are 1 160 44
people 1 160 44
pleasers 1 160 44
and 1 160 44
nothing 1 160 44
more. 1 160 44

After 0 160 45
all 0 160 45
you 0 160 45
can 0 160 45
always 0 160 45
tell 0 160 45
what 0 160 45
a 0 160 45
man 0 160 45
stands 0 160 45
for 0 160 45
by 0 160 45
the 0 160 45
enemies 0 160 45
that 0 160 45
he 0 160 45
has. 0 160 45

They 0 160 46
hide 1 160 46
behind 1 160 46
a 1 160 46
microphone 1 160 46
day 0 160 46
after 0 160 46
day. 0 160 46

Yet, 0 160 47
they 0 160 47
fail 0 160 47
to 0 160 47
confront 0 160 47
the 0 160 47
issues 0 160 47
that 0 160 47
needed 0 160 47
to 0 160 47
be 0 160 47
confronted. 0 160 47

The 1 160 48
reason 1 160 48
they 1 160 48
don't 1 160 48
is 1 160 48
because 1 160 48
they 1 160 48
are 1 160 48
guilty 1 160 48
of 1 160 48
what 1 160 48
they 1 160 48
fail 1 160 48
to 1 160 48
confront! 1 160 48

They 0 160 49
are 0 160 49
paper 1 160 49
tigers. 1 160 49

They 1 160 50
can 1 160 50
write 1 160 50
all 1 160 50
big 1 160 50
and 1 160 50
bad 1 160 50
but 1 160 50
when 1 160 50
it 1 160 50
comes 1 160 50
to 1 160 50
what 1 160 50
someone 1 160 50
else 1 160 50
should 1 160 50
do. 1 160 50

However, 1 160 51
when 1 160 51
it 1 160 51
is 1 160 51
time 1 160 51
for 1 160 51
them 1 160 51
to 1 160 51
put 1 160 51
boots 1 160 51
on 1 160 51
the 1 160 51
ground, 1 160 51
they 1 160 51
are 1 160 51
simply 1 160 51
missing 1 160 51
in 1 160 51
action 1 160 51
(MIA). 1 160 51

These 0 160 52
are 0 160 52
willing 0 160 52
to 1 160 52
live 1 160 52
in 1 160 52
the 1 160 52
freest 1 160 52
country 1 160 52
in 1 160 52
the 1 160 52
world 1 160 52
as 0 160 52
long 0 160 52
as 0 160 52
it 0 160 52
is 0 160 52
not 0 160 52
them 0 160 52
that 0 160 52
have 0 160 52
to 0 160 52
sacrifice 0 160 52
to 0 160 52
maintain 0 160 52
it. 0 160 52

There 0 160 53
is 0 160 53
also 0 160 53
a 0 160 53
group 0 160 53
of 0 160 53
people 0 160 53
out 0 160 53
there 0 160 53
that 0 160 53
have 0 160 53
to 0 160 53
be 0 160 53
friends 0 160 53
with 0 160 53
everyone 0 160 53
(and 0 160 53
have 0 160 53
to 0 160 53
apologize 0 160 53
to 0 160 53
any 0 160 53
that 0 160 53
they 0 160 53
may 0 160 53
have 0 160 53
told 0 160 53
the 0 160 53
truth 0 160 53
lest 0 160 53
they 0 160 53
should 0 160 53
convict 1 160 53
them 1 160 53
unto 1 160 53
godly 1 160 53
repentance 1 160 53
(2 0 160 53
Corinthians 0 160 53
7:10) 0 160 53
as 0 160 53
they 0 160 53
congregate 0 160 53
week 0 160 53
after 0 160 53
week 0 160 53
deceiving 1 160 53
themselves 1 160 53
into 1 160 53
believing 1 160 53
that 1 160 53
they 1 160 53
are 1 160 53
demanding 1 160 53
a 1 160 53
lawful 1 160 53
change 1 160 53
just 1 160 53
as 1 160 53
long 1 160 53
as 1 160 53
it 1 160 53
does 1 160 53
not 1 160 53
offend 1 160 53
anyone 1 160 53
(Matthew 0 160 53
5:10). 0 160 53

As 0 160 54
a 0 160 54
matter 0 160 54
of 0 160 54
fact, 0 160 54
these 1 160 54
counterfeits 1 160 54
will 1 160 54
be 1 160 54
the 1 160 54
first 1 160 54
ones 1 160 54
to 1 160 54
get 1 160 54
angry 1 160 54
with 1 160 54
and 1 160 54
denounce 1 160 54
and 1 160 54
attack 1 160 54
the 1 160 54
ones 1 160 54
that 1 160 54
are 1 160 54
sent 1 160 54
by 1 160 54
the 1 160 54
Spirit 1 160 54
of 1 160 54
God 1 160 54
(Galatians 0 160 54
4:29). 0 160 54

Maybe 0 160 55
this 0 160 55
group 0 160 55
of 0 160 55
people 0 160 55
should 0 160 55
ask 0 160 55
their 0 160 55
enemies 0 160 55
for 0 160 55
instructions 0 160 55
as 0 160 55
to 0 160 55
how 0 160 55
change 0 160 55
is 0 160 55
brought 0 160 55
about, 0 160 55
and 0 160 55
in 1 160 55
a 1 160 55
righteous 1 160 55
sense 1 160 55
reverse 1 160 55
the 1 160 55
lawlessness-taking 1 160 55
place 0 160 55
in 0 160 55
this 0 160 55
country 0 160 55
(Matthew 0 160 55
24:12). 0 160 55

These 1 160 56
groups 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
people 1 160 56
are 1 160 56
simply 1 160 56
enemies 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
the 1 160 56
cross 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
Christ 1 160 56
and 1 160 56
know 1 160 56
not 1 160 56
the 1 160 56
power 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
God 1 160 56
unto 1 160 56
salvation 1 160 56
(Philippians 0 160 56
3:18). 0 160 56

Furthermore, 0 160 57
I 0 160 57
said 0 160 57
to 0 160 57
this 0 160 57
woman 0 160 57
that 0 160 57
this 0 160 57
is 0 160 57
how 0 160 57
you 0 160 57
can 0 160 57
tell 0 160 57
who 0 160 57
the 1 160 57
genuine 1 160 57
Christians 1 160 57
are 0 160 57
that 0 160 57
are 0 160 57
in 0 160 57
the 0 160 57
fight 0 160 57
and 0 160 57
those 1 160 57
who 1 160 57
are 1 160 57
counterfeits. 1 160 57

When 0 160 58
the 0 160 58
church 0 160 58
and 0 160 58
the 0 160 58
world 0 160 58
can 0 160 58
jog 1 160 58
comfortably 1 160 58
along 1 160 58
together, 1 160 58
you 0 160 58
can 0 160 58
be 0 160 58
sure 0 160 58
something 0 160 58
is 0 160 58
wrong. 0 160 58

The 0 160 59
world 0 160 59
has 0 160 59
not 0 160 59
compromised—its 0 160 59
spirit 0 160 59
is 0 160 59
exactly 0 160 59
the 0 160 59
same 0 160 59
as 0 160 59
it 0 160 59
ever 0 160 59
was. 0 160 59

If 1 160 60
Christians 1 160 60
were 1 160 60
equally 1 160 60
as 1 160 60
faithful 1 160 60
to 1 160 60
the 1 160 60
Lord, 1 160 60
separated 1 160 60
from 1 160 60
the 1 160 60
world 1 160 60
(2 1 160 60
Corinthians 1 160 60
6:17), 1 160 60
and 1 160 60
living 1 160 60
so 1 160 60
that 1 160 60
their 1 160 60
lives 1 160 60
were 1 160 60
a 1 160 60
reproof 1 160 60
to 1 160 60
all 1 160 60
ungodliness, 1 160 60
the 1 160 60
world 1 160 60
would 1 160 60
hate 1 160 60
them 1 160 60
as 1 160 60
much 1 160 60
as 1 160 60
it 1 160 60
ever 1 160 60
did. 1 160 60

(John 0 160 61

It 0 160 61
is 0 160 61
the 0 160 61
church 0 160 61
that 0 160 61
