you 0

Booth 0

Before 0
I 0
begin, 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
best 0
leaders 0
are 0
the 0
best 0
followers, 0
and 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Christ 0
(John 0
14:6). 0

With 0
that 0
said, 0
Isn't 0
it 0
funny 0
how 0
things 0
work 0
in 0
this 0
world, 0
it 1
seems 1
like 1
when 1
you 1
do 1
the 1
wrong 1
thing 1
before 1
God 1
and 1
man, 1
somehow 1
people 1
seem 1
to 1
give 1
it 1
a 1
pass. 1

Yet, 1
when 1
you 1
begin 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
right 1
things 1
and 1
obey 1
God 1
and 1
love 1
man 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
Word 1
of 1
God, 1
all 1
of 1
a 1
sudden, 1
the 1
world 1
acts 1
like 1
you're 1
doing 1
something 1
wrong. 1

After 0

my 0

up 0

"What’s 0
wrong 0
with 0
me?" 0

I 0
laughingly 0
replied. 0

I 0
said, 0
"Mom, 0
when 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
the 1
rock 1
n 1
roll 1
world 1
doing 0
the 0
things 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
doing, 0
nobody 0
said 0
anything, 0
and 0
no 0
one 0
had 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
doing, 0
that 0
is 0
until 0
I 0
started 0
to 0
emulate 0
(obey) 0
Jesus 0
Christ" 0
(1 0
John 0
2:6). 0

This 0
reminds 0
me 0
of 0
when 0
I 0
gave 0
a 0
prayer 0
at 0
the 0
state 0
capital 0
in 0
Minnesota. 0

After 0
the 0
prayer 0
was 0
over, 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
minister 0
come 0
up 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
tell 0
me 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
dropping 0
the 0
“J” 0
(Jesus) 0
word 0
in 0
the 0
capital. 0

I 0
said 0
that 0
the 1
reason 1
I 1
dropped 1
the 1
“J” 1
word 1
was 1
because 1
you 1
haven’t 1
in 1
40 1
years 1
(Romans 0
1:16). 0

What 0
of 0
public 0
high 0
schools 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
into 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
educate 0
the 0
youth 0
as 0
to 0
who 0
we 0
are, 0
and 0
not 0
what 0
the 1
revisionists 1
and 1
propagandists 1
would 0
have 0
them 0
believe 0
that 0
we 0
are. 0

We 0
have 0
shown 0
the 0
young 0
people 0
that 0
abortion 1
is 1
murder 1
and 1
that 1
58 1
million 1
babies 1
have 1
been 1
murdered 1
since 1
1973 1
under 1
the 1
guise 1
of 1
woman’s 1
choice 1
(Proverbs 0
6:17). 0

We 1
got 1
kicked 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
public 1
school 1
for 1
re-enforcing 1
America’s 1
value’s 1
by 1
teaching 1
the 1
US 1
Constitution. 1

We 0
have 0
taught 0
that 0
homosexuality 1
is 1
an 1
abomination, 1
and 0
how 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
felony 0
in 0
every 0
state 0
in 0
our 0
union 0
(Leviticus 0
18:22; 0
20:13; 0
Jude 0
1:7). 0

How 0
true 0
Scripture 0
is 0
when 0
it 0
declares: 0

“Woe 0
unto 0
them 0
that 0
call 0
evil 0
good, 0
and 0
good 0
evil; 0
that 0
put 0
darkness 0
for 0
light, 0
and 0
light 0
for 0
darkness; 0
that 0
put 0
bitter 0
for 0
sweet, 0
and 0
sweet 0
for 0
bitter!" 0

No 0
wonder 0
why 0
the 1
reprobates 1
and 1
hypocrites 1
thought 0
that 0
the 0
Christians 0
who 0
were 0
following 0
the 0
living 0
Christ 0
were 0
turning 0
the 0
world 0
upside 0
down 0
in 0
the 0
book 0
of 0
Acts. 0

They 0
were, 0
in 0
fact, 0
turning 0
the 0
world 0
right 0
side 0
up 0
(Acts 0
17:6). 0

Identifying 0
the 0
genuine 0
from 0
the 0
counterfeit 0

Last 0
week, 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
woman 0
come 0
up 0
to 0
me 0
at 0
my 0
last 0
meeting 0
in 0
Amery, 0
Wisconsin. 0

She 0
said 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
her 0
research 0
on 0
me 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
media 0
really 0
attacked 0
me. 0

I 0
responded 0
with, 0
"Of 1
course 1
they 1
did, 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
still 1
do." 1

They 1
are 1
being 1
exposed 1
for 1
who 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
like 1
it. 1

(John 0
15:22). 0

I 0
told 0
her 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
too 0
many 0
counterfeits, 1
self-proclaimed 1
leaders, 1
out 0
there 0
who 1
care 1
more 1
about 1
saving 1
face, 1
than 1
they 1
do 1
the 1
souls 1
of 1
men 1
(Luke 1
19:10), 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
saving 1
their 1
country. 1

Apparently 0
they 0
have 0
a 0
reputation 0
to 0
keep 0
up. 0

Philippians 0
2:7-9 0

These 0
are 0
those 0
that 0
sit 0
behind 0
the 0
status 0
of 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
church 0
or 0
political 1
leader 1
of 1
the 1
pack. 1

Yet, 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
any 1
warfare 1
or 1
opposition 1
around 1
them 1
and 1
why? 1

because 1
they 1
have 1
simply 1
forsaken 1
the 1
cross. 1

There 0
is 0
no 0
absolutes 0
with 0
these 0
people. 0

They 1
are 1
people 1
pleasers 1
and 1
nothing 1
more. 1

After 0
all 0
you 0
can 0
always 0
tell 0
what 0
a 0
man 0
stands 0
for 0
by 0
the 0
enemies 0
that 0
he 0
has. 0

They 0
hide 1
behind 1
a 1
microphone 1
day 0
after 0
day. 0

Yet, 0
they 0
fail 0
to 0
confront 0
the 0
issues 0
that 0
needed 0
to 0
be 0
confronted. 0

The 1
reason 1
they 1
don't 1
is 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
guilty 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
fail 1
to 1
confront! 1

They 0
are 0
paper 1
tigers. 1

They 1
can 1
write 1
all 1
big 1
and 1
bad 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
what 1
someone 1
else 1
should 1
do. 1

However, 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
put 1
boots 1
on 1
the 1
ground, 1
they 1
are 1
simply 1
missing 1
in 1
action 1
(MIA). 1

These 0
are 0
willing 0
to 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
freest 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 0
long 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
them 0
that 0
have 0
to 0
sacrifice 0
to 0
maintain 0
it. 0

There 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
people 0
out 0
there 0
that 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
friends 0
with 0
everyone 0
(and 0
have 0
to 0
apologize 0
to 0
any 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
have 0
told 0
the 0
truth 0
lest 0
they 0
should 0
convict 1
them 1
unto 1
godly 1
repentance 1
(2 0
Corinthians 0
7:10) 0
as 0
they 0
congregate 0
week 0
after 0
week 0
deceiving 1
themselves 1
into 1
believing 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
demanding 1
a 1
lawful 1
change 1
just 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
offend 1
anyone 1
(Matthew 0
5:10). 0

As 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
fact, 0
these 1
counterfeits 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
first 1
ones 1
to 1
get 1
angry 1
with 1
and 1
denounce 1
and 1
attack 1
the 1
ones 1
that 1
are 1
sent 1
by 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
God 1
(Galatians 0
4:29). 0

Maybe 0
this 0
group 0
of 0
people 0
should 0
ask 0
their 0
enemies 0
for 0
instructions 0
as 0
to 0
how 0
change 0
is 0
brought 0
about, 0
and 0
in 1
a 1
righteous 1
sense 1
reverse 1
the 1
lawlessness-taking 1
place 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
(Matthew 0
24:12). 0

These 1
groups 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
simply 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
cross 1
of 1
Christ 1
and 1
know 1
not 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
God 1
unto 1
salvation 1
(Philippians 0
3:18). 0

Furthermore, 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
this 0
woman 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
how 0
you 0
can 0
tell 0
who 0
the 1
genuine 1
Christians 1
are 0
that 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
fight 0
and 0
those 1
who 1
are 1
counterfeits. 1

When 0
the 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
world 0
can 0
jog 1
comfortably 1
along 1
together, 1
you 0
can 0
be 0
sure 0
something 0
is 0
wrong. 0

The 0
world 0
has 0
not 0
compromised—its 0
spirit 0
is 0
exactly 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
it 0
ever 0
was. 0

If 1
Christians 1
were 1
equally 1
as 1
faithful 1
to 1
the 1
Lord, 1
separated 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
(2 1
Corinthians 1
6:17), 1
and 1
living 1
so 1
that 1
their 1
lives 1
were 1
a 1
reproof 1
to 1
all 1
ungodliness, 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
hate 1
them 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
it 1
ever 1
did. 1

(John 0
7:7) 0
It 0
is 0
the 0
church 0
that 0
has 0
compromised, 0
not 0
the 0
world. 0

The 0
way 0
to 0
gauge 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
actually 0
taking 1
ground 1
for 1
the 1
kingdom 1
is 0
to 0
see 0
who 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
a 0
continuous 0
warfare 0
(always 0
in 0
trouble, 0
slandered, 1
lied 1
about, 1
defamed 1
etc) 0
fighting 1
the 1
good 1
fight 1
of 1
faith 1
because 0
they 0
trust 0
in 0
the 0
living 0
God 0
(Matthew 0
11:12; 0
1 0
Timothy 0
6:12). 0

John 0
Calvin 0
said, 0
“Whomsoever 0
the 0
Lord 0
has 0
adopted 0
and 0
deemed 0
worthy 0
of 0
His 0
fellowship 0
ought 0
to 0
prepare 0
themselves 0
for 0
a 0
hard, 1
toilsome 1
and 1
unquiet 1
life, 1
crammed 1
with 1
very 1
many 1
and 1
various 1
kinds 1
of 1
evil.” 1
And 0
of 0
course 0
