perhaps 0 106 6
the 0 106 6
most 0 106 6

was 1 106 7
about 1 106 7

Therefore, 0 106 8
we 0 106 8
earnestly 0 106 8
hope 0 106 8
that 0 106 8
the 0 106 8

abundant 0 106 8
fruits 0 106 8
of 0 106 8

progress 0 106 8

may 0 106 8

a 0 106 8
unity 0 106 8

them 0 106 8

But 0 106 9
in 0 106 9
1983 0 106 9
at 0 106 9
the 0 106 9
start 0 106 9
of 0 106 9
my 0 106 9
personal 0 106 9
investigations 0 106 9
into 0 106 9
the 0 106 9
Catholic 0 106 9
religion, 0 106 9
I 0 106 9
knew 0 106 9
nothing 0 106 9
of 0 106 9
any 0 106 9
of 0 106 9
that. 0 106 9

The 0 106 10
encyclical, 0 106 10
the 0 106 10
very 0 106 10
first 0 106 10
I 0 106 10
ever 0 106 10
read, 0 106 10
was 0 106 10
also 0 106 10
a 0 106 10
marker 0 106 10
for 0 106 10
me 0 106 10
of 0 106 10
a 0 106 10
personal 0 106 10
turning 0 106 10
point. 0 106 10

It 0 106 11
was 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
first 0 106 11
time 0 106 11
I 0 106 11
had 0 106 11
ever 0 106 11
seen 0 106 11
Catholic 0 106 11
eucharistic 0 106 11
doctrine 0 106 11
clearly 0 106 11
and 0 106 11
– 0 106 11
most 0 106 11
importantly 0 106 11
– 0 106 11
unapologetically 0 106 11
stated. 0 106 11

It 0 106 12
came 0 106 12
right 0 106 12
out 0 106 12
and 0 106 12
said 0 106 12
something 0 106 12
so 0 106 12
astounding, 0 106 12
something 0 106 12
so 0 106 12
completely 0 106 12
unlikely, 0 106 12
that 0 106 12
I 0 106 12
had 0 106 12
to 0 106 12
admit 0 106 12
that 0 106 12
it 0 106 12
left 0 106 12
very 0 106 12
few 0 106 12
logical 0 106 12
possibilities. 0 106 12

Like 0 106 13
C.S. 0 106 13

Lewis’s 0 106 14
assessment 0 106 14
of 0 106 14
the 0 106 14
claims 0 106 14
by 0 106 14
Christ 0 106 14
of 0 106 14
His 0 106 14
own 0 106 14
divinity, 0 106 14
this 0 106 14
pope 0 106 14
was 0 106 14
either 0 106 14
mad, 0 106 14
bad 0 106 14
or 0 106 14
telling 0 106 14
the 0 106 14
plain 0 106 14
truth. 0 106 14

Something 0 106 15
that 0 106 15
may 0 106 15
be 0 106 15
much 0 106 15
more 0 106 15
noteworthy 0 106 15
now 0 106 15
in 0 106 15
our 0 106 15
current 0 106 15
circumstances 0 106 15
than 0 106 15
it 0 106 15
was 0 106 15
the 0 106 15
year 0 106 15
I 0 106 15
read 0 106 15
it, 0 106 15
is 0 106 15
that 0 106 15
the 0 106 15
pope’s 0 106 15
very 0 106 15
first 0 106 15
quote 0 106 15
was 0 106 15
not 0 106 15
of 0 106 15
scripture, 0 106 15
but 0 106 15
the 0 106 15
Council 0 106 15
of 0 106 15
Trent: 0 106 15

“At 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
Last 0 106 16
Supper, 0 106 16
on 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
night 0 106 16
He 0 106 16
was 0 106 16
handed 0 106 16
over, 0 106 16
Our 0 106 16
Lord 0 106 16
instituted 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
Eucharistic 0 106 16
Sacrifice 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
His 0 106 16
Body 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
Blood, 0 106 16
to 0 106 16
perpetuate 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
sacrifice 0 106 16

the 0 106 16
cross 0 106 16
throughout 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
ages 0 106 16
until 0 106 16
He 0 106 16
should 0 106 16
come, 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
thus 0 106 16
entrust 0 106 16
to 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
Church, 0 106 16
His 0 106 16
beloved 0 106 16
spouse, 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
memorial 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
His 0 106 16
death 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
resurrection: 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
sacrament 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
devotion, 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
sign 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
unity, 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
bond 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
charity, 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
paschal 0 106 16
banquet 0 106 16
in 0 106 16
which 0 106 16
Christ 0 106 16
is 0 106 16
received, 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
soul 0 106 16
is 0 106 16
filled 0 106 16
with 0 106 16
grace 0 106 16

there 0 106 16
is 0 106 16
given 0 106 16
to 0 106 16
us 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
pledge 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
future 0 106 16
glory.” 0 106 16

In 0 106 17
these 0 106 17
words 0 106 17
are 0 106 17
highlighted 0 106 17
both 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
sacrifice, 0 106 17
which 0 106 17
pertains 0 106 17
to 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
essence 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
Mass 0 106 17
which 0 106 17
is 0 106 17
celebrated 0 106 17
daily, 0 106 17
and 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
sacrament 0 106 17
in 0 106 17
which 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
faithful 0 106 17

Holy 0 106 17
Communion 0 106 17

eating 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
Flesh 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
Christ 0 106 17
and 0 106 17
drinking 0 106 17
His 0 106 17
Blood, 0 106 17
receiving 0 106 17
both 0 106 17
grace, 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
beginning 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
eternal 0 106 17
life, 0 106 17
and 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
medicine 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
immortality. 0 106 17

I 0 106 18
remember 0 106 18
my 0 106 18
thoughts 0 106 18
upon 0 106 18
reading 0 106 18
this 0 106 18
shocking 0 106 18
statement… 0 106 18
“By 0 106 18
doing 0 106 18
what? 0 106 18

!” 0 106 19

My 0 106 20
acceptance 0 106 20
from 0 106 20
the 0 106 20
reading 0 106 20
of 0 106 20
this 0 106 20
document 0 106 20
of 0 106 20
the 0 106 20
Church’s 0 106 20
orthodox 0 106 20
eucharistic 0 106 20
doctrine 0 106 20
was 0 106 20
based 0 106 20
in 0 106 20
part 0 106 20
on 0 106 20
Pope 1 106 20
Paul’s 1 106 20
gracious 1 106 20
and 1 106 20
beautiful 1 106 20
exposition, 1 106 20
and 1 106 20
in 1 106 20
part 1 106 20
on 1 106 20
the 1 106 20
sheer 1 106 20
radical, 1 106 20
mad 1 106 20
unlikeliness 1 106 20
of 1 106 20
it. 1 106 20

What 0 106 21
could 0 106 21
conceivably 0 106 21
be 0 106 21
the 0 106 21
reason 0 106 21
to 0 106 21
say 0 106 21
anything 0 106 21
as 0 106 21
wild 0 106 21
as 0 106 21
this 0 106 21
if 0 106 21
it 0 106 21
weren’t 0 106 21
true? 0 106 21

The 1 106 22
idea 1 106 22
of 1 106 22
transubstantiation 1 106 22
struck 1 106 22
me 1 106 22
as 1 106 22
I 1 106 22
read 1 106 22
that 1 106 22
document 1 106 22
as 1 106 22
possibly 1 106 22
the 1 106 22
strangest 1 106 22
and 1 106 22
most 1 106 22
earth 1 106 22
shattering 1 106 22
thing 1 106 22
I’d 1 106 22
ever 1 106 22
heard. 1 106 22

It 1 106 23
shocked 1 106 23
me 1 106 23
out 1 106 23
of 1 106 23
a 1 106 23
kind 1 106 23
of 1 106 23
swamp 1 106 23
of 1 106 23
intellectual 1 106 23
worldliness; 1 106 23
presenting 1 106 23
the 1 106 23
idea 1 106 23
to 1 106 23
my 1 106 23
thirsty 1 106 23
mind 1 106 23
that 1 106 23
there 1 106 23
could 1 106 23
indeed 1 106 23
be 1 106 23
fantastic 1 106 23
realities 1 106 23
far 1 106 23
more 1 106 23
wonderful 1 106 23
than 1 106 23
the 1 106 23
banal 1 106 23
and 1 106 23
painfully 1 106 23
uninteresting 1 106 23
secularist 1 106 23
worldview 1 106 23
I 1 106 23
had 1 106 23
been 1 106 23
taught 1 106 23
to 1 106 23
accept. 1 106 23

It 1 106 24
was 1 106 24
as 1 106 24
though 1 106 24
someone 1 106 24
had 1 106 24
plausibly 1 106 24
told 1 106 24
me 1 106 24
that, 1 106 24
yes, 1 106 24
there 1 106 24
were 1 106 24
fairies 1 106 24
and 1 106 24
magical 1 106 24
kingdoms 1 106 24
in 1 106 24
real 1 106 24
life, 1 106 24
“just 1 106 24
around 1 106 24
the 1 106 24
corner”. 1 106 24

By 0 106 25
the 0 106 25
time 0 106 25
I 0 106 25
read 0 106 25
it, 0 106 25
I 0 106 25
had 0 106 25
been 0 106 25
through 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
long, 0 106 25
slow 0 106 25
transition 0 106 25
from 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
childhood 0 106 25
devoted 0 106 25
to 0 106 25
Our 0 106 25
Lady 0 106 25
and 0 106 25
confirmed 0 106 25
in 0 106 25
my 0 106 25
belief 0 106 25
in 0 106 25
wonders, 0 106 25
to 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
kind 0 106 25
of 0 106 25
disappointed 0 106 25
practical 0 106 25
atheism 0 106 25
after 0 106 25
three 0 106 25
years 0 106 25
in 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
diocesan 0 106 25
Catholic 0 106 25
parochial 0 106 25
school. 0 106 25

I 0 106 26
had 0 106 26
been 0 106 26
taught, 0 106 26
by 0 106 26
both 0 106 26
word 0 106 26
and 0 106 26
implication, 0 106 26
that 0 106 26
everything 0 106 26
the 0 106 26
Catholic 0 106 26
Church 0 106 26
had 0 106 26
taught 0 106 26
before 0 106 26
Vatican 0 106 26
II 0 106 26
was 0 106 26
pernicious 1 106 26
nonsense. 1 106 26

Where 0 106 27
it 0 106 27
was 0 106 27
simply 0 106 27
wrong 0 106 27
it 0 106 27
was 0 106 27
ridiculous 0 106 27
and 0 106 27
where 0 106 27
it 0 106 27
was 0 106 27
wrong 0 106 27
and 0 106 27
political 0 106 27
it 1 106 27
was 1 106 27
outright 1 106 27
wicked. 1 106 27

What 0 106 28
led 0 106 28
me 0 106 28
to 0 106 28
read 0 106 28
that 0 106 28
particular 0 106 28
encyclical 0 106 28
is 0 106 28
the 0 106 28
most 0 106 28
clearly 0 106 28
identifiable 0 106 28
moment 0 106 28
of 0 106 28
actual 0 106 28
grace 0 106 28
in 0 106 28
my 0 106 28
young 0 106 28
life 0 106 28
to 0 106 28
that 0 106 28
point. 0 106 28

It 0 106 29
was 0 106 29
the 0 106 29
first 0 106 29
time 0 106 29
it 0 106 29
occurred 0 106 29
to 0 106 29
me 0 106 29
to 0 106 29
investigate, 0 106 29
like 0 106 29
an 0 106 29
anthropologist, 0 106 29
what 0 106 29
the 0 106 29
Church 0 106 29
herself 0 106 29
said 0 106 29
about 0 106 29
her 0 106 29
teachings. 0 106 29

While 0 106 30
mulling 0 106 30
grimly 0 106 30
one 0 106 30
day 0 106 30
over 0 106 30
all 0 106 30
the 0 106 30
wickedness 0 106 30
of 0 106 30
the 0 106 30
Catholic 0 106 30
Church, 0 106 30
I 0 106 30
was 0 106 30
pulled 0 106 30
up 0 106 30
short 0 106 30
by 0 106 30
a 0 106 30
single 0 106 30
thought: 0 106 30
“I 0 106 30
could 0 106 30
be 0 106 30
wrong.” 0 106 30
At 0 106 30
17 0 106 30
it 0 106 30
seemed 0 106 30
such 0 106 30
an 0 106 30
unlikely 0 106 30
thing 0 106 30
to 0 106 30
think 0 106 30
I 0 106 30
was 0 106 30
rather 0 106 30
shocked. 0 106 30

But 0 106 31
stopping 0 106 31
a 0 106 31
moment 0 106 31
to 0 106 31
consider, 0 106 31
I 0 106 31
realised 0 106 31
that 0 106 31
I 0 106 31
had 0 106 31
only 0 106 31
ever 0 106 31
heard 0 106 31
about 0 106 31
Catholic 0 106 31
things 0 106 31
from 0 106 31
people 0 106 31
who 0 106 31
clearly 0 106 31
hated 0 106 31
the 0 106 31
Church; 0 106 31
her 0 106 31
enemies, 0 106 31
in 0 106 31
short. 0 106 31

It 0 106 32
hardly 0 106 32
seemed 0 106 32
just 0 106 32
to 0 106 32
convict 0 106 32
on 0 106 32
the 0 106 32
testimony 0 106 32
of 0 106 32
these 0 106 32
obviously 0 106 32
biased 0 106 32
witnesses. 0 106 32

In 0 106 33
order 0 106 33
to 0 106 33
properly 0 106 33
and 0 106 33
thoroughly 0 106 33
condemn 0 106 33
the 0 106 33
Church, 0 106 33
with 0 106 33
convincing 0 106 33
due 0 106 33
diligence, 0 106 33
I 0 106 33
had 0 106 33
to 0 106 33
read 0 106 33
something 0 106 33
about 0 106 33
it 0 106 33
that 0 106 33
didn’t 0 106 33
come 0 106 33
from 0 106 33
her 0 106 33
enemies. 0 106 33

The 0 106 34
same 0 106 34
day, 0 106 34
I 0 106 34
presented 0 106 34
myself 0 106 34
at 0 106 34
the 0 106 34
reference 0 106 34
desk 0 106 34
of 0 106 34
the 0 106 34
public 0 106 34
library 0 106 34
and 0 106 34
asked, 0 106 34
“Do 0 106 34
you 0 106 34
have 0 106 34
any 0 106 34
books 0 106 34
about 0 106 34
Catholicism? 0 106 34

Something 0 106 35
official?” 0 106 35
The 0 106 35
librarian 0 106 35
took 0 106 35
me 0 106 35
to 0 106 35
the 0 106 35
reference 0 106 35
section 0 106 35
and 0 106 35
showed 0 106 35
me 0 106 35
the 0 106 35
shelves 0 106 35
of 0 106 35
encyclicals, 0 106 35
documents 0 106 35
and 0 106 35
histories. 0 106 35

Saints 0 106 36
and 0 106 36
popes 0 106 36
from 0 106 36
one 0 106 36
end 0 106 36
of 0 106 36
the 0 106 36
stacks 0 106 36
to 0 106 36
the 0 106 36
other. 0 106 36

Having 0 106 37
no 0 106 37
clear 0 106 37
idea 0 106 37
what 0 106 37
my 0 106 37
own 0 106 37
question 0 106 37
meant, 0 106 37
I 0 106 37
just 0 106 37
picked 0 106 37
one 0 106 37
at 0 106 37
random. 0 106 37

The 0 106 38
description 0 106 38
of 0 106 38
the 0 106 38
Holy 0 106 38
Eucharist 0 106 38
as 0 106 38
the 0 106 38
supreme 0 106 38
Centre 0 106 38
from 0 106 38
which 0 106 38
all 0 106 38
our 0 106 38
life 0 106 38
as 0 106 38
Catholics 0 106 38
flow, 0 106 38
and 0 106 38
from 0 106 38
which 0 106 38
all 0 106 38
other 0 106 38
doctrines 0 106 38
radiated, 0 106 38
was 0 106 38
something 0 106 38
that 0 106 38
was 0 106 38
not 0 106 38
going 0 106 38
to 0 106 38
come 0 106 38
into 0 106 38
my 0 106 38
head 0 106 38
for 0 106 38
another 0 106 38
eight 0 106 38
years 0 106 38
of 0 106 38
reading. 0 106 38

But 0 106 39
even 0 106 39
so, 0 106 39
Mysterium 0 106 39
Fidei 0 106 39
forced 0 106 39
me 0 106 39
to 0 106 39
face 0 106 39
up 0 106 39
to 0 106 39
a 0 106 39
reality 0 106 39
I’d 0 106 39
never 0 106 39
dreamed 0 106 39
of 0 106 39
before; 0 106 39
that 0 106 39
this, 0 106 39
the 0 106 39
little 0 106 39
unassuming 0 106 39
wafer, 0 106 39
was 0 106 39
the 0 106 39
most 0 106 39
important 0 106 39
thing 0 106 39
in 0 106 39
the 0 106 39
world. 0 106 39

Reading 0 106 40
through 0 106 40
the 0 106 40
encyclical 0 106 40
again, 0 106 40
holding 0 106 40
it 0 106 40
up 0 106 40
next 0 106 40
to 0 106 40
the 0 106 40
current 0 106 40
situation 0 106 40
in 0 106 40
Rome, 0 106 40
makes 0 106 40
it 0 106 40
easier 0 106 40
to 0 106 40
clarify 0 106 40
certain 0 106 40
critical 0 106 40
issues. 0 106 40

Given 0 106 41
what 0 106 41
we 0 106 41
are 0 106 41
now 0 106 41
seeing, 0 106 41
consider 0 106 41
the 0 106 41
poignancy 0 106 41
of 0 106 41
the 0 106 41
following 0 106 41
passages: 0 106 41

When 0 106 42
dealing 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
restoration 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
sacred 0 106 42
liturgy, 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
Fathers 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
council, 0 106 42
by 0 106 42
reason 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
their 0 106 42
pastoral 0 106 42
concern 0 106 42
for 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
whole 0 106 42
Church, 0 106 42
considered 0 106 42
it 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
highest 0 106 42
importance 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
exhort 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
faithful 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
participate 0 106 42
actively 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
sound 0 106 42
faith 0 106 42
and 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
utmost 0 106 42
devotion 0 106 42
in 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
celebration 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
this 0 106 42
Most 0 106 42
Holy 0 106 42
Mystery, 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
offer 0 106 42
it 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
priest 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
God 0 106 42
as 0 106 42
a 0 106 42
sacrifice 0 106 42
for 0 106 42
their 0 106 42
own 0 106 42
salvation 0 106 42
and 0 106 42
for 0 106 42
that 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
whole 0 106 42
world, 0 106 42
and 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
find 0 106 42
in 0 106 42
it 0 106 42
spiritual 0 106 42
nourishment. 0 106 42

This 0 106 43
was, 0 106 43
remember, 0 106 43
1965, 0 106 43
four 0 106 43
years 0 106 43
before 0 106 43
the 0 106 43
New 0 106 43
Mass 0 106 43
was 0 106 43
issued 0 106 43
and 0 106 43
before 0 106 43
Cardinal 0 106 43
Ottaviani 0 106 43
warned 0 106 43
the 0 106 43
pope 0 106 43
that 0 106 43
it 0 106 43
was 0 106 43
precisely 0 106 43
this 1 106 43
sacramental 1 106 43
reality 1 106 43
that 1 106 43
was 1 106 43
about 1 106 43
to 1 106 43
be 1 106 43
catastrophically 1 106 43
obscured. 1 106 43

Who, 0 106 44
reading 0 106 44
this 0 106 44
passage, 0 106 44
does 0 106 44
not 0 106 44
feel 0 106 44
the 0 106 44
urge 0 106 44
to 0 106 44
shout 0 106 44
down 0 106 44
the 0 106 44
years, 0 106 44
to 0 106 44
do 0 106 44
something 0 106 44
to 0 106 44
stave 0 106 44
off 0 106 44
the 0 106 44
disaster 0 106 44
that 0 106 44
was 0 106 44
coming: 0 106 44

[W]e 0 106 45
are 0 106 45
aware 0 106 45
of 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
fact 0 106 45
that, 0 106 45
among 0 106 45
those 0 106 45
who 0 106 45
deal 0 106 45
with 0 106 45
this 0 106 45
Most 0 106 45
Holy 0 106 45
Mystery 0 106 45
in 0 106 45
written 0 106 45
or 0 106 45
spoken 0 106 45
word, 0 106 45
there 0 106 45
are 0 106 45
some 0 106 45
who 0 106 45
with 0 106 45
reference 0 106 45
either 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
Masses 0 106 45
which 0 106 45
are 0 106 45
celebrated 0 106 45
in 0 106 45
private, 0 106 45
or 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
dogma 0 106 45
of 0 106 45
transubstantiation, 0 106 45
or 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
devotion 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
Eucharist, 0 106 45
spread 0 106 45
abroad 0 106 45
opinions 0 106 45
which 0 106 45
disturb 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
faithful 0 106 45
and 0 106 45
fill 0 106 45
their 0 106 45
minds 0 106 45
with 0 106 45
no 0 106 45
little 0 106 45
confusion 0 106 45
about 0 106 45
matters 0 106 45
of 0 106 45
faith. 0 106 45

It 0 106 46
is 0 106 46
as 0 106 46
if 0 106 46
everyone 0 106 46
were 0 106 46
permitted 0 106 46
to 0 106 46

doctrine 0 106 46

the 0 106 46
Church, 0 106 46
or 0 106 46
else 0 106 46
to 0 106 46
interpret 0 106 46
it 0 106 46
in 0 106 46
such 0 106 46
a 0 106 46
way 0 106 46
as 0 106 46
to 0 106 46
weaken 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
genuine 0 106 46
meaning 0 106 46
of 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
words 0 106 46

the 0 106 46
recognized 0 106 46
force 0 106 46
of 0 106 46
the 0 106 46

involved. 0 106 46

Ottaviani’s 0 106 47
Intervention 0 106 47
directly 0 106 47
before 0 106 47
our 0 106 47
thoughts, 0 106 47
we 0 106 47
read 0 106 47
with 0 106 47
a 0 106 47
strange 0 106 47
kind 0 106 47
of 0 106 47
helpless 0 106 47
dread… 0 106 47

…it 1 106 48
is 1 106 48
not 1 106 48
allowable 1 106 48
to 1 106 48
emphasize 1 106 48
what 1 106 48
is 1 106 48
called 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
“communal” 1 106 48
Mass 1 106 48
to 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
disparagement 1 106 48
of 1 106 48
Masses 1 106 48
celebrated 1 106 48
in 1 106 48
private, 1 106 48
or 1 106 48
to 1 106 48
exaggerate 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
element 1 106 48
of 1 106 48
sacramental 1 106 48
sign 1 106 48
as 1 106 48
if 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
symbolism, 1 106 48
which 1 106 48
all 1 106 48
certainly 1 106 48
admit 1 106 48
in 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
Eucharist, 1 106 48
expresses 1 106 48
fully 1 106 48
and 1 106 48
exhausts 1 106 48
completely 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
mode 1 106 48
of 1 106 48
Christ’s 1 106 48
presence 1 106 48
in 1 106 48
this 1 106 48
sacrament. 1 106 48

Nor 1 106 49
is 1 106 49
it 1 106 49
allowable 1 106 49
to 1 106 49
discuss 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
mystery 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
transubstantiation 1 106 49
without 1 106 49
mentioning 1 106 49
what 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
Council 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
Trent 1 106 49
stated 1 106 49
about 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
marvelous 1 106 49
conversion 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
whole 1 106 49
substance 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
bread 1 106 49
into 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
Body 1 106 49
and 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
whole 1 106 49
substance 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
wine 1 106 49
into 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
Blood 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
Christ, 1 106 49
speaking 1 106 49
rather 1 106 49
only 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
what 1 106 49
is 1 106 49
called 1 106 49
“transignification” 1 106 49
and 1 106 49
“transfiguration,” 1 106 49
or 0 106 49
finally 0 106 49
to 0 106 49
propose 0 106 49
and 0 106 49
act 0 106 49
upon 0 106 49
the 0 106 49
opinion 0 106 49
according 0 106 49
to 0 106 49
which, 0 106 49
in 0 106 49
the 0 106 49
Consecrated 0 106 49
Hosts 0 106 49
which 0 106 49
remain 0 106 49
after 0 106 49
the 0 106 49
celebration 0 106 49
of 0 106 49
the 0 106 49
sacrifice 0 106 49
of 0 106 49
the 0 106 49
Mass, 0 106 49
Christ 0 106 49
Our 0 106 49
Lord 0 106 49
is 0 106 49
no 0 106 49
longer 0 106 49
present. 0 106 49

[…] 0 106 50

And 0 106 51
therefore, 0 106 51
so 0 106 51
that 0 106 51
the 0 106 51
hope 0 106 51
aroused 0 106 51
by 0 106 51
the 0 106 51
council, 0 106 51
that 0 106 51
a 0 106 51

of 0 106 51
eucharistic 0 106 51

is 0 106 51
now 0 106 51
pervading 0 106 51
the 0 106 51

Church, 0 106 51
be 0 106 51
not 0 106 51

by 0 106 51
this 0 106 51
spread 0 106 51
of 0 106 51
false 0 106 51

we 0 106 51
have 0 106 51
with 0 106 51
apostolic 0 106 51

you, 0 106 51
venerable 0 106 51

Those 0 106 53
of 0 106 53
us 0 106 53
writing 0 106 53
similar 0 106 53
jeremiads 0 106 53
now 0 106 53
have 0 106 53
been 0 106 53
working 0 106 53
to 0 106 53
clarify 0 106 53
that 0 106 53
the 0 106 53
attack 0 106 53
from 0 106 53
Rome 0 106 53
on 0 106 53
the 0 106 53
moral 0 106 53
doctrine 0 106 53
of 0 106 53
the 0 106 53
Church 0 106 53
isn’t 0 106 53
about 0 106 53
marriage. 0 106 53

It’s 0 106 54
about 0 106 54
the 0 106 54
Eucharist 0 106 54
and 0 106 54
to 0 106 54
a 0 106 54
lesser 0 106 54
extent 0 106 54
the 0 106 54
priesthood. 0 106 54

The 1 106 55
demonic 1 106 55
forces 1 106 55
we 1 106 55
know 1 106 55
are 1 106 55
the 1 106 55
driving 1 106 55
force 1 106 55
behind 1 106 55
this 1 106 55
supreme 1 106 55
moment 1 106 55
of 1 106 55
heresy 1 106 55
and 1 106 55
destruction 1 106 55
aren’t 1 106 55
really 1 106 55
looking 1 106 55
at 1 106 55
the 1 106 55
undermining 1 106 55
of 1 106 55
marriage 1 106 55
as 1 106 55
their 1 106 55
primary 1 106 55
goal; 1 106 55
they 1 106 55
want 1 106 55
to 1 106 55
get 1 106 55
at 1 106 55
the 1 106 55
Eucharist. 1 106 55

We 1 106 56
know 1 106 56
it 1 106 56
is 1 106 56
demonically 1 106 56
inspired 1 106 56
because 1 106 56
their 1 106 56
hatred 1 106 56
is 1 106 56
for 1 106 56
Christ 1 106 56
Himself 1 106 56
in 1 106 56
the 1 106 56
first 1 106 56
place 1 106 56
and 1 106 56
for 1 106 56
anyone 1 106 56
who 1 106 56
loves 1 106 56
and 1 106 56
wants 1 106 56
to 1 106 56
serve 1 106 56
Him 1 106 56
second. 1 106 56

They 1 106 57
are 1 106 57
men 1 106 57
who 1 106 57
refuse 1 106 57
to 1 106 57
bend 1 106 57
the 1 106 57
knee 1 106 57
before 1 106 57
the 1 106 57
God 1 106 57
whom 1 106 57
they 1 106 57
will 1 106 57
not 1 106 57
serve. 1 106 57

This 0 106 58
knowledge 0 106 58
– 0 106 58
that 0 106 58
the 0 106 58
attack 0 106 58
is 0 106 58
on 0 106 58
the 0 106 58
Body 0 106 58
and 0 106 58
Blood 0 106 58
of 0 106 58
Christ 0 106 58
– 0 106 58
can 0 106 58
also 0 106 58
help 0 106 58
readers 0 106 58
spot 0 106 58
their 0 106 58
friends 0 106 58
in 0 106 58
the 0 106 58
crowd. 0 106 58

The 0 106 59
places 0 106 59
where 0 106 59
Eucharistic 0 106 59
adoration 0 106 59
is 0 106 59
still 0 106 59
offered 0 106 59
are 0 106 59
places 0 106 59
where 0 106 59
at 0 106 59
least 0 106 59
some 0 106 59
flicker 0 106 59
of 0 106 59
the 0 106 59
true 0 106 59
Faith 0 106 59
survives. 0 106 59

The 0 106 60
bishops 0 106 60
and 0 106 60
priests 0 106 60
now 0 106 60
talking 0 106 60
about 0 106 60
the 0 106 60
supreme 0 106 60
glory 0 106 60
of 0 106 60
the 0 106 60
Eucharist, 0 106 60
and 0 106 60
the 0 106 60
need 0 106 60
to 0 106 60
defend 0 106 60
it 0 106 60
from 0 106 60
sacrilege, 0 106 60
are 0 106 60
lighthouses. 0 106 60

A 0 106 61
case 0 106 61
in 0 106 61
point 0 106 61
is 0 106 61
Bishop 0 106 61
Mark 0 106 61
Davies, 0 106 61
of 0 106 61
my 0 106 61
own 0 106 61
former 0 106 61
diocese 0 106 61
of 0 106 61
Shrewsbury 0 106 61
in 0 106 61
England. 0 106 61

In 0 106 62
March, 0 106 62
2016, 0 106 62
in 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
midst 0 106 62
of 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
shouting 0 106 62
from 0 106 62
Rome, 0 106 62
Bishop 0 106 62
Davies 0 106 62
spoke 0 106 62
at 0 106 62
his 0 106 62
Chrism 0 106 62
Mass 0 106 62
said 0 106 62
that 0 106 62
only 0 106 62
through 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
“reality 0 106 62
of 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
Eucharist” 0 106 62
could 0 106 62
new 0 106 62
vocations 0 106 62
to 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
priesthood 0 106 62
be 0 106 62
found. 0 106 62

“In 0 106 63
treasuring 0 106 63
this 0 106 63
gift 0 106 63
of 0 106 63
priestly 0 106 63
celibacy 0 106 63
we 0 106 63
need 0 106 63
to 0 106 63
recognize 0 106 63
more 0 106 63
clearly 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
intimate 0 106 63
link 0 106 63
between 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
Ministerial 0 106 63
Priesthood 0 106 63
and 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
reality 0 106 63
of 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
Eucharist. 0 106 63

If 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
Mass 1 106 64
were 1 106 64
ever 1 106 64
reduced 1 106 64
in 1 106 64
our 1 106 64
minds 1 106 64
to 1 106 64
being 1 106 64
merely 1 106 64
a 1 106 64
commemorative 1 106 64
meal 1 106 64
and 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
priest 1 106 64
as 1 106 64
only 1 106 64
a 1 106 64
community 1 106 64
leader 1 106 64
or 1 106 64
functionary, 1 106 64
then 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
celibacy 1 106 64
of 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
Catholic 1 106 64
Priesthood 1 106 64
might 1 106 64
seem 1 106 64
extravagant.” 1 106 64

It’s 0 106 65
almost 0 106 65
as 0 106 65
if 0 106 65
someone 0 106 65
had 0 106 65
slipped 0 106 65
a 0 106 65
copy 0 106 65
of 0 106 65
the 0 106 65
Ottaviani 0 106 65
Intervention 0 106 65
inside 0 106 65
his 0 106 65
morning 0 106 65
paper. 0 106 65

The 0 106 66
targeting 0 106 66
of 0 106 66
marriage, 0 106 66
through 0 106 66
the 0 106 66
instruments 0 106 66
of 0 106 66
creatures 0 106 66
like 0 106 66
the 0 106 66
myopic 0 106 66
and 0 106 66
theologically 0 106 66
tunnel-visioned 0 106 66
Cardinal 0 106 66
Kasper, 0 106 66
is 1 106 66
demonically 1 106 66
brilliant. 1 106 66

It’s 0 106 67
a 0 106 67
“stitch-up” 0 106 67
as 0 106 67
the 0 106 67
English 0 106 67
call 0 106 67
it; 0 106 67
a 0 106 67
fix. 0 106 67

You 0 106 68
make 0 106 68
it 0 106 68
a 0 106 68
matter 0 106 68
of 0 106 68
“mercy” 0 106 68
(backed 0 106 68
up 0 106 68
by 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
iron 0 106 68
fist) 0 106 68
that 0 106 68
no 0 106 68
one 0 106 68
in 0 106 68
a 0 106 68
state 0 106 68
of 0 106 68
objective 0 106 68
mortal 0 106 68
sin 0 106 68
can 0 106 68
be 0 106 68
refused 0 106 68
Holy 0 106 68
Communion; 0 106 68
you 0 106 68
give 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
national 0 106 68
bishops 0 106 68
conferences 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
power 0 106 68
to 0 106 68
start 0 106 68
enforcing 0 106 68
this, 0 106 68
and 0 106 68
you 0 106 68
have 0 106 68
created 0 106 68
a 0 106 68
previously 0 106 68
unimaginable 0 106 68
situation 0 106 68
in 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
Church. 0 106 68

You 0 106 69
have 0 106 69
created 0 106 69
a 0 106 69
regime 0 106 69
in 0 106 69
which 0 106 69
a 0 106 69
refusal 0 106 69
to 0 106 69
desecrate 0 106 69
the 0 106 69
sacred 0 106 69
species 0 106 69
will 0 106 69
be 0 106 69
grounds 0 106 69
for 0 106 69
persecution 0 106 69
of 0 106 69
faithful 0 106 69
priests, 0 106 69
seminarians 0 106 69
and 0 106 69
laity. 0 106 69

And 0 106 70
of 0 106 70
course, 0 106 70
we 0 106 70
are 0 106 70
seeing 0 106 70
it 0 106 70
starting 0 106 70
already. 0 106 70

It’s 0 106 71
a 0 106 71
brilliant 0 106 71
strategy, 0 106 71
the 0 106 71
magic 0 106 71
bullet 0 106 71
that 0 106 71
will 0 106 71
revert 0 106 71
the 0 106 71
Church 0 106 71
to 0 106 71
the 0 106 71
1976 0 106 71
model 0 106 71
on 0 106 71
every 0 106 71
front, 0 106 71
and 0 106 71
very 0 106 71
likely 0 106 71
keep 0 106 71
it 0 106 71
there 0 106 71
forever. 0 106 71

As 0 106 72
if 0 106 72
the 0 106 72
goal 0 106 72
was 0 106 72
to 0 106 72
go 0 106 72
back 0 106 72
in 0 106 72
time 0 106 72
and 0 106 72
erase 0 106 72

entire 0 106 72
John 0 106 72
Paul 0 106 72
II/Benedict 0 106 72
XVI 0 106 72
period 0 106 72
out 0 106 72
of 0 106 72
history. 0 106 72

It 0 106 73
will 0 106 73
halt 0 106 73
the 0 106 73
revival 0 106 73
of 0 106 73
eucharistic 0 106 73
piety 0 106 73
among 0 106 73
seminarians; 0 106 73
in 0 106 73
fact, 0 106 73
it 0 106 73
will 0 106 73
reverse 0 106 73
the 0 106 73
general 0 106 73
reforming 0 106 73
trend 0 106 73
of 0 106 73
“conservative” 0 106 73
seminaries 0 106 73
that 0 106 73
was 0 106 73
such 0 106 73
a 0 106 73
feature 0 106 73
under 0 106 73
John 0 106 73
Paul 0 106 73
II 0 106 73
and 0 106 73
has 0 106 73
for 0 106 73
30 0 106 73
years 0 106 73
been 0 106 73
the 0 106 73
hook 0 106 73
upon 0 106 73
which 0 106 73
all 0 106 73
hopes 0 106 73
of 0 106 73
restoration 0 106 73
have 0 106 73
hung. 0 106 73

It 0 106 74
is 0 106 74
easy 0 106 74
to 0 106 74
see 0 106 74
what 0 106 74
is 0 106 74
coming 0 106 74
next. 0 106 74

Once 0 106 75
certain 0 106 75
announcements 0 106 75
are 0 106 75
published 0 106 75
in 0 106 75
parish 0 106 75
bulletins, 0 106 75
laity 0 106 75
will 0 106 75
have 0 106 75
to 0 106 75
consider 0 106 75
whether 0 106 75
they 0 106 75
can, 0 106 75
in 0 106 75
conscience, 0 106 75
continue 0 106 75
to 0 106 75
assist 0 106 75
at 0 106 75
Masses 0 106 75
where 0 106 75
systematic 0 106 75
sacrilege 0 106 75
has 0 106 75
been 0 106 75
formally 0 106 75
adopted 0 106 75
as 0 106 75
the 0 106 75
rule. 0 106 75

The 0 106 76
few 0 106 76
bishops 0 106 76
with 0 106 76
sufficient 0 106 76
spine 0 106 76
to 0 106 76
stand 0 106 76
up 0 106 76
to 0 106 76
the 0 106 76
pressure 0 106 76
of 0 106 76
both 0 106 76
Rome 0 106 76
and 0 106 76
their 0 106 76
own 0 106 76
national 0 106 76
conferences 0 106 76
– 0 106 76
newly 0 106 76
empowered 0 106 76
with 0 106 76
directives 0 106 76
to 0 106 76
make 0 106 76
doctrinal 0 106 76
declarations 0 106 76
– 0 106 76
will 1 106 76
be 1 106 76
ruling 1 106 76
embattled 1 106 76
islands 1 106 76
of 1 106 76
Catholicism 1 106 76
in 1 106 76
a 1 106 76
poisoned 1 106 76
sea 1 106 76
of 1 106 76
systematic 1 106 76
heresy 1 106 76
and 1 106 76
desecration. 1 106 76

A 1 106 77
dark, 1 106 77
impenetrable 1 106 77
and 1 106 77
“irreversible” 1 106 77
winter 1 106 77
of 1 106 77
persecution 1 106 77
of 1 106 77
the 1 106 77
faithful 1 106 77
by 1 106 77
their 1 106 77
own 1 106 77
shepherds 1 106 77
will 1 106 77
fall. 1 106 77

Not 0 106 78
being 0 106 78
a 0 106 78
theologian 0 106 78
I 0 106 78
have 0 106 78
no 0 106 78
idea 0 106 78
if 0 106 78
this 0 106 78
encyclical 0 106 78
is, 0 106 78
as 0 106 78
so 0 106 78
many 0 106 78
of 0 106 78
these 0 106 78
seemingly 0 106 78
orthodox 0 106 78
documents 0 106 78
of 0 106 78
that 0 106 78
period 0 106 78
seem 0 106 78
to 0 106 78
be, 0 106 78
rife 0 106 78
with 0 106 78
the 0 106 78
usual 0 106 78
“time 0 106 78
bombs,” 0 106 78
ambiguities, 0 106 78
mushy 0 106 78
language 0 106 78
or 0 106 78
even 0 106 78
outright 0 106 78
errors. 0 106 78

I 0 106 79
haven’t 0 106 79
looked 0 106 79
it 0 106 79
up. 0 106 79

I’m 0 106 80
sure 0 106 80
there 0 106 80
are 0 106 80
plenty 0 106 80
of 0 106 80
people 0 106 80
out 0 106 80
there 0 106 80
qualified 0 106 80
to 0 106 80
examine 0 106 80
it 0 106 80
to 0 106 80
see 0 106 80
if 0 106 80
it’s 0 106 80
safe 0 106 80
for 0 106 80
Trad-Catholic 0 106 80
consumption. 0 106 80

And 0 106 81
I 0 106 81
have 0 106 81
no 0 106 81
doubt 0 106 81
at 0 106 81
all 0 106 81
that 0 106 81
there 0 106 81
are 0 106 81
better, 0 106 81
more 0 106 81
venerable, 0 106 81
even 0 106 81
more 0 106 81
sublime 0 106 81
and 0 106 81
poignant 0 106 81
works 0 106 81
on 0 106 81
the 0 106 81
Eucharist 0 106 81
in 0 106 81
the 0 106 81
canon 0 106 81
of 0 106 81
“official” 0 106 81
things. 0 106 81

From 0 106 82
saints 0 106 82
and 0 106 82
Doctors 0 106 82
of 0 106 82
the 0 106 82
Church 0 106 82
and 0 106 82
whatnot, 0 106 82
many 0 106 82
of 0 106 82
which 0 106 82
the 0 106 82
pope 0 106 82
cited. 0 106 82

But 1 106 83
whatever 1 106 83
its 1 106 83
flaws, 1 106 83
Mysterium 1 106 83
Fidei 1 106 83
is 1 106 83
the 1 106 83
one 1 106 83
I 1 106 83
found, 1 106 83
and 1 106 83
I’m 1 106 83
convinced 1 106 83
it 1 106 83
wasn’t 1 106 83
an 1 106 83
accident. 1 106 83

O 0 106 84
God, 0 106 84
in 0 106 84
Your 0 106 84
infinite 0 106 84
mercy, 0 106 84
forgive 0 106 84
and 0 106 84
have 0 106 84
mercy 0 106 84
on 0 106 84
Pope 0 106 84
Paul 0 106 84
VI 0 106 84
Montini 0 106 84
for 0 106 84
whatever 0 106 84
neglect 0 106 84
or 0 106 84
damage 0 106 84
of 0 106 84
which 0 106 84
he 0 106 84
may 0 106 84
have 0 106 84
been 0 106 84
guilty. 0 106 84

In 0 106 85
this 0 106 85
one 0 106 85
case 0 106 85
at 0 106 85
least, 0 106 85
a 0 106 85
work 0 106 85
of 0 106 85
his 0 106 85
was 0 106 85
the 0 106 85
exact 0 106 85
right 0 106 85
thing 0 106 85
at 0 106 85
the 0 106 85
exact 0 106 85
right 0 106 85
time. 0 106 85

For 0 106 86
me 0 106 86
at 0 106 86
least 0 106 86
it 0 106 86
was 0 106 86
the 0 106 86
key 0 106 86
that 0 106 86
opened 0 106 86
the 0 106 86
Door 0 106 86
to 0 106 86
Narnia. 0 106 86

The 0 106 88
fact 0 106 88
that 0 106 88
four 0 106 88
years 0 106 88
before 0 106 88
the 0 106 88
New 0 106 88
Mass 0 106 88
was 0 106 88
issued, 0 106 88
Paul 0 106 88
VI 0 106 88
was 0 106 88
pinpointing 0 106 88
in 0 106 88
such 0 106 88
detail 0 106 88
exactly 0 106 88
what 0 106 88
Bugnini 0 106 88
and 0 106 88
co. 0 106 88
were 0 106 88
preparing 0 106 88
makes 0 106 88
it 0 106 88
all 0 106 88
but 0 106 88
impossible 0 106 88
to 0 106 88
escape 0 106 88
the 0 106 88
conclusion 0 106 88
that 0 106 88
he 0 106 88
knew 0 106 88
perfectly 0 106 88
well 0 106 88
what 0 106 88
was 0 106 88
coming 0 106 88
but 0 106 88
approved 0 106 88
the 0 106 88
disastrous 0 106 88
New 0 106 88
Rite 0 106 88
anyway. 0 106 88

And 0 106 89
then 0 106 89
did 0 106 89
nothing 0 106 89
but 0 106 89
weep 0 106 89
as 0 106 89
the 0 106 89
inevitable 0 106 89
disaster 0 106 89
unfolded. 0 106 89
