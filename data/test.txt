that 0
an 0

that 0
was 0
involved 0

The 0
Hill's 0
John 0
Solomon 0
reported 0
on 0
Wednesday: 0

The 0
informant, 0
Douglas 0
Campbell, 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
statement 0
obtained 0
by 0
The 0
Hill 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
told 0
by 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
executives 0
that 0
Moscow 0
had 0
hired 0
the 0
American 0
lobbying 0
firm 0
APCO 0
Worldwide 0
specifically 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
in 0
position 0
to 0
influence 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration, 0
and 0
more 0
specifically 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

... 0
Campbell 0
added 0
in 0
the 0
testimony 0
that 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
officials 0
“told 0
me 0
at 0
various 0
times 0
that 0
they 0
expected 0
APCO 0
to 0
apply 0
a 0
portion 0
of 0
the 0
$3 0
million 0
annual 0
lobbying 0
fee 0
it 0
was 0
receiving 0
from 0
the 0
Russians 0
to 0
provide 0
in-kind 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
Clintons' 0
Global 0
Initiative." 0

“The 0

called 0
for 0
four 0
payments 0
of 0
$750,000 0
over 0
twelve 0
months. 0

was 0
expected 0
to 0
give 0
assistance 0
free 0
of 0
charge 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
effort 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
favorable 0
environment 0
to 0
ensure 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
made 0
affirmative 0
decisions 0
on 0
everything 0
from 0
Uranium 0
One 0
to 0
the 0
U.S.-Russia 0
Civilian 0
Nuclear 0
Cooperation 0
agreement." 0

APCO 0
officials 0
told 0
The 0
Hill 0
that 0
its 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative 0
and 0
its 0
work 0
with 0
Russia 0
were 0
not 0
connected 0
in 0
any 0
way, 0
and 0
in 0
fact 0
involved 0
different 0
divisions 0
of 0
the 0
firm. 0

They 0
added 0
their 0
lobbying 0
for 0
Russia 0
did 0
not 0
involve 0
Uranium 0
One 0
but 0
rather 0
focused 0
on 0
regulatory 0
issues 0
aimed 0
at 0
helping 0
Russia 0
better 0
compete 0
for 0
nuclear 0
fuel 0
contracts 0
inside 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

In 0
case 0
you 0
are 0
unfamiliar 0
with 0
Uranium 0
One, 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
Canadian 0
mining 0
company 0
whose 0
sale 0
to 0
a 0
Russian 0
firm 0
was 0
approved 0
in 0
2010. 0

The 0
sale 0
gave 0
the 0
Russians 0
control 0
of 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
uranium 0
supply, 0
thus 0
why 0
I 0
reference 0
a 0
case 0
could 0
be 0
made 0
for 0
treason. 0

While 0
Democrats 0
have 0
unsurprisingly 0
questioned 0
Campbell's 0
credibility, 0
Campbell's 0
attorney 0
Victoria 0
Toensing 0
told 0
Sean 0
Hannity, 0
“[The 0
Russians] 0
were 0
so 0
confident 0
that 0
they 0
told 0
Mr. 0
Campbell 0
with 0
the 0
Clinton’s 0
help, 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
shoo-in 0
to 0
get 0
CFIUS 0
[The 0
Committee 0
on 0
Foreign 0
Investment 0
in 0

United 0

approval. 0

They 0
were 0
so 0
confident 0
in 0
that 0
that 0
they 0
even 0
had 0
him 0
open 0
up 0
the 0
new 0

because 0
they 0

were 0

In 0
a 0
lengthy 0
report 0
by 0
Award-winning 0
National 0
Security/War 0
Correspondent 0
Sara 0
Carter, 0
she 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
following: 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
he 0
shared 0
with 0
the 0
committee 0
information 0
he 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
described 0
his 0
frustration 0
with 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
failure 0
to 0
stop 0
Russia’s 0
nuclear 0
giant 0
from 0
purchasing 0
20 0
percent 0
of 0
American 0
uranium 0
mining 0
assets. 0

Campbell 0
testified 0
before 0
numerous 0
Congressional 0
investigators 0
that 0
his 0
extensive 0
counterintelligence 0
work 0
on 0
Russia 0
and 0
stated 0
that 0
during 0
his 0
time 0
as 0
an 0
informant, 0
he 0
obtained 0
information 0
that 0
Russia 0
was 0
continuing 0
to 0
aid 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government. 0

According 0
to 0
Campbell 0
Russia 0
provided 0
the 0
resources 0
necessary 0
for 0
the 0
nation’s 0
nuclear 0
reactors, 0
despite 0
promises 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
sharing 0
such 0
technology 0
with 0
Iran. 0

In 0
an 0
April 0
16, 0
2010, 0
summary 0
brief 0
provided 0
to 0
his 0
former 0
FBI 0
handlers 0
and 0
obtained 0
by 0
this 0
reporter, 0
he 0
stressed 0
his 0
deep 0
concerns 0
about 0
Tenex, 0
a 0
wholly 0
owned 0
subsidiary 0
of 0
the 0
Russian 0
state 0
nuclear 0
arm 0
Rosatom 0
and 0
its 0
ongoing 0
work 0
to 0
provide 0
Iran 0
with 0
the 0
technology 0
needed 0
for 0
its 0
nuclear 0
reactor 0
program. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Rosatom 0
was 0
seeking 0
the 0
approval 0
to 0
purchase 0
the 0
Canadian 0
mining 0
company 0
Uranium 0
One. 0

“TENEX 0
continues 0
to 0
supply 0
Iran 0
with 0
fuel 0
through 0
their 0
Russian 0
company 0
TVEL,” 0
stated 0
Campbell 0
in 0
a 0
2010 0
brief 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

TVEL 0
is 0
a 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
fuel 0
cycle 0
company 0
headquartered 0
in 0
Moscow. 0

“They 0
(TVEL) 0
continue 0
to 0
assist 0
with 0
construction 0
consult 0
and 0
fabricated 0
assemblies 0
to 0
supply 0
the 0
reactor. 0

Fabricated 0
assemblies 0
require 0
sophisticated 0
engineering 0
and 0
are 0
arranged 0
inside 0
the 0
reactor 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
and 0
consult 0
of 0
TVEL.” 0
Campbell 0
informed 0
the 0
FBI 0
of 0
the 0
close 0
relationship 0
between 0
TVEL 0
and 0
TENEX, 0
both 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Rosatom 0
group. 0

He 0
stated 0
in 0
his 0
brief 0
that 0
while 0
spending 0
time 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 0
executives 0
from 0
both 0
Rosatom 0
and 0
Tenex, 0
that 0
any 0
mention 0
of 0
“TVEL 0
is 0
a 0
subject 0
that 0
is 0
serious 0
to 0
all 0
when 0
mentioned. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
even 0
raise 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
TVEL 0
to 0
our 0
friends, 0
but 0
occasionally 0
they 0
speak 0
of 0
it 0
and 0
always 0
in 0
a 0
guarded 0
manner.” 0
In 0
the 0
briefs, 0
he 0
informed 0
the 0
FBI 0
that 0
“occasionally 0
someone 0
will 0
mention 0
having 0
been 0
in 0
Iran 0
but 0
usually 0
it 0
is 0
long 0
after 0
the 0
fact.” 0
And 0
when 0
he 0
asked 0
the 0
Russians 0
about 0
these 0
connections, 0
he 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
“occasionally 0
speak 0
of 0
the 0
relationship, 0
i.e. 0

equipment, 0
consulting. 0

I 0
asked 0
Vadim 0
(Mikerin) 0
if 0
they 0
felt 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
serious 0
problem, 0
and 0
would 0
they 0
adhere 0
to 0
sanctions 0
and 0
western 0
opinion. 0

His 0
response 0
was 0
a 0
smile 0
and 0
shoulder 0
shrug.” 0
But 0
Campbell 0
had 0
provided 0
the 0
FBI 0
with 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
network 0
and 0
delivered 0
the 0
information 0
to 0
the 0
FBI, 0
which 0
was 0
monitoring 0
his 0
work 0
as 0
an 0
informant 0
and 0
approving 0
his 0
transfer 0
of 0
bribery 0
money 0
to 0
the 0
Russians. 0

Those 0
transfers, 0
which 0
were 0
made 0
in 0
bulk 0
$50,000 0
sums 0
and 0
at 0
times 0
delivered 0
in 0
cash, 0
occurred 0
between 0
senior 0
executives 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
transportation 0
company 0
and 0
the 0
Russian 0
executives 0
connected 0
to 0
Rosatom. 0

He 0
had 0
given 0
the 0
FBI 0
irrefutable 0
evidence 0
showing 0
how 0
contracts 0
obtained 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
Russian 0
energy 0
company 0
Tenex, 0
were 0
based 0
on 0
contract 0
bribery 0
and 0
other 0
nefarious 0
actions, 0
he 0
said. 0

Senior 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
FBI, 0
Department 0
of 0
Treasury, 0
Department 0
of 0
Energy 0
and 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
were 0
also 0
briefed 0
on 0
Campbell’s 0
information 0
and 0
were 0
apprised 0
of 0
the 0
various 0
facets 0
pertaining 0
to 0
Russia’s 0
acquisition 0
of 0
the 0
Canadian 0
company. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Campbell 0
had 0
been 0
told 0
by 0
his 0
FBI 0
handlers 0
that 0
his 0
work 0
had 0
made 0
it 0
at 0
least 0
twice 0
into 0
President 0
Obama’s 0
classified 0
presidential 0
daily 0
briefings. 0

Of 1
course, 1
we 1
know 1
what 1
Obama 1
did 1
with 1
his 1
daily 1
briefings. 1

They 1
are 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
White 1
House 1
sewer 1
system. 1

Campbell's 0
work 0
has 0
resulted 0
in 0
real 0
justice 0
being 0
administered. 0

In 0
January, 0
I 0
reported: 0

On 0
Friday, 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
unsealed 0
an 0
11-count 0
indictment 0
concerning 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
scandal. 0

Sadly, 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
include 0
former 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
but 0
rather 0
former 0
DoD 0
intelligence 0
analyst-turned 0
uranium 0
transportation 0
executive 0
Mark 0
Lambert 0
of 0
Mount 0
Airy, 0
Maryland. 0

Lambert, 0
54, 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
violate 0
the 0
Foreign 0
Corrupt 0
Practices 0
Act 0
(FCPA) 0
and 0
to 0
commit 0
wire 0
fraud, 0
seven 0
counts 0
of 0
violating 0
the 0
FCPA, 0
two 0
counts 0
of 0
wire 0
fraud 0
and 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
international 0
promotion 0
money 0
laundering. 0

The 0
charges 0
stem 0
from 0
an 0
alleged 0
scheme 0
to 0
bribe 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin, 0
a 0
Russian 0
official 0
at 0
JSC 0
Techsnabexport 0
(TENEX), 0
a 0
subsidiary 0
of 0
Russia’s 0
State 0

Federation 0
uranium 0
and 0
uranium 0
enrichment 0
services 0
to 0
nuclear 0
power 0
companies 0
worldwide, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
contracts 0
with 0
TENEX. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
DOJ: 0
According 0
to 0
the 0
indictment, 0
beginning 0
at 0
least 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
2009 0
and 0
continuing 0
until 0
October 0
2014, 0
Lambert 0
conspired 0
with 0
others 0
at 0
“Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A” 0
to 0
make 0
corrupt 0
and 0
fraudulent 0
bribery 0
and 0
kickback 0
payments 0
to 0
offshore 0
bank 0
accounts 0
associated 0
with 0

companies, 0
at 0
the 0
direction 0
of, 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
benefit 0
of, 0
a 0
Russian 0
official, 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
improper 0
business 0
advantages 0
and 0
obtain 0
and 0
retain 0
business 0
with 0
TENEX. 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
effectuate 0
and 0
conceal 0
the 0
corrupt 0
and 0
fraudulent 0
bribe 0
payments, 0
Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
allegedly 0
caused 0
fake 0
invoices 0
to 0
be 0
prepared, 0
purportedly 1
from 0
TENEX 0
to 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A, 0
that 0
described 0
services 0
that 0
were 0
never 0
provided, 0
and 0
then 0
Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
caused 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A 0
to 0
wire 0
the 0
corrupt 0
payments 0
for 0
those 0
purported 0
services 0
to 0
shell 0
companies 0
in 0
Latvia, 0
Cyprus 0
and 0
Switzerland. 0

Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
also 0
allegedly 0
used 0
code 0
words 0
like 0
“lucky 0
figures,” 0
“LF,” 0
“lucky 0
numbers,” 0
and 0
“cake” 0
to 0
describe 0
the 0
payments 0
in 0
emails 0
to 0
the 0
Russian 0
official 0
at 0
his 0
personal 0
email 0
account. 0

The 0
indictment 0
also 0
alleges 0
that 0
Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
caused 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A 0
to 0
overbill 0
TENEX 0
by 0
building 0
the 0
cost 0
of 0
the 0
corrupt 0
payments 0
into 0
their 0
invoices, 0
and 0
TENEX 0
thus 0
overpaid 0
for 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A’s 0
services. 0

In 0
June 0
2015, 0
Lambert’s 0
former 0
co-president, 0
Daren 0
Condrey, 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
violate 0
the 0
FCPA 0
and 0
commit 0
wire 0
fraud, 0
and 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
commit 0
money 0

involving 0
violations 0
of 0

Mikerin 0
is 0
currently 0

a 0
sentence 0
of 0
48 0
months 0
in 0
prison 0
and 0
Condrey 0
is 0
awaiting 0

The 0
indictment 0
includes 0
allegations 0
against 0
Lambert 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
role 0
in 0
effectuating 0
the 0
criminal 0
scheme 0
with 0
Condrey, 0
Mikerin, 0

We 0
also 0

about 0
Campbell: 0

Undercover 0
FBI 0
informant 0
William 0
Campbell 0
has 0
given 0

to 0
Congressional 0
investigators 0
after 0
an 0
"iron 0

was 0

in 0

Campbell 0
was 0

we 0

out 0
with 0

how 0

across 0

The 0

is 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
an 0
18-month 0
probe, 0
led 0
by 0
state 0
Attorney 0

that 0

Some 0

might 0
reveal 0
the 0
300 0

listed 0
have 0
been 0
redacted 0
from 0
the 0
report. 0

Legal 0
challenges 0
by 0

delayed 0
the 0

release, 0
after 0
some 0
said 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
their 0
constitutional 0
rights. 0

Pennsylvania’s 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
ruled 0
last 0
month 0
that 0
the 0
report 0
must 0
be 0
released 0
but 0
with 0
some 0
redaction. 0

The 0

report’s 0
release 0
begins 0
an 1
information 1
war, 1
with 0
prosecutors 0
and 0
many 0
victims 0
saying 0
it’s 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
holding 0
church 0
leaders 0
at 0
the 0
top 0
accountable 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time, 0
while 0
church 0
lawyers 0
and 0
other 0
advocates 0
for 0
the 0
institution 0
say 0
the 0
report 0
depicts 0
an 0
era 0
of 0
another 0
century, 0
unfairly 1
smearing 1
today’s 0
Catholicism 0
in 0
Pennsylvania. 0

The 0

report 0
has 0
helped 0
renew 0
a 0
crisis 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
thought 0
and 0
hoped 0
had 0
ended 0
nearly 0
20 0
years 0
ago 0
after 1
the 1
scandal 1
erupted 1
in 0
Boston. 0

But 1
recent 1
abuse-related 1
scandals, 1
from 1
Chile 1
to 1
Australia, 1
have 1
reopened 1
wounding 1
questions 1
about 1
accountability 1
and 1
whether 1
church 1
officials 1
are 1
still 1
covering 1
up 1
crimes 1
at 1
the 1
highest 1
levels. 1

The 1

new 1
wave 1
of 1
allegations 1
has 1
called 1
Pope 1
Francis’s 1
handling 1
of 1
abuse 1
into 1
question 1
as 1
many 1
Catholics 1
look 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
church 1
regain 1
its 1
credibility. 1

The 1
pope’s 1
track 1
record 1
has 1
been 1
mixed, 1
something 1
some 1
outsiders 1
attribute 1
to 1
his 1
learning 1
curve 1
or 1
shortcomings 1
and 0
others 0
chalk 0
up 0
to 0
resistance 0
from 0
a 1
notoriously 1
change-averse 1
institution. 1

The 0

Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
follows 0
the 0
resignation 0
last 0
month 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
a 1
towering 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
church 1
and 0
former 0
D.C. 0
archbishop 0
who 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
sexually 0
abusing 0
minors 0
and 0
adults 0
for 0
decades. 0

Both 0
have 0
further 0
polarized 0
the 0
church 0
on 0
homosexuality, 0
celibacy 0
and 0
whether 0
laypeople 0
should 0
have 0
more 0
power. 0

It 0
has 0
also 0
triggered 0
debate 0
about 0
whether 0
statutes 0
of 0
limitations 0
should 0
be 0
expanded. 0

“We’re 0

dealing 0
with 0
a 0
long-term 0
struggle 0
not 0
only 0
about 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
justice, 0
but 0
about 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
memory,” 0
said 0
Jason 0
Berry, 0
a 0
reporter 0
and 0
author 0
who 0
has 0
covered 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
for 0
decades. 0

“And 1
how 1
honest 1
the 1
church 1
has 1
been 1
about 1
this 1
crisis. 1

Most 1
bishops, 1
besides 1
apologies, 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
cutting 1
edge 1
of 1
change.” 1

Church 0

officials 0
began 0
bracing 0
for 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
the 0
report. 0

On 0
Monday, 0
D.C.’s 0
archbishop, 0
Cardinal 0
Donald 0
Wuerl, 0
former 0
longtime 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Pittsburgh 0
diocese, 0
warned 0
his 0
priests 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
that 0
the 0
probe 0
will 0
be 0
“profoundly 1
disturbing.” 1

REMNANT 0
COMMENT: 0
The 0
report 0
also 0
shows 0
that 0
“more 0
than 0
90 0
‘offenders’ 0
will 0
be 0
listed” 0
in 0
Donald 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl’s 0
former 0
diocese, 0
which 0
is 0
ironic 0
since 0
Wuerl 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
closest 0
U.S. 0
advisers 0
and 0
sits 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
bishop 0
oversight 0
committee. 0

Well 1
played, 1
Cardinal 1
Wuerl! 1

So, 0
let 0
me 0
get 0
this 0
straight 0
(I 0
know, 1
lots 1
of 1
luck 1
with 1
that 1
one): 1
These 1
are 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
"accompany 1
us" 1
and 1
our 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
"synodal 1
Church" 1
with 1
its 1
new 1
orientation, 1
overseen 0
by 0
a 1
"God 1
of 1
Surprises" 1
who 1
is 1
uber-merciful 1
and 1
doesn't 1
judge, 1
and 0
headed 0
up 0
by 0
a 1
pope 1
who, 1
according 1
to 1
Father 1
Thomas 1
Rosica, 1
"breaks 1
Catholic 1
traditions 1
whenever 1
he 1
wants, 1
because 1
he 1
is 1
'free 1
from 1
disordered 1
attachments'?'' 1

You 1
don't 1
say! 1

All 1
this 1
and 1
rampant 1
homosexuality 1
in 1
the 1
priesthood, 1
too... 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
"trivialized 1
liturgy" 1
(according 1
to 1
Pope 1
Benedict 1
XVI) 1
and 1
widespread 1
apostasy 1
among 1
the 1
faithful? 1

Remind 1
me 1
again: 1
What 1
exactly 1
has 1
Vatican 1
II 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
fifty 1
years 1
of 1
aggiornamento 1
given 1
us? 1

Because 1
I 1
can't 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
a 1
darn 1
thing, 1
apart 1
from 1
heretical 1
homilies, 1
sodomitical 1
clergy 1
and 1
an 1
increasingly 1
lavender 1
liturgy. 1

You 1
know 1
what, 1
guys? 1

Thanks, 1
but 1
no 1
thanks. 1

You 1
can 1
take 1
your 1
'Church 1
of 1
Accompaniment" 1
to 1
prison 1
with 1
you. 1

I'd 1
sooner 1
let 1
my 1
kids 1
be 1
accompanied 1
by 1
fans 1
of 1
the 1
Oakland 1
Raiders 1
than 1
turn 1
them 1
over 1
to 1
you... 1
meaning 0
no 0
disrespect 0
to 0
fans 0
of 0
the 0
Oakland 0
Raiders, 0
of 0
course. 0

in 0
the 0
Saudi 0
consulate 0
and 0
a 0
nearby 0
residence 0
on 0
Tuesday. 0

Erdogan 0
later 0
complained 0
that 0
the 0
interior 0
walls 0
had 0
been 0
repainted 0
in 0
recent 0
days. 0

On 0
his 0
flight 0
from 0
Riyadh 0
to 0
Ankara, 0
Pompeo 1
reiterated 1
his 1
confidence 1
that 1
the 1
Saudi 1
government 1
would 1
conduct 1
a 1
“thorough, 1
complete, 1
and 1
transparent 1
investigation,” 1
adding 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
“show 1
the 1
entire 1
world” 1
the 1
results. 1

He 0
said 0
Saudi 0
leaders 0
made 0
a 0
commitment 0
“to 0
hold 0
anyone 0
connected 0
to 0
any 0
wrongdoing 0
that 0
may 0
be 0
found 0
accountable 0
for 0
that, 0
whether 0

He 0
said 0
they 0
made 0
“no 0
exceptions,” 0
including 0
presumably 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
royal 0
family. 0

Asked 0
if 0
the 0
Saudis 0
had 0
informed 0
him 0
whether 0
Khashoggi 0
was 0
alive 0
or 0
dead, 0
Pompeo 0
said, 0
“I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
facts. 0

They 0
didn’t 0
want 0
to 0
either, 0
in 0
that 0
they 0
want 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
complete 0
this 0

in 0
a 0
thorough 0
way.” 0

Asked 0
if 0
he 0
believed 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers’ 0
repeated 0
denial 0
of 0
complicity, 0
Pompeo 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
reserving 0
judgment. 0

“I 0
think 0
that’s 0
— 0
I 0
think 0
that’s 0
— 0
I 0
think 0
that’s 0
a 0
reasonable 0
thing 0
to 0
do, 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
that 0
opportunity,” 0
Pompeo 0
said, 0
“(and 0
then) 0
we’ll 0
all 0
get 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
work 0
that 0
they 0
do.” 0

Pompeo 0
refused 0
to 0
discuss 0
possible 0
consequences 0
for 0
those 0
found 0
responsible 0
for 0
Khashoggi’s 0
disappearance, 0
reiterating 0
at 0
least 0
three 0
times 0
the 0
“importance 0
of 0
the 0
investigation.” 0

Later 0
Wednesday, 0
Pompeo 0
said 0
during 0
a 0
refueling 0
stopover 0
in 0
Brussels 0
that 0
Erdogan 0
had 0
informed 0
him 0
the 0
Saudis 0
were 0
cooperating 0
with 0
the 0
Turkish 0
investigation 0
“after 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
delays.” 0

Turkish 0
officials 0
“seemed 0
pretty 0
confident 0
the 0
Saudis 0
will 0
permit 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
things 0
they 0
need 0
to 0
do 0
to 0
complete” 0
the 0
investigation, 0
Pompeo 0
told 0

traveling 0
with 0
him. 0

In 0

the 0
administration 0
is 0
looking 0
to 0
help 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
its 0
dilemma, 0
Pompeo 0
urged 0
Americans 0
to 0
be 0
mindful 0
of 0
the 0
extensive 0
energy, 0
economic 0
and 0
security 0
ties 0
between 0
Riyadh 0
and 0
Washington, 0
including 0
efforts 0
against 0
what 0
he 0
called 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
supporter 0
of 0
terrorism, 0
Iran. 0

“The 0
Saudis 0
have 0
been 0
great 1
partners 1
in 0
working 0
alongside 0
us 0
on 0
these 0
issues,” 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

“We 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
we 0
are 0
mindful 0
of 0
that 0
as 0
we 0
approach 0
decisions” 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
impose 0
sanctions 0
or 0
take 0
other 0
punitive 0
steps 0
against 0
Riyadh, 0
as 0
many 0
in 0
Congress 0
and 0
elsewhere 0
have 0
urged. 0

Critics 0
questioned 0
whether 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers, 0
who 0
preside 0
over 0
an 0
authoritarian 0
regime 0
that 0
allows 0
little 0

can 0
be 0
relied 0
on 0
to 0
conduct 0
a 0
credible 0
probe 0
into 0
Khashoggi’s 0
fate 0
— 0
especially 0
without 0
decisive 0
pressure 0
from 0
their 0
close 0
ally, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration. 0

Saudi 0
leaders 0
for 0
two 0
weeks 0
denied 0
knowing 0
anything 0
about 0
the 0
Khashoggi 0
case. 0

On 0
Monday, 0
they 0
began 0
floating 0
a 0
scenario 0
— 0
initially 0
adopted 0
by 0
Trump 0
— 0
that 0
blamed 0
the 0
murder 0
inside 0
the 0
consulate 0
on 0
“rogue 0
killers,” 0
and 0
then 0
suggested 0
the 0
writer 0
was 0
accidentally 0
killed 0
during 0
an 0
interrogation 0
that 0
went 0
awry. 0

Analysts 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
desert 0
kingdom 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
likely 0
Saudi 0
leaders 0
were 0
hoping 0
the 0
scandal 0
would 0
blow 0
over 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
wait 0
it 0
out. 0

“We 0
received 0
commitments 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
complete 0
this 0
(investigation), 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
counting 0
on 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
that,” 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

“They 0
gave 0
me 0
their 0
word.” 0

said, 0
“will 0
be 0
transparent 0
for 0
everyone 0
to 0
see, 0
to 0
ask 0
questions 0
about, 0
to 0
inquire 0
with 0
respect 0
to 0
its 0
thoroughness.” 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
president 0
“that 0
we 0
ought 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
a 0
few 0
more 0
days 0
to 0
complete 0
that 0
so 0
that 0
we 0
too 0
have 0
a 0
complete 0
understanding 0
of 0
the 0
facts” 0
before 0
making 0
decisions 0
on 0
how 0
the 0
U.S. 0
should 0
respond. 0

Turkey 0
is 0
conducting 0
its 0
own 0
probe, 0
and 0
Pompeo 0
said 0
those 0
results 0
will 0
also 0
be 0
taken 0
into 0
consideration. 0

He 0
again 0
stressed 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
as 0
a 0
strategic 0
ally, 0
in 0
a 0
relationship, 0
he 0
noted, 0
that 0
dates 0
back 0
more 0
than 0
80 0
years. 0

The 0
administration’s 0
reluctance 0
to 0
condemn 0
the 0
Saudi 0
government 0
has 0
fueled 0
criticism 0
from 0
Democrats 0
and 0
Republicans 0
in 0
Congress, 0
from 0
diplomats 0
and 0
from 0
even 0
some 0
corporations 0
that 0
long 0
have 0
profited 0
from 0
close 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
Saudi 0
royal 0
family. 0

“We 0
just 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
allow 0
the 0
process 0
to 0
move 0
forward, 0
allow 0
the 0
facts 0
to 0
unfold,” 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

“And 0
as 0
they 0
unfold, 0
as 0
we 0
make 0
a 0
determination 0
for 0
ourselves 0
about 0
what 0
happened 0
there, 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
facts 0
that 0
are 0
presented 0
to 0
us, 0
the 1
United 1
States 1
will 0
determine 0
what 0
the 0
appropriate 0
response 0
might 0
be.” 0

The 1
Dictator 1
Pope: 1
A 0
Call 0
to 0
Hierarchical 0
Opposition 0

Of 0
that 0
book, 0
no 0
less 0
than 0
Robert 0
Royal—signaling 0
growing 0
alarm 0
over 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
Debacle 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
mainstream— 0
has 0
written 0
: 0
“About 0
90 0
percent 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
simply 0
incontrovertible, 0
and 0
cannot 0
help 0
but 0
clarify 0
who 0
Francis 0
is 0
and 0
what 0
he’s 0
about.” 0
And 0
the 0
picture 0
that 0
emerges 0
in 0
stark 0
relief 0
in 0
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope, 0
as 0
Life 0
Site 0
News 0
reports 0
, 0
is 0
that 0
of 0
“a 0
power-hungry, 1
manipulative 1
dictator, 1
[who] 1
celebrated 1
the 1
abdication 1
of 1
Benedict 1
XVI” 1
because 0
he 0
knew 0
what 0
it 0
meant: 0
that 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
give 0
him 0
the 0
Keys 0
of 0
Peter 0
in 0
2005 0
would 0
finally 0
come 0
to 0
fruition 0
in 0
2013. 0

“We 1
elected 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
reforms, 1
not 1
to 1
smash 1
everything!” 1
Thus 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
Leonardi 0
Sandri, 0
a 0
fellow 0
Argentinian 0
and 0
a 0
supporter 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
at 0
the 0
conclave 0
of 0
2013, 0
reliably 0
reported 0
literally 0
to 0
have 0
screamed 0
at 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
behind 0
closed 0
doors 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican. 0

Sandri 0
would 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Bergoglian 0
partisans 0
at 0
the 0
conclave 0
who 0
are 0
now 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
experiencing 0
“buyer’s 0
remorse,” 0
as 0
documented 0
most 0
recently 0
in 1
the 1
explosive 1
best-seller 1
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope 0
. 0

"When 0
the 0
shepherd 0
becomes 0
a 0
wolf, 0
the 0
first 0
duty 0
of 0
the 0
flock 0
is 0
to 0
defend 0
itself. 0

The 0
true 0
children 0
of 0
Holy 0
Church, 0
at 0
such 0
times, 0
are 0
those 0
who 0
walk 0
by 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
their 0
Baptism, 0
not 0
the 0
cowardly 0
souls 0
who, 0
under 0
the 0
specious 0
pretext 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
the 0
powers 0
that 0
be, 0
delay 0
their 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
enemy 0
in 0
the 0
hope 0
of 0
receiving 0
instructions 0
which 0
are 0
neither 0
necessary 0
nor 0
desirable." 0

Francis, 0
writes 0
Royal, 0
“has 0
little 0
use 0
for 0
established 0
procedures, 0
precedents, 0
even 0
legal 0
structures 0
within 0
the 0
Church…. 0

When 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
himself 0
does 0
not 0
much 0
feel 0
bound 0
by 0
the 0
tradition 0
or 0
impartial 0
laws 0
he 0
has 0
inherited, 0
what 0
then?” 0
What 0
then 0
indeed? 0

The 1
Dictator 1
Pope 1
even 0
feels 0
at 0
liberty 0
to 0
demand 0
that 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer 0
be 0
changed 0
to 0
reflect 0
his 0
dissatisfaction 0
with 0
God’s 0
words: 0
“And 0
lead 0
us 0
not 0
into 0
temptation 0
[et 0
ne 0
nos 0
inducas 0
in 0
tentationem],” 0
which 0
Francis 0
has 0
decided, 0
after 0
2,000 0
years, 0
is 0
a 0
“not 0
a 0
good 0
translation.” 0
Apparently 0
lost 0
on 0
Francis, 0
given 1
the 1
disordered 1
mélange 1
of 1
bits 1
and 1
pieces 1
of 1
things 1
he 1
has 1
read 1
that 1
constitutes 1
his 1
theology, 1
is 0
the 0
distinction 0
between 0
sin, 0
a 0
culpable 0
act, 0
and 0
temptation, 0
which 0
arises 0
from 0
concupiscence 0
or 0
what 0
Saint 0
Thomas 0
called 0
the 0
fomes, 0
or 0
the 0
fleshly 0
inclination 0
to 0
sin, 0
which 0
grace 0
enables 0
us 0
to 0
control 0
by 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
reason 0
over 0
the 0
passions. 0

But 0
now 0
we 0
are 0
witness 0
to 0
the 0
single 1
worst 1
act 1
of 1
tyranny 1
in 0
the 0
entire 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
papacy. 0

The 0
Church 0
has 0
seen 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Popes 0
who 0
have 0
abused 0
their 0
power, 0
Alexander 0
VI 0
being 0
the 0
most 0
popularly 0
known 0
example. 0

But 1
never, 1
before 1
Francis, 1
has 1
there 1
been 1
a 1
Pope 1
who 1
dared 1
to 1
tyrannize 1
the 1
Magisterium 1
itself 1
by 1
attempting 1
to 1
bend 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
errant 1
personal 1
opinions. 1

By 0
publication 0
in 0
the 0
Acta 0
Apostolicae 0
Sedis 0
(AAS), 0
Francis 0
has 0
officially 0
declared 0
that 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
includes 0
the 0
guidelines 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
for 0
the 0
implementation 0
of 0
Chapter 0
8 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
(AL), 0
which 0
he 0
expressly 0
approved 0
in 0
his 0
letter 0
to 0
them 0
as 0
the 0
only 0
correct 0
interpretation 0
of 0
his 0
will. 0

The 0
guidelines 0
have 0
been 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
AAS 0
along 0
with 0
Francis’s 0
private 0
missive, 0
which 0
is 0
suddenly 0
declared 0
to 0
be 0
“an 0
apostolic 0
letter.” 0

The 0
normalist 0
narrative 0
has 0
just 0
been 0
stripped 0
of 0
any 0
colorable 0
argument 0
that 0
nothing 0
is 0
too 0
terribly 0
amiss 0
with 0
this 0
pontificate. 0

We 0
are 0
now 0
expected 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium”—meaning 0
simply 0
and 0
only 0
AL—teaches 0
what 0
the 0
guidelines 0
preposterously 0
declare, 0
solely 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
AL: 0

When 0
the 0
concrete 0
circumstances 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
make 0
it 0
feasible, 0
especially 0
when 0
both 0
are 0
Christians 0
with 0
a 0
journey 0
of 0
faith, 0
one 0
may 0
propose 0
that 0
they 0
commit 0
to 0
living 0
in 0
continence…. 0

In 0

other 0
more 0
complex 0
circumstances, 0
and 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
possible 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
declaration 0
of 0
nullity, 0
the 0
aforementioned 0
option 0
may 0
not, 0
in 0
fact, 0
be 0
viable. 0

Nonetheless, 0
it 0
is 0
equally 0
possible 0
to 0
undertake 0
a 0
journey 0
of 0
discernment…. 0

[I]f 0
one 0
arrives 0
at 0
the 0
recognition 0
that, 0
in 0
a 0
concrete 0
case, 0
there 0
are 0
limitations 0
that 0
diminish 0
responsibility 0
and 0
culpability 0
(cf. 0

301-302), 0
particularly 0
when 0
a 0
person 0
judges 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
fall 0
into 0
a 0
subsequent 0
fault 0
by 0
damaging 0
the 0
children 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
union, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
opens 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
Sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
(cf. 0

notes 0
336 0
and 0
351). 0

As 0
Francis 0
would 0
have 0
it, 0
then, 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
has 0
just 0
flatly 0
contradicted 0
itself 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
in 0
two 0
millennia: 0

The 0
admission 0
of 0
public 0
adulterers 0
in 0
“second 0
marriages” 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion, 0
which 0
John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
Tradition, 0
called 0
“ 0
intrinsically 0
impossible 0
” 0
given 0
their 0
objective 0
state 0
in 0
life, 0
is 0
now 0
deemed 0
possible 0
depending 0
on 0
circumstances—that 0
is, 0
situation 0
ethics 0
applied 0
to 0
violations 0
of 0
the 0
Sixth 0
Commandment. 0

The 0

requirement 0
that 0
people 0
embroiled 0
in 0
such 0
unions 0
commit 0
to 0
living 0
in 0
continence 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
be 0
absolved 0
and 0
partake 0
of 0
the 0
Blessed 0
Sacrament—a 0
moral 0
norm 0
binding 0
“ 0
without 0
exception 0
” 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
rooted 0
in 0
divine 0
law—is 0
suddenly 0
demoted 0
to 0
a 0
mere 0
“proposal” 0
that 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
“feasible” 0
or 0
“viable” 0
in 0
“the 0
concrete 0
circumstances 0
of 0
the 0
couple.” 0

A 0
valid 0
annulment 0
of 0
a 0
truly 0
invalid 0
marriage, 0
the 0
sine 0
qua 0
non 0
for 0
entering 0
into 0
marital 0
relations 0
with 0
another 0
purported 0
spouse, 0
is 0
now 0
dispensed 0
with 0
in 0
“more 0
complex 0
circumstances… 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
possible 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
declaration 0
of 0
nullity,” 0
the 0
way 0
thus 0
being 0
opened 0
to 0
de 0
facto 0
divorce 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

The 0
meaningless 0
slogan 0
“journey 0
of 0
discernment” 0
cloaks 0
a 0
naked 0
authorization 0
for 0
the 0
official 0
toleration 0
of 0
adulterous 0
sexual 0
relations 0
in 0
the 0
Church’s 0
sacramental 0
life. 0

No 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
lends 0
his 0
name 0
to 0
the 0
outrageous 0
claim 0
that 0
children 0
resulting 0
from 0
an 0
adulterous 0
relationship, 0
blithely 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
“new 0
union,” 0
could 0
be 0
“damaged” 0
if 0
the 0
partners 0
in 0
adultery 0
were 0
required 0
to 0
cease 0
their 0
adultery 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
be 0
absolved 0
and 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion—evidently 0
because 0
the 0
“new 0
union” 0
would 0
dissolve 0
without 0
adulterous 0
sexual 0
relations 0
and 0
there 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
second 0
divorce! 0

As 0
recently 0
as 0
seventeen 0
years 0
ago, 0
during 0
the 0
reign 0
of 0
John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council 0
for 0
the 0
Interpretation 0
of 0
Legislative 0
texts 0
reaffirmed 0
the 0
immutable 0
truth 0
reflected 0
in 0
Canon 0
915, 0
which 0
prohibits 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
to 0
those 0
“who 0
obstinately 0
persist 0
in 0
manifest 0
grave 0
sin.” 0
That 0
prohibition, 0
declared 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council, 0
applies 0
to 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
not 0
as 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
mere 0
disciplinary 0
law 0
subject 0
to 0
revocation 0
or 0
modification, 0
but 0
rather 0
“is 1
derived 1
from 1
divine 1
law 1
and 1
transcends 1
the 1
domain 1
of 1
positive 1
ecclesiastical 1
laws; 1
[and] 0
the 0
latter 0
cannot 0
introduce 0
legislative 0
changes 0
which 0
would 0
oppose 0
the 0
doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Church.” 0

Francis, 0
however, 0
has 0
purported 0
to 0
do 0
nothing 0
less 0
invent 0
exceptions 0
to 0
divine 0
law 0
that 0
oppose 0
the 0
doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
attempt 0
is 0
void, 0
of 0
course, 0
and 0
the 0
appellation 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
is 0
fraudulent. 0

But 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
this 0
Pope’s 0
toying 1
with 1
the 1
teaching 1
office 1
of 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
advance 0
half-baked 1
theological 1
notions, 1
such 0
as 0
“discernment” 0
(a 0
term 0
he 0
borrows 0
from 0
St. 0
Ignatius 0
of 0
Loyola 0
but 0
strips 0
of 0
its 0
original 0
meaning) 0
are 0
catastrophic. 0

Over 0
the 0
past 0
year, 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
and 0
a 0
few 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
have 0
called 0
upon 0
Francis 0
to 0
“clarify” 0
his 0
intention 0
respecting 0
AL. 0

That 0
clarification 0
has 0
now 0
been 0
given: 0
Francis 0
intends, 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
possible, 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
unchangeable 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
regarding 0
an 0
irrevocable 0
moral 0
norm 0
rooted 0
in 0
divine 0
law. 0

Even 1
if 1
the 1
attempt 1
is 1
void 1
and 1
of 1
no 1
effect 1
before 1
man 1
and 1
God—an 1
immoral 1
law 1
is 1
no 1
law 1
at 1
all—Francis 0
clearly 0
means 0
to 0
impose 0
his 0
will 0
by 0
fiat, 0
daring 0
invoke 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
to 0
cloak 1
his 1
absurd 1
novelties. 1

No 1
Pope 1
before 1
him 1
has 1
ever 1
dared 1
to 1
do 1
such 1
a 1
thing. 1

So 0
now 0
it 0
must 0
be 0
asked: 0
Where 0
are 0
the 0
cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
bishops? 0

With 0
one 0
or 0
two 0
noble 0
(however 0
inconsistent) 0
exceptions, 0
their 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
Debacle 0
thus 0
far 0
ranges 0
from 0
silence, 0
to 0
active 0
complicity, 0
to—at 0
best—hand-wringing 0
over 0
the 0
increasingly 0
chaotic 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
while 0
begging 0
the 0
Pope 0
to 0
“clarify” 0
his 0
already 0
perfectly 0
clear 0
intentions. 0

At 0
this 0
point, 0
continued 0
pleading 0
for 0
a 0
Bergoglian 0
“clarification” 0
can 0
only 0
give 0
rise 0
to 0
an 0
impression 0
of 0
disingenuousness, 0
whereas 0
continued 0
silence 0
about 0
the 0
papal 0
origin 0
of 0
this 0
ongoing 0
catastrophe 0
is 1
a 1
standing 1
rebuke 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
hierarchs 1
who 1
know 1
what 1
we 1
all 1
know: 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
epicenter 1
of 1
the 1
chaos 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
wayward 1
Pope 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
ever 1
had 1
to 1
endure. 1

Continued 1
inaction 1
while 1
the 1
laity 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
good 1
priests 1
are 1
left 1
to 1
themselves 1
to 1
defend, 1
as 1
best 1
they 1
can, 1
the 1
constant 1
teaching 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
against 1
the 1
abuses 1
of 1
a 1
tyrant 1
on 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter 1
threatens 1
the 1
hierarchs 1
with 1
a 1
legacy 1
of 1
shame 1
and 1
a 1
terrible 1
accountability 1
before 1
the 1
Just 1
Judge. 1

Their 0
failure 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Faith 0
by 0
standing 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
one 0
they 0
know 0
full 0
well 0
is 0
attacking 0
it 0
almost 0
daily 0
lends 0
itself 0
ever 0
more 0
to 0
an 0
indictment 0
for 0
timidity 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
unprecedented 0
danger 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
cause 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel 0
of 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
divinely 0
charged 0
to 0
be 0
leaders. 0

The 1
time 1
for 1
“prudence” 1
is 1
long 1
past. 1

Prudence 0
now 0
gives 0
way 0
to 0
mere 0
pusillanimity. 0

The 0
time 0
for 0
hierarchical 0
action 0
is 0
now, 0
before 0
the 0
damage 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
becomes 0
irreparable. 0

The 0
members 0
of 0
a 0
hierarchy 0
seemingly 0
cowed 0
by 0
a 1
papal 1
tyranny 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
never 1
before 1
seen 1
must 0
rise 0
immediately 0
and 0
give 0
a 0
courageous 0
answer 0
to 0
the 0
challenge 0
posed 0
long 0
ago 0
by 0
Monsignor 0
Klaus 0
Gamber, 0
when 0
an 0
already 0
monumental 0
ecclesial 0
crisis 0
was 0
still 0
in 0
what 0
can 0
now 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
merely 0
a 0
preliminary 0
stage: 0

Where 0
in 0
our 0
Church 0
are 0
the 0
leaders 0
who 0
can 0
show 0
us 0
the 0
right 0
path? 0

Where 0
are 0
the 0
bishops 0
courageous 0
enough 0
to 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
cancerous 1
growth 1
of 1
modernist 1
theology 1
that 1
has 1
implanted 1
itself 1
and 1
is 1
festering 1
within 1
the 1
celebration 1
of 1
even 1
the 1
most 1
sacred 1
mysteries, 1
before 1
the 1
cancer 1
spreads 1
and 1
causes 1
even 1
greater 1
damage? 1

What 0
we 0
need 0
today 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
Athanasius, 0
a 0
new 0
Basil, 0
bishops 0
like 0
those 0
who 0
in 0
the 0
fourth 0
century 0
fought 0
courageously 0
against 0
Arianism 0
when 0
almost 0
the 0
whole 0
of 0
Christendom 0
had 0
succumbed 0
to 0
heresy. 0

Will 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchs 0
rise 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Church 0
as 0
“a 0
new 0
Athanasius, 0
a 0
new 0
Basil”? 0

Even 0
the 0
best 0
among 0
them 0
continue 0
to 0
limit 0
themselves 0
to 0
generalized 0
lamentations 0
at 0
conferences 0
or 0
in 0
interviews 0
about 0
the 0
parlous 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
or 0
at 0
most 0
the 0
“confusion” 0
Francis 0
has 0
caused 0
by 0
not 0
“clarifying” 0
precisely 0
what 0
he 0
has 0
just 0
clarified. 0

They 0
avoid 0
the 0
absolutely 0
necessary 0
direct 0
and 0
public 0
exposure 0
of 0
error 0
at 0
its 0
source. 0

That 1
error 1
threatens 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
the 1
Church 1
while 1
they 1
do 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
fret 1
about 1
a 1
situation 1
whose 1
self-evident 1
cause—a 1
reckless 1
Pope 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
ideas 1
and 1
filled 1
with 1
contempt 1
for 1
Tradition—they 1
seem 1
incapable 1
of 1
identifying. 1

Concerned 0
clergy 0
and 0
laity 0
throughout 0
the 0
Catholic 0
world 0
are 0
doing 0
what 0
they 0
can 0
according 0
to 0
their 0
stations. 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
that 0
“final 0
battle” 0
over 0
marriage 0
and 0
family 0
of 0
which 0
Sister 0
Lucia 0
warned 0
the 0
late 0
Cardinal 0
Caffarra 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
of 0
Fatima, 0
within 0
the 0
human 0
element 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
only 0
the 0
cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
bishops 0
possess 0
the 1
divinely 1
bestowed 1
power 1
to 1
repel 1
an 1
assault 1
on 1
marriage, 1
family 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
Faith 1
that 1
is 1
now, 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
Church 1
history, 1
being 0
led 0
by 0
a 0
Roman 0
Pontiff. 0

This 0
undeniably 0
apocalyptic 0
development 0
imposes 0
upon 0
the 0
hierarchs—first 0
and 0
foremost 0
in 0
the 0
Church—the 0
duty 0
to 0
act. 0

True 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
Church, 1
indeed 1
true 1
charity 1
toward 1
Francis 1
himself, 1
requires 1
of 1
them 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
what 1
was 1
required 1
of 1
Saint 1
Paul 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
Pope 1
fell 1
into 1
error 1
that 1
jeopardized 1
the 1
very 1
mission 1
of 1
the 1
Church: 1
that 1
Peter 1
be 1
withstood 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
(Gal. 1

2:11). 1

May 1
Our 1
Lady 1
of 1
Fatima 1
intercede 1
to 1
obtain 1
for 1
them 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
fortitude 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
what 1
only 1
they 1
can 1
do. 1

Our 1

Eyewitness 0
Confessional: 0
There 0
Was 0
An 0
Active 0
Shooter 0
Targeting 0
The 0
Bellagio 0
Hotel 0
During 0
The 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Massacre 0

In 0
yet 0
another 0
astonishing 1
eyewitness 1
report 1
that 0
contradicts 0
the 0
official 0
story 0
surrounding 0
the 0
worst 0
mass 0
shooting 0
in 0
American 0
history, 0
a 0
married 0
couple 0
who 0
were 0
celebrating 0
their 0
10th 0
anniversary 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
have 0
come 0
forward 0
to 0
reveal 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
active 0
shooter 0
inside 0
the 0
Bellagio 0
Hotel 0
around 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
that 0
supposed 0
lone 0
gunman 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
was 0
found 0
dead. 0

During 0
the 0
confessional, 0
a 0
Canadian 0
man 0
by 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jeff 0
detailed 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
Bellagio 0
Resort 0
and 0
Casino 0
around 0
11:20pm 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
when 0
panic 0
broke 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
hotels 0
lobby. 0

Jeff 0
begins 0
the 0
interview 0
by 0
making 0
clear 0
his 0
belief 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
multiple 0
active 0
shooters 0
targeting 0
different 0
places 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
attack. 0

“First 0
of 0
all, 0
I 0
think 0
what 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
said 0
is 0
that, 0
from 0
my 0
perspective, 0
there 0
were 0
multiple 0
events 0
that 0
occurred 0
around 0
Las 0
Vegas, 0
up 0
and 0
down 0
the 0
Strip 0
that 0
night. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
just 0
centralized 0
around 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Hotel,” 0
the 0
witness 0
claimed. 0

The 0
eyewitness 0
then 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
directly 0
say 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
active 0
shooter 0
situation 0
at 0
a 0
different 0
hotel 0
that 0
authorities 0
have 0
so 0
far 0
done 0
everything 0
in 0
their 0
power 0
to 0
cover-up. 0

“My 0
wife 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
celebrating 0
our 0
10th 0
anniversary 0
and 0
on 0
October 0
1st 0
we 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
incident 0
with 0
an 0
active 0
shooter 0
at 0
the 0
Bellagio. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
mistake 0
in 0
my 0
mind 0
about 0
it,” 0
he 0
continued. 0

Jeff 0
then 0
describes 0
a 0
scene 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
were 0
walking 0
through 0
the 0
main 0
lobby 0
when 0
screams 0
and 0
gunfire 0
erupted. 0

Keep 1
in 1
mind, 1
this 1
is 1
all 1
information 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
the 1
FBI 1
has 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

“All 0
of 0
a 0
sudden 0
there 0
was 0
just 0
a 0
crescendo 0
of 0
screams 0
that 0
started 0
behind 0
us 0
in 0
the 0
lobby,” 0
he 0
claimed. 0

“Then 0
I 0
heard 0
somebody 0
yell 0
‘there’s 0
a 0
shooter! 0

There’s 0
a 0
shooter!’ 0
And 0
then 0
I 0
heard 0
like 0
five 0
or 0
six 0
pops, 0
like 0
unmistakable 0
gunfire, 0
unmistakably.” 0

“That 0
was 0
about 0
11:20 0
when 0
we 0
heard 0
the 0
shots 0
and 0
the 0
screams… 0
at 0
that 0
point 0
you 0
could 0
hear 0
and 0
see 0
the 0
screams 0
and 0
see 0
hundreds 0
of 0
people 0
coming 0
towards 0
us.” 0

Amazingly, 0
as 0
Shepard 0
Ambellas 0
noted, 0
“The 0
man’s 0
claims 0
match 0
up 0
to 0
actual 0
events 0
captured 0
in 0
police 0
audio 0
recordings 0
from 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
which 0
confirms 0
that 0
between 0
11:15 0
and 0
11:18 0
p.m. 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
Oct. 0
1 0
there 0
was, 0
in 0
fact, 0
something 0
going 0
on 0
at 0
the 0
Bellagio.” 0

This 0
testimony 0
also 0
backs 0
up 0
claims 0
by 0
another 0
eyewitness, 0
Rene 0
Downs, 0
who 0
has 0
spent 0
the 0
past 0
few 0
days 0
doing 0
interviews 0
about 0
a 0
shooter 0
inside 0
the 0
Bellagio 0
Hotel. 0

Slowly 1
but 1
surely 1
we 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
official 0
narrative 0
regarding 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Massacre 0
be 0
completely 0
destroyed. 0

At 0
this 0
point 0
it 1
is 1
strikingly 1
obvious 1
that 1
authorities 1
have 1
lied 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
about 0
the 0
worst 0
mass 0
shooting 0
in 0
our 0
countries 0
history. 0

One 1
can 1
only 1
speculate 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
reasons 1
for 1
these 1
lies 1
actually 1
are? 1

Keeping 0

I 0

a 1
lot 1
of 1
us 1
can 1
just 1
shout 1
out, 1
“What 1
are 1

thinking?” 1
as 1
President 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
brings 1
CIA 1
Director 1
Mike 1

a 1
man 1
that 1
blasted 1

for 1
revealing 1
the 1
crimes 1
of 1
our 1

Gina 1
Haspel 1
in 1
the 1

on 0

“Mike 0

March 0

2018 0

The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
first 0
reported 0
on 0
the 0
story 0
prior 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
tweet. 0

Trump 0
and 0
Tillerson 0
have 0
had 0
a 0
fraught 0
relationship 0
for 0
many 0
months. 0

Trump 0
told 0
reporters 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
ultimately 0
decided 0
to 0
fire 0
the 0
secretary 0
because 0
they 0
disagreed 0
over 0
strategy 0
in 0
key 0
areas 0
of 0
foreign 0
policy, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
2015 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
the 0
approach 0
to 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
overall 0
tone 0
of 0
U.S. 0
diplomacy. 0

Tillerson 0
said 0
he 0
received 0
a 0
call 0
from 0
Trump 0
around 0
noon 0
Tuesday, 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
hours 0
after 0
his 0
firing 0
was 0
first 0
reported 0
by 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
announced 0
minutes 0
later 0
in 0
a 0
tweet 0
from 0
the 0
president. 0

His 1
voice 1
quivering, 1
Tillerson 0
thanked 0
career 0
diplomats 0
for 0
their 0
“honesty 0
and 0
integrity” 0
and 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
for 0
“acts 0
of 0
kindness,” 0
and 0
he 0
singled 0
out 0
Defense 0
Secretary 0
Jim 0
Mattis 0
for 0
their 0
partnership 0
and 0
mutual 0
support 0
of 0
diplomacy. 0

But 0
he 0
notably 0
did 0
not 0
thank 0
Trump 0
or 0
praise 0
his 0
policies. 0

Tillerson 0
said 0
he 0
will 0
remain 0
in 0
his 0
post 0
until 0
March 0
31 0
but 0
is 0
delegating 0
all 0
authorities 0
for 0
running 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
to 0
Deputy 0
Secretary 0
John 0
Sullivan 0
and 0
is 0
committed 0
to 0
ensuring 0
“an 0

transition.” 0
The 1
deposed 1
diplomat 1
also 0
made 0
a 0

a 0
key 0
incident 0
involving 0
the 0
shooting 0
of 0
a 0
Mandalay 0

security 0
guard. 0

Originally, 0
as 0
highlighted 0
by 0
The 0
Daily 0
Sheeple, 0
the 0
security 0
guard 0
was 0
hailed 0
as 0
being 0
responsible 0
for 0
preventing 0
the 0
shooter 0
from 0
continuing 0
his 0
massacre 0
because 0
he 0
interrupted 0
him 0
in 0
the 0
middle 0
of 0
the 0
attack. 0

As 0
it 0
turns 0
out, 0
security 0
guard 0
Jesus 0
Campos 0
was 0
actually 0
shot 0
BEFORE 0
Paddock 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
concert 0
crowd 0
below 0
his 0
32nd 0
floor 0
hotel 0
suite. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
constantly 1
changing 1
story, 1
officials 0
are 0
now 0
saying 0
that 0
police 0
officers 0
who 0
rushed 0
to 0
the 0
hotel 0
room 0
when 0
the 0
shooting 0
began 0
didn’t 0

a 0
hotel 0

had 0
been 0

“until 0
they 0
met 0
him 0
in 0
the 0
hallway 0
after 0
exiting 0
the 0

The 0

was 0
struck 0
in 0
the 0
leg 0
as 0
the 0
gunman, 0
from 0
behind 0
his 0
door, 0
shot 0
into 0
the 0
hallway 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0

via 0
surveillance 0
cameras 0
he 0
set 0
up 0
outside 0
his 0
hotel 0

Paddock 0
shot 0
the 0
guard 0
at 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
local 0
time, 0
Lombardo 0
said, 0
shortly 0
before 0
raining 0
down 0
bullets 0
on 0
the 0
Route 0
91 0
Harvest 0
festival 0
in 0
an 0
attack 0
that 0
began 0
at 0
10:05 0
p.m. 0

lasted 0
10 0
minutes. 0

Police 0
officers 0
found 0
Campos 0
when 0
they 0
arrived 0
on 0
the 0
floor. 0

And 0

did 0
not 0
summon 0

to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
of 0

Mandalay 0
Bay 0
hotel, 0
according 0

the 0
timeline 0
recently 0
updated 0
by 0

What’s 0
also 0

that 0

chasing 0
another 0

in 0

here 0
is 0

timeline, 0
as 0
outlined 0
by 0
the 0
Los 0

Times: 0

The 0
new 0
timeline 0
has 0
left 0
investigators 0
and 0
researchers 0
with 0
new 0
questions, 0
two 0
of 0
which 0
are 0
extremely 0
important: 0

What 0
happened 0
during 0
the 0
6 0
minutes 0
between 0
Campos 0
being 0
shot 0
and 0
Paddock 0
opening 0
fire, 0
and 0
why 1
weren’t 1
the 1
police 1
rushing 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
immediately? 1

Why 0
did 0
shooter 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
stop 0
shooting? 0

Paddock 0
had 0
already 0
shot 0
the 0
security 0
guard, 0
waited 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
opening 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
concert 0
crowd, 0
and 0
then 0
shot 0
for 0
a 0
full 0
ten 0
minutes. 0

Police 0
didn’t 0
arrive 0
for 0
two 0
additional 0
minutes 0
after 0
the 0
shooting 0
stopped 0
– 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
full 0
18 0
minutes 0
from 0
the 0
moment 0
Campos 0
was 0
initially 0
hit. 0

Moreover, 0
did 0
he 0
stop 0
shooting 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
planning 0
his 0
escape 0
from 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor? 0

Or 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
that 0
Paddock 0
was 0
rushed 0
and 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
panic? 0

Leeann 0

Tweeden, 0
a 0
radio 0
news 0
anchor, 0
says 0
Franken 0
groped 0
and 0
forcibly 0
kissed 0
her 0
during 0
a 0
USO 0
tour 0
in 0
2006, 0
before 0
the 0
former 0
comedian 0
was 0
a 0
senator. 0

She 0
says 0
Franken 0
"aggressively 1
stuck 1
his 1
tongue 1
in 1
my 1
mouth" 1
when 0
the 0
pair 0
rehearsed 0
a 0
skit 0
that 0
featured 0
a 0
kiss. 0

A 0
photo 0
also 0
surfaced 0
showing 0
Franken 0
looking 0
at 0
a 0
camera 0
while 0
pretending 0
to 0
grab 0
Tweeden's 0
breasts 0
as 0
she 0
was 0
sleeping 0
while 0
clothed. 0

The 0
senator 0
apologized 0
for 0
the 0
photo 0
but 0
said 0
he 0
remembered 0
the 0
skit 0
incident 0
differently. 0

Lindsay 0

her 0
buttocks 0

for 0
a 0
photo 0
at 0

Minnesota 0
State 0

Franken 0
later 0
said 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
remember 0
taking 0
the 0
picture 0
but 0
"felt 0
badly" 0
that 0
Menz 0
felt 0
disrespected. 0

Two 0
other 0

Franken 0
grabbed 0
their 0
buttocks 0
at 0
separate 0
events 0
in 0
2007 0
and 0
2008. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
women 0
says 0
Franken 0
suggested 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
she 0
should 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
bathroom 0
together. 0

Franken 0

the 0
events 0
and 0

asking 0
anyone 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0

with 0
him. 0

Stephanie 0
Kemplin, 0

KINSHASA, 0

Congo's 0
government 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
declared 0
a 0
new 0
outbreak 0
of 0
Ebola 0
in 0
the 0
country's 0
rural 0
northwest, 0
after 0
two 0
cases 0
of 0
the 0
deadly 0
virus 0
were 0
confirmed 0
in 0
Bikoro. 0

Congo's 0
Health 0
Ministry 0
said 0
that 0
of 0
five 0
samples 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
National 0
Institute 0
of 0
Biological 0
Research 0
in 0
Kinshasa, 0
two 0

positive 0
for 0
the 0
Zaire 0
strain 0
of 0
Ebola 0
in 0
the 0
country's 0
Equateur 0
province. 0

The 0
samples 0
were 0
gathered 0
after 0
the 0
Equateur 0
province 0
Health 0
Ministry 0
notified 0
Kinshasa 0
on 0
May 0
3 0
of 0
some 0
21 0
cases 0
of 0
a 0
hemorrhagic 0
fever 0
in 0
the 0
Ikoko 0
Impenge 0
area, 0
including 0
17 0
deaths, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
and 0
Congo's 0
government. 0

There 0
are 0
various 0
hemorrhagic 0
fevers. 0

A 0
team 0
was 0
sent 0
by 0
the 0
WHO 0
and 0
Doctors 0
Without 0
Borders 0
over 0
the 0
weekend 0
to 0
investigate 0
and 0
strengthen 0
coordination. 0

The 0
five 0
new 0
cases 0
were 0
then 0
identified 0
and 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
laboratory, 0
Congo's 0
government 0
said. 0

Since 0
that 0
time, 0
no 0
deaths 0
have 0
been 0
reported 0
among 0
those 0
hospitalized 0
or 0
among 0
health 0
workers 0
treating 0
the 0
ill, 0
it 0
said. 0

A 0
team 0
of 0
experts 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
Bikoro 0
today 0
to 0
implement 0
measures 0
to 0
avoid 0
further 0
spread 0
of 0
the 0
disease, 0
said 0
the 0
ministry 0
statement. 0

The 0
team 0
also 0
will 0
investigate 0
how 0
the 0
outbreak 0
first 0
started, 0
it 0
said. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
ninth 0
Ebola 0
outbreak 0
in 0
Congo 0
since 0
1976, 0
when 0
the 0
disease 0
was 0
first 0
identified. 0

Congo 0
has 0
a 0
long 0
track 0
record 0
with 0
Ebola, 0
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
said. 0

The 0
most 0
recent 0
outbreak 0
was 0
in 0
May 0
2017 0
and 0
killed 0
four 0
of 0
the 0
eight 0
people 0
infected 0
in 0
Congo's 0
Bas-Uele 0
province 0
in 0
the 0
northeast. 0

That 0
outbreak 0
was 0
quickly 0
contained 0
and 0
was 0
declared 0
over 0
in 0
July. 0

None 0
of 0
these 0
outbreaks 0
was 0
connected 0
to 0
the 0
outbreak 0
in 0
Guinea, 0
Liberia 0
and 0
Sierra 0
Leone 0
that 0
began 0
in 0
2014 0
and 0
left 0
more 0
than 0
11,300 0
people 0
dead. 0

Ebola 0
occasionally 0
jumps 0
to 0
humans 0
from 0
animals, 0
including 0
bats 0
and 0
monkeys. 0

Without 0
preventive 0
measures, 0
the 0
virus 0
can 0
spread 0
quickly 0
between 0
people 0
and 0
is 0
fatal 0
in 0
up 0
to 0
90 0
percent 0
of 0
cases. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
specific 0
treatment 0
for 0
Ebola, 0
which 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
bodily 0
fluids 0
of 0
people 0
exhibiting 0
symptoms. 0

A 0
new 0
experimental 0
vaccine 0
has 0
been 0
shown 0
to 0
be 0
effective 0
against 0
the 0
virus, 0
though 0
quantities 0
are 0
currently 0
limited. 0

WHO 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
working 0
closely 0
with 0
Congo's 0
government 0
to 0
rapidly 0
scale 0
up 0
its 0
operations 0
and 0
mobilize 0
health 0
partners 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
successfully 0
in 0
Congo 0
last 0
year. 0

"Our 0
top 0
priority 0
is 0
to 0
get 0
to 0
Bikoro 0
to 0
work 0
alongside 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Republic 0
of 0

said 0
Dr. 0
Peter 0
Salama, 0

for 0

"Working 0

this 1

— 1
in 1
which 1

is 1
just 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
a 1
few 1

— 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
for 1
its 1
inexplicable 1
decision 1
to 1
settle 1
a 1
lawsuit 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
winning. 1

The 0
case 0
involves 0
Cody 0
Wilson, 0
founder 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed, 0
who 0
sued 0
the 0
government 0
in 0
2015 0
after 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
under 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
made 0
him 0
take 0
down 0
do-it-yourself 0

he 0
had 0
posted 0
online, 0
saying 0
they 0
violated 0
export 0
regulations 0
governing 0
military 0
hardware 0
and 0
technology. 0

Mr. 0
Wilson, 0
an 1
avowed 1
anarchist 1
who 1
hopes 1
for 1
a 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
governments 1
can’t 1
stop 1
individuals 1
from 1
getting 1
guns, 1
claimed 0
his 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right 0
to 0
free 0
speech 0
was 0
being 0
violated. 0

But 0
he 0
lost 0
at 0
every 0
stage 0
of 0
litigation, 0
including 0
a 0
refusal 0
by 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
to 0
review 0
a 0
decision 0
that 0
the 0
code 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
published 0
during 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

So 1
it 1
was 1
stunning 1
— 0
but 1
not 1
surprising, 1
given 1
this 1
administration’s 1
worship 1
at 1
the 1

— 0
that 0
the 0

the 0
issue 0
Wednesday 0
during 0

before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Foreign 0
Relations 0
Committee. 0

“Why 1
on 1
earth 1
would 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
make 1
it 1
easier 1
for 1
terrorists 1
and 1
gunmen 1
to 1
produce 1
undetectable 1
plastic 1
guns?” 1
asked 0
Sen. 0
Robert 0
Menendez 0
(D-N.J.). 0

Mr. 0
Pompeo 0
promised 0
to 0
“take 0
a 0
look 0
at 0
it.” 0

That’s 0
not 0
enough. 0

Ghost 1
guns 1
are 1
already 1
a 1
problem; 1
they 1
are 1
used 1
not 1
just 1
by 1
lone 1
shooters 1
but 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
criminal 1
enterprises. 1

Releasing 1
instructions 1
for 1
their 1
manufacture, 1
which 1

will 1
lead 1
directly 1
to 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
more 1

The 1

stop 1
the 1
State 1
Department 1
from 1
going 1
ahead 1
with 1
this 1
foolhardy 1
move, 1

a 0
global 1
pandemic 1
is 1
imminent, 1
and 1
no 1
one 1
will 1
be 1
prepared 1
for 1
it 1
when 1
it 1
hits. 1

Dr. 0
Tedros 0
Adhanom, 0
director-general 0
for 0
WHO, 0
has 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
next 0
outbreak 0
that 0
will 0
hit 0
us 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
“terrible” 1
one, 0
causing 0
a 0
large 0
death 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
world. 0

“Humanity 0
is 0
more 0
vulnerable 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
epidemics 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
much 0
more 0
connected 0
and 0
we 0
travel 0
around 0
much 0
more 0
quickly 0
than 0
before,” 0
said 0
WHO 0
specialist 0
in 0

Dr. 0
Sylvie 0
Brand. 0

“We 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
coming, 1
but 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
way 1
of 1
stopping 1
it,” 1
said 0
Brand. 0

According 0
to 0
Dr. 0
Tedros, 0
the 1
flu 1
is 1
extremely 1
dangerous 1
to 1
everyone 1
living 1
on 1
the 1
planet. 1

This 0
fear 0
was 0
also 0
promoted 0
by 0
experts 0
at 0
the 0
World 0
Economic 0
Forum 0
in 0
Davos, 0
Switzerland 0
last 0
month. 0

The 0
claims 0
came 0
exactly 0
100 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
1918 0
Spanish 0
flu 0
that 0
claimed 0
50 0
million 0
lives 0
and 0
killed 0
three 0
times 0
as 0
many 0
people 0
as 0
World 0
War 0
I. 0

A 0
mutated 0
strain 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
likely 0
contender 0
to 0
wipe 0
out 0
millions 0
because 0
it 0
can 0
join 0
together 0
with 0
other 0
strains 0
to 0
become 0
deadlier. 0

“This 0
is 0
not 0
some 0
future 0
nightmare 0
scenario. 0

A 1
devastating 1
epidemic 1
could 1
start 1
in 1
any 1
country 1
at 1
any 1
time 1
and 1
kill 1
millions 1
of 1
people 1
because 1
we 1
are 1
still 1
not 1
prepared. 1

The 1
world 1
remains 1
vulnerable. 1

We 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
where 1
and 1
when 1
the 1
next 1
global 1
pandemic 1
will 1
occur, 1
but 1
we 1
know 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
a 1
terrible 1
toll 1
both 1
on 1

the 0
Second 0

sued 0
the 0

arguing 0
that 0
"sharing 0

counts 0
as 0

The 0
Justice 0
Department’s 0
recent 0
settlement 0
with 0
Wilson 0
is 0
very 0
favorable 0
to 0

Wilson 0
to 0
provide 0
the 0
printing 0
instructions 0
“for 0
public 0
release 0
(meaning 0
unlimited 0
distribution) 0
in 0
any 0
form.” 0
The 0
government 0
also 0
compensated 0
$40,000 0
of 0
Wilson’s 0
legal 0
costs. 0

While 0
this 0
settlement 0
is 0
a 0
victory 0
for 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights, 0
it 1
will 1
be 1
difficult, 1
if 1
not 1
impossible, 1
for 0
the 0
government 0
to 0
regulate 0
either 0
the 0
printers 0
or 0
the 0
guns 0
that 0
are 0
made 0
with 0
them. 0

How 0
the 0
government 0
will 0
stop 0
people 0
from 0
obtaining 0
these 0
printers 0
isn’t 0
exactly 0
obvious. 0

Proposals 0
to 0
require 0
background 0
checks, 0
mandatory 0
serial 0
numbers 0
and 0
even 0
a 0
registration 0
process 0
for 0
printers 0
are 0
easily 0
defeated. 0

Even 0
if 0
printers 0
are 0
registered 0
with 0
the 0
government, 0
what 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
stop 0
gangs 0
from 0
stealing 0
them? 0

And 0
the 0
designs 0
for 0
making 0
your 0
own 0
printer 0
have 0
been 0
available 0
on 0
the 0
Internet 0
for 0
years. 0

3D 0
printers 0
make 1
the 1
already 1
extremely 1
difficult 1
job 1
of 1
controlling 1
access 1
to 1
guns 1
practically 1
impossible. 1

The 0
government 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
ban 0
guns, 0
and 0
limits 0
on 0
the 0
size 0
of 0
bullet 0
magazines 0
will 0
be 0
even 1
more 1
laughable 1
than 0
before. 0

Many 0
parts 0
of 0
a 0
gun 0
can 0
be 0
made 0
on 0
very 0
inexpensive, 0
plastic 0
3D 0
printers 0
or 0
even 0
from 0
simple 0
machine 0
tools. 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
even 0
more 0
difficult 0
to 0
impose 0
background 0
checks, 0
which 1
have 1
proven 1
quite 1
useless 1
anyway. 1

The 1
government 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
more 1
effective 1
at 1
stopping 1
criminals 1
from 1
getting 1
guns 1
than 1
at 1
stopping 1
them 1
from 1
obtaining 1
drugs. 1

That 0
isn’t 0
too 0
surprising, 0
as 0
drug 0
gangs 0
are 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
both 0
illegal 0
drugs 0
and 0
guns. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
tough 0
battle 0
for 0
the 0
plaintiff's, 0
SAF 0
and 0
DD. 0

They 0
lost 0
many 0
lower 0
court 0
rulings. 0

Gun-control 0
advocates 0
believe 0
that 0
the 1
government 1
"capitulated" 1
too 0
soon. 0

J. 0
Adam 0
Skaggs, 0
the 0
chief 0
counsel 0
for 0
the 0
Giffords 0
Law 0
Center 0
to 0
Prevent 0
Gun 0
Violence, 0
said 0
the 1
administration 1
“capitulated 1
in 0
a 0
case 0
it 0
had 0
won 0
at 0
every 0
step 0
of 0
the 0
way. 0

This 1
isn’t 1
a 1
case 1
where 1
the 1
underlying 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
changed. 1

The 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
changed 1
was 1
the 1
administration.” 1

The 0
concept 0
of 0
making 0
guns 0
with 0
3D 0
printers 0
in 0
an 0
age 0
where 0
just 0
one 0
year 0
can 0
render 0
much 0
technology 0
obsolete 0
shouldn't 0
surprise 0
anyone. 0

Nor 0
should 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
instructions 0
for 0
gun 0
assembly 0
are 0
easily 0
available 0
for 0
download 0
over 0
the 0
internet. 0

At 0
the 0
click 0
of 0
a 0

we 0
can 0
summon 0
almost 0
any 0
information 0
we 0
could 0
possibly 0
need 0
including 0
instructions 0
for 0
making 0
a 0
bomb. 0

The 0
ability 0
to 0
build 0
an 0
untraceable, 0
unregistered 0
gun 0
is 0
definitely 0
a 1
game 1
changer. 1

It's 0
difficult 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
"ghost 1
guns" 1
could 0
ever 0
be 0
regulated 0
by 0
the 0
government. 0

The 0
real 0
"Mr. 1

was 0
a 0
true 0
profile 0
in 0
courage. 0

Flake, 0
with 0
only 0
18 0
percent 0
approval 0
in 0
Arizona, 0
decided 0
to 0
pack 0
it 0
in 0
rather 0
than 0
get 0
waxed 0
in 0
his 0
own 0
primary. 0

With 0
Falstaff, 0
Flake 0
appears 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
"discretion 1
is 1
the 1
better 1
part 1
of 1
valor." 1

Sen. 0
Bob 0
Corker 0
is 0
another 0
summertime 1
soldier 1
calling 0
on 0
colleagues 0
to 0
stand 0
and 0
fight 0
Trump 0
while 1
he 1
retires 1
to 1
Tennessee. 1

It's 0
no 0
wonder 0
the 0
establishment 0
is 0
viewed 0
with 0
such 0
derision. 1

Flake 0
calls 0
Trump 0
"dangerous 1
to 1
our 1
democracy." 1

But 0
the 0
real 0
threat 0
Trump 0
represents 0
is 0
to 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment's 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
party's 0
agenda 0
and 0
the 0
party's 0
destiny. 0

U.S. 0
politics 0
have 0
indeed 0
been 0
coarsened, 0
with 0
Trump 0
playing 0
a 0
lead 0
role. 0

Yet, 0
beneath 0
the 0
savagery 1
of 0
the 0
uncivil 0
war 0
in 0
the 0
party 0
lies 0
more 0
than 0
personal 0
insults 0
and 0
personality 0
clashes. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
struggle 0
about 0
policy, 0
about 1
the 1
future. 1

And 0
Trump 1
is 1
president 1
because 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
party 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
right, 1
while 0
the 0
Bush-McCain 0
Republican 0
establishment 0
had 0
lost 0
touch 0
with 0
both. 0

How 1
could 1
the 1

GOP 1
not 1
see 1
that 0
its 0
defining 0
policies 0
— 0
open 0
borders, 0
amnesty, 0
free 0
trade 0
globalism, 0
compulsive 0
military 0
intervention 0
in 0
foreign 0
lands 0
for 0
ideological 0
ends 0
— 0
were 0
alienating 0
its 0
coalition? 0

What 1
had 1
a 1
quarter 1
century 1
of 1
Bushite 1
free 1
trade 1
produced? 1

About 0
$12 0
trillion 0
in 0
trade 0
deficits, 0
$4 0
trillion 0
with 0
China 0
alone, 0
a 0
loss 0
of 0
55,000 0
plants 0
and 0
6 0

manufacturing 0
jobs. 0

We 0
imported 0
goods 0
"Made 0
in 0
China," 0
while 0
exporting 0
our 1

U.S. 0
elites 0
made 0
China 0

again, 0
to 0
where 0
Beijing 0
is 0
now 0
challenging 0
our 0
strategic 0
position 0
and 0
presence 0
in 0
Asia. 0

Could 1
Republicans 1
not 1
see 1
the 0
factories 0
shutting 0
down, 0
or 0
not 0
understand 0
why 0
workers' 0
wages 0
had 0
failed 0
to 0
rise 0
for 0
decades? 0

What 0
did 0
the 0
democracy 0
crusades 0
"to 1
end 1
tyranny 1
in 1
our 1
world" 1
accomplish? 0

Thousands 0
of 0
U.S. 1
dead, 1
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
wounded, 1
trillions 1
of 1
dollars 1
sunk, 1
and 0
a 0
Mideast 0
awash 1
in 1
blood 1
from 0
Afghanistan 0
to 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
Syria 0
and 0
Yemen, 0
with 0
millions 1
uprooted 1
and 1
homeless. 1

Yet, 0
still, 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment 0
has 0
not 0
repudiated 0
the 0
mindset 0
that 0
produced 0
this. 0

With 0
the 0
Cold 0
War 0
over 0
for 0
a 0
quarter 0
of 0
a 0
century, 0
what 0
is 0
the 0
case 0
now 0
for 0
America, 0
$20 0
trillion 0
in 0
debt, 0
going 0
abroad 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
monsters 1
to 0
destroy? 1

Consider. 0

Bush-Obama 0
"open 0
borders" 0
brought 0
in 0
tens 0
of 0
millions 0
of 0
Third 0
World 0
peoples, 0
legally 0
and 0
illegally, 0
to 0
rising 0
resistance 0
from 0
Americans 1
forced 0
to 0
bear 0
the 0
economic 0
and 0
social 0
costs. 0

What 0
was 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment's 0
reply 0
to 0
the 0
opposition 0
to 0
amnesty 0
for 0
illegals 0
and 0
calls 0
for 0
a 0
moratorium 0
on 0
legal 0
immigration, 0
to 0
assimilate 0
the 0
tens 0
of 0
millions 0
already 0
here? 0

To 0
call 0
them 0
nativists 1
and 0
parade 1
their 0
moral 0
superiority. 1

Flake 0
and 0
Corker 0
are 0
being 0
beatified 0
by 0
the 0
Beltway 0
elites, 0
and 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
John 0
McCain 0
celebrated 0
for 0
their 0
denunciations 0
of 0
Trumpism. 1

Yet 0
no 1
two 1
people 1
are 1
more 1
responsible 1
for 0
the 0
blunders 1
of 0
the 0
post-Cold 0
War 0
era 0
than 0
McCain 0
and 0
Bush. 0

About 1
which 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
wars 1
were 1
they 1
right? 1

Yesterday's 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
recognized 0
Trump's 0
triumph: 1

"Despite 0
the 0
fervor 0
of 0
President 0
Trump's 0
Republican 0
opponents, 0
the 0
president's 0
brand 0
of 0
hard-edged 1
nationalism—with 0
its 0
gut-level 1
cultural 0
appeals 0
and 0
hard 0
lines 0
on 0
trade 0
and 0
immigration—is 0
taking 0
root 0
within 0
his 0
adopted 0
party." 0

Moreover, 0
a 0
new 0
question 0
arises: 0

Can 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment 0
believe 0
that 0
if 0
Trump 0
falls, 0
or 0
they 0
bring 0
him 0
down, 0
they 0
will 0
inherit 0
the 0
estate 0
and 0
be 0
welcomed 0
home 0
like 0
the 0
Prodigal 1
Son? 1

Do 1
they 1
believe 1
their 1
old 1
agenda 1
of 1
open 1
borders, 1
amnesty, 1
free 1
trade 1
globalism 1
and 1
democracy-crusading 1
can 1
become 1
America's 1
agenda 1
again? 1

Trumpism 1
is 0
not 0
a 0
detour, 0
after 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
all 0
get 0
back 0
on 0
the 0
interstate 0
to 0
the 0
New 0
World 0
Order. 0

For 0
though 0
unpleasant, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
unfair 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
one 0
desire 0
common 0
to 0
Bernie 0
Sanders, 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
and 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
voters, 0
it 0
was 0
be 0
rid 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
resting 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
us. 0

Should 1
Trump 1
fall, 1
and 1
a 1
restored 1
establishment 1
attempt 1
to 1
reimpose 1
the 1
old 1
policies, 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
truly 1
uncivil 1
war 1
in 1
this 1
country. 1

After 1

The 0
United 0

passed 0
several 0
resolutions 0
last 0

that 0
called 0

following 0
all 0
the 0
debate 0
about 0

that 1

Part 0
of 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

that 0
they 0

while 0
claiming 0

it 0

this 0

consistent 1

anyone's 0
guess. 0

I 0
think 0
they 0
throw 0
that 0
language 0
in 0
to 0
cover 0
for 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
attacking 0
it 0
head 0
on 0
and 0
attacking 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
people. 1

How 0
does 0
any 0
of 0
this 0
stop 0
gun 0
violence? 0

It 0
doesn't. 0

What 0
it 0
does 0
do 0
is 0
infringe 0
on 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
teachers, 0
law-abiding 1
citizens 1
who 0
want 0
to 0
purchase 0
several 0
guns 0
which 0
they 0
will 0
use 0
lawfully, 0
sides 0
with 0
criminals 0
against 0
law-abiding 1
citizens 1
as 0
it 0
opposes 0
stand 0
your 0
ground 0
and 0
other 0
measures 0
written 0
specifically 0
to 0
protect 0
people 0
who 0
would 0
normally 0
be 0
victims 0
of 0
crime. 0

Banning 0
semi-automatic 0
weapons 0
doesn't 0
stop 0
crime 0
either, 0
as 0
we've 0
pointed 0
out 0
before, 0
and 0
the 0
statistics 0
are 0
available 0
for 0
anyone 0
to 0
see 0
that 0
gun 0
violence 0
didn't 0
go 0
down 0
one 0
bit 0
during 0
the 0
decade 0
of 0
the 0
Clinton/Feinstein 0
assault 0
weapons 0
ban. 0

These 0
geniuses 1
also 0
"Support 0

Again, 0
this 0
will 0
do 0
nothing 0
to 0
stop 0
criminals 0
with 0
guns. 0

Why? 0

Because 0
they 0
won't 0
follow 0
your 0
unconstitutional 1
and 1
unlawful 1
laws 1
in 0
the 0
first 0
place! 0

On 0
top 0
of 0
that, 0
the 0
criminal 0
mayors 0
want 0
to 0
institute 0
red 0
flag 0
laws. 0

"The 0
U.S. 0
Conference 0
of 0

registers 0
its 0
strong 0
support 0

extreme 0
risk 0

urges 0
both 0
states 0
and 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
to 0
enact 0
such 0
laws," 0
the 0
group 0
wrote. 0

They 0
are 0
fully 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
violating 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
of 0
otherwise 0
law-abiding 1
citizens 1
based 0
on 0
merely 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
someone 0
claims 0
that 0
a 0
family 0
member 0
is 0
a 0

to 0
themselves 0
or 0
others, 0
even 0
though 0
they 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
Trump, 0
"Take 1
the 1

first 1
and 1
then 1
due 1
process" 1
mantra. 0

Guns.com 0
reported 0
on 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
statements 0
made 0
by 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
mayors. 0

Karen 0
Freeman-Wilson, 0
mayor 0
of 0
Gary, 0
Indiana 0
and 0
chairwoman 0
of 0
the 0
conference’s 0
criminal 0
and 0
social 0
justice 0
committee, 0
said 0
gun-related 0
tragedies 0
“rips 0
families 0
and 0
communities 0
apart.” 0
“Policies 0
like 0
background 0
checks 0
on 0
all 0
gun 0
sales 0
and 0
Red 0
Flag 0
Laws 0
save 0
lives. 0

It’s 0
as 0
simple 0
as 0
that,” 0
Freeman-Wilson 0
said. 0

“The 0
U.S. 0
Conference 0
of 0
Mayors 0
will 0
continue 0
doing 0
everything 0
in 0
our 0
power 0
to 0
keep 0
our 1
communities 0
safe 0
so 0
that 0
children 0
and 0
families 0
are 0
able 0
to 0
live 0
free 0
of 0
the 0
fear 0
of 0
being 0
gunned 0
down.” 0
St. 0
Louis 0
Mayor 0
Lyda 0
Krewson 0
said 0
the 0
new 0
resolutions 0
show 0
mayors 0
will 0
“lead 0
the 0
way 0
in 0
solving 0
our 1
gun 0
violence 0
crisis.” 0
“We 1
wouldn’t 1
be 1
doing 1
our 1
jobs 1
as 1
mayors 1
if 1
we 1
weren’t 1
focusing 1
on 1
gun 1
violence 1
— 0
an 0
issue 0
that 0
threatens 0
the 0
public 0
safety 0
of 0
every 0
community, 0
big 0
and 0
small,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“Our 0
bipartisan 0
network 0
of 0
mayors 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
work 0
together 0
and 0
compromise 0
on 0
policies 0
that 0
save 0
lives. 0

If 0
only 0
our 0
partners 0
in 0
Congress 0
did 0
the 0
same.” 0
Gun 0
control 0
groups, 0
including 0
Everytown 0
for 0
Gun 0
Safety 0
and 0
Mayors 0
Against 0
Illegal 0
Guns, 0
praised 0
the 0
conference 0
for 0
reaffirming 0
its 0
support 0
for 0
stricter 0
regulations. 0

“Mayors 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
frontlines 0
of 0
America’s 0
gun 1
violence 1
crisis, 1
so 0
it’s 0
no 0
surprise 0
they’re 0
also 0
leading 0
the 0
charge 0
to 0
pass 0
common-sense, 0
life-saving 0
laws,” 0
said 0
Everytown 0
president 0
John 0
Feinblatt. 0

“It’s 0
time 0
for 0
our 1
leaders 0
in 0
Washington 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
lead 0
of 0
America’s 1
mayors 0
and 0
put 0
public 0
safety 0
over 0
NRA 0
priorities.” 0

None 0
of 0
these 0
statements 0
can 0
be 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
facts. 0

The 0
facts 0
refute 0
their 0
arguments, 0
but 0
beyond 0
that, 0
the 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
recognizes 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
keep 1
and 1
bear 1
arms 1
is 1
a 1
right 1
given 1
to 1
us 1
by 1
our 1
Creator, 1
not 1
a 1
permission 1
we 1
gain 1
from 1
government. 1

So, 0
while 0
they 0
tell 0
you 0
they 0
support 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
and 0
that 0
their 0
unlawful 1
policies 1
are 0
consistent 1
with 0
it, 0
nothing 1
could 1
be 1
further 1
from 1
the 1
truth. 1

If 0
you 0
buy 0
into 0
this, 0
you 0
probably 0
think 0
places 0
like 0
Chicago, 0
Illinois 0
are 0
among 0
the 0
safest 0
places 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
when 0
the 0
opposite 0
is 0
true. 0

Kristian 0
Saucier, 0
who 0
served 0
a 0
year 0
in 0
federal 0
prison 0
for 0
taking 0
photos 0
of 0
classified 0
sections 0
of 0

on 0

he 0
worked, 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
subject 0
to 0
unequal 0

Saucier 0
said 0
that 0
he 0

in 0
taking 0
the 0

only 0
to 0
his 0

to 0
show 0
them 0
where 0
he 0
worked. 0

He 0
has 0
also 0
lashed 0
out 0
at 0
Obama 0

that 0

According 0
to 0

Saucier 0
argues 0
that 0
the 0
same 0
officials 0
who 0
sought 0
out 0
punishment 0
to 0
Saucier 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
chose 0
to 0
be 0
lenient 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
in 0
her 0
use 0
of 0
a 0
private 0
email 0

and 0
mishandling 0
of 0
classified 0
information. 0

Saucier’s 0
lawyer, 0
Ronald 0
Daigle, 0
told 0
Fox 0

on 0
Monday 0
that 0
the 0
lawsuit, 0
which 0
he 0
expects 0
to 0

will 0

James 0

Saucier, 0

“They 0

to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
others 0
included 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
December. 0

There 0
is 0
usually 0
a 0
six-month 0
period 0
that 0
must 0
elapse 0
before 0
the 0

“My 0

something 0

by 0

he 0
said. 0

“They 1
used 1
me 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
because 1
of 1
[the 1
backlash 1
over] 1
Hillary 1

he 0
continued, 0
alleging 0
his 0
life 0
was 0
ruined 0
for 0
political 0
reasons. 0

“With 0
a 0
pardon, 0
there’s 0
no 0
magic 0
wand 0
that 0
gets 0
waved 0
and 0
makes 0
everything 0
right,” 0
Saucier 0
said, 0
“But 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
stay 0
positive 0
and 0
look 0

Saucier 0
has 0
had 0
cars 0
repossessed 0
and 0
is 0
in 0
debt 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
loss 0

a 0
felony 0

And 0
the 1
number 1
of 1
cases 1
is 1
growing 1
by 1
the 1
day, 1
said 0
Elhadj 0
As 0
Sy, 0
the 0

general 0
of 0
the 0
International 0
Federation 0
of 0
Red 0
Cross 0
and 0
Red 0
Crescent 0
Societies 0
(IFRC) 0
as 0
the 0
nation 0
put 0
all 0
hospitals 0
on 0
high 1
alert. 1

The 0
hospitals 0

also 0
begun 0
implementing 0
preventative 0
measures 0
with 0
attempts 0
to 0
stall 0
the 0

of 0
the 0
bacterial 0
infection. 0

The 0

it’s 0
introducing 0

“safe 1

dignified” 1
burial 0
methods 0
used 0
in 0
West 0
Africa 0
during 0
the 0
2014 0
Ebola 0
epidemic. 0

This 0
helps 0
cut 0
the 0
chain 0
of 0
transmission 0
by 0
preventing 0
further 0
infections 0
through 0
direct 0
contact 0
with 0
infected 0
corpses. 0

Last 0
week, 0
less 0
than 0
60 0
people 0
had 0
died 0
and 0
around 0
600 0
had 0
been 0
infected. 0

Now, 0
there 0
are 0
911 0
confirmed 0
cases 0
in 0
addition 0
to 0
the 0
almost 0
100 0
deaths. 0

While 0
cases 0
of 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
occur 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
nearly 0
every 0
year, 0
the 0
much 0
more 0
dangerous 0
and 0
deadly 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
so 0
prevalent. 0

It 0
arrived 0
earlier 0
than 0
expected 0
this 0
year, 0
and 0
has 0
become 0
much 0
more 0
contagious 0
with 0
it 0
being 0
transmitted 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person 0
through 0
the 0
air. 0

Pneumonic 0
plague 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
life-threatening 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
infection 0
caused 0
by 0
the 0
manifestation 0
of 0
a 0
Yersinia 0
pestis 0
bacterial 0
infection. 0

Although 0
the 0
black 0
plague 0
can 0
be 0
treated 0
effectively 0
with 0
antibiotics, 0
the 0
incubation 0
time 0
of 0
this 0
bacteria 0
is 0
incredibly 1
short. 0

Death 0
often 0
occurs 0
within 0
12-24 0
hours 0
of 0
becoming 0
infected. 0

The 0
bubonic 0
strain 0
of 0
the 0
disease 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
bites 0
of 0
infected 0
fleas, 0
whereas 0
the 0
more 0
contagious 0
and 0
deadly 0
pneumonic 0
type 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
coughing 0
or 0
sneezing 0
of 0
an 0
infected 0
person. 0

Elhadj 0
As 0
Sy 0
said 0
that 0
overcoming 0
the 0
epidemic 0
would 0
require 0
long-term 0
help, 0
not 0
“just 0
intervening 0
at 0
the 0
peak 0
and 0
then 0
forgetting 0
about 0
it”. 0

Dr. 0
Manitra 0
Rakotoarivony, 0
Madagascar’s 0
director 0
of 0
health 0
promotion, 0
said: 0
“Normally, 0
people 0
who 0
catch 0
the 0
plague 0
live 0
in 0
poor 0
areas, 0
but 0
people 1
in 1
every 1

and 0
groped 0
her 0
over 0
her 0
clothes, 0
grinding 0
his 0
body 0
against 0
hers 0
and 0
clumsily 0
attempting 0
to 0
pull 0
off 0
her 0
one-piece 0
bathing 0
suit 0
and 0
the 0
clothing 0
she 0
wore 0
over 0
it. 0

When 0
she 0
tried 0
to 0
scream, 0
she 0
said, 0
he 0
put 0
his 0
hand 0
over 0
her 0
mouth. 0

“I 0
thought 0
he 0
might 0
inadvertently 0
kill 0
me,” 0
said 0
Ford, 0
now 0
a 0
51-year-old 0
research 0
psychologist 0
in 0
northern 0
California. 0

“He 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
attack 0
me 0
and 0
remove 0
my 0
clothing.” 0
Ford 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
escape 0
when 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
friend 0
and 0
classmate 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Preparatory 0
School, 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
jumped 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
them, 0
sending 0
all 0
three 0
tumbling. 0

She 0
said 0
she 0
ran 0
from 0
the 0
room, 0
briefly 0
locked 0
herself 0
in 0
a 0
bathroom 0
and 0
then 0
fled 0
the 0
house. 0

Do 0
not 0
count 0
me 0
among 0
those 0
who 0
would 0
minimize 0
this 0
alleged 0
assault. 0

I 0
went 0
to 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
that 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
its 0
share 0
of 0
drunken 0
parties, 0
and 0
my 0
classmates 0
could 0
do 0
crazy 0
and 0
stupid 0
things, 0
but 0
an 0
act 0
like 0
this 0
was 0
beyond 0
the 0
pale. 0

This 0
isn’t 0
“boys 1
will 1
be 1
boys.” 1
Actions 0
have 0
consequences, 0
and 0
it’s 0
hardly 0
unjust 0
to 0
tell 0
a 0
person 0
that 0
if 0
he 0
mistreated 0
another 0
human 0
being 0
like 0
this 0
— 0
even 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago 0
— 0
he 0
has 0
to 0
remain 0
“merely” 0
a 0
judge 0
on 0
the 0
D.C. 0

Circuit 0
Court 0
of 0
Appeals. 0

Since 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
denied 0
the 0
story, 0
however, 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
whether 0
the 0
event 0
is 0
so 0
egregious 0
that 0
it 0
should 0
disqualify 0
him 0
is 0
moot. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
if 0
the 0
attack 0
happened, 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
disqualified 0
for 0
lying. 0

Yet 0
unless 0
all 0
parties 0
start 0
telling 0
the 0
same 0
story, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
to 0
know 0
for 0
certain 0
if 0
this 0
event 0
occurred. 0

We 0
don’t 0
need 0
certainty, 0
however, 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
decision 0
on 0
whether 0
a 0
man 0
should 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

I 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
standard 0
for 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
I 0
did 0
for 0
Roy 0
Moore, 0
for 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
for 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
— 0
or 0
for 0
any 0
other 0
politician 0
who’s 0
accused 0
of 0
misconduct. 0

Is 0
it 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
the 0
allegation 0
is 0
true? 0

Given 0
the 0
totality 0
of 0
the 0
evidence, 0
I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
committed 0
rape 0
and 0
sexual 0
harassment. 0

I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
has 0
committed 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
Roy 0
Moore 0
engaged 0
in 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
with 0
underage 0
girls. 0

But 0
the 0
evidence 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
falls 0
far 0
short 0
of 0
the 0
evidence 0
arrayed 0
against 0
each 0
of 0
these 0
men. 0

So 0
far 0
at 0
least 0
it 1
falls 1
far 1
short 1
of 1
the 1
evidence 1
against 1
virtually 1
any 1
other 1
politician 1
or 1
celebrity 1
who 1
has 1
faced 1
consequences 1
during 0
this 0
#MeToo 0
moment. 0

Here’s 0
why: 0

First, 0
one 0
way 0
to 0
help 0
test 0
the 0
veracity 0
of 0
old 0
claims 0
is 0
to 0
ask 0
whether 0
there 0
is 0
any 0
contemporaneous 0
corroboration. 0

Did 0
the 0
accuser 0
tell 0
a 0
friend 0
or 0
family 0
member 0
or 0
anyone 0
about 0
the 0
alleged 0
assault 0
when 0
it 0
occurred? 0

With 0
Clinton, 0
Trump, 0
Moore, 0
and 0
many 0
other 0
politicians 0
and 0
celebrities, 0
there 0
was 0
ample 0
contemporaneous 0
corroboration. 0

Here, 0
there 0
was 0
not. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
“Ford 0
said 0
she 0
told 0
no 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
any 0
detail 0
until 0
2012, 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
couples 0
therapy 0
with 0
her 0
husband.” 0

That’s 0
almost 0
three 0
decades 0
of 0
silence 0
— 0
three 0
decades 0
when 0
memories 0
can 0
grow 0
cloudy 0
and 0
recollections 0
can 0
change. 0

But 0
even 0
the 0
allegedly 0
corroborating 0
notes 0
of 0
the 0
therapist 0
raise 0
a 0
separate 0
problem. 0

They 0
actually 0
contradict 0
her 0
story 0
on 0
a 0
key 0
detail. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Post, 0
“The 0
notes 0
say 0
four 0
boys 0
were 0
involved, 0
a 0
discrepancy 0
that 0
Ford 0
says 0
was 0
an 0
error 0
on 0
the 0
therapist’s 0
part. 0

Ford 0
said 0
there 0
were 0
four 0
boys 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
but 0
only 0
two 0
in 0
the 0
room.” 0
Nor 0
do 0
the 0
notes 0
mention 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
name, 0
even 0
though 0
her 0
husband 0
says 0
Ford 0
named 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
sessions. 0

Those 0
are 0
important 0
discrepancies, 0
and 1
if 1
six 1
years 1
ago 1
she 1
told 1
the 1
therapist 1
four 1
men 1
and 1
says 1
two 1
men 1
now, 1
that 1
suggests 1
that 1
her 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
may 1
be 1
suspect. 1

As 0
a 0
former 0
trial 0
lawyer, 0
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
while 1
neither 1
notes 1
nor 1
memories 1
are 1
infallible, 1
in 1
a 1
contest 1
between 1
contemporaneous 1
notes 1
and 1
later 1
verbal 1
testimony 1
about 1
those 1
notes, 1
the 1
content 1
of 1
the 1
written 1
notes 1
usually 1
prevails. 1

Juries 0
are 0
extremely 1
skeptical 1
of 0
witnesses 0
who 0
contradict 0
written 0
notes 0
— 0
after 0
all, 0
the 0
notes 0
are 0
taken 0
when 0
the 0
words 0
are 0
immediate 0
and 0
there 0
isn’t 0
the 0
overwhelming 0
pressure 0
of 0
a 0
trial 0
to 0
conform 0
your 0
testimony 0
to 0
the 0
desired 0
outcome. 0

At 0
least 0
the 0
investigation 0
seems 0
somewhat 0
manageable. 0

If 0
there 0
were 0
only 0
four 0
boys 0
there, 0
who 0
were 0
the 0
other 0
two? 0

Let’s 0
hear 0
from 0
them. 0

In 0
fact, 0
investigators 0
should 0
interview 0
everyone 0
else 0
at 0
the 0
party. 0

Yet 0
given 0
all 0
the 0
years 0
that 0
have 0
passed, 0
would 0
it 0
be 0
possible 0
to 0
find 0
anyone 0
who 0
remembers 0
being 0
at 0
that 0
party? 0

Would 0
they 0
remember 0
any 0
details 0
at 0
all? 0

If 0
someone 0
saw 0
Kavanaugh 0
stumbling 1
drunk 1
at 0
the 0
party, 0
that 0
would 0
obviously 0
bolster 0
Ford’s 0
account. 0

If 0
another 0
attendee 0
says, 0
“He 0
was 0
totally 0
sober 0
and 0
with 0
me 0
the 0
whole 0
time,” 0
that 0
helps 0
Kavanaugh. 0

But 0
the 0
odds 0
of 0
getting 0
details 0
that 0
precise 0
are 0
long 0
indeed, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
chance 0
that 0
a 0
motivated 0
classmate 0
might 0
lie 0
— 0
for 0
either 0
person…. 0

Trump’s 0
Plan 0
for 0
Iran: 0
Put 0
Terrorists 0
in 0
Charge? 0

Back 0
in 0
the 0
2008 0
presidential 0
race, 0
I 0
explained 0
to 0
then-candidate 0
Rudy 0
Giuliani 0
the 0
concept 0
of 0
“blowback.” 0
Years 0
of 0
US 0
meddling 0
and 0
military 0
occupation 0
of 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
motivated 0

group 0
of 0
terrorists 0
to 0
carry 0
out 0
attacks 0
against 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
on 0
9/11. 0

They 0
didn’t 0
do 0
it 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
so 0
rich 0
and 0
so 0
free, 0
as 0
the 0
neocons 0
would 0
have 0
us 0
believe. 0

They 0
came 0
over 0
here 0
because 0
we 0
had 0
been 0
killing 0
Muslims 0
“over 0
there” 0
for 0
decades. 0

How 0
do 0
we 0
know 0
this? 0

Well, 0
they 0
told 0
us. 0

Osama 0
bin 0
Laden 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
why 0
al-Qaeda 0
sought 0
to 0
attack 0
the 0
US. 0

They 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
US 0
taking 0
sides 0
in 0
the 0
Israel-Palestine 0
conflict 0
and 0
they 0
didn’t 0
like 0
US 0
troops 0
on 0
their 0
holy 0
land. 0

Why 0
believe 0
a 0
terrorist, 0
some 0
responded. 0

As 0
I 0
explained 0
to 0
Giuliani 0
ten 0
years 0
ago, 0
the 0
concept 0
of 0
“blowback” 0
is 0
well-known 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
intelligence 0
community 0
and 0
particularly 0
by 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Unfortunately, 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
Giuliani 0
never 0
really 0
understood 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
tell 0
him. 0

Like 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0

he 0
either 0
doesn’t 0
get 0
it 0
or 0
doesn’t 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
it. 0

In 0
a 0
recent 0
speech 0
to 0
the 0
MeK 0
– 0
a 0
violent 1
Islamist-Marxist 0
cult 0
that 0
spent 0
two 0
decades 0
on 0
the 0
US 0
terror 0
watch 0
list 0
– 0
Giuliani 0
promised 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
had 0
made 0
“regime 0
change” 0
a 0
priority 0
for 0
Iran. 0

He 0
even 0
told 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
that 0
organization 0
– 0
an 0
organization 0
that 0
has 0
killed 1
dozens 1
of 1
Americans 1
– 0
that 0
Trump 0
would 0
put 0
them 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
Iran! 0

Giuliani 0
shares 0
with 0
numerous 0
other 0
neocons 0
like 0
John 0
Bolton 0
a 0
strong 0
relationship 0
with 0
this 0
group. 0

In 0
fact, 0
both 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Bolton 0
have 0
been 0
on 0
the 0
payroll 0
of 0
the 0
MeK 0
and 0
have 0
received 0
tens 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
dollars 0
to 0
speak 0
to 0
their 0
followers. 0

This 0
is 0
another 0
example 0
of 0
how 0
foreign 0
lobbies 0
and 0
special 0
interest 0
groups 0
maintain 0
an 0
iron 0
grip 0
on 0
our 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Does 1
anyone 1
really 1
think 1
Iran 1
will 1
be 1
better 1
off 1
if 1
Trump 1
puts 1
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
“former” 1
terrorists 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
country? 1

How 1
did 1
that 1
work 1
in 1
Libya? 1

It’s 0
easy 0
to 0
dismiss 0
the 0
bombastic 0
Giuliani 0
as 0
he 0
speaks 0
to 0
his 0
financial 0
benefactors 0
in 0
the 0
MeK. 0

Unfortunately, 0
however, 0
Giuliani’s 0
claims 0
were 0
confirmed 0
late 0
last 0
week, 0
when 0
the 0
Washington 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
published 0
a 0
three-page 0
policy 0
paper 0
being 0
circulated 0
among 0
National 0
Security 0
Council 0
officials 0
containing 0
plans 0
to 0
spark 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
Iran. 0

The 0
paper 0
suggests 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
focus 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
many 0
ethnic 0
minority 0
groups 0
to 0
spark 0
unrest 0
and 0
an 0
eventual 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
government. 0

This 0
is 0
virtually 0
the 0
same 0
road 0
map 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
has 0
followed 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
Syria, 0
and 0
so 0
on. 0

The 0
results 0
have 0
been 0
unmitigated 0
disaster 1
after 1
disaster. 1

Unleashing 0
terrorists 0
on 0
Iran 0
to 0
overthrow 0
its 0
government 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
illegal 0
and 0
immoral: 0
it’s 0
also 0
incredibly 1
stupid. 1

We 0
know 0
from 0
9/11 0
that 0
blowback 0
is 0
real, 0
even 0
if 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
the 0
neocons 0
refuse 0
to 0
understand 0
it. 0

Iran 0
does 0
not 0
threaten 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Unlike 0
Washington’s 0
Arab 0
allies 0
in 0
the 0
region, 0
Iran 0
actually 0
holds 0
reasonably 0
democratic 0
elections 0
and 0
has 0
a 0
Western-oriented, 0
educated, 0
and 0
very 0
young 0
population. 0

Why 0
not 0
open 0
up 0
to 0
Iran 0
with 0
massive 0
amounts 0
of 0
trade 0
and 0
other 0
contacts? 0

Does 0
anyone 0
(except 0
for 0
the 0
neocons) 0
really 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
better 0
to 0
unleash 0
terrorists 0
on 0
a 0
population 0
than 0
to 0
engage 0
them 0
in 0
trade 0
and 0
travel? 0

We 1
need 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
blowback 1
from 1
President 1
Trump’s 1
fully-neoconized 1
Middle 1
East 1
policy! 1

That’s 1
the 1
real 1
threat! 1

sexual 0
predation 0
and 0
that 0
Bergoglio 0
himself 0
continued 0
the 0
coverup. 0

This 0
article 0
was 0
first 0
written 0
to 0
address 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentator 0
Massimo 0
Faggioli’s 0
attempt 0
, 0
following 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
and 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
ex-Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
to 0
minimize 0
the 0
homosexual 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
blunt 0
the 0
correlative 0
rise 0
of 0
what 0
he 0
derides 0
as 0
“neo-traditionalism.” 0
As 0
my 0
piece 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
press, 0
however, 0
EWTN’s 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register 0
broke 0
the 1
explosive 1
story 1
on 0
the 0
written 0
testimony 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Viganò 0
, 0
former 0
apostolic 0
nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
(2011 0
to 0
2016). 0

Faggioli’s 0
propaganda 0
piece 0
now 0
becomes 0
merely 0
illustrative 0
of 0
the 0
points 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
here 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
this 0
astonishing 1
and 1
indeed 1
providential 1
development. 1

Regarding 0
Bergoglio, 0
Viganò 0
testifies 0
that 0
in 0
2013 0
he 0
personally 0
informed 0
him 0
about 0
McCarrick’s 0
history, 0
the 0
dossier 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
on 0
his 0
sexual 0
crimes 0
against 0
boys 0
and 0
young 0
men, 0
and 0
the 0
disciplinary 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
upon 0
him 0
by 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
(forbidding 0
residence 0
in 0
a 0
seminary, 0
public 0
appearances 0
and 0
Masses). 0

Evidently 0
already 0
aware 0
of 0
these 0
facts, 0
however, 0
Bergoglio 0
not 0
only 0
rehabilitated 0
McCarrick 0
but 0
made 0
him 0
a 0
“trusted 0
counselor” 0
who 0
advised 0
the 0
elevation 0
of 0
the 0
pro-homosexual 0
prelates 0
Blase 0
Cupich, 0
Joseph 0
Tobin 0
and 0
Kevin 0
Farrell 0
to 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
prominent 0
episcopal 0
sees 0
they 0
now 0
discredit. 0

All 0
of 0
this 0
happened 0
before 0
Bergoglio, 0
bowing 0
to 0
worldwide 0
public 0
pressure, 0
finally—only 0
weeks 0
ago—took 0
decisive 0
action 0
against 0
his 0
“trusted 1
counselor.” 1
McCarrick 0
had 0
lobbied 0
for 0
Bergoglio’s 0
election, 0
along 0
with 0
Maradiaga 0
and 0
the 1
infamous 1
Cardinal 1
Danneels, 0
who 1
covered 1
up 1
homosexual 1
rape 1
committed 1
by 1
a 1
priest 1
against 1
his 1
own 1
nephew,has 1
supported 1
“same-sex 1
marriage,” 1
and 1
advised 1
the 1
King 1
of 1
Belgium 1
to 1
sign 1
a 1
law 1
legalizing 1
abortion 1
in 1
1990. 1

As 1
Edward 1
Pentin 1
notes: 1
“all 1
3 1
prelates 1
have 1
since 1
been 1
special 1
advisors 1
of 1
Francis 1
or 1
rehabilitated 1
by 1
him.” 1

Viganò 0
concludes 0
his 0
testimony 0
by 0
declaring 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
prelates 0
involved 0
(many 0
others 0
are 0
implicated), 0
including 0
Bergoglio, 0
should 0
resign 0
their 0
offices 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

As 0
to 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
particular, 0
he 0
courageously 0
states 0
openly 0
the 0
truth 0
that 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
his 0
brethren 0
know 0
but 0
fear 0
to 0
speak 0
in 0
public: 0

I 0
want 0
to 0
recall 0
this 1
indefectible 1
truth 1
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
holiness 0
to 0
the 0
many 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
so 0
deeply 1
scandalized 1
by 1
the 1
abominable 1
and 1
sacrilegious 1
behavior 1
of 0
the 0
former 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington, 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick; 0
by 0
the 1
grave, 1
disconcerting 1
and 1
sinful 1
conduct 1
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
of 0
so 0
many 0
pastors, 0
and 0
who 0
are 0
tempted 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Church, 0
disfigured 1
by 1
so 1
many 1
ignominies. 1

At 0
the 0
Angelus 0
on 0
Sunday, 0
August 0
12, 0
2018 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
said 0
these 0
words: 0
“Everyone 1
is 1
guilty 1
for 1
the 1
good 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
done 1
and 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
... 1

If 1
we 1
do 1
not 1
oppose 1
evil, 1
we 1
tacitly 1
feed 1
it. 1

We 0
need 0
to 0
intervene 0
where 0
evil 0
is 0
spreading; 0
for 0
evil 0
spreads 0
where 0
daring 0
Christians 0
who 0
oppose 0
evil 0
with 0
good 0
are 0
lacking.” 0
[emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0
If 0
this 0
is 0
rightly 0
to 0
be 0
considered 0
a 0
serious 0
moral 0
responsibility 0
for 0
every 0
believer, 0
how 0
much 0
graver 0
is 0
it 0
for 0
the 1
Church’s 1
supreme 1
pastor, 1
who 1
in 1
the 1
case 1
of 1
McCarrick 1
not 1
only 1
did 1
not 1
oppose 1
evil 1
but 1
associated 1
himself 1
in 1
doing 1
evil 1
with 1
someone 1
he 1
knew 1
to 1
be 1
deeply 1
corrupt. 1

He 0
followed 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
someone 1
he 1
knew 1
well 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
pervert, 1
thus 0
multiplying 0
exponentially 0
with 0
his 0
supreme 0
authority 0
the 0
evil 0
done 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

And 0
how 0
many 0
other 0
evil 1
pastors 1
is 0
Francis 0
still 0
continuing 0
to 0
prop 0
up 0
in 0
their 1
active 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
Church! 1

[my 0
emphasis] 0
Francis 0
is 0
abdicating 0
the 0
mandate 0
which 0
Christ 0
gave 0
to 0
Peter 0
to 0
confirm 0
the 0
brethren. 0

Indeed, 0
by 0
his 0
action 0
he 0
has 0
divided 0
them, 0
led 0
them 0
into 0
error, 0
and 0
encouraged 1
the 1
wolves 1
to 1
continue 1
to 1
tear 1
apart 1
the 1
sheep 1
of 0
Christ’s 0
flock. 0

In 0
this 0
extremely 1
dramatic 1
moment 1
for 0
the 0
universal 0
Church, 0
he 0
must 0
acknowledge 0
his 0
mistakes 0
and, 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
the 0
proclaimed 0
principle 0
of 0
zero 0
tolerance, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
must 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
set 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
for 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops 0
who 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses 0
and 0
resign 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

[emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0

Before 0
he 0
was 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
in 0
Washington, 0
Viganò 0
headed 0
the 0
Governorate 0
of 0
Vatican 0
City 0
State 0
after 0
having 0
served 0
as 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Nigeria, 0
a 0
Delegate 0
for 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Representatives 0
of 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
and 0
a 0
Member 0
of 0
the 0
Disciplinary 0
Commission 0
of 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia. 0

In 0
those 0
capacities 0
he 0
had 0
access 0
to 0
documents 0
and 0
witnesses 0
that 0
corroborate 0
his 0
own 0
firsthand 0
testimony. 0

With 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony, 0
the 0
widespread 0
homosexual 0
infiltration 0
of 0
the 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
hierarchy, 0
from 0
the 0
top 0
on 0
down, 0
now 0
emerges 1
mountainously 1
into 1
view, 1
never 1
to 1
be 1
buried 1
again. 1

Even 0
before 0
that 0
testimony, 0
however, 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
had 0
already 0
presented 0
a 1
Sisyphean 1
task 1
to 0
neo-Catholic 1
apologists 1
for 0
the 0
decrepit 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
status 0
quo 0
and 0
the 0
ill-starred 0
Council 0
that 0
launched 0
its 0
installation. 0

Yet 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
doubt 1
they 1
will 1
continue 1
the 1
same 1
polemic 1
that 1
for 1
nearly 1
sixty 1
years 1
has 1
doggedly 1
defended 1
every 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
ruinous 1
“reforms” 1
that 1
have 1
resulted 1
in 1
a 1
debacle 1
without 1
equal 1
in 1
Church 1
history, 1
even 0
considering 0
the 0
Arian 0
crisis 0
of 0
the 0
4th 0
century. 0

Those 0
“reforms” 0
included 0
abandonment 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
strict 0
pre-conciliar 0
instruction 0
(1961) 0
that 0
“advancement 1
to 1
religious 1
vows 1
and 1
ordination 1
should 1
be 1
barred 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
afflicted 1
with 1
evil 1
tendencies 1
to 1
homosexuality 1
or 1
pederasty, 1
since 1
for 1
them 1
the 1
common 1
life 1
and 1
the 1
priestly 1
ministry 1
would 1
constitute 1
serious 1
dangers.” 1
Today, 1
neo-Catholic 1
commentators, 1
cowed 1
by 1
the 1
demands 1
of 1
political 1
correctness, 1
refuse 1
to 1
state 1
the 1
simple 1
truth 1
that 1
homosexuality 1
is 1
a 1
perversion 1
that 1
precludes 1
ordination 1
as 1
does 1
any 1
other 1
grave 1
psychological 1
disorder. 1

Kill 1
the 1
Messenger 1

I 0
suspect 0
that 0
not 0
even 0
Viganò’s 0
historic 0
testimony 0
will 0
change 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 1
position. 0

Quite 0
the 0
contrary, 0
I 0
would 0
expect 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentariat 0
either 0
to 0
ignore 0
Viganò’s 0
witness, 0
explain 0
away 0
his 0
revelations 0
or, 0
failing 0
that, 0
make 0
every 0
effort 0
to 1
smear 1
the 1
man. 1

The 0
campaign 0
to 0
discredit 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
began 0
instantaneously 0
on 0
the 0
Catholic 0
left 0
wing. 0

Only 0
hours 0
after 0
Viganò’s 0
sworn 0
testimony 0
appeared 0
online, 0
the 1
professional 1
Catholic 1
dissident 1
Sean 0
Michael 0
Winters, 0
writing 0
for 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter, 0
smeared 1
the 0
former 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
who 0
holds 0
doctorates 0
in 0
both 0
civil 0
and 0
canon 0
law, 0
as 0
“a 0
trafficker 1
in 1
conspiracy 1
theories 1
who 1
mixes 1
fact, 1
fiction 1
and 1
venom,” 1
“more 1
than 1
a 1
little 1
obsessed 1
with 1
homosexuality”—like 1
Oliver 0
Stone, 0
who 0
“was 0
obsessed 0
with 0
the 0
grassy 0
knoll”—“a 0
disgruntled 1
former 1
employee” 1
and 1
“always 1
a 1
crackpot.” 1
Without 0
addressing 0
the 0
merits, 0
Winters 0
dismissed 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
“wild 1
claims” 1
about 0
bishops 0
who 0
are 0
“subverting 0
Catholic 0
doctrine 0
on 0
homosexuality” 0
and 0
accused 0
the 0
Archbishop, 0
along 0
with 0
unnamed 0
other 0
bishops 0
and 0
archbishops, 0
of 0
“speak[ing] 0
about 0
gay 0
people 0
with 0
such 0
hatred…” 0

Winters 0
issues 0
the 0
dire 0
warning 0
that 0
“A 0
putsch 1
is 1
afoot 1
and 1
if 1
the 1
U.S. 1
bishops 1
do 1
not, 1
as 1
a 1
body, 1
stand 1
up 1
to 1
defend 1
the 1
Holy 1
Father 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
24 1
hours, 1
we 1
shall 1
be 1
slipping 1
towards 1
schism 1
long 1
before 1
the 1
bishops’ 1
meeting 0
in 0
November. 0

The 0
enemies 0
of 0
Francis 0
have 0
declared 0
war.” 0
Notice 0
that 0
for 1
Winters 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
Church 1
or 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
her 1
doctrine 1
and 1
discipline 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
defended 1
against 1
enemies, 1
but 1
only 1
Bergoglio 1
and 1
the 1
regime 1
of 1
novelty 1
he 1
is 1
leading 1
to 1
its 1
final 1
extremity. 1

John 0
Allen’s 0
instant 0
analysis 0
attempting 0
to 0
impeach 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
is, 0
as 0
one 0
would 0
expect 0
from 0
him, 0
a 0
bit 0
craftier. 0

His 0
opinion 0
is: 0
“Take 1
it 1
seriously, 1
but 1
with 1
a 1
large 1
grain 1
of 1
salt.” 1
Which 1
is 1
just 1
Allen’s 1
more 1
nuanced 1
way 1
of 1
saying: 1
“Don’t 1
believe 1
it.” 1
Allen’s 0
view 0
is 0
supported 0
by 0
such 0
irrelevancies 0
as 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Viganò’s 0
account 0
implicates 0
“no 0
fewer 0
than 0
32 0
senior 0
churchmen” 0
(so 0
what? 0

), 0
that 0
he 1
“has 1
a 1
history” 1
of 1
“innuendo 1
and 1
conspiracy 1
theories” 1
(a 0
gratuitous 0
assertion 0
unsupported 0
by 0
evidence 0
of 0
falsity), 0
that 0
he 0
allegedly 1
quashed 1
an 0
investigation 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
John 0
Nienstedt 0
and 0
ordered 0
evidence 0
destroyed 0
(an 0
allegation 0
Viganò 0
has 0
immediately 0
and 0
categorically 0
denied 0
with 0
conclusive 0
supporting 0
documents, 0
but 0
in 0
any 0
event 0
a 0
tuo 0
quoque 0
fallacy) 0
and 0
that 0
Allen 0
has 0
“the 0
impression 0
that 0
all 0
this 0
was 0
orchestrated 0
with 0
a 0
political 0
agenda 0
in 0
mind” 0
(the 0
same 0
“conspiracy 0
theory” 0
mentality 0
he 0
gratuitously 0
attributes 0
to 0
Viganò). 0

Mark 0
Shea, 0
easily 0
the 1
most 1
insufferable 1
of 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
polemicists, 1
has 0
quickly 0
followed 0
Winters 0
and 0
Allen 0
in 0
trying 0
to 0
cast 0
doubt 0
on 0
Viganò 0
’s 0
claims. 0

Ignoring 1
eleven 1
pages 1
of 1
detail, 1
written 1
and 1
published 1
under 1
oath, 1
he 1
suggests 1
there 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
“Documentation. 1

Evidence. 0

Proof.” 0
Yes, 0
Francis 0
should 0
resign 0
if 0
Viganò 0
’s 0
allegations 0
are 0
true, 0
Shea 0
admits—a 0
stunning 1
concession 1
coming 1
from 1
him. 1

Yet, 0
making 0
no 0
attempt 0
to 0
refute 0
Viganò’s 0
account 0
on 0
the 0
merits, 0
he 0
tries 0
to 0
wave 0
it 0
all 0
aside 0
with 0
his 0
usual 0
mode 0
of 0
argument—puerile 0
mockery: 1
“But 0
at 0
present, 0
the 0
eagerness 0
of 0
the 1
Greatest 1
Catholics 1
of 1
All 1
Time 1
to 0
believe 0
and 0
repeat 0
everything 0
their 1
itching 1
ears 1
want 1
to 1
hear 1
about 0
this 0
Pope 0
whose 1
living 1
guts 1
they 1
have 1
hated 1
from 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
his 1
election 1
only 0
tells 0
in 0
his 0
favor, 0
not 0
against 0
it.” 0
Shea’s 0
ever-expanding 0
opus 0
of 0
digital 0
invective 0
never 0
seems 0
to 0
rise 0
above 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
crude 0
ad 0
hominem 0
attack: 0
Well, 0
if 1
those 1
people 1
believe 1
it, 1
it 1
can’t 1
be 1
true. 1

The 1
neo-Catholic 1
propaganda 1
mill 1
will 0
have 0
a 0
very 0
difficult 0
time 0
smearing 1
this 0
witness, 0
however. 0

Speaking 0
to 0
Catholic 0
News 0
Agency, 0
Monsignor 1
Jean-François 1
Lantheaume, 1
who 1
served 1
as 1
first 1
Counsellor 1
of 1
the 1
Nunciature 1
in 1
Washington, 1
confirmed 1
that 1
“Viganò 1
said 1
the 1
truth. 1

That’s 1
all,” 1
when 0
he 0
stated 0
in 0
his 0
sworn 0

that 0
Nuncio 0
Pietro 0

another 0
setback 0
for 0
the 1
propaganda 1
machine 1
gearing 1
up 1
to 1
impeach 1
Viganò’s 1
testimony, 1
the 0
Catholic 0
Herald 0
has 0
just 0
reported 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
must 0
have 0
known 0
full 0
well 0
from 0
Viganò 0
himself 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
under 0
Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
papal 0
sanctions 0
on 0
account 0
of 0
his 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
because, 0
as 0
an 0
Archdiocesan 0
spokesman 0
now 0
confirms, 0
at 0
Viganò’s 0
request 0
as 0
then 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
Wuerl 0
had 0
to 0
cancel 0
a 0
public 0
appearance 0
by 0
McCarrick 0
not 0
long 0
before 0
Bergoglio’s 0
election. 0

The 0
Herald 0
asks 0
the 0
obvious 0
question: 0
“[I]f 1
Cardinal 1
Wuerl 1
was 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
sanctions, 1
and 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
them, 1
why 1
did 1
he 1
ask 1
no 1
questions 1
of 1
the 1
nuncio 1
regarding 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
his 1
demand?” 1
The 0
question 0
answers 0
itself, 0
and 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
on 0
this 0
critical 0
point 0
stands 0
confirmed 0
by 0
Wuerl’s 0
own 0
spokesman. 0

Bergoglio 0
Pleads 0
the 0
Fifth 0

Bergoglio 0
himself, 0
however, 0
has 0
already 0
precluded 0
any 0
attempt 0
to 0
impeach 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony. 0

During 0
the 0
return 0
flight 0
from 0
Dublin 0
after 0
the 0
“World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Familes,” 0
he 0
was 0
asked 0
to 0
comment 0
on 0
Viganò 0
’s 0
allegations 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
informed 0
Bergoglio 0
of 0
McCarrick’s 0
crimes 0
in 0
2013 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
Benedict. 0

Bergoglio 0
declined 0
to 0
incriminate 0
himself: 0

Read 0
the 0
statement 0
carefully 0
yourselves 0
and 0
make 0
your 0
own 0
judgment. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
say 0
a 0
word 0
about 0
this. 0

I 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
statement 0
speaks 0
for 0
itself, 0
and 0
you 0
all 0
have 0
sufficient 0
journalistic 0
ability 0
to 0
draw 0
conclusions. 0

It 0
is 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
trust. 0

When 0
a 0
little 0
time 0
goes 0
by, 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
drawn 0
conclusions, 0
perhaps 0
I 0
will 0
speak 0
about 0
it, 0
but 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
your 0
professional 0
maturity 0
to 0
do 0
this 0
work. 0

It 0
will 0
do 0
you 0
all 0
good, 0
really. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
as 1
Bergoglio 1
cannot 1
deny 1
the 1
allegations 1
without 1
lying, 1
he 1
will 1
say 1
nothing 1
at 1
all 1
about 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
hope 1
they 1
will 1
go 1
away—with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
sycophants 1
in 1
the 1
Vatican 1
press 1
corps 1
and 1
shifty 1
polemicists 1
like 0
Shea, 0
who 0
expects 1
his 1
readers 1
to 1
swallow 1
his 1
explanation 1
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
refusal 0
to 0
say 0
anything 0
in 0
his 0
defense 0
when 0
asked 0
point 0
blank 0
about 0
the 0
charges 0
against 0
him 0
“seems 0
to 0
me 0
to 0
obviously 0
be 0
the 0
reply 0
of 0
somebody 0
who 0
believes 0
the 0
accusations 0
are 0
groundless…”. 0

Seems 0
to 0
be. 0

Obviously. 0

While 0
events 0
have 0
overtaken 0
Faggioli’s 0
piece, 0
it 0
will 0
remain 0
useful 0
here 0
as 0
a 0
prime 0
example 0
of 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
polemic. 0

That 0
polemic 0
seeks 0
to 0
shore 0
up 0
the 0
collapsing 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
establishment 0
lest 0
it 0
give 0
way 0
to 0
the 1
dreaded 1
traditionalist 1
revival. 1

But 0
before 0
I 0
address 0
Faggioli’s 0
latest 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
indefensible, 0
some 0
background 0
is 0
in 0
order, 0
including 0
a 0
discussion 0
of 0
further 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony. 0

First 0
of 0
all, 0
as 0
I 0
predicted 0
16 0
years 0
ago, 0
because 0
the 0
Vatican 0
under 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
had 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
enforcing 0
the 0
pre-conciliar 0
ban 0
on 0
admission 0
of 0
homosexuals 0
to 0
the 0
seminary 0
“a 0
new 1
bumper 1
crop 1
of 1
homosexual 1
ordinands 1
is 0
guaranteed—and 0
with 0
it 0
a 1
new 1
harvest 1
of 1
scandal 1
for 1
the 1
Church.” 1
That 0
prediction 0
came 0
immediately 0
after 0
the 1
“pedophile 1
summit” 1
of 1
2002 1
in 1
Rome, 1
which 0
I 0
attended 0
as 0
The 0
Remnant’s 0
correspondent. 0

In 0
answer 0
to 0
my 0
question 0
then 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
Wilton 0
Gregory, 0
made 0
an 1
explosive 1
admission 1
reportedby 0
the 0
international 0
press: 0
“it 0
is 0
an 0
ongoing 0
struggle 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
Catholic 0
priesthood 0
is 0
not 0
dominated 0
by 0
homosexual 0
men.” 0
The 1
struggle, 1
to 1
the 1
extent 1
there 1
even 1
was 1
one, 1
obviously 1
has 1
been 1
lost. 1

Sixteen 0
years 0
later, 0
the 1
homosexual 1
predator 1
McCarrick 0
has 0
finally 0
been 0
exposed 0
to 0
the 0
world, 0
stripped 0
of 0
his 0
cardinal’s 0
hat 0
and 0
deprived 0
of 0
any 0
ministry, 0
but 0
only 0
after 0
international 0
media 0
coverage 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
semi-secret 0
finding 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
raped 0
a 0
teenage 0
altar 0
boy 0
47 0
years 0
ago. 0

If 0
not 0
for 0
that 0
one 0
case, 0
McCarrick’s 0
sixty 0
years 0
of 0
homosexual 1
debauchery 1
might 0
well 0
have 0
gone 0
unpunished 0
in 0
this 0
world 0
and 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
died 0
still 0
possessed 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
phony 1
honors 1
that 0
had 0
been 0
heaped 0
upon 0
him 0
throughout 0
his 0
career 0
as 0
a 1
parasite 1
in 1
the 1
Body 1
of 1
Christ, 1
including 0
the 0
favor 0
shown 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
Bergoglio. 0

The 0
telling 0
details 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
concerning 0
Bergoglio’s 0
friendly 0
relations 0
with 0
McCarrick 0
before 0
he 0
finally 0
had 0
to 0
cut 0
him 0
loose—details 1
conveniently 1
ignored 1
by 1
Winters, 1
Allen 1
and 1
Shea—are 1
utterly 1
devastating 1
to 0
any 0
defense 0
of 0
Bergoglio. 0

This 0
would 0
explain 0
why 0
he 0
will 0
not 0
a 0
“say 0
a 0
word 0
about” 0
Viganò’s 0
charges 0
against 0
him. 0

The 0
Archbishop 0
reveals, 0
as 0
already 0
noted, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
imposed 0
sanctions 0
on 0
McCarrick 0
under 0
which 0
he 0
“was 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
seminary 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
living, 0
he 0
was 0
forbidden 0
to 0
celebrate 0
[Mass] 0
in 0
public, 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
public 0
meetings, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures, 0
to 0
travel, 0
with 0
the 0
obligation 0
of 0
dedicating 0
himself 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance.” 0
Viganò 0
further 0
reveals 0
that 0
those 0
sanctions 0
were 0
communicated 0
to 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
then 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Pietro 0
Sambi, 0
but 0
were 0
also 0
repeated 0
by 0
Viganò 0
himself 0
when 0
he 0
succeeded 0
Sambi 0
as 0
Nuncio: 0

I 0
repeated 0
them 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
at 0
my 0
first 0
meeting 0
with 0
him 0
at 0
the 0
Nunciature. 0

The 0
Cardinal, 0
muttering 1
in 1
a 1
barely 1
comprehensible 1
way, 1
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
perhaps 1
made 1
the 1
mistake 1
of 1
sleeping 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
bed 1
with 1
some 1
seminarians 1
at 1
his 1
beach 1
house, 1
but 0
he 0
said 0
this 0
as 0
if 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
importance. 0

Viganò 0
testifies 0
that 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013, 0
he 0
obtained 0
a 0
private 0
audience 0
with 0
Bergoglio 0
after 0
having 0
encountered 0
McCarrick 0
at 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
residence 0
three 0
days 0
earlier, 0
during 0
which 0
encounter 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
told 0
him 0
with 0
an 0
air 0
of 0
triumph: 0
“The 0
Pope 0
received 0
me 0
yesterday, 0
tomorrow 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
China” 0
(evidently 0
to 0
assist 0
in 0
negotiating 0
Bergoglio’s 0
planned 1
sellout 1
of 0
China’s 1
underground 1
Catholics 1
to 0
the 0
Communist 1
dictators 1
of 1
Beijing). 1

Viganò 0
wanted 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
apparently 0
been 0
relieved 0
of 0
the 0
sanctions. 0

During 0
the 0
audience 0
Bergoglio 0
queried: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
and 0
Viganò 0
replied 0
with 0
the 0
truth 0
Bergoglio 0
obviously 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
hear: 0

I 0
answered 0
him 0
with 0
complete 0
frankness 0
and, 0
if 0
you 0
want, 0
with 0
great 0
naiveté: 0
“Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
you 0
know 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick, 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
ask 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
dossier 0
this 0
thick 0
about 0
him. 0

He 0
corrupted 0
generations 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests 0
and 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
ordered 0
him 0
to 0
withdraw 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance.” 0
The 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
the 0
slightest 0
comment 0
about 0
those 0
very 1
grave 1
words 1
of 1
mine 1
and 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
any 0
expression 0
of 0
surprise 0
on 0
his 0
face, 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
known 0
the 0
matter 0
for 0
some 0
time, 0
and 0
he 0
immediately 0
changed 0
the 0
subject. 0

But 0
then, 0
what 0
was 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
purpose 0
in 0
asking 0
me 0
that 0
question: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
He 1
clearly 1
wanted 1
to 1
find 1
out 1
if 1
I 1
was 1
an 1
ally 1
of 1
McCarrick 1
or 1
not…. 1

It 0
was 0
also 0
clear 0
that, 0
from 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
election, 0
McCarrick, 0
now 0
free 0
from 0
all 0
constraints, 0
had 0
felt 0
free 0
to 0
travel 0
continuously, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures 0
and 0
interviews…. 0

He 0
[Bergoglio] 0
knew 0
from 0
at 0
least 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
[the 0
date 0
of 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
Viganò] 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
a 1
serial 1
predator. 1

Although 0
he 0
knew 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
corrupt 1
man, 1
he 0
covered 0
for 0
him 0
to 1
the 1
bitter 1
end; 1
indeed, 0
he 0
made 0
McCarrick’s 0
advice 0
his 0
own, 0
which 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
inspired 0
by 0
sound 0
intentions 0
and 0
for 0
love 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

It 0
was 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
report 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
a 0
minor, 0
again 0
on 0
the 0
basis 0
of 0
media 0
attention, 0
that 0
he 0
took 0
action 0
to 0
save 0
his 0
image 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

[all 0
emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0

Before 0
his 0
long 0
overdue 0
fall 0
McCarrick, 0
as 0
Bergoglio’s 1
“trusted 1
counselor,” 1
had 0
been 0
instrumental 0
in 0
cementing 0
into 0
place 0
the 0
homosexual-friendly 0
status 0
quo 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
episcopate 0
that 0
oppresses 0
and 0
defrauds 0
the 0
faithful. 0

It 0
was 0
McCarrick, 0
noted 0
Marco 0
Tosatti, 0
who 0
was 0
behind 0
the 0
elevation 0
of 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
to 0
the 0
key 0
position 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Chicago, 0
where 0
Cupich 0
has 0
since 0
promoted 0
the 0
homosexual 0
subversion 0
of 0
Father 0
James 0
Martin. 0

And 0
Viganò 0
now 0
confirms 0
Tosatti’s 0

“The 0
appointments 0
of 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0

That 0
is, 0
the 0
normal 0
process 0
was 0
circumvented 0
for 0
these 0
appointments. 0

Remnant 0
readers 0
may 0
recall 0
that 0
I 0
spotted 0
Cupich 0
back 0
in 0
2002, 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
the 1
obscure 1
Bishop 1
of 1
Rapid 1
City, 1
South 0
Dakota, 0
as 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
what 0
was 0
coming 0
in 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo: 0
accelerated 1
degeneration. 1

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
back 0
then, 0
with 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
Cupich 0
in 0
view: 0

Cupich 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
model 0
of 0
a 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
bishop. 0

He 1
is 1
the 1
very 1
exemplar 1
of 1
the 1
crisis 1
we 1
must 1
still 1
endure…. 1

Let 0
the 0
thing 0
die 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
excesses, 0
for 0
as 0
the 0
“little 0
synod” 0
[the 1
2002 1
“pedophile 1
summit”] 1
demonstrates, 0
the 1
men 1
who 1
control 1
this 1
establishment 1
will 1
never 1
restore 1
it 1
to 1
anything 1
resembling 1
the 1
vibrant 1
Church 1
that 1
a 1
long 1
line 1
of 1
militant, 1
uncompromising 1
Popes 1
delivered 1
into 1
their 1
hands 1
at 1
Vatican 1
II. 1

For 1
heaven’s 1
sake, 1
the 0
men 0
who 0
govern 0
the 0
Church 0
today 0
require 0
a 0
Vatican 0
summit 0
meeting 0
to 0
agonize 1
over 1
whether 0
serial 1
child 1
molesters 1
should 0
be 0
defrocked. 0

From 0
the 0
Vatican 0
on 0
down, 0
through 0
deliberate 0
decisions 0
and 0
criminal 0
neglect, 0
the 1
servitors 1
of 1
Vatican 1
II 1
have 1
laid 1
waste 1
to 0
the 0
liturgy, 0
the 0
perennial 0
clarity 0
of 0
Catholic 0
teaching, 0
the 0
Church’s 0
militant 0
opposition 0
to 0
worldly 0
thinking, 0
the 0
traditional 0
formation 0
in 0
seminaries, 0
the 0
religious 0
orders, 0
the 0
missions, 0
the 0
trust 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
priests—in 0
short, 0
the 0
very 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
Church—and 0
dare 0
to 0
call 0
it 0
a 0
renewal. 0

We 1
must 1
no 1
longer 1
subsidize 1
the 1
malpractice 1
of 1
the 1
architects 1
of 1
ruin. 1

Nor 1
must 1
we 1
join 1
the 1
neo-Catholics 1
in 1
their 1
mindless 1
applause 1
when 1
one 1
of 1
these 1
incompetents 1
attempts 1
to 1
repoint 1
a 1
brick 1
or 1
two 1
in 1
the 1
crumbling 1
façade 1
they 1
have 1
erected 1
to 1
obscure 1
the 1
Church 1
of 1
old. 1

As 0
for 0
William 1
(“nighty-night 1
baby!”) 1
Tobin, 1
after 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
arranged 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
become 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Newark, 0
Tobin, 0
another 1
episcopal 1
booster 1
of 1
Martin’s 1
pro-homosexual 1
propaganda, 1
promptly 0
sponsored 0
a 0
“gay 0
pilgrimage” 0
to 0
his 0
cathedral 0
in 0
Newark. 0

And 0
it 0
was 0
McCarrick 0
who 0
obtained 0
the 0
cardinal’s 0
hat 0
for 0
his 0
roommate 0
of 0
six 0
years, 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
whom 0
he 0
consecrated 0
a 0
bishop. 0

Farrell, 0
yet 1
another 1
promoter 1
of 1
Martin’s 1
homosexual 1
activism, 1
arranged 0
for 0
Martin 0
to 0
“welcome 0
‘gay’ 0
families” 0
at 0
the 0
“World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Families” 0
in 0
Dublin 0
from 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
just 0
returned. 0

Finally, 0
there 0
is 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
the 0
“pro-gay” 1
Robert 1
McElroy 1
as 0
Bishop 0
of 0
San 0
Diego, 0
concerning 0
which 0
Viganò 0
reveals: 0
“The 0
appointment 0
of 0
McElroy 0
in 0
San 0
Diego 0
was 0
also 0
orchestrated 0
from 0
above, 0
with 0
an 0
encrypted 0
peremptory 0
order 0
to 0
me 0
as 0
Nuncio, 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin: 0
‘Reserve 0
the 0
See 0
of 0
San 0
Diego 0
for 0
McElroy.’ 0
McElroy 0
was 0
also 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses, 0
as 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
from 0
a 0
letter 0
sent 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
Richard 0
Sipe 0
on 0
July 0
28, 0
2016.” 0
Like 0
Cupich, 0
Tobin 0
and 0
Farrell, 0
McElroy 0
is 0
an 1
avid 1
promoter 1
of 1
Martin’s 1
homosexual 1
subversion 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
calling 0
opposition 0
to 0
Martin 0
symptomatic 0
of 0
a 0
“cancer 1
of 1
vilification 1
[that] 0
is 0
seeping 0
into 0
the 0
institutional 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
church.” 0

Emboldened 0
by 0
the 0
certainty 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
face 0
no 0
discipline 0
whatsoever, 0
Martin, 0
now 0
backed 0
by 0
“Cupich, 0
Tobin, 0
Farrell 0
and 0
McElroy,” 0
as 0
Viganò 0
testifies, 0
is 0
urging 0
all 0
the 0
“gay 0
priests” 0
to 0
“come 0
out,” 0
including 0
those 0
ordained 0
since 0
the 0
useless 0
“pedophile 1
summit” 1
presided 0
over 0
by 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
McCarrick 0
as 0
the 1
classic 1
fox 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
hen 1
house. 1

But 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
also 0
lent 0
his 0
own 0
authority 0
to 0
Martin’s 0
effort 0
to 0
mainstream 0
homosexuality 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

As 0
Viganò 0
notes, 0
it 0
was 0
Bergoglio 0
who 0
made 0
Martin 0
a 0
“Consultor 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
for 0
Communications,” 0
even 0
though 0
he 0
is 0
a 1
“well-known 1
activist 1
who 1
promotes 1
the 1
LGBT 1
agenda, 1
chosen 1
to 1
corrupt 1
the 1
young 1
people 1
who 1
will 1
soon 1
gather 1
in 1
Dublin 1
for 1
the 1
World 1
Meeting 1
of 1
Families…” 1

“Father” 0
Martin 0
now 0
confidently 0
declares, 0
sixteen 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
“pedophile 1
summit,” 1
that 0
“The 1
idea 1
of 1
a 1
purge 1
of 1
gay 1
priests 1
is 1
both 1
ridiculous 1
and 1
dangerous. 1

Any 1
purge 1
would 1
empty 1
parishes 1
and 1
religious 1
orders 1
of 1
the 1
thousands 1
of 1
priests 1
and 1
bishops 1
who 1
lead 1
healthy 1
lives 1
of 1
service 1
and 1
faithful 1
lives 1
of 1
celibacy.” 1

Martin 0
thus 0
revels 1
in 1
smug 1
certitude 1
that 0
the 0
future 0
of 0
the 0
universal 0
Church 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
legions 1
of 1
intrinsically 1
disordered 1
homosexual 1
bishops 1
and 1
priests 1
and 0
their 0
homosexual 0
successors, 0
who 0
will 0
perpetuate 0
an 0
existing 0
worldwide 0
homosexual 0
network, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
absolutely 0
nothing 0
we 0
can 0
or 0
should 0
do 0
about 0
it. 0

A 0
Worldwide 0
Network 0
of 0
Corruption, 0
Beginning 0
at 0
the 0
Top 0

None 0
of 0
the 0
foregoing 0
is 0
meant 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
the 0
homosexual 0
invasion 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
hierarchy 0
is 0
confined 0
to 0
American 0
prelates 0
and 0
priests. 0

The 0
spread 0
of 0
clerical 1
sodomy 1
has 0
not 0
respected 0
national 0
boundaries 0
but 0
rather 0
extends 0
throughout 0
the 0
Church 0
under 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
a 0
Vatican 0
apparatus 0
that 0
is 0
itself 0
thoroughly 1
infested 1
with 1
homosexuals. 1

This 0
is 0
thanks 0
in 0
large 0
measure 0
to 0
Bergoglio, 0
who 0
made 0
a 1
flagrantly 1
active 1
homosexual, 1
Monsignor 0
Battista 0
Ricca, 0
“prelate 1
of 1
the 1
gay 1
lobby,” 1
no 0
less 0
than 0
head 0
of 0
his 0
papal 0
household. 0

Moreover, 0
it 0
was 0
Bergoglio’s 0
right 0
hand 0
man, 0
Cardinal 0
Maradiaga, 0
who 0
sheltered 0
his 0
friend, 0
Juan 0
José 0
Pineda, 0
auxiliary 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Tegucigalpa, 0
from 0
any 0
discipline 0
over 0
his 0
notorious 0
homosexual 0
liaisons 0
with 0
seminarians 0
in 0
that 0
diocese. 0

When 0
an 0
apostolic 0
visitation, 0
compelled 0
by 0
mounting 0
public 0
pressure, 0
confirmed 0
the 0
charges 0
against 0
Pineda, 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
resign, 0
even 0
as 0
Maradiaga 0
dismissed 0
the 0
incontestable 0
proofs 0
against 0
him 0
as 0
“slander.” 0
Viganò 0
notes 0
that 0
“the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
public 0
is 0
that 0
his 0
resignation 0
has 0
simply 0
been 0
accepted, 0
thus 0
making 0
any 0
possible 0
responsibility 0
of 0
his 0
and 0
Maradiaga 0
vanish 1
into 1
nowhere.” 1

Despite 0
the 0
fall 0
of 0
his 0
friend 0
Pineda, 0
Maradiaga 0
continues 0
todefend 0
and 0
protect 0
the 0
homosexual 0
corruption 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
seminary, 0
involving 0
incontrovertible 0
evidence 0
of 0
rampant 1
sodomy 1
among 0
the 0
seminarians 0
he 0
refuses 0
to 0
dismiss, 0
rejecting 0
all 0
the 0
evidence 0
as 0
“gossip.” 0
Concerning 0
Maradiaga, 0
who 0
is 0
also 0
mired 1
in 1
financial 1
corruption 1
for 0
which 0
he 0
offers 0
no 0
credible 0
explanation, 0
Viganò 0
provides 0
this 1
withering 1
assessment 1
of 0
the 0
man 0
and 0
his 0
relation 0
to 0
Bergoglio: 0

In 0
a 0
team 0
effort 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
[McCarrick] 0
had 0
become 0
the 1
kingmaker 1
for 0
appointments 0
in 0
the 0
Curia 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and 0
the 0
most 0
listened 0
to 0
advisor 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
for 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

This 0
is 0
how 0
one 0
explains 0
that, 0
as 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
the 0
Pope 0
replaced 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
with 0
Wuerl 0
and 0
immediately 0
appointed 0
Cupich 0
right 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
made 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

With 0
these 0
appointments 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
was 0
now 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
picture 0
in 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
bishops….. 0
By 0
now 0
the 0
faithful 0
have 0
well 0
understood 0
Maradiaga’s 0
strategy: 0
insult 0
the 0
victims 0
to 0
save 0
himself, 0
lie 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
a 1
chasm 1
of 1
abuses 1
of 1
power, 1
of 0
mismanagement 0
in 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Church 0
property, 0
and 0
of 0
financial 0
disasters 0
even 0
against 0
close 0
friends, 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Ambassador 0
of 0
Honduras 0
Alejandro 0
Valladares, 0
former 0
Dean 0
of 0
the 0
Diplomatic 0
Corps 0

The 0
Pope 0
defends 0
his 0
man, 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end, 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
done 0
in 0
Chile 0
with 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
de 0
la 0
Cruz 0
Barros, 0
whom 0
he 0
himself 0
had 0
appointed 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Osorno 0
against 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
Bishops. 0

First, 0
he 0
insulted 0
the 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

Then, 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
and 0
a 0
revolt 0
by 0
the 0
Chilean 0
victims 0
and 0
faithful, 0
did 0
he 0
recognize 0
his 0
error 0
and 0
apologize, 0
while 0
stating 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misinformed, 0
causing 0
a 0
disastrous 0
situation 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Chile, 0
but 0
continuing 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
two 0
Chilean 0
Cardinals 0
Errazuriz 0
and 0
Ezzati. 0

On 0
the 0
very 0
day 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
was 0
made 0
public, 0
Sandro 0
Magister 0
summed 0
up 0
the 0
entire 0
state 0
of 0
affairs 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
universal 0
after 0
decades 0
of 0
unrestricted 0
homosexual 0
migration 0
into 0
the 0
hierarchy, 0
to 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
has 1
contributed 1
mightily: 1
“From 1
the 1
seminaries, 1
to 1
the 1
clergy, 1
to 1
the 1
bishops, 1
to 1
the 1
cardinals, 1
homosexuals 1
are 1
present 1
at 1
all 1
levels, 1
by 1
the 1
thousand.” 1

Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
now 0
provides 0
his 0
own 0
decisive 0
summary 0
of 0
the 0
situation, 0
based 0
on 0
firsthand 0
experience 0
with 0
a 0
now 0
endemic 1
homosexual 1
corruption 1
of 0
the 0
Church: 0

Janet 1
Smith, 1
Professor 1
of 1
Moral 1
Theology 1
at 1
the 1
Sacred 1
Heart 1
Major 1
Seminary 1
in 1
Detroit, 1
recently 1
wrote: 1
“The 1
problem 1
of 1
clergy 1
abuse 1
cannot 1
be 1
resolved 1
simply 1
by 1
the 1
resignation 1
of 1
some 1
bishops, 1
and 1
even 1
less 1
so 1
by 1
bureaucratic 1
directives. 1

The 1
deeper 1
problem 1
lies 1
in 1
homosexual 1
networks 1
within 1
the 1
clergy 1
which 1
must 1
be 1
eradicated.” 1
These 0
homosexual 0
networks, 0
which 0
are 0
now 0
widespread 0
in 0
many 0
dioceses, 0
seminaries, 0
religious 0

act 0
under 0
the 0

a 0
petition 0
which 0
states: 0
“We 0
your 0
subjects 0
respectfully 0
petition 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
to 0
change 0
course 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
welfare 0
of 0
souls. 0

Failing 0
this, 0
would 0
it 0
not 0
be 0
better 0
for 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
to 0
renounce 0
the 0
Petrine 0
office 0
than 0
to 0
preside 0
over 0
what 0
threatens 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
catastrophic 1
compromise 1
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
integrity?” 0
Our 0
petition 0
was 0
of 0
course 0
dismissed 0
as 0
“ridiculous” 1
by 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
commentariat. 0

Today, 0
our 0
ridiculous 0
suggestion 0
is 0
the 0
stuff 0
of 0
mainstream 0
news. 0

From 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
perspective, 0
the 0
events 0
of 0
recent 0
days 0
present 0
a 0
terrifying 1
prospect: 1
the 0
final 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
establishment, 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
conciliar 0
aggiornamento 0
and 0
a 0
revival 0
of 0
integral 0
Tradition, 0
which 0
growing 0
numbers 0
of 0
young 0
people 0
are 0
seeking. 0

Hence 0
even 0
before 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
had 0
come 0
forward, 0
commentators 0
like 0
Faggioli 0
were 0
already 0
sounding 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
air 1
raid 1
siren. 1

Faggioli 0
fretted 1
that 0
“[t]he 0
abuse 0
scandal 0
and 0
delegitimization 0
of 0
the 0
episcopate 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
great 0
power 0
vacuum 0
in 0
the 0
Church” 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
filled 0
by 0
the 0
“neo-traditionalist 0
Catholicism 0
of 0
the 0
younger 0
generations 0
of 0
American 0
Catholics” 0
who 0
“attack 0
American 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
close 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis.” 0
Accordingly, 0
he 0
rushed 0
to 0
the 0
defense 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
and 0
his 1
corrupt 1
regime 1
against 0
“a 0
radicalization 0
of 0
religious 0
conservatism 0
in 0
the 0
neo-traditionalism 0
sense...” 0

For 1
Faggioli, 1
not 1
only 1
would 1
Bergoglio’s 1
resignation 1
be 1
unthinkable, 1
so 1
also 1
would 1
a 1
purge 1
of 1
the 1
homosexual 1
and 1
pro-homosexual 1
prelates 1
Bergoglio 1
and 1
his 1
Vatican 1
henchmen 1
have 1
systematically 1
enabled. 1

The 0
Pope, 0
he 0
argues, 0
is 0
not 0
“the 1
CEO 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
world, 1
and 0
the 0
bishops 0
as 0
its 0
managers 0
whom 0
the 0
Pope 0
can 0
simply 0
fire.” 0
No, 0
Bergoglio 0
cannot 0
“simply 0
fire” 0
bishops. 0

Except 0
whenever 0
he 0
pleases, 0
as 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
again 0
and 0
again 0
with 0
the 1
conservative 1
bishops 1
and 1
even 1
Cardinals 1
(Burke 1
and 1
Müller) 1
he 1
has 1
sacked 1
because 1
their 1
conservatism 1
offended 1
him 1
or 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
friends, 1
prompting 0
even 0
Crux 0
to 0
ask: 0
“Does 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
have 1
an 1
enemies 1
list?” 1
Then 0
again, 0
Francis 0
even 0
obtained 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
“trusted 1
counselor” 1
McCarrick 1
from 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals, 0
albeit 0
only 0
when 0
forced 0
to 0
act 0
due 0
to 0
worldwide 0
condemnation 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

So, 0
according 0
to 0
Faggioli, 0
the 1
same 1
Pope 1
who 1
sacks 1
conservative 1
bishops 1
and 1
cardinals 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
pleasure 1
and 1
has 1
just 1
removed 1
a 1
cardinal 1
from 1
the 1
College 1
of 1
Cardinals 1
in 1
an 1
unprecedented 1
disciplinary 1
act 1
under 1
fire 1
from 1
the 1
media, 1
is 1
somehow 1
powerless 1
to 1
dismiss 1
Modernist 1
bishops 1
who 1
have 1
created 1
an 1
obscene 1
“gay 1
culture” 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
and 1
replace 1
them 1
with 1
orthodox, 1
normal 1
heterosexual 1
males. 1

Francis 1
cannot 1
“simply 1
fire” 1
even 1
Cardinal 1
Wuerl, 1
who 1
covered 1
up 1
crimes 1
of 1
homosexual 1
predation 1
by 1
the 1
priests 1
he 1
transferred 1
elsewhere 1
while 1
Archbishop 1
of 1
Pittsburgh, 1
and 1
who 1
authorized 1
payment 1
of 1
$900,000 1
in 1
hush 1
money 1
to 1
bury 1
sexual 1
abuse 1
claims 1
against 1
a 1
homosexual 1
priest 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
production 1
of 1
child 1
pornography. 1

Wuerl, 0
says 0
Faggioli, 0
“faces 0
a 0
complex 0
situation: 0
on 0
the 0
one 0
hand 0
Wuerl 0
was 0
not 0
afraid 0
of 0
clashing 0
with 0
the 0
tribunal 0
over 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
which 0
wanted 0
to 0
readmit 0
a 0
priest 0
from 0
the 0
Pittsburgh 0
diocese 0
to 0
ministry… 0
while 0
in 0
other 0
cases 0
he 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
collaborated 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
some 0
cases… 0
It 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
difficult 0
position 0
also 0
because 0
Wuerl 0
became 0
a 0
symbol… 0
beyond 0
the 0
specific 0
accusations 0
against 0
him, 0
from 0
which 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
publicly 0
defend 0
himself.” 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
because 0
his 0
situation 0
is 0
“complex” 0
Wuerl, 0
unlike 0
McCarrick, 0
should 0
remain 0
a 0
cardinal 0
and 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington, 0
DC, 0
thus 0
maintaining 1
a 1
key 1
bulwark 1
against 1
the 1
“neo-traditionalist” 1
threat. 1

Yet, 0
as 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
documents, 0
Wuerl 0
assisted 0
McCarrick 0
in 0
the 0
coverup 0
of 0
his 0
crimes 0
and 0
now 0
brazenly 1
lies 1
about 1
it. 1

Here 0
too 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
sheds 1
light 1
on 1
the 1
darkness: 1

…. 0

I 0
myself 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
subject 0
[of 0
McCarrick] 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
on 0
several 0
occasions, 0
and 0
I 0
certainly 0
didn’t 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
into 0
detail 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
immediately 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
it. 0

I 0
also 0
remember 0
in 0
particular 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
draw 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
it, 0
because 0
I 0
realized 0
that 0
in 0
an 0
archdiocesan 0
publication, 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
cover 0
in 0
color, 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
announcement 0
inviting 0
young 0
men 0
who 0
thought 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
vocation 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

I 0
immediately 0
phoned 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
who 0
expressed 0
his 0
surprise 0
to 0
me, 0
telling 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
that 0
announcement 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
cancel 0
it. 0

If, 1
as 1
he 1
now 1
continues 1
to 1
state, 1
he 1
knew 1
nothing 1
of 1
the 1
abuses 1
committed 1
by 1
McCarrick 1
and 1
the 1
measures 1
taken 1
by 1
Pope 1
Benedict, 1
how 1
can 1
his 1
answer 1
be 1
explained? 1

His 0
recent 0
statements 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it, 0
even 0
though 0
at 0
first 0
he 0
cunningly 0
referred 0
to 0
compensation 0
for 0
the 0
two 0
victims, 0
are 0
absolutely 1
laughable. 1

The 0
Cardinal 0
lies 1
shamelessly 1
and 0
prevails 0
upon 0
his 0
Chancellor, 0
Monsignor 0
Antonicelli, 0
to 0
lie 0
as 0
well. 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
also 0
clearly 0
lied 0
on 0
another 0
occasion. 0

Following 0
a 0
morally 0
unacceptable 0
event 0
authorized 0
by 0
the 0
academic 0
authorities 0
of 0
Georgetown 0
University, 0
I 0
brought 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
its 0
President, 0
Dr. 0
John 0
DeGioia, 0
sending 0
him 0
two 0
subsequent 0
letters. 0

Before 0
forwarding 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
addressee, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
handle 0
things 0
properly, 0
I 0
personally 0
gave 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
with 0
an 0
accompanying 0
letter 0
I 0
had 0
written. 0

The 0
Cardinal 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it. 0

However, 1
he 1
failed 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
receipt 1
of 1
my 1
two 1
letters, 1
contrary 1
to 1
what 1
he 1
customarily 1
did. 1

I 0
subsequently 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
event 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
had 0
taken 0
place 0
for 0
seven 0
years. 0

But 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it! 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
continuous 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
transgressing 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
order, 0
also 0
allowed 0
him 0
to 0
reside 0
at 0
a 0
seminary 0
in 0
Washington 0
D.C. 0

In 0
doing 0
so, 0
he 1
put 1
other 1
seminarians 1
at 1
risk. 1

[emphasis 0
in 0
original] 0

What 0
really 0
concerns 0
Faggioli 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
think 0
like 0
him 0
is 0
not 0
Wuerl 0
and 0
his 0
“complex 0
situation,” 0
which 0
is 0
not 0
complex 0
at 0
all. 0

Rather, 0
what 0
he 0
views 0
with 0
alarm 0
as 0
an 0
“essential 0
element” 0
of 0
the 0
context 0
in 0
which 0
Wuerl 0
operates 0
is 0
that 0
“scandals 0
are 0
also 0
the 0
opportunity 0
for 0
the 0
neo-traditionalist 0
Catholicism 0
of 0
the 0
younger 0
generations 0
of 0
American 0
Catholics 0
to 0
attack 0
American 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
close 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis….” 0
Better 1
a 1
thousand 1
septuagenarian 1
Wuerls 1
in 1
their 1
lavish 1
sties 1
of 1
corruption, 1
financed 1
by 1
the 1
faithful, 1
than 1
a 1
single, 1
young 1
neo-traditionalist 1
prelate! 1

But 0
what 0
exactly 0
is 0
a 0
neo-traditionalist? 0

Quite 0
simply: 0
an 1
orthodox 1
Catholic 1
who 1
has 1
had 1
enough 1
of 1
the 1
homosexual-infested 1
regime 1
of 1
novelty 1
imposed 1
on 1
the 1
Church 1
by 1
the 1
old 1
men 1
of 1
the 1
Council, 1
Bergoglio 0
merely 0
being 0
the 0
latest, 0
the 0
highest 0
placed, 0
and 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
last. 0

As 1
Faggioli 1
puts 1
it: 1
“In 1
the 1
last 1
fifteen 1
years, 1
the 1
American 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
has 1
been 1
traversed 1
by 1
a 1
radicalization 1
of 1
religious 1
conservatism 1
in 1
the 1
neo-traditionalism 1
sense, 1
especially 1
in 1
the 1
younger 1
generations 1
of 1
priests 1
and 1
intellectuals. 1

They 1
interpret 1
the 1
current 1
abuse 1
crisis 1
as 1
fruit 1
of 1
the 1
mistakes 1
of 1
the 1
Council 1
itself 1
and 1
not 1
only 1
of 1
the 1
post-Council…” 1

Just 0
as 0
Faggioli 0
fears, 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
up-and-coming 0
generation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
clergy 0
and 0
laity 0
recognize 0
the 0
obvious: 0
that 0
the 0
conciliar 0
texts, 0
for 0
all 0
their 0
prolix 0
repetition 0
of 0
traditional 0
teaching, 0
opened 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
ecclesial 1
disaster. 1

Because 0
in 0
those 0
texts—above 0
all 0
Gaudium 0
et 0
Spes, 0
Dignitatis 0
Humanae, 0
Unitatis 0
Redintegratio, 0
Nostra 0
Aetate 0
and 0
Sacrosanctum 0
Concilium—the 0
Council 0
verbally 0
prostrated 0
itself 0
before 0
“the 0
modern 0
world” 0
and 0
the 0
practitioners 0
of 0
other 0
religions 0
while 0
authorizing 0
Bugnini 0
(Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
liturgical 0
Preparatory 0
Commission 0
that 0
drafted 0
what 0
would 0
become 0
Sacrosanctum 0
Concilium) 0
to 0
begin 0
demolition 1
of 1
the 1
sacred 1
liturgy 1
that 0
was 0
the 0
very 0
foundation 0
Catholic 0
of 0
orthodoxy 0
and 0
orthopraxis. 0

To 0
quote 0
Paul 0
VI, 0
then 0
in 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
his 1
conciliar 1
delirium 1
at 0
the 0
Council’s 0
close: 0

But 0
one 0
must 0
realize 0
that 0
this 0
council, 0
which 0
exposed 0
itself 0
to 0
human 0
judgment, 0
insisted 0
very 0
much 0
more 0
upon 0
this 0
pleasant 0
side 0
of 0
man, 0
rather 0
than 0
on 0
his 0
unpleasant 0
one. 0

Its 0
attitude 0
was 0
very 0
much 0
and 0
deliberately 0
optimistic. 0

A 0
wave 1
of 1
affection 1
and 1
admiration 1
flowed 1
from 1
the 1
council 1
over 1
the 1
modern 1
world 1
of 1
humanity…. 1

Instead 0
of 0
depressing 0
diagnoses, 0
encouraging 0
remedies; 0
instead 0
of 0
direful 0
prognostics, 0
messages 0
of 0
trust 0
issued 0
from 0
the 0
council 0
to 0
the 0
present-day 0
world. 0

The 0
modern 0
world’s 0
values 0
were 0
not 0
only 0
respected 0
but 0
honored, 0
its 0
efforts 0
approved, 0
its 1
aspirations 1
purified 1
and 1
blessed. 1

[emphasis 0
added] 0

Thus 1
did 1
Paul 1
describe 1
the 1
conciliar 1
“opening 1
to 1
the 1
world” 1
through 1
which 1
the 1
world 1
promptly 1
invaded 1
the 1
Church, 1
including 1
large 1
numbers 1
of 1
homosexuals 1
who 1
should 1
never 1
have 1
been 1
admitted 1
to 1
the 1
seminary. 1

In 0
sum, 0
Faggioli 0
is 0
representative 0
of 0
the 0
thinking 0
that 0
requires 0
defense 0
of 0
a 0
homosexualized 0
clergy 0
if 0
only 0
for 0
the 0
reason 0
that 0
tradition-minded 0
Catholics 0
cannot 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
take 0
their 0
place: 0
“This 0
neo-traditionalist 0
Catholicism 0
believes 0
that 0
sexual 0
abuses 0
are 0
committed 0
only 0
by 0
homosexual 0
clergy… 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
crisis 0
of 0
abuse 0
can 0
be 0
resolved 0
by 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Jacobinism 0
that 0
should 0
eliminate 0
all 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
minimally 0
engaged 0
in 0
dialogue 0
with 0
modern 0
culture, 0
and 0
replaced 0
by 0
a 1
young 1
clergy 1
marked 1
by 1
personal 1
sanctity 1
but 1
also 1
by 1
a 1
fascination 1
for 1
a 1
mythical 1
Middle 1
Ages 1
and 0
the 0
rejection 0
of 0
a 0
Church-world 0
relationship 0
based 0
on 0
a 0
principle 0
of 0
reality.” 0

Rather 0
than 0
“young 1
clergy 1
marked 1
by 1
personal 1
sanctity,” 1
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
mentality 0
Faggioli 0
exemplifies 0
prefers 0
that 0
homosexual 0
priests 0
and 0
bishops 0
be 0
kept 0
in 0
place 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
“dialogue 0
with 0
modern 0
culture.” 0
It 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
that 0
matters 0
but 0
only 0
perpetuation 0
of 0
the 0
post-conciliar 0
regime 0
of 0
novelty. 0

Any 1
abandonment 1
of 1
the 1
regime 1
must 1
be 1
viewed 1
as 1
ecclesiastical 1
treason—“Catholic 1
Jacobinism”—if 1
not 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

Faggioli 0
would 0
probably 0
be 0
more 0
inclined 0
to 0
civil 0
or 0
criminal 0
prosecution 0
of 0
“Catholic 0
Jacobins” 0
for 0
“hate 0
speech” 0
than 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
bishops 0
for 0
their 0
complicity 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
homosexual 0
rapes. 0

“Homosexuality 1
in 1
the 1
clergy 1
exists 1
and 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
addressed,” 1
Faggioli 0
fleetingly 0
acknowledges 0
toward 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
his 0
piece, 0
“but 0
the 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
cannot 0
be 0
resolved 0
by 0
making 0
homosexuals 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
the 0
scapegoat 0
of 0
a 0
scandal 0
that 0
has 0
ancient 0
roots, 0
well 0
before 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
II.” 0
And 1
how 1
does 1
the 1
Church 1
“address” 1
a 1
massive 1
infestation 1
by 1
homosexual 1
priests 1
and 1
prelates 1
without 1
removing 1
them 1
from 1
authority 1
and 1
ensuring 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
promote 1
homosexual 1
successors 1
for 1
generation 1
after 1
generation? 1

Faggioli 0
has 0
no 0
answer 0
because 0
what 1
he 1
is 1
really 1
arguing—the 1
final 1
beachhead 1
of 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
defense 1
of 1
their 1
disintegrating 1
regime—is 1
that 1
homosexuals 1
in 1
the 1
hierarchy 1
must 1
remain 1
in 1
authority 1
as 1
an 1
indispensable 1
seawall 1
against 1
a 1
“neo-traditionalist” 1
storm 1
surge. 1

Faggioli’s 1
argument 1
demonstrates 1
that 1
neo-Catholicism 1
has 1
never 1
been 1
about 1
making 1
the 1
authentic 1
Faith 1
more 1
appealing 1
to 1
a 1
“modern 1
world” 1
founded 1
precisely 1
on 1
a 1
rejection 1
of 1
the 1
Church’s 1
authority. 1

It 1
is 1
not 1
about 1
the 1
Faith 1
at 1
all. 1

Rather, 1
it 1
is 1
an 1
ideological 1
movement 1
dedicated 1
to 1
the 1
face-saving 1
defense 1
of 1
a 1
catastrophic 1
failure 1
in 1
ecclesial 1
innovation 1
that 1
has 1
corrupted 1
the 1
human 1
element 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
practically 1
every 1
department. 1

For 0
people 0
like 0
Faggioli, 0
indeed 0
for 0
the 1
tradition-hating 1
Pope 1
they 0
blindly 0
defend, 0
the 0
one 0
thing 0
to 0
be 0
feared 0
is 0
that 0
more 1
and 1
more 1
faithful 1
will 1
recognize 1
the 1
neo-Catholic 1
polemic 1
for 1
what 1
it 1
is—a 1
fraud—and 1
begin 1
demanding 1
a 1
return 1
of 1
everything 1
the 1
regime 1
of 1
novelty 1
has 1
stolen 1
from 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

That 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
a 1
growing 1
number 1
of 1
Catholics 1
are 1
now 1
doing, 1
as 1
even 1
the 1
secular 1
press 1
recognized 1
less 1
than 1
three 1
months 1
before 1
Bergoglio 1
began 1
his 1
tyrannical 1
reign. 1

In 0
this 0
respect, 0
what 0
the 0
neo-Catholics 0
are 0
defending 0
at 0
bottom 0
is 0
themselves—that 0
is, 0
the 0
reputations 0
they 0
have 0
all 0
staked 0
on 0
their 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
indefensible 0
against 0
the 0
traditionalists 0
they 0
have 0
arrogantly 0
mocked 0
and 0
marginalized 0
for 0
decades 0
only 0
to 0
see, 0
to 1
their 1
horror, 1
that 0
traditionalism 0
is 0
ever 0
more 0
vindicated 0
as 0
the 0
scandals 0
of 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
mount 1
under 1
this 1
reckless 1
Pope 1
to 1
an 1
unsustainable, 1
indeed 1
apocalyptic, 1
level. 1

A 0
return 0
to 0
integral 0
Tradition 0
is 0
the 0
threat 0
that 0
Faggioli 0
sees 0
as 0
coming 0
particularly 0
from 0
the 0
young. 0

Irony 1
of 1
ironies, 1
he 0
is 0
now 0
reduced 0
to 0
defending 0
what 0
is 0
old 0
and 0
tired 0
and 0
corrupt 0
against 0
a 0
restoration, 0
led 0
largely 0
by 0
a 1
youthful 1
vanguard, 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
ever 1
ancient 1
but 1
ever 1
new. 1

For 0
some, 0
it 0
seems, 0
no 0
price 0
is 0
too 0
great—not 0
even 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church—to 0
avoid 0
the 0
personal 0
ignominy 0
of 0
being 0
seen 0
on 0
the 0
wrong 0
side 0
of 0
history. 0

Conclusion: 0
The 0
Fatima 0
Connection 0

Long 0
before 0
the 0
arrival 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
Rome, 0
the 0
successive 0
Vatican 0
Secretaries 0
of 0
State, 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
were 0
instrumental 0
in 0
advancing 0
the 0
homosexual 0
corruption 0
of 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
establishment. 0

As 0
to 0
Bertone 0
and 0
Sodano, 0
Viganò 0
provides 0
further 0
vital 0
testimony: 0

Nuncio 0
Sambi’s 0
report 0
[on 0
McCarrick’s 0
sexual 0
abuse], 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
attachments, 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

My 0
two 0
above-mentioned 0
memos 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
and 0
May 0
25, 0
2008, 0
were 0
also 0
presumably 0
handed 0
over 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
the 0
Substitute. 0

As 0
already 0
mentioned, 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
had 0
no 0
difficulty 0
in 0
insistently 0
presenting 0
for 0
the 0
episcopate 0
candidates 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
active 1
homosexuals 1
— 0
I 0
cite 0
only 0
the 0
well-known 0
case 0
of 0
Vincenzo 0
de 0
Mauro, 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
Archbishop-Bishop 0
of 0
Vigevano 0
and 0
later 0
removed 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
undermining 0
his 0
seminarians 0
— 0
and 0
in 0
filtering 0
and 0
manipulating 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
conveyed 0
to 0
Pope 0
Benedict…. 0

Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
was 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
until 0
September 0
2006: 0
all 0
information 0
[concerning 0
McCarrick] 0
was 0
communicated 0
to 0
him. 0

In 0
November 0
2000, 0
Nunzio 0
Montalvo 0
sent 0
him 0
his 0
report, 0
passing 0
on 0
to 0
him 0
the 0
aforementioned 0
letter 0
from 0
Father 0
Boniface 0
Ramsey 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
denounced 0
the 0
serious 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

It 0
is 0
known 0
that 0
Sodano 0
tried 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
Father 0
Maciel 0
scandal 0
to 0
the 0
end. 0

He 0
even 0
removed 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
Justo 0
Mullor, 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
accomplice 0
in 0
his 0
scheme 0
to 0
cover 0
Maciel, 0
and 0
in 0
his 0
place 0
appointed 0
Sandri, 0
then-Nuncio 0
to 0
Venezuela, 0
who 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
collaborate 0
in 0
the 0
cover-up. 0

Sodano 0
even 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
issue 0
a 0
statement 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
press 0
office 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
falsehood 0
was 0
affirmed, 0
that 0
is, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
Maciel 0
case 0
should 0
be 0
considered 0
closed. 0

Benedict 0
reacted, 0
despite 0
Sodano’s 0
strenuous 0
defense, 0
and 0
Maciel 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
and 0
irrevocably 1
condemned. 1

It 0
is 0
no 0
coincidence 0
that, 0
as 0
I 0
detail 0
in 0
my 0
book 0
on 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
of 0
Fatima, 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Bertone 0
have 0
also 0
taken 0
the 0
leading 0
role 0
in 0
suppressing 0
the 0
integral 0
Secret 0
and 0
reducing 0
the 0
Message 0
of 0
Fatima 0
in 0
general 0
to 0
a 0
generic 0
prescription 0
for 0
personal 0
piety, 0
stripped 1
of 1
its 1
prophetic 1
and 1
admonitory 1
content 1
regarding 1
the 1
epochal 1
malfeasance 1
and 1
corruption 1
of 1
the 1
upper 1
hierarchy 1
to 0
which 0
they 0
belong. 0

Concerning 0
my 0
book, 0
Archbishop 0
Pietro 0
Sambi, 0
Viganò’s 0
predecessor 0
as 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Washington, 0
whom 0
Viganò’ 0
credits 0
with 0
diligently 0
reporting 0
McCarrick’s 0
crimes 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
and 0
conveying 0
Benedict’s 0
sanctions 0
to 0
McCarrick, 0
made 0
some 0
very 0
revealing 0
comments 0
during 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
Robert 0
Moynihan, 0
published 0
posthumously 0
six 0
years 0
ago 0
in 0
Inside 0
the 0
Vatican: 0

We 0
were 0
discussing 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
of 0
Fatima, 0
the 0
allegations 0
that 0
the 0
Vatican 0
has 0
not 0
published 0
the 0
entire 0
text 0
of 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
as 0
revealed 0
to 0
Sister 0
Lucia, 0
and 0
the 0
response 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
the 0
Vatican 0
secretary 0
of 0
state, 0
in 0
a 0
book 0
where 0
Bertone 0
states 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
to 0
be 0
revealed. 0

Sambi 0
said, 0
“Excuse 0
me.” 0
He 0
got 0
up, 0
went 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
room, 0
and 0
came 0
back 0
with 0
a 0
book. 0

“Here,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Do 0
you 0
know 0
this 0
book? 0

You 0
should 0
read 0
it.” 0
It 0
was 0
Christopher 0
Ferrara's 0
The 0
Secret 0
Still 0
Hidden. 0

“Wait,” 0
I 0
said. 0

“You 1
are 1
the 1
Pope’s 1
representative 1
in 1
the 1
US, 1
and 1
you 1
are 1
urging 1
me 1
to 1
read 1
a 1
book 1
that 1
questions 1
what 1
the 1
secretary 1
of 1
state 1
wrote?” 1
Sambi 0
replied, 0
“All 0
I 0
am 0
saying 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
interesting 0
things 0
worth 0
reading 0
in 0
this 0
book. 0

And 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
we 0
are 0
all 0
after 0
the 0
truth, 0
aren’t 0
we? 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
the 0
important 0
thing...” 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
indeed 0
the 0
important 0
thing. 0

And 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
our 0
situation 0
is 0
revealed 0
in 0
that 0
still-hidden 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Secret 0
to 0
whose 0
contents 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
alluded 0
during 0
his 0
pilgrimage 0
to 0
Fatima 0
in 0
2010, 0
identifying 0
elements 0
that 0
do 0
not 0
appear 0
at 0
all 0
in 0
the 0
obscure 0
vision 0
published 0
back 0
in 0
2000, 0
which 0
Sodano 0
and 0
Bertone 0
tried 0
to 0
pass 0
of 0
as 0
the 0
entirety 0
of 0
the 0
Secret 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
they 0
were 0
covering 0
up 0
homosexual 0
corruption 0
in 0
high 0
places: 0

As 0
for 0
the 0
new 0
things 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
find 0
in 0
this 0
message 0
today, 0
there 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
Pope 0
and 0
the 0
Church 0
come 0
not 0
only 0
from 0
without, 0
but 0
the 1
sufferings 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
come 0
precisely 0
from 0
within 0
the 0
Church, 0
from 0
the 0
sin 0
existing 0
within 0
the 0
Church. 0

This 0
too 0
is 0
something 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
always 0
known, 0
but 0
today 0
we 0
are 0
seeing 0
it 0
in 0
a 1
really 1
terrifying 1
way: 1
that 0
the 0
greatest 0
persecution 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
comes 0
not 0
from 0
her 0
enemies 0
without, 0
but 0
arises 0
from 0
sin 0
within 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
thus 0
has 0
a 1
deep 1
need 1
to 1
relearn 1
penance, 1
to 1
accept 1
purification, 1
to 1
learn 1
forgiveness 1
on 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
but 0
also 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
justice. 0

[emphasis 0
added] 0

I 1
believe 1
that 1
Archbishop 1
Viganò’s 1
precious 1
testimony 1
is 1
a 1
sign 1
that 1
Heaven 1
itself 1
is 1
now 1
responding 1
to 1
the 1
“need 1
for 1
justice” 1
in 1
the 1
Church. 1

Whether 0
or 0
not 0
justice 0
involves 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
the 1
most 1
wayward 1
Pope 1
in 1
Church 1
history, 1
the 0
inevitable 0
season 0
of 0
justice 0
will 0
culminate 0
in 1
the 1
triumph 1
of 1
the 1
Immaculate 1
Heart 1
of 1
Mary 1
and 0
the 0
Church’s 0
restoration. 0

This 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
final 0
victory 0
over 0
the 0
enemies 0
within 0
and 0
their 0
apologists, 0
such 0
as 0
Faggioli, 0
who, 0
in 0
typical 0
neo-Catholic 0
style, 0
imperiously 1
scoffs 1
at 0
the 0
notion 0
of 0
“a 0
young 1
clergy 1
marked 1
by 1
personal 1
sanctity 1
but 1
also 1
by 1
a 1
fascination 1
for 1
a 1
mythical 1
Middle 1
Ages” 1
and 0
busies 0
himself 0
defending 0
an 1
unsalvageable 1
mass 1
of 1
corruption 1
he 0
dares 0
to 0
describe 0
as 0
“a 0
Church-world 1
relationship 1
based 1
on 1
a 1
principle 1
of 1
reality.” 1

I 0
can 0
only 0
conclude 0
by 0
making 0
my 0
own 0
these 0
closing 0
words 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò: 0

No 1
Justice 1
for 1
Kate 1
Steinle 1

A 0
San 0
Francisco 0
jury 0
on 0
Thursday 0
found 0
Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate, 0
also 0
known 0
as 0
Juan 0
Francisco 0
Lopez 0
Sanchez, 0
not 0
guilty 0
of 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle 0
on 0
a 0
San 0
Francisco 0
pier 0
on 0
July 0
1, 0
2015. 0

The 0
jury 0
of 0
six 0
men 0
and 0
six 0
women, 0
including 1
three 1
immigrants, 1
found 0
the 0
Mexican 0
national 0
not 0
guilty 0
of 0
all 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges 0
and 0
guilty 0
only 0
of 0
felony 0
possession 0
of 0
a 0
firearm. 0

For 0
Garcia’s 0
Zarate’s 0
attorney, 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez, 0
Ralph 0
Nader’s 0
running 0
mate 0
in 0
the 0
2008 0
presidential 0
election, 0
the 0
trial 0
was 0
all 0
about 0
Donald 0
Trump. 0

“For 0
those 0
who 0
might 0
criticize 0
this 0
verdict 0
– 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
commented 0
on 0
this 0
case 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
years,” 0
Gonzalez 0
said 0
after 0
the 0
verdict, 0
“the 0
Attorney 0
General 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
the 0
President 0
and 0
Vice 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Let 0
me 0
just 0
remind 0
them, 0
they 1
are 1
themselves 1
under 1
investigation 1
by 1
a 1
special 1
prosecutor 1
in 1
Washington 1
D.C. 1
and 1
they 1
may 1
soon 1
avail 1
themselves 1
of 1
the 1
presumption 1
of 1
innocence 1
beyond 1
a 1
reasonable 1
doubt, 1
so 0
I 0
ask 0
that 0
they 0
reflect 0
on 0
that 0
before 0
they 0
comment 0
or 0
disparage 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
this 0
case.” 0

“From 0
day 0
one 0
this 0
case 0
was 0
used 0
as 0
a 0
means 1
to 1
foment 1

been 0
deported 0
five 0
times. 0

In 0

On 0

1, 0
2015, 0
the 0

picked 0
up 0

caliber 0

stolen 0
from 0
a 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Land 0

officer, 0
and 0
fired 0
the 0
shot 0
that 0
killed 0
Kate 0
Steinle, 0
only 0
32 0
years 0
old. 0

The 0
Mexican 0
nation 0
and 0
career 0
criminal 0
enjoyed 1
all 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
legal 1
system, 1
the 0
presumption 0
of 0
innocence, 0
and 0
a 0
high-profile 0
defense 0
attorney 0
funded 0
by 0
American 0
taxpayers. 0

During 0
the 0
trial, 0
former 0
vice 0
presidential 0
candidate 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
claimed 0
that 0
Garcia 1
Zarate’s 1
background 1
and 1
nationality 1
played 1
a 1
role 1
in 1
his 1
prosecution. 1

As 0
Gonzalez 0
argued, 0
“If 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
college 1
student 1
or 1
Swedish 1
kid 1
would 1
he 1
be 1
charged 1
with 1
murder?” 1

That 0
sort 0
of 0
politically 1
correct 1
nonsense 1
plays 0
well 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
so 0
any 0
observer 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
could 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
believing 0
that 0
prosecution 0
and 0
defense 0
both 0
got 0
the 0
outcome 0
they 0
wanted, 0
regardless 0
of 0
the 0
tragedy 0
for 0
the 0
Steinle 0
family. 0

The 0
felony 0
firearms 0
charge, 0
the 0
only 0
charge 0
on 0
which 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
was 0
found 0
guilty, 0
carries 0
a 0
sentence 0
of 0
16 0
months 0
to 0
3 0
years. 0

Since 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
has 0
been 0
languishing 0
in 0
jail, 0
the 0
authorities 0
could 0
commute 0
any 0
sentence 0
to 0
time 0
served 0
and 0
he 0
could 0
walk 0
free 0
within 0
weeks. 0

San 0
Francisco 0
is 0
not 0
likely 0
to 0
hand 0
the 0
felon 0
over 0
to 0
ICE 0
for 0
deportation. 0

Should 0
that 0
happen, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
has 0
already 0
proved 0
five 0
times 0
that 0
anybody 0
can 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
violating 0
U.S. 0
immigration 0
law. 0

He 1
has 1
already 1
proved 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
sanctuary 1
state 1
of 1
California, 1
false-documented 1
illegals 1
are 1
a 1
privileged 1
class. 1

Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate, 0
or 0
whatever 0
his 0
real 0
name 0
is, 0
has 0
also 0
proved 0
that 0
a 0
career 0
criminal 0
who 0
is 0
not 0
even 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
can 0
literally 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
murder 0
in 0
broad 0
daylight. 0

When 0
that 0
happens, 0
the 0
killer’s 0
public 0
defender 0
will 0
call 0
it 0
a 0
“vindication 0
for 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
immigrants.” 0

In 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
and 0
across 0
California, 0
this 0
verdict 0
will 0
surely 0
give 0
new 0
meaning 0
to 0
the 0
cry 0
of 0
“no 0
justice, 0
no 0
peace.” 0

For 0
nearly 0
two 0
millennia, 0
Jews 0
have 0
suffered 0
persecution 0
after 0
persecution 0
at 0
the 0

Recently, 0
a 0
video 0
clip 0
of 0
anti-Semitic 0
pastor 0
Steve 0
Anderson 0
– 0
making 1
the 1
claim 1
that 1
Jews 1
have 1
experienced 1
such 1
abuse 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
somehow 1
been 1

of 0
two 0
anti-crime 0

Anderson’s 0

“makes 0

of 0
sense.” 0
With 0
statements 0
like 0
this 0
from 0
Zakkout 0
and 0
worse, 0
why 0
would 0
groups 0
committed 0
to 0
fighting 0
crime 0
continue 0
to 0
compromise 0
themselves 0
and 0
sabotage 0
their 0
mission 0
by 0
affiliating 0
with 0
him? 0

Sofian 0

Zakkout 0
is 0
the 0
President 0
of 0

American 0

America 0
(AMANA), 0
a 0

Islamic 0
organization 0
headquartered 0
in 0

On 0
January 0
25th, 0
Zakkout 0
posted 0
onto 0
his 0
personal 0
Facebook 0
page 0
a 0
video 0
clip 0
of 0
a 0
speech 0
made 0
by 0
Steve 0
Anderson, 0
the 0
pastor 0
of 0
the 0
Faithful 0
Word 0
Baptist 0
Church 0
in 0
Tempe, 0
Arizona. 0

Anderson 0
is 0
notorious 0
for 0
calling 0
for 0
the 0
killing 0
of 0
gays 0
to 0
end 0
AIDS. 0

In 0
the 0
clip, 0
Anderson 0
states 0
the 0
following: 0
“And 0
the 0
Jews 0
were 0
scattered 0
into 0
all 0
nations 0
for 0
literally 0
2000 0
years, 0
right? 0

For 0
1800 0
sum 0
odd 0
years. 0

And 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
everywhere 0
they 0
were 0
scattered, 0
they 0
were 0
persecuted, 0
hated, 0
treated 0
badly. 0

Why? 0

‘Cause 0
God’s 0
blessing 0
them? 0

No. 0

‘Cause 1
they’re 1
under 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
God 1
for 1
having 1
rejected 1
the 1
Lord 1
Jesus 1
Christ.” 1

Blaming 0
Jews 0
for 0
the 0
extreme 0
torment 0
they 0
endured 0
for 0
so 0
long, 0
which 0
includes 0
a 0
Nazi 0
Holocaust 0
that 0
took 0
the 0
lives 0
of 0
six 0
million 0
innocent 0
Jews 0
and 0
so 0
many 0
others, 0
is 0
incredibly 1
offensive. 1

Indeed, 0
statements 0
and 0
beliefs 0
such 0
as 0
Anderson’s 0
have 0
provoked 0
hatred 0
and 0
persecution 0
of 0
Jews. 0

Towards 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
clip, 0
which 0
is 0
less 0
than 0
four 0
minutes 0
in 0
length, 0
Anderson 0
throws 0
the 0
anti-Semitism 0
in 0
people’s 0
faces. 0

He 0
zealously 0
states, 0
while 0
drawing 0
laughter 0
from 0
his 0
small 0
audience, 0
“You 0
say, 0
‘Why 0
are 0
you 0
preaching 0
against 0
the 0
Jews?’ 0
Well, 0
don’t 0
come 0
back 0
next 0
Wednesday 0
night. 0

Because, 0
next 0
Wednesday 0
night, 0
God’s 0
wrath 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
Jews 0
even 0
more!” 0

About 0
the 0
clip, 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
Zakkout 0
wrote 0
above 0
it, 0
“Makes 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
sense!” 0
Of 0
course, 0
this 0
is 0
coming 0
from 0
someone 0
[Zakkout] 0
who 0
regularly 0
refers 0
to 0
Jews 0
as 0
“monkeys 1
and 1
pigs,” 1
and 0
in 0
February 0
2016, 0
circulated 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
a 0
report 0
claiming 0
that 0
“the 0
Holocaust 0
was 0
faked.” 0
The 0
report 0
calls 0
the 0
Holocaust 0
“the 0
biggest 0
lie 0
ever 0
foisted 0
upon 0
humanity” 0
and 0
was 0
produced 0
by 0
a 0
media 0
outlet 0
which 0
describes 0
Hitler 0
as 0
“the 0
greatest 1
leader 1
in 1
modern 1
Western 1
history.” 1

Both 0
Anderson 0
and 0
Zakkout 0
have 0
been 0
denounced 0
by 0
the 0
Anti-Defamation 0
League 0
(ADL) 0
for 0
their 0
propagation 0
of 0
anti-Semitism. 0

In 0

the 0

condemned 0
Zakkout 0

repeatedly 0

“Satan.” 1
He 0
states, 0
“Really, 0
they’re 0

No, 0

outside 0
the 0

Rally 0
goers 0
repeatedly 0

“Let’s 1

After 0

Zakkout 0

in 0

above 0

from 0
the 0

“Thank 0

He 0
signed 0

“Br. 0

The 0

declared 0
in 0

"Hamas 0

on 0

All 0
of 0
the 0
above 0
testifies 0
to 0
hatred 0
and 0
intolerance, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
even 0
more 0

His 0

Once 0

panel 0
at 0
the 0
Education 0
Minnesota 0
Apple 0
Valley 0
open 0
to 0
union 0
members 0
and 0
guests. 0

Prior 0
to 0
the 0
event, 0
Ellison's 0
campaign 0
called 0
police 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
"protected" 0
from 0
a 0
woman 0
armed 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
camera 0
phone 0
. 0

Loomer 0
peppered 0
him 0
with 0
questions 0
about 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
at 0
a 0
State 0
Attorney 0
General 0
debate 0
Friday 0
night. 0

She 0
stood 0
alongside 0
other 0
female 0
survivors 0
of 0
abuse. 0

Ellison 0
not 0
only 0
claimed 0
the 0
women 0
were 0
lying 0
but 0
then 0
fled 0
the 0
scene. 0

At 0
least 0
he 0
said 0
something 0
there, 0
which 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
for 0
his 0
response 0
earlier 0
in 0
September 0
when 0
Loomer 0
confronted 0
him 0
at 0
another 0
event 0
with 0
questions. 0

Failing 0
to 0
answer, 0
Ellison 0
tried 0
to 0
move 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person, 0
allowing 0
his 0
minions 1
to 0
try 0
and 0
provide 0
cover 0
for 0
him, 0
similar 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
Maxine 0
Waters, 0
but 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
"member's 0
only" 0
elevator 0
to 0
flee 0
into. 0

Finally, 0
Ellison 0
fled 0
the 0
scene, 0
hounding 0
by 0
Loomer 0
and 0
others 0
questioning 0
him 0
about 0
the 0
abuse. 0

The 0
irony 0
is 0
of 0
Ellison's 0
campaign 0
calling 0
on 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
from 0
a 0
woman, 0
armed 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
camera 0
phone, 0
who 0
is 0
simply 0
asking 0
him 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
the 0
accusations 0
and 0
police 0
report, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
how 0
he 0
plans 0
on 0
being 0
attorney 0
general 0
without 0
a 0
license, 0
when 0
he 0
has 0
shown 0
his 0
support 0
for 0
those 0
that 0
murder 0
police 0
officers 0
in 0
cold 0
blood. 0

Scott 0
Johnson 0
reports 0
on 0
Ellison's 0
sordid 1
history 0
supporting 0
such 0
criminals. 0

Ellison 0
was 0
an 0
active 0
supporter 0
and 0
local 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
in 0
Minneapolis 0
before 0
his 0
election 0
to 0
Congress. 0

(I 0
set 0
forth 0
this 0
history 0
in 0
some 0
detail 0
in 0
the 0
October 0
9, 0
2006 0
issue 0
of 0
The 0
Weekly 0
Standard.) 0

Ellison 0
has 0
baldly 0
dissembled 0
about 0
this 0
history 0
since 0
2006. 0

In 0
his 0
2014 0
memoir 0
My 0
Country, 0
’Tis 0
of 0
Thee 0
,for 0
example, 0
Ellison 0
simply 0
omitted 0
it 0
and 0
presented 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
critic 0
of 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam. 0

This 0
past 0
June, 0
Ellison 0
told 0
Jake 0
Tapper 0
on 0
CNN, 0
“I 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
Million 0
Man 0
March 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
proud 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

That’s 0
it.” 0
But 0
that 0
wasn’t 0
it. 0

Ellison 0
first 0
sought 0
office 0
as 0
a 0
Democrat 0
in 0
1998 0
as 0
Keith 0
Ellison-Muhammad, 0
a 0
self-avowed 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam. 0

(Ellison-Muhammad 0
is 0
just 0
one 0
of 0
three 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
names 0
Ellison 0
has 0
used 0
over 0
the 0
years.) 0

Fortunately 0
for 0
him, 0
Ellison’s 0
5th 0
District 0
constituents 0
haven’t 0
much 0
cared 0
about 0
his 0
history 0
and 0
the 0
Minneapolis 0
Star 0
Tribune 0
has 0
almost 0
entirely 0
let 0
it 0
rest 0
exactly 0
where 0
Ellison 0
wants 0
it. 0

But 0
seeking 0
the 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
job 0
in 0
Minnesota 0
and 0
running 0
for 0
statewide 0
office 0
should 0
be 0
a 0
more 0
daunting 0
challenge 0
because 0
Ellison 0
is 0
an 0
extraordinarily 1
poor 1
fit 1
for 0
the 0
job. 0

Among 0
the 0
troubling 0
threads 0
that 0
run 0
through 0
Ellison’s 0
career: 0
support 0
for 0
cop 1
killers. 1

In 0
September 0
1992 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
officer 0
Jerry 0
Haaf 0
was 0
murdered 1
execution-style, 1
shot 0
in 0
the 0
back 0
as 0
he 0
took 0
a 0
coffee 0
break 0
at 0
a 0
restaurant 0
in 0
south 0
Minneapolis. 0

Police 0
later 0
determined 0
that 0
Haaf’s 0
murder 0
was 0
a 0
gang 0
hit 0
performed 0
by 0
four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
city’s 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
gang.The 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
was 0
Sharif 0
Willis, 0
a 0
convicted 0
murderer 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
released 0
from 0
prison 0
and 0
who 0
sought 0
respectability 0
as 0
a 0
responsible 0
gang 0
leader 0
from 0
gullible 0
municipal 0
authorities 0
while 0
operating 0
a 0
gang 0
front 0
called 0
United 0
for 0
Peace. 0

The 0
four 0
Vice 0
Lords 0
members 0
who 0
murdered 0
Haaf 0
met 0
and 0
planned 0
the 0
murder 0
at 0
Willis’s 0
house. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
two 0
witnesses 0
implicated 0
Willis 0
in 0
the 0
planning 0
he 0
was 0
never 0
charged 0
because 0
law 0
enforcement 0
authorities 0
said 0
they 0
lacked 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
convict 0
him. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Ellison 0
was 0
a 0
Minneapolis 0
attorney 0
in 0
private 0
practice. 0

And 0
within 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
Haaf’s 0
murder, 0
Ellison 0
appeared 0
with 0
Willis 0
supporting 0
the 0
United 0
for 0
Peace 0
gang 0
front. 0

In 0
October 0
1992, 0
Ellison 0
helped 0
organize 0
a 0
demonstration 0
against 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
that 0
included 0
United 0
for 0
Peace. 0

“The 0
main 0
point 0
of 0
our 0
rally 0
is 0
to 0
support 0
United 0
for 0
Peace 0
[in 0
its 0
fight 0
against] 0
the 0
campaign 0
of 0
slander 0
the 0
police 0
federation 0
has 0
been 0
waging,” 0
said 0
Ellison. 0

Willis 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
speaker 0
at 0
the 0
demonstration. 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
contemporaneous 0
report 0
in 0
the 0
St. 0
Paul 0
Pioneer 0
Press, 0
Willis 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
that 0
Minneapolis 0
police 0
were 0
experiencing 0
the 0
same 0
fear 0
from 0
young 0
black 0
men 0
that 0
blacks 0
had 0
felt 0
from 0
police 0
for 0
many 0
years. 0

“If 0
the 0
police 0
have 0
some 0
fear, 0
I 0
understand 0
that 0
fear,” 0
Willis 0
said. 0

“We 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
an 0
overabundance 0
of 0
bad 1
police. 0

. 0

. 0

. 0

[W]e’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
them,” 0
Willis 0
said. 0

“They’ve 1
got 1
to 1
go.” 1
The 0
Pioneer 0
Press 0
account 0
concludes 0
with 0
Ellison’s 0
contribution 0
to 0
the 0
demonstration: 0
“Ellison 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
that 0
the 0
police 0
union 0
is 0
systematically 0
frightening 0
whites 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
more 0
police 0

Ellison 0
publicly 0
supported 0
the 0
Haaf 0
murder 0
defendants. 0

In 0
February 0
1993, 0
he 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
demonstration 0
for 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
during 0
his 0
trial. 0

Ellison 0
led 0
the 0
crowd 0
assembled 0
at 0
the 0
courthouse 0
in 0
a 0
chant 0
that 0
was 0
ominous 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
Haaf’s 0
cold-blooded 0
murder: 0
“We 1
don’t 1
get 1
no 1
justice, 1
you 1
don’t 1
get 1
no 1
peace.” 1
Ellison’s 0
working 0
relationship 0
with 0
Sharif 0
Willis 0
finally 0
came 0
to 0
an 0
end 0
in 0
February 0
1995, 0
when 0
Willis 0
was 0
convicted 0
in 0
federal 0
court 0
on 0
several 0
counts 0
of 0
drug 0
and 0
gun-related 0
crimes 0
and 0
sent 0
back 0
to 0
prison 0
for 0
20 0
years. 0

The 0
Haaf 0
case 0
wasn’t 0
an 0
aberration 0
for 0
Ellison. 0

In 0
February 0
2000, 0
he 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
fundraiser 0
sponsored 0
by 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
chapter 0
of 0
the 0
old 0
National 0
Lawyers 0
Guild, 0
on 0
whose 0
steering 0
committee 0
he 0
had 0
served—the 0
chapter 0
was 0
raising 0
funds 0
for 0
former 0
Symbionese 0
Liberation 0
Army 0
member 0
Kathleen 0
Soliah, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
fugitive 0
from 0
justice 0
for 0
25 0
years, 0
on 0
charges 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
attempted 0
pipe 0
bombing 0
of 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
police 0
officers 0
in 0
1975. 0

(The 0

In 0
his 0
National 0

speech 0
Ellison 0
spoke 0
favorably 0
of 0
cop 1
killers 1
Mumia 0
Abu-Jamal 0
and 0
“Assata 0
Shakur” 0
(Joanne 0
Chesimard), 0
who 0
was 0
wanted 0
for 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
New 0
Jersey 0
state 0
trooper 0
Werner 0
Foerster 0
in 0
1973. 0

Chesimard 0
was 0
convicted 0
of 0
that 0
murder 0
but 0
escaped 0
from 0
prison 0
in 0
1979 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
the 0
lam 0
in 0
Cuba 0
since 0
1984. 0

Bryan 0
Burrough’s 0
Days 0
of 0
Rage 0
has 0
a 0
riveting 0
account 0
of 0
Chesimard’s 0
terrorist 0
career. 0

In 0
2013, 0
the 0
FBI 0
made 0
Chesimard 0
the 0
first 0
woman 0
named 0
to 0
its 0
Most 0
Wanted 0
Terrorists 0
List. 0

The 0
FBI 0
has 0
offered 0
a 0
reward 0
of 0
up 0
to 0
$1,000,000 0
for 0
her 0
capture. 0

Yet 0
Ellison 0
prayed 0
for 0
Chesimard 0
in 0
his 0
National 0
Lawyers 0
Guild 0
speech: 0
“I 0
am 0
praying 0
that 0
Castro 0
does 0
not 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
where 0
he 0
has 0
to 0
really 0
barter 0
with 0
these 0
guys 0
over 0
here 0
because 0
they’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
Assata 0
Shakur, 0
they’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
other 0
people,” 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
crowd. 0

“I 0
hope 0
the 0
Cuba[n] 0
people 0
can 0
stick 0
to 0
it, 0
because 0
the 0
freedom 0
of 0
some 0
good 0
decent 0
people 0
depends 0
on 0
it.” 0
Ellison’s 0
support 0
for 0
Soliah/Olson 0
in 0
the 0
speech 0
is 0
equally 0
notable. 0

He 0
denounced 0
law 0
enforcement 0
authorities 0
for 0
prosecuting 0
the 0
attempted 0
murder 0
of 0
police 0
officers. 0

Referring 0
to 0
the 0
days 0
Soliah/Olson 0
had 0
spent 0
in 0
the 0
SLA 0
under 0
the 0
leadership 0
of 0
Donald 0
DeFreeze 0
(“Field 0
Marshal 0
Cinque”), 0
Ellison 0
hailed 0
Soliah/Olson 0
as 0
a 0
“black 1
gang 1
member” 1
and 0
portrayed 0
her 0
as 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
government 0
persecution. 0

He 0
described 0
her 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
“fighting 0
for 0
freedom 0
in 0
the 0
‘60s 0
and’70s” 0
and 0
called 0
for 0
her 0
release. 0

Ellison 0
to 0
the 0
contrary 0
notwithstanding, 0
Soliah/Olson 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
the 0
crimes 0
charged 0
in 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
and 0
to 0
an 0
additional 0
murder 0
charge 0
in 0
Sacramento. 0

According 0
to 0
Ellison, 0
Soliah/Olson 0
was 0
a 0
social 0
justice 0
warrior 0
fighting 0
the 0
good 0
fight. 0

The 0
case 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
attempted 0
murder 0
of 0
police 0
officers; 0
that 0
was 0
but 0
a 0
pretext. 0

Seems 0
he 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
willing 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
shield 0
him 0
from 0
the 0
press 0
who 0
will 0
confront 0
him 0
publicly 0
while 0
taking 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
their 0
murderers 0
for 0
political 0
gain. 0

any 0
academic 0
should 0
do, 0
attempt 0
to 0
test 0
ideas 0
and 0
consider 0
alternative 0
explanations. 0

(Oddly 0
enough, 0
this 0
makes 0
it 0
rather 0
like 0
the 0
groups 0
it 0
claims 0
to 0
criticize.) 0

And 0
the 0
label 0
of 0
“violent 1
extremist” 1
turns 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
used 0
very 0
generously. 0

Ganesh 0
makes 0
wild 1
leaps 0
and 0
inferences. 0

He 0
talks 0
of 0
Darren 0
Osborne, 0
the 0
perpetrator 0
of 0
the 0
vehicular 0
attack 0
on 0
Finsbury 0
Park 0
Mosque. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
heinous 1
crime, 0
and 0
should 0
rightly 0
be 0
condemned. 0

But 0
why 0
did 0
Osborne 0
do 0
this, 0
according 0
to 0
Ganesh? 0

The 0
attack 0
“was 0
executed 0
after 0
he 0
had 0
become 0
indignant 0
after 0
watching 0
a 0
BBC 0
broadcast 0
on 0
child 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
and 0
turned 0
to 0
social 0
media 0
to 0
make 0
sense 0
of 0
it. 0

He 0
found 0
a 0
narrative 0
from 0
British 0
counter-jihad 0
groups 0
closely 0
aligned 0
with 0
the 0
alt-right, 0
such 0
as 0
Britain 0
First 0
and 0
the 0
founder 0
of 0
the 0
English 0
Defence 0
League 0
Tommy 0
Robinson.” 0
The 0
British 0
counter-jihad 0
movement 0
is 0
thus 0
swept 0
into 0
the 0
same 0
group 0
of 0
violent 1
extremists 1
as 0
Osborne, 0
because 0
Ganesh 0
“knows” 1
they 0
encouraged 0
him. 0

The 0
BBC 0
broadcast 0
was 0
the 0
drama 0
based 0
on 0
real 0
life, 0
Three 0
Girls, 0
which 0
showed 0
real-life 0
events 0
of 0
three 0
of 0
the 0
(very 0
many) 0
victims 0
of 0
the 0
Rochdale 0
Muslim 0
rape 0
gangs. 0

Ganesh 0
somehow 0
knows 0
precisely 0
what 0
went 0
on 0
in 0
Osborne’s 0
mind. 0

Rather 0
than 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
outrage 0
at 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
the 0
gangs 0
of 0
Muslim 0
men 0
of 0
Pakistani 0
background 0
who 0
abused 0
the 0
girls 0
portrayed 0
in 0
Three 0
Girls 0
that 0
caused 0
Osborne 0
to 0
lose 0
his 0
mind 0
and 0
commit 0
his 0
terrible 1
crime, 0
Ganesh 0
blames 0
Obsorne’s 0
act 0
on 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
Tommy 0
Robinson. 0

Yet 0
Robinson 0
explicitly 0
fights 0
AGAINST 1
political 0
violence. 0

What 1
“narrative 1
from 1
British 1
counter-jihad 1
groups” 1
can 1
one 1
find 1
which 1
suggests 1
driving 1
vehicles 1
into 1
innocent 1
Muslims 1
standing 1
outside 1
a 1
mosque? 1

I’m 0
sure 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
any, 0
Ganesh 0
would, 0
as 0
a 0
researcher 0
at 0
an 0
elite 0
institution, 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
it. 0

But 0
there 1
is 1
none 1
offered 1
– 0
only 0
surmise 0
and 0
Ganesh’s 0
mindreading 0
techniques. 0

I 0
suppose 0
if 0
you’re 0
paid 0
to 0
fight 0
online 0
extremism, 0
you’d 0
better 0
find 0
it, 0
or 0
you’re 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
job 0
and 0
short 0
of 0
academic 0
publication. 0

We 0
have 0
also 0
the 0
ridiculous 1
idea 0
that 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
“alt-right.” 0
He, 0
in 0
fact, 0
describes 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
centrist 0
– 0
he’s 0
said 0
he 0
agrees 0
with 0
Labour 0
on 0
some 0
things, 0
the 0
Tories 0
on 0
other 0
things, 0
and 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
EDL 0
precisely 0
because 0
he 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
infiltration 0
by 0
the 0
far 0
right. 0

He 0
shows 0
no 0
hint 0
of 0
racism 0
or 0
of 0
white 0
supremacism. 0

Why 0

Washington 0
(CNN) 0
Senate 0

the 0

of 0
secretly 0
trying 0
to 0
give 0
Tehran 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
US 0

as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0

A 0
report 0
released 0
by 0
Republican 0
senators 0
on 0
the 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigation 0
said 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
didn't 0
tell 0
Congress 0
that 0
it 0
sought 0
access 0
for 0
Iran 0
and, 0
in 0
its 0
eagerness 0
to 0
clinch 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
dodge 0
sanctions 0
that 0
remained 0
in 0
place 0
following 0
the 0
2016 0
agreement. 0

"The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
misled 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
and 0
Congress 0
because 0
they 0
were 0
desperate 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran," 0
said 0
Sen. 0

Rob 0
Portman, 0
the 0
Ohio 0
Republican 0
who 0
chairs 0
the 0
subcommittee 0
and 0
opposed 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal, 0
formally 0
known 0
as 0
the 0

Comprehensive 0
Plan 0
of 0
Action. 0

The 0
accusations 0
were 0
rejected 0
by 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
who 0
said 0
Republicans 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
one-time 0
effort 0
to 0
meet 0
obligations 0
under 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
sound 0
like 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
broad 0
access 0
to 0
the 0

They 0
said 0
the 0

Iran 0

reverberations 0

The 0
report 0
and 0
the 0
former 0
officials' 0
response 0
highlight 0
how 0
controversial 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal 0
continues 0
to 0
be, 0
even 0
after 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump's 0
May 0
8 0
decision 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
international 0
pact. 0

That 0
move 0
continues 0
to 0
roil 0
relations 0
with 0
European 0
allies 0
who 0
are 0
sticking 0
with 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal. 0

They 0
appealed 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
to 0
exempt 0
them 0
from 0
sanctions 0
as 0
they 0
continue 0
to 0
do 0
business 0
with 0
Tehran. 0

But 0
one 0
goal 0
behind 0
report's 0
release, 0
according 0
to 0
an 0
official 0
familiar 0
with 0
its 0
contents, 0
is 0
to 0
make 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
is 0
not 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
exemptions 0
of 0
any 0
kind. 0

"As 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
begins 0
to 0
re-impose 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
and 0
Iranian 0
entities, 0
our 0
European 0
allies 0
must 0
understand 0
and 0
appreciate 0
that 0
doing 0
business 0
with 0
Iran 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
permissible," 0
the 0
source 0
said. 0

The 0
report 0
focuses 0
on 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
from 0
Iranian 0
oil 0
sales 0
that 0
were 0
frozen 0
in 0
Oman's 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
in 0
that 0
country's 0
currency, 0
the 0
rial. 0

Rials 0
are 0
pegged 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
dollar 0
and 0
are 0
difficult 0
to 0
convert. 0

But 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
Iran 0
was 0
promised 0
access 0
to 0
overseas 0
reserves 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
funds 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
frozen 0
by 0

To 0
access 0
the 0
rials, 0
Iran 0
wanted 0
to 0
convert 0
them 0
briefly 0
into 0

and 0

The 0
majority 0
report 0
by 0
the 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigation 0
says 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
Treasury, 0
at 0
the 0
instruction 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
State 0
Department, 0
granted 0
a 0
license 0
to 0
convert 0
the 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
briefly 0
into 0
American 0
dollars 0
so 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
converted 0
into 0
euros. 0

The 0
exchange 0
was 0
legal, 0
the 0
report 0
notes. 0

Officials 0
at 0
Treasury's 0
Office 0
of 0
Foreign 0
Assets 0
Control 0
asked 0
two 0
US 0
banks 0
to 0
work 0
as 0
intermediaries 0
and 0
execute 0
the 0
transaction, 0
but 0
they 0
declined, 0
citing 0
concern 0
over 0
potential 0
regulatory 0
backlash 0
and 0
a 0
ding 0
to 0
their 0
reputations. 0

Emails 0
reviewed 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
show 0
that 0
OFAC 0
officials 0
worked 0
to 0
encourage 0
banks 0
to 0
take 0
part 0
in 0
the 0
deal 0
by 0
proposing 0
to 0
bring 0
in 0
senior 0
officials. 0

"I 0
agree 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
idea 0
to 0
have 0
(Treasury 0
Secretary 0
Jack) 0
Lew 0
engage 0
(the 0
US 0

If 0
they 0
refuse 0
we 0
can 0
suggest 0
(Secretary 0

John) 0
Kerry 0
will 0
call, 0
which 0
will 0
drive 0
them 0
nuts," 0
an 0
email 0
from 0
a 0
US 0
government 0
official 0
said. 0

After 0
Treasury 0
officials 0
were 0
examining 0
whether 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal's 0
relevant 0
sanctions 0
permit 0
currency 0
exchange 0
of 0
rials 0
to 0
dollars, 0
the 0
report 0
says 0
a 0
Treasury 0
official 0
wrote 0
in 0
an 0
email, 0
"Yikes. 1

It 0
looks 0
like 0
we 0
committed 0
to 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
beyond 0
just 0
allowing 0
the 0
immobilized 0
funds 0
to 0
settle 0
out." 0

A 0
legal 0
transaction 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
Treasury 0
officials 0
concluded 0
that 0
the 0
transaction 0
was 0
legal. 0

The 0
report 0
said 0
they 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
were 0
"consistent 0
with 0
Iran's 0
position, 0
allowing 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
Iran 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
'transfers,' 0
'foreign 0

the 0
'purchase 0
or 0

of 0
Iran 0
of 0
US 0
bank 0

The 0
source 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
report 0
said 0
that 0
Congress 0
asked 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
directly 0
about 0
such 0
a 0
license, 0
but 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
was 0
under 0
no 0
legal 0
obligation 0
to 0
provide 0
the 0
licenses 0
to 0
Congress. 0

The 0
Republican 0
report 0
argues 0
that 0
in 0
pushing 0
for 0
the 0
license 0
to 0
go 0
forward, 0
Obama 0
officials 0
were 0
violating 0
financial 0
and 0
oil-related 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
Iran 0
stemming 0
from 0
the 0
seizure 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Embassy 0
in 0
Tehran 0
in 0
1979 0
and 0
trying 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
financial 0
system. 0

They 0
pointed 0
to 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Obama 0
officials, 0
including 0
Lew, 0
who 0
said 0
in 0
congressional 0
testimony 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
not 0
granted 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
financial 0

The 0

Haig 0
was 0
publicly 0
linked 0

Tuesday 0

In 0

news 0
conference 0
before 0
his 0
arrest, 0
Haig, 0
responding 0
to 0
the 0
documents' 0
release, 0
said 0
he 0
sold 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
to 0
Paddock 0
at 0
his 0
home 0
in 0
September 0
after 0
they 0
met 0
at 0
a 0
gun 0
show. 0

Tracer 0
ammunition 0
has 0
a 0

that, 0
when 0

leaves 0
an 0

have 0
a 0
more 0
precise 0
idea 0
of 0
where 0
the 0
bullet 0
is 0
going. 0

Haig 0
did 0
not 0
describe 0
the 0
ammunition 0
as 0
armor-piercing. 0

Victor, 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
news 0
conference 0
at 0
his 0
Phoenix-area 0
office, 0
said 0
the 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
that 0
Haig 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
"was 0
not 0
modified 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
... 0
from 0
manufacturer's 0
specs." 0

But 0
in 0
Friday's 0
criminal 0
complaint, 0
investigators 0
say 0
Haig 0
and 0
an 0
associate 0
also 0
claimed 0
they 0
sold 0
to 0
Paddock 0
other 0
ammunition 0
-- 0
four 0
or 0
five 0
10-round 0
packages 0
of 0
.308-caliber 0
incendiary 0
ammunition 0
-- 0
at 0
a 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
gun 0
show 0
in 0
August. 0

It's 0
not 0
clear 0
from 0
the 0
complaint 0
whether 0
the 0
two 0
armor-piercing 0
rounds 0
with 0
the 0
incendiary 0
capsule 0
are 0
from 0
the 0
packages 0
Haig 0
allegedly 0
told 0
investigators 0
he 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
at 0
the 0
gun 0
show. 0

The 0
complaint 0
also 0
does 0
not 0
say 0
whether 0
Paddock 0
fired 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
ammunition 0
that 0
he 0
bought 0
from 0

Haig, 0
an 0

said 0
at 0

anything 0

in 0
his 0

Paddock 0

Mesa 0
"very 0
well-dressed, 0
very 0
well-groomed, 0
very 0
polite, 0
very 0

"At 0

I 0

any 0

anything 0

also 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
received 0
death 0
threats 0
after 0
his 0

revealed 0
this 0

He 0
stressed 0
that 0
his 0

made 0
"no 0

to 0
the 0

since 0
Paddock 0
didn't 0

"I 0

today 0

at 0
a 0
Las 0

sometime 0

Paddock 0
at 0
a 0
subsequent 0
Phoenix 0
gun 0

where 0
he 0
was 0
selling 0
ammunition. 0

• 0
Paddock 0

card 0
because 0
the 0
seller 0
didn't 0
have 0
the 0
quantity 0
of 0
trace 0
ammunition 0
that 0
he 0
wanted. 0

• 0
Paddock 0
later 0
called 0
Haig 0
three 0
times 0
to 0
arrange 0
a 0
sale 0
at 0
Haig's 0

• 0
In 0

Paddock 0
arrived 0
at 0
Haig's 0

bought 0
the 0

and 0
drove 0

Before 0

him 0

"Sickness. 1

Horror 1
that 0
this 0

would 0

something 0

that." 0

Haig 0
spoke 0
with 0
investigators 0
four 0
times 0
after 0
the 0
shooting, 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
"fully 0
cooperative," 0
Victor 0
said. 0

"This 0
was 0
a 0
routine 0
transaction 0

"It's 0

I 1

One 0

the 0

publicly. 0

this 0

Clark 0
County 0
District 0
Court 0

Elissa 0
Cadish 0
allowed 0
a 0
small 0
portion 0
of 0
those 0

to 0
be 0
redacted 0
because 0
"there 0

In 0

to 0
a 0
question 0
from 0
CNN 0
in 0
January, 0
the 0
Clark 0
County 0
sheriff, 0
Joe 0
Lombardo, 0
said 0
federal 0
authorities 0
are 0
investigating 0
a 0
person 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

That 0
person 0
could 0

federal 0
charges 0
not 0
directly 0
related 0
to 0
the 0

within 0
the 0
next 0

the 0

when 0
he 0
met 0
him 0
just 0
a 0

weeks 0
before 0

Haig 0
says 0
he 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
720 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammunition 0
from 0
Haig's 0
home 0
gun 0
business. 0

"I 0
couldn't 0
detect 0
anything 0

this 0
guy," 0
he 0
said. 0

"He 0
told 0
me 0
exactly 0
what 0
he 0
wanted. 0

I 0
handed 0
him 0
a 0
box 0
with 0
the 0

he 0

"tracer 0

– 0
bullets 0
that 0
leave 0
a 0

"He 0
said 0
he 0
was 0

And 0
I 0

"may 0

to 0
commit 0
murder 0
with 0
a 0
deadly 0

Haig 0
strongly 0
denies 0
that. 0

"I 0
felt 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
hoping 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
find 0
a 0
connection 0
between 0

that 0
would 0

that 0

him 0
with 0

Deadly 0
Plague 1
Could 1
MUTATE 1
And 1
Become 1
Untreatable 1
As 1
It 1
Spreads 1
Globally 1

The 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
has 0
already 0
infected 0
2,000 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
and 0
killed 0
143 0
in 0
the 0
country’s 0
worst 0
outbreak 0
in 0
50 0
years. 0

But 0
health 0
officials 0
are 0
now 0
warning 0
the 1
deadly 1
bacteria 1
could 1
mutate 1
and 1
become 1
untreatable 1
as 0
it 0
spreads 0
across 0
the 0
globe. 0

Coupled 0
with 0
the 0
high 0
likelihood 0
that 0
this 0
disease 0
could 0
spread 0
globally 0
by 0
an 0
infected 0
traveler 0
getting 0
on 0
a 0
plane 0
to 0
Europe 0
or 0
America, 0
health 0
officials 0
are 0
now 0
warning 0
that 0
the 0
strain 0
of 0
plague 0
which 0
has 0
already 0
killed 0
more 0
than 0
140 0
Madagascar 0
could 1
mutate 1
and 1
become 1
untreatable. 1

Professor 0
Paul 0
Hunter 0
has 0
warned 0
that, 0
while 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
rather 0
easy 0
for 0
an 0
advanced 0
country 0
to 0
contain 0
the 0
disease 0
in 0
its 0
current 0
form, 0
he 1
fears 1
that 1
it 1
could 1
evolve 1
into 1
something 1
far 1
more 1
dangerous. 1

Hunter, 0
who 0
is 0
a 0
disease 0
expert 0
at 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
East 0
Anglia, 0
told 0
the 0
Daily 0
Star: 0
“If 0
it 0
reaches 0
the 0
UK, 0
Europe 0
or 0
the 0
US 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
similar 0
to 0
the 0
Ebola 0
outbreak. 0

We 0
would 0
have 0
a 0
few 0
isolated 0
cases 0
but 0
it 0
shouldn’t 0
spread 0
like 0
it 0
has 0
in 0
Madagascar.” 0
But 0
he 0
had 0
more 0
to 0
add. 0

“As 0
with 0
any 0
disease, 0
it’s 1
a 1
real 1
worry 1
that 1
it 1
mutates 1
and 1
become 1
untreatable,” 1
Hunter 0
said. 0

So 0
far, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
cases 0
of 0
the 0
black 0
death 0
have 0
the 0
been 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
a 0
more 0
deadly 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
which 0
devastated 1
Europe’s 0
population 0
in 0
the 0
1300s. 0

While 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
bites 0
of 0
infected 0
fleas, 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
air, 0
usually 0
by 0
coughing. 0

Airborne 0
infections 0
are 0
difficult 1
at 1
best 1
to 0
control. 0

Symptoms 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
include 0
a 0
very 0
high 0
fever, 0
coughing 0
(potentially 0
coughing 0
up 0
blood), 0
and 0
headaches. 0

Ten 0
African 0
nations 0
have 0
already 1
been 1
put 1
on 1
alert 1
that 0
the 0
plague 0
could 0
easily 0
spread 0
to 0
their 0
region 0
of 0
the 0
globe. 0

The 0
plague 0
can 0
be 0
fatal 0
24-48 0
hours 0
after 0
infection, 0
but 0
antibiotics 0
will 0
take 0
care 0
of 0
the 0
infection. 0

Schools 0
and 0
universities 0
have 0
been 0
closed 0
with 0
a 0
ban 0
issued 0
on 0
public 0
gatherings, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
tradition 0
of 0
“dancing 0
with 0
the 0
dead” 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
partially 0
blamed 0
for 0
the 0
disease’s 0
spread. 0

The 0
current 0
outbreak 0
is 0
also 0
highly 0
unusual 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
affected 0
urban 0
areas 0
increasing 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
transmission, 0
according 0
to 0

from 0
Candace 0
Smith 0
that 0
her 0

was 0
drunk 0
and 0
doing 0
something 0
to 0
her 0

from 0
the 0

says, 0
"No 0

Candace 0
Smith 0
told 0
officers 0
they 0
were 0
separating, 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
left 0
when 0
she 0
told 0
him 0
she 0
was 0
calling 0

"Female 0

his 0

so 0
she 0

A 0
Nov. 0

Candace 0
Smith 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
Westerville 0
police 0
station 0
asking 0
about 0
a 0
protection 0
order. 0

She 0
told 0
officers 0
that 0
Quentin 0
Smith 0
had 0
come 0
home 0
drunk 0
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
week 0
and 0
had 0
"forced 0
himself 0
on 0
her," 0
the 0
report 0
said. 0

Candace 0
Smith 0
said 0
she 0
had 0
found 0
out 0
that 0

she 0
had 0
been 0
infected 0
with 0
a 0
sexually 0

disease, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0

Candace 0
Smith 0
also 0
told 0

that 0
her 0

had 0
threatened 0
to 0
kill 0
her, 0
their 0
daughter 0
and 0
himself 0
if 0
she 0
left 0
him. 0

She 0
said 0
Smith 0
always 0
carried 0
a 0
gun 0
despite 0
being 0
a 0
convicted 0
felon. 0

Smith 0
was 0
convicted 0
in 0

Cleveland, 0
of 0
felony 0
burglary 0
and 0
misdemeanor 0

charges 0
in 0

was 0
sentenced 0
to 0
four 0

Shortly 0
after 0
Candace 0
Smith 0
spoke 0
with 0
police 0
at 0
the 0
Westerville 0
station 0
that 0
day, 0
police 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
home 0
when 0
Quentin 0
Smith 0
called 0
to 0
complain 0
that 0
his 0
wife 0
had 0
locked 0
him 0
out 0
of 0
the 0

Queen's 0

Wes 0

told 0
the 0

watched 0
'Oumuamua’s 0
brightness 0
change 0
over 0
time 0
to 0
model 0
exactly 0
how 0
it 0
was 0

'Oumuamua 0
“appears 0

the 0

This 0

better 0

“tumbling.” 0

“Tumbling 0

The 0
icy 0
cigar 0
was 0
probably 0
knocked 0
askew 0
by 0
a 0
violent 0
collision 0
with 0
another 0
object. 0

The 0
researchers 0
don’t 0
know 0
exactly 0
when 0
this 0
happened, 0
but 0
suspect 0
it 0
took 0
place 0
before 0
'Oumuamua 0
left 0
its 0
home 0
stellar 0
system. 0

"It's 0
hard 0
to 0
know 0
if 0
it 0
was 0
during 0
planet 0
formation 0
or 0
after 0
the 0
planet 0
formation 0
process," 0
Fraser 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
show. 0

"Certainly, 0
more 0
collisions 0
happen 0
while 0
planets 0
are 0
growing 0
than 0
afterwards, 0
so 0
that’s 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
guess. 0

But 0
unfortunately 0
we 0
can’t 0
get 0
a 0
high-resolution 0
image 0
of 0
this 0
thing 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
kind 0
of 0
crater 0
is 0
on 0
it 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
attributed 0
to 0
the 0
collision 0
that 0
caused 0
it 0
to 0
start 0
tumbling." 0

The 0
team 0
think 0
'Oumuamua 0
may 0
eventually 0
move 0
less 0
chaotically. 0

"The 0
tumbling 0
actually 0
causes 0
stresses 0
and 0
strains 0
internal 0
to 0
the 0
object, 0
and 0
that 0
slowly 0
but 0
surely 0
squeezes 0
and 0
pulls 0
on 0
the 0
object 0
just 0
like 0
tides 0
on 0
the 0
Earth 0
to 0
remove 0
energy 0
from 0
the 0
spin," 0
Fraser 0
said. 0

But, 0
at 0
least 0
for 0
the 0
next 0
few 0
billion 0
years, 0
the 0
space 0
invader 0
is 0
destined 0
to 0
continue 0
its 1
topsy-turvy 1
spin. 1

for 0

of 0

on 0

II's 0
encyclical 0
Veritatis 0
Splendor 0
at 0
the 0
Comenius 0
University 0
in 0
Bratislava, 0
organized 0
by 0
the 0
Slovakian 0
Bishops' 0
Conference. 0

In 0
remarks 0
after 0
his 0
address, 0
reported 0
by 0
the 0
German 0
Catholic 0
newspaper 0
Die 0
Tagespost, 0
the 1
cardinal 1
made 0
it 0
clear 0
what 0
he 0
thinks 0
about 0
the 0
recently 0
presented 0
German 0
idea 0
of 0
blessing 0
homosexual 0
unions, 0
even 0
if 0
only 0
in 0
individual 0
cases: 0
“If 1
a 1
priest 1
blesses 1
a 1
homosexual 1
couple, 1
then 1
this 1
is 1
an 1
atrocity 1
at 1
a 1
holy 1
site, 1
namely, 1
to 1
approve 1
of 1
something 1
that 1
God 1
does 1
not 1
approve 1
of.” 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Tagespost 0
report, 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
said 0
in 0
his 0
address 0
that 0
he 0
regrets 0
the 0
separation 0
of 0
the 0
Church's 0
doctrinal 0
and 0
moral 0
teaching 0
and 0
called 0
Christianity 0
a 0
“theocentric 1
humanism.” 1
He 0
said 0
the 0
“submissive 1
change 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
into 1
a 1
NGO 1
for 1
the 1
embetterment 1
of 1
the 1
this-worldly 1
life 1
conditions” 1
is 1
a 1
“suicidal 1
modernization” 1
that 1
denies 1
mankind 1
the 1
Truth 1
of 1
God. 1

In 0
this 0
context, 0
the 0
German 0
cardinal 0
also 0
criticized 0
Martin 0
Luther's 0
own 0
denial 0
of 0
man's 0
free 0
will 0
and 0
his 0
teaching 0
about 0
the 0
total 0
depravity 0
of 0
man 0
that 0
separates 0
morality 0
from 0
the 0
relationship 0
with 0
God. 0

Morality, 0
Müller 0
explained, 0
is 0
rooted 0
in 0
Grace; 0
that 0
is 0
why 0
any 0
teaching 0
about 0
“rules 0
and 0
exceptions” 0
ignores 0
the 0
character 0
of 0
the 0
ethics 0
of 0
the 0
Covenant 0
and 0
of 0
Grace. 0

In 0
the 0
discussion 0
following 0
his 0
talk, 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
also 0
responded 0
to 0
questions 0
concerning 0
Pope 0
Francis' 0
post-synodal 0
exhortation, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

The 0
cardinal 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
“not 0
happy” 0
about 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
different 0
interpretations 0
of 0
this 0
papal 0
text 0
by 0
some 0
bishops' 0
conferences. 0

“In 1
dogmatic 1
questions, 1
there 1
cannot 1
be 1
a 1
plurality,” 1
he 0
added. 0

There 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
Magisterium, 1
he 1
said, 1
and 1
bishops' 1
conferences 1
can 1
only 1
decide 1
about 1
pastoral 1
questions. 1

Contradictory 0
conceptions 0
concerning 0
the 0
Sacraments, 0
said 0
the 0
cardinal, 0
lead 0
into 0
chaotic 0
conditions. 0

Thus, 0
explained 0
the 0
cardinal, 0
the 1
Sacraments 1
have 1
to 1
be 1
celebrated 1
the 1
way 1
Christ 1
Himself 1
willed 1
it 1
when 1
he 1
instituted 1
them. 1

The 0
controversial 0
eighth 0
chapter 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
understood 0
“in 0
an 0
orthodox 0
way,” 0
namely 0
that 0
“he 1
who 1
lives 1
in 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
mortal 1
sin 1
cannot 1
receive 1
Holy 1
Communion.” 1
It 0
is, 0
in 0
Müller's 0
eyes, 0
the 0
pope's 0
duty 0
“to 0
unite 0
the 0
Church, 0
that 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
there 0
for.” 0
This 0
is 0
what 0
he, 0
Müller, 0
himself 0
told 0
the 0
pope: 0
when 0
the 0
bishops' 0
conferences 0
present 0
different 0
interpretations 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia, 0
the 0
Church 0
enters 0
“into 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
the 0
one 0
before 0
the 0
Reformation.” 0

Zvolensy, 0

Promulgated 0
25 0

the 0
encyclical 0
rejects 0
authoritatively 0
the 0
theory 0
of 0
situation 0
ethics, 0
a 0
theory 0
that 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
getting 0
again 0
much 0
attention 0
in 0
our 0
time, 0
for 0
example 0
by 0

as 0

John 0
Paul 0
II 0
Institute 0
for 0

on 0
Marriage 0
and 0
the 0
Family, 0
was 0
another 0
speaker 0
at 0
the 0
February 0
6 0
conference. 0

He 0
stressed 0
that 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
“read 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
magisterial 0
instructions 0
of 0
the 0
encyclical 0
Veritatis 0
Splendor, 0
which 0
recalls 0
the 0
connection 0
between 0
conscience 0
and 0
truth, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
necessity 0
of 0
a 0
well-formed 0
conscience.” 0
In 0
returning 0
to 0
that 0
encyclical, 0
explained 0
the 0
Italian 0
professor 0
and 0
theologian, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
could 0
be 0
given 0
a 0
hermeneutic 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
a 0
“continuity 0
with 0
the 0
Magisterium 0
of 0
the 0
Church.” 0
He 0
also 0
said: 0
“The 1
Commandments 1
are 1
an 1
expression 1
of 1
the 1
Love 1
of 1

Instead, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
POLICIES 1
have 0
actually 0
made 0
life 0
more 0
difficult 0
for 0
Putin 0
at 0
every 0
turn. 0

Here’s 0
The 0
Federalist’s 0
Mollie 0
Hemingway 0
explaining: 0

Our 0
relationship 0
with 0
Russia 0
is 0
at 0
a 0
significant 0
low 0
point 0
where 0
just 0
having 0
some 0
conversations 0
can 0
lead 0
us 0
to 0
a 0
better 0
outcome. 0

And 0
there 0
are 0
so 0
many 0
important 0
things 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
involved 0
with 0
that 0
we 0
care 0
about, 0
whether 0
it’s 0
Syria, 0
Ukraine, 0
North 0
Korea 0
or 0
nuclear 0
arms. 0

I’m 0
kind 0
of 0
surprised 0
there’s 0
been 0
this 0
much 0
angst 0
over 0
this 0
press 0
conference. 0

Not 0
that 0
he 0
said 0
things 0
the 0
way 0
he 0
should 0
have. 0

President 0
Trump 0
really 0
did 0
mess 0
up 0
with 0
that 0
press 0
conference 0
but 0
I 0
don’t 0
quite 0
know 0
what 0
people 0
want. 0

He 0
actually 0
is 0
pretty 0
tough 1
on 0
Russia. 0

And 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
years, 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
an 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
military 0
budget, 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
an 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
intelligence 0
budget. 0

We 0
are 0
doing 0
NATO 0
exercises 0
in 0
the 0
Baltics. 0

We 0
provided 0
legal 0
aid 0
to 0
Ukraine 0
and 0
Georgia. 0

We’re 0
developing 0
low-yield 0
nuclear 0
weapons. 0

He 0
implemented 0
sanctions 0
that 0
were 0
even 0
stronger 0
than 0
required 0
by 0
Congressional 0
mandate. 0

So 0
if 0
you 0
care 0
about 0
actual 0
actions, 0
I 0
think 0
there’s 0
a 0
lot 0
to 0
be 0
happy 0
about 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
a 0
tough 1
posture 0
towards 0
Russia. 0

People 0
are 0
obsessed 0
about 0
words 0
and 0
they 0
should 0
maybe 0
focus 0
on 0
the 0
actions 0
as 0
well. 0

Former 0
Speaker 0
of 0
the 0
House, 0
Newt 0
Gingrich, 0
concurred 0
with 0
Hemingway 0
arguing 0
that 0
by 0
any 0
standard 0
Trump 0
has 0
been 0
far 0
tougher 0
on 0
Russia 0
than 0
Obama 0
was. 0

First, 0
the 0
very 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
loudest 0
in 0
attacking 0
President 0
Trump 0
about 0
his 0
performance 0
at 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
summit 0
are 0
the 0
people 0
who 0
failed 0
to 0
protect 1
America 1
from 0
Russian 0
meddling 0
in 0
2016. 0

The 0
very 1
intensity 0
and 0
nastiness 1
of 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Brennan 0
and 0
former 0
Director 0
of 0
National 0
Intelligence 0
Clapper 0
is 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
distract 0
attention 0
from 0
their 0
failure 0
to 0
protect 1
America. 1

It 0
was 0
their 0
duty 0
in 0
2016 0
– 0
not 0
candidate 0
Trump’s. 0

Second, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
been 0
far 0
tougher 1
on 0
Russia 0
than 0
President 0
Obama 0
ever 0
dreamed 0
of 0
being. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
is 0
taking 0
real 0
actions 0
designed 0
to 0
weaken 0
Russia 0
and 0
force 0
Putin 0
to 0
change 0
his 0
aggressive 1
behavior. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
has 0
levied 0
tough 1
sanctions 0
on 0
Russia. 0

Also, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
public 0
lecture 0
about 0
Germany 0
not 0
buying 0
natural 0
gas 0
from 0
Russia 0
was 0
aimed 0
at 0
cutting 0
Putin 0
off 0
from 0
hard 0
currency 0
worth 0
tens 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
and 0
further 0
weakening 0
the 0
Russian 0
economy. 0

Furthermore, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
efforts 0
to 0
get 0
our 1
European 0
allies 0
to 0
increase 0
their 0
defense 0
spending 0
has 0
a 0
direct 0
impact 0
on 0
Putin. 0

The 0
stronger 0
NATO 0
is, 0
the 0
less 0
maneuvering 0
room 0
Russia 0
has. 0

Beyond 0
pressuring 0
our 1
allies, 1
consider 0
these 0
specific 0
steps 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
taken 0
against 0
Russia: 0
Where 0
President 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
provide 0
serious 0
weapons 0
to 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
defend 0
themselves 0
(his 0
response 0

the 0

Against 0

Fisher 0
is 0
rightly 1
incensed 1
by 0
Bergoglio’s 0
cunning 1
response, 0
“I 0
will 0
not 0
say 0
a 0
single 0
word 0
on 0
this 0
, 0
” 0
concerning 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
damning 1
indictment 1
of 0
Bergoglio’s 0
rehabilitation 0
of 0
the 1
monster 1
once 1
known 1
as 1
Cardinal 1
McCarrick 1
for 0
some 0
five 0
years 0
before 0
adverse 0

of 0

Viganò 0
had 0
personally 0

him 0
back 0
in 0
2013—information 0
of 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
was 0
clearly 0
already 0
aware 0
at 0
that 0
time, 0
as 0
Viganò 0
testifies. 0

I 0
never 0
thought 0
I’d 0
see 0
the 0
day 0
when 0
a 1
preening, 1
Internet-created 1
neo-Catholic 1
doyenne 1
such 0
as 0
Simcha 0
Fisher, 0
as 0
notorious 0
as 0
Mark 0
Shea 0
for 0
her 0
crude 1
and 1
often 1
unprintable 1
invective 1
against 0
traditionalists, 0
would 0
unload 1
on 1
Pope 1
Bergoglio 1
with 0
the 0
following 0
headline: 0
“Does 1
Francis 1
know 1
he 1
sounds 1
like 1
an 1
abuser?” 1

The 0
scales 0
have 0
fallen 0
from 0
Fisher’s 0
eyes 0
and 0
now, 0
at 0
last, 0
she 0
sees 0
Bergoglio, 0
however 0
grudgingly, 0
for 0
what 0
he 0
is: 0
a 1
power-mad 1
ecclesiastical 1
tyrant. 1

(A 0
tyrant, 0
moreover, 0
who 0
has 0
ascended 0
to 0
the 0
papacy 0
in 0
a 0
manner 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
the 0
ascension 0
of 0
the 1
corrupt 1
Benedict 1
IX, 1
another 0
“disgrace 1
to 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter,” 1
following 0
the 0
machinations 0
of 0
a 0
Roman 0
cabal, 0
as 0
I 0
discuss 0
below.) 0

Quoth 0
Fisher: 0

I 0
have 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
friends 0
who 0
have 0
escaped 0
abusive 0
marriages. 0

They 0
tell 0
me 0
that 0
Pope 1
Francis 1
is 1
sounding 1
more 1
and 1
more 1
like 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
abused 1
them. 1

He’s 1
sounding 1
like 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
hid 1
that 1
abuse 1
from 1
the 1
world, 1
who 1
taught 1
their 1
victims 1
to 1
blame 1
themselves, 1
who 1
used 1
spiritual 1
pressure 1
to 1
persuade 1
them 1
and 1
their 1
families 1
that 1
it 1
would 1
actually 1
be 1
wrong, 1
sinful, 1
to 1
defend 1
themselves. 1

Just 0
listen 0
to 0
him. 0

After 0
responding 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
about 0
Vigano’s 0
very 0
serious 0
accusations, 0
he 0
said 0
point 0
blank, 0
“I 0
will 0
not 0
say 0
a 0
single 0
word 0
on 0
this.”… 0
[F]or 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
week 0
and 0
more, 0
he 0
kept 0
up 0
an 0
unmistakable 0
theme 0
of 0
calling 0
for 0
silence, 0
equating 0
silence 0
with 0
holiness, 0
and 0
painting 0
himself 0
as 0
a 1
Christlike 1
victim 1
in 0
his 0
silence. 0

Then 0
he 0
says 0
it’s 0
“ugly” 0
to 0
accuse 0
others 0
of 0
sinning. 0

Then 0
he 0
suggests 0
that 0
healing 1
and 1
reconciliation 1
will 1
only 1
come 1
if 1
we 1
take 1
a 1
hard 1
look 1
at 1
our 1
own 1
flaws…. 1

To 1
the 1
victims 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
and 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
love 1
them, 1
it 1
sounds 1
like 1
he 1
is 1
saying, 1
“Who 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
you 1
are? 1

I 1
don’t 1
have 1
to 1
explain 1
myself 1
to 1
you. 1

You’re 1
the 1
guilty 1
one. 1

You 1
brought 1
this 1
on 1
yourself. 1

If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
be 1
loved, 1
then 1
know 1
your 1
place. 1

I’m 1
the 1
victim, 1
here, 1
not 1
you. 1

If 1
you 1
know 1
what’s 1
good 1
for 1
you, 1
keep 1
your 1
mouth 1
shut.” 1
This 1
is 1
how 1
abusers 1
talk. 1

They’re 1
not 1
content 1
with 1
power; 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
keep 1
their 1
victims 1
doubting 1
and 1
blaming 1
themselves 1
constantly, 1
so 1
they 1
don’t 1
become 1
a 1
threat. 1

Whether 1
Francis 1
knows 1
it 1
or 1
not, 1
this 1
is 1
how 1
he 1
sounds. 1

We 0
can 0
overlook 0
the 0
fig 0
leaf 0
“whether 0
Francis 0
knows 0
it 0
or 0
not…”. 0

Fisher 1
knows 1
that 1
Francis 1
knows 1
it, 1
even 1
if 1
she 1
still 1
cannot 1
bring 1
herself 1
to 1
say 1
explicitly 1
what 1
should 1
now 1
be 1
apparent 1
to 1
the 1
entire 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
faithful: 1
that 0
Bergoglio’s 1
very 1
presence 1
on 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter 1
is 1
a 1
grave 1
threat 1
to 1
the 1
common 1
good 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
and 1
the 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
Faith. 1

Yet 0
Fisher 0
maintains 0
a 0
sliver 0
of 0
space 0
for 0
deniability 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
maintain 0
that 0
indispensable 0
distinction 0
between 0
her 0
and 0
those 1
loathsome 1
traditionalists: 1
“I 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
ideological 0
reason 0
to 0
want 0
to 0
bring 0
him 0
down. 0

I 0
have 0
defended 0
him 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
I 0
could, 0
up 0
until 0
the 0
Chile 0
debacle. 0

And 0
so 0
I 0
am 0
working 0
as 0
hard 0
as 0
I 0
can 0
not 0
to 0
assume 0
the 0
worst, 0
not 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
this 1
man 1
who 1
promised 1
so 1
much 1
fresh 1
air 1
is 1
really 1
so 1
intent 1
on 1
slamming 1
doors 1
shut 1
before 1
we 1
find 1
out 1
even 1
worse 1
things 1
hidden 1
inside. 1

But 1
he 1
is 1
not 1
making 1
it 1
easy. 1

I 1
am 1
not 1
saying 1
he 1
is 1
an 1
abuser. 1

But 1
he 1
sounds 1
like 1
one.” 1

That 0
is, 0
Fisher 0
was 0
not 0
concerned 0
about 0
Bergoglio’s 0
relentless 1
assault 1
on 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
and 0
practice—to 0
her, 0
opposition 0
to 0
Francis 0
on 0
that 0
account 0
is 0
just 0
“ideology”—but 0
only 0
his 0
role 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests. 0

But 0
why 0
is 0
Fisher 0
still 0
“working 0
hard 0
not 0
to 0
assume 0
the 0
worst” 0
when 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
anything 0
to 0
assume 0
as 0
the 0
ever-mounting 0
evidence 0
of 0
malintent 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
plain 0
view 0
for 0
years? 0

Indeed, 0
why 0
else 0
did 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
risk 1
everything 1
in 0
order 0
to 0
expose 0
this 0
Pope, 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
extent 0
of 0
revealing 0
matters 0
supposedly 0
within 0
the 0
scope 0
of 0
“the 0
Pontifical 0
secret”? 0

On 0
orders 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
the 0
Vatican 0
secret 0
police 0
are 0
reportedly 0
scouring 0
the 0
globe 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
Viganò, 0
who 0
has 0
gone 0
into 0
hiding, 0
“in 0
order 0
to 0
prevent 0
more 0
unpredictable 0
damage 0
to 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0

the 0
Holy 0
See 0
on 0
the 0
world 0
stage, 0
but 0
also 0
to 0
‘prepare 0
the 0
terrain’ 0
for 0
the 1
former 1
apostolic 1
nuncio-turned-whistleblower 1
to 0
be 0
prosecuted” 0
under 0
canon 0
law. 0

The 1
Dictator 1
Pope 1
must 0
destroy 0
his 0
most 0
potent 0
critic 0
thus 0
far. 0

Everything 1
depends 1
on 1
it! 1

But 0
it 0
may 0
already 0
be 0
too 0
late 0
to 0
save 0
a 0
regime 0
whose 0
only 0
defense 0
is 0
not 0
truth 0
but 0
raw 0
power. 0

At 0
last 0
count, 0
some 0
29 0
bishops 0
have 0
publicly 0
declared 0
Viganò’s 0
allegations 0
against 0
Bergoglio 0
credible 0
and 0
worthy 0
of 0
investigation. 0

Now 0
even 0
the 0
distinguished 0
canonist 0
Edward 0
Peters, 0
who 0
is 0
no 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
Referendary 0
of 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura 0
appointed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
declares 0
that 0
if 0
Viganò’s 0
allegations 0
are 0
true 0
then 0
Bergoglio 0
must 0
go: 0

Of 0
what 0
was 0
said 0
above 0
concerning 0
resignation 0
from 0
Church 0
office 0
in 0
general, 0
what 0
would 0
not 0
apply 0
to 0
a 0
pope, 0
of 0
all 0
office 0
holders, 0
if 0
he, 0
as 0
alleged 0
by 0
Viganò, 0
from 0
the 0
first 0
months 0
of 0
his 0
papacy 0
knowingly 0
protected 0
and 0
favored 0
a 0
cardinal 0
who 0
was 0
[pick 0
a 0
disgusting 0
verb]-ing 0
seminarians? 0

By 1
what 1
possible 1
stretch 1
of 1
the 1
imagination 1
would 1
such 1
an 1
occupant 1
be 1
suited 1
for 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter? 1

Does 0
the 0
historical 0
fact 0
that 0
some 0
pretty 0
bad 0
popes 0
held 0
on 0
to 0
office 0
despite 0
committing 0
various 0
offenses 0
justify 0
other 0
popes 0
acting 0
badly 0
in 0
shirking 0
even 0
the 0
minimal 0
gesture 0
of 0
resigning? 0

Viganò 0
is 0
unquestionably 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
know, 0
and 0
claims 0
to 0
know, 0
whether 0
his 0
central 0
allegation 0
that 0
Francis’ 0
was 1
covering 1
for 1
McCarrick, 1
big 1
time, 1
for 0
years, 0
is 0
correct. 0

Believing, 0
as 0
he 0
does, 0
that 0
his 0
claims 0
are 0
correct, 0
Viganò, 0
in 0
calling 0
for 0
Francis’ 0
resignation, 0
has 0
done 0
nothing 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
than 0
exercise 0
his 0
right 0
under 0
canon 0
law 0
“to 0
manifest 0
to 0
the 0
sacred 0
pastors 0
[his] 0
opinion 0
on 0
matters 0
which 0
pertain 0
to 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
to 0
make 0
[his] 0
opinion 0
known 0
to 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
Christian 0
faithful…” 0
1983 0
CIC 0
212 0
§ 0
3. 0

I 0
have 0
not 0
called 0
for 0
Francis’ 0
resignation 0
because 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
(with 0
the 0
degree 0
of 0
certitude 0
that 0
a 0
lawyer 0
seeks) 0
whether 0
Viganò’s 0
key 0
allegations 0
against 0
Francis 0
are 0
substantially 0
true; 0
most 0
assuredly, 0
however, 0
if 0
I 0
reach 0
the 0
conclusion 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
true, 0
I 0
would 0
say, 0
without 0
hesitation, 0
that 0
Francis 0
should 0
resign. 0

Bergoglio 1
will 1
not, 1
of 1
course, 1
resign. 1

He 1
will 1
cling 1
to 1
power 1
with 1
his 1
last 1
breath 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
the 1
many 1
other 1
acts 1
of 1
ecclesial 1
subversion 1
he 1
clearly 1
has 1
in 1
mind. 1

The 0
only 0
remedies 0
for 0
the 1
plague 1
of 1
Bergoglio 1
are 0
his 0
natural 0
death 0
or 0
deposition. 0

Yes, 0
deposition. 0

Canon212 0
has 0
linked 0
to 0
an 0
interesting 0
and 0
timely 0
piece 0
on 0
the 0
role 0
of 0
the 0
Synod 0
of 0
Sutri, 0
near 0
Rome, 0
in 0
1046, 0
which 0
dealt 0
with 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
three 0
rival 0
claimants 0
to 0
the 0
papacy, 0
each 0
installed 0
by 0
a 0
Roman 0
faction: 0
First, 0
the 1
execrable 1
Benedict 1
IX, 1
mentioned 0
above. 0

Second, 0
the 1
interloper 1
Sylvester 1
III, 1
installed 0
in 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
Peter 0
after 0
Benedict 0
had 0
been 0
driven 0
from 0
Rome. 0

Third, 0
the 1
well-intentioned 1
but 1
dimwitted 1
Gregory 1
VI, 1
whose 0
election 0
was 0
tainted 0
by 0
a 0
seemingly 0
simoniacal 0
negotiation 0
with 0
Benedict, 0
who 0
had 0
returned 0
to 0
Rome 0
in 0
1045 0
and 0
ousted 0
Sylvester, 0
according 0
to 0
which 0
Benedict 0
would 0
receive 0
a 0
generous 0
pension 0
if 0
he 0
resigned 0
the 0
papacy, 0
which 0
Benedict 0
did 0
only 0
to 0
rescind 0
his 0
resignation. 0

The 0
Synod 0
was 0
convoked 0
by 0
Henry 0
III, 0
the 0
German 0
king 0
and 0
soon-to-be-crowned 0
Holy 0
Roman 0
Emperor, 0
a 1
pious 1
and 1
austere 1
Christian 1
and 1
an 1
exponent 1
of 1
the 1
Cluniac 1
spirit 1
of 1
reform. 1

The 0
Synod 0
declared 0
that 0
Benedict 0
IX 0
(who 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
appear) 0
was 0
deposed 0
notwithstanding 0
his 0
attempt 0
to 0
undo 0
his 0
resignation. 0

As 0
for 0
Sylvester, 0
the 0
Synod 0
declared 0
that 0
he 0
be 0
“stripped 1
of 1
his 1
sacerdotal 1
rank 1
and 1
shut 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
monastery.” 1
Gregory 0
was 0
also 0
declared 0
deposed, 0
either 0

At 0
Henry 0
III’s 0
designation, 0
the 0
German 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Bamberg 0
became 0
Clement 0
II, 0
but 0
he 0
died 0
after 0
only 0
a 0
year, 0
whereupon 0
Benedict 0
reasserted 0
his 0
claim 0
to 0
the 0
papacy 0
for 0
the 0
third 0
time 0
in 0
1047, 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
driven 0
from 0
Rome 0
again 0
by 0
Imperial 0
troops 0
in 0
1048. 0

Damasus 0
II, 0
another 0
German 0
bishop 0
designated 0
by 0
Henry, 0
reigned 0
for 0
a 0
mere 0
three 0
weeks 0
before 0
dying, 0
whereupon 0
Pope 0
St. 0
Leo 0
IX 0
succeeded 0
to 0
the 0
papacy, 0
reigning 0
until 0
1054. 0

Leo, 0
as 0
John 0
Rao 0
observes, 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
in 0
a 0
line 0
of 0
Popes 0
who 0
“took 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
movement 0
of 0
innovative 0
Christian 0
restoration” 0
which 0
included 0
a 0
breaking 0
of 0
the 0
dominance 0
of 0
Roman 0
nobility 0
over 0
papal 0
elections. 0

(Rao, 0
Black 0
Legends, 0
147-148). 0

As 0
the 0
cited 0
article 0
on 0
the 0
Synod 0
of 0
Sutri 0
notes, 0
although 0
the 1
scurrilous 1
Benedict 1
IX 1
objected 0
to 0
his 0
deposition 0
by 0
the 0
Synod, 0
“the 0
Church 0
has 0
always 0
accepted 0
his 0
deposition 0
as 0
valid. 0

The 0
King 0
of 0
Germany 0
then 0
appointed 0
Clement 0
II 0
as 0
Pope, 0
who 0
promptly 0
crowned 0
the 0
King, 0
Holy 0
Roman 0
Emperor. 0

Benedict 0
IX, 0
after 0
the 0
death 0
of 0
Clement, 0
claimed 0
the 0
papacy 0
again! 0

The 0
Church 0
to 0
this 0
day 0
recognizes 0
Clement 0
II 0
as 0
a 0
true 0
Pope.” 0

Moreover, 0
Benedict 0
IX 0
himself 0
is 0
recognized 0
as 0
a 0
true 0
Pope—a 0
valid 0
but 0
deposed 0
Pope—during 0
three 0
separate 0
periods 0
listed 0
as 0
three 0
distinct 0
pontificates 0
in 0
the 0
canon 0
of 0
Popes. 0

This 0
was 0
possible 0
owing 0
to 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
any 0
set 0
canonical 0
form 0
for 0
papal 0
elections; 0
a 0
Pope 0
could 0
gain 0
or 0
regain 0
the 0
office 0
by 0
various 0
machinations. 0

Indeed, 0
even 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
own 0
website 0
states 0
that 0
Benedict 0
was 0
Pope 0
from 0
1047-1048, 0
the 0
very 0
year 0
of 0
his 0
third 0
ascension 0
to 0
the 0
office 0
from 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
finally 0
driven 0
by 0
force. 0

Only 0
with 0
the 0
ascension 0
of 0
Pope 0
Nicholas 0
II 0
in 0
1059 0
was 0
it 0
established 0
that 0
henceforth 0
the 0
cardinal-bishops 0
would 0
elect 0
the 0
Pope, 0
with 0
the 0
other 0
cardinals 0
having 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
confirm 0
or 0
veto 0
the 0
nominee. 0

By 0
1100 0
what 0
we 0
now 0
know 0
as 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals, 0
embracing 0
all 0
the 0
cardinals 0
of 0
different 0
titles, 0
had 0
the 0
exclusive 0
right 0
to 0
elect 0
a 0
Pope, 0
and 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
College 0
“have 0
held 0
it 0
ever 0
since.” 0
(Eric 0
John, 0
The 0
Popes, 0
181). 0

These 0
lessons 0
of 0
history 0
should 0
suffice 0
to 1
dispel 1
the 1
pious 1
fable, 1
never 0
a 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Magisterium, 0
that 0
every 0
Pope 0
is 0
chosen 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
Ghost 0
to 0
lead 0
the 0
Church. 0

This 0
theological 0
error, 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
has 1
exploited 1
to 1
the 1
hilt, 1
is 0
a 0
key 0
element 0
in 0
the 0
related 0
error 0
of 0
papalotry, 0
which 0
elevates 0
the 0
person 0
of 0
the 0
Pope 0
above 0
the 0
office 0
he 0
occupies 0
and 0
makes 0
of 0
him 0
the 1
leader 1
of 1
a 1
personality 1
cult 1
everyone 1
is 1
commanded 1
to 1
“love” 1
(in 1
the 1
superficially 1
emotional 1
sense) 1
and 1
obey 1
no 1
matter 1
what 1
he 1
says 1
or 1
does, 1
rather 0
than 0
a 1
custodian 1
and 1
defender 1
of 1
the 1
Deposit 1
of 1
Faith 1
whose 1
lovability, 1
personality 1
and 1
opinions 1
are 1
utterly 1
irrelevant 1
to 1
the 1
exercise 1
and 1
scope 1
of 1
his 1
office. 1

As 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
has 0
observed, 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
a 0
Pope 0
“the 0
Spirit’s 0
role 0
should 0
be 0
understood 0
in 0
a 0
much 0
more 0
elastic 0
sense, 0
not 0
that 0
he 0
[sic] 0
dictates 0
the 0
candidate 0
for 0
whom 0
one 0
must 0
vote…. 0

There 1
are 1
too 1
many 1
contrary 1
instances 1
of 1
popes 1
the 1
Holy 1
Spirit 1
obviously 1
would 1
not 1
have 1
picked!” 1
Bergoglio 1
is 1
undeniably 1
one 1
of 1
them. 1

So 0
what 0
can 0
be 0
done 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Church 0
against 0
Bergoglio? 0

That 0
the 0
mode 0
of 0
papal 0
election 0
by 0
cardinals 0
has 0
persisted 0
for 0
nearly 0
a 0
thousand 0
years 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
general 0
impression 0
that 0
it 0
pertains 0
to 0
the 0
irreformable 0
divine 0
constitution 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
but 0
it 0
certainly 0
does 0
not. 0

As 0
to 0
matters 0
of 0
purely 0
ecclesiastical 0
law 0
such 0
as 0
this 0
one 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
always 0
allowed 0
for 0
departures 0
from 0
traditional 0
practice 0
in 0
cases 0
of 0
emergency 0
or 0
grave 0
necessity. 0

And 0
just 0
as 0
a 0
synod 0
was 0
employed 0
to 0
address 0
three 0
rival 0
claimants 0
to 0
the 0
papal 0
throne 0
in 0
1046, 0
declaring 0
at 0
least 0
two 0
of 0
them 0
deposed, 0
so 0
today 0
might 0
it 0
be 0
possible 0
for 0
reform-minded 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops, 0
comprising 0
an 0
imperfect 0
council, 0
to 0
undo 0
the 1
incalculable 1
damage 1
caused 0
by 0
the 0
cabal 0
that 0
lobbied 0
for 0
Bergoglio’s 0
election 0
before 0
the 0
last 0
conclave—a 0
cabal 0
that 0
included 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
McCarrick, 0
whom 0
Bergoglio 0
rewarded 0
by 0
rehabilitating 0
that 1
monster 1
despite 0
the 1
massive 1
evidence 1
of 1
his 1
unspeakable 1
crimes. 1

What 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
grounds 0
for 0
a 0
declaration 0
of 0
deposition 0
at 0
such 0
a 0
gathering 0
of 0
prelates? 0

One 0
could 0
readily 0
point 0
to 0
the 0
evidence 0
that 0
a 0
faction 0
that 0
included 0
Bergoglio 0
himself 0
had 0
agreed 0
upon 0
his 0
election 0
before 0
the 0
conclave, 0
and 0
that 0
all 0
those 0
involved, 0
including 0
Bergoglio, 0
were 0
thereby 0
excommunicated 0
latae 0
sententiae 0
in 1
accordance 1
with 1
Article 1
81 1
of 1
John 1
Paul 1
II’s 1
Universi 1
Dominici 1
Gregis, 1
which 1
provides: 1

The 1
Cardinal 1
electors 1
shall 1
further 1
abstain 1
from 1
any 1
form 1
of 1
pact, 1
agreement, 1
promise 1
or 1
other 1
commitment 1
of 1
any 1
kind 1
which 1
could 1
oblige 1
them 1
to 1
give 1
or 1
deny 1
their 1
vote 1
to 1
a 1
person 1
or 1
persons. 1

If 1
this 1
were 1
in 1
fact 1
done, 1
even 1
under 1
oath, 1
I 1
decree 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
commitment 1
shall 1
be 1
null 1
and 1
void 1
and 1
that 1
no 1
one 1
shall 1
be 1
bound 1
to 1
observe 1
it; 1
and 1
I 1
hereby 1
impose 1
the 1
penalty 1
of 1
excommunication 1
latae 1
sententiae 1
upon 1
those 1
who 1
violate 1
this 1
prohibition. 1

To 1
quote 1
Cajetan 1
on 1
this 1
point 1
(citations 1
taken 1
from 1
the 1
linked 1
article 1
by 1
Robert 1
Siscoe), 1
deposition 1
by 1
an 1
imperfect 1
council 1
is 1
appropriate 1
“when 1
one 1
or 1
more 1
Popes 1
suffer 1
uncertainty 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
their 1
election, 1
as 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
arisen 1
in 1
the 1
schism 1
of 1
Urban 1
VI 1
and 1
others. 1

Then, 1
lest 1
the 1
Church 1
be 1
perplexed, 1
those 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
who 1
are 1
available 1
have 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
judge 1
which 1
is 1
the 1
true 1
pope, 1
if 1
it 1
can 1
be 1
known, 1
and 1
if 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
known, 1
[it 1
has] 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
provide 1
that 1
the 1
electors 1
agree 1
on 1
one 1
or 1
another 1
of 1
them.” 1

I 0
am 0
not 0
saying 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
case 0
has 0
been 0
proven. 0

Rather, 0
what 0
I 0
am 0
saying 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
hypothetical 0
imperfect 0
council 0
could 0
determine 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
proven 0
and 0
act 0
accordingly, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
would 0
judge 0
any 0
resulting 0
deposition 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
manner 0
it 0
judges 0
the 0
deposition 0
of 0
Benedict 0
IX. 0

Another 0
ground 0
for 0
deposition—as 0
determined 0
by 0
the 0
imperfect 0
council, 0
not 0
any 0
of 0
us—would 0
be 0
that 0
Bergoglio 1
has 1
deposed 1
himself 1
by 1
promulgating 1
heresy, 1
fracturing 1
the 1
Church’s 1
universal 1
discipline 1
respecting 1
marriage 1
and 1
the 1
Eucharist, 1
and 1
undermining 1
the 1
teaching 1
of 1
even 1
his 1
own 1
immediate 1
predecessors 1
on 1
matters 1
of 1
fundamental 1
morality 1
upheld 1
by 1
the 1
Magisterium 1
for 1
two 1
millennia. 1

Surely 0
the 0
Church 0
cannot 0
be 0
without 0
any 0
remedy 0
for 0
a 1
Pope 1
who 1
relentlessly 1
attacks 1
her 1
very 1
foundations! 1

To 1
quote 1
Cajetan 1
again: 1
“Indeed 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
separate 1
herself 1
from 1
an 1
heretical 1
pope 1
according 1
to 1
divine 1
law. 1

Consequently, 1
it 1
has 1
the 1
right, 1
by 1
the 1
same 1
divine 1
law, 1
to 1
use 1
all 1
means 1
of 1
themselves 1
necessary 1
for 1
such 1
separation; 1
and 1
those 1
that 1
juridically 1
correspond 1
to 1
the 1
crime, 1
are 1
of 1
themselves 1
necessary”—meaning 1
the 1
resort 1
to 1
an 1
imperfect 1
council. 1

If 0
a 0
synod 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
declare 0
the 0
deposition 0
of 0
a 0
pope 0
in 0
1046, 0
why 0
not 0
an 0
imperfect 0
council 0
today—or, 0
for 0
that 0
matter, 0
another 0
synod? 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
argued 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
deposition 0
would 0
provoke 0
massive 0
schisms 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

But 0
that 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
that 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
common 0
good 0
has 0
done 0
so, 0
as 0
the 0
Great 0
Western 0
Schism 0
demonstrates. 0

And 1
are 1
we 1
not 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
schisms 1
already, 1
provoked 1
by 1
none 1
other 1
than 1
Bergoglio 1
himself, 1
whose 1
insane 1
drive 1
to 1
shatter 1
the 1
Church’s 1
bimillennial 1
discipline 1
has 1
produced 1
the 1
totally 1
unprecedented 1
situation 1
in 1
which 1
what 1
is 1
still 1
considered 1
mortally 1
sinful 1
in 1
one 1
diocese 1
is 1
an 1
imperative 1
of 1
“mercy” 1
in 1
another? 1

In 0
any 0
case, 0
this 0
much 0
is 0
certain: 0
barring 0
Bergoglio’s 0
conversion 0
and 0
reversal 0
of 0
course, 0
the 0
Church 0
cannot 0
abide 0
this 0
pontificate 0
any 0
longer. 0

One 0
way 0
or 0
another, 0
the 0
Church 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
repel 0
an 0
attacker 0
at 0
her 0
very 0
summit. 0

Either 1
the 1
human 1
element 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
will 1
act 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
means 1
which 1
seem 1
possible, 1
however 1
extraordinary, 1
or 1
Heaven 1
itself 1
will 1
intervene 1
in 0
a 0
manner 0
that 0
might 0
well 0
involve 0
a 0
divine 0
chastisement 0
due 0
to 0
the 1
negligence 1
of 1
time-serving 1
pastors 1
who 1
left 1
their 1
sheep 1
completely 1
undefended 1
against 1
the 1
wolves 1
who 1
preyed 1
upon 1
them, 1
including 0
the 1
wolf 1
the 1
cardinals 1
improvidently 1
elected 1
Pope. 1

Some 0
four 0
months 0
before 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò’s 0
testimony 0
Cardinal 0
Willem 0
Jacobus 0
Eijk, 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Utrecht, 0
Netherlands, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
liberal 0
territory 0
in 0
the 0
entire 0
Church, 0
protested 0
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
blatant 0
nod 0
to 0
intercommunion 0
with 0
Protestants 0
in 0
Germany 0
means 0
that 0
“the 1
bishops 1
and, 1
above 1
all, 1
the 1
Successor 1
of 1
Peter 1
fail 1
to 1
maintain 1
and 1
transmit 1
faithfully 1
and 1
in 1
unity 1
the 1
deposit 1
of 1
faith 1
contained 1
in 1
Sacred 1
Tradition 1
and 1
Sacred 1
Scripture” 1
and 0
that 0
the 0
situation 0
reminds 0
him 0
of 0
Article 0
675 0
of 0
the 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
which 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Church’s 0
“final 0
trial” 0
before 0
the 0
Second 0
Coming, 0
“that 0
will 0
shake 0
the 0
faith 0
of 0
many 0
believers… 0
[a] 0
‘mystery 0
of 0
iniquity’ 0
in 0
the 0
form 0
of 0
a 0
religious 0
deception 0
offering 0
men 0
an 0
apparent 0
solution 0
to 0
their 0
problems 0
at 0
the 0
price 0
of 0
apostasy 0
from 0
the 0
truth. 0

What 0
can 0
the 0
Church 0
do 0
when 0
confronted 0
by 0
a 1
Pope 1
who, 1
as 1
a 1
prominent 1
cardinal 1
declares 1
to 1
the 1
whole 1
world, 1
“fail[s] 1
to 1
maintain 1
and 1
transmit 1
faithfully 1
… 1
the 1
deposit 1
of 1
faith 1
contained 1
in 1

Tradition 1
and 1
Sacred 1
Scripture” 1
and 1
is 1
leading 1
“an 1
apostasy 1
from 1
the 1
truth”? 1

It 1
seems 1
absurd 1
to 0
argue 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
do 0
nothing 0
but 0
exhort 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
pray 0
and 0
do 0
penance 0
while 0
a 1
papal 1
malefactor, 1
treated 1
as 1
if 1
were 1
an 1
absolute 1
dictator, 1
is 0
allowed 0
to 0
continue 0
wreaking 1
havoc 1
upon 1
faith 1
and 1
morals 1
to 1
the 1
detriment 1
of 1
countless 1
souls, 1
without 0
the 0
least 0
impediment, 0

Intellihub’s 0

who 0
has 0
extensively 0
reported 0
on 0
the 0
entire 0

cover-up 0
since 0
the 0
beginning, 0
recently 0
found 0
that 0
at 0
around 0
the 0
1:27:54 0
mark 0
of 0
the 0
audio 0
file 0
you 0
can 0
clearly 0
hear 0
dispatch 0
describing 0
the 0
situation 0
to 0
first 0
responders 0
who 0
are 0
headed 0
in 0
that 0
direction. 0

“We 0
have 0
a 0

wife 0
at 0
this 0
event 0
who 0
is 0
pinned 0
down 0
behind 0
the 0
bar 0
at 0
Mandalay 0
Bay. 0

We 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
further 0
on 0

dispatch 0
frantically 0
notes. 0

“Batallion 0

at 0
the 0
bar, 0
we 0
currently 0
have, 0
another 0
active 0
shooter 0
up 0
there.” 0

After 0
being 0
asked 0
to 0
confirm 0
the 0
information, 0
dispatch 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
make 0
clear 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
specifically 0
speaking 0
about 0
the 0
bar 0
at 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
hotel 0
rather 0
than 0
anywhere 0
near 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
room 0
that 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
supposedly 0
operated 0
from. 0

“The 0
only 0
information 0
I 0
have 0
is 0
it’s 0
the 0
bar 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay,” 0
dispatch 0
continues 0
before 0
being 0
asked 0
if 0
the 0
shooter 0
was 0
pinned 0
down 0
or 0
“just 0
sheltering 0
right 0
now?” 0

Interestingly, 0
the 0
story 0
doesn’t 0
end 0
there, 0
as 0
Ambellas 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
piece, 0
author 0
and 0
entrepreneur 0
Grant 0
Cardone 0
was 0
actually 0
holding 0
an 0
investors 0
meeting 0
in 0
the 0
very 0
same 0
bar 0
shortly 0
before 0
the 0
attack 0
took 0
place. 0

The 0

left 0

seven 0
minutes 0
before 0

one 0

Slowly 1
but 1
surely 1
we 1
are 1
beginning 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
truth 1
about 1
the 1
horrific 1

come 1
to 1
light 1
despite 1
authorities 1
desperately 1
trying 1
to 1
prevent 1
it 1
from 1
reaching 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

Sadly, 1
the 1
picture 1
emerging 1
is 1
one 1
that 1
includes 1
a 1
shocking 1
amount 1
of 1
evidence 1
pointing 1
towards 1
a 1
classic 1
deep 1
state 1
false 1
flag 1
operation. 1

GERMANY, 0
February 0
8, 0
2018 0
(LifeSiteNews) 0
– 0
Cardinal 0
Paul 0
Josef 0
Cordes 0
criticized 0
fellow 0
German 0
Cardinal 0
Reinhard 0
Marx’s 0
suggestion 0
that 0
Catholic 0
priests 0
should 0
consider 0
“blessing” 0
same-sex 0
relationships 0
liturgically. 0

Marx’s 1
idea 1
“truly 1
seems 1
sacrilegious” 1
and 1
“ignores 1
the 1
clear 1
Revelation 1
of 1
God,” 1
Cordes 0
wrote 0
in 0
a 0
response 0
on 0
kath.net. 0

Dr. 0
Maike 0
Hickson 0
translated 0
it 0
at 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five. 0

“The 0
Church 0
is 0
in 0
its 0
pastoral 0
care 0
bound 0
to 0
Holy 0
Scripture 0
and 0
to 0
its 0
interpretation 0
through 0
the 0
Church’s 0
Magisterium,” 0
wrote 0
Cordes. 0

“Marx 0
does 0
not 0
even 0
mention 0
that 0
homosexuality 1
always 1
contradicts 1
the 1
Will 1
of 1
God,” 1
citing 1
church 1
teaching 1
through 1
the 1
centuries. 1

Rather 1
than 1
being 1
about 1
receiving 1
“God’s 1
assistance 1
for 1
themselves,” 1
those 1
engaging 1
in 1
sodomy 1
and 1
wishing 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
“blessed” 1
by 1
the 1
Church 1
“aim 1
with 1
their 1
request 1
at 1
the 1
recognition 1
and 1
acceptance 1
of 1
their 1
homosexual 1
way 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
its 1
ecclesial 1
valorization.” 1

The 1
Catechism 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
teaches 1
that 1
“under 1
no 1
circumstances” 1
can 1
homosexual 1
activity 1
“be 1
approved” 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
“intrinsically 1
disordered.” 1
Such 1
acts 1
are 1
“contrary 1
to 1
the 1
natural 1
law. 1

They 1
close 1
the 1
sexual 1
act 1
to 1
the 1
gift 1
of 1
life. 1

They 1
do 1
not 1
proceed 1
from 1
a 1
genuine 1
affective 1
and 1
sexual 1
complementarity” 1
(CCC 1
2357). 1

However, 0
Marx 0
said 0
on 0
February 0
3 0
that 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
need 0
“closer 0
pastoral 0
care” 0
and 0
“one 0
must 0
also 0
encourage 0
priests 0
and 0
pastoral 0
workers 0
to 0
give 0
people 0
in 0
concrete 0
situations 0
[of 0
homosexual 0
unions] 0
encouragement. 0

I 1
do 1
not 1
really 1
see 1
any 1
problems 1
there.” 1

Marx 0
is 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops’ 0
Conference. 0

As 0
LifeSiteNews 0
previously 0
reported, 0
Marx 0
also 0
said 0
“yes,” 0
he 0
could 0
imagine 0
the 0
creation 0
of 0
a 0
rite 0
for 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
to 0
be 0
blessed 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

This 0
“encouragement” 0
from 0
priests 0
which 0
he 0
called 0
for 0
might 0
include 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
“liturgical” 0
recognition 0
of 0
their 0
union. 0

But 0
“how 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
done 0
publicly, 0
in 0
a 0
liturgical 0
form,” 0
is 0
“another 0
question...that 0
is 0
where 0
one 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
reticent 0
and 0
also 0
reflect 0
upon 0
that 0
in 0
a 0
good 0
way.” 0

After 0
Catholic 0
News 0
Agency’s 0
initial 0
report 0
on 0
Marx’s 0
comments, 0
his 0
office 0
contacted 0
the 0
outlet 0
and 0
said 0
they 0
had 0
mistranslated 0
part 0
of 0
what 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
cardinal’s 0
office 0
sent 0
CNA 0
“a 0
request 0
for 0
correction 0
of 0
[its] 0
translation 0
of 0
the 0
interview 0
in 0
question, 0
expressing 0
concern 0
that 0
CNA's 0
translation 0
constitutes 0
a 0
false 0
reference 0
and 0
does 0
not 0
properly 0
reflect 0
the 0
position 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Marx.” 0

The 0
cardinal’s 0
office 0
maintains 0
that 0
rather 0
than 0
saying 0
“yes,” 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
of 0
liturgical 0
“blessing” 0
of 0
gay 0
unions, 0
he 0
answered 0
the 0
question 0
in 0
a 0
more 0
subtle 0
way 0
without 0
giving 0
an 0
explicit 0
“yes.” 0
However, 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops’ 0
Conference 0
doesn’t 0
seem 0
to 0
deny 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
his 0
statements 0
on 0
how 0
“one 0
must 0
encourage 0
priests” 0
to 0
give 0
encouragement 0
to 0
homosexual 0
couples, 0
which 0
could 0
include 0
public 0
blessings 0
that 0
would 0
take 0
a 0
“liturgical” 0
form. 0

The 0
cardinal’s 0
staff 0
asked 0
that 0
CNA 0
change 0
his 0
answer 0
about 0
liturgically 0
“blessing” 0
gay 0
unions 0
to: 0
“There 0
are 0
no 0
general 0
solutions 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
right, 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
pastoral 0
care 0
for 0
individual 0
cases, 0
and 0
that 0
applies 0
to 0
other 0
areas 0
as 0
well, 0
which 0
we 0
cannot 0
regulate, 0
where 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
sets 0
of 0
rules.” 0

Philadelphia 0
Archbishop 0
Charles 0
Chaput 0
has 0
also 0
spoken 0
out 0
against 0
Marx’s 0
proposal. 0

“Any 1
such 1
‘blessing 1
rite’ 1
would 1
cooperate 1
in 1
a 1
morally 1
forbidden 1
act, 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
sincere 1
the 1
persons 1
seeking 1
the 1
blessing,” 1
wrote 0
Chaput. 0

He 0
explained 0
such 1
a 1
“blessing” 1
would 1
encourage 1
people 1
to 1
continue 1
living 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
the 1
Church 1
considers 1
gravely 1
sinful 1
and 1
spiritually 1
damaging, 1
and 1
therefore 1
would 1
be 1
uncharitable. 1

“There 0
is 0
no 0
love 0
– 0
no 0
charity 0
– 0
without 0
truth, 0
just 0
as 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
real 0
mercy 0
separated 0
from 0
a 0
framework 0
of 0
justice 0
informed 0
and 0
guided 0
by 0
truth,” 0
he 0
wrote. 0

“Creating 0
confusion 0
around 0
important 0
truths 0
of 0
our 0
faith, 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
positive 0
the 0
intention, 0
only 0
makes 0
a 0
difficult 0
task 0
more 0
difficult.” 0

“There 0
are 0
two 0
principles 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
remember,” 0
Chaput 0
wrote. 0

“First, 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
treat 0
all 0
people 0
with 0
the 0
respect 0
and 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
they 0
deserve 0
as 1
children 1
of 1
God 1
with 1
inherent 1
dignity. 1

This 0
emphatically 0
includes 0
persons 0
with 0
same-sex 0
attraction. 0

Second, 0
there 1
is 1
no 1
truth, 1
no 1
real 1
mercy, 1
and 1
no 1
authentic 1
compassion, 1
in 1
blessing 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
that 1
leads 1
persons 1
away 1
from 1
God.” 1

“This 0
in 0
no 0
way 0
is 0
a 0
rejection 0
of 0
the 0
persons 0
seeking 0
such 0
a 0
blessing, 0
but 0
rather 0
a 0
refusal 0
to 0
ignore 0
what 0
we 0
know 0
to 0
be 0
true 0
about 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
marriage, 0
the 0
family, 0
and 0
the 0
dignity 0
of 0
human 0
sexuality,” 0
he 0
explained. 0

“Jesus 1
said 1
the 1
truth 1
will 1
make 1
us 1
free. 1

Nowhere 1
did 1
he 1
suggest 1
it 1
will 1
make 1
us 1
comfortable.” 1

Cordes 0
has 0
a 0
history 0

Uranium 0
One 0
Bombshell: 1
Evidence 0
of 0
Bribery, 0
Extortion, 0
Kickbacks, 0
Money 0
Laundering, 0
and 0
More! 0

Right 0
about 0
now 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
Clinton 0
camp 0
should 0
be 0
getting 0
very 1
nervous 1
about 0
the 0
ongoing 0
investigations 0
into 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal. 0

What 0
must 0
be 0
most 0
annoying 1
for 0
the 0
Clinton 0
team 0
is 0
that 0
these 0
investigations 0
all 0
started 0
as 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
undermine 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
and 0
continue 0
to 0
push 0
connections 0
between 0
Trump 0
and 0
Russia. 0

Now, 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
after 0
the 0
investigations 0
began, 0
it’s 0
looking 0
less 0
likely 0
than 0
ever 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
did 0
anything 0
wrong… 0
but 0
the 0
investigations 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
zeroing 0
in 0
on 0
key 0
Clinton 0
team 0
members 0
(including 0
the 0
Clintons 0
themselves). 0

On 0
Tuesday 0
night 0
Fox 0
News 0
Sean 0
Hannity 0
sat 0
down 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
the 0
exploding 0
scandal 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal, 0
and 0
what 0
it 0
could 0
mean 0
for 0
the 0
Clinton 0
family. 0

Hannity 0
spoke 0
with 0
investigative 0
reporter 0
Sara 0
Carter 0
of 0
Circa, 0
John 0
Solomon 0
of 0
The 0
Hill, 0
and 0
Victoria 0
Toensing, 0
an 0
attorney 0
representing 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant 0
who 0
allegedly 0
possesses 0
documents 0
on 0
the 0
sale 0
of 0
Canadian 0
mining 0
company 0
‘Uranium 0
One’ 0
to 0
Russia 0
interests 0
back 0
in 0
2010. 0

Now 0
that 0
the 0
NDA 0
(non 0
disclosure 0
agreement) 0
has 0
been 0
lifted 0
Circa’s 0
Sara 0
Carter 0
is 0
“reporting 0
that 0
she 0
has 0
received 0
a 0
treasure 0
trove 0
of 0
documents 0
that 0
in 0
fact 0
prove 0
tonight 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant 0
has 0
knowledge 0
of 0
Russia’s 0
involvement 0
in 0
uranium 0
one.” 0

Not 0
to 0
be 0
outdone, 0
the 0
Hill’s 0
John 0
Solomon 0
had 0
found 0
even 0
more 0
dirt 0
on 0
this 0
ugly 1
Clinton 0
led 0
deal. 0

Apparently, 0
Solomon 0
has 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant 0
“has 0
evidence, 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
inside, 0
directly 0
from 0
Putin’s 0
Russia, 0
the 0
push 0
for 0
nuclear 0
fuel 0
deals, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
crimes 0
we 0
talked 0
about, 0
bribery, 0
kickback, 0
extortion, 0
money 0
laundering, 0
racketeering, 0
all 0
knelt 0
corroborating 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
corroborated 0
even 0
further. 0

Go 0
into 0
your 0
report.” 0

This 0
is 0
all 0
about 0
to 0
get 0
very 1
ugly. 1

bombshell 1
reports 0
equally 0
tonight. 0

Solomon 0

according 0
to 0
the 0
memos 0
obtained, 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant 0
that 0
now 0
has 0
had 0
his 0
NDA 0
lifted 0
at 0
the 0
center 0
of 0
this 0
case 0
gathered 0
years 0
and 0
years 0
of 0
evidence 0
of 0
Russia’s 0
plot 1
to 0
control 1
U.S. 0
Nuclear 0
fuel, 0
which 0
included 0
the 0
uranium 0
one 0
deal. 0

And 0
Sara 0
Carter 0
reporting 0
that 0
she 0
has 0
received 0
a 0
treasure 0
trove 0
of 0
documents 0
that 0

Also 0
joining 0
us 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
attorney 0
for 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant, 0
Victoria 0
Toensing 0
along 0
with 0
John 0
and 0
Sara. 0

Sara, 0
let’s 0
start 0
with 0
your 0
report. 0

A 0
treasure 0
trove, 0
that 0
is 0
huge. 1

SARAH 0
CARTER, 0
CIRCA 0
NEWS: 0
It 0
is 0
Sean. 0

I 0
mean 0
there’s 0
over 0
5,000 0
documents 0
which 0
include 0
emails, 0
briefs, 0
other 0
documentation, 0
memorandums 0
that 0
the 0
informant 0
had 0
turned 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department, 0
and 0
within 0
these 0
documents, 0
it’s 0
very 0
evident 0
of 0
Russia’s 0
intention 0
to 0
enter 0
the 0
American 0
market, 0
energy 0
market. 0

And 0
their 0
intentions 0
to 0
acquire 0
uranium 0
one. 0

HANNITY: 0
John, 0
you 0
go 0
into 0
extensive 0
detail 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
and 0
hard-hitting 0
piece 0
tonight 0
and 0
revealing 0
piece, 0
how 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant 0
— 0
you 0
actually 0
said 0
six 0
years, 0
I 0
thought 0
he 0
was 0
only 0
an 0
informant 0
for 0
four 0
years. 0

He 0
has 0
evidence, 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
inside, 0
directly 0
from 0
Putin’s 0
Russia, 0
the 0
push 0
for 0
nuclear 0
fuel 0
deals, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
crimes 0
we 0
talked 0
about, 0
bribery, 0
kickback, 0
extortion, 0
money 0
laundering, 0
racketeering, 0
all 0
knelt 0
corroborating 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
corroborated 0
even 0
further. 0

Go 0
into 0
your 0
report. 0

JOHN 0
SOLOMON, 0
THE 0
HILL: 0
You 0
know, 0
Sara 0
just 0
said 0
something 0
about 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
the 0
dominance 0
of 0
the 0
uranium 0
market. 0

This 0
is 0
an 0
email 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
had 0
for 0
six 0
years. 0

It 0
shows 0
that 0
uranium 0
one 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
Russia 0
strategy 0
to 0
control, 1
not 0
just 0
benefit 0
from 0
the 0
global 0
market, 0
controlled 1
the 0
global 0
market. 0

That 0
would 0
put 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
at 0
a 0
disadvantage. 0

That 0
is 0
the 0
sort 0
of 0
evidence 0
that 0
this 0
FBI 0
informant 0
has 0
right 0
now. 0

If 0
you 0
go 0
back 0
on 0
the 0
last 0
week 0
we 0
heard 0
several 0
things 0
from 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department, 0
there’s 0
no 0
connection 0
to 0
uranium 0
one. 0

These 0
are 0
emails 0
that 0
say 0
uranium 0
one 0
that 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
FBI 0
files. 0

They 0
said 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
connection 0
between 0
the 0
uranium 0
one 0
case 0
and 0
the 0
criminal 0
case. 0

We 0
now 0
know 0
the 0
criminal 0
case 0
got 0
its 0
first 0
evidence 0
in 0
2009, 0
a 0
whole 0
year 0
before 0
the 0
uranium 0
one 0
deal 0
was 0
approved 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

There 0
are 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
things 0
that 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
saying 0
that 0
these 0
documents 0
simply 0
don’t 0
agree 0
with. 0

HANNITY: 0
All 0
right. 0

I 0
got 0
a 0
very 0
high 0
ranking 0
Congressman 0
and 0
that 0
knows, 0
let 0
us 0
put 0
it 0
that 0
way, 0
and 0
actually 0
sent 0
me 0
a 0
note. 0

The 0
knowledge 0
of 0
key 0
administration 0
officials 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
next 0
thing 0
proven 0
by 0
both 0
of 0
you, 0
and 0
the 0
links 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
foundation. 0

Sara, 0
is 0
that 0
true? 0

CARTER: 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
is 0
true. 0

I 0
mean 0
especially 0
when 0
we 0
at 0
— 0

HANNITY: 0
Do 0
believe 0
or 0
you 0
know? 0

I 0
can’t 0
ask 0
Victoria 0
that 0
question 0
because 0
she 0
won’t 0
tell 0
me. 0

CARTER: 0
I 0
know 0
it’s 0
true. 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
looking 0
at 0
these 0
documents 0
following 0
the 0
money, 0
following 0
the 0
money 0
is 0
what’s 0
important 0
here. 0

The 0
Justice 0
Department 0
has 0
not 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
possibly 0
call 0
a 0
special 0
counsel 0
to 0
this. 0

This 0
is 0
still 0
out 0
there. 0

They 0
are 0
looking 0
into 0
it. 0

That 0
is 0
something 0
that 0
they 0
need 0
to 0
decide. 0

But 0
whether 0
it’s 0
a 0
special 0
counsel 0
or 0
whether 0
it’s 0
a 0
prosecutor 0
that 0
is 0
investigating 0
this, 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
money. 0

There 0
are 0
somethings 0
said 0
… 0

HANNITY: 0
When 0
you 0
say 0
follow 0
the 0
money, 0
my 0
suspicion 0
would 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
money 0
came 0
directly 0
from 0
Russia, 0
was 0
funneled 0
through 0
the 0
Canadian 0
donors 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation. 0

How 0
good 0
are 0
my 0
instincts? 0

CARTER: 0
You 0
have 0
pretty 0
good 0
instincts. 0

I 0
think 0
there’s 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
other 0
areas 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
looking 0
at 0
as 0
well. 0

Remember 0
this 0
is 0
like 0
peeling 0
back 0
an 0
onion. 0

You 0
peel 0
one 0
part 0
and 0
then 0
you 0
find 0
another 0
part. 0

And 0
that 0
is 0
what’s 0
going 0
to 0
require 0
somebody 0
to 0
do 0
an 0
extensive 0
investigation. 0

HANNITY: 0
But 0
it 0
is 0
beginning 0
to 0
cascade 0
Sara. 0

CARTER: 0
It 0
is. 0

HANNITY: 0
John, 0
I 0
want 0
her 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
thing, 0
that 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation, 0
that 0
this 0
will 0
be 0
traced 0
back 0
to 0
high-ranking 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
and 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation, 0
and 0
if 0
you 0
add 0
the 0
money 0
portion 0
Sara 0
mentioned? 0

SOLOMON: 0
I 0
do. 0

I 0
think 0
the 0
place 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
talking 0
about 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
couple 0
weeks 0
as 0
the 0
Clinton 0
global 0
initiative. 0

Sort 0
of 0
a 0
side 0
project 0
of 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation. 0

There 0
are 0
new 0
flows 0
of 0
money 0
there 0
that 0
we 0
will 0
report 0
on 0
then 0
the 0
next 0
couple 0
of 0
weeks. 0

There 0
were 0
also 0
some 0
personal 0
business 0
projects, 0
some 0
very 0
senior 0
Clinton 0
people 0
that 0
got 0
a 0
remarkable 1
infusion 0
of 0
cash 0
from 0
Russia. 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
couple 0
of 0
weeks. 0

Another 0
layer 0
of 0
interest 0
of 0
the 0
story. 0

HANNITY: 0
All 0
right. 0

We 0
have 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
time 0
in 0
the 0
segment 0
so 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
go 0
very 0
slowly 0
here. 0

Both 0
of 0
you, 0
before 0
I 0
get 0
to 0
Victoria, 0
Sara 0
and 0
John, 0
you 0
both 0
in 0
your 0
pieces 0
said 0
5,000 0
documents. 0

I 0
hear 0
the 0
number 0
the 0
FBI 0
informant 0
is 0
much, 0
much 0
greater, 0
tens 0
of 0
thousands. 0

True 0
or 0
false? 0

SOLOMON: 0
That 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
accurate. 0

We 0
have 0
a 0
subset 0
of 0
the 0
documents 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
very 0
voluminous. 0

HANNITY: 0
Now 0
let 0
me 0
go 0
to 0
Victoria. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
great 0
attorneys. 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
difficult 0
to 0
get 0
any 0
information 0
out 0
of. 0

Victoria, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
I’ve 0
known 0
about 0
you, 0
and 0
I’ve 0
interviewed 0
you 0
so 0
many 0
times 0
over 0
the 0
years, 0
you 0
now 0
have 0
been 0
doing 0
a 0
deep 0
dive 0
into 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

You 0
are 0
now 0
representing 0
this 0
FBI 0
informant. 0

I 0
think 0
they 0
will 0
become 0
an 0
American 1
hero 1
out 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
this, 0
but 0
apparently, 0
he 0
was 0
fighting 0
and 0
begging 0
and 0
pleading 0
and 0
saying 0
the 0
Russians 0
are 0
here, 0
they 0
are 0
doing 0
this, 0
why 0
are 0
you 0
paying 0
attention? 0

I 0
hope 0
my 0
instincts 0
are 0
right 0
there, 0
and 0
number 0
two, 0
how 0
devastating 1
it 0
legally 0
is 0
this 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
just 0
asking 0
Sara 0
and 0
John 0
about 0
impacting 0
former 0
Obama 0
officials, 0
money, 0
Clinton 0
foundation? 0

VICTORIA 0
TOENSING, 0
ATTORNEY 0
REPRESENTING 0
FBI 0
INFORMANT: 0
Let 0
me 0
go 0
to 0
number 0
one 0
first, 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
whole 0
essence 0
of 0
what 0
John 0
and 0
Sara 0
and 0
I 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
is 0
that 0
in 0
2009, 0
2010, 0
our 0
FBI 0
and 0
presumably 0
our 0
Justice 0
Department, 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House, 0
as 0
my 0
client 0
was 0
told, 0
all 0
knew 0
about 0
this 0
corruption 0
in 0
the 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
energy 0
area. 0

There’s 0
no 0
separate 0
companies. 0

They 0
are 0
all 0
related. 0

The 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
energy 0
is 0
controlled 1
from 0
the 0
top, 0
from 0
Putin. 0

They 0
are 0
all 0
one. 0

They 0
all 0
talk 0
to 0
each 0
other. 0

So 0
the 0
evidence 0
about 0
this 0
corruption 0
was 0
known 0
to 0
our 0
government 0
in 0
2009, 0
2010, 0
and 0
why 0
is 0
it 0
that 0
CFIUS 0
either 0
wasn’t 0
told, 0
or 0
CFIUS 0
people 0
knowing 0
about 0
it 0
— 0

HANNITY: 0
Explain 0
CFIUS, 0
13 0
agencies, 0
I 0
am 0
sorry 0
9 0
agencies 0
approving 0
the 0
deal 0
that 0
gave 0
control 1
of 0
uranium 0
one 0
to 0
the 0
bad 1
actor, 1
hostile 1
regime, 1
Putin 0
Russia. 0

TOENSING: 0
They 0
said, 0
the 0
CFIUS 0
board 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
bad 1
Russians 0
could 0
buy 0
uranium 0
one, 0
which 0
contains 0
access 0
to 0
20 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0

Uranium, 0
why 0
was 0
that 0
decision 0
made? 0

Was 0
CFIUS 0
told? 0

Did 0
Bob 0
Mueller 0
go 0
to 0
Eric 0
Holder 0
and 0
tell 0
him? 0

Eric 0
Holder 0
sat 0
on 0
it. 0

HANNITY: 0
He 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
nine. 0

TOENSING: 0
Did 0
Bob 0
Mueller 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
and 0
tell 0
him? 0

The 0
FBI 0
agents 0
told 0
my 0
client 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
briefing 0
the 0
President 0
about 0
his 0
conduct. 0

Of 0
course, 0
when 0
the 0
CFIUS 0
decision 0
was 0
made. 0

My 0
client 0
said, 0
what 0
happened? 0

HANNITY: 0
Back 0
to 0
my 0
original 0
question, 0
counselor, 0
if 0
I 0
may. 0

You 0
are 0
too 0
good 0
at 0
your 0
job. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
serious 0
point. 0

Putting 0
your 0
legal 0
hat 0
on, 0
objectively 0
speaking, 0
yes 0
they 0
knew, 0
the 0
evidence 0
will 0
prove 0
it 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
documents 0
and 0
your 0
client, 0
crimes 0
committed 0
on 0
a 0
high 0
level? 0

National 0
security 0
compromise? 0

TOENSING: 0
Of 0
course, 0
it 0
goes 0
without 0
saying 0
giving 0
the 0
Russians 0
control 1
of 0
the 0
uranium 0
was 0
a 0
national 0
security 0
compromise. 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
continue 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
money 0
because 0
the 0
reporting 0
that 0
John 0
and 0
Sara 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
doing 0
in 0
a 0
few 0
days 0
will 0
be 0
revealing 0
about 0
where 0
lots 0
of 0
the 0
various 0
money 0
went 0
and 0
where 0
it 0
came 0
from. 0

HANNITY: 0
Always 0
we 0
go 0
back, 0
and 0
I 0
believe 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
this 0
you 0
guys 0
deserve 0
a 0
Pulitzer, 0
and 0
I’m 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
thinking 0
that. 0

You 0
have 0
dug 0
so 0
deep 0
on 0
this, 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
deep 0
dive 0
and 0
I 0
applaud 0
you 0
both. 0

I 0
want 0
to 0
ask 0
as 0
it 0
relates 0
to 0
who 0
knew 0
what, 0
and 0
when. 0

What 0
did 0
they 0
know, 0
when 0
did 0
they 0
know 0
it, 0
John 0
Solomon? 0

I’m 0
talking 0
about 0
Obama, 0
Mueller, 0
Eric 0
Holder, 0
and 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

SOLOMON: 0
We 0
are 0
at 0
a 0
little 0
disadvantage 0
right 0
now, 0
because 0
we 0
don’t 0
have 0
those 0
records, 0
and 0
also 0
the 0
records 0
that 0
Congress 0
needs 0
to 0
go 0
get, 0
but 0
I 0
can 0
tell 0
you 0
I 0
have 0
a 0
person 0
quoted 0
in 0
my 0
story 0
who 0
has 0
direct 0
knowledge 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
knew. 0

This 0
person 0
said 0
without 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
doubt, 1
we 0
knew 0
in 0
2009 0
a 0
year 0
before 0
CFIUS 0
ruled 0
that 0
Thomas 0
were 0
engaged 0
in 0
criminality, 0
without 1
a 1
shadow 1
of 1
a 1
doubt, 1
we 0
knew 0
that 0
Russia 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
gain 0
a 0
corner 0
on 0
the 0
U.S. 0
market, 0
get 0
a 0
strong 0
hold 0
on 0
our 0
uranium, 0
and 0
without 1
a 1
doubt 1
we 0
knew 0
they 0
were 0
using 0
political 0
levers 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
get 0
their 0
way 0
here. 0

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
control, 1
like 0
this 0
document 0
says, 0
they 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
gain 0
control 1
of 0
our 0
markets. 0

That 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
national 1
security 1
interest 0
that 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
raised 0
in 0
CFIUS. 0

HANNITY: 0
President 0
daily 0
briefings 0
were 0
told. 0

Had 0
this 0
information 0
in 0
it 0
before 0
CFIUS 0
approves 0
this. 0

CARTER: 0
Sean. 0

That 0
is 0
what 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
find 0
out. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
see 0
those 0
Presidential 0
daily 0
briefings. 0

Congress 0
can 0
get 0
those. 0

They 0
will 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
know 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
President 0
Obama 0
was 0
briefed 0
on 0
this 0
and 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
people 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
spoken 0
with 0
as 0
well, 0
he 0
was. 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
will 0
reveal 0
a 0
whole 0
other 0
layer 0
of 0
who 0
knew 0
what, 0
where 0
and 0
when. 0

And 0
we 0
follow 0
the 0
money 0
and 0
it 0
will 0
reveal 0
even 0
more 0
about 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
what 0
she 0
knew 0
and 0
when 0
did 0
she 0
know 0
it, 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
CFIUS 0
board. 0

HANNITY: 0
And 0
Obama 0
and 0
Holder 0
and 0
Mueller? 0

John, 0
real 0
quick, 0
we 0
are 0
running 0
out 0
of 0
time. 0

SOLOMON: 0
yes 0
listen, 0
I 0
think 0
even 0
Sessions 0
and 0
Rosenstein 0
have 0
questions 0
to 0
answer. 0

There 0
are 0
people 0
in 0
Congress 0
who 0
don’t 0
think 0
they’ve 0
gotten 0
a 0
straight 0
answer 0
from 0
them. 0

HANNITY: 0
All 0
right. 0

Victoria, 0
we 0
get 0
the 0
last 0
word 0
from 0
you, 0
laws 0
broken? 0

TOENSING: 0
Well, 0
of 0
course. 0

HANNITY: 0
You 0
are 0
so 0
good 0
at 0
your 0
job. 0

You 0
are 0
so 0
annoyingly 0
good. 0

The 0
American 1
people 1
deserve 0
the 0
truth 0
varied 0
our 0
security 0
was 0
compromised, 0
we 0
import 0
uranium, 0
because 0
we 0
don’t 0
have 0
enough. 0

Newt 0
Gingrich 0
will 0
weigh 0
in 0
on 0
this 0
and 0
more 0
things 0
and 0
about 0
the 0
Clintons. 0

Are 0
they 0
facing 0
their 0
day 0
of 0
reckoning? 0

And 0
a 0
big 0
announcement 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0

The 0
Death 0
Penalty, 0
Instituted 0
by 0
God 0
Himself 0
(The 0
Biblical 0
Basis 0
for 0
Catholic 0
Teaching 0
on 0
Capital 0

TO 1
ARGUE 1
AGAINST 1
THE 1
DEATH 1
PENALTY 1
is 1
to 1
contend 1
with 1
constituted 1
reality. 1

Ever 0
since 0
Adam 0
and 0
Eve 0
committed 0
the 0
Original 0
Sin, 0
every 0
living 0
creature 0
is 0
subject 0
to 0
it. 0

Every 1
one 1
of 1
us 1
is 1
born 1
on 1
Death 1
Row 1
and 1
lives 1
out 1
his 1
allotted 1
lifespan 1
in 1
its 1
shadow 1
without 1
hope 1
of 1
reprieve. 1

God 0
made 0
that 0
clear 0
when 0
He 0
told 0
Adam 0
that 0
“in 0
what 0
day 0
soever” 0
he 0
preferred 0
his 0
own 0
will 0
above 0
his 0
Creator’s, 0
“thou 1
shalt 1
die 1
the 1
death,” 1
condemning 0
him 0
sooner 0
or 0
later 0
to 0
“return 0
to 0
the 0
earth 0
out 0
of 0
which 0
thou 0
wast 0
taken: 0
for 0
dust 0
thou 0
art, 0
and 0
to 0
dust 0
thou 0
shalt 0
return” 0
(Gen. 0
3:19). 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
there 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
a 1
death 1
penalty. 1

God 1
instituted 1
it, 1
and 1
He 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
to 1
impose 1
it, 1
embedding 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
fabric 1
of 1
natural 1
law. 1

When 0
Cain 0
took 0
it 0
upon 0
himself 0
to 0
inflict 0
death 0
on 0
his 0
brother 0
Abel 0
“in 0
the 0
field,” 0
he 0
soon 0
learned 0
that 0
God 0
furthermore 0
reserved 0
the 0
exercise 0
of 0
this 0
right 0
to 0
himself 0
alone. 0

Cain 0
is 0
told, 0
“What 0
hast 0
thou 0
done? 0

The 0
voice 0
of 0
thy 0
brother’s 0
blood 0
crieth 0
to 0
me 0
from 0
the 0
earth,” 0
and 0
God 1
curses 1
him 1
for 0
his 0
presumption 0
by 0
dooming 1
him 1
to 0
homelessness 0
and 0
unproductive 0
labor. 0

When 0
Cain 0
complains 0
that 0
being 0
a 1
“vagabond 1
. 0

. 0

. 0

on 0
the 0
earth, 0
every 0
one 0
therefore 0
that 0
findeth 0
me, 0
shall 0
kill 0
me,” 0
God 0
laid 0
down 0
that 0
“whoever 0
shall 0
kill 0
Cain 0
shall 0
be 0
punished 1
sevenfold,” 1
setting 0
a 0
mysterious 0
identifying 0
mark 0
on 0
him 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
from 0
the 0
vengeance 0
of 0
others. 0

The 0
Fifth 0
Commandment 0
later 0
delivered 0
to 0
Moses, 0
“Thou 0
shalt 0
not 0
kill,” 0
therefore 0
dates 0
from 0
adamic 0
times, 0
when 0
it 0
operated 0
as 0
God’s 0
exclusive 0
prerogative, 0
allowing 0
no 0
exceptions. 0

Although 0

men 0
certainly 0
continued 0
to 0
kill 0
one 0
another 0
in 0
a 0
society 0
which 0
in 0
fact 0
became 0
so 1
wicked 1
"that 0
all 0
the 0
thought 0
of 0
their 0
heart 0
was 0
bent 0
upon 0
evil 0
at 0
all 0
times," 0
they 0
did 0
so 0
as 0
murderers, 0
outside 0
God's 0
law 0
without 0
legal 0
right. 0

Only 0
after 0
the 0
Flood, 0
when 0
Noah 0
and 0
his 0
sons 0
set 0
about 0
repopulating 0
the 0
earth, 0
did 0
God 0
delegate 0
to 0
human 0
society 0
His 0
exclusive 0
authority 0
to 0
impose 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
for 0
just 0
cause. 0

He 0
told 0
Noah, 0
“For 0
I 0
will 0
require 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
your 0
lives 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
every 0
beast, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
man, 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
every 0
man, 0
and 0
of 0
his 0
brother, 0
will 0
I 0
require 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
man. 0

Whosoever 0
shall 0
shed 0
man’s 0
blood, 0
his 0
blood 0
shall 0
be 0
shed: 0
for 0
man 0
was 0
made 0
to 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
God.” 0
In 0
other 0
words, 0
from 1
that 1
point 1
in 1
history 1
lawful 1
killing 1
in 1
atonement 1
for 1
taking 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
another 1
is 1
sanctioned 1
by 1
God. 1

After 0

the 0
great 0
theophany 0
on 0
Sinai, 0
Moses 0
codified 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
old 0
law 0
of 0
talion, 0
which 0
in 0
strict 0
justice 0
required 0
“life 1
for 1
life, 1
eye 1
for 1
eye, 1
tooth 1
for 1
tooth, 1
hand 1
for 1
hand, 1
foot 1
for 1
foot” 1
(Deut. 0

19:21). 0

The 0
supreme 0
penalty 0
was 0
imposed 0
not 0
only 0
for 0
murder, 0
but 0
for 0
many 0
other 0
serious 0
offenses: 0
for 0
adultery, 0
rape, 0
sodomy, 0
kidnapping, 0
for 0
striking 0
or 0
cursing 0
parents, 0
for 0
sacrificing 0
a 0
child 0
to 0
Moloch. 0

Idolatry, 0
fortune-telling, 0
acting 0
as 0
a 0
medium, 0
preaching 0
apostasy 0
or 0
attempting 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
to 0
entice 0
another 0
from 0
the 0
faith 0
were 0
also 0
punishable 0
by 0
death, 0
as 0
was 0
blasphemy, 0
an 0
offense 0
considered 0
so 1
heinous 1
that 0
the 0
Law 0
specified, 0
“He 0
that 0
blasphemeth 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Lord, 0
dying 0
let 0
him 0
die: 0
all 0
the 0
multitude 0
shall 0
stone 0
him, 0
whether 0
he 0
be 0
a 0
native 0
or 0
a 0
stranger” 0
(Lev. 0

24:16). 0

Death 0
was 0
also 0
decreed 0
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0
priests 0
in 0
a 0
legal 0
case, 0
and 0
an 0
incorrigible 0
son 0
could 0
be 0
put 0
to 0
death 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
his 0
parents 0
before 0
the 0
proper 0
court. 0

A 0

priest’s 0
daughter 0
convicted 0
of 0
fornication 0
was 0
burned 0
to 0
death 0
(Lev. 0

21:9), 0
but 0
usually 0
the 0
sentence 0
was 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
stoning, 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
whole 0
community 0
took 0
part 0
as 0
evidence 0
that 0
no 0
private 0
parties 0
were 0
authorized 0
to 0
execute 0
a 0
criminal, 0
but 0
only 0
society 0
as 0
a 0
whole, 0
after 0
due 0
judgment. 0

Everyone 0
was 0
furthermore 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
atonement 0
due 0
to 0
God 0
for 0
a 0
crime 0
whose 0
evil 0
consequences 0
would 0
otherwise 0
have 0
affected 0
them 0
all: 0
“The 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
witnesses 0
shall 0
be 0
first 0
upon 0
him 0
to 0
kill 0
him, 0
and 0
afterwards 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
people; 0
that 0
thou 0
mayest 0
take 0
away 0
the 0
evil 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
thee” 0
(Deut. 0

17:7). 0

The 0
Law 0
read, 0
“Defile 0
not 0
the 0
land 0
of 0
your 0
habitation 0
which 0
is 0
stained 0
with 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
the 0
innocent: 0
neither 0
can 0
it 0
otherwise 0
be 0
expiated, 0
but 0
by 0
his 0
blood 0
that 0
hath 0
shed 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
another” 0
(Num. 0

35:33). 0

In 0

order 0
to 0
emphasize 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
God, 0
and 0
not 0
man, 0
who 0
is 0
always 0
the 0
principal 0
party 0
to 0
be 0
avenged, 0
provision 0
was 0
made 0
for 0
a 0
heifer 0
to 0
be 0
killed 0
as 0
propitiation 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
an 0
unsolved 0
murder 0
whose 0
perpetrator 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
found 0
(Deut. 0

20:1-9). 0

After 1
all, 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
injury 1
to 1
relatives 1
or 1
any 1
other 1
human 1
consideration 1
that 1
makes 1
homicide 1
the 1
serious 1
sin 1
that 1
it 1
is, 1
but 1
as 1
God 1
Himself 1
pointed 1
out 1
to 1
Noah, 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
“man 1
was 1
made 1
to 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
God” 1
that 1
makes 1
an 1
assault 1
on 1
him 1
tantamount 1
to 1
an 1
assault 1
on 1
God. 1

It 1
is 1
therefore 1
to 1
God, 1
and 1
not 1
to 1
His 1
creatures 1
that 1
reparation 1
is 1
primarily 1
due. 1

This 0
point 0
was 0
brought 0
out 0
by 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
in 0
an 0
address 0
to 0
Italian 0
Catholic 0
jurists 0
on 0
May 0
12, 0
1954, 0
when 0
he 0
said: 0

A 0
penalty 0
is 0
the 0
reaction 0
required 0
by 0
law 0
and 0
justice 0
in 0
response 0

Most 0
of 0
the 0
modern 0
theories 0
of 0
penal 0
law 0
explain 0
penalty 0
and 0
justify 0
it 0
in 0

analysis 0
as 0
a 0
means 0
of 0
protection, 0

time 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
bring 0
the 0
offender 0
to 0
observance 0
of 0

In 0
those 0
theories, 0
the 0
penalty 0
can 0
include 0
sanctions 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
diminution 0
of 0

goods 0
guaranteed 0
by 0

to 0
teach 0
the 0

those 0
theories 0
fail 0
to 0
consider 0
the 0
expiation 0
of 0
the 0
crime 0
committed, 0
which 0
penalizes 0
the 0
violation 0

In 0
the 0
metaphysical 0
order, 0
penalty 0
is 0
a 0
consequence 0
of 0
dependence 0
on 0
the 0
supreme 0
will, 0
dependence 0
which 0
exists 0
in 0
the 0
deepest 0
recesses 0
of 0
created 0
being. 0

If 0
it 0
is 0
ever 0
necessary 0
to 0
hold 0
back 0
the 0
revolt 0
of 0
the 0
free 0
being 0
and 0
re-establish 0
the 0
violated 0

it 0
is 0
when 0
that 0
is 0
required 0
by 0
the 0
supreme 0
Judge 0
and 0
supreme 0
Justice. 0

Today 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
is 0
imposed 0
ever 0
more 0
rarely, 0
even 0
in 0
cases 0
of 0
proven 0
premeditated 0
murder. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 1
was 1
instituted 1
by 1
God 1
Himself, 1
growing 0
numbers 0
of 0
Catholics 0
actually 0
consider 0
it 0
immoral. 0

John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
stopping 0
just 0
short 0
of 0
declaring 0
it 0
wrong 0
in 0
principle, 0
has 0
declared 0
that 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
imposed 0
very 0
seldom, 0
if 0
ever. 0

But 0
doesn’t 0
admitting 0
the 0
penalty 0
in 0
principle 0
demand 0
that 0
it 0
be 0
put 0
into 0
practice? 0

In 0
the 0
U.S., 0
following 0
the 0
lead 0
of 0
the 0
late 0
Cardinal 0
Bernardin 0
of 0
Chicago 0
and 0
like 0
minded 0
prelates 0
won 0
to 0
the 1
new 1
man-centered 1
conciliar 1
religion, 1
the 0
faithful 0
are 0
beginning 0
to 0
equate 0
abortion, 0
nuclear 0
war 0
and 0
capital 0
punishment 0
as 0
common 0
“threats 1
to 1
the 1
sacredness 1
of 1
human 1
life” 1
without 0
any 0
reference 0
whatever 0
to 0
the 0
innocence 0
or 0
guilt 0
involved. 0

If 0
they 0
are 0
aware 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
upheld 0
from 0
Apostolic 0
times 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
use 0
force 0
in 0
self-defense, 0
to 0
kill 0
in 0
a 0
just 0
war 0
and 0
to 0
inflict 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
on 0
those 0
duly 0
judged 0
guilty 0
of 0
serious 0
crime, 0
they 0
now 0
apparently 0
subscribe 0
to 0
the 0
notion 0
propagated 0
by 0
Dei 0
Verbum 0
at 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
that 0
the 0
unchanging 0
Catholic 0
“tradition 0
which 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
Apostles” 0
actually 0
“develops 0
in 0
the 0
Church” 0
and 0
keeps 0
pace 0
with 0
changing 0
times 0
(II,8). 0

The 0

circumstances 0
pertaining 0
to 0
our 0
day 0
would 0
therefore 0
dictate 0
a 0
reassessment 0
of 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
which 0
the 1
new 1
man-centered 1
theology 1
insists 0
on 0
viewing 0
almost 0
exclusively 0
from 0
the 0
standpoint 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
and 0
human 0
society 0
rather 0
than 0
from 0
God’s. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
there 0
is 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
discussion 0
about 0
society’s 0
responsibility 0
for 0
having 0
produced 0
criminals 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
together 0
with 0
our 0
moral 0
obligation 0
to 0
rehabilitate 0
them 0
rather 0
than 0
to 0
wreak 0
what 0
is 0
now 0
considered 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
fruitless, 1
guilty 1
“vengeance” 1
on 0
them. 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
man 0
is 0
by 0
nature 0
good 0
and 0
perfectible 0
is 0
allowed 0
to 0
override 0
all 0
documented 0
evidence 0
that 0
hardened 0
criminals 0
are 0
in 0
fact 0
almost 0
impossible 0
to 0
rehabilitate 0
and 0
that 0
those 0
handed 0
life 0
sentences 0
rarely 0
repent 0
of 0
their 0
wrongdoing. 0

According 0

to 0
one 0
widely 0
held 0
opinion, 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
has 0
proved 0
to 0
be 0
no 0
effective 0
deterrent 0
to 0
crime 0
in 0
any 0
case, 0
and 0
should 0
be 0
discarded 0
as 0
impractical. 0

What 1
proof 1
of 1
this 1
can 1
possibly 1
be 1
offered? 1

How 1
can 1
we 1
know? 1

Deterrence 0
from 0
evil 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
primary 0
purpose 0
of 0
meting 0
out 0
punishment 0
in 0
any 0
case, 0
yet 0
Scripture 0
attests 0
to 0
deterrence 0
as 0
an 0
important 0
side 0
effect 0
of 0
any 0
penalty. 0

To 0
a 0
man 0
proven 0
to 0
have 0
given 0
false 0
witness 0
against 0
another, 0
Deuteronomy 0
laid 0
down, 0
“They 0
shall 0
render 0
to 0
him 0
as 0
he 0
meant 0
to 0
do 0
to 0
his 0
brother. 0

. 0

. 0

that 0
others 0
hearing 0
may 0
fear 0
and 0
may 0
not 0
dare 0
to 0
do 0
such 0
things. 0

Thou 0
shalt 0
not 0
pity 0
him, 0
but 0
shalt 0
require 0
life 1
for 1
life, 1
eye 1
for 1
eye, 1
tooth 1
for 1
tooth, 1
hand 1
for 1
hand, 1
foot 1
for 1
foot” 1
(Deut. 0

19:19-21). 0

And 0
the 0
Preacher 0
notes 0
that 0
when 1
“sentence 1
is 1
not 1
speedily 1
pronounced 1
against 1
the 1
evil, 1
the 1
children 1
of 1
men 1
commit 1
evils 1
without 1
any 1
fear” 1
(Eccles. 0

8:11). 0

To 0

illustrate 0
how 1
shallow 1
Catholic 1
thinking 1
on 1
the 1
death 1
penalty 1
has 1
become 1
and 1
how 1
far 1
it 1
has 1
deviated 1
from 1
the 1
age-old 1
doctrine 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
a 0
priest 0
of 0
a 0
presumably 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
Fraternity 0
writes 0
in 0
answer 0
to 0
a 0
query 0
addressed 0
to 0
him 0
on 0
the 0
subject 0
by 0
saying: 0

The 0
death 0
penalty 0
is 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
common 0
teachings 0
of 0
theologians, 0
but 0
is 0
not 0
itself 0
a 0
declared 0
dogma. 0

Therefore 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
permissible 0
to 0
call 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
it 0
is, 0
immoral 1
heretics. 1

To 0
approach 0
this 0
as 0
a 0
dogmatic 0
teaching 0
is 0
imprudent. 1

Those 0
who 0
argue 0
for 0
its 0
abolition 0
do 0
not 0
necessarily 0
put 0
society 0
in 0
danger 0
considering 0
possibilities 0
of 0
penal 0
systems. 0

Those, 0
however, 0
who 0
maintain 0
its 0
continued 0
use 0
often 0
see 0
it 0
more 0
as 0
a 1
tool 1
for 1
revenge. 1

Please 0
consider 0
that 0
in 0
anger 0
and 0
tragedy, 0
the 0
desire 0
for 0
revenge 0
usually 0
overrides 0
reason 0
and 0
an 0
honest 0
answering 0
of 0
the 0
question 0
“must 0
this 0
person’s 0
life 0
be 0
taken 0
to 0
preserve 0
society?” 0
The 1
desire 1
for 1
swift 1
and 1
firm 1
convictions 1
has 1
sent 1
many 1
to 1
death 1
who 1
never 1
deserved 1
such 1
a 1
punishment, 1
nor 1
was 1
such 1
a 1
punishment 1
truly 1
necessary 1
for 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
society. 1

I 0
do 0
not 0
believe 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
is 0
necessary 0
in 0
90 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
cases 0
where 0
it 0
is 0
applied. 0

Thus 0
to 0
call 0
for 0
a 0
moratorium 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

is 0
not 0
unjust 0
or 0
incorrect. 0

That 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
can 0
become 0
an 0
instrument 0
of 0
revenge, 0
and 0
that 0
unjust 0
sentences 0
are 0
sometimes 0
handed 0
down 0
can 0
be 0
dismissed 0
as 0
irrelevant 0
to 0
the 0
argument. 0

Given 0
the 1
fallen 1
human 1
condition, 1
such 1
injustices 1
are 1
bound 1
to 1
occur 1
in 1
any 1
judicial 1
system, 1
and 0
everyone 0
agrees 0
that 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
ruthlessly 1
remedied. 1

What 0
is 0
not 0
irrelevant 0
is 0
that 0
the 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
letter 1
falls 1
headlong 1
into 1
the 1
very 1
error 1
Pius 1
XII 1
warns 1
against. 1

Considering 0
the 0
physical 0
safety 0
of 0
society 0
as 0
the 0
only 0
real 0
reason 0
for 0
executing 0
a 0
criminal, 0
he 0
feels 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
can 0
now 0
be 0
safely 0
discarded, 0
allegedly 0
on 0
the 0
grounds 0
that 0
we 0
now 0
have 0
at 0
our 0
disposal 0
many 0
better 0
ways 0
of 0
protecting 0
people 0
from 0
him. 0

That 0
the 0
penalty 0
is 0
due 0
primarily 0
as 0
expiation 0
to 0
God 0
in 0
justice, 0
and 0
only 0
secondarily 0
to 0
man 0
has 0
been 0
lost 0
sight 0
of 0
altogether. 0

The 1
supernatural 1
dimension 1
of 1
the 1
punishment 1
as 0
an 0
agent 0
for 0
the 1
spiritual 1
good 1
of 0
both 0
society 0
and 0
the 0
criminal 0
is 0
furthermore 0
not 0
only 0
not 0
addressed, 0
but 0
treated 0
as 0
non-existent. 0

This 0
first 0
appeared 0
in 0
The 0
Remnant 0
nearly 0
20 0
years 0
ago. 0

Isn't 0
it 0
time 0
to 0
subscribe 0
to 0
the 0
'paper 0
of 0
record' 0
for 0
the 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
counterrevolution? 0

The 0

source 0
of 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
materialistic 0
thinking 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
not 0
hard 0
to 0
trace. 0

According 0
to 0
statistics 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
National 0
Review 0
for 0
September 0
16, 0
1983, 0
out 0
of 0
9,140 0
murders 0
committed 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
in 0
1960 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
Council, 0
56 0
persons 0
were 0
executed. 0

In 0
1965, 0
the 0
year 0
the 0
Council 0
closed, 0
although 0
the 0
tally 0
of 0
murders 0
had 0
risen 0
to 0
9,850, 0
only 0
7 0
were 0
executed. 0

In 0
the 0
decade 0
from 0
1967 0
to 0
1977 0
a 0
moratorium 0
was 0
declared 0
during 0
which 0
not 0
one 0
single 0
execution 0
took 0
place. 0

At 0
its 0
close 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
murders 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
doubled, 0
and 0
in 0
any 0
six 0
month 0
period, 0
more 0
Americans 0
were 0
being 0
murdered 0
than 0
those 0
executed 0
during 0
the 0
whole 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
century. 0

At 0
this 0
point, 0
although 0
the 0
murder 0
rate 0
has 0
continued 0
to 1
rise 1
dramatically, 1
executions 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
rare. 0

Many 0
nations, 0
notably 0
England, 0
France, 0
Sweden, 0
South 0
Africa 0
and 0
our 0
neighbors 0
Canada 0
and 0
Mexico, 0
have 1
abolished 1
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
altogether. 0

Whether 0
or 0
not 0
the 0
U. 0
S. 0
will 0
follow 0
suit 0
and 0
outlaw 0
it 0
nationally 0
still 0
remains 0
to 0
be 0
seen. 0

What 0

leaps 1
to 1
the 1
eye 1
from 0
the 0
mounting 0
statistics 0
is 0
that 0
decline 0
in 0
the 0
exercise 0
of 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
has 0
kept 0
close 0
pace 0
with 0
decline 0
in 0
the 0
Faith 0
and 0
church 0
attendance. 0

It 0
is 0
sober 0
fact 0
that 0
death 0
sentences 0
were 0
liberally 0
handed 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
heyday 0
of 0
Christendom, 0
when 0
the 0
Faith 0
was 0
strong 0
and 0
governments 0
legislated 0
with 0
an 0
eye 0
to 0
the 1
spiritual 1
welfare 1
of 1
citizens 1
whose 0
sights 0
were 0
primarily 0
on 0
future 1
bliss 1
in 1
heaven. 1

In 0
modern 0
times, 0
which 0
find 0
the 0
Church 0
strictly 0
separated 0
from 0
the 0
state 0
on 0
principle 0
and 0
denied 0
any 0
active 0
part 0
in 0
civil 0
government, 0
secularism 0
has 0
become 0
the 0
state 0
religion, 0
directing 0
legislation 0
exclusively 0
to 0
temporal 0
objectives. 0

It 0
is 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
expected 0
that 0
materialists—for 0
whom 0
the 0
immortal 0
soul 0
does 0
not 0
exist 0
and 0
who 0
believe 0
that 0
this 0
present 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
senses 0
on 0
earth 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
man 0
has—should 0
be 0
reluctant 0
to 0
punish 0
anyone 0
by 0
killing 0
him. 0

In 0
their 0
eyes 0
this 0
means 0
total 1
extinction, 1
a 0
penalty 0
certainly 0
in 0
excess 0
of 0
any 0
transgression 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
guilty. 0

Not 0

even 0
God 0
completely 1
obliterates 1
a 0
human 0
existence, 0
not 0
even 0
for 0
the 0
most 1
odious 1
sins, 1
for 0
He 0
made 0
the 0
human 0
soul 0
immortal 0
and 0
hell 0
eternal. 0

(It 0
might 0
be 0
argued, 0
however, 0
that 0
if 0
the 0
criminal 0
is 0
thought 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
have 0
totally 1
terminated 1
his 0
victim, 0
why 0
not 0
do 0
the 0
same 0
to 0
him?) 0

In 0
the 0
days 0
of 0
Christendom, 0
condemned 0
criminals 0
were 0
given 0
every 0
opportunity 0
to 0
make 0
their 0
peace 0
with 0
God, 0
in 0
many 0
cases 0
the 0
date 0
of 0
execution 0
being 0
delayed 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
accomplish 0
this 0
purpose. 0

Justice 0
was 0
served, 0
but 0
not 0
at 0
the 0
expense 0
of 0
charity, 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
question 0
of 0
taking 0
vengeance 0
on 0
the 0
culprit. 0

Nor 0
was 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
“rehabilitation” 0
with 0
possible 0
re-entry 0
into 0
society 0
ever 0
entertained 0
where 0
crimes 0
deserving 0
death 0
were 0
concerned. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
noted 0
by 0
prison 0
chaplains 0
in 0
our 0
century 0
that 0
swift 0
execution 0
in 0
most 0
cases 0
leads 0
to 0
admission 0
of 0
guilt 0
and 0
sincere 0
repentance, 0
whereas 0
those 0
who 0
receive 0
life 0
sentences 0
or 0
suffer 0
long 0
delays 0
are 0
likely 0
to 0
maintain 0
their 0
innocence 0
in 0
hopes 0
of 0
a 0
parole 0
and 0
eventually 0
die 0
in 0
their 0
sins. 0

As 0

it 0
is, 0
the 1
death 1
penalty 1
as 1
administered 1
by 1
society 1
must 1
be 1
viewed 1
against 1
the 1
backdrop 1
of 1
divine 1
revelation 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
make 1
any 1
real 1
sense. 1

When 0
Catholic 0
society 0
puts 0
a 0
man 0
to 0
death, 0
it 1
terminates 1
only 1
his 1
temporal 1
life 1
on 1
earth, 1
catapulting 1
him 1
into 1
eternity 1
for 1
his 1
final 1
judgment 1
before 1
almighty 1
God. 1

Suffering 1
the 1
penalty 1
not 1
only 1
allows 1
the 1
criminal 1
to 1
render 1
expiation 1
to 1
God 1
and 1
to 1
society, 1
but 1
if 1
accepted 1
in 1
Christ’s 1
grace 1
with 1
due 1
repentance, 1
it 1
preserves 1
his 1
soul 1
from 1
hell 1
and 1
eliminates 1
much 1
of 1
his 1
purgatory. 1

If 0
his 0
contrition 0
is 0
perfect, 0
it’s 0
conceivable 0
that 0
he 0
could 0
go 0
straight 0
to 0
heaven! 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
neither 0
he 0
nor 0
society 0
is 0
any 0
longer 0
burdened 0
with 0
the 0
guilt 0
of 0
his 0
wrongdoing. 0

As 0

Michel 0
Martin 0
pointed 0
out 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
in 0
Rome 0
et 0
d’Ailleurs 0
for 0
September-October 0
1983, 0
“The 0
truth 0
is 0
that 0
the 1
problem 1
of 1
the 1
death 1
penalty 1
is 1
insoluble 1
except 1
from 1
a 1
Christian 1
point 1
of 1
view.” 1
That 0
it 0
figured 0
so 0
prominently 0
in 0
Christian 0
societies 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that, 0
in 0
the 0
order 0
of 0
charity, 0
atonement 0
to 0
God 0
was 0
sought 0
above 0
any 0
atonement 0
due 0
to 0
man, 0
and 0
the 1
spiritual 1
welfare 1
of 1
citizens 1
above 0
their 0
physical 0
well-being. 0

Modern 1
secularized 1
society 1
assumes 0
that 0
physical 1
extinction 1
is 0
the 0
worst 0
thing 0
that 0
can 0
happen 0
to 0
a 0
human 0
being, 0
whereas 0
the 1
faith 1
teaches 1
that 1
eternal 1
damnation 1
is 1
incalculably 1
worse. 1

In 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
faith, 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
a 0
man’s 0
present 0
short 0
life 0
on 0
earth 0
cannot 1
be 1
compared 1
with 1
his 1
future 1
endless 1
existence 1
in 1
heaven. 1

+++ 0

As 0
we 0
have 0
seen, 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
has 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
history. 0

Dating 0
from 0
its 0
institution 0
by 0
God 0
in 0
Eden 0
to 0
its 0
delegation 0
after 0
the 0
Flood 0
to 0
men 0
who 0
would 0
wield 0
it 0
in 0
God’s 0
name, 0
it 0
has 0
threaded 0
its 0
way 0
without 0
interruption 0
through 1
the 1
fabric 1
of 1
human 1
civilizations 1
until 0
these 0
latter 0
days. 0

One 0
might 0
expect 0
that 0
after 0
the 0
Incarnation, 0
when 0
God 0
became 0
man 0
and 0
replaced 0
the 0
Old 0
Testament’s 0
law 0
of 0
talion 0
based 0
on 0
strict 0
justice 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
dispensation 0
based 0
on 0
love 0
and 0
grace, 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
could 0
be 0
safely 0
abolished 1
as 0
outmoded. 0

Converts 1
to 1
the 1
prevailing 1
conciliar 1
religion 1
and 1
its 1
“New 1
Pentecost” 1
would 0
in 0
fact 0
argue 0
in 0
this 0
wise, 0
perhaps 0
citing 0
the 0
Council’s 0
famous 0
declaration 0
in 0
Gaudium 0
et 0
Spes 0
that, 0
“Thanks 0
to 0
the 0
experience 0
of 0
past 0
ages 0
...the 0
nature 0
of 0
man 0
himself 0
is 0
more 0
clearly 0
revealed 0
and 0
new 0
roads 0
to 0
truth 0
are 0
opened,” 0
and 0
the 0
world 0
now 0
has 0
“a 0
keener 0
awareness 0
of 0
human 0
dignity” 0
( 0
44, 0
73). 0

Far 0

from 0
obliterating 1
the 1
death 1
penalty, 1
however, 0
the 0
Incarnation 0
only 0
laid 0
bare 0
its 0
deepest 0
significance, 0
hidden 0
from 0
the 0
beginning. 0

As 0
the 0
new 0
dispensation’s 0
foremost 0
theologian, 0
St. 0
Paul 0
would 0
declare, 0
the 0
old 0
penalty 0
remained 0
very 0
much 0
in 0
force: 0
“Almost 0
all 0
things, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
law, 0
are 0
cleansed 0
with 0
blood: 0
and 0
without 1
the 1
shedding 1
of 1
blood 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
remission.” 1
It 0
is 0
still 0
“appointed 0
for 0
men 0
once 0
to 0
die, 0
and 0
after 0
this 0
the 0
judgment” 0
(Heb. 0

9: 0
22,27), 0
but 0
now 0
with 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
eternal 1
bliss 1
in 1
heaven. 1

This 0
possibility 0
is 0
owed, 0
furthermore, 0
to 0
a 0
death 0
by 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
cruelest 1
means 1
ever 1
devised, 1
unjustly 0
inflicted 0
on 0
one 0
supremely 0
innocent 0
Man 0
who 0
was 0
God, 0
in 0
a 1
miscarriage 1
of 1
human 1
justice 1
beyond 1
any 1
the 1
world 1
could 1
ever 1
have 1
imagined. 1

When 0
God 0
set 0
the 0
death 0
penalty 0
in 0
Eden 0
He 0
pronounced 0
it 0
on 0
Himself, 0
to 0
be 0
carried 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
fullness 0
of 0
time 0
through 0
the 0
malicious 0
free 0
wills 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
creatures. 0

The 0
Cross 0
which 0
was 0
its 0
instrument 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
sign 0
of 0
Christianity, 0
the 0
only 0
means 0
of 0
salvation. 0

Not 0

even 0
from 0
the 0
Cross 0
did 0
Christ 0
decry 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
either 0
for 0
himself 0
or 0
for 0
the 0
two 0
thieves 0
crucified 0
with 0
Him. 0

It 0
would 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
dealt 0
out 0
to 0
men 0
by 0
other 0
men 0
on 0
earth, 0
with 0
only 0
one 0
significant 0
change: 0
Henceforth 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
administered 0
under 0
the 0
authority 0
of 0
the 1
glorified 1
man 1
who 1
is 1
Christ 1
the 1
King, 1
as 0
part 0
and 0
parcel 0
of 0
that 0
universal 0
power 0
“in 0
heaven 0
and 0
on 0
earth” 0
which 0
He 0
received 0
from 0
His 0
Father 0
(Matt. 0

28:18) 0
after 0
His 0
Resurrection. 0

From 1
that 1
point 1
on 1
it 1
is 1
Christ 1
who 1
delegates 1
the 1
divine 1
authority 1
to 1
punish 1
by 1
killing, 1
and 1
both 1
Scripture 1
and 1
tradition 1
testify 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
lawfully 1
wielded 1
by 1
those 1
to 1
whom 1
He 1
entrusts 1
the 1
temporal 1
sword 1
in 1
His 1
Kingdom. 1

As 0
He 0
told 0
Pontius 0
Pilate 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
His 0
trial, 0
“Thou 0
shouldst 0
not 0
have 0
any 0
power 0
against 0
me, 0
unless 0
it 0
were 0
given 0
thee 0
from 0
above” 0
(John 0
19:10). 0

Pope 0

Leo 0
XIII 0
re-affirmed 0
this 0
truth 0
in 0
Sapientiae 0
Christianae 0
in 0
1890, 0
when 0
he 0
declared 0
that 0
“true 0
and 0
legitimate 0
authority 0
is 0
devoid 0
of 0
sanction 0
unless 0
it 0
proceed 0
from 0
God 0
the 0
supreme 0
Ruler 0
and 0
Lord 0
of 0
all. 0

The 0
Almighty 0
alone 0
can 0
commit 0
power 0
to 0
a 0
man 0
over 0
his 0
fellow 0
men.” 0
Even 0
though 0
they 0
may 0
be 0
unaware 0
of 0
the 0
true 0
source 0
of 0
their 0
power, 0
it 0
is 0
always 0
the 0
duty 0
of 0
legitimate 0
authorities 0
to 0
ensure 0
public 0
order 0
by 0
punishing 0
evil-doers, 0
by 0
death 0
if 0
appropriate. 0

As 0
St. 0
Paul 0
said: 0

Therefore 0
he 0
that 0
resisteth 0
the 0
power, 0
resisteth 0
the 0
ordinance 0
of 0
God, 0
and 0
they 0
that 0
resist 0
purchase 0
to 0
themselves 0
eternal 0
damnation. 0

For 0
rulers 0
are 0
not 0
a 0
terror 0
to 0
the 0
good 0
work, 0
but 0
to 0
the 0
evil. 0

. 0

. 0

For 0
he 0
is 0
the 0
minister 0
of 0
God 0
to 0
thee 0
for 0
good. 0

But 0
if 0
thou 0
do 0
that 0
which 0
is 0
evil, 0
fear: 0
for 0
he 0
beareth 0
not 0
the 0
sword 0
in 0
vain. 0

For 0
he 0
is 0
the 1
minister 1
of 1
God: 1
and 1
avenger 1
to 1
execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
doth 1
evil 1
(Rom. 0

13:2-4). 0

Sufficient 0
of 0
itself 0
to 0
expiate 0
every 0
sin 0
which 0
the 0
children 0
of 0
Adam 0
could 0
ever 0
commit, 0
the 0
execution 0
of 0
the 0
Man-God 0
nevertheless 0
did 0
not 0
abolish 1
the 0
penalty 0
of 0
death. 0

It 0
continues 0
to 0
be 0
the 1
wages 1
of 1
sin 1
(Rom 0
6:23), 0
and 0
men 0
must 0
still 0
submit 0
to 0
it 0
sooner 0
or 0
later 0
by 0
forfeiting 0
their 0
lives, 0
either 0
willingly 0
or 0
unwillingly. 0

A 0
share 0
in 0
making 0
restitution 0
for 0
sin 0
was 0
thus 0
accorded 0
to 0
all 0
of 0
us, 0
for 0
although 0
our 0
Lord’s 0
ignominious 0
death 0
removed 0
from 0
us 0
the 0
guilt 0
of 0
the 0
original 0
transgression 0
through 0
Baptism, 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
remove 0
its 0
effects. 0

These 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
remain 0
as 0
restraints 0
on 0
men 0
who, 0
now 0
raised 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
supernatural 0
existence, 0
were 0
capable 1
of 1
committing 1
incalculably 1
more 1
grievous 1
sins 1
than 1
heretofore. 1

As 0
for 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
it 0
remains 0
the 1
inescapable 1
consequence 1
of 1
our 1
fallen 1
nature 1
and 0
is 0
of 0
the 0
highest 0
utility 0
in 0
deterring 0
us 0
from 0
following 0
our 1
hereditary 1
inclination 1
to 1
evil. 1

What 0

Christ 0
did 0
was 0
to 0
sanctify 0
the 0
death 0
penalty, 0
transforming 0
it 0
into 0
a 0
sacrament 0
of 0
life 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
believe. 0

As 0
St. 0
Paul 0
declared, 0
“Death 0
is 0
swallowed 0
up 0
in 0
victory. 0

O 0
death, 0
where 0
is 0
thy 0
victory? 0

O 0
death, 0
where 0
is 0
thy 0
sting?. 0

. 0

. 0

For 0
by 0
a 0
man 0
came 0
death, 0
and 0
by 0
a 0
man 0
the 0
resurrection 0
of 0
the 0
dead. 0

And 0
as 0
in 0
Adam 0
all 0
die, 0
so 0
also 0
in 0
Christ 0
all 0
shall 0
be 0
made 0
alive” 0
(1 0
Cor. 0

15: 0
54-55; 0
21-22). 0

The 0
first 0
of 0
that 0
numberless 0
host 0
of 0
Christian 0
martyrs 0
who 0
would 0
be 0
put 0
to 0
death 0
by 0
constituted 0
authority 0
for 0
testifying 0
to 0
the 0
truth, 0
Christ 0
commanded 0
His 0
disciples 0
to 0
“Follow 0
me!” 0
Inviting 0
all 0
to 0
Calvary 0
to 0
“suffer 0
under 0
Pontius 0
Pilate” 0
with 0
Him, 0
He 0
granted 0
a 0
meritorious 0
share 0
in 0
accomplishing 0
“the 0
mystery 0
which 0
hath 0
been 0
hidden 0
for 0
ages 0
and 0
generations, 0
but 0
is 0
now 0
made 0
manifest 0
to 0
his 0
saints” 0
to 0
all 0
who, 0
like 0
St. 0
Paul, 0
would 0
“now 0
rejoice 0
in 0
my 0
sufferings 0
for 0
you 0
and 0
fill 0
up 0
those 0
things 0
which 0
are 0
wanting 0
of 0
the 0
sufferings 0
of 0
Christ 0
in 0
my 0
flesh, 0
for 0
his 0
body 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
church. 0

. 0

.” 0
(Col. 0
1:26, 0
24). 0

Criminals 0

put 0
to 0
death 0
undergo 0
a 0
penalty 0
no 0
different 0
from 0
the 0
one 0
exacted 0
from 0
the 0
most 0
innocent 0
amongst 0
us. 0

As 1
with 1
everyone 1
else 1
the 1
moment 1
of 1
death 1
ushers 1
them 1
either 1
into 1
heaven, 1
hell 1
or 1
purgatory. 1

The 0
most 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
said 0
is 0
that 0
their 0
lives 0
here 0
on 0
earth 0
are 0
shortened, 0
and 0
they 0
must 0
settle 1
their 1
accounts 1
sooner 0
than 0
expected. 0

This 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
great 0
mercy 0
for 0
them 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
for 0
society, 0
both 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
expiation 0
and 0
protection 0
from 0
any 0
future 0
crimes 0
they 0
might 0
have 0
perpetrated. 0

The 0
death 0
penalty, 0
from 0
the 0
first 0
one 0
imposed 0
on 0
man 0
by 0
God 0
in 0
the 0
beginning 0
in 0
Eden, 0
to 0
the 0
one 0
imposed 0
on 0
God 0
by 0
man 0
on 0
that 0
Good 0
Friday 0
in 0
Jerusalem, 0
on 0
down 0
to 0
those 0
still 0
being 0
imposed 0
today, 0
transcends 1
human 1
legislation. 1

By 1
divine 1
decree 1
it 1
will 1
perdure 1
until 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
time, 1
when 1
“the 1
former 1
things 1
are 1
passed 1
away.” 1
Only 1
then 1
“death 1
shall 1
be 1
no 1
more, 1
nor 1
mourning, 1
nor 1
crying, 1
nor 1
sorrow 1
shall 1

April. 0

On 0
average, 0
between 0
300 0
and 0
600 0
infections 0
are 0
recorded 0
every 0
year 0
among 0
a 0
population 0
approaching 0
25 0
million 0
people, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
UN 0
estimate. 0

But 0

Tedros 0
voiced 0
alarm 0
that 0
"plague 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
behaved 0
in 0
a 1
very, 1
very 1
different 1
way 0
this 0
year." 0

Cases 0

sprang 0
up 0
far 0
earlier 0
than 0
usual 0
and, 0
instead 0
of 0
being 0
confined 0
to 0
the 0
countryside, 0
the 0
disease 0
infiltrated 0
towns. 0

The 0
authorities 0
recorded 0
more 0
than 0
2 0
000 0
cases, 0
and 0
Tedros 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
the 0
death 0
toll 0
stood 0
at 0
207. 0

He 1

also 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
the 1
pneumonic 1
version, 1
which 1
spreads 1
more 1
easily 1
and 1
is 1
more 1
virulent, 1
in 1
the 1
latest 1
outbreak. 1

He 0

praised 0
the 0
rapid 0
response 0
from 0
WHO 0
and 0
Madagascar 0
authorities 0
that 0
helped 0
bring 0
the 0
outbreak 0
under 0
control, 0
but 1
warned 1
that 1
the 1
danger 1
was 1
not 1
over. 1

The 0

larger-than-usual 0
outbreak 0
had 0
helped 0
spread 0
the 0
bacteria 0
that 0
causes 0
the 0
plague 0
more 0
widely. 0

This 0

along 0
with 0
poor 0
sanitation 0
and 0
vector 0
control 0
on 0
Madagascar 0
meant 0
that 0
"when 1
(the 1
plague) 1
comes 1
again 1
it 1
starts 1
from 1
more 1
stock, 1
and 1
the 1
magnitude 1
in 1
the 1
next 1
transmission 1
could 1
be 1
higher 1
than 1
the 1
one 1
that 1
we 1
saw," 1
Tedros 0
said. 0

"That 0

means 0
that 0
Madagascar 0
could 0
be 0
affected 0
more, 0
and 0
not 0
only 0
that, 0
it 1
could 1
even 1
spill 1
over 1
into 1
neighbouring 1
countries 1
and 1
beyond," 1
he 0
warned. 0

Complicating 0

vector 0
control 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
fleas 0
that 0
carry 0
the 0
Yersinia 0
pestis 0
bacteria 0
that 0
causes 0
the 0
plague 0
have 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
widely 0
resistant 0
to 0
chemicals 0
and 0
insecticides. 0

"That's 0

a 0
dangerous 0
combination," 0
Tedros 0
said. 0

Trial 0
Sequel 0

Last 0
week, 0
a 0
San 0
Francisco 0
jury 0
acquitted 0
seven-time 0
felon 0
Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate, 0
a 0
repeatedly 0
deported 0
Mexican 0
national, 0
of 0
all 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges 0
in 0
the 0
July 0
1, 0
2015, 0
fatal 0
shooting 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle 0
as 0
she 0
walked 0
with 0
her 0
father 0
and 0
a 0
friend 0
on 0
Pier 0
14. 0

The 0
jury 0
found 0
the 0
confessed 0
shooter 0
guilty 0
only 0
of 0
felony 0
gun 0
possession. 0

Many 0
observers 0
decried 0
the 0
verdict 0
as 0
a 0
travesty 0
of 0
justice, 0
but 0
they 0
were 0
mistaken 0
if 0
they 0
thought 0
it 0
could 0
not 0
get 0
any 0
worse. 0

San 0
Francisco 0
public 0
defender 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
now 0
seeks 0
to 0
have 0
Zarate’s 0
gun 0
possession 0
charge 0
dismissed. 0

Gonzalez 0
is 0
contending 0
the 0
jury 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
told 0
that 0
“momentary” 0
possession 0
of 0
a 0
gun 0
is 0
not 0
necessarily 0
a 0
crime. 0

“If 0
you 0
possess 0
it 0
just 0
to 0
dispose 0
of 0
it 0
or 0
abandon 0
it, 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
a 0
crime,” 0
Gonzalez 0
told 0
reporters. 0

The 0
Steinle 0
family 0
and 0
relatives 0
of 0
murder 0
victims 0
have 0
new 0
cause 0
for 0
outrage, 0
but 0
this 0
gambit 0
is 0
consistent 0
with 0
Gonzalez 0
and 0
the 1
San 1
Francisco 1
show-trial 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
co-starred. 1

Gonzalez 0
hails 0
from 0
McAllen, 0
Texas, 0
and 0
attended 0
Columbia 0
University 0
on 0
a 0
scholarship. 0

As 0
he 0
explained, 0
“I 0
think 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
product 0
of 0
affirmative 0
action,” 0
and 0
ethnic 0
preferences 0
doubtless 0
played 0
a 0
role 0
in 0
admission 0
to 0
Stanford 0
Law 0
School. 0

In 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
Gonzalez 0
became 0
known 0
as 0
“The 1
Great 1
Left 1
Hope,” 1
and 0
a 0
hero 0
to 0
Bay 0
Area 0
radicals. 0

The 0
La 0
Raza 0
Lawyers 0
Association 0
named 0
Gonzalez 0
Lawyer 0
of 0
the 0
Year, 0
and 0
the 0
Mexican 0
American 0
Political 0
Association, 0
a 0
group 0
with 0
roots 0
in 0
the 0
Communist 0
Party, 0
gave 0
him 0
the 0
Bert 0
Corona 0
award, 0
after 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
CPUSA’s 0
most 0
high-profile 0
Stalinists. 0

In 0
2,000, 0
after 0
a 0
decade 0
as 0
a 0
public 0
defender, 0
Gonzalez 0
gained 0
election 0
to 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
Board 0
of 0
Supervisors. 0

In 0
2003, 0
as 0
board 0
president, 0
he 0
commissioned 0
a 0
graffiti 0
artist 0
to 0
spray 0
SMASH 1
THE 1
STATE 1
on 0
his 0
office 0
wall, 0
in 0
“traffic 0
cone 0
orange.” 0
As 0
Gonzalez 0
explained, 0
“This 0
is 0
a 0
sentiment 0
I 0
think 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
have 0
had. 0

You 0
have 0
to 0
rally 0
and 0
find 0
ways 0
of 0
opposing 0
what 0
you 0
don’t 0
like.” 0

In 0
2003 0
Gonzalez 0
ran 0
for 0
mayor 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco 0
but 0
lost 0
to 0
Gavin 0
Newsom. 0

In 0
2008 0
Green 0
Party 0
presidential 0
candidate 0
Ralph 0
Nader 0
tapped 0
Gonzalez 0
for 0
vice 0
president. 0

“He 1
has 1
a 1
great, 1
steadfast 1
commitment 1
to 1
justice,” 1
Nader 0
told 0
reporters. 0

On 0
that 0
score, 0
the 0
Steinle 0
family 0
and 0
other 0
relatives 0
of 0
murder 0
victims 0
have 0
room 0
for 0
reasonable 0
doubt. 0

In 0
jury 0
selection, 0
Gonzalez 0
and 0
the 0
prosecutor, 0
assistant 0
district 0
attorney 0
Diana 0
Garcia, 0
included 0
three 0
“immigrants,” 0
quite 0
possibly 0
false-documented 0
illegals. 0

True 0
to 0
form, 0
judge 0
Samuel 0
Feng 0
sealed 0
the 0
identities 0
of 0
the 0
jurors. 0

So 0
observers 0
have 0
grounds 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
Garcia 0
and 0
Gonzalez 0
both 0
got 0
the 0
jury 0
they 0
wanted. 0

Garcia 0
told 0
the 0
court 0
Zarate 0
was 0
playing 0
his 0
own 0
“secret 1
version 1
of 1
Russian 1
roulette,” 1
and 0
thus 0
parroted 0
the 0
defense’s 0
contention 0
that 0
the 0
shooting 0
was 0
all 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
chance. 0

As 0
it 0
happens, 0
in 0
Russian 0
roulette 0
a 0
shooter 0
loads 0
one 0
bullet 0
into 0
a 0
six-shot 0
revolver, 0
spins 0
the 0
cylinder, 0
then 0
puts 0
the 0
gun 0
to 0
his 0
own 0
head 0
and 0
pulls 0
the 0
trigger. 0

In 0
a 0
central 0
fact 0
of 0
the 0
case, 0
Zarate 0
did 0
not 0
aim 0
the 0
gun 0
at 0
himself 0
but 0
fired 0
in 0
the 0
direction 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle. 0

In 0
another 0
established 0
fact, 0
the 0
bullet 0
struck 0
her 0
in 0
the 0
lower 0
back 0
and 0
tore 0
through 0
her 0
abdominal 0
aorta. 0

This 0
happened 0
in 0
broad 0
daylight, 0
but 0
as 0
in 0
In 0
the 0
Heat 0
of 0
the 0
Night, 0
they 0
had 0
the 0
body 0
which 0
was 0
dead. 0

Garcia 0
Zarate 0
confessed 0
to 0
firing 0
the 0
shot 0
and 0
had 0
gunpowder 0
residue 0
on 0
his 0
hands. 0

After 0
firing, 0
he 0
tossed 0
the 0
gun 0
in 0
the 0
water. 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
found 0
the 0
stolen 0
weapon 0
wrapped 0
in 0
a 0
cloth 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
discharged 0
by 0
itself, 0
both 0
utterly 0
unbelievable 0
claims. 0

Even 0
so, 0
the 0
politically 0
correct 0
jury 0
found 0
the 0
career 0
criminal 0
not 0
guilty 0
of 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter. 0

Any 0
observer 0
could 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
believing 0
that 0
prosecution 0
and 0
defense 0
both 0
got 0
the 0
outcome 0
they 0
wanted. 0

Unlike 1
Stalin’s 1
trials 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
Bolsheviks, 1
and 1
Fidel 1
Castro’ 1
trial 1
of 1
General 1
Arnaldo 1
Ochoa, 1
this 1
show 1
trial 1
aimed 1
to 1
establish 1
innocence 1
for 1
the 1
guilty, 1
and 1
the 1
dynamics 1
of 1
the 1
left 1
were 1
on 1
full 1
display. 1

Denunciations 0
of 0
“gun 0
violence” 0
were 0
nowhere 0
in 0
evidence 0
and 0
expressions 0
of 0
sympathy 0
for 0
the 0
Steinle 0
family 0
proved 0
pathetically 0
weak. 0

As 0
Arthur 0
Koestler 0
said, 0
on 0
the 0
left 0
the 0
truth 0
is 0
spoken 0
with 0
loathing 0
and 0
falsehood 0
with 0
love. 0

On 0
the 0
left, 0
as 0
Orwell 0
had 0
it 0
in 0
Animal 0
Farm, 0
rats 0
are 0
comrades, 0
and 0
criminals 0
are 0
victims 0
of 0
capitalist 0
society. 0

In 0
the 0
view 0
of 0
Gonzalez, 0
society 1
is 1
progressing 1
toward 1
a 1
social 1
justice 1
paradise 1
ruled 1
by 1
a 1
wise 1
elite 1
that 1
knows 1
what’s 1
best 1
for 1
all. 1

In 0
this 0
inexorable 0
progress, 0
determined 0
by 0
history, 0
some 0
people 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
die. 0

As 1
Bertolt 1
Brecht 1
told 1
Sidney 1
Hook 1
about 1
Stalin’s 1
victims, 1
“the 1
more 1
innocent 1
they 1
are, 1
the 1
more 1
they 1
deserve 1
to 1
be 1
shot.” 1

Out 0
for 0
a 0
summer-day 0
walk 0
with 0
her 0
father 0
and 0
a 0
friend, 0
Kate 0
Steinle 0
was 0
a 0
completely 0
innocent 0
victim, 0
gunned 0
down 0
by 0
a 0
career 0
criminal 0
who 0
was 0
not 0
even 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
but 0
found 0
special 0
protection 0
in 0
the 0
sanctuary 0
city 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
sanctuary 0
state 0
of 0
California. 0

As 0
defense 0
attorney 0
Francisco 0
Ugarte 0
said, 0
the 0
verdict 0
was 0
a 0
“vindication 0
for 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
immigrants.” 0

Since 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
mentioned 0
the 0
case, 0
former 0
vice-presidential 0
candidate 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
had 0
to 0
establish 0
the 0
complete 0
innocence 0
of 0
the 0
shooter. 0

That 1
explains 1
the 1
effort 1
of 1
“The 1
Great 1
Left 1
Hope” 1
to 1
have 1
his 1
client’s 1
felony 1
gun 1
possession 1
conviction 1
tossed. 1

Any 0
observer 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
could 0
believe 0
it 0
probably 0
will 0
be. 0

Desperate 0
Feinstein 0
Pushes 0
30-Year-Old 0
Claim 0
About 0
Sexual 0
Misconduct 0
Of 0
Kavanaugh 0

It's 1
incredible 1
the 0
amount 0
of 0
hypocrisy 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
puts 0
on 0
display 0
for 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
to 1
see, 1
and 0
yet, 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
her 0
state 0
continue 0
to 0
put 0
her 0
in 0
office. 0

Her 0
latest 0
antics 0
are 0
to 1
point 1
to 1
a 1
more 1
than 1
30 1
year 1
old 1
claim 1
that 1
Supreme 1
Court 1
nominee 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh 1
engaged 1
in 1
sexual 1
misconduct 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
high 1
school 1
and 1
somehow 1
claim 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
committed 1
a 1
crime 1
while 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
remaining 1
silent 1
on 1
two 1
women 1
who 1
have 1
accused 1
Rep. 1
Keith 1
Ellison, 1
who 1
is 1
running 1
for 1
Attorney 1
General 1
in 1
Minnesota, 1
of 1
abusing 1
them, 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
making 1
the 1
claim 1
this 1
year. 1

“I 0
have 0
received 0
information 0
from 0
an 0
individual 0
concerning 0
the 0
nomination 0
of 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court,” 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
surprise 0
statement. 0

“That 0
individual 0
strongly 0
requested 0
confidentiality, 0
declined 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
or 0
press 0
the 0
matter 0
further, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
honored 0
that 0
decision. 0

I 0
have, 0
however, 0
referred 0
the 0
matter 0
to 0
federal 0
investigative 0
authorities.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
that 0
bringing 0
something 0
like 0
this 0
up 0
more 0
than 0
30 0
years 0
later 0
is 0
ridiculous, 1

A 0
spokesperson 0
for 0
Feinstein 0
declined 0
Fox 0
News’ 0
request 0
to 0
elaborate 0
on 0
the 0
lawmaker’s 0
statement, 0
but 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
much 0
speculation 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
referring 0
to 0
a 0
secret 0
letter 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
intrigue 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
days. 0

A 0
source 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
confirmation 0
proceedings 0
told 0
Fox 0
News 0
that 0
Feinstein 0
received 0
the 0
letter 0
back 0
in 0
July, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
its 0
existence 0
known 0
publicly 0
until 0
Thursday. 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
report 0
by 0
The 0
Intercept, 0
the 0
letter 0
was 0
relayed 0
to 0
lawmakers 0
by 0
an 0
individual 0
affiliated 0
with 0
Stanford 0
University 0
and 0
concerns 0
an 0
incident 0
involving 0
the 0
53-year-old 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
a 0
woman 0
while 0
they 0
were 0
in 0
high 0

According 0
to 0
two 0
officials 0
who 0
spoke 0
anonymously 0
with 0
the 0
New 0

the 0

reportedly 0
was 0
given 0
to 0
Feinstein 0
by 0
Rep. 0
Anna 0
Eshoo, 0
D-Calif., 0
but 0
has 0
not 0

by 0

who 0
have 0
seen 0
the 0
document. 0

Sen. 0
Dick 0
Durbin, 0

said 0
that 0
the 0
letter 0
in 0

has 0
been 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
for 0
investigation. 0

The 0
FBI 0
conducts 0
background 0
checks 0

“Upon 0
receipt 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
September 0
12, 0
we 0
included 0
it 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
background 0
file, 0
as 0
per 0
the 0
standard 0
process,” 0
the 0
FBI 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
called 0
this 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
last 1
minute 1
gambit, 1
and 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
correct. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
no 0
plans 0
to 0
pursue 0
any 0
investigation 0
regarding 0
the 0
allegation. 0

According 0
to 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post: 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
person 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
matter, 0
the 0
FBI 0
does 0
not 0
now 0
plan 0
to 0
launch 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
matter, 0
which 0
would 0
normally 0
be 0
handled 0
by 0
local 0
authorities, 0
if 0
it 0
was 0
within 0
the 0
statute 0
of 0
limitations. 0

The 0
FBI 0
instead 0
passed 0
the 0
material 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House, 0
as 0
an 0
update 0
to 0
Kavanaugh's 0
background 0
check, 0
which 0
already 0
had 0
been 0
completed, 0
the 0
person 0
said. 0

The 0
move 0
is 0
similar 0
to 0
what 0
the 0
bureau 0
did 0
when 0
allegations 0
were 0
leveled 0
against 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
Rob 0
Porter. 0

... 0
Senate 0
Majority 0

John 0
Cornyn 0
(R-Texas) 0
dismissed 0
the 0
controversy 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“Let 0

Right,” 0
he 0

sarcastically. 0

“I 0
will 0
add: 0
the 0

Cornyn 0
wrote. 0

Exactly! 0

This 0
is 0
political 1
theater 1
over 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
originalist 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
strict 0
Constitutionalist. 0

He's 1
a 1
precedence 1
man! 1

He's 0
said 0
it 0
over 0
and 0
over! 0

If 0
they 0
wanted 0
something 0
on 0
the 0
guy, 0
why 1
don't 1
they 1
bring 1
up 1
his 1
involvement 1
in 1
the 1
Vince 1
Foster 1
cover-up? 1

Now, 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
something 0
to 0
really 0
look 0
into, 0
but 0
not 0
with 0
the 1
corrupt 1
DOJ 1
and 1
FBI 1
we 0
currently 0
have. 0

Of 0
course, 0
if 1
they 1
did, 1
then 1
someone 1
might 1
actually 1
have 1
to 1
act 1
on 1
something 1
that 1
actually 1
was 1
a 1

From 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
this 0
case, 0
it 0
was 0
clear 0
that 0
Guyger 0
was 0
receiving 0
special 0
treatment 0
from 0
law 0
enforcement. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
glaring 1
instances 0
showing 0
her 0
privilege 0
was 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Texas 0
Rangers 0
said 0
in 0
their 0
report 0
that 0
Jean 0
refused 0
to 0
obey 0
Guyger’s 0
“verbal 0
commands.” 0
Had 0
anyone 0
else 0
but 0
a 0
cop 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
and 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man, 0
do 0
you 0
believe 0
that 0
investigators 0
would 0
have 0
said 0
anything 0
like 0
this? 0

Attorney 0
Stephen 0
Le 0
Brocq, 0
who 0
operates 0
a 0
law 0
firm 0
in 0
the 0
North 0
Texas 0
area 0
sums 0
up 0
the 0
treatment 0
of 0
Guyger 0
perfectly 0
when 0
he 0
says 0
that 0
“The 0
affidavit 0
isn’t 0
written 0
objectively, 0
not 0
at 0
the 0
slightest. 0

As 0
stated 0
before, 0
they 0
are 0
usually 0
wholly 0
against 0
the 0
accused. 0

An 0
objective 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
related 0
by 0
the 0
officer 0
would 0
be 0
proper, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion. 0

This 0
affidavit 0
states 0
facts 0
based 0
upon 0
the 0
word 0
of 0
the 0
person 0
it 0
seeks 0
to 0
accuse 0
of 0
criminal 0
wrongdoing.” 0

What’s 0
more, 0
according 0
to 0
WFAA, 0
who 0
obtained 0
affidavits 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
search 0
warrants 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
case, 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
involved 0
the 0
search 0
of 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
don’t 0
recall, 0
police 0
egregiously 1
released 0
the 0
search 0
warrant 0
findings 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
his 0
family 0
buried 0
his 0
dead 0
body. 0

They 0
attempted 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Jean’s 0
character 0
by 0
claiming 0
they 0
found 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
half 0
ounce 0
of 0
weed 0
in 0
his 0
apartment. 0

However, 0
they 0
failed 0
miserably 1
at 0
it. 0

One 0
thing 0
in 0
particular, 0
however, 0
stood 0
out 0
to 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
the 0
police 0
didn’t 0
release 0
any 0
information 0
on 0
what 0
they 0
found 0
in 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
information 0
currently 0
available, 0
that’s 0
because 0
they 0
didn’t 0
search 0
it. 0

According 0
to 0
WFAA, 0
there 0
were 0
five 0
search 0
warrants 0
issued 0
in 0
the 0
case—none 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
for 0
the 0
killer’s 0
apartment. 0

As 0

reports: 0

Now, 0
even 0
if 0
police 0
would 0
try 0
to 0
search 0
the 0
killer 1
cop’s 1
apartment, 0
it’s 0
too 0
late. 0

On 0
Sunday, 0
apartment 0
staff 0
notified 0
residents 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
that 0
Guyger 0
“has 0
vacated 0
her 0
apartment 0
and 0
no 0
longer 0
resides 0
at 0
our 1
community.” 1

A 0
manager 0
at 0
the 0
complex 0
declined 0
to 0
indicate 0
exactly 0
when 0
Guyger 0
moved 0
out 0
and 0
if 0
she 0
left 0
the 0
premises 0
voluntarily, 0

reports. 0

While 0
residents 0
can 0
certainly 0
sleep 0
better 0
knowing 0
that 0
they 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
fear 1
a 0
killer 1
cop 1
walking 0
into 0
their 0
apartment 0
and 0
murdering 0
them, 0
the 0
family 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean 0

this 0

that 0
the 1

Do 0
you 0
know 0
how 0

You 0

that 0
nurtures 0

Therefore, 0
the 0

not 0

the 0

during 0

I 0

from 0

Republican 0
Senators 0

were 0
trying 0
to 0
introduce 0
a 0
supply-side 0
economic 0
policy 0
as 0
a 0
cure 0
for 0
the 0
stagflation 0
that 0
was 0
threatening 0
the 0
US 0
economy 0
with 0
failure. 0

The 0
Democrats, 0
who 0
later 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
led 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
a 0
supply-side 0
policy, 0
were, 0
at 0
this 0
time, 0
opposed 0
(see 0
Paul 0
Craig 0
Roberts, 0
The 0
Supply-Side 0
Revolution, 0
Harvard 0
University 0
Press, 0
1984). 0

The 0
Democrats 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
policy 0
would 0
worsen 0
the 0
budget 0
deficit, 0
the 0
only 0
time 0
in 0
those 0
days 0
Democrats 0
cared 0
about 0
the 0
budget 0
deficit. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
said 0
that 0
they 0
would 0

if 0
the 0

would 0
support 0
offsetting 0
cuts 0
in 0
the 0
budget 0
to 0
support 0
a 0

budget. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0

to 0
put 0
Republicans 0
on 0
the 0
spot 0
for 0
taking 0
away 0
some 0
groups’ 0
handouts 0
in 0
order 0
“to 0
cut 0
tax 0

for 0
the 0

The 0
supply-side 0
policy 0
did 0
not 0
require 0
budget 0
cuts, 0
but 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
the 0
Democrats 0
lack 0
of 0
sincerety, 0
Hayakawa’s 0
aid 0
and 0
I 0
had 0
our 0
senators 0
introduce 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
budget 0
cuts 0
together 0
with 0
tax 0
cuts 0
that, 0
on 0
a 0

basis 0
(not 0
counting 0
tax 0
revenue 0
feedbacks 0
from 0
the 0

of 0

kept 0
the 0
budget 0

and 0
the 0

voted 0
against 0
them 0
every 0
time. 0

When 0
the 0
combination 0
of 0
tax 0
cuts 0
with 0
defense 0
budget 0

came 0
up 0
for 0
a 0

the 1
legendary 1

Strom 0
Thurmond, 0
a 0
48-year 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Senate 0
from 0
South 0

tapped 0
me 0
on 0
the 0
shoulder. 0

He 0
said: 0
“son, 1
never 1
set 1
your 1
senator 1
up 1
against 1

complex. 1

He 1
will 1
not 1
be 1

and 1
you 1
will 1

out 1

I 0
replied 0
that 0

were 0
just 0
establishing 0
for 0
the 0

that 0
under 0
no 0

would 0
the 0

even 0
if 0
there 0
was 0

He 0
replied: 0
“son, 0
the 1

doesn’t 1
care.” 1

My 0
emergence 1
from 1
The 1
Matrix 1
began 0
with 0
Thurmond’s 0
pat 0
on 0
my 0
shoulder. 0

It 0
grew 0
with 0
my 0
time 0
at 0
the 0
Wall 0
Street 0
Journal 0
when 0
I 0
learned 0
that 0
some 0
truthful 0
things 0
simply 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
said. 0

In 0
the 0
Treasury 0
I 0
experienced 0
how 0
those 0
outside 0
interests 0
opposed 0
to 0
a 0
president’s 0
policy 0
marshall 1
their 1
forces 1
and 0
the 0
media 0
that 0
they 0
own 0
to 0
block 0
it. 0

Later 0
as 0
a 0

committee, 0
I 0
saw 0
how 0
the 0

attempted 0
to 0
prevent 0
President 0
Reagan 0
from 0
ending 0
the 0
Cold 0
War. 0

Today, 1
right 1
now, 1
at 1
this 1
moment, 1
we 1
are 1
faced 1
with 1
a 1
massive 1
effort 1
of 1
the 1

complex, 1
the 1
neoconservatives, 1
the 1
Democratic 1
Party, 1
and 1
the 1
presstitute 1

to 1
discredit 1
the 1
elected 1
President 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
and 1
to 1
overthrow 1
him 1
in 1
order 1
that 1
the 1
utterly 1

that 1
rule 1
American 1
can 1
continue 1
to 1
hold 1
on 1
to 1
power 1
and 1
to 1
protect 1
the 1
massive 1
budget 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex 1
that, 1
along 1
with 1
the 1
Israel 1
Lobby, 1
funds 1
the 1
elections 1
of 1
those 1
who 1
rule 1
us. 1

Trump, 0
like 0
Reagan, 0
was 0
an 0
exception, 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
exceptions 0
that 0
accumulate 0
the 0
ire 0
of 0
the 0
corrupt 0
leftwing, 0
bought 0
off 0
with 0
money, 0
and 0
the 1
ire 1
of 1
the 1

concentrated 0
into 0
small 0
tight 0
ownership 0

indebted 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
permitted 0
the 0
illegal 0
concentration 0
of 0
a 0
once 0
independent 0
and 0
diverse 0
American 0
media 0
that 0
once 0
served, 0
on 0
occasion, 0
as 0
a 1
watchdog 1
over 1
government. 1

The 1
rightwing, 1
wrapped 1
in 1
the 1
flag, 1
dismisses 1
all 1
truth 1
as 1
“anti-American.” 1

the 1

Fifth 1

Atlanticist 0

this 0

purpose 1
of 1
preventing 1
President 1

from 1

cannot 0

Here 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
clued-in 0
Russian 0
Defense 0
Minister 0
Shoigu 0
has 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 1
aggressive 1
actions 1
of 1
the 1
West 1
against 1
the 1
Russian 1
homeland. 1

If 0

Keep 1
in 1
mind 1
that 1
no 1
media 1
informs 1
you 1
better 1
than 1
my 1
website. 1

If 0
my 0
website 0
goes 0
down, 0
you 0
will 0
be 0
left 0
in 0
darkness. 0

No 1
valid 1
information 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
US 1
government 1
or 1
the 1
Western 1
presstitutes. 1

If 1
you 1
sit 1
in 1
front 1
of 1
the 1
TV 1
screen 1
watching 1
the 1
Western 1
media, 1
you 1
are 1
brainwashed 1
beyond 1
all 1
hope. 1

Not 1
even 1
I 1
can 1
rescue 1
you. 1

Nor 1
God 1
himself. 1

Americans, 0
and 0
indeed 0
the 0
Russians 0
themselves, 0
are 0
incapable 0
of 0
realizing 0
it, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
chance 0
that 0
Trump 0
will 0
be 0
overthrown 0
and 0
a 0
Western 0
assault 0
will 0
be 0
launched 0
against 0
the 0
handful 0
of 0
countries 0
that 0
insist 0
on 0
sovereignty. 0

I 1
doubt 1
that 1
few 1
of 1
the 1
Americans 1
who 1
elected 1
Trump 1
will 1
be 1
taken 1
in 1
by 1
the 1
anti-Trump 1
propagana, 1
but 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
organized 0
and 0
have 0
no 0
armed 0
power. 0

The 0
police, 0
militarized 0
by 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
Obama, 0
will 0
be 0
set 0
against 0
them. 0

The 0
rebellions 0
will 0
be 0
local 0
and 0
suppressed 0
by 0
every 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
Constitution 0
by 0
the 0
private 0
powers 0
that 0
rule 0
Washington, 0
as 0
always 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
case 0
with 0
rebellions 0
in 0
America. 0

In 1
the 1
West, 1
which 1
the 1
Russians 1
are 1
so 1
anxious 1
to 1
join, 1
all 1
freedoms 1
are 1
dead—freedom 0
of 0
assembly, 0
freedom 0
of 0
speech, 0
freedom 0
of 0
association, 0
freedom 0
of 0
inquiry, 0
freedom 0
of 0

freedom 0
from 0
arbitrary 0

freedom 1
from 0

arrest, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
Constitutional 0
protections 0
of 0
due 0
process 0
and 0
habeas 0

Today 1
there 1
are 1
no 1
countries 1
less 1
free 1
than 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
of 1
America. 1

Why 0
do 0
the 0
Russian 0
Atlanticist 0
Integrationists 0
want 0
to 0
join 0
an 0
unfree 0
Western 0
world? 0

Are 0
they 0
that 0
brainwashed 1
by 0
Western 0
Propaganda? 0

If 0
Putin 0
listens 0
to 0
these 0
deluded 1
fools, 1
Putin 0
will 0
destroy 0
Russia. 0

There 0
is 0
something 0
wrong 0
with 0
Russian 0
perception 0
of 0
Washington. 0

Apparently 0
the 0
Russian 0
elite, 0
with 0
the 0
exception 0
of 0
Shoigu 0
and 0
a 0
few 0
others 0
are 0
incapable 0
of 0
comprehending 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
drive 0
for 0
US 0
world 0
hegemony 0
and 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
determination 0
to 0
destroy 0
Russia 0
as 0
a 0
constraint 0
on 0
US 0
unilateralism. 0

The 0
Russian 0
government 0
somehow, 0
despite 0
all 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary, 0
believes 0
that 0
Washington’s 0

ignored 0
by 0
him—along 0
with 0
every 0
other 0
private 0
entreaty 0
concerning 0
his 0
destructive 0
activity—is 0
a 1
withering 1
indictment 1
of 1
a 1
papacy 1
that 1
constitutes 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
a 1
menace 1
to 1
the 1
Church. 1

The 0
key 0
passages 0
(paragraph 0

rebuke 0
Francis 0
for 0
his 0
recklessness, 0
his 0
deliberate 0
ambiguity, 0
his 0
fomenting 0
of 0
error, 0
his 0
sowing 0
of 0
disunity, 0
his 0
unheard-of 0
calumnies 0
of 0
the 0
faithful, 0
and 0
even 0
his 0
reduction 0
of 0
the 0
faith 0
to 0
an 0
ideology—precisely 0
the 0
wrong 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
accuses 0
orthodox 0
Catholics: 0

Your 0

Holiness, 0

a 1
chronic 1
confusion 1
seems 1
to 1
mark 1
your 1
pontificate…. 1

This 0
fosters 0
within 0
the 0
faithful 0
a 0
growing 0
unease 0
…. 0

In 0
"Amoris 0
Laetitia," 0
your 0
guidance 0
at 0
times 0
seems 0
intentionally 0
ambiguous, 0
thus 0
inviting 0
both 0
a 0
traditional 0
interpretation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
on 0
marriage 0
and 0
divorce 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
one 0
that 0
might 0
imply 0
a 0
change 0
in 0
that 0
teaching…. 0

To 1
teach 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
seemingly 1
intentional 1
lack 1
of 1
clarity 1
inevitably 1
risks 1
sinning 1
against 1
the 1
Holy 1
Spirit, 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
truth. 1

The 0
Holy 0
Spirit 0
is 0
given 0
to 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
particularly 0
to 0
yourself, 0
to 0
dispel 0
error, 0
not 0
to 0
foster 0
it. 0

[Y]ou 0
seem 0
to 0
censor 0
and 0
even 0
mock 0
those 0
who 0
interpret 0
Chapter 0
8 0
of 0
"Amoris 0
Laetitia" 0
in 0
accord 0
with 0
Church 0
tradition 0
as 0
Pharisaic 1
stone-throwers 1
who 1
embody 1
a 1
merciless 1
rigorism. 1

This 0
kind 0
of 0
calumny 0
is 0
alien 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
Petrine 0
ministry…. 0

Such 0
behavior 0
gives 0
the 0
impression 0
that 0
your 0
views 0
cannotsurvive 0
theological 0
scrutiny, 0
and 0
so 0
must 0
be 0
sustained 0
by 0
“ad 0
hominem” 0
arguments. 0

[T]oo 0
often 0
your 0
manner 0
seems 0
to 0
demean 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
Church 0
doctrine. 0

Again 0
and 0
again 0
you 0
portray 0
doctrine 0
as 0
dead 0
and 0
bookish, 0
and 0
far 0
from 0
the 0
pastoral 0
concerns 0
of 0
everyday 0
life. 0

Your 0
critics 0
have 0
been 0
accused, 0
in 0
your 0
own 0
words, 0
of 0
making 0
doctrine 0
an 0
ideology. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
precisely 0
Christian 0
doctrine… 0
that 0
frees 0
people 0
from 0
worldly 0
ideologies 0
and 0
assures 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
actually 0
preaching 0
and 0
teaching 0
the 0
authentic, 0
life-giving 0
Gospel. 0

Those 0
who 0
devalue 0
the 0
doctrines 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
[i.e., 0
Francis!] 0

separate 0
themselves 0
from 0
Jesus, 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
truth… 0
What 0
they 0
[i.e., 0
Francis] 0
then 0
possess, 0
and 0
can 0
only 0
possess, 0
is 0
an 0
ideology 0
– 0
one 0
that 0
conforms 0
to 0
the 0
world 0
of 0
sin 0
and 0
death. 0

[F]aithful 0
Catholics 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
disconcerted 0
by 0
your 0
choice 0
of 0
some 0
bishops, 0
men 0
who 0
seem 0
not 0
merely 0
open 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
views 0
counter 0
to 0
Christian 0
belief 0
but 0
who 0
support 0
and 0
even 0
defend 0
them. 0

What 0
scandalizes 0
believers, 0
and 0
even 0
some 0
fellow 0
bishops, 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
your 0
having 0
appointed 0
such 0
men 0
to 0
be 0
shepherds 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
but 0
that 0
you 0
also 0
seem 0
silent 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
their 0
teaching 0
and 0
pastoral 0
practice…. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
faithful, 0
who 0
embody 0
the 0
"sensus 0
fidelium," 0
are 0
losing 0
confidence 0
in 0
their 0
supreme 0
shepherd. 0

[T]he 0
Church 0
is 0
one 0
body, 0
the 0
Mystical 0
Body 0
of 0
Christ, 0
and 0
you 0
are 0
commissioned 0
by 0
the 0
Lord 0
himself 0
to 0
promote 0
and 0
strengthen 0
her 0
unity. 0

But 0
your 0
actions 0
and 0
words 0
too 0
often 0
seem 0
intent 0
on 0
doing 0
the 0
opposite…. 0

You 0
have 0
often 0
spoken 0
about 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
transparency 0
within 0
the 0
Church. 0

You 0
have 0
frequently 0
encouraged… 0
all 0
persons, 0
especially 0
bishops, 0
to 0
speak 0
their 0
mind 0
and 0
not 0
be 0
fearful 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
pope 0
may 0
think. 0

But… 0
what 0
many 0
[bishops] 0
have 0
learned 0
from 0
your 0
pontificate 0
is 0
not 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
open 0
to 0
criticism, 0
but 0
that 0
you 0
resent 0
it… 0
Many 0
fear 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
speak 0
their 0
mind, 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
marginalized 0
or 0
worse. 0

I 0
have 0
often 0
asked 0
myself: 0
"Why 0
has 0
Jesus 0
let 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
happen?" 0

The 1
only 1
answer 1
that 1
comes 1
to 1
mind 1
is 1
that 1
Jesus 1
wants 1
to 1
manifest 1
just 1
how 1
weak 1
is 1
the 1
faith 1
of 1
many 1
within 1
the 1
Church, 1
even 1
among 1
too 1
many 1
of 1
her 1
bishops. 1

Ironically, 1
your 1
pontificate 1
has 1
given 1
those 1
who 1
hold 1
harmful 1
theological 1
and 1
pastoral 1
views 1
the 1
license 1
and 1
confidence 1
to 1
come 1
into 1
the 1
light 1
and 1
expose 1
their 1
previously 1
hidden 1
darkness…. 1

Father 0
Weinandy 0
reveals 0
that 0
he 0
decided 0
to 0
publicize 0
this 0
historic 0
missive 0
only 0
after 0
receiving 0
an 0
unmistakable 0
sign 0
from 0
heaven. 0

As 0
he 0
recounts 0
here, 0
after 0
repeatedly 0
“beseeching 0
Jesus 0
and 0
Mary, 0
St. 0
Peter 0
and 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
saintly 0
popes 0
who 0
are 0
buried 0
there 0
to 0
do 0
something 0
to 0
rectify 0
the 0
confusion 0
and 0
turmoil 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
today, 0
a 0
chaos 0
and 0
an 0
uncertainty 0
that 0
I 0
felt 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
had 0
himself 0
caused,” 0
he 0
asked 0
for 0
a 0
minutely 0
specific 0
sign 0
from 0
heaven 0
on 0
whether 0
he 0
should 0
write 0
the 0
letter: 0
that 0
the 0
next 0
day 0
he 0
would 0
meet 0
someone 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
seen 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time, 0
would 0
never 0
expect 0
to 0
see 0
in 0
Rome, 0
and 0
was 0
not 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Canada 0
or 0
Great 0
Britain, 0
which 0
person 0
would 0
utter 0
the 0
particular 0
phrase: 0
“Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing.” 0

At 0

lunch 0
the 0
next 0
day, 0
the 0
sign 0
was 0
given. 0

An 0
old 0
friend 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
seen 0
in 0
more 0
than 0
twenty 0
years 0
and 0
would 0
never 0
have 0
expected 0
to 0
meet 0
in 0
Rome, 0
who 0
is 0
now 0
an 0
archbishop, 0
appeared 0
suddenly 0
from 0
between 0
two 0
parked 0
cars, 0
renewed 0
acquaintances 0
and, 0
referring 0
to 0
one 0
of 0
Father 0
Weinandy’s 0
books, 0
said: 0
“Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing.” 0

Writes 0

Fr. 0

Weinandy: 0
“I 0
could 0
hardly 0
believe 0
that 0
this 0
just 0
happened 0
in 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
a 0
few 0
minutes. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
longer 0
any 0
doubt 0
in 0
my 0
mind 0
that 0
Jesus 0
wanted 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
something. 0

I 0
also 0
think 0
it 0
significant 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
Archbishop 0
that 0
Jesus 0
used. 0

I 0
considered 0
it 0
an 0
apostolic 0
mandate.” 0

Can 0

we 0
doubt 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
indeed 0
an 0
apostolic 0
mandate? 0

Can 0
we 0
not 0
see 0
in 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
a 0
voice 0
raised 0
up 0
by 0
heaven 0
itself 0
to 0
say, 0
from 1
deep 1
within 1
the 1
post-conciliar 1
ecclesial 1
establishment, 1
things 1
that 1
exceed 1
in 1
their 1
candor 1
what 0
even 0
certain 0
traditionalist 0
commentators 0
have 0
ventured 0
to 0
state? 0

confirm 0
the 0
validity 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
indictment 0
of 0
this 0
pontificate, 0
only 0
a 0
day 0
after 0
this 0
letter 0
was 0
published, 0
the 0
USCCB 0
demanded 0
that 0

as 0
a 0
consultant 0
to 0

of 0

that 0
“In 0
making 0
such 0

request, 0
the 0

it 0
would 0
appear, 0
reinforces 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
very 0
point 0
about 0
fearfulness 0
and 0
lack 0
of 0
transparency.” 0

Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0

intervention 0
gives 0
us 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
remake 0
the 0
Church 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
mind 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
will 0
ultimately 0
encounter 0
a 0
resistance 0
that 0
will 0
bring 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
Latin 0
American-style 0
dictatorship 0
Francis 0
has 0
imposed 0
upon 0
the 0
Church, 0
even 0
as 0
he 0
speaks 0
of 0

decentralization 0
and 0
parreshia 0
(but 0
only 0
for 0
those 0
who 0

The 0

that 0
ultimately 0
must 0
fail 0
may 0

of 0

on 0

against 0

The 0
ex-sailor 0
is 0

that 0

was 0
subject 0
to 0
unequal 0

that 0
that 0

of 0

Saucier 0
told 0

Ex-Muslim 0

to 0
Pope 0
Francis: 0
“Naiveté 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
Islam 1
is 1
suicidal 1

very 1
dangerous” 1

“Many 0

Yes, 0
and 0
not 0
just 0
ex-Muslims. 0

It 0
has 0
become 0
a 0
superdogma 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church: 0
if 1
you 1
don’t 1
believe 1
that 1
Islam 1
is 1
a 1
Religion 1
of 1
Peace, 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
ruthlessly 1
harassed 1
and 1
silenced 1
by 1
the 1
U.S. 1
Conference 1
of 1
Catholic 1
Bishops 1
and 1
the 1
hierarchy 1
elsewhere 1
as 1
well. 1

The 1
bishops 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
are 1
much 1
more 1
concerned 1
that 1
you 1
believe 1
that 1
Islam 1
is 1
a 1
religion 1
of 1
peace 1
than 1
that 1
you 1
believe 1
in, 1

the 1

Creed. 1

And 0
the 0
Pope 0
is 0
almost 0
certain 0
to 0
ignore 0
this 0
heartfelt 0
appeal, 0
as 0
he 0
has 0
ignored 0
others 0
who 0
have 0
respectfully 0
questioned 0
his 0
departures 0
from 0
Catholic 0
teaching. 0

I 0
have 0
yet 0
to 0
meet 0

believes 0
that 0

A 0
new, 0
open 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
making 0
the 0
rounds 0
on 0
the 0
Internet, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
gathered 0
over 0
2,600 0
signatures 0
so 0
far. 0

“Most 0
Holy 0
Father,” 0
it 0
begins, 0
“‬Many 0
of 0
us 0
‬have 0
tried 0
to 0
contact 0
you, 0
‬on 0
many 0
occasions 0
‬and 0
for 0
several 0
years, 0
‬and 0
we 0
have 0
never 0
received 0
the 0
slightest 0
acknowledgement 0
of 0
our 0
letters 0
or 0
requests 0
for 0
meetings.” 0

The 0
letter 0
is 0
not 0
from 0
the 0
dubia 0
cardinals, 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
800,000 0
signers 0
of 0
the 0
2015 0
Filial 0
Appeal, 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
signatories 0
of 0
the 0
Filial 0
Correction, 0
but 0
from 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
Islamic 0
converts 0
to 0
Catholicism, 0
who 0
want 0
Francis 0
to 0
answer 0
a 0
simple 0
question: 0
why 0
did 0
they 0
literally 0
risk 0
their 0
lives 0
to 0
become 0
Catholic 0
if 0
Islam 0
is 0
“a 0
good 0
religion 0
in 0
itself” 0
as 0
the 0
pope 0
“seems 0
to 0
teach”? 0

It’s 0
a 0
question 0
he 0
refuses 0
to 0
answer, 0
despite 0
endless 0
platitudes 0
of 0
how 0
important 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
marginalized 0
and 0
to 0
accompany 0
those 0
on 0
the 0
peripheries 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
signers, 0
however, 0
are 0
not 0
dissuaded 0
in 0
their 0
pursuit 0
of 0
a 0
paternal 0
answer: 0

You 0
do 0
not 0
like 0
to 0
beat 0
around 0
the 0
bush, 0
and 0
neither 0
do 0
we, 0
so 0
allow 0
us 0
to 0
say 0
frankly 0
that 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
understand 0
your 0
teaching 0
about 0
Islam, 0
as 0
we 0
read 0
in 0
paragraphs 0
252 0
and 0
253 0
of 0
Evangelii 0
Gaudium, 0
because 0
it 1
does 1
not 1
account 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
Islam 1
came 1
AFTER 1
Christ, 1
and 1
so 1
is, 1
and 1
can 1
only 1
be, 1
an 1
Antichrist 1
(see 0
1 0
Jn 0
2.22), 0
and 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
dangerous 0
because 0
it 0
presents 0
itself 0
as 0
the 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
Revelation 0
(of 0
which 0
Jesus 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
only 0
a 0
prophet). 0

If 1
Islam 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
religion 1
in 1
itself, 1
as 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
teach, 1
why 1
did 1
we 1
become 1
Catholic? 1

Do 0
not 0
your 0
words 0
question 0
the 0
soundness 0
of 0
the 0
choice 0
we 0
made 0
at 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
our 0
lives? 0

Islam 0
prescribes 0
death 0
for 0
apostates 0
(Quran 0
4.89, 0
8.7-11), 0
do 0
you 0
know? 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
to 0
compare 0
Islamic 0
violence 0
with 0
so-called 0
Christian 0
violence? 0

“What 0
is 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
Christ 0
and 0
Satan? 0

What 0
union 0
is 0
there 0
between 0
light 0
and 0
darkness? 0

What 0
association 0
between 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
the 0
unfaithful?” 0
(2 0
Cor 0
6: 0
14-17)In 0
accordance 0
with 0
His 0
teaching 0
(Lk 0
14:26), 0
we 0
preferred 0
Him, 0
the 0
Christ, 0
to 0
our 0
own 0
life. 0

Are 0
we 0
not 0
in 0
a 0
good 0
position 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
you 0
about 0
Islam? 0

The 0
letter 0
makes 0
short 0
work 0
of 0
the 0
notion 0
that 0
Islam 0
and 0
Christianity 0
can 0
ever 0
be 0
compatible, 0
or 0
that 0
Islam 0
can 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
path 0
to 0
salvation: 0

In 0
fact, 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
Islam 0
wants 0
us 0
to 0
be 0
its 0
enemy, 0
we 0
are, 0
and 0
all 0
our 0
protestations 0
of 0
friendship 0
cannot 0
change 0
anything. 0

As 1
a 1
proper 1
Antichrist, 1
Islam 1
exists 1
only 1
as 1
an 1
enemy 1
of 1
all: 1
“Between 0
us 0
and 0
you 0
there 0
is 0
enmity 0
and 0
hatred 0
forever, 0
until 0
you 0
believe 0
in 0
Allah 0
alone!” 0
(Qur’an 0
60.4) 0
For 1
the 1
Qur’an, 1
Christians 1
“are 1
only 1
impurity” 1
(Quran 0
9.28),” 0
“the 1
worst 1
of 1
Creation” 1
(Qur’an 0
98.6), 0
all 1
condemned 1
to 1
Hell 1
(Qur’an 0
4.48), 0
so 1
Allah 1
must 1
exterminate 1
them 1
(Quran 0
9.30). 0

We 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
deceived 0
by 0
the 0
Quranic 0
verses 0
deemed 0
tolerant, 0
because 0
they 0
have 0
all 0
been 0
repealed 0
by 0
the 0
verse 0
of 0
the 0
Sword 0
(Quran 0
9.5). 0

Where 0
the 0
Gospel 0
proclaims 0
the 0
good 0
news 0
of 0
Jesus’ 0
death 0
and 0
resurrection 0
for 0
the 0
salvation 0
of 0
all, 0
and 0
the 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
the 0
Covenant 0
initiated 0
with 0
the 0
Hebrews, 0
Allah 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
offer 1
but 1
war 1
and 1
murder 1
of 1
the 1
“infidels” 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
his 1
paradise: 1
“They 0
fight 0
on 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
Allah, 0
they 0
kill 0
and 0
are 0
killed.” 0
(Quran 0
9:11) 0
We 0
do 0
not 0
confuse 0
Islam 0
with 0
Muslims, 0
but 0
if 0
for 0
you 0
“dialogue” 0
means 0
the 0
voice 0
of 0
peace, 0
for 0
Islam 0
it’s 0
only 0
another 0
way 0
to 0
make 0
war. 0

Also, 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Nazism 0
and 0
communism, 0
naiveté 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Islam 0
is 0
suicidal 0
and 0
very 0
dangerous. 0

How 0
can 0
you 0
speak 0
of 0
peace 0
and 0
endorse 0
Islam, 0
as 0
you 0
seem 0
to 0
do: 0
“To 0
wring 0
from 0
our 0
hearts 0
the 0
disease 0
that 0
plagues 0
our 0
lives 0
(…) 0
Let 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
Christians 0
do 0
it 0
with 0
the 0
Bible 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
Muslims 0
do 0
it 0
with 0
the 0
Quran. 0

“(Rome, 0
January 0
20, 0
2014)? 0

That 0
the 0
Pope 0
seems 0
to 0
propose 0
the 0
Quran 0
as 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
salvation, 0
is 0
that 0
not 0
cause 0
for 0
worry? 0

Should 0
we 0
return 0
to 0
Islam? 0

The 1
authors 1
say 1
that 1
Islam 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
ally 1
in 1
the 1
battle 1
“against 1
the 1
powers 1
that 1
want 1
to 1
dominate 1
and 1
enslave 1
the 1
world” 1
because 1
“they 1
share 1
the 1
same 1
totalitarian 1
logic 1
based 1
on 1
the 1
rejection 1
of 1
the 1
kingship 1
of 1
Christ 1
(Lk 0
4.7).” 0
They 0
contest 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
speaking 0
in 0
an 0
“Islamophilic 0
tone” 0
will 0
help 0
those 0
Christians 0
who 0
are 0
suffering 0
persecution 0
in 0
Muslim 0
countries, 0
professing 0
that 0
“apart 0
from 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Jesus 1
has 1
never 1
indicated 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
Cross, 1
so 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
find 0
our 0
joy 0
therein 0
and 0
not 0
flee 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
damned, 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
doubt 0
that 0
only 0
the 0
proclamation 0
of 0
the 0
Truth 0
brings 0
with 0
it 0
not 0
only 0
salvation, 0
but 0
freedom 0
as 0
well 0
(John 0
8.32).” 0

The 1
letter 1
also 1
contrasts 1
the 1
stance 1
of 1
Islamic 1
countries 1
like 1
Turkey 1
and 1
Saudi 1
Arabia 1
who 1
“do 1
not 1
welcome 1
any 1
refugee” 1
while 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
preaches 1

the 0
welcoming 0
of 0
migrants 0
regardless 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
Muslims, 0
something 0
forbidden 0
by 0
Apostolic 0
command: 0
“If 0
anyone 0
comes 0
to 0
you 0
but 0
refuses 0
this 0
Gospel, 0
do 0
not 0
receive 0
him 0
among 0
you 0
nor 0
greet 0
him. 0

Whoever 0
greets 0
him 0
participates 0
in 0
his 0
evil 0
works.” 0
(2 0
John 0
1.10-11); 0
“If 0
anyone 0
preaches 0
to 0
you 0
a 0
different 0
Gospel, 0
let 0
him 0
be 0
accursed!” 0
(Galatians 0
1.8-9) 0

The 0
signatories 0
go 0
on 0
to 0
give 0
voice 0
to 0
the 1
utter 1
scandal 1
of 1
the 1
pope’s 1
failure 1
to 0
carry 0
out 0
his 0
evangelical 0
mission 0
as 0
the 0
Vicar 0
of 0
Christ 0
to 0
call 0
home 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
faith: 0

The 0
pro-Islam 0
speech 0
of 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
leads 0
us 0
to 0
deplore 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Muslims 0
are 0
not 0
invited 0
to 0
leave 0
Islam, 0
and 0
that 0
many 0
ex-Muslims, 0
such 0
as 0
Magdi 0
Allam, 0
are 0
even 0
leaving 0
the 0
Church, 0
disgusted 1
by 1
her 1
cowardice, 1
wounded 1
by 1
equivocal 1
gestures, 1
confused 1
by 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
evangelization, 1
scandalized 1
by 1
the 1
praise 1
given 1
to 1
Islam 1
… 1
Thus 1
ignorant 1
souls 1
are 1
misled… 1

Taking 1
the 1
matter 1
further, 1
they 1
warn, 1
too, 1
of 1
the 1
physical 1
danger 1
the 1
pope’s 1
disposition 1
toward 1
Islam 1
invites, 1
saying 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
resulted 1
in 1
Christians 1

not 1
preparing 1
for 1
a 1
confrontation 1
with 1
Islam, 1
to 0
which 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
has 0
called 0
them 0
(Ecclesia 0
in 0
Europa, 0
No. 0

57). 0

We 0
are 0
under 0
the 0
impression 0
that 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
take 0
your 0
brother 0
Bishop 0
Nona 0
Amel, 0
Chaldean-Catholic 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Mosul 0
in 0
exile, 0
seriously, 0
when 0
he 0
tells 0
us: 0
“Our 1
present 1
sufferings 1
are 1
the 1
prelude 1
to 1
those 1
that 1
you, 1
Europeans 1
and 1
Western 1
Christians, 1
will 1
suffer 1
in 1
the 1
near 1
future. 1

I 0
have 0
lost 0
my 0
diocese. 0

The 1
headquarters 1
of 1
my 1
archdiocese 1
and 1
my 1
apostolate 1
have 1
been 1
occupied 1
by 1
radical 1
Islamists 1
who 1
want 1
us 1
to 1
convert 1
or 1
die. 1

(…) 0
You 1
are 1
welcoming 1
into 1
your 1
country 1
an 1
ever 1
increasing 1
number 1
of 1
Muslims. 1

You 1
are 1
in 1
danger 1
as 1
well. 1

You 1
must 1
make 1
strong 1
and 1
courageous 1
decisions 1
(…). 0

You 0
think 0
that 0
all 0
men 0
are 0
equal, 0
but 0
Islam 0
does 0
not 0
say 0
that 0
all 0
men 0
are 0
equal. 0

(…) 0
If 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
understand 0
this 0
very 0
quickly, 0
you 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
victims 0
of 0
the 0
enemy 0
that 0
you 0
have 0
invited 0
into 0
your 0
home.” 0
(August 0
9, 0
2014) 0
“. 0

This 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death, 1
and 1
any 1
complacency 1
towards 1
Islam 1
is 1
treasonous. 1

We 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
the 1
West 1
to 1
continue 1
with 1
Islamization, 1
nor 1
that 1
your 1

it. 1

Where 0
then 0
would 0
we 0
go 0
to 0

refuge? 0

that 0

Australia 1
'is 1

A 0
professor 0
at 0
Southern 0
New 0
Hampshire 0
University 0
failed 0
one 0
of 0
her 0
student's 0
assignments 0
because 0
the 1
professor 1
incorrectly 1
thought 1
Australia 1
"is 1
not 1
a 1
country," 1
according 0
to 0
a 0
report 0
in 0
BuzzFeed 0
News. 0

Australia 0
is, 0
in 0
fact, 0
a 0
country. 0

The 0
student, 0
Ashley 0
Arnold, 0
is 0
working 0
towards 0
an 0
online 0
sociology 0
degree 0
with 0
the 0
university. 0

For 0
one 0
of 0
her 0
final 0
assignments, 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
compare 0
a 0
social 0
norm 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
to 0
another 0
country. 0

She 0
chose 0
to 0
compare 0
social 0
media 0
use 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
to 0
what 0
it's 0
like 0
in 0
Australia. 0

The 0
professor, 0
according 0
to 0
BuzzFeed 0
News, 0
failed 0
Arnolds 0
because 0
"Australia 0
is 0
a 0
continent; 1
not 1
a 1
country," 1
which, 0
again, 0
is 0
incorrect, 0
just 1
so 1
we're 1
clear 1
here. 1

Australia 0
is 0
both 0
a 0
continent 0
and 0
a 0
country. 0

When 0
Arnold 0
complained, 0
the 0
professor 0
said 0
they'd 0
reexamine 0
the 0
assignment, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
concede 0
that 0
Australia 0
was 0
a 0
country. 0

"Australia 1
is 1
a 1
continent; 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
country. 1

That 0
error 0
made 0
it 0
nearly 0
impossible 0
for 0
you 0
to 0
accurately 0
complete 0
your 0
week 0
2 0
research 0
outline 0
correctly," 0
the 0
professor 0
wrote 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
obtained 0
by 0
BuzzFeed 0
News. 0

"As 0
I 0
mentioned 0
above 0
I 0
will 0
look 0
over 0
your 0
week 0
two 0
paper 0
once 0
again 0
and 0
see 0
if 0
you 0
earned 0
more 0
credits 0
than 0
I 0
gave 0
you." 0

In 0
another 0
email 0
exchange, 0
Arnold 0
correctly 0
asserted 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
a 0
country, 0
linking 0
to 0
the 0
"About 0
Australia" 0
section 0
of 0
the 0
country's 0
website: 0

Australia 1
is 1
both 1
a 1
country 1
and 1
a 1
continent. 1

It's 1
the 1
only 1
country 1
that 1
is 1
both. 1

I 1
provided 1
a 1
resource 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
email 1
that 1
clarifies 1
that 1
for 1
you. 1

If 1
you 1
need 1
further 1
clarification 1
google 1
or 1
the 1
SNHU 1
Shapiro 1
Library 1
has 1
that 1
information 1
you. 1

Again 0
I 0
mean 0
no 0
disrespect 0
but 0
my 0
grade 0
is 0
affected 0
by 0
your 0
assumption 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
country 0
when 0
it 0
in 0
fact 0
is. 0

Thank 0
you 0
and 0
let 0
me 0
know 0
if 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
provide 0
further 0
resources 0
proving 0
Australia 0
is 0
a 0
country. 0

The 0
professor 0
said 0
they'd 0
take 0
Arnold's 0
concerns 0
into 0
consideration. 0

"Thank 0
you 0
for 0
this 0
web-address," 0
they 0
wrote. 0

"After 0
I 0
do 0
some 0
independent 0
research 0
on 0
the 0
continent/country 0
issue 0
I 0
will 0
review 0
your 0
paper." 0

After 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
review, 0
the 0
professor 0
changed 0
Arnold's 0
grade 0
to 0
a 0
B+, 0
according 0
to 0
BuzzFeed 0

The 0

did 0
not 0

Of 0

The 0

Democratic-Farmer-Labor 0
Party 0
has 0
hired 0
attorney 0
Susan 0

in 0

the 0

said 0
it 0
is 0
looking 0
into 0
what 0
happened. 0

“All 0
allegations 0
of 0
domestic 0
abuse 0
are 0
disturbing 0
and 0
should 0
be 0
taken 0
seriously. 0

We 0
are 0
working 0
with 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
state 0
party 0
to 0
review 0
these 0

a 0
DNC 0
spokeswoman 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
Wednesday 0
morning, 0
declining 0
to 0
comment 0
further. 0

The 0
Democratic 0
Party’s 0
choice 0
of 0
Ellingstad 0
to 0
conduct 0
the 0
investigation 0
was 0
met 0
with 0
derision 0
from 0
many 0
who 0
said 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
independent, 0
including 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
Jr., 0
who 0
mocked 0
the 0
investigation 0
in 0
a 0
Tweet 0
Wednesday. 0

The 0

Ellingstad 0
works 0
for, 0
Lockridge 0
Grindal 0

has 0
a 0

both 0
Republican 0
and 0
Democratic 0
candidates, 0
including 0
Ellison, 0
according 0
to 0
Federal 0

The 0

to 0
Democrats 0

the 0
Republicans 0
by 0
a 0
margin 0
of 0
about 0
four 0
to 0
one. 0

As 0
we 0
previously 0
reported: 0

Rep. 0
Keith 0
Ellison, 0
who 0
is 0
currently 0
running 0
for 0
attorney 0
general 0
of 0
Minnesota, 0
is 0
being 0
accused 0
of 0
domestic 0
violence 0
against 0
his 0
former 0
partner 0
Karen 0
Monahan. 0

Austin 0
Monahan, 0
Karen 0
Monahan’s 0
son, 0
aired 0
the 0
allegations 0
in 0
a 0
Facebook 0
post 0
Saturday 0
night. 0

According 0
to 0
Austin 0
Monahan, 0
Ellison 0
put 0
his 0
mother 0
through 0
“pure 1
hell.” 1
In 0
the 0
Facebook 0
post, 0
he 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
video 0
of 0
Ellison 0
dragging 0
Karen 0
Monahan 0
off 0
the 0
bed 0
by 0
her 0
feet 0
while 0
screaming 0
expletives 0
at 0
her. 0

The 0
alleged 0
incident 0
is 0
just 0
one 0
of 0
several, 0
Austin 0
Monahan 0
warned. 0

State 0
Rep. 0
Debra 0
Hilstrom 0
(D-Brooklyn 0
Center) 0
was 0
quick 0
to 0
voice 0
her 0
concern 0
over 0
the 0
accusations, 0
calling 0
on 0
Ellison 0
to 0
“answer 0
these 0
allegations.” 0
DFL-endorsed 0
candidate 0
for 0
attorney 0
general 0
of 0
Minnesota 0
Matt 0
Pelikan 0
also 0
reacted 0
to 0
the 0
story, 0
calling 0
the 0
allegations 0
“extremely 1
troubling.” 1
Karen 0
Monahan 0
has 0
also 0
hinted 0
at 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
telling 0
Ellison 0
that 0
her 0
“kids, 0
job, 0
health, 0
finances, 0
humanity 0
was 0
deeply 0
impacted 0
by 0
the 0
abuse 0
you 0
are 0
well 0
aware 0
of.” 0
Karen 0
Monahan 0
claims 0
she 0
has 0
videos, 0
recordings, 0
and 0
messages 0
to 0
prove 0
her 0
story. 0

Ellison 0
has 0
admitted 0
the 0
relationship, 0
but 0
is 0
denying 0
the 0
abuse. 0

And 0
the 0
relationship 0
was 0
clearly 0
real. 0

Karen 0
Monahan, 0
an 0
organizer 0
with 0
the 0
Sierra 0
Club, 0
was 0
in 0
a 0
relationship 0
with 0
Ellison 0
for 0
years. 0

The 0
two 0
are 0
seen 0
together 0
in 0
many 0
of 0
her 0
social 0
media 0
posts, 0
including 0
hiking 0
in 0
together 0
national 0
parks 0
and 0
posing 0
with 0
the 0
Obamas 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Records 0
show 0
she 0
lived 0
in 0
his 0
Minneapolis 0
home 0
before 0
their 0
relationship 0
ended. 0

Ellison, 0
who 0
was 0
previously 0
married 0
to 0
a 0
different 0
woman, 0
is 0
divorced. 0

It's 0
hard 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
really 0
happened 0
in 0
a 0
relationship. 0

And 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
kept 0
it 0
quiet. 0

"Keith 0
Ellison 0
flatly 0
denies 0
allegation 0
that 0
he 0
abused 0
an 0
ex 0
girlfriend. 0

The 0
story 0
had 0
been 0
circulating 0
in 0
MN, 0
and 0
not 0
held 0
up 0
under 0
media 0
scrutiny, 0
so 0
no 0
stories 0
ran. 0

It 0
blew 0
up 0
last 0
night 0
after 0
the 0
ex’s 0
son 0
posted 0
the 0
allegation 0
on 0
Facebook." 0

Dave 0
Weigel. 0

It's 0
not 0
quite 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
for 0
Keith 0
X. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
Ellison 0
has 0
faced 0
misconduct 0
allegations. 0

In 0
2006, 0
a 0
woman 0
named 0
Amy 0
Alexandar 0
claimed 0
that 0
Ellison 0
ostracized 0
her 0
and 0
smeared 0
her 0
name 0
after 0
having 0
an 0
extramarital 0
affair 0
with 0
her 0
in 0
the 0
1990s 0
and 0
then 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
2000s. 0

Ellison 0
in 0
2005 0
filed 0
a 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
her 0
after 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
phone 0
and 0
email 0
harassment. 0

She 0
subsequently 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
him, 0
which 0
a 0
judge 0
denied, 0
ordering 0
her 0
to 0
stop 0
repeating 0
allegations 0
of 0
an 0
affair 0
or 0
intimidation. 0

Ellison 0
subsequently 0
agreed 0
to 0
dismiss 0
his 0
restraining 0
order 0
against 0
her 0
if 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
contacted 0
him. 0

I'm 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
damage 0
control 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
elections. 0

Ellison 0
won 0
the 0
primary 0
days 0
after 0
the 0
allegations 0
were 0
made 0
public. 0

Of 0
course, 0
accusations 0
does 0
not 0
make 0
one 0
guilty 0
for 0
Ellison 0
anymore 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
for 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

However, 0
at 0
least 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Ellison, 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
women 0
were 0
not 0
scared 0
about 0
their 0
reputation 0
and 0
had 0
any 0
political 0
motive 0
to 0
call 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
file 0
a 0
report. 0

When 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Ellison 0
though, 0
we 0
know 0
he 0
is 0
an 0
effeminate 1
pansy 1
who 0
simply 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
answer 0
to 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
and 0
even 0
seeks 0
security 0
to 0
hide 0
from 0
a 0
female 0
report 0
with 0
a 0
mic 0
and 0
a 0
camera. 0

faced 0
it 0
all 0
and 0
fought 0
back 0
against 0
it. 0

Attorney 0
General 0
Sessions 0
recused 0
himself 0
from 0
overseeing 0
the 0
investigation 0
early 0
in 0
2017. 0

The 0

Times 0
hypothesized 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
done, 0
in 0
part, 0
to 0
avoid 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
conflicts 0
such 0
as 0
that 0
which 0
Trump 0
has 0
proposed. 0

Later, 0
a 0

Robert 0
S. 0
Mueller 0
III, 0
was 0
appointed 0
to 0
carry 0
out 0

Trump’s 0
lawyers, 0
Rudolph 0
W. 0

Jay 0
A. 0

in 0
a 0

that 0
the 0

was 0
not 0
ordering 0
the 0
inquiry 0
closed 0
but 0
simply 0
expressing 0
his 0
opinion 0
via 0
the 0
social 0
media 0
platform. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
a 0

to 0

Mr. 0

said, 0
adding 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
sentiment 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
lawyers 0
have 0
expressed 0
publicly 0
before. 0

“He’s 0
expressing 0
his 0

but 0
he’s 0
not 0

as 0

“He 0
doesn’t 0

obstruction. 0

Plan 0
of 0
Comprehensive 0
Action 0
(JCPOA), 0
as 0
the 0

is 0
formally 0
known. 0

The 0
JCPOA’s 0
fundamental 0
flaws 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
wants 0
fixed 0
include 0
Iran’s 0
ability 0
to 0
block 0
unfettered 0
international 0
inspections, 0
the 0
wiggle 0
room 0
that 0
Iran 0
is 0
exploiting 0
to 0
continue 0
developing 0
and 0
testing 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
capable 0
of 0
delivering 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
and 0
the 0
sunset 0
clause 0
on 0
nuclear 0
enrichment 0
that 0
would 0
provide 0
Iran 0
a 0
clear 0
path 0
to 0
becoming 0
a 0
nuclear 0
armed 0
state 0
after 0
the 0
current 0
restrictions 0
are 0
lifted. 0

Obama 0
and 0
Kerry 0
had 0
promised 0
that 0
these 0
issues 0
would 0
be 0
dealt 0
with 0
satisfactorily 0
before 0
agreeing 0
to 0
the 0
final 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

Instead 0
they 0
caved 0
to 0
Iranian 0
pressure 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
deal 0
done. 0

Now 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
is 0
trying 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
the 1
mess 1
Obama 0
and 0
Kerry 0
left 0
him, 0
Kerry 0
has 0
the 0
gall 0
to 0
label 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
decision 0
a 0
"reckless 1
abandonment 1
of 1
facts 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
ego 1
and 1
ideology" 1
and 0
to 0
accuse 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
of 0
“lying 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people.” 1
It 1
was 1
the 1
Obama 1
administration 1
that 1
recklessly 1
abandoned 1
the 1
facts 1
in 1
pressing 1
ahead 1
with 1
the 1
deal. 1

The 1
Obama 1
administration 1
lied 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people, 1
abandoning 0
its 0
own 0
promises 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
deal 0
contained 0
ironclad 0
protections. 0

Moreover, 0
all 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
done 0
so 0
far 0
is 0
to 0
return 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
to 0
Congress 0
for 0
review. 0

Had 0
Obama 0
followed 0
the 0
Constitution 0
and 0
submitted 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
as 0
a 0
treaty 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
in 0
its 0
present 0
form 0
almost 0
certainly 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
approved. 0

Congress 0
should 0
now 0
have 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
revisit 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
protections 0
that 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
promised 0
are 0
working 0
as 0
advertised. 0

Congress 0
should 0
also 0
consider 0
whether 0
time 0
limits 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
commitments 0
continue 0
to 0
make 0
sense 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
are 0
now 0
experiencing 0
with 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
technology 0
collaborator, 0
North 0
Korea. 0

It 0
bought 0
time 0
to 0
turn 0
into 0
a 0
full-fledged 0
nuclear 0
power 0
under 0
our 0
noses. 0

Kerry 0
had 0
promised 0
that 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
would 0
be 0
prohibited 0
from 0
testing 0
ballistic 0
missiles. 0

This 0
turned 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
lie. 0

After 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
was 0
finalized, 0
with 0
no 0
such 0
prohibition 0
included, 0
Iran 0
continued 0
to 0
test 0
such 0
missiles. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
response 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
had 0
become 0
a 0
separate 0
issue, 0
to 0
be 0
dealt 0
with 0
under 0
a 0
new 0
United 0
Nations 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution 0
endorsing 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

The 0
new 0
resolution 0
replaced 0
clear 0
prohibitions 0
imposed 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
program 0
with 0
a 0
weak 0
declaration 0
in 0
an 0
annex 0
that 0
simply 0
“calls 0
upon” 0
Iran 0
not 0
to 0
undertake 0
any 0
activity 0
such 0
as 0
development 0
and 0
test 0
launches 0
related 0
to 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
designed 0
to 0
be 0
capable 0
of 0
delivering 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
for 0
eight 0
years. 0

Iran 0
has 0
tested 0
several 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
during 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
including 0
two 0
Qadr 0
H 0
missiles 0
with 0
the 0
phrase 0
“Israel 1
must 1
be 1
wiped 1
out” 1
emblazoned 0
on 0
the 0
sides. 0

The 0
commander 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
Army, 0
Major 0
General 0
Ataollah 0
Salehi, 0
had 0
told 0
reporters 0
just 0
a 0
month 0
before 0
the 0
launch 0
of 0
those 0
missiles 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
"neither 0
paying 0
any 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
resolutions 0
against 0
Iran, 0
nor 0
implementing 0
them. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
breach 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA.” 0

Russian 0
Ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
Vitaly 0
Churkin, 0
spurning 0
requests 0
from 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
to 0
impose 0
sanctions 0
against 0
Iran 0
under 0
the 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution, 0
asserted 0
that 0
the 0
Iranian 0
missile 0
test 0
did 0
not 0
violate 0
the 0
resolution. 0

“A 0
call 0
is 0
different 0
from 0
a 0
ban 0
so 0
legally 0
you 0
cannot 0
violate 0
a 0
call, 0
you 0
can 0
comply 0
with 0
a 0
call 0
or 0
you 0
can 0
ignore 0
the 0
call, 0
but 0
you 0
cannot 0
violate 0
a 0
call,” 0
the 0
Russian 0
ambassador 0
said. 0

In 0
short, 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
did 0
not 0
cover 0
the 0
missile 0
tests 0
and 0
the 0
replacement 0
UN 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution 0
that 0
did 0
mention 0
the 0
missiles 0
is 0
toothless. 0

Deputy 0
National 0
Security 0
Advisor 0
Ben 0
Rhodes 0
told 0
CNN, 0
during 0
an 0
interview 0
aired 0
on 0
April 0
6, 0
2015, 0
that 0
under 0
the 0
deal’s 0
terms 0
then 0
still 0
being 0
negotiated, 0
“you 0
will 0
have 0
anywhere, 0
anytime, 0
24/7 0
access 0
as 0
it 0
relates 0
to 0
the 0
nuclear 0
facilities 0
that 0
Iran 0
has." 0

Rhodes 0
claimed 0
that 0
“if 0
we 0
see 0
a 0
site 0
that 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
inspect 0
on 0
a 0
military 0
facility, 0
we 0
can 0
get 0
access 0
to 0
that 0
site 0
and 0
inspect 0
it. 0

So 0
if 0
it's 0
a 0
suspicious 0
site 0
that 0
we 0
believe 0
is 0
related 0
to 0
its 0
nuclear 0
efforts, 0
we 0
can 0
get 0
access 0
and 0
inspect 0
that 0
site 0
through 0
the 0
IAEA.” 0
This 1
was 1
another 1
lie. 1

After 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
was 0
finalized 0
in 0
July 0
2015, 0
Rhodes 0
shamelessly 1
denied 1
that 0
anytime, 0
anywhere 0
inspections 0
were 0
ever 0
considered 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
negotiations. 0

“We 0
never 0
sought 0
in 0
this 0
negotiation 0
the 0
capacity 0
for 0
so-called 0
anytime, 0
anywhere,” 0
Rhodes 0
said 0
on 0
July 0
14, 0
2015. 0

The 0
JCPOA’s 0
supporters, 0
including 0
Kerry, 0
have 0
made 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
International 0
Atomic 0
Energy 0
Agency 0
(IAEA) 0
has 0
on 0
several 0
occasions 0
verified 0
Iran’s 0
compliance 0
with 0
its 0
commitments 0
under 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
keeping 0
its 0
stock 0
of 0
low-enriched 0
uranium 0
below 0
the 0
limit 0
set 0
forth 0
in 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
and 0
not 0
pursuing 0
further 0
construction 0
of 0
the 0
Arak 0
reactor. 0

Iran 0
was 0
found 0
to 0
have 0
slightly 0
exceeded 0
the 0
limit 0
on 0
its 0
stock 0
of 0
heavy 0
water, 0
but 0
has 0
remedied 0
the 0
problem 0
to 0
the 0
IAEA’s 0
satisfaction. 0

IAEA 0
chief 0
Yukiya 0
Amano 0
reiterated 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
he 0
issued 0
on 0
October 0
9th 0
that 0
Iran 0
has 0
remained 0
in 0
compliance 0
with 0
its 0
JCPOA 0
commitments. 0

The 0
problem, 0
as 0
any 0
clear-eyed 0
observer 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
recognizes, 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
IAEA 0
relies 0
on 0
Iran 0
for 0
self-inspection 0
of 0
certain 0
sites 0
that 0
the 0
regime 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
the 0
IAEA 0
to 0
inspect 0
freely 0
on 0
its 0
own. 0

IAEA 0
inspectors 0
have 0
avoided 0
examining 0
military 0
sites 0
it 0
knows 0
exists 0
and 0
has 0
no 0
reliable 0
way 0
of 0
tracking 0
undeclared 0
sites. 0

The 0
IAEA’s 0
explanation 0
for 0
not 0
visiting 0
any 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
known 0
military 0
sites 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
“no 0
reason 0
to 0
ask” 0
for 0
access. 0

Evidently, 0
the 0
IAEA 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
block 0
out 0
the 0
fact 0

before 0

happen 0
again. 0

The 0

knows 0
not 0
to 0
ask. 0

As 0
to 0
the 0
JCPOA’s 0
sunset 0
provisions, 0
the 0
Obama 1
administration 1
lied 1
about 1
that 1
too. 1

Kerry 0
claimed 0
on 0
September 0
2, 0
2015 0
that 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
“never 0
sunsets. 0

There’s 0
no 0
sunset 0
in 0
this 0
agreement.” 0

This 0
month 0
Kerry 0
has 0
resorted 0
to 0
parsing 0
words. 0

He 0
claims 0
the 0
phrase 0
'sunset 0
provisions' 0
is 0
a 0
“misnomer,” 0
before 0
then 0
defending 0
the 0
JCPOA’s 0
time 0
limits. 0

"We 0
were 0
comfortable 0
because 0
the 0
cap 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
low-enriched 0
uranium 0
stockpile 0
remains 0
in 0
place 0
until 0
2030,” 0
Kerry 0
wrote 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
late 0
last 0
month. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
let’s 1
just 1
kick 1
the 1
can 1
down 1
the 1
road 1
and 0
hope 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
reasonable 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
in 0
13 0
years 0
that 0
would 0
agree 0
to 0
extend 0
the 0
time 0
limits. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Kerry 0
advises 0
us 0
not 0
to 0
worry. 0

Kerry 0
declared, 0
“15 0
or 0
25 0
years 0
from 0
now, 0
we 0
still 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
military 0
options 0
we 0
have 0
today.” 0

John 0
Kerry 0
has 0
obviously 0
learned 0
nothing 0
from 0
the 0
North 0
Korean 0
fiasco, 1
which 0
resulted 0
from 0
years 0
of 0
phony 1
agreements 1
with 0
the 0
rogue 0
regime 0
and 0
so-called 0
“strategic 0
patience.” 0
The 0
United 0
States 0
clearly 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
military 0
options 0
today 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
a 0
nuclear 0
armed 0
North 0
Korea 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
23 0
years 0
ago 0
when 0
former 0
President 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
use 0
military 0
force 0
to 0
stamp 0
out 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
nuclear 0
program 0
at 0
its 0
inception. 0

Instead, 0
Clinton 0
started 0
us 0
down 0
the 0
primrose 0
path 0
of 0
naïve 0
diplomacy 0
with 0
a 0
duplicitous 0
regime 0
that 0
now 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
verge 0
of 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
strike 0
the 0
U.S. 0
mainland 0
with 0
nuclear 0
warheads 0
delivered 0
by 0
intercontinental 0
ballistic 0
missiles. 0

It 0
is 0
precisely 0
because 0
North 1
Korea’s 1
actions 1
over 1
the 1
last 1
23 1
years 1
have 1
proven 1
that 1
making 1
concessions 1
to 1
a 1
rogue 1
regime 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
obtain 1
denuclearization 1
commitments 1
is 1
so 1
dangerous 1
that 1
President 1
Trump 1
does 1
not 1
want 1
to 1
make 1
the 1
same 1
mistake 1
with 1
Iran. 1

America’s 0
European 0
allies 0
are 0
also 0
upset 0
with 0
President 0
Trump 0
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
recertify 0
the 0
deal 0
and 0
threatening 0
to 0
pull 0
out 0
if 0
certain 0
conditions 0
are 0
not 0
met. 0

British 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Theresa 0
May, 0
French 0
President 0
Emmanuel 0
Macron 0
and 0
German 0
Chancellor 0
Angela 0
Merkel 0
issued 0
a 0
joint 0
statement 0
last 0
Friday 0
praising 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
and 0
its 0
implementation. 0

They 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran 0
was 0
“the 0
culmination 0
of 0
13 0
years 0
of 0
diplomacy 0
and 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
step 0
towards 0
ensuring 0
that 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
programme 0
is 0
not 0
diverted 0
for 0
military 0
purposes. 0

Therefore, 0
we 0
encourage 0
the 1
US 1
Administration 1
and 1
Congress 1
to 1
consider 1
the 1
implications 1
to 1
the 1
security 1
of 1
the 1
US 1
and 1
its 1
allies 1
before 1
taking 1
any 1
steps 1
that 1
might 1
undermine 1
the 1
JCPOA, 1
such 1
as 1
re-imposing 1
sanctions 1
on 1
Iran 1
lifted 1
under 1
the 1
agreement.” 1

Perhaps 0
these 0
European 0
leaders 0
should 0
remember 0
their 0
own 0
history. 0

Appeasement 1
through 1
phony 1
deals 1
with 1
a 1
rogue 1
dictatorship 1
does 1
not 1
work, 1
as 1
proven 1
by 1

infamous 1

Muslims 0
anxious 0
to 0

have 0
found 0

critically, 0
all 0
too 0

campaign 0
by 0
U.S.-based 0
Islamic 0
organizations 0

that 0

We 0
have 0
seen 0
this 0
just 0
recently, 0
when 0
Mountain 0
Ridge 0
Middle 0
School 0
in 0
Gerrardstown, 0
West 0
Virginia 0
instructed 0
students 0
to 0
copy 0
out 0
the 0
Islamic 0
profession 0
of 0
faith 0
(shahada), 0
ostensibly 0
as 0
a 0
calligraphy 0
exercise. 0

Parent 0
Rich 0
Penkoski 0
recounted: 0
“I 0
saw 0
the 0
assignment 0
of 0
writing 0
the 0
Shahada 0
in 0
Arabic. 0

Their 0
excuse 0
was 0
calligraphy. 0

I 0
was 0
like, 0
‘Whoa! 1

Whoa! 1

Whoa!’ 1
First 0
of 0
all, 0
calligraphy 0
was 0
invented 0
in 0
China 0
3,000 0
years 0
prior 0
to 0
Muhammad. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
my 0
daughter 0
to 0
write 0
that 0
disturbed 0
me. 0

I 0
said, 0
‘That 0
is 0
not 0
happening. 0

My 0
daughter 0
is 0
not 0
doing 0
that.’ 0
My 0
daughter 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
if 0
she 0
didn’t 0
do 0
the 0
assignment, 0
then 0
she 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
[detention] 0
slip.” 0

Branch 0
contradicted 0
Penkoski, 0
claiming: 0
“The 0
teacher 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
several 0
times 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
study 0
of 0
world 0
religions 0
and 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
trying 0
to 0
advocate 0
for 0
any 0
religion 0
over 0
another. 0

She 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
had 0
questions 0
about 0
religious 0
beliefs, 0
that 0
those 0
conversations 0
should 0
take 0
place 0
with 0
their 0
parents.” 0
He 0
said 0
that 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
were 0
given 0
“equitable 0
treatment” 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
class. 0

Penkoski’s 0
daughter, 0
Brielle, 0
however, 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
class 0
spent 0
much 0
less 0
time 0
on 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
than 0
it 0
did 0
on 0
Islam. 0

Penkoski 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
accompanying 0
exercises 0
were 0
also 0
less 0
extensive 0
for 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
than 0
they 0
were 0
for 0
Islam: 0
“Notice 0
no 0
Bible 0
verses, 0
no 0
reciting 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments 0
or 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer. 0

[There’s] 0
no 0
practicing 0
writing 0
in 0
Hebrew 0
as 0
compared 0
to 0
the 0
Islamic 0
packet.” 0

This 0
stealth 0
proselytizing 1
is 0
nationwide. 0

Last 0
January, 0
parents 0
filed 0
a 0
federal 0
complaint 0
against 0
Chatham 0
Middle 0
School 0
in 0
Chatham, 0
New 0
Jersey, 0
for 0
forcing 0
students 0
to 0
watch 0
videos 0
that 0
proselytized 1
for 0
Islam. 0

One 0
video, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
complaint, 0
describes 0
“Christians 0
and 0
Jews 0
as 0
‘infidels’ 1
and 0
prais[es] 0
Muhammad 0
in 0
gruesome 1
detail 0
for 0
slaughtering 1
them.” 0
Parent 0
Libby 0
Hilsenrath 0
characterized 0
the 0
accompanying 0
assignment 0
as 0
“replete 0
with 0
biased, 0
chastising 1
statements 0
encouraging 0
the 0
students…to 0
follow 0
the 0
Quran 0
and 0
become 0
Muslim.” 0
Another 0
video, 0
according 0
to 0
Hilsenrath, 0
depicts 0
a 0
Muslim 0
boy 0
teaching 0
his 0
non-Muslim 0
friend 0
about 0
Islam, 0
after 0
which 0
both 0
go 0
to 0
“learn 0
how 0
to 0
pray.” 0

The 0
complaint 0
adds: 0
“Due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
these 0
doctrinal 0
messages 0
calling 0
for 0
conversion 0
to 0
Islam 0
were 0
included 0
in 0
video 0
format 0
with 0
vivid 0
images 0
and 0
text, 0
they 0
possess 0
greater 0
communicative 0
impact 0
and 0
are 0
more 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
accepted 0
by 0
the 0
students 0
viewing 0
them 0
than 0
information 0
that 0
is 0
spoken 0
in 0
a 0
classroom 0
or 0
even 0
written 0
in 0
a 0

2017, 0

Muslims 0
in 0
the 0
‘Islamic’ 0
city 0
of 0
Jerusalem 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
class 0
assignment.” 0
The 0
assignment 0
also 0
included 0
a 0
pro-Palestinian, 0
anti-Israel 0
article. 0

Judicial 0
Watch 0
Senior 0
Investigator 0
Bill 0
Marshall 0
remarked: 0
“Citizens 0

have 0
been 0
waging 0
a 0
minor 0
war 0
with 0
school 0
officials 0

trying 0
to 0
get 0

to 0
use 0

in 0
their 0
teaching 0
materials 0
on 0
the 0

Dr. 0
Bill 0
Saxton, 0
chairman 0
of 0
Citizens 0
for 0
National 0
Security, 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
assignment 0
was 0
a 0
“purposeful 0

“It 0

half 0
the 0

Kim 0
Embry, 0
a 0
spokesperson 0
for 0
Walton 0
County 0
Public 0

revealingly: 0
“We 0

the 0

stuff 0
that 0

Indeed. 0

In 0
2015, 0
students 0
at 0
Spring 0
Hill 0
Middle 0
School 0
in 0
Spring 0
Hill, 0
Tennessee 0
were 0
forced 1
as 0
part 0
of 0
an 0
assignment 0
to 0
write, 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
god 0
but 0
Allah; 0
Muhammad 0
is 0
his 0
prophet.” 0
Mother 0
Joy 0
Ellis 0
remarked: 0
“This 0
is 0
a 0
seventh 0
grade 0
state 0
standard, 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
TCAP. 0

I 0
didn’t 0
have 0
a 0
problem 0
with 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
Islam 0
being 0
taught, 0
but 0
to 0
go 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
make 0
my 0
child 0
write 0
the 0
Shahada, 0
is 0
unacceptable.” 1
Another 0
mother, 0
Brandee 0
Porterfield, 0
observed: 0
“It 0
really 0
did 0
bother 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
skipped 0
the 0
whole 0
chapter 0
on 0
the 0
rise 0
of 0
Christianity 0
and 0
they 0
spent 0
three 0
weeks 0
just 0
studying 0
Islam….I 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
teacher 0
and 0
the 0
principal,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“They 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
learn 0
any 0
other 0
religion, 0
doctrines 0
or 0
creeds 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
back 0
over 0
this 0
chapter. 0

Even 0
though 0
they 0
discuss 0
Christianity 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
during 0
the 0
Middle 0
Ages, 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
ever 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
this 0
basis 0
for 0
Judaism 0
or 0
Christianity 0
later.” 0

Maury 0
County 0
Director 0
of 0
Schools, 0
Chris 0
Marczak, 0
defended 0
the 0
curriculum: 0
“It 0
is 0
our 0
job 0
as 0
a 0
public 0
school 0
system 0
to 0
educate 0
our 0
students 0
on 0
world 0
history 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
be 0
ready 0
to 0
compete 0
in 0
a 0
global 0
society, 0
not 0
to 0
endorse 0
one 0
religion 0
over 0
another 0
or 0
indoctrinate.” 1
Porterfield, 0
however, 0
shot 0
back: 0
“They 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
over 0
anything 0
else. 0

So 0
for 0
the 0
students 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
memorize 0
this 0
prayer, 0
it 0
does 0
seem 0
like 0
it 0
is 0
indoctrination.” 1

None 0
of 0
the 0
encroachments 0
of 0
Islam 0
in 0
public 0
schools 0
should 0
come 0
as 0
any 0
real 0
surprise. 0

Multiculturalism, 0
after 0
all, 0
amounts 0
to 0
respect 0
for 0
every 0
culture 0
except 0
one’s 0
own. 0

The 0
embarrassment, 0
regret, 0
and 0
even 0
self-hatred 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
inculcated 0
in 0
American 0
public 0
school 0
students 0
for 0
decades 0
now 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
vacuum, 0
which 0
Muslims 0
have 0
shown 0
themselves 0
to 0
be 0
all 0
too 0
eager 0
to 0
fill. 0

Certainly, 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
furthering 0
the 0
Islamization 0
of 0
the 0
schools 0
would 0
deny 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
see 0
Islamic 0
law 0
implemented 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and 0
would 0
indignantly 0
reject 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
their 0
efforts 0
were 0
furthering 0
that 0
end 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

They 0
would 0
say 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
doing 0
it 0
all 0
for 0
tolerance, 0
pluralism, 0
and 0
multiculturalism. 0

Unfortunately, 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
it 0
amounts 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
thing. 0

that 0

How 0

that 0
the 0
two 0

will 0
be 0
the 0

for 0
six 0

never 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
a 0
global 0
homosexual 0
clergy 1
predation 1
scandal 1
is 0
erupting 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
when 0
Francis 0
wants 0
the 0
Synod 0
to 0
minimize 0
that 0
nagging 0
and 0
unmerciful 0
Catholic 0
catechism 0
doctrine 0
of 0
homosexuality 0
as 0
“intrinsically 1
disordered” 1
by 0
exploiting 0
the 0
naive 0
views 0
of 0
the 0

at 0
the 0

How 1

that 0

is 0
bankrupting 0
the 0
American 0

and 0
the 0
Instrumentum 0

Agenda, 0
embraces 0
the 0
relaxation 0
of 0

How 1

that 0
the 0

in 0
the 0

that: 0

“Some 0

global 0
prelate 0

coverup 0

the 0
2018 0
Synodal 0
Bishop 0
Conferences 0
are 0
exploring 0
for 0
ways 0
during 0

to 0
discuss 0
ways 0
in 0
which 0
homosexual 0
youths 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
“closer” 0
to 0
the 0
Church! 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
since 0
2013 0
during 0
Francis’ 0
impromptu 0
airplane 0
presser 0
when 0
he 0
cleverly 0
sent 0
a 0
powerful 0
message 0
to 0
homosexual 0
clerics, 0
“Who 1
Am 1
I 1
to 1
Judge,” 1
now 0
Francis 0
must 0
judge 0
the 0
criminal 0
predatory 0
conduct 0
of 0
homosexual 0
clergy 0
and 0
prelates 0
who 0
preyed 0
on 0
youth 0
and 0
seminarians. 0

The 0
emerging 0
homosexual 0
clergy 0
scandal 0
is 0
just 0
beginning 0
to 0
unfold. 0

The 0
laity 0
will 0
learn 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
next 0
few 0
years 0
that 0
the 0
underlying 0
cause 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
scandal 0
lies 0
in 0
the 0
homosexual 0
network 0
of 0
priests, 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
who 0
preyed 0
on 0
the 0
youth, 0
assaulted 0
seminarians, 0
promoted 0
their 0
own 0
ilk, 0
and 0
punished 0
any 0
whistleblowers 0
or 0
noncompliant 0
priests. 0

Here 0
is 0
the 0
dirty 1
secret 0
that 0
is 0
now 0
emerging. 0

Many 0
in 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
were 0
active 0
homosexuals 0
who 0
intentionally 0
relaxed 0
and 0
ignored 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
and 0
moral 0
stance 0
on 0
homosexuality. 0

The 0
personal 0
wreckage 0
brutally 1
portrayed 0
in 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
Grand 0
Jury 0
Report 0
is 0
the 0
direct 0
result 0
of 0
a 0
clerical 0
culture 0
which 0
embraced 0
homosexuality 0
and 0
groomed, 0
recruited, 0
and 0
assaulted 0
young 0
people 0
into 0
this 0
sordid 1
lifestyle. 0

Many 0
priests, 0
bishops, 0
and 0
cardinals 0
practiced 0
what 0
Francis 0
preached, 0
‘who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge.’ 1

The 0
result? 0

A 0
litany 0
of 0
lives 0
of 0
total 0
moral, 0
physical, 0
emotional 0
devastation 1
suffered 0
by 0
victims 0
of 0
homosexual 0
clerics. 0

This 0
is 0
just 0
the 0
very 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
dark 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
soul 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

The 0
upcoming 0
Synod 0
and 0
its 0
embrace 0
of 0
the 0
“LGBT” 0
lifestyle 0
makes 0
a 1
mockery 1
of 0
the 0
suffering 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
victims 0
and 0
justifies 0
the 0
decades-old 0
scandal. 0

Be 0
forewarned 0
that 0
inviting 0
young 0
people 0
from 0
ages 0
16-29 0
to 0
the 0
Synod 0
to 0
discuss 0
vocations 0
with 0
Bishops 0
poses 1
serious 1
moral 1
and 1
physical 1
dangers 1
to 0
these 0
unsuspecting 0
youth, 0
many 0
of 0
whom 0
think 0
homosexuality 0
is 0
cool. 0

And 0
the 0
Bishops 0
know 0
it. 0

The 0
full 0
extent 0
of 0
the 0
clerical 1
predation 1
in 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
will 0
take 0
years 0
to 0
uncover. 0

Until 0
it 0
has, 0
this 0
Synod 0
must 0
be 0
cancelled 0
while 0
the 0
civil 0
authorities 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
fully 0
investigate 0
the 0
breadth 0
and 0
depth 0
of 0
the 0
homosexual 0
clerical 0
predation. 0

The 0
warning 0
signs 0
and 0
rainbow 0
flags 0
are 0
flamboyantly 0
flashing 0
that 0
the 0
2018 0
Synod 0
on 0
the 0
Youth 0
and 0
Vocations 0
in 0
Rome 0
presents 0
great 0
moral 0
and 0
physical 0
exploitation 0
of 0
the 0
youth. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican, 0
the 0
chosen 0
topic 0
of 0
the 0
2018 0
Synod, 0
is 0
an 0
“expression 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
young,” 0
and 0
is 0
in 0
continuity 0
with 0
the 0
findings 0
of 0
the 0
two-fold 0
synod 0
on 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
Francis’s 0
post-synodal 0
document 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

We’ve 0
caught 0
on 0
to 0
his 0
sneaky 1
synodal 0
tactics. 0

Francis 0
cleverly 0
uses 0
the 0
synodal 0
process 0
to 0
relax 0
church 0
doctrine 0
by 0
employing 0
secular 0
tools 0
of 0
surveys 0
and 0
focus 0
groups. 0

And, 0
if 0
the 0
necessary 0
results 0
aren’t 0
computed, 0
they 0
will 0
skewer 0
the 0
results. 0

Magisterium 0
by 0
majority 0
vote 0
or 0
stuff 0
the 0

The 0
only 0
compelling 0
“expression 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
young” 0
belongs 0
in 0
the 0
full 0
and 0
transparent 0
cooperation 0
of 0
criminal 0
investigations 0
into 0
predatory 1
homosexual 1
predation. 1

Muhammad 0
said, 0

It 0
absolutely 0

Reached 0
by 0

on 0
Thursday, 0
Muhammad 0
said 0
a 0
“staff 0
member” 0
for 0
the 0
CBC 0
contacted 0
him 0
“sort 1
of 1
in 1
a 1
panic” 1
after 0
he 0
took 0
the 0
photo 0
at 0
a 0
caucus 0
meeting 0
in 0
2005. 0

TPM 0
has 0
published 0
the 0
photo 0
above 0
with 0
Muhammad’s 0
permission. 0

“I 0
sort 0
of 0
understood 0
what 0
was 0
going 0
on,” 0
Muhammad 0
told 0
TPM. 0

“I 0
promised 0
and 0
made 0
arrangements 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
picture 0
to 0
Leonard 0
Farrakhan,” 0
the 0
minister’s 0
son-in-law 0
and 0
chief 0
of 0
staff. 0

Muhammad 0
said 0
he 0
gave 0
away 0
“the 0
disk” 0
from 0
his 0
camera 0
but 0
“copied 0
the 0
photograph 0
from 0
that 0
day 0
onto 0
a 0
file” 0
on 0
his 0
computer. 0

“Realizing 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
given 0
it 0
up, 0
I 0
mean, 0
it 0
was 0
sort 0
of 0
like 0
a 0
promise 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
photograph 0
secret,” 0
Muhammad 0
said. 0

Muhammad 0
said 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
release 0
his 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
photograph 0
because 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
perceived 0
as 0
a 0
betrayal 0
of 0
that 0
promise: 0
“I 0
was 0
really, 0
I 0
guess, 0
afraid 0
of 0
them.” 0

Malcolm 0
X 0
wasn’t 0
adequately 0
afraid 0
of 0
them. 0

Here’s 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
him: 0

https://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI 0

Muhammad 0
said 0
he 0
thought 0
the 0
photograph 0
would 0
be 0
“damaging 0
politically” 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
released 0
and 0
was 1
afraid 1
that 1
someone 1
might 1
“break 1
into 1
his 1
apartment” 1
looking 1
for 1
it, 1
like 0
“that 0
Watergate 0
crap.” 1
He 0
said 0
he 0
“felt 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
more 0
at 0
ease” 0
after 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
2016 0
claimed 0
that 0
Obama 0
visited 0
his 0
home 0
in 0
Chicago. 0

Muhammad 0
contacted 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
autumn 0
2017 0
with 0
the 0
“final 0
manuscript” 0
for 0
a 0
self-published 0
book 0
containing 0
the 0
photo. 0

“I 0
sent 0
him 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
manuscript 0
suggesting 0
that, 0
showing 0
him 0
the 0
picture, 0
and 0
saying 0
to 0
him, 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
object, 0
I 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
publish 0
it,” 0
Muhammad 0
said. 0

“He 0
had 0
no 0
objection.” 0
… 0
During 0
Obama’s 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
conservatives 0
pushed 0
multiple 0
apparently 0
racially 0
motivated 0
conspiracy 0
theories 0
about 0
Obama’s 0
religion 0
and 0
supposed 0
ties 0
to 0
Islam. 0

For 0
example, 0
in 0
Obama’s 0
memoir 0
subtitled 0
A 0
Story 0
of 0
Race 0
and 0
Inheritance, 0
Obama 0
recounts 0
his 0
being 0
a 0
regular 0
reader 0
of 0
Minister 0
Farrakhan’s 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
newspaper 0
The 0
Final 0
Call. 0

Obama 0
recollects 0
Farrakhan’s 0
black 0
nationalist 0
capitalist 0
campaign 0
to 0
get 0
black 0
people 0
to 0
use 0
toothpaste 0
manufactured 0
by 0
black-owned 0
businesses. 0

Farrakhan’s 0
eventual 0
failure 0
suggests 0
to 0
Obama 0
that’s 0
there 0
is 0
more 0
economic 0
upside 0
for 0
blacks 0
in 0
shaking 1
down 1
white 1
institutions 1
than 0
in 0
building 0
their 0
own. 0

During 0
the 0
2008 0
presidential 0
election, 0
conservatives 0
questioned 0
the 0
indirect 0
ties 0
between 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
Obama, 0
who 0
attended 0
a 0
church 0
that 0
gave 0
Farrakhan 0
an 0
award. 0

Obama’s 0
“spiritual 1
advisor” 1
Rev. 0

Jeremiah 0
Wright 0
gave 0
Farrakhan 0
his 0
church’s 0
Lifetime 0
Achievement 0
award 0
in 0
a 0
downtown 0
Chicago 0
Hyatt 0
Regency 0
in 0
November 0
2007, 0
but 0
the 0
story 0
didn’t 0
make 0
the 0
press 0
until 0
the 0
following 0
year. 0

Similarly, 0
very 0
little 0
media 0
attention 0
was 0
paid 0
to 0
the 0
close 0
relationship 0
between 0
Obama’s 0
fundraiser 0
and 0
private 0
mentor 0
Tony 0
Rezko 0
and 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam, 0
even 0
though 0
Rezko’s 0
role 0
was 0
business 0
manager 0
for 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
assets, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
career 0
of 0
Muhammad 0
Ali. 0

But 0
after 0
all, 0
what 0
could 0
be 0
more 0
boring 0
than 0
a 0
story 0
than 0
involves 0
a 0
Presidential 0
candidate, 0
the 0
Syrian 0
Christian 0
crook 0
who 0
helped 0
him 0
buy 0
his 0
house, 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam, 0
and 0
the 0
most 0
famous 0
boxer 0
of 0
all 0
time? 0

Reading 1
Obama’s 1
1995 1
memoir, 1
you 1
might 1
almost 1
get 1
the 1
impression 1
that 1
after 1
a 1
prudent 1
first 1
term, 1
during 1
his 1
second 1
he 1
might 1
side 1
with, 1
I 1
dunno, 1
Black 1
Lives 1
Matter 1
and 1
encourage 1
a 1
wave 1
of 1
black 1
rage 1
and 1
police 1
retreat 1
that 1
drove 1
up 1
the 1
death 1
toll 1
from 1
murder 1
by 1
20% 1
in 1
his 1
last 1
two 1
years 1
in 1
office, 1
an 1
incremental 1
death 1
toll 1
a 1
little 1
bigger 1
than 1
the 1
U.S. 1
combat 1
death 1
toll 1
from 1
the 1
equally 1
stupid 1

still 1
misunderstanding 1

A 0

But 0
an 0

by 0

that 0

beyond 0

to 0
give 0

the 0
altered 0

to 0

improper 0
absentee 0

after 0

include 0
an 0

We 0
also 0

that 0
a 0

signed 0

engaging 0

ignored 1

mixed 1
invalid 1
provisional 1
ballots 1

don't 1

that 1
doing 1

nothing 1

Now 1
that 1

perhaps 1
it's 1
time 1
to 1
quit 1

a 0

assigned 0
to 0
the 0

not 0

of 0
any 0

inside 0

Jinnie 0
Lee, 0
a 0

for 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Embassy 0
in 0
Beijing, 0
said 0
that 0
from 0
late 0
2017 0
to 0
April 0
2018, 0
a 0
government 0
employee 0
assigned 0
to 0
Guangzhou 0
reported 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
physical 0
symptoms. 0

The 0
employee 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
United 0

for 0
evaluation 0
and 0
treatment. 0

On 0
May 0
18, 0
the 0
embassy 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
diagnosis 0
was 0
mild 0
traumatic 0
brain 0
injury. 0

"The 0
medical 0
indications 0
are 0
very 0
similar, 0
and 0
entirely 0
consistent 0
with, 0
the 0
medical 0
indications 0
that 0
were 0
taking 0
place 0
to 0
Americans 0
working 0
in 0
Cuba," 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0

Wednesday 0
during 0

in 0
Congress. 0

"The 0

assured 0
us 0
they 0
are 0
also 0
investigating 0

taking 0
appropriate 0

Lee 0

The 0

advised 0

U.S. 0

should 0
consult 0
a 0
medical 0
professional 0
if 0
they 0
experience 0

"While 0

acute 0
auditory 0

“We 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
nexus 0
of 0
terrorism 0
at 0
this 0
point,” 0
Ragan 0
said. 0

That 0
means 0
they 0
didn’t 0
find 0
an 0
ISIS 0
membership 0
card 0
in 0
his 0
wallet, 0
or 0
lots 0
of 0

a 0

from 0
Kazi 0
reading, 0
“I 0
did 0
this 0
for 0
Allah 0
and 0
Islam. 0

Allahu 1
akbar.” 1

Of 1
course, 1
even 1
if 1
they 1
had 1
found 1
those 1
things, 1
given 1
their 1
track 1
record 1
of 1
denial 1
and 1
deception, 1
they 1
may 1
still 1
be 1
searching 1
for 1
Kazi’s 1
motive. 1

In 1
any 1
case, 1
a 1
larger 1
point 1
is 1
being 1
lost 1
here. 1

And 1
that 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
war 1
going 1
on. 1

We 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
Islamic 1
State, 1
al-Qaeda 1
and 1
other 1
groups 1
have 1
called 1
upon 1
Muslims 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
kill 1
military 1
personnel 1
and 1
police, 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
civilians. 1

We 0
know 0
that 0
Kazi, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
propane 0
and 0
gas 0
tanks 0
in 0
his 0
car, 0
was 0
clearly 0
trying 0
to 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
major 0
fire 0
that 0
would 0
kill 0
more 0
people 0
than 0
just 0
himself. 0

Even 0
if 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
to 0
Baghdadi, 0
the 0
likelihood 0
is 0
that 0
when 0
a 0
Muslim 0
drives 0
into 0
a 0
U.S. 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base 0
with 0
a 0
car 0
full 0
of 0
incendiaries, 0
probably 0
this 0
has 0
something 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
global 0
jihad. 0

The 0
FBI’s 0
bafflement 0
here 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
deep, 0
deep 0
corruption. 0

The 0
FBI 0
doesn’t 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
global 0
jihad, 0
or 0
that 0
Islam 0
has 0
anything 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
terrorism. 0

It 0
doesn’t 0
admit 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
war 0
going 0
on, 0
and 0
treats 0
each 0
act 0
of 0
Islamic 0
terror 0
as 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
a 0
separate 0
and 0
discrete 0
criminal 0
event, 0
unrelated 0
to 0
all 0
the 0
others. 0

So, 0
each 0
time 0
something 0
like 0
this 0
happens, 0
they’re 0
back 0
at 0
Square 0
One, 0
trying 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
motive. 0

It’s 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Army 0
stopped 0
to 0
interrogate 0
every 0
German 0
soldier 0
who 0
crashed 0
through 0
the 0
Ardennes 0
Forest 0
at 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Battle 0
of 0
the 0
Bulge 0
in 0
1944, 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
each 0
one’s 0
actions 0
had 0
anything 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
German 1
Army 1
and 1
Adolf 1
Hitler’s 1
war 0
aims. 0

This 0
willful 0
ignorance 0
leads 0
to 0
a 0
diversion 0
and 0
waste 0
of 0

that 0
is 0

Lawrence-Hardy 0
told 0

The 0
Coming 0
Coup 0

The 0
annual 0
budget 0
of 0
the 0

This 1

sum 1
is 0
drawn 0
from 0
US 0

To 0
justify 0
such 1
an 1
enormous 1

a 0

required. 0

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
and 0
the 0

politicians 0
that 0
the 0

its 0
coup 0
against 0

the 0

In 1
1961 1
President 1
Dwight 1

warned 1
Americans 1
in 1
his 1
last 1
public 1
address 1
that 1
the 1
military/industrial 1
complex 1
was 1
a 1
threat 1
to 1

democracy. 1

Truer 0
words 0
were 0
never 0
spoken 0
by 0
an 0
American 0
president. 0

Shortly 0
thereafter, 0
the 0

assassinated 0
President 0
John 0
F. 0
Kennedy 0
for 0
working 0
toward 0
peace 0
with 0
Soviet 0
leader 0
Khrushchev. 0

get 0
rid 0

who 0

control 0
agreements 0

the 0
“Watergate 0

that 0
the 0

used 0

If 0

will 0
be 0

I’m 1
not 1
sure 1
we’re 1
doing 1
just 1
fine, 1
but 0
Trump 0
is 0
right 0
that 0
the 0
real 0
problem 0
is 0
jihad 0
terror 0
and 0
Sharia 0
supremacism, 0
and 0
British 1
authorities 1
want 1
to 1
ignore 1
that 1
and 1
shoot 1
the 1
messenger. 1

And 0
so 0
Chris 0
Bryant, 0
“a 0
senior 0
Labour 0
backbencher, 0
has 0
written 0
to 0
May 0
urging 0
her 0
to 0

he 1

‘not 1

a 0
senior 0
Labour 0

For 0
Chris 0
Bryant, 0
apparently 0
“fascism” 0
means 0
“defense 1
of 1
Britain 1
and 1
its 1
values 1
against 0
jihad 0

Bryant 0
“cited 0

Why 0
are 0
we 0
“far 0
right”? 0

Everything 0
we 0
do 0
is 0
in 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
freedom 0
of 0
speech 0
and 0
equality 0
of 0

of 0
all 0
people 0
before 0
the 0

That’s 0
“far 0
right”? 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
note 0
well: 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
me 0
from 0
the 0
UK 0

That’s 0
a 0
demonstrably 0
true 0
statement. 0

Meanwhile, 0
Britain 0
has 0
a 0
steadily 0
lengthening 0
record 0
of 0
admitting 0
jihad 0

without 0
a 0

Syed 0
Muzaffar 0
Shah 0
Qadri’s 0

"Any 1
Jew 1
who 1
opposes 1
the 1

— 1
or 1
opposes 1

itself 1
— 1
knows 1
that 1
feeling 1
of 1
being 1
shunned 1
from 1
the 1
places 1
that 1
are 1
supposed 1
to 1
shelter 1
and 1
nurture 1
you: 1
families, 1
synagogues, 1

organizations," 1
Fishback 0
continues. 0

"I 0
am 0
terrified 1
for 0
the 0
Jewish 0
people. 0

I 0
was 0
raised 0
to 0
believe 0
we 0
were 0
a 0
people 0
of 0
dissent 0
and 0
argument. 0

I 0
was 0
taught 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
important 0
to 0
ask 0
difficult 0
questions, 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
noble 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
for 0
what 0
you 0
believed 0
in. 0

If 1
our 1
Jewish 1
institutions 1
— 1
particularly 1
the 1
American 1
Jewish 1
Historical 1
Society 1
— 1
cannot 1
accommodate 1
dissent, 1
and 1
effectively 1
exclude 1
all 1
Jewish 1
anti-Zionists, 1
then 1
they 1
have 1
not 1
only 1
lost 1
a 1
rapidly 1
growing 1
Jewish 1
population, 1
but 1
they 1
have 1
lost 1
a 1
key 1
aspect 1
of 1
their 1
Jewishness." 1

Let's 0
unpack 0
this 0
knapsack 1
of 1
entitled 1
nonsense. 1

Anti-Israel 0
activists 0
like 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
are 0
entitled 0
to 0
exploit 0
Jewish 0
spaces 0
for 0
their 0
propoaganda... 0
even 0
while 0
they 0
advocate 0
a 0
boycott 0
of 0
the 0
Jews 0
of 0
Israel. 0

Previously 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
had 0
authored 0
an 0
article 0
arguing 0
for 0
boycotting 0
some 0
Israeli 0
plays. 0

Now 0
he's 0
whining 1
that 0
boycotting 0
his 0
play 0
is 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
Jewishness 0
because 0
Jews 0
are 0
a 0
"people 0
of 0
dissent 0
and 0
argument." 0

But 0
the 0
only 0
dissent 0
and 0
argument 0
that 0
Jews 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0
welcome 0
is 0
that 0
of 0
people 1
who 1
hate 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
Jewish 1
nationhood. 1

Not 1
of 1
Jewish 1
nationhood 1
itself. 1

"it’s 0
not 0
that 0
BDS 0
is 0
“censoring” 0
work 0
— 0
it’s 0
that 0
BDS 0
is 0
resisting 0
a 0
propaganda 0
campaign 0
that 0
was 0
intentionally 0
crafted 0
to 0
influence 0
international 0
politics," 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
claimed 0
when 0
advocating 0
a 0
boycott 0
of 0
some 0
Israeli 0
plays. 0

It's 0
not 0
that 0
boycotting 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
censors 0
work. 0

It's 1
resistance 1
to 1
a 1
propaganda 1
campaign 1
intended 1
to 1
attack 1
the 1
human 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
Jewish 1
people. 1

It's 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
#BDStears 0
crowd 0
to 0
examine 0
their 0
entitlement 0
and 0
recognize 0
that 0
what's 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
goose 0
is 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
gander. 0

Either 1
that 1
or 1
they 1
can 1
go 1
whine 1
to 1
the 1
New 1

Times 1
some 1
more 1
because 1
the 1
Jewish 1
community 1
won't 1

of 0
persecution, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
evidence 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
face 0
persecution 0
today. 0

She 0
and 0
other 0
kritarchs 0
have 0
acted 0
outside 0
the 0
law, 0
something 0
that 0
the 0
reporter 0
surprisingly 0
puts 0
in 0
the 0
story.And 0
the 0
Treason 0
Bar 0
attorney 0
demanded 0
that 0
Kritarch 0
Saris 0
create 0
a 0
whole 0
new 0
second 0
immigration 0
appeals 0
system 0
of 0
unlimited 0
delay 0
for 0
these 0
illegal 1
aliens.Kritarch 0
Saris 0
thinks 0
that 0
her 0
feelings 0
about 0
a 0
deportation 0
are 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
the 0
law.Well, 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
Kritarch 0
Saris' 0
concern. 0

The 0
concern 0
over 0
persecution 0
overseas 0
is 0
reviewed 0
by 0
the 0
Executive 0
Branch, 0
and 0
that 0

was 0
entered--there 0
is 0
no 0
"bad 0
situation" 0
for 0
her 0
to 0
be 0
concerned 0
about. 0

And 0
Saris 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
kritarch 0
that 0
thinks 0
they 0
run 0
immigration 0
policy--Mark 0

Tuesday: 0

a 0

between 0
President 0

and 0
Secretary 0
of 0

Rex 0
Tillerson, 0
the 0

Trump 0
announced 0

ouster 0
via 0
Twitter 0
Tuesday, 0
saying: 0
“Mike 0

Director 0
of 0

will 0
become 0

This 0
is 0
yet 0
another 0
big 0
shake-up 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
still-young 0
administration 0
— 0
and 0
it 0
may 0
be 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
one 0
to 0
date. 0

The 0
move 0
creates 0
some 0
big 0
questions 0
about 0
both 0
the 0

foreign 0
policy 0
ambitions 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0

“I 0
will 0
oppose 0
both 0
Pompeo’s 0
nomination 0
and 0
Haspel’s 0
nomination,” 0
Paul 0
said 0
Wednesday. 0

The 0
Kentucky 0
lawmaker 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
Republican 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
will 0
attempt 0
to 0
block 0
the 0
nominees; 0
but 0
he 0
isn’t 0
the 0
first 0
Republican 0
to 0
express 0
concern. 0

Sen. 0
John 0
McCain 0
of 0
Arizona 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
wanted 0
answers 0
about 0
Haspel’s 0
background 0
running 0
CIA 0
torture 0
programs 0
prior 0
to 0
her 0
confirmation. 0

Paul 0
contends 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
nominations 0
directly 0
contradict 0
promises 0
the 0
president 0
made 0
on 0
the 0
campaign 0
trail. 0

“I’m 0
perplexed 1
by 1
the 0
nomination 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
love 1
the 1
Iraq 1
War 1
so 0
much 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
advocate 0
for 0
a 0
war 0
with 0
Iran 0
next. 0

I 0
think 0
it 0
goes 0
against 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
President 0
Trump 0
campaigned 0
on,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
lawmaker 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
can’t 0
support 0
Haspel, 0
whom 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
having 0
expressed 0
“joyful 1
glee” 1
at 0
being 0
involved 0
in 0
torture 0
programs 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

“I 0
find 1
it 1
just 1
amazing 1
that 1
anyone 1
would 1
consider 1
having 1
this 1
woman 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
CIA,” 1
Paul 0
said. 0

With 0
Paul’s 0
defection 0
and 0
McCain 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
undergoing 0
treatment 0
for 0
brain 0
cancer 0
at 0

The 0
story 0
concerns 0
Ashley 0
Arnold, 0
a 0
27-year-old 0
working 0
on 0
an 0
online 0
sociology 0
degree. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
her 0
final 0
class, 0
for 0
which 0
she 0
paid 0
almost 0
$1,000, 0
students 0
were 0
required 0
to 0
complete 0
a 0
project 0
outline 0
last 0
month 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
would 0
compare 0
a 0
social 0
norm 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
another 0
country. 0

For 0
her 0
"norm" 0
Arnold 0
picked 0
social 0
media 0
use, 0
and 0
for 0
her 0
country 0
she 0
chose 0
Australia. 0

But 0
when 0
Arnold 0
got 0
her 0
grade 0
back 0
on 0
Feb. 0
1, 0
she 0
was 0
shocked 1
to 0
see 0
her 0
professor 0
had 0
failed 0
her. 0

Why? 0

Because, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
teacher, 0
"Australia 0
is 0
a 0
continent; 0
not 0
a 0
country." 0

Sociology. 1

You 1
really 1
don't 1
need 1
to 1
know 1
anything. 1

The 1
professor, 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
PhD 1
in 1
philosophy... 1

Of 1
course 1
she 1
does. 1

I 0
believe 0
I 0
got 0
zero 0
or 0
partial 0
credit 0
because 0
the 0
instructor 0
said, 0
'Australia 0
is 0
a 0
continent; 0
not 0
a 0
country. 0

However, 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
a 0
country. 0

The 0
research 0
starter 0
on 0
the 0
SNHU’s 0
Shapiro 0
library 0
written 0
by 0
John 0
Pearson 0
(2013) 0
states, 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
the 0
'sixth-largest 0
country 0
in 0
the 0
world' 0
(n.p.). 0

The 0
full 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
country 0
is 0
the 0
Commonwealth 0
of 0
Australia, 0
meaning 0
Australia 0
is 0
both 0
a 0
continent 0
and 0
a 0
country. 0

Therefore, 0
these 0
sections 0
of 0
the 0
rubric 0
should 0
be 0
amended. 0

Australia's 0
nationhood 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
belief. 0

But 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
the 1
age 1
of, 1
"My 1
truth". 1

And 0
my 1
truth 1
has 0
a 0
different 0
belief 0
about 0
Australia 0
than 0
yours 0
does 0
because 0
of 0
my 0
degree 0
of 0
oppression. 0

Finally, 0

the 0
professor 0
responded: 0
Thank 0
you 0
for 0
this 0
web-address 0

After 0

I 0
do 0
some 0
independent 0
research 0
on 0
the 0
continent/country 0
issue 0
I 0
will 0
review 0

First 1

Jews. 1

And 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
for 1
everyone 1
else. 1

The 0
latest 0
incident 0
at 0
the 0
Canadian 0

agenda. 1

A 0
Jewish 0
student 0
at 0
McGill 0
University 0
has 0
been 0
kicked 1
off 1
the 0
student 0
government 0
board 0
for 0
having 0
“conflicts 0
of 0
interest” 0
due 0
to 0
his 0
pro-Israel 0
activism. 0

Third-year 0
student 0
Noah 0
Lew 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
12 0
board 0
members 0
up 0
for 0
general 0
assembly 0
ratification 0
on 0
Monday 0
evening 0
following 0
his 0
victory 0
as 0
vice-president 0
finance 0
of 0
the 0
Arts 0
Undergraduate 0
Society. 0

The 0
ratification 0
vote 0
is 0
typically 0
a 0
mere 0
formality, 0
but 0
Monday’s 0
was 0
different 0
due 0
to 0
Democratize 0
Student 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
(SSMU), 0
an 0
organization 0
that 0
was 0
established 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
university’s 0
ban 0
of 0
the 0
Boycott, 0
Divestment 0
and 0
Sanctions 0
(BDS) 0
movement 0
on 0
campus. 0

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
pass 0
a 0
motion 0
that 0
required 0
each 0
board 0
member 0
to 0
be 0
voted 0
upon 0
separately 0
under 0
the 0
grounds 0
that 0
they 0
weren’t 0
a 0
fan 0
of 0
the 0
names. 0

When 0
it 0
was 0
Lew’s 0
turn, 0
he 0
was 0
voted 0
down, 0
105 0
to 0
73 0
with 0
12 0
abstaining, 0
with 0
applause 0
following 0
the 0
vote. 0

Two 0
other 0
students 0
who 0
had 0
criticized 0
BDS, 0
Alexander 0
Scheffel 0
and 0
Josephine 0
Wright 0
O’Manique, 0
were 0
also 0
voted 0
down. 0

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
had 0
targeted 0
Lew 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
two 0
students 0
on 0
the 0
board 0
because 0
they 0
had 0
connections 0
to 0
the 0
Canadian 0
Jewish 0
Political 0
Affairs 0
Committee 0
(CJPAC) 0
and 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
getting 0
the 0
BDS 0
ban 0
passed, 0
which 0
Democratize 0
SSMU 0
claimed 0
were 0
“conflicts 0
of 0
interests.” 0

Somehow 0
I 0
don't 0
think 0
being 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
Muslim 0
student 0
group 0
and 0
supporting 0
BDS 0
would 0
be 0
considered 0
a 0
conflict 0
of 0
interest. 0

But 0
the 1
campus 1
anti-Israel 1
crowd 1
has 0
been 0
working 0
rather 0
hard 0
to 0
intimidate 0
and 0
penalize 0
anyone 0
involved 0
in 0
pro-Israel 0
organizations. 0

And 0
to 0
keep 0
their 0
racist 1
boycott 1
movement 1
going 0
by 0
maintaining 0
control 0
over 0
student 0
governments. 0

Lew 0
shared 0
the 0
experience 0
on 0
Facebook. 0

“I 0
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
from 1
the 1
information 1
circulated 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
campaign 1
run 1
against 1
me 1
prior 1
to 1
this 1
vote 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
about 1
my 1
Jewish 1
identity, 1
and 1
nothing 1
more,” 1
wrote 0
Lew. 0

“I 0
was 0
blocked 0
from 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
my 0
student 0
government 0
because 0
I 0
am 0
Jewish, 0
because 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
affiliated 0
with 0
Jewish 0
organizations, 0
and 0
because 0
I 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
Jewish 0
self-determination.” 0
Lew 0
added 0
that 0
the 0
experience 0
shows 0
the 0
inherent 0
anti-Semitism 0
in 0
the 0
BDS 0
movement. 0

“If 0
BDS 0
is 0
not 0
anti-Semitic, 0
why 1
did 1
a 1
BDS-led 1
campaign 1
name 1
and 1
shame 1
me 1
for 1
my 1
affiliation 1
with 1
a 1
Jewish 1
organization, 1
and 1
call 1
on 1

to 1
remove 1
me 1
from 1

for 1
this 1
reason?” 1

why 1
was 1
I 1
barred 1
from 1
participating 1
in 1
student 1
government 1
because 1
of 1
my 1
Jewish 1
identity?” 1

There 0
are 0
some 0
more 0
details 0
here 0
and 0
a 0
petition. 0

On 0
Monday 0
night, 0
three 0
students 0
were 0
removed 0
from 0
the 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
of 0
the 0
Students’ 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
(SSMU), 0
McGill’s 0
main 0
student 0
government. 0

All 0
three 0
were 0
targeted 0
for 0
removal 0
either 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
Jewish 0
or 0
have 0
vocally 0
opposed 0
anti-Jewish 0
discrimination 0
on 0
campus. 0

This 0
episode 0
is 0
utterly 1
unacceptable, 1
and 0
is 0
merely 0
the 0
latest 0
in 0
a 0
long 0
string 0
of 0
antisemitic 0
incidents 0
at 0
your 0
university. 0

Indeed, 0
according 0
to 0
eyewitnesses, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
mob 0
that 0
removed 0
the 0
three 0
directors 0
was 0
Igor 0
Sadikov. 0

You 0
will 0
remember 0
Sadikov 0
as 0
the 0
student 0
politician 0
who 0
in 0
February 0
told 0
his 0
followers 0
to 0
“punch 1
a 1
Zionist 1
today.” 1
It 0
is 0
unclear 0
whether 0
Sadikov 0
has 0
faced 0
any 0
disciplinary 0
action 0
for 0
this 0
incitement 0
to 0
violence 0
from 0
your 0
administration. 0

Antisemitism 0
at 0
McGill 0
does 0
not 0
emerge 0
from 0
a 0
vacuum. 0

Rather, 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
nurtured 0
in 0
part 0
by 0
a 1
toxic 1
campus 1
press, 1
especially 0
the 0
McGill 0
Daily, 0
a 0
publication 0
which 0
openly 0
refuses 0
to 0
publish 0
any 0
“Zionist” 0
content. 0

In 0
practice, 0
this 0
prevents 0
McGill’s 0
Jewish 0
community 0
from 0
defending 0
itself 0
against 0
the 1
absurd 1
attacks 1
to 0
which 0
it 0
is 0
subjected. 0

If 0
the 0
Daily 0
is 0
committed 0
to 0
systematically 0
excluding 0
the 0
voices 0
of 0
an 0
ethno-religious 0
community 0
on 0
campus, 0
then 0
it 0
cannot 0
continue 0
to 0
receive 0
automatic 0
student 0
funding, 0
as 0
it 0
does 0
now. 0

The 0
double 0
standard 0
here 0
is 0
pretty 0
clear. 0

And 0
we 0
know 1
exactly 1
what 1
the 1
reaction 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
a 1
student 1
paper 1
refused 1
to 1
publish 1
any 1
pro-Islamist 1
content. 1

a 1

doozy. 1

about 0

It’s 0
all 0
about 0
Glazov’s 0
new 0

“Jihadist 1
Psychopath: 1
How 0
He 0
Is 0
Charming, 1

At 0
FrontPage 0
Magazine, 0
where 0
he 0
is 0
editor, 0
he 0
had 0
posted 0
“9 0

as 0
“Label 0

assessment” 0
and 0
“Stop 0
‘partnering’ 0
with 0
Muslim 0

That 0
apparently 0
was 0
too 0
much 0
for 0
Facebook, 0
which 0
declared 0
“only 0
you 0

because 0
it 0
“goes 0

of 0
the 0
Islamic 1
jihadist 1
attack 1
on 0
America 0
that 0
killed 0
nearly 0
3,000. 0

Glazov 0
told 0
Breitbart, 0
“This 0
is 0
really 0
getting 1
surreal 1
in 1
the 1
creepiest 1
and 1
most 1
harrowing 1

Facebook’s 0
Unholy 1
Alliance 1

are, 0
without 0
doubt, 0
accelerating 0
their 0
totalitarian 1
suffocation 1
of 1
free 1
thought 1
and 1
expression. 1

It 0
is 0
no 0
surprise, 0
therefore, 0
that 0
Frontpage’s 0
editor, 0
and 0
host 0
of 0
‘The 0

was 0
suspended 0
from 0

30 0

yesterday, 0

after 0
posting 0
his 0
article, 0
‘9 0
Steps 0

Glazov 0
believed 0
that 0
the 0
article 0
was 0
more 0
relevant 0
and 0
urgent 0
than 0
ever 0
due 0
to 0
the 1
skyrocketing 1
jihadist 1
stabbings 1
in 1
Europe 1
— 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
17th 0
anniversary 0
of 0
9/11 0
that 0
was 0
approaching 0
the 0
next 0
day. 0

The 0
report 0
said 0
it 0
appears 0
“that 1
daring 1
to 1
give 1
suggestions 1
on 1
how 1
our 1
civilization 1
can 1
stop 1

and 1
another 1
9/11 1
is 1
against 1
Facebook’s 1
‘community 1

'” 0

“Glazov’s 0
advice 0
also 0
involves 0
the 0
promotion 0
of 0
supporting 0
moderate 1
Muslims 1
– 0
a 1
move 1
that 1
is, 1
clearly, 1
horrifying 1
to 1
Facebook’s 1
masters 1
and 1
therefore 1
also 1
violates 1
their 1
‘community 1
standards,'” 1
the 0
report 0
said. 0

No 0
doubt, 0
Glazov’s 0
consistent 0
campaigning 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Muslim 0
women 0
and 0
girls 0
in 0
his 0
efforts 0
to 0
protect 0
them 0
from 0
FGM, 0
honor 1
killings 1
and 1
other 1
Shariah 1
barbarities, 1
has 0
gained 0
him 0
the 1
anger 1
and 1
hatred 1
of 0
Facebook’s 1
guardians 1
— 0
who 1
are 1
clearly 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
Shariah 1
enforcers 1
and 1
oppressors 1
of 1
Muslim 1
women 1
and 1
girls. 1

The 0
report 0
recalls 0
that 0
Facebook 0
censored 0
Glazov 0
in 0
April 0
for 0
posting 0
screenshots 0
of 0
a 0
Muslim’s 0
threat 0
to 0
him. 0

Twitter 0
also 0
lashed 1
out 1
at 0
him 0
for 0
quoting 0
directly 0
from 0
Islamic 0
religious 0
texts, 0
citing 0
its 0
anti-“hate” 1
policies. 1

It 0
is 0
‘hateful 1
conduct,’ 1
apparently, 0
to 0
reference 0
what 0
Islamic 0
texts 0
themselves 0
say. 0

Indeed, 0
Frontpage’s 0
editor 0
had 0
simply 0
referred 0
to 0
Sahih 0
Bukhari’s 0
texts 0
discussing 0
Mohammed’s 0
marriage 0
to 0
Aisha 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
six 0
years 0
old 0
(7.62.88) 0
and 0
to 0
Quranic 0
Suras 0
that 0
mandate 0
the 0
Hijab 0
for 0
women 0
(24:31; 0
33:59) 0
and 0
sanction 0
sexual 0
slavery 0
(4:3; 0
33:50). 0

Facebook 0
also 0
refused 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
Glazov’s 0
inquiry 0
about 0
“what 0
it 0
is 0
specifically 0
that 0
violates 0
Facebook’s 0
‘community 0

when 0
a 0
person 0
gives 0
advice 0
on 0
how 1
to 1

defend 1

lives 1
from 1

Glazov 0
has 0
written 0
about 0
the 0
subject 0
in 0
previous 0
books, 0
including 0
“High 0
Noon 0
for 0
America: 0
The 0
Coming 0
Showdown” 0
and 0
“United 0
in 0
Hate.” 0

In 0
his 0
“9 0
Steps” 0
article, 0
he 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
was 0
“cooperating 0
with, 0
and 0
listening 0
to, 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
front 0
groups 0
such 0
as 0
CAIR 0
and 0
ISNA.” 0

The 1
government 1
needs, 1
he 1
said, 1
to 1
“implement 1
a 1
concrete 1
‘countering-jihad’ 1
strategy.” 1

And 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
needs 1
to 1
affirm 1
“Shariah’s 1
assault 1
on 1
the 1
U.S. 1
Constitution 1
as 1
seditious.” 1

A 0
last 0
key 0
point, 0
the 0
said, 0
is 0
to 0
ridicule 0
the 0
enemy. 0

Ridicule 0
is 0
a 0
vicious 1
and 1
potent 1
weapon. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
baffling 1
and 1
shameful 1
silence 0
in 0
our 0
culture’s 0
sphere 0
of 0
comedy, 0
especially 0
in 0
Hollywood 0
and 0
our 0

with 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0

ingredients 0
of 0

– 0
and 0
to 0
also 0
vigorously 1

in 0

when 0

an 0

two 0

“I 0
apologized 0
to 0
everybody 0
in 0
the 0
world,” 0
Clinton 0
said 0
of 0
his 0
public 0
apology. 0

Melvin 0
followed 0
up 0
by 0
asking 0
Clinton 0
if 0
he 0
had 0
ever 0
apologized 0
privately. 0

“I 0
have 0
never 0
talked 0
to 0
her. 0

But 0
I 0
did 0
say 0
publicly 0
on 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
occasion 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
sorry. 0

That’s 0
very 0
different. 0

The 0
apology 0
was 0
public,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Will 0

Continue 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
JFK 0
Cover-Up? 0

Last 0
Friday, 0
President 0

made 0
the 0
following 0
announcement: 0

I 0
have 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0

of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
remaining 0
JFK-assassination 0

records 0
except 0
for 0
those 0
records 0
that 0
directly 0
implicate 0
the 0
CIA 0
in 0
the 0
assassination, 0
which 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
remain 0
secret.” 0

Okay, 0
he 0
didn’t 0
really 0
put 0
it 0
like 0
that. 0

But 0
that’s 0
the 0
potential 0
and 0
likely 0
import 0
of 0
his 0
announcement, 0
which 0
actually 0
read 0
as 0
follows: 0

Subject 0
to 0
the 0
receipt 0
of 0
further 0
information, 0
I 0
will 0
be 0
allowing, 0
as 0
President, 0
the 0
long 0
blocked 0
and 0
classified 0

FILES 0
to 0

(Italics 0

operative 0
words, 0
of 0
course, 0
are: 0
“Subject 0

Negotiations. 0

The 0
art 0
of 0
the 0
deal. 0

The 0
CIA 0
desperately 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
its 0
long-secret 0
JFK-related 0
records. 0

It 0
has 0
asked 0
Trump 0
to 0
continue 0
keeping 0
at 0
least 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
secret 0
notwithstanding 0
the 0
passage 0
of 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years 0
since 0
the 0
Kennedy 0
assassination. 0

Under 0
long-established 0
custom 0
and 0
tradition 0
in 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
when 0
someone 0
asks 0
someone 0
else 0
for 0
a 0
favor, 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
is 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
grant 0
the 0
favor 0
demands 0
something 0
in 0
return. 0

That’s 0
where 0
the 0
negotiations 0
between 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
come 0
into 0
play. 0

Trump 0
wants 0
something 0
in 0
return. 0

We 0
don’t 0
know 0
what 0
— 0
maybe 0
laying 0
off 0
on 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
— 0
but 0
his 0
announcement 0
last 0
Friday 0
is 0
obviously 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
concluding 0
steps 0
of 0
such 0
negotiations. 0

Time 0
to 0
buy 0
old 0
US 0
gold 0
coins 0

What 0
Trump 0
has 0
done 0
with 0
his 0
announcement 0
is 0
send 0
a 0
clear 0
message 0
to 0
the 0
CIA: 0
“Give 0
me 0
what 0
I 0
want 0
and 0
I’ll 0
give 0
you 0
want 0
you 0
want. 0

Otherwise, 0
I 0
will 0
let 0
all 0
your 0
cherished 1
long-secret 1
records 1
relating 0
to 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
be 0
shown 0
to 0
the 0
American 0
people.” 0

Make 0
no 0
mistake 0
about 0
it: 0
A 0
deal 0
is 0
about 0
to 0
be 0
made. 0

The 0
CIA 0
will 0
cave. 0

It 0
will 0
end 0
up 0
giving 0
Trump 0
whatever 0
it 0
is 0
he 0
wants. 0

Trump 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
driver’s 1
seat 1
because 1
the 1
CIA 1
cannot 1
afford 1
to 1
permit 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
records 1
it 1
wants 1
to 1
continue 1
to 1
be 1
kept 1
secret. 1

And 0
once 1
the 1
CIA 1
gives 1
Trump 1
what 1
he 1
wants, 1
he 1
will 1
cave 1
and 1
give 1
the 1
CIA 1
the 1
continued 1
secrecy 1
it 1
so 1
desperately 1
needs. 1

All 0
this 0
will 0
happen 0
by 0
this 0
Thursday, 0
the 0
date 0
set 0
by 0
law 0
for 0
release 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
JFK 0
records 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
not 0
blocked. 0

Think 0
about 0
it: 0
The 0
CIA 0
has 0
asked 0
the 0
president 0
to 0
continue 0
secrecy 0
of 0
records 0
that 0
are 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years 0
old 0
or, 0
apparently, 0
some 0
relating 0
to 0
secret 0
correspondence 0
between 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
1990s. 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
ground? 0

“National 0
security” 0
of 0
course, 0
the 1
two 1
most 1
important 1
and 1
meaningless 1
words 1
in 0
the 0
American 0
political 0
lexicon. 0

National 0
security? 0

Really? 0

Whatever 0
definition 0
that 0
one 0
might 0
put 0
on 0
that 0
nebulous 0
term, 0
no 1
reasonable 1
person 1
can 1
honestly 1
believe 1
that 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
50-year-old 0
records 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
result 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
falling 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
or 0
even 0
that 0
the 1
communists 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
take 1
over 1
the 1
federal 1
government. 1

The 0
CIA 0
says 0
that 0
releasing 0
its 0
decades-old 0
JFK 0
records 0
will 0
reveal 0
secret 0
“methods” 0
of 0
intelligence 0
gathering. 0

Really? 1

What, 1
like 1
the 1
CIA 1
was 1
using 1
typewriters 1
instead 1
of 1
computers 1
and 1
pay 1
telephones 1
instead 1
of 1
cell 1
phones? 1

What 0
is 0
amazing 0
(or 0
not) 0
is 0
the 1
extreme 1
nonchalance 1
of 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
to 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
continued 0
secrecy. 0

That 0
should 0
be 0
big 0
news. 0

It’s 1
essentially 1
an 1
admission 1
of 1
guilt, 1
given 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
absolutely 1
ludicrous 1
to 0
think 0
that 0
“national 0
security” 0
would 0
be 0
threatened 0
by 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
long-secret 0
JFK-assassination-related 0
records. 0

You 0
see, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
starts 0
with 0
the 0
assumption 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
assassination. 0

In 0
their 0
minds, 0
the 0
assassination 0
was 0
committed 0
by 0
a 0
lone 1
nut 1
former 1
U.S. 1
Marine 1
communist, 1
one 0
who 0
had 0
no 0
motive 0
to 0
kill 0
the 0
president. 0

Such 0
being 0
the 0
case, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
deferring 0
to 0
the 0
CIA, 0
automatically 0
concludes 0
that 0
its 0
wish 0
to 0
continue 0
keeping 0
secret 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
“national 0
security” 0
grounds 0
rather 0
than 0
an 0
attempt 0
by 0
the 0
CIA 0
to 0
continue 0
its 0
cover-up 0
of 0
its 0
assassination 0
of 0
the 0
president. 0

Let’s 0
proceed 0
from 0
the 0
opposite 0
assumption: 0
That 0
the 0
CIA, 0
in 0
partnership 0
with 0
the 0
military 0
and 0
the 0
Mafia, 0
orchestrated 0
the 0
assassination 0
by 0
framing 0
a 0
former 0
U.S. 0
Marine 0
who 0
was 0
then 0
working 0
for 0
U.S. 0
intelligence, 0
either 0
Navy 0
intelligence, 0
the 0
CIA, 0
or 0
the 0
FBI, 0
or 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
all 0
three. 0

Don’t 0
forget, 0
after 0
all, 0
that 0
that’s 0
what 0
Oswald 0
said. 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
framed. 0

Yet, 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
beginning, 0
the 1
mainstream 1
media 1
has 1
never 1
given 1
any 1
serious 1
consideration 1
to 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
framed 0
for 0
the 0
crime. 0

Instead, 0
they 0
have 0
steadfastly 0
stuck 0
with 0
the 0
official 0
story, 0
one 0
that 0
has 0
all 0
the 0
characteristics 0
of 0
a 0
pat 1
frame-up: 1
That 0
Oswald 0
acted 0
alone 0
or 0
possibly 0
acted 0
in 0
concert 0
with 0
others, 0
both 0
of 0
which 0
lead 0
to 0
nothing 0
but 0
dead 0
ends, 0
contradictions, 0
and 0
anomalies. 0

Now, 0
let’s 0
assume 0
instead 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
telling 0
the 0
truth 0
when 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
framed. 0

In 0
that 0
case, 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
imperative 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
the 0
military 0
keep 0
as 0
tight 0
a 0
lid 0
on 0
their 0
records 0
as 0
possible 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
investigators 0
or 0
investigative 0
reporters 0
would 0
have 0
a 0
difficult 0
time 0
piercing 0
through 0
to 0
the 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
that 0
establishes 0
the 0
frame-up. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
frame-up, 0
the 0
CIA 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
fortify 0
the 0
persona 0
of 0
Oswald, 0
its 0
intelligence 0
agent, 0
as 0
a 0
purported 1
communist. 1

That 1
would 1
enable 1
the 1
CIA 1
to 1
blame 1
the 1
assassination 1
on 1
a 1
communist, 1
which, 0
not 0
coincidentally, 0
was 0
the 0
advice 0
that 0
the 0
Pentagon 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
were 0
doling 0
out 0
to 0
Latin 0
American 0
military 0
dictatorships 0
at 0
the 0
School 0
of 0
the 0
Americas. 0

In 0
cases 0
of 0
covert 0
state-sponsored 0
assassinations, 0
Latin 0
American 0
regimes 0
were 0
taught, 0
a 1
good 1
strategy 1
was 1
to 1
blame 1
the 1
assassination 1
on 1
a 1
communist 1
because 1
then 1
they 1
could 1
smear 1
anyone 1
who 1
challenged 1
the 1
official 1
story 1
as 1
a 1
communist 1
sympathizer. 1

It 0
would 0
also 0
explain 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
closely 0
monitoring 0
Oswald’s 0
movements 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
assassination, 0
something 0
else 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
kept 0
secret 0
for 0
decades. 0

They 1
had 1
to 1
make 1
certain 1
that 1
Oswald 1
was 1
not 1
on 1
to 1
them 1
and 1
had 1
not 1
discovered 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
set 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
frame-up. 1

The 0
first 0
organization 0
that 0
came 0
out 0
with 0
a 0
press 0
release 0
advertising 0
Oswald’s 0
bona 0
fides 0
was 0
the 0
DRE, 0
an 0
anti-communist 0
group 0
in 0
New 0
Orleans 0
with 0
which 0
Oswald 0
had 0
had 0
contact. 0

What 0
no 0
one 0
knew 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
and 0
what 0
the 0
CIA 0
intentionally 0
kept 0
secret 0
for 0
decades, 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
DRE 0
was 0
a 0
CIA 0
front 0
organization. 0

It 0
was 0
being 0
generously 0
funded 0
by 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
controlled 0
by 0
a 0
secret 0
CIA 0
agent 0
named 0
George 0
Joannides, 0
which 0
the 0
CIA 0
would 0
intentionally 0
keep 0
secret 0
from 0
the 0
Warren 0
Commission 0
in 0
the 0
1960s, 0
the 0
House 0
Select 0
Committee 0
in 0
the 0
1970s, 0
and 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board 0
in 0
the 0
1990s. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
another 0
big 0
operation 0
to 0
establish 0
Oswald’s 0
communist 0
bona 0
fides 0
before 0
the 0
assassination. 0

It 0
had 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Oswald’s 0
trip 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
where 0
he 0
visited 0
the 0
Cuban 0
and 0
Soviet 0
embassies. 0

Something 1
dreadful 1
obviously 0
went 0
wrong 0
with 0
that 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
operation 0
because 0
the 0
official 0
investigation 0
into 0
it 0
was 0
quickly 0
shut 0
down 0
during 0
the 0
early 0
post-assassination 0
period. 0

Today, 0
Oswald’s 0
Mexico 0
City 0
trip, 0
which 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
those 0
CIA 0
records 0
ready 0
to 0
be 0
released, 0
is 0
still 0
shrouded 0
in 0
mystery. 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
continued 0
secrecy 0
in 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
is 0
no 0
big 0
surprise. 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
in 0
my 0
October 0
11 0
article, 0
“Will 0
Trump 0
Make 0
a 0
Deal 0
with 0
the 0
CIA 0
on 0
JFK 0
Records?,” 0
the 0
CIA 0
is 0
between 0
a 0
rock 0
and 0
a 0
hard 0
place. 0

On 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
it 1
knows 1
that 1
those 1
records 1
will 1
further 1
implicate 1
the 1
CIA 1
in 1
the 1
Kennedy 1
assassination. 1

On 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
it 0
knows 0
that 0
by 1
seeking 1
continued 1
secrecy, 1
it’s 1
essentially 1
an 1
implicit 1
acknowledgment 1
of 1
guilt. 1

Not 0
surprisingly, 0
it 0
is 0
choosing 0
the 0
latter 0
course, 0
especially 0
because 1
it 1
knows 1
that 1
its 1
assets 1
and 1
allies 1
in 1
the 1
mainstream 1
press 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
its 1
defense 1
with 0
respect 0
to 0
its 0
ridiculous 0
claim 0
of 0
“national 0
security.” 0

Do 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
long-secret 0
records 0
contain 0
a 0
video-taped 0
confession? 0

Of 0
course 0
not. 0

And 0
they 0
don’t 0
contain 0
any 0
reference 0
to 0
assassinating 0
Kennedy. 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
practice 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
beginning 0
has 0
been 0
to 0
not 0
put 0
any 0
reference 0
to 0
a 0
state-sponsored 0
assassination 0
into 0
writing. 0

But 0
there 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
reason 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
chose 0
to 0
keep 0
this 0
particular 0
batch 0
of 0
records 0
secret 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years. 0

Those 0
long-secret 0
records 0
undoubtedly 0
include 0
small 0
bits 0
of 0
important 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
that 0
fill 0
out 0
even 0
further 0
the 0
mosaic 0
of 0
a 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Dallas 0
in 0
November 0
1963, 0
the 0
same 0
types 0
of 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Iran 0
in 0
1953, 0
Guatemala 0
in 0
1954, 0
Cuba 0
in 0
1960-1963, 0
Congo 0
in 0
1961, 0
and 0
Chile 0
in 0
1973, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
the 1
CIA 1
steadfastly 1
kept 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

In 0
1953, 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
developing 0
a 0
top-secret 0
manual 0
on 0
assassinations, 0
one 0
that 0
showed 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
specializing 0
not 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
art 0
of 0
assassination 0
but 0
also 0
in 0
the 0
art 0
of 0
covering 0
up 0
its 0
role 0
in 0
state-sponsored 0
assassinations. 0

Every 1
American 1
owes 1
it 1
to 1
himself 1
to 1
read 1
that 1
manual. 1

Too 0
bad 0
the 0
mainstream 0
press 0
has 0
never 0
given 0
that 0
manual 0
the 0
consideration 0
it 0
deserves. 0

If 0
it 0
did, 0
it 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
so 0
deferential 0
to 0
the 0
deal 0
that 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
are 0
about 0
to 0
make 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
cover-up 0
by 0
continuing 0
to 1
keep 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
decades-old 1
JFK’s 1
related 1
assassination 1
records 1
secret 1

(WCMH/AP) 0
— 0
The 0
Westerville 0
Division 0
of 0
Police 0
has 0
identified 0
the 0
suspect 0
in 0
the 0
shooting 0
death 0
of 0
two 0
police 0
officers 0
as 0
30-year-old 0
Quentin 0
Lamar 0
Smith. 0

Westerville 0
Police 0
Chief 0
Joe 0
Morbitzer 0
said 0
officer 0
Eric 0
Joering, 0
39, 0
died 0
at 0
the 0
scene 0
and 0
his 0
colleague, 0
Anthony 0
Morelli, 0
54, 0
died 0
at 0
a 0
local 0
hospital. 0

Smith 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
two 0
counts 0
of 0
aggravated 0
murder 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

Morbitzer 0
said 0
the 0
officers 0
were 0
responding 0
to 0
a 0
“potential 0
domestic 0
situation.” 0
A 0
neighbor 0
who 0
heard 0
the 0
gunfire 0
said 0
it 0
happened 0
at 0
a 0
home 0
where 0
the 0
occupants 0
were 0
“always 0
arguing 0
and 0
fighting.” 0
“The 0
officers 0
gave 0
their 0
lives 0
in 0
defense 0
of 0
others,” 0
Morbitzer 0
said 0
during 0
a 0
news 0
conference, 0
struggling 0
to 0
keep 0
his 0
emotions 0
in 0
check. 0

He 0
called 0
them 0
“true 1
American 1
heroes.” 1
The 0
Columbus 0
Police 0
Department 0
is 0
investigating 0
the 0
shootings. 0

Police 0
released 0
incident 0
reports 0
showing 0
officers 0
had 0
been 0
to 0
Smith’s 0
home 0
or 0
had 0
dealings 0
with 0
him 0
several 0
times 0
since 0
2017, 0
some 0
for 0
alleged 0
domestic 0
violence 0
involving 0
a 0
woman 0
identified 0
in 0
the 0
reports 0
as 0
his 0
wife, 0
Candace 0
Smith. 0

Authorities 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
wounded 0
and 0
was 0
treated 0
at 0
a 0
hospital. 0

In 0
a 0
Nov. 0
29 0
incident, 0
Candace 0
Smith, 0
33, 0
went 0
to 0
a 0
police 0
station 0
and 0
asked 0
about 0
protection 0
orders 0
because 0
she 0
said 0
she 0
and 0
her 0
husband 0
weren’t 0
getting 0
along 0
and 0
she 0
discovered 0
she 0
had 0
a 0
sexually 0
transmitted 0
disease. 0

She 0
also 0
told 0
police 0
that 0
when 0
she 0
“threatens 0
to 0
leave 0
Quentin, 0
he 0
tells 0
her 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
kill 0
her, 0
their 0
daughter, 0
and 0
himself,” 0
the 0
report 0
said. 0

Candace 0
Smith 0
told 0
police 0
her 0
husband 0
“has 0
a 0
gun 0
that 0
he 0
carries 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
time, 0
and 0
if 0
it 0
isn’t 0
on 0
him, 0
it 0
is 0
close 0
by.” 0
Police 0
were 0
called 0
to 0
the 0
home 0
later 0
that 0
night 0
to 0
investigate 0
a 0
report 0
of 0
domestic 0
violence. 0

Matt 0

on 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
the 0

during 0

“We 0

Dixon 0

It 0

about 0

It 0
also 0

Bradley 1
McVay, 1
DOS 1
interim 1
general 1
counsel, 1
asked 1
attorneys 1
in 1
Florida 1
to 1
investigate 1
the 1
conflicting 1
dates. 1

“Altering 1
a 1
form 1
in 1
a 1
manner 1
that 1
provides 1
the 1
incorrect 1
date 1
for 1
a 1
voter 1
to 1
cure 1
a 1
defect 1
… 1
imposes 1
a 1
burden 1
on 1
the 1
voter 1
significant 1
enough 1
to 1
frustrate 1
the 1
voter’s 1
ability 1
to 1
vote,” 1
McVay 1
wrote 1
in 1
a 1
letter, 1
sent 1
on 1
Nov. 1
9 1
and 1
publicly 1
released 1
on 1
Tuesday. 1

According 0
to 0
DOS 0
officials, 0
they 0
are 0
less 0
concerned 0
with 0
the 0
inaccurate 0
dates, 0
and 0
more 0
concerned 0
with 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
cure 0
affidavits 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
deliberately 0
altered. 0

State 0
officials 0
turned 0
over 0
the 0
altered 0
forms 0
to 0
federal 0
investigators. 0

Of 0
the 0
many 0
allegations 0
of 0
ballot 0
mishandling 0
in 0
Florida, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
federal 0
government. 0

While 0
Democrats 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
told 0
voters 0
they 0
could 0
fix 0
ballot 0
errors 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
Thursday 0
after 0
Election 0
Day 0
— 0
these 0
votes 0
could 0
not 0
count. 0

It 1
looks 1
like 1
Democrats 1
may 1
have 1
hurt 1
their 1
own 1
interests 1
by 1
misleading 1
their 1
voters. 1

They 1
may 1
have 1
believed 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
supplying 1
the 1
correct 1
information, 1
but 1
they 1
still 1
should 1
not 1
have 1
altered 1
official 1
documents 1
without 1
verifying 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
right, 1
which 1
they 1
weren’t. 1

It 0
is 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
determined 0
whether 0
the 0
federal 0
investigation 0
will 0
find 0
Democratic 1
ineptitude 1
or 1
deception 1
in 0
this 0
case. 0

Madagascar 0
Outbreak: 0
It 1
Is 1
‘Inevitable’ 1
The 1
Plague 1
Becomes 1
Resistant 1
To 1
Drugs 1

The 0
newest 0
warning 0
about 0
the 0
outbreak 0
of 0
the 0
airborne 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
or 0
black 1
death, 1
in 0
Madagascar 0
has 0
been 0
released. 0

Officials 0
warn 0
that 0
it’s 1
inevitable 1
that 1
this 1
bacterial 1
infection 1
that’s 0
infected 0
over 0
2000 0
people 0
will 0
become 0
resistant 0
to 0
antibiotics. 0

The 0
only 0
way 0
to 0
treat 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
contracted 0
the 0
plague 0
is 0
with 0
antibiotics. 0

But 0
experts 0
now 0
warn 0
that 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
used 0
so 0
much 0
to 0
treat 0
the 0
infection, 0
antibiotics 1
resistance 1
is 1
inevitable 1
and 0
making 1
this 1
disease 1
much 1
more 1
terrifying. 1

Once 0
the 0
bacteria 0
is 0
resistant, 0
the 0
Madagascar 0
healthcare 0
system 0
will 0
be 0
overwhelmed, 0
and 0
the 0
disease 0
will 0
have 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
nation. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Mail, 0
Madagascar’s 1
healthcare 1
system 1
will 1
be 1
unable 1
to 1
cope 1
if 1
the 1
deadly 1
plague 1
outbreak 1
continues 1
to 1
escalate, 1
a 0
scientist 0
has 0
warned. 0

Scores 0
of 0
doctors 0
and 0
nurses 0
have 0
been 0
struck 0
down 0
with 0
the 0
disease, 0
which 0
is 0
predicted 0
to 0
gather 0
momentum 0
in 0
the 0
coming 0
weeks 0
and 0
there 0
are 0
growing 0
fears 0
hospitals 0
will 0
be 0
unable 0
to 0
meet 0
the 0
illness’ 0
burden. 0

Official 0
figures 0
reveal 0
at 0
least 0
2,034 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
infected 0
with 0
the 0
“medieval 0
disease” 0
so 0
far 0
in 0
what 0
has 0
been 0
described 0
as 0
the 1
“worst 1
outbreak 1
in 1
50 1
years.” 1
The 0
black 1
death 1
outbreak 0
has 0
so 0
far 0
claimed 0
at 0
least 0
165 0
lives. 0

Although 0
the 0
plague 0
is 0
responding 0
well 0
to 0
antibiotics 0
right 0
now, 0
drug 1
resistance 1
is 1
also 1
an 1
increasing 1
concern 1
amongst 0
experts 0
who 0
predict 0
it 0
will 0
vastly 0
accelerate 0
the 0
disease’s 0
death 0
toll. 0

Professor 0
John 0
Joe 0
McFadden 0
from 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
Surrey 0
told 0
MailOnline: 0
“Fortunately 0
in 0
[the] 0
plague, 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
developed 0
much 0
antibiotic 0
resistance. 0

If 1
that 1
kicks 1
in, 1
the 1
plague 1
will 1
be 1
far, 1
far 1
scarier. 1

If 0
you 0
throw 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
antibiotics 0
at 0
patients, 0
antibiotic 1
resistance 1
is 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
inevitable.” 1

Dr. 0
Derek 0
Gatherer, 0
from 0
Lancaster 0
University’s 0
biomedical 0
and 0
life-sciences 0
department, 0
told 0
MailOnline 0
the 0
country 0
would 0
struggle 0
“to 0
cope” 0
if 0
cases 0
continue 0
to 0
spiral. 0

“Madagascar, 0
typically 0
like 0
many 0
African 0
countries, 0
doesn’t 0
have 0
many 0
doctors. 0

There 0
are 0
around 0
three-and-a-half 0
thousand 0
doctors 0
for 0
22 0
million 0
people. 0

They 0
only 0
have 0
around 0
6,000 0
hospital 0
beds, 0
so 0
they 0
aren’t 0
particularly 0
well 0
positioned 0
to 0
cope 0
with 0
these 0
kind 0
of 0
events. 0

And 0
if 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
for 0
the 0
international 0
aid 0
coming 0
in 0
things 0
would 0
definitely 0
be 0
much 0
worse 0
for 0
them.” 0

And 0
experts 0
continue 0
to 0
fear 0
the 0
healthcare 0
system 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
brink 0
of 0
being 0
overwhelmed. 0

Should 0
the 0
disease 0
actually 0
spread 0
to 0
the 0
African 0
mainland, 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
all 0
but 0
impossible 0
to 0
control 0
and 0
the 0
health 0
care 0

Notice 0
how 0
quickly 0
the 0
drive-by 0
media 0
and 0
self-proclaimed 0
"fact 0

gunned 1
down 1
the 0

Infowars 0
with 0

all 0

Jim 0

are 0
lying 1
through 0
their 0

Yep, 0
I 0

too, 0

now 0
they're 0

but 0
I'm 0

Jim 0
Acosta, 0
you're 0
lying. 1

New 0

Times, 0
you're 0
lying. 1

Every 0
media 0
outlet 0
from 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
to 0
NBC, 0
you're 0
lying 1
when 0
you 0
say 0
the 0
video 0
was 0
doctored 0
and 0
that 0
Acosta 0
didn't 0
touch 0
the 0
woman. 0

At 0
least 0
C-SPAN 0
is 0
neutral 0
in 0
the 0
matter 0
and 0
simply 0
let 0
the 0
video 0
reprove 0
every 0
single 0
one 0
of 0
them. 0

But 0
it's 0
more 0
than 0
that, 0
self-proclaimed 1
"fact 1
checkers" 1
like 0
Snopes 0
simply 0
posted 0
an 0
Associated 0
Press 0
article, 0
which 0
clearly 0
biased 0
towards 0
indicating 0
the 0
video 0
was 0
"doctored" 0
by 0
saying 0
it 0
was 0
sped 0
up, 0
but 0
that's 0
not 0
doctoring. 0

Doctoring 0
is 0
when 0
you 0
manipulate 0
the 0
content 0
to 0
misconstrue 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
what 0
took 0
place. 0

If 1
you 1
want 1
to 1

doctoring, 1
go 1
to 1
0:58 1
of 1
the 1
video 1
above, 1
and 1
don't 1
be 1
drinking 1
anything 1
when 1
you 1
do 1
because 1
it's 1
hilarious. 1

But 0
it 0
isn't 0
just 0
Snopes 0
or 0
Politifact 0
and 0
outlets 0
like 0
that. 0

Take, 0
for 0
instance, 0
websites 0
like 0
MediaBiasFactCheck.com, 0
whom 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
have 0
my 0

send 0

their 0
libel 0
and 0
they 0
didn't 0
just 0
correct 0
it, 0
they 0
removed 0
it 0
entirely 0
because 0
they 0
knew 0
I 0
was 0
two 0
days 0
away 0
from 0
filing 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
them. 0

MBFC 0
actually 0
called 0
CNN 0
"left 1

which 0
is 0
correct 0
but 0
followed 0
up 0
with: 0

Overall, 0
we 0
rate 0
CNN 0
left 0
biased 0
based 0
on 0
story 0

that 0

the 0

due 0
to 0
misinformation 0
and 0
failed 0
fact 0

from 0

However, 0
CNN’s 0
straight 0

to 0

yes, 0
yes, 0
he 0

Not 0
only 0
that 0
but 0
it 0
appears 0
the 0
MBFC 0
doesn't 0
know 0
the 0
documented 0
history 0
of 0
CNN's 0
complete 0
fabrication 0
of 0

It 0
isn't 0
just 0
MBFC 0
though. 0

Newcomer 0
NewsGuard 0
also 0
covers 0
for 0

This 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
outlet, 0
at 0
least 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
told 0
in 0
email 0
and 0
phone 0
communication, 0
that 0
is 0
simply 0
to 0
determine 0
transparency 0
of 0
websites. 0

Instead, 0
they 0
not 0
only 0
do 0
that, 0
but 0
they 0
go 0
on 0
to 0
do 0
far 0
more 0
than 0
that. 0

In 0
rating 0
CNN, 0
NewsGuard 0
posts 0
this 0
nonsense. 1

I'm 0
sure 0
NewsGuard, 0
Yemile 0
Bucay, 0
Anna-Sophie 0
Harling 0
and 0
Amy 0
Westfeldt 0
need 0
to 0
update 0
this 0
in 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
obvious 0
lies 1
and 0
editing 0
of 0
the 0
Acosta 0

decades 0
of 0
documented, 0
outright 1
lies 1
and 0
propaganda 1
by 0
the 0
Clown 1
News 1
Network, 1
but 0
you 0
can't 0
expect 0
real 0
transparency 0
from 0
an 0
outlet 0
like 0
Newsguard 0
whose 0
writers 0
aren't 0
transparent 0
about 0
their 0
own 0
political 0
bias, 0
can 0
you? 0

Nope, 0
you 1
can't, 1
and 0
you 1
can't 1
expect 0
it 0
when 0
some 0
of 0
those 0
writers 0
write 0
for 0
other 0
publications 0
that 0
don't 0
measure 0
up 0
to 0
NewsGuard's 0
standards 0
either. 0

The 0
reason 0
this 0
little 0
incident 0
shouldn't 0
be 0
let 0
go 0
of 0
so 0
soon 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
clearest 0
demonstrations 0
of 0
the 0
media's 0
bias, 0
which 0
we 0
all 0
have, 0
lies 1
and 0
propaganda. 1

It 0
should 0
be 0
used 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
in 0
article 0
after 0
article 0
to 0
remind 0
people 0
about 0
the 0
total 1
dishonesty 1
and 0
complete 1
disregard 1
for 0
reporting 0
the 0
facts 0
by 0
outlets 0
such 0
as 0
CNN 0
and 0
to 0
not 0
blindly 0
trust 0
self-proclaimed 1
fact-checkers 1
who 0
will 0
not 0
tell 0
you 0
the 0
truth 0
either. 0

CNN 0
has 0
lost 1
its 1
mind 1
to 0
the 0
point 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
suing 0
over 0
Acosta 0
losing 0
his 0
press 0
pass. 0

He 1
was 1
their 1
inside 1
boy, 1
after 0
all. 0

But 0
the 0
real 0
irony 0
here 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
media 0
labeled 0
Paul 0
Joseph 0
Watson 0
and 0
Infowars 0
as 0
"conspiracy 1
theorists" 1
and 0
yet, 0
PJW 0
has 0
exposed 0
their 0
blatant 1
conspiracy 1
to 0
smear 0
President 0
Trump, 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
and 0
the 0
White 0

And 0
Jim 0
Acosta 0
believes 0
he 0
and 0
CNN 0
deal 0
with 0
facts 0
and 0
Infowars 0
doesn't. 0

Yeah, 0
right! 0

I'm 0
sorry 0

I 0
can't 0
hear 0

the 0
booming 1

The 0

stood 0
down 0
on 0
Monday 0
from 0
its 0
nearly 0
two-week-long 0
dispute 0
with 0
CNN 0
over 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
credentials 0
of 0
Mr. 0
Acosta, 0
informing 0
the 0
correspondent 0
that 0
his 0
badge 0
was 0
formally 0
restored. 0

CNN 0
in 0
turn 0
dropped 0
its 0
lawsuit 0
on 0
the 0
matter, 0
which 0
had 0
ballooned 1
into 0
a 0
test 0
of 0
press 0
freedoms 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
era. 0

But 0

while 0
it 0
yielded 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
— 0
whose 0
testy 1
questions 0
had 0
touched 0
off 0
Mr. 0
Trump’s 0
ire 1
— 0
the 0
administration 0
used 0
the 0
occasion 0
to 0
lay 0
down 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
formal 0
rules 0
governing 0
reporters’ 0
behavior 0
at 0
future 0
White 0
House 0
news 0
conferences, 0
a 0
highly 0
unusual 0
step. 0

Among 0

the 0
guidelines 0
was 0
a 0
restriction 0
of 0
one 0
question 0
per 0
reporter, 0
with 0
follow-ups 0
allowed 0
at 0
the 0
discretion 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
or 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
official 0
at 0
the 0
lectern. 0

“Failure 0
to 0
abide,” 0
the 0
administration 0
warned, 0
“may 0
result 0
in 0
suspension 0
or 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
hard 0
pass.” 0

The 0

White 0
House 0
sought 0
to 0
blame 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
for 0
behaving 0
disrespectfully, 0
although 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
often 0
lobs 0
insults 1
at 0
journalists 0
and 0
encourages 0
a 0
free-for-all 0
format 0
when 0
taking 0
questions 0
from 0
reporters. 0

Codifying 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0
journalists 0
struck 0
some 0
as 0
an 0
ominous 1
encroachment 1
into 0
freedom 0
of 0
the 0
press, 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
said 0
on 0
Monday 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
not 0
been 0
consulted 0
about 0
the 0
new 0
guidelines. 0

The 0

American 0
Civil 0
Liberties 0
Union, 0
in 0
a 0
statement, 0
said: 0
“These 0
rules 0
give 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
far 0
too 0
much 0
discretion 0
to 0
avoid 0
real 0
scrutiny. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
belongs 0
to 0
the 0
public, 0
not 0
the 0
president, 0
and 0
the 0
job 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
is 0
to 0
ask 0
hard 0
questions, 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
polite 0
company.” 0

Still, 0
the 0
guidelines 0
are 0
not 0
far 0
removed 0
from 0
the 0
manner 0
in 0
which 0
White 0
House 0
news 0
conferences 0
typically 0
proceed. 0

Mr. 0
Trump 0
made 0
clear 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
introduce 0
“regulations” 0
after 0
a 0
federal 0
judge 0
criticized 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
for 0
stripping 0
Mr. 0
Acosta’s 0
credentials 0
without 0
due 0
process 0
or 0
a 0
coherent 0
rationale. 0

“We 0

would 0
have 0
greatly 0
preferred 0
to 0
continue 0
hosting 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
understood 0
professional 0
norms, 0
and 0
we 0
believe 0
the 0
overwhelming 0
majority 0
of 0
journalists 0
covering 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
share 0
that 0
preference,” 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders, 0
the 0
press 0
secretary, 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

Press 0

relations 0
were 0
not 0
always 0
rosy 0
in 0
pre-Trump 0
days. 0

President 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
aides 0
preselected 0
the 0
news 0
outlets 0
that 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
ask 0
questions 0
at 0
his 0
news 0
conferences. 0

Mr. 0
Obama 0
often 0
chastised 0
reporters, 0
including 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
on 0
one 0
occasion, 0
for 0
questions 0
he 0
deemed 0
overly 1
aggressive 1
or 0
grandstanding. 1

But 0
Mr. 0
Trump, 0
a 0
devoted 1
news 1
consumer 1
who 0
relishes 0
his 0
coverage, 0
plays 0
up 0
his 0
conflicts 0
with 0
reporters 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
excite 0
his 0
supporters. 0

He 0
has 0
held 0
far 0
fewer 0
formal 0
news 0
conferences 0
than 0
his 0
predecessors, 0
and 0
the 0
daily 0
White 0
House 0
briefing 0
has 0
virtually 0
disappeared 0
on 0
his 0
watch. 0

Revoking 0

Mr. 0
Acosta’s 0
White 0
House 0
badge 0
was 0
the 0
most 0
severe 1
step 0
yet, 0
and 0
it 0
soon 0
became 0
apparent 0
that 0
the 0
move 0
would 0
not 0
pass 0
legal 0
muster: 0
After 0
suing 0
last 0
week, 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
was 0
granted 0
the 0
temporary 0
return 0
of 0
his 0
credentials 0
by 0
a 0
federal 0
judge. 0

A 0

back-and-forth 0
ensued 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

Bill 0
Shine, 0
the 0
deputy 0
chief 0

that 0
listed 0
several 0
reasons 0
that 0
his 0
pass 0

been 0

perhaps 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
satisfy 0
the 0
judge’s 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
clear 0
rationale. 0

CNN’s 0
lawyers 0
called 0
the 0
note 0
an 0
“after-the-fact 0
concocted 0
process.” 0
By 0
Monday 0
afternoon, 0
the 0
sides 0
had 0
reached 0
a 0
resolution. 0

Aides 0

to 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
does 0
not 0
mind 0
answering 0
questions, 0
pointing 0
to 0
his 0
numerous 0
impromptu 0
sessions 0
with 0
reporters 0
during 0
White 0
House 0
photo-ops 0
and 0
Marine 0
One 0
departures. 0

The 0
aides 0
complain 0
about 0
reporters 0
who 0
they 0
say 0
do 0
not 0
respect 0
the 0
solemnity 0
of 0
the 0
setting, 0
even 0
as 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
flouts 1
many 0
of 0
the 0
norms 0
associated 0
with 0
his 0
office. 0

“The 0

White 0
House’s 0
interaction 0
is, 0
and 0
generally 0
should 0
be, 0
subject 0
to 0
a 0
natural 0
give-and-take,” 0
Ms. 0
Sanders 0
wrote 0
on 0
Monday, 0
suggesting 0
that 0
the 0
onus 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
press 0
corps 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
a 0
“code 0
of 0
conduct” 0
did 0
not 0
become 0
necessary. 0

That 0

notion 0
read 0
more 0
like 0
a 0
warning 0
— 0
behave 1
or 1
else 1
— 0
and 0
the 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
seemed 0
unmoved. 0

“For 0

as 0
long 0
as 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
conferences, 0
White 0
House 0
reporters 0
have 0
asked 0
follow-up 0
questions,” 0
the 0

wrote 0
on 0
Monday. 0

“We 0
fully 0

continue.” 0

Obama’s 0
Treason: 1
Even 1
Worse 1
Than 0
We 0
Thought 0

The 0
Washington 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
reported 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
“the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
skirted 0
key 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
to 0
grant 0
Iran 0
access 0
to 0
billions 0
in 0
hard 0
currency 0
despite 0
public 0
assurances 0
the 0
administration 0
was 0
engaged 0
in 0
no 0
such 0
action, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
congressional 0
investigation.” 0

And 0
it 0
gets 0
even 1
worse: 1
“The 0
investigation, 0
published 0
Wednesday 0
by 0
the 0
House 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigations, 0
further 0
discloses 0
secret 0
efforts 0
by 0
top 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
to 0
assure 0
European 0
countries 0
they 0
would 0
receive 0
a 0
pass 0
from 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
if 0
they 0
engaged 0
in 0
business 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

This 0
revelation 0
comes 0
after 0
the 0
news 0
that 0
came 0
to 0
light 0
in 0
February, 0
that, 0
according 0
to 0
Bill 0
Gertz 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Times, 0
“the 0
U.S. 0
government 0
has 0
traced 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
$1.7 0
billion 0
released 0
to 0
Iran 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
to 0
Iranian-backed 0
terrorists 0
in 0
the 0
two 0
years 0
since 0
the 0
cash 0
was 0
transferred.” 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
law 0
that 0
applies 0
to 0
this 0
situation. 0

U.S. 0
Code 0
2381 0
says: 0
“Whoever, 0
owing 0
allegiance 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
levies 0
war 0
against 0
them 0
or 0
adheres 0
to 0
their 0
enemies, 0
giving 0
them 0
aid 0
and 0
comfort 0
within 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
elsewhere, 0
is 0
guilty 0
of 0
treason 1
and 0
shall 0
suffer 0
death, 0
or 0
shall 0
be 0
imprisoned 0
not 0
less 0
than 0
five 0
years 0
and 0
fined 0
under 0
this 0
title 0
but 0
not 0
less 0
than 0
$10,000; 0
and 0
shall 0
be 0
incapable 0
of 0
holding 0
any 0
office 0
under 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0

In 0
a 0
sane 0
political 0
environment, 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
would 0
be 0
tried 0
for 0
treason. 1

Barack 0
Hussein 0
Obama 0
has 0
planted 0
seeds 0
that 0
will 0
be 0
bearing 0
bitter 0
fruit 0
for 1
years, 1
and 1
probably 1
decades, 1
to 0
come. 0

He 0
is, 0
without 0
any 0
doubt, 0
the 1
worst 1
President 0
in 0
American 0
history. 0

Fillmore, 0
Pierce, 0
Buchanan? 0

Yes, 0
the 0
doughface 0
Presidents 0
made 0
the 0
Civil 0
War 0
inevitable, 0
but 0
worse 0
came 0
later. 0

Grant? 0

Blind 1
to 1
corruption 1
and 0
out 0
of 0
his 0
depth, 0
but 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
worse 0
than 0
he 0
as 0
well. 0

Wilson? 0

That 0
black-hearted 1
Presbyterian 1
bigot 1
arguably 0
gave 0
the 0
world 0
Hitler 0
and 0
World 0
War 0
II, 0
so 0
he 0
is 0
definitely 0
in 0
the 0
Final 0
Four. 0

Harding? 0

Nah: 0
his 0
tax 0
cuts 0
and 0
return 0
to 0
“normalcy” 0
got 0
the 0
American 0
economy, 0
and 0
the 0
Twenties, 0
roaring. 0

FDR 0
and 0
LBJ 0
gave 0
us 0
the 0
modern 0
welfare 0
state 0
and 0
dependent 0
classes 0
automatically 0
voting 0
Democrat; 0
the 0
full 0
bill 0
on 0
the 0
damage 0
they 0
did 0
hasn’t 0
yet 0
been 0
presented. 0

Nixon? 0

A 0
crook 1
and 1
an 1
economic 1
Leftist, 1
who 0
betrayed 0
Taiwan 0
for 0
the 0
People’s 0
Republic; 0
his 0
record 0
certainly 0
isn’t 0
good. 0

Carter? 0

Nothing 1
good 1
can 0
be 0
said 0
about 0
his 0
four 0
years 0
of 0
sanctimony 0
and 0
incompetence. 0

But 0
there 0
is 0
one 0
thing 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
has 0
on 0
all 0
competitors: 0
treason. 1

He 0
showered 0
hundreds 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
on 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran. 0

There 0
are 0
those 0
who 0
say, 0
“It 0
was 0
their 0
money. 0

It 0
belonged 0
to 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government 0
but 0
was 0
frozen 0
and 0
not 0
paid 0
since 0
1979.” 0
Indeed, 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
reason 0
for 0
that: 0
not 0
even 0
Jimmy 0
Carter, 0
who 0
made 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran 0
possible, 0
thought 0
that 0
money, 0
which 0
had 0
been 0
paid 0
by 0
the 0
Shah’s 0
government 0
in 0
a 0
canceled 0
arms 0
deal, 0
belonged 0
to 0
the 0
mullahs 0
who 0
overthrew 0
the 0
Shah. 0

Likewise 0
Reagan, 0
George 0
H. 0
W. 0
Bush, 0
Clinton, 0
and 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
all 0
thought 0
that 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
was 0
not 0
due 0
money 0
that 0
was 0
owed 0
to 0
the 0
Shah. 0

Only 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
did. 0

The 0
definition 0
of 0
treason 1
is 0
giving 0
aid 0
and 0
comfort 0
to 0
the 0
enemy. 0

The 0
leaders 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran 0
order 0
their 0
people 0
to 0
chant 0
“Death 1
to 1
America” 1
in 0
mosques 0
every 0
Friday, 0
and 0
repeatedly 0
vow 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
ultimately 0
destroy 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
and 0
the 0
state 0
of 0
Israel. 0

How 0
was 0
giving 0
them 0
billions 0
and 0
helping 0
them 0
skirt 0
sanctions 0
applied 0
by 0
the 0
U.S. 0
government 0
not 0
treason? 1

Other 0
Presidents 0
have 0
been 0
incompetent, 1
corrupt, 1
dishonest, 1
but 0
which 0
has 0
committed 0
treason 1
on 0
a 0
scale 0
to 0
rival 0
the 0
treason 1
of 0
Barack 0
Obama? 0

The 0
Iranians 0
also 0
operate 0
a 0
global 0
network 0
of 0
jihad 0
terror 0
organizations, 0
one 0
of 0
which, 0
Hizballah, 0
is 0
quite 0
active 0
in 0
Mexico 0
now, 0
with 0
the 0
obvious 0
ultimate 0
intention 0
of 0
crossing 0
the 0
border 0
and 0
committing 1
jihad 1
massacres 1
of 1
Americans. 1

Obama 0
has 0
given 0
a 0
tremendous 1
boost 0
to 0
these 0
initiatives, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
program, 0
with 0
his 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
that 0
has 0
given 0
the 0
Iranians 0
hundreds 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
and 0
essentially 0
a 0
green 0
light 0
to 0
manufacture 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
in 0
exchange 0
for 0
absolutely 0
nothing. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
telling 0
when 0
the 0
worst 0
consequences 0
of 0
Obama’s 0
aid 0
and 0
comfort 0
to 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran 0
will 0
be 0
felt. 0

But 0
they 0
likely 0
will 0
be 0
felt 0
in 0
one 0
way 0
or 0
another. 0

Even 0
as 0
President 0
Trump 0
moves 0
swiftly 0
to 0
restore 0
sanctions 0
and 0
put 0
Iran 0
on 0
notice 0
that 0
its 0
nuclear 0
activity 0
and 0
global 0
adventurism 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
tolerated, 0
those 0
billions 0
cannot 0
be 0
recovered, 0
and 0
the 0
Iranians 0
have 0
already 0
spent 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
for 0
their 0
jihad 0
cause. 0

However 0
this 0
catastrophe 1
plays 0
out, 0
there 0
is 0
one 0
man 0
who 0
will 0
suffer 0
no 0
consequences 0
whatsoever: 0
Barack 0
Obama. 0

That’s 0
Leftist 0
Privilege. 0

It’s 0
good 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
powerful 0
Leftist 0
in 0
Washington 0
nowadays. 0

Laws? 0

Pah! 0

Laws 0
are 0
for 0

House 0
and 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
lawyers 0
said 0
the 0
next 0
decisions 0
are 0
up 0
to 0
Barr. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
that 0
Barr 0
releases 0
two 0
separate 0
reports. 0

One 0
would 0
summarize 0
Mueller’s 0
findings 0
without 0
including 0
classified 0
information 0
and 0
would 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
Congress—and 0
would 0
then 0
most 0
likely 0
find 0
its 0
way 0
out 0
into 0
the 0
public. 0

The 0
other 0
would 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
a 0
smaller 0
group 0
of 0
lawmakers 0
who 0
head 0
major 0
congressional 0
committees, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
House 0
and 0
Senate 0
intelligence 0
committees. 0

Rep. 0
Adam 0
Schiff 0
(D-CA), 0
chairman 0
of 0
House 0
Intelligence, 0
called 0
for 0
transparency. 0

“Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
began 0
as 0
a 0
counterintelligence 0
inquiry 0
into 0
whether 0
individuals 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
were 0
compromised 0
by 0
a 0
foreign 0
power. 0

By 0
law, 0
that 0
evidence 0
he 0
uncovered 0
must 0
be 0
shared 0
with 0
our 0
Committee,” 0
he 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
tweet. 0

“And 0
his 0
report 0
must 0
also 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

Now.” 1

Trump 0
has 0
previously 0
said 0
he 0
supports 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
making 0
the 0
report 0
public. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
mind,” 0
he 0
has 0
said. 0

“I 0
mean, 0
frankly, 0
I 0
told 0
the 0
House, 0
‘If 0
you 0
want, 0
let 0
them 0
see 0
it.’” 0

Trump 0
has 0
also 0
vigorously 0
denied 0
any 0
wrongdoing 0
and 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
branded 0
the 0
probe 0
as 0
a 0
“total 1
witch 1
hunt.” 1

Mueller 0
will 0
remain 0
as 0
special 0
counsel 0
for 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
time 0
as 0
he 0
and 0
a 0
small 0
contingent 0
of 0
staff 0
close 0
the 0
office, 0
a 0
Justice 0
Department 0
spokesperson 0
reportedly 0
said. 0

The 0
handover 0
of 0
the 0
report 0
marks 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
that 0
has 0
for 0
nearly 0
two 0
years 0
transfixed 1
the 1
nation, 1
yielded 0
dozens 0
of 0
indictments 0
and 0
convictions, 0
and 0
brought 0
down 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
closest 0
advisers. 0

The 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
was 0
tasked 0
broadly 0
with 0
investigating 0
any 0
links 0
or 0
coordination 0
between 0
the 0
Russian 0
government 0
and 0
individuals 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
any 0
matters 0
that 0
arose 0
directly 0
from 0
the 0
probe. 0

However, 0
the 0
scope 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
seems 0
to 1
have 1
bled 1
outside 1
those 1
lines. 1

Several 0
witnesses, 0
for 0
example, 0
have 0
been 0
questioned 0
about 0
other 0
countries’ 0
efforts 0
to 0
meddle 0
in 0
American 1
politics, 0
including 0
Saudi 0
Arabia, 0
Israel, 0
the 0
UAE 0
and 0
Qatar. 0

So 0
far, 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
has 0
indicted 0
or 0
obtained 0
guilty 0
pleas 0
from 0
34 0
people 0
and 0
three 0
companies. 0

Six 0
of 0
those 0
are 0
former 0
Trump 0
associates, 0
and 0
25 0
of 0
them 0
are 0
Russians. 0

No 0
Americans 0
have 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
conspiring 0
with 0
Russians 0
to 0
meddle 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
elections—at 0
least 0
none 0
the 0
public 0
knows 0
about. 0

But 0
major 0
Trumpworld 1
figures 1
were 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
other 0
crimes, 0
including 0
former 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
Michael 0
Flynn, 0
former 0
campaign 0
chairman 0
Paul 0
Manafort, 0
deputy 0
campaign 0
chairman 0
Richard 0
Gates 0
and 0
Trump's 0
former 0
personal 0
lawyer 0
and 0
fixer 0
Michael 0
Cohen. 0

Cohen 0
has 0
been 0
sentenced 0
to 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
crimes 0
he 0
committed 0
while 0
working 0
for 0
Trump, 0
including 0
the 0
payments 0
he 0
made 0
to 0
two 0
adult 0
film 0
star 0
actresses 0
for 0
their 0
alleged 0
affairs 0
with 0
his 0
boss. 0

Manafort 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
both 0
Virginia 0
and 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
will 0
serve 0
about 0
seven 0
years 0
in 0
prison. 0

In 0
Washington, 0
Manafort 0
was 0
sentenced 0
for 0
for 0
conspiring 0
against 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
connected 0
to 0
his 0
covert 0
lobbying 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Ukraine’s 0
former 0
pro-Russian 0
government. 0

He 0
was 0
sentenced 0
in 0
Virginia 0
for 0
bank 0
and 0
wire 0
fraud. 0

The 0
Special 0
Counsel’s 0
Office 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
court 0
filing 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
gotten 0
all 0
it 0
can 0
out 0
of 0
Flynn, 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
cooperating 0
for 0
months 0
after 0
pleading 0
guilty 0
in 0
December 0
2017 0
to 0
lying 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
about 0
his 0
interactions 0
with 0
Russian 0
Ambassador 0
Sergei 0
Kislyak. 0

It’s 0
unclear 0
when 0
he 0
will 0
be 0
sentenced 0
but 0
his 0
lawyers 0
want 0
to 0
wait 0
until 0
the 0
trial 0
for 0
his 0
former 0
business 0
partners 0
begins 0
in 0
Virginia. 0

Gates 0
has 0
also 0
been 0
cooperating 0
on 0
a 0
wide 0
variety 0
of 0
topics 0
associated 0
with 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation, 0
including 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Manafort. 0

As 0
of 0
March, 0
Gates 0
was 0
still 0
offering 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team 0
information 0
about 0
his 0
time 0
working 0
for 0
Trump. 0

He 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
in 0
February 0
2018 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
and 0
lying 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

Several 0
other 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agencies 0
have 0
picked 0
up 0
pieces 0
of 0
Mueller’s 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
Attorney’s 0
Office 0
for 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
is 0
actively 0
probing 0
the 0
Trump 0
inaugural 0
committee 0
to 0
determine 0
if 0
it 0
received 0
illegal 0
foreign 0
donations 0
and 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
that 0
money 0
flowed 0
through 0
American 0
intermediaries. 0

The 0
Eastern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
has 0
reportedly 0
taken 0
over 0
some 0
aspects 0
of 0
that 0
probe. 0

SDNY 0
is 0
also 0
looking 0
into 0
the 0
hush 0
money 0
payments 0
Trump 0
made 0
to 0
two 0
former 0
adult 0
film 0
actresses 0
via 0
Cohen. 0

A 0

offices 0
are 0
working 0
on 0
matters 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
Trump 0

and 0

Congress 0

of 0
its 0
own 0
probes 0
into 0
White 0

Security 0
Guard 0
Jesus 0
Campos 0
Shot 0
During 0
The 0
Vegas 0
Massacre 0
Raises 0
New 0
Questions 0
About 0
Official 0
Narrative 0

The 0
infamous 0
security 0
guard 0
at 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Hotel, 0
who 0
was 0
allegedly 0
shot 0
stopping 0
the 0
massacre 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
over 0
a 0
week 0
ago 0
is 0
not 0
listed 0
or 0
registered 0
as 0
such. 0

Jesus 0
Campos, 0
who 0
the 0
narrative 0
is 0
constantly 0
changing 0
around, 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
source 0
of 0
mystery. 0

So 0
who 0
is 0
Jesus 0
Campos? 0

That 0
burning 0
question 0
has 0
bothered 0
many 0
since 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
his 0
name, 0
but 0
there’s 0
been 0
no 0
photograph 0
of 0
this 0
alleged 0
hero, 0
even 0
though 0
we’ve 0
already 0
seen 0
crime 0
scene 0
images 0
of 0
the 0
guns 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
allegedly 0
dragged 0
up 0
to 0
his 0
32nd-floor 0
hotel 0
room. 0

The 0
ever-changing 0
narrative 0
now 0
though, 0
seems 0
to 0
swirl 0
around 0
this 0
unknown 0
mystery 0
security 0
guard. 0

At 0
first, 0
Campos, 0
a 0
guard 0
at 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Resort 0
and 0
Casino, 0
was 0
hailed 0
a 0
hero 0
for 0
helping 0
guide 0
police 0
to 0
gunman 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
room 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor. 0

Police 0
said 0
Campos 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
the 0
leg 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
Paddock’s 0
assault 0
on 0
concertgoers—potentially 0
distracting 0
the 0
gunman 0
and 0
causing 0
him 0
to 0
panic 0
and 0
kill 0
himself. 0

But 0
now, 0
questions 0
have 0
been 0
raised 0
after 0
Clark 0
County 0
Sheriff 0
Joe 0
Lombardo 0
revised 0
the 0
timeline 0
and 0
said 0
Campos 0
had 0
actually 0
been 0
shot 0
about 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
a 0
(full 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began 0
at 0
10:05 0
p.m.) 0
which 0
means 0
the 0
guard 0
could 0
have 0
instead 0
led 0
Paddock 0
to 0
start 0
opening 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
crowd 0
for 0
fear 0
of 0
being 0
caught. 0

Police 0
have 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
difficult 0
to 0
identify 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
bullets 0
during 0
the 0
attack, 0
and 0
the 0
confusion 0
added 0
more 0
minutes 0
to 0
their 0
lengthy 0
response. 0

But 0
the 0
revised 0
timeline 0
shows 0
officers 0
would 0
have 0
known 0
where 0
Paddock 0
was 0
before 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
even 0
started. 0

Did 0
Campos 0
call 0
911? 0

What 0
happened 0
during 0
those 0
six 0
minutes? 0

Much 0
of 0
Campos’s 0
story 0
and 0
background 0
remains 0
a 0
mystery. 0

–Newsweek 0

Campos’s 0
co-worker 0
Liliana 0
Rodriguez 0
started 0
a 0
GoFundMe 0
account 0
for 0
him 0
on 0
October 0
3, 0
explaining 0
that 0
he’d 0
been 0
shot 0
while 0
on 0
“random 0
patrol” 0
and 0
it 0
could 0
have 0
been 0
anyone 0
of 0
us. 0

“Funds 0
will 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
provide 0
relief 0
and 0
financial 0
support 0
for 0
him 0
while 0
he 0
gets 0
back 0
on 0
his 0
feet,” 0
Rodriguez’s 0
online 0
petition 0
says. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
young 0
man 0
that 0
I 0
work 0
with 0
day 0
in 0
and 0
day 0
out. 0

Any 0
financial 0
support 0
would 0
be 0
appreciated 0
for 0
the 0
time 0
he 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
recover.” 0

Strangely, 0
a 0
picture 0
of 0
Campos 0
wasn’t 0
displayed 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
fund 0
because 0
Rodriguez 0
indicated 0
that 0
“due 0
to 0
privacy 0
from 0
the 0
media 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
feel 0
comfortable 0
publishing 0
a 0
photo.” 0

There 1
are 1
obviously 1
certain 1
things 1
that 1
the 1
FBI 1
and 1
other 1
investigators 1
seem 1
intent 1
on 1
covering 1
up. 1

Their 0
own 0
narrative 0
is 0
quickly 0
shattering. 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
Metro 0
Police 0
Undersheriff 0
Kevin 0
McMahill 0
explained 0
more 0
about 0
Campos’s 0
actions 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting, 0
helping 0
fill 0
in 0
some 0
of 0
what 0
happened 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
attack, 0
but 0
unfortunately, 0
it 0
only 0
added 0
more 0
questions 0
and 0
gave 0
little 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
answers. 0

McMahill 0
told 0
KNPR, 0
a 0
local 0
NPR 0
affiliate, 0
that 0
Campos 0
went 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
to 0
investigate 0
a 0
door 0
alarm. 0

While 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor, 0
he 0
found 0
that 0
a 0
stairwell 0
door 0
was 0
jammed 0
and 0
radioed 0
down 0
to 0
maintenance. 0

Campos 0
heard 0
a 0
drilling 0
sound 0
and 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
odd. 0

A 0
maintenance 0
worker 0
came 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor. 0

As 0
the 0
pair 0
started 0
talking, 0
Paddock 0
began 0
firing 0
through 0
the 0
door 0
of 0
his 0
room, 0
first 0
with 0
a 0
single-fire 0
gun 0
and 0
then 0
with 0
a 0
rapid-fire 0
rifle. 0

Police 0
have 0
said 0
that 0
when 0
Campos 0
radioed 0
what 0
happened, 0
it 0
helped 0
them 0
track 0
where 0
Paddock 0
was 0
holed 0
up 0
– 0
so 1
why 1
change 1
the 1
narrative 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
even 1
more 1
unbelievable? 1

And 0
still, 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
explains 0
why 0
Campos 0
is 0
not 0
registered 0
as 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
either, 0
and 0
why 0
the 0
timeline 0
is 0
being 0
changed 0
publically. 0

What 1
exactly 1
do 1
they 1
want 1
us 1
to 1
believe? 1

in 0
a 0

deal 0
involving 0
her 0
then–IT 0
aide 0
Imran 0
Awan, 0
according 0
to 0
two 0
House 0
employees. 0

The 0
dispute 0
came 0
after 0
Awan’s 0
father 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
fraud 0
in 0
relation 0
to 0
the 0
deal, 0
and 0
the 0
mysterious 0
exertion 0
of 0
political 0
influence 0
resulted 0
in 0
Pakistani 0
authorities 0
instead 0
targeting 0
the 0
elderly 0
alleged 0
victims, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0

And 0
when 0
a 0
House 0
Office 0
of 0

found 0
that 0
Awan 0
made 0

including 0
the 0
House 0
Democratic 0

shortly 0
before 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
became 1
“frantic, 1

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
cornered 0
House 0
Chief 0
Administrative 0

Phil 0
Kiko 0
and 0
called 0
him 0
a 0
“fucking 1
Islamophobe,” 1

“you 0

the 0

them. 0

The 0

Awan’s 0
father 0
was 0
facing 0
criminal 0

the 0

into 0
targeting 0
the 0
alleged 0

instead. 0

Awan’s 0

the 0
intervention 0

the 0
foreign 0
criminal 0
matter 0
and 0
that 0
Awan 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
Wasserman 0

who 0
intervened. 0

A 0
fourth 0

— 0
a 0

House 0
IT 0

— 0
previously 0
told 0
TheDCNF 0
that 0
Awan 0
said 0
now-Chicago 0

Rahm 0
Emanuel 0
wasinvolved. 0

Dr. 0
Zafar 0
Iqbal, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
alleged 0

told 0
TheDCNF 0
that 0
“Imran 0

out 0

Ashraf 0
Awan’s 0
business 0
partner 0
in 0
the 0

TheDCNF 0
that 0
the 0

a 0
Pakistani 0
senator 0
who 0
is 0
a 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
a 0
Pakistani 0
intelligence 0
agency, 0
and 0
that 0
Imran 0
claimed 0
his 1
IT 1
position 1
in 1
Congress 1
gave 1
him 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
“change 1

Minhas 0
is 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
an 0

fraud 0
charge. 0

On 0
July 0
25, 0
2016, 0
the 0
House 0
Inspector 0
General 0
notified 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
House 0
Administration 0
that 0
investigators 0
had 0
detected 0
major 0
cybersecurity 0
violations 0
by 0
the 0
Awan 0
family. 0

Awan, 0
his 0
wife, 0
two 0
brothers, 0
his 0
brother’s 0
wife, 0
and 0
even 0
his 0
elderly 0
father 0
were 0
all 0
being 0
paid 0
by 0
various 0
Democrats 0
to 0
manage 0
their 0
servers, 0
with 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
members 0
from 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz’s 0
Florida. 0

The 0
finding 0
came 0
at 0
a 0
critical 0
time 0
for 0
Democrats: 0
It 0
was 0
three 0
days 0
after 0
WikiLeaks 0
published 0
the 0
first 0
emails 0
from 0
a 0
hacked 0
on 0
the 0
DNC, 0
setting 0
the 0
stage 0
for 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
to 0
lose 0
her 0
position 0
as 0
party 0
chair 0
and 0
for 0
Democrats 0
to 0
begin 0
electioneering 0
on 0
a 0
theme 0
of 0
Russian 0
hacking. 0

In 0
February 0
2017, 0
Kiko 0
and 0
the 0
House’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
official, 0
Paul 0
Irving, 0
outlined 0
serious 0
violations 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
committee, 0
and 0
the 0
family 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
the 0
House 0
computer 0
network. 0

The 0
letter 0
also 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
House 0
Democratic 0
Caucus 0
server 0
disappeared 0
soon 0
after 0
the 0
IG 0
report 0
named 0
it 0
as 0
key 0
evidence. 0

But 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
Awan, 0
with 0
her 0
spokesman 0
saying 0
he 0
would 0
work 0
on 0
“websites” 0
and 0
“printers,” 0
which 0
a 0
cybersecurity 0
expert 0
previously 0
told 0
TheDCNF 0
would 0
presumably 0
involve 0
network 0
access. 0

The 0
congresswoman 0
also 0
added 0
Awan’s 0
wife, 0
Hina 0
Alvi, 0
to 0
her 0
payroll 0
in 0
late 0
2016, 0
after 0
the 0
investigation 0
was 0
in 0
full 0
swing, 0
but 0
before 0
the 0
family 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
the 0
network. 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
kept 0
paying 0
her 0
until 0
March 0
17 0
— 0
12 0
days 0
after 0
Alvi 0
went 0
to 0
Pakistan 0
with 0
$12,000 0
in 0
a 0
suitcase. 0

Her 0
actions 0
so 1
rattled 1
the 0
Administration 0
Committee’s 0
Democratic 0
staff 0
director, 0
Jamie 0
Fleet, 0
that 0
he 0
planted 0
a 0
negative 0
story 0
in 0
Politico 0
that 0
revealed 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz, 0
his 0
fellow 0
Democrat, 0
was 0
continuing 0
to 0
pay 0
the 0
suspect, 0
two 0
House 0
sources 0
said. 0

The 0
story 0
also 0
said 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
had 0
a 0
“friendly 0
personal 0
relationship” 0
with 0
Awan 0
and 0
Alvi. 0

Fleet 0
did 0
not 0
respond 0
to 0
a 0
request 0
for 0
comment. 0

Kiko 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
April 0
2018 0
hearing 0
spurred 0
by 0
the 0
scandal 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
powerless 0
to 0
stop 0
members 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
a 1
bad 1
actor. 1

“Termination, 0
now 0
it’s 0
the 0
member’s 0
responsibility 0
… 0
We 0
can 0
revoke 0
everything 0
but 0
they 0
could 0
still 0
be 0
employed,” 0
he 0
said. 0

He 0
added 0
that 0
his 0
office 0
should 0
have 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
override 0
members 0
who 0
would 0
want 0
to 0
keep 0
a 1
rule-breaker 1
on 0
the 0
government 0
network. 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
became 0
fixated 0
on 0
finding 0
out 0
everything 0
investigators 0
knew 0
about 0
Awan, 0
the 0
House 0
sources 0
said. 0

House 0
investigators 0
briefed 0
her 0
extensively 0
with 0
significant 0
evidence 0
about 0
Awan 0
and 0
his 0
family, 0
including 0
improper 0
computer 0
evidence. 0

Yet 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement, 0
“my 0
office 0
was 0
provided 0
no 0
evidence 0
to 0
indicate 0
that 0
laws 0
had 0
been 0
broken, 0
which 0
over 0
time, 0
raised 0
troubling 0
concerns 0
about 0
due 0
process, 0
fair 0
treatment 0
and 0
potential 0
ethnic 0
and 0
religious 0
profiling.” 0

Wasserman 1
Schultz 1
was 1
defending 1
someone 1
investigators 1
allegedly 1
told 1
her 1
was 1
suspected 1
of 1
cybersecurity 1
violations, 1
despite 1
having 1
resigned 1
from 1
her 1
position 1
as 1
DNC 1
head 1
following 1
a 1
devastating 1
hack 1
during 1
the 1
2016 1
election. 1

Despite 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz’s 0
relationship 0
with 0
Awan, 0
in 0
April 0
2017 0
— 0
two 0
months 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
the 0
computer 0
network 0
— 0
the 0
IT 0
aide 0
appeared 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
congresswoman 0
at 0
risk. 0

Capitol 0
Police 0
found 0
a 0
laptop 0
with 0
the 0
username 0
RepDWS 0
in 0
a 0
phone 0
booth 0
at 0
midnight 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
Awan’s 0
ID, 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
prosecutors 0
and 0
a 0
note 0
that 0
said 0
“attorney 0
client 0
privilege,” 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
police 0
report. 0

Awan’s 0
ID 0
caused 0
police 0
to 0
tie 0
it 0
to 0
a 0
criminal 0
suspect 0
and 0
seize 0
it, 0
but 0
the 0
note 0
kept 0
them 0
from 0
looking 0
at 0
it. 0

That 0
led 0
to 0
a 0
tense 0
exchange 0
recorded 0
on 0
video 0
in 0
May 0
2017, 0
in 0
which 0
Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
threatened 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
the 0
Capitol 0
Police 0
with 0
“consequences” 0
for 0
not 0
returning 0
the 0
laptop. 0

When 0
he 0
refused, 0
she 0
mulled 0
attempting 0
to 0
restructuring 0
the 0
Capitol 0
Police’s 0
entire 0
board 0
so 0
that 0
her 0
committee 0
would 0
have 0
more 0
leverage 0
over 0
it. 0

House 0
sources 0
told 0
TheDCNF 0
these 0
exchanges 0
were 0
only 0
a 0
public 0
glimpse 0
into 0
numerous 0
such 0
interactions, 0
which 0
were 0
frequently 0
profane, 1
with 1
every 1
official 1
she 1
could 1
buttonhole. 1

One 0
source 0
said 0
she 0
also 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
“made 1
a 1
stink.” 1

Wasserman 0
Schultz 0
hired 0
the 0
House’s 0
former 0
top 0
lawyer, 0
Bill 0
Pittard 0
— 0
who 0
had 0
recently 0
quit 0
the 0
House 0
— 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
block 0
prosecutors 0
from 0
seeing 0
evidence, 0
TheDCNF 0
previously 0
reported.Awan 0
obtained 0
legal 0
representation 0
from 0
two 0
lawyers 0
who 0
began 0
their 0
careers 0
in 0
Miami 0
— 0
one 0
with 0
experience 0
in 0
espionage 0
cases 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
a 0
former 0
aide 0
to 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz’ 0
district 0
includes 0
much 0
of 0
Miami. 0

One 0
of 0
Awan’s 0
lawyers 0
told 0
a 0
judge 0
he 0
felt 0
“very 0
strongly” 0
that 0
prosecutors 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
RepDWS 0
laptop, 0
mounting 0
an 0
attorney-client 0
privilege 0
argument. 0

Prosecutors 0
did 0
not 0
challenge 0
the 0
argument 0
before 0
the 0
judge. 0

In 0
August 0
2017, 0
Imran 0
and 0
Hina 0
were 0
charged 0
with 0
four 0
felony 0
counts 0
for 0
gathering 0
up 0
money 0
under 0
allegedly 0
false 0
circumstances 0
before 0
wiring 0
$300,000 0
to 0
Pakistan 0
in 0
January. 0

Prosecutors 0
said 0
the 0
timing 0
suggests 0
that 0
the 0
Awans 0
had 0
learned 0
of 0
their 0
investigation, 0
which 0
a 0
spokeswoman 0
for 0
Speaker 0
of 0
the 0
House 0
Paul 0
Ryan, 0
AshLee 0
Strong, 0
told 0
TheDCNF 0
was 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
secret. 0

Capitol 0
Police 0
“requested 0
that 0

allowed 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0

credentials 0

because 0
they 0
didn’t 0

she 0
said. 0

Wasserman 0
Schultz’s 0

This 0
stunning 1
tower 1
audio 1
once 0
again 0
provides 0
proof 0
that 0
the 0
entire 0
narrative 0
that 0
claims 0
that 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
operated 0
alone 0
from 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Hotel 0
is 0
complete 1
nonsense 1
and 0
that 0
authorities 1
are 1
actually 1
actively 1
covering 1
up 1
what 1
really 1
happened 1
on 0
that 0
fateful 0
night. 0

While 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
countless 0
stories 0
since 0
the 0
attack 0
that 0
raise 0
the 0
very 0
real 0
possibility 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
false 0
flag, 0
one 0
has 0
stood 0
out 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
released 0
the 0
information 0
died 0
shortly 0
after. 0

As 0
Shepard 0
Ambellas 0
reported 0
in 0
a 0
now 0
viral 0
article, 0
“Kymberley 0
Suchomel, 0
who 0
posted 0
her 0
eyewitness 0
account 0
of 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
massacre 0
in 0
astonishingly 0
vivid 0
detail 0
to 0
her 0
Facebook 0
page 0
on 0
Oct. 0
4, 0
subsequently 0
passed 0
away 0
in 0
her 0
home 0
on 0
Oct. 0
9 0
from 0
what 0
reports 0
are 0
claiming 0
are 0
natural 0
causes.” 0

“Shockingly, 0
just 0
days 0
before 0
her 0
death, 0
Suchomel 0
posted 0
key 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
shooting 0
to 0
Facebook 0
that 0
contradicted 0
the 0
official 0
narrative 0
which 0
claims 0
that 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
was 0
the 0
lone 0
gunman.” 0

From 0
dozens 0
of 0
eyewitness 0
reports, 0
including 0
Suchomel’s, 0
that 0
clearly 0
indicate 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
multiple 0
shooters, 0
to 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
helicopters 0
being 0
used 0
in 0
the 0
attack, 0
the 1
American 1
people 1
are 1
clearly 1
not 1
being 1
told 1
the 1
truth. 1

It 0
is 0
also 0
important 0
to 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
multiple 0
investigative 0
reports 0
conducted 0
by 0
other 0
alternative 0
media 0
outlets 0
have 0
actually 0
named 0
government 0
officials 0
and 0
private 0
companies 0
that 0
may 0
be 0
behind 0
the 0
attack 0
and 0
so 0
far 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
no 0
official 0
denial 0
from 0
either. 0

Liberals 0
Agree 0
– 0
Trump 0
Tougher 0
on 0
Putin 0
than 0
Obama 0
Was 0

Leftwing 0
journalist 0
Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
is 0
no 0
fan 0
of 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
policies, 0
but 0
he 0
simply 0
cannot 0
understand 0
how 0
the 0
leftwing 0
media 0
keeps 0
getting 0
so 0
riled 0
up 0
at 0
everything 0
that 0
Trump 0
does. 0

In 0
Greenwald’s 0
mind, 0
Trump 0
is 0
a 0
fairly 0
standard 1
politician 1
(when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
policies 0
he 0
supports 0
and 0
implements), 0
which 0
is 0
what 0
makes 0
the 0
media’s 0
constant 0
flow 0
of 0
outrage 0
so 0
mystifying. 0

In 0
a 0
recent 0
debate 0
over 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
Hulabaloo, 0
Greenwald 0
told 0
the 0
leftists 0
at 0
Democracy 0
Now! 0

that 0
getting 0
all 0
worked 0
up 0
over 0
Trump’s 0
press 0
conference 0
with 0
Putin 0
was 0
ridiculous. 1

Why? 0

Because, 0
when 0
Trump’s 0
Russia 0
policies 0
are 0
measured 0
against 0
Obama’s… 0
it 0
becomes 0
CLEAR 0
that 0
Trump 1
has 1
obviously 1
been 1
tougher 1
against 1
Russia 1
than 1
Obama 1
ever 1
was. 1

Here’s 0
the 0
crux 0
of 0
Greenwald’s 0
argument: 0

So 0
let 0
me 0
just 0
make 0
two 0
points. 0

Number 0
one 0
is, 0
if 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
President 0
Obama 0
versus 0
President 0
Trump, 0
there’s 0
no 0
question 0
that 0
President 0
Obama 0
was 0
more 0
cooperative 0
with 0
and 0
collaborative 0
with 0
Russia 0
and 0
the 0
Russian 0
agenda 0
than 0
President 0
Trump. 0

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
sent 0
lethal 1
arms 0
to 0
Ukraine—a 0
crucial 0
issue 0
for 0
Putin—which 0
President 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
do. 0

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
bombed 0
the 0
Assad 0
forces 0
in 0
Syria, 0
a 0
client 0
state 0
of 0
Putin, 0
something 0
that 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
do 0
because 0
he 0
didn’t 0
want 0
to 0
provoke 0
Putin. 0

Trump 0
has 0
expelled 0
more 1
Russian 0
diplomats 0
and 0
sanctioned 0
more 1
Russian 0
oligarchs 0
than 0
[Obama] 0
has. 0

Trump 0
undid 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal, 0
which 0
Russia 0
favored, 0
while 0
Obama 0
worked 0
with 0
Russia 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal. 0

So 0
this 0
idea 0
that 0
Trump 0
is 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
a 0
puppet 1
of 0
Putin, 0
that 0
he 0
controls 0
him 0
with 0
blackmail, 0
is 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
stuff 0
that 0
you 0
believe 0
if 0
you 0
read 0
too 0
many 0

Tom 0
Clancy 0
novels 0
but 0
isn’t 0
borne 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
facts. 0

The 0
other 0
issue 0
that 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
make 0
is 0
that, 0
you 0
know, 0
again, 0
this 0
idea 0
that 0
somehow 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
endorsing 0
the 0
repression 0
of 0
other 0
countries’ 0
leaders 0
if 0
you 0
meet 0
with 0
them—it 0
is 0
true 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
never 0
criticized 0
Putin, 0
although 0
he 0
has 0
taken 0
all 0
the 0
steps 0
I 0
just 0
outlined 0
against 0
Putin. 0

But 0
he’s 0
also 0
never 1
criticized 0
Benjamin 0
Netanyahu. 0

He’s 0
also 0
never 1
criticized 0
the 0
incredibly 1
repressive 1
leaders 0
of 0
Saudi 0
Arabia. 0

He’s 0
never 1
criticized 0
the 0
fascist 1
president 0
of 0
the 0
Philippines. 0

It 0
is 0
true 0
President 0
Trump 0
likes 0
fascist 0
and 0
authoritarian 0
leaders, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
problem, 0
but 0
it’s 0
not 0
like 0
Putin 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
leader 0
that 0
he 0
doesn’t 0
criticize. 0
