says 0 4 5
Franken 0 4 5
groped 0 4 5
and 0 4 5
forcibly 0 4 5
kissed 0 4 5
her 0 4 5
during 0 4 5
a 0 4 5
USO 0 4 5
tour 0 4 5
in 0 4 5
2006, 0 4 5
before 0 4 5
the 0 4 5
former 0 4 5
comedian 0 4 5
was 0 4 5
a 0 4 5
senator. 0 4 5

She 0 4 6
says 0 4 6
Franken 0 4 6
"aggressively 1 4 6
stuck 1 4 6
his 1 4 6
tongue 1 4 6
in 1 4 6
my 1 4 6
mouth" 1 4 6
when 0 4 6
the 0 4 6

rehearsed 0 4 6
a 0 4 6
skit 0 4 6
that 0 4 6
featured 0 4 6
a 0 4 6

breasts 0 4 7
as 0 4 7
she 0 4 7
was 0 4 7
sleeping 0 4 7
while 0 4 7

The 0 4 8
senator 0 4 8
apologized 0 4 8
for 0 4 8
the 0 4 8
photo 0 4 8
but 0 4 8
said 0 4 8
he 0 4 8
remembered 0 4 8

differently. 0 4 8

Lindsay 0 4 9

later 0 4 10
said 0 4 10
he 0 4 10
did 0 4 10
not 0 4 10
remember 0 4 10
taking 0 4 10
the 0 4 10
picture 0 4 10
but 0 4 10
"felt 0 4 10
badly" 0 4 10
that 0 4 10
Menz 0 4 10
felt 0 4 10
disrespected. 0 4 10

One 0 4 12
of 0 4 12
the 0 4 12
women 0 4 12
says 0 4 12
Franken 0 4 12
suggested 0 4 12
that 0 4 12
he 0 4 12
and 0 4 12
she 0 4 12
should 0 4 12
go 0 4 12
to 0 4 12
the 0 4 12
bathroom 0 4 12
together. 0 4 12

Franken 0 4 13
said 0 4 13
he 0 4 13
did 0 4 13
not 0 4 13
remember 0 4 13
the 0 4 13

during 0 4 14

following 0 4 15
that 0 4 15
accusation, 0 4 15
Franken's 1 4 15

he 1 4 15
has 1 4 15
not 1 4 15
"intentionally 1 4 15

in" 1 4 15
the 1 4 15
"kind 1 4 15
of 1 4 15
conduct" 1 4 15
described. 1 4 15

A 0 4 16

a 0 4 16
"former 0 4 16

tried 0 4 16

a 0 4 16
"wet, 1 4 16
open-mouthed 1 4 16

during 0 4 16
an 0 4 16

in 0 4 16

not 0 4 17
appeared 0 4 17
to 0 4 17

An 0 4 18

told 0 4 18

She 0 4 19
says 0 4 19
she 0 4 19
avoided 0 4 19
the 0 4 19
kiss, 0 4 19
then 0 4 19
heard 0 4 19
Franken 0 4 19
say 0 4 19
"it's 0 4 19
my 0 4 19
right 0 4 19
as 0 4 19
an 0 4 19
entertainer." 0 4 19

Franken 0 4 20
called 0 4 20
the 0 4 20

that 0 9 21

Wait! 0 16 1

It’s 0 16 2
all 0 16 2
a 0 16 2
MISTRANSLATION! 0 16 2

Thus, 0 16 3
it 0 16 3
took 0 16 3
more 0 16 3
than 0 16 3
a 0 16 3
year-and-a-half 0 16 3

Yet 0 16 4
conscience 0 16 4
can 0 16 4
do 0 16 4
more 0 16 4
than 0 16 4
recognize 0 16 4
that 0 16 4
a 0 16 4

does 0 16 4
not 0 16 4
correspond 0 16 4

to 0 16 4
the 0 16 4
overall 0 16 4
demands 0 16 4
of 0 16 4
the 0 16 4
Gospel. 0 16 4

It 0 16 5
can 0 16 5
also 0 16 5
recognize 0 16 5
with 0 16 5
sincerity 0 16 5
and 0 16 5
honesty 0 16 5
what 0 16 5
for 0 16 5
now 0 16 5
is 0 16 5
the 0 16 5
most 0 16 5
generous 0 16 5
response 0 16 5
which 0 16 5
can 0 16 5
be 0 16 5
given 0 16 5
to 0 16 5
God, 0 16 5
and 0 16 5
come 0 16 5
to 0 16 5
see 0 16 5
with 0 16 5
a 0 16 5
certain 0 16 5
moral 0 16 5
security 0 16 5
that 0 16 5
it 0 16 5
is 0 16 5
what 0 16 5
God 0 16 5
himself 0 16 5
is 0 16 5
asking 0 16 5
amid 0 16 5
the 0 16 5
concrete 0 16 5
complexity 0 16 5
of 0 16 5
one’s 0 16 5
limits, 0 16 5
while 0 16 5
yet 0 16 5
not 0 16 5
fully 0 16 5
the 0 16 5
objective 0 16 5
ideal. 0 16 5

In 0 16 6
other 0 16 6
words, 0 16 6
the 0 16 6
conscience 0 16 6
can 0 16 6
“inform” 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
sinner 0 16 6
that 0 16 6
his 0 16 6
continued 0 16 6
sinning 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
not 0 16 6
only 0 16 6
acceptable 0 16 6
to 0 16 6
God 0 16 6
but 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
even 0 16 6
what 0 16 6
God 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
asking 0 16 6
“for 0 16 6
now,” 0 16 6
given 0 16 6
one’s 0 16 6
particular 0 16 6
“limits.” 0 16 6
This 0 16 6
outrageous 0 16 6
proposition, 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
form 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
situation 0 16 6
ethics 0 16 6
that 0 16 6
strikes 0 16 6
at 0 16 6
the 0 16 6
very 0 16 6
foundation 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
Catholic 0 16 6
moral 0 16 6
teaching, 0 16 6
has 0 16 6
justly 0 16 6
provoked 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
storm 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
criticism 0 16 6
from 0 16 6
lay 0 16 6
and 0 16 6
clerical 0 16 6
defenders 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
the 0 16 6
authentic 0 16 6
Magisterium. 0 16 6

But 0 16 7
it’s 0 16 7
all 0 16 7
a 0 16 7
misunderstanding, 0 16 7

what 0 16 13
does 0 16 13
the 0 16 13

perfectum 0 16 15

obiectivum 0 16 15

Yes, 0 16 16
and 0 16 16
so 0 16 16
what? 0 16 16

Well, 0 16 17
according 0 16 17
to 0 16 17
Fastiggi 0 16 17
and 0 16 17
Goldstein, 0 16 17
while 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
English 0 16 17
translation 0 16 17
reads: 0 16 17
“what 0 16 17

the 0 16 17
Latin 0 16 17
employs 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
word 0 16 17
oblationem, 0 16 17
which 0 16 17
means 0 16 17
offering. 0 16 17

So, 0 16 18
What 0 16 18
the 0 16 18
Pope 0 16 18
Really 0 16 18
Means® 0 16 18

So, 0 16 18
it’s 0 16 18
an 0 16 18
offering 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God, 0 16 18
not 0 16 18
a 0 16 18

to 0 16 18

Big 0 16 19
difference. 0 16 19

But 0 16 20
just 0 16 20
a 0 16 20
moment: 0 16 20
how 0 16 20
can 0 16 20
objectively 0 16 20
immoral 0 16 20
behavior 0 16 20
ever 0 16 20
be 0 16 20
characterized 0 16 20
as 0 16 20
an 0 16 20
“offering” 0 16 20
to 0 16 20
God? 0 16 20

It 0 16 21
would 0 16 21
seem 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
Latin 0 16 21
version 0 16 21

graver 0 16 21
implications 0 16 21
than 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
English 0 16 21
because 0 16 21
it 0 16 21
suggests 0 16 21
that 0 16 21
falling 0 16 21
short 0 16 21
of 0 16 21
what 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
moral 0 16 21
law 0 16 21
requires 0 16 21
is 0 16 21
an 0 16 21
oblation 0 16 21
pleasing 0 16 21
to 0 16 21
God 0 16 21
if 0 16 21
one’s 0 16 21
“limits” 0 16 21
make 0 16 21
obedience 0 16 21
to 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
moral 0 16 21
law 0 16 21
difficult. 0 16 21

And 1 16 22
that 1 16 22
is 1 16 22
exactly 1 16 22
the 1 16 22
nonsense 1 16 22
Fastiggi 1 16 22
and 1 16 22
Goldstein 1 16 22
expect 1 16 22
us 1 16 22
to 1 16 22
swallow: 1 16 22
“Pope 0 16 22
Francis 0 16 22
is 0 16 22
not 0 16 22
talking 0 16 22
about 0 16 22
an 0 16 22
offering 0 16 22
of 0 16 22
an 0 16 22
objectively 0 16 22
sinful 0 16 22
action 0 16 22
but 0 16 22
a 0 16 22
gift 0 16 22
of 0 16 22
self 0 16 22
that 0 16 22
moves 0 16 22
toward 0 16 22
God 0 16 22
and 0 16 22
the 0 16 22
objective 0 16 22
moral 0 16 22
norm.” 0 16 22

So, 0 16 23
our 1 16 23
intrepid 1 16 23
presenters 1 16 23
of 0 16 23
What 0 16 23
the 0 16 23
Pope 0 16 23
Really 0 16 23
Means® 0 16 23
would 0 16 23
have 0 16 23
us 0 16 23
believe 0 16 23
that 0 16 23
objectively 0 16 23
immoral 0 16 23
behavior, 0 16 23
which 0 16 23
is 0 16 23
the 0 16 23
best 0 16 23
one 0 16 23
can 0 16 23
do 0 16 23
according 0 16 23
“the 0 16 23
“concrete 0 16 23
complexity 0 16 23
of 0 16 23
one’s 0 16 23
limits,” 0 16 23
is 0 16 23
no 0 16 23
longer 0 16 23
simply 0 16 23
objectively 0 16 23
immoral 0 16 23
behavior 0 16 23
but 0 16 23
rather 0 16 23
a 0 16 23
gift 0 16 23
of 0 16 23
self 0 16 23
because 0 16 23
it 0 16 23
moves 0 16 23
toward 0 16 23
morally 0 16 23
licit 0 16 23
behavior. 0 16 23

Fastiggi 0 16 24
and 0 16 24
Goldstein 0 16 24
have 0 16 24
managed 0 16 24
to 0 16 24
make 0 16 24
the 0 16 24
problem 0 16 24
even 0 16 24
worse 0 16 24
in 0 16 24
their 0 16 24
attempt 0 16 24
to 0 16 24
explain 0 16 24
it 0 16 24
away. 0 16 24

What 0 16 25
about 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
English 0 16 25
locution 0 16 25
“while 0 16 25
yet 0 16 25
not 0 16 25
fully 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
objective 0 16 25
ideal,” 0 16 25
which 0 16 25
seems 0 16 25
to 0 16 25
reduce 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
negative 0 16 25
precepts 0 16 25
of 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
natural 0 16 25
law 0 16 25
to 0 16 25
mere 0 16 25
ideals? 0 16 25

Not 0 16 26
so, 0 16 26
Fastiggi 0 16 26
and 0 16 26
Goldstein 0 16 26
contend. 0 16 26

Do 0 16 27
not 0 16 27
all 1 16 27
those 1 16 27
ignorant 1 16 27
critics 1 16 27
of 1 16 27
AL 1 16 27
know 0 16 27
that 0 16 27
the 0 16 27
Latin 0 16 27
text 0 16 27
employs 0 16 27
the 0 16 27
phrase 0 16 27
“obiectivum 0 16 27
exemplar,” 0 16 27
which, 0 16 27
translated 0 16 27
literally 0 16 27
into 0 16 27
English 0 16 27
is 0 16 27
“objective 0 16 27
exemplar.” 0 16 27
They 0 16 27
declare 0 16 27
triumphantly: 0 16 27
“The 0 16 27
Latin 0 16 27
term 0 16 27
exemplar 0 16 27
does 0 16 27
not 0 16 27
mean 0 16 27
an 0 16 27
unattainable 0 16 27
ideal, 0 16 27
it 0 16 27
specifically 0 16 27
means 0 16 27
a 0 16 27
pattern 0 16 27
or 0 16 27
model 0 16 27
to 0 16 27
follow.” 0 16 27

Give. 0 16 28

Me. 0 16 29

A. 0 16 30

Break. 0 16 31

A 0 16 32
pattern 0 16 32
or 0 16 32
model 0 16 32
to 0 16 32
follow 0 16 32
is 0 16 32
an 0 16 32
ideal, 0 16 32
as 0 16 32
a 0 16 32
standard 0 16 32
Latin 0 16 32
dictionary 0 16 32
confirms 0 16 32
with 0 16 32
its 0 16 32
definition 0 16 32
of 0 16 32
exemplar: 0 16 32
“(1) 0 16 32
copy/reproduction, 0 16 32
(2) 0 16 32
model, 0 16 32
pattern, 0 16 32
example, 0 16 32
original, 0 16 32
ideal. 0 16 32

Likewise, 0 16 33
the 0 16 33
definition 0 16 33
of 0 16 33
the 0 16 33
English 0 16 33
word 0 16 33
“exemplar” 0 16 33
is 0 16 33
simply: 0 16 33
“an 0 16 33
ideal 0 16 33
model.” 0 16 33

Here 0 16 34
too 0 16 34
Fastiggi 0 16 34
and 0 16 34
Goldsetein 0 16 34
only 0 16 34
worsen 0 16 34
the 0 16 34
problem 0 16 34
they 0 16 34
try 0 16 34
to 0 16 34
explain 0 16 34

away. 0 16 35
For 0 16 35
if 0 16 35
moral 0 16 35
behavior 0 16 35
is 0 16 35
now 0 16 35
to 0 16 35
be 0 16 35
viewed 0 16 35
as 0 16 35
merely 0 16 35
“exemplary” 0 16 35
rather 0 16 35
than 0 16 35
divinely 0 16 35
mandated 0 16 35
by 0 16 35
the 0 16 35
natural 0 16 35
law 0 16 35
that 0 16 35
binds 0 16 35
all 0 16 35
men—including 0 16 35
Thou 0 16 35
Shalt 0 16 35
Not 0 16 35
Commit 0 16 35
Adultery—then 0 16 35
basic 0 16 35
morality 0 16 35
becomes 0 16 35
a 0 16 35
kind 0 16 35
of 0 16 35
heroic 0 16 35
virtue. 0 16 35

Thus, 0 16 36
continence 0 16 36
cannot 0 16 36
realistically 0 16 36
be 0 16 36
expected, 0 16 36
at 0 16 36
least 0 16 36
“for 0 16 36
now” 0 16 36
(AL 0 16 36
303), 0 16 36
of 0 16 36
the 0 16 36
average 0 16 36
Joe 0 16 36
or 0 16 36
Jane 0 16 36
with 0 16 36
an 0 16 36
“ex” 0 16 36
who 0 16 36
has 0 16 36
“remarried” 0 16 36
and 0 16 36
is 0 16 36
now 0 16 36
mired 0 16 36
in 0 16 36
the 0 16 36
“concrete 0 16 36
complexity 0 16 36
one’s 0 16 36
limits.” 0 16 36

So, 0 16 37
as 0 16 37
Fastiggi 0 16 37
and 0 16 37
Goldstein 0 16 37
would 0 16 37
have 0 16 37
it, 0 16 37
all 1 16 37
the 1 16 37
tumult 1 16 37
triggered 1 16 37
by 1 16 37
AL 1 16 37
is 1 16 37
just 1 16 37
a 1 16 37
misunderstanding 1 16 37
caused 1 16 37
by 1 16 37
uninformed 1 16 37
people 1 16 37
who 1 16 37
haven’t 1 16 37
consulted 1 16 37
the 1 16 37
Latin 1 16 37
text—including 0 16 37
those 1 16 37
ignorant 1 16 37
Vatican 1 16 37
translators. 1 16 37

According 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
their 0 16 38
proposed 0 16 38
“alternate 0 16 38
translation” 0 16 38
into 0 16 38
English, 0 16 38
What 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
Pope 0 16 38
Really 0 16 38
Means® 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
that 0 16 38
objectively 0 16 38
immoral 0 16 38
behavior 0 16 38
one 0 16 38
feels 0 16 38
unable 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
correct 0 16 38
due 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
one’s 0 16 38
“limits” 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
“the 0 16 38
offering 0 16 38
that 0 16 38
God 0 16 38
himself 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
asking 0 16 38
amid 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
mass 0 16 38
of 0 16 38
impediments, 0 16 38
although 0 16 38
it 0 16 38
may 0 16 38
not 0 16 38
yet 0 16 38
be 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
perfect 0 16 38
objective 0 16 38
model.” 0 16 38
Which 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
what 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
official 0 16 38
English 0 16 38
translation 0 16 38
already 0 16 38
says 0 16 38
but 0 16 38
with 0 16 38
fewer 0 16 38

words. 0 16 39
It 0 16 39
seems 0 16 39
Fastiggi 0 16 39
and 0 16 39
Goldstein 0 16 39
are 0 16 39
hoping 0 16 39
no 0 16 39
one 0 16 39
will 0 16 39
notice 0 16 39
that 0 16 39
their 0 16 39
linguistic 0 16 39
tinkering 0 16 39
produces 0 16 39
no 0 16 39
real 0 16 39
change 0 16 39
in 0 16 39
meaning 0 16 39
but 0 16 39
only 0 16 39
an 0 16 39
intensification 0 16 39
of 0 16 39
its 0 16 39
perniciousness. 0 16 39

Indeed, 0 16 40
their 0 16 40
“proposed 0 16 40
alternate 0 16 40
translation” 0 16 40
reduces 0 16 40
the 0 16 40
avoidance 0 16 40
of 0 16 40
adulterous 0 16 40
relations 0 16 40
in 0 16 40
“second 0 16 40
marriages” 0 16 40
to 0 16 40
the 0 16 40
“perfect 0 16 40
objective 0 16 40
model.” 0 16 40
Now, 0 16 40
how 0 16 40
could 0 16 40
anyone 0 16 40
but 0 16 40
a 0 16 40
Pharisee 0 16 40
expect 0 16 40
perfection 0 16 40
from 0 16 40
people 0 16 40
living 0 16 40
in 0 16 40
adultery? 0 16 40

Are 0 16 41
you 0 16 41

perfect? 0 16 42
Then 0 16 42
again, 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
Pharisees 0 16 42
are 0 16 42
precisely 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
ones 0 16 42
Our 0 16 42
Lord 0 16 42
condemned 0 16 42
for 0 16 42
accommodating 0 16 42
divorce 0 16 42
and 0 16 42
remarriage 0 16 42
in 0 16 42
violation 0 16 42
of 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
natural 0 16 42

law. 0 16 43
But 1 16 43
such 1 16 43
embarrassing 1 16 43
truths 1 16 43
need 1 16 43
not 1 16 43
impede 1 16 43
the 1 16 43
Bergoglian 1 16 43
Mercy 1 16 43
Train 1 16 43

a 1 16 43

wreck 1 16 43
at 1 16 43
the 1 16 43
end 1 16 43
of 1 16 43
the 1 16 43

line. 1 16 44
And 0 16 44
Fastiggi 0 16 44
and 0 16 44
Goldstein 0 16 44
are 0 16 44
busily 0 16 44
helping 0 16 44
it 0 16 44
along, 0 16 44
changing 0 16 44
red 0 16 44
signals 0 16 44
to 0 16 44

green. 0 16 45
No 0 16 45
problem 0 16 45

here! 0 16 46
has 0 16 46
been 0 16 46
the 0 16 46
mantra 0 16 46
of 0 16 46
the 0 16 46
neo-Catholic 0 16 46
establishment 0 16 46
for 0 16 46
nearly 0 16 46
half 0 16 46
a 0 16 46
century 0 16 46
of 0 16 46
ecclesial 0 16 46
auto-demolition. 0 16 46

But 1 16 47
wait, 1 16 47
there’s 1 16 47

more! 1 16 48
Our 1 16 48
dynamic 1 16 48
translators 1 16 48
even 0 16 48
provide 0 16 48
their 0 16 48
own 0 16 48
dynamic 0 16 48
interpretation 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
AL 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
mean 0 16 48
that 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
“offering” 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
God 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
Francis 0 16 48
speaks 0 16 48
is 0 16 48
merely 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
decision 0 16 48
by 0 16 48
a 0 16 48
divorced 0 16 48
and 0 16 48
“remarried” 0 16 48
couple 0 16 48
with 0 16 48
children 0 16 48
not 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
end 0 16 48
their 0 16 48
relationship, 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
would 0 16 48
be 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
“perfect 0 16 48
objective 0 16 48
model,” 0 16 48
but 0 16 48
rather 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
“live 0 16 48
in 0 16 48
continence 0 16 48
until 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
may—after 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
hoped 0 16 48
for 0 16 48
declaration 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
nullity—enter 0 16 48
into 0 16 48
a 0 16 48
true 0 16 48
marriage.” 0 16 48
That 0 16 48
is, 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
would 0 16 48
have 0 16 48
Francis 0 16 48
affirming 0 16 48
John 0 16 48
Paul 0 16 48
II’s 0 16 48
Familiaris 0 16 48
consortio, 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
repeats 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
Church’s 0 16 48
constant 0 16 48
teaching 0 16 48
that 0 16 48
continence 0 16 48
is 0 16 48
required 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
those 0 16 48
who 0 16 48
have 0 16 48
entered 0 16 48
into 0 16 48
adulterous 0 16 48
“second 0 16 48
marriage,” 0 16 48
failing 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
cannot 0 16 48
be 0 16 48
admitted 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
sacraments. 0 16 48

But 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
Fastiggi-Goldstein 0 16 49
interpretation 0 16 49
is 0 16 49
precisely 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
contrary 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
interpretation 0 16 49
Francis 0 16 49
has 0 16 49
assiduously 0 16 49
promoted 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
which 0 16 49
Fastiggi 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
Goldstein 0 16 49
just 0 16 49
as 0 16 49
assiduously 0 16 49

that 0 16 49
people 0 16 49

not 0 16 49
have 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
live 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
continence, 0 16 49
but 0 16 49
rather—in 0 16 49
“certain 0 16 49
cases”—may 0 16 49
continue 0 16 49
their 0 16 49

during 0 16 49
a 0 16 49

discernment.” 0 16 49
As 0 16 49
we 0 16 49
know, 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
his 0 16 49

This 0 16 52
Pope’s 0 16 52
plan 0 16 52
of 0 16 52
promulgating 0 16 52
a 0 16 52
deliberately 0 16 52
ambiguous 0 16 52
document 0 16 52
whose 0 16 52
heterodox 0 16 52
interpretation 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
application 0 16 52
he 0 16 52
would 0 16 52
later 0 16 52
approve 0 16 52
with 0 16 52

series 0 16 52
of 0 16 52

nods, 0 16 52
both 0 16 52
oral 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
written, 0 16 52
is 0 16 52
the 0 16 52
reason 0 16 52
I 0 16 52
signed 0 16 52
onto 0 16 52
the 0 16 52
Correctio 0 16 52

Filialis. 0 16 53
See 0 16 53
the 0 16 53
piece 0 16 53
by 0 16 53
Joseph 0 16 53
Shaw 0 16 53
in 0 16 53
this 0 16 53

regard. 0 16 54
Shaw 0 16 54
maintains 0 16 54
that 0 16 54
AL 0 16 54
can 0 16 54
be 0 16 54
“bent 0 16 54
into 0 16 54
some 0 16 54
kind 0 16 54
of 0 16 54
orthodoxy.” 0 16 54

Perhaps. 0 16 55
But 0 16 55
it 0 16 55
is 0 16 55
not 0 16 55
our 0 16 55
responsibility 0 16 55
to 0 16 55
bend 0 16 55
a 0 16 55
Pope’s 0 16 55
statements 0 16 55
into 0 16 55
conformity 0 16 55
with 0 16 55

the 0 16 56
Faith. 0 16 56
Moreover, 0 16 56
any 0 16 56
Pope 0 16 56
who 0 16 56
promulgates 0 16 56
a 0 16 56
document 0 16 56
that 0 16 56
can 0 16 56
be 0 16 56
read 0 16 56
as 0 16 56
orthodox 0 16 56
only 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
a 0 16 56
forced 0 16 56
interpretation 0 16 56
imposed 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
certain 0 16 56
readers—while 0 16 56
others 0 16 56
disagree—has 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
that 0 16 56
very 0 16 56
fact 0 16 56
inflicted 0 16 56
grave 0 16 56
harm 0 16 56
upon 0 16 56
on 0 16 56
the 0 16 56
Church, 0 16 56
which 0 16 56
he 0 16 56
alone 0 16 56
has 0 16 56
the 0 16 56
duty 0 16 56

to 0 16 57
correct. 0 16 57
But 0 16 57
Francis, 0 16 57
as 0 16 57
any 0 16 57
reasonable 0 16 57
observer 0 16 57
can 0 16 57
see, 0 16 57
has 0 16 57
no 0 16 57
intention 0 16 57
of 0 16 57
offering 0 16 57
any 0 16 57
such 0 16 57

correction. 0 16 58
Quite 0 16 58
to 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
contrary, 0 16 58
confusion 0 16 58
as 0 16 58
a 0 16 58
cover 0 16 58
for 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
introduction 0 16 58
of 0 16 58
Holy 0 16 58
Communion 0 16 58
for 1 16 58
“certain” 1 16 58
public 1 16 58
adulterers 1 16 58
by 0 16 58
Bergoglio’s 0 16 58
co-conspirators 0 16 58
in 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
Vatican 0 16 58
and 0 16 58
various 0 16 58
dioceses 0 16 58
is 0 16 58
exactly 0 16 58
what 0 16 58
he 0 16 58
was 0 16 58
aiming 0 16 58
to 0 16 58
achieve 0 16 58
from 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
beginning 0 16 58
of 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
whole 0 16 58
synodal 1 16 58
charade, 1 16 58
which 0 16 58
was 0 16 58
merely 0 16 58
a 0 16 58
vehicle 0 16 58
for 0 16 58
promulgation 0 16 58

of 0 16 59
AL. 0 16 59
As 0 16 59
Shaw 0 16 59
observes 0 16 59
of 0 16 59
AL: 0 16 59
“What 0 16 59
we 0 16 59
[the 0 16 59
signers 0 16 59
of 0 16 59
the 0 16 59
Correctio] 0 16 59
are 0 16 59
saying 0 16 59
is 0 16 59
that 0 16 59
it 0 16 59
has 0 16 59
become 0 16 59
clear 0 16 59
that 0 16 59
orthodoxy 0 16 59
is 0 16 59
not 0 16 59
what 0 16 59
Pope 0 16 59
Francis 0 16 59
wants 0 16 59
us 0 16 59
to 0 16 59

find 0 16 60
there.” 0 16 60
In 1 16 60
a 1 16 60
sense, 1 16 60
what 1 16 60
Bergoglio 1 16 60
is 1 16 60
doing 1 16 60
is 1 16 60
worse 1 16 60
than 1 16 60
explicit 1 16 60
heresy, 1 16 60
which 0 16 60
could 0 16 60
at 0 16 60
least 0 16 60
be 0 16 60
readily 0 16 60
identified 0 16 60
and 0 16 60
denounced 0 16 60

as 0 16 61
such. 0 16 61
But 0 16 61
Bergoglio 0 16 61
wants 0 16 61
the 0 16 61
effects 0 16 61
of 0 16 61
heresy—undermining 0 16 61
Holy 0 16 61
Matrimony, 0 16 61
Confession 0 16 61
and 0 16 61
Holy 0 16 61
Communion, 0 16 61
whose 0 16 61
integrity 0 16 61
is 0 16 61
affirmed 0 16 61
verbally—without 0 16 61
the 0 16 61
guilt 0 16 61
of 0 16 61
an 0 16 61
explicit 0 16 61

promulgation. 0 16 62
In 0 16 62
so 0 16 62
acting, 0 16 62
he 0 16 62
is 0 16 62
very 0 16 62
much 0 16 62
in 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
mold 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
Honorius 0 16 62
I, 0 16 62
who 0 16 62
was 0 16 62
posthumously 0 16 62
anathematized 0 16 62
by 0 16 62
an 0 16 62
ecumenical 0 16 62
council 0 16 62
(the 0 16 62
Third 0 16 62
Council 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
Constantinople) 0 16 62
and 0 16 62
by 0 16 62
his 0 16 62
own 0 16 62
successor 0 16 62
(Leo 0 16 62
II) 0 16 62
for 0 16 62
aiding 0 16 62
and 0 16 62
abetting 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
spread 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
Monothelite 0 16 62
heresy 0 16 62
(no 0 16 62
human 0 16 62
but 0 16 62
only 0 16 62
a 0 16 62
divine 0 16 62
will 0 16 62

in 0 16 63
Christ). 0 16 63
Honorius 0 16 63
did 0 16 63
so 0 16 63
by 0 16 63
means 0 16 63
of 0 16 63
private 0 16 63
correspondence 0 16 63
with 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
author 0 16 63
of 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
heresy, 0 16 63
endorsing 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
heresy 0 16 63
without 0 16 63
ever 0 16 63
formally 0 16 63
proclaiming 0 16 63
it 0 16 63

as 0 16 64
doctrine. 0 16 64
And 0 16 64
yet 0 16 64
Honorius 0 16 64
I 0 16 64
is 0 16 64
listed 0 16 64
in 0 16 64
the 0 16 64
canon 0 16 64
of 0 16 64
the 0 16 64
Popes 0 16 64
and 0 16 64
is 0 16 64
not 0 16 64
considered 0 16 64
to 0 16 64
have 0 16 64
fallen 0 16 64
from 0 16 64
office 0 16 64
on 0 16 64
account 0 16 64

of 0 16 65
heresy. 0 16 65
A 0 16 65
similar 0 16 65
judgment 0 16 65
might 0 16 65
well 0 16 65
befall 0 16 65
this 0 16 65
Pope, 0 16 65
but 0 16 65
it 0 16 65
is 0 16 65
not 0 16 65
for 0 16 65
us 0 16 65

to 0 16 66
level 0 16 66
it. 0 16 66
Meanwhile, 0 16 66
as 0 16 66
Fastiggi 0 16 66
and 0 16 66
Goldstein 0 16 66
labor 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
convince 0 16 66
us 0 16 66
that 0 16 66
nothing 0 16 66
is 0 16 66
amiss 0 16 66
with 0 16 66
AL, 0 16 66
Pope 0 16 66
Bergoglio 0 16 66
is 0 16 66
sending 0 16 66
clear 0 16 66
signals 0 16 66
of 0 16 66
concern 0 16 66
about 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
rising 0 16 66
opposition 0 16 66
among 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
faithful 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
his 0 16 66
master 0 16 66
plan 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
subvert 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
Church 0 16 66
according 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
his 0 16 66
false 0 16 66
notion 0 16 66

of 0 16 67
mercy. 0 16 67
In 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
classic 0 16 67
power 0 16 67
move, 0 16 67
he 0 16 67
has 0 16 67
just 0 16 67
given 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
sop 0 16 67
to 0 16 67
Cardinal 0 16 67
Burke, 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
perceived 0 16 67
leader 0 16 67
of 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
opposition, 0 16 67
by 0 16 67
appointing 0 16 67
him 0 16 67
to 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
minor 0 16 67
position 0 16 67
on 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
Apostolic 0 16 67
Signatura—the 0 16 67
same 0 16 67
tribunal 0 16 67
from 0 16 67
which 0 16 67
Bergoglio 0 16 67
brutally 0 16 67
removed 0 16 67
him 0 16 67

as 0 16 68
Prefect. 0 16 68
And 0 16 68
this 0 16 68
after 0 16 68
also 0 16 68
humiliating 0 16 68
Burke 0 16 68
as 0 16 68
the 0 16 68
spiritual 0 16 68
patron 0 16 68
of 0 16 68
the 0 16 68
Knights 0 16 68
of 0 16 68
Malta, 0 16 68
to 0 16 68
which 0 16 68
he 0 16 68
was 0 16 68
exiled 0 16 68
after 0 16 68

his 0 16 69
removal. 0 16 69
Will 0 16 69
this 0 16 69
sop 0 16 69
buy 0 16 69
Burke’s 0 16 69
silence, 0 16 69
staving 0 16 69
off 0 16 69
the 0 16 69
feared 0 16 69
public 0 16 69

correction? 0 16 70
We 0 16 70
will 0 16 70
soon 0 16 70
know 0 16 70
if 0 16 70
the 0 16 70
Cardinal 0 16 70
can 0 16 70
be 0 16 70
bought 0 16 70

so 0 16 71
easily. 0 16 71
But 0 16 71
this 0 16 71
move 0 16 71
demonstrates—if 0 16 71
more 0 16 71
evidence 0 16 71
were 0 16 71
needed—that 0 16 71
Bergoglio 0 16 71
has 0 16 71
never 0 16 71
been 0 16 71
the 1 16 71
humble 1 16 71
apostle 1 16 71
of 1 16 71
mercy 1 16 71
depicted 1 16 71
in 1 16 71
his 1 16 71
carefully 1 16 71
crafted 1 16 71
public 1 16 71
relations 1 16 71
narrative, 1 16 71
but 1 16 71

The 0 22 6

are 0 22 6
Robert 0 22 6

the 0 22 6

advocates 0 22 6
a 0 22 6

He 0 22 7
had 0 22 7
tweeted, 0 22 7
"EU 1 22 7
no 1 22 7
longer 1 22 7
considers 1 22 7
#Hamas 1 22 7
a 1 22 7
terrorist 1 22 7
group. 1 22 7

Time 1 22 8
for 1 22 8
US 1 22 8
to 1 22 8
do 1 22 8
same." 1 22 8

Kuttab 0 22 9
has 0 22 9
defended 0 22 9
Islamic 0 22 9
anti-Semitism 0 22 9
by 0 22 9
claiming 0 22 9
that 0 22 9
the 0 22 9
“distrust 0 22 9
Moslems 0 22 9
feel 0 22 9
towards 0 22 9
Jews” 0 22 9
is 0 22 9
due 0 22 9
to 0 22 9
“two 0 22 9
acts 0 22 9
of 0 22 9
betrayal 0 22 9
by 0 22 9
Jewish 0 22 9
tribes 0 22 9
against 0 22 9
the 0 22 9
Prophet.” 0 22 9
And 0 22 9
that 0 22 9
Jews 0 22 9
suffer 0 22 9
from 0 22 9
a 0 22 9
“Holocaust 1 22 9
Syndrome” 1 22 9
of 1 22 9
entitlement. 1 22 9

He 0 22 10
justified 0 22 10
hijacking 0 22 10
planes, 0 22 10
described 0 22 10
suicide 0 22 10
bombers 0 22 10
as 0 22 10
“taking 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
supreme 0 22 10
sacrifice” 0 22 10
and 0 22 10
defended 0 22 10
Hezbollah 1 22 10
as 1 22 10
“an 1 22 10
armed-resistance 1 22 10
movement” 1 22 10

He 0 22 11
has 0 22 11
claimed 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
"Jewish 0 22 11
community 0 22 11
gradually 0 22 11
consolidated 0 22 11
its 0 22 11

especially 0 22 11
in 0 22 11
"crucial 0 22 11
sectors 0 22 11
like 0 22 11
banking, 0 22 11

where 0 22 11
"their 0 22 11

an 0 22 11

far 0 22 11
exceeded 0 22 11
their 0 22 11
numbers" 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
their 0 22 11
power 0 22 11
strengthens 0 22 11
“conspiracy 0 22 11
theories 0 22 11
about 0 22 11
‘Jewish 0 22 11
control’ 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
are 0 22 11

or 0 22 15
“Jewish 0 22 15

argument 0 22 15
is 0 22 15
a 0 22 15
hook 0 22 15

The 0 22 17
American 0 22 17

Historical 0 22 17
Society 0 22 17
is 0 22 17
not 0 22 17
only 0 22 17
co-sponsoring 0 22 17
a 0 22 17

by 0 22 17
an 0 22 17

But 0 22 18
it’s 0 22 18
also 0 22 18
hosting 0 22 18
it 0 22 18
at 0 22 18
the 0 22 18
Center 0 22 18

AJHS 0 22 19

And 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
partnership 0 22 20
between 0 22 20
AJHS 0 22 20
and 0 22 20
JVP 0 22 20
sheds 0 22 20
light 0 22 20
on 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
controversy 0 22 20
over 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
appointment 0 22 20
of 0 22 20
David 0 22 20
N. 0 22 20
Myers, 0 22 20
an 0 22 20
anti-Israel 0 22 20

to 0 22 20

the 0 22 20
Center 0 22 20
for 0 22 20
Jewish 0 22 20
History. 0 22 20

During 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Myers 0 22 21
controversy, 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Center 0 22 21
took 0 22 21
pains 0 22 21
to 0 22 21
disassociate 0 22 21
Myers 0 22 21
and 0 22 21
themselves 0 22 21
from 0 22 21
JVP 0 22 21
because 0 22 21
a 0 22 21
JVP 0 22 21
handout 0 22 21
had 0 22 21
listed 0 22 21
him 0 22 21
as 0 22 21
a 0 22 21
“JVP 0 22 21
Academic 0 22 21
Advisory 0 22 21
Board 0 22 21
Member.” 0 22 21
But 0 22 21
in 0 22 21
reality 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Center, 0 22 21
through 0 22 21
AJHS, 0 22 21
has 0 22 21
an 0 22 21
ongoing 0 22 21
relationship 0 22 21
with 0 22 21
JVP. 0 22 21

The 0 22 22
Balfour 0 22 22
event 0 22 22
was 0 22 22
not 0 22 22
AJHS’ 0 22 22
only 0 22 22
partnership 0 22 22
with 0 22 22
JVP. 0 22 22

In 0 22 23
December, 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
AJHS 0 22 23
will 0 22 23
feature 0 22 23
“Rubble 0 22 23
Rubble”, 0 22 23
a 0 22 23
play 0 22 23
by 0 22 23
Dan 0 22 23
Fishback 0 22 23
based 0 22 23
on 0 22 23
his 0 22 23
trip 0 22 23
to 0 22 23
Israel. 0 22 23

Fishback 0 22 24
is 0 22 24
a 0 22 24
BDS 0 22 24
supporter 0 22 24
and 0 22 24
a 0 22 24
member 0 22 24
of 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
JVP 0 22 24
Artists 0 22 24
Council. 0 22 24

His 0 22 25
goal 0 22 25
is 0 22 25
to 0 22 25
“normalize 0 22 25
Jewish 0 22 25
anti-Zionism”. 0 22 25

AJHS 0 22 26
and 0 22 26
JVP 0 22 26
members 0 22 26
get 0 22 26
discounted 0 22 26
admission. 0 22 26

The 0 22 27
venue 0 22 27
is 0 22 27
once 0 22 27
again 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Center 0 22 27
for 0 22 27
Jewish 0 22 27
History. 0 22 27

Specifically 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
Leo 0 22 28
and 0 22 28
Julia 0 22 28
Forchheimer 0 22 28
Auditorium 0 22 28
at 0 22 28
CJH. 0 22 28

Leo 0 22 29
Forchheimer’s 0 22 29
philanthropy 0 22 29
had 0 22 29
left 0 22 29
its 0 22 29
mark 0 22 29
on 0 22 29
Israel. 0 22 29

What 0 22 30
would 0 22 30
he 0 22 30
think 0 22 30
if 0 22 30
he 0 22 30
knew 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
anti-Israel 0 22 30
purposes 0 22 30
that 0 22 30
CJH 0 22 30
is 0 22 30
putting 0 22 30
his 0 22 30
gift 0 22 30
to? 0 22 30

A 0 22 31
third 0 22 31
AJHS-JVP 0 22 31
event 0 22 31
featured 0 22 31
Efrat 0 22 31
Yerday, 0 22 31
an 1 22 31
anti-Israel 1 22 31
activist, 0 22 31
accusing 0 22 31
Israel 0 22 31
of 0 22 31
racism. 0 22 31

Efrat 0 22 32
has 0 22 32
claimed 0 22 32
that, 0 22 32
"Zionism 1 22 32
does 1 22 32
not 1 22 32
only 1 22 32
dispossess 1 22 32
Palestinians, 1 22 32
but 1 22 32
it 1 22 32
also 1 22 32
dispossesses 1 22 32
in 1 22 32
a 1 22 32
very 1 22 32
sophisticated 1 22 32
way, 1 22 32
non-white 1 22 32
Jews. 1 22 32

Being 1 22 33
Jewish 1 22 33
is 1 22 33
highly 1 22 33
identified 1 22 33
with 1 22 33
being 1 22 33
white 1 22 33
because 1 22 33
of 1 22 33
Zionism." 1 22 33

AJHS 0 22 34
will 0 22 34
claim 0 22 34
that 0 22 34
it 0 22 34
is 0 22 34
only 0 22 34
offering 0 22 34
different 0 22 34
perspectives. 0 22 34

But 0 22 35
when 0 22 35
it 0 22 35
comes 0 22 35
to 0 22 35
Israel, 0 22 35
there’s 0 22 35
only 0 22 35
one 0 22 35
perspective. 0 22 35

“Balfour” 0 22 36
and 0 22 36
“Rubble 0 22 36
Rubble” 0 22 36
are 0 22 36
to 0 22 36
be 0 22 36
part 0 22 36
of 0 22 36
AJHS’ 0 22 36
“1917: 0 22 36
How 0 22 36
One 0 22 36
Year 0 22 36
Changed 0 22 36
the 0 22 36
World”. 0 22 36

The 0 22 37
exhibition 0 22 37
is 0 22 37
supposed 0 22 37
to 0 22 37
cover 0 22 37
WWI, 0 22 37
the 0 22 37
Bolshevik 0 22 37
Revolution, 0 22 37
and 0 22 37
the 0 22 37
Balfour 0 22 37
Declaration. 0 22 37

But 0 22 38
the 0 22 38
only 0 22 38
Balfour 0 22 38
program 0 22 38
on 0 22 38
the 0 22 38
list 0 22 38
questions 0 22 38
whether 0 22 38
Israel 0 22 38
should 0 22 38
even 0 22 38
exist. 0 22 38

The 0 22 39
exhibition 0 22 39
closes 0 22 39
with 0 22 39
Fishback’s 0 22 39
anti-Israel 0 22 39
agenda. 0 22 39

And 0 22 40
these 0 22 40
are 0 22 40
the 0 22 40
only 0 22 40
listed 0 22 40
AJHS 0 22 40
programs 0 22 40
that 0 22 40
focus 0 22 40
on 0 22 40
Israel. 0 22 40

JVP 0 22 41
is 0 22 41
also 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
only 0 22 41
organization 0 22 41
that 0 22 41
AJHS 0 22 41
chooses 0 22 41
to 0 22 41
partner 0 22 41
with 0 22 41
on 0 22 41
political 0 22 41
events. 0 22 41

The 0 22 42
American 0 22 42
Jewish 0 22 42
Historical 0 22 42
Society 0 22 42
appears 0 22 42
to 0 22 42
be 0 22 42
uninterested 0 22 42
in 0 22 42
holding 0 22 42
any 0 22 42
pro-Israel 0 22 42
events. 0 22 42

It’s 0 22 43
uninterested 0 22 43
in 0 22 43
partnering 0 22 43
with 0 22 43
pro-Israel 0 22 43
groups. 0 22 43

Instead 0 22 44
it’s 0 22 44
providing 0 22 44
a 0 22 44
forum 0 22 44
for 0 22 44
a 0 22 44
BDS 0 22 44
hate 0 22 44
group. 0 22 44

And 0 22 45
it’s 0 22 45
no 0 22 45
mystery 0 22 45
why. 0 22 45

The 0 22 46
AJHS 0 22 46
Academic 0 22 46
Council 0 22 46
is 0 22 46
packed 0 22 46
with 0 22 46
anti-Israel 0 22 46
activists. 0 22 46

Lila 0 22 47

Berman 0 22 49
has 0 22 49
defended 0 22 49
the 0 22 49
anti-Israel 0 22 49
hate 0 22 49
group 0 22 49
IfNotNow, 0 22 49
which 0 22 49
employs 0 22 49
JVP 0 22 49
tactics, 0 22 49
and 0 22 49
condemned 0 22 49
efforts 0 22 49
to 0 22 49

BDS. 0 22 49

She 0 22 50

of 0 22 50

When 0 22 52
we 0 22 52
look 0 22 52
at 0 22 52
what 0 22 52
is 0 22 52
going 0 22 52
on 0 22 52
in 0 22 52
CJH’s 0 22 52
components 0 22 52
like 0 22 52
the 0 22 52
AJHS, 0 22 52
the 0 22 52
elevation 0 22 52
of 0 22 52
David 0 22 52
N. 0 22 52
Myers 0 22 52
to 0 22 52
head 0 22 52
CJH 0 22 52
is 0 22 52
unsurprising. 0 22 52

Myers 0 22 53
is 0 22 53
a 0 22 53
symptom 0 22 53
of 0 22 53
the 0 22 53
problem. 0 22 53

As 0 22 54
is 0 22 54
AJHS’s 0 22 54
partnership 0 22 54
with 0 22 54
JVP. 0 22 54

A 0 22 55
great 0 22 55
deal 0 22 55
of 0 22 55
shocking 0 22 55
behavior 0 22 55
is 0 22 55
taking 0 22 55
place 0 22 55
inside 0 22 55
Jewish 0 22 55
organizations 0 22 55
whose 0 22 55
inner 0 22 55
workings 0 22 55
most 0 22 55
people 0 22 55
in 0 22 55
the 0 22 55
Jewish 0 22 55
community 0 22 55
generally 0 22 55
pay 0 22 55
very 0 22 55
little 0 22 55
attention 0 22 55
to. 0 22 55

Unlike 0 22 56
CJH, 0 22 56
the 0 22 56
American 0 22 56
Jewish 0 22 56
Historical 0 22 56
Society 0 22 56
is 0 22 56
an 0 22 56
organization 0 22 56
that 0 22 56
dates 0 22 56
back 0 22 56
to 0 22 56
the 0 22 56
19th 0 22 56
century. 0 22 56

Its 1 22 57
perversion 1 22 57
by 0 22 57
the 0 22 57
radical 0 22 57
anti-Jewish 0 22 57
and 0 22 57
anti-Israel 0 22 57
left 0 22 57
to 0 22 57
serve 0 22 57
anti-Semitic 0 22 57
narratives 0 22 57
is 0 22 57
tragic. 0 22 57

And 0 22 58
yet 0 22 58
it’s 0 22 58
inescapable. 0 22 58

Even 0 22 59
as 0 22 59
the 0 22 59
Myers 0 22 59
scandal 0 22 59
continues 0 22 59
to 0 22 59
simmer, 1 22 59
the 0 22 59
AJHS 0 22 59
partnership 0 22 59
with 0 22 59
JVP 0 22 59
is 0 22 59
making 0 22 59
the 0 22 59
choice 0 22 59
painfully 0 22 59
clear. 0 22 59

The 0 22 60
radical 0 22 60
anti-Israel 0 22 60
left 0 22 60
will 0 22 60
not 0 22 60
be 0 22 60
satisfied 0 22 60
with 0 22 60
embedding 0 22 60
“moderate” 0 22 60
opposing 0 22 60
voices 0 22 60
into 0 22 60
Jewish 0 22 60
organizations. 0 22 60

Instead 0 22 61
it 0 22 61
seeks 0 22 61
to 0 22 61
normalize 0 22 61
the 0 22 61
furthest 0 22 61
extremes 0 22 61
of 0 22 61
anti-Israel 0 22 61
hatred. 0 22 61

And 0 22 62
it 0 22 62
will 0 22 62
not 0 22 62
be 0 22 62
satisfied 0 22 62
with 0 22 62
anything 0 22 62
less. 0 22 62

During 0 22 63
the 0 22 63
Myers 0 22 63
controversy, 0 22 63
defenders 0 22 63
of 0 22 63

including 0 22 63
some 0 22 63
figures 0 22 63
named 0 22 63
here, 0 22 63
claimed 0 22 63
that 0 22 63
it 0 22 63
was 0 22 63
an 0 22 63
issue 0 22 63
of 0 22 63
apolitical 0 22 63
scholarship. 0 22 63

Is 0 22 64
co-sponsoring 0 22 64
events 0 22 64
with 0 22 64
a 0 22 64
hate 0 22 64

that 0 22 64
has 0 22 64
sponsored 0 22 64

also 0 22 64

anti-Israel 0 22 65
leftists 0 22 65
at 0 22 65
the 0 22 65

We 1 22 68
all 1 22 68
have 1 22 68
choices 1 22 68
to 1 22 68
make. 1 22 68

Sometimes 0 22 69
the 0 22 69
choices 0 22 69
are 0 22 69
murky. 0 22 69

Other 0 22 70
times 0 22 70
they 0 22 70
are 0 22 70
simple 0 22 70
and 0 22 70
easy. 0 22 70

When 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
American 0 22 71
Jewish 0 22 71
Historical 0 22 71
Society 0 22 71
hosts 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
co-sponsors 0 22 71
an 0 22 71
event 0 22 71
by 0 22 71
a 0 22 71
BDS 0 22 71
hate 0 22 71
group 0 22 71
attacking 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
existence 0 22 71
of 0 22 71
Israel 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
featuring 0 22 71
a 0 22 71
speaker 0 22 71
who 0 22 71
had 0 22 71
defended 0 22 71
terrorism 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
anti-Semitism, 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
choice 0 22 71
becomes 0 22 71
easy. 0 22 71

Either 1 22 72
you 1 22 72
stand 1 22 72
with 1 22 72
BDS, 1 22 72
Hamas, 1 22 72
blood 1 22 72
libels 1 22 72
and 1 22 72
those 1 22 72
who 1 22 72
want 1 22 72
to 1 22 72
destroy 1 22 72
Israel 1 22 72
or 1 22 72
with 1 22 72
Jews. 1 22 72

As 0 22 73
the 0 22 73
anti-Israel 0 22 73
radicalism 0 22 73
of 0 22 73
the 0 22 73
left 0 22 73
grows, 0 22 73
such 0 22 73
choices 0 22 73
will 0 22 73
become 0 22 73
even 0 22 73
more 0 22 73
obscenely 0 22 73
simple. 0 22 73

But 0 22 74
they 0 22 74
will 0 22 74
not 0 22 74
be 0 22 74
any 0 22 74
less 0 22 74
difficult. 0 22 74

Opposing 0 22 75
the 0 22 75
anti-Israel 0 22 75
left 0 22 75
makes 0 22 75
many 0 22 75
important 0 22 75
enemies 0 22 75
and 0 22 75
wins 0 22 75
few 0 22 75
friends. 0 22 75

The 0 22 76
anti-Israel 0 22 76
left 0 22 76
has 0 22 76
built 0 22 76
networks 0 22 76
that 0 22 76
can 0 22 76
blacklist, 0 22 76
smear 0 22 76
and 0 22 76
silence 0 22 76
almost 0 22 76
anyone 0 22 76
in 0 22 76
an 0 22 76
academic 0 22 76
field. 0 22 76

Speaking 0 22 77
out 0 22 77
against 0 22 77
hate 0 22 77
is 0 22 77
easiest 0 22 77
when 0 22 77
it’s 0 22 77
weakest. 0 22 77

It’s 0 22 78
hardest 0 22 78
when 0 22 78
it’s 0 22 78
strongest. 0 22 78

When 0 22 79
we 0 22 79
think 0 22 79
about 0 22 79
Nazi 0 22 79
Germany, 0 22 79
we 0 22 79
remember 0 22 79
those 0 22 79
who 0 22 79
spoke 0 22 79
out. 0 22 79

We 0 22 80
don’t 0 22 80
remember 0 22 80
those 0 22 80
who 0 22 80
were 0 22 80
too 0 22 80
intimidated 0 22 80
and 0 22 80
uncertain 0 22 80
to 0 22 80
rise 0 22 80
against 0 22 80
anti-Semitism 0 22 80
when 0 22 80
they 0 22 80
saw 0 22 80
it 0 22 80
and 0 22 80
heard 0 22 80
it. 0 22 80

History 0 22 81
tells 0 22 81
us 0 22 81
why 0 22 81
so 0 22 81
many 0 22 81
people 0 22 81
are 0 22 81
afraid 0 22 81
to 0 22 81
do 0 22 81
the 0 22 81
right 0 22 81
thing 0 22 81
when 0 22 81
it 0 22 81
counts. 0 22 81

It 0 22 82
also 0 22 82
tells 0 22 82
us 0 22 82
how 0 22 82

as 0 24 4
highlighted 0 24 4
by 0 24 4
The 0 24 4
Daily 0 24 4
Sheeple, 0 24 4
the 0 24 4
security 0 24 4

was 0 24 4
hailed 0 24 4
as 0 24 4
being 0 24 4
responsible 0 24 4
for 0 24 4
preventing 0 24 4
the 0 24 4
shooter 0 24 4
from 0 24 4
continuing 0 24 4

out, 0 24 5
security 0 24 5
guard 0 24 5
Jesus 0 24 5
Campos 0 24 5
was 0 24 5
actually 0 24 5
shot 0 24 5
BEFORE 0 24 5

As 0 24 6
part 0 24 6
of 0 24 6
the 0 24 6
constantly 1 24 6
changing 1 24 6
story, 1 24 6
officials 0 24 6
are 0 24 6
now 0 24 6

to 0 24 6

know 0 24 6
a 0 24 6
hotel 0 24 6
security 0 24 6
guard 0 24 6
had 0 24 6
been 0 24 6
shot 0 24 6
“until 0 24 6
they 0 24 6
met 0 24 6
him 0 24 6
in 0 24 6

after 0 24 6
exiting 0 24 6
the 0 24 6

Lombardo 0 24 6
said. 0 24 6

The 0 24 7
security 0 24 7
guard, 0 24 7
Jesus 0 24 7
Campos, 0 24 7
was 0 24 7
struck 0 24 7
in 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
leg 0 24 7
as 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
gunman, 0 24 7
from 0 24 7
behind 0 24 7
his 0 24 7

on 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
32nd 0 24 7

Paddock 0 24 8
apparently 0 24 8
detected 0 24 8
Campos 0 24 8
via 0 24 8
surveillance 0 24 8
cameras 0 24 8
he 0 24 8
set 0 24 8

outside 0 24 8
his 0 24 8
hotel 0 24 8

police 0 24 8
have 0 24 8
said. 0 24 8

Paddock 0 24 9
shot 0 24 9
the 0 24 9

at 0 24 9
9:59 0 24 9
p.m. 0 24 9
local 0 24 9
time, 0 24 9
Lombardo 0 24 9
said, 0 24 9
shortly 0 24 9
before 0 24 9
raining 0 24 9
down 0 24 9

on 0 24 9

at 0 24 9
10:05 0 24 9
p.m. 0 24 9

lasted 0 24 9

when 0 24 10
they 0 24 10
arrived 0 24 10
on 0 24 10
the 0 24 10
floor. 0 24 10

And 0 24 11
Campos 0 24 11
did 0 24 11
not 0 24 11
summon 0 24 11
police 0 24 11
to 0 24 11

What’s 0 24 12
also 0 24 12
incredibly 0 24 12
interesting, 0 24 12
is 0 24 12
that 0 24 12

Moreover, 0 24 20
did 0 24 20
he 0 24 20
stop 0 24 20

Or 0 24 21
is 0 24 21
it 0 24 21
possible 0 24 21
that 0 24 21
Paddock 0 24 21

effectively 1 30 23
exclude 1 30 23
all 1 30 23

then 1 30 23
they 1 30 23

Let's 0 30 24
unpack 0 30 24
this 0 30 24
knapsack 1 30 24
of 1 30 24
entitled 1 30 24
nonsense. 1 30 24

Anti-Israel 0 30 25
activists 0 30 25
like 0 30 25
Dan 0 30 25
Fishback 0 30 25
are 0 30 25
entitled 0 30 25
to 0 30 25
exploit 0 30 25
Jewish 0 30 25
spaces 0 30 25
for 0 30 25
their 0 30 25
propoaganda... 0 30 25
even 0 30 25
while 0 30 25
they 0 30 25
advocate 0 30 25

some 0 30 26
Israeli 0 30 26

Now 0 30 27
he's 0 30 27
whining 1 30 27
that 0 30 27
boycotting 0 30 27
his 0 30 27
play 0 30 27
is 0 30 27
a 0 30 27
violation 0 30 27
of 0 30 27
Jewishness 0 30 27
because 0 30 27
Jews 0 30 27
are 0 30 27
a 0 30 27
"people 0 30 27
of 0 30 27
dissent 0 30 27
and 0 30 27
argument." 0 30 27

But 0 30 28
the 0 30 28
only 0 30 28
dissent 0 30 28
and 0 30 28
argument 0 30 28
that 0 30 28
Jews 0 30 28
are 0 30 28
supposed 0 30 28
to 0 30 28

that 0 30 28

the 1 30 28
existence 1 30 28
of 1 30 28
Jewish 1 30 28
nationhood. 1 30 28

Not 1 30 29

nationhood 1 30 29
itself. 1 30 29

"it’s 0 30 30

reporters 0 31 1
Laura 0 31 1

barred 0 31 1
from 0 31 1
entering 0 31 1
the 0 31 1

They 0 31 2
would 0 31 2
have 0 31 2
posed 0 31 2
real 0 31 2
genuine 0 31 2
questions 0 31 2
of 0 31 2
Sheriff 0 31 2

being 0 31 3

Are 1 31 4

they 0 31 5
have 0 31 5
no 0 31 5
explanation 0 31 5

Do 1 31 6
the 1 31 6
FBI 1 31 6
and 1 31 6
law 1 31 6

think 1 31 6
people 1 31 6
won’t 1 31 6
talk 1 31 6
about 1 31 6
it 1 31 6

to 1 31 6
what 1 31 6
happened? 1 31 6

Are 1 31 7
they 1 31 7
for 1 31 7
real? 1 31 7

Further, 1 31 8
the 1 31 8
FBI 1 31 8
insists 1 31 8
there 1 31 8
is 1 31 8
no 1 31 8

they 1 31 8
don’t 1 31 8

How 0 31 9
can 0 31 9
they 0 31 9

on 0 31 13
some 0 31 13
details. 0 31 13

I 0 31 14
realize 0 31 14
that 0 31 14
in 0 31 14
the 0 31 14
heat 0 31 14
of 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
shooting, 0 31 14
particularly 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
mass 0 31 14
shooting, 0 31 14
it 0 31 14
may 0 31 14
take 0 31 14
some 0 31 14
time 0 31 14
for 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
precise 0 31 14
timeline 0 31 14
to 0 31 14
develop. 0 31 14

But 0 31 15
it 0 31 15
didn’t 0 31 15
take 0 31 15
very 0 31 15
long 0 31 15
for 0 31 15
the 0 31 15

to 0 31 15
release 0 31 15
a 0 31 15
precise 0 31 15
timeline. 0 31 15

The 0 31 16
initial 0 31 16
timeline 0 31 16
was 0 31 16
that 0 31 16
Stephen 0 31 16
Paddock’s 0 31 16
shooting 0 31 16
stopped 0 31 16
when, 0 31 16
approximately 0 31 16
6 0 31 16
minutes 0 31 16
after 0 31 16
he 0 31 16
started, 0 31 16
he 0 31 16
was 0 31 16
interrupted 0 31 16
by 0 31 16
a 0 31 16

from 0 31 16
the 0 31 16
Mandalay 0 31 16

Paddock 0 31 17
then 0 31 17
turned 0 31 17
his 0 31 17
fire 0 31 17
into 0 31 17
the 0 31 17
hallway, 0 31 17
firing 0 31 17
some 0 31 17
200 0 31 17
bullets, 0 31 17
and 0 31 17
after 0 31 17
that 0 31 17
the 0 31 17
shooting 0 31 17
stopped 0 31 17
as 0 31 17

later, 0 31 20
the 0 31 20
Las 0 31 20
Vegas 0 31 20
police 0 31 20
backed 0 31 20
away 0 31 20
from 0 31 20
that 0 31 20
timeline, 0 31 20
and 0 31 20
stated 0 31 20
that 0 31 20
the 0 31 20
security 0 31 20
guard 0 31 20
actually 0 31 20
arrived 0 31 20
6 0 31 20
minutes 0 31 20
before 0 31 20
Paddock 0 31 20
started 0 31 20

32 0 31 20
stories 0 31 20
below 0 31 20
him. 0 31 20

That 1 31 21
raised 1 31 21
a 1 31 21
number 1 31 21
of 1 31 21
question, 1 31 21
including 0 31 21
why 0 31 21
no 0 31 21
one 0 31 21
called 0 31 21

after 0 31 21
what 0 31 21
must 0 31 21
have 0 31 21
been 0 31 21
a 0 31 21
loud 0 31 21

that 0 31 27
the 0 31 27

who 0 31 27

his 0 31 27

not 0 31 27
shoot 0 31 27
a 0 31 27

six 0 31 27

that 0 31 27

they 1 31 27
had 1 31 27

earlier 1 31 27
this 1 31 27

The 0 31 28
confusion 0 31 28
began 0 31 28
Monday 0 31 28
when 0 31 28
police 0 31 28
said 0 31 28
that 0 31 28
the 0 31 28

six 0 31 28
minutes 0 31 28
before 0 31 28
the 0 31 28
mass 0 31 28
shooting 0 31 28

not 0 31 28
during 0 31 28
the 0 31 28
massacre 0 31 28
as 0 31 28
they 0 31 28
had 0 31 28
said. 0 31 28

Lombardo 0 31 29
also 0 31 29
said 0 31 29
police 0 31 29
had 0 31 29
hunted 0 31 29
for 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
source 0 31 29
of 0 31 29

that 0 31 29

responding 0 31 29
to 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
gunman’s 0 31 29

were 0 31 29
unaware 0 31 29
that 0 31 29
a 0 31 29
guard 0 31 29
was 0 31 29
shot 0 31 29
until 0 31 29
they 0 31 29
arrived 0 31 29
there, 0 31 29
at 0 31 29
which 0 31 29
point 0 31 29
the 0 31 29
shooting 0 31 29
rampage 0 31 29
had 0 31 29
ended. 0 31 29

MGM 0 31 30

pushed 0 31 30
back 0 31 30
on 0 31 30
this 0 31 30
account, 0 31 30
first 0 31 30
saying 0 31 30
Tuesday 0 31 30
that 0 31 30
there 0 31 30
were 0 31 30
unspecified 0 31 30
inaccuracies 0 31 30
and 0 31 30
then, 0 31 30
on 0 31 30
Thursday, 0 31 30
releasing 0 31 30
a 0 31 30
statement 0 31 30
directly 0 31 30
contradicting 0 31 30
parts 0 31 30
of 0 31 30
what 0 31 30
the 0 31 30
police 0 31 30
had 0 31 30
said…. 0 31 30

Lombardo 0 31 31
had 0 31 31
said 0 31 31
Monday 0 31 31
that 0 31 31
Campos, 0 31 31
the 0 31 31
guard, 0 31 31
was 0 31 31
shot 0 31 31
at 0 31 31
9:59 0 31 31
p.m. 0 31 31
and 0 31 31
that 0 31 31
the 0 31 31
mass 0 31 31
shooting 0 31 31
began 0 31 31
at 0 31 31
10:05 0 31 31
p.m. 0 31 31

This 0 31 32
six-minute 0 31 32
gap 0 31 32
relayed 0 31 32
by 0 31 32
Lombardo 0 31 32
left 0 31 32
uncertain 0 31 32
whether 0 31 32
there 0 31 32
was 0 31 32
any 0 31 32
lag 0 31 32
in 0 31 32
alerting 0 31 32
police 0 31 32
to 0 31 32
the 0 31 32
source 0 31 32
of 0 31 32
the 0 31 32
gunfire 0 31 32
during 0 31 32
critical 0 31 32
moments. 0 31 32

Police 0 31 33
said 0 31 33
officers 0 31 33
arrived 0 31 33
on 0 31 33
the 0 31 33
32nd 0 31 33
floor 0 31 33
at 0 31 33
10:17 0 31 33
p.m., 0 31 33
two 0 31 33
minutes 0 31 33
after 0 31 33
Paddock 0 31 33
had 0 31 33
stopped 0 31 33
firing. 0 31 33

MGM, 0 31 34
though, 0 31 34
said 0 31 34
it 0 31 34
was 0 31 34
“confident” 0 31 34
that 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
9:59 0 31 34
p.m. 0 31 34
time 0 31 34
was 0 31 34
inaccurate 0 31 34
and 0 31 34
“was 0 31 34
derived 0 31 34
from 0 31 34
a 0 31 34

the 0 31 34
fact 0 31 34
without 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
benefit 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
information 0 31 34
we 0 31 34
now 0 31 34
have.” 0 31 34
The 0 31 34
company 0 31 34
also 0 31 34
disputed 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
suggestion 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
lag, 0 31 34
saying 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
shooting 0 31 34
rampage 0 31 34
began 0 31 34
within 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
minute 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
Campos 0 31 34
reporting 0 31 34
his 0 31 34
injury 0 31 34
on 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
32nd 0 31 34
floor. 0 31 34

On 0 31 35
Friday, 0 31 35
Lombardo 0 31 35
effectively 0 31 35
agreed 0 31 35
with 0 31 35
the 0 31 35
company’s 0 31 35
statement, 0 31 35
though 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
argued 0 31 35
that 0 31 35
the 0 31 35
9:59 0 31 35
p.m. 0 31 35
time 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
had 0 31 35
offered 0 31 35
four 0 31 35
days 0 31 35
earlier 0 31 35
“wasn’t 0 31 35
inaccurate 0 31 35
when 0 31 35
I 0 31 35
provided 0 31 35
it.” 0 31 35
Lombardo 0 31 35
said 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
was 0 31 35
told 0 31 35
this 0 31 35
time 0 31 35
had 0 31 35
been 0 31 35

Upon 0 31 36

that 0 31 36

a 0 31 36

at 0 31 36
9:59 0 31 36
p.m. 0 31 36

The 0 31 37
guard 0 31 37
was 0 31 37
eventually 0 31 37
fired 0 31 37
upon 0 31 37
by 0 31 37
Paddock 0 31 37
“in 0 31 37

Clear, 0 31 38
right? 0 31 38

Not 0 31 39
so 0 31 39
fast, 0 31 39
the 0 31 39
police 0 31 39
and 0 31 39

over 0 31 39

such 0 31 39
as 0 31 39
when 0 31 39

arrived 0 31 39
relative 0 31 39
to 0 31 39
Paddock’s 0 31 39
shooting 0 31 39
at 0 31 39
the 0 31 39
crowd: 0 31 39
An 0 31 39
enormous, 0 31 39
important 0 31 39
discrepancy 0 31 39
has 0 31 39
emerged 0 31 39
over 0 31 39
what 0 31 39
happened 0 31 39
during 0 31 39
the 0 31 39

arrive 0 31 39
on 0 31 39

32nd 0 31 39
floor 0 31 39
where 0 31 39
Stephen 0 31 39

was 0 31 39
firing 0 31 39
his 0 31 39
deadly 0 31 39
fusillade 0 31 39
onto 0 31 39
concertgoers 0 31 39
below? 0 31 39

Las 0 31 40
Vegas 0 31 40
police 0 31 40
say 0 31 40
they 0 31 40
didn’t 0 31 40
get 0 31 40
to 0 31 40
the 0 31 40
floor 0 31 40
until 0 31 40
after 0 31 40
the 0 31 40
shooting 0 31 40
was 0 31 40
over. 0 31 40

But 0 31 41

the 0 31 41
owner 0 31 41

says 0 31 41
police 0 31 41
officers 0 31 41
were 0 31 41
there 0 31 41
shortly 0 31 41
after 0 31 41
the 0 31 41

began, 0 31 41
responding 0 31 41

being 0 31 41
shot. 0 31 41

The 0 31 42
discrepancy 0 31 42
could 0 31 42
raise 0 31 42
questions 0 31 42
about 0 31 42
whether 0 31 42

and 0 31 43
“immediately 0 31 43

MGM 0 31 43
said 0 31 43
that 0 31 43
“Metro 0 31 43

The 0 31 44
statement 0 31 44
says 0 31 44
MGM 0 31 44
believes 0 31 44
Paddock 0 31 44
began 0 31 44

out 0 31 44
the 0 31 44

of 0 31 44

reporting 0 31 44
his 0 31 44

“I 0 31 44
agree 0 31 44

These 1 31 44
discrepancies 1 31 44
on 1 31 44

are 1 31 44
feeding 1 31 44

As 0 31 45
to 0 31 45

still 0 31 45
nothing 0 31 45

By 0 34 1
now, 0 34 1
we 0 34 1
have 0 34 1
all 0 34 1
heard 0 34 1
of 0 34 1
Jesus 0 34 1
Campos. 0 34 1

He’s 0 34 2
the 0 34 2
heroic 0 34 2
security 0 34 2
guard 0 34 2
that 0 34 2
allegedly 0 34 2
located 0 34 2
the 0 34 2
Las 0 34 2
Vegas 0 34 2
shooter, 0 34 2
Steven 0 34 2
Paddock. 0 34 2

But 0 34 3
the 0 34 3
narrative 0 34 3
surrounding 0 34 3
him 0 34 3
has 0 34 3
changed 0 34 3
wildly 0 34 3
since 0 34 3
the 0 34 3
authorities 0 34 3
mentioned 0 34 3
him, 0 34 3
and 0 34 3
now, 0 34 3
he’s 0 34 3
mysteriously 1 34 3
vanished 1 34 3
into 1 34 3
thin 1 34 3
air. 1 34 3

Of 0 34 4
course, 0 34 4
this 0 34 4
leads 0 34 4
many 0 34 4
to 0 34 4
believe 0 34 4
that 0 34 4
Campos 0 34 4
didn’t 0 34 4
even 0 34 4
exist, 0 34 4
to 0 34 4
begin 0 34 4
with. 0 34 4

His 1 34 5
mere 1 34 5
existence 1 34 5
appears 1 34 5
to 1 34 5
have 1 34 5
been 1 34 5
fabricated 1 34 5
by 1 34 5
the 1 34 5
very 1 34 5
authorities 1 34 5
who 1 34 5
are 1 34 5
cramming 1 34 5
lies 1 34 5
down 1 34 5
our 1 34 5
throats 1 34 5
about 1 34 5
this 1 34 5
massacre 1 34 5
for 1 34 5
the 1 34 5
sake 1 34 5
of 1 34 5
political 1 34 5
agendas. 1 34 5

There 0 34 6
are 0 34 6
two 0 34 6
conflicting 0 34 6
timelines 0 34 6
of 0 34 6
Campos’s 0 34 6
injury, 0 34 6
but 0 34 6
what 0 34 6
the 0 34 6
media 0 34 6
has 0 34 6
so 0 34 6
far 0 34 6
made 0 34 6
clear, 0 34 6
is 0 34 6
that 0 34 6
they 1 34 6
want 1 34 6
the 1 34 6
public 1 34 6
to 1 34 6
believe 1 34 6
Campos 0 34 6
was 0 34 6
walking 0 34 6
down 0 34 6
the 0 34 6
Mandalay 0 34 6
Bay 0 34 6
Hotel 0 34 6
& 0 34 6
Casino’s 0 34 6
32nd 0 34 6
floor 0 34 6
hallway, 0 34 6
when 0 34 6
Stephen 0 34 6
Paddock 0 34 6
spotted 0 34 6
him 0 34 6
on 0 34 6
a 0 34 6
camera 0 34 6
he’d 0 34 6
allegedly 0 34 6
set 0 34 6
up 0 34 6
in 0 34 6
a 0 34 6
room 0 34 6
service 0 34 6
cart, 0 34 6
just 0 34 6
outside 0 34 6
his 0 34 6
suite. 0 34 6

Once 0 34 7
he 0 34 7
saw 0 34 7
Campos, 0 34 7
Paddock 0 34 7
reportedly 0 34 7
fired 0 34 7
nearly 0 34 7
200 0 34 7
rounds 0 34 7
through 0 34 7
his 0 34 7
suite 0 34 7
door, 0 34 7
wounding 0 34 7
Campos 0 34 7
in 0 34 7
the 0 34 7
leg. 0 34 7

Moments 0 34 8
later 0 34 8
(6 0 34 8
minutes 0 34 8
actually, 0 34 8
according 0 34 8
to 0 34 8
the 0 34 8
newly 0 34 8
revised 0 34 8
timeline 0 34 8
regarding 0 34 8
Campos) 0 34 8
Paddock 0 34 8
allegedly 0 34 8
opened 0 34 8
fire 0 34 8
on 0 34 8
a 0 34 8
crowd 0 34 8
killing 0 34 8
more 0 34 8
than 0 34 8
50 0 34 8
and 0 34 8
injuring 0 34 8
nearly 0 34 8
500. 0 34 8

But 0 34 9
Campos 0 34 9
has 0 34 9
been 0 34 9
a 0 34 9
mysterious 0 34 9
subject 0 34 9
since 0 34 9
being 0 34 9
wounded 0 34 9
in 0 34 9
the 0 34 9
first 0 34 9
moments 0 34 9
of 0 34 9
Paddock’s 0 34 9
assault. 0 34 9

After 0 34 10
speaking 0 34 10
to 0 34 10

and 0 34 10
law 0 34 10

just 0 34 10
moments 0 34 10
before 0 34 10

a 0 34 11

none 0 34 12

filled 0 34 12
out 0 34 12
an 0 34 12

request 0 34 12
for 0 34 12
a 0 34 12

by 0 34 12
that 0 34 12

and 0 34 12
Campos 0 34 12
has 0 34 12
been 0 34 12
silent 0 34 12
since 0 34 12
the 0 34 12
text; 0 34 12
vanishing 1 34 12
into 1 34 12

He 0 34 13
also 0 34 13
isn’t 0 34 13

“Right 0 34 14
now 0 34 14
I’m 0 34 14
just 0 34 14
concerned 0 34 14
where 0 34 14
my 0 34 14

is, 0 34 14
and 0 34 14
what 0 34 14
his 0 34 14
condition 0 34 14
is. 0 34 14

It’s 0 34 15
highly 0 34 15
unusual,” 0 34 15
Hickey 0 34 15
told 0 34 15

“I’m 0 34 16

everything 0 34 16
is 0 34 16
OK 0 34 16

I’m 0 34 16
sure 0 34 16
MGM 0 34 16

In 0 34 17
the 0 34 17

Iran. 0 35 2

No, 0 35 3
in 0 35 3
his 0 35 3
speech 0 35 3
decertifying 0 35 3
Iran’s 0 35 3
compliance 0 35 3
with 0 35 3
the 0 35 3
nuclear 0 35 3
accord 0 35 3
it 0 35 3
struck 0 35 3
with 0 35 3
his 0 35 3
predecessor 0 35 3
Barack 0 35 3
Obama, 0 35 3
Trump 0 35 3
didn’t 0 35 3
announce 0 35 3
a 0 35 3
new 0 35 3
strategy 0 35 3
for 0 35 3
preventing 0 35 3
Iran 0 35 3
from 0 35 3
acquiring 0 35 3
nuclear 0 35 3
weapons, 0 35 3
or 0 35 3
stemming 0 35 3
its 0 35 3
hegemonic 0 35 3
rise 0 35 3
in 0 35 3
the 0 35 3
Middle 0 35 3
East, 0 35 3
or 0 35 3
limiting 0 35 3
its 0 35 3
ability 0 35 3
to 0 35 3
sponsor 0 35 3
terrorism. 0 35 3

Trump’s 0 35 4
move 0 35 4
was 0 35 4
not 0 35 4
operational. 0 35 4

It 0 35 5
was 0 35 5
directional. 0 35 5

In 0 35 6
his 0 35 6
address 0 35 6
Friday, 0 35 6
Trump 0 35 6
changed 0 35 6
the 0 35 6
policy 0 35 6
dynamics 0 35 6
that 0 35 6
dictate 0 35 6
US 0 35 6
policy 0 35 6
on 0 35 6
Iran. 0 35 6

For 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
first 0 35 7
time 0 35 7
since 0 35 7
2009, 0 35 7
when 0 35 7
Obama 0 35 7
backed 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
murderous 1 35 7
regime 1 35 7
in 0 35 7
Tehran, 0 35 7
spurning 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
millions 0 35 7
of 0 35 7
Iranians 0 35 7
who 0 35 7
rose 0 35 7
up 0 35 7
in 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
Green 0 35 7
Revolution, 0 35 7
Trump 0 35 7
opened 0 35 7
up 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
possibility 0 35 7
that 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
US 0 35 7
may 0 35 7
begin 0 35 7
to 0 35 7
base 0 35 7
its 0 35 7
policies 0 35 7
toward 0 35 7
Iran 0 35 7
on 0 35 7
reality. 0 35 7

Trump 0 35 8
began 0 35 8
his 0 35 8
remarks 0 35 8
by 0 35 8
setting 0 35 8
out 0 35 8
Iran’s 1 35 8
long 1 35 8
rap 1 35 8
sheet 1 35 8
of 1 35 8
aggression 1 35 8
against 1 35 8
America. 1 35 8

Starting 0 35 9
with 0 35 9
the 0 35 9
US 0 35 9
embassy 0 35 9
seizure 1 35 9
and 1 35 9
hostage 1 35 9
crisis, 1 35 9
Trump 1 35 9
described 1 35 9
Iran’s 1 35 9
crimes 1 35 9
and 1 35 9
acts 1 35 9
of 1 35 9
war 1 35 9
against 1 35 9
America 1 35 9
in 0 35 9
greater 0 35 9
detail 0 35 9
than 0 35 9
any 0 35 9
of 0 35 9
his 0 35 9
predecessors 0 35 9
ever 0 35 9

did. 0 35 10
Trump’s 0 35 10
dossier 0 35 10
was 0 35 10
interlaced 0 35 10
with 0 35 10
condemnations 0 35 10
of 0 35 10
the 0 35 10
regime’s 0 35 10
repression 0 35 10
of 0 35 10
its 0 35 10
own 0 35 10
people. 0 35 10

By 0 35 11
merging 0 35 11
Iran’s 0 35 11
external 0 35 11
aggression 0 35 11
with 0 35 11
its 0 35 11
internal 0 35 11
repression, 0 35 11
Trump 0 35 11
signaled 0 35 11
a 0 35 11
readiness 0 35 11
to 0 35 11
drive 0 35 11
a 0 35 11
wedge 0 35 11
– 0 35 11
or 0 35 11
expand 0 35 11
the 0 35 11
wedge 0 35 11
– 0 35 11
between 0 35 11
the 1 35 11
authoritarian 1 35 11
theocrats 1 35 11
that 0 35 11
rule 0 35 11
Iran 0 35 11
and 0 35 11
the 0 35 11
largely 0 35 11
secular, 0 35 11
multiethnic 0 35 11
and 0 35 11
pro-Western 0 35 11
people 0 35 11
of 0 35 11

Iran. 0 35 12
Trump 0 35 12
then 0 35 12
turned 0 35 12
his 0 35 12
attention 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
Iran’s 0 35 12
illicit 0 35 12
ballistic 0 35 12
missile 0 35 12
program, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
sponsorship 1 35 12
of 1 35 12
terrorism, 1 35 12
including 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
links 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
al-Qaida, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
aggression 0 35 12
against 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
neighbors, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
aggressive 0 35 12
acts 0 35 12
against 0 35 12
maritime 0 35 12
traffic 0 35 12
in 0 35 12
the 0 35 12
Straits 0 35 12
of 0 35 12
Hormuz, 0 35 12
and 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
bids 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
destabilize 0 35 12
and 0 35 12
control 0 35 12
large 0 35 12
swaths 0 35 12
of 0 35 12
the 0 35 12
Middle 0 35 12
East 0 35 12
through 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
proxies. 0 35 12

It 0 35 13
is 0 35 13
notable 0 35 13
that 0 35 13
these 0 35 13
remarks 0 35 13
preceded 0 35 13
Trump’s 0 35 13
discussion 0 35 13
of 0 35 13
the 0 35 13
nuclear 0 35 13
deal 0 35 13
– 0 35 13
which 0 35 13
was 0 35 13
the 0 35 13
ostensible 0 35 13
subject 0 35 13
of 0 35 13
his 0 35 13

speech. 0 35 14
Before 0 35 14
Trump 0 35 14
discussed 0 35 14
Iran’s 0 35 14
breaches 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
nuclear 0 35 14
deal, 0 35 14
he 0 35 14
first 0 35 14
demonstrated 0 35 14
that 0 35 14
contrary 0 35 14
to 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
expressed 0 35 14
views 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
his 0 35 14
top 0 35 14
advisers, 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
is 0 35 14
impossible 0 35 14
to 0 35 14
limit 0 35 14
a 0 35 14
realistic 0 35 14
discussion 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
the 1 35 14
threat 1 35 14
Iran 1 35 14
constitutes 1 35 14
to 1 35 14
US 1 35 14
national 1 35 14
security 1 35 14
and 1 35 14
interests 1 35 14
to 0 35 14
whether 0 35 14
or 0 35 14
not 0 35 14
and 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
what 0 35 14
manner 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
is 0 35 14
breaching 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
nuclear 0 35 14

accord. 0 35 15
This 0 35 15
was 0 35 15
a 0 35 15
critical 0 35 15
point 0 35 15
because 0 35 15
for 0 35 15
the 0 35 15
past 0 35 15
two 0 35 15
years, 0 35 15
US 0 35 15
discourse 0 35 15
on 0 35 15
Iran 0 35 15
has 0 35 15
focused 0 35 15
solely 0 35 15
on 0 35 15
whether 0 35 15
or 0 35 15
not 0 35 15
Iran 0 35 15
was 0 35 15
complying 0 35 15
with 0 35 15
Obama’s 0 35 15
nuclear 0 35 15

pact. 0 35 16
By 0 35 16
placing 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
nuclear 0 35 16
deal 0 35 16
in 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
context 0 35 16
of 0 35 16
Iran’s 0 35 16
consistent, 0 35 16
overarching 1 35 16
hostility 1 35 16
and 1 35 16
aggression, 1 35 16
Trump 0 35 16
made 0 35 16
it 0 35 16
self-evident 0 35 16
that 0 35 16
no 0 35 16
US 0 35 16
interest 0 35 16
is 0 35 16
served 0 35 16
in 0 35 16
continuing 0 35 16
to 0 35 16
give 0 35 16
Iran 0 35 16
a 0 35 16
free 0 35 16
pass 0 35 16
from 0 35 16
congressional 0 35 16
sanctions. 0 35 16

After 0 35 17
accomplishing 0 35 17
that 0 35 17
goal, 0 35 17
Trump 0 35 17
turned 0 35 17
his 0 35 17
attention 0 35 17
to 0 35 17
how 0 35 17
Iran 0 35 17
is 0 35 17
actually 0 35 17
breaching 0 35 17
the 0 35 17
letter 0 35 17
and 0 35 17
spirit 0 35 17
of 0 35 17
the 0 35 17
nuclear 0 35 17

pact. 0 35 18
Only 0 35 18
then, 0 35 18
almost 0 35 18
as 0 35 18
an 0 35 18
afterthought, 0 35 18
did 0 35 18
he 0 35 18
announce 0 35 18
that 0 35 18
he 0 35 18
was 0 35 18
decertifying 0 35 18
Iranian 0 35 18
compliance 0 35 18
with 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
nuclear 0 35 18
deal, 0 35 18
setting 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
conditions 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
renewal 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
congressional 0 35 18
sanctions 0 35 18
on 0 35 18
Iran 0 35 18
and 0 35 18
opening 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
floodgates 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
congressional 0 35 18
sanctions 0 35 18
on 0 35 18
Iran 0 35 18
in 0 35 18
retaliation 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
full 0 35 18
spectrum 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
its 0 35 18
aggressive 1 35 18
and 1 35 18
illicit 1 35 18
acts 1 35 18
against 1 35 18
the 1 35 18
US, 1 35 18
its 1 35 18
interests 1 35 18
and 1 35 18

allies. 1 35 19
By 0 35 19
empowering 0 35 19
Congress 0 35 19
to 0 35 19
prohibit 0 35 19
economic 0 35 19
cooperation 0 35 19
with 0 35 19
Iran, 0 35 19
Trump 0 35 19
put 0 35 19
the 0 35 19
Europeans, 0 35 19
Chinese 0 35 19
and 0 35 19
Russians 0 35 19
on 0 35 19
notice 0 35 19
that 0 35 19
they 0 35 19
may 0 35 19
soon 0 35 19
face 0 35 19
a 0 35 19
choice 0 35 19
between 0 35 19
conducting 0 35 19
business 0 35 19
with 0 35 19
the 0 35 19
US 0 35 19
and 0 35 19
conducting 0 35 19
business 0 35 19

with 0 35 20
Iran. 0 35 20
After 0 35 20
putting 0 35 20
them 0 35 20
on 0 35 20
notice, 0 35 20
Trump 0 35 20
discussed 0 35 20
the 0 35 20
possibility 0 35 20
of 0 35 20
improving 0 35 20
Obama’s 0 35 20
nuclear 0 35 20

accord. 0 35 21
Among 0 35 21
other 0 35 21
things, 0 35 21
he 0 35 21
suggested 0 35 21
expanding 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
inspection 0 35 21
regime 0 35 21
against 0 35 21
Iran’s 0 35 21
nuclear 0 35 21
installations 0 35 21
and 0 35 21
canceling 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
so-called 0 35 21
“sunset” 0 35 21
clause 0 35 21
that 0 35 21
places 0 35 21
an 0 35 21
end 0 35 21
date 0 35 21
on 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
restrictions 0 35 21
governing 0 35 21
certain 0 35 21
components 0 35 21
of 0 35 21
Iran’s 0 35 21
nuclear 0 35 21

advancement. 0 35 22
Trump’s 0 35 22
address 0 35 22
has 0 35 22
the 0 35 22
potential 0 35 22
to 0 35 22
serve 0 35 22
as 0 35 22
the 0 35 22
foundation 0 35 22
of 0 35 22
a 0 35 22
major, 0 35 22
positive 0 35 22
shift 0 35 22
in 0 35 22
US 0 35 22
policy 0 35 22

toward 0 35 23
Iran. 0 35 23
Such 0 35 23
a 0 35 23
shift 0 35 23
could 0 35 23
potentially 0 35 23
facilitate 0 35 23
the 0 35 23
achievement 0 35 23
of 0 35 23
Trump’s 0 35 23
goals 0 35 23
of 0 35 23
preventing 0 35 23
Iran 0 35 23
from 0 35 23
acquiring 0 35 23
nuclear 0 35 23
weapons, 0 35 23
containing 0 35 23
its 0 35 23
regional 0 35 23
aggression 0 35 23
and 0 35 23
empowerment 0 35 23
and 0 35 23
defeating 0 35 23
its 0 35 23
terrorist 0 35 23

proxies. 0 35 24
Unfortunately, 1 35 24
it 1 35 24
is 1 35 24
also 1 35 24
likely, 1 35 24
indeed, 1 35 24
it 1 35 24
is 1 35 24
more 1 35 24
likely, 1 35 24
that 1 35 24
his 1 35 24
words 1 35 24
will 1 35 24
not 1 35 24
be 1 35 24
translated 1 35 24
into 1 35 24
policies 1 35 24
to 1 35 24
achieve 1 35 24
these 1 35 24

critical 1 35 25
aims. 1 35 25
Trump’s 0 35 25
decision 0 35 25
to 0 35 25
transfer 0 35 25
immediate 0 35 25
responsibility 0 35 25
to 0 35 25
Congress 0 35 25
for 0 35 25
holding 0 35 25
Iran 0 35 25
accountable 0 35 25
for 0 35 25
its 0 35 25
hostile 0 35 25
actions 0 35 25
on 0 35 25
the 0 35 25
military 0 35 25
and 0 35 25
other 0 35 25
fronts 0 35 25
is 0 35 25

a 0 35 26
risky 0 35 26
move. 0 35 26
He 0 35 26
has 0 35 26
a 0 35 26
lot 0 35 26
of 0 35 26
enemies, 0 35 26
and 0 35 26
the 0 35 26
nuclear 0 35 26
deal 0 35 26
has 0 35 26
a 0 35 26
lot 0 35 26
of 0 35 26
supporters 0 35 26
on 0 35 26

Capitol 0 35 27
Hill. 0 35 27
Obama 0 35 27
would 0 35 27
have 0 35 27
never 0 35 27
been 0 35 27
able 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
implement 0 35 27
his 0 35 27
nuclear 0 35 27

Trump 0 35 28
and 0 35 28
Corker 0 35 28
have 0 35 28
been 0 35 28
involved 0 35 28
in 0 35 28
an 0 35 28
ugly 1 35 28
public 1 35 28
fight 1 35 28
precipitated 0 35 28
by 0 35 28
Corker’s 0 35 28
announcement 0 35 28
that 0 35 28
he 0 35 28
will 0 35 28
not 0 35 28
be 0 35 28
seeking 0 35 28
reelection 0 35 28

next 0 35 29
year. 0 35 29
Today 0 35 29
Corker 0 35 29
has 0 35 29
nothing 0 35 29
to 0 35 29
restrain 0 35 29
him 0 35 29
from 0 35 29
scuttling 0 35 29

Trump’s 0 35 30
agenda. 0 35 30
If 0 35 30
he 0 35 30
wishes, 0 35 30
out 0 35 30
of 0 35 30
spite, 0 35 30
Corker 0 35 30
can 0 35 30
block 0 35 30
effective 0 35 30
sanctions 0 35 30

from 0 35 31
being 0 35 31
passed. 0 35 31
And 0 35 31
he 0 35 31
may 0 35 31
do 0 35 31
so 0 35 31
even 0 35 31
though 0 35 31
the 0 35 31
implications 0 35 31
for 0 35 31
his 0 35 31
Senate 0 35 31
colleagues 0 35 31
would 0 35 31
be 0 35 31
dire 0 35 31
and 0 35 31
even 0 35 31
though 0 35 31
doing 0 35 31
so 0 35 31
would 0 35 31
render 0 35 31
him 0 35 31
an 0 35 31
unofficial 0 35 31
protector 0 35 31
of 0 35 31
Iran’s 0 35 31

nuclear 0 35 32
program. 0 35 32
What 0 35 32
is 0 35 32
true 0 35 32
for 0 35 32
Corker 0 35 32
is 0 35 32
doubly 0 35 32
true 0 35 32

for 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Democrats. 0 35 33
Leading 0 35 33
Democratic 0 35 33
senators 0 35 33
like 0 35 33
Robert 0 35 33
Menendez, 0 35 33
Ben 0 35 33
Cardin 0 35 33
and 0 35 33
Chuck 0 35 33
Schumer, 0 35 33
who 0 35 33
opposed 0 35 33
Obama’s 0 35 33
Iran 0 35 33
deal 0 35 33
may 0 35 33
now 0 35 33
feel 0 35 33
that 0 35 33
as 0 35 33
opponents 0 35 33
of 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Trump 0 35 33
administration, 0 35 33
they 0 35 33
are 0 35 33
required 0 35 33
to 0 35 33
oppose 0 35 33
any 0 35 33
change 0 35 33
to 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Iran 0 35 33
Nuclear 0 35 33
Agreement 0 35 33

Review 0 35 34
Act. 0 35 34
Indeed, 0 35 34
given 0 35 34
the 0 35 34
rise 0 35 34
of 0 35 34
radical 0 35 34
forces 0 35 34
in 0 35 34
their 0 35 34
party 0 35 34
it 0 35 34
is 0 35 34
likely 0 35 34
that 0 35 34
they 0 35 34
would 0 35 34
rather 0 35 34
give 0 35 34
Iran 0 35 34
a 0 35 34
free 0 35 34
pass 0 35 34
for 0 35 34
its 0 35 34
anti-American 0 35 34
aggression 0 35 34
and 0 35 34
nuclear 0 35 34
proliferation 0 35 34
than 0 35 34
work 0 35 34
with 0 35 34
Republicans 0 35 34
on 0 35 34
Capitol 0 35 34
Hill 0 35 34
and 0 35 34

in 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
White 0 35 35
House. 0 35 35
Then 0 35 35
again, 0 35 35
by 0 35 35
framing 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
issue 0 35 35
of 0 35 35
Iran’s 0 35 35
threat 0 35 35
to 0 35 35
America 0 35 35
as 0 35 35
he 0 35 35
did, 0 35 35
and 0 35 35
by 0 35 35
transferring 0 35 35
responsibility 0 35 35
for 0 35 35
reinstating 0 35 35
sanctions 0 35 35
and 0 35 35
passing 0 35 35
further 0 35 35
sanctions 0 35 35
on 0 35 35
Iran 0 35 35
to 0 35 35
Congress, 0 35 35
Trump 0 35 35
opened 0 35 35
up 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
possibility 0 35 35
that 0 35 35
Congress 0 35 35
will 0 35 35
conduct 0 35 35
substantive 0 35 35
– 0 35 35
rather 0 35 35
than 0 35 35
personal 0 35 35

– 0 35 36
debates 0 35 36
on 0 35 36
Iran. 0 35 36
And 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
more 0 35 36
substantive 0 35 36
those 0 35 36
debates 0 35 36
become, 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
further 0 35 36
away 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
US 0 35 36
discourse 0 35 36
will 0 35 36
move 0 35 36
from 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
mendacious 0 35 36
assumptions 0 35 36
of 0 35 36
Obama’s 0 35 36
Iran 0 35 36
policy 0 35 36
– 0 35 36
that 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
Iranian 0 35 36
regime 0 35 36
is 0 35 36
a 0 35 36
responsible 0 35 36
actor 0 35 36
and 0 35 36
potential 0 35 36
US 0 35 36
ally, 0 35 36
and 0 35 36
that 0 35 36
there 0 35 36
is 0 35 36
nothing 0 35 36
inherently 0 35 36
aggressive 0 35 36
or 0 35 36
problematic 0 35 36
about 0 35 36
Iran’s 0 35 36
illicit 0 35 36
nuclear 0 35 36

weapons 0 35 37
program. 0 35 37
The 0 35 37
second 0 35 37
major 0 35 37
risk 0 35 37
inherent 0 35 37
in 0 35 37
Trump’s 0 35 37
approach 0 35 37
is 0 35 37
that 0 35 37
he 0 35 37
will 0 35 37
get 0 35 37
his 0 35 37
way; 0 35 37
that 0 35 37
the 0 35 37
Europeans, 0 35 37
Russians 0 35 37
and 0 35 37
Chinese 0 35 37
and 0 35 37
the 0 35 37
Iranians 0 35 37
will 0 35 37
agree 0 35 37
to 0 35 37
improve 0 35 37

the 0 35 38
nuclear 0 35 38
deal. 0 35 38
The 0 35 38
problem 0 35 38

here 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
not 0 35 39
obvious. 0 35 39
Clearly, 0 35 39
it 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
better 0 35 39
if 0 35 39
the 0 35 39
deal 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
amended 0 35 39
to 0 35 39
delete 0 35 39
the 0 35 39
sunset 0 35 39
clauses 0 35 39
and 0 35 39
expand 0 35 39

the 0 35 40
inspections 0 35 40
regime. 0 35 40
Yet 0 35 40
even 0 35 40
an 0 35 40
amended, 0 35 40
improved 0 35 40
deal 0 35 40
will 0 35 40
still 0 35 40
serve 0 35 40
as 0 35 40
a 0 35 40
shield 0 35 40
to 0 35 40

Iran’s 0 35 41
nuclear 0 35 41
program. 0 35 41
An 0 35 41
improved 0 35 41
deal 1 35 41
won’t 1 35 41
destroy 1 35 41

Iran’s 0 35 42
centrifuges. 0 35 42
It 1 35 42
won’t 1 35 42
take 0 35 42
away 0 35 42

Iran’s 0 35 43
enriched 0 35 43
uranium. 0 35 43
It 1 35 43
won’t 1 35 43
destroy 1 35 43
Iran’s 0 35 43

nuclear 0 35 44
installations. 0 35 44
And 0 35 44
it 1 35 44
won’t 1 35 44
bring 1 35 44
down 0 35 44
the 0 35 44
regime 0 35 44
which 0 35 44
by 0 35 44
its 0 35 44
nature 0 35 44
ensures 0 35 44
all 0 35 44
of 0 35 44
these 0 35 44
things 0 35 44
will 0 35 44
remain 0 35 44
a 1 35 44
menace 1 35 44
to 1 35 44
the 1 35 44
US, 1 35 44
its 1 35 44
allies 1 35 44
and 1 35 44
international 1 35 44

security 1 35 45
as 1 35 45
a 1 35 45
whole. 1 35 45
So 0 35 45
long 0 35 45
as 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
US 0 35 45
continues 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
maintain 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
policy 0 35 45
based 0 35 45
on 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
false 0 35 45
view 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
all 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
is 0 35 45
necessary 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
destroy 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
threat 0 35 45
of 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
armed 0 35 45
Iran 0 35 45
is 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
combination 0 35 45
of 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
deal 0 35 45
and 0 35 45
economic 0 35 45
sanctions, 0 35 45
it 0 35 45
will 0 35 45
continue 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
ensure 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
Iran 0 35 45
and 0 35 45
its 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
program 0 35 45

remain 0 35 46
a 0 35 46
major 0 35 46
threat. 0 35 46
Distressingly, 0 35 46
US 0 35 46
Ambassador 0 35 46
to 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
UN 0 35 46
Nikki 0 35 46
Haley, 0 35 46
the 1 35 46
most 1 35 46
outspoken 1 35 46
supporter 1 35 46
of 0 35 46
decertifying 0 35 46
Iranian 0 35 46
compliance 0 35 46
in 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
Trump 0 35 46
administration, 0 35 46
told 0 35 46
NBC 0 35 46
on 0 35 46
Sunday 0 35 46
that 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
US 0 35 46
intends 0 35 46
to 0 35 46

remain 0 35 47
in 0 35 47
the 0 35 47
nuclear 0 35 47
deal. 0 35 47
To 0 35 47
understand 0 35 47
what 0 35 47
must 0 35 47
be 0 35 47
done 0 35 47
we 0 35 47
must 0 35 47
return 0 35 47
to 0 35 47
Trump’s 0 35 47
speech 0 35 47
and 0 35 47

its 0 35 48
strategic 0 35 48
significance. 0 35 48
By 0 35 48
taking 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
holistic 0 35 48
view 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
Iranian 0 35 48
threat 0 35 48
– 0 35 48
grounded 0 35 48
in 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
recognition 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
inherent 0 35 48
hostility 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
regime 0 35 48
– 0 35 48
Trump 0 35 48
opened 0 35 48
up 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
possibility 0 35 48
that 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
US 0 35 48
and 0 35 48
its 0 35 48
allies 0 35 48
can 0 35 48
develop 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
holistic 0 35 48
policy 0 35 48
for 0 35 48
confronting 0 35 48
and 0 35 48
defeating 0 35 48

Iran 0 35 49
and 0 35 49
its 0 35 49
proxies. 0 35 49
If 0 35 49
the 0 35 49
Iran 0 35 49
deal 0 35 49
and 0 35 49
sanctions 0 35 49
are 0 35 49
two 0 35 49
components 0 35 49
to 0 35 49
a 0 35 49
larger 0 35 49
strategy 0 35 49
rather 0 35 49
than 0 35 49
the 0 35 49
entire 0 35 49
strategy, 0 35 49

they 0 35 50
can 0 35 50
be 0 35 50
helpful. 0 35 50
A 0 35 50
wider 0 35 50
strategy 0 35 50
would 0 35 50
target 0 35 50
Iran’s 0 35 50
regional 0 35 50
aggression 0 35 50
by 0 35 50
weakening 0 35 50
its 0 35 50
proxies 0 35 50
and 0 35 50
clients 0 35 50
from 0 35 50
Hezbollah 0 35 50
and 0 35 50
Hamas 0 35 50
to 0 35 50
the 0 35 50
regimes 0 35 50
in 0 35 50
Iraq, 0 35 50

Yemen, 0 35 51
Syria 0 35 51
and 0 35 51
Lebanon. 0 35 51
It 0 35 51
would 0 35 51
target 0 35 51
the 0 35 51
regime 0 35 51
itself 0 35 51
by 0 35 51
empowering 0 35 51
the 0 35 51
ayatollahs’ 0 35 51

domestic 0 35 52
opponents. 0 35 52
It 0 35 52
would 0 35 52
pin 0 35 52
down 0 35 52
Iranian 0 35 52
forces 0 35 52
by 0 35 52
arming 0 35 52
and 0 35 52
otherwise 0 35 52
assisting 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
Iraqi 0 35 52
Kurds 0 35 52
to 0 35 52
defend 0 35 52
and 0 35 52
maintain 0 35 52
their 0 35 52
control 0 35 52
over 0 35 52
their 0 35 52
territory 0 35 52
along 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
Iranian 0 35 52
border 0 35 52
while 0 35 52
strengthening 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
ties 0 35 52
between 0 35 52

Iranian 0 35 53
Kurds 0 35 53
and 0 35 53
Iraqi 0 35 53
Kurds. 0 35 53
Friday, 0 35 53
Trump 0 35 53
created 0 35 53
the 0 35 53
possibility 0 35 53

for 0 35 54
such 0 35 54
a 0 35 54
strategy. 0 35 54
It 0 35 54
is 0 35 54
up 0 35 54
to 0 35 54
members 0 35 54
of 0 35 54
Congress, 0 35 54
and 0 35 54
US 0 35 54
allies 0 35 54
like 0 35 54
Israel 0 35 54
and 0 35 54
the 0 35 54
Sunni 0 35 54
Arab 0 35 54
states 0 35 54
to 0 35 54
help 0 35 54
Trump 0 35 54

conceive 0 35 54

and 0 35 54

implement 0 35 54

it. 0 35 54

If 1 35 54

they 1 35 54

fail, 1 35 54

the 1 35 54

possibility 1 35 54

Trump 1 35 54

created 1 35 54

will 1 35 54

be 1 35 54

lost, 1 35 54

perhaps 1 35 54

irrevocably. 1 35 54

The 0 44 1

that’s 0 44 1
airborne 0 44 1

has 0 44 1
killed 0 44 1

124 0 44 1
people 0 44 1

This 0 44 1

the 0 44 1

dance 0 44 1
around 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
bodies. 0 44 1

The 1 44 2
local 1 44 2
tradition 1 44 2
is 1 44 2
said 1 44 2
to 1 44 2
be 1 44 2
one 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
the 1 44 2
major 1 44 2
causes 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
the 1 44 2
spread 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
this 1 44 2
disease. 1 44 2

Since 0 44 3
it’s 0 44 3
airborne, 0 44 3
anyone 0 44 3
coming 0 44 3
close 0 44 3
to 0 44 3

died 0 44 3
of 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
black 0 44 3
death 0 44 3
could 0 44 3
themselves, 0 44 3
catch 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
infection. 0 44 3

Health 1 44 4
officials 1 44 4
suspect 1 44 4
it’s 1 44 4
no 1 44 4
coincidence 1 44 4
that 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
outbreak 1 44 4
coincides 1 44 4
with 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
time 1 44 4

when 1 44 4

customarily 1 44 4

wrap 0 44 4
them 0 44 4
in 0 44 4
a 0 44 4
sheet, 0 44 4
and 0 44 4
dance 0 44 4
with 0 44 4
them 0 44 4
through 0 44 4
the 0 44 4
streets 0 44 4
in 0 44 4

“If 0 44 5

Some 1 44 6
locals 1 44 6
believe 1 44 6
the 1 44 6
whole 1 44 6
plague 1 44 6
is 1 44 6
some 1 44 6
kind 1 44 6
of 1 44 6
a 1 44 6
government 1 44 6
conspiracy, 1 44 6
and 0 44 6
say 0 44 6
they 0 44 6
have 0 44 6
no 0 44 6
intention 0 44 6
of 0 44 6
forgoing 0 44 6
the 0 44 6
ritual 0 44 6
known 0 44 6
as 0 44 6
“famadihana.” 0 44 6
They 0 44 6
say 0 44 6
they 0 44 6
will 0 44 6
continue 0 44 6
to 0 44 6
dance 0 44 6
with 0 44 6
the 0 44 6
dead 0 44 6

intend 0 44 6
to 0 44 6

“I 0 44 7

The 1 44 8
plague 1 44 8
is 1 44 8
a 1 44 8
lie,” 1 44 8

firmly 0 44 9
believes 0 44 9
the 0 44 9
country’s 0 44 9
cash-strapped 1 44 9
government 1 44 9
is 1 44 9
just 1 44 9
exaggerating 1 44 9

it 1 44 10
isn’t 1 44 10
that 1 44 10

At 0 50 9
a 0 50 9

hearing, 0 50 9
Saris 0 50 9
expressed 0 50 9
concern 0 50 9
that 0 50 9

had 0 50 9
broken 0 50 9
its 0 50 9
word 0 50 9
with 0 50 9
Rombot 0 50 9
after 0 50 9
telling 0 50 9
him 0 50 9
in 0 50 9
2015 0 50 9
that 0 50 9
he 0 50 9
would 0 50 9
"be 0 50 9

opportunity 0 50 9

an 0 50 9
orderly 0 50 9
departure" 0 50 9
before 0 50 9
being 0 50 9
deported. 0 50 9

She 0 50 10
also 0 50 10
expressed 0 50 10
concern 0 50 10
he 0 50 10
was 0 50 10
being 0 50 10
held 0 50 10
alongside 0 50 10
potentially 0 50 10
violent 0 50 10
criminals. 0 50 10

Her 0 50 11
problem 0 50 11
though 0 50 11
was 0 50 11
that 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
law 0 50 11
and 0 50 11

are 0 50 11

the 0 50 11
side 0 50 11
of 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
continued 0 50 11
deportation 0 50 11
of 0 50 11
aliens. 0 50 11

Kritarch 0 50 12
Saris 0 50 12
has 0 50 12
apparently 0 50 12
seen 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
SCOTUS 0 50 12
writing 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
wall, 0 50 12
and 0 50 12
perhaps 0 50 12
had 1 50 12
an 1 50 12
attack 1 50 12
of 1 50 12
her 1 50 12
legal 1 50 12
conscience 1 50 12
and 0 50 12
decided 0 50 12
that 0 50 12
she 0 50 12
will 0 50 12
acquiesce 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
major 0 50 12
issue, 0 50 12
but 0 50 12
fight 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
a 0 50 12
minor 0 50 12

decided 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
bend 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
inevitable 0 50 14
in 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
case 0 50 14
of 0 50 14

had 0 50 14
years 0 50 14

all 0 50 14
to 0 50 14

do 0 50 14
a 0 50 14
little 0 50 14
sabotage 0 50 14
instead.However, 0 50 14
she 1 50 14
will 1 50 14
not 1 50 14
let 1 50 14
it 1 50 14
go 1 50 14
quietly 1 50 14

night.What 1 50 14
we 0 50 14
have 0 50 14
here 0 50 14
is 0 50 14
that 0 50 14
Saris 0 50 14
realized 0 50 14
she 0 50 14
has 0 50 14
no 0 50 14

over 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
deportation 0 50 14
of 0 50 14

but 0 50 14
she 0 50 14
will 0 50 14
do 0 50 14
her 0 50 14
best 0 50 14
to 0 50 14

First, 0 59 15
let's 0 59 15
deal 0 59 15
with 0 59 15
the 0 59 15
misleading 0 59 15
reporting. 0 59 15

Rombot 0 59 16
was 0 59 16
not 0 59 16
taken 0 59 16
into 0 59 16
custody 0 59 16
based 0 59 16
on 0 59 16
any 0 59 16

of 0 59 16
deporting 0 59 16
all 0 59 16
illegal 1 59 16
aliens. 1 59 16

Rombot 0 59 17
was 0 59 17
taken 0 59 17
into 0 59 17
custody 0 59 17
because 0 59 17
he 0 59 17
had 0 59 17
an 0 59 17
outstanding 0 59 17
Final 0 59 17
Order 0 59 17
Of 0 59 17
Removal; 0 59 17
that's 1 59 17
a 1 59 17
big 1 59 17
difference 1 59 17
and 1 59 17
symptomatic 1 59 17
of 1 59 17
the 1 59 17
lies 1 59 17
from 1 59 17
reporters 1 59 17
like 1 59 17
Raymond. 1 59 17

Saris 0 59 18
previously 0 59 18
ordered 0 59 18
a 0 59 18
stay 0 59 18
to 0 59 18
the 0 59 18
deportations. 0 59 18

She 0 59 19
is 0 59 19
currently 0 59 19
weighing 0 59 19
whether 0 59 19
she 0 59 19
can 0 59 19
order 0 59 19
a 0 59 19
longer 0 59 19
delay 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
give 0 59 19
the 0 59 19
affected 0 59 19
people 0 59 19
time 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
renew 0 59 19
their 0 59 19
efforts 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
gain 0 59 19
legal 0 59 19
status. 0 59 19

Now, 0 59 20
with 0 59 20
regard 0 59 20
to 0 59 20
Saris, 0 59 20
she 0 59 20
has 0 59 20
no 0 59 20
authority 0 59 20
to 0 59 20
interfere 0 59 20
with 0 59 20
the 0 59 20
pre-deportation 0 59 20
custody 0 59 20
of 0 59 20
an 0 59 20
illegal 1 59 20
alien 1 59 20
with 0 59 20
a 0 59 20
Final 0 59 20
Order 0 59 20
Of 0 59 20
Removal. 0 59 20

Rombot 0 59 21
was 0 59 21
taken 0 59 21
into 0 59 21
custody 0 59 21
because 0 59 21
he 0 59 21
was 0 59 21
soon 0 59 21
to 0 59 21
be 0 59 21
deported. 0 59 21

There 0 59 22
was 0 59 22
no 0 59 22
issue 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
Indonesia 0 59 22
not 0 59 22
accepting 0 59 22
him 0 59 22
nor 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
Indonesia 0 59 22
not 0 59 22
providing 0 59 22
a 0 59 22
travel 0 59 22
document, 0 59 22
so 0 59 22
there 0 59 22
was 0 59 22
no 0 59 22
question 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
him 0 59 22
being 0 59 22
held 0 59 22
in 0 59 22
custody 0 59 22
longer 0 59 22
than 0 59 22
allowed 0 59 22
in 0 59 22
the 0 59 22
St. 0 59 22
Cyr 0 59 22
decision 0 59 22
that 0 59 22
restricted 0 59 22
custody 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
illegal 1 59 22
aliens 1 59 22
with 0 59 22
Final 0 59 22
Orders 0 59 22
Of 0 59 22
Removal 0 59 22
who 0 59 22
for 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
reason 0 59 22
were 0 59 22
unlikely 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
be 0 59 22
successfully 0 59 22
deported. 0 59 22

She 0 59 23
still 0 59 23
thinks 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
she 0 59 23
can 0 59 23
review 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
underlying 0 59 23
decision 0 59 23
of 0 59 23

as 0 59 23
well.In 0 59 23
fact, 0 59 23
Saris' 0 59 23
actions 0 59 23
appear 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
more 0 59 23
akin 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
of 0 59 23

to 0 59 23
escape 0 59 23

ICE 0 59 23
when 0 59 23
she 0 59 23
let 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
illegal 1 59 23
alien 1 59 23
leave 0 59 23

through 0 59 23

The 0 63 1
pneumonic 0 63 1
plague 0 63 1
has 0 63 1
already 0 63 1
infected 0 63 1
2,000 0 63 1
in 0 63 1
Madagascar 0 63 1
and 0 63 1
killed 0 63 1
143 0 63 1

country’s 0 63 1
worst 0 63 1
outbreak 0 63 1
in 0 63 1

years. 0 63 1

But 0 63 2
health 0 63 2
officials 0 63 2
are 0 63 2
now 0 63 2
warning 0 63 2
the 1 63 2
deadly 1 63 2
bacteria 1 63 2
could 1 63 2
mutate 1 63 2
and 1 63 2
become 1 63 2
untreatable 1 63 2
as 0 63 2
it 0 63 2
spreads 0 63 2
across 0 63 2
the 0 63 2
globe. 0 63 2

Coupled 0 63 3
with 0 63 3
the 0 63 3
high 0 63 3
likelihood 0 63 3
that 0 63 3
this 0 63 3
disease 0 63 3
could 0 63 3
spread 0 63 3
globally 0 63 3
by 0 63 3
an 0 63 3
infected 0 63 3
traveler 0 63 3
getting 0 63 3
on 0 63 3

to 0 63 3

or 0 63 3
America, 0 63 3
health 0 63 3
officials 0 63 3
are 0 63 3
now 0 63 3
warning 0 63 3
that 0 63 3

strain 0 63 3
of 0 63 3

which 0 63 3
has 0 63 3

more 0 63 3

140 0 63 3

become 1 63 3
untreatable. 1 63 3

Professor 0 63 4
Paul 0 63 4
Hunter 0 63 4
has 0 63 4
warned 0 63 4
that, 0 63 4
while 0 63 4
it 0 63 4
would 0 63 4
be 0 63 4
rather 0 63 4
easy 0 63 4
for 0 63 4
an 0 63 4
advanced 0 63 4
country 0 63 4
to 0 63 4
contain 0 63 4
the 0 63 4
disease 0 63 4
in 0 63 4
its 0 63 4
current 0 63 4
form, 0 63 4
he 1 63 4
fears 1 63 4
that 1 63 4
it 1 63 4
could 1 63 4
evolve 1 63 4
into 1 63 4
something 1 63 4
far 1 63 4
more 1 63 4
dangerous. 1 63 4

Hunter, 0 63 5
who 0 63 5
is 0 63 5
a 0 63 5
disease 0 63 5
expert 0 63 5
at 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
University 0 63 5
of 0 63 5
East 0 63 5
Anglia, 0 63 5
told 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
Daily 0 63 5
Star: 0 63 5
“If 0 63 5
it 0 63 5
reaches 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
UK, 0 63 5
Europe 0 63 5
or 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
US 0 63 5
it 0 63 5
would 0 63 5
be 0 63 5
similar 0 63 5
to 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
Ebola 0 63 5
outbreak. 0 63 5

We 0 63 6
would 0 63 6
have 0 63 6
a 0 63 6
few 0 63 6
isolated 0 63 6
cases 0 63 6
but 0 63 6
it 0 63 6
shouldn’t 0 63 6
spread 0 63 6
like 0 63 6
it 0 63 6
has 0 63 6
in 0 63 6
Madagascar.” 0 63 6
But 0 63 6
he 0 63 6
had 0 63 6
more 0 63 6
to 0 63 6
add. 0 63 6

“As 0 63 7
with 0 63 7
any 0 63 7
disease, 0 63 7
it’s 1 63 7
a 1 63 7
real 1 63 7
worry 1 63 7
that 1 63 7
it 1 63 7
mutates 1 63 7
and 1 63 7
become 1 63 7
untreatable,” 1 63 7
Hunter 0 63 7
said. 0 63 7

So 0 63 8
far, 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
majority 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
recent 0 63 8
cases 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
black 0 63 8
death 0 63 8
have 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
been 0 63 8
pneumonic 0 63 8
plague, 0 63 8
a 0 63 8
more 0 63 8
deadly 0 63 8
form 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
bubonic 0 63 8
plague 0 63 8
which 0 63 8
devastated 1 63 8
Europe’s 0 63 8
population 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
1300s. 0 63 8

While 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
bubonic 0 63 9
plague 0 63 9
is 0 63 9
spread 0 63 9
through 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
bites 0 63 9
of 0 63 9
infected 0 63 9
fleas, 0 63 9
pneumonic 0 63 9
plague 0 63 9
is 0 63 9
spread 0 63 9
through 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
air, 0 63 9
usually 0 63 9
by 0 63 9
coughing. 0 63 9

Airborne 0 63 10

are 0 63 10
difficult 1 63 10
at 1 63 10
best 1 63 10
to 0 63 10
control. 0 63 10

Symptoms 0 63 11
of 0 63 11
the 0 63 11
plague 0 63 11
include 0 63 11
a 0 63 11
very 0 63 11

fever, 0 63 11
coughing 0 63 11
(potentially 0 63 11

will 0 86 8
doubt 0 86 8

In 0 86 10

both 0 86 26

abound; 0 86 26
the 0 86 26
charity 0 86 26
of 0 86 26
many 0 86 26
will 0 86 26

the 1 86 26

the 0 91 3

But 0 91 4
experts 0 91 4
now 0 91 4
warn 0 91 4
that 0 91 4
because 0 91 4
they 0 91 4
are 0 91 4

used 0 91 4
so 0 91 4
much 0 91 4
to 0 91 4

the 0 91 4
infection, 0 91 4
antibiotics 1 91 4
resistance 1 91 4
is 1 91 4
inevitable 1 91 4
and 0 91 4
making 1 91 4
this 1 91 4
disease 1 91 4
much 1 91 4
more 1 91 4
terrifying. 1 91 4

Once 0 91 5
the 0 91 5
bacteria 0 91 5
is 0 91 5
resistant, 0 91 5
the 0 91 5
Madagascar 0 91 5

be 0 91 5

Madagascar’s 1 91 6

known 0 92 4
that 0 92 4

behind 0 92 4

Earlier 0 92 6
this 0 92 6

about 0 92 6
how 0 92 6
“sexual 1 92 6

rampant 1 92 6
in 1 92 6
the 1 92 6

and 0 92 6
that 0 92 6
was 0 92 6
before 0 92 6
a 0 92 6
female 0 92 6
radio 0 92 6

that 0 92 6
Al 0 92 6

had 0 92 6
“forcibly 0 92 6
kissed” 0 92 6

her 0 92 6
during 0 92 6
a 0 92 6

tour 0 92 6
in 0 92 6

The 0 92 7
following 0 92 7

from 0 92 7
an 0 92 7
article 0 92 7
in 0 92 7
which 0 92 7
Tweeden 0 92 7
shared 0 92 7
her 0 92 7
story… 0 92 7

I 0 92 8
couldn’t 0 92 8
believe 0 92 8
it. 0 92 8

He 0 92 9
groped 0 92 9
me, 0 92 9
without 0 92 9
my 0 92 9
consent, 0 92 9
while 0 92 9
I 0 92 9
was 0 92 9
asleep. 0 92 9

I 1 92 10
felt 1 92 10
violated 1 92 10
all 1 92 10
over 1 92 10
again. 1 92 10

Embarrassed. 1 92 11

Belittled. 1 92 12

Humiliated. 1 92 13

How 0 92 14
dare 0 92 14
anyone 0 92 14
grab 0 92 14
my 0 92 14
breasts 0 92 14
like 0 92 14
this 0 92 14
and 0 92 14
think 0 92 14
it’s 0 92 14
funny? 0 92 14

I 0 92 15
told 0 92 15
my 0 92 15
husband 0 92 15
everything 0 92 15
that 0 92 15
happened 0 92 15
and 0 92 15
showed 0 92 15
him 0 92 15
the 0 92 15
picture. 0 92 15

I 0 92 16
wanted 0 92 16
to 0 92 16
shout 1 92 16
my 1 92 16
story 1 92 16
to 1 92 16
the 1 92 16
world 1 92 16
with 1 92 16
a 1 92 16
megaphone 1 92 16
to 0 92 16
anyone 0 92 16
who 0 92 16
would 0 92 16
listen, 0 92 16
but 0 92 16
even 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
angry 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
I 0 92 16
was, 0 92 16
I 0 92 16
was 0 92 16
worried 0 92 16
about 0 92 16
the 0 92 16
potential 0 92 16
backlash 0 92 16
and 0 92 16
damage 0 92 16
going 0 92 16
public 0 92 16
might 0 92 16
have 0 92 16
on 0 92 16
my 0 92 16
career 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
a 0 92 16
broadcaster. 0 92 16

But 0 92 17
that 0 92 17
was 0 92 17
then, 0 92 17
this 0 92 17
is 0 92 17
now. 0 92 17

I’m 1 92 18
no 1 92 18
longer 1 92 18
afraid. 1 92 18

When 0 92 19
the 0 92 19
story 0 92 19
initially 0 92 19
broke, 0 92 19
Franken 0 92 19
rushed 0 92 19
to 0 92 19
issue 0 92 19
an 0 92 19
apology… 0 92 19

“I 0 92 20
certainly 0 92 20
don’t 0 92 20
remember 0 92 20
the 0 92 20

skit 0 92 20
in 0 92 20
the 0 92 20
same 0 92 20
way, 0 92 20
but 0 92 20
I 0 92 20
send 0 92 20
my 0 92 20
sincerest 0 92 20
apologies 0 92 20
to 0 92 20

“As 0 92 21
to 0 92 21
the 0 92 21
photo, 0 92 21
it 0 92 21
was 0 92 21
clearly 0 92 21
intended 0 92 21
to 0 92 21
be 0 92 21
funny 0 92 21
but 0 92 21
wasn’t. 0 92 21

I 0 92 22
shouldn’t 0 92 22
have 0 92 22
done 0 92 22
it.” 0 92 22

Needless 0 92 23
to 0 92 23
say, 0 92 23
many 0 92 23
were 0 92 23
completely 1 92 23

of 0 92 24

be 1 92 27
held 1 92 27
accountable 1 92 27
if 1 92 27
our 1 92 27
party 1 92 27
wants 1 92 27
to 1 92 27
live 1 92 27
up 1 92 27
to 1 92 27
our 1 92 27
commitment 1 92 27
to 1 92 27
women 1 92 27
& 1 92 27
girls.” 1 92 27

This 0 92 28
scandal 0 92 28
has 0 92 28
set 0 92 28
off 0 92 28
a 0 92 28
feeding 1 92 28
frenzy 1 92 28
as 0 92 28
Internet 0 92 28
sleuths 0 92 28
search 0 92 28
for 0 92 28
other 0 92 28
incidents 0 92 28
in 0 92 28
which 0 92 28
Franken 0 92 28
has 0 92 28
acted 0 92 28
inappropriately. 0 92 28

And 0 92 29
of 0 92 29
course, 0 92 29
since 0 92 29
we 0 92 29
are 0 92 29
talking 0 92 29
about 0 92 29
Al 0 92 29
Franken, 0 92 29
it 0 92 29
wasn’t 0 92 29
exactly 0 92 29
difficult 0 92 29
to 0 92 29
find 0 92 29
material. 0 92 29

For 0 92 30
example, 0 92 30
a 0 92 30
photo 0 92 30
has 0 92 30
surfaced 0 92 30
of 0 92 30
Franken 0 92 30
grabbing 0 92 30
Joy 0 92 30
Behar 0 92 30
in 0 92 30
a 0 92 30
very 1 92 30
creepy 1 92 30
manner. 1 92 30

The 0 92 31
following 0 92 31
comes 0 92 31
from 0 92 31
Breitbart… 0 92 31

Amid 0 92 32
the 0 92 32
emergence 0 92 32
of 0 92 32
a 0 92 32
2006 0 92 32
photo 0 92 32
of 0 92 32
Al 0 92 32
Franken 0 92 32
groping 0 92 32
journalist 0 92 32
and 0 92 32
talk 0 92 32
radio 0 92 32
anchor 0 92 32
Leeann 0 92 32
Tweeden, 0 92 32
a 0 92 32
photo 0 92 32
of 0 92 32
the 0 92 32
embattled 0 92 32
Minnesota 0 92 32
Senator 0 92 32
appearing 0 92 32
to 0 92 32
grab 0 92 32
comedian 0 92 32
Joy 0 92 32
Behar’s 0 92 32
breast 0 92 32
has 0 92 32
also 0 92 32
resurfaced. 0 92 32

Franken 0 92 33
was 0 92 33
a 0 92 33
comedian 0 92 33
before 0 92 33
he 0 92 33
ever 0 92 33
entered 0 92 33
the 0 92 33
world 0 92 33
of 0 92 33
politics, 0 92 33
and 0 92 33
we 0 92 33
understand 0 92 33
that. 0 92 33

But 0 92 34
just 0 92 34
because 0 92 34
he 0 92 34
was 0 92 34
a 0 92 34
comedian 0 92 34
does 0 92 34
not 0 92 34
mean 0 92 34
that 0 92 34
he 0 92 34
gets 0 92 34
to 0 92 34
play 0 92 34
by 0 92 34
a 0 92 34
different 0 92 34
set 0 92 34
of 0 92 34
rules. 0 92 34

There 0 92 35
appears 0 92 35
to 0 92 35
be 0 92 35
an 0 92 35
ongoing 0 92 35
pattern 0 92 35
of 0 92 35
behavior, 0 92 35
and 0 92 35
Fox 0 92 35
News 0 92 35
has 0 92 35
documented 0 92 35
some 0 92 35
of 0 92 35
the 0 92 35
other 0 92 35
incidents 0 92 35
that 0 92 35
have 0 92 35
come 0 92 35
up 0 92 35
in 0 92 35
the 0 92 35
past… 0 92 35

Franken, 0 92 36
then 0 92 36
a 0 92 36
comedian, 0 92 36
was 0 92 36
quoted 0 92 36
in 0 92 36
a 0 92 36
1995 0 92 36
New 0 92 36
York 0 92 36
Magazine 0 92 36
article 0 92 36
discussing 0 92 36
a 0 92 36
skit 0 92 36
for 0 92 36
“Saturday 0 92 36
Night 0 92 36
Live” 0 92 36
that 0 92 36
involved 0 92 36
drugging 1 92 36
and 1 92 36
raping 1 92 36
CBS 1 92 36
reporter 1 92 36
Lesley 1 92 36
Stahl. 1 92 36

Franken, 0 92 37
at 0 92 37
the 0 92 37
time 0 92 37
a 0 92 37
writer 0 92 37
for 0 92 37
“SNL,” 0 92 37
suggested 0 92 37
one 0 92 37
skit 0 92 37
should 0 92 37
play 0 92 37
out 0 92 37
with 0 92 37
“60 0 92 37
Minutes” 0 92 37
commentator 0 92 37
Andy 0 92 37
Rooney 0 92 37
finding 0 92 37
an 0 92 37
empty 0 92 37
pill 0 92 37
bottle 0 92 37
on 0 92 37
his 0 92 37
desk. 0 92 37

“’I 0 92 38
give 0 92 38
the 0 92 38
pills 0 92 38
to 0 92 38
Lesley 0 92 38
Stahl. 0 92 38

Then 0 92 39
when 0 92 39
Lesley 0 92 39
is 0 92 39
passed 0 92 39
out, 0 92 39
I 1 92 39
take 1 92 39
her 1 92 39
to 1 92 39
the 1 92 39
closet 1 92 39
and 1 92 39
rape 1 92 39
her.’ 1 92 39
Or 0 92 39
‘That’s 0 92 39
why 0 92 39
you 0 92 39
never 0 92 39
see 0 92 39
Lesley 0 92 39
until 0 92 39
February.’ 0 92 39
Or, 0 92 39
‘When 0 92 39
she 0 92 39
passes 0 92 39
out. 0 92 39

I 0 92 40
put 0 92 40
her 0 92 40
in 0 92 40
various 0 92 40
positions 0 92 40
and 0 92 40
take 0 92 40
pictures 0 92 40
of 0 92 40
her,’” 0 92 40
Franken 0 92 40
was 0 92 40
quoted 0 92 40
saying. 0 92 40

The 0 92 41
article, 0 92 41
along 0 92 41
with 0 92 41
a 0 92 41
2000 0 92 41
Playboy 0 92 41
column 0 92 41
in 0 92 41
which 0 92 41
Franken 0 92 41
talked 0 92 41
about 0 92 41
fantasizing 1 92 41
a 1 92 41
machine 1 92 41
would 1 92 41
perform 1 92 41
oral 1 92 41
sex 1 92 41
on 1 92 41
him, 1 92 41
was 0 92 41
used 0 92 41
to 0 92 41
attack 0 92 41
Franken 0 92 41
during 0 92 41
his 0 92 41
2008 0 92 41
Senate 0 92 41
campaign 0 92 41
in 0 92 41
Minnesota. 0 92 41

As 1 92 42
much 1 92 42
as 1 92 42
we 1 92 42
may 1 92 42
be 1 92 42
appalled 1 92 42
by 1 92 42
some 1 92 42
of 1 92 42
the 1 92 42
things 1 92 42
that 1 92 42
Al 1 92 42
Franken 1 92 42
has 1 92 42
done, 1 92 42
the 1 92 42
truth 1 92 42
is 1 92 42
that 1 92 42
there 1 92 42
are 1 92 42
far 1 92 42
worse 1 92 42
offenders 1 92 42
in 1 92 42
Washington. 1 92 42

Let’s 0 92 43
talk 0 92 43
about 0 92 43
Bill 0 92 43
Clinton 0 92 43
for 0 92 43
a 0 92 43
moment. 0 92 43

Democrats 0 92 44
have 0 92 44
been 0 92 44
covering 0 92 44
up 0 92 44
his 0 92 44
sexual 0 92 44
crimes 0 92 44
for 0 92 44
years, 0 92 44
and 0 92 44
my 0 92 44
hope 0 92 44
is 0 92 44
that 0 92 44
now 0 92 44
this 0 92 44
will 0 92 44
start 0 92 44
to 0 92 44
change. 0 92 44

allegations 0 92 45
against 0 92 45

and 1 92 45
if 1 92 45
even 1 92 45
half 1 92 45
of 1 92 45
their 1 92 45
allegations 1 92 45
are 1 92 45
true 1 92 45
Clinton 1 92 45
should 1 92 45

In 0 92 46
my 0 92 46
article 0 92 46
yesterday, 0 92 46
I 0 92 46
discussed 0 92 46
how 0 92 46
one 0 92 46
Secret 0 92 46
Service 0 92 46
agent 0 92 46
is 0 92 46
charging 0 92 46
former 0 92 46
Vice-President 0 92 46
Joe 0 92 46
Biden 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
engaging 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
“Weinstein-level” 1 92 46
behavior, 1 92 46
and 0 92 46
I 0 92 46
also 0 92 46
talked 0 92 46
about 0 92 46
how 0 92 46
15 0 92 46
million 0 92 46
dollars 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
settlements 0 92 46
have 0 92 46
been 0 92 46
secretly 0 92 46
paid 0 92 46
out 0 92 46
to 0 92 46
victims 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
sexual 0 92 46
harassment 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
the 0 92 46
House 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
Representatives 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
recent 0 92 46
years. 0 92 46

There 1 92 47
is 1 92 47
a 1 92 47
culture 1 92 47
of 1 92 47
corruption 1 92 47
in 1 92 47
Washington 1 92 47
D.C., 1 92 47
and 1 92 47
we 1 92 47
desperately 1 92 47
need 1 92 47
to 1 92 47
drain 1 92 47
the 1 92 47
swamp. 1 92 47

If 1 92 48
you 1 92 48
agree, 1 92 48
I 1 92 48
hope 1 92 48
that 1 92 48
you 1 92 48
will 1 92 48
support 1 92 48
my 1 92 48
campaign 1 92 48
and 1 92 48
the 1 92 48
campaigns 1 92 48
of 1 92 48
other 1 92 48
anti-establishment 1 92 48
candidates 1 92 48
that 1 92 48
want 1 92 48
to 1 92 48
clean 1 92 48
up 1 92 48
the 1 92 48
halls 1 92 48
of 1 92 48
Congress. 1 92 48

It 0 92 49
is 0 92 49
time 0 92 49
to 0 92 49
take 0 92 49
our 0 92 49
government 0 92 49
back 0 92 49
because 0 92 49
at 0 92 49
this 0 92 49
point 0 92 49
it 0 92 49
has 0 92 49
become 0 92 49
an 0 92 49
absolutely 1 92 49
disgusting 1 92 49
cesspool 1 92 49
of 1 92 49

and 1 92 49
corruption. 1 92 49

Reid 0 95 5
Wilson, 0 95 5
a 0 95 5
correspondent 0 95 5
for 0 95 5
the 0 95 5
Hill, 0 95 5
has 0 95 5
posted 0 95 5
to 0 95 5
Twitter 0 95 5
a 0 95 5
year 0 95 5
by 0 95 5
year 0 95 5
breakdown 0 95 5
of 0 95 5
sexual 0 95 5
harassment 0 95 5
settlements 0 95 5
and 0 95 5
awards 0 95 5
that 0 95 5
he 0 95 5
received 0 95 5
from 0 95 5
the 0 95 5
Congressional 0 95 5
Office 0 95 5
of 0 95 5
Compliance. 0 95 5

I 0 95 6
went 0 95 6
ahead 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
added 0 95 6
up 0 95 6
each 0 95 6
column, 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
what 0 95 6
I 0 95 6
discovered 0 95 6
is 0 95 6
that 0 95 6
264 0 95 6
cases 0 95 6
of 0 95 6
sexual 0 95 6
harassment 0 95 6
in 0 95 6
Congress 0 95 6
have 0 95 6
been 0 95 6
settled 0 95 6
since 0 95 6
1997, 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
the 0 95 6
total 0 95 6
amount 0 95 6
awarded 0 95 6
in 0 95 6
those 0 95 6
settlements 0 95 6
comes 0 95 6
to 0 95 6
a 0 95 6
grand 0 95 6
total 0 95 6
of 0 95 6
$17,250,854. 0 95 6

So 0 95 7
where 0 95 7
has 0 95 7
the 0 95 7
$17,250,854 0 95 7
come 0 95 7
from 0 95 7
to 0 95 7
pay 0 95 7
those 0 95 7
settlements? 0 95 7

That 1 95 8
money 1 95 8
has 1 95 8
come 1 95 8
from 1 95 8
the 1 95 8
taxpayers 1 95 8
of 1 95 8
course. 1 95 8

That 0 95 9
means 0 95 9
that 0 95 9
you 0 95 9
and 0 95 9
I 0 95 9
have 0 95 9
been 0 95 9
paying 0 95 9
to 0 95 9
cover 0 95 9
up 0 95 9
the 1 95 9
epidemic 1 95 9
of 1 95 9

that 0 95 9

more 0 95 10
than 0 95 10
15 0 95 10

had 0 95 10
been 0 95 10
paid 0 95 10
out 0 95 10
to 0 95 10
victims 0 95 10
of 0 95 10
sexual 0 95 10
harassment 0 95 10
in 0 95 10
recent 0 95 10
years, 0 95 10
I 0 95 10
was 0 95 10
envisioning 0 95 10
a 0 95 10
few 0 95 10
dozen 0 95 10
cases 0 95 10
at 0 95 10
most. 0 95 10

I 0 95 11
had 0 95 11
no 0 95 11
idea 0 95 11
that 0 95 11
the 0 95 11
total 0 95 11
number 0 95 11
of 0 95 11
cases 0 95 11
would 0 95 11
actually 0 95 11
be 0 95 11
well 0 95 11
over 0 95 11
200. 0 95 11

If 0 95 12
our 0 95 12
leaders 0 95 12
were 0 95 12
serious 0 95 12
about 0 95 12
stopping 0 95 12
this 0 95 12
from 0 95 12
happening, 0 95 12
they 0 95 12
would 0 95 12
pass 0 95 12
a 0 95 12
law 0 95 12
making 0 95 12
it 0 95 12
mandatory 0 95 12
that 0 95 12
all 0 95 12
cases 0 95 12
of 0 95 12
sexual 0 95 12
harassment 0 95 12
in 0 95 12
Congress 0 95 12
be 0 95 12
made 0 95 12
public, 0 95 12
and 0 95 12
that 0 95 12
members 0 95 12
of 0 95 12
Congress 0 95 12
would 0 95 12
be 0 95 12
personally 0 95 12
responsible 0 95 12
for 0 95 12
paying 0 95 12
out 0 95 12
any 0 95 12
settlements. 0 95 12

If 1 95 13
such 1 95 13
a 1 95 13
law 1 95 13
was 1 95 13
instituted, 1 95 13
I 1 95 13
guarantee 1 95 13
you 1 95 13
that 1 95 13
sexual 1 95 13
harassment 1 95 13
on 1 95 13
Capitol 1 95 13
Hill 1 95 13
would 1 95 13
come 1 95 13
to 1 95 13
a 1 95 13
screeching 1 95 13
halt. 1 95 13

But 0 95 14
they 0 95 14
don’t 0 95 14
want 0 95 14
it 0 95 14
to 0 95 14
stop. 0 95 14

For 1 95 15
many 1 95 15
in 1 95 15
Congress, 1 95 15
having 1 95 15
so 1 95 15
many 1 95 15
attractive 1 95 15
young 1 95 15
women 1 95 15
around 1 95 15
is 1 95 15
one 1 95 15
of 1 95 15
the 1 95 15
key 1 95 15
benefits 1 95 15
of 1 95 15
the 1 95 15
job. 1 95 15

I 0 95 16
included 0 95 16
the 0 95 16
following 0 95 16
quote 0 95 16
from 0 95 16
CNN 0 95 16
in 0 95 16
an 0 95 16
article 0 95 16
the 0 95 16
other 0 95 16
day, 0 95 16
but 0 95 16
I 0 95 16
also 0 95 16
believe 0 95 16
that 0 95 16
it 0 95 16
fits 0 95 16
just 0 95 16
perfectly 0 95 16
here… 0 95 16

In 0 95 17
an 0 95 17
environment 0 95 17
with 0 95 17
“so 0 95 17
many 0 95 17
young 0 95 17
women,” 0 95 17
said 0 95 17
one 0 95 17
ex-House 0 95 17
aide, 0 95 17
the 1 95 17
men 1 95 17
“have 1 95 17
no 1 95 17
self-control.” 1 95 17
“Amongst 0 95 17
ourselves, 0 95 17
we 0 95 17
know,” 0 95 17
a 0 95 17
former 0 95 17
Senate 0 95 17
staffer 0 95 17
said 0 95 17
of 0 95 17
the 1 95 17
lawmakers 1 95 17
with 1 95 17
the 1 95 17
worst 1 95 17
reputations. 1 95 17

And 0 95 18
sometimes, 0 95 18
the 0 95 18
sexual 0 95 18
advances 0 95 18
from 0 95 18
members 0 95 18
of 0 95 18
Congress 0 95 18
or 0 95 18
senior 0 95 18
aides 0 95 18
are 0 95 18
reciprocated 0 95 18
in 0 95 18
the 0 95 18
hopes 0 95 18
of 0 95 18
advancing 0 95 18
one’s 0 95 18
career 0 95 18
— 0 95 18
what 0 95 18
one 0 95 18
political 0 95 18
veteran 0 95 18
bluntly 0 95 18
referred 0 95 18
to 0 95 18
as 0 95 18
a 0 95 18
“sex 1 95 18
trade 1 95 18
on 1 95 18
Capitol 1 95 18
Hill.” 1 95 18

Do 0 95 19
you 0 95 19
want 0 95 19
to 0 95 19
stop 0 95 19
this 0 95 19
from 0 95 19
happening? 0 95 19

It 1 95 20
isn’t 1 95 20
going 1 95 20
to 1 95 20
stop 1 95 20
until 1 95 20
we 1 95 20
boot 1 95 20
out 1 95 20
the 1 95 20
corrupt 1 95 20
career 1 95 20
politicians 1 95 20
that 1 95 20
are 1 95 20
engaging 1 95 20
in 1 95 20
this 1 95 20
type 1 95 20
of 1 95 20
behavior. 1 95 20

So 0 95 21
I 0 95 21
am 0 95 21
asking 0 95 21
you 0 95 21
to 0 95 21
support 0 95 21
my 0 95 21
campaign 0 95 21
and 0 95 21
other 0 95 21
“grassroots 1 95 21
deplorables” 1 95 21
that 0 95 21
are 0 95 21
running 0 95 21
for 0 95 21
office 0 95 21
all 0 95 21
over 0 95 21
the 0 95 21
nation. 0 95 21

Morality 0 95 22
really 0 95 22
matters 0 95 22
when 0 95 22
it 0 95 22
comes 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
serving 0 95 22
in 0 95 22
public 0 95 22
office, 0 95 22
and 0 95 22
we 0 95 22
are 0 95 22
not 0 95 22
going 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
send 0 95 22
people 0 95 22
that 0 95 22
engage 0 95 22
in 0 95 22
sexually 0 95 22
inappropriate 0 95 22
behavior 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
Washington 0 95 22
anymore. 0 95 22

And 0 95 23
I 0 95 23
am 0 95 23
calling 0 95 23
on 0 95 23
Congress 0 95 23
to 0 95 23
immediately 0 95 23
release 0 95 23
the 0 95 23
details 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
all 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
the 0 95 23
264 0 95 23
cases 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
sexual 0 95 23
harassment 0 95 23
that 0 95 23
have 0 95 23
been 0 95 23
settled 0 95 23
since 0 95 23
1997. 0 95 23

The 1 95 24
American 1 95 24
people 1 95 24
have 1 95 24
a 1 95 24
right 1 95 24
to 1 95 24
know, 1 95 24
and 0 95 24
those 0 95 24
that 0 95 24
engaged 0 95 24
in 0 95 24
this 0 95 24
type 0 95 24
of 0 95 24
behavior 0 95 24
do 0 95 24
not 0 95 24
have 0 95 24
a 0 95 24
right 0 95 24
to 0 95 24
hide. 0 95 24

It 0 95 25
is 0 95 25
time 0 95 25
to 0 95 25
drain 0 95 25
the 0 95 25
swamp, 0 95 25
and 0 95 25
this 0 95 25
would 0 95 25
be 0 95 25
a 0 95 25
really 0 95 25
good 0 95 25
place 0 95 25
to 0 95 25
start. 0 95 25

Right 0 96 1
about 0 96 1
now 0 96 1
the 0 96 1
people 0 96 1
in 0 96 1
the 0 96 1
Clinton 0 96 1
camp 0 96 1
should 0 96 1
be 0 96 1
getting 0 96 1
very 1 96 1
nervous 1 96 1
about 0 96 1
the 0 96 1
ongoing 0 96 1
investigations 0 96 1
into 0 96 1
the 0 96 1
Uranium 0 96 1
One 0 96 1
deal. 0 96 1

What 0 96 2
must 0 96 2
be 0 96 2
most 0 96 2
annoying 1 96 2
for 0 96 2
the 0 96 2
Clinton 0 96 2
team 0 96 2
is 0 96 2
that 0 96 2
these 0 96 2
investigations 0 96 2
all 0 96 2
started 0 96 2
as 0 96 2
a 0 96 2
way 0 96 2
to 0 96 2
undermine 0 96 2
the 0 96 2
Trump 0 96 2
administration 0 96 2
and 0 96 2
continue 0 96 2

between 0 96 2

Now, 0 96 3
more 0 96 3
than 0 96 3
a 0 96 3
year 0 96 3
after 0 96 3
the 0 96 3
investigations 0 96 3
began, 0 96 3
it’s 0 96 3
looking 0 96 3
less 0 96 3
likely 0 96 3
than 0 96 3
ever 0 96 3
that 0 96 3
President 0 96 3
Trump 0 96 3
did 0 96 3
anything 0 96 3
wrong… 0 96 3
but 0 96 3
the 0 96 3
investigations 0 96 3
seem 0 96 3
to 0 96 3
be 0 96 3
zeroing 0 96 3
in 0 96 3
on 0 96 3
key 0 96 3

an 0 96 5
attorney 0 96 5
representing 0 96 5
the 0 96 5
FBI 0 96 5

who 0 96 5
allegedly 0 96 5

to 0 96 5

interests 0 96 5
back 0 96 5
in 0 96 5
2010. 0 96 5

Now 0 96 6
that 0 96 6
the 0 96 6
NDA 0 96 6
(non 0 96 6
disclosure 0 96 6
agreement) 0 96 6
has 0 96 6

Circa’s 0 96 6

Carter 0 96 6
is 0 96 6
“reporting 0 96 6
that 0 96 6

Not 0 96 7
to 0 96 7
be 0 96 7
outdone, 0 96 7
the 0 96 7
Hill’s 0 96 7
John 0 96 7
Solomon 0 96 7
had 0 96 7
found 0 96 7

on 0 96 7
this 0 96 7

Apparently, 0 96 8
Solomon 0 96 8
has 0 96 8
learned 0 96 8
that 0 96 8

A 0 96 17

within 0 96 19
these 0 96 19

it’s 0 96 19
very 0 96 19

of 0 96 19

a 0 96 21
very 0 96 21
long 0 96 21

hard-hitting 0 96 21
piece 0 96 21
tonight 0 96 21
and 0 96 21
revealing 0 96 21
piece, 0 96 21
how 0 96 21
the 0 96 21
FBI 0 96 21

— 0 96 21
you 0 96 21
actually 0 96 21
said 0 96 21
six 0 96 21
years, 0 96 21
I 0 96 21
thought 0 96 21
he 0 96 21
was 0 96 21
only 0 96 21
an 0 96 21
informant 0 96 21
for 0 96 21
four 0 96 21

He 0 96 22
has 0 96 22
evidence, 0 96 22
was 0 96 22
on 0 96 22
the 0 96 22
inside, 0 96 22
directly 0 96 22
from 0 96 22
Putin’s 0 96 22

the 0 96 22

all 0 96 22
the 0 96 22

all 0 96 22

corroborating 0 96 22

even 0 96 22
further. 0 96 22

Go 0 96 23

JOHN 0 96 24
SOLOMON, 0 96 24
THE 0 96 24
HILL: 0 96 24
You 0 96 24
know, 0 96 24
Sara 0 96 24
just 0 96 24
said 0 96 24
something 0 96 24
about 0 96 24
the 0 96 24
importance 0 96 24
of 0 96 24
the 0 96 24
dominance 0 96 24
of 0 96 24
the 0 96 24
uranium 0 96 24
market. 0 96 24

This 0 96 25
is 0 96 25
an 0 96 25
email 0 96 25
that 0 96 25
the 0 96 25
FBI 0 96 25
has 0 96 25
had 0 96 25
for 0 96 25
six 0 96 25
years. 0 96 25

It 0 96 26
shows 0 96 26
that 0 96 26
uranium 0 96 26
one 0 96 26
was 0 96 26
part 0 96 26
of 0 96 26
a 0 96 26
Russia 0 96 26
strategy 0 96 26
to 0 96 26
control, 1 96 26
not 0 96 26
just 0 96 26
benefit 0 96 26
from 0 96 26
the 0 96 26
global 0 96 26
market, 0 96 26
controlled 1 96 26
the 0 96 26
global 0 96 26
market. 0 96 26

That 0 96 27
would 0 96 27
put 0 96 27
the 0 96 27
United 0 96 27
States 0 96 27
at 0 96 27
a 0 96 27
disadvantage. 0 96 27

That 0 96 28
is 0 96 28
the 0 96 28
sort 0 96 28
of 0 96 28
evidence 0 96 28
that 0 96 28
this 0 96 28
FBI 0 96 28
informant 0 96 28
has 0 96 28
right 0 96 28
now. 0 96 28

If 0 96 29
you 0 96 29
go 0 96 29
back 0 96 29
on 0 96 29
the 0 96 29
last 0 96 29
week 0 96 29
we 0 96 29
heard 0 96 29
several 0 96 29
things 0 96 29
from 0 96 29
the 0 96 29
Justice 0 96 29
Department, 0 96 29
there’s 0 96 29
no 0 96 29
connection 0 96 29
to 0 96 29
uranium 0 96 29
one. 0 96 29

These 0 96 30
are 0 96 30
emails 0 96 30
that 0 96 30
say 0 96 30
uranium 0 96 30
one 0 96 30
that 0 96 30
are 0 96 30
in 0 96 30
the 0 96 30
FBI 0 96 30
files. 0 96 30

They 0 96 31
said 0 96 31
that 0 96 31
there 0 96 31
was 0 96 31
no 0 96 31
connection 0 96 31
between 0 96 31
the 0 96 31
uranium 0 96 31
one 0 96 31
case 0 96 31
and 0 96 31
the 0 96 31
criminal 0 96 31
case. 0 96 31

We 0 96 32
now 0 96 32
know 0 96 32
the 0 96 32
criminal 0 96 32
case 0 96 32
got 0 96 32
its 0 96 32
first 0 96 32
evidence 0 96 32
in 0 96 32
2009, 0 96 32
a 0 96 32
whole 0 96 32
year 0 96 32
before 0 96 32
the 0 96 32
uranium 0 96 32
one 0 96 32
deal 0 96 32
was 0 96 32
approved 0 96 32
by 0 96 32
the 0 96 32
Obama 0 96 32
administration. 0 96 32

There 0 96 33
are 0 96 33
a 0 96 33
lot 0 96 33
of 0 96 33
things 0 96 33
that 0 96 33
people 0 96 33
have 0 96 33
been 0 96 33
saying 0 96 33
that 0 96 33
these 0 96 33
documents 0 96 33
simply 0 96 33
don’t 0 96 33
agree 0 96 33
with. 0 96 33

HANNITY: 0 96 34
All 0 96 34
right. 0 96 34

I 0 96 35
got 0 96 35
a 0 96 35
very 0 96 35
high 0 96 35
ranking 0 96 35
Congressman 0 96 35
and 0 96 35
that 0 96 35
knows, 0 96 35
let 0 96 35
us 0 96 35
put 0 96 35
it 0 96 35
that 0 96 35
way, 0 96 35
and 0 96 35
actually 0 96 35
sent 0 96 35
me 0 96 35
a 0 96 35
note. 0 96 35

The 0 96 36
knowledge 0 96 36
of 0 96 36
key 0 96 36
administration 0 96 36
officials 0 96 36
will 0 96 36
be 0 96 36
the 0 96 36
next 0 96 36
thing 0 96 36
proven 0 96 36
by 0 96 36
both 0 96 36
of 0 96 36
you, 0 96 36
and 0 96 36
the 0 96 36
links 0 96 36
to 0 96 36
the 0 96 36
Clinton 0 96 36
foundation. 0 96 36

Sara, 0 96 37
is 0 96 37
that 0 96 37
true? 0 96 37

CARTER: 0 96 38
I 0 96 38
believe 0 96 38
that 0 96 38
is 0 96 38
true. 0 96 38

I 0 96 39
mean 0 96 39
especially 0 96 39
when 0 96 39
we 0 96 39
at 0 96 39
— 0 96 39

HANNITY: 0 96 40
Do 0 96 40
believe 0 96 40
or 0 96 40
you 0 96 40
know? 0 96 40

I 0 96 41
can’t 0 96 41
ask 0 96 41
Victoria 0 96 41
that 0 96 41
question 0 96 41
because 0 96 41
she 0 96 41
won’t 0 96 41
tell 0 96 41
me. 0 96 41

CARTER: 0 96 42
I 0 96 42
know 0 96 42
it’s 0 96 42
true. 0 96 42

I 0 96 43
know 0 96 43
that 0 96 43
looking 0 96 43
at 0 96 43
these 0 96 43
documents 0 96 43
following 0 96 43
the 0 96 43
money, 0 96 43
following 0 96 43
the 0 96 43
money 0 96 43
is 0 96 43
what’s 0 96 43
important 0 96 43
here. 0 96 43

The 0 96 44
Justice 0 96 44
Department 0 96 44
has 0 96 44
not 0 96 44
pointed 0 96 44
out 0 96 44
that 0 96 44
they 0 96 44
will 0 96 44
possibly 0 96 44
call 0 96 44
a 0 96 44
special 0 96 44
counsel 0 96 44
to 0 96 44
this. 0 96 44

This 0 96 45
is 0 96 45
still 0 96 45
out 0 96 45
there. 0 96 45

They 0 96 46
are 0 96 46
looking 0 96 46
into 0 96 46
it. 0 96 46

That 0 96 47
is 0 96 47
something 0 96 47
that 0 96 47
they 0 96 47
need 0 96 47
to 0 96 47
decide. 0 96 47

But 0 96 48
whether 0 96 48
it’s 0 96 48
a 0 96 48
special 0 96 48
counsel 0 96 48
or 0 96 48
whether 0 96 48
it’s 0 96 48
a 0 96 48
prosecutor 0 96 48
that 0 96 48
is 0 96 48
investigating 0 96 48
this, 0 96 48
they 0 96 48
will 0 96 48
be 0 96 48
able 0 96 48
to 0 96 48
follow 0 96 48
the 0 96 48
money. 0 96 48

There 0 96 49
are 0 96 49
somethings 0 96 49
said 0 96 49
… 0 96 49

HANNITY: 0 96 50
When 0 96 50
you 0 96 50
say 0 96 50
follow 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
money, 0 96 50
my 0 96 50
suspicion 0 96 50
would 0 96 50
go 0 96 50
to 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
money 0 96 50
came 0 96 50
directly 0 96 50
from 0 96 50
Russia, 0 96 50
was 0 96 50
funneled 0 96 50
through 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
Canadian 0 96 50
donors 0 96 50
to 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
Clinton 0 96 50
Foundation. 0 96 50

How 0 96 51
good 0 96 51
are 0 96 51
my 0 96 51
instincts? 0 96 51

CARTER: 0 96 52
You 0 96 52
have 0 96 52
pretty 0 96 52
good 0 96 52
instincts. 0 96 52

I 0 96 53
think 0 96 53
there’s 0 96 53
a 0 96 53
lot 0 96 53
of 0 96 53
other 0 96 53
areas 0 96 53
that 0 96 53
they 0 96 53
will 0 96 53
be 0 96 53
looking 0 96 53
at 0 96 53
as 0 96 53
well. 0 96 53

Remember 0 96 54
this 0 96 54
is 0 96 54
like 0 96 54
peeling 0 96 54
back 0 96 54
an 0 96 54
onion. 0 96 54

You 0 96 55
peel 0 96 55
one 0 96 55
part 0 96 55
and 0 96 55
then 0 96 55
you 0 96 55
find 0 96 55
another 0 96 55
part. 0 96 55

And 0 96 56
that 0 96 56
is 0 96 56
what’s 0 96 56
going 0 96 56
to 0 96 56
require 0 96 56
somebody 0 96 56
to 0 96 56
do 0 96 56
an 0 96 56
extensive 0 96 56
investigation. 0 96 56

HANNITY: 0 96 57
But 0 96 57
it 0 96 57
is 0 96 57
beginning 0 96 57
to 0 96 57
cascade 0 96 57
Sara. 0 96 57

CARTER: 0 96 58
It 0 96 58
is. 0 96 58

HANNITY: 0 96 59
John, 0 96 59
I 0 96 59
want 0 96 59
her 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
respond 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
same 0 96 59
thing, 0 96 59
that 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
Clinton 0 96 59
Foundation, 0 96 59
that 0 96 59
this 0 96 59
will 0 96 59
be 0 96 59
traced 0 96 59
back 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
high-ranking 0 96 59
Obama 0 96 59
administration 0 96 59
officials 0 96 59
and 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
Clinton 0 96 59
Foundation, 0 96 59
and 0 96 59
if 0 96 59
you 0 96 59
add 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
money 0 96 59
portion 0 96 59
Sara 0 96 59
mentioned? 0 96 59

SOLOMON: 0 96 60
I 0 96 60
do. 0 96 60

I 0 96 61
think 0 96 61
the 0 96 61
place 0 96 61
we 0 96 61
will 0 96 61
be 0 96 61
talking 0 96 61
about 0 96 61
in 0 96 61
the 0 96 61
next 0 96 61
couple 0 96 61
weeks 0 96 61
as 0 96 61
the 0 96 61
Clinton 0 96 61
global 0 96 61
initiative. 0 96 61

Sort 0 96 62
of 0 96 62
a 0 96 62
side 0 96 62
project 0 96 62
of 0 96 62
the 0 96 62
Clinton 0 96 62
Foundation. 0 96 62

There 0 96 63
are 0 96 63
new 0 96 63
flows 0 96 63
of 0 96 63
money 0 96 63
there 0 96 63
that 0 96 63
we 0 96 63
will 0 96 63
report 0 96 63
on 0 96 63
then 0 96 63
the 0 96 63
next 0 96 63
couple 0 96 63
of 0 96 63
weeks. 0 96 63

There 0 96 64
were 0 96 64
also 0 96 64
some 0 96 64
personal 0 96 64
business 0 96 64
projects, 0 96 64
some 0 96 64
very 0 96 64
senior 0 96 64
Clinton 0 96 64
people 0 96 64
that 0 96 64
got 0 96 64
a 0 96 64
remarkable 1 96 64
infusion 0 96 64
of 0 96 64
cash 0 96 64
from 0 96 64
Russia. 0 96 64

It 0 96 65
will 0 96 65
be 0 96 65
able 0 96 65
to 0 96 65
talk 0 96 65
about 0 96 65
that 0 96 65
in 0 96 65
the 0 96 65
next 0 96 65
couple 0 96 65
of 0 96 65
weeks. 0 96 65

Another 0 96 66
layer 0 96 66
of 0 96 66
interest 0 96 66
of 0 96 66
the 0 96 66
story. 0 96 66

HANNITY: 0 96 67
All 0 96 67
right. 0 96 67

We 0 96 68
have 0 96 68
a 0 96 68
lot 0 96 68
of 0 96 68
time 0 96 68
in 0 96 68
the 0 96 68
segment 0 96 68
so 0 96 68
I 0 96 68
want 0 96 68
to 0 96 68
go 0 96 68
very 0 96 68
slowly 0 96 68
here. 0 96 68

Both 0 96 69
of 0 96 69
you, 0 96 69
before 0 96 69
I 0 96 69
get 0 96 69
to 0 96 69
Victoria, 0 96 69
Sara 0 96 69
and 0 96 69
John, 0 96 69
you 0 96 69
both 0 96 69
in 0 96 69
your 0 96 69
pieces 0 96 69
said 0 96 69
5,000 0 96 69
documents. 0 96 69

I 0 96 70
hear 0 96 70
the 0 96 70
number 0 96 70
the 0 96 70
FBI 0 96 70
informant 0 96 70
is 0 96 70
much, 0 96 70
much 0 96 70
greater, 0 96 70
tens 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
thousands. 0 96 70

True 0 96 71
or 0 96 71
false? 0 96 71

SOLOMON: 0 96 72
That 0 96 72
seems 0 96 72
to 0 96 72
be 0 96 72
accurate. 0 96 72

We 0 96 73
have 0 96 73
a 0 96 73
subset 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
the 0 96 73
documents 0 96 73
and 0 96 73
they 0 96 73
are 0 96 73
very 0 96 73
voluminous. 0 96 73

HANNITY: 0 96 74
Now 0 96 74
let 0 96 74
me 0 96 74
go 0 96 74
to 0 96 74
Victoria. 0 96 74

One 0 96 75
of 0 96 75
the 0 96 75
great 0 96 75
attorneys. 0 96 75

She 0 96 76
is 0 96 76
the 0 96 76
most 0 96 76
difficult 0 96 76
to 0 96 76
get 0 96 76
any 0 96 76
information 0 96 76
out 0 96 76
of. 0 96 76

Victoria, 0 96 77
one 0 96 77
of 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
things 0 96 77
I’ve 0 96 77
known 0 96 77
about 0 96 77
you, 0 96 77
and 0 96 77
I’ve 0 96 77
interviewed 0 96 77
you 0 96 77
so 0 96 77
many 0 96 77
times 0 96 77
over 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
years, 0 96 77
you 0 96 77
now 0 96 77
have 0 96 77
been 0 96 77
doing 0 96 77
a 0 96 77
deep 0 96 77
dive 0 96 77
into 0 96 77
all 0 96 77
of 0 96 77
this. 0 96 77

You 0 96 78
are 0 96 78
now 0 96 78
representing 0 96 78
this 0 96 78
FBI 0 96 78
informant. 0 96 78

I 0 96 79
think 0 96 79
they 0 96 79
will 0 96 79
become 0 96 79
an 0 96 79
American 1 96 79
hero 1 96 79
out 0 96 79
of 0 96 79
all 0 96 79
of 0 96 79
this, 0 96 79
but 0 96 79
apparently, 0 96 79
he 0 96 79
was 0 96 79
fighting 0 96 79
and 0 96 79
begging 0 96 79
and 0 96 79
pleading 0 96 79
and 0 96 79
saying 0 96 79
the 0 96 79
Russians 0 96 79
are 0 96 79
here, 0 96 79
they 0 96 79
are 0 96 79
doing 0 96 79
this, 0 96 79
why 0 96 79
are 0 96 79
you 0 96 79
paying 0 96 79
attention? 0 96 79

I 0 96 80
hope 0 96 80
my 0 96 80
instincts 0 96 80
are 0 96 80
right 0 96 80
there, 0 96 80
and 0 96 80
number 0 96 80
two, 0 96 80
how 0 96 80
devastating 1 96 80
it 0 96 80
legally 0 96 80
is 0 96 80
this 0 96 80
going 0 96 80
to 0 96 80
be 0 96 80
based 0 96 80
on 0 96 80
what 0 96 80
I 0 96 80
was 0 96 80
just 0 96 80
asking 0 96 80
Sara 0 96 80
and 0 96 80
John 0 96 80
about 0 96 80
impacting 0 96 80
former 0 96 80
Obama 0 96 80
officials, 0 96 80
money, 0 96 80
Clinton 0 96 80
foundation? 0 96 80

VICTORIA 0 96 81
TOENSING, 0 96 81
ATTORNEY 0 96 81
REPRESENTING 0 96 81
FBI 0 96 81
INFORMANT: 0 96 81
Let 0 96 81
me 0 96 81
go 0 96 81
to 0 96 81
number 0 96 81
one 0 96 81
first, 0 96 81
that 0 96 81
is 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
whole 0 96 81
essence 0 96 81
of 0 96 81
what 0 96 81
John 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
Sara 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
I 0 96 81
are 0 96 81
talking 0 96 81
about 0 96 81
is 0 96 81
that 0 96 81
in 0 96 81
2009, 0 96 81
2010, 0 96 81
our 0 96 81
FBI 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
presumably 0 96 81
our 0 96 81
Justice 0 96 81
Department, 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
White 0 96 81
House, 0 96 81
as 0 96 81
my 0 96 81
client 0 96 81
was 0 96 81
told, 0 96 81
all 0 96 81
knew 0 96 81
about 0 96 81
this 0 96 81
corruption 0 96 81
in 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
Russian 0 96 81
nuclear 0 96 81
energy 0 96 81
area. 0 96 81

There’s 0 96 82
no 0 96 82
separate 0 96 82
companies. 0 96 82

They 0 96 83
are 0 96 83
all 0 96 83
related. 0 96 83

The 0 96 84
Russian 0 96 84
nuclear 0 96 84
energy 0 96 84
is 0 96 84
controlled 1 96 84
from 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
top, 0 96 84
from 0 96 84
Putin. 0 96 84

They 0 96 85
are 0 96 85
all 0 96 85
one. 0 96 85

They 0 96 86
all 0 96 86
talk 0 96 86
to 0 96 86
each 0 96 86
other. 0 96 86

So 0 96 87
the 0 96 87
evidence 0 96 87
about 0 96 87
this 0 96 87
corruption 0 96 87
was 0 96 87
known 0 96 87
to 0 96 87
our 0 96 87
government 0 96 87
in 0 96 87
2009, 0 96 87
2010, 0 96 87
and 0 96 87
why 0 96 87
is 0 96 87
it 0 96 87
that 0 96 87
CFIUS 0 96 87
either 0 96 87
wasn’t 0 96 87
told, 0 96 87
or 0 96 87
CFIUS 0 96 87
people 0 96 87
knowing 0 96 87
about 0 96 87
it 0 96 87
— 0 96 87

HANNITY: 0 96 88
Explain 0 96 88
CFIUS, 0 96 88
13 0 96 88
agencies, 0 96 88
I 0 96 88
am 0 96 88
sorry 0 96 88
9 0 96 88
agencies 0 96 88
approving 0 96 88
the 0 96 88
deal 0 96 88
that 0 96 88
gave 0 96 88
control 1 96 88
of 0 96 88
uranium 0 96 88
one 0 96 88
to 0 96 88
the 0 96 88
bad 1 96 88
actor, 1 96 88
hostile 1 96 88
regime, 1 96 88
Putin 0 96 88
Russia. 0 96 88

TOENSING: 0 96 89
They 0 96 89
said, 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
CFIUS 0 96 89
board 0 96 89
said 0 96 89
that 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
bad 1 96 89
Russians 0 96 89
could 0 96 89
buy 0 96 89
uranium 0 96 89
one, 0 96 89
which 0 96 89
contains 0 96 89
access 0 96 89
to 0 96 89
20 0 96 89
percent 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
U.S. 0 96 89

Uranium, 0 96 90
why 0 96 90
was 0 96 90
that 0 96 90
decision 0 96 90
made? 0 96 90

Was 0 96 91
CFIUS 0 96 91
told? 0 96 91

Did 0 96 92
Bob 0 96 92
Mueller 0 96 92
go 0 96 92
to 0 96 92
Eric 0 96 92
Holder 0 96 92
and 0 96 92
tell 0 96 92
him? 0 96 92

Eric 0 96 93
Holder 0 96 93
sat 0 96 93
on 0 96 93
it. 0 96 93

HANNITY: 0 96 94
He 0 96 94
was 0 96 94
one 0 96 94
of 0 96 94
the 0 96 94
nine. 0 96 94

TOENSING: 0 96 95
Did 0 96 95
Bob 0 96 95
Mueller 0 96 95
go 0 96 95
to 0 96 95
the 0 96 95
White 0 96 95
House 0 96 95
and 0 96 95
tell 0 96 95
him? 0 96 95

The 0 96 96
FBI 0 96 96
agents 0 96 96
told 0 96 96
my 0 96 96
client 0 96 96
that 0 96 96
they 0 96 96
were 0 96 96
briefing 0 96 96
the 0 96 96
President 0 96 96
about 0 96 96
his 0 96 96
conduct. 0 96 96

Of 0 96 97
course, 0 96 97
when 0 96 97
the 0 96 97
CFIUS 0 96 97
decision 0 96 97
was 0 96 97
made. 0 96 97

My 0 96 98
client 0 96 98
said, 0 96 98
what 0 96 98
happened? 0 96 98

HANNITY: 0 96 99
Back 0 96 99
to 0 96 99
my 0 96 99
original 0 96 99
question, 0 96 99
counselor, 0 96 99
if 0 96 99
I 0 96 99
may. 0 96 99

You 0 96 100
are 0 96 100
too 0 96 100
good 0 96 100
at 0 96 100
your 0 96 100
job. 0 96 100

This 0 96 101
is 0 96 101
a 0 96 101
very 0 96 101
serious 0 96 101
point. 0 96 101

Putting 0 96 102
your 0 96 102
legal 0 96 102
hat 0 96 102
on, 0 96 102
objectively 0 96 102
speaking, 0 96 102
yes 0 96 102
they 0 96 102
knew, 0 96 102
the 0 96 102
evidence 0 96 102
will 0 96 102
prove 0 96 102
it 0 96 102
based 0 96 102
on 0 96 102
the 0 96 102
documents 0 96 102
and 0 96 102
your 0 96 102
client, 0 96 102
crimes 0 96 102
committed 0 96 102
on 0 96 102
a 0 96 102
high 0 96 102
level? 0 96 102

National 0 96 103
security 0 96 103
compromise? 0 96 103

TOENSING: 0 96 104
Of 0 96 104
course, 0 96 104
it 0 96 104
goes 0 96 104
without 0 96 104
saying 0 96 104
giving 0 96 104
the 0 96 104
Russians 0 96 104
control 1 96 104
of 0 96 104
the 0 96 104
uranium 0 96 104
was 0 96 104
a 0 96 104
national 0 96 104
security 0 96 104
compromise. 0 96 104

I 0 96 105
think 0 96 105
that 0 96 105
we 0 96 105
are 0 96 105
going 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
have 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
do 0 96 105
is 0 96 105
continue 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
follow 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
money 0 96 105
because 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
reporting 0 96 105
that 0 96 105
John 0 96 105
and 0 96 105
Sara 0 96 105
are 0 96 105
going 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
be 0 96 105
doing 0 96 105
in 0 96 105
a 0 96 105
few 0 96 105
days 0 96 105
will 0 96 105
be 0 96 105
revealing 0 96 105
about 0 96 105
where 0 96 105
lots 0 96 105
of 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
various 0 96 105
money 0 96 105
went 0 96 105
and 0 96 105
where 0 96 105
it 0 96 105
came 0 96 105
from. 0 96 105

HANNITY: 0 96 106
Always 0 96 106
we 0 96 106
go 0 96 106
back, 0 96 106
and 0 96 106
I 0 96 106
believe 0 96 106
at 0 96 106
the 0 96 106
end 0 96 106
of 0 96 106
this 0 96 106
you 0 96 106
guys 0 96 106
deserve 0 96 106
a 0 96 106
Pulitzer, 0 96 106
and 0 96 106
I’m 0 96 106
not 0 96 106
the 0 96 106
only 0 96 106
one 0 96 106
thinking 0 96 106
that. 0 96 106

You 0 96 107
have 0 96 107
dug 0 96 107
so 0 96 107
deep 0 96 107
on 0 96 107
this, 0 96 107
this 0 96 107
has 0 96 107
been 0 96 107
a 0 96 107
deep 0 96 107
dive 0 96 107
and 0 96 107
I 0 96 107
applaud 0 96 107
you 0 96 107
both. 0 96 107

I 0 96 108
want 0 96 108
to 0 96 108
ask 0 96 108
as 0 96 108
it 0 96 108
relates 0 96 108
to 0 96 108
who 0 96 108
knew 0 96 108
what, 0 96 108
and 0 96 108
when. 0 96 108

What 0 96 109
did 0 96 109
they 0 96 109
know, 0 96 109
when 0 96 109
did 0 96 109
they 0 96 109
know 0 96 109
it, 0 96 109
John 0 96 109
Solomon? 0 96 109

I’m 0 96 110
talking 0 96 110
about 0 96 110
Obama, 0 96 110
Mueller, 0 96 110
Eric 0 96 110
Holder, 0 96 110
and 0 96 110
Hillary 0 96 110
Clinton. 0 96 110

SOLOMON: 0 96 111
We 0 96 111
are 0 96 111
at 0 96 111
a 0 96 111
little 0 96 111
disadvantage 0 96 111
right 0 96 111
now, 0 96 111
because 0 96 111
we 0 96 111
don’t 0 96 111
have 0 96 111
those 0 96 111
records, 0 96 111
and 0 96 111
also 0 96 111
the 0 96 111
records 0 96 111
that 0 96 111
Congress 0 96 111
needs 0 96 111
to 0 96 111
go 0 96 111
get, 0 96 111
but 0 96 111
I 0 96 111
can 0 96 111
tell 0 96 111
you 0 96 111
I 0 96 111
have 0 96 111
a 0 96 111
person 0 96 111
quoted 0 96 111
in 0 96 111
my 0 96 111

This 0 96 112

said 0 96 112
without 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
shred 1 96 112

we 0 96 112

in 0 96 112
2009 0 96 112
a 0 96 112

that 0 96 112

of 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
doubt, 1 96 112
we 0 96 112
knew 0 96 112
that 0 96 112
Russia 0 96 112
was 0 96 112
trying 0 96 112

without 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
doubt 1 96 112
we 0 96 112
knew 0 96 112
they 0 96 112
were 0 96 112
using 0 96 112
political 0 96 112

to 0 96 112

to 0 96 112

their 0 96 112

here. 0 96 112

We 0 96 113
are 0 96 113
talking 0 96 113
about 0 96 113
control, 1 96 113
like 0 96 113
this 0 96 113
document 0 96 113
says, 0 96 113
they 0 96 113
are 0 96 113

to 0 96 113
gain 0 96 113

That 0 96 114

national 1 96 114

HANNITY: 0 96 115
President 0 96 115
daily 0 96 115

were 0 96 115
told. 0 96 115

Had 0 96 116

in 0 96 116
it 0 96 116

this. 0 96 116

CARTER: 0 96 117
Sean. 0 96 117

That 0 96 118
is 0 96 118
what 0 96 118
we 0 96 118
need 0 96 118
to 0 96 118
find 0 96 118
out. 0 96 118

We 0 96 119
need 0 96 119
to 0 96 119
see 0 96 119
those 0 96 119
Presidential 0 96 119
daily 0 96 119
briefings. 0 96 119

Congress 0 96 120
can 0 96 120
get 0 96 120
those. 0 96 120

They 0 96 121
will 0 96 121
be 0 96 121
able 0 96 121
to 0 96 121
know 0 96 121
whether 0 96 121
or 0 96 121
not 0 96 121
President 0 96 121
Obama 0 96 121
was 0 96 121
briefed 0 96 121
on 0 96 121
this 0 96 121
and 0 96 121
according 0 96 121
to 0 96 121
a 0 96 121
number 0 96 121
of 0 96 121
people 0 96 121
that 0 96 121
I 0 96 121
have 0 96 121
spoken 0 96 121
with 0 96 121
as 0 96 121
well, 0 96 121
he 0 96 121
was. 0 96 121

I 0 96 122
think 0 96 122
that 0 96 122
will 0 96 122
reveal 0 96 122
a 0 96 122
whole 0 96 122
other 0 96 122
layer 0 96 122
of 0 96 122
who 0 96 122
knew 0 96 122
what, 0 96 122
where 0 96 122
and 0 96 122
when. 0 96 122

And 0 96 123
we 0 96 123
follow 0 96 123
the 0 96 123
money 0 96 123
and 0 96 123
it 0 96 123
will 0 96 123
reveal 0 96 123
even 0 96 123
more 0 96 123
about 0 96 123
Hillary 0 96 123
Clinton 0 96 123
and 0 96 123
what 0 96 123
she 0 96 123
knew 0 96 123
and 0 96 123
when 0 96 123
did 0 96 123
she 0 96 123
know 0 96 123
it, 0 96 123
and 0 96 123
the 0 96 123
other 0 96 123
members 0 96 123
of 0 96 123
the 0 96 123
CFIUS 0 96 123

HANNITY: 0 96 124
And 0 96 124
Obama 0 96 124
and 0 96 124
Holder 0 96 124
and 0 96 124
Mueller? 0 96 124

John, 0 96 125
real 0 96 125
quick, 0 96 125
we 0 96 125
are 0 96 125
running 0 96 125
out 0 96 125
of 0 96 125
time. 0 96 125

SOLOMON: 0 96 126
yes 0 96 126
listen, 0 96 126
I 0 96 126
think 0 96 126
even 0 96 126
Sessions 0 96 126
and 0 96 126
Rosenstein 0 96 126
have 0 96 126
questions 0 96 126
to 0 96 126
answer. 0 96 126

There 0 96 127
are 0 96 127
people 0 96 127
in 0 96 127
Congress 0 96 127
who 0 96 127
don’t 0 96 127
think 0 96 127
they’ve 0 96 127
gotten 0 96 127
a 0 96 127
straight 0 96 127
answer 0 96 127
from 0 96 127
them. 0 96 127

HANNITY: 0 96 128
All 0 96 128
right. 0 96 128

Victoria, 0 96 129
we 0 96 129
get 0 96 129
the 0 96 129
last 0 96 129
word 0 96 129
from 0 96 129
you, 0 96 129
laws 0 96 129
broken? 0 96 129

TOENSING: 0 96 130
Well, 0 96 130
of 0 96 130
course. 0 96 130

HANNITY: 0 96 131
You 0 96 131
are 0 96 131
so 0 96 131
good 0 96 131
at 0 96 131
your 0 96 131
job. 0 96 131

You 0 96 132
are 0 96 132
so 0 96 132
annoyingly 0 96 132
good. 0 96 132

The 0 96 133
American 1 96 133
people 1 96 133
deserve 0 96 133
the 0 96 133
truth 0 96 133
varied 0 96 133
our 0 96 133
security 0 96 133
was 0 96 133
compromised, 0 96 133
we 0 96 133
import 0 96 133
uranium, 0 96 133
because 0 96 133
we 0 96 133
don’t 0 96 133
have 0 96 133
enough. 0 96 133

Newt 0 96 134
Gingrich 0 96 134
will 0 96 134
weigh 0 96 134
in 0 96 134
on 0 96 134
this 0 96 134
and 0 96 134
more 0 96 134
things 0 96 134
and 0 96 134
about 0 96 134
the 0 96 134

Are 0 96 135
they 0 96 135
facing 0 96 135
their 0 96 135
day 0 96 135

And 0 96 136
a 0 96 136

A 0 248 1
rough 0 248 1
patch—or 0 248 1
a 0 248 1
double-dip 0 248 1
recession? 0 248 1

Economists 0 248 2
are 0 248 2
increasingly 1 248 2
befuddled 1 248 2
at 0 248 2
what 0 248 2
awaits 0 248 2
the 0 248 2
once-great 0 248 2
U.S. 0 248 2
economy. 0 248 2

And 0 248 3
Wall 0 248 3
Street 0 248 3
is 0 248 3
plainly 0 248 3
beginning 0 248 3
to 0 248 3
panic. 0 248 3

Unemployment 0 248 4
is 0 248 4
a 0 248 4
case 0 248 4
in 0 248 4
point. 0 248 4

It 0 248 5
now 0 248 5
seems 0 248 5
obvious 0 248 5
that 0 248 5
one 0 248 5
of 0 248 5
those 0 248 5
mysterious 1 248 5
memos 1 248 5
has 0 248 5
gone 0 248 5
out 0 248 5
to 0 248 5
the 0 248 5
Main 0 248 5
Stream 0 248 5
Media 0 248 5
saying 0 248 5
that 0 248 5
no-one 0 248 5
can 0 248 5
mention 0 248 5
the 0 248 5
immigration 0 248 5
moratorium 0 248 5
solution. 0 248 5

But 0 248 6
unemployment 0 248 6
is 0 248 6
befuddling 0 248 6
anyway. 0 248 6

Just 0 248 7
a 0 248 7
few 0 248 7
weeks 0 248 7
ago 0 248 7
professional 0 248 7
prognosticators 0 248 7
were 0 248 7
expecting 0 248 7
job 0 248 7
growth 0 248 7
of 0 248 7
175,000 0 248 7
in 0 248 7

However, 0 248 8
nonfarm 0 248 8
payroll 0 248 8
growth 0 248 8
came 0 248 8
in 0 248 8
at 0 248 8
54,000 0 248 8
in 0 248 8
May, 0 248 8
the 0 248 8
smallest 0 248 8
gain 0 248 8
since 0 248 8
September, 0 248 8
and 0 248 8
a 0 248 8
fraction 0 248 8

just 0 248 8

VDARE.com 0 248 10
has 0 248 10
long 0 248 10
argued 0 248 10
that 0 248 10
the 0 248 10
household 0 248 10
survey 0 248 10
captures 0 248 10
the 0 248 10
employment 0 248 10
of 0 248 10
illegal 0 248 10

additionally, 0 248 10
it 0 248 10
actually 0 248 10
mentions 0 248 10
ethnicity. 0 248 10

In 0 248 11
May, 0 248 11
according 0 248 11
to 0 248 11
the 0 248 11
Household 0 248 11
Survey, 0 248 11
total 0 248 11

rose 0 248 11
by 0 248 11
105,000. 0 248 11

Non-Hispanics 0 248 12
actually 0 248 12
gained 0 248 12
ground: 0 248 12

Total 0 248 13

up 0 248 13
105,000 0 248 13

to 0 248 16
126.2 0 248 16

is 0 248 17
atypical 0 248 17

Non-Hispanics 0 248 18
have 0 248 18
lost 0 248 18

at 0 248 18
twice 0 248 18

Step 0 248 20
back 0 248 20
further 0 248 20
and 0 248 20
the 1 248 20
picture 1 248 20
is 1 248 20
still 1 248 20
bleaker. 1 248 20

Since 0 248 21
January 0 248 21
2001 0 248 21
the 0 248 21

1.9 0 248 21
million, 0 248 21
or 0 248 21
by 0 248 21
-1.6%. 0 248 21

Over 0 248 22
that 0 248 22
same 0 248 22

a 0 248 22

put, 1 248 23
the 1 248 23

investigation. 0 74 6

One 0 74 7
source 0 74 7
is 0 74 7
Paul 0 74 7
Ryan: 0 74 7
Evidence: 0 74 7
“House 0 74 7
Speaker 0 74 7
Paul 0 74 7
Ryan 0 74 7
said 0 74 7
Wednesday 0 74 7
that 0 74 7
Oversight 0 74 7
Chairman 0 74 7
Trey 0 74 7
Gowdy 0 74 7
was 0 74 7
‘accurate’ 0 74 7
when 0 74 7
he 0 74 7
argued 0 74 7
the 0 74 7
FBI 0 74 7
has 0 74 7
acted 0 74 7
appropriately 0 74 7
in 0 74 7
its 0 74 7
ongoing 0 74 7
probe 0 74 7
of 0 74 7
potential 0 74 7
Russian 0 74 7
links 0 74 7
to 0 74 7
the 0 74 7
Trump 0 74 7
campaign.” 0 74 7
How 1 74 7
could 1 74 7
Ryan 1 74 7
possibly 1 74 7
know 1 74 7
this? 1 74 7

Isn’t 1 74 8
he 1 74 8
prejudging 1 74 8
the 1 74 8
case 1 74 8
without 1 74 8
even 1 74 8
finding 1 74 8
out 1 74 8
what 1 74 8
actually 1 74 8
happened? 1 74 8

If 0 74 9
Ryan 0 74 9
is 0 74 9
correct, 0 74 9
an 0 74 9
investigation 0 74 9
will 0 74 9
show 0 74 9
it; 0 74 9
but 0 74 9
the 0 74 9
current 0 74 9
evidence 0 74 9
suggests 0 74 9
he 0 74 9
is 0 74 9
wrong. 0 74 9

By 0 74 10
short-circuiting 0 74 10
the 0 74 10
investigation, 0 74 10
Ryan 0 74 10
is 0 74 10
betraying 1 74 10
the 1 74 10
interest 1 74 10
of 1 74 10
the 1 74 10
American 1 74 10
people 1 74 10
to 0 74 10
learn 0 74 10
what 0 74 10
the 0 74 10
FBI 0 74 10
and 0 74 10
CIA 0 74 10
actually 0 74 10
did 0 74 10
against 0 74 10
Trump. 0 74 10

Another 0 74 11
Republican 0 74 11
who 0 74 11
wants 0 74 11
to 0 74 11
stop 0 74 11
investigating 0 74 11
is 0 74 11
former 0 74 11
RNC 0 74 11
Chair, 0 74 11
Michael 0 74 11
Steele: 0 74 11
“There 0 74 11
is 0 74 11
no 0 74 11
Spygate 0 74 11
because 0 74 11
there 0 74 11
are 0 74 11
no 0 74 11
spies 0 74 11
in 0 74 11
the 0 74 11
campaign.” 0 74 11
The 0 74 11
attitude 0 74 11
of 0 74 11
Steve 0 74 11
Scalise 0 74 11
is 0 74 11
wishy-washy. 1 74 11

He’s 0 74 12
open 0 74 12
to 0 74 12
a 0 74 12
special 0 74 12
prosecutor, 0 74 12
but 0 74 12
his 0 74 12
responses 0 74 12
come 0 74 12
across 0 74 12
as 0 74 12
passive, 0 74 12
lacking 1 74 12
push, 1 74 12
zeal 1 74 12
and 1 74 12
enthusiasm 1 74 12
to 0 74 12
delve 0 74 12
deeply 0 74 12
into 0 74 12
Spygate. 0 74 12

There 0 74 13
is 0 74 13
a 0 74 13
kind 0 74 13
of 0 74 13
coverup 0 74 13
at 0 74 13
work 0 74 13
here 0 74 13
in 0 74 13
which 0 74 13
important 0 74 13
Republicans 0 74 13
do 0 74 13
not 0 74 13
want 0 74 13
to 0 74 13
bolster 0 74 13
Trump 0 74 13
by 0 74 13
adding 0 74 13
substance 0 74 13
to 0 74 13
Spygate, 0 74 13
and 0 74 13
they 0 74 13
do 0 74 13
not 0 74 13
want 0 74 13
to 0 74 13
clean 0 74 13
up 0 74 13
the 0 74 13
FBI 0 74 13
by 0 74 13
aggressively 0 74 13
investigating 0 74 13
Spygate 0 74 13
further. 0 74 13

They 0 74 14
don’t 0 74 14
want 0 74 14
the 1 74 14
rotten 1 74 14
inner 1 74 14
workings 1 74 14
of 0 74 14
the 0 74 14
organization 0 74 14
to 0 74 14
be 0 74 14
aired 0 74 14
publicly. 0 74 14

They 1 74 15
want 1 74 15
to 1 74 15
preserve 1 74 15
the 1 74 15
FBI’s 1 74 15
reputation. 1 74 15

They 1 74 16
don’t 1 74 16
care 1 74 16
to 1 74 16
see 1 74 16
Trump 1 74 16
vindicated. 1 74 16

The 0 74 17
contrast 0 74 17
with 0 74 17
the 0 74 17
Watergate 0 74 17
investigation 0 74 17

us: 0 265 2

What 0 265 3
did 0 265 3
the 0 265 3
scripture 0 265 3
of 0 265 3
Islam 0 265 3
tell 0 265 3
me 0 265 3
about 0 265 3
the 1 265 3
duty 1 265 3
to 1 265 3
kill 1 265 3
infidels? 1 265 3

Some 0 265 4
people 0 265 4
are 0 265 4
sure 0 265 4
it 0 265 4
is 0 265 4
there, 0 265 4
though 0 265 4
it 0 265 4
isn’t. 0 265 4

Then 0 265 5
what 0 265 5
does 0 265 5
it 0 265 5
say 0 265 5
about 0 265 5

Not 0 265 6
a 0 265 6
thing 0 265 6
(p. 0 265 6
7). 0 265 6

That 1 265 7
would 1 265 7
be 1 265 7
good 1 265 7
to 1 265 7
know, 1 265 7
were 1 265 7
Wills 1 265 7
a 1 265 7
reliable 1 265 7
witness. 1 265 7

Unfortunately, 1 265 8
he 1 265 8
proves 1 265 8
to 1 265 8
be 1 265 8
just 1 265 8
the 1 265 8
opposite: 1 265 8
Wills 0 265 8

I 0 265 9
have 0 265 9
never 0 265 9
called 0 265 9

such 0 265 9

Wills, 1 265 10
not 1 265 10
surprisingly, 1 265 10
does 1 265 10
not 1 265 10
offer 1 265 10
any 1 265 10
quotation 1 265 10

back 1 265 10
up 1 265 10
his 1 265 10
false 1 265 10
claim. 1 265 10

His 0 265 11
manifest 0 265 11
unreliability 0 265 11
on 0 265 11
this 0 265 11
point 0 265 11
casts 0 265 11
a 0 265 11
shadow 0 265 11
on 0 265 11
his 0 265 11
primary 0 265 11
assertions 0 265 11
about 0 265 11
the 0 265 11
Qur’an. 0 265 11

Wills 0 265 12
seems 0 265 12
determined 0 265 12
to 0 265 12
put 0 265 12
the 1 265 12
best 1 265 12
possible 1 265 12
face 1 265 12
on 1 265 12
the 1 265 12
Qur’an, 1 265 12
which 0 265 12
requires 0 265 12
him 0 265 12
to 0 265 12
ignore 0 265 12
a 0 265 12
great 0 265 12
deal 0 265 12
of 0 265 12
Qur’anic 0 265 12
incitement 1 265 12
and 1 265 12
hatred. 1 265 12

For 0 265 13
example, 0 265 13
he 0 265 13
quotes 0 265 13
5:51 0 265 13
-- 0 265 13
“You 0 265 13
who 0 265 13
believe, 0 265 13
do 0 265 13
not 0 265 13
take 0 265 13
the 0 265 13
Jews 0 265 13
and 0 265 13

as 0 265 13
allies” 0 265 13
(p. 0 265 13
114) 0 265 13
-- 0 265 13
but 0 265 13
he 0 265 13
nonetheless 0 265 13
concludes, 0 265 13
after 0 265 13
ten 0 265 13
pages 0 265 13
of 0 265 13
tu 1 265 13
quoque 1 265 13
arguments 1 265 13
and 0 265 13
other 0 265 13
legerdemain, 1 265 13
that 0 265 13
“the 0 265 13
Qur’an 0 265 13
is 0 265 13
fraternal 0 265 13

treatment 0 265 13
of 0 265 13
other 0 265 13
faiths” 0 265 13
(p. 0 265 13
124). 0 265 13

Wills 1 265 14
never 1 265 14
mentions 1 265 14
Qur’an 1 265 14
9:29, 1 265 14
which 1 265 14
commands 1 265 14
Muslims 1 265 14
to 1 265 14
wage 1 265 14
war 1 265 14
against 1 265 14
Jews 1 265 14
and 1 265 14
Christians 1 265 14
and 1 265 14
subjugate 1 265 14
them 1 265 14
as 1 265 14
inferiors 1 265 14
under 1 265 14
the 1 265 14
rule 1 265 14
of 1 265 14
Sharia. 1 265 14

Wills 1 265 15
is 1 265 15
no 1 265 15
more 1 265 15
trustworthy 1 265 15
when 1 265 15
he 1 265 15
deals 1 265 15
with 1 265 15
the 1 265 15
question 1 265 15
of 1 265 15
violence 1 265 15
in 1 265 15
the 1 265 15
Qur’an. 1 265 15

He 0 265 16
renders 0 265 16
one 0 265 16
key 0 265 16
passage 0 265 16
in 0 265 16
this 0 265 16
way: 0 265 16
“Fight 0 265 16
then 0 265 16
until 0 265 16
there 0 265 16
is 0 265 16
no 0 265 16
more 0 265 16
persecution, 0 265 16

God” 0 265 16
(2:193; 0 265 16
p. 0 265 16
133). 0 265 16

Whence 0 265 17
the 0 265 17
bracketed 0 265 17
interpolation 0 265 17
“at 0 265 17
the 0 265 17
shrine”? 0 265 17

Wills 1 265 18
doesn’t 1 265 18
give 1 265 18
any 1 265 18
source 1 265 18
for 1 265 18
it; 1 265 18
apparently 0 265 18
it 0 265 18
comes 0 265 18
from 0 265 18
none 0 265 18
other 0 265 18
than 0 265 18
Garry 0 265 18
Wills 0 265 18
himself. 0 265 18

By 0 265 19
adding 0 265 19
“at 0 265 19
the 0 265 19
shrine” 0 265 19
to 0 265 19
this 0 265 19
verse, 0 265 19
Wills 0 265 19
restricts 0 265 19
the 0 265 19
call 0 265 19
to 0 265 19
fight 0 265 19

fact 1 265 20
that 1 265 20

explains 0 265 21
the 0 265 21
passage 0 265 21
this 0 265 21
way: 0 265 21

The 0 265 22
worst 1 265 22
of 1 265 22
sins 1 265 22
are 0 265 22
Infidelity 0 265 22
( 0 265 22

Polytheism 0 265 22
( 0 265 22

are 1 265 23

The 0 265 26

Because 0 265 27
these 0 265 27

are 0 265 27
found 0 265 27
in 0 265 27

Throughout 0 265 28
his 0 265 28
book, 0 265 28
Wills’ 0 265 28
assurances 0 265 28
that 0 265 28
the 0 265 28
Qur’an 0 265 28
is 0 265 28
not 0 265 28
really 0 265 28
as 0 265 28
bad 0 265 28
as 0 265 28
“right-wing 1 265 28

or 0 265 28
that 0 265 28

contains 1 265 28
material 1 265 28
that 1 265 28
is 1 265 28

as 1 265 28

or 1 265 28
worse, 1 265 28
dissolve 0 265 28
under 0 265 28
close 0 265 28
scrutiny. 0 265 28

Again 1 265 29
and 1 265 29
again 1 265 29
it 1 265 29
turns 1 265 29
out 1 265 29
that 1 265 29
Wills 1 265 29
has 1 265 29
ignored 1 265 29
key 1 265 29
passages 1 265 29
in 1 265 29
order 1 265 29
to 1 265 29
make 1 265 29
his 1 265 29
case. 1 265 29

He 0 265 30
asks 0 265 30
why 0 265 30
the 0 265 30
Qur’an 0 265 30
is 0 265 30
“so 1 265 30
ferocious 1 265 30
to 0 265 30
‘hypocrites’ 1 265 30
and 0 265 30
apostates” 0 265 30
(p. 0 265 30
124). 0 265 30

Then 0 265 31
he 0 265 31
offers 0 265 31
a 0 265 31
quotation 0 265 31
from 0 265 31
the 0 265 31
New 0 265 31
Testament 0 265 31
Letter 0 265 31
to 0 265 31
the 0 265 31
Hebrews 0 265 31
saying 0 265 31
that 0 265 31
“if 0 265 31
we 0 265 31
sin 0 265 31
again 0 265 31
on 0 265 31
purpose” 0 265 31
there 0 265 31
is 0 265 31
“only 0 265 31
a 1 265 31
terrifying 1 265 31
judgment 1 265 31
to 0 265 31
come” 0 265 31
(p. 0 265 31
126). 0 265 31

Wills 0 265 32
concludes: 0 265 32
“The 0 265 32
Qur’an 0 265 32
is 0 265 32
not 0 265 32
as 0 265 32
absolute 0 265 32
as 0 265 32
this, 0 265 32
because 0 265 32
it 0 265 32
always 0 265 32
leaves 0 265 32
room 0 265 32
for 0 265 32
God’s 0 265 32
inexhaustible 1 265 32
mercy 1 265 32
and 1 265 32
forgiveness” 1 265 32
(p. 0 265 32
126). 0 265 32

That 1 265 33
sounds 1 265 33
wonderful, 1 265 33
and 0 265 33
certainly 0 265 33
pleasing 0 265 33
to 0 265 33
multicultural 0 265 33
ears 0 265 33
to 0 265 33
learn 0 265 33
that 0 265 33
the 0 265 33
Qur’an 0 265 33
is 0 265 33
more 0 265 33
merciful 0 265 33
than 0 265 33
the 0 265 33
New 0 265 33

Until 0 265 34

one 0 301 20
is, 0 301 20
if 0 301 20
you 0 301 20
look 0 301 20
at 0 301 20
President 0 301 20
Obama 0 301 20
versus 0 301 20
President 0 301 20
Trump, 0 301 20
there’s 0 301 20
no 0 301 20
question 0 301 20
that 0 301 20
President 0 301 20
Obama 0 301 20
was 0 301 20
more 0 301 20
cooperative 0 301 20
with 0 301 20
and 0 301 20
collaborative 0 301 20
with 0 301 20
Russia 0 301 20
and 0 301 20
the 0 301 20
Russian 0 301 20
agenda 0 301 20
than 0 301 20
President 0 301 20
Trump. 0 301 20

President 0 301 21
Trump 0 301 21
has 0 301 21
sent 0 301 21
lethal 1 301 21
arms 0 301 21
to 0 301 21
Ukraine—a 0 301 21
crucial 0 301 21
issue 0 301 21
for 0 301 21
Putin—which 0 301 21
President 0 301 21
Obama 0 301 21
refused 0 301 21
to 0 301 21
do. 0 301 21

President 0 301 22
Trump 0 301 22
has 0 301 22
bombed 0 301 22
the 0 301 22
Assad 0 301 22
forces 0 301 22
in 0 301 22
Syria, 0 301 22
a 0 301 22
client 0 301 22
state 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
Putin, 0 301 22
something 0 301 22
that 0 301 22
Obama 0 301 22
refused 0 301 22
to 0 301 22
do 0 301 22
because 0 301 22
he 0 301 22
didn’t 0 301 22
want 0 301 22
to 0 301 22
provoke 0 301 22
Putin. 0 301 22

Trump 0 301 23
has 0 301 23
expelled 0 301 23
more 1 301 23
Russian 0 301 23
diplomats 0 301 23
and 0 301 23
sanctioned 0 301 23
more 1 301 23
Russian 0 301 23
oligarchs 0 301 23
than 0 301 23
[Obama] 0 301 23
has. 0 301 23

Trump 0 301 24
undid 0 301 24
the 0 301 24
Iran 0 301 24
deal, 0 301 24
which 0 301 24
Russia 0 301 24
favored, 0 301 24
while 0 301 24
Obama 0 301 24
worked 0 301 24
with 0 301 24
Russia 0 301 24
in 0 301 24
order 0 301 24
to 0 301 24
do 0 301 24
the 0 301 24
Iran 0 301 24
deal. 0 301 24

So 0 301 25
this 0 301 25
idea 0 301 25
that 0 301 25
Trump 0 301 25
is 0 301 25
some 0 301 25
kind 0 301 25
of 0 301 25
a 0 301 25
puppet 1 301 25
of 0 301 25
Putin, 0 301 25
that 0 301 25
he 0 301 25
controls 0 301 25
him 0 301 25
with 0 301 25
blackmail, 0 301 25
is 0 301 25
the 0 301 25
kind 0 301 25
of 0 301 25
stuff 0 301 25
that 0 301 25
you 0 301 25
believe 0 301 25
if 0 301 25
you 0 301 25
read 0 301 25

many 0 301 25

Tom 0 301 26

out 0 301 26
by 0 301 26
the 0 301 26
facts. 0 301 26

The 0 301 27
other 0 301 27

that 0 301 27
I 0 301 27
want 0 301 27

make 0 301 27
is 0 301 27
that, 0 301 27
you 0 301 27
know, 0 301 27
again, 0 301 27
this 0 301 27
idea 0 301 27
that 0 301 27
somehow 0 301 27
that 0 301 27
you 0 301 27
are 0 301 27
endorsing 0 301 27
the 0 301 27
repression 0 301 27
of 0 301 27
other 0 301 27
countries’ 0 301 27
leaders 0 301 27
if 0 301 27
you 0 301 27
meet 0 301 27
with 0 301 27
them—it 0 301 27
is 0 301 27
true 0 301 27
that 0 301 27
Trump 0 301 27
has 0 301 27
never 0 301 27
criticized 0 301 27
Putin, 0 301 27
although 0 301 27
he 0 301 27
has 0 301 27
taken 0 301 27
all 0 301 27
the 0 301 27
steps 0 301 27
I 0 301 27
just 0 301 27
outlined 0 301 27
against 0 301 27
Putin. 0 301 27

But 0 301 28
he’s 0 301 28
also 0 301 28
never 1 301 28
criticized 0 301 28
Benjamin 0 301 28
Netanyahu. 0 301 28

He’s 0 301 29
also 0 301 29
never 1 301 29
criticized 0 301 29
the 0 301 29
incredibly 1 301 29
repressive 1 301 29
leaders 0 301 29
of 0 301 29
Saudi 0 301 29
Arabia. 0 301 29

He’s 0 301 30
never 1 301 30

the 0 301 30
fascist 1 301 30
president 0 301 30
of 0 301 30
the 0 301 30

It 0 301 31
is 0 301 31
true 0 301 31
President 0 301 31
Trump 0 301 31
likes 0 301 31
fascist 0 301 31
and 0 301 31
authoritarian 0 301 31

and 0 301 31
that 0 301 31
is 0 301 31
a 0 301 31
problem, 0 301 31
but 0 301 31
it’s 0 301 31
not 0 301 31
like 0 301 31
Putin 0 301 31

that 0 308 17
the 0 308 17
president 0 308 17
wasn’t 0 308 17
actually 0 308 17
issuing 0 308 17
an 0 308 17
order. 0 308 17

“I 0 308 18
talked 0 308 18
to 0 308 18
him 0 308 18
about 0 308 18
it 0 308 18
to 0 308 18
make 0 308 18
sure 0 308 18
he 0 308 18
was 0 308 18
on 0 308 18
the 0 308 18
same 0 308 18
page 0 308 18
as 0 308 18
we 0 308 18
are,” 0 308 18
Giuliani 0 308 18
said, 0 308 18
and 0 308 18
the 0 308 18
president 0 308 18
indicated 0 308 18
he 0 308 18
was 0 308 18
not 0 308 18
ordering 0 308 18
Sessions 0 308 18
to 0 308 18
act. 0 308 18

On 0 308 19
Sunday, 0 308 19
Giuliani 0 308 19
told 0 308 19
CBS’ 0 308 19
“Face 0 308 19
the 0 308 19
Nation”: 0 308 19
“Obstruction 0 308 19
by 0 308 19
tweet 0 308 19
is 0 308 19
not 0 308 19
something 0 308 19
I 0 308 19
think 0 308 19
works 0 308 19
real 0 308 19
well. 0 308 19

Generally 0 308 20
obstruction 0 308 20
is 0 308 20
secret, 0 308 20
it’s 0 308 20
clandestine, 0 308 20
it’s 0 308 20
corrupt.” 0 308 20

Giuliani 0 308 21
added, 0 308 21
“I’ve 1 308 21
looked 1 308 21
at 1 308 21
all 1 308 21
those 1 308 21
tweets 1 308 21
and 1 308 21
they 1 308 21
don’t 1 308 21
amount 1 308 21
to 1 308 21
anything.” 1 308 21

For 0 308 22
months, 0 308 22
Trump’s 0 308 22
lawyers 0 308 22
also 0 308 22
have 0 308 22
argued 0 308 22
that 0 308 22
it’s 0 308 22
impossible 0 308 22
for 0 308 22
the 0 308 22
president 0 308 22
to 0 308 22
obstruct 0 308 22
justice 0 308 22
because 0 308 22
his 0 308 22
constitutional 0 308 22
authority 0 308 22
extends 0 308 22
over 0 308 22
the 0 308 22
Justice 0 308 22
Department. 0 308 22

That 0 308 23
power 0 308 23
allows 0 308 23
him 0 308 23
to 0 308 23
direct 0 308 23
officials 0 308 23
where 0 308 23
to 0 308 23
focus 0 308 23
their 0 308 23
resources 0 308 23
or 0 308 23
to 0 308 23
fire 0 308 23
them 0 308 23
when 0 308 23
he 0 308 23
chooses, 0 308 23
as 0 308 23
Trump 0 308 23
did 0 308 23
when 0 308 23
removing 0 308 23
James 0 308 23
B. 0 308 23
Comey 0 308 23
as 0 308 23
FBI 0 308 23
director 0 308 23
last 0 308 23
year. 0 308 23

That 0 308 24
firing, 0 308 24
however, 0 308 24
led 0 308 24
to 0 308 24
Mueller’s 0 308 24
appointment 0 308 24
as 0 308 24
special 0 308 24
counsel. 0 308 24

Wednesday’s 0 308 25
tweet 0 308 25
was 0 308 25
a 0 308 25
reminder 0 308 25
of 0 308 25
Trump’s 0 308 25
unabated 1 308 25
anger 1 308 25
at 0 308 25
Sessions, 0 308 25
who 0 308 25
recused 0 308 25
himself 0 308 25
from 0 308 25
overseeing 0 308 25
the 0 308 25
Russia 0 308 25
investigation 0 308 25
on 0 308 25
March 0 308 25

both 0 308 25
parties 0 308 25
and 0 308 25
legal 0 308 25

have 0 308 25
contended 0 308 25
that 0 308 25
he 0 308 25
should. 0 308 25

Sessions 0 308 26
pointed 0 308 26
to 0 308 26
Justice 0 308 26
Department 0 308 26
regulations 0 308 26
to 0 308 26
explain 0 308 26
that, 0 308 26
as 0 308 26
one 1 308 26
of 1 308 26
Trump’s 1 308 26
earliest 1 308 26
and 1 308 26
most 1 308 26
active 1 308 26
supporters, 1 308 26
he 0 308 26
shouldn’t 0 308 26
participate 0 308 26
in 0 308 26
the 0 308 26
investigation 0 308 26
of 0 308 26
the 0 308 26
Trump 0 308 26
campaign. 0 308 26

He 0 308 27
announced 0 308 27
the 0 308 27
decision 0 308 27
after 0 308 27
controversy 0 308 27
over 0 308 27
his 0 308 27
own 0 308 27
undisclosed 0 308 27
contacts, 0 308 27
both 0 308 27
during 0 308 27
the 0 308 27
campaign 0 308 27
and 0 308 27
the 0 308 27
post-election 0 308 27
transition, 0 308 27
with 0 308 27
the 0 308 27
Russian 0 308 27
ambassador 0 308 27
at 0 308 27
the 0 308 27
time, 0 308 27
Sergey 0 308 27
Kislyak. 0 308 27

Two 1 308 28
months 1 308 28
ago, 1 308 28
Trump 1 308 28
tweeted 1 308 28
that 1 308 28
he 1 308 28
should 1 308 28
have 1 308 28
chosen 1 308 28
a 1 308 28
different 1 308 28
person 1 308 28
as 1 308 28
attorney 1 308 28
general 1 308 28
who 1 308 28
wouldn’t 1 308 28
have 1 308 28
needed 1 308 28
to 1 308 28
recuse 1 308 28
himself. 1 308 28

“I 1 308 29
wish 1 308 29
I 1 308 29
did!” 1 308 29
he 1 308 29
wrote. 1 308 29

In 1 308 30
his 1 308 30
tweets, 1 308 30
Trump 1 308 30
also 1 308 30
quoted 1 308 30
criticism 1 308 30
of 1 308 30
the 1 308 30
investigation 1 308 30
from 1 308 30
Alan 1 308 30
Dershowitz, 1 308 30
a 1 308 30
Harvard 1 308 30
Law 1 308 30
School 1 308 30
professor 1 308 30
who 1 308 30
frequently 1 308 30
defends 1 308 30
Trump 1 308 30
on 1 308 30
television. 1 308 30

In 1 308 31
an 1 308 31
interview 1 308 31
with 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
Los 1 308 31
Angeles 1 308 31
Times, 1 308 31
Dershowitz 1 308 31
said 1 308 31
he 1 308 31
does 1 308 31
not 1 308 31
believe 1 308 31
Sessions 1 308 31
has 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
authority 1 308 31
to 1 308 31
end 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
probe. 1 308 31

“You 1 308 32
can’t 1 308 32
be 1 308 32
both 1 308 32
recused 1 308 32
and 1 308 32
making 1 308 32
decisions 1 308 32
about 1 308 32
the 1 308 32
investigation,” 1 308 32
he 1 308 32
said. 1 308 32

But 0 308 33
Dershowitz 0 308 33
also 0 308 33
cast 0 308 33
doubt 0 308 33
on 0 308 33
whether 0 308 33
Trump’s 0 308 33
tweets 0 308 33
can 0 308 33
be 0 308 33
seen 0 308 33
as 0 308 33
an 0 308 33
act 0 308 33
of 0 308 33
obstruction. 0 308 33

“You 0 308 34
cannot 0 308 34
obstruct 0 308 34
justice 0 308 34
by 0 308 34
openly 0 308 34
exercising 0 308 34
your 0 308 34
First 0 308 34
Amendment 0 308 34
rights 0 308 34
and 0 308 34
openly 0 308 34
criticizing 0 308 34
a 0 308 34
prosecution, 0 308 34
whether 0 308 34
you’re 0 308 34
right 0 308 34
or 0 308 34
wrong,” 0 308 34
he 0 308 34
said. 0 308 34

“Obstruction 0 308 35
of 0 308 35
justice 0 308 35
is 0 308 35
generally 0 308 35
committed 0 308 35
behind 0 308 35
the 0 308 35
scenes, 0 308 35
so 0 308 35
I 0 308 35
think 0 308 35
both 0 308 35
sides 0 308 35
are 0 308 35
a 0 308 35
little 0 308 35
overwrought 0 308 35
here.” 0 308 35

Stephen 0 308 36
Vladeck, 0 308 36
a 0 308 36
University 0 308 36
of 0 308 36
Texas 0 308 36
law 0 308 36
professor, 0 308 36
agreed 0 308 36
that 0 308 36
Sessions 0 308 36
cannot 0 308 36
stop 0 308 36
the 0 308 36
Russia 0 308 36
investigation 0 308 36
given 0 308 36
that 0 308 36
he 0 308 36
recused 0 308 36
himself. 0 308 36

“The 0 308 37
president, 0 308 37
intentionally 0 308 37
or 0 308 37
not, 0 308 37
is 0 308 37
misdirecting 1 308 37
his 1 308 37
ire,” 1 308 37
Vladeck 0 308 37
said. 0 308 37

If 0 308 38
Trump 0 308 38
wanted 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
use 0 308 38
his 0 308 38
power 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
end 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
probe, 0 308 38
he 0 308 38
would 0 308 38
have 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
give 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
order 0 308 38

comply, 0 308 38
according 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
Vladeck. 0 308 38

echoed 0 78 18
this 0 78 18
claim. 0 78 18

The 0 78 19
outcome 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
these 0 78 19
two 0 78 19
incidents 0 78 19
was 0 78 19
the 0 78 19
passage 0 78 19
by 0 78 19
Congress 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
the 0 78 19
Gulf 0 78 19
of 0 78 19

Resolution, 0 78 19
which 0 78 19
granted 0 78 19
then-President 0 78 19

B. 0 78 19
Johnson 0 78 19
the 0 78 19

Asian 0 78 19
country 0 78 19
whose 0 78 19
government 0 78 19
was 0 78 19
considered 0 78 19
to 0 78 19
be 0 78 19
jeopardized 0 78 19
by 0 78 19
“communist 0 78 19
aggression.” 0 78 19
The 0 78 19
resolution 0 78 19
served 0 78 19
as 0 78 19
Johnson’s 0 78 19
legal 0 78 19
justification 0 78 19
for 0 78 19
deploying 0 78 19

the 0 78 19
commencement 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
open 0 78 19
warfare 0 78 19
against 0 78 19
North 0 78 19
Vietnam. 0 78 19

As 0 78 20
a 0 78 20
result, 0 78 20
58,177 0 78 20
Americans 1 78 20
would 0 78 20
lose 0 78 20
their 0 78 20
lives. 0 78 20

Additionally, 0 78 21
over 0 78 21
one 0 78 21
million 0 78 21
North 0 78 21
and 0 78 21
South 0 78 21
Vietnamese, 0 78 21
including 0 78 21
627,000 0 78 21
civilians 0 78 21
would 0 78 21
be 0 78 21
slaughtered. 1 78 21

But 0 78 22
it 0 78 22
wasn’t 0 78 22
true. 0 78 22

At 1 78 23
all. 1 78 23

In 0 78 24

the 0 78 24

incident, 0 78 24
as 0 78 24
it 0 78 24
became 0 78 24
known, 0 78 24
turned 0 78 24
out 0 78 24
to 0 78 24
be 0 78 24
a 0 78 24

to 0 78 24
the 0 78 24
deaths 0 78 24
of 0 78 24
tens 1 78 24
of 1 78 24
thousands 1 78 24
of 0 78 24
U.S. 0 78 24
troops 0 78 24
and 0 78 24
millions 0 78 24
of 0 78 24

anti-war 0 78 24
movement 0 78 24
in 0 78 24
American 0 78 24
history, 0 78 24
and 0 78 24
tarnishing 0 78 24
the 0 78 24
reputation 0 78 24
of 0 78 24
a 0 78 24
nation 0 78 24

least 0 78 24
somewhat 0 78 24
noble 0 78 24
in 0 78 24
the 0 78 24
eyes 0 78 24
of 0 78 24
the 0 78 24
world. 0 78 24

The 0 78 25
truth 0 78 25
of 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
matter 0 78 25
was 0 78 25
that 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
Maddox 0 78 25
was 0 78 25
engaged 0 78 25
in 0 78 25
an 0 78 25
aggressive 1 78 25
intelligence 0 78 25

coordinated 0 78 25
attacks 0 78 25

by 0 78 25
the 0 78 25

and 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
Laotian 0 78 25
air 0 78 25
force. 0 78 25

When 0 78 26
the 0 78 26
government 0 78 26
announced 0 78 26
that 0 78 26
it 0 78 26
had 0 78 26
been 0 78 26
the 0 78 26
victim 0 78 26
of 0 78 26
an 0 78 26
unprovoked 0 78 26
attack—this 0 78 26
was 0 78 26
a 0 78 26
lie. 0 78 26

In 0 78 27
the 0 78 27
2003 0 78 27

Robert 0 78 27
S. 0 78 27

that 0 78 27
the 0 78 27

of 0 78 27

attack 0 78 27
never 0 78 27
happened. 0 78 27

In 0 78 28
1995, 0 78 28
McNamara 0 78 28
met 0 78 28
with 0 78 28
former 0 78 28

Army 0 78 28
General 0 78 28

what 0 78 28
happened 0 78 28
on 0 78 28
August 0 78 28
4, 0 78 28
1964 0 78 28
in 0 78 28
the 0 78 28
second 0 78 28
Gulf 0 78 28
of 0 78 28
Tonkin 0 78 28
Incident. 0 78 28

“Absolutely 0 78 29
nothing”, 0 78 29
Giáp 0 78 29
replied. 0 78 29

Giáp 0 78 30
claimed 0 78 30
that 0 78 30
the 0 78 30
attack 0 78 30
had 0 78 30
been 0 78 30
imaginary. 0 78 30

In 0 78 31
2010, 0 78 31
more 0 78 31
than 0 78 31
1,100 0 78 31
transcripts 0 78 31
from 0 78 31
the 0 78 31
Vietnam 0 78 31
era 0 78 31
were 0 78 31
released, 0 78 31
proving 0 78 31
Congress 0 78 31
and 0 78 31
officials 0 78 31
raised 0 78 31
serious 0 78 31
doubts 0 78 31
about 0 78 31
the 0 78 31
information 0 78 31

But 0 78 32
while 0 78 32
this 0 78 32
internal 0 78 32
grumbling 0 78 32
took 0 78 32
place, 0 78 32
mainstream 0 78 32
media 0 78 32
dutifully 0 78 32
reported 0 78 32
official 0 78 32
statements 0 78 32
as 0 78 32
if 0 78 32
the 0 78 32
veracity 0 78 32
of 0 78 32
the 0 78 32

couldn’t 0 78 32

explained 0 78 33
the 0 78 33

egregiously 0 78 33
erred 0 78 33
in 0 78 33
“almost 0 78 33
exclusive 0 78 33
reliance 0 78 33
on 0 78 33

If 0 78 34
due 0 78 34

had 0 78 34
been 0 78 34
performed, 0 78 34
and 0 78 34
reporters 0 78 34
had 0 78 34
raised 0 78 34
appropriate 0 78 34
doubts 0 78 34
about 0 78 34
the 0 78 34
Gulf 0 78 34
of 0 78 34
Tonkin 0 78 34
false 0 78 34
flag, 0 78 34
it’s 0 78 34
arguable 0 78 34
whether 0 78 34
support 0 78 34
for 0 78 34
the 0 78 34
contentious 0 78 34

Now, 0 78 35
retired 0 78 35
military 0 78 35
officials—who 0 78 35
pay 0 78 35
attention 0 78 35

“I 0 78 36
think 0 78 36
the 0 78 36

to 0 78 36

carefully 0 78 36
for 0 78 36
the 0 78 36

months 0 314 1

That 0 314 3
delay 0 314 3
is 0 314 3
facing 0 314 3

in 0 314 3

But 0 314 17
there 0 314 17

"In 0 314 19
hindsight 0 314 19
I 0 314 19
wish 0 314 19
there 0 314 19

"When 1 314 41
we 1 314 41

Abdul-Ghani's 0 314 44
mother, 0 314 44
Hakima 0 314 44
Ramzi, 0 314 44
could 0 314 44

But 0 314 45
hours 0 314 45
earlier, 0 314 45
Ramzi 0 314 45
told 0 314 45
CNN 0 314 45
she 0 314 45
had 0 314 45
no 0 314 45

nine 0 314 45

"My 0 314 46
husband 0 314 46

he 0 314 46
was 0 314 46
taking 0 314 46
Abdul-Ghani 0 314 46
to 0 314 46
the 0 314 46
park, 0 314 46
and 0 314 46
didn't 0 314 46
come 0 314 46

That 0 314 47
was 0 314 47
in 0 314 47
November 0 314 47
2017. 0 314 47

When 0 314 48
I 0 314 48
would 0 314 48
ask 0 314 48
him 0 314 48
where 0 314 48
he 0 314 48
was, 0 314 48
he 0 314 48

he 0 314 48
was 0 314 48
on 0 314 48
his 0 314 48
way, 0 314 48
he 0 314 48
was 0 314 48

he 0 314 48
was 0 314 48
just 0 314 48
keeping 0 314 48
him 0 314 48
for 0 314 48
the 0 314 48
night. 0 314 48

But 0 314 49
I 0 314 49
haven't 0 314 49
seen 0 314 49
him 0 314 49
since 0 314 49
then," 0 314 49
Ramzi 0 314 49
said 0 314 49
Tuesday. 0 314 49

She 0 314 50
said 0 314 50

walk 0 314 50
and 0 314 50
suffers 0 314 50
seizures, 0 314 50
and 0 314 50
requires 0 314 50
constant 0 314 50
medical 0 314 50
attention. 0 314 50

An 0 314 51
arrest 0 314 51

states 0 314 51
that 0 314 51

an 1 314 51
exorcism" 1 314 51
on 0 314 51
the 0 314 51
child 0 314 51
because 0 314 51
he 0 314 51
believed 0 314 51

was 1 314 51
possessed 1 314 51
by 1 314 51
the 1 314 51
devil. 1 314 51

But 0 314 52
Ramzi 0 314 52
said 0 314 52

"It's 0 314 53
not 0 314 53

child 0 321 36
abuse 0 321 36
each 0 321 36
after 0 321 36
police 0 321 36
raided 0 321 36
their 0 321 36
compound 0 321 36
in 0 321 36
New 0 321 36
Mexico 0 321 36

discovered 0 321 36
11 1 321 36
malnourished 1 321 36
children 1 321 36
living 1 321 36
in 1 321 36
squalor. 1 321 36

Their 0 321 37
lawyer 0 321 37
argued 0 321 37
that 0 321 37
there 0 321 37
was 0 321 37
a 0 321 37
double 0 321 37
standard 0 321 37
in 0 321 37
the 0 321 37
case 0 321 37
because 0 321 37
his 0 321 37
clients 0 321 37
were 0 321 37
Muslims. 0 321 37

He 1 321 38
argued 1 321 38
that 1 321 38
if 1 321 38
they 1 321 38
had 1 321 38
been 1 321 38
Christian 1 321 38
and 1 321 38
white, 1 321 38
“we 1 321 38
might 1 321 38
not 1 321 38
be 1 321 38
here 1 321 38
today.” 1 321 38
Despite 0 321 38
law 0 321 38
enforcement 0 321 38
authorities 0 321 38
saying 0 321 38
that 0 321 38
they 0 321 38
believe 0 321 38
that 0 321 38
the 0 321 38
children 0 321 38
were 0 321 38
being 0 321 38
trained 0 321 38
to 0 321 38
attack 0 321 38
innocents, 0 321 38
and 0 321 38
that 0 321 38
the 0 321 38
adults 0 321 38
were 0 321 38
radicalized, 0 321 38
Judge 0 321 38
Sarah 0 321 38
Backus 0 321 38
released 0 321 38
the 0 321 38
suspects. 0 321 38

Prosecutors 0 321 39
also 0 321 39
said 0 321 39
they 0 321 39
obtained 0 321 39
a 0 321 39
letter 0 321 39
from 0 321 39
one 0 321 39
of 0 321 39
the 0 321 39
suspects 0 321 39
telling 0 321 39
his 0 321 39
brother 0 321 39
to 0 321 39
come 0 321 39
to 0 321 39
the 0 321 39
compound 0 321 39
and 0 321 39
die 1 321 39
like 1 321 39
a 1 321 39
martyr. 1 321 39

The 0 321 40
lawyer 0 321 40
for 0 321 40
the 0 321 40
suspects 0 321 40
said 0 321 40
that 0 321 40
there 0 321 40
was 0 321 40
no 0 321 40
evidence 0 321 40
that 0 321 40

an 1 322 6
information 1 322 6
war, 1 322 6
with 0 322 6
prosecutors 0 322 6
and 0 322 6
many 0 322 6
victims 0 322 6
saying 0 322 6
it’s 0 322 6
the 0 322 6

of 0 322 6
holding 0 322 6

the 0 322 6

depicts 0 322 6
an 0 322 6
era 0 322 6
of 0 322 6
another 0 322 6

The 0 322 7
report 0 322 7
has 0 322 7
helped 0 322 7
renew 0 322 7
a 0 322 7
crisis 0 322 7
many 0 322 7
in 0 322 7
the 0 322 7
church 0 322 7
thought 0 322 7
and 0 322 7
hoped 0 322 7
had 0 322 7
ended 0 322 7
nearly 0 322 7
20 0 322 7
years 0 322 7
ago 0 322 7
after 1 322 7
the 1 322 7
scandal 1 322 7
erupted 1 322 7
in 0 322 7
Boston. 0 322 7

But 1 322 8
recent 1 322 8
abuse-related 1 322 8
scandals, 1 322 8
from 1 322 8
Chile 1 322 8
to 1 322 8
Australia, 1 322 8
have 1 322 8
reopened 1 322 8
wounding 1 322 8
questions 1 322 8
about 1 322 8
accountability 1 322 8
and 1 322 8
whether 1 322 8
church 1 322 8
officials 1 322 8
are 1 322 8
still 1 322 8
covering 1 322 8
up 1 322 8
crimes 1 322 8
at 1 322 8
the 1 322 8
highest 1 322 8
levels. 1 322 8

The 1 322 9
new 1 322 9
wave 1 322 9
of 1 322 9
allegations 1 322 9
has 1 322 9
called 1 322 9
Pope 1 322 9
Francis’s 1 322 9
handling 1 322 9
of 1 322 9
abuse 1 322 9
into 1 322 9
question 1 322 9
as 1 322 9
many 1 322 9
Catholics 1 322 9
look 1 322 9
to 1 322 9
him 1 322 9
to 1 322 9
help 1 322 9
the 1 322 9
church 1 322 9
regain 1 322 9
its 1 322 9
credibility. 1 322 9

The 1 322 10
pope’s 1 322 10
track 1 322 10
record 1 322 10
has 1 322 10
been 1 322 10
mixed, 1 322 10
something 1 322 10
some 1 322 10
outsiders 1 322 10
attribute 1 322 10
to 1 322 10
his 1 322 10
learning 1 322 10
curve 1 322 10
or 1 322 10
shortcomings 1 322 10
and 0 322 10
others 0 322 10
chalk 0 322 10
up 0 322 10
to 0 322 10
resistance 0 322 10
from 0 322 10
a 1 322 10
notoriously 1 322 10
change-averse 1 322 10
institution. 1 322 10

The 0 322 11
Pennsylvania 0 322 11
grand 0 322 11
jury 0 322 11
report 0 322 11
follows 0 322 11
the 0 322 11
resignation 0 322 11
last 0 322 11
month 0 322 11
of 0 322 11
Cardinal 0 322 11
Theodore 0 322 11
McCarrick, 0 322 11
a 1 322 11
towering 1 322 11
figure 1 322 11
in 1 322 11
the 1 322 11
U.S. 1 322 11
church 1 322 11
and 0 322 11
former 0 322 11
D.C. 0 322 11
archbishop 0 322 11
who 0 322 11
was 0 322 11
accused 0 322 11
of 0 322 11
sexually 0 322 11
abusing 0 322 11
minors 0 322 11
and 0 322 11
adults 0 322 11
for 0 322 11
decades. 0 322 11

Both 0 322 12
have 0 322 12
further 0 322 12
polarized 0 322 12
the 0 322 12
church 0 322 12
on 0 322 12
homosexuality, 0 322 12
celibacy 0 322 12
and 0 322 12
whether 0 322 12
laypeople 0 322 12
should 0 322 12
have 0 322 12
more 0 322 12

power. 0 322 13
It 0 322 13
has 0 322 13
also 0 322 13
triggered 0 322 13
debate 0 322 13
about 0 322 13
whether 0 322 13
statutes 0 322 13
of 0 322 13
limitations 0 322 13
should 0 322 13
be 0 322 13
expanded. 0 322 13

“We’re 0 322 14
dealing 0 322 14
with 0 322 14
a 0 322 14
long-term 0 322 14
struggle 0 322 14
not 0 322 14
only 0 322 14
about 0 322 14
the 0 322 14
meaning 0 322 14
of 0 322 14
justice, 0 322 14
but 0 322 14
about 0 322 14
the 0 322 14
meaning 0 322 14
of 0 322 14
memory,” 0 322 14
said 0 322 14
Jason 0 322 14
Berry, 0 322 14
a 0 322 14
reporter 0 322 14
and 0 322 14
author 0 322 14
who 0 322 14
has 0 322 14
covered 0 322 14
the 0 322 14
sexual 0 322 14
abuse 0 322 14
crisis 0 322 14
for 0 322 14
decades. 0 322 14

“And 1 322 15
how 1 322 15
honest 1 322 15
the 1 322 15
church 1 322 15
has 1 322 15
been 1 322 15
about 1 322 15
this 1 322 15

crisis. 1 322 16
Most 1 322 16
bishops, 1 322 16
besides 1 322 16
apologies, 1 322 16
have 1 322 16
not 1 322 16
been 1 322 16
on 1 322 16
the 1 322 16
cutting 1 322 16
edge 1 322 16
of 1 322 16
change.” 1 322 16

Church 0 322 17
officials 0 322 17
began 0 322 17
bracing 0 322 17
for 0 322 17
the 0 322 17
aftermath 0 322 17
of 0 322 17
the 0 322 17

report. 0 322 18
On 0 322 18

his 0 322 18
priests 0 322 18
in 0 322 18
a 0 322 18

“profoundly 1 322 18

REMNANT 0 322 19
COMMENT: 0 322 19
The 0 322 19
report 0 322 19

that 0 322 19
“more 0 322 19

Wuerl’s 0 322 19
former 0 322 19

which 0 322 19
is 0 322 19
ironic 0 322 19
since 0 322 19
Wuerl 0 322 19
is 0 322 19
one 0 322 19
of 0 322 19

Cardinal 1 322 20

Wuerl! 1 322 21
So, 0 322 21
let 0 322 21
me 0 322 21
get 0 322 21
this 0 322 21
straight 0 322 21
(I 0 322 21
know, 1 322 21
lots 1 322 21

Donald 0 327 10
Trump 0 327 10
is 1 327 10
totally 1 327 10
correct 1 327 10
that 0 327 10
nuclear 0 327 10
war 0 327 10
would 0 327 10
be 0 327 10
a 0 327 10
terminable 0 327 10
event 0 327 10
and 0 327 10
that 0 327 10
nothing 1 327 10
is 1 327 10
more 1 327 10
important 1 327 10
than 0 327 10
restoring 0 327 10
a 0 327 10
cooperative 0 327 10

between 0 327 10
the 0 327 10
US 0 327 10

Russia. 0 327 10

The 0 327 11
problem 0 327 11
is 0 327 11
that 0 327 11
the 0 327 11
military/security 0 327 11
complex 0 327 11
sees 0 327 11
it 0 327 11
differently. 0 327 11

After 0 327 12
70 0 327 12
years 0 327 12
of 0 327 12
entrenchment 0 327 12
the 0 327 12
military/security 0 327 12
complex 0 327 12
is 0 327 12
an 0 327 12
independent 0 327 12
political 0 327 12
force. 0 327 12

President 0 327 13

the 0 327 13
American 0 327 13
people 0 327 13
about 0 327 13

to 0 327 13
no 0 327 13

From 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
standpoint 0 327 14
of 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
military/security 0 327 14
complex, 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
problem 0 327 14
of 0 327 14
normalizing 0 327 14
relations 0 327 14
with 0 327 14
Russia 0 327 14
is 0 327 14
that 0 327 14
it 0 327 14
downgrades 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
“Russian 0 327 14
threat” 0 327 14
that 0 327 14
is 0 327 14
so 0 327 14
essential 0 327 14
to 0 327 14
the 0 327 14

that 0 327 14
such 0 327 14
a 0 327 14
massive 1 327 14

conveys. 0 327 14

Only 0 327 15
16 0 327 15

a 0 327 19
case 0 327 19
against 0 327 19
President 0 327 19

After 0 327 20
two 0 327 20
years 0 327 20
the 0 327 20
only 0 327 20
evidence 0 327 20
we 0 327 20
have 0 327 20
of 0 327 20
Russiagate 0 327 20
is 0 327 20
that 0 327 20
it 1 327 20
is 1 327 20
a 1 327 20
conspiracy 1 327 20
against 1 327 20
President 1 327 20
Trump 1 327 20
and 1 327 20
the 1 327 20
American 1 327 20
people. 1 327 20

Indeed, 0 327 21
Mueller, 0 327 21
fully 0 327 21
aware 0 327 21
that 0 327 21
there 0 327 21
was 0 327 21
no 0 327 21
Trump-Putin 0 327 21
conspiracy, 0 327 21
has 0 327 21
not 0 327 21
bothered 0 327 21
to 0 327 21
look 0 327 21
for 0 327 21
any 0 327 21
evidence 0 327 21
as 0 327 21
there 0 327 21
can 0 327 21
be 0 327 21
no 0 327 21
evidence 0 327 21
of 0 327 21
something 0 327 21
that 0 327 21
did 0 327 21
not 0 327 21
happen. 0 327 21

He 0 327 22
pulled 0 327 22
out 0 327 22
of 0 327 22
a 0 327 22
hat 0 327 22
some 0 327 22
phony 0 327 22
and 0 327 22
meaningless 0 327 22
indictments 0 327 22
of 0 327 22

to 0 327 22
make 0 327 22
it 0 327 22
look 0 327 22
like 0 327 22
there 0 327 22
was 0 327 22
a 0 327 22
conspiracy 0 327 22
without 0 327 22
having 0 327 22
to 0 327 22
prove 0 327 22
it, 0 327 22
but 0 327 22
his 0 327 22
main 0 327 22

has 0 327 22
been 0 327 22
on 0 327 22
framing 0 327 22
Paul 0 327 22
Manafort. 0 327 22

Mueller’s 0 327 23
investigation 0 327 23
of 0 327 23
Manafort 0 327 23
has 0 327 23
nothing 0 327 23
to 0 327 23
do 0 327 23
with 0 327 23
the 0 327 23
Russiagate 0 327 23
story 0 327 23
line. 0 327 23

Manafort’s 0 327 24
alleged 0 327 24
crimes 0 327 24
are 0 327 24
far 0 327 24
outside 0 327 24
Mueller’s 0 327 24
mandate 0 327 24
and 0 327 24
took 0 327 24
place, 0 327 24
if 0 327 24
they 0 327 24
did, 0 327 24
years 0 327 24
before 0 327 24
the 0 327 24
alleged 0 327 24
events 0 327 24
of 0 327 24
Russiagate. 0 327 24

Manafort’s 0 327 25
conviction 0 327 25
by 0 327 25
a 0 327 25
jury 0 327 25
on 0 327 25
8 0 327 25
of 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
18 0 327 25
counts 0 327 25
is 0 327 25
being 0 327 25
misrepresented 0 327 25
by 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
Trump-hating 0 327 25
presstitutes 0 327 25
as 0 327 25
vindication 0 327 25
of 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
Russiagate 0 327 25
investigation 0 327 25
and 0 327 25
as 0 327 25
“A 0 327 25
dark 0 327 25
day 0 327 25
for 0 327 25
Trump,” 0 327 25
with 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
presstitutes 0 327 25
suggesting 0 327 25
a 0 327 25
Watergate 0 327 25
parallel 0 327 25
that 0 327 25
will 0 327 25
force 0 327 25
Trump 0 327 25
from 0 327 25
office. 0 327 25

Manafort 0 327 26
was 0 327 26
found 0 327 26
guilty 0 327 26
not 0 327 26
of 0 327 26
Russiagate, 0 327 26
but 0 327 26
of 0 327 26
income 0 327 26
tax 0 327 26
evasion 0 327 26
and 0 327 26
misrepresenting 0 327 26
his 0 327 26
financial 0 327 26
position 0 327 26
on 0 327 26
a 0 327 26
loan 0 327 26
application. 0 327 26

We 0 327 27
do 0 327 27
not 0 327 27
know 0 327 27
if 0 327 27
Manafort 0 327 27
is 0 327 27
guilty 0 327 27
or 0 327 27
is 0 327 27
simply 0 327 27
a 0 327 27
victim 0 327 27
of 0 327 27
Mueller’s 0 327 27
frameup 0 327 27
and 0 327 27
an 1 327 27
incompetent 1 327 27
jury. 1 327 27

American 0 327 28
juries 0 327 28
are 0 327 28
notoriously 0 327 28
incompetent, 0 327 28
which 0 327 28
is 0 327 28
why 0 327 28
97% 0 327 28
of 0 327 28
felony 0 327 28
indictments 0 327 28
are 0 327 28
settled 0 327 28
with 0 327 28
a 0 327 28
plea 0 327 28
bargain. 0 327 28

Even 0 327 29
the 0 327 29
innocent 0 327 29
had 0 327 29
rather 0 327 29
work 0 327 29
out 0 327 29
a 0 327 29
plea 0 327 29
arrangement 0 327 29
and 0 327 29
admit 0 327 29
to 0 327 29
something 0 327 29
that 0 327 29
they 0 327 29
did 0 327 29
not 0 327 29
do 0 327 29
than 0 327 29
to 0 327 29
face 0 327 29
an 1 327 29
insouciant 1 327 29
American 1 327 29
jury. 1 327 29

Remember 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
jury 0 327 30
that 0 327 30
condemned 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
survivors 0 327 30
of 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
FBI’s 0 327 30
massacre 0 327 30
of 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
Branch 0 327 30
Davidians 0 327 30
in 0 327 30
Waco, 0 327 30
Texas, 0 327 30
to 0 327 30
be 0 327 30
locked 0 327 30
away 0 327 30
for 0 327 30
many 0 327 30
years 0 327 30
so 0 327 30
that 0 327 30
they 0 327 30
could 0 327 30
not 0 327 30
talk 0 327 30
and 0 327 30
tell 0 327 30
of 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
mass 0 327 30
murder 0 327 30
inflicted 0 327 30
on 0 327 30
a 0 327 30
religious 0 327 30
group 0 327 30
by 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
FBI. 0 327 30

It 0 327 31
is 0 327 31
unclear 0 327 31
how 0 327 31
much 0 327 31
of 0 327 31
a 0 327 31
crime 0 327 31
it 0 327 31
can 0 327 31
be 0 327 31
to 0 327 31
misrepresent 0 327 31
your 0 327 31
financial 0 327 31
position 0 327 31
on 0 327 31
a 0 327 31
loan 0 327 31
application 0 327 31
when 0 327 31
one 0 327 31
of 0 327 31
the 0 327 31
causes 0 327 31
of 0 327 31
the 0 327 31
mortgage-backed 0 327 31
derivative 0 327 31
crisis 0 327 31
was 0 327 31
the 0 327 31
misrepresentation 0 327 31
of 0 327 31
mortgage 0 327 31
applicants 0 327 31
on 0 327 31

the 0 327 31

issuing 0 327 31
the 0 327 31

Instead 0 327 32
of 0 327 32
prosecution, 0 327 32
Washington 0 327 32
relied 0 327 32
on 0 327 32
the 0 327 32

This 0 327 43
tactic 0 327 43
is 0 327 43
used 0 327 43
every 0 327 43
day 0 327 43

and 0 327 47
for 0 327 47
making 0 327 47
false 0 327 47
statements 0 327 47
not 0 327 47
under 0 327 47
oath 0 327 47
to 0 327 47
the 0 327 47
US 0 327 47
government. 0 327 47

Reportedly, 0 327 48
Manafort 0 327 48
is 0 327 48
being 0 327 48
held 0 327 48
in 0 327 48
solitary 0 327 48
confinement, 0 327 48
a 0 327 48
form 0 327 48
of 0 327 48
torture 0 327 48
designed 0 327 48
to 0 327 48
break 0 327 48
a 0 327 48
person’s 0 327 48
spirit. 0 327 48

Like 0 327 49
Manafort’s 0 327 49
first 0 327 49
trial, 0 327 49
his 0 327 49
second 0 327 49
trial 0 327 49
has 0 327 49
nothing 0 327 49
whatsoever 0 327 49
to 0 327 49
do 0 327 49
with 0 327 49
Russiagate, 0 327 49
but 0 327 49
you 0 327 49
will 0 327 49
never 0 327 49
learn 0 327 49
that 0 327 49
from 0 327 49
the 0 327 49
presstitute 0 327 49
media 0 327 49
or 0 327 49
from 0 327 49
the 0 327 49
Democratic 0 327 49
Party. 0 327 49

Manafort 0 327 50
can 0 327 50
still 0 327 50
be 0 327 50
coerced 0 327 50
to 0 327 50
say 0 327 50
something 0 327 50
that 0 327 50
can 0 327 50
be 0 327 50
used 0 327 50
to 0 327 50
drive 0 327 50
Trump 0 327 50
from 0 327 50
office. 0 327 50

What 0 327 51
about 0 327 51
Michael 0 327 51
Cohen, 0 327 51
a 0 327 51
former 0 327 51
attorney 0 327 51
for 0 327 51
Trump? 0 327 51

Mueller 0 327 52
saw 0 327 52
no 0 327 52
value 0 327 52
in 0 327 52
the 0 327 52
Cohen 0 327 52
case 0 327 52
and 0 327 52
passed 0 327 52
it 0 327 52
off 0 327 52
to 0 327 52
a 0 327 52
regular 0 327 52
US 0 327 52
attorney 0 327 52
to 0 327 52
prosecute. 0 327 52

Therefore, 0 327 53
it 0 327 53
would 0 327 53
appear 0 327 53
not 0 327 53
to 0 327 53
be 0 327 53
part 0 327 53
of 0 327 53
the 0 327 53
Russiagate 0 327 53
investigation. 0 327 53

Cohen 0 327 54
avoided 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
jury 0 327 54
and 0 327 54
said 0 327 54
he 0 327 54
was 0 327 54
guilty 0 327 54
of 0 327 54
five 0 327 54
counts 0 327 54
of 0 327 54
personal 0 327 54
income 0 327 54
tax 0 327 54
evasion, 0 327 54
one 0 327 54
count 0 327 54
of 0 327 54
making 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
false 0 327 54
statement 0 327 54
to 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
financial 0 327 54
institution 0 327 54
in 0 327 54
order 0 327 54
to 0 327 54
get 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
loan, 0 327 54
and 0 327 54
two 0 327 54
counts 0 327 54
related 0 327 54
to 0 327 54
illegal 0 327 54
campaign 0 327 54
contributions. 0 327 54

With 0 327 55
regard 0 327 55
to 0 327 55
the 0 327 55
campagin 0 327 55
contributions, 0 327 55
he 0 327 55
contradicted 0 327 55
his 0 327 55
previous 0 327 55
statements. 0 327 55

He 0 327 56
said 0 327 56
that 0 327 56
on 0 327 56
Trump’s 0 327 56
instruction, 0 327 56
he 0 327 56
paid 0 327 56
off 0 327 56
two 0 327 56
women 0 327 56
who 0 327 56
were 0 327 56
claiming 0 327 56
sexual 0 327 56
affairs 0 327 56
with 0 327 56
Trump. 0 327 56

The 1 327 57
intricacies 1 327 57
of 1 327 57
American 1 327 57
laws 1 327 57
relating 1 327 57
to 1 327 57
politics 1 327 57
are 1 327 57
often 1 327 57
unclear. 1 327 57

Apparently, 0 327 58
the 0 327 58
charge 0 327 58
is 0 327 58
that 0 327 58
Cohen 0 327 58
used 0 327 58
monies 0 327 58
raised 0 327 58
for 0 327 58
a 0 327 58
political 0 327 58
campaign 0 327 58
to 0 327 58
pay 0 327 58
off 0 327 58
two 0 327 58
women, 0 327 58
who 0 327 58
saw 0 327 58
and 0 327 58
capitalized 0 327 58
on 0 327 58
an 0 327 58
opportunity 0 327 58
to 0 327 58
extort 0 327 58
Trump 0 327 58
for 0 327 58
money, 0 327 58
and 0 327 58
this 0 327 58
was 0 327 58
an 0 327 58
illegal 0 327 58
use 0 327 58
of 0 327 58
the 0 327 58
money. 0 327 58

Why 1 327 59
a 1 327 59
lawyer 1 327 59
would 1 327 59
pay 1 327 59
off 1 327 59
women, 1 327 59
whose 1 327 59
stories 1 327 59
might 1 327 59
or 1 327 59
might 1 327 59
not 1 327 59
be 1 327 59
true, 1 327 59
in 1 327 59
an 1 327 59
illegal 1 327 59
way 1 327 59
when 1 327 59
his 1 327 59
client 1 327 59
is 1 327 59
a 1 327 59
multi-billionaire 1 327 59
doesn’t 1 327 59
make 1 327 59
much 1 327 59
sense. 1 327 59

But 1 327 60
these 1 327 60
are 1 327 60
not 1 327 60
the 1 327 60
kind 1 327 60
of 1 327 60
questions 1 327 60
that 1 327 60
the 1 327 60
presstitutes 1 327 60
are 1 327 60
interested 1 327 60
in. 1 327 60

Nevertheless, 0 327 61
Cohen’s 0 327 61
plea 0 327 61
is 0 327 61
associated 0 327 61
with 0 327 61
a 0 327 61
case 0 327 61
brought 0 327 61
by 0 327 61
another 0 327 61
prosecutor, 0 327 61
not 0 327 61
by 0 327 61
Special 0 327 61
Prosecutor 0 327 61
Mueller. 0 327 61

I 0 327 62
am 0 327 62
not 0 327 62
sufficiently 0 327 62
familiar 0 327 62
with 0 327 62
US 0 327 62
legal 0 327 62
procedures 0 327 62
to 0 327 62
be 0 327 62
able 0 327 62
to 0 327 62
say 0 327 62
how 0 327 62
this 0 327 62
gets 0 327 62
brought 0 327 62
back 0 327 62
into 0 327 62
Mueller’s 0 327 62
investigation. 0 327 62

The 0 327 63
facts 0 327 63
are 0 327 63
this: 0 327 63

The 0 327 64
US 0 327 64
military/security 0 327 64
complex 0 327 64
will 0 327 64
not 0 327 64
permit 0 327 64
any 0 327 64
normalization 0 327 64
of 0 327 64
relations 0 327 64
with 0 327 64
Russia. 0 327 64

Period. 0 327 65

At 0 327 66
some 0 327 66
point 0 327 66
Putin 0 327 66
and 0 327 66
Lavrov 0 327 66

the 0 327 66
idiot 0 327 66
Russian 0 327 66
Atlanticist 0 327 66

have 0 327 66
to 0 327 66
acknowledge 0 327 66
this 0 327 66
fact, 0 327 66
or 0 327 66
Russia 0 327 66
will 0 327 66
be 0 327 66
destroyed. 0 327 66

Trump, 0 327 67
by 0 327 67
declaring 0 327 67
normalization 0 327 67
of 0 327 67
relations 0 327 67

By 0 327 68

Trump 0 327 69
will 0 327 69
never 0 327 69
be 0 327 69
forgiven 0 327 69
for 0 327 69

President 0 327 72
Trump 0 327 72
stands 0 327 72
up 0 327 72
for 0 327 72
himself 0 327 72
on 0 327 72

— 0 327 72
I 0 327 72
am 0 327 72
surprised 0 327 72
that 0 327 72
Tritter 0 327 72
hasn’t 0 327 72

— 0 327 72
but 0 327 72
otherwise 0 327 72
seems 0 327 72
powerless. 0 327 72

Whoever 0 327 73
advised 0 327 73
Trump 0 327 73
to 0 327 73
appoint 0 327 73
Rosenstein, 0 327 73
a 1 327 73
person 1 327 73
committed 1 327 73
to 1 327 73
Trump’s 1 327 73
destruction, 1 327 73
as 0 327 73
deputy 0 327 73
attorney 0 327 73
general, 0 327 73
which 0 327 73
is 0 327 73
the 0 327 73
ruling 0 327 73
position 0 327 73
in 0 327 73
view 0 327 73
of 0 327 73
the 0 327 73
weak 0 327 73
and 0 327 73
stupid 0 327 73
AG 0 327 73
Sessions 0 327 73
who 0 327 73
recused 0 327 73
himself 0 327 73
from 0 327 73
the 0 327 73
Russiagate 0 327 73
investigation, 0 327 73
intended 0 327 73
Trump’s 0 327 73
destruction. 0 327 73

A 0 327 74
disreputable 0 327 74
person 0 327 74
committed 0 327 74
to 0 327 74
Trump’s 0 327 74
destruction 0 327 74
is 0 327 74
appointed 0 327 74
by 0 327 74
Trump 0 327 74
to 0 327 74
destroy 0 327 74
Trump. 0 327 74

How 0 327 75
can 0 327 75
a 0 327 75
person 0 327 75
so 0 327 75
unclued 0 327 75
survive? 0 327 75

As 0 327 76
I 0 327 76
wrote 0 327 76
during 0 327 76
the 0 327 76
presidential 0 327 76
campaign, 0 327 76
Trump 0 327 76
has 0 327 76
no 0 327 76
idea 0 327 76
of 0 327 76
Washington 0 327 76
and 0 327 76
no 0 327 76
idea 0 327 76
who 0 327 76
to 0 327 76
appoint 0 327 76
who 0 327 76
would 0 327 76
support 0 327 76
him 0 327 76
rather 0 327 76
than 0 327 76
work 0 327 76
against 0 327 76
him. 0 327 76

Consequently, 0 327 77
he 0 327 77
has 0 327 77
a 0 327 77
government 0 327 77
working 0 327 77
against 0 327 77
him. 0 327 77

Senators 0 327 78
John 0 327 78
McCain 0 327 78
and 0 327 78
Lindsey 0 327 78
Graham 0 327 78
are 0 327 78
working 0 327 78
to 0 327 78
prevent 0 327 78
the 0 327 78
Republican 0 327 78
Party 0 327 78
from 0 327 78
supporting 0 327 78
the 0 327 78
party’s 0 327 78
president. 0 327 78

They 0 327 79
could 0 327 79
easily 0 327 79
succeed. 0 327 79

What 0 327 81
can 0 327 81
President 0 327 81
Trump 0 327 81
do? 0 327 81

He 0 327 82

not 0 327 82

inexplicable 0 327 99
actions 0 327 99

Militarily, 0 327 100
Israel 0 327 100
is 0 327 100
of 0 327 100
no 0 327 100

Israel 0 327 102

to 0 327 102
try 0 327 102
it 0 327 102
a 0 327 102
third 0 327 102
time, 0 327 102
and 0 327 102
is 0 327 102
relying 0 327 102
on 0 327 102
the 0 327 102
stupid 0 327 102
Americans 0 327 102

the 0 327 102

at 1 327 103
America 1 327 103

Israel, 1 327 103
and 0 327 103
what 0 327 103
does 0 327 103
the 0 327 103
world 0 327 103
see? 0 327 103

Two 0 327 104
countries, 0 327 104
both 0 327 104
the 0 327 104
result 0 327 104
of 0 327 104
exterminating 0 327 104
the 0 327 104
native 0 327 104
populations, 0 327 104
distrusted 0 327 104
and 0 327 104
universally 0 327 104
hated, 0 327 104
both 0 327 104
of 0 327 104
which 0 327 104
survive 0 327 104
by 0 327 104
purhasing 0 327 104
the 0 327 104
governments 0 327 104
of 0 327 104
other 0 327 104
countries 0 327 104
and 0 327 104
by 0 327 104
endless 0 327 104
lies 0 327 104
that 0 327 104
describe 0 327 104
everyone 0 327 104
but 0 327 104
themselves 0 327 104
and 0 327 104
their 0 327 104
vassals 0 327 104
as 0 327 104
evil 0 327 104
criminals 0 327 104
that 0 327 104
must 0 327 104
be 0 327 104
destroyed. 0 327 104

For 0 327 105
example, 0 327 105
the 0 327 105
Gaza 0 327 105

world, 0 327 105
is 0 327 105
being 0 327 105
systematically 0 327 105
destroyed 0 327 105
along 0 327 105
with 0 327 105
all 0 327 105
life 0 327 105
within 0 327 105
it 0 327 105
by 0 327 105
Israel 0 327 105
under 1 327 105
cover 1 327 105
of 1 327 105
the 1 327 105
obvious 1 327 105
and 1 327 105
transparanent 1 327 105
lie 1 327 105
that 0 327 105
all 0 327 105
within 0 327 105
Gaza 0 327 105
are 0 327 105
terrorists 0 327 105
outfitted 0 327 105
with 0 327 105
bomb 0 327 105

who 0 327 105
are 0 327 105

to 0 327 105
the 0 327 105
destruction 0 327 105
of 0 327 105
Israel. 0 327 105

Not 0 327 106
only 0 327 106
men 0 327 106
of 0 327 106
fighting 0 327 106
age, 0 327 106
but 0 327 106
also 0 327 106
old 0 327 106
men, 0 327 106
pregnant 0 327 106
women, 0 327 106

all 0 327 106
Palestinians 0 327 106

murdered 0 327 106
by 0 327 106
the 0 327 106
Israeli 0 327 106
military. 0 327 106

States 0 327 107
Secretary 0 327 107
of 0 327 107
State 0 327 107
agrees 0 327 107
with 0 327 107
Israel 0 327 107
that 0 327 107
all 0 327 107
Palestinians 0 327 107
must 0 327 107
be 0 327 107
destroyed, 0 327 107
the 1 327 107
sooner 1 327 107
the 1 327 107

The 0 327 108
Chinese 0 327 108
are 0 327 108
busy 0 327 108
taking 0 327 108
advantage 0 327 108
of 0 327 108
the 0 327 108
financial 0 327 108
opportunities 0 327 108
that 0 327 108
the 1 327 108
idiot 1 327 108
Americans 1 327 108
forfeit, 0 327 108
but 0 327 108
otherwise 0 327 108
do 0 327 108
not 0 327 108
seem 0 327 108

any 0 327 108

For 0 327 109
China, 0 327 109
money 0 327 109
is 0 327 109
now 0 327 109

The 0 327 110
Russians 0 327 110

with 0 327 110

Slowly, 0 327 111
if 0 327 111
not 0 327 111
surely, 0 327 111
the 0 327 111

The 1 327 119

It’s 0 344 7
all 0 344 7
about 0 344 7
Glazov’s 0 344 7
new 0 344 7

At 0 344 8
FrontPage 0 344 8

where 0 344 8
he 0 344 8
is 0 344 8

he 0 344 8
had 0 344 8

which 0 344 8
included 0 344 8
recommendations 0 344 8
such 0 344 8
as 0 344 8
“Label 0 344 8

That 0 344 9
apparently 0 344 9
was 0 344 9
too 0 344 9
much 0 344 9
for 0 344 9

Glazov 0 344 24

subject 0 344 24
in 0 344 24

In 0 344 25
his 0 344 25
“9 0 344 25

he 0 344 25
points 0 344 25
out 0 344 25
that 0 344 25
the 0 344 25
Obama 0 344 25

The 1 344 26
government 1 344 26

to 1 344 26
“implement 1 344 26
a 1 344 26
concrete 1 344 26
‘countering-jihad’ 1 344 26
strategy.” 1 344 26

And 1 344 27
he 1 344 27
said 1 344 27
it 1 344 27
needs 1 344 27
to 1 344 27
affirm 1 344 27
“Shariah’s 1 344 27

They 0 349 2
have 0 349 2
resorted 0 349 2
to 0 349 2
peddling 0 349 2
an 0 349 2
allegation 0 349 2
of 0 349 2
sexual 0 349 2
misconduct 0 349 2
against 0 349 2
Judge 0 349 2

that 0 349 2
supposedly 0 349 2
occurred 0 349 2
while 0 349 2
the 0 349 2

in 0 349 2

The 0 349 3

She 0 349 4

until 0 349 4
this 0 349 4
Sunday 0 349 4
to 0 349 4

The 0 349 5
accuser’s 0 349 5

is 0 349 5
Christine 0 349 5

Judge 0 349 6
Kavanaugh 0 349 6
issued 0 349 6
a 0 349 6
statement 0 349 6
on 0 349 6
Friday 0 349 6
in 0 349 6
which 0 349 6
he 0 349 6
said, 0 349 6
"I 0 349 6

unequivocally 1 349 6

allegation. 0 349 6

I 0 349 7
did 0 349 7
not 0 349 7
do 0 349 7
this 0 349 7
back 0 349 7
in 0 349 7

Senator 0 349 8
Dianne 0 349 8
Feinstein 0 349 8
(D-Calif.), 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
ranking 0 349 8

on 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
Senate 0 349 8

Committee 0 349 8
that 0 349 8
heard 0 349 8
Judge 0 349 8

public 0 349 8
testimony 0 349 8
earlier 0 349 8
this 0 349 8
month 0 349 8
during 0 349 8
his 0 349 8
Supreme 0 349 8
Court 0 349 8
confirmation 0 349 8
hearing, 0 349 8
had 0 349 8
received 0 349 8
last 0 349 8
July 0 349 8
a 0 349 8
copy 0 349 8
of 0 349 8
a 0 349 8
letter 0 349 8
written 0 349 8
by 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
woman 0 349 8
making 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
charge, 0 349 8
who 0 349 8
we 0 349 8
now 0 349 8
know 0 349 8
was 0 349 8
Ms. 0 349 8
Ford. 0 349 8

Even 0 349 9
though 0 349 9
Senator 0 349 9
Feinstein 0 349 9
had 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
letter 0 349 9
in 0 349 9
hand, 0 349 9
she 0 349 9
never 0 349 9
brought 0 349 9
up 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
charge 0 349 9
during 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
public 0 349 9
hearing, 0 349 9
nor 0 349 9
during 0 349 9
her 0 349 9
own 0 349 9
meeting 0 349 9
with 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
judge. 0 349 9

Instead, 0 349 10
Senator 0 349 10
Feinstein 0 349 10
sat 0 349 10
on 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
letter 0 349 10
until 0 349 10
late 0 349 10
last 0 349 10
week, 0 349 10
when 0 349 10
she 0 349 10
issued 0 349 10
a 0 349 10
cryptic 0 349 10
release 0 349 10
stating 0 349 10
that 0 349 10
she 0 349 10
had 0 349 10
received 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
letter 0 349 10
but 0 349 10
did 0 349 10
not 0 349 10
want 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
give 0 349 10
more 0 349 10
details 0 349 10
in 0 349 10
deference 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
woman’s 0 349 10
wish 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
keep 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
matter 0 349 10
confidential. 0 349 10

Senator 0 349 11
Feinstein 0 349 11
turned 0 349 11
the 0 349 11
letter 0 349 11
over 0 349 11
to 0 349 11
the 0 349 11
FBI. 0 349 11

The 0 349 12
FBI 0 349 12
placed 0 349 12
the 0 349 12
letter 0 349 12
in 0 349 12
its 0 349 12
background 0 349 12
file 0 349 12
on 0 349 12
Judge 0 349 12
Kavanaugh 0 349 12
but 0 349 12
decided 0 349 12
not 0 349 12
to 0 349 12
pursue 0 349 12
any 0 349 12
further 0 349 12
investigation. 0 349 12

Senator 0 349 13
Feinstein 0 349 13
had 0 349 13
initially 0 349 13
resisted 0 349 13
sharing 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
contents 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
letter 0 349 13
with 0 349 13
her 0 349 13
fellow 0 349 13
Democrat 0 349 13
members 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
Senate 0 349 13
Judiciary 0 349 13
Committee 0 349 13
or 0 349 13
to 0 349 13
go 0 349 13
public 0 349 13
with 0 349 13
its 0 349 13
existence 0 349 13
because 0 349 13
“the 0 349 13
incident 0 349 13
was 0 349 13
too 0 349 13
distant 0 349 13
in 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
past 0 349 13
to 0 349 13
merit 0 349 13
public 0 349 13
discussion” 0 349 13
and 0 349 13
she 0 349 13
had 0 349 13
already 0 349 13
“taken 0 349 13
care 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
it,” 0 349 13
according 0 349 13
to 0 349 13

quoted 0 349 13
by 0 349 13
The 0 349 13
New 0 349 13

Nevertheless, 0 349 14
Senator 0 349 14
Feinstein 0 349 14
evidently 0 349 14
bowed 0 349 14
to 0 349 14
pressure 0 349 14
from 0 349 14
her 0 349 14
leftist 1 349 14

to 0 349 14
find 0 349 14
a 0 349 14
way 0 349 14
to 0 349 14

she 0 349 16
called 0 349 16
her 0 349 16
“civic 0 349 16

to 0 349 19
the 0 349 19
Washington 0 349 19

that 0 349 19

corralled 0 349 19
her 0 349 19
into 0 349 19
a 0 349 19

While 0 349 20
his 0 349 20
friend 0 349 20
watched, 0 349 20
she 0 349 20
said, 0 349 20
Kavanaugh 0 349 20
pinned 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
to 0 349 20
a 0 349 20
bed 0 349 20
on 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
back 0 349 20
and 0 349 20
groped 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
over 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
clothes, 0 349 20
grinding 0 349 20
his 0 349 20
body 0 349 20
against 0 349 20
hers 0 349 20
and 0 349 20
clumsily 0 349 20
attempting 0 349 20

off 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
one-piece 0 349 20

she 0 349 21
tried 0 349 21
to 0 349 21
scream, 0 349 21
she 0 349 21
said, 0 349 21
he 0 349 21

Ms. 0 349 23
Ford 0 349 23

she 0 349 23
was 0 349 23
able 0 349 23
to 0 349 23

without 0 349 23
any 0 349 23
apparent 0 349 23
further 0 349 23

after 0 349 23
“Kavanaugh’s 0 349 23

tumbling.” 0 349 23

Here 0 349 24
is 0 349 24
where 0 349 24
Ms. 0 349 24
Ford’s 0 349 24
story 0 349 24
becomes 0 349 24
quite 0 349 24
murky 0 349 24
and 0 349 24
begins 0 349 24
to 0 349 24
fall 0 349 24
apart. 0 349 24

Although 0 349 25
Ms. 0 349 25
Ford 0 349 25
believes 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
alleged 0 349 25
incident 0 349 25
occurred 0 349 25
during 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
summer 0 349 25
of 0 349 25
1982, 0 349 25
she 0 349 25
“said 0 349 25
she 0 349 25
does 0 349 25
not 0 349 25
remember 0 349 25
some 0 349 25
key 0 349 25
details 0 349 25
of 0 349 25

to 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
Washington 0 349 25

For 0 349 26
example, 0 349 26
Ms. 0 349 26
Ford 0 349 26
“said 0 349 26
she 0 349 26

She 0 349 26
also 0 349 26

she 0 349 26
got 0 349 26
home. 0 349 26

Yet 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
claims 0 349 27
to 0 349 27
be 0 349 27
absolutely 0 349 27
certain 0 349 27
that 0 349 27
Kavanaugh, 0 349 27
whom 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
presumably 0 349 27
knew 0 349 27
only 0 349 27
as 0 349 27
an 0 349 27
acquaintance 0 349 27
and 0 349 27
said 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
had 0 349 27
not 0 349 27
spoken 0 349 27
to 0 349 27
since 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
night 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
incident 0 349 27
allegedly 0 349 27
occurred, 0 349 27
was 0 349 27
involved 0 349 27
in 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
alleged 0 349 27
incident. 0 349 27

Ms. 0 349 28
Ford 0 349 28
admitted 0 349 28
that 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
“told 0 349 28
no 0 349 28
one 0 349 28
at 0 349 28
the 0 349 28
time 0 349 28
what 0 349 28
had 0 349 28
happened 0 349 28
to 0 349 28
her.” 0 349 28
In 0 349 28
fact, 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
said 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
recalled 0 349 28
thinking: 0 349 28
“I’m 0 349 28
not 0 349 28
ever 0 349 28
telling 0 349 28
anyone 0 349 28
this. 0 349 28

This 0 349 29
is 0 349 29
nothing, 0 349 29
it 0 349 29
didn’t 0 349 29
happen, 0 349 29
and 0 349 29
he 0 349 29
didn’t 0 349 29
rape 0 349 29
me.” 0 349 29
Even 0 349 29
if 0 349 29
one 0 349 29
explains 0 349 29
this 0 349 29
behavior 0 349 29
as 0 349 29
the 0 349 29
natural 0 349 29
reaction 0 349 29
of 0 349 29
a 0 349 29
frightened 0 349 29
teenager 0 349 29
to 0 349 29
a 0 349 29
highly 0 349 29
traumatic 0 349 29
incident, 0 349 29
that 0 349 29
does 0 349 29
not 0 349 29
explain 0 349 29
why, 0 349 29
by 0 349 29
her 0 349 29
own 0 349 29
admission, 0 349 29
she 0 349 29
“told 0 349 29
no 0 349 29
one 0 349 29
of 0 349 29
the 0 349 29

the 0 349 29
Washington 0 349 29

Most 0 349 30
revealingly, 0 349 30
the 0 349 30
article 0 349 30
reported 0 349 30
on 0 349 30
a 0 349 30
gaping 1 349 30

The 0 349 31

not 0 349 31

say 0 349 31
she 0 349 31
reported 0 349 31
that 0 349 31

not 0 349 32
mention 0 349 32
Judge 0 349 32
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 32
name. 0 349 32

Judge 0 349 33
Kavanaugh 0 349 33
has 0 349 33
had 0 349 33
extensive 0 349 33
background 0 349 33
checks 0 349 33
performed 0 349 33
on 0 349 33
him 0 349 33
in 0 349 33
the 0 349 33
past 0 349 33
for 0 349 33
his 0 349 33
various 0 349 33
federal 0 349 33
government 0 349 33
positions, 0 349 33
including 0 349 33
for 0 349 33

ever 0 349 33

Ms. 1 349 34
Ford 1 349 34
may 1 349 34
believe 1 349 34
her 1 349 34
story 1 349 34
to 1 349 34
be 1 349 34
true, 1 349 34
but 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
lack 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
any 1 349 34
credible 1 349 34
corroborating 1 349 34
evidence, 1 349 34
her 1 349 34

of 1 349 34
details 1 349 34
surrounding 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
alleged 1 349 34

the 1 349 34
absence 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
any 1 349 34
pattern 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
such 1 349 34
sexual 1 349 34
misconduct 1 349 34
by 1 349 34
Judge 1 349 34
Kavanaugh 1 349 34
undercut 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
reliability 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
her 1 349 34
version 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
incident. 1 349 34

In 0 349 35

school 0 349 35
vouched 0 349 35
for 0 349 35
his 0 349 35
character: 0 349 35

We 0 349 36
are 0 349 36
women 0 349 36
who 0 349 36
have 0 349 36
known 0 349 36
Brett 0 349 36

for 0 349 36
more 0 349 36
than 0 349 36
35 0 349 36
years 0 349 36
and 0 349 36
knew 0 349 36
him 0 349 36
while 0 349 36
he 0 349 36
attended 0 349 36
high 0 349 36
school 0 349 36
between 0 349 36
1979 0 349 36
and 0 349 36
1983. 0 349 36

For 1 349 37
the 1 349 37
entire 1 349 37
time 1 349 37
we 1 349 37
have 1 349 37
known 1 349 37
Brett 1 349 37
Kavanaugh, 1 349 37
he 1 349 37
has 1 349 37
behaved 1 349 37
honorably 1 349 37
and 1 349 37
treated 1 349 37
women 1 349 37
with 1 349 37
respect… 1 349 37
Brett 0 349 37
attended 0 349 37
Georgetown 0 349 37
Prep, 0 349 37
an 0 349 37
all-boys 0 349 37
high 0 349 37
school 0 349 37
in 0 349 37
Rockville, 0 349 37
Maryland. 0 349 37

He 0 349 38
was 0 349 38
an 0 349 38
outstanding 0 349 38
student 0 349 38
and 0 349 38
athlete 0 349 38
with 0 349 38
a 0 349 38
wide 0 349 38
circle 0 349 38
of 0 349 38
friends. 0 349 38

Almost 0 349 39
all 0 349 39
of 0 349 39
us 0 349 39
attended 0 349 39
all-girls 0 349 39
high 0 349 39
schools 0 349 39
in 0 349 39
the 0 349 39
area. 0 349 39

We 0 349 40
knew 0 349 40
Brett 0 349 40
well 0 349 40
through 0 349 40
social 0 349 40
events, 0 349 40
sports, 0 349 40
church, 0 349 40
and 0 349 40
various 0 349 40
other 0 349 40
activities. 0 349 40

Many 0 349 41
of 0 349 41
us 0 349 41
have 0 349 41
remained 0 349 41
close 0 349 41
friends 0 349 41
with 0 349 41
him 0 349 41
and 0 349 41
his 0 349 41
family 0 349 41
over 0 349 41
the 0 349 41
years. 0 349 41

Through 0 349 42
the 0 349 42
more 0 349 42
than 0 349 42
35 0 349 42
years 0 349 42
we 0 349 42
have 0 349 42
known 0 349 42
him, 0 349 42
Brett 0 349 42
has 0 349 42
stood 0 349 42
out 0 349 42
for 0 349 42
his 0 349 42
friendship, 0 349 42
character, 0 349 42
and 0 349 42
integrity. 0 349 42

In 0 349 43
particular, 0 349 43
he 0 349 43
has 0 349 43
always 0 349 43
treated 0 349 43
women 0 349 43
with 0 349 43
decency 0 349 43
and 0 349 43
respect. 0 349 43

That 0 349 44
was 0 349 44
true 0 349 44
when 0 349 44
he 0 349 44
was 0 349 44
in 0 349 44
high 0 349 44
school, 0 349 44
and 0 349 44
it 0 349 44
has 0 349 44
remained 0 349 44
true 0 349 44
to 0 349 44
this 0 349 44
day. 0 349 44

The 0 349 45
signers 0 349 45
of 0 349 45
this 0 349 45
letter 0 349 45
hold 0 349 45
a 0 349 45
broad 0 349 45
range 0 349 45
of 0 349 45
political 0 349 45
views. 0 349 45

Many 0 349 46
of 0 349 46
us 0 349 46
are 0 349 46
not 0 349 46
lawyers, 0 349 46
but 0 349 46
we 0 349 46
know 0 349 46
Brett 0 349 46
Kavanaugh 0 349 46
as 0 349 46
a 0 349 46
person. 0 349 46

And 0 349 47
he 0 349 47
has 0 349 47
always 0 349 47
been 0 349 47
a 0 349 47
good 0 349 47
person. 0 349 47

Nevertheless, 0 349 48
using 0 349 48
their 1 349 48
standard 1 349 48
contemptible, 1 349 48
obstructionist 1 349 48
tactics, 1 349 48
the 0 349 48
Democrats 0 349 48
opposed 0 349 48
to 0 349 48
Judge 0 349 48
Kavanaugh 0 349 48
happily 0 349 48
seized 0 349 48
on 0 349 48
the 0 349 48
unsubstantiated 0 349 48
allegation 0 349 48
of 0 349 48
teen 0 349 48
sexual 0 349 48
misbehavior 0 349 48
in 0 349 48
high 0 349 48
school 0 349 48
to 0 349 48
assassinate 1 349 48
Judge 1 349 48
Kavanaugh’s 1 349 48
character. 1 349 48

They 0 349 49
have 0 349 49
done 0 349 49
so 0 349 49
in 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
face 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
Judge 0 349 49
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 49
lifetime 0 349 49
record 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
stellar 0 349 49
public 0 349 49
service, 0 349 49
multiple 0 349 49
background 0 349 49
checks 0 349 49
producing 0 349 49
no 0 349 49
evidence 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
sexual 0 349 49
misconduct, 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
letter 0 349 49
written 0 349 49
by 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
65 0 349 49
women, 0 349 49
who 0 349 49
knew 0 349 49
him 0 349 49
when 0 349 49
he 0 349 49
was 0 349 49
in 0 349 49
high 0 349 49
school 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
thereafter 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
who 0 349 49
signed 0 349 49
their 0 349 49
names 0 349 49
to 0 349 49
a 0 349 49
ringing 0 349 49
endorsement 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
his 0 349 49
good 0 349 49
character. 0 349 49

Feminists 0 349 50

were 1 349 50
in 1 349 50
line 1 349 50
with 1 349 50
their 1 349 50
ideology. 1 349 50

presumably 0 349 51
also 0 349 51

In 0 81 2
an 0 81 2

with 0 81 2
Hill.TV 0 81 2
yesterday, 0 81 2
the 0 81 2

he 0 81 2
ordered 0 81 2

FBI 0 81 2
investigation 0 81 2
of 0 81 2
the 0 81 2
conspiracy 0 81 2

began 0 81 2
as 1 81 2
a 1 81 2
“hoax.” 1 81 2
Exposing 0 81 2
it 0 81 2
could 0 81 2
be 0 81 2
one 1 81 2
of 1 81 2
the 1 81 2
“crowning 1 81 2
achievements” 1 81 2
of 1 81 2
his 1 81 2
presidency, 1 81 2
he 0 81 2
said. 0 81 2

“What 1 81 3
we’ve 1 81 3
done 1 81 3
is 1 81 3
a 1 81 3
great 1 81 3
service 1 81 3
to 1 81 3
the 1 81 3
country, 1 81 3
really,” 1 81 3
he 0 81 3
said. 0 81 3

“I 0 81 4
hope 0 81 4
to 0 81 4
be 0 81 4
able 0 81 4
to 0 81 4

along 0 81 4
with 0 81 4
tax 0 81 4

regulation 0 81 4
and 0 81 4
all 0 81 4
the 0 81 4
things 0 81 4
I’ve 0 81 4
done… 0 81 4
in 0 81 4
its 0 81 4
own 0 81 4
way 0 81 4
this 1 81 4
might 1 81 4
be 1 81 4
the 1 81 4
most 1 81 4
important 1 81 4
thing 1 81 4
because 0 81 4
this 0 81 4
was 0 81 4
corrupt.” 0 81 4

Trump 0 81 5
criticized 0 81 5
how 0 81 5
the 0 81 5
FBI 0 81 5
handled 0 81 5
the 0 81 5
Russia 0 81 5
probe, 0 81 5
accusing 0 81 5
it 0 81 5
of 0 81 5

campaign. 0 81 5

“They 0 81 6
know 0 81 6

is 1 81 6
one 1 81 6

in 1 81 6
the 1 81 6
history 1 81 6
of 1 81 6
our 1 81 6
country 1 81 6
because 0 81 6
basically 0 81 6
what 0 81 6
they 0 81 6
did 0 81 6
is, 0 81 6
they 0 81 6

think 0 81 6
he’s 0 81 6
been 0 81 6
treated 0 81 6
very 0 81 6
badly. 0 81 6

They 0 81 7
used 1 81 7

Although 1 81 11
the 1 81 11
conspiracy 1 81 11

is 1 81 11
baseless 1 81 11

it 1 81 11
continues 1 81 11
to 1 81 11

back, 0 81 12

them. 0 81 12

This 0 81 13
declassification 0 81 13
effort 0 81 13
won’t 0 81 13
make 0 81 13
things 0 81 13

does 0 81 15

There 0 81 17

back 0 360 2
in 0 360 2
the 0 360 2

They 1 360 3
deliberately 1 360 3
refused 1 360 3
to 1 360 3
bring 1 360 3
up 1 360 3
the 1 360 3
allegations, 1 360 3
as 1 360 3
weak 1 360 3
and 1 360 3
ridiculous 1 360 3
as 1 360 3
they 1 360 3
are, 1 360 3
at 1 360 3
Kavanaugh’s 1 360 3
Senate 1 360 3

because 1 360 3
they 1 360 3
didn’t 1 360 3
want 1 360 3
to 1 360 3
have 1 360 3
a 1 360 3
rational 1 360 3

They 0 360 4
wanted 0 360 4
to 0 360 4
hurl 1 360 4
the 1 360 4
wild 1 360 4
claims 1 360 4
like 1 360 4

on 0 360 11

by 0 360 11
an 0 360 11
uncomfortably 0 360 11
close 0 360 11
margin 0 360 11
of 0 360 11

Christine 0 360 12

Ford’s 0 360 12
lawyers 0 360 12
are 0 360 12
trying 0 360 12
to 0 360 12
game 0 360 12
the 0 360 12
system. 0 360 12

They 0 360 13
know 0 360 13
that 0 360 13
Senate 0 360 13
Judiciary 0 360 13
Committee 0 360 13
rules 0 360 13
require 0 360 13
Chairman 0 360 13
Chuck 0 360 13
Grassley 0 360 13
(R-Iowa) 0 360 13
to 0 360 13
provide 0 360 13
a 0 360 13
full 0 360 13
week’s 0 360 13
notice 0 360 13
for 0 360 13
a 0 360 13
hearing. 0 360 13

So, 0 360 14
if, 0 360 14
for 0 360 14
example, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
committee 0 360 14
followed 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
rules 0 360 14
and 0 360 14
agreed 0 360 14
Friday 0 360 14
(today) 0 360 14
to 0 360 14
a 0 360 14
hearing, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
soonest 0 360 14
it 0 360 14
could 0 360 14
be 0 360 14
held 0 360 14
would 0 360 14
be 0 360 14
next 0 360 14
Friday, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
final 0 360 14
business 0 360 14

before 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
Supreme 0 360 14
Court’s 0 360 14
new 0 360 14

begins. 0 360 14

Of 0 360 15
course, 0 360 15
lawyers 1 360 15
are 1 360 15
masters 1 360 15
of 1 360 15

President 1 360 15
Trump’s 1 360 15
agenda 1 360 15
have 0 360 15
an 0 360 15
added 0 360 15
incentive 0 360 15
to 0 360 15
drag 0 360 15
the 0 360 15

out 0 360 15
as 0 360 15

possible. 0 360 15

New 0 360 16
demands 0 360 16
and 0 360 16
fake 0 360 16
emergencies 0 360 16
are 0 360 16
bound 0 360 16
to 0 360 16
arise 0 360 16
from 0 360 16
Ford’s 0 360 16
legal 0 360 16
team. 0 360 16

It 0 360 17
was 0 360 17
unclear 0 360 17
at 0 360 17
press 0 360 17
time 0 360 17
if 0 360 17
the 0 360 17
public 0 360 17
hearing 0 360 17
scheduled 0 360 17
for 0 360 17
Monday 0 360 17
into 0 360 17
the 0 360 17
allegations 0 360 17
of 0 360 17
sexual 0 360 17
misconduct 0 360 17
against 0 360 17
Kavanaugh 0 360 17
would 0 360 17
go 0 360 17
forward. 0 360 17

Kavanaugh 0 360 18
informed 0 360 18
the 0 360 18
committee 0 360 18
he 0 360 18
was 0 360 18
willing 0 360 18
to 0 360 18
testify 0 360 18
Monday. 0 360 18

“I 0 360 19
continue 0 360 19
to 0 360 19

as 0 360 19
soon 0 360 19
as 0 360 19

that 0 360 19
I 0 360 19
can 0 360 19
clear 0 360 19
my 0 360 19
name," 0 360 19
he 0 360 19
wrote 0 360 19
in 0 360 19
a 0 360 19
letter. 0 360 19

Ford's 0 360 20
lawyer 0 360 20
Debra 0 360 20
Katz 0 360 20
told 0 360 20
the 0 360 20
Judiciary 0 360 20
Committee 0 360 20
her 0 360 20
client 0 360 20
"wishes 0 360 20

Another 0 360 21
Ford 0 360 21
attorney 0 360 21
reportedly 0 360 21
said 0 360 21
Wednesday 0 360 21
that 0 360 21
there 0 360 21
are 0 360 21
“multiple 0 360 21
witnesses” 0 360 21
who 0 360 21

"A 0 360 22

that 0 360 22

Katz 0 360 22
wrote 0 360 22
in 0 360 22
a 0 360 22
letter. 0 360 22

“Dr. 0 360 23

the 0 360 27
Judiciary 0 360 27
Committee 0 360 27
chairman, 0 360 27
said 0 360 27
that 0 360 27
his 0 360 27
staff 0 360 27
had 0 360 27
discussed 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
issue 0 360 27
with 0 360 27
Ford’s 0 360 27
attorney 0 360 27
earlier 0 360 27
in 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
day 0 360 27
and 0 360 27
that 0 360 27
he 0 360 27

Ford’s 0 360 28
offer 0 360 28
also 0 360 28
increased 0 360 28
the 0 360 28
pressure 0 360 28
on 0 360 28
several 0 360 28
key 0 360 28

Kavanaugh 0 360 29
on 0 360 29
the 0 360 29

Both 0 360 30
were 0 360 30
already 0 360 30
facing 0 360 30

pressure 0 360 30
from 0 360 30
abortion 0 360 30

conservative 1 360 30
and 0 360 30
longtime 0 360 30

which 0 360 31
the 0 360 31

upended 0 360 31
his 0 360 31
seemingly 0 360 31
sure-bet 0 360 31
confirmation 0 360 31

only 0 360 31
increased 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
stakes 0 360 31
for 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
key 0 360 31
lawmakers. 0 360 31

Chairman 0 360 32
Grassley 0 360 32
had 0 360 32
imposed 0 360 32
a 0 360 32
Thursday 0 360 32
deadline 0 360 32
for 0 360 32
Ford 0 360 32
to 0 360 32
submit 0 360 32
testimony 0 360 32
after 0 360 32
her 0 360 32
team 0 360 32
said 0 360 32
Tuesday 0 360 32
she 0 360 32
wasn’t 0 360 32
willing 0 360 32
to 0 360 32
testify 0 360 32
until 0 360 32
the 0 360 32
FBI 0 360 32
investigates 0 360 32
her 0 360 32
sexual 0 360 32
abuse 0 360 32
allegations 0 360 32
against 0 360 32
Kavanaugh. 0 360 32

Left-wingers 1 360 33
such 0 360 33
as 0 360 33
Hillary 0 360 33

and 0 360 33
Senate 0 360 33

Leader 0 360 33
Chuck 0 360 33
Schumer 0 360 33
(D-N.Y.) 0 360 33
echoed 0 360 33
Ford’s 0 360 33
demand. 0 360 33

The 0 360 34
demand 0 360 34
for 0 360 34
an 0 360 34
FBI 0 360 34
probe 0 360 34
is 0 360 34
“utter 1 360 34
nonsense,” 1 360 34
former 0 360 34
U.S. 0 360 34
Attorney 0 360 34
Joseph 0 360 34
diGenova 0 360 34
said 0 360 34
earlier 0 360 34
this 0 360 34
week. 0 360 34

Ford 0 360 35
“really 0 360 35
doesn’t 0 360 35
want 0 360 35
to 0 360 35
testify,” 0 360 35
he 0 360 35
said. 0 360 35

“Because 0 360 36
when 0 360 36
she 0 360 36
does, 0 360 36
she 1 360 36
is 1 360 36
going 1 360 36
to 1 360 36
look 1 360 36
like 1 360 36
the 1 360 36
loon 1 360 36
she 1 360 36
is. 1 360 36

She 0 360 37
may 0 360 37
very 0 360 37
well 0 360 37
believe 0 360 37
everything 0 360 37
she’s 0 360 37
saying, 0 360 37
and 0 360 37
that 0 360 37
is 0 360 37
one 0 360 37
of 0 360 37
the 0 360 37
signs 0 360 37
of 0 360 37
lunacy, 0 360 37
believing 0 360 37
something 0 360 37
that 0 360 37
isn’t 0 360 37
real.” 0 360 37
And 0 360 37
her 1 360 37
lawyer 1 360 37
is 1 360 37
“even 1 360 37
loonier.” 1 360 37

Besides, 0 360 38
diGenova 0 360 38
explained, 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
eleventh-hour 0 360 38
sexual 0 360 38
abuse 0 360 38
claim 0 360 38
leveled 0 360 38
against 0 360 38
Kavanaugh 0 360 38
is 0 360 38
a 0 360 38
non-federal 0 360 38
matter 0 360 38
and 0 360 38
in 0 360 38
this 0 360 38
case 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
alleged 0 360 38
assault 0 360 38
hasn’t 0 360 38
even 0 360 38
been 0 360 38
clearly 0 360 38
outlined 0 360 38
by 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
alleged 0 360 38
victim. 0 360 38

Ford 0 360 39
didn’t 0 360 39
report 0 360 39
it 0 360 39
to 0 360 39
anyone 0 360 39
for 0 360 39
decades 0 360 39
and 0 360 39
isn’t 0 360 39
even 0 360 39
certain 0 360 39
when 0 360 39
or 0 360 39
where 0 360 39
it 0 360 39
happened, 0 360 39
so 0 360 39
the 0 360 39
FBI 0 360 39
can’t 0 360 39
investigate 0 360 39
the 0 360 39
matter 0 360 39
“because 0 360 39
there 0 360 39
is 0 360 39
nothing 0 360 39
to 0 360 39
investigate.” 0 360 39

Kavanaugh 0 360 40
has 0 360 40
already 0 360 40
undergone 0 360 40
six 0 360 40
FBI 0 360 40
background 0 360 40
checks 0 360 40
and 0 360 40
the 0 360 40
agency 0 360 40
has 0 360 40
ruled 0 360 40
out 0 360 40
investigating 0 360 40
Ford’s 0 360 40
allegation 0 360 40
of 0 360 40
drunken 0 360 40
groping 0 360 40
at 0 360 40
a 0 360 40
teenagers’ 0 360 40
party 0 360 40
36 0 360 40
years 0 360 40

Ford’s 1 360 41
request 1 360 41
for 1 360 41
an 1 360 41
FBI 1 360 41
probe 1 360 41
is 1 360 41
“clearly 1 360 41
a 1 360 41
desire 1 360 41
to 1 360 41
delay 1 360 41
proceedings,” 1 360 41
diGenova 0 360 41
said. 0 360 41

President 0 360 42
Trump 0 360 42
is 0 360 42
taking 0 360 42
the 0 360 42
high 0 360 42
road 0 360 42
and 0 360 42
is 0 360 42

an 1 360 43

Wednesday, 0 360 44
President 0 360 44
Trump 0 360 44

that 0 360 45
it 0 360 45
was 0 360 45
"very 0 360 45
hard 0 360 45
for 0 360 45

between 0 360 45

an 1 360 46
extraordinary 1 360 46

– 1 360 46
I 1 360 46
think 1 360 46
he's 1 360 46
a 1 360 46

an 1 360 46
unblemished 1 360 46
record," 1 360 46
Trump 0 360 46
said. 0 360 46

"This 0 360 47
is 0 360 47

very 0 360 47

Good 0 364 0
Thing 0 364 0
- 0 364 0
Here's 0 364 0
Why 0 364 0

If 0 364 1
you 0 364 1
don’t 0 364 1
like 0 364 1
President 0 364 1
Trump 0 364 1
and 0 364 1
can’t 0 364 1
understand 0 364 1
how 0 364 1
anyone 0 364 1
could, 0 364 1
look 0 364 1
no 0 364 1
further 0 364 1
than 0 364 1
the 0 364 1
past 0 364 1
week 0 364 1
for 0 364 1
an 0 364 1
excellent 0 364 1
example 0 364 1
of 0 364 1
what 1 364 1
on 1 364 1
Earth 1 364 1
could’ve 0 364 1
made 0 364 1
a 1 364 1
man 1 364 1
promising 1 364 1
to 1 364 1
Drain 1 364 1
the 1 364 1
Swamp 1 364 1
so 0 364 1
popular. 0 364 1

The 0 364 2
Washington 0 364 2
establishment 0 364 2
politicians 0 364 2
act 1 364 2
like 1 364 2
children 1 364 2
when 0 364 2
they 0 364 2
can’t 0 364 2
have 0 364 2
their 0 364 2
way. 0 364 2

They 1 364 3
kick 1 364 3
and 1 364 3
scream 1 364 3
and 1 364 3
lie 1 364 3
and 1 364 3
pout. 1 364 3

President 1 364 4
Trump 1 364 4
is 1 364 4
the 1 364 4
anti-politician 1 364 4
and 0 364 4
when 0 364 4
Congress 0 364 4
continues 0 364 4
to 0 364 4
behave 0 364 4
like 0 364 4
this, 0 364 4
he 0 364 4
only 0 364 4
gets 0 364 4
more 0 364 4
popular. 0 364 4

President 0 364 5
Trump 0 364 5
nominated 0 364 5
Bret 0 364 5
Kavanaugh 0 364 5
to 0 364 5
the 0 364 5
supreme 0 364 5
court. 0 364 5

He’s 0 364 6
a 0 364 6
pro-life 1 364 6
judge 1 364 6
and 0 364 6
his 0 364 6
vote 0 364 6
will 0 364 6
certainly 0 364 6
tip 0 364 6
the 0 364 6
scales 0 364 6
of 0 364 6
justice 0 364 6
to 0 364 6
the 0 364 6
right. 0 364 6

The 0 364 7
power 0 364 7
that 0 364 7
the 0 364 7
Supreme 0 364 7
Court 0 364 7
has, 0 364 7
some 0 364 7
would 0 364 7
argue, 0 364 7
is 0 364 7
greater 0 364 7
in 0 364 7
certain 0 364 7
aspects 0 364 7
than 0 364 7
that 0 364 7
of 0 364 7
the 0 364 7
president 0 364 7
himself. 0 364 7

Perhaps 0 364 8
that’s 0 364 8
why 0 364 8
the 0 364 8
2016 0 364 8
election 0 364 8
loss 0 364 8
was 0 364 8
so 0 364 8
devastating 1 364 8
to 0 364 8
the 0 364 8
Democrats. 0 364 8

Trump 0 364 9
potentially 0 364 9
has 0 364 9
the 0 364 9
ability 0 364 9
to 0 364 9
nominate 0 364 9
3 0 364 9
Supreme 0 364 9
Court 0 364 9
justices 0 364 9
during 0 364 9
his 0 364 9
presidency, 0 364 9
thus 0 364 9
shaping 0 364 9
the 0 364 9
laws 0 364 9
and 0 364 9
morals 0 364 9
of 0 364 9
this 0 364 9
country 0 364 9
for 0 364 9
about 0 364 9
the 0 364 9
next 0 364 9
30 0 364 9
years. 0 364 9

Personally, 1 364 10
I 1 364 10
trust 1 364 10
very, 1 364 10
very 1 364 10
few 1 364 10
politicians 1 364 10
no 1 364 10
matter 1 364 10
the 1 364 10
party 1 364 10
that 1 364 10
they 1 364 10
claim. 1 364 10

So, 0 364 11
when 0 364 11
a 1 364 11
bunch 1 364 11
of 1 364 11
well-documented 1 364 11
liars 1 364 11
come 0 364 11
out 0 364 11
with 0 364 11
yet 0 364 11

Timing 0 364 22

The 0 364 23
most 0 364 23
suspicious 0 364 23
part 0 364 23
of 0 364 23
this 0 364 23
whole 0 364 23
situation 0 364 23
is 0 364 23
the 0 364 23
timing. 0 364 23

Christine 0 364 24
Ford 0 364 24
recalled 0 364 24
the 0 364 24
incident 0 364 24
in 0 364 24
2006 0 364 24

She's 0 364 25
known 0 364 25
about 0 364 25
this 0 364 25
for 0 364 25
over 0 364 25
ten 0 364 25
years, 0 364 25
why 0 364 25
come 0 364 25
forward 0 364 25
now? 0 364 25

She's 0 364 26
affiliated 0 364 26
with 0 364 26
the 0 364 26
democratic 0 364 26
party 0 364 26
and 0 364 26
the 0 364 26
“resist” 0 364 26
movement 0 364 26

She 0 364 27
hired 0 364 27
a 0 364 27
Clinton 0 364 27
attorney, 0 364 27
Lisa 0 364 27
Banks 0 364 27

She 0 364 28
can 0 364 28
produce 0 364 28
exactly 0 364 28
zero 0 364 28
witnesses 0 364 28

Any 0 364 29
one 0 364 29
of 0 364 29
these 0 364 29
(and 0 364 29
dozens 0 364 29
of 0 364 29
other) 0 364 29
circumstances 0 364 29
by 0 364 29
themselves 0 364 29
are 0 364 29
not 0 364 29
enough 0 364 29
to 0 364 29
dismiss 0 364 29
this 0 364 29
allegation 0 364 29
outright. 0 364 29

However, 0 364 30
taken 1 364 30
together 1 364 30
as 1 364 30
a 1 364 30
whole, 1 364 30
it’s 1 364 30
far 1 364 30
too 1 364 30
suspicious 1 364 30
to 1 364 30
lend 1 364 30
it 1 364 30
any 1 364 30
credibility. 1 364 30

Ladies, 0 364 31
you 0 364 31
demand 0 364 31
to 0 364 31
be 0 364 31
believed, 0 364 31
no 0 364 31
matter 0 364 31
what. 0 364 31

Well, 0 364 32
when 0 364 32
every 1 364 32
time 1 364 32
there's 1 364 32
a 1 364 32
man 1 364 32
that 1 364 32
you 1 364 32
don't 1 364 32
like 1 364 32
running 1 364 32
for 1 364 32
public 1 364 32
office 1 364 32
or 1 364 32
being 1 364 32
nominated 1 364 32
for 1 364 32
a 1 364 32
position, 1 364 32
some 1 364 32
woman 1 364 32
crawls 1 364 32
out 1 364 32
from 1 364 32
a 1 364 32
line 1 364 32
of 1 364 32
protesters 1 364 32
and 1 364 32
makes 1 364 32
an 1 364 32
ambiguous-at-best 1 364 32
claim 1 364 32
about 1 364 32
unwanted 1 364 32
sexual 1 364 32
advances, 1 364 32
it 0 364 32
becomes 0 364 32
increasingly 0 364 32
difficult 0 364 32
to 0 364 32
take 0 364 32
you 0 364 32
seriously. 0 364 32

No, 0 364 33
an 0 364 33
accusation 0 364 33
against 0 364 33
a 0 364 33
man 0 364 33
who 0 364 33
has 0 364 33
been 0 364 33
investigated 0 364 33
by 0 364 33
the 0 364 33
FBI 0 364 33
six 0 364 33
times 0 364 33
prior 0 364 33
and 0 364 33
has 0 364 33
75 0 364 33
women 0 364 33
publicly 0 364 33
vouching 0 364 33
for 0 364 33
his 0 364 33
character 0 364 33
is 0 364 33
not 0 364 33
going 0 364 33
to 0 364 33
stop 0 364 33
this 0 364 33
process. 0 364 33

And 0 364 34
guess 0 364 34
what, 0 364 34
next 1 364 34
time 1 364 34
a 1 364 34
man 1 364 34
is 1 364 34
nominated 1 364 34
to 1 364 34
a 1 364 34
position 1 364 34
who 1 364 34
really 1 364 34
has 1 364 34
committed 1 364 34
a 1 364 34
crime, 1 364 34
people 1 364 34
will 1 364 34
be 1 364 34
that 1 364 34
much 1 364 34
less 1 364 34
likely 1 364 34
to 1 364 34
believe 1 364 34
his 1 364 34
accuser. 1 364 34

Way 1 364 35
to 1 364 35
go! 1 364 35

By 0 364 36
attempting 0 364 36
to 0 364 36
derail 0 364 36
this 0 364 36
process 0 364 36
with 0 364 36
such 1 364 36
a 1 364 36
pathetic 1 364 36
attempt 1 364 36
at 1 364 36
a 1 364 36
smear 1 364 36
campaign, 1 364 36
you 0 364 36
have 0 364 36
successfully 0 364 36
made 0 364 36
it 0 364 36
much 0 364 36
easier 0 364 36
for 0 364 36
a 0 364 36
real 0 364 36
sex 0 364 36
offender 0 364 36
to 0 364 36
point 0 364 36
back 0 364 36
at 0 364 36
this 0 364 36
and 0 364 36
say, 0 364 36
“look, 0 364 36
this 0 364 36
is 0 364 36
what 0 364 36
they 0 364 36
do"! 0 364 36

Women 1 364 37
everywhere 1 364 37
should 1 364 37
be 1 364 37
furious. 1 364 37

As 0 364 38
an 0 364 38
outsider, 0 364 38
a 0 364 38
regular 1 364 38
Joe 1 364 38
American, 1 364 38
this 0 364 38
is 0 364 38
what 0 364 38
I 0 364 38
see: 0 364 38
Trump 0 364 38
nominates 0 364 38
a 0 364 38
very 0 364 38
well 0 364 38
known, 0 364 38
well-established 0 364 38
judge 0 364 38
to 0 364 38
the 0 364 38
supreme 0 364 38
court. 0 364 38

Immediately 0 364 39
every 0 364 39
Democrat 0 364 39
publicly 0 364 39
stated 0 364 39
that 0 364 39
they 0 364 39
would 0 364 39
vote 0 364 39
No 0 364 39
for 0 364 39
his 0 364 39
confirmation. 0 364 39

On 0 364 40
the 0 364 40
other 0 364 40
hand, 0 364 40
every 0 364 40
Republican 0 364 40
publicly 0 364 40
stated 0 364 40
that 0 364 40
they 0 364 40
would 0 364 40
vote 0 364 40
Yes. 0 364 40

Currently, 0 364 41
there's 0 364 41
more 0 364 41
Republicans 0 364 41
in 0 364 41
Congress 0 364 41
than 0 364 41
Democrats, 0 364 41
which 0 364 41
means 0 364 41
the 0 364 41
guy 0 364 41
will 0 364 41
be 0 364 41
confirmed. 0 364 41

There's 0 364 42
an 0 364 42
election 0 364 42
2 0 364 42
months 0 364 42
away. 0 364 42

The 0 364 43
Democrats 0 364 43
think 0 364 43
that 0 364 43
they'll 0 364 43
take 0 364 43
back 0 364 43
the 0 364 43
majority 0 364 43
of 0 364 43
Congress 0 364 43
and 0 364 43
will 0 364 43
thus 0 364 43
be 0 364 43
able 0 364 43
to 0 364 43
block 0 364 43
Trump's 0 364 43
nomination. 0 364 43

All 0 364 44
they 0 364 44
have 0 364 44
to 0 364 44
do 0 364 44
is 0 364 44
delay 0 364 44
the 0 364 44
confirmation 0 364 44
until 0 364 44
after 0 364 44
the 0 364 44
election. 0 364 44

So, 0 364 45
they 1 364 45
dig 1 364 45
up 1 364 45
some 1 364 45
Trump-hating 1 364 45
woman 1 364 45
from 1 364 45
Kavanaugh’s 1 364 45
past 1 364 45
and 1 364 45
convince 1 364 45
her 1 364 45
to 1 364 45
say 1 364 45
that 1 364 45
he 1 364 45
assaulted 1 364 45
her 1 364 45
thinking 1 364 45
that 1 364 45
such 1 364 45
an 1 364 45
allegation 1 364 45
will 1 364 45
surely 1 364 45
delay 1 364 45
the 1 364 45
vote 1 364 45
long 1 364 45
enough 1 364 45
for 1 364 45
them 1 364 45
to 1 364 45
regain 1 364 45
control 1 364 45
of 1 364 45
Congress. 1 364 45

It’s 0 364 46
not 0 364 46
difficult 0 364 46
to 0 364 46
see 0 364 46
through 0 364 46
this 0 364 46
plan. 0 364 46

These 0 364 47
are 0 364 47
the 0 364 47
facts. 0 364 47

This 0 364 48
is 0 364 48
not 0 364 48
my 0 364 48
opinion. 0 364 48

Everything 1 364 48

else 1 364 48

is 1 364 48

just 1 364 48

noise. 1 364 48

the 0 367 1

for 0 367 1
no 0 367 1
reason, 0 367 1
is 0 367 1
a 0 367 1

of 0 367 1

at 0 367 1
work 0 367 1
in 0 367 1

Guyger 0 367 2
claims 0 367 2
that 0 367 2
she 0 367 2
accidentally 0 367 2
entered 0 367 2
the 0 367 2
wrong 0 367 2
apartment 0 367 2
and 0 367 2
shot 0 367 2
a 0 367 2
man 0 367 2
who 0 367 2
she 0 367 2
thought 0 367 2
was 0 367 2
a 0 367 2
burglar, 0 367 2
however, 0 367 2
eyewitness 0 367 2
testimony 0 367 2
has 0 367 2
contradicted 0 367 2
her 0 367 2
initial 0 367 2
statement. 0 367 2

Despite 0 367 3
admitting 0 367 3
to 0 367 3
killing 0 367 3
an 0 367 3
innocent 1 367 3
man 0 367 3
and 0 367 3
having 0 367 3
her 0 367 3
initial 0 367 3
statement 0 367 3
contradicted 0 367 3
by 0 367 3
witness 0 367 3
testimony, 0 367 3
Guyger 0 367 3
has 0 367 3
been 0 367 3
treated 0 367 3
as 0 367 3
more 0 367 3
of 0 367 3
a 0 367 3
victim 0 367 3
than 0 367 3
a 0 367 3
killer. 0 367 3

In 0 367 4
fact, 0 367 4
Guyger’s 0 367 4
apartment 0 367 4
was 0 367 4
never 0 367 4
even 0 367 4
searched 0 367 4
for 0 367 4
evidence, 0 367 4
and 0 367 4
she 0 367 4
was 0 367 4
allowed 0 367 4
to 0 367 4
“vacate” 0 367 4
the 0 367 4
premises 0 367 4
without 0 367 4
any 0 367 4
type 0 367 4
of 0 367 4
search. 0 367 4

By 0 367 5
not 0 367 5
searching 0 367 5
her 0 367 5
apartment 0 367 5
immediately, 0 367 5
police 0 367 5
ruined 0 367 5
the 0 367 5

making 0 367 5
it 0 367 5
harder 0 367 5
to 0 367 5

her. 0 367 5

It 0 367 6
would 0 367 6
be 0 367 6

to 0 367 6

these 0 367 6
steps 0 367 6
were 0 367 6
taken 0 367 6

the 0 367 17

to 0 367 18
have 0 367 18
found 0 367 18
a 0 367 18
very 0 367 18

somehow 0 367 18

It 0 367 19
is 0 367 19
obvious 0 367 19
in 0 367 19
this 0 367 19

that 0 367 19
Guyger 0 367 19

it 0 367 21
possible 0 367 21

he 0 368 27
said 0 368 27
something 0 368 27
there, 0 368 27
which 0 368 27
is 0 368 27
more 0 368 27
than 0 368 27
I 0 368 27
can 0 368 27
say 0 368 27
for 0 368 27
his 0 368 27
response 0 368 27
earlier 0 368 27
in 0 368 27
September 0 368 27
when 0 368 27
Loomer 0 368 27
confronted 0 368 27
him 0 368 27
at 0 368 27
another 0 368 27
event 0 368 27
with 0 368 27
questions. 0 368 27

Failing 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
answer, 0 368 28
Ellison 0 368 28
tried 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
move 0 368 28
from 0 368 28
person 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
person, 0 368 28
allowing 0 368 28
his 0 368 28
minions 1 368 28
to 0 368 28
try 0 368 28
and 0 368 28
provide 0 368 28
cover 0 368 28
for 0 368 28
him, 0 368 28
similar 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
that 0 368 28
of 0 368 28
Maxine 0 368 28
Waters, 0 368 28
but 0 368 28
there 0 368 28
was 0 368 28
no 0 368 28
"member's 0 368 28
only" 0 368 28
elevator 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
flee 0 368 28
into. 0 368 28

Finally, 0 368 29
Ellison 0 368 29
fled 0 368 29
the 0 368 29
scene, 0 368 29
hounding 0 368 29
by 0 368 29
Loomer 0 368 29
and 0 368 29
others 0 368 29
questioning 0 368 29
him 0 368 29
about 0 368 29
the 0 368 29
abuse. 0 368 29

The 0 368 30
irony 0 368 30
is 0 368 30
of 0 368 30
Ellison's 0 368 30
campaign 0 368 30
calling 0 368 30
on 0 368 30
the 0 368 30
police 0 368 30
to 0 368 30
protect 0 368 30
him 0 368 30
from 0 368 30
a 0 368 30
woman, 0 368 30
armed 0 368 30
with 0 368 30
a 0 368 30
mic 0 368 30
and 0 368 30
camera 0 368 30
phone, 0 368 30
who 0 368 30
is 0 368 30
simply 0 368 30
asking 0 368 30
him 0 368 30
to 0 368 30
respond 0 368 30
to 0 368 30
the 0 368 30
accusations 0 368 30
and 0 368 30
police 0 368 30
report, 0 368 30
as 0 368 30
well 0 368 30
as 0 368 30
how 0 368 30

on 0 368 30
being 0 368 30
attorney 0 368 30
general 0 368 30
without 0 368 30
a 0 368 30

when 0 368 30
he 0 368 30
has 0 368 30
shown 0 368 30
his 0 368 30
support 0 368 30
for 0 368 30
those 0 368 30
that 0 368 30

Ellison 0 368 34
has 0 368 34
baldly 0 368 34
dissembled 0 368 34
about 0 368 34
this 0 368 34
history 0 368 34
since 0 368 34
2006. 0 368 34

In 0 368 35

’Tis 0 368 35
of 0 368 35
Thee 0 368 35
,for 0 368 35
example, 0 368 35
Ellison 0 368 35
simply 0 368 35
omitted 0 368 35
it 0 368 35
and 0 368 35
presented 0 368 35
himself 0 368 35
as 0 368 35
a 0 368 35
critic 0 368 35
of 0 368 35

the 0 368 35

This 0 368 36
past 0 368 36
June, 0 368 36
Ellison 0 368 36
told 0 368 36
Jake 0 368 36
Tapper 0 368 36
on 0 368 36
CNN, 0 368 36
“I 0 368 36
worked 0 368 36
on 0 368 36

I 0 368 36
was 0 368 36
proud 0 368 36
to 0 368 36
do 0 368 36
so. 0 368 36

That’s 0 368 37
it.” 0 368 37
But 0 368 37
that 0 368 37
wasn’t 0 368 37
it. 0 368 37

Ellison 0 368 38
first 0 368 38
sought 0 368 38
office 0 368 38
as 0 368 38
a 0 368 38
Democrat 0 368 38

Fortunately 0 368 40
for 0 368 40
him, 0 368 40
Ellison’s 0 368 40
5th 0 368 40
District 0 368 40
constituents 0 368 40
haven’t 0 368 40
much 0 368 40
cared 0 368 40
about 0 368 40
his 0 368 40
history 0 368 40
and 0 368 40
the 0 368 40
Minneapolis 0 368 40

has 0 368 40
almost 0 368 40
entirely 0 368 40

it 0 368 40
rest 0 368 40
exactly 0 368 40
where 0 368 40

wants 0 368 40
it. 0 368 40

But 0 368 41
seeking 0 368 41
the 0 368 41
top 0 368 41

and 0 368 41
running 0 368 41
for 0 368 41

be 0 368 41
a 0 368 41
more 0 368 41
daunting 0 368 41
challenge 0 368 41
because 0 368 41
Ellison 0 368 41
is 0 368 41
an 0 368 41
extraordinarily 1 368 41
poor 1 368 41
fit 1 368 41
for 0 368 41
the 0 368 41
job. 0 368 41

Among 0 368 42
the 0 368 42
troubling 0 368 42
threads 0 368 42
that 0 368 42
run 0 368 42
through 0 368 42
Ellison’s 0 368 42
career: 0 368 42
support 0 368 42
for 0 368 42
cop 1 368 42
killers. 1 368 42

In 0 368 43
September 0 368 43
1992 0 368 43
Minneapolis 0 368 43
police 0 368 43
officer 0 368 43
Jerry 0 368 43
Haaf 0 368 43
was 0 368 43
murdered 1 368 43
execution-style, 1 368 43
shot 0 368 43
in 0 368 43
the 0 368 43
back 0 368 43

he 0 368 43
took 0 368 43

at 0 368 43
a 0 368 43

in 0 368 43
south 0 368 43
Minneapolis. 0 368 43

Police 0 368 44
later 0 368 44
determined 0 368 44
that 0 368 44
Haaf’s 0 368 44
murder 0 368 44
was 0 368 44
a 0 368 44
gang 0 368 44

been 0 368 44
released 0 368 44
from 0 368 44

while 0 368 44
operating 0 368 44

called 0 368 44

The 0 368 45
four 0 368 45
Vice 0 368 45
Lords 0 368 45
members 0 368 45
who 0 368 45
murdered 0 368 45

met 0 368 45
and 0 368 45
planned 0 368 45
the 0 368 45
murder 0 368 45
at 0 368 45
Willis’s 0 368 45
house. 0 368 45

Despite 0 368 46
the 0 368 46
fact 0 368 46
that 0 368 46
two 0 368 46
witnesses 0 368 46
implicated 0 368 46
Willis 0 368 46
in 0 368 46
the 0 368 46
planning 0 368 46
he 0 368 46
was 0 368 46
never 0 368 46
charged 0 368 46
because 0 368 46
law 0 368 46
enforcement 0 368 46
authorities 0 368 46
said 0 368 46
they 0 368 46
lacked 0 368 46
sufficient 0 368 46
evidence 0 368 46
to 0 368 46
convict 0 368 46
him. 0 368 46

At 0 368 47
the 0 368 47
time, 0 368 47
Ellison 0 368 47
was 0 368 47

in 0 368 47

And 0 368 48
within 0 368 48
a 0 368 48
month 0 368 48
of 0 368 48
Haaf’s 0 368 48
murder, 0 368 48
Ellison 0 368 48

In 0 368 61

a 0 368 62

ominous 0 368 62
in 0 368 62
the 0 368 62

of 0 368 62
Haaf’s 0 368 62

Soliah/Olson 0 368 73
in 0 368 73
the 0 368 73

equally 0 368 73

Referring 0 368 75
to 0 368 75
the 0 368 75
days 0 368 75

had 0 368 75
spent 0 368 75
in 0 368 75
the 0 368 75

as 0 368 75
a 0 368 75
“black 1 368 75
gang 1 368 75

victim 0 368 75
of 0 368 75

He 0 368 76
described 0 368 76

one 0 368 76
of 0 368 76
those 0 368 76

called 0 368 76
for 0 368 76
her 0 368 76
release. 0 368 76

Ellison 0 368 77
to 0 368 77
the 0 368 77
contrary 0 368 77
notwithstanding, 0 368 77
Soliah/Olson 0 368 77
pleaded 0 368 77
guilty 0 368 77
to 0 368 77
the 0 368 77
crimes 0 368 77
charged 0 368 77
in 0 368 77

additional 0 368 77
murder 0 368 77
charge 0 368 77
in 0 368 77
Sacramento. 0 368 77

According 0 368 78
to 0 368 78
Ellison, 0 368 78
Soliah/Olson 0 368 78
was 0 368 78
a 0 368 78
social 0 368 78
justice 0 368 78
warrior 0 368 78
fighting 0 368 78
the 0 368 78
good 0 368 78
fight. 0 368 78

The 0 368 79
case 0 368 79
had 0 368 79
nothing 0 368 79
to 0 368 79
do 0 368 79
with 0 368 79
the 0 368 79
attempted 0 368 79
murder 0 368 79
of 0 368 79
police 0 368 79
officers; 0 368 79
that 0 368 79
was 0 368 79
but 0 368 79
a 0 368 79
pretext. 0 368 79

Seems 0 368 80
he 0 368 80
is 0 368 80
more 0 368 80
than 0 368 80
willing 0 368 80
to 0 368 80
use 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
police 0 368 80

him 0 368 80
from 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
press 0 368 80
who 0 368 80
will 0 368 80
confront 0 368 80
him 0 368 80
publicly 0 368 80
while 0 368 80
taking 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
side 0 368 80
of 0 368 80
their 0 368 80

Since 0 373 3
then, 0 373 3
there 0 373 3
have 0 373 3
been 0 373 3
numerous 0 373 3

However, 0 373 5
it 0 373 5
does 0 373 5
serve 0 373 5
as 0 373 5
a 0 373 5

to 0 373 20
this 0 373 20
Supreme 0 373 20

just 1 373 20

On 0 373 21
multiple 0 373 21
occasions, 0 373 21
Kavanaugh 0 373 21
has 0 373 21
been 0 373 21
the 0 373 21
lone 0 373 21
voice 0 373 21
when 0 373 21
it 0 373 21
comes 0 373 21
supporting 0 373 21
the 0 373 21
state’s 0 373 21
rights 0 373 21
to 0 373 21
warrantlessly 0 373 21
spy 0 373 21
on 0 373 21
its 0 373 21
citizens. 0 373 21

As 0 373 22
Reason 0 373 22
points 0 373 22
out, 0 373 22
in 0 373 22
2010 0 373 22
he 0 373 22
dissented 0 373 22
from 0 373 22
the 0 373 22
D.C. 0 373 22
Circuit’s 0 373 22
decision 0 373 22
not 0 373 22
to 0 373 22
rehear 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
case 0 373 22
in 0 373 22
which 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
three-judge 0 373 22
panel 0 373 22
had 0 373 22
ruled 0 373 22
that 0 373 22
police 0 373 22
violated 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
suspected 0 373 22
drug 0 373 22
dealer’s 0 373 22
Fourth 0 373 22
Amendment 0 373 22
rights 0 373 22
when 0 373 22
they 0 373 22
tracked 0 373 22
his 0 373 22
movements 0 373 22
for 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
month 0 373 22
by 0 373 22
attaching 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
GPS 0 373 22
device 0 373 22
to 0 373 22
his 0 373 22
car 0 373 22
without 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
warrant. 0 373 22

Kavanaugh 0 373 23
claimed 0 373 23
that 0 373 23
putting 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
GPS 0 373 23
tracking 0 373 23
device 0 373 23
on 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
person’s 0 373 23
car 0 373 23
without 0 373 23
first 0 373 23
obtaining 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
warrant 0 373 23
was 0 373 23
just 0 373 23
fine 0 373 23
because 0 373 23
it 0 373 23
didn’t 0 373 23
constitute 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
“search” 0 373 23
as 0 373 23
defined 0 373 23
by 0 373 23
the 0 373 23
Fourth 0 373 23
Amendment. 0 373 23

To 0 373 24
Kavanaugh, 0 373 24
bypassing 0 373 24
the 0 373 24
courts 0 373 24
and 0 373 24
tracking 0 373 24
an 0 373 24
individual 0 373 24
without 0 373 24
their 0 373 24
consent 0 373 24
is 0 373 24
“constitutional.” 0 373 24
In 0 373 24
this 0 373 24
line 0 373 24
of 0 373 24
thinking, 0 373 24
the 0 373 24
Fourth 0 373 24
Amendment 0 373 24
is 0 373 24
not 0 373 24
violated 0 373 24
even 0 373 24
if 0 373 24
police 0 373 24
trespass 0 373 24
on 0 373 24
someone’s 0 373 24
physical 0 373 24
property, 0 373 24
or 0 373 24
track 0 373 24
someone’s 0 373 24
cell 0 373 24
phone. 0 373 24

Luckily, 0 373 25
he 0 373 25
was 0 373 25
the 0 373 25
only 0 373 25
judge 0 373 25
on 0 373 25
the 0 373 25
panel 0 373 25
to 0 373 25
think 0 373 25
this. 0 373 25

In 0 373 26
June, 0 373 26
the 0 373 26
Supreme 0 373 26
Court 0 373 26
ruled 0 373 26
specifically 0 373 26
on 0 373 26
this 0 373 26
case 0 373 26
noting 0 373 26
that 0 373 26
collecting 0 373 26
such 0 373 26
information 0 373 26
actually 0 373 26
does 0 373 26
constitute 0 373 26
a 0 373 26
search 0 373 26
and 0 373 26
therefore 0 373 26
requires 0 373 26
a 0 373 26
warrant. 0 373 26

But 0 373 27
it 0 373 27
gets 0 373 27
worse. 0 373 27

In 0 373 28
2015, 0 373 28
Kavanaugh 0 373 28
issued 0 373 28
a 0 373 28
statement 0 373 28
strongly 0 373 28
defending 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
NSA’s 0 373 28
phone 0 373 28
metadata 0 373 28
collection 0 373 28
program, 0 373 28
arguing 0 373 28
that 0 373 28
it 0 373 28
is 0 373 28
“entirely 0 373 28
consistent 0 373 28
with 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
Fourth 0 373 28
Amendment.” 0 373 28
To 0 373 28
Kavanaugh, 0 373 28
sweeping 0 373 28
programs 0 373 28
that 0 373 28
collect 0 373 28
information 0 373 28
from 0 373 28
innocent 0 373 28
citizens’ 0 373 28
phones 0 373 28
are 0 373 28
not 0 373 28
in 0 373 28
conflict 0 373 28
with 0 373 28
having 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
right 0 373 28
to 0 373 28
be 0 373 28
free 0 373 28
from 0 373 28
unlawful 0 373 28
search 0 373 28
and 0 373 28
seizure. 0 373 28

Seriously. 1 373 29

According 0 373 30
to 0 373 30
Kavanaugh, 0 373 30
the 0 373 30
Fourth 0 373 30
Amendment 0 373 30
allows 0 373 30
for 0 373 30
searches 0 373 30
“without 0 373 30
individualized 0 373 30
suspicion” 0 373 30
when 0 373 30
the 0 373 30
government 0 373 30
demonstrates 0 373 30
a 0 373 30
“special 0 373 30
need” 0 373 30
that 0 373 30
“outweighs 0 373 30
the 0 373 30
intrusion 0 373 30
on 0 373 30
individual 0 373 30
liberty.” 0 373 30

Exactly 0 373 31
what 0 373 31
this 0 373 31
“special 0 373 31
need” 0 373 31
is 0 373 31
that 0 373 31
can 0 373 31
constitute 0 373 31
a 0 373 31
Gestapo 1 373 31
like 1 373 31
police 1 373 31
state 1 373 31
surveilling 1 373 31
its 0 373 31
own 0 373 31
citizens 0 373 31
is 0 373 31
a 0 373 31
moving 0 373 31
target 0 373 31
that 0 373 31
has 0 373 31
already 0 373 31
been 0 373 31
proven 0 373 31
to 0 373 31
be 0 373 31
abused 0 373 31
over 0 373 31
and 0 373 31
over 0 373 31
again. 0 373 31

“The 0 373 32
sacrifice 0 373 32
of 0 373 32
our 0 373 32
personal 0 373 32
liberty 0 373 32
for 0 373 32

is 0 373 32
and 0 373 32
will 0 373 32
forever 0 373 32
be 0 373 32
a 0 373 32
false 0 373 32
choice,” 0 373 32
Senator 0 373 32
Rand 0 373 32
Paul 0 373 32
said 0 373 32
of 0 373 32
Kavanaugh’s 0 373 32
views 0 373 32
on 0 373 32
the 0 373 32
disposable 0 373 32
nature 0 373 32
of 0 373 32
the 0 373 32
constitution. 0 373 32

Kavanaugh 0 373 33
“has 0 373 33
no 0 373 33
qualms 0 373 33
about 0 373 33
applying 0 373 33

law 0 373 33
to 0 373 33
the 0 373 33

and 0 373 33
he 0 373 33
has 0 373 33
endorsed 0 373 33
the 0 373 33
idea 0 373 33
of 0 373 33
a 0 373 33

to 0 373 33
the 0 373 33

trying 0 373 34
to 0 373 34

to 0 373 34
the 0 373 34

Representative 0 373 35

she 0 382 19

that 0 382 19

a 0 382 19

not 0 382 19

Trump 0 382 20
on 0 382 20

I 0 382 20

is 0 382 65
a 0 382 65
deep 0 382 65
part 0 382 65
of 0 382 65
the 0 382 65
Republican 0 382 65
establishment. 0 382 65

She 0 382 66
is 0 382 66
part 0 382 66
of 0 382 66
the 0 382 66
swamp, 0 382 66
part 0 382 66
of 0 382 66
the 0 382 66
willfully 1 382 66
ignorant 1 382 66
McMaster 0 382 66
crowd 0 382 66
that 0 382 66
clearly 0 382 66
opposed 0 382 66
Trump’s 0 382 66
agenda. 0 382 66

Back 0 382 67
in 0 382 67
2017, 0 382 67
she 0 382 67
resigned 0 382 67

failed 0 382 67
views 0 382 67
she 0 382 67
shared. 0 382 67

McMaster 0 382 68
subscribed 0 382 68
to 0 382 68
the 0 382 68
Obama 0 382 68
view 0 382 68
that 0 382 68
Islamic 0 382 68
terrorism 0 382 68
has 0 382 68
nothing 0 382 68
to 0 382 68
do 0 382 68
with 0 382 68
Islam, 0 382 68
despite 0 382 68
the 0 382 68
numerous 0 382 68
Islamic 0 382 68
texts 0 382 68
and 0 382 68
teachings 0 382 68
that 0 382 68
incite 0 382 68
Muslims 0 382 68
to 0 382 68
wage 0 382 68
war 0 382 68
against 0 382 68
unbelievers. 0 382 68

McMaster 0 382 69
went 0 382 69
so 0 382 69
far 0 382 69
as 0 382 69
to 0 382 69
claim 0 382 69
that 0 382 69
devout 0 382 69
jihadis 0 382 69
were 0 382 69
“irreligious.” 0 382 69

Again, 1 382 71
and 1 382 71
I 1 382 71
have 1 382 71
asked 1 382 71
this 1 382 71
before, 1 382 71
how 1 382 71
do 1 382 71
you 1 382 71
fight 1 382 71
the 1 382 71
Deep 1 382 71
State 1 382 71
by 1 382 71
putting 1 382 71
Deep 1 382 71
State 1 382 71
operatives 1 382 71
in 1 382 71
these 1 382 71
positions? 1 382 71

How 1 382 72
do 1 382 72
you 1 382 72
drain 1 382 72
the 1 382 72
swamp 1 382 72
by 1 382 72
adding 1 382 72
to 1 382 72
it? 1 382 72

The 0 382 73
answer 0 382 73
is 0 382 73
clear: 0 382 73
You 0 382 73
don't. 0 382 73

This 0 382 73

would 0 382 73

actually 0 382 73

be 0 382 73

the 0 382 73

perfect 0 382 73

time 0 382 73

for 0 382 73

Trump 0 382 73

not 0 382 73

to 0 382 73

exit 0 382 73

the 0 382 73

Congress 0 382 73

stop 0 382 73

funding 0 382 73

it 0 382 73

and 0 382 73

evict 0 382 73

the 0 382 73

UN 0 382 73

from 0 382 73

US 0 382 73

soil, 0 382 73

but 0 382 73

I'm 0 382 73

not 0 382 73

holding 0 382 73

my 0 382 73

Yesterday, 0 383 1
the 0 383 1
alternative 0 383 1

purge 0 383 1
was 0 383 1
boldly 1 383 1
advanced 0 383 1
in 0 383 1
a 0 383 1
coordinated 0 383 1

to 0 383 1

who 0 383 1
dissent 0 383 1
from 0 383 1

views. 0 383 1

It’s 0 383 2
just 0 383 2
one 0 383 2
more 0 383 2
step 0 383 2
toward 0 383 2
a 0 383 2

At 0 383 3
this 0 383 3

this 1 383 4
should 1 383 4

But 0 383 39
of 0 383 39
course, 0 383 39
since 0 383 39
they 0 383 39
too 0 383 39

that 0 383 41
many 0 383 41

shortly 0 383 41
thereafter 0 383 41
should 0 383 41
tell 0 383 41
you 0 383 41
that 0 383 41
this 1 383 41

a 1 383 41

effort 1 383 41
to 1 383 41

large 1 383 41
swaths 1 383 41
of 1 383 41
the 1 383 41

Of 0 383 42
course, 0 383 42
the 0 383 42
best 0 383 42
coverage 0 383 42
of 0 383 42
this 0 383 42
is 0 383 42
from…Russia. 0 383 42

Sputnik 0 383 43
News 0 383 43
contacted 0 383 43
many 0 383 43
of 0 383 43
the 0 383 43
alternative 0 383 43
journalists 0 383 43
who 0 383 43
were 0 383 43
purged 0 383 43
to 0 383 43
get 0 383 43
their 0 383 43
take 0 383 43
on 0 383 43
what 0 383 43
happened. 0 383 43

You 0 383 44
may 0 383 44
recall 0 383 44
that 0 383 44
basically 0 383 44
every 0 383 44
blogger 0 383 44
outside 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
establishment 0 383 44
media 0 383 44
was 0 383 44
accused 0 383 44
of 0 383 44
being 0 383 44
secretly 0 383 44
Russian 0 383 44
during 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
2016 0 383 44
election 0 383 44
by 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
Washington 0 383 44
Post, 0 383 44
so 0 383 44
perhaps 0 383 44
actual 0 383 44
Russians 0 383 44
have 0 383 44
a 0 383 44
vested 0 383 44
interest 0 383 44
in 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
truth 0 383 44
coming 0 383 44
out 0 383 44
on 0 383 44
this 0 383 44
topic. 0 383 44

My 0 383 45
friend 0 383 45
John 0 383 45
Vibes 0 383 45
is 0 383 45
an 1 383 45
amazing 1 383 45
person 1 383 45
who 0 383 45
contributes 0 383 45
to 0 383 45
The 0 383 45
Free 0 383 45
Thought 0 383 45
Project. 0 383 45

He 0 383 46
said: 0 383 46

This 0 383 47
signifies 0 383 47
a 0 383 47
re-consolidation 0 383 47
of 0 383 47
the 0 383 47
media. 0 383 47

Cable 0 383 48
news 0 383 48
media 0 383 48
controlled 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
narrative 0 383 48
for 0 383 48
most 0 383 48
of 0 383 48
modern 0 383 48
history, 0 383 48
but 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
internet 0 383 48
has 0 383 48
lowered 0 383 48
that 0 383 48
barrier 0 383 48
to 0 383 48
entry 0 383 48
and 0 383 48
allowed 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
average 0 383 48
person 0 383 48
to 0 383 48
become 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
media 0 383 48
themselves. 0 383 48

This 0 383 49
obviously 0 383 49
took 0 383 49
market 0 383 49
share 0 383 49
and 0 383 49
influence 0 383 49
away 0 383 49
from 0 383 49
the 0 383 49
traditional 0 383 49
media, 0 383 49
and 0 383 49
it 0 383 49
has 0 383 49
allowed 0 383 49
for 0 383 49
a 0 383 49
more 0 383 49
diverse 0 383 49
public 0 383 49
conversation. 0 383 49

Now 0 383 50
it 0 383 50
seems 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
platforms 0 383 50
that 0 383 50
have 0 383 50
monopolized 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
industry 0 383 50
are 0 383 50
favoring 0 383 50
mainstream 0 383 50
sources 0 383 50
and 0 383 50
silencing 0 383 50
alternative 0 383 50
voices. 0 383 50

So 0 383 51
now, 0 383 51
instead 0 383 51
of 0 383 51
allowing 0 383 51
more 0 383 51
people 0 383 51
to 0 383 51
have 0 383 51
a 0 383 51
voice, 0 383 51
these 0 383 51
platforms 0 383 51
are 0 383 51
creating 0 383 51
an 0 383 51
atmosphere 0 383 51
where 0 383 51
only 0 383 51
powerful 0 383 51
media 0 383 51
organizations 0 383 51
are 0 383 51
welcome, 0 383 51
just 0 383 51
as 0 383 51
we 0 383 51
had 0 383 51
on 0 383 51
cable 0 383 51
news. 0 383 51

People 0 383 52
think 0 383 52
that 0 383 52
we 0 383 52
are 0 383 52
just 0 383 52
providing 0 383 52
an 0 383 52
activist 0 383 52
spin 0 383 52
on 0 383 52
the 0 383 52
news, 0 383 52
but 0 383 52
they 0 383 52
don’t 0 383 52
see 0 383 52
the 0 383 52
families 0 383 52
struggling 0 383 52
to 0 383 52
have 0 383 52
their 0 383 52
voice 0 383 52
heard. 0 383 52

For 0 383 53
example, 0 383 53
when 0 383 53
someone 0 383 53
is 0 383 53
shot 0 383 53
by 0 383 53
police, 0 383 53
mainstream 0 383 53
media 0 383 53
sources 0 383 53
often 0 383 53
just 0 383 53
republish 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
press 0 383 53
release 0 383 53
from 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
police 0 383 53
department, 0 383 53
without 0 383 53
presenting 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
victim’s 0 383 53
side 0 383 53
of 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
story. 0 383 53

We 0 383 54
give 0 383 54
the 0 383 54
victims 0 383 54
and 0 383 54
their 0 383 54
families 0 383 54
a 0 383 54
voice, 0 383 54
which 0 383 54
is 0 383 54
essential 0 383 54
to 0 383 54
keep 0 383 54
power 0 383 54
in 0 383 54
check. 0 383 54

This 0 383 55
also 0 383 55
goes 0 383 55
for 0 383 55
bigger 0 383 55
issues 0 383 55
like 0 383 55
foreign 0 383 55
policy 0 383 55
as 0 383 55
well; 0 383 55
multiple 0 383 55
full-scale 0 383 55
invasions 0 383 55
of 0 383 55
Syria 0 383 55
have 0 383 55
been 0 383 55
prevented 0 383 55
because 0 383 55
of 0 383 55
information 0 383 55
that 0 383 55
the 0 383 55
alternative 0 383 55
media 0 383 55
made 0 383 55
viral. 0 383 55

Our 0 383 60
approach 0 383 60
generally 0 383 60
is 0 383 60
to 0 383 60
cover 0 383 60
stories 0 383 60
and 0 383 60
angles 0 383 60
that 0 383 60
corporate 0 383 60

underreport 0 383 60

misreport 0 383 60

to 0 383 60
amplify 0 383 60
activist 0 383 60
and 0 383 60
anti-war 0 383 60

All 0 383 61

is 0 383 61
professionally 0 383 61
fact-checked 0 383 61

edited. 0 383 61

I 0 383 62
got 0 383 62
into 0 383 62
this 0 383 62
line 0 383 62
of 0 383 62
work 0 383 62
because 0 383 62
I 0 383 62
felt 0 383 62
there 0 383 62
was 0 383 62
a 0 383 62
need 0 383 62
for 0 383 62
media 0 383 62
that 0 383 62
challenged 0 383 62
mainstream 0 383 62
assumptions 0 383 62
and 0 383 62
biases 0 383 62
in 0 383 62
politics. 0 383 62

I 0 383 63
wanted 0 383 63
to 0 383 63
shed 0 383 63
light 0 383 63
on 0 383 63
corruption 0 383 63
and 0 383 63
wrongdoing 0 383 63
against 0 383 63

harsh 1 383 63
truth 1 383 63
about 0 383 63
American 0 383 63

Over 0 383 64
the 0 383 64
last 0 383 64
28 0 383 64
days, 0 383 64
we 0 383 64

7,088,000 0 383 64
people 0 383 64

The 0 383 65
timing 0 383 65
of 0 383 65
this 0 383 65
purge 0 383 65
is 0 383 65
rather 0 383 65
dubious 1 383 65
in 0 383 65
my 0 383 65
view, 0 383 65
coming 0 383 65
shortly 0 383 65
before 0 383 65
the 0 383 65
midterm 0 383 65
elections. 0 383 65

This 1 383 66
could 1 383 66
be 1 383 66
an 1 383 66
attempt 1 383 66
by 1 383 66
Facebook 1 383 66
itself 1 383 66
to 1 383 66
affect 1 383 66
the 1 383 66
outcome 1 383 66
of 1 383 66
the 1 383 66
coming 1 383 66
elections. 1 383 66

The 0 383 67
Twitter 0 383 67
suspension 0 383 67
caught 0 383 67
me 0 383 67
by 0 383 67
surprise. 0 383 67

I 0 383 68
can 0 383 68
only 0 383 68
speculate 0 383 68
that 0 383 68
these 0 383 68
suspensions 0 383 68
were 0 383 68
a 1 383 68
coordinated 1 383 68
effort 1 383 68
to 1 383 68
stifle 1 383 68
our 1 383 68

Remember, 0 383 70
this 0 383 70
is 0 383 70
coordinated, 1 383 70
across 0 383 70
multiple 0 383 70

Remember 0 383 71
when 0 383 71
this 0 383 71
happened 0 383 71
to 0 383 71
Alex 0 383 71

Back 0 383 72
in 0 383 72
September, 0 383 72
an 0 383 72
assault 1 383 72
was 0 383 72

for 0 383 81
most 0 383 81

this 0 383 81

affects 0 383 112
everyone. 0 383 112

If 0 383 113
you’re 0 383 113
reading 0 383 113
this 0 383 113
and 0 383 113
you 0 383 113
shrug 0 383 113
because 0 383 113
you, 0 383 113
personally, 0 383 113
don’t 0 383 113
have 0 383 113
a 0 383 113
Twitter 0 383 113
or 0 383 113
Facebook 0 383 113
account, 0 383 113
you’re 0 383 113
missing 0 383 113
the 0 383 113
bigger 0 383 113
point. 0 383 113

Consider 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
fact 0 383 114
that 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
“population” 0 383 114
of 0 383 114
Facebook 0 383 114
is 0 383 114
bigger 0 383 114
than 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
populations 0 383 114
of 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
US, 0 383 114
China, 0 383 114
and 0 383 114
Brazil 0 383 114
combined. 0 383 114

That’s 0 383 115
how 0 383 115
many 0 383 115
people 0 383 115
will 0 383 115
now 0 383 115
only 0 383 115
receive 0 383 115
one 0 383 115
side 0 383 115
of 0 383 115
the 0 383 115
story 0 383 115
on 0 383 115
things 0 383 115
like 0 383 115

and 0 383 115
current 0 383 115
events. 0 383 115

People 0 383 116
will 0 383 116
believe 0 383 116
what 0 383 116
they’re 0 383 116
told 0 383 116
because 0 383 116
there 0 383 116
is 0 383 116
no 0 383 116
alternative 0 383 116

are 0 383 117
no 0 383 117

Social 0 383 122

a 0 383 122
massive 0 383 122

information 0 383 122

If 0 383 123
the 0 383 123
information 0 383 123
is 0 383 123
rigged 0 383 123
by 0 383 123
entities 0 383 123
that 0 383 123
support 0 383 123
socialism, 0 383 123

and 0 383 123
the 0 383 123
end 0 383 123
of 0 383 123
privacy, 0 383 123
we’re 1 383 123
doomed. 1 383 123

2.2 0 383 124
billion 0 383 124
active 0 383 124
users 0 383 124
will 0 383 124
be 0 383 124
bombarded 1 383 124
with 0 383 124
these 0 383 124

without 0 383 124
any 0 383 124

side 0 383 124
of 0 383 124
the 0 383 124

So 0 383 125
regardless 0 383 125
of 0 383 125
whether 0 383 125
you, 0 383 125

a 0 383 125
massive 1 383 125
degree. 0 383 125

It 0 383 126
will 0 383 126
grow 0 383 126
the 0 383 126
cognitive 0 383 126
dissonance 0 383 126
that 0 383 126
assures 0 383 126
people 0 383 126
of 0 383 126
things 0 383 126
like 0 383 126
“the 1 383 126
government 1 383 126
is 1 383 126
your 1 383 126
friend” 1 383 126
and 0 383 126
that 0 383 126
“you 1 383 126
don’t 1 383 126
need 1 383 126

yourself, 1 383 126
the 1 383 126

take 1 383 126

of 1 383 126
you.” 1 383 126

People 0 383 127
who 0 383 127
hate 0 383 127
freedom 0 383 127
will 0 383 127

of 0 383 127
2 0 383 127
billion 0 383 127
people. 0 383 127

That 1 383 128
should 1 383 128
scare 1 383 128
the 1 383 128
crap 1 383 128
out 1 383 128
of 1 383 128
you. 1 383 128

What 0 383 129
can 0 383 129
you 0 383 129
do 0 383 129
about 0 383 129
the 0 383 129
alternative 0 383 129
media 0 383 129
purge? 0 383 129

It’s 0 383 130
possible 0 383 130
but 0 383 130
unlikely 0 383 130
that 0 383 130
social 0 383 130
pressure 0 383 130
on 0 383 130
Facebook 0 383 130
and 0 383 130
Twitter 0 383 130

even 0 383 131
if 0 383 131
they 0 383 131
are 0 383 131
restored, 0 383 131
I 0 383 131
suspect 0 383 131
their 0 383 131

Instead, 0 384 17
these 0 384 17

how 0 384 18

are 0 384 33
the 0 384 33

themselves. 0 384 33

All 0 384 34
but 0 384 34
proving 0 384 34
the 0 384 34
case 0 384 34
that 0 384 34
this 0 384 34
was 0 384 34
a 0 384 34
coordinated 0 384 34
attack 0 384 34
by 0 384 34
the 0 384 34
tech 0 384 34
giant 0 384 34
community, 0 384 34
shortly 0 384 34
after 0 384 34
the 0 384 34
purge 0 384 34
on 0 384 34
Facebook, 0 384 34
Twitter 0 384 34
followed 0 384 34
suit, 0 384 34
wiping 0 384 34
out 0 384 34
our 0 384 34
profiles 0 384 34
on 0 384 34
there 0 384 34
as 0 384 34
well. 0 384 34

They 0 384 35
gave 0 384 35
absolutely 0 384 35
no 0 384 35
reason 0 384 35
for 0 384 35
the 0 384 35
suspension. 0 384 35

“This 0 384 36
signifies 0 384 36
a 0 384 36
re-consolidation 0 384 36
of 0 384 36
the 0 384 36
media. 0 384 36

Cable 0 384 37
news 0 384 37
media 0 384 37
controlled 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
narrative 0 384 37
for 0 384 37
most 0 384 37
of 0 384 37
modern 0 384 37
history, 0 384 37
but 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
internet 0 384 37
has 0 384 37
lowered 0 384 37
that 0 384 37
barrier 0 384 37
to 0 384 37
entry 0 384 37
and 0 384 37
allowed 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
average 0 384 37
person 0 384 37
to 0 384 37
become 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
media 0 384 37
themselves. 0 384 37

This 0 384 38
obviously 0 384 38
took 0 384 38
market 0 384 38
share 0 384 38
and 0 384 38
influence 0 384 38
away 0 384 38
from 0 384 38
the 0 384 38
traditional 0 384 38
media, 0 384 38
and 0 384 38
it 0 384 38
has 0 384 38
allowed 0 384 38
for 0 384 38
a 0 384 38
more 0 384 38
diverse 0 384 38
public 0 384 38
conversation. 0 384 38

Now 0 384 39
it 0 384 39
seems 0 384 39
the 0 384 39
platforms 0 384 39
that 0 384 39
have 0 384 39
monopolized 0 384 39
the 0 384 39
industry 0 384 39
are 0 384 39
favoring 0 384 39
mainstream 0 384 39
sources 0 384 39
and 0 384 39
silencing 0 384 39
alternative 0 384 39
voices. 0 384 39

So 0 384 40
now, 0 384 40
instead 0 384 40
of 0 384 40
allowing 0 384 40
more 0 384 40
people 0 384 40
to 0 384 40

the 0 387 9
Saudis 0 387 9
“understand 0 387 9

nature” 0 387 9
of 0 387 9

“timely” 0 387 9

Their 0 387 10
findings, 0 387 10
Pompeo 0 387 10
said, 0 387 10
“will 0 387 10
be 0 387 10
transparent 0 387 10

to 0 387 10
its 0 387 10
thoroughness.” 0 387 10

He 0 387 11
said 0 387 11
he 0 387 11
told 0 387 11
the 0 387 11
president 0 387 11
“that 0 387 11
we 0 387 11

that 0 387 11
so 0 387 11
that 0 387 11
we 0 387 11
too 0 387 11
have 0 387 11
a 0 387 11
complete 0 387 11
understanding 0 387 11

before 0 387 11
making 0 387 11
decisions 0 387 11
on 0 387 11
how 0 387 11
the 0 387 11
U.S. 0 387 11
should 0 387 11
respond. 0 387 11

Turkey 0 387 12
is 0 387 12
conducting 0 387 12
its 0 387 12
own 0 387 12
probe, 0 387 12
and 0 387 12
Pompeo 0 387 12
said 0 387 12
those 0 387 12
results 0 387 12
will 0 387 12
also 0 387 12
be 0 387 12
taken 0 387 12
into 0 387 12
consideration. 0 387 12

He 0 387 13
again 0 387 13
stressed 0 387 13
the 0 387 13
importance 0 387 13
of 0 387 13
Saudi 0 387 13
Arabia 0 387 13
as 0 387 13
a 0 387 13
strategic 0 387 13
ally, 0 387 13
in 0 387 13
a 0 387 13
relationship, 0 387 13
he 0 387 13
noted, 0 387 13
that 0 387 13
dates 0 387 13
back 0 387 13
more 0 387 13
than 0 387 13
80 0 387 13
years. 0 387 13

The 0 387 14
administration’s 0 387 14
reluctance 0 387 14
to 0 387 14
condemn 0 387 14
the 0 387 14
Saudi 0 387 14
government 0 387 14
has 0 387 14
fueled 0 387 14
criticism 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
Democrats 0 387 14
and 0 387 14
Republicans 0 387 14
in 0 387 14
Congress, 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
diplomats 0 387 14
and 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
even 0 387 14
some 0 387 14
corporations 0 387 14
that 0 387 14
long 0 387 14
have 0 387 14
profited 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
close 0 387 14
relations 0 387 14
with 0 387 14
the 0 387 14
Saudi 0 387 14
royal 0 387 14
family. 0 387 14

“We 0 387 15
just 0 387 15
are 0 387 15
going 0 387 15
to 0 387 15
allow 0 387 15

Pompeo 0 387 15
said. 0 387 15

“And 0 387 16
as 0 387 16
they 0 387 16

about 0 387 16

to 0 387 16
us, 0 387 16
the 1 387 16

will 0 387 16

There 0 412 20
is 0 412 20
a 0 412 20
lot 0 412 20
that’s 0 412 20
riding 1 412 20

If 0 412 21
the 0 412 21

the 0 412 21
Congress, 0 412 21

that 0 412 21
passing 0 412 21

is 0 412 21
one 0 412 21
of 0 412 21
her 0 412 21
top 0 412 21
priorities. 0 412 21

But 0 412 22
we 0 412 22
have 0 412 22
an 1 412 22
ace 1 412 22
up 1 412 22
our 1 412 22
proverbial 1 412 22
sleeve. 1 412 22

According 0 412 23
to 0 412 23
a 0 412 23
recent 0 412 23
study, 0 412 23
the 0 412 23
gun 0 412 23
issue 0 412 23
is 0 412 23
an 1 412 23
incredibly 1 412 23
powerful, 1 412 23
motivating 1 412 23
issue 1 412 23
in 1 412 23
politics. 1 412 23

The 0 412 24
study 0 412 24
reported 0 412 24
that 0 412 24
gun 0 412 24
owners 0 412 24
are 0 412 24
more 0 412 24
likely 0 412 24
to 0 412 24
show 0 412 24
up 0 412 24
to 0 412 24
vote 0 412 24
than 0 412 24
those 0 412 24
who 0 412 24
support 0 412 24
gun 0 412 24
control. 0 412 24

This 0 412 25
is 0 412 25
encouraging 0 412 25
news. 0 412 25

Having 0 412 26
said 0 412 26
that, 0 412 26
gun 0 412 26
owners 0 412 26
can’t 0 412 26
make 0 412 26
informed 0 412 26
choices 0 412 26
if 0 412 26
they 0 412 26
don’t 0 412 26

who 0 412 26
the 0 412 26

questions 0 85 2
about 0 85 2
just 1 85 2
how 1 85 2
evil 1 85 2

been 0 85 2
in 0 85 2
the 0 85 2

The 0 85 3
conversation 0 85 3
began 0 85 3
normally, 0 85 3
with 0 85 3
Clinton 0 85 3
hypocritically 1 85 3
toeing 1 85 3
the 0 85 3
progressive 0 85 3
line 0 85 3
of 0 85 3
identity 0 85 3
politics 0 85 3
by 0 85 3
explaining 0 85 3
how 0 85 3
each 0 85 3
of 0 85 3
the 0 85 3
groups 0 85 3
are 0 85 3
different 0 85 3
but 0 85 3
can 0 85 3
be 0 85 3
managed 0 85 3
by 0 85 3
the 0 85 3
same 0 85 3
liberal 0 85 3
movement: 0 85 3

“What’s 0 85 4
often 0 85 4
called 0 85 4
political 0 85 4
correctness 0 85 4
is 0 85 4
politeness,” 0 85 4
Clinton 0 85 4
said. 0 85 4

“It’s 0 85 5
not 0 85 5
being 0 85 5
rude 0 85 5
and 0 85 5
insulting 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
people. 0 85 5

It’s 0 85 6
respecting 0 85 6
the 0 85 6
diversity 0 85 6
that 0 85 6
we 0 85 6
have 0 85 6
in 0 85 6
our 0 85 6
society,” 0 85 6
she 0 85 6
said. 0 85 6

“The 0 85 7
Democratic 0 85 7
Party 0 85 7
is 0 85 7
a 0 85 7
much 0 85 7
more 0 85 7
diverse 0 85 7
political 0 85 7
party, 0 85 7
attracting 0 85 7
people 0 85 7
who 0 85 7
are 0 85 7
African-American, 0 85 7
Latino, 0 85 7
LGBT, 0 85 7
whatever 0 85 7
the 0 85 7
reason 0 85 7
why 0 85 7
people 0 85 7
feel 0 85 7
more 0 85 7
comfortable 0 85 7
where 0 85 7
they 0 85 7
are 0 85 7
taken 0 85 7
in, 0 85 7
where 0 85 7
they 0 85 7
are 0 85 7
included 0 85 7
as 0 85 7
part 0 85 7
of 0 85 7
a 0 85 7
political 0 85 7
movement 0 85 7
or 0 85 7
party.” 0 85 7
“And 0 85 7
I 0 85 7
don’t 0 85 7
think 0 85 7
it’s 0 85 7
politically 0 85 7
correct 0 85 7
to 0 85 7
say 0 85 7
we 0 85 7
value 0 85 7
that. 0 85 7

And 0 85 8
I 0 85 8
don’t 0 85 8
want 0 85 8
to 0 85 8
go 0 85 8
around 0 85 8
insulting 0 85 8
people. 0 85 8

I 0 85 9
don’t 0 85 9
want 0 85 9
to 0 85 9
paint 0 85 9
with 0 85 9
a 0 85 9
broad 0 85 9
brush 0 85 9
every 0 85 9
immigrant 0 85 9
is 0 85 9
this, 0 85 9
every 0 85 9
African-American 0 85 9
is 0 85 9
that, 0 85 9
every, 0 85 9
you 0 85 9
know, 0 85 9
other 0 85 9
person 0 85 9
with 0 85 9
different 0 85 9
religious 0 85 9
beliefs 0 85 9
or 0 85 9
whatever 0 85 9
– 0 85 9
that’s 1 85 9
childish.” 1 85 9

Childish, 1 85 10
indeed. 1 85 10

Insulting, 1 85 11
indeed. 1 85 11

Just 0 85 12
30 0 85 12
seconds 0 85 12
later, 0 85 12
as 0 85 12
Swisher 0 85 12
asked: 0 85 12

“what 0 85 13
do 0 85 13
you 0 85 13
think 0 85 13
of 0 85 13
Cory 0 85 13
Booker… 0 85 13
saying 0 85 13
‘kick 1 85 13
them 1 85 13
in 1 85 13
the 1 85 13
shins,’ 1 85 13
essentially…” 0 85 13
incorrectly 0 85 13
recalling 0 85 13
Eric 0 85 13
Holder’s 0 85 13
recent 0 85 13
comments. 0 85 13

Which 0 85 14
Clinton 0 85 14
quickly 0 85 14
corrected: 0 85 14

“Well 0 85 15
that 0 85 15
was 0 85 15
Eric 0 85 15
Holder…” 0 85 15

Adding, 0 85 16
rather 1 85 16
extraordinarily, 1 85 16

“Yeah, 0 85 17
I 0 85 17
know 0 85 17
they 0 85 17
all 0 85 17
look 0 85 17
alike,” 0 85 17
Clinton 0 85 17
joked, 0 85 17
triggering 0 85 17
howls 0 85 17
of 0 85 17
laughter 0 85 17
from 0 85 17
the 0 85 17
apparently 0 85 17
mind-numbed 0 85 17
audience. 0 85 17

Sorry 1 85 18
Hillary, 1 85 18
we 1 85 18
don’t 1 85 18
think 1 85 18
they 1 85 18
look 1 85 18
anything 1 85 18
alike. 1 85 18

Or 1 85 19
did 1 85 19
you 1 85 19
mean 1 85 19
all 1 85 19
black 1 85 19
people? 1 85 19

Finally, 0 85 20
we 0 85 20
have 0 85 20

Chelsey 0 429 45

She 1 429 46
ignored 1 429 46
a 1 429 46

mixed 1 429 46
invalid 1 429 46
provisional 1 429 46

destroyed 1 429 46

but 1 429 46
don't 1 429 46
worry, 1 429 46
a 1 429 46
Democrat 1 429 46
attorney 1 429 46
says 1 429 46
that 1 429 46
doing 1 429 46

nothing 1 429 46

perhaps 1 429 47
it's 1 429 47

to 1 429 47
quit 1 429 47
talking 1 429 47
about 1 429 47
it 1 429 47

actually 1 429 47
arrest 1 429 47
this 1 429 47

the 1 439 38

As 0 439 39
they 0 439 39
should. 0 439 39

It's 0 439 40
frivolous, 1 439 40
but 0 439 40
because 0 439 40
they 0 439 40
are 0 439 40

it's 0 439 40
not 0 439 40

it's 0 439 40

two 0 439 45
questions 0 439 45

of 0 439 45
which 0 439 45
the 0 439 45
President 0 439 45
answered 0 439 45

he 0 439 45
physically 0 439 45

that 0 439 45

might 0 439 45
ask 0 439 45

over 0 117 1
that 0 117 1

Now, 0 117 2
a 0 117 2

there 0 117 2

the 0 117 3

On 0 117 6
Thursday 0 117 6
evening, 0 117 6
Representative 0 117 6
Scott 0 117 6
Perry 0 117 6
(R-PA) 0 117 6
appeared 0 117 6
on 0 117 6
Tucker 0 117 6
Carlson 0 117 6
tonight 0 117 6
and 0 117 6
said 0 117 6
that 0 117 6
he 0 117 6
has 0 117 6
evidence 0 117 6
that 0 117 6
the 0 117 6

may 0 117 6
be 0 117 6
telling 0 117 6

that 0 117 6
they 0 117 6

actually 0 117 6
have 0 117 6
been 0 117 6
involved 0 117 6
in 0 117 6
the 0 117 6
deadly 0 117 6
attack. 0 117 6

Perry 0 117 7
brought 0 117 7
up 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
fact 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
we 0 117 7
can't 0 117 7
seem 0 117 7
to 0 117 7
get 0 117 7
information 0 117 7
in 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
case 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
public 0 117 7
needs 0 117 7
to 0 117 7
be 0 117 7
made 0 117 7
aware 0 117 7
of, 0 117 7
something 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
was 0 117 7
brought 0 117 7
up 0 117 7
in 0 117 7
a 0 117 7
district 0 117 7
courtroom 0 117 7
earlier 0 117 7
this 0 117 7
week. 0 117 7

Additionally, 0 117 8
the 0 117 8
family 0 117 8
of 0 117 8
Stephen 0 117 8
Paddock 0 117 8
just 0 117 8
received 0 117 8
his 0 117 8
cremated 0 117 8
remains 0 117 8
on 0 117 8
Thursday 0 117 8
and 0 117 8
his 0 117 8
brother 0 117 8
said 0 117 8
that 0 117 8
the 0 117 8
family 0 117 8
has 0 117 8
yet 0 117 8
to 0 117 8
receive 0 117 8
an 0 117 8
autopsy 0 117 8
report. 0 117 8

Why 0 117 9
is 0 117 9
that? 0 117 9

Everyone 0 117 10
who 0 117 10
was 0 117 10
killed 0 117 10
that 0 117 10
night 0 117 10
had 0 117 10
autopsies 0 117 10
and 0 117 10
those 0 117 10
have 0 117 10
been 0 117 10
released. 0 117 10

We're 0 117 11
told 0 117 11
Paddock 0 117 11
shot 0 117 11
himself 0 117 11
in 0 117 11
the 0 117 11
head, 0 117 11
right? 0 117 11

Why 1 117 12
would 1 117 12
the 1 117 12
autopsy 1 117 12
report 1 117 12
be 1 117 12
something 1 117 12
that 1 117 12
needs 1 117 12
to 1 117 12
be 1 117 12
withheld 1 117 12
from 1 117 12
the 1 117 12
public 1 117 12
or 1 117 12
his 1 117 12
family? 1 117 12

"Recently 0 117 13
I’ve 0 117 13
been 0 117 13
made 0 117 13
aware 0 117 13
of 0 117 13
what 0 117 13
I 0 117 13
believe 0 117 13
to 0 117 13
be 0 117 13
credible 1 117 13

regarding 0 117 13

"Twice 0 117 14
before 0 117 14

ISIS 0 117 14
warned 0 117 14
the 0 117 14
United 0 117 14
States 0 117 14
they 0 117 14
would 0 117 14
attack 0 117 14

he 0 117 14
added. 0 117 14

"In 0 117 15
June 0 117 15
and 0 117 15
August." 0 117 15

"And 0 117 16
then 0 117 16
after 0 117 16
the 0 117 16
attack 0 117 16
claimed 0 117 16
responsibility 0 117 16
four 0 117 16
times," 0 117 16
Perry 0 117 16
continued. 0 117 16

"Something’s 1 117 17
not 1 117 17
adding 1 117 17
up." 1 117 17

"I’m 0 117 18
just 0 117 18
telling 0 117 18
you 0 117 18
I 0 117 18
have 0 117 18

of 0 117 18
a 0 117 18
possible 0 117 18
terrorist 0 117 18
nexus," 0 117 18
Perry 0 117 18
said. 0 117 18

The 0 117 19
investigation 0 117 19
has 0 117 19
been 0 117 19
conducted 0 117 19
by 0 117 19
local 0 117 19
and 0 117 19
state 0 117 19
police, 0 117 19
not 0 117 19
the 0 117 19
feds, 0 117 19
and 0 117 19
yet, 0 117 19
they 0 117 19
continue 0 117 19
to 0 117 19
claim 0 117 19
there 0 117 19
is 0 117 19
not 0 117 19
Islamic 0 117 19
terrorist 0 117 19
involvement. 0 117 19

Yet, 0 117 20
though 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
claim 0 117 20
that 0 117 20
Paddock 0 117 20
was 0 117 20
a 0 117 20
lone 0 117 20
gunman, 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
continue 0 117 20
to 0 117 20
withhold 0 117 20
video 0 117 20
of 0 117 20
him 0 117 20
in 0 117 20
Mandalay 0 117 20
Bay 0 117 20
because 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
are 0 117 20
still 0 117 20
investigating 0 117 20
other 0 117 20
suspects 0 117 20
to 0 117 20
charge 0 117 20
in 0 117 20
the 0 117 20
shooting. 0 117 20

And 0 117 21
no 0 117 21
one 0 117 21
seems 0 117 21
to 0 117 21
know 0 117 21

either. 0 117 21

None 0 117 22
of 0 117 22
this 0 117 22
is 0 117 22
really 0 117 22
that 0 117 22
surprising. 0 117 22

If 0 117 23
you 0 117 23
recall, 0 117 23
we 0 117 23
reported 0 117 23
on 0 117 23
Islamic 0 117 23
terrorists 0 117 23
settling 0 117 23
into 0 117 23
Mexico 0 117 23
and 0 117 23
crossing 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
border 0 117 23
some 0 117 23
years 0 117 23
back 0 117 23
and 0 117 23
that 0 117 23
came 0 117 23
out 0 117 23
as 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
infamous 0 117 23
"Gang 0 117 23
of 0 117 23
Eight" 0 117 23

working 0 117 23
on 0 117 23
an 0 117 23

Congress 0 117 23
authorized 0 117 23
just 0 117 23
seven 0 117 23
years 0 117 23
ago, 0 117 23
with 0 117 23
a 0 117 23
majority 0 117 23
of 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
Senate 0 117 23
saying 0 117 23
they 0 117 23
didn't 0 117 23
want 0 117 23
to 0 117 23
delay 0 117 23
granting 0 117 23
illegal 0 117 23

while 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
fence 0 117 23
was 0 117 23
being 0 117 23
built. 0 117 23

Three 0 117 24
years 0 117 24
prior 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
report, 0 117 24
there 0 117 24
was 0 117 24
a 0 117 24
video 0 117 24
report 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
seems 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
have 0 117 24
provided 0 117 24
a 0 117 24
bit 0 117 24
of 0 117 24
evidence 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
the 0 117 24
claim 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
Islamists 0 117 24
were 0 117 24
crossing 0 117 24
our 0 117 24
southern 0 117 24
border. 0 117 24

And 0 117 25
even 0 117 25
though 0 117 25
Islamic 0 117 25
jihadis 0 117 25
have 0 117 25
been 0 117 25
apprehended 0 117 25
on 0 117 25
our 0 117 25
border 0 117 25
in 0 117 25
2014, 0 117 25
the 0 117 25
Homeland 0 117 25
Security 0 117 25
waved 0 117 25
their 0 117 25
hand 0 117 25
and 0 117 25
said, 0 117 25
"There's 1 117 25
no 1 117 25
threat." 1 117 25

In 0 117 26
fact, 0 117 26
DHS 0 117 26
had 0 117 26
denied 0 117 26
Muslim 0 117 26
terrorists 0 117 26
were 0 117 26
crossing 0 117 26
the 0 117 26
border, 0 117 26
but 0 117 26
a 0 117 26
local 0 117 26
investigator 0 117 26
produced 0 117 26
evidence 0 117 26
to 0 117 26
the 0 117 26
contrary. 0 117 26

Reports 0 117 27
indicated 0 117 27
that 0 117 27
some 0 117 27
jihadis 0 117 27
were 0 117 27
paying 0 117 27
as 0 117 27
much 0 117 27
as 0 117 27
$50,000 0 117 27
to 0 117 27
get 0 117 27
across 0 117 27
the 0 117 27
border. 0 117 27

This 0 117 28
has 0 117 28
been 0 117 28
documented 0 117 28
for 0 117 28
several 0 117 28
years 0 117 28
now. 0 117 28

It's 0 117 29
not 0 117 29
surprising. 0 117 29

What 1 117 29

is 1 117 29

surprising 1 117 29

is 1 117 29

the 1 117 29

level 1 117 29

the 0 125 1

what 0 125 1
one 0 125 1

described 0 125 1
as 0 125 1

“snippy 1 125 1
tone”: 1 125 1
“The 0 125 1

then 0 125 1
I 0 125 1
will 0 125 1
talk. 0 125 1

There 0 125 2
is 0 125 2

a 0 125 2
single 0 125 2
piece 0 125 2
of 0 125 2
evidence 0 125 2
against 0 125 2
him. 0 125 2

It 0 125 3
is 0 125 3
all 0 125 3
calumny. 0 125 3

Is 0 125 4
that 0 125 4
clear?” 0 125 4

This 0 125 5
month 0 125 5
has 0 125 5
been 0 125 5
quite 0 125 5
a 0 125 5
spectacle, 0 125 5
even 0 125 5
for 0 125 5
this 0 125 5

an 0 125 5

unending 1 125 5

embarrassments, 1 125 5
with 0 125 5

But 0 125 6
among 0 125 6
secular 0 125 6

the 0 125 6
sex 0 125 6

the 0 125 6

his 0 125 6
amazing 0 125 6
accusation 0 125 6
earlier 0 125 6
this 0 125 6
month 0 125 6

Sorry 0 125 32
Austen, 0 125 32
we 0 125 32
didn’t 0 125 32
think 0 125 32
of 0 125 32
it 0 125 32
as 0 125 32
we 0 125 32

Although 0 125 33
the 0 125 33
issue 0 125 33
came 0 125 33
to 0 125 33
the 0 125 33

of 0 125 33
a 0 125 33

the 0 125 33
outcry 0 125 33
has 0 125 33
been 0 125 33
ongoing 0 125 33
since 0 125 33

2015. 0 125 33

Barros 0 125 34
was 0 125 34
a 0 125 34
student 0 125 34

of 0 125 34
the 0 125 34

forces. 0 125 34

Barros 0 125 35
claimed 0 125 35
in 0 125 35
court 0 125 35
that 0 125 35
the 0 125 35
first 0 125 35

of 0 125 35

This 0 125 36
is 0 125 36
refuted 0 125 36
by 0 125 36
Karadima’s 0 125 36
victims 0 125 36
– 0 125 36
deemed 0 125 36

that 0 125 36

Last 0 125 37
Thursday, 0 125 37
however, 0 125 37
was 0 125 37
not 0 125 37
the 0 125 37
first 0 125 37
time 0 125 37
Francis, 0 125 37
confronted 0 125 37
unexpectedly 0 125 37
in 0 125 37
public 0 125 37
over 0 125 37
the 0 125 37
Barros 0 125 37
question, 0 125 37
has 0 125 37
responded 0 125 37
testily 0 125 37
and 0 125 37
with 0 125 37
insults. 0 125 37

In 0 125 38
2015 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
Italian 0 125 38
newspaper 0 125 38
Il 0 125 38

published 0 125 38
a 0 125 38
video 0 125 38
of 0 125 38
him 0 125 38
scolding 0 125 38
two 0 125 38
women 0 125 38
who 0 125 38
spoke 0 125 38
with 0 125 38
him 0 125 38
in 0 125 38
St. 0 125 38
Peter’s 0 125 38
Piazza, 0 125 38
asking 0 125 38
that 0 125 38
he 0 125 38
reconsider 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
appointment, 0 125 38
citing 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
“suffering” 0 125 38
of 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
Church 0 125 38
in 0 125 38
Chile 0 125 38
over 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
issue. 0 125 38

The 0 125 39
pope 0 125 39
told 0 125 39
the 0 125 39
women, 0 125 39
“The 0 125 39
Church 0 125 39
has 0 125 39
lost 0 125 39
its 0 125 39
freedom, 0 125 39
letting 0 125 39
its 0 125 39
head 0 125 39
fill 0 125 39
with 0 125 39
politicians 0 125 39
and 0 125 39
accusing 0 125 39
a 0 125 39
bishop 0 125 39
without 0 125 39
having 0 125 39
any 0 125 39
proof, 0 125 39
after 0 125 39
twenty 0 125 39
years 0 125 39
of 0 125 39
service, 0 125 39
so 0 125 39
think 1 125 39
with 1 125 39
your 1 125 39
head.” 1 125 39
He 0 125 39
warned 0 125 39
them 0 125 39
not 0 125 39
to 0 125 39
allow 0 125 39
themselves 0 125 39
to 0 125 39
be 0 125 39
led 0 125 39
by 0 125 39
“leftists 1 125 39
who 1 125 39
have 1 125 39
set 1 125 39
up 1 125 39
this 1 125 39
thing.” 1 125 39

“The 0 125 40
only 0 125 40
charge 0 125 40
against 0 125 40
this 0 125 40
bishop 0 125 40
has 0 125 40
been 0 125 40
discredited 0 125 40
by 0 125 40
the 0 125 40
Court 0 125 40
of 0 125 40
Justice, 0 125 40
so 0 125 40
please 0 125 40
do 0 125 40
not 0 125 40
lose 0 125 40
your 0 125 40
serenity, 0 125 40
you 0 125 40
suffer, 0 125 40
but 0 125 40
because 0 125 40
you 1 125 40
are 1 125 40
foolish...I 1 125 40
am 0 125 40
the 0 125 40
first 0 125 40
to 0 125 40
judge 0 125 40
and 0 125 40
punish 0 125 40
those 0 125 40
accused 0 125 40
of 0 125 40
similar 0 125 40
crimes, 0 125 40
but 0 125 40
in 0 125 40
this 0 125 40
case 0 125 40
there 0 125 40
is 0 125 40
not 0 125 40
even 0 125 40
a 0 125 40
proof.” 0 125 40

The 0 125 41
insults 0 125 41
were 0 125 41
not 0 125 41
forgotten. 0 125 41

Among 0 125 42
the 0 125 42
signs 0 125 42
held 0 125 42
by 0 125 42
protesters 0 125 42
in 0 125 42
Chile 0 125 42
last 0 125 42
week 0 125 42
were 0 125 42
those 0 125 42
reading, 0 125 42
“Ni 0 125 42
zurdos, 0 125 42
ni 0 125 42
tontos,” 0 125 42
(Neither 1 125 42
lefties 1 125 42
nor 1 125 42
stupid). 1 125 42

The 0 125 43
jab 0 125 43
certainly 0 125 43
wasn’t 0 125 43
lost 0 125 43
on 0 125 43
Francis, 0 125 43
since 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
signs 0 125 43
were 0 125 43
being 0 125 43
held 0 125 43
by 0 125 43
protesters 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
full 0 125 43
length 0 125 43
of 0 125 43
his 0 125 43
auto 0 125 43
route 0 125 43
to 0 125 43
Santiago 0 125 43
from 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
airport. 0 125 43

One 0 125 44
of 0 125 44
the 0 125 44
protesters 0 125 44
told 0 125 44
the 0 125 44
BBC, 0 125 44
“He 0 125 44
doesn’t 0 125 44
even 0 125 44
know 0 125 44
us, 0 125 44
so 0 125 44
how 0 125 44
can 0 125 44
he 0 125 44
accuse 0 125 44
us 0 125 44
of 0 125 44
being 0 125 44
such 0 125 44
things? 0 125 44

He 0 125 45
thinks 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
politically 0 125 45
motivated 0 125 45
even 0 125 45
though 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
come 0 125 45
from 0 125 45
different 0 125 45
parishes 0 125 45
in 0 125 45
Osorno 0 125 45
and 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
doing 0 125 45
this 0 125 45
because 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
against 0 125 45
priests 0 125 45
being 0 125 45
allowed 0 125 45
to 0 125 45
abuse 0 125 45
children.” 0 125 45

Apparently 0 125 46
His 0 125 46
Holiness 0 125 46
was 0 125 46
informed 0 125 46
that 0 125 46
the 0 125 46
“calumny” 1 125 46
comment 1 125 46
had 0 125 46
caused 0 125 46
some 0 125 46
blow-back 0 125 46
because 0 125 46
a 0 125 46
couple 0 125 46
of 0 125 46
days 0 125 46
later 0 125 46
we 0 125 46
got 0 125 46
something 0 125 46
touted 0 125 46
– 0 125 46
though 0 125 46
somewhat 0 125 46
skeptically 0 125 46
– 0 125 46
as 0 125 46
a 0 125 46
“contrite” 0 125 46
papal 0 125 46
apology. 0 125 46

This 0 125 47
also 0 125 47
followed 0 125 47
an 0 125 47
astonishing 0 125 47
public 0 125 47
rebuke 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
the 0 125 47
pope 0 125 47
by 0 125 47
Sean 0 125 47
Cardinal 0 125 47
O’Malley 0 125 47
– 0 125 47
a 0 125 47
member 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
the 0 125 47
C9 0 125 47

the 0 125 47

of 0 125 47
the 0 125 47
pope’s 0 125 47
sex 0 125 47
abuse 0 125 47
commission 0 125 47
– 0 125 47
who 0 125 47
said, 0 125 47
“It 0 125 47
is 0 125 47
understandable 0 125 47
that 0 125 47
Pope 0 125 47
Francis’ 0 125 47
statements 0 125 47
yesterday 0 125 47
in 0 125 47
Santiago, 0 125 47
Chile 0 125 47
were 0 125 47
a 0 125 47
source 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
great 0 125 47
pain 0 125 47
for 0 125 47
survivors 0 125 47
of 0 125 47

by 0 125 47
clergy 0 125 47

any 0 125 47
other 0 125 47
perpetrator.” 0 125 47

“Pope 0 125 48
Francis 0 125 48
fully 0 125 48
recognizes 0 125 48
the 1 125 48
egregious 1 125 48
failures 1 125 48
of 0 125 48
the 0 125 48
Church 0 125 48
and 0 125 48
its 0 125 48
clergy 0 125 48
who 0 125 48
abused 0 125 48
children 0 125 48
and 0 125 48
the 0 125 48
devastating 1 125 48
impact 1 125 48
those 0 125 48
crimes 0 125 48
have 0 125 48
had 0 125 48
on 0 125 48
survivors 0 125 48

their 0 125 48
loved 0 125 48

O’Malley 0 125 48
said. 0 125 48

Of 0 125 49
course, 0 125 49
Francis 0 125 49
being 0 125 49
Francis 0 125 49
the 0 125 49
apology 0 125 49
was 0 125 49
banked 0 125 49
around 0 125 49
with 0 125 49
assertions 0 125 49
of 0 125 49
how 0 125 49
right 0 125 49
he 0 125 49
was. 0 125 49

“I 0 125 50
have 0 125 50
to 0 125 50
ask 0 125 50
forgiveness 0 125 50
because 0 125 50
the 0 125 50
word 0 125 50
‘proof’ 0 125 50
wounded,” 0 125 50
he 0 125 50
said. 0 125 50

“It 0 125 51
wounded 0 125 51
many 0 125 51
people 0 125 51
who 0 125 51
were 0 125 51
abused…I 0 125 51
ask 0 125 51
them 0 125 51
for 0 125 51
forgiveness 0 125 51
because 0 125 51
I 0 125 51
wounded 0 125 51
them 0 125 51
without 0 125 51
realizing 0 125 51
it, 0 125 51
but 0 125 51
it 0 125 51
was 0 125 51
an 0 125 51
unintended 0 125 51
wound. 0 125 51

And 0 125 52
this 1 125 52
horrified 1 125 52
me 1 125 52
a 1 125 52
lot, 1 125 52
because 0 125 52
I 0 125 52
had 0 125 52
received 0 125 52
them.” 0 125 52

“And 0 125 53
I 0 125 53
know 0 125 53
how 0 125 53
much 0 125 53
they 0 125 53
suffer, 0 125 53
to 0 125 53
feel 0 125 53
that 0 125 53
the 0 125 53
Pope 0 125 53

in 0 125 53
their 0 125 53
face 0 125 53
‘bring 0 125 53
me 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
letter, 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
proof.’ 0 125 53
It’s 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
slap. 0 125 53

And 0 125 54
I 0 125 54
agree 0 125 54
that 0 125 54
my 0 125 54
expression 0 125 54
was 0 125 54
not 0 125 54
apt, 0 125 54

I 0 125 54
didn’t 0 125 54
think.” 0 125 54

He 0 125 55
doubled 0 125 55
down, 0 125 55
saying, 0 125 55

It 0 125 58

that 0 125 69

six 0 125 69

Who 0 125 70
is 0 125 70
Barros? 0 125 70

Some 0 125 71
may 0 125 71
remember 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
video 0 125 71
that 0 125 71
made 0 125 71
the 0 125 71
internet 0 125 71
rounds 0 125 71
of 0 125 71
an 0 125 71
uproar 0 125 71
in 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
Chilean 0 125 71
cathedral 0 125 71
at 0 125 71
the 0 125 71
installation 0 125 71
ceremony 0 125 71
of 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
bishop. 0 125 71

At 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
time 0 125 72
it 0 125 72
didn’t 0 125 72
draw 0 125 72
much 0 125 72
attention 0 125 72
from 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
English 0 125 72
language 0 125 72
press 0 125 72
– 0 125 72
mostly 0 125 72
at 0 125 72
that 0 125 72
time 0 125 72
distracted 0 125 72
by 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
ongoing 0 125 72
battle 0 125 72
of 0 125 72

notorious 0 125 72

the 0 125 72
oncoming 0 125 72

But 0 125 73
despite 0 125 73
the 0 125 73
pope’s 0 125 73
claim, 0 125 73
the 0 125 73
charges 0 125 73
against 0 125 73
Barros 0 125 73
are 0 125 73
serious 0 125 73
and 0 125 73
have 0 125 73
been 0 125 73
deemed 0 125 73
credible 0 125 73
by 0 125 73
a 0 125 73
judge. 0 125 73

He 0 125 74
is 0 125 74
accused 0 125 74
of 0 125 74
having 0 125 74
covered 0 125 74
up 0 125 74
sexual 0 125 74
abuse, 0 125 74
including 0 125 74
destroying 0 125 74
evidence, 0 125 74
committed 0 125 74
by 0 125 74
Karadima 0 125 74
in 0 125 74
the 0 125 74
‘80s 0 125 74
and 0 125 74
‘90s. 0 125 74

In 0 125 75
fact 0 125 75
– 0 125 75
and 0 125 75
this 0 125 75
point 0 125 75
has 0 125 75
tended 0 125 75
to 0 125 75
get 0 125 75
glossed 0 125 75
over 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
press 0 125 75
– 0 125 75
Barros 0 125 75
is 0 125 75
accused 0 125 75
by 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
victims 0 125 75
of 0 125 75
having 0 125 75
been 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
room, 0 125 75
watching 0 125 75
at 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
time, 0 125 75

of 0 125 75
engaging 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
sexual 0 125 75
activity 0 125 75
with 0 125 75
Karadima. 0 125 75

This 0 125 76
is 0 125 76
not, 0 125 76
therefore, 0 125 76
merely 0 125 76
a 0 125 76
matter 0 125 76
of 0 125 76
a 0 125 76
bishop 0 125 76
or 0 125 76
colleague 0 125 76
discovering 0 125 76
the 0 125 76
abuse 0 125 76
after 0 125 76
the 0 125 76
fact, 0 125 76
but 0 125 76
of 0 125 76
being 0 125 76
a 1 125 76

that 0 125 80

The 0 125 108
pope 0 125 108

this 0 125 108

a 0 125 124
cloud 0 125 124

he 0 125 124

undeniably 0 125 125
that 0 125 125
Danneels 0 125 125
had 0 125 125
told 0 125 125

The 0 125 126
cardinal 0 125 126
even 0 125 126
went 0 125 126
so 0 125 126
far 0 125 126
as 0 125 126
to 0 125 126
suggest 0 125 126
that 0 125 126

In 0 125 128
the 0 125 128
book, 0 125 128
Colonna 0 125 128
asks 0 125 128
the 0 125 128

Crucially, 0 125 130
it 0 125 130
was 0 125 130

Despite 0 125 135
his 0 125 135

that 0 125 135

it 0 125 135
was 0 125 135
in 0 125 135
fact 0 125 135
Francis 0 125 135

of 0 125 135
the 0 125 135
now-equally 0 125 135
notorious 0 125 135
Cardinal 0 125 135
Coccopalmerio. 0 125 135

Inzoli 0 125 136
was 0 125 136
found 0 125 136
guilty 0 125 136
in 0 125 136
2012 0 125 136
by 0 125 136
an 0 125 136
ecclesiastical 0 125 136
court 0 125 136
of 0 125 136
abusing 0 125 136
boys 0 125 136
as 0 125 136
young 0 125 136
as 0 125 136
twelve 0 125 136
and 0 125 136
suspended. 0 125 136

Inzoli 0 125 137
had 0 125 137
even 0 125 137
abused 0 125 137
boys 0 125 137
in 0 125 137
the 0 125 137
confessional, 0 125 137
convincing 0 125 137
them 0 125 137
that 0 125 137
the 1 125 137
abuse 1 125 137
was 1 125 137
approved 1 125 137
by 1 125 137
God. 1 125 137

Following 0 125 138
an 0 125 138
appeal 0 125 138
by 0 125 138
Coccopalmerio, 0 125 138
Francis 0 125 138
reduced 0 125 138
the 0 125 138
priest’s 0 125 138
penalty 0 125 138
to 0 125 138
a 0 125 138
“lifetime 0 125 138
of 0 125 138
prayer,” 0 125 138

stay 0 125 138
away 0 125 138

children. 0 125 138

The 0 125 139
uproar 0 125 139
over 0 125 139
this 0 125 139
caused 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
Italian 0 125 139
prosecutors 0 125 139
to 0 125 139
reopen 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
case 0 125 139
against 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
priest, 0 125 139
and 0 125 139
eventually 0 125 139
Inzoli 0 125 139
went 0 125 139
to 0 125 139
prison 0 125 139
and 0 125 139
was 0 125 139
laicized. 0 125 139

As 0 125 140
for 0 125 140
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0 125 140
procedural 0 125 140
reforms, 0 125 140
rumours 0 125 140
continue 0 125 140
to 0 125 140
circulate 0 125 140
that 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
pope 0 125 140
intends 0 125 140
to 0 125 140
reverse 0 125 140
them 0 125 140
as 0 125 140
well, 0 125 140
placing 0 125 140
competence 0 125 140
back 0 125 140
into 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
hands 0 125 140
of 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
same 0 125 140

that 0 125 140

it 0 125 140
when 0 125 140

denied 0 125 141
by 0 125 141
Greg 0 125 141
Burke, 0 125 141
but 0 125 141
given 1 125 141
Francis’s 1 125 141
usual 1 125 141
methods, 1 125 141
it’s 1 125 141
anyone’s 1 125 141
guess 1 125 141
who 1 125 141
in 1 125 141

is 1 125 141
actually 1 125 141
dealing 1 125 141

ignored 0 125 142

then 0 125 142
Francis 0 125 142
summarily 0 125 142
removed 0 125 142

And 0 128 14
I 0 128 14
can't 0 128 14

"I 0 128 17

possibly 0 128 17
even 0 128 17
some 0 128 17

"They're 0 128 18
not 0 128 18

I’m 0 143 3
posting 0 143 3
the 0 143 3

here 0 143 3
because 0 143 3
I'm 0 143 3
convinced 0 143 3
the 0 143 3

words 0 143 3
provide 0 143 3
recent 0 143 3
recruits 0 143 3
to 0 143 3
Tradition 0 143 3
with 0 143 3

historical 0 143 3
context 0 143 3
for 0 143 3

for 0 143 4
those 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
us 0 143 4
who’ve 0 143 4
been 0 143 4
in 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
trenches 0 143 4
for 0 143 4
a 0 143 4
long, 0 143 4
long 0 143 4
time 0 143 4
it 0 143 4
also 0 143 4
provides 0 143 4
welcome 0 143 4
reminder 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
why 0 143 4
we 0 143 4
must 0 143 4
continue 0 143 4
to 0 143 4
fight. 0 143 4

Even 0 143 5
though 0 143 5
I 0 143 5
personally 0 143 5
was 0 143 5
in 0 143 5

of 0 143 5

didn't 0 143 5
realize 0 143 5
how 0 143 5
prophetic 0 143 5
he 0 143 5
was 0 143 5
on 0 143 5
that 0 143 5
occasion, 0 143 5
or 0 143 5
how 0 143 5

encouragement 0 143 6
at 0 143 6

in 0 143 6

This 0 143 9

makes 0 143 9
it 0 143 9
absolutely 0 143 9
clear 0 143 9
that 0 143 9
everything 0 143 9
Archbishop 0 143 9
Lefebvre 0 143 9
did 0 143 9
was 0 143 9
part 0 143 9

now 0 143 10
that 0 143 10

spirit 0 143 10
of 0 143 10
Vatican 0 143 10

it 0 143 10
becomes 0 143 10
obvious 0 143 10
how 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
why 0 143 10
those 0 143 10

have 0 143 10
done 0 143 10
so 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
will 0 143 10
certainly 0 143 10
be 0 143 10
hailed 0 143 10
by 0 143 10
history 0 143 10
as 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
heroic 0 143 10
band 0 143 10
of 0 143 10
Catholic 0 143 10
brothers 0 143 10
that 0 143 10
mounted 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
twentieth 0 143 10
century’s 0 143 10
last 0 143 10
stand 0 143 10
for 0 143 10
Christ 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
King 0 143 10
and, 0 143 10
while 0 143 10
scorned 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
mocked 0 143 10
at 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
time, 0 143 10
were 0 143 10
nevertheless 0 143 10
totally 0 143 10
vindicated 0 143 10
fifty 0 143 10
years 0 143 10
later. 0 143 10

May 0 143 11
we 0 143 11
continue 0 143 11
to 0 143 11
earn 0 143 11
the 0 143 11
right 0 143 11
to 0 143 11
stand 0 143 11
with 0 143 11
them 0 143 11
today. 0 143 11

As 0 143 15
I 0 143 15
said 0 143 15
to 0 143 15
Mr. 0 143 15
[Walter] 0 143 15
Matt, 0 143 15
I 0 143 15
can 0 143 15
say 0 143 15
in 0 143 15
bad 0 143 15
English 0 143 15
what 0 143 15
he 0 143 15
says 0 143 15
in 0 143 15
good 0 143 15
English, 0 143 15
because 0 143 15
he 0 143 15
said 0 143 15
all 0 143 15
of 0 143 15
the 0 143 15
things 0 143 15
I 0 143 15
want 0 143 15
to 0 143 15
say 0 143 15
[Referring 0 143 15
here 0 143 15
to 0 143 15
Walter 0 143 15
Matt’s 0 143 15
introductory 0 143 15
talk 0 143 15
referenced 0 143 15
above.] 0 143 15

And 0 143 16
I 0 143 16
thank 0 143 16
you, 0 143 16
Mr. 0 143 16
Matt, 0 143 16
very 0 143 16
much, 0 143 16
for 0 143 16
his 0 143 16
invitation, 0 143 16
and 0 143 16
I 0 143 16
thank 0 143 16
you 0 143 16
for 0 143 16
your 0 143 16
coming, 0 143 16
and 0 143 16
I 0 143 16
thank 0 143 16
Fr. 0 143 16

Ward 0 143 17
for 0 143 17
what 0 143 17
he 0 143 17
said 0 143 17
about 0 143 17
the 0 143 17
Society 0 143 17
of 0 143 17
St. 0 143 17
Pius 0 143 17
X. 0 143 17

And 0 143 18
I 0 143 18
hope 0 143 18
that 0 143 18
you 0 143 18
can 0 143 18
understand 0 143 18
my 0 143 18
poor 0 143 18
English, 0 143 18
but 0 143 18
I 0 143 18
think 0 143 18
it 0 143 18
is 0 143 18
better 0 143 18
to 0 143 18
speak 0 143 18
some 0 143 18
bad 0 143 18
English 0 143 18
because 0 143 18
to 0 143 18
translate 0 143 18
would 0 143 18
take 0 143 18
too 0 143 18
much 0 143 18
time. 0 143 18

As 0 143 19
Mr. 0 143 19
Matt 0 143 19
said, 0 143 19
the 0 143 19
crisis 0 143 19
in 0 143 19
the 0 143 19
Church 0 143 19
is 0 143 19
very 0 143 19
extraordinary. 0 143 19

It 0 143 20
is 0 143 20
very 0 143 20
difficult 0 143 20
to 0 143 20
understand 0 143 20
the 0 143 20
situation 0 143 20
today. 0 143 20

My 0 143 21
seminary 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
Econe 0 143 21
(in 0 143 21
Switzerland) 0 143 21
and 0 143 21
the 0 143 21
seminaries 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
Germany 0 143 21
and 0 143 21
here 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
America, 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
Armada, 0 143 21
are 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
very 0 143 21
difficult 0 143 21
situations 0 143 21
with 0 143 21
Rome. 0 143 21

Why? 0 143 22

These 0 143 23
seminaries 0 143 23
are 0 143 23
the 0 143 23
same 0 143 23
as 0 143 23
seminaries 0 143 23
were 0 143 23
before 0 143 23
the 0 143 23
Second 0 143 23
Vatican 0 143 23
Council. 0 143 23

They 0 143 24
have 0 143 24
the 0 143 24
same 0 143 24
discipline 0 143 24
and 0 143 24
the 0 143 24
same 0 143 24
studies, 0 143 24
they 0 143 24
make 0 143 24
good 0 143 24
priests; 0 143 24
I 0 143 24
think 0 143 24
they 0 143 24
are 0 143 24
good 0 143 24
seminarians. 0 143 24

All 0 143 25
is 0 143 25
done 0 143 25
as 0 143 25
all 0 143 25
the 0 143 25
seminaries 0 143 25
before 0 143 25
the 0 143 25
Second 0 143 25
Vatican 0 143 25
Council. 0 143 25

Why 0 143 26
are 0 143 26
we 0 143 26
now 0 143 26
in 0 143 26
this 0 143 26
very 0 143 26
sad 0 143 26
situation 0 143 26
with 0 143 26
Rome? 0 143 26

I 0 143 27
think 0 143 27
that 0 143 27
because 0 143 27
in 0 143 27
the 0 143 27
Second 0 143 27
Vatican 0 143 27
Council, 0 143 27
and 0 143 27
after 0 143 27
the 0 143 27
Council, 0 143 27
there 0 143 27
is 0 143 27
a 1 143 27
mutation, 1 143 27
a 1 143 27
change, 1 143 27
in 1 143 27
the 1 143 27
Church. 1 143 27

But 0 143 28
we 0 143 28
do 0 143 28
not 0 143 28
change. 0 143 28

We 0 143 29
continue 0 143 29
the 0 143 29
Tradition. 0 143 29

So 0 143 30
why 0 143 30
do 0 143 30
they 0 143 30
now 0 143 30
say, 0 143 30
as 0 143 30
Mgr. 0 143 30

(Archbishop) 0 143 31
Benelli[1] 0 143 31
said 0 143 31
to 0 143 31
me 0 143 31
months 0 143 31
ago 0 143 31
on 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
19th 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
March, 0 143 31
“you 0 143 31
are 0 143 31
out 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
communion 0 143 31
with 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Church.” 0 143 31
I 0 143 31
am 0 143 31
out 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
communion 0 143 31
with 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Church 0 143 31
because 0 143 31
I 0 143 31
continue 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Tradition 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Church? 0 143 31

This 0 143 32
is 0 143 32
possible? 0 143 32

I 0 143 33
do 0 143 33
not 0 143 33
understand. 0 143 33

Why? 0 143 34

I 0 143 35
have 0 143 35
done 0 143 35
nothing. 0 143 35

I 0 143 36
believe 0 143 36
nothing 0 143 36
other 0 143 36
than 0 143 36
what 0 143 36
the 0 143 36
Church 0 143 36
has 0 143 36
believed 0 143 36
for 0 143 36
twenty 0 143 36
centuries. 0 143 36

Mgr. 0 143 37

Benelli 0 143 38
then 0 143 38
said 0 143 38
to 0 143 38
me, 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
must 0 143 38
put 0 143 38
down 0 143 38
in 0 143 38
a 0 143 38
writing 0 143 38
to 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
Holy 0 143 38
Father 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
accept 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
Second 0 143 38
Vatican 0 143 38
Council, 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
accept 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
reform 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
followed 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
Council, 0 143 38
and 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
accept 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
orientations 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
have 0 143 38
been 0 143 38
given 0 143 38
by 0 143 38
Rome. 0 143 38

Mgr. 0 143 39

Benelli 0 143 40
took 0 143 40
the 0 143 40
book 0 143 40
of 0 143 40
the 0 143 40
New 0 143 40
Ordo, 0 143 40
gave 0 143 40
it 0 143 40
to 0 143 40
me, 0 143 40
and 0 143 40
said, 0 143 40
“You 0 143 40
must 0 143 40
say 0 143 40
this 0 143 40
New 0 143 40
Mass 0 143 40
in 0 143 40
all 0 143 40
of 0 143 40
your 0 143 40
houses.” 0 143 40

I 0 143 41
wonder 0 143 41
why 0 143 41
Mgr. 0 143 41

Benelli 0 143 42
did 0 143 42
not 0 143 42
communicate 0 143 42
this 0 143 42
condition 0 143 42
to 0 143 42
me 0 143 42
before 0 143 42
our 0 143 42
meeting. 0 143 42

[2] 0 143 43
He 0 143 43
could 0 143 43
have 0 143 43
done 0 143 43
so. 0 143 43

For 0 143 44
example, 0 143 44
one 0 143 44
year 0 143 44
ago 0 143 44
three 0 143 44
cardinals 0 143 44
sent 0 143 44
me 0 143 44
a 0 143 44
letter 0 143 44
(Cardinals 0 143 44
Wright, 0 143 44
Tabera 0 143 44
[Arturo 0 143 44
Carinal 0 143 44
Tabera 0 143 44
Araoz, 0 143 44
one 0 143 44
of 0 143 44
the 0 143 44
Council 0 143 44
Fathers 0 143 44
MJM], 0 143 44
and 0 143 44
Gabriel-Marie 0 143 44
Garrone) 0 143 44
telling 0 143 44
me 0 143 44
(in 0 143 44
effect) 0 143 44
that 0 143 44
I 0 143 44
must 0 143 44
close 0 143 44
the 0 143 44
seminaries. 0 143 44

Well, 0 143 45
I 0 143 45
refused, 0 143 45
because 0 143 45
I 1 143 45
refuse 1 143 45
to 1 143 45
contribute 1 143 45
to 1 143 45
the 1 143 45
destruction 1 143 45
of 1 143 45
the 1 143 45
Church. 1 143 45

Because 0 143 46
now 0 143 46
they 0 143 46
are 0 143 46
destroying 1 143 46
the 1 143 46
Church. 1 143 46

When 0 143 47
I 0 143 47
die 0 143 47
and 0 143 47
go 0 143 47
before 0 143 47
the 0 143 47
judge, 0 143 47
God 0 143 47
will 0 143 47
not 0 143 47
be 0 143 47
able 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
say 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
me, 0 143 47
“You 1 143 47
destroyed 1 143 47
the 1 143 47
Church.” 1 143 47
I 0 143 47
refused 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
contribute 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
the 0 143 47
destruction 1 143 47
of 1 143 47
the 1 143 47
Church. 1 143 47

I 0 143 48
am 0 143 48
sure 0 143 48
that 0 143 48
my 0 143 48
seminaries 0 143 48
are 0 143 48
contributing 0 143 48
to 0 143 48
the 0 143 48
restoration 0 143 48
of 0 143 48
the 0 143 48
Church. 0 143 48

I 0 143 49
do 0 143 49
not 0 143 49
destroy 0 143 49
the 0 143 49
Church. 0 143 49

And 0 143 50
so 0 143 50
I 0 143 50
said 0 143 50
to 0 143 50
Mgr. 0 143 50

Benelli, 0 143 51
“No, 0 143 51
I 0 143 51
will 0 143 51
not 0 143 51
sign 0 143 51
that 0 143 51
writing.” 0 143 51

I 0 143 52
think 0 143 52
that 0 143 52
the 1 143 52
mutation 1 143 52
in 1 143 52
the 1 143 52
Church 1 143 52
came 0 143 52
in 0 143 52
through 0 143 52
the 0 143 52
Second 0 143 52
Vatican 0 143 52
Council. 0 143 52

And 0 143 53
do 0 143 53
you 0 143 53
think 0 143 53
this 0 143 53
change 0 143 53
in 0 143 53
the 0 143 53
Church 0 143 53
came 0 143 53
suddenly? 0 143 53

When, 0 143 54
then? 0 143 54

At 0 143 55
the 0 143 55
beginning 0 143 55
of 0 143 55
the 0 143 55
Council? 0 143 55

No, 0 143 56
this 0 143 56
change 0 143 56
in 0 143 56
the 0 143 56
Church 0 143 56
began 0 143 56
one 0 143 56
century 0 143 56
before 0 143 56
[the 0 143 56
Council]. 0 143 56

Pope 0 143 57
Pius 0 143 57
VI 0 143 57
said 0 143 57
during 0 143 57
the 0 143 57
French 0 143 57
Revolution 0 143 57
that 0 143 57
if 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
Church 1 143 57
continues 1 143 57
to 1 143 57
remain 1 143 57
under 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
influence 1 143 57
of 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
prince 1 143 57
of 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
revolution, 1 143 57
then, 1 143 57
in 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
future 1 143 57
a 1 143 57
crisis 1 143 57
will 1 143 57
come 1 143 57
upon 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
Church. 1 143 57

In 0 143 58
[1844], 0 143 58
Pope 0 143 58
Pius 0 143 58
IX 0 143 58
ordered 0 143 58
Cardinal 0 143 58
Rigoli 0 143 58
to 0 143 58
publish 0 143 58
the 0 143 58
Instructions 0 143 58
of 0 143 58
the 0 143 58
Carbonari. 0 143 58

[3] 0 143 59
The 0 143 59
Pope 0 143 59
himself 0 143 59
asked 0 143 59
Cardinal 0 143 59
Rigoli 0 143 59
to 0 143 59
publish 0 143 59
the 0 143 59
Instructions 0 143 59
of 0 143 59
the 0 143 59
Carbonari. 0 143 59

And 0 143 60
what 0 143 60
did 0 143 60
these 0 143 60
Instructions 0 143 60
say? 0 143 60

The 0 143 61
Instructions 0 143 61
said 0 143 61
that 0 143 61
they 0 143 61
[the 0 143 61
Carbonari/Freemasons] 0 143 61
must 0 143 61
begin 0 143 61
to 0 143 61
fight 0 143 61
against 0 143 61
the 0 143 61
Church 0 143 61
by 0 143 61
bringing 0 143 61
reform 0 143 61
into 0 143 61
the 0 143 61
Church. 0 143 61

The 0 143 62
Instructions 0 143 62
said 0 143 62
the 0 143 62
infiltration 0 143 62
will 0 143 62
take 0 143 62
perhaps 0 143 62
not 0 143 62
one 0 143 62
year, 0 143 62
perhaps 0 143 62
not 0 143 62
ten 0 143 62
years, 0 143 62
but 0 143 62
perhaps 0 143 62
a 0 143 62
century. 0 143 62

The 0 143 63
Carbonari 0 143 63
must 0 143 63
enter 0 143 63
into 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
seminary, 0 143 63
into 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
convent, 0 143 63
into 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
sacristy, 0 143 63
and 0 143 63
slowly, 0 143 63
very 0 143 63
slowly, 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
priests 0 143 63
will 0 143 63
have 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
ideals 0 143 63
of 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
revolution; 0 143 63
of 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
Freemasons. 0 143 63

One 0 143 64
day 0 143 64
these 0 143 64
priests, 0 143 64
imbued 0 143 64
with 0 143 64
Masonic 0 143 64
principles, 0 143 64
will 0 143 64
become 0 143 64
bishops, 0 143 64
and 0 143 64
these 0 143 64
bishops 0 143 64
can 0 143 64
then 0 143 64
choose 0 143 64
a 0 143 64
pope. 0 143 64

And 0 143 65
even 0 143 65
if 0 143 65
the 0 143 65
pope 0 143 65
is 0 143 65
not 0 143 65
a 0 143 65
Freemason, 0 143 65
he 0 143 65
will 0 143 65
have 0 143 65
the 0 143 65
same 0 143 65
ideals 0 143 65
as 0 143 65
the 0 143 65
Freemasons. 0 143 65

Pope 0 143 66
Pius 0 143 66
IX 0 143 66
called 0 143 66
for 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
publishing 0 143 66
of 0 143 66
these 0 143 66
Instructions 0 143 66
in 0 143 66
order 0 143 66
to 0 143 66
warn 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
bishops 0 143 66
and 0 143 66
priests 0 143 66
of 0 143 66
those 0 143 66
times 0 143 66
of 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
fight 0 143 66
against 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
church. 0 143 66

In 0 143 67
1895, 0 143 67
the 0 143 67
Catholic 0 143 67
Antonia 0 143 67
Fogazzaro, 0 143 67
a 0 143 67
known 0 143 67
modernist, 0 143 67
founded 0 143 67
a 0 143 67
masonic 0 143 67
lodge 0 143 67
in 0 143 67
Milan. 0 143 67

He 0 143 68
wrote 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
his 0 143 68
book, 0 143 68
Il 0 143 68
Santo, 0 143 68
that 0 143 68
“We 0 143 68
[modernists]…want 0 143 68
a 0 143 68
reform 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
the 0 143 68
Church…without 0 143 68
rebellion, 0 143 68
carried 0 143 68
out 0 143 68
by 0 143 68
legitimate 0 143 68
authority…even 0 143 68
if 0 143 68
this 0 143 68
takes 0 143 68
20, 0 143 68
30, 0 143 68
or 0 143 68
50 0 143 68
years.”[4] 0 143 68
“The 0 143 68
reform 0 143 68
will 0 143 68
have 0 143 68
to 0 143 68
be 0 143 68
brought 0 143 68
about 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
the 0 143 68
name 0 143 68
of 0 143 68
obedience.” 0 143 68
The 0 143 68
modernist 0 143 68
ideas 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
the 0 143 68
Church 0 143 68
introduced 0 143 68
and 0 143 68
enacted 0 143 68
through 0 143 68
obedience! 0 143 68

And 0 143 69
I 0 143 69
think…well, 0 143 69
here 0 143 69
we 0 143 69
are! 0 143 69

In 0 143 70
this 0 143 70
time! 0 143 70

The 0 143 71
reform 0 143 71
is 0 143 71
here, 0 143 71
and 0 143 71
it 0 143 71
is 0 143 71
brought 0 143 71
about 0 143 71
through 0 143 71
obedience, 0 143 71
to 0 143 71
the 0 143 71
Council, 0 143 71
to 0 143 71
the 0 143 71
bishop, 0 143 71
to 0 143 71
the 0 143 71
priest. 0 143 71

And 0 143 72
all 0 143 72
they 0 143 72
say 0 143 72
is 0 143 72
“Obedience, 0 143 72
obedience, 0 143 72
obedience.” 0 143 72

The 0 143 73
Instructions 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
Carbonari 0 143 73
say 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
bishop 0 143 73
and 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
priest 0 143 73
will 0 143 73
think 0 143 73
that 0 143 73
they 0 143 73
are 0 143 73
following 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
tiara 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
Pope, 0 143 73
but 0 143 73
they 0 143 73
will 0 143 73
be 0 143 73
following 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
flag 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
Freemasonry 0 143 73
[“the 0 143 73
banner 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
revolution”]. 0 143 73

They 1 143 74
said 1 143 74
that. 1 143 74

They 1 143 75
wrote 1 143 75
that! 1 143 75

One 0 143 76
century 0 143 76
before 0 143 76
[the 0 143 76
Council]! 0 143 76

Thus, 0 143 77
it 0 143 77
is 0 143 77
very 0 143 77
important 0 143 77
to 0 143 77
know 0 143 77
that 0 143 77
they 0 143 77
prepared 0 143 77
for 0 143 77
the 0 143 77
beginning 0 143 77
of 0 143 77
the 0 143 77
Second 0 143 77
Vatican 0 143 77
Council 0 143 77
for 0 143 77
a 0 143 77
century, 0 143 77
perhaps 0 143 77
two 0 143 77
centuries! 0 143 77

As 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Archbishop 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
Dakar 0 143 78
and 0 143 78
President 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Episcopal 0 143 78
Commission 0 143 78
for 0 143 78
French-speaking 0 143 78
West 0 143 78
Africa, 0 143 78
I 0 143 78
was 0 143 78
appointed 0 143 78
member 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Central 0 143 78
Preparatory 0 143 78
Commission 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Second 0 143 78
Vatican 0 143 78
Council. 0 143 78

There 0 143 79
were 0 143 79
some 0 143 79
seventy 0 143 79
cardinals, 0 143 79
twenty 0 143 79
bishops, 0 143 79
and 0 143 79
four 0 143 79
super-authorities 0 143 79
of 0 143 79
the 0 143 79
religious 0 143 79
orders, 0 143 79
among 0 143 79
others. 0 143 79

Before 0 143 80
the 0 143 80
last 0 143 80
meeting 0 143 80
of 0 143 80
this 0 143 80
Commission 0 143 80
the 0 143 80
members 0 143 80
received 0 143 80
two 0 143 80
schemas 0 143 80
on 0 143 80
the 0 143 80
same 0 143 80
subject: 0 143 80
one 0 143 80
from 0 143 80
Cardinal 0 143 80
Ottaviani 0 143 80
and 0 143 80
another 0 143 80
from 0 143 80
Cardinal 0 143 80
Bea. 0 143 80

The 0 143 81
schema 0 143 81
from 0 143 81
Cardinal 0 143 81
Ottaviani 0 143 81
was 0 143 81
titled 0 143 81
“…On 0 143 81
Religious 0 143 81
Tolerance” 0 143 81
and 0 143 81
the 0 143 81
other, 0 143 81
from 0 143 81
Cardinal 0 143 81
Bea, 0 143 81
was 0 143 81
titled 0 143 81
“On 0 143 81
Religious 0 143 81
Freedom 0 143 81
[Liberty].” 0 143 81
When 0 143 81
we 0 143 81
read 0 143 81
these 0 143 81
two 0 143 81
schemas, 0 143 81
we 0 143 81
thought, 0 143 81
“This 0 143 81
is 0 143 81
impossible. 0 143 81

How 0 143 82
is 0 143 82
it 0 143 82
we 0 143 82
can 0 143 82
receive 0 143 82
two 0 143 82
opposing 0 143 82
theses? 0 143 82

One 0 143 83
says 0 143 83
we 0 143 83
must 0 143 83
not 0 143 83
tolerate 0 143 83
error. 0 143 83

The 0 143 84
other 0 143 84
says 0 143 84
that 0 143 84
error 0 143 84
has 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
right 0 143 84
to 0 143 84
exist 0 143 84
in 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
name 0 143 84
of 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
dignity 0 143 84
of 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
human 0 143 84
person.” 0 143 84
And 0 143 84
so, 0 143 84
we 0 143 84
go 0 143 84
into 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
meeting. 0 143 84

Cardinal 0 143 85
Ottaviani, 0 143 85
standing, 0 143 85
says 0 143 85
to 0 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Bea, 0 143 85
“You 1 143 85
have 1 143 85
no 1 143 85
authority 1 143 85
to 1 143 85
compose 1 143 85
this 1 143 85
schema, 1 143 85
because 1 143 85
it 1 143 85
is 1 143 85
a 1 143 85
theological 1 143 85
thesis 1 143 85
and 1 143 85
therefore 1 143 85
within 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
competence 1 143 85
of 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
Theological 1 143 85
Commission.” 1 143 85
As 0 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Bea 0 143 85
stands 0 143 85
up, 0 143 85
he 0 143 85
says, 0 143 85
“I 0 143 85
do 1 143 85
have 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
right 1 143 85
to 1 143 85
compose 1 143 85
this 1 143 85
schema 1 143 85
because 1 143 85
if 1 143 85
anything 1 143 85
concerns 1 143 85
Christian 1 143 85
Unity 1 143 85
it 1 143 85
is 1 143 85
religious 1 143 85
liberty, 1 143 85
and 1 143 85
I 1 143 85
am 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
President 1 143 85
of 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
Secretariat 1 143 85
for 1 143 85
Promoting 1 143 85
Christian 1 143 85
Unity.” 1 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Bea, 0 143 85
addressing 0 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Ottaviani, 0 143 85
further 0 143 85
said, 0 143 85
“I 0 143 85
am 0 143 85
opposed 0 143 85
to 0 143 85
your 0 143 85
schema.” 0 143 85

Impossible! 1 143 86

We 1 143 87
were 1 143 87
in 1 143 87
a 1 143 87
very 1 143 87
sad, 1 143 87
serious 1 143 87
situation. 1 143 87

Cardinal 0 143 88
Ruffini 0 143 88
had 0 143 88
to 0 143 88
intervene 0 143 88
as 0 143 88
we 0 143 88
were 0 143 88
in 0 143 88
front 0 143 88
of 0 143 88
two 0 143 88
cardinals, 0 143 88
our 0 143 88
brothers. 0 143 88

He 0 143 89
said 0 143 89
we 0 143 89
must 0 143 89
wait 0 143 89
for 0 143 89
the 0 143 89
authority 0 143 89
to 0 143 89
say 0 143 89
who 0 143 89
is 0 143 89
right 0 143 89
and 0 143 89
who 0 143 89
is 0 143 89
wrong. 0 143 89

But 0 143 90
before 0 143 90
the 0 143 90
Pope 0 143 90
came 0 143 90
(because 0 143 90
the 0 143 90
Pope 0 143 90
came 0 143 90
many 0 143 90
times 0 143 90
to 0 143 90
present 0 143 90
at 0 143 90
these 0 143 90
meetings) 0 143 90
we 0 143 90
voted 0 143 90
on 0 143 90
the 0 143 90
schema. 0 143 90

Who 0 143 91
is 0 143 91
with 0 143 91
Cardinal 0 143 91
Ottaviani? 0 143 91

Who 0 143 92
is 0 143 92
with 0 143 92
Cardinal 0 143 92
Bea? 0 143 92

The 0 143 93
conservatives 0 143 93
and 0 143 93
the 0 143 93
liberals. 0 143 93

As 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
last 0 143 94
meeting 0 143 94
of 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
Preparatory 0 143 94
Commission, 0 143 94
it 0 143 94
was 0 143 94
for 0 143 94
me 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
first 0 143 94
image 0 143 94
of 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
future 0 143 94
Council. 0 143 94

This 0 143 95
historic 0 143 95
address 0 143 95
appeared 0 143 95
for 0 143 95

the 0 143 97

you 0 143 97

Cardinal 0 143 97

with 0 143 97
all 0 143 97

the 0 143 97

And 0 143 98
now 0 143 98
one 0 143 98
month 0 143 98

in 0 143 98

the 0 143 98

of 0 143 98
the 0 143 98

the 0 143 98
date 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
his 0 143 98
inscription 0 143 98
in 0 143 98
Masonry, 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
date 0 143 98
[of 0 143 98
his 0 143 98
rising 0 143 98
to] 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
20th 0 143 98
Degree 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry, 1 143 98
the 0 143 98
date 0 143 98
[of 0 143 98
his 0 143 98
rising 0 143 98
to] 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
30th 0 143 98
Degree 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry, 1 143 98
and 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
places 0 143 98
where 0 143 98
he 0 143 98
[attended] 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
meetings 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry. 1 143 98

This 0 143 99
Cardinal 0 143 99
was 0 143 99
the 0 143 99
chief 0 143 99
of 0 143 99
the 0 143 99
liberals 0 143 99
in 0 143 99
the 0 143 99
Council. 0 143 99

That 0 143 100
is 0 143 100
my 0 143 100
cardinal; 0 143 100
he 0 143 100
ordained 0 143 100
me 0 143 100
to 0 143 100
the 0 143 100
priesthood, 0 143 100
and 0 143 100
he 0 143 100
consecrated 0 143 100
me 0 143 100
a 0 143 100
bishop. 0 143 100

And 0 143 101
now 0 143 101
this 0 143 101
is 0 143 101
public. 0 143 101

Nobody 0 143 102
has 0 143 102
been 0 143 102
able 0 143 102
to 0 143 102
refute 0 143 102
the 0 143 102
publication. 0 143 102

And 0 143 103
so, 0 143 103
we 0 143 103
have 0 143 103
(I 0 143 103
am 0 143 103
confident) 0 143 103
a 1 143 103
mutation 1 143 103
in 1 143 103
the 1 143 103
church 1 143 103
by 0 143 103
the 0 143 103
Council 0 143 103
and 0 143 103
by 0 143 103
the 0 143 103
reform 0 143 103
after 0 143 103
the 0 143 103
Council. 0 143 103

Now, 0 143 104
some 0 143 104
say 0 143 104
the 0 143 104
Council 0 143 104
is 0 143 104
(was) 0 143 104
good, 0 143 104
but 0 143 104
only 0 143 104
the 0 143 104
reforms 0 143 104
were 0 143 104
bad. 0 143 104

That 0 143 105
is 0 143 105
not 0 143 105
true. 0 143 105

Why? 0 143 106

Because 0 143 107
when 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
reforms 0 143 107
come, 0 143 107
Rome 0 143 107
always 0 143 107
says 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
reforms 0 143 107
are 0 143 107
being 0 143 107
done 0 143 107
in 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
name 0 143 107
of 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
Council. 0 143 107

In 1 143 108
the 1 143 108
name 1 143 108
of 1 143 108
the 1 143 108
Council! 1 143 108

It 0 143 109
is 0 143 109
evident 0 143 109
that 0 143 109
all 0 143 109
of 0 143 109
the 0 143 109
reforms 0 143 109
came 0 143 109
from 0 143 109
the 0 143 109
Council. 0 143 109

And 0 143 110
if 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
reforms 1 143 110
are 1 143 110
bad, 1 143 110
then 1 143 110
it 1 143 110
is 1 143 110
impossible 1 143 110
that 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
Council 1 143 110
is 1 143 110
good 1 143 110
and 1 143 110
all 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
reforms 1 143 110
are 1 143 110
bad, 1 143 110
because 1 143 110
that 1 143 110
is 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
authentic 1 143 110
interpretation 1 143 110
of 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
Council 1 143 110
by 1 143 110
Rome. 1 143 110

Rome 0 143 111
said 0 143 111
in 0 143 111
the 0 143 111
name 0 143 111
of 0 143 111
the 0 143 111
Declaration 0 143 111
of 0 143 111
Liturgy, 0 143 111
we 0 143 111
[implement] 0 143 111
the 0 143 111
liturgical 0 143 111
reform. 0 143 111

We 0 143 112
can 0 143 112
say 0 143 112
that 0 143 112
[these 0 143 112
bad 0 143 112
changes 0 143 112
are] 0 143 112
not 0 143 112
in 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
text 0 143 112
of 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
Declaration, 0 143 112
but 0 143 112
this 0 143 112
man 0 143 112
has 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
authority 0 143 112
to 0 143 112
say 0 143 112
that 0 143 112
this 0 143 112
is 0 143 112
from 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
Council. 0 143 112

They 0 143 113
know 0 143 113
that. 0 143 113

And 0 143 114
I 0 143 114
am 0 143 114
sure 0 143 114
that 0 143 114
it 0 143 114
[the 0 143 114
mutation] 0 143 114
is 0 143 114
in 0 143 114
the 0 143 114
Council. 0 143 114

Even 0 143 115
if 0 143 115
it 0 143 115
is 0 143 115
not 0 143 115
explicitly 0 143 115
[stated] 0 143 115
in 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
Council 0 143 115
but 0 143 115
[rather] 0 143 115
in 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
spirit 0 143 115
of 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
Council, 0 143 115
it 0 143 115
is 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
same! 0 143 115

For 0 143 116
example, 0 143 116
with 0 143 116
religious 0 143 116
freedom: 0 143 116
now 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Holy 0 143 116
See 0 143 116
and 0 143 116
all 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Nuncios 0 143 116
are 0 143 116
against 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Catholic 0 143 116
State 0 143 116
in 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
name 0 143 116
of 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Council 0 143 116
- 0 143 116
in 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
name 0 143 116
of 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Declaration 0 143 116
of 0 143 116
Religious 0 143 116
Freedom. 0 143 116

I 0 143 117
have 0 143 117
heard 0 143 117
this 0 143 117
(personally) 0 143 117
twice. 0 143 117

The 0 143 118
first 0 143 118
time 0 143 118
I 0 143 118
was 0 143 118
in 0 143 118
Columbia. 0 143 118

When 0 143 119
I 0 143 119
was 0 143 119
in 0 143 119
Columbia, 0 143 119
I 0 143 119
read 0 143 119
in 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
paper 0 143 119
about 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
change 0 143 119
in 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
first 0 143 119
article 0 143 119
of 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
Constitution 0 143 119
of 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
Republic 0 143 119
of 0 143 119
Columbia. 0 143 119

[The 0 143 120
first 0 143 120
article] 0 143 120
stated 0 143 120
that 0 143 120
only 0 143 120
the 0 143 120
Republic 0 143 120
of 0 143 120
Columbia 0 143 120
recognizes 0 143 120
only 0 143 120
the 0 143 120
Catholic 0 143 120
religion. 0 143 120

They 0 143 121
changed 0 143 121
it. 0 143 121

They 0 143 122
removed 0 143 122
this 0 143 122
article. 0 143 122

I 0 143 123
read 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
discourse 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
President 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
Columbia 0 143 123
with 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
Nuncios 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
Columbia 0 143 123
and 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
Secretary 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
Episcopal 0 143 123
Conference 0 143 123
in 0 143 123
Columbia. 0 143 123

The 0 143 124
President 0 143 124
said 0 143 124
he 0 143 124
is 0 143 124
very, 1 143 124
very 1 143 124
anxious. 1 143 124

He 0 143 125
said 0 143 125
to 0 143 125
the 0 143 125
people, 0 143 125
“even 0 143 125
though 0 143 125
we 0 143 125
remove 0 143 125
this 0 143 125
article 0 143 125
we 0 143 125
remain 0 143 125
Catholic. 0 143 125

I 0 143 126
am 0 143 126
a 0 143 126
Catholic, 0 143 126
I 0 143 126
shall 0 143 126
remain 0 143 126
Catholic, 0 143 126
and 0 143 126
I 1 143 126
do 1 143 126
everything 1 143 126
possible 1 143 126
for 1 143 126
the 1 143 126
Council 1 143 126
and 1 143 126
the 1 143 126
Catholics 1 143 126
in 1 143 126
our 1 143 126
country.” 1 143 126

Then, 0 143 127
the 0 143 127
discourse 0 143 127
of 0 143 127
the 0 143 127
Nuncio 0 143 127
was 0 143 127
the 0 143 127
discourse 0 143 127
of 0 143 127
a 0 143 127
Freemason: 0 143 127
all 0 143 127
of 0 143 127
it 0 143 127
was 0 143 127
“progress,” 0 143 127
“humanity,” 0 143 127
“evolution,” 0 143 127
and 0 143 127
all 0 143 127
the 0 143 127
hubris 0 143 127
of 0 143 127
a 0 143 127
Freemason. 0 143 127

And 0 143 128
during 0 143 128
the 0 143 128
discourse 0 143 128
of 0 143 128
the 0 143 128
Secretary 0 143 128
of 0 143 128
the 0 143 128
Episcopal 0 143 128
Conference, 0 143 128
[the 0 143 128
Secretary] 0 143 128
said, 0 143 128
“in 1 143 128
the 1 143 128
name 1 143 128
of 1 143 128

Declaration 1 143 128

Freedom 1 143 128
[of 1 143 128
Vatican 1 143 128
II], 1 143 128
we 1 143 128
ask 1 143 128
the 1 143 128
President 1 143 128
to 1 143 128
remove 1 143 128
this 1 143 128
article 1 143 128
in 1 143 128
the 1 143 128
Constitution.” 1 143 128

I 0 143 129
met 0 143 129
this 0 143 129
Secretary 0 143 129
of 0 143 129
the 0 143 129
Episcopal 0 143 129
Conference 0 143 129
during 0 143 129
my 0 143 129
visit 0 143 129
in 0 143 129
Columbia, 0 143 129
and 0 143 129
he 0 143 129
said 0 143 129
for 0 143 129
two 0 143 129
years 0 143 129
they 0 143 129
[had 0 143 129
been 0 143 129
asking] 0 143 129
the 0 143 129
President, 0 143 129
in 1 143 129
the 1 143 129
name 1 143 129
of 1 143 129
the 1 143 129
Holy 1 143 129
See, 1 143 129
to 0 143 129
change 0 143 129

But 0 143 130
I 0 143 130
will 0 143 130
never…I 0 143 130
do 0 143 130
not 0 143 130
accept 0 143 130
the 0 143 130
concept, 0 143 130
because 0 143 130
you 0 143 130
destroy 0 143 130
the 0 143 130
Catholic 0 143 130

Are 0 143 131
you 0 143 131
sure? 0 143 131

Yes, 0 143 132
sure. 0 143 132

It 0 143 133
is 0 143 133
evident. 0 143 133

Now 0 143 134
I 0 143 134
said 0 143 134
to 0 143 134
the 0 143 134
[Secretary], 0 143 134
“As 0 143 134
I 0 143 134

(Because 0 143 135
you 0 143 135
know 0 143 135
Switzerland 0 143 135

[the 0 143 138

said, 0 143 138
“Yes, 0 143 138

Brother, 0 143 138
what 0 143 138
did 0 143 138
you 0 143 138

is 0 143 139
this 0 143 139
for 0 143 139
you? 0 143 139

What 0 143 140
do 0 143 140
you 0 143 140
say 0 143 140
when 0 143 140
you 0 143 140
say 0 143 140
“thy 0 143 140
kingdom 0 143 140
come” 0 143 140
in 0 143 140
your 0 143 140
prayer, 0 143 140
the 0 143 140
Our 0 143 140
Father? 0 143 140

“Ah,” 0 143 141
the 0 143 141
Nuncio 0 143 141
said 0 143 141
to 0 143 141
me, 0 143 141
“Now 0 143 141
it 0 143 141
is 0 143 141
impossible.” 0 143 141
What 0 143 141
did 0 143 141
you 0 143 141
do 0 143 141
with 0 143 141
the 0 143 141
encyclical 0 143 141

Quas 0 143 141
Primas? 0 143 141

“Ah, 0 143 142
but 0 143 142
now 0 143 142
the 0 143 142
Pope 0 143 142
cannot 0 143 142
write 0 143 142
an 0 143 142
encyclical 0 143 142
like 0 143 142
Quas 0 143 142
Primas.” 0 143 142

It 0 143 143
is 0 143 143
incredible. 0 143 143

And 0 143 144
all 0 143 144
in 1 143 144
the 1 143 144
name 1 143 144
of 1 143 144
the 1 143 144
Council. 1 143 144

We 1 143 145
must 1 143 145
take 1 143 145
care, 1 143 145
because 1 143 145
this 1 143 145
change 1 143 145
in 1 143 145
the 1 143 145
church 1 143 145
is 1 143 145
a 1 143 145
liberal 1 143 145
change. 1 143 145

The 1 143 146
liberal 1 143 146
principles 1 143 146
have 1 143 146
entered 1 143 146
the 1 143 146
Church 1 143 146
now, 1 143 146
and 1 143 146
they 1 143 146
destroy 1 143 146
the 1 143 146
Church. 1 143 146

If 0 143 147
we 0 143 147
cannot 0 143 147
set 0 143 147
out 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
true 0 143 147
principles 0 143 147
of 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
Church, 0 143 147
if 0 143 147
we 0 143 147
in 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
name 0 143 147
of 0 143 147
religious 0 143 147
freedom 0 143 147
said 0 143 147
that 0 143 147
all 0 143 147
religions 0 143 147
have 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
same 0 143 147
right 0 143 147
in 0 143 147
every 0 143 147
state 0 143 147
in 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
world… 0 143 147

[missing 0 143 148
audio...] 0 143 148

The 0 143 149
truth 0 143 149
is 0 143 149
the 0 143 149
only 0 143 149
one 0 143 149
King 0 143 149
of 0 143 149
the 0 143 149
World 0 143 149
is 0 143 149
Jesus 0 143 149
Christ. 0 143 149

We 0 143 150
say 0 143 150
in 0 143 150
the 0 143 150
Gloria 0 143 150
in 0 143 150
Excelsis 0 143 150
Deo, 0 143 150
“Tu 0 143 150
solus 0 143 150
Altissimus,” 0 143 150
“Tu 0 143 150
solus 0 143 150
Dominus,” 0 143 150
“You 0 143 150
alone 0 143 150

the 0 143 150
Highest,” 0 143 150
“You 0 143 150
alone 0 143 150
are 0 143 150
the 0 143 150
Lord.” 0 143 150
But 0 143 150
practically, 0 143 150
we 0 143 150
would 0 143 150
refuse 0 143 150
this 0 143 150
Kingdom 0 143 150
of 0 143 150
Jesus 0 143 150
Christ 0 143 150
if 0 143 150
we 0 143 150
said 0 143 150
that 0 143 150
Luther, 0 143 150
Mohammed, 0 143 150
Buddha 0 143 150
and 0 143 150
Jesus 0 143 150
Christ 0 143 150
are 0 143 150
all 0 143 150
the 0 143 150
same. 0 143 150

We 0 143 151
cannot 0 143 151
say 0 143 151
that. 0 143 151

Impossible. 1 143 152

We 0 143 153
know 0 143 153
that 0 143 153
in 0 143 153
many 0 143 153
states 0 143 153
(it 0 143 153
is 0 143 153
a 0 143 153
pity) 0 143 153
it 0 143 153
is 0 143 153
impossible 0 143 153
[to 0 143 153
recognize 0 143 153
Catholicism 0 143 153
as 0 143 153
the 0 143 153
state 0 143 153
religion]. 0 143 153

We 1 143 154
must 1 143 154
tolerate 1 143 154
- 1 143 154
have 1 143 154
tolerance 1 143 154
for 1 143 154
the 1 143 154
error 1 143 154
- 1 143 154
but 1 143 154
never 1 143 154
give 1 143 154
the 1 143 154
same 1 143 154
right 1 143 154
to 1 143 154
error 1 143 154
and 1 143 154
truth. 1 143 154

That 1 143 155
is 1 143 155
impossible. 1 143 155

And 0 143 156
the 0 143 156
change 0 143 156
in 0 143 156
the 0 143 156
liturgy 0 143 156
is 0 143 156
very 0 143 156
important. 0 143 156

It 0 143 157
is 0 143 157
very 0 143 157
bad. 0 143 157

One 0 143 158
of 0 143 158
the 0 143 158
principles 0 143 158
of 0 143 158
modern 0 143 158
man, 0 143 158
as 0 143 158
they 0 143 158
say 0 143 158
now, 0 143 158
“modern 0 143 158
man,” 0 143 158
is 0 143 158
democracy. 0 143 158

And 0 143 159
democracy 0 143 159
can 0 143 159
have 0 143 159
a 0 143 159
good 0 143 159
sense 0 143 159
but 0 143 159
not 0 143 159
if 0 143 159
[by 0 143 159
that 0 143 159
term 0 143 159
is 0 143 159
meant] 0 143 159
that 0 143 159
those 0 143 159
who 0 143 159
govern 0 143 159
receive 0 143 159
their 0 143 159
authority 0 143 159
from 0 143 159
the 0 143 159
people. 0 143 159

The 1 143 160
authority 1 143 160
comes 1 143 160
from 1 143 160
God. 1 143 160

Not 1 143 161
from 1 143 161
the 1 143 161
people. 1 143 161

Not 1 143 162
from 1 143 162
the 1 143 162
masses. 1 143 162

From 1 143 163
God. 1 143 163

But 0 143 164
today 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
principle, 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
democratic 1 143 164
principle, 1 143 164
is 0 143 164
that 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
authority 0 143 164
is 0 143 164
in 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
people. 0 143 164

It 0 143 165
is 0 143 165
in 1 143 165
the 1 143 165
masses. 1 143 165

That 0 143 166
is 0 143 166
not 0 143 166
true. 0 143 166

It 0 143 167
is 0 143 167
impossible. 0 143 167

And 0 143 168
our 0 143 168
liturgy 0 143 168
is 0 143 168
the 0 143 168
school 0 143 168
of 0 143 168
our 0 143 168
Faith. 0 143 168

It 0 143 169
is 0 143 169
the 0 143 169
first 0 143 169
school 0 143 169
of 0 143 169
our 0 143 169
Faith 0 143 169
for 0 143 169
all 0 143 169
people. 0 143 169

I 0 143 170
was 0 143 170
in 0 143 170
Africa 0 143 170
as 0 143 170
a 0 143 170
missionary 0 143 170
and 0 143 170
as 0 143 170
bishop 0 143 170
for 0 143 170
30 0 143 170
years. 0 143 170

I 0 143 171
know 0 143 171
the 0 143 171
liturgy 0 143 171
was 0 143 171
the 0 143 171
best 0 143 171
school 0 143 171
of 0 143 171
the 0 143 171
Faith 0 143 171
for 0 143 171
people 0 143 171
who 0 143 171
cannot 0 143 171
read. 0 143 171

They 0 143 172
can 0 143 172
see 0 143 172
what 0 143 172
the 0 143 172
priest 0 143 172
does. 0 143 172

They 0 143 173
can 0 143 173
see 0 143 173
what 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
priest 0 143 173
does 0 143 173
at 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
adoration 0 143 173
of 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
Body 0 143 173
and 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
Blood 0 143 173
of 0 143 173
Jesus 0 143 173
Christ. 0 143 173

And 0 143 174
they 0 143 174
know 0 143 174
that 0 143 174
Jesus 0 143 174
Christ 0 143 174
is 0 143 174
present 0 143 174
- 0 143 174
His 0 143 174
real 0 143 174
presence 0 143 174
is 0 143 174
on 0 143 174
the 0 143 174
altar 0 143 174
- 0 143 174
by 0 143 174
the 0 143 174
attitude 0 143 174
of 0 143 174
the 0 143 174
priest. 0 143 174

They 0 143 175
know 0 143 175
that. 0 143 175

That 0 143 176
is 0 143 176
very 0 143 176
important. 0 143 176

But 0 143 177
the 0 143 177
change 0 143 177
in 0 143 177
the 0 143 177
Mass 0 143 177
destroys 1 143 177
the 1 143 177
Church. 1 143 177

Because 0 143 178
we 0 143 178
know 0 143 178
the 0 143 178
liturgy 0 143 178
teaches 0 143 178
us 0 143 178
hierarchy. 0 143 178

The 0 143 179
true 0 143 179
liturgy 0 143 179
is 0 143 179
hierarchical. 0 143 179

It 0 143 180
is 0 143 180
not 0 143 180
democratic 0 143 180
but 0 143 180
hierarchical. 1 143 180

Why? 0 143 181

Because 0 143 182
we 0 143 182
have 0 143 182
God, 0 143 182
the 0 143 182
priest, 0 143 182
and 0 143 182
then 0 143 182
the 0 143 182
people. 0 143 182

That 0 143 183
is 0 143 183
hierarchy. 0 143 183

When 0 143 184
we 0 143 184
are 0 143 184
in 0 143 184
Church 0 143 184
we 0 143 184
know 0 143 184
God 0 143 184
is 0 143 184
on 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
altar; 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
priest 0 143 184
is 0 143 184
between 0 143 184
God 0 143 184
and 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
people; 0 143 184
and 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
people 0 143 184
receive 0 143 184
God 0 143 184
at 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
hand 0 143 184
of 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
priest. 0 143 184

That 1 143 185
is 1 143 185
hierarchy. 1 143 185

But 0 143 186
now 0 143 186
the 0 143 186
new 0 143 186
liturgy 0 143 186
is 0 143 186
more 0 143 186
democratic 0 143 186
- 0 143 186
all 0 143 186
around 0 143 186
the 0 143 186
table. 0 143 186

The 0 143 187
priest 0 143 187
is 0 143 187
only 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
president, 0 143 187
and 0 143 187
sometimes 0 143 187
another 0 143 187
man 0 143 187
can 0 143 187
take 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
role 0 143 187
of 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
president 0 143 187
of 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
meal. 0 143 187

That 0 143 188
is 0 143 188
a 0 143 188
new 0 143 188
liturgy. 0 143 188

That 0 143 189
is 0 143 189
very 0 143 189
bad, 0 143 189
because 0 143 189
we 0 143 189
have 0 143 189
no 0 143 189
sense 0 143 189
of 0 143 189
the 0 143 189
hierarchical; 0 143 189
whereas 0 143 189
the 0 143 189
sense 0 143 189
of 0 143 189
hierarchy 0 143 189
is 0 143 189
very 0 143 189
important 0 143 189
in 0 143 189
our 0 143 189
life. 0 143 189

We 0 143 190
need 0 143 190
the 0 143 190
authority 0 143 190
of 0 143 190
God. 0 143 190

We 0 143 191
need 0 143 191
the 0 143 191
Real 0 143 191
Presence 0 143 191
of 0 143 191
God 0 143 191
on 0 143 191
our 0 143 191
altar. 0 143 191

We 0 143 192
need 0 143 192
the 0 143 192
Sacrifice 0 143 192
of 0 143 192
the 0 143 192
Mass 0 143 192
– 0 143 192
not 0 143 192
a 0 143 192
meal 0 143 192
only 0 143 192
– 0 143 192
but 0 143 192
the 0 143 192
Sacrifice. 0 143 192

So, 0 143 193
the 0 143 193
Victim 0 143 193
of 0 143 193
the 0 143 193
Sacrifice 0 143 193
is 0 143 193
really 0 143 193
present 0 143 193
on 0 143 193
our 0 143 193
altar. 0 143 193

That 0 143 194
is 0 143 194
the 0 143 194
school 0 143 194
of 0 143 194
our 0 143 194
Faith. 0 143 194

And 0 143 195
slowly, 0 143 195
slowly, 0 143 195
this 0 143 195
new 0 143 195
Mass 0 143 195
equivocates. 0 143 195

It 0 143 196
moves 0 143 196
the 0 143 196
minds 0 143 196
of 0 143 196
the 0 143 196
faithful 0 143 196
in 0 143 196
a 0 143 196
Protestant 0 143 196
[direction]. 0 143 196

I 0 143 197
do 0 143 197
not 0 143 197
say 0 143 197
that 0 143 197
all 0 143 197
[Novus 0 143 197
Ordo] 0 143 197
Masses 0 143 197
are 0 143 197
invalid. 0 143 197

I 1 143 198
do 1 143 198
not 1 143 198
say 1 143 198
that. 1 143 198

But 0 143 199
perhaps, 0 143 199
more 0 143 199
and 0 143 199
more, 0 143 199
they 0 143 199
become 0 143 199
invalid 0 143 199
because 0 143 199
[the 0 143 199
ministers 0 143 199
lose 0 143 199
faith 0 143 199
in 0 143 199
the 0 143 199
Real 0 143 199
Presence]. 0 143 199

Recently, 0 143 200
in 0 143 200
France, 0 143 200
a 0 143 200
progressive 0 143 200
paper 0 143 200
conducted 0 143 200
a 0 143 200
statistical 0 143 200
survey 0 143 200
to 0 143 200
see 0 143 200
how 0 143 200
many 0 143 200
priests 0 143 200
no 0 143 200
longer 0 143 200
have 0 143 200
faith 0 143 200
in 0 143 200
the 0 143 200
Real 0 143 200
Presence. 0 143 200

They 0 143 201
found 0 143 201
that 0 143 201
twenty-two 0 143 201
percent 0 143 201
no 0 143 201
longer 0 143 201
have 0 143 201
the 0 143 201
faith, 0 143 201
the 1 143 201
belief 1 143 201
in 0 143 201
the 0 143 201
Real 0 143 201
Presence. 0 143 201

But 0 143 202
I 0 143 202
think 0 143 202
that 0 143 202
if 0 143 202
they 0 143 202
directed 0 143 202
this 0 143 202
question 0 143 202
to 0 143 202
all 0 143 202
of 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
priests 0 143 202
who 0 143 202
are 0 143 202
under 0 143 202
50 0 143 202
years 0 143 202
of 0 143 202
age, 0 143 202
they 0 143 202
would 0 143 202
find 0 143 202
that 0 143 202
fifty 0 143 202
percent 0 143 202
[have 0 143 202
lost 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
faith 0 143 202
in 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
Real 0 143 202
Presence], 0 143 202
because 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
young 0 143 202
priests 0 143 202
have 0 143 202
no 0 143 202
faith. 0 143 202

No 1 143 203
faith. 1 143 203

Last 0 143 204
year, 0 143 204
Bishop 0 143 204
Adam 0 143 204
(in 0 143 204
our 0 143 204
Diocese 0 143 204
of 0 143 204
Sion, 0 143 204
Switzerland) 0 143 204
ordained 0 143 204
one 0 143 204
priest 0 143 204
for 0 143 204
my 0 143 204
Congregation 0 143 204
of 0 143 204
the 0 143 204
Holy 0 143 204
Ghost 0 143 204
Fathers. 0 143 204

This 0 143 205
one 0 143 205
priest 0 143 205
came 0 143 205
from 0 143 205
France. 0 143 205

His 0 143 206
uncle 0 143 206
had 0 143 206
died 0 143 206
in 0 143 206
a 0 143 206
road 0 143 206
accident 0 143 206
when 0 143 206
his 0 143 206
cab 0 143 206
fell 0 143 206
in 0 143 206
the 0 143 206
river. 0 143 206

The 0 143 207
uncle 0 143 207
had 0 143 207
nine 0 143 207
children. 0 143 207

The 0 143 208
Bishop 0 143 208
said 0 143 208
to 0 143 208
the 0 143 208
new 0 143 208
priest, 0 143 208
“Now 0 143 208
you 0 143 208
can 0 143 208
say 0 143 208
Mass 0 143 208
for 0 143 208
your 0 143 208
uncle. 0 143 208

Now 0 143 209
you 0 143 209
are 0 143 209
a 0 143 209
priest, 0 143 209
and 0 143 209
you 0 143 209
can 0 143 209
say 0 143 209
Mass 0 143 209
for 0 143 209
your 0 143 209
uncle.” 0 143 209
The 0 143 209
new 0 143 209
priest 0 143 209
said, 0 143 209
“No, 0 143 209
never.” 0 143 209
Why? 0 143 209

It 0 143 210
is 0 143 210
not 0 143 210
useful 0 143 210
to 0 143 210
say 0 143 210
Mass 0 143 210
for 0 143 210
the 0 143 210
dead? 0 143 210

“No, 0 143 211
no, 0 143 211
it 0 143 211
is 0 143 211
impossible. 0 143 211

They 0 143 212
are 0 143 212
already 0 143 212
in 0 143 212
heaven.” 0 143 212
This 0 143 212
young 0 143 212
priest 0 143 212
who 0 143 212
was 0 143 212
ordained 0 143 212
by 0 143 212
the 0 143 212
Bishop 0 143 212
last 0 143 212
year 0 143 212
for 0 143 212
my 0 143 212
Congregation 0 143 212
is 0 143 212
now 0 143 212
a 0 143 212
professor 0 143 212
in 0 143 212
the 0 143 212
minor 0 143 212
seminary 0 143 212
in 0 143 212
Switzerland. 0 143 212

They 0 143 213
are 0 143 213
not 0 143 213
learning 0 143 213
theology, 0 143 213
not 0 143 213
philosophy, 0 143 213
not 0 143 213
anything. 0 143 213

They 1 143 214
learn 1 143 214
nothing 1 143 214
now. 1 143 214

Another 0 143 215
example. 0 143 215

Recently, 0 143 216
I 0 143 216
had 0 143 216
two 0 143 216
young 0 143 216
[potential] 0 143 216
seminarians 0 143 216
come 0 143 216
to 0 143 216
my 0 143 216
house 0 143 216
near 0 143 216
Paris. 0 143 216

One 0 143 217
of 0 143 217
them 0 143 217
works 0 143 217
in 0 143 217
a 0 143 217
factory, 0 143 217
and 0 143 217
the 0 143 217
other 0 143 217
is 0 143 217
a 0 143 217
university 0 143 217
student. 0 143 217

They 0 143 218
told 0 143 218
me 0 143 218
they 0 143 218
were 0 143 218
[considering] 0 143 218
the 0 143 218
seminary 0 143 218
of 0 143 218
Paris. 0 143 218

I 0 143 219
asked 0 143 219
them, 0 143 219
“Why 0 143 219
do 0 143 219
you 0 143 219
come 0 143 219
to 0 143 219
see 0 143 219
me?” 0 143 219
They 0 143 219
told 0 143 219
me 0 143 219
that 0 143 219
they 0 143 219
had 0 143 219
a 0 143 219
meeting 0 143 219
in 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
house 0 143 219
of 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
Oblate 0 143 219
of 0 143 219
Maria 0 143 219
with 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
priest 0 143 219
who 0 143 219
oversees 0 143 219
young 0 143 219
men 0 143 219
who 0 143 219
may 0 143 219
have 0 143 219
vocations 0 143 219
to 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
priesthood 0 143 219
in 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
Diocese 0 143 219
of 0 143 219
Paris. 0 143 219

There 0 143 220
was 0 143 220
a 0 143 220
total 0 143 220
of 0 143 220
fifteen 0 143 220
young 0 143 220
men 0 143 220
for 0 143 220
all 0 143 220
of 0 143 220
the 0 143 220
Diocese 0 143 220
of 0 143 220
Paris. 0 143 220

During 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
meeting, 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
priest, 0 143 221
before 0 143 221
he 0 143 221
celebrated 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
Eucharist, 0 143 221
said, 0 143 221
“Today 0 143 221
we 0 143 221
celebrate 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
Eucharist, 0 143 221
but 0 143 221
we 0 143 221
do 0 143 221
not 0 143 221
believe 0 143 221
in 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
Real 0 143 221
Presence.” 0 143 221
These 0 143 221
two 0 143 221
young 0 143 221
men 0 143 221
said 0 143 221
“That 0 143 221
is 0 143 221
impossible. 1 143 221

We 0 143 222
cannot 0 143 222
remain 0 143 222
in 0 143 222
this 0 143 222
seminary.” 0 143 222
So, 0 143 222
they 0 143 222
came 0 143 222
to 0 143 222
meet 0 143 222
me. 0 143 222

They 0 143 223
said 0 143 223
that 0 143 223
Econe 0 143 223
is 0 143 223
the 0 143 223
only 0 143 223
seminary 0 143 223
where 0 143 223
they 0 143 223
seem 0 143 223
to 0 143 223
be 0 143 223
able 0 143 223
to 0 143 223
find 0 143 223
the 0 143 223
True 0 143 223
Faith. 0 143 223

They 0 143 224
asked 0 143 224
for 0 143 224
admittance 0 143 224
to 0 143 224
Econe. 0 143 224

And 0 143 225
I 0 143 225
think 0 143 225
that 0 143 225
they 0 143 225
shall 0 143 225
be 0 143 225
coming 0 143 225
to 0 143 225
Econe 0 143 225
next 0 143 225
October. 0 143 225

But 0 143 226
that 0 143 226
is 0 143 226
a 0 143 226
new 0 143 226
religion. 0 143 226

It 0 143 227
is 0 143 227
a 0 143 227
Protestant 0 143 227
religion. 0 143 227

That 1 143 228
is 1 143 228
a 1 143 228
fact. 1 143 228

Perhaps 0 143 229
you 0 143 229
can 0 143 229
say, 0 143 229
“How 1 143 229
is 1 143 229
it 1 143 229
possible 1 143 229
that 1 143 229
the 1 143 229
pope 1 143 229
gives 1 143 229
the 1 143 229
authorization 1 143 229
to 1 143 229
this 1 143 229
change? 1 143 229

How 1 143 230
is 1 143 230
it 1 143 230
possible 1 143 230
the 1 143 230
pope 1 143 230
signed 1 143 230
this 1 143 230
decree? 1 143 230

Signed 1 143 231
this 1 143 231
constitution?” 1 143 231
I 0 143 231
don’t 0 143 231
know. 0 143 231

I 1 143 232
don’t 1 143 232
know. 1 143 232

It 0 143 233
is 0 143 233
a 0 143 233
big 0 143 233
mystery. 0 143 233

A 1 143 234
big 1 143 234
mystery. 1 143 234

There 0 143 235
are 0 143 235
many 0 143 235
proposed 0 143 235
theological 0 143 235
answers. 0 143 235

I 0 143 236
cannot 0 143 236
subscribe 0 143 236
to 0 143 236
all 0 143 236
of 0 143 236
them. 0 143 236

Some 0 143 237
say 0 143 237
the 0 143 237
pope 0 143 237
is 0 143 237
not 0 143 237
responsible. 0 143 237

Perhaps 0 143 238
someone 0 143 238
gave 0 143 238
the 0 143 238
pope 0 143 238
an 0 143 238
injection, 0 143 238
a 0 143 238
drug, 0 143 238
and 0 143 238
he 0 143 238
is 0 143 238
not 0 143 238
responsible. 0 143 238

Perhaps, 0 143 239
I 0 143 239
don’t 0 143 239
know. 0 143 239

Some 0 143 240
say 0 143 240
there 0 143 240
are 0 143 240
two 0 143 240
popes 0 143 240
[(a 0 143 240
body 0 143 240
double)]. 0 143 240

I 1 143 241
don’t 1 143 241
know. 1 143 241

Some 0 143 242
say 0 143 242
the 0 143 242
pope 0 143 242
was 0 143 242
liberal 0 143 242
before 0 143 242
he 0 143 242
was 0 143 242
elected 0 143 242
pope, 0 143 242
and 0 143 242
perhaps 0 143 242
(we 0 143 242
do 0 143 242
not 0 143 242
know) 0 143 242
he 0 143 242
gave 0 143 242
his 0 143 242
name 0 143 242
to 0 143 242
Freemasonry 0 143 242
(thereby 0 143 242
incurring 0 143 242
excommunication 0 143 242
before 0 143 242
the 0 143 242
conclave). 0 143 242

We 0 143 243
do 0 143 243
not 0 143 243
know. 0 143 243

We 0 143 244
do 0 143 244
know 0 143 244
now 0 143 244
that 0 143 244
Bugnini 0 143 244
was 0 143 244
primarily 0 143 244
responsible 0 143 244
for 0 143 244
the 0 143 244
change 0 143 244
in 0 143 244
liturgy, 0 143 244
and 0 143 244
that 0 143 244
he 1 143 244
is 1 143 244
an 1 143 244
infamous 1 143 244
Freemason. 1 143 244

And 0 143 245
because 0 143 245
he 0 143 245
had 0 143 245
an 0 143 245
indiscretion 0 143 245
with 0 143 245
his 0 143 245
Masonic 0 143 245
appurtenances, 0 143 245
the 0 143 245
Pope 0 143 245
sent 0 143 245
him 0 143 245
as 0 143 245
a 0 143 245
Nuncio 0 143 245
in 0 143 245
Iran. 0 143 245

I 1 143 246
don’t 1 143 246
know. 1 143 246

We 1 143 247
don’t 1 143 247
know. 1 143 247

Now, 0 143 248
you 0 143 248
cannot 0 143 248
say 0 143 248
that 0 143 248
Archbishop 0 143 248
Lefebvre 0 143 248
said 0 143 248
the 0 143 248
pope 0 143 248
gave 0 143 248
his 0 143 248
name 0 143 248
to 0 143 248
Freemasonry. 0 143 248

No, 0 143 249
you 0 143 249
cannot 0 143 249
say 0 143 249
that. 0 143 249

It 0 143 250
is 0 143 250
possible, 0 143 250
but 0 143 250
we 1 143 250
do 1 143 250
not 1 143 250
know. 1 143 250

But 0 143 251
if 0 143 251
he 0 143 251
was 0 143 251
excommunicated, 0 143 251
then 0 143 251
he 0 143 251
is 0 143 251
not 0 143 251
pope. 0 143 251

Not 1 143 252
pope. 1 143 252

Illegitimate. 0 143 253

I 0 143 254
don’t 0 143 254
know. 0 143 254

It 0 143 255
is 0 143 255
a 0 143 255
mystery 0 143 255
I 0 143 255
cannot 0 143 255
understand. 0 143 255

But 0 143 256
the 0 143 256
fact 0 143 256
is 0 143 256
that 0 143 256
the 0 143 256
Catholic 0 143 256
Church 0 143 256
is 0 143 256
being 0 143 256
destroyed, 0 143 256
and 0 143 256
now 0 143 256
even 0 143 256
the 0 143 256
pope 0 143 256
himself 0 143 256
says 0 143 256
that. 0 143 256

This 0 143 257
pope 0 143 257
has 0 143 257
referred 0 143 257
to 0 143 257
the 0 143 257
auto-demolition 0 143 257
of 0 143 257
the 0 143 257
Church. 0 143 257

He 0 143 258
said, 0 143 258
“The 0 143 258
smoke 1 143 258
of 1 143 258
Satan 1 143 258
has 0 143 258
entered 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
Church.” 0 143 258
But 0 143 258
where 0 143 258
are 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
men 0 143 258
responsible 0 143 258
for 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
destruction 0 143 258
of 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
Church? 0 143 258

Well, 0 143 259
there 0 143 259
they 0 143 259
are. 0 143 259

They 0 143 260
are 0 143 260
the 0 143 260
men 0 143 260
who 0 143 260
destroy 0 143 260
the 0 143 260
Church. 0 143 260

We 0 143 261
must 0 143 261
show 0 143 261
where 0 143 261
they 0 143 261
are. 0 143 261

Where 0 143 262
is 0 143 262
this 0 143 262
smoke 1 143 262
of 1 143 262
Satan 1 143 262
that 0 143 262
has 0 143 262
entered 0 143 262
the 0 143 262
Church? 0 143 262

I 0 143 263
do 0 143 263
not 0 143 263
know, 0 143 263
but 0 143 263
it 0 143 263
is 0 143 263
the 0 143 263
pope 0 143 263
himself 0 143 263
who 0 143 263
said 0 143 263
that. 0 143 263

And 0 143 264
I 0 143 264
have 0 143 264
these 0 143 264
experiences 0 143 264
every 0 143 264
day. 0 143 264

I 0 143 265
visit 0 143 265
many 0 143 265
countries. 0 143 265

I 0 143 266
was 0 143 266
in 0 143 266
Spain 0 143 266
during 0 143 266
the 0 143 266
Christmas 0 143 266
Holy 0 143 266
Days. 0 143 266

Then 0 143 267
I 0 143 267
was 0 143 267
in 0 143 267
Bonn, 0 143 267
near 0 143 267
Cologne, 0 143 267
Germany, 0 143 267
three 0 143 267
weeks 0 143 267
ago, 0 143 267
to 0 143 267
speak 0 143 267
at 0 143 267
a 0 143 267
conference. 0 143 267

Many 0 143 268
people 0 143 268
came. 0 143 268

Many 0 143 269
people 0 143 269
are 0 143 269
confused. 0 143 269

What 0 143 270
is 0 143 270
happening 0 143 270
in 0 143 270
the 0 143 270
Church? 0 143 270

They 0 143 271
are 0 143 271
anxious. 0 143 271

But 0 143 272
many 0 143 272
people 0 143 272
say 0 143 272
that 0 143 272
we 0 143 272
disobey. 0 143 272

Disobey? 0 143 273

Obedience 0 143 274
is 0 143 274
relative. 0 143 274

It 0 143 275
is 0 143 275
not 0 143 275
absolute. 0 143 275

It 0 143 276
is 0 143 276
relative 0 143 276
to 0 143 276
the 0 143 276
good, 0 143 276
but 0 143 276
not 0 143 276
to 0 143 276
the 0 143 276
evil. 0 143 276

We 0 143 277
cannot 0 143 277
obey 0 143 277
our 0 143 277
parents 0 143 277
if 0 143 277
they 0 143 277
command 0 143 277
a 0 143 277
bad 0 143 277
thing. 0 143 277

We 0 143 278
cannot 0 143 278
obey. 0 143 278

It 0 143 279
is 0 143 279
clear. 0 143 279

And 0 143 280
I 0 143 280
know 0 143 280
that 0 143 280
in 0 143 280
Spain, 0 143 280
for 0 143 280
example, 0 143 280
the 0 143 280
situation 0 143 280
in 0 143 280
the 0 143 280
Church 0 143 280
is 0 143 280
very 0 143 280
bad. 0 143 280

The 0 143 281
new 0 143 281
nominees 0 143 281
of 0 143 281
bishops 0 143 281
and 0 143 281
many 0 143 281
auxiliary 0 143 281
bishops 0 143 281
are, 0 143 281
approximately, 0 143 281
communist, 0 143 281
Marxist, 0 143 281
and 0 143 281
socialist. 0 143 281

And 0 143 282
so, 0 143 282
a 0 143 282
majority 0 143 282
of 0 143 282
the 0 143 282
bishops 0 143 282
in 0 143 282
the 0 143 282
Episcopal 0 143 282
Conference 0 143 282
of 0 143 282
Spain 0 143 282
are 0 143 282
progressives. 0 143 282

They 0 143 283
are 0 143 283
modernists. 0 143 283

Whereas, 0 143 284
the 0 143 284
majority 0 143 284
of 0 143 284
the 0 143 284
bishops 0 143 284
[from 0 143 284
Spain] 0 143 284
during 0 143 284
the 0 143 284
Council 0 143 284
were 0 143 284
conservative. 0 143 284

So, 0 143 285
Rome 0 143 285
is 0 143 285
responsible 0 143 285
[for 0 143 285
the 0 143 285
situation 0 143 285
of 0 143 285
the 0 143 285
Church 0 143 285
in 0 143 285
Spain] 0 143 285
because 0 143 285
it 0 143 285
is 0 143 285
Rome 0 143 285
who 0 143 285
approves 0 143 285
the 0 143 285
nominations 0 143 285
for 0 143 285
bishops. 0 143 285

And 0 143 286
we 0 143 286
know 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
France, 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
Germany, 0 143 286
and 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
Europe 0 143 286
generally, 0 143 286
that 0 143 286
all 0 143 286
of 0 143 286
the 0 143 286
young 0 143 286
bishops 0 143 286
are 0 143 286
worse 0 143 286
[than 0 143 286
the 0 143 286
bishops 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
Spain] 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
that 0 143 286
they 0 143 286
are 0 143 286
more 0 143 286
or 0 143 286
less 0 143 286
Marxist. 0 143 286

That 0 143 287
is 0 143 287
a 0 143 287
fact. 0 143 287

That 0 143 288
is 0 143 288
impossible. 0 143 288

How 0 143 289
can 0 143 289
they 0 143 289
do 0 143 289
that? 0 143 289

I 0 143 290
do 0 143 290
not 0 143 290
know. 0 143 290

I 1 143 291
do 1 143 291
not 1 143 291
know. 1 143 291

I 0 143 292
have 0 143 292
not 0 143 292
spent 0 143 292
my 0 143 292
whole 0 143 292
life 0 143 292
in 0 143 292
Rome. 0 143 292

I 0 143 293
do 0 143 293
know 0 143 293
Rome 0 143 293
very 0 143 293
well, 0 143 293
because 0 143 293
I 0 143 293
was 0 143 293
an 0 143 293
apostolic 0 143 293
delegate, 0 143 293
and 0 143 293
I 0 143 293
was 0 143 293
in 0 143 293
the 0 143 293
Secretariate 0 143 293
of 0 143 293
the 0 143 293
Secretary 0 143 293
of 0 143 293
State. 0 143 293

And 0 143 294
I 0 143 294
know 0 143 294
that 0 143 294
very 0 143 294
well. 0 143 294

But 0 143 295
I 0 143 295
think 0 143 295
that 0 143 295
the 1 143 295
devil 1 143 295
is 1 143 295
in 1 143 295
Rome, 1 143 295
as 0 143 295
was 0 143 295
said 0 143 295

our 0 143 295
Lady 0 143 295
of 0 143 295
Fatima 0 143 295
and 0 143 295
Our 0 143 295
Lady 0 143 295
of 0 143 295
La 0 143 295
Salette. 0 143 295

We 0 143 296
must 0 143 296
pray. 0 143 296

We 0 143 297
must 0 143 297
ask 0 143 297
God 0 143 297
to 0 143 297
put 0 143 297
an 0 143 297
end 0 143 297
to 0 143 297
this 0 143 297
crisis 0 143 297
of 0 143 297
the 0 143 297
Church. 0 143 297

Because 1 143 298
if 1 143 298
this 1 143 298
crisis 1 143 298
continues, 1 143 298
many 1 143 298
people 1 143 298
will 1 143 298
go 1 143 298
to 1 143 298
hell. 1 143 298

They 0 143 299
lose 0 143 299
the 0 143 299
faith. 0 143 299

They 0 143 300
cannot 0 143 300
go 0 143 300
into 0 143 300
the 0 143 300
church. 0 143 300

They 0 143 301
abandon 0 143 301
the 0 143 301
faith. 0 143 301

You 0 143 302
know 0 143 302
that 0 143 302
many 0 143 302
priests 0 143 302
have 0 143 302
abandoned 0 143 302
the 0 143 302
faith. 0 143 302

Many 0 143 303
priests 0 143 303
have 0 143 303
gotten 0 143 303
married. 0 143 303

And 0 143 304
many 0 143 304
sisters 0 143 304
have 0 143 304
abandoned 0 143 304
their 0 143 304
congregations. 0 143 304

It 0 143 305
is 0 143 305
a 0 143 305
pity. 0 143 305

And 0 143 306
it 0 143 306
is 0 143 306
everywhere. 0 143 306

I 0 143 307
was 0 143 307
in 0 143 307
Melbourne, 0 143 307
Australia, 0 143 307
during 0 143 307
the 0 143 307
40th 0 143 307
International 0 143 307
Eucharistic 0 143 307

Cardinal 0 143 308
Knox, 0 143 308
who 0 143 308
was 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
man 0 143 308
responsible 0 143 308
for 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
Eucharistic 0 143 308
Congress, 0 143 308
is 0 143 308
now 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
Prefect 0 143 308
of 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
Congregation 0 143 308
for 0 143 308
Divine 0 143 308
Worship. 0 143 308

I 0 143 309
read 0 143 309
in 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
newspaper 0 143 309
about 0 143 309
a 0 143 309
Mass 0 143 309
Cardinal 0 143 309
Knox 0 143 309
celebrated 0 143 309
during 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
Eucharistic 0 143 309
Congress 0 143 309
where 0 143 309
sensual 1 143 309
dancing 1 143 309
was 0 143 309
performed 0 143 309
at 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
same 0 143 309
time 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
words 0 143 309
of 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
Consecration 0 143 309
were 0 143 309
pronounced. 0 143 309

That 0 143 310
is 0 143 310
a 0 143 310
sacrilege. 1 143 310

You 0 143 311
cannot 0 143 311
go 0 143 311
to 0 143 311
that 0 143 311
Mass. 0 143 311

That 1 143 312
is 1 143 312
sacrilege. 1 143 312

This 0 143 313
is 0 143 313
a 0 143 313
fact. 0 143 313

They 0 143 314
also 0 143 314
called 0 143 314
me 0 143 314
by 0 143 314
phone 0 143 314
in 0 143 314
Melbourne 0 143 314
to 0 143 314
say 0 143 314
I 0 143 314
was 0 143 314
on 0 143 314
the 0 143 314
list 0 143 314
of 0 143 314
the 0 143 314
bishops 0 143 314
[attending] 0 143 314
the 0 143 314
Eucharistic 0 143 314
Congress. 0 143 314

They 0 143 315
asked 0 143 315
me 0 143 315
to 0 143 315
concelebrate 0 143 315
Mass 0 143 315
with 0 143 315
a 0 143 315
Protestant 0 143 315
pastor 0 143 315
and 0 143 315
a 0 143 315
rabbi. 0 143 315

Ay. 1 143 316

Impossible. 1 143 317

Impossible. 1 143 318

No, 1 143 319
no, 1 143 319
no, 1 143 319
no. 1 143 319

[applause] 0 143 320

This 0 143 321
change 0 143 321
is 0 143 321
not 0 143 321
accidental. 0 143 321

It 0 143 322
is 0 143 322
not 0 143 322
superficial. 0 143 322

It 0 143 323
is 0 143 323
very 0 143 323
deep. 0 143 323

Very 0 143 324
bad. 0 143 324

It 0 143 325
is 0 143 325
against 0 143 325
our 0 143 325
faith. 0 143 325

Against 1 143 326
our 1 143 326
faith. 1 143 326

And 0 143 327
so, 0 143 327
we 0 143 327
cannot 0 143 327
accept 0 143 327
this 0 143 327
Council 0 143 327
and 0 143 327
this 0 143 327
reform 0 143 327
and 0 143 327
this 0 143 327
orientation 0 143 327
even 0 143 327
though 0 143 327
it 0 143 327
comes 0 143 327
from 0 143 327
Rome. 0 143 327

From 0 143 328
Rome 0 143 328
we 0 143 328
expect 0 143 328
only 0 143 328
the 0 143 328
good. 0 143 328

We 0 143 329
do 0 143 329
not 0 143 329
expect 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
bad, 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
ill. 0 143 329
We 0 143 329
do 0 143 329
not 0 143 329
expect 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
abandonment 0 143 329
of 0 143 329
adoration 0 143 329
in 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
Mass. 0 143 329

We 0 143 330
need 0 143 330
this 0 143 330
adoration. 0 143 330

We 0 143 331
need 0 143 331
to 0 143 331
have 0 143 331
the 0 143 331
faith 0 143 331
in 0 143 331
the 0 143 331
divinity 0 143 331
of 0 143 331
Jesus 0 143 331
Christ. 0 143 331

Because 0 143 332
all 0 143 332
[of 0 143 332
this 0 143 332
change] 0 143 332
is 0 143 332
[oriented] 0 143 332
against 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
divinity 0 143 332
of 0 143 332
Jesus 0 143 332
Christ, 0 143 332
against 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
Kingdom 0 143 332
of 0 143 332
Jesus 0 143 332
Christ, 0 143 332
against 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
Real 0 143 332
Presence 0 143 332
of 0 143 332
Jesus 0 143 332
Christ 0 143 332
in 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
Mass. 0 143 332

It 0 143 333
is 0 143 333
a 0 143 333
sin 0 143 333
when 0 143 333
we 0 143 333
abandon 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
truth 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
Kingdom 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
Jesus 0 143 333
Christ, 0 143 333
everywhere, 0 143 333
and 0 143 333
we 0 143 333
abandon 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
Faith 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
divinity 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
Jesus 0 143 333
Christ. 0 143 333

He 0 143 334
is 0 143 334
King 0 143 334
because 0 143 334
he 0 143 334
is 0 143 334
God. 0 143 334

He 0 143 335
is 0 143 335
the 0 143 335
Son 0 143 335
of 0 143 335
God. 0 143 335

So, 0 143 336
He 0 143 336
is 0 143 336
King 0 143 336
by 0 143 336
His 0 143 336
nature. 0 143 336

This 0 143 337
is 0 143 337
essential. 0 143 337

Essential! 1 143 338

And 1 143 339
if 1 143 339
He 1 143 339
is 1 143 339
God, 1 143 339
we 1 143 339
must 1 143 339
give 1 143 339
Him 1 143 339
the 1 143 339
adoration 1 143 339
of 1 143 339
God. 1 143 339

And 0 143 340
so, 0 143 340
we 0 143 340
cannot 0 143 340
accept 0 143 340
the 0 143 340
diminution 0 143 340
of 0 143 340
this 0 143 340
Truth. 0 143 340

Jesus 0 143 341
Christ 0 143 341
is 0 143 341
the 0 143 341
Son 0 143 341
of 0 143 341
God. 0 143 341

Jesus 0 143 342
Christ 0 143 342
is 0 143 342
God. 0 143 342

That 0 143 343
is 0 143 343
a 0 143 343
fundamental 0 143 343
truth 0 143 343
of 0 143 343
our 0 143 343
Faith. 0 143 343

And 0 143 344
it 0 143 344
all 0 143 344
depends 0 143 344
on 0 143 344
this 0 143 344
Truth. 0 143 344

And 0 143 345
we 0 143 345
know 0 143 345
now 0 143 345
that 0 143 345
the 0 143 345
theologians 0 143 345
and 0 143 345
the 0 143 345
bishops 0 143 345
have 0 143 345
[a 0 143 345
new 0 143 345
orientation]. 0 143 345

They 0 143 346
do 0 143 346
not 0 143 346
express 0 143 346
this 0 143 346
truth 0 143 346
clearly 0 143 346
and 0 143 346
perfectly. 0 143 346

They 0 143 347
are 0 143 347
afraid 0 143 347
of 0 143 347
the 0 143 347
truth. 0 143 347

That 0 143 348
is 0 143 348
very 0 143 348
bad. 0 143 348

And 0 143 349
it 0 143 349
is 0 143 349
the 0 143 349
same 0 143 349
in 0 143 349
Rome. 0 143 349

I 0 143 350
think 0 143 350
they 0 143 350
refuse 0 143 350
[to 0 143 350
grant 0 143 350
me 0 143 350
an 0 143 350
audience 0 143 350
with] 0 143 350
the 0 143 350
pope, 0 143 350
[because 0 143 350
they 0 143 350
are 0 143 350
afraid 0 143 350
of 0 143 350
the 0 143 350
Truth]. 0 143 350

When 0 143 351
I 0 143 351
was 0 143 351
in 0 143 351
Rome 0 143 351
one 0 143 351
month 0 143 351
ago, 0 143 351
Mgr. 0 143 351

Benelli 0 143 352
told 0 143 352
me 0 143 352
he 0 143 352
visits 0 143 352
the 0 143 352
pope 0 143 352
every 0 143 352
day. 0 143 352

He 0 143 353
said 0 143 353
that 0 143 353
when 0 143 353
he 0 143 353
left 0 143 353
me, 0 143 353
he 0 143 353
would 0 143 353
go 0 143 353
immediately 0 143 353
to 0 143 353
the 0 143 353
pope 0 143 353
to 0 143 353
express 0 143 353
the 0 143 353
importance 0 143 353
of 0 143 353
the 0 143 353
work 0 143 353
we 0 143 353
had 0 143 353
conducted 0 143 353
during 0 143 353
our 0 143 353
meeting. 0 143 353

Immediately, 0 143 354
he 0 143 354
said, 0 143 354
he 0 143 354
would 0 143 354
be 0 143 354
going. 0 143 354

So, 0 143 355
why 0 143 355
do 0 143 355
they 0 143 355
not 0 143 355
grant 0 143 355
me 0 143 355
the 0 143 355
possibility 0 143 355
of 0 143 355
visiting 0 143 355
the 0 143 355
pope? 0 143 355

Because 0 143 356
they 0 143 356
are 0 143 356
afraid. 0 143 356

Meanwhile 0 143 357
the 0 143 357
Vatican 0 143 357
operated 0 143 357
a 0 143 357
veritable 0 143 357
swinging 0 143 357
door 0 143 357
where 0 143 357
actual 0 143 357
heretics 0 143 357
and 0 143 357
schismatics 0 143 357
were 0 143 357
concerned. 0 143 357

Here, 0 143 358
again, 0 143 358
is 0 143 358
Blessed 0 143 358
Paul 0 143 358
VI, 0 143 358
famously 0 143 358
meeting 0 143 358
for 0 143 358
the 0 143 358
first 0 143 358
time 0 143 358
ever 0 143 358
with 0 143 358
the 0 143 358
heretic 0 143 358
Archbishop 0 143 358
of 0 143 358
Canterbury 0 143 358
in 0 143 358
St. 0 143 358
Peter's: 0 143 358

Cardinal 0 143 359
Villot 0 143 359
said, 0 143 359
“We 0 143 359
are 0 143 359
afraid 0 143 359
if 0 143 359
Msgr. 0 143 359

Lefebvre 0 143 360
meets 0 143 360
and 0 143 360
speaks 0 143 360
with 0 143 360
the 0 143 360
pope 0 143 360
that 0 143 360
perhaps 0 143 360
the 0 143 360
pope 0 143 360
will 0 143 360
change 0 143 360
his 0 143 360
mind.” 0 143 360
Because 0 143 360
[the 0 143 360
pope] 0 143 360
is 0 143 360
not 0 143 360
too 0 143 360
sure; 0 143 360
the 1 143 360
pope 1 143 360
is 1 143 360
not 1 143 360
man 1 143 360
of 1 143 360
true 1 143 360
conviction. 1 143 360

He 0 143 361
is 0 143 361
a 0 143 361
mysterious 0 143 361
man. 0 143 361

We 0 143 362
cannot 0 143 362
give 0 143 362
a 0 143 362
definition 0 143 362
of 0 143 362
the 0 143 362
man. 0 143 362

He 0 143 363
expresses 0 143 363
the 0 143 363
truth, 0 143 363
and 0 143 363
then 0 143 363
he 0 143 363
does 0 143 363
the 0 143 363
contrary/opposite. 0 143 363

Some 0 143 364
part 0 143 364
of 0 143 364
him 0 143 364
will 0 143 364
speak 0 143 364
the 0 143 364
truth. 0 143 364

Another 0 143 365
part 0 143 365
of 0 143 365
him 0 143 365
is 0 143 365
open 0 143 365
to 0 143 365
error. 0 143 365

Very 0 143 366
curious. 0 143 366

And 0 143 367
they 0 143 367
are 0 143 367
afraid 0 143 367
that 0 143 367
if 0 143 367
I 0 143 367
reveal 0 143 367
the 0 143 367
truth 0 143 367
[and 0 143 367
tell 0 143 367
the 0 143 367
Pope] 0 143 367
“you 0 143 367
must 0 143 367
affirm 0 143 367
the 0 143 367
Kingdom 0 143 367
of 0 143 367
Jesus 0 143 367
Christ 0 143 367
everywhere 0 143 367
and 0 143 367
always 0 143 367
each 0 143 367
day. 0 143 367

You 0 143 368
must 0 143 368
affirm 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Real 0 143 368
Presence 0 143 368
in 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Mass 0 143 368
- 0 143 368
in 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Sacrifice 0 143 368
of 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Mass,” 0 143 368
then 0 143 368
perhaps 0 143 368
it 0 143 368
is 0 143 368
possible 0 143 368
that 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Pope 0 143 368
will 0 143 368
change 0 143 368
his 0 143 368
mind. 0 143 368

And 0 143 369
so, 0 143 369
Cardinal 0 143 369
Villot 0 143 369
says, 0 143 369
there 0 143 369
is 0 143 369
a 0 143 369
confusion, 0 143 369
and 0 143 369
they 0 143 369
do 0 143 369
not 0 143 369
want 0 143 369
me 0 143 369
to 0 143 369
visit 0 143 369
the 0 143 369
pope. 0 143 369

It 0 143 370
is 0 143 370
impossible 0 143 370
to 0 143 370
admit 0 143 370
me. 0 143 370

And 0 143 371
I 0 143 371
know 0 143 371
the 0 143 371
pope 0 143 371
very 0 143 371
well! 0 143 371

When 0 143 372
I 0 143 372
was 0 143 372
the 0 143 372
apostolic 0 143 372
delegate 0 143 372
to 0 143 372
Pius 0 143 372
XII, 0 143 372
I 0 143 372
was 0 143 372
going 0 143 372
to 0 143 372
Rome 0 143 372
every 0 143 372
year. 0 143 372

And 0 143 373
during 0 143 373
those 0 143 373
eleven 0 143 373
years, 0 143 373
I 0 143 373
met 0 143 373
Msgr. 0 143 373

Montini. 0 143 374

I 1 143 375
know 1 143 375
him 1 143 375
very 1 143 375
well. 1 143 375

He 0 143 376
received 0 143 376
me 0 143 376
twice 0 143 376
during 0 143 376
the 0 143 376
Council, 0 143 376
for 0 143 376
a 0 143 376
private 0 143 376
audience 0 143 376
with 0 143 376
the 0 143 376
pope. 0 143 376

But, 0 143 377
now, 0 143 377
with 0 143 377
my 0 143 377
position 0 143 377
against 0 143 377
the 0 143 377
Council 0 143 377
and 0 143 377
the 0 143 377
reforms, 0 143 377
he 0 143 377
says: 0 143 377
“No, 0 143 377
impossible! 0 143 377

You 0 143 378
must 0 143 378
sign 0 143 378
in 0 143 378
writing 0 143 378
that 0 143 378
you 0 143 378
[accept] 0 143 378
the 0 143 378
Council 0 143 378
and 0 143 378
all 0 143 378
the 0 143 378
reforms 0 143 378
before 0 143 378
I 0 143 378
will 0 143 378
receive 0 143 378
you 0 143 378
in 0 143 378
audience.” 0 143 378
But 0 143 378
I 0 143 378
cannot 0 143 378
do 0 143 378
that. 0 143 378

For 0 143 379
me, 0 143 379
if 1 143 379
I 1 143 379
do 1 143 379
that, 1 143 379
then 1 143 379
I 1 143 379
betray 1 143 379
my 1 143 379
mother, 1 143 379
the 1 143 379
Church. 1 143 379

The 1 143 380
Church! 1 143 380

So, 0 143 381
I 0 143 381
thank 0 143 381
you 0 143 381
very 0 143 381
much 0 143 381
for 0 143 381
your 0 143 381
encouragement, 0 143 381
and 0 143 381
I 0 143 381
must 0 143 381
say 0 143 381
that 0 143 381
we 0 143 381
have 0 143 381
a 0 143 381
very 0 143 381
good 0 143 381
generation 0 143 381
of 0 143 381
young 0 143 381
men 0 143 381
and 0 143 381
good 0 143 381
vocations. 0 143 381

For 0 143 382
the 0 143 382
coming 0 143 382
year 0 143 382
we 0 143 382
have 0 143 382
59 0 143 382
applications 0 143 382
to 0 143 382
our 0 143 382
seminary 0 143 382
in 0 143 382
Econe, 0 143 382
Switzerland 0 143 382
– 0 143 382
applications 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
the 0 143 382
United 0 143 382
States, 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
England, 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
Germany, 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
France, 0 143 382
and 0 143 382
Spain. 0 143 382

Good 0 143 383
young 0 143 383
men 0 143 383
with 0 143 383
good 0 143 383
dispositions 0 143 383
are 0 143 383
coming 0 143 383
from 0 143 383
everywhere. 0 143 383

And 0 143 384
why? 0 143 384

Why 0 143 385
do 0 143 385
they 0 143 385
come 0 143 385
to 0 143 385
this 0 143 385
seminary 0 143 385
when 0 143 385
they 0 143 385
know 0 143 385
we 0 143 385
are 0 143 385
in 0 143 385
difficulties 0 143 385
with 0 143 385
Rome? 0 143 385

They 0 143 386
know 0 143 386
that. 0 143 386

But 0 143 387
still 0 143 387
they 0 143 387
come. 0 143 387

I 0 143 388
ask 0 143 388
them, 0 143 388
why 0 143 388
do 0 143 388
you 0 143 388
come 0 143 388
to 0 143 388
Econe? 0 143 388

You 0 143 389
know 0 143 389
our 0 143 389
situation. 0 143 389

They 0 143 390
say, 0 143 390
“Yes, 0 143 390
we 0 143 390
know 0 143 390
your 0 143 390
situation, 0 143 390
but 0 143 390
we 0 143 390
want 0 143 390
to 0 143 390
become 0 143 390
true 0 143 390
priests 0 143 390
and 0 143 390
not 0 143 390
protestant 0 143 390
pastors 0 143 390
or 0 143 390
modernist 0 143 390
priests. 0 143 390

We 0 143 391
are 0 143 391
coming 0 143 391
to 0 143 391
your 0 143 391
seminary 0 143 391
because 0 143 391
we 0 143 391
know 0 143 391
that 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
end 0 143 391
of 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
priest 0 143 391
is 0 143 391
to 0 143 391
offer 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
true 0 143 391
Sacrifice 0 143 391
of 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
Mass. 0 143 391

And 0 143 392
so, 0 143 392
we 0 143 392
are 0 143 392
Coming 0 143 392
to 0 143 392
Econe.” 0 143 392

And 0 143 393
as 0 143 393
I 0 143 393
have 0 143 393
visited 0 143 393
my 0 143 393
seminary 0 143 393
here 0 143 393
in 0 143 393
Armada 0 143 393
for 0 143 393
the 0 143 393
past 0 143 393
five 0 143 393
days, 0 143 393
I 0 143 393
can 0 143 393
see 0 143 393
it 0 143 393
is 0 143 393
the 0 143 393
same 0 143 393
here. 0 143 393

We 0 143 394
have 0 143 394
very 0 143 394
good 0 143 394
young 0 143 394
men. 0 143 394

I 0 143 395
also 0 143 395
have 0 143 395
some 0 143 395
Americans 0 143 395
in 0 143 395
my 0 143 395
seminary 0 143 395
in 0 143 395
Econe. 0 143 395

In 0 143 396
six 0 143 396
weeks 0 143 396
I 0 143 396
will 0 143 396
ordain 0 143 396
one 0 143 396
American 0 143 396
priest 0 143 396
from 0 143 396
Detroit, 0 143 396
who 0 143 396
is 0 143 396
a 0 143 396
very 0 143 396
good 0 143 396
seminarian 0 143 396
and 0 143 396
will 0 143 396
be 0 143 396
a 0 143 396
good 0 143 396
priest. 0 143 396

But 0 143 397
these 0 143 397
young 0 143 397
men 0 143 397
refuse 0 143 397
to 0 143 397
become 0 143 397
protestants. 0 143 397

They 0 143 398
refuse 0 143 398
to 0 143 398
become 0 143 398
modernist. 0 143 398

They 0 143 399
ask 0 143 399
to 0 143 399
become 0 143 399
true 0 143 399
priests. 0 143 399

And 0 143 400
it 0 143 400
is 0 143 400
a 0 143 400
pity 0 143 400
there 0 143 400
are 0 143 400
not 0 143 400
100 0 143 400
bishops 0 143 400
opening 0 143 400
good 0 143 400
seminaries. 0 143 400

So, 0 143 401
I 0 143 401
ask 0 143 401
you 0 143 401
to 0 143 401
pray 0 143 401
for 0 143 401
these 0 143 401
seminarians 0 143 401
because 0 143 401
when 0 143 401
they 0 143 401
become 0 143 401
priests 0 143 401
they 0 143 401
will 0 143 401
have 0 143 401
many 0 143 401
worries 0 143 401
and 0 143 401
many 0 143 401
difficulties. 0 143 401

I 0 143 402
think, 0 143 402
however, 0 143 402
they 0 143 402
are 0 143 402
very 0 143 402
well 0 143 402
prepared 0 143 402
to 0 143 402
deal 0 143 402
with 0 143 402
these 0 143 402
difficulties 0 143 402
and 0 143 402
worries. 0 143 402

And 0 143 403
we 0 143 403
have 0 143 403
confidence 0 143 403
in 0 143 403
God. 0 143 403

Since 0 143 404
I 0 143 404
began 0 143 404
this 0 143 404
work 0 143 404
six 0 143 404
years 0 143 404
ago, 0 143 404
now, 0 143 404
I 0 143 404
have 0 143 404
evidence 0 143 404
that 0 143 404
God 0 143 404
is 0 143 404
assisting 0 143 404
us. 0 143 404

Because 0 143 405
it 0 143 405
is 0 143 405
impossible, 0 143 405
I 0 143 405
realize, 0 143 405
to 0 143 405
do 0 143 405
this 0 143 405
by 0 143 405
myself. 0 143 405

We 0 143 406
now 0 143 406
have 0 143 406
houses 0 143 406
in 0 143 406
Switzerland 0 143 406
(3), 0 143 406
Munich, 0 143 406
France 0 143 406
(6), 0 143 406
Brussels 0 143 406
(1), 0 143 406
England, 0 143 406
Armada, 0 143 406
San 0 143 406
Francisco, 0 143 406
and 0 143 406
New 0 143 406
York. 0 143 406

In 0 143 407
Albano, 0 143 407
near 0 143 407
Rome, 0 143 407
we 0 143 407
have 0 143 407
a 0 143 407
congregation 0 143 407
of 0 143 407
sisters 0 143 407
where 0 143 407
I 0 143 407
have 0 143 407
five 0 143 407
vocations 0 143 407
from 0 143 407
the 0 143 407
states 0 143 407
(good 0 143 407
sisters). 0 143 407

And 0 143 408
I 0 143 408
am 0 143 408
building 0 143 408
a 0 143 408
seminary 0 143 408
in 0 143 408
Switzerland. 0 143 408

It 1 143 409
is 1 143 409
impossible 1 143 409
to 1 143 409
do 1 143 409
all 1 143 409
this 1 143 409
without 1 143 409
God’s 1 143 409
assistance. 1 143 409

So, 0 143 410
I 0 143 410
have 0 143 410
confidence. 0 143 410

It 0 143 411
is 0 143 411
impossible 0 143 411

the 0 67 25
FBI 0 67 25
of 0 67 25
the 0 67 25

He 0 67 26

in 0 67 26
his 0 67 26

that 0 67 26

that 0 67 26
any 0 67 26

mentioned. 0 67 26

I 0 67 27

not 0 67 27

occasionally 0 67 27
they 0 67 27
speak 0 67 27
of 0 67 27
it 0 67 27
and 0 67 27
always 0 67 27
in 0 67 27
a 0 67 27
guarded 0 67 27
manner.” 0 67 27
In 0 67 27
the 0 67 27

he 0 67 27
informed 0 67 27
the 0 67 27

that 0 67 27
“occasionally 0 67 27

after 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
fact.” 0 67 27
And 0 67 27
when 0 67 27
he 0 67 27
asked 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
Russians 0 67 27
about 0 67 27
these 0 67 27

he 0 67 27
stated 0 67 27
that 0 67 27
they 0 67 27
“occasionally 0 67 27

i.e. 0 67 27

equipment, 0 67 28
consulting. 0 67 28

I 0 67 29
asked 0 67 29
Vadim 0 67 29
(Mikerin) 0 67 29
if 0 67 29
they 0 67 29
felt 0 67 29
there 0 67 29
was 0 67 29
a 0 67 29
serious 0 67 29
problem, 0 67 29

would 0 67 29
they 0 67 29
adhere 0 67 29
to 0 67 29
sanctions 0 67 29
and 0 67 29
western 0 67 29
opinion. 0 67 29

His 0 67 30
response 0 67 30
was 0 67 30
a 0 67 30
smile 0 67 30
and 0 67 30
shoulder 0 67 30
shrug.” 0 67 30
But 0 67 30
Campbell 0 67 30
had 0 67 30
provided 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
FBI 0 67 30
with 0 67 30
evidence 0 67 30
of 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
criminal 0 67 30
network 0 67 30
and 0 67 30
delivered 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
information 0 67 30
to 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
FBI, 0 67 30
which 0 67 30
was 0 67 30
monitoring 0 67 30
his 0 67 30
work 0 67 30
as 0 67 30
an 0 67 30
informant 0 67 30
and 0 67 30
approving 0 67 30
his 0 67 30
transfer 0 67 30
of 0 67 30
bribery 0 67 30
money 0 67 30
to 0 67 30
the 0 67 30
Russians. 0 67 30

Those 0 67 31
transfers, 0 67 31
which 0 67 31
were 0 67 31
made 0 67 31
in 0 67 31
bulk 0 67 31
$50,000 0 67 31
sums 0 67 31
and 0 67 31
at 0 67 31
times 0 67 31
delivered 0 67 31
in 0 67 31
cash, 0 67 31
occurred 0 67 31
between 0 67 31
senior 0 67 31

the 0 67 31
Russian 0 67 31
executives 0 67 31
connected 0 67 31
to 0 67 31
Rosatom. 0 67 31

He 0 67 32
had 0 67 32
given 0 67 32
the 0 67 32
FBI 0 67 32
irrefutable 0 67 32
evidence 0 67 32
showing 0 67 32
how 0 67 32
contracts 0 67 32
obtained 0 67 32
from 0 67 32
the 0 67 32
same 0 67 32

bribery 0 67 32
and 0 67 32
other 0 67 32
nefarious 0 67 32
actions, 0 67 32
he 0 67 32
said. 0 67 32

Senior 0 67 33
members 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
the 0 67 33
FBI, 0 67 33
Department 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
Treasury, 0 67 33
Department 0 67 33

Energy 0 67 33
and 0 67 33
Department 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
Justice 0 67 33
were 0 67 33
also 0 67 33
briefed 0 67 33
on 0 67 33
Campbell’s 0 67 33
information 0 67 33
and 0 67 33
were 0 67 33
apprised 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
the 0 67 33
various 0 67 33
facets 0 67 33
pertaining 0 67 33
to 0 67 33
Russia’s 0 67 33
acquisition 0 67 33
of 0 67 33
the 0 67 33
Canadian 0 67 33
company. 0 67 33

In 0 67 34
fact, 0 67 34
Campbell 0 67 34
had 0 67 34
been 0 67 34
told 0 67 34
by 0 67 34
his 0 67 34
FBI 0 67 34
handlers 0 67 34
that 0 67 34
his 0 67 34
work 0 67 34
had 0 67 34
made 0 67 34
it 0 67 34
at 0 67 34
least 0 67 34
twice 0 67 34
into 0 67 34
President 0 67 34
Obama’s 0 67 34
classified 0 67 34
presidential 0 67 34
daily 0 67 34
briefings. 0 67 34

Of 1 67 35
course, 1 67 35
we 1 67 35
know 1 67 35
what 1 67 35
Obama 1 67 35
did 1 67 35
with 1 67 35
his 1 67 35
daily 1 67 35
briefings. 1 67 35

They 1 67 36
are 1 67 36
somewhere 1 67 36
in 1 67 36
the 1 67 36
White 1 67 36

sewer 1 67 36

Campbell's 0 67 37
work 0 67 37
has 0 67 37
resulted 0 67 37
in 0 67 37
real 0 67 37
justice 0 67 37
being 0 67 37
administered. 0 67 37

In 0 67 38
January, 0 67 38
I 0 67 38
reported: 0 67 38

On 0 67 39
Friday, 0 67 39
the 0 67 39

Lambert, 0 67 41

was 0 67 41

in 0 155 7

Arnold 0 155 8
picked 0 155 8

she 0 155 8

Australia. 0 155 8

But 0 155 9
when 0 155 9
Arnold 0 155 9

her 0 155 9

had 0 155 9
failed 0 155 9
her. 0 155 9

Why? 0 155 10

Because, 0 155 11
according 0 155 11
to 0 155 11
the 0 155 11
teacher, 0 155 11
"Australia 0 155 11
is 0 155 11
a 0 155 11
continent; 0 155 11
not 0 155 11
a 0 155 11

Sociology. 1 155 12

You 1 155 13
really 1 155 13
don't 1 155 13
need 1 155 13
to 1 155 13
know 1 155 13
anything. 1 155 13

The 1 155 14
professor, 1 155 14
who 1 155 14
has 1 155 14
a 1 155 14
PhD 1 155 14
in 1 155 14
philosophy... 1 155 14

Of 1 155 15
course 1 155 15
she 1 155 15
does. 1 155 15

I 0 155 16
believe 0 155 16
I 0 155 16
got 0 155 16
zero 0 155 16
or 0 155 16
partial 0 155 16
credit 0 155 16
because 0 155 16
the 0 155 16
instructor 0 155 16
said, 0 155 16
'Australia 0 155 16
is 0 155 16
a 0 155 16
continent; 0 155 16
not 0 155 16
a 0 155 16
country. 0 155 16

However, 0 155 17
I 0 155 17
believe 0 155 17
that 0 155 17
Australia 0 155 17
is 0 155 17
a 0 155 17
country. 0 155 17

The 0 155 18
research 0 155 18
starter 0 155 18
on 0 155 18
the 0 155 18
SNHU’s 0 155 18
Shapiro 0 155 18

by 0 155 18
John 0 155 18
Pearson 0 155 18
(2013) 0 155 18
states, 0 155 18
that 0 155 18
Australia 0 155 18
is 0 155 18
the 0 155 18
'sixth-largest 0 155 18
country 0 155 18
in 0 155 18
the 0 155 18
world' 0 155 18
(n.p.). 0 155 18

The 0 155 19
full 0 155 19
name 0 155 19
of 0 155 19
the 0 155 19
country 0 155 19
is 0 155 19
the 0 155 19
Commonwealth 0 155 19
of 0 155 19
Australia, 0 155 19
meaning 0 155 19
Australia 0 155 19
is 0 155 19
both 0 155 19
a 0 155 19
continent 0 155 19
and 0 155 19
a 0 155 19
country. 0 155 19

Therefore, 0 155 20
these 0 155 20
sections 0 155 20
of 0 155 20
the 0 155 20
rubric 0 155 20
should 0 155 20
be 0 155 20
amended. 0 155 20

Australia's 0 155 21
nationhood 0 155 21
is 0 155 21
not 0 155 21
a 0 155 21
matter 0 155 21
of 0 155 21
belief. 0 155 21

But 0 155 22
we 0 155 22
are 0 155 22
in 0 155 22
the 1 155 22
age 1 155 22
of, 1 155 22
"My 1 155 22
truth". 1 155 22

And 0 155 23
my 1 155 23
truth 1 155 23
has 0 155 23
a 0 155 23
different 0 155 23
belief 0 155 23
about 0 155 23
Australia 0 155 23
than 0 155 23
yours 0 155 23
does 0 155 23
because 0 155 23
of 0 155 23
my 0 155 23

of 0 155 23
oppression. 0 155 23

Finally, 0 155 24

the 0 155 25

compared 1 69 18

unfavourably 1 69 18
to 1 69 18
both 1 69 18
the 1 69 18

the 1 69 18

saying 0 69 18
his 0 69 18

evoked 0 69 18
dark 0 69 18

remains 0 69 19
committed 0 69 19
to 0 69 19
his 0 69 19
policy, 0 69 19
claiming 0 69 19
that 0 69 19
Soros 0 69 19
and 0 69 19
supporters 0 69 19
of 0 69 19

are 0 69 19
losing 0 69 19
the 0 69 19

He 0 69 20
said: 0 69 20
“Soros 0 69 20
has 0 69 20
antagonised 0 69 20
not 0 69 20
only 0 69 20
us 0 69 20

also 0 69 20

and 0 69 20
Israel 0 69 20

Everywhere 0 69 21
he 0 69 21
wants 0 69 21
to 0 69 21

It 0 69 22
won't 0 69 22
work. 0 69 22

We 0 69 23
are 0 69 23
not 0 69 23
alone 0 69 23

we 0 69 23

The 0 189 4

a 0 189 4
debate 0 189 4
on 0 189 4
the 0 189 4

And 0 189 5
that 0 189 5
debate 0 189 5
involved 0 189 5
none 0 189 5
other 0 189 5

The 0 189 6
New 0 189 6

has 0 189 6
now 0 189 6
run 0 189 6
its 0 189 6
own 0 189 6
explainer 0 189 6
piece 0 189 6
on 0 189 6
Farrakhan 0 189 6
and 0 189 6
the 0 189 6
Dems 0 189 6
which 0 189 6
mentions 0 189 6
the 0 189 6
infamous 0 189 6
Obama-Farrakhan 0 189 6
photo. 0 189 6

There's 0 189 7
also 0 189 7
a 0 189 7
quote 0 189 7
from 0 189 7
an 0 189 7
Obama 0 189 7
spokeswoman 0 189 7
claiming 0 189 7
that, 0 189 7
“President 0 189 7
Obama 0 189 7
has 0 189 7
denounced 0 189 7
racism 0 189 7
and 0 189 7
anti-Semitism 0 189 7
his 0 189 7
entire 0 189 7
life. 0 189 7

That 0 189 8
includes 0 189 8
his 0 189 8
public 0 189 8
and 0 189 8
repeated 0 189 8
repudiations 0 189 8
of 0 189 8
Louis 0 189 8
Farrakhan’s 0 189 8
views 0 189 8
over 0 189 8
the 0 189 8
years. 0 189 8

Today 0 189 9
is 0 189 9
no 0 189 9
different 0 189 9
– 0 189 9
he 0 189 9
still 0 189 9
rejects 0 189 9
the 1 189 9
harmful 1 189 9
and 1 189 9
divisive 1 189 9
views 1 189 9
Farrakhan 0 189 9
continues 0 189 9
to 0 189 9
espouse.” 0 189 9

That 0 189 10
fails 1 189 10
to 1 189 10
explain 1 189 10
why 1 189 10
he 1 189 10
met 1 189 10
with 1 189 10
him. 1 189 10

And 0 189 11
maybe 0 189 11
one 0 189 11
of 0 189 11
these 0 189 11
days 0 189 11
someone 0 189 11
will 0 189 11
ask 0 189 11
him 0 189 11
that 0 189 11
question. 0 189 11

And 0 189 12
then 0 189 12
Obama 0 189 12
can 0 189 12
give 0 189 12
a 0 189 12
new 0 189 12
remix 0 189 12
of 0 189 12
his 0 189 12
Wright 0 189 12
speech. 0 189 12

"I 0 189 13
can 0 189 13
no 0 189 13
more 0 189 13
disavow 0 189 13
Calypso 0 189 13
Louie 0 189 13
than 0 189 13
I 0 189 13
can 0 189 13
my 0 189 13
dead 0 189 13
white 0 189 13
grandmother." 0 189 13

Rep. 0 189 14
Danny 0 189 14
Davis, 0 189 14
after 0 189 14
defending 0 189 14
Farrakhan, 0 189 14
now 0 189 14
has 0 189 14
a 0 189 14
statement 0 189 14
condemning 0 189 14
him. 0 189 14

But 1 189 15
we've 1 189 15
seen 1 189 15
that 1 189 15
before. 1 189 15

So 1 189 16
it 1 189 16
likely 1 189 16
doesn't 1 189 16
represent 1 189 16
his 1 189 16
views. 1 189 16

After 0 189 17
a 0 189 17
previous 0 189 17
statement, 0 189 17
Rep. 0 189 17
Davis 0 189 17
made 0 189 17
an 0 189 17
infamous 0 189 17
comment 0 189 17
about 0 189 17
the 0 189 17
"Jewish 0 189 17
question". 0 189 17

So 0 189 18
it 0 189 18
probably 0 189 18
still 0 189 18
isn't 0 189 18
over. 0 189 18

The 1 189 19
statement 1 189 19
though 1 189 19
is 1 189 19
full 1 189 19
of 1 189 19
conspiracy 1 189 19
theories 1 189 19
and 1 189 19
blames 1 189 19
everyone 1 189 19
else 1 189 19
for 1 189 19
Davis' 1 189 19
behavior 1 189 19
except 1 189 19
him. 1 189 19

And 0 189 20
now 0 189 20
on 0 189 20

“I’m 0 196 15

by 1 196 15
the 0 196 15

so 0 196 15
much 0 196 15
that 0 196 15

it 0 196 16

“I 0 196 18

it 1 196 18
just 1 196 18

The 0 200 8

wasn’t 0 200 8
sure 0 200 8
why 0 200 8
the 0 200 8

wrote 0 200 8
that 0 200 8

praise 0 200 8
for 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
anti-Semite, 0 200 8
and 0 200 8
said 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
wasn’t 0 200 8
sure 0 200 8
if 0 200 8
someone 0 200 8
from 0 200 8
his 0 200 8

“I 0 200 9

that 0 200 9
was 0 200 9
what 0 200 9
they 0 200 9
wanted 0 200 9
to 0 200 9
write. 0 200 9

Nah, 0 200 10
I 0 200 10
don’t 0 200 10
have 0 200 10
no 0 200 10
problems 0 200 10
with 0 200 10
Farrakhan, 0 200 10
I 0 200 10
don’t 0 200 10
spend 0 200 10
a 0 200 10
whole 0 200 10

of 0 200 10
my 0 200 10

dealing 0 200 10
with 0 200 10
those 0 200 10
kind 0 200 10
of 0 200 10
things,” 0 200 10
Davis 0 200 10
said. 0 200 10

“That’s 0 200 11
just 0 200 11
one 0 200 11
segment 0 200 11
of 0 200 11
what 0 200 11
goes 0 200 11
on 0 200 11
in 0 200 11
our 0 200 11
world. 0 200 11

The 1 200 12
world 1 200 12
is 1 200 12
so 1 200 12
much 1 200 12
bigger 1 200 12
than 1 200 12
Farrakhan 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
the 1 200 12
Jewish 1 200 12
question 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
his 1 200 12
position 1 200 12
on 1 200 12
that 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
so 1 200 12
forth. 1 200 12

For 0 200 13
those 0 200 13
heavy 0 200 13
into 0 200 13
it, 0 200 13
that’s 0 200 13
their 0 200 13
thing, 0 200 13
but 0 200 13
it 0 200 13
ain’t 0 200 13
my 0 200 13
thing,” 0 200 13
he 0 200 13
said 0 200 13

The 0 200 14
term 0 200 14
"Jewish 0 200 14
Question" 0 200 14
is 0 200 14
largely 0 200 14
used 0 200 14
by 0 200 14
anti-Semites. 0 200 14

So 0 200 15
Davis 0 200 15
then 0 200 15
sorta 0 200 15
disavowed 0 200 15
his 0 200 15

J 0 200 16

And 0 200 17
then 0 200 17

talked 0 200 17

anti-Semite, 1 200 18
does 0 200 18
“outstanding 1 200 18

but 0 200 18
doesn’t 0 200 18
agree 0 200 18
with 0 200 18
Farrakhan’s 0 200 18
positions 0 200 18
that 0 200 18
white 1 200 18
people 1 200 18
are 1 200 18
“devils” 1 200 18
and 1 200 18

are 1 200 18

Progress! 0 200 19

"I 1 200 20
don’t 1 200 20

Call 1 200 20
when 1 200 20
I 1 200 20

I’ve 1 200 21
been 1 200 21
to 1 200 21
Saviour’s 1 200 21
Day, 1 200 21
I’ve 1 200 21
read, 1 200 21
I’ve 1 200 21
been 1 200 21
a 1 200 21
fan 1 200 21
of 1 200 21
Elijah 1 200 21
Muhammad, 1 200 21
so 1 200 21
those 1 200 21
are 1 200 21
my 1 200 21
positions, 1 200 21
but 1 200 21
I 1 200 21
do 1 200 21
disagree 1 200 21
with 1 200 21
the 1 200 21
notion 1 200 21
that 1 200 21
white 1 200 21
people 1 200 21
are 1 200 21
devils.” 1 200 21

I 1 200 22
wonder 1 200 22
how 1 200 22
far 1 200 22
a 1 200 22
white 1 200 22
congressman 1 200 22
would 1 200 22
get 1 200 22
saying, 1 200 22
"I 1 200 22
attended 1 200 22
the 1 200 22
Klavern, 1 200 22
but 1 200 22
I 1 200 22
don't 1 200 22
agree 1 200 22
with 1 200 22
the 1 200 22
KKK's 1 200 22
views 1 200 22
about 1 200 22
black 1 200 22
people." 1 200 22

But 0 200 23
that's 0 200 23
Rep. 0 200 23
Davis' 0 200 23
current 0 200 23
views. 0 200 23

He 0 200 24
likes 0 200 24
a 0 200 24
racist 0 200 24
hate 0 200 24
group. 0 200 24

But 0 200 25
doesn't 0 200 25
believe 0 200 25
white 0 200 25
people 0 200 25
are 0 200 25
devils 1 200 25
or 0 200 25
Jews 0 200 25
are 0 200 25
satanic. 1 200 25

Whoever 0 200 26
the 0 200 26
JTA 0 200 26
has 0 200 26
on 0 200 26
the 0 200 26

going 0 200 26

even 1 203 4

they 1 203 4
had 1 203 4

that 1 203 6
is 1 203 6
that 1 203 6

as 1 203 7
well 1 203 7
as 1 203 7
civilians. 1 203 7

We 0 203 8
know 0 203 8
that 0 203 8
Kazi, 0 203 8
with 0 203 8
all 0 203 8
the 0 203 8
propane 0 203 8

his 0 203 8

was 0 203 8
clearly 0 203 8
trying 0 203 8
to 0 203 8
set 0 203 8
off 0 203 8
a 0 203 8
major 0 203 8

that 0 203 8
would 0 203 8
kill 0 203 8
more 0 203 8
people 0 203 8
than 0 203 8
just 0 203 8
himself. 0 203 8

Even 0 203 9
if 0 203 9
he 0 203 9
wasn’t 0 203 9
on 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
phone 0 203 9
to 0 203 9
Baghdadi, 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
likelihood 0 203 9
is 0 203 9
that 0 203 9
when 0 203 9
a 0 203 9

with 0 203 9
a 0 203 9
car 0 203 9
full 0 203 9
of 0 203 9
incendiaries, 0 203 9
probably 0 203 9
this 0 203 9
has 0 203 9
something 0 203 9
to 0 203 9
do 0 203 9
with 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
global 0 203 9
jihad. 0 203 9

The 0 203 10
FBI’s 0 203 10
bafflement 0 203 10
here 0 203 10
is 0 203 10
part 0 203 10
of 0 203 10
its 0 203 10
deep, 0 203 10
deep 0 203 10
corruption. 0 203 10

The 0 203 11
FBI 0 203 11
doesn’t 0 203 11
acknowledge 0 203 11
that 0 203 11
there 0 203 11
is 0 203 11
a 0 203 11
global 0 203 11
jihad, 0 203 11
or 0 203 11
that 0 203 11
Islam 0 203 11
has 0 203 11
anything 0 203 11
to 0 203 11
do 0 203 11
with 0 203 11
terrorism. 0 203 11

It 0 203 12
doesn’t 0 203 12
admit 0 203 12
that 0 203 12
there 0 203 12
is 0 203 12
a 0 203 12
war 0 203 12
going 0 203 12
on, 0 203 12
and 0 203 12
treats 0 203 12
each 0 203 12
act 0 203 12
of 0 203 12
Islamic 0 203 12
terror 0 203 12
as 0 203 12
if 0 203 12
it 0 203 12
were 0 203 12
a 0 203 12
separate 0 203 12
and 0 203 12
discrete 0 203 12
criminal 0 203 12
event, 0 203 12
unrelated 0 203 12
to 0 203 12
all 0 203 12
the 0 203 12
others. 0 203 12

So, 0 203 13
each 0 203 13
time 0 203 13
something 0 203 13
like 0 203 13
this 0 203 13
happens, 0 203 13
they’re 0 203 13

trying 0 203 13
to 0 203 13

It’s 0 203 14
as 0 203 14
if 0 203 14
the 0 203 14
U.S. 0 203 14

if 0 203 14
each 0 203 14

had 0 203 14
anything 0 203 14

This 0 203 15
willful 0 203 15
ignorance 0 203 15
leads 0 203 15
to 0 203 15
a 0 203 15

This 0 236 2
is 0 236 2
hardly 0 236 2

Of 0 236 6
course, 0 236 6

Even 0 236 21
when 0 236 21

Parents 0 236 23

in 0 236 23
providing 0 236 23
their 0 236 23
children 0 236 23

a 0 236 23

emphasizing 0 236 23
the 0 236 23
ideas 0 236 23
of 0 236 23
liberty 0 236 23
should 0 236 23
consider 0 236 23
looking 0 236 23
into 0 236 23
my 0 236 23
homeschooling 1 236 23
curriculum. 0 236 23

The 0 236 24
Ron 0 236 24
Paul 0 236 24
Curriculum 0 236 24
provides 0 236 24
students 0 236 24
with 0 236 24
a 0 236 24
well-rounded 1 236 24
education 1 236 24
that 0 236 24
includes 0 236 24
rigorous 0 236 24
programs 0 236 24
in 0 236 24
history, 0 236 24
mathematics, 0 236 24
and 0 236 24
the 0 236 24
physical 0 236 24
and 0 236 24
natural 0 236 24
sciences. 0 236 24

The 0 236 25
curriculum 0 236 25
also 0 236 25
provides 0 236 25
instruction 0 236 25
in 0 236 25
personal 0 236 25
finance. 0 236 25

Students 0 236 26
can 0 236 26
develop 0 236 26
superior 0 236 26
oral 0 236 26
and 0 236 26
verbal 0 236 26
communication 0 236 26

and 0 236 26
public 0 236 26
speaking 0 236 26
courses. 0 236 26

Another 0 236 27
feature 0 236 27
of 0 236 27
my 1 236 27
curriculum 1 236 27
is 0 236 27
that 0 236 27
it 0 236 27
provides 0 236 27
students 0 236 27
the 0 236 27
opportunity 0 236 27
to 0 236 27
create 0 236 27
and 0 236 27
run 0 236 27
their 0 236 27
own 0 236 27
internet 0 236 27
businesses. 0 236 27

The 0 236 28
government 0 236 28
and 0 236 28
history 0 236 28
sections 0 236 28
of 0 236 28
the 0 236 28
curriculum 0 236 28
emphasize 0 236 28
Austrian 0 236 28
economics, 0 236 28
libertarian 0 236 28
political 0 236 28
theory, 0 236 28
and 0 236 28
the 0 236 28
history 0 236 28
of 0 236 28
liberty. 0 236 28

However, 0 236 29
unlike 0 236 29
government 0 236 29
schools, 0 236 29
my 1 236 29
curriculum 1 236 29
never 0 236 29
puts 0 236 29
ideological 0 236 29
indoctrination 1 236 29
ahead 0 236 29
of 0 236 29
education. 0 236 29

While 0 236 30
government 0 236 30
schools 0 236 30
— 0 236 30
and 0 236 30
even 0 236 30
many 0 236 30
private 0 236 30
schools 0 236 30
— 0 236 30
pretend 0 236 30
religion 0 236 30
played 0 236 30
no 0 236 30
significant 0 236 30
role 0 236 30
in 0 236 30
history, 0 236 30
my 1 236 30
curriculum 1 236 30
addresses 0 236 30
the 0 236 30
crucial 1 236 30
role 0 236 30
religion 0 236 30
played 0 236 30
in 0 236 30
the 0 236 30
development 0 236 30
of 0 236 30
Western 0 236 30
civilization. 0 236 30

However, 0 236 31
the 0 236 31
materials 0 236 31
are 0 236 31
drafted 0 236 31
in 0 236 31
such 0 236 31
a 0 236 31
way 0 236 31
that 0 236 31
any 0 236 31
Christian, 0 236 31
Jewish, 0 236 31
Muslim, 0 236 31
or 0 236 31
atheist 0 236 31
parent 0 236 31
can 0 236 31
feel 0 236 31
comfortable 0 236 31
using 0 236 31
the 0 236 31
curriculum. 0 236 31

Interactive 0 236 32

students 0 236 32
to 0 236 32
engage 0 236 32

and 0 236 32
learn 0 236 32
from 0 236 32
each 0 236 32
other. 0 236 32

The 0 236 33
forums 0 236 33
ensure 0 236 33
students 0 236 33
are 0 236 33
actively 0 236 33

in 0 236 33
their 0 236 33

the 0 236 34

of 0 236 34

in 0 236 34
government-run 0 236 34

is 0 236 34
one 0 236 34
reason 0 236 34
many 0 236 34
parents 0 236 34
are 0 236 34
considering 0 236 34
homeschooling, 1 236 34
but 0 236 34
it 0 236 34
is 0 236 34
not 0 236 34
the 0 236 34
only 0 236 34
reason. 0 236 34

Many 0 236 35
parents 0 236 35
are 0 236 35
motivated 0 236 35
by 0 236 35
a 0 236 35
desire 0 236 35

give 0 236 35
their 0 236 35
children 0 236 35
something 0 236 35
better 0 236 35
than 0 236 35
a 0 236 35

wish 0 236 36
to 0 236 36
have 0 236 36
their 0 236 36
children 0 236 36
indoctrinated 1 236 36
with 0 236 36
