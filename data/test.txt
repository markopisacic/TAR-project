warned 0 0 1
the 0 0 1
next 0 0 1

Ghebreyesus 0 0 2
told 0 0 2

insisting 0 0 2
that 0 0 2
"the 0 0 2

An 0 0 3
outbreak 0 0 3
of 0 0 3
both 0 0 3

Madagascar 0 0 4
has 0 0 4
suffered 0 0 4
bubonic 0 0 4
plague 0 0 4
outbreaks 0 0 4
almost 0 0 4
every 0 0 4
year 0 0 4
since 0 0 4

often 0 0 4
caused 0 0 4
by 0 0 4
rats 0 0 4
fleeing 0 0 4
forest 0 0 4
fires. 0 0 4

The 0 0 5
disease 0 0 5
tends 0 0 5
to 0 0 5
make 0 0 5
a 0 0 5
comeback 0 0 5
each 0 0 5
hot 0 0 5
rainy 0 0 5
season, 0 0 5
from 0 0 5
September 0 0 5
to 0 0 5
April. 0 0 5

On 0 0 6
average, 0 0 6
between 0 0 6
300 0 0 6
and 0 0 6
600 0 0 6
infections 0 0 6
are 0 0 6

a 0 0 6
population 0 0 6
approaching 0 0 6

million 0 0 6
people, 0 0 6
according 0 0 6
to 0 0 6
a 0 0 6
UN 0 0 6
estimate. 0 0 6

But 0 0 7
Tedros 0 0 7
voiced 0 0 7
alarm 0 0 7
that 0 0 7
"plague 0 0 7
in 0 0 7
Madagascar 0 0 7
behaved 0 0 7
in 0 0 7
a 1 0 7
very, 1 0 7
very 1 0 7
different 1 0 7
way 0 0 7
this 0 0 7
year." 0 0 7

Cases 0 0 8
sprang 0 0 8
up 0 0 8
far 0 0 8
earlier 0 0 8
than 0 0 8
usual 0 0 8
and, 0 0 8
instead 0 0 8
of 0 0 8
being 0 0 8
confined 0 0 8
to 0 0 8
the 0 0 8
countryside, 0 0 8
the 0 0 8
disease 0 0 8
infiltrated 0 0 8

towns. 0 0 9
The 0 0 9
authorities 0 0 9
recorded 0 0 9
more 0 0 9
than 0 0 9
2 0 0 9
000 0 0 9
cases, 0 0 9
and 0 0 9
Tedros 0 0 9
said 0 0 9
Wednesday 0 0 9
the 0 0 9
death 0 0 9
toll 0 0 9
stood 0 0 9
at 0 0 9

207. 0 0 10
He 1 0 10
also 1 0 10
pointed 1 0 10
to 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
presence 1 0 10
of 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
pneumonic 1 0 10
version, 1 0 10
which 1 0 10
spreads 1 0 10
more 1 0 10
easily 1 0 10
and 1 0 10
is 1 0 10
more 1 0 10
virulent, 1 0 10
in 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
latest 1 0 10
outbreak. 1 0 10

He 0 0 11
praised 0 0 11
the 0 0 11
rapid 0 0 11
response 0 0 11
from 0 0 11
WHO 0 0 11
and 0 0 11
Madagascar 0 0 11
authorities 0 0 11
that 0 0 11
helped 0 0 11
bring 0 0 11
the 0 0 11
outbreak 0 0 11
under 0 0 11
control, 0 0 11
but 1 0 11
warned 1 0 11
that 1 0 11
the 1 0 11
danger 1 0 11
was 1 0 11
not 1 0 11

over. 1 0 12
The 0 0 12
larger-than-usual 0 0 12
outbreak 0 0 12
had 0 0 12
helped 0 0 12
spread 0 0 12
the 0 0 12
bacteria 0 0 12
that 0 0 12
causes 0 0 12
the 0 0 12
plague 0 0 12
more 0 0 12

widely. 0 0 13
This 0 0 13
along 0 0 13
with 0 0 13
poor 0 0 13
sanitation 0 0 13
and 0 0 13
vector 0 0 13
control 0 0 13
on 0 0 13
Madagascar 0 0 13
meant 0 0 13
that 0 0 13
"when 1 0 13
(the 1 0 13
plague) 1 0 13
comes 1 0 13
again 1 0 13
it 1 0 13
starts 1 0 13
from 1 0 13
more 1 0 13
stock, 1 0 13
and 1 0 13
the 1 0 13
magnitude 1 0 13
in 1 0 13
the 1 0 13
next 1 0 13
transmission 1 0 13
could 1 0 13
be 1 0 13
higher 1 0 13
than 1 0 13
the 1 0 13
one 1 0 13
that 1 0 13
we 1 0 13
saw," 1 0 13
Tedros 0 0 13

said. 0 0 14
"That 0 0 14
means 0 0 14
that 0 0 14
Madagascar 0 0 14
could 0 0 14
be 0 0 14
affected 0 0 14
more, 0 0 14
and 0 0 14
not 0 0 14
only 0 0 14
that, 0 0 14
it 1 0 14
could 1 0 14
even 1 0 14
spill 1 0 14
over 1 0 14
into 1 0 14
neighbouring 1 0 14
countries 1 0 14
and 1 0 14
beyond," 1 0 14

he 0 0 15
warned. 0 0 15
Complicating 0 0 15
vector 0 0 15
control 0 0 15
is 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
fact 0 0 15
that 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
fleas 0 0 15
that 0 0 15
carry 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
Yersinia 0 0 15
pestis 0 0 15
bacteria 0 0 15
that 0 0 15
causes 0 0 15
the 0 0 15
plague 0 0 15

"That's 0 0 15

a 0 0 15

combination," 0 0 15

outrage 1 2 1
Thursday 0 2 1

as 0 2 1
top 0 2 1
conservatives 0 2 1
and 0 2 1
critics 0 2 1
of 0 2 1
so-called 0 2 1
"sanctuary 0 2 1

for 1 2 1
Steinle's 1 2 1

Garcia 0 2 2
Zarate, 0 2 2
a 0 2 2
45-year-old 0 2 2
Mexican 0 2 2
national 0 2 2
who 0 2 2
was 0 2 2
homeless 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
living 0 2 2
in 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
US 0 2 2
illegally 0 2 2
when 0 2 2
he 0 2 2
fired 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
shot 0 2 2
that 0 2 2
killed 0 2 2
Steinle, 0 2 2
was 0 2 2
acquitted 0 2 2
by 0 2 2
a 0 2 2
jury 0 2 2
on 0 2 2
murder 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
manslaughter 0 2 2
charges. 0 2 2

The 0 2 3
jury 0 2 3
convicted 0 2 3
him 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
the 0 2 3
lesser 0 2 3
charge 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
being 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
felon 0 2 3
in 0 2 3
possession 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
gun, 0 2 3
which 0 2 3
carries 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
maximum 0 2 3
sentence 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
three 0 2 3
years 0 2 3
in 0 2 3
state 0 2 3
prison. 0 2 3

Steinle, 0 2 4
32, 0 2 4
was 0 2 4
fatally 0 2 4
shot 0 2 4
while 0 2 4
she 0 2 4
walked 0 2 4
along 0 2 4
Pier 0 2 4
14 0 2 4
of 0 2 4
the 0 2 4
San 0 2 4
Francisco 0 2 4
Bay 0 2 4
with 0 2 4
her 0 2 4
father 0 2 4
in 0 2 4
July 0 2 4
2015. 0 2 4

The 0 2 5
bullet 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
pierced 0 2 5
her 0 2 5
back 0 2 5
had 0 2 5
ricocheted 0 2 5
off 0 2 5
the 0 2 5
concrete 0 2 5
ground 0 2 5
after 0 2 5
it 0 2 5
was 0 2 5
fired 0 2 5
by 0 2 5
Garcia 0 2 5
Zarate 0 2 5
from 0 2 5
a 0 2 5
handgun 0 2 5
belonging 0 2 5
to 0 2 5
a 0 2 5
federal 0 2 5
ranger 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
had 0 2 5
been 0 2 5
stolen 0 2 5
four 0 2 5
days 0 2 5
earlier. 0 2 5

Garcia 0 2 6
Zarate's 0 2 6
defense 0 2 6
attorneys 0 2 6
argued 0 2 6
that 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
shooting 0 2 6
was 0 2 6
an 0 2 6
accident 0 2 6
— 0 2 6
they 0 2 6
said 0 2 6
he 0 2 6
found 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
gun 0 2 6
wrapped 0 2 6
in 0 2 6
a 0 2 6
T-shirt 0 2 6
or 0 2 6
cloth 0 2 6
under 0 2 6
a 0 2 6
pier 0 2 6
bench 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
unintentionally 0 2 6
discharged 0 2 6

it. 0 2 7
Lead 0 2 7
attorney 0 2 7
Matt 0 2 7
Gonzalez 0 2 7
has 0 2 7
argued 0 2 7
that 0 2 7
the 0 2 7
weapon 0 2 7
was 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
SIG 0 2 7
Sauer 0 2 7
with 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
"hair 1 2 7
trigger 1 2 7
in 1 2 7
single-action 1 2 7
mode" 1 2 7
— 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
model 0 2 7
well-known 0 2 7
for 0 2 7
accidental 0 2 7
discharges 0 2 7
even 0 2 7
among 0 2 7
experienced 0 2 7
shooters. 0 2 7

Gonzalez 0 2 8
told 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
jury, 0 2 8
according 0 2 8
to 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
San 0 2 8
Francisco 0 2 8
Chronicle, 0 2 8
that 0 2 8
Garcia 0 2 8
Zarate 0 2 8
had 0 2 8
never 0 2 8
handled 0 2 8
a 0 2 8
firearm 0 2 8
before, 0 2 8
was 0 2 8
frightened 0 2 8
by 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
noise 0 2 8
of 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
gunshot, 0 2 8
then 0 2 8
flung 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
weapon 0 2 8
into 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
bay 0 2 8
where 0 2 8
it 0 2 8
was 0 2 8
later 0 2 8
found 0 2 8
by 0 2 8
a 0 2 8
diver. 0 2 8

Prosecutors, 0 2 9
however, 0 2 9
alleged 0 2 9
that 0 2 9
Garcia 0 2 9
Zarate 0 2 9
brought 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
weapon 0 2 9
to 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
pier 0 2 9
deliberately 0 2 9
to 0 2 9
do 0 2 9
harm, 0 2 9
and 0 2 9
intentionally 0 2 9
aimed 0 2 9
and 0 2 9
shot 0 2 9
Steinle 0 2 9
after 0 2 9
firmly 0 2 9
pulling 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
trigger. 0 2 9

They 0 2 10
said 0 2 10
Garcia 0 2 10
Zarate 0 2 10
then 0 2 10
threw 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
weapon 0 2 10
into 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
bay 0 2 10
and 0 2 10
fled 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
scene. 0 2 10

Beyond 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
shooting 0 2 11
itself, 0 2 11
perhaps 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
most 0 2 11
controversial 0 2 11
aspect 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
Garcia 0 2 11
Zarate's 0 2 11
case 0 2 11
involves 0 2 11
his 0 2 11
previous 0 2 11
criminal 0 2 11
activity 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
history 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
deportations, 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
how 0 2 11
San 0 2 11
Francisco 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
federal 0 2 11
authorities 0 2 11
handled 0 2 11
his 0 2 11
custody 0 2 11
before 0 2 11
he 0 2 11
ever 0 2 11
picked 0 2 11
up 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
gun 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
shot 0 2 11
Steinle. 0 2 11

At 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
time 0 2 12
of 0 2 12
Steinle's 0 2 12
death, 0 2 12
Garcia 0 2 12
Zarate 0 2 12
had 0 2 12
been 0 2 12
convicted 0 2 12
of 0 2 12
nonviolent 0 2 12
drug 0 2 12
crimes 0 2 12
and 0 2 12
deported 0 2 12
five 0 2 12
times 0 2 12
since 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
early 0 2 12
1990s. 0 2 12

He 0 2 13
faced 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
sixth 0 2 13
deportation 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
2015, 0 2 13
and 0 2 13
was 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
Justice 0 2 13
Department 0 2 13
(DOJ) 0 2 13
custody 0 2 13
that 0 2 13
March 0 2 13
after 0 2 13
serving 0 2 13
46 0 2 13
months 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
prison 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
felony 0 2 13
re-entry 0 2 13
into 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
US, 0 2 13

instead 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
transferring 0 2 13
him 0 2 13
into 0 2 13

of 0 2 13
Immigration 0 2 13
and 0 2 13
Customs 0 2 13
Enforcement 0 2 13
(ICE) 0 2 13
for 0 2 13

the 0 2 13

him 0 2 13
to 0 2 13

who 0 2 14
had 0 2 14
long 0 2 14
ago 0 2 14
deprioritized 0 2 14

dismissed 0 2 14

2015. 0 2 15
Due 0 2 15
to 0 2 15
San 0 2 15

policy 0 2 15

limiting 0 2 15

— 0 2 15
which 0 2 15
some 0 2 15
refer 0 2 15
to 0 2 15
as 0 2 15
a 0 2 15
"sanctuary" 1 2 15

— 0 2 15
the 0 2 15

they 0 2 15
released 0 2 15

Zarate. 0 2 16
As 0 2 16
a 0 2 16
result 0 2 16
of 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
case, 0 2 16
both 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
DOJ 0 2 16
and 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
city 0 2 16
of 0 2 16
San 0 2 16
Francisco 0 2 16
have 0 2 16
changed 0 2 16
several 0 2 16
policies. 0 2 16

The 0 2 17
DOJ 0 2 17
announced 0 2 17
in 0 2 17
2016 0 2 17
it 0 2 17
would 0 2 17
no 0 2 17
longer 0 2 17
release 0 2 17
potentially 0 2 17
deportable 0 2 17
detainees 0 2 17
to 0 2 17
local 0 2 17
jails 0 2 17
without 0 2 17
first 0 2 17
allowing 0 2 17
ICE 0 2 17
to 0 2 17
take 0 2 17

custody. 0 2 18
San 0 2 18
Francisco, 0 2 18
meanwhile, 0 2 18
has 0 2 18
adjusted 0 2 18
its 0 2 18
policy 0 2 18
to 0 2 18
notify 0 2 18
ICE 0 2 18
if 0 2 18
they 0 2 18
are 0 2 18
releasing 0 2 18
suspected 0 2 18
undocumented 0 2 18
immigrants 0 2 18
who 0 2 18
face 0 2 18
charges 0 2 18
of 0 2 18
serious 0 2 18
or 0 2 18
violent 0 2 18
felonies. 0 2 18

"This 1 2 19
tragedy 1 2 19
could 1 2 19
have 1 2 19
been 1 2 19
prevented 1 2 19
if 1 2 19
San 1 2 19
Francisco 1 2 19
had 1 2 19
simply 1 2 19
turned 1 2 19
the 1 2 19
alien 1 2 19
over 1 2 19
to 1 2 19
ICE 1 2 19
as 1 2 19
we 1 2 19
requested, 1 2 19
instead 1 2 19
of 1 2 19
releasing 1 2 19
him 1 2 19
back 1 2 19
onto 1 2 19
the 1 2 19
streets," 1 2 19
ICE 0 2 19
Director 0 2 19
Thomas 0 2 19
Homan 0 2 19
said 0 2 19
in 0 2 19
a 0 2 19
statement 0 2 19
on 0 2 19

Thursday. 0 2 20
"It 0 2 20
is 0 2 20
unconscionable 0 2 20
that 0 2 20
politicians 1 2 20
across 1 2 20
this 1 2 20
country 1 2 20
continue 1 2 20
to 1 2 20
endanger 1 2 20
the 1 2 20
lives 1 2 20
of 1 2 20
Americans 1 2 20
with 1 2 20
sanctuary 1 2 20
policies 1 2 20
while 1 2 20
ignoring 1 2 20
the 1 2 20
harm 1 2 20
inflicted 1 2 20
on 1 2 20
their 1 2 20
constituents." 1 2 20

But 0 2 21
ICE 0 2 21
has 0 2 21
faced 0 2 21
criticism 0 2 21
of 0 2 21
its 0 2 21
own 0 2 21
over 0 2 21
not 0 2 21
seeking 0 2 21
a 0 2 21
judicial 0 2 21
warrant 0 2 21
to 0 2 21
legally 0 2 21
obtain 0 2 21
custody 0 2 21
of 0 2 21
Garcia 0 2 21
Zarate 0 2 21
when 0 2 21
it 0 2 21
discovered 0 2 21
he 0 2 21
had 0 2 21
been 0 2 21
transferred 0 2 21
into 0 2 21
San 0 2 21
Francisco's 0 2 21

custody. 0 2 22
The 0 2 22
agency 0 2 22
has 0 2 22
argued 0 2 22
that 0 2 22
obtaining 0 2 22
judicial 0 2 22
warrants 0 2 22
are 0 2 22
unnecessary 0 2 22
and 0 2 22
would 0 2 22
place 0 2 22
too 0 2 22
much 0 2 22
burden 0 2 22
on 0 2 22
ICE 0 2 22
officials 0 2 22
and 0 2 22
federal 0 2 22

courts. 0 2 23
Though 0 2 23
the 0 2 23
agency 0 2 23
did 0 2 23
issue 0 2 23
a 0 2 23
request 0 2 23
to 0 2 23
the 0 2 23
city 0 2 23
to 0 2 23
detain 0 2 23
Garcia 0 2 23
Zarate 0 2 23
until 0 2 23
ICE 0 2 23
officials 0 2 23
could 0 2 23
pick 0 2 23
him 0 2 23
up, 0 2 23
their 0 2 23
detainer 0 2 23
requests 0 2 23
are 0 2 23
not 0 2 23
signed 0 2 23
by 0 2 23
a 0 2 23
judge 0 2 23
and 0 2 23
are 0 2 23
therefore 0 2 23
not 0 2 23
legally 0 2 23

binding. 0 2 24
San 0 2 24
Francisco's 0 2 24
policy 0 2 24
is 0 2 24
to 0 2 24
ignore 0 2 24
such 0 2 24
requests 0 2 24
if 0 2 24
they 0 2 24
are 0 2 24
not 0 2 24
accompanied 0 2 24
by 0 2 24
judge-signed 0 2 24
warrants, 0 2 24
and 0 2 24
the 0 2 24
city 0 2 24
has 0 2 24
cited 0 2 24
federal 0 2 24
court 0 2 24
cases 0 2 24
concluding 0 2 24
that 0 2 24
such 0 2 24

violate 0 2 24

Fourth 0 2 24
Amendment 0 2 24

Garcia 0 2 25
Zarate's 0 2 25
deportation 0 2 25
and 0 2 25
criminal 0 2 25
history 0 2 25
made 0 2 25
him 0 2 25
an 0 2 25
effective 0 2 25
target 0 2 25
for 0 2 25
immigration 0 2 25
hardliners, 0 2 25
who 0 2 25
argued 0 2 25
that 0 2 25

would 1 2 25
still 1 2 25
be 1 2 25
alive 1 2 25

it 1 2 25
not 1 2 25
for 1 2 25

President 0 2 26
Donald 0 2 26

immediately 0 2 26
seized 0 2 26
on 0 2 26
the 0 2 26
verdict 0 2 26
on 0 2 26
Thursday 0 2 26
as 0 2 26

of 0 2 26
the 0 2 26
perils 0 2 26
of 0 2 26
"Illegal 0 2 26

Trump 0 2 27
frequently 0 2 27
villainized 0 2 27
Garcia 0 2 27
Zarate 0 2 27
and 0 2 27
cited 0 2 27

death 0 2 27
during 0 2 27
his 0 2 27
presidential 0 2 27
campaign, 0 2 27
using 0 2 27
the 0 2 27

his 0 2 27

Early 0 2 28
on 0 2 28

also 0 2 28

to 0 5 4
a 0 5 4

the 0 5 5

the 1 5 5

the 0 16 6

that 0 16 6
his 0 16 6

is 0 16 6
not 0 16 6
only 0 16 6
acceptable 0 16 6
to 0 16 6
God 0 16 6
but 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
even 0 16 6
what 0 16 6
God 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
asking 0 16 6
“for 0 16 6

given 0 16 6
one’s 0 16 6
particular 0 16 6

This 0 16 6
outrageous 0 16 6
proposition, 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
form 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
situation 0 16 6

that 0 16 6

foundation 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
Catholic 0 16 6
moral 0 16 6
teaching, 0 16 6
has 0 16 6
justly 0 16 6
provoked 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
storm 0 16 6
of 0 16 6

what 0 16 13
does 0 16 13
the 0 16 13

Here 0 16 14

the 0 16 14
paragraph 0 16 14

Yes, 0 16 16
and 0 16 16
so 0 16 16
what? 0 16 16

Well, 0 16 17
according 0 16 17
to 0 16 17
Fastiggi 0 16 17
and 0 16 17
Goldstein, 0 16 17
while 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
English 0 16 17
translation 0 16 17
reads: 0 16 17
“what 0 16 17
for 0 16 17
now 0 16 17
is 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
most 0 16 17
generous 0 16 17
response 0 16 17
which 0 16 17
can 0 16 17
be 0 16 17
given 0 16 17
to 0 16 17
God,” 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
Latin 0 16 17
employs 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
word 0 16 17
oblationem, 0 16 17
which 0 16 17
means 0 16 17
offering. 0 16 17

So, 0 16 18
What 0 16 18
the 0 16 18
Pope 0 16 18
Really 0 16 18
Means® 0 16 18
is: 0 16 18
“what 0 16 18
for 0 16 18
now 0 16 18
is 0 16 18
the 0 16 18
most 0 16 18
generous 0 16 18
offering 0 16 18
which 0 16 18
can 0 16 18
be 0 16 18
given 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God.” 0 16 18
So, 0 16 18
it’s 0 16 18
an 0 16 18
offering 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God, 0 16 18
not 0 16 18
a 0 16 18
response 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God. 0 16 18

Big 0 16 19
difference. 0 16 19

But 0 16 20
just 0 16 20
a 0 16 20
moment: 0 16 20
how 0 16 20
can 0 16 20
objectively 0 16 20
immoral 0 16 20
behavior 0 16 20
ever 0 16 20
be 0 16 20
characterized 0 16 20
as 0 16 20
an 0 16 20
“offering” 0 16 20
to 0 16 20
God? 0 16 20

It 0 16 21
would 0 16 21
seem 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
Latin 0 16 21
version 0 16 21
has 0 16 21
graver 0 16 21
implications 0 16 21
than 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
English 0 16 21
because 0 16 21
it 0 16 21
suggests 0 16 21
that 0 16 21
falling 0 16 21
short 0 16 21
of 0 16 21
what 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
moral 0 16 21
law 0 16 21
requires 0 16 21
is 0 16 21
an 0 16 21
oblation 0 16 21
pleasing 0 16 21
to 0 16 21
God 0 16 21
if 0 16 21
one’s 0 16 21
“limits” 0 16 21
make 0 16 21
obedience 0 16 21
to 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
moral 0 16 21
law 0 16 21
difficult. 0 16 21

And 1 16 22
that 1 16 22
is 1 16 22
exactly 1 16 22
the 1 16 22
nonsense 1 16 22
Fastiggi 1 16 22
and 1 16 22
Goldstein 1 16 22
expect 1 16 22
us 1 16 22
to 1 16 22
swallow: 1 16 22
“Pope 0 16 22
Francis 0 16 22
is 0 16 22
not 0 16 22
talking 0 16 22
about 0 16 22
an 0 16 22
offering 0 16 22
of 0 16 22
an 0 16 22
objectively 0 16 22
sinful 0 16 22
action 0 16 22
but 0 16 22
a 0 16 22
gift 0 16 22
of 0 16 22
self 0 16 22
that 0 16 22
moves 0 16 22
toward 0 16 22
God 0 16 22
and 0 16 22
the 0 16 22
objective 0 16 22
moral 0 16 22
norm.” 0 16 22

So, 0 16 23
our 1 16 23
intrepid 1 16 23
presenters 1 16 23
of 0 16 23
What 0 16 23
the 0 16 23
Pope 0 16 23
Really 0 16 23
Means® 0 16 23
would 0 16 23
have 0 16 23
us 0 16 23
believe 0 16 23
that 0 16 23
objectively 0 16 23
immoral 0 16 23
behavior, 0 16 23
which 0 16 23
is 0 16 23
the 0 16 23
best 0 16 23
one 0 16 23
can 0 16 23
do 0 16 23
according 0 16 23
“the 0 16 23
“concrete 0 16 23
complexity 0 16 23
of 0 16 23
one’s 0 16 23
limits,” 0 16 23
is 0 16 23
no 0 16 23
longer 0 16 23
simply 0 16 23
objectively 0 16 23
immoral 0 16 23
behavior 0 16 23
but 0 16 23
rather 0 16 23
a 0 16 23
gift 0 16 23
of 0 16 23
self 0 16 23
because 0 16 23
it 0 16 23
moves 0 16 23
toward 0 16 23
morally 0 16 23
licit 0 16 23
behavior. 0 16 23

Fastiggi 0 16 24
and 0 16 24
Goldstein 0 16 24
have 0 16 24
managed 0 16 24
to 0 16 24
make 0 16 24
the 0 16 24
problem 0 16 24
even 0 16 24
worse 0 16 24
in 0 16 24
their 0 16 24
attempt 0 16 24
to 0 16 24
explain 0 16 24
it 0 16 24
away. 0 16 24

What 0 16 25
about 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
English 0 16 25
locution 0 16 25
“while 0 16 25
yet 0 16 25
not 0 16 25
fully 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
objective 0 16 25
ideal,” 0 16 25
which 0 16 25
seems 0 16 25
to 0 16 25
reduce 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
negative 0 16 25
precepts 0 16 25
of 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
natural 0 16 25
law 0 16 25
to 0 16 25
mere 0 16 25
ideals? 0 16 25

Not 0 16 26
so, 0 16 26
Fastiggi 0 16 26
and 0 16 26
Goldstein 0 16 26
contend. 0 16 26

Do 0 16 27
not 0 16 27
all 1 16 27
those 1 16 27
ignorant 1 16 27
critics 1 16 27
of 1 16 27
AL 1 16 27
know 0 16 27
that 0 16 27
the 0 16 27
Latin 0 16 27
text 0 16 27
employs 0 16 27
the 0 16 27
phrase 0 16 27
“obiectivum 0 16 27
exemplar,” 0 16 27
which, 0 16 27
translated 0 16 27
literally 0 16 27
into 0 16 27
English 0 16 27
is 0 16 27
“objective 0 16 27
exemplar.” 0 16 27
They 0 16 27
declare 0 16 27
triumphantly: 0 16 27
“The 0 16 27
Latin 0 16 27
term 0 16 27
exemplar 0 16 27
does 0 16 27
not 0 16 27
mean 0 16 27
an 0 16 27
unattainable 0 16 27
ideal, 0 16 27
it 0 16 27
specifically 0 16 27
means 0 16 27
a 0 16 27
pattern 0 16 27
or 0 16 27
model 0 16 27
to 0 16 27
follow.” 0 16 27

Give. 0 16 28

Me. 0 16 29

A. 0 16 30

Break. 0 16 31

A 0 16 32
pattern 0 16 32
or 0 16 32
model 0 16 32
to 0 16 32
follow 0 16 32
is 0 16 32
an 0 16 32
ideal, 0 16 32
as 0 16 32
a 0 16 32
standard 0 16 32
Latin 0 16 32
dictionary 0 16 32
confirms 0 16 32
with 0 16 32
its 0 16 32
definition 0 16 32
of 0 16 32
exemplar: 0 16 32
“(1) 0 16 32
copy/reproduction, 0 16 32
(2) 0 16 32
model, 0 16 32
pattern, 0 16 32
example, 0 16 32
original, 0 16 32
ideal. 0 16 32

Likewise, 0 16 33
the 0 16 33
definition 0 16 33
of 0 16 33
the 0 16 33
English 0 16 33
word 0 16 33
“exemplar” 0 16 33
is 0 16 33
simply: 0 16 33
“an 0 16 33
ideal 0 16 33
model.” 0 16 33

Here 0 16 34
too 0 16 34
Fastiggi 0 16 34
and 0 16 34
Goldsetein 0 16 34
only 0 16 34
worsen 0 16 34
the 0 16 34
problem 0 16 34
they 0 16 34
try 0 16 34
to 0 16 34
explain 0 16 34

away. 0 16 35
For 0 16 35
if 0 16 35
moral 0 16 35
behavior 0 16 35
is 0 16 35
now 0 16 35
to 0 16 35
be 0 16 35
viewed 0 16 35
as 0 16 35
merely 0 16 35
“exemplary” 0 16 35
rather 0 16 35
than 0 16 35
divinely 0 16 35
mandated 0 16 35
by 0 16 35
the 0 16 35
natural 0 16 35
law 0 16 35
that 0 16 35
binds 0 16 35
all 0 16 35
men—including 0 16 35
Thou 0 16 35
Shalt 0 16 35
Not 0 16 35
Commit 0 16 35
Adultery—then 0 16 35
basic 0 16 35
morality 0 16 35
becomes 0 16 35
a 0 16 35
kind 0 16 35
of 0 16 35
heroic 0 16 35
virtue. 0 16 35

Thus, 0 16 36
continence 0 16 36
cannot 0 16 36
realistically 0 16 36
be 0 16 36
expected, 0 16 36
at 0 16 36
least 0 16 36
“for 0 16 36
now” 0 16 36
(AL 0 16 36
303), 0 16 36
of 0 16 36
the 0 16 36
average 0 16 36
Joe 0 16 36
or 0 16 36
Jane 0 16 36
with 0 16 36
an 0 16 36
“ex” 0 16 36
who 0 16 36
has 0 16 36
“remarried” 0 16 36
and 0 16 36
is 0 16 36
now 0 16 36
mired 0 16 36
in 0 16 36
the 0 16 36
“concrete 0 16 36
complexity 0 16 36
one’s 0 16 36
limits.” 0 16 36

So, 0 16 37
as 0 16 37
Fastiggi 0 16 37
and 0 16 37
Goldstein 0 16 37
would 0 16 37
have 0 16 37
it, 0 16 37
all 1 16 37
the 1 16 37
tumult 1 16 37
triggered 1 16 37
by 1 16 37
AL 1 16 37
is 1 16 37
just 1 16 37
a 1 16 37
misunderstanding 1 16 37
caused 1 16 37
by 1 16 37
uninformed 1 16 37
people 1 16 37
who 1 16 37
haven’t 1 16 37
consulted 1 16 37
the 1 16 37
Latin 1 16 37

those 1 16 37

What 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
Pope 0 16 38

is 0 16 38
that 0 16 38
objectively 0 16 38
immoral 0 16 38
behavior 0 16 38
one 0 16 38
feels 0 16 38

correct 0 16 38
due 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
one’s 0 16 38

Which 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
what 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
official 0 16 38
English 0 16 38
translation 0 16 38
already 0 16 38
says 0 16 38
but 0 16 38
with 0 16 38
fewer 0 16 38

words. 0 16 39
It 0 16 39
seems 0 16 39
Fastiggi 0 16 39
and 0 16 39
Goldstein 0 16 39
are 0 16 39
hoping 0 16 39
no 0 16 39
one 0 16 39
will 0 16 39
notice 0 16 39
that 0 16 39
their 0 16 39
linguistic 0 16 39
tinkering 0 16 39
produces 0 16 39
no 0 16 39
real 0 16 39
change 0 16 39
in 0 16 39
meaning 0 16 39
but 0 16 39
only 0 16 39
an 0 16 39
intensification 0 16 39
of 0 16 39
its 0 16 39
perniciousness. 0 16 39

Indeed, 0 16 40
their 0 16 40
“proposed 0 16 40
alternate 0 16 40
translation” 0 16 40
reduces 0 16 40
the 0 16 40
avoidance 0 16 40
of 0 16 40
adulterous 0 16 40
relations 0 16 40
in 0 16 40
“second 0 16 40
marriages” 0 16 40
to 0 16 40
the 0 16 40
“perfect 0 16 40
objective 0 16 40
model.” 0 16 40
Now, 0 16 40
how 0 16 40
could 0 16 40
anyone 0 16 40
but 0 16 40
a 0 16 40
Pharisee 0 16 40
expect 0 16 40
perfection 0 16 40
from 0 16 40
people 0 16 40
living 0 16 40
in 0 16 40
adultery? 0 16 40

Are 0 16 41
you 0 16 41

perfect? 0 16 42
Then 0 16 42
again, 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
Pharisees 0 16 42
are 0 16 42
precisely 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
ones 0 16 42
Our 0 16 42
Lord 0 16 42
condemned 0 16 42
for 0 16 42
accommodating 0 16 42
divorce 0 16 42
and 0 16 42
remarriage 0 16 42
in 0 16 42
violation 0 16 42
of 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
natural 0 16 42

law. 0 16 43
But 1 16 43
such 1 16 43
embarrassing 1 16 43
truths 1 16 43
need 1 16 43
not 1 16 43
impede 1 16 43
the 1 16 43
Bergoglian 1 16 43
Mercy 1 16 43
Train 1 16 43
as 1 16 43
it 1 16 43
barrels 1 16 43
toward 1 16 43
a 1 16 43
train 1 16 43
wreck 1 16 43
at 1 16 43
the 1 16 43
end 1 16 43
of 1 16 43
the 1 16 43

line. 1 16 44
And 0 16 44
Fastiggi 0 16 44
and 0 16 44
Goldstein 0 16 44
are 0 16 44
busily 0 16 44
helping 0 16 44
it 0 16 44
along, 0 16 44
changing 0 16 44
red 0 16 44
signals 0 16 44
to 0 16 44

green. 0 16 45
No 0 16 45
problem 0 16 45

here! 0 16 46
has 0 16 46
been 0 16 46
the 0 16 46
mantra 0 16 46
of 0 16 46
the 0 16 46
neo-Catholic 0 16 46
establishment 0 16 46
for 0 16 46
nearly 0 16 46
half 0 16 46
a 0 16 46
century 0 16 46
of 0 16 46
ecclesial 0 16 46
auto-demolition. 0 16 46

But 1 16 47
wait, 1 16 47
there’s 1 16 47

more! 1 16 48
Our 1 16 48
dynamic 1 16 48
translators 1 16 48
even 0 16 48
provide 0 16 48
their 0 16 48
own 0 16 48
dynamic 0 16 48
interpretation 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
AL 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
mean 0 16 48
that 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
“offering” 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
God 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
Francis 0 16 48
speaks 0 16 48
is 0 16 48
merely 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
decision 0 16 48
by 0 16 48
a 0 16 48
divorced 0 16 48
and 0 16 48
“remarried” 0 16 48
couple 0 16 48
with 0 16 48
children 0 16 48
not 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
end 0 16 48
their 0 16 48
relationship, 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
would 0 16 48
be 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
“perfect 0 16 48
objective 0 16 48
model,” 0 16 48
but 0 16 48
rather 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
“live 0 16 48
in 0 16 48
continence 0 16 48
until 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
may—after 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
hoped 0 16 48
for 0 16 48
declaration 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
nullity—enter 0 16 48
into 0 16 48
a 0 16 48
true 0 16 48
marriage.” 0 16 48
That 0 16 48
is, 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
would 0 16 48
have 0 16 48
Francis 0 16 48
affirming 0 16 48
John 0 16 48
Paul 0 16 48
II’s 0 16 48
Familiaris 0 16 48
consortio, 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
repeats 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
Church’s 0 16 48
constant 0 16 48
teaching 0 16 48
that 0 16 48
continence 0 16 48
is 0 16 48
required 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
those 0 16 48
who 0 16 48
have 0 16 48
entered 0 16 48
into 0 16 48
adulterous 0 16 48
“second 0 16 48
marriage,” 0 16 48
failing 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
cannot 0 16 48
be 0 16 48
admitted 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
sacraments. 0 16 48

But 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
Fastiggi-Goldstein 0 16 49
interpretation 0 16 49
is 0 16 49
precisely 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
contrary 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
interpretation 0 16 49
Francis 0 16 49
has 0 16 49
assiduously 0 16 49
promoted 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
which 0 16 49
Fastiggi 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
Goldstein 0 16 49
just 0 16 49
as 0 16 49
assiduously 0 16 49
ignore: 0 16 49
i.e., 0 16 49
that 0 16 49
people 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
“second 0 16 49
marriages” 0 16 49
do 0 16 49
not 0 16 49
have 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
live 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
continence, 0 16 49
but 0 16 49
rather—in 0 16 49
“certain 0 16 49
cases”—may 0 16 49
continue 0 16 49
their 0 16 49
adulterous 0 16 49
relations 0 16 49
while 0 16 49
receiving 0 16 49
absolution 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
Holy 0 16 49
Communion 0 16 49
during 0 16 49
a 0 16 49
“process 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
discernment.” 0 16 49
As 0 16 49
we 0 16 49
know, 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
his 0 16 49
letter 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
bishops 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
Buenos 0 16 49
Aires, 0 16 49
published 0 16 49
on 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
Vatican 0 16 49
website 0 16 49
(in 0 16 49
response 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
a 0 16 49
query 0 16 49
he 0 16 49
himself 0 16 49
may 0 16 49
have 0 16 49
solicited), 0 16 49
Bergoglio 0 16 49
informed 0 16 49
them 0 16 49
“there 0 16 49
is 0 16 49
no 0 16 49

Moreover, 0 16 50
the 0 16 50

Romano—for 0 16 50
which 0 16 50

them—declare 0 16 50

thus: 0 16 51
If, 0 16 51
as 0 16 51
a 0 16 51
result 0 16 51
of 0 16 51
the 0 16 51
process 0 16 51
of 0 16 51

undertaken 0 16 51
with 0 16 51
“humility, 0 16 51

a 0 16 51
more 0 16 51
perfect 0 16 51
response 0 16 51
to 0 16 51
it” 0 16 51
(AL 0 16 51

with 0 16 51
an 0 16 51
informed 0 16 51

enlightened 0 16 51
conscience, 0 16 51
to 0 16 51
acknowledge 0 16 51

believe 0 16 51
that 0 16 51
he 0 16 51

she 0 16 51
are 0 16 51
at 0 16 51

with 0 16 51
God, 0 16 51
he 0 16 51

and 0 16 52

This 0 16 52
Pope’s 0 16 52
plan 0 16 52
of 0 16 52
promulgating 0 16 52
a 0 16 52
deliberately 0 16 52
ambiguous 0 16 52
document 0 16 52
whose 0 16 52
heterodox 0 16 52
interpretation 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
application 0 16 52
he 0 16 52
would 0 16 52
later 0 16 52
approve 0 16 52
with 0 16 52
a 0 16 52
series 0 16 52
of 0 16 52
sub-magisterial 0 16 52
winks 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
nods, 0 16 52
both 0 16 52
oral 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
written, 0 16 52
is 0 16 52
the 0 16 52
reason 0 16 52
I 0 16 52
signed 0 16 52
onto 0 16 52
the 0 16 52
Correctio 0 16 52

Filialis. 0 16 53
See 0 16 53
the 0 16 53
piece 0 16 53
by 0 16 53
Joseph 0 16 53
Shaw 0 16 53
in 0 16 53
this 0 16 53

regard. 0 16 54
Shaw 0 16 54
maintains 0 16 54
that 0 16 54
AL 0 16 54
can 0 16 54
be 0 16 54
“bent 0 16 54
into 0 16 54
some 0 16 54
kind 0 16 54
of 0 16 54
orthodoxy.” 0 16 54

Perhaps. 0 16 55
But 0 16 55
it 0 16 55
is 0 16 55
not 0 16 55
our 0 16 55
responsibility 0 16 55
to 0 16 55
bend 0 16 55
a 0 16 55
Pope’s 0 16 55
statements 0 16 55
into 0 16 55
conformity 0 16 55
with 0 16 55

the 0 16 56
Faith. 0 16 56
Moreover, 0 16 56
any 0 16 56
Pope 0 16 56
who 0 16 56
promulgates 0 16 56
a 0 16 56
document 0 16 56
that 0 16 56
can 0 16 56
be 0 16 56
read 0 16 56
as 0 16 56
orthodox 0 16 56
only 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
a 0 16 56
forced 0 16 56
interpretation 0 16 56
imposed 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
certain 0 16 56
readers—while 0 16 56
others 0 16 56
disagree—has 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
that 0 16 56
very 0 16 56
fact 0 16 56
inflicted 0 16 56
grave 0 16 56
harm 0 16 56
upon 0 16 56
on 0 16 56
the 0 16 56
Church, 0 16 56
which 0 16 56
he 0 16 56
alone 0 16 56
has 0 16 56
the 0 16 56
duty 0 16 56

to 0 16 57
correct. 0 16 57
But 0 16 57
Francis, 0 16 57
as 0 16 57
any 0 16 57
reasonable 0 16 57
observer 0 16 57
can 0 16 57
see, 0 16 57
has 0 16 57
no 0 16 57
intention 0 16 57
of 0 16 57
offering 0 16 57
any 0 16 57
such 0 16 57

correction. 0 16 58
Quite 0 16 58
to 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
contrary, 0 16 58
confusion 0 16 58
as 0 16 58
a 0 16 58
cover 0 16 58
for 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
introduction 0 16 58
of 0 16 58
Holy 0 16 58
Communion 0 16 58
for 1 16 58
“certain” 1 16 58
public 1 16 58
adulterers 1 16 58
by 0 16 58
Bergoglio’s 0 16 58
co-conspirators 0 16 58
in 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
Vatican 0 16 58
and 0 16 58
various 0 16 58
dioceses 0 16 58
is 0 16 58
exactly 0 16 58
what 0 16 58
he 0 16 58
was 0 16 58
aiming 0 16 58
to 0 16 58
achieve 0 16 58
from 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
beginning 0 16 58
of 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
whole 0 16 58
synodal 1 16 58
charade, 1 16 58
which 0 16 58
was 0 16 58
merely 0 16 58
a 0 16 58
vehicle 0 16 58
for 0 16 58
promulgation 0 16 58

of 0 16 59
AL. 0 16 59
As 0 16 59
Shaw 0 16 59
observes 0 16 59
of 0 16 59
AL: 0 16 59
“What 0 16 59
we 0 16 59
[the 0 16 59
signers 0 16 59
of 0 16 59
the 0 16 59
Correctio] 0 16 59
are 0 16 59
saying 0 16 59
is 0 16 59
that 0 16 59
it 0 16 59
has 0 16 59
become 0 16 59
clear 0 16 59
that 0 16 59
orthodoxy 0 16 59
is 0 16 59
not 0 16 59
what 0 16 59
Pope 0 16 59
Francis 0 16 59
wants 0 16 59
us 0 16 59
to 0 16 59

find 0 16 60
there.” 0 16 60
In 1 16 60
a 1 16 60
sense, 1 16 60
what 1 16 60
Bergoglio 1 16 60
is 1 16 60
doing 1 16 60
is 1 16 60
worse 1 16 60
than 1 16 60
explicit 1 16 60
heresy, 1 16 60
which 0 16 60
could 0 16 60
at 0 16 60
least 0 16 60
be 0 16 60
readily 0 16 60
identified 0 16 60
and 0 16 60
denounced 0 16 60

as 0 16 61
such. 0 16 61
But 0 16 61
Bergoglio 0 16 61
wants 0 16 61
the 0 16 61
effects 0 16 61
of 0 16 61
heresy—undermining 0 16 61
Holy 0 16 61
Matrimony, 0 16 61
Confession 0 16 61

affirmed 0 16 61
verbally—without 0 16 61
the 0 16 61

of 0 16 61
an 0 16 61

In 0 16 62
so 0 16 62
acting, 0 16 62
he 0 16 62
is 0 16 62
very 0 16 62
much 0 16 62
in 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
mold 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
Honorius 0 16 62
I, 0 16 62
who 0 16 62
was 0 16 62
posthumously 0 16 62
anathematized 0 16 62
by 0 16 62
an 0 16 62
ecumenical 0 16 62
council 0 16 62
(the 0 16 62
Third 0 16 62
Council 0 16 62

and 0 16 62
by 0 16 62
his 0 16 62
own 0 16 62
successor 0 16 62
(Leo 0 16 62

for 0 16 62

the 0 16 62
spread 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
Monothelite 0 16 62

(no 0 16 62
human 0 16 62

only 0 16 62
a 0 16 62
divine 0 16 62
will 0 16 62

in 0 16 63
Christ). 0 16 63
Honorius 0 16 63
did 0 16 63
so 0 16 63
by 0 16 63
means 0 16 63
of 0 16 63

the 0 16 63

endorsing 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
heresy 0 16 63
without 0 16 63
ever 0 16 63
formally 0 16 63
proclaiming 0 16 63
it 0 16 63

as 0 16 64
doctrine. 0 16 64
And 0 16 64
yet 0 16 64
Honorius 0 16 64
I 0 16 64
is 0 16 64
listed 0 16 64

A 0 16 65
similar 0 16 65
judgment 0 16 65
might 0 16 65
well 0 16 65
befall 0 16 65
this 0 16 65

Meanwhile, 0 16 66
as 0 16 66
Fastiggi 0 16 66
and 0 16 66
Goldstein 0 16 66
labor 0 16 66
to 0 16 66

us 0 16 66
that 0 16 66
nothing 0 16 66
is 0 16 66
amiss 0 16 66
with 0 16 66
AL, 0 16 66
Pope 0 16 66
Bergoglio 0 16 66
is 0 16 66
sending 0 16 66
clear 0 16 66
signals 0 16 66
of 0 16 66
concern 0 16 66
about 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
rising 0 16 66
opposition 0 16 66
among 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
faithful 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
his 0 16 66
master 0 16 66
plan 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
subvert 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
Church 0 16 66
according 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
his 0 16 66
false 0 16 66
notion 0 16 66

of 0 16 67
mercy. 0 16 67
In 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
classic 0 16 67
power 0 16 67
move, 0 16 67
he 0 16 67
has 0 16 67
just 0 16 67
given 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
sop 0 16 67
to 0 16 67
Cardinal 0 16 67
Burke, 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
perceived 0 16 67
leader 0 16 67
of 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
opposition, 0 16 67
by 0 16 67
appointing 0 16 67
him 0 16 67
to 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
minor 0 16 67
position 0 16 67
on 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
Apostolic 0 16 67
Signatura—the 0 16 67
same 0 16 67
tribunal 0 16 67
from 0 16 67
which 0 16 67
Bergoglio 0 16 67
brutally 0 16 67
removed 0 16 67
him 0 16 67

as 0 16 68
Prefect. 0 16 68
And 0 16 68
this 0 16 68
after 0 16 68
also 0 16 68
humiliating 0 16 68
Burke 0 16 68
as 0 16 68
the 0 16 68
spiritual 0 16 68
patron 0 16 68
of 0 16 68
the 0 16 68
Knights 0 16 68
of 0 16 68
Malta, 0 16 68
to 0 16 68
which 0 16 68
he 0 16 68
was 0 16 68
exiled 0 16 68
after 0 16 68

his 0 16 69
removal. 0 16 69
Will 0 16 69
this 0 16 69
sop 0 16 69
buy 0 16 69
Burke’s 0 16 69
silence, 0 16 69
staving 0 16 69
off 0 16 69
the 0 16 69
feared 0 16 69
public 0 16 69

correction? 0 16 70
We 0 16 70
will 0 16 70
soon 0 16 70
know 0 16 70
if 0 16 70
the 0 16 70
Cardinal 0 16 70
can 0 16 70
be 0 16 70
bought 0 16 70

so 0 16 71
easily. 0 16 71
But 0 16 71
this 0 16 71
move 0 16 71
demonstrates—if 0 16 71
more 0 16 71
evidence 0 16 71
were 0 16 71
needed—that 0 16 71
Bergoglio 0 16 71
has 0 16 71
never 0 16 71
been 0 16 71
the 1 16 71
humble 1 16 71
apostle 1 16 71
of 1 16 71
mercy 1 16 71
depicted 1 16 71
in 1 16 71

crafted 1 16 71

narrative, 1 16 71
but 1 16 71
rather 1 16 71
a 1 16 71
cunning 1 16 71
ecclesiastical 1 16 71
politician, 1 16 71
constantly 1 16 71

forward 0 29 1
to 0 29 1
reveal 0 29 1
that 0 29 1
there 0 29 1
was 0 29 1
an 0 29 1
active 0 29 1
shooter 0 29 1
inside 0 29 1
the 0 29 1
Bellagio 0 29 1
Hotel 0 29 1
around 0 29 1
the 0 29 1
same 0 29 1

that 0 29 1
supposed 0 29 1
lone 0 29 1

During 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
confessional, 0 29 2
a 0 29 2
Canadian 0 29 2
man 0 29 2
by 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
name 0 29 2
of 0 29 2
Jeff 0 29 2
detailed 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
fact 0 29 2
that 0 29 2
he 0 29 2
and 0 29 2
his 0 29 2
wife 0 29 2
were 0 29 2
in 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
Bellagio 0 29 2
Resort 0 29 2
and 0 29 2
Casino 0 29 2
around 0 29 2
11:20pm 0 29 2
on 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
night 0 29 2
of 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
shooting 0 29 2
when 0 29 2
panic 0 29 2
broke 0 29 2
out 0 29 2
in 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
hotels 0 29 2
lobby. 0 29 2

Jeff 0 29 3
begins 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
interview 0 29 3
by 0 29 3
making 0 29 3
clear 0 29 3
his 0 29 3
belief 0 29 3
that 0 29 3
there 0 29 3
were 0 29 3
multiple 0 29 3
active 0 29 3
shooters 0 29 3
targeting 0 29 3
different 0 29 3
places 0 29 3
in 0 29 3
Las 0 29 3
Vegas 0 29 3
on 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
night 0 29 3
of 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
attack. 0 29 3

“First 0 29 4
of 0 29 4
all, 0 29 4
I 0 29 4
think 0 29 4
what 0 29 4
needs 0 29 4
to 0 29 4
be 0 29 4
said 0 29 4
is 0 29 4
that, 0 29 4
from 0 29 4
my 0 29 4
perspective, 0 29 4
there 0 29 4
were 0 29 4
multiple 0 29 4
events 0 29 4
that 0 29 4
occurred 0 29 4
around 0 29 4
Las 0 29 4
Vegas, 0 29 4
up 0 29 4
and 0 29 4
down 0 29 4
the 0 29 4
Strip 0 29 4
that 0 29 4
night. 0 29 4

It 0 29 5
wasn’t 0 29 5
just 0 29 5
centralized 0 29 5
around 0 29 5
the 0 29 5
Mandalay 0 29 5
Hotel,” 0 29 5
the 0 29 5
witness 0 29 5
claimed. 0 29 5

The 0 29 6
eyewitness 0 29 6
then 0 29 6
goes 0 29 6
on 0 29 6
to 0 29 6
directly 0 29 6
say 0 29 6
that 0 29 6
he 0 29 6
and 0 29 6
his 0 29 6
wife 0 29 6
were 0 29 6
involved 0 29 6
in 0 29 6
an 0 29 6
active 0 29 6
shooter 0 29 6
situation 0 29 6
at 0 29 6
a 0 29 6
different 0 29 6
hotel 0 29 6
that 0 29 6
authorities 0 29 6
have 0 29 6
so 0 29 6
far 0 29 6
done 0 29 6
everything 0 29 6
in 0 29 6
their 0 29 6
power 0 29 6
to 0 29 6
cover-up. 0 29 6

“My 0 29 7
wife 0 29 7
and 0 29 7
I 0 29 7
were 0 29 7
in 0 29 7
Las 0 29 7
Vegas 0 29 7
celebrating 0 29 7
our 0 29 7
10th 0 29 7
anniversary 0 29 7
and 0 29 7
on 0 29 7
October 0 29 7
1st 0 29 7
we 0 29 7
were 0 29 7
involved 0 29 7
in 0 29 7
an 0 29 7
incident 0 29 7
with 0 29 7
an 0 29 7
active 0 29 7
shooter 0 29 7
at 0 29 7
the 0 29 7
Bellagio. 0 29 7

There 0 29 8
is 0 29 8
no 0 29 8
mistake 0 29 8
in 0 29 8
my 0 29 8
mind 0 29 8
about 0 29 8
it,” 0 29 8
he 0 29 8
continued. 0 29 8

Jeff 0 29 9
then 0 29 9
describes 0 29 9
a 0 29 9
scene 0 29 9
in 0 29 9
which 0 29 9
he 0 29 9
and 0 29 9
his 0 29 9
wife 0 29 9
were 0 29 9
walking 0 29 9
through 0 29 9
the 0 29 9
main 0 29 9
lobby 0 29 9
when 0 29 9
screams 0 29 9
and 0 29 9
gunfire 0 29 9
erupted. 0 29 9

Keep 1 29 10
in 1 29 10
mind, 1 29 10
this 1 29 10
is 1 29 10
all 1 29 10
information 1 29 10
that 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
police 1 29 10
and 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
FBI 1 29 10
has 1 29 10
hidden 1 29 10
from 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
American 1 29 10
people. 1 29 10

“All 0 29 11
of 0 29 11
a 0 29 11
sudden 0 29 11
there 0 29 11
was 0 29 11
just 0 29 11
a 0 29 11
crescendo 0 29 11
of 0 29 11
screams 0 29 11
that 0 29 11
started 0 29 11
behind 0 29 11
us 0 29 11
in 0 29 11
the 0 29 11
lobby,” 0 29 11
he 0 29 11
claimed. 0 29 11

“Then 0 29 12
I 0 29 12
heard 0 29 12
somebody 0 29 12
yell 0 29 12
‘there’s 0 29 12
a 0 29 12
shooter! 0 29 12

There’s 0 29 13
a 0 29 13
shooter!’ 0 29 13
And 0 29 13
then 0 29 13
I 0 29 13
heard 0 29 13
like 0 29 13
five 0 29 13
or 0 29 13
six 0 29 13
pops, 0 29 13
like 0 29 13
unmistakable 0 29 13
gunfire, 0 29 13
unmistakably.” 0 29 13

“That 0 29 14
was 0 29 14
about 0 29 14
11:20 0 29 14
when 0 29 14
we 0 29 14
heard 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
shots 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
screams… 0 29 14
at 0 29 14
that 0 29 14
point 0 29 14
you 0 29 14
could 0 29 14
hear 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
see 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
screams 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
see 0 29 14
hundreds 0 29 14
of 0 29 14
people 0 29 14
coming 0 29 14
towards 0 29 14
us.” 0 29 14

Amazingly, 0 29 15
as 0 29 15
Shepard 0 29 15
Ambellas 0 29 15
noted, 0 29 15
“The 0 29 15
man’s 0 29 15
claims 0 29 15
match 0 29 15
up 0 29 15
to 0 29 15
actual 0 29 15
events 0 29 15
captured 0 29 15
in 0 29 15
police 0 29 15
audio 0 29 15
recordings 0 29 15
from 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
night 0 29 15
of 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
shooting 0 29 15
which 0 29 15
confirms 0 29 15
that 0 29 15
between 0 29 15
11:15 0 29 15
and 0 29 15
11:18 0 29 15
p.m. 0 29 15
on 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
night 0 29 15
of 0 29 15
Oct. 0 29 15
1 0 29 15
there 0 29 15
was, 0 29 15
in 0 29 15
fact, 0 29 15
something 0 29 15
going 0 29 15
on 0 29 15
at 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
Bellagio.” 0 29 15

This 0 29 16
testimony 0 29 16
also 0 29 16
backs 0 29 16
up 0 29 16
claims 0 29 16
by 0 29 16
another 0 29 16
eyewitness, 0 29 16
Rene 0 29 16
Downs, 0 29 16
who 0 29 16
has 0 29 16
spent 0 29 16
the 0 29 16
past 0 29 16
few 0 29 16
days 0 29 16
doing 0 29 16
interviews 0 29 16
about 0 29 16
a 0 29 16
shooter 0 29 16
inside 0 29 16
the 0 29 16
Bellagio 0 29 16
Hotel. 0 29 16

Slowly 1 29 17
but 1 29 17
surely 1 29 17
we 0 29 17
are 0 29 17
starting 0 29 17
to 0 29 17
see 0 29 17
the 0 29 17
official 0 29 17
narrative 0 29 17
regarding 0 29 17
the 0 29 17
Las 0 29 17
Vegas 0 29 17
Massacre 0 29 17
be 0 29 17
completely 0 29 17
destroyed. 0 29 17

At 0 29 18
this 0 29 18
point 0 29 18
it 1 29 18
is 1 29 18
strikingly 1 29 18
obvious 1 29 18
that 1 29 18
authorities 1 29 18
have 1 29 18
lied 1 29 18
to 1 29 18
the 1 29 18
American 1 29 18
people 1 29 18
about 0 29 18
the 0 29 18
worst 0 29 18
mass 0 29 18
shooting 0 29 18
in 0 29 18
our 0 29 18
countries 0 29 18
history. 0 29 18

One 1 29 18

can 1 29 18

only 1 29 18

speculate 1 29 18

as 1 29 18

to 1 29 18

what 1 29 18

the 1 29 18

reasons 1 29 18

for 1 29 18

these 1 29 18

are? 1 29 18

"I 0 30 20
am 0 30 20

for 0 30 20
the 0 30 20
Jewish 0 30 20

I 0 30 21
was 0 30 21
raised 0 30 21

was 0 30 22

it 0 30 22
was 0 30 22

If 1 30 23
our 1 30 23

effectively 1 30 23
exclude 1 30 23
all 1 30 23

then 1 30 23
they 1 30 23

aspect 1 30 23
of 1 30 23
their 1 30 23
Jewishness." 1 30 23

Let's 0 30 24
unpack 0 30 24
this 0 30 24
knapsack 1 30 24
of 1 30 24
entitled 1 30 24
nonsense. 1 30 24

Anti-Israel 0 30 25
activists 0 30 25
like 0 30 25
Dan 0 30 25
Fishback 0 30 25
are 0 30 25
entitled 0 30 25
to 0 30 25
exploit 0 30 25
Jewish 0 30 25
spaces 0 30 25
for 0 30 25
their 0 30 25
propoaganda... 0 30 25
even 0 30 25
while 0 30 25
they 0 30 25
advocate 0 30 25
a 0 30 25
boycott 0 30 25

the 0 30 25
Jews 0 30 25

Israel. 0 30 25

Previously 0 30 26
Dan 0 30 26

an 0 30 26

Now 0 30 27
he's 0 30 27
whining 1 30 27
that 0 30 27
boycotting 0 30 27
his 0 30 27
play 0 30 27
is 0 30 27
a 0 30 27
violation 0 30 27
of 0 30 27
Jewishness 0 30 27
because 0 30 27
Jews 0 30 27
are 0 30 27

"people 0 30 27
of 0 30 27

But 0 30 28
the 0 30 28
only 0 30 28
dissent 0 30 28
and 0 30 28
argument 0 30 28
that 0 30 28

are 0 30 28
supposed 0 30 28
to 0 30 28

who 1 30 28
hate 1 30 28
the 1 30 28
existence 1 30 28
of 1 30 28
Jewish 1 30 28
nationhood. 1 30 28

Not 1 30 29
of 1 30 29

nationhood 1 30 29
itself. 1 30 29

"it’s 0 30 30
not 0 30 30

It's 0 30 31
not 0 30 31
that 0 30 31
boycotting 0 30 31

of 1 30 32
the 1 30 32
Jewish 1 30 32
people. 1 30 32

It's 0 30 33
time 0 30 33
for 0 30 33
the 0 30 33
#BDStears 0 30 33
crowd 0 30 33
to 0 30 33
examine 0 30 33
their 0 30 33

recognize 0 30 33
that 0 30 33
what's 0 30 33

Either 1 30 33

that 1 30 33

An 0 33 1
outbreak 0 33 1
of 0 33 1
the 0 33 1
plague 0 33 1
in 0 33 1
Madagascar 0 33 1
is 0 33 1
spreading 0 33 1
at 0 33 1
an 0 33 1
unprecedented 1 33 1
rate. 0 33 1

With 0 33 2
the 0 33 2
ease 0 33 2
of 0 33 2
spreading 0 33 2
the 0 33 2
plague, 0 33 2
the 1 33 2
likelihood 1 33 2
that 1 33 2
this 1 33 2
disease 1 33 2
will 1 33 2
move 1 33 2
to 1 33 2
other 1 33 2

regions 1 33 2

the 1 33 2
planet 1 33 2
has 1 33 2
become 1 33 2
a 1 33 2
huge 1 33 2
concern 1 33 2
for 1 33 2
many. 1 33 2

So 0 33 3
far, 0 33 3
the 0 33 3
plague 0 33 3
has 0 33 3
claimed 0 33 3
57 0 33 3
lives 0 33 3
and 0 33 3
infected 0 33 3
more 0 33 3
than 0 33 3
680 0 33 3
others. 0 33 3

These 0 33 4

are 0 33 4
from 0 33 4

however, 0 33 4
and 0 33 4
the 0 33 4
disease 0 33 4
is 0 33 4
spreading 0 33 4
rapidly. 0 33 4

An 0 33 5
estimated 0 33 5

of 0 33 5
these 0 33 5
cases 0 33 5
and 0 33 5
25 0 33 5
of 0 33 5

A 0 33 7

Of 0 33 8
Madagascar’s 0 33 8
114 0 33 8
districts, 0 33 8
35 0 33 8
have 0 33 8
reported 0 33 8
cases 0 33 8
of 0 33 8
plague, 0 33 8
including 0 33 8
at 0 33 8
least 0 33 8
10 0 33 8
cities. 0 33 8

Plague 0 33 9
is 0 33 9
caused 0 33 9
by 0 33 9
infection 0 33 9
with 0 33 9
the 0 33 9
bacterium 0 33 9
Yersinia 0 33 9
pestis 0 33 9
and 0 33 9
is 0 33 9
typically 0 33 9
spread 0 33 9
through 0 33 9
the 0 33 9
bite 0 33 9
of 0 33 9
infected 0 33 9
fleas, 0 33 9
frequently 0 33 9
carried 0 33 9
by 0 33 9
rats. 0 33 9

The 0 33 10
bacteria 0 33 10
will 0 33 10
eventually 0 33 10
end 0 33 10
up 0 33 10
causing 0 33 10
the 0 33 10
often 0 33 10
fatal 0 33 10
plague. 0 33 10

Symptoms 0 33 11
can 0 33 11
include 0 33 11
painful, 0 33 11
swollen 0 33 11
lymph 0 33 11
nodes, 0 33 11
called 0 33 11
buboes, 0 33 11
as 0 33 11
well 0 33 11
as 0 33 11
fever, 0 33 11
chills, 0 33 11
and 0 33 11
coughing. 0 33 11

Pneumonic 0 33 12
plague 0 33 12
is 0 33 12
more 0 33 12
virulent 0 33 12
or 0 33 12
damaging 0 33 12
and 0 33 12
is 0 33 12
an 0 33 12
advanced 0 33 12
form 0 33 12
of 0 33 12
the 0 33 12
disease 0 33 12
characterized 0 33 12
by 0 33 12
a 0 33 12
severe 0 33 12
lung 0 33 12
infection. 0 33 12

The 0 33 13
infection 0 33 13
can 0 33 13
be 0 33 13
transmitted 0 33 13
from 0 33 13
person 0 33 13
to 0 33 13
person 0 33 13
via 0 33 13
airborne 0 33 13
droplets 0 33 13
from 0 33 13
coughing 0 33 13
or 0 33 13
sneezing. 0 33 13

The 0 33 14
incubation 0 33 14
period 0 33 14
is 0 33 14
extremely 1 33 14
short 0 33 14
too, 0 33 14
and 0 33 14
an 0 33 14
infected 0 33 14
person 0 33 14
may 0 33 14
die 0 33 14
within 0 33 14

According 0 33 15
to 0 33 15
CNN, 0 33 15
the 0 33 15
cases 0 33 15
were 0 33 15
reported 0 33 15
by 0 33 15

They 0 33 16
include 0 33 16
probable 0 33 16
and 0 33 16
suspected 0 33 16
cases 0 33 16
as 0 33 16
well 0 33 16
those 0 33 16
that 0 33 16

been 0 33 16
confirmed 0 33 16
by 0 33 16

tests. 0 33 16

And 0 33 17
while 0 33 17
the 0 33 17
country 0 33 17
experiences 0 33 17
regular 0 33 17
outbreaks, 0 33 17
with 0 33 17
an 0 33 17
estimated 0 33 17
400 0 33 17
cases 0 33 17
of 0 33 17
plague 0 33 17
each 0 33 17
year, 0 33 17
this 0 33 17
time 0 33 17
things 0 33 17
are 0 33 17
very 0 33 17
different, 0 33 17
experts 0 33 17
warn. 0 33 17

This 0 33 18
year, 0 33 18
health 0 33 18
officials 0 33 18
report 0 33 18
the 0 33 18
infections 0 33 18
started 0 33 18
much 0 33 18
earlier 0 33 18
than 0 33 18
usual, 0 33 18
and 0 33 18
they’re 0 33 18
occurring 0 33 18
in 0 33 18
new 0 33 18
areas, 0 33 18
including 0 33 18
urban 0 33 18
settings. 0 33 18

They’ve 0 33 19
also 0 33 19
seen 0 33 19
an 0 33 19
unexpected 0 33 19
number 0 33 19
of 0 33 19
cases 0 33 19
of 0 33 19
pneumonic 0 33 19
plague, 0 33 19
which 0 33 19
transmits 0 33 19
more 0 33 19
easily 0 33 19
from 0 33 19
person 0 33 19
to 0 33 19
person. 0 33 19

Historically 0 33 20
dubbed 0 33 20
the 0 33 20
“black 1 33 20
death” 1 33 20
the 0 33 20
bubonic 0 33 20
plague 0 33 20
has 0 33 20
been 0 33 20
responsible 0 33 20
for 0 33 20
several 0 33 20
worldwide 0 33 20
pandemics 0 33 20
in 0 33 20
the 0 33 20
past. 0 33 20

Early 0 33 21
detection 0 33 21
of 0 33 21
the 0 33 21
plague 0 33 21
is 0 33 21
key 0 33 21
since 0 33 21
both 0 33 21
forms 0 33 21
of 0 33 21
it 0 33 21
can 0 33 21
be 0 33 21
cured 0 33 21
with 0 33 21
antibiotics. 0 33 21

But, 0 33 22
occasionally 0 33 22
there 0 33 22
can 0 33 22
be 0 33 22
cases 0 33 22
of 0 33 22
septicemic 0 33 22
plague, 0 33 22
where 0 33 22
the 0 33 22
infection 0 33 22
has 0 33 22
spread 0 33 22
to 0 33 22
a 0 33 22
person’s 0 33 22
bloodstream 0 33 22
and 0 33 22
can 0 33 22
cause 0 33 22
bleeding 0 33 22
and 0 33 22

have 0 39 2
been 0 39 2
very 0 39 2

minds. 0 39 2

As 0 39 3
their 0 39 3
U.S. 0 39 3

watched, 0 39 3
the 0 39 3
Kurdish 0 39 3

were 0 39 3
run 0 39 3

all 0 39 3

captured 0 39 3

Iran 0 39 6

had 0 39 6
warned 0 39 6

an 0 39 6

But 0 39 7
the 0 39 7

More 0 39 9

for 0 39 9

appears 0 39 10
to 0 39 10
be 0 39 10
as 0 39 10
close 0 39 10
to 0 39 10
Iran 0 39 10

a 0 39 11

our 0 39 11
15-year 0 39 11
war 0 39 11
in 0 39 11
Iraq 0 39 11
could 0 39 11
end 0 39 11
with 0 39 11
a 0 39 11
Shiite-dominated 0 39 11
Baghdad 0 39 11

With 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
grim 0 39 12
prospect 0 39 12
in 0 39 12
mind, 0 39 12
Secretary 0 39 12
Rex 0 39 12
Tillerson 0 39 12
said 0 39 12
Sunday 0 39 12
, 0 39 12
"Iranian 0 39 12
militias 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
are 0 39 12
in 0 39 12
Iraq, 0 39 12
now 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
the 0 39 12
fight 0 39 12
against 0 39 12

Any 0 39 13
foreign 0 39 13

in 0 39 13
Iraq 0 39 13
need 0 39 13
to 0 39 13

Tillerson 0 39 14
meant 0 39 14
Iran's 0 39 14
Quds 0 39 14
Force 0 39 14
in 0 39 14
Iraq 0 39 14
should 0 39 14
go 0 39 14
home, 0 39 14
and 0 39 14
the 0 39 14
Shiite 0 39 14
militia 0 39 14
in 0 39 14
Iraq 0 39 14
should 0 39 14
be 0 39 14
conscripted 0 39 14
into 0 39 14
the 0 39 14
army. 0 39 14

But 1 39 15
what 1 39 15
if 1 39 15
the 1 39 15
Baghdad 1 39 15
regime 1 39 15
of 1 39 15
Haider 1 39 15
al-Abadi 1 39 15
does 1 39 15
not 1 39 15
agree? 1 39 15

What 1 39 16
if 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Quds 1 39 16
Force 1 39 16
does 1 39 16
not 1 39 16
go 1 39 16
home 1 39 16
to 1 39 16
Iran 1 39 16
and 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Shiite 1 39 16
militias 1 39 16
that 1 39 16

enlist 1 39 16
in 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Iraqi 1 39 16
army? 1 39 16

Who 0 39 17
then 0 39 17
enforces 0 39 17
Tillerson's 0 39 17
demands? 0 39 17

Consider 0 39 18
what 0 39 18
is 0 39 18
happening 0 39 18
in 0 39 18
Syria. 0 39 18

The 0 39 19
U.S.-backed 0 39 19
Syrian 0 39 19
Democratic 0 39 19
Forces, 0 39 19
largely 0 39 19
Kurdish, 0 39 19
just 0 39 19
annihilated 0 39 19
ISIS 0 39 19
in 0 39 19
Raqqa 0 39 19
and 0 39 19
drove 0 39 19
60 0 39 19
miles 0 39 19
to 0 39 19
seize 0 39 19

field, 0 39 19
al-Omar, 0 39 19
from 0 39 19

The 0 39 20
race 0 39 20
is 0 39 20
now 0 39 20
on 0 39 20
between 0 39 20
the 0 39 20
SDF 0 39 20
and 0 39 20
Bashar 0 39 20
Assad's 0 39 20
army 0 39 20
to 0 39 20
secure 0 39 20
the 0 39 20
border 0 39 20
with 0 39 20
Iraq. 0 39 20

Bottom 0 39 21
line: 0 39 21
The 0 39 21
U.S. 0 39 21
goal 0 39 21
of 0 39 21
crushing 0 39 21
the 0 39 21
ISIS 0 39 21
caliphate 0 39 21
is 0 39 21
almost 0 39 21
attained. 0 39 21

But 0 39 22
if 0 39 22
our 0 39 22
victory 0 39 22
in 0 39 22
the 0 39 22
war 0 39 22
against 0 39 22
ISIS 0 39 22

in 0 39 22
Baghdad 0 39 22

to 0 39 22
Baghdad, 0 39 22
Damascus 0 39 22

Beirut 0 39 22
secure, 1 39 22
is 1 39 22
that 1 39 22
really 1 39 22
a 1 39 22
victory? 1 39 22

Do 1 39 23
we 1 39 23
accept 1 39 23
that 1 39 23
outcome, 1 39 23
pack 1 39 23
up 1 39 23
and 1 39 23
go 1 39 23
home? 1 39 23

Or 1 39 24
do 1 39 24
we 1 39 24
leave 1 39 24
our 1 39 24
forces 1 39 24
in 1 39 24
Syria 1 39 24
and 1 39 24
Iraq 1 39 24
and 1 39 24
defy 1 39 24
any 1 39 24
demand 1 39 24
from 1 39 24
Assad 1 39 24
to 1 39 24
vacate 1 39 24

Sunday's 0 39 25
editorial 0 39 25
in 0 39 25
The 0 39 25

"The 0 39 25
Next 0 39 25
Mideast 0 39 25
Wars," 0 39 25
raises 0 39 25
the 0 39 25
crucial 0 39 25
questions 0 39 25
now 0 39 25
before 0 39 25
us. 0 39 25

Would 0 39 26
President 0 39 26
Trump 0 39 26
be 0 39 26
willing 0 39 26
to 0 39 26
fight 0 39 26
a 0 39 26
new 0 39 26
war 0 39 26
to 0 39 26
keep 0 39 26
Iran 0 39 26
from 0 39 26
consolidating 0 39 26
its 0 39 26
position 0 39 26
in 0 39 26
Iraq 0 39 26
and 0 39 26
Syria? 0 39 26

Would 1 39 27
the 1 39 27
American 1 39 27
people 1 39 27
support 1 39 27
such 1 39 27
a 1 39 27
war 1 39 27
with 1 39 27
U.S. 1 39 27
troops? 1 39 27

Would 0 39 28
Congress, 0 39 28
apparently 1 39 28
clueless 1 39 28
to 1 39 28
the 1 39 28
presence 1 39 28
of 1 39 28
800 1 39 28
U.S. 1 39 28
troops 1 39 28
in 1 39 28
Niger, 1 39 28
authorize 0 39 28
a 0 39 28
new 0 39 28
U.S. 0 39 28
war 0 39 28
in 0 39 28
Syria 0 39 28
or 0 39 28
Iraq? 0 39 28

If 0 39 29
Trump 0 39 29
and 0 39 29
his 0 39 29
generals 0 39 29
felt 0 39 29
our 0 39 29
vital 0 39 29
interests 0 39 29
could 0 39 29
not 0 39 29
allow 0 39 29
Syria 0 39 29
and 0 39 29
Iraq 0 39 29
to 0 39 29
drift 0 39 29
into 0 39 29
the 0 39 29
orbit 0 39 29
of 0 39 29
Iran, 0 39 29
where 0 39 29
would 0 39 29
we 0 39 29
find 0 39 29
allies 0 39 29
for 0 39 29
such 0 39 29
a 0 39 29
fight? 0 39 29

If 1 39 30
we 1 39 30
rely 1 39 30
on 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
Kurds 1 39 30
in 1 39 30
Syria, 1 39 30
we 1 39 30
lose 1 39 30
NATO 1 39 30
ally 1 39 30
Turkey, 1 39 30
which 1 39 30
regards 1 39 30
Syria's 1 39 30
Kurds 1 39 30
as 1 39 30
collaborators 1 39 30
of 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
PKK 1 39 30
in 1 39 30
Turkey, 1 39 30
which 1 39 30
even 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
U.S. 1 39 30
designates 1 39 30
a 1 39 30
terrorist 1 39 30
organization. 1 39 30

The 0 39 31
decision 0 39 31
as 0 39 31
to 0 39 31
whether 0 39 31
this 0 39 31
country 0 39 31
should 0 39 31
engage 0 39 31
in 0 39 31
new 0 39 31
post-ISIS 0 39 31
wars 0 39 31
in 0 39 31
the 0 39 31
Mideast, 0 39 31
however, 0 39 31
may 0 39 31
be 0 39 31
taken 0 39 31
out 0 39 31
of 0 39 31
our 0 39 31
hands. 0 39 31

Saturday, 0 39 32
Israel 0 39 32
launched 0 39 32
new 0 39 32
air 0 39 32
strikes 0 39 32
against 0 39 32
gun 0 39 32
positions 0 39 32
in 0 39 32
Syria 0 39 32
in 0 39 32
retaliation 0 39 32
for 0 39 32
shells 0 39 32
fired 0 39 32
into 0 39 32
the 0 39 32
Golan 0 39 32
Heights. 0 39 32

Damascus 0 39 33
claims 0 39 33
that 0 39 33
Israel's 0 39 33
"terrorist" 1 39 33
allies 0 39 33
inside 0 39 33
Syria 0 39 33
fired 0 39 33
the 0 39 33
shells, 0 39 33
to 0 39 33
give 0 39 33
the 0 39 33
IDF 0 39 33
an 0 39 33
excuse 0 39 33
to 0 39 33
attack. 0 39 33

Why 0 39 34
would 0 39 34
Israel 0 39 34
wish 0 39 34
to 0 39 34
provoke 0 39 34
a 0 39 34
war 0 39 34
with 0 39 34
Syria? 0 39 34

Because 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
Israelis 0 39 35

and 0 59 3
the 0 59 3
illegal 0 59 3

However, 0 59 4
the 0 59 4
Department 0 59 4
of 0 59 4
Homeland 0 59 4
Security 0 59 4
(DHS) 0 59 4
declined 0 59 4

orders, 0 59 4
called 0 59 4
Final 0 59 4
Order 0 59 4
Of 0 59 4
Removal 0 59 4

During 0 59 5
the 0 59 5
10 0 59 5
or 0 59 5
so 0 59 5
years 0 59 5
that 0 59 5
the 0 59 5
cases 0 59 5
involving 0 59 5
Indonesian 0 59 5
Christians 0 59 5
were 0 59 5
free 0 59 5
to 0 59 5
remain 0 59 5
in 0 59 5
the 0 59 5
United 0 59 5
States, 0 59 5
those 0 59 5
illegal 0 59 5
aliens 0 59 5
did 0 59 5
not 0 59 5
make 0 59 5
any 0 59 5
effort 0 59 5
to 0 59 5
appeal 0 59 5
their 0 59 5
outstanding 0 59 5
orders. 0 59 5

Then 0 59 6
the 0 59 6
United 0 59 6
States 0 59 6
had 0 59 6
an 0 59 6
election, 0 59 6
and 0 59 6
the 0 59 6
policy 0 59 6
of 0 59 6
not 0 59 6
enforcing 0 59 6
those 0 59 6
and 0 59 6
many 0 59 6
other 0 59 6
Final 0 59 6
Orders 0 59 6
of 0 59 6
Removal 0 59 6
was 0 59 6
ended. 0 59 6

Then 0 59 7
suddenly, 0 59 7
those 0 59 7
illegal 1 59 7
aliens 1 59 7
claimed 0 59 7
they 0 59 7

a 0 59 8

in 0 59 8
the 0 59 8
Federal 0 59 8

First, 0 59 15
let's 0 59 15
deal 0 59 15
with 0 59 15
the 0 59 15
misleading 0 59 15
reporting. 0 59 15

Rombot 0 59 16
was 0 59 16
not 0 59 16
taken 0 59 16
into 0 59 16
custody 0 59 16
based 0 59 16
on 0 59 16
any 0 59 16
ICE 0 59 16
policy 0 59 16
of 0 59 16
deporting 0 59 16
all 0 59 16
illegal 1 59 16
aliens. 1 59 16

Rombot 0 59 17
was 0 59 17
taken 0 59 17
into 0 59 17
custody 0 59 17
because 0 59 17
he 0 59 17
had 0 59 17
an 0 59 17
outstanding 0 59 17
Final 0 59 17
Order 0 59 17
Of 0 59 17
Removal; 0 59 17
that's 1 59 17
a 1 59 17
big 1 59 17
difference 1 59 17
and 1 59 17
symptomatic 1 59 17
of 1 59 17
the 1 59 17
lies 1 59 17
from 1 59 17
reporters 1 59 17
like 1 59 17
Raymond. 1 59 17

Saris 0 59 18
previously 0 59 18
ordered 0 59 18
a 0 59 18
stay 0 59 18
to 0 59 18
the 0 59 18
deportations. 0 59 18

She 0 59 19
is 0 59 19
currently 0 59 19
weighing 0 59 19
whether 0 59 19
she 0 59 19
can 0 59 19
order 0 59 19
a 0 59 19
longer 0 59 19
delay 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
give 0 59 19
the 0 59 19
affected 0 59 19
people 0 59 19
time 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
renew 0 59 19
their 0 59 19
efforts 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
gain 0 59 19
legal 0 59 19
status. 0 59 19

Now, 0 59 20
with 0 59 20
regard 0 59 20
to 0 59 20
Saris, 0 59 20
she 0 59 20
has 0 59 20
no 0 59 20
authority 0 59 20
to 0 59 20
interfere 0 59 20
with 0 59 20
the 0 59 20
pre-deportation 0 59 20
custody 0 59 20
of 0 59 20
an 0 59 20
illegal 1 59 20
alien 1 59 20
with 0 59 20
a 0 59 20
Final 0 59 20
Order 0 59 20
Of 0 59 20
Removal. 0 59 20

Rombot 0 59 21
was 0 59 21
taken 0 59 21
into 0 59 21
custody 0 59 21
because 0 59 21
he 0 59 21
was 0 59 21
soon 0 59 21
to 0 59 21
be 0 59 21
deported. 0 59 21

There 0 59 22
was 0 59 22
no 0 59 22
issue 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
Indonesia 0 59 22
not 0 59 22
accepting 0 59 22
him 0 59 22
nor 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
Indonesia 0 59 22
not 0 59 22
providing 0 59 22
a 0 59 22
travel 0 59 22
document, 0 59 22
so 0 59 22
there 0 59 22
was 0 59 22
no 0 59 22
question 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
him 0 59 22
being 0 59 22
held 0 59 22
in 0 59 22
custody 0 59 22
longer 0 59 22
than 0 59 22
allowed 0 59 22
in 0 59 22
the 0 59 22
St. 0 59 22
Cyr 0 59 22
decision 0 59 22
that 0 59 22
restricted 0 59 22
custody 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
illegal 1 59 22
aliens 1 59 22
with 0 59 22
Final 0 59 22
Orders 0 59 22
Of 0 59 22
Removal 0 59 22
who 0 59 22
for 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
reason 0 59 22
were 0 59 22
unlikely 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
be 0 59 22
successfully 0 59 22
deported. 0 59 22

She 0 59 23
still 0 59 23
thinks 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
she 0 59 23
can 0 59 23
review 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
underlying 0 59 23
decision 0 59 23
of 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
immigration 0 59 23
court 0 59 23
as 0 59 23
well.In 0 59 23
fact, 0 59 23
Saris' 0 59 23
actions 0 59 23
appear 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
more 0 59 23
akin 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
of 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
Mexican 0 59 23
kritarch 0 59 23
Monica 0 59 23
Herranz 0 59 23
who 0 59 23
aided 0 59 23
an 0 59 23
illegal 1 59 23
alien 1 59 23
to 0 59 23
escape 0 59 23
arrest 0 59 23
by 0 59 23
ICE 0 59 23
when 0 59 23
she 0 59 23
let 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
illegal 1 59 23
alien 1 59 23
leave 0 59 23
her 0 59 23
courtroom 0 59 23
through 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
exit 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
her 0 59 23
judicial 0 59 23
chambers. 0 59 23

Saris 0 59 24
is 0 59 24
clearly 0 59 24
scheming 0 59 24
to 0 59 24
help 0 59 24

Wilson, 0 95 5
a 0 95 5
correspondent 0 95 5
for 0 95 5
the 0 95 5

has 0 95 5
posted 0 95 5
to 0 95 5
Twitter 0 95 5
a 0 95 5
year 0 95 5
by 0 95 5
year 0 95 5
breakdown 0 95 5
of 0 95 5
sexual 0 95 5

settlements 0 95 5
and 0 95 5
awards 0 95 5
that 0 95 5
he 0 95 5
received 0 95 5
from 0 95 5
the 0 95 5
Congressional 0 95 5
Office 0 95 5
of 0 95 5
Compliance. 0 95 5

I 0 95 6
went 0 95 6
ahead 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
added 0 95 6
up 0 95 6
each 0 95 6
column, 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
what 0 95 6
I 0 95 6
discovered 0 95 6
is 0 95 6
that 0 95 6
264 0 95 6
cases 0 95 6
of 0 95 6
sexual 0 95 6
harassment 0 95 6
in 0 95 6

have 0 95 6
been 0 95 6
settled 0 95 6
since 0 95 6
1997, 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
the 0 95 6
total 0 95 6
amount 0 95 6
awarded 0 95 6
in 0 95 6
those 0 95 6
settlements 0 95 6
comes 0 95 6
to 0 95 6
a 0 95 6
grand 0 95 6
total 0 95 6
of 0 95 6
$17,250,854. 0 95 6

So 0 95 7
where 0 95 7
has 0 95 7
the 0 95 7
$17,250,854 0 95 7
come 0 95 7
from 0 95 7
to 0 95 7
pay 0 95 7
those 0 95 7
settlements? 0 95 7

That 1 95 8
money 1 95 8
has 1 95 8
come 1 95 8
from 1 95 8
the 1 95 8
taxpayers 1 95 8
of 1 95 8
course. 1 95 8

That 0 95 9
means 0 95 9
that 0 95 9
you 0 95 9
and 0 95 9
I 0 95 9
have 0 95 9
been 0 95 9
paying 0 95 9
to 0 95 9
cover 0 95 9
up 0 95 9
the 1 95 9
epidemic 1 95 9
of 1 95 9

originally 0 95 10
told 0 95 10

that 0 95 10
more 0 95 10
than 0 95 10
15 0 95 10
million 0 95 10
dollars 0 95 10
had 0 95 10
been 0 95 10

out 0 95 10
to 0 95 10

in 0 95 10
recent 0 95 10

I 0 95 10
was 0 95 10

few 0 95 10
dozen 0 95 10
cases 0 95 10
at 0 95 10
most. 0 95 10

I 0 95 11
had 0 95 11
no 0 95 11
idea 0 95 11
that 0 95 11
the 0 95 11
total 0 95 11
number 0 95 11
of 0 95 11
cases 0 95 11
would 0 95 11
actually 0 95 11
be 0 95 11
well 0 95 11
over 0 95 11
200. 0 95 11

If 0 95 12
our 0 95 12
leaders 0 95 12
were 0 95 12
serious 0 95 12
about 0 95 12
stopping 0 95 12
this 0 95 12
from 0 95 12
happening, 0 95 12
they 0 95 12
would 0 95 12
pass 0 95 12
a 0 95 12
law 0 95 12
making 0 95 12
it 0 95 12
mandatory 0 95 12
that 0 95 12
all 0 95 12
cases 0 95 12
of 0 95 12
sexual 0 95 12
harassment 0 95 12
in 0 95 12
Congress 0 95 12
be 0 95 12
made 0 95 12
public, 0 95 12
and 0 95 12
that 0 95 12
members 0 95 12
of 0 95 12
Congress 0 95 12
would 0 95 12
be 0 95 12
personally 0 95 12
responsible 0 95 12
for 0 95 12
paying 0 95 12
out 0 95 12
any 0 95 12
settlements. 0 95 12

If 1 95 13
such 1 95 13
a 1 95 13
law 1 95 13
was 1 95 13
instituted, 1 95 13
I 1 95 13
guarantee 1 95 13
you 1 95 13
that 1 95 13
sexual 1 95 13
harassment 1 95 13
on 1 95 13
Capitol 1 95 13
Hill 1 95 13
would 1 95 13
come 1 95 13
to 1 95 13
a 1 95 13
screeching 1 95 13
halt. 1 95 13

But 0 95 14
they 0 95 14
don’t 0 95 14
want 0 95 14
it 0 95 14
to 0 95 14
stop. 0 95 14

For 1 95 15
many 1 95 15
in 1 95 15
Congress, 1 95 15
having 1 95 15
so 1 95 15
many 1 95 15
attractive 1 95 15
young 1 95 15
women 1 95 15
around 1 95 15
is 1 95 15
one 1 95 15
of 1 95 15
the 1 95 15
key 1 95 15
benefits 1 95 15
of 1 95 15
the 1 95 15
job. 1 95 15

I 0 95 16
included 0 95 16
the 0 95 16
following 0 95 16
quote 0 95 16
from 0 95 16
CNN 0 95 16
in 0 95 16
an 0 95 16
article 0 95 16
the 0 95 16
other 0 95 16
day, 0 95 16
but 0 95 16
I 0 95 16
also 0 95 16
believe 0 95 16
that 0 95 16
it 0 95 16
fits 0 95 16
just 0 95 16
perfectly 0 95 16
here… 0 95 16

In 0 95 17
an 0 95 17
environment 0 95 17
with 0 95 17
“so 0 95 17
many 0 95 17
young 0 95 17
women,” 0 95 17
said 0 95 17
one 0 95 17
ex-House 0 95 17
aide, 0 95 17
the 1 95 17
men 1 95 17
“have 1 95 17
no 1 95 17
self-control.” 1 95 17
“Amongst 0 95 17
ourselves, 0 95 17
we 0 95 17
know,” 0 95 17
a 0 95 17
former 0 95 17
Senate 0 95 17
staffer 0 95 17
said 0 95 17
of 0 95 17
the 1 95 17
lawmakers 1 95 17
with 1 95 17
the 1 95 17
worst 1 95 17
reputations. 1 95 17

And 0 95 18
sometimes, 0 95 18
the 0 95 18
sexual 0 95 18
advances 0 95 18
from 0 95 18
members 0 95 18
of 0 95 18
Congress 0 95 18
or 0 95 18
senior 0 95 18
aides 0 95 18
are 0 95 18
reciprocated 0 95 18
in 0 95 18
the 0 95 18
hopes 0 95 18
of 0 95 18
advancing 0 95 18
one’s 0 95 18
career 0 95 18
— 0 95 18
what 0 95 18
one 0 95 18
political 0 95 18
veteran 0 95 18
bluntly 0 95 18
referred 0 95 18
to 0 95 18
as 0 95 18
a 0 95 18
“sex 1 95 18
trade 1 95 18
on 1 95 18
Capitol 1 95 18
Hill.” 1 95 18

Do 0 95 19
you 0 95 19
want 0 95 19
to 0 95 19
stop 0 95 19
this 0 95 19
from 0 95 19
happening? 0 95 19

It 1 95 20
isn’t 1 95 20
going 1 95 20
to 1 95 20
stop 1 95 20
until 1 95 20
we 1 95 20
boot 1 95 20
out 1 95 20
the 1 95 20
corrupt 1 95 20
career 1 95 20
politicians 1 95 20
that 1 95 20
are 1 95 20
engaging 1 95 20
in 1 95 20
this 1 95 20
type 1 95 20
of 1 95 20
behavior. 1 95 20

So 0 95 21
I 0 95 21
am 0 95 21
asking 0 95 21
you 0 95 21
to 0 95 21
support 0 95 21
my 0 95 21
campaign 0 95 21
and 0 95 21
other 0 95 21
“grassroots 1 95 21
deplorables” 1 95 21
that 0 95 21
are 0 95 21
running 0 95 21
for 0 95 21
office 0 95 21
all 0 95 21
over 0 95 21
the 0 95 21
nation. 0 95 21

Morality 0 95 22
really 0 95 22
matters 0 95 22
when 0 95 22
it 0 95 22
comes 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
serving 0 95 22
in 0 95 22
public 0 95 22
office, 0 95 22
and 0 95 22
we 0 95 22
are 0 95 22
not 0 95 22
going 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
send 0 95 22
people 0 95 22
that 0 95 22
engage 0 95 22
in 0 95 22
sexually 0 95 22
inappropriate 0 95 22
behavior 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
Washington 0 95 22
anymore. 0 95 22

And 0 95 23
I 0 95 23
am 0 95 23
calling 0 95 23
on 0 95 23
Congress 0 95 23
to 0 95 23
immediately 0 95 23
release 0 95 23
the 0 95 23
details 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
all 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
the 0 95 23
264 0 95 23
cases 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
sexual 0 95 23
harassment 0 95 23
that 0 95 23
have 0 95 23
been 0 95 23
settled 0 95 23
since 0 95 23
1997. 0 95 23

The 1 95 24
American 1 95 24
people 1 95 24
have 1 95 24
a 1 95 24
right 1 95 24
to 1 95 24
know, 1 95 24
and 0 95 24
those 0 95 24
that 0 95 24
engaged 0 95 24
in 0 95 24
this 0 95 24
type 0 95 24
of 0 95 24
behavior 0 95 24
do 0 95 24
not 0 95 24
have 0 95 24
a 0 95 24
right 0 95 24

It 0 95 25
is 0 95 25
time 0 95 25
to 0 95 25
drain 0 95 25
the 0 95 25
swamp, 0 95 25
and 0 95 25
this 0 95 25
would 0 95 25
be 0 95 25
a 0 95 25
really 0 95 25

issue 0 101 2
is 0 101 2
a 0 101 2
large 0 101 2

This 0 101 5
is 0 101 5

most 0 101 5
actual 0 101 5

are 1 101 7
a 1 101 7

came 1 101 12
to 1 101 12
an 1 101 12
inglorious 1 101 12
end. 1 101 12

And 0 101 13
end 0 101 13
it 0 101 13
was 0 101 13
for 0 101 13
this 0 101 13

She 0 101 15

was 0 101 15
decider-in-chief 1 101 15

who 1 101 15

And 0 101 16
all 0 101 16
on 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
flimsy 0 101 16
excuse 0 101 16
that 0 101 16

clear 0 101 16
fact 0 101 16
that 0 101 16
the 0 101 16

had 0 101 16
long 0 101 16

religious 0 101 16

against 0 101 16

While 0 101 17
there 0 101 17
are 0 101 17
a 0 101 17
couple 0 101 17
of 0 101 17

that 0 101 17

Muslims, 0 101 17
most 0 101 17
non-Muslims 0 101 17
are 0 101 17
exempt. 0 101 17

As 0 101 18
moderates 0 101 18
go, 0 101 18
Indonesia 0 101 18
is 0 101 18
about 0 101 18
as 0 101 18
close 0 101 18
as 0 101 18
it 0 101 18
gets 0 101 18
to 0 101 18
moderate 0 101 18

Mostly 0 101 19
because 0 101 19
the 1 101 19

an 1 101 21

these 0 101 33

That, 0 101 34
of 0 101 34

not 0 101 34
her 0 101 34

the 0 101 35

that 0 101 35
Congress 0 101 35
gave 0 101 35
those 0 101 35
illegal 1 101 35
aliens. 1 101 35

And 0 101 36
they 0 101 36
did, 0 101 36
they 0 101 36
filed 0 101 36
for 0 101 36

why 0 112 7

Orban 0 112 7

Instead, 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
tough-talking 0 112 7
politician 0 112 7
said 0 112 7
they 0 112 7
were 0 112 7
regarded 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
“Muslim 1 112 7

all 0 112 7
of 0 112 7

not 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
rich 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
Germany 0 112 7
but 0 112 7
are 0 112 7
economically 0 112 7
stable, 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
PM 0 112 7
said. 0 112 7

He 0 112 8
was 0 112 8
apparently 0 112 8
referring 0 112 8
to 0 112 8
Turkey, 0 112 8
Greece, 0 112 8
Macedonia 0 112 8
and 0 112 8
Serbia 0 112 8
– 0 112 8
a 0 112 8
common 0 112 8
route 0 112 8
for 0 112 8

heading 0 112 8
for 0 112 8
‘wealthy’ 0 112 8

“So, 0 112 9
they 0 112 9

[in 0 112 9
these 0 112 9

They 0 112 10
are 0 112 10
merely 0 112 10
economic 0 112 10
migrants 0 112 10
seeking 0 112 10
a 0 112 10
better 0 112 10
life,” 0 112 10
Orban 0 112 10
concluded. 0 112 10

He 0 112 11
stressed 0 112 11
though, 0 112 11
that 0 112 11
he 0 112 11
can 0 112 11
only 0 112 11
speak 0 112 11
for 0 112 11
the 0 112 11
Hungarians 0 112 11
and 0 112 11
they 1 112 11
“don’t 1 112 11
want” 1 112 11
immigration. 1 112 11

In 0 112 12
his 0 112 12
view, 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
government 0 112 12
simply 0 112 12
can’t 0 112 12
go 0 112 12
against 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
will 0 112 12
of 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
people. 0 112 12

And 0 112 13
Orban 0 112 13
has 0 112 13
stayed 0 112 13
the 0 112 13
course, 0 112 13
too 0 112 13
while 0 112 13
governments 0 112 13
like 0 112 13
that 0 112 13
of 0 112 13
Germany 0 112 13
have 0 112 13
ignored 0 112 13
their 0 112 13

to 0 112 13

for 0 112 13
a 0 112 13
clear 0 112 13
invasion 0 112 13
of 0 112 13
Germany 0 112 13
that 0 112 13
has 0 112 13
led 0 112 13
to 0 112 13
untold 1 112 13
numbers 1 112 13
of 0 112 13
sexual 1 112 13

on 1 112 13

there's 1 112 13
no 1 112 13

of 1 112 13

further, 0 112 15
the 0 112 15
prime 0 112 15

noted 0 112 15
that 0 112 15

to 0 112 15
Portugal, 0 112 15
for 0 112 15

adding 0 112 15
that 0 112 15
the 0 112 15
majority 0 112 15
of 0 112 15
asylum 0 112 15
seekers 0 112 15
simply 0 112 15
wanted 0 112 15

live 0 112 15
in 0 112 15
prosperous 0 112 15
Germany. 0 112 15

“The 1 112 16
reason 1 112 16

in 1 112 16
your 1 112 16
country 1 112 16
is 1 112 16
not 1 112 16
because 1 112 16
they 1 112 16
are 1 112 16
refugees, 1 112 16
but 1 112 16
because 1 112 16
they 1 112 16
want 1 112 16
a 1 112 16
German 1 112 16
life,” 1 112 16
he 0 112 16
said, 0 112 16
describing 0 112 16
the 0 112 16
issue 0 112 16
“politically” 0 112 16
as 0 112 16
a 0 112 16
European 0 112 16
problem 0 112 16
but, 0 112 16
“sociologically,” 0 112 16
as 0 112 16
a 0 112 16
German 0 112 16
problem. 0 112 16

Orban 0 112 17
specifically 0 112 17
targeted 0 112 17
Germany 0 112 17
and 0 112 17
Chancellor 0 112 17
Angela 0 112 17
Merkel’s 0 112 17
‘open-door’ 0 112 17
policy 0 112 17
towards 0 112 17
asylum 0 112 17
seekers. 0 112 17

“I’ve 0 112 18
never 0 112 18
understood 0 112 18
how 0 112 18
chaos, 1 112 18
anarchy 1 112 18
and 1 112 18
illegal 1 112 18
border 1 112 18
crossings 1 112 18
are 0 112 18
viewed 0 112 18
as 0 112 18
something 0 112 18
good 0 112 18
in 0 112 18
a 0 112 18
country 0 112 18
like 0 112 18
Germany, 0 112 18
which 0 112 18
we 0 112 18
view 0 112 18
as 0 112 18
the 1 112 18
best 1 112 18
example 1 112 18
of 1 112 18
discipline 1 112 18
and 1 112 18
the 1 112 18
rule 1 112 18
of 1 112 18
law,” 1 112 18
he 0 112 18
said. 0 112 18

The 0 112 19
recent 0 112 19
wave 0 112 19
of 0 112 19
refugees 0 112 19
reaching 0 112 19
Europe 0 112 19
is 0 112 19
merely 0 112 19
an 0 112 19
invasion, 1 112 19
according 0 112 19
to 0 112 19
Orban. 0 112 19

“If 0 112 20
someone 0 112 20
wants 0 112 20
to 0 112 20
come 0 112 20
to 0 112 20
your 0 112 20
house, 0 112 20
he 0 112 20
knocks 0 112 20
on 0 112 20
your 0 112 20
door 0 112 20
and 0 112 20
asks: 0 112 20
‘Can 0 112 20

in, 0 112 20
can 0 112 20

They 0 112 20
[asylum 0 112 20

didn’t 0 112 20
do 0 112 20
that, 0 112 20
they 0 112 20
crossed 0 112 20
the 0 112 20
border 0 112 20
illegally,” 0 112 20
he 0 112 20
stated. 0 112 20

Orban 0 112 21
then 0 112 21
did 0 112 21
what 0 112 21
most 0 112 21
political 0 112 21
representatives 0 112 21
will 0 112 21
simply 0 112 21
not 0 112 21
do, 0 112 21
he 0 112 21
told 0 112 21
the 0 112 21
truth 0 112 21
about 0 112 21
multiculturalism. 0 112 21

He 0 112 22
called 0 112 22
it 0 112 22
an 0 112 22
"illusion" 0 112 22
and 0 112 22
said 0 112 22
that 0 112 22
Christian 1 112 22

Muslim 1 112 22
societies 1 112 22
“will 1 112 22

Of 0 112 23
course, 0 112 23
they 0 112 23
won't. 0 112 23

PM 0 112 29
Orban 0 112 29

He 0 112 30

He 0 112 31

which 0 112 31
is 0 112 31

he 1 112 33
seems 1 112 33
to 1 112 33
be 1 112 33
one 1 112 33
that 1 112 33
holds 1 112 33
to 1 112 33
the 1 112 33
Christian 1 112 33
faith, 1 112 33
as 1 112 33
emulated 1 112 33
by 1 112 33
the 1 112 33
Protestant 1 112 33
Reformers, 1 112 33
saying, 1 112 33
"That 1 112 33

to 0 114 12

a 0 114 12
simple 0 114 12
question: 0 114 12

did 0 114 12
they 0 114 12
literally 0 114 12
risk 0 114 12

“a 0 114 12

as 0 114 12
the 0 114 12
pope 0 114 12
“seems 0 114 12
to 0 114 12
teach”? 0 114 12

It’s 0 114 13
a 0 114 13
question 0 114 13
he 0 114 13
refuses 0 114 13
to 0 114 13
answer, 0 114 13
despite 0 114 13
endless 0 114 13
platitudes 0 114 13
of 0 114 13
how 0 114 13
important 0 114 13
it 0 114 13
is 0 114 13
to 0 114 13
be 0 114 13
close 0 114 13

are 0 114 14
not 0 114 14
dissuaded 0 114 14

their 0 114 14
pursuit 0 114 14
of 0 114 14
a 0 114 14
paternal 0 114 14
answer: 0 114 14

You 0 114 15
do 0 114 15
not 0 114 15
like 0 114 15
to 0 114 15

neither 0 114 15
do 0 114 15
we, 0 114 15

allow 0 114 15
us 0 114 15
to 0 114 15

253 0 114 15
of 0 114 15
Evangelii 0 114 15
Gaudium, 0 114 15
because 0 114 15
it 1 114 15
does 1 114 15
not 1 114 15
account 1 114 15
for 1 114 15
the 1 114 15
fact 1 114 15
that 1 114 15
Islam 1 114 15
came 1 114 15
AFTER 1 114 15
Christ, 1 114 15
and 1 114 15
so 1 114 15
is, 1 114 15
and 1 114 15
can 1 114 15
only 1 114 15
be, 1 114 15

and 0 114 15
one 0 114 15
of 0 114 15
the 0 114 15
most 0 114 15
dangerous 0 114 15
because 0 114 15
it 0 114 15
presents 0 114 15
itself 0 114 15
as 0 114 15
the 0 114 15

The 0 114 24
letter 0 114 24
makes 0 114 24
short 0 114 24
work 0 114 24
of 0 114 24
the 0 114 24
notion 0 114 24
that 0 114 24
Islam 0 114 24
and 0 114 24
Christianity 0 114 24
can 0 114 24
ever 0 114 24
be 0 114 24
compatible, 0 114 24
or 0 114 24
that 0 114 24
Islam 0 114 24
can 0 114 24
serve 0 114 24
as 0 114 24
a 0 114 24
path 0 114 24
to 0 114 24
salvation: 0 114 24

In 0 114 25
fact, 0 114 25
as 0 114 25
long 0 114 25
as 0 114 25
Islam 0 114 25
wants 0 114 25
us 0 114 25
to 0 114 25
be 0 114 25
its 0 114 25
enemy, 0 114 25
we 0 114 25
are, 0 114 25

all 0 114 25
our 0 114 25
protestations 0 114 25
of 0 114 25
friendship 0 114 25
cannot 0 114 25

anything. 0 114 25

As 1 114 26
a 1 114 26
proper 1 114 26
Antichrist, 1 114 26
Islam 1 114 26
exists 1 114 26
only 1 114 26
as 1 114 26
an 1 114 26
enemy 1 114 26
of 1 114 26

“Between 0 114 26

(Qur’an 0 114 26

For 1 114 26
the 1 114 26

them 1 114 26
(Quran 0 114 26

We 0 114 27
must 0 114 27
not 0 114 27
be 0 114 27
deceived 0 114 27
by 0 114 27
the 0 114 27
Quranic 0 114 27
verses 0 114 27
deemed 0 114 27

because 0 114 27
they 0 114 27

Where 0 114 28

proclaims 0 114 28
the 0 114 28
good 0 114 28

of 0 114 28
Jesus’ 0 114 28

Allah 1 114 28
has 1 114 28
nothing 1 114 28

(Quran 0 114 28

not 0 114 28
confuse 0 114 28
Islam 0 114 28
with 0 114 28

if 0 114 28
for 0 114 28
you 0 114 28
“dialogue” 0 114 28
means 0 114 28
the 0 114 28
voice 0 114 28
of 0 114 28
peace, 0 114 28
for 0 114 28

only 0 114 28
another 0 114 28
way 0 114 28
to 0 114 28

Also, 0 114 29
as 0 114 29
it 0 114 29

the 0 114 29

in 0 114 29
the 0 114 29
face 0 114 29
of 0 114 29

is 0 114 29
suicidal 0 114 29

very 0 114 29
dangerous. 0 114 29

How 0 114 30
can 0 114 30
you 0 114 30
speak 0 114 30
of 0 114 30

“(Rome, 0 114 31

that 1 114 34

can 1 114 34

(Lk 0 114 34

They 0 114 34
contest 0 114 34
the 0 114 34
idea 0 114 34
that 0 114 34
speaking 0 114 34

an 0 114 34
“Islamophilic 0 114 34

not 0 114 34
doubt 0 114 34

The 1 114 35

and 1 114 51
any 1 114 51
complacency 1 114 51

refuge? 0 114 53

The 0 114 53

that 0 114 53

We 0 115 0

be 0 115 1
more 0 115 1
like 0 115 1
Sweden. 0 115 1

That 0 115 2
means 0 115 2
turning 0 115 2
our 0 115 2
country 0 115 2
into 0 115 2
a 1 115 2

where 1 115 2
the 1 115 2

overtaxed 1 115 2

should 0 115 4

would 0 115 16
anyone 0 115 16
associate 0 115 16
rising 0 115 16

Maybe 0 115 17
because 0 115 17
the 0 115 17

Hadeed: 0 71 56
Why 1 71 56
do 1 71 56
your 1 71 56
signatures 1 71 56
look 1 71 56
different? 1 71 56

Abid: 0 71 57
My 0 71 57
signatures 0 71 57
are 0 71 57
not 0 71 57
very 0 71 57

I’m 1 71 57
just 1 71 57
a 1 71 57
human 1 71 57

Hadeed: 0 71 58
You 0 71 58
were 0 71 58

Abid: 0 71 59
That 0 71 59
was 0 71 59
my 0 71 59
father’s 0 71 59
request… 0 71 59

Hadeed: 0 71 60
You’re 0 71 60
not 0 71 60
answering 0 71 60
the 0 71 60
question. 0 71 60

Abid: 0 71 61
I’m 0 71 61
not 0 71 61
very 0 71 61
smart, 0 71 61
so 0 71 61
it 0 71 61
takes 0 71 61
a 0 71 61

so 0 71 65
in 0 71 65

her. 0 71 65

Based 0 71 66

the 0 71 66

that, 0 71 66
“The 0 71 66

Gilani 0 71 67
retained 0 71 67
a 0 71 67

Bacon 0 71 67
had 0 71 67
offered 0 71 67
a 0 71 67

they’d 0 71 67

Gilani 0 71 67
declined 0 71 67

“You’re 0 71 71

after 0 71 72

that 0 71 72
her 0 71 72

“I 0 71 73

He 0 237 15

he 0 237 15
only 0 237 15
wanted 0 237 15
service 0 237 15

federal 0 237 15

Saucier 0 237 16

that 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
recognized 0 237 16
he 0 237 16

where 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
worked. 0 237 16

But 0 237 17
he 0 237 17
lashed 0 237 17
out 0 237 17
at 0 237 17
Obama 0 237 17
officials, 0 237 17
saying 0 237 17
that 0 237 17
his 0 237 17
prosecution 0 237 17
was 0 237 17
politically 0 237 17
motivated, 0 237 17
prompted 0 237 17
by 0 237 17
sensitivity 0 237 17
about 0 237 17
classified 0 237 17
information 0 237 17
amid 0 237 17

emails. 0 237 17

“My 0 237 18
case 0 237 18
was 0 237 18

by 0 237 18
military 0 237 18
courts,” 0 237 18
he 0 237 18

“They 1 237 19
used 1 237 19
me 1 237 19
as 1 237 19
an 1 237 19

Saucier, 0 237 20
31, 0 237 20
said 0 237 20
that 0 237 20
the 0 237 20
pardon 0 237 20
has 0 237 20
enabled 0 237 20
him 0 237 20
to 0 237 20
pick 0 237 20
up 0 237 20
the 0 237 20
pieces 0 237 20
and 0 237 20
rebuild 0 237 20

his 0 237 20
wife 0 237 20

young 0 237 20
daughter. 0 237 20

A 0 237 21
felony 0 237 21
conviction 0 237 21
left 0 237 21
him 0 237 21
scrambling 0 237 21
to 0 237 21
find 0 237 21
work; 0 237 21
he 0 237 21
finally 0 237 21
landed 0 237 21
a 0 237 21
job 0 237 21
collecting 0 237 21
garbage. 0 237 21

Now, 0 237 22
he 0 237 22
works 0 237 22
on 0 237 22
design 0 237 22
and 0 237 22
engineering 0 237 22
projects 0 237 22
for 0 237 22
an 0 237 22

company. 0 237 22

“Things 0 237 23
are 0 237 23
starting 0 237 23
to 0 237 23
go 0 237 23
in 0 237 23
the 0 237 23
right 0 237 23
direction,” 0 237 23
Saucier 0 237 23
said. 0 237 23

“I 0 237 24
work 0 237 24
with 0 237 24
a 0 237 24
group 0 237 24
of 0 237 24
really 0 237 24
great 0 237 24
people, 0 237 24
I 0 237 24
get 0 237 24
to 0 237 24
use 0 237 24
my 0 237 24
skills 0 237 24
set.” 0 237 24

Because 0 237 25
of 0 237 25
the 0 237 25
loss 0 237 25
of 0 237 25
income 0 237 25
during 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
imprisonment, 0 237 25
as 0 237 25
well 0 237 25
as 0 237 25
earning 0 237 25
below 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
potential 0 237 25
when 0 237 25
he 0 237 25
collected 0 237 25
garbage, 0 237 25
he 0 237 25
and 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
wife 0 237 25
Sadie 0 237 25
lost 0 237 25
their 0 237 25
home 0 237 25
to 0 237 25
foreclosure. 0 237 25

Debt 0 237 26
collectors 0 237 26
called 0 237 26
and 0 237 26
his 0 237 26
cars 0 237 26
were 0 237 26
repossessed. 0 237 26

“With 0 237 27
a 0 237 27
pardon 0 237 27
there’s 0 237 27
no 0 237 27
magic 0 237 27
wand 0 237 27
that 0 237 27
that 0 237 27
gets 0 237 27
waved 0 237 27

makes 0 237 27
everything 0 237 27
right,” 0 237 27

“But 0 237 27
I 0 237 27

stay 0 237 27
positive 0 237 27
and 0 237 27
look 0 237 27
forward.” 0 237 27

He 0 237 28
praises 0 237 28
the 0 237 28
pardons 0 237 28
that 0 237 28
Trump 0 237 28
has 0 237 28
granted, 0 237 28
and 0 237 28
takes 0 237 28
exception 0 237 28
at 0 237 28
the 0 237 28
criticism. 0 237 28

“The 0 237 29
Obama 0 237 29
administration 0 237 29
singled 0 237 29
out 0 237 29

“President 0 237 30

the 0 238 4

work, 0 238 4
I 0 238 4
think 0 238 4
partly 0 238 4
because 0 238 4
they’re 0 238 4
frustrated 0 238 4

Clinton 0 238 4

published 0 238 7
earlier 0 238 7
this 0 238 7

was 0 238 7
questioning 0 238 7
the 0 238 7
narrative 0 238 7
surrounding 0 238 7
the 0 238 7
affair, 0 238 7
which 0 238 7
played 0 238 7
a 0 238 7
central 0 238 7
role 0 238 7
in 0 238 7
Clinton’s 0 238 7

“Now, 0 238 8
at 0 238 8

I’m 0 238 8
beginning 0 238 8
(just 0 238 8
beginning) 0 238 8
to 0 238 8
consider 0 238 8
the 0 238 8
implications 0 238 8
of 0 238 8
power 0 238 8

that 0 238 8
were 0 238 8
so 0 238 8
vast 0 238 8
between 0 238 8
a 0 238 8

a 0 238 8

that 0 238 9
in 0 238 9
such 0 238 9
a 0 238 9
circumstance 0 238 9
the 0 238 9

might 0 238 9
well 0 238 9
be 0 238 9
rendered 0 238 9

When 0 238 10
asked 0 238 10
if 0 238 10
he 0 238 10
owed 0 238 10
Lewinsky 0 238 10
an 0 238 10
apology, 0 238 10
President 0 238 10
Clinton 0 238 10
told 0 238 10

“No, 0 238 10

I 0 238 10
have 0 238 10
never 0 238 10
talked 0 238 10
to 0 238 10

But 0 238 11
I 0 238 11
did 0 238 11
say 0 238 11
publicly 0 238 11

That’s 0 238 12
very 0 238 12

the 0 247 5

started 0 247 8
after 0 247 8

By 0 247 58
removing 0 247 58
foreign 0 247 58
competitors, 0 247 58
Trump 0 247 58
may 0 247 58
have 0 247 58
done 0 247 58
more 0 247 58
for 0 247 58
blacks 0 247 58
in 0 247 58
11 0 247 58

Obama 0 247 58
did 0 247 58
in 0 247 58
eight 0 247 58
years. 0 247 58

Of 0 247 59
course, 0 247 59
this 0 247 59
could 0 247 59
be 0 247 59
affected 0 247 59
by 0 247 59
statistical 0 247 59
noise—and 0 247 59
it 0 247 59
could 0 247 59
be 0 247 59
undone 0 247 59
by 0 247 59
e.g. 0 247 59

a 0 247 60
DACA 0 247 60
capitulation. 0 247 60

But 0 247 61
right 0 247 61
now 0 247 61
it 0 247 61
increasingly 0 247 61
appears 0 247 61
the 0 247 61
Trump 0 247 61
Effect 0 247 61
is 0 247 61
real—and 0 247 61
achieved 0 247 61
entirely 0 247 61
through 0 247 61
enhanced 0 247 61
enforcement. 0 247 61

What 0 247 62
could 0 247 62
happen 0 247 62
if 0 247 62
the 0 247 62
GOP-controlled 0 247 62

While 0 249 16
May 0 249 16

a 1 249 16
welcome 1 249 16

Trump 0 249 16
supporters 0 249 16
have 0 249 16
reason 0 249 16
to 0 249 16
complain: 0 249 16
Since 0 249 16
taking 0 249 16
office 0 249 16
in 0 249 16
January 0 249 16
2017 0 249 16
President 0 249 16
Trump 0 249 16
has 0 249 16
presided 0 249 16
over 0 249 16
a 0 249 16
labor 0 249 16
market 0 249 16
in 0 249 16
which 0 249 16
immigrants 0 249 16
have 0 249 16
gained 0 249 16
1.006 0 249 16
million 0 249 16
jobs, 0 249 16
a 0 249 16
3.9% 0 249 16
increase, 0 249 16
while 0 249 16
native-born 0 249 16
Americans 0 249 16
gained 0 249 16
about 0 249 16
2.4 0 249 16
million 0 249 16
jobs 0 249 16
—a 0 249 16
rise 0 249 16
of 0 249 16
only 0 249 16
1.9%. 0 249 16

As 0 249 17
far 0 249 17
as 0 249 17
the 0 249 17
labor 0 249 17
market 0 249 17
is 0 249 17
concerned, 0 249 17
“America 1 249 17
First” 1 249 17
has 0 249 17
not 0 249 17
translated 0 249 17
to 0 249 17
Americans 0 249 17
First. 0 249 17

In 0 249 18
normal 0 249 18
times, 0 249 18
this 0 249 18
might 0 249 18
be 0 249 18
a 0 249 18
big 0 249 18
story. 0 249 18

But 0 249 19
the 0 249 19
even 0 249 19
the 1 249 19
conservative 1 249 19
non-Main 1 249 19
Stream 1 249 19

is 0 249 19
currently 0 249 19
too 1 249 19
steeped 1 249 19
in 1 249 19
economic 1 249 19
euphoria 1 249 19
to 0 249 19
notice. 0 249 19

Nd 0 249 20
anyway, 0 249 20
they 0 249 20
almost 0 249 20
never 0 249 20
report 0 249 20
the 0 249 20
immigration 0 249 20
dimension. 0 249 20

However, 0 249 21
it 0 249 21
is 0 249 21
now 0 249 21
absolutely 0 249 21
clear 0 249 21
that 0 249 21
immigration, 0 249 21
and 0 249 21
immigrant 0 249 21
displacement 0 249 21

workers, 0 249 21
cannot 0 249 21
be 0 249 21
jawboned 1 249 21
away. 1 249 21

The 1 249 22
only 1 249 22
answer 1 249 22
is 1 249 22
legislation— 1 249 22
border 1 249 22
wall 1 249 22
to 1 249 22
stop 1 249 22

including 1 249 22

a 1 249 22

legal 1 249 22
immigration. 1 249 22

the 0 275 16
border, 0 275 16
we 0 275 16
should 0 275 16
not 0 275 16
even 0 275 16
bring 0 275 16
them 0 275 16
into 0 275 16
the 0 275 16
system 0 275 16
if 0 275 16
they 0 275 16
are 0 275 16
not 0 275 16
citizens, 0 275 16
but 0 275 16
walk 0 275 16
them 0 275 16
back 0 275 16
over 0 275 16
the 0 275 16

and 0 275 16
make 0 275 16
sure 0 275 16
they 0 275 16
keep 0 275 16

Often, 0 275 17
by 0 275 17
putting 0 275 17
illegals 0 275 17
into 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
system, 0 275 17
it 0 275 17
takes 0 275 17
years 0 275 17
to 0 275 17
deport 0 275 17
them, 0 275 17
which 0 275 17
costs 0 275 17

American 1 275 17
people 1 275 17
lots 0 275 17
of 0 275 17
money. 0 275 17

That 0 275 18
system 0 275 18
would 0 275 18
require 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
judges 0 275 18

handle 0 275 18
more 0 275 18

and 0 275 18
Trump 0 275 18
ripped 0 275 18
the 0 275 18
calls 0 275 18
for 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
judges 0 275 18
in 0 275 18
favor 0 275 18
of 0 275 18
a 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
"simple 0 275 18

plan." 0 275 18

“We 0 275 19
want 0 275 19
strong 0 275 19
borders 0 275 19
and 0 275 19
we 0 275 19
want 0 275 19
no 0 275 19
crime,” 0 275 19
Trump 0 275 19
said. 0 275 19

“The 1 275 20
Democrats 1 275 20
want 1 275 20
open 1 275 20

they 1 275 20
don’t 1 275 20
care 1 275 20
about 1 275 20
crime.” 1 275 20

Trump 0 275 21
then 0 275 21
called 0 275 21
on 0 275 21
Congress 0 275 21
to 0 275 21
correct 0 275 21
the 0 275 21
problems 0 275 21
created 0 275 21
by 0 275 21
legislation 0 275 21
with 0 275 21
more 0 275 21
legislation. 0 275 21

“The 0 275 22
laws 0 275 22
are 0 275 22
obsolete, 0 275 22
the 0 275 22
laws 0 275 22
are 0 275 22
horrible, 1 275 22
having 0 275 22
to 0 275 22
do 0 275 22
with 0 275 22
the 0 275 22
border, 0 275 22
both 0 275 22
in 0 275 22
terms 0 275 22
of 0 275 22
security 0 275 22
and 0 275 22
in 0 275 22

of 0 275 22
taking 0 275 22
care 0 275 22
of 0 275 22
people,” 0 275 22
he 0 275 22
said. 0 275 22

“We 1 275 23
want 1 275 23
children 1 275 23
staying 1 275 23
together,” 1 275 23
Trump 0 275 23
said, 0 275 23
blasting 0 275 23
the 0 275 23
New 0 275 23
York 0 275 23
Times 0 275 23
report 0 275 23
that 0 275 23
said 0 275 23
he 0 275 23
didn't 0 275 23
really 0 275 23
want 0 275 23
to 0 275 23
sign 0 275 23
his 0 275 23
executive 0 275 23
order 0 275 23
last 0 275 23
week 0 275 23
that 0 275 23
would 0 275 23
keep 0 275 23
families 0 275 23
together 0 275 23
in 0 275 23
detention 0 275 23
while 0 275 23
they 0 275 23
awaited 0 275 23
the 0 275 23
judicial 0 275 23
process. 0 275 23

Of 0 275 24
course, 0 275 24
Trump 0 275 24
has 0 275 24
inherited 0 275 24
a 0 275 24
problem 0 275 24
that 0 275 24
has 0 275 24
existed 0 275 24
for 0 275 24
several 0 275 24
administrations, 0 275 24
both 0 275 24
Republican 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
Democrat, 0 275 24
for 0 275 24
decades. 0 275 24

It 0 275 25
is 0 275 25
time 0 275 25
that 0 275 25
Congress 0 275 25
sure 0 275 25
up 0 275 25
things 0 275 25
so 0 275 25
that 0 275 25
America's 1 275 25
tax 1 275 25
dollars 1 275 25
are 0 275 25
not 0 275 25
bound 0 275 25
up 0 275 25
in 0 275 25
a 0 275 25
worthless 1 275 25
judicial 0 275 25
process 0 275 25
when 0 275 25
people 0 275 25
are 0 275 25
clearly 0 275 25
in 0 275 25
the 0 275 25

illegally. 0 275 25

Sadly, 0 275 26
too 0 275 26
many 0 275 26
people 0 275 26
want 0 275 26
more 0 275 26

which 0 275 26
begs 0 275 26

anti-Semitic 1 283 2
shot 1 283 2
at 1 283 2
Israeli 1 283 2

to 0 283 2
denounce 0 283 2

And 0 283 3
he 1 283 3

that 1 283 3
“all 0 283 3

The 0 283 4
Middle 0 283 4

He 0 283 4
cried: 0 283 4
“Indifference 1 283 4

silent 1 283 5
as 1 283 5

who 0 299 8
lodged 0 299 8
a 0 299 8
complaint. 0 299 8

The 0 299 9
anti-Semitic 0 299 9
attacker 0 299 9
was 0 299 9
arrested 0 299 9
and 0 299 9
placed 0 299 9
in 0 299 9
police 0 299 9

and 0 299 9
then 0 299 9
transferred 0 299 9
to 0 299 9
the 0 299 9
psychiatric 0 299 9
infirmary, 0 299 9
on 0 299 9
the 0 299 9
recommendation 0 299 9
of 0 299 9
the 0 299 9
doctor 0 299 9
because 0 299 9
of 0 299 9
his 0 299 9
observed 0 299 9
state 0 299 9
of 0 299 9
excitement. 0 299 9

It's 0 299 10
okay. 0 299 10

Getting 0 299 11
really 1 299 11
excited 1 299 11
about 0 299 11
Jews 0 299 11
is 0 299 11
a 0 299 11
common 0 299 11
problem 0 299 11
among 0 299 11
Muslim 0 299 11
settlers 0 299 11
in 0 299 11
France. 0 299 11

Earlier 0 299 12
this 0 299 12
month, 0 299 12
the 0 299 12
suspect 0 299 12
in 0 299 12
the 0 299 12
alleged 0 299 12
murder 0 299 12
of 0 299 12
a 0 299 12
Jewish 0 299 12
physician 0 299 12
in 0 299 12
Paris 0 299 12
was 0 299 12
deemed 0 299 12
not 0 299 12
responsible 0 299 12
for 0 299 12
his 0 299 12
actions 0 299 12
in 0 299 12
a 0 299 12
second 0 299 12
psychiatric 0 299 12
evaluation 0 299 12
ordered 0 299 12
by 0 299 12
a 0 299 12
judge 0 299 12
even 0 299 12
though 0 299 12
the 0 299 12
defense 0 299 12
did 0 299 12
not 0 299 12
request 0 299 12
it. 0 299 12

The 0 299 13
suspect, 0 299 13
Traore 0 299 13
Kobili, 0 299 13
is 0 299 13
scheduled 0 299 13
to 0 299 13
have 0 299 13
a 0 299 13
third 0 299 13
evaluation 0 299 13
to 0 299 13
determine 0 299 13
his 0 299 13
ability 0 299 13
to 0 299 13
stand 0 299 13
trial 0 299 13
for 0 299 13
the 0 299 13
murder 0 299 13
of 0 299 13
Sarah 0 299 13
Halimi 0 299 13
in 0 299 13
April 0 299 13
2017. 0 299 13

He 0 299 14
is 0 299 14
alleged 0 299 14
to 0 299 14
have 0 299 14
beaten 1 299 14
her 1 299 14
to 1 299 14
death 1 299 14
while 0 299 14
calling 0 299 14
her 0 299 14
a 0 299 14
demon 1 299 14
and 0 299 14
shouting 0 299 14
about 0 299 14
Allah 0 299 14
before 0 299 14
throwing 0 299 14
her 0 299 14
body 0 299 14
from 0 299 14
the 0 299 14
window 0 299 14
of 0 299 14
her 0 299 14
third-story 0 299 14
apartment. 0 299 14

They're 1 299 15
all 1 299 15
crazy 1 299 15
in 1 299 15
Europe. 1 299 15

A 0 299 16
Muslim 0 299 16
terrorist 0 299 16
stabbed 0 299 16
four 0 299 16
people 0 299 16
at 0 299 16
a 0 299 16
train 0 299 16
station 0 299 16
near 0 299 16
Munich 0 299 16
while 0 299 16
screaming, 0 299 16
“Allahu 1 299 16
Akbar”. 1 299 16

In 0 299 17
between 0 299 17
proclaiming 0 299 17
the 0 299 17
glory 0 299 17
of 0 299 17
Allah, 0 299 17
he 0 299 17
also 0 299 17
shouted 0 299 17
that 0 299 17
his 0 299 17
victims 0 299 17
were 0 299 17
all 0 299 17
“unbelievers”. 1 299 17

A 0 299 18
woman 0 299 18
heard 0 299 18
him 0 299 18
say, 0 299 18
“Infidel, 1 299 18
you 1 299 18
must 1 299 18
die”. 1 299 18

The 0 299 19
German 0 299 19
authorities 0 299 19
came 0 299 19
to 0 299 19
the 0 299 19
inescapable 0 299 19
conclusion 0 299 19
that 0 299 19
the 0 299 19
attack 0 299 19
had 0 299 19
nothing 0 299 19
to 0 299 19
do 0 299 19
with 0 299 19
Islam. 0 299 19

Instead 0 299 20
the 0 299 20
Muslim 0 299 20
terrorist 0 299 20
had 0 299 20
been 0 299 20
“mentally 1 299 20
ill” 1 299 20
and 0 299 20
was 0 299 20
probably 0 299 20
not 0 299 20
even 0 299 20
fit 0 299 20
to 0 299 20
stand 0 299 20
trial. 0 299 20

And 0 299 21
in 0 299 21
Russia. 0 299 21

Gyulchekhra 0 299 22
Bobokulova 0 299 22
beheaded 1 299 22
a 0 299 22
4-year-old 0 299 22
girl 0 299 22
and 0 299 22
displayed 0 299 22
her 0 299 22
head 0 299 22
in 0 299 22
the 0 299 22
street 0 299 22
while 0 299 22
shouting, 0 299 22
“Allahu 1 299 22
Akbar. 1 299 22

I 0 299 23
hate 0 299 23
democracy. 0 299 23

I 0 299 24
am 0 299 24
a 0 299 24
terrorist. 0 299 24

I 0 299 25
want 0 299 25
you 0 299 25
dead.” 0 299 25
Faced 0 299 25
with 0 299 25
these 0 299 25
bafflingly 0 299 25
inscrutable 0 299 25
statements, 0 299 25
the 0 299 25
authorities 0 299 25
blamed 0 299 25
mental 1 299 25
illness. 1 299 25

And 0 299 26
Amsterdam. 0 299 26

In 0 299 27
May, 0 299 27
Malek, 0 299 27
a 0 299 27
Syrian 0 299 27
refugee, 0 299 27
stabbed 0 299 27
three 0 299 27
people 0 299 27
in 0 299 27
The 0 299 27
Hague 0 299 27
while 0 299 27
shouting, 0 299 27
“Allahu 1 299 27
Akbar.” 1 299 27
The 0 299 27
Syrian 0 299 27
had 0 299 27
previously 0 299 27
thanked 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
Dutch 0 299 27
people 0 299 27
for 0 299 27
their 0 299 27
hospitality 0 299 27
by 0 299 27
shouting, 0 299 27
“Allahu 1 299 27
Akbar,” 1 299 27
and 0 299 27
throwing 0 299 27
pieces 0 299 27
of 0 299 27
furniture 0 299 27
out 0 299 27
of 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
window 0 299 27
of 0 299 27
his 0 299 27
apartment 0 299 27
and 0 299 27
into 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
street. 0 299 27

On 0 299 28
the 0 299 28
loose, 0 299 28
Malek 0 299 28
cut 0 299 28
a 0 299 28
man’s 0 299 28
throat. 0 299 28

He 0 299 29
also 0 299 29
stabbed 0 299 29
two 0 299 29
others. 0 299 29

Police 0 299 30
shot 0 299 30
him 0 299 30
in 0 299 30
the 0 299 30
leg, 0 299 30
ruled 0 299 30
out 0 299 30
terrorism 0 299 30
and 0 299 30
blamed 0 299 30
mental 1 299 30
illness. 1 299 30

In 0 299 31
December 0 299 31
of 0 299 31
last 0 299 31
year, 0 299 31
Saleh 0 299 31
Ali, 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
Syrian 0 299 31
refugee 0 299 31
wearing 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
keffiyah 0 299 31
and 0 299 31
waving 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
terrorist 0 299 31
PLO 0 299 31
flag, 0 299 31
went 0 299 31
up 0 299 31
to 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
Jewish 0 299 31
restaurant 0 299 31
in 0 299 31
Amsterdam, 0 299 31
shouted 0 299 31
“Allahu 1 299 31
Akbar” 1 299 31
and 0 299 31
began 0 299 31
smashing 0 299 31
the 0 299 31
windows. 0 299 31

The 0 299 32
police 0 299 32
stood 0 299 32
by 0 299 32
and 0 299 32
watched 0 299 32
until 0 299 32
he 0 299 32
was 0 299 32
done. 0 299 32

And 0 299 33
then 0 299 33
they 0 299 33
arrested 0 299 33
him. 0 299 33

Ali 0 299 34
admitted 0 299 34
to 0 299 34
having 0 299 34
fought 0 299 34
with 0 299 34
Jihadists 0 299 34
in 0 299 34
Syria. 0 299 34

So 0 299 35
the 0 299 35
system 0 299 35
decided 0 299 35
that 0 299 35
he 0 299 35
needed 0 299 35
a 0 299 35
psychiatric 0 299 35
evaluation 0 299 35

Maybe 0 299 36
it's 0 299 36
not 0 299 36
the 0 299 36
terrorists 0 299 36
who 0 299 36
are 0 299 36
nuts. 1 299 36

Maybe 1 299 36

it's 1 299 36

the 1 299 36

authorities 1 299 36

who 1 299 36

are 1 299 36

insane. 1 299 36

no 0 301 1
fan 0 301 1
of 0 301 1
President 0 301 1
Trump’s 0 301 1
policies, 0 301 1
but 0 301 1
he 0 301 1
simply 0 301 1
cannot 0 301 1
understand 0 301 1
how 0 301 1
the 0 301 1
leftwing 0 301 1

keeps 0 301 1
getting 0 301 1
so 0 301 1
riled 0 301 1
up 0 301 1
at 0 301 1
everything 0 301 1
that 0 301 1
Trump 0 301 1
does. 0 301 1

In 0 301 2
Greenwald’s 0 301 2
mind, 0 301 2
Trump 0 301 2
is 0 301 2
a 0 301 2
fairly 0 301 2
standard 1 301 2
politician 1 301 2
(when 0 301 2
it 0 301 2
comes 0 301 2
to 0 301 2
the 0 301 2
policies 0 301 2
he 0 301 2
supports 0 301 2
and 0 301 2
implements), 0 301 2
which 0 301 2
is 0 301 2
what 0 301 2
makes 0 301 2
the 0 301 2

constant 0 301 2
flow 0 301 2
of 0 301 2
outrage 0 301 2
so 0 301 2
mystifying. 0 301 2

In 0 301 3

with 0 301 4
Putin 0 301 4
was 0 301 4
ridiculous. 1 301 4

Why? 0 301 5

Because, 0 301 6
when 0 301 6
Trump’s 0 301 6
Russia 0 301 6

are 0 301 6

it 0 301 6
becomes 0 301 6
CLEAR 0 301 6
that 0 301 6

tougher 1 301 6

Here’s 0 301 18
the 0 301 18
crux 0 301 18
of 0 301 18
Greenwald’s 0 301 18

So 0 301 19
let 0 301 19
me 0 301 19
just 0 301 19
make 0 301 19
two 0 301 19
points. 0 301 19

Number 0 301 20
one 0 301 20
is, 0 301 20
if 0 301 20
you 0 301 20
look 0 301 20
at 0 301 20
President 0 301 20

Trump, 0 301 20
there’s 0 301 20
no 0 301 20
question 0 301 20
that 0 301 20
President 0 301 20
Obama 0 301 20
was 0 301 20
more 0 301 20
cooperative 0 301 20

President 0 301 21
Trump 0 301 21
has 0 301 21
sent 0 301 21
lethal 1 301 21
arms 0 301 21
to 0 301 21
Ukraine—a 0 301 21
crucial 0 301 21
issue 0 301 21
for 0 301 21
Putin—which 0 301 21
President 0 301 21
Obama 0 301 21
refused 0 301 21
to 0 301 21
do. 0 301 21

President 0 301 22
Trump 0 301 22
has 0 301 22
bombed 0 301 22
the 0 301 22
Assad 0 301 22
forces 0 301 22
in 0 301 22
Syria, 0 301 22
a 0 301 22
client 0 301 22
state 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
Putin, 0 301 22
something 0 301 22
that 0 301 22
Obama 0 301 22
refused 0 301 22
to 0 301 22
do 0 301 22
because 0 301 22
he 0 301 22
didn’t 0 301 22
want 0 301 22
to 0 301 22
provoke 0 301 22
Putin. 0 301 22

Trump 0 301 23
has 0 301 23
expelled 0 301 23
more 1 301 23
Russian 0 301 23
diplomats 0 301 23
and 0 301 23
sanctioned 0 301 23
more 1 301 23
Russian 0 301 23
oligarchs 0 301 23
than 0 301 23
[Obama] 0 301 23
has. 0 301 23

Trump 0 301 24
undid 0 301 24
the 0 301 24
Iran 0 301 24
deal, 0 301 24
which 0 301 24
Russia 0 301 24
favored, 0 301 24
while 0 301 24
Obama 0 301 24
worked 0 301 24

Russia 0 301 24
in 0 301 24

the 0 301 24
Iran 0 301 24
deal. 0 301 24

So 0 301 25
this 0 301 25
idea 0 301 25
that 0 301 25
Trump 0 301 25
is 0 301 25
some 0 301 25
kind 0 301 25
of 0 301 25
a 0 301 25
puppet 1 301 25
of 0 301 25
Putin, 0 301 25
that 0 301 25
he 0 301 25
controls 0 301 25
him 0 301 25
with 0 301 25
blackmail, 0 301 25
is 0 301 25
the 0 301 25
kind 0 301 25
of 0 301 25
stuff 0 301 25
that 0 301 25
you 0 301 25
believe 0 301 25
if 0 301 25
you 0 301 25

Tom 0 301 26

The 0 301 27

that 0 301 27
I 0 301 27

is 0 301 27
that, 0 301 27
you 0 301 27
know, 0 301 27
again, 0 301 27
this 0 301 27
idea 0 301 27
that 0 301 27
somehow 0 301 27
that 0 301 27
you 0 301 27
are 0 301 27
endorsing 0 301 27
the 0 301 27

of 0 301 27
other 0 301 27

leaders 0 301 27
if 0 301 27
you 0 301 27
meet 0 301 27
with 0 301 27
them—it 0 301 27
is 0 301 27
true 0 301 27
that 0 301 27
Trump 0 301 27
has 0 301 27
never 0 301 27
criticized 0 301 27
Putin, 0 301 27
although 0 301 27
he 0 301 27
has 0 301 27
taken 0 301 27
all 0 301 27
the 0 301 27
steps 0 301 27
I 0 301 27
just 0 301 27
outlined 0 301 27
against 0 301 27
Putin. 0 301 27

But 0 301 28
he’s 0 301 28
also 0 301 28
never 1 301 28
criticized 0 301 28
Benjamin 0 301 28
Netanyahu. 0 301 28

He’s 0 301 29
also 0 301 29
never 1 301 29
criticized 0 301 29
the 0 301 29
incredibly 1 301 29
repressive 1 301 29
leaders 0 301 29
of 0 301 29
Saudi 0 301 29
Arabia. 0 301 29

He’s 0 301 30
never 1 301 30

the 0 301 30
fascist 1 301 30
president 0 301 30
of 0 301 30

It 0 301 31
is 0 301 31
true 0 301 31
President 0 301 31
Trump 0 301 31
likes 0 301 31

and 0 301 31
that 0 301 31
is 0 301 31
a 0 301 31
problem, 0 301 31
but 0 301 31
it’s 0 301 31
not 0 301 31

Putin 0 301 31

expected 0 306 32

campaign 0 306 32
to 0 306 32
be 0 306 32
one 0 306 32
focus 0 306 32
of 0 306 32
the 0 306 32
investigation. 0 306 32

That 0 306 33
gave 0 306 33
the 0 306 33
reins 0 306 33
to 0 306 33
his 0 306 33

who 0 306 33
later 0 306 33
appointed 0 306 33

Trump 0 306 34
has 0 306 34
publicly 0 306 34
criticized 0 306 34
Sessions 0 306 34
before, 0 306 34
tweeting 0 306 34
in 0 306 34
June 0 306 34
that 0 306 34
the 1 306 34
Mueller 1 306 34
‘witch 1 306 34
hunt’ 1 306 34
was 0 306 34
only 0 306 34
proceeding 0 306 34
‘because 0 306 34
Jeff 0 306 34
Sessions 0 306 34
didn’t 0 306 34
tell 0 306 34
me 0 306 34
he 0 306 34
was 0 306 34
going 0 306 34

‘I 0 306 35

So 1 306 36
much 1 306 36
time 1 306 36
and 1 306 36
money 1 306 36
wasted, 1 306 36

The 0 306 37
new 0 306 37

The 0 306 38
allegations 0 306 38
in 0 306 38
that 0 306 38
trial, 0 306 38
which 0 306 38
began 0 306 38

are 0 306 38

in 0 306 38
the 0 306 38

But 0 306 39
firing 0 306 39
Mueller 0 306 39
would 0 306 39
likely 0 306 39
send 0 306 39
a 0 306 39

The 0 78 19
outcome 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
these 0 78 19
two 0 78 19
incidents 0 78 19
was 0 78 19
the 0 78 19
passage 0 78 19
by 0 78 19
Congress 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
the 0 78 19
Gulf 0 78 19

country 0 78 19

be 0 78 19

by 0 78 19
“communist 0 78 19
aggression.” 0 78 19
The 0 78 19
resolution 0 78 19
served 0 78 19
as 0 78 19
Johnson’s 0 78 19
legal 0 78 19

As 0 78 20
a 0 78 20
result, 0 78 20
58,177 0 78 20
Americans 1 78 20
would 0 78 20
lose 0 78 20
their 0 78 20
lives. 0 78 20

Additionally, 0 78 21
over 0 78 21
one 0 78 21

South 0 78 21
Vietnamese, 0 78 21
including 0 78 21
627,000 0 78 21
civilians 0 78 21
would 0 78 21
be 0 78 21

But 0 78 22
it 0 78 22
wasn’t 0 78 22

all. 1 78 23

of 0 78 24

The 0 78 25
truth 0 78 25
of 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
matter 0 78 25
was 0 78 25
that 0 78 25
the 0 78 25

and 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
Laotian 0 78 25

When 0 78 26
the 0 78 26
government 0 78 26
announced 0 78 26
that 0 78 26
it 0 78 26
had 0 78 26
been 0 78 26
the 0 78 26
victim 0 78 26
of 0 78 26
an 0 78 26
unprovoked 0 78 26
attack—this 0 78 26
was 0 78 26
a 0 78 26
lie. 0 78 26

In 0 78 27
the 0 78 27
2003 0 78 27

Robert 0 78 27
S. 0 78 27

that 0 78 27
the 0 78 27

In 0 78 28
1995, 0 78 28

met 0 78 28
with 0 78 28

happened 0 78 28
on 0 78 28
August 0 78 28
4, 0 78 28
1964 0 78 28
in 0 78 28

Incident. 0 78 28

“Absolutely 0 78 29
nothing”, 0 78 29
Giáp 0 78 29
replied. 0 78 29

Giáp 0 78 30
claimed 0 78 30
that 0 78 30
the 0 78 30
attack 0 78 30
had 0 78 30
been 0 78 30
imaginary. 0 78 30

In 0 78 31
2010, 0 78 31
more 0 78 31

1,100 0 78 31
transcripts 0 78 31
from 0 78 31
the 0 78 31
Vietnam 0 78 31
era 0 78 31
were 0 78 31
released, 0 78 31
proving 0 78 31
Congress 0 78 31
and 0 78 31
officials 0 78 31
raised 0 78 31
serious 0 78 31
doubts 0 78 31
about 0 78 31
the 0 78 31

But 0 78 32
while 0 78 32
this 0 78 32
internal 0 78 32
grumbling 0 78 32
took 0 78 32
place, 0 78 32
mainstream 0 78 32

dutifully 0 78 32
reported 0 78 32

the 0 78 32

egregiously 0 78 33

in 0 78 33
“almost 0 78 33

If 0 78 34
due 0 78 34

had 0 78 34
been 0 78 34
performed, 0 78 34

about 0 78 34

false 0 78 34

it’s 0 78 34
arguable 0 78 34
whether 0 78 34
support 0 78 34
for 0 78 34
the 0 78 34
contentious 0 78 34

Now, 0 78 35

“I 0 78 36

needs 0 78 36
to 0 78 36

The 0 317 23

he 0 317 23
was 0 317 23
unaware 0 317 23

the 0 317 23
children 0 317 23
for 0 317 23

shootings, 0 317 23
but 0 317 23
his 0 317 23
mosque 0 317 23
has 0 317 23
been 0 317 23
known 0 317 23
to 0 317 23

Islamic 1 317 23
jihadis 1 317 23
over 0 317 23
the 0 317 23

"It 0 317 24
sounds 0 317 24
to 0 317 24
me 0 317 24
it 1 317 24

crazy. 1 317 24

But 0 317 25
I 1 317 25
don't 1 317 25

"I 1 317 26

the 0 317 28

is 0 317 28

Muslims 0 317 28
are 0 317 28

that 0 317 28
this 1 317 28
was 1 317 28
nothing 1 317 28
more 1 317 28
than 1 317 28
a 1 317 28
"domestic 1 317 28

"None 0 317 29

"Because 1 317 30
it's 1 317 30

the 1 317 30
circumstances 1 317 30
that 1 317 30

the 1 317 39

that 1 317 39

It 1 317 40
is 1 317 40
a 1 317 40
totalitarian, 1 317 40

that 1 317 40

avail: 0 319 4
Archbishop 0 319 4
McCarrick 0 319 4
was 0 319 4
nonetheless 0 319 4
“promoted” 0 319 4
to 0 319 4
become 0 319 4
the 0 319 4
archbishop 0 319 4
in 0 319 4
our 1 319 4
nation’s 1 319 4
capital, 0 319 4
and 0 319 4
elevated 0 319 4
to 0 319 4
the 0 319 4
College 0 319 4
of 0 319 4
Cardinals. 0 319 4

While 0 319 5
I 0 319 5
realize 0 319 5
that 0 319 5
it 0 319 5
is 0 319 5
not 0 319 5
always 0 319 5
easy 0 319 5
to 0 319 5
evaluate 0 319 5
the 0 319 5
credibility 0 319 5
of 0 319 5
those 0 319 5
bringing 0 319 5
allegations, 0 319 5
and 0 319 5
that 0 319 5
there’s 0 319 5
often 0 319 5
a 0 319 5
tendency 0 319 5
to 0 319 5
believe 0 319 5
those 0 319 5
we 0 319 5
know 0 319 5
over 0 319 5
those 0 319 5
we 0 319 5
don’t, 0 319 5
I 1 319 5
don’t 1 319 5
think 1 319 5
that 1 319 5
the 1 319 5
Church 1 319 5
in 1 319 5
the 1 319 5
United 1 319 5
States 1 319 5
will 1 319 5
rest 1 319 5
— 1 319 5
and 1 319 5
confidence 1 319 5
will 1 319 5
be 1 319 5
restored 1 319 5
— 1 319 5
until 1 319 5
the 1 319 5
matter 1 319 5
is 1 319 5
independently 1 319 5
investigated 1 319 5
and 1 319 5
explained, 1 319 5
and 1 319 5
assurances 1 319 5
are 1 319 5
given 1 319 5
that 1 319 5
there 1 319 5
are 1 319 5
safeguards 1 319 5
in 1 319 5
place 1 319 5
to 1 319 5
make 1 319 5
sure 1 319 5
that 1 319 5
something 1 319 5
like 1 319 5
this 1 319 5
couldn’t 1 319 5
happen 1 319 5
again. 1 319 5

The 0 319 6
matter 0 319 6
has 0 319 6
been 0 319 6
particularly 0 319 6
troubling 0 319 6
to 0 319 6
me 0 319 6
personally 0 319 6
due 0 319 6
to 0 319 6
the 0 319 6
fact 0 319 6
that 0 319 6
I 0 319 6
had 0 319 6
served 0 319 6
in 0 319 6
the 0 319 6
Archdiocese 0 319 6
of 0 319 6
Newark 0 319 6
as 0 319 6
coadjutor 0 319 6
archbishop 0 319 6
from 0 319 6
November 0 319 6
4, 0 319 6
2013, 0 319 6
to 0 319 6
March 0 319 6
25, 0 319 6
2016, 0 319 6
when 0 319 6
I 0 319 6
was 0 319 6
named 0 319 6
archbishop 0 319 6
here. 0 319 6

It 0 319 7
was 0 319 7
while 0 319 7
I 0 319 7
was 0 319 7
in 0 319 7
Newark 0 319 7
that 0 319 7
I 0 319 7
was 0 319 7
introduced 0 319 7
to 0 319 7
then-Cardinal 0 319 7
McCarrick. 0 319 7

A 0 319 8
number 0 319 8
of 0 319 8
good 1 319 8
Catholics 1 319 8
have 0 319 8
written 0 319 8
to 0 319 8
ask 0 319 8
for 0 319 8
a 0 319 8
personal 0 319 8
accounting 0 319 8
on 0 319 8
my 0 319 8
part, 0 319 8
inquiring 0 319 8
whether 0 319 8
I 0 319 8
was 0 319 8
made 0 319 8
aware 0 319 8
in 0 319 8
my 0 319 8
time 0 319 8
in 0 319 8
Newark 0 319 8
of 0 319 8
the 0 319 8
2005 0 319 8
and 0 319 8
2007 0 319 8
settlements 0 319 8
involving 0 319 8
Archbishop 0 319 8
McCarrick, 0 319 8
or 0 319 8
if 0 319 8
I 0 319 8
knew 0 319 8
of 0 319 8
any 0 319 8
allegations 0 319 8
against 0 319 8
him. 0 319 8

I 0 319 9
can 0 319 9
state 0 319 9
unequivocally 0 319 9
that 0 319 9
I 0 319 9
learned 0 319 9
of 0 319 9
those 0 319 9
settlements 0 319 9
only 0 319 9
in 0 319 9
June 0 319 9
of 0 319 9
this 0 319 9
year, 0 319 9
as 0 319 9
news 0 319 9
broke 0 319 9
about 0 319 9
the 0 319 9
unrelated 0 319 9
claim 0 319 9
that 0 319 9
had 0 319 9
been 0 319 9
filed 0 319 9
in 0 319 9
the 0 319 9
Archdiocese 0 319 9
of 0 319 9
New 0 319 9
York. 0 319 9

What 0 319 10
I 0 319 10
know 0 319 10
of 0 319 10
the 0 319 10
settlements 0 319 10
I 0 319 10
know 0 319 10
from 0 319 10
the 0 319 10
newspapers. 0 319 10

When 0 319 11
serving 0 319 11
in 0 319 11
Newark, 0 319 11
I 0 319 11
was 0 319 11
regularly 0 319 11
briefed 0 319 11
on 0 319 11
current 0 319 11
legal 0 319 11
matters 0 319 11
of 0 319 11
all 0 319 11
sorts, 0 319 11
but 0 319 11
not 0 319 11
on 0 319 11
past 0 319 11
legal 0 319 11
matters 0 319 11
(unless 0 319 11
they 0 319 11
were 0 319 11
still 0 319 11
being 0 319 11
discussed 0 319 11
in 0 319 11
the 0 319 11
press). 0 319 11

By 0 319 12
the 0 319 12
time 0 319 12
I 0 319 12
arrived 0 319 12
in 0 319 12
Newark 0 319 12
in 0 319 12
November 0 319 12
2013, 0 319 12
the 1 319 12
2005 1 319 12
and 1 319 12
2007 1 319 12
settlements 1 319 12
were 1 319 12
apparently 1 319 12
considered 1 319 12
ancient 1 319 12
history. 1 319 12

It 0 319 13
would 0 319 13
be 0 319 13
untrue 0 319 13
to 0 319 13
state 0 319 13
that 0 319 13
I 0 319 13
had 0 319 13
never 0 319 13
heard 0 319 13
any 0 319 13
allegations 0 319 13
about 0 319 13
Cardinal 0 319 13
McCarrick. 0 319 13

Years 0 319 14
before 0 319 14
I 0 319 14
ever 0 319 14
lived 0 319 14
in 0 319 14
Newark, 0 319 14
and 0 319 14
never 0 319 14
imagining 0 319 14
that 0 319 14
I 0 319 14
would 0 319 14
be 0 319 14
assigned 0 319 14
there, 0 319 14
I 0 319 14
had 0 319 14
indeed 0 319 14
read 0 319 14
— 0 319 14
as 0 319 14
a 1 319 14
somewhat 1 319 14
geeky 1 319 14
ex-lawyer 1 319 14
— 0 319 14
an 0 319 14
allegation 0 319 14
about 0 319 14
Cardinal 0 319 14
McCarrick 0 319 14
in 0 319 14
the 0 319 14
context 0 319 14
of 0 319 14
a 0 319 14
2005 0 319 14
lawsuit 0 319 14
in 0 319 14
the 0 319 14
Southern 0 319 14
District 0 319 14
of 0 319 14
New 0 319 14
York 0 319 14
against 0 319 14
Archbishop 0 319 14
Myers, 0 319 14
Cardinal 0 319 14
Eagan, 0 319 14
Bishop 0 319 14
Hubbard 0 319 14
and 0 319 14
the 0 319 14
Irish 0 319 14
Christian 0 319 14
Brothers. 0 319 14

While 0 319 15
the 0 319 15
complaint 0 319 15
didn’t 0 319 15
supply 0 319 15
any 0 319 15
details, 0 319 15
the 0 319 15
plaintiff 0 319 15
was 0 319 15
reported 0 319 15
to 0 319 15
have 0 319 15
said 0 319 15
to 0 319 15
a 0 319 15
journalist 0 319 15
that 0 319 15
“Archbishop 0 319 15
McCarrick 0 319 15
would 0 319 15
share 0 319 15
a 0 319 15
bed 0 319 15
with 0 319 15
seminarians 0 319 15
but 0 319 15
not 0 319 15
engage 0 319 15
in 0 319 15
any 0 319 15
activity 0 319 15
with 0 319 15
them.” 0 319 15
The 0 319 15
complaint 0 319 15
would 0 319 15
later 0 319 15
be 0 319 15
formally 0 319 15
amended 0 319 15
to 0 319 15
include 0 319 15
that 0 319 15
allegation. 0 319 15

Knowing, 0 319 16
however, 0 319 16
that 0 319 16
this 0 319 16
lawsuit 0 319 16
was 0 319 16
completely 0 319 16
dismissed 0 319 16
by 0 319 16
the 0 319 16
state 0 319 16
and 0 319 16
federal 0 319 16
courts, 0 319 16
I 0 319 16
never 0 319 16
gave 0 319 16
the 0 319 16
particular 0 319 16
allegation 0 319 16
about 0 319 16
Cardinal 0 319 16
McCarrick 0 319 16
any 0 319 16
credence. 0 319 16

I 0 319 17
can 0 319 17
also 0 319 17
state 0 319 17
without 0 319 17
exception 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
no 0 319 17
one 0 319 17
in 0 319 17
my 0 319 17
years 0 319 17
in 0 319 17
Newark 0 319 17
ever 0 319 17
told 0 319 17
me 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
they 0 319 17
were 0 319 17
improperly 0 319 17
touched 0 319 17
by 0 319 17
Archbishop 0 319 17
McCarrick, 0 319 17
and 0 319 17
no 0 319 17
one 0 319 17
ever 0 319 17
told 0 319 17
me 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
they 0 319 17
had 0 319 17
to 0 319 17
share 0 319 17
a 0 319 17
bed 0 319 17
with 0 319 17
him 0 319 17
or 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
they 0 319 17
had 0 319 17
seen 0 319 17
anyone 0 319 17
share 0 319 17
a 0 319 17
bed 0 319 17
with 0 319 17
him. 0 319 17

I 0 319 18
heard 0 319 18
lots 0 319 18
of 0 319 18
gut-wrenching 1 319 18
stories 1 319 18
in 0 319 18
my 0 319 18
two-and-a-half 0 319 18
years 0 319 18
there, 0 319 18
but 0 319 18
none 0 319 18
of 0 319 18
them 0 319 18
involved 0 319 18
Archbishop 0 319 18
McCarrick. 0 319 18

With 0 319 19
St. 0 319 19
John 0 319 19
Paul 0 319 19
II’s 0 319 19
1995 0 319 19
visit, 0 319 19
he 0 319 19
was 0 319 19
remembered 0 319 19
for 0 319 19
“bringing 1 319 19
a 1 319 19
saint 1 319 19
to 1 319 19
Newark,” 1 319 19
not 0 319 19
as 0 319 19
an 1 319 19
abuser 1 319 19
of 1 319 19
seminarians, 1 319 19
minors 1 319 19
or 1 319 19
priests. 1 319 19

When 0 319 20
I 0 319 20
was 0 319 20
installed 0 319 20
here 0 319 20
in 0 319 20
St. 0 319 20
Paul, 0 319 20
he 0 319 20
joined 0 319 20
me 0 319 20
at 0 319 20
lunch 0 319 20
along 0 319 20
with 0 319 20
my 0 319 20
father, 0 319 20
sister, 0 319 20
godmother 0 319 20
and 0 319 20
then 0 319 20
12-year-old 0 319 20
nephew. 0 319 20

I 0 319 21
can 0 319 21
assure 0 319 21
you 0 319 21
that 0 319 21
I 0 319 21
would 0 319 21
never 0 319 21
have 0 319 21
allowed 0 319 21
that 0 319 21
to 0 319 21
happen 0 319 21
if 0 319 21
I 0 319 21
had 0 319 21
any 0 319 21
reason 0 319 21
to 0 319 21
know 0 319 21
or 0 319 21
even 0 319 21
suspect 0 319 21
the 0 319 21
things 0 319 21
that 0 319 21
have 0 319 21
been 0 319 21
reported 0 319 21
in 0 319 21
the 0 319 21
newspapers 0 319 21
this 0 319 21
past 0 319 21
month. 0 319 21

While 0 319 22
the 0 319 22
letters 0 319 22
and 0 319 22
emails 0 319 22
of 0 319 22
recent 0 319 22
days 0 319 22
are 0 319 22
sober 1 319 22
reminders 1 319 22
that 0 319 22
there’s 0 319 22
still 0 319 22
a 0 319 22
long 0 319 22
way 0 319 22
to 0 319 22
go 0 319 22
in 0 319 22
restoring 0 319 22
trust, 0 319 22
I 0 319 22
nonetheless 0 319 22
welcome 0 319 22
the 0 319 22
efforts 0 319 22
to 0 319 22
hold 0 319 22
me 0 319 22
accountable 0 319 22
to 0 319 22
you, 0 319 22
the 0 319 22
faithful 0 319 22
of 0 319 22
this 0 319 22
archdiocese. 0 319 22

The 0 319 23
events 0 319 23
of 0 319 23
these 0 319 23
past 0 319 23
weeks 0 319 23
have 0 319 23
shown 0 319 23
that 0 319 23
no 1 319 23
one 1 319 23
can 1 319 23
be 1 319 23
above 1 319 23
the 1 319 23
law, 1 319 23
regardless 1 319 23
of 1 319 23
rank 1 319 23
or 1 319 23
privilege. 1 319 23

I 0 319 24
was 0 319 24
grateful 0 319 24
for 0 319 24
the 0 319 24
opportunity 0 319 24
to 0 319 24
reinforce 0 319 24
that 0 319 24
with 0 319 24
our 0 319 24
seminarians 0 319 24
this 0 319 24
past 0 319 24
weekend, 0 319 24
and 0 319 24
I 0 319 24
look 0 319 24
forward 0 319 24
to 0 319 24
continuing 0 319 24
my 0 319 24
work 0 319 24
with 0 319 24
the 0 319 24
Office 0 319 24
of 0 319 24
Ministerial 0 319 24
Standards 0 319 24
and 0 319 24
Safe 0 319 24
Environment, 0 319 24
and 0 319 24
our 0 319 24
Archdiocesan 0 319 24
Review 0 319 24
Board, 0 319 24

REMNANT 0 319 26
COMMENT: 0 319 26
While 0 319 26
we 0 319 26
certainly 0 319 26
appreciate 0 319 26
His 0 319 26
Excellency's 0 319 26
candid 1 319 26
explanation 1 319 26
of 0 319 26
what 0 319 26
he 0 319 26
knew 0 319 26
and 0 319 26
did 0 319 26
not 0 319 26
know 0 319 26
about 0 319 26
this 0 319 26
horrific 1 319 26
scandal 1 319 26
in 0 319 26
the 0 319 26
Church, 0 319 26
we 1 319 26
would 1 319 26
also 1 319 26
humbly 1 319 26
beg 1 319 26
him 1 319 26
to 1 319 26
take 1 319 26
it 1 319 26
one 1 319 26
step 1 319 26
further 1 319 26
by 1 319 26
publicly 1 319 26
proclaiming 1 319 26
his 1 319 26
profession 1 319 26
of 1 319 26
belief 1 319 26
in 1 319 26
the 1 319 26
Church's 1 319 26
official 1 319 26
teaching 1 319 26
against 1 319 26
the 1 319 26
mortal 1 319 26
sin 1 319 26
of 1 319 26
homosexual 1 319 26
acts 1 319 26
and 1 319 26
the 1 319 26
so-called 1 319 26
"gay 1 319 26
lifestyle," 1 319 26
which 1 319 26
includes 1 319 26
her 1 319 26
long-held 1 319 26
teaching 1 319 26
that 1 319 26
homosexual 1 319 26
activity 1 319 26
between 1 319 26
clerics 1 319 26
is 1 319 26
an 1 319 26
ecclesiastical 1 319 26
crime. 1 319 26

Far 0 319 27
from 0 319 27
being 0 319 27
reassured 0 319 27
of 0 319 27
this 0 319 27
by 0 319 27
their 0 319 27
bishops, 0 319 27
many 0 319 27
Catholic 0 319 27
faithful 0 319 27
today 0 319 27
are 0 319 27
informed 0 319 27
that 0 319 27
the 0 319 27
modern 0 319 27
Catholic 0 319 27
Church 0 319 27
is 0 319 27
now 0 319 27
an 1 319 27
"inclusive 1 319 27
community" 1 319 27
that 1 319 27
"welcomes 1 319 27
all" 1 319 27
and 1 319 27
"judges 1 319 27
none." 1 319 27

All 1 319 28
very 1 319 28
well 1 319 28
and 1 319 28
good, 1 319 28
except 1 319 28
for 1 319 28
the 1 319 28
fact 1 319 28
that 1 319 28
the 1 319 28
Church's 1 319 28
constant 1 319 28
and 1 319 28
unchanging 1 319 28
moral 1 319 28
teaching 1 319 28
on 1 319 28
this 1 319 28
makes 1 319 28
no 1 319 28
such 1 319 28
allowance. 1 319 28

In 0 319 29
fact, 0 319 29
this 0 319 29
binding 0 319 29
and 0 319 29
constant 0 319 29
teaching 0 319 29
of 0 319 29
the 0 319 29
Church 0 319 29
was 0 319 29
reaffirmed 0 319 29
most 0 319 29
recently 0 319 29
in 0 319 29
her 0 319 29
most 0 319 29
authoritative 0 319 29
modern 0 319 29
catechism, 0 319 29
which 0 319 29
holds 0 319 29
the 0 319 29
exact 0 319 29
opposite 0 319 29
position 0 319 29
from 0 319 29
that 0 319 29
apparently 0 319 29
held 0 319 29
by 0 319 29
many 0 319 29
bishops: 0 319 29

Homosexuality 0 319 30
refers 0 319 30
to 0 319 30

itself 1 319 30
on 1 319 30

Scripture, 1 319 30
which 1 319 30
presents 1 319 30
homosexual 1 319 30
acts 1 319 30
as 1 319 30
acts 1 319 30
of 1 319 30

depravity, 1 319 30
tradition 1 319 30
has 1 319 30
always 1 319 30
declared 1 319 30
that 1 319 30
"homosexual 1 319 30
acts 1 319 30
are 1 319 30
intrinsically 1 319 30
disordered." 1 319 30

They 1 319 31
are 1 319 31
contrary 1 319 31
to 1 319 31
the 1 319 31
natural 1 319 31
law. 1 319 31

They 1 319 32
close 1 319 32
the 1 319 32
sexual 1 319 32
act 1 319 32
to 1 319 32
the 1 319 32
gift 1 319 32
of 1 319 32
life. 1 319 32

They 1 319 33
do 1 319 33
not 1 319 33
proceed 1 319 33
from 1 319 33
a 1 319 33
genuine 1 319 33
affective 1 319 33
and 1 319 33
sexual 1 319 33
complementarity. 1 319 33

Under 1 319 34
no 1 319 34

they 1 319 34
be 1 319 34
approved. 1 319 34

Under 1 319 36
no 1 319 36

for 1 319 36

in 1 319 36

who 1 319 36
apparently 1 319 36
think 1 319 36

“Letter 0 319 37

Bishops 0 319 37

Pastoral 0 319 37
Care 0 319 37
of 0 319 37
Homosexual 0 319 37
Persons”: 0 319 37

Although 0 319 38
the 0 319 38
particular 0 319 38
inclination 0 319 38
of 0 319 38
the 0 319 38
homosexual 0 319 38
person 0 319 38
is 0 319 38
not 0 319 38
a 0 319 38
sin, 0 319 38
it 0 319 38
is 0 319 38
a 0 319 38
more 0 319 38
or 0 319 38
less 0 319 38
strong 0 319 38
tendency 0 319 38
ordered 0 319 38
toward 0 319 38
an 0 319 38
intrinsic 0 319 38
moral 0 319 38
evil; 0 319 38
thus 1 319 38
the 1 319 38
inclination 1 319 38
itself 1 319 38
must 1 319 38
be 1 319 38
seen 1 319 38
as 1 319 38
an 1 319 38
objective 1 319 38
disorder. 1 319 38

Therefore 1 319 39
special 1 319 39
concern 1 319 39
and 1 319 39
pastoral 1 319 39
attention 1 319 39
should 1 319 39
be 1 319 39
directed 1 319 39
to 1 319 39
those 1 319 39
who 1 319 39
have 1 319 39
this 1 319 39
condition, 1 319 39
lest 1 319 39
they 1 319 39
be 1 319 39
led 1 319 39
to 1 319 39
believe 1 319 39
that 1 319 39
the 1 319 39
living 1 319 39

this 1 319 39
orientation 1 319 39
in 1 319 39
homosexual 1 319 39
activity 1 319 39
is 1 319 39
a 1 319 39
morally 1 319 39
acceptable 1 319 39
option. 1 319 39

It 1 319 40
is 1 319 40
not. 1 319 40

Notice 0 319 41
the 0 319 41
late 0 319 41
pope 0 319 41
does 0 319 41
not 0 319 41
say, 0 319 41
“Let 0 319 41
the 0 319 41
practicing 0 319 41

Martin 0 319 41
and 0 319 41
his 0 319 41

implying 0 319 41
on 0 319 41
a 0 319 41
regular 0 319 41
basis 0 319 41
in 0 319 41
the 0 319 41
media. 0 319 41

Does 0 319 42
Archbishop 0 319 42
Hebda 0 319 42
believe 0 319 42
it 0 319 42
is 0 319 42
time 0 319 42
for 0 319 42
the 0 319 42
Church 0 319 42
to 0 319 42
stop 1 319 42
humiliating 1 319 42
herself 1 319 42
by 1 319 42
stooping 1 319 42
to 1 319 42
accommodate 1 319 42
a 1 319 42
special 1 319 42
interest 1 319 42
group 1 319 42
that 1 319 42
obviously 1 319 42
doesn't 1 319 42
care 1 319 42
about 1 319 42
her 1 319 42
or 1 319 42
the 1 319 42
moral 1 319 42
code 1 319 42
by 1 319 42
which 1 319 42
she 1 319 42
governs? 1 319 42

Does 0 319 43
he 0 319 43
believe 0 319 43
that 0 319 43
all 0 319 43
Catholics 0 319 43
must 0 319 43
follow 0 319 43
the 0 319 43
rules 0 319 43
of 0 319 43
the 0 319 43
Church 0 319 43
pertaining 0 319 43
to 0 319 43
the 0 319 43
Sixth 0 319 43
Commandment...or 0 319 43
just 0 319 43
the 1 319 43
straight 1 319 43
Catholics? 1 319 43

Does 0 319 44
His 0 319 44
Excellency 0 319 44
believe 0 319 44
that 0 319 44
if 0 319 44
some 0 319 44
homosexual 0 319 44
Catholics 0 319 44
feel 0 319 44
they 0 319 44
need 0 319 44
not 0 319 44
bother 0 319 44
following 0 319 44
the 0 319 44
rules 0 319 44
they 0 319 44
should 0 319 44
be 0 319 44
warmly 0 319 44
welcomed 0 319 44
into 0 319 44
our 0 319 44
"Catholic 0 319 44
Christian" 0 319 44
community 0 319 44
anyway, 0 319 44
even 0 319 44
if 0 319 44
they 0 319 44
are 0 319 44
in 0 319 44
same-sex 0 319 44
unions? 0 319 44

Pope 0 319 45
John 0 319 45
Paul 0 319 45
certainly 0 319 45
didn't 0 319 45
accept 0 319 45
that. 0 319 45

In 0 319 46

Memory 0 319 46

John 0 319 46
Paul 0 319 46
referred 0 319 46
to 0 319 46

“ideology 1 319 46

insisting 0 319 46
of 0 319 46
so-called 0 319 46
'gay 0 319 46

that: 0 319 46

“It 0 319 47
is 0 319 47
legitimate 0 319 47

necessary 0 319 47
to 0 319 47
ask 0 319 47
oneself 0 319 47
if 0 319 47
this 0 319 47
is 0 319 47
not 0 319 47
perhaps 0 319 47
part 0 319 47
of 0 319 47
a 1 319 47
new 1 319 47
ideology 1 319 47
of 1 319 47
evil, 1 319 47
perhaps 0 319 47
more 1 319 47
insidious 1 319 47
and 0 319 47
hidden, 0 319 47
which 0 319 47
attempts 0 319 47

his 1 319 49
pals 1 319 49

not 1 319 50
so 1 319 50
that 1 319 50
it 1 319 50
is 1 319 50
both 1 319 50
negligent 1 319 50
and 1 319 50
uncharitable 1 319 50
for 1 319 50
some 1 319 50
bishops 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
refuse 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
inform 1 319 50
their 1 319 50
faithful 1 319 50
that 1 319 50
according 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
the 1 319 50
Church's 1 319 50
own 1 319 50
infallible 1 319 50
teaching, 1 319 50
everlasting 1 319 50
damnation 1 319 50
is 1 319 50
the 1 319 50
price 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
be 1 319 50
paid 1 319 50
for 1 319 50
this 1 319 50
kind 1 319 50
of 1 319 50
inclusivity 1 319 50
and 1 319 50
toleration? 1 319 50

And 0 319 51
if 0 319 51
the 0 319 51
episcopal 0 319 51
retort 0 319 51
is 0 319 51
going 0 319 51
to 0 319 51
be 0 319 51
that 0 319 51
this 0 319 51
acceptance 0 319 51
refers 0 319 51
only 0 319 51
to 0 319 51
chaste 0 319 51
homosexuals, 0 319 51
then 0 319 51
we 1 319 51
call 1 319 51
FOUL 1 319 51
even 1 319 51
louder 1 319 51
since 0 319 51
this 0 319 51
crosses 0 319 51
the 0 319 51
line 0 319 51
into 0 319 51
willful 1 319 51
deception. 1 319 51

We're 1 319 52
all 1 319 52
sinners, 1 319 52
of 1 319 52
course--- 1 319 52
and 0 319 52
the 0 319 52
Church 0 319 52
already 0 319 52
accepts 0 319 52
repentant 0 319 52
homosexuals 0 319 52
as 0 319 52
they 0 319 52
are, 0 319 52
just 0 319 52
as 0 319 52
she 0 319 52
accepts 0 319 52
repentant 0 319 52
practitioners 0 319 52
of 0 319 52
ANY 1 319 52
sins 1 319 52
of 1 319 52
the 1 319 52
flesh. 1 319 52

So 1 319 53
why 1 319 53
are 1 319 53
our 1 319 53
bishops 1 319 53
playing 1 319 53
dumb? 1 319 53

Quite 1 319 54
obviously, 1 319 54
it 1 319 54
is 1 319 54
because 1 319 54
what 1 319 54
they 1 319 54
are 1 319 54
actually 1 319 54
closing 1 319 54
an 1 319 54
episcopal 1 319 54
eye 1 319 54
to 1 319 54
are 1 319 54
the 1 319 54
folks 1 319 54
who 1 319 54
want 1 319 54
to 1 319 54
keep 1 319 54
right 1 319 54
on 1 319 54
sinning--and 1 319 54
sinning 1 319 54
proudly. 1 319 54

This 1 319 55
is 1 319 55
what 1 319 55
the 1 319 55
Church 1 319 55
of 1 319 55
Accompaniment 1 319 55
is 1 319 55
all 1 319 55
about! 1 319 55

But, 0 319 56
practically 0 319 56
speaking--in 0 319 56
the 0 319 56
real 0 319 56
world--this 0 319 56
kind 0 319 56
of 0 319 56
"accompaniment" 0 319 56
is 0 319 56
only 0 319 56
green-lighting 1 319 56
vice 1 319 56
and 1 319 56
mortal 1 319 56
sin, 1 319 56
and 0 319 56
as 0 319 56
such 0 319 56
constitutes 0 319 56
a 1 319 56
hideous 1 319 56
violation 1 319 56
of 1 319 56
everything 1 319 56
these 1 319 56
bishops 1 319 56
supposedly 1 319 56
believe 1 319 56
as 1 319 56
Catholic 1 319 56
priests. 1 319 56

So 0 319 57
what's 0 319 57
going 0 319 57
on 0 319 57
here? 0 319 57

Who 1 319 58
are 1 319 58
these 1 319 58
bishops 1 319 58
that 1 319 58
think 1 319 58
they 1 319 58
can 1 319 58
play 1 319 58
fast 1 319 58
and 1 319 58
loose 1 319 58
not 1 319 58
only 1 319 58
with 1 319 58
the 1 319 58
moral 1 319 58
theology 1 319 58
of 1 319 58
the 1 319 58
Catholic 1 319 58
Church, 1 319 58
but 1 319 58
also 1 319 58
with 1 319 58
the 1 319 58
immortal 1 319 58
souls 1 319 58
of 1 319 58
their 1 319 58
flock? 1 319 58

Is 1 319 59
it 1 319 59
any 1 319 59
wonder 1 319 59
that 1 319 59
priests 1 319 59
and 1 319 59
laity 1 319 59
alike 1 319 59
are 1 319 59
changing 1 319 59
their 1 319 59
attitude 1 319 59
on 1 319 59
the 1 319 59
"gay 1 319 59
lifestyle" 1 319 59
and 1 319 59
violations 1 319 59
of 1 319 59
the 1 319 59
Sixth 1 319 59
Commandment 1 319 59
when 1 319 59
so 1 319 59
many 1 319 59
bishops 1 319 59
are 1 319 59
working 1 319 59
to 1 319 59
remove 1 319 59
the 1 319 59
stigma 1 319 59
attached 1 319 59
to 1 319 59
this 1 319 59
sin 1 319 59
that 1 319 59
Scripture 1 319 59
tells 1 319 59
us 1 319 59
cries 1 319 59
to 1 319 59
heaven 1 319 59
for 1 319 59
vengeance? 1 319 59

The 1 319 60
Catholic 1 319 60
Church's 1 319 60
new-found 1 319 60
"climate 1 319 60
of 1 319 60
tolerance" 1 319 60
is 1 319 60
exactly 1 319 60
what 1 319 60
McCarrick 1 319 60
and 1 319 60
company 1 319 60
are 1 319 60
counting 1 319 60
on! 1 319 60

It 1 319 61
is 1 319 61
truly 1 319 61
homophobic 1 319 61
for 1 319 61
any 1 319 61
bishop 1 319 61
to 1 319 61
lie 1 319 61
to 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
gay 1 319 61
community 1 319 61
about 1 319 61
this, 1 319 61
and 1 319 61
to 1 319 61
risk 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
immortal 1 319 61
souls 1 319 61
of 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
sheep 1 319 61
merely 1 319 61
so 1 319 61
that 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
shepherd 1 319 61
might 1 319 61
pride 1 319 61
himself 1 319 61
on 1 319 61
occupying 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
politically 1 319 61
correct 1 319 61
high 1 319 61
ground. 1 319 61

This 1 319 62
is 1 319 62
gross 1 319 62
dereliction 1 319 62
of 1 319 62
duty, 1 319 62
and 1 319 62
we 1 319 62
hope 1 319 62
and 1 319 62
pray 1 319 62
that 1 319 62
all 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
good 1 319 62
U.S. 1 319 62
bishops 1 319 62
would 1 319 62
jump 1 319 62
at 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
opportunity 1 319 62
to 1 319 62
issue 1 319 62
statements 1 319 62
reaffirming 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
Church's 1 319 62
clear 1 319 62
teaching 1 319 62
against 1 319 62
all 1 319 62
sins 1 319 62
of 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
flesh, 1 319 62
homo- 1 319 62
and 1 319 62
heterosexual. 1 319 62

Again, 0 319 63
God 0 319 63
bless 0 319 63
Archbishop 0 319 63
Hebda 0 319 63
for 0 319 63
this 0 319 63
welcome 0 319 63
statement, 0 319 63
and 0 319 63
may 0 319 63
God 0 319 63
grant 0 319 63
him 0 319 63
the 0 319 63
courage 0 319 63
now 0 319 63
to 0 319 63
finish 0 319 63
the 0 319 63
task 0 319 63
by 0 319 63
publicly 0 319 63
reassuring 0 319 63
the 1 319 63
scandalized 1 319 63
faithful 1 319 63
that 0 319 63
it’s 0 319 63
not 0 319 63
just 0 319 63
abuse 0 319 63
of 0 319 63
minors 0 319 63
or 0 319 63
sexual 0 319 63
harassment 0 319 63
that’s 0 319 63
going 0 319 63
on 0 319 63
here. 0 319 63

Our 1 319 64
bishops 1 319 64
must 1 319 64
make 1 319 64
it 1 319 64
absolutely 1 319 64
clear 1 319 64
that 1 319 64
the 1 319 64
Church's 1 319 64
moral 1 319 64
theology 1 319 64
on 1 319 64
homosexuality 1 319 64
will 1 319 64
not 1 319 64
and 1 319 64
can 1 319 64
not 1 319 64
be 1 319 64
trumped 1 319 64
by 1 319 64
the 1 319 64
dictates 1 319 64
of 1 319 64
political 1 319 64
correctness. 1 319 64

And 0 319 65
neither 0 319 65
can 0 319 65
God's 0 319 65
law 0 319 65
be 0 319 65
changed 0 319 65
to 0 319 65
accommodate 0 319 65
the 0 319 65
spirit 0 319 65
of 0 319 65
our 0 319 65
“most 0 319 65
enlightened” 0 319 65
age---which 0 319 65
is, 0 319 65
of 0 319 65
course, 0 319 65
an 1 319 65
evil 1 319 65
spirit 1 319 65
that 1 319 65
can 1 319 65
be 1 319 65
driven 1 319 65
out 1 319 65
only 1 319 65
by 1 319 65
prayer 1 319 65
and 1 319 65
fasting. 1 319 65

Until 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
Church 1 319 66
and 1 319 66
her 1 319 66
bishops 1 319 66
get 1 319 66
back 1 319 66
to 1 319 66
reaffirming 1 319 66
traditional 1 319 66
Catholic 1 319 66
teaching 1 319 66
on 1 319 66
human 1 319 66
sexuality 1 319 66
we 1 319 66
can 1 319 66
forget 1 319 66
about 1 319 66
seeing 1 319 66
an 1 319 66
end 1 319 66
to 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
sexual 1 319 66
abuse 1 319 66
crisis 1 319 66
and 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
massive 1 319 66
problem 1 319 66
of 1 319 66
homosexuality 1 319 66
in 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
clergy. 1 319 66

McCarrick 0 319 66

will 0 319 66

become 0 319 66

the 0 319 66

norm, 0 319 66

not 0 319 66

the 0 319 66

exception, 0 319 66

and 0 319 66

confidence 0 319 66

in 0 319 66

the 0 319 66

authority 0 319 66

of 0 319 66

the 0 319 66

Catholic 0 319 66

will 1 319 66

remain 1 319 66

in 1 319 66

indefinitely... 1 319 66

It’s 0 320 1
noteworthy 0 320 1
that 0 320 1
AP 0 320 1
would 0 320 1
carry 0 320 1
this 0 320 1
story 0 320 1
at 0 320 1
all; 0 320 1
certainly, 0 320 1
neither 0 320 1
AP 0 320 1
nor 0 320 1
the 0 320 1
rest 0 320 1
of 0 320 1
the 0 320 1
establishment 0 320 1
media 0 320 1
is 0 320 1
ever 0 320 1
so 0 320 1
solicitous 0 320 1
of 0 320 1
those 0 320 1
whom 0 320 1
they 0 320 1
smear 1 320 1
as 0 320 1
“anti-Muslim” 1 320 1
to 0 320 1
allow 0 320 1
us 0 320 1
to 0 320 1
tell 0 320 1
our 0 320 1
side 0 320 1
of 0 320 1
the 0 320 1
story. 0 320 1

But 0 320 2
the 0 320 2
imam 0 320 2
Siraj 0 320 2
Wahhaj 0 320 2
is 0 320 2
here 0 320 2
engaging 1 320 2
in 1 320 2
some 1 320 2
“war 1 320 2
is 1 320 2
deceit” 1 320 2
action. 1 320 2

His 0 320 3
son 0 320 3
was 0 320 3
on 0 320 3
the 0 320 3
radar 0 320 3
of 0 320 3
counterterror 0 320 3
officials 0 320 3
for 0 320 3
13 0 320 3

on 0 320 3
suspicion 0 320 3
of 0 320 3

He 0 320 4
was 0 320 4
training 0 320 4

But 1 320 5
of 1 320 5
course, 1 320 5
it’s 1 320 5
all 1 320 5
because 1 320 5
of 1 320 5
journalists 1 320 5
who 1 320 5
supposedly 1 320 5
hate 1 320 5

on 1 320 23
a 1 320 23
contention 1 320 23
by 1 320 23

of 0 323 1
the 0 323 1

has 0 323 1
confirmed 0 323 1
several 0 323 1
of 0 323 1
my 0 323 1
children 0 323 1
according 0 323 1
to 0 323 1
the 0 323 1
traditional 0 323 1
Rite 0 323 1
of 0 323 1

as 0 323 1
his 0 323 1
diocese 0 323 1
has 0 323 1
been 0 323 1
a 1 323 1
port 1 323 1
in 1 323 1
the 1 323 1
storm 1 323 1
for 0 323 1
many 0 323 1
displaced 0 323 1
and 0 323 1
disillusioned 0 323 1
Catholic 0 323 1
families. 0 323 1

We 0 323 2
don’t 0 323 2
see 0 323 2
eye-to-eye 0 323 2
on 0 323 2
everything, 0 323 2
of 0 323 2
course, 0 323 2
but 0 323 2
his 0 323 2
faith 0 323 2
and 0 323 2
pastoral 0 323 2
solicitude 0 323 2
have 0 323 2
for 0 323 2
us 0 323 2
been 0 323 2
a 0 323 2
light 1 323 2
in 1 323 2
the 1 323 2
darkness 1 323 2
and 0 323 2
proof 0 323 2
that 0 323 2
God 0 323 2
has 0 323 2
not 0 323 2
left 0 323 2
us 0 323 2
orphans. 0 323 2

And 0 323 3
now 0 323 3
this, 0 323 3
finally, 0 323 3
a 1 323 3
bishop 1 323 3
with 1 323 3
the 1 323 3
courage 1 323 3
to 1 323 3
look 1 323 3
the 1 323 3
beast 1 323 3
in 1 323 3
the 1 323 3
eye 1 323 3
and 1 323 3
speak 1 323 3
its 1 323 3
name 1 323 3
out 1 323 3
loud. 1 323 3

Bishop 0 323 4
Morlino 0 323 4
does 0 323 4
this 0 323 4
in 0 323 4
a 0 323 4
moment 0 323 4
when 0 323 4
he 0 323 4
is 0 323 4
under 0 323 4
heavy 0 323 4
attack 0 323 4
as 0 323 4
a 1 323 4
“hater” 1 323 4
for 0 323 4
defending 0 323 4
the 0 323 4
Church’s 0 323 4
teaching 0 323 4
on 0 323 4
marriage—an 0 323 4
attack, 0 323 4
by 0 323 4
the 0 323 4
way, 0 323 4
which 0 323 4
prompted 0 323 4
us 0 323 4

"If 0 323 5
you'll 0 323 5
permit 0 323 5
me, 0 323 5
what 0 323 5
the 1 323 5
Church 1 323 5
needs 1 323 5
now 1 323 5
is 1 323 5
more 1 323 5
hatred! 1 323 5

As 0 323 6
I 0 323 6
have 0 323 6
said 0 323 6
previously, 0 323 6
St. 0 323 6
Thomas 0 323 6
Aquinas 0 323 6
said 0 323 6
that 0 323 6
hatred 0 323 6
of 0 323 6
wickedness 0 323 6
actually 0 323 6
belongs 0 323 6
to 0 323 6
the 0 323 6
virtue 0 323 6
of 0 323 6
charity. 0 323 6

As 0 323 7
the 0 323 7
Book 0 323 7
of 0 323 7
Proverbs 0 323 7
says 0 323 7
'My 0 323 7
mouth 0 323 7
shall 0 323 7
meditate 0 323 7
truth, 0 323 7
and 0 323 7
my 0 323 7
lips 0 323 7
shall 0 323 7
hate 0 323 7
wickedness 0 323 7
(Prov. 0 323 7

8:7).' 0 323 8

It 1 323 9
is 1 323 9
an 1 323 9
act 1 323 9
of 1 323 9
love 1 323 9
to 1 323 9
hate 1 323 9
sin 1 323 9
and 1 323 9
to 1 323 9
call 1 323 9
others 1 323 9
to 1 323 9
turn 1 323 9
away 1 323 9
from 1 323 9
sin. 1 323 9

– 0 323 10
Bishop 0 323 10
Robert 0 323 10
Morlino 0 323 10

This 0 323 11
is 0 323 11
what 0 323 11
a 1 323 11
courageous 1 323 11
shepherd 1 323 11
looks 0 323 11
like! 0 323 11

In 1 323 12
our 1 323 12
opinion, 1 323 12
during 1 323 12
the 1 323 12
most 1 323 12
vile 1 323 12
clergy 1 323 12
sex 1 323 12
scandal 1 323 12
in 1 323 12
history, 1 323 12
every 1 323 12
bishop 1 323 12
in 1 323 12
the 1 323 12
country 1 323 12
must 1 323 12
do 1 323 12
exactly 1 323 12
what 1 323 12
Bishop 1 323 12
Morlino 1 323 12
has 1 323 12
done, 1 323 12
i.e., 1 323 12
issue 1 323 12
a 1 323 12
statement 1 323 12
of 1 323 12
fidelity 1 323 12
to 1 323 12
the 1 323 12
Church’s 1 323 12
moral 1 323 12
theology, 1 323 12
specifically 1 323 12
her 1 323 12
teaching 1 323 12
against 1 323 12
the 1 323 12
mortal 1 323 12
sin 1 323 12
of 1 323 12
homosexual 1 323 12
acts. 1 323 12

In 0 323 13
so 0 323 13
doing, 0 323 13
the 0 323 13
bishops 0 323 13
will 0 323 13
incur 0 323 13
the 1 323 13
wrath 1 323 13
of 1 323 13
the 1 323 13
enemies 1 323 13
of 1 323 13
the 1 323 13
Church, 1 323 13
yes. 0 323 13

They 1 323 14
will 1 323 14
be 1 323 14
crucified 1 323 14
in 1 323 14
the 1 323 14
media, 1 323 14
yes. 1 323 14

But 1 323 15
they 1 323 15
will 1 323 15
also 1 323 15
be 1 323 15
doing 1 323 15
their 1 323 15
sacred 1 323 15
duty 1 323 15
before 1 323 15
God 1 323 15
in 1 323 15
reassuring 1 323 15
their 1 323 15
thoroughly 1 323 15
scandalized 1 323 15
flocks 1 323 15
that 1 323 15
they 1 323 15
are 1 323 15
absolutely 1 323 15
committed 1 323 15
to 1 323 15
the 1 323 15
defense 1 323 15
and 1 323 15
enforcement 1 323 15
of 1 323 15
the 1 323 15
Church’s 1 323 15
moral 1 323 15
teaching 1 323 15
at 1 323 15
a 1 323 15
time 1 323 15
when 1 323 15
it 1 323 15
is 1 323 15
under 1 323 15
scurrilous 1 323 15
attack 1 323 15
from 1 323 15
within. 1 323 15

Nothing 1 323 16
less 1 323 16
will 1 323 16
do. 1 323 16

Bishop 0 323 17
Morlino 0 323 17
has 0 323 17
now 0 323 17
done 0 323 17
it, 0 323 17
and 0 323 17
we 1 323 17
respectfully 1 323 17
demand 1 323 17
that 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
rest 1 323 17
of 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
American 1 323 17
bishops 1 323 17
either 1 323 17
follow 1 323 17
suit 1 323 17
or 1 323 17
face 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
charge 1 323 17
of 1 323 17
being 1 323 17
complicit 1 323 17
with 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
degenerate 1 323 17
and 1 323 17
even 1 323 17
criminal 1 323 17
shepherds, 1 323 17
accounts 1 323 17
of 1 323 17
whose 1 323 17
betrayal 1 323 17
and 1 323 17
vice 1 323 17
now 1 323 17

The 0 323 23
past 0 323 23
weeks 0 323 23
have 0 323 23
brought 0 323 23
a 0 323 23
great 0 323 23
deal 0 323 23
of 0 323 23
scandal, 0 323 23
justified 0 323 23
anger, 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
a 0 323 23
call 0 323 23
for 0 323 23
answers 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
action 0 323 23
by 0 323 23
many 0 323 23
faithful 0 323 23
Catholics 0 323 23
here 0 323 23
in 0 323 23
the 0 323 23
U.S. 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
overseas, 0 323 23
directed 0 323 23
at 0 323 23
the 0 323 23
Church 0 323 23
hierarchy 0 323 23
regarding 0 323 23
sexual 0 323 23
sins 0 323 23
by 0 323 23
bishops, 0 323 23
priests, 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
even 0 323 23
cardinals. 0 323 23

Still 0 323 24
more 0 323 24
anger 0 323 24
is 0 323 24
rightly 0 323 24
directed 0 323 24
at 0 323 24
those 0 323 24
who 0 323 24
have 0 323 24
been 0 323 24
complicit 0 323 24
in 0 323 24
keeping 0 323 24
some 0 323 24
of 0 323 24
these 0 323 24
serious 0 323 24
sins 0 323 24
from 0 323 24
coming 0 323 24
to 0 323 24
light. 0 323 24

For 0 323 25
my 0 323 25
part 0 323 25
— 0 323 25
and 0 323 25
I 0 323 25
know 0 323 25
I 0 323 25
am 0 323 25
not 0 323 25
alone 0 323 25
— 0 323 25
I 1 323 25
am 1 323 25
tired 1 323 25
of 1 323 25
this. 1 323 25

I 1 323 26
am 1 323 26
tired 1 323 26
of 0 323 26
people 0 323 26
being 0 323 26
hurt, 0 323 26
gravely 1 323 26
hurt! 1 323 26

I 1 323 27
am 1 323 27
tired 1 323 27
of 0 323 27
the 0 323 27
obfuscation 0 323 27
of 0 323 27
truth. 0 323 27

I 1 323 28
am 1 323 28
tired 1 323 28
of 0 323 28
sin. 0 323 28

And, 0 323 29
as 0 323 29
one 0 323 29
who 0 323 29
has 0 323 29
tried 0 323 29
— 0 323 29
despite 0 323 29
my 0 323 29
many 0 323 29
imperfections 0 323 29
— 0 323 29
to 0 323 29
lay 0 323 29
down 0 323 29
my 0 323 29
life 0 323 29
for 0 323 29
Christ 0 323 29
and 0 323 29
His 0 323 29
Church, 0 323 29
I 1 323 29
am 1 323 29
tired 1 323 29
of 0 323 29
the 0 323 29
regular 0 323 29
violation 0 323 29
of 0 323 29
sacred 0 323 29
duties 0 323 29
by 0 323 29
those 1 323 29
entrusted 1 323 29
with 1 323 29
immense 1 323 29
responsibility 1 323 29
from 1 323 29
the 1 323 29
Lord 1 323 29
for 1 323 29
the 1 323 29
care 1 323 29
of 1 323 29
His 1 323 29
people. 1 323 29

The 0 323 30
stories 0 323 30
being 0 323 30
brought 0 323 30
into 0 323 30
light 0 323 30
and 0 323 30
displayed 0 323 30
in 0 323 30
gruesome 1 323 30
detail 1 323 30
with 0 323 30
regard 0 323 30
to 0 323 30
some 0 323 30
priests, 0 323 30
religious, 0 323 30
and 0 323 30
now 0 323 30
even 0 323 30
those 0 323 30
in 0 323 30
places 0 323 30
of 0 323 30
highest 0 323 30
leadership, 0 323 30
are 0 323 30
sickening. 1 323 30

Hearing 0 323 31
even 0 323 31
one 0 323 31
of 0 323 31
these 0 323 31
stories 0 323 31
is, 0 323 31
quite 1 323 31
literally, 1 323 31
enough 1 323 31
to 1 323 31
make 1 323 31
someone 1 323 31
sick. 1 323 31

But 0 323 32
my 0 323 32
own 0 323 32
sickness 1 323 32
at 0 323 32
the 0 323 32
stories 0 323 32
is 0 323 32
quickly 0 323 32
put 0 323 32
into 0 323 32
perspective 0 323 32
when 0 323 32
I 0 323 32
recall 0 323 32
the 0 323 32
fact 0 323 32
that 0 323 32
many 0 323 32
individuals 0 323 32
have 0 323 32
lived 0 323 32
through 0 323 32
them 0 323 32
for 0 323 32
years. 0 323 32

For 0 323 33
them, 0 323 33
these 0 323 33
are 0 323 33
not 0 323 33
stories, 0 323 33
they 0 323 33
are 0 323 33
indeed 0 323 33
realities. 0 323 33

To 0 323 34
them 0 323 34
I 0 323 34
turn 0 323 34
and 0 323 34
say, 0 323 34
again, 0 323 34
I 0 323 34
am 0 323 34
sorry 0 323 34
for 0 323 34
what 0 323 34
you 0 323 34
have 0 323 34
suffered 0 323 34
and 0 323 34
what 0 323 34
you 0 323 34
continue 0 323 34
to 0 323 34
suffer 0 323 34
in 0 323 34
your 0 323 34
mind 0 323 34
and 0 323 34
in 0 323 34
your 0 323 34
heart. 0 323 34

If 0 323 35
you 0 323 35
have 0 323 35
not 0 323 35
already 0 323 35
done 0 323 35
so, 0 323 35
I 0 323 35
beg 0 323 35
you 0 323 35
to 0 323 35
reach 0 323 35
out, 0 323 35
as 0 323 35
hard 0 323 35
as 0 323 35
that 0 323 35
may 0 323 35
be, 0 323 35
and 0 323 35
seek 0 323 35
help 0 323 35
to 0 323 35
begin 0 323 35
to 0 323 35
heal. 0 323 35

Also, 0 323 36
if 0 323 36
you’ve 0 323 36
been 0 323 36
hurt 0 323 36
by 0 323 36
a 0 323 36
priest 0 323 36
of 0 323 36
our 0 323 36
diocese, 0 323 36
I 0 323 36
encourage 0 323 36
you 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
come 0 323 36
forward, 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
make 0 323 36
a 0 323 36
report 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
law 0 323 36
enforcement 0 323 36
and 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
our 0 323 36
Victim’s 0 323 36
Assistance 0 323 36
Coordinator, 0 323 36
so 0 323 36
that 0 323 36
we 0 323 36
might 0 323 36
begin, 0 323 36
with 0 323 36
you 0 323 36
as 0 323 36
an 0 323 36
individual, 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
try 0 323 36
and 0 323 36
set 0 323 36
things 0 323 36
right 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
the 0 323 36
greatest 0 323 36
extent 0 323 36
possible. 0 323 36

There 0 323 37
is 0 323 37
nothing 0 323 37
about 0 323 37
these 0 323 37
stories 0 323 37
that 0 323 37
is 0 323 37
okay. 0 323 37

These 1 323 38
actions, 1 323 38
committed 1 323 38
by 1 323 38
more 1 323 38
than 1 323 38
a 1 323 38
few, 1 323 38
can 1 323 38
only 1 323 38
be 1 323 38
classified 1 323 38
as 1 323 38
evil, 1 323 38
evil 1 323 38
that 1 323 38
cries 1 323 38
out 1 323 38
for 1 323 38
justice 1 323 38
and 1 323 38
sin 1 323 38
that 1 323 38
must 1 323 38
be 1 323 38
cast 1 323 38
out 1 323 38
from 1 323 38
our 1 323 38
Church. 1 323 38

Faced 0 323 39
with 0 323 39
stories 0 323 39
of 0 323 39
the 0 323 39
depravity 0 323 39
of 0 323 39
sinners 0 323 39
within 0 323 39
the 0 323 39
Church, 0 323 39
I 0 323 39
have 0 323 39
been 0 323 39
tempted 0 323 39
to 0 323 39
despair. 0 323 39

And 0 323 40
why? 0 323 40

The 0 323 41
reality 0 323 41
of 0 323 41
sin 0 323 41
— 0 323 41
even 0 323 41
sin 0 323 41
in 0 323 41
the 0 323 41
Church 0 323 41
— 0 323 41
is 0 323 41
nothing 0 323 41
new. 0 323 41

We 0 323 42
are 0 323 42
a 0 323 42
Church 0 323 42
made 0 323 42
of 0 323 42
sinners, 0 323 42
but 0 323 42
we 0 323 42
are 0 323 42
sinners 0 323 42
called 0 323 42
to 0 323 42
sanctity. 0 323 42

So 0 323 43
what 0 323 43
is 0 323 43
new? 0 323 43

What 0 323 44
is 0 323 44
new 0 323 44
is 0 323 44
the 0 323 44
seeming 0 323 44
acceptance 0 323 44
of 0 323 44
sin 0 323 44
by 0 323 44
some 0 323 44
in 0 323 44
the 0 323 44
Church, 0 323 44
and 0 323 44
the 0 323 44
apparent 0 323 44
efforts 0 323 44
to 0 323 44
cover 0 323 44
over 0 323 44
sin 0 323 44
by 0 323 44
them 0 323 44
and 0 323 44
others. 0 323 44

Unless 1 323 45
and 1 323 45
until 1 323 45
we 1 323 45
take 1 323 45
seriously 1 323 45
our 1 323 45
call 1 323 45
to 1 323 45
sanctity, 1 323 45
we, 1 323 45
as 1 323 45
an 1 323 45
institution 1 323 45
and 1 323 45
as 1 323 45
individuals, 1 323 45
will 1 323 45
continue 1 323 45
to 1 323 45
suffer 1 323 45
the 1 323 45
“wages 1 323 45
of 1 323 45
sin.” 1 323 45

For 0 323 46
too 0 323 46
long 0 323 46
we 0 323 46
have 0 323 46
diminished 0 323 46
the 0 323 46
reality 0 323 46
of 0 323 46
sin 0 323 46
— 0 323 46
we 0 323 46
have 0 323 46
refused 0 323 46
to 0 323 46
call 0 323 46
a 0 323 46
sin 0 323 46
a 0 323 46
sin 1 323 46
— 0 323 46
and 0 323 46
we 1 323 46
have 1 323 46
excused 1 323 46
sin 1 323 46
in 1 323 46
the 1 323 46
name 1 323 46
of 1 323 46
a 1 323 46
mistaken 1 323 46
notion 1 323 46
of 1 323 46
mercy. 1 323 46

In 0 323 47
our 0 323 47
efforts 0 323 47
to 0 323 47
be 0 323 47
open 0 323 47
to 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
world 0 323 47
we 0 323 47
have 0 323 47
become 0 323 47
all 0 323 47
too 0 323 47
willing 0 323 47
to 0 323 47
abandon 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
Way, 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
Truth, 0 323 47
and 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
Life. 0 323 47

In 0 323 48
order 0 323 48
to 0 323 48
avoid 0 323 48
causing 0 323 48
offense 0 323 48
we 0 323 48
offer 0 323 48
to 0 323 48
ourselves 0 323 48
and 0 323 48
to 0 323 48
others 0 323 48
niceties 0 323 48
and 0 323 48
human 0 323 48
consolation. 0 323 48

Why 1 323 49
do 1 323 49
we 1 323 49
do 1 323 49
this? 1 323 49

Is 1 323 50
it 1 323 50
out 1 323 50
of 1 323 50
an 1 323 50
earnest 1 323 50
desire 1 323 50
to 1 323 50
display 1 323 50
a 1 323 50
misguided 1 323 50
sense 1 323 50
of 1 323 50
being 1 323 50
“pastoral?” 1 323 50
Have 1 323 50
we 1 323 50
covered 1 323 50
over 1 323 50
the 1 323 50
truth 1 323 50
out 1 323 50
of 1 323 50
fear? 1 323 50

Are 1 323 51
we 1 323 51
afraid 1 323 51
of 1 323 51
being 1 323 51
disliked 1 323 51
by 1 323 51
people 1 323 51
in 1 323 51
this 1 323 51
world? 1 323 51

Or 1 323 52
are 1 323 52
we 1 323 52
afraid 1 323 52
of 1 323 52
being 1 323 52
called 1 323 52
hypocrites 1 323 52
because 1 323 52
we 1 323 52
are 1 323 52
not 1 323 52
striving 1 323 52
tirelessly 1 323 52
for 1 323 52
holiness 1 323 52
in 1 323 52
our 1 323 52
own 1 323 52
lives? 1 323 52

Perhaps 0 323 53
these 0 323 53
are 0 323 53
the 0 323 53
reasons, 0 323 53
but 0 323 53
perhaps 0 323 53
it 0 323 53
is 0 323 53
more 0 323 53
or 0 323 53
less 0 323 53
complex 0 323 53
than 0 323 53
this. 0 323 53

In 1 323 54
the 1 323 54
end, 1 323 54
the 1 323 54
excuses 1 323 54
do 1 323 54
not 1 323 54
matter. 1 323 54

We 1 323 55
must 1 323 55
be 1 323 55
done 1 323 55
with 1 323 55
sin. 1 323 55

It 1 323 56
must 1 323 56
be 1 323 56
rooted 1 323 56
out 1 323 56
and 1 323 56
again 1 323 56
considered 1 323 56
unacceptable. 1 323 56

Love 0 323 57
sinners? 0 323 57

Yes. 0 323 58

Accept 0 323 59
true 0 323 59
repentance? 0 323 59

Yes. 0 323 60

But 0 323 61
do 0 323 61
not 0 323 61
say 0 323 61
sin 0 323 61
is 0 323 61
okay. 0 323 61

And 0 323 62
do 0 323 62
not 0 323 62
pretend 0 323 62
that 0 323 62
grave 0 323 62
violations 0 323 62
of 0 323 62
office 0 323 62
and 0 323 62
of 0 323 62
trust 0 323 62
come 0 323 62
without 0 323 62
grave, 0 323 62
lasting 0 323 62
consequences. 0 323 62

For 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
Church, 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
crisis 0 323 63
we 0 323 63
face 0 323 63
is 0 323 63
not 0 323 63
limited 0 323 63
to 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
McCarrick 0 323 63
affair, 0 323 63
or 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
Pennsylvania 0 323 63
Grand 0 323 63
Jury 0 323 63
Report, 0 323 63
or 0 323 63
anything 0 323 63
else 0 323 63
that 0 323 63
may 0 323 63
come. 0 323 63

The 0 323 64
deeper 0 323 64
crisis 0 323 64
that 0 323 64
must 0 323 64
be 0 323 64
addressed 0 323 64
is 0 323 64
the 1 323 64
license 1 323 64
for 1 323 64
sin 1 323 64
to 1 323 64
have 1 323 64
a 1 323 64
home 1 323 64
in 1 323 64
individuals 1 323 64
at 1 323 64
every 1 323 64
level 1 323 64
of 1 323 64
the 1 323 64
Church. 1 323 64

There 0 323 65
is 0 323 65
a 0 323 65
certain 0 323 65
comfort 0 323 65
level 0 323 65
with 0 323 65
sin 0 323 65
that 0 323 65
has 0 323 65
come 0 323 65
to 0 323 65
pervade 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
teaching, 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
preaching, 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
decision 0 323 65
making, 0 323 65
and 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
very 0 323 65
way 0 323 65
of 0 323 65
living. 0 323 65

If 0 323 66
you’ll 0 323 66
permit 0 323 66
me, 0 323 66
what 1 323 66
the 1 323 66
Church 1 323 66
needs 1 323 66
now 1 323 66
is 1 323 66
more 1 323 66
hatred! 1 323 66

As 0 323 67
I 0 323 67
have 0 323 67
said 0 323 67
previously, 0 323 67
St. 0 323 67
Thomas 0 323 67
Aquinas 0 323 67
said 0 323 67
that 0 323 67
hatred 0 323 67
of 0 323 67
wickedness 0 323 67
actually 0 323 67
belongs 0 323 67
to 0 323 67
the 0 323 67
virtue 0 323 67
of 0 323 67
charity. 0 323 67

As 0 323 68
the 0 323 68
Book 0 323 68
of 0 323 68
Proverbs 0 323 68
says 0 323 68
“My 0 323 68
mouth 0 323 68
shall 0 323 68
meditate 0 323 68
truth, 0 323 68
and 0 323 68
my 0 323 68
lips 0 323 68
shall 0 323 68
hate 0 323 68
wickedness 0 323 68
(Prov. 0 323 68

8:7).” 0 323 69
It 1 323 69
is 1 323 69
an 1 323 69
act 1 323 69
of 1 323 69
love 1 323 69
to 1 323 69
hate 1 323 69
sin 1 323 69
and 1 323 69
to 1 323 69
call 1 323 69
others 1 323 69
to 1 323 69
turn 1 323 69
away 1 323 69
from 1 323 69
sin. 1 323 69

There 0 323 70
must 0 323 70
be 0 323 70
no 0 323 70
room 0 323 70
left, 0 323 70
no 0 323 70
refuge 0 323 70
for 0 323 70
sin 0 323 70
— 0 323 70
either 0 323 70
within 0 323 70
our 0 323 70
own 0 323 70
lives, 0 323 70
or 0 323 70
within 0 323 70
the 0 323 70
lives 0 323 70
of 0 323 70
our 0 323 70
communities. 0 323 70

To 0 323 71
be 0 323 71
a 0 323 71
refuge 0 323 71
for 0 323 71
sinners 0 323 71
(which 0 323 71
we 0 323 71
should 0 323 71
be), 0 323 71
the 0 323 71
Church 0 323 71
must 0 323 71
be 0 323 71
a 0 323 71
place 0 323 71
where 0 323 71
sinners 0 323 71
can 0 323 71
turn 0 323 71
to 0 323 71
be 0 323 71
reconciled. 0 323 71

In 0 323 72
this 0 323 72
I 0 323 72
speak 0 323 72
of 0 323 72
all 0 323 72
sin. 0 323 72

But 0 323 73
to 0 323 73
be 0 323 73
clear, 0 323 73
in 0 323 73
the 0 323 73
specific 0 323 73
situations 0 323 73
at 0 323 73
hand, 0 323 73
we 0 323 73
are 0 323 73
talking 0 323 73
about 0 323 73
deviant 1 323 73
sexual 1 323 73
— 0 323 73
almost 0 323 73
exclusively 0 323 73
homosexual 0 323 73
— 0 323 73
acts 0 323 73
by 0 323 73
clerics. 0 323 73

We’re 0 323 74
also 0 323 74
talking 0 323 74
about 0 323 74
homosexual 0 323 74
propositions 0 323 74
and 0 323 74
abuses 0 323 74
against 0 323 74
seminarians 0 323 74
and 0 323 74
young 0 323 74
priests 0 323 74
by 0 323 74
powerful 1 323 74
priests, 1 323 74
bishops, 1 323 74
and 1 323 74
cardinals. 1 323 74

We 0 323 75
are 0 323 75
talking 0 323 75
about 0 323 75
acts 0 323 75
and 0 323 75
actions 0 323 75
which 0 323 75
are 0 323 75
not 0 323 75
only 0 323 75
in 0 323 75
violation 0 323 75
of 0 323 75
the 0 323 75
sacred 0 323 75
promises 0 323 75
made 0 323 75
by 0 323 75
some, 0 323 75
in 0 323 75
short, 0 323 75
sacrilege, 0 323 75
but 1 323 75
also 1 323 75
are 1 323 75
in 1 323 75
violation 1 323 75
of 1 323 75
the 1 323 75
natural 1 323 75
moral 1 323 75
law 1 323 75
for 1 323 75
all. 1 323 75

To 0 323 76
call 0 323 76
it 0 323 76
anything 0 323 76
else 0 323 76
would 0 323 76
be 0 323 76
deceitful 0 323 76
and 0 323 76
would 0 323 76
only 0 323 76
ignore 0 323 76
the 0 323 76
problem 0 323 76
further. 0 323 76

There 0 323 77
has 0 323 77
been 0 323 77
a 0 323 77
great 0 323 77
deal 0 323 77
of 0 323 77
effort 0 323 77
to 0 323 77
keep 0 323 77
separate 0 323 77
acts 0 323 77
which 0 323 77
fall 0 323 77
under 0 323 77
the 0 323 77
category 0 323 77
of 0 323 77
now-culturally-acceptable 1 323 77
acts 1 323 77
of 1 323 77
homosexuality 1 323 77
from 0 323 77
the 0 323 77
publically-deplorable 1 323 77
acts 1 323 77
of 1 323 77
pedophilia. 1 323 77

That 0 323 78
is 0 323 78
to 0 323 78
say, 0 323 78
until 0 323 78
recently 0 323 78
the 0 323 78
problems 0 323 78
of 0 323 78
the 0 323 78
Church 0 323 78
have 0 323 78
been 0 323 78
painted 0 323 78
purely 0 323 78
as 0 323 78
problems 0 323 78
of 0 323 78
pedophilia 0 323 78
— 0 323 78
this 0 323 78
despite 0 323 78
clear 0 323 78
evidence 0 323 78
to 0 323 78
the 0 323 78
contrary. 0 323 78

It 0 323 79
is 0 323 79
time 0 323 79
to 0 323 79
be 0 323 79
honest 0 323 79
that 0 323 79
the 0 323 79
problems 0 323 79
are 0 323 79
both 0 323 79
and 0 323 79
they 0 323 79
are 0 323 79
more. 0 323 79

To 0 323 80
fall 0 323 80
into 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
trap 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
parsing 0 323 80
problems 0 323 80
according 0 323 80
to 0 323 80
what 0 323 80
society 0 323 80
might 0 323 80
find 0 323 80
acceptable 0 323 80
or 0 323 80
unacceptable 0 323 80
is 0 323 80
ignoring 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
fact 0 323 80
that 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
Church 0 323 80
has 0 323 80
never 0 323 80
held 0 323 80
ANY 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
it 0 323 80
to 0 323 80
be 0 323 80
acceptable 0 323 80
— 0 323 80
neither 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
abuse 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
children, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
any 0 323 80
use 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
one’s 0 323 80
sexuality 0 323 80
outside 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
marital 0 323 80
relationship, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
sin 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
sodomy, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
entering 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
clerics 0 323 80
into 0 323 80
intimate 0 323 80
sexual 0 323 80
relationships 0 323 80
at 0 323 80
all, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
abuse 0 323 80
and 0 323 80
coercion 0 323 80
by 0 323 80
those 0 323 80
with 0 323 80
authority. 0 323 80

In 0 323 81
this 0 323 81
last 0 323 81
regard, 0 323 81
special 0 323 81
mention 0 323 81
should 0 323 81
be 0 323 81
made 0 323 81
of 0 323 81
the 1 323 81
most 1 323 81
notorious 1 323 81
and 1 323 81
highest 1 323 81
in 1 323 81
ranking 1 323 81
case, 1 323 81
that 0 323 81
being 0 323 81
the 0 323 81
allegations 0 323 81
of 0 323 81
former-Cardinal 0 323 81
Theodore 0 323 81
McCarrick’s 0 323 81
(oft-rumored, 0 323 81
now 0 323 81
very 0 323 81
public) 0 323 81
sexual 0 323 81
sins, 0 323 81
predation, 0 323 81
and 0 323 81
abuse 0 323 81
of 0 323 81
power. 0 323 81

The 0 323 82
well-documented 0 323 82
details 0 323 82
of 0 323 82
this 0 323 82
case 0 323 82
are 0 323 82
disgraceful 1 323 82
and 0 323 82
seriously 1 323 82
scandalous, 1 323 82
as 0 323 82
is 0 323 82
any 0 323 82
covering 0 323 82
up 0 323 82
of 0 323 82
such 0 323 82
appalling 1 323 82
actions 1 323 82
by 0 323 82
other 0 323 82
Church 0 323 82
leaders 0 323 82
who 0 323 82
knew 0 323 82
about 0 323 82
it 0 323 82
based 0 323 82
on 0 323 82
solid 0 323 82
evidence. 0 323 82

While 0 323 83
recent 0 323 83
credible 0 323 83
accusations 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
child 0 323 83
sexual 0 323 83
abuse 0 323 83
by 0 323 83
Archbishop 0 323 83
McCarrick 0 323 83
have 0 323 83
brought 0 323 83
a 1 323 83
whole 1 323 83
slew 1 323 83
of 1 323 83
issues 1 323 83
to 0 323 83
light, 0 323 83
long-ignored 0 323 83
was 0 323 83
the 0 323 83
issue 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
abuse 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
his 0 323 83
power 0 323 83
for 0 323 83
the 0 323 83
sake 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
homosexual 0 323 83
gratification. 0 323 83

It 0 323 84
is 0 323 84
time 0 323 84
to 0 323 84
admit 0 323 84
that 0 323 84
there 0 323 84
is 0 323 84
a 0 323 84
homosexual 0 323 84
subculture 0 323 84
within 0 323 84
the 0 323 84
hierarchy 0 323 84
of 0 323 84
the 0 323 84
Catholic 0 323 84
Church 0 323 84
that 0 323 84
is 0 323 84
wreaking 1 323 84
great 1 323 84
devastation 1 323 84
in 1 323 84
the 1 323 84
vineyard 1 323 84
of 1 323 84
the 1 323 84
Lord. 1 323 84

The 0 323 85
Church’s 0 323 85
teaching 0 323 85
is 0 323 85
clear 0 323 85
that 0 323 85
the 0 323 85
homosexual 0 323 85
inclination 0 323 85
is 0 323 85
not 0 323 85
in 0 323 85
itself 0 323 85
sinful, 0 323 85
but 0 323 85
it 0 323 85
is 0 323 85
intrinsically 0 323 85
disordered 0 323 85
in 0 323 85
a 0 323 85
way 0 323 85
that 0 323 85
renders 0 323 85
any 0 323 85
man 0 323 85
stably 0 323 85
afflicted 0 323 85
by 0 323 85
it 0 323 85
unfit 0 323 85
to 0 323 85
be 0 323 85
a 0 323 85
priest. 0 323 85

And 0 323 86
the 0 323 86
decision 0 323 86
to 0 323 86
act 0 323 86
upon 0 323 86
this 0 323 86
disordered 0 323 86
inclination 0 323 86
is 0 323 86
a 1 323 86
sin 1 323 86
so 1 323 86
grave 1 323 86
that 1 323 86
it 1 323 86
cries 1 323 86
out 1 323 86
to 1 323 86
heaven 1 323 86
for 1 323 86
vengeance, 1 323 86
especially 0 323 86
when 0 323 86
it 0 323 86
involves 0 323 86
preying 0 323 86
upon 0 323 86
the 0 323 86
young 0 323 86
or 0 323 86
the 0 323 86
vulnerable. 0 323 86

Such 0 323 87
wickedness 1 323 87
should 0 323 87
be 0 323 87
hated 1 323 87
with 1 323 87
a 1 323 87
perfect 1 323 87
hatred. 1 323 87

Christian 0 323 88
charity 0 323 88
itself 0 323 88
demands 0 323 88
that 0 323 88
we 0 323 88
should 0 323 88
hate 0 323 88
wickedness 0 323 88
just 0 323 88
as 0 323 88
we 0 323 88
love 0 323 88
goodness. 0 323 88

But 0 323 89
while 0 323 89
hating 0 323 89
the 0 323 89
sin, 0 323 89
we 0 323 89
must 0 323 89
never 0 323 89
hate 0 323 89
the 0 323 89
sinner, 0 323 89
who 0 323 89
is 0 323 89
called 0 323 89
to 0 323 89
conversion, 0 323 89
penance, 0 323 89
and 0 323 89
renewed 0 323 89
communion 0 323 89
with 0 323 89
Christ 0 323 89
and 0 323 89
His 0 323 89
Church, 0 323 89
through 0 323 89
His 0 323 89
inexhaustible 0 323 89
mercy. 0 323 89

At 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
same 0 323 90
time, 0 323 90
however, 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
love 0 323 90
and 0 323 90
mercy 0 323 90
which 0 323 90
we 0 323 90
are 0 323 90
called 0 323 90
to 0 323 90
have 0 323 90
even 0 323 90
for 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
worst 0 323 90
of 0 323 90
sinners 0 323 90
does 0 323 90
not 0 323 90
exclude 0 323 90
holding 0 323 90
them 0 323 90
accountable 0 323 90
for 0 323 90
their 0 323 90
actions 0 323 90
through 0 323 90
a 0 323 90
punishment 0 323 90
proportionate 0 323 90
to 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
gravity 0 323 90
of 0 323 90
their 0 323 90
offense. 0 323 90

In 0 323 91
fact, 0 323 91
a 0 323 91
just 0 323 91
punishment 0 323 91
is 0 323 91
an 0 323 91
important 0 323 91
work 0 323 91
of 0 323 91
love 0 323 91
and 0 323 91
mercy, 0 323 91
because, 0 323 91
while 0 323 91
it 0 323 91
serves 0 323 91
primarily 0 323 91
as 0 323 91
retribution 0 323 91
for 0 323 91
the 0 323 91
offense 0 323 91
committed, 0 323 91
it 1 323 91
also 1 323 91
offers 1 323 91
the 1 323 91
guilty 1 323 91
party 1 323 91
an 1 323 91
opportunity 1 323 91
to 1 323 91
make 1 323 91
expiation 1 323 91
for 1 323 91
his 1 323 91
sin 1 323 91
in 1 323 91
this 1 323 91
life 1 323 91
(if 1 323 91
he 1 323 91
willingly 1 323 91
accepts 1 323 91
his 1 323 91
punishment), 1 323 91
thus 1 323 91
sparing 1 323 91
him 1 323 91
worse 1 323 91
punishment 1 323 91
in 1 323 91
the 1 323 91
life 1 323 91
to 1 323 91
come. 1 323 91

Motivated, 0 323 92
therefore, 0 323 92
by 0 323 92
love 0 323 92
and 0 323 92
concern 0 323 92
for 0 323 92
souls, 0 323 92
I 0 323 92
stand 0 323 92
with 0 323 92
those 0 323 92
calling 0 323 92
for 0 323 92
justice 0 323 92
to 0 323 92
be 0 323 92
done 0 323 92
upon 0 323 92
the 0 323 92
guilty. 0 323 92

The 0 323 93
sins 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
crimes 0 323 93
of 0 323 93
McCarrick, 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
of 0 323 93
far 0 323 93
too 0 323 93
many 0 323 93
others 0 323 93
in 0 323 93
the 0 323 93
Church, 0 323 93
bring 0 323 93
suspicion 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
mistrust 0 323 93
upon 0 323 93
many 1 323 93
good 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
virtuous 1 323 93
priests, 1 323 93
bishops, 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
cardinals, 1 323 93
and 0 323 93
suspicion 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
mistrust 0 323 93
upon 0 323 93
many 1 323 93
great 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
respectable 1 323 93
seminaries 1 323 93
and 0 323 93
so 1 323 93
many 1 323 93
holy 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
faithful 1 323 93
seminarians. 1 323 93

The 0 323 94
result 0 323 94
of 0 323 94
the 0 323 94
first 0 323 94
instance 0 323 94
of 0 323 94
mistrust 0 323 94
harms 0 323 94
the 0 323 94
Church 0 323 94
and 0 323 94
the 0 323 94
very 0 323 94
good 0 323 94
work 0 323 94
we 0 323 94
do 0 323 94
in 0 323 94
Christ’s 0 323 94
name. 0 323 94

It 0 323 95
causes 0 323 95
others 0 323 95
to 0 323 95
sin 0 323 95
in 0 323 95
their 0 323 95
thoughts, 0 323 95
words, 0 323 95
and 0 323 95
deeds 0 323 95
— 0 323 95
which 0 323 95
is 0 323 95
the 0 323 95
very 0 323 95
definition 0 323 95
of 0 323 95
scandal. 0 323 95

And 0 323 96
the 0 323 96
second 0 323 96
mistrust 0 323 96
harms 0 323 96
the 0 323 96
future 0 323 96
of 0 323 96
the 0 323 96
Church, 0 323 96
since 0 323 96
our 0 323 96
future 0 323 96
priests 0 323 96
are 0 323 96
at 0 323 96
stake. 0 323 96

I 0 323 97
said 0 323 97
that 0 323 97
I 0 323 97
was 0 323 97
tempted 0 323 97
to 0 323 97
despair 0 323 97
in 0 323 97
light 0 323 97
of 0 323 97
all 0 323 97
of 0 323 97
this. 0 323 97

However, 0 323 98
that 0 323 98
temptation 0 323 98
quickly 0 323 98
passed, 0 323 98
thanks 0 323 98
be 0 323 98
to 0 323 98
God. 0 323 98

No 0 323 99
matter 0 323 99
how 0 323 99
large 0 323 99
the 0 323 99
problem, 0 323 99
we 0 323 99
know 0 323 99
that 0 323 99
we 0 323 99
are 0 323 99
called 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
go 0 323 99
forward 0 323 99
in 0 323 99
faith, 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
rely 0 323 99
upon 0 323 99
God’s 0 323 99
promises 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
us, 0 323 99
and 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
work 0 323 99
hard 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
make 0 323 99
every 0 323 99
bit 0 323 99
of 0 323 99
difference 0 323 99
we 0 323 99
can, 0 323 99
within 0 323 99
our 0 323 99
spheres 0 323 99
of 0 323 99
influence. 0 323 99

I 0 323 100
have 0 323 100
recently 0 323 100
had 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
opportunity 0 323 100
to 0 323 100
talk 0 323 100
directly 0 323 100
with 0 323 100
our 0 323 100
seminarians 0 323 100
about 0 323 100
these 0 323 100
very 0 323 100
pressing 0 323 100
matters, 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
I 0 323 100
have 0 323 100
begun 0 323 100
to, 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
will 0 323 100
continue 0 323 100
to, 0 323 100
talk 0 323 100
with 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
priests 0 323 100
of 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
diocese, 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
well 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
faithful, 0 323 100
in 0 323 100
person 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
through 0 323 100
my 0 323 100
weekly 0 323 100
column 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
homilies, 0 323 100
making 0 323 100
things 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
clear 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
I 0 323 100
can, 0 323 100
from 0 323 100
my 0 323 100
perspective. 0 323 100

Here 0 323 101
now, 0 323 101
I 0 323 101
offer 0 323 101
a 0 323 101
few 0 323 101
thoughts 0 323 101
to 0 323 101
those 0 323 101
of 0 323 101
my 0 323 101
diocese: 0 323 101

In 0 323 102
the 0 323 102
first 0 323 102
place, 0 323 102
we 0 323 102
must 0 323 102
continue 0 323 102
to 0 323 102
build 0 323 102
upon 0 323 102
the 0 323 102
good 0 323 102
work 0 323 102
which 0 323 102
we 0 323 102
have 0 323 102
accomplished 0 323 102
in 0 323 102
protecting 0 323 102
the 0 323 102
youth 0 323 102
and 0 323 102
vulnerable 0 323 102
of 0 323 102
our 0 323 102
diocese. 0 323 102

This 0 323 103
is 0 323 103
a 0 323 103
work 0 323 103
on 0 323 103
which 0 323 103
we 0 323 103
can 0 323 103
never 0 323 103
rest 0 323 103
in 0 323 103
our 0 323 103
vigilance, 0 323 103
nor 0 323 103
our 0 323 103
efforts 0 323 103
to 0 323 103
improve. 0 323 103

We 0 323 104
must 0 323 104
continue 0 323 104
in 0 323 104
our 0 323 104
work 0 323 104
of 0 323 104
education 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
all 0 323 104
and 0 323 104
hold 0 323 104
to 0 323 104
the 0 323 104
effective 0 323 104
policies 0 323 104
that 0 323 104
have 0 323 104
been 0 323 104
implemented, 0 323 104
requiring 0 323 104
psychological 0 323 104
exams 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
all 0 323 104
candidates 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
ministry, 0 323 104
as 0 323 104
well 0 323 104
as 0 323 104
across-the-board 0 323 104
background 0 323 104
checks 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
anyone 0 323 104
working 0 323 104
with 0 323 104
children 0 323 104
or 0 323 104
vulnerable 0 323 104
individuals. 0 323 104

Here 0 323 105
again, 0 323 105
I 0 323 105
state, 0 323 105
as 0 323 105
we 0 323 105
have 0 323 105
done 0 323 105
consistently, 0 323 105
if 0 323 105
you 0 323 105
have 0 323 105
knowledge 0 323 105
of 0 323 105
any 0 323 105
sort 0 323 105
of 0 323 105
criminal 0 323 105
abuse 0 323 105
of 0 323 105
children 0 323 105
by 0 323 105
someone 0 323 105
in 0 323 105
the 0 323 105
Church, 0 323 105
contact 0 323 105
law 0 323 105
enforcement. 0 323 105

If 0 323 106
you 0 323 106
need 0 323 106
help 0 323 106
in 0 323 106
contacting 0 323 106

Assistance 0 323 106
Coordinator 0 323 106
and 0 323 106
she 0 323 106

with 0 323 106
the 0 323 106
best 0 323 106
resources. 0 323 106

If 0 323 107
you 0 323 107
are 0 323 107
an 0 323 107
adult 0 323 107
victim 0 323 107
of 0 323 107
sexual 0 323 107
abuse 0 323 107
from 0 323 107
childhood, 0 323 107
we 0 323 107
still 0 323 107
encourage 0 323 107
you 0 323 107
to 0 323 107

out 0 323 107
to 0 323 107
law 0 323 107
enforcement 0 323 107
first, 0 323 107
but 0 323 107
even 0 323 107
if 0 323 107
you 0 323 107
don’t 0 323 107
want 0 323 107
to, 0 323 107
please 0 323 107
still 0 323 107
reach 0 323 107
out 0 323 107
to 0 323 107
us. 0 323 107

To 0 323 108
our 0 323 108
seminarians: 0 323 108
If 0 323 108
you 0 323 108
are 0 323 108
unchastely 0 323 108
propositioned, 0 323 108
abused, 0 323 108
or 0 323 108
threatened 0 323 108
(no 0 323 108
matter 0 323 108
by 0 323 108
whom), 0 323 108
or 0 323 108
if 0 323 108
you 0 323 108
directly 0 323 108
witness 0 323 108
unchaste 0 323 108
behavior, 0 323 108
report 0 323 108
it 0 323 108
to 0 323 108
me 0 323 108
and 0 323 108
to 0 323 108
the 0 323 108
seminary 0 323 108
rector. 0 323 108

I 0 323 109
will 0 323 109
address 0 323 109
it 0 323 109
swiftly 1 323 109
and 1 323 109
vigorously. 1 323 109

I 1 323 110
will 1 323 110
not 1 323 110
stand 1 323 110
for 1 323 110
this 1 323 110
in 0 323 110
my 0 323 110
diocese 0 323 110
or 0 323 110
anywhere 0 323 110
I 0 323 110
send 0 323 110
men 0 323 110
for 0 323 110
formation. 0 323 110

I 0 323 111
trust 0 323 111
that 0 323 111
the 0 323 111
seminaries 0 323 111
I 0 323 111
choose, 0 323 111
very 0 323 111
discriminately, 0 323 111
to 0 323 111
help 0 323 111
form 0 323 111
our 0 323 111
men 0 323 111
will 0 323 111
not 0 323 111
ignore 0 323 111
this 0 323 111
type 0 323 111
of 0 323 111
scandalous 1 323 111
behavior, 0 323 111
and 0 323 111
I 0 323 111
will 0 323 111
continue 0 323 111
to 0 323 111
verify 0 323 111
that 0 323 111
expectation. 0 323 111

To 0 323 112
our 0 323 112
priests: 0 323 112

In 0 323 116

and 1 323 116
a 1 323 116
pure 1 323 116
and 1 323 116
happy 1 323 116
priest 1 323 116
— 0 323 116
as 0 323 116
Christ 0 323 116
Himself 0 323 116
is 0 323 116
calling 0 323 116
you 0 323 116
to 0 323 116

And 0 323 117
by 0 323 117

live 0 323 117

and 0 323 117
celibate 0 323 117
life 0 323 117
so 0 323 117
that 0 323 117
you 0 323 117
can 0 323 117
completely 0 323 117
give 0 323 117
your 0 323 117

to 0 323 117
Christ, 0 323 117
the 0 323 117
Church, 0 323 117

the 0 323 117

God 0 323 118
will 0 323 118
give 0 323 118
you 0 323 118
the 0 323 118
graces 0 323 118
to 0 323 118
do 0 323 118
so. 0 323 118

Ask 0 323 119
Him 0 323 119
for 0 323 119
the 0 323 119
help 0 323 119
you 0 323 119
need 0 323 119
daily 0 323 119
and 0 323 119
throughout 0 323 119
every 0 323 119
day. 0 323 119

And 0 323 120
if 0 323 120
you 0 323 120
are 0 323 120
unchastely 0 323 120
propositioned, 0 323 120
abused, 0 323 120
or 0 323 120
threatened 0 323 120
(no 0 323 120
matter 0 323 120
by 0 323 120
whom), 0 323 120
or 0 323 120
if 0 323 120
you 0 323 120
directly 0 323 120
witness 0 323 120
unchaste 0 323 120
behavior, 0 323 120
report 0 323 120
it 0 323 120
to 0 323 120
me. 0 323 120

I 1 323 121
will 1 323 121
not 1 323 121
stand 1 323 121
for 1 323 121
this 1 323 121
in 0 323 121
my 0 323 121
diocese 0 323 121
any 0 323 121
more 0 323 121
than 0 323 121
in 0 323 121
our 0 323 121
seminaries. 0 323 121

To 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
faithful 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
diocese: 0 323 122
If 0 323 122
you 0 323 122
are 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
victim 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
abuse 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
any 0 323 122
kind 0 323 122
by 0 323 122
a 0 323 122
priest, 0 323 122
bishop, 0 323 122
cardinal, 0 323 122
or 0 323 122
any 0 323 122
employee 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
Church, 0 323 122
bring 0 323 122
it 0 323 122
forward. 0 323 122

It 0 323 123
will 0 323 123
be 0 323 123
addressed 0 323 123
quickly 0 323 123
and 0 323 123
justly. 0 323 123

If 0 323 124
you 0 323 124
have 0 323 124
directly 0 323 124
witnessed 0 323 124
sexual 0 323 124
advances 0 323 124
or 0 323 124
any 0 323 124
type 0 323 124
of 0 323 124
abuse, 0 323 124
bring 0 323 124
it 0 323 124
forward 0 323 124
as 0 323 124
well. 0 323 124

Such 0 323 125
actions 0 323 125
are 0 323 125
sinful 1 323 125
and 1 323 125
scandalous 1 323 125
and 0 323 125
we 0 323 125
cannot 0 323 125
allow 0 323 125
anyone 0 323 125
to 0 323 125
use 0 323 125
their 0 323 125
position 0 323 125
or 0 323 125
power 0 323 125
to 0 323 125
abuse 0 323 125
another 0 323 125
person. 0 323 125

Again, 0 323 126
in 0 323 126
addition 0 323 126
to 0 323 126
injuring 0 323 126
individuals, 0 323 126
these 0 323 126
actions 0 323 126
injure 1 323 126
the 1 323 126
very 1 323 126
Body 1 323 126
of 1 323 126
Christ, 1 323 126
His 1 323 126
Church. 1 323 126

Furthermore, 0 323 127
I 0 323 127
add 0 323 127
my 0 323 127
name 0 323 127
to 0 323 127
those 0 323 127
calling 0 323 127

real 0 323 127
and 0 323 127
sustained 0 323 127

in 0 323 127
the 0 323 127
episcopate, 0 323 127

schools, 0 323 127
universities, 0 323 127
and 0 323 127
seminaries 0 323 127
that 0 323 127
would 0 323 127
root 0 323 127
out 0 323 127
and 0 323 127
hold 0 323 127
accountable 0 323 127
any 0 323 127
would-be 0 323 127
sexual 0 323 127
predator 0 323 127
or 0 323 127
accomplice; 0 323 127

I 0 323 128
will 0 323 128
hold 0 323 128
the 0 323 128

to 0 323 128
you 0 323 128
and 0 323 128
your 0 323 128

and 0 323 128
evidence 0 323 128
of 0 323 128
failure 0 323 128
in 0 323 128
this 0 323 128
regard 0 323 128
will 0 323 128
be 0 323 128
justly 0 323 128
addressed; 0 323 128

I 0 323 129
will 0 323 129
likewise 0 323 129
hold 0 323 129
every 0 323 129
man 0 323 129
studying 0 323 129
for 0 323 129
the 0 323 129
priesthood 0 323 129
for 0 323 129
our 0 323 129
diocese 0 323 129
accountable 0 323 129
to 0 323 129
living 0 323 129

of 0 323 129
his 0 323 129
formation 0 323 129
for 0 323 129
the 0 323 129
priesthood. 0 323 129

Failure 1 323 130
to 1 323 130
do 1 323 130
so 1 323 130
will 1 323 130
lead 1 323 130
to 1 323 130
dismissal 1 323 130
from 1 323 130
diocesan 1 323 130
sponsorship; 1 323 130

I 0 323 131
will 0 323 131
continue 0 323 131
to 0 323 131
require 0 323 131

protected 0 323 131
from 0 323 131

I 0 323 133
promise 0 323 133
to 0 323 133

I 0 323 134

Pray 1 323 135

Pray 1 323 136

of 1 323 140
the 1 323 140
Triumph 1 323 140
of 1 323 140
the 1 323 140
Holy 1 323 140
Cross, 1 323 140
at 1 323 140
Holy 1 323 140
Name 1 323 140
Heights 1 323 140
and 1 323 140
I 1 323 140
ask 1 323 140
all 1 323 140
pastors 1 323 140
to 1 323 140
do 1 323 140
the 1 323 140
same 1 323 140
in 1 323 140
their 1 323 140
own 1 323 140
parishes. 1 323 140

In 0 323 141
addition, 0 323 141
I 0 323 141
ask 0 323 141
that 0 323 141
all 0 323 141
priests, 0 323 141
clergy, 0 323 141
religious, 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
diocesan 0 323 141
employees 0 323 141
join 0 323 141
me 0 323 141
in 0 323 141
observing 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
upcoming 0 323 141
Autumn 0 323 141
Ember 0 323 141
Days 0 323 141
(Sep. 0 323 141
19, 0 323 141
21, 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
22) 0 323 141
as 0 323 141
days 0 323 141
of 0 323 141
fasting 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
abstinence 0 323 141
in 0 323 141
reparation 0 323 141
for 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
sins 1 323 141
and 1 323 141
outrages 1 323 141
committed 0 323 141
by 0 323 141
members 0 323 141
of 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
clergy 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
episcopacy 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
I 0 323 141
invite 0 323 141
all 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
faithful 0 323 141
to 0 323 141
do 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
same. 0 323 141

Some 0 323 142
sins, 0 323 142
like 0 323 142
some 0 323 142
demons, 0 323 142
can 0 323 142
only 0 323 142
be 0 323 142
driven 0 323 142
out 0 323 142
by 0 323 142
prayer 0 323 142
and 0 323 142
fasting. 0 323 142

This 0 323 143
letter 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
these 0 323 143
statements 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
promises 0 323 143
are 0 323 143
not 0 323 143
intended 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
be 0 323 143
an 0 323 143
exhaustive 0 323 143
list 0 323 143
of 0 323 143
what 0 323 143
we 0 323 143
can 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
need 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
do 0 323 143
in 0 323 143
the 0 323 143
Church 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
begin 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
heal 0 323 143
from, 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
stave 1 323 143
off, 1 323 143
this 1 323 143
deep 1 323 143
illness 1 323 143
in 1 323 143
the 1 323 143
Church, 1 323 143
but 0 323 143
rather 0 323 143
the 0 323 143
next 0 323 143
steps 0 323 143
I 0 323 143
believe 0 323 143
we 0 323 143
can 0 323 143
take 0 323 143
locally. 0 323 143

More 0 323 144
than 0 323 144
anything 0 323 144
else, 0 323 144
we 0 323 144
as 0 323 144
a 0 323 144
Church 0 323 144
must 0 323 144
cease 0 323 144
our 0 323 144
acceptance 0 323 144
of 0 323 144
sin 0 323 144
and 0 323 144
evil. 0 323 144

We 0 323 145
must 0 323 145
cast 1 323 145
out 1 323 145
sin 1 323 145
from 1 323 145
our 1 323 145
own 1 323 145
lives 1 323 145
and 1 323 145
run 1 323 145
toward 1 323 145
holiness. 1 323 145

We 0 323 146
must 0 323 146
refuse 0 323 146
to 0 323 146
be 0 323 146
silent 0 323 146
in 0 323 146
the 0 323 146
face 0 323 146
of 0 323 146
sin 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
evil 0 323 146
in 0 323 146
our 0 323 146
families 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
communities 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
we 0 323 146
must 0 323 146
demand 0 323 146
from 0 323 146
our 0 323 146
pastors 0 323 146
— 0 323 146
myself 0 323 146
included 0 323 146
— 0 323 146
that 0 323 146
they 0 323 146
themselves 0 323 146
are 0 323 146
striving 0 323 146
day 0 323 146
in 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
day 0 323 146
out 0 323 146
for 0 323 146
holiness. 0 323 146

We 0 323 147
must 0 323 147
do 0 323 147
this 0 323 147
always 0 323 147
with 0 323 147
loving 0 323 147
respect 0 323 147
for 0 323 147
individuals 0 323 147
but 0 323 147
with 0 323 147
a 0 323 147
clear 0 323 147
understanding 0 323 147
that 0 323 147
true 0 323 147
love 0 323 147
can 0 323 147
never 0 323 147
exist 0 323 147
without 0 323 147
truth. 0 323 147

Again, 0 323 148
right 0 323 148
now 0 323 148
there 0 323 148
is 0 323 148
a 0 323 148
lot 0 323 148
of 0 323 148
justified 0 323 148
anger 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
passion 0 323 148
coming 0 323 148
from 0 323 148
many 0 323 148
holy 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
faithful 0 323 148
lay 0 323 148
people 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
clerics 0 323 148
across 0 323 148
the 0 323 148
country, 0 323 148
calling 0 323 148
for 0 323 148
real 0 323 148
reform 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
“house 0 323 148
cleaning” 0 323 148
of 0 323 148
this 0 323 148
type 0 323 148
of 0 323 148
depravity. 0 323 148

I 0 323 149
stand 0 323 149
with 0 323 149
them. 0 323 149

I 0 323 150
don’t 0 323 150
know 0 323 150
yet 0 323 150
how 0 323 150
this 0 323 150
will 0 323 150
play 0 323 150
out 0 323 150
nationally 0 323 150
or 0 323 150
internationally. 0 323 150

But 0 323 151
I 0 323 151
do 0 323 151
know 0 323 151
this, 0 323 151
and 0 323 151
I 0 323 151
make 0 323 151
this 0 323 151
my 0 323 151
last 0 323 151
point 0 323 151
and 0 323 151
last 0 323 151
promise, 0 323 151
for 0 323 151
the 0 323 151
Diocese 0 323 151
of 0 323 151
Madison: 0 323 151
“As 0 323 151
for 0 323 151
me 0 323 151
and 0 323 151
my 0 323 151
household, 0 323 151
we 1 323 151
will 1 323 151
serve 1 323 151
the 1 323 151
Lord.” 1 323 151

Faithfully 0 323 152
yours 0 323 152
in 0 323 152
the 0 323 152
Lord, 0 323 152

Most 0 323 153
Rev. 0 323 153

Robert 0 323 154
C. 0 323 154

This 0 323 155

text 0 323 155

first 0 323 155

appeared 0 323 155

in 0 323 155

the 0 323 155

Madison 0 323 155

Catholic 0 323 155

Herald. 0 323 155

Cardinal 0 330 0
Theodore 0 330 0
McCarrick: 0 330 0
Yet 0 330 0
Another 0 330 0
Fruit 0 330 0
of 0 330 0
Vatican 0 330 0
II 0 330 0

Still, 0 330 1
we’re 0 330 1
also 0 330 1
averse 0 330 1
to 0 330 1
speaking 0 330 1
in 0 330 1
terms 0 330 1
of 0 330 1
good 0 330 1
and 0 330 1
evil. 0 330 1

Right 0 330 2
and 0 330 2
wrong? 0 330 2

Maybe. 0 330 3

But 0 330 4
good 0 330 4
and 0 330 4
evil 0 330 4
have 0 330 4
a 0 330 4
supernatural 0 330 4
ring 0 330 4
we 0 330 4
usually 0 330 4
reserve 0 330 4
for 0 330 4
dramatic 0 330 4
and 0 330 4
abominable 1 330 4
crimes, 0 330 4
like 0 330 4
genocide. 1 330 4

Yet 1 330 5
everything 1 330 5
right 1 330 5
is 1 330 5
good, 1 330 5
and 1 330 5
everything 1 330 5
wrong 1 330 5
is 1 330 5
evil. 1 330 5

The 0 330 6
evils 0 330 6
we 0 330 6
encounter 0 330 6
in 0 330 6
our 0 330 6
day-to-day 0 330 6
lives 0 330 6
might 0 330 6
not 0 330 6
be 0 330 6
a 0 330 6
spectacle, 0 330 6
like 0 330 6
jihadists 0 330 6
beheading 0 330 6
a 0 330 6
journalist 0 330 6
on 0 330 6
live 0 330 6
television. 0 330 6

All 0 330 7
the 0 330 7
same, 0 330 7
evil 0 330 7
is 0 330 7
part 0 330 7
of 0 330 7
ordinary 0 330 7
life. 0 330 7

It 0 330 8
dwells 0 330 8
deep 0 330 8
in 0 330 8
our 0 330 8
hearts 0 330 8
– 0 330 8
each 0 330 8
and 0 330 8
every 0 330 8
one 0 330 8
of 0 330 8
us. 0 330 8

The 0 330 9
Prince 1 330 9
of 1 330 9
this 1 330 9
World 1 330 9
has 0 330 9
made 0 330 9
a 0 330 9
grand 0 330 9
display 0 330 9
of 0 330 9
his 0 330 9
authority 0 330 9
in 0 330 9
the 0 330 9
last 0 330 9
few 0 330 9
centuries. 0 330 9

Our 0 330 10
saving 0 330 10
grace 0 330 10
is 0 330 10
that, 0 330 10
while 0 330 10
Westerners 0 330 10
no 0 330 10
longer 0 330 10
believe 0 330 10
in 0 330 10
God, 0 330 10
they 0 330 10
still 0 330 10
believe 0 330 10
in 0 330 10
the 0 330 10
Devil. 0 330 10

We’re 0 330 11
at 0 330 11
least 0 330 11
clear-eyed 0 330 11
enough 0 330 11
to 0 330 11
recognize 0 330 11
true 0 330 11
evil 0 330 11
at 0 330 11
work 0 330 11
in 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
world, 0 330 11
even 0 330 11
if 0 330 11
we 0 330 11
can 0 330 11
no 0 330 11
longer 0 330 11
see 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
great 0 330 11
Good 0 330 11
hidden 0 330 11
behind 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
veil. 0 330 11

This 0 330 12
is 0 330 12
the 0 330 12
point 0 330 12
about 0 330 12
the 0 330 12
McCarrick 0 330 12
scandal 0 330 12
that 0 330 12
even 0 330 12
religious 0 330 12
commentators 0 330 12
tend 0 330 12
to 0 330 12
overlook. 0 330 12

How 0 330 13
was 0 330 13
he 0 330 13
allowed 0 330 13
to 0 330 13
go 0 330 13
on 0 330 13
molesting 0 330 13
young 0 330 13
priests 0 330 13
and 0 330 13
seminarians 0 330 13
when 0 330 13
virtually 0 330 13
the 0 330 13
entire 0 330 13
Church 0 330 13
hierarchy 0 330 13
knew 0 330 13
what 0 330 13
he 0 330 13
was 0 330 13
up 0 330 13
to? 0 330 13

And 0 330 14
how 0 330 14
was 0 330 14
such 0 330 14
a 0 330 14
depraved 1 330 14
individual 0 330 14
ordained 0 330 14
in 0 330 14
the 0 330 14
first 0 330 14
place, 0 330 14
let 0 330 14
alone 0 330 14
promoted 0 330 14
to 0 330 14
Cardinal-Archbishop 0 330 14
of 0 330 14
Washington? 0 330 14

The 0 330 15
answer 0 330 15
is, 0 330 15
ultimately, 0 330 15
demonic. 1 330 15

As 0 330 16
Catholics, 0 330 16
we 0 330 16
ask 0 330 16
St. 0 330 16
Michael 0 330 16
to 0 330 16
“cast 0 330 16
into 0 330 16
Hell 0 330 16
Satan 0 330 16
and 0 330 16
all 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
evil 0 330 16
spirits 0 330 16
who 0 330 16
prowl 0 330 16
about 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
world 0 330 16
seeking 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
ruin 0 330 16
of 0 330 16
souls.” 0 330 16
McCarrick 0 330 16
and 0 330 16
his 0 330 16
fellow 0 330 16
perverts 1 330 16
in 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
clergy 0 330 16
are 0 330 16
responsible, 0 330 16
not 0 330 16
only 0 330 16
for 0 330 16
their 0 330 16
sexual 0 330 16
abuses, 0 330 16
but 0 330 16
also 0 330 16
for 0 330 16
chasing 0 330 16
good 0 330 16
men 0 330 16
away 0 330 16
from 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
priesthood. 0 330 16

Spend 0 330 17
enough 0 330 17
time 0 330 17
in 0 330 17
Catholic 0 330 17
World 0 330 17
and 0 330 17
you 0 330 17
inevitably 0 330 17
meet 0 330 17
good 0 330 17
men 0 330 17
who 0 330 17
quit 0 330 17
the 0 330 17
seminary 0 330 17
because 0 330 17
of 0 330 17
some 0 330 17
rampant 1 330 17
(and 0 330 17
often 0 330 17
violent) 0 330 17
depravity. 0 330 17

What 0 330 18
could 0 330 18
suit 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
Devil 0 330 18
more 0 330 18
than 0 330 18
to 0 330 18
watch 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
Church 0 330 18
burn 0 330 18
her 0 330 18
wheat 0 330 18
as 0 330 18
she 0 330 18
gathers 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
chaff? 0 330 18

The 0 330 19
gates 0 330 19
of 0 330 19
Hell 0 330 19
will 0 330 19
not 0 330 19
prevail 0 330 19
against 0 330 19
the 0 330 19
Church, 0 330 19
as 0 330 19
Our 0 330 19
Lord 0 330 19
promised. 0 330 19

But 0 330 20
they 0 330 20
won’t 0 330 20
stop 0 330 20
trying, 0 330 20
either. 0 330 20

They’ve 0 330 21
attacked 0 330 21
from 0 330 21
the 0 330 21
front, 0 330 21
sending 0 330 21
the 0 330 21
Roman 0 330 21
pagans, 0 330 21
French 0 330 21
Revolutionaries, 0 330 21
and 0 330 21
British 0 330 21
American 0 330 21
secularists. 0 330 21

They 0 330 22
flank 0 330 22
us 0 330 22
by 0 330 22
sending 0 330 22
heretics 0 330 22
like 0 330 22
Arius, 0 330 22
Luther, 0 330 22
and 0 330 22
Hans 0 330 22
Kung. 0 330 22

Today, 0 330 23
there’s 0 330 23
also 0 330 23
a 0 330 23
fifth 0 330 23
column 0 330 23
working 0 330 23
to 0 330 23
tear 0 330 23
down 0 330 23
the 0 330 23
walls 0 330 23
from 0 330 23
within 0 330 23
– 0 330 23
not 0 330 23
only 0 330 23
pedophiles 0 330 23
like 0 330 23
John 0 330 23
Geoghan, 0 330 23
but 0 330 23
also 0 330 23
predators 1 330 23
like 0 330 23
Theodore 0 330 23
McCarrick. 0 330 23

Where 0 330 24
did 0 330 24
those 0 330 24
fifth 0 330 24
columnists 0 330 24
enter? 0 330 24

Why, 0 330 25
there’s 1 330 25
only 1 330 25
one 1 330 25
possible 1 330 25
explanation: 1 330 25
the 0 330 25
Second 0 330 25
Vatican 0 330 25
Council. 0 330 25

Aggiornamento 0 330 26
sounds 0 330 26
like 0 330 26
a 0 330 26
Lefebvrist 0 330 26
slur. 0 330 26

The 0 330 27
idea 0 330 27
that 0 330 27
an 0 330 27
ecumenical 0 330 27
council 0 330 27
of 0 330 27
the 0 330 27
Catholic 0 330 27
Church 0 330 27
would 0 330 27
openly 0 330 27
seek 0 330 27
to 0 330 27
“bring 0 330 27
itself 0 330 27
up 0 330 27
to 0 330 27
date” 0 330 27
is 0 330 27
ridiculous. 0 330 27

Yet 0 330 28
that 0 330 28
was 0 330 28
precisely 0 330 28
the 0 330 28
aim. 0 330 28

As 0 330 29
St 0 330 29
Pope 0 330 29
John 0 330 29
XXIII 0 330 29
explained, 0 330 29
“Its 0 330 29
principal 0 330 29
task 0 330 29
will 0 330 29
be 0 330 29
concerned 0 330 29
with 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
conditions 0 330 29
and 0 330 29
modernization 0 330 29
of 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
Church 0 330 29
after 0 330 29
20 0 330 29
centuries 0 330 29
of 0 330 29
life.” 0 330 29
It 0 330 29
was 0 330 29
not 0 330 29
supposed 0 330 29
(as 0 330 29
some 0 330 29
have 0 330 29
claimed) 0 330 29
to 0 330 29
simply 0 330 29
update 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
liturgy 0 330 29
from 0 330 29
its 0 330 29
last 0 330 29
redesign 0 330 29
in 0 330 29
1570. 0 330 29

The 0 330 30
goal 0 330 30
was 0 330 30
to 0 330 30
align 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Church 0 330 30
more 0 330 30
with 0 330 30
modern 0 330 30
world: 0 330 30
a 0 330 30
world 0 330 30
defined, 0 330 30
to 0 330 30
a 0 330 30
considerable 0 330 30
extent, 0 330 30
by 0 330 30
its 0 330 30
rejection 0 330 30
of 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Catholic 0 330 30
world 0 330 30
that 0 330 30
flourished 0 330 30
before 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Protestant 0 330 30
Reformation 0 330 30
and 0 330 30
French 0 330 30
Revolution. 0 330 30

Now, 0 330 31
I 0 330 31
don’t 0 330 31
believe 0 330 31
Pope 0 330 31
John 0 330 31
saw 0 330 31
himself 0 330 31
as 0 330 31
endangering 0 330 31
either 0 330 31
orthodoxy 0 330 31
or 0 330 31
sacred, 0 330 31
immutable 0 330 31
tradition. 0 330 31

I 0 330 32
share 0 330 32
Pope 0 330 32
Paul 0 330 32
IV’s 0 330 32
view. 0 330 32

When 0 330 33
he 0 330 33
heard 0 330 33
that 0 330 33
the 0 330 33
Council 0 330 33
was 0 330 33
being 0 330 33
convened, 0 330 33
then-Cardinal 0 330 33
Montini 0 330 33
is 0 330 33
supposed 0 330 33
to 0 330 33
have 0 330 33
sighed, 0 330 33
“This 0 330 33
holy 1 330 33
old 1 330 33
boy 1 330 33
doesn’t 0 330 33
realise 0 330 33
what 0 330 33
a 0 330 33
hornet’s 0 330 33
nest 0 330 33
he’s 0 330 33
stirring 0 330 33
up.” 0 330 33

Nonetheless, 0 330 34
he 0 330 34
stirred 0 330 34
it. 0 330 34

The 0 330 35
spirit 0 330 35
of 0 330 35
aggiornamento 0 330 35
quickly 0 330 35
spread 0 330 35
through 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
Church 0 330 35
in 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
1960s 0 330 35
– 0 330 35
and 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
seminaries 0 330 35
especially. 0 330 35

Seminarians 0 330 36
called 0 330 36
for 0 330 36
a 0 330 36
more 0 330 36
“participatory” 0 330 36
administration. 0 330 36

They 0 330 37
became 0 330 37
involved 0 330 37
in 0 330 37
socialist 0 330 37
politics. 0 330 37

They 0 330 38
formed 0 330 38
trade 0 330 38
unions 0 330 38
to 0 330 38
demand 0 330 38
the 0 330 38
right 0 330 38
to 0 330 38
marry. 0 330 38

They 0 330 39
practiced 0 330 39
sauvage 0 330 39
intercommunion. 0 330 39

Of 0 330 40
course, 0 330 40
they 0 330 40
had 0 330 40
their 0 330 40
enablers 0 330 40
in 0 330 40
the 0 330 40
hierarchy 0 330 40
as 0 330 40
well. 0 330 40

Perhaps 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
worst 0 330 41
was 0 330 41
Archbishop 0 330 41
Marty 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
Paris, 0 330 41
a 0 330 41
leader 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
“priest-worker 0 330 41
movement” 0 330 41
who 0 330 41
defended 0 330 41
Marxist 0 330 41
and 0 330 41
existentialist 0 330 41
atheisms 0 330 41
on 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
floor 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
Council. 0 330 41

During 0 330 42
a 0 330 42
homily 0 330 42
at 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
Cathedral, 0 330 42
he 0 330 42
also 0 330 42
praised 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
soixantehuitards: 0 330 42
“the 0 330 42
great 0 330 42
outburst 0 330 42
of 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
younger 0 330 42
generation 0 330 42
that 0 330 42
suddenly 0 330 42
wanted 0 330 42
to 0 330 42
take 0 330 42
its 0 330 42
place 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
life” 0 330 42
that 0 330 42
occurred 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
his 0 330 42
city 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
May 0 330 42
of 0 330 42
1968. 0 330 42

“One 0 330 43
also 0 330 43
felt 0 330 43
that, 0 330 43
in 0 330 43
these 0 330 43
events 0 330 43
of 0 330 43
May,” 0 330 43
Marty 0 330 43
continued, 0 330 43
“the 0 330 43
seriousness 0 330 43
of 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
working 0 330 43
class, 0 330 43
which 0 330 43
wants 0 330 43
not 0 330 43
only 0 330 43
to 0 330 43
earn 0 330 43
a 0 330 43
living 0 330 43
wage, 0 330 43
but 0 330 43
also 0 330 43
to 0 330 43
find 0 330 43
its 0 330 43
freedom, 0 330 43
its 0 330 43
independence.” 0 330 43
Theaggiornamentistas 0 330 43
was 0 330 43
never 0 330 43
purged 0 330 43
from 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
Church, 0 330 43
and 0 330 43
certainly 0 330 43
not 0 330 43
from 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
seminaries. 0 330 43

As 0 330 44
the 0 330 44
modern 0 330 44
world 0 330 44
continued 0 330 44
to 0 330 44
reject 0 330 44
traditional 0 330 44
Christian 0 330 44
mores, 0 330 44
so 0 330 44
too 0 330 44
does 0 330 44
the 0 330 44
Church 0 330 44
seem 0 330 44
increasingly 0 330 44
“out 0 330 44
of 0 330 44
step” 0 330 44
and 0 330 44
in 0 330 44
need 0 330 44
of 0 330 44
“modernizing”. 0 330 44

Inevitably, 0 330 45
this 0 330 45
came 0 330 45
to 0 330 45
mean 0 330 45
the 0 330 45
acceptance 0 330 45
of 0 330 45
homosexuality. 0 330 45

Bishop 0 330 46
Wilton 0 330 46
D. 0 330 46
Gregory, 0 330 46
as 0 330 46
president 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
the 0 330 46
U.S. 0 330 46
Conference 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
Catholic 0 330 46
Bishops, 0 330 46
infamously 0 330 46
spoke 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
“an 0 330 46
ongoing 0 330 46
struggle 0 330 46
to 0 330 46
make 0 330 46
sure 0 330 46
that 0 330 46
the 0 330 46
Catholic 0 330 46
priesthood 0 330 46
is 0 330 46
not 0 330 46
dominated 0 330 46
by 0 330 46
homosexual 0 330 46
men.” 0 330 46

But 0 330 47
that 0 330 47
predominance 0 330 47
has 0 330 47
very 0 330 47
little 0 330 47
to 0 330 47
do 0 330 47
with 0 330 47
homosexuality 0 330 47
per 0 330 47
se. 0 330 47

Rather, 0 330 48
the 0 330 48
1960s 0 330 48
rejection 0 330 48
of 0 330 48
celibacy 0 330 48
in 0 330 48
the 0 330 48
seminaries 0 330 48
naturally 0 330 48
provided 0 330 48
more 0 330 48
(shall 0 330 48
we 0 330 48
say) 0 330 48
opportunities 0 330 48
for 0 330 48
gay 0 330 48
men 0 330 48
– 0 330 48
given 0 330 48
that 0 330 48
there 0 330 48
are, 0 330 48
of 0 330 48
course, 0 330 48
no 0 330 48
women 0 330 48
in 0 330 48
Catholic 0 330 48
seminaries. 0 330 48

This 0 330 49
began 0 330 49
driving 0 330 49
away 0 330 49
heterosexuals, 0 330 49
as 0 330 49
well 0 330 49
as 0 330 49
homosexuals 0 330 49
who 0 330 49
upheld 0 330 49
the 0 330 49
Church’s 0 330 49
teachings 0 330 49
on 0 330 49
chastity 0 330 49
and 0 330 49
celibacy. 0 330 49

Needless 0 330 50
to 0 330 50
say, 0 330 50
not 0 330 50
all 0 330 50
gay 0 330 50
priests 0 330 50
are 0 330 50
violent 1 330 50
predators 1 330 50
like 0 330 50
McCarrick. 0 330 50

But 0 330 51
the 0 330 51
toleration 0 330 51
of 0 330 51
sexually 0 330 51
active 0 330 51
priests 0 330 51
gave 0 330 51
McCarrick 0 330 51
cover 0 330 51
to 0 330 51
“seduce” 0 330 51
his 0 330 51
victims. 0 330 51

Many 0 330 52
have 0 330 52
also 0 330 52
speculated 0 330 52
that, 0 330 52
because 0 330 52
McCarrick’s 0 330 52
victims 0 330 52
were 0 330 52
overwhelmingly 0 330 52
above 0 330 52
the 0 330 52
age 0 330 52
of 0 330 52
consent, 0 330 52
the 0 330 52
media 0 330 52
didn’t 0 330 52
consider 0 330 52
them 0 330 52
newsworthy. 0 330 52

If 0 330 53
he’d 0 330 53
fondled 0 330 53
a 0 330 53
12-year 0 330 53
old 0 330 53
altar 0 330 53
boy, 0 330 53
that 0 330 53
would 0 330 53
have 0 330 53
been 0 330 53
one 0 330 53
thing. 0 330 53

Pedophile 1 330 54
priests 1 330 54
sell 1 330 54
papers. 1 330 54

But 0 330 55
taking 0 330 55
an 0 330 55
18-year-old 0 330 55
seminarian 0 330 55
to 0 330 55
bed? 0 330 55

Running 0 330 56
that 0 330 56
story 0 330 56
would 0 330 56
simply 0 330 56
be 0 330 56
outing 0 330 56
a 0 330 56
closeted 1 330 56
gay 1 330 56
man: 1 330 56
an 0 330 56
act 0 330 56
the 0 330 56
liberal 0 330 56
press 0 330 56
would 0 330 56
no 0 330 56
doubt 0 330 56
consider 0 330 56
“homophobic”, 0 330 56
as 0 330 56
Ross 0 330 56
Douthat 0 330 56
pointed 0 330 56
out. 0 330 56

Meanwhile, 0 330 57
those 0 330 57

who 0 330 57
didn’t 0 330 57
approve 0 330 57

his 0 330 57
actions 0 330 57
knew 0 330 57
the 0 330 57
culture 0 330 57
– 0 330 57
both 0 330 57
within 0 330 57
the 0 330 57
Church 0 330 57
and 0 330 57
without 0 330 57
her 0 330 57
– 0 330 57
were 0 330 57
against 0 330 57
them. 0 330 57

The 0 330 58
post-Vatican 0 330 58
Church 0 330 58
doesn’t 0 330 58
like 0 330 58
to 0 330 58
come 0 330 58
off 0 330 58
as 0 330 58
a 0 330 58
nag. 0 330 58

She’s 0 330 59
not 0 330 59
going 0 330 59
to 0 330 59
cause 0 330 59
a 0 330 59
fuss 0 330 59
by 0 330 59
purging 0 330 59
sexually 0 330 59
active 0 330 59
gay 0 330 59
men 0 330 59
from 0 330 59
the 0 330 59
clergy 0 330 59
just 0 330 59
because… 0 330 59
what? 0 330 59

It’s 0 330 60
immoral? 0 330 60

That’s 0 330 61
not 0 330 61
very 0 330 61
aggiornamentistic! 0 330 61

The 0 330 62
world 0 330 62
and 0 330 62
our 0 330 62
worldly 0 330 62
bishops 0 330 62
were, 0 330 62
unsurprisingly, 0 330 62
of 0 330 62
one 0 330 62
mind. 0 330 62

And 0 330 63
even 0 330 63
if 0 330 63
they 0 330 63
were 0 330 63
disgusted 0 330 63
by 0 330 63
McCarrick, 0 330 63
these 0 330 63
prelates 0 330 63
weren’t 0 330 63
willing 0 330 63
to 0 330 63
jeopardize 0 330 63
their 0 330 63
careers 0 330 63
by 0 330 63
standing 0 330 63
for 0 330 63
justice 0 330 63
against 0 330 63
vice. 0 330 63

We 0 330 64
seem 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
be 0 330 64
slouching 0 330 64
back 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
old 0 330 64
traditionalist 0 330 64
trope: 0 330 64
All 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
Church’s 0 330 64
problems 0 330 64
would 0 330 64
be 0 330 64
solved 0 330 64
if 0 330 64
we’d 0 330 64
just 0 330 64
go 0 330 64
back 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
Latin 0 330 64
Mass. 0 330 64

Something 0 330 65
went 0 330 65
critically 1 330 65
wrong 1 330 65
during 0 330 65
Vatican 0 330 65
II 0 330 65
that 0 330 65
extends 0 330 65
well 0 330 65
beyond 0 330 65
the 0 330 65
Mass. 0 330 65

And 0 330 66
we 0 330 66
can’t 0 330 66
drag 0 330 66
the 0 330 66
Church 0 330 66
out 0 330 66
of 0 330 66
her 0 330 66
present 0 330 66
crisis 0 330 66
until 0 330 66
we 0 330 66
have 0 330 66
the 0 330 66
courage 0 330 66
to 0 330 66
brave 0 330 66
accusations 0 330 66
of 0 330 66
“Lefebvrism” 0 330 66
and 0 330 66
say 0 330 66
so. 0 330 66

Those 0 330 67
who 0 330 67
love 0 330 67
our 0 330 67
Holy 0 330 67
Mother 0 330 67
– 0 330 67
those 0 330 67
who 0 330 67
want 0 330 67
to 0 330 67
protect 0 330 67
her 0 330 67
boys 0 330 67
and 0 330 67
men 0 330 67
from 0 330 67
all 0 330 67
the 0 330 67
McCarricks 0 330 67
and 0 330 67
their 0 330 67
perverse 1 330 67
appetites 0 330 67
– 0 330 67
mustn’t 0 330 67
be 0 330 67
deceived 0 330 67
into 0 330 67
thinking 0 330 67
this 0 330 67
is 0 330 67
a 0 330 67
small 0 330 67
or 0 330 67
an 0 330 67
isolated 0 330 67
issue. 0 330 67

It 0 330 68
isn’t. 0 330 68

This 0 330 69
is 0 330 69
the 0 330 69
crisis 0 330 69
of 0 330 69
an 0 330 69
ancient 0 330 69
and 0 330 69
immortal 0 330 69
institution 0 330 69
trying 0 330 69
desperately 0 330 69
to 0 330 69
seem 0 330 69
young 0 330 69
and 0 330 69
fashionable; 0 330 69
like 0 330 69
all 0 330 69
old 0 330 69
men, 0 330 69
it 0 330 69
only 0 330 69
manages 0 330 69
to 0 330 69
come 0 330 69
across 0 330 69
as 0 330 69
lecherous 1 330 69
and 1 330 69
pathetic. 1 330 69

Its 0 330 70
obsession 0 330 70
with 0 330 70
“modernization” 0 330 70
leads 0 330 70
it 0 330 70
to 0 330 70
only 0 330 70
adopt 0 330 70
the 0 330 70
vices 0 330 70
of 0 330 70
modernity. 0 330 70

Instead 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
serving 0 330 71
as 0 330 71
ambassadors 0 330 71
from 0 330 71
the 0 330 71
City 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
God, 0 330 71
far 0 330 71
too 0 330 71
many 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
our 0 330 71
priests 0 330 71
and 0 330 71
prelates 0 330 71
have 0 330 71
become 0 330 71
agents 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
the 0 330 71
City 0 330 71

Man. 0 330 71

I 0 330 72

will 0 330 72

I 1 330 73
don’t 1 330 73

in 0 335 3

of 0 335 3
this 0 335 3
astonishing 1 335 3
and 1 335 3
indeed 1 335 3
providential 1 335 3
development. 1 335 3

Regarding 0 335 4
Bergoglio, 0 335 4
Viganò 0 335 4
testifies 0 335 4
that 0 335 4
in 0 335 4
2013 0 335 4
he 0 335 4
personally 0 335 4
informed 0 335 4
him 0 335 4
about 0 335 4
McCarrick’s 0 335 4
history, 0 335 4
the 0 335 4
dossier 0 335 4
of 0 335 4
the 0 335 4
Congregation 0 335 4
for 0 335 4
Bishops 0 335 4
on 0 335 4
his 0 335 4
sexual 0 335 4
crimes 0 335 4
against 0 335 4
boys 0 335 4
and 0 335 4
young 0 335 4
men, 0 335 4
and 0 335 4
the 0 335 4
disciplinary 0 335 4
sanctions 0 335 4
imposed 0 335 4
upon 0 335 4
him 0 335 4
by 0 335 4
Benedict 0 335 4
XVI 0 335 4
(forbidding 0 335 4
residence 0 335 4
in 0 335 4
a 0 335 4
seminary, 0 335 4
public 0 335 4
appearances 0 335 4
and 0 335 4
Masses). 0 335 4

Evidently 0 335 5
already 0 335 5
aware 0 335 5
of 0 335 5
these 0 335 5
facts, 0 335 5
however, 0 335 5
Bergoglio 0 335 5
not 0 335 5
only 0 335 5
rehabilitated 0 335 5
McCarrick 0 335 5
but 0 335 5
made 0 335 5
him 0 335 5
a 0 335 5
“trusted 0 335 5
counselor” 0 335 5
who 0 335 5
advised 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
elevation 0 335 5
of 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
pro-homosexual 0 335 5
prelates 0 335 5
Blase 0 335 5
Cupich, 0 335 5
Joseph 0 335 5
Tobin 0 335 5
and 0 335 5
Kevin 0 335 5

to 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
College 0 335 5
of 0 335 5
Cardinals 0 335 5
and 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
prominent 0 335 5
episcopal 0 335 5
sees 0 335 5
they 0 335 5
now 0 335 5
discredit. 0 335 5

All 0 335 6
of 0 335 6
this 0 335 6
happened 0 335 6
before 0 335 6
Bergoglio, 0 335 6
bowing 0 335 6
to 0 335 6
worldwide 0 335 6
public 0 335 6
pressure, 0 335 6
finally—only 0 335 6
weeks 0 335 6
ago—took 0 335 6
decisive 0 335 6
action 0 335 6
against 0 335 6
his 0 335 6
“trusted 1 335 6
counselor.” 1 335 6
McCarrick 0 335 6
had 0 335 6
lobbied 0 335 6
for 0 335 6
Bergoglio’s 0 335 6
election, 0 335 6
along 0 335 6
with 0 335 6
Maradiaga 0 335 6
and 0 335 6
the 1 335 6
infamous 1 335 6
Cardinal 1 335 6
Danneels, 0 335 6
who 1 335 6
covered 1 335 6
up 1 335 6
homosexual 1 335 6
rape 1 335 6
committed 1 335 6
by 1 335 6
a 1 335 6
priest 1 335 6
against 1 335 6
his 1 335 6
own 1 335 6
nephew,has 1 335 6
supported 1 335 6
“same-sex 1 335 6
marriage,” 1 335 6
and 1 335 6
advised 1 335 6
the 1 335 6
King 1 335 6
of 1 335 6
Belgium 1 335 6
to 1 335 6
sign 1 335 6
a 1 335 6
law 1 335 6
legalizing 1 335 6
abortion 1 335 6
in 1 335 6
1990. 1 335 6

As 1 335 7
Edward 1 335 7
Pentin 1 335 7
notes: 1 335 7
“all 1 335 7
3 1 335 7
prelates 1 335 7
have 1 335 7
since 1 335 7
been 1 335 7
special 1 335 7
advisors 1 335 7
of 1 335 7
Francis 1 335 7
or 1 335 7
rehabilitated 1 335 7
by 1 335 7
him.” 1 335 7

Viganò 0 335 8
concludes 0 335 8
his 0 335 8
testimony 0 335 8
by 0 335 8
declaring 0 335 8
that 0 335 8
all 0 335 8
of 0 335 8
the 0 335 8
prelates 0 335 8
involved 0 335 8
(many 0 335 8
others 0 335 8
are 0 335 8
implicated), 0 335 8
including 0 335 8
Bergoglio, 0 335 8
should 0 335 8
resign 0 335 8
their 0 335 8
offices 0 335 8
for 0 335 8
the 0 335 8
good 0 335 8
of 0 335 8
the 0 335 8
Church. 0 335 8

As 0 335 9
to 0 335 9
Bergoglio 0 335 9
in 0 335 9
particular, 0 335 9
he 0 335 9
courageously 0 335 9
states 0 335 9
openly 0 335 9
the 0 335 9
truth 0 335 9
that 0 335 9
so 0 335 9
many 0 335 9
of 0 335 9
his 0 335 9
brethren 0 335 9
know 0 335 9
but 0 335 9
fear 0 335 9
to 0 335 9
speak 0 335 9
in 0 335 9
public: 0 335 9

I 0 335 10
want 0 335 10
to 0 335 10
recall 0 335 10
this 1 335 10
indefectible 1 335 10
truth 1 335 10
of 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
Church’s 0 335 10
holiness 0 335 10
to 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
many 0 335 10
people 0 335 10
who 0 335 10
have 0 335 10
been 0 335 10
so 0 335 10
deeply 1 335 10
scandalized 1 335 10
by 1 335 10
the 1 335 10
abominable 1 335 10
and 1 335 10
sacrilegious 1 335 10
behavior 1 335 10
of 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
former 0 335 10
Archbishop 0 335 10
of 0 335 10
Washington, 0 335 10
Theodore 0 335 10
McCarrick; 0 335 10
by 0 335 10
the 1 335 10
grave, 1 335 10
disconcerting 1 335 10
and 1 335 10
sinful 1 335 10
conduct 1 335 10
of 0 335 10
Pope 0 335 10
Francis 0 335 10
and 0 335 10
by 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
conspiracy 0 335 10
of 0 335 10
silence 0 335 10
of 0 335 10
so 0 335 10
many 0 335 10
pastors, 0 335 10
and 0 335 10
who 0 335 10
are 0 335 10
tempted 0 335 10
to 0 335 10
abandon 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
Church, 0 335 10
disfigured 1 335 10
by 1 335 10
so 1 335 10
many 1 335 10
ignominies. 1 335 10

At 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
Angelus 0 335 11
on 0 335 11
Sunday, 0 335 11
August 0 335 11
12, 0 335 11
2018 0 335 11
Pope 0 335 11
Francis 0 335 11
said 0 335 11
these 0 335 11
words: 0 335 11
“Everyone 1 335 11
is 1 335 11
guilty 1 335 11
for 1 335 11
the 1 335 11
good 1 335 11
he 1 335 11
could 1 335 11
have 1 335 11
done 1 335 11
and 1 335 11
did 1 335 11
not 1 335 11
do 1 335 11
... 1 335 11

If 1 335 12
we 1 335 12
do 1 335 12
not 1 335 12
oppose 1 335 12
evil, 1 335 12
we 1 335 12
tacitly 1 335 12
feed 1 335 12
it. 1 335 12

We 0 335 13
need 0 335 13
to 0 335 13
intervene 0 335 13
where 0 335 13
evil 0 335 13
is 0 335 13
spreading; 0 335 13
for 0 335 13
evil 0 335 13
spreads 0 335 13
where 0 335 13
daring 0 335 13
Christians 0 335 13
who 0 335 13
oppose 0 335 13
evil 0 335 13
with 0 335 13
good 0 335 13
are 0 335 13
lacking.” 0 335 13
[emphasis 0 335 13
in 0 335 13
original] 0 335 13
If 0 335 13
this 0 335 13
is 0 335 13
rightly 0 335 13
to 0 335 13
be 0 335 13
considered 0 335 13
a 0 335 13
serious 0 335 13
moral 0 335 13
responsibility 0 335 13
for 0 335 13
every 0 335 13
believer, 0 335 13
how 0 335 13
much 0 335 13
graver 0 335 13
is 0 335 13
it 0 335 13
for 0 335 13
the 1 335 13
Church’s 1 335 13
supreme 1 335 13
pastor, 1 335 13
who 1 335 13
in 1 335 13
the 1 335 13
case 1 335 13
of 1 335 13
McCarrick 1 335 13
not 1 335 13
only 1 335 13
did 1 335 13
not 1 335 13
oppose 1 335 13
evil 1 335 13
but 1 335 13
associated 1 335 13
himself 1 335 13
in 1 335 13
doing 1 335 13
evil 1 335 13
with 1 335 13
someone 1 335 13
he 1 335 13
knew 1 335 13
to 1 335 13
be 1 335 13
deeply 1 335 13
corrupt. 1 335 13

He 0 335 14
followed 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
advice 0 335 14
of 0 335 14
someone 1 335 14
he 1 335 14
knew 1 335 14
well 1 335 14
to 1 335 14
be 1 335 14
a 1 335 14
pervert, 1 335 14
thus 0 335 14
multiplying 0 335 14
exponentially 0 335 14
with 0 335 14
his 0 335 14
supreme 0 335 14
authority 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
evil 0 335 14
done 0 335 14
by 0 335 14
McCarrick. 0 335 14

And 0 335 15
how 0 335 15
many 0 335 15
other 0 335 15
evil 1 335 15
pastors 1 335 15
is 0 335 15
Francis 0 335 15
still 0 335 15
continuing 0 335 15
to 0 335 15
prop 0 335 15
up 0 335 15
in 0 335 15
their 1 335 15
active 1 335 15
destruction 1 335 15
of 1 335 15
the 1 335 15
Church! 1 335 15

[my 0 335 16
emphasis] 0 335 16
Francis 0 335 16
is 0 335 16
abdicating 0 335 16
the 0 335 16
mandate 0 335 16
which 0 335 16
Christ 0 335 16
gave 0 335 16
to 0 335 16
Peter 0 335 16
to 0 335 16
confirm 0 335 16
the 0 335 16
brethren. 0 335 16

Indeed, 0 335 17
by 0 335 17
his 0 335 17
action 0 335 17
he 0 335 17
has 0 335 17
divided 0 335 17
them, 0 335 17
led 0 335 17
them 0 335 17
into 0 335 17
error, 0 335 17
and 0 335 17
encouraged 1 335 17
the 1 335 17
wolves 1 335 17
to 1 335 17
continue 1 335 17
to 1 335 17
tear 1 335 17
apart 1 335 17
the 1 335 17
sheep 1 335 17
of 0 335 17
Christ’s 0 335 17
flock. 0 335 17

In 0 335 18
this 0 335 18
extremely 1 335 18
dramatic 1 335 18
moment 1 335 18
for 0 335 18
the 0 335 18
universal 0 335 18
Church, 0 335 18
he 0 335 18
must 0 335 18
acknowledge 0 335 18
his 0 335 18
mistakes 0 335 18
and, 0 335 18
in 0 335 18
keeping 0 335 18
with 0 335 18
the 0 335 18
proclaimed 0 335 18
principle 0 335 18
of 0 335 18
zero 0 335 18
tolerance, 0 335 18
Pope 0 335 18
Francis 0 335 18
must 0 335 18
be 0 335 18
the 0 335 18
first 0 335 18
to 0 335 18
set 0 335 18
a 0 335 18
good 0 335 18
example 0 335 18
for 0 335 18
cardinals 0 335 18

who 0 335 18
covered 0 335 18
up 0 335 18

testimony. 0 335 21

With 0 335 22
Viganò’s 0 335 22
testimony, 0 335 22
the 0 335 22
widespread 0 335 22
homosexual 0 335 22
infiltration 0 335 22
of 0 335 22
the 0 335 22
post-Vatican 0 335 22

hierarchy, 0 335 22
from 0 335 22
the 0 335 22
top 0 335 22
on 0 335 22
down, 0 335 22
now 0 335 22
emerges 1 335 22
mountainously 1 335 22

never 1 335 22
to 1 335 22

buried 1 335 22
again. 1 335 22

Even 0 335 23
before 0 335 23
that 0 335 23
testimony, 0 335 23
however, 0 335 23
the 0 335 23
fall 0 335 23
of 0 335 23
McCarrick 0 335 23
and 0 335 23
the 0 335 23
Pennsylvania 0 335 23
grand 0 335 23
jury 0 335 23
report 0 335 23
had 0 335 23
already 0 335 23
presented 0 335 23
a 1 335 23
Sisyphean 1 335 23
task 1 335 23
to 0 335 23
neo-Catholic 1 335 23
apologists 1 335 23
for 0 335 23
the 0 335 23
decrepit 0 335 23
Novus 0 335 23
Ordo 0 335 23
status 0 335 23
quo 0 335 23
and 0 335 23
the 0 335 23
ill-starred 0 335 23
Council 0 335 23
that 0 335 23
launched 0 335 23
its 0 335 23

Yet 1 335 24
there 1 335 24
is 1 335 24
little 1 335 24
doubt 1 335 24
they 1 335 24
will 1 335 24
continue 1 335 24
the 1 335 24
same 1 335 24
polemic 1 335 24
that 1 335 24
for 1 335 24
nearly 1 335 24
sixty 1 335 24
years 1 335 24
has 1 335 24
doggedly 1 335 24
defended 1 335 24
every 1 335 24
one 1 335 24
of 1 335 24
the 1 335 24
ruinous 1 335 24
“reforms” 1 335 24
that 1 335 24
have 1 335 24
resulted 1 335 24
in 1 335 24
a 1 335 24
debacle 1 335 24
without 1 335 24
equal 1 335 24
in 1 335 24
Church 1 335 24
history, 1 335 24
even 0 335 24
considering 0 335 24
the 0 335 24
Arian 0 335 24
crisis 0 335 24
of 0 335 24
the 0 335 24
4th 0 335 24
century. 0 335 24

Those 0 335 25
“reforms” 0 335 25
included 0 335 25
abandonment 0 335 25
of 0 335 25
the 0 335 25
Vatican’s 0 335 25
strict 0 335 25
pre-conciliar 0 335 25
instruction 0 335 25
(1961) 0 335 25
that 0 335 25
“advancement 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
religious 1 335 25
vows 1 335 25
and 1 335 25

should 1 335 25
be 1 335 25
barred 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
those 1 335 25
who 1 335 25
are 1 335 25
afflicted 1 335 25
with 1 335 25
evil 1 335 25
tendencies 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
homosexuality 1 335 25
or 1 335 25
pederasty, 1 335 25
since 1 335 25
for 1 335 25
them 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
common 1 335 25
life 1 335 25
and 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
priestly 1 335 25
ministry 1 335 25
would 1 335 25
constitute 1 335 25
serious 1 335 25
dangers.” 1 335 25
Today, 1 335 25
neo-Catholic 1 335 25
commentators, 1 335 25
cowed 1 335 25
by 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
demands 1 335 25
of 1 335 25
political 1 335 25
correctness, 1 335 25
refuse 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
state 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
simple 1 335 25
truth 1 335 25
that 1 335 25
homosexuality 1 335 25
is 1 335 25
a 1 335 25
perversion 1 335 25
that 1 335 25
precludes 1 335 25
ordination 1 335 25

does 1 335 25
any 1 335 25

grave 1 335 25
psychological 1 335 25
disorder. 1 335 25

to 0 335 33
impeach 0 335 33
Viganò’s 0 335 33
testimony 0 335 33
is, 0 335 33
as 0 335 33
one 0 335 33
would 0 335 33
expect 0 335 33
from 0 335 33
him, 0 335 33
a 0 335 33
bit 0 335 33
craftier. 0 335 33

His 0 335 34
opinion 0 335 34
is: 0 335 34
“Take 1 335 34
it 1 335 34
seriously, 1 335 34

Which 1 335 34
is 1 335 34
just 1 335 34

more 1 335 34

about 0 335 62
it, 0 335 62
but 0 335 62
I 0 335 62
would 0 335 62
like 0 335 62
your 0 335 62
professional 0 335 62
maturity 0 335 62
to 0 335 62
do 0 335 62
this 0 335 62
work. 0 335 62

It 0 335 63
will 0 335 63
do 0 335 63
you 0 335 63
all 0 335 63
good, 0 335 63
really. 0 335 63

In 0 335 64
other 0 335 64
words, 0 335 64
as 1 335 64
Bergoglio 1 335 64
cannot 1 335 64
deny 1 335 64
the 1 335 64
allegations 1 335 64
without 1 335 64
lying, 1 335 64
he 1 335 64
will 1 335 64
say 1 335 64
nothing 1 335 64
at 1 335 64
all 1 335 64
about 1 335 64
them 1 335 64
in 1 335 64
the 1 335 64
hope 1 335 64
they 1 335 64
will 1 335 64
go 1 335 64
away—with 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
help 0 335 64
of 0 335 64
sycophants 1 335 64
in 1 335 64
the 1 335 64
Vatican 1 335 64
press 1 335 64
corps 1 335 64
and 1 335 64
shifty 1 335 64
polemicists 1 335 64
like 0 335 64
Shea, 0 335 64
who 0 335 64
expects 1 335 64
his 1 335 64
readers 1 335 64
to 1 335 64
swallow 1 335 64
his 1 335 64
explanation 1 335 64
that 0 335 64
Bergoglio’s 0 335 64
refusal 0 335 64
to 0 335 64
say 0 335 64
anything 0 335 64
in 0 335 64
his 0 335 64
defense 0 335 64
when 0 335 64
asked 0 335 64
point 0 335 64
blank 0 335 64
about 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
charges 0 335 64
against 0 335 64
him 0 335 64
“seems 0 335 64
to 0 335 64
me 0 335 64
to 0 335 64
obviously 0 335 64
be 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
reply 0 335 64
of 0 335 64
somebody 0 335 64
who 0 335 64
believes 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
accusations 0 335 64
are 0 335 64
groundless…”. 0 335 64

Seems 0 335 65
to 0 335 65
be. 0 335 65

Obviously. 0 335 66

The 1 335 67
American 1 335 67

Expansion 0 335 67

While 0 335 68
events 0 335 68
have 0 335 68
overtaken 0 335 68
Faggioli’s 0 335 68
piece, 0 335 68
it 0 335 68
will 0 335 68
remain 0 335 68
useful 0 335 68
here 0 335 68
as 0 335 68
a 0 335 68
prime 0 335 68
example 0 335 68
of 0 335 68
the 0 335 68
neo-Catholic 0 335 68
polemic. 0 335 68

That 0 335 69
polemic 0 335 69
seeks 0 335 69
to 0 335 69
shore 0 335 69
up 0 335 69
the 0 335 69
collapsing 0 335 69
Novus 0 335 69
Ordo 0 335 69
establishment 0 335 69
lest 0 335 69
it 0 335 69
give 0 335 69
way 0 335 69
to 0 335 69
the 1 335 69
dreaded 1 335 69
traditionalist 1 335 69
revival. 1 335 69

But 0 335 70
before 0 335 70
I 0 335 70
address 0 335 70
Faggioli’s 0 335 70
latest 0 335 70
defense 0 335 70
of 0 335 70
the 0 335 70
indefensible, 0 335 70
some 0 335 70
background 0 335 70
is 0 335 70
in 0 335 70
order, 0 335 70
including 0 335 70
a 0 335 70
discussion 0 335 70
of 0 335 70
further 0 335 70
key 0 335 70
details 0 335 70
of 0 335 70
Viganò’s 0 335 70
testimony. 0 335 70

First 0 335 71
of 0 335 71
all, 0 335 71
as 0 335 71
I 0 335 71
predicted 0 335 71
16 0 335 71
years 0 335 71
ago, 0 335 71
because 0 335 71
the 0 335 71
Vatican 0 335 71
under 0 335 71
John 0 335 71
Paul 0 335 71
II 0 335 71
had 0 335 71
no 0 335 71
intention 0 335 71
of 0 335 71
enforcing 0 335 71
the 0 335 71
pre-conciliar 0 335 71
ban 0 335 71
on 0 335 71
admission 0 335 71
of 0 335 71
homosexuals 0 335 71
to 0 335 71
the 0 335 71
seminary 0 335 71
“a 0 335 71
new 1 335 71
bumper 1 335 71
crop 1 335 71
of 1 335 71
homosexual 1 335 71
ordinands 1 335 71
is 0 335 71
guaranteed—and 0 335 71
with 0 335 71
it 0 335 71
a 1 335 71
new 1 335 71
harvest 1 335 71
of 1 335 71
scandal 1 335 71
for 1 335 71
the 1 335 71
Church.” 1 335 71
That 0 335 71
prediction 0 335 71
came 0 335 71
immediately 0 335 71
after 0 335 71
the 1 335 71
“pedophile 1 335 71
summit” 1 335 71
of 1 335 71
2002 1 335 71
in 1 335 71
Rome, 1 335 71
which 0 335 71
I 0 335 71
attended 0 335 71
as 0 335 71
The 0 335 71
Remnant’s 0 335 71
correspondent. 0 335 71

In 0 335 72
answer 0 335 72
to 0 335 72
my 0 335 72
question 0 335 72
then 0 335 72
head 0 335 72
of 0 335 72
the 0 335 72
USCCB, 0 335 72
Wilton 0 335 72
Gregory, 0 335 72
made 0 335 72
an 1 335 72
explosive 1 335 72
admission 1 335 72
reportedby 0 335 72
the 0 335 72
international 0 335 72
press: 0 335 72
“it 0 335 72
is 0 335 72
an 0 335 72
ongoing 0 335 72
struggle 0 335 72
to 0 335 72
make 0 335 72
sure 0 335 72
that 0 335 72
the 0 335 72
Catholic 0 335 72
priesthood 0 335 72
is 0 335 72
not 0 335 72
dominated 0 335 72
by 0 335 72
homosexual 0 335 72
men.” 0 335 72
The 1 335 72
struggle, 1 335 72
to 1 335 72
the 1 335 72
extent 1 335 72
there 1 335 72
even 1 335 72
was 1 335 72
one, 1 335 72
obviously 1 335 72
has 1 335 72
been 1 335 72
lost. 1 335 72

Sixteen 0 335 73
years 0 335 73
later, 0 335 73
the 1 335 73
homosexual 1 335 73
predator 1 335 73
McCarrick 0 335 73
has 0 335 73
finally 0 335 73
been 0 335 73
exposed 0 335 73
to 0 335 73
the 0 335 73
world, 0 335 73
stripped 0 335 73
of 0 335 73
his 0 335 73
cardinal’s 0 335 73
hat 0 335 73
and 0 335 73
deprived 0 335 73
of 0 335 73
any 0 335 73
ministry, 0 335 73
but 0 335 73
only 0 335 73
after 0 335 73
international 0 335 73
media 0 335 73
coverage 0 335 73
of 0 335 73
the 0 335 73
Vatican’s 0 335 73
semi-secret 0 335 73
finding 0 335 73
that 0 335 73
McCarrick 0 335 73
had 0 335 73
raped 0 335 73
a 0 335 73
teenage 0 335 73
altar 0 335 73
boy 0 335 73
47 0 335 73
years 0 335 73
ago. 0 335 73

If 0 335 74
not 0 335 74
for 0 335 74
that 0 335 74
one 0 335 74
case, 0 335 74
McCarrick’s 0 335 74
sixty 0 335 74
years 0 335 74
of 0 335 74
homosexual 1 335 74
debauchery 1 335 74
might 0 335 74
well 0 335 74
have 0 335 74
gone 0 335 74
unpunished 0 335 74
in 0 335 74
this 0 335 74
world 0 335 74
and 0 335 74
he 0 335 74
would 0 335 74
have 0 335 74
died 0 335 74
still 0 335 74
possessed 0 335 74
of 0 335 74
all 0 335 74
the 0 335 74
phony 1 335 74
honors 1 335 74
that 0 335 74
had 0 335 74
been 0 335 74
heaped 0 335 74
upon 0 335 74
him 0 335 74
throughout 0 335 74
his 0 335 74
career 0 335 74
as 0 335 74
a 1 335 74
parasite 1 335 74
in 1 335 74
the 1 335 74
Body 1 335 74
of 1 335 74
Christ, 1 335 74
including 0 335 74
the 0 335 74
favor 0 335 74
shown 0 335 74
to 0 335 74
him 0 335 74
by 0 335 74
Bergoglio. 0 335 74

The 0 335 75
telling 0 335 75
details 0 335 75
of 0 335 75
Archbishop 0 335 75
Viganò’s 0 335 75
testimony 0 335 75
concerning 0 335 75
Bergoglio’s 0 335 75
friendly 0 335 75
relations 0 335 75
with 0 335 75
McCarrick 0 335 75
before 0 335 75
he 0 335 75
finally 0 335 75
had 0 335 75
to 0 335 75
cut 0 335 75
him 0 335 75
loose—details 1 335 75
conveniently 1 335 75
ignored 1 335 75
by 1 335 75
Winters, 1 335 75
Allen 1 335 75
and 1 335 75
Shea—are 1 335 75
utterly 1 335 75
devastating 1 335 75
to 0 335 75
any 0 335 75
defense 0 335 75
of 0 335 75
Bergoglio. 0 335 75

This 0 335 76
would 0 335 76
explain 0 335 76
why 0 335 76
he 0 335 76
will 0 335 76
not 0 335 76
a 0 335 76
“say 0 335 76
a 0 335 76
word 0 335 76
about” 0 335 76
Viganò’s 0 335 76
charges 0 335 76
against 0 335 76
him. 0 335 76

The 0 335 77
Archbishop 0 335 77
reveals, 0 335 77
as 0 335 77
already 0 335 77
noted, 0 335 77
that 0 335 77
Pope 0 335 77
Benedict 0 335 77
imposed 0 335 77
sanctions 0 335 77
on 0 335 77
McCarrick 0 335 77
under 0 335 77
which 0 335 77
he 0 335 77
“was 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
leave 0 335 77
the 0 335 77
seminary 0 335 77
where 0 335 77
he 0 335 77
was 0 335 77
living, 0 335 77
he 0 335 77
was 0 335 77
forbidden 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
celebrate 0 335 77
[Mass] 0 335 77
in 0 335 77
public, 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
participate 0 335 77
in 0 335 77
public 0 335 77
meetings, 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
give 0 335 77
lectures, 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
travel, 0 335 77
with 0 335 77
the 0 335 77
obligation 0 335 77
of 0 335 77
dedicating 0 335 77
himself 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
a 0 335 77
life 0 335 77
of 0 335 77
prayer 0 335 77
and 0 335 77
penance.” 0 335 77
Viganò 0 335 77
further 0 335 77
reveals 0 335 77
that 0 335 77
those 0 335 77
sanctions 0 335 77
were 0 335 77
communicated 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
McCarrick 0 335 77
by 0 335 77
then 0 335 77
Apostolic 0 335 77
Nuncio 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
the 0 335 77
United 0 335 77
States, 0 335 77
Pietro 0 335 77
Sambi, 0 335 77
but 0 335 77
were 0 335 77
also 0 335 77
repeated 0 335 77
by 0 335 77
Viganò 0 335 77
himself 0 335 77
when 0 335 77
he 0 335 77
succeeded 0 335 77
Sambi 0 335 77
as 0 335 77
Nuncio: 0 335 77

I 0 335 78
repeated 0 335 78
them 0 335 78
to 0 335 78
Cardinal 0 335 78
McCarrick 0 335 78
at 0 335 78
my 0 335 78
first 0 335 78
meeting 0 335 78
with 0 335 78
him 0 335 78
at 0 335 78
the 0 335 78
Nunciature. 0 335 78

The 0 335 79
Cardinal, 0 335 79
muttering 1 335 79
in 1 335 79
a 1 335 79
barely 1 335 79
comprehensible 1 335 79
way, 1 335 79
admitted 0 335 79
that 0 335 79
he 0 335 79
had 0 335 79
perhaps 1 335 79
made 1 335 79
the 1 335 79
mistake 1 335 79
of 1 335 79
sleeping 1 335 79
in 1 335 79
the 1 335 79
same 1 335 79
bed 1 335 79
with 1 335 79
some 1 335 79
seminarians 1 335 79
at 1 335 79
his 1 335 79
beach 1 335 79
house, 1 335 79
but 0 335 79
he 0 335 79
said 0 335 79
this 0 335 79
as 0 335 79
if 0 335 79
it 0 335 79
had 0 335 79
no 0 335 79
importance. 0 335 79

Viganò 0 335 80
testifies 0 335 80
that 0 335 80
on 0 335 80
June 0 335 80
23, 0 335 80
2013, 0 335 80
he 0 335 80
obtained 0 335 80
a 0 335 80
private 0 335 80
audience 0 335 80
with 0 335 80
Bergoglio 0 335 80
after 0 335 80
having 0 335 80
encountered 0 335 80
McCarrick 0 335 80
at 0 335 80
the 0 335 80
Pope’s 0 335 80
residence 0 335 80
three 0 335 80
days 0 335 80
earlier, 0 335 80
during 0 335 80
which 0 335 80
encounter 0 335 80
McCarrick 0 335 80
had 0 335 80
told 0 335 80
him 0 335 80
with 0 335 80
an 0 335 80
air 0 335 80
of 0 335 80
triumph: 0 335 80
“The 0 335 80
Pope 0 335 80
received 0 335 80
me 0 335 80
yesterday, 0 335 80
tomorrow 0 335 80
I 0 335 80
am 0 335 80
going 0 335 80
to 0 335 80
China” 0 335 80
(evidently 0 335 80
to 0 335 80
assist 0 335 80
in 0 335 80
negotiating 0 335 80
Bergoglio’s 0 335 80
planned 1 335 80
sellout 1 335 80
of 0 335 80
China’s 1 335 80
underground 1 335 80
Catholics 1 335 80
to 0 335 80
the 0 335 80
Communist 1 335 80
dictators 1 335 80
of 1 335 80
Beijing). 1 335 80

Viganò 0 335 81
wanted 0 335 81
to 0 335 81
know 0 335 81
why 0 335 81
McCarrick 0 335 81
had 0 335 81
apparently 0 335 81
been 0 335 81
relieved 0 335 81
of 0 335 81
the 0 335 81
sanctions. 0 335 81

During 0 335 82
the 0 335 82
audience 0 335 82
Bergoglio 0 335 82
queried: 0 335 82
“What 0 335 82
is 0 335 82
Cardinal 0 335 82
McCarrick 0 335 82
like?” 0 335 82
and 0 335 82
Viganò 0 335 82
replied 0 335 82
with 0 335 82
the 0 335 82
truth 0 335 82
Bergoglio 0 335 82
obviously 0 335 82
did 0 335 82
not 0 335 82
want 0 335 82
to 0 335 82
hear: 0 335 82

I 0 335 83
answered 0 335 83
him 0 335 83
with 0 335 83
complete 0 335 83
frankness 0 335 83
and, 0 335 83
if 0 335 83
you 0 335 83
want, 0 335 83
with 0 335 83
great 0 335 83
naiveté: 0 335 83
“Holy 0 335 83
Father, 0 335 83
I 0 335 83
don’t 0 335 83
know 0 335 83
if 0 335 83
you 0 335 83
know 0 335 83
Cardinal 0 335 83
McCarrick, 0 335 83
but 0 335 83
if 0 335 83
you 0 335 83
ask 0 335 83
the 0 335 83
Congregation 0 335 83
for 0 335 83
Bishops 0 335 83
there 0 335 83
is 0 335 83
a 0 335 83
dossier 0 335 83
this 0 335 83
thick 0 335 83
about 0 335 83
him. 0 335 83

He 0 335 84
corrupted 0 335 84
generations 0 335 84
of 0 335 84
seminarians 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
priests 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
Pope 0 335 84
Benedict 0 335 84
ordered 0 335 84
him 0 335 84
to 0 335 84
withdraw 0 335 84
to 0 335 84
a 0 335 84
life 0 335 84
of 0 335 84
prayer 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
penance.” 0 335 84
The 0 335 84
Pope 0 335 84
did 0 335 84
not 0 335 84
make 0 335 84
the 0 335 84
slightest 0 335 84
comment 0 335 84
about 0 335 84
those 0 335 84
very 1 335 84
grave 1 335 84
words 1 335 84
of 1 335 84
mine 1 335 84
and 0 335 84
did 0 335 84
not 0 335 84
show 0 335 84
any 0 335 84
expression 0 335 84
of 0 335 84
surprise 0 335 84
on 0 335 84
his 0 335 84
face, 0 335 84
as 0 335 84
if 0 335 84
he 0 335 84
had 0 335 84
already 0 335 84
known 0 335 84
the 0 335 84
matter 0 335 84
for 0 335 84
some 0 335 84
time, 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
he 0 335 84
immediately 0 335 84
changed 0 335 84
the 0 335 84
subject. 0 335 84

But 0 335 85
then, 0 335 85
what 0 335 85
was 0 335 85
the 0 335 85
Pope’s 0 335 85
purpose 0 335 85
in 0 335 85
asking 0 335 85
me 0 335 85
that 0 335 85
question: 0 335 85
“What 0 335 85
is 0 335 85
Cardinal 0 335 85
McCarrick 0 335 85
like?” 0 335 85
He 1 335 85
clearly 1 335 85
wanted 1 335 85
to 1 335 85
find 1 335 85
out 1 335 85
if 1 335 85
I 1 335 85
was 1 335 85
an 1 335 85
ally 1 335 85
of 1 335 85
McCarrick 1 335 85
or 1 335 85
not…. 1 335 85

It 0 335 86
was 0 335 86
also 0 335 86
clear 0 335 86
that, 0 335 86
from 0 335 86
the 0 335 86
time 0 335 86
of 0 335 86
Pope 0 335 86
Francis’s 0 335 86
election, 0 335 86
McCarrick, 0 335 86
now 0 335 86
free 0 335 86
from 0 335 86
all 0 335 86
constraints, 0 335 86
had 0 335 86
felt 0 335 86
free 0 335 86
to 0 335 86
travel 0 335 86
continuously, 0 335 86
to 0 335 86
give 0 335 86
lectures 0 335 86
and 0 335 86
interviews…. 0 335 86

He 0 335 87
[Bergoglio] 0 335 87
knew 0 335 87
from 0 335 87
at 0 335 87
least 0 335 87
June 0 335 87
23, 0 335 87
2013 0 335 87
[the 0 335 87
date 0 335 87
of 0 335 87
the 0 335 87
audience 0 335 87
with 0 335 87
Viganò] 0 335 87
that 0 335 87
McCarrick 0 335 87
was 0 335 87
a 1 335 87
serial 1 335 87
predator. 1 335 87

Although 0 335 88
he 0 335 88
knew 0 335 88
that 0 335 88
he 0 335 88
was 0 335 88
a 0 335 88
corrupt 1 335 88
man, 1 335 88
he 0 335 88
covered 0 335 88
for 0 335 88
him 0 335 88
to 1 335 88
the 1 335 88
bitter 1 335 88
end; 1 335 88
indeed, 0 335 88
he 0 335 88
made 0 335 88
McCarrick’s 0 335 88
advice 0 335 88
his 0 335 88
own, 0 335 88
which 0 335 88
was 0 335 88
certainly 0 335 88
not 0 335 88
inspired 0 335 88
by 0 335 88
sound 0 335 88
intentions 0 335 88
and 0 335 88
for 0 335 88
love 0 335 88
of 0 335 88
the 0 335 88
Church. 0 335 88

It 0 335 89
was 0 335 89
only 0 335 89
when 0 335 89
he 0 335 89
was 0 335 89
forced 0 335 89
by 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
report 0 335 89
of 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
abuse 0 335 89
of 0 335 89
a 0 335 89
minor, 0 335 89
again 0 335 89
on 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
basis 0 335 89
of 0 335 89
media 0 335 89
attention, 0 335 89
that 0 335 89
he 0 335 89
took 0 335 89
action 0 335 89
to 0 335 89
save 0 335 89
his 0 335 89
image 0 335 89
in 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
media. 0 335 89

[all 0 335 90
emphasis 0 335 90
in 0 335 90
original] 0 335 90

Before 0 335 91
his 0 335 91
long 0 335 91
overdue 0 335 91
fall 0 335 91
McCarrick, 0 335 91
as 0 335 91
Bergoglio’s 1 335 91
“trusted 1 335 91
counselor,” 1 335 91
had 0 335 91
been 0 335 91
instrumental 0 335 91
in 0 335 91
cementing 0 335 91
into 0 335 91
place 0 335 91
the 0 335 91
homosexual-friendly 0 335 91
status 0 335 91
quo 0 335 91
of 0 335 91
the 0 335 91
American 0 335 91
episcopate 0 335 91
that 0 335 91
oppresses 0 335 91
and 0 335 91
defrauds 0 335 91
the 0 335 91
faithful. 0 335 91

It 0 335 92
was 0 335 92
McCarrick, 0 335 92
noted 0 335 92
Marco 0 335 92
Tosatti, 0 335 92
who 0 335 92
was 0 335 92
behind 0 335 92
the 0 335 92
elevation 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Blase 0 335 92
Cupich 0 335 92
to 0 335 92
the 0 335 92
key 0 335 92
position 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Archbishop 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Chicago, 0 335 92
where 0 335 92
Cupich 0 335 92
has 0 335 92
since 0 335 92
promoted 0 335 92
the 0 335 92
homosexual 0 335 92
subversion 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Father 0 335 92
James 0 335 92
Martin. 0 335 92

And 0 335 93
Viganò 0 335 93
now 0 335 93
confirms 0 335 93
Tosatti’s 0 335 93
allegation: 0 335 93
“The 0 335 93
appointments 0 335 93
of 0 335 93
Blase 0 335 93
Cupich 0 335 93
to 0 335 93
Chicago 0 335 93
and 0 335 93
Joseph 0 335 93
W. 0 335 93
Tobin 0 335 93
to 0 335 93
Newark 0 335 93
were 0 335 93
orchestrated 0 335 93
by 0 335 93
McCarrick, 0 335 93
Maradiaga 0 335 93
and 0 335 93
Wuerl, 0 335 93
united 1 335 93
by 1 335 93
a 1 335 93
wicked 1 335 93
pact 1 335 93
of 1 335 93
abuses 1 335 93
by 1 335 93
the 1 335 93
first, 1 335 93
and 1 335 93
at 1 335 93
least 1 335 93
of 1 335 93
coverup 1 335 93
of 1 335 93
abuses 1 335 93
by 1 335 93
the 1 335 93
other 1 335 93
two. 1 335 93

Their 0 335 94
names 0 335 94
were 0 335 94
not 0 335 94
among 0 335 94
those 0 335 94
presented 0 335 94
by 0 335 94
the 0 335 94
Nunciature 0 335 94
for 0 335 94
Chicago 0 335 94
and 0 335 94
Newark.” 0 335 94
That 0 335 94
is, 0 335 94
the 0 335 94
normal 0 335 94
process 0 335 94
was 0 335 94
circumvented 0 335 94
for 0 335 94
these 0 335 94
appointments. 0 335 94

Remnant 0 335 95
readers 0 335 95
may 0 335 95
recall 0 335 95
that 0 335 95
I 0 335 95
spotted 0 335 95
Cupich 0 335 95
back 0 335 95
in 0 335 95
2002, 0 335 95
when 0 335 95
he 0 335 95
was 0 335 95
the 1 335 95
obscure 1 335 95
Bishop 1 335 95
of 1 335 95
Rapid 1 335 95
City, 1 335 95
South 0 335 95
Dakota, 0 335 95
as 0 335 95
an 0 335 95
example 0 335 95
of 0 335 95
what 0 335 95
was 0 335 95
coming 0 335 95
in 0 335 95
the 0 335 95
Novus 0 335 95
Ordo: 0 335 95
accelerated 1 335 95
degeneration. 1 335 95

As 0 335 96
I 0 335 96
wrote 0 335 96
back 0 335 96
then, 0 335 96
with 0 335 96
the 0 335 96
likes 0 335 96
of 0 335 96
Cupich 0 335 96
in 0 335 96
view: 0 335 96

Cupich 0 335 97
is 0 335 97
the 0 335 97
very 0 335 97
model 0 335 97
of 0 335 97
a 0 335 97
Novus 0 335 97
Ordo 0 335 97
bishop. 0 335 97

He 1 335 98
is 1 335 98
the 1 335 98
very 1 335 98
exemplar 1 335 98
of 1 335 98
the 1 335 98
crisis 1 335 98
we 1 335 98
must 1 335 98
still 1 335 98
endure…. 1 335 98

Let 0 335 99
the 0 335 99
thing 0 335 99
die 0 335 99
of 0 335 99
its 0 335 99
own 0 335 99
excesses, 0 335 99
for 0 335 99
as 0 335 99
the 0 335 99
“little 0 335 99
synod” 0 335 99
[the 1 335 99
2002 1 335 99
“pedophile 1 335 99
summit”] 1 335 99
demonstrates, 0 335 99
the 1 335 99
men 1 335 99
who 1 335 99
control 1 335 99
this 1 335 99
establishment 1 335 99
will 1 335 99
never 1 335 99
restore 1 335 99
it 1 335 99
to 1 335 99
anything 1 335 99
resembling 1 335 99
the 1 335 99
vibrant 1 335 99
Church 1 335 99
that 1 335 99
a 1 335 99
long 1 335 99
line 1 335 99
of 1 335 99
militant, 1 335 99
uncompromising 1 335 99
Popes 1 335 99
delivered 1 335 99
into 1 335 99
their 1 335 99
hands 1 335 99
at 1 335 99
Vatican 1 335 99
II. 1 335 99

For 1 335 100
heaven’s 1 335 100
sake, 1 335 100
the 0 335 100
men 0 335 100
who 0 335 100
govern 0 335 100
the 0 335 100
Church 0 335 100
today 0 335 100
require 0 335 100
a 0 335 100
Vatican 0 335 100
summit 0 335 100
meeting 0 335 100
to 0 335 100
agonize 1 335 100
over 1 335 100
whether 0 335 100
serial 1 335 100
child 1 335 100
molesters 1 335 100
should 0 335 100
be 0 335 100
defrocked. 0 335 100

From 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
Vatican 0 335 101
on 0 335 101
down, 0 335 101
through 0 335 101
deliberate 0 335 101
decisions 0 335 101
and 0 335 101
criminal 0 335 101
neglect, 0 335 101
the 1 335 101
servitors 1 335 101
of 1 335 101
Vatican 1 335 101
II 1 335 101
have 1 335 101
laid 1 335 101
waste 1 335 101
to 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
liturgy, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
perennial 0 335 101
clarity 0 335 101
of 0 335 101
Catholic 0 335 101
teaching, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
Church’s 0 335 101
militant 0 335 101
opposition 0 335 101
to 0 335 101
worldly 0 335 101
thinking, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
traditional 0 335 101
formation 0 335 101
in 0 335 101
seminaries, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
religious 0 335 101
orders, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
missions, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
trust 0 335 101
of 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
faithful 0 335 101
in 0 335 101
their 0 335 101
own 0 335 101
priests—in 0 335 101
short, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
very 0 335 101
life 0 335 101
of 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
Church—and 0 335 101
dare 0 335 101
to 0 335 101
call 0 335 101
it 0 335 101
a 0 335 101
renewal. 0 335 101

We 1 335 102
must 1 335 102
no 1 335 102
longer 1 335 102
subsidize 1 335 102
the 1 335 102
malpractice 1 335 102
of 1 335 102
the 1 335 102
architects 1 335 102
of 1 335 102
ruin. 1 335 102

Nor 1 335 103
must 1 335 103
we 1 335 103
join 1 335 103
the 1 335 103
neo-Catholics 1 335 103
in 1 335 103
their 1 335 103
mindless 1 335 103
applause 1 335 103
when 1 335 103
one 1 335 103
of 1 335 103
these 1 335 103
incompetents 1 335 103
attempts 1 335 103
to 1 335 103
repoint 1 335 103
a 1 335 103

or 1 335 103

the 1 335 103
crumbling 1 335 103

have 1 335 103
erected 1 335 103

the 1 335 103
Church 1 335 103
of 1 335 103

As 0 335 104
for 0 335 104
William 1 335 104
(“nighty-night 1 335 104
baby!”) 1 335 104
Tobin, 1 335 104
after 0 335 104
McCarrick 0 335 104
had 0 335 104
arranged 0 335 104
for 0 335 104
him 0 335 104
to 0 335 104
become 0 335 104
Archbishop 0 335 104
of 0 335 104
Newark, 0 335 104
Tobin, 0 335 104
another 1 335 104
episcopal 1 335 104
booster 1 335 104
of 1 335 104
Martin’s 1 335 104
pro-homosexual 1 335 104
propaganda, 1 335 104
promptly 0 335 104
sponsored 0 335 104
a 0 335 104
“gay 0 335 104
pilgrimage” 0 335 104
to 0 335 104
his 0 335 104
cathedral 0 335 104
in 0 335 104
Newark. 0 335 104

And 0 335 105
it 0 335 105
was 0 335 105
McCarrick 0 335 105
who 0 335 105
obtained 0 335 105
the 0 335 105
cardinal’s 0 335 105
hat 0 335 105
for 0 335 105
his 0 335 105
roommate 0 335 105
of 0 335 105
six 0 335 105
years, 0 335 105
Kevin 0 335 105
Farrell, 0 335 105
whom 0 335 105
he 0 335 105
consecrated 0 335 105
a 0 335 105
bishop. 0 335 105

Farrell, 0 335 106
yet 1 335 106
another 1 335 106
promoter 1 335 106
of 1 335 106
Martin’s 1 335 106
homosexual 1 335 106
activism, 1 335 106
arranged 0 335 106
for 0 335 106
Martin 0 335 106
to 0 335 106
“welcome 0 335 106
‘gay’ 0 335 106

Dublin 0 335 106
from 0 335 106
which 0 335 106
Bergoglio 0 335 106
has 0 335 106
just 0 335 106
returned. 0 335 106

Finally, 0 335 107
there 0 335 107
is 0 335 107
the 0 335 107
appointment 0 335 107

Bishop 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
San 0 335 107
Diego, 0 335 107
concerning 0 335 107
which 0 335 107
Viganò 0 335 107
reveals: 0 335 107
“The 0 335 107

Cupich, 0 335 107
Tobin 0 335 107
and 0 335 107
Farrell, 0 335 107
McElroy 0 335 107
is 0 335 107
an 1 335 107

Church, 1 335 107
calling 0 335 107
opposition 0 335 107
to 0 335 107
Martin 0 335 107
symptomatic 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
a 0 335 107
“cancer 1 335 107
of 1 335 107
vilification 1 335 107
[that] 0 335 107
is 0 335 107
seeping 0 335 107
into 0 335 107

life 0 335 107
of 0 335 107

Emboldened 0 335 108
by 0 335 108
the 0 335 108
certainty 0 335 108
that 0 335 108
he 0 335 108
will 0 335 108
face 0 335 108
no 0 335 108
discipline 0 335 108
whatsoever, 0 335 108
Martin, 0 335 108
now 0 335 108
backed 0 335 108
by 0 335 108
“Cupich, 0 335 108
Tobin, 0 335 108
Farrell 0 335 108
and 0 335 108
McElroy,” 0 335 108
as 0 335 108
Viganò 0 335 108
testifies, 0 335 108
is 0 335 108
urging 0 335 108
all 0 335 108
the 0 335 108
“gay 0 335 108
priests” 0 335 108
to 0 335 108
“come 0 335 108
out,” 0 335 108
including 0 335 108
those 0 335 108
ordained 0 335 108
since 0 335 108
the 0 335 108
useless 0 335 108
“pedophile 1 335 108
summit” 1 335 108
presided 0 335 108
over 0 335 108
by 0 335 108
none 0 335 108
other 0 335 108
than 0 335 108
McCarrick 0 335 108
as 0 335 108
the 1 335 108
classic 1 335 108
fox 1 335 108
in 1 335 108
charge 1 335 108
of 1 335 108
the 1 335 108
hen 1 335 108
house. 1 335 108

But 0 335 109
Bergoglio 0 335 109
has 0 335 109
also 0 335 109
lent 0 335 109
his 0 335 109
own 0 335 109
authority 0 335 109
to 0 335 109
Martin’s 0 335 109
effort 0 335 109

mainstream 0 335 109
homosexuality 0 335 109
in 0 335 109
the 0 335 109
Church. 0 335 109

As 0 335 110
Viganò 0 335 110
notes, 0 335 110
it 0 335 110
was 0 335 110
Bergoglio 0 335 110
who 0 335 110
made 0 335 110
Martin 0 335 110
a 0 335 110
“Consultor 0 335 110

even 0 335 110
though 0 335 110
he 0 335 110
is 0 335 110
a 1 335 110
“well-known 1 335 110

agenda, 1 335 110
chosen 1 335 110
to 1 335 110

the 1 335 110
young 1 335 110
people 1 335 110

will 1 335 110
soon 1 335 110
gather 1 335 110
in 1 335 110
Dublin 1 335 110
for 1 335 110
the 1 335 110
World 1 335 110

of 1 335 110
Families…” 1 335 110

“Father” 0 335 111
Martin 0 335 111
now 0 335 111
confidently 0 335 111
declares, 0 335 111
sixteen 0 335 111
years 0 335 111
after 0 335 111
the 0 335 111
“pedophile 1 335 111
summit,” 1 335 111
that 0 335 111
“The 1 335 111
idea 1 335 111
of 1 335 111
a 1 335 111
purge 1 335 111
of 1 335 111
gay 1 335 111
priests 1 335 111
is 1 335 111
both 1 335 111
ridiculous 1 335 111
and 1 335 111
dangerous. 1 335 111

Any 1 335 112
purge 1 335 112
would 1 335 112
empty 1 335 112
parishes 1 335 112
and 1 335 112
religious 1 335 112
orders 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
the 1 335 112
thousands 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
priests 1 335 112
and 1 335 112
bishops 1 335 112
who 1 335 112
lead 1 335 112
healthy 1 335 112
lives 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
service 1 335 112
and 1 335 112
faithful 1 335 112
lives 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
celibacy.” 1 335 112

Martin 0 335 113
thus 0 335 113
revels 1 335 113
in 1 335 113
smug 1 335 113
certitude 1 335 113
that 0 335 113
the 0 335 113
future 0 335 113
of 0 335 113
the 0 335 113
universal 0 335 113

in 0 335 113
the 0 335 113
hands 0 335 113
of 0 335 113
legions 1 335 113
of 1 335 113
intrinsically 1 335 113
disordered 1 335 113

their 0 335 113
homosexual 0 335 113
successors, 0 335 113
who 0 335 113

and 0 335 113
that 0 335 113
there 0 335 113
is 0 335 113
absolutely 0 335 113
nothing 0 335 113
we 0 335 113
can 0 335 113
or 0 335 113
should 0 335 113
do 0 335 113
about 0 335 113
it. 0 335 113

A 0 335 114
Worldwide 0 335 114

None 0 335 115
of 0 335 115

foregoing 0 335 115
is 0 335 115
meant 0 335 115
to 0 335 115
suggest 0 335 115
that 0 335 115
the 0 335 115
homosexual 0 335 115
invasion 0 335 115
of 0 335 115
the 0 335 115
Catholic 0 335 115
hierarchy 0 335 115
is 0 335 115
confined 0 335 115
to 0 335 115
American 0 335 115
prelates 0 335 115
and 0 335 115
priests. 0 335 115

The 0 335 116
spread 0 335 116
of 0 335 116
clerical 1 335 116
sodomy 1 335 116

not 0 335 116
respected 0 335 116

but 0 335 116
rather 0 335 116
extends 0 335 116
throughout 0 335 116
the 0 335 116
Church 0 335 116
under 0 335 116
the 0 335 116
eyes 0 335 116
of 0 335 116
a 0 335 116
Vatican 0 335 116
apparatus 0 335 116
that 0 335 116
is 0 335 116
itself 0 335 116
thoroughly 1 335 116
infested 1 335 116
with 1 335 116
homosexuals. 1 335 116

This 0 335 117
is 0 335 117
thanks 0 335 117
in 0 335 117
large 0 335 117
measure 0 335 117
to 0 335 117
Bergoglio, 0 335 117
who 0 335 117
made 0 335 117
a 1 335 117
flagrantly 1 335 117
active 1 335 117
homosexual, 1 335 117
Monsignor 0 335 117
Battista 0 335 117
Ricca, 0 335 117
“prelate 1 335 117
of 1 335 117

gay 1 335 117

no 0 335 117
less 0 335 117
than 0 335 117
head 0 335 117
of 0 335 117
his 0 335 117
papal 0 335 117
household. 0 335 117

Moreover, 0 335 118
it 0 335 118
was 0 335 118
Bergoglio’s 0 335 118
right 0 335 118
hand 0 335 118
man, 0 335 118
Cardinal 0 335 118
Maradiaga, 0 335 118
who 0 335 118
sheltered 0 335 118
his 0 335 118
friend, 0 335 118
Juan 0 335 118
José 0 335 118
Pineda, 0 335 118
auxiliary 0 335 118
Bishop 0 335 118
of 0 335 118
Tegucigalpa, 0 335 118
from 0 335 118
any 0 335 118

over 0 335 118
his 0 335 118
notorious 0 335 118
homosexual 0 335 118
liaisons 0 335 118
with 0 335 118
seminarians 0 335 118
in 0 335 118
that 0 335 118
diocese. 0 335 118

When 0 335 119
an 0 335 119
apostolic 0 335 119
visitation, 0 335 119
compelled 0 335 119
by 0 335 119
mounting 0 335 119
public 0 335 119
pressure, 0 335 119
confirmed 0 335 119
the 0 335 119
charges 0 335 119
against 0 335 119
Pineda, 0 335 119
he 0 335 119
was 0 335 119
forced 0 335 119
to 0 335 119
resign, 0 335 119
even 0 335 119
as 0 335 119
Maradiaga 0 335 119
dismissed 0 335 119
the 0 335 119
incontestable 0 335 119
proofs 0 335 119
against 0 335 119
him 0 335 119
as 0 335 119
“slander.” 0 335 119
Viganò 0 335 119
notes 0 335 119
that 0 335 119

with 0 335 135
a 0 335 135
screaming 1 335 135
headline: 1 335 135
“Pope 1 335 135
Francis 1 335 135
Must 1 335 135
Resign.” 1 335 135

Nearly 0 335 136
three 0 335 136
years 0 335 136
ago, 0 335 136
seeing 0 335 136
what 0 335 136
was 0 335 136
certainly 0 335 136
coming 0 335 136
on 0 335 136
the 0 335 136
disastrous 1 335 136
course 0 335 136
Bergoglio 0 335 136
had 0 335 136
already 0 335 136
clearly 0 335 136
established, 0 335 136
this 0 335 136
newspaper 0 335 136
published 0 335 136
a 0 335 136
petition 0 335 136
which 0 335 136
states: 0 335 136
“We 0 335 136
your 0 335 136
subjects 0 335 136
respectfully 0 335 136
petition 0 335 136
Your 0 335 136
Holiness 0 335 136
to 0 335 136
change 0 335 136
course 0 335 136
for 0 335 136
the 0 335 136
good 0 335 136
of 0 335 136
the 0 335 136
Church 0 335 136
and 0 335 136
the 0 335 136
welfare 0 335 136
of 0 335 136
souls. 0 335 136

Failing 0 335 137
this, 0 335 137
would 0 335 137
it 0 335 137
not 0 335 137
be 0 335 137
better 0 335 137
for 0 335 137
Your 0 335 137
Holiness 0 335 137

to 0 335 137

over 0 335 137
what 0 335 137
threatens 0 335 137
to 0 335 137
be 0 335 137
a 0 335 137
catastrophic 1 335 137
compromise 1 335 137
of 0 335 137
the 0 335 137
Church’s 0 335 137
integrity?” 0 335 137
Our 0 335 137
petition 0 335 137
was 0 335 137
of 0 335 137
course 0 335 137
dismissed 0 335 137
as 0 335 137
“ridiculous” 1 335 137
by 0 335 137
the 0 335 137
neo-Catholic 0 335 137
commentariat. 0 335 137

Today, 0 335 138
our 0 335 138
ridiculous 0 335 138
suggestion 0 335 138
is 0 335 138
the 0 335 138
stuff 0 335 138
of 0 335 138
mainstream 0 335 138
news. 0 335 138

From 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
neo-Catholic 0 335 139
perspective, 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
events 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
recent 0 335 139
days 0 335 139
present 0 335 139
a 0 335 139
terrifying 1 335 139
prospect: 1 335 139
the 0 335 139
final 0 335 139
collapse 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
Novus 0 335 139
Ordo 0 335 139
establishment, 0 335 139
an 0 335 139
end 0 335 139
to 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
conciliar 0 335 139
aggiornamento 0 335 139
and 0 335 139
a 0 335 139
revival 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
integral 0 335 139
Tradition, 0 335 139
which 0 335 139
growing 0 335 139
numbers 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
young 0 335 139
people 0 335 139
are 0 335 139
seeking. 0 335 139

Hence 0 335 140
even 0 335 140
before 0 335 140
Archbishop 0 335 140
Viganò 0 335 140
had 0 335 140
come 0 335 140
forward, 0 335 140
commentators 0 335 140
like 0 335 140
Faggioli 0 335 140
were 0 335 140
already 0 335 140
sounding 1 335 140
the 1 335 140
neo-Catholic 1 335 140
air 1 335 140
raid 1 335 140
siren. 1 335 140

Faggioli 0 335 141
fretted 1 335 141
that 0 335 141
“[t]he 0 335 141
abuse 0 335 141
scandal 0 335 141
and 0 335 141
delegitimization 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
episcopate 0 335 141
has 0 335 141
created 0 335 141
a 0 335 141
great 0 335 141
power 0 335 141
vacuum 0 335 141
in 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
Church” 0 335 141
that 0 335 141
could 0 335 141
be 0 335 141
filled 0 335 141
by 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
“neo-traditionalist 0 335 141
Catholicism 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
younger 0 335 141
generations 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
American 0 335 141
Catholics” 0 335 141
who 0 335 141
“attack 0 335 141
American 0 335 141
bishops 0 335 141
and 0 335 141
cardinals 0 335 141
close 0 335 141
to 0 335 141
Pope 0 335 141
Francis.” 0 335 141
Accordingly, 0 335 141
he 0 335 141
rushed 0 335 141
to 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
defense 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
Bergoglio 0 335 141
and 0 335 141
his 1 335 141
corrupt 1 335 141
regime 1 335 141
against 0 335 141
“a 0 335 141
radicalization 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
religious 0 335 141
conservatism 0 335 141
in 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
neo-traditionalism 0 335 141
sense...” 0 335 141

For 1 335 142
Faggioli, 1 335 142
not 1 335 142
only 1 335 142
would 1 335 142
Bergoglio’s 1 335 142
resignation 1 335 142
be 1 335 142
unthinkable, 1 335 142
so 1 335 142
also 1 335 142
would 1 335 142
a 1 335 142
purge 1 335 142
of 1 335 142
the 1 335 142
homosexual 1 335 142
and 1 335 142
pro-homosexual 1 335 142
prelates 1 335 142
Bergoglio 1 335 142
and 1 335 142
his 1 335 142
Vatican 1 335 142
henchmen 1 335 142
have 1 335 142
systematically 1 335 142
enabled. 1 335 142

The 0 335 143
Pope, 0 335 143
he 0 335 143
argues, 0 335 143
is 0 335 143
not 0 335 143
“the 1 335 143
CEO 1 335 143
of 1 335 143
the 1 335 143
Catholic 1 335 143
Church 1 335 143
world, 1 335 143
and 0 335 143
the 0 335 143
bishops 0 335 143
as 0 335 143
its 0 335 143
managers 0 335 143
whom 0 335 143
the 0 335 143
Pope 0 335 143
can 0 335 143
simply 0 335 143
fire.” 0 335 143
No, 0 335 143
Bergoglio 0 335 143
cannot 0 335 143
“simply 0 335 143
fire” 0 335 143
bishops. 0 335 143

Except 0 335 144
whenever 0 335 144
he 0 335 144
pleases, 0 335 144
as 0 335 144
we 0 335 144
have 0 335 144
seen 0 335 144
again 0 335 144
and 0 335 144
again 0 335 144
with 0 335 144
the 1 335 144
conservative 1 335 144
bishops 1 335 144
and 1 335 144
even 1 335 144
Cardinals 1 335 144
(Burke 1 335 144
and 1 335 144
Müller) 1 335 144
he 1 335 144
has 1 335 144
sacked 1 335 144
because 1 335 144
their 1 335 144
conservatism 1 335 144
offended 1 335 144
him 1 335 144
or 1 335 144
one 1 335 144
of 1 335 144
his 1 335 144
friends, 1 335 144
prompting 0 335 144
even 0 335 144
Crux 0 335 144
to 0 335 144
ask: 0 335 144
“Does 1 335 144
Pope 1 335 144
Francis 1 335 144
have 1 335 144
an 1 335 144
enemies 1 335 144
list?” 1 335 144
Then 0 335 144
again, 0 335 144
Francis 0 335 144
even 0 335 144
obtained 0 335 144
the 0 335 144
removal 0 335 144
of 0 335 144
his 0 335 144
own 0 335 144
“trusted 1 335 144
counselor” 1 335 144
McCarrick 1 335 144
from 0 335 144
the 0 335 144
College 0 335 144
of 0 335 144
Cardinals, 0 335 144
albeit 0 335 144
only 0 335 144
when 0 335 144
forced 0 335 144
to 0 335 144
act 0 335 144
due 0 335 144
to 0 335 144
worldwide 0 335 144
condemnation 0 335 144
in 0 335 144
the 0 335 144
media. 0 335 144

So, 0 335 145
according 0 335 145
to 0 335 145
Faggioli, 0 335 145
the 1 335 145
same 1 335 145
Pope 1 335 145
who 1 335 145
sacks 1 335 145
conservative 1 335 145
bishops 1 335 145
and 1 335 145
cardinals 1 335 145
according 1 335 145
to 1 335 145
his 1 335 145
pleasure 1 335 145
and 1 335 145
has 1 335 145
just 1 335 145
removed 1 335 145
a 1 335 145
cardinal 1 335 145
from 1 335 145
the 1 335 145
College 1 335 145
of 1 335 145
Cardinals 1 335 145
in 1 335 145
an 1 335 145
unprecedented 1 335 145
disciplinary 1 335 145
act 1 335 145
under 1 335 145
fire 1 335 145
from 1 335 145
the 1 335 145
media, 1 335 145
is 1 335 145
somehow 1 335 145
powerless 1 335 145
to 1 335 145
dismiss 1 335 145
Modernist 1 335 145
bishops 1 335 145
who 1 335 145
have 1 335 145
created 1 335 145
an 1 335 145
obscene 1 335 145
“gay 1 335 145
culture” 1 335 145
in 1 335 145
the 1 335 145
Church 1 335 145
and 1 335 145
replace 1 335 145
them 1 335 145
with 1 335 145
orthodox, 1 335 145
normal 1 335 145
heterosexual 1 335 145
males. 1 335 145

Francis 1 335 146
cannot 1 335 146
“simply 1 335 146
fire” 1 335 146
even 1 335 146
Cardinal 1 335 146
Wuerl, 1 335 146
who 1 335 146
covered 1 335 146
up 1 335 146
crimes 1 335 146
of 1 335 146
homosexual 1 335 146
predation 1 335 146
by 1 335 146
the 1 335 146
priests 1 335 146
he 1 335 146
transferred 1 335 146
elsewhere 1 335 146
while 1 335 146
Archbishop 1 335 146
of 1 335 146
Pittsburgh, 1 335 146
and 1 335 146
who 1 335 146
authorized 1 335 146
payment 1 335 146
of 1 335 146
$900,000 1 335 146
in 1 335 146
hush 1 335 146
money 1 335 146
to 1 335 146
bury 1 335 146
sexual 1 335 146
abuse 1 335 146
claims 1 335 146
against 1 335 146
a 1 335 146
homosexual 1 335 146
priest 1 335 146
involved 1 335 146
in 1 335 146
the 1 335 146
production 1 335 146
of 1 335 146
child 1 335 146
pornography. 1 335 146

Wuerl, 0 335 147
says 0 335 147
Faggioli, 0 335 147
“faces 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
complex 0 335 147
situation: 0 335 147
on 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
one 0 335 147
hand 0 335 147
Wuerl 0 335 147
was 0 335 147
not 0 335 147
afraid 0 335 147
of 0 335 147
clashing 0 335 147
with 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
tribunal 0 335 147
over 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
Apostolic 0 335 147
Signatura 0 335 147
in 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
Vatican 0 335 147
which 0 335 147
wanted 0 335 147
to 0 335 147
readmit 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
priest 0 335 147
from 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
Pittsburgh 0 335 147
diocese 0 335 147
to 0 335 147
ministry… 0 335 147
while 0 335 147
in 0 335 147
other 0 335 147
cases 0 335 147
he 0 335 147
seems 0 335 147
to 0 335 147
have 0 335 147
collaborated 0 335 147
in 0 335 147
covering 0 335 147
up 0 335 147
some 0 335 147
cases… 0 335 147
It 0 335 147
is 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
very 0 335 147
difficult 0 335 147
position 0 335 147
also 0 335 147
because 0 335 147
Wuerl 0 335 147
became 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
symbol… 0 335 147
beyond 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
specific 0 335 147
accusations 0 335 147
against 0 335 147
him, 0 335 147
from 0 335 147
which 0 335 147
he 0 335 147
could 0 335 147
not 0 335 147
publicly 0 335 147
defend 0 335 147
himself.” 0 335 147

In 0 335 148
other 0 335 148
words, 0 335 148
because 0 335 148
his 0 335 148
situation 0 335 148
is 0 335 148
“complex” 0 335 148
Wuerl, 0 335 148
unlike 0 335 148
McCarrick, 0 335 148
should 0 335 148
remain 0 335 148
a 0 335 148
cardinal 0 335 148
and 0 335 148
the 0 335 148
Archbishop 0 335 148
of 0 335 148
Washington, 0 335 148
DC, 0 335 148
thus 0 335 148
maintaining 1 335 148
a 1 335 148
key 1 335 148
bulwark 1 335 148
against 1 335 148
the 1 335 148
“neo-traditionalist” 1 335 148
threat. 1 335 148

Yet, 0 335 149
as 0 335 149
the 0 335 149
Pennsylvania 0 335 149
grand 0 335 149
jury 0 335 149
report 0 335 149

Wuerl 0 335 149
assisted 0 335 149
McCarrick 0 335 149
in 0 335 149
the 0 335 149
coverup 0 335 149
of 0 335 149
his 0 335 149
crimes 0 335 149
and 0 335 149
now 0 335 149
brazenly 1 335 149
lies 1 335 149
about 1 335 149
it. 1 335 149

Here 0 335 150
too 0 335 150
Viganò’s 0 335 150
testimony 0 335 150
sheds 1 335 150
light 1 335 150
on 1 335 150
the 1 335 150
darkness: 1 335 150

…. 0 335 151

I 0 335 152
myself 0 335 152
brought 0 335 152
up 0 335 152
the 0 335 152
subject 0 335 152
[of 0 335 152
McCarrick] 0 335 152
with 0 335 152
Cardinal 0 335 152
Wuerl 0 335 152
on 0 335 152
several 0 335 152
occasions, 0 335 152
and 0 335 152
I 0 335 152
certainly 0 335 152
didn’t 0 335 152
need 0 335 152
to 0 335 152
go 0 335 152
into 0 335 152
detail 0 335 152
because 0 335 152
it 0 335 152
was 0 335 152
immediately 0 335 152
clear 0 335 152
to 0 335 152
me 0 335 152
that 0 335 152
he 0 335 152
was 0 335 152
fully 0 335 152
aware 0 335 152
of 0 335 152
it. 0 335 152

I 0 335 153
also 0 335 153
remember 0 335 153
in 0 335 153
particular 0 335 153
the 0 335 153
fact 0 335 153
that 0 335 153
I 0 335 153
had 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
draw 0 335 153
his 0 335 153
attention 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
it, 0 335 153
because 0 335 153
I 0 335 153
realized 0 335 153
that 0 335 153
in 0 335 153
an 0 335 153
archdiocesan 0 335 153
publication, 0 335 153
on 0 335 153
the 0 335 153
back 0 335 153
cover 0 335 153
in 0 335 153
color, 0 335 153
there 0 335 153
was 0 335 153
an 0 335 153
announcement 0 335 153
inviting 0 335 153
young 0 335 153
men 0 335 153
who 0 335 153
thought 0 335 153
they 0 335 153
had 0 335 153
a 0 335 153
vocation 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
the 0 335 153
priesthood 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
a 0 335 153
meeting 0 335 153
with 0 335 153
Cardinal 0 335 153
McCarrick. 0 335 153

I 0 335 154
immediately 0 335 154
phoned 0 335 154
Cardinal 0 335 154
Wuerl, 0 335 154
who 0 335 154
expressed 0 335 154
his 0 335 154
surprise 0 335 154
to 0 335 154
me, 0 335 154
telling 0 335 154
me 0 335 154
that 0 335 154
he 0 335 154
knew 0 335 154
nothing 0 335 154
about 0 335 154
that 0 335 154
announcement 0 335 154
and 0 335 154
that 0 335 154
he 0 335 154
would 0 335 154
cancel 0 335 154
it. 0 335 154

If, 1 335 155
as 1 335 155
he 1 335 155
now 1 335 155
continues 1 335 155
to 1 335 155
state, 1 335 155
he 1 335 155
knew 1 335 155
nothing 1 335 155
of 1 335 155
the 1 335 155
abuses 1 335 155
committed 1 335 155
by 1 335 155
McCarrick 1 335 155
and 1 335 155
the 1 335 155
measures 1 335 155
taken 1 335 155
by 1 335 155
Pope 1 335 155
Benedict, 1 335 155
how 1 335 155
can 1 335 155
his 1 335 155
answer 1 335 155
be 1 335 155
explained? 1 335 155

His 0 335 156
recent 0 335 156
statements 0 335 156
that 0 335 156
he 0 335 156
knew 0 335 156
nothing 0 335 156
about 0 335 156
it, 0 335 156
even 0 335 156
though 0 335 156
at 0 335 156
first 0 335 156
he 0 335 156
cunningly 0 335 156
referred 0 335 156
to 0 335 156
compensation 0 335 156
for 0 335 156
the 0 335 156
two 0 335 156
victims, 0 335 156
are 0 335 156
absolutely 1 335 156
laughable. 1 335 156

The 0 335 157
Cardinal 0 335 157
lies 1 335 157
shamelessly 1 335 157
and 0 335 157
prevails 0 335 157
upon 0 335 157
his 0 335 157
Chancellor, 0 335 157
Monsignor 0 335 157
Antonicelli, 0 335 157
to 0 335 157
lie 0 335 157
as 0 335 157
well. 0 335 157

Cardinal 0 335 158
Wuerl 0 335 158
also 0 335 158
clearly 0 335 158
lied 0 335 158
on 0 335 158
another 0 335 158
occasion. 0 335 158

Following 0 335 159
a 0 335 159
morally 0 335 159
unacceptable 0 335 159
event 0 335 159
authorized 0 335 159
by 0 335 159
the 0 335 159
academic 0 335 159
authorities 0 335 159
of 0 335 159
Georgetown 0 335 159
University, 0 335 159
I 0 335 159
brought 0 335 159
it 0 335 159
to 0 335 159
the 0 335 159
attention 0 335 159
of 0 335 159
its 0 335 159
President, 0 335 159
Dr. 0 335 159
John 0 335 159
DeGioia, 0 335 159
sending 0 335 159
him 0 335 159
two 0 335 159
subsequent 0 335 159
letters. 0 335 159

Before 0 335 160
forwarding 0 335 160
them 0 335 160
to 0 335 160
the 0 335 160
addressee, 0 335 160
so 0 335 160
as 0 335 160
to 0 335 160
handle 0 335 160
things 0 335 160
properly, 0 335 160
I 0 335 160
personally 0 335 160
gave 0 335 160
a 0 335 160
copy 0 335 160
of 0 335 160
them 0 335 160
to 0 335 160
the 0 335 160
Cardinal 0 335 160
with 0 335 160
an 0 335 160
accompanying 0 335 160
letter 0 335 160
I 0 335 160
had 0 335 160
written. 0 335 160

The 0 335 161
Cardinal 0 335 161
told 0 335 161
me 0 335 161
that 0 335 161
he 0 335 161
knew 0 335 161
nothing 0 335 161
about 0 335 161
it. 0 335 161

However, 1 335 162
he 1 335 162
failed 1 335 162
to 1 335 162
acknowledge 1 335 162
receipt 1 335 162
of 1 335 162
my 1 335 162
two 1 335 162
letters, 1 335 162
contrary 1 335 162
to 1 335 162
what 1 335 162
he 1 335 162
customarily 1 335 162
did. 1 335 162

I 0 335 163
subsequently 0 335 163
learned 0 335 163
that 0 335 163
the 0 335 163
event 0 335 163
at 0 335 163
Georgetown 0 335 163
had 0 335 163
taken 0 335 163
place 0 335 163
for 0 335 163
seven 0 335 163
years. 0 335 163

But 0 335 164
the 0 335 164
Cardinal 0 335 164
knew 0 335 164
nothing 0 335 164
about 0 335 164
it! 0 335 164

Cardinal 0 335 165
Wuerl, 0 335 165
well 0 335 165
aware 0 335 165
of 0 335 165
the 0 335 165
continuous 0 335 165
abuses 0 335 165
committed 0 335 165
by 0 335 165
Cardinal 0 335 165
McCarrick 0 335 165
and 0 335 165
the 0 335 165
sanctions 0 335 165
imposed 0 335 165
on 0 335 165
him 0 335 165
by 0 335 165
Pope 0 335 165
Benedict, 0 335 165
transgressing 0 335 165
the 0 335 165
Pope’s 0 335 165
order, 0 335 165
also 0 335 165
allowed 0 335 165
him 0 335 165
to 0 335 165
reside 0 335 165
at 0 335 165
a 0 335 165
seminary 0 335 165
in 0 335 165
Washington 0 335 165
D.C. 0 335 165

In 0 335 166
doing 0 335 166
so, 0 335 166
he 1 335 166
put 1 335 166
other 1 335 166
seminarians 1 335 166
at 1 335 166
risk. 1 335 166

[emphasis 0 335 167

original] 0 335 167

What 0 335 168
really 0 335 168
concerns 0 335 168
Faggioli 0 335 168
and 0 335 168
those 0 335 168
who 0 335 168
think 0 335 168
like 0 335 168
him 0 335 168
is 0 335 168
not 0 335 168
Wuerl 0 335 168
and 0 335 168
his 0 335 168
“complex 0 335 168
situation,” 0 335 168
which 0 335 168
is 0 335 168
not 0 335 168
complex 0 335 168
at 0 335 168
all. 0 335 168

Rather, 0 335 169
what 0 335 169
he 0 335 169
views 0 335 169
with 0 335 169
alarm 0 335 169
as 0 335 169
an 0 335 169
“essential 0 335 169
element” 0 335 169
of 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
context 0 335 169
in 0 335 169
which 0 335 169
Wuerl 0 335 169
operates 0 335 169
is 0 335 169
that 0 335 169
“scandals 0 335 169
are 0 335 169
also 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
opportunity 0 335 169
for 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
neo-traditionalist 0 335 169
Catholicism 0 335 169
of 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
younger 0 335 169
generations 0 335 169
of 0 335 169
American 0 335 169
Catholics 0 335 169
to 0 335 169
attack 0 335 169
American 0 335 169
bishops 0 335 169
and 0 335 169
cardinals 0 335 169
close 0 335 169
to 0 335 169
Pope 0 335 169
Francis….” 0 335 169
Better 1 335 169
a 1 335 169
thousand 1 335 169
septuagenarian 1 335 169
Wuerls 1 335 169
in 1 335 169
their 1 335 169
lavish 1 335 169
sties 1 335 169
of 1 335 169
corruption, 1 335 169
financed 1 335 169
by 1 335 169
the 1 335 169
faithful, 1 335 169
than 1 335 169
a 1 335 169
single, 1 335 169
young 1 335 169
neo-traditionalist 1 335 169
prelate! 1 335 169

But 0 335 170
what 0 335 170
exactly 0 335 170
is 0 335 170
a 0 335 170
neo-traditionalist? 0 335 170

Quite 0 335 171
simply: 0 335 171
an 1 335 171
orthodox 1 335 171
Catholic 1 335 171
who 1 335 171
has 1 335 171
had 1 335 171
enough 1 335 171
of 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
homosexual-infested 1 335 171
regime 1 335 171
of 1 335 171
novelty 1 335 171
imposed 1 335 171
on 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
Church 1 335 171
by 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
old 1 335 171
men 1 335 171
of 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
Council, 1 335 171
Bergoglio 0 335 171
merely 0 335 171
being 0 335 171
the 0 335 171
latest, 0 335 171
the 0 335 171
highest 0 335 171
placed, 0 335 171
and 0 335 171
one 0 335 171
of 0 335 171
the 0 335 171
last. 0 335 171

As 1 335 172
Faggioli 1 335 172
puts 1 335 172
it: 1 335 172
“In 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
last 1 335 172
fifteen 1 335 172
years, 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
American 1 335 172
Catholic 1 335 172
Church 1 335 172
has 1 335 172
been 1 335 172
traversed 1 335 172
by 1 335 172
a 1 335 172
radicalization 1 335 172
of 1 335 172
religious 1 335 172
conservatism 1 335 172
in 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
neo-traditionalism 1 335 172
sense, 1 335 172
especially 1 335 172
in 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
younger 1 335 172
generations 1 335 172
of 1 335 172
priests 1 335 172
and 1 335 172
intellectuals. 1 335 172

They 1 335 173
interpret 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
current 1 335 173
abuse 1 335 173
crisis 1 335 173
as 1 335 173
fruit 1 335 173
of 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
mistakes 1 335 173
of 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
Council 1 335 173
itself 1 335 173
and 1 335 173
not 1 335 173
only 1 335 173
of 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
post-Council…” 1 335 173

Just 0 335 174
as 0 335 174
Faggioli 0 335 174
fears, 0 335 174
many 0 335 174
in 0 335 174
the 0 335 174
up-and-coming 0 335 174
generation 0 335 174
of 0 335 174
Catholic 0 335 174
clergy 0 335 174
and 0 335 174
laity 0 335 174
recognize 0 335 174
the 0 335 174
obvious: 0 335 174
that 0 335 174
the 0 335 174
conciliar 0 335 174
texts, 0 335 174
for 0 335 174
all 0 335 174
their 0 335 174
prolix 0 335 174
repetition 0 335 174
of 0 335 174
traditional 0 335 174
teaching, 0 335 174
opened 1 335 174
the 1 335 174
way 1 335 174
to 1 335 174
ecclesial 1 335 174
disaster. 1 335 174

Because 0 335 175
in 0 335 175
those 0 335 175
texts—above 0 335 175

Sacrosanctum 0 335 175
Concilium—the 0 335 175

verbally 0 335 175

the 0 335 175
liturgical 0 335 175
Preparatory 0 335 175
Commission 0 335 175
that 0 335 175
drafted 0 335 175
what 0 335 175
would 0 335 175
become 0 335 175
Sacrosanctum 0 335 175
Concilium) 0 335 175
to 0 335 175
begin 0 335 175
demolition 1 335 175
of 1 335 175
the 1 335 175
sacred 1 335 175
liturgy 1 335 175
that 0 335 175
was 0 335 175
the 0 335 175
very 0 335 175
foundation 0 335 175
Catholic 0 335 175
of 0 335 175
orthodoxy 0 335 175
and 0 335 175
orthopraxis. 0 335 175

To 0 335 176
quote 0 335 176
Paul 0 335 176
VI, 0 335 176
then 0 335 176
in 1 335 176
the 1 335 176
depths 1 335 176
of 1 335 176
his 1 335 176
conciliar 1 335 176
delirium 1 335 176
at 0 335 176
the 0 335 176
Council’s 0 335 176
close: 0 335 176

But 0 335 177
one 0 335 177
must 0 335 177
realize 0 335 177
that 0 335 177
this 0 335 177
council, 0 335 177
which 0 335 177
exposed 0 335 177
itself 0 335 177
to 0 335 177
human 0 335 177
judgment, 0 335 177
insisted 0 335 177
very 0 335 177
much 0 335 177
more 0 335 177
upon 0 335 177
this 0 335 177
pleasant 0 335 177
side 0 335 177
of 0 335 177
man, 0 335 177
rather 0 335 177
than 0 335 177
on 0 335 177
his 0 335 177
unpleasant 0 335 177
one. 0 335 177

Its 0 335 178
attitude 0 335 178
was 0 335 178
very 0 335 178
much 0 335 178
and 0 335 178
deliberately 0 335 178
optimistic. 0 335 178

A 0 335 179
wave 1 335 179
of 1 335 179
affection 1 335 179
and 1 335 179
admiration 1 335 179
flowed 1 335 179
from 1 335 179
the 1 335 179
council 1 335 179
over 1 335 179
the 1 335 179
modern 1 335 179
world 1 335 179
of 1 335 179
humanity…. 1 335 179

Instead 0 335 180
of 0 335 180
depressing 0 335 180
diagnoses, 0 335 180
encouraging 0 335 180
remedies; 0 335 180
instead 0 335 180
of 0 335 180
direful 0 335 180
prognostics, 0 335 180
messages 0 335 180
of 0 335 180
trust 0 335 180
issued 0 335 180
from 0 335 180
the 0 335 180
council 0 335 180
to 0 335 180
the 0 335 180
present-day 0 335 180
world. 0 335 180

The 0 335 181
modern 0 335 181
world’s 0 335 181
values 0 335 181
were 0 335 181
not 0 335 181
only 0 335 181
respected 0 335 181
but 0 335 181
honored, 0 335 181
its 0 335 181
efforts 0 335 181
approved, 0 335 181
its 1 335 181
aspirations 1 335 181
purified 1 335 181
and 1 335 181
blessed. 1 335 181

[emphasis 0 335 182
added] 0 335 182

Thus 1 335 183
did 1 335 183
Paul 1 335 183
describe 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
conciliar 1 335 183
“opening 1 335 183
to 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
world” 1 335 183
through 1 335 183
which 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
world 1 335 183
promptly 1 335 183
invaded 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
Church, 1 335 183
including 1 335 183
large 1 335 183
numbers 1 335 183
of 1 335 183
homosexuals 1 335 183
who 1 335 183
should 1 335 183
never 1 335 183
have 1 335 183
been 1 335 183
admitted 1 335 183
to 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
seminary. 1 335 183

In 0 335 184
sum, 0 335 184
Faggioli 0 335 184
is 0 335 184
representative 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
thinking 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
requires 0 335 184
defense 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
a 0 335 184
homosexualized 0 335 184
clergy 0 335 184
if 0 335 184
only 0 335 184
for 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
reason 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
tradition-minded 0 335 184
Catholics 0 335 184
cannot 0 335 184
be 0 335 184
allowed 0 335 184
to 0 335 184
take 0 335 184
their 0 335 184
place: 0 335 184
“This 0 335 184
neo-traditionalist 0 335 184
Catholicism 0 335 184
believes 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
sexual 0 335 184
abuses 0 335 184
are 0 335 184
committed 0 335 184
only 0 335 184
by 0 335 184
homosexual 0 335 184
clergy… 0 335 184
and 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
crisis 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
abuse 0 335 184
can 0 335 184
be 0 335 184
resolved 0 335 184
by 0 335 184
a 0 335 184
kind 0 335 184
of 0 335 184

that 0 335 184

bishops 0 335 184
and 0 335 184
priests 0 335 184
minimally 0 335 184
engaged 0 335 184
in 0 335 184
dialogue 0 335 184
with 0 335 184
modern 0 335 184
culture, 0 335 184
and 0 335 184
replaced 0 335 184
by 0 335 184
a 1 335 184
young 1 335 184
clergy 1 335 184
marked 1 335 184
by 1 335 184
personal 1 335 184
sanctity 1 335 184
but 1 335 184
also 1 335 184
by 1 335 184
a 1 335 184
fascination 1 335 184
for 1 335 184
a 1 335 184
mythical 1 335 184
Middle 1 335 184
Ages 1 335 184
and 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
rejection 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
a 0 335 184
Church-world 0 335 184
relationship 0 335 184
based 0 335 184

a 0 335 184
principle 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
reality.” 0 335 184

Rather 0 335 185
than 0 335 185
“young 1 335 185
clergy 1 335 185
marked 1 335 185

the 0 335 185
neo-Catholic 0 335 185
mentality 0 335 185
Faggioli 0 335 185
exemplifies 0 335 185
prefers 0 335 185
that 0 335 185
homosexual 0 335 185
priests 0 335 185
and 0 335 185
bishops 0 335 185
be 0 335 185
kept 0 335 185
in 0 335 185
place 0 335 185
in 0 335 185
order 0 335 185
to 0 335 185
continue 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
“dialogue 0 335 185
with 0 335 185
modern 0 335 185
culture.” 0 335 185
It 0 335 185
is 0 335 185
not 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
integrity 0 335 185
of 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
Faith 0 335 185
that 0 335 185
matters 0 335 185
but 0 335 185
only 0 335 185
perpetuation 0 335 185
of 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
post-conciliar 0 335 185
regime 0 335 185
of 0 335 185
novelty. 0 335 185

Any 1 335 186
abandonment 1 335 186
of 1 335 186
the 1 335 186
regime 1 335 186
must 1 335 186
be 1 335 186
viewed 1 335 186
as 1 335 186
ecclesiastical 1 335 186
treason—“Catholic 1 335 186
Jacobinism”—if 1 335 186
not 1 335 186
criminal 1 335 186
activity. 1 335 186

Faggioli 0 335 187
would 0 335 187
probably 0 335 187
be 0 335 187
more 0 335 187
inclined 0 335 187
to 0 335 187
civil 0 335 187
or 0 335 187
criminal 0 335 187
prosecution 0 335 187
of 0 335 187
“Catholic 0 335 187
Jacobins” 0 335 187
for 0 335 187
“hate 0 335 187
speech” 0 335 187
than 0 335 187
Novus 0 335 187
Ordo 0 335 187
bishops 0 335 187
for 0 335 187
their 0 335 187
complicity 0 335 187
in 0 335 187
covering 0 335 187
up 0 335 187
homosexual 0 335 187
rapes. 0 335 187

“Homosexuality 1 335 188
in 1 335 188
the 1 335 188
clergy 1 335 188
exists 1 335 188
and 1 335 188
is 1 335 188
a 1 335 188
matter 1 335 188
that 1 335 188
must 1 335 188
be 1 335 188
addressed,” 1 335 188
Faggioli 0 335 188
fleetingly 0 335 188
acknowledges 0 335 188
toward 0 335 188
the 0 335 188
end 0 335 188
of 0 335 188
his 0 335 188
piece, 0 335 188
“but 0 335 188
the 0 335 188
abuse 0 335 188
crisis 0 335 188
cannot 0 335 188
be 0 335 188
resolved 0 335 188
by 0 335 188

scapegoat 0 335 188

scandal 0 335 188
that 0 335 188
has 0 335 188
ancient 0 335 188
roots, 0 335 188
well 0 335 188
before 0 335 188
Vatican 0 335 188
Council 0 335 188
II.” 0 335 188
And 1 335 188
how 1 335 188
does 1 335 188
the 1 335 188
Church 1 335 188
“address” 1 335 188
a 1 335 188
massive 1 335 188
infestation 1 335 188
by 1 335 188
homosexual 1 335 188
priests 1 335 188
and 1 335 188
prelates 1 335 188
without 1 335 188
removing 1 335 188
them 1 335 188
from 1 335 188
authority 1 335 188
and 1 335 188
ensuring 1 335 188
that 1 335 188
they 1 335 188
cannot 1 335 188
promote 1 335 188
homosexual 1 335 188
successors 1 335 188
for 1 335 188
generation 1 335 188
after 1 335 188
generation? 1 335 188

Faggioli 0 335 189
has 0 335 189
no 0 335 189
answer 0 335 189
because 0 335 189
what 1 335 189
he 1 335 189
is 1 335 189
really 1 335 189
arguing—the 1 335 189
final 1 335 189
beachhead 1 335 189
of 1 335 189
the 1 335 189
neo-Catholic 1 335 189
defense 1 335 189
of 1 335 189
their 1 335 189
disintegrating 1 335 189
regime—is 1 335 189
that 1 335 189
homosexuals 1 335 189
in 1 335 189
the 1 335 189
hierarchy 1 335 189
must 1 335 189
remain 1 335 189
in 1 335 189
authority 1 335 189
as 1 335 189
an 1 335 189
indispensable 1 335 189
seawall 1 335 189
against 1 335 189
a 1 335 189
“neo-traditionalist” 1 335 189
storm 1 335 189
surge. 1 335 189

Faggioli’s 1 335 190
argument 1 335 190
demonstrates 1 335 190
that 1 335 190
neo-Catholicism 1 335 190
has 1 335 190
never 1 335 190
been 1 335 190
about 1 335 190
making 1 335 190
the 1 335 190
authentic 1 335 190
Faith 1 335 190
more 1 335 190
appealing 1 335 190
to 1 335 190
a 1 335 190
“modern 1 335 190
world” 1 335 190
founded 1 335 190
precisely 1 335 190
on 1 335 190
a 1 335 190
rejection 1 335 190
of 1 335 190
the 1 335 190
Church’s 1 335 190
authority. 1 335 190

It 1 335 191
is 1 335 191
not 1 335 191
about 1 335 191
the 1 335 191
Faith 1 335 191
at 1 335 191
all. 1 335 191

Rather, 1 335 192
it 1 335 192
is 1 335 192
an 1 335 192
ideological 1 335 192
movement 1 335 192
dedicated 1 335 192
to 1 335 192
the 1 335 192
face-saving 1 335 192
defense 1 335 192
of 1 335 192
a 1 335 192
catastrophic 1 335 192
failure 1 335 192
in 1 335 192
ecclesial 1 335 192
innovation 1 335 192
that 1 335 192
has 1 335 192
corrupted 1 335 192
the 1 335 192
human 1 335 192
element 1 335 192
of 1 335 192
the 1 335 192
Church 1 335 192
in 1 335 192
practically 1 335 192
every 1 335 192
department. 1 335 192

For 0 335 193
people 0 335 193
like 0 335 193
Faggioli, 0 335 193
indeed 0 335 193
for 0 335 193
the 1 335 193
tradition-hating 1 335 193
Pope 1 335 193
they 0 335 193
blindly 0 335 193
defend, 0 335 193
the 0 335 193
one 0 335 193
thing 0 335 193
to 0 335 193
be 0 335 193
feared 0 335 193
is 0 335 193
that 0 335 193
more 1 335 193
and 1 335 193
more 1 335 193
faithful 1 335 193
will 1 335 193
recognize 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
neo-Catholic 1 335 193
polemic 1 335 193
for 1 335 193
what 1 335 193
it 1 335 193
is—a 1 335 193
fraud—and 1 335 193
begin 1 335 193
demanding 1 335 193
a 1 335 193
return 1 335 193
of 1 335 193
everything 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
regime 1 335 193
of 1 335 193
novelty 1 335 193
has 1 335 193
stolen 1 335 193
from 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
life 1 335 193
of 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
Church. 1 335 193

That 1 335 194
is 1 335 194
exactly 1 335 194
what 1 335 194
a 1 335 194
growing 1 335 194
number 1 335 194
of 1 335 194
Catholics 1 335 194
are 1 335 194
now 1 335 194
doing, 1 335 194
as 1 335 194
even 1 335 194
the 1 335 194
secular 1 335 194
press 1 335 194
recognized 1 335 194
less 1 335 194
than 1 335 194
three 1 335 194
months 1 335 194
before 1 335 194
Bergoglio 1 335 194
began 1 335 194
his 1 335 194
tyrannical 1 335 194
reign. 1 335 194

In 0 335 195
this 0 335 195
respect, 0 335 195
what 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
neo-Catholics 0 335 195
are 0 335 195
defending 0 335 195
at 0 335 195
bottom 0 335 195
is 0 335 195
themselves—that 0 335 195
is, 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
reputations 0 335 195
they 0 335 195
have 0 335 195
all 0 335 195
staked 0 335 195
on 0 335 195
their 0 335 195
defense 0 335 195
of 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
indefensible 0 335 195
against 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
traditionalists 0 335 195
they 0 335 195
have 0 335 195
arrogantly 0 335 195
mocked 0 335 195
and 0 335 195
marginalized 0 335 195
for 0 335 195
decades 0 335 195
only 0 335 195
to 0 335 195
see, 0 335 195
to 1 335 195
their 1 335 195
horror, 1 335 195
that 0 335 195
traditionalism 0 335 195
is 0 335 195
ever 0 335 195
more 0 335 195
vindicated 0 335 195
as 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
scandals 0 335 195
of 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
Novus 0 335 195

under 1 335 195
this 1 335 195
reckless 1 335 195
Pope 1 335 195
to 1 335 195
an 1 335 195
unsustainable, 1 335 195
indeed 1 335 195
apocalyptic, 1 335 195
level. 1 335 195

A 0 335 196
return 0 335 196
to 0 335 196
integral 0 335 196
Tradition 0 335 196
is 0 335 196
the 0 335 196
threat 0 335 196
that 0 335 196
Faggioli 0 335 196
sees 0 335 196
as 0 335 196
coming 0 335 196
particularly 0 335 196
from 0 335 196
the 0 335 196
young. 0 335 196

Irony 1 335 197
of 1 335 197
ironies, 1 335 197
he 0 335 197
is 0 335 197
now 0 335 197
reduced 0 335 197
to 0 335 197
defending 0 335 197
what 0 335 197
is 0 335 197
old 0 335 197
and 0 335 197
tired 0 335 197
and 0 335 197
corrupt 0 335 197
against 0 335 197
a 0 335 197
restoration, 0 335 197
led 0 335 197
largely 0 335 197
by 0 335 197
a 1 335 197
youthful 1 335 197
vanguard, 1 335 197
of 1 335 197
what 1 335 197
is 1 335 197
ever 1 335 197
ancient 1 335 197
but 1 335 197
ever 1 335 197
new. 1 335 197

For 0 335 198
some, 0 335 198
it 0 335 198
seems, 0 335 198
no 0 335 198
price 0 335 198
is 0 335 198
too 0 335 198
great—not 0 335 198
even 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
good 0 335 198
of 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
Church—to 0 335 198
avoid 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
personal 0 335 198
ignominy 0 335 198
of 0 335 198
being 0 335 198
seen 0 335 198
on 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
wrong 0 335 198
side 0 335 198
of 0 335 198

Conclusion: 0 335 199
The 0 335 199
Fatima 0 335 199
Connection 0 335 199

Long 0 335 200
before 0 335 200
the 0 335 200
arrival 0 335 200
of 0 335 200
Bergoglio 0 335 200
in 0 335 200
Rome, 0 335 200
the 0 335 200
successive 0 335 200

Sodano 0 335 200
and 0 335 200
Tarcisio 0 335 200
Bertone, 0 335 200
were 0 335 200
instrumental 0 335 200
in 0 335 200
advancing 0 335 200
the 0 335 200
homosexual 0 335 200

As 0 335 201

Bertone 0 335 201
and 0 335 201
Sodano, 0 335 201
Viganò 0 335 201

report 0 335 202
[on 0 335 202

with 0 335 202
all 0 335 202
the 0 335 202
attachments, 0 335 202
was 0 335 202
sent 0 335 202
to 0 335 202
Cardinal 0 335 202
Tarcisio 0 335 202

as 0 335 202
Secretary 0 335 202
of 0 335 202
State. 0 335 202

My 0 335 203
two 0 335 203
above-mentioned 0 335 203
memos 0 335 203
of 0 335 203
December 0 335 203

2006 0 335 203
and 0 335 203
May 0 335 203
25, 0 335 203
2008, 0 335 203
were 0 335 203
also 0 335 203
presumably 0 335 203
handed 0 335 203
over 0 335 203
to 0 335 203
him 0 335 203
by 0 335 203
the 0 335 203
Substitute. 0 335 203

As 0 335 204
already 0 335 204
mentioned, 0 335 204
the 0 335 204
Cardinal 0 335 204
had 0 335 204
no 0 335 204
difficulty 0 335 204
in 0 335 204
insistently 0 335 204

active 1 335 204
homosexuals 1 335 204
— 0 335 204
I 0 335 204
cite 0 335 204
only 0 335 204
the 0 335 204
well-known 0 335 204
case 0 335 204
of 0 335 204
Vincenzo 0 335 204
de 0 335 204
Mauro, 0 335 204
who 0 335 204
was 0 335 204
appointed 0 335 204
Archbishop-Bishop 0 335 204
of 0 335 204
Vigevano 0 335 204
and 0 335 204
later 0 335 204
removed 0 335 204
because 0 335 204
he 0 335 204
was 0 335 204
undermining 0 335 204
his 0 335 204
seminarians 0 335 204
— 0 335 204
and 0 335 204
in 0 335 204
filtering 0 335 204
and 0 335 204
manipulating 0 335 204
the 0 335 204

he 0 335 204
conveyed 0 335 204
to 0 335 204
Pope 0 335 204
Benedict…. 0 335 204

Cardinal 0 335 205
Angelo 0 335 205
Sodano 0 335 205
was 0 335 205
Secretary 0 335 205
of 0 335 205
State 0 335 205
until 0 335 205
September 0 335 205
2006: 0 335 205
all 0 335 205
information 0 335 205
[concerning 0 335 205
McCarrick] 0 335 205
was 0 335 205
communicated 0 335 205
to 0 335 205
him. 0 335 205

In 0 335 206
November 0 335 206
2000, 0 335 206
Nunzio 0 335 206
Montalvo 0 335 206
sent 0 335 206
him 0 335 206
his 0 335 206
report, 0 335 206
passing 0 335 206
on 0 335 206
to 0 335 206
him 0 335 206
the 0 335 206
aforementioned 0 335 206
letter 0 335 206
from 0 335 206
Father 0 335 206
Boniface 0 335 206
Ramsey 0 335 206
in 0 335 206
which 0 335 206
he 0 335 206
denounced 0 335 206
the 0 335 206
serious 0 335 206
abuses 0 335 206
committed 0 335 206
by 0 335 206
McCarrick. 0 335 206

It 0 335 207
is 0 335 207
known 0 335 207
that 0 335 207
Sodano 0 335 207
tried 0 335 207
to 0 335 207
cover 0 335 207
up 0 335 207
the 0 335 207
Father 0 335 207
Maciel 0 335 207
scandal 0 335 207
to 0 335 207
the 0 335 207
end. 0 335 207

He 0 335 208
even 0 335 208
removed 0 335 208
the 0 335 208
Nuncio 0 335 208
in 0 335 208
Mexico 0 335 208
City, 0 335 208
Justo 0 335 208
Mullor, 0 335 208
who 0 335 208
refused 0 335 208
to 0 335 208
be 0 335 208
an 0 335 208
accomplice 0 335 208
in 0 335 208
his 0 335 208
scheme 0 335 208
to 0 335 208
cover 0 335 208
Maciel, 0 335 208
and 0 335 208
in 0 335 208
his 0 335 208
place 0 335 208
appointed 0 335 208
Sandri, 0 335 208
then-Nuncio 0 335 208
to 0 335 208
Venezuela, 0 335 208
who 0 335 208
was 0 335 208
willing 0 335 208
to 0 335 208
collaborate 0 335 208
in 0 335 208
the 0 335 208
cover-up. 0 335 208

Sodano 0 335 209
even 0 335 209
went 0 335 209
so 0 335 209
far 0 335 209
as 0 335 209
to 0 335 209
issue 0 335 209
a 0 335 209
statement 0 335 209
to 0 335 209
the 0 335 209
Vatican 0 335 209
press 0 335 209
office 0 335 209
in 0 335 209
which 0 335 209
a 0 335 209
falsehood 0 335 209
was 0 335 209
affirmed, 0 335 209
that 0 335 209
is, 0 335 209
that 0 335 209
Pope 0 335 209
Benedict 0 335 209
had 0 335 209
decided 0 335 209
that 0 335 209
the 0 335 209
Maciel 0 335 209
case 0 335 209
should 0 335 209
be 0 335 209
considered 0 335 209
closed. 0 335 209

Benedict 0 335 210
reacted, 0 335 210
despite 0 335 210
Sodano’s 0 335 210
strenuous 0 335 210
defense, 0 335 210
and 0 335 210
Maciel 0 335 210
was 0 335 210
found 0 335 210
guilty 0 335 210
and 0 335 210
irrevocably 1 335 210
condemned. 1 335 210

It 0 335 211
is 0 335 211
no 0 335 211
coincidence 0 335 211
that, 0 335 211
as 0 335 211

Fatima, 0 335 211
Sodano 0 335 211
and 0 335 211
Bertone 0 335 211
have 0 335 211
also 0 335 211
taken 0 335 211
the 0 335 211
leading 0 335 211
role 0 335 211
in 0 335 211
suppressing 0 335 211
the 0 335 211
integral 0 335 211

in 0 335 211
general 0 335 211
to 0 335 211
a 0 335 211
generic 0 335 211
prescription 0 335 211
for 0 335 211
personal 0 335 211
piety, 0 335 211
stripped 1 335 211
of 1 335 211
its 1 335 211
prophetic 1 335 211
and 1 335 211
admonitory 1 335 211
content 1 335 211
regarding 1 335 211
the 1 335 211
epochal 1 335 211
malfeasance 1 335 211

Sambi 0 335 214
said, 0 335 214
“Excuse 0 335 214
me.” 0 335 214
He 0 335 214
got 0 335 214
up, 0 335 214

out 0 335 214

“Here,” 0 335 215
he 0 335 215

“Do 0 335 216

“Wait,” 0 335 218
I 0 335 218
said. 0 335 218

“You 1 335 219

Sambi 0 335 219
replied, 0 335 219
“All 0 335 219
I 0 335 219
am 0 335 219

that 0 335 219
there 0 335 219
are 0 335 219

And 0 335 220

we 0 335 220

about 0 335 223
our 0 335 223

at 0 335 223
all 0 335 223

Sodano 0 335 223

to 0 335 223
pass 0 335 223
of 0 335 223
as 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
entirety 0 335 223
of 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
Secret 0 335 223
at 0 335 223
the 0 335 223

corruption 0 335 223
in 0 335 223
high 0 335 223

As 0 335 224
for 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
new 0 335 224
things 0 335 224
which 0 335 224
we 0 335 224
can 0 335 224
find 0 335 224
in 0 335 224
this 0 335 224
message 0 335 224
today, 0 335 224
there 0 335 224
is 0 335 224
also 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
fact 0 335 224
that 0 335 224
attacks 0 335 224
on 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Pope 0 335 224
and 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Church 0 335 224
come 0 335 224
not 0 335 224
only 0 335 224
from 0 335 224
without, 0 335 224
but 0 335 224
the 1 335 224
sufferings 1 335 224
of 1 335 224
the 1 335 224
Church 1 335 224
come 0 335 224
precisely 0 335 224
from 0 335 224
within 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Church, 0 335 224
from 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
sin 0 335 224
existing 0 335 224
within 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Church. 0 335 224

This 0 335 225
too 0 335 225
is 0 335 225
something 0 335 225
that 0 335 225
we 0 335 225
have 0 335 225
always 0 335 225
known, 0 335 225
but 0 335 225
today 0 335 225
we 0 335 225
are 0 335 225
seeing 0 335 225
it 0 335 225
in 0 335 225
a 1 335 225
really 1 335 225
terrifying 1 335 225
way: 1 335 225
that 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
greatest 0 335 225
persecution 0 335 225
of 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
Church 0 335 225
comes 0 335 225
not 0 335 225
from 0 335 225
her 0 335 225
enemies 0 335 225
without, 0 335 225
but 0 335 225
arises 0 335 225
from 0 335 225
sin 0 335 225
within 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
Church, 0 335 225
and 0 335 225
that 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
Church 0 335 225
thus 0 335 225
has 0 335 225
a 1 335 225
deep 1 335 225
need 1 335 225
to 1 335 225
relearn 1 335 225
penance, 1 335 225
to 1 335 225
accept 1 335 225
purification, 1 335 225
to 1 335 225
learn 1 335 225
forgiveness 1 335 225
on 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
one 0 335 225
hand, 0 335 225
but 0 335 225
also 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
need 0 335 225
for 0 335 225
justice. 0 335 225

[emphasis 0 335 226
added] 0 335 226

I 1 335 227
believe 1 335 227
that 1 335 227
Archbishop 1 335 227
Viganò’s 1 335 227
precious 1 335 227
testimony 1 335 227
is 1 335 227
a 1 335 227
sign 1 335 227
that 1 335 227
Heaven 1 335 227
itself 1 335 227
is 1 335 227
now 1 335 227
responding 1 335 227
to 1 335 227
the 1 335 227
“need 1 335 227
for 1 335 227
justice” 1 335 227
in 1 335 227
the 1 335 227
Church. 1 335 227

Whether 0 335 228
or 0 335 228
not 0 335 228
justice 0 335 228
involves 0 335 228
the 0 335 228
resignation 0 335 228
of 0 335 228
the 1 335 228
most 1 335 228
wayward 1 335 228
Pope 1 335 228
in 1 335 228
Church 1 335 228
history, 1 335 228
the 0 335 228
inevitable 0 335 228
season 0 335 228
of 0 335 228
justice 0 335 228
will 0 335 228
culminate 0 335 228
in 1 335 228
the 1 335 228
triumph 1 335 228
of 1 335 228
the 1 335 228
Immaculate 1 335 228
Heart 1 335 228
of 1 335 228
Mary 1 335 228
and 0 335 228
the 0 335 228
Church’s 0 335 228
restoration. 0 335 228

This 0 335 229
will 0 335 229
be 0 335 229
a 0 335 229
final 0 335 229
victory 0 335 229
over 0 335 229
the 0 335 229
enemies 0 335 229
within 0 335 229
and 0 335 229
their 0 335 229
apologists, 0 335 229
such 0 335 229
as 0 335 229
Faggioli, 0 335 229
who, 0 335 229
in 0 335 229
typical 0 335 229
neo-Catholic 0 335 229
style, 0 335 229
imperiously 1 335 229
scoffs 1 335 229
at 0 335 229
the 0 335 229
notion 0 335 229
of 0 335 229
“a 0 335 229
young 1 335 229

marked 1 335 229

personal 1 335 229
sanctity 1 335 229
but 1 335 229
also 1 335 229
by 1 335 229
a 1 335 229
fascination 1 335 229
for 1 335 229

an 1 335 229
unsalvageable 1 335 229
mass 1 335 229
of 1 335 229
corruption 1 335 229
he 0 335 229
dares 0 335 229
to 0 335 229
describe 0 335 229
as 0 335 229
“a 0 335 229
Church-world 1 335 229
relationship 1 335 229
based 1 335 229
on 1 335 229
a 1 335 229
principle 1 335 229
of 1 335 229
reality.” 1 335 229

said 0 350 20
she 0 350 20
ran 0 350 20
from 0 350 20
the 0 350 20
room, 0 350 20
briefly 0 350 20
locked 0 350 20
herself 0 350 20
in 0 350 20
a 0 350 20
bathroom 0 350 20
and 0 350 20
then 0 350 20
fled 0 350 20
the 0 350 20
house. 0 350 20

Do 0 350 21
not 0 350 21
count 0 350 21
me 0 350 21
among 0 350 21
those 0 350 21
who 0 350 21
would 0 350 21
minimize 0 350 21
this 0 350 21
alleged 0 350 21
assault. 0 350 21

I 0 350 22
went 0 350 22
to 0 350 22
a 0 350 22
high 0 350 22
school 0 350 22
that 0 350 22
had 0 350 22
more 0 350 22
than 0 350 22
its 0 350 22
share 0 350 22
of 0 350 22
drunken 0 350 22
parties, 0 350 22
and 0 350 22
my 0 350 22
classmates 0 350 22
could 0 350 22
do 0 350 22
crazy 0 350 22
and 0 350 22
stupid 0 350 22
things, 0 350 22
but 0 350 22
an 0 350 22
act 0 350 22
like 0 350 22
this 0 350 22
was 0 350 22
beyond 0 350 22
the 0 350 22
pale. 0 350 22

This 0 350 23
isn’t 0 350 23
“boys 1 350 23
will 1 350 23
be 1 350 23
boys.” 1 350 23
Actions 0 350 23
have 0 350 23
consequences, 0 350 23
and 0 350 23
it’s 0 350 23
hardly 0 350 23
unjust 0 350 23
to 0 350 23
tell 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
person 0 350 23
that 0 350 23
if 0 350 23
he 0 350 23
mistreated 0 350 23
another 0 350 23
human 0 350 23
being 0 350 23
like 0 350 23
this 0 350 23
— 0 350 23
even 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
long 0 350 23
time 0 350 23
ago 0 350 23
— 0 350 23
he 0 350 23
has 0 350 23
to 0 350 23
remain 0 350 23
“merely” 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
judge 0 350 23
on 0 350 23
the 0 350 23
D.C. 0 350 23

Circuit 0 350 24
Court 0 350 24
of 0 350 24
Appeals. 0 350 24

Since 0 350 25
Kavanaugh 0 350 25
has 0 350 25
denied 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
story, 0 350 25
however, 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
question 0 350 25
of 0 350 25
whether 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
event 0 350 25
is 0 350 25
so 0 350 25
egregious 0 350 25
that 0 350 25
it 0 350 25
should 0 350 25
disqualify 0 350 25
him 0 350 25
is 0 350 25
moot. 0 350 25

At 0 350 26
the 0 350 26
very 0 350 26
least, 0 350 26
if 0 350 26
the 0 350 26
attack 0 350 26
happened, 0 350 26
he 0 350 26
should 0 350 26
be 0 350 26
disqualified 0 350 26
for 0 350 26
lying. 0 350 26

Yet 0 350 27
unless 0 350 27
all 0 350 27
parties 0 350 27
start 0 350 27
telling 0 350 27
the 0 350 27
same 0 350 27
story, 0 350 27
there 0 350 27
is 0 350 27
no 0 350 27
way 0 350 27
to 0 350 27
know 0 350 27
for 0 350 27
certain 0 350 27
if 0 350 27
this 0 350 27
event 0 350 27
occurred. 0 350 27

We 0 350 28
don’t 0 350 28
need 0 350 28
certainty, 0 350 28
however, 0 350 28
to 0 350 28
make 0 350 28
a 0 350 28
decision 0 350 28
on 0 350 28
whether 0 350 28
a 0 350 28
man 0 350 28
should 0 350 28
sit 0 350 28
on 0 350 28
the 0 350 28
Supreme 0 350 28
Court. 0 350 28

I 0 350 29
have 0 350 29
the 0 350 29
same 0 350 29
standard 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Brett 0 350 29
Kavanaugh 0 350 29
as 0 350 29
I 0 350 29
did 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Roy 0 350 29
Moore, 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Donald 0 350 29
Trump, 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Bill 0 350 29
Clinton 0 350 29
— 0 350 29
or 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
any 0 350 29
other 0 350 29
politician 0 350 29
who’s 0 350 29
accused 0 350 29
of 0 350 29
misconduct. 0 350 29

Is 0 350 30
it 0 350 30
more 0 350 30
likely 0 350 30
than 0 350 30
not 0 350 30
that 0 350 30
the 0 350 30
allegation 0 350 30
is 0 350 30
true? 0 350 30

Given 0 350 31
the 0 350 31
totality 0 350 31
of 0 350 31
the 0 350 31
evidence, 0 350 31
I 0 350 31
believe 0 350 31
it 0 350 31
is 0 350 31
more 0 350 31
likely 0 350 31
than 0 350 31
not 0 350 31
that 0 350 31
Bill 0 350 31
Clinton 0 350 31
committed 0 350 31
rape 0 350 31
and 0 350 31
sexual 0 350 31
harassment. 0 350 31

I 0 350 32
believe 0 350 32
it 0 350 32
is 0 350 32
more 0 350 32
likely 0 350 32
than 0 350 32
not 0 350 32
that 0 350 32
Donald 0 350 32
Trump 0 350 32
has 0 350 32
committed 0 350 32
sexual 0 350 32
assault. 0 350 32

I 0 350 33
believe 0 350 33
it 0 350 33
is 0 350 33
more 0 350 33
likely 0 350 33
than 0 350 33
not 0 350 33
that 0 350 33
Roy 0 350 33
Moore 0 350 33
engaged 0 350 33
in 0 350 33
sexual 0 350 33
misconduct 0 350 33
with 0 350 33
underage 0 350 33
girls. 0 350 33

But 0 350 34
the 0 350 34
evidence 0 350 34
against 0 350 34
Kavanaugh 0 350 34
falls 0 350 34
far 0 350 34
short 0 350 34
of 0 350 34
the 0 350 34
evidence 0 350 34
arrayed 0 350 34
against 0 350 34
each 0 350 34
of 0 350 34
these 0 350 34
men. 0 350 34

So 0 350 35
far 0 350 35
at 0 350 35
least 0 350 35
it 1 350 35
falls 1 350 35
far 1 350 35
short 1 350 35
of 1 350 35
the 1 350 35
evidence 1 350 35
against 1 350 35
virtually 1 350 35
any 1 350 35
other 1 350 35
politician 1 350 35
or 1 350 35
celebrity 1 350 35
who 1 350 35
has 1 350 35
faced 1 350 35
consequences 1 350 35
during 0 350 35
this 0 350 35
#MeToo 0 350 35
moment. 0 350 35

Here’s 0 350 36
why: 0 350 36

First, 0 350 37
one 0 350 37
way 0 350 37
to 0 350 37
help 0 350 37
test 0 350 37
the 0 350 37
veracity 0 350 37
of 0 350 37
old 0 350 37
claims 0 350 37
is 0 350 37
to 0 350 37
ask 0 350 37
whether 0 350 37
there 0 350 37
is 0 350 37
any 0 350 37
contemporaneous 0 350 37
corroboration. 0 350 37

Did 0 350 38
the 0 350 38
accuser 0 350 38
tell 0 350 38
a 0 350 38
friend 0 350 38
or 0 350 38
family 0 350 38
member 0 350 38
or 0 350 38
anyone 0 350 38
about 0 350 38
the 0 350 38
alleged 0 350 38
assault 0 350 38
when 0 350 38
it 0 350 38
occurred? 0 350 38

With 0 350 39
Clinton, 0 350 39
Trump, 0 350 39
Moore, 0 350 39
and 0 350 39
many 0 350 39
other 0 350 39
politicians 0 350 39
and 0 350 39
celebrities, 0 350 39
there 0 350 39
was 0 350 39
ample 0 350 39
contemporaneous 0 350 39
corroboration. 0 350 39

Here, 0 350 40
there 0 350 40
was 0 350 40
not. 0 350 40

According 0 350 41
to 0 350 41
the 0 350 41
Washington 0 350 41
Post, 0 350 41
“Ford 0 350 41
said 0 350 41
she 0 350 41
told 0 350 41
no 0 350 41
one 0 350 41
of 0 350 41
the 0 350 41
incident 0 350 41
in 0 350 41
any 0 350 41
detail 0 350 41
until 0 350 41
2012, 0 350 41
when 0 350 41
she 0 350 41
was 0 350 41
in 0 350 41
couples 0 350 41
therapy 0 350 41
with 0 350 41
her 0 350 41
husband.” 0 350 41

That’s 0 350 42
almost 0 350 42
three 0 350 42
decades 0 350 42
of 0 350 42
silence 0 350 42
— 0 350 42
three 0 350 42
decades 0 350 42
when 0 350 42
memories 0 350 42
can 0 350 42
grow 0 350 42
cloudy 0 350 42
and 0 350 42
recollections 0 350 42
can 0 350 42
change. 0 350 42

But 0 350 43
even 0 350 43
the 0 350 43
allegedly 0 350 43
corroborating 0 350 43
notes 0 350 43
of 0 350 43
the 0 350 43
therapist 0 350 43
raise 0 350 43
a 0 350 43
separate 0 350 43
problem. 0 350 43

They 0 350 44
actually 0 350 44
contradict 0 350 44
her 0 350 44
story 0 350 44
on 0 350 44
a 0 350 44
key 0 350 44
detail. 0 350 44

According 0 350 45
to 0 350 45
the 0 350 45
Post, 0 350 45
“The 0 350 45
notes 0 350 45
say 0 350 45
four 0 350 45
boys 0 350 45
were 0 350 45
involved, 0 350 45
a 0 350 45
discrepancy 0 350 45
that 0 350 45
Ford 0 350 45
says 0 350 45
was 0 350 45
an 0 350 45
error 0 350 45
on 0 350 45
the 0 350 45
therapist’s 0 350 45
part. 0 350 45

Ford 0 350 46
said 0 350 46
there 0 350 46
were 0 350 46
four 0 350 46
boys 0 350 46
at 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
party 0 350 46
but 0 350 46
only 0 350 46
two 0 350 46
in 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
room.” 0 350 46
Nor 0 350 46
do 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
notes 0 350 46
mention 0 350 46
Kavanaugh’s 0 350 46
name, 0 350 46
even 0 350 46
though 0 350 46
her 0 350 46
husband 0 350 46
says 0 350 46
Ford 0 350 46
named 0 350 46
Kavanaugh 0 350 46
in 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
sessions. 0 350 46

Those 0 350 47
are 0 350 47
important 0 350 47
discrepancies, 0 350 47
and 1 350 47
if 1 350 47
six 1 350 47
years 1 350 47
ago 1 350 47
she 1 350 47
told 1 350 47
the 1 350 47
therapist 1 350 47
four 1 350 47
men 1 350 47
and 1 350 47
says 1 350 47
two 1 350 47
men 1 350 47
now, 1 350 47
that 1 350 47
suggests 1 350 47
that 1 350 47
her 1 350 47
memory 1 350 47
of 1 350 47
the 1 350 47
event 1 350 47
may 1 350 47
be 1 350 47
suspect. 1 350 47

As 0 350 48
a 0 350 48
former 0 350 48
trial 0 350 48
lawyer, 0 350 48
I 1 350 48
can 1 350 48
tell 1 350 48
you 1 350 48
that 1 350 48
while 1 350 48
neither 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
nor 1 350 48
memories 1 350 48
are 1 350 48
infallible, 1 350 48
in 1 350 48
a 1 350 48
contest 1 350 48
between 1 350 48
contemporaneous 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
and 1 350 48
later 1 350 48
verbal 1 350 48
testimony 1 350 48
about 1 350 48
those 1 350 48
notes, 1 350 48
the 1 350 48
content 1 350 48
of 1 350 48
the 1 350 48
written 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
usually 1 350 48
prevails. 1 350 48

Juries 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
extremely 1 350 49
skeptical 1 350 49
of 0 350 49
witnesses 0 350 49
who 0 350 49
contradict 0 350 49
written 0 350 49
notes 0 350 49
— 0 350 49
after 0 350 49
all, 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
notes 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
taken 0 350 49
when 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
words 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
immediate 0 350 49
and 0 350 49
there 0 350 49
isn’t 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
overwhelming 0 350 49
pressure 0 350 49
of 0 350 49
a 0 350 49
trial 0 350 49
to 0 350 49
conform 0 350 49
your 0 350 49
testimony 0 350 49
to 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
desired 0 350 49
outcome. 0 350 49

At 0 350 50
least 0 350 50
the 0 350 50
investigation 0 350 50
seems 0 350 50
somewhat 0 350 50
manageable. 0 350 50

If 0 350 51
there 0 350 51
were 0 350 51
only 0 350 51
four 0 350 51
boys 0 350 51
there, 0 350 51
who 0 350 51
were 0 350 51
the 0 350 51
other 0 350 51
two? 0 350 51

Let’s 0 350 52
hear 0 350 52
from 0 350 52
them. 0 350 52

In 0 350 53
fact, 0 350 53
investigators 0 350 53
should 0 350 53
interview 0 350 53
everyone 0 350 53
else 0 350 53
at 0 350 53
the 0 350 53
party. 0 350 53

Yet 0 350 54
given 0 350 54
all 0 350 54
the 0 350 54
years 0 350 54
that 0 350 54
have 0 350 54
passed, 0 350 54
would 0 350 54
it 0 350 54
be 0 350 54
possible 0 350 54
to 0 350 54
find 0 350 54
anyone 0 350 54
who 0 350 54
remembers 0 350 54
being 0 350 54
at 0 350 54

as 0 371 3
they 0 371 3
say, 0 371 3
doubled 0 371 3
down. 0 371 3

Far 0 371 4
from 0 371 4
backing-away 0 371 4
and 0 371 4
making 0 371 4
excuses 0 371 4
for 0 371 4
his 0 371 4
early 0 371 4
actions, 0 371 4
as 0 371 4
we’ve 0 371 4
all 0 371 4
become 0 371 4
so 0 371 4
accustomed 0 371 4
to 0 371 4
seeing 0 371 4
in 0 371 4
these 0 371 4
rare 0 371 4
cases 0 371 4
where 0 371 4
a 0 371 4
hierarch 0 371 4
breaks 0 371 4
ranks, 0 371 4
Archbishop 0 371 4
Viganò 0 371 4
is 0 371 4
digging 0 371 4
in 0 371 4
with 0 371 4
a 1 371 4
4-page 1 371 4
bombshell 1 371 4
that 0 371 4
restates 0 371 4
his 0 371 4
initial 0 371 4
accusations 0 371 4
of 0 371 4
abuse 0 371 4
cover-up 0 371 4
against 0 371 4

powerful 0 371 4
members 0 371 4
of 0 371 4
the 0 371 4

and 0 371 4
even 0 371 4
concludes 0 371 4
with 0 371 4
a 0 371 4
suggestion 0 371 4
that 0 371 4
Francis 0 371 4
is 0 371 4
beginning 0 371 4
to 0 371 4
act 0 371 4
as 0 371 4
a 1 371 4
“substitute 1 371 4
of 1 371 4
our 1 371 4
Lord.” 1 371 4

Read 0 371 5
the 0 371 5
Archbishop’s 0 371 5
words 0 371 5
for 0 371 5
yourselves 0 371 5
and 0 371 5
note 0 371 5
well 0 371 5
the 0 371 5
ring 0 371 5
of 0 371 5
truth 0 371 5
that 0 371 5
resonates 0 371 5
in 0 371 5
every 0 371 5
sentence. 0 371 5

This 1 371 6
is 1 371 6
clearly 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
testimony 1 371 6
of 1 371 6
an 1 371 6
honest 1 371 6
man 1 371 6
who 1 371 6
has 1 371 6
only 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
good 1 371 6
of 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
Church 1 371 6
in 1 371 6
his 1 371 6
heart—a 1 371 6
modern-day 1 371 6
Athanasius 1 371 6
standing 1 371 6
against 1 371 6
something 1 371 6
so 1 371 6
much 1 371 6
worse 1 371 6
than 1 371 6
Liberius. 1 371 6

Friends, 0 371 7
let 0 371 7
us 0 371 7
pray 0 371 7
for 0 371 7
Archbishop 0 371 7
Viganò. 0 371 7

He 0 371 8
is 0 371 8
standing 0 371 8
alone 0 371 8
now, 0 371 8
and 0 371 8
not 0 371 8
only 0 371 8
against 0 371 8
the 1 371 8
most 1 371 8
dangerous 1 371 8
pontificate 1 371 8
in 1 371 8
history, 1 371 8
but 0 371 8
also 0 371 8
the 1 371 8
forces 1 371 8
of 1 371 8
hell 1 371 8
itself—forces 0 371 8
which 0 371 8
will 0 371 8
do 0 371 8
all 0 371 8
in 0 371 8
their 0 371 8
power 0 371 8
to 0 371 8
silence 0 371 8
this 0 371 8
voice 1 371 8
crying 1 371 8
in 1 371 8
the 1 371 8
wilderness. 1 371 8

Make 0 371 9
no 0 371 9
mistake 0 371 9
about 0 371 9
this: 0 371 9
Archbishop 1 371 9
Viganò 1 371 9
is 1 371 9
fighting 1 371 9
for 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
very 1 371 9
survival 1 371 9
of 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
human 1 371 9
element 1 371 9
of 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
Catholic 1 371 9
Church. 1 371 9

He 0 371 10
is 0 371 10
standing 0 371 10
against 0 371 10
corrupt 0 371 10
men 0 371 10
in 0 371 10
high 0 371 10
places 0 371 10
who 0 371 10
cannot 0 371 10
be 0 371 10
trusted 0 371 10
to 0 371 10
do 0 371 10
what 0 371 10
is 0 371 10
best 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
souls, 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
the 0 371 10
Catholic 0 371 10
faithful 0 371 10
or 0 371 10
indeed 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
Holy 0 371 10
Mother 0 371 10
Church 0 371 10
herself. 0 371 10

The 1 371 11
enemy 1 371 11
is 1 371 11
not 1 371 11
only 1 371 11
at 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
gates 1 371 11
but 1 371 11
has 1 371 11
now 1 371 11
made 1 371 11
their 1 371 11
way 1 371 11
to 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
thrones 1 371 11
of 1 371 11
power 1 371 11
and 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
seats 1 371 11
of 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
Apostles. 1 371 11

God 1 371 12
help 1 371 12
us. 1 371 12

It 0 371 13
goes 0 371 13
without 0 371 13
saying 0 371 13
that 0 371 13
we 0 371 13
here 0 371 13
at 0 371 13
The 0 371 13
Remnant 0 371 13

Viganò 0 371 13
but 0 371 13
we 0 371 13
thank 0 371 13
God 0 371 13
for 0 371 13
him 0 371 13
every 0 371 13
day, 0 371 13
we 0 371 13
pray 0 371 13
the 0 371 13
Rosary 0 371 13
for 0 371 13
him 0 371 13
every 0 371 13

and 0 371 13
wish 1 371 13
him 1 371 13
every 1 371 13
blessing 1 371 13
and 1 371 13
heavenly 1 371 13
consolation 1 371 13
as 1 371 13
he 1 371 13
undergoes 1 371 13
this 1 371 13
passion 1 371 13
for 1 371 13
the 1 371 13
sake 1 371 13
of 1 371 13
the 1 371 13
Master 1 371 13
he 1 371 13
serves 1 371 13
so 1 371 13
well. 1 371 13

God 0 371 14
bless 0 371 14
you, 0 371 14
Your 0 371 14
Excellency, 0 371 14
and 0 371 14
Mary 0 371 14
keep 0 371 14
you. 0 371 14

prevented 0 371 36

increasingly 0 371 36
indefensible, 0 371 36

order 0 371 37
to 0 371 37
protect 0 371 37
the 0 371 37
Church, 0 371 37
and 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
declare 0 371 37
with 0 371 37
a 0 371 37
clear 0 371 37
conscience 0 371 37
before 0 371 37
God 0 371 37
that 0 371 37
my 0 371 37
testimony 0 371 37
is 0 371 37
true. 0 371 37

Christ 0 371 38
died 0 371 38
for 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
Church, 0 371 38
and 0 371 38
Peter, 0 371 38
Servus 0 371 38
servorum 0 371 38
Dei, 0 371 38
is 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
first 0 371 38
one 0 371 38
called 0 371 38
to 0 371 38
serve 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
spouse 0 371 38
of 0 371 38
Christ. 0 371 38

Certainly, 0 371 39
some 0 371 39
of 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
facts 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
was 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
reveal 0 371 39
were 0 371 39
covered 0 371 39
by 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
pontifical 0 371 39
secret 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
had 0 371 39
promised 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
observe 0 371 39
and 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
had 0 371 39
faithfully 0 371 39
observed 0 371 39
from 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
beginning 0 371 39
of 0 371 39
my 0 371 39
service 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
Holy 0 371 39
See. 0 371 39

But 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
purpose 0 371 40
of 0 371 40
any 0 371 40
secret, 0 371 40
including 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
pontifical 0 371 40
secret, 0 371 40
is 0 371 40
to 0 371 40
protect 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
Church 0 371 40
from 0 371 40
her 0 371 40
enemies, 0 371 40
not 0 371 40
to 0 371 40
cover 0 371 40
up 0 371 40
and 0 371 40
become 0 371 40
complicit 0 371 40
in 0 371 40
crimes 0 371 40
committed 0 371 40
by 0 371 40
some 0 371 40
of 0 371 40
her 0 371 40
members. 0 371 40

I 0 371 41
was 0 371 41
a 0 371 41
witness, 0 371 41
not 0 371 41
by 0 371 41
my 0 371 41
choice, 0 371 41
of 0 371 41
shocking 1 371 41
facts 1 371 41
and, 0 371 41
as 0 371 41
the 0 371 41
Catechism 0 371 41
of 0 371 41
the 0 371 41
Catholic 0 371 41
Church 0 371 41
states 0 371 41
(par. 0 371 41

2491), 0 371 42
the 0 371 42
seal 0 371 42
of 0 371 42
secrecy 0 371 42
is 0 371 42
not 0 371 42
binding 0 371 42
when 0 371 42
very 0 371 42
grave 0 371 42
harm 0 371 42
can 0 371 42
be 0 371 42
avoided 0 371 42
only 0 371 42
by 0 371 42
divulging 0 371 42
the 0 371 42
truth. 0 371 42

Only 0 371 43
the 0 371 43
seal 0 371 43
of 0 371 43
confession 0 371 43
could 0 371 43
have 0 371 43
justified 0 371 43
my 0 371 43
silence. 0 371 43

Neither 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
pope, 0 371 44
nor 0 371 44
any 0 371 44
of 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
cardinals 0 371 44
in 0 371 44
Rome 0 371 44
have 0 371 44
denied 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
facts 0 371 44
I 0 371 44
asserted 0 371 44
in 0 371 44
my 0 371 44
testimony. 0 371 44

“Qui 0 371 45
tacet 0 371 45
consentit” 0 371 45
surely 0 371 45
applies 0 371 45
here, 0 371 45
for 0 371 45
if 0 371 45
they 0 371 45
deny 0 371 45
my 0 371 45
testimony, 0 371 45
they 0 371 45
have 0 371 45
only 0 371 45
to 0 371 45
say 0 371 45
so, 0 371 45
and 0 371 45
provide 0 371 45
documentation 0 371 45
to 0 371 45
support 0 371 45
that 0 371 45
denial. 0 371 45

How 1 371 46
can 1 371 46
one 1 371 46
avoid 1 371 46
concluding 1 371 46
that 1 371 46
the 1 371 46
reason 1 371 46
they 1 371 46
do 1 371 46
not 1 371 46
provide 1 371 46
the 1 371 46
documentation 1 371 46
is 1 371 46
that 1 371 46
they 1 371 46
know 1 371 46
it 1 371 46
confirms 1 371 46
my 1 371 46
testimony? 1 371 46

The 0 371 47
center 0 371 47
of 0 371 47
my 0 371 47
testimony 0 371 47
was 0 371 47
that 0 371 47
since 0 371 47
at 0 371 47
least 0 371 47
June 0 371 47
23, 0 371 47
2013, 0 371 47
the 0 371 47
pope 0 371 47
knew 0 371 47
from 0 371 47
me 0 371 47
how 1 371 47
perverse 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
evil 1 371 47
McCarrick 0 371 47
was 0 371 47
in 0 371 47
his 0 371 47
intentions 0 371 47
and 0 371 47
actions, 0 371 47
and 0 371 47
instead 1 371 47
of 1 371 47
taking 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
measures 1 371 47
that 1 371 47
every 1 371 47
good 1 371 47
pastor 1 371 47
would 1 371 47
have 1 371 47
taken, 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
pope 1 371 47
made 1 371 47
McCarrick 1 371 47
one 1 371 47
of 1 371 47
his 1 371 47
principal 1 371 47
agents 1 371 47
in 1 371 47
governing 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
Church, 1 371 47
in 1 371 47
regard 1 371 47
to 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
United 1 371 47
States, 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
Curia, 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
even 1 371 47
China, 1 371 47
as 1 371 47
we 1 371 47
are 1 371 47
seeing 1 371 47
these 1 371 47
days 1 371 47
with 1 371 47
great 1 371 47
concern 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
anxiety 1 371 47
for 1 371 47
that 1 371 47
martyr 1 371 47
Church. 1 371 47

Now, 1 371 48
the 1 371 48
pope’s 1 371 48
reply 1 371 48
to 1 371 48
my 1 371 48
testimony 1 371 48
was: 1 371 48
“I 1 371 48
will 1 371 48
not 1 371 48
say 1 371 48
a 1 371 48
word!” 1 371 48
But 1 371 48
then, 1 371 48
contradicting 1 371 48
himself, 1 371 48
he 1 371 48
has 1 371 48
compared 1 371 48
his 1 371 48
silence 1 371 48
to 1 371 48
that 1 371 48
of 1 371 48
Jesus 1 371 48
in 1 371 48
Nazareth 1 371 48
and 1 371 48
before 1 371 48
Pilate, 1 371 48
and 0 371 48
compared 0 371 48
me 0 371 48
to 0 371 48
the 1 371 48
great 1 371 48
accuser, 1 371 48
Satan, 1 371 48
who 1 371 48
sows 1 371 48
scandal 1 371 48
and 1 371 48
division 1 371 48
in 1 371 48
the 1 371 48
Church 1 371 48
— 0 371 48
though 0 371 48
without 0 371 48
ever 0 371 48
uttering 0 371 48
my 0 371 48
name. 0 371 48

If 0 371 49
he 0 371 49
had 0 371 49
said: 0 371 49
“Viganò 0 371 49
lied,” 0 371 49
he 0 371 49
would 0 371 49
have 0 371 49
challenged 0 371 49
my 0 371 49
credibility 0 371 49
while 0 371 49
trying 0 371 49
to 0 371 49
affirm 0 371 49
his 0 371 49
own. 0 371 49

In 0 371 50
so 0 371 50
doing 0 371 50
he 0 371 50
would 0 371 50
have 0 371 50
intensified 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
demand 0 371 50
of 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
people 0 371 50
of 0 371 50
God 0 371 50
and 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
world 0 371 50
for 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
documentation 0 371 50
needed 0 371 50
to 0 371 50
determine 0 371 50
who 0 371 50
has 0 371 50
told 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
truth. 0 371 50

Instead, 0 371 51
he 0 371 51
put 0 371 51
in 0 371 51
place 0 371 51
a 0 371 51
subtle 0 371 51
slander 0 371 51
against 0 371 51
me 0 371 51
— 0 371 51
slander 0 371 51
being 0 371 51
an 0 371 51
offense 0 371 51
he 0 371 51
has 0 371 51
often 0 371 51
compared 0 371 51
to 0 371 51
the 0 371 51
gravity 0 371 51
of 0 371 51
murder. 0 371 51

Indeed, 0 371 52
he 0 371 52
did 0 371 52
it 0 371 52
repeatedly, 0 371 52
in 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
context 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
celebration 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
most 0 371 52
Holy 0 371 52
Sacrament, 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
Eucharist, 0 371 52
where 0 371 52
he 0 371 52
runs 0 371 52
no 0 371 52
risk 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
being 0 371 52
challenged 0 371 52
by 0 371 52
journalists. 0 371 52

When 0 371 53
he 0 371 53
did 0 371 53
speak 0 371 53
to 0 371 53
journalists, 0 371 53
he 0 371 53
asked 0 371 53
them 0 371 53
to 0 371 53
exercise 0 371 53
their 0 371 53
professional 0 371 53
maturity 0 371 53
and 0 371 53
draw 0 371 53
their 0 371 53
own 0 371 53
conclusions. 0 371 53

But 1 371 54
how 1 371 54
can 1 371 54
journalists 1 371 54
discover 1 371 54
and 1 371 54
know 1 371 54
the 1 371 54
truth 1 371 54
if 1 371 54
those 1 371 54
directly 1 371 54
involved 1 371 54
with 1 371 54
a 1 371 54
matter 1 371 54
refuse 1 371 54
to 1 371 54
answer 1 371 54
any 1 371 54
questions 1 371 54
or 1 371 54
to 1 371 54
release 1 371 54
any 1 371 54
documents? 1 371 54

The 1 371 55
pope’s 1 371 55
unwillingness 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
respond 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
my 1 371 55
charges 1 371 55
and 1 371 55
his 1 371 55
deafness 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
the 1 371 55
appeals 1 371 55
by 1 371 55
the 1 371 55
faithful 1 371 55
for 1 371 55
accountability 1 371 55
are 1 371 55
hardly 1 371 55
consistent 1 371 55
with 1 371 55
his 1 371 55
calls 1 371 55
for 1 371 55
transparency 1 371 55
and 1 371 55
bridge 1 371 55
building. 1 371 55

Moreover, 0 371 56
the 0 371 56
pope’s 0 371 56
cover-up 0 371 56
of 0 371 56
McCarrick 0 371 56
was 0 371 56
clearly 0 371 56
not 0 371 56
an 0 371 56
isolated 0 371 56
mistake. 0 371 56

Many 1 371 57
more 1 371 57
instances 1 371 57
have 1 371 57
recently 1 371 57
been 1 371 57
documented 1 371 57
in 1 371 57
the 1 371 57
press, 1 371 57
showing 1 371 57
that 1 371 57
Pope 1 371 57
Francis 1 371 57
has 1 371 57
defended 1 371 57
homosexual 1 371 57
clergy 1 371 57
who 1 371 57
committed 1 371 57
serious 1 371 57
sexual 1 371 57
abuses 1 371 57
against 1 371 57
minors 1 371 57
or 1 371 57
adults. 1 371 57

These 0 371 58
include 0 371 58
his 0 371 58
role 0 371 58
in 0 371 58
the 0 371 58
case 0 371 58
of 0 371 58
Fr. 0 371 58

Julio 0 371 59
Grassi 0 371 59
in 0 371 59
Buenos 0 371 59
Aires, 0 371 59
his 0 371 59
reinstatement 0 371 59
of 0 371 59
Fr. 0 371 59

Mauro 0 371 60
Inzoli 0 371 60
after 0 371 60
Pope 0 371 60
Benedict 0 371 60
had 0 371 60
removed 0 371 60
him 0 371 60
from 0 371 60
ministry 0 371 60
(until 0 371 60
he 0 371 60
went 0 371 60
to 0 371 60
prison, 0 371 60
at 0 371 60
which 0 371 60
point 0 371 60
Pope 0 371 60
Francis 0 371 60
laicized 0 371 60
him), 0 371 60
and 0 371 60
his 0 371 60
halting 0 371 60
of 0 371 60
the 0 371 60

of 0 371 60

In 0 371 61
the 0 371 61
meantime, 0 371 61
a 0 371 61
delegation 0 371 61
of 0 371 61

by 0 371 61
its 0 371 61
president 0 371 61
Cardinal 0 371 61
DiNardo, 0 371 61
went 0 371 61
to 0 371 61
Rome 0 371 61
asking 0 371 61
for 0 371 61
a 0 371 61

investigation 0 371 61
into 0 371 61
McCarrick. 0 371 61

Cardinal 0 371 62
DiNardo 0 371 62
and 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
other 0 371 62
prelates 0 371 62
should 0 371 62
tell 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
Church 0 371 62
in 0 371 62
America 0 371 62
and 0 371 62
in 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
world: 0 371 62
did 1 371 62
the 1 371 62
pope 1 371 62
refuse 1 371 62
to 1 371 62
carry 1 371 62
out 1 371 62
a 1 371 62
Vatican 1 371 62
investigation 1 371 62
into 1 371 62
McCarrick’s 1 371 62
crimes 1 371 62
and 1 371 62
of 1 371 62
those 1 371 62
responsible 1 371 62
for 1 371 62
covering 1 371 62
them 1 371 62
up? 1 371 62

The 1 371 63
faithful 1 371 63
deserve 1 371 63
to 1 371 63
know. 1 371 63

I 0 371 64
would 0 371 64
like 0 371 64
to 0 371 64
make 0 371 64
a 0 371 64
special 0 371 64
appeal 0 371 64
to 0 371 64
Cardinal 0 371 64
Ouellet, 0 371 64
because 0 371 64
as 0 371 64
nuncio 0 371 64
I 0 371 64
always 0 371 64
worked 0 371 64
in 0 371 64
great 0 371 64
harmony 0 371 64
with 0 371 64
him, 0 371 64
and 0 371 64
I 0 371 64
have 0 371 64
always 0 371 64
had 0 371 64
great 0 371 64
esteem 0 371 64
and 0 371 64
affection 0 371 64
towards 0 371 64
him. 0 371 64

He 0 371 65
will 0 371 65
remember 0 371 65
when, 0 371 65
at 0 371 65
the 0 371 65
end 0 371 65
of 0 371 65
my 0 371 65
mission 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
Washington, 0 371 65
he 0 371 65
received 0 371 65
me 0 371 65
at 0 371 65
his 0 371 65
apartment 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
Rome 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
the 0 371 65
evening 0 371 65
for 0 371 65
a 0 371 65
long 0 371 65
conversation. 0 371 65

At 0 371 66
the 0 371 66
beginning 0 371 66
of 0 371 66
Pope 0 371 66
Francis’ 0 371 66
pontificate, 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
had 0 371 66
maintained 0 371 66
his 0 371 66
dignity, 0 371 66
as 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
had 0 371 66
shown 0 371 66
with 0 371 66
courage 0 371 66
when 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
was 0 371 66
Archbishop 0 371 66
of 0 371 66
Québec. 0 371 66

Later, 0 371 67
however, 0 371 67
when 0 371 67
his 0 371 67
work 0 371 67
as 0 371 67
prefect 0 371 67
of 0 371 67
the 0 371 67
Congregation 0 371 67
for 0 371 67
Bishops 0 371 67
was 0 371 67
being 0 371 67
undermined 0 371 67
because 0 371 67
recommendations 0 371 67
for 0 371 67
episcopal 0 371 67
appointments 0 371 67
were 0 371 67
being 0 371 67
passed 0 371 67
directly 0 371 67
to 0 371 67
Pope 0 371 67
Francis 0 371 67
by 0 371 67
two 1 371 67
homosexual 1 371 67
“friends” 1 371 67
of 1 371 67
his 1 371 67
dicastery, 1 371 67
bypassing 0 371 67
the 0 371 67
Cardinal, 0 371 67
he 0 371 67
gave 0 371 67
up. 0 371 67

His 1 371 68
long 1 371 68
article 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
L’Osservatore 1 371 68
Romano, 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
which 1 371 68
he 1 371 68
came 1 371 68
out 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
favor 1 371 68
of 1 371 68
the 1 371 68
more 1 371 68
controversial 1 371 68
aspects 1 371 68
of 1 371 68

Your 0 371 69
Eminence, 0 371 69
before 0 371 69
I 0 371 69
left 0 371 69
for 0 371 69
Washington, 0 371 69
you 0 371 69
were 0 371 69
the 0 371 69
one 0 371 69

told 0 371 69
me 0 371 69
of 0 371 69
Pope 0 371 69
Benedict’s 0 371 69
sanctions 0 371 69
on 0 371 69
McCarrick. 0 371 69

You 0 371 70

key 0 371 70

incriminating 0 371 70
McCarrick 0 371 70
and 0 371 70
many 0 371 70
in 0 371 70
the 0 371 70
curia 0 371 70
for 0 371 70
their 0 371 70
cover-ups. 0 371 70

Your 0 371 71
Eminence, 0 371 71
I 0 371 71
urge 0 371 71
you 0 371 71

***** 0 371 72

Finally, 0 371 73
I 1 371 73
wish 1 371 73

Dina 0 380 4
Habib 0 380 4
Powell 0 380 4
was 0 380 4
an 0 380 4
influential 0 380 4
figure 0 380 4
in 0 380 4
the 0 380 4
Bush 0 380 4
administration. 0 380 4

The 0 380 5
Egyptian-American 0 380 5
immigrant 0 380 5
had 0 380 5
served 0 380 5
as 0 380 5
a 0 380 5
gatekeeper 0 380 5
for 0 380 5
George 0 380 5

If 0 380 6
you 0 380 6
wanted 0 380 6
a 0 380 6
job, 0 380 6
you 0 380 6
went 0 380 6
through 0 380 6
her. 0 380 6

Barely 0 380 7
30, 0 380 7
Habib 0 380 7
Powell 0 380 7
had 0 380 7
more 0 380 7
power 0 380 7
than 0 380 7
many 0 380 7
of 0 380 7

era 0 380 7
names 0 380 7
you 0 380 7
do 0 380 7
know. 0 380 7

Then 0 380 8
she 0 380 8
took 0 380 8
on 0 380 8
the 0 380 8
mission 0 380 8
of 0 380 8
promoting 0 380 8

at 0 380 8
the 0 380 8
State 0 380 8

There 0 380 9
were 0 380 9
cultural 0 380 9
exchanges 0 380 9
with 0 380 9
Iran 0 380 9

the 0 380 9

Afterward 0 380 10

Like 0 380 12

You 0 380 15
could 0 380 15

Arianna 0 380 15

a 0 380 15

You 0 380 16
can 0 380 16

The 0 380 17
ATFP 0 380 17

originally 0 380 17
Rashid 0 380 17
Khalidi’s 0 380 17
American 0 380 17
Committee 0 380 17
on 0 380 17
Jerusalem. 0 380 17

Khalidi 0 380 18
was 0 380 18
the 0 380 18
former 0 380 18
PLO 0 380 18
spokesman 0 380 18
at 0 380 18
the 0 380 18

of 0 380 18
the 0 380 18
Obama 0 380 18

scandal. 0 380 18

And 0 380 19
Habib 0 380 19
Powell 0 380 19
was 0 380 19
there 0 380 19
as 0 380 19
a 0 380 19
presenter 0 380 19
at 0 380 19
the 0 380 19
Middle 0 380 19
East 0 380 19

the 0 380 19
PLO’s 0 380 19
Hanan 0 380 19
Ashrawi. 0 380 19

Unlike 0 380 20
McFarland, 0 380 20
Habib 0 380 20
Powell 0 380 20
had 0 380 20
no 0 380 20
national 0 380 20

background. 0 380 20

But 0 380 21
though 0 380 21
her 0 380 21
parents 0 380 21
were 0 380 21
Christians, 0 380 21
she 0 380 21
had 0 380 21
the 0 380 21
“right” 0 380 21
views 0 380 21
on 0 380 21
Islam. 0 380 21

In 0 380 22
Egypt, 0 380 22
she 0 380 22
had 0 380 22
described 0 380 22
how 0 380 22
Bush 0 380 22
after 0 380 22
September 0 380 22
11 0 380 22
had, 0 380 22
“visited 0 380 22
a 0 380 22
mosque, 0 380 22
took 0 380 22
off 0 380 22
his 0 380 22
shoes 0 380 22
and 0 380 22
paid 0 380 22
his 0 380 22
respects.” 0 380 22
"I 0 380 22
see 0 380 22
the 0 380 22

as 0 380 22

I 0 380 22

Habib 0 380 22

attended 0 380 22
such 0 380 22
an 0 380 22

Habib 0 380 23
Powell 0 380 23
has 0 380 23
been 0 380 23
described 0 380 23
as 0 380 23
the 0 380 23
Republican 0 380 23
Huma 0 380 23
Abedin. 0 380 23

And 0 380 24
she 0 380 24
was 0 380 24
quoted 0 380 24
as 0 380 24
saying 0 380 24
that 0 380 24
Abedin 0 380 24
“feels 0 380 24
a 0 380 24
deep 0 380 24

Powell 0 380 25

cheerful 0 380 25

In 0 380 27
2015, 0 380 27
Dina 0 380 27
Powell 0 380 27
– 0 380 27
President 0 380 27

Adviser 0 380 27
in 0 380 27
2017 0 380 27

Samantha 0 380 27
Power 0 380 27
for 0 380 27
an 0 380 27
interview. 0 380 27

In 0 380 28
that 0 380 28
interview, 0 380 28
Powell 0 380 28
heaped 0 380 28
effusive 0 380 28
praise 0 380 28
upon 0 380 28
Power 0 380 28
and 0 380 28
can 0 380 28
be 0 380 28
seen 0 380 28
nodding 0 380 28
in 0 380 28
agreement 0 380 28
throughout. 0 380 28

Power 0 380 29
was 0 380 29
a 0 380 29
senior 0 380 29
adviser 0 380 29
to 0 380 29
President 0 380 29
Barack 0 380 29
Obama. 0 380 29

At 0 380 30
the 0 380 30
time, 0 380 30
Powell 0 380 30
– 0 380 30
an 0 380 30
executive 0 380 30
with 0 380 30
Goldman 0 380 30
Sachs 0 380 30
– 0 380 30
was 0 380 30
pushing 0 380 30
a 0 380 30
pet 0 380 30
project 0 380 30
known 0 380 30
as 0 380 30
10,000 0 380 30
women, 0 380 30
which 0 380 30
is 0 380 30
ostensibly 0 380 30
intended 0 380 30
to 0 380 30
foster 0 380 30
female 0 380 30
entrepreneurship. 0 380 30

When 0 380 31
Powell 0 380 31
was 0 380 31
at 0 380 31
Goldman 0 380 31
Sachs, 0 380 31
her 0 380 31
right-hand 0 380 31

Noa 0 380 31
Meyer. 0 380 31

Perhaps 0 380 32
not 0 380 32
so 0 380 32
coincidentally, 0 380 32
Meyer 0 380 32
worked 0 380 32
in 0 380 32
the 0 380 32
Bill 0 380 32

administration’s 0 380 32

of 0 380 32
then 0 380 32
first-lady 0 380 32
Hillary 0 380 32
Clinton. 0 380 32

Powell 0 380 33
herself, 0 380 33
is 0 380 33
very 0 380 33
comfortable 0 380 33
with 0 380 33
Hillary 0 380 33
Clinton. 0 380 33

In 0 380 34
2013, 0 380 34
she 0 380 34
shared 0 380 34
a 0 380 34
stage 0 380 34
with 0 380 34
Hillary 0 380 34
at 0 380 34
the 0 380 34
Clinton 0 380 34
Global 0 380 34
Initiative. 0 380 34

In 0 380 35
2007, 0 380 35
Powell 0 380 35
was 0 380 35
named 0 380 35
to 0 380 35
the 0 380 35
Board 0 380 35
of 0 380 35
a 0 380 35
Hillary 0 380 35
Clinton 0 380 35
project 0 380 35
known 0 380 35
as 0 380 35
‘Vital 0 380 35
Voices’,another 0 380 35
women-centric 1 380 35
operation 0 380 35
that 0 380 35
touts 0 380 35
Global 0 380 35
Ambassadorial 0 380 35
missions 0 380 35
for 0 380 35
women. 0 380 35

On 0 380 36
June 0 380 36
14, 0 380 36
2016 0 380 36
Powell 0 380 36
participated 0 380 36
in 0 380 36
a 0 380 36
Summit 0 380 36
known 0 380 36
as 0 380 36
the 0 380 36
United 0 380 36
State 0 380 36
of 0 380 36
Women(USW), 0 380 36
which 0 380 36
meshed 1 380 36
nicely 1 380 36
with 0 380 36
her 0 380 36
pet 0 380 36
project. 0 380 36

USW 0 380 37
was 0 380 37
also 0 380 37
rife 0 380 37
with 0 380 37
angry 1 380 37
left-wing 1 380 37
Democrats 1 380 37
seeking 0 380 37
to 0 380 37
get 0 380 37
Hillary 0 380 37
Clinton 0 380 37
elected 0 380 37
in 0 380 37
2016. 0 380 37

In 0 380 38
fact, 0 380 38
Barack 0 380 38
Obama’s 0 380 38
closest 0 380 38
adviser 0 380 38
Valerie 0 380 38
Jarrett 0 380 38
introduced 0 380 38
Powell, 0 380 38
who 0 380 38
returned 0 380 38
the 0 380 38
introduction 0 380 38
with 0 380 38
effusive 0 380 38
praise 0 380 38
for 0 380 38
Jarrett. 0 380 38

The 0 380 39
ex-Goldman 0 380 39
Sachs 0 380 39
executive 0 380 39
has 0 380 39
befriended 0 380 39
Obama’s 0 380 39
closest 0 380 39
adviser, 0 380 39
Valerie 0 380 39
Jarrett. 0 380 39

She 0 380 40
is 0 380 40
also 0 380 40
very 0 380 40
cozy 0 380 40
with 0 380 40
Hillary 0 380 40
Clinton’s 0 380 40
closest 0 380 40
advisers 0 380 40
Huma 0 380 40
Abedin 0 380 40
and 0 380 40
Philippe 0 380 40
Reines. 0 380 40

Now 0 380 41
there's 0 380 41
once 0 380 41
again 0 380 41
talk 0 380 41
of 0 380 41
moving 0 380 41
Dina 0 380 41
Powell 0 380 41
in. 0 380 41

This 0 380 42
time 0 380 42
into 0 380 42
Nikki 0 380 42
Halley's 0 380 42
old 0 380 42
spot 0 380 42
as 0 380 42
UN 0 380 42
Ambassador. 0 380 42

The 0 380 43
talk 0 380 43
comes 0 380 43
from 0 380 43
the 0 380 43
GOP 0 380 43
establishment. 0 380 43

Powell 0 380 44
should 0 380 44
not 0 380 44
be 0 380 44
at 0 380 44
the 0 380 44
NSC, 0 380 44
where 0 380 44
she 0 380 44
replaced 0 380 44
K.T. 0 380 44

McFarland, 0 380 45
who 0 380 45
was 0 380 45
qualified 0 380 45
for 0 380 45
the 0 380 45
job, 0 380 45
at 0 380 45
the 0 380 45
behest 0 380 45
of 0 380 45
H.R. 0 380 45

McMaster. 0 380 46

But 0 380 47
every 0 380 47
job 0 380 47
for 0 380 47
Powell 0 380 47
is 0 380 47
a 0 380 47
stepping 0 380 47
stone 0 380 47
to 0 380 47
the 0 380 47
next 0 380 47
one. 0 380 47

And 0 380 48
the 0 380 48
one 0 380 48
she 0 380 48
has 0 380 48
her 0 380 48
eyes 0 380 48
on 0 380 48
now 0 380 48
would 0 380 48
be 0 380 48
an 0 380 48
even 1 380 48
bigger 1 380 48
disaster. 1 380 48

Making 0 380 49
Dina 0 380 49
Powell 0 380 49
the 0 380 49
US 0 380 49
Ambassador 0 380 49
to 0 380 49
the 0 380 49
UN 0 380 49
would 0 380 49
quickly 0 380 49
undo 0 380 49
all 0 380 49
the 0 380 49
progress 0 380 49
that 0 380 49
Haley 0 380 49
made. 0 380 49

Before 0 380 50
long 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
US 0 380 50
would 0 380 50
be 0 380 50
right 0 380 50
back 0 380 50
in 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
Human 0 380 50
Rights 0 380 50
Council, 0 380 50
there 0 380 50
would 0 380 50
be 0 380 50
moves 0 380 50
in 0 380 50
favor 0 380 50
of 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
PLO, 0 380 50
and 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
same 1 380 50
old 1 380 50
failed 1 380 50
politics 1 380 50
would 0 380 50
be 0 380 50
back. 0 380 50

Haley 0 380 51
sent 0 380 51
a 0 380 51
message 0 380 51
that 0 380 51
UN 0 380 51
members 0 380 51
will 0 380 51
be 0 380 51
punished 0 380 51
if 0 380 51
they 0 380 51
push 0 380 51
the 0 380 51
US 0 380 51
around. 0 380 51

Powell 0 380 52
would 0 380 52
swiftly 1 380 52
undo 1 380 52
that. 0 380 52

Dina 0 380 53
Powell 0 380 53
would 0 380 53
have 0 380 53
been 0 380 53
a 0 380 53
Jeb 0 380 53
Bush 0 380 53
appointee. 0 380 53

Appointing 1 380 54
her 1 380 54
to 1 380 54
the 1 380 54
UN 1 380 54
would 1 380 54
give 1 380 54
Trump, 1 380 54
Jeb 1 380 54
Bush's 1 380 54
policies. 1 380 54

You 0 380 55
don't 0 380 55
drain 0 380 55
the 0 380 55
swamp 0 380 55
by 0 380 55
appointing 0 380 55
the 0 380 55
swamp. 0 380 55

And 0 380 55

Powell 0 380 55

is 0 380 55

one 1 380 55

of 1 380 55

the 1 380 55

Coordinated 0 383 0

Yesterday, 0 383 1
the 0 383 1
alternative 0 383 1
media 0 383 1
purge 0 383 1
was 0 383 1
boldly 1 383 1
advanced 0 383 1
in 0 383 1
a 0 383 1
coordinated 0 383 1
effort 0 383 1
to 0 383 1
silence 0 383 1
people 0 383 1
who 0 383 1
dissent 0 383 1
from 0 383 1
establishment 0 383 1
views. 0 383 1

It’s 0 383 2
just 0 383 2
one 0 383 2
more 0 383 2
step 0 383 2
toward 0 383 2
a 0 383 2
monopoly 0 383 2
on 0 383 2
information 0 383 2
by 0 383 2
those 1 383 2
who 1 383 2

freedom. 1 383 2

At 0 383 3
this 0 383 3

they’ll 0 383 3
soon 0 383 3
have 0 383 3

And 0 383 4
this 1 383 4
should 1 383 4
terrify 1 383 4
everyone 1 383 4
who 1 383 4

The 0 383 37
Washington 0 383 37

originally 0 383 37

that 0 383 37

But 0 383 39
of 0 383 39
course, 0 383 39
since 0 383 39
they 0 383 39
too 0 383 39
push 0 383 39

(waaah, 0 383 39

they 0 383 40

to 0 383 40
“Facebook 0 383 40

The 0 383 41
fact 0 383 41
that 0 383 41
many 0 383 41
of 0 383 41
these 0 383 41

were 0 383 41
also 0 383 41
suspended 0 383 41
by 0 383 41
Twitter 0 383 41
shortly 0 383 41
thereafter 0 383 41
should 0 383 41
tell 0 383 41
you 0 383 41
that 0 383 41
this 1 383 41
is 1 383 41
a 1 383 41
coordinated 1 383 41
effort 1 383 41
to 1 383 41
silence 1 383 41
large 1 383 41
swaths 1 383 41
of 1 383 41
the 1 383 41
population. 1 383 41

Of 0 383 42
course, 0 383 42
the 0 383 42
best 0 383 42
coverage 0 383 42
of 0 383 42
this 0 383 42
is 0 383 42
from…Russia. 0 383 42

Sputnik 0 383 43
News 0 383 43
contacted 0 383 43
many 0 383 43
of 0 383 43
the 0 383 43
alternative 0 383 43
journalists 0 383 43
who 0 383 43
were 0 383 43
purged 0 383 43
to 0 383 43
get 0 383 43
their 0 383 43
take 0 383 43
on 0 383 43
what 0 383 43
happened. 0 383 43

You 0 383 44
may 0 383 44
recall 0 383 44
that 0 383 44
basically 0 383 44
every 0 383 44
blogger 0 383 44
outside 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
establishment 0 383 44
media 0 383 44
was 0 383 44
accused 0 383 44
of 0 383 44
being 0 383 44
secretly 0 383 44
Russian 0 383 44
during 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
2016 0 383 44
election 0 383 44
by 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
Washington 0 383 44
Post, 0 383 44
so 0 383 44
perhaps 0 383 44
actual 0 383 44
Russians 0 383 44
have 0 383 44
a 0 383 44
vested 0 383 44
interest 0 383 44
in 0 383 44
the 0 383 44
truth 0 383 44
coming 0 383 44
out 0 383 44
on 0 383 44
this 0 383 44
topic. 0 383 44

My 0 383 45
friend 0 383 45
John 0 383 45
Vibes 0 383 45
is 0 383 45
an 1 383 45
amazing 1 383 45
person 1 383 45
who 0 383 45
contributes 0 383 45
to 0 383 45
The 0 383 45
Free 0 383 45
Thought 0 383 45
Project. 0 383 45

He 0 383 46
said: 0 383 46

This 0 383 47
signifies 0 383 47
a 0 383 47
re-consolidation 0 383 47
of 0 383 47
the 0 383 47
media. 0 383 47

Cable 0 383 48
news 0 383 48
media 0 383 48
controlled 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
narrative 0 383 48
for 0 383 48
most 0 383 48
of 0 383 48
modern 0 383 48
history, 0 383 48
but 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
internet 0 383 48
has 0 383 48
lowered 0 383 48
that 0 383 48
barrier 0 383 48
to 0 383 48
entry 0 383 48
and 0 383 48
allowed 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
average 0 383 48
person 0 383 48
to 0 383 48
become 0 383 48
the 0 383 48
media 0 383 48
themselves. 0 383 48

This 0 383 49
obviously 0 383 49
took 0 383 49
market 0 383 49
share 0 383 49
and 0 383 49
influence 0 383 49
away 0 383 49
from 0 383 49
the 0 383 49
traditional 0 383 49
media, 0 383 49
and 0 383 49
it 0 383 49
has 0 383 49
allowed 0 383 49
for 0 383 49
a 0 383 49
more 0 383 49
diverse 0 383 49
public 0 383 49
conversation. 0 383 49

Now 0 383 50
it 0 383 50
seems 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
platforms 0 383 50
that 0 383 50
have 0 383 50
monopolized 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
industry 0 383 50
are 0 383 50
favoring 0 383 50
mainstream 0 383 50
sources 0 383 50
and 0 383 50
silencing 0 383 50
alternative 0 383 50
voices. 0 383 50

So 0 383 51
now, 0 383 51
instead 0 383 51
of 0 383 51
allowing 0 383 51
more 0 383 51
people 0 383 51
to 0 383 51
have 0 383 51
a 0 383 51
voice, 0 383 51
these 0 383 51
platforms 0 383 51
are 0 383 51
creating 0 383 51
an 0 383 51
atmosphere 0 383 51
where 0 383 51
only 0 383 51
powerful 0 383 51
media 0 383 51
organizations 0 383 51
are 0 383 51
welcome, 0 383 51
just 0 383 51
as 0 383 51
we 0 383 51
had 0 383 51
on 0 383 51
cable 0 383 51
news. 0 383 51

People 0 383 52
think 0 383 52
that 0 383 52
we 0 383 52
are 0 383 52
just 0 383 52
providing 0 383 52
an 0 383 52
activist 0 383 52
spin 0 383 52
on 0 383 52
the 0 383 52
news, 0 383 52
but 0 383 52
they 0 383 52
don’t 0 383 52
see 0 383 52
the 0 383 52
families 0 383 52
struggling 0 383 52
to 0 383 52
have 0 383 52
their 0 383 52
voice 0 383 52
heard. 0 383 52

For 0 383 53
example, 0 383 53
when 0 383 53
someone 0 383 53
is 0 383 53
shot 0 383 53
by 0 383 53
police, 0 383 53
mainstream 0 383 53
media 0 383 53
sources 0 383 53
often 0 383 53
just 0 383 53
republish 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
press 0 383 53
release 0 383 53
from 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
police 0 383 53
department, 0 383 53
without 0 383 53
presenting 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
victim’s 0 383 53
side 0 383 53
of 0 383 53
the 0 383 53
story. 0 383 53

We 0 383 54
give 0 383 54
the 0 383 54
victims 0 383 54
and 0 383 54
their 0 383 54
families 0 383 54
a 0 383 54
voice, 0 383 54
which 0 383 54
is 0 383 54
essential 0 383 54
to 0 383 54
keep 0 383 54
power 0 383 54
in 0 383 54
check. 0 383 54

This 0 383 55
also 0 383 55
goes 0 383 55
for 0 383 55
bigger 0 383 55
issues 0 383 55
like 0 383 55
foreign 0 383 55
policy 0 383 55
as 0 383 55
well; 0 383 55
multiple 0 383 55
full-scale 0 383 55
invasions 0 383 55
of 0 383 55
Syria 0 383 55
have 0 383 55
been 0 383 55
prevented 0 383 55
because 0 383 55
of 0 383 55
information 0 383 55
that 0 383 55

Our 0 383 60
approach 0 383 60
generally 0 383 60
is 0 383 60
to 0 383 60
cover 0 383 60
stories 0 383 60
and 0 383 60
angles 0 383 60
that 0 383 60
corporate 0 383 60

underreport 0 383 60

misreport 0 383 60

to 0 383 60
amplify 0 383 60
activist 0 383 60
and 0 383 60
anti-war 0 383 60
voices 0 383 60

All 0 383 61
of 0 383 61
our 0 383 61

is 0 383 61
professionally 0 383 61
fact-checked 0 383 61
and 0 383 61
edited. 0 383 61

I 0 383 62
got 0 383 62
into 0 383 62
this 0 383 62
line 0 383 62
of 0 383 62
work 0 383 62
because 0 383 62
I 0 383 62
felt 0 383 62
there 0 383 62
was 0 383 62
a 0 383 62
need 0 383 62
for 0 383 62
media 0 383 62
that 0 383 62
challenged 0 383 62
mainstream 0 383 62
assumptions 0 383 62
and 0 383 62
biases 0 383 62
in 0 383 62
politics. 0 383 62

I 0 383 63
wanted 0 383 63
to 0 383 63
shed 0 383 63
light 0 383 63
on 0 383 63
corruption 0 383 63
and 0 383 63
wrongdoing 0 383 63
against 0 383 63
oppressed 0 383 63
peoples 0 383 63
and 0 383 63
cover 0 383 63
the 0 383 63
harsh 1 383 63
truth 1 383 63
about 0 383 63
American 0 383 63
foreign 0 383 63
policy. 0 383 63

Over 0 383 64
the 0 383 64
last 0 383 64
28 0 383 64
days, 0 383 64
we 0 383 64
reached 0 383 64
7,088,000 0 383 64
people 0 383 64
on 0 383 64

The 0 383 65
timing 0 383 65
of 0 383 65
this 0 383 65
purge 0 383 65
is 0 383 65
rather 0 383 65
dubious 1 383 65
in 0 383 65
my 0 383 65
view, 0 383 65
coming 0 383 65
shortly 0 383 65
before 0 383 65
the 0 383 65
midterm 0 383 65
elections. 0 383 65

This 1 383 66
could 1 383 66
be 1 383 66
an 1 383 66
attempt 1 383 66
by 1 383 66
Facebook 1 383 66
itself 1 383 66
to 1 383 66
affect 1 383 66
the 1 383 66
outcome 1 383 66
of 1 383 66
the 1 383 66
coming 1 383 66
elections. 1 383 66

The 0 383 67
Twitter 0 383 67
suspension 0 383 67
caught 0 383 67
me 0 383 67
by 0 383 67
surprise. 0 383 67

I 0 383 68
can 0 383 68
only 0 383 68
speculate 0 383 68
that 0 383 68
these 0 383 68
suspensions 0 383 68
were 0 383 68
a 1 383 68
coordinated 1 383 68
effort 1 383 68
to 1 383 68
stifle 1 383 68
our 1 383 68
message 1 383 68
ahead 1 383 68
of 1 383 68
the 1 383 68
coming 1 383 68
elections. 1 383 68

Remember, 0 383 70
this 0 383 70
is 0 383 70
coordinated, 1 383 70
across 0 383 70
multiple 0 383 70
platforms. 0 383 70

Remember 0 383 71
when 0 383 71
this 0 383 71
happened 0 383 71
to 0 383 71
Alex 0 383 71
Jones? 0 383 71

Back 0 383 72
in 0 383 72
September, 0 383 72
an 0 383 72
assault 1 383 72
was 0 383 72
led 0 383 72
by 0 383 72
YouTube, 0 383 72
Google, 0 383 72
and 0 383 72

against 0 383 72
Alex 0 383 72
Jones 0 383 72
of 0 383 72
Infowars 0 383 72
fame. 0 383 72

All 0 383 73
of 0 383 73
his 0 383 73
accounts 0 383 73
were 0 383 73
shut 0 383 73
down 0 383 73
in 0 383 73
quick 0 383 73
succession, 0 383 73
followed 0 383 73
by 0 383 73
his 0 383 73
credit 0 383 73
card 0 383 73
processing 0 383 73
companies 0 383 73
and 0 383 73
his 0 383 73
newsletter 0 383 73
service 0 383 73
providers. 0 383 73

I 0 383 74
wrote 0 383 74
at 0 383 74
the 0 383 74
time, 0 383 74
“Alex 0 383 74
Jones 0 383 74
is 0 383 74
just 0 383 74
the 0 383 74
beginning 0 383 74
of 0 383 74
this 0 383 74
purge. 0 383 74

It’s 0 383 75
going 0 383 75
to 0 383 75
get 0 383 75
much 0 383 75
worse.” 0 383 75

Meanwhile, 0 383 76
other 0 383 76
dissenting 0 383 76

were 0 383 76
being 0 383 76
silenced 0 383 76
on 0 383 76
social 0 383 76
media 0 383 76
with 0 383 76
limited 0 383 76
reach 0 383 76
and 0 383 76
“shadow 0 383 76
banning.” 0 383 76

Infowars 0 383 77
is 0 383 77
a 0 383 77
massive 0 383 77
profit 0 383 77
machine. 0 383 77

But 0 383 78
what 0 383 78
happens 0 383 78
when 0 383 78
similar 0 383 78
attacks 0 383 78
are 0 383 78
launched 0 383 78
on 0 383 78
smaller 0 383 78
alternative 0 383 78
media 0 383 78
outlets? 0 383 78

It 0 383 79
hits 0 383 79
us 0 383 79
right 0 383 79
in 0 383 79
the 0 383 79
wallet. 0 383 79

And 0 383 80
if 0 383 80
they’re 0 383 80
hit 0 383 80
hard 0 383 80
enough, 0 383 80
they’ll 0 383 80
cease 0 383 80
to 0 383 80
be 0 383 80
able 0 383 80
to 0 383 80
function. 0 383 80

Jones 0 383 81
has 0 383 81
a 0 383 81
lot 0 383 81
of 0 383 81
money 0 383 81
so 0 383 81
this 0 383 81
may 0 383 81
not 0 383 81
be 0 383 81
the 0 383 81
end 0 383 81
of 0 383 81
him, 0 383 81
but 0 383 81
for 0 383 81
most 0 383 81
website 0 383 81
owners, 0 383 81
this 0 383 81
would 0 383 81
be 0 383 81
the 0 383 81
absolute 0 383 81
end 0 383 81
of 0 383 81
our 0 383 81
ability 0 383 81
to 0 383 81
do 0 383 81
business. 0 383 81

And 0 383 82
to 0 383 82
be 0 383 82
able 0 383 82
to 0 383 82
bring 0 383 82
the 0 383 82
information 0 383 82
we 0 383 82
bring, 0 383 82
we 0 383 82

run 0 383 82
our 0 383 82
websites 0 383 82
as 0 383 82
businesses. 0 383 82

It’s 0 383 83
far 0 383 83
more 0 383 83
expensive 0 383 83
than 0 383 83
most 0 383 83
people 0 383 83
realize 0 383 83
to 0 383 83
run 0 383 83
a 0 383 83

I 0 383 84
know 0 383 84
that 0 383 84
my 0 383 84
own 0 383 84
operating 0 383 84
costs 0 383 84
every 0 383 84
month 0 383 84
are 0 383 84
more 0 383 84
than 0 383 84
$2000. 0 383 84

A 0 383 85
site 0 383 85
as 0 383 85
big 0 383 85
as 0 383 85
Jones’s 0 383 85
would 0 383 85
be 0 383 85
many 0 383 85
times 0 383 85
that 0 383 85
amount. 0 383 85

When 0 383 86
all 0 383 86
your 0 383 86
avenues 0 383 86
of 0 383 86
monetization 0 383 86

cut 0 383 86
off, 0 383 86
it 0 383 86
wouldn’t 0 383 86
be 0 383 86
hard 0 383 86
for 0 383 86
a 0 383 86

The 0 383 111
danger 0 383 111
– 0 383 111

the 0 383 111

This 0 383 112

you’re 0 383 113
missing 0 383 113
the 0 383 113

point. 0 383 113

Consider 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
fact 0 383 114
that 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
“population” 0 383 114

The 0 389 31
obvious 0 389 31
question 0 389 31
I 0 389 31
have 0 389 31
is: 0 389 31
Why 0 389 31
are 0 389 31
you 0 389 31
not 0 389 31
stopping 0 389 31
those 0 389 31
payments 0 389 31
now, 0 389 31
Mr. 0 389 31
President? 0 389 31

They 0 389 32
are 0 389 32
unconstitutional 1 389 32
and 0 389 32
neither 0 389 32
Congress 0 389 32
nor 0 389 32
you 0 389 32
have 0 389 32
the 0 389 32
authority 0 389 32
to 0 389 32
give 0 389 32
American's 1 389 32

to 0 389 32
these 0 389 32

Trump 0 389 33
also 0 389 33
seemed 0 389 33
ready 0 389 33
to 0 389 33
back 0 389 33
out 0 389 33
on 0 389 33
his 0 389 33
new 0 389 33
trade 0 389 33
deal, 0 389 33
which 0 389 33
is 0 389 33
hardly 0 389 33
a 0 389 33
deal 0 389 33
for 0 389 33
the 0 389 33
US, 0 389 33
with 0 389 33
Mexico 0 389 33
if 0 389 33
they 0 389 33
failed 0 389 33
to 0 389 33
stop 0 389 33
the 0 389 33

He 0 389 34
then 0 389 34
pointed 0 389 34
out 0 389 34
that 0 389 34
many 0 389 34
who 0 389 34
cross 0 389 34
the 0 389 34

by 0 390 11
a 0 390 11
massive 0 390 11
campaign 0 390 11
of 0 390 11
“fake 0 390 11
news” 0 390 11
awareness. 0 390 11

One 0 390 12
thing 0 390 12
we 0 390 12
need 0 390 12
to 0 390 12
remember 0 390 12
here 0 390 12
is, 0 390 12
this 0 390 12
isn’t 0 390 12
about 0 390 12
democrats 0 390 12
vs 0 390 12
republicans, 0 390 12
it’s 0 390 12
about 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
elite 1 390 12
preserving 0 390 12
their 0 390 12
control, 0 390 12
and 0 390 12
at 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
moment, 0 390 12
they 0 390 12
are 0 390 12
using 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
DNC 0 390 12
as 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
mouthpiece 0 390 12
for 0 390 12
that. 0 390 12

Thus, 0 390 13
anything 0 390 13
that 0 390 13
slandered 0 390 13
Hillary 0 390 13
Clinton 0 390 13
during 0 390 13
the 0 390 13
presidential 0 390 13
campaign, 0 390 13
for 0 390 13
example, 0 390 13
was 0 390 13
labelled 0 390 13
as 0 390 13
fake 0 390 13
news, 0 390 13
even 0 390 13
if 0 390 13
evidence 0 390 13
and 0 390 13
credible 0 390 13
sources 0 390 13
were 0 390 13
used. 0 390 13

This 0 390 14
is 0 390 14
because 0 390 14
she 0 390 14
is 0 390 14
part 0 390 14
of 0 390 14
that 0 390 14
elite. 1 390 14

This 0 390 15
is 0 390 15
cyber 0 390 15
false 0 390 15
flagging 0 390 15
at 0 390 15
its 0 390 15

where 0 390 15
authority 0 390 15

and 0 390 15
within 0 390 15

decide 0 390 15
for 0 390 15
the 0 390 15

what 0 390 15

what 0 390 15
is 0 390 15
not, 0 390 15
These 0 390 15
tactics 0 390 15
are 0 390 15
complemented 0 390 15
by 0 390 15
a 0 390 15
large 0 390 15

what 0 390 18

still 0 390 18
now, 0 390 18
and 0 390 18
take 0 390 18
on 0 390 18
the 0 390 18

has 0 390 31
become 0 390 31
a 0 390 31
revolving 0 390 31

like 0 390 31
Monsanto, 0 390 31
with 0 390 31
high-ranking 0 390 31
DARPA 0 390 31

is 0 390 32

at 0 390 33
the 0 390 33
moment 0 390 33
it 0 390 33
seems 0 390 33
to 0 390 33
be 0 390 33
censoring 0 390 33
of 0 390 33
information. 0 390 33

Their 0 390 34
key 0 390 34
strategy 0 390 34
is 0 390 34
to 0 390 34
label 0 390 34
everything 0 390 34
as 0 390 34

like 0 390 35

became 0 390 35
extremely 0 390 35

many 0 390 35

something 0 390 37

it 0 390 40

“conspiracy 0 390 44
theory” 0 390 44
and 0 390 44
turn 0 390 44
their 0 390 44
heads 0 390 44
away, 0 390 44
the 0 390 44
easier 0 390 44
it 0 390 44
is 0 390 44
for 0 390 44
them 0 390 44
to 0 390 44
continue 0 390 44
and 0 390 44
have 0 390 44
power. 0 390 44

I 0 390 45
don’t 0 390 45
understand 0 390 45
how 0 390 45
so 0 390 45
much 0 390 45
information 0 390 45
can 0 390 45
come 0 390 45
to 0 390 45
light, 0 390 45
yet 0 390 45
when 0 390 45
it’s 0 390 45
deemed 0 390 45
a 0 390 45
“conspiracy” 0 390 45
theory” 0 390 45
within 0 390 45
mainstream 0 390 45
media, 0 390 45
everybody 0 390 45
simply 0 390 45
follows 0 390 45
the 0 390 45
rhetoric, 0 390 45
without 0 390 45
doing 0 390 45
any 0 390 45
investigation 0 390 45
or 0 390 45
research 0 390 45
for 0 390 45
themselves. 0 390 45

If 0 390 46
you 0 390 46
don’t 0 390 46
look 0 390 46
into 0 390 46
it, 0 390 46
don’t 0 390 46
share 0 390 46
an 0 390 46
opinion 0 390 46
on 0 390 46
it. 0 390 46

“Condemnation 0 390 47
without 0 390 47
investigation 0 390 47
is 0 390 47
the 0 390 47
height 0 390 47
of 0 390 47
ignorance.” 0 390 47
– 0 390 47
Einstein. 0 390 47

All 0 390 48
of 0 390 48
these 0 390 48
media 0 390 48
sources 0 390 48
were 0 390 48
operating 0 390 48
normally 0 390 48
until 0 390 48
Donald 0 390 48
Trump 0 390 48
became 0 390 48
president, 0 390 48
and 0 390 48
until 0 390 48
Hillary 0 390 48
Clinton, 0 390 48
Obama, 0 390 48
Bush, 0 390 48
etc 0 390 48
were 0 390 48
outed 0 390 48
as 0 390 48
global 1 390 48
elite 1 390 48
puppets. 1 390 48

Heck, 0 390 49
the 0 390 49
Clinton’s 0 390 49
and 0 390 49
John 0 390 49
Podesta 0 390 49
have 0 390 49
even 0 390 49
referenced 0 390 49
Wikileaks 0 390 49
before 0 390 49
that 0 390 49
became 0 390 49
‘fake.’ 0 390 49
Despite 0 390 49
operating 0 390 49
with 0 390 49
credibility 0 390 49
for 0 390 49
more 0 390 49
than 0 390 49
a 0 390 49
decade 0 390 49
before 0 390 49
the 0 390 49
accusations. 0 390 49

What 0 390 50
does 0 390 50
the 0 390 50
media 0 390 50
operating 0 390 50
normally 0 390 50
mean? 0 390 50

Still 0 390 51
manipulating 0 390 51
the 0 390 51
public, 0 390 51
but 0 390 51
at 0 390 51
least 0 390 51
they 0 390 51
were 0 390 51
reporting 0 390 51
on 0 390 51
both 0 390 51
sides 0 390 51
as 0 390 51
a 0 390 51
whole. 0 390 51

Now, 0 390 52
it’s 0 390 52
quite 0 390 52
different. 0 390 52

Donald 0 390 53
Trump 0 390 53
is 0 390 53
extremely 1 390 53
vilified 1 390 53
not 0 390 53
because 0 390 53
he 0 390 53
allegedly 0 390 53
is/was 0 390 53
racist/sexist, 0 390 53
but 0 390 53
because 1 390 53
he 1 390 53
threatens 1 390 53
neoliberalism 1 390 53
and 1 390 53
neoconservatism, 1 390 53
the 1 390 53
American 1 390 53
empire, 1 390 53
one 0 390 53
that 0 390 53
continues 0 390 53
to 0 390 53
try 0 390 53
and 0 390 53
push 0 390 53
an 0 390 53
Orwellian 0 390 53
state 0 390 53
type 0 390 53
of 0 390 53
existence, 0 390 53
which 0 390 53
seems 0 390 53
to 0 390 53
be 0 390 53
ramping 0 390 53
up 0 390 53
every 0 390 53
single 0 390 53
year. 0 390 53

Trump 0 390 54
was 0 390 54
not 0 390 54
supposed 0 390 54
to 0 390 54
win, 0 390 54
and 0 390 54
no 1 390 54
this 1 390 54
isn’t 1 390 54
about 1 390 54
democrats 1 390 54
vs 1 390 54
republicans 1 390 54
or 0 390 54
that 0 390 54
Trump 0 390 54
is 0 390 54
a 1 390 54
saviour. 1 390 54

The 0 390 55
Deep 0 390 55
State 0 390 55
responded 0 390 55
like 0 390 55
they 0 390 55
always 0 390 55
do 0 390 55
every 0 390 55
time 0 390 55
something 0 390 55
‘goes 0 390 55
wrong,’ 0 390 55
they 0 390 55
blamed 0 390 55
Russia, 0 390 55
as 0 390 55
well 0 390 55
as 0 390 55
media 0 390 55
outlets 0 390 55
like 0 390 55
Collective 0 390 55
Evolution 0 390 55
and 0 390 55
others. 0 390 55

Some 0 390 56
of 0 390 56
which 0 390 56
have 0 390 56
now 0 390 56
been 0 390 56
deleted 0 390 56
as 0 390 56
mentioned 0 390 56
above. 0 390 56

Trump 1 390 57
is 1 390 57
Not 1 390 57
The 1 390 57
Solution, 1 390 57
We 1 390 57
Are 1 390 57

Things 0 390 58
are 0 390 58
getting 0 390 58
pretty 1 390 58
ridiculous, 1 390 58
but 0 390 58
they’re 0 390 58
too 0 390 58
late. 0 390 58

Even 0 390 59
if 0 390 59
they 0 390 59
do 0 390 59
succeed 0 390 59
in 0 390 59
deleting 0 390 59
more 0 390 59
independent 0 390 59
media 0 390 59
sites 0 390 59
from 0 390 59
social 0 390 59

they 0 390 59
cannot 0 390 59
erase 0 390 59
them 0 390 59
from 0 390 59
the 0 390 59
internet. 0 390 59

Yes, 0 390 60
social 0 390 60
media 0 390 60
platforms 0 390 60
were 0 390 60
great 0 390 60
for 0 390 60
spreading 0 390 60
information 0 390 60
across 0 390 60
the 0 390 60
internet 0 390 60
and 0 390 60
for 0 390 60
having 0 390 60
more 0 390 60
people 0 390 60
become 0 390 60
aware 0 390 60
of 0 390 60
it. 0 390 60

It 0 390 61
really 0 390 61
showed 0 390 61
what 0 390 61
people 0 390 61
were 0 390 61
interested 0 390 61
in, 0 390 61
and 0 390 61
what 0 390 61
people 0 390 61
wanted 0 390 61
to 0 390 61
see, 0 390 61
but 0 390 61
clearly, 0 390 61
we 1 390 61
do 1 390 61
not 1 390 61
live 1 390 61
in 1 390 61
a 1 390 61
democracy 1 390 61

that 0 390 63
what 0 390 63

see 0 390 63
coming 0 390 63
from 0 390 63

highly 0 390 63

more 0 390 64
people 0 390 64
see 0 390 64
it 0 390 64
this 0 390 64

because 0 390 64
our 0 390 64
consciousness 0 390 64
continues 0 390 64
to 0 390 64
shift. 0 390 64

Social 0 390 65
media 0 390 65
platforms 0 390 65
do 0 390 65
not 0 390 65
control 0 390 65

have 0 390 65

a 0 390 65
great 0 390 65

it’s 0 390 65
something 0 390 65
that 0 390 65
cannot 0 390 65
be 0 390 65

The 0 390 66
more 0 390 66
we 0 390 66
awaken 0 390 66
and 0 390 66
truly 0 390 66

past 0 390 66

Now, 0 390 68
all 0 390 68
of 0 390 68
this 0 390 68
seems 0 390 68
to 0 390 68
be 0 390 68
taking 0 390 68

with 0 390 68
perfect 0 390 68
timing 0 390 68
before 0 390 68
the 0 390 68
2020 0 390 68

No 0 390 69
doubt 0 390 69
that 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
Deep 0 390 69
State 0 390 69
will 0 390 69
want 0 390 69
to 0 390 69
take 0 390 69
back 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
presidency, 0 390 69
but 0 390 69
ultimately, 0 390 69
we 0 390 69
need 0 390 69
to 0 390 69
see 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
bigger 0 390 69
picture 0 390 69
here. 0 390 69

We 0 390 70
need 0 390 70
to 0 390 70
see 0 390 70
what 0 390 70
politics 0 390 70
actually 0 390 70
is, 0 390 70
and 0 390 70
the 0 390 70
past 0 390 70
few 0 390 70
years 0 390 70
alone 0 390 70
have 0 390 70
provided 0 390 70
us 0 390 70
with 0 390 70
the 0 390 70
opportunity 0 390 70
to 0 390 70
see. 0 390 70

It’s 0 390 71
nothing 0 390 71
but 0 390 71
elite 1 390 71
people, 0 390 71
corporations 0 390 71
and 0 390 71
the 0 390 71
financial 0 390 71
elite 1 390 71
that 0 390 71
have 0 390 71
become 0 390 71
drenched 0 390 71
with 0 390 71
so 0 390 71
much 0 390 71
power 0 390 71
that 0 390 71
they 0 390 71
have 0 390 71
been 0 390 71
able 0 390 71
to 0 390 71
direct 0 390 71
human 0 390 71
will 0 390 71
and 0 390 71
use 0 390 71
it 0 390 71
for 0 390 71
their 0 390 71
own 0 390 71
selfish 0 390 71
purposes. 0 390 71

With 0 390 72
powerful 1 390 72
revelations 0 390 72
that 0 390 72
have 0 390 72
come 0 390 72
to 0 390 72
light, 0 390 72
like 0 390 72
elite 1 390 72
pedophilia 1 390 72
and 0 390 72
ritual 1 390 72
abuse, 1 390 72
and 0 390 72
extreme 1 390 72
corruption, 0 390 72
why 0 390 72
do 0 390 72
we 0 390 72
still 0 390 72
participate? 0 390 72

Why 0 390 73
do 0 390 73
we 0 390 73
choose 0 390 73
to 0 390 73
elect 0 390 73
these 0 390 73
people? 0 390 73

Why 0 390 74
do 0 390 74
we 0 390 74
believe 0 390 74
we 0 390 74
live 0 390 74
in 0 390 74
a 0 390 74
democracy 0 390 74
when 0 390 74
what 0 390 74
people 0 390 74
want 0 390 74
to 0 390 74
look 0 390 74
at, 0 390 74
and 0 390 74
what 0 390 74
the 0 390 74
majority 0 390 74
of 0 390 74
people 0 390 74
want 0 390 74
to 0 390 74
have 0 390 74
done 0 390 74
(like 0 390 74
GMO-labelling), 0 390 74
is 0 390 74
completely 0 390 74
censored? 0 390 74

Why 0 390 75
are 0 390 75
harmful 1 390 75
‘things’ 0 390 75
surrounding 0 390 75
us 0 390 75
constantly 0 390 75
when 0 390 75
we 0 390 75
have 0 390 75
science 0 390 75
showing 0 390 75
it’s 0 390 75
not 0 390 75
safe, 0 390 75
like 0 390 75
cell 0 390 75
phone 0 390 75
towers 0 390 75
etc. 0 390 75

It’s 0 390 76
simply 0 390 76
because 0 390 76
power 0 390 76
lies 0 390 76
within 0 390 76
the 0 390 76
corporatocracy. 0 390 76

Decisions 0 390 77
aren’t 0 390 77
being 0 390 77
made 0 390 77
with 0 390 77
the 0 390 77
best 0 390 77
interest 0 390 77
of 0 390 77
humanity 0 390 77
at 0 390 77
heart, 0 390 77
and 0 390 77
this 0 390 77
is 0 390 77
why 0 390 77
the 0 390 77
system 0 390 77
is 0 390 77
failing 0 390 77
because 0 390 77
it’s 0 390 77
not 0 390 77
actually 0 390 77
for 0 390 77
the 0 390 77

fact 0 390 82
of 0 390 82
the 0 390 82
matter 0 390 82
is: 0 390 82

This 0 390 86
is 0 390 86
what’s 0 390 86
unravelling, 0 390 86

The 0 390 87
Takeaway 0 390 87

Recognize 0 390 88
what’s 0 390 88
happening, 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
massive 0 390 88
censorship 0 390 88
of 0 390 88
information, 0 390 88
coupled 0 390 88
with 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
ridicule 0 390 88
or 0 390 88
finger 0 390 88
pointing, 0 390 88
or 0 390 88
even 0 390 88
arrest 0 390 88
of 0 390 88
people 0 390 88
who 0 390 88
choose 0 390 88
to 0 390 88
voice 0 390 88
an 0 390 88
opinion 0 390 88
in 0 390 88
opposition 0 390 88
to 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
rhetoric 0 390 88
that’s 0 390 88
constantly 0 390 88
spewed 1 390 88
by 0 390 88
mainstream 0 390 88
media, 0 390 88
which 0 390 88
in 0 390 88
turn 0 390 88
is 0 390 88
usually 0 390 88
believed 0 390 88
by 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
masses. 0 390 88

At 0 390 89
the 0 390 89
same 0 390 89
time, 0 390 89
independent 0 390 89
media 0 390 89
represents 0 390 89
a 0 390 89
shift 0 390 89
in 0 390 89
consciousness. 0 390 89

A 0 390 90
shift 0 390 90
in 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
perceptions, 0 390 90
thoughts, 0 390 90
feelings 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
general 0 390 90
self-awareness 0 390 90
about 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
own 0 390 90
planet 0 390 90
is 0 390 90
changing, 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
thus, 0 390 90
change 0 390 90
has 0 390 90
been 0 390 90
sprouted 0 390 90
in 0 390 90
multiple 0 390 90
different 0 390 90
areas, 0 390 90
including 0 390 90
political 0 390 90
corruption 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
the 0 390 90
stranglehold 0 390 90
it 0 390 90
has 0 390 90
over 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
world. 0 390 90

We 0 390 91
are 0 390 91
more 0 390 91
aware, 0 390 91
but 0 390 91
there 0 390 91
is 0 390 91
still 0 390 91
some 0 390 91
ways 0 390 91
to 0 390 91
go… 0 390 91

A 0 390 92
good 0 390 92
chunk 0 390 92
of 0 390 92
work 0 390 92
has 0 390 92
been 0 390 92
done. 0 390 92

A 0 390 93
massive 1 390 93
transformation 0 390 93
of 0 390 93
consciousness 0 390 93
has 0 390 93
taken 0 390 93
place 0 390 93
and 0 390 93
it 0 390 93
seems 0 390 93
that 0 390 93
a 0 390 93
global 0 390 93
mass 0 390 93
is 0 390 93
growing 0 390 93
closer 0 390 93
to 0 390 93
a 0 390 93
critical 0 390 93
mass. 0 390 93

The 0 390 94
censorship 0 390 94
of 0 390 94
independent 0 390 94
media 0 390 94
is 0 390 94
irrelevant 0 390 94
in 0 390 94
a 0 390 94
sense, 0 390 94
because 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
shift 0 390 94
will 0 390 94
continue 0 390 94
to 0 390 94
happen, 0 390 94
change 0 390 94
will 1 390 94
continue 1 390 94
to 1 390 94
happen, 1 390 94
and 0 390 94
information 0 390 94
that 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
deep 0 390 94
state 0 390 94
does 0 390 94
not 0 390 94
want 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
public 0 390 94
to 0 390 94
become 0 390 94
aware 0 390 94
of 0 390 94
will 0 390 94
keep 0 390 94
making 0 390 94
its 0 390 94
way 0 390 94
into 0 390 94
transparency. 0 390 94

Independent 0 390 95
media 0 390 95
will 0 390 95
continue 0 390 95
to 0 390 95
have 0 390 95
the 0 390 95
opportunity 0 390 95
to 0 390 95
share 0 390 95
information 0 390 95
because 1 390 95
of 1 390 95
a 1 390 95
lack 1 390 95
of 1 390 95
credible 1 390 95
information 1 390 95
and 1 390 95
plain 1 390 95
truth 1 390 95
within 1 390 95
the 1 390 95
mainstream. 1 390 95

People 0 390 96
are 0 390 96
hungry 0 390 96
for 0 390 96
it, 0 390 96
and 0 390 96
will 0 390 96
seek 0 390 96
it 0 390 96
out 0 390 96
themselves. 0 390 96

After 0 394 6
running 0 394 6
through 0 394 6
the 0 394 6
entire 0 394 6

it 0 394 6

The 0 394 10
three 0 394 10
goals 0 394 10
of 0 394 10
all 0 394 10
this 0 394 10
are 0 394 10
simple. 0 394 10

1. 0 394 11

Keep 0 394 12
the 0 394 12
media 0 394 12
happy 0 394 12
and 0 394 12
profitable 0 394 12

2. 0 394 13

Undermine 1 394 14
President 0 394 14
Trump 0 394 14
and 0 394 14
prevent 0 394 14
him 0 394 14
from 0 394 14

reforms. 0 394 14

3. 0 394 15

Punish 0 394 16
the 0 394 16
voting 0 394 16
public 0 394 16
for 0 394 16
electing 0 394 16
Trump 0 394 16

Never 0 394 17
underestimate 0 394 17
the 0 394 17
power 0 394 17
of 0 394 17
the 1 394 17
swamp's 1 394 17
spite. 1 394 17

Much 0 394 18
of 0 394 18
this 0 394 18
is 0 394 18
about 0 394 18
self-defense. 0 394 18

The 0 394 19
more 0 394 19
Trump 0 394 19
is 0 394 19
investigated, 0 394 19
the 0 394 19
less 0 394 19
he 0 394 19
can 0 394 19
investigate, 0 394 19
reform 0 394 19
or 0 394 19
implement 0 394 19
changes 0 394 19
to 0 394 19
the 0 394 19
swamp. 1 394 19

But 0 394 20
plenty 0 394 20
of 0 394 20
it 0 394 20
is 0 394 20
about 0 394 20
malice 1 394 20
and 1 394 20
spite. 1 394 20

Culture 0 394 21

Right, 0 405 23
except 0 405 23
she 0 405 23
does 0 405 23
just 0 405 23
that 0 405 23
and 0 405 23
so 0 405 23
do 0 405 23
many 0 405 23
in 0 405 23
her 0 405 23

However, 0 405 24
in 0 405 24
less 0 405 24
than 0 405 24
a 0 405 24
minute 0 405 24
she 0 405 24
would 0 405 24

skin 1 405 24
on 1 405 24
the 1 405 24

Swisher 0 405 25
asked 0 405 25
her, 0 405 25
"What 0 405 25
do 0 405 25
you 0 405 25
think 0 405 25
of 0 405 25
Cory 0 405 25
Booker… 0 405 25
saying 0 405 25
‘kick 1 405 25
them 1 405 25
in 1 405 25
the 1 405 25
shins,’ 1 405 25
essentially?" 0 405 25

Of 0 405 26
course, 0 405 26
Swisher 0 405 26
meant 0 405 26
Eric 0 405 26
Holder 0 405 26
and 0 405 26
Clinton 0 405 26
corrected 0 405 26
her, 0 405 26
adding, 0 405 26
“Yeah, 0 405 26
I 0 405 26
know 0 405 26
they 0 405 26
all 0 405 26
look 0 405 26
alike." 0 405 26

What 1 405 27
was 1 405 27
even 1 405 27
more 1 405 27
amazing 1 405 27
is 0 405 27
that 0 405 27
the 0 405 27
audience 0 405 27
laughed 0 405 27
hysterically. 0 405 27

Can 0 405 28
you 0 405 28
imagine 0 405 28
if 0 405 28
a 0 405 28
conservative 0 405 28
person 0 405 28
uttered 0 405 28
those 0 405 28
comments? 0 405 28

There 0 405 29
would 0 405 29
be 0 405 29
a 0 405 29
near 0 405 29
lynching 0 405 29
of 0 405 29
them 0 405 29
on 0 405 29
the 0 405 29
spot 0 405 29
and 0 405 29
surely 0 405 29
for 0 405 29
days 0 405 29
to 0 405 29
come. 0 405 29

They 0 405 30
might 0 405 30
lose 0 405 30
their 0 405 30
livelihood 0 405 30
and 0 405 30
get 0 405 30
death 0 405 30
threats, 0 405 30
but 0 405 30
not 0 405 30
"Crooked" 1 405 30
Hillary. 1 405 30

Clearly, 1 405 31
she 1 405 31
was 1 405 31
speaking 1 405 31
of 1 405 31
all 1 405 31
black 1 405 31
people 1 405 31
and 1 405 31
not 1 405 31
being 1 405 31
specific 1 405 31
to 1 405 31
Holder 1 405 31
or 1 405 31
Booker 1 405 31
as 1 405 31
they 1 405 31
look 1 405 31
nothing 1 405 31
alike. 1 405 31

The 0 405 32
only 0 405 32
thing 0 405 32
the 0 405 32
two 0 405 32
of 0 405 32
them 0 405 32
have 0 405 32
in 0 405 32
common 0 405 32
is 0 405 32
that 0 405 32
they 0 405 32
are 0 405 32
criminals 0 405 32
and 0 405 32
have 0 405 32
black 0 405 32
skin. 0 405 32

Clinton's 0 405 33
comments 0 405 33
were 0 405 33
clearly 0 405 33
racist, 0 405 33
and 0 405 33
those 0 405 33
fawning 0 405 33
over 0 405 33
her 0 405 33
during 0 405 33
the 0 405 33
interview 0 405 33
laughed 0 405 33
it 0 405 33
up 0 405 33
right 0 405 33
along 0 405 33
with 0 405 33
her. 0 405 33

take 0 405 34
a 0 405 34
look! 0 405 34

“That 0 406 20

up 0 406 20
there." 0 406 20

Additionally, 0 406 21

While 0 406 22
some 0 406 22

believe 0 406 22
that 0 406 22
Trump's 1 406 22
base 1 406 22
is 1 406 22
all 1 406 22
that 1 406 22
energized, 1 406 22
it 1 406 22
seems 1 406 22
pretty 1 406 22
energetic 1 406 22
to 1 406 22
me 1 406 22

only 1 406 22
furthered 1 406 22
their 1 406 22

at 1 406 22
the 1 406 22
establishment, 1 406 22
both 0 406 22

We're 0 406 23
just 0 406 23

seeing 0 406 23
how 0 406 23

turn 0 406 23
out. 0 406 23

There's 0 406 24
a 0 406 24
part 0 406 24
of 0 406 24
me 0 406 24
that 0 406 24
thinks 0 406 24
this 0 406 24
may 0 406 24
actually 0 406 24
turn 0 406 24
out 0 406 24

one 0 406 24

turnouts 0 406 24
for 0 406 24
a 0 406 24

that 0 406 24
we've 0 406 24
ever 0 406 24
seen, 0 406 24
but 0 406 24
that's 1 406 24
just 1 406 24
my 1 406 24

feeling. 1 406 24

On 0 406 25
Tuesday, 0 406 25
we'll 0 406 25
know 0 406 25
for 0 406 25

I 0 406 26
don't 0 406 26
know 0 406 26
about 0 406 26
you, 0 406 26
but 0 406 26
I 0 406 26

Currently, 0 424 38
two 0 424 38
groups 0 424 38
of 0 424 38
migrants, 0 424 38
according 0 424 38
to 0 424 38
various 0 424 38
estimates 0 424 38
numbering 0 424 38
up 0 424 38
to 0 424 38
6,500 0 424 38
people, 0 424 38
mainly 0 424 38
families, 0 424 38
are 0 424 38
heading 0 424 38
towards 0 424 38
the 0 424 38
US 0 424 38
through 0 424 38
Mexico. 0 424 38

Meanwhile, 0 424 39
a 0 424 39
third 0 424 39
caravan 0 424 39
of 0 424 39
migrants, 0 424 39
this 0 424 39
time 0 424 39
from 0 424 39
El 0 424 39
Salvador, 0 424 39
has 0 424 39
reportedly 0 424 39
already 0 424 39
crossed 0 424 39
into 0 424 39
Mexico. 0 424 39

At 0 424 40
the 0 424 40
same 0 424 40
time, 0 424 40
according 0 424 40
to 0 424 40
military 0 424 40
planning 0 424 40
documents, 0 424 40
the 0 424 40
majority 0 424 40
of 0 424 40
the 0 424 40
crowd 0 424 40
might 0 424 40

long 0 424 40
journey 0 424 40
to 0 424 40
the 0 424 40
US. 0 424 40

While 0 424 41
the 0 424 41
US 0 424 41
still 0 424 41
has 0 424 41
very 0 424 41
little 0 424 41
intel 0 424 41
about 0 424 41
the 0 424 41
composition 0 424 41
of 0 424 41
the 0 424 41
migrant 0 424 41

the 0 424 41
number 0 424 41
of 0 424 41
potential 0 424 41
illegals 0 424 41
and, 0 424 41
if 0 424 41
not, 0 424 41
suppress 1 424 41
them 1 424 41
with 1 424 41
brutal 1 424 41
force. 1 424 41

Currently, 0 424 42
Washington 0 424 42
has 0 424 42
allocated 0 424 42
roughly 0 424 42
the 0 424 42
same 0 424 42
number 0 424 42

of 0 428 18
understood 0 428 18
professional 0 428 18
norms, 0 428 18
and 0 428 18
we 0 428 18
believe 0 428 18
the 0 428 18
overwhelming 0 428 18
majority 0 428 18
of 0 428 18
journalists 0 428 18
covering 0 428 18
the 0 428 18
White 0 428 18
House 0 428 18
share 0 428 18
that 0 428 18
preference,” 0 428 18
Sanders 0 428 18
said. 0 428 18

“But, 0 428 19
given 0 428 19
the 0 428 19
position 0 428 19
taken 0 428 19
by 0 428 19
CNN, 0 428 19
we 0 428 19
now 0 428 19
feel 0 428 19
obligated 0 428 19
to 0 428 19
replace 0 428 19
previously 0 428 19
shared 0 428 19
practices 0 428 19
with 0 428 19
explicit 0 428 19
rules.” 0 428 19

Oh, 0 428 20
but 0 428 20
there's 0 428 20
more. 0 428 20

If 0 428 21
journalists 0 428 21
can't 0 428 21
conduct 0 428 21
themselves 0 428 21
according 0 428 21
to 0 428 21
these 0 428 21
rules, 0 428 21
then 0 428 21
there 0 428 21
is 0 428 21
no 0 428 21
other 0 428 21
option 0 428 21
but 0 428 21
to.... 0 428 21
write 0 428 21
more 0 428 21
explicit 0 428 21
rules! 0 428 21

Seriously! 1 428 22

“At 0 428 23
this 0 428 23
time, 0 428 23
however, 0 428 23
we 0 428 23
have 0 428 23
decided 0 428 23
not 0 428 23
to 0 428 23
frame 0 428 23
such 0 428 23
rules 0 428 23
in 0 428 23
the 0 428 23
hope 0 428 23
that 0 428 23
professional 0 428 23
journalistic 0 428 23
norms 0 428 23
will 0 428 23
suffice 0 428 23
to 0 428 23
regulate 0 428 23
conduct 0 428 23
in 0 428 23
those 0 428 23
places,” 0 428 23
Sanders 0 428 23
said. 0 428 23

“If 0 428 24
unprofessional 0 428 24
behavior 0 428 24
occurs 0 428 24
in 0 428 24
those 0 428 24

or 0 428 24
if 0 428 24
a 0 428 24
court 0 428 24
should 0 428 24
decide 0 428 24
that 0 428 24

are 0 428 24
required 0 428 24
to 0 428 24
regulate 0 428 24
conduct 0 428 24
there, 0 428 24
we 0 428 24
will 0 428 24
be 0 428 24
forced 0 428 24
to 0 428 24
reconsider 0 428 24
this 0 428 24
decision.” 0 428 24

The 0 428 25
White 0 428 25

should 0 428 25

they 0 428 25
are 0 428 25
trying 0 428 25

This 0 435 31
is 0 435 31
an 0 435 31
issue 0 435 31
of 0 435 31
privilege, 0 435 31
not 0 435 31

I 0 435 32
have 0 435 32
made 0 435 32
this 0 435 32
point 0 435 32
before 0 435 32

this 0 435 32
judge 0 435 32
apparently 0 435 32
doesn't 0 435 32
get 0 435 32
it. 0 435 32

I 0 435 33
want 0 435 33
my 0 435 33
White 0 435 33
House 0 435 33
press 0 435 33
pass! 0 435 33

So 0 435 34
does 0 435 34
Infowars. 0 435 34

Will 0 435 35
Judge 0 435 35
Kelly 0 435 35
demand 0 435 35
the 0 435 35
White 0 435 35

provide 0 435 35
us 0 435 35
with 0 435 35
one 0 435 35
as 0 435 35
a 0 435 35
"right"? 0 435 35

Nope, 0 435 36
not 0 435 36
gonna 0 435 36
happen. 0 435 36

Because 0 435 37
it's 0 435 37
not 0 435 37
a 0 435 37
right. 0 435 37

Yet, 0 435 38
this 0 435 38
judge 0 435 38
orders 0 435 38
the 0 435 38
White 0 435 38

to 0 435 38
restore 0 435 38

Give 0 435 39
me 0 435 39
a 0 435 39

Acosta's 0 435 40

Amendment 0 435 40

weren't 0 435 40

either. 0 435 40

Furthermore, 0 435 41
the 0 435 41

did 0 435 41

“Today, 0 435 62
the 0 435 62

In 0 435 63

we 0 435 63

There 0 435 65
must 0 435 65

from 0 435 68
now 0 435 68

a 0 441 2

It 0 441 3
just 0 441 3

some 0 441 5
new 0 441 5
ideas 0 441 5
on 0 441 5
how 0 441 5

of 0 441 6
the 0 441 6
things 0 441 6
we’ll 0 441 6
do 0 441 6

maybe 0 441 6
turn 0 441 6
the 0 441 6
camera 0 441 6
off 0 441 6
that 0 441 6

them, 0 441 6
because 0 441 6
then 0 441 6
they 0 441 6
don’t 0 441 6
have 0 441 6
any 0 441 6
air 0 441 6

probably 0 441 6

maybe, 0 441 6
you 0 441 6
know, 0 441 6

Acosta’s 0 441 10

interacting 0 441 11
with 0 441 11
President 0 441 11
Trump 0 441 11
– 0 441 11
Acosta 0 441 11
said 0 441 11
he 0 441 11
wanted 0 441 11
to 0 441 11
“challenge” 0 441 11
him 0 441 11
on 0 441 11
calling 0 441 11

the 0 441 11

upon 0 441 11
another 0 441 11

to 0 441 11
speak. 0 441 11

After 0 441 12
lecturing 0 441 12
Trump, 0 441 12
Acosta 0 441 12
belligerently 1 441 12
refused 0 441 12
to 0 441 12
yield 0 441 12
the 0 441 12
microphone 0 441 12
to 0 441 12
a 0 441 12
White 0 441 12

staffer 0 441 12
and 0 441 12
pushed 0 441 12
her 0 441 12
arm 0 441 12
away 0 441 12
as 0 441 12
she 0 441 12

all 0 441 12
of 0 441 12

Kelly 0 441 13
of 0 441 13
Washington, 0 441 13

who 0 441 13
was 0 441 13
appointed 0 441 13
by 0 441 13
Trump, 0 441 13
ruled 0 441 13
against 0 441 13
the 0 441 13
administration 0 441 13
and 0 441 13
ordered 0 441 13
Acosta’s 0 441 13

further 0 441 13
hearings 0 441 13
in 0 441 13
the 0 441 13
lawsuit. 0 441 13

But 0 441 14
it 0 441 14
was 0 441 14
not 0 441 14
a 0 441 14
vindication 0 441 14
of 0 441 14

The 0 441 15
judge 0 441 15

said 0 441 15
that 0 441 15
the 0 441 15

not 0 441 15
yet 0 441 15
been 0 441 15
adjudicated 0 441 15
and 0 441 15
added 0 441 15
that 0 441 15
the 0 441 15
president 0 441 15
was 0 441 15
free 0 441 15
not 0 441 15

The 0 441 16
temporary 0 441 16

according 0 441 16
to 0 441 16
media 0 441 16
reports, 0 441 16
Kelly 0 441 16
found 0 441 16
that 0 441 16
the 0 441 16

said 0 441 18
the 0 441 18

ignorantly 1 441 21
blathered 1 441 21
on 0 441 21

quickly 1 442 3
– 1 442 3

very 1 442 3
quietly 1 442 3

The 1 442 7
Guardian’s 1 442 7
latest 1 442 7
story 1 442 7
provides 1 442 7
a 1 442 7
supposedly 1 442 7
stronger 1 442 7
foundation 1 442 7
for 1 442 7
an 1 442 7
existing 1 442 7
narrative: 1 442 7
that 1 442 7
Assange 1 442 7
and 1 442 7
Wikileaks 1 442 7
knowingly 1 442 7
published 1 442 7
emails 1 442 7
hacked 1 442 7
by 1 442 7
Russia 1 442 7
from 1 442 7
the 1 442 7
Democratic 1 442 7
party’s 1 442 7
servers. 1 442 7

In 1 442 8
truth, 1 442 8
there 1 442 8
is 1 442 8
no 1 442 8
public 1 442 8
evidence 1 442 8
that 1 442 8
the 1 442 8
emails 1 442 8
were 1 442 8
hacked, 1 442 8
or 1 442 8
that 1 442 8
Russia 1 442 8
was 1 442 8
involved. 1 442 8

Central 1 442 9
actors 1 442 9
have 1 442 9
suggested 1 442 9
instead 1 442 9
that 1 442 9
the 1 442 9
emails 1 442 9
were 1 442 9
leaked 1 442 9
from 1 442 9
within 1 442 9
the 1 442 9
Democratic 1 442 9
party. 1 442 9

Nonetheless, 0 442 10
this 0 442 10
unverified 0 442 10
allegation 0 442 10
has 0 442 10
been 0 442 10
aggressively 1 442 10
exploited 1 442 10
by 0 442 10
the 0 442 10
Democratic 0 442 10
leadership 0 442 10
because 0 442 10
it 0 442 10
shifts 0 442 10
attention 0 442 10
away 0 442 10
both 0 442 10
from 0 442 10
its 0 442 10
failure 0 442 10
to 0 442 10
mount 0 442 10
an 0 442 10
effective 0 442 10
electoral 0 442 10
challenge 0 442 10
to 0 442 10

the 0 442 10
damaging 0 442 10
contents 0 442 10
of 0 442 10
the 0 442 10

These 0 442 11
show 0 442 11
that 0 442 11
party 0 442 11
bureaucrats 0 442 11
sought 0 442 11
to 0 442 11
rig 0 442 11
the 0 442 11
primaries 0 442 11
to 0 442 11
make 0 442 11
sure 0 442 11
Clinton’s 0 442 11
challenger 0 442 11
for 0 442 11
the 0 442 11
Democratic 0 442 11
nomination, 0 442 11

To 0 442 12
underscore 0 442 12
the 0 442 12
intended 0 442 12
effect 0 442 12
of 0 442 12
the 0 442 12

new 0 442 12
claims, 0 442 12
Harding 0 442 12
even 0 442 12
throws 0 442 12
in 0 442 12
a 0 442 12
casual 0 442 12
and 0 442 12
unsubstantiated 0 442 12
reference 0 442 12
to 0 442 12
“Russians” 1 442 12
joining 0 442 12

supposedly 0 442 12
meeting 0 442 12

Manafort 0 442 13
has 0 442 13
denied 0 442 13
the 0 442 13
Guardian’s 0 442 13
claims, 0 442 13
while 0 442 13

threatened 0 442 13

‘Responsible 0 442 14

The 0 442 15
emotional 0 442 15
impact 0 442 15
of 0 442 15
the 0 442 15
Guardian 0 442 15
story 0 442 15
is 0 442 15
to 0 442 15
suggest 0 442 15
that 0 442 15
Assange 0 442 15
is 0 442 15
responsible 0 442 15
for 0 442 15
four 0 442 15

But 0 442 16
more 0 442 16
significantly, 0 442 16
it 0 442 16
bolsters 0 442 16
the 0 442 16

that 0 442 16

a 0 442 16
publisher 0 442 16

and 0 442 16
thereby 0 442 16
entitled 0 442 16
to 0 442 16
the 0 442 16
protections 0 442 16
of 0 442 16
a 0 442 16

the 0 442 16
New 0 442 16

but 0 442 16
the 1 442 16
head 1 442 16
of 1 442 16
an 1 442 16
organisation 1 442 16

in 1 442 16

for 1 442 16
a 1 442 16
foreign 1 442 16

The 0 442 17
intention 0 442 17
is 0 442 17
to 0 442 17
deeply 0 442 17
discredit 0 442 17
Assange, 0 442 17
and 0 442 17
by 0 442 17
extension 0 442 17
the 0 442 17
Wikileaks 0 442 17
organisation, 0 442 17
in 0 442 17
the 0 442 17
eyes 0 442 17
of 0 442 17
right-thinking 0 442 17
liberals. 0 442 17

That, 0 442 18
in 0 442 18
turn, 0 442 18
will 0 442 18
make 0 442 18
it 0 442 18
much 0 442 18
easier 0 442 18
to 0 442 18
silence 0 442 18
Assange 0 442 18
and 0 442 18
the 0 442 18
vital 0 442 18
cause 0 442 18
he 0 442 18
represents: 0 442 18
the 0 442 18
use 0 442 18

corporate 0 442 18

political 0 442 18

through 0 442 18
the 0 442 18

of 0 442 18

greater 0 442 18

The 0 442 19
Guardian 0 442 19

will 0 442 19
prepare 0 442 19
public 0 442 19
opinion 0 442 19
for 0 442 19
the 0 442 19
moment 0 442 19

Assange 0 442 19
out 0 442 19
of 0 442 19
the 0 442 19

having 0 442 19
already 0 442 19

to 0 442 19

It 0 442 20
will 0 442 20
soften 0 442 20
opposition 0 442 20
when 0 442 20
the 0 442 20

it 0 442 21

that 0 442 22
avoiding 0 442 22
this 0 442 22

the 0 442 22

Assange 0 442 22

asylum 0 442 22
in 0 442 22

that 1 442 23

problem 1 442 28
for 1 442 28

which 1 442 28
should 1 442 28
have 1 442 28
been 1 442 28
obvious 1 442 28
to 1 442 28
its 1 442 28
editors 1 442 28
from 1 442 28
the 1 442 28
outset, 1 442 28
is 1 442 28
that 1 442 28
any 1 442 28
visits 1 442 28
by 1 442 28
Manafort 1 442 28
would 1 442 28
be 1 442 28
easily 1 442 28
verifiable 1 442 28
without 1 442 28

far 0 442 29
from 0 442 29
alone 0 442 29
in 0 442 29
noting 0 442 29
that 0 442 29
London 0 442 29
is 0 442 29
possibly 0 442 29
the 0 442 29
most 0 442 29
surveilled 0 442 29
city 0 442 29

environs 0 442 30
of 0 442 30
the 0 442 30
Ecuadorian 0 442 30
embassy 0 442 30
are 0 442 30
monitored 0 442 30
especially 0 442 30
heavily, 0 442 30
with 0 442 30
continuous 0 442 30
filming 0 442 30
by 0 442 30
the 0 442 30
UK 0 442 30
and 0 442 30
Ecuadorian 0 442 30
authorities 0 442 30

most 0 442 30
likely 0 442 30
by 0 442 30
the 0 442 30

an 0 442 30
interest 0 442 30
in 0 442 30
Assange’s 0 442 30
fate. 0 442 30

The 0 442 31
idea 0 442 31
that 0 442 31
Manafort 0 442 31
or 0 442 31
“Russians” 1 442 31
could 0 442 31
have 0 442 31
wandered 0 442 31
into 0 442 31
the 0 442 31
embassy 0 442 31
to 0 442 31
meet 0 442 31
Assange 0 442 31
even 0 442 31
once 0 442 31
without 0 442 31
their 0 442 31
trail, 0 442 31
entry 0 442 31
and 0 442 31
meeting 0 442 31
being 0 442 31
intimately 0 442 31
scrutinised 0 442 31
and 0 442 31
recorded 0 442 31
is 0 442 31
simply 1 442 31
preposterous. 1 442 31

According 1 442 32
to 1 442 32
Greenwald: 1 442 32
“If 1 442 32
Paul 1 442 32
Manafort 1 442 32
… 1 442 32
visited 1 442 32
Assange 1 442 32
at 1 442 32
the 1 442 32
Embassy, 1 442 32
there 1 442 32
would 1 442 32
be 1 442 32
ample 1 442 32
amounts 1 442 32
of 1 442 32
video 1 442 32
and 1 442 32
other 1 442 32
photographic 1 442 32
proof 1 442 32
demonstrating 1 442 32
that 1 442 32
this 1 442 32
happened. 1 442 32

The 1 442 33
Guardian 1 442 33
provides 1 442 33
none 1 442 33
of 1 442 33
that.” 1 442 33

any 0 442 34
visitor 0 442 34
to 0 442 34
Assange 0 442 34
must 0 442 34
submit. 0 442 34

Any 0 442 35
visits 0 442 35

would 0 442 35
have 0 442 35
been 0 442 35
logged. 0 442 35

In 1 442 36
fact, 1 442 36
the 1 442 36
Guardian 1 442 36
obtained 1 442 36
the 1 442 36
embassy’s 1 442 36

in 1 442 36
May, 1 442 36

either 1 442 36

It 1 442 37
did 1 442 37
not 1 442 37
refer 1 442 37
to 1 442 37
the 1 442 37

in 1 442 37
its 1 442 37
latest 1 442 37

Murray: 0 442 38

The 0 442 39
problem 0 442 39
with 0 442 39
this 1 442 39
latest 1 442 39
fabrication 1 442 39
is 0 442 39
that 0 442 39
[Ecuador’s 0 442 39
President] 0 442 39
Moreno 0 442 39
had 0 442 39
already 0 442 39
released 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
visitor 0 442 39
logs 0 442 39
to 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
Mueller 0 442 39
inquiry. 0 442 39

Neither 0 442 40
Manafort 0 442 40
nor 0 442 40
these 0 442 40
“Russians” 1 442 40
are 0 442 40
in 0 442 40
the 0 442 40
visitor 0 442 40
logs 0 442 40
… 0 442 40
What 0 442 40
possible 0 442 40
motive 0 442 40
would 0 442 40
the 0 442 40
Ecuadorean 0 442 40
government 0 442 40
have 0 442 40
for 0 442 40
facilitating 0 442 40
secret 0 442 40
unrecorded 0 442 40
visits 0 442 40
by 0 442 40
Paul 0 442 40
Manafort? 0 442 40

Furthermore 0 442 41
it 0 442 41
is 0 442 41
impossible 0 442 41
that 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
intelligence 0 442 41
agency 0 442 41
– 0 442 41
who 0 442 41
were 0 442 41
in 0 442 41
charge 0 442 41
of 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
security 0 442 41

not 0 442 41
know 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
identity 0 442 41
of 0 442 41
these 0 442 41
alleged 0 442 41
“Russians”. 1 442 41

No 1 442 42
fact-checking 1 442 42

It 1 442 43
is 1 442 43
worth 1 442 43
noting 1 442 43
it 1 442 43
should 1 442 43
be 1 442 43
vitally 1 442 43
important 1 442 43
for 1 442 43
a 1 442 43
serious 1 442 43
publication 1 442 43
like 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
Guardian 1 442 43
to 1 442 43
ensure 1 442 43
its 1 442 43
claims 1 442 43
are 1 442 43
unassailably 1 442 43
true 1 442 43
– 1 442 43
both 1 442 43
because 1 442 43
Assange’s 1 442 43
personal 1 442 43
fate 1 442 43
rests 1 442 43
on 1 442 43
their 1 442 43
veracity, 1 442 43
and 1 442 43
because, 1 442 43
even 1 442 43
more 1 442 43
importantly, 1 442 43
a 1 442 43
fundamental 1 442 43
right, 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
freedom 1 442 43
of 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
press, 1 442 43
is 1 442 43
at 1 442 43
stake. 1 442 43

Given 1 442 44
this, 1 442 44
one 1 442 44
would 1 442 44
have 1 442 44
expected 1 442 44
the 1 442 44
Guardian’s 1 442 44
editors 1 442 44
to 1 442 44
have 1 442 44
insisted 1 442 44
on 1 442 44
the 1 442 44
most 1 442 44
stringent 1 442 44
checks 1 442 44
imaginable 1 442 44
before 1 442 44
going 1 442 44
to 1 442 44
press 1 442 44
with 1 442 44
Harding’s 1 442 44
story. 1 442 44

At 1 442 45
a 1 442 45
very 1 442 45
minimum, 1 442 45
they 1 442 45
should 1 442 45
have 1 442 45
sought 1 442 45
out 1 442 45
a 1 442 45
response 1 442 45
from 1 442 45
Assange 1 442 45
and 1 442 45
Manafort 1 442 45
before 1 442 45
publication. 1 442 45

Neither 1 442 46
precaution 1 442 46
was 1 442 46
taken. 1 442 46

I 1 442 47
worked 1 442 47
for 1 442 47
the 1 442 47
Guardian 1 442 47
for 1 442 47
a 1 442 47
number 1 442 47
of 1 442 47
years, 1 442 47
and 1 442 47
know 1 442 47
well 1 442 47
the 1 442 47
layers 1 442 47
of 1 442 47
checks 1 442 47
that 1 442 47
any 1 442 47
highly 1 442 47
sensitive 1 442 47
story 1 442 47
has 1 442 47
to 1 442 47
go 1 442 47
through 1 442 47
before 1 442 47
publication. 1 442 47

In 1 442 48
that 1 442 48
lengthy 1 442 48
process, 1 442 48
a 1 442 48
variety 1 442 48
of 1 442 48
commissioning 1 442 48
editors, 1 442 48
lawyers, 1 442 48
backbench 1 442 48
editors 1 442 48
and 1 442 48
the 1 442 48
editor 1 442 48
herself, 1 442 48
Kath 1 442 48
Viner, 1 442 48
would 1 442 48
normally 1 442 48
insist 1 442 48
on 1 442 48
cuts 1 442 48
to 1 442 48
anything 1 442 48
that 1 442 48
could 1 442 48
not 1 442 48
be 1 442 48
rigorously 1 442 48
defended 1 442 48
and 1 442 48
corroborated. 1 442 48

And 1 442 49
yet 1 442 49
this 1 442 49
piece 1 442 49
seems 1 442 49
to 1 442 49
have 1 442 49
been 1 442 49
casually 1 442 49
waved 1 442 49
through, 1 442 49
given 1 442 49
a 1 442 49
green 1 442 49
light 1 442 49
even 1 442 49
though 1 442 49
its 1 442 49
profound 1 442 49
shortcomings 1 442 49
were 1 442 49
evident 1 442 49
to 1 442 49
a 1 442 49
range 1 442 49
of 1 442 49
well-placed 1 442 49
analysts 1 442 49
and 1 442 49
journalists 1 442 49
from 1 442 49
the 1 442 49
outset. 1 442 49

That 0 442 50
at 0 442 50
the 0 442 50
very 0 442 50
least 0 442 50
hints 0 442 50
that 0 442 50
the 0 442 50
Guardian 0 442 50
thought 0 442 50
they 0 442 50
had 0 442 50
“insurance” 0 442 50
on 0 442 50
this 0 442 50
story. 0 442 50

And 0 442 51
the 0 442 51
only 0 442 51
people 0 442 51
who 0 442 51
could 0 442 51
have 0 442 51
promised 0 442 51
that 0 442 51
kind 0 442 51
of 0 442 51
insurance 0 442 51
are 0 442 51
the 0 442 51
security 0 442 51
and 0 442 51
intelligence 0 442 51
services 0 442 51
– 0 442 51
presumably 0 442 51
of 0 442 51
Britain, 0 442 51
the 0 442 51
United 0 442 51
States 0 442 51
and 0 442 51
/ 0 442 51
or 0 442 51
Ecuador. 0 442 51

It 1 442 52
appears 1 442 52
the 1 442 52
Guardian 1 442 52
has 1 442 52
simply 1 442 52
taken 1 442 52
this 1 442 52
story, 1 442 52
provided 1 442 52
by 1 442 52
spooks, 1 442 52
at 1 442 52
face 1 442 52
value. 1 442 52

Even 1 442 53
if 1 442 53
it 1 442 53
later 1 442 53
turns 1 442 53
out 1 442 53
that 1 442 53
Manafort 1 442 53
did 1 442 53
visit 1 442 53
Assange, 1 442 53
the 1 442 53
Guardian 1 442 53
clearly 1 442 53
had 1 442 53
no 1 442 53
compelling 1 442 53
evidence 1 442 53
for 1 442 53
its 1 442 53
claims 1 442 53
when 1 442 53
it 1 442 53
published 1 442 53
them. 1 442 53

That 1 442 54
is 1 442 54
profoundly 1 442 54
irresponsible 1 442 54
journalism 1 442 54
– 1 442 54
fake 1 442 54
news 1 442 54
– 1 442 54
that 1 442 54
should 1 442 54
be 1 442 54
of 1 442 54
the 1 442 54
gravest 1 442 54
concern 1 442 54
to 1 442 54
readers. 1 442 54

A 0 442 55
pattern, 0 442 55
not 0 442 55
an 0 442 55
aberration 0 442 55

Despite 1 442 56
all 1 442 56
this, 1 442 56
even 1 442 56
analysts 1 442 56
critical 1 442 56
of 1 442 56
the 1 442 56
Guardian’s 1 442 56
behaviour 1 442 56
have 1 442 56
shown 1 442 56
a 1 442 56
glaring 1 442 56
failure 1 442 56
to 1 442 56
understand 1 442 56
that 1 442 56
its 1 442 56
latest 1 442 56
coverage 1 442 56
represents 1 442 56
not 1 442 56
an 1 442 56
aberration 1 442 56
by 1 442 56
the 1 442 56
paper 1 442 56
but 1 442 56
decisively 1 442 56
fits 1 442 56
with 1 442 56
a 1 442 56
pattern. 1 442 56

Glenn 0 442 57
Greenwald, 0 442 57
who 0 442 57
once 0 442 57
had 0 442 57
an 0 442 57
influential 0 442 57
column 0 442 57
in 0 442 57
the 0 442 57
Guardian 0 442 57
until 0 442 57
an 0 442 57
apparent, 0 442 57
though 0 442 57
unacknowledged, 0 442 57
falling 0 442 57
out 0 442 57
with 0 442 57
his 0 442 57
employer 0 442 57
over 0 442 57
the 0 442 57
Edward 0 442 57
Snowden 0 442 57
revelations, 0 442 57
wrote 0 442 57
a 0 442 57
series 0 442 57
of 0 442 57
baffling 1 442 57
observations 1 442 57
about 0 442 57
the 0 442 57
Guardian’s 0 442 57
latest 0 442 57
story. 0 442 57

First, 0 442 58
he 0 442 58
suggested 0 442 58
it 0 442 58
was 0 442 58
simply 0 442 58
evidence 0 442 58
of 0 442 58
the 0 442 58
Guardian’s 0 442 58
long-standing 1 442 58
(and 1 442 58
well-documented) 1 442 58
hostility 1 442 58
towards 1 442 58
Assange. 1 442 58

“The 1 442 59
Guardian, 1 442 59
an 1 442 59
otherwise 1 442 59
solid 1 442 59
and 1 442 59
reliable 1 442 59
paper, 1 442 59
has 1 442 59
such 1 442 59
a 1 442 59
pervasive 1 442 59
and 1 442 59
unprofessionally 1 442 59
personal 1 442 59
hatred 1 442 59
for 1 442 59
Julian 1 442 59
Assange 1 442 59
that 1 442 59
it 1 442 59
has 1 442 59
frequently 1 442 59
dispensed 1 442 59
with 1 442 59
all 1 442 59
journalistic 1 442 59
standards 1 442 59
in 1 442 59
order 1 442 59
to 1 442 59
malign 1 442 59
him.” 1 442 59

It 1 442 60
was 1 442 60
also 1 442 60
apparently 1 442 60
evidence 1 442 60
of 1 442 60
the 1 442 60
paper’s 1 442 60
clickbait 1 442 60
tendencies: 1 442 60

“They 1 442 61
[Guardian 1 442 61
editors] 1 442 61
knew 1 442 61
that 1 442 61
publishing 1 442 61
this 1 442 61
story 1 442 61
would 1 442 61
cause 1 442 61
partisan 1 442 61
warriors 1 442 61
to 1 442 61
excitedly 1 442 61
spread 1 442 61
the 1 442 61
story, 1 442 61
and 1 442 61
that 1 442 61
cable 1 442 61
news 1 442 61
outlets 1 442 61
would 1 442 61
hyperventilate 1 442 61
over 1 442 61
it, 1 442 61
and 1 442 61
that 1 442 61
they’d 1 442 61
reap 1 442 61
the 1 442 61
rewards 1 442 61
regardless 1 442 61
of 1 442 61
whether 1 442 61
the 1 442 61
story 1 442 61
turned 1 442 61
out 1 442 61
to 1 442 61
be 1 442 61
true 1 442 61
or 1 442 61
false.” 1 442 61

And 0 442 62
finally, 0 442 62
in 0 442 62
a 1 442 62
bizarre 1 442 62
tweet, 1 442 62
Greenwald 0 442 62
opined, 0 442 62
“I 0 442 62
hope 0 442 62
the 0 442 62
story 0 442 62
[maligning 0 442 62
Assange] 0 442 62
turns 0 442 62
out 0 442 62
true” 0 442 62
– 0 442 62
apparently 1 442 62
because 1 442 62
maintenance 1 442 62
of 1 442 62
the 1 442 62
Guardian’s 1 442 62
reputation 1 442 62
is 1 442 62
more 1 442 62
important 1 442 62
than 1 442 62
Assange’s 1 442 62
fate 1 442 62
and 1 442 62
the 1 442 62
right 1 442 62
of 1 442 62
journalists 1 442 62
to 1 442 62
dig 1 442 62
up 1 442 62
embarrassing 1 442 62
secrets 1 442 62
without 1 442 62
fear 1 442 62
of 1 442 62
being 1 442 62
imprisoned. 1 442 62

I 0 442 63
think 0 442 63
the 0 442 63
Guardian 0 442 63
is 0 442 63
an 0 442 63
important 0 442 63
paper 0 442 63
with 0 442 63
great 0 442 63
journalists. 0 442 63

I 0 442 64
hope 0 442 64
the 0 442 64
story 0 442 64
turns 0 442 64
out 0 442 64
true. 0 442 64

But 0 442 65
the 0 442 65
skepticism 0 442 65
over 0 442 65
this 0 442 65
story 0 442 65
is 0 442 65
very 0 442 65
widespread, 0 442 65
including 0 442 65
among 0 442 65
Assange's 1 442 65
most 1 442 65
devoted 1 442 65
haters, 1 442 65
because 0 442 65
it's 0 442 65
so 0 442 65
sketchy. 0 442 65

If 0 442 66
Manafort 0 442 66
went 0 442 66
there, 0 442 66
there's 0 442 66
video. 0 442 66

it. 0 442 67

Deeper 0 442 69
malaise 0 442 69

What 0 442 70
this 0 442 70
misses 0 442 70
is 0 442 70
that 0 442 70
the 0 442 70
Guardian’s 0 442 70
attacks 0 442 70
on 0 442 70
Assange 0 442 70
are 0 442 70
not 0 442 70
exceptional 0 442 70
or 0 442 70
motivated 0 442 70
solely 0 442 70
by 0 442 70
personal 0 442 70
animosity. 0 442 70

They 0 442 71
are 0 442 71
entirely 0 442 71
predictable 0 442 71
and 0 442 71
systematic. 0 442 71

Rather 1 442 72
than 1 442 72
being 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
reason 1 442 72
for 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
Guardian 1 442 72
violating 1 442 72
basic 1 442 72
journalistic 1 442 72
standards 1 442 72
and 1 442 72
ethics, 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
paper’s 1 442 72
hatred 1 442 72
of 1 442 72
Assange 1 442 72
is 1 442 72
a 1 442 72
symptom 1 442 72
of 1 442 72
a 1 442 72
deeper 1 442 72
malaise 1 442 72
in 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
Guardian 1 442 72
and 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
wider 1 442 72
corporate 1 442 72
media. 1 442 72

Even 1 442 73
aside 1 442 73
from 1 442 73
its 1 442 73
decade-long 1 442 73
campaign 1 442 73
against 1 442 73
Assange, 1 442 73
the 1 442 73
Guardian 1 442 73
is 1 442 73
far 1 442 73
from 1 442 73
“solid 1 442 73
and 1 442 73
reliable”, 1 442 73
as 1 442 73
Greenwald 1 442 73
claims. 1 442 73

It 1 442 74
has 1 442 74
been 1 442 74
at 1 442 74
the 1 442 74
forefront 1 442 74
of 1 442 74
the 1 442 74
relentless, 1 442 74
and 1 442 74
unhinged, 1 442 74
attacks 1 442 74
on 1 442 74
Labour 1 442 74
leader 1 442 74
Jeremy 1 442 74
Corbyn 1 442 74
for 1 442 74
prioritising 1 442 74
the 1 442 74
rights 1 442 74
of 1 442 74
Palestinians 1 442 74
over 1 442 74

right 1 442 74
to 1 442 74
continue 1 442 74
its 1 442 74
belligerent 1 442 74
occupation. 1 442 74

Over 1 442 75
the 1 442 75
past 1 442 75
three 1 442 75
years, 1 442 75
the 1 442 75
Guardian 1 442 75
has 1 442 75
injected 1 442 75
credibility 1 442 75
into 1 442 75
the 1 442 75
Israel 1 442 75
lobby’s 1 442 75
desperate 1 442 75
efforts 1 442 75
to 1 442 75
tar 1 442 75
Corbyn 1 442 75
as 1 442 75

anti-semite. 1 442 75

See 0 442 76
here, 0 442 76
here 0 442 76
and 0 442 76
here. 0 442 76

Similarly, 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
Guardian 1 442 77
worked 1 442 77
tirelessly 1 442 77
to 1 442 77
promote 1 442 77

another 1 442 77
reason 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
paper 1 442 77
has 1 442 77
been 1 442 77
so 1 442 77
assiduous 1 442 77
in 1 442 77
promoting 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
idea 1 442 77
that 1 442 77
Assange, 1 442 77
aided 1 442 77
by 1 442 77
Russia, 1 442 77
was 1 442 77

coverage 1 442 78
of 1 442 78
Latin 1 442 78
America, 1 442 78
especially 1 442 78
of 1 442 78
populist 1 442 78
leftwing 1 442 78
governments 1 442 78
that 1 442 78
have 1 442 78
rebelled 1 442 78
against 1 442 78
traditional 1 442 78
and 1 442 78
oppressive 1 442 78
US 1 442 78
hegemony 1 442 78
in 1 442 78
the 1 442 78
region, 1 442 78
has 1 442 78
long 1 442 78
grated 1 442 78
with 1 442 78
analysts 1 442 78
and 1 442 78
experts. 1 442 78

Its 1 442 79
especial 1 442 79
venom 1 442 79
has 1 442 79
been 1 442 79
reserved 1 442 79
for 1 442 79
leftwing 1 442 79
figures 1 442 79
like 1 442 79
Venezuela’s 1 442 79
Hugo 1 442 79
Chavez, 1 442 79
democratically 1 442 79
elected 1 442 79
but 1 442 79
official 1 442 79
enemies 1 442 79
of 1 442 79
the 1 442 79

rather 1 442 79
than 1 442 79
the 1 442 79
region’s 1 442 79
rightwing 1 442 79
authoritarians 1 442 79
beloved 1 442 79
of 1 442 79
Washington. 1 442 79

The 1 442 80
Guardian 1 442 80
has 1 442 80
been 1 442 80
vocal 1 442 80
in 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
so-called 1 442 80
“fake 1 442 80
news” 1 442 80
hysteria, 1 442 80
decrying 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
influence 1 442 80
of 1 442 80
social 1 442 80
media, 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
only 1 442 80
place 1 442 80
where 1 442 80
leftwing 1 442 80
dissidents 1 442 80
have 1 442 80
managed 1 442 80
to 1 442 80
find 1 442 80
a 1 442 80
small 1 442 80
foothold 1 442 80
to 1 442 80
promote 1 442 80
their 1 442 80
politics 1 442 80
and 1 442 80
counter 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
corporate 1 442 80
media 1 442 80
narrative. 1 442 80

The 1 442 81
Guardian 1 442 81
has 1 442 81
painted 1 442 81
social 1 442 81
media 1 442 81
chiefly 1 442 81
as 1 442 81
a 1 442 81
platform 1 442 81
overrun 1 442 81
by 1 442 81
Russian 1 442 81
trolls, 1 442 81
arguing 1 442 81
that 1 442 81
this 1 442 81
should 1 442 81
justify 1 442 81
ever-tighter 1 442 81
restrictions 1 442 81
that 1 442 81
have 1 442 81
so 1 442 81
far 1 442 81
curbed 1 442 81
critical 1 442 81
voices 1 442 81
of 1 442 81
the 1 442 81
dissident 1 442 81
left 1 442 81
more 1 442 81
than 1 442 81
the 1 442 81
right. 1 442 81

Heroes 0 442 82
of 0 442 82
the 0 442 82
neoliberal 0 442 82
order 0 442 82

Equally, 1 442 83
the 1 442 83
Guardian 1 442 83
has 1 442 83
made 1 442 83
clear 1 442 83
who 1 442 83
its 1 442 83
true 1 442 83
heroes 1 442 83
are. 1 442 83

Certainly 1 442 84
not 1 442 84
Corbyn 1 442 84
or 1 442 84
Assange, 1 442 84
who 1 442 84
threaten 1 442 84
to 1 442 84
disrupt 1 442 84
the 1 442 84
entrenched 1 442 84
neoliberal 1 442 84
order 1 442 84
that 1 442 84
is 1 442 84
hurtling 1 442 84
us 1 442 84
towards 1 442 84
climate 1 442 84
breakdown 1 442 84
and 1 442 84
economic 1 442 84
collapse. 1 442 84

Its 1 442 85
pages, 1 442 85
however, 1 442 85
are 1 442 85
readily 1 442 85
available 1 442 85
to 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
latest 1 442 85
effort 1 442 85
to 1 442 85
prop 1 442 85
up 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
status 1 442 85
quo 1 442 85
from 1 442 85
Tony 1 442 85
Blair, 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
man 1 442 85
who 1 442 85
led 1 442 85
Britain, 1 442 85
on 1 442 85
false 1 442 85
pretences, 1 442 85
into 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
largest 1 442 85
crime 1 442 85
against 1 442 85
humanity 1 442 85
in 1 442 85
living 1 442 85
memory 1 442 85
– 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
attack 1 442 85
on 1 442 85
Iraq. 1 442 85

That 1 442 86
“humanitarian 1 442 86
intervention” 1 442 86
cost 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
lives 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
many 1 442 86
hundreds 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
thousands 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
Iraqis 1 442 86
and 1 442 86
created 1 442 86
a 1 442 86
vacuum 1 442 86
that 1 442 86
destabilised 1 442 86
much 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
Middle 1 442 86
East, 1 442 86
sucked 1 442 86
in 1 442 86
Islamic 1 442 86
jihadists 1 442 86
like 1 442 86
al-Qaeda 1 442 86
and 1 442 86
ISIS, 1 442 86
and 1 442 86
contributed 1 442 86
to 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
migrant 1 442 86
crisis 1 442 86
in 1 442 86
Europe 1 442 86
that 1 442 86
has 1 442 86
fuelled 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
resurgence 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
far-right. 1 442 86

None 1 442 87
of 1 442 87
that 1 442 87
is 1 442 87
discussed 1 442 87
in 1 442 87
the 1 442 87
Guardian 1 442 87
or 1 442 87
considered 1 442 87
grounds 1 442 87
for 1 442 87
disqualifying 1 442 87
Blair 1 442 87
as 1 442 87
an 1 442 87
arbiter 1 442 87
of 1 442 87
what 1 442 87
is 1 442 87
good 1 442 87
for 1 442 87
Britain 1 442 87
and 1 442 87
the 1 442 87
world’s 1 442 87
future. 1 442 87

The 1 442 88
Guardian 1 442 88
also 1 442 88
has 1 442 88
an 1 442 88
especial 1 442 88
soft 1 442 88
spot 1 442 88
for 1 442 88
blogger 1 442 88
Elliot 1 442 88
Higgins, 1 442 88
who, 1 442 88
aided 1 442 88
by 1 442 88
the 1 442 88
Guardian, 1 442 88
has 1 442 88
shot 1 442 88
to 1 442 88
unlikely 1 442 88
prominence 1 442 88
as 1 442 88
a 1 442 88
self-styled 1 442 88
“weapons 1 442 88
expert”. 1 442 88

Like 1 442 89
Luke 1 442 89
Harding, 1 442 89
Higgins 1 442 89
invariably 1 442 89
seems 1 442 89
ready 1 442 89
to 1 442 89
echo 1 442 89
whatever 1 442 89
the 1 442 89
British 1 442 89
and 1 442 89
American 1 442 89
security 1 442 89
services 1 442 89
need 1 442 89
verifying 1 442 89
“independently”. 1 442 89

Higgins 1 442 90
and 1 442 90
his 1 442 90
well-staffed 1 442 90
website 1 442 90
Bellingcat 1 442 90
have 1 442 90
taken 1 442 90
on 1 442 90
for 1 442 90
themselves 1 442 90
the 1 442 90
role 1 442 90
of 1 442 90
arbiters 1 442 90
of 1 442 90
truth 1 442 90
on 1 442 90
many 1 442 90
foreign 1 442 90
affairs 1 442 90
issues, 1 442 90
taking 1 442 90
a 1 442 90
prominent 1 442 90
role 1 442 90
in 1 442 90
advocating 1 442 90
for 1 442 90
narratives 1 442 90
that 1 442 90
promote 1 442 90
US 1 442 90
and 1 442 90
NATO 1 442 90
hegemony 1 442 90
while 1 442 90
demonising 1 442 90
Russia, 1 442 90
especially 1 442 90
in 1 442 90
highly 1 442 90
contested 1 442 90
arenas 1 442 90
such 1 442 90
as 1 442 90
Syria. 1 442 90

That 0 442 91
clear 0 442 91
partisanship 0 442 91
should 0 442 91
be 0 442 91
no 0 442 91
surprise, 0 442 91
given 0 442 91
that 0 442 91
Higgins 0 442 91
now 0 442 91
enjoys 0 442 91
an 0 442 91
“academic” 0 442 91
position 0 442 91
at, 0 442 91
and 0 442 91
funding 0 442 91
from, 0 442 91
the 0 442 91
Atlantic 0 442 91
Council, 0 442 91
a 1 442 91
high-level, 1 442 91
Washington-based 1 442 91
think-tank 1 442 91
founded 1 442 91
to 1 442 91
drum 1 442 91
up 1 442 91
support 1 442 91
for 1 442 91
NATO 1 442 91
and 1 442 91
justify 1 442 91
its 1 442 91
imperialist 1 442 91
agenda. 1 442 91

Improbably, 1 442 92
the 1 442 92
Guardian 1 442 92
has 1 442 92
adopted 1 442 92
Higgins 1 442 92
as 1 442 92
the 1 442 92
poster-boy 1 442 92
for 1 442 92
a 1 442 92
supposed 1 442 92
citizen 1 442 92
journalism 1 442 92
it 1 442 92
has 1 442 92
sought 1 442 92
to 1 442 92
undermine 1 442 92
as 1 442 92
“fake 1 442 92
news” 1 442 92
whenever 1 442 92
it 1 442 92
occurs 1 442 92
on 1 442 92
social 1 442 92
media 1 442 92
without 1 442 92
the 1 442 92
endorsement 1 442 92
of 1 442 92
state-backed 1 442 92
organisations. 1 442 92

The 1 442 93
truth 1 442 93
is 1 442 93
that 1 442 93
the 1 442 93
Guardian 1 442 93
has 1 442 93
not 1 442 93
erred 1 442 93
in 1 442 93
this 1 442 93
latest 1 442 93
story 1 442 93
attacking 1 442 93
Assange, 1 442 93
or 1 442 93
in 1 442 93
its 1 442 93
much 1 442 93
longer-running 1 442 93
campaign 1 442 93
to 1 442 93
vilify 1 442 93
him. 1 442 93

With 1 442 94
this 1 442 94
story, 1 442 94
it 1 442 94
has 1 442 94
done 1 442 94
what 1 442 94
it 1 442 94
regularly 1 442 94
does 1 442 94
when 1 442 94
supposedly 1 442 94
vital 1 442 94
western 1 442 94
foreign 1 442 94
policy 1 442 94
interests 1 442 94
are 1 442 94
at 1 442 94
stake 1 442 94
– 1 442 94
it 1 442 94
simply 1 442 94
regurgitates 1 442 94
an 1 442 94
elite-serving, 1 442 94
western 1 442 94
narrative. 1 442 94

Its 1 442 95
job 1 442 95
is 1 442 95
to 1 442 95
shore 1 442 95
up 1 442 95
a 1 442 95
consensus 1 442 95
on 1 442 95
the 1 442 95
left 1 442 95

leading 1 442 95
threats 1 442 95
to 1 442 95
the 1 442 95
existing, 1 442 95
neoliberal 1 442 95
order: 1 442 95
whether 0 442 95
they 0 442 95
are 0 442 95
a 0 442 95
platform 0 442 95
like 0 442 95
Wikileaks 0 442 95
promoting 0 442 95
whistle-blowing 1 442 95
against 0 442 95
a 1 442 95
corrupt 1 442 95
western 1 442 95
elite; 1 442 95
or 0 442 95
a 0 442 95
politician 0 442 95
like 0 442 95

chip 0 442 95
away 0 442 95

of 1 442 95

including 0 442 95
the 0 442 95
Guardian. 0 442 95

The 1 442 96
Guardian 1 442 96
did 1 442 96
not 1 442 96
make 1 442 96
a 1 442 96
mistake 1 442 96
in 1 442 96
vilifying 1 442 96

says 0 128 7
he 0 128 7
had 0 128 7
no 0 128 7

met 0 128 7
him 0 128 7
just 0 128 7
a 0 128 7
few 0 128 7
weeks 0 128 7
before 0 128 7
the 0 128 7

Haig 0 128 8
says 0 128 8
he 0 128 8
sold 0 128 8
Paddock 0 128 8
720 0 128 8
rounds 0 128 8
of 0 128 8
ammunition 0 128 8
from 0 128 8
Haig's 0 128 8

"I 0 128 9
couldn't 0 128 9
detect 0 128 9
anything 0 128 9
wrong 0 128 9
with 0 128 9
this 0 128 9
guy," 0 128 9
he 0 128 9
said. 0 128 9

"He 0 128 10
told 0 128 10
me 0 128 10
exactly 0 128 10
what 0 128 10
he 0 128 10
wanted. 0 128 10

I 0 128 11
handed 0 128 11
him 0 128 11
a 0 128 11
box 0 128 11
with 0 128 11
the 0 128 11
ammunition 0 128 11
in 0 128 11
it, 0 128 11

he 0 128 11
paid 0 128 11
me 0 128 11
and 0 128 11
he 0 128 11
left." 0 128 11

The 0 128 12
rounds 0 128 12
he 0 128 12
sold 0 128 12
are 0 128 12
called 0 128 12
"tracer 0 128 12
ammunition" 0 128 12

bullets 0 128 12
that 0 128 12
leave 0 128 12
a 0 128 12

when 0 128 12

"He 0 128 13

he 0 128 13
was 0 128 13
going 0 128 13

And 0 128 14
I 0 128 14
can't 0 128 14
remember 0 128 14
whether 0 128 14
he 0 128 14
said 0 128 14
for 0 128 14
or 0 128 14
with 0 128 14
his 0 128 14
friends, 0 128 14
but 0 128 14
that's 0 128 14
what 0 128 14
he 0 128 14
did 0 128 14
say," 0 128 14

"may 0 128 15
have 0 128 15
conspired 0 128 15

Haig 0 128 16
strongly 0 128 16
denies 0 128 16
that. 0 128 16

"I 0 128 17
felt 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
they 0 128 17
were 0 128 17
hoping 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
they 0 128 17
could 0 128 17
find 0 128 17
a 0 128 17
connection 0 128 17
between 0 128 17
myself 0 128 17
and 0 128 17
Paddock, 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
would 0 128 17
go 0 128 17
back 0 128 17
showing 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
I 0 128 17
supplied 0 128 17
him 0 128 17
with 0 128 17
most 0 128 17
of 0 128 17
his 0 128 17
ammunition, 0 128 17
possibly 0 128 17
even 0 128 17
some 0 128 17
firearms," 0 128 17
Haig 0 128 17
said. 0 128 17

"They're 0 128 18
not 0 128 18
gonna 0 128 18
find 0 128 18
it. 0 128 18

I 0 128 19

three 0 128 19

It's 0 128 20
unclear 0 128 20
whether 0 128 20

does 0 128 23
not 0 128 23

within 0 128 23

of 0 128 23

scheduled 0 130 3
to 0 130 3
launch 0 130 3

is 0 130 4
a 0 130 4
patch 0 130 4
of 0 130 4

about 0 130 4
370 0 130 4

away 0 130 4
from 0 130 4
the 0 130 4

where 0 130 4

the 0 130 4

may 0 130 4
be 0 130 4
4 0 130 4
billion 0 130 4
years 0 130 4
old, 0 130 4
formed 0 130 4
just 0 130 4
after 0 130 4
the 0 130 4

to 0 130 4

The 0 130 5
region 0 130 5
is 0 130 5
an 0 130 5
area 0 130 5
NASA 0 130 5
would 0 130 5
also 0 130 5
like 0 130 5
to 0 130 5
visit, 0 130 5
preferably 0 130 5
with 0 130 5
a 0 130 5
robot 0 130 5
that 0 130 5
would 0 130 5
bring 0 130 5
souvenir 0 130 5
rock 0 130 5
home 0 130 5
to 0 130 5
Earth 0 130 5
for 0 130 5
scientists 0 130 5
to 0 130 5
analyze 0 130 5
directly 0 130 5
in 0 130 5
the 0 130 5
laboratory. 0 130 5

But 0 130 6
despite 0 130 6
NASA's 0 130 6

on 0 130 6

as 0 130 6

by 0 130 6
an 0 130 6

noted 0 135 25
that 0 135 25
Haig's 0 135 25

after 0 135 33
the 0 135 33

he 0 135 33
has 0 135 33
stopped 0 135 33
his 0 135 33
side 0 135 33
business. 0 135 33

It 0 135 34
wasn't 0 135 34
unusual 0 135 34
for 0 135 34
a 0 135 34
customer 0 135 34

asked 0 135 37
about 0 135 37

Haig 0 135 39
said 0 135 39
he's 0 135 39
sorry 0 135 39
that 0 135 39
the 0 135 39
massacre 0 135 39
took 0 135 39
place, 0 135 39
but 0 135 39
emphasized 0 135 39
that 0 135 39
he 0 135 39
had 0 135 39
nothing 0 135 39
to 0 135 39
do 0 135 39
with 0 135 39
Paddock's 0 135 39
mass 0 135 39
shooting. 0 135 39

“I 0 135 40
had 0 135 40
no 0 135 40
contribution 0 135 40
to 0 135 40
what 0 135 40
Paddock 0 135 40
did,” 0 135 40
Haig 0 135 40
said 0 135 40
at 0 135 40
the 0 135 40
news 0 135 40
conference. 0 135 40

“I 0 135 41
had 1 135 41
no 1 135 41
way 1 135 41
to 1 135 41
see 1 135 41
into 1 135 41

mind. 1 135 41

The 0 135 42
product 0 135 42
that 0 135 42
I 0 135 42
sold 0 135 42

absolutely 1 135 42
nothing 1 135 42
to 1 135 42
do 1 135 42
with 0 135 42
what 0 135 42
he 0 135 42
did.” 0 135 42

Nevertheless, 0 135 43
it's 0 135 43
hard 0 135 43
to 0 135 43
believe 0 135 43
that 0 135 43
Haig's 0 135 43
denials 0 135 43
will 0 135 43
dissuade 0 135 43
the 0 135 43

He 0 139 22

He 0 139 23

They 1 142 12
don't 1 142 12

said 0 167 6
in 0 167 6
his 0 167 6
address 0 167 6
that 0 167 6
he 0 167 6
regrets 0 167 6
the 0 167 6
separation 0 167 6
of 0 167 6
the 0 167 6
Church's 0 167 6
doctrinal 0 167 6
and 0 167 6
moral 0 167 6
teaching 0 167 6
and 0 167 6
called 0 167 6
Christianity 0 167 6
a 0 167 6
“theocentric 1 167 6

of 1 167 6
the 1 167 6
this-worldly 1 167 6

conditions” 1 167 6
is 1 167 6
a 1 167 6
“suicidal 1 167 6
modernization” 1 167 6
that 1 167 6
denies 1 167 6

this 0 167 7
context, 0 167 7
the 0 167 7
German 0 167 7
cardinal 0 167 7
also 0 167 7
criticized 0 167 7
Martin 0 167 7
Luther's 0 167 7
own 0 167 7
denial 0 167 7
of 0 167 7
man's 0 167 7
free 0 167 7
will 0 167 7
and 0 167 7
his 0 167 7
teaching 0 167 7
about 0 167 7
the 0 167 7
total 0 167 7
depravity 0 167 7
of 0 167 7
man 0 167 7
that 0 167 7
separates 0 167 7
morality 0 167 7
from 0 167 7
the 0 167 7
relationship 0 167 7
with 0 167 7
God. 0 167 7

Morality, 0 167 8
Müller 0 167 8
explained, 0 167 8
is 0 167 8
rooted 0 167 8
in 0 167 8
Grace; 0 167 8
that 0 167 8
is 0 167 8
why 0 167 8
any 0 167 8
teaching 0 167 8
about 0 167 8
“rules 0 167 8
and 0 167 8
exceptions” 0 167 8
ignores 0 167 8
the 0 167 8
character 0 167 8
of 0 167 8
the 0 167 8
ethics 0 167 8
of 0 167 8

In 0 167 9
the 0 167 9

talk, 0 167 9
Cardinal 0 167 9
Müller 0 167 9
also 0 167 9
responded 0 167 9
to 0 167 9
questions 0 167 9

Amoris 0 167 9

The 0 167 10
cardinal 0 167 10
said 0 167 10
that 0 167 10
he 0 167 10
is 0 167 10
“not 0 167 10
happy” 0 167 10
about 0 167 10
the 0 167 10
fact 0 167 10
that 0 167 10
there 0 167 10
are 0 167 10
different 0 167 10
interpretations 0 167 10
of 0 167 10
this 0 167 10
papal 0 167 10
text 0 167 10
by 0 167 10
some 0 167 10
bishops' 0 167 10
conferences. 0 167 10

“In 1 167 11
dogmatic 1 167 11
questions, 1 167 11
there 1 167 11
cannot 1 167 11
be 1 167 11
a 1 167 11
plurality,” 1 167 11
he 0 167 11
added. 0 167 11

There 1 167 12
is 1 167 12
only 1 167 12
one 1 167 12
Magisterium, 1 167 12
he 1 167 12
said, 1 167 12
and 1 167 12
bishops' 1 167 12
conferences 1 167 12
can 1 167 12
only 1 167 12
decide 1 167 12
about 1 167 12
pastoral 1 167 12
questions. 1 167 12

Contradictory 0 167 13
conceptions 0 167 13
concerning 0 167 13
the 0 167 13
Sacraments, 0 167 13
said 0 167 13
the 0 167 13
cardinal, 0 167 13
lead 0 167 13
into 0 167 13
chaotic 0 167 13
conditions. 0 167 13

Thus, 0 167 14
explained 0 167 14
the 0 167 14
cardinal, 0 167 14
the 1 167 14
Sacraments 1 167 14
have 1 167 14
to 1 167 14
be 1 167 14
celebrated 1 167 14
the 1 167 14
way 1 167 14
Christ 1 167 14
Himself 1 167 14
willed 1 167 14
it 1 167 14
when 1 167 14
he 1 167 14
instituted 1 167 14
them. 1 167 14

The 0 167 15
controversial 0 167 15
eighth 0 167 15
chapter 0 167 15
of 0 167 15
Amoris 0 167 15
Laetitia 0 167 15
has 0 167 15
to 0 167 15
be 0 167 15
understood 0 167 15
“in 0 167 15
an 0 167 15
orthodox 0 167 15
way,” 0 167 15
namely 0 167 15
that 0 167 15
“he 1 167 15
who 1 167 15
lives 1 167 15
in 1 167 15
the 1 167 15
state 1 167 15
of 1 167 15
mortal 1 167 15
sin 1 167 15
cannot 1 167 15
receive 1 167 15
Holy 1 167 15
Communion.” 1 167 15
It 0 167 15
is, 0 167 15
in 0 167 15
Müller's 0 167 15
eyes, 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
pope's 0 167 15
duty 0 167 15
“to 0 167 15
unite 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
Church, 0 167 15
that 0 167 15
is 0 167 15
what 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
pope 0 167 15
is 0 167 15
there 0 167 15
for.” 0 167 15
This 0 167 15
is 0 167 15
what 0 167 15
he, 0 167 15
Müller, 0 167 15
himself 0 167 15

The 0 171 5

observations 0 187 66
are 0 187 66
in 0 187 66
order 0 187 66
here: 0 187 66

First, 1 187 67
the 1 187 67
open 1 187 67
carry 1 187 67
of 1 187 67
a 1 187 67

LEGAL 1 187 67

the 1 187 67
area 1 187 67
where 1 187 67
this 1 187 67
took 1 187 67
place. 1 187 67

So, 1 187 68
the 1 187 68
fellow 1 187 68
was 1 187 68
violating 1 187 68
NO 1 187 68
gun 1 187 68

whatsoever. 1 187 68

Plus, 0 187 69
he 0 187 69
never 0 187 69
removed 0 187 69
the 0 187 69
pistol 0 187 69
from 0 187 69
its 0 187 69
holster 0 187 69
or 0 187 69
brandished 0 187 69
it 0 187 69
in 0 187 69
any 0 187 69
way. 0 187 69

Secondly, 0 187 70
the 0 187 70
man 0 187 70
was 0 187 70
“known” 0 187 70
to 0 187 70
nearby 0 187 70
bars 0 187 70

That 0 187 71
means 0 187 71
nothing. 0 187 71

for 0 187 72
what? 0 187 72

The 0 187 73
report 0 187 73
doesn’t 0 187 73
even 0 187 73
say 0 187 73
the 0 187 73
man 0 187 73
was 0 187 73
known 0 187 73
for 0 187 73
acting 0 187 73
weirdly 0 187 73
or 0 187 73
strangely. 0 187 73

It 0 187 74
just 0 187 74

did 0 187 74
act 0 187 74
weirdly 0 187 74
or 0 187 74
strangely, 0 187 74
if 0 187 74
we 0 187 74
denied 0 187 74
constitutional 0 187 74
rights 0 187 74
to 0 187 74
everyone 0 187 74
in 0 187 74
that 0 187 74
category, 0 187 74
a 0 187 74
majority 0 187 74
of 0 187 74
Americans 0 187 74
would 0 187 74
have 0 187 74
no 0 187 74
rights, 0 187 74
and 1 187 74
ALL 1 187 74
of 1 187 74
Congress 1 187 74
would 1 187 74
have 1 187 74
no 1 187 74
rights. 1 187 74

Thirdly, 1 187 75
what 1 187 75
does 1 187 75
“volume 1 187 75
of 1 187 75
complaints” 1 187 75
mean? 1 187 75

How 1 187 76
many 1 187 76
complaints 1 187 76
were 1 187 76
received 1 187 76
over 1 187 76
a 1 187 76
YEAR’S 1 187 76
time? 1 187 76

Two? 1 187 77

Five? 1 187 78

Ten? 1 187 79

People 1 187 80
complaining 1 187 80
about 1 187 80
other 1 187 80
people 1 187 80
happens 1 187 80
all 1 187 80
of 1 187 80
the 1 187 80
time. 1 187 80

Plus, 0 187 81
if 0 187 81
complaints 0 187 81
had 0 187 81
been 0 187 81
received 0 187 81
over 0 187 81
the 0 187 81
course 0 187 81
of 0 187 81
an 0 187 81
entire 0 187 81
year 0 187 81
and 0 187 81
police 0 187 81
just 0 187 81
now 0 187 81
decided 0 187 81
to 0 187 81
act, 0 187 81
the 0 187 81
man 0 187 81
must 0 187 81
not 0 187 81
have 0 187 81
been 0 187 81
considered 0 187 81
much 0 187 81
of 0 187 81
a 0 187 81
threat. 0 187 81

Fourthly, 0 187 82
there 0 187 82
was 0 187 82
NO 1 187 82
report 0 187 82
of 0 187 82
the 0 187 82
man 0 187 82
“exhibiting 0 187 82
violent 0 187 82
behavior,” 0 187 82
as 0 187 82
the 0 187 82
police 0 187 82
sergeant 0 187 82
claims. 0 187 82

The 0 187 83
report 0 187 83
says 0 187 83
“he 0 187 83
had 0 187 83
been 0 187 83
intimidating 0 187 83
people.” 0 187 83
How? 0 187 83

No 0 187 84
specifics 0 187 84
except 0 187 84
to 0 187 84
say 0 187 84
he 0 187 84
was 0 187 84
“staring” 0 187 84
at 0 187 84
people. 0 187 84

Wow! 1 187 85

Run 1 187 86
for 1 187 86
your 1 187 86
lives! 1 187 86

Fifthly, 1 187 87
a 1 187 87
U.S. 1 187 87
citizen 1 187 87
who 1 187 87
has 1 187 87
committed 1 187 87
NO 1 187 87
CRIME 1 187 87
is 1 187 87
denied 1 187 87
his 1 187 87
Natural 1 187 87
right 1 187 87
of 1 187 87
self-defense 1 187 87
for 1 187 87
a 1 187 87
whole 1 187 87
year. 1 187 87

And 1 187 88
the 1 187 88
media 1 187 88
report 1 187 88
says 1 187 88
the 1 187 88
confiscations 1 187 88
“only” 1 187 88
last 1 187 88
a 1 187 88
year, 1 187 88
with 1 187 88
the 1 187 88
caveat 1 187 88
that 1 187 88
they 1 187 88
may 1 187 88
be 1 187 88
extended. 1 187 88

Indeed. 1 187 89

They 1 187 90
could 1 187 90
and 1 187 90
very 1 187 90
likely 1 187 90
will 1 187 90
be 1 187 90
extended 1 187 90
indefinitely. 1 187 90

How 1 187 91
many 1 187 91
defenseless 1 187 91
(unarmed) 1 187 91
people 1 187 91
are 1 187 91
robbed, 1 187 91
assaulted, 1 187 91
accosted, 1 187 91
beaten 1 187 91
up, 1 187 91
raped, 1 187 91
wounded, 1 187 91
paralyzed, 1 187 91
or 1 187 91
killed 1 187 91
in 1 187 91
a 1 187 91
year’s 1 187 91
time? 1 187 91

It 0 187 92
seems 0 187 92
many 0 187 92
politicians 0 187 92
(and 0 187 92
many 0 187 92
police 0 187 92
officers 0 187 92
themselves) 0 187 92
will 0 187 92
not 0 187 92
be 0 187 92
content 0 187 92
until 0 187 92
every 0 187 92
American 0 187 92
citizen 0 187 92
is 0 187 92
totally 0 187 92
defenseless 0 187 92
and 0 187 92
unable 0 187 92
to 0 187 92
protect 0 187 92
him 0 187 92
or 0 187 92
herself. 0 187 92

I 0 187 93
tell 0 187 93
you 0 187 93
this 0 187 93
with 0 187 93
all 0 187 93
seriousness: 0 187 93
At 1 187 93
some 1 187 93
point, 1 187 93
the 1 187 93
American 1 187 93
people 1 187 93
will 1 187 93
be 1 187 93
forced 1 187 93
to 1 187 93
view 1 187 93
these 1 187 93
governmental 1 187 93
attacks 1 187 93
against 1 187 93
our 1 187 93
Second 1 187 93
Amendment 1 187 93
liberties 1 187 93
as 1 187 93
a 1 187 93
declaration 1 187 93
of 1 187 93
war. 1 187 93

Sixthly, 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
man 0 187 94
quoted 0 187 94
in 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
news 0 187 94
story 0 187 94
who 0 187 94
had 0 187 94
complained 0 187 94
about 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
armed 0 187 94
fellow 0 187 94
did 0 187 94
so 0 187 94
because 0 187 94
he 0 187 94
said 0 187 94
he 0 187 94
didn’t 0 187 94
like 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
sight 0 187 94
of 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
man 0 187 94
carrying 0 187 94
a 0 187 94
firearm, 0 187 94
as 0 187 94
it 0 187 94
made 0 187 94
him 0 187 94
“afraid.” 0 187 94

SO 1 187 95
WHAT? 1 187 95

That 0 187 96
the 0 187 96
mere 0 187 96
sight 0 187 96
of 0 187 96
a 0 187 96
law-abiding 0 187 96
citizen 0 187 96
openly 0 187 96
carrying 0 187 96
a 0 187 96
sidearm 0 187 96
would 0 187 96
make 0 187 96
someone 0 187 96
“afraid” 0 187 96
is 0 187 96
not 0 187 96
sufficient 0 187 96
reason 0 187 96
to 0 187 96
deny 0 187 96
the 0 187 96
citizen 0 187 96
his 0 187 96
constitutional 0 187 96
right 0 187 96
to 0 187 96
keep 0 187 96
and 0 187 96
“bear” 0 187 96
arms. 0 187 96

This 1 187 97
“I’m 1 187 97
offended” 1 187 97
or 1 187 97
“his 1 187 97
gun 1 187 97
scares 1 187 97
me” 1 187 97
complaint 1 187 97
is 1 187 97
nothing 1 187 97
but 1 187 97
cover 1 187 97
for 1 187 97
little 1 187 97
Nazis 1 187 97
to 1 187 97
try 1 187 97
and 1 187 97
deny 1 187 97
another 1 187 97
person 1 187 97
their 1 187 97
Natural, 1 187 97
God-given 1 187 97
liberty. 1 187 97

But 0 187 98
under 0 187 98
this 0 187 98
new 0 187 98
“red 0 187 98
flag” 0 187 98
law 0 187 98
in 0 187 98
Washington 0 187 98
State, 0 187 98
police 0 187 98
are 0 187 98
now 0 187 98
able 0 187 98
to 0 187 98
confiscate 0 187 98
a 0 187 98
person’s 0 187 98
firearm 0 187 98
without 0 187 98
the 0 187 98
person 0 187 98
committing 0 187 98
ANY 1 187 98
crime—or 0 187 98
even 0 187 98
threatening 0 187 98
to 0 187 98
commit 0 187 98
a 0 187 98
crime. 0 187 98

Even 0 187 99
when 0 187 99
police 0 187 99
forced 0 187 99
the 0 187 99
man 0 187 99
to 0 187 99
surrender 0 187 99
his 0 187 99
firearm, 0 187 99
the 0 187 99
man 0 187 99
made 0 187 99
no 0 187 99
threatening 0 187 99
gesture 0 187 99
toward 0 187 99
the 0 187 99
officers. 0 187 99

Gun 0 187 100
confiscation 0 187 100
has 0 187 100
started 0 187 100
in 0 187 100
America—and 0 187 100
President 1 187 100
Trump’s 1 187 100
Stalinist 1 187 100
statements 1 187 100
about 1 187 100
taking 1 187 100
guns 1 187 100
first 1 187 100
and 1 187 100
worrying 1 187 100
about 1 187 100
due 1 187 100
process 1 187 100
later 1 187 100
is 1 187 100
the 1 187 100
banner 1 187 100
under 1 187 100
which 1 187 100
this 1 187 100
is 1 187 100
happening. 1 187 100

When 0 187 101
Trump 0 187 101
promised 0 187 101
to 0 187 101
add 0 187 101
“mental 0 187 101
health” 0 187 101
regulations 0 187 101
to 0 187 101
gun 0 187 101
purchases 0 187 101
and 0 187 101
ownership, 0 187 101
he 1 187 101
opened 1 187 101
Pandora’s 1 187 101
Box. 1 187 101

I 0 187 102
go 0 187 102
into 0 187 102
the 0 187 102
“mental 0 187 102
health” 0 187 102
trap 0 187 102
in 0 187 102
more 0 187 102
detail 0 187 102
in 0 187 102
this 0 187 102
column: 0 187 102

Trump 0 187 103
Set 0 187 103
To 0 187 103
Enact 0 187 103
More 0 187 103
Gun 0 187 103
Control 0 187 103

“Mental 0 187 104
health” 0 187 104
regulations 0 187 104
for 0 187 104
gun 0 187 104
ownership 0 187 104
is 0 187 104
what 0 187 104
extremist 0 187 104
gun 0 187 104
grabbers 0 187 104
Schumer, 0 187 104
Pelosi, 0 187 104
Feinstein, 0 187 104
et 0 187 104
al., 0 187 104
have 0 187 104
been 0 187 104
trying 0 187 104
to 0 187 104
accomplish 0 187 104
for 0 187 104
decades. 0 187 104

Now, 0 187 105
it 0 187 105
is 0 187 105
the 0 187 105
“pro-gun” 0 187 105
Republican 0 187 105
President 0 187 105
Donald 0 187 105
Trump 0 187 105
who 0 187 105
is 0 187 105
the 0 187 105
one 0 187 105
making 0 187 105
it 0 187 105
happen. 0 187 105

Kris 0 187 106
Kobach 0 187 106
is 0 187 106
the 0 187 106
Secretary 0 187 106
of 0 187 106
State 0 187 106
of 0 187 106
Kansas. 0 187 106

He 0 187 107
is 0 187 107
a 0 187 107
former 0 187 107
professor 0 187 107
of 0 187 107
constitutional 0 187 107
law 0 187 107
at 0 187 107
UMKC 0 187 107
Law 0 187 107
School. 0 187 107

He 0 187 108
wrote 0 187 108
an 0 187 108
excellent 0 187 108
analysis 0 187 108
of 0 187 108
the 0 187 108
constitutional 0 187 108
violations 0 187 108
of 0 187 108
these 0 187 108
“red 0 187 108
flag” 0 187 108
laws: 0 187 108

The 0 187 109
seizure 0 187 109
of 0 187 109
guns 0 187 109
without 0 187 109
any 0 187 109
hearing 0 187 109
at 0 187 109
all. 0 187 109

The 0 187 110
laws 0 187 110
all 0 187 110
contain 0 187 110
an 0 187 110
“ex 0 187 110
parte” 0 187 110
provision 0 187 110
that 0 187 110
allows 0 187 110
the 0 187 110
state 0 187 110
to 0 187 110
temporarily 0 187 110
seize 0 187 110
a 0 187 110
person’s 0 187 110
guns 0 187 110
without 0 187 110
even 0 187 110
notifying 0 187 110
the 0 187 110
gun 0 187 110
owner 0 187 110
or 0 187 110
giving 0 187 110
him 0 187 110
a 0 187 110
chance 0 187 110
to 0 187 110
be 0 187 110
heard. 0 187 110

This 0 187 111
is 0 187 111
the 0 187 111
quintessential 0 187 111
denial 0 187 111
of 0 187 111
due 0 187 111
process. 0 187 111

The 0 187 112
Fourth 0 187 112
Amendment 0 187 112
makes 0 187 112
clear 0 187 112
that 0 187 112
a 0 187 112
person 0 187 112
cannot 0 187 112
be 0 187 112
denied 0 187 112
of 0 187 112
liberty 0 187 112
(to 0 187 112
exercise 0 187 112
one’s 0 187 112
constitutional 0 187 112
right 0 187 112
to 0 187 112
bear 0 187 112
arms) 0 187 112
without 0 187 112
due 0 187 112
process 0 187 112
of 0 187 112
law. 0 187 112

This 0 187 113
confiscation 0 187 113
is 0 187 113
“temporary,” 0 187 113
but 0 187 113
it 0 187 113
can 0 187 113
easily 0 187 113
lead 0 187 113
to 0 187 113
long-term 0 187 113
or 0 187 113
permanent 0 187 113
confiscation. 0 187 113

Based 0 187 114
on 0 187 114
the 0 187 114
testimony 0 187 114
of 0 187 114
one 0 187 114
unrelated 0 187 114
person. 0 187 114

The 0 187 115
confiscation 0 187 115
order 0 187 115
can 0 187 115

on 0 187 115
the 0 187 115
testimony 0 187 115
of 0 187 115
only 0 187 115
one 0 187 115
person 0 187 115
claiming 0 187 115
that 0 187 115
the 0 187 115

others. 0 187 115

The 0 187 116
law 0 187 116
deceptively 1 187 116
says 1 187 116
that 0 187 116
it 0 187 116
has 0 187 116
to 0 187 116
be 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
testimony 0 187 116
of 0 187 116
a 0 187 116
“family 0 187 116
member.” 0 187 116
[Most 0 187 116
of 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
“red 0 187 116

laws, 0 187 116
such 0 187 116
as 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
one 0 187 116
in 0 187 116
Washington 0 187 116
State, 0 187 116
do 0 187 116
not 0 187 116
limit 0 187 116
who 0 187 116
can 0 187 116
claim 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
gun 0 187 116

others 0 187 116
to 0 187 116
family 0 187 116
members.] 0 187 116

But 0 187 117
“family 0 187 117
member” 0 187 117
is 0 187 117
defined 0 187 117
to 0 187 117
include 0 187 117
“former 0 187 117
dating 0 187 117

anyone 0 187 117
who 0 187 117

ever 0 187 117
lived 0 187 117
with 0 187 117
the 0 187 117
defendant. 0 187 117

So 0 187 118
a 0 187 118
jilted 0 187 118
former 0 187 118
boyfriend 0 187 118

a 0 187 118
roommate 0 187 118
from 0 187 118
years 0 187 118
ago, 0 187 118
could 0 187 118
easily 0 187 118
set 0 187 118
in 0 187 118
motion 0 187 118
the 0 187 118
disarming 0 187 118

a 0 187 118
lawful 0 187 118
gun 0 187 118
owner. 0 187 118

Using 0 187 119
a 0 187 119
very 0 187 119
low 0 187 119
standard 0 187 119
of 0 187 119
proof. 0 187 119

The 0 187 120
standard 0 187 120
for 0 187 120
obtaining 0 187 120
an 0 187 120
ex 0 187 120

against 0 187 120
a 0 187 120
gun 0 187 120
owner 0 187 120
is 0 187 120
absurdly 1 187 120
low 1 187 120
– 0 187 120
one 0 187 120
need 0 187 120
only 0 187 120
show 0 187 120
“reasonable 0 187 120

to 0 187 120
believe 0 187 120
that 0 187 120
the 0 187 120
person 0 187 120
may 0 187 120
pose 0 187 120
a 0 187 120
risk. 0 187 120

That’s 0 187 121
even 0 187 121
lower 0 187 121
than 0 187 121
the 0 187 121
“probable 0 187 121

standard 0 187 121
for 0 187 121
obtaining 0 187 121
a 0 187 121
search 0 187 121
warrant. 0 187 121

In 0 187 122
addition, 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
judge 0 187 122
is 0 187 122
forced 0 187 122
to 0 187 122
rush 0 187 122
his 0 187 122
decision 0 187 122
and 0 187 122
issue 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
confiscation 0 187 122
order 0 187 122
on 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
same 0 187 122
day 0 187 122
of 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
ex 0 187 122
parte 0 187 122
hearing. 0 187 122

Within 0 187 123
two 0 187 123
weeks 0 187 123
of 0 187 123
the 0 187 123
ex 0 187 123
parte 0 187 123
hearing, 0 187 123
a 0 187 123
hearing 0 187 123
with 0 187 123
the 0 187 123
gun 0 187 123
owner 0 187 123
present 0 187 123
must 0 187 123
occur; 0 187 123
the 0 187 123
purpose 0 187 123
is 0 187 123
to 0 187 123
put 0 187 123
in 0 187 123
place 0 187 123
a 0 187 123
long-term 0 187 123
confiscation 0 187 123
order. 0 187 123

But 0 187 124
even 0 187 124
at 0 187 124
that 0 187 124
hearing, 0 187 124
the 0 187 124
standard 0 187 124
of 0 187 124
proof 0 187 124
is 0 187 124
far 0 187 124
below 0 187 124
the 0 187 124
“beyond 0 187 124
a 0 187 124
reasonable 0 187 124
doubt” 0 187 124
standard 0 187 124
used 0 187 124
in 0 187 124
criminal 0 187 124
trials. 0 187 124

Rather, 0 187 125
it 0 187 125
need 0 187 125
only 0 187 125
be 0 187 125
shown 0 187 125
by 0 187 125
“a 0 187 125
preponderance 0 187 125
of 0 187 125
evidence” 0 187 125
that 0 187 125
the 0 187 125
person 0 187 125
poses 0 187 125
a 0 187 125
risk 0 187 125
of 0 187 125
injury 0 187 125
to 0 187 125
self 0 187 125
or 0 187 125
others. 0 187 125

What 0 187 126
kind 0 187 126
of 0 187 126
evidence? 0 187 126

Things 0 187 127
like 0 187 127
the 0 187 127
“reckless 0 187 127
storage” 0 187 127
of 0 187 127
firearms 0 187 127
and 0 187 127
drinking 0 187 127
habits 0 187 127
can 0 187 127
be 0 187 127
considered. 0 187 127

If 1 187 128
you 1 187 128
keep 1 187 128
a 1 187 128
handgun 1 187 128
in 1 187 128
the 1 187 128
bedside 1 187 128
table 1 187 128
and 1 187 128
drink 1 187 128
beer 1 187 128
regularly, 1 187 128
you 1 187 128
may 1 187 128
[be] 1 187 128
in 1 187 128
trouble. 1 187 128

Shifting 0 187 129
the 0 187 129
burden 0 187 129
of 0 187 129
proof 0 187 129
to 0 187 129
the 0 187 129
gun 0 187 129
owner. 0 187 129

The 0 187 130
long-term 0 187 130
confiscation 0 187 130
order 0 187 130
lasts 0 187 130
up 0 187 130
to 0 187 130
a 0 187 130
year, 0 187 130
but 0 187 130
may 0 187 130
be 0 187 130
renewed 0 187 130
indefinitely. 0 187 130

Once 0 187 131
it 0 187 131
is 0 187 131
in 0 187 131
place, 0 187 131
it 0 187 131
becomes 0 187 131
very 0 187 131
difficult 0 187 131
to 0 187 131
remove. 0 187 131

To 0 187 132
have 0 187 132
the 0 187 132
confiscation 0 187 132
order 0 187 132
lifted, 0 187 132
the 0 187 132
gun 0 187 132
owner 0 187 132
must 0 187 132
provehe 0 187 132
does 0 187 132
not 0 187 132
pose 0 187 132
a 0 187 132
threat 0 187 132
to 0 187 132
himself 0 187 132
or 0 187 132
others. 0 187 132

Proving 1 187 133
a 1 187 133
negative 1 187 133
is 1 187 133
nearly 1 187 133
impossible. 1 187 133

Adding 1 187 134
insult 1 187 134
to 1 187 134
injury, 1 187 134
the 0 187 134
bill 0 187 134
even 0 187 134
authorizes 0 187 134
local 0 187 134
law 0 187 134
enforcement 0 187 134
to 0 187 134
charge 0 187 134
the 0 187 134
gun 0 187 134
owner 0 187 134
a 0 187 134
storage 0 187 134
fee 0 187 134
for 0 187 134
confiscating 0 187 134
and 0 187 134
storing 0 187 134
his 0 187 134
guns. 0 187 134

After 0 187 135
the 0 187 135
Parkland 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
shooting, 0 187 135
had 0 187 135
Donald 0 187 135
Trump 0 187 135
simply 0 187 135
used 0 187 135
his 0 187 135
bully 1 187 135
pulpit 1 187 135
to 0 187 135
promote 0 187 135
arming 0 187 135
teachers 0 187 135
and 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
employees 0 187 135
as 0 187 135
a 0 187 135
deterrent 0 187 135
and 0 187 135
defense 0 187 135
against 0 187 135
these 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
shootings 0 187 135
without 0 187 135
calling 0 187 135
for 0 187 135
more 0 187 135
gun 0 187 135
control, 0 187 135
it 0 187 135
would 0 187 135
have 0 187 135
been 0 187 135
a 0 187 135
HUGE 1 187 135
boost 0 187 135
for 0 187 135
the 0 187 135
Second 0 187 135
Amendment 0 187 135
in 0 187 135
general 0 187 135
and 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
safety 0 187 135
in 0 187 135
particular. 0 187 135

Instead, 0 187 136
Trump 0 187 136
fell 0 187 136
in 0 187 136
with 0 187 136
anti-Second 0 187 136
Amendment 0 187 136
liberals 0 187 136
and 0 187 136
started 0 187 136
calling 0 187 136
for 0 187 136
more 0 187 136
gun 0 187 136
control, 0 187 136
adding 0 187 136
“mental 0 187 136

restrictions 0 187 136
to 0 187 136
gun 0 187 136
purchases 0 187 136
and 0 187 136
making 1 187 136
his 1 187 136
stupid 1 187 136
Stalinist 1 187 136
statements 1 187 136
about 1 187 136
taking 1 187 136
guns 1 187 136
first 1 187 136
and 1 187 136
worrying 1 187 136
about 1 187 136
due 1 187 136
process 1 187 136
later. 1 187 136

As 0 187 137
a 0 187 137
result, 0 187 137
anti-gun 0 187 137
liberals 0 187 137
all 0 187 137
over 0 187 137
the 0 187 137
country 0 187 137
are 0 187 137
using 0 187 137
Trump’s 0 187 137

words 0 187 137
and 0 187 137
proposed 0 187 137
gun 0 187 137

As 0 187 138
it 0 187 138
stands 0 187 138
right 0 187 138
now, 0 187 138
Donald 1 187 138
Trump 1 187 138
has 1 187 138
opened 1 187 138
the 1 187 138

for 1 187 138
more 1 187 138

our 1 187 138

Freedomists 0 187 139
in 0 187 139
the 0 187 139
50 0 187 139
states 0 187 139
had 0 187 139
better 0 187 139
keep 0 187 139
a 0 187 139
close 0 187 139

on 0 187 139

this 0 187 139
year 0 187 139
and 0 187 139
next, 0 187 139
because, 0 187 139
thanks 0 187 139
to 0 187 139
Donald 0 187 139
Trump, 0 187 139

confiscation 0 187 139
is 0 187 139
going 0 187 139
to 0 187 139

on 0 187 139
the 0 187 139

in 0 187 139
the 0 187 139

And 0 187 140
while 0 187 140
you 0 187 140
are 0 187 140
at 0 187 140
it, 0 187 140
don’t 0 187 140
overlook 0 187 140
the 0 187 140

No 0 187 141

Dianne 0 187 141
Feinstein 0 187 141
looked 0 187 141
so 1 187 141
deliriously 1 187 141
(and 1 187 141
devilishly) 1 187 141
happy 0 187 141
when 0 187 141
Trump 0 187 141
uttered 1 187 141
his 1 187 141

comment 1 187 141
about 0 187 141
gun 0 187 141

and 0 187 141
said 0 187 141
he 0 187 141

You 0 187 145

that 0 187 147
self-defense—including 0 187 147
defense 0 187 147
against 0 187 147
tyrannical 0 187 147
government—is 0 187 147
more 0 187 147
than 0 187 147
a 0 187 147
right 0 187 147

Second 0 187 147

their 0 187 148
means 0 187 148
of 0 187 148
self-defense 0 187 148
is 0 187 148
not 0 187 148
only 0 187 148
a 0 187 148
crime 0 187 148
against 0 187 148
liberty; 0 187 148
it 0 187 148
is 0 187 148
a 0 187 148
sin 0 187 148
against 0 187 148
God. 0 187 148

I 0 187 149

who 0 187 152
teach 0 187 152
that 0 187 152

to 0 187 152

the 0 187 152

They 1 187 154
are 1 187 154

biblically, 1 187 154
constitutionally, 0 187 154

system. 0 356 35

In 0 356 36
Cruz’s 0 356 36
eyes, 0 356 36
Guyger 0 356 36
going 0 356 36
into 0 356 36
an 0 356 36
apartment 0 356 36
that 0 356 36
wasn’t 0 356 36
her’s 0 356 36
and 0 356 36
killing 0 356 36
an 0 356 36
innocent 1 356 36
man 0 356 36
was 0 356 36
simply 0 356 36
a 0 356 36
case 0 356 36
of 0 356 36
being 0 356 36
in 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
wrong 0 356 36
place 0 356 36
at 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
wrong 0 356 36
time—a 0 356 36
tragic 0 356 36
mistake 0 356 36
that 0 356 36
ruined 0 356 36
two 0 356 36
lives, 0 356 36
according 0 356 36
to 0 356 36
Cruz. 0 356 36

But 0 356 37
that 0 356 37
is 0 356 37
not 0 356 37
the 0 356 37
case 0 356 37
at 0 356 37
all. 0 356 37

Would 0 356 38
Ted 0 356 38
Cruz 0 356 38
and 0 356 38
police 0 356 38
officers 0 356 38
be 0 356 38
following 0 356 38
this 0 356 38
same 0 356 38
narrative 0 356 38
if 0 356 38
the 0 356 38
roles 0 356 38
were 0 356 38
reversed? 0 356 38

If 0 356 39
it 0 356 39
was 0 356 39
Botham 0 356 39
Jean, 0 356 39
a 1 356 39
black 1 356 39
man, 1 356 39
walking 0 356 39
into 0 356 39
the 0 356 39
apartment 0 356 39
of 0 356 39
Amber 0 356 39
Guyger, 0 356 39
a 0 356 39
white 1 356 39
female 1 356 39
cop, 1 356 39
and 0 356 39
killing 0 356 39
her—would 0 356 39
police 0 356 39
and 0 356 39
Ted 0 356 39
Cruz 0 356 39
simply 0 356 39
write 0 356 39
it 0 356 39
off 0 356 39
as 0 356 39
a 0 356 39
tragic 0 356 39
accident? 0 356 39

Of 0 356 40
course, 0 356 40
we 0 356 40
know 0 356 40
the 0 356 40
answer 0 356 40
to 0 356 40
that 0 356 40
question 0 356 40
and 0 356 40
it 0 356 40
is 0 356 40
a 0 356 40
resounding, 0 356 40
NO. 0 356 40

To 0 356 41
shut 0 356 41
down 0 356 41
the 0 356 41
peanut 0 356 41
gallery 0 356 41
before 0 356 41
it 0 356 41
begins, 0 356 41
this 0 356 41
is 0 356 41
not 0 356 41
some 0 356 41
case 0 356 41
of 0 356 41
Democrat 0 356 41
versus 0 356 41
Republican 0 356 41
or 0 356 41
right 0 356 41
versus 0 356 41
left. 0 356 41

This 0 356 42
is 0 356 42
a 0 356 42
case 0 356 42
of 0 356 42
right 0 356 42
versus 0 356 42
wrong, 0 356 42
and 0 356 42
what 0 356 42
Amber 0 356 42
Guyger 0 356 42
did 0 356 42
to 0 356 42
Botham 0 356 42
Jean 0 356 42
was 0 356 42
wrong. 0 356 42

There 0 356 43
is 0 356 43
no 0 356 43
other 0 356 43
way 0 356 43
around 0 356 43
it, 0 356 43
“mistake” 0 356 43
or 0 356 43
not. 0 356 43

From 0 356 44
the 0 356 44
start 0 356 44
of 0 356 44
this 0 356 44
case, 0 356 44
law 0 356 44
enforcement 0 356 44
have 0 356 44
set 0 356 44
out 0 356 44
to 0 356 44
protect 0 356 44
Guyger 0 356 44
because 0 356 44
she 0 356 44
is 0 356 44
part 0 356 44
of 0 356 44
their 0 356 44
blue 0 356 44
line. 0 356 44

Amber 0 356 45
Guyger’s 0 356 45
home 0 356 45
was 0 356 45
never 0 356 45
searched 0 356 45
while 0 356 45
Jean’s 0 356 45
apartment 0 356 45
was 0 356 45
searched 0 356 45
that 0 356 45
night. 0 356 45

The 0 356 46
results 0 356 46
of 0 356 46
the 0 356 46
blood 0 356 46
test 0 356 46
to 0 356 46
test 0 356 46
for 0 356 46
alcohol 0 356 46
or 0 356 46
drugs 0 356 46
in 0 356 46
her 0 356 46
system 0 356 46
were 0 356 46
never 0 356 46
released, 0 356 46
yet 0 356 46
police 0 356 46
— 0 356 46
on 0 356 46
the 0 356 46
day 0 356 46
his 0 356 46
mother 0 356 46
buried 0 356 46
her 0 356 46
son 0 356 46
— 0 356 46
claimed 0 356 46
they 0 356 46
found 0 356 46
marijuana 0 356 46
in 0 356 46
his 0 356 46
house. 0 356 46

It’s 0 356 47
been 0 356 47
a 0 356 47
smear 0 356 47
campaign 0 356 47
from 0 356 47
the 0 356 47
beginning 0 356 47
and 0 356 47
it 0 356 47
is 0 356 47
this 0 356 47
way 0 356 47
by 0 356 47
design. 0 356 47

Amber 0 356 48
Guyger 0 356 48
took 0 356 48
an 0 356 48
innocent 1 356 48
person’s 0 356 48
life, 0 356 48
and 0 356 48
because 0 356 48
people 0 356 48
are 0 356 48
so 0 356 48
blinded 0 356 48
by 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
badge, 0 356 48
she 0 356 48
is 0 356 48
being 0 356 48
portrayed 0 356 48
as 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
victim. 0 356 48

To 0 356 49
those 0 356 49
who 0 356 49
attempt 0 356 49
to 0 356 49
claim 0 356 49
there 0 356 49
is 0 356 49
no 0 356 49
bias 0 356 49
in 0 356 49
this 0 356 49
horrifically 1 356 49
flawed 0 356 49
system, 0 356 49
if 0 356 49
ever 0 356 49
there 0 356 49
was 0 356 49
a 0 356 49
case 0 356 49
to 0 356 49
prove 0 356 49
you 0 356 49
wrong—this 0 356 49
is 0 356 49
it. 0 356 49

A 0 356 50
tragedy 0 356 50
indeed. 0 356 50
