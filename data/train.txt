Patel, 0 0 6
32, 0 0 6
was 0 0 6
the 0 0 6
first 0 0 6
Indian-American 0 0 6
writer 0 0 6
for 0 0 6

for 0 0 6

Emmy 0 0 6

for 0 0 6
Outstanding 0 0 6

Patel 0 0 7
has 0 0 7
previously 0 0 7
performed 0 0 7
on 0 0 7
Late 0 0 7

with 0 0 7

such 0 0 7
as 0 0 7
Chris 0 0 7
Rock. 0 0 7

During 0 0 8
the 0 0 8
event, 0 0 8
Patel’s 0 0 8
performance 0 0 8
featured 0 0 8
commentary 0 0 8
on 0 0 8
his 0 0 8
experience 0 0 8
living 0 0 8
in 0 0 8
a 0 0 8
diverse 0 0 8
area 0 0 8
of 0 0 8
New 0 0 8

City—including 0 0 8
a 0 0 8
joke 0 0 8
about 0 0 8
a 0 0 8
gay, 0 0 8
black 0 0 8
man 0 0 8
in 0 0 8
his 0 0 8
neighborhood—which 0 0 8
AAA 0 0 8
officials 0 0 8
deemed 0 0 8
inappropriate. 0 0 8

Patel 0 0 9
joked 0 0 9
that 0 0 9
being 0 0 9
gay 0 0 9
cannot 0 0 9
be 0 0 9
a 0 0 9
choice 0 0 9
because 0 0 9
“no 1 0 9
one 1 0 9
looks 1 0 9
in 1 0 9
the 1 0 9
mirror 1 0 9
and 1 0 9
thinks, 1 0 9
‘this 1 0 9
black 1 0 9
thing 1 0 9
is 1 0 9
too 1 0 9
easy, 1 0 9
let 1 0 9
me 1 0 9
just 1 0 9
add 1 0 9
another 1 0 9
thing 1 0 9
to 1 0 9
it.’” 0 0 9

That's 0 0 10
what 0 0 10
Columbia 1 0 10
snowflakes 1 0 10
thought 0 0 10
was 0 0 10
offensive. 0 0 10

I 0 0 11
can't 0 0 11
imagine 0 0 11
what 0 0 11
they 0 0 11
would 0 0 11
have 0 0 11
made 0 0 11
of 0 0 11
Richard 0 0 11
Pryor, 0 0 11
or 0 0 11
at 0 0 11
this 0 0 11
point 0 0 11
even, 0 0 11
Chris 0 0 11
Rock. 0 0 11

It's 0 0 12
also 0 0 12
a 0 0 12
version 0 0 12
of 0 0 12
a 0 0 12
Sammy 0 0 12
Davis 0 0 12
Jr 0 0 12
joke 0 0 12
about 0 0 12
converting 0 0 12
to 0 0 12
Judaism. 0 0 12

Which 0 0 13
is 0 0 13
now 0 0 13
a 0 0 13
hate 0 0 13
crime. 0 0 13

About 0 0 14
30 0 0 14
minutes 0 0 14
into 0 0 14
Patel’s 0 0 14
set, 0 0 14
members 0 0 14
of 0 0 14
AAA 0 0 14
interrupted 0 0 14
the 0 0 14
performance, 0 0 14
denounced 0 0 14
his 0 0 14
jokes 0 0 14
about 0 0 14
racial 0 0 14
identities 0 0 14
and 0 0 14
sexual 0 0 14
orientation, 0 0 14
and 0 0 14
provided 0 0 14
him 0 0 14
with 0 0 14
a 0 0 14
few 0 0 14
moments 0 0 14
for 0 0 14
closing 0 0 14
remarks. 0 0 14

Comrades, 1 0 15
these 1 0 15
jokes 1 0 15
you 1 0 15
have 1 0 15
been 1 0 15
listening 1 0 15
to 1 0 15
are 1 0 15
thought 1 0 15
crimes! 1 0 15

Patel 0 0 16
pushed 0 0 16
back 0 0 16
on 0 0 16
the 0 0 16
officials’ 0 0 16
remarks, 0 0 16
and 0 0 16
said 0 0 16
that 0 0 16
while 0 0 16
he 0 0 16
stood 0 0 16
in 0 0 16
solidarity 0 0 16
with 0 0 16
Asian 0 0 16
American 0 0 16
identities, 0 0 16
none 0 0 16
of 0 0 16
his 0 0 16
remarks 0 0 16
were 0 0 16
offensive, 0 0 16
and 0 0 16
he 0 0 16
was 0 0 16
exposing 0 0 16
the 0 0 16
audience 0 0 16
to 0 0 16
ideas 0 0 16
that 0 0 16
would 0 0 16
be 0 0 16
found 0 0 16
“in 0 0 16
the 0 0 16
real 0 0 16
world.” 0 0 16
Before 0 0 16
he 0 0 16
could 0 0 16
finish, 0 0 16
Patel’s 0 0 16
microphone 0 0 16
was 0 0 16
cut 0 0 16
from 0 0 16
off-stage, 0 0 16
and 0 0 16
he 0 0 16
proceeded 0 0 16
to 0 0 16
leave. 0 0 16

The 0 0 17

This 0 0 18
is 0 0 18

with 0 0 19

with 0 1 14
the 0 1 14
Clinton’s 0 1 14

They 0 1 15
were 0 1 15

confident 0 1 15
in 0 1 15
that 0 1 15
that 0 1 15

before 0 1 18
numerous 0 1 18

work 0 1 18
on 0 1 18
Russia 0 1 18

during 0 1 18
his 0 1 18

as 0 1 18
an 0 1 18

he 0 1 18

continuing 0 1 18

the 0 1 18
Iranian 0 1 18

According 0 1 19

Campbell 0 1 19
Russia 0 1 19

summary 0 1 20
brief 0 1 20
provided 0 1 20
to 0 1 20
his 0 1 20
former 0 1 20
FBI 0 1 20
handlers 0 1 20
and 0 1 20
obtained 0 1 20
by 0 1 20
this 0 1 20
reporter, 0 1 20
he 0 1 20
stressed 0 1 20
his 0 1 20
deep 0 1 20
concerns 0 1 20
about 0 1 20
Tenex, 0 1 20
a 0 1 20
wholly 0 1 20

its 0 1 20
ongoing 0 1 20
work 0 1 20
to 0 1 20
provide 0 1 20
Iran 0 1 20
with 0 1 20
the 0 1 20
technology 0 1 20
needed 0 1 20
for 0 1 20
its 0 1 20
nuclear 0 1 20
reactor 0 1 20
program. 0 1 20

At 0 1 21
the 0 1 21
time, 0 1 21
Rosatom 0 1 21
was 0 1 21
seeking 0 1 21
the 0 1 21
approval 0 1 21
to 0 1 21
purchase 0 1 21
the 0 1 21
Canadian 0 1 21

“TENEX 0 1 22

through 0 1 22
their 0 1 22
Russian 0 1 22

stated 0 1 22
Campbell 0 1 22
in 0 1 22
a 0 1 22
2010 0 1 22
brief 0 1 22
provided 0 1 22
to 0 1 22
the 0 1 22
FBI. 0 1 22

TVEL 0 1 23
is 0 1 23

are 0 1 25
arranged 0 1 25
inside 0 1 25

help 0 1 25
and 0 1 25
consult 0 1 25
of 0 1 25
TVEL.” 0 1 25
Campbell 0 1 25
informed 0 1 25
the 0 1 25
FBI 0 1 25
of 0 1 25
the 0 1 25
close 0 1 25
relationship 0 1 25
between 0 1 25
TVEL 0 1 25
and 0 1 25
TENEX, 0 1 25
both 0 1 25
a 0 1 25
part 0 1 25
of 0 1 25
the 0 1 25
Rosatom 0 1 25
group. 0 1 25

He 0 1 26
stated 0 1 26
in 0 1 26
his 0 1 26
brief 0 1 26
that 0 1 26
while 0 1 26
spending 0 1 26
time 0 1 26
with 0 1 26
the 0 1 26
Russian 0 1 26
executives 0 1 26
from 0 1 26
both 0 1 26
Rosatom 0 1 26
and 0 1 26
Tenex, 0 1 26
that 0 1 26
any 0 1 26
mention 0 1 26
of 0 1 26
“TVEL 0 1 26
is 0 1 26
a 0 1 26
subject 0 1 26
that 0 1 26
is 0 1 26
serious 0 1 26
to 0 1 26
all 0 1 26
when 0 1 26
mentioned. 0 1 26

I 0 1 27
do 0 1 27
not 0 1 27
even 0 1 27
raise 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
subject 0 1 27
of 0 1 27
TVEL 0 1 27
to 0 1 27
our 0 1 27
friends, 0 1 27
but 0 1 27
occasionally 0 1 27
they 0 1 27
speak 0 1 27
of 0 1 27
it 0 1 27
and 0 1 27
always 0 1 27
in 0 1 27
a 0 1 27
guarded 0 1 27
manner.” 0 1 27
In 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
briefs, 0 1 27
he 0 1 27
informed 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
FBI 0 1 27
that 0 1 27
“occasionally 0 1 27
someone 0 1 27
will 0 1 27
mention 0 1 27
having 0 1 27
been 0 1 27
in 0 1 27
Iran 0 1 27
but 0 1 27
usually 0 1 27
it 0 1 27
is 0 1 27
long 0 1 27
after 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
fact.” 0 1 27
And 0 1 27
when 0 1 27
he 0 1 27
asked 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
Russians 0 1 27
about 0 1 27
these 0 1 27
connections, 0 1 27
he 0 1 27
stated 0 1 27
that 0 1 27
they 0 1 27
“occasionally 0 1 27
speak 0 1 27
of 0 1 27
the 0 1 27
relationship, 0 1 27
i.e. 0 1 27

equipment, 0 1 28
consulting. 0 1 28

I 0 1 29
asked 0 1 29
Vadim 0 1 29
(Mikerin) 0 1 29
if 0 1 29
they 0 1 29
felt 0 1 29
there 0 1 29
was 0 1 29
a 0 1 29
serious 0 1 29
problem, 0 1 29
and 0 1 29
would 0 1 29
they 0 1 29
adhere 0 1 29
to 0 1 29
sanctions 0 1 29
and 0 1 29
western 0 1 29
opinion. 0 1 29

His 0 1 30
response 0 1 30
was 0 1 30
a 0 1 30
smile 0 1 30
and 0 1 30
shoulder 0 1 30
shrug.” 0 1 30
But 0 1 30
Campbell 0 1 30
had 0 1 30
provided 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
FBI 0 1 30
with 0 1 30
evidence 0 1 30
of 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
criminal 0 1 30
network 0 1 30
and 0 1 30
delivered 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
information 0 1 30
to 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
FBI, 0 1 30
which 0 1 30
was 0 1 30
monitoring 0 1 30
his 0 1 30
work 0 1 30
as 0 1 30
an 0 1 30
informant 0 1 30
and 0 1 30
approving 0 1 30
his 0 1 30
transfer 0 1 30
of 0 1 30
bribery 0 1 30
money 0 1 30
to 0 1 30
the 0 1 30
Russians. 0 1 30

Those 0 1 31
transfers, 0 1 31
which 0 1 31
were 0 1 31
made 0 1 31
in 0 1 31
bulk 0 1 31
$50,000 0 1 31
sums 0 1 31
and 0 1 31
at 0 1 31
times 0 1 31
delivered 0 1 31
in 0 1 31
cash, 0 1 31
occurred 0 1 31
between 0 1 31
senior 0 1 31
executives 0 1 31
of 0 1 31
the 0 1 31
American 0 1 31
transportation 0 1 31
company 0 1 31
and 0 1 31
the 0 1 31
Russian 0 1 31
executives 0 1 31
connected 0 1 31
to 0 1 31
Rosatom. 0 1 31

He 0 1 32
had 0 1 32
given 0 1 32
the 0 1 32
FBI 0 1 32
irrefutable 0 1 32
evidence 0 1 32
showing 0 1 32
how 0 1 32
contracts 0 1 32
obtained 0 1 32
from 0 1 32
the 0 1 32
same 0 1 32
Russian 0 1 32
energy 0 1 32
company 0 1 32
Tenex, 0 1 32
were 0 1 32
based 0 1 32
on 0 1 32
contract 0 1 32
bribery 0 1 32
and 0 1 32
other 0 1 32
nefarious 0 1 32
actions, 0 1 32
he 0 1 32
said. 0 1 32

Senior 0 1 33
members 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
the 0 1 33
FBI, 0 1 33
Department 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
Treasury, 0 1 33
Department 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
Energy 0 1 33
and 0 1 33
Department 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
Justice 0 1 33
were 0 1 33
also 0 1 33
briefed 0 1 33
on 0 1 33
Campbell’s 0 1 33
information 0 1 33
and 0 1 33
were 0 1 33
apprised 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
the 0 1 33
various 0 1 33
facets 0 1 33
pertaining 0 1 33
to 0 1 33
Russia’s 0 1 33
acquisition 0 1 33
of 0 1 33
the 0 1 33
Canadian 0 1 33
company. 0 1 33

In 0 1 34
fact, 0 1 34
Campbell 0 1 34
had 0 1 34
been 0 1 34
told 0 1 34
by 0 1 34
his 0 1 34
FBI 0 1 34
handlers 0 1 34
that 0 1 34
his 0 1 34
work 0 1 34
had 0 1 34
made 0 1 34
it 0 1 34
at 0 1 34
least 0 1 34
twice 0 1 34
into 0 1 34
President 0 1 34
Obama’s 0 1 34
classified 0 1 34
presidential 0 1 34
daily 0 1 34
briefings. 0 1 34

Of 1 1 35
course, 1 1 35
we 1 1 35
know 1 1 35
what 1 1 35
Obama 1 1 35
did 1 1 35
with 1 1 35
his 1 1 35
daily 1 1 35
briefings. 1 1 35

They 1 1 36
are 1 1 36
somewhere 1 1 36
in 1 1 36
the 1 1 36
White 1 1 36
House 1 1 36
sewer 1 1 36
system. 1 1 36

Campbell's 0 1 37
work 0 1 37
has 0 1 37
resulted 0 1 37
in 0 1 37
real 0 1 37
justice 0 1 37
being 0 1 37
administered. 0 1 37

In 0 1 38
January, 0 1 38
I 0 1 38
reported: 0 1 38

On 0 1 39
Friday, 0 1 39
the 0 1 39
Justice 0 1 39
Department 0 1 39
unsealed 0 1 39
an 0 1 39
11-count 0 1 39
indictment 0 1 39
concerning 0 1 39
the 0 1 39
Uranium 0 1 39
One 0 1 39
scandal. 0 1 39

Sadly, 0 1 40
it 0 1 40
did 0 1 40
not 0 1 40
include 0 1 40
former 0 1 40
Secretary 0 1 40
of 0 1 40
State 0 1 40
Hillary 0 1 40
Clinton, 0 1 40

Mark 0 1 40
Lambert 0 1 40

Mount 0 1 40
Airy, 0 1 40
Maryland. 0 1 40

Lambert, 0 1 41
54, 0 1 41
was 0 1 41
charged 0 1 41
with 0 1 41
one 0 1 41
count 0 1 41
of 0 1 41
conspiracy 0 1 41
to 0 1 41
violate 0 1 41
the 0 1 41
Foreign 0 1 41
Corrupt 0 1 41
Practices 0 1 41
Act 0 1 41
(FCPA) 0 1 41
and 0 1 41
to 0 1 41
commit 0 1 41
wire 0 1 41
fraud, 0 1 41
seven 0 1 41
counts 0 1 41
of 0 1 41
violating 0 1 41
the 0 1 41
FCPA, 0 1 41
two 0 1 41
counts 0 1 41
of 0 1 41
wire 0 1 41

and 0 1 41
one 0 1 41
count 0 1 41
of 0 1 41
international 0 1 41
promotion 0 1 41
money 0 1 41
laundering. 0 1 41

The 0 1 42
charges 0 1 42
stem 0 1 42
from 0 1 42
an 0 1 42
alleged 0 1 42
scheme 0 1 42
to 0 1 42
bribe 0 1 42

it 0 1 59
emerged 0 1 59
that 0 1 59
Campbell 0 1 59
had 0 1 59

All 0 1 60
of 0 1 60
this 0 1 60
then 0 1 60
goes 0 1 60
back 0 1 60
to 0 1 60
things 0 1 60
we 0 1 60
have 0 1 60
pointed 0 1 60
out 0 1 60
with 0 1 60
ranchers 0 1 60
in 0 1 60
the 0 1 60
western 0 1 60
united 0 1 60
States 0 1 60
and 0 1 60
how 0 1 60
this 0 1 60
impacts 0 1 60
them, 0 1 60
as 0 1 60
well 0 1 60
as 0 1 60
the 0 1 60
land 0 1 60
grabs 0 1 60
that 0 1 60
are 0 1 60
unconstitutionally 0 1 60
orchestrated 0 1 60
by 0 1 60
the 0 1 60

and 0 1 60
the 0 1 60

Management. 0 1 60

There 0 1 61
is 0 1 61
also 0 1 61
substantial 0 1 61
documentation 0 1 61
that 0 1 61
was 0 1 61
discovered 0 1 61
in 0 1 61
Oregon 0 1 61
that 0 1 61
relates 0 1 61
to 0 1 61
this 0 1 61

during 0 1 61
the 0 1 61
Oregon 0 1 61
occupation 0 1 61
in 0 1 61
2016, 0 1 61

got 0 1 61
zero 0 1 61
coverage 0 1 61
in 0 1 61
the 0 1 61

Are 0 1 62
we 0 1 62
about 0 1 62
to 0 1 62

a 0 1 62
serious 0 1 62

all 0 1 62
of 0 1 62
this? 0 1 62

Time 0 1 63
will 0 1 63
tell, 0 1 63
but 0 1 63
I 0 1 63
remain 0 1 63
skeptical, 0 1 63
as 0 1 63
in 0 1 63
the 0 1 63
end, 0 1 63
all 0 1 63
we 0 1 63
ever 0 1 63
get 0 1 63
is 0 1 63
excuses 0 1 63

a 0 2 1

The 0 2 2

is 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
culmination 0 2 2
of 0 2 2
an 0 2 2
18-month 0 2 2

by 0 2 2

state 0 2 2

in 0 2 2

Some 0 2 3

the 0 2 3
300 0 2 3

listed 0 2 3
have 0 2 3
been 0 2 3
redacted 0 2 3

the 0 2 3
report. 0 2 3

Legal 0 2 4
challenges 0 2 4
by 0 2 4
clergy 0 2 4
delayed 0 2 4
the 0 2 4
report’s 0 2 4
release, 0 2 4
after 0 2 4
some 0 2 4
said 0 2 4
it 0 2 4
is 0 2 4
a 0 2 4
violation 0 2 4
of 0 2 4
their 0 2 4
constitutional 0 2 4
rights. 0 2 4

Pennsylvania’s 0 2 5
Supreme 0 2 5
Court 0 2 5
ruled 0 2 5
last 0 2 5
month 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
the 0 2 5

must 0 2 5
be 0 2 5
released 0 2 5
but 0 2 5
with 0 2 5
some 0 2 5
redaction. 0 2 5

The 0 2 6
report’s 0 2 6
release 0 2 6
begins 0 2 6
an 1 2 6
information 1 2 6
war, 1 2 6
with 0 2 6
prosecutors 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
many 0 2 6
victims 0 2 6
saying 0 2 6
it’s 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
start 0 2 6
of 0 2 6
holding 0 2 6
church 0 2 6
leaders 0 2 6
at 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
top 0 2 6
accountable 0 2 6
for 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
first 0 2 6
time, 0 2 6
while 0 2 6
church 0 2 6
lawyers 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
other 0 2 6
advocates 0 2 6
for 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
institution 0 2 6
say 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
report 0 2 6
depicts 0 2 6
an 0 2 6
era 0 2 6
of 0 2 6
another 0 2 6
century, 0 2 6
unfairly 1 2 6
smearing 1 2 6
today’s 0 2 6
Catholicism 0 2 6
in 0 2 6
Pennsylvania. 0 2 6

The 0 2 7
report 0 2 7
has 0 2 7
helped 0 2 7
renew 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
crisis 0 2 7
many 0 2 7
in 0 2 7
the 0 2 7
church 0 2 7
thought 0 2 7
and 0 2 7
hoped 0 2 7
had 0 2 7
ended 0 2 7
nearly 0 2 7
20 0 2 7
years 0 2 7
ago 0 2 7
after 1 2 7
the 1 2 7
scandal 1 2 7
erupted 1 2 7
in 0 2 7
Boston. 0 2 7

recent 1 2 8
abuse-related 1 2 8
scandals, 1 2 8
from 1 2 8
Chile 1 2 8
to 1 2 8

have 1 2 8
reopened 1 2 8
wounding 1 2 8

The 0 2 11

the 0 2 11
resignation 0 2 11
last 0 2 11
month 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
Cardinal 0 2 11
Theodore 0 2 11
McCarrick, 0 2 11
a 1 2 11
towering 1 2 11
figure 1 2 11
in 1 2 11
the 1 2 11
U.S. 1 2 11
church 1 2 11
and 0 2 11
former 0 2 11
D.C. 0 2 11
archbishop 0 2 11
who 0 2 11
was 0 2 11
accused 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
sexually 0 2 11
abusing 0 2 11
minors 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
adults 0 2 11
for 0 2 11

Both 0 2 12
have 0 2 12
further 0 2 12
polarized 0 2 12

church 0 2 12

homosexuality, 0 2 12
celibacy 0 2 12
and 0 2 12
whether 0 2 12
laypeople 0 2 12
should 0 2 12
have 0 2 12
more 0 2 12
power. 0 2 12

It 0 2 13
has 0 2 13
also 0 2 13
triggered 0 2 13
debate 0 2 13
about 0 2 13
whether 0 2 13
statutes 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
limitations 0 2 13
should 0 2 13
be 0 2 13
expanded. 0 2 13

“We’re 0 2 14
dealing 0 2 14
with 0 2 14
a 0 2 14
long-term 0 2 14
struggle 0 2 14
not 0 2 14
only 0 2 14
about 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
meaning 0 2 14
of 0 2 14
justice, 0 2 14
but 0 2 14
about 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
meaning 0 2 14
of 0 2 14
memory,” 0 2 14
said 0 2 14
Jason 0 2 14
Berry, 0 2 14
a 0 2 14
reporter 0 2 14
and 0 2 14
author 0 2 14
who 0 2 14
has 0 2 14
covered 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
sexual 0 2 14
abuse 0 2 14

decades. 0 2 14

“And 1 2 15
how 1 2 15
honest 1 2 15
the 1 2 15
church 1 2 15
has 1 2 15
been 1 2 15
about 1 2 15
this 1 2 15
crisis. 1 2 15

Most 1 2 16
bishops, 1 2 16
besides 1 2 16
apologies, 1 2 16
have 1 2 16
not 1 2 16
been 1 2 16
on 1 2 16
the 1 2 16
cutting 1 2 16
edge 1 2 16
of 1 2 16

Church 0 2 17

began 0 2 17
bracing 0 2 17
for 0 2 17
the 0 2 17

longtime 0 2 18
leader 0 2 18
of 0 2 18
the 0 2 18

warned 0 2 18
his 0 2 18

in 0 2 18
a 0 2 18
letter 0 2 18
that 0 2 18

COMMENT: 0 2 19
The 0 2 19
report 0 2 19

shows 0 2 19
that 0 2 19
“more 0 2 19
than 0 2 19

will 0 2 19
be 0 2 19
listed” 0 2 19
in 0 2 19
Donald 0 2 19
Cardinal 0 2 19
Wuerl’s 0 2 19
former 0 2 19
diocese, 0 2 19
which 0 2 19
is 0 2 19
ironic 0 2 19
since 0 2 19
Wuerl 0 2 19
is 0 2 19
one 0 2 19
of 0 2 19
Pope 0 2 19
Francis’s 0 2 19
closest 0 2 19
U.S. 0 2 19
advisers 0 2 19
and 0 2 19
sits 0 2 19
on 0 2 19
the 0 2 19
Vatican’s 0 2 19
bishop 0 2 19
oversight 0 2 19
committee. 0 2 19

Well 1 2 20
played, 1 2 20
Cardinal 1 2 20
Wuerl! 1 2 20

So, 0 2 21
let 0 2 21
me 0 2 21
get 0 2 21
this 0 2 21
straight 0 2 21
(I 0 2 21
know, 1 2 21
lots 1 2 21
of 1 2 21
luck 1 2 21
with 1 2 21
that 1 2 21
one): 1 2 21
These 1 2 21
are 1 2 21
the 1 2 21
people 1 2 21
that 1 2 21
are 1 2 21
going 1 2 21
to 1 2 21
"accompany 1 2 21
us" 1 2 21
and 1 2 21
our 1 2 21
children 1 2 21
in 1 2 21
the 1 2 21
"synodal 1 2 21
Church" 1 2 21
with 1 2 21
its 1 2 21
new 1 2 21
orientation, 1 2 21
overseen 0 2 21
by 0 2 21
a 1 2 21
"God 1 2 21
of 1 2 21
Surprises" 1 2 21
who 1 2 21
is 1 2 21
uber-merciful 1 2 21
and 1 2 21
doesn't 1 2 21
judge, 1 2 21
and 0 2 21
headed 0 2 21
up 0 2 21
by 0 2 21
a 1 2 21
pope 1 2 21
who, 1 2 21
according 1 2 21
to 1 2 21
Father 1 2 21
Thomas 1 2 21
Rosica, 1 2 21
"breaks 1 2 21
Catholic 1 2 21
traditions 1 2 21
whenever 1 2 21
he 1 2 21
wants, 1 2 21
because 1 2 21
he 1 2 21
is 1 2 21
'free 1 2 21
from 1 2 21
disordered 1 2 21
attachments'?'' 1 2 21

You 1 2 22
don't 1 2 22
say! 1 2 22

All 1 2 23
this 1 2 23
and 1 2 23
rampant 1 2 23
homosexuality 1 2 23
in 1 2 23
the 1 2 23
priesthood, 1 2 23
too... 1 2 23
along 1 2 23
with 1 2 23
a 1 2 23
"trivialized 1 2 23
liturgy" 1 2 23
(according 1 2 23
to 1 2 23
Pope 1 2 23
Benedict 1 2 23
XVI) 1 2 23
and 1 2 23
widespread 1 2 23
apostasy 1 2 23
among 1 2 23
the 1 2 23
faithful? 1 2 23

Remind 1 2 24
me 1 2 24
again: 1 2 24
What 1 2 24
exactly 1 2 24
has 1 2 24
Vatican 1 2 24
II 1 2 24
and 1 2 24
the 1 2 24
last 1 2 24
fifty 1 2 24
years 1 2 24
of 1 2 24
aggiornamento 1 2 24
given 1 2 24
us? 1 2 24

Because 1 2 25
I 1 2 25
can't 1 2 25
seem 1 2 25
to 1 2 25
think 1 2 25
of 1 2 25
a 1 2 25
darn 1 2 25
thing, 1 2 25
apart 1 2 25
from 1 2 25
heretical 1 2 25
homilies, 1 2 25
sodomitical 1 2 25
clergy 1 2 25
and 1 2 25
an 1 2 25
increasingly 1 2 25
lavender 1 2 25
liturgy. 1 2 25

You 1 2 26
know 1 2 26
what, 1 2 26
guys? 1 2 26

Thanks, 1 2 27
but 1 2 27
no 1 2 27
thanks. 1 2 27

You 1 2 28
can 1 2 28
take 1 2 28
your 1 2 28
'Church 1 2 28
of 1 2 28
Accompaniment" 1 2 28
to 1 2 28
prison 1 2 28
with 1 2 28
you. 1 2 28

I'd 1 2 29
sooner 1 2 29
let 1 2 29
my 1 2 29
kids 1 2 29
be 1 2 29
accompanied 1 2 29
by 1 2 29
fans 1 2 29
of 1 2 29
the 1 2 29
Oakland 1 2 29
Raiders 1 2 29
than 1 2 29
turn 1 2 29
them 1 2 29
over 1 2 29
to 1 2 29
you... 1 2 29
meaning 0 2 29
no 0 2 29
disrespect 0 2 29
to 0 2 29

WASHINGTON 0 4 1

President 0 4 1
Donald 0 4 1

his 0 4 1

agency. 0 4 1

Trump 0 4 2
tweeted 0 4 2
last 0 4 2

that 0 4 2
he 0 4 2

Mike 0 4 2

to 0 4 2
be 0 4 2
secretary 0 4 2
of 0 4 2

But 0 4 3
the 0 4 3
president 0 4 3
had 0 4 3
not 0 4 3
sent 0 4 3
the 0 4 3
formal 0 4 3
paperwork 0 4 3
to 0 4 3

a 0 4 4

who 0 4 4
was 0 4 4

authorized 0 4 4

spoke 0 4 4
only 0 4 4
on 0 4 4

Still, 0 4 5
the 0 4 5
delay 0 4 5
prompted 0 4 5
critics 0 4 5
to 0 4 5
speculate 0 4 5
that 0 4 5
the 1 4 5
delay 1 4 5
signaled 1 4 5
the 1 4 5
White 1 4 5

was 1 4 5

Some 0 4 6

and 0 4 6
human 0 4 6

oppose 0 4 6
Haspel’s 0 4 6

That 0 9 10

Experts 0 9 13
say 0 9 13
the 1 9 13

“If 0 9 15

they’re 0 9 15

that 0 15 1

Speaking 0 15 2

Turkey, 0 15 2
Pompeo 0 15 2
offered 0 15 2
that 0 15 2
support 0 15 2
hours 0 15 2

On 0 15 12
his 0 15 12
flight 0 15 12
from 0 15 12
Riyadh 0 15 12
to 0 15 12
Ankara, 0 15 12
Pompeo 1 15 12
reiterated 1 15 12
his 1 15 12
confidence 1 15 12
that 1 15 12
the 1 15 12
Saudi 1 15 12
government 1 15 12
would 1 15 12
conduct 1 15 12
a 1 15 12
“thorough, 1 15 12
complete, 1 15 12
and 1 15 12
transparent 1 15 12
investigation,” 1 15 12
adding 1 15 12
that 1 15 12
they 1 15 12
will 1 15 12
“show 1 15 12
the 1 15 12
entire 1 15 12
world” 1 15 12
the 1 15 12
results. 1 15 12

He 0 15 13
said 0 15 13
Saudi 0 15 13
leaders 0 15 13
made 0 15 13
a 0 15 13
commitment 0 15 13
“to 0 15 13
hold 0 15 13
anyone 0 15 13
connected 0 15 13
to 0 15 13
any 0 15 13
wrongdoing 0 15 13
that 0 15 13
may 0 15 13
be 0 15 13
found 0 15 13
accountable 0 15 13
for 0 15 13
that, 0 15 13
whether 0 15 13
they 0 15 13
are 0 15 13
a 0 15 13
senior 0 15 13
officer 0 15 13
or 0 15 13
official.” 0 15 13
He 0 15 13
said 0 15 13
they 0 15 13
made 0 15 13
“no 0 15 13
exceptions,” 0 15 13
including 0 15 13
presumably 0 15 13
members 0 15 13
of 0 15 13
the 0 15 13
royal 0 15 13
family. 0 15 13

Asked 0 15 14
if 0 15 14
the 0 15 14
Saudis 0 15 14
had 0 15 14
informed 0 15 14
him 0 15 14
whether 0 15 14
Khashoggi 0 15 14
was 0 15 14
alive 0 15 14
or 0 15 14
dead, 0 15 14
Pompeo 0 15 14
said, 0 15 14
“I 0 15 14
don’t 0 15 14
want 0 15 14
to 0 15 14

about 0 15 14
any 0 15 14
of 0 15 14
the 0 15 14
facts. 0 15 14

They 0 15 15
didn’t 0 15 15
want 0 15 15
to 0 15 15
either, 0 15 15
in 0 15 15
that 0 15 15
they 0 15 15
want 0 15 15
to 0 15 15
have 0 15 15
the 0 15 15
opportunity 0 15 15
to 0 15 15

this 0 15 15

in 0 15 15
a 0 15 15
thorough 0 15 15
way.” 0 15 15

Asked 0 15 16
if 0 15 16
he 0 15 16
believed 0 15 16
the 0 15 16
Saudi 0 15 16
rulers’ 0 15 16
repeated 0 15 16
denial 0 15 16
of 0 15 16
complicity, 0 15 16
Pompeo 0 15 16
said 0 15 16
he 0 15 16
was 0 15 16
reserving 0 15 16
judgment. 0 15 16

“I 0 15 17
think 0 15 17
that’s 0 15 17
— 0 15 17
I 0 15 17
think 0 15 17
that’s 0 15 17
— 0 15 17
I 0 15 17
think 0 15 17
that’s 0 15 17
a 0 15 17
reasonable 0 15 17
thing 0 15 17
to 0 15 17
do, 0 15 17
to 0 15 17
give 0 15 17
them 0 15 17
that 0 15 17
opportunity,” 0 15 17
Pompeo 0 15 17
said, 0 15 17
“(and 0 15 17
then) 0 15 17
we’ll 0 15 17
all 0 15 17
get 0 15 17
to 0 15 17
evaluate 0 15 17
the 0 15 17
work 0 15 17
that 0 15 17
they 0 15 17
do.” 0 15 17

Pompeo 0 15 18
refused 0 15 18
to 0 15 18
discuss 0 15 18
possible 0 15 18
consequences 0 15 18
for 0 15 18
those 0 15 18
found 0 15 18
responsible 0 15 18
for 0 15 18
Khashoggi’s 0 15 18
disappearance, 0 15 18
reiterating 0 15 18
at 0 15 18
least 0 15 18
three 0 15 18
times 0 15 18
the 0 15 18
“importance 0 15 18
of 0 15 18
the 0 15 18
investigation.” 0 15 18

Later 0 15 19
Wednesday, 0 15 19
Pompeo 0 15 19
said 0 15 19
during 0 15 19
a 0 15 19
refueling 0 15 19
stopover 0 15 19
in 0 15 19
Brussels 0 15 19
that 0 15 19
Erdogan 0 15 19
had 0 15 19
informed 0 15 19
him 0 15 19
the 0 15 19
Saudis 0 15 19
were 0 15 19
cooperating 0 15 19
with 0 15 19
the 0 15 19
Turkish 0 15 19
investigation 0 15 19
“after 0 15 19
a 0 15 19
couple 0 15 19
of 0 15 19
delays.” 0 15 19

Turkish 0 15 20
officials 0 15 20
“seemed 0 15 20
pretty 0 15 20

the 0 15 20

Pompeo 0 15 20
told 0 15 20

out 0 15 21
of 0 15 21
its 0 15 21
dilemma, 0 15 21
Pompeo 0 15 21
urged 0 15 21
Americans 0 15 21
to 0 15 21
be 0 15 21
mindful 0 15 21
of 0 15 21
the 0 15 21
extensive 0 15 21

Washington, 0 15 21
including 0 15 21
efforts 0 15 21
against 0 15 21
what 0 15 21
he 0 15 21
called 0 15 21
the 0 15 21

largest 0 15 21
supporter 0 15 21
of 0 15 21
terrorism, 0 15 21
Iran. 0 15 21

“The 0 15 22
Saudis 0 15 22
have 0 15 22
been 0 15 22
great 1 15 22
partners 1 15 22
in 0 15 22

on 0 15 22
these 0 15 22

Pompeo 0 15 22
said. 0 15 22

“We 0 15 23
need 0 15 23
to 0 15 23
make 0 15 23
sure 0 15 23
we 0 15 23
are 0 15 23
mindful 0 15 23
of 0 15 23
that 0 15 23
as 0 15 23
we 0 15 23
approach 0 15 23
decisions” 0 15 23
on 0 15 23
whether 0 15 23
to 0 15 23

other 0 15 23
punitive 0 15 23
steps 0 15 23
against 0 15 23

as 0 15 23
many 0 15 23
in 0 15 23
Congress 0 15 23
and 0 15 23
elsewhere 0 15 23
have 0 15 23
urged. 0 15 23

Critics 0 15 24
questioned 0 15 24
whether 0 15 24
the 0 15 24
Saudi 0 15 24
rulers, 0 15 24
who 0 15 24
preside 0 15 24
over 0 15 24
an 0 15 24
authoritarian 0 15 24
regime 0 15 24
that 0 15 24

on 0 15 24
to 0 15 24

a 0 15 24
credible 0 15 24
probe 0 15 24
into 0 15 24
Khashoggi’s 0 15 24
fate 0 15 24
— 0 15 24
especially 0 15 24
without 0 15 24
decisive 0 15 24
pressure 0 15 24
from 0 15 24
their 0 15 24
close 0 15 24
ally, 0 15 24
the 0 15 24
Trump 0 15 24
administration. 0 15 24

Saudi 0 15 25
leaders 0 15 25
for 0 15 25
two 0 15 25
weeks 0 15 25
denied 0 15 25
knowing 0 15 25
anything 0 15 25
about 0 15 25
the 0 15 25
Khashoggi 0 15 25
case. 0 15 25

On 0 15 26
Monday, 0 15 26
they 0 15 26
began 0 15 26
floating 0 15 26
a 0 15 26
scenario 0 15 26
— 0 15 26
initially 0 15 26
adopted 0 15 26
by 0 15 26
Trump 0 15 26
— 0 15 26
that 0 15 26
blamed 0 15 26
the 0 15 26
murder 0 15 26
inside 0 15 26
the 0 15 26
consulate 0 15 26
on 0 15 26
“rogue 0 15 26
killers,” 0 15 26
and 0 15 26
then 0 15 26
suggested 0 15 26
the 0 15 26
writer 0 15 26
was 0 15 26
accidentally 0 15 26
killed 0 15 26
during 0 15 26
an 0 15 26
interrogation 0 15 26
that 0 15 26
went 0 15 26
awry. 0 15 26

Analysts 0 15 27
familiar 0 15 27
with 0 15 27
the 0 15 27
desert 0 15 27
kingdom 0 15 27
said 0 15 27
it 0 15 27
was 0 15 27
likely 0 15 27
Saudi 0 15 27
leaders 0 15 27
were 0 15 27
hoping 0 15 27
the 0 15 27
scandal 0 15 27
would 0 15 27
blow 0 15 27
over 0 15 27
and 0 15 27
that 0 15 27
they 0 15 27
could 0 15 27
wait 0 15 27
it 0 15 27
out. 0 15 27

“We 0 15 28
received 0 15 28
commitments 0 15 28
that 0 15 28
they 0 15 28
would 0 15 28
complete 0 15 28
this 0 15 28
(investigation), 0 15 28

I 0 15 28
am 0 15 28
counting 0 15 28
on 0 15 28
them 0 15 28
to 0 15 28
do 0 15 28
that,” 0 15 28
Pompeo 0 15 28
said. 0 15 28

“They 0 15 29
gave 0 15 29
me 0 15 29

massive 0 17 1
rally 0 17 1
for 0 17 1
Tommy 0 17 1

Saturday. 0 17 1

20,000 0 17 2

out 0 17 2
to 0 17 2
call 0 17 2

Tommy’s 0 17 2
release, 0 17 2
and 0 17 2
Wilders 0 17 2
took 0 17 2
the 0 17 2
opportunity 0 17 2
to 0 17 2
put 0 17 2
the 0 17 2
political 0 17 2

of 0 17 2
Britain 0 17 2
and 0 17 2
continental 0 17 2
Europe 0 17 2
on 0 17 2
notice. 0 17 2

“Our 1 17 3
governments,” 1 17 3
Wilders 0 17 3
declared, 0 17 3
“sold 0 17 3
us 0 17 3
out 0 17 3
with 0 17 3
mass 0 17 3
immigration. 0 17 3

With 0 17 4
Islamization. 0 17 4

With 0 17 5
open 0 17 5
borders. 0 17 5

We 0 17 6
are 0 17 6
almost 0 17 6
foreigners 0 17 6
in 0 17 6
our 0 17 6
own 0 17 6
lands. 0 17 6

And 0 17 7
if 0 17 7
we 0 17 7
complain 0 17 7
about 0 17 7
it, 0 17 7
they 0 17 7
call 0 17 7
us 0 17 7
racists 1 17 7
and 1 17 7
Islamophobes. 1 17 7

But 0 17 8
I 0 17 8
say, 0 17 8
no 1 17 8
more! 1 17 8

And 0 17 9
what 0 17 9
do 0 17 9
you 0 17 9
say? 0 17 9

No 1 17 10
more! 1 17 10

And 0 17 11
that’s 0 17 11
right: 0 17 11
enough 0 17 11
is 0 17 11
enough. 0 17 11

We 0 17 12
will 0 17 12
not 0 17 12
be 0 17 12
gagged 0 17 12
anymore. 0 17 12

No 1 17 13
more 1 17 13
tyranny.” 1 17 13

It 0 17 14
was 0 17 14
extraordinary 0 17 14
that 0 17 14
the 0 17 14
British 0 17 14
authorities 0 17 14
allowed 0 17 14
Wilders 0 17 14
into 0 17 14
the 0 17 14
country 0 17 14
at 0 17 14
all. 0 17 14

Several 0 17 15
years 0 17 15
ago 0 17 15
he 0 17 15
was 0 17 15
banned 0 17 15
from 0 17 15
entering 0 17 15

country, 0 17 15
but 0 17 15
although 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
ban 0 17 15
was 0 17 15
reversed 0 17 15
on 0 17 15
appeal, 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
British 0 17 15
government 0 17 15
recently 0 17 15
banned 0 17 15

and 0 17 15
Lutz 0 17 15
Bachmann 0 17 15
from 0 17 15
entering, 0 17 15
all 0 17 15
for 0 17 15
the 0 17 15
crime 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
opposing 0 17 15
jihad 0 17 15
terror 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
Sharia 0 17 15

and 0 17 15
thereby 0 17 15
made 0 17 15
it 0 17 15
clear 0 17 15
that 0 17 15
it 0 17 15
is 0 17 15
more 0 17 15
authoritarian 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
unwilling 0 17 15

the 0 17 15

when 0 17 15
it 0 17 15
comes 0 17 15
to 0 17 15
criticism 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
Islam, 0 17 15
Muslim 1 17 15
rape 1 17 15
gangs, 1 17 15
and 0 17 15
mass 0 17 15
Muslim 0 17 15
migration. 0 17 15

Even 0 17 16
worse, 0 17 16
the 0 17 16
bannings 0 17 16
of 0 17 16
Sellner, 0 17 16
Pettibone, 0 17 16
Southern, 0 17 16
and 0 17 16
Bachmann 0 17 16
were 0 17 16
just 0 17 16
part 0 17 16
of 0 17 16
a 0 17 16
long 0 17 16
pattern. 0 17 16

Pamela 0 17 17
Geller 0 17 17
and 0 17 17
I 0 17 17
were 0 17 17
banned 0 17 17
from 0 17 17
entering 0 17 17
Britain 0 17 17
in 0 17 17
2013, 0 17 17
apparently 0 17 17
for 0 17 17
life, 0 17 17
also 0 17 17
for 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
crime 0 17 17
of 0 17 17
telling 0 17 17
the 1 17 17
truth 1 17 17
about 1 17 17
Islam 1 17 17
and 1 17 17
jihad. 1 17 17

Meanwhile, 0 17 18
Britain 0 17 18
has 0 17 18
a 0 17 18
steadily 0 17 18
lengthening 0 17 18
record 0 17 18
of 0 17 18
admitting 0 17 18
jihad 0 17 18
preachers 0 17 18
without 1 17 18
a 1 17 18
moment 1 17 18
of 1 17 18
hesitation. 1 17 18

Syed 0 17 19
Muzaffar 0 17 19
Shah 0 17 19
Qadri’s 0 17 19
preaching 1 17 19
of 1 17 19
hatred 1 17 19
and 1 17 19
jihad 1 17 19
violence 1 17 19
was 0 17 19
so 0 17 19
hardline 1 17 19
that 0 17 19
he 0 17 19
was 0 17 19
banned 0 17 19
from 0 17 19
preaching 0 17 19
in 0 17 19
Pakistan, 0 17 19
but 0 17 19
the 0 17 19
UK 0 17 19
Home 0 17 19
Office 0 17 19
welcomed 0 17 19
him 0 17 19
into 0 17 19
Britain. 0 17 19

The 0 17 20
UK 0 17 20
Home 0 17 20
Office 0 17 20
also 0 17 20
admitted 0 17 20
Shaykh 0 17 20
Hamza 0 17 20
Sodagar 0 17 20
into 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
country, 0 17 20
despite 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
fact 0 17 20
that 0 17 20
he 0 17 20
has 0 17 20
said: 0 17 20
“If 0 17 20
there’s 0 17 20
homosexual 0 17 20
men, 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
punishment 0 17 20
is 0 17 20
one 0 17 20
of 0 17 20
five 0 17 20
things. 0 17 20

One 0 17 21
– 0 17 21
the 0 17 21
easiest 0 17 21
one 0 17 21
maybe 0 17 21
– 0 17 21
chop 0 17 21
their 0 17 21
head 0 17 21
off, 0 17 21
that’s 0 17 21
the 0 17 21
easiest. 0 17 21

Second 0 17 22
– 0 17 22
burn 0 17 22
them 0 17 22
to 0 17 22
death. 0 17 22

Third 0 17 23
– 0 17 23
throw 0 17 23
’em 0 17 23
off 0 17 23
a 0 17 23
cliff. 0 17 23

Fourth 0 17 24
– 0 17 24
tear 0 17 24
down 0 17 24
a 0 17 24
wall 0 17 24
on 0 17 24
them 0 17 24
so 0 17 24
they 0 17 24
die 0 17 24
under 0 17 24
that. 0 17 24

Fifth 0 17 25
– 0 17 25
a 0 17 25
combination 0 17 25
of 0 17 25
the 0 17 25
above.” 0 17 25

Theresa 0 17 26
May’s 0 17 26
relentlessly 1 17 26
appeasement-minded 1 17 26
government 0 17 26
also 0 17 26
admitted 0 17 26
two 0 17 26
jihad 0 17 26
preachers 0 17 26
who 0 17 26
had 0 17 26
praised 0 17 26
the 0 17 26
murderer 0 17 26
of 0 17 26
a 0 17 26
foe 0 17 26
of 0 17 26
Pakistan’s 0 17 26
blasphemy 0 17 26
laws. 0 17 26

One 0 17 27
of 0 17 27
them 0 17 27
was 0 17 27
welcomed 0 17 27
by 0 17 27
the 0 17 27
Archbishop 0 17 27
of 0 17 27
Canterbury. 0 17 27

Meanwhile, 0 17 28
the 0 17 28
UK 0 17 28
banned 0 17 28
three 0 17 28
bishops 0 17 28
from 0 17 28
areas 0 17 28
of 0 17 28
Iraq 0 17 28
and 0 17 28
Syria 0 17 28
where 0 17 28
Christians 0 17 28
are 0 17 28
persecuted 0 17 28
from 0 17 28
entering 0 17 28
the 0 17 28
country. 0 17 28

But 0 17 29
now 0 17 29
matters 0 17 29
are 0 17 29
coming 0 17 29
to 0 17 29
a 0 17 29
head. 0 17 29

Apparently 0 17 30
British 0 17 30
authorities 0 17 30
decided 0 17 30
that 0 17 30
it 0 17 30
would 0 17 30
be 0 17 30
too 0 17 30
politically 0 17 30
costly 0 17 30
for 0 17 30
them 0 17 30
to 0 17 30
bar 0 17 30
Wilders 0 17 30
again. 0 17 30

And 0 17 31
so 0 17 31
he 0 17 31
entered, 0 17 31
and 0 17 31
spoke, 0 17 31
and 0 17 31
gave 0 17 31
them 0 17 31
a 0 17 31
strong 0 17 31
dose 0 17 31
of 0 17 31
the 0 17 31
reality 1 17 31
that 0 17 31
they 0 17 31
are 0 17 31
determined 0 17 31
to 0 17 31
ignore 0 17 31
and 0 17 31
deny. 0 17 31

Tommy 0 17 32
Robinson 0 17 32
is 0 17 32
in 0 17 32
prison 0 17 32
today 0 17 32
because 0 17 32
he 0 17 32
violated 0 17 32
a 0 17 32
court 0 17 32
order 0 17 32
demanding 0 17 32
that 0 17 32
he 0 17 32
not 0 17 32
film 0 17 32
videos 0 17 32
outside 0 17 32
the 0 17 32
trials 0 17 32
of 0 17 32
Muslim 1 17 32
rape 1 17 32
gangs. 1 17 32

Clearly 0 17 33
the 1 17 33
government’s 1 17 33
intent 1 17 33
was 1 17 33
to 1 17 33
make 1 17 33
sure 1 17 33
that 1 17 33
as 1 17 33
few 1 17 33
people 1 17 33
as 1 17 33
possible 1 17 33
discovered 1 17 33
the 1 17 33
truth 1 17 33
about 0 17 33
its 0 17 33
massive, 0 17 33
years-long 0 17 33
cover-up 0 17 33
of 0 17 33
those 0 17 33
rape 1 17 33
gangs, 1 17 33
and 0 17 33
refusal 0 17 33
to 0 17 33
prosecute 0 17 33
the 0 17 33
perpetrators. 0 17 33

Theresa 0 17 34
May 0 17 34
and 0 17 34
company 0 17 34
obvious 0 17 34
hope 0 17 34
that 0 17 34
other 0 17 34
Britons 0 17 34
who 0 17 34
are 0 17 34
furious 0 17 34
about 0 17 34
the 0 17 34
sacrifice 1 17 34
of 1 17 34
thousands 1 17 34
of 0 17 34
British 1 17 34
girls 1 17 34
to 0 17 34
the 0 17 34
idols 0 17 34
of 0 17 34
“diversity” 0 17 34
and 0 17 34
“multiculturalism” 0 17 34
will 0 17 34
see 0 17 34
what 0 17 34
happened 0 17 34
to 0 17 34
Tommy, 0 17 34
and 0 17 34
be 0 17 34
frightened 0 17 34
into 0 17 34
silence. 0 17 34

The 0 17 35
British 0 17 35
government, 0 17 35
in 0 17 35
imprisoning 0 17 35
Tommy 0 17 35
Robinson, 0 17 35
has 0 17 35
shown 0 17 35
itself 0 17 35
willing 0 17 35
to 0 17 35
incarcerate 0 17 35
people 0 17 35
for 0 17 35
having 0 17 35
opinions 0 17 35
that 0 17 35
it 0 17 35
considers 0 17 35
unacceptable. 0 17 35

That 0 17 36
heralds 0 17 36
the 1 17 36
death 1 17 36
of 1 17 36
Britain 1 17 36
as 1 17 36
a 1 17 36
free 1 17 36
society 1 17 36
and 0 17 36
the 0 17 36
beginning 1 17 36
of 1 17 36
an 1 17 36
authoritarian 1 17 36
police 1 17 36
state 1 17 36
there, 0 17 36
unless 1 17 36
this 1 17 36
slide 1 17 36
to 1 17 36
totalitarianism 1 17 36
is 1 17 36
stopped 1 17 36
now. 1 17 36

British 0 17 37
public 0 17 37
figures, 0 17 37
whatever 0 17 37
criticism 0 17 37
they 0 17 37
have 0 17 37
leveled 0 17 37
against 0 17 37
Tommy 0 17 37
Robinson 0 17 37
in 0 17 37
the 0 17 37
past, 0 17 37
should 0 17 37
be 0 17 37
calling 0 17 37
for 0 17 37
him 0 17 37
to 0 17 37
be 0 17 37
freed 0 17 37
today, 0 17 37
or 1 17 37
else 1 17 37
they 1 17 37
will 1 17 37
be 1 17 37
exposing 1 17 37
themselves 1 17 37
as 1 17 37
supporting 1 17 37
the 1 17 37
degeneration 1 17 37
of 1 17 37
Britain 1 17 37
into 0 17 37
a 0 17 37
police 0 17 37
state. 0 17 37

Wilders 0 17 38
addressed 0 17 38
this 0 17 38
endeavor 0 17 38
head-on, 0 17 38
declaring: 0 17 38
“We 1 17 38
will 1 17 38
not 1 17 38
be 1 17 38
silenced. 1 17 38

We 1 17 39
will 1 17 39
not 1 17 39
be 1 17 39
intimidated. 1 17 39

And 1 17 40
we 1 17 40
tell 1 17 40
the 1 17 40
governments, 1 17 40
we 1 17 40
are 1 17 40
not 1 17 40
afraid 1 17 40
of 1 17 40
you. 1 17 40

We 1 17 41
will 1 17 41
never 1 17 41
surrender. 1 17 41

We 1 17 42
will 1 17 42
stand 1 17 42
strong 1 17 42
and 1 17 42
do 1 17 42
our 1 17 42
duty. 1 17 42

We 1 17 43
will 1 17 43
defend 1 17 43
our 1 17 43
civilization. 1 17 43

And 1 17 44
we 1 17 44
will 1 17 44
protect 1 17 44
our 1 17 44
people.” 1 17 44

Wilders 0 17 45
added: 0 17 45
“And 0 17 45
I 0 17 45
tell 0 17 45
you, 0 17 45
to 0 17 45
the 0 17 45
governments. 0 17 45

You 0 17 46
can 0 17 46
throw 0 17 46
us 0 17 46
in 0 17 46
jail, 0 17 46
but 0 17 46
you 0 17 46
will 0 17 46
never 0 17 46
defeat 0 17 46
us. 0 17 46

Because, 0 17 47
my 0 17 47
friends, 0 17 47
for 0 17 47
every 0 17 47
Tommy 0 17 47
whom 0 17 47
you 0 17 47
imprison, 0 17 47
thousands 0 17 47
will 0 17 47
rise 0 17 47
up. 0 17 47

So 0 17 48
take 1 17 48
notice, 1 17 48
Theresa 0 17 48
May. 0 17 48

Take 1 17 49
notice, 1 17 49
Dutch 0 17 49
Prime 0 17 49
Minister 0 17 49
Rutte. 0 17 49

Take 1 17 50
notice, 1 17 50
Mrs. 0 17 50
Merkel 0 17 50
or 0 17 50
President 0 17 50
Macron. 0 17 50

Take 1 17 51
notice: 1 17 51
the 1 17 51
future 1 17 51
is 1 17 51
ours 1 17 51
and 1 17 51
not 1 17 51
yours. 1 17 51

We 0 17 52
will 0 17 52
defeat 0 17 52
you 0 17 52
politically, 0 17 52
because 0 17 52
we, 0 17 52
my 0 17 52
friends, 0 17 52
we 1 17 52
are 1 17 52
the 1 17 52
people.” 1 17 52

If 1 17 53
Wilders’ 1 17 53
words 1 17 53
don’t 1 17 53
prove 1 17 53
true, 1 17 53
it 1 17 53
will 1 17 53
be 1 17 53
because 1 17 53
the 1 17 53
death 1 17 53
of 1 17 53
free 1 17 53
societies 1 17 53
in 1 17 53
Britain 1 17 53
and 1 17 53
Western 1 17 53
Europe 1 17 53
is 1 17 53
truly 1 17 53
at 1 17 53
hand. 1 17 53

He 0 18 11

He 0 18 13
again 0 18 13

that 0 18 13

back 0 18 13
more 0 18 13
than 0 18 13
80 0 18 13

The 0 18 14

reluctance 0 18 14
to 0 18 14
condemn 0 18 14
the 0 18 14

has 0 18 14

Republicans 0 18 14
in 0 18 14
Congress, 0 18 14
from 0 18 14

and 0 18 14
from 0 18 14
even 0 18 14
some 0 18 14

that 0 18 14
long 0 18 14
have 0 18 14
profited 0 18 14

“We 0 18 15

it 0 20 11

fact 0 23 2
that 0 23 2

in 0 23 2

Jeff 0 23 3
begins 0 23 3
the 0 23 3
interview 0 23 3
by 0 23 3
making 0 23 3
clear 0 23 3
his 0 23 3
belief 0 23 3
that 0 23 3
there 0 23 3
were 0 23 3
multiple 0 23 3
active 0 23 3
shooters 0 23 3
targeting 0 23 3
different 0 23 3
places 0 23 3
in 0 23 3
Las 0 23 3
Vegas 0 23 3
on 0 23 3
the 0 23 3
night 0 23 3
of 0 23 3
the 0 23 3
attack. 0 23 3

“First 0 23 4
of 0 23 4
all, 0 23 4
I 0 23 4
think 0 23 4
what 0 23 4
needs 0 23 4
to 0 23 4
be 0 23 4
said 0 23 4
is 0 23 4
that, 0 23 4
from 0 23 4
my 0 23 4
perspective, 0 23 4
there 0 23 4
were 0 23 4
multiple 0 23 4
events 0 23 4
that 0 23 4
occurred 0 23 4
around 0 23 4
Las 0 23 4
Vegas, 0 23 4
up 0 23 4
and 0 23 4
down 0 23 4
the 0 23 4
Strip 0 23 4
that 0 23 4
night. 0 23 4

It 0 23 5
wasn’t 0 23 5
just 0 23 5
centralized 0 23 5
around 0 23 5
the 0 23 5
Mandalay 0 23 5
Hotel,” 0 23 5
the 0 23 5
witness 0 23 5
claimed. 0 23 5

The 0 23 6
eyewitness 0 23 6
then 0 23 6
goes 0 23 6
on 0 23 6
to 0 23 6
directly 0 23 6
say 0 23 6
that 0 23 6
he 0 23 6
and 0 23 6
his 0 23 6
wife 0 23 6
were 0 23 6
involved 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
an 0 23 6
active 0 23 6
shooter 0 23 6
situation 0 23 6
at 0 23 6
a 0 23 6
different 0 23 6
hotel 0 23 6
that 0 23 6
authorities 0 23 6
have 0 23 6
so 0 23 6
far 0 23 6
done 0 23 6
everything 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
their 0 23 6
power 0 23 6
to 0 23 6
cover-up. 0 23 6

“My 0 23 7
wife 0 23 7
and 0 23 7
I 0 23 7
were 0 23 7
in 0 23 7
Las 0 23 7
Vegas 0 23 7
celebrating 0 23 7
our 0 23 7
10th 0 23 7
anniversary 0 23 7
and 0 23 7
on 0 23 7
October 0 23 7
1st 0 23 7
we 0 23 7
were 0 23 7
involved 0 23 7
in 0 23 7
an 0 23 7
incident 0 23 7
with 0 23 7
an 0 23 7
active 0 23 7
shooter 0 23 7
at 0 23 7
the 0 23 7
Bellagio. 0 23 7

There 0 23 8
is 0 23 8
no 0 23 8
mistake 0 23 8
in 0 23 8
my 0 23 8
mind 0 23 8
about 0 23 8
it,” 0 23 8
he 0 23 8
continued. 0 23 8

Jeff 0 23 9
then 0 23 9
describes 0 23 9
a 0 23 9
scene 0 23 9
in 0 23 9
which 0 23 9
he 0 23 9
and 0 23 9
his 0 23 9
wife 0 23 9
were 0 23 9
walking 0 23 9
through 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
main 0 23 9
lobby 0 23 9
when 0 23 9
screams 0 23 9
and 0 23 9
gunfire 0 23 9
erupted. 0 23 9

Keep 1 23 10
in 1 23 10
mind, 1 23 10
this 1 23 10
is 1 23 10
all 1 23 10
information 1 23 10
that 1 23 10
the 1 23 10
police 1 23 10
and 1 23 10
the 1 23 10
FBI 1 23 10
has 1 23 10
hidden 1 23 10
from 1 23 10
the 1 23 10
American 1 23 10
people. 1 23 10

“All 0 23 11
of 0 23 11
a 0 23 11
sudden 0 23 11
there 0 23 11
was 0 23 11
just 0 23 11
a 0 23 11
crescendo 0 23 11
of 0 23 11
screams 0 23 11
that 0 23 11
started 0 23 11
behind 0 23 11
us 0 23 11
in 0 23 11
the 0 23 11
lobby,” 0 23 11
he 0 23 11
claimed. 0 23 11

“Then 0 23 12
I 0 23 12
heard 0 23 12
somebody 0 23 12
yell 0 23 12
‘there’s 0 23 12
a 0 23 12
shooter! 0 23 12

There’s 0 23 13
a 0 23 13
shooter!’ 0 23 13
And 0 23 13
then 0 23 13
I 0 23 13
heard 0 23 13
like 0 23 13
five 0 23 13
or 0 23 13
six 0 23 13
pops, 0 23 13
like 0 23 13
unmistakable 0 23 13
gunfire, 0 23 13
unmistakably.” 0 23 13

“That 0 23 14
was 0 23 14
about 0 23 14
11:20 0 23 14
when 0 23 14
we 0 23 14
heard 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
shots 0 23 14
and 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
screams… 0 23 14
at 0 23 14
that 0 23 14
point 0 23 14
you 0 23 14
could 0 23 14
hear 0 23 14
and 0 23 14
see 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
screams 0 23 14
and 0 23 14
see 0 23 14
hundreds 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
people 0 23 14
coming 0 23 14
towards 0 23 14
us.” 0 23 14

Amazingly, 0 23 15
as 0 23 15
Shepard 0 23 15
Ambellas 0 23 15
noted, 0 23 15
“The 0 23 15
man’s 0 23 15
claims 0 23 15
match 0 23 15
up 0 23 15
to 0 23 15
actual 0 23 15
events 0 23 15
captured 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
police 0 23 15
audio 0 23 15
recordings 0 23 15
from 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
night 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
shooting 0 23 15
which 0 23 15
confirms 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
between 0 23 15
11:15 0 23 15
and 0 23 15
11:18 0 23 15
p.m. 0 23 15
on 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
night 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
Oct. 0 23 15
1 0 23 15
there 0 23 15
was, 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
fact, 0 23 15
something 0 23 15
going 0 23 15
on 0 23 15
at 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
Bellagio.” 0 23 15

This 0 23 16
testimony 0 23 16
also 0 23 16
backs 0 23 16
up 0 23 16
claims 0 23 16
by 0 23 16
another 0 23 16
eyewitness, 0 23 16
Rene 0 23 16
Downs, 0 23 16
who 0 23 16
has 0 23 16
spent 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
past 0 23 16
few 0 23 16
days 0 23 16
doing 0 23 16
interviews 0 23 16
about 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
shooter 0 23 16
inside 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Bellagio 0 23 16
Hotel. 0 23 16

Slowly 1 23 17
but 1 23 17
surely 1 23 17
we 0 23 17
are 0 23 17
starting 0 23 17
to 0 23 17
see 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
official 0 23 17
narrative 0 23 17
regarding 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Las 0 23 17
Vegas 0 23 17
Massacre 0 23 17
be 0 23 17
completely 0 23 17
destroyed. 0 23 17

At 0 23 18
this 0 23 18
point 0 23 18
it 1 23 18
is 1 23 18
strikingly 1 23 18
obvious 1 23 18
that 1 23 18
authorities 1 23 18
have 1 23 18
lied 1 23 18
to 1 23 18
the 1 23 18
American 1 23 18
people 1 23 18
about 0 23 18
the 0 23 18
worst 0 23 18
mass 0 23 18
shooting 0 23 18
in 0 23 18
our 0 23 18
countries 0 23 18
history. 0 23 18

One 1 23 19
can 1 23 19
only 1 23 19
speculate 1 23 19
as 1 23 19
to 1 23 19
what 1 23 19
the 1 23 19
reasons 1 23 19
for 1 23 19
these 1 23 19

are? 1 23 19

We 0 24 1
have 0 24 1
had 0 24 1
the 0 24 1
Islamic 0 24 1
State 0 24 1
claim 0 24 1
over 0 24 1
and 0 24 1
over 0 24 1
that 0 24 1
they 0 24 1
were 0 24 1
taking 0 24 1
credit 0 24 1
for 0 24 1
the 0 24 1
mass 0 24 1

that 0 24 1

on 0 24 1

that 0 24 1

was 0 24 1
a 0 24 1
recent 0 24 1
convert 0 24 1
to 0 24 1
Islam. 0 24 1

Now, 0 24 2
a 0 24 2
congressman 0 24 2
is 0 24 2
saying 0 24 2
there 0 24 2
is 0 24 2

of 0 24 2

is 0 24 2
related 0 24 2
to 0 24 2
the 0 24 2
Las 0 24 2
Vegas 0 24 2
shooting. 0 24 2

If 0 24 3
you 0 24 3
recall, 0 24 3
the 0 24 3
Islamic 0 24 3
State 0 24 3
has 0 24 3
never 0 24 3
claimed 0 24 3

for 0 24 3

they 0 24 3

telling 0 24 6
the 0 24 6
truth 0 24 6
and 0 24 6
that 0 24 6
they 0 24 6
may 0 24 6
actually 0 24 6
have 0 24 6
been 0 24 6
involved 0 24 6
in 0 24 6
the 0 24 6
deadly 0 24 6
attack. 0 24 6

Perry 0 24 7
brought 0 24 7
up 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
fact 0 24 7
that 0 24 7
we 0 24 7
can't 0 24 7
seem 0 24 7
to 0 24 7
get 0 24 7
information 0 24 7
in 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
case 0 24 7
that 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
public 0 24 7
needs 0 24 7
to 0 24 7
be 0 24 7
made 0 24 7
aware 0 24 7
of, 0 24 7
something 0 24 7
that 0 24 7
was 0 24 7
brought 0 24 7
up 0 24 7
in 0 24 7
a 0 24 7
district 0 24 7
courtroom 0 24 7
earlier 0 24 7
this 0 24 7
week. 0 24 7

Additionally, 0 24 8
the 0 24 8
family 0 24 8
of 0 24 8
Stephen 0 24 8
Paddock 0 24 8
just 0 24 8
received 0 24 8
his 0 24 8
cremated 0 24 8
remains 0 24 8
on 0 24 8
Thursday 0 24 8
and 0 24 8
his 0 24 8
brother 0 24 8
said 0 24 8
that 0 24 8
the 0 24 8
family 0 24 8
has 0 24 8
yet 0 24 8
to 0 24 8
receive 0 24 8
an 0 24 8
autopsy 0 24 8
report. 0 24 8

Why 0 24 9
is 0 24 9
that? 0 24 9

Everyone 0 24 10
who 0 24 10
was 0 24 10
killed 0 24 10
that 0 24 10
night 0 24 10
had 0 24 10
autopsies 0 24 10
and 0 24 10
those 0 24 10
have 0 24 10
been 0 24 10
released. 0 24 10

We're 0 24 11
told 0 24 11
Paddock 0 24 11
shot 0 24 11
himself 0 24 11
in 0 24 11
the 0 24 11
head, 0 24 11
right? 0 24 11

Why 1 24 12
would 1 24 12
the 1 24 12
autopsy 1 24 12
report 1 24 12
be 1 24 12
something 1 24 12
that 1 24 12
needs 1 24 12
to 1 24 12
be 1 24 12
withheld 1 24 12
from 1 24 12
the 1 24 12
public 1 24 12
or 1 24 12
his 1 24 12
family? 1 24 12

"Recently 0 24 13
I’ve 0 24 13
been 0 24 13
made 0 24 13
aware 0 24 13
of 0 24 13
what 0 24 13
I 0 24 13
believe 0 24 13
to 0 24 13
be 0 24 13
credible 1 24 13
evidence 1 24 13
regarding 0 24 13
potential 0 24 13
terrorist 0 24 13
infiltration 0 24 13
through 0 24 13
the 0 24 13
southern 0 24 13
border 0 24 13
regarding 0 24 13
this 0 24 13
incident," 0 24 13
Perry 0 24 13
said. 0 24 13

"Twice 0 24 14
before 0 24 14
the 0 24 14
attack, 0 24 14
ISIS 0 24 14
warned 0 24 14
the 0 24 14
United 0 24 14
States 0 24 14
they 0 24 14
would 0 24 14
attack 0 24 14
Las 0 24 14
Vegas," 0 24 14
he 0 24 14
added. 0 24 14

"In 0 24 15
June 0 24 15
and 0 24 15
August." 0 24 15

"And 0 24 16
then 0 24 16
after 0 24 16
the 0 24 16
attack 0 24 16
claimed 0 24 16
responsibility 0 24 16
four 0 24 16
times," 0 24 16
Perry 0 24 16
continued. 0 24 16

"Something’s 1 24 17
not 1 24 17
adding 1 24 17
up." 1 24 17

"I’m 0 24 18
just 0 24 18
telling 0 24 18
you 0 24 18
I 0 24 18
have 0 24 18
received 0 24 18
what 0 24 18
I 0 24 18
feel 0 24 18
to 0 24 18
be 0 24 18
and 0 24 18
believe 0 24 18
to 0 24 18
be 0 24 18
credible 0 24 18
evidence 0 24 18
of 0 24 18
a 0 24 18
possible 0 24 18
terrorist 0 24 18
nexus," 0 24 18
Perry 0 24 18
said. 0 24 18

The 0 24 19
investigation 0 24 19
has 0 24 19
been 0 24 19
conducted 0 24 19
by 0 24 19
local 0 24 19
and 0 24 19
state 0 24 19
police, 0 24 19
not 0 24 19
the 0 24 19
feds, 0 24 19
and 0 24 19
yet, 0 24 19
they 0 24 19
continue 0 24 19
to 0 24 19
claim 0 24 19
there 0 24 19
is 0 24 19
not 0 24 19
Islamic 0 24 19
terrorist 0 24 19
involvement. 0 24 19

Yet, 0 24 20
though 0 24 20
they 0 24 20
claim 0 24 20
that 0 24 20
Paddock 0 24 20
was 0 24 20
a 0 24 20
lone 0 24 20
gunman, 0 24 20
they 0 24 20
continue 0 24 20
to 0 24 20
withhold 0 24 20
video 0 24 20
of 0 24 20
him 0 24 20
in 0 24 20
Mandalay 0 24 20
Bay 0 24 20
because 0 24 20
they 0 24 20
are 0 24 20
still 0 24 20
investigating 0 24 20
other 0 24 20
suspects 0 24 20
to 0 24 20
charge 0 24 20
in 0 24 20
the 0 24 20
shooting. 0 24 20

And 0 24 21
no 0 24 21
one 0 24 21
seems 0 24 21
to 0 24 21
know 0 24 21
where 0 24 21
alleged 0 24 21
Mandalay 0 24 21
Bay 0 24 21
security 0 24 21
guard 0 24 21
Jesus 0 24 21
Campos 0 24 21
is 0 24 21
either. 0 24 21

None 0 24 22
of 0 24 22
this 0 24 22
is 0 24 22
really 0 24 22
that 0 24 22
surprising. 0 24 22

If 0 24 23
you 0 24 23
recall, 0 24 23
we 0 24 23
reported 0 24 23
on 0 24 23
Islamic 0 24 23
terrorists 0 24 23
settling 0 24 23
into 0 24 23
Mexico 0 24 23
and 0 24 23
crossing 0 24 23
the 0 24 23
border 0 24 23
some 0 24 23
years 0 24 23
back 0 24 23
and 0 24 23
that 0 24 23
came 0 24 23
out 0 24 23
as 0 24 23
the 0 24 23
infamous 0 24 23
"Gang 0 24 23
of 0 24 23
Eight" 0 24 23
were 0 24 23
working 0 24 23
on 0 24 23
an 0 24 23
immigration 0 24 23
deal 0 24 23
and 0 24 23
had 0 24 23
rejected 0 24 23
building 0 24 23
the 0 24 23
700 0 24 23
miles 0 24 23
of 0 24 23
double-tier 0 24 23
border 0 24 23
fencing 0 24 23
Congress 0 24 23
authorized 0 24 23
just 0 24 23
seven 0 24 23
years 0 24 23
ago, 0 24 23
with 0 24 23
a 0 24 23
majority 0 24 23
of 0 24 23
the 0 24 23
Senate 0 24 23
saying 0 24 23
they 0 24 23
didn't 0 24 23
want 0 24 23
to 0 24 23
delay 0 24 23
granting 0 24 23
illegal 0 24 23
immigrants 0 24 23
legal 0 24 23
status 0 24 23
while 0 24 23
the 0 24 23
fence 0 24 23
was 0 24 23
being 0 24 23
built. 0 24 23

Three 0 24 24
years 0 24 24
prior 0 24 24
to 0 24 24
that 0 24 24
report, 0 24 24
there 0 24 24
was 0 24 24
a 0 24 24
video 0 24 24
report 0 24 24
that 0 24 24
seems 0 24 24
to 0 24 24
have 0 24 24
provided 0 24 24
a 0 24 24
bit 0 24 24
of 0 24 24
evidence 0 24 24
to 0 24 24
the 0 24 24
claim 0 24 24
that 0 24 24
Islamists 0 24 24
were 0 24 24
crossing 0 24 24
our 0 24 24
southern 0 24 24
border. 0 24 24

And 0 24 25
even 0 24 25
though 0 24 25
Islamic 0 24 25
jihadis 0 24 25
have 0 24 25
been 0 24 25
apprehended 0 24 25
on 0 24 25
our 0 24 25
border 0 24 25
in 0 24 25
2014, 0 24 25
the 0 24 25
Homeland 0 24 25
Security 0 24 25
waved 0 24 25
their 0 24 25
hand 0 24 25
and 0 24 25
said, 0 24 25
"There's 1 24 25
no 1 24 25
threat." 1 24 25

In 0 24 26
fact, 0 24 26
DHS 0 24 26
had 0 24 26
denied 0 24 26
Muslim 0 24 26
terrorists 0 24 26
were 0 24 26
crossing 0 24 26
the 0 24 26
border, 0 24 26
but 0 24 26
a 0 24 26
local 0 24 26
investigator 0 24 26
produced 0 24 26
evidence 0 24 26
to 0 24 26
the 0 24 26
contrary. 0 24 26

Reports 0 24 27
indicated 0 24 27
that 0 24 27
some 0 24 27
jihadis 0 24 27
were 0 24 27
paying 0 24 27
as 0 24 27
much 0 24 27
as 0 24 27
$50,000 0 24 27
to 0 24 27
get 0 24 27
across 0 24 27
the 0 24 27
border. 0 24 27

This 0 24 28
has 0 24 28
been 0 24 28
documented 0 24 28
for 0 24 28
several 0 24 28
years 0 24 28
now. 0 24 28

It's 0 24 29
not 0 24 29
surprising. 0 24 29

What 1 24 30
is 1 24 30
surprising 1 24 30
is 1 24 30
the 1 24 30
level 1 24 30
of 1 24 30
secrecy 1 24 30
surrounding 1 24 30
the 1 24 30
Las 1 24 30

and 1 24 30
the 1 24 30
containment 1 24 30
of 1 24 30

more 1 24 30
than 1 24 30
three 1 24 30

This 0 27 20

is 0 27 20
noteworthy 0 27 20
as 0 27 20
the 0 27 20

As 0 27 21
recently 0 27 21
as 0 27 21
Friday, 0 27 21
Hall 0 27 21
refused 0 27 21
to 0 27 21
fire 0 27 21
Guyger, 0 27 21
saying 0 27 21
in 0 27 21
part, 0 27 21
“There 0 27 21
is 0 27 21
one 0 27 21
overriding 0 27 21
reason 0 27 21
that 0 27 21

have 0 27 21
not 0 27 21
taken 0 27 21
any 0 27 21
administrative 0 27 21

Also, 0 27 23
in 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
town 0 27 23
hall 0 27 23
meeting 0 27 23
last 0 27 23

Hall 0 27 23
again 0 27 23

her 0 27 23
choice 0 27 23
to 0 27 23
refuse 0 27 23
to 0 27 23
fire 0 27 23
Guyger, 0 27 23
claiming 0 27 23
it 0 27 23
would 0 27 23
be 0 27 23
against 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
law. 0 27 23

“I 0 27 24
can’t 0 27 24
do 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
because 0 27 24
there 0 27 24
are 0 27 24
both 0 27 24
local, 0 27 24
state 0 27 24
and 0 27 24
federal 0 27 24
laws 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
prohibit 0 27 24
me 0 27 24
from 0 27 24
taking 0 27 24
action. 0 27 24

There 0 27 25
are 0 27 25
civil 0 27 25
service 0 27 25
laws 0 27 25
we 0 27 25
have 0 27 25
to 0 27 25
adhere 0 27 25
to,” 0 27 25
said 0 27 25
Hall. 0 27 25

Apparently, 0 27 26
it 0 27 26
is 0 27 26
no 0 27 26
longer 0 27 26
against 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
law. 0 27 26

This 0 27 27
news 0 27 27
will 0 27 27
likely 0 27 27
be 0 27 27
well 0 27 27
received 0 27 27
by 0 27 27
the 0 27 27
Jean 0 27 27
family 0 27 27
as 0 27 27
well 0 27 27
as 0 27 27
the 0 27 27
activists 0 27 27
who 0 27 27
have 0 27 27
been 0 27 27
calling 0 27 27
for 0 27 27
justice 0 27 27
for 0 27 27
Botham 0 27 27
since 0 27 27
the 0 27 27
beginning. 0 27 27

As 0 27 28
TFTP 0 27 28
previously 0 27 28
reported, 0 27 28
the 0 27 28
idea 0 27 28
of 0 27 28
not 0 27 28
firing 0 27 28
Guyger 0 27 28
seemed 0 27 28
utterly 1 27 28
preposterous 1 27 28
as 0 27 28
she 0 27 28
admitted 0 27 28
to 0 27 28
doing 0 27 28
something 0 27 28
wrong. 0 27 28

While 0 27 29
controversy 0 27 29
swarms 0 27 29
the 0 27 29
case 0 27 29
of 0 27 29
why 0 27 29
she 0 27 29
may 0 27 29
have 0 27 29
killed 0 27 29
Jean, 0 27 29
there 0 27 29
is 0 27 29
no 0 27 29
doubt 0 27 29
that 0 27 29
she 0 27 29
did 0 27 29
kill 0 27 29
him. 0 27 29

This 0 27 30
is 0 27 30
a 0 27 30
fact. 0 27 30

This 0 27 31
public 0 27 31
servant 0 27 31
walked 0 27 31
into 0 27 31
an 0 27 31
innocent 1 27 31
man’s 0 27 31
home 0 27 31
and 0 27 31
shot 0 27 31
him 0 27 31
dead. 0 27 31

Because 0 27 32
of 0 27 32
her 0 27 32
actions, 0 27 32
this 0 27 32
man 0 27 32
no 0 27 32
longer 0 27 32
lives. 0 27 32

This 0 27 33
alone 0 27 33
should 0 27 33
have 0 27 33
been 0 27 33
enough 0 27 33
to 0 27 33
fire 0 27 33
her. 0 27 33

Surprisingly 0 27 34
enough, 0 27 34
NRA 0 27 34
spokesperson 0 27 34
Dana 0 27 34
Loesch 0 27 34
responded 0 27 34
to 0 27 34
the 0 27 34
firing 0 27 34
of 0 27 34
Guyger 0 27 34
with 0 27 34
one 0 27 34
word, 0 27 34
“Good,” 0 27 34
showing 0 27 34
her 0 27 34
support 0 27 34
for 0 27 34
the 0 27 34
move. 0 27 34

For 0 27 35
those 0 27 35
who 0 27 35
don’t 0 27 35
recall, 0 27 35
Loesch 0 27 35
sparked 0 27 35
controversy 0 27 35
earlier 0 27 35
this 0 27 35
month 0 27 35
by 0 27 35
claiming 0 27 35
that 0 27 35
if 0 27 35
Botham 0 27 35
Jean 0 27 35
were 0 27 35
a 0 27 35
gun 0 27 35
owner, 0 27 35
he 0 27 35
may 0 27 35
be 0 27 35
alive 0 27 35
today. 0 27 35

Indeed, 0 27 36
as 0 27 36
TFTP 0 27 36
reported 0 27 36
over 0 27 36
the 0 27 36
weekend, 0 27 36
a 0 27 36
father 0 27 36
in 0 27 36
Prince 0 27 36
George’s 0 27 36
County 0 27 36
opened 0 27 36
fire 0 27 36
on 0 27 36
officers 0 27 36
as 0 27 36
they 0 27 36
wrongly 0 27 36
entered 0 27 36
his 0 27 36
apartment. 0 27 36

He 0 27 37
shot 0 27 37
two 0 27 37
officers. 0 27 37

Not 0 27 38
only 0 27 38
was 0 27 38
he 0 27 38
not 0 27 38
arrested, 0 27 38
but 0 27 38
the 0 27 38
police 0 27 38
chief 0 27 38
praised 0 27 38
him 0 27 38

it's 1 30 5

that 0 30 11

off 0 34 17
our 0 34 17

The 0 34 18
president 0 34 18
also 0 34 18
pointed 0 34 18
out 0 34 18
that 0 34 18

"The 0 34 19
people 0 34 19
of 0 34 19
Indiana 0 34 19
do 0 34 19
not 0 34 19
have 0 34 19
a 0 34 19
one-week 0 34 19
memory,” 0 34 19
said 0 34 19
Trump. 0 34 19

“That 0 34 20
was 0 34 20
a 0 34 20
disgrace 0 34 20
what 0 34 20
we 0 34 20
watched 0 34 20
up 0 34 20
there." 0 34 20

Additionally, 0 34 21
Trump 0 34 21
said 0 34 21
that 0 34 21
Donnelly 0 34 21
voted 0 34 21
to 0 34 21
provide 0 34 21

While 0 34 22
some 0 34 22
don't 0 34 22
believe 0 34 22
that 0 34 22
Trump's 1 34 22
base 1 34 22
is 1 34 22
all 1 34 22
that 1 34 22
energized, 1 34 22
it 1 34 22
seems 1 34 22
pretty 1 34 22
energetic 1 34 22
to 1 34 22
me 1 34 22
and 0 34 22
attacks 0 34 22
on 0 34 22
conservatives 0 34 22
on 0 34 22

and 0 34 22
in 0 34 22
search 0 34 22
engine 0 34 22
results 0 34 22
have 1 34 22
only 1 34 22
furthered 1 34 22
their 1 34 22
outrage 1 34 22
at 1 34 22
the 1 34 22
establishment, 1 34 22
both 0 34 22
Democrat 0 34 22
and 0 34 22
Republican. 0 34 22

We're 0 34 23
just 0 34 23
days 0 34 23
away 0 34 23
from 0 34 23
seeing 0 34 23
how 0 34 23
things 0 34 23
turn 0 34 23
out. 0 34 23

There's 0 34 24
a 0 34 24
part 0 34 24
of 0 34 24
me 0 34 24
that 0 34 24
thinks 0 34 24
this 0 34 24
may 0 34 24
actually 0 34 24
turn 0 34 24
out 0 34 24
to 0 34 24
be 0 34 24
one 0 34 24
of 0 34 24
the 0 34 24
biggest 0 34 24
turnouts 0 34 24
for 0 34 24
a 0 34 24
mid-term 0 34 24
election 0 34 24
that 0 34 24
we've 0 34 24
ever 0 34 24
seen, 0 34 24
but 0 34 24
that's 1 34 24
just 1 34 24
my 1 34 24
gut 1 34 24
feeling. 1 34 24

On 0 34 25
Tuesday, 0 34 25
we'll 0 34 25
know 0 34 25
for 0 34 25
sure. 0 34 25

I 0 34 26
don't 0 34 26
know 0 34 26
about 0 34 26
you, 0 34 26
but 0 34 26
I 0 34 26
didn't 0 34 26
actually 0 34 26
like 0 34 26
hearing 0 34 26
the 0 34 26
words 0 34 26
"Speaker 0 34 26
Paul 0 34 26
Ryan." 0 34 26

I 0 34 27
certainly 0 34 27
don't 0 34 27
want 0 34 27
to 0 34 27
hear 0 34 27

the 0 35 4

hailed 0 35 4
as 0 35 4
being 0 35 4
responsible 0 35 4
for 0 35 4

the 0 35 4
shooter 0 35 4
from 0 35 4
continuing 0 35 4
his 0 35 4

Jesus 0 35 5
Campos 0 35 5
was 0 35 5
actually 0 35 5

constantly 1 35 6
changing 1 35 6

are 0 35 6

know 0 35 6
a 0 35 6
hotel 0 35 6
security 0 35 6

had 0 35 6
been 0 35 6
shot 0 35 6
“until 0 35 6
they 0 35 6
met 0 35 6

said. 0 35 6

The 0 35 7
security 0 35 7

was 0 35 7
struck 0 35 7

from 0 35 7

What 0 35 16
happened 0 35 16
during 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
6 0 35 16
minutes 0 35 16
between 0 35 16

being 0 35 16
shot 0 35 16
and 0 35 16

opening 0 35 16
fire, 0 35 16
and 0 35 16
why 1 35 16
weren’t 1 35 16
the 1 35 16
police 1 35 16
rushing 1 35 16
to 1 35 16
the 1 35 16
scene 1 35 16
immediately? 1 35 16

Why 0 35 17
did 0 35 17
shooter 0 35 17
Stephen 0 35 17
Paddock 0 35 17
stop 0 35 17
shooting? 0 35 17

Paddock 0 35 18
had 0 35 18
already 0 35 18
shot 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
security 0 35 18
guard, 0 35 18
waited 0 35 18
six 0 35 18
minutes 0 35 18
before 0 35 18
opening 0 35 18

on 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
concert 0 35 18

and 0 35 18
then 0 35 18
shot 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
a 0 35 18
full 0 35 18
ten 0 35 18
minutes. 0 35 18

Police 0 35 19
didn’t 0 35 19
arrive 0 35 19
for 0 35 19
two 0 35 19
additional 0 35 19
minutes 0 35 19
after 0 35 19
the 0 35 19
shooting 0 35 19
stopped 0 35 19
– 0 35 19
which 0 35 19
is 0 35 19
a 0 35 19
full 0 35 19
18 0 35 19
minutes 0 35 19
from 0 35 19
the 0 35 19
moment 0 35 19
Campos 0 35 19
was 0 35 19
initially 0 35 19
hit. 0 35 19

Moreover, 0 35 20
did 0 35 20
he 0 35 20
stop 0 35 20
shooting 0 35 20
because 0 35 20
he 0 35 20
was 0 35 20
planning 0 35 20
his 0 35 20
escape 0 35 20
from 0 35 20
the 0 35 20
32nd 0 35 20
floor? 0 35 20

Or 0 35 21
is 0 35 21
it 0 35 21
possible 0 35 21
that 0 35 21
Paddock 0 35 21
was 0 35 21
rushed 0 35 21
and 0 35 21
in 0 35 21
a 0 35 21

Khweis 0 38 3
is 0 38 3
an 0 38 3
interesting 0 38 3
case 0 38 3
for 0 38 3
numerous 0 38 3
reasons. 0 38 3

First, 0 38 4
there 0 38 4
was 0 38 4
no 0 38 4
particular 0 38 4
event 0 38 4
or 0 38 4
friend 0 38 4
who 0 38 4
ignited 0 38 4
his 0 38 4
radicalization. 0 38 4

Second, 0 38 5
he 0 38 5
successfully 0 38 5
made 0 38 5
it 0 38 5
to 0 38 5
Syria 0 38 5
via 0 38 5
Turkey. 0 38 5

And 0 38 6
third, 0 38 6
he 0 38 6
came 0 38 6
from 0 38 6
a 0 38 6
secular 0 38 6
home 0 38 6
that 0 38 6
was 0 38 6
stable. 0 38 6

His 0 38 7
life 0 38 7
before 0 38 7
joining 0 38 7
the 0 38 7
caliphate 0 38 7
was 0 38 7
unremarkable. 0 38 7

He 0 38 8
obtained 0 38 8
an 0 38 8
associate’s 0 38 8
degree 0 38 8
in 0 38 8
criminal 0 38 8
justice 0 38 8
and 0 38 8
worked 0 38 8
as 0 38 8
a 0 38 8
bus 0 38 8
driver 0 38 8
in 0 38 8
Alexandria, 0 38 8
Va. 0 38 8

He 0 38 9
also 0 38 9
abused 0 38 9
marijuana 0 38 9
over 0 38 9
the 0 38 9
past 0 38 9
few 0 38 9
years. 0 38 9

Khweis’ 0 38 10
defense 0 38 10
attorney 0 38 10
said 0 38 10
Friday 0 38 10
that 0 38 10
even 0 38 10
he 0 38 10
has 0 38 10
no 0 38 10
idea 0 38 10
what 0 38 10
caused 0 38 10
Khweis 0 38 10
to 0 38 10
join 0 38 10
ISIS. 0 38 10

“It’s 0 38 11

understand,” 0 38 11

attorney 0 38 11
John 0 38 11
Zwerling 0 38 11
said 0 38 11
Friday. 0 38 11

“We 0 38 12
don’t 0 38 12
really 0 38 12
know 0 38 12
what 0 38 12
caused 0 38 12
him 0 38 12
to 0 38 12
travel 0 38 12
to 0 38 12
Syria.” 0 38 12

From 0 38 13
the 0 38 13
very 0 38 13
start 0 38 13
of 0 38 13
his 0 38 13
trial, 0 38 13
Khweis 0 38 13
said 0 38 13
he 0 38 13
regretted 0 38 13
his 0 38 13
actions 0 38 13
and 0 38 13
said 0 38 13
his 0 38 13
decision 0 38 13
to 0 38 13
join 0 38 13
ISIS 0 38 13
in 0 38 13
December 0 38 13
2015 0 38 13
was 0 38 13
a 0 38 13
drunken 1 38 13
one. 1 38 13

“I 0 38 14
hated 0 38 14
myself 0 38 14
for 0 38 14
making 0 38 14
the 0 38 14
worst 0 38 14
decision 0 38 14
I 0 38 14
ever 0 38 14
made,” 0 38 14
Khweis 0 38 14
wrote 0 38 14
to 0 38 14
the 0 38 14
judge 0 38 14
in 0 38 14
a 0 38 14
letter. 0 38 14

“I 0 38 15
ruined 1 38 15
my 1 38 15
life 1 38 15
and 1 38 15
my 1 38 15
family’s 1 38 15
life.” 1 38 15

Prosecutors, 0 38 16
who 0 38 16
pushed 0 38 16
for 0 38 16
35 0 38 16
years 0 38 16
in 0 38 16
prison, 0 38 16
accused 0 38 16
Khweis 0 38 16
of 0 38 16
lying 0 38 16
repeatedly 0 38 16
over 0 38 16
the 0 38 16
last 0 38 16
15 0 38 16
months 0 38 16
of 0 38 16
the 0 38 16
trial. 0 38 16

When 0 38 17
Khweis 0 38 17
was 0 38 17
first 0 38 17
captured 0 38 17
in 0 38 17
Iraq 0 38 17
in 0 38 17
March 0 38 17
2016, 0 38 17
he 0 38 17
told 0 38 17
the 0 38 17
FBI 0 38 17
that 0 38 17
he 0 38 17
was 0 38 17
following 0 38 17
a 0 38 17
young 0 38 17
woman. 0 38 17

However, 0 38 18
that 0 38 18
young 0 38 18
woman 0 38 18
didn’t 0 38 18
exist. 0 38 18

“This 0 38 19

executed 1 38 19
his 1 38 19

In 0 40 39
fact, 0 40 39
the 0 40 39

The 0 40 40
lawsuit 0 40 40
also 0 40 40
argues 0 40 40
the 0 40 40

violates 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
Tenth 0 40 40

by 0 40 40
infringing 0 40 40
on 0 40 40
states' 0 40 40
rights 0 40 40
to 0 40 40

Washington 0 40 41
has 0 40 41
a 0 40 41
robust 0 40 41
regulatory 0 40 41
system 0 40 41
meant 0 40 41
to 0 40 41
keep 0 40 41

out 0 40 41
of 0 40 41
the 0 40 41
hands 0 40 41
of 0 40 41
dangerous 0 40 41
individuals. 0 40 41

That 0 40 42
system 0 40 42
is 0 40 42
jeopardized 0 40 42
by 0 40 42
the 0 40 42
Trump 0 40 42
Administration's 0 40 42
action 0 40 42
and 0 40 42
will 0 40 42
be 0 40 42
undermined 0 40 42

Note 0 40 43
that 0 40 43
Ferguson 0 40 43
forgets 0 40 43
that 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
Tenth 0 40 43
Amendment 0 40 43
states 0 40 43
plainly: 0 40 43

The 0 40 44
powers 0 40 44
not 0 40 44
delegated 0 40 44
to 0 40 44
the 0 40 44

by 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
Constitution, 0 40 44
nor 0 40 44
prohibited 0 40 44
by 0 40 44
it 0 40 44
to 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
States, 0 40 44
are 0 40 44
reserved 0 40 44
to 0 40 44
the 0 40 44

the 0 40 44

(emphasis 0 40 45
mine) 0 40 45

Since 0 40 46
our 0 40 46
founders 0 40 46
clearly 0 40 46
said 0 40 46
that 0 40 46

the 0 40 46
Second 0 40 46

that 0 40 46
the 0 40 46

this 0 40 46

has 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
right 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
do 0 40 46
just 0 40 46
that, 0 40 46
infringe 1 40 46
on 1 40 46
the 1 40 46

of 1 40 46
the 1 40 46
people 1 40 46
by 1 40 46
regulating 1 40 46
firearms. 1 40 46

he 0 40 47
is 0 40 47
reading 0 40 47
something 0 40 47
into 0 40 47
it 0 40 47
that 0 40 47
is 0 40 47
simply 0 40 47
not 0 40 47
there, 0 40 47
but 0 40 47
that's 0 40 47
a 0 40 47
Communist 1 40 47
ideology 0 40 47
you 0 40 47
are 0 40 47

As 0 40 51
reported 0 40 51
yesterday, 0 40 51
Defense 0 40 51
Distributed 0 40 51
is 0 40 51
already 0 40 51
embroiled 0 40 51
in 0 40 51
its 0 40 51
own 0 40 51
lawsuit 0 40 51
against 0 40 51
New 0 40 51
Jersey 0 40 51
and 0 40 51
Los 0 40 51
Angeles 0 40 51
over 0 40 51
those 0 40 51
authorities' 0 40 51
threats, 0 40 51
and 0 40 51
simultaneously 0 40 51
is 0 40 51
fighting 0 40 51
Pennsylvania's 0 40 51
request 0 40 51

a 0 40 51
temporary 0 40 51

them. 0 40 51

(Both 0 40 52
those 0 40 52
states 0 40 52
are 0 40 52
also 0 40 52
part 0 40 52
of 0 40 52
today's 0 40 52
federal 0 40 52

the 0 40 52

While 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
various 0 40 53
court 0 40 53
filings 0 40 53
about 0 40 53
this 0 40 53
continue 0 40 53
to 0 40 53
suggest 0 40 53
that 0 40 53
August 0 40 53
1 0 40 53
is 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
date 0 40 53
on 0 40 53
which 0 40 53
Defense 0 40 53
Distributed 0 40 53
will 0 40 53
begin 0 40 53
distributing 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
files—which, 0 40 53
again, 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
settlement 0 40 53
legally 0 40 53
permits 0 40 53
them 0 40 53
to 0 40 53
do—the 0 40 53
distribution 0 40 53
is 0 40 53
already 0 40 53
happening. 0 40 53

Cody 0 40 54
Wilson 0 40 54
of 0 40 54
Defense 0 40 54

fundraising 0 40 54
off 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
suit 0 40 54
via 0 40 54
Twitter. 0 40 54

He 0 40 55
told 0 40 55
me 0 40 55
five 0 40 55
years 0 40 55
ago, 0 40 55
when 0 40 55
I 0 40 55
was 0 40 55
writing 0 40 55
a 0 40 55
feature 0 40 55
story 0 40 55
on 0 40 55
the 0 40 55
beginnings 0 40 55
of 0 40 55
his 0 40 55
fight 0 40 55
with 0 40 55
the 0 40 55
government 0 40 55
over 0 40 55
gun-making 0 40 55
files, 0 40 55
that 0 40 55
"This 0 40 55
has 0 40 55
been 0 40 55
a 0 40 55
continuous 0 40 55
process 0 40 55
of 0 40 55
different 0 40 55
levels 0 40 55
of 0 40 55
authority 0 40 55
figures 0 40 55
trying 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
stop 0 40 55
it 0 40 55
from 0 40 55
happening 0 40 55
and 0 40 55
thus 0 40 55
allowing 0 40 55
it 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
happen...Of 0 40 55
course 0 40 55
we 0 40 55
are 0 40 55
going 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
succeed—because 0 40 55
you 0 40 55
all 0 40 55
are 0 40 55
trying 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
stop 0 40 55
me. 0 40 55

That 0 40 56
seemed 0 40 56
natural 0 40 56
and 0 40 56
ended 0 40 56
up 0 40 56
being 0 40 56
true." 0 40 56

So 0 40 57
far, 0 40 57
that 0 40 57
has 0 40 57
continued 0 40 57
to 0 40 57
be 0 40 57
true. 0 40 57

This 1 40 58
federal 1 40 58
judge 1 40 58
should 1 40 58
know 1 40 58
what 1 40 58
the 1 40 58
Constitution 1 40 58
actually 1 40 58
says 1 40 58
and 0 40 58
should 0 40 58
have 0 40 58
tossed 0 40 58
this 0 40 58
frivolous 1 40 58
lawsuit 0 40 58
in 0 40 58
the 0 40 58
trash 0 40 58
where 0 40 58
it 0 40 58
belongs. 0 40 58

Instead, 0 40 59
he 0 40 59
is 0 40 59
demonstrating 0 40 59
he 0 40 59
is 0 40 59
not 1 40 59
even 1 40 59
fit 1 40 59
to 1 40 59

they 0 40 59

not 1 40 59

Today 0 41 5

received 0 41 5
an 0 41 5
email 0 41 5
from 0 41 5
a 0 41 5
monastery 0 41 5
of 0 41 5

about 0 41 5

from 0 41 5
the 0 41 5
Vatican’s 0 41 5

They’re 0 41 6
helping 0 41 6
me 0 41 6
examine 0 41 6
this 0 41 6
document, 0 41 6
having 0 41 6

it 0 41 6

an 0 41 6
inside 0 41 6

These, 0 41 7
I 0 41 7
might 0 41 7
add, 0 41 7
are 0 41 7
not 0 41 7
what 0 41 7
we 0 41 7
would 0 41 7
consider 0 41 7

independence 0 41 12
of 0 41 12
each 0 41 12

destroys 0 41 12
the 0 41 12

laid 0 41 15
out 0 41 15
pretty 0 41 15
clearly 0 41 15
what 0 41 15
was 0 41 15
coming 0 41 15
in 0 41 15
this 0 41 15
piece 0 41 15
of 0 41 15
legislation, 0 41 15
3 0 41 15
years 0 41 15
later. 0 41 15

In 0 41 16
fact, 0 41 16

the 0 41 16
National 0 41 16
Catholic 0 41 16

the 0 41 16
meeting 0 41 16

“unprecedented,” 0 41 16
1200 0 41 16

hear 0 41 16
the 0 41 16
new 0 41 16
marching 0 41 16
orders. 0 41 16

This 0 41 17
is 0 41 17
the 0 41 17
programme: 0 41 17

“Do 0 41 18
not 0 41 18
distance 0 41 18
yourself 0 41 18
from 0 41 18
the 0 41 18
great 0 41 18
lines 0 41 18
of 0 41 18
the 0 41 18
Second 0 41 18
Vatican 0 41 18

“In 0 41 18
fact, 0 41 18
those 1 41 18
that 1 41 18
are 1 41 18
distancing 1 41 18
themselves 1 41 18
from 1 41 18

to 1 41 18
make 1 41 18
another 1 41 18
path 1 41 18
are 1 41 18
killing 1 41 18
themselves 1 41 18
– 0 41 18
sooner 1 41 18
or 1 41 18
later, 1 41 18
they 1 41 18
will 1 41 18
die. 1 41 18

They 0 41 19
will 0 41 19
not 0 41 19
have 0 41 19
sense. 0 41 19

They 1 41 20
will 1 41 20
be 1 41 20
outside 1 41 20

need 0 41 21
to 0 41 21
build, 0 41 21

the 0 41 21
Gospel 0 41 21

the 0 41 21

a 0 41 21
departure 0 41 21
point.” 0 41 21

After 0 41 22
breathing 0 41 22
this 0 41 22
threat, 0 41 22
the 0 41 22
cardinal 0 41 22
continued, 0 41 22
saying 0 41 22
that 0 41 22
because 0 41 22
modern 0 41 22
people’s 0 41 22
“needs” 0 41 22
are 0 41 22
fundamentally 0 41 22
different 0 41 22
from 0 41 22
what 0 41 22
they 0 41 22
were 0 41 22
in 0 41 22
the 0 41 22
past, 0 41 22
there 0 41 22
was 0 41 22
no 0 41 22
reason 0 41 22

the 0 41 26

reminds 0 41 26
us 0 41 26

It 0 41 36
is 0 41 36
to 0 41 36
wonder 0 41 36
what 0 41 36
this 0 41 36

would 0 41 36
make 0 41 36
of 0 41 36

the 0 41 36

Dom 0 41 36

“The 0 41 37

as 0 41 37

we 0 41 37
cannot 0 41 37
remain 0 41 37
neutral, 0 41 37

must 0 41 37

wholly 0 41 37
to 0 41 37
the 0 41 37
one 0 41 37
or 0 41 37
wholly 0 41 37
to 0 41 37
the 0 41 37

“After 0 41 38
entering 0 41 38
into 0 41 38
Christ 0 41 38
by 0 41 38
baptism 0 41 38
and 0 41 38
by 0 41 38
the 0 41 38
monastic 0 41 38
profession, 0 41 38
we 0 41 38
should 0 41 38
hold 0 41 38
ourselves 0 41 38
as 0 41 38
far 0 41 38

from 0 41 38

have 0 41 38
no 0 41 38

There 0 41 39
shall 0 41 39
no 0 41 39

than 0 41 39
there 0 41 39

between 0 41 39
two 0 41 39
corpses: 0 41 39
‘The 0 41 39

crucified 0 41 39

and 0 41 39
I 0 41 39
to 0 41 39

“Let 0 41 40
us 0 41 40
be 0 41 40
on 0 41 40
our 0 41 40

that 0 41 40
it 0 41 40
may 0 41 40
sometimes 0 41 40

the 0 41 40
distance 0 41 40
which 0 41 40

only 0 41 41

the 0 41 41
integrity 0 41 41

our 0 41 41
true 0 41 41

The 0 41 41
world 0 41 41
itself 0 41 41
is 0 41 41
scandalised 0 41 41
by 0 41 41
our 0 41 41
condescending 0 41 41
to 0 41 41

displeasing 0 41 41
to 0 41 41
them 0 41 41

Sister 0 41 43
T. 0 41 43
continued, 0 41 43
saying 0 41 43
that 0 41 43
the 0 41 43
document 0 41 43
explicitly 0 41 43
derogates 0 41 43
the 0 41 43
founding 0 41 43
intentions 0 41 43
of 0 41 43
St. 0 41 43
Teresa 0 41 43
for 0 41 43
whom 0 41 43
real 0 41 43
autonomy 0 41 43
was 0 41 43
a 0 41 43
crucial 0 41 43
element 0 41 43
of 0 41 43
her 0 41 43
Carmelite 0 41 43
reform. 0 41 43

She 0 41 44
acknowledges 0 41 44
that 0 41 44
cloistered 0 41 44
orders 0 41 44
of 0 41 44
nuns 0 41 44
have 0 41 44
for 0 41 44
some 0 41 44
time 0 41 44
been 0 41 44
gathered 0 41 44
into 0 41 44
federations. 0 41 44

These 0 41 45
are 0 41 45
already 0 41 45
doing 0 41 45
the 0 41 45
Cor 0 41 45
orans 0 41 45
programme, 0 41 45
having 0 41 45
shared 0 41 45
initial 0 41 45
formation 0 41 45
programmes 0 41 45
for 0 41 45
postulants 0 41 45
and 0 41 45
novices, 0 41 45
“ongoing 0 41 45
formation” 0 41 45
courses 0 41 45
for 0 41 45
professed 0 41 45
nuns, 0 41 45
a 0 41 45
federal 0 41 45
abbess 0 41 45
or 0 41 45
president 0 41 45
who 0 41 45
oversees 0 41 45
all 0 41 45
the 0 41 45
federated 0 41 45

Their 0 41 46
funds 0 41 46
are 0 41 46
already 0 41 46
interconnected 0 41 46
and 0 41 46
they 0 41 46
have 0 41 46
regular 0 41 46
meetings 0 41 46
with 0 41 46
and 0 41 46
input 0 41 46
from 0 41 46
the 0 41 46
male 0 41 46
branches. 0 41 46

In 0 41 47
2015, 0 41 47
Carmelite 0 41 47
monasteries 0 41 47
received 0 41 47
a 0 41 47
questionnaire 0 41 47
from 0 41 47
the 0 41 47
Father 0 41 47
General 0 41 47
Fr. 0 41 47

Saverio 0 41 48
Cannistra, 0 41 48
a 0 41 48
Mexican 0 41 48
and 0 41 48
devotee 0 41 48
of 0 41 48
Liberation 0 41 48
Theology, 0 41 48
to 0 41 48
ask 0 41 48
if 0 41 48
they 0 41 48
wanted 0 41 48
an 0 41 48
International 0 41 48
Commission 0 41 48
of 0 41 48
Nuns 0 41 48
to 0 41 48
oversee 0 41 48
the 0 41 48
female 0 41 48
houses 0 41 48
place 0 41 48
of 0 41 48
the 0 41 48
Carmelite 0 41 48
Fathers. 0 41 48

This 0 41 49
suggestion 0 41 49
was 0 41 49
rejected, 0 41 49
to 0 41 49
the 0 41 49
annoyance 0 41 49
of 0 41 49
Maccise. 0 41 49

Maccise 0 41 50
also 0 41 50
promoted 0 41 50
the 0 41 50
idea 0 41 50
of 0 41 50
having 0 41 50
no 0 41 50
superiors 0 41 50
in 0 41 50
the 0 41 50
individual 0 41 50
monasteries, 0 41 50

and 0 41 50
shared 0 41 50
formation 0 41 50
of 0 41 50
novices. 0 41 50

The 0 41 51
push 0 41 51
for 0 41 51
these 0 41 51
changes 0 41 51
is 0 41 51
still 0 41 51
on, 0 41 51
however, 0 41 51
under 0 41 51
the 0 41 51
current 0 41 51
General, 0 41 51
an 0 41 51

Given 0 41 52
the 0 41 52
Marxist 0 41 52
leanings 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
the 0 41 52
recent 0 41 52
crop 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
Fathers 0 41 52
General, 0 41 52
it 0 41 52
seems 0 41 52
clear 0 41 52
that 0 41 52
what 0 41 52
can 0 41 52
be 0 41 52
expected 0 41 52
by 0 41 52
“ongoing 0 41 52
formation” 0 41 52
is, 0 41 52
in 0 41 52
essence, 0 41 52
some 0 41 52
form 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
political 0 41 52
indoctrination, 0 41 52
sprayed 0 41 52
over 0 41 52
with 0 41 52
a 0 41 52
micro-thin 0 41 52
layer 0 41 52
of 0 41 52
pious 0 41 52
language. 0 41 52

But 0 41 53
for 0 41 53
Carmelite 0 41 53
nuns, 0 41 53
Sister 0 41 53
said, 0 41 53
these 0 41 53
ideas 0 41 53
are 0 41 53
the 0 41 53
antithesis 0 41 53
of 0 41 53
the 0 41 53
intentions 0 41 53
of 0 41 53
St. 0 41 53
Teresa. 0 41 53

Authentic 0 41 54
autonomy, 0 41 54
independence 0 41 54
of 0 41 54
formation 0 41 54
and 0 41 54
finances, 0 41 54
“are 0 41 54
essential 0 41 54
points 0 41 54

that 0 41 54
Our 0 41 54

been 0 41 57
fighting 0 41 57
against 0 41 57

“To 0 41 58

She 0 41 61
points 0 41 61
to 0 41 61
the 0 41 61

“As 0 41 62

Our 0 41 63

a 0 41 63

requirement 0 41 65
will 0 41 65
be 0 41 65
for 0 41 65

In 0 41 86
the 0 41 86
last 0 41 86
20 0 41 86
years, 0 41 86
“conservative” 0 41 86

in 0 41 86
the 0 41 86

of 0 41 86
some 0 41 86
groups 0 41 86
of 0 41 86

of 0 41 86
the 0 41 86

They 0 41 87
point 0 41 87
to 0 41 87
the 0 41 87
Nashville 0 41 87

But 0 41 88
it 0 41 88
is 0 41 88
these 0 41 88
signs 0 41 88
of 0 41 88
refusal 0 41 88
of 0 41 88

In 0 41 90
the 0 41 90
continuing 0 41 90
analysis 0 41 90
that 0 41 90
will 0 41 90
follow 0 41 90
this 0 41 90
article, 0 41 90
we 0 41 90
can 0 41 90
see 0 41 90
that 0 41 90
the 0 41 90
purpose 0 41 90
of 0 41 90
this 0 41 90
document 0 41 90
is 0 41 90
to 0 41 90
fulfill 0 41 90
the 0 41 90
totalitarian 0 41 90
fantasies 0 41 90
of 0 41 90
the 0 41 90
anti-Catholic 0 41 90
revolutionaries, 0 41 90
now 0 41 90
nearing 0 41 90
the 0 41 90
end 0 41 90
of 0 41 90
their 0 41 90
lives 0 41 90
50 0 41 90
years 0 41 90
after 0 41 90
their 0 41 90
initial 0 41 90
near-triumph. 0 41 90

Its 0 41 91
intention 0 41 91
is 0 41 91
mopping 0 41 91
up; 0 41 91
either 0 41 91
to 0 41 91
herd 0 41 91
the 0 41 91
remaining 0 41 91
recalcitrants 0 41 91
– 0 41 91
those 0 41 91
who 0 41 91
have 0 41 91
resisted 0 41 91
even 0 41 91
to 0 41 91
the 0 41 91
softened 0 41 91
and 0 41 91
conciliating 0 41 91
degrees 0 41 91
typical 0 41 91
of 0 41 91
“conservatives” 0 41 91
– 0 41 91
into 0 41 91
the 0 41 91
full 0 41 91
post-conciliar 0 41 91
“reform” 0 41 91
instituted 0 41 91
by 0 41 91
the 0 41 91
revolutionaries 0 41 91
in 0 41 91
the 0 41 91
1960s 0 41 91
– 0 41 91
or 0 41 91
to 0 41 91
close 0 41 91
them. 0 41 91

The 0 41 92
thing 0 41 92
is, 0 41 92
the 0 41 92
result 0 41 92
will 0 41 92
obviously 0 41 92
be 0 41 92
the 0 41 92
same 0 41 92
either 0 41 92
way. 0 41 92

The 0 41 93
whole 0 41 93

what 0 41 93
happens 0 41 93

The 0 42 12
most 0 42 12
recent 0 42 12
outbreak 0 42 12
was 0 42 12
in 0 42 12

Without 0 42 16

“Some 0 43 31
people 0 43 31
have 0 43 31
shown 0 43 31
up 0 43 31
with 0 43 31
a 0 43 31
new 0 43 31
fashion. 0 43 31

We 0 43 32
used 0 43 32
to 0 43 32
think 0 43 32
that 0 43 32
fashion 1 43 32
has 0 43 32
to 0 43 32
do 0 43 32
with 0 43 32
haircuts, 0 43 32
clothes, 0 43 32
or 0 43 32
lifestyle, 0 43 32
but 0 43 32
the 1 43 32
vogue 1 43 32
today 1 43 32
is 1 43 32
to 0 43 32
sympathize 0 43 32
with 0 43 32
the 0 43 32
Jews 0 43 32
and 0 43 32
to 1 43 32
shed 1 43 32
crocodile 1 43 32
tears 1 43 32
about 1 43 32
their 1 43 32
sorrows, 1 43 32
their 1 43 32
heresy, 1 43 32
and 1 43 32
their 1 43 32
historical 1 43 32
lies. 1 43 32

This 0 43 33
is, 0 43 33
indeed, 0 43 33
a 0 43 33
new 0 43 33
fashion. 1 43 33

Some 0 43 34
esteemed 0 43 34
people 0 43 34
shed 0 43 34
tears 0 43 34
about 0 43 34
what 1 43 34
the 1 43 34
Jews 1 43 34
call 1 43 34
‘the 1 43 34
Holocaust.’ 1 43 34
[…] 0 43 34
“Did 0 43 34
the 0 43 34
Nazi 0 43 34
annihilation 1 43 34
– 0 43 34
the 0 43 34
Holocaust 0 43 34
– 0 43 34
target 0 43 34
only 0 43 34
the 0 43 34
Jews? 0 43 34

Anybody? 0 43 35

The 1 43 36
Jews 1 43 36
claim 1 43 36
that 1 43 36
it 1 43 36
happened 1 43 36
to 1 43 36
them 1 43 36
alone 1 43 36
and 1 43 36
that 1 43 36
the 1 43 36
number 1 43 36
of 1 43 36
Jews 1 43 36
who 1 43 36
died 1 43 36
in 1 43 36
that 1 43 36
Holocaust 1 43 36
was 1 43 36
six 1 43 36
million. 1 43 36

What 1 43 37
we 1 43 37
have 1 43 37
here 1 43 37
are 1 43 37
historical 1 43 37
errors. 1 43 37

First 0 43 38
of 0 43 38
all, 0 43 38
the 0 43 38
figure 0 43 38
of 0 43 38
six 0 43 38
million 0 43 38
is 0 43 38
a 0 43 38
historical 1 43 38
lie. 1 43 38

In 0 43 39
addition, 0 43 39
claiming 1 43 39
that 1 43 39
it 1 43 39
happened 1 43 39
to 1 43 39
the 1 43 39
Jews 1 43 39
alone 1 43 39
excludes 1 43 39
the 1 43 39
non-Jews 1 43 39
who 1 43 39
were 1 43 39
tortured 1 43 39
by 1 43 39
Hitler. 1 43 39

So 0 43 40
was 0 43 40
it 0 43 40
annihilation? 1 43 40

Yes, 0 43 41
it 0 43 41
was. 0 43 41

Who 0 43 42
did 0 43 42
Hitler 0 43 42
annihilate? 1 43 42

He 0 43 43
annihilated 1 43 43
a 0 43 43
group 0 43 43
of 0 43 43
races 0 43 43
and 0 43 43
people, 0 43 43
some 0 43 43
of 0 43 43
whom 0 43 43
were 0 43 43
even 0 43 43
German. 0 43 43

Hitler 0 43 44
annihilated 1 43 44
400,000 0 43 44
Germans 0 43 44
who 0 43 44
were 0 43 44
handicapped 0 43 44
or 0 43 44
suffered 0 43 44
from 0 43 44
chronic 0 43 44
diseases. 0 43 44

Hitler 0 43 45
did 0 43 45
not 0 43 45
annihilate 1 43 45
the 0 43 45
Jews 0 43 45
only. 0 43 45

[…] 0 43 46
“Hitler 1 43 46
was 1 43 46
not 1 43 46
the 1 43 46
first 1 43 46
in 1 43 46
the 1 43 46
West 1 43 46
to 1 43 46
perpetrate 1 43 46
a 1 43 46
genocide. 1 43 46

Inhuman 1 43 47
and 1 43 47
criminal 1 43 47
annihilation 1 43 47
runs 1 43 47
in 1 43 47
the 1 43 47
veins 1 43 47
of 1 43 47
many 1 43 47
in 1 43 47
the 1 43 47
West. 1 43 47

Hitler 0 43 48
embodies 0 43 48
one 0 43 48
type 0 43 48
of 0 43 48
modern 1 43 48
Western 1 43 48
annihilation. 1 43 48

When 1 43 49
the 1 43 49
Americans 1 43 49
occupied 1 43 49
the 1 43 49
republics 1 43 49
of 1 43 49
the 1 43 49
Indians, 1 43 49
they 1 43 49
annihilated 1 43 49
millions 1 43 49
of 1 43 49
human 1 43 49
beings. 1 43 49

It 1 43 50
is 1 43 50
said 1 43 50
that 1 43 50
they 1 43 50
annihilated 1 43 50
50-100 1 43 50
hundred 1 43 50
million, 1 43 50
but 1 43 50
nobody 1 43 50
ever 1 43 50
mentions 1 43 50
this. 1 43 50

[…] 0 43 51
“Was 0 43 51
there 0 43 51
annihilation? 1 43 51

Yes. 0 43 52

Many 0 43 53
races 0 43 53
were 0 43 53
annihilated. 1 43 53

The 0 43 54
Auschwitz 0 43 54
camp, 0 43 54
which 0 43 54
is 0 43 54
in 0 43 54
southern 0 43 54
Poland, 0 43 54
was 0 43 54
a 0 43 54
major 0 43 54
and 0 43 54
exceptional 1 43 54
camp 0 43 54
for 0 43 54
detention, 0 43 54
torture, 0 43 54
and 0 43 54
forced 0 43 54
labor. 0 43 54

Many 0 43 55
people 0 43 55
were 0 43 55
tortured 0 43 55
and 0 43 55
were 0 43 55
starved 0 43 55
to 0 43 55
death 0 43 55
there. 0 43 55

[…] 0 43 56
“The 0 43 56
Jews 0 43 56
were 0 43 56
banished, 1 43 56
tortured, 1 43 56
and 1 43 56
annihilated 1 43 56
because 0 43 56
of 0 43 56
their 0 43 56
deeds. 0 43 56

They 0 43 57
were 0 43 57
not 0 43 57
banished 0 43 57
for 0 43 57
being 0 43 57
Jews. 0 43 57

There 0 43 58
were 0 43 58
Jews 0 43 58
in 0 43 58

Islamic 0 43 58
countries 0 43 58
and 0 43 58
caliphates 0 43 58
as 0 43 58
well, 0 43 58
but 0 43 58
we 0 43 58
never 0 43 58
killed 0 43 58
them 0 43 58
just 0 43 58
for 0 43 58
being 0 43 58
Jews. 0 43 58

No, 1 43 59
it 1 43 59
never 1 43 59
happened. 1 43 59

Hitler 0 43 60
and 0 43 60
the 0 43 60
Nazi 0 43 60
state 0 43 60
knew 0 43 60
the 0 43 60
truth 0 43 60
about 0 43 60
the 0 43 60
Jews, 0 43 60
and 0 43 60
therefore, 0 43 60
they 0 43 60
began 0 43 60
tormenting 1 43 60
and 1 43 60
persecuting 1 43 60
them. 1 43 60

[…] 0 43 61
“That 0 43 61
is 0 43 61
when 0 43 61
the 0 43 61
Final 0 43 61

The 0 43 62
Nazis 0 43 62
called 0 43 62
it 0 43 62
the 0 43 62
‘Final 0 43 62

When 0 43 63
we 0 43 63
say 0 43 63
‘Final 1 43 63
Solution,’ 1 43 63
we 0 43 63
realize 0 43 63
that 0 43 63
many 1 43 63
of 1 43 63
the 1 43 63

by 1 43 63
the 1 43 63

Nazi 1 43 63
terms, 1 43 63
ideas, 1 43 63
and 1 43 63
notions. 1 43 63

It 1 43 64
is 1 43 64
as 1 43 64
if 1 43 64
they 1 43 64
are 1 43 64
two 1 43 64
faces 1 43 64
of 1 43 64
the 1 43 64
same 1 43 64
coin. 1 43 64

[…] 0 43 65
“Since 1 43 65
Germany 1 43 65
and 1 43 65
Europe 1 43 65
did 1 43 65
not 1 43 65
want 1 43 65
the 1 43 65
Jews, 1 43 65
the 1 43 65
Nazis 1 43 65
came 1 43 65
up 1 43 65
with 1 43 65
the 1 43 65
idea 1 43 65
of 1 43 65

the 1 43 65
Jews 1 43 65
to 1 43 65
another 1 43 65

after 0 43 67
a 0 43 67
while, 0 43 67
the 0 43 67
Nazis 0 43 67
discovered 0 43 67

there 0 43 67
were 0 43 67

the 1 45 6
judge 1 45 6
and 1 45 6
Republicans, 1 45 6
one 1 45 6
engineered 1 45 6
by 1 45 6
the 1 45 6
Democrats. 1 45 6

Senator 0 45 7
Dianne 0 45 7
Feinstein 0 45 7
sat 0 45 7
for 0 45 7
months 0 45 7
on 0 45 7
Ford’s 0 45 7
letter 0 45 7
and 0 45 7
then––just 0 45 7
as 0 45 7
the 1 45 7
Dems 1 45 7
did 0 45 7
in 0 45 7
1991with 0 45 7
Anita 0 45 7
Hill’s 0 45 7
charges 0 45 7
of 0 45 7
sexual 0 45 7
harassment 0 45 7
against 0 45 7
Clarence 0 45 7
Thomas’s 0 45 7
during 0 45 7
his 0 45 7
hearings––released 0 45 7
it 0 45 7
only 0 45 7
when 0 45 7
Kavanaugh 0 45 7
appeared 0 45 7
to 0 45 7
be 0 45 7
heading 0 45 7
for 0 45 7
confirmation. 0 45 7

Feinstein 0 45 8
still 0 45 8
hasn’t 0 45 8
given 0 45 8
the 0 45 8
Judiciary 0 45 8
Committee 0 45 8
an 0 45 8
unredacted 0 45 8
copy 0 45 8
of 0 45 8
the 0 45 8
letter. 0 45 8

A 0 45 9
few 0 45 9
weeks 0 45 9
after 0 45 9
Ford 0 45 9
went 0 45 9
public, 0 45 9
and 0 45 9
after 0 45 9
Kavanaugh 0 45 9
said 0 45 9
he 0 45 9
had 0 45 9
dairies 0 45 9
from 0 45 9
that 0 45 9
summer 0 45 9
detailing 0 45 9
his 0 45 9
whereabouts, 0 45 9
The 0 45 9
New 0 45 9
Yorker 0 45 9
published 0 45 9
Ramirez’s 0 45 9
account 0 45 9
of 0 45 9
a 0 45 9
drunken 0 45 9
party 0 45 9
filled 0 45 9
with 0 45 9
obscene 0 45 9
drinking 0 45 9
games 0 45 9
where 0 45 9
he 0 45 9
exposed 0 45 9
himself 0 45 9
to 0 45 9
Ramirez. 0 45 9

Given 0 45 10
that 0 45 10
the 0 45 10
Democrats 0 45 10
had 0 45 10
made 0 45 10
public 0 45 10
in 0 45 10
advance 0 45 10
their 0 45 10
intention 0 45 10
to 0 45 10
derail 0 45 10
the 0 45 10
hearings 0 45 10
and 0 45 10
confirmation 0 45 10
by 0 45 10
any 0 45 10
means 0 45 10
possible, 0 45 10
the 0 45 10
timing 0 45 10
of 0 45 10
both 0 45 10
sexual 0 45 10
assault 0 45 10
charges 0 45 10
reeks 1 45 10
of 1 45 10
premeditated 0 45 10
contrivance 0 45 10
intended 0 45 10
to 0 45 10
delay 0 45 10
confirmation 0 45 10
as 0 45 10
long 0 45 10
as 0 45 10
possible. 0 45 10

But 0 45 11
in 0 45 11
the 0 45 11
face 0 45 11
of 0 45 11
this 0 45 11
naked 1 45 11
ploy 1 45 11
to 0 45 11
bork 0 45 11
Kavanaugh 0 45 11
and 0 45 11
derail 0 45 11
the 0 45 11
confirmation 0 45 11
process 0 45 11
for 0 45 11
partisan 0 45 11
advantage, 0 45 11
the 0 45 11
Republicans 0 45 11
seem 0 45 11
to 0 45 11
be 0 45 11
reverting 0 45 11
to 0 45 11
their 0 45 11
customary 1 45 11
preemptive 1 45 11
cringe. 1 45 11

All 0 45 12
the 1 45 12
Dems 1 45 12
have 0 45 12
to 0 45 12
do 0 45 12
is 1 45 12
squeal 1 45 12
“sexism” 0 45 12
and 0 45 12
Republicans 0 45 12
start 0 45 12
negotiating 0 45 12
and 0 45 12
offering 0 45 12
concessions. 0 45 12

Of 0 45 13
course, 0 45 13
after 0 45 13
each 0 45 13
concession 0 45 13
comes 0 45 13
another 0 45 13
demand. 0 45 13

First 0 45 14
the 1 45 14
Dems 1 45 14
demanded 0 45 14
that 0 45 14
Ford, 0 45 14
a 0 45 14
long-time 0 45 14
Democrat 0 45 14
activist, 0 45 14
“be 0 45 14
heard.” 0 45 14
So 0 45 14
last 0 45 14
week 0 45 14
the 0 45 14
Chairman 0 45 14
of 0 45 14
Judiciary 0 45 14
Committee, 0 45 14
Chuck 0 45 14
Grassley, 0 45 14
granted 0 45 14
another 0 45 14
deadline 0 45 14
extension 0 45 14
for 0 45 14
Ford 0 45 14
to 0 45 14
decide 0 45 14
whether 0 45 14
to 0 45 14
testify 0 45 14
before 0 45 14
the 0 45 14
Committee 0 45 14
on 0 45 14
Monday. 0 45 14

Senator 0 45 15
Dianne 0 45 15
Feinstein 0 45 15
calls 0 45 15
these 0 45 15
concessions 0 45 15
“bullying 1 45 15
deadlines.” 1 45 15
As 0 45 15
Feinstein 0 45 15
put 0 45 15
it, 0 45 15
“Show 0 45 15
some 0 45 15
heart. 0 45 15

Wait 0 45 16
until 0 45 16
Dr. 0 45 16
Ford 0 45 16
feels 0 45 16
that 0 45 16
she 0 45 16
can 0 45 16
come 0 45 16
before 0 45 16
the 0 45 16
committee.” 0 45 16
Ford 0 45 16
doesn’t 0 45 16
“feel” 0 45 16
like 0 45 16
she 0 45 16
can 0 45 16
testify 0 45 16
on 0 45 16
Monday 0 45 16
because 0 45 16
she’s 0 45 16
afraid 0 45 16
of 0 45 16
flying, 0 45 16
despite 0 45 16
offers 0 45 16
from 0 45 16
the 0 45 16
Committee 0 45 16
to 0 45 16
travel 0 45 16
to 0 45 16
her 0 45 16
in 0 45 16
California. 0 45 16

Then 0 45 17
she 0 45 17
feared 0 45 17
for 0 45 17
her 0 45 17
life 0 45 17
because 0 45 17
of 0 45 17
death 0 45 17
threats 0 45 17
––threats 0 45 17
also 0 45 17
made 0 45 17
to 0 45 17
Kavanaugh, 0 45 17
his 0 45 17
wife 0 45 17
and 0 45 17
two 0 45 17
young 0 45 17
daughters–– 0 45 17
so 0 45 17
she 0 45 17
now 0 45 17
demands 0 45 17
enhanced 0 45 17
security 0 45 17
measures. 0 45 17

The 0 45 18
Committee 0 45 18
caved 0 45 18
and 0 45 18
moved 0 45 18
the 0 45 18
date 0 45 18
to 0 45 18
Thursday. 0 45 18

So 0 45 19
of 0 45 19
course, 0 45 19
Grassley 0 45 19
having 0 45 19
been 0 45 19
intimidated 0 45 19
into 0 45 19
giving 0 45 19
Ford 0 45 19
a 0 45 19
chance 0 45 19
to 0 45 19
address 0 45 19
the 0 45 19
Committee, 0 45 19
Ramirez 0 45 19
and 0 45 19
her 0 45 19
handlers 0 45 19
are 0 45 19
now 0 45 19
demanding 0 45 19
the 0 45 19
same 0 45 19
privilege. 0 45 19

“Creepy 1 45 20
Lawyer” 1 45 20
for 0 45 20
porn 0 45 20
star 0 45 20
Stormy 0 45 20
Daniels 0 45 20
claims 0 45 20
to 0 45 20
represent 0 45 20
a 0 45 20
woman 0 45 20
who 0 45 20
also 0 45 20
should 0 45 20
be 0 45 20
allowed 0 45 20
to 0 45 20
testify 0 45 20
to 0 45 20
the 0 45 20
Senate 0 45 20
Committee 0 45 20
about 0 45 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 45 20
partying 0 45 20
habits 0 45 20
while 0 45 20
at 0 45 20
Yale. 0 45 20

We’ll 0 45 21
have 0 45 21
to 0 45 21
see 0 45 21
whether 0 45 21
Grassley 0 45 21
can 0 45 21
find 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
stomach 1 45 21
to 1 45 21
put 1 45 21
an 1 45 21
end 1 45 21
to 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
farce 1 45 21
of 0 45 21
allowing 0 45 21
unsubstantiated 0 45 21
charges 0 45 21
from 0 45 21
Democrat 0 45 21
activists 0 45 21
to 0 45 21
waste 0 45 21
the 0 45 21
Committee’s 0 45 21
time. 0 45 21

Ford 0 45 22
and 0 45 22
Dianne 0 45 22
Feinstein 0 45 22
also 0 45 22
keep 0 45 22
demanding 0 45 22
an 0 45 22
FBI 0 45 22
investigation, 0 45 22
even 0 45 22
though 0 45 22
no 0 45 22
federal 0 45 22
crime 0 45 22
is 0 45 22
being 0 45 22
alleged, 0 45 22
and 0 45 22
any 0 45 22
investigation 0 45 22
36 0 45 22
years 0 45 22
after 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
offense 0 45 22
is 0 45 22
impossible. 0 45 22

Ford 0 45 23
can’t 0 45 23
remember 0 45 23
where 0 45 23
and 0 45 23
when 0 45 23
the 0 45 23
alleged 0 45 23
assault 0 45 23
took 0 45 23
place, 0 45 23
nor 0 45 23
how 0 45 23
she 0 45 23
got 0 45 23
to 0 45 23
or 0 45 23
went 0 45 23
home 0 45 23
from 0 45 23
the 0 45 23
party 0 45 23
where 0 45 23
it 0 45 23
allegedly 0 45 23
occurred. 0 45 23

Her 1 45 24
own 1 45 24
details 1 45 24
of 1 45 24
the 1 45 24
event 1 45 24
don’t 1 45 24
jibe 1 45 24
(Four 1 45 24
boys 1 45 24
or 1 45 24
three? 1 45 24

One 1 45 25
girl 1 45 25
or 1 45 25
two?). 1 45 25

She 0 45 26
told 0 45 26
no 0 45 26
one 0 45 26
about 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
assault 0 45 26
until 0 45 26
30 0 45 26
years 0 45 26
later. 0 45 26

A 0 45 27
“lifelong 0 45 27
friend” 0 45 27
whom 0 45 27
Ford 0 45 27
claims 0 45 27
was 0 45 27
at 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
party 0 45 27
has 0 45 27
denied 0 45 27
any 0 45 27
knowledge 0 45 27
of 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
it, 0 45 27
and 0 45 27
says 0 45 27
she’s 0 45 27
never 0 45 27
met 0 45 27
Kavanaugh. 0 45 27

Another 0 45 28
friend 0 45 28
who 0 45 28
reported 0 45 28
that 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
school 0 45 28
was 0 45 28
abuzz 0 45 28
with 0 45 28
gossip 0 45 28
about 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
attack 0 45 28
(which 0 45 28
apparently 0 45 28
took 0 45 28
place 0 45 28
during 0 45 28
summer 0 45 28
break), 0 45 28
retracted 0 45 28
her 0 45 28
statement. 0 45 28

The 0 45 29
two 0 45 29
men 0 45 29
Ford 0 45 29
named 0 45 29
as 0 45 29
possible 0 45 29
witnesses 0 45 29
to 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
assault 0 45 29
have 0 45 29
contradicter 0 45 29
her 0 45 29
claims 0 45 29
under 0 45 29
oath. 0 45 29

And 0 45 30
the 0 45 30
accused 0 45 30
Judge 0 45 30
Kavanaugh 0 45 30
also 0 45 30
under 0 45 30
oath 0 45 30
vehemently 1 45 30
denies 1 45 30
the 0 45 30
charges. 0 45 30

Given 0 45 31
that 0 45 31
36 0 45 31
years 0 45 31
have 0 45 31
passed 0 45 31
since 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
incident, 0 45 31
and 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
accuser’s 0 45 31
memory 0 45 31
is 0 45 31
so 0 45 31
hazy 0 45 31
and 0 45 31
short 0 45 31
on 0 45 31
coherent 0 45 31
details, 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
FBI 0 45 31
has 0 45 31
nothing 0 45 31
to 0 45 31
investigate. 0 45 31

Ramirez’s 0 45 32
charge 0 45 32
is 0 45 32
even 0 45 32
flimsier. 0 45 32

Here’s 0 45 33
a 0 45 33
catalogue 0 45 33
from 0 45 33
the 0 45 33
Daily 0 45 33
Wire: 0 45 33

1. 0 45 34

The 0 45 35
New 0 45 35
Yorker 0 45 35
could 0 45 35
not 0 45 35
find 0 45 35
a 0 45 35
single 0 45 35
witness 0 45 35
who 0 45 35
could 0 45 35
put 0 45 35
Kavanaugh 0 45 35
at 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
alleged 0 45 35
party. 0 45 35

2. 0 45 36

The 0 45 37
New 0 45 37

not 0 45 37
find 0 45 37
a 0 45 37
single 0 45 37
person 0 45 37
who 0 45 37
could 0 45 37
corroborate 0 45 37
Ramirez’s 0 45 37
claims. 0 45 37

3. 0 45 38

The 0 45 39
man 0 45 39
accused 0 45 39
of 0 45 39
egging 0 45 39
on 0 45 39
Kavanaugh 0 45 39
denied 0 45 39
Ramirez's 0 45 39
allegations 0 45 39
and 0 45 39
vouched 0 45 39
for 0 45 39
Kavanaugh’s 0 45 39
character. 0 45 39

4. 0 45 40

A 0 45 41
third 0 45 41
person 0 45 41
that 0 45 41
Ramirez 0 45 41
claimed 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
at 0 45 41
the 0 45 41
party 0 45 41
says 0 45 41
she 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
not 0 45 41
there 0 45 41
for 0 45 41
the 0 45 41
alleged 0 45 41
incident. 0 45 41

5. 0 45 42

Ramirez 0 45 43
contacted 0 45 43
her 0 45 43
former 0 45 43
classmates, 0 45 43
asking 0 45 43
about 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
incident, 0 45 43
and 0 45 43
admitted 0 45 43
she 0 45 43
was 0 45 43
not 0 45 43
sure 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
Kavanaugh 0 45 43
was 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
male 0 45 43
who 0 45 43
exposed 0 45 43
himself. 0 45 43

6. 0 45 44

A 0 45 45
woman 0 45 45
who 0 45 45
claims 0 45 45
she 0 45 45
was 0 45 45
“best 0 45 45
friends” 0 45 45
with 0 45 45
Ramirez 0 45 45
says 0 45 45
Ramirez 0 45 45
never 0 45 45
mentioned 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
story 0 45 45
and 0 45 45
initially 0 45 45
said 0 45 45
her 0 45 45
friend's 0 45 45
accusations 0 45 45
against 0 45 45
Kavanaugh 0 45 45
might 0 45 45
be 0 45 45
“politically 0 45 45
motivated.” 0 45 45

7. 0 45 46

Ramirez, 0 45 47
just 0 45 47
like 0 45 47
Christine 0 45 47
Blasey 0 45 47
Ford, 0 45 47
is 0 45 47
a 0 45 47
registered 0 45 47
Democrat 0 45 47
and 0 45 47
is 0 45 47
dedicated 0 45 47
to 0 45 47
leftist 0 45 47
causes. 0 45 47

8. 0 45 48

Ramirez 0 45 49
wasn’t 0 45 49
even 0 45 49
sure 0 45 49
her 0 45 49
memory 0 45 49
was 0 45 49
correct 0 45 49
— 0 45 49
until 0 45 49
she 0 45 49
spent 0 45 49
six 0 45 49
days 0 45 49
going 0 45 49
over 0 45 49
it 0 45 49
with 0 45 49
her 1 45 49
Democrat 1 45 49
lawyer. 1 45 49

9. 0 45 50

Ramirez 0 45 51
admits 0 45 51
there 0 45 51
are 0 45 51
holes 0 45 51
in 0 45 51
her 0 45 51
memory 0 45 51
due 0 45 51
to 0 45 51
how 0 45 51
much 0 45 51
she 0 45 51
drank 0 45 51
at 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
party. 0 45 51

10. 0 45 52

People 0 45 53
who 0 45 53
knew 0 45 53
Ramirez 0 45 53
after 0 45 53
her 0 45 53
time 0 45 53
at 0 45 53
Yale 0 45 53
say 0 45 53
that 0 45 53
she 0 45 53
never 0 45 53
once 0 45 53
mentioned 0 45 53
the 0 45 53
incident 0 45 53
— 0 45 53
until 0 45 53
Kavanaugh's 0 45 53
nomination 0 45 53
was 0 45 53
pending. 0 45 53

No 0 45 54
law 0 45 54
enforcement 0 45 54
agency, 0 45 54
let 0 45 54
alone 0 45 54
the 0 45 54
FBI, 0 45 54
would 0 45 54
waste 0 45 54
its 0 45 54
time 0 45 54
with 0 45 54
an 0 45 54
allegation 0 45 54
of 0 45 54
a 0 45 54
crime 0 45 54
decades 0 45 54
in 0 45 54
the 0 45 54
past, 0 45 54
and 0 45 54
so 0 45 54
patently 0 45 54
incoherent 0 45 54
and 0 45 54
lacking 0 45 54
in 0 45 54
evidence. 0 45 54

The 0 45 55
“FBI 0 45 55
investigation” 0 45 55
is 0 45 55
another 0 45 55
delaying 0 45 55
tactic. 0 45 55

Ford 0 45 56
has 0 45 56
finally 0 45 56
agreed 0 45 56
to 0 45 56
testify, 0 45 56
set 0 45 56
for 0 45 56
Thursday 0 45 56
for 0 45 56
now. 0 45 56

But 0 45 57
it’s 0 45 57
unclear 0 45 57
whether 0 45 57
Grassley 0 45 57
has 0 45 57
granted 0 45 57
Ford 0 45 57
any 0 45 57
of 0 45 57
her 0 45 57
preposterous 1 45 57
conditions 1 45 57
for 0 45 57
testifying: 0 45 57
She 0 45 57
will 0 45 57
take 0 45 57
questions 0 45 57
from 0 45 57
the 0 45 57
Committee, 0 45 57
but 0 45 57
not 0 45 57
from 0 45 57
outside 0 45 57
lawyers, 0 45 57
who 0 45 57
might 0 45 57
not 0 45 57
be 0 45 57
as 0 45 57
gentle 0 45 57
as 0 45 57
politicians 1 45 57
with 1 45 57
one 1 45 57
eye 1 45 57
on 1 45 57
the 1 45 57
polls. 1 45 57

Only 0 45 58
one 0 45 58
camera 0 45 58
can 0 45 58
be 0 45 58
in 0 45 58
the 0 45 58
room. 0 45 58

Kavanaugh 0 45 59
must 0 45 59
testify 0 45 59
first, 0 45 59
a 1 45 59
grotesque 1 45 59
inversion 1 45 59
of 0 45 59
our 1 45 59
bedrock 1 45 59
principle 1 45 59
that 1 45 59
an 1 45 59
accused 1 45 59
has 1 45 59
the 1 45 59
right 1 45 59
to 1 45 59
confront 1 45 59
his 1 45 59
accuser’s 1 45 59
charges. 1 45 59

He 0 45 60
can’t 0 45 60
be 0 45 60
in 0 45 60
the 0 45 60
room 0 45 60
with 0 45 60
her, 0 45 60
apparently 0 45 60
because 0 45 60
she’s 0 45 60
still 0 45 60
traumatized 0 45 60
and 0 45 60
may 0 45 60
start 0 45 60
experiencing 0 45 60
flashbacks. 0 45 60

So 0 45 61
much 0 45 61
for 0 45 61
“I 0 45 61
am 1 45 61
woman, 1 45 61
hear 1 45 61
me 1 45 61
roar.” 1 45 61

Grassley 0 45 62
shouldn’t 0 45 62
cave 0 45 62
on 0 45 62
these 0 45 62
conditions. 0 45 62

They 0 45 63
all 0 45 63
comprise 0 45 63
the 0 45 63
old 0 45 63
tactic 0 45 63
of 0 45 63
serially 0 45 63
escalating 0 45 63
demands 0 45 63
that 0 45 63
cannot 0 45 63
be 0 45 63
satisfied 0 45 63
in 0 45 63
order 0 45 63
to 0 45 63
compel 0 45 63
your 0 45 63
enemy 0 45 63
to 0 45 63
give 0 45 63
in. 0 45 63

That 0 45 64
Grassley 0 45 64
and 0 45 64
the 0 45 64
Republicans 0 45 64
would 0 45 64
even 0 45 64
participate 0 45 64
in 0 45 64
this 0 45 64
absurd 1 45 64
show 1 45 64
trial 1 45 64
is 0 45 64
testimony 0 45 64
to 0 45 64
how 0 45 64
deeply 0 45 64
the 0 45 64
progressive 0 45 64
ideological 0 45 64
narrative 0 45 64
has 0 45 64
burrowed 0 45 64
into 0 45 64
our 0 45 64
social 0 45 64
and 0 45 64
political 0 45 64
life. 0 45 64

If 0 45 65
Ford 0 45 65
actually 0 45 65
testifies 0 45 65
on 0 45 65
Thursday, 0 45 65
or 0 45 65
Ramirez 0 45 65
is 0 45 65
granted 0 45 65
the 0 45 65
same 0 45 65
concession, 0 45 65
nothing 0 45 65
material 0 45 65
will 0 45 65
be 0 45 65
gained. 0 45 65

Her 0 45 66
accusation 0 45 66
will 0 45 66
not 0 45 66
be 0 45 66
proved 0 45 66
true 0 45 66
or 0 45 66
false. 0 45 66

We 0 45 67
will 0 45 67
learn 0 45 67
nothing 0 45 67
about 0 45 67
Kavanaugh 0 45 67
that 0 45 67
makes 0 45 67
him 0 45 67
any 0 45 67
less 0 45 67
eminently 0 45 67
qualified 0 45 67
for 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
Supreme 0 45 67
Court, 0 45 67
nothing 0 45 67
that 0 45 67
can 0 45 67
add 0 45 67
to 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
thousands 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
pages 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
documents 0 45 67
already 0 45 67
presented 0 45 67
to 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
Committee, 0 45 67
or 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
hundreds 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
hours 0 45 67
of 0 45 67
the 0 45 67
judge’s 0 45 67
testimony 0 45 67
before 0 45 67
rabid 1 45 67
partisans 1 45 67
and 1 45 67
office-seekers. 1 45 67

But 0 45 68
vetting 0 45 68
Kavanaugh’s 0 45 68
qualifications 0 45 68
isn’t 0 45 68
the 0 45 68
point. 0 45 68

The 0 45 69
point 0 45 69
is 0 45 69
to 0 45 69
delay 0 45 69
confirmation 0 45 69
by 0 45 69
slandering 0 45 69
Kavanaugh 0 45 69
and 0 45 69
baiting 0 45 69
the 0 45 69
Republicans 0 45 69
into 0 45 69
appearing 0 45 69
to 0 45 69
abuse 0 45 69
victims 0 45 69
of 0 45 69
sexual 0 45 69
assault. 0 45 69

Why? 0 45 70

Facing 0 45 71
his 0 45 71
likely 0 45 71
confirmation, 0 45 71
the 1 45 71
Dems, 1 45 71
egged 0 45 71
on 0 45 71
by 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
mainstream 0 45 71
media––especially 0 45 71
The 0 45 71
New 0 45 71
Yorker, 0 45 71
which 0 45 71
published 0 45 71
a 0 45 71
story 0 45 71
too 0 45 71
badly 0 45 71
sourced 0 45 71
even 0 45 71
for 0 45 71
The 0 45 71
New 0 45 71
York 0 45 71
Times–– 0 45 71
are 0 45 71
desperately 0 45 71
attempting 0 45 71
to 0 45 71
obstruct 0 45 71
and 0 45 71
delay 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
process 0 45 71
until 0 45 71
after 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
midterm 0 45 71
elections, 0 45 71
when 0 45 71
they 0 45 71
hope 0 45 71
they 0 45 71
will 0 45 71
retake 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
Senate 0 45 71
and 0 45 71
thus 0 45 71
stop 0 45 71
any 0 45 71
more 0 45 71
Constitutionalist 0 45 71
judges 0 45 71
from 0 45 71
being 0 45 71
confirmed 0 45 71
to 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
Court 0 45 71
for 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
rest 0 45 71
of 0 45 71
Trump’s 0 45 71
term. 0 45 71

The 0 45 72
Democrats 0 45 72
have 0 45 72
stooped 1 45 72
so 1 45 72
low 1 45 72
with 1 45 72
these 1 45 72
smears 1 45 72
because 0 45 72
they 0 45 72
know 0 45 72
the 0 45 72
stakes. 0 45 72

The 0 45 73
courts 0 45 73
and 0 45 73
especially 0 45 73
the 0 45 73
Supreme 0 45 73
Court 0 45 73
have 0 45 73
been 0 45 73
critical 0 45 73
to 0 45 73
the 0 45 73
progressives’ 0 45 73
program 0 45 73
since 0 45 73
Woodrow 0 45 73
Wilson. 0 45 73

The 0 45 74
biggest 0 45 74
obstacle 0 45 74
to 0 45 74
the 0 45 74
progressive 0 45 74
dream 0 45 74
of 0 45 74
government 0 45 74
controlled 0 45 74
and 0 45 74
managed 0 45 74
by 0 45 74
a 0 45 74
technocratic 0 45 74
oligarchy 0 45 74
has 0 45 74
been 0 45 74
the 0 45 74
Constitution. 0 45 74

Its 0 45 75
divided 0 45 75
and 0 45 75
balanced 0 45 75
powers 0 45 75
were 0 45 75
designed 0 45 75
precisely 0 45 75
to 0 45 75
rein 0 45 75
in 0 45 75
overreaching 0 45 75
ambition 0 45 75
and 0 45 75
concentrations 0 45 75
of 0 45 75
power. 0 45 75

Hence 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Constitutional 0 45 76
order 0 45 76
must 0 45 76
be 0 45 76
subverted 0 45 76
by 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Supreme 0 45 76
Court 0 45 76
and 0 45 76
its 0 45 76
unaccountable 0 45 76
justices 0 45 76
enjoying 0 45 76
lifelong 0 45 76
tenure. 0 45 76

But 0 45 77
if 0 45 77
Kavanaugh 0 45 77
is 0 45 77
confirmed, 0 45 77
there 0 45 77
will 0 45 77
be 0 45 77
five 0 45 77
reliably 0 45 77
Constitutionalist 0 45 77
justices 0 45 77
on 0 45 77
the 0 45 77
bench, 0 45 77
who 0 45 77
are 0 45 77
unlikely 0 45 77
to 0 45 77
tolerate 0 45 77
judicial 0 45 77
usurpation 0 45 77
of 0 45 77
Congress’s 0 45 77
law-making 0 45 77
powers. 0 45 77

That’s 0 45 78
why 0 45 78
this 0 45 78
current 0 45 78
nomination 0 45 78
is 0 45 78
a 0 45 78
hill 0 45 78
the 1 45 78
Dems 1 45 78
are 0 45 78
willing 0 45 78
to 1 45 78
beclown 1 45 78
themselves 1 45 78
on. 1 45 78

Given 0 45 79
how 0 45 79
obviously 1 45 79
partisan 1 45 79
and 1 45 79
hypocritical 1 45 79
this 0 45 79
ploy 0 45 79
is––doesn’t 0 45 79
Keith 0 45 79
Ellison’s 0 45 79
accuser 0 45 79
deserve 0 45 79
to 0 45 79
be 0 45 79
heard 0 45 79
and 0 45 79
believed 0 45 79
too? 0 45 79

––why 1 45 80
has 1 45 80
Grassley 1 45 80
so 1 45 80
far 1 45 80
allowed 1 45 80
himself 1 45 80
to 1 45 80
be 1 45 80
played 1 45 80
by 1 45 80
the 1 45 80
Dems? 1 45 80

Because 0 45 81
Republicans 0 45 81
fear 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
backlash 0 45 81
from 0 45 81
all 0 45 81
those 0 45 81
women 0 45 81
voters 0 45 81
who 0 45 81
presumably 0 45 81
agree 0 45 81
with 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
fundamentalist 0 45 81
feminists, 0 45 81
and 0 45 81
insist 0 45 81
that 0 45 81
every 1 45 81
accusation 1 45 81
of 1 45 81
sexual 1 45 81
assault, 1 45 81
no 1 45 81
matter 1 45 81
how 1 45 81
much 1 45 81
it’s 1 45 81
unsupported 1 45 81
by 1 45 81
corroborating 1 45 81
evidence 1 45 81
or 1 45 81
even 1 45 81
plausibility, 1 45 81
must 1 45 81
be 1 45 81
believed. 1 45 81

This 0 45 82
contention 0 45 82
itself 0 45 82
is 0 45 82
an 0 45 82
expression 0 45 82
of 0 45 82
the 0 45 82
radical 0 45 82
feminist 0 45 82
narrative 0 45 82
of 0 45 82
innate 0 45 82
male 0 45 82
feral 1 45 82
sexuality 1 45 82
that 0 45 82
makes 0 45 82
them 0 45 82
sexual 1 45 82
predators. 1 45 82

The 0 45 83
irony 0 45 83
is 0 45 83
that 0 45 83
today’s 0 45 83
feminists 0 45 83
have 0 45 83
been 0 45 83
willing 0 45 83
to 0 45 83
sacrifice 0 45 83
the 0 45 83
earlier 0 45 83
narrative 0 45 83
of 0 45 83
female 0 45 83
power 0 45 83
and 0 45 83
agency 0 45 83
that 0 45 83
had 0 45 83
been 0 45 83
stifled 0 45 83
by 0 45 83
traditional 0 45 83
views 0 45 83
of 0 45 83
the 0 45 83
sexes 0 45 83
and 0 45 83
their 0 45 83
capabilities. 0 45 83

Instead, 0 45 84
now 0 45 84
women 0 45 84
are 0 45 84
Victorian 1 45 84
hothouse 1 45 84
flowers 1 45 84
too 0 45 84
delicate 0 45 84
to 0 45 84
make 0 45 84
their 0 45 84
way 0 45 84
through 0 45 84
their 0 45 84
lives 0 45 84
without 0 45 84
the 0 45 84
paternal 0 45 84
federal 0 45 84
government 0 45 84
protecting 0 45 84
them 0 45 84
with 0 45 84
its 0 45 84
coercive 0 45 84
power. 0 45 84

Women 0 45 85
have 0 45 85
exchanged 0 45 85
one 0 45 85
form 0 45 85
of 0 45 85
dependence, 0 45 85
and 0 45 85
one 0 45 85
double 0 45 85
standard 0 45 85
for 0 45 85
another. 0 45 85

The 1 45 86
Dems 1 45 86
are 0 45 86
using 0 45 86
Ford 0 45 86
and 0 45 86
Ramirez 0 45 86
as 0 45 86
part 0 45 86
of 0 45 86
the 0 45 86
Democrats’ 0 45 86
transparently 0 45 86
dishonest 0 45 86
delaying 0 45 86
tactics 0 45 86
because 0 45 86
they 0 45 86
know 0 45 86
that 0 45 86
most 0 45 86
Republicans 0 45 86
have 0 45 86
accepted 0 45 86
this 0 45 86
duplicitous 0 45 86
feminist 0 45 86
narrative 0 45 86
and 0 45 86
fear 0 45 86
challenging 0 45 86
it. 0 45 86

Especially 0 45 87
after 0 45 87
the 0 45 87
recent 0 45 87
spate 0 45 87
of 0 45 87
sexual 0 45 87
assault 0 45 87
charges––many 0 45 87
of 0 45 87
them 0 45 87
true, 0 45 87
some 0 45 87
false, 0 45 87
others 0 45 87
contested–– 0 45 87
politicians 0 45 87
consider 0 45 87
bucking 0 45 87
the 0 45 87
narrative 0 45 87
to 0 45 87
be 0 45 87
as 0 45 87
politically 1 45 87
suicidal 1 45 87
as 0 45 87
proposing 0 45 87
to 0 45 87
reform 0 45 87
Social 0 45 87
Security 0 45 87
and 0 45 87
Medicare. 0 45 87

It’s 0 45 88
the 0 45 88
new 0 45 88
third 0 45 88
rail 0 45 88
of 0 45 88
American 0 45 88
politics, 0 45 88
one 0 45 88
that 0 45 88
transcends 0 45 88
party 0 45 88
affiliation. 0 45 88

Hence 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
widespread 0 45 89
virtue-signaling 0 45 89
on 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
part 0 45 89
even 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
conservative 0 45 89
writers 0 45 89
who 0 45 89
preface 0 45 89
their 0 45 89
comments 0 45 89
about 0 45 89
Ford 0 45 89
and 0 45 89
Ramirez 0 45 89
with 0 45 89
prologues 0 45 89
full 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
truisms 0 45 89
about 0 45 89
how 0 45 89
horrible 0 45 89
sexual 0 45 89
assault 0 45 89
is, 0 45 89
how 0 45 89
its 0 45 89
self-proclaimed 0 45 89
victims 0 45 89
“must 0 45 89
be 0 45 89
heard,” 0 45 89
and 0 45 89
how 0 45 89
churlish 0 45 89
and 0 45 89
sexist 0 45 89
it 0 45 89
is 0 45 89
to 0 45 89
question 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
truth 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
any 0 45 89
charge. 0 45 89

Grown-ups 0 45 90
know 0 45 90
all 0 45 90
that 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
don’t 0 45 90
have 0 45 90
to 0 45 90
be 0 45 90
reminded 0 45 90
every 0 45 90
time 0 45 90
the 0 45 90
subject 0 45 90
arises. 0 45 90

The 1 45 91
Dems 1 45 91
know 0 45 91
that 0 45 91
most 0 45 91
Republicans 0 45 91
come 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
this 0 45 91
conflict 0 45 91
with 0 45 91
the 0 45 91
huge 0 45 91
disadvantage 0 45 91
that 0 45 91
results 0 45 91
from 0 45 91
accepting 0 45 91
your 0 45 91
opponent’s 0 45 91
dubious 1 45 91
ideology 1 45 91
and 1 45 91
dishonest 1 45 91
narrative. 1 45 91

The 0 45 92
progressive 0 45 92
party 0 45 92
can 0 45 92
dare 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
Republicans 0 45 92
to 0 45 92
ignore 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
endless 0 45 92
specious 0 45 92
demands, 0 45 92
stop 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
show-trial, 0 45 92
and 0 45 92
proceed 0 45 92
to 0 45 92
a 0 45 92
vote 0 45 92
on 0 45 92
Kavanaugh, 0 45 92
because 0 45 92
they 0 45 92
know 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
Republicans, 0 45 92
fearful 0 45 92
of 0 45 92
the 0 45 92
“optics,” 0 45 92
will 0 45 92
cave. 0 45 92

They 0 45 93
know 0 45 93
that 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
eleven 0 45 93
male 0 45 93
Republican 0 45 93
Senators 0 45 93
on 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
Judiciary 0 45 93
Committee 0 45 93
dread 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
#MeToo 0 45 93
movement 0 45 93
casting 0 45 93
them 0 45 93
as 0 45 93
knuckle-dragging 1 45 93
Neanderthal 1 45 93
sexists 1 45 93
who 0 45 93
want 0 45 93
to 0 45 93
“silence” 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
accuser 0 45 93
with 0 45 93
their 0 45 93
“cavalier 1 45 93
treatment 1 45 93
of 0 45 93
a 0 45 93
sexual 0 45 93
assault 0 45 93
survivor,” 0 45 93
as 0 45 93
one 0 45 93
Ford 0 45 93
lawyer 0 45 93
has 0 45 93
said. 0 45 93

Republicans 0 45 94
still 0 45 94
don’t 0 45 94
get 0 45 94
that 0 45 94
no 0 45 94
amount 0 45 94
of 0 45 94
appeasement 0 45 94
will 0 45 94
stop 0 45 94
the 0 45 94
left 0 45 94
from 0 45 94
demonizing 1 45 94
them 1 45 94
anyway. 0 45 94

Just 0 45 95
ask 0 45 95
Boy 0 45 95
Scout 0 45 95
Mitt 0 45 95
Romney, 0 45 95
who 1 45 95
was 1 45 95
savaged 1 45 95
for 0 45 95
his 0 45 95
innocuous 0 45 95
“binders 0 45 95
full 0 45 95
of 0 45 95
women.” 0 45 95

And 0 45 96
don’t 0 45 96
forget, 0 45 96
the 0 45 96
old 0 45 96
sorta, 0 45 96
kinda 0 45 96
moderate 0 45 96
Democrats 0 45 96
like 0 45 96
Feinstein 0 45 96
and 0 45 96
Chuck 0 45 96
Schumer, 0 45 96
who 0 45 96
now 0 45 96
have 0 45 96
joined 0 45 96
the 0 45 96
crowd 0 45 96
of 0 45 96
trendoid 1 45 96
socialists 1 45 96
armed 1 45 96
with 1 45 96
torches 1 45 96
and 1 45 96
pitch-forks, 1 45 96
will 0 45 96
go 0 45 96
along 0 45 96
because 0 45 96
they’re 0 45 96
frightened 0 45 96
of 0 45 96
their 0 45 96
party’s 0 45 96
increasingly 1 45 96
rabid 1 45 96
left-wing 1 45 96
base. 1 45 96

What 0 45 97
can 0 45 97
we 0 45 97
do 0 45 97
to 0 45 97
end 0 45 97
these 0 45 97
confirmation 1 45 97
circuses? 1 45 97

Just 0 45 98
stop 0 45 98
holding 0 45 98
them. 0 45 98

There’s 0 45 99
nothing 0 45 99
in 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
Constitution 0 45 99
that 0 45 99
says 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
Senate’s 0 45 99
power 0 45 99
to 0 45 99
give 0 45 99
“advice 0 45 99
and 0 45 99
consent” 0 45 99
to 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
president 0 45 99
regarding 0 45 99
his 0 45 99
nominee 0 45 99
must 0 45 99
entail 0 45 99
days 0 45 99
of 0 45 99
televised 0 45 99
hearings 0 45 99
replete 0 45 99
with 0 45 99
caterwauling 1 45 99
protestors 1 45 99
and 1 45 99
grandstanding 1 45 99
Senators 1 45 99
who’ve 0 45 99
already 0 45 99
made-up 0 45 99
their 0 45 99
minds. 0 45 99

Invite 0 45 100
written 0 45 100
questions 0 45 100
from 0 45 100
the 0 45 100
Senate, 0 45 100
then 0 45 100
schedule 0 45 100
one 0 45 100
day 0 45 100
for 0 45 100
the 0 45 100
nominee 0 45 100
to 0 45 100
respond. 0 45 100

Don’t 0 45 101
put 0 45 101
it 0 45 101
on 0 45 101
television, 0 45 101
but 0 45 101
make 0 45 101
public 0 45 101
a 0 45 101
written 0 45 101
transcript. 0 45 101

Remove 0 45 102
the 0 45 102
television 0 45 102
cameras, 0 45 102
and 0 45 102
attention-craving, 1 45 102
politically 1 45 102
ambitious 1 45 102
Senators 1 45 102
will 0 45 102
be 0 45 102
gone 0 45 102
like 0 45 102
a 0 45 102
cool 0 45 102
breeze. 0 45 102

For 0 45 103
now, 0 45 103
Grassley 0 45 103
needs 0 45 103
to 0 45 103
end 0 45 103
this 0 45 103
farce 1 45 103
if 0 45 103
Ford 0 45 103
doesn’t 0 45 103
show 0 45 103
up 0 45 103
on 0 45 103
Thursday 0 45 103
or 0 45 103
continues 0 45 103
to 0 45 103
negotiate 0 45 103
for 0 45 103
more 0 45 103
delays 0 45 103
and 0 45 103
concessions. 0 45 103

No 0 45 104
more 0 45 104
concessions. 0 45 104

No 0 45 105
more 0 45 105
delays. 0 45 105

No 1 45 106
more 1 45 106
ceding 0 45 106
control 0 45 106
of 0 45 106
the 0 45 106
process 0 45 106
to 0 45 106
Democrat 0 45 106
Party 0 45 106
lawyers. 0 45 106

Don’t 0 45 107
give 0 45 107
Ramirez 0 45 107
the 0 45 107
time 0 45 107
of 0 45 107
day. 0 45 107

Hold 0 45 108
the 0 45 108
vote 0 45 108
no 0 45 108
later 0 45 108
than 0 45 108
Thursday, 0 45 108
or 0 45 108
Friday 0 45 108
if 0 45 108
Ford 0 45 108
does 0 45 108
show 0 45 108
up. 0 45 108

Make 0 45 109
Senators 0 45 109
go 0 45 109
on 0 45 109
the 0 45 109
record 0 45 109
with 0 45 109
their 0 45 109
votes, 0 45 109
and 0 45 109
hold 0 45 109
them 0 45 109
to 0 45 109
account 0 45 109
in 0 45 109
November. 0 45 109

Put 0 45 110
to 0 45 110
the 0 45 110
test 0 45 110
the 1 45 110
Dems’ 1 45 110
claims 0 45 110
that 0 45 110
a 0 45 110
critical 0 45 110
mass 0 45 110
of 0 45 110
women, 0 45 110
many 0 45 110
of 0 45 110
them 0 45 110
with 0 45 110
sons 0 45 110
they 0 45 110
don’t 0 45 110
want 0 45 110
falsely 0 45 110
accused, 0 45 110
believes 0 45 110
the 0 45 110
fundamentalist 0 45 110
feminist 0 45 110
narrative 0 45 110
and 0 45 110
will 0 45 110
vote 0 45 110
accordingly. 0 45 110

To 0 45 111
borrow 0 45 111
Churchill’s 0 45 111
definition 0 45 111
of 0 45 111
appeasement, 0 45 111
stop 1 45 111
feeding 1 45 111
the 1 45 111
alligator 1 45 111
in 1 45 111
the 1 45 111
hopes 1 45 111
that 1 45 111
you 1 45 111
will 1 45 111
be 1 45 111
eaten 1 45 111
last. 1 45 111

For 0 45 112
fifty 0 45 112
years 0 45 112
the 0 45 112
Democrats 0 45 112
have 0 45 112
proven 0 45 112
they 1 45 112
will 1 45 112
demonize 1 45 112
conservatives 0 45 112
as 0 45 112
racist 0 45 112
and 0 45 112
sexist 0 45 112
no 0 45 112
matter 0 45 112
how 0 45 112
often 0 45 112
they 0 45 112
bow 0 45 112
and 0 45 112
scrape. 0 45 112

How 0 45 113
about 0 45 113
acting 0 45 113
on 0 45 113
principle 0 45 113
for 0 45 113

The 0 46 1
incident 0 46 1
was 0 46 1
brief: 0 46 1
on 0 46 1
the 0 46 1
Thursday 0 46 1
of 0 46 1
the 0 46 1
pope’s 0 46 1
week-long 0 46 1
South 0 46 1
American 0 46 1
trip, 0 46 1
in 0 46 1
response 0 46 1
to 0 46 1
an 0 46 1
impromptu 0 46 1
question 0 46 1
tossed 1 46 1
out 1 46 1
by 0 46 1
a 0 46 1
Chilean 0 46 1
reporter, 0 46 1
the 0 46 1
pope 0 46 1
responded 0 46 1
in 0 46 1
what 0 46 1
one 0 46 1
reporter 0 46 1
described 0 46 1
as 0 46 1
a 0 46 1
“snippy 1 46 1
tone”: 1 46 1
“The 0 46 1
day 0 46 1
I 0 46 1
see 0 46 1
proof 0 46 1
against 0 46 1
Bishop 0 46 1
Barros, 0 46 1
then 0 46 1
I 0 46 1
will 0 46 1
talk. 0 46 1

There 0 46 2
is 0 46 2
not 0 46 2
a 0 46 2
single 0 46 2
piece 0 46 2
of 0 46 2
evidence 0 46 2
against 0 46 2
him. 0 46 2

It 0 46 3
is 0 46 3
all 0 46 3
calumny. 0 46 3

Is 0 46 4
that 0 46 4
clear?” 0 46 4

This 0 46 5
month 0 46 5
has 0 46 5
been 0 46 5
quite 0 46 5
a 0 46 5
spectacle, 0 46 5
even 0 46 5
for 0 46 5
this 0 46 5
pontificate; 0 46 5
an 0 46 5
apparently 0 46 5
unending 1 46 5
stream 1 46 5
of 1 46 5
outrages 1 46 5
and 1 46 5
embarrassments, 1 46 5
with 0 46 5
the 0 46 5
pope 0 46 5
and 0 46 5
his 0 46 5
Vatican 0 46 5
media 0 46 5
support 0 46 5
jumping 0 46 5
from 0 46 5
one 0 46 5
scandal 0 46 5
to 0 46 5
the 0 46 5
next. 0 46 5

But 0 46 6
among 0 46 6
secular 0 46 6
reporters 0 46 6
the 0 46 6
sex 0 46 6
abuse 0 46 6

At 0 46 15

The 0 46 16

the 0 46 20
church’s 0 46 20

She 0 46 21
asked: 0 46 21
‘Why 0 46 21

no 0 46 22

Indeed, 0 46 23
it 0 46 23
was 0 46 23
understood, 0 46 23
as 0 46 23
the 0 46 23

why 0 46 24
his 0 46 24

victims 0 46 24

made 0 46 27
all 0 46 27
the 0 46 27
right 0 46 27
noises, 0 46 27
talking 0 46 27
about 0 46 27
his 0 46 27
“pain 0 46 27
and 0 46 27
shame,” 0 46 27
and 0 46 27
reportedly 0 46 27
even 0 46 27
crying, 0 46 27
at 0 46 27
what 0 46 27
happened. 0 46 27

“I 0 46 28

Jesus 0 46 36
church 0 46 36

Santiago. 0 46 36

Last 0 46 37
Thursday, 0 46 37
however, 0 46 37
was 0 46 37
not 0 46 37
the 0 46 37
first 0 46 37
time 0 46 37
Francis, 0 46 37
confronted 0 46 37
unexpectedly 0 46 37
in 0 46 37
public 0 46 37
over 0 46 37
the 0 46 37
Barros 0 46 37
question, 0 46 37
has 0 46 37
responded 0 46 37
testily 0 46 37
and 0 46 37
with 0 46 37
insults. 0 46 37

In 0 46 38
2015 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
Italian 0 46 38
newspaper 0 46 38
Il 0 46 38
Fatto 0 46 38
Quotidiano 0 46 38
published 0 46 38
a 0 46 38
video 0 46 38
of 0 46 38
him 0 46 38
scolding 0 46 38
two 0 46 38
women 0 46 38
who 0 46 38
spoke 0 46 38
with 0 46 38
him 0 46 38
in 0 46 38
St. 0 46 38
Peter’s 0 46 38
Piazza, 0 46 38
asking 0 46 38
that 0 46 38
he 0 46 38
reconsider 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
appointment, 0 46 38
citing 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
“suffering” 0 46 38
of 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
Church 0 46 38
in 0 46 38
Chile 0 46 38
over 0 46 38
the 0 46 38
issue. 0 46 38

The 0 46 39
pope 0 46 39
told 0 46 39
the 0 46 39
women, 0 46 39
“The 0 46 39
Church 0 46 39
has 0 46 39
lost 0 46 39
its 0 46 39
freedom, 0 46 39
letting 0 46 39
its 0 46 39
head 0 46 39
fill 0 46 39
with 0 46 39
politicians 0 46 39
and 0 46 39
accusing 0 46 39
a 0 46 39
bishop 0 46 39
without 0 46 39
having 0 46 39
any 0 46 39
proof, 0 46 39
after 0 46 39
twenty 0 46 39
years 0 46 39
of 0 46 39
service, 0 46 39
so 0 46 39
think 1 46 39
with 1 46 39
your 1 46 39
head.” 1 46 39
He 0 46 39
warned 0 46 39
them 0 46 39
not 0 46 39
to 0 46 39
allow 0 46 39
themselves 0 46 39
to 0 46 39
be 0 46 39
led 0 46 39
by 0 46 39
“leftists 1 46 39
who 1 46 39
have 1 46 39
set 1 46 39
up 1 46 39
this 1 46 39
thing.” 1 46 39

“The 0 46 40
only 0 46 40
charge 0 46 40
against 0 46 40
this 0 46 40
bishop 0 46 40
has 0 46 40
been 0 46 40
discredited 0 46 40
by 0 46 40
the 0 46 40
Court 0 46 40
of 0 46 40
Justice, 0 46 40
so 0 46 40
please 0 46 40
do 0 46 40
not 0 46 40
lose 0 46 40
your 0 46 40
serenity, 0 46 40
you 0 46 40
suffer, 0 46 40
but 0 46 40
because 0 46 40
you 1 46 40
are 1 46 40
foolish...I 1 46 40
am 0 46 40
the 0 46 40
first 0 46 40
to 0 46 40
judge 0 46 40
and 0 46 40
punish 0 46 40
those 0 46 40
accused 0 46 40
of 0 46 40
similar 0 46 40
crimes, 0 46 40
but 0 46 40
in 0 46 40
this 0 46 40
case 0 46 40
there 0 46 40
is 0 46 40
not 0 46 40
even 0 46 40
a 0 46 40
proof.” 0 46 40

The 0 46 41
insults 0 46 41
were 0 46 41
not 0 46 41
forgotten. 0 46 41

Among 0 46 42
the 0 46 42
signs 0 46 42
held 0 46 42
by 0 46 42
protesters 0 46 42
in 0 46 42
Chile 0 46 42
last 0 46 42
week 0 46 42
were 0 46 42
those 0 46 42
reading, 0 46 42
“Ni 0 46 42
zurdos, 0 46 42
ni 0 46 42
tontos,” 0 46 42
(Neither 1 46 42
lefties 1 46 42
nor 1 46 42
stupid). 1 46 42

The 0 46 43
jab 0 46 43
certainly 0 46 43
wasn’t 0 46 43
lost 0 46 43
on 0 46 43
Francis, 0 46 43
since 0 46 43
the 0 46 43
signs 0 46 43
were 0 46 43
being 0 46 43
held 0 46 43
by 0 46 43
protesters 0 46 43
the 0 46 43
full 0 46 43
length 0 46 43
of 0 46 43
his 0 46 43
auto 0 46 43
route 0 46 43
to 0 46 43
Santiago 0 46 43
from 0 46 43
the 0 46 43
airport. 0 46 43

One 0 46 44
of 0 46 44
the 0 46 44
protesters 0 46 44
told 0 46 44
the 0 46 44
BBC, 0 46 44
“He 0 46 44
doesn’t 0 46 44
even 0 46 44
know 0 46 44
us, 0 46 44
so 0 46 44
how 0 46 44
can 0 46 44
he 0 46 44
accuse 0 46 44
us 0 46 44
of 0 46 44
being 0 46 44
such 0 46 44
things? 0 46 44

He 0 46 45
thinks 0 46 45
we 0 46 45
are 0 46 45
politically 0 46 45
motivated 0 46 45
even 0 46 45
though 0 46 45
we 0 46 45
come 0 46 45
from 0 46 45
different 0 46 45
parishes 0 46 45
in 0 46 45
Osorno 0 46 45
and 0 46 45
are 0 46 45
doing 0 46 45
this 0 46 45
because 0 46 45
we 0 46 45
are 0 46 45
against 0 46 45
priests 0 46 45
being 0 46 45
allowed 0 46 45
to 0 46 45
abuse 0 46 45
children.” 0 46 45

Apparently 0 46 46
His 0 46 46
Holiness 0 46 46
was 0 46 46
informed 0 46 46
that 0 46 46
the 0 46 46
“calumny” 1 46 46
comment 1 46 46
had 0 46 46
caused 0 46 46
some 0 46 46
blow-back 0 46 46
because 0 46 46
a 0 46 46
couple 0 46 46
of 0 46 46
days 0 46 46
later 0 46 46
we 0 46 46
got 0 46 46
something 0 46 46
touted 0 46 46
– 0 46 46
though 0 46 46
somewhat 0 46 46
skeptically 0 46 46
– 0 46 46
as 0 46 46
a 0 46 46
“contrite” 0 46 46
papal 0 46 46
apology. 0 46 46

This 0 46 47
also 0 46 47
followed 0 46 47
an 0 46 47
astonishing 0 46 47
public 0 46 47
rebuke 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
pope 0 46 47
by 0 46 47
Sean 0 46 47
Cardinal 0 46 47
O’Malley 0 46 47
– 0 46 47
a 0 46 47
member 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
C9 0 46 47
council 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
cardinals 0 46 47
and 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
former 0 46 47
head 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
the 0 46 47
pope’s 0 46 47
sex 0 46 47
abuse 0 46 47
commission 0 46 47
– 0 46 47
who 0 46 47
said, 0 46 47
“It 0 46 47
is 0 46 47
understandable 0 46 47
that 0 46 47
Pope 0 46 47
Francis’ 0 46 47
statements 0 46 47
yesterday 0 46 47
in 0 46 47
Santiago, 0 46 47
Chile 0 46 47
were 0 46 47
a 0 46 47
source 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
great 0 46 47
pain 0 46 47
for 0 46 47
survivors 0 46 47
of 0 46 47
sexual 0 46 47
abuse 0 46 47
by 0 46 47
clergy 0 46 47
or 0 46 47
any 0 46 47
other 0 46 47
perpetrator.” 0 46 47

“Pope 0 46 48
Francis 0 46 48
fully 0 46 48
recognizes 0 46 48
the 1 46 48
egregious 1 46 48
failures 1 46 48
of 0 46 48
the 0 46 48
Church 0 46 48
and 0 46 48
its 0 46 48
clergy 0 46 48
who 0 46 48
abused 0 46 48
children 0 46 48
and 0 46 48
the 0 46 48
devastating 1 46 48
impact 1 46 48
those 0 46 48
crimes 0 46 48
have 0 46 48
had 0 46 48
on 0 46 48
survivors 0 46 48
and 0 46 48
their 0 46 48
loved 0 46 48
ones,” 0 46 48
O’Malley 0 46 48
said. 0 46 48

Of 0 46 49
course, 0 46 49
Francis 0 46 49
being 0 46 49
Francis 0 46 49
the 0 46 49
apology 0 46 49
was 0 46 49
banked 0 46 49
around 0 46 49
with 0 46 49
assertions 0 46 49
of 0 46 49
how 0 46 49
right 0 46 49
he 0 46 49
was. 0 46 49

“I 0 46 50
have 0 46 50
to 0 46 50
ask 0 46 50
forgiveness 0 46 50
because 0 46 50
the 0 46 50
word 0 46 50
‘proof’ 0 46 50
wounded,” 0 46 50
he 0 46 50
said. 0 46 50

“It 0 46 51
wounded 0 46 51
many 0 46 51
people 0 46 51
who 0 46 51
were 0 46 51
abused…I 0 46 51
ask 0 46 51
them 0 46 51
for 0 46 51
forgiveness 0 46 51
because 0 46 51
I 0 46 51
wounded 0 46 51
them 0 46 51
without 0 46 51
realizing 0 46 51
it, 0 46 51
but 0 46 51
it 0 46 51
was 0 46 51
an 0 46 51
unintended 0 46 51
wound. 0 46 51

And 0 46 52
this 1 46 52
horrified 1 46 52
me 1 46 52
a 1 46 52
lot, 1 46 52
because 0 46 52
I 0 46 52
had 0 46 52
received 0 46 52
them.” 0 46 52

“And 0 46 53
I 0 46 53
know 0 46 53
how 0 46 53
much 0 46 53
they 0 46 53
suffer, 0 46 53
to 0 46 53
feel 0 46 53
that 0 46 53
the 0 46 53
Pope 0 46 53
says 0 46 53
in 0 46 53
their 0 46 53
face 0 46 53
‘bring 0 46 53
me 0 46 53
a 0 46 53
letter, 0 46 53
a 0 46 53
proof.’ 0 46 53
It’s 0 46 53
a 0 46 53
slap. 0 46 53

And 0 46 54
I 0 46 54
agree 0 46 54
that 0 46 54
my 0 46 54
expression 0 46 54
was 0 46 54
not 0 46 54
apt, 0 46 54
because 0 46 54
I 0 46 54
didn’t 0 46 54
think.” 0 46 54

He 0 46 55
doubled 0 46 55
down, 0 46 55
saying, 0 46 55
“I 0 46 55
have 0 46 55
not 0 46 55
heard 0 46 55
any 0 46 55
victim 0 46 55
of 0 46 55
Barros. 0 46 55

They 0 46 56
did 0 46 56
not 0 46 56
come, 0 46 56
they 0 46 56
did 0 46 56
not 0 46 56
show 0 46 56
themselves, 0 46 56
they 0 46 56
did 0 46 56
not 0 46 56
give 0 46 56
evidence 0 46 56
in 0 46 56
court. 0 46 56

It’s 1 46 57
all 1 46 57
in 1 46 57
the 1 46 57
air. 1 46 57

It 0 46 58
is 0 46 58
true 0 46 58
that 0 46 58
Barros 0 46 58
was 0 46 58
in 0 46 58
Karadima’s 0 46 58
group 0 46 58
of 0 46 58
young 0 46 58
people. 0 46 58

But 0 46 59
let 0 46 59
us 0 46 59
be 0 46 59
clear: 0 46 59
if 0 46 59
you 0 46 59
accuse 0 46 59
someone 0 46 59
without 0 46 59
evidence 0 46 59
with 0 46 59
pertinacity, 0 46 59
that 0 46 59
is 0 46 59
calumny.” 0 46 59

“This 0 46 60
is 0 46 60
what 0 46 60
I 0 46 60
can 0 46 60
say 0 46 60
with 0 46 60
sincerity. 0 46 60

Barros 0 46 61
will 0 46 61
remain 0 46 61
there 0 46 61
if 0 46 61
I 0 46 61
don’t 0 46 61
find 0 46 61
a 0 46 61
way 0 46 61
to 0 46 61
condemn 0 46 61
him. 0 46 61

I 0 46 62
cannot 0 46 62
condemn 0 46 62
him 0 46 62
if 0 46 62
I 0 46 62
don’t 0 46 62
have 0 46 62
– 0 46 62
I 0 46 62
don’t 0 46 62
say 0 46 62
proof 0 46 62
– 0 46 62
but 0 46 62
evidence. 0 46 62

And 0 46 63
there 0 46 63
are 0 46 63
many 0 46 63
ways 0 46 63
to 0 46 63
get 0 46 63
evidence. 0 46 63

Is 0 46 64
that 0 46 64
clear?” 0 46 64

This 0 46 65
“contrite” 0 46 65
papal 0 46 65
apology 0 46 65
didn’t 0 46 65
fly 0 46 65
well 0 46 65
even 0 46 65
with 0 46 65
the 0 46 65
regular 0 46 65
news 0 46 65
reporters. 0 46 65

Philip 0 46 66
Pullela, 0 46 66
a 0 46 66
reporter 0 46 66
on 0 46 66
the 0 46 66
plane 0 46 66
for 0 46 66
Reuters, 0 46 66
described 0 46 66
it 0 46 66
as 0 46 66
“an 0 46 66
extremely 0 46 66
rare 0 46 66
act 0 46 66
of 0 46 66
self-criticism,” 0 46 66
for 0 46 66
the 0 46 66
“unusually 1 46 66
contrite” 1 46 66
Bergoglio, 0 46 66
and 0 46 66
noted 0 46 66
that, 0 46 66
“While 0 46 66
the 0 46 66
pope 0 46 66
has 0 46 66
vowed 0 46 66
‘zero 0 46 66
tolerance’ 0 46 66
for 0 46 66
sexual 0 46 66
abuse, 0 46 66
his 0 46 66
efforts 0 46 66
have 0 46 66
sputtered.” 0 46 66

Indeed, 0 46 67
Francis 0 46 67
claim 0 46 67
that 0 46 67
he 0 46 67
met 0 46 67
with 0 46 67
and 0 46 67
heard 0 46 67
the 0 46 67
“pain” 0 46 67
of 0 46 67
the 0 46 67
victims 0 46 67
is 0 46 67
untrue 0 46 67
in 0 46 67
the 0 46 67
specific 0 46 67
case 0 46 67
in 0 46 67
hand. 0 46 67

CBS 0 46 68
News 0 46 68
reports 0 46 68
that 0 46 68
though 0 46 68
the 0 46 68
Osorno 0 46 68
group 0 46 68
had 0 46 68
tried 0 46 68
to 0 46 68
obtain 0 46 68
a 0 46 68
meeting 0 46 68
during 0 46 68
the 0 46 68
trip 0 46 68
they 0 46 68
were 0 46 68
refused. 0 46 68

Greg 0 46 69
Burke, 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
pope’s 0 46 69
press 0 46 69
officer, 0 46 69
confirmed 0 46 69
that 0 46 69
“no 0 46 69
papal 0 46 69
meetings 0 46 69
were 0 46 69
planned 0 46 69
with 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
Osorno 0 46 69
group, 0 46 69
which 0 46 69
had 0 46 69
formally 0 46 69
requested 0 46 69
to 0 46 69
meet 0 46 69
with 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
pope 0 46 69
in 0 46 69
July 0 46 69
but 0 46 69
were 0 46 69
told 0 46 69
by 0 46 69
Vatican 0 46 69
organizers 0 46 69
that 0 46 69
his 0 46 69
schedule 0 46 69
was 0 46 69
already 0 46 69
final, 0 46 69
some 0 46 69
six 0 46 69
months 0 46 69
before 0 46 69
the 0 46 69
trip.” 0 46 69

Who 0 46 70
is 0 46 70
Barros? 0 46 70

Some 0 46 71
may 0 46 71
remember 0 46 71
a 0 46 71
video 0 46 71
that 0 46 71
made 0 46 71
the 0 46 71
internet 0 46 71
rounds 0 46 71
of 0 46 71
an 0 46 71
uproar 0 46 71
in 0 46 71
a 0 46 71
Chilean 0 46 71
cathedral 0 46 71
at 0 46 71
the 0 46 71
installation 0 46 71
ceremony 0 46 71
of 0 46 71
a 0 46 71
bishop. 0 46 71

At 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
time 0 46 72
it 0 46 72
didn’t 0 46 72
draw 0 46 72
much 0 46 72
attention 0 46 72
from 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
English 0 46 72
language 0 46 72
press 0 46 72
– 0 46 72
mostly 0 46 72
at 0 46 72
that 0 46 72
time 0 46 72
distracted 0 46 72
by 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
ongoing 0 46 72
battle 0 46 72
of 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
notorious 0 46 72
Kasper 0 46 72
Proposal 0 46 72
and 0 46 72
the 0 46 72
oncoming 0 46 72
Synods. 0 46 72

But 0 46 73
despite 0 46 73
the 0 46 73
pope’s 0 46 73
claim, 0 46 73
the 0 46 73
charges 0 46 73
against 0 46 73
Barros 0 46 73
are 0 46 73
serious 0 46 73
and 0 46 73
have 0 46 73
been 0 46 73
deemed 0 46 73
credible 0 46 73
by 0 46 73
a 0 46 73
judge. 0 46 73

He 0 46 74
is 0 46 74
accused 0 46 74
of 0 46 74
having 0 46 74
covered 0 46 74
up 0 46 74
sexual 0 46 74
abuse, 0 46 74
including 0 46 74
destroying 0 46 74
evidence, 0 46 74
committed 0 46 74
by 0 46 74
Karadima 0 46 74
in 0 46 74
the 0 46 74
‘80s 0 46 74
and 0 46 74
‘90s. 0 46 74

In 0 46 75
fact 0 46 75
– 0 46 75
and 0 46 75
this 0 46 75
point 0 46 75
has 0 46 75
tended 0 46 75
to 0 46 75
get 0 46 75
glossed 0 46 75
over 0 46 75
in 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
press 0 46 75
– 0 46 75
Barros 0 46 75
is 0 46 75
accused 0 46 75
by 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
victims 0 46 75
of 0 46 75
having 0 46 75
been 0 46 75
in 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
room, 0 46 75
watching 0 46 75
at 0 46 75
the 0 46 75
time, 0 46 75
and 0 46 75
of 0 46 75
engaging 0 46 75
in 0 46 75
sexual 0 46 75
activity 0 46 75
with 0 46 75
Karadima. 0 46 75

This 0 46 76
is 0 46 76
not, 0 46 76
therefore, 0 46 76
merely 0 46 76
a 0 46 76
matter 0 46 76
of 0 46 76
a 0 46 76
bishop 0 46 76
or 0 46 76
colleague 0 46 76
discovering 0 46 76
the 0 46 76
abuse 0 46 76
after 0 46 76
the 0 46 76
fact, 0 46 76
but 0 46 76
of 0 46 76
being 0 46 76
a 1 46 76
voyeuristic 1 46 76
participant. 1 46 76

Juan 0 46 77
Carlos 0 46 77
Cruz, 0 46 77
told 0 46 77
the 0 46 77
press 0 46 77
in 0 46 77
2015 0 46 77
that 0 46 77
he 0 46 77
and 0 46 77
another 0 46 77
boy 0 46 77
– 0 46 77
both 0 46 77
in 0 46 77
their 0 46 77
teens 0 46 77
at 0 46 77
the 0 46 77
time 0 46 77
– 0 46 77
“would 0 46 77
lie 0 46 77
down 0 46 77
on 0 46 77
the 0 46 77
priest’s 0 46 77
[Karadima’s] 0 46 77
bed, 0 46 77
one 0 46 77

another 0 46 77
sitting 0 46 77
near 0 46 77
his 0 46 77
feet. 0 46 77

The 0 46 78
priest 0 46 78
would 0 46 78
kiss 0 46 78
the 0 46 78
boys 0 46 78
and 0 46 78
grope 0 46 78
them, 0 46 78
he 0 46 78
said, 0 46 78
all 0 46 78
while 0 46 78
the 0 46 78
Rev. 0 46 78

Juan 0 46 79
Barros 0 46 79
watched.” 0 46 79
Cruz, 0 46 79
now 0 46 79
a 0 46 79
51-year-old 0 46 79
“gay” 0 46 79
journalist, 0 46 79
told 0 46 79
The 0 46 79
Associated 0 46 79
Press, 0 46 79
“Barros 0 46 79
was 0 46 79
there, 0 46 79
and 0 46 79
he 0 46 79
saw 0 46 79
it 0 46 79
all.” 0 46 79

A 0 46 80
Vatican 0 46 80
investigation 0 46 80
found 0 46 80
Karadima 0 46 80
guilty 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
2011 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
sentenced 0 46 80
him 0 46 80
to 0 46 80
a 0 46 80
life 0 46 80
of 0 46 80
seclusion 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
a 0 46 80
monastery 0 46 80
for 0 46 80
“penitence 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
prayer.” 0 46 80
Note 0 46 80
that 0 46 80
date; 0 46 80
2011 0 46 80
was 0 46 80
when 0 46 80
the 0 46 80
processes 0 46 80
for 0 46 80
investigating 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
trying 0 46 80
priest-abusers, 1 46 80
put 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
place 0 46 80

were 0 46 80
still 0 46 80
in 0 46 80
effect, 0 46 80
and 0 46 80
while 0 46 80
he 0 46 80
was 0 46 80
still 0 46 80
sitting 0 46 80
on 0 46 80
the 0 46 80
Petrine 0 46 80
throne. 0 46 80

Things 0 46 81
are 0 46 81
a 0 46 81
bit 0 46 81
different 0 46 81
now. 0 46 81

Neither 0 46 82
was 0 46 82
the 0 46 82
complaint 0 46 82
against 0 46 82
Barros 0 46 82
without 0 46 82
the 0 46 82
support 0 46 82
of 0 46 82
responsible 0 46 82
people. 0 46 82

The 0 46 83
media 0 46 83
reported 0 46 83
that 0 46 83
over 0 46 83
1,300 0 46 83
Catholic 0 46 83
faithful 0 46 83
in 0 46 83
Osorno, 0 46 83

30 0 46 83

asking 0 46 83
him 0 46 83
to 0 46 83
rescind 0 46 83
the 0 46 83
appointment 0 46 83

none 0 46 83
of 0 46 83
which 0 46 83

any 0 46 83

Fr. 0 46 84

Peter 0 46 85
Kleigel, 0 46 85
a 0 46 85
priest 0 46 85
of 0 46 85
Osorno, 0 46 85
told 0 46 85
Associated 0 46 85
Press, 0 46 85
“We’re 0 46 85
convinced 0 46 85
that 0 46 85
this 0 46 85
appointment 0 46 85
is 0 46 85
not 0 46 85
correct 0 46 85
because, 0 46 85
following 0 46 85
canon 0 46 85
law, 0 46 85
a 0 46 85
bishop 0 46 85
must 0 46 85
be 0 46 85
well-regarded. 0 46 85

We 0 46 86
need 0 46 86
a 0 46 86
bishop 0 46 86
who’s 0 46 86
credible.” 0 46 86

The 0 46 87
problem 0 46 87
with 0 46 87
getting 0 46 87
the 0 46 87
news 0 46 87
out 0 46 87
about 0 46 87
Karadima, 0 46 87
as 0 46 87
in 0 46 87
most 0 46 87
of 0 46 87
these 0 46 87
cases, 0 46 87
was 0 46 87
the 0 46 87
bishop, 0 46 87
in 0 46 87
this 0 46 87
case 0 46 87
Cardinal 0 46 87
Francisco 0 46 87
Javier 0 46 87
Errázuriz 0 46 87
of 0 46 87

who 0 46 87
after 0 46 87
the 0 46 87
Conclave 0 46 87
of 0 46 87
2013 0 46 87
was 0 46 87

Pope 0 46 87
Francis’s 0 46 87
C9 0 46 87
inner 0 46 87

It 0 46 88
was 0 46 88
certainly 0 46 88
never 0 46 88
a 0 46 88
secret 0 46 88
that 0 46 88
Errázuriz 0 46 88

a 0 46 88
close, 0 46 88
like-minded 0 46 88

Allegations 0 46 89
against 0 46 89
Karadima 0 46 89
– 0 46 89
that 0 46 89
went 0 46 89
back 0 46 89
to 0 46 89
1962 0 46 89
– 0 46 89
had 0 46 89
certainly 0 46 89
been 0 46 89
reported 0 46 89
to 0 46 89
Church 0 46 89
authorities 0 46 89
well 0 46 89
before 0 46 89
a 0 46 89
Chilean 0 46 89

revealed 0 46 89

but 0 46 89
were 0 46 89
ignored 0 46 89

Even 0 46 90

between 0 46 90
the 0 46 90
new 0 46 90

and 0 46 90
the 0 46 90
accused 0 46 90
cardinals, 0 46 90

“Hamilton 0 46 91
had 0 46 91
applied 0 46 91
for 0 46 91
a 0 46 91
marriage 0 46 91
annulment, 0 46 91
after 0 46 91
telling 0 46 91
his 0 46 91
wife 0 46 91
of 0 46 91
a 0 46 91
long 0 46 91
psychosexual 0 46 91
entanglement 0 46 91
with 0 46 91
Karadima 0 46 91
that 0 46 91
began 0 46 91
when 0 46 91
he 0 46 91
was 0 46 91

in 0 46 91
El 0 46 91

His 0 46 92
wife 0 46 92
confided 0 46 92
in 0 46 92
a 0 46 92
priest, 0 46 92
who 0 46 92
told 0 46 92
Errázuriz 0 46 92
in 0 46 92
2006. 0 46 92

When 0 46 93
a 0 46 93
canon 0 46 93
lawyer 0 46 93
and 0 46 93
several 0 46 93
priests 0 46 93
close 0 46 93
to 0 46 93
the 0 46 93
cardinal 0 46 93
suggested 0 46 93
that 0 46 93
Hamilton 0 46 93
not 0 46 93
mention 0 46 93
Karadima, 0 46 93
he 0 46 93
pressed 0 46 93
on 0 46 93
with 0 46 93
his 0 46 93
request 0 46 93

having 0 46 93
his 0 46 93
marriage 0 46 93
annulled. 0 46 93

Again, 0 46 94
Errázuriz 0 46 94
refused 0 46 94
to 0 46 94
take 0 46 94
action 0 46 94
against 0 46 94
Karadima.” 0 46 94

The 0 46 95

that 0 46 95

is 0 46 95
“no 0 46 95

of 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
ruling 0 46 95
of 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
civil 0 46 95
judge 0 46 95
in 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
Karadima 0 46 95
case 0 46 95
– 0 46 95
a 0 46 95
fact 0 46 95
that 0 46 95
ought 0 46 95
to 0 46 95
be 0 46 95
of 0 46 95
paramount 0 46 95
consideration 0 46 95
under 0 46 95
the 0 46 95
Vatican’s 0 46 95

While 0 46 96
Judge 0 46 96
Jessica 0 46 96
Gonzalez 0 46 96
was 0 46 96
forced 0 46 96
to 0 46 96
drop 0 46 96
criminal 0 46 96
charges 0 46 96
because 0 46 96
the 0 46 96

After 0 46 97
a 0 46 97
full 0 46 97
year 0 46 97
of 0 46 97
investigation, 0 46 97

called 0 46 97

destroyed 0 46 98
by 0 46 98
Barros, 0 46 98
who 0 46 98
was 0 46 98
serving 0 46 98
at 0 46 98
the 0 46 98

general 0 46 99
credibility 0 46 99
as 0 46 99

In 0 46 100
a 0 46 100
letter 0 46 100
to 0 46 100
Bishop 0 46 100
Ivo 0 46 100
Scapolo, 0 46 100
papal 0 46 100

that 0 46 100
Cruz 0 46 100
gave 0 46 100
to 0 46 100
the 0 46 100
Associated 0 46 100
Press, 0 46 100
he 0 46 100
said 0 46 100
he 0 46 100
witnessed 0 46 100
Karadima 0 46 100
and 0 46 100
Barros 0 46 100
in 0 46 100
an 0 46 100
intimate 0 46 100
relationship. 0 46 100

“I 0 46 101
saw 0 46 101
Karadima 0 46 101
and 0 46 101
Juan 0 46 101
Barros 0 46 101
kissing 0 46 101
and 0 46 101
touching 0 46 101
each 0 46 101
other. 0 46 101

The 0 46 102
groping 0 46 102
generally 0 46 102
came 0 46 102
from 0 46 102
Karadima 0 46 102
touching 0 46 102
Barros’ 0 46 102
genitals”. 0 46 102

Barros 0 46 103
has 0 46 103
never 0 46 103
denied 0 46 103
having 0 46 103
had 0 46 103
a 0 46 103
close 0 46 103
friendship 0 46 103
with 0 46 103
Karadima. 0 46 103

Hamilton 0 46 104
confirmed 0 46 104
this 0 46 104
saying, 0 46 104
“I 0 46 104
saw 0 46 104
how 0 46 104
Barros 0 46 104
watched 0 46 104
it 0 46 104
all.” 0 46 104

And 0 46 105
the 0 46 105
matter 0 46 105
didn’t 0 46 105
end 0 46 105
in 0 46 105
2010. 0 46 105

Emails 0 46 106

in 0 46 106
Chile 0 46 106
in 0 46 106
2015 0 46 106
showed 0 46 106
that 0 46 106
Cardinal 0 46 106
Errázuriz 0 46 106
also 0 46 106
blocked 0 46 106
the 0 46 106

of 0 46 106

Carlos 0 46 106

– 0 46 106
a 0 46 106
group 0 46 106
plagued 1 46 106
by 0 46 106
such 0 46 106
scandals 0 46 106
and 0 46 106
eventually 0 46 106
ignored 1 46 106
to 1 46 106
death 1 46 106
by 0 46 106
Francis. 0 46 106

Which 0 46 107
brings 0 46 107
us 0 46 107
to 0 46 107
Francis 0 46 107
Bergoglio’s 0 46 107
own 0 46 107
record 0 46 107
in 0 46 107
this 0 46 107
area. 0 46 107

The 0 46 108
pope 0 46 108
claimed 0 46 108
“I 0 46 108
am 0 46 108
the 0 46 108
first 0 46 108
to 0 46 108
judge 0 46 108
and 0 46 108
punish 0 46 108
those 0 46 108
accused 0 46 108
of 0 46 108
similar 0 46 108
crimes,” 0 46 108
but 0 46 108
this 0 46 108
claim 0 46 108
is 0 46 108
not 0 46 108
supported 0 46 108
by 0 46 108
the 0 46 108
reality. 0 46 108

Indeed, 0 46 109
it 0 46 109
has 0 46 109
been 0 46 109
pointed 0 46 109
out 0 46 109
that 0 46 109
Francis 0 46 109
has 0 46 109
gone 0 46 109
to 0 46 109
considerable 0 46 109
lengths 0 46 109
to 0 46 109
dismantle 0 46 109
the 0 46 109
efforts 0 46 109
of 0 46 109
his 0 46 109
predecessor 0 46 109
at 0 46 109
“safeguarding” 0 46 109
young 0 46 109
people, 0 46 109
punishing 0 46 109
abusers 0 46 109
and 0 46 109
removing 0 46 109
bishops 0 46 109
who 0 46 109
cover 0 46 109
it 0 46 109
up. 0 46 109

In 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
case 0 46 110
of 0 46 110
Barros, 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
Associated 0 46 110
Press 0 46 110
obtained 0 46 110
a 0 46 110

Pope 0 46 110

Just 0 46 110
days 0 46 110
before 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
pope’s 0 46 110
“calumny” 0 46 110
comment, 0 46 110
January 0 46 110
11, 0 46 110
AP 0 46 110
reported 0 46 110
that 0 46 110
Francis 0 46 110
had 0 46 110
full 0 46 110
knowledge 0 46 110
of 0 46 110
the 0 46 110
controversy 0 46 110
he 0 46 110
risked 0 46 110
in 0 46 110
appointing 0 46 110
Barros 0 46 110
to 0 46 110
Osorno. 0 46 110

“[H]is 0 46 111
ambassador 0 46 111

Chile 0 46 111
had 0 46 111

to 0 46 111
find 0 46 111
a 0 46 111
way 0 46 111
to 0 46 111
contain 0 46 111
the 0 46 111
damage 0 46 111
well 0 46 111
before 0 46 111
the 0 46 111
case 0 46 111
made 0 46 111
headlines.” 0 46 111

The 0 46 112
letter, 0 46 112
addressed 0 46 112
to 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
executive 0 46 112
committee 0 46 112
of 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
Chilean 0 46 112
bishops’ 0 46 112
conference, 0 46 112
said, 0 46 112
“Thank 0 46 112
you 0 46 112
for 0 46 112
having 0 46 112
openly 0 46 112
demonstrated 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
concern 0 46 112
that 0 46 112
you 0 46 112
have 0 46 112
about 0 46 112
the 0 46 112
appointment 0 46 112
of 0 46 112
Monsignor 0 46 112
Juan 0 46 112
Barros. 0 46 112

I 0 46 113
understand 0 46 113
what 0 46 113
you’re 0 46 113
telling 0 46 113
me 0 46 113
and 0 46 113
I’m 0 46 113
aware 0 46 113
that 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
situation 0 46 113
of 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
church 0 46 113
in 0 46 113
Chile 0 46 113
is 0 46 113
difficult 0 46 113
due 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
trials 0 46 113
you’ve 0 46 113
had 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
undergo.” 0 46 113
The 0 46 113
letter 0 46 113
said 0 46 113
that 0 46 113
in 0 46 113
2014 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
nuncio, 0 46 113
Archbishop 0 46 113
Scapolo, 0 46 113
had 0 46 113
asked 0 46 113
Barros 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
resign 0 46 113
as 0 46 113
bishop 0 46 113
of 0 46 113
the 0 46 113
armed 0 46 113
forces 0 46 113
and 0 46 113
had 0 46 113
“encouraged 0 46 113
him 0 46 113
to 0 46 113
take 0 46 113
a 0 46 113
sabbatical 0 46 113
year 0 46 113
before 0 46 113
assuming 0 46 113
any 0 46 113
other 0 46 113
pastoral 0 46 113
responsibility 0 46 113
as 0 46 113
a 0 46 113
bishop.” 0 46 113

There 0 46 114
can 0 46 114
also 0 46 114
be 0 46 114
little 0 46 114
doubt 0 46 114
the 0 46 114
new 0 46 114
pope 0 46 114
was 0 46 114
fully 0 46 114
aware 0 46 114
of 0 46 114
the 0 46 114
record 0 46 114
of 0 46 114
his 0 46 114
close 0 46 114
friend 0 46 114
Cardinal 0 46 114
Errázuriz 0 46 114
in 0 46 114
ignoring 0 46 114
complaints 0 46 114
of 0 46 114
Karadima’s 0 46 114
victims 0 46 114
when 0 46 114
he 0 46 114
appointed 0 46 114
him 0 46 114
to 0 46 114
the 0 46 114
C9 0 46 114
council. 0 46 114

And 0 46 115
even 0 46 115
if 0 46 115
he 0 46 115
didn’t 0 46 115
then, 0 46 115
he 0 46 115
certainly 0 46 115
knows 0 46 115
now, 0 46 115
and 0 46 115
yet 0 46 115
Errazuriz 0 46 115
continues 0 46 115
in 0 46 115
that 0 46 115
advisory 0 46 115
role. 0 46 115

Francis 0 46 116
further 0 46 116
appointed 0 46 116
Cardinal 0 46 116
Errázuriz 0 46 116
to 0 46 116

completely 0 46 117
dismantled 0 46 117
or 0 46 117
reversed 0 46 117
those 0 46 117
changes. 0 46 117

Among 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
earliest 0 46 118
indications 0 46 118
Catholics 0 46 118
had 0 46 118
that 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
new 0 46 118
pope 0 46 118
had 0 46 118
no 0 46 118
intention 0 46 118
of 0 46 118
getting 0 46 118
to 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
bottom 0 46 118
of 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
priest-abuser 0 46 118
problem 0 46 118
was 0 46 118
his 0 46 118
appointment 0 46 118
of 0 46 118
the 1 46 118
notorious 1 46 118
homosexual, 1 46 118
Monsignor 0 46 118
Battista 0 46 118
Ricca, 0 46 118
as 0 46 118
head 0 46 118
of 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
Vatican 0 46 118
Bank 0 46 118
and 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
man 0 46 118
in 0 46 118
charge 0 46 118
of 0 46 118
his 0 46 118
own 0 46 118
residence, 0 46 118
the 0 46 118
Casa 0 46 118
Santa 0 46 118
Martha. 0 46 118

It 0 46 119
is 0 46 119
often 0 46 119
forgotten 0 46 119
that 0 46 119
Bergoglio’s 0 46 119
notorious 0 46 119
comment 0 46 119
“who 1 46 119
am 1 46 119
I 1 46 119
to 1 46 119
judge” 1 46 119
was 0 46 119
in 0 46 119
response 0 46 119
to 0 46 119
a 0 46 119
question 0 46 119
on 0 46 119
a 0 46 119
plane-presser 0 46 119
about 0 46 119
Ricca, 0 46 119
and 0 46 119
was 0 46 119
followed 0 46 119
with 0 46 119
a 0 46 119
similar 0 46 119
claim 0 46 119
from 0 46 119
Francis 0 46 119
about 0 46 119
there 0 46 119
having 0 46 119
been 0 46 119
no 0 46 119
proof 0 46 119
of 0 46 119
his 0 46 119
misbehaviour. 0 46 119

As 0 46 120
the 0 46 120
pseudonymous 0 46 120
Marcantonio 0 46 120
Colonna 0 46 120
wrote 0 46 120
in 0 46 120
the 0 46 120
book, 0 46 120
“The 0 46 120
Dictator 0 46 120
Pope,” 0 46 120
“In 0 46 120
fact 0 46 120
his 0 46 120
patronage 0 46 120
of 0 46 120
Monsignor 0 46 120
Ricca 0 46 120
fits 0 46 120
the 0 46 120
pattern 0 46 120
which 0 46 120
was 0 46 120
well 0 46 120
established 0 46 120
when 0 46 120
he 0 46 120
was 0 46 120
Archbishop 0 46 120
of 0 46 120
Buenos 0 46 120
Aires, 0 46 120
whereby 0 46 120
he 0 46 120
surrounds 0 46 120
himself 0 46 120
with 0 46 120
morally 0 46 120
weak 0 46 120
people 0 46 120
so 0 46 120
as 0 46 120
to 0 46 120
have 0 46 120
them 0 46 120
under 1 46 120
his 1 46 120
thumb.” 1 46 120

But 0 46 121
even 0 46 121
before 0 46 121
this 0 46 121
was 0 46 121
the 1 46 121
sinister 1 46 121
appearance 1 46 121
of 0 46 121
Godfried 0 46 121
Cardinal 0 46 121

of 0 46 123
the 0 46 123

Group, 0 46 123
which 0 46 123
he 0 46 123
himself 0 46 123
described 0 46 123
as 0 46 123
a 0 46 123
“mafia,” 1 46 123
who 0 46 123
had 0 46 123
worked 0 46 123
against 0 46 123

elect 0 46 123
Bergoglio 0 46 123
in 0 46 123
2013. 0 46 123

At 0 46 124
the 0 46 124
end 0 46 124
of 0 46 124
a 0 46 124
long 0 46 124
career 0 46 124
as 0 46 124
Europe’s 0 46 124
leading 0 46 124
“liberal” 0 46 124
Catholic 0 46 124
prelate, 0 46 124
Danneels 0 46 124
came 0 46 124
under 0 46 124
a 0 46 124
cloud 0 46 124
of 0 46 124
scandal 0 46 124
when 0 46 124
he 0 46 124
was 0 46 124
accused 0 46 124
of 0 46 124
having 0 46 124
covered 0 46 124
for 0 46 124
a 0 46 124
protégé 0 46 124
bishop 0 46 124
who 0 46 124
admitted 0 46 124
to 0 46 124
having 0 46 124
sexually 0 46 124
abused 0 46 124
his 0 46 124
own 0 46 124
minor 0 46 124
nephew. 0 46 124

In 0 46 125
2010 0 46 125
the 0 46 125
publication 0 46 125
of 0 46 125
an 0 46 125
audio 0 46 125
recording 0 46 125
determined 0 46 125
undeniably 0 46 125
that 0 46 125
Danneels 0 46 125
had 0 46 125
told 0 46 125
the 0 46 125
victim 0 46 125
to 0 46 125
keep 0 46 125
quiet 0 46 125
and 0 46 125
not 0 46 125
cause 0 46 125
trouble 0 46 125
for 0 46 125
the 0 46 125
soon-to-retire 0 46 125
Bishop 0 46 125
Roger 0 46 125
Vangheluwe 0 46 125
of 0 46 125
Bruges. 0 46 125

The 0 46 126
cardinal 0 46 126
even 0 46 126
went 0 46 126
so 0 46 126
far 0 46 126
as 0 46 126
to 0 46 126
suggest 0 46 126
that 0 46 126
the 0 46 126
victim 0 46 126
should 0 46 126
“ask 0 46 126
forgiveness” 0 46 126
for 0 46 126
his 0 46 126
own 0 46 126
role 0 46 126
in 0 46 126
the 0 46 126
scandal. 0 46 126

Before 0 46 127
the 0 46 127
recordings 0 46 127
were 0 46 127
released, 0 46 127
Danneels 0 46 127
had 0 46 127
also 0 46 127
denied 0 46 127
all 0 46 127
knowledge 0 46 127
of 0 46 127
sexual 0 46 127
abuse 0 46 127
by 0 46 127
clergy 0 46 127
or 0 46 127
cover-ups. 0 46 127

In 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
book, 0 46 128
Colonna 0 46 128
asks 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
question, 0 46 128
“What 1 46 128
happened 1 46 128
to 1 46 128
‘Zero 1 46 128
Tolerance’ 1 46 128
for 1 46 128
clerical 1 46 128
sexual 1 46 128
offenders?” 1 46 128
He 0 46 128
wrote 0 46 128
that 0 46 128
data 0 46 128
presented 0 46 128
by 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
Vatican 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
UN 0 46 128
Human 0 46 128
Rights 0 46 128
Commission 0 46 128
in 0 46 128
January 0 46 128
2014 0 46 128
showed 0 46 128
that 0 46 128
Benedict 0 46 128
XVI 0 46 128
“had 0 46 128
defrocked 0 46 128
or 0 46 128
suspended 0 46 128
more 0 46 128

800 0 46 128
priests 0 46 128
for 0 46 128
past 0 46 128
sexual 0 46 128
abuse 0 46 128
between 0 46 128
2009 0 46 128
and 0 46 128
2012,” 0 46 128
including 0 46 128
the 0 46 128
notorious 0 46 128
Fr. 0 46 128

Maciel 0 46 129
Degollado, 0 46 129
founder 0 46 129
of 0 46 129
the 0 46 129
Legionaries 0 46 129
of 0 46 129
Christ. 0 46 129

Crucially, 0 46 130
it 0 46 130
was 0 46 130
Ratzinger 0 46 130
who 0 46 130
moved 0 46 130
the 0 46 130
competence 0 46 130
for 0 46 130
sex 0 46 130
abuse 0 46 130
cases 0 46 130
from 0 46 130
the 0 46 130
Congregation 0 46 130
for 0 46 130
Bishops 0 46 130
to 0 46 130
Doctrine 0 46 130
of 0 46 130
the 0 46 130
Faith, 0 46 130
with 0 46 130
powers 0 46 130
to 0 46 130
suspend 0 46 130
and 0 46 130
punish 0 46 130
offenders. 0 46 130

His 0 46 131
reforms 0 46 131
specifically 0 46 131
included 0 46 131
bishops 0 46 131
who 0 46 131
had 0 46 131
refused 0 46 131
to 0 46 131
act 0 46 131
against 0 46 131
priest-abusers. 0 46 131

A 0 46 132
senior 0 46 132
member 0 46 132
of 0 46 132
the 0 46 132
Vatican’s 0 46 132
diplomatic 0 46 132
corps, 0 46 132
Archbishop 0 46 132
Miguel 0 46 132
Maury 0 46 132
Buendia, 0 46 132
confirmed 0 46 132
this, 0 46 132
saying, 0 46 132
“This 0 46 132
Pope 0 46 132
has 0 46 132
removed 0 46 132
two 0 46 132
or 0 46 132
three 0 46 132
bishops 0 46 132
per 0 46 132
month 0 46 132
throughout 0 46 132
the 0 46 132
world... 0 46 132

There 0 46 133
have 0 46 133
been 0 46 133
two 0 46 133
or 0 46 133
three 0 46 133
instances 0 46 133
in 0 46 133
which 0 46 133
they 0 46 133
said 0 46 133
no, 0 46 133
and 0 46 133
so 0 46 133
the 0 46 133
Pope 0 46 133
simply 0 46 133
removed 0 46 133
them.” 0 46 133

These 0 46 134
reforms 0 46 134
– 0 46 134
and 0 46 134
removals 0 46 134
– 0 46 134
have 0 46 134
ceased 0 46 134
entirely 0 46 134
under 0 46 134
Francis. 0 46 134

Despite 0 46 135
his 0 46 135
claims 0 46 135
that 0 46 135
he 0 46 135
punishes 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
guilty, 0 46 135
it 0 46 135
was 0 46 135
in 0 46 135
fact 0 46 135
Francis 0 46 135
who 0 46 135
reversed 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
previous, 0 46 135
Benedict-era 0 46 135
sentence 0 46 135
against 0 46 135
the 1 46 135
notorious 1 46 135
Italian 1 46 135
priest-pederast 1 46 135
Mario 0 46 135
Inzoli 0 46 135
at 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
request 0 46 135
of 0 46 135
the 0 46 135
now-equally 0 46 135
notorious 0 46 135
Cardinal 0 46 135
Coccopalmerio. 0 46 135

Inzoli 0 46 136
was 0 46 136
found 0 46 136
guilty 0 46 136
in 0 46 136
2012 0 46 136
by 0 46 136
an 0 46 136
ecclesiastical 0 46 136
court 0 46 136
of 0 46 136
abusing 0 46 136
boys 0 46 136
as 0 46 136
young 0 46 136
as 0 46 136
twelve 0 46 136
and 0 46 136
suspended. 0 46 136

Inzoli 0 46 137
had 0 46 137
even 0 46 137
abused 0 46 137
boys 0 46 137
in 0 46 137
the 0 46 137
confessional, 0 46 137
convincing 0 46 137
them 0 46 137
that 0 46 137
the 1 46 137
abuse 1 46 137
was 1 46 137
approved 1 46 137
by 1 46 137
God. 1 46 137

Following 0 46 138
an 0 46 138
appeal 0 46 138
by 0 46 138
Coccopalmerio, 0 46 138
Francis 0 46 138
reduced 0 46 138
the 0 46 138
priest’s 0 46 138
penalty 0 46 138
to 0 46 138
a 0 46 138
“lifetime 0 46 138
of 0 46 138
prayer,” 0 46 138
with 0 46 138
permission 0 46 138
to 0 46 138
say 0 46 138
Mass 0 46 138
privately, 0 46 138
and 0 46 138
a 0 46 138
promise 0 46 138
to 0 46 138
stay 0 46 138
away 0 46 138
from 0 46 138
children. 0 46 138

The 0 46 139
uproar 0 46 139
over 0 46 139
this 0 46 139
caused 0 46 139
the 0 46 139
Italian 0 46 139
prosecutors 0 46 139
to 0 46 139
reopen 0 46 139
the 0 46 139
case 0 46 139
against 0 46 139
the 0 46 139
priest, 0 46 139
and 0 46 139
eventually 0 46 139
Inzoli 0 46 139
went 0 46 139
to 0 46 139
prison 0 46 139
and 0 46 139
was 0 46 139
laicized. 0 46 139

As 0 46 140
for 0 46 140
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0 46 140
procedural 0 46 140
reforms, 0 46 140
rumours 0 46 140
continue 0 46 140
to 0 46 140
circulate 0 46 140
that 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
pope 0 46 140
intends 0 46 140
to 0 46 140
reverse 0 46 140
them 0 46 140
as 0 46 140
well, 0 46 140
placing 0 46 140
competence 0 46 140
back 0 46 140
into 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
hands 0 46 140
of 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
same 0 46 140
dicastery 0 46 140
that 0 46 140
held 0 46 140
it 0 46 140
when 0 46 140
the 0 46 140
scandals 0 46 140
broke 0 46 140
in 0 46 140
2001. 0 46 140

This 0 46 141
has 0 46 141
been 0 46 141
denied 0 46 141
by 0 46 141
Greg 0 46 141
Burke, 0 46 141
but 0 46 141
given 1 46 141
Francis’s 1 46 141
usual 1 46 141
methods, 1 46 141
it’s 1 46 141
anyone’s 1 46 141
guess 1 46 141
who 1 46 141
in 1 46 141
reality 1 46 141
is 1 46 141
actually 1 46 141
dealing 1 46 141
with 1 46 141
these 1 46 141
cases, 1 46 141
if 1 46 141
anyone. 1 46 141

A 0 46 142
tribunal 0 46 142
of 0 46 142
bishops, 0 46 142
requested 0 46 142
by 0 46 142
his 0 46 142
own 0 46 142
sex 0 46 142
abuse 0 46 142
commission, 0 46 142
was 0 46 142
ignored 0 46 142
and 0 46 142
then 0 46 142
Francis 0 46 142
summarily 0 46 142
removed 0 46 142
two 0 46 142
of 0 46 142
the 0 46 142
CDF 0 46 142
staffers 0 46 142
in 0 46 142
charge 0 46 142
of 0 46 142
handling 0 46 142
such 0 46 142
cases, 0 46 142
famously 0 46 142
refusing 0 46 142
to 0 46 142
give 0 46 142
any 0 46 142
reasons 0 46 142
to 0 46 142
CDF 0 46 142
prefect 0 46 142
Cardinal 0 46 142

who 0 46 142
was 0 46 142
soon 0 46 142
to 0 46 142
be 0 46 142
dismissed. 0 46 142

In 0 46 143
fact, 0 46 143
the 0 46 143
chaos 0 46 143
and 0 46 143
lack 0 46 143
of 0 46 143
commitment 0 46 143
on 0 46 143
the 0 46 143
issue 0 46 143
has 0 46 143
come 0 46 143
under 0 46 143
harsh 1 46 143
criticism 1 46 143
from 0 46 143
at 0 46 143
least 0 46 143
one 0 46 143

a 1 46 143
loudly 1 46 143
trumpeted 1 46 143
part 1 46 143
of 0 46 143
Bergoglio’s 0 46 143
early 0 46 143

of 0 46 143

She 0 46 145
resigned 0 46 145

started 0 47 8
after 0 47 8
the 0 47 8

the 0 55 3

being 0 55 3

during 0 55 3
the 0 55 3
Obama 0 55 3
reign. 0 55 3

In 0 55 4
2013, 0 55 4
Obama 0 55 4
began 0 55 4
bringing 0 55 4
into 0 55 4

literally 0 55 4
over 0 55 4
a 0 55 4

thousand 0 55 4
people, 0 55 4
mainly 0 55 4
below 0 55 4
age 0 55 4
21. 0 55 4

They 0 55 5
were 0 55 5

The 0 55 17
surge 0 55 17
of 0 55 17
children 0 55 17
into 0 55 17
the 0 55 17
US 0 55 17
from 0 55 17

countries 0 55 17
south 0 55 17
of 0 55 17
the 0 55 17
border 0 55 17
was 0 55 17
said 0 55 17
to 0 55 17
be 0 55 17
the 0 55 17
result 0 55 17
of 0 55 17
economics, 0 55 17
high 0 55 17
crime 0 55 17

and 0 55 17
actual 0 55 17
threats 0 55 17
from 0 55 17
organized 0 55 17
crime 0 55 17
entities. 0 55 17

Another 0 55 18
excuse 1 55 18
used 0 55 18
by 0 55 18
the 0 55 18
Obama 0 55 18
government 0 55 18
was 0 55 18
to 0 55 18
bring 0 55 18
them 0 55 18
here 0 55 18
to 0 55 18
find 0 55 18
their 0 55 18
families 0 55 18
already 0 55 18
in 0 55 18
the 0 55 18
US. 0 55 18

Thus, 0 55 19
the 0 55 19
idea 0 55 19
that 0 55 19
separating 1 55 19
children 0 55 19
from 0 55 19
their 0 55 19
parents 0 55 19
as 0 55 19
being 0 55 19
something 0 55 19
new, 0 55 19
done 0 55 19
only 0 55 19
by 0 55 19
the 0 55 19
Trump 0 55 19
Administration 0 55 19
is 0 55 19
absurd, 1 55 19
since 0 55 19
we 0 55 19
really 0 55 19
have 0 55 19
no 0 55 19
idea 0 55 19
whether 0 55 19
the 0 55 19
children 0 55 19
brought 0 55 19
here 0 55 19
during 0 55 19
the 0 55 19
Obama 0 55 19
reign 0 55 19
were 0 55 19
intentionally 0 55 19
separated 1 55 19
from 0 55 19
their 0 55 19
parents 0 55 19
by 0 55 19
the 0 55 19
US 0 55 19
government 0 55 19
at 0 55 19
that 0 55 19
time, 0 55 19
or 0 55 19
not. 0 55 19

We 0 55 20
have 0 55 20
only 0 55 20
what 0 55 20
little 0 55 20
information 0 55 20
the 0 55 20
government 0 55 20
told 0 55 20
us 0 55 20
then, 0 55 20
which 0 55 20
was 0 55 20
not 0 55 20
very 0 55 20
much, 0 55 20
considering 0 55 20
the 0 55 20
fact 0 55 20
that 0 55 20
Obama 0 55 20
wanted 0 55 20
to 0 55 20
keep 0 55 20
as 0 55 20
much 0 55 20
of 0 55 20
this 0 55 20
situation 0 55 20
as 0 55 20
secret 0 55 20
as 0 55 20
possible. 0 55 20

What 0 55 21
many 0 55 21
do 0 55 21
not 0 55 21
realize 0 55 21
is, 0 55 21
today's 0 55 21
policy 0 55 21
of 0 55 21
separating 1 55 21
underage 0 55 21
siblings 0 55 21
from 0 55 21
their 0 55 21
parents 0 55 21
once 0 55 21
they 0 55 21
cross 0 55 21
the 0 55 21
border 0 55 21
illegally 0 55 21
into 0 55 21
the 0 55 21

to 0 55 21
be 0 55 21

planned 0 55 21

going 0 55 21
all 0 55 21
the 0 55 21
way 0 55 21
back 0 55 21
to 0 55 21
the 0 55 21
domestic 0 55 21

exercises 0 55 21

as 0 55 21
Jade 0 55 21
Helm 0 55 21
in 0 55 21

Many 0 55 22
remember 0 55 22
the 0 55 22
military 0 55 22
taking 0 55 22
over 0 55 22
several 0 55 22
Walmart 0 55 22
locations, 0 55 22
mainly 0 55 22

during 0 55 22
the 0 55 22
Jade 0 55 22
Helm 0 55 22
exercises. 0 55 22

This, 0 55 23
along 0 55 23
with 0 55 23
the 0 55 23
federal 0 55 23
government 0 55 23
grab 0 55 23
of 0 55 23

of 0 55 23

speaks 0 55 23
volumes 0 55 23
in 0 55 23

the 0 55 28

today 0 55 28
is 0 55 28
some 1 55 28
very 1 55 28
good 1 55 28
actors 1 55 28
on 1 55 28
the 1 55 28
Left 1 55 28
accusing 0 55 28
the 0 55 28

of 0 55 28
being 0 55 28

When 0 55 29
in 0 55 29
fact, 0 55 29
their 0 55 29
idol, 1 55 29
Obama 0 55 29
did 0 55 29
the 0 55 29

they 0 55 30

not 0 55 30

on 0 55 31
the 0 55 31

following 0 55 31
along 0 55 31

it 0 55 31
by 0 55 31
detaining 0 55 31

from 0 55 31
their 0 55 31
apparent 0 55 31
families. 0 55 31

Since 0 55 32
no 0 55 32
one 0 55 32
can 0 55 32
know 0 55 32
if 0 55 32
the 0 55 32
children 0 55 32
really 0 55 32
belong 0 55 32

they 0 55 32
are 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
parents, 0 55 32
they 0 55 32
are 0 55 32
separated 1 55 32
until 0 55 32
that 0 55 32
can 0 55 32

and 0 55 33
the 0 55 33

All 0 55 34
of 0 55 34
which 0 55 34
seems 0 55 34
to 0 55 34
be 0 55 34
a 0 55 34
planned 0 55 34
event. 0 55 34

In 0 55 35
any 0 55 35
case, 0 55 35
neither 0 55 35
side 0 55 35
in 0 55 35
DC 0 55 35
is 0 55 35

about 0 55 35
the 0 55 35

involved. 0 55 35

If 0 55 36
they 0 55 36
were, 0 55 36
there 0 55 36
would 0 55 36
be 0 55 36
no 0 55 36

Why 0 56 0
the 0 56 0

Yesterday, 0 56 1
the 0 56 1
alternative 0 56 1
media 0 56 1
purge 0 56 1
was 0 56 1
boldly 1 56 1
advanced 0 56 1
in 0 56 1
a 0 56 1

effort 0 56 1
to 0 56 1

people 0 56 1
who 0 56 1
dissent 0 56 1
from 0 56 1
establishment 0 56 1
views. 0 56 1

It’s 0 56 2
just 0 56 2
one 0 56 2
more 0 56 2
step 0 56 2
toward 0 56 2
a 0 56 2
monopoly 0 56 2
on 0 56 2
information 0 56 2
by 0 56 2
those 1 56 2
who 1 56 2
hate 1 56 2
freedom. 1 56 2

At 0 56 3
this 0 56 3
rate, 0 56 3
they’ll 0 56 3
soon 0 56 3
have 0 56 3
unquestioned 0 56 3

2 0 56 3

people. 0 56 3

And 0 56 4
this 1 56 4
should 1 56 4
terrify 1 56 4
everyone 1 56 4
who 1 56 4
wants 1 56 4
to 1 56 4

But 0 56 39
of 0 56 39
course, 0 56 39
since 0 56 39
they 0 56 39
too 0 56 39
push 0 56 39

(waaah, 0 56 39

as 0 56 40
do 0 56 40
all 0 56 40
the 0 56 40

The 0 56 41
fact 0 56 41
that 0 56 41
many 0 56 41
of 0 56 41
these 0 56 41

also 0 56 41
suspended 0 56 41
by 0 56 41

shortly 0 56 41
thereafter 0 56 41
should 0 56 41
tell 0 56 41
you 0 56 41
that 0 56 41
this 1 56 41
is 1 56 41
a 1 56 41
coordinated 1 56 41
effort 1 56 41
to 1 56 41
silence 1 56 41
large 1 56 41
swaths 1 56 41
of 1 56 41
the 1 56 41
population. 1 56 41

Of 0 56 42
course, 0 56 42
the 0 56 42
best 0 56 42
coverage 0 56 42
of 0 56 42
this 0 56 42
is 0 56 42
from…Russia. 0 56 42

Sputnik 0 56 43
News 0 56 43
contacted 0 56 43
many 0 56 43
of 0 56 43
the 0 56 43
alternative 0 56 43
journalists 0 56 43
who 0 56 43
were 0 56 43
purged 0 56 43
to 0 56 43
get 0 56 43
their 0 56 43
take 0 56 43
on 0 56 43
what 0 56 43
happened. 0 56 43

You 0 56 44
may 0 56 44
recall 0 56 44
that 0 56 44
basically 0 56 44
every 0 56 44
blogger 0 56 44
outside 0 56 44
the 0 56 44
establishment 0 56 44
media 0 56 44
was 0 56 44
accused 0 56 44
of 0 56 44
being 0 56 44
secretly 0 56 44
Russian 0 56 44
during 0 56 44
the 0 56 44
2016 0 56 44
election 0 56 44
by 0 56 44
the 0 56 44
Washington 0 56 44
Post, 0 56 44
so 0 56 44
perhaps 0 56 44
actual 0 56 44
Russians 0 56 44
have 0 56 44
a 0 56 44
vested 0 56 44
interest 0 56 44
in 0 56 44
the 0 56 44
truth 0 56 44
coming 0 56 44
out 0 56 44
on 0 56 44
this 0 56 44
topic. 0 56 44

My 0 56 45
friend 0 56 45
John 0 56 45
Vibes 0 56 45
is 0 56 45
an 1 56 45
amazing 1 56 45
person 1 56 45
who 0 56 45
contributes 0 56 45
to 0 56 45
The 0 56 45
Free 0 56 45
Thought 0 56 45
Project. 0 56 45

He 0 56 46
said: 0 56 46

This 0 56 47
signifies 0 56 47
a 0 56 47
re-consolidation 0 56 47
of 0 56 47
the 0 56 47
media. 0 56 47

Cable 0 56 48
news 0 56 48
media 0 56 48
controlled 0 56 48
the 0 56 48
narrative 0 56 48
for 0 56 48
most 0 56 48
of 0 56 48
modern 0 56 48
history, 0 56 48
but 0 56 48
the 0 56 48
internet 0 56 48
has 0 56 48
lowered 0 56 48
that 0 56 48
barrier 0 56 48
to 0 56 48
entry 0 56 48
and 0 56 48
allowed 0 56 48
the 0 56 48
average 0 56 48
person 0 56 48
to 0 56 48
become 0 56 48
the 0 56 48
media 0 56 48
themselves. 0 56 48

This 0 56 49
obviously 0 56 49
took 0 56 49
market 0 56 49
share 0 56 49
and 0 56 49
influence 0 56 49
away 0 56 49
from 0 56 49
the 0 56 49
traditional 0 56 49
media, 0 56 49
and 0 56 49
it 0 56 49
has 0 56 49
allowed 0 56 49
for 0 56 49
a 0 56 49
more 0 56 49
diverse 0 56 49
public 0 56 49
conversation. 0 56 49

Now 0 56 50
it 0 56 50
seems 0 56 50
the 0 56 50
platforms 0 56 50
that 0 56 50
have 0 56 50
monopolized 0 56 50
the 0 56 50
industry 0 56 50
are 0 56 50
favoring 0 56 50
mainstream 0 56 50
sources 0 56 50
and 0 56 50
silencing 0 56 50
alternative 0 56 50
voices. 0 56 50

So 0 56 51
now, 0 56 51
instead 0 56 51
of 0 56 51
allowing 0 56 51
more 0 56 51
people 0 56 51
to 0 56 51
have 0 56 51
a 0 56 51
voice, 0 56 51
these 0 56 51
platforms 0 56 51
are 0 56 51
creating 0 56 51
an 0 56 51
atmosphere 0 56 51
where 0 56 51
only 0 56 51
powerful 0 56 51
media 0 56 51
organizations 0 56 51
are 0 56 51
welcome, 0 56 51
just 0 56 51
as 0 56 51
we 0 56 51
had 0 56 51
on 0 56 51
cable 0 56 51
news. 0 56 51

People 0 56 52
think 0 56 52
that 0 56 52
we 0 56 52
are 0 56 52
just 0 56 52
providing 0 56 52
an 0 56 52
activist 0 56 52
spin 0 56 52
on 0 56 52
the 0 56 52
news, 0 56 52
but 0 56 52
they 0 56 52
don’t 0 56 52
see 0 56 52
the 0 56 52
families 0 56 52
struggling 0 56 52
to 0 56 52
have 0 56 52
their 0 56 52
voice 0 56 52
heard. 0 56 52

For 0 56 53
example, 0 56 53
when 0 56 53
someone 0 56 53
is 0 56 53
shot 0 56 53
by 0 56 53
police, 0 56 53
mainstream 0 56 53
media 0 56 53
sources 0 56 53
often 0 56 53
just 0 56 53
republish 0 56 53
the 0 56 53
press 0 56 53
release 0 56 53
from 0 56 53
the 0 56 53
police 0 56 53
department, 0 56 53
without 0 56 53
presenting 0 56 53
the 0 56 53
victim’s 0 56 53
side 0 56 53
of 0 56 53
the 0 56 53
story. 0 56 53

We 0 56 54
give 0 56 54
the 0 56 54
victims 0 56 54
and 0 56 54
their 0 56 54
families 0 56 54
a 0 56 54
voice, 0 56 54
which 0 56 54
is 0 56 54
essential 0 56 54
to 0 56 54
keep 0 56 54
power 0 56 54
in 0 56 54
check. 0 56 54

This 0 56 55
also 0 56 55
goes 0 56 55
for 0 56 55
bigger 0 56 55
issues 0 56 55
like 0 56 55
foreign 0 56 55
policy 0 56 55
as 0 56 55
well; 0 56 55
multiple 0 56 55
full-scale 0 56 55
invasions 0 56 55
of 0 56 55
Syria 0 56 55
have 0 56 55
been 0 56 55
prevented 0 56 55
because 0 56 55
of 0 56 55
information 0 56 55
that 0 56 55
the 0 56 55
alternative 0 56 55

Our 0 56 60

generally 0 56 60
is 0 56 60
to 0 56 60
cover 0 56 60
stories 0 56 60
and 0 56 60
angles 0 56 60

fact-checked 0 56 61

I 0 56 62
got 0 56 62
into 0 56 62
this 0 56 62
line 0 56 62
of 0 56 62
work 0 56 62
because 0 56 62
I 0 56 62
felt 0 56 62
there 0 56 62
was 0 56 62
a 0 56 62
need 0 56 62
for 0 56 62
media 0 56 62
that 0 56 62
challenged 0 56 62
mainstream 0 56 62
assumptions 0 56 62
and 0 56 62
biases 0 56 62
in 0 56 62
politics. 0 56 62

I 0 56 63
wanted 0 56 63
to 0 56 63
shed 0 56 63
light 0 56 63
on 0 56 63
corruption 0 56 63

wrongdoing 0 56 63
against 0 56 63
oppressed 0 56 63

and 0 56 63
cover 0 56 63
the 0 56 63
harsh 1 56 63
truth 1 56 63
about 0 56 63
American 0 56 63

Over 0 56 64
the 0 56 64

The 0 56 65
timing 0 56 65
of 0 56 65
this 0 56 65
purge 0 56 65
is 0 56 65
rather 0 56 65
dubious 1 56 65
in 0 56 65
my 0 56 65
view, 0 56 65
coming 0 56 65
shortly 0 56 65
before 0 56 65
the 0 56 65
midterm 0 56 65

This 1 56 66
could 1 56 66
be 1 56 66
an 1 56 66
attempt 1 56 66
by 1 56 66

itself 1 56 66
to 1 56 66

The 0 56 67

caught 0 56 67
me 0 56 67
by 0 56 67
surprise. 0 56 67

I 0 56 68
can 0 56 68
only 0 56 68
speculate 0 56 68
that 0 56 68
these 0 56 68

Back 0 56 72
in 0 56 72
September, 0 56 72
an 0 56 72

All 0 56 73

I 0 56 74
wrote 0 56 74
at 0 56 74
the 0 56 74

“Alex 0 56 74

the 0 56 74

It’s 0 56 75
going 0 56 75

Infowars 0 56 77
is 0 56 77
a 0 56 77
massive 0 56 77

machine. 0 56 77

But 0 56 78
what 0 56 78
happens 0 56 78
when 0 56 78
similar 0 56 78
attacks 0 56 78

us 0 56 79
right 0 56 79
in 0 56 79
the 0 56 79

And 0 56 80
if 0 56 80
they’re 0 56 80
hit 0 56 80
hard 0 56 80
enough, 0 56 80
they’ll 0 56 80

has 0 56 81
a 0 56 81

so 0 56 81
this 0 56 81
may 0 56 81

the 0 56 81

for 0 56 81
most 0 56 81

this 0 56 81
would 0 56 81
be 0 56 81
the 0 56 81

our 0 56 82

It’s 0 56 83
far 0 56 83
more 0 56 83
expensive 0 56 83
than 0 56 83
most 0 56 83

government. 0 56 111

This 0 56 112
affects 0 56 112
everyone. 0 56 112

If 0 56 113
you’re 0 56 113
reading 0 56 113
this 0 56 113
and 0 56 113
you 0 56 113
shrug 0 56 113
because 0 56 113
you, 0 56 113
personally, 0 56 113
don’t 0 56 113
have 0 56 113
a 0 56 113
Twitter 0 56 113
or 0 56 113
Facebook 0 56 113
account, 0 56 113
you’re 0 56 113
missing 0 56 113
the 0 56 113
bigger 0 56 113
point. 0 56 113

Consider 0 56 114
the 0 56 114
fact 0 56 114
that 0 56 114
the 0 56 114
“population” 0 56 114
of 0 56 114
Facebook 0 56 114
is 0 56 114
bigger 0 56 114
than 0 56 114
the 0 56 114
populations 0 56 114
of 0 56 114
the 0 56 114
US, 0 56 114
China, 0 56 114
and 0 56 114
Brazil 0 56 114
combined. 0 56 114

That’s 0 56 115
how 0 56 115
many 0 56 115
people 0 56 115
will 0 56 115
now 0 56 115
only 0 56 115
receive 0 56 115
one 0 56 115
side 0 56 115
of 0 56 115
the 0 56 115
story 0 56 115
on 0 56 115
things 0 56 115
like 0 56 115
war, 0 56 115
politics, 0 56 115
guns, 0 56 115
and 0 56 115
current 0 56 115
events. 0 56 115

People 0 56 116
will 0 56 116
believe 0 56 116
what 0 56 116
they’re 0 56 116
told 0 56 116
because 0 56 116
there 0 56 116
is 0 56 116
no 0 56 116
alternative 0 56 116
information 0 56 116
presented. 0 56 116

There 0 56 117
are 0 56 117
no 0 56 117
questions 0 56 117
asked. 0 56 117

It’s 0 56 118

Social 0 56 122

If 0 56 123
the 0 56 123
information 0 56 123
is 0 56 123
rigged 0 56 123
by 0 56 123
entities 0 56 123
that 0 56 123
support 0 56 123
socialism, 0 56 123

and 0 56 123
the 0 56 123
end 0 56 123
of 0 56 123

we’re 1 56 123
doomed. 1 56 123

2.2 0 56 124
billion 0 56 124
active 0 56 124
users 0 56 124
will 0 56 124
be 0 56 124
bombarded 1 56 124
with 0 56 124
these 0 56 124

the 0 56 124
other 0 56 124
side 0 56 124
of 0 56 124
the 0 56 124

So 0 56 125
regardless 0 56 125
of 0 56 125
whether 0 56 125
you, 0 56 125
personally, 0 56 125

this 0 56 125

sentiment 0 56 125
to 0 56 125
a 0 56 125
massive 1 56 125
degree. 0 56 125

It 0 56 126
will 0 56 126
grow 0 56 126
the 0 56 126

that 0 56 126

“the 1 56 126
government 1 56 126
is 1 56 126
your 1 56 126

and 0 56 126
that 0 56 126
“you 1 56 126

People 0 56 127
who 0 56 127

get 0 56 127
unfettered 0 56 127

the 0 56 127
minds 0 56 127
of 0 56 127
2 0 56 127
billion 0 56 127

That 1 56 128
should 1 56 128
scare 1 56 128
the 1 56 128
crap 1 56 128
out 1 56 128
of 1 56 128
you. 1 56 128

What 0 56 129
can 0 56 129
you 0 56 129
do 0 56 129
about 0 56 129
the 0 56 129
alternative 0 56 129
media 0 56 129
purge? 0 56 129

It’s 0 56 130
possible 0 56 130
but 0 56 130
unlikely 0 56 130
that 0 56 130
social 0 56 130
pressure 0 56 130
on 0 56 130
Facebook 0 56 130

But 0 56 131
even 0 56 131
if 0 56 131
they 0 56 131
are 0 56 131
restored, 0 56 131
I 0 56 131
suspect 0 56 131
their 0 56 131

The 0 56 142

is 0 56 142
getting 0 56 142
harder 1 56 142
and 1 56 142
harder 1 56 142

though 0 59 15
they 0 59 15
are 0 59 15
on 0 59 15

Sara 0 59 16
Berg, 0 59 16
a 0 59 16
senior 0 59 16
writer 0 59 16
at 0 59 16
AMA, 0 59 16
was 0 59 16
the 0 59 16
author 0 59 16
of 0 59 16
the 0 59 16
lengthy 0 59 16
post 0 59 16
which 0 59 16
calls 0 59 16
for 0 59 16
all 0 59 16
sorts 0 59 16
of 0 59 16
government 0 59 16
overreach 0 59 16
and 0 59 16
unconstitutional 0 59 16
legislation. 0 59 16

And 0 59 17
though 0 59 17
she 0 59 17
has 0 59 17
a 0 59 17
huge 0 59 17
laundry 0 59 17
list 0 59 17
of 0 59 17
things 0 59 17
the 0 59 17
AMA 0 59 17
supports, 0 59 17
she 0 59 17
fails, 0 59 17
like 0 59 17
every 0 59 17
other 0 59 17
Socialist 0 59 17
and 0 59 17
Communist, 0 59 17
to 0 59 17
tell 0 59 17
us 0 59 17
exactly 0 59 17
how 0 59 17
these 0 59 17
measures 0 59 17
keep 0 59 17
people 0 59 17
safe 0 59 17
and 0 59 17
weapons 0 59 17
out 0 59 17
of 0 59 17
the 0 59 17
hands 0 59 17
of 0 59 17
criminals. 0 59 17

Berg 0 59 18
and 0 59 18
the 0 59 18
AMA 0 59 18
want 0 59 18
to 0 59 18
pull 0 59 18
a 0 59 18
Dick's 0 59 18
Sporting 0 59 18
Goods 0 59 18
and 0 59 18
demand 0 59 18
that 0 59 18
people 0 59 18
be 0 59 18
21 0 59 18
before 0 59 18
they 0 59 18
can 0 59 18
purchase 0 59 18
a 0 59 18
firearm. 0 59 18

Does 0 59 19
Berg 0 59 19
and 0 59 19
the 0 59 19
AMA 0 59 19
support 0 59 19
our 1 59 19
military? 0 59 19

Do 0 59 20
they 0 59 20
not 0 59 20
know 0 59 20
that 0 59 20
18-year-olds 0 59 20
carry 0 59 20
firearms, 0 59 20
both 0 59 20
handguns 0 59 20
and 0 59 20
rifles? 0 59 20

I 0 59 21
ask, 0 59 21
as 0 59 21
I 0 59 21
do 0 59 21
with 0 59 21
the 0 59 21
issue 0 59 21
concerning 0 59 21
alcohol, 0 59 21
what 0 59 21
is 0 59 21
magic 0 59 21
about 0 59 21
the 0 59 21
age 0 59 21
of 0 59 21
21? 0 59 21

I 0 59 22
ask, 0 59 22
where 0 59 22
does 0 59 22
government 0 59 22
get 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
determine 0 59 22
who 0 59 22
gets 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
do 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
at 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
age 0 59 22
based 0 59 22
on 0 59 22
an 0 59 22
ambiguous 0 59 22
age 0 59 22
number? 0 59 22

Yet, 0 59 23
if 1 59 23
we 1 59 23
do 1 59 23
that, 1 59 23
we 1 59 23
won't 1 59 23
have 1 59 23
to 1 59 23
worry 1 59 23
about 1 59 23
mass 1 59 23
shooters, 1 59 23
right? 0 59 23

Wrong. 0 59 24

Yeah, 0 59 25
that's 0 59 25
gonna 0 59 25
keep 0 59 25
people 0 59 25
safe. 0 59 25

It's 0 59 26
going 0 59 26
to 0 59 26
infringe 0 59 26
on 0 59 26
the 0 59 26
rights 0 59 26
of 0 59 26
those 0 59 26
who 0 59 26
don't 0 59 26
commit 0 59 26
crimes 0 59 26
and 0 59 26
need 0 59 26
a 0 59 26
gun 0 59 26
to 0 59 26
protect 0 59 26
themselves 0 59 26
or 0 59 26
be 0 59 26
part 0 59 26
of 0 59 26
the 0 59 26
constitutional 0 59 26
militia. 0 59 26

The 0 59 27
AMA 0 59 27
also 0 59 27
wants 0 59 27
to 0 59 27
bypass 0 59 27
the 0 59 27
Fifth 0 59 27
Amendment 0 59 27
protections 0 59 27
concerning 0 59 27

found 0 59 27
guilty 0 59 27
of 0 59 27
a 0 59 27
crime 0 59 27
being 0 59 27
deprived 0 59 27
of 0 59 27
their 0 59 27
liberty 0 59 27
and 0 59 27
property 0 59 27
as 0 59 27
they 0 59 27
promote 0 59 27
a 0 59 27
new 0 59 27
legal 0 59 27
procedure 0 59 27
by 0 59 27
which 0 59 27
“family 0 59 27
members, 0 59 27
intimate 0 59 27
partners, 0 59 27
household 0 59 27
members 0 59 27
and 0 59 27
law 0 59 27
enforcement 0 59 27
personnel” 0 59 27
can 0 59 27
petition 0 59 27
courts 0 59 27
to 0 59 27
confiscate 0 59 27
firearms 0 59 27
from 0 59 27
people 0 59 27
“when 0 59 27
there 0 59 27
is 0 59 27

or 0 59 27
imminent 0 59 27
risk 0 59 27
for 0 59 27
violence.” 0 59 27

They 0 59 28
want 0 59 28
to 0 59 28
do 0 59 28
what 0 59 28
President 0 59 28
Donald 0 59 28
Trump 0 59 28
suggested 0 59 28
and 0 59 28
"take 0 59 28
the 0 59 28
guns 0 59 28
first" 0 59 28
and 0 59 28
forget 0 59 28
due 0 59 28
process. 0 59 28

See? 0 59 29

This 0 59 30
is 0 59 30
why 0 59 30
they 0 59 30
should 0 59 30
be 0 59 30
honest 0 59 30
about 0 59 30
who 0 59 30
they 0 59 30
are 0 59 30
and 0 59 30

themselves 0 59 30

Non-American 1 59 30
Medical 0 59 30
Association. 0 59 30

I'm 0 59 31
all 0 59 31
for 0 59 31
situations 0 59 31
like 0 59 31
Nikolas 0 59 31
Cruz 0 59 31
who 0 59 31
assaulted 0 59 31

and 0 59 31
students 0 59 31
being 0 59 31
arrested 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
tried 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
dealt 0 59 31
with 0 59 31
lawfully, 0 59 31
but 0 59 31
to 0 59 31
go 0 59 31
seizing 0 59 31
people's 0 59 31
property 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
denying 0 59 31
them 0 59 31
their 0 59 31
liberty 0 59 31
base 0 59 31
on 0 59 31
the 0 59 31
hearsay 0 59 31
of 0 59 31
another 0 59 31
person 0 59 31
is 0 59 31
anti-constitutional 0 59 31
and 0 59 31
anti-American. 1 59 31

Who 0 59 32
knows 0 59 32
exactly 0 59 32
what 0 59 32
they 0 59 32
mean 0 59 32
by 0 59 32
high-capacity 0 59 32
magazines. 0 59 32

I 0 59 33
mean, 0 59 33
for 0 59 33
the 0 59 33
most 0 59 33
part, 0 59 33
you 0 59 33
can 0 59 33
obtain 0 59 33
20 0 59 33
or 0 59 33
30 0 59 33
round 0 59 33

for 0 59 33
both 0 59 33
handguns 0 59 33
and 0 59 33
rifles. 0 59 33

In 0 59 34
some 0 59 34
cases, 0 59 34
you 0 59 34
can 0 59 34
purchase 0 59 34
drums 0 59 34
which 0 59 34
hold 0 59 34
50-100 0 59 34
rounds, 0 59 34
but 0 59 34
if 0 59 34
you 0 59 34
are 0 59 34
in 0 59 34
New 0 59 34

more 0 59 34
than 0 59 34
7 0 59 34
rounds. 0 59 34

As 0 59 35
for 0 59 35
the 0 59 35
nonsensical 1 59 35
call 0 59 35
to 0 59 35
ban 0 59 35
armor-piercing 0 59 35

if 0 59 35
you 0 59 35
are 0 59 35
using 0 59 35

they 0 59 35

I 0 59 49
also 0 59 49

it 0 59 49

for 0 59 49
the 0 59 49

say 0 59 49
they 0 59 49

identifying 0 59 49

is 0 61 34
not 0 61 34
going 0 61 34
to 0 61 34
be 0 61 34
able 0 61 34
to 0 61 34
ban 0 61 34
guns, 0 61 34
and 0 61 34
limits 0 61 34
on 0 61 34
the 0 61 34
size 0 61 34
of 0 61 34
bullet 0 61 34
magazines 0 61 34
will 0 61 34
be 0 61 34
even 1 61 34
more 1 61 34
laughable 1 61 34
than 0 61 34
before. 0 61 34

Many 0 61 35
parts 0 61 35
of 0 61 35
a 0 61 35
gun 0 61 35
can 0 61 35
be 0 61 35
made 0 61 35
on 0 61 35
very 0 61 35
inexpensive, 0 61 35
plastic 0 61 35
3D 0 61 35
printers 0 61 35
or 0 61 35
even 0 61 35
from 0 61 35
simple 0 61 35
machine 0 61 35
tools. 0 61 35

It 0 61 36
will 0 61 36
be 0 61 36
even 0 61 36
more 0 61 36
difficult 0 61 36
to 0 61 36
impose 0 61 36
background 0 61 36
checks, 0 61 36
which 1 61 36
have 1 61 36
proven 1 61 36
quite 1 61 36
useless 1 61 36
anyway. 1 61 36

The 1 61 37
government 1 61 37
has 1 61 37
been 1 61 37
no 1 61 37
more 1 61 37
effective 1 61 37
at 1 61 37
stopping 1 61 37
criminals 1 61 37
from 1 61 37
getting 1 61 37
guns 1 61 37
than 1 61 37
at 1 61 37
stopping 1 61 37
them 1 61 37
from 1 61 37
obtaining 1 61 37
drugs. 1 61 37

That 0 61 38
isn’t 0 61 38
too 0 61 38
surprising, 0 61 38
as 0 61 38
drug 0 61 38
gangs 0 61 38
are 0 61 38
the 0 61 38
source 0 61 38
of 0 61 38
both 0 61 38
illegal 0 61 38
drugs 0 61 38
and 0 61 38
guns. 0 61 38

This 0 61 39
was 0 61 39
a 0 61 39
tough 0 61 39
battle 0 61 39
for 0 61 39
the 0 61 39
plaintiff's, 0 61 39
SAF 0 61 39
and 0 61 39
DD. 0 61 39

They 0 61 40
lost 0 61 40
many 0 61 40
lower 0 61 40
court 0 61 40
rulings. 0 61 40

Gun-control 0 61 41
advocates 0 61 41
believe 0 61 41
that 0 61 41
the 1 61 41
government 1 61 41
"capitulated" 1 61 41
too 0 61 41
soon. 0 61 41

Prevent 0 61 42

Violence, 0 61 42
said 0 61 42
the 1 61 42
administration 1 61 42
“capitulated 1 61 42
in 0 61 42
a 0 61 42
case 0 61 42
it 0 61 42
had 0 61 42
won 0 61 42
at 0 61 42
every 0 61 42
step 0 61 42
of 0 61 42
the 0 61 42
way. 0 61 42

This 1 61 43
isn’t 1 61 43
a 1 61 43
case 1 61 43
where 1 61 43
the 1 61 43
underlying 1 61 43
facts 1 61 43
of 1 61 43
the 1 61 43
law 1 61 43
changed. 1 61 43

The 1 61 44
only 1 61 44
thing 1 61 44
that 1 61 44
changed 1 61 44
was 1 61 44
the 1 61 44

The 0 61 45
concept 0 61 45
of 0 61 45
making 0 61 45
guns 0 61 45
with 0 61 45
3D 0 61 45
printers 0 61 45
in 0 61 45
an 0 61 45
age 0 61 45
where 0 61 45
just 0 61 45
one 0 61 45
year 0 61 45
can 0 61 45
render 0 61 45
much 0 61 45
technology 0 61 45
obsolete 0 61 45
shouldn't 0 61 45
surprise 0 61 45
anyone. 0 61 45

Nor 0 61 46
should 0 61 46
the 0 61 46
fact 0 61 46
that 0 61 46
instructions 0 61 46

are 0 61 46
easily 0 61 46
available 0 61 46
for 0 61 46
download 0 61 46
over 0 61 46
the 0 61 46
internet. 0 61 46

At 0 61 47
the 0 61 47
click 0 61 47
of 0 61 47
a 0 61 47
mouse, 0 61 47
we 0 61 47
can 0 61 47
summon 0 61 47
almost 0 61 47
any 0 61 47
information 0 61 47
we 0 61 47
could 0 61 47
possibly 0 61 47
need 0 61 47
including 0 61 47
instructions 0 61 47
for 0 61 47
making 0 61 47
a 0 61 47
bomb. 0 61 47

The 0 61 48
ability 0 61 48
to 0 61 48
build 0 61 48
an 0 61 48
untraceable, 0 61 48
unregistered 0 61 48

is 0 61 48
definitely 0 61 48
a 1 61 48
game 1 61 48
changer. 1 61 48

It's 0 61 49
difficult 0 61 49
to 0 61 49
see 0 61 49
how 0 61 49
"ghost 1 61 49

Thursday 0 62 4
afternoon 0 62 4
Sheriff 0 62 4
Jerry 0 62 4

out 0 62 4
an 0 62 4
affidavit 0 62 4
for 0 62 4
a 0 62 4

that 0 62 4

a 0 62 4
makeshift 0 62 4

in 0 62 4
Costilla 0 62 4

that 0 62 4

reasonably 0 62 4

who 0 62 4
was 0 62 4

Wahhaj, 0 62 4
the 0 62 4
child 0 62 4
that 0 62 4
was 0 62 4
abducted. 0 62 4

This 0 62 5
warrant 0 62 5
came 0 62 5
after 0 62 5
a 0 62 5
two-month 0 62 5
investigation 0 62 5
in 0 62 5
conjunction 0 62 5
with 0 62 5
Clayton 0 62 5

investigators. 0 62 5

According 0 62 6
to 0 62 6
Sheriff 0 62 6
Hogrefe 0 62 6
the 0 62 6
FBI 0 62 6
had 0 62 6
recently 0 62 6
provided 0 62 6
information 0 62 6
and 0 62 6
surveillance 0 62 6
on 0 62 6
this 0 62 6
location, 0 62 6
but 0 62 6
they 0 62 6
(FBI) 0 62 6
didn’t 0 62 6
feel 0 62 6
there 0 62 6
was 0 62 6
enough 0 62 6
probable 0 62 6
cause 0 62 6
to 0 62 6
get 0 62 6
on 0 62 6
the 0 62 6
property. 0 62 6

In 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
press 0 62 7
release 0 62 7
Sheriff 0 62 7
Hogrefe 0 62 7
said, 0 62 7
“That 0 62 7
all 0 62 7
changed 0 62 7
for 0 62 7
me 0 62 7
when 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
message 0 62 7
was 0 62 7
forwarded 0 62 7
to 0 62 7
us 0 62 7
from 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
Georgia 0 62 7
Detective 0 62 7
that 0 62 7
we 0 62 7
reasonably 0 62 7
believed 0 62 7
came 0 62 7
from 0 62 7
someone 0 62 7
at 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
compound 0 62 7
– 0 62 7
the 0 62 7
message 0 62 7
sent 0 62 7
to 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
third 0 62 7
party 0 62 7
simply 0 62 7
said 0 62 7
in 0 62 7
part 0 62 7
“we 0 62 7
are 0 62 7
starving 0 62 7
and 0 62 7
need 0 62 7
food 0 62 7
and 0 62 7
water”. 0 62 7

I 0 62 8
absolutely 0 62 8
knew 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
we 0 62 8
couldn’t 0 62 8
wait 0 62 8
on 0 62 8
another 0 62 8
agency 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
step 0 62 8
up 0 62 8
and 0 62 8
we 0 62 8
had 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
go 0 62 8
check 0 62 8
this 0 62 8
out 0 62 8
as 0 62 8
soon 0 62 8
as 0 62 8
possible, 0 62 8
so 0 62 8
I 0 62 8
began 0 62 8
working 0 62 8
on 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
search 0 62 8
warrant 0 62 8
right 0 62 8
after 0 62 8
I 0 62 8
got 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
intercepted 0 62 8
message 0 62 8
– 0 62 8
it 0 62 8
had 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
be 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
search 0 62 8
warrant 0 62 8
and 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
tactical 0 62 8
approach 0 62 8
for 0 62 8
our 0 62 8
own 0 62 8
safety 0 62 8
because 0 62 8
we 0 62 8
had 0 62 8
learned 0 62 8
the 0 62 8
occupants 0 62 8
were 0 62 8
most 0 62 8
likely 0 62 8
heavily 0 62 8
armed 0 62 8
and 0 62 8
considered 0 62 8
extremist 1 62 8
of 1 62 8
the 1 62 8
Muslim 1 62 8
belief. 1 62 8

We 0 62 9
also 0 62 9
knew 0 62 9
from 0 62 9
the 0 62 9
layout 0 62 9
of 0 62 9
the 0 62 9
compound 0 62 9
they 0 62 9
would 0 62 9
have 0 62 9
an 0 62 9
advantage 0 62 9
if 0 62 9
we 0 62 9
didn’t 0 62 9
deploy 0 62 9
tactfully 0 62 9
and 0 62 9
quickly.” 0 62 9

On 0 62 10
Friday 0 62 10
morning, 0 62 10

The 0 62 11
“all 0 62 11

went 0 62 11

any 0 62 11

when 0 62 11
encountered 0 62 11
both 0 62 11
men 0 62 11
initially 0 62 11
refused 0 62 11

held 0 62 11
up 0 62 11
inside 0 62 11
the 0 62 11

one 0 62 11

Many 0 62 12
more 0 62 12
rounds 0 62 12
of 0 62 12

were 0 62 12

“The 0 62 13

“But 0 62 14
what 0 62 14
was 0 62 14

extremely 1 65 13
lethal. 1 65 13

although 0 65 19
the 0 65 19
real 0 65 19
figure 0 65 19
is 0 65 19
thought 0 65 19
to 0 65 19
be 0 65 19
significantly 0 65 19
higher. 0 65 19

More 0 65 20
than 0 65 20
99 0 65 20
percent 0 65 20
of 0 65 20
victims 0 65 20
were 0 65 20
in 0 65 20
the 0 65 20
three 0 65 20
West 0 65 20

although 0 65 20
cases 0 65 20
occurred 0 65 20
in 0 65 20
other 0 65 20
parts 0 65 20
of 0 65 20
the 0 65 20
world, 0 65 20
often 0 65 20
stirring 0 65 20

“The 0 66 23

Goldwater 0 73 4
took 0 73 4
on 0 73 4
the 0 73 4
GOP 0 73 4
establishment 0 73 4
in 0 73 4
the 0 73 4

the 0 73 4
Civil 0 73 4
Rights 0 73 4
Act 0 73 4
of 0 73 4
1964, 0 73 4
defiantly 0 73 4
declared, 0 73 4
"Extremism 1 73 4
in 1 73 4
the 1 73 4
defense 1 73 4
of 1 73 4
liberty 1 73 4
is 1 73 4
no 1 73 4

and 0 73 4
then 0 73 4
went 0 73 4
down 0 73 4

assassination 0 73 4

The 0 73 5
real 0 73 5
"Mr. 1 73 5
Conservative" 1 73 5
was 0 73 5
a 0 73 5
true 0 73 5
profile 0 73 5
in 0 73 5
courage. 0 73 5

Flake, 0 73 6

only 0 73 6
18 0 73 6
percent 0 73 6
approval 0 73 6

Arizona, 0 73 6
decided 0 73 6
to 0 73 6
pack 0 73 6
it 0 73 6

rather 0 73 6
than 0 73 6
get 0 73 6
waxed 0 73 6
in 0 73 6
his 0 73 6
own 0 73 6
primary. 0 73 6

With 0 73 7
Falstaff, 0 73 7
Flake 0 73 7
appears 0 73 7
to 0 73 7
believe 0 73 7
that 0 73 7
"discretion 1 73 7
is 1 73 7
the 1 73 7
better 1 73 7
part 1 73 7
of 1 73 7

Sen. 0 73 8
Bob 0 73 8
Corker 0 73 8
is 0 73 8
another 0 73 8
summertime 1 73 8
soldier 1 73 8
calling 0 73 8
on 0 73 8
colleagues 0 73 8

fight 0 73 8
Trump 0 73 8
while 1 73 8
he 1 73 8
retires 1 73 8
to 1 73 8
Tennessee. 1 73 8

It's 0 73 9
no 0 73 9
wonder 0 73 9
the 0 73 9
establishment 0 73 9
is 0 73 9
viewed 0 73 9
with 0 73 9
such 0 73 9
derision. 1 73 9

Flake 0 73 10
calls 0 73 10
Trump 0 73 10
"dangerous 1 73 10
to 1 73 10
our 1 73 10
democracy." 1 73 10

But 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
real 0 73 11
threat 0 73 11
Trump 0 73 11
represents 0 73 11
is 0 73 11
to 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
GOP 0 73 11
establishment's 0 73 11
control 0 73 11
of 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
party's 0 73 11
agenda 0 73 11
and 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
party's 0 73 11
destiny. 0 73 11

U.S. 0 73 12
politics 0 73 12
have 0 73 12
indeed 0 73 12
been 0 73 12
coarsened, 0 73 12
with 0 73 12
Trump 0 73 12
playing 0 73 12
a 0 73 12
lead 0 73 12
role. 0 73 12

Yet, 0 73 13
beneath 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
savagery 1 73 13
of 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
uncivil 0 73 13
war 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
party 0 73 13
lies 0 73 13
more 0 73 13
than 0 73 13
personal 0 73 13
insults 0 73 13
and 0 73 13
personality 0 73 13
clashes. 0 73 13

This 0 73 14
is 0 73 14
a 0 73 14
struggle 0 73 14
about 0 73 14
policy, 0 73 14
about 1 73 14
the 1 73 14
future. 1 73 14

And 0 73 15
Trump 1 73 15
is 1 73 15
president 1 73 15
because 1 73 15
he 1 73 15
read 1 73 15
the 1 73 15
party 1 73 15
and 1 73 15
the 1 73 15
country 1 73 15
right, 1 73 15
while 0 73 15
the 0 73 15
Bush-McCain 0 73 15
Republican 0 73 15
establishment 0 73 15
had 0 73 15
lost 0 73 15
touch 0 73 15
with 0 73 15
both. 0 73 15

How 1 73 16
could 1 73 16
the 1 73 16
Beltway 1 73 16
GOP 1 73 16
not 1 73 16

Bushite 1 73 17

accomplish? 0 73 22

Thousands 0 73 23

Yet, 0 73 24
still, 0 73 24
the 0 73 24

Yesterday's 0 73 33
New 0 73 33
York 0 73 33
Times 0 73 33
recognized 0 73 33
Trump's 0 73 33
triumph: 1 73 33

"Despite 0 73 34
the 0 73 34
fervor 0 73 34
of 0 73 34
President 0 73 34
Trump's 0 73 34
Republican 0 73 34
opponents, 0 73 34
the 0 73 34
president's 0 73 34
brand 0 73 34
of 0 73 34
hard-edged 1 73 34
nationalism—with 0 73 34

cultural 0 73 34
appeals 0 73 34
and 0 73 34

taking 0 73 34
root 0 73 34
within 0 73 34
his 0 73 34
adopted 0 73 34
party." 0 73 34

Moreover, 0 73 35
a 0 73 35
new 0 73 35
question 0 73 35
arises: 0 73 35

Can 0 73 36
the 0 73 36
GOP 0 73 36
establishment 0 73 36
believe 0 73 36
that 0 73 36
if 0 73 36
Trump 0 73 36
falls, 0 73 36
or 0 73 36
they 0 73 36
bring 0 73 36
him 0 73 36
down, 0 73 36
they 0 73 36
will 0 73 36
inherit 0 73 36
the 0 73 36
estate 0 73 36
and 0 73 36
be 0 73 36
welcomed 0 73 36
home 0 73 36
like 0 73 36
the 0 73 36
Prodigal 1 73 36
Son? 1 73 36

Do 1 73 37
they 1 73 37
believe 1 73 37
their 1 73 37
old 1 73 37
agenda 1 73 37
of 1 73 37
open 1 73 37
borders, 1 73 37
amnesty, 1 73 37
free 1 73 37
trade 1 73 37
globalism 1 73 37
and 1 73 37
democracy-crusading 1 73 37
can 1 73 37
become 1 73 37
America's 1 73 37
agenda 1 73 37
again? 1 73 37

Trumpism 1 73 38
is 0 73 38
not 0 73 38
a 0 73 38
detour, 0 73 38
after 0 73 38
which 0 73 38
we 0 73 38
can 0 73 38
all 0 73 38
get 0 73 38
back 0 73 38
on 0 73 38
the 0 73 38
interstate 0 73 38
to 0 73 38
the 0 73 38
New 0 73 38
World 0 73 38
Order. 0 73 38

For 0 73 39
though 0 73 39
unpleasant, 0 73 39
it 0 73 39
is 0 73 39
not 0 73 39
unfair 0 73 39
to 0 73 39
say 0 73 39
that 0 73 39
if 0 73 39
there 0 73 39
was 0 73 39
one 0 73 39
desire 0 73 39
common 0 73 39
to 0 73 39
Bernie 0 73 39
Sanders, 0 73 39
Ted 0 73 39
Cruz 0 73 39
and 0 73 39
Donald 0 73 39
Trump 0 73 39
voters, 0 73 39
it 0 73 39
was 0 73 39
be 0 73 39
rid 0 73 39
of 0 73 39
the 0 73 39
regime 0 73 39
resting 0 73 39
on 0 73 39
top 0 73 39
of 0 73 39
all 0 73 39
of 0 73 39
us. 0 73 39

Should 1 73 40
Trump 1 73 40
fall, 1 73 40
and 1 73 40
a 1 73 40
restored 1 73 40
establishment 1 73 40
attempt 1 73 40
to 1 73 40
reimpose 1 73 40
the 1 73 40
old 1 73 40
policies, 1 73 40
there 1 73 40
will 1 73 40
be 1 73 40
a 1 73 40
truly 1 73 40
uncivil 1 73 40
war 1 73 40
in 1 73 40
this 1 73 40
country. 1 73 40

After 1 73 41
the 1 73 41
Trumpian 1 73 41
revolt, 1 73 41
there 1 73 41
is 1 73 41
no 1 73 41
going 1 73 41
back. 1 73 41

As 0 73 42
that 0 73 42
most 1 73 42
American 1 73 42
of 1 73 42
writers, 1 73 42
Thomas 0 73 42
Wolfe, 0 73 42
put 0 73 42
it, 0 73 42
"You 0 73 42
can't 0 73 42
go 0 73 42
home 0 73 42
again." 0 73 42

Traditionalists 0 73 43
have 0 73 43
been 0 73 43
told 0 73 43
that 0 73 43
for 0 73 43
years. 0 73 43

Now 0 73 44
it's 0 73 44
the 0 73 44
turn 0 73 44
of 0 73 44
the 0 73 44
GOP 0 73 44
establishment 0 73 44
to 0 73 44
learn 0 73 44
the 0 73 44
truth 0 73 44
as 0 73 44
well. 0 73 44

Goldwater 0 73 45
lost 0 73 45
badly, 0 73 45
but 0 73 45
the 0 73 45
establishment 0 73 45
that 0 73 45
abandoned 0 73 45
him 0 73 45
never 0 73 45
had 0 73 45
its 0 73 45
patrimony 0 73 45
restored. 0 73 45

It 0 73 46
was 0 73 46
the 0 73 46
leaders 0 73 46
they 0 73 46
abhorred, 0 73 46

None 0 74 52

The 0 74 53

refute 0 74 53

beyond 0 74 53
that, 0 74 53
the 1 74 53

they 0 74 54

Fr. 0 75 5

Weinandy, 0 75 6
a 0 75 6
former 0 75 6
chief 0 75 6
of 0 75 6
staff 0 75 6
for 0 75 6
the 0 75 6
U.S. 0 75 6
Bishops’ 0 75 6
Committee 0 75 6
on 0 75 6
Doctrine 0 75 6
and 0 75 6
a 0 75 6
member 0 75 6
of 0 75 6
the 0 75 6
Vatican’s 0 75 6
International 0 75 6
Theological 0 75 6
Commission, 0 75 6
warned 0 75 6
Pope 0 75 6
Francis 0 75 6
that 0 75 6
he 0 75 6
has 0 75 6
caused 0 75 6
“chronic 0 75 6
confusion” 0 75 6
among 0 75 6
the 0 75 6
faithful 0 75 6
and 0 75 6
bishops. 0 75 6

He 0 75 7
wrote 0 75 7
to 0 75 7
the 0 75 7
pope, 0 75 7
“To 1 75 7
teach 1 75 7
with 1 75 7
such 1 75 7
an 1 75 7
intentional 1 75 7
lack 1 75 7
of 1 75 7
clarity 1 75 7
inevitably 1 75 7
risks 1 75 7
sinning 1 75 7
against 1 75 7
the 1 75 7
Holy 1 75 7
Spirit, 1 75 7
the 1 75 7
Spirit 1 75 7
of 1 75 7
truth.” 1 75 7
He 0 75 7
added 0 75 7
that 0 75 7
Catholics 0 75 7
are 0 75 7
“disconcerted” 0 75 7
by 0 75 7
the 0 75 7
appointment 0 75 7
of 0 75 7
bishops 0 75 7
“who 0 75 7
seem 0 75 7
not 0 75 7
merely 0 75 7
open 0 75 7
to 0 75 7
those 0 75 7
who 0 75 7
hold 0 75 7
views 0 75 7
counter 0 75 7
to 0 75 7
Christian 0 75 7
belief, 0 75 7
but 0 75 7
who 0 75 7
support 0 75 7
and 0 75 7
even 0 75 7
defend 0 75 7
them.” 0 75 7

In 0 75 8
an 0 75 8
interview 0 75 8
yesterday 0 75 8
with 0 75 8
John 0 75 8
Allen’s 0 75 8
Crux, 0 75 8
he 0 75 8
added, 0 75 8
more 0 75 8
prophetically 0 75 8
than 0 75 8
he 0 75 8
had 0 75 8
perhaps 0 75 8
intended, 0 75 8
“I 0 75 8
don’t 0 75 8
think 0 75 8
anyone 0 75 8
can, 0 75 8
or 0 75 8
should, 0 75 8
associate 0 75 8
my 0 75 8
letter 0 75 8
with 0 75 8
the 0 75 8
USCCB 0 75 8
or 0 75 8
the 0 75 8
American 0 75 8
bishops. 0 75 8

Neither 0 75 9
was 0 75 9
involved 0 75 9
in 0 75 9
my 0 75 9
writing 0 75 9
the 0 75 9
letter, 0 75 9
and 0 75 9
its 0 75 9
publication 0 75 9
will 0 75 9
be 0 75 9
news 0 75 9
to 0 75 9
them.” 0 75 9

“Bishops 0 75 10
are 0 75 10
quick 0 75 10
learners,” 0 75 10
he 0 75 10
wrote 0 75 10
in 0 75 10
his 0 75 10
letter, 0 75 10
“and 0 75 10
what 0 75 10
many 0 75 10
have 0 75 10
learned 0 75 10
from 0 75 10
your 0 75 10
pontificate 0 75 10
is 0 75 10
not 0 75 10
that 0 75 10
you 0 75 10
are 0 75 10
open 0 75 10
to 0 75 10
criticism, 0 75 10
but 0 75 10
that 0 75 10
you 0 75 10
resent 0 75 10
it,” 0 75 10
claiming 0 75 10
that 0 75 10
many 0 75 10
bishops 0 75 10
don’t 1 75 10
speak 1 75 10
out 1 75 10
publicly 1 75 10
for 1 75 10
fear 1 75 10
they 1 75 10
will 1 75 10
be 1 75 10
“marginalized 1 75 10
or 1 75 10
worse.” 1 75 10

And 0 75 11
sure 0 75 11
enough, 0 75 11
within 0 75 11
hours 0 75 11
of 0 75 11
making 0 75 11
his 0 75 11
letter 0 75 11
public, 0 75 11
we 0 75 11
learned 0 75 11
that 0 75 11
Fr. 0 75 11

Weinandy 0 75 12
had 0 75 12
been 0 75 12
given 1 75 12
the 1 75 12
boot. 1 75 12

Of 0 75 13
course, 0 75 13
the 0 75 13
Twitterverse 0 75 13
is 0 75 13
busy 0 75 13
commenting 0 75 13
on 0 75 13
the 0 75 13
irony: 0 75 13
how 0 75 13
a 0 75 13
man 0 75 13
expressing 0 75 13
grave 0 75 13
concerns 0 75 13
that 0 75 13
there 0 75 13
is 0 75 13
an 0 75 13
atmosphere 0 75 13
of 0 75 13
fear 0 75 13
of 0 75 13
being 0 75 13
punished 0 75 13
for 0 75 13
expressing 0 75 13
grave 0 75 13
concerns, 0 75 13
was 0 75 13
immediately 0 75 13
fired. 0 75 13

Perhaps 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
most 0 75 14
astonishing 0 75 14
aspect 0 75 14
of 0 75 14
this 0 75 14
little 1 75 14
incident 1 75 14
is 0 75 14
just 0 75 14
how 0 75 14
completely 0 75 14
blind 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
US 0 75 14
bishops 0 75 14
– 0 75 14
as 0 75 14
with 0 75 14
nearly 0 75 14
all 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
episcopate 0 75 14
– 0 75 14
are 0 75 14
to 0 75 14
what 0 75 14
political 0 75 14
analysts 0 75 14
call 0 75 14
the 0 75 14
“optics”. 0 75 14

Political 0 75 15
consultants 0 75 15
often 0 75 15
ask: 0 75 15
how 0 75 15
does 0 75 15
it 0 75 15
look? 0 75 15

And 0 75 16
it 0 75 16
looks 0 75 16
extremely 1 75 16
bad. 1 75 16

As 0 75 17
though 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
fog 0 75 17
of 0 75 17
irony 0 75 17
weren’t 0 75 17
thick 0 75 17
enough, 0 75 17
in 0 75 17
response 0 75 17
to 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
outrage 0 75 17
from 0 75 17
Catholics, 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
USCCB 0 75 17
has 0 75 17
done 0 75 17
what 0 75 17
all 0 75 17
the 0 75 17
other 0 75 17
members 0 75 17
of 0 75 17
Pope 0 75 17
Francis’ 0 75 17
cabal 0 75 17
have 0 75 17
done 0 75 17
and 0 75 17
started 0 75 17
blocking 0 75 17
critics 0 75 17
from 0 75 17
its 0 75 17
Twitter 0 75 17
account. 0 75 17

Which, 0 75 18
it 0 75 18
must 0 75 18
be 0 75 18
said, 0 75 18
only 0 75 18
proves 0 75 18
Fr. 0 75 18

Weinandy’s 0 75 19
point 0 75 19
once 0 75 19
again. 0 75 19

Some 0 75 20
of 0 75 20
the 0 75 20
criticism 0 75 20
has 0 75 20
been 0 75 20
unusually 0 75 20
sharp. 0 75 20

Fr. 0 75 21

Hunwicke 0 75 22

this 0 75 22
afternoon, 0 75 22
“This 0 75 22

in 0 75 23

As 0 75 24
I 0 75 24
write 0 75 24
this, 0 75 24
the 0 75 24
outrage 0 75 24

doing 0 75 24
the 0 75 24
opposite 0 75 24
of 0 75 24
dying 0 75 24
down, 0 75 24

is 0 75 24
surely 0 75 24
a 0 75 24

of 0 75 24
how 0 75 24
fed 0 75 24
up 0 75 24

even 0 75 24

never 0 75 24

themselves 0 75 24
as 0 75 24
Traditionalists 0 75 24
– 0 75 24
have 0 75 24
become 0 75 24
with 0 75 24

In 0 75 25
his 0 75 25
letter, 0 75 25
Fr. 0 75 25

Weinandy 0 75 26
made 0 75 26
a 0 75 26
point 0 75 26
of 0 75 26
stating 0 75 26
that 0 75 26
he 0 75 26

saying, 0 75 27

“I 0 75 28
see 0 75 28
that 0 75 28
Fr. 0 75 28

Thomas 0 75 29
Weinandy 0 75 29
has 0 75 29
been 0 75 29
squashed. 0 75 29

He 0 75 30
was 0 75 30
one 0 75 30
of 0 75 30
my 0 75 30
professors 0 75 30
in 0 75 30
Patristics 0 75 30
at 0 75 30
Oxford 0 75 30
and 0 75 30
he 0 75 30
was 0 75 30
one 0 75 30
of 0 75 30
the 0 75 30
most 0 75 30
mild-mannered, 0 75 30
least 0 75 30
confrontational, 0 75 30
kindest 0 75 30
academics 0 75 30
one 0 75 30
could 0 75 30
have 0 75 30
hoped 0 75 30
to 0 75 30
meet. 0 75 30

To 0 75 31
me, 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
fact 0 75 31
that 0 75 31
he 0 75 31
has 0 75 31
chosen 0 75 31
to 0 75 31
write 0 75 31
to 0 75 31
express 0 75 31
his 0 75 31
concern 0 75 31
about 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
crisis 0 75 31
in 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
church 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
papacy 0 75 31
is 0 75 31
very 0 75 31
significant. 0 75 31

He 0 75 32
is 0 75 32
neither 0 75 32
a 0 75 32
traditionalist, 0 75 32
nor 0 75 32
a 0 75 32
controversialist, 0 75 32
but 0 75 32
a 0 75 32
humble 0 75 32
and 0 75 32
straightforward 0 75 32
Friar 0 75 32
who 0 75 32
is 0 75 32
clear-thinking 0 75 32
and 0 75 32
entirely 0 75 32
loyal 0 75 32
to 0 75 32
the 0 75 32
Church 0 75 32
and 0 75 32
Her 0 75 32
teaching. 0 75 32

I 0 75 33
would 0 75 33
be 0 75 33
surprised 0 75 33
now 0 75 33
if 0 75 33
we 0 75 33
were 0 75 33
not 0 75 33
see 0 75 33
more 0 75 33

this 0 75 33
sort 0 75 33
of 0 75 33
letter/exercise 0 75 33
of 0 75 33
conscience. 0 75 33

I 0 75 34
imagine 0 75 34
that 0 75 34
it’s 0 75 34
going 0 75 34
to 0 75 34
become 0 75 34
harder 0 75 34
and 0 75 34
harder 0 75 34
for 0 75 34
men 0 75 34
of 0 75 34
conscience 0 75 34
and 0 75 34
position 0 75 34
to 0 75 34
sit 0 75 34
on 0 75 34
the 0 75 34
fence.” 0 75 34

When 0 75 35
I 0 75 35
posted 0 75 35
it, 0 75 35
this 0 75 35
assessment 0 75 35
was 0 75 35
backed 0 75 35
up 0 75 35
by 0 75 35
Joseph 0 75 35
Shaw, 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
head 0 75 35
of 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
UK’s 0 75 35
Latin 0 75 35
Mass 0 75 35
Society 0 75 35
and 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
spokesman 0 75 35
for 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
Filial 0 75 35
Correction, 0 75 35
who 0 75 35
wrote, 0 75 35
“This 0 75 35
is 0 75 35
absolutely 0 75 35
right. 0 75 35

Not 0 75 36
a 0 75 36
man 0 75 36
to 0 75 36
seek 0 75 36
out 0 75 36
confrontation.” 0 75 36

The 0 75 37
Crux 0 75 37
piece 0 75 37
offered 0 75 37
a 0 75 37
succinct 0 75 37
bullet 0 75 37
point 0 75 37
list 0 75 37
of 0 75 37
Fr. 0 75 37

Weinandy’s 0 75 38
concerns. 0 75 38

He 0 75 39
said 0 75 39
the 0 75 39
pope 0 75 39
is… 0 75 39

Fostering 0 75 40
“chronic 0 75 40
confusion.” 0 75 40

“Demeaning” 0 75 41
the 0 75 41
importance 0 75 41
of 0 75 41
doctrine. 0 75 41

Appointing 0 75 42
bishops 0 75 42
who 1 75 42
“scandalize” 1 75 42
believers 1 75 42
with 0 75 42
dubious 0 75 42
“teaching 0 75 42
and 0 75 42
pastoral 0 75 42
practice.” 0 75 42

Giving 0 75 43
prelates 0 75 43
who 0 75 43
object 0 75 43
the 0 75 43
impression 0 75 43
they’ll 1 75 43
be 1 75 43
“marginalized 1 75 43
or 1 75 43
worse” 1 75 43
if 1 75 43
they 1 75 43
speak 1 75 43
out. 1 75 43

Causing 0 75 44
faithful 0 75 44
Catholics 0 75 44
to 0 75 44
“lose 0 75 44
confidence 0 75 44
in 0 75 44
their 0 75 44
supreme 1 75 44
shepherd.” 1 75 44

Our 0 75 45
friend 0 75 45
Edward 0 75 45
Pentin 0 75 45
has 0 75 45
reproduced 0 75 45
the 0 75 45

Register 0 75 45
which 0 75 45
is 0 75 45
definitely 0 75 45
worth 0 75 45
a 0 75 45
read. 0 75 45

Fr. 0 75 46

Weinandy 0 75 47
sent 0 75 47
the 0 75 47
letter 0 75 47
to 0 75 47
the 0 75 47
pope 0 75 47
on 0 75 47
July 0 75 47
31, 0 75 47
the 0 75 47
Feast 0 75 47
of 0 75 47
St. 0 75 47
Ignatius 0 75 47
of 0 75 47
Loyola. 0 75 47

Like 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
Dubia 0 75 48
cardinals, 0 75 48
he 0 75 48
said 0 75 48
he 0 75 48
made 0 75 48
it 0 75 48
public 0 75 48
only 0 75 48
after 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
pope 0 75 48
had 0 75 48
ignored 0 75 48
it 0 75 48
for 0 75 48
months. 0 75 48

Notable 0 75 49
in 0 75 49
his 0 75 49
critique 0 75 49
is 0 75 49
its 0 75 49
distinct 0 75 49
pastoral 0 75 49
flavour, 0 75 49
his 0 75 49
concern 0 75 49
on 0 75 49
the 0 75 49
effect 0 75 49
the 0 75 49
situation 0 75 49
is 0 75 49
having 0 75 49
on 0 75 49
ordinary 0 75 49
people. 0 75 49

The 0 75 50
pope, 0 75 50
he 0 75 50
said, 0 75 50
seems 0 75 50
“to 0 75 50
censor 0 75 50
and 0 75 50
even 0 75 50
mock” 0 75 50
critics 0 75 50
of 0 75 50
Amoris 0 75 50
Laetitia 0 75 50
for 0 75 50
their 0 75 50
desire 0 75 50
to 0 75 50
interpret 0 75 50
it 0 75 50
in 0 75 50
keeping 0 75 50
with 0 75 50
Catholic 0 75 50
teaching, 0 75 50
and 0 75 50
in 0 75 50
doing 0 75 50
so 0 75 50
is 0 75 50
committing 0 75 50
a 0 75 50
“kind 0 75 50
of 0 75 50
calumny…alien 0 75 50
to 0 75 50
the 0 75 50
nature 0 75 50
of 0 75 50
the 0 75 50
Petrine 0 75 50
ministry.” 0 75 50

In 0 75 51
an 0 75 51
interview 0 75 51
with 0 75 51
Crux, 0 75 51
Weinandy 0 75 51
said 0 75 51
he 0 75 51
is 0 75 51
not 0 75 51
afraid 0 75 51
of 0 75 51
reprisals 0 75 51
but 0 75 51
“more 0 75 51
concerned 0 75 51
about 0 75 51
the 0 75 51
good 0 75 51
that 0 75 51
my 0 75 51
letter 0 75 51
might 0 75 51
do.” 0 75 51
The 0 75 51
letter 0 75 51
“expresses 0 75 51
the 0 75 51
concerns 0 75 51
of 0 75 51
many 0 75 51
more 0 75 51
people 0 75 51
than 0 75 51
just 0 75 51
me, 0 75 51
ordinary 0 75 51
people 0 75 51
who’ve 0 75 51
come 0 75 51
to 0 75 51
me 0 75 51
with 0 75 51
their 0 75 51
questions 0 75 51
and 0 75 51
apprehensions. 0 75 51

I 0 75 52
wanted 0 75 52
them 0 75 52
to 0 75 52
know 0 75 52
that 0 75 52
I 0 75 52
listened.” 0 75 52

“I 0 75 53
have 1 75 53
done 1 75 53
what 1 75 53
I 1 75 53
believe 1 75 53
God 1 75 53
wanted 1 75 53
me 1 75 53
to 1 75 53
do,[1]” 1 75 53
he 0 75 53
said. 0 75 53

In 0 75 54
fact, 0 75 54
Fr. 0 75 54

Weinandy 0 75 55
has 0 75 55
bolstered 1 75 55
my 1 75 55
own 1 75 55
“Great 1 75 55
Clarifier” 1 75 55
theory, 1 75 55
saying 0 75 55
that 0 75 55
this 0 75 55
pontificate, 0 75 55
and 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
lack 0 75 55
of 0 75 55
response 0 75 55
to 0 75 55
it 0 75 55
from 0 75 55
priests 0 75 55
and 0 75 55
bishops, 0 75 55
is 0 75 55
being 0 75 55
allowed 0 75 55
by 0 75 55
God 0 75 55
in 0 75 55
order 0 75 55
to 0 75 55
reveal 0 75 55
“just 0 75 55
how 0 75 55
weak 0 75 55
is 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
faith 0 75 55
of 0 75 55
many 0 75 55
within 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
Church,” 0 75 55
He 0 75 55
added 0 75 55
that 0 75 55
Francis 0 75 55
has 0 75 55
revealed 0 75 55
that 0 75 55
many 0 75 55
in 0 75 55
the 0 75 55
Church 0 75 55
“hold 0 75 55
harmful 0 75 55
theological 0 75 55
and 0 75 55
pastoral 0 75 55
views.” 0 75 55

Which 0 75 56
inevitably 0 75 56
brings 0 75 56
to 0 75 56
mind 0 75 56
other 0 75 56
responses 0 75 56
that 0 75 56
have 0 75 56
not 0 75 56
been 0 75 56
quite 0 75 56
so 0 75 56
clear, 0 75 56
nor 0 75 56
so 0 75 56
pastoral. 0 75 56

When 0 75 57
Cardinal 0 75 57
Muller 0 75 57
was 0 75 57
removed 0 75 57
abruptly 0 75 57
from 0 75 57
his 0 75 57
position 0 75 57
as 0 75 57
head 0 75 57
of 0 75 57
the 0 75 57
CDF, 0 75 57
the 0 75 57
conservative 0 75 57
Catholic 0 75 57
world 0 75 57
wailed 0 75 57
that 0 75 57
it 0 75 57
was 0 75 57
another 0 75 57
case 0 75 57
of 0 75 57
a 0 75 57
“good” 0 75 57
prelate 0 75 57
being 0 75 57
got 0 75 57
rid 0 75 57
of. 0 75 57

And 0 75 58
it 0 75 58
seems 0 75 58
clear 0 75 58
from 0 75 58
the 0 75 58
way 0 75 58
it 0 75 58
was 0 75 58
done, 0 75 58
and 0 75 58
the 0 75 58
way 0 75 58
Francis 0 75 58
treated 0 75 58
Muller 0 75 58
in 0 75 58
general, 0 75 58
that 0 75 58
he 0 75 58
was 0 75 58
indeed 0 75 58
got 1 75 58
rid 1 75 58
of. 1 75 58

But 0 75 59
his 0 75 59
depiction 0 75 59
by 0 75 59
conservative 0 75 59
writers 0 75 59
as 0 75 59
a 0 75 59
beleaguered 0 75 59
champion 0 75 59
of 0 75 59
Catholic 0 75 59
orthodoxy 0 75 59
persecuted 0 75 59
by 0 75 59
the 0 75 59
regime 0 75 59
for 0 75 59
his 0 75 59
faithfulness 0 75 59
betrays 0 75 59
a 0 75 59
somewhat 0 75 59
selective 0 75 59
memory 0 75 59
and 0 75 59
short 0 75 59
attention 0 75 59
span. 0 75 59

Ed 0 75 60
Pentin 0 75 60
has 0 75 60
a 0 75 60
long 0 75 60
file 0 75 60
of 0 75 60
interviews 0 75 60
and 0 75 60
articles 0 75 60
about 0 75 60
Muller 0 75 60
that 0 75 60
clearly 0 75 60
show 0 75 60
his 0 75 60
complete 0 75 60
inability 0 75 60
to 0 75 60
make 0 75 60
up 0 75 60
his 0 75 60
mind 0 75 60
whose 0 75 60
side 0 75 60
he’s 0 75 60
on. 0 75 60

A 0 75 61
quick 0 75 61
examination 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
Muller’s 0 75 61
interviews 0 75 61
and 0 75 61
statements 0 75 61
reveal 0 75 61
an 0 75 61
irresolute 0 75 61
and 0 75 61
ultimately 0 75 61
calculating 0 75 61
mind 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
a 0 75 61
man 0 75 61
who 0 75 61
is 0 75 61
– 0 75 61
so 0 75 61
I 0 75 61
am 0 75 61
told 0 75 61
by 0 75 61
sources 0 75 61
close 0 75 61
to 0 75 61
him 0 75 61
– 0 75 61
motivated 0 75 61
mainly 0 75 61
by 0 75 61
a 0 75 61
puerile 0 75 61
desire 0 75 61
to 0 75 61
be 0 75 61
approved 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
by 0 75 61
the 1 75 61
“cool 1 75 61
kids” 1 75 61
in 1 75 61
the 1 75 61
Vatican, 1 75 61
on 0 75 61
the 0 75 61
one 0 75 61
hand, 0 75 61
and 0 75 61
an 0 75 61
unshakeable 0 75 61
conviction 0 75 61
of 0 75 61
his 0 75 61
own 0 75 61
theological 0 75 61
brilliance 0 75 61
on 0 75 61
the 0 75 61
other. 0 75 61

Most 0 75 62
recently, 0 75 62
on 0 75 62
October 0 75 62
30th, 0 75 62
Crux 0 75 62
quoted 0 75 62
him 0 75 62
under 0 75 62
the 0 75 62
headline, 0 75 62
“Cardinal 0 75 62

unrepentant 0 75 62
adulterers. 0 75 62

Signaling 1 75 63
furiously 1 75 63
with 0 75 63
the 0 75 63
trendy 0 75 63
FrancisChurch 0 75 63
buzzwords 0 75 63
and 0 75 63
even 0 75 63
trendier 0 75 63
blithering 1 75 63
incoherence, 1 75 63
Muller 0 75 63
writes 0 75 63
that 0 75 63
“mitigating 0 75 63
factors 0 75 63
in 0 75 63
guilt,” 0 75 63
can 0 75 63
lead, 0 75 63
couples 0 75 63
in 0 75 63
“an 0 75 63
uncertain 0 75 63
marital 0 75 63
situation” 0 75 63
through 0 75 63
a 0 75 63
“path 0 75 63
of 0 75 63
repentance” 0 75 63
– 0 75 63
always 0 75 63
“accompanied” 0 75 63
by 0 75 63
an 0 75 63
exquisitely 0 75 63
sensitive 0 75 63
confessor 0 75 63
– 0 75 63
to 0 75 63
a 0 75 63
point 0 75 63
where 0 75 63
the 0 75 63
reception 0 75 63
of 0 75 63
Communion 0 75 63
is 0 75 63
no 0 75 63
longer 0 75 63
sinful. 0 75 63

Presumably 1 75 64
because 1 75 64
adultery 1 75 64
itself 1 75 64
is 1 75 64
no 1 75 64
longer 1 75 64
sinful. 1 75 64

Or 0 75 65
sacrilege 0 75 65
either, 0 75 65
I 0 75 65
guess. 0 75 65

Or 0 75 66
something. 0 75 66

Somehow 0 75 67
the 0 75 67
“new 0 75 67
evangelization” 0 75 67
is 0 75 67
involved 0 75 67
in 0 75 67
this, 0 75 67
though 0 75 67
it’s 0 75 67
unclear 0 75 67
how 0 75 67
exactly 0 75 67
it 0 75 67
makes 0 75 67
adultery 0 75 67
and 0 75 67
sacrilege 0 75 67
OK. 0 75 67
Also, 0 75 67
it’s 0 75 67
very 0 75 67
important 0 75 67
to 0 75 67
fulfill 0 75 67
the 0 75 67
Sunday 0 75 67
Mass 0 75 67
obligation, 0 75 67
and 0 75 67
as 0 75 67
everyone 0 75 67
knows, 0 75 67
one 0 75 67
can’t 0 75 67
possibly 0 75 67
go 0 75 67
to 0 75 67
Mass 0 75 67
on 0 75 67
a 0 75 67
Sunday 0 75 67
without 0 75 67
receiving 0 75 67
Communion. 0 75 67

We 0 75 68
hear 0 75 68
again, 0 75 68
as 0 75 68
we 0 75 68
did 0 75 68
incessantly 0 75 68
from 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
Kasperians 0 75 68
at 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
Synods, 0 75 68
about 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
hard 0 75 68
case 0 75 68
of 0 75 68
the 1 75 68
poor, 1 75 68
poor 1 75 68
woman 1 75 68
who 0 75 68
has 0 75 68
been 0 75 68
abandoned 0 75 68
by 0 75 68
the 0 75 68
first 0 75 68
husband, 0 75 68
and 0 75 68
who 0 75 68
“finds 0 75 68
no 0 75 68
other 0 75 68
way 0 75 68
out 0 75 68
than 0 75 68
to 0 75 68
entrust 0 75 68
oneself 0 75 68
to 0 75 68
a 0 75 68
kind-hearted 0 75 68
person,” 0 75 68
… 0 75 68
with 1 75 68
whom, 1 75 68
I 1 75 68
guess, 1 75 68
she 1 75 68
has 1 75 68
also 1 75 68
no 1 75 68
choice 1 75 68
but 1 75 68
to 1 75 68
have 1 75 68
sexual 1 75 68
relations. 1 75 68

Because 1 75 69
of 1 75 69
kind-heartedness. 1 75 69

Anyway, 0 75 70
the 0 75 70
result 0 75 70
of 0 75 70
this 0 75 70
is 0 75 70
a 0 75 70
“marriage-like 0 75 70
relationship” 0 75 70
about 0 75 70
which 0 75 70
confessors 0 75 70
have 0 75 70
to 0 75 70
be 0 75 70
very 0 75 70
careful 0 75 70
not 0 75 70
to 0 75 70
say 0 75 70
mean 0 75 70
things. 0 75 70

Or 0 75 71
be 0 75 71
too 0 75 71
“extreme”. 0 75 71

It’s 0 75 72
very 0 75 72
important 0 75 72
for 0 75 72
him 0 75 72
to 0 75 72
avoid 0 75 72
a 0 75 72
“cheap 0 75 72
adaptation 0 75 72
to 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
relativistic 1 75 72
Zeitgeist,” 1 75 72
on 0 75 72
one 0 75 72
side, 0 75 72
and 0 75 72
a 0 75 72
“cold 0 75 72
application 0 75 72
of 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
dogmatic 0 75 72
commandments 0 75 72
and 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
canonical 0 75 72
rules,” 0 75 72
on 0 75 72
the 0 75 72
other. 0 75 72

Because 0 75 73
that 0 75 73
could 0 75 73
be 0 75 73
too 0 75 73
polarizing. 0 75 73

And 0 75 74
mean. 0 75 74

And 0 75 75
anyway, 0 75 75
sins 0 75 75
of 0 75 75
the 0 75 75
flesh 0 75 75
aren’t 0 75 75
the 0 75 75
worst 0 75 75
things 0 75 75
ever. 0 75 75

There 0 75 76
are, 0 75 76
like, 0 75 76
“different 0 75 76
levels” 0 75 76
of 0 75 76
gravity, 0 75 76
you 0 75 76
know? 0 75 76

And, 0 75 77
like, 0 75 77
it 0 75 77
depends 0 75 77
on 0 75 77
the 0 75 77
type 0 75 77
of 0 75 77
sin, 0 75 77
right? 0 75 77

“Spirit’s 0 75 78
sins” 0 75 78
like 0 75 78
spiritual 0 75 78
pride 0 75 78
and 0 75 78
avarice 0 75 78
and 0 75 78
stuff, 0 75 78
are 0 75 78
worse 0 75 78
than 0 75 78
“sins 0 75 78
of 0 75 78
the 0 75 78
flesh,” 0 75 78
you 0 75 78
know? 0 75 78

Which 0 75 79
are, 0 75 79
like, 0 75 79
only 0 75 79
a 0 75 79
result 0 75 79
of 0 75 79
“human 0 75 79
weakness,” 0 75 79
right? 0 75 79

Apparently 0 75 80
the 0 75 80
real 0 75 80
problem 0 75 80
with 0 75 80
this 0 75 80
whole 0 75 80
thing 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
been 0 75 80
that 0 75 80
the 0 75 80
Kasperian 0 75 80
kerfuffle 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
totally 0 75 80
been 0 75 80
blown 0 75 80
way, 0 75 80
way, 0 75 80
WAY 0 75 80
out 0 75 80
of 0 75 80
proportion, 0 75 80
and 0 75 80
the 0 75 80
“polarization” 0 75 80
it 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
caused 0 75 80
has 0 75 80
been 0 75 80
“regrettable”. 0 75 80

The 0 75 81
question 0 75 81
of 0 75 81
Communion 0 75 81
for 0 75 81
divorced 0 75 81
and 0 75 81
civilly 0 75 81
“remarried” 0 75 81
Catholics, 0 75 81
he 0 75 81
said, 0 75 81
has 0 75 81
been 0 75 81
“falsely 1 75 81
elevated 1 75 81
to 1 75 81
the 1 75 81
rank 1 75 81
of 1 75 81
a 1 75 81
decisive 1 75 81
question 1 75 81
of 1 75 81
Catholicism 1 75 81
and 1 75 81
a 1 75 81
measure 1 75 81
of 1 75 81
ideological 1 75 81
comparison 1 75 81
in 1 75 81
order 1 75 81
to 1 75 81
decide 1 75 81
whether 1 75 81
one 1 75 81
is 1 75 81
conservative 1 75 81
or 1 75 81
liberal, 1 75 81
in 1 75 81
favor 1 75 81
or 1 75 81
against 1 75 81
the 1 75 81
pope.” 1 75 81

For 0 75 82
years 0 75 82
under 0 75 82
Pope 0 75 82
Benedict, 0 75 82
Muller 0 75 82
was 0 75 82
engaged 0 75 82
in 0 75 82
an 0 75 82
open 0 75 82
war 0 75 82
with 0 75 82
the 0 75 82
German 0 75 82
episcopate 0 75 82
who 0 75 82
insisted 0 75 82
that 0 75 82
they 0 75 82
were 0 75 82
going 0 75 82
to 0 75 82
allow 0 75 82
Communion 0 75 82
for 0 75 82
the 0 75 82
divorced 0 75 82
and 0 75 82
remarried, 0 75 82
no 0 75 82
matter 0 75 82
what 0 75 82
Rome 0 75 82
said, 0 75 82
even 1 75 82
threatening 1 75 82
to 1 75 82
go 1 75 82
into 1 75 82
schism 1 75 82
if 1 75 82
they 1 75 82
didn’t 1 75 82
get 1 75 82
their 1 75 82
way[2]. 0 75 82

Muller, 0 75 83
with 0 75 83
little 0 75 83
backing 0 75 83
from 0 75 83
Pope 0 75 83
Benedict 0 75 83
– 0 75 83
who 0 75 83
appeared 0 75 83
content 0 75 83
to 0 75 83
allow 0 75 83
his 0 75 83
CDF 0 75 83
prefect 0 75 83
and 0 75 83
the 0 75 83
Germans 0 75 83
shout 0 75 83
out 0 75 83
their 0 75 83
differences 0 75 83
– 0 75 83
and 0 75 83
with 0 75 83
outright 0 75 83
opposition 0 75 83
from 0 75 83
Francis, 0 75 83
did 0 75 83
indeed 0 75 83
strive 0 75 83
to 0 75 83
hold 0 75 83
the 0 75 83
line. 0 75 83

The 0 75 84
fact 0 75 84
that 0 75 84
Francis 0 75 84
orchestrated 0 75 84
the 0 75 84
Synods 0 75 84
to 0 75 84
undermine 0 75 84
him 0 75 84
was 0 75 84
certainly 0 75 84
not 0 75 84
his 0 75 84
fault. 0 75 84

And 0 75 85
it 0 75 85
is 0 75 85
difficult 0 75 85
to 0 75 85
imagine 0 75 85
anyone 0 75 85
being 0 75 85
in 0 75 85
a 0 75 85
worse 0 75 85
position 0 75 85
than 0 75 85
he 0 75 85
was 0 75 85
at 0 75 85
the 0 75 85
time. 0 75 85

But 0 75 86
since 0 75 86
then, 0 75 86
Muller 0 75 86
has 0 75 86
demonstrated 0 75 86
very 0 75 86
little 0 75 86
of 0 75 86
his 0 75 86
former 0 75 86
grit, 0 75 86
instead 0 75 86
attempting 0 75 86
from 0 75 86
one 0 75 86
day 0 75 86
to 0 75 86
the 0 75 86
next 0 75 86
to 0 75 86
appease 0 75 86
both 0 75 86
sides. 0 75 86

Reportedly 0 75 87
removed 0 75 87
from 0 75 87
CDF 0 75 87
– 0 75 87
and 0 75 87
of 0 75 87
course 0 75 87
lionized 1 75 87
by 0 75 87
“conservatives” 0 75 87
– 0 75 87
for 0 75 87
his 0 75 87
mild 0 75 87
and 0 75 87
equivocating 0 75 87
opposition 0 75 87
to 0 75 87
Amoris 0 75 87
Laetitia, 0 75 87
Muller 0 75 87
has 0 75 87
gone 0 75 87
back 0 75 87
and 0 75 87
forth 0 75 87
in 0 75 87
what 0 75 87
can 0 75 87
easily 0 75 87
be 0 75 87
seen 0 75 87
as 0 75 87
a 0 75 87
desperate 0 75 87
attempt 0 75 87
to 0 75 87
find 0 75 87
friends 0 75 87
in 0 75 87
both 0 75 87
camps. 0 75 87

With 0 75 88
this 0 75 88
in 0 75 88
mind 0 75 88
one 0 75 88
could 0 75 88
be 0 75 88
forgiven 0 75 88
for 0 75 88
not 0 75 88
taking 0 75 88
his 0 75 88
October 0 75 88
30th 0 75 88
essay 0 75 88
too 0 75 88
seriously. 0 75 88

Perhaps 0 75 89
one 0 75 89
of 0 75 89
the 0 75 89
good 0 75 89
effects 0 75 89
to 0 75 89
come 0 75 89
from 0 75 89
Fr. 0 75 89

Weinandy’s 0 75 90
persecution 0 75 90
will 0 75 90
be 0 75 90
to 0 75 90
demonstrate 0 75 90
how 0 75 90
a 0 75 90
pastor 0 75 90
of 0 75 90
the 0 75 90
Catholic 0 75 90
Church 0 75 90
is 0 75 90
supposed 0 75 90
to 0 75 90
act. 0 75 90

As 0 75 91
my 0 75 91
friend 0 75 91
said, 0 75 91
maybe 0 75 91
“it’s 0 75 91
going 0 75 91
to 0 75 91
become 0 75 91
harder 0 75 91
and 0 75 91
harder 0 75 91
for 0 75 91
men 0 75 91
of 0 75 91
conscience 0 75 91
and 0 75 91
position 0 75 91
to 0 75 91
sit 0 75 91
on 0 75 91
the 0 75 91
fence,” 0 75 91

In 0 75 94
this 0 75 94
interview, 0 75 94
Fr. 0 75 94

Weinandy 0 75 95
gave 0 75 95
a 0 75 95
remarkable 0 75 95
story 0 75 95
of 0 75 95
how 0 75 95
his 0 75 95
prayer 0 75 95
for 0 75 95
a 0 75 95
“sign” 0 75 95
that 0 75 95
he 0 75 95
ought 0 75 95
to 0 75 95
write 0 75 95
the 0 75 95
letter 0 75 95
was 0 75 95
very 0 75 95
specifically 0 75 95
answered: 0 75 95
“If 0 75 95
you 0 75 95
want 0 75 95
me 0 75 95
to 0 75 95
write 0 75 95
something, 0 75 95
you 0 75 95
have 0 75 95
to 0 75 95
give 0 75 95
me 0 75 95
a 0 75 95
clear 0 75 95
sign,” 0 75 95
Weinandy 0 75 95
recalls 0 75 95
saying. 0 75 95

“Tomorrow 0 75 96
morning, 0 75 96
I’m 0 75 96
going 0 75 96
to 0 75 96
Saint 0 75 96
Mary 0 75 96
Major’s 0 75 96
to 0 75 96
pray, 0 75 96
and 0 75 96
then 0 75 96
I 0 75 96
am 0 75 96
going 0 75 96
to 0 75 96
Saint 0 75 96
John 0 75 96
Lateran. 0 75 96

After 0 75 97
that, 0 75 97
I’m 0 75 97
coming 0 75 97
back 0 75 97
to 0 75 97
Saint 0 75 97

out 0 76 4

that 0 76 4

it 1 76 18
all 1 76 18

The 0 77 12

if 0 77 12
someone 0 77 12
from 0 77 12

“I 0 77 13

that 0 77 13
was 0 77 13
what 0 77 13
they 0 77 13
wanted 0 77 13
to 0 77 13
write. 0 77 13

Nah, 0 77 14
I 0 77 14
don’t 0 77 14
have 0 77 14
no 0 77 14
problems 0 77 14
with 0 77 14

I 0 77 14
don’t 0 77 14

a 0 77 14
whole 0 77 14

those 0 77 14
kind 0 77 14
of 0 77 14
things,” 0 77 14
Davis 0 77 14
said. 0 77 14

“That’s 0 77 15
just 0 77 15
one 0 77 15
segment 0 77 15
of 0 77 15
what 0 77 15
goes 0 77 15
on 0 77 15
in 0 77 15
our 0 77 15
world. 0 77 15

The 1 77 16
world 1 77 16
is 1 77 16
so 1 77 16
much 1 77 16
bigger 1 77 16
than 1 77 16
Farrakhan 1 77 16
and 1 77 16
the 1 77 16
Jewish 1 77 16
question 1 77 16
and 1 77 16
his 1 77 16
position 1 77 16
on 1 77 16
that 1 77 16
and 1 77 16
so 1 77 16
forth. 1 77 16

For 0 77 17
those 0 77 17
heavy 0 77 17
into 0 77 17
it, 0 77 17
that’s 0 77 17
their 0 77 17
thing, 0 77 17
but 0 77 17
it 0 77 17
ain’t 0 77 17
my 0 77 17
thing,” 0 77 17
he 0 77 17
said 0 77 17

The 1 77 18
people 1 77 18
who 1 77 18
talk 1 77 18
about 1 77 18
the 1 77 18
"Jewish 1 77 18
question" 1 77 18
are 1 77 18
generally 1 77 18
anti-Semites. 1 77 18

Somehow 0 77 19
I 0 77 19
don't 0 77 19
think 0 77 19
a 0 77 19
white 0 77 19
congressman 0 77 19
would 0 77 19
get 0 77 19
away 0 77 19
with 0 77 19
saying 0 77 19
that 0 77 19
he 0 77 19
agrees 0 77 19
with 0 77 19
David 0 77 19
Duke 0 77 19
on 0 77 19
the 0 77 19
environment 0 77 19
but 0 77 19
isn't 0 77 19
especially 0 77 19
concerned 0 77 19
about 0 77 19
his 0 77 19
racism. 0 77 19

But 0 77 20
black 0 77 20
leaders 0 77 20
have 0 77 20
gotten 0 77 20
away 0 77 20
with 0 77 20
playing 0 77 20
that 0 77 20
game 0 77 20
with 0 77 20
Farrakhan 0 77 20
repeatedly. 0 77 20

But 0 77 21
the 0 77 21
ADL 0 77 21
and 0 77 21
the 0 77 21
JTA 0 77 21
will 0 77 21
whitewash 1 77 21
this 0 77 21
again. 0 77 21

And 1 77 22
if 1 77 22
they 1 77 22
can't 1 77 22
whitewash 1 77 22
this, 1 77 22
they'll 1 77 22
ignore 1 77 22
it. 1 77 22

That’s 0 78 12
right, 0 78 12
photographic 0 78 12
evidence 0 78 12
from 0 78 12
inside 0 78 12
the 0 78 12
hotel 0 78 12
parking 0 78 12
garage 0 78 12
has 0 78 12
confirmed 0 78 12
that 0 78 12
the 0 78 12
FBI, 0 78 12
along 0 78 12
with 0 78 12
state 0 78 12
and 0 78 12
local 0 78 12
police, 0 78 12
specifically 0 78 12
lied 0 78 12
about 0 78 12
key 0 78 12
details 0 78 12
of 0 78 12
the 0 78 12
shooting. 0 78 12

This 1 78 13
throws 1 78 13
their 1 78 13
entire 1 78 13
narrative 1 78 13
into 1 78 13
question 1 78 13
and 1 78 13
makes 1 78 13
one 1 78 13
wonder 1 78 13
what 1 78 13
else 1 78 13
is 1 78 13
being 1 78 13
hidden 1 78 13
from 1 78 13
the 1 78 13
public? 1 78 13

Keep 0 78 14
in 0 78 14
mind 0 78 14
that 0 78 14
at 0 78 14
least 0 78 14
four 0 78 14
videos 0 78 14
from 0 78 14
the 0 78 14
scene 0 78 14
of 0 78 14
the 0 78 14
shooting 0 78 14
have 0 78 14
already 0 78 14
been 0 78 14
released 0 78 14
that 0 78 14
indicate 0 78 14
there 0 78 14
were 0 78 14
multiple 0 78 14
shooters. 0 78 14

In 0 78 15
fact, 0 78 15
there 0 78 15
are 0 78 15
so 0 78 15
many 0 78 15
unanswered 0 78 15
questions 0 78 15
that 0 78 15
the 0 78 15
Drudge 0 78 15
Report 0 78 15
even 0 78 15
linked 0 78 15
to 0 78 15
an 0 78 15
article 0 78 15
asking 0 78 15
them 0 78 15
directly. 0 78 15

As 0 78 16
noted 0 78 16
above, 0 78 16
at 0 78 16
this 0 78 16
point 0 78 16
literally 0 78 16
every 0 78 16
piece 0 78 16
of 0 78 16
so-called 1 78 16
evidence 1 78 16
put 0 78 16
forth 0 78 16
by 0 78 16
authorities 0 78 16
and 0 78 16
then 0 78 16
regurgitated 0 78 16
by 0 78 16
the 0 78 16
mainstream 0 78 16
media 0 78 16
cannot 1 78 16
be 1 78 16
trusted 1 78 16
and 1 78 16
should 1 78 16
be 1 78 16
considered 1 78 16
as 1 78 16
disinformation 1 78 16
until 0 78 16
proven 0 78 16
otherwise. 0 78 16

And 0 78 17
if 0 78 17
Paddock 0 78 17
really 0 78 17
did 0 78 17
act 0 78 17
alone 0 78 17
and 0 78 17
this 0 78 17
evidence 0 78 17
is 0 78 17
some 0 78 17
sort 0 78 17
of 0 78 17
mistake, 0 78 17
there 0 78 17
is 0 78 17
surely 0 78 17
video 0 78 17
footage 0 78 17
proving 0 78 17
so. 0 78 17

malevolent 1 82 14
BDS 1 82 14

of 0 82 15
a 1 82 15

laced 1 82 15

anti-Semitic 1 82 15
overtones. 1 82 15

Campus 0 82 16

It 0 82 20
does 0 82 20

An 1 82 23
enlightened, 1 82 23

suddenly 1 82 23

In 0 82 24
October, 0 82 24

manner, 0 82 26

SSMU 0 82 26

managed 0 82 26
to 0 82 26
pick 0 82 26
off 0 82 26
their 0 82 26
opponents 0 82 26
one 0 82 26
at 0 82 26
a 0 82 26
time. 0 82 26

It 0 82 27
was 0 82 27
repulsive 1 82 27
display 1 82 27
leftist-fascist 1 82 27
bigotry 1 82 27
at 1 82 27
its 1 82 27
worst. 1 82 27

The 1 82 28
bigoted 1 82 28
BDS 1 82 28
provocateurs 1 82 28
applauded 0 82 28
as 0 82 28
Lew 0 82 28
and 0 82 28
the 0 82 28
other 0 82 28
two 0 82 28
board 0 82 28

were 0 82 28
removed 0 82 28
from 0 82 28
their 0 82 28
posts. 0 82 28

But 0 82 29
this 0 82 29
time, 0 82 29
they 0 82 29
may 0 82 29
have 0 82 29
gone 0 82 29
too 0 82 29
far. 0 82 29

Even 0 82 30
by 0 82 30
BDS 0 82 30
standards, 0 82 30
their 1 82 30
manifestly 1 82 30
anti-Semitic 1 82 30
campaign 1 82 30
antics 1 82 30
were 1 82 30
beyond 1 82 30
the 1 82 30
pale. 1 82 30

BDS 0 82 31
activists 0 82 31
generally 0 82 31
avoid 0 82 31
reference 0 82 31
to 0 82 31
“Jews” 0 82 31
by 0 82 31
name 0 82 31
because 0 82 31
it 0 82 31
is 0 82 31
impolitic 0 82 31
and 0 82 31
commonly 0 82 31
substitute 0 82 31
“Zionists” 0 82 31
for 0 82 31
Jews 0 82 31
even 0 82 31
though 0 82 31
most 0 82 31
of 0 82 31
us 0 82 31
are 0 82 31
cognizant 0 82 31
of 0 82 31
their 0 82 31
true 0 82 31
intentions. 0 82 31

But 0 82 32
in 0 82 32
the 0 82 32
instant 0 82 32
case, 0 82 32
McGill’s 0 82 32
BDS 0 82 32
campaigners 0 82 32
dispensed 0 82 32
with 0 82 32
their 0 82 32
traditional 0 82 32
charade 1 82 32
and 0 82 32
overtly 0 82 32
launched 0 82 32
their 0 82 32
attack 0 82 32
against 0 82 32
Jews. 0 82 32

The 1 82 33
vitriolic 1 82 33
BDS 1 82 33
campaign 1 82 33
immediately 0 82 33
sparked 1 82 33
outrage 1 82 33
among 0 82 33
watchdog 0 82 33
groups 0 82 33
and 0 82 33
politicians 0 82 33
prompting 0 82 33
McGill 0 82 33
principal, 0 82 33
Suzanne 0 82 33
Fortier, 0 82 33
to 0 82 33
announce 0 82 33
that 0 82 33
the 0 82 33

would 0 82 33
be 0 82 33
conducting 0 82 33
an 0 82 33
investigation 0 82 33
into 0 82 33
the 0 82 33
matter. 0 82 33

Even 0 82 34
SSMU 0 82 34
president, 0 82 34
Muna 0 82 34
Tojiboeva, 0 82 34
voiced 0 82 34
support 0 82 34
for 0 82 34
Lew 0 82 34
and 0 82 34
expressed 0 82 34
the 0 82 34
belief 0 82 34
that 0 82 34
antisemitism 0 82 34
played 0 82 34
a 0 82 34
key 0 82 34
role 0 82 34
in 0 82 34
the 0 82 34
ousting 0 82 34

One 0 82 35
can 0 82 35
only 0 82 35
hope 0 82 35
that 0 82 35
Fortier 0 82 35
takes 0 82 35
the 0 82 35
issue 0 82 35
seriously 0 82 35
and 0 82 35
conducts 0 82 35
a 0 82 35
proper 0 82 35

The 0 85 5
article 0 85 5
recounted 0 85 5
a 0 85 5
claim 0 85 5
by 0 85 5
Deborah 0 85 5
Ramirez, 0 85 5
a 0 85 5
Yale 0 85 5
classmate 0 85 5
of 0 85 5
Brett 0 85 5
Kavanaugh’s, 0 85 5
concerning 0 85 5
“a 0 85 5
dormitory 0 85 5
party 0 85 5
gone 0 85 5
awry.” 0 85 5
As 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
article 0 85 5
acknowledged, 0 85 5
however, 0 85 5
“her 0 85 5
memories 0 85 5
contained 0 85 5
gaps 0 85 5
because 0 85 5
she 0 85 5
had 0 85 5
been 0 85 5
drinking 0 85 5
at 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
time 0 85 5
of 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
alleged 0 85 5
incident.” 0 85 5
The 0 85 5
article 0 85 5
goes 0 85 5
on 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
say 0 85 5
that 0 85 5
in 0 85 5
her 0 85 5
initial 0 85 5
conversations 0 85 5
with 0 85 5
The 0 85 5
New 0 85 5
Yorker, 0 85 5
Ms. 0 85 5
Ramirez 0 85 5
was 0 85 5
“reluctant 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
characterize 0 85 5
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 5
role 0 85 5
in 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
alleged 0 85 5
incident 0 85 5
with 0 85 5
certainty.” 0 85 5
It 0 85 5
was 0 85 5
only 0 85 5
after 0 85 5
“six 0 85 5
days 0 85 5
of 0 85 5
carefully 0 85 5
assessing 0 85 5

and 0 85 5
consulting 0 85 5
with 0 85 5
her 0 85 5
attorney” 0 85 5
that 0 85 5
Ms. 0 85 5
Ramirez 0 85 5
was 0 85 5
suddenly 0 85 5
able 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
pinpoint 0 85 5
Judge 0 85 5
Kavanaugh 0 85 5
as 0 85 5
having 0 85 5
committed 0 85 5
an 0 85 5
unsavory 0 85 5
act, 0 85 5
even 0 85 5
though 0 85 5
she 0 85 5
admitted 0 85 5
being 0 85 5
“foggy” 0 85 5
at 0 85 5
the 0 85 5
time. 0 85 5

The 0 85 6
New 0 85 6
Yorker 0 85 6
article 0 85 6
also 0 85 6
noted 0 85 6
that 0 85 6
the 0 85 6
magazine 0 85 6
“has 0 85 6
not 0 85 6
confirmed 0 85 6

that 0 85 6

Meanwhile, 0 85 7
the 0 85 7

that 0 85 7
he 0 85 7
had 0 85 7
information 0 85 7
from 0 85 7

that 0 85 7
Judge 0 85 7

his 0 85 7

had 0 85 7

at 0 85 7

Haters 1 85 8
of 1 85 8
Judge 1 85 8

are 0 85 8
turning 0 85 8
the 0 85 8

confirmation 0 85 8
of 0 85 8
a 0 85 8

into 0 85 8
something 0 85 8
worse 1 85 8
than 1 85 8
a 1 85 8
travesty. 1 85 8

His 0 85 9
opponents 0 85 9
in 0 85 9
the 0 85 9

have 0 85 9
transformed 0 85 9
their 0 85 9

into 0 85 9

options 0 85 17
for 0 85 17
her 0 85 17
to 0 85 17
testify 0 85 17
publicly 0 85 17
or 0 85 17
privately 0 85 17
or 0 85 17
to 0 85 17
be 0 85 17
interviewed 0 85 17
by 0 85 17
committee 0 85 17
staff 0 85 17
in 0 85 17
her 0 85 17
home 0 85 17
state 0 85 17
of 0 85 17
California, 0 85 17
whichever 0 85 17
setting 0 85 17
would 0 85 17
make 0 85 17
her 0 85 17
more 0 85 17
comfortable. 0 85 17

However, 0 85 18
in 0 85 18
Senator 0 85 18
Grassley’s 0 85 18
e-mail 0 85 18
thanking 0 85 18
Ms. 0 85 18
Ford 0 85 18
for 0 85 18
finally 0 85 18
agreeing 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
a 0 85 18
time 0 85 18
certain 0 85 18
for 0 85 18
her 0 85 18
testimony, 0 85 18
Senator 0 85 18
Grassley 0 85 18
correctly 0 85 18
reminded 0 85 18
her 0 85 18
attorneys 0 85 18
that 0 85 18
“the 0 85 18
committee 0 85 18
determines 0 85 18
which 0 85 18
witnesses 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
call, 0 85 18
how 0 85 18
many 0 85 18
witnesses 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
call, 0 85 18
and 0 85 18
what 0 85 18
order 0 85 18
to 0 85 18
call 0 85 18
them 0 85 18
and 0 85 18
who 0 85 18
will 0 85 18
question 0 85 18
them. 0 85 18

These 0 85 19
are 0 85 19
nonnegotiable.” 0 85 19

While 0 85 20
the 0 85 20
negotiations 0 85 20
with 0 85 20
Ms. 0 85 20
Ford’s 0 85 20
attorneys 0 85 20
for 0 85 20
her 0 85 20
testimony 0 85 20
were 0 85 20
underway, 0 85 20
Democrats 0 85 20
were 0 85 20
sitting 0 85 20
on 0 85 20
the 0 85 20
latest 0 85 20
allegations, 0 85 20
ready 1 85 20
to 1 85 20
pounce 1 85 20
as 0 85 20
soon 0 85 20
as 0 85 20
Ms. 0 85 20
Ford’s 0 85 20
accusation 0 85 20
was 0 85 20
about 0 85 20
to 0 85 20
be 0 85 20
heard. 0 85 20

Some 0 85 21
Democrats 0 85 21
are 0 85 21
already 0 85 21
using 0 85 21
the 0 85 21
Ramirez 0 85 21
episode 0 85 21
to 0 85 21
push 0 85 21
anew 0 85 21
for 0 85 21
a 0 85 21
fresh 0 85 21
FBI 0 85 21
investigation 0 85 21
and 0 85 21
to 0 85 21
postpone 0 85 21
Thursday’s 0 85 21
scheduled 0 85 21
hearing. 0 85 21

Ideally, 0 85 22
if 0 85 22
the 0 85 22
Democrats 0 85 22
cannot 0 85 22
apply 0 85 22
enough 0 85 22
pressure 0 85 22
to 0 85 22
force 0 85 22
a 0 85 22
withdrawal 0 85 22
of 0 85 22
Judge 0 85 22
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 22
nomination 0 85 22
through 0 85 22
their 0 85 22
relentless 0 85 22
campaign 0 85 22
of 0 85 22
character 1 85 22
assassination, 1 85 22
they 0 85 22
want 0 85 22
to 0 85 22
push 0 85 22
any 0 85 22
Senate 0 85 22
votes 0 85 22
until 0 85 22
after 0 85 22
the 0 85 22
midterm 0 85 22
elections 0 85 22
at 0 85 22
the 0 85 22
earliest. 0 85 22

Then 0 85 23
they 0 85 23
will 0 85 23
claim 0 85 23
that 0 85 23
the 0 85 23
newly 0 85 23
elected 0 85 23
senators 0 85 23
should 0 85 23
be 0 85 23
involved 0 85 23
in 0 85 23
the 0 85 23
confirmation 0 85 23
decision. 0 85 23

In 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
meantime, 0 85 24
Judge 0 85 24
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 24
adversaries 0 85 24
in 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
Senate, 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
mainstream 0 85 24
media 0 85 24
and 0 85 24
progressive 0 85 24
circles 0 85 24
continue 1 85 24
to 1 85 24
bludgeon 1 85 24
Judge 0 85 24
Kavanaugh 0 85 24
in 0 85 24
the 0 85 24
court 0 85 24
of 0 85 24
public 0 85 24
opinion. 0 85 24

All 0 85 25
of 0 85 25
their 0 85 25
stratagems 0 85 25
are 0 85 25
an 0 85 25
obvious 0 85 25
attempt 0 85 25
to 0 85 25
buy 0 85 25
time 0 85 25
in 0 85 25
order 0 85 25
to 0 85 25
persuade 0 85 25
any 0 85 25
wavering 0 85 25
senators 0 85 25
that 0 85 25
Judge 0 85 25
Kavanaugh 0 85 25
is 0 85 25
too 0 85 25
tainted 0 85 25
by 0 85 25
sexual 0 85 25
assault 0 85 25
charges 0 85 25
– 0 85 25
whether 0 85 25
proven 0 85 25
or 0 85 25
not 0 85 25
- 0 85 25
to 0 85 25
sit 0 85 25
on 0 85 25
the 0 85 25
Supreme 0 85 25
Court. 0 85 25

Proof 0 85 26
does 0 85 26
not 0 85 26
matter 0 85 26
to 0 85 26
those 0 85 26
wanting 0 85 26
to 0 85 26
bring 0 85 26
Judge 0 85 26
Kavanaugh 0 85 26
down 0 85 26
at 0 85 26
any 0 85 26
cost. 0 85 26

Regarding 0 85 27
Ms. 0 85 27
Ford’s 0 85 27
accusation, 0 85 27
they 0 85 27
know 0 85 27
that 0 85 27
the 0 85 27
proof 0 85 27
so 0 85 27
far 0 85 27
is 0 85 27
non-existent, 0 85 27
aside 0 85 27
from 0 85 27
Ms. 0 85 27
Ford’s 0 85 27
own 0 85 27
assertions 0 85 27

in 0 85 27
her 0 85 27

given 0 85 27
to 0 85 27
Senator 0 85 27

the 0 85 27
Judiciary 0 85 27
Committee, 0 85 27

While 0 85 28
a 0 85 28

version 0 85 28
of 0 85 28
Ms. 0 85 28
Ford’s 0 85 28

has 0 85 28
been 0 85 28
published, 0 85 28
Senator 0 85 28

of 0 85 28
the 0 85 28
completely 0 85 28
unredacted 0 85 28
version. 0 85 28

The 0 85 29
FBI 0 85 29
has 0 85 29
already 0 85 29
conducted 0 85 29
6 0 85 29
background 0 85 29
checks, 0 85 29
no 0 85 29
federal 0 85 29
crime 0 85 29
is 0 85 29
alleged, 0 85 29
and 0 85 29
there 0 85 29
is 0 85 29
no 0 85 29
forensic 0 85 29
evidence 0 85 29
to 0 85 29
investigate 0 85 29
after 0 85 29
30 0 85 29
years 0 85 29
at 0 85 29
a 0 85 29
site 0 85 29
that 0 85 29
Ms. 0 85 29
Ford 0 85 29
cannot 0 85 29
even 0 85 29
identify. 0 85 29

What 1 85 30
we 1 85 30
do 1 85 30
know 1 85 30
so 1 85 30
far 1 85 30
tends 1 85 30
to 1 85 30
undercut 1 85 30
the 1 85 30
credibility 1 85 30
of 1 85 30
Ms. 1 85 30
Ford’s 1 85 30
accusation. 1 85 30

Ms. 0 85 31
Ford 0 85 31
cannot 0 85 31
corroborate 0 85 31
her 0 85 31
decades-old 0 85 31
charge 0 85 31
of 0 85 31
sexual 0 85 31
assault 0 85 31
against 0 85 31
Judge 0 85 31
Kavanaugh. 0 85 31

Whatever 1 85 32
corroboration 1 85 32
Ms. 1 85 32
Ford 1 85 32
was 1 85 32
hoping 1 85 32
for 1 85 32
from 1 85 32
“witnesses” 1 85 32
she 1 85 32
claimed 1 85 32
were 1 85 32
at 1 85 32
the 1 85 32
alleged 1 85 32
party 1 85 32
is 1 85 32
non-existent. 1 85 32

The 0 85 33
individuals 0 85 33
she 0 85 33
reportedly 0 85 33
named 0 85 33
in 0 85 33
her 0 85 33
unredacted 0 85 33
confidential 0 85 33
letter 0 85 33
given 0 85 33
to 0 85 33
Senator 0 85 33
Feinstein 0 85 33
have 0 85 33
either 0 85 33
denied 0 85 33
being 0 85 33
at 0 85 33
such 0 85 33
a 0 85 33
party 0 85 33
or 0 85 33
do 0 85 33
not 0 85 33
recollect 0 85 33
what 0 85 33
Ms. 0 85 33
Ford 0 85 33
has 0 85 33
alleged. 0 85 33

Moreover, 0 85 34
by 0 85 34
her 0 85 34
own 0 85 34
admission 0 85 34
to 0 85 34
the 0 85 34
Washington 0 85 34
Post, 0 85 34
Ms. 0 85 34
Ford 0 85 34
“said 0 85 34
she 0 85 34
does 0 85 34
not 0 85 34
remember 0 85 34
some 0 85 34
key 0 85 34
details 0 85 34
of 0 85 34
the 0 85 34
incident.” 0 85 34
She 0 85 34
does 0 85 34
not 0 85 34
remember, 0 85 34
for 0 85 34
example, 0 85 34
where 0 85 34
it 0 85 34
happened, 0 85 34
how 0 85 34
the 0 85 34
party 0 85 34
came 0 85 34
together 0 85 34
in 0 85 34
the 0 85 34
first 0 85 34
place, 0 85 34
or 0 85 34
how 0 85 34
she 0 85 34
got 0 85 34
home 0 85 34
after 0 85 34
the 0 85 34
alleged 0 85 34
incident. 0 85 34

She 0 85 35
believes 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
alleged 0 85 35
incident 0 85 35
occurred 0 85 35
during 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
summer 0 85 35
of 0 85 35
1982, 0 85 35
but 0 85 35
reportedly 0 85 35
could 0 85 35
not 0 85 35
be 0 85 35
more 0 85 35
precise 0 85 35
on 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
day 0 85 35
or 0 85 35
even 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
month 0 85 35
of 0 85 35
the 0 85 35
party. 0 85 35

Afraid 0 85 36
that 0 85 36
Ms. 0 85 36
Ford’s 0 85 36
sexual 0 85 36
assault 0 85 36
allegation 0 85 36
could 0 85 36
be 0 85 36
readily 0 85 36
challenged 0 85 36
and 0 85 36
anxious 0 85 36
to 0 85 36
establish 0 85 36
some 0 85 36
sort 0 85 36
of 0 85 36
pattern 0 85 36
of 0 85 36
sexual 0 85 36
misconduct 0 85 36
beyond 0 85 36
this 0 85 36
single 0 85 36
alleged 0 85 36
incident, 0 85 36
the 1 85 36
Kavanaugh 1 85 36
haters 1 85 36
have 0 85 36
latched 0 85 36
onto 0 85 36
Ms. 0 85 36
Ramirez’s 0 85 36
story. 0 85 36

The 0 85 37
New 0 85 37
York 0 85 37
Times 0 85 37
published 0 85 37
an 0 85 37
op-ed 0 85 37
column 0 85 37
last 0 85 37
week 0 85 37
by 0 85 37
a 0 85 37
psychiatrist, 0 85 37
Richard 0 85 37
A. 0 85 37
Friedman, 0 85 37
who 0 85 37
cited 0 85 37
neurological 0 85 37
science 0 85 37
to 0 85 37
conclude 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
Ms. 0 85 37
Ford’s 0 85 37
claim 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
she 0 85 37
has 0 85 37
“a 0 85 37
vivid 0 85 37
memory 0 85 37
of 0 85 37
an 0 85 37
attack 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
took 0 85 37
place 0 85 37
when 0 85 37
she 0 85 37
was 0 85 37
15” 0 85 37
is 0 85 37
“credible.” 0 85 37
The 0 85 37
reason, 0 85 37
he 0 85 37
wrote, 0 85 37
is 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
“memories 0 85 37
formed 0 85 37
under 0 85 37
the 0 85 37
influence 0 85 37
of 0 85 37
intense 0 85 37
emotion 0 85 37
— 0 85 37
such 0 85 37
as 0 85 37
the 0 85 37
feelings 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
accompany 0 85 37
a 0 85 37
sexual 0 85 37
assault 0 85 37
— 0 85 37
are 0 85 37
indelible 0 85 37
in 0 85 37
the 0 85 37
way 0 85 37
that 0 85 37
memories 0 85 37
of 0 85 37
a 0 85 37
routine 0 85 37
day 0 85 37
are 0 85 37
not.” 0 85 37
The 1 85 37
only 1 85 37
problem 1 85 37
with 1 85 37
Dr. 1 85 37
Friedman’s 1 85 37
thesis 1 85 37
is 1 85 37
that 1 85 37
Ms. 1 85 37
Ford 1 85 37
has 1 85 37
apparently 1 85 37
forgotten 1 85 37
such 1 85 37
key 1 85 37
details 1 85 37
surrounding 1 85 37
the 1 85 37
alleged 1 85 37
sexual 1 85 37
assault 1 85 37
as 1 85 37
when 1 85 37
and 1 85 37
where 1 85 37
it 1 85 37
happened 1 85 37
and 1 85 37
how 1 85 37
she 1 85 37
got 1 85 37
home. 1 85 37

Moreover, 0 85 38
when 0 85 38
Ms. 0 85 38
Ford 0 85 38
finally 0 85 38
told 0 85 38
someone 0 85 38
about 0 85 38
the 0 85 38
incident 0 85 38
in 0 85 38
any 0 85 38
detail 0 85 38
some 0 85 38
30 0 85 38
years 0 85 38
later 0 85 38
in 0 85 38
2012, 0 85 38
during 0 85 38
a 0 85 38
couples 0 85 38
therapy 0 85 38
session 0 85 38
with 0 85 38
her 0 85 38
husband, 0 85 38
she 0 85 38
did 0 85 38
not 0 85 38
name 0 85 38
Judge 0 85 38
Kavanaugh 0 85 38
specifically, 0 85 38
according 0 85 38
to 0 85 38
the 0 85 38
therapist’s 0 85 38
notes 0 85 38
that 0 85 38
Ms. 0 85 38
Ford 0 85 38
had 0 85 38
provided 0 85 38
to 0 85 38

The 0 85 39
Washington 0 85 39

reported 0 85 39
that 0 85 39

reported 0 85 39
that 0 85 39

Ms. 0 85 40
Ramirez’s 0 85 40
story 0 85 40
is 0 85 40
even 0 85 40
less 0 85 40
credible. 0 85 40

It 0 85 41
took 0 85 41
an 0 85 41
attorney 0 85 41
and 0 85 41
six 0 85 41
days 0 85 41
of 0 85 41
very 0 85 41
belated 0 85 41
reflection 0 85 41
to 0 85 41
help 0 85 41
revive 0 85 41
her 0 85 41
memory 0 85 41
of 0 85 41
an 0 85 41
incident 0 85 41
she 0 85 41
claimed 0 85 41
happened 0 85 41
while 0 85 41
she 0 85 41
herself 0 85 41
was 0 85 41
very 0 85 41
drunk. 0 85 41

Senator 0 85 42
Mazie 0 85 42
Hirono 0 85 42
(D-Hawaii), 0 85 42
one 0 85 42
of 0 85 42
Judge 0 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 42
fiercest 0 85 42
critics 0 85 42
who 0 85 42
told 0 85 42
men 0 85 42
to 0 85 42
“shut 0 85 42
up” 0 85 42
regarding 0 85 42
Ms. 0 85 42
Ford’s 0 85 42
allegations, 0 85 42
said 0 85 42
she 1 85 42
doubts 1 85 42
Judge 1 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 1 85 42
credibility 1 85 42
because 1 85 42
of 1 85 42
“how 1 85 42
he 1 85 42
approaches 1 85 42
his 1 85 42
cases.” 1 85 42
Aside 0 85 42
from 0 85 42
mischaracterizing 0 85 42
the 0 85 42
constitutional 0 85 42
textualist 0 85 42
reasoning 0 85 42
underlying 0 85 42
Judge 0 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 42
opinions, 0 85 42
she 0 85 42
is 0 85 42
saying 0 85 42
that 0 85 42
she 0 85 42
does 0 85 42
not 0 85 42
believe 0 85 42
Judge 0 85 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 42
denial 0 85 42
of 0 85 42
the 0 85 42
sexual 0 85 42
misconduct 0 85 42
allegations 0 85 42
lodged 0 85 42
against 0 85 42
him 0 85 42
because 0 85 42
of 0 85 42
the 0 85 42
opinions 0 85 42
he 0 85 42
wrote 0 85 42
that 0 85 42
she 0 85 42
does 0 85 42
not 0 85 42
like. 0 85 42

Such 0 85 43
circular 0 85 43
“reasoning” 0 85 43
would 0 85 43
be 0 85 43
amusing 0 85 43
if 0 85 43
it 0 85 43
were 0 85 43
not 0 85 43
so 0 85 43
emblematic 0 85 43
of 0 85 43
what 0 85 43
one 0 85 43
writer 0 85 43
called 0 85 43
“Kavanaugh 1 85 43
Derangement 1 85 43
Syndrome." 1 85 43

Senator 0 85 44
Kirsten 0 85 44
Gillibrand 0 85 44
(D-N.Y.) 0 85 44
is 0 85 44
also 0 85 44
suffering 0 85 44
from 0 85 44
the 0 85 44
same 0 85 44
syndrome. 0 85 44

She 0 85 45
said 0 85 45
Thursday 0 85 45
regarding 0 85 45
Ms. 0 85 45
Ford: 0 85 45
"I 0 85 45
believe 1 85 45
her 1 85 45
because 1 85 45
she 1 85 45
is 1 85 45
telling 1 85 45
the 1 85 45
truth 1 85 45
and 1 85 45
you 1 85 45
know 1 85 45
it 1 85 45
by 1 85 45
her 1 85 45
story." 1 85 45

Ms. 0 85 46
Ford’s 0 85 46
supporters 0 85 46
are 0 85 46
exploiting 0 85 46
the 0 85 46
“Me 1 85 46
Too” 1 85 46
movement 1 85 46
to 0 85 46
declare 0 85 46
Judge 0 85 46
Kavanaugh 0 85 46
guilty 0 85 46
simply 1 85 46
because 1 85 46
Ms. 1 85 46
Ford 1 85 46
is 1 85 46
a 1 85 46
woman 1 85 46
who 1 85 46
has 1 85 46
made 1 85 46
what 1 85 46
they 1 85 46
call, 1 85 46
without 1 85 46
any 1 85 46
corroborating 1 85 46
evidence 1 85 46
to 1 85 46
date, 1 85 46
a 1 85 46
“credible” 1 85 46
charge. 1 85 46

The 0 85 47
same 0 85 47
would 0 85 47
presumably 0 85 47
be 0 85 47
the 0 85 47
case 0 85 47
for 0 85 47
Ms. 0 85 47
Ramirez. 0 85 47

They 0 85 48
argue 0 85 48
that 0 85 48
since 0 85 48
the 0 85 48
Senate 0 85 48
Judiciary 0 85 48
Committee 0 85 48
is 0 85 48
not 0 85 48
a 0 85 48
criminal 0 85 48
judicial 0 85 48
trial, 0 85 48
but 0 85 48
rather 0 85 48
a 0 85 48
legislative 0 85 48
hearing 0 85 48
for 0 85 48
confirmation 0 85 48
of 0 85 48
a 0 85 48
Supreme 0 85 48
Court 0 85 48
nominee, 0 85 48
the 0 85 48
normal 0 85 48
burden 0 85 48
of 0 85 48
proof 0 85 48
shouldered 0 85 48
by 0 85 48
the 0 85 48
accuser 0 85 48
should 0 85 48
not 0 85 48
apply. 0 85 48

Judge 0 85 49
Kavanaugh 0 85 49
should 0 85 49
have 0 85 49
to 0 85 49
prove 0 85 49
that 0 85 49
he 0 85 49
is 0 85 49
not 0 85 49
guilty, 0 85 49
they 0 85 49
are 0 85 49
in 0 85 49
effect 0 85 49
insisting. 0 85 49

This 0 85 50
is 0 85 50
another 0 85 50
case 0 85 50
of 0 85 50
Kavanaugh 1 85 50
Derangement 1 85 50
Syndrome. 1 85 50

Let’s 0 85 51
assume 0 85 51
for 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
sake 0 85 51
of 0 85 51
argument 0 85 51
that 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
normal 0 85 51
burden 0 85 51
on 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
prosecution 0 85 51
in 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
criminal 0 85 51
case 0 85 51
- 0 85 51
to 0 85 51
prove 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
accused’s 0 85 51
guilt 0 85 51
beyond 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
reasonable 0 85 51
doubt 0 85 51
- 0 85 51
is 0 85 51
not 0 85 51
applicable 0 85 51
regarding 0 85 51
the 0 85 51
charge 0 85 51
against 0 85 51
Judge 0 85 51
Kavanaugh 0 85 51
since 0 85 51
he 0 85 51
is 0 85 51
not 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
defendant 0 85 51
in 0 85 51
a 0 85 51
criminal 0 85 51
trial. 0 85 51

However, 0 85 52
that 0 85 52
should 0 85 52
not 0 85 52
flip 0 85 52
the 0 85 52
burden 0 85 52
of 0 85 52
proof 0 85 52
onto 0 85 52
Judge 0 85 52
Kavanaugh 0 85 52
altogether. 0 85 52

Judge 0 85 53
Kavanaugh 0 85 53
is 0 85 53
being 0 85 53
subjected 0 85 53
to 0 85 53
charges 0 85 53
of 0 85 53
a 0 85 53
criminal 0 85 53
nature 0 85 53
that 0 85 53
could 0 85 53
not 0 85 53
only 0 85 53
deprive 0 85 53
him 0 85 53
of 0 85 53
a 0 85 53
seat 0 85 53
on 0 85 53
the 0 85 53
Supreme 0 85 53
Court 0 85 53
for 0 85 53
which 0 85 53
he 0 85 53
is 0 85 53
otherwise 0 85 53
eminently 0 85 53
qualified. 0 85 53

Ms. 0 85 54
Ford’s 0 85 54
unsubstantiated 0 85 54
accusation 0 85 54
can 0 85 54
completely 1 85 54
destroy 1 85 54
Judge 1 85 54
Kavanaugh’s 1 85 54
life 1 85 54
by 0 85 54
causing 0 85 54
irreparable 0 85 54
damage 0 85 54
to 0 85 54
his 0 85 54
reputation 0 85 54
for 0 85 54
integrity 0 85 54
and 0 85 54
good 0 85 54
character 0 85 54
and 0 85 54
to 0 85 54
his 0 85 54
career, 0 85 54
which 0 85 54
he 0 85 54
has 0 85 54
built 0 85 54
up 0 85 54
during 0 85 54
decades 0 85 54
of 0 85 54
public 0 85 54
service. 0 85 54

His 0 85 55
family’s 0 85 55
lives 0 85 55
have 0 85 55
been 0 85 55
completely 0 85 55
upended. 0 85 55

Placing 0 85 56
the 0 85 56
burden 0 85 56
on 0 85 56
Judge 0 85 56
Kavanaugh 0 85 56
to 0 85 56
prove 0 85 56
that 0 85 56
he 0 85 56
was 0 85 56
not 0 85 56
involved 0 85 56
in 0 85 56
an 0 85 56
uncorroborated 0 85 56
incident 0 85 56
from 0 85 56
years 0 85 56
ago, 0 85 56
about 0 85 56
which 0 85 56
even 0 85 56
his 0 85 56
accuser 0 85 56
does 0 85 56
not 0 85 56
recall 0 85 56
key 0 85 56
details, 0 85 56
turns 1 85 56
the 1 85 56
fundamental 1 85 56
constitutional 1 85 56
principle 1 85 56
of 1 85 56
due 1 85 56
process 1 85 56
upside 1 85 56
down. 1 85 56

Ms. 0 85 57
Ford 0 85 57
should 0 85 57
have 0 85 57
the 0 85 57
burden 0 85 57
to 0 85 57
prove 0 85 57
her 0 85 57
accusations 0 85 57
by 0 85 57
at 0 85 57
least 0 85 57
a 0 85 57
preponderance 0 85 57
of 0 85 57
all 0 85 57
the 0 85 57
evidence 0 85 57
presented. 0 85 57

This 1 85 58
charade 1 85 58
must 0 85 58
come 0 85 58
to 0 85 58
an 0 85 58
end. 0 85 58

No 0 85 59
more 0 85 59
extensions 0 85 59
for 0 85 59
Ms. 0 85 59
Ford 0 85 59
to 0 85 59
come 0 85 59
forward 0 85 59
and 0 85 59
testify. 0 85 59

If 0 85 60
Ms. 0 85 60
Ford 0 85 60
does 0 85 60
not 0 85 60
follow 0 85 60
through 0 85 60
with 0 85 60
her 0 85 60
agreement 0 85 60
to 0 85 60
testify 0 85 60
in 0 85 60
an 0 85 60
open 0 85 60
Senate 0 85 60
Judiciary 0 85 60
Committee 0 85 60
hearing 0 85 60
this 0 85 60
Thursday 0 85 60
and 0 85 60
do 0 85 60
so 0 85 60
upon 0 85 60
the 0 85 60
conditions 0 85 60
set 0 85 60
by 0 85 60
the 0 85 60
committee, 0 85 60
she 0 85 60
should 0 85 60
go 0 85 60
home 0 85 60
while 0 85 60
the 0 85 60
committee 0 85 60
proceeds 0 85 60
to 0 85 60
an 0 85 60
immediate 0 85 60
vote 0 85 60
on 0 85 60
Judge 0 85 60
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 60
nomination. 0 85 60

If 0 85 61
Ms. 0 85 61
Ford 0 85 61
and 0 85 61
Judge 0 85 61
Kavanaugh 0 85 61
do 0 85 61
testify, 0 85 61
the 0 85 61
senators 0 85 61
deciding 0 85 61
on 0 85 61
whether 0 85 61
to 0 85 61
confirm 0 85 61
Judge 0 85 61
Kavanaugh 0 85 61
as 0 85 61
well 0 85 61
as 0 85 61
the 0 85 61
American 0 85 61
public 0 85 61
following 0 85 61
the 0 85 61
testimony 0 85 61
must 0 85 61
remember 0 85 61
one 0 85 61
cardinal 0 85 61
rule. 0 85 61

In 1 85 62
a 1 85 62
nation 1 85 62
guided 1 85 62
by 1 85 62
fairness 1 85 62
and 1 85 62
law, 1 85 62
a 1 85 62
person 1 85 62
is 1 85 62
innocent 1 85 62
until 1 85 62
proven 1 85 62
guilty. 1 85 62

Sadly, 0 85 63
many 0 85 63
of 0 85 63
Judge 1 85 63
Kavanaugh’s 1 85 63
haters 1 85 63
have 0 85 63
thrown 0 85 63
that 0 85 63
rule 0 85 63
aside. 0 85 63

If 0 85 64
Judge 0 85 64
Kavanaugh’s 0 85 64
nomination 0 85 64
is 0 85 64
pulled 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
a 0 85 64
result 0 85 64
of 0 85 64
the 0 85 64
smears 1 85 64
and 0 85 64
character 1 85 64
assassination, 1 85 64
President 0 85 64
Trump 0 85 64
should 0 85 64
immediately 0 85 64
nominate 0 85 64
someone 0 85 64
on 0 85 64
his 0 85 64
short 0 85 64
list 0 85 64
such 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
Amy 0 85 64
Coney 0 85 64
Barrett 0 85 64
and 0 85 64
the 0 85 64
Senate 0 85 64
Republican 0 85 64
majority 0 85 64
should 0 85 64
then 0 85 64
push 0 85 64
through 0 85 64
the 0 85 64
new 0 85 64
nominee’s 0 85 64
confirmation 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
soon 0 85 64
as 0 85 64
possible. 0 85 64

Delay 0 85 65
is 0 85 65
not 0 85 65
an 0 85 65
option. 0 85 65

The 0 86 13
allegations 0 86 13
against 0 86 13
Brett 0 86 13
Kavanaugh 0 86 13
— 0 86 13
outlined 0 86 13

on 0 86 13

are 0 86 13
substantial 0 86 13
and 0 86 13
serious. 0 86 13

She 0 86 14
claims 0 86 14
that 0 86 14
Kavanaugh 0 86 14
knocked 0 86 14
her 0 86 14
down, 0 86 14
groped 0 86 14
her, 0 86 14
and 0 86 14
attempted 0 86 14
to 0 86 14
remove 0 86 14
her 0 86 14
clothes. 0 86 14

Here’s 0 86 15
the 0 86 15
core 0 86 15
of 0 86 15
her 0 86 15
story: 0 86 15

While 0 86 16
his 0 86 16
friend 0 86 16
watched, 0 86 16
she 0 86 16
said, 0 86 16
Kavanaugh 0 86 16
pinned 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
to 0 86 16
a 0 86 16
bed 0 86 16
on 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
back 0 86 16
and 0 86 16
groped 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
over 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
clothes, 0 86 16
grinding 0 86 16
his 0 86 16
body 0 86 16
against 0 86 16
hers 0 86 16
and 0 86 16
clumsily 0 86 16
attempting 0 86 16
to 0 86 16
pull 0 86 16
off 0 86 16
her 0 86 16
one-piece 0 86 16
bathing 0 86 16
suit 0 86 16
and 0 86 16
the 0 86 16
clothing 0 86 16
she 0 86 16
wore 0 86 16
over 0 86 16
it. 0 86 16

When 0 86 17
she 0 86 17
tried 0 86 17
to 0 86 17
scream, 0 86 17
she 0 86 17
said, 0 86 17
he 0 86 17
put 0 86 17
his 0 86 17
hand 0 86 17
over 0 86 17
her 0 86 17
mouth. 0 86 17

“I 0 86 18
thought 0 86 18
he 0 86 18
might 0 86 18
inadvertently 0 86 18
kill 0 86 18
me,” 0 86 18
said 0 86 18
Ford, 0 86 18
now 0 86 18
a 0 86 18
51-year-old 0 86 18
research 0 86 18
psychologist 0 86 18
in 0 86 18
northern 0 86 18
California. 0 86 18

“He 0 86 19
was 0 86 19
trying 0 86 19
to 0 86 19
attack 0 86 19
me 0 86 19
and 0 86 19
remove 0 86 19
my 0 86 19
clothing.” 0 86 19
Ford 0 86 19
said 0 86 19
she 0 86 19
was 0 86 19
able 0 86 19
to 0 86 19
escape 0 86 19
when 0 86 19
Kavanaugh’s 0 86 19
friend 0 86 19
and 0 86 19
classmate 0 86 19
at 0 86 19
Georgetown 0 86 19
Preparatory 0 86 19
School, 0 86 19
Mark 0 86 19
Judge, 0 86 19
jumped 0 86 19
on 0 86 19
top 0 86 19
of 0 86 19
them, 0 86 19
sending 0 86 19
all 0 86 19
three 0 86 19
tumbling. 0 86 19

She 0 86 20
said 0 86 20
she 0 86 20
ran 0 86 20
from 0 86 20
the 0 86 20
room, 0 86 20
briefly 0 86 20
locked 0 86 20
herself 0 86 20
in 0 86 20
a 0 86 20
bathroom 0 86 20
and 0 86 20
then 0 86 20
fled 0 86 20
the 0 86 20
house. 0 86 20

Do 0 86 21
not 0 86 21
count 0 86 21
me 0 86 21
among 0 86 21
those 0 86 21
who 0 86 21
would 0 86 21
minimize 0 86 21
this 0 86 21
alleged 0 86 21
assault. 0 86 21

I 0 86 22
went 0 86 22
to 0 86 22
a 0 86 22
high 0 86 22
school 0 86 22
that 0 86 22
had 0 86 22
more 0 86 22
than 0 86 22
its 0 86 22
share 0 86 22
of 0 86 22
drunken 0 86 22
parties, 0 86 22
and 0 86 22
my 0 86 22
classmates 0 86 22
could 0 86 22
do 0 86 22
crazy 0 86 22
and 0 86 22
stupid 0 86 22
things, 0 86 22
but 0 86 22
an 0 86 22
act 0 86 22
like 0 86 22
this 0 86 22
was 0 86 22
beyond 0 86 22
the 0 86 22
pale. 0 86 22

This 0 86 23
isn’t 0 86 23
“boys 1 86 23
will 1 86 23
be 1 86 23
boys.” 1 86 23
Actions 0 86 23
have 0 86 23
consequences, 0 86 23
and 0 86 23
it’s 0 86 23
hardly 0 86 23
unjust 0 86 23
to 0 86 23
tell 0 86 23
a 0 86 23
person 0 86 23
that 0 86 23
if 0 86 23
he 0 86 23
mistreated 0 86 23
another 0 86 23
human 0 86 23
being 0 86 23
like 0 86 23
this 0 86 23
— 0 86 23
even 0 86 23
a 0 86 23
long 0 86 23
time 0 86 23
ago 0 86 23
— 0 86 23
he 0 86 23
has 0 86 23
to 0 86 23
remain 0 86 23
“merely” 0 86 23
a 0 86 23
judge 0 86 23
on 0 86 23
the 0 86 23
D.C. 0 86 23

Circuit 0 86 24
Court 0 86 24
of 0 86 24
Appeals. 0 86 24

Since 0 86 25
Kavanaugh 0 86 25
has 0 86 25
denied 0 86 25
the 0 86 25
story, 0 86 25
however, 0 86 25
the 0 86 25
question 0 86 25
of 0 86 25
whether 0 86 25
the 0 86 25
event 0 86 25
is 0 86 25
so 0 86 25
egregious 0 86 25
that 0 86 25
it 0 86 25
should 0 86 25
disqualify 0 86 25
him 0 86 25
is 0 86 25
moot. 0 86 25

At 0 86 26
the 0 86 26
very 0 86 26
least, 0 86 26
if 0 86 26
the 0 86 26
attack 0 86 26
happened, 0 86 26
he 0 86 26
should 0 86 26
be 0 86 26
disqualified 0 86 26
for 0 86 26
lying. 0 86 26

Yet 0 86 27
unless 0 86 27
all 0 86 27
parties 0 86 27
start 0 86 27
telling 0 86 27
the 0 86 27
same 0 86 27
story, 0 86 27
there 0 86 27
is 0 86 27
no 0 86 27
way 0 86 27
to 0 86 27
know 0 86 27
for 0 86 27
certain 0 86 27
if 0 86 27
this 0 86 27
event 0 86 27
occurred. 0 86 27

We 0 86 28
don’t 0 86 28
need 0 86 28
certainty, 0 86 28
however, 0 86 28
to 0 86 28
make 0 86 28
a 0 86 28
decision 0 86 28
on 0 86 28
whether 0 86 28
a 0 86 28
man 0 86 28
should 0 86 28
sit 0 86 28
on 0 86 28
the 0 86 28
Supreme 0 86 28
Court. 0 86 28

I 0 86 29
have 0 86 29
the 0 86 29
same 0 86 29
standard 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Brett 0 86 29
Kavanaugh 0 86 29
as 0 86 29
I 0 86 29
did 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Roy 0 86 29
Moore, 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Donald 0 86 29
Trump, 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
Bill 0 86 29
Clinton 0 86 29
— 0 86 29
or 0 86 29
for 0 86 29
any 0 86 29
other 0 86 29
politician 0 86 29
who’s 0 86 29
accused 0 86 29
of 0 86 29
misconduct. 0 86 29

Is 0 86 30
it 0 86 30
more 0 86 30
likely 0 86 30
than 0 86 30
not 0 86 30
that 0 86 30
the 0 86 30
allegation 0 86 30
is 0 86 30
true? 0 86 30

Given 0 86 31
the 0 86 31
totality 0 86 31
of 0 86 31
the 0 86 31
evidence, 0 86 31
I 0 86 31
believe 0 86 31
it 0 86 31
is 0 86 31
more 0 86 31
likely 0 86 31
than 0 86 31
not 0 86 31
that 0 86 31
Bill 0 86 31
Clinton 0 86 31
committed 0 86 31
rape 0 86 31
and 0 86 31
sexual 0 86 31
harassment. 0 86 31

I 0 86 32
believe 0 86 32
it 0 86 32
is 0 86 32
more 0 86 32
likely 0 86 32
than 0 86 32
not 0 86 32
that 0 86 32
Donald 0 86 32
Trump 0 86 32
has 0 86 32
committed 0 86 32
sexual 0 86 32
assault. 0 86 32

I 0 86 33
believe 0 86 33
it 0 86 33
is 0 86 33
more 0 86 33
likely 0 86 33
than 0 86 33
not 0 86 33
that 0 86 33
Roy 0 86 33
Moore 0 86 33
engaged 0 86 33
in 0 86 33
sexual 0 86 33
misconduct 0 86 33
with 0 86 33
underage 0 86 33
girls. 0 86 33

But 0 86 34
the 0 86 34
evidence 0 86 34
against 0 86 34
Kavanaugh 0 86 34
falls 0 86 34
far 0 86 34
short 0 86 34
of 0 86 34
the 0 86 34
evidence 0 86 34
arrayed 0 86 34
against 0 86 34
each 0 86 34
of 0 86 34
these 0 86 34
men. 0 86 34

So 0 86 35
far 0 86 35
at 0 86 35
least 0 86 35
it 1 86 35
falls 1 86 35
far 1 86 35
short 1 86 35
of 1 86 35
the 1 86 35
evidence 1 86 35
against 1 86 35
virtually 1 86 35
any 1 86 35
other 1 86 35
politician 1 86 35
or 1 86 35
celebrity 1 86 35
who 1 86 35
has 1 86 35
faced 1 86 35
consequences 1 86 35
during 0 86 35
this 0 86 35
#MeToo 0 86 35
moment. 0 86 35

Here’s 0 86 36
why: 0 86 36

First, 0 86 37
one 0 86 37
way 0 86 37
to 0 86 37
help 0 86 37
test 0 86 37
the 0 86 37
veracity 0 86 37
of 0 86 37
old 0 86 37
claims 0 86 37
is 0 86 37
to 0 86 37
ask 0 86 37
whether 0 86 37
there 0 86 37
is 0 86 37
any 0 86 37
contemporaneous 0 86 37
corroboration. 0 86 37

Did 0 86 38
the 0 86 38
accuser 0 86 38
tell 0 86 38
a 0 86 38
friend 0 86 38
or 0 86 38
family 0 86 38
member 0 86 38
or 0 86 38
anyone 0 86 38
about 0 86 38
the 0 86 38
alleged 0 86 38
assault 0 86 38
when 0 86 38
it 0 86 38
occurred? 0 86 38

With 0 86 39
Clinton, 0 86 39
Trump, 0 86 39
Moore, 0 86 39
and 0 86 39
many 0 86 39
other 0 86 39
politicians 0 86 39
and 0 86 39
celebrities, 0 86 39
there 0 86 39
was 0 86 39
ample 0 86 39
contemporaneous 0 86 39
corroboration. 0 86 39

Here, 0 86 40
there 0 86 40
was 0 86 40
not. 0 86 40

According 0 86 41
to 0 86 41
the 0 86 41
Washington 0 86 41
Post, 0 86 41
“Ford 0 86 41
said 0 86 41
she 0 86 41
told 0 86 41
no 0 86 41
one 0 86 41
of 0 86 41
the 0 86 41
incident 0 86 41
in 0 86 41
any 0 86 41
detail 0 86 41
until 0 86 41
2012, 0 86 41
when 0 86 41
she 0 86 41
was 0 86 41
in 0 86 41
couples 0 86 41
therapy 0 86 41
with 0 86 41
her 0 86 41
husband.” 0 86 41

That’s 0 86 42
almost 0 86 42
three 0 86 42
decades 0 86 42
of 0 86 42
silence 0 86 42
— 0 86 42
three 0 86 42
decades 0 86 42
when 0 86 42
memories 0 86 42
can 0 86 42
grow 0 86 42
cloudy 0 86 42
and 0 86 42
recollections 0 86 42
can 0 86 42
change. 0 86 42

But 0 86 43
even 0 86 43
the 0 86 43
allegedly 0 86 43
corroborating 0 86 43
notes 0 86 43
of 0 86 43
the 0 86 43
therapist 0 86 43
raise 0 86 43
a 0 86 43
separate 0 86 43
problem. 0 86 43

They 0 86 44
actually 0 86 44
contradict 0 86 44
her 0 86 44
story 0 86 44
on 0 86 44
a 0 86 44
key 0 86 44
detail. 0 86 44

According 0 86 45
to 0 86 45
the 0 86 45
Post, 0 86 45
“The 0 86 45
notes 0 86 45
say 0 86 45
four 0 86 45
boys 0 86 45
were 0 86 45
involved, 0 86 45
a 0 86 45
discrepancy 0 86 45
that 0 86 45
Ford 0 86 45
says 0 86 45
was 0 86 45
an 0 86 45
error 0 86 45
on 0 86 45
the 0 86 45
therapist’s 0 86 45
part. 0 86 45

Ford 0 86 46
said 0 86 46
there 0 86 46
were 0 86 46
four 0 86 46
boys 0 86 46
at 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
party 0 86 46
but 0 86 46
only 0 86 46
two 0 86 46
in 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
room.” 0 86 46
Nor 0 86 46
do 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
notes 0 86 46
mention 0 86 46
Kavanaugh’s 0 86 46
name, 0 86 46
even 0 86 46
though 0 86 46
her 0 86 46
husband 0 86 46
says 0 86 46
Ford 0 86 46
named 0 86 46
Kavanaugh 0 86 46
in 0 86 46
the 0 86 46
sessions. 0 86 46

Those 0 86 47
are 0 86 47
important 0 86 47
discrepancies, 0 86 47
and 1 86 47
if 1 86 47
six 1 86 47
years 1 86 47
ago 1 86 47
she 1 86 47
told 1 86 47
the 1 86 47
therapist 1 86 47
four 1 86 47
men 1 86 47
and 1 86 47
says 1 86 47
two 1 86 47
men 1 86 47
now, 1 86 47
that 1 86 47
suggests 1 86 47
that 1 86 47
her 1 86 47
memory 1 86 47
of 1 86 47
the 1 86 47
event 1 86 47
may 1 86 47
be 1 86 47
suspect. 1 86 47

As 0 86 48
a 0 86 48
former 0 86 48
trial 0 86 48
lawyer, 0 86 48
I 1 86 48
can 1 86 48
tell 1 86 48
you 1 86 48
that 1 86 48
while 1 86 48
neither 1 86 48
notes 1 86 48
nor 1 86 48
memories 1 86 48
are 1 86 48
infallible, 1 86 48
in 1 86 48
a 1 86 48
contest 1 86 48
between 1 86 48
contemporaneous 1 86 48
notes 1 86 48
and 1 86 48
later 1 86 48
verbal 1 86 48
testimony 1 86 48
about 1 86 48
those 1 86 48
notes, 1 86 48
the 1 86 48
content 1 86 48
of 1 86 48
the 1 86 48
written 1 86 48
notes 1 86 48
usually 1 86 48
prevails. 1 86 48

Juries 0 86 49
are 0 86 49
extremely 1 86 49
skeptical 1 86 49
of 0 86 49
witnesses 0 86 49
who 0 86 49
contradict 0 86 49
written 0 86 49
notes 0 86 49
— 0 86 49
after 0 86 49
all, 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
notes 0 86 49
are 0 86 49
taken 0 86 49
when 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
words 0 86 49
are 0 86 49
immediate 0 86 49
and 0 86 49
there 0 86 49
isn’t 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
overwhelming 0 86 49
pressure 0 86 49
of 0 86 49
a 0 86 49
trial 0 86 49
to 0 86 49
conform 0 86 49
your 0 86 49
testimony 0 86 49
to 0 86 49
the 0 86 49
desired 0 86 49
outcome. 0 86 49

At 0 86 50
least 0 86 50
the 0 86 50
investigation 0 86 50
seems 0 86 50
somewhat 0 86 50
manageable. 0 86 50

If 0 86 51
there 0 86 51
were 0 86 51
only 0 86 51
four 0 86 51
boys 0 86 51
there, 0 86 51
who 0 86 51
were 0 86 51
the 0 86 51
other 0 86 51
two? 0 86 51

Let’s 0 86 52
hear 0 86 52
from 0 86 52
them. 0 86 52

In 0 86 53
fact, 0 86 53
investigators 0 86 53
should 0 86 53
interview 0 86 53
everyone 0 86 53
else 0 86 53
at 0 86 53
the 0 86 53
party. 0 86 53

Yet 0 86 54
given 0 86 54
all 0 86 54
the 0 86 54
years 0 86 54
that 0 86 54
have 0 86 54
passed, 0 86 54
would 0 86 54
it 0 86 54
be 0 86 54
possible 0 86 54
to 0 86 54
find 0 86 54
anyone 0 86 54
who 0 86 54
remembers 0 86 54
being 0 86 54
at 0 86 54
that 0 86 54
party? 0 86 54

Would 0 86 55
they 0 86 55
remember 0 86 55
any 0 86 55
details 0 86 55
at 0 86 55
all? 0 86 55

If 0 86 56
someone 0 86 56
saw 0 86 56
Kavanaugh 0 86 56
stumbling 1 86 56
drunk 1 86 56
at 0 86 56
the 0 86 56
party, 0 86 56
that 0 86 56
would 0 86 56
obviously 0 86 56
bolster 0 86 56
Ford’s 0 86 56
account. 0 86 56

If 0 86 57
another 0 86 57
attendee 0 86 57
says, 0 86 57
“He 0 86 57
was 0 86 57
totally 0 86 57
sober 0 86 57
and 0 86 57
with 0 86 57
me 0 86 57
the 0 86 57
whole 0 86 57
time,” 0 86 57
that 0 86 57
helps 0 86 57
Kavanaugh. 0 86 57

But 0 86 58
the 0 86 58
odds 0 86 58
of 0 86 58
getting 0 86 58
details 0 86 58
that 0 86 58
precise 0 86 58
are 0 86 58
long 0 86 58
indeed, 0 86 58
and 0 86 58
there 0 86 58
is 0 86 58
always 0 86 58
a 0 86 58
chance 0 86 58
that 0 86 58
a 0 86 58
motivated 0 86 58
classmate 0 86 58
might 0 86 58
lie 0 86 58
— 0 86 58
for 0 86 58
either 0 86 58
person…. 0 86 58

In 0 87 20
his 0 87 20

he 0 87 20
encouraged 0 87 20
those 0 87 20

to 0 87 20
"Free 0 87 20

Batten 0 87 21
echoed 0 87 21
that 0 87 21
sentiment 0 87 21
saying, 0 87 21
“Tommy 0 87 21
Robinson 0 87 21

“Whatever 0 87 22

what 0 87 64

want 0 87 64
to 0 87 64
do. 0 87 64

What 0 87 65
Britain 0 87 65
needs 0 87 65
is 0 87 65
a 0 87 65
return 0 87 65

God 1 87 65

the 0 87 65
One 0 87 65

They 0 87 66
need 0 87 66

Him 0 87 66
more 0 87 66

free, 0 89 2
as 0 89 2
the 0 89 2
neocons 0 89 2
would 0 89 2
have 0 89 2
us 0 89 2
believe. 0 89 2

They 0 89 3
came 0 89 3
over 0 89 3
here 0 89 3
because 0 89 3
we 0 89 3
had 0 89 3
been 0 89 3
killing 0 89 3
Muslims 0 89 3
“over 0 89 3
there” 0 89 3
for 0 89 3
decades. 0 89 3

How 0 89 4
do 0 89 4
we 0 89 4
know 0 89 4
this? 0 89 4

Well, 0 89 5
they 0 89 5
told 0 89 5
us. 0 89 5

Osama 0 89 6
bin 0 89 6
Laden 0 89 6
made 0 89 6
it 0 89 6
clear 0 89 6
why 0 89 6
al-Qaeda 0 89 6
sought 0 89 6
to 0 89 6
attack 0 89 6
the 0 89 6
US. 0 89 6

They 0 89 7
didn’t 0 89 7
like 0 89 7
the 0 89 7
US 0 89 7
taking 0 89 7
sides 0 89 7
in 0 89 7
the 0 89 7
Israel-Palestine 0 89 7
conflict 0 89 7
and 0 89 7
they 0 89 7
didn’t 0 89 7
like 0 89 7
US 0 89 7
troops 0 89 7
on 0 89 7
their 0 89 7
holy 0 89 7
land. 0 89 7

Why 0 89 8
believe 0 89 8
a 0 89 8
terrorist, 0 89 8
some 0 89 8
responded. 0 89 8

As 0 89 9

well-known 0 89 9
in 0 89 9
the 0 89 9

Unfortunately, 0 89 20
it 0 89 20
is 0 89 20
clear 0 89 20
that 0 89 20
Giuliani 0 89 20
never 0 89 20
really 0 89 20
understood 0 89 20
what 0 89 20
I 0 89 20
was 0 89 20
trying 0 89 20
to 0 89 20
tell 0 89 20
him. 0 89 20

Like 0 89 21
the 0 89 21
rest 0 89 21
of 0 89 21
the 0 89 21
neocons, 0 89 21
he 0 89 21
either 0 89 21
doesn’t 0 89 21

doesn’t 0 89 21
want 0 89 21
to 0 89 21
get 0 89 21
it. 0 89 21

In 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
recent 0 89 22
speech 0 89 22
to 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
MeK 0 89 22
– 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
violent 1 89 22
Islamist-Marxist 0 89 22
cult 0 89 22
that 0 89 22
spent 0 89 22
two 0 89 22
decades 0 89 22
on 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
US 0 89 22
terror 0 89 22
watch 0 89 22
list 0 89 22
– 0 89 22
Giuliani 0 89 22
promised 0 89 22
that 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
Trump 0 89 22
Administration 0 89 22
had 0 89 22
made 0 89 22
“regime 0 89 22
change” 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
priority 0 89 22
for 0 89 22
Iran. 0 89 22

He 0 89 23
even 0 89 23
told 0 89 23
the 0 89 23
members 0 89 23
of 0 89 23
that 0 89 23
organization 0 89 23
– 0 89 23
an 0 89 23
organization 0 89 23
that 0 89 23
has 0 89 23
killed 1 89 23
dozens 1 89 23
of 1 89 23
Americans 1 89 23
– 0 89 23
that 0 89 23
Trump 0 89 23
would 0 89 23
put 0 89 23
them 0 89 23
in 0 89 23
charge 0 89 23
of 0 89 23
Iran! 0 89 23

Giuliani 0 89 24
shares 0 89 24
with 0 89 24
numerous 0 89 24
other 0 89 24
neocons 0 89 24
like 0 89 24
John 0 89 24
Bolton 0 89 24
a 0 89 24
strong 0 89 24
relationship 0 89 24
with 0 89 24
this 0 89 24
group. 0 89 24

In 0 89 25
fact, 0 89 25
both 0 89 25
Giuliani 0 89 25
and 0 89 25
Bolton 0 89 25
have 0 89 25
been 0 89 25
on 0 89 25
the 0 89 25
payroll 0 89 25
of 0 89 25
the 0 89 25
MeK 0 89 25
and 0 89 25
have 0 89 25
received 0 89 25
tens 0 89 25
of 0 89 25
thousands 0 89 25
of 0 89 25
dollars 0 89 25
to 0 89 25
speak 0 89 25
to 0 89 25
their 0 89 25
followers. 0 89 25

This 0 89 26
is 0 89 26
another 0 89 26
example 0 89 26
of 0 89 26
how 0 89 26
foreign 0 89 26
lobbies 0 89 26
and 0 89 26
special 0 89 26
interest 0 89 26
groups 0 89 26
maintain 0 89 26
an 0 89 26
iron 0 89 26
grip 0 89 26
on 0 89 26
our 0 89 26
foreign 0 89 26
policy. 0 89 26

Does 1 89 27
anyone 1 89 27
really 1 89 27
think 1 89 27
Iran 1 89 27
will 1 89 27
be 1 89 27
better 1 89 27
off 1 89 27
if 1 89 27
Trump 1 89 27
puts 1 89 27
a 1 89 27
bunch 1 89 27
of 1 89 27
“former” 1 89 27
terrorists 1 89 27
in 1 89 27
charge 1 89 27
of 1 89 27
the 1 89 27
country? 1 89 27

How 1 89 28
did 1 89 28
that 1 89 28
work 1 89 28
in 1 89 28
Libya? 1 89 28

It’s 0 89 29
easy 0 89 29
to 0 89 29
dismiss 0 89 29
the 0 89 29
bombastic 0 89 29
Giuliani 0 89 29
as 0 89 29
he 0 89 29
speaks 0 89 29
to 0 89 29
his 0 89 29
financial 0 89 29
benefactors 0 89 29
in 0 89 29
the 0 89 29
MeK. 0 89 29

Unfortunately, 0 89 30
however, 0 89 30
Giuliani’s 0 89 30
claims 0 89 30
were 0 89 30
confirmed 0 89 30
late 0 89 30
last 0 89 30
week, 0 89 30
when 0 89 30
the 0 89 30
Washington 0 89 30
Free 0 89 30
Beacon 0 89 30
published 0 89 30
a 0 89 30
three-page 0 89 30
policy 0 89 30
paper 0 89 30
being 0 89 30
circulated 0 89 30
among 0 89 30
National 0 89 30
Security 0 89 30
Council 0 89 30
officials 0 89 30
containing 0 89 30
plans 0 89 30
to 0 89 30
spark 0 89 30
regime 0 89 30
change 0 89 30
in 0 89 30
Iran. 0 89 30

The 0 89 31
paper 0 89 31
suggests 0 89 31
that 0 89 31
the 0 89 31
US 0 89 31
focus 0 89 31
on 0 89 31
Iran’s 0 89 31
many 0 89 31
ethnic 0 89 31
minority 0 89 31
groups 0 89 31
to 0 89 31
spark 0 89 31
unrest 0 89 31
and 0 89 31
an 0 89 31
eventual 0 89 31
overthrow 0 89 31
of 0 89 31
the 0 89 31
government. 0 89 31

This 0 89 32
is 0 89 32
virtually 0 89 32
the 0 89 32
same 0 89 32
road 0 89 32
map 0 89 32
that 0 89 32
the 0 89 32
US 0 89 32
has 0 89 32
followed 0 89 32
in 0 89 32
Iraq, 0 89 32
Libya, 0 89 32
Syria, 0 89 32
and 0 89 32
so 0 89 32
on. 0 89 32

The 0 89 33
results 0 89 33
have 0 89 33
been 0 89 33
unmitigated 0 89 33
disaster 1 89 33
after 1 89 33
disaster. 1 89 33

Unleashing 0 89 34
terrorists 0 89 34
on 0 89 34
Iran 0 89 34
to 0 89 34
overthrow 0 89 34
its 0 89 34
government 0 89 34
is 0 89 34
not 0 89 34
only 0 89 34
illegal 0 89 34
and 0 89 34
immoral: 0 89 34
it’s 0 89 34
also 0 89 34
incredibly 1 89 34
stupid. 1 89 34

We 0 89 35
know 0 89 35
from 0 89 35
9/11 0 89 35
that 0 89 35
blowback 0 89 35
is 0 89 35
real, 0 89 35
even 0 89 35
if 0 89 35
Giuliani 0 89 35
and 0 89 35
the 0 89 35
neocons 0 89 35
refuse 0 89 35
to 0 89 35
understand 0 89 35
it. 0 89 35

Iran 0 89 36
does 0 89 36
not 0 89 36
threaten 0 89 36
the 0 89 36
United 0 89 36
States. 0 89 36

Unlike 0 89 37
Washington’s 0 89 37
Arab 0 89 37
allies 0 89 37
in 0 89 37
the 0 89 37
region, 0 89 37
Iran 0 89 37
actually 0 89 37
holds 0 89 37
reasonably 0 89 37
democratic 0 89 37
elections 0 89 37
and 0 89 37
has 0 89 37
a 0 89 37
Western-oriented, 0 89 37
educated, 0 89 37
and 0 89 37
very 0 89 37
young 0 89 37
population. 0 89 37

Why 0 89 38
not 0 89 38
open 0 89 38
up 0 89 38
to 0 89 38
Iran 0 89 38
with 0 89 38
massive 0 89 38
amounts 0 89 38
of 0 89 38
trade 0 89 38
and 0 89 38
other 0 89 38
contacts? 0 89 38

Does 0 89 39
anyone 0 89 39
(except 0 89 39
for 0 89 39
the 0 89 39
neocons) 0 89 39
really 0 89 39
believe 0 89 39
it 0 89 39
is 0 89 39
better 0 89 39
to 0 89 39
unleash 0 89 39
terrorists 0 89 39
on 0 89 39
a 0 89 39
population 0 89 39
than 0 89 39
to 0 89 39
engage 0 89 39
them 0 89 39
in 0 89 39
trade 0 89 39
and 0 89 39
travel? 0 89 39

We 1 89 40
need 1 89 40
to 1 89 40
worry 1 89 40
about 1 89 40
blowback 1 89 40
from 1 89 40
President 1 89 40
Trump’s 1 89 40
fully-neoconized 1 89 40
Middle 1 89 40
East 1 89 40
policy! 1 89 40

That’s 1 89 41
the 1 89 41

be 0 90 5
for 0 90 5
regime 0 90 5
change, 0 90 5
so 0 90 5
I 0 90 5
think 0 90 5
Pompeo 1 90 5
really 1 90 5
isn't 1 90 5
a 1 90 5
good 1 90 5
fit 1 90 5
to 1 90 5
be 1 90 5
a 1 90 5
diplomat." 1 90 5

He's 0 90 6
right, 0 90 6
too. 0 90 6

Pompeo 0 90 7
has 0 90 7
advocated 0 90 7
for 0 90 7
regime 0 90 7
change 0 90 7
in 0 90 7
North 0 90 7
Korea. 0 90 7

We've 0 90 8
seen 0 90 8
exactly 0 90 8
what 0 90 8
happens 0 90 8
when 0 90 8
the 0 90 8
US 0 90 8
gets 0 90 8
involved 0 90 8
in 0 90 8
such 0 90 8
types 0 90 8
of 0 90 8
regime 0 90 8
changes, 0 90 8
and 0 90 8
the 0 90 8
truth 0 90 8
is 0 90 8
that 0 90 8
they 0 90 8
really 0 90 8
don't 0 90 8
work 0 90 8
out 0 90 8
too 0 90 8
well. 0 90 8

As 0 90 9
for 0 90 9
Haspel, 0 90 9
Paul 0 90 9
told 0 90 9
"Face 0 90 9
The 0 90 9
Nation," 0 90 9
"She 0 90 9
oversaw 0 90 9
an 0 90 9
illegal 0 90 9
black 0 90 9
ops 0 90 9
operation 0 90 9
in 0 90 9
Thailand 0 90 9
that 0 90 9
included 0 90 9
torture. 0 90 9

I 1 90 10
don't 1 90 10
think 1 90 10
torture 1 90 10
is 1 90 10
what 1 90 10
America 1 90 10
is 1 90 10
about." 1 90 10

On 0 90 11
"State 0 90 11
of 0 90 11
the 0 90 11
Union," 0 90 11
Paul 0 90 11
added, 0 90 11
"I'll 0 90 11
do 0 90 11
whatever 0 90 11
it 0 90 11
takes, 0 90 11
and 0 90 11
that 0 90 11
includes 0 90 11
filibuster" 0 90 11
to 0 90 11
block 0 90 11
their 0 90 11
confirmation. 0 90 11

"I 0 90 12
don't 0 90 12
have 0 90 12
the 0 90 12
power 0 90 12
to 0 90 12
stop 0 90 12
her 0 90 12
nomination," 0 90 12
he 0 90 12
said 0 90 12
of 0 90 12
Haspel. 0 90 12

"There's 0 90 13
enough 0 90 13
votes 0 90 13
she'll 0 90 13
eventually 0 90 13
win. 0 90 13

Few 1 90 14
things 1 90 14
in 1 90 14
life 1 90 14
. 1 90 14

. 1 90 15

. 1 90 16

[are] 1 90 17
worth 1 90 17
standing 1 90 17
up 1 90 17
saying 0 90 17
'enough 1 90 17
is 1 90 17
enough.'" 1 90 17

"We 1 90 18
are 1 90 18
not 1 90 18
a 1 90 18
people 1 90 18
that 1 90 18
should 1 90 18
be 1 90 18
so 1 90 18
fearful 1 90 18
or 1 90 18
vengeful 1 90 18
that 1 90 18
we 1 90 18
think 1 90 18
that 1 90 18
torture 1 90 18
is 1 90 18
somehow 1 90 18
acceptable," 1 90 18
he 0 90 18
added. 0 90 18

"On 0 90 19
what 0 90 19
level 0 90 19
could 0 90 19
torture 0 90 19
ever 0 90 19
be 0 90 19
acceptable? 0 90 19

We 1 90 20
should 1 90 20
make 1 90 20
a 1 90 20
stand 1 90 20
on 1 90 20
this. 1 90 20

She 1 90 21
should 1 90 21
never 1 90 21
lead 1 90 21
the 1 90 21
CIA." 1 90 21

Both 0 90 22
nominations 0 90 22
may 0 90 22
face 0 90 22
tough 0 90 22
confirmation 0 90 22
hearings, 0 90 22
but 0 90 22
it 0 90 22
seems 0 90 22
that 0 90 22
many 1 90 22
Americans 1 90 22
are 1 90 22
just 1 90 22
fine 1 90 22
with 1 90 22
these 1 90 22
types 1 90 22
of 1 90 22
people 1 90 22
being 1 90 22
in 1 90 22
these 1 90 22
types 1 90 22
of 1 90 22
offices. 1 90 22

The 0 90 23
only 0 90 23
thing 0 90 23
I 0 90 23
can 0 90 23
think 0 90 23
for 0 90 23
that 0 90 23
kind 0 90 23
of 0 90 23
reasoning 0 90 23
is 0 90 23
that 0 90 23
people 1 90 23
do 1 90 23
not 1 90 23
know 1 90 23
their 1 90 23
Constitution 1 90 23
and 1 90 23
understand 1 90 23
exactly 1 90 23
what 1 90 23
Senator 1 90 23
Paul 1 90 23
is 1 90 23
trying 1 90 23
to 1 90 23
warn 1 90 23
America 1 90 23
about. 1 90 23

Instead, 0 90 24
people 0 90 24
are 0 90 24
acting 0 90 24
out 0 90 24
of 0 90 24
emotion 0 90 24
and 0 90 24
fear. 0 90 24

Do 0 90 25
I 0 90 25
believe 0 90 25
we 0 90 25
should 0 90 25
be 0 90 25
concerned 0 90 25
about 0 90 25
North 0 90 25
Korea? 0 90 25

Sure, 0 90 26
but 0 90 26
I'm 0 90 26
hardly 0 90 26
worried 0 90 26
that 0 90 26
they 0 90 26
will 0 90 26
actually 0 90 26
attack 0 90 26
us. 0 90 26

Am 0 90 27
I 0 90 27
concerned 0 90 27
about 0 90 27
jihadis? 0 90 27

Yep, 0 90 28
but 0 90 28
I'm 0 90 28
not 0 90 28
sure 0 90 28
I've 0 90 28
seen 0 90 28
any 0 90 28
real 0 90 28
hard 0 90 28
evidence 0 90 28
that 0 90 28
torturing 0 90 28
them 0 90 28
has 0 90 28
produced 0 90 28
any 0 90 28
information 0 90 28
that 0 90 28
has 0 90 28
led 0 90 28
to 0 90 28
stopping 0 90 28
terror 0 90 28
attacks. 0 90 28

And 0 90 29
before 0 90 29
you 0 90 29
tell 0 90 29
me 0 90 29
about 0 90 29
the 0 90 29
media 0 90 29
reports 0 90 29
and 0 90 29
CIA 0 90 29
involvement, 0 90 29
just 0 90 29
keep 0 90 29
in 0 90 29
mind 0 90 29
that 0 90 29
a 1 90 29
former 1 90 29
journalist, 1 90 29
who 1 90 29
is 1 90 29
now 1 90 29
dead, 1 90 29
told 1 90 29
the 1 90 29
world 1 90 29
that 1 90 29
the 1 90 29
media 1 90 29
lies 1 90 29
for 1 90 29
the 1 90 29
CIA. 1 90 29

So, 1 90 30
I'm 1 90 30
wary 1 90 30
of 1 90 30
media 1 90 30
reports 1 90 30
that 1 90 30
claim 1 90 30
there 1 90 30
have 1 90 30
been 1 90 30
results 1 90 30
from 1 90 30
the 1 90 30
tactics 1 90 30
used. 1 90 30

Trump 1 90 31
has 1 90 31
obviously 1 90 31
had 1 90 31
praise 1 90 31
for 1 90 31
both 1 90 31
Pompeo 1 90 31
and 1 90 31
Haspel, 1 90 31
but 1 90 31
then 1 90 31
again, 1 90 31
his 1 90 31
administration 1 90 31
has 1 90 31
quite 1 90 31
a 1 90 31
bit 1 90 31
of 1 90 31
turn 1 90 31
over 1 90 31
too. 1 90 31

Mike 0 90 32
Pompeo, 0 90 32
Director 0 90 32
of 0 90 32
the 0 90 32
CIA, 0 90 32
will 0 90 32
become 0 90 32
our 0 90 32
new 0 90 32
Secretary 0 90 32
of 0 90 32
State. 0 90 32

He 1 90 33
will 1 90 33
do 1 90 33
a 1 90 33
fantastic 1 90 33
job! 1 90 33

Thank 0 90 34
you 0 90 34
to 0 90 34
Rex 0 90 34
Tillerson 0 90 34
for 0 90 34
his 0 90 34
service! 0 90 34

Gina 0 90 35
Haspel 0 90 35
will 0 90 35
become 0 90 35
the 0 90 35
new 0 90 35
Director 0 90 35
of 0 90 35
the 0 90 35

and 0 90 35
the 0 90 35
first 0 90 35

chosen. 0 90 35

in 0 91 14
Madagascar 0 91 14
has 0 91 14
been 0 91 14
released. 0 91 14

Officials 0 91 15
warn 0 91 15
that 0 91 15
it’s 0 91 15
inevitable 0 91 15
that 0 91 15
this 0 91 15
bacterial 0 91 15
infection 0 91 15
that’s 0 91 15
infected 0 91 15
over 0 91 15
2000 0 91 15
people 1 91 15
will 1 91 15
become 1 91 15
resistant 1 91 15
to 1 91 15
antibiotics. 1 91 15

The 0 91 16
only 0 91 16
way 0 91 16
to 0 91 16
treat 0 91 16
a 0 91 16
person 0 91 16
who 0 91 16
has 0 91 16
contracted 0 91 16
the 0 91 16
plague 0 91 16
is 0 91 16
with 0 91 16
antibiotics. 0 91 16

But 0 91 17
experts 0 91 17
now 0 91 17
warn 0 91 17
that 0 91 17
because 0 91 17
they 0 91 17
are 0 91 17
being 0 91 17
used 0 91 17
so 0 91 17
much 0 91 17
to 0 91 17
treat 0 91 17
the 0 91 17
infection, 0 91 17
antibiotics 1 91 17
resistance 1 91 17
is 1 91 17
inevitable 1 91 17
and 0 91 17
making 0 91 17
this 0 91 17
disease 0 91 17
much 0 91 17
more 0 91 17
terrifying. 0 91 17

Once 1 91 18
the 1 91 18
bacteria 1 91 18
is 1 91 18
resistant, 1 91 18
the 0 91 18
Madagascar 0 91 18
healthcare 0 91 18
system 0 91 18
will 0 91 18
be 0 91 18
overwhelmed, 0 91 18
and 0 91 18
the 0 91 18
disease 0 91 18
will 0 91 18
have 0 91 18
control 0 91 18
of 0 91 18
the 0 91 18
nation. 0 91 18

As 0 91 19
Slavo 0 91 19
noted, 0 91 19
should 0 91 19
the 0 91 19
disease 0 91 19
spread 0 91 19
to 0 91 19
the 0 91 19
African 0 91 19
mainland, 0 91 19
one 0 91 19
can 0 91 19
assume 0 91 19
that 0 91 19
it 0 91 19
will 0 91 19
be 0 91 19
all 0 91 19
but 0 91 19
impossible 0 91 19
to 0 91 19
control, 0 91 19
thus 0 91 19
increasing 1 91 19

Donald 0 93 10

totally 1 93 10
correct 1 93 10
that 0 93 10

fully 0 93 21

outside 0 93 24

of 0 93 25
the 0 93 25

misrepresented 0 93 25
by 0 93 25
the 0 93 25
Trump-hating 0 93 25
presstitutes 0 93 25
as 0 93 25
vindication 0 93 25
of 0 93 25

“A 0 93 25

will 0 93 25
force 0 93 25

from 0 93 25
office. 0 93 25

Manafort 0 93 26
was 0 93 26
found 0 93 26
guilty 0 93 26
not 0 93 26
of 0 93 26
Russiagate, 0 93 26
but 0 93 26
of 0 93 26
income 0 93 26

We 0 93 27
do 0 93 27
not 0 93 27
know 0 93 27
if 0 93 27
Manafort 0 93 27
is 0 93 27
guilty 0 93 27
or 0 93 27
is 0 93 27
simply 0 93 27
a 0 93 27
victim 0 93 27
of 0 93 27
Mueller’s 0 93 27
frameup 0 93 27
and 0 93 27
an 1 93 27
incompetent 1 93 27
jury. 1 93 27

American 0 93 28
juries 0 93 28
are 0 93 28
notoriously 0 93 28
incompetent, 0 93 28
which 0 93 28
is 0 93 28
why 0 93 28
97% 0 93 28
of 0 93 28
felony 0 93 28
indictments 0 93 28
are 0 93 28
settled 0 93 28
with 0 93 28
a 0 93 28
plea 0 93 28
bargain. 0 93 28

Even 0 93 29
the 0 93 29
innocent 0 93 29
had 0 93 29
rather 0 93 29
work 0 93 29
out 0 93 29
a 0 93 29
plea 0 93 29
arrangement 0 93 29
and 0 93 29
admit 0 93 29
to 0 93 29
something 0 93 29
that 0 93 29
they 0 93 29
did 0 93 29
not 0 93 29
do 0 93 29
than 0 93 29
to 0 93 29
face 0 93 29
an 1 93 29
insouciant 1 93 29
American 1 93 29
jury. 1 93 29

Remember 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
jury 0 93 30
that 0 93 30
condemned 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
survivors 0 93 30
of 0 93 30
the 0 93 30

locked 0 93 30
away 0 93 30
for 0 93 30
many 0 93 30
years 0 93 30
so 0 93 30
that 0 93 30
they 0 93 30
could 0 93 30
not 0 93 30
talk 0 93 30
and 0 93 30
tell 0 93 30
of 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
mass 0 93 30
murder 0 93 30
inflicted 0 93 30
on 0 93 30
a 0 93 30
religious 0 93 30
group 0 93 30
by 0 93 30
the 0 93 30
FBI. 0 93 30

It 0 93 31
is 0 93 31
unclear 0 93 31
how 0 93 31
much 0 93 31
of 0 93 31
a 0 93 31
crime 0 93 31
it 0 93 31
can 0 93 31
be 0 93 31
to 0 93 31
misrepresent 0 93 31
your 0 93 31
financial 0 93 31
position 0 93 31
on 0 93 31
a 0 93 31

when 0 93 31
one 0 93 31
of 0 93 31
the 0 93 31
causes 0 93 31
of 0 93 31
the 0 93 31
mortgage-backed 0 93 31
derivative 0 93 31
crisis 0 93 31
was 0 93 31
the 0 93 31
misrepresentation 0 93 31
of 0 93 31

Instead 0 93 32
of 0 93 32
prosecution, 0 93 32
Washington 0 93 32
relied 0 93 32
on 0 93 32

statements 0 93 41
disputing 0 93 41
the 0 93 41
orchestrated 0 93 41
Russiagate 0 93 41
accusations 0 93 41
that, 0 93 41
if 0 93 41
Manafort 0 93 41
as 0 93 41
witness 0 93 41
for 0 93 41
the 0 93 41
Special 0 93 41
Prosecutor 0 93 41
contradicted, 0 93 41
could 0 93 41
send 0 93 41
the 0 93 41
President 0 93 41
of 0 93 41
the 0 93 41
United 0 93 41
States 0 93 41
to 0 93 41
prison 0 93 41
for 0 93 41
perjury. 0 93 41

Knowing 0 93 42
this, 0 93 42
Mueller, 0 93 42
in 0 93 42
my 0 93 42
opinion 0 93 42
a 0 93 42
proven 0 93 42
corrupt 0 93 42
person, 0 93 42
decided 0 93 42
to 1 93 42
put 1 93 42
the 1 93 42
squeeze 1 93 42
on 0 93 42
Manafort 0 93 42
in 0 93 42
order 0 93 42
to 0 93 42
force 0 93 42
Manafort 0 93 42
to 0 93 42
save 0 93 42
himself 0 93 42
by 0 93 42
giving 0 93 42
false 0 93 42
testimony 0 93 42
against 0 93 42
Trump. 0 93 42

This 0 93 43
tactic 0 93 43
is 0 93 43
used 0 93 43
every 0 93 43
day 0 93 43
by 0 93 43
state, 0 93 43
local, 0 93 43
and 0 93 43
federal 0 93 43
prosecutors. 0 93 43

Americans 0 93 44
who 0 93 44
believe 0 93 44
the 0 93 44
indictments 0 93 44
and 0 93 44
convictions 0 93 44
are 0 93 44
unaware 0 93 44
that 0 93 44
97% 0 93 44
of 0 93 44
the 0 93 44
time 0 93 44
the 0 93 44
convictions 0 93 44
rest 0 93 44
on 0 93 44
self-incrimination 0 93 44
in 0 93 44
order 0 93 44
to 0 93 44
avoid 0 93 44
worse 0 93 44
punishment. 0 93 44

In 0 93 45
Manafort’s 0 93 45
case 0 93 45
it 0 93 45
didn’t, 0 93 45
or 0 93 45
hasn’t, 0 93 45
worked. 0 93 45

Yet. 0 93 46

Manafort 0 93 47
is 0 93 47
due 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
a 0 93 47
second 0 93 47
trial, 0 93 47
this 0 93 47
time 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
allegely 0 93 47
acting 0 93 47
as 0 93 47
an 0 93 47
unregistered 0 93 47
foreign 0 93 47
agent 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
Ukrainian 0 93 47
interests 0 93 47
and 0 93 47
for 0 93 47
making 0 93 47
false 0 93 47
statements 0 93 47
not 0 93 47
under 0 93 47
oath 0 93 47
to 0 93 47
the 0 93 47
US 0 93 47
government. 0 93 47

Reportedly, 0 93 48
Manafort 0 93 48
is 0 93 48
being 0 93 48
held 0 93 48
in 0 93 48
solitary 0 93 48
confinement, 0 93 48
a 0 93 48
form 0 93 48
of 0 93 48
torture 0 93 48
designed 0 93 48
to 0 93 48
break 0 93 48
a 0 93 48
person’s 0 93 48
spirit. 0 93 48

Like 0 93 49
Manafort’s 0 93 49
first 0 93 49
trial, 0 93 49
his 0 93 49
second 0 93 49
trial 0 93 49
has 0 93 49
nothing 0 93 49
whatsoever 0 93 49
to 0 93 49
do 0 93 49
with 0 93 49
Russiagate, 0 93 49
but 0 93 49
you 0 93 49
will 0 93 49
never 0 93 49
learn 0 93 49
that 0 93 49
from 0 93 49
the 0 93 49
presstitute 0 93 49
media 0 93 49
or 0 93 49
from 0 93 49
the 0 93 49
Democratic 0 93 49
Party. 0 93 49

Manafort 0 93 50
can 0 93 50
still 0 93 50
be 0 93 50
coerced 0 93 50
to 0 93 50
say 0 93 50
something 0 93 50
that 0 93 50
can 0 93 50
be 0 93 50
used 0 93 50
to 0 93 50
drive 0 93 50
Trump 0 93 50
from 0 93 50
office. 0 93 50

What 0 93 51
about 0 93 51
Michael 0 93 51
Cohen, 0 93 51
a 0 93 51
former 0 93 51
attorney 0 93 51
for 0 93 51
Trump? 0 93 51

Mueller 0 93 52
saw 0 93 52
no 0 93 52
value 0 93 52
in 0 93 52
the 0 93 52
Cohen 0 93 52
case 0 93 52
and 0 93 52
passed 0 93 52
it 0 93 52
off 0 93 52
to 0 93 52
a 0 93 52
regular 0 93 52
US 0 93 52
attorney 0 93 52
to 0 93 52
prosecute. 0 93 52

Therefore, 0 93 53
it 0 93 53
would 0 93 53
appear 0 93 53
not 0 93 53
to 0 93 53
be 0 93 53
part 0 93 53
of 0 93 53
the 0 93 53
Russiagate 0 93 53
investigation. 0 93 53

Cohen 0 93 54
avoided 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
jury 0 93 54
and 0 93 54
said 0 93 54
he 0 93 54
was 0 93 54
guilty 0 93 54
of 0 93 54
five 0 93 54
counts 0 93 54
of 0 93 54
personal 0 93 54
income 0 93 54
tax 0 93 54
evasion, 0 93 54
one 0 93 54
count 0 93 54
of 0 93 54
making 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
false 0 93 54
statement 0 93 54
to 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
financial 0 93 54
institution 0 93 54
in 0 93 54
order 0 93 54
to 0 93 54
get 0 93 54
a 0 93 54
loan, 0 93 54
and 0 93 54
two 0 93 54
counts 0 93 54
related 0 93 54
to 0 93 54
illegal 0 93 54
campaign 0 93 54
contributions. 0 93 54

With 0 93 55
regard 0 93 55
to 0 93 55
the 0 93 55
campagin 0 93 55
contributions, 0 93 55
he 0 93 55
contradicted 0 93 55
his 0 93 55
previous 0 93 55
statements. 0 93 55

He 0 93 56
said 0 93 56
that 0 93 56
on 0 93 56
Trump’s 0 93 56
instruction, 0 93 56
he 0 93 56
paid 0 93 56
off 0 93 56
two 0 93 56
women 0 93 56
who 0 93 56
were 0 93 56
claiming 0 93 56
sexual 0 93 56
affairs 0 93 56
with 0 93 56
Trump. 0 93 56

The 1 93 57
intricacies 1 93 57
of 1 93 57
American 1 93 57
laws 1 93 57
relating 1 93 57
to 1 93 57
politics 1 93 57
are 1 93 57
often 1 93 57
unclear. 1 93 57

Apparently, 0 93 58
the 0 93 58
charge 0 93 58
is 0 93 58
that 0 93 58
Cohen 0 93 58
used 0 93 58
monies 0 93 58
raised 0 93 58
for 0 93 58
a 0 93 58
political 0 93 58
campaign 0 93 58
to 0 93 58
pay 0 93 58
off 0 93 58
two 0 93 58
women, 0 93 58
who 0 93 58
saw 0 93 58
and 0 93 58
capitalized 0 93 58
on 0 93 58
an 0 93 58
opportunity 0 93 58
to 0 93 58
extort 0 93 58
Trump 0 93 58
for 0 93 58
money, 0 93 58
and 0 93 58
this 0 93 58
was 0 93 58
an 0 93 58
illegal 0 93 58
use 0 93 58
of 0 93 58
the 0 93 58
money. 0 93 58

Why 1 93 59
a 1 93 59
lawyer 1 93 59
would 1 93 59
pay 1 93 59
off 1 93 59
women, 1 93 59
whose 1 93 59
stories 1 93 59
might 1 93 59
or 1 93 59
might 1 93 59
not 1 93 59
be 1 93 59
true, 1 93 59
in 1 93 59
an 1 93 59
illegal 1 93 59
way 1 93 59
when 1 93 59
his 1 93 59
client 1 93 59
is 1 93 59
a 1 93 59
multi-billionaire 1 93 59
doesn’t 1 93 59
make 1 93 59
much 1 93 59
sense. 1 93 59

But 1 93 60
these 1 93 60
are 1 93 60
not 1 93 60
the 1 93 60
kind 1 93 60
of 1 93 60
questions 1 93 60
that 1 93 60
the 1 93 60
presstitutes 1 93 60
are 1 93 60
interested 1 93 60
in. 1 93 60

Nevertheless, 0 93 61
Cohen’s 0 93 61
plea 0 93 61
is 0 93 61
associated 0 93 61
with 0 93 61
a 0 93 61
case 0 93 61
brought 0 93 61
by 0 93 61
another 0 93 61
prosecutor, 0 93 61
not 0 93 61
by 0 93 61
Special 0 93 61
Prosecutor 0 93 61
Mueller. 0 93 61

I 0 93 62
am 0 93 62
not 0 93 62
sufficiently 0 93 62
familiar 0 93 62
with 0 93 62
US 0 93 62
legal 0 93 62
procedures 0 93 62
to 0 93 62
be 0 93 62
able 0 93 62
to 0 93 62
say 0 93 62
how 0 93 62
this 0 93 62
gets 0 93 62
brought 0 93 62
back 0 93 62
into 0 93 62
Mueller’s 0 93 62
investigation. 0 93 62

The 0 93 63
facts 0 93 63
are 0 93 63
this: 0 93 63

The 0 93 64
US 0 93 64
military/security 0 93 64
complex 0 93 64
will 0 93 64
not 0 93 64
permit 0 93 64
any 0 93 64
normalization 0 93 64
of 0 93 64
relations 0 93 64
with 0 93 64
Russia. 0 93 64

Period. 0 93 65

At 0 93 66
some 0 93 66
point 0 93 66
Putin 0 93 66
and 0 93 66
Lavrov 0 93 66
and 0 93 66
the 0 93 66
idiot 0 93 66
Russian 0 93 66
Atlanticist 0 93 66
Integrationists 0 93 66
will 0 93 66
have 0 93 66
to 0 93 66
acknowledge 0 93 66
this 0 93 66
fact, 0 93 66
or 0 93 66
Russia 0 93 66
will 0 93 66
be 0 93 66
destroyed. 0 93 66

Trump, 0 93 67
by 0 93 67
declaring 0 93 67
normalization 0 93 67
of 0 93 67
relations 0 93 67
as 0 93 67

principal 0 93 67

for 0 93 67
his 0 93 67

of 0 93 67
the 0 93 67

By 0 93 68

Trump 0 93 69
will 0 93 69
never 0 93 69
be 0 93 69
forgiven 0 93 69
for 0 93 69

person 0 93 75
so 0 93 75
unclued 0 93 75
survive? 0 93 75

As 0 93 76
I 0 93 76
wrote 0 93 76
during 0 93 76
the 0 93 76
presidential 0 93 76
campaign, 0 93 76
Trump 0 93 76
has 0 93 76
no 0 93 76
idea 0 93 76
of 0 93 76
Washington 0 93 76
and 0 93 76
no 0 93 76
idea 0 93 76
who 0 93 76
to 0 93 76
appoint 0 93 76
who 0 93 76
would 0 93 76
support 0 93 76
him 0 93 76
rather 0 93 76
than 0 93 76
work 0 93 76
against 0 93 76
him. 0 93 76

Consequently, 0 93 77
he 0 93 77
has 0 93 77
a 0 93 77
government 0 93 77
working 0 93 77
against 0 93 77
him. 0 93 77

Senators 0 93 78
John 0 93 78
McCain 0 93 78
and 0 93 78
Lindsey 0 93 78
Graham 0 93 78
are 0 93 78
working 0 93 78
to 0 93 78
prevent 0 93 78
the 0 93 78
Republican 0 93 78
Party 0 93 78
from 0 93 78
supporting 0 93 78
the 0 93 78
party’s 0 93 78
president. 0 93 78

They 0 93 79
could 0 93 79
easily 0 93 79
succeed. 0 93 79

The 1 93 80
entirety 1 93 80
of 1 93 80
the 1 93 80
House 1 93 80
and 1 93 80
Senate 1 93 80
of 1 93 80
both 1 93 80
parties 1 93 80
is 1 93 80
in 1 93 80
thrall 1 93 80
to 1 93 80
the 1 93 80
campaign 1 93 80

of 1 93 80
the 1 93 80
military/security 1 93 80
complex. 1 93 80

What 0 93 81
can 0 93 81
President 0 93 81
Trump 0 93 81
do? 0 93 81

He 0 93 82
could 0 93 82
fight, 0 93 82
not 0 93 82
with 0 93 82
words 0 93 82
on 0 93 82
Twitter, 0 93 82
but 0 93 82
with 0 93 82
the 0 93 82
powers 0 93 82
of 0 93 82
the 0 93 82
presidency. 0 93 82

There 0 93 83
is 0 93 83
far 0 93 83
more 0 93 83
evidence 0 93 83

there 0 93 83
is 0 93 83
evidence 0 93 83
that 0 93 83
it 0 93 83
is 0 93 83

He 0 93 96
is 0 93 96

Militarily, 0 93 100
Israel 0 93 100
is 0 93 100
of 0 93 100
no 0 93 100
consequence. 0 93 100

Twice 0 93 101
the 0 93 101

Army, 0 93 101

Israel 0 93 102
is 0 93 102

to 0 93 102
try 0 93 102
it 0 93 102
a 0 93 102
third 0 93 102
time, 0 93 102
and 0 93 102
is 0 93 102

what 0 93 103
does 0 93 103
the 0 93 103
world 0 93 103
see? 0 93 103

Two 0 93 104
countries, 0 93 104
both 0 93 104
the 0 93 104
result 0 93 104
of 0 93 104
exterminating 0 93 104
the 0 93 104
native 0 93 104
populations, 0 93 104
distrusted 0 93 104
and 0 93 104
universally 0 93 104
hated, 0 93 104
both 0 93 104
of 0 93 104
which 0 93 104
survive 0 93 104
by 0 93 104
purhasing 0 93 104
the 0 93 104
governments 0 93 104
of 0 93 104
other 0 93 104
countries 0 93 104
and 0 93 104
by 0 93 104
endless 0 93 104
lies 0 93 104
that 0 93 104
describe 0 93 104
everyone 0 93 104
but 0 93 104
themselves 0 93 104
and 0 93 104
their 0 93 104
vassals 0 93 104
as 0 93 104
evil 0 93 104
criminals 0 93 104
that 0 93 104

For 0 93 105

the 0 93 105
Gaza 0 93 105

the 0 93 105

ever 0 93 105

the 0 93 105
world, 0 93 105

being 0 93 105
systematically 0 93 105

all 0 93 105
life 0 93 105
within 0 93 105
it 0 93 105
by 0 93 105
Israel 0 93 105
under 1 93 105
cover 1 93 105
of 1 93 105
the 1 93 105
obvious 1 93 105
and 1 93 105
transparanent 1 93 105
lie 1 93 105
that 0 93 105
all 0 93 105
within 0 93 105
Gaza 0 93 105
are 0 93 105
terrorists 0 93 105
outfitted 0 93 105
with 0 93 105
bomb 0 93 105
belts 0 93 105
who 0 93 105
are 0 93 105
committed 0 93 105
to 0 93 105
the 0 93 105
destruction 0 93 105
of 0 93 105
Israel. 0 93 105

Not 0 93 106
only 0 93 106
men 0 93 106
of 0 93 106

United 0 93 107
States 0 93 107
Secretary 0 93 107
of 0 93 107
State 0 93 107
agrees 0 93 107
with 0 93 107
Israel 0 93 107
that 0 93 107
all 0 93 107
Palestinians 0 93 107
must 0 93 107
be 0 93 107
destroyed, 0 93 107

The 0 93 108
Chinese 0 93 108

the 0 93 108
financial 0 93 108
opportunities 0 93 108
that 0 93 108
the 1 93 108

otherwise 0 93 108
do 0 93 108
not 0 93 108

any 0 93 108

during 0 93 110
the 0 93 110

Slowly, 0 93 111
if 0 93 111
not 0 93 111
surely, 0 93 111
the 0 93 111

coming 0 93 111

If 1 93 112

what 1 93 112
happens 1 93 112
when 1 93 112

It 1 93 114

The 0 93 115

that 0 93 115

on 0 93 115
false 0 93 115

Such 1 93 118
an 1 93 118

would 1 93 118
be 1 93 118
a 1 93 118
coup. 1 93 118

The 1 93 119
consequence 1 93 119
would 1 93 119
be 1 93 119
deep 1 93 119
and 1 93 119
permanent 1 93 119
divisions 1 93 119

indeed 1 96 3
providential 1 96 3
development. 1 96 3

Regarding 0 96 4
Bergoglio, 0 96 4
Viganò 0 96 4
testifies 0 96 4
that 0 96 4
in 0 96 4
2013 0 96 4
he 0 96 4
personally 0 96 4
informed 0 96 4
him 0 96 4
about 0 96 4
McCarrick’s 0 96 4
history, 0 96 4
the 0 96 4
dossier 0 96 4
of 0 96 4
the 0 96 4
Congregation 0 96 4
for 0 96 4
Bishops 0 96 4
on 0 96 4
his 0 96 4
sexual 0 96 4
crimes 0 96 4
against 0 96 4
boys 0 96 4
and 0 96 4
young 0 96 4
men, 0 96 4
and 0 96 4
the 0 96 4
disciplinary 0 96 4
sanctions 0 96 4
imposed 0 96 4
upon 0 96 4
him 0 96 4
by 0 96 4
Benedict 0 96 4
XVI 0 96 4
(forbidding 0 96 4
residence 0 96 4
in 0 96 4
a 0 96 4
seminary, 0 96 4
public 0 96 4
appearances 0 96 4
and 0 96 4
Masses). 0 96 4

Evidently 0 96 5
already 0 96 5
aware 0 96 5
of 0 96 5
these 0 96 5
facts, 0 96 5
however, 0 96 5
Bergoglio 0 96 5
not 0 96 5
only 0 96 5
rehabilitated 0 96 5
McCarrick 0 96 5
but 0 96 5
made 0 96 5
him 0 96 5
a 0 96 5
“trusted 0 96 5
counselor” 0 96 5
who 0 96 5
advised 0 96 5
the 0 96 5
elevation 0 96 5
of 0 96 5

prominent 0 96 5
episcopal 0 96 5

they 0 96 5
now 0 96 5
discredit. 0 96 5

All 0 96 6
of 0 96 6
this 0 96 6
happened 0 96 6
before 0 96 6
Bergoglio, 0 96 6
bowing 0 96 6
to 0 96 6
worldwide 0 96 6
public 0 96 6
pressure, 0 96 6
finally—only 0 96 6
weeks 0 96 6
ago—took 0 96 6
decisive 0 96 6
action 0 96 6
against 0 96 6
his 0 96 6
“trusted 1 96 6
counselor.” 1 96 6
McCarrick 0 96 6
had 0 96 6
lobbied 0 96 6
for 0 96 6
Bergoglio’s 0 96 6
election, 0 96 6
along 0 96 6
with 0 96 6
Maradiaga 0 96 6
and 0 96 6
the 1 96 6
infamous 1 96 6
Cardinal 1 96 6
Danneels, 0 96 6
who 1 96 6
covered 1 96 6
up 1 96 6
homosexual 1 96 6
rape 1 96 6
committed 1 96 6
by 1 96 6
a 1 96 6
priest 1 96 6
against 1 96 6
his 1 96 6
own 1 96 6
nephew,has 1 96 6
supported 1 96 6
“same-sex 1 96 6
marriage,” 1 96 6
and 1 96 6
advised 1 96 6
the 1 96 6
King 1 96 6
of 1 96 6
Belgium 1 96 6
to 1 96 6
sign 1 96 6
a 1 96 6
law 1 96 6
legalizing 1 96 6
abortion 1 96 6
in 1 96 6
1990. 1 96 6

As 1 96 7
Edward 1 96 7
Pentin 1 96 7
notes: 1 96 7
“all 1 96 7
3 1 96 7
prelates 1 96 7
have 1 96 7
since 1 96 7
been 1 96 7
special 1 96 7
advisors 1 96 7
of 1 96 7
Francis 1 96 7
or 1 96 7
rehabilitated 1 96 7
by 1 96 7
him.” 1 96 7

Viganò 0 96 8
concludes 0 96 8
his 0 96 8
testimony 0 96 8
by 0 96 8
declaring 0 96 8
that 0 96 8
all 0 96 8
of 0 96 8
the 0 96 8
prelates 0 96 8
involved 0 96 8
(many 0 96 8
others 0 96 8
are 0 96 8
implicated), 0 96 8
including 0 96 8
Bergoglio, 0 96 8
should 0 96 8
resign 0 96 8
their 0 96 8
offices 0 96 8
for 0 96 8
the 0 96 8
good 0 96 8
of 0 96 8
the 0 96 8
Church. 0 96 8

As 0 96 9
to 0 96 9
Bergoglio 0 96 9
in 0 96 9
particular, 0 96 9
he 0 96 9
courageously 0 96 9
states 0 96 9
openly 0 96 9
the 0 96 9
truth 0 96 9
that 0 96 9
so 0 96 9
many 0 96 9
of 0 96 9
his 0 96 9
brethren 0 96 9
know 0 96 9
but 0 96 9
fear 0 96 9
to 0 96 9
speak 0 96 9
in 0 96 9
public: 0 96 9

I 0 96 10
want 0 96 10
to 0 96 10
recall 0 96 10
this 1 96 10
indefectible 1 96 10
truth 1 96 10
of 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
Church’s 0 96 10
holiness 0 96 10
to 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
many 0 96 10
people 0 96 10
who 0 96 10
have 0 96 10
been 0 96 10
so 0 96 10
deeply 1 96 10
scandalized 1 96 10
by 1 96 10
the 1 96 10
abominable 1 96 10
and 1 96 10
sacrilegious 1 96 10
behavior 1 96 10
of 0 96 10
the 0 96 10
former 0 96 10
Archbishop 0 96 10
of 0 96 10
Washington, 0 96 10
Theodore 0 96 10
McCarrick; 0 96 10
by 0 96 10
the 1 96 10
grave, 1 96 10
disconcerting 1 96 10
and 1 96 10

2018 0 96 11
Pope 0 96 11
Francis 0 96 11
said 0 96 11
these 0 96 11
words: 0 96 11
“Everyone 1 96 11
is 1 96 11
guilty 1 96 11
for 1 96 11
the 1 96 11
good 1 96 11
he 1 96 11
could 1 96 11
have 1 96 11
done 1 96 11
and 1 96 11
did 1 96 11
not 1 96 11
do 1 96 11
... 1 96 11

If 1 96 12
we 1 96 12
do 1 96 12
not 1 96 12
oppose 1 96 12
evil, 1 96 12
we 1 96 12
tacitly 1 96 12
feed 1 96 12
it. 1 96 12

We 0 96 13
need 0 96 13
to 0 96 13
intervene 0 96 13
where 0 96 13
evil 0 96 13
is 0 96 13
spreading; 0 96 13
for 0 96 13
evil 0 96 13
spreads 0 96 13
where 0 96 13
daring 0 96 13
Christians 0 96 13
who 0 96 13
oppose 0 96 13
evil 0 96 13
with 0 96 13
good 0 96 13
are 0 96 13
lacking.” 0 96 13
[emphasis 0 96 13

If 0 96 13
this 0 96 13
is 0 96 13
rightly 0 96 13
to 0 96 13
be 0 96 13
considered 0 96 13
a 0 96 13
serious 0 96 13
moral 0 96 13
responsibility 0 96 13
for 0 96 13
every 0 96 13
believer, 0 96 13
how 0 96 13
much 0 96 13
graver 0 96 13
is 0 96 13
it 0 96 13
for 0 96 13
the 1 96 13
Church’s 1 96 13
supreme 1 96 13
pastor, 1 96 13
who 1 96 13
in 1 96 13
the 1 96 13
case 1 96 13
of 1 96 13
McCarrick 1 96 13
not 1 96 13
only 1 96 13
did 1 96 13
not 1 96 13
oppose 1 96 13
evil 1 96 13
but 1 96 13
associated 1 96 13
himself 1 96 13
in 1 96 13
doing 1 96 13
evil 1 96 13
with 1 96 13
someone 1 96 13
he 1 96 13
knew 1 96 13
to 1 96 13
be 1 96 13
deeply 1 96 13
corrupt. 1 96 13

He 0 96 14
followed 0 96 14
the 0 96 14
advice 0 96 14
of 0 96 14
someone 1 96 14
he 1 96 14
knew 1 96 14
well 1 96 14
to 1 96 14
be 1 96 14
a 1 96 14
pervert, 1 96 14
thus 0 96 14
multiplying 0 96 14
exponentially 0 96 14
with 0 96 14
his 0 96 14
supreme 0 96 14
authority 0 96 14
the 0 96 14
evil 0 96 14
done 0 96 14
by 0 96 14
McCarrick. 0 96 14

And 0 96 15
how 0 96 15
many 0 96 15
other 0 96 15
evil 1 96 15
pastors 1 96 15
is 0 96 15

up 0 96 15
in 0 96 15
their 1 96 15
active 1 96 15
destruction 1 96 15
of 1 96 15
the 1 96 15
Church! 1 96 15

[my 0 96 16
emphasis] 0 96 16
Francis 0 96 16
is 0 96 16
abdicating 0 96 16
the 0 96 16
mandate 0 96 16
which 0 96 16
Christ 0 96 16
gave 0 96 16

Peter 0 96 16
to 0 96 16
confirm 0 96 16
the 0 96 16
brethren. 0 96 16

Indeed, 0 96 17
by 0 96 17
his 0 96 17
action 0 96 17
he 0 96 17
has 0 96 17
divided 0 96 17
them, 0 96 17
led 0 96 17
them 0 96 17
into 0 96 17
error, 0 96 17
and 0 96 17
encouraged 1 96 17
the 1 96 17

moment 1 96 18
for 0 96 18
the 0 96 18

zero 0 96 18

Even 0 96 23
before 0 96 23

however, 0 96 23
the 0 96 23

there 1 96 24
is 1 96 24
little 1 96 24

they 1 96 24
will 1 96 24
continue 1 96 24
the 1 96 24

that 1 96 24

nearly 1 96 24
sixty 1 96 24

“advancement 1 96 25
to 1 96 25

for 1 96 25
them 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
common 1 96 25
life 1 96 25
and 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
priestly 1 96 25
ministry 1 96 25
would 1 96 25
constitute 1 96 25
serious 1 96 25
dangers.” 1 96 25

refuse 1 96 25
to 1 96 25
state 1 96 25
the 1 96 25
simple 1 96 25
truth 1 96 25
that 1 96 25
homosexuality 1 96 25
is 1 96 25
a 1 96 25
perversion 1 96 25
that 1 96 25
precludes 1 96 25
ordination 1 96 25

does 1 96 25
any 1 96 25

full 0 96 52

from 0 96 52
Viganò 0 96 52
himself 0 96 52
that 0 96 52

as 0 96 52
an 0 96 52
Archdiocesan 0 96 52
spokesman 0 96 52
now 0 96 52
confirms, 0 96 52
at 0 96 52
Viganò’s 0 96 52
request 0 96 52
as 0 96 52
then 0 96 52
papal 0 96 52
nuncio 0 96 52
Wuerl 0 96 52

before 0 96 52

The 0 96 53
Herald 0 96 53
asks 0 96 53
the 0 96 53
obvious 0 96 53
question: 0 96 53
“[I]f 1 96 53
Cardinal 1 96 53
Wuerl 1 96 53
was 1 96 53
unaware 1 96 53
of 1 96 53
the 1 96 53
sanctions, 1 96 53
and 1 96 53
unaware 1 96 53
of 1 96 53
the 1 96 53
reason 1 96 53
for 1 96 53
them, 1 96 53
why 1 96 53
did 1 96 53
he 1 96 53
ask 1 96 53
no 1 96 53
questions 1 96 53

for 1 96 53
his 1 96 53
demand?” 1 96 53
The 0 96 53
question 0 96 53
answers 0 96 53
itself, 0 96 53
and 0 96 53
Viganò’s 0 96 53
testimony 0 96 53
on 0 96 53
this 0 96 53
critical 0 96 53
point 0 96 53
stands 0 96 53
confirmed 0 96 53
by 0 96 53
Wuerl’s 0 96 53
own 0 96 53
spokesman. 0 96 53

Bergoglio 0 96 54
Pleads 0 96 54
the 0 96 54
Fifth 0 96 54

Bergoglio 0 96 55
himself, 0 96 55
however, 0 96 55
has 0 96 55
already 0 96 55
precluded 0 96 55
any 0 96 55
attempt 0 96 55
to 0 96 55
impeach 0 96 55
Viganò’s 0 96 55

During 0 96 56
the 0 96 56
return 0 96 56
flight 0 96 56
from 0 96 56
Dublin 0 96 56
after 0 96 56
the 0 96 56
“World 0 96 56
Meeting 0 96 56
of 0 96 56
Familes,” 0 96 56
he 0 96 56
was 0 96 56
asked 0 96 56
to 0 96 56
comment 0 96 56
on 0 96 56
Viganò 0 96 56
’s 0 96 56
allegations 0 96 56
that 0 96 56
he 0 96 56
had 0 96 56
informed 0 96 56
Bergoglio 0 96 56
of 0 96 56
McCarrick’s 0 96 56
crimes 0 96 56
in 0 96 56
2013 0 96 56
as 0 96 56
well 0 96 56
as 0 96 56
the 0 96 56
sanctions 0 96 56
imposed 0 96 56
by 0 96 56
Benedict. 0 96 56

Bergoglio 0 96 57
declined 0 96 57
to 0 96 57
incriminate 0 96 57
himself: 0 96 57

Read 0 96 58
the 0 96 58
statement 0 96 58
carefully 0 96 58
yourselves 0 96 58
and 0 96 58
make 0 96 58
your 0 96 58
own 0 96 58
judgment. 0 96 58

I 0 96 59
am 0 96 59
not 0 96 59
going 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
say 0 96 59
a 0 96 59
word 0 96 59
about 0 96 59
this. 0 96 59

I 0 96 60
believe 0 96 60
that 0 96 60
the 0 96 60
statement 0 96 60
speaks 0 96 60
for 0 96 60
itself, 0 96 60
and 0 96 60
you 0 96 60
all 0 96 60
have 0 96 60
sufficient 0 96 60
journalistic 0 96 60
ability 0 96 60
to 0 96 60
draw 0 96 60
conclusions. 0 96 60

It 0 96 61
is 0 96 61
an 0 96 61
act 0 96 61
of 0 96 61
trust. 0 96 61

When 0 96 62
a 0 96 62
little 0 96 62
time 0 96 62
goes 0 96 62
by, 0 96 62
and 0 96 62
you 0 96 62
have 0 96 62
drawn 0 96 62
conclusions, 0 96 62
perhaps 0 96 62
I 0 96 62
will 0 96 62
speak 0 96 62
about 0 96 62
it, 0 96 62
but 0 96 62
I 0 96 62
would 0 96 62
like 0 96 62
your 0 96 62
professional 0 96 62
maturity 0 96 62
to 0 96 62
do 0 96 62
this 0 96 62
work. 0 96 62

It 0 96 63
will 0 96 63
do 0 96 63
you 0 96 63
all 0 96 63
good, 0 96 63
really. 0 96 63

In 0 96 64
other 0 96 64
words, 0 96 64
as 1 96 64
Bergoglio 1 96 64
cannot 1 96 64
deny 1 96 64
the 1 96 64
allegations 1 96 64
without 1 96 64
lying, 1 96 64
he 1 96 64
will 1 96 64
say 1 96 64
nothing 1 96 64
at 1 96 64
all 1 96 64
about 1 96 64
them 1 96 64
in 1 96 64
the 1 96 64
hope 1 96 64
they 1 96 64
will 1 96 64
go 1 96 64
away—with 0 96 64
the 0 96 64
help 0 96 64
of 0 96 64
sycophants 1 96 64
in 1 96 64
the 1 96 64
Vatican 1 96 64
press 1 96 64
corps 1 96 64
and 1 96 64
shifty 1 96 64
polemicists 1 96 64
like 0 96 64
Shea, 0 96 64
who 0 96 64
expects 1 96 64
his 1 96 64
readers 1 96 64
to 1 96 64
swallow 1 96 64
his 1 96 64
explanation 1 96 64
that 0 96 64
Bergoglio’s 0 96 64
refusal 0 96 64
to 0 96 64
say 0 96 64
anything 0 96 64
in 0 96 64
his 0 96 64
defense 0 96 64
when 0 96 64
asked 0 96 64
point 0 96 64
blank 0 96 64
about 0 96 64
the 0 96 64
charges 0 96 64
against 0 96 64
him 0 96 64
“seems 0 96 64
to 0 96 64
me 0 96 64
to 0 96 64
obviously 0 96 64
be 0 96 64
the 0 96 64
reply 0 96 64
of 0 96 64
somebody 0 96 64
who 0 96 64
believes 0 96 64
the 0 96 64
accusations 0 96 64
are 0 96 64
groundless…”. 0 96 64

Seems 0 96 65
to 0 96 65
be. 0 96 65

Obviously. 0 96 66

Expansion 0 96 67

While 0 96 68
events 0 96 68
have 0 96 68
overtaken 0 96 68
Faggioli’s 0 96 68
piece, 0 96 68
it 0 96 68
will 0 96 68
remain 0 96 68
useful 0 96 68
here 0 96 68
as 0 96 68
a 0 96 68
prime 0 96 68
example 0 96 68
of 0 96 68
the 0 96 68
neo-Catholic 0 96 68
polemic. 0 96 68

That 0 96 69
polemic 0 96 69
seeks 0 96 69
to 0 96 69
shore 0 96 69
up 0 96 69
the 0 96 69
collapsing 0 96 69
Novus 0 96 69
Ordo 0 96 69
establishment 0 96 69
lest 0 96 69
it 0 96 69
give 0 96 69
way 0 96 69
to 0 96 69
the 1 96 69
dreaded 1 96 69
traditionalist 1 96 69
revival. 1 96 69

But 0 96 70
before 0 96 70
I 0 96 70
address 0 96 70
Faggioli’s 0 96 70
latest 0 96 70
defense 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
the 0 96 70
indefensible, 0 96 70
some 0 96 70
background 0 96 70
is 0 96 70
in 0 96 70
order, 0 96 70
including 0 96 70
a 0 96 70
discussion 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
further 0 96 70
key 0 96 70
details 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
Viganò’s 0 96 70
testimony. 0 96 70

First 0 96 71
of 0 96 71
all, 0 96 71
as 0 96 71
I 0 96 71
predicted 0 96 71
16 0 96 71
years 0 96 71
ago, 0 96 71
because 0 96 71
the 0 96 71
Vatican 0 96 71
under 0 96 71
John 0 96 71
Paul 0 96 71
II 0 96 71
had 0 96 71
no 0 96 71
intention 0 96 71
of 0 96 71
enforcing 0 96 71
the 0 96 71
pre-conciliar 0 96 71
ban 0 96 71
on 0 96 71
admission 0 96 71
of 0 96 71
homosexuals 0 96 71
to 0 96 71
the 0 96 71
seminary 0 96 71
“a 0 96 71
new 1 96 71
bumper 1 96 71
crop 1 96 71
of 1 96 71
homosexual 1 96 71
ordinands 1 96 71
is 0 96 71
guaranteed—and 0 96 71
with 0 96 71
it 0 96 71
a 1 96 71
new 1 96 71
harvest 1 96 71
of 1 96 71
scandal 1 96 71
for 1 96 71
the 1 96 71
Church.” 1 96 71
That 0 96 71
prediction 0 96 71
came 0 96 71
immediately 0 96 71
after 0 96 71
the 1 96 71
“pedophile 1 96 71
summit” 1 96 71
of 1 96 71
2002 1 96 71
in 1 96 71
Rome, 1 96 71
which 0 96 71
I 0 96 71
attended 0 96 71
as 0 96 71
The 0 96 71
Remnant’s 0 96 71
correspondent. 0 96 71

In 0 96 72
answer 0 96 72
to 0 96 72
my 0 96 72
question 0 96 72
then 0 96 72
head 0 96 72
of 0 96 72
the 0 96 72
USCCB, 0 96 72
Wilton 0 96 72
Gregory, 0 96 72
made 0 96 72
an 1 96 72
explosive 1 96 72
admission 1 96 72
reportedby 0 96 72
the 0 96 72
international 0 96 72
press: 0 96 72
“it 0 96 72
is 0 96 72
an 0 96 72
ongoing 0 96 72
struggle 0 96 72
to 0 96 72
make 0 96 72
sure 0 96 72
that 0 96 72
the 0 96 72
Catholic 0 96 72
priesthood 0 96 72
is 0 96 72
not 0 96 72
dominated 0 96 72
by 0 96 72
homosexual 0 96 72
men.” 0 96 72
The 1 96 72
struggle, 1 96 72
to 1 96 72
the 1 96 72
extent 1 96 72
there 1 96 72
even 1 96 72
was 1 96 72
one, 1 96 72
obviously 1 96 72
has 1 96 72
been 1 96 72
lost. 1 96 72

Sixteen 0 96 73
years 0 96 73
later, 0 96 73
the 1 96 73
homosexual 1 96 73
predator 1 96 73
McCarrick 0 96 73
has 0 96 73
finally 0 96 73
been 0 96 73
exposed 0 96 73
to 0 96 73
the 0 96 73
world, 0 96 73
stripped 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
his 0 96 73
cardinal’s 0 96 73
hat 0 96 73
and 0 96 73
deprived 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
any 0 96 73
ministry, 0 96 73
but 0 96 73
only 0 96 73
after 0 96 73
international 0 96 73
media 0 96 73
coverage 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
the 0 96 73
Vatican’s 0 96 73
semi-secret 0 96 73
finding 0 96 73
that 0 96 73
McCarrick 0 96 73
had 0 96 73
raped 0 96 73
a 0 96 73
teenage 0 96 73
altar 0 96 73
boy 0 96 73
47 0 96 73
years 0 96 73
ago. 0 96 73

If 0 96 74
not 0 96 74
for 0 96 74
that 0 96 74
one 0 96 74
case, 0 96 74
McCarrick’s 0 96 74
sixty 0 96 74
years 0 96 74
of 0 96 74
homosexual 1 96 74
debauchery 1 96 74
might 0 96 74
well 0 96 74
have 0 96 74
gone 0 96 74
unpunished 0 96 74
in 0 96 74
this 0 96 74
world 0 96 74
and 0 96 74
he 0 96 74
would 0 96 74
have 0 96 74
died 0 96 74
still 0 96 74
possessed 0 96 74
of 0 96 74
all 0 96 74
the 0 96 74
phony 1 96 74
honors 1 96 74
that 0 96 74
had 0 96 74
been 0 96 74
heaped 0 96 74
upon 0 96 74
him 0 96 74
throughout 0 96 74
his 0 96 74
career 0 96 74
as 0 96 74
a 1 96 74
parasite 1 96 74
in 1 96 74
the 1 96 74
Body 1 96 74
of 1 96 74
Christ, 1 96 74
including 0 96 74
the 0 96 74
favor 0 96 74
shown 0 96 74
to 0 96 74
him 0 96 74
by 0 96 74
Bergoglio. 0 96 74

The 0 96 75
telling 0 96 75
details 0 96 75
of 0 96 75
Archbishop 0 96 75
Viganò’s 0 96 75
testimony 0 96 75
concerning 0 96 75
Bergoglio’s 0 96 75
friendly 0 96 75
relations 0 96 75
with 0 96 75
McCarrick 0 96 75
before 0 96 75
he 0 96 75
finally 0 96 75
had 0 96 75
to 0 96 75
cut 0 96 75
him 0 96 75
loose—details 1 96 75
conveniently 1 96 75
ignored 1 96 75
by 1 96 75
Winters, 1 96 75
Allen 1 96 75
and 1 96 75
Shea—are 1 96 75
utterly 1 96 75
devastating 1 96 75
to 0 96 75
any 0 96 75
defense 0 96 75
of 0 96 75
Bergoglio. 0 96 75

This 0 96 76
would 0 96 76
explain 0 96 76
why 0 96 76
he 0 96 76
will 0 96 76
not 0 96 76
a 0 96 76
“say 0 96 76
a 0 96 76
word 0 96 76
about” 0 96 76
Viganò’s 0 96 76
charges 0 96 76
against 0 96 76
him. 0 96 76

The 0 96 77
Archbishop 0 96 77
reveals, 0 96 77
as 0 96 77
already 0 96 77
noted, 0 96 77
that 0 96 77
Pope 0 96 77
Benedict 0 96 77
imposed 0 96 77
sanctions 0 96 77
on 0 96 77
McCarrick 0 96 77
under 0 96 77
which 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
“was 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
leave 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
seminary 0 96 77
where 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
was 0 96 77

lectures, 0 96 77
to 0 96 77

with 0 96 77
the 0 96 77

of 0 96 77
prayer 0 96 77
and 0 96 77
penance.” 0 96 77
Viganò 0 96 77
further 0 96 77
reveals 0 96 77
that 0 96 77
those 0 96 77
sanctions 0 96 77
were 0 96 77
communicated 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
McCarrick 0 96 77
by 0 96 77
then 0 96 77
Apostolic 0 96 77
Nuncio 0 96 77
to 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
United 0 96 77
States, 0 96 77
Pietro 0 96 77
Sambi, 0 96 77
but 0 96 77
were 0 96 77
also 0 96 77
repeated 0 96 77
by 0 96 77
Viganò 0 96 77
himself 0 96 77
when 0 96 77
he 0 96 77
succeeded 0 96 77
Sambi 0 96 77
as 0 96 77
Nuncio: 0 96 77

I 0 96 78
repeated 0 96 78
them 0 96 78
to 0 96 78
Cardinal 0 96 78
McCarrick 0 96 78
at 0 96 78
my 0 96 78
first 0 96 78
meeting 0 96 78
with 0 96 78
him 0 96 78
at 0 96 78
the 0 96 78
Nunciature. 0 96 78

The 0 96 79
Cardinal, 0 96 79
muttering 1 96 79
in 1 96 79
a 1 96 79
barely 1 96 79
comprehensible 1 96 79
way, 1 96 79
admitted 0 96 79
that 0 96 79
he 0 96 79
had 0 96 79
perhaps 1 96 79
made 1 96 79
the 1 96 79
mistake 1 96 79
of 1 96 79
sleeping 1 96 79
in 1 96 79
the 1 96 79
same 1 96 79
bed 1 96 79
with 1 96 79
some 1 96 79
seminarians 1 96 79
at 1 96 79
his 1 96 79
beach 1 96 79
house, 1 96 79
but 0 96 79
he 0 96 79
said 0 96 79
this 0 96 79
as 0 96 79
if 0 96 79
it 0 96 79
had 0 96 79
no 0 96 79
importance. 0 96 79

Viganò 0 96 80
testifies 0 96 80
that 0 96 80
on 0 96 80
June 0 96 80
23, 0 96 80
2013, 0 96 80
he 0 96 80
obtained 0 96 80
a 0 96 80
private 0 96 80
audience 0 96 80
with 0 96 80
Bergoglio 0 96 80
after 0 96 80
having 0 96 80
encountered 0 96 80
McCarrick 0 96 80
at 0 96 80
the 0 96 80
Pope’s 0 96 80
residence 0 96 80
three 0 96 80
days 0 96 80
earlier, 0 96 80
during 0 96 80
which 0 96 80
encounter 0 96 80
McCarrick 0 96 80
had 0 96 80
told 0 96 80
him 0 96 80
with 0 96 80
an 0 96 80
air 0 96 80
of 0 96 80
triumph: 0 96 80
“The 0 96 80
Pope 0 96 80
received 0 96 80
me 0 96 80
yesterday, 0 96 80
tomorrow 0 96 80
I 0 96 80
am 0 96 80
going 0 96 80
to 0 96 80
China” 0 96 80
(evidently 0 96 80
to 0 96 80
assist 0 96 80
in 0 96 80
negotiating 0 96 80
Bergoglio’s 0 96 80
planned 1 96 80
sellout 1 96 80
of 0 96 80
China’s 1 96 80
underground 1 96 80
Catholics 1 96 80
to 0 96 80
the 0 96 80
Communist 1 96 80
dictators 1 96 80
of 1 96 80
Beijing). 1 96 80

Viganò 0 96 81
wanted 0 96 81
to 0 96 81
know 0 96 81
why 0 96 81
McCarrick 0 96 81
had 0 96 81
apparently 0 96 81
been 0 96 81
relieved 0 96 81
of 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
sanctions. 0 96 81

During 0 96 82
the 0 96 82
audience 0 96 82
Bergoglio 0 96 82
queried: 0 96 82
“What 0 96 82
is 0 96 82
Cardinal 0 96 82
McCarrick 0 96 82
like?” 0 96 82
and 0 96 82
Viganò 0 96 82
replied 0 96 82
with 0 96 82
the 0 96 82
truth 0 96 82
Bergoglio 0 96 82
obviously 0 96 82
did 0 96 82
not 0 96 82
want 0 96 82
to 0 96 82
hear: 0 96 82

I 0 96 83
answered 0 96 83
him 0 96 83
with 0 96 83
complete 0 96 83
frankness 0 96 83
and, 0 96 83
if 0 96 83
you 0 96 83
want, 0 96 83
with 0 96 83
great 0 96 83
naiveté: 0 96 83
“Holy 0 96 83
Father, 0 96 83
I 0 96 83
don’t 0 96 83
know 0 96 83
if 0 96 83
you 0 96 83
know 0 96 83
Cardinal 0 96 83
McCarrick, 0 96 83
but 0 96 83
if 0 96 83
you 0 96 83
ask 0 96 83
the 0 96 83
Congregation 0 96 83
for 0 96 83
Bishops 0 96 83
there 0 96 83
is 0 96 83
a 0 96 83
dossier 0 96 83
this 0 96 83
thick 0 96 83
about 0 96 83
him. 0 96 83

He 0 96 84
corrupted 0 96 84
generations 0 96 84
of 0 96 84
seminarians 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
priests 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
Pope 0 96 84
Benedict 0 96 84
ordered 0 96 84
him 0 96 84
to 0 96 84
withdraw 0 96 84
to 0 96 84
a 0 96 84
life 0 96 84
of 0 96 84
prayer 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
penance.” 0 96 84
The 0 96 84
Pope 0 96 84
did 0 96 84
not 0 96 84
make 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
slightest 0 96 84
comment 0 96 84
about 0 96 84
those 0 96 84
very 1 96 84
grave 1 96 84
words 1 96 84
of 1 96 84
mine 1 96 84
and 0 96 84
did 0 96 84
not 0 96 84
show 0 96 84
any 0 96 84
expression 0 96 84
of 0 96 84
surprise 0 96 84
on 0 96 84
his 0 96 84
face, 0 96 84
as 0 96 84
if 0 96 84
he 0 96 84
had 0 96 84
already 0 96 84
known 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
matter 0 96 84
for 0 96 84
some 0 96 84
time, 0 96 84
and 0 96 84
he 0 96 84
immediately 0 96 84
changed 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
subject. 0 96 84

But 0 96 85
then, 0 96 85
what 0 96 85
was 0 96 85
the 0 96 85
Pope’s 0 96 85
purpose 0 96 85
in 0 96 85
asking 0 96 85
me 0 96 85
that 0 96 85
question: 0 96 85
“What 0 96 85
is 0 96 85
Cardinal 0 96 85
McCarrick 0 96 85
like?” 0 96 85
He 1 96 85
clearly 1 96 85
wanted 1 96 85
to 1 96 85
find 1 96 85
out 1 96 85
if 1 96 85
I 1 96 85
was 1 96 85
an 1 96 85
ally 1 96 85
of 1 96 85
McCarrick 1 96 85
or 1 96 85
not…. 1 96 85

It 0 96 86
was 0 96 86
also 0 96 86
clear 0 96 86
that, 0 96 86
from 0 96 86
the 0 96 86
time 0 96 86
of 0 96 86
Pope 0 96 86
Francis’s 0 96 86
election, 0 96 86
McCarrick, 0 96 86
now 0 96 86
free 0 96 86
from 0 96 86
all 0 96 86
constraints, 0 96 86
had 0 96 86
felt 0 96 86
free 0 96 86
to 0 96 86
travel 0 96 86
continuously, 0 96 86
to 0 96 86
give 0 96 86
lectures 0 96 86
and 0 96 86
interviews…. 0 96 86

He 0 96 87
[Bergoglio] 0 96 87
knew 0 96 87
from 0 96 87
at 0 96 87
least 0 96 87
June 0 96 87
23, 0 96 87
2013 0 96 87
[the 0 96 87
date 0 96 87
of 0 96 87
the 0 96 87
audience 0 96 87
with 0 96 87
Viganò] 0 96 87
that 0 96 87
McCarrick 0 96 87
was 0 96 87
a 1 96 87
serial 1 96 87
predator. 1 96 87

Although 0 96 88
he 0 96 88
knew 0 96 88
that 0 96 88
he 0 96 88
was 0 96 88
a 0 96 88
corrupt 1 96 88
man, 1 96 88
he 0 96 88
covered 0 96 88
for 0 96 88
him 0 96 88
to 1 96 88
the 1 96 88
bitter 1 96 88
end; 1 96 88
indeed, 0 96 88
he 0 96 88
made 0 96 88
McCarrick’s 0 96 88
advice 0 96 88
his 0 96 88
own, 0 96 88
which 0 96 88
was 0 96 88
certainly 0 96 88
not 0 96 88
inspired 0 96 88
by 0 96 88
sound 0 96 88
intentions 0 96 88
and 0 96 88
for 0 96 88
love 0 96 88
of 0 96 88
the 0 96 88
Church. 0 96 88

It 0 96 89
was 0 96 89
only 0 96 89
when 0 96 89
he 0 96 89
was 0 96 89
forced 0 96 89
by 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
report 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
abuse 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
a 0 96 89
minor, 0 96 89
again 0 96 89
on 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
basis 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
media 0 96 89
attention, 0 96 89
that 0 96 89
he 0 96 89
took 0 96 89
action 0 96 89
to 0 96 89
save 0 96 89
his 0 96 89
image 0 96 89
in 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
media. 0 96 89

[all 0 96 90
emphasis 0 96 90
in 0 96 90
original] 0 96 90

Before 0 96 91
his 0 96 91
long 0 96 91
overdue 0 96 91
fall 0 96 91
McCarrick, 0 96 91
as 0 96 91
Bergoglio’s 1 96 91
“trusted 1 96 91
counselor,” 1 96 91
had 0 96 91
been 0 96 91
instrumental 0 96 91
in 0 96 91
cementing 0 96 91
into 0 96 91
place 0 96 91
the 0 96 91
homosexual-friendly 0 96 91
status 0 96 91
quo 0 96 91
of 0 96 91
the 0 96 91
American 0 96 91
episcopate 0 96 91
that 0 96 91
oppresses 0 96 91
and 0 96 91
defrauds 0 96 91
the 0 96 91
faithful. 0 96 91

It 0 96 92
was 0 96 92
McCarrick, 0 96 92
noted 0 96 92
Marco 0 96 92
Tosatti, 0 96 92
who 0 96 92
was 0 96 92
behind 0 96 92
the 0 96 92
elevation 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Blase 0 96 92
Cupich 0 96 92
to 0 96 92
the 0 96 92
key 0 96 92
position 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Archbishop 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Chicago, 0 96 92
where 0 96 92
Cupich 0 96 92
has 0 96 92
since 0 96 92
promoted 0 96 92
the 0 96 92
homosexual 0 96 92
subversion 0 96 92
of 0 96 92
Father 0 96 92
James 0 96 92
Martin. 0 96 92

And 0 96 93
Viganò 0 96 93
now 0 96 93
confirms 0 96 93
Tosatti’s 0 96 93
allegation: 0 96 93
“The 0 96 93
appointments 0 96 93
of 0 96 93
Blase 0 96 93
Cupich 0 96 93
to 0 96 93
Chicago 0 96 93
and 0 96 93
Joseph 0 96 93
W. 0 96 93
Tobin 0 96 93
to 0 96 93
Newark 0 96 93
were 0 96 93
orchestrated 0 96 93
by 0 96 93
McCarrick, 0 96 93
Maradiaga 0 96 93
and 0 96 93
Wuerl, 0 96 93
united 1 96 93
by 1 96 93
a 1 96 93
wicked 1 96 93
pact 1 96 93
of 1 96 93
abuses 1 96 93
by 1 96 93
the 1 96 93
first, 1 96 93
and 1 96 93
at 1 96 93
least 1 96 93
of 1 96 93
coverup 1 96 93
of 1 96 93
abuses 1 96 93
by 1 96 93
the 1 96 93
other 1 96 93
two. 1 96 93

Their 0 96 94
names 0 96 94
were 0 96 94
not 0 96 94
among 0 96 94
those 0 96 94
presented 0 96 94
by 0 96 94
the 0 96 94
Nunciature 0 96 94
for 0 96 94
Chicago 0 96 94
and 0 96 94
Newark.” 0 96 94
That 0 96 94
is, 0 96 94
the 0 96 94
normal 0 96 94
process 0 96 94
was 0 96 94
circumvented 0 96 94
for 0 96 94
these 0 96 94
appointments. 0 96 94

Remnant 0 96 95
readers 0 96 95
may 0 96 95
recall 0 96 95
that 0 96 95
I 0 96 95
spotted 0 96 95
Cupich 0 96 95
back 0 96 95
in 0 96 95
2002, 0 96 95
when 0 96 95
he 0 96 95
was 0 96 95
the 1 96 95
obscure 1 96 95
Bishop 1 96 95
of 1 96 95
Rapid 1 96 95
City, 1 96 95
South 0 96 95
Dakota, 0 96 95
as 0 96 95
an 0 96 95
example 0 96 95
of 0 96 95
what 0 96 95
was 0 96 95
coming 0 96 95
in 0 96 95
the 0 96 95
Novus 0 96 95
Ordo: 0 96 95
accelerated 1 96 95
degeneration. 1 96 95

As 0 96 96
I 0 96 96
wrote 0 96 96
back 0 96 96
then, 0 96 96
with 0 96 96
the 0 96 96
likes 0 96 96
of 0 96 96
Cupich 0 96 96
in 0 96 96
view: 0 96 96

Cupich 0 96 97
is 0 96 97
the 0 96 97
very 0 96 97
model 0 96 97
of 0 96 97
a 0 96 97
Novus 0 96 97
Ordo 0 96 97
bishop. 0 96 97

He 1 96 98
is 1 96 98
the 1 96 98
very 1 96 98
exemplar 1 96 98
of 1 96 98
the 1 96 98
crisis 1 96 98
we 1 96 98
must 1 96 98
still 1 96 98
endure…. 1 96 98

Let 0 96 99
the 0 96 99
thing 0 96 99
die 0 96 99
of 0 96 99
its 0 96 99
own 0 96 99
excesses, 0 96 99
for 0 96 99
as 0 96 99
the 0 96 99
“little 0 96 99
synod” 0 96 99
[the 1 96 99
2002 1 96 99
“pedophile 1 96 99
summit”] 1 96 99
demonstrates, 0 96 99
the 1 96 99
men 1 96 99
who 1 96 99
control 1 96 99
this 1 96 99
establishment 1 96 99
will 1 96 99
never 1 96 99
restore 1 96 99
it 1 96 99
to 1 96 99
anything 1 96 99
resembling 1 96 99
the 1 96 99
vibrant 1 96 99
Church 1 96 99
that 1 96 99
a 1 96 99
long 1 96 99
line 1 96 99
of 1 96 99
militant, 1 96 99
uncompromising 1 96 99
Popes 1 96 99
delivered 1 96 99

their 1 96 99
hands 1 96 99
at 1 96 99
Vatican 1 96 99
II. 1 96 99

For 1 96 100
heaven’s 1 96 100
sake, 1 96 100
the 0 96 100
men 0 96 100
who 0 96 100
govern 0 96 100
the 0 96 100
Church 0 96 100
today 0 96 100

From 0 96 101
the 0 96 101
Vatican 0 96 101
on 0 96 101
down, 0 96 101
through 0 96 101

and 0 96 101
criminal 0 96 101

the 1 96 101
servitors 1 96 101
of 1 96 101
Vatican 1 96 101
II 1 96 101
have 1 96 101
laid 1 96 101

the 0 96 101

of 0 96 101
Catholic 0 96 101

the 0 96 101
Church’s 0 96 101
militant 0 96 101
opposition 0 96 101
to 0 96 101

short, 0 96 101
the 0 96 101
very 0 96 101
life 0 96 101
of 0 96 101
the 0 96 101

dare 0 96 101
to 0 96 101
call 0 96 101
it 0 96 101
a 0 96 101
renewal. 0 96 101

We 1 96 102
must 1 96 102
no 1 96 102
longer 1 96 102
subsidize 1 96 102
the 1 96 102
malpractice 1 96 102
of 1 96 102
the 1 96 102
architects 1 96 102
of 1 96 102
ruin. 1 96 102

Nor 1 96 103
must 1 96 103
we 1 96 103
join 1 96 103
the 1 96 103
neo-Catholics 1 96 103
in 1 96 103
their 1 96 103
mindless 1 96 103
applause 1 96 103
when 1 96 103
one 1 96 103
of 1 96 103
these 1 96 103
incompetents 1 96 103
attempts 1 96 103
to 1 96 103
repoint 1 96 103
a 1 96 103
brick 1 96 103
or 1 96 103
two 1 96 103
in 1 96 103
the 1 96 103
crumbling 1 96 103
façade 1 96 103

have 1 96 103
erected 1 96 103
to 1 96 103
obscure 1 96 103
the 1 96 103
Church 1 96 103
of 1 96 103
old. 1 96 103

As 0 96 104
for 0 96 104
William 1 96 104
(“nighty-night 1 96 104
baby!”) 1 96 104
Tobin, 1 96 104
after 0 96 104
McCarrick 0 96 104
had 0 96 104
arranged 0 96 104
for 0 96 104
him 0 96 104
to 0 96 104
become 0 96 104
Archbishop 0 96 104
of 0 96 104
Newark, 0 96 104
Tobin, 0 96 104
another 1 96 104
episcopal 1 96 104
booster 1 96 104
of 1 96 104
Martin’s 1 96 104
pro-homosexual 1 96 104
propaganda, 1 96 104
promptly 0 96 104
sponsored 0 96 104
a 0 96 104
“gay 0 96 104
pilgrimage” 0 96 104
to 0 96 104
his 0 96 104
cathedral 0 96 104
in 0 96 104
Newark. 0 96 104

And 0 96 105
it 0 96 105
was 0 96 105
McCarrick 0 96 105
who 0 96 105
obtained 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
cardinal’s 0 96 105
hat 0 96 105
for 0 96 105
his 0 96 105
roommate 0 96 105
of 0 96 105
six 0 96 105
years, 0 96 105
Kevin 0 96 105
Farrell, 0 96 105
whom 0 96 105
he 0 96 105
consecrated 0 96 105
a 0 96 105
bishop. 0 96 105

Farrell, 0 96 106
yet 1 96 106
another 1 96 106
promoter 1 96 106
of 1 96 106
Martin’s 1 96 106
homosexual 1 96 106
activism, 1 96 106
arranged 0 96 106
for 0 96 106
Martin 0 96 106
to 0 96 106
“welcome 0 96 106

in 0 96 106
Dublin 0 96 106
from 0 96 106
which 0 96 106
Bergoglio 0 96 106
has 0 96 106
just 0 96 106
returned. 0 96 106

Finally, 0 96 107
there 0 96 107
is 0 96 107
the 0 96 107
appointment 0 96 107
of 0 96 107
the 0 96 107
“pro-gay” 1 96 107
Robert 1 96 107

Bishop 0 96 107
of 0 96 107

Diego, 0 96 107
concerning 0 96 107
which 0 96 107
Viganò 0 96 107
reveals: 0 96 107
“The 0 96 107

McElroy 0 96 107
in 0 96 107

Diego 0 96 107
was 0 96 107
also 0 96 107
orchestrated 0 96 107
from 0 96 107
above, 0 96 107
with 0 96 107

Like 0 96 107
Cupich, 0 96 107
Tobin 0 96 107
and 0 96 107
Farrell, 0 96 107
McElroy 0 96 107
is 0 96 107
an 1 96 107
avid 1 96 107
promoter 1 96 107
of 1 96 107
Martin’s 1 96 107
homosexual 1 96 107
subversion 1 96 107
of 1 96 107
the 1 96 107
Church, 1 96 107
calling 0 96 107
opposition 0 96 107
to 0 96 107
Martin 0 96 107
symptomatic 0 96 107
of 0 96 107
a 0 96 107
“cancer 1 96 107
of 1 96 107
vilification 1 96 107
[that] 0 96 107
is 0 96 107
seeping 0 96 107
into 0 96 107

institutional 0 96 107
life 0 96 107
of 0 96 107
the 0 96 107
church.” 0 96 107

Emboldened 0 96 108
by 0 96 108
the 0 96 108
certainty 0 96 108
that 0 96 108
he 0 96 108
will 0 96 108
face 0 96 108
no 0 96 108
discipline 0 96 108
whatsoever, 0 96 108
Martin, 0 96 108
now 0 96 108
backed 0 96 108
by 0 96 108
“Cupich, 0 96 108
Tobin, 0 96 108
Farrell 0 96 108
and 0 96 108
McElroy,” 0 96 108
as 0 96 108
Viganò 0 96 108
testifies, 0 96 108
is 0 96 108
urging 0 96 108
all 0 96 108
the 0 96 108
“gay 0 96 108
priests” 0 96 108
to 0 96 108
“come 0 96 108
out,” 0 96 108
including 0 96 108
those 0 96 108
ordained 0 96 108
since 0 96 108
the 0 96 108
useless 0 96 108
“pedophile 1 96 108
summit” 1 96 108
presided 0 96 108
over 0 96 108
by 0 96 108
none 0 96 108
other 0 96 108
than 0 96 108
McCarrick 0 96 108
as 0 96 108
the 1 96 108
classic 1 96 108
fox 1 96 108
in 1 96 108
charge 1 96 108
of 1 96 108
the 1 96 108
hen 1 96 108
house. 1 96 108

But 0 96 109
Bergoglio 0 96 109
has 0 96 109
also 0 96 109
lent 0 96 109
his 0 96 109
own 0 96 109
authority 0 96 109
to 0 96 109
Martin’s 0 96 109
effort 0 96 109
to 0 96 109
mainstream 0 96 109
homosexuality 0 96 109
in 0 96 109
the 0 96 109
Church. 0 96 109

As 0 96 110
Viganò 0 96 110
notes, 0 96 110
it 0 96 110
was 0 96 110
Bergoglio 0 96 110
who 0 96 110
made 0 96 110
Martin 0 96 110
a 0 96 110
“Consultor 0 96 110
of 0 96 110
the 0 96 110
Secretariat 0 96 110
for 0 96 110
Communications,” 0 96 110
even 0 96 110
though 0 96 110
he 0 96 110
is 0 96 110
a 1 96 110
“well-known 1 96 110
activist 1 96 110
who 1 96 110
promotes 1 96 110
the 1 96 110

agenda, 1 96 110
chosen 1 96 110
to 1 96 110
corrupt 1 96 110
the 1 96 110
young 1 96 110
people 1 96 110
who 1 96 110
will 1 96 110
soon 1 96 110
gather 1 96 110
in 1 96 110
Dublin 1 96 110
for 1 96 110
the 1 96 110
World 1 96 110
Meeting 1 96 110
of 1 96 110
Families…” 1 96 110

“Father” 0 96 111
Martin 0 96 111
now 0 96 111
confidently 0 96 111
declares, 0 96 111
sixteen 0 96 111
years 0 96 111
after 0 96 111
the 0 96 111
“pedophile 1 96 111
summit,” 1 96 111
that 0 96 111
“The 1 96 111
idea 1 96 111
of 1 96 111
a 1 96 111
purge 1 96 111
of 1 96 111
gay 1 96 111
priests 1 96 111
is 1 96 111
both 1 96 111
ridiculous 1 96 111
and 1 96 111
dangerous. 1 96 111

Any 1 96 112
purge 1 96 112
would 1 96 112
empty 1 96 112
parishes 1 96 112
and 1 96 112
religious 1 96 112
orders 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
the 1 96 112
thousands 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
priests 1 96 112
and 1 96 112
bishops 1 96 112
who 1 96 112
lead 1 96 112
healthy 1 96 112
lives 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
service 1 96 112
and 1 96 112
faithful 1 96 112
lives 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
celibacy.” 1 96 112

Martin 0 96 113
thus 0 96 113
revels 1 96 113
in 1 96 113
smug 1 96 113
certitude 1 96 113
that 0 96 113
the 0 96 113
future 0 96 113
of 0 96 113
the 0 96 113
universal 0 96 113
Church 0 96 113
is 0 96 113
in 0 96 113
the 0 96 113
hands 0 96 113
of 0 96 113
legions 1 96 113
of 1 96 113
intrinsically 1 96 113
disordered 1 96 113
homosexual 1 96 113
bishops 1 96 113
and 1 96 113
priests 1 96 113
and 0 96 113
their 0 96 113
homosexual 0 96 113
successors, 0 96 113
who 0 96 113
will 0 96 113
perpetuate 0 96 113
an 0 96 113
existing 0 96 113
worldwide 0 96 113
homosexual 0 96 113
network, 0 96 113
and 0 96 113
that 0 96 113
there 0 96 113
is 0 96 113
absolutely 0 96 113
nothing 0 96 113
we 0 96 113
can 0 96 113
or 0 96 113
should 0 96 113
do 0 96 113
about 0 96 113
it. 0 96 113

A 0 96 114
Worldwide 0 96 114
Network 0 96 114
of 0 96 114
Corruption, 0 96 114
Beginning 0 96 114
at 0 96 114
the 0 96 114
Top 0 96 114

None 0 96 115
of 0 96 115
the 0 96 115
foregoing 0 96 115
is 0 96 115
meant 0 96 115
to 0 96 115
suggest 0 96 115
that 0 96 115
the 0 96 115
homosexual 0 96 115
invasion 0 96 115
of 0 96 115
the 0 96 115
Catholic 0 96 115
hierarchy 0 96 115
is 0 96 115
confined 0 96 115
to 0 96 115
American 0 96 115
prelates 0 96 115
and 0 96 115
priests. 0 96 115

The 0 96 116
spread 0 96 116
of 0 96 116
clerical 1 96 116
sodomy 1 96 116
has 0 96 116
not 0 96 116
respected 0 96 116
national 0 96 116
boundaries 0 96 116
but 0 96 116
rather 0 96 116
extends 0 96 116
throughout 0 96 116
the 0 96 116
Church 0 96 116
under 0 96 116
the 0 96 116
eyes 0 96 116
of 0 96 116
a 0 96 116
Vatican 0 96 116
apparatus 0 96 116
that 0 96 116
is 0 96 116
itself 0 96 116
thoroughly 1 96 116
infested 1 96 116
with 1 96 116
homosexuals. 1 96 116

This 0 96 117
is 0 96 117
thanks 0 96 117
in 0 96 117
large 0 96 117
measure 0 96 117
to 0 96 117
Bergoglio, 0 96 117
who 0 96 117
made 0 96 117
a 1 96 117
flagrantly 1 96 117
active 1 96 117
homosexual, 1 96 117
Monsignor 0 96 117
Battista 0 96 117
Ricca, 0 96 117
“prelate 1 96 117
of 1 96 117
the 1 96 117
gay 1 96 117
lobby,” 1 96 117
no 0 96 117
less 0 96 117
than 0 96 117
head 0 96 117
of 0 96 117
his 0 96 117
papal 0 96 117
household. 0 96 117

Moreover, 0 96 118
it 0 96 118
was 0 96 118
Bergoglio’s 0 96 118
right 0 96 118
hand 0 96 118
man, 0 96 118
Cardinal 0 96 118
Maradiaga, 0 96 118
who 0 96 118
sheltered 0 96 118

of 0 96 118
Tegucigalpa, 0 96 118
from 0 96 118

Must 1 96 135
Resign.” 1 96 135

Nearly 0 96 136
three 0 96 136
years 0 96 136
ago, 0 96 136
seeing 0 96 136
what 0 96 136
was 0 96 136
certainly 0 96 136
coming 0 96 136
on 0 96 136
the 0 96 136
disastrous 1 96 136
course 0 96 136
Bergoglio 0 96 136
had 0 96 136
already 0 96 136
clearly 0 96 136
established, 0 96 136
this 0 96 136
newspaper 0 96 136
published 0 96 136
a 0 96 136
petition 0 96 136
which 0 96 136
states: 0 96 136
“We 0 96 136
your 0 96 136
subjects 0 96 136
respectfully 0 96 136
petition 0 96 136
Your 0 96 136
Holiness 0 96 136
to 0 96 136
change 0 96 136
course 0 96 136
for 0 96 136
the 0 96 136
good 0 96 136
of 0 96 136
the 0 96 136
Church 0 96 136
and 0 96 136
the 0 96 136
welfare 0 96 136
of 0 96 136
souls. 0 96 136

Failing 0 96 137
this, 0 96 137
would 0 96 137
it 0 96 137
not 0 96 137
be 0 96 137
better 0 96 137
for 0 96 137
Your 0 96 137
Holiness 0 96 137
to 0 96 137
renounce 0 96 137
the 0 96 137
Petrine 0 96 137
office 0 96 137
than 0 96 137
to 0 96 137
preside 0 96 137
over 0 96 137
what 0 96 137
threatens 0 96 137
to 0 96 137
be 0 96 137
a 0 96 137
catastrophic 1 96 137
compromise 1 96 137
of 0 96 137
the 0 96 137
Church’s 0 96 137
integrity?” 0 96 137
Our 0 96 137
petition 0 96 137
was 0 96 137
of 0 96 137
course 0 96 137
dismissed 0 96 137
as 0 96 137
“ridiculous” 1 96 137
by 0 96 137
the 0 96 137
neo-Catholic 0 96 137
commentariat. 0 96 137

Today, 0 96 138
our 0 96 138
ridiculous 0 96 138
suggestion 0 96 138
is 0 96 138
the 0 96 138
stuff 0 96 138
of 0 96 138
mainstream 0 96 138
news. 0 96 138

From 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
neo-Catholic 0 96 139
perspective, 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
events 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
recent 0 96 139
days 0 96 139
present 0 96 139
a 0 96 139
terrifying 1 96 139
prospect: 1 96 139
the 0 96 139
final 0 96 139
collapse 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
Novus 0 96 139
Ordo 0 96 139
establishment, 0 96 139
an 0 96 139
end 0 96 139
to 0 96 139
the 0 96 139
conciliar 0 96 139
aggiornamento 0 96 139
and 0 96 139
a 0 96 139
revival 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
integral 0 96 139
Tradition, 0 96 139
which 0 96 139
growing 0 96 139
numbers 0 96 139
of 0 96 139
young 0 96 139
people 0 96 139
are 0 96 139
seeking. 0 96 139

Hence 0 96 140
even 0 96 140
before 0 96 140
Archbishop 0 96 140
Viganò 0 96 140
had 0 96 140
come 0 96 140
forward, 0 96 140
commentators 0 96 140
like 0 96 140
Faggioli 0 96 140
were 0 96 140
already 0 96 140
sounding 1 96 140
the 1 96 140
neo-Catholic 1 96 140
air 1 96 140
raid 1 96 140
siren. 1 96 140

Faggioli 0 96 141
fretted 1 96 141
that 0 96 141
“[t]he 0 96 141
abuse 0 96 141
scandal 0 96 141
and 0 96 141
delegitimization 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
episcopate 0 96 141
has 0 96 141
created 0 96 141
a 0 96 141
great 0 96 141
power 0 96 141
vacuum 0 96 141
in 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
Church” 0 96 141
that 0 96 141
could 0 96 141
be 0 96 141
filled 0 96 141
by 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
“neo-traditionalist 0 96 141
Catholicism 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
younger 0 96 141
generations 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
American 0 96 141
Catholics” 0 96 141
who 0 96 141
“attack 0 96 141
American 0 96 141
bishops 0 96 141
and 0 96 141
cardinals 0 96 141
close 0 96 141
to 0 96 141
Pope 0 96 141
Francis.” 0 96 141
Accordingly, 0 96 141
he 0 96 141
rushed 0 96 141
to 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
defense 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
Bergoglio 0 96 141
and 0 96 141
his 1 96 141
corrupt 1 96 141
regime 1 96 141
against 0 96 141
“a 0 96 141
radicalization 0 96 141
of 0 96 141
religious 0 96 141
conservatism 0 96 141
in 0 96 141
the 0 96 141
neo-traditionalism 0 96 141
sense...” 0 96 141

For 1 96 142
Faggioli, 1 96 142
not 1 96 142
only 1 96 142
would 1 96 142
Bergoglio’s 1 96 142
resignation 1 96 142
be 1 96 142
unthinkable, 1 96 142
so 1 96 142
also 1 96 142
would 1 96 142
a 1 96 142
purge 1 96 142
of 1 96 142
the 1 96 142
homosexual 1 96 142
and 1 96 142
pro-homosexual 1 96 142
prelates 1 96 142
Bergoglio 1 96 142
and 1 96 142
his 1 96 142
Vatican 1 96 142
henchmen 1 96 142
have 1 96 142
systematically 1 96 142
enabled. 1 96 142

The 0 96 143
Pope, 0 96 143
he 0 96 143
argues, 0 96 143
is 0 96 143
not 0 96 143
“the 1 96 143
CEO 1 96 143
of 1 96 143
the 1 96 143
Catholic 1 96 143
Church 1 96 143
world, 1 96 143
and 0 96 143
the 0 96 143
bishops 0 96 143
as 0 96 143
its 0 96 143
managers 0 96 143
whom 0 96 143
the 0 96 143
Pope 0 96 143
can 0 96 143
simply 0 96 143
fire.” 0 96 143
No, 0 96 143
Bergoglio 0 96 143
cannot 0 96 143
“simply 0 96 143
fire” 0 96 143
bishops. 0 96 143

Except 0 96 144
whenever 0 96 144
he 0 96 144
pleases, 0 96 144
as 0 96 144
we 0 96 144
have 0 96 144
seen 0 96 144
again 0 96 144
and 0 96 144
again 0 96 144
with 0 96 144
the 1 96 144
conservative 1 96 144
bishops 1 96 144
and 1 96 144
even 1 96 144
Cardinals 1 96 144
(Burke 1 96 144
and 1 96 144
Müller) 1 96 144
he 1 96 144
has 1 96 144
sacked 1 96 144
because 1 96 144
their 1 96 144
conservatism 1 96 144
offended 1 96 144
him 1 96 144
or 1 96 144
one 1 96 144
of 1 96 144
his 1 96 144
friends, 1 96 144
prompting 0 96 144
even 0 96 144
Crux 0 96 144
to 0 96 144
ask: 0 96 144
“Does 1 96 144
Pope 1 96 144
Francis 1 96 144
have 1 96 144
an 1 96 144
enemies 1 96 144
list?” 1 96 144
Then 0 96 144
again, 0 96 144
Francis 0 96 144
even 0 96 144
obtained 0 96 144
the 0 96 144
removal 0 96 144
of 0 96 144
his 0 96 144
own 0 96 144
“trusted 1 96 144
counselor” 1 96 144
McCarrick 1 96 144
from 0 96 144
the 0 96 144
College 0 96 144
of 0 96 144
Cardinals, 0 96 144
albeit 0 96 144
only 0 96 144
when 0 96 144
forced 0 96 144
to 0 96 144
act 0 96 144
due 0 96 144
to 0 96 144
worldwide 0 96 144
condemnation 0 96 144
in 0 96 144
the 0 96 144
media. 0 96 144

So, 0 96 145
according 0 96 145
to 0 96 145
Faggioli, 0 96 145
the 1 96 145
same 1 96 145
Pope 1 96 145
who 1 96 145
sacks 1 96 145
conservative 1 96 145
bishops 1 96 145
and 1 96 145
cardinals 1 96 145
according 1 96 145
to 1 96 145
his 1 96 145
pleasure 1 96 145
and 1 96 145
has 1 96 145
just 1 96 145
removed 1 96 145
a 1 96 145
cardinal 1 96 145
from 1 96 145
the 1 96 145
College 1 96 145
of 1 96 145
Cardinals 1 96 145
in 1 96 145
an 1 96 145
unprecedented 1 96 145
disciplinary 1 96 145
act 1 96 145
under 1 96 145
fire 1 96 145
from 1 96 145
the 1 96 145
media, 1 96 145
is 1 96 145
somehow 1 96 145
powerless 1 96 145
to 1 96 145
dismiss 1 96 145
Modernist 1 96 145
bishops 1 96 145
who 1 96 145
have 1 96 145
created 1 96 145
an 1 96 145
obscene 1 96 145
“gay 1 96 145
culture” 1 96 145
in 1 96 145
the 1 96 145
Church 1 96 145
and 1 96 145
replace 1 96 145
them 1 96 145
with 1 96 145
orthodox, 1 96 145
normal 1 96 145
heterosexual 1 96 145
males. 1 96 145

Francis 1 96 146
cannot 1 96 146
“simply 1 96 146
fire” 1 96 146
even 1 96 146
Cardinal 1 96 146
Wuerl, 1 96 146
who 1 96 146
covered 1 96 146
up 1 96 146
crimes 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
homosexual 1 96 146
predation 1 96 146
by 1 96 146
the 1 96 146
priests 1 96 146
he 1 96 146
transferred 1 96 146
elsewhere 1 96 146
while 1 96 146
Archbishop 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
Pittsburgh, 1 96 146
and 1 96 146
who 1 96 146
authorized 1 96 146
payment 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
$900,000 1 96 146
in 1 96 146
hush 1 96 146
money 1 96 146
to 1 96 146
bury 1 96 146
sexual 1 96 146
abuse 1 96 146
claims 1 96 146
against 1 96 146
a 1 96 146
homosexual 1 96 146
priest 1 96 146
involved 1 96 146
in 1 96 146
the 1 96 146
production 1 96 146
of 1 96 146
child 1 96 146
pornography. 1 96 146

Wuerl, 0 96 147
says 0 96 147
Faggioli, 0 96 147
“faces 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
complex 0 96 147
situation: 0 96 147
on 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
one 0 96 147
hand 0 96 147
Wuerl 0 96 147
was 0 96 147
not 0 96 147
afraid 0 96 147
of 0 96 147
clashing 0 96 147
with 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
tribunal 0 96 147
over 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
Apostolic 0 96 147
Signatura 0 96 147
in 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
Vatican 0 96 147
which 0 96 147
wanted 0 96 147
to 0 96 147
readmit 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
priest 0 96 147
from 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
Pittsburgh 0 96 147
diocese 0 96 147
to 0 96 147
ministry… 0 96 147
while 0 96 147
in 0 96 147
other 0 96 147
cases 0 96 147
he 0 96 147
seems 0 96 147
to 0 96 147
have 0 96 147
collaborated 0 96 147
in 0 96 147
covering 0 96 147
up 0 96 147
some 0 96 147
cases… 0 96 147
It 0 96 147
is 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
very 0 96 147
difficult 0 96 147
position 0 96 147
also 0 96 147
because 0 96 147
Wuerl 0 96 147
became 0 96 147
a 0 96 147
symbol… 0 96 147
beyond 0 96 147
the 0 96 147
specific 0 96 147
accusations 0 96 147
against 0 96 147
him, 0 96 147
from 0 96 147
which 0 96 147
he 0 96 147
could 0 96 147
not 0 96 147
publicly 0 96 147
defend 0 96 147
himself.” 0 96 147

In 0 96 148
other 0 96 148
words, 0 96 148
because 0 96 148
his 0 96 148
situation 0 96 148
is 0 96 148
“complex” 0 96 148
Wuerl, 0 96 148
unlike 0 96 148
McCarrick, 0 96 148
should 0 96 148
remain 0 96 148
a 0 96 148
cardinal 0 96 148
and 0 96 148
the 0 96 148
Archbishop 0 96 148
of 0 96 148
Washington, 0 96 148
DC, 0 96 148
thus 0 96 148
maintaining 1 96 148
a 1 96 148
key 1 96 148
bulwark 1 96 148
against 1 96 148
the 1 96 148
“neo-traditionalist” 1 96 148
threat. 1 96 148

Yet, 0 96 149
as 0 96 149
the 0 96 149
Pennsylvania 0 96 149
grand 0 96 149
jury 0 96 149
report 0 96 149
documents, 0 96 149
Wuerl 0 96 149
assisted 0 96 149
McCarrick 0 96 149
in 0 96 149
the 0 96 149
coverup 0 96 149
of 0 96 149
his 0 96 149
crimes 0 96 149
and 0 96 149
now 0 96 149
brazenly 1 96 149
lies 1 96 149
about 1 96 149
it. 1 96 149

Here 0 96 150
too 0 96 150
Viganò’s 0 96 150
testimony 0 96 150
sheds 1 96 150
light 1 96 150
on 1 96 150
the 1 96 150
darkness: 1 96 150

…. 0 96 151

I 0 96 152
myself 0 96 152
brought 0 96 152
up 0 96 152
the 0 96 152
subject 0 96 152
[of 0 96 152
McCarrick] 0 96 152
with 0 96 152
Cardinal 0 96 152
Wuerl 0 96 152
on 0 96 152
several 0 96 152
occasions, 0 96 152
and 0 96 152
I 0 96 152
certainly 0 96 152
didn’t 0 96 152
need 0 96 152
to 0 96 152
go 0 96 152
into 0 96 152
detail 0 96 152
because 0 96 152
it 0 96 152
was 0 96 152
immediately 0 96 152
clear 0 96 152
to 0 96 152
me 0 96 152
that 0 96 152
he 0 96 152
was 0 96 152
fully 0 96 152
aware 0 96 152
of 0 96 152
it. 0 96 152

I 0 96 153
also 0 96 153
remember 0 96 153
in 0 96 153
particular 0 96 153
the 0 96 153
fact 0 96 153
that 0 96 153
I 0 96 153
had 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
draw 0 96 153
his 0 96 153
attention 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
it, 0 96 153
because 0 96 153
I 0 96 153
realized 0 96 153
that 0 96 153
in 0 96 153
an 0 96 153
archdiocesan 0 96 153
publication, 0 96 153
on 0 96 153
the 0 96 153
back 0 96 153
cover 0 96 153
in 0 96 153
color, 0 96 153
there 0 96 153
was 0 96 153
an 0 96 153
announcement 0 96 153
inviting 0 96 153
young 0 96 153
men 0 96 153
who 0 96 153
thought 0 96 153
they 0 96 153
had 0 96 153
a 0 96 153
vocation 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
the 0 96 153
priesthood 0 96 153
to 0 96 153
a 0 96 153
meeting 0 96 153
with 0 96 153
Cardinal 0 96 153
McCarrick. 0 96 153

I 0 96 154
immediately 0 96 154
phoned 0 96 154
Cardinal 0 96 154
Wuerl, 0 96 154
who 0 96 154
expressed 0 96 154
his 0 96 154
surprise 0 96 154
to 0 96 154
me, 0 96 154
telling 0 96 154
me 0 96 154
that 0 96 154
he 0 96 154
knew 0 96 154
nothing 0 96 154
about 0 96 154
that 0 96 154
announcement 0 96 154
and 0 96 154
that 0 96 154
he 0 96 154
would 0 96 154
cancel 0 96 154
it. 0 96 154

If, 1 96 155
as 1 96 155
he 1 96 155
now 1 96 155
continues 1 96 155
to 1 96 155
state, 1 96 155
he 1 96 155
knew 1 96 155
nothing 1 96 155
of 1 96 155
the 1 96 155
abuses 1 96 155
committed 1 96 155
by 1 96 155
McCarrick 1 96 155
and 1 96 155
the 1 96 155
measures 1 96 155
taken 1 96 155
by 1 96 155
Pope 1 96 155
Benedict, 1 96 155
how 1 96 155
can 1 96 155
his 1 96 155
answer 1 96 155
be 1 96 155
explained? 1 96 155

His 0 96 156
recent 0 96 156
statements 0 96 156
that 0 96 156
he 0 96 156
knew 0 96 156
nothing 0 96 156
about 0 96 156
it, 0 96 156
even 0 96 156
though 0 96 156
at 0 96 156
first 0 96 156
he 0 96 156
cunningly 0 96 156
referred 0 96 156
to 0 96 156
compensation 0 96 156
for 0 96 156
the 0 96 156
two 0 96 156
victims, 0 96 156
are 0 96 156
absolutely 1 96 156
laughable. 1 96 156

The 0 96 157
Cardinal 0 96 157
lies 1 96 157
shamelessly 1 96 157
and 0 96 157
prevails 0 96 157
upon 0 96 157
his 0 96 157
Chancellor, 0 96 157
Monsignor 0 96 157
Antonicelli, 0 96 157
to 0 96 157
lie 0 96 157
as 0 96 157
well. 0 96 157

Cardinal 0 96 158
Wuerl 0 96 158
also 0 96 158
clearly 0 96 158
lied 0 96 158
on 0 96 158
another 0 96 158
occasion. 0 96 158

Following 0 96 159
a 0 96 159
morally 0 96 159
unacceptable 0 96 159
event 0 96 159
authorized 0 96 159
by 0 96 159
the 0 96 159
academic 0 96 159
authorities 0 96 159
of 0 96 159
Georgetown 0 96 159
University, 0 96 159
I 0 96 159
brought 0 96 159
it 0 96 159
to 0 96 159
the 0 96 159
attention 0 96 159
of 0 96 159
its 0 96 159
President, 0 96 159
Dr. 0 96 159
John 0 96 159
DeGioia, 0 96 159
sending 0 96 159
him 0 96 159
two 0 96 159
subsequent 0 96 159
letters. 0 96 159

Before 0 96 160
forwarding 0 96 160
them 0 96 160
to 0 96 160
the 0 96 160
addressee, 0 96 160
so 0 96 160
as 0 96 160
to 0 96 160
handle 0 96 160
things 0 96 160
properly, 0 96 160
I 0 96 160
personally 0 96 160
gave 0 96 160
a 0 96 160
copy 0 96 160
of 0 96 160
them 0 96 160
to 0 96 160
the 0 96 160
Cardinal 0 96 160
with 0 96 160
an 0 96 160
accompanying 0 96 160
letter 0 96 160
I 0 96 160
had 0 96 160
written. 0 96 160

The 0 96 161
Cardinal 0 96 161
told 0 96 161
me 0 96 161
that 0 96 161
he 0 96 161
knew 0 96 161
nothing 0 96 161
about 0 96 161
it. 0 96 161

However, 1 96 162
he 1 96 162
failed 1 96 162
to 1 96 162
acknowledge 1 96 162
receipt 1 96 162
of 1 96 162
my 1 96 162
two 1 96 162
letters, 1 96 162
contrary 1 96 162
to 1 96 162
what 1 96 162
he 1 96 162
customarily 1 96 162
did. 1 96 162

I 0 96 163
subsequently 0 96 163
learned 0 96 163
that 0 96 163
the 0 96 163
event 0 96 163
at 0 96 163
Georgetown 0 96 163
had 0 96 163
taken 0 96 163
place 0 96 163
for 0 96 163
seven 0 96 163
years. 0 96 163

But 0 96 164
the 0 96 164
Cardinal 0 96 164
knew 0 96 164
nothing 0 96 164
about 0 96 164
it! 0 96 164

Cardinal 0 96 165
Wuerl, 0 96 165
well 0 96 165
aware 0 96 165
of 0 96 165
the 0 96 165
continuous 0 96 165
abuses 0 96 165
committed 0 96 165
by 0 96 165
Cardinal 0 96 165
McCarrick 0 96 165
and 0 96 165
the 0 96 165
sanctions 0 96 165
imposed 0 96 165
on 0 96 165
him 0 96 165
by 0 96 165
Pope 0 96 165
Benedict, 0 96 165
transgressing 0 96 165
the 0 96 165
Pope’s 0 96 165
order, 0 96 165
also 0 96 165
allowed 0 96 165
him 0 96 165
to 0 96 165
reside 0 96 165
at 0 96 165
a 0 96 165
seminary 0 96 165
in 0 96 165
Washington 0 96 165
D.C. 0 96 165

In 0 96 166
doing 0 96 166
so, 0 96 166
he 1 96 166
put 1 96 166
other 1 96 166
seminarians 1 96 166
at 1 96 166
risk. 1 96 166

[emphasis 0 96 167
in 0 96 167
original] 0 96 167

What 0 96 168
really 0 96 168
concerns 0 96 168
Faggioli 0 96 168
and 0 96 168
those 0 96 168
who 0 96 168
think 0 96 168
like 0 96 168
him 0 96 168
is 0 96 168
not 0 96 168
Wuerl 0 96 168
and 0 96 168
his 0 96 168
“complex 0 96 168
situation,” 0 96 168
which 0 96 168
is 0 96 168
not 0 96 168
complex 0 96 168
at 0 96 168
all. 0 96 168

Rather, 0 96 169
what 0 96 169
he 0 96 169
views 0 96 169
with 0 96 169
alarm 0 96 169
as 0 96 169
an 0 96 169
“essential 0 96 169
element” 0 96 169
of 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
context 0 96 169
in 0 96 169
which 0 96 169
Wuerl 0 96 169
operates 0 96 169
is 0 96 169
that 0 96 169
“scandals 0 96 169
are 0 96 169
also 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
opportunity 0 96 169
for 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
neo-traditionalist 0 96 169
Catholicism 0 96 169
of 0 96 169
the 0 96 169
younger 0 96 169
generations 0 96 169
of 0 96 169
American 0 96 169
Catholics 0 96 169
to 0 96 169
attack 0 96 169
American 0 96 169
bishops 0 96 169
and 0 96 169
cardinals 0 96 169
close 0 96 169
to 0 96 169
Pope 0 96 169
Francis….” 0 96 169
Better 1 96 169
a 1 96 169
thousand 1 96 169
septuagenarian 1 96 169
Wuerls 1 96 169
in 1 96 169
their 1 96 169
lavish 1 96 169
sties 1 96 169
of 1 96 169
corruption, 1 96 169
financed 1 96 169
by 1 96 169
the 1 96 169
faithful, 1 96 169
than 1 96 169
a 1 96 169
single, 1 96 169
young 1 96 169
neo-traditionalist 1 96 169
prelate! 1 96 169

But 0 96 170
what 0 96 170
exactly 0 96 170
is 0 96 170
a 0 96 170
neo-traditionalist? 0 96 170

Quite 0 96 171
simply: 0 96 171
an 1 96 171
orthodox 1 96 171
Catholic 1 96 171
who 1 96 171
has 1 96 171
had 1 96 171
enough 1 96 171
of 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
homosexual-infested 1 96 171
regime 1 96 171
of 1 96 171
novelty 1 96 171
imposed 1 96 171
on 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
Church 1 96 171
by 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
old 1 96 171
men 1 96 171
of 1 96 171
the 1 96 171
Council, 1 96 171
Bergoglio 0 96 171
merely 0 96 171
being 0 96 171
the 0 96 171
latest, 0 96 171
the 0 96 171
highest 0 96 171
placed, 0 96 171
and 0 96 171
one 0 96 171
of 0 96 171
the 0 96 171
last. 0 96 171

As 1 96 172
Faggioli 1 96 172
puts 1 96 172
it: 1 96 172
“In 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
last 1 96 172
fifteen 1 96 172
years, 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
American 1 96 172
Catholic 1 96 172
Church 1 96 172
has 1 96 172
been 1 96 172
traversed 1 96 172
by 1 96 172
a 1 96 172
radicalization 1 96 172
of 1 96 172
religious 1 96 172
conservatism 1 96 172
in 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
neo-traditionalism 1 96 172
sense, 1 96 172
especially 1 96 172
in 1 96 172
the 1 96 172
younger 1 96 172
generations 1 96 172
of 1 96 172
priests 1 96 172
and 1 96 172
intellectuals. 1 96 172

They 1 96 173
interpret 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
current 1 96 173
abuse 1 96 173
crisis 1 96 173
as 1 96 173
fruit 1 96 173
of 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
mistakes 1 96 173
of 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
Council 1 96 173
itself 1 96 173
and 1 96 173
not 1 96 173
only 1 96 173
of 1 96 173
the 1 96 173
post-Council…” 1 96 173

Just 0 96 174
as 0 96 174
Faggioli 0 96 174
fears, 0 96 174
many 0 96 174
in 0 96 174
the 0 96 174
up-and-coming 0 96 174
generation 0 96 174
of 0 96 174
Catholic 0 96 174
clergy 0 96 174
and 0 96 174
laity 0 96 174
recognize 0 96 174
the 0 96 174
obvious: 0 96 174
that 0 96 174
the 0 96 174
conciliar 0 96 174
texts, 0 96 174
for 0 96 174
all 0 96 174
their 0 96 174
prolix 0 96 174
repetition 0 96 174
of 0 96 174
traditional 0 96 174
teaching, 0 96 174
opened 1 96 174
the 1 96 174
way 1 96 174
to 1 96 174
ecclesial 1 96 174
disaster. 1 96 174

Because 0 96 175
in 0 96 175
those 0 96 175
texts—above 0 96 175
all 0 96 175
Gaudium 0 96 175
et 0 96 175
Spes, 0 96 175
Dignitatis 0 96 175
Humanae, 0 96 175
Unitatis 0 96 175
Redintegratio, 0 96 175
Nostra 0 96 175
Aetate 0 96 175
and 0 96 175
Sacrosanctum 0 96 175
Concilium—the 0 96 175
Council 0 96 175
verbally 0 96 175
prostrated 0 96 175
itself 0 96 175
before 0 96 175
“the 0 96 175
modern 0 96 175
world” 0 96 175
and 0 96 175
the 0 96 175
practitioners 0 96 175
of 0 96 175
other 0 96 175
religions 0 96 175
while 0 96 175
authorizing 0 96 175
Bugnini 0 96 175
(Secretary 0 96 175
of 0 96 175
the 0 96 175
liturgical 0 96 175
Preparatory 0 96 175
Commission 0 96 175
that 0 96 175
drafted 0 96 175
what 0 96 175
would 0 96 175
become 0 96 175
Sacrosanctum 0 96 175
Concilium) 0 96 175
to 0 96 175
begin 0 96 175
demolition 1 96 175
of 1 96 175
the 1 96 175
sacred 1 96 175
liturgy 1 96 175
that 0 96 175
was 0 96 175
the 0 96 175
very 0 96 175
foundation 0 96 175
Catholic 0 96 175
of 0 96 175
orthodoxy 0 96 175
and 0 96 175
orthopraxis. 0 96 175

To 0 96 176
quote 0 96 176
Paul 0 96 176
VI, 0 96 176
then 0 96 176
in 1 96 176
the 1 96 176
depths 1 96 176
of 1 96 176
his 1 96 176
conciliar 1 96 176
delirium 1 96 176
at 0 96 176
the 0 96 176
Council’s 0 96 176
close: 0 96 176

But 0 96 177
one 0 96 177
must 0 96 177
realize 0 96 177
that 0 96 177
this 0 96 177
council, 0 96 177
which 0 96 177
exposed 0 96 177
itself 0 96 177
to 0 96 177
human 0 96 177
judgment, 0 96 177
insisted 0 96 177
very 0 96 177
much 0 96 177
more 0 96 177
upon 0 96 177
this 0 96 177
pleasant 0 96 177
side 0 96 177
of 0 96 177
man, 0 96 177
rather 0 96 177
than 0 96 177
on 0 96 177
his 0 96 177
unpleasant 0 96 177
one. 0 96 177

Its 0 96 178
attitude 0 96 178
was 0 96 178
very 0 96 178
much 0 96 178
and 0 96 178
deliberately 0 96 178
optimistic. 0 96 178

A 0 96 179
wave 1 96 179
of 1 96 179
affection 1 96 179
and 1 96 179
admiration 1 96 179
flowed 1 96 179
from 1 96 179
the 1 96 179
council 1 96 179
over 1 96 179
the 1 96 179
modern 1 96 179
world 1 96 179
of 1 96 179
humanity…. 1 96 179

Instead 0 96 180
of 0 96 180
depressing 0 96 180
diagnoses, 0 96 180
encouraging 0 96 180
remedies; 0 96 180
instead 0 96 180
of 0 96 180
direful 0 96 180
prognostics, 0 96 180
messages 0 96 180
of 0 96 180
trust 0 96 180
issued 0 96 180
from 0 96 180
the 0 96 180
council 0 96 180
to 0 96 180
the 0 96 180
present-day 0 96 180
world. 0 96 180

The 0 96 181
modern 0 96 181
world’s 0 96 181
values 0 96 181
were 0 96 181
not 0 96 181
only 0 96 181
respected 0 96 181
but 0 96 181
honored, 0 96 181
its 0 96 181
efforts 0 96 181
approved, 0 96 181
its 1 96 181
aspirations 1 96 181
purified 1 96 181
and 1 96 181
blessed. 1 96 181

[emphasis 0 96 182
added] 0 96 182

Thus 1 96 183
did 1 96 183
Paul 1 96 183
describe 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
conciliar 1 96 183
“opening 1 96 183
to 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
world” 1 96 183
through 1 96 183
which 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
world 1 96 183
promptly 1 96 183
invaded 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
Church, 1 96 183
including 1 96 183
large 1 96 183
numbers 1 96 183
of 1 96 183
homosexuals 1 96 183
who 1 96 183
should 1 96 183
never 1 96 183
have 1 96 183
been 1 96 183
admitted 1 96 183
to 1 96 183
the 1 96 183
seminary. 1 96 183

In 0 96 184
sum, 0 96 184
Faggioli 0 96 184
is 0 96 184
representative 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
thinking 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
requires 0 96 184
defense 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
homosexualized 0 96 184
clergy 0 96 184
if 0 96 184
only 0 96 184
for 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
reason 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
tradition-minded 0 96 184
Catholics 0 96 184
cannot 0 96 184
be 0 96 184
allowed 0 96 184
to 0 96 184
take 0 96 184
their 0 96 184
place: 0 96 184
“This 0 96 184
neo-traditionalist 0 96 184
Catholicism 0 96 184
believes 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
sexual 0 96 184
abuses 0 96 184
are 0 96 184
committed 0 96 184
only 0 96 184
by 0 96 184
homosexual 0 96 184
clergy… 0 96 184
and 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
crisis 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
abuse 0 96 184
can 0 96 184
be 0 96 184
resolved 0 96 184
by 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
kind 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
Catholic 0 96 184
Jacobinism 0 96 184
that 0 96 184
should 0 96 184
eliminate 0 96 184
all 0 96 184
bishops 0 96 184
and 0 96 184
priests 0 96 184
minimally 0 96 184
engaged 0 96 184
in 0 96 184
dialogue 0 96 184
with 0 96 184
modern 0 96 184
culture, 0 96 184
and 0 96 184
replaced 0 96 184
by 0 96 184
a 1 96 184
young 1 96 184
clergy 1 96 184
marked 1 96 184
by 1 96 184
personal 1 96 184
sanctity 1 96 184
but 1 96 184
also 1 96 184
by 1 96 184
a 1 96 184
fascination 1 96 184
for 1 96 184
a 1 96 184
mythical 1 96 184
Middle 1 96 184
Ages 1 96 184
and 0 96 184
the 0 96 184
rejection 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
Church-world 0 96 184
relationship 0 96 184
based 0 96 184
on 0 96 184
a 0 96 184
principle 0 96 184
of 0 96 184
reality.” 0 96 184

Rather 0 96 185
than 0 96 185
“young 1 96 185
clergy 1 96 185
marked 1 96 185
by 1 96 185
personal 1 96 185

the 0 96 185
neo-Catholic 0 96 185
mentality 0 96 185
Faggioli 0 96 185
exemplifies 0 96 185
prefers 0 96 185
that 0 96 185
homosexual 0 96 185
priests 0 96 185
and 0 96 185
bishops 0 96 185
be 0 96 185
kept 0 96 185
in 0 96 185
place 0 96 185
in 0 96 185
order 0 96 185
to 0 96 185
continue 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
“dialogue 0 96 185
with 0 96 185
modern 0 96 185
culture.” 0 96 185
It 0 96 185
is 0 96 185
not 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
integrity 0 96 185
of 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
Faith 0 96 185
that 0 96 185
matters 0 96 185
but 0 96 185
only 0 96 185
perpetuation 0 96 185
of 0 96 185
the 0 96 185
post-conciliar 0 96 185
regime 0 96 185
of 0 96 185
novelty. 0 96 185

Any 1 96 186
abandonment 1 96 186
of 1 96 186
the 1 96 186
regime 1 96 186
must 1 96 186
be 1 96 186
viewed 1 96 186
as 1 96 186
ecclesiastical 1 96 186
treason—“Catholic 1 96 186
Jacobinism”—if 1 96 186
not 1 96 186
criminal 1 96 186
activity. 1 96 186

Faggioli 0 96 187
would 0 96 187
probably 0 96 187
be 0 96 187
more 0 96 187
inclined 0 96 187
to 0 96 187
civil 0 96 187
or 0 96 187
criminal 0 96 187
prosecution 0 96 187
of 0 96 187
“Catholic 0 96 187
Jacobins” 0 96 187
for 0 96 187
“hate 0 96 187
speech” 0 96 187
than 0 96 187
Novus 0 96 187
Ordo 0 96 187
bishops 0 96 187
for 0 96 187
their 0 96 187
complicity 0 96 187
in 0 96 187
covering 0 96 187
up 0 96 187
homosexual 0 96 187
rapes. 0 96 187

“Homosexuality 1 96 188
in 1 96 188
the 1 96 188
clergy 1 96 188
exists 1 96 188
and 1 96 188
is 1 96 188
a 1 96 188
matter 1 96 188
that 1 96 188
must 1 96 188
be 1 96 188
addressed,” 1 96 188
Faggioli 0 96 188
fleetingly 0 96 188
acknowledges 0 96 188
toward 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
end 0 96 188
of 0 96 188
his 0 96 188
piece, 0 96 188
“but 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
abuse 0 96 188
crisis 0 96 188
cannot 0 96 188
be 0 96 188
resolved 0 96 188
by 0 96 188
making 0 96 188
homosexuals 0 96 188
within 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
Church 0 96 188
the 0 96 188
scapegoat 0 96 188
of 0 96 188
a 0 96 188
scandal 0 96 188
that 0 96 188
has 0 96 188
ancient 0 96 188
roots, 0 96 188
well 0 96 188
before 0 96 188
Vatican 0 96 188
Council 0 96 188
II.” 0 96 188
And 1 96 188
how 1 96 188
does 1 96 188
the 1 96 188
Church 1 96 188
“address” 1 96 188
a 1 96 188
massive 1 96 188
infestation 1 96 188
by 1 96 188
homosexual 1 96 188
priests 1 96 188
and 1 96 188
prelates 1 96 188
without 1 96 188
removing 1 96 188
them 1 96 188
from 1 96 188
authority 1 96 188
and 1 96 188
ensuring 1 96 188
that 1 96 188
they 1 96 188
cannot 1 96 188
promote 1 96 188
homosexual 1 96 188
successors 1 96 188
for 1 96 188
generation 1 96 188
after 1 96 188
generation? 1 96 188

Faggioli 0 96 189
has 0 96 189
no 0 96 189
answer 0 96 189
because 0 96 189
what 1 96 189
he 1 96 189
is 1 96 189
really 1 96 189
arguing—the 1 96 189
final 1 96 189
beachhead 1 96 189
of 1 96 189
the 1 96 189
neo-Catholic 1 96 189
defense 1 96 189
of 1 96 189
their 1 96 189
disintegrating 1 96 189
regime—is 1 96 189
that 1 96 189
homosexuals 1 96 189
in 1 96 189
the 1 96 189
hierarchy 1 96 189
must 1 96 189
remain 1 96 189
in 1 96 189
authority 1 96 189
as 1 96 189
an 1 96 189
indispensable 1 96 189
seawall 1 96 189
against 1 96 189
a 1 96 189
“neo-traditionalist” 1 96 189
storm 1 96 189
surge. 1 96 189

Faggioli’s 1 96 190
argument 1 96 190
demonstrates 1 96 190
that 1 96 190
neo-Catholicism 1 96 190
has 1 96 190
never 1 96 190
been 1 96 190
about 1 96 190
making 1 96 190
the 1 96 190
authentic 1 96 190
Faith 1 96 190
more 1 96 190
appealing 1 96 190
to 1 96 190
a 1 96 190
“modern 1 96 190
world” 1 96 190
founded 1 96 190
precisely 1 96 190
on 1 96 190
a 1 96 190
rejection 1 96 190
of 1 96 190
the 1 96 190
Church’s 1 96 190
authority. 1 96 190

It 1 96 191
is 1 96 191
not 1 96 191
about 1 96 191
the 1 96 191
Faith 1 96 191
at 1 96 191
all. 1 96 191

Rather, 1 96 192
it 1 96 192
is 1 96 192
an 1 96 192
ideological 1 96 192
movement 1 96 192
dedicated 1 96 192
to 1 96 192
the 1 96 192
face-saving 1 96 192
defense 1 96 192
of 1 96 192
a 1 96 192
catastrophic 1 96 192
failure 1 96 192
in 1 96 192
ecclesial 1 96 192
innovation 1 96 192
that 1 96 192
has 1 96 192
corrupted 1 96 192
the 1 96 192
human 1 96 192
element 1 96 192
of 1 96 192
the 1 96 192
Church 1 96 192
in 1 96 192
practically 1 96 192
every 1 96 192
department. 1 96 192

For 0 96 193
people 0 96 193
like 0 96 193
Faggioli, 0 96 193
indeed 0 96 193
for 0 96 193
the 1 96 193
tradition-hating 1 96 193
Pope 1 96 193
they 0 96 193
blindly 0 96 193
defend, 0 96 193
the 0 96 193
one 0 96 193
thing 0 96 193
to 0 96 193
be 0 96 193
feared 0 96 193
is 0 96 193
that 0 96 193
more 1 96 193
and 1 96 193
more 1 96 193
faithful 1 96 193
will 1 96 193
recognize 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
neo-Catholic 1 96 193
polemic 1 96 193
for 1 96 193
what 1 96 193
it 1 96 193
is—a 1 96 193
fraud—and 1 96 193
begin 1 96 193
demanding 1 96 193
a 1 96 193
return 1 96 193
of 1 96 193
everything 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
regime 1 96 193
of 1 96 193
novelty 1 96 193
has 1 96 193
stolen 1 96 193
from 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
life 1 96 193
of 1 96 193
the 1 96 193
Church. 1 96 193

That 1 96 194
is 1 96 194
exactly 1 96 194
what 1 96 194
a 1 96 194
growing 1 96 194
number 1 96 194
of 1 96 194
Catholics 1 96 194
are 1 96 194
now 1 96 194
doing, 1 96 194
as 1 96 194
even 1 96 194
the 1 96 194
secular 1 96 194
press 1 96 194
recognized 1 96 194
less 1 96 194
than 1 96 194
three 1 96 194
months 1 96 194
before 1 96 194
Bergoglio 1 96 194
began 1 96 194
his 1 96 194
tyrannical 1 96 194
reign. 1 96 194

In 0 96 195
this 0 96 195
respect, 0 96 195
what 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
neo-Catholics 0 96 195
are 0 96 195
defending 0 96 195
at 0 96 195
bottom 0 96 195
is 0 96 195
themselves—that 0 96 195
is, 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
reputations 0 96 195
they 0 96 195
have 0 96 195
all 0 96 195
staked 0 96 195
on 0 96 195
their 0 96 195
defense 0 96 195
of 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
indefensible 0 96 195
against 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
traditionalists 0 96 195
they 0 96 195
have 0 96 195
arrogantly 0 96 195
mocked 0 96 195
and 0 96 195
marginalized 0 96 195
for 0 96 195
decades 0 96 195
only 0 96 195
to 0 96 195
see, 0 96 195
to 1 96 195
their 1 96 195
horror, 1 96 195
that 0 96 195
traditionalism 0 96 195
is 0 96 195
ever 0 96 195
more 0 96 195
vindicated 0 96 195
as 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
scandals 0 96 195
of 0 96 195
the 0 96 195
Novus 0 96 195
Ordo 0 96 195
mount 1 96 195
under 1 96 195
this 1 96 195
reckless 1 96 195
Pope 1 96 195
to 1 96 195
an 1 96 195
unsustainable, 1 96 195
indeed 1 96 195
apocalyptic, 1 96 195
level. 1 96 195

A 0 96 196
return 0 96 196
to 0 96 196
integral 0 96 196
Tradition 0 96 196
is 0 96 196
the 0 96 196
threat 0 96 196
that 0 96 196
Faggioli 0 96 196
sees 0 96 196
as 0 96 196
coming 0 96 196
particularly 0 96 196
from 0 96 196
the 0 96 196
young. 0 96 196

Irony 1 96 197
of 1 96 197
ironies, 1 96 197
he 0 96 197
is 0 96 197
now 0 96 197
reduced 0 96 197
to 0 96 197
defending 0 96 197
what 0 96 197
is 0 96 197
old 0 96 197
and 0 96 197
tired 0 96 197
and 0 96 197
corrupt 0 96 197
against 0 96 197
a 0 96 197
restoration, 0 96 197
led 0 96 197
largely 0 96 197
by 0 96 197
a 1 96 197
youthful 1 96 197
vanguard, 1 96 197
of 1 96 197
what 1 96 197
is 1 96 197
ever 1 96 197
ancient 1 96 197
but 1 96 197
ever 1 96 197
new. 1 96 197

For 0 96 198
some, 0 96 198
it 0 96 198
seems, 0 96 198
no 0 96 198
price 0 96 198
is 0 96 198
too 0 96 198
great—not 0 96 198
even 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
good 0 96 198
of 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
Church—to 0 96 198
avoid 0 96 198
the 0 96 198
personal 0 96 198

As 0 96 204

Cardinal 0 96 205

In 0 96 206
November 0 96 206
2000, 0 96 206
Nunzio 0 96 206

serious 0 96 206
abuses 0 96 206
committed 0 96 206
by 0 96 206
McCarrick. 0 96 206

It 0 96 207
is 0 96 207
known 0 96 207
that 0 96 207
Sodano 0 96 207
tried 0 96 207
to 0 96 207

up 0 96 207

He 0 96 208
even 0 96 208
removed 0 96 208
the 0 96 208
Nuncio 0 96 208
in 0 96 208
Mexico 0 96 208
City, 0 96 208
Justo 0 96 208

was 0 96 208
willing 0 96 208
to 0 96 208
collaborate 0 96 208
in 0 96 208
the 0 96 208
cover-up. 0 96 208

Sodano 0 96 209
even 0 96 209
went 0 96 209
so 0 96 209
far 0 96 209
as 0 96 209
to 0 96 209
issue 0 96 209
a 0 96 209
statement 0 96 209
to 0 96 209
the 0 96 209
Vatican 0 96 209
press 0 96 209
office 0 96 209
in 0 96 209
which 0 96 209
a 0 96 209
falsehood 0 96 209
was 0 96 209
affirmed, 0 96 209
that 0 96 209
is, 0 96 209
that 0 96 209
Pope 0 96 209
Benedict 0 96 209
had 0 96 209
decided 0 96 209
that 0 96 209
the 0 96 209
Maciel 0 96 209
case 0 96 209
should 0 96 209
be 0 96 209
considered 0 96 209
closed. 0 96 209

Benedict 0 96 210
reacted, 0 96 210
despite 0 96 210
Sodano’s 0 96 210
strenuous 0 96 210
defense, 0 96 210
and 0 96 210
Maciel 0 96 210
was 0 96 210
found 0 96 210
guilty 0 96 210
and 0 96 210
irrevocably 1 96 210
condemned. 1 96 210

It 0 96 211
is 0 96 211
no 0 96 211

that, 0 96 211

also 0 96 211
taken 0 96 211
the 0 96 211
leading 0 96 211
role 0 96 211
in 0 96 211
suppressing 0 96 211
the 0 96 211

stripped 1 96 211
of 1 96 211
its 1 96 211
prophetic 1 96 211
and 1 96 211
admonitory 1 96 211
content 1 96 211
regarding 1 96 211

Inside 0 96 212
the 0 96 212

We 0 96 213
were 0 96 213
discussing 0 96 213
the 0 96 213
Third 0 96 213
Secret 0 96 213

the 0 96 213
Vatican 0 96 213

of 0 96 213

in 0 96 213
a 0 96 213
book 0 96 213
where 0 96 213
Bertone 0 96 213
states 0 96 213
that 0 96 213
there 0 96 213
is 0 96 213
nothing 0 96 213
more 0 96 213

Sambi 0 96 214
said, 0 96 214
“Excuse 0 96 214
me.” 0 96 214
He 0 96 214
got 0 96 214
up, 0 96 214
went 0 96 214
out 0 96 214
of 0 96 214
the 0 96 214
room, 0 96 214
and 0 96 214
came 0 96 214
back 0 96 214
with 0 96 214
a 0 96 214
book. 0 96 214

“Here,” 0 96 215
he 0 96 215
said. 0 96 215

“Do 0 96 216
you 0 96 216
know 0 96 216
this 0 96 216
book? 0 96 216

You 0 96 217
should 0 96 217
read 0 96 217
it.” 0 96 217
It 0 96 217
was 0 96 217
Christopher 0 96 217
Ferrara's 0 96 217
The 0 96 217
Secret 0 96 217
Still 0 96 217
Hidden. 0 96 217

“Wait,” 0 96 218
I 0 96 218
said. 0 96 218

“You 1 96 219
are 1 96 219

US, 1 96 219
and 1 96 219
you 1 96 219
are 1 96 219
urging 1 96 219
me 1 96 219
to 1 96 219
read 1 96 219
a 1 96 219
book 1 96 219
that 1 96 219
questions 1 96 219
what 1 96 219
the 1 96 219

Sambi 0 96 219
replied, 0 96 219
“All 0 96 219
I 0 96 219
am 0 96 219

And 0 96 220

which 0 96 224
we 0 96 224
can 0 96 224
find 0 96 224
in 0 96 224
this 0 96 224
message 0 96 224
today, 0 96 224
there 0 96 224
is 0 96 224
also 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
fact 0 96 224
that 0 96 224
attacks 0 96 224
on 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Pope 0 96 224
and 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Church 0 96 224
come 0 96 224
not 0 96 224
only 0 96 224
from 0 96 224
without, 0 96 224
but 0 96 224
the 1 96 224
sufferings 1 96 224
of 1 96 224
the 1 96 224
Church 1 96 224
come 0 96 224
precisely 0 96 224
from 0 96 224
within 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Church, 0 96 224
from 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
sin 0 96 224
existing 0 96 224
within 0 96 224
the 0 96 224
Church. 0 96 224

This 0 96 225
too 0 96 225
is 0 96 225
something 0 96 225
that 0 96 225
we 0 96 225
have 0 96 225
always 0 96 225
known, 0 96 225
but 0 96 225
today 0 96 225
we 0 96 225
are 0 96 225
seeing 0 96 225
it 0 96 225
in 0 96 225
a 1 96 225
really 1 96 225
terrifying 1 96 225
way: 1 96 225
that 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
greatest 0 96 225
persecution 0 96 225
of 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
Church 0 96 225
comes 0 96 225
not 0 96 225
from 0 96 225
her 0 96 225
enemies 0 96 225
without, 0 96 225
but 0 96 225
arises 0 96 225
from 0 96 225
sin 0 96 225
within 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
Church, 0 96 225
and 0 96 225
that 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
Church 0 96 225
thus 0 96 225
has 0 96 225
a 1 96 225
deep 1 96 225
need 1 96 225
to 1 96 225
relearn 1 96 225
penance, 1 96 225
to 1 96 225
accept 1 96 225
purification, 1 96 225
to 1 96 225
learn 1 96 225
forgiveness 1 96 225
on 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
one 0 96 225
hand, 0 96 225
but 0 96 225
also 0 96 225
the 0 96 225
need 0 96 225
for 0 96 225
justice. 0 96 225

[emphasis 0 96 226
added] 0 96 226

I 1 96 227
believe 1 96 227
that 1 96 227
Archbishop 1 96 227
Viganò’s 1 96 227
precious 1 96 227
testimony 1 96 227
is 1 96 227
a 1 96 227
sign 1 96 227
that 1 96 227
Heaven 1 96 227
itself 1 96 227
is 1 96 227
now 1 96 227
responding 1 96 227
to 1 96 227
the 1 96 227
“need 1 96 227
for 1 96 227
justice” 1 96 227
in 1 96 227
the 1 96 227
Church. 1 96 227

Whether 0 96 228
or 0 96 228
not 0 96 228
justice 0 96 228
involves 0 96 228
the 0 96 228
resignation 0 96 228
of 0 96 228
the 1 96 228
most 1 96 228
wayward 1 96 228
Pope 1 96 228
in 1 96 228
Church 1 96 228
history, 1 96 228
the 0 96 228
inevitable 0 96 228
season 0 96 228
of 0 96 228
justice 0 96 228
will 0 96 228
culminate 0 96 228
in 1 96 228
the 1 96 228
triumph 1 96 228
of 1 96 228
the 1 96 228
Immaculate 1 96 228
Heart 1 96 228
of 1 96 228
Mary 1 96 228
and 0 96 228
the 0 96 228
Church’s 0 96 228
restoration. 0 96 228

This 0 96 229
will 0 96 229
be 0 96 229
a 0 96 229
final 0 96 229
victory 0 96 229
over 0 96 229
the 0 96 229
enemies 0 96 229
within 0 96 229
and 0 96 229
their 0 96 229
apologists, 0 96 229
such 0 96 229
as 0 96 229
Faggioli, 0 96 229
who, 0 96 229
in 0 96 229
typical 0 96 229
neo-Catholic 0 96 229
style, 0 96 229
imperiously 1 96 229
scoffs 1 96 229
at 0 96 229
the 0 96 229
notion 0 96 229
of 0 96 229
“a 0 96 229
young 1 96 229
clergy 1 96 229
marked 1 96 229

personal 1 96 229
sanctity 1 96 229
but 1 96 229
also 1 96 229
by 1 96 229
a 1 96 229
fascination 1 96 229
for 1 96 229
a 1 96 229
mythical 1 96 229

and 0 96 229
busies 0 96 229
himself 0 96 229
defending 0 96 229
an 1 96 229
unsalvageable 1 96 229
mass 1 96 229
of 1 96 229
corruption 1 96 229
he 0 96 229
dares 0 96 229
to 0 96 229
describe 0 96 229
as 0 96 229
“a 0 96 229
Church-world 1 96 229
relationship 1 96 229
based 1 96 229
on 1 96 229
a 1 96 229
principle 1 96 229
of 1 96 229
reality.” 1 96 229

I 0 96 230
can 0 96 230
only 0 96 230
conclude 0 96 230
by 0 96 230
making 0 96 230
my 0 96 230

In 0 97 17
2013, 0 97 17
Wilson 0 97 17
had 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
information 0 97 17
on 0 97 17
how 0 97 17
to 0 97 17
build 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
gun 0 97 17
removed 0 97 17
from 0 97 17
public 0 97 17
access 0 97 17
at 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
request 0 97 17
of 0 97 17
the 0 97 17
United 0 97 17
States 0 97 17
Department 0 97 17
of 0 97 17
Defense 0 97 17
Trade 0 97 17
Controls. 0 97 17

According 0 97 18
to 0 97 18
Wilson, 0 97 18
they 0 97 18
seized 0 97 18
control 0 97 18
of 0 97 18
the 0 97 18
information. 0 97 18

Clearly, 1 97 19
they 1 97 19
were 1 97 19
acting 1 97 19
unlawfully 1 97 19
when 1 97 19
they 1 97 19
did 1 97 19
what 1 97 19
they 1 97 19
did. 1 97 19

"I 0 97 20
thought 1 97 20
my 1 97 20
life 1 97 20
was 1 97 20
over," 1 97 20
Wilson 0 97 20
said 0 97 20
after 0 97 20
his 0 97 20
attorneys 0 97 20
told 0 97 20
him 0 97 20
he 0 97 20
didn't 0 97 20
fair 0 97 20
well 0 97 20
going 0 97 20
up 0 97 20
against 0 97 20
the 0 97 20
government. 0 97 20

So, 0 97 21
what 0 97 21
did 0 97 21
he 0 97 21
do? 0 97 21

He 0 97 22
fired 0 97 22
them, 0 97 22
and 0 97 22
got 0 97 22
a 0 97 22
new 0 97 22
legal 0 97 22
team. 0 97 22

Wired 0 97 23
has 0 97 23
the 0 97 23
story. 0 97 23

Instead, 0 97 24
Wilson 0 97 24
has 0 97 24
spent 0 97 24
the 0 97 24
last 0 97 24
years 0 97 24
on 0 97 24
an 0 97 24
unlikely 0 97 24
project 0 97 24
for 0 97 24
an 1 97 24
anarchist: 1 97 24
Not 0 97 24
simply 0 97 24
defying 0 97 24
or 0 97 24
skirting 0 97 24
the 0 97 24
law 0 97 24
but 0 97 24
taking 0 97 24
it 0 97 24
to 0 97 24
court 0 97 24
and 0 97 24
changing 0 97 24
it. 0 97 24

In 0 97 25
doing 0 97 25
so, 0 97 25
he 0 97 25
has 0 97 25
now 0 97 25
not 0 97 25
only 0 97 25
defeated 0 97 25
a 0 97 25
legal 0 97 25
threat 0 97 25
to 0 97 25
his 0 97 25
own 0 97 25
highly 0 97 25
controversial 0 97 25
gunsmithing 0 97 25
project. 0 97 25

He 0 97 26
may 0 97 26
have 0 97 26
also 0 97 26
unlocked 0 97 26
a 0 97 26
new 0 97 26
era 0 97 26
of 0 97 26
digital 0 97 26
DIY 0 97 26
gunmaking 0 97 26
that 0 97 26
further 0 97 26
undermines 0 97 26
gun 0 97 26
control 0 97 26
across 0 97 26
the 0 97 26
United 0 97 26
States 0 97 26
and 0 97 26
the 0 97 26
world—another 0 97 26
step 0 97 26
toward 0 97 26
Wilson's 0 97 26
imagined 0 97 26
future 0 97 26
where 0 97 26
anyone 1 97 26
can 1 97 26
make 1 97 26
a 1 97 26
deadly 1 97 26
weapon 1 97 26
at 1 97 26
home 1 97 26
with 1 97 26
no 1 97 26
government 1 97 26
oversight. 1 97 26

Two 0 97 27

the 0 97 27
Department 0 97 27
of 0 97 27
Justice 0 97 27
quietly 0 97 27
offered 0 97 27
Wilson 0 97 27
a 0 97 27
settlement 0 97 27
to 0 97 27
end 0 97 27
a 0 97 27
lawsuit 0 97 27
he 0 97 27
and 0 97 27
a 0 97 27
group 0 97 27
of 0 97 27
co-plaintiffs 0 97 27
have 0 97 27

2015 0 97 27
against 0 97 27
the 0 97 27

Wilson 0 97 28
and 0 97 28
his 0 97 28
team 0 97 28
of 0 97 28
lawyers 0 97 28
focused 0 97 28
their 0 97 28
legal 0 97 28

on 0 97 28

in 0 97 47
1974, 0 97 47
The 0 97 47

What 0 97 48
does 0 97 48
all 0 97 48
this 0 97 48
mean? 0 97 48

Well, 0 97 49
it's 0 97 49
pretty 0 97 49
simple, 0 97 49
and 1 97 49
I 1 97 49
highly 1 97 49
recommend 1 97 49
the 1 97 49
Wired 1 97 49
article, 1 97 49
which 1 97 49
is 1 97 49
quite 1 97 49
lengthy 1 97 49
and 1 97 49
has 1 97 49
lots 1 97 49
of 1 97 49
information, 1 97 49
but 0 97 49
what 0 97 49
this 0 97 49
does 0 97 49
is 0 97 49
demonstrates 0 97 49
that 0 97 49
the 1 97 49
genie 1 97 49
is 1 97 49
out 1 97 49
of 1 97 49
the 1 97 49
bottle 1 97 49
and 0 97 49
there 0 97 49
is 0 97 49
just 0 97 49
no 0 97 49
way 0 97 49
for 0 97 49
gun 1 97 49
grabbing 1 97 49
Communists 1 97 49
the 0 97 49
world 0 97 49
over 0 97 49
to 0 97 49
be 0 97 49
able 0 97 49
to 0 97 49
truly 0 97 49
enforce 0 97 49
their 0 97 49
unlawful 0 97 49
acts 0 97 49
of 0 97 49
fun 1 97 49
gun 1 97 49
confiscation. 1 97 49

Why? 0 97 50

Because 0 97 51
now, 0 97 51
anyone 0 97 51
with 0 97 51
access 0 97 51
to 0 97 51
the 0 97 51
internet 0 97 51
and 0 97 51
a 0 97 51
3D 0 97 51
printer 0 97 51
can 0 97 51
print 0 97 51
their 0 97 51
very 0 97 51
own 0 97 51
gun 0 97 51
that 0 97 51
is 0 97 51
unregistered. 0 97 51

That's 0 97 52
right, 0 97 52
and 0 97 52
it's 0 97 52
perfectly 0 97 52
legal 0 97 52
to 0 97 52
do 0 97 52
so. 0 97 52

And 0 97 53
we 0 97 53
aren't 0 97 53
just 0 97 53
talking 0 97 53
a 0 97 53
rigid 0 97 53
looking 0 97 53
one-shot 0 97 53
handgun. 0 97 53

We're 0 97 54
talking 0 97 54
ARs, 0 97 54
1911s 0 97 54
and 0 97 54
a 0 97 54
host 0 97 54
of 0 97 54
other 0 97 54
guns. 0 97 54

This 0 97 55
actually 0 97 55
may 0 97 55
end 0 97 55
up 0 97 55
undermining 0 97 55

the 0 97 55

"I 0 97 57

told 0 97 57
The 0 97 57
Daily 0 97 57
Wire 0 97 57
in 0 97 57
a 0 97 57

"What 1 97 58
has 1 97 58

lately?" 1 97 58

I 0 97 59
don't 0 97 59
know 0 97 59
that 0 97 59
I 0 97 59
would 0 97 59
go 0 97 59
quite 0 97 59
that 0 97 59
far, 0 97 59
after 0 97 59
all, 0 97 59
the 0 97 59
settlement 0 97 59
does 0 97 59
state 0 97 59
that 0 97 59
"the 0 97 59
government 0 97 59
expressly 0 97 59
acknowledges 0 97 59
that 0 97 59

up 0 97 59

– 0 97 59
are 0 97 59
not 0 97 59

Therefore, 0 97 60
the 0 97 60
government 0 97 60
still 0 97 60
believes 0 97 60
it 0 97 60

it 0 97 60

not 0 97 60
have 0 97 60
authority 0 97 60
to 0 97 60
do. 0 97 60

"This 0 97 61
doesn’t 0 97 61

everyone’s 0 97 61

that 0 97 61
in 0 97 61

he 0 97 61
added. 0 97 61

"The 1 97 62

What 0 98 34
Ted 0 98 34
Cruz 0 98 34
is 0 98 34
doing 0 98 34
is 0 98 34
the 0 98 34
same 0 98 34
thing 0 98 34
the 0 98 34
police 0 98 34
and 0 98 34
their 0 98 34
apologists 0 98 34
are 0 98 34
doing. 0 98 34

They 0 98 35
are 0 98 35
treating 0 98 35
Guyger 0 98 35
differently 0 98 35
because 0 98 35
she 0 98 35
is 0 98 35
part 0 98 35
of 0 98 35
the 0 98 35
system. 0 98 35

In 0 98 36
Cruz’s 0 98 36
eyes, 0 98 36
Guyger 0 98 36
going 0 98 36
into 0 98 36
an 0 98 36
apartment 0 98 36
that 0 98 36
wasn’t 0 98 36
her’s 0 98 36
and 0 98 36
killing 0 98 36
an 0 98 36
innocent 1 98 36
man 0 98 36
was 0 98 36
simply 0 98 36
a 0 98 36
case 0 98 36
of 0 98 36
being 0 98 36
in 0 98 36
the 0 98 36
wrong 0 98 36
place 0 98 36
at 0 98 36
the 0 98 36
wrong 0 98 36
time—a 0 98 36
tragic 0 98 36
mistake 0 98 36
that 0 98 36
ruined 0 98 36
two 0 98 36
lives, 0 98 36
according 0 98 36
to 0 98 36
Cruz. 0 98 36

But 0 98 37
that 0 98 37
is 0 98 37
not 0 98 37
the 0 98 37
case 0 98 37
at 0 98 37
all. 0 98 37

Would 0 98 38
Ted 0 98 38
Cruz 0 98 38
and 0 98 38
police 0 98 38
officers 0 98 38
be 0 98 38
following 0 98 38
this 0 98 38
same 0 98 38
narrative 0 98 38
if 0 98 38
the 0 98 38
roles 0 98 38
were 0 98 38
reversed? 0 98 38

If 0 98 39
it 0 98 39
was 0 98 39
Botham 0 98 39
Jean, 0 98 39
a 1 98 39
black 1 98 39
man, 1 98 39
walking 0 98 39
into 0 98 39
the 0 98 39
apartment 0 98 39
of 0 98 39
Amber 0 98 39
Guyger, 0 98 39
a 0 98 39
white 1 98 39
female 1 98 39
cop, 1 98 39
and 0 98 39
killing 0 98 39
her—would 0 98 39
police 0 98 39
and 0 98 39
Ted 0 98 39
Cruz 0 98 39
simply 0 98 39
write 0 98 39
it 0 98 39
off 0 98 39
as 0 98 39
a 0 98 39
tragic 0 98 39
accident? 0 98 39

Of 0 98 40
course, 0 98 40
we 0 98 40
know 0 98 40
the 0 98 40
answer 0 98 40
to 0 98 40
that 0 98 40
question 0 98 40
and 0 98 40
it 0 98 40
is 0 98 40
a 0 98 40

NO. 0 98 40

To 0 98 41

before 0 98 41
it 0 98 41
begins, 0 98 41
this 0 98 41
is 0 98 41
not 0 98 41
some 0 98 41
case 0 98 41
of 0 98 41
Democrat 0 98 41

Republican 0 98 41
or 0 98 41
right 0 98 41

This 0 98 42
is 0 98 42
a 0 98 42
case 0 98 42
of 0 98 42
right 0 98 42
versus 0 98 42
wrong, 0 98 42
and 0 98 42
what 0 98 42
Amber 0 98 42
Guyger 0 98 42
did 0 98 42
to 0 98 42
Botham 0 98 42

was 0 98 42
wrong. 0 98 42

There 0 98 43

no 0 98 43
other 0 98 43

around 0 98 43
it, 0 98 43
“mistake” 0 98 43
or 0 98 43
not. 0 98 43

From 0 98 44
the 0 98 44
start 0 98 44
of 0 98 44
this 0 98 44
case, 0 98 44

set 0 98 44
out 0 98 44
to 0 98 44
protect 0 98 44
Guyger 0 98 44
because 0 98 44

of 0 98 44

It’s 0 98 47
been 0 98 47
a 0 98 47
smear 0 98 47
campaign 0 98 47
from 0 98 47

Amber 0 98 48

took 0 98 48
an 0 98 48
innocent 1 98 48
person’s 0 98 48
life, 0 98 48
and 0 98 48

Saviano 0 100 19
said 0 100 19
the 0 100 19
commission 0 100 19
is 0 100 19
“a 0 100 19
good 0 100 19
idea,” 0 100 19
and 0 100 19
added, 0 100 19
“I’m 0 100 19

that 0 100 19

a 0 100 19

“That’s 0 100 21
kind 0 100 21
of 0 100 21
my 0 100 21
attitude 0 100 21
now: 0 100 21
If 1 100 21
I 1 100 21
don’t 1 100 21

probably 0 100 27

the 0 100 27

a 0 101 4
not 0 101 4

recent 0 101 5

“When 0 101 6

up 0 101 6
against 0 101 6

“I 0 101 6

Obama 0 101 8

the 0 101 8

His 0 101 9
administration 0 101 9
remained 0 101 9
largely 0 101 9
silent 0 101 9
when 0 101 9
Iranians 0 101 9

to 0 101 9
the 0 101 9

Some 0 101 10
have 0 101 10
speculated 0 101 10
that 0 101 10
his 0 101 10
administration 0 101 10
missed 0 101 10
out 0 101 10

opportunity 0 101 10

America’s 0 101 24

is 0 101 24
only 0 101 24

On 0 101 25
the 0 101 25
contrary, 0 101 25
the 0 101 25

correctly 0 101 25

The 0 101 28
navy 0 101 28
termed 0 101 28
these 0 101 28
near 0 101 28
ritualistic, 1 101 28
belligerent 1 101 28
encounters, 1 101 28
“unsafe 0 101 28
and 0 101 28
unprofessional.” 0 101 28

Iranian 0 101 29
arrogance 0 101 29
and 0 101 29
impudence 0 101 29
reached 0 101 29
its 0 101 29
zenith 0 101 29
with 0 101 29
the 0 101 29
January 0 101 29

2016 0 101 29

their 0 101 29

near 0 101 29
Farsi 0 101 29
Island. 0 101 29

The 0 101 30
RCBs 0 101 30
and 0 101 30
crews 0 101 30
manning 0 101 30
them 0 101 30
were 0 101 30
returned 0 101 30
some 0 101 30
16 0 101 30
hours 0 101 30
later 0 101 30
but 0 101 30
not 0 101 30
before 0 101 30
the 0 101 30
Iranians 0 101 30
stole 0 101 30
two 0 101 30
satellite 0 101 30
phone 0 101 30
sim 0 101 30
cards, 0 101 30
likely 0 101 30
containing 0 101 30
classified 0 101 30
information, 0 101 30
as 0 101 30
well 0 101 30
as 0 101 30
thousands 0 101 30
of 0 101 30
pages 0 101 30
of 0 101 30
information 0 101 30

maps 0 101 30
used 0 101 30
by 0 101 30
the 0 101 30
sailors. 0 101 30

Ironically, 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
seizure 0 101 31
occurred 0 101 31
on 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
very 0 101 31
day 0 101 31
that 0 101 31
Obama 0 101 31
was 0 101 31
to 0 101 31
give 0 101 31
his 0 101 31
State 0 101 31
of 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
Union 0 101 31
address 0 101 31
but 0 101 31
predictably, 0 101 31
he 1 101 31
didn’t 1 101 31
think 1 101 31
that 1 101 31
the 1 101 31
seizure 1 101 31
of 1 101 31
Americans 1 101 31
was 1 101 31
important 1 101 31
enough 1 101 31
to 1 101 31
note. 1 101 31

But 0 101 32
according 0 101 32
to 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
Navy, 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
past 0 101 32
five 0 101 32
months 0 101 32
have 0 101 32
witnessed 0 101 32
markedly 0 101 32
less 0 101 32
belligerent 0 101 32
conduct 0 101 32
from 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
Iranians, 0 101 32
leaving 0 101 32
Navy 0 101 32
officials 0 101 32
baffled 0 101 32
by 0 101 32
the 0 101 32
sudden 0 101 32
positive 0 101 32
change 0 101 32
in 0 101 32
attitude. 0 101 32

In 0 101 33
fact, 0 101 33
Iran’s 0 101 33
attitude 0 101 33
adjustment 0 101 33
in 0 101 33
the 0 101 33
Arabian 0 101 33
Gulf 0 101 33
is 0 101 33
no 0 101 33
mystery 0 101 33
and 0 101 33
stems 0 101 33
from 0 101 33
the 0 101 33
Trump 0 101 33
administration’s 0 101 33
implementation 0 101 33
of 0 101 33
a 0 101 33
new 0 101 33
robust 0 101 33
foreign 0 101 33
policy 0 101 33
vis-à-vis 0 101 33
the 0 101 33
Islamic 0 101 33
Republic. 0 101 33

Soon 0 101 34
after 0 101 34
taking 0 101 34
office, 0 101 34
Trump 0 101 34
noted 0 101 34
that 0 101 34
“Iran 0 101 34
[was] 0 101 34
playing 0 101 34
with 0 101 34
fire” 0 101 34
and 0 101 34
added 0 101 34
that 0 101 34
he 0 101 34
wouldn’t 0 101 34
be 0 101 34
as 0 101 34
“kind” 0 101 34
to 0 101 34
the 0 101 34
mullahs 0 101 34
as 0 101 34
Obama 0 101 34
was. 0 101 34

This 0 101 35
wasn’t 0 101 35
empty 1 101 35
rhetoric. 1 101 35

It 0 101 36
was 0 101 36
backed 0 101 36
up 0 101 36
by 0 101 36
tangible 0 101 36
action. 0 101 36

Additional 0 101 37
sanctions 0 101 37
were 0 101 37
imposed 0 101 37
against 0 101 37
Iran 0 101 37
for 0 101 37
acting 0 101 37
in 0 101 37
defiance 0 101 37
of 0 101 37
UNSCR 0 101 37
2231. 0 101 37

Sanctions 0 101 38
were 0 101 38
also 0 101 38
imposed 0 101 38
against 0 101 38
the 0 101 38
IRGC 0 101 38
for 0 101 38
supporting 0 101 38
terrorism. 0 101 38

Trump’s 0 101 39
DOJ 0 101 39
revived 0 101 39
and 0 101 39
breathed 0 101 39
new 0 101 39
life 0 101 39
into 0 101 39
Project 0 101 39
Cassandra, 0 101 39
a 0 101 39
promising 0 101 39
anti-Hezbollah/IRGC 0 101 39
law 0 101 39
enforcement 0 101 39
initiative 0 101 39
shelved 0 101 39
by 0 101 39
Obama. 0 101 39

Most 0 101 40
importantly, 0 101 40
Trump 0 101 40
failed 0 101 40
to 0 101 40
certify 0 101 40
the 0 101 40
JCPOA 0 101 40
noting 0 101 40
material 0 101 40
Iranian 0 101 40
breaches, 0 101 40
and 0 101 40
has 0 101 40
threatened 0 101 40
to 0 101 40
abrogate 0 101 40
the 0 101 40

in 0 101 40
its 0 101 40
entirety 0 101 40
unless 0 101 40
modifications 0 101 40
are 0 101 40
implemented. 0 101 40

Those 0 101 41
modifications 0 101 41
would 0 101 41
include 0 101 41
an 0 101 41
end 0 101 41
to 0 101 41
absurd 0 101 41
sunset 0 101 41
clauses 0 101 41
in 0 101 41

the 0 104 21

the 0 104 21

themselves 0 104 21

to 0 104 25
“normalize 0 104 25

A 0 104 31
third 0 104 31
AJHS-JVP 0 104 31
event 0 104 31
featured 0 104 31
Efrat 0 104 31
Yerday, 0 104 31
an 1 104 31
anti-Israel 1 104 31
activist, 0 104 31
accusing 0 104 31
Israel 0 104 31
of 0 104 31
racism. 0 104 31

Efrat 0 104 32
has 0 104 32
claimed 0 104 32
that, 0 104 32
"Zionism 1 104 32
does 1 104 32
not 1 104 32
only 1 104 32
dispossess 1 104 32
Palestinians, 1 104 32
but 1 104 32
it 1 104 32
also 1 104 32
dispossesses 1 104 32
in 1 104 32
a 1 104 32
very 1 104 32
sophisticated 1 104 32
way, 1 104 32
non-white 1 104 32
Jews. 1 104 32

Being 1 104 33
Jewish 1 104 33
is 1 104 33
highly 1 104 33
identified 1 104 33
with 1 104 33
being 1 104 33
white 1 104 33
because 1 104 33
of 1 104 33
Zionism." 1 104 33

AJHS 0 104 34
will 0 104 34
claim 0 104 34
that 0 104 34
it 0 104 34
is 0 104 34
only 0 104 34
offering 0 104 34
different 0 104 34
perspectives. 0 104 34

But 0 104 35
when 0 104 35
it 0 104 35
comes 0 104 35
to 0 104 35
Israel, 0 104 35
there’s 0 104 35
only 0 104 35
one 0 104 35
perspective. 0 104 35

“Balfour” 0 104 36
and 0 104 36
“Rubble 0 104 36
Rubble” 0 104 36
are 0 104 36
to 0 104 36
be 0 104 36

of 0 104 36
AJHS’ 0 104 36
“1917: 0 104 36

The 0 104 37

to 0 104 37

the 0 104 38
only 0 104 38

program 0 104 38
on 0 104 38
the 0 104 38
list 0 104 38
questions 0 104 38
whether 0 104 38
Israel 0 104 38
should 0 104 38
even 0 104 38
exist. 0 104 38

The 0 104 39
exhibition 0 104 39
closes 0 104 39
with 0 104 39
Fishback’s 0 104 39
anti-Israel 0 104 39
agenda. 0 104 39

And 0 104 40
these 0 104 40
are 0 104 40
the 0 104 40
only 0 104 40
listed 0 104 40
AJHS 0 104 40
programs 0 104 40
that 0 104 40
focus 0 104 40
on 0 104 40
Israel. 0 104 40

JVP 0 104 41
is 0 104 41
also 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
only 0 104 41
organization 0 104 41
that 0 104 41
AJHS 0 104 41

in 0 104 43

with 0 104 43

it’s 0 104 44

When 0 104 52
we 0 104 52
look 0 104 52
at 0 104 52
what 0 104 52
is 0 104 52
going 0 104 52
on 0 104 52
in 0 104 52
CJH’s 0 104 52
components 0 104 52
like 0 104 52
the 0 104 52
AJHS, 0 104 52
the 0 104 52
elevation 0 104 52
of 0 104 52
David 0 104 52
N. 0 104 52
Myers 0 104 52
to 0 104 52
head 0 104 52
CJH 0 104 52
is 0 104 52
unsurprising. 0 104 52

Myers 0 104 53
is 0 104 53
a 0 104 53
symptom 0 104 53
of 0 104 53
the 0 104 53
problem. 0 104 53

As 0 104 54
is 0 104 54
AJHS’s 0 104 54
partnership 0 104 54
with 0 104 54
JVP. 0 104 54

A 0 104 55
great 0 104 55
deal 0 104 55
of 0 104 55
shocking 0 104 55
behavior 0 104 55
is 0 104 55
taking 0 104 55
place 0 104 55
inside 0 104 55
Jewish 0 104 55
organizations 0 104 55
whose 0 104 55
inner 0 104 55
workings 0 104 55
most 0 104 55
people 0 104 55
in 0 104 55
the 0 104 55
Jewish 0 104 55
community 0 104 55
generally 0 104 55
pay 0 104 55
very 0 104 55
little 0 104 55
attention 0 104 55
to. 0 104 55

Unlike 0 104 56
CJH, 0 104 56
the 0 104 56
American 0 104 56
Jewish 0 104 56
Historical 0 104 56
Society 0 104 56
is 0 104 56
an 0 104 56
organization 0 104 56
that 0 104 56
dates 0 104 56
back 0 104 56
to 0 104 56
the 0 104 56
19th 0 104 56
century. 0 104 56

Its 1 104 57
perversion 1 104 57
by 0 104 57
the 0 104 57
radical 0 104 57
anti-Jewish 0 104 57
and 0 104 57
anti-Israel 0 104 57
left 0 104 57
to 0 104 57
serve 0 104 57
anti-Semitic 0 104 57
narratives 0 104 57
is 0 104 57
tragic. 0 104 57

And 0 104 58
yet 0 104 58
it’s 0 104 58
inescapable. 0 104 58

Even 0 104 59
as 0 104 59
the 0 104 59
Myers 0 104 59
scandal 0 104 59
continues 0 104 59
to 0 104 59
simmer, 1 104 59
the 0 104 59
AJHS 0 104 59
partnership 0 104 59
with 0 104 59
JVP 0 104 59
is 0 104 59
making 0 104 59
the 0 104 59
choice 0 104 59
painfully 0 104 59
clear. 0 104 59

The 0 104 60
radical 0 104 60
anti-Israel 0 104 60
left 0 104 60
will 0 104 60
not 0 104 60
be 0 104 60
satisfied 0 104 60
with 0 104 60
embedding 0 104 60
“moderate” 0 104 60
opposing 0 104 60
voices 0 104 60
into 0 104 60
Jewish 0 104 60
organizations. 0 104 60

Instead 0 104 61
it 0 104 61
seeks 0 104 61
to 0 104 61
normalize 0 104 61
the 0 104 61
furthest 0 104 61
extremes 0 104 61
of 0 104 61
anti-Israel 0 104 61
hatred. 0 104 61

And 0 104 62
it 0 104 62
will 0 104 62
not 0 104 62
be 0 104 62
satisfied 0 104 62
with 0 104 62
anything 0 104 62
less. 0 104 62

During 0 104 63
the 0 104 63
Myers 0 104 63
controversy, 0 104 63
defenders 0 104 63
of 0 104 63

claimed 0 104 63
that 0 104 63
it 0 104 63
was 0 104 63
an 0 104 63

Is 0 104 64

The 0 104 65
anti-Israel 0 104 65
leftists 0 104 65
at 0 104 65
the 0 104 65
AJHS 0 104 65
are 0 104 65
clearly 0 104 65
not 0 104 65
leaving 0 104 65
their 0 104 65
politics 0 104 65
at 0 104 65
home. 0 104 65

And 0 104 66
support 0 104 66
for 0 104 66
them 0 104 66
and 0 104 66
for 0 104 66

distinguished 0 104 66
from 0 104 66

Not 0 104 67
when 0 104 67
JVP 0 104 67
is 0 104 67
at 0 104 67
AJHS. 0 104 67

We 1 104 68
all 1 104 68
have 1 104 68
choices 1 104 68
to 1 104 68
make. 1 104 68

Sometimes 0 104 69
the 0 104 69
choices 0 104 69
are 0 104 69
murky. 0 104 69

Other 0 104 70
times 0 104 70
they 0 104 70
are 0 104 70
simple 0 104 70
and 0 104 70
easy. 0 104 70

When 0 104 71
the 0 104 71
American 0 104 71
Jewish 0 104 71
Historical 0 104 71
Society 0 104 71
hosts 0 104 71
and 0 104 71
co-sponsors 0 104 71
an 0 104 71
event 0 104 71
by 0 104 71
a 0 104 71
BDS 0 104 71
hate 0 104 71
group 0 104 71
attacking 0 104 71
the 0 104 71
existence 0 104 71
of 0 104 71
Israel 0 104 71
and 0 104 71
featuring 0 104 71
a 0 104 71
speaker 0 104 71
who 0 104 71
had 0 104 71
defended 0 104 71
terrorism 0 104 71
and 0 104 71
anti-Semitism, 0 104 71
the 0 104 71
choice 0 104 71
becomes 0 104 71
easy. 0 104 71

Either 1 104 72
you 1 104 72
stand 1 104 72
with 1 104 72
BDS, 1 104 72
Hamas, 1 104 72
blood 1 104 72
libels 1 104 72
and 1 104 72
those 1 104 72
who 1 104 72
want 1 104 72
to 1 104 72
destroy 1 104 72
Israel 1 104 72
or 1 104 72
with 1 104 72
Jews. 1 104 72

As 0 104 73
the 0 104 73
anti-Israel 0 104 73
radicalism 0 104 73
of 0 104 73
the 0 104 73
left 0 104 73
grows, 0 104 73
such 0 104 73
choices 0 104 73
will 0 104 73
become 0 104 73
even 0 104 73
more 0 104 73
obscenely 0 104 73
simple. 0 104 73

But 0 104 74
they 0 104 74
will 0 104 74
not 0 104 74
be 0 104 74
any 0 104 74
less 0 104 74
difficult. 0 104 74

Opposing 0 104 75
the 0 104 75
anti-Israel 0 104 75
left 0 104 75
makes 0 104 75
many 0 104 75
important 0 104 75
enemies 0 104 75
and 0 104 75
wins 0 104 75
few 0 104 75
friends. 0 104 75

The 0 104 76
anti-Israel 0 104 76
left 0 104 76
has 0 104 76
built 0 104 76
networks 0 104 76
that 0 104 76
can 0 104 76
blacklist, 0 104 76
smear 0 104 76
and 0 104 76
silence 0 104 76
almost 0 104 76
anyone 0 104 76
in 0 104 76
an 0 104 76
academic 0 104 76
field. 0 104 76

Speaking 0 104 77
out 0 104 77
against 0 104 77
hate 0 104 77
is 0 104 77
easiest 0 104 77
when 0 104 77
it’s 0 104 77
weakest. 0 104 77

It’s 0 104 78
hardest 0 104 78
when 0 104 78
it’s 0 104 78
strongest. 0 104 78

When 0 104 79
we 0 104 79
think 0 104 79
about 0 104 79
Nazi 0 104 79
Germany, 0 104 79
we 0 104 79
remember 0 104 79
those 0 104 79
who 0 104 79
spoke 0 104 79
out. 0 104 79

We 0 104 80
don’t 0 104 80
remember 0 104 80
those 0 104 80
who 0 104 80
were 0 104 80
too 0 104 80
intimidated 0 104 80
and 0 104 80
uncertain 0 104 80
to 0 104 80
rise 0 104 80
against 0 104 80
anti-Semitism 0 104 80
when 0 104 80
they 0 104 80
saw 0 104 80
it 0 104 80
and 0 104 80
heard 0 104 80
it. 0 104 80

History 0 104 81
tells 0 104 81
us 0 104 81
why 0 104 81
so 0 104 81
many 0 104 81
people 0 104 81
are 0 104 81
afraid 0 104 81
to 0 104 81
do 0 104 81
the 0 104 81
right 0 104 81
thing 0 104 81
when 0 104 81
it 0 104 81
counts. 0 104 81

It 0 104 82
also 0 104 82
tells 0 104 82
us 0 104 82
how 0 104 82
irrelevant 0 104 82
history 0 104 82
makes 0 104 82
them. 0 104 82

three 0 106 6
months 0 106 6

the 0 106 6

of 0 106 6
Vatican 0 106 6

just 0 106 6

an 0 106 6
important 0 106 6

of 0 106 6
a 0 106 6
critical 0 106 6
turning 0 106 6

in 0 106 6
Catholic 0 106 6

perhaps 0 106 6
the 0 106 6
most 0 106 6
important 0 106 6
of 0 106 6
modern 0 106 6
times. 0 106 6

Who 1 106 7
can 1 106 7
read 1 106 7
this 1 106 7
without 1 106 7
cringing 1 106 7
at 1 106 7
what 1 106 7
we 1 106 7
now 1 106 7
know 1 106 7
was 1 106 7
about 1 106 7
to 1 106 7
happen: 1 106 7

Therefore, 0 106 8
we 0 106 8
earnestly 0 106 8
hope 0 106 8
that 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
restored 0 106 8
sacred 0 106 8

will 0 106 8
bring 0 106 8
forth 0 106 8
abundant 0 106 8
fruits 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
eucharistic 0 106 8
devotion, 0 106 8
so 0 106 8
that 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
Holy 0 106 8
Church, 0 106 8
under 0 106 8
this 0 106 8
saving 0 106 8
sign 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
piety, 0 106 8
may 0 106 8
make 0 106 8
daily 0 106 8
progress 0 106 8
toward 0 106 8
perfect 0 106 8
unity 0 106 8
and 0 106 8
may 0 106 8
invite 0 106 8
all 0 106 8
Christians 0 106 8
to 0 106 8
a 0 106 8
unity 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
faith 0 106 8
and 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
love, 0 106 8
drawing 0 106 8
them 0 106 8
gently, 0 106 8
thanks 0 106 8
to 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
action 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
divine 0 106 8
grace. 0 106 8

But 0 106 9
in 0 106 9
1983 0 106 9
at 0 106 9
the 0 106 9
start 0 106 9
of 0 106 9
my 0 106 9
personal 0 106 9
investigations 0 106 9
into 0 106 9
the 0 106 9
Catholic 0 106 9
religion, 0 106 9
I 0 106 9
knew 0 106 9
nothing 0 106 9
of 0 106 9
any 0 106 9
of 0 106 9
that. 0 106 9

The 0 106 10
encyclical, 0 106 10
the 0 106 10
very 0 106 10
first 0 106 10
I 0 106 10
ever 0 106 10
read, 0 106 10
was 0 106 10
also 0 106 10
a 0 106 10
marker 0 106 10
for 0 106 10
me 0 106 10
of 0 106 10
a 0 106 10
personal 0 106 10
turning 0 106 10
point. 0 106 10

It 0 106 11
was 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
first 0 106 11
time 0 106 11
I 0 106 11
had 0 106 11
ever 0 106 11
seen 0 106 11
Catholic 0 106 11
eucharistic 0 106 11
doctrine 0 106 11
clearly 0 106 11
and 0 106 11
– 0 106 11
most 0 106 11
importantly 0 106 11
– 0 106 11
unapologetically 0 106 11
stated. 0 106 11

It 0 106 12
came 0 106 12
right 0 106 12
out 0 106 12
and 0 106 12
said 0 106 12
something 0 106 12
so 0 106 12
astounding, 0 106 12
something 0 106 12
so 0 106 12
completely 0 106 12
unlikely, 0 106 12
that 0 106 12
I 0 106 12
had 0 106 12
to 0 106 12
admit 0 106 12
that 0 106 12
it 0 106 12
left 0 106 12
very 0 106 12
few 0 106 12
logical 0 106 12
possibilities. 0 106 12

Like 0 106 13
C.S. 0 106 13

Lewis’s 0 106 14
assessment 0 106 14
of 0 106 14
the 0 106 14
claims 0 106 14
by 0 106 14
Christ 0 106 14
of 0 106 14
His 0 106 14
own 0 106 14
divinity, 0 106 14
this 0 106 14
pope 0 106 14
was 0 106 14
either 0 106 14
mad, 0 106 14
bad 0 106 14
or 0 106 14
telling 0 106 14
the 0 106 14
plain 0 106 14
truth. 0 106 14

Something 0 106 15
that 0 106 15
may 0 106 15
be 0 106 15
much 0 106 15
more 0 106 15
noteworthy 0 106 15
now 0 106 15
in 0 106 15
our 0 106 15
current 0 106 15
circumstances 0 106 15
than 0 106 15
it 0 106 15
was 0 106 15
the 0 106 15
year 0 106 15
I 0 106 15
read 0 106 15
it, 0 106 15
is 0 106 15
that 0 106 15
the 0 106 15
pope’s 0 106 15
very 0 106 15
first 0 106 15
quote 0 106 15
was 0 106 15
not 0 106 15
of 0 106 15
scripture, 0 106 15
but 0 106 15
the 0 106 15
Council 0 106 15
of 0 106 15
Trent: 0 106 15

“At 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
Last 0 106 16
Supper, 0 106 16
on 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
night 0 106 16
He 0 106 16
was 0 106 16
handed 0 106 16
over, 0 106 16
Our 0 106 16
Lord 0 106 16
instituted 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
Eucharistic 0 106 16
Sacrifice 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
His 0 106 16
Body 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
Blood, 0 106 16
to 0 106 16
perpetuate 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
sacrifice 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
cross 0 106 16
throughout 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
ages 0 106 16
until 0 106 16
He 0 106 16
should 0 106 16
come, 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
thus 0 106 16
entrust 0 106 16
to 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
Church, 0 106 16
His 0 106 16
beloved 0 106 16
spouse, 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
memorial 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
His 0 106 16
death 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
resurrection: 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
sacrament 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
devotion, 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
sign 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
unity, 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
bond 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
charity, 0 106 16
a 0 106 16
paschal 0 106 16
banquet 0 106 16
in 0 106 16
which 0 106 16
Christ 0 106 16
is 0 106 16
received, 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
soul 0 106 16
is 0 106 16
filled 0 106 16
with 0 106 16
grace 0 106 16
and 0 106 16
there 0 106 16
is 0 106 16
given 0 106 16
to 0 106 16
us 0 106 16
the 0 106 16
pledge 0 106 16
of 0 106 16
future 0 106 16
glory.” 0 106 16

In 0 106 17
these 0 106 17
words 0 106 17
are 0 106 17
highlighted 0 106 17
both 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
sacrifice, 0 106 17
which 0 106 17
pertains 0 106 17
to 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
essence 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
Mass 0 106 17
which 0 106 17
is 0 106 17
celebrated 0 106 17
daily, 0 106 17
and 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
sacrament 0 106 17
in 0 106 17
which 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
faithful 0 106 17
participate 0 106 17
in 0 106 17
Holy 0 106 17
Communion 0 106 17
by 0 106 17
eating 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
Flesh 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
Christ 0 106 17
and 0 106 17
drinking 0 106 17
His 0 106 17
Blood, 0 106 17
receiving 0 106 17
both 0 106 17
grace, 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
beginning 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
eternal 0 106 17
life, 0 106 17
and 0 106 17
the 0 106 17
medicine 0 106 17
of 0 106 17
immortality. 0 106 17

I 0 106 18
remember 0 106 18
my 0 106 18
thoughts 0 106 18
upon 0 106 18
reading 0 106 18
this 0 106 18
shocking 0 106 18
statement… 0 106 18
“By 0 106 18
doing 0 106 18
what? 0 106 18

!” 0 106 19

My 0 106 20
acceptance 0 106 20
from 0 106 20
the 0 106 20
reading 0 106 20
of 0 106 20
this 0 106 20
document 0 106 20
of 0 106 20
the 0 106 20
Church’s 0 106 20
orthodox 0 106 20
eucharistic 0 106 20
doctrine 0 106 20
was 0 106 20
based 0 106 20
in 0 106 20
part 0 106 20
on 0 106 20
Pope 1 106 20
Paul’s 1 106 20
gracious 1 106 20
and 1 106 20
beautiful 1 106 20
exposition, 1 106 20
and 1 106 20
in 1 106 20
part 1 106 20
on 1 106 20
the 1 106 20
sheer 1 106 20
radical, 1 106 20
mad 1 106 20
unlikeliness 1 106 20
of 1 106 20
it. 1 106 20

What 0 106 21
could 0 106 21
conceivably 0 106 21
be 0 106 21
the 0 106 21
reason 0 106 21
to 0 106 21
say 0 106 21
anything 0 106 21
as 0 106 21
wild 0 106 21
as 0 106 21
this 0 106 21
if 0 106 21
it 0 106 21
weren’t 0 106 21
true? 0 106 21

The 1 106 22
idea 1 106 22
of 1 106 22
transubstantiation 1 106 22
struck 1 106 22
me 1 106 22
as 1 106 22
I 1 106 22
read 1 106 22
that 1 106 22
document 1 106 22
as 1 106 22
possibly 1 106 22
the 1 106 22
strangest 1 106 22
and 1 106 22
most 1 106 22
earth 1 106 22
shattering 1 106 22
thing 1 106 22
I’d 1 106 22
ever 1 106 22
heard. 1 106 22

It 1 106 23
shocked 1 106 23
me 1 106 23
out 1 106 23
of 1 106 23
a 1 106 23
kind 1 106 23
of 1 106 23
swamp 1 106 23
of 1 106 23
intellectual 1 106 23
worldliness; 1 106 23
presenting 1 106 23
the 1 106 23
idea 1 106 23
to 1 106 23
my 1 106 23
thirsty 1 106 23
mind 1 106 23
that 1 106 23
there 1 106 23
could 1 106 23
indeed 1 106 23
be 1 106 23
fantastic 1 106 23
realities 1 106 23
far 1 106 23
more 1 106 23
wonderful 1 106 23
than 1 106 23
the 1 106 23
banal 1 106 23
and 1 106 23
painfully 1 106 23
uninteresting 1 106 23
secularist 1 106 23
worldview 1 106 23
I 1 106 23
had 1 106 23
been 1 106 23
taught 1 106 23
to 1 106 23
accept. 1 106 23

It 1 106 24
was 1 106 24
as 1 106 24
though 1 106 24
someone 1 106 24
had 1 106 24
plausibly 1 106 24
told 1 106 24
me 1 106 24
that, 1 106 24
yes, 1 106 24
there 1 106 24
were 1 106 24
fairies 1 106 24
and 1 106 24
magical 1 106 24
kingdoms 1 106 24
in 1 106 24
real 1 106 24
life, 1 106 24
“just 1 106 24
around 1 106 24
the 1 106 24
corner”. 1 106 24

By 0 106 25
the 0 106 25
time 0 106 25
I 0 106 25
read 0 106 25
it, 0 106 25
I 0 106 25
had 0 106 25
been 0 106 25
through 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
long, 0 106 25
slow 0 106 25
transition 0 106 25
from 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
childhood 0 106 25
devoted 0 106 25
to 0 106 25
Our 0 106 25
Lady 0 106 25
and 0 106 25
confirmed 0 106 25
in 0 106 25
my 0 106 25
belief 0 106 25
in 0 106 25
wonders, 0 106 25
to 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
kind 0 106 25
of 0 106 25
disappointed 0 106 25
practical 0 106 25
atheism 0 106 25
after 0 106 25
three 0 106 25
years 0 106 25
in 0 106 25
a 0 106 25
diocesan 0 106 25
Catholic 0 106 25
parochial 0 106 25
school. 0 106 25

I 0 106 26
had 0 106 26
been 0 106 26
taught, 0 106 26
by 0 106 26
both 0 106 26
word 0 106 26
and 0 106 26
implication, 0 106 26
that 0 106 26
everything 0 106 26
the 0 106 26
Catholic 0 106 26
Church 0 106 26
had 0 106 26
taught 0 106 26
before 0 106 26
Vatican 0 106 26
II 0 106 26
was 0 106 26
pernicious 1 106 26
nonsense. 1 106 26

Where 0 106 27
it 0 106 27
was 0 106 27
simply 0 106 27
wrong 0 106 27
it 0 106 27
was 0 106 27
ridiculous 0 106 27
and 0 106 27
where 0 106 27
it 0 106 27
was 0 106 27
wrong 0 106 27
and 0 106 27
political 0 106 27
it 1 106 27
was 1 106 27
outright 1 106 27
wicked. 1 106 27

What 0 106 28
led 0 106 28
me 0 106 28
to 0 106 28
read 0 106 28
that 0 106 28
particular 0 106 28
encyclical 0 106 28
is 0 106 28
the 0 106 28
most 0 106 28
clearly 0 106 28
identifiable 0 106 28
moment 0 106 28
of 0 106 28
actual 0 106 28
grace 0 106 28
in 0 106 28
my 0 106 28
young 0 106 28
life 0 106 28
to 0 106 28
that 0 106 28
point. 0 106 28

It 0 106 29
was 0 106 29
the 0 106 29
first 0 106 29
time 0 106 29
it 0 106 29
occurred 0 106 29
to 0 106 29
me 0 106 29
to 0 106 29
investigate, 0 106 29
like 0 106 29
an 0 106 29
anthropologist, 0 106 29
what 0 106 29
the 0 106 29
Church 0 106 29
herself 0 106 29
said 0 106 29
about 0 106 29
her 0 106 29
teachings. 0 106 29

While 0 106 30
mulling 0 106 30
grimly 0 106 30
one 0 106 30
day 0 106 30
over 0 106 30
all 0 106 30
the 0 106 30
wickedness 0 106 30
of 0 106 30
the 0 106 30
Catholic 0 106 30
Church, 0 106 30
I 0 106 30
was 0 106 30
pulled 0 106 30
up 0 106 30
short 0 106 30
by 0 106 30
a 0 106 30
single 0 106 30
thought: 0 106 30
“I 0 106 30
could 0 106 30
be 0 106 30
wrong.” 0 106 30
At 0 106 30
17 0 106 30
it 0 106 30
seemed 0 106 30
such 0 106 30
an 0 106 30
unlikely 0 106 30
thing 0 106 30
to 0 106 30
think 0 106 30
I 0 106 30
was 0 106 30
rather 0 106 30
shocked. 0 106 30

But 0 106 31
stopping 0 106 31
a 0 106 31
moment 0 106 31
to 0 106 31
consider, 0 106 31
I 0 106 31
realised 0 106 31
that 0 106 31
I 0 106 31
had 0 106 31
only 0 106 31
ever 0 106 31
heard 0 106 31
about 0 106 31
Catholic 0 106 31
things 0 106 31
from 0 106 31
people 0 106 31
who 0 106 31
clearly 0 106 31
hated 0 106 31
the 0 106 31
Church; 0 106 31
her 0 106 31
enemies, 0 106 31
in 0 106 31
short. 0 106 31

It 0 106 32
hardly 0 106 32
seemed 0 106 32
just 0 106 32
to 0 106 32
convict 0 106 32
on 0 106 32
the 0 106 32
testimony 0 106 32
of 0 106 32
these 0 106 32
obviously 0 106 32
biased 0 106 32
witnesses. 0 106 32

In 0 106 33
order 0 106 33
to 0 106 33
properly 0 106 33
and 0 106 33
thoroughly 0 106 33
condemn 0 106 33
the 0 106 33
Church, 0 106 33
with 0 106 33
convincing 0 106 33
due 0 106 33
diligence, 0 106 33
I 0 106 33
had 0 106 33
to 0 106 33
read 0 106 33
something 0 106 33
about 0 106 33
it 0 106 33
that 0 106 33
didn’t 0 106 33
come 0 106 33
from 0 106 33
her 0 106 33
enemies. 0 106 33

The 0 106 34
same 0 106 34
day, 0 106 34
I 0 106 34
presented 0 106 34
myself 0 106 34
at 0 106 34
the 0 106 34
reference 0 106 34
desk 0 106 34
of 0 106 34
the 0 106 34
public 0 106 34
library 0 106 34
and 0 106 34
asked, 0 106 34
“Do 0 106 34
you 0 106 34
have 0 106 34
any 0 106 34
books 0 106 34
about 0 106 34
Catholicism? 0 106 34

Something 0 106 35
official?” 0 106 35
The 0 106 35
librarian 0 106 35
took 0 106 35
me 0 106 35
to 0 106 35
the 0 106 35
reference 0 106 35
section 0 106 35
and 0 106 35
showed 0 106 35
me 0 106 35
the 0 106 35
shelves 0 106 35
of 0 106 35
encyclicals, 0 106 35
documents 0 106 35
and 0 106 35
histories. 0 106 35

Saints 0 106 36
and 0 106 36
popes 0 106 36
from 0 106 36
one 0 106 36
end 0 106 36
of 0 106 36
the 0 106 36
stacks 0 106 36
to 0 106 36
the 0 106 36
other. 0 106 36

Having 0 106 37
no 0 106 37
clear 0 106 37
idea 0 106 37
what 0 106 37
my 0 106 37
own 0 106 37
question 0 106 37
meant, 0 106 37
I 0 106 37
just 0 106 37
picked 0 106 37
one 0 106 37
at 0 106 37
random. 0 106 37

The 0 106 38
description 0 106 38
of 0 106 38
the 0 106 38
Holy 0 106 38
Eucharist 0 106 38
as 0 106 38
the 0 106 38
supreme 0 106 38
Centre 0 106 38
from 0 106 38
which 0 106 38
all 0 106 38
our 0 106 38
life 0 106 38
as 0 106 38
Catholics 0 106 38
flow, 0 106 38
and 0 106 38
from 0 106 38
which 0 106 38
all 0 106 38
other 0 106 38
doctrines 0 106 38
radiated, 0 106 38
was 0 106 38
something 0 106 38
that 0 106 38
was 0 106 38
not 0 106 38
going 0 106 38
to 0 106 38
come 0 106 38
into 0 106 38
my 0 106 38
head 0 106 38
for 0 106 38
another 0 106 38
eight 0 106 38
years 0 106 38
of 0 106 38
reading. 0 106 38

But 0 106 39
even 0 106 39
so, 0 106 39
Mysterium 0 106 39
Fidei 0 106 39
forced 0 106 39
me 0 106 39
to 0 106 39
face 0 106 39
up 0 106 39
to 0 106 39
a 0 106 39
reality 0 106 39
I’d 0 106 39
never 0 106 39
dreamed 0 106 39
of 0 106 39
before; 0 106 39
that 0 106 39
this, 0 106 39
the 0 106 39
little 0 106 39
unassuming 0 106 39
wafer, 0 106 39
was 0 106 39
the 0 106 39
most 0 106 39
important 0 106 39
thing 0 106 39
in 0 106 39
the 0 106 39
world. 0 106 39

Reading 0 106 40
through 0 106 40
the 0 106 40
encyclical 0 106 40
again, 0 106 40
holding 0 106 40
it 0 106 40
up 0 106 40
next 0 106 40
to 0 106 40
the 0 106 40
current 0 106 40
situation 0 106 40
in 0 106 40
Rome, 0 106 40
makes 0 106 40
it 0 106 40
easier 0 106 40
to 0 106 40
clarify 0 106 40
certain 0 106 40
critical 0 106 40
issues. 0 106 40

Given 0 106 41
what 0 106 41
we 0 106 41
are 0 106 41
now 0 106 41
seeing, 0 106 41
consider 0 106 41
the 0 106 41
poignancy 0 106 41
of 0 106 41
the 0 106 41
following 0 106 41
passages: 0 106 41

When 0 106 42
dealing 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
restoration 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
sacred 0 106 42
liturgy, 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
Fathers 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
council, 0 106 42
by 0 106 42
reason 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
their 0 106 42
pastoral 0 106 42
concern 0 106 42
for 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
whole 0 106 42
Church, 0 106 42
considered 0 106 42
it 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
highest 0 106 42
importance 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
exhort 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
faithful 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
participate 0 106 42
actively 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
sound 0 106 42
faith 0 106 42
and 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
utmost 0 106 42
devotion 0 106 42
in 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
celebration 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
this 0 106 42
Most 0 106 42
Holy 0 106 42
Mystery, 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
offer 0 106 42
it 0 106 42
with 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
priest 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
God 0 106 42
as 0 106 42
a 0 106 42
sacrifice 0 106 42
for 0 106 42
their 0 106 42
own 0 106 42
salvation 0 106 42
and 0 106 42
for 0 106 42
that 0 106 42
of 0 106 42
the 0 106 42
whole 0 106 42
world, 0 106 42
and 0 106 42
to 0 106 42
find 0 106 42
in 0 106 42
it 0 106 42
spiritual 0 106 42
nourishment. 0 106 42

This 0 106 43
was, 0 106 43
remember, 0 106 43
1965, 0 106 43
four 0 106 43
years 0 106 43
before 0 106 43
the 0 106 43
New 0 106 43
Mass 0 106 43
was 0 106 43
issued 0 106 43
and 0 106 43
before 0 106 43
Cardinal 0 106 43
Ottaviani 0 106 43
warned 0 106 43
the 0 106 43
pope 0 106 43
that 0 106 43
it 0 106 43
was 0 106 43
precisely 0 106 43
this 1 106 43
sacramental 1 106 43
reality 1 106 43
that 1 106 43
was 1 106 43
about 1 106 43
to 1 106 43
be 1 106 43
catastrophically 1 106 43
obscured. 1 106 43

Who, 0 106 44
reading 0 106 44
this 0 106 44
passage, 0 106 44
does 0 106 44
not 0 106 44
feel 0 106 44
the 0 106 44
urge 0 106 44
to 0 106 44
shout 0 106 44
down 0 106 44
the 0 106 44
years, 0 106 44
to 0 106 44
do 0 106 44
something 0 106 44
to 0 106 44
stave 0 106 44
off 0 106 44
the 0 106 44
disaster 0 106 44
that 0 106 44
was 0 106 44
coming: 0 106 44

[W]e 0 106 45
are 0 106 45
aware 0 106 45
of 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
fact 0 106 45
that, 0 106 45
among 0 106 45
those 0 106 45
who 0 106 45
deal 0 106 45
with 0 106 45
this 0 106 45
Most 0 106 45
Holy 0 106 45
Mystery 0 106 45
in 0 106 45
written 0 106 45
or 0 106 45
spoken 0 106 45
word, 0 106 45
there 0 106 45
are 0 106 45
some 0 106 45
who 0 106 45
with 0 106 45
reference 0 106 45
either 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
Masses 0 106 45
which 0 106 45
are 0 106 45
celebrated 0 106 45
in 0 106 45
private, 0 106 45
or 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
dogma 0 106 45
of 0 106 45
transubstantiation, 0 106 45
or 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
devotion 0 106 45
to 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
Eucharist, 0 106 45
spread 0 106 45
abroad 0 106 45
opinions 0 106 45
which 0 106 45
disturb 0 106 45
the 0 106 45
faithful 0 106 45
and 0 106 45
fill 0 106 45
their 0 106 45
minds 0 106 45
with 0 106 45
no 0 106 45
little 0 106 45
confusion 0 106 45
about 0 106 45
matters 0 106 45
of 0 106 45
faith. 0 106 45

It 0 106 46
is 0 106 46
as 0 106 46
if 0 106 46
everyone 0 106 46
were 0 106 46
permitted 0 106 46
to 0 106 46
consign 0 106 46
to 0 106 46
oblivion 0 106 46
doctrine 0 106 46
already 0 106 46
defined 0 106 46
by 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
Church, 0 106 46
or 0 106 46
else 0 106 46
to 0 106 46
interpret 0 106 46
it 0 106 46
in 0 106 46
such 0 106 46
a 0 106 46
way 0 106 46
as 0 106 46
to 0 106 46
weaken 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
genuine 0 106 46
meaning 0 106 46
of 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
words 0 106 46
or 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
recognized 0 106 46
force 0 106 46
of 0 106 46
the 0 106 46
concepts 0 106 46
involved. 0 106 46

Keeping 0 106 47
Cardinal 0 106 47
Ottaviani’s 0 106 47
Intervention 0 106 47
directly 0 106 47
before 0 106 47
our 0 106 47
thoughts, 0 106 47
we 0 106 47
read 0 106 47
with 0 106 47
a 0 106 47
strange 0 106 47
kind 0 106 47
of 0 106 47
helpless 0 106 47
dread… 0 106 47

…it 1 106 48
is 1 106 48
not 1 106 48
allowable 1 106 48
to 1 106 48
emphasize 1 106 48
what 1 106 48
is 1 106 48
called 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
“communal” 1 106 48
Mass 1 106 48
to 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
disparagement 1 106 48
of 1 106 48
Masses 1 106 48
celebrated 1 106 48
in 1 106 48
private, 1 106 48
or 1 106 48
to 1 106 48
exaggerate 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
element 1 106 48
of 1 106 48
sacramental 1 106 48
sign 1 106 48
as 1 106 48
if 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
symbolism, 1 106 48
which 1 106 48
all 1 106 48
certainly 1 106 48
admit 1 106 48
in 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
Eucharist, 1 106 48
expresses 1 106 48
fully 1 106 48
and 1 106 48
exhausts 1 106 48
completely 1 106 48
the 1 106 48
mode 1 106 48
of 1 106 48
Christ’s 1 106 48
presence 1 106 48
in 1 106 48
this 1 106 48
sacrament. 1 106 48

Nor 1 106 49
is 1 106 49
it 1 106 49
allowable 1 106 49
to 1 106 49
discuss 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
mystery 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
transubstantiation 1 106 49
without 1 106 49
mentioning 1 106 49
what 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
Council 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
Trent 1 106 49
stated 1 106 49
about 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
marvelous 1 106 49
conversion 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
whole 1 106 49
substance 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
bread 1 106 49
into 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
Body 1 106 49
and 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
whole 1 106 49
substance 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
wine 1 106 49
into 1 106 49
the 1 106 49
Blood 1 106 49
of 1 106 49
Christ, 1 106 49
speaking 1 106 49
rather 1 106 49
only 1 106 49

“transfiguration,” 1 106 49

And 0 106 51
therefore, 0 106 51
so 0 106 51
that 0 106 51
the 0 106 51

Those 0 106 53
of 0 106 53
us 0 106 53
writing 0 106 53
similar 0 106 53
jeremiads 0 106 53
now 0 106 53
have 0 106 53
been 0 106 53
working 0 106 53
to 0 106 53
clarify 0 106 53
that 0 106 53
the 0 106 53
attack 0 106 53
from 0 106 53
Rome 0 106 53
on 0 106 53
the 0 106 53
moral 0 106 53
doctrine 0 106 53
of 0 106 53
the 0 106 53
Church 0 106 53
isn’t 0 106 53
about 0 106 53
marriage. 0 106 53

It’s 0 106 54
about 0 106 54
the 0 106 54
Eucharist 0 106 54
and 0 106 54
to 0 106 54
a 0 106 54
lesser 0 106 54
extent 0 106 54
the 0 106 54
priesthood. 0 106 54

The 1 106 55
demonic 1 106 55
forces 1 106 55
we 1 106 55
know 1 106 55
are 1 106 55
the 1 106 55
driving 1 106 55
force 1 106 55
behind 1 106 55
this 1 106 55
supreme 1 106 55
moment 1 106 55
of 1 106 55
heresy 1 106 55
and 1 106 55
destruction 1 106 55
aren’t 1 106 55
really 1 106 55
looking 1 106 55
at 1 106 55
the 1 106 55
undermining 1 106 55
of 1 106 55
marriage 1 106 55
as 1 106 55
their 1 106 55
primary 1 106 55
goal; 1 106 55
they 1 106 55
want 1 106 55
to 1 106 55
get 1 106 55
at 1 106 55
the 1 106 55
Eucharist. 1 106 55

We 1 106 56
know 1 106 56
it 1 106 56
is 1 106 56
demonically 1 106 56
inspired 1 106 56
because 1 106 56
their 1 106 56
hatred 1 106 56
is 1 106 56
for 1 106 56
Christ 1 106 56
Himself 1 106 56
in 1 106 56
the 1 106 56
first 1 106 56
place 1 106 56
and 1 106 56
for 1 106 56
anyone 1 106 56
who 1 106 56
loves 1 106 56
and 1 106 56
wants 1 106 56
to 1 106 56
serve 1 106 56
Him 1 106 56
second. 1 106 56

They 1 106 57
are 1 106 57
men 1 106 57
who 1 106 57
refuse 1 106 57
to 1 106 57
bend 1 106 57
the 1 106 57
knee 1 106 57
before 1 106 57
the 1 106 57
God 1 106 57
whom 1 106 57
they 1 106 57
will 1 106 57
not 1 106 57
serve. 1 106 57

This 0 106 58
knowledge 0 106 58
– 0 106 58
that 0 106 58
the 0 106 58
attack 0 106 58
is 0 106 58
on 0 106 58
the 0 106 58
Body 0 106 58
and 0 106 58
Blood 0 106 58
of 0 106 58
Christ 0 106 58
– 0 106 58
can 0 106 58
also 0 106 58
help 0 106 58
readers 0 106 58
spot 0 106 58
their 0 106 58
friends 0 106 58
in 0 106 58
the 0 106 58
crowd. 0 106 58

The 0 106 59
places 0 106 59
where 0 106 59
Eucharistic 0 106 59
adoration 0 106 59
is 0 106 59
still 0 106 59
offered 0 106 59
are 0 106 59
places 0 106 59
where 0 106 59
at 0 106 59
least 0 106 59
some 0 106 59
flicker 0 106 59
of 0 106 59
the 0 106 59
true 0 106 59

The 0 106 60
bishops 0 106 60
and 0 106 60
priests 0 106 60
now 0 106 60
talking 0 106 60
about 0 106 60
the 0 106 60
supreme 0 106 60
glory 0 106 60
of 0 106 60
the 0 106 60

the 0 106 60
need 0 106 60
to 0 106 60
defend 0 106 60
it 0 106 60
from 0 106 60
sacrilege, 0 106 60
are 0 106 60
lighthouses. 0 106 60

A 0 106 61
case 0 106 61
in 0 106 61
point 0 106 61
is 0 106 61
Bishop 0 106 61
Mark 0 106 61
Davies, 0 106 61
of 0 106 61
my 0 106 61

former 0 106 61
diocese 0 106 61
of 0 106 61
Shrewsbury 0 106 61
in 0 106 61
England. 0 106 61

In 0 106 62
March, 0 106 62
2016, 0 106 62
in 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
midst 0 106 62
of 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
shouting 0 106 62
from 0 106 62
Rome, 0 106 62
Bishop 0 106 62
Davies 0 106 62
spoke 0 106 62
at 0 106 62
his 0 106 62
Chrism 0 106 62
Mass 0 106 62
said 0 106 62
that 0 106 62
only 0 106 62
through 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
“reality 0 106 62
of 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
Eucharist” 0 106 62
could 0 106 62
new 0 106 62
vocations 0 106 62
to 0 106 62
the 0 106 62
priesthood 0 106 62
be 0 106 62
found. 0 106 62

“In 0 106 63
treasuring 0 106 63
this 0 106 63
gift 0 106 63
of 0 106 63
priestly 0 106 63
celibacy 0 106 63
we 0 106 63
need 0 106 63
to 0 106 63
recognize 0 106 63
more 0 106 63
clearly 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
intimate 0 106 63
link 0 106 63
between 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
Ministerial 0 106 63
Priesthood 0 106 63
and 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
reality 0 106 63
of 0 106 63
the 0 106 63
Eucharist. 0 106 63

If 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
Mass 1 106 64
were 1 106 64
ever 1 106 64
reduced 1 106 64
in 1 106 64
our 1 106 64
minds 1 106 64
to 1 106 64
being 1 106 64
merely 1 106 64
a 1 106 64
commemorative 1 106 64
meal 1 106 64
and 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
priest 1 106 64
as 1 106 64
only 1 106 64
a 1 106 64
community 1 106 64
leader 1 106 64
or 1 106 64
functionary, 1 106 64
then 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
celibacy 1 106 64
of 1 106 64
the 1 106 64
Catholic 1 106 64
Priesthood 1 106 64
might 1 106 64
seem 1 106 64
extravagant.” 1 106 64

It’s 0 106 65
almost 0 106 65
as 0 106 65
if 0 106 65
someone 0 106 65
had 0 106 65
slipped 0 106 65
a 0 106 65
copy 0 106 65
of 0 106 65
the 0 106 65
Ottaviani 0 106 65
Intervention 0 106 65
inside 0 106 65
his 0 106 65
morning 0 106 65
paper. 0 106 65

The 0 106 66
targeting 0 106 66
of 0 106 66
marriage, 0 106 66
through 0 106 66
the 0 106 66
instruments 0 106 66
of 0 106 66
creatures 0 106 66
like 0 106 66
the 0 106 66
myopic 0 106 66
and 0 106 66
theologically 0 106 66
tunnel-visioned 0 106 66
Cardinal 0 106 66
Kasper, 0 106 66
is 1 106 66
demonically 1 106 66
brilliant. 1 106 66

It’s 0 106 67
a 0 106 67
“stitch-up” 0 106 67
as 0 106 67
the 0 106 67
English 0 106 67
call 0 106 67
it; 0 106 67
a 0 106 67
fix. 0 106 67

You 0 106 68
make 0 106 68
it 0 106 68
a 0 106 68
matter 0 106 68
of 0 106 68
“mercy” 0 106 68
(backed 0 106 68
up 0 106 68
by 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
iron 0 106 68
fist) 0 106 68
that 0 106 68
no 0 106 68
one 0 106 68
in 0 106 68
a 0 106 68
state 0 106 68
of 0 106 68
objective 0 106 68
mortal 0 106 68
sin 0 106 68
can 0 106 68
be 0 106 68
refused 0 106 68
Holy 0 106 68
Communion; 0 106 68
you 0 106 68
give 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
national 0 106 68
bishops 0 106 68
conferences 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
power 0 106 68
to 0 106 68
start 0 106 68
enforcing 0 106 68
this, 0 106 68
and 0 106 68
you 0 106 68
have 0 106 68
created 0 106 68
a 0 106 68
previously 0 106 68
unimaginable 0 106 68
situation 0 106 68
in 0 106 68
the 0 106 68
Church. 0 106 68

You 0 106 69
have 0 106 69
created 0 106 69
a 0 106 69
regime 0 106 69
in 0 106 69
which 0 106 69
a 0 106 69
refusal 0 106 69
to 0 106 69
desecrate 0 106 69
the 0 106 69
sacred 0 106 69
species 0 106 69
will 0 106 69
be 0 106 69
grounds 0 106 69
for 0 106 69
persecution 0 106 69
of 0 106 69
faithful 0 106 69
priests, 0 106 69
seminarians 0 106 69
and 0 106 69
laity. 0 106 69

And 0 106 70
of 0 106 70
course, 0 106 70
we 0 106 70
are 0 106 70
seeing 0 106 70
it 0 106 70
starting 0 106 70
already. 0 106 70

It’s 0 106 71
a 0 106 71
brilliant 0 106 71
strategy, 0 106 71
the 0 106 71
magic 0 106 71
bullet 0 106 71
that 0 106 71
will 0 106 71
revert 0 106 71
the 0 106 71
Church 0 106 71
to 0 106 71
the 0 106 71
1976 0 106 71
model 0 106 71
on 0 106 71
every 0 106 71
front, 0 106 71
and 0 106 71
very 0 106 71
likely 0 106 71
keep 0 106 71
it 0 106 71
there 0 106 71
forever. 0 106 71

As 0 106 72
if 0 106 72
the 0 106 72
goal 0 106 72
was 0 106 72
to 0 106 72
go 0 106 72
back 0 106 72
in 0 106 72
time 0 106 72
and 0 106 72
erase 0 106 72
the 0 106 72
entire 0 106 72
John 0 106 72
Paul 0 106 72
II/Benedict 0 106 72
XVI 0 106 72
period 0 106 72
out 0 106 72
of 0 106 72
history. 0 106 72

It 0 106 73
will 0 106 73
halt 0 106 73
the 0 106 73
revival 0 106 73
of 0 106 73
eucharistic 0 106 73
piety 0 106 73
among 0 106 73
seminarians; 0 106 73
in 0 106 73
fact, 0 106 73
it 0 106 73
will 0 106 73
reverse 0 106 73
the 0 106 73
general 0 106 73
reforming 0 106 73
trend 0 106 73
of 0 106 73
“conservative” 0 106 73
seminaries 0 106 73
that 0 106 73
was 0 106 73
such 0 106 73
a 0 106 73
feature 0 106 73
under 0 106 73
John 0 106 73
Paul 0 106 73
II 0 106 73
and 0 106 73
has 0 106 73
for 0 106 73
30 0 106 73
years 0 106 73
been 0 106 73
the 0 106 73
hook 0 106 73
upon 0 106 73
which 0 106 73
all 0 106 73
hopes 0 106 73
of 0 106 73
restoration 0 106 73
have 0 106 73
hung. 0 106 73

It 0 106 74
is 0 106 74
easy 0 106 74
to 0 106 74
see 0 106 74
what 0 106 74
is 0 106 74
coming 0 106 74
next. 0 106 74

Once 0 106 75
certain 0 106 75
announcements 0 106 75
are 0 106 75
published 0 106 75
in 0 106 75
parish 0 106 75
bulletins, 0 106 75
laity 0 106 75
will 0 106 75
have 0 106 75
to 0 106 75
consider 0 106 75
whether 0 106 75
they 0 106 75
can, 0 106 75
in 0 106 75
conscience, 0 106 75
continue 0 106 75
to 0 106 75
assist 0 106 75
at 0 106 75
Masses 0 106 75
where 0 106 75
systematic 0 106 75
sacrilege 0 106 75
has 0 106 75
been 0 106 75
formally 0 106 75
adopted 0 106 75
as 0 106 75
the 0 106 75
rule. 0 106 75

The 0 106 76
few 0 106 76
bishops 0 106 76
with 0 106 76
sufficient 0 106 76
spine 0 106 76

ruling 1 106 76
embattled 1 106 76
islands 1 106 76

Catholicism 1 106 76

a 1 106 76
poisoned 1 106 76
sea 1 106 76
of 1 106 76
systematic 1 106 76
heresy 1 106 76
and 1 106 76
desecration. 1 106 76

A 1 106 77
dark, 1 106 77
impenetrable 1 106 77
and 1 106 77
“irreversible” 1 106 77
winter 1 106 77
of 1 106 77
persecution 1 106 77
of 1 106 77
the 1 106 77

their 1 106 77

Not 0 106 78
being 0 106 78
a 0 106 78
theologian 0 106 78
I 0 106 78
have 0 106 78
no 0 106 78
idea 0 106 78
if 0 106 78
this 0 106 78
encyclical 0 106 78
is, 0 106 78
as 0 106 78
so 0 106 78
many 0 106 78
of 0 106 78
these 0 106 78
seemingly 0 106 78
orthodox 0 106 78
documents 0 106 78
of 0 106 78
that 0 106 78
period 0 106 78
seem 0 106 78
to 0 106 78
be, 0 106 78
rife 0 106 78
with 0 106 78
the 0 106 78
usual 0 106 78
“time 0 106 78
bombs,” 0 106 78
ambiguities, 0 106 78
mushy 0 106 78
language 0 106 78
or 0 106 78
even 0 106 78
outright 0 106 78
errors. 0 106 78

I 0 106 79
haven’t 0 106 79
looked 0 106 79
it 0 106 79
up. 0 106 79

I’m 0 106 80
sure 0 106 80
there 0 106 80
are 0 106 80
plenty 0 106 80
of 0 106 80
people 0 106 80
out 0 106 80
there 0 106 80
qualified 0 106 80
to 0 106 80
examine 0 106 80
it 0 106 80
to 0 106 80
see 0 106 80
if 0 106 80
it’s 0 106 80
safe 0 106 80
for 0 106 80
Trad-Catholic 0 106 80
consumption. 0 106 80

And 0 106 81
I 0 106 81
have 0 106 81
no 0 106 81
doubt 0 106 81
at 0 106 81
all 0 106 81
that 0 106 81
there 0 106 81
are 0 106 81
better, 0 106 81
more 0 106 81
venerable, 0 106 81
even 0 106 81
more 0 106 81
sublime 0 106 81
and 0 106 81
poignant 0 106 81
works 0 106 81
on 0 106 81
the 0 106 81
Eucharist 0 106 81
in 0 106 81
the 0 106 81
canon 0 106 81
of 0 106 81
“official” 0 106 81
things. 0 106 81

From 0 106 82
saints 0 106 82
and 0 106 82
Doctors 0 106 82
of 0 106 82
the 0 106 82
Church 0 106 82
and 0 106 82
whatnot, 0 106 82
many 0 106 82
of 0 106 82
which 0 106 82
the 0 106 82
pope 0 106 82
cited. 0 106 82

But 1 106 83
whatever 1 106 83
its 1 106 83
flaws, 1 106 83
Mysterium 1 106 83
Fidei 1 106 83
is 1 106 83
the 1 106 83
one 1 106 83
I 1 106 83
found, 1 106 83
and 1 106 83
I’m 1 106 83
convinced 1 106 83
it 1 106 83
wasn’t 1 106 83
an 1 106 83
accident. 1 106 83

O 0 106 84
God, 0 106 84
in 0 106 84
Your 0 106 84
infinite 0 106 84
mercy, 0 106 84
forgive 0 106 84
and 0 106 84
have 0 106 84
mercy 0 106 84
on 0 106 84
Pope 0 106 84
Paul 0 106 84
VI 0 106 84
Montini 0 106 84
for 0 106 84
whatever 0 106 84
neglect 0 106 84
or 0 106 84
damage 0 106 84
of 0 106 84
which 0 106 84
he 0 106 84
may 0 106 84
have 0 106 84
been 0 106 84
guilty. 0 106 84

In 0 106 85
this 0 106 85
one 0 106 85
case 0 106 85
at 0 106 85
least, 0 106 85
a 0 106 85
work 0 106 85
of 0 106 85
his 0 106 85
was 0 106 85
the 0 106 85
exact 0 106 85
right 0 106 85
thing 0 106 85
at 0 106 85
the 0 106 85
exact 0 106 85
right 0 106 85
time. 0 106 85

For 0 106 86
me 0 106 86
at 0 106 86
least 0 106 86
it 0 106 86
was 0 106 86
the 0 106 86
key 0 106 86
that 0 106 86
opened 0 106 86
the 0 106 86
Door 0 106 86
to 0 106 86

the 0 109 3

15-year 0 109 11

in 0 109 11
Iraq 0 109 11

the 0 109 14

Who 0 109 17
then 0 109 17
enforces 0 109 17

Consider 0 109 18
what 0 109 18
is 0 109 18
happening 0 109 18
in 0 109 18
Syria. 0 109 18

But 0 109 22
if 0 109 22

that 1 109 22

Do 1 109 23

pack 1 109 23

do 1 109 24
we 1 109 24

crucial 0 109 25
questions 0 109 25
now 0 109 25
before 0 109 25

Would 0 109 26
President 0 109 26

be 0 109 26
willing 0 109 26
to 0 109 26

a 0 109 26

its 0 109 26
position 0 109 26
in 0 109 26
Iraq 0 109 26
and 0 109 26
Syria? 0 109 26

Would 1 109 27
the 1 109 27
American 1 109 27
people 1 109 27
support 1 109 27
such 1 109 27
a 1 109 27
war 1 109 27
with 1 109 27
U.S. 1 109 27
troops? 1 109 27

Would 0 109 28
Congress, 0 109 28
apparently 1 109 28
clueless 1 109 28
to 1 109 28
the 1 109 28

war 0 109 28
in 0 109 28
Syria 0 109 28
or 0 109 28
Iraq? 0 109 28

If 0 109 29
Trump 0 109 29
and 0 109 29
his 0 109 29
generals 0 109 29
felt 0 109 29
our 0 109 29
vital 0 109 29
interests 0 109 29
could 0 109 29
not 0 109 29
allow 0 109 29
Syria 0 109 29
and 0 109 29
Iraq 0 109 29
to 0 109 29
drift 0 109 29
into 0 109 29
the 0 109 29
orbit 0 109 29
of 0 109 29
Iran, 0 109 29
where 0 109 29
would 0 109 29
we 0 109 29
find 0 109 29
allies 0 109 29
for 0 109 29
such 0 109 29
a 0 109 29
fight? 0 109 29

If 1 109 30
we 1 109 30
rely 1 109 30
on 1 109 30
the 1 109 30
Kurds 1 109 30
in 1 109 30
Syria, 1 109 30
we 1 109 30
lose 1 109 30
NATO 1 109 30
ally 1 109 30
Turkey, 1 109 30
which 1 109 30
regards 1 109 30
Syria's 1 109 30
Kurds 1 109 30
as 1 109 30
collaborators 1 109 30
of 1 109 30
the 1 109 30
PKK 1 109 30
in 1 109 30

which 1 109 30
even 1 109 30
the 1 109 30
U.S. 1 109 30
designates 1 109 30
a 1 109 30
terrorist 1 109 30
organization. 1 109 30

The 0 109 31
decision 0 109 31
as 0 109 31
to 0 109 31
whether 0 109 31
this 0 109 31
country 0 109 31
should 0 109 31
engage 0 109 31
in 0 109 31
new 0 109 31
post-ISIS 0 109 31
wars 0 109 31
in 0 109 31
the 0 109 31
Mideast, 0 109 31
however, 0 109 31
may 0 109 31
be 0 109 31
taken 0 109 31
out 0 109 31
of 0 109 31
our 0 109 31
hands. 0 109 31

Saturday, 0 109 32
Israel 0 109 32
launched 0 109 32
new 0 109 32

shells 0 109 32
fired 0 109 32
into 0 109 32
the 0 109 32
Golan 0 109 32
Heights. 0 109 32

Damascus 0 109 33
claims 0 109 33
that 0 109 33
Israel's 0 109 33
"terrorist" 1 109 33
allies 0 109 33
inside 0 109 33
Syria 0 109 33
fired 0 109 33
the 0 109 33
shells, 0 109 33
to 0 109 33
give 0 109 33
the 0 109 33
IDF 0 109 33
an 0 109 33
excuse 0 109 33
to 0 109 33
attack. 0 109 33

Why 0 109 34
would 0 109 34
Israel 0 109 34
wish 0 109 34
to 0 109 34
provoke 0 109 34
a 0 109 34
war 0 109 34
with 0 109 34
Syria? 0 109 34

Because 0 109 35
the 0 109 35
Israelis 0 109 35
see 0 109 35
the 0 109 35
outcome 0 109 35
of 0 109 35
the 0 109 35
six-year 0 109 35
Syrian 0 109 35
civil 0 109 35
war 0 109 35
as 0 109 35
a 0 109 35
strategic 0 109 35
disaster. 0 109 35

Hezbollah, 0 109 36
stronger 0 109 36
than 0 109 36
ever, 0 109 36
was 0 109 36
part 0 109 36
of 0 109 36
Assad's 0 109 36
victorious 0 109 36
coalition. 0 109 36

Iran 0 109 37
may 0 109 37
have 0 109 37
secured 0 109 37
its 0 109 37
land 0 109 37
corridor 0 109 37
from 0 109 37
Tehran 0 109 37
to 0 109 37
Beirut. 0 109 37

Its 0 109 38
presence 0 109 38
in 0 109 38
Syria 0 109 38
could 0 109 38
now 0 109 38
be 0 109 38
permanent. 0 109 38

And 1 109 39
only 1 109 39
one 1 109 39
force 1 109 39
in 1 109 39
the 1 109 39
region 1 109 39

the 1 109 39
power 1 109 39
to 1 109 39
reverse 1 109 39
the 1 109 39
present 1 109 39

Syria's 1 109 39
civil 1 109 39
war--the 1 109 39
United 1 109 39

Bibi 0 109 40
Netanyahu 0 109 40

that 0 109 40
if 0 109 40
war 0 109 40
with 0 109 40
Syria 0 109 40
breaks 0 109 40
out, 0 109 40
a 0 109 40
clamor 0 109 40
will 0 109 40
arise 0 109 40
in 0 109 40
Congress 0 109 40

stand 1 111 6

On 0 111 21
multiple 0 111 21
occasions, 0 111 21
Kavanaugh 0 111 21
has 0 111 21
been 0 111 21
the 0 111 21
lone 0 111 21
voice 0 111 21
when 0 111 21
it 0 111 21
comes 0 111 21
supporting 0 111 21
the 0 111 21
state’s 0 111 21

warrantlessly 0 111 21

As 0 111 22
Reason 0 111 22
points 0 111 22
out, 0 111 22
in 0 111 22
2010 0 111 22
he 0 111 22
dissented 0 111 22
from 0 111 22
the 0 111 22
D.C. 0 111 22
Circuit’s 0 111 22

not 0 111 22
to 0 111 22
rehear 0 111 22
a 0 111 22
case 0 111 22
in 0 111 22
which 0 111 22
a 0 111 22
three-judge 0 111 22
panel 0 111 22
had 0 111 22
ruled 0 111 22
that 0 111 22
police 0 111 22
violated 0 111 22
a 0 111 22

drug 0 111 22
dealer’s 0 111 22
Fourth 0 111 22
Amendment 0 111 22
rights 0 111 22
when 0 111 22
they 0 111 22
tracked 0 111 22
his 0 111 22
movements 0 111 22
for 0 111 22
a 0 111 22
month 0 111 22

attaching 0 111 22
a 0 111 22
GPS 0 111 22

to 0 111 22
his 0 111 22
car 0 111 22
without 0 111 22
a 0 111 22
warrant. 0 111 22

Kavanaugh 0 111 23
claimed 0 111 23
that 0 111 23
putting 0 111 23
a 0 111 23
GPS 0 111 23
tracking 0 111 23
device 0 111 23
on 0 111 23
a 0 111 23
person’s 0 111 23
car 0 111 23
without 0 111 23
first 0 111 23
obtaining 0 111 23
a 0 111 23
warrant 0 111 23
was 0 111 23
just 0 111 23
fine 0 111 23
because 0 111 23
it 0 111 23
didn’t 0 111 23
constitute 0 111 23
a 0 111 23
“search” 0 111 23
as 0 111 23
defined 0 111 23
by 0 111 23
the 0 111 23
Fourth 0 111 23
Amendment. 0 111 23

To 0 111 24
Kavanaugh, 0 111 24
bypassing 0 111 24
the 0 111 24
courts 0 111 24
and 0 111 24
tracking 0 111 24
an 0 111 24
individual 0 111 24
without 0 111 24
their 0 111 24
consent 0 111 24
is 0 111 24
“constitutional.” 0 111 24
In 0 111 24
this 0 111 24
line 0 111 24
of 0 111 24
thinking, 0 111 24
the 0 111 24
Fourth 0 111 24
Amendment 0 111 24
is 0 111 24
not 0 111 24
violated 0 111 24
even 0 111 24
if 0 111 24
police 0 111 24
trespass 0 111 24
on 0 111 24
someone’s 0 111 24
physical 0 111 24
property, 0 111 24
or 0 111 24
track 0 111 24
someone’s 0 111 24
cell 0 111 24
phone. 0 111 24

Luckily, 0 111 25
he 0 111 25
was 0 111 25
the 0 111 25
only 0 111 25
judge 0 111 25
on 0 111 25
the 0 111 25
panel 0 111 25
to 0 111 25
think 0 111 25
this. 0 111 25

In 0 111 26
June, 0 111 26
the 0 111 26
Supreme 0 111 26
Court 0 111 26
ruled 0 111 26
specifically 0 111 26
on 0 111 26
this 0 111 26
case 0 111 26
noting 0 111 26
that 0 111 26
collecting 0 111 26
such 0 111 26
information 0 111 26
actually 0 111 26
does 0 111 26
constitute 0 111 26
a 0 111 26
search 0 111 26
and 0 111 26
therefore 0 111 26
requires 0 111 26
a 0 111 26
warrant. 0 111 26

But 0 111 27
it 0 111 27
gets 0 111 27
worse. 0 111 27

In 0 111 28
2015, 0 111 28
Kavanaugh 0 111 28
issued 0 111 28
a 0 111 28
statement 0 111 28
strongly 0 111 28
defending 0 111 28
the 0 111 28
NSA’s 0 111 28
phone 0 111 28
metadata 0 111 28
collection 0 111 28
program, 0 111 28
arguing 0 111 28
that 0 111 28
it 0 111 28
is 0 111 28
“entirely 0 111 28
consistent 0 111 28
with 0 111 28
the 0 111 28
Fourth 0 111 28
Amendment.” 0 111 28
To 0 111 28
Kavanaugh, 0 111 28
sweeping 0 111 28
programs 0 111 28
that 0 111 28
collect 0 111 28
information 0 111 28
from 0 111 28
innocent 0 111 28
citizens’ 0 111 28
phones 0 111 28
are 0 111 28
not 0 111 28
in 0 111 28
conflict 0 111 28
with 0 111 28
having 0 111 28
the 0 111 28
right 0 111 28
to 0 111 28
be 0 111 28
free 0 111 28
from 0 111 28
unlawful 0 111 28
search 0 111 28
and 0 111 28
seizure. 0 111 28

Seriously. 1 111 29

According 0 111 30
to 0 111 30
Kavanaugh, 0 111 30
the 0 111 30
Fourth 0 111 30
Amendment 0 111 30
allows 0 111 30
for 0 111 30
searches 0 111 30
“without 0 111 30
individualized 0 111 30
suspicion” 0 111 30
when 0 111 30
the 0 111 30
government 0 111 30
demonstrates 0 111 30
a 0 111 30
“special 0 111 30
need” 0 111 30
that 0 111 30
“outweighs 0 111 30
the 0 111 30
intrusion 0 111 30
on 0 111 30
individual 0 111 30
liberty.” 0 111 30

Exactly 0 111 31
what 0 111 31
this 0 111 31
“special 0 111 31
need” 0 111 31
is 0 111 31
that 0 111 31
can 0 111 31
constitute 0 111 31
a 0 111 31
Gestapo 1 111 31
like 1 111 31
police 1 111 31
state 1 111 31
surveilling 1 111 31

citizens 0 111 31
is 0 111 31
a 0 111 31
moving 0 111 31
target 0 111 31
that 0 111 31
has 0 111 31
already 0 111 31
been 0 111 31
proven 0 111 31
to 0 111 31
be 0 111 31
abused 0 111 31
over 0 111 31
and 0 111 31
over 0 111 31
again. 0 111 31

“The 0 111 32
sacrifice 0 111 32
of 0 111 32
our 0 111 32
personal 0 111 32
liberty 0 111 32
for 0 111 32

is 0 111 32
and 0 111 32
will 0 111 32
forever 0 111 32
be 0 111 32
a 0 111 32
false 0 111 32
choice,” 0 111 32
Senator 0 111 32
Rand 0 111 32
Paul 0 111 32
said 0 111 32
of 0 111 32
Kavanaugh’s 0 111 32
views 0 111 32
on 0 111 32
the 0 111 32
disposable 0 111 32
nature 0 111 32
of 0 111 32
the 0 111 32
constitution. 0 111 32

Kavanaugh 0 111 33
“has 0 111 33
no 0 111 33
qualms 0 111 33
about 0 111 33
applying 0 111 33

and 0 111 33
he 0 111 33
has 0 111 33
endorsed 0 111 33
the 0 111 33
idea 0 111 33
of 0 111 33
a 0 111 33

to 0 111 33
the 0 111 33

are 0 111 34
trying 0 111 34
to 0 111 34
draw 0 111 34
attention 0 111 34
to 0 111 34
the 0 111 34

an 1 111 34

Representative 0 111 35

While 0 115 27
we 0 115 27
don’t 0 115 27
condone 0 115 27
the 0 115 27

both 0 115 27

So, 0 115 28
file 0 115 28
it! 0 115 28

On 1 115 29
the 1 115 29
basis 1 115 29
of 1 115 29
what, 1 115 29
Mr. 0 115 29
Wallace? 0 115 29

The 0 115 30
free 0 115 30
press 0 115 30
still 0 115 30
exists, 0 115 30
and 0 115 30
you 0 115 30
know 0 115 30
what? 0 115 30

Jim 0 115 31
Acosta 0 115 31
and 0 115 31
CNN 0 115 31
continue 0 115 31
to 0 115 31
lie, 1 115 31
just 0 115 31
like 0 115 31
they 0 115 31
have 0 115 31
for 0 115 31
decades, 0 115 31
and 0 115 31
here's 0 115 31
the 0 115 31
proof. 0 115 31

Look 0 115 32
how 0 115 32
they 0 115 32
doctored 0 115 32
the 0 115 32
video 0 115 32
to 0 115 32
not 0 115 32
show 0 115 32
what 0 115 32
clearly 0 115 32
took 0 115 32
place 0 115 32
and 0 115 32
then 0 115 32
lied 1 115 32
about 0 115 32
it, 0 115 32
and 0 115 32
I 0 115 32
suppose 0 115 32
Fox 0 115 32
falls 0 115 32
right 0 115 32
in 0 115 32
line 0 115 32
with 0 115 32
that 0 115 32
behavior. 0 115 32

So, 0 115 33
Fox 0 115 33
joins 0 115 33
with 0 115 33
the 1 115 33
least 1 115 33

something 0 115 33
that 0 115 33
is 0 115 33
the 0 115 33
White 0 115 33

it's 0 115 33
about 0 115 33

not. 0 115 34

WHCA 0 115 37

President 0 115 38

However, 0 115 38
several 0 115 38
prominent 0 115 38

the 1 115 38

As 0 115 39
they 0 115 39
should. 0 115 39

It's 0 115 40
frivolous, 1 115 40
but 0 115 40
because 0 115 40
they 0 115 40
are 0 115 40

it's 0 115 40

it's 0 115 40

asked 0 115 45

of 0 115 45
which 0 115 45
the 0 115 45

physically 0 115 45

that 0 115 45

was 0 115 47
thrilled 0 115 47
as 0 115 47

the 0 115 52
thing, 0 115 52
if 0 115 52
it 0 115 52

scientists 1 116 0
aren’t 1 116 0
worried 1 116 0

In 0 116 1
what 0 116 1
is 0 116 1
being 0 116 1
considered 0 116 1
a 0 116 1
particularly 0 116 1
rare 0 116 1
event, 0 116 1
scientists 0 116 1

projecting 0 116 1
that 0 116 1
the 0 116 1

customer 0 116 1
by 0 116 1
the 0 116 1

2050. 0 116 1

observations 0 116 2
from 0 116 2

of 0 116 2
Sun 0 116 2
research, 0 116 2
experts 0 116 2
are 0 116 2
predicting 0 116 2
a 0 116 2
“Grand 0 116 2
Solar 0 116 2
Minimum” 0 116 2
will 0 116 2
occur 0 116 2
a 0 116 2
few 0 116 2
decades 0 116 2
from 0 116 2

it 0 116 2
has 0 116 2
been 0 116 2
for 0 116 2
a 0 116 2
very 0 116 2
long 0 116 2
time. 0 116 2

The 0 116 3
Sun 0 116 3
might 0 116 3
look 0 116 3
the 0 116 3
same 0 116 3
to 0 116 3
you 0 116 3
today 0 116 3
as 0 116 3
it 0 116 3
has 0 116 3
since 0 116 3
the 0 116 3
first 0 116 3
time 0 116 3
you 0 116 3
laid 0 116 3
eyes 0 116 3
on 0 116 3
it, 0 116 3
but 0 116 3
our 0 116 3
star 0 116 3
actually 0 116 3
displays 0 116 3
plenty 0 116 3
of 0 116 3
changes. 0 116 3

The 0 116 4
Sun 0 116 4
goes 0 116 4
through 0 116 4
regular 0 116 4
cycles 0 116 4
of 0 116 4
solar 0 116 4
minimums 0 116 4
and 0 116 4
solar 0 116 4
maximums, 0 116 4
which 0 116 4
are 0 116 4
periods 0 116 4
where 0 116 4
the 0 116 4
Sun 0 116 4
is 0 116 4
either 0 116 4
quite 0 116 4
calm 0 116 4
(the 0 116 4
minimum) 0 116 4
or 0 116 4
incredibly 0 116 4
active 0 116 4
(the 0 116 4
maximum). 0 116 4

These 0 116 5
patterns 0 116 5
repeat 0 116 5
every 0 116 5
11 0 116 5
years 0 116 5
or 0 116 5
so, 0 116 5
but 0 116 5
new 0 116 5
research 0 116 5
suggests 0 116 5
that 0 116 5
there’s 0 116 5
a 0 116 5
pattern 0 116 5
behind 0 116 5
the 0 116 5
pattern, 0 116 5
and 0 116 5
that 0 116 5
a 0 116 5
particularly 0 116 5
cool 0 116 5
solar 0 116 5
minimum 0 116 5

Lubin’s 0 116 7

forecasted 0 116 7
a 0 116 7
grand 0 116 7

around 0 116 7
seven 0 116 7

cooler 0 116 7
than 0 116 7
the 0 116 7
typical 0 116 7
solar 0 116 7

making 0 116 7
it 0 116 7
a 0 116 7
particularly 0 116 7
calm 0 116 7
moment 0 116 7
for 0 116 7
our 0 116 7
star. 0 116 7

During 0 116 8
a 0 116 8
solar 0 116 8
minimum, 0 116 8
the 0 116 8
Sun 0 116 8
produces 0 116 8
far 0 116 8
fewer 0 116 8
solar 0 116 8
flares 0 116 8
and 0 116 8
sunspots, 0 116 8
and 0 116 8
as 0 116 8
a 0 116 8
result, 0 116 8
much 0 116 8

Earth. 0 116 8

This 0 116 9
can 0 116 9
have 0 116 9
a 0 116 9
number 0 116 9
of 0 116 9
effects 0 116 9
on 0 116 9
our 0 116 9
planet, 0 116 9
including 0 116 9
changes 0 116 9
in 0 116 9
the 0 116 9

temperatures 0 116 9
far 0 116 9

ground. 0 116 9

Those 0 116 10
changes 0 116 10
can 0 116 10
affect 0 116 10
weather, 0 116 10
though 0 116 10
forecasting 0 116 10
specific 0 116 10
differences 0 116 10
has 0 116 10
proven 0 116 10
difficult. 0 116 10

The 0 116 11
grand 0 116 11
minimum 0 116 11
will 0 116 11
be 0 116 11
an 0 116 11
exaggerated 0 116 11
version 0 116 11
of 0 116 11
the 0 116 11
typical 0 116 11
solar 0 116 11
minimum, 0 116 11
and 0 116 11
could 0 116 11
produce 0 116 11
some 0 116 11
very 0 116 11
noticeable 0 116 11
effects. 0 116 11

The 0 116 12
most 0 116 12
recent 0 116 12
grand 0 116 12
minimum 0 116 12
is 0 116 12
thought 0 116 12
to 0 116 12
have 0 116 12
occurred 0 116 12
back 0 116 12
in 0 116 12
the 0 116 12
mid 0 116 12
1600s. 0 116 12

The 0 116 13
event, 0 116 13
called 0 116 13
the 0 116 13
Maunder 0 116 13
Minimum, 0 116 13
is 0 116 13
credited 0 116 13
with 0 116 13
plunging 0 116 13
temperatures 0 116 13
to 0 116 13
the 0 116 13
point 0 116 13
where 0 116 13
the 0 116 13

River 0 116 13
and 0 116 13
Baltic 0 116 13

over. 0 116 13

However, 0 116 14
other 0 116 14
parts 0 116 14
of 0 116 14
the 0 116 14
planet 0 116 14
heated 0 116 14
up, 0 116 14
including 0 116 14
Alaska 0 116 14

far 0 116 14
above 0 116 14
their 0 116 14
normal 0 116 14

This 0 116 15
temporary 0 116 15
shakeup 0 116 15
of 0 116 15
temperatures 0 116 15
could 0 116 15
happen 0 116 15
again, 0 116 15
though 0 116 15
the 0 116 15

say 1 116 15
it 1 116 15

is 0 118 13
that 0 118 13
the 0 118 13

Trump 1 118 14

on 1 118 14
the 1 118 14

interesting! 1 118 17

Now, 0 118 18
it’s 0 118 18
theoretically 0 118 18
possible 0 118 18
that 0 118 18
the 0 118 18

the 0 118 18

that 0 118 18

would 1 118 18
fall 1 118 18

how 1 118 19

that? 1 118 19

Not 0 118 20

it 1 118 21

Art 1 118 21
of 1 118 21
the 1 118 21
Deal 1 118 21
Trump 1 118 21
sent 1 118 21
out 1 118 21
those 1 118 21
two 1 118 21
tweets, 1 118 21
he 1 118 21
was 1 118 21
sending 1 118 21
a 1 118 21
message 1 118 21
to 1 118 21
the 1 118 21
CIA 1 118 21

I 1 118 21
will 1 118 21

In 0 118 22
the 0 118 22

both 0 118 22
Trump 0 118 22
and 0 118 22
the 0 118 22
CIA 0 118 22

In 0 118 24
the 0 118 24
end, 0 118 24
the 0 118 24
CIA 0 118 24
blinked, 0 118 24
just 0 118 24
as 0 118 24
Trump 0 118 24
knew 0 118 24
it 0 118 24
would. 0 118 24

Contrary 0 118 25
to 0 118 25
what 0 118 25
the 0 118 25
mainstream 0 118 25
press 0 118 25
is 0 118 25
asserting, 0 118 25
the 1 118 25
records 1 118 25
undoubtedly 1 118 25
contain 1 118 25
more 1 118 25
incriminating 1 118 25
circumstantial 1 118 25
evidence 1 118 25
that 1 118 25
fills 1 118 25
in 1 118 25
the 1 118 25
mosaic 1 118 25
of 1 118 25
a 1 118 25
U.S. 1 118 25

operation 1 118 25
on 1 118 25
November 1 118 25
22, 1 118 25
1963. 1 118 25

That’s 0 118 26
what 0 118 26
the 0 118 26
mainstream 0 118 26
media, 0 118 26
forever 0 118 26
wedded 0 118 26
to 0 118 26
the 0 118 26
official 0 118 26
story 0 118 26
no 0 118 26
matter 0 118 26
how 0 118 26
ridiculous 1 118 26
and 1 118 26
illogical 1 118 26
it 0 118 26
is, 0 118 26
simply 0 118 26
cannot 0 118 26
bring 0 118 26
themselves 0 118 26
to 0 118 26
confront. 0 118 26

Trump 0 118 27
knew 0 118 27
that 0 118 27
he 0 118 27
had 0 118 27
the 0 118 27
CIA 0 118 27
over 0 118 27
a 0 118 27
barrel. 0 118 27

As 0 118 28
I 0 118 28
indicated 0 118 28
in 0 118 28
my 0 118 28
two 0 118 28
articles 0 118 28
this 0 118 28
week, 0 118 28
the 0 118 28
CIA 0 118 28
was 0 118 28
between 0 118 28
a 0 118 28
rock 0 118 28
and 0 118 28
a 0 118 28
hard 0 118 28
place. 0 118 28

On 0 118 29
the 0 118 29
one 0 118 29
hand, 0 118 29
it 0 118 29
could 0 118 29
refuse 0 118 29
to 0 118 29
grant 0 118 29
Trump 0 118 29
what 0 118 29
he 0 118 29
wanted 0 118 29
and 0 118 29
let 0 118 29
the 0 118 29
records 0 118 29
be 0 118 29
released, 0 118 29
which 0 118 29
it 1 118 29
knew 1 118 29
would 1 118 29
point 1 118 29
to 1 118 29
the 1 118 29
CIA’s 1 118 29
guilt 1 118 29
in 1 118 29
the 1 118 29
assassination. 1 118 29

On 0 118 30
the 0 118 30
other 0 118 30
hand, 0 118 30
it 0 118 30
could 0 118 30
give 0 118 30
Trump 0 118 30
what 0 118 30
he 0 118 30
wanted 0 118 30
and 0 118 30
have 0 118 30
to 0 118 30
suffer 0 118 30
the 1 118 30
obvious 1 118 30
inference 1 118 30
that 1 118 30
people 1 118 30
would 1 118 30
draw 1 118 30
— 1 118 30
that 1 118 30
the 1 118 30
CIA 1 118 30
was 1 118 30
continuing 1 118 30
to 1 118 30
cover 1 118 30
up 1 118 30
incriminatory 1 118 30
evidence. 1 118 30

What 0 118 31
did 0 118 31
the 0 118 31
CIA 0 118 31
give 0 118 31
Trump 0 118 31
in 0 118 31
return 0 118 31
for 0 118 31
Trump’s 0 118 31
extending 0 118 31
the 0 118 31
CIA’s 0 118 31
50-year-plus 0 118 31
secrecy? 0 118 31

We 0 118 32
don’t 0 118 32
know, 0 118 32
but 0 118 32
my 0 118 32
hunch 0 118 32
is 0 118 32
that 0 118 32
it 0 118 32
pertains 0 118 32
to 0 118 32
Russia. 0 118 32

Here’s 0 118 33
my 0 118 33
next 0 118 33
prediction: 0 118 33
the 0 118 33
congressional 0 118 33
investigations 0 118 33
into 0 118 33
Trump’s 0 118 33
supposed 0 118 33
“collusion” 0 118 33
with 0 118 33
Russia 0 118 33
are 0 118 33
about 0 118 33
to 0 118 33
fizzle 0 118 33
out. 0 118 33

That’s 0 118 34
because 0 118 34
I 0 118 34
believe 0 118 34
that 0 118 34
the 0 118 34
CIA, 0 118 34
as 0 118 34
part 0 118 34
of 0 118 34
its 0 118 34
deal 0 118 34
with 0 118 34
Trump, 0 118 34
will 0 118 34
order 0 118 34
its 0 118 34
assets 0 118 34
in 0 118 34
Congress 0 118 34
to 0 118 34
cease 0 118 34
and 0 118 34
desist 0 118 34
with 0 118 34
respect 0 118 34
to 0 118 34
that 0 118 34
investigation. 0 118 34

In 0 118 35
my 0 118 35
opinion, 0 118 35
that’s 0 118 35
the 0 118 35
price 0 118 35
the 0 118 35
CIA 0 118 35
had 0 118 35
to 0 118 35
pay 0 118 35
in 0 118 35
return 0 118 35
for 0 118 35
its 0 118 35
continued 0 118 35
cover-up 0 118 35
of 0 118 35
its 0 118 35
U.S. 0 118 35
regime-change 0 118 35
operation 0 118 35
in 0 118 35
November 0 118 35
1963. 0 118 35

Notice 0 118 36
something 0 118 36
else 0 118 36
about 0 118 36
the 0 118 36
deal 0 118 36
that 0 118 36
Trump 0 118 36
has 0 118 36
presumably 0 118 36
made 0 118 36
with 0 118 36
the 0 118 36
CIA: 0 118 36
The 0 118 36
secrecy 0 118 36
arrangement 0 118 36
extends 0 118 36
only 0 118 36
to 0 118 36
April. 0 118 36

Ostensibly, 0 118 37
the 0 118 37
next 0 118 37
six 0 118 37
months 0 118 37
are 0 118 37
needed 0 118 37
to 0 118 37
carefully 0 118 37
review 0 118 37
the 0 118 37
records 0 118 37
to 0 118 37
determine 0 118 37
whether 0 118 37
the 0 118 37
records 0 118 37
really 0 118 37
to 0 118 37
relate 0 118 37
to 0 118 37
“national 0 118 37
security.” 0 118 37
Regime 0 118 37
Change: 0 118 37

Hornberger 0 118 37
Check 0 118 37
Amazon 0 118 37
for 0 118 37
Pricing. 0 118 37

Not 0 118 38
surprisingly, 0 118 38
the 0 118 38
mainstream 0 118 38
media 0 118 38
isn’t 1 118 38
even 1 118 38
questioning 1 118 38
that 1 118 38
ludicrous 1 118 38
notion. 1 118 38

For 0 118 39
more 0 118 39
than 0 118 39
50 0 118 39
years, 0 118 39
the 0 118 39
CIA 0 118 39
has 0 118 39
known 0 118 39
why 0 118 39
it 0 118 39
has 0 118 39
wanted 0 118 39
those 0 118 39
particular 0 118 39
records 0 118 39
to 0 118 39
be 0 118 39
kept 0 118 39
secret. 0 118 39

During 0 118 40
the 0 118 40
term 0 118 40
of 0 118 40
the 0 118 40
Assassination 0 118 40
Records 0 118 40
Review 0 118 40
Board 0 118 40
in 0 118 40
the 0 118 40
1990s, 0 118 40
the 0 118 40
CIA 0 118 40
decided 0 118 40
to 0 118 40
keep 0 118 40
these 0 118 40
particular 0 118 40
records 0 118 40
secret 0 118 40
for 0 118 40
another 0 118 40
25 0 118 40
years. 0 118 40

There 0 118 41
are 0 118 41
bound 0 118 41
to 0 118 41
be 0 118 41
lots 0 118 41
of 0 118 41
CIA 0 118 41
memoranda 0 118 41
detailing 0 118 41
why 0 118 41
it 0 118 41
was 0 118 41
imperative 0 118 41
to 0 118 41
keep 0 118 41
these 0 118 41
particular 0 118 41
records 0 118 41
secret 0 118 41
for 0 118 41
as 0 118 41
long 0 118 41
as 0 118 41
possible. 0 118 41

Finally, 0 118 42
the 0 118 42
CIA 0 118 42
made 0 118 42
its 0 118 42
request 0 118 42
for 0 118 42
secrecy 0 118 42
to 0 118 42
Trump 0 118 42
at 0 118 42
least 0 118 42
several 0 118 42
weeks 0 118 42
ago. 0 118 42

The 0 118 43
notion 0 118 43
that 0 118 43
the 0 118 43
CIA 0 118 43
suddenly 0 118 43
hit 0 118 43
Trump 0 118 43
yesterday 0 118 43
with 0 118 43
a 0 118 43
new 0 118 43
argument 0 118 43
as 0 118 43
to 0 118 43
why 0 118 43
“national 0 118 43
security” 0 118 43
would 0 118 43
be 0 118 43
threatened, 0 118 43
after 0 118 43
Trump 0 118 43
had 0 118 43
supposedly 0 118 43
already 0 118 43
rejected 0 118 43
the 0 118 43
arguments 0 118 43
that 0 118 43
had 0 118 43
been 0 118 43
presented 0 118 43
to 0 118 43
him, 0 118 43
causing 0 118 43
Trump 0 118 43
to 0 118 43
suddenly 0 118 43
change 0 118 43
his 0 118 43
mind, 0 118 43
is, 1 118 43
well, 1 118 43
laughable. 1 118 43

So, 0 118 44
why 0 118 44
the 0 118 44
April 0 118 44
deadline? 0 118 44

Why 0 118 45
not 0 118 45
extend 0 118 45
the 0 118 45
secrecy 0 118 45
for 0 118 45
another 0 118 45
25 0 118 45
years, 0 118 45
which 0 118 45
is 0 118 45
undoubtedly 0 118 45
what 0 118 45
the 0 118 45
CIA 0 118 45
wanted? 0 118 45

Because 0 118 46
Trump 0 118 46
obviously 0 118 46
needed 0 118 46
collateral 0 118 46
to 0 118 46
ensure 0 118 46
that 0 118 46
the 0 118 46
CIA 0 118 46
complied 0 118 46
with 0 118 46
its 0 118 46
part 0 118 46
of 0 118 46
the 0 118 46
deal. 0 118 46

If 0 118 47
Trump 0 118 47
had 0 118 47
extended 0 118 47
the 0 118 47
secrecy 0 118 47
for 0 118 47
25 0 118 47
years, 0 118 47
he 0 118 47
would 0 118 47
have 0 118 47
lost 0 118 47
leverage 0 118 47
to 0 118 47
ensure 0 118 47
that 0 118 47
the 0 118 47
CIA 0 118 47
complied 0 118 47
with 0 118 47
its 0 118 47
part 0 118 47
of 0 118 47
the 0 118 47
bargain. 0 118 47

Let’s 0 118 48
say, 0 118 48
hypothetically, 0 118 48
that 0 118 48
I’m 0 118 48
right: 0 118 48
that 0 118 48
the 0 118 48
CIA 0 118 48
agreed 0 118 48
to 0 118 48
use 0 118 48
its 0 118 48
assets 0 118 48
in 0 118 48
Congress 0 118 48
to 0 118 48
shut 0 118 48
down 0 118 48
the 0 118 48
Russia 0 118 48
investigation. 0 118 48

To 0 118 49
make 0 118 49
certain 0 118 49
that 0 118 49
the 0 118 49
CIA 0 118 49
fulfills 0 118 49
its 0 118 49
part 0 118 49
of 0 118 49
the 0 118 49
bargain, 0 118 49
Trump 0 118 49
would 0 118 49
need 0 118 49
the 0 118 49
April 0 118 49
deadline 0 118 49
so 0 118 49
that 0 118 49
the 0 118 49
threat 0 118 49
of 0 118 49
the 0 118 49
records 0 118 49
release 0 118 49
would 0 118 49
continue 0 118 49
hanging 0 118 49
over 0 118 49
the 0 118 49
CIA. 0 118 49

If 0 118 50
the 0 118 50
CIA 0 118 50
fails 0 118 50
to 0 118 50
fulfill 0 118 50
its 0 118 50
part 0 118 50
of 0 118 50
the 0 118 50
bargain, 0 118 50
Trump 0 118 50
releases 0 118 50
the 0 118 50
records 0 118 50
in 0 118 50
April. 0 118 50

If 0 118 51
the 0 118 51
CIA 0 118 51
squelches 0 118 51
the 0 118 51
Russia 0 118 51
investigations, 0 118 51
Trump 0 118 51
grants 0 118 51
another 0 118 51
extension 0 118 51
of 0 118 51
time 0 118 51
in 0 118 51

upon 0 118 56
the 0 118 56
arrest 0 118 56
of 0 118 56
Lee 0 118 56

the 0 118 56
official 0 118 56

that 0 118 56
this 0 118 56
was 0 118 56
just 0 118 56
a 1 118 56

former 1 118 56

apparent 0 118 56
reason, 0 118 56
to 0 118 56

One 0 118 57
big 0 118 57
problem 0 118 57
is 0 118 57
the 0 118 57
official 0 118 57
story, 0 118 57
however, 0 118 57
requires 0 118 57
a 0 118 57
suspension 1 118 57
of 1 118 57
logic 1 118 57
and 1 118 57
common 1 118 57
sense. 1 118 57

For 0 118 58
anyone 0 118 58
who 0 118 58
has 0 118 58
a 0 118 58
mindset 0 118 58
of 0 118 58
conformity 0 118 58
and 0 118 58
deference 0 118 58
to 0 118 58
authority, 0 118 58
that 0 118 58
story 0 118 58
makes 0 118 58
sense 0 118 58
because 0 118 58
nothing 0 118 58
is 0 118 58
questioned 0 118 58
or 0 118 58
challenged. 0 118 58

For 1 118 59
anyone 1 118 59
who 1 118 59
has 1 118 59
a 1 118 59
critical, 1 118 59
analytical, 1 118 59
independent 1 118 59
mindset, 1 118 59
the 1 118 59
official 1 118 59
story 1 118 59
is 1 118 59
filled 1 118 59
with 1 118 59
holes. 1 118 59

For 0 118 60
example, 0 118 60
how 0 118 60
many 0 118 60

have 0 118 60
you 0 118 60

Why 0 118 61
would 0 118 61
a 0 118 61
genuine 0 118 61

join 0 118 61
the 0 118 61

in 0 118 61
the 0 118 61
first 0 118 61
place, 0 118 61
especially 0 118 61
since 0 118 61
the 0 118 61
Marines 0 118 61
had 0 118 61
just 0 118 61
recently 0 118 61
killed 0 118 61
millions 0 118 61
of 0 118 61
North 0 118 61

Why 0 118 62
would 0 118 62
a 0 118 62
genuine 0 118 62
communist 0 118 62
join 0 118 62
the 0 118 62
Marines 0 118 62
knowing 0 118 62
that 0 118 62
he 0 118 62
could 0 118 62
be 0 118 62
called 0 118 62
upon 0 118 62
at 0 118 62
any 0 118 62
moment 0 118 62
to 0 118 62

Korea, 0 118 62
Laos, 0 118 62
Vietnam, 0 118 62
Europe, 0 118 62
or 0 118 62
elsewhere 0 118 62
to 0 118 62
kill 0 118 62
fellow 0 118 62
communists? 0 118 62

How 0 118 63
many 0 118 63

do 0 118 63
you 0 118 63
know 0 118 63

skewers 1 118 69
them. 1 118 69

Why, 0 118 70
just 0 118 70
look 0 118 70
at 0 118 70
how 0 118 70
they 1 118 70

Soon 0 118 76
after 0 118 76
the 0 118 76
Warren 0 118 76
Commission 0 118 76
was 0 118 76
established, 0 118 76
Warren 0 118 76
called 0 118 76
a 0 118 76
super-secret 0 118 76
meeting 0 118 76
of 0 118 76
the 0 118 76

to 0 118 76
address 0 118 76
information 0 118 76
that 0 118 76
had 0 118 76
come 0 118 76
into 0 118 76
Warren’s 0 118 76
possession. 0 118 76

That 0 118 77
information 0 118 77
was 0 118 77
that 0 118 77
Oswald 0 118 77
was 0 118 77
actually 0 118 77
working 0 118 77
for 0 118 77
U.S. 0 118 77
intelligence. 0 118 77

Yes, 0 118 78
a 0 118 78
spy, 0 118 78
the 0 118 78
type 0 118 78
of 0 118 78
people 0 118 78
that 0 118 78
work 0 118 78
for 0 118 78
the 0 118 78
CIA. 0 118 78

That 0 118 79
would 0 118 79
make 0 118 79
sense, 0 118 79
especially 0 118 79
given 0 118 79
that 0 118 79
the 0 118 79
Marine 0 118 79

is 0 118 79
a 0 118 79

Semper 0 118 80
fidelis! 0 118 80

Now, 0 118 81
suddenly, 0 118 81
all 0 118 81
the 0 118 81
circumstantial 0 118 81
evidence 0 118 81
in 0 118 81
the 0 118 81
Kennedy 0 118 81

falls 0 118 81
into 0 118 81
place. 0 118 81

It 0 118 82
begins 0 118 82
to 0 118 82
make 0 118 82
sense. 0 118 82

The 0 118 83
mosaic 0 118 83
starts 0 118 83
to 0 118 83
be 0 118 83
filled 0 118 83
out: 0 118 83

But 0 118 86
to 0 118 86
avoid 0 118 86
detection, 0 118 86
they 0 118 86
needed 0 118 86
a 0 118 86
patsy, 0 118 86
which 0 118 86
is 0 118 86
the 0 118 86
term 0 118 86
that 0 118 86
Oswald 0 118 86
used 0 118 86
after 0 118 86
his 0 118 86
arrest. 0 118 86

They 0 118 87
needed 0 118 87
to 0 118 87
frame 0 118 87
someone 0 118 87
for 0 118 87
the 0 118 87
crime. 0 118 87

And 0 118 88
what 0 118 88
better 0 118 88
person 0 118 88
to 0 118 88
frame 0 118 88
than 0 118 88
a 0 118 88
communist 0 118 88
or 0 118 88
an 0 118 88
intelligence 0 118 88
agent 0 118 88
who 0 118 88
the 0 118 88
public 0 118 88
would 0 118 88
believe 0 118 88
was 0 118 88
a 0 118 88
communist? 0 118 88

Part 0 118 89
of 0 118 89
the 0 118 89
scheme, 0 118 89
obviously, 0 118 89
would 0 118 89
be 0 118 89
to 0 118 89
establish 0 118 89
Oswald’s 0 118 89
communist 0 118 89
bona 0 118 89
fides. 0 118 89

That’s 0 118 90
why 0 118 90
he 0 118 90
was 0 118 90
sent 0 118 90
to 0 118 90
New 0 118 90
Orleans, 0 118 90
where, 0 118 90
contradictorily, 0 118 90
he 0 118 90
would 0 118 90
work 0 118 90
for 0 118 90
a 0 118 90
right-wing 0 118 90
business 0 118 90
owner, 0 118 90
work 0 118 90
with 0 118 90
a 0 118 90
right-wing 0 118 90
former 0 118 90
FBI 0 118 90
agent, 0 118 90
and 0 118 90
conduct 0 118 90
a 0 118 90
public 0 118 90
protest 0 118 90
in 0 118 90
favor 0 118 90
of 0 118 90
Fidel 0 118 90
Castro 0 118 90
and 0 118 90
Cuba. 0 118 90

It 0 118 91
was 0 118 91
also 0 118 91
why 0 118 91
he 0 118 91
was 0 118 91
sent 0 118 91
to 0 118 91
Mexico 0 118 91
City, 0 118 91
where 0 118 91
he 0 118 91
would 0 118 91
be 0 118 91
ordered 0 118 91
to 0 118 91
visit 0 118 91
the 0 118 91
Cuban 0 118 91
and 0 118 91
Soviet 0 118 91
Embassies, 0 118 91
no 1 118 91
doubt 1 118 91
being 1 118 91
told 1 118 91
that 1 118 91
he 1 118 91
was 1 118 91
being 1 118 91
prepared 1 118 91
for 1 118 91
an 1 118 91
important 1 118 91
mission, 1 118 91
maybe 0 118 91
to 0 118 91
enter 0 118 91
Cuba 0 118 91
to 0 118 91
assassinate 0 118 91
Castro. 0 118 91

But 0 118 92
no 1 118 92
government 1 118 92
operation 1 118 92
ever 1 118 92
goes 1 118 92
perfectly. 1 118 92

Things 0 118 93
obviously 0 118 93
went 0 118 93
dreadfully 1 118 93
wrong 1 118 93
with 0 118 93
the 0 118 93
Mexico 0 118 93
City 0 118 93
operation 0 118 93
because 0 118 93
the 0 118 93
investigation 0 118 93
into 0 118 93
it 0 118 93
after 0 118 93
the 0 118 93
assassination 0 118 93
was 0 118 93
quickly 0 118 93
shut 0 118 93
down. 0 118 93

Today, 0 118 94
it 0 118 94
remains 0 118 94
shrouded 1 118 94
in 1 118 94
mystery. 1 118 94

And 0 118 95
guess 0 118 95
what 0 118 95
is 0 118 95
included 0 118 95
in 0 118 95
the 0 118 95
records 0 118 95
that 0 118 95
Trump 0 118 95
has 0 118 95
now 0 118 95
agreed 0 118 95
to 0 118 95
continue 0 118 95
suppressing. 0 118 95

You 0 118 96
guessed 0 118 96
it! 0 118 96

The 0 118 97
CIA’s 0 118 97
records 0 118 97
relating 0 118 97
to 0 118 97
Mexico 0 118 97
City! 0 118 97

Ever 0 118 98
since 0 118 98
the 0 118 98
assassination, 0 118 98
the 1 118 98
CIA 1 118 98
has 1 118 98
argued 1 118 98
that 1 118 98
the 1 118 98
release 1 118 98
of 1 118 98
any 1 118 98
of 1 118 98
its 1 118 98
JFK 1 118 98
records 1 118 98
would 1 118 98
threaten 1 118 98
“national 1 118 98
security.” 1 118 98
One 0 118 98
thing 0 118 98
is 0 118 98
for 0 118 98
sure 0 118 98
and 0 118 98
undeniable: 0 118 98
Despite 0 118 98
the 0 118 98
release 0 118 98
of 0 118 98
many 0 118 98
of 0 118 98
the 0 118 98
CIA’s 0 118 98
records 0 118 98
in 0 118 98
the 0 118 98
1990s 0 118 98
and 0 118 98
yesterday, 0 118 98
the 1 118 98
United 1 118 98
States 1 118 98
did 1 118 98
not 1 118 98
fall 1 118 98

the 1 118 98
ocean 1 118 98
or 1 118 98
fall 1 118 98
to 1 118 98
the 1 118 98
communists. 1 118 98

And 0 118 99
neither 0 118 99
would 0 118 99
it 0 118 99
have 0 118 99
done 0 118 99
so 0 118 99
if 0 118 99

cooperate 0 127 5
with 0 127 5
a 0 127 5
federal 0 127 5

he 0 127 5
is 0 127 5

But 0 127 6
Trump 0 127 6
on 0 127 6
Monday 0 127 6
morning 0 127 6
tweeted 0 127 6
that 0 127 6
McGahn 0 127 6
spoke 0 127 6
with 0 127 6
the 0 127 6
special 0 127 6

for 0 127 6
“over 0 127 6

(The 1 127 6

The 0 127 7
length 0 127 7
of 0 127 7
the 0 127 7
Mueller-McGahn 0 127 7
sessions 0 127 7
led 0 127 7
Trump 0 127 7
to 0 127 7
the 0 127 7
conclusion 0 127 7
the 0 127 7
special 0 127 7
counsel 0 127 7
is 0 127 7
“looking 1 127 7
for 1 127 7
trouble” 1 127 7
because 0 127 7
they 0 127 7
“they 1 127 7

But 0 127 8
Mueller 0 127 8
reportedly 0 127 8
is 0 127 8
keenly 0 127 8
interested 0 127 8

by 0 127 8
Donald 0 127 8

Jr., 0 127 8
which 0 127 8
included 0 127 8
a 0 127 8
Russian 0 127 8
attorney 0 127 8

The 0 127 9

also 0 127 9
was 0 127 9

by 0 127 9

son-in-law 0 127 9
Jared 0 127 9
Kushner; 0 127 9
the 1 127 9
president 1 127 9
dictated 1 127 9
a 1 127 9
misleading 1 127 9
statement 1 127 9
about 1 127 9
it 1 127 9
a 1 127 9
year 1 127 9
later 1 127 9
and 1 127 9
it 1 127 9
remains 1 127 9
murky 1 127 9
just 1 127 9
when 1 127 9
he 1 127 9
learned 1 127 9
about 1 127 9
the 1 127 9
meeting. 1 127 9

As 0 127 10
Roll 0 127 10
Call 0 127 10
has 0 127 10
reported, 0 127 10
Trump 0 127 10
was 0 127 10
in 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
tower 0 127 10
at 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
time 0 127 10
of 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
session 0 127 10
with 0 127 10
the 0 127 10
Russian 0 127 10
lawyer. 0 127 10

The 0 127 11
president 0 127 11
also 0 127 11
continued 0 127 11
to 0 127 11
push 0 127 11
a 0 127 11
line 0 127 11
first 1 127 11
floated 1 127 11
by 0 127 11
his 0 127 11
attorney, 0 127 11
former 0 127 11
New 0 127 11
York 0 127 11
mayor 0 127 11
and 0 127 11
U.S. 0 127 11
attorney 0 127 11
Rudolph 0 127 11
Giuliani, 0 127 11
tweeting 0 127 11
that 0 127 11
campaign 0 127 11
collusion 0 127 11
with 0 127 11
Russia 0 127 11
would 0 127 11
be 0 127 11
a 1 127 11
“phony 1 127 11
crime.” 1 127 11
He’s 0 127 11
right, 0 127 11
there 0 127 11
is 0 127 11
no 0 127 11
specific 0 127 11
collusion 0 127 11
statute. 0 127 11

But 1 127 12
legal 1 127 12
experts 1 127 12
say 1 127 12
anyone 1 127 12
in 1 127 12
Trump’s 1 127 12
orbit 1 127 12
would 1 127 12
be 1 127 12
charged 1 127 12
with 1 127 12
conspiracy, 1 127 12
making 1 127 12
false 1 127 12
statements 1 127 12

federal 1 127 12
investigators 1 127 12
or 1 127 12
obstructing 1 127 12
justice. 1 127 12

All 1 127 13
are 1 127 13
federal 1 127 13
crimes. 1 127 13

Trump 1 127 14
also 1 127 14
continued 1 127 14
to 1 127 14
cast 1 127 14
himself 1 127 14
as 1 127 14
a 1 127 14
victim 1 127 14
in 1 127 14
the 1 127 14
matter, 1 127 14
saying 1 127 14
when 1 127 14
he 1 127 14
attempts 1 127 14
to 1 127 14
“FIGHT 1 127 14
BACK 1 127 14
or 1 127 14
say 1 127 14
anything 1 127 14
bad 1 127 14
about 1 127 14
the 1 127 14

Hunt,” 1 127 14
his 1 127 14
critics 1 127 14
“scream 1 127 14
Obstruction!” 1 127 14

Mueller 0 127 15
also 0 127 15

not 0 128 26
only 0 128 26
claimed 0 128 26
the 0 128 26
women 0 128 26
were 0 128 26
lying 0 128 26
but 0 128 26
then 0 128 26
fled 0 128 26
the 0 128 26
scene. 0 128 26

At 0 128 27
least 0 128 27
he 0 128 27
said 0 128 27
something 0 128 27
there, 0 128 27
which 0 128 27
is 0 128 27
more 0 128 27
than 0 128 27

for 0 128 27
his 0 128 27

Failing 0 128 28
to 0 128 28
answer, 0 128 28
Ellison 0 128 28
tried 0 128 28
to 0 128 28
move 0 128 28
from 0 128 28
person 0 128 28
to 0 128 28

allowing 0 128 28
his 0 128 28

to 0 128 28
try 0 128 28
and 0 128 28
provide 0 128 28
cover 0 128 28
for 0 128 28
him, 0 128 28
similar 0 128 28
to 0 128 28
that 0 128 28
of 0 128 28
Maxine 0 128 28

Finally, 0 128 29

fled 0 128 29

simply 0 128 35
omitted 0 128 35
it 0 128 35

presented 0 128 35
himself 0 128 35

This 0 128 36
past 0 128 36

told 0 128 36
Jake 0 128 36

on 0 128 36

“I 0 128 36

it.” 0 128 37

that 0 128 37
wasn’t 0 128 37
it. 0 128 37

first 0 128 38

extraordinarily 1 128 41
poor 1 128 41

Among 0 128 42

In 0 128 43

Minneapolis 0 128 43
police 0 128 43
officer 0 128 43

Police 0 128 44
later 0 128 44
determined 0 128 44
that 0 128 44

murder 0 128 44
was 0 128 44

four 0 128 45

members 0 128 45
who 0 128 45
murdered 0 128 45

met 0 128 45
and 0 128 45
planned 0 128 45
the 0 128 45
murder 0 128 45
at 0 128 45
Willis’s 0 128 45
house. 0 128 45

the 0 128 46
fact 0 128 46
that 0 128 46
two 0 128 46

in 0 128 46

to 0 128 46

At 0 128 47
the 0 128 47

reasons 0 136 13
that 0 136 13

those 0 136 13

dissatisfaction 0 136 13
with 0 136 13

academic 0 136 13
curriculum, 0 136 13

worries 0 136 13
about 0 136 13
the 0 136 13
school 0 136 13
environment. 0 136 13

Since 0 136 14

often 0 136 14
perpetrated 0 136 14
at 0 136 14
schools 0 136 14
simply 0 136 14
because 0 136 14
they 0 136 14
are 0 136 14
gun 0 136 14
free 0 136 14
zones, 0 136 14
homeschooling 0 136 14
takes 0 136 14
care 0 136 14
of 0 136 14
that 0 136 14
problem. 0 136 14

“Most 0 136 15

more 0 136 15
than 0 136 15

reason,” 0 136 15
Ray 0 136 15
told 0 136 15
the 0 136 15

“But 0 136 16
when 0 136 16
we 0 136 16
ask 0 136 16

why 0 136 16
do 0 136 16
they 0 136 16
homeschool, 0 136 16
near 0 136 16
the 0 136 16

of 0 136 17
that.” 0 136 17

Indoctrination 1 136 18
means 0 136 18
to 0 136 18

It’s 1 136 19
the 1 136 19

critically 0 136 20
understand 0 136 20
that 0 136 20

people 0 136 20
and 0 136 20
taking 0 136 20
their 0 136 20

is 0 136 20
wrong 0 136 20

even 0 136 20
if 0 136 20
people 0 136 20
who 0 136 20
declare 0 136 20
themselves 0 136 20
government 0 136 20
is 0 136 20
the 0 136 20
one 0 136 20
doing 0 136 20
it. 0 136 20

Governments 1 136 21
are 1 136 21
nothing 1 136 21
more 1 136 21
than 1 136 21
a 1 136 21
handful 1 136 21
of 1 136 21
people 1 136 21
and 0 136 21
have 0 136 21

right 0 136 21
to 0 136 21
aggress 0 136 21

Steinle, 0 139 4

was 0 139 4
fatally 0 139 4
shot 0 139 4
while 0 139 4
she 0 139 4
walked 0 139 4
along 0 139 4
Pier 0 139 4

The 0 139 5

pierced 0 139 5
her 0 139 5

ricocheted 0 139 5
off 0 139 5
the 0 139 5
concrete 0 139 5
ground 0 139 5
after 0 139 5
it 0 139 5
was 0 139 5
fired 0 139 5
by 0 139 5
Garcia 0 139 5
Zarate 0 139 5
from 0 139 5
a 0 139 5

belonging 0 139 5
to 0 139 5
a 0 139 5
federal 0 139 5

four 0 139 5

earlier. 0 139 5

Garcia 0 139 6
Zarate's 0 139 6
defense 0 139 6
attorneys 0 139 6
argued 0 139 6
that 0 139 6
the 0 139 6
shooting 0 139 6
was 0 139 6
an 0 139 6
accident 0 139 6
— 0 139 6
they 0 139 6
said 0 139 6
he 0 139 6
found 0 139 6
the 0 139 6
gun 0 139 6
wrapped 0 139 6

and 0 139 6
unintentionally 0 139 6
discharged 0 139 6
it. 0 139 6

Lead 0 139 7
attorney 0 139 7
Matt 0 139 7
Gonzalez 0 139 7
has 0 139 7
argued 0 139 7
that 0 139 7
the 0 139 7
weapon 0 139 7
was 0 139 7
a 0 139 7
SIG 0 139 7

with 0 139 7
a 0 139 7
"hair 1 139 7

— 0 139 7
a 0 139 7
model 0 139 7
well-known 0 139 7
for 0 139 7
accidental 0 139 7
discharges 0 139 7
even 0 139 7
among 0 139 7
experienced 0 139 7
shooters. 0 139 7

Gonzalez 0 139 8
told 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
jury, 0 139 8
according 0 139 8
to 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
San 0 139 8
Francisco 0 139 8
Chronicle, 0 139 8
that 0 139 8
Garcia 0 139 8
Zarate 0 139 8
had 0 139 8
never 0 139 8
handled 0 139 8
a 0 139 8
firearm 0 139 8
before, 0 139 8
was 0 139 8
frightened 0 139 8
by 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
noise 0 139 8
of 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
gunshot, 0 139 8
then 0 139 8
flung 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
weapon 0 139 8
into 0 139 8
the 0 139 8
bay 0 139 8
where 0 139 8
it 0 139 8
was 0 139 8
later 0 139 8
found 0 139 8
by 0 139 8
a 0 139 8
diver. 0 139 8

Prosecutors, 0 139 9
however, 0 139 9
alleged 0 139 9
that 0 139 9
Garcia 0 139 9
Zarate 0 139 9
brought 0 139 9
the 0 139 9
weapon 0 139 9
to 0 139 9
the 0 139 9
pier 0 139 9
deliberately 0 139 9
to 0 139 9
do 0 139 9
harm, 0 139 9
and 0 139 9
intentionally 0 139 9
aimed 0 139 9
and 0 139 9
shot 0 139 9
Steinle 0 139 9
after 0 139 9
firmly 0 139 9
pulling 0 139 9
the 0 139 9
trigger. 0 139 9

They 0 139 10
said 0 139 10
Garcia 0 139 10
Zarate 0 139 10
then 0 139 10
threw 0 139 10
the 0 139 10
weapon 0 139 10
into 0 139 10
the 0 139 10
bay 0 139 10
and 0 139 10
fled 0 139 10
the 0 139 10
scene. 0 139 10

Beyond 0 139 11
the 0 139 11
shooting 0 139 11
itself, 0 139 11
perhaps 0 139 11
the 0 139 11
most 0 139 11
controversial 0 139 11
aspect 0 139 11
of 0 139 11
Garcia 0 139 11
Zarate's 0 139 11
case 0 139 11
involves 0 139 11
his 0 139 11
previous 0 139 11
criminal 0 139 11
activity 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
history 0 139 11
of 0 139 11
deportations, 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
how 0 139 11
San 0 139 11
Francisco 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
federal 0 139 11
authorities 0 139 11
handled 0 139 11
his 0 139 11
custody 0 139 11
before 0 139 11
he 0 139 11
ever 0 139 11
picked 0 139 11
up 0 139 11
the 0 139 11
gun 0 139 11
and 0 139 11
shot 0 139 11
Steinle. 0 139 11

At 0 139 12
the 0 139 12
time 0 139 12
of 0 139 12
Steinle's 0 139 12
death, 0 139 12
Garcia 0 139 12
Zarate 0 139 12
had 0 139 12
been 0 139 12
convicted 0 139 12
of 0 139 12
nonviolent 0 139 12
drug 0 139 12

the 0 139 12
early 0 139 12
1990s. 0 139 12

He 0 139 13

Due 0 139 15
to 0 139 15
San 0 139 15
Francisco's 0 139 15
policy 0 139 15
of 0 139 15

As 0 139 16
a 0 139 16
result 0 139 16
of 0 139 16
the 0 139 16
case, 0 139 16
both 0 139 16

the 0 139 16
city 0 139 16
of 0 139 16
San 0 139 16
Francisco 0 139 16
have 0 139 16
changed 0 139 16
several 0 139 16
policies. 0 139 16

The 0 139 17
DOJ 0 139 17
announced 0 139 17
in 0 139 17
2016 0 139 17
it 0 139 17
would 0 139 17
no 0 139 17
longer 0 139 17
release 0 139 17
potentially 0 139 17
deportable 0 139 17

allowing 0 139 17
ICE 0 139 17
to 0 139 17
take 0 139 17
custody. 0 139 17

San 0 139 18
Francisco, 0 139 18
meanwhile, 0 139 18
has 0 139 18
adjusted 0 139 18
its 0 139 18
policy 0 139 18
to 0 139 18
notify 0 139 18
ICE 0 139 18
if 0 139 18
they 0 139 18

"This 1 139 19
tragedy 1 139 19
could 1 139 19

if 1 139 19
San 1 139 19

of 1 139 19
releasing 1 139 19
him 1 139 19
back 1 139 19
onto 1 139 19

ICE 0 139 19
Director 0 139 19
Thomas 0 139 19
Homan 0 139 19
said 0 139 19
in 0 139 19
a 0 139 19
statement 0 139 19
on 0 139 19
Thursday. 0 139 19

"It 0 139 20
is 0 139 20
unconscionable 0 139 20
that 0 139 20
politicians 1 139 20
across 1 139 20
this 1 139 20
country 1 139 20
continue 1 139 20
to 1 139 20
endanger 1 139 20

inflicted 1 139 20
on 1 139 20
their 1 139 20
constituents." 1 139 20

But 0 139 21
ICE 0 139 21
has 0 139 21
faced 0 139 21
criticism 0 139 21
of 0 139 21
its 0 139 21
own 0 139 21
over 0 139 21
not 0 139 21
seeking 0 139 21
a 0 139 21

to 0 139 21

obtain 0 139 21
custody 0 139 21
of 0 139 21
Garcia 0 139 21
Zarate 0 139 21
when 0 139 21
it 0 139 21
discovered 0 139 21
he 0 139 21
had 0 139 21
been 0 139 21
transferred 0 139 21
into 0 139 21
San 0 139 21
Francisco's 0 139 21
custody. 0 139 21

The 0 139 22
agency 0 139 22
has 0 139 22
argued 0 139 22
that 0 139 22
obtaining 0 139 22
judicial 0 139 22
warrants 0 139 22
are 0 139 22
unnecessary 0 139 22
and 0 139 22
would 0 139 22
place 0 139 22
too 0 139 22
much 0 139 22
burden 0 139 22
on 0 139 22
ICE 0 139 22
officials 0 139 22
and 0 139 22

courts. 0 139 22

Though 0 139 23
the 0 139 23

did 0 139 23
issue 0 139 23
a 0 139 23
request 0 139 23
to 0 139 23
the 0 139 23
city 0 139 23
to 0 139 23
detain 0 139 23
Garcia 0 139 23
Zarate 0 139 23
until 0 139 23
ICE 0 139 23
officials 0 139 23
could 0 139 23
pick 0 139 23
him 0 139 23
up, 0 139 23
their 0 139 23
detainer 0 139 23
requests 0 139 23
are 0 139 23
not 0 139 23
signed 0 139 23
by 0 139 23
a 0 139 23

therefore 0 139 23
not 0 139 23
legally 0 139 23
binding. 0 139 23

San 0 139 24

cited 0 139 24

cases 0 139 24
concluding 0 139 24
that 0 139 24

Pontifical 0 143 3
Council 0 143 3
for 0 143 3
Legislative 0 143 3
Texts, 0 143 3
made 0 143 3
it 0 143 3
very 0 143 3
clear 0 143 3
to 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
Catholic 0 143 3
News 0 143 3
Service 0 143 3
on 0 143 3
December 0 143 3
5 0 143 3
what 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
Pope 0 143 3
is 0 143 3
up 0 143 3
to: 0 143 3
“The 0 143 3
fact 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
pope 0 143 3
requested 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
his 0 143 3
letter 0 143 3

the 0 143 3
interpretations 0 143 3
of 0 143 3

Buenos 0 143 3

be 0 143 3
published 0 143 3
in 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
AAS 0 143 3
means 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
His 0 143 3
Holiness 0 143 3
has 0 143 3
given 0 143 3
these 0 143 3
documents 0 143 3
a 0 143 3
particular 0 143 3
qualification 0 143 3
that 0 143 3
elevates 0 143 3
them 0 143 3
to 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
level 0 143 3
of 0 143 3
being 0 143 3
official 0 143 3
teachings 0 143 3
of 0 143 3
the 0 143 3
church. 0 143 3

While 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
content 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
pope’s 0 143 4
letter 0 143 4
itself 0 143 4
does 0 143 4
not 0 143 4
contain 0 143 4
teachings 0 143 4
on 0 143 4
faith 0 143 4
and 0 143 4
morals, 0 143 4
it 0 143 4
does 0 143 4
point 0 143 4
toward 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
interpretations 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
the 0 143 4
Argentine 0 143 4
bishops 0 143 4
and 0 143 4
confirms 0 143 4
them 0 143 4
as 0 143 4
authentically 0 143 4
reflecting 0 143 4
his 0 143 4
own 0 143 4
mind. 0 143 4

Thus 0 143 5
together 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
two 0 143 5
documents 0 143 5
became 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
Holy 0 143 5
Father’s 0 143 5
authentic 0 143 5
magisterium 0 143 5
for 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
whole 0 143 5
church.” 0 143 5

What 0 143 6
Cardinal 0 143 6
Burke 0 143 6
rightly 0 143 6
describes 0 143 6
as 0 143 6
lacking 1 143 6
in 1 143 6
any 1 143 6
magisterial 1 143 6
weight 1 143 6
whatsoever—and, 1 143 6
in 0 143 6
fact, 0 143 6
in 0 143 6
dire 0 143 6
need 0 143 6
of 0 143 6
clarification 0 143 6
and 0 143 6
correction— 0 143 6
has 0 143 6
by 0 143 6
papal 0 143 6
fiat 0 143 6
been 0 143 6
declared 0 143 6
magisterial, 0 143 6
and 0 143 6
thus 0 143 6
binding 0 143 6
on 0 143 6
us 0 143 6
all. 0 143 6

Francis 1 143 7
made 1 143 7
it 1 143 7
clear 1 143 7
that 1 143 7
the 1 143 7
Argentine 1 143 7
bishops’ 1 143 7
interpretation 1 143 7
of 1 143 7
AL 1 143 7
allowing 1 143 7
public 1 143 7
adulterers 1 143 7
to 1 143 7
receive 1 143 7
Holy 1 143 7
Communion 1 143 7
“explains 1 143 7
precisely 1 143 7
the 1 143 7
meaning 1 143 7
of 1 143 7
Chapter 1 143 7
VIII 1 143 7
of 1 143 7
‘Amoris 1 143 7
Laetitia.’ 1 143 7
There 1 143 7
are 1 143 7
no 1 143 7
other 1 143 7
interpretations.” 1 143 7

I 0 143 8
would 0 143 8
imagine 0 143 8
this 0 143 8
outrageous 1 143 8
overreach 1 143 8
of 1 143 8
papal 1 143 8
authority 1 143 8
on 0 143 8
the 0 143 8
Pope's 0 143 8
part 0 143 8
would 0 143 8
make 0 143 8
it 0 143 8
ominously 1 143 8
clear 1 143 8
to 0 143 8
Cardinal 0 143 8
Burke 0 143 8
that 0 143 8
the 0 143 8
time 0 143 8
has 0 143 8
come 0 143 8
to 0 143 8
issue 0 143 8
his 0 143 8
public 0 143 8
correction 0 143 8
of 0 143 8
Pope 0 143 8
Francis's 0 143 8
erroneous 0 143 8
teaching. 0 143 8

The 0 143 9
moment, 0 143 9
it 0 143 9
would 0 143 9
seem, 0 143 9
has 0 143 9
come. 0 143 9

Cardinal 0 143 10
Burke, 0 143 10
please 0 143 10
and 0 143 10

2012. 0 145 29

Before 0 145 30
Patel 0 145 30
signed 0 145 30
the 0 145 30
Army 0 145 30
application, 0 145 30
a 0 145 30
recruiter 0 145 30
asked 0 145 30
him 0 145 30
specifically 0 145 30
about 0 145 30
the 0 145 30
travel 0 145 30
question 0 145 30
and 0 145 30
reminded 0 145 30
him 0 145 30
providing 0 145 30
false 0 145 30
information 0 145 30
could 0 145 30
result 0 145 30
in 0 145 30
criminal 0 145 30
charges. 0 145 30

During 0 145 31
the 0 145 31
interview, 0 145 31
the 0 145 31
recruiter 0 145 31
asked 0 145 31
to 0 145 31
see 0 145 31
Patel's 0 145 31
passport 0 145 31
to 0 145 31
confirm 0 145 31
his 0 145 31
travel 0 145 31
claims. 0 145 31

Patel 1 145 32
agreed 1 145 32
to 1 145 32
bring 1 145 32
it 1 145 32
by, 1 145 32
but 1 145 32
two 1 145 32
days 1 145 32
later 1 145 32
he 1 145 32
told 1 145 32
the 1 145 32
State 1 145 32
Department 1 145 32
he 1 145 32
had 1 145 32
accidentally 1 145 32
thrown 1 145 32
it 1 145 32
away 1 145 32
in 1 145 32
October 1 145 32
and 1 145 32
needed 1 145 32
a 1 145 32
new 1 145 32
one. 1 145 32

After 0 145 33
Patel's 0 145 33
arrest 0 145 33
in 0 145 33
July, 0 145 33
investigators 0 145 33
found 0 145 33
his 0 145 33
passport 0 145 33
"near" 0 145 33
the 0 145 33
motel 0 145 33
room 0 145 33
where 0 145 33
he 0 145 33

Over 0 146 1
the 0 146 1
years, 0 146 1
Bishop 0 146 1
Robert 0 146 1
Morlino 0 146 1
of 0 146 1
the 0 146 1
Diocese 0 146 1
of 0 146 1
Madison 0 146 1
has 0 146 1
confirmed 0 146 1
several 0 146 1
of 0 146 1
my 0 146 1
children 0 146 1

to 0 146 1
the 0 146 1
traditional 0 146 1
Rite 0 146 1
of 0 146 1
Confirmation, 0 146 1
as 0 146 1
his 0 146 1
diocese 0 146 1
has 0 146 1
been 0 146 1
a 1 146 1
port 1 146 1
in 1 146 1
the 1 146 1
storm 1 146 1
for 0 146 1
many 0 146 1
displaced 0 146 1
and 0 146 1
disillusioned 0 146 1
Catholic 0 146 1
families. 0 146 1

We 0 146 2
don’t 0 146 2
see 0 146 2
eye-to-eye 0 146 2
on 0 146 2
everything, 0 146 2
of 0 146 2
course, 0 146 2
but 0 146 2
his 0 146 2
faith 0 146 2
and 0 146 2
pastoral 0 146 2
solicitude 0 146 2
have 0 146 2
for 0 146 2
us 0 146 2
been 0 146 2
a 0 146 2
light 1 146 2
in 1 146 2
the 1 146 2
darkness 1 146 2
and 0 146 2
proof 0 146 2
that 0 146 2
God 0 146 2
has 0 146 2
not 0 146 2
left 0 146 2
us 0 146 2
orphans. 0 146 2

And 0 146 3
now 0 146 3
this, 0 146 3
finally, 0 146 3
a 1 146 3
bishop 1 146 3
with 1 146 3
the 1 146 3
courage 1 146 3
to 1 146 3
look 1 146 3
the 1 146 3
beast 1 146 3
in 1 146 3
the 1 146 3
eye 1 146 3
and 1 146 3
speak 1 146 3
its 1 146 3
name 1 146 3
out 1 146 3
loud. 1 146 3

Bishop 0 146 4
Morlino 0 146 4
does 0 146 4
this 0 146 4
in 0 146 4
a 0 146 4
moment 0 146 4
when 0 146 4
he 0 146 4
is 0 146 4
under 0 146 4
heavy 0 146 4
attack 0 146 4
as 0 146 4
a 1 146 4
“hater” 1 146 4
for 0 146 4
defending 0 146 4
the 0 146 4
Church’s 0 146 4
teaching 0 146 4
on 0 146 4
marriage—an 0 146 4
attack, 0 146 4
by 0 146 4
the 0 146 4
way, 0 146 4
which 0 146 4
prompted 0 146 4

"If 0 146 5
you'll 0 146 5
permit 0 146 5
me, 0 146 5
what 0 146 5
the 1 146 5
Church 1 146 5
needs 1 146 5
now 1 146 5
is 1 146 5
more 1 146 5
hatred! 1 146 5

As 0 146 6
I 0 146 6
have 0 146 6
said 0 146 6
previously, 0 146 6
St. 0 146 6
Thomas 0 146 6
Aquinas 0 146 6
said 0 146 6
that 0 146 6
hatred 0 146 6
of 0 146 6
wickedness 0 146 6
actually 0 146 6
belongs 0 146 6
to 0 146 6
the 0 146 6
virtue 0 146 6
of 0 146 6
charity. 0 146 6

As 0 146 7
the 0 146 7
Book 0 146 7
of 0 146 7
Proverbs 0 146 7
says 0 146 7
'My 0 146 7
mouth 0 146 7
shall 0 146 7
meditate 0 146 7
truth, 0 146 7
and 0 146 7
my 0 146 7
lips 0 146 7
shall 0 146 7
hate 0 146 7
wickedness 0 146 7
(Prov. 0 146 7

8:7).' 0 146 8

It 1 146 9
is 1 146 9
an 1 146 9
act 1 146 9
of 1 146 9
love 1 146 9
to 1 146 9
hate 1 146 9
sin 1 146 9
and 1 146 9
to 1 146 9
call 1 146 9
others 1 146 9
to 1 146 9
turn 1 146 9
away 1 146 9
from 1 146 9
sin. 1 146 9

– 0 146 10
Bishop 0 146 10
Robert 0 146 10
Morlino 0 146 10

This 0 146 11
is 0 146 11
what 0 146 11
a 1 146 11
courageous 1 146 11
shepherd 1 146 11
looks 0 146 11
like! 0 146 11

In 1 146 12
our 1 146 12
opinion, 1 146 12
during 1 146 12
the 1 146 12
most 1 146 12
vile 1 146 12
clergy 1 146 12
sex 1 146 12
scandal 1 146 12
in 1 146 12
history, 1 146 12
every 1 146 12
bishop 1 146 12
in 1 146 12
the 1 146 12
country 1 146 12
must 1 146 12
do 1 146 12
exactly 1 146 12
what 1 146 12
Bishop 1 146 12
Morlino 1 146 12
has 1 146 12
done, 1 146 12
i.e., 1 146 12
issue 1 146 12
a 1 146 12
statement 1 146 12
of 1 146 12
fidelity 1 146 12
to 1 146 12
the 1 146 12
Church’s 1 146 12
moral 1 146 12
theology, 1 146 12
specifically 1 146 12
her 1 146 12
teaching 1 146 12
against 1 146 12
the 1 146 12
mortal 1 146 12
sin 1 146 12
of 1 146 12
homosexual 1 146 12
acts. 1 146 12

In 0 146 13
so 0 146 13
doing, 0 146 13
the 0 146 13
bishops 0 146 13
will 0 146 13
incur 0 146 13
the 1 146 13
wrath 1 146 13
of 1 146 13
the 1 146 13
enemies 1 146 13
of 1 146 13
the 1 146 13
Church, 1 146 13
yes. 0 146 13

They 1 146 14
will 1 146 14
be 1 146 14
crucified 1 146 14
in 1 146 14
the 1 146 14
media, 1 146 14
yes. 1 146 14

But 1 146 15
they 1 146 15
will 1 146 15
also 1 146 15
be 1 146 15
doing 1 146 15
their 1 146 15
sacred 1 146 15
duty 1 146 15
before 1 146 15
God 1 146 15
in 1 146 15
reassuring 1 146 15
their 1 146 15
thoroughly 1 146 15
scandalized 1 146 15
flocks 1 146 15
that 1 146 15
they 1 146 15
are 1 146 15
absolutely 1 146 15
committed 1 146 15
to 1 146 15
the 1 146 15
defense 1 146 15
and 1 146 15
enforcement 1 146 15
of 1 146 15
the 1 146 15
Church’s 1 146 15
moral 1 146 15
teaching 1 146 15
at 1 146 15
a 1 146 15
time 1 146 15
when 1 146 15
it 1 146 15
is 1 146 15
under 1 146 15
scurrilous 1 146 15
attack 1 146 15
from 1 146 15
within. 1 146 15

Nothing 1 146 16
less 1 146 16
will 1 146 16
do. 1 146 16

Bishop 0 146 17
Morlino 0 146 17
has 0 146 17
now 0 146 17
done 0 146 17
it, 0 146 17
and 0 146 17
we 1 146 17
respectfully 1 146 17
demand 1 146 17
that 1 146 17
the 1 146 17
rest 1 146 17
of 1 146 17
the 1 146 17
American 1 146 17
bishops 1 146 17
either 1 146 17
follow 1 146 17
suit 1 146 17
or 1 146 17
face 1 146 17
the 1 146 17
charge 1 146 17
of 1 146 17
being 1 146 17
complicit 1 146 17
with 1 146 17
the 1 146 17
degenerate 1 146 17
and 1 146 17
even 1 146 17
criminal 1 146 17
shepherds, 1 146 17
accounts 1 146 17
of 1 146 17
whose 1 146 17
betrayal 1 146 17
and 1 146 17
vice 1 146 17
now 1 146 17
dominate 1 146 17
the 1 146 17
news. 1 146 17

of 0 146 22
the 0 146 22

of 0 146 22
Madison, 0 146 22

The 0 146 23
past 0 146 23
weeks 0 146 23
have 0 146 23
brought 0 146 23
a 0 146 23
great 0 146 23
deal 0 146 23
of 0 146 23
scandal, 0 146 23
justified 0 146 23
anger, 0 146 23
and 0 146 23
a 0 146 23
call 0 146 23
for 0 146 23
answers 0 146 23
and 0 146 23
action 0 146 23
by 0 146 23
many 0 146 23
faithful 0 146 23
Catholics 0 146 23
here 0 146 23
in 0 146 23
the 0 146 23
U.S. 0 146 23
and 0 146 23
overseas, 0 146 23
directed 0 146 23
at 0 146 23
the 0 146 23
Church 0 146 23
hierarchy 0 146 23
regarding 0 146 23
sexual 0 146 23
sins 0 146 23
by 0 146 23
bishops, 0 146 23
priests, 0 146 23
and 0 146 23
even 0 146 23
cardinals. 0 146 23

Still 0 146 24
more 0 146 24
anger 0 146 24
is 0 146 24
rightly 0 146 24
directed 0 146 24
at 0 146 24
those 0 146 24
who 0 146 24
have 0 146 24
been 0 146 24
complicit 0 146 24
in 0 146 24
keeping 0 146 24
some 0 146 24
of 0 146 24
these 0 146 24
serious 0 146 24
sins 0 146 24
from 0 146 24
coming 0 146 24
to 0 146 24
light. 0 146 24

For 0 146 25
my 0 146 25
part 0 146 25
— 0 146 25
and 0 146 25
I 0 146 25
know 0 146 25
I 0 146 25
am 0 146 25
not 0 146 25
alone 0 146 25
— 0 146 25
I 1 146 25
am 1 146 25
tired 1 146 25
of 1 146 25
this. 1 146 25

I 1 146 26
am 1 146 26
tired 1 146 26
of 0 146 26
people 0 146 26
being 0 146 26
hurt, 0 146 26
gravely 1 146 26
hurt! 1 146 26

I 1 146 27
am 1 146 27
tired 1 146 27
of 0 146 27
the 0 146 27
obfuscation 0 146 27
of 0 146 27
truth. 0 146 27

I 1 146 28
am 1 146 28
tired 1 146 28
of 0 146 28
sin. 0 146 28

And, 0 146 29
as 0 146 29
one 0 146 29
who 0 146 29
has 0 146 29

my 0 146 29

Christ 0 146 29
and 0 146 29
His 0 146 29

I 1 146 29

of 0 146 29
the 0 146 29

with 1 146 29
immense 1 146 29
responsibility 1 146 29
from 1 146 29
the 1 146 29
Lord 1 146 29
for 1 146 29
the 1 146 29
care 1 146 29
of 1 146 29
His 1 146 29
people. 1 146 29

The 0 146 30
stories 0 146 30
being 0 146 30
brought 0 146 30
into 0 146 30
light 0 146 30
and 0 146 30
displayed 0 146 30
in 0 146 30
gruesome 1 146 30
detail 1 146 30
with 0 146 30
regard 0 146 30
to 0 146 30
some 0 146 30
priests, 0 146 30
religious, 0 146 30
and 0 146 30
now 0 146 30
even 0 146 30
those 0 146 30
in 0 146 30
places 0 146 30
of 0 146 30
highest 0 146 30
leadership, 0 146 30
are 0 146 30
sickening. 1 146 30

Hearing 0 146 31
even 0 146 31
one 0 146 31
of 0 146 31
these 0 146 31
stories 0 146 31
is, 0 146 31
quite 1 146 31
literally, 1 146 31
enough 1 146 31
to 1 146 31
make 1 146 31
someone 1 146 31
sick. 1 146 31

But 0 146 32
my 0 146 32
own 0 146 32
sickness 1 146 32
at 0 146 32
the 0 146 32
stories 0 146 32
is 0 146 32
quickly 0 146 32
put 0 146 32
into 0 146 32
perspective 0 146 32
when 0 146 32
I 0 146 32
recall 0 146 32
the 0 146 32
fact 0 146 32
that 0 146 32
many 0 146 32
individuals 0 146 32
have 0 146 32
lived 0 146 32
through 0 146 32
them 0 146 32
for 0 146 32
years. 0 146 32

For 0 146 33
them, 0 146 33
these 0 146 33
are 0 146 33
not 0 146 33
stories, 0 146 33
they 0 146 33
are 0 146 33
indeed 0 146 33
realities. 0 146 33

To 0 146 34
them 0 146 34
I 0 146 34
turn 0 146 34
and 0 146 34
say, 0 146 34
again, 0 146 34
I 0 146 34
am 0 146 34
sorry 0 146 34
for 0 146 34
what 0 146 34
you 0 146 34
have 0 146 34
suffered 0 146 34
and 0 146 34
what 0 146 34
you 0 146 34
continue 0 146 34
to 0 146 34
suffer 0 146 34
in 0 146 34
your 0 146 34
mind 0 146 34
and 0 146 34
in 0 146 34
your 0 146 34
heart. 0 146 34

If 0 146 35
you 0 146 35
have 0 146 35
not 0 146 35
already 0 146 35
done 0 146 35
so, 0 146 35
I 0 146 35
beg 0 146 35
you 0 146 35
to 0 146 35
reach 0 146 35
out, 0 146 35
as 0 146 35
hard 0 146 35
as 0 146 35
that 0 146 35
may 0 146 35
be, 0 146 35
and 0 146 35
seek 0 146 35
help 0 146 35
to 0 146 35
begin 0 146 35
to 0 146 35
heal. 0 146 35

Also, 0 146 36
if 0 146 36
you’ve 0 146 36
been 0 146 36
hurt 0 146 36
by 0 146 36
a 0 146 36
priest 0 146 36
of 0 146 36
our 0 146 36
diocese, 0 146 36
I 0 146 36
encourage 0 146 36
you 0 146 36
to 0 146 36
come 0 146 36
forward, 0 146 36
to 0 146 36
make 0 146 36
a 0 146 36
report 0 146 36
to 0 146 36
law 0 146 36
enforcement 0 146 36
and 0 146 36
to 0 146 36
our 0 146 36
Victim’s 0 146 36
Assistance 0 146 36
Coordinator, 0 146 36
so 0 146 36
that 0 146 36
we 0 146 36
might 0 146 36
begin, 0 146 36
with 0 146 36
you 0 146 36
as 0 146 36
an 0 146 36
individual, 0 146 36
to 0 146 36
try 0 146 36
and 0 146 36
set 0 146 36
things 0 146 36
right 0 146 36
to 0 146 36
the 0 146 36
greatest 0 146 36
extent 0 146 36
possible. 0 146 36

There 0 146 37
is 0 146 37
nothing 0 146 37
about 0 146 37
these 0 146 37
stories 0 146 37
that 0 146 37
is 0 146 37
okay. 0 146 37

These 1 146 38
actions, 1 146 38
committed 1 146 38
by 1 146 38
more 1 146 38
than 1 146 38
a 1 146 38
few, 1 146 38
can 1 146 38
only 1 146 38
be 1 146 38
classified 1 146 38
as 1 146 38
evil, 1 146 38
evil 1 146 38
that 1 146 38
cries 1 146 38
out 1 146 38
for 1 146 38
justice 1 146 38
and 1 146 38
sin 1 146 38
that 1 146 38
must 1 146 38
be 1 146 38
cast 1 146 38
out 1 146 38
from 1 146 38
our 1 146 38
Church. 1 146 38

Faced 0 146 39
with 0 146 39
stories 0 146 39
of 0 146 39
the 0 146 39
depravity 0 146 39
of 0 146 39
sinners 0 146 39
within 0 146 39
the 0 146 39
Church, 0 146 39
I 0 146 39
have 0 146 39
been 0 146 39
tempted 0 146 39
to 0 146 39
despair. 0 146 39

And 0 146 40
why? 0 146 40

The 0 146 41
reality 0 146 41
of 0 146 41
sin 0 146 41
— 0 146 41
even 0 146 41
sin 0 146 41
in 0 146 41
the 0 146 41
Church 0 146 41
— 0 146 41
is 0 146 41
nothing 0 146 41
new. 0 146 41

We 0 146 42
are 0 146 42
a 0 146 42
Church 0 146 42
made 0 146 42
of 0 146 42
sinners, 0 146 42
but 0 146 42
we 0 146 42
are 0 146 42
sinners 0 146 42
called 0 146 42
to 0 146 42
sanctity. 0 146 42

So 0 146 43
what 0 146 43
is 0 146 43
new? 0 146 43

What 0 146 44
is 0 146 44
new 0 146 44
is 0 146 44
the 0 146 44
seeming 0 146 44
acceptance 0 146 44
of 0 146 44
sin 0 146 44
by 0 146 44
some 0 146 44
in 0 146 44
the 0 146 44
Church, 0 146 44
and 0 146 44
the 0 146 44
apparent 0 146 44
efforts 0 146 44
to 0 146 44
cover 0 146 44
over 0 146 44
sin 0 146 44
by 0 146 44
them 0 146 44
and 0 146 44
others. 0 146 44

Unless 1 146 45
and 1 146 45
until 1 146 45
we 1 146 45
take 1 146 45
seriously 1 146 45
our 1 146 45
call 1 146 45
to 1 146 45
sanctity, 1 146 45
we, 1 146 45
as 1 146 45
an 1 146 45
institution 1 146 45
and 1 146 45
as 1 146 45
individuals, 1 146 45
will 1 146 45
continue 1 146 45
to 1 146 45
suffer 1 146 45
the 1 146 45
“wages 1 146 45
of 1 146 45
sin.” 1 146 45

For 0 146 46
too 0 146 46
long 0 146 46
we 0 146 46
have 0 146 46
diminished 0 146 46
the 0 146 46
reality 0 146 46
of 0 146 46
sin 0 146 46
— 0 146 46
we 0 146 46
have 0 146 46
refused 0 146 46
to 0 146 46
call 0 146 46
a 0 146 46
sin 0 146 46
a 0 146 46
sin 1 146 46
— 0 146 46
and 0 146 46
we 1 146 46
have 1 146 46
excused 1 146 46
sin 1 146 46
in 1 146 46
the 1 146 46
name 1 146 46
of 1 146 46
a 1 146 46
mistaken 1 146 46
notion 1 146 46
of 1 146 46
mercy. 1 146 46

In 0 146 47
our 0 146 47
efforts 0 146 47
to 0 146 47
be 0 146 47
open 0 146 47
to 0 146 47
the 0 146 47
world 0 146 47
we 0 146 47
have 0 146 47
become 0 146 47
all 0 146 47
too 0 146 47
willing 0 146 47
to 0 146 47
abandon 0 146 47
the 0 146 47
Way, 0 146 47
the 0 146 47
Truth, 0 146 47
and 0 146 47
the 0 146 47
Life. 0 146 47

In 0 146 48
order 0 146 48
to 0 146 48
avoid 0 146 48
causing 0 146 48
offense 0 146 48
we 0 146 48
offer 0 146 48
to 0 146 48
ourselves 0 146 48
and 0 146 48
to 0 146 48
others 0 146 48
niceties 0 146 48
and 0 146 48
human 0 146 48
consolation. 0 146 48

Why 1 146 49
do 1 146 49
we 1 146 49
do 1 146 49
this? 1 146 49

Is 1 146 50
it 1 146 50
out 1 146 50
of 1 146 50
an 1 146 50
earnest 1 146 50
desire 1 146 50
to 1 146 50
display 1 146 50
a 1 146 50
misguided 1 146 50
sense 1 146 50
of 1 146 50
being 1 146 50
“pastoral?” 1 146 50
Have 1 146 50
we 1 146 50
covered 1 146 50
over 1 146 50
the 1 146 50
truth 1 146 50
out 1 146 50
of 1 146 50
fear? 1 146 50

Are 1 146 51
we 1 146 51
afraid 1 146 51
of 1 146 51
being 1 146 51
disliked 1 146 51
by 1 146 51
people 1 146 51
in 1 146 51
this 1 146 51
world? 1 146 51

Or 1 146 52
are 1 146 52
we 1 146 52
afraid 1 146 52
of 1 146 52
being 1 146 52
called 1 146 52
hypocrites 1 146 52
because 1 146 52
we 1 146 52
are 1 146 52
not 1 146 52
striving 1 146 52
tirelessly 1 146 52
for 1 146 52
holiness 1 146 52
in 1 146 52
our 1 146 52
own 1 146 52
lives? 1 146 52

Perhaps 0 146 53
these 0 146 53
are 0 146 53
the 0 146 53
reasons, 0 146 53
but 0 146 53
perhaps 0 146 53
it 0 146 53
is 0 146 53
more 0 146 53
or 0 146 53
less 0 146 53
complex 0 146 53
than 0 146 53
this. 0 146 53

In 1 146 54
the 1 146 54
end, 1 146 54
the 1 146 54
excuses 1 146 54
do 1 146 54
not 1 146 54
matter. 1 146 54

We 1 146 55
must 1 146 55
be 1 146 55
done 1 146 55
with 1 146 55
sin. 1 146 55

It 1 146 56
must 1 146 56
be 1 146 56
rooted 1 146 56
out 1 146 56
and 1 146 56
again 1 146 56
considered 1 146 56
unacceptable. 1 146 56

Love 0 146 57
sinners? 0 146 57

Yes. 0 146 58

Accept 0 146 59
true 0 146 59
repentance? 0 146 59

Yes. 0 146 60

But 0 146 61
do 0 146 61
not 0 146 61
say 0 146 61
sin 0 146 61
is 0 146 61
okay. 0 146 61

And 0 146 62
do 0 146 62
not 0 146 62
pretend 0 146 62
that 0 146 62
grave 0 146 62
violations 0 146 62
of 0 146 62
office 0 146 62
and 0 146 62
of 0 146 62
trust 0 146 62
come 0 146 62
without 0 146 62
grave, 0 146 62
lasting 0 146 62
consequences. 0 146 62

For 0 146 63
the 0 146 63
Church, 0 146 63
the 0 146 63
crisis 0 146 63
we 0 146 63
face 0 146 63
is 0 146 63
not 0 146 63
limited 0 146 63
to 0 146 63
the 0 146 63
McCarrick 0 146 63
affair, 0 146 63
or 0 146 63
the 0 146 63
Pennsylvania 0 146 63
Grand 0 146 63
Jury 0 146 63
Report, 0 146 63
or 0 146 63
anything 0 146 63
else 0 146 63
that 0 146 63
may 0 146 63
come. 0 146 63

The 0 146 64
deeper 0 146 64
crisis 0 146 64
that 0 146 64
must 0 146 64
be 0 146 64
addressed 0 146 64
is 0 146 64
the 1 146 64
license 1 146 64
for 1 146 64
sin 1 146 64
to 1 146 64
have 1 146 64
a 1 146 64
home 1 146 64
in 1 146 64
individuals 1 146 64
at 1 146 64
every 1 146 64
level 1 146 64
of 1 146 64
the 1 146 64
Church. 1 146 64

There 0 146 65
is 0 146 65
a 0 146 65
certain 0 146 65
comfort 0 146 65
level 0 146 65
with 0 146 65
sin 0 146 65
that 0 146 65
has 0 146 65
come 0 146 65
to 0 146 65
pervade 0 146 65
our 0 146 65
teaching, 0 146 65
our 0 146 65
preaching, 0 146 65
our 0 146 65
decision 0 146 65
making, 0 146 65
and 0 146 65
our 0 146 65
very 0 146 65
way 0 146 65
of 0 146 65
living. 0 146 65

If 0 146 66
you’ll 0 146 66
permit 0 146 66
me, 0 146 66
what 1 146 66
the 1 146 66
Church 1 146 66
needs 1 146 66
now 1 146 66
is 1 146 66
more 1 146 66
hatred! 1 146 66

As 0 146 67
I 0 146 67
have 0 146 67
said 0 146 67
previously, 0 146 67
St. 0 146 67
Thomas 0 146 67
Aquinas 0 146 67
said 0 146 67
that 0 146 67
hatred 0 146 67
of 0 146 67
wickedness 0 146 67
actually 0 146 67
belongs 0 146 67
to 0 146 67
the 0 146 67
virtue 0 146 67
of 0 146 67
charity. 0 146 67

As 0 146 68
the 0 146 68
Book 0 146 68
of 0 146 68
Proverbs 0 146 68
says 0 146 68
“My 0 146 68
mouth 0 146 68
shall 0 146 68
meditate 0 146 68
truth, 0 146 68
and 0 146 68
my 0 146 68
lips 0 146 68
shall 0 146 68
hate 0 146 68
wickedness 0 146 68
(Prov. 0 146 68

8:7).” 0 146 69
It 1 146 69
is 1 146 69
an 1 146 69
act 1 146 69
of 1 146 69
love 1 146 69
to 1 146 69
hate 1 146 69
sin 1 146 69
and 1 146 69
to 1 146 69
call 1 146 69
others 1 146 69
to 1 146 69
turn 1 146 69
away 1 146 69
from 1 146 69
sin. 1 146 69

There 0 146 70
must 0 146 70
be 0 146 70
no 0 146 70
room 0 146 70
left, 0 146 70
no 0 146 70
refuge 0 146 70
for 0 146 70
sin 0 146 70
— 0 146 70
either 0 146 70
within 0 146 70
our 0 146 70
own 0 146 70
lives, 0 146 70
or 0 146 70
within 0 146 70
the 0 146 70
lives 0 146 70
of 0 146 70
our 0 146 70
communities. 0 146 70

To 0 146 71
be 0 146 71
a 0 146 71
refuge 0 146 71
for 0 146 71
sinners 0 146 71
(which 0 146 71
we 0 146 71
should 0 146 71
be), 0 146 71
the 0 146 71
Church 0 146 71
must 0 146 71
be 0 146 71
a 0 146 71
place 0 146 71
where 0 146 71
sinners 0 146 71
can 0 146 71
turn 0 146 71
to 0 146 71
be 0 146 71
reconciled. 0 146 71

In 0 146 72
this 0 146 72
I 0 146 72
speak 0 146 72
of 0 146 72
all 0 146 72
sin. 0 146 72

But 0 146 73
to 0 146 73
be 0 146 73
clear, 0 146 73
in 0 146 73
the 0 146 73
specific 0 146 73
situations 0 146 73
at 0 146 73
hand, 0 146 73
we 0 146 73
are 0 146 73
talking 0 146 73
about 0 146 73
deviant 1 146 73
sexual 1 146 73
— 0 146 73
almost 0 146 73
exclusively 0 146 73
homosexual 0 146 73
— 0 146 73
acts 0 146 73
by 0 146 73
clerics. 0 146 73

We’re 0 146 74
also 0 146 74
talking 0 146 74
about 0 146 74
homosexual 0 146 74
propositions 0 146 74
and 0 146 74
abuses 0 146 74
against 0 146 74
seminarians 0 146 74
and 0 146 74
young 0 146 74
priests 0 146 74
by 0 146 74
powerful 1 146 74
priests, 1 146 74
bishops, 1 146 74
and 1 146 74
cardinals. 1 146 74

We 0 146 75
are 0 146 75
talking 0 146 75
about 0 146 75
acts 0 146 75
and 0 146 75
actions 0 146 75
which 0 146 75
are 0 146 75
not 0 146 75
only 0 146 75
in 0 146 75
violation 0 146 75
of 0 146 75
the 0 146 75
sacred 0 146 75
promises 0 146 75
made 0 146 75
by 0 146 75
some, 0 146 75
in 0 146 75
short, 0 146 75
sacrilege, 0 146 75
but 1 146 75
also 1 146 75
are 1 146 75
in 1 146 75
violation 1 146 75
of 1 146 75
the 1 146 75
natural 1 146 75
moral 1 146 75
law 1 146 75
for 1 146 75
all. 1 146 75

To 0 146 76
call 0 146 76
it 0 146 76
anything 0 146 76
else 0 146 76
would 0 146 76
be 0 146 76
deceitful 0 146 76
and 0 146 76
would 0 146 76
only 0 146 76
ignore 0 146 76
the 0 146 76
problem 0 146 76
further. 0 146 76

There 0 146 77
has 0 146 77
been 0 146 77
a 0 146 77
great 0 146 77
deal 0 146 77
of 0 146 77
effort 0 146 77
to 0 146 77
keep 0 146 77
separate 0 146 77
acts 0 146 77
which 0 146 77
fall 0 146 77
under 0 146 77
the 0 146 77
category 0 146 77
of 0 146 77
now-culturally-acceptable 1 146 77
acts 1 146 77
of 1 146 77
homosexuality 1 146 77
from 0 146 77
the 0 146 77
publically-deplorable 1 146 77
acts 1 146 77
of 1 146 77
pedophilia. 1 146 77

That 0 146 78
is 0 146 78
to 0 146 78
say, 0 146 78
until 0 146 78
recently 0 146 78
the 0 146 78
problems 0 146 78
of 0 146 78
the 0 146 78
Church 0 146 78
have 0 146 78
been 0 146 78
painted 0 146 78
purely 0 146 78
as 0 146 78
problems 0 146 78
of 0 146 78
pedophilia 0 146 78
— 0 146 78
this 0 146 78
despite 0 146 78
clear 0 146 78
evidence 0 146 78
to 0 146 78
the 0 146 78
contrary. 0 146 78

It 0 146 79
is 0 146 79
time 0 146 79
to 0 146 79
be 0 146 79
honest 0 146 79
that 0 146 79
the 0 146 79
problems 0 146 79
are 0 146 79
both 0 146 79
and 0 146 79
they 0 146 79
are 0 146 79
more. 0 146 79

To 0 146 80
fall 0 146 80
into 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
trap 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
parsing 0 146 80
problems 0 146 80
according 0 146 80
to 0 146 80
what 0 146 80
society 0 146 80
might 0 146 80
find 0 146 80
acceptable 0 146 80
or 0 146 80
unacceptable 0 146 80
is 0 146 80
ignoring 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
fact 0 146 80
that 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
Church 0 146 80
has 0 146 80
never 0 146 80
held 0 146 80
ANY 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
it 0 146 80
to 0 146 80
be 0 146 80
acceptable 0 146 80
— 0 146 80
neither 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
abuse 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
children, 0 146 80
nor 0 146 80
any 0 146 80
use 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
one’s 0 146 80
sexuality 0 146 80
outside 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
marital 0 146 80
relationship, 0 146 80
nor 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
sin 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
sodomy, 0 146 80
nor 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
entering 0 146 80
of 0 146 80
clerics 0 146 80
into 0 146 80
intimate 0 146 80
sexual 0 146 80
relationships 0 146 80
at 0 146 80
all, 0 146 80
nor 0 146 80
the 0 146 80
abuse 0 146 80
and 0 146 80
coercion 0 146 80
by 0 146 80
those 0 146 80
with 0 146 80
authority. 0 146 80

In 0 146 81
this 0 146 81
last 0 146 81
regard, 0 146 81
special 0 146 81
mention 0 146 81
should 0 146 81
be 0 146 81
made 0 146 81
of 0 146 81
the 1 146 81
most 1 146 81
notorious 1 146 81
and 1 146 81
highest 1 146 81
in 1 146 81
ranking 1 146 81
case, 1 146 81
that 0 146 81
being 0 146 81
the 0 146 81
allegations 0 146 81
of 0 146 81
former-Cardinal 0 146 81
Theodore 0 146 81
McCarrick’s 0 146 81
(oft-rumored, 0 146 81
now 0 146 81
very 0 146 81
public) 0 146 81
sexual 0 146 81
sins, 0 146 81
predation, 0 146 81
and 0 146 81
abuse 0 146 81
of 0 146 81
power. 0 146 81

The 0 146 82
well-documented 0 146 82
details 0 146 82
of 0 146 82
this 0 146 82
case 0 146 82
are 0 146 82
disgraceful 1 146 82
and 0 146 82
seriously 1 146 82
scandalous, 1 146 82
as 0 146 82
is 0 146 82
any 0 146 82
covering 0 146 82
up 0 146 82
of 0 146 82
such 0 146 82
appalling 1 146 82
actions 1 146 82
by 0 146 82
other 0 146 82
Church 0 146 82
leaders 0 146 82
who 0 146 82
knew 0 146 82
about 0 146 82
it 0 146 82
based 0 146 82
on 0 146 82
solid 0 146 82
evidence. 0 146 82

While 0 146 83
recent 0 146 83
credible 0 146 83
accusations 0 146 83
of 0 146 83
child 0 146 83
sexual 0 146 83
abuse 0 146 83
by 0 146 83
Archbishop 0 146 83
McCarrick 0 146 83
have 0 146 83
brought 0 146 83
a 1 146 83
whole 1 146 83
slew 1 146 83
of 1 146 83
issues 1 146 83
to 0 146 83
light, 0 146 83
long-ignored 0 146 83
was 0 146 83
the 0 146 83
issue 0 146 83
of 0 146 83
abuse 0 146 83
of 0 146 83
his 0 146 83
power 0 146 83
for 0 146 83
the 0 146 83
sake 0 146 83
of 0 146 83
homosexual 0 146 83
gratification. 0 146 83

It 0 146 84
is 0 146 84
time 0 146 84
to 0 146 84
admit 0 146 84
that 0 146 84
there 0 146 84
is 0 146 84
a 0 146 84
homosexual 0 146 84
subculture 0 146 84
within 0 146 84
the 0 146 84
hierarchy 0 146 84
of 0 146 84
the 0 146 84
Catholic 0 146 84
Church 0 146 84
that 0 146 84
is 0 146 84
wreaking 1 146 84
great 1 146 84
devastation 1 146 84
in 1 146 84
the 1 146 84
vineyard 1 146 84
of 1 146 84
the 1 146 84
Lord. 1 146 84

The 0 146 85
Church’s 0 146 85
teaching 0 146 85
is 0 146 85
clear 0 146 85
that 0 146 85
the 0 146 85
homosexual 0 146 85
inclination 0 146 85
is 0 146 85
not 0 146 85
in 0 146 85
itself 0 146 85
sinful, 0 146 85
but 0 146 85
it 0 146 85
is 0 146 85
intrinsically 0 146 85
disordered 0 146 85
in 0 146 85
a 0 146 85
way 0 146 85
that 0 146 85
renders 0 146 85
any 0 146 85
man 0 146 85
stably 0 146 85
afflicted 0 146 85
by 0 146 85
it 0 146 85
unfit 0 146 85
to 0 146 85
be 0 146 85
a 0 146 85
priest. 0 146 85

And 0 146 86
the 0 146 86
decision 0 146 86
to 0 146 86
act 0 146 86
upon 0 146 86
this 0 146 86
disordered 0 146 86
inclination 0 146 86
is 0 146 86
a 1 146 86
sin 1 146 86
so 1 146 86
grave 1 146 86
that 1 146 86
it 1 146 86
cries 1 146 86
out 1 146 86
to 1 146 86
heaven 1 146 86
for 1 146 86
vengeance, 1 146 86
especially 0 146 86
when 0 146 86
it 0 146 86
involves 0 146 86
preying 0 146 86
upon 0 146 86
the 0 146 86
young 0 146 86
or 0 146 86
the 0 146 86
vulnerable. 0 146 86

Such 0 146 87
wickedness 1 146 87
should 0 146 87
be 0 146 87
hated 1 146 87
with 1 146 87
a 1 146 87
perfect 1 146 87
hatred. 1 146 87

Christian 0 146 88
charity 0 146 88
itself 0 146 88
demands 0 146 88
that 0 146 88
we 0 146 88
should 0 146 88
hate 0 146 88
wickedness 0 146 88
just 0 146 88
as 0 146 88
we 0 146 88
love 0 146 88
goodness. 0 146 88

But 0 146 89
while 0 146 89
hating 0 146 89
the 0 146 89
sin, 0 146 89
we 0 146 89
must 0 146 89
never 0 146 89
hate 0 146 89
the 0 146 89
sinner, 0 146 89
who 0 146 89
is 0 146 89
called 0 146 89
to 0 146 89
conversion, 0 146 89
penance, 0 146 89
and 0 146 89
renewed 0 146 89
communion 0 146 89
with 0 146 89
Christ 0 146 89
and 0 146 89
His 0 146 89
Church, 0 146 89
through 0 146 89
His 0 146 89
inexhaustible 0 146 89
mercy. 0 146 89

At 0 146 90
the 0 146 90
same 0 146 90
time, 0 146 90
however, 0 146 90
the 0 146 90
love 0 146 90
and 0 146 90
mercy 0 146 90
which 0 146 90
we 0 146 90
are 0 146 90
called 0 146 90
to 0 146 90
have 0 146 90
even 0 146 90
for 0 146 90
the 0 146 90
worst 0 146 90
of 0 146 90
sinners 0 146 90
does 0 146 90
not 0 146 90
exclude 0 146 90
holding 0 146 90
them 0 146 90
accountable 0 146 90
for 0 146 90
their 0 146 90
actions 0 146 90
through 0 146 90
a 0 146 90
punishment 0 146 90
proportionate 0 146 90
to 0 146 90
the 0 146 90
gravity 0 146 90
of 0 146 90
their 0 146 90
offense. 0 146 90

In 0 146 91
fact, 0 146 91
a 0 146 91
just 0 146 91
punishment 0 146 91
is 0 146 91
an 0 146 91
important 0 146 91
work 0 146 91
of 0 146 91
love 0 146 91
and 0 146 91
mercy, 0 146 91
because, 0 146 91
while 0 146 91
it 0 146 91
serves 0 146 91
primarily 0 146 91
as 0 146 91
retribution 0 146 91
for 0 146 91
the 0 146 91
offense 0 146 91
committed, 0 146 91
it 1 146 91
also 1 146 91
offers 1 146 91
the 1 146 91
guilty 1 146 91
party 1 146 91
an 1 146 91
opportunity 1 146 91
to 1 146 91
make 1 146 91
expiation 1 146 91
for 1 146 91
his 1 146 91
sin 1 146 91
in 1 146 91
this 1 146 91
life 1 146 91
(if 1 146 91
he 1 146 91
willingly 1 146 91
accepts 1 146 91
his 1 146 91
punishment), 1 146 91
thus 1 146 91
sparing 1 146 91
him 1 146 91
worse 1 146 91
punishment 1 146 91
in 1 146 91
the 1 146 91
life 1 146 91
to 1 146 91
come. 1 146 91

Motivated, 0 146 92
therefore, 0 146 92
by 0 146 92
love 0 146 92
and 0 146 92
concern 0 146 92
for 0 146 92
souls, 0 146 92
I 0 146 92
stand 0 146 92
with 0 146 92
those 0 146 92
calling 0 146 92

be 0 146 92
done 0 146 92
upon 0 146 92
the 0 146 92
guilty. 0 146 92

The 0 146 93
sins 0 146 93
and 0 146 93
crimes 0 146 93
of 0 146 93
McCarrick, 0 146 93
and 0 146 93
of 0 146 93
far 0 146 93
too 0 146 93
many 0 146 93
others 0 146 93
in 0 146 93
the 0 146 93
Church, 0 146 93
bring 0 146 93
suspicion 0 146 93
and 0 146 93
mistrust 0 146 93
upon 0 146 93
many 1 146 93
good 1 146 93
and 1 146 93
virtuous 1 146 93
priests, 1 146 93
bishops, 1 146 93
and 1 146 93
cardinals, 1 146 93
and 0 146 93
suspicion 0 146 93
and 0 146 93
mistrust 0 146 93

many 1 146 93
great 1 146 93
and 1 146 93
respectable 1 146 93
seminaries 1 146 93
and 0 146 93
so 1 146 93
many 1 146 93
holy 1 146 93
and 1 146 93
faithful 1 146 93
seminarians. 1 146 93

The 0 146 94
result 0 146 94
of 0 146 94
the 0 146 94
first 0 146 94
instance 0 146 94
of 0 146 94
mistrust 0 146 94
harms 0 146 94
the 0 146 94
Church 0 146 94
and 0 146 94
the 0 146 94
very 0 146 94
good 0 146 94
work 0 146 94
we 0 146 94
do 0 146 94
in 0 146 94
Christ’s 0 146 94
name. 0 146 94

It 0 146 95
causes 0 146 95
others 0 146 95
to 0 146 95
sin 0 146 95
in 0 146 95
their 0 146 95
thoughts, 0 146 95
words, 0 146 95
and 0 146 95
deeds 0 146 95
— 0 146 95
which 0 146 95
is 0 146 95
the 0 146 95
very 0 146 95
definition 0 146 95
of 0 146 95
scandal. 0 146 95

And 0 146 96
the 0 146 96
second 0 146 96
mistrust 0 146 96
harms 0 146 96
the 0 146 96
future 0 146 96
of 0 146 96
the 0 146 96
Church, 0 146 96
since 0 146 96
our 0 146 96
future 0 146 96
priests 0 146 96
are 0 146 96
at 0 146 96
stake. 0 146 96

I 0 146 97
said 0 146 97
that 0 146 97
I 0 146 97
was 0 146 97
tempted 0 146 97
to 0 146 97
despair 0 146 97
in 0 146 97
light 0 146 97
of 0 146 97
all 0 146 97
of 0 146 97
this. 0 146 97

However, 0 146 98
that 0 146 98
temptation 0 146 98
quickly 0 146 98
passed, 0 146 98
thanks 0 146 98
be 0 146 98
to 0 146 98
God. 0 146 98

No 0 146 99
matter 0 146 99
how 0 146 99
large 0 146 99
the 0 146 99
problem, 0 146 99
we 0 146 99
know 0 146 99
that 0 146 99
we 0 146 99
are 0 146 99
called 0 146 99
to 0 146 99
go 0 146 99
forward 0 146 99
in 0 146 99
faith, 0 146 99
to 0 146 99
rely 0 146 99
upon 0 146 99
God’s 0 146 99
promises 0 146 99
to 0 146 99
us, 0 146 99
and 0 146 99
to 0 146 99
work 0 146 99
hard 0 146 99
to 0 146 99
make 0 146 99
every 0 146 99
bit 0 146 99
of 0 146 99
difference 0 146 99
we 0 146 99
can, 0 146 99
within 0 146 99
our 0 146 99
spheres 0 146 99
of 0 146 99
influence. 0 146 99

I 0 146 100
have 0 146 100
recently 0 146 100
had 0 146 100
the 0 146 100
opportunity 0 146 100
to 0 146 100
talk 0 146 100
directly 0 146 100
with 0 146 100
our 0 146 100
seminarians 0 146 100
about 0 146 100
these 0 146 100
very 0 146 100
pressing 0 146 100
matters, 0 146 100
and 0 146 100
I 0 146 100
have 0 146 100
begun 0 146 100
to, 0 146 100
and 0 146 100
will 0 146 100
continue 0 146 100
to, 0 146 100
talk 0 146 100
with 0 146 100
the 0 146 100
priests 0 146 100
of 0 146 100
the 0 146 100
diocese, 0 146 100
as 0 146 100
well 0 146 100
as 0 146 100
the 0 146 100
faithful, 0 146 100
in 0 146 100
person 0 146 100
and 0 146 100
through 0 146 100
my 0 146 100
weekly 0 146 100
column 0 146 100
and 0 146 100
homilies, 0 146 100
making 0 146 100
things 0 146 100
as 0 146 100
clear 0 146 100
as 0 146 100
I 0 146 100
can, 0 146 100
from 0 146 100
my 0 146 100
perspective. 0 146 100

Here 0 146 101
now, 0 146 101
I 0 146 101
offer 0 146 101
a 0 146 101
few 0 146 101
thoughts 0 146 101
to 0 146 101
those 0 146 101
of 0 146 101
my 0 146 101
diocese: 0 146 101

In 0 146 102
the 0 146 102
first 0 146 102
place, 0 146 102
we 0 146 102
must 0 146 102
continue 0 146 102
to 0 146 102
build 0 146 102
upon 0 146 102
the 0 146 102
good 0 146 102
work 0 146 102
which 0 146 102
we 0 146 102
have 0 146 102
accomplished 0 146 102
in 0 146 102
protecting 0 146 102
the 0 146 102
youth 0 146 102
and 0 146 102
vulnerable 0 146 102
of 0 146 102
our 0 146 102
diocese. 0 146 102

This 0 146 103
is 0 146 103
a 0 146 103
work 0 146 103
on 0 146 103
which 0 146 103
we 0 146 103
can 0 146 103
never 0 146 103
rest 0 146 103
in 0 146 103
our 0 146 103
vigilance, 0 146 103
nor 0 146 103
our 0 146 103
efforts 0 146 103
to 0 146 103
improve. 0 146 103

We 0 146 104
must 0 146 104
continue 0 146 104
in 0 146 104
our 0 146 104
work 0 146 104
of 0 146 104
education 0 146 104
for 0 146 104
all 0 146 104
and 0 146 104
hold 0 146 104
to 0 146 104
the 0 146 104
effective 0 146 104
policies 0 146 104
that 0 146 104
have 0 146 104
been 0 146 104
implemented, 0 146 104
requiring 0 146 104
psychological 0 146 104
exams 0 146 104
for 0 146 104
all 0 146 104
candidates 0 146 104
for 0 146 104
ministry, 0 146 104
as 0 146 104
well 0 146 104
as 0 146 104
across-the-board 0 146 104
background 0 146 104
checks 0 146 104
for 0 146 104
anyone 0 146 104
working 0 146 104
with 0 146 104
children 0 146 104
or 0 146 104
vulnerable 0 146 104
individuals. 0 146 104

Here 0 146 105
again, 0 146 105
I 0 146 105
state, 0 146 105
as 0 146 105
we 0 146 105
have 0 146 105
done 0 146 105
consistently, 0 146 105
if 0 146 105
you 0 146 105
have 0 146 105
knowledge 0 146 105
of 0 146 105
any 0 146 105
sort 0 146 105
of 0 146 105
criminal 0 146 105
abuse 0 146 105
of 0 146 105
children 0 146 105
by 0 146 105
someone 0 146 105

the 0 146 105
Church, 0 146 105
contact 0 146 105
law 0 146 105
enforcement. 0 146 105

If 0 146 106

If 0 146 107
you 0 146 107
are 0 146 107
an 0 146 107
adult 0 146 107
victim 0 146 107
of 0 146 107
sexual 0 146 107
abuse 0 146 107
from 0 146 107
childhood, 0 146 107
we 0 146 107
still 0 146 107
encourage 0 146 107
you 0 146 107
to 0 146 107

out 0 146 107
to 0 146 107
law 0 146 107
enforcement 0 146 107
first, 0 146 107
but 0 146 107
even 0 146 107
if 0 146 107
you 0 146 107
don’t 0 146 107
want 0 146 107

please 0 146 107
still 0 146 107
reach 0 146 107
out 0 146 107
to 0 146 107
us. 0 146 107

To 0 146 108
our 0 146 108
seminarians: 0 146 108
If 0 146 108
you 0 146 108
are 0 146 108
unchastely 0 146 108
propositioned, 0 146 108
abused, 0 146 108
or 0 146 108
threatened 0 146 108
(no 0 146 108
matter 0 146 108
by 0 146 108
whom), 0 146 108
or 0 146 108
if 0 146 108
you 0 146 108
directly 0 146 108
witness 0 146 108
unchaste 0 146 108
behavior, 0 146 108
report 0 146 108
it 0 146 108
to 0 146 108
me 0 146 108
and 0 146 108
to 0 146 108
the 0 146 108
seminary 0 146 108
rector. 0 146 108

I 0 146 109
will 0 146 109
address 0 146 109
it 0 146 109
swiftly 1 146 109
and 1 146 109
vigorously. 1 146 109

I 1 146 110
will 1 146 110
not 1 146 110
stand 1 146 110
for 1 146 110
this 1 146 110
in 0 146 110
my 0 146 110
diocese 0 146 110
or 0 146 110
anywhere 0 146 110
I 0 146 110
send 0 146 110
men 0 146 110
for 0 146 110
formation. 0 146 110

I 0 146 111
trust 0 146 111
that 0 146 111
the 0 146 111
seminaries 0 146 111
I 0 146 111
choose, 0 146 111
very 0 146 111
discriminately, 0 146 111
to 0 146 111
help 0 146 111
form 0 146 111
our 0 146 111
men 0 146 111
will 0 146 111
not 0 146 111
ignore 0 146 111
this 0 146 111
type 0 146 111
of 0 146 111
scandalous 1 146 111
behavior, 0 146 111
and 0 146 111
I 0 146 111
will 0 146 111
continue 0 146 111
to 0 146 111
verify 0 146 111
that 0 146 111
expectation. 0 146 111

To 0 146 112
our 0 146 112
priests: 0 146 112
Most 0 146 112
simply, 0 146 112
live 0 146 112
out 0 146 112
the 0 146 112
promises 0 146 112
you 0 146 112
made 0 146 112
on 0 146 112
your 0 146 112
ordination 0 146 112
day. 0 146 112

You 0 146 113
are 0 146 113
called 0 146 113
to 0 146 113
serve 0 146 113
Christ’s 0 146 113
people, 0 146 113
beginning 0 146 113
with 0 146 113
praying 0 146 113
daily 0 146 113
the 0 146 113
Liturgy 0 146 113
of 0 146 113
the 0 146 113
Hours. 0 146 113

This 0 146 114
is 0 146 114
to 0 146 114
keep 0 146 114
you 0 146 114
very 0 146 114
close 0 146 114
to 0 146 114
God. 0 146 114

In 0 146 115
addition, 0 146 115
you 0 146 115
promised 0 146 115
to 0 146 115
obey 0 146 115
and 0 146 115
be 0 146 115
loyal 0 146 115
to 0 146 115
your 0 146 115
bishop. 0 146 115

In 0 146 116
obedience, 0 146 116
strive 0 146 116
to 0 146 116
live 0 146 116
out 0 146 116
your 0 146 116
priesthood 0 146 116
as 1 146 116
a 1 146 116
holy 1 146 116
priest, 1 146 116
a 1 146 116
hard 1 146 116
working 1 146 116
priest, 1 146 116
and 1 146 116
a 1 146 116
pure 1 146 116
and 1 146 116
happy 1 146 116
priest 1 146 116
— 0 146 116
as 0 146 116
Christ 0 146 116
Himself 0 146 116
is 0 146 116
calling 0 146 116
you 0 146 116
to 0 146 116
do. 0 146 116

And 0 146 117
by 0 146 117
extension, 0 146 117
live 0 146 117
a 0 146 117
chaste 0 146 117
and 0 146 117
celibate 0 146 117
life 0 146 117
so 0 146 117
that 0 146 117
you 0 146 117
can 0 146 117
completely 0 146 117
give 0 146 117
your 0 146 117
life 0 146 117
to 0 146 117
Christ, 0 146 117
the 0 146 117
Church, 0 146 117
and 0 146 117
the 0 146 117
people 0 146 117
whom 0 146 117
he 0 146 117
has 0 146 117
called 0 146 117
you 0 146 117
to 0 146 117
serve. 0 146 117

God 0 146 118
will 0 146 118
give 0 146 118
you 0 146 118
the 0 146 118
graces 0 146 118
to 0 146 118
do 0 146 118
so. 0 146 118

Ask 0 146 119
Him 0 146 119
for 0 146 119
the 0 146 119
help 0 146 119
you 0 146 119
need 0 146 119
daily 0 146 119
and 0 146 119
throughout 0 146 119

And 0 146 120
if 0 146 120
you 0 146 120
are 0 146 120
unchastely 0 146 120

if 0 146 120
you 0 146 120

report 0 146 120
it 0 146 120
to 0 146 120
me. 0 146 120

I 1 146 121
will 1 146 121
not 1 146 121

this 1 146 121
in 0 146 121
my 0 146 121

To 0 146 122
the 0 146 122
faithful 0 146 122
of 0 146 122
the 0 146 122
diocese: 0 146 122
If 0 146 122
you 0 146 122
are 0 146 122
the 0 146 122
victim 0 146 122
of 0 146 122
abuse 0 146 122
of 0 146 122
any 0 146 122

a 0 146 122

the 0 146 122
Church, 0 146 122
bring 0 146 122
it 0 146 122
forward. 0 146 122

It 0 146 123
will 0 146 123
be 0 146 123
addressed 0 146 123
quickly 0 146 123
and 0 146 123
justly. 0 146 123

If 0 146 124
you 0 146 124
have 0 146 124
directly 0 146 124
witnessed 0 146 124
sexual 0 146 124

or 0 146 124
any 0 146 124

bring 0 146 124
it 0 146 124
forward 0 146 124
as 0 146 124
well. 0 146 124

Such 0 146 125
actions 0 146 125
are 0 146 125
sinful 1 146 125
and 1 146 125
scandalous 1 146 125
and 0 146 125
we 0 146 125
cannot 0 146 125
allow 0 146 125
anyone 0 146 125

Again, 0 146 126
in 0 146 126
addition 0 146 126
to 0 146 126
injuring 0 146 126
individuals, 0 146 126
these 0 146 126
actions 0 146 126
injure 1 146 126
the 1 146 126

Furthermore, 0 146 127
I 0 146 127
add 0 146 127
my 0 146 127

that 0 146 127

out 0 146 127
and 0 146 127
hold 0 146 127
accountable 0 146 127
any 0 146 127

I 0 146 128
will 0 146 128
hold 0 146 128

in 0 146 128
this 0 146 128
regard 0 146 128
will 0 146 128
be 0 146 128
justly 0 146 128
addressed; 0 146 128

I 0 146 129
will 0 146 129
likewise 0 146 129

Failure 1 146 130
to 1 146 130
do 1 146 130
so 1 146 130
will 1 146 130
lead 1 146 130
to 1 146 130
dismissal 1 146 130
from 1 146 130
diocesan 1 146 130

I 0 146 131

I 0 146 133

this 1 146 143
deep 1 146 143
illness 1 146 143
in 1 146 143
the 1 146 143
Church, 1 146 143
but 0 146 143
rather 0 146 143
the 0 146 143
next 0 146 143
steps 0 146 143
I 0 146 143
believe 0 146 143
we 0 146 143
can 0 146 143
take 0 146 143
locally. 0 146 143

More 0 146 144
than 0 146 144
anything 0 146 144
else, 0 146 144
we 0 146 144
as 0 146 144
a 0 146 144
Church 0 146 144
must 0 146 144
cease 0 146 144
our 0 146 144
acceptance 0 146 144
of 0 146 144
sin 0 146 144
and 0 146 144
evil. 0 146 144

We 0 146 145
must 0 146 145
cast 1 146 145
out 1 146 145
sin 1 146 145
from 1 146 145
our 1 146 145
own 1 146 145
lives 1 146 145
and 1 146 145
run 1 146 145
toward 1 146 145
holiness. 1 146 145

We 0 146 146
must 0 146 146
refuse 0 146 146
to 0 146 146
be 0 146 146
silent 0 146 146
in 0 146 146
the 0 146 146
face 0 146 146
of 0 146 146
sin 0 146 146
and 0 146 146
evil 0 146 146
in 0 146 146
our 0 146 146
families 0 146 146
and 0 146 146
communities 0 146 146
and 0 146 146
we 0 146 146
must 0 146 146
demand 0 146 146
from 0 146 146
our 0 146 146
pastors 0 146 146
— 0 146 146
myself 0 146 146
included 0 146 146
— 0 146 146
that 0 146 146
they 0 146 146
themselves 0 146 146
are 0 146 146
striving 0 146 146
day 0 146 146
in 0 146 146
and 0 146 146
day 0 146 146
out 0 146 146
for 0 146 146
holiness. 0 146 146

We 0 146 147
must 0 146 147
do 0 146 147
this 0 146 147
always 0 146 147
with 0 146 147
loving 0 146 147
respect 0 146 147
for 0 146 147
individuals 0 146 147
but 0 146 147
with 0 146 147
a 0 146 147
clear 0 146 147
understanding 0 146 147
that 0 146 147
true 0 146 147
love 0 146 147
can 0 146 147
never 0 146 147
exist 0 146 147
without 0 146 147
truth. 0 146 147

Again, 0 146 148
right 0 146 148
now 0 146 148
there 0 146 148
is 0 146 148
a 0 146 148
lot 0 146 148
of 0 146 148
justified 0 146 148
anger 0 146 148
and 0 146 148
passion 0 146 148
coming 0 146 148
from 0 146 148
many 0 146 148
holy 0 146 148
and 0 146 148
faithful 0 146 148
lay 0 146 148
people 0 146 148
and 0 146 148
clerics 0 146 148
across 0 146 148
the 0 146 148
country, 0 146 148
calling 0 146 148
for 0 146 148
real 0 146 148
reform 0 146 148
and 0 146 148
“house 0 146 148

of 0 146 148
this 0 146 148
type 0 146 148
of 0 146 148
depravity. 0 146 148

I 0 146 149
stand 0 146 149
with 0 146 149
them. 0 146 149

I 0 146 150
don’t 0 146 150
know 0 146 150
yet 0 146 150
how 0 146 150

out 0 146 150
nationally 0 146 150
or 0 146 150
internationally. 0 146 150

But 0 146 151
I 0 146 151
do 0 146 151
know 0 146 151
this, 0 146 151
and 0 146 151
I 0 146 151

on 0 147 6

for 0 147 6
a 0 147 6
global 0 147 6

at 0 147 7
home 0 147 7

increasingly 0 147 7
at 0 147 7
odds 0 147 7
politically 0 147 7
and 0 147 7
economically 0 147 7
with 0 147 7
mainstream 0 147 7
European 0 147 7
Union 0 147 7
peers, 0 147 7
Orban 0 147 7
has 0 147 7
thrived 0 147 7
on 0 147 7
external 0 147 7
controversy, 0 147 7
including 0 147 7
repeated 0 147 7
clashes 0 147 7
with 0 147 7
Brussels 0 147 7
and 0 147 7
lately 0 147 7
the 0 147 7
United 0 147 7
Nations. 0 147 7

Those 0 147 8
conflicts, 0 147 8
mostly 0 147 8
centred 0 147 8
on 0 147 8
migration 0 147 8
since 0 147 8
people 0 147 8

Orban 1 147 8

as 1 147 8
a 1 147 8
saviour 1 147 8
of 1 147 8
Europe's 1 147 8
Christian 1 147 8
nations. 1 147 8

"Christianity 1 147 9
is 1 147 9
Europe's 1 147 9
last 1 147 9
hope," 1 147 9
Orban 0 147 9
told 0 147 9
an 0 147 9
audience 0 147 9
of 0 147 9
party 0 147 9
faithful 0 147 9
at 0 147 9

the 0 147 9
Royal 0 147 9

Budapest. 0 147 9

With 0 147 10
mass 0 147 10
immigration, 0 147 10
especially 0 147 10
from 0 147 10
Africa, 0 147 10
"our 1 147 10
worst 1 147 10
nightmares 1 147 10
can 1 147 10
come 1 147 10
true. 1 147 10

The 1 147 11
West 1 147 11
falls 1 147 11
as 1 147 11
it 1 147 11
fails 1 147 11
to 1 147 11
see 1 147 11
Europe 1 147 11
being 1 147 11
overrun." 1 147 11

Orban 0 147 12
is 0 147 12
widely 0 147 12
credited 0 147 12
for 0 147 12
reversing 0 147 12
an 0 147 12
economic 0 147 12
slump 0 147 12
in 0 147 12
Hungary 0 147 12
and 0 147 12
controlling 0 147 12
its 0 147 12
public 0 147 12
finances, 0 147 12
culminating 0 147 12
in 0 147 12
a 0 147 12
return 0 147 12
to 0 147 12
investment-grade 0 147 12
for 0 147 12
its 0 147 12
debt, 0 147 12
which 0 147 12
was 0 147 12
cut 0 147 12
to 0 147 12
'junk' 0 147 12
during 0 147 12
the 0 147 12
2008 0 147 12
global 0 147 12
economic 0 147 12
crisis. 0 147 12

To 0 147 13
achieve 0 147 13
that 0 147 13
and 0 147 13
hold 0 147 13
onto 0 147 13
power 0 147 13
the 0 147 13
prime 0 147 13
minister, 0 147 13
54, 0 147 13
has 0 147 13
used 0 147 13
methods 0 147 13
that 0 147 13
critics 0 147 13
have 0 147 13
called 0 147 13
authoritarian, 0 147 13
and 0 147 13
picked 0 147 13
fights 0 147 13
with 0 147 13
EU 0 147 13
partners, 0 147 13
especially 0 147 13
in 0 147 13
the 0 147 13
West. 0 147 13

Eastern 0 147 14
leaders, 0 147 14
most 0 147 14
notably 0 147 14
in 0 147 14
Poland, 0 147 14
have 0 147 14
followed 0 147 14
his 0 147 14
lead. 0 147 14

But 0 147 15
migration 0 147 15
dominates 0 147 15
his 0 147 15
agenda 0 147 15
now. 0 147 15

Orban 0 147 16
said 0 147 16
on 0 147 16
Sunday 0 147 16
that 0 147 16
Europe 0 147 16
faces 0 147 16
a 0 147 16
critical 0 147 16
fissure 0 147 16
between 0 147 16
nation 0 147 16
states 0 147 16
of 0 147 16
the 0 147 16
East 0 147 16
and 0 147 16
the 0 147 16
West, 0 147 16
which 0 147 16
he 0 147 16
called 0 147 16
an 0 147 16
"immigrant 0 147 16
zone, 0 147 16
a 0 147 16
mixed 0 147 16
population 0 147 16
world 0 147 16
that 0 147 16
heads 0 147 16
in 0 147 16
a 1 147 16
direction 1 147 16
different 1 147 16
from 1 147 16
ours". 1 147 16

As 0 147 17
the 0 147 17
West 0 147 17
wants 0 147 17
eastern 0 147 17
Europe 0 147 17
to 0 147 17
follow 0 147 17
its 0 147 17
lead, 0 147 17
an 0 147 17
increasingly 1 147 17
vicious 1 147 17
struggle 1 147 17
was 0 147 17
likely, 0 147 17
he 0 147 17
said, 0 147 17
alluding 0 147 17
to 0 147 17
a 0 147 17
plan 0 147 17
to 0 147 17
redraw 0 147 17
the 0 147 17
European 0 147 17
alliance 0 147 17
advocated 0 147 17
by 0 147 17
the 0 147 17
leaders 0 147 17
of 0 147 17
France 0 147 17
and 0 147 17
Germany. 0 147 17

"Absurd 0 147 18
as 0 147 18
it 0 147 18
may 0 147 18
sound 0 147 18
the 1 147 18
danger 1 147 18
we 1 147 18
face 1 147 18
comes 1 147 18
from 1 147 18

from 1 147 18

Orban 0 147 18
said 0 147 18
to 0 147 18
loud 0 147 18
applause. 0 147 18

"Of 0 147 19

Before 0 160 2
I 0 160 2
begin, 0 160 2
I 0 160 2
need 0 160 2
to 0 160 2
make 0 160 2
clear 0 160 2
that 0 160 2
the 0 160 2
best 0 160 2
leaders 0 160 2
are 0 160 2
the 0 160 2

and 0 160 2
that 0 160 2
of 0 160 2
the 0 160 2
Christ 0 160 2
(John 0 160 2
14:6). 0 160 2

With 0 160 3
that 0 160 3
said, 0 160 3
Isn't 0 160 3
it 0 160 3
funny 0 160 3
how 0 160 3
things 0 160 3
work 0 160 3
in 0 160 3
this 0 160 3
world, 0 160 3
it 1 160 3
seems 1 160 3
like 1 160 3
when 1 160 3
you 1 160 3
do 1 160 3
the 1 160 3
wrong 1 160 3
thing 1 160 3
before 1 160 3
God 1 160 3
and 1 160 3
man, 1 160 3
somehow 1 160 3
people 1 160 3
seem 1 160 3
to 1 160 3
give 1 160 3
it 1 160 3
a 1 160 3
pass. 1 160 3

Yet, 1 160 4
when 1 160 4
you 1 160 4
begin 1 160 4
to 1 160 4
do 1 160 4
the 1 160 4
right 1 160 4
things 1 160 4
and 1 160 4
obey 1 160 4
God 1 160 4
and 1 160 4
love 1 160 4
man 1 160 4
according 1 160 4
to 1 160 4
the 1 160 4
Word 1 160 4

all 1 160 4
of 1 160 4
a 1 160 4
sudden, 1 160 4
the 1 160 4
world 1 160 4

you're 1 160 4

I 0 160 19
said, 0 160 19
"Mom, 0 160 19
when 0 160 19

was 0 160 19

anything, 0 160 19

no 0 160 19
one 0 160 19
had 0 160 19
a 0 160 19
problem 0 160 19
with 0 160 19
what 0 160 19
I 0 160 19
was 0 160 19
doing, 0 160 19
that 0 160 19
is 0 160 19
until 0 160 19
I 0 160 19
started 0 160 19
to 0 160 19
emulate 0 160 19
(obey) 0 160 19
Jesus 0 160 19
Christ" 0 160 19
(1 0 160 19
John 0 160 19
2:6). 0 160 19

This 0 160 20
reminds 0 160 20
me 0 160 20
of 0 160 20
when 0 160 20
I 0 160 20
gave 0 160 20
a 0 160 20
prayer 0 160 20
at 0 160 20
the 0 160 20
state 0 160 20
capital 0 160 20
in 0 160 20
Minnesota. 0 160 20

After 0 160 21
the 0 160 21
prayer 0 160 21
was 0 160 21
over, 0 160 21
I 0 160 21
had 0 160 21
a 0 160 21
minister 0 160 21
come 0 160 21
up 0 160 21
to 0 160 21
me 0 160 21
and 0 160 21
tell 0 160 21
me 0 160 21
that 0 160 21
I 0 160 21
could 0 160 21
not 0 160 21
be 0 160 21
dropping 0 160 21
the 0 160 21
“J” 0 160 21
(Jesus) 0 160 21
word 0 160 21
in 0 160 21
the 0 160 21
capital. 0 160 21

I 0 160 22
said 0 160 22
that 0 160 22
the 1 160 22
reason 1 160 22
I 1 160 22
dropped 1 160 22
the 1 160 22
“J” 1 160 22
word 1 160 22
was 1 160 22
because 1 160 22
you 1 160 22
haven’t 1 160 22
in 1 160 22
40 1 160 22

high 0 160 23
schools 0 160 23
across 0 160 23

we 0 160 23
have 0 160 23
been 0 160 23
going 0 160 23
into 0 160 23

who 0 160 23
we 0 160 23
are, 0 160 23

not 0 160 23
what 0 160 23
the 1 160 23
revisionists 1 160 23

propagandists 1 160 23
would 0 160 23
have 0 160 23
them 0 160 23
believe 0 160 23
that 0 160 23
we 0 160 23
are. 0 160 23

We 0 160 24
have 0 160 24
shown 0 160 24
the 0 160 24
young 0 160 24
people 0 160 24
that 0 160 24
abortion 1 160 24
is 1 160 24
murder 1 160 24
and 1 160 24
that 1 160 24
58 1 160 24
million 1 160 24
babies 1 160 24
have 1 160 24
been 1 160 24

1973 1 160 24
under 1 160 24
the 1 160 24
guise 1 160 24
of 1 160 24
woman’s 1 160 24
choice 1 160 24
(Proverbs 0 160 24
6:17). 0 160 24

We 1 160 25
got 1 160 25
kicked 1 160 25
out 1 160 25
of 1 160 25
a 1 160 25
public 1 160 25
school 1 160 25
for 1 160 25
re-enforcing 1 160 25
America’s 1 160 25
value’s 1 160 25
by 1 160 25
teaching 1 160 25
the 1 160 25
US 1 160 25
Constitution. 1 160 25

We 0 160 26
have 0 160 26
taught 0 160 26
that 0 160 26
homosexuality 1 160 26
is 1 160 26
an 1 160 26
abomination, 1 160 26
and 0 160 26
how 0 160 26
it 0 160 26
is 0 160 26
a 0 160 26
felony 0 160 26
in 0 160 26
every 0 160 26
state 0 160 26
in 0 160 26
our 0 160 26
union 0 160 26
(Leviticus 0 160 26
18:22; 0 160 26
20:13; 0 160 26
Jude 0 160 26
1:7). 0 160 26

How 0 160 27
true 0 160 27
Scripture 0 160 27
is 0 160 27
when 0 160 27
it 0 160 27
declares: 0 160 27

“Woe 0 160 28
unto 0 160 28
them 0 160 28
that 0 160 28
call 0 160 28
evil 0 160 28
good, 0 160 28
and 0 160 28
good 0 160 28
evil; 0 160 28
that 0 160 28
put 0 160 28
darkness 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
light, 0 160 28
and 0 160 28
light 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
darkness; 0 160 28
that 0 160 28
put 0 160 28
bitter 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
sweet, 0 160 28
and 0 160 28
sweet 0 160 28
for 0 160 28
bitter!" 0 160 28

No 0 160 29
wonder 0 160 29
why 0 160 29
the 1 160 29
reprobates 1 160 29
and 1 160 29
hypocrites 1 160 29
thought 0 160 29
that 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
Christians 0 160 29
who 0 160 29
were 0 160 29
following 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
living 0 160 29
Christ 0 160 29
were 0 160 29
turning 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
world 0 160 29
upside 0 160 29
down 0 160 29
in 0 160 29
the 0 160 29
book 0 160 29
of 0 160 29
Acts. 0 160 29

They 0 160 30
were, 0 160 30
in 0 160 30
fact, 0 160 30
turning 0 160 30
the 0 160 30
world 0 160 30
right 0 160 30
side 0 160 30
up 0 160 30
(Acts 0 160 30
17:6). 0 160 30

the 0 160 31
genuine 0 160 31
from 0 160 31
the 0 160 31
counterfeit 0 160 31

Last 0 160 32
week, 0 160 32
I 0 160 32
had 0 160 32
a 0 160 32
woman 0 160 32
come 0 160 32
up 0 160 32
to 0 160 32
me 0 160 32
at 0 160 32
my 0 160 32
last 0 160 32
meeting 0 160 32
in 0 160 32
Amery, 0 160 32
Wisconsin. 0 160 32

She 0 160 33
said 0 160 33
that 0 160 33
she 0 160 33
did 0 160 33
her 0 160 33
research 0 160 33
on 0 160 33
me 0 160 33
and 0 160 33
said 0 160 33
that 0 160 33
the 0 160 33
media 0 160 33
really 0 160 33
attacked 0 160 33
me. 0 160 33

I 0 160 34
responded 0 160 34
with, 0 160 34
"Of 1 160 34
course 1 160 34
they 1 160 34
did, 1 160 34
and 1 160 34
of 1 160 34
course 1 160 34
they 1 160 34
still 1 160 34
do." 1 160 34

They 1 160 35
are 1 160 35
being 1 160 35
exposed 1 160 35
for 1 160 35
who 1 160 35
they 1 160 35
are 1 160 35
and 1 160 35
they 1 160 35
do 1 160 35
not 1 160 35
like 1 160 35
it. 1 160 35

(John 0 160 36
15:22). 0 160 36

I 0 160 37
told 0 160 37
her 0 160 37
that 0 160 37
there 0 160 37
are 0 160 37
too 0 160 37
many 0 160 37
counterfeits, 1 160 37
self-proclaimed 1 160 37
leaders, 1 160 37
out 0 160 37
there 0 160 37
who 1 160 37
care 1 160 37
more 1 160 37
about 1 160 37
saving 1 160 37
face, 1 160 37
than 1 160 37
they 1 160 37
do 1 160 37
the 1 160 37
souls 1 160 37
of 1 160 37
men 1 160 37
(Luke 1 160 37
19:10), 1 160 37
as 1 160 37
well 1 160 37
as 1 160 37
saving 1 160 37
their 1 160 37
country. 1 160 37

Apparently 0 160 38
they 0 160 38
have 0 160 38
a 0 160 38
reputation 0 160 38
to 0 160 38
keep 0 160 38
up. 0 160 38

the 0 160 40
status 0 160 40
of 0 160 40
some 0 160 40
sort 0 160 40
of 0 160 40
church 0 160 40
or 0 160 40
political 1 160 40
leader 1 160 40
of 1 160 40
the 1 160 40
pack. 1 160 40

Yet, 1 160 41
you 1 160 41
do 1 160 41
not 1 160 41
see 1 160 41
any 1 160 41
warfare 1 160 41
or 1 160 41
opposition 1 160 41
around 1 160 41
them 1 160 41
and 1 160 41
why? 1 160 41

because 1 160 42
they 1 160 42
have 1 160 42
simply 1 160 42
forsaken 1 160 42
the 1 160 42
cross. 1 160 42

There 0 160 43
is 0 160 43
no 0 160 43
absolutes 0 160 43
with 0 160 43
these 0 160 43
people. 0 160 43

They 1 160 44
are 1 160 44
people 1 160 44
pleasers 1 160 44
and 1 160 44
nothing 1 160 44
more. 1 160 44

After 0 160 45
all 0 160 45
you 0 160 45
can 0 160 45
always 0 160 45
tell 0 160 45
what 0 160 45
a 0 160 45
man 0 160 45
stands 0 160 45
for 0 160 45
by 0 160 45
the 0 160 45
enemies 0 160 45
that 0 160 45
he 0 160 45
has. 0 160 45

They 0 160 46
hide 1 160 46
behind 1 160 46
a 1 160 46
microphone 1 160 46
day 0 160 46
after 0 160 46
day. 0 160 46

Yet, 0 160 47
they 0 160 47
fail 0 160 47
to 0 160 47
confront 0 160 47
the 0 160 47
issues 0 160 47
that 0 160 47
needed 0 160 47
to 0 160 47
be 0 160 47
confronted. 0 160 47

The 1 160 48
reason 1 160 48
they 1 160 48
don't 1 160 48
is 1 160 48
because 1 160 48
they 1 160 48
are 1 160 48
guilty 1 160 48
of 1 160 48
what 1 160 48
they 1 160 48
fail 1 160 48
to 1 160 48
confront! 1 160 48

They 0 160 49
are 0 160 49
paper 1 160 49
tigers. 1 160 49

They 1 160 50
can 1 160 50
write 1 160 50
all 1 160 50
big 1 160 50
and 1 160 50
bad 1 160 50
but 1 160 50
when 1 160 50
it 1 160 50
comes 1 160 50
to 1 160 50
what 1 160 50
someone 1 160 50
else 1 160 50
should 1 160 50
do. 1 160 50

However, 1 160 51
when 1 160 51
it 1 160 51
is 1 160 51
time 1 160 51
for 1 160 51
them 1 160 51
to 1 160 51
put 1 160 51
boots 1 160 51
on 1 160 51
the 1 160 51
ground, 1 160 51
they 1 160 51
are 1 160 51
simply 1 160 51
missing 1 160 51
in 1 160 51
action 1 160 51
(MIA). 1 160 51

These 0 160 52
are 0 160 52
willing 0 160 52
to 1 160 52
live 1 160 52
in 1 160 52
the 1 160 52
freest 1 160 52
country 1 160 52
in 1 160 52
the 1 160 52
world 1 160 52
as 0 160 52
long 0 160 52
as 0 160 52
it 0 160 52
is 0 160 52
not 0 160 52
them 0 160 52
that 0 160 52
have 0 160 52
to 0 160 52
sacrifice 0 160 52
to 0 160 52
maintain 0 160 52
it. 0 160 52

There 0 160 53
is 0 160 53
also 0 160 53
a 0 160 53
group 0 160 53
of 0 160 53
people 0 160 53
out 0 160 53
there 0 160 53
that 0 160 53
have 0 160 53
to 0 160 53
be 0 160 53
friends 0 160 53
with 0 160 53
everyone 0 160 53
(and 0 160 53
have 0 160 53
to 0 160 53
apologize 0 160 53
to 0 160 53
any 0 160 53
that 0 160 53
they 0 160 53
may 0 160 53
have 0 160 53
told 0 160 53
the 0 160 53
truth 0 160 53
lest 0 160 53
they 0 160 53
should 0 160 53
convict 1 160 53
them 1 160 53
unto 1 160 53
godly 1 160 53
repentance 1 160 53
(2 0 160 53
Corinthians 0 160 53
7:10) 0 160 53
as 0 160 53
they 0 160 53
congregate 0 160 53
week 0 160 53
after 0 160 53
week 0 160 53
deceiving 1 160 53
themselves 1 160 53
into 1 160 53
believing 1 160 53
that 1 160 53
they 1 160 53
are 1 160 53
demanding 1 160 53
a 1 160 53
lawful 1 160 53
change 1 160 53
just 1 160 53
as 1 160 53
long 1 160 53
as 1 160 53
it 1 160 53
does 1 160 53
not 1 160 53
offend 1 160 53
anyone 1 160 53
(Matthew 0 160 53
5:10). 0 160 53

As 0 160 54
a 0 160 54
matter 0 160 54
of 0 160 54
fact, 0 160 54
these 1 160 54
counterfeits 1 160 54
will 1 160 54
be 1 160 54
the 1 160 54
first 1 160 54
ones 1 160 54
to 1 160 54
get 1 160 54
angry 1 160 54
with 1 160 54
and 1 160 54
denounce 1 160 54
and 1 160 54
attack 1 160 54
the 1 160 54
ones 1 160 54
that 1 160 54
are 1 160 54
sent 1 160 54
by 1 160 54
the 1 160 54
Spirit 1 160 54
of 1 160 54
God 1 160 54
(Galatians 0 160 54
4:29). 0 160 54

Maybe 0 160 55
this 0 160 55
group 0 160 55
of 0 160 55
people 0 160 55
should 0 160 55
ask 0 160 55
their 0 160 55
enemies 0 160 55
for 0 160 55
instructions 0 160 55
as 0 160 55
to 0 160 55
how 0 160 55
change 0 160 55
is 0 160 55
brought 0 160 55
about, 0 160 55
and 0 160 55
in 1 160 55
a 1 160 55
righteous 1 160 55
sense 1 160 55
reverse 1 160 55
the 1 160 55
lawlessness-taking 1 160 55
place 0 160 55
in 0 160 55
this 0 160 55
country 0 160 55
(Matthew 0 160 55
24:12). 0 160 55

These 1 160 56
groups 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
people 1 160 56
are 1 160 56
simply 1 160 56
enemies 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
the 1 160 56
cross 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
Christ 1 160 56
and 1 160 56
know 1 160 56
not 1 160 56
the 1 160 56
power 1 160 56
of 1 160 56
God 1 160 56
unto 1 160 56
salvation 1 160 56
(Philippians 0 160 56
3:18). 0 160 56

Furthermore, 0 160 57
I 0 160 57
said 0 160 57
to 0 160 57
this 0 160 57
woman 0 160 57
that 0 160 57
this 0 160 57
is 0 160 57
how 0 160 57
you 0 160 57
can 0 160 57
tell 0 160 57
who 0 160 57
the 1 160 57
genuine 1 160 57
Christians 1 160 57
are 0 160 57
that 0 160 57
are 0 160 57
in 0 160 57
the 0 160 57
fight 0 160 57
and 0 160 57
those 1 160 57
who 1 160 57
are 1 160 57
counterfeits. 1 160 57

When 0 160 58
the 0 160 58
church 0 160 58
and 0 160 58
the 0 160 58
world 0 160 58
can 0 160 58
jog 1 160 58
comfortably 1 160 58
along 1 160 58
together, 1 160 58
you 0 160 58
can 0 160 58
be 0 160 58
sure 0 160 58
something 0 160 58
is 0 160 58
wrong. 0 160 58

The 0 160 59
world 0 160 59
has 0 160 59
not 0 160 59
compromised—its 0 160 59
spirit 0 160 59
is 0 160 59
exactly 0 160 59
the 0 160 59
same 0 160 59
as 0 160 59
it 0 160 59
ever 0 160 59
was. 0 160 59

If 1 160 60
Christians 1 160 60
were 1 160 60
equally 1 160 60
as 1 160 60
faithful 1 160 60
to 1 160 60
the 1 160 60
Lord, 1 160 60
separated 1 160 60
from 1 160 60
the 1 160 60
world 1 160 60
(2 1 160 60
Corinthians 1 160 60
6:17), 1 160 60
and 1 160 60
living 1 160 60
so 1 160 60
that 1 160 60
their 1 160 60
lives 1 160 60
were 1 160 60
a 1 160 60
reproof 1 160 60
to 1 160 60
all 1 160 60
ungodliness, 1 160 60
the 1 160 60

would 1 160 60
hate 1 160 60
them 1 160 60
as 1 160 60
much 1 160 60
as 1 160 60
it 1 160 60
ever 1 160 60
did. 1 160 60

An 0 164 1
outbreak 0 164 1
of 0 164 1
the 0 164 1
plague 0 164 1
in 0 164 1
Madagascar 0 164 1
is 0 164 1
spreading 0 164 1
at 0 164 1
an 0 164 1
unprecedented 1 164 1
rate. 0 164 1

With 0 164 2
the 0 164 2
ease 0 164 2
of 0 164 2
spreading 0 164 2
the 0 164 2
plague, 0 164 2
the 1 164 2
likelihood 1 164 2
that 1 164 2
this 1 164 2
disease 1 164 2
will 1 164 2
move 1 164 2
to 1 164 2

the 1 164 2
planet 1 164 2
has 1 164 2
become 1 164 2
a 1 164 2
huge 1 164 2
concern 1 164 2
for 1 164 2
many. 1 164 2

So 0 164 3
far, 0 164 3
the 0 164 3
plague 0 164 3
has 0 164 3
claimed 0 164 3
57 0 164 3
lives 0 164 3
and 0 164 3
infected 0 164 3
more 0 164 3
than 0 164 3
680 0 164 3
others. 0 164 3

These 0 164 4

however, 0 164 4
and 0 164 4
the 0 164 4

Of 0 164 8
Madagascar’s 0 164 8
114 0 164 8
districts, 0 164 8
35 0 164 8
have 0 164 8
reported 0 164 8
cases 0 164 8
of 0 164 8
plague, 0 164 8
including 0 164 8
at 0 164 8
least 0 164 8
10 0 164 8
cities. 0 164 8

Plague 0 164 9
is 0 164 9
caused 0 164 9
by 0 164 9
infection 0 164 9
with 0 164 9
the 0 164 9
bacterium 0 164 9
Yersinia 0 164 9
pestis 0 164 9
and 0 164 9
is 0 164 9
typically 0 164 9

through 0 164 9
the 0 164 9

fleas, 0 164 9
frequently 0 164 9
carried 0 164 9
by 0 164 9
rats. 0 164 9

The 0 164 10
bacteria 0 164 10
will 0 164 10
eventually 0 164 10
end 0 164 10
up 0 164 10
causing 0 164 10
the 0 164 10
often 0 164 10
fatal 0 164 10
plague. 0 164 10

Symptoms 0 164 11
can 0 164 11
include 0 164 11
painful, 0 164 11
swollen 0 164 11

well 0 164 11
as 0 164 11
fever, 0 164 11
chills, 0 164 11
and 0 164 11
coughing. 0 164 11

Pneumonic 0 164 12
plague 0 164 12
is 0 164 12

The 0 164 13
infection 0 164 13
can 0 164 13
be 0 164 13
transmitted 0 164 13
from 0 164 13

from 0 164 13
coughing 0 164 13
or 0 164 13

The 0 164 14
incubation 0 164 14
period 0 164 14
is 0 164 14
extremely 1 164 14

too, 0 164 14
and 0 164 14
an 0 164 14

According 0 164 15
to 0 164 15
CNN, 0 164 15
the 0 164 15
cases 0 164 15
were 0 164 15
reported 0 164 15

They 0 164 16
include 0 164 16
probable 0 164 16
and 0 164 16
suspected 0 164 16
cases 0 164 16
as 0 164 16

been 0 164 16
confirmed 0 164 16
by 0 164 16
laboratory 0 164 16

And 0 164 17
while 0 164 17
the 0 164 17
country 0 164 17
experiences 0 164 17
regular 0 164 17
outbreaks, 0 164 17
with 0 164 17
an 0 164 17
estimated 0 164 17
400 0 164 17
cases 0 164 17
of 0 164 17
plague 0 164 17
each 0 164 17
year, 0 164 17
this 0 164 17
time 0 164 17
things 0 164 17
are 0 164 17
very 0 164 17
different, 0 164 17
experts 0 164 17
warn. 0 164 17

This 0 164 18
year, 0 164 18
health 0 164 18
officials 0 164 18
report 0 164 18
the 0 164 18
infections 0 164 18
started 0 164 18
much 0 164 18
earlier 0 164 18
than 0 164 18
usual, 0 164 18
and 0 164 18
they’re 0 164 18
occurring 0 164 18
in 0 164 18
new 0 164 18
areas, 0 164 18
including 0 164 18
urban 0 164 18
settings. 0 164 18

They’ve 0 164 19
also 0 164 19
seen 0 164 19
an 0 164 19
unexpected 0 164 19
number 0 164 19
of 0 164 19
cases 0 164 19
of 0 164 19
pneumonic 0 164 19
plague, 0 164 19
which 0 164 19
transmits 0 164 19
more 0 164 19
easily 0 164 19
from 0 164 19
person 0 164 19

person. 0 164 19

Historically 0 164 20
dubbed 0 164 20
the 0 164 20
“black 1 164 20
death” 1 164 20
the 0 164 20
bubonic 0 164 20
plague 0 164 20
has 0 164 20
been 0 164 20
responsible 0 164 20
for 0 164 20
several 0 164 20
worldwide 0 164 20
pandemics 0 164 20
in 0 164 20
the 0 164 20
past. 0 164 20

Early 0 164 21
detection 0 164 21
of 0 164 21
the 0 164 21
plague 0 164 21
is 0 164 21
key 0 164 21
since 0 164 21
both 0 164 21
forms 0 164 21
of 0 164 21
it 0 164 21
can 0 164 21
be 0 164 21
cured 0 164 21
with 0 164 21
antibiotics. 0 164 21

But, 0 164 22
occasionally 0 164 22
there 0 164 22
can 0 164 22
be 0 164 22
cases 0 164 22
of 0 164 22
septicemic 0 164 22
plague, 0 164 22
where 0 164 22
the 0 164 22
infection 0 164 22
has 0 164 22
spread 0 164 22
to 0 164 22
a 0 164 22
person’s 0 164 22
bloodstream 0 164 22
and 0 164 22
can 0 164 22
cause 0 164 22
bleeding 0 164 22
and 0 164 22
necrosis 0 164 22
of 0 164 22
tissue, 0 164 22
turning 0 164 22
it 0 164 22
black. 0 164 22

Internationally, 0 164 23
this 0 164 23
outbreak 0 164 23

also 0 164 23
being 0 164 23

Pompeo 0 166 7
reminded 0 166 7
his 0 166 7
hosts 0 166 7
that 0 166 7
despite 0 166 7
the 0 166 7
numerous 0 166 7
bilateral 0 166 7
issues 0 166 7
the 0 166 7
two 0 166 7
governments 0 166 7
share, 0 166 7
determining 0 166 7
Khashoggi’s 0 166 7
fate 0 166 7
was 0 166 7
the 0 166 7
urgent 0 166 7
purpose 0 166 7
of 0 166 7
this 0 166 7
trip, 0 166 7
she 0 166 7
said. 0 166 7

Khashoggi, 0 166 8
a 0 166 8
prominent 0 166 8
critic 0 166 8
of 0 166 8
the 0 166 8
autocratic 0 166 8
Saudi 0 166 8
leadership, 0 166 8
was 0 166 8
last 0 166 8
seen 0 166 8
entering 0 166 8
the 0 166 8
Saudi 0 166 8
Consulate 0 166 8
in 0 166 8
Istanbul, 0 166 8
Turkey, 0 166 8
on 0 166 8
Oct. 0 166 8

where 0 166 8
he 0 166 8
was 0 166 8
seeking 0 166 8
papers 0 166 8

marry 0 166 8

Turkish 0 166 9
media 0 166 9
reports, 0 166 9
based 0 166 9
in 0 166 9
part 0 166 9
on 0 166 9
apparent 0 166 9
audio 0 166 9
recordings, 0 166 9
have 0 166 9
said 0 166 9
Khashoggi 0 166 9
was 0 166 9
beaten 1 166 9
to 1 166 9
death 1 166 9
and 1 166 9
then 1 166 9
dismembered 1 166 9
in 0 166 9
the 0 166 9
building. 0 166 9

A 0 166 10
15-member 0 166 10
Saudi 0 166 10
military 0 166 10
team 0 166 10
had 0 166 10
entered 0 166 10
the 0 166 10
consulate 0 166 10
with 0 166 10
a 0 166 10
bone 0 166 10
saw 0 166 10
shortly 0 166 10
before 0 166 10
Khashoggi 0 166 10
arrived, 0 166 10
and 0 166 10
flew 0 166 10
out 0 166 10
of 0 166 10
the 0 166 10
country 0 166 10
soon 0 166 10
after, 0 166 10
the 0 166 10
reports 0 166 10
said. 0 166 10

Saudi 0 166 11
officials 0 166 11
insisted 0 166 11
that 0 166 11
Khashoggi 0 166 11
left 0 166 11
the 0 166 11
consulate 0 166 11
but 0 166 11
have 0 166 11
provided 0 166 11
no 0 166 11
video 0 166 11
or 0 166 11
other 0 166 11
evidence. 0 166 11

They 0 166 12
have 0 166 12
denied 0 166 12
any 0 166 12
responsibility 0 166 12
for 0 166 12
his 0 166 12
disappearance. 0 166 12

Hoping 0 166 13
to 0 166 13
stem 0 166 13
a 0 166 13
growing 0 166 13
furor, 0 166 13
Trump 0 166 13
on 0 166 13
Monday 0 166 13
suggested 0 166 13
“rogue 0 166 13
killers,” 0 166 13
not 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
Saudi 0 166 13
royal 0 166 13
family, 0 166 13
may 0 166 13
have 0 166 13
carried 0 166 13
out 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
murder. 0 166 13

Critics 0 166 14
quickly 0 166 14
said 0 166 14
that 0 166 14
Trump 0 166 14
was 0 166 14
providing 0 166 14
an 0 166 14
excuse 0 166 14
for 0 166 14
the 0 166 14
Saudi 0 166 14
leaders, 0 166 14
and 0 166 14
participating 0 166 14
in 0 166 14
a 0 166 14
cover-up. 0 166 14

That 0 166 15
seemed 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
set 0 166 15
the 0 166 15
stage 0 166 15
for 0 166 15
Saudi 0 166 15
officials 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
find 0 166 15
a 0 166 15
way 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
explain 0 166 15
away 0 166 15
the 0 166 15
alleged 0 166 15
shocking 1 166 15
death. 1 166 15

They 0 166 16
floated 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
idea 0 166 16
later 0 166 16
Monday 0 166 16
of 0 166 16
claiming 0 166 16
that 0 166 16
Khashoggi, 0 166 16
who 0 166 16
wrote 0 166 16
opinion 0 166 16
pieces 0 166 16
for 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
Washington 0 166 16
Post 0 166 16
and 0 166 16
Arab 0 166 16
media, 0 166 16
was 0 166 16
accidentally 0 166 16
killed 0 166 16
in 0 166 16
an 0 166 16
interrogation 0 166 16
gone 0 166 16
awry 0 166 16
inside 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
consulate 0 166 16
— 0 166 16
supposedly 0 166 16
without 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
approval 0 166 16
of 0 166 16
the 0 166 16
king 0 166 16
or 0 166 16
crown 0 166 16
prince. 0 166 16

Publicly, 0 166 17
Pompeo 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
his 0 166 17
hosts 0 166 17
looked 0 166 17
calm 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
friendly 0 166 17
when 0 166 17
they 0 166 17
met 0 166 17
Tuesday 0 166 17
in 0 166 17
Riyadh. 0 166 17

At 0 166 18
one 0 166 18
point, 0 166 18
as 0 166 18
they 0 166 18
greeted 0 166 18
each 0 166 18
other, 0 166 18
Prince 0 166 18
Mohammed 0 166 18
noted 0 166 18
the 0 166 18
two 0 166 18
countries 0 166 18
were 0 166 18
important 0 166 18
allies. 0 166 18

“Absolutely,” 0 166 19
Pompeo 0 166 19
said, 0 166 19
smiling. 0 166 19

The 0 166 20
United 0 166 20
States 0 166 20
long 0 166 20
guaranteed 0 166 20
Saudi 0 166 20
security 0 166 20
in 0 166 20
exchange 0 166 20
for 0 166 20
a 0 166 20
steady 0 166 20
supply 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
oil. 0 166 20

Those 0 166 21
ties 0 166 21
have 0 166 21
frayed 0 166 21
even 0 166 21
as 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
Trump 0 166 21
administration 0 166 21
has 0 166 21
embraced 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
Saudi 0 166 21
rulers 0 166 21
as 0 166 21
a 0 166 21
crucial 0 166 21
regional 0 166 21
ally 0 166 21
in 0 166 21
efforts 0 166 21
to 0 166 21
constrain 0 166 21
Iran 0 166 21
and 0 166 21
to 0 166 21
craft 0 166 21
a 0 166 21
peace 0 166 21
plan 0 166 21
between 0 166 21
Israel 0 166 21
and 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
Palestinians. 0 166 21

The 0 166 22
current 0 166 22
crisis 0 166 22
has 0 166 22
put 0 166 22
those 0 166 22
broader 0 166 22
goals 0 166 22
at 0 166 22
risk, 0 166 22
and 0 166 22
the 0 166 22
White 0 166 22
House 0 166 22
has 0 166 22
scrambled 0 166 22
to 0 166 22
find 0 166 22
a 0 166 22
face-saving 0 166 22
solution 0 166 22
for 0 166 22
the 0 166 22
Saudi 0 166 22
rulers. 0 166 22

Trump 0 166 23
has 0 166 23
said 0 166 23
he 0 166 23
would 0 166 23
impose 0 166 23
“severe” 1 166 23
punishment 0 166 23
if 0 166 23
proof 0 166 23
emerges 0 166 23
that 0 166 23
Saudi 0 166 23
rulers 0 166 23
sanctioned 0 166 23
Khashoggi’s 0 166 23
murder, 0 166 23
but 0 166 23
he 0 166 23
has 0 166 23
not 0 166 23
said 0 166 23
what 0 166 23
that 0 166 23
would 0 166 23
entail. 0 166 23

He 0 166 24
has 0 166 24
ruled 0 166 24
out 0 166 24
cancelling 0 166 24
or 0 166 24
suspending 0 166 24

deals 0 166 24
with 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
oil-rich 0 166 24
country. 0 166 24

Many 0 166 25
members 0 166 25
of 0 166 25
Congress 0 166 25
have 0 166 25
demanded 0 166 25
the 0 166 25
White 0 166 25
House 0 166 25
take 0 166 25
tougher 0 166 25
actions, 0 166 25
including 0 166 25
punitive 0 166 25
sanctions 0 166 25
on 0 166 25
Saudi 0 166 25
rulers. 0 166 25

But 0 166 26
Congress 0 166 26
has 0 166 26
taken 0 166 26
no 0 166 26

January 0 168 16
2017 0 168 16
President 0 168 16

over 0 168 16
a 0 168 16
labor 0 168 16
market 0 168 16
in 0 168 16
which 0 168 16
immigrants 0 168 16

gained 0 168 16
1.006 0 168 16

while 0 168 16

—a 0 168 16

of 0 168 16
only 0 168 16
1.9%. 0 168 16

As 0 168 17
far 0 168 17
as 0 168 17
the 0 168 17
labor 0 168 17
market 0 168 17
is 0 168 17
concerned, 0 168 17
“America 1 168 17

has 0 168 17
not 0 168 17
translated 0 168 17
to 0 168 17
Americans 0 168 17
First. 0 168 17

In 0 168 18
normal 0 168 18
times, 0 168 18
this 0 168 18
might 0 168 18
be 0 168 18
a 0 168 18
big 0 168 18
story. 0 168 18

But 0 168 19
the 0 168 19
even 0 168 19
the 1 168 19
conservative 1 168 19

currently 0 168 19

steeped 1 168 19

economic 1 168 19

to 0 168 19
notice. 0 168 19

Nd 0 168 20
anyway, 0 168 20
they 0 168 20
almost 0 168 20
never 0 168 20
report 0 168 20
the 0 168 20
immigration 0 168 20
dimension. 0 168 20

However, 0 168 21
it 0 168 21
is 0 168 21
now 0 168 21
absolutely 0 168 21
clear 0 168 21
that 0 168 21
immigration, 0 168 21
and 0 168 21
immigrant 0 168 21

jawboned 1 168 21

The 1 168 22
only 1 168 22

is 1 168 22
legislation— 1 168 22

you 0 172 2

this 0 172 2

that 0 172 2
are 0 172 2
deeply 1 172 2
disturbing, 1 172 2
but 0 172 2
it 0 172 2
is 0 172 2
for 0 172 2
a 0 172 2

The 0 172 3
status 0 172 3

not 0 172 3
acceptable 0 172 3
in 0 172 3
Washington, 0 172 3
and 1 172 3
once 1 172 3
people 1 172 3
truly 1 172 3
understand 1 172 3
how 1 172 3
deep 1 172 3
the 1 172 3
corruaption 1 172 3
runs 1 172 3
I 1 172 3
believe 1 172 3
that 1 172 3
they 1 172 3
will 1 172 3
get 1 172 3
motivated 1 172 3

finally 1 172 3

truly 1 172 4
disgusting, 1 172 4
but 0 172 4
the 0 172 4
goal 0 172 4
is 0 172 4
to 0 172 4
show 0 172 4
you 0 172 4
that 0 172 4
it 1 172 4
is 1 172 4
time 1 172 4
to 1 172 4
take 1 172 4
our 1 172 4
government 1 172 4
back 1 172 4
from 1 172 4
the 1 172 4
corrupt 1 172 4

that 1 172 4

out 1 172 4

CNN 0 172 6
spoke 0 172 6
with 0 172 6
more 0 172 6
than 0 172 6
50 0 172 6

current 0 172 6
and 0 172 6
former 0 172 6

who 0 172 6
have 0 172 6

anonymously 0 172 6
to 0 172 6

candid 0 172 6
and 0 172 6
avoid 0 172 6
potential 0 172 6
repercussions. 0 172 6

With 0 172 7
few 0 172 7
exceptions, 0 172 7
every 0 172 7
person 0 172 7
said 0 172 7
they 0 172 7
have 0 172 7

or 0 172 7
know 0 172 7
of 0 172 7
others 0 172 7
who 0 172 7
have. 0 172 7

In 0 172 8
an 0 172 8
environment 0 172 8
with 0 172 8
“so 0 172 8
many 0 172 8
young 0 172 8
women,” 0 172 8
said 0 172 8
one 0 172 8
ex-House 0 172 8

the 1 172 8
men 1 172 8
“have 1 172 8
no 1 172 8
self-control.” 1 172 8
“Amongst 0 172 8
ourselves, 0 172 8
we 0 172 8
know,” 0 172 8
a 0 172 8
former 0 172 8
Senate 0 172 8
staffer 0 172 8
said 0 172 8
of 0 172 8
the 0 172 8

with 0 172 8
the 0 172 8

And 0 172 9
sometimes, 0 172 9
the 0 172 9
sexual 0 172 9

from 0 172 9

Congress 0 172 9

reciprocated 0 172 9
in 0 172 9
the 0 172 9
hopes 0 172 9
of 0 172 9
advancing 0 172 9
one’s 0 172 9
career 0 172 9
— 0 172 9
what 0 172 9
one 0 172 9
political 0 172 9
veteran 0 172 9
bluntly 0 172 9
referred 0 172 9
to 0 172 9

a 0 172 9
“sex 1 172 9

The 1 172 10
American 1 172 10
people 1 172 10
are 1 172 10
not 1 172 10
going 1 172 10

up 1 172 10
with 1 172 10
this 1 172 10
any 1 172 10
longer. 1 172 10

We 1 172 11
have 1 172 11
no 1 172 11
choice 1 172 11
but 1 172 11
to 1 172 11
clean 1 172 11
up 1 172 11
our 1 172 11
government 1 172 11

the 1 172 11

the 1 172 11

the 0 172 30

It 0 172 31

Of 0 172 35
course, 0 172 35
this 0 172 35
sort 0 172 35
of 0 172 35

is 0 172 35

An 0 172 37
ex-Secret 0 172 37

that 0 172 37

completely 1 172 37

spoke 0 172 38
on 0 172 38
condition 0 172 38
of 0 172 38
anonymity 0 172 38

“would 1 172 38
mess 1 172 38
with 1 172 38
every 1 172 38

that 0 172 38
a 0 172 38

at 0 172 38
the 0 172 38
VP’s 0 172 38
house 0 172 38
had 0 172 38
to 0 172 38
be 0 172 38
canceled 0 172 38
“because 0 172 38
Biden 0 172 38

In 0 172 39
fact, 0 172 39
things 0 172 39
were 0 172 39
so 0 172 39
bad 0 172 39
that 0 172 39
at 0 172 39
one 0 172 39

a 0 172 39

got 0 172 39
into 0 172 39

with 0 172 39

incident 0 172 41
in 0 172 41
2009, 0 172 41
Biden 0 172 41
cupped 0 172 41
the 0 172 41
breast 0 172 41
of 0 172 41
a 0 172 41
Secret 0 172 41
Service 0 172 41
agent’s 0 172 41
girlfriend 0 172 41
during 0 172 41
a 0 172 41

prompting 0 172 41
the 0 172 41

shove 0 172 41
Biden 0 172 41
and 0 172 41
almost 0 172 41
hit 0 172 41
him. 0 172 41

The 0 172 42

a 0 172 42

according 0 172 42
to 0 172 42
the 0 172 42

Men 0 172 43

stand 0 172 43

false 0 172 43

When 0 172 44
I 0 172 44
am 0 172 44
elected 0 172 44
to 0 172 44
Congress, 0 172 44

We 1 172 45

the 1 172 45
rest 1 172 45

the 1 172 45

instead, 1 172 45
we 1 172 45
have 1 172 45
become 1 172 45
a 1 172 45

original 0 184 17

you! 0 184 28

It 0 184 29
should 0 184 29

Robert 0 184 30

Those 0 184 31
who 0 184 31

were 0 184 31
all 0 184 31

No 0 184 32

Finicum 0 184 32
would 0 184 32

that's 0 184 32
not 0 184 32
how 0 184 32

Instead, 0 186 21
President 0 186 21
Trump’s 0 186 21
POLICIES 1 186 21
have 0 186 21
actually 0 186 21

more 0 186 21

for 0 186 21
Putin 0 186 21
at 0 186 21
every 0 186 21

Here’s 0 186 22
The 0 186 22
Federalist’s 0 186 22
Mollie 0 186 22
Hemingway 0 186 22
explaining: 0 186 22

Our 0 186 23
relationship 0 186 23
with 0 186 23
Russia 0 186 23
is 0 186 23
at 0 186 23
a 0 186 23
significant 0 186 23
low 0 186 23
point 0 186 23
where 0 186 23
just 0 186 23
having 0 186 23
some 0 186 23
conversations 0 186 23
can 0 186 23
lead 0 186 23
us 0 186 23
to 0 186 23
a 0 186 23
better 0 186 23
outcome. 0 186 23

And 0 186 24
there 0 186 24
are 0 186 24
so 0 186 24
many 0 186 24
important 0 186 24
things 0 186 24
that 0 186 24
they 0 186 24
are 0 186 24
involved 0 186 24
with 0 186 24
that 0 186 24
we 0 186 24
care 0 186 24
about, 0 186 24
whether 0 186 24
it’s 0 186 24
Syria, 0 186 24
Ukraine, 0 186 24
North 0 186 24
Korea 0 186 24
or 0 186 24
nuclear 0 186 24
arms. 0 186 24

I’m 0 186 25
kind 0 186 25
of 0 186 25
surprised 0 186 25
there’s 0 186 25
been 0 186 25
this 0 186 25
much 0 186 25
angst 0 186 25
over 0 186 25
this 0 186 25
press 0 186 25
conference. 0 186 25

Not 0 186 26
that 0 186 26
he 0 186 26
said 0 186 26
things 0 186 26
the 0 186 26
way 0 186 26
he 0 186 26
should 0 186 26
have. 0 186 26

President 0 186 27
Trump 0 186 27
really 0 186 27
did 0 186 27
mess 0 186 27
up 0 186 27
with 0 186 27
that 0 186 27
press 0 186 27
conference 0 186 27
but 0 186 27
I 0 186 27
don’t 0 186 27
quite 0 186 27
know 0 186 27
what 0 186 27
people 0 186 27
want. 0 186 27

He 0 186 28
actually 0 186 28
is 0 186 28
pretty 0 186 28
tough 1 186 28
on 0 186 28
Russia. 0 186 28

And 0 186 29
in 0 186 29
the 0 186 29
last 0 186 29
couple 0 186 29
of 0 186 29
years, 0 186 29
we’ve 0 186 29
seen 0 186 29
an 0 186 29
increase 0 186 29
in 0 186 29
the 0 186 29
military 0 186 29
budget, 0 186 29
we’ve 0 186 29
seen 0 186 29
an 0 186 29
increase 0 186 29
in 0 186 29
the 0 186 29
intelligence 0 186 29
budget. 0 186 29

We 0 186 30
are 0 186 30
doing 0 186 30
NATO 0 186 30
exercises 0 186 30
in 0 186 30
the 0 186 30
Baltics. 0 186 30

We 0 186 31
provided 0 186 31
legal 0 186 31
aid 0 186 31
to 0 186 31
Ukraine 0 186 31
and 0 186 31
Georgia. 0 186 31

We’re 0 186 32
developing 0 186 32
low-yield 0 186 32
nuclear 0 186 32
weapons. 0 186 32

He 0 186 33
implemented 0 186 33
sanctions 0 186 33
that 0 186 33
were 0 186 33
even 0 186 33
stronger 0 186 33
than 0 186 33
required 0 186 33
by 0 186 33
Congressional 0 186 33
mandate. 0 186 33

So 0 186 34
if 0 186 34
you 0 186 34
care 0 186 34
about 0 186 34
actual 0 186 34
actions, 0 186 34
I 0 186 34
think 0 186 34
there’s 0 186 34
a 0 186 34
lot 0 186 34
to 0 186 34
be 0 186 34
happy 0 186 34
about 0 186 34
in 0 186 34
terms 0 186 34
of 0 186 34
a 0 186 34
tough 1 186 34
posture 0 186 34
towards 0 186 34
Russia. 0 186 34

People 0 186 35
are 0 186 35
obsessed 0 186 35
about 0 186 35
words 0 186 35
and 0 186 35
they 0 186 35
should 0 186 35
maybe 0 186 35
focus 0 186 35
on 0 186 35
the 0 186 35
actions 0 186 35
as 0 186 35
well. 0 186 35

Former 0 186 36
Speaker 0 186 36
of 0 186 36
the 0 186 36
House, 0 186 36
Newt 0 186 36
Gingrich, 0 186 36
concurred 0 186 36
with 0 186 36
Hemingway 0 186 36
arguing 0 186 36
that 0 186 36
by 0 186 36
any 0 186 36
standard 0 186 36
Trump 0 186 36
has 0 186 36
been 0 186 36
far 0 186 36
tougher 0 186 36
on 0 186 36
Russia 0 186 36
than 0 186 36
Obama 0 186 36
was. 0 186 36

First, 0 186 37
the 0 186 37
very 0 186 37
people 0 186 37
who 0 186 37
have 0 186 37
been 0 186 37
loudest 0 186 37
in 0 186 37
attacking 0 186 37
President 0 186 37
Trump 0 186 37
about 0 186 37
his 0 186 37
performance 0 186 37
at 0 186 37
the 0 186 37
Helsinki 0 186 37
summit 0 186 37
are 0 186 37
the 0 186 37
people 0 186 37
who 0 186 37
failed 0 186 37
to 0 186 37
protect 1 186 37
America 1 186 37
from 0 186 37
Russian 0 186 37
meddling 0 186 37
in 0 186 37
2016. 0 186 37

The 0 186 38
very 1 186 38
intensity 0 186 38
and 0 186 38
nastiness 1 186 38
of 0 186 38
former 0 186 38
CIA 0 186 38
Director 0 186 38
Brennan 0 186 38
and 0 186 38
former 0 186 38
Director 0 186 38
of 0 186 38
National 0 186 38
Intelligence 0 186 38
Clapper 0 186 38
is 0 186 38
an 0 186 38
attempt 0 186 38
to 0 186 38
distract 0 186 38
attention 0 186 38
from 0 186 38
their 0 186 38
failure 0 186 38
to 0 186 38
protect 1 186 38
America. 1 186 38

It 0 186 39
was 0 186 39
their 0 186 39
duty 0 186 39
in 0 186 39
2016 0 186 39
– 0 186 39
not 0 186 39
candidate 0 186 39
Trump’s. 0 186 39

Second, 0 186 40
the 0 186 40
Trump 0 186 40
administration 0 186 40
has 0 186 40
been 0 186 40
far 0 186 40
tougher 1 186 40
on 0 186 40
Russia 0 186 40
than 0 186 40
President 0 186 40
Obama 0 186 40
ever 0 186 40
dreamed 0 186 40
of 0 186 40
being. 0 186 40

The 1 186 41
Trump 1 186 41
administration 1 186 41
is 0 186 41
taking 0 186 41
real 0 186 41
actions 0 186 41
designed 0 186 41
to 0 186 41
weaken 0 186 41
Russia 0 186 41
and 0 186 41
force 0 186 41
Putin 0 186 41
to 0 186 41
change 0 186 41
his 0 186 41
aggressive 1 186 41
behavior. 0 186 41

The 1 186 42
Trump 1 186 42
administration 1 186 42
has 0 186 42
levied 0 186 42
tough 1 186 42
sanctions 0 186 42
on 0 186 42
Russia. 0 186 42

Also, 0 186 43
President 0 186 43
Trump’s 0 186 43
public 0 186 43
lecture 0 186 43
about 0 186 43
Germany 0 186 43
not 0 186 43
buying 0 186 43
natural 0 186 43
gas 0 186 43
from 0 186 43
Russia 0 186 43
was 0 186 43
aimed 0 186 43
at 0 186 43
cutting 0 186 43
Putin 0 186 43
off 0 186 43
from 0 186 43
hard 0 186 43
currency 0 186 43
worth 0 186 43
tens 0 186 43
of 0 186 43
billions 0 186 43
of 0 186 43
dollars 0 186 43
and 0 186 43
further 0 186 43
weakening 0 186 43
the 0 186 43
Russian 0 186 43
economy. 0 186 43

Furthermore, 0 186 44
President 0 186 44
Trump’s 0 186 44
efforts 0 186 44
to 0 186 44
get 0 186 44
our 1 186 44
European 0 186 44
allies 0 186 44
to 0 186 44
increase 0 186 44
their 0 186 44
defense 0 186 44
spending 0 186 44
has 0 186 44
a 0 186 44
direct 0 186 44
impact 0 186 44
on 0 186 44
Putin. 0 186 44

The 0 186 45
stronger 0 186 45
NATO 0 186 45
is, 0 186 45
the 0 186 45
less 0 186 45
maneuvering 0 186 45
room 0 186 45
Russia 0 186 45
has. 0 186 45

Beyond 0 186 46
pressuring 0 186 46
our 1 186 46
allies, 1 186 46
consider 0 186 46
these 0 186 46
specific 0 186 46
steps 0 186 46
President 0 186 46
Trump 0 186 46
has 0 186 46
taken 0 186 46
against 0 186 46
Russia: 0 186 46
Where 0 186 46
President 0 186 46
Obama 0 186 46
refused 0 186 46
to 0 186 46
provide 0 186 46
serious 0 186 46
weapons 0 186 46
to 0 186 46
the 0 186 46
Ukrainians 0 186 46
to 0 186 46
help 0 186 46
them 0 186 46
defend 0 186 46
themselves 0 186 46
(his 0 186 46
response 0 186 46
was 0 186 46
weakness 1 186 46
on 1 186 46
a 1 186 46
pathetic 1 186 46
scale), 1 186 46
President 0 186 46
Trump 0 186 46
has 0 186 46
approved 0 186 46
the 0 186 46
sale 0 186 46
of 0 186 46
offensive 0 186 46
weapons 0 186 46
to 0 186 46
enable 0 186 46

This 0 187 7
is 0 187 7
yet 0 187 7
another 0 187 7
big 0 187 7
shake-up 0 187 7
for 0 187 7
Trump’s 0 187 7
still-young 0 187 7
administration 0 187 7
— 0 187 7
and 1 187 7
it 1 187 7
may 1 187 7
be 1 187 7
the 1 187 7
most 1 187 7
important 1 187 7
one 1 187 7
to 1 187 7
date. 1 187 7

The 1 187 8
move 1 187 8
creates 1 187 8
some 1 187 8
big 1 187 8
questions 1 187 8
about 1 187 8
both 1 187 8
the 1 187 8

relationship 1 187 8
with 1 187 8
the 1 187 8
deep 1 187 8
state. 1 187 8

If 1 187 9
you 1 187 9
enjoyed 1 187 9
Hillary 1 187 9
Clinton’s 1 187 9
tenure 1 187 9
as 1 187 9
Secretary 1 187 9
of 1 187 9
State, 1 187 9
you’ll 1 187 9
like 1 187 9
Pompeo’s. 1 187 9

Like 0 187 10
Clinton 0 187 10
and 0 187 10
her 0 187 10
Democrat 0 187 10
allies, 0 187 10
Pompeo 0 187 10
has 0 187 10
long 0 187 10
subscribed 0 187 10
to 0 187 10
the 0 187 10
belief 0 187 10
that 0 187 10
Russia 0 187 10
is 1 187 10
perpetually 1 187 10
meddling 1 187 10
in 0 187 10
U.S. 0 187 10
affairs. 0 187 10

In 0 187 11
fact, 0 187 11
he 1 187 11
believes 1 187 11
Barack 1 187 11
Obama 1 187 11
got 1 187 11
Russian 1 187 11
help 1 187 11
too. 1 187 11

While 0 187 12
he 0 187 12
was 0 187 12
being 0 187 12
confirmed 0 187 12
as 0 187 12
CIA 0 187 12
chief, 0 187 12
the 0 187 12
former 0 187 12
lawmaker 0 187 12
lashed 1 187 12
out 1 187 12
at 1 187 12
Russia 1 187 12
for 0 187 12
reasserting 1 187 12
” 1 187 12
itself 1 187 12
aggressively, 1 187 12
invading 1 187 12
and 1 187 12
occupying 1 187 12
Ukraine, 1 187 12
threatening 1 187 12
Europe, 1 187 12
and 1 187 12
doing 1 187 12
nearly 1 187 12
nothing 1 187 12
to 1 187 12
aid 1 187 12
in 1 187 12
the 1 187 12
destruction 1 187 12
and 1 187 12
defeat 1 187 12
of 1 187 12
ISIS.” 1 187 12

Again, 0 187 13
if 0 187 13
you 0 187 13
liked 0 187 13
Obama-era, 0 187 13
world-on-fire, 0 187 13
Russians 0 187 13
everywhere 0 187 13
State 1 187 13
Department 1 187 13
shenanigans, 1 187 13
this 1 187 13
is 1 187 13
your 1 187 13
guy. 1 187 13

Pompeo 1 187 14
also 1 187 14
isn’t 1 187 14
a 1 187 14
huge 1 187 14
fan 1 187 14
of 1 187 14
calling 1 187 14
the 1 187 14
federal 1 187 14
government 1 187 14
out 1 187 14
when 1 187 14
it 1 187 14
is 1 187 14
clearly 1 187 14
violating 1 187 14
the 1 187 14
rights 1 187 14
of 1 187 14
Americans, 1 187 14
as 0 187 14
shown 0 187 14
by 0 187 14
his 0 187 14
statements 0 187 14
last 0 187 14
year 0 187 14
regarding 0 187 14
WikiLeaks. 0 187 14

“It 0 187 15
is 0 187 15
time 0 187 15
to 0 187 15

WikiLeaks 0 187 15
for 0 187 15
what 0 187 15
it 0 187 15
really 0 187 15
is 0 187 15
– 0 187 15
a 1 187 15

by 0 187 15
state 0 187 15
actors 0 187 15
like 0 187 15
Russia. 0 187 15

In 0 187 16
January 0 187 16
of 0 187 16
this 0 187 16
year, 0 187 16
our 0 187 16
Intelligence 0 187 16
Community 0 187 16
determined 0 187 16
that 0 187 16
Russian 0 187 16

intelligence 0 187 16
— 0 187 16
the 0 187 16
GRU 0 187 16

had 0 187 16
used 0 187 16
WikiLeaks 0 187 16
to 0 187 16
release 0 187 16
data 0 187 16
of 0 187 16
U.S. 0 187 16
victims 0 187 16
that 0 187 16
the 0 187 16
GRU 0 187 16

against 0 187 16
the 0 187 16
Democratic 0 187 16

Committee. 0 187 16

And 0 187 17
the 0 187 17
report 0 187 17
also 0 187 17
found 0 187 17
that 0 187 17

She’s 1 187 21
a 1 187 21
big 1 187 21
fan 1 187 21
of 1 187 21
torture, 1 187 21
according 0 187 21
to 0 187 21
a 0 187 21
2013 0 187 21

IN 0 187 22
MAY 0 187 22
2013, 0 187 22
the 0 187 22
Washington 0 187 22
Post’s 0 187 22
Greg 0 187 22
Miller 0 187 22
reported 0 187 22
that 0 187 22
the 0 187 22
head 0 187 22
of 0 187 22
the 0 187 22
CIA’s 0 187 22
clandestine 0 187 22
service 0 187 22
was 0 187 22
being 0 187 22
shifted 0 187 22
out 0 187 22
of 0 187 22
that 0 187 22
position 0 187 22
as 0 187 22
a 0 187 22
result 0 187 22
of 0 187 22
“a 0 187 22
management 0 187 22
shake-up” 0 187 22
by 0 187 22
then-Director 0 187 22
John 0 187 22
Brennan. 0 187 22

As 0 187 23
Miller 0 187 23
documented, 0 187 23
this 0 187 23
official 0 187 23
— 0 187 23
whom 0 187 23
the 0 187 23
paper 0 187 23
did 0 187 23
not 0 187 23
name 0 187 23
because 0 187 23
she 0 187 23
was 0 187 23
a 0 187 23
covert 0 187 23
agent 0 187 23
at 0 187 23
the 0 187 23
time 0 187 23
— 0 187 23
was 0 187 23
centrally 0 187 23
involved 0 187 23
in 0 187 23
the 1 187 23
worst 1 187 23
abuses 1 187 23
of 1 187 23
the 1 187 23
CIA’s 1 187 23
Bush-era 1 187 23
torture 1 187 23
regime. 1 187 23

As 0 187 24
Miller 0 187 24
put 0 187 24
it, 0 187 24
she 0 187 24
was 0 187 24
“directly 0 187 24
involved 0 187 24

and 0 187 24

an 0 187 24
“extensive 0 187 24

in 0 187 24
torturing 0 187 24
detainees. 0 187 24

Even 0 187 25
more 0 187 25
troubling, 0 187 25
she 0 187 25
“had 0 187 25

2 0 189 1
very 0 189 1

nothing 0 189 3
like 0 189 3
the 0 189 3

And 0 189 4
only 1 189 4
shameless 1 189 4
Zionists 1 189 4
would 1 189 4
attempt 1 189 4
to 1 189 4
equate 1 189 4

Anything 1 189 6
a 1 189 6

is 1 189 6
exactly 1 189 6

to 1 189 7

Germany 1 189 7
in 0 189 7
an 0 189 7
ominous 0 189 7
Tweet. 0 189 7

“Other 0 189 8
governments 0 189 8
have 0 189 8
separated 0 189 8
mothers 0 189 8
and 0 189 8

Former 0 189 8
CIA 0 189 8
and 0 189 8
NSA 0 189 8
chief 0 189 8
Michael 0 189 8
Hayden 0 189 8
wrote 0 189 8
on 0 189 8
Saturday, 0 189 8
along 0 189 8
with 0 189 8
a 0 189 8
black 0 189 8
and 0 189 8
white 0 189 8
photo 0 189 8

concentration 0 189 8
and 0 189 8
death-camp 1 189 8
in 0 189 8
Poland. 0 189 8

Then 0 189 9
Hayden 0 189 9
doubled 0 189 9
down 0 189 9
on 0 189 9
that 0 189 9
analogy. 0 189 9

It's 0 189 10
particularly 1 189 10
stupid 1 189 10
of 0 189 10
Michael 0 189 10
Hayden 0 189 10
to 0 189 10
make 0 189 10
that 0 189 10
analogy 0 189 10
because 0 189 10
during 0 189 10
the 0 189 10
Bush 0 189 10
years, 0 189 10
the 0 189 10
agencies 0 189 10
he 0 189 10
ran 0 189 10
were 0 189 10
compared 0 189 10
to 0 189 10
Nazi 1 189 10
Germany. 0 189 10

Repeatedly. 0 189 11

You 0 189 12
might 0 189 12
think 0 189 12
that 0 189 12
would 0 189 12
have 0 189 12
cured 0 189 12
him 0 189 12
of 0 189 12
facile 0 189 12
Nazi 1 189 12
analogies. 0 189 12

But 0 189 13
instead 0 189 13
it 0 189 13
seems 0 189 13
to 0 189 13
have 0 189 13
whetted 0 189 13
his 0 189 13
appetite 0 189 13
for 0 189 13
making 0 189 13
them. 0 189 13

Yes, 0 189 14
the 0 189 14
Nazi 1 189 14
arrested 0 189 14
people, 0 189 14
asked 0 189 14
them 0 189 14
for 0 189 14
ID, 0 189 14
split 0 189 14
up 0 189 14
families 0 189 14
and... 0 189 14
then 0 189 14
killed 1 189 14
them 1 189 14
all. 1 189 14

That's 0 189 15
the 0 189 15
really 0 189 15
relevant 0 189 15
part. 0 189 15

Every 0 189 16
country 0 189 16
arrests 0 189 16
people. 0 189 16

Just 0 189 17
about 0 189 17
every 0 189 17
country 0 189 17
splits 0 189 17
up 0 189 17
families 0 189 17
when 0 189 17
they 0 189 17
arrest 0 189 17
the 0 189 17
parents. 0 189 17

That's 0 189 18
not 0 189 18
unique. 0 189 18

Selecting 0 189 19
the 0 189 19
Jews, 0 189 19
based 0 189 19
on 0 189 19
race, 0 189 19
for 0 189 19
extermination 1 189 19
is 0 189 19
more 0 189 19
of 0 189 19
the 0 189 19
reason 0 189 19
why 0 189 19
the 0 189 19
term 0 189 19
Nazi 1 189 19
is 0 189 19
not 0 189 19
a 0 189 19
positive 0 189 19
one. 0 189 19

Hayden's 0 189 20
thoughtless 1 189 20
tweet 0 189 20
can 0 189 20
just 0 189 20
as 0 189 20
easily 0 189 20

22-year-old 0 193 23

“It 0 193 25
was 0 193 25

a 0 193 25

Saucier’s 0 193 25
lawyer, 0 193 25
Greg 0 193 25
Rinckey, 0 193 25
said. 0 193 25

“It’s 0 193 26
a 0 193 26
very 0 193 26
sad 0 193 26
case 0 193 26
because 0 193 26
Kristian 0 193 26
Saucier 0 193 26
is 0 193 26
a 1 193 26
fine 1 193 26
young 1 193 26
man. 1 193 26

We 0 193 27
don’t 0 193 27
believe 0 193 27
this 0 193 27
was 0 193 27
really 0 193 27
his 0 193 27
true 0 193 27
character.” 0 193 27

“My 0 193 28
case 0 193 28
was 0 193 28
usually 0 193 28
something 0 193 28
handled 0 193 28
by 0 193 28
military 0 193 28
courts,” 0 193 28
Saucier 0 193 28
said. 0 193 28

“They 1 193 29
used 1 193 29
me 1 193 29
as 1 193 29
an 1 193 29
example 1 193 29
because 1 193 29
of 1 193 29
[the 1 193 29
backlash 1 193 29
over] 1 193 29
Hillary 1 193 29
Clinton,” 1 193 29
he 0 193 29
continued, 0 193 29
alleging 0 193 29
his 0 193 29
life 0 193 29
was 0 193 29
ruined 0 193 29
for 0 193 29
political 0 193 29
reasons. 0 193 29

President 0 193 30
Trump 0 193 30
had 0 193 30
spoken 0 193 30
of 0 193 30
his 0 193 30
support 0 193 30
of 0 193 30
Saucier 0 193 30
on 0 193 30
the 0 193 30
campaign 0 193 30
trail 0 193 30
and 0 193 30
blasted 0 193 30
the 0 193 30
Obama 0 193 30
administration's 0 193 30
handling 0 193 30
of 0 193 30
his 0 193 30
case. 0 193 30

“With 0 193 31
a 0 193 31
pardon, 0 193 31
there’s 0 193 31
no 0 193 31
magic 0 193 31
wand 0 193 31
that 0 193 31
gets 0 193 31
waved 0 193 31
and 0 193 31
makes 0 193 31
everything 0 193 31
right,” 0 193 31
Saucier 0 193 31
said, 0 193 31
“But 0 193 31
I 0 193 31
try 0 193 31
to 0 193 31
stay 0 193 31
positive 0 193 31
and 0 193 31
look 0 193 31
forward.” 0 193 31

That's 0 193 32
a 0 193 32
good 0 193 32
attitude 0 193 32
considering 0 193 32
he 0 193 32
has 0 193 32
had 0 193 32
his 0 193 32
cars 0 193 32
repossessed 0 193 32
and 0 193 32
is 0 193 32
in 0 193 32
a 0 193 32
tremendous 1 193 32
amount 0 193 32
of 0 193 32
debt 0 193 32
due 0 193 32
to 0 193 32
his 0 193 32
incarceration 0 193 32
and 0 193 32
now 0 193 32
having 0 193 32
a 0 193 32
felony 0 193 32
on 0 193 32
his 0 193 32
record. 0 193 32

hey, 0 193 33
Hillary 0 193 33
is 0 193 33
free, 0 193 33
right? 0 193 33

That's 0 193 34
all 0 193 34
that 0 193 34
matters, 0 193 34

after 0 193 34

act 0 198 5
have 0 198 5
been 0 198 5
so 1 198 5
outlandish 1 198 5
– 0 198 5
even 0 198 5
for 0 198 5
people 0 198 5
who 0 198 5
are 0 198 5
mostly 0 198 5
OK 0 198 5
with 0 198 5
Francis 0 198 5
– 0 198 5
that 0 198 5
very 0 198 5
few 0 198 5
people 0 198 5
are 0 198 5
still 0 198 5
willing 0 198 5
to 0 198 5
make 0 198 5
polite 0 198 5
noises 0 198 5
about 0 198 5
it. 0 198 5

prefect 0 198 7
of 0 198 7
the 0 198 7
Secretariat 0 198 7
for 0 198 7
Communications, 0 198 7
the 0 198 7
former 0 198 7
pope 0 198 7
reportedly 0 198 7
offers 0 198 7
an 0 198 7
impassioned 1 198 7
defense 1 198 7
of 0 198 7
Pope 0 198 7
Francis 0 198 7
against 0 198 7
the 0 198 7
claim 0 198 7
that 0 198 7
he 0 198 7
lacks 0 198 7
theological 0 198 7
and 0 198 7
philosophical 0 198 7
formation. 0 198 7

In 0 198 8
no 0 198 8
uncertain 0 198 8
terms, 0 198 8
this 0 198 8
letter, 0 198 8
bearing 0 198 8
Benedict's 0 198 8
signature, 0 198 8
affirms 0 198 8
that 0 198 8
“there 0 198 8
is 0 198 8
an 0 198 8
internal 0 198 8
continuity 0 198 8
between 0 198 8
the 0 198 8
two 0 198 8
pontificates.” 0 198 8
Whether 0 198 8
Benedict 0 198 8
actually 0 198 8
wrote 0 198 8
this 0 198 8
letter 0 198 8
or 0 198 8
not, 0 198 8
it 0 198 8
gives 0 198 8

to 0 198 8
a 0 198 8
number 0 198 8

grave 1 198 8
questions 1 198 8
that 0 198 8

MJM 0 198 10

In 0 198 11
fact, 0 198 11
five 0 198 11
years 0 198 11
after 0 198 11
the 0 198 11
resignation 0 198 11
of 0 198 11
Pope 0 198 11
Benedict 0 198 11
the 0 198 11
Catholic 0 198 11
faithful 0 198 11
mostly 0 198 11
want 0 198 11
to 0 198 11
know 0 198 11
why; 0 198 11
why 0 198 11
would 0 198 11
a 0 198 11
pope 0 198 11
– 0 198 11
a 0 198 11
man 0 198 11
with 0 198 11
decades 0 198 11
of 0 198 11
up-close-and-personal 0 198 11
experience 0 198 11
of 0 198 11
the 0 198 11
“filth” 1 198 11
in 0 198 11
the 0 198 11
Curia 0 198 11
and 0 198 11
throughout 0 198 11
the 0 198 11
church 0 198 11
– 0 198 11
suddenly 0 198 11
just 0 198 11
decide 0 198 11
to 0 198 11
quit? 0 198 11

Why 0 198 12
would 0 198 12
he 0 198 12
choose 0 198 12
to 0 198 12
walk 0 198 12
away 0 198 12
knowing 0 198 12
that 0 198 12
his 0 198 12
task 0 198 12
was 0 198 12
not 0 198 12
completed? 0 198 12

At 0 198 13
the 0 198 13
time 0 198 13
and 0 198 13
since 0 198 13
then, 0 198 13
particularly 0 198 13
in 0 198 13
light 0 198 13
of 0 198 13
what 0 198 13
has 0 198 13
been 0 198 13
happening, 0 198 13
it 0 198 13
seems 0 198 13
one 1 198 13
of 1 198 13
the 1 198 13
most 1 198 13
bizarre 1 198 13
aspects 1 198 13
of 1 198 13
this 1 198 13
whole 1 198 13
bizarre 1 198 13
situation 1 198 13
that 0 198 13
the 0 198 13
reasons 0 198 13
offered 0 198 13
have 0 198 13
been 0 198 13
so 1 198 13
trivial, 1 198 13
so 1 198 13
inappropriately, 1 198 13
so 1 198 13
disproportionately 1 198 13
petty. 1 198 13

These 0 198 14
absurd 1 198 14
responses 1 198 14
to 1 198 14
serious 1 198 14
questions 1 198 14
of 1 198 14
grave 1 198 14
import 1 198 14
have 0 198 14
raised 0 198 14
the 0 198 14
inescapable 0 198 14
suspicion 0 198 14
that 0 198 14
Benedict 0 198 14
simply 0 198 14
did 0 198 14
not 0 198 14
take 0 198 14
the 0 198 14
papacy 0 198 14
as 0 198 14
seriously 0 198 14
as 0 198 14
the 0 198 14
rest 0 198 14
of 0 198 14
us 0 198 14
did. 0 198 14

We 0 198 15
cannot 0 198 15
help 0 198 15
but 0 198 15
wonder 0 198 15
if 0 198 15
these 0 198 15
trivialised 0 198 15
responses 0 198 15
reveal 0 198 15
some 0 198 15
deep 0 198 15
flaw 0 198 15
that 0 198 15
we 0 198 15
had 0 198 15
never 0 198 15
suspected 0 198 15
before. 0 198 15

Could 1 198 16
we 1 198 16
have 1 198 16
been 1 198 16
wrong 1 198 16
about 1 198 16
him? 1 198 16

And 1 198 17
if 1 198 17
so, 1 198 17
could 1 198 17
we 1 198 17
have 1 198 17
been 1 198 17
this 1 198 17
wrong? 1 198 17

For 0 198 18
reasons, 0 198 18
all 0 198 18
we 0 198 18
heard 0 198 18
at 0 198 18
the 0 198 18
time 0 198 18
was, 0 198 18
essentially, 0 198 18
“I’m 1 198 18
tired.” 1 198 18
There 0 198 18
was 0 198 18
some 0 198 18
implication 0 198 18
that 0 198 18
he 0 198 18
didn’t 0 198 18
feel 0 198 18
up 0 198 18
to 0 198 18
international 0 198 18
travel 0 198 18
anymore, 0 198 18
so 0 198 18
couldn’t 0 198 18
make 0 198 18
it 0 198 18
to 0 198 18
World 0 198 18
Youth 0 198 18
Day 0 198 18
and 0 198 18
similar 0 198 18
events. 0 198 18

The 0 198 19
trivialising 0 198 19
of 0 198 19
the 0 198 19
resignation 0 198 19
seemed 0 198 19
to 0 198 19
go 0 198 19
hand 0 198 19
in 0 198 19
hand 0 198 19
with 0 198 19
the 0 198 19
modern 0 198 19
concept 0 198 19
of 0 198 19
the 0 198 19
pope-as-pop-star, 1 198 19
something 0 198 19
we 0 198 19
had 0 198 19
thought 0 198 19
Benedict 0 198 19
was 0 198 19
too 0 198 19
serious 0 198 19
a 0 198 19
man, 0 198 19
too 0 198 19
serious 0 198 19
a 0 198 19
Catholic, 0 198 19
to 0 198 19
believe 0 198 19
himself. 0 198 19

Of 0 198 20
all 0 198 20
people, 0 198 20
we 0 198 20
had 0 198 20
assumed 0 198 20
that 0 198 20
Benedict 0 198 20
XVI 0 198 20
took 0 198 20
the 0 198 20
papacy 0 198 20
seriously. 0 198 20

And 0 198 21
since 0 198 21
then, 0 198 21
as 0 198 21
all 0 198 21
the 0 198 21
poisons 0 198 21
that 0 198 21
had 0 198 21
been 0 198 21
lurking 0 198 21
for 0 198 21
fifty 0 198 21
years 0 198 21
in 0 198 21
the 0 198 21
NewChurch 1 198 21
mud 1 198 21
are 0 198 21
busily 0 198 21
hatching 0 198 21
out, 0 198 21
many 0 198 21
Catholics 0 198 21
want 0 198 21
to 0 198 21
know 0 198 21
why 0 198 21
we 0 198 21
hear 0 198 21
nothing 0 198 21
from 0 198 21
him? 0 198 21

This 0 198 22
man 0 198 22
whom 0 198 22
we 0 198 22
had 0 198 22
believed 0 198 22
a 0 198 22
“champion 1 198 22
of 1 198 22
orthodoxy,” 1 198 22
whom 0 198 22
we 0 198 22
thought 0 198 22
we 0 198 22
knew. 0 198 22

Error, 0 198 23
even 0 198 23
heresy 1 198 23
and 1 198 23
blasphemy 1 198 23
are 0 198 23
pouring 0 198 23
daily 0 198 23
out 0 198 23
of 0 198 23
the 0 198 23
mouth 0 198 23
of 0 198 23
his 0 198 23
successor, 0 198 23
who 0 198 23
has, 0 198 23
literally, 0 198 23
turned 1 198 23
the 1 198 23
Vatican 1 198 23
into 1 198 23
a 1 198 23
den 1 198 23
of 1 198 23
thieves, 1 198 23
and 0 198 23
we 0 198 23
hear 0 198 23
nothing 0 198 23
but 0 198 23
the 0 198 23
occasional, 0 198 23
carefully 0 198 23
worded 0 198 23
statement 0 198 23
on 0 198 23
how 0 198 23
fine 0 198 23
everything 0 198 23
is. 0 198 23

How 0 198 24
content 0 198 24
he 0 198 24
is 0 198 24
with 0 198 24
his 0 198 24
decision 0 198 24
and 0 198 24
how 0 198 24
happy 0 198 24
with 0 198 24
his 0 198 24
current 0 198 24
life. 0 198 24

After 0 198 25
three 0 198 25
years 0 198 25
of 0 198 25
systematic 0 198 25
dismantling 0 198 25
of 0 198 25
everything 0 198 25
he 0 198 25
had 0 198 25
attempted 0 198 25
to 0 198 25
do 0 198 25
in 0 198 25
his 0 198 25
pontificate, 0 198 25
we 0 198 25
got 0 198 25
this 0 198 25
from 0 198 25
an 0 198 25
apparently 0 198 25
utterly 1 198 25
insouciant 1 198 25
Ratzinger, 0 198 25
addressed 0 198 25
to 0 198 25
Francis: 0 198 25
“Your 0 198 25
goodness 0 198 25
is 0 198 25
my 0 198 25
home 0 198 25
and 0 198 25
the 0 198 25
place 0 198 25
where 0 198 25
I 0 198 25
feel 0 198 25
safe.” 0 198 25
Everyone 0 198 25
who 0 198 25
had 0 198 25
ever 0 198 25
read 0 198 25
anything 0 198 25
he 0 198 25
had 0 198 25
written 0 198 25
were 0 198 25
amazed 0 198 25
he 0 198 25
was 0 198 25
capable 0 198 25
of 0 198 25
producing 0 198 25
such 0 198 25
maudlin 0 198 25
drivel, 0 198 25
but 0 198 25
the 0 198 25
video 0 198 25
doesn’t 0 198 25
lie: 0 198 25

So 0 198 26
strange 0 198 26
was 0 198 26
this 0 198 26
new 0 198 26
tone 0 198 26
that 0 198 26
speculation 0 198 26
started 0 198 26
circulating 0 198 26
that 0 198 26
he 0 198 26
was 0 198 26
under 0 198 26
some 0 198 26
kind 0 198 26
of 0 198 26
external 0 198 26
compulsion, 0 198 26
not 0 198 26
free 0 198 26
to 0 198 26
speak 0 198 26
his 0 198 26
mind. 0 198 26

But 0 198 27
this 0 198 27
is 0 198 27
not 0 198 27
what 0 198 27
we 0 198 27
see. 0 198 27

There 0 198 28
he 0 198 28
is, 0 198 28
manifestly 0 198 28
happy 0 198 28
and 0 198 28
reading 0 198 28
it 0 198 28
out 0 198 28
loud. 0 198 28

“Perhaps 0 198 29
it 0 198 29
was 0 198 29
written 0 198 29
for 0 198 29
him.” 0 198 29
Well, 0 198 29
why 0 198 29
repeat 0 198 29
it 0 198 29
then? 0 198 29

Why, 0 198 30
if 0 198 30
he 0 198 30
has 0 198 30
any 0 198 30
qualms, 0 198 30
allow 0 198 30
himself 0 198 30
to 0 198 30
be 0 198 30
trotted 0 198 30
out 0 198 30
on 0 198 30
such 0 198 30
occasions, 0 198 30
to 0 198 30
read 0 198 30
this 0 198 30
blatant 0 198 30
propaganda? 0 198 30

If 0 198 31
it 0 198 31
is 0 198 31
a 0 198 31
deception, 0 198 31
why 0 198 31
participate 0 198 31
in 0 198 31
it? 0 198 31

In 0 198 32
fact, 0 198 32
all 0 198 32
the 0 198 32
hopeful 0 198 32
commenters 0 198 32
on 0 198 32
blogs 0 198 32
and 0 198 32
other 0 198 32
social 0 198 32
media 0 198 32
who 0 198 32
keep 0 198 32
telling 0 198 32
me 0 198 32
how 0 198 32
much 0 198 32
they 0 198 32
“miss” 0 198 32
him 0 198 32
have 0 198 32
failed 0 198 32
to 0 198 32
respect 0 198 32
him 0 198 32
in 0 198 32
one 0 198 32
way; 0 198 32
they 0 198 32
won’t 0 198 32
take 0 198 32
him 0 198 32
at 0 198 32
his 0 198 32
word. 0 198 32

Some 0 198 33
insist 0 198 33
that 0 198 33
his 0 198 33
resignation 0 198 33
was 0 198 33
under 0 198 33
some 0 198 33
sort 0 198 33
of 0 198 33
coercion 0 198 33
and 0 198 33
so 0 198 33
isn’t 0 198 33
valid. 0 198 33

But 0 198 34
we 0 198 34
have 0 198 34
repeatedly 0 198 34
heard 0 198 34
from 0 198 34
him 0 198 34
that 0 198 34
he 0 198 34
was 0 198 34
under 0 198 34
no 0 198 34
constraint, 0 198 34
that 0 198 34
he 0 198 34
had 0 198 34
resigned 0 198 34
freely. 0 198 34

And 0 198 35
indeed, 0 198 35
far 0 198 35
from 0 198 35
being 0 198 35
an 0 198 35
isolated 0 198 35
“prisoner 1 198 35
of 1 198 35
the 1 198 35
Vatican,” 1 198 35
Benedict 0 198 35
has 0 198 35
received 0 198 35
many 0 198 35
guests 0 198 35
all 0 198 35
of 0 198 35
whom 0 198 35
report 0 198 35
that, 0 198 35
though 0 198 35
frail, 0 198 35
he 0 198 35
appears 0 198 35
content 0 198 35
and 0 198 35
never 0 198 35
utters 0 198 35
a 0 198 35
word 0 198 35
of 0 198 35
criticism. 0 198 35

We 0 198 36
have 0 198 36
yet 0 198 36
to 0 198 36
hear 0 198 36
any 0 198 36
report 0 198 36
of 0 198 36
any 0 198 36
notes 0 198 36
begging 0 198 36
for 0 198 36
rescue 0 198 36
hidden 0 198 36
under 0 198 36
a 0 198 36
lunch 0 198 36
table 0 198 36
placemat. 0 198 36

There’s 0 198 37
no 0 198 37
doubt 0 198 37
that 0 198 37
this 0 198 37
is 0 198 37
an 0 198 37
extremely 0 198 37
strange 0 198 37
and 0 198 37
frankly 0 198 37
fishy 0 198 37
situation; 0 198 37
something 0 198 37
doesn’t 0 198 37
add 0 198 37
up, 0 198 37
it’s 0 198 37
true. 0 198 37

All 0 198 38
the 0 198 38
questions 0 198 38
have 0 198 38
gone 0 198 38
ignored, 0 198 38
or 0 198 38
have 0 198 38
received 0 198 38
frivolous, 1 198 38
jokey 1 198 38
responses: 1 198 38

Why 0 198 39
did 0 198 39
you 0 198 39
resign? 0 198 39

Ratzinger: 0 198 40
“I 0 198 40
was 0 198 40
a 0 198 40
bit 0 198 40
tired 0 198 40
and 0 198 40
didn’t 0 198 40
feel 0 198 40
up 0 198 40
to 0 198 40
partying 0 198 40
with 0 198 40
the 0 198 40
kids 0 198 40
at 0 198 40
World 0 198 40
Youth 0 198 40
Day.” 0 198 40

If 0 198 41
you’re 0 198 41
not 0 198 41
pope, 0 198 41
why 0 198 41
do 0 198 41
you 0 198 41
still 0 198 41
wear 0 198 41
the 0 198 41
white? 0 198 41

Ratzinger: 0 198 42
“Oh, 0 198 42
there 0 198 42
wasn’t 0 198 42
a 0 198 42
black 0 198 42
cassock 0 198 42
that 0 198 42
fit 0 198 42
me.” 0 198 42

Why 0 198 43
do 0 198 43
you 0 198 43
continue 0 198 43
to 0 198 43
call 0 198 43
yourself 0 198 43
Benedict 0 198 43
XVI 0 198 43
if 0 198 43
you 0 198 43
are 0 198 43
no 0 198 43
longer 0 198 43
pope? 0 198 43

Ratzinger: 0 198 44
“Well, 0 198 44
I’m 0 198 44
an 0 198 44
‘emeritus,’ 0 198 44
you 0 198 44
see…” 0 198 44

And 0 198 45
where 0 198 45
did 0 198 45
this 0 198 45
“emeritus” 0 198 45
business 0 198 45
come 0 198 45
from? 0 198 45

Does 0 198 46
it 0 198 46
have 0 198 46
any 0 198 46
precedent 0 198 46
in 0 198 46
Catholic 0 198 46
history? 0 198 46

What 0 198 47
does 0 198 47
it 0 198 47
mean 0 198 47
canonically 0 198 47
and 0 198 47
doctrinally? 0 198 47

Ratzinger: 0 198 48
“…” 0 198 48

What 0 198 49
was 0 198 49
all 1 198 49
that 1 198 49
rubbish 1 198 49
from 0 198 49
Ganswein 0 198 49
about 0 198 49
there 0 198 49
being 0 198 49
a 0 198 49
divided 0 198 49
“munus” 0 198 49
– 0 198 49
with 0 198 49
an 0 198 49
active 0 198 49
member 0 198 49
and 0 198 49
a 0 198 49
“contemplative 0 198 49
member”? 0 198 49

Doesn’t 0 198 50
that 0 198 50
just 0 198 50
mean 0 198 50
there 0 198 50
are 0 198 50
two 0 198 50
popes 0 198 50
now? 0 198 50

Ratzinger: 0 198 51
“…” 0 198 51

And 0 198 52
perhaps 0 198 52
most 0 198 52
agonising 0 198 52
of 0 198 52
all: 0 198 52
“How 1 198 52
can 1 198 52
you 1 198 52
just 1 198 52
sit 1 198 52
there 1 198 52
smiling, 1 198 52
issuing 1 198 52
bland 1 198 52
platitudinous 1 198 52
nonsense, 1 198 52
while 1 198 52
this 1 198 52
lunatic 1 198 52
drives 1 198 52
the 1 198 52
sheep 1 198 52
off 1 198 52
a 1 198 52
cliff?” 1 198 52

A 0 198 53
few 0 198 53
days 0 198 53
ago, 0 198 53
my 0 198 53
friend 0 198 53
Steve 0 198 53
Skojec, 0 198 53
of 0 198 53
the 0 198 53
traditionalist/restorationist 0 198 53
website 0 198 53
One 0 198 53
Peter 0 198 53
Five, 0 198 53
summed 0 198 53
up 0 198 53
the 0 198 53
consternation 0 198 53
of 0 198 53
those 0 198 53
of 0 198 53
us 0 198 53
who 0 198 53
still 0 198 53
feel 0 198 53
a 0 198 53
lingering 0 198 53
affection 0 198 53
for 0 198 53
(the 0 198 53
man 0 198 53
we 0 198 53
used 0 198 53
to 0 198 53
call) 0 198 53
Pope 0 198 53
Benedict. 0 198 53

Steve 0 198 54
summons 0 198 54
up 0 198 54
in 0 198 54
this 0 198 54
brief 0 198 54
post 0 198 54
all 0 198 54
the 0 198 54
anger 0 198 54
and 0 198 54
all 0 198 54
the 0 198 54
crushing 1 198 54
disappointment 1 198 54
most 0 198 54
of 0 198 54
us 0 198 54
probably 0 198 54
still 0 198 54
feel 0 198 54
reluctant 0 198 54
to 0 198 54
express 0 198 54
out 0 198 54
loud: 0 198 54

Five 0 198 55
years 0 198 55
ago 0 198 55
today, 0 198 55
Pope 0 198 55
Benedict 0 198 55
XVI 0 198 55
abdicated 0 198 55
the 0 198 55
papacy. 0 198 55

And 0 198 56
through 0 198 56
the 0 198 56
abandonment 0 198 56
of 0 198 56
his 0 198 56
duty 0 198 56
to 0 198 56
shepherd 0 198 56
the 0 198 56
Church, 0 198 56
he 0 198 56
made 0 198 56
way 0 198 56
for 0 198 56
the 0 198 56
worst 0 198 56
papacy 0 198 56
of 0 198 56
all 0 198 56
time 0 198 56
– 0 198 56
one 0 198 56
he 0 198 56
steadfastly 0 198 56
refuses 0 198 56
to 0 198 56
oppose 0 198 56
in 0 198 56
word, 0 198 56
deed, 0 198 56
or 0 198 56
even 0 198 56
the 0 198 56
subtlest 0 198 56
gesture. 0 198 56

You 0 198 57
may 0 198 57
love 0 198 57
him 0 198 57
for 0 198 57
various 0 198 57
reasons, 0 198 57
you 0 198 57
may 0 198 57
miss 0 198 57
him 0 198 57
by 0 198 57
contrast, 0 198 57
but 0 198 57
you 0 198 57
may 0 198 57
not 0 198 57
excuse 0 198 57
the 0 198 57
responsibility 0 198 57
he 0 198 57
has. 0 198 57

He 0 198 58
walked 0 198 58
away 0 198 58
from 0 198 58
his 0 198 58
family, 0 198 58
leaving 0 198 58
the 0 198 58
door 0 198 58
open 0 198 58
to 0 198 58
an 0 198 58
abusive 1 198 58
stepfather, 1 198 58
and 0 198 58
he 0 198 58
watches 1 198 58
his 1 198 58
children 1 198 58
beaten 1 198 58
and 1 198 58
led 1 198 58
astray 1 198 58
not 0 198 58
just 0 198 58
in 0 198 58
silence, 0 198 58
but 0 198 58
in 0 198 58
apparent 0 198 58
contentment. 0 198 58

And 0 198 59
still, 0 198 59
he 0 198 59
was 0 198 59
the 0 198 59
best 0 198 59
of 0 198 59
the 0 198 59
post-conciliar 0 198 59
popes, 0 198 59
which 0 198 59
is 0 198 59
why 0 198 59
he’s 0 198 59
the 0 198 59
only 0 198 59
one 0 198 59
who 0 198 59
won’t 0 198 59
be 0 198 59
canonized. 0 198 59

Who 0 198 60
is 0 198 60
the 0 198 60
real 0 198 60
Joseph 0 198 60
Ratzinger? 0 198 60

I 0 198 61
have 0 198 61
had 0 198 61
long-time 0 198 61
Vatican 0 198 61
watchers 0 198 61
say 0 198 61
to 0 198 61
me, 0 198 61
more 0 198 61
than 0 198 61
once, 0 198 61
“Maybe 0 198 61
it’s 0 198 61
really 0 198 61
just 0 198 61
that 0 198 61
he 0 198 61
wasn’t 0 198 61
who 0 198 61
we 0 198 61
thought 0 198 61
he 0 198 61
was.” 0 198 61
I 0 198 61
suspect 0 198 61
there 0 198 61
is 0 198 61
a 0 198 61
lot 0 198 61
more 0 198 61
to 0 198 61
this 0 198 61
than 0 198 61
most 0 198 61
people 0 198 61
might 0 198 61
imagine. 0 198 61

I 0 198 62
think 0 198 62
we 0 198 62
made 0 198 62
the 0 198 62
mistake 0 198 62
of 0 198 62
believing 0 198 62
the 0 198 62
press. 0 198 62

We 0 198 63
were 0 198 63
delighted 0 198 63
that 0 198 63
the 0 198 63
bitterly 1 198 63
anti-Catholic 1 198 63
media 1 198 63
hated 0 198 63
and 0 198 63
feared 0 198 63
him. 0 198 63

We 0 198 64
failed 0 198 64
to 0 198 64
recall 0 198 64
that 0 198 64
they 0 198 64
know 0 198 64
nothing 0 198 64
at 0 198 64
all 0 198 64
about 0 198 64
Catholicism. 0 198 64

What 0 198 65
the 0 198 65
papers 0 198 65
never 0 198 65
told 0 198 65
us 0 198 65
was 0 198 65
that 0 198 65
as 0 198 65
a 0 198 65
young 0 198 65
priest 0 198 65
and 0 198 65
theologian 0 198 65
Joseph 0 198 65
Ratzinger 0 198 65
was 1 198 65
known 1 198 65
as 1 198 65
a 1 198 65
“progressive,” 1 198 65
as 0 198 65
the 0 198 65
term 0 198 65
was 0 198 65
understood 0 198 65
in 0 198 65
1962. 0 198 65

This 0 198 66
reputation 0 198 66
was 0 198 66
cemented 0 198 66
during 0 198 66
his 0 198 66
work 0 198 66
as 0 198 66
the 0 198 66
peritus, 0 198 66
the 0 198 66
theological 0 198 66
advisor, 0 198 66
of 0 198 66
one 0 198 66
of 0 198 66
the 0 198 66
Council’s 0 198 66
most 0 198 66
influential 0 198 66
of 0 198 66
the 0 198 66
bishops 0 198 66
of 0 198 66
the 0 198 66
progressive 0 198 66
camp, 0 198 66
Cardinal 0 198 66
Josef 0 198 66
Frings 0 198 66
of 0 198 66
Cologne. 0 198 66

Frings’ 0 198 67
claim 0 198 67
to 0 198 67
fame 0 198 67
in 0 198 67
that 0 198 67
great 0 198 67
drama 0 198 67
was 0 198 67
a 0 198 67
speech 0 198 67
criticising 0 198 67
the 0 198 67
CDF 0 198 67
– 0 198 67
and 0 198 67
its 0 198 67
prefect 0 198 67
Cardinal 0 198 67
Alfredo 0 198 67
Ottaviani 0 198 67
– 0 198 67
for 0 198 67
the 0 198 67
“conservatism” 0 198 67
in 0 198 67
the 0 198 67
“schema,” 0 198 67
the 0 198 67
documents 0 198 67
prepared 0 198 67
by 0 198 67
the 0 198 67
CDF 0 198 67
for 0 198 67
guiding 0 198 67
the 0 198 67
bishops’ 0 198 67
discussions. 0 198 67

After 0 198 68
this 0 198 68
speech, 0 198 68
there 0 198 68
was 0 198 68
an 0 198 68
uprising 0 198 68
among 0 198 68
the 0 198 68
bishops 0 198 68
of 0 198 68
the 0 198 68
preparatory 0 198 68
committee 0 198 68
who 0 198 68
demanded 0 198 68
that 0 198 68
the 0 198 68
schema 0 198 68
– 0 198 68
that 0 198 68
had 0 198 68
taken 0 198 68
years 0 198 68
to 0 198 68
develop 0 198 68
– 0 198 68
be 0 198 68
abandoned. 0 198 68

This 0 198 69
was 0 198 69
done, 0 198 69
over 0 198 69
Ottaviani’s 0 198 69
futile 1 198 69
objections, 1 198 69
and 0 198 69

rapidly 0 198 69
cobbled 0 198 69
together 0 198 69
by 0 198 69

German 0 198 69

French 0 198 69
“progressives” 1 198 69
who 0 198 69
rejoiced 0 198 69
that 0 198 69
they 0 198 69
had, 0 198 69
in 0 198 69
effect, 0 198 69
seized 0 198 69
control 0 198 69
of 0 198 69
the 0 198 69
Council 0 198 69
from 0 198 69
that 0 198 69
moment, 0 198 69
before 0 198 69
it 0 198 69
had 0 198 69

started. 0 198 69

It 0 198 70
has 0 198 70
since 0 198 70

recalling 0 198 71
that 0 198 71

said: 0 198 71

“Joseph 0 198 72

the 0 198 74

one 0 198 75
of 0 198 75
these 0 198 75

became 0 198 75

was 0 198 75

Card. 0 198 76

Ottaviani, 0 198 77

Ratzinger’s 0 198 82
reputation 0 198 82
as 0 198 82
a 0 198 82
“progressive” 1 198 82
is 0 198 82
not 0 198 82
based 0 198 82
on 0 198 82

restricted 0 198 82
to 0 198 82
his 0 198 82
early 0 198 82
work. 0 198 82

It 0 198 83
went 0 198 83
unnoticed 0 198 83
in 0 198 83
the 0 198 83
shouting 0 198 83
over 0 198 83
his 0 198 83
running 0 198 83
of 0 198 83
CDF, 0 198 83
that 0 198 83
he 0 198 83
had 0 198 83
written 0 198 83
in 0 198 83
1982, 0 198 83
a 0 198 83
call 0 198 83
for 0 198 83
the 0 198 83
Church 0 198 83
“never 0 198 83
to 0 198 83

to 0 198 83
the 0 198 83
Syllabus 0 198 83
of 0 198 83
Errors 0 198 83
of 0 198 83
Pius 0 198 83
IX. 0 198 83

In 0 198 84
his 0 198 84
book 0 198 84
Principles 0 198 84
of 0 198 84
Catholic 0 198 84
Theology, 0 198 84
Ratzinger 0 198 84
proposed 0 198 84
the 0 198 84
question, 0 198 84
“Should 0 198 84
the 0 198 84
Council 0 198 84
be 0 198 84
revoked?” 0 198 84
and 0 198 84
in 0 198 84
response 0 198 84
recommended 0 198 84
the 0 198 84
“razing 0 198 84
of 0 198 84
the 0 198 84
bastions” 0 198 84
of 0 198 84
the 0 198 84
Catholic 0 198 84
Church 0 198 84
in 0 198 84
relation 0 198 84
to 0 198 84
the 0 198 84
modern 0 198 84
world: 0 198 84

The 0 198 85
duty 0 198 85
is, 0 198 85
therefore, 0 198 85
not 0 198 85
to 0 198 85
suppress 0 198 85
the 0 198 85
Council, 0 198 85
but 0 198 85
to 0 198 85
discover 0 198 85
the 0 198 85
real 0 198 85
Council 0 198 85
and 0 198 85
delve 0 198 85
deep 0 198 85
into 0 198 85
what 0 198 85
it 0 198 85
truly 0 198 85
wants 0 198 85
with 0 198 85
regard 0 198 85
to 0 198 85
what 0 198 85
has 0 198 85
happened 0 198 85
since 0 198 85
then. 0 198 85

This 0 198 86
implies 0 198 86
that 0 198 86
there 0 198 86
is 0 198 86
no 0 198 86
possible 0 198 86
return 0 198 86
to 0 198 86
the 0 198 86
Syllabus, 0 198 86
which 0 198 86
could 0 198 86
well 0 198 86
have 0 198 86
been 0 198 86
a 0 198 86
first 0 198 86
step 0 198 86
in 0 198 86
the 0 198 86
combat 0 198 86
against 0 198 86
Liberalism 0 198 86
and 0 198 86
the 0 198 86
nascent 0 198 86
Marxism, 0 198 86
but 0 198 86
which 0 198 86
cannot 0 198 86
be 0 198 86
the 0 198 86
last 0 198 86
word. 0 198 86

Neither 0 198 87
embraces 0 198 87
nor 0 198 87
the 0 198 87
ghetto 0 198 87
can 0 198 87
resolve 0 198 87
the 0 198 87
problem 0 198 87
of 0 198 87
[relations 0 198 87
with] 0 198 87
the 0 198 87
modern 0 198 87
world 0 198 87
for 0 198 87
the 0 198 87
Christian. 0 198 87

Hence, 0 198 88
the 0 198 88
'razing 0 198 88
of 0 198 88
the 0 198 88
bastions' 0 198 88
that 0 198 88
Hans 0 198 88
Urs 0 198 88
von 0 198 88
Balthasar 0 198 88
called 0 198 88
for 0 198 88
already 0 198 88
in 0 198 88
1952 0 198 88
was 0 198 88
in 0 198 88
effect 0 198 88
an 0 198 88
urgent 0 198 88
duty. 0 198 88

It 0 198 89
was 0 198 89
necessary 0 198 89
for 0 198 89
her 0 198 89
[the 0 198 89
Church] 0 198 89
to 0 198 89
raze 0 198 89
the 0 198 89
old 0 198 89
bastions 0 198 89
and 0 198 89
confide 0 198 89
only 0 198 89
in 0 198 89
the 0 198 89
protection 0 198 89
of 0 198 89
the 0 198 89
faith, 0 198 89
the 0 198 89
power 0 198 89
of 0 198 89
the 0 198 89
word 0 198 89
that 0 198 89
is 0 198 89
her 0 198 89
unique, 0 198 89
true, 0 198 89
and 0 198 89
permanent 0 198 89
strength. 0 198 89

But 0 198 90
to 0 198 90
raze 0 198 90
the 0 198 90
bastions 0 198 90
cannot 0 198 90
signify 0 198 90
that 0 198 90
she 0 198 90
no 0 198 90
longer 0 198 90
has 0 198 90
anything 0 198 90
to 0 198 90
protect, 0 198 90
or 0 198 90
that 0 198 90
she 0 198 90
can 0 198 90
live 0 198 90
owing 0 198 90
to 0 198 90
different 0 198 90
forces 0 198 90
than 0 198 90
those 0 198 90
that 0 198 90
engendered 0 198 90
her: 0 198 90
the 1 198 90
water 1 198 90
and 1 198 90
the 1 198 90
blood 1 198 90
that 1 198 90
poured 1 198 90
from 1 198 90
the 1 198 90
open 1 198 90
side 1 198 90
of 1 198 90
her 1 198 90
crucified 1 198 90
Lord. 1 198 90

His 0 198 91
was 0 198 91
the 0 198 91
thesis 0 198 91
– 0 198 91
a 0 198 91
mainstay 0 198 91
of 0 198 91
“conservative” 0 198 91
ideology 0 198 91
– 0 198 91
that 0 198 91
the 0 198 91
“real” 0 198 91
Council, 0 198 91
if 0 198 91
only 0 198 91
implemented 0 198 91
properly, 0 198 91
would 0 198 91
be 0 198 91
the 0 198 91
salvation 0 198 91
of 0 198 91
the 0 198 91
Church 0 198 91
and 0 198 91
the 0 198 91
world, 0 198 91
a 0 198 91
theme 0 198 91
he 0 198 91
never 0 198 91
left. 0 198 91

How 0 198 92
ironic 0 198 92
it 0 198 92
must 0 198 92
have 0 198 92
seemed 0 198 92
to 0 198 92
those 0 198 92
who 0 198 92
remembered 0 198 92
this 0 198 92
history 0 198 92
that 0 198 92
Ratzinger 0 198 92
would 0 198 92
himself 0 198 92
be 0 198 92
given 0 198 92
the 0 198 92
office 0 198 92
he 0 198 92
had 0 198 92
“destroyed” 0 198 92
and 0 198 92
would 0 198 92
gain 0 198 92
the 0 198 92
media-generated 0 198 92
reputation 0 198 92
as 0 198 92
an 0 198 92
“arch-conservative”. 1 198 92

And 0 198 93
it 0 198 93
starts 0 198 93
to 0 198 93
suggest 0 198 93
an 0 198 93
answer, 0 198 93
or 0 198 93
at 0 198 93
least 0 198 93
a 0 198 93
line 0 198 93
of 0 198 93
inquiry, 0 198 93
about 0 198 93
why 0 198 93
so 0 198 93
little 0 198 93
was 0 198 93
actually 0 198 93
accomplished 0 198 93
in 0 198 93
his 0 198 93
long 0 198 93
tenure. 0 198 93

With 0 198 94
the 0 198 94
“arch-conservative” 1 198 94
“Rottweiler” 1 198 94
Ratzinger 1 198 94
in 0 198 94
CDF, 0 198 94
why 0 198 94
do 0 198 94
we 0 198 94
have 0 198 94
the 0 198 94
situation 0 198 94
we 0 198 94
have 0 198 94
today? 0 198 94

What 0 198 95
did 0 198 95
he 0 198 95
do 0 198 95
to 0 198 95
stop 0 198 95
the 0 198 95
explosion 0 198 95
of 0 198 95
neo-modernism 0 198 95
– 0 198 95
that 0 198 95
burned 1 198 95
like 1 198 95
an 1 198 95
unchecked 1 198 95
wildfire 1 198 95
throughout 1 198 95
the 1 198 95
Catholic 1 198 95
world 1 198 95
through 0 198 95
the 0 198 95
reign 0 198 95
of 0 198 95
John 0 198 95
Paul 0 198 95
II? 0 198 95

What 0 198 96
did 0 198 96
“silencing” 0 198 96
by 0 198 96
Ratzinger’s 0 198 96
CDF 0 198 96
do 0 198 96
to 0 198 96
stop 0 198 96
Hans 0 198 96
Kung 0 198 96
becoming 0 198 96
a 0 198 96
celebrity 1 198 96
“priest-theologian,” 1 198 96
courted 0 198 96
by 0 198 96
the 0 198 96
media 0 198 96
for 0 198 96
his 0 198 96
loathing 0 198 96
of 0 198 96
Catholicism? 0 198 96

Kung, 0 198 97
who 0 198 97
was 0 198 97
never 0 198 97
removed 0 198 97
from 0 198 97
the 0 198 97
priesthood 0 198 97
despite 0 198 97
his 0 198 97
manifest 0 198 97
heresy? 0 198 97

Can 0 198 98
we 0 198 98
think 0 198 98
of 0 198 98
any 0 198 98
other 0 198 98
names 0 198 98
who 0 198 98
were 0 198 98
corrected 0 198 98
even 0 198 98
to 0 198 98
this 0 198 98
degree? 0 198 98

Precious 0 198 99
few. 0 198 99

But 0 198 100
we 0 198 100
can 0 198 100
certainly 0 198 100
think 0 198 100
of 0 198 100
many, 0 198 100
many 0 198 100
who 0 198 100
spent 0 198 100
their 0 198 100
lives 0 198 100
and 0 198 100
vocations 0 198 100
blatantly 1 198 100

and 1 198 100
undermining 1 198 100
the 0 198 100

bishops 0 198 100
and 0 198 100
cardinals 0 198 100
around 0 198 100
the 0 198 100
world 0 198 100
– 0 198 100
with 0 198 100
never 0 198 100
a 0 198 100

of 0 198 100
protest 0 198 100
from 0 198 100
Rome. 0 198 100

Moreover, 0 198 101
the 0 198 101
scandalous 0 198 101
pack 0 198 101
of 0 198 101
frauds 0 198 101
we 0 198 101
currently 0 198 101
have 0 198 101
in 0 198 101
the 0 198 101
episcopate 0 198 101
is 0 198 101
entirely 0 198 101
the 0 198 101
product 0 198 101
of 0 198 101
the 0 198 101
“arch-conservative” 1 198 101
John 0 198 101
Paul 0 198 101
II 0 198 101
and 0 198 101

Why 0 198 102
did 0 198 102
we 0 198 102
think 0 198 102
that 0 198 102
Ratzinger, 0 198 102
in 0 198 102
this 0 198 102
crucial 0 198 102
role 0 198 102
of 0 198 102
CDF 0 198 102
prefect, 0 198 102
was 0 198 102
a 0 198 102
bulwark 0 198 102
of 0 198 102
orthodoxy? 0 198 102

Is 0 198 103
it 0 198 103
simply 0 198 103
that 0 198 103
we 0 198 103
have 0 198 103
moved 0 198 103
so 0 198 103
far 0 198 103
away 0 198 103
from 0 198 103
the 0 198 103
ancient 0 198 103
Faith 0 198 103
that 0 198 103
we 0 198 103
no 0 198 103
longer 0 198 103
have 0 198 103
a 0 198 103
realistic 0 198 103
notion 0 198 103
of 0 198 103
the 0 198 103
Faith 0 198 103
ourselves 0 198 103
to 0 198 103
make 0 198 103
a 0 198 103
comparison, 0 198 103
to 0 198 103
make 0 198 103
an 0 198 103
objective 0 198 103
judgement? 0 198 103

The 0 198 104
“progressive” 1 198 104
destroyer 1 198 104
of 1 198 104
Ottaviani 1 198 104
inheriting 0 198 104
his 0 198 104
office 0 198 104
and 0 198 104
the 0 198 104
epithet 0 198 104
“arch-conservative”… 1 198 104

Indeed, 0 198 105
Ratzinger 0 198 105
himself 0 198 105
maintained 0 198 105
that 0 198 105
he 0 198 105
had 0 198 105
never 0 198 105
changed 0 198 105
his 0 198 105
theological 0 198 105
opinions. 0 198 105

He 0 198 106
was 0 198 106
to 0 198 106
say 0 198 106
that 0 198 106
it 0 198 106
was 0 198 106
his 0 198 106
old 0 198 106
academic 0 198 106
colleagues 0 198 106
like 0 198 106
Kung 0 198 106
and 0 198 106
Kasper 0 198 106
who 0 198 106
had 0 198 106
moved 0 198 106
further 0 198 106
to 0 198 106
the 0 198 106
ideological 0 198 106
“left” 0 198 106
after 0 198 106
the 0 198 106
1960s 0 198 106
while 0 198 106
he 0 198 106
stayed 0 198 106
in 0 198 106
place. 0 198 106

Perhaps 0 198 107
now, 0 198 107
as 0 198 107
an 0 198 107
answer 0 198 107
that 0 198 107
fits 0 198 107
our 0 198 107
apparently 0 198 107
contradictory 0 198 107
puzzle 0 198 107
pieces, 0 198 107
we 0 198 107
can 0 198 107
finally 0 198 107
accept 0 198 107
his 0 198 107
word 0 198 107
on 0 198 107
this. 0 198 107

Perhaps 0 198 108
the 0 198 108
world 0 198 108
of 0 198 108
Catholic 0 198 108
academic 0 198 108
theology 0 198 108
had 0 198 108
become 0 198 108
so 0 198 108
corrupted 0 198 108
that 0 198 108
a 1 198 108
man 1 198 108
called 1 198 108
“progressive” 1 198 108
in 0 198 108
1963, 0 198 108
but 0 198 108
whose 0 198 108
ideas 0 198 108
remained 0 198 108
the 0 198 108
same, 0 198 108
would 0 198 108
look 0 198 108
like 0 198 108
a 0 198 108
“champion 0 198 108
of 0 198 108
traditional 0 198 108
Catholic 0 198 108
orthodoxy” 0 198 108
by 0 198 108
2005. 0 198 108

Is 0 198 109
this 0 198 109
why 0 198 109
he 0 198 109
resigned? 0 198 109

Is 0 198 110
it 0 198 110
simply 0 198 110
that 0 198 110
his 0 198 110
conception 0 198 110
of 0 198 110
the 0 198 110
Church, 0 198 110
of 0 198 110
the 0 198 110
papacy, 0 198 110
was 0 198 110
never 0 198 110
what 0 198 110
Catholics 0 198 110
believed 0 198 110
about 0 198 110
it? 0 198 110

Perhaps 0 198 111
a 0 198 111
hint 0 198 111
at 0 198 111
the 0 198 111
answer 0 198 111
comes 0 198 111
from 0 198 111
La 0 198 111
Stampa 0 198 111
in 0 198 111
2015 0 198 111
which 0 198 111

some 0 198 111
of 0 198 111

of 0 198 111
Silvano 0 198 111

of 0 198 111
Cardinal 0 198 111
Carlo 0 198 111
Maria 0 198 111
Martini, 0 198 111
the 0 198 111

of 1 198 111
the 1 198 111

Catholic 1 198 111
Church, 1 198 111

the 0 198 111
“Sankt 0 198 111

that 0 198 111
Cardinal 0 198 111

against 0 198 111
Pope 0 198 111
Benedict. 0 198 111

Fausti 0 198 112
said 0 198 112
that 0 198 112
Benedict 0 198 112
met 0 198 112
with 0 198 112
Martini 0 198 112
at 0 198 112
the 0 198 112
bishops’ 0 198 112
palace 0 198 112
of 0 198 112
Milan 0 198 112
in 0 198 112
June 0 198 112
2012. 0 198 112

Martini, 0 198 113
Fausti 0 198 113
said, 0 198 113
urged 0 198 113
Benedict 0 198 113
to 0 198 113
resign 0 198 113
the 0 198 113
papacy. 0 198 113

Apparently 0 198 114
at 0 198 114
the 0 198 114
time 0 198 114
of 0 198 114
his 0 198 114
election 0 198 114
in 0 198 114
2005, 0 198 114
Martini 0 198 114
had 0 198 114
said 0 198 114
it 0 198 114
would 0 198 114
be 0 198 114
his 0 198 114
main 0 198 114
task 0 198 114
to 0 198 114
reform 0 198 114
the 0 198 114
Curia. 0 198 114

By 0 198 115
2012, 0 198 115
this 0 198 115
had 0 198 115
proved 0 198 115
impossible. 0 198 115

Why 0 198 116
would 0 198 116
Benedict 0 198 116
take 0 198 116
advice 0 198 116
from 0 198 116
a 0 198 116
man 0 198 116
like 0 198 116
Martini 0 198 116
– 0 198 116
the 1 198 116
“godfather” 1 198 116
of 1 198 116
the 1 198 116
“liberal 1 198 116
wing” 1 198 116
of 1 198 116
European 1 198 116
Catholicism? 1 198 116

I 0 198 117
think 0 198 117
the 0 198 117
question 0 198 117
would 0 198 117
not 0 198 117
even 0 198 117
occur 0 198 117
to 0 198 117
a 0 198 117
man 0 198 117
like 0 198 117
Ratzinger. 0 198 117

They 0 198 118
were 0 198 118
esteemed 0 198 118
academic 0 198 118
colleagues. 0 198 118

They 0 198 119
were 0 198 119
brothers 0 198 119
of 0 198 119
the 0 198 119
episcopate. 0 198 119

They 0 198 120
were 0 198 120
members 0 198 120
of 0 198 120
the 0 198 120
club. 0 198 120

Any 0 198 121
appearance 0 198 121
of 0 198 121
ideological 0 198 121
division 0 198 121
between 0 198 121
them 0 198 121
was, 0 198 121
in 0 198 121
essence, 0 198 121
a 0 198 121
product 0 198 121
of 0 198 121
the 0 198 121
media 0 198 121
narrative. 0 198 121

Why 0 198 122
wouldn’t 0 198 122
the 0 198 122
pope 0 198 122
take 0 198 122
the 0 198 122
advice 0 198 122
of 0 198 122
his 0 198 122
most 0 198 122
respected 0 198 122
and 0 198 122
senior 0 198 122
cardinal? 0 198 122

Why 0 198 123
is 0 198 123
Walter 0 198 123
Kasper 0 198 123
a 0 198 123
cardinal? 0 198 123

One 0 198 124
of 0 198 124
the 0 198 124
most 0 198 124
prominent 0 198 124
of 0 198 124
those 0 198 124
puzzle 0 198 124
pieces 0 198 124
is 0 198 124
the 0 198 124
apparent 0 198 124
inability 0 198 124
of 0 198 124
these 0 198 124
“conservative” 0 198 124
prelates, 0 198 124
to 0 198 124
detect, 0 198 124
let 0 198 124
alone 0 198 124
effectively 0 198 124
oppose, 0 198 124
these 0 198 124
brazen 1 198 124
enemies 1 198 124
of 1 198 124
the 1 198 124

the 0 198 124

College 0 198 124
of 0 198 124

It 0 198 125
beggars 0 198 125
belief 0 198 125
of 0 198 125
ordinary 0 198 125
people 0 198 125
that, 0 198 125
after 0 198 125
so 0 198 125
many 0 198 125
years 0 198 125
of 0 198 125

and 0 198 125
reading 0 198 125
them, 0 198 125
Ratzinger 0 198 125
would 0 198 125
remain 0 198 125
on 0 198 125
such 0 198 125

how 0 198 126
much 0 198 126
he 0 198 126

quite 0 198 126
a 0 198 126

of 0 198 126
us 0 198 126

the 0 198 127

the 0 198 128
direct 0 198 128
assistance 0 198 128
of 0 198 128
both 0 198 128
John 0 198 128
Paul 0 198 128
II 0 198 128
and 0 198 128
Pope 0 198 128
Benedict. 0 198 128

The 0 198 129
monstrous 0 198 129
debacle 0 198 129
of 0 198 129
Amoris 0 198 129
Laetitia 0 198 129
is 0 198 129
as 0 198 129
much 0 198 129
Kasper’s 0 198 129
work 0 198 129
as 0 198 129
Bergoglio’s. 0 198 129

This 0 198 130
is 0 198 130
a 0 198 130
man 0 198 130
who 0 198 130
has, 0 198 130
for 0 198 130
40 0 198 130
years, 0 198 130
never 0 198 130
troubled 0 198 130
to 0 198 130
hide 0 198 130
his 0 198 130
heterodox 0 198 130
opinions 0 198 130
and 0 198 130
has 0 198 130
devoted 0 198 130
much 0 198 130
of 0 198 130
his 0 198 130
life 0 198 130
to 0 198 130
a 0 198 130
campaign 0 198 130
to 0 198 130
bring 0 198 130
about 0 198 130
precisely 0 198 130
this 0 198 130
outcome. 0 198 130

Jansen 0 198 131
points 0 198 131
out 0 198 131
that 0 198 131
Kasper 0 198 131
had 0 198 131
already 0 198 131
tried 0 198 131
to 0 198 131
bring 0 198 131
out 0 198 131
the 0 198 131
same 0 198 131
proposal 0 198 131
for 0 198 131
Communion 0 198 131
for 0 198 131
divorced 0 198 131
and 0 198 131
remarried 0 198 131
in 0 198 131
1993, 0 198 131
together 0 198 131
with 0 198 131
Karl 0 198 131
Lehmann, 0 198 131
another 1 198 131
“Sankt 1 198 131
Gallen” 1 198 131
member. 1 198 131

This 0 198 132
was 0 198 132
stopped 0 198 132
by 0 198 132
Ratzinger 0 198 132
and 0 198 132
the 0 198 132
CDF. 0 198 132

But 0 198 133
that 0 198 133
raises 0 198 133
the 0 198 133
next 0 198 133
question; 0 198 133
if 0 198 133
Ratzinger 0 198 133
knew 0 198 133
so 0 198 133
well 0 198 133
what 1 198 133
kind 1 198 133
of 1 198 133
creature 1 198 133
Kasper 1 198 133
was, 1 198 133
why 0 198 133
wasn’t 0 198 133
the 0 198 133
next 0 198 133
step 0 198 133
to 0 198 133
pitch 0 198 133
him 0 198 133
out 0 198 133
of 0 198 133
the 0 198 133
episcopate 0 198 133
on 0 198 133
his 0 198 133
ear? 0 198 133

Why 0 198 134
was 0 198 134
he 0 198 134
not 0 198 134
– 0 198 134
at 0 198 134
the 0 198 134
very 0 198 134
least 0 198 134
– 0 198 134
given 0 198 134
the 0 198 134
same 0 198 134
“silencing” 0 198 134
treatment 0 198 134
as 0 198 134
Kung? 0 198 134

Kasper 0 198 135
has 0 198 135
recently 0 198 135
gone 0 198 135
to 0 198 135
the 0 198 135
media 0 198 135
again 0 198 135
to 0 198 135
complain 0 198 135
of 0 198 135
being 0 198 135
called 0 198 135
a 0 198 135
heretic. 0 198 135

But 0 198 136
it’s 0 198 136
a 0 198 136
simple 0 198 136
truth: 0 198 136
he’s 1 198 136
a 1 198 136
heretic. 1 198 136

Everyone 0 198 137
knows 0 198 137
he’s 0 198 137
a 0 198 137
heretic 0 198 137
because 0 198 137
we 0 198 137
have 0 198 137
heard 0 198 137
him 0 198 137
trumpeting 1 198 137
in 1 198 137
his 1 198 137
blatant 1 198 137
heresies 1 198 137
from 1 198 137
every 1 198 137
rooftop 1 198 137
he 1 198 137
could 1 198 137
find 1 198 137
for 0 198 137
decades. 0 198 137

After 0 198 138
openly 0 198 138
working 0 198 138
against 0 198 138
the 0 198 138
Faith, 0 198 138
instead 0 198 138
of 0 198 138
being 0 198 138
demoted, 0 198 138
silenced, 0 198 138
laicised 0 198 138
and/or 0 198 138
excommunicated, 0 198 138
John 0 198 138
Paul 0 198 138
II 0 198 138
made 0 198 138
him 0 198 138
a 0 198 138
cardinal. 0 198 138

Remember 0 198 139
that 0 198 139
his 0 198 139
scheme 0 198 139
to 0 198 139
Amoris-Latitia-ize 0 198 139
the 0 198 139
Church 0 198 139
was 0 198 139
stopped 0 198 139
by 0 198 139
Ratzinger’s 0 198 139
CDF 0 198 139
in 0 198 139
1993. 0 198 139

But 0 198 140
he 0 198 140
was 0 198 140
not 0 198 140
demoted, 0 198 140
reprimanded 0 198 140
or 0 198 140
corrected 0 198 140
in 0 198 140
any 0 198 140
way. 0 198 140

Nor 0 198 141
was 0 198 141
he 0 198 141
removed 0 198 141
from 0 198 141
places 0 198 141
of 0 198 141
influence. 0 198 141

Far 0 198 142
from 0 198 142
it. 0 198 142

In 0 198 143
1994 0 198 143
Kasper 0 198 143
was 0 198 143
inserted 0 198 143
into 0 198 143
the 0 198 143
Vatican 0 198 143
Curia 0 198 143
by 0 198 143
being 0 198 143
named 0 198 143
co-chair 0 198 143
of 0 198 143
the 0 198 143
International 0 198 143
Commission 0 198 143
for 0 198 143
Lutheran-Catholic 0 198 143
Dialogue. 0 198 143

In 0 198 144
1999, 0 198 144
he 0 198 144
made 0 198 144
another 0 198 144
step 0 198 144
up, 0 198 144
being 0 198 144
appointed 0 198 144
secretary 0 198 144
of 0 198 144
the 0 198 144
Pontifical 0 198 144
Council 0 198 144
for 0 198 144
Promoting 0 198 144
Christian 0 198 144
Unity, 0 198 144
the 0 198 144
“ecumenical” 0 198 144
office 0 198 144
where 0 198 144
his 0 198 144
manifest 0 198 144
religious 0 198 144
indifferentism 0 198 144
could 0 198 144
be 0 198 144
given 0 198 144
free 0 198 144
reign. 0 198 144

In 0 198 145
2001, 0 198 145
he 0 198 145
was 0 198 145
made 0 198 145
a 0 198 145
Cardinal-deacon 0 198 145
with 0 198 145
the 0 198 145
awesome 1 198 145
responsibility 1 198 145
of 0 198 145
voting 0 198 145
in 0 198 145
a 0 198 145
Conclave. 0 198 145

Then 0 198 146
Benedict 0 198 146
allowed 0 198 146
him 0 198 146
to 0 198 146
remain 0 198 146
a 0 198 146
cardinal. 0 198 146

And, 0 198 147
as 0 198 147
if 0 198 147
to 0 198 147
add 0 198 147
a 0 198 147
finishing 1 198 147
touch 1 198 147
to 1 198 147
the 1 198 147
poisoned 1 198 147
cake 1 198 147
that 0 198 147
is 0 198 147
Ratzinger’s 0 198 147
involvement 0 198 147
in 0 198 147
the 0 198 147
creation 0 198 147
of 0 198 147
the 0 198 147
New 0 198 147
Catholic 0 198 147
Paradigm, 0 198 147
Benedict 0 198 147
is 0 198 147
now 0 198 147
being 0 198 147
said 0 198 147
to 0 198 147
have 0 198 147
deliberately 0 198 147
timed 0 198 147
his 0 198 147
resignation 0 198 147
in 0 198 147
order 0 198 147
to 0 198 147
allow 0 198 147
his 0 198 147
old 0 198 147
academic 0 198 147
colleague 0 198 147
to 0 198 147
participate 0 198 147
in 0 198 147
the 0 198 147
2013 0 198 147
Conclave. 0 198 147

As 0 198 148
Jansen 0 198 148
pointed 0 198 148
out, 0 198 148
and 0 198 148
Maike 0 198 148
Hickson 0 198 148
quoted 0 198 148
in 0 198 148
a 0 198 148
piece 0 198 148
for 0 198 148
One 0 198 148
Peter 0 198 148
Five, 0 198 148

Cardinal 0 198 149
Kasper 0 198 149
barely 0 198 149
even 0 198 149
made 0 198 149
it 0 198 149
into 0 198 149
the 0 198 149
last 0 198 149
conclave, 0 198 149
because 0 198 149
he 0 198 149
had 0 198 149
just 0 198 149
turned 0 198 149
80 0 198 149
years 0 198 149
of 0 198 149
age. 0 198 149

But 0 198 150
since 0 198 150
the 0 198 150
date 0 198 150
of 0 198 150
the 0 198 150
death 0 198 150
(or 0 198 150
abdication, 0 198 150
as 0 198 150
it 0 198 150
was 0 198 150
the 0 198 150
case 0 198 150
in 0 198 150
2013) 0 198 150
of 0 198 150
the 0 198 150
pope 0 198 150
is 0 198 150
decisive, 0 198 150
he 0 198 150
was 0 198 150
still 0 198 150
able 0 198 150
to 0 198 150
attend 0 198 150
and 0 198 150
vote 0 198 150
in 0 198 150
that 0 198 150
election. 0 198 150

(As 0 198 151
some 0 198 151
observers 0 198 151
noted, 0 198 151
it 0 198 151
was 0 198 151
a 0 198 151
generous 0 198 151
gesture 0 198 151
toward 0 198 151
Cardinal 0 198 151
Kasper 0 198 151
that 0 198 151
Pope 0 198 151
Benedict 0 198 151
XVI 0 198 151
had 0 198 151
decided 0 198 151
to 0 198 151
retire 0 198 151
in 0 198 151
due 0 198 151
time.) 0 198 151

Excuse 0 198 152
me 0 198 152
Maike, 0 198 152
but 0 198 152
I 0 198 152
don’t 0 198 152
think 0 198 152
this 0 198 152
is 0 198 152
a 0 198 152
parenthetical 0 198 152
issue. 0 198 152

Is 1 198 153
it 1 198 153
any 1 198 153
wonder 1 198 153
that 1 198 153
so 1 198 153
many 1 198 153
Catholics 1 198 153
have 1 198 153
become 1 198 153
disaffected? 1 198 153

Cardinal 0 198 154
Ratzinger, 0 198 154
Pope 0 198 154
“Emeritus” 0 198 154
Benedict 0 198 154
– 0 198 154
whatever 1 198 154
you 1 198 154
want 1 198 154
to 1 198 154
call 1 198 154
yourself 1 198 154
– 0 198 154
I 0 198 154
have 0 198 154
one 0 198 154
question 0 198 154
that 0 198 154
I 0 198 154
would 0 198 154
really 0 198 154
like 0 198 154
you 0 198 154
to 0 198 154
answer: 0 198 154
Why 1 198 154
is 1 198 154
this 1 198 154
man 1 198 154
still 1 198 154
a 1 198 154
cardinal? 1 198 154

Why 1 198 155
is 1 198 155
he 1 198 155
still 1 198 155
a 1 198 155
bishop? 1 198 155

Why 1 198 156
is 1 198 156
he 1 198 156
still 1 198 156
allowed 1 198 156
to 1 198 156
call 1 198 156
himself 1 198 156
a 1 198 156
“Catholic 1 198 156
theologian”? 1 198 156

Why 1 198 157
did 1 198 157
you, 1 198 157
apparently 1 198 157
deliberately, 1 198 157
ensure 1 198 157
that 1 198 157
he 1 198 157
was 1 198 157
able 1 198 157
to 1 198 157
enter 1 198 157
the 1 198 157
Conclave 1 198 157
to 1 198 157
decide 1 198 157
who 1 198 157
your 1 198 157
successor 1 198 157
was 1 198 157
going 1 198 157
to 1 198 157
be? 1 198 157

Doesn’t 0 198 158
anyone 0 198 158
else 0 198 158
want 0 198 158
to 0 198 158
know 0 198 158
this? 0 198 158

Don’t 0 198 159
we 0 198 159
all 0 198 159
want 0 198 159
to 0 198 159
know 0 198 159
why 0 198 159
Hans 0 198 159
Kung 0 198 159
is 0 198 159
still 0 198 159
a 0 198 159
priest? 0 198 159

Why 0 198 160
was 0 198 160
Cardinal 0 198 160
Mahony 0 198 160
allowed 0 198 160
to 0 198 160
retire 0 198 160
in 0 198 160
good 0 198 160
standing? 0 198 160

Why 0 198 161
a 0 198 161
man 0 198 161
like 0 198 161
Weakland, 0 198 161
the 0 198 161
active 1 198 161
homosexual 1 198 161
who 0 198 161
paid 0 198 161
off 0 198 161
his 0 198 161
ex-lover, 0 198 161
was 0 198 161
not 0 198 161
excommunicated? 0 198 161

What 0 198 162
are 0 198 162
the 0 198 162
names 0 198 162
we 0 198 162
all 0 198 162
remember, 0 198 162
just 0 198 162
off 0 198 162

I 0 198 163
sometimes 0 198 163
wonder 0 198 163
how 0 198 163
long 0 198 163
that 0 198 163
list 0 198 163
is 0 198 163
going 0 198 163
to 0 198 163
be 0 198 163
when 0 198 163
this 0 198 163
is 0 198 163
all 0 198 163
over. 0 198 163

For 0 198 164
fifty 0 198 164
years 0 198 164
Catholics 0 198 164
have 0 198 164
wanted 0 198 164
to 0 198 164
know 0 198 164
why 0 198 164
nothing 0 198 164
was 0 198 164
ever 0 198 164
done, 0 198 164
as 0 198 164
these 0 198 164
wolves 1 198 164
in 1 198 164
the 1 198 164
episcopate 1 198 164
were 0 198 164
allowed, 0 198 164
year 0 198 164
after 0 198 164
year 0 198 164
to 0 198 164
continue 0 198 164
attacking 0 198 164
the 0 198 164
Church. 0 198 164

Why 1 198 165
have 1 198 165
we 1 198 165
so 1 198 165
often 1 198 165
seen 1 198 165
these 1 198 165
men 1 198 165
– 1 198 165
compromised 1 198 165
intellectually 1 198 165
and 1 198 165
morally 1 198 165
– 1 198 165
elevated 1 198 165
to 1 198 165
superior 1 198 165
rank, 1 198 165
despite 1 198 165
the 1 198 165
incredible 1 198 165
brazenness 1 198 165
of 1 198 165

who 0 198 168
openly 0 198 168

for 0 198 168

abolition 0 198 168
of 0 198 168
Catholic 0 198 168
moral 0 198 168
teaching: 0 198 168
“It 0 198 168
was 0 198 168
characteristic 0 198 168
of 0 198 168

John 0 198 168

II 0 198 168
himself 0 198 168

of 0 198 168
them 0 198 168
their 0 198 168

When 0 198 169
journalists 0 198 169
talk 0 198 169
about 0 198 169
Catholicism, 0 198 169
they 0 198 169
often 0 198 169
speak 0 198 169
of 0 198 169
a 0 198 169
man 0 198 169
like 0 198 169
Kasper 0 198 169
being 0 198 169
– 0 198 169
as 0 198 169
his 0 198 169

supposed 0 198 169
to 0 198 169

it 0 198 169

the 0 198 169

a 0 198 170

they’re 0 198 170
both 0 198 170
Catholic. 0 198 170

Steve 0 198 171
Skojec 0 198 171
told 0 198 171
me 0 198 171
that 0 198 171
our 0 198 171
willingness 0 198 171
to 0 198 171
go 0 198 171
along 0 198 171

the 0 198 171
whole 0 198 171
“emeritus 1 198 171
pope” 1 198 171
charade 1 198 171
was 0 198 171
an 0 198 171
error: 0 198 171
“I 0 198 171
think 0 198 171
the 0 198 171

is 0 198 171
that 0 198 171
we 0 198 171
all 0 198 171
went 0 198 171

In 0 198 171
fact, 0 198 171
I 0 198 171
am 0 198 171
starting 0 198 171
to 0 198 171

that 0 198 171
the 0 198 171

has 0 198 171
been 0 198 171
a 0 198 171
grave 0 198 171
error. 0 198 171

By 0 198 172
playing 0 198 172
along, 0 198 172
by 0 198 172
pretending 0 198 172
that 0 198 172
we 0 198 172
could 0 198 172
be 0 198 172
“conservative 0 198 172
Catholics” 0 198 172
in 0 198 172
this 0 198 172
New 0 198 172
Paradigm 0 198 172
that 0 198 172
also 0 198 172
includes 0 198 172
“liberal 0 198 172
Catholics” 0 198 172
we 0 198 172
have 0 198 172
helped 0 198 172
them 0 198 172
perpetrate 0 198 172
one 0 198 172
the 0 198 172
most 0 198 172
monstrous 0 198 172
frauds 0 198 172
in 0 198 172
human 0 198 172
history. 0 198 172

Because 0 198 173
of 0 198 173
this 0 198 173
schizophrenic 1 198 173
mindset 1 198 173
of 1 198 173
the 1 198 173
Church’s 1 198 173
leadership 1 198 173
since 0 198 173
1965, 0 198 173
we 0 198 173
have 0 198 173
all 0 198 173
come 0 198 173
to 0 198 173
accept 0 198 173
the 0 198 173
underlying 0 198 173
premise; 0 198 173
that 0 198 173
the 0 198 173
Church 0 198 173
is 0 198 173
a 0 198 173
“big 0 198 173
umbrella” 0 198 173
with 0 198 173
plenty 0 198 173
of 0 198 173
room 0 198 173
for 0 198 173
people 0 198 173
of 0 198 173
all 0 198 173
personal 0 198 173
opinions, 0 198 173
that 0 198 173
such 0 198 173
issues 0 198 173
as 0 198 173
liturgy 0 198 173
are 0 198 173
matters 0 198 173
of 0 198 173
personal 0 198 173
“taste” 0 198 173
…that 0 198 173
two 0 198 173
opposed 0 198 173
things 0 198 173
can 0 198 173
both 0 198 173
be 0 198 173
Catholic 0 198 173
truth. 0 198 173

This 0 198 174
schizophrenia 1 198 174
is 0 198 174
the 0 198 174
model 0 198 174
under 0 198 174
which 0 198 174
“conservatives” 0 198 174
have 0 198 174
operated 0 198 174
all 0 198 174
this 0 198 174
time, 0 198 174
and 0 198 174
by 0 198 174
which 0 198 174
they 0 198 174
have 0 198 174
judged 0 198 174
a 0 198 174
man 0 198 174
like 0 198 174
Joseph 0 198 174
Ratzinger 0 198 174
to 0 198 174
be 0 198 174
a 0 198 174
“conservative 1 198 174
champion 1 198 174
of 1 198 174
orthodoxy.” 1 198 174
And 0 198 174
what 0 198 174
has 0 198 174
this 0 198 174
achieved? 0 198 174

It 0 198 175
created 0 198 175
cover 0 198 175
for 0 198 175
the 0 198 175
men 0 198 175
of 0 198 175
Kasper’s 0 198 175
clique 0 198 175
to 0 198 175
maneuver 0 198 175
their 0 198 175
man 0 198 175
on 0 198 175
the 0 198 175
throne 0 198 175
of 0 198 175
Peter 0 198 175
five 0 198 175
years 0 198 175
ago. 0 198 175

And 0 198 176
just 0 198 176
like 0 198 176
that, 0 198 176
the 0 198 176
jargon 0 198 176
of 0 198 176
“tolerance” 0 198 176
and 0 198 176
the 0 198 176
“big 0 198 176
umbrella” 0 198 176
is 0 198 176
over 0 198 176
and 0 198 176
the 0 198 176
purge 0 198 176
of 0 198 176
faithful, 0 198 176
believing 0 198 176
Catholic 0 198 176
religious, 0 198 176
seminarians, 0 198 176
priests, 0 198 176
and 0 198 176
academics 0 198 176
has 0 198 176
begun. 0 198 176

As 0 198 177
it 0 198 177
had 0 198 177
to. 0 198 177

They, 0 198 178
at 0 198 178
least, 0 198 178
do 0 198 178
not 0 198 178
harbour 0 198 178
this 0 198 178
insane 0 198 178
contradiction, 0 198 178
and 0 198 178
understand 0 198 178
– 0 198 178
and 0 198 178
frequently 0 198 178
say 0 198 178
out 0 198 178
loud 0 198 178
– 0 198 178
that 0 198 178
the 0 198 178
New 0 198 178
Paradigm 0 198 178
and 0 198 178
the 0 198 178
Catholic 0 198 178
Church 0 198 178
are 0 198 178
not 0 198 178
the 0 198 178
same. 0 198 178

And 0 198 179
their 0 198 179
New 0 198 179
Church 0 198 179
is 0 198 179
the 0 198 179
only 0 198 179
one 0 198 179
left. 0 198 179

For 0 198 180
five 0 198 180
decades 0 198 180
we 1 198 180
played 1 198 180
the 1 198 180
Anglican 1 198 180
game; 1 198 180
as 0 198 180
long 0 198 180
as 0 198 180
we 0 198 180
don’t 0 198 180
talk 0 198 180
about 0 198 180
it, 0 198 180
there 0 198 180
isn’t 0 198 180
a 0 198 180
problem. 0 198 180

Ottaviani’s 0 198 181
Holy 0 198 181
Office 0 198 181
and 0 198 181
schema 0 198 181
were 0 198 181
the 1 198 181
last 1 198 181
gasp 1 198 181
of 1 198 181
the 1 198 181
old 1 198 181
Church 1 198 181
– 0 198 181
and 0 198 181
as 0 198 181
de 0 198 181
Lubac 0 198 181
said 0 198 181
above, 0 198 181
it 0 198 181
was 0 198 181
killed 0 198 181
by 0 198 181
Joseph 0 198 181
Ratzinger. 0 198 181

We 0 198 182
had 0 198 182
a 0 198 182
long 0 198 182
hiatus 0 198 182
in 0 198 182
which 0 198 182
the 0 198 182
popes 0 198 182
pretended 0 198 182
nothing 0 198 182
essential 0 198 182
had 0 198 182
changed, 0 198 182
while 0 198 182
the 0 198 182
institution 0 198 182
around 0 198 182
them 0 198 182
fell 0 198 182
to 0 198 182
the 0 198 182
New 0 198 182
Paradigm, 0 198 182
until 0 198 182
the 0 198 182
papacy 0 198 182
was 0 198 182
the 0 198 182
only 0 198 182
thing 0 198 182
left. 0 198 182

One 0 198 183
of 0 198 183
the 0 198 183
things 0 198 183
I’ve 0 198 183
been 0 198 183
saying 0 198 183
is 0 198 183
a 0 198 183
blessing 0 198 183
in 0 198 183
disguise, 0 198 183
and 0 198 183
an 0 198 183
enormous 0 198 183
relief, 0 198 183
about 0 198 183
the 0 198 183
Bergoglian 0 198 183
era 0 198 183
is 0 198 183
that 0 198 183
we 0 198 183
can 0 198 183
finally 0 198 183
leave 0 198 183
behind 0 198 183
us 0 198 183
the 0 198 183
absurd 0 198 183
situation 0 198 183
of 0 198 183
the 0 198 183
Wojtyla/Ratzinger 0 198 183
era. 0 198 183

We 0 198 184
were 0 198 184
expected 0 198 184
for 0 198 184
all 0 198 184
those 0 198 184
years 0 198 184
to 0 198 184
pretend 0 198 184
we 0 198 184
were 0 198 184
in 0 198 184
the 0 198 184
“New 0 198 184
Springtime 0 198 184
of 0 198 184
Vatican 0 198 184
II,” 0 198 184
while 0 198 184
we 0 198 184
watched 0 198 184
these 0 198 184
wolves 1 198 184
in 1 198 184
shepherds’ 1 198 184
clothing 1 198 184
eating 1 198 184
the 1 198 184
sheep. 1 198 184

Now 0 198 185
we 0 198 185
can, 0 198 185
at 0 198 185
least, 0 198 185
finally 0 198 185
stop 0 198 185
pretending 0 198 185
that 0 198 185
everything 0 198 185
is 0 198 185
just 0 198 185
dandy 0 198 185
under 0 198 185
the 0 198 185
New 1 198 185
Paradigm 1 198 185
of 1 198 185
Merciful 1 198 185
Conciliar 1 198 185
Wonderfulness. 1 198 185

For 0 198 186
those 0 198 186
still 0 198 186
wondering, 0 198 186
Bergoglio 0 198 186
isn’t 0 198 186
a 0 198 186
shock, 0 198 186
he 0 198 186
isn’t 0 198 186
even 0 198 186
a 0 198 186
surprise; 0 198 186
he’s 0 198 186
just 0 198 186
the 0 198 186
logical 0 198 186
end 0 198 186
result. 0 198 186

This 0 198 187
pontificate 0 198 187
isn’t 0 198 187
an 0 198 187
anomaly; 0 198 187

as 0 199 24
special 0 199 24

Wednesday’s 0 199 25

a 0 199 25
reminder 0 199 25
of 0 199 25
Trump’s 0 199 25
unabated 1 199 25

at 0 199 25

from 0 199 25

of 1 199 26

earliest 1 199 26
and 1 199 26
most 1 199 26
active 1 199 26
supporters, 1 199 26

investigation 0 199 26
of 0 199 26

campaign. 0 199 26

He 0 199 27
announced 0 199 27
the 0 199 27
decision 0 199 27
after 0 199 27
controversy 0 199 27
over 0 199 27

Two 1 199 28
months 1 199 28
ago, 1 199 28
Trump 1 199 28
tweeted 1 199 28
that 1 199 28
he 1 199 28
should 1 199 28
have 1 199 28
chosen 1 199 28
a 1 199 28
different 1 199 28
person 1 199 28
as 1 199 28
attorney 1 199 28
general 1 199 28
who 1 199 28
wouldn’t 1 199 28
have 1 199 28
needed 1 199 28
to 1 199 28
recuse 1 199 28
himself. 1 199 28

“I 1 199 29
wish 1 199 29
I 1 199 29
did!” 1 199 29
he 1 199 29
wrote. 1 199 29

In 1 199 30
his 1 199 30
tweets, 1 199 30
Trump 1 199 30
also 1 199 30
quoted 1 199 30
criticism 1 199 30
of 1 199 30
the 1 199 30
investigation 1 199 30
from 1 199 30

frequently 1 199 30
defends 1 199 30
Trump 1 199 30
on 1 199 30
television. 1 199 30

In 1 199 31
an 1 199 31
interview 1 199 31
with 1 199 31
the 1 199 31
Los 1 199 31
Angeles 1 199 31
Times, 1 199 31
Dershowitz 1 199 31
said 1 199 31
he 1 199 31
does 1 199 31
not 1 199 31
believe 1 199 31
Sessions 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
the 1 199 31
authority 1 199 31
to 1 199 31
end 1 199 31
the 1 199 31
probe. 1 199 31

“You 1 199 32
can’t 1 199 32
be 1 199 32
both 1 199 32
recused 1 199 32
and 1 199 32
making 1 199 32
decisions 1 199 32
about 1 199 32
the 1 199 32
investigation,” 1 199 32
he 1 199 32
said. 1 199 32

But 0 199 33
Dershowitz 0 199 33
also 0 199 33
cast 0 199 33
doubt 0 199 33
on 0 199 33
whether 0 199 33
Trump’s 0 199 33
tweets 0 199 33
can 0 199 33
be 0 199 33
seen 0 199 33
as 0 199 33
an 0 199 33
act 0 199 33
of 0 199 33
obstruction. 0 199 33

“You 0 199 34
cannot 0 199 34
obstruct 0 199 34
justice 0 199 34
by 0 199 34
openly 0 199 34
exercising 0 199 34
your 0 199 34
First 0 199 34
Amendment 0 199 34
rights 0 199 34
and 0 199 34
openly 0 199 34
criticizing 0 199 34
a 0 199 34
prosecution, 0 199 34
whether 0 199 34
you’re 0 199 34
right 0 199 34
or 0 199 34
wrong,” 0 199 34
he 0 199 34
said. 0 199 34

“Obstruction 0 199 35
of 0 199 35
justice 0 199 35
is 0 199 35
generally 0 199 35
committed 0 199 35
behind 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
scenes, 0 199 35
so 0 199 35
I 0 199 35
think 0 199 35
both 0 199 35
sides 0 199 35
are 0 199 35
a 0 199 35
little 0 199 35
overwrought 0 199 35
here.” 0 199 35

Stephen 0 199 36
Vladeck, 0 199 36
a 0 199 36
University 0 199 36
of 0 199 36
Texas 0 199 36
law 0 199 36
professor, 0 199 36
agreed 0 199 36
that 0 199 36
Sessions 0 199 36
cannot 0 199 36
stop 0 199 36
the 0 199 36
Russia 0 199 36
investigation 0 199 36
given 0 199 36
that 0 199 36
he 0 199 36
recused 0 199 36
himself. 0 199 36

“The 0 199 37
president, 0 199 37
intentionally 0 199 37
or 0 199 37
not, 0 199 37
is 0 199 37
misdirecting 1 199 37
his 1 199 37
ire,” 1 199 37
Vladeck 0 199 37
said. 0 199 37

If 0 199 38
Trump 0 199 38
wanted 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
use 0 199 38
his 0 199 38
power 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
end 0 199 38
the 0 199 38
probe, 0 199 38
he 0 199 38
would 0 199 38
have 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
give 0 199 38

according 0 199 38
to 0 199 38
Vladeck. 0 199 38

after 0 201 5

to 0 201 9

concluded. 0 201 10

Kavanaugh 1 201 11
stole 1 201 11
the 1 201 11
show. 1 201 11

The 0 201 12
judge 0 201 12
forcefully 0 201 12
stood 0 201 12
up 0 201 12
for 0 201 12
himself 0 201 12
as 0 201 12
his 0 201 12
voice 0 201 12
trembled 1 201 12
with 1 201 12
righteous 1 201 12
indignation, 1 201 12
calling 0 201 12
out 0 201 12
Democratic 0 201 12
senators 0 201 12
for 0 201 12
plotting 0 201 12
against 0 201 12
him. 0 201 12

The 0 201 13
behavior 0 201 13
of 0 201 13
several 0 201 13
of 0 201 13
the 0 201 13
Democratic 0 201 13
members 0 201 13
of 0 201 13
this 0 201 13
committee 0 201 13
at 0 201 13
my 0 201 13
hearing 0 201 13
a 0 201 13
few 0 201 13
weeks 0 201 13
ago 0 201 13
was 0 201 13
an 0 201 13
embarrassment. 0 201 13

But 0 201 14
at 0 201 14
least 0 201 14
it 0 201 14
was 0 201 14
just 0 201 14
a 0 201 14
good 0 201 14
old-fashioned 0 201 14
attempt 0 201 14
at 0 201 14
Borking. 0 201 14

Those 0 201 15
efforts 0 201 15
didn't 0 201 15
work. 0 201 15

When 0 201 16
I 0 201 16
did 0 201 16
at 0 201 16
least 0 201 16
okay 0 201 16
enough 0 201 16
at 0 201 16
the 0 201 16
hearings 0 201 16
that 0 201 16
it 0 201 16
looked 0 201 16
like 0 201 16
I 0 201 16
might 0 201 16
actually 0 201 16
get 0 201 16
confirmed, 0 201 16
a 0 201 16
new 0 201 16
tactic 0 201 16
was 0 201 16
needed. 0 201 16

Some 0 201 17
of 0 201 17
you 0 201 17
were 0 201 17
lying 0 201 17
in 0 201 17
wait 0 201 17
and 0 201 17
had 0 201 17
it 0 201 17
ready. 0 201 17

This 0 201 18
first 0 201 18
allegation 0 201 18
was 0 201 18
held 0 201 18
in 0 201 18
secret 0 201 18
for 0 201 18
weeks 0 201 18
by 0 201 18
a 0 201 18
Democratic 0 201 18
member 0 201 18
of 0 201 18
this 0 201 18
committee, 0 201 18
and 0 201 18
by 0 201 18
staff. 0 201 18

It 0 201 19
would 0 201 19
be 0 201 19
needed 0 201 19
only 0 201 19
if 0 201 19
you 0 201 19
couldn't 0 201 19
take 0 201 19
me 0 201 19
out 0 201 19
on 0 201 19
the 0 201 19
merits. 0 201 19

When 0 201 20
it 0 201 20
was 0 201 20
needed, 0 201 20
this 0 201 20
allegation 0 201 20
was 0 201 20
unleashed 0 201 20
and 0 201 20
publicly 0 201 20
deployed 0 201 20
over 0 201 20
Dr. 0 201 20
Ford's 0 201 20
wishes. 0 201 20

And 0 201 21
then, 0 201 21
and 1 201 21
then 1 201 21
as 0 201 21
no 0 201 21
doubt 0 201 21
was 0 201 21
expected, 0 201 21
if 0 201 21
not 0 201 21
planned, 0 201 21
came 0 201 21
a 0 201 21
long 0 201 21
series 0 201 21
of 0 201 21
false 0 201 21
last-minute 1 201 21
smears 1 201 21
designed 0 201 21
to 0 201 21
scare 0 201 21
me 0 201 21
and 0 201 21
drive 0 201 21
me 0 201 21
out 0 201 21
of 0 201 21
the 0 201 21
process 0 201 21
before 0 201 21
any 0 201 21
hearing 0 201 21
occurred. 0 201 21

Afraid 1 201 22
of 1 201 22
their 1 201 22
own 1 201 22
shadows, 1 201 22
committee 0 201 22
Republicans 0 201 22
didn’t 0 201 22
relish 0 201 22
the 0 201 22
prospect 0 201 22
of 0 201 22
their 0 201 22
all-male 1 201 22
team 1 201 22
of 0 201 22
11 0 201 22
senators 0 201 22
questioning 0 201 22
a 0 201 22
woman 0 201 22
so 0 201 22
they 0 201 22
hired 0 201 22
sex-crimes 0 201 22
prosecutor 0 201 22
Rachel 0 201 22
Mitchell 0 201 22
of 0 201 22
Maricopa 0 201 22
County, 0 201 22
Arizona, 0 201 22
to 0 201 22
examine 0 201 22
Ford. 0 201 22

Opinions 0 201 23
differ 0 201 23
widely 0 201 23
on 0 201 23
how 0 201 23
Mitchell 0 201 23
performed. 0 201 23

She 0 201 24
tiptoed 0 201 24
around 0 201 24
the 0 201 24
alleged 0 201 24
sexual 0 201 24
assault 0 201 24
itself, 0 201 24
instead 0 201 24
focusing 0 201 24
on 0 201 24
process-related 0 201 24
questions, 0 201 24
presumably 0 201 24
in 0 201 24
an 0 201 24
effort 0 201 24
to 0 201 24
show 0 201 24
undecided 0 201 24
senators 0 201 24
how 0 201 24
Ford 0 201 24
and 0 201 24
her 0 201 24
handlers 0 201 24
have 0 201 24
been 0 201 24
unfairly 0 201 24
manipulating 0 201 24
the 0 201 24
process. 0 201 24

In 0 201 25
much 0 201 25
of 0 201 25
her 0 201 25
testimony, 0 201 25
Ford 0 201 25
came 0 201 25
across 0 201 25
as 0 201 25
presentable 0 201 25
and 0 201 25
seemingly 0 201 25
credible, 0 201 25
though 0 201 25
vague 0 201 25
and 0 201 25
sometimes 0 201 25
evasive, 0 201 25
her 0 201 25
ridiculous 1 201 25
overall 1 201 25
story 1 201 25
notwithstanding. 0 201 25

Ford 0 201 26
did 0 201 26
well 0 201 26
enough 0 201 26
that 0 201 26
during 0 201 26
the 0 201 26
break 0 201 26
between 0 201 26
her 0 201 26
testimony 0 201 26
and 0 201 26
Kavanaugh’s, 0 201 26
commentators 0 201 26
on 0 201 26
Fox 0 201 26
News 0 201 26
such 0 201 26
as 0 201 26
Brit 0 201 26
Hume 0 201 26
and 0 201 26
Andrew 0 201 26
Napolitano 0 201 26
were 0 201 26
openly 0 201 26
musing 0 201 26
about 0 201 26
the 0 201 26
nominee 0 201 26
withdrawing, 0 201 26
opinions 0 201 26
that 0 201 26
were 0 201 26
sharply 0 201 26
reversed 0 201 26
after 0 201 26
the 0 201 26
nominee 0 201 26
completed 0 201 26
his 0 201 26
testimony 0 201 26
hours 0 201 26
later. 0 201 26

It’s 0 201 27
not 0 201 27
that 0 201 27
Mitchell 0 201 27
did 0 201 27
a 0 201 27
bad 0 201 27
job 0 201 27
creating 0 201 27
an 0 201 27
inventory 0 201 27
of 0 201 27
the 0 201 27
irregularities 0 201 27
in 0 201 27
the 0 201 27
process 0 201 27
and 0 201 27
of 0 201 27
the 0 201 27
odd 0 201 27
behavior 0 201 27
of 0 201 27
Ford 0 201 27
and 0 201 27
her 0 201 27
lawyers. 0 201 27

She 0 201 28
could 0 201 28
do 0 201 28
little 0 201 28
else. 0 201 28

She 0 201 29
had 0 201 29
many 0 201 29
restrictions 0 201 29
placed 0 201 29
upon 0 201 29
her 0 201 29
and 0 201 29
was 0 201 29
only 0 201 29
allowed 0 201 29
to 0 201 29
question 0 201 29
Ford 0 201 29
for 0 201 29
minutes 0 201 29
at 0 201 29
a 0 201 29
time 0 201 29
before 0 201 29
surrendering 0 201 29
the 0 201 29
floor 0 201 29
to 0 201 29
the 0 201 29
next 0 201 29
committee 0 201 29
Democrat. 0 201 29

As 0 201 30
commentator 0 201 30
Sean 0 201 30
Davis 0 201 30
tweeted: 0 201 30

“Hard 1 201 31
to 1 201 31
do 1 201 31
much 1 201 31
else 1 201 31
when 1 201 31
the 1 201 31
witness 1 201 31
conveniently 1 201 31
has 1 201 31
no 1 201 31
corroborating 1 201 31
evidence, 1 201 31
no 1 201 31
memory 1 201 31
of 1 201 31
any 1 201 31
verifiable 1 201 31
facts 1 201 31
of 1 201 31
what 1 201 31
happened, 1 201 31
and 1 201 31
everyone 1 201 31
she 1 201 31
says 1 201 31
was 1 201 31
present 1 201 31
at 1 201 31
the 1 201 31
alleged 1 201 31
incident--even 1 201 31
her 1 201 31
best 1 201 31
friend--has 1 201 31
denied 1 201 31
it.” 1 201 31

Nonetheless, 0 201 32
Mitchell’s 0 201 32
questioning 0 201 32
came 0 201 32
across 0 201 32
at 0 201 32
times 0 201 32
as 0 201 32
perfunctory, 0 201 32
leading 0 201 32
many 0 201 32
observers 0 201 32
to 0 201 32
conclude 0 201 32
that 0 201 32
Republicans 0 201 32
threw 0 201 32
away 0 201 32
a 0 201 32
valuable 0 201 32
opportunity 0 201 32
by 0 201 32
using 0 201 32
her 0 201 32
as 0 201 32
a 0 201 32
stand-in. 0 201 32

She 0 201 33
failed 0 201 33
to 0 201 33
lay 0 201 33
a 0 201 33
glove 0 201 33
on 0 201 33
a 0 201 33
witness 0 201 33
whose 0 201 33
implausible, 0 201 33
internally 0 201 33
contradictory 0 201 33
story 0 201 33
cried 1 201 33
out 1 201 33
for 1 201 33
vigorous 1 201 33
cross-examination. 1 201 33

In 0 201 34
the 0 201 34
end 0 201 34
the 0 201 34
too-deferential, 0 201 34
easygoing 0 201 34
Mitchell 0 201 34
failed 0 201 34
to 0 201 34
provide 0 201 34
much, 0 201 34
if 0 201 34
anything, 0 201 34
in 0 201 34
the 0 201 34
way 0 201 34
of 0 201 34
evidence 0 201 34
against 0 201 34
Ford 0 201 34
or 0 201 34
in 0 201 34
favor 0 201 34
of 0 201 34
Kavanaugh. 0 201 34

Whether 0 201 35
her 0 201 35
work 0 201 35
will 0 201 35
bring 0 201 35
over 0 201 35
fence-sitting 0 201 35
senators 0 201 35
to 0 201 35
Kavanaugh’s 0 201 35
side 0 201 35
remains 0 201 35
to 0 201 35
be 0 201 35
seen. 0 201 35

Like 0 201 36
other 0 201 36
Democrats, 0 201 36
Sen. 0 201 36
Mazie 0 201 36
Hirono 0 201 36
of 0 201 36
Hawaii 0 201 36
tried 0 201 36
to 0 201 36
help 0 201 36
Ford, 0 201 36
lobbing 1 201 36
her 1 201 36
softballs. 1 201 36

After 0 201 37
saying 0 201 37
she 0 201 37
thought 0 201 37
she 0 201 37
knew 0 201 37
what 0 201 37
Mitchell 0 201 37
was 0 201 37
trying 0 201 37
to 0 201 37
get 0 201 37
at 0 201 37
in 0 201 37
her 0 201 37
questions, 0 201 37
the 0 201 37
senator 0 201 37
said, 0 201 37
“so 0 201 37
I'll 0 201 37
just 0 201 37
ask 0 201 37
you 0 201 37
very 0 201 37
plainly, 0 201 37
Dr. 0 201 37
Ford, 0 201 37
is 1 201 37
there 1 201 37
a 1 201 37
political 1 201 37
motivation 1 201 37
for 1 201 37
your 1 201 37
coming 1 201 37
forward 1 201 37
with 1 201 37
your 1 201 37
account 1 201 37
of 1 201 37
the 1 201 37
assault 1 201 37
by 1 201 37
Brett 1 201 37
Kavanaugh?” 1 201 37

“No, 0 201 38
and 0 201 38
I'd 0 201 38
like 0 201 38
to 0 201 38
reiterate 0 201 38
that 0 201 38
again, 0 201 38
I 0 201 38
was 0 201 38
trying 0 201 38
to 0 201 38
get 0 201 38
the 0 201 38
information 0 201 38
to 0 201 38
you 0 201 38
while 0 201 38
there 0 201 38
was 0 201 38
still 0 201 38
a 0 201 38
list 0 201 38
of 0 201 38
other 0 201 38
what 0 201 38
looked 0 201 38
like 0 201 38
equally-qualified 0 201 38
candidates,” 0 201 38
Ford 0 201 38
replied. 0 201 38

When 0 201 39
Sen. 0 201 39
Dick 0 201 39
Durbin 0 201 39
(D-Ill.) 0 201 39
asked 0 201 39
Ford 0 201 39
“with 0 201 39
what 0 201 39
degree 0 201 39
of 0 201 39
certainty 0 201 39
do 0 201 39
you 0 201 39
believe 0 201 39
Brett 0 201 39
Kavanaugh 0 201 39
assaulted 0 201 39
you?” 0 201 39
Ford 0 201 39
replied, 0 201 39
“one 0 201 39
hundred 0 201 39
percent.” 0 201 39

Strangely, 0 201 40
Ford 1 201 40
has 1 201 40
a 1 201 40
bad 1 201 40
long-term 1 201 40
memory 1 201 40
and 1 201 40
a 1 201 40
bad 1 201 40
short-term 1 201 40
memory. 1 201 40

She 0 201 41
doesn’t 0 201 41
know 0 201 41
when 0 201 41
or 0 201 41
where 0 201 41
the 0 201 41
alleged 0 201 41
incident 0 201 41
took 0 201 41
place, 0 201 41
yet 0 201 41
she 0 201 41
is 0 201 41
“one 0 201 41
hundred 0 201 41
percent” 0 201 41
certain 0 201 41
it 0 201 41
was 0 201 41
Kavanaugh 0 201 41
who 0 201 41
attacked 0 201 41
her. 0 201 41

At 0 201 42
the 0 201 42
outset 0 201 42
of 0 201 42
the 0 201 42
hearing, 0 201 42
Grassley 0 201 42
provided 0 201 42
an 0 201 42
overview 0 201 42
of 0 201 42
what 0 201 42
Kavanaugh 0 201 42
had 0 201 42
gone 0 201 42
through 0 201 42
–including 0 201 42
the 0 201 42
Democrats’ 0 201 42
sordid 0 201 42
behavior— 0 201 42
since 0 201 42
President 0 201 42
Trump 0 201 42
announced 0 201 42
the 0 201 42
judge’s 0 201 42
nomination 0 201 42
on 0 201 42
July 0 201 42
9. 0 201 42

As 0 201 43
part 0 201 43
of 0 201 43
the 0 201 43
confirmation 0 201 43
process, 0 201 43
Kavanaugh 0 201 43
endured 0 201 43
his 0 201 43
sixth 0 201 43
background 0 201 43
investigation 0 201 43
since 0 201 43
1993. 0 201 43

“Nowhere 0 201 44
in 0 201 44
any 0 201 44
of 0 201 44
these 0 201 44
six 0 201 44
FBI 0 201 44
reports, 0 201 44
which 0 201 44
committee 0 201 44
investigators 0 201 44
have 0 201 44
reviewed 0 201 44
on 0 201 44
a 0 201 44
bipartisan 0 201 44
basis, 0 201 44
was 0 201 44
there 0 201 44
a 0 201 44
whiff 0 201 44
of 0 201 44
any 0 201 44
issue 0 201 44
– 0 201 44
any 1 201 44
issue 1 201 44
at 0 201 44
all 0 201 44
related 0 201 44
in 0 201 44
any 0 201 44
way 0 201 44
to 0 201 44
inappropriate 0 201 44
sexual 0 201 44
behavior,” 0 201 44
Grassley 0 201 44
said. 0 201 44

Ford 0 201 45
shared 0 201 45
her 0 201 45
allegations 0 201 45
in 0 201 45
a 0 201 45
letter 0 201 45
to 0 201 45
the 0 201 45
committee’s 0 201 45
ranking 0 201 45
member, 0 201 45
Dianne 0 201 45
Feinstein 0 201 45
(D-Calif.), 0 201 45
in 0 201 45
the 0 201 45
summer. 0 201 45

The 0 201 46
letter 0 201 46
remained 0 201 46
secret 0 201 46
from 0 201 46
July 0 201 46
30 0 201 46
through 0 201 46
until 0 201 46
September 0 201 46
13 0 201 46
when 0 201 46
he 0 201 46
first 0 201 46
learned 0 201 46
about 0 201 46
it, 0 201 46
the 0 201 46
chairman 0 201 46
said. 0 201 46

Instead 0 201 47
of 0 201 47
sharing 0 201 47
the 0 201 47
letter 0 201 47
with 0 201 47
the 0 201 47
committee, 0 201 47
Feinstein 0 201 47
did 0 201 47
nothing. 0 201 47

Before 0 201 48
the 0 201 48
hearing, 0 201 48
Kavanaugh 0 201 48
met 0 201 48

who 0 201 48
didn’t 0 201 48
ask 0 201 48
him 0 201 48
about 0 201 48
the 0 201 48

The 0 201 49
committee 0 201 49
held 0 201 49
a 0 201 49
four-day 0 201 49
public 0 201 49
hearing 0 201 49
from 0 201 49
September 0 201 49
4 0 201 49
to 0 201 49
September 0 201 49
7 0 201 49
during 0 201 49
which 0 201 49
Kavanaugh 0 201 49
testified 0 201 49
for 0 201 49
more 0 201 49
than 0 201 49
32 0 201 49
hours 0 201 49
in 0 201 49
public. 0 201 49

Feinstein 0 201 50
didn’t 0 201 50
attend 0 201 50
it, 0 201 50
Grassley 0 201 50
said. 0 201 50

Kavanaugh 0 201 51
answered 0 201 51
almost 0 201 51
1,300 0 201 51
written 0 201 51
questions 0 201 51
senators 0 201 51
submitted 0 201 51
after 0 201 51
the 0 201 51
hearing. 0 201 51

That 0 201 52
is 0 201 52
“more 0 201 52
than 0 201 52
all 0 201 52
prior 0 201 52
Supreme 0 201 52
Court 0 201 52
nominees,” 0 201 52
he 0 201 52
said. 0 201 52

“Throughout 0 201 53
this 0 201 53
period, 0 201 53
we 0 201 53
did 0 201 53
not 0 201 53
know 0 201 53
about 0 201 53
the 0 201 53
ranking 0 201 53
member's 0 201 53
secret 0 201 53
evidence. 0 201 53

Then, 0 201 54
only 0 201 54
at 0 201 54
an 0 201 54
11th 0 201 54
hour, 0 201 54
on 0 201 54
the 0 201 54
eve 0 201 54
of 0 201 54
Judge 0 201 54
Kavanaugh's 0 201 54
confirmation 0 201 54

the 0 201 54
allegations 0 201 54
to 0 201 54
the 0 201 54
FBI. 0 201 54

And 0 201 55
then, 0 201 55
sadly, 0 201 55
the 0 201 55
allegations 0 201 55
were 0 201 55
leaked 0 201 55
to 0 201 55
the 0 201 55
press.” 0 201 55

“Every 0 201 56

After 0 201 57
Ford’s 0 201 57

Grassley’s 0 201 57

Kavanaugh 0 201 58
“immediately 0 201 58

“Democratic 0 201 60

That's 0 207 8
even 0 207 8
after 0 207 8
India's 0 207 8
Chandrayaan-2 0 207 8
mission 0 207 8
was 0 207 8
delayed 0 207 8
by 0 207 8
three 0 207 8
years 0 207 8
after 0 207 8
Russia 0 207 8
backed 0 207 8
out 0 207 8
of 0 207 8
designing 0 207 8
and 0 207 8
producing 0 207 8
the 0 207 8
mission's 0 207 8

Rather 0 207 9
than 0 207 9
lose 0 207 9
out 0 207 9
on 0 207 9
that 0 207 9
part 0 207 9
of 0 207 9
the 0 207 9

the 0 207 9
Indian 0 207 9

Organization 0 207 9
decided 0 207 9
to 0 207 9
just 0 207 9
do 0 207 9
it 0 207 9
themselves. 0 207 9

But 0 207 10
they 0 207 10
aren't 0 207 10
sure 0 207 10
how 0 207 10
long 0 207 10
they 0 207 10
can 0 207 10
expect 0 207 10
the 0 207 10
mission 0 207 10
to 0 207 10
last 0 207 10
once 0 207 10
the 0 207 10
lander 0 207 10
and 0 207 10
rover 0 207 10
arrive—it 0 207 10
could 0 207 10
be 0 207 10
over 0 207 10
in 0 207 10
as 0 207 10
little 0 207 10
as 0 207 10
two 0 207 10
weeks, 0 207 10
ending 0 207 10
as 0 207 10
soon 0 207 10
as 0 207 10
the 0 207 10
sun 0 207 10
sets, 0 207 10
since 0 207 10
the 0 207 10

The 0 207 14
new 0 207 14
mission's 0 207 14
predecessor, 0 207 14
Chandrayaan-1, 0 207 14
was 0 207 14
an 0 207 14
orbiter 0 207 14
that 0 207 14
found 0 207 14
the 0 207 14
first 0 207 14
evidence 0 207 14
that 0 207 14
there 0 207 14
was 0 207 14
water 0 207 14
ice 0 207 14
on 0 207 14
the 0 207 14
moon. 0 207 14

Now, 0 207 15
scientists 0 207 15
know 0 207 15
that 0 207 15
ice 0 207 15
is 0 207 15
likely 0 207 15
concentrated 0 207 15
at 0 207 15
the 0 207 15
poles, 0 207 15
where 0 207 15
it 0 207 15
could 0 207 15
become 0 207 15
an 0 207 15
important 0 207 15
resource 0 207 15
for 0 207 15
human 0 207 15

Nomination 0 209 0
Is 0 209 0
Exploding 1 209 0
in 1 209 0
Trump’s 1 209 0
Face 1 209 0

The 0 209 1
president 0 209 1
is 0 209 1
doubling 0 209 1
down 0 209 1
on 0 209 1
an 0 209 1
increasingly 0 209 1
risky 0 209 1
candidate. 0 209 1

Justice 0 209 2
Anthony 0 209 2
Kennedy 0 209 2
gave 0 209 2
President 0 209 2
Donald 0 209 2
Trump 0 209 2
the 1 209 2
biggest 1 209 2
political 1 209 2
gift 1 209 2
possible 1 209 2
when 0 209 2
he 0 209 2
announced 0 209 2
his 0 209 2
resignation 0 209 2
in 0 209 2
the 0 209 2
spring. 0 209 2

Even 0 209 3
though 0 209 3
not 0 209 3
everything 0 209 3
that’s 0 209 3
gone 0 209 3
wrong 0 209 3
is 0 209 3
Trump’s 0 209 3
fault, 0 209 3
he 0 209 3
has 0 209 3
managed 0 209 3
to 0 209 3
make 0 209 3
a 0 209 3
complete 1 209 3
hash 1 209 3
of 0 209 3
Brett 0 209 3
Kavanaugh’s 0 209 3
nomination 0 209 3
to 0 209 3
fill 0 209 3
the 0 209 3
empty 0 209 3
seat 0 209 3
on 0 209 3
the 0 209 3
court. 0 209 3

It’s 0 209 4
a 0 209 4
good 0 209 4
example 0 209 4
of 0 209 4
how 1 209 4
badly 1 209 4
Trump 1 209 4
does 1 209 4
his 1 209 4
job 1 209 4
more 0 209 4
than 0 209 4
a 0 209 4
year 0 209 4
and 0 209 4
a 0 209 4
half 0 209 4
into 0 209 4
his 0 209 4
administration. 0 209 4

To 0 209 5
begin 0 209 5
with, 0 209 5
Trump 0 209 5
has 0 209 5
outsourced 0 209 5
his 0 209 5
judicial 0 209 5
nominations 0 209 5
to 0 209 5
outside, 0 209 5
party-aligned 0 209 5
groups, 0 209 5
the 0 209 5
Heritage 0 209 5
Foundation 0 209 5
and 0 209 5
the 0 209 5
Federalist 0 209 5
Society. 0 209 5

That 0 209 6
included 0 209 6
an 0 209 6
unusually 0 209 6
central 0 209 6
role 0 209 6
for 0 209 6
the 0 209 6
Federalist 0 209 6
Society’s 0 209 6
Leonard 0 209 6
Leo. 0 209 6

That 0 209 7
wasn’t 0 209 7
entirely 0 209 7
a 0 209 7
Trump 0 209 7
mistake. 0 209 7

His 0 209 8
decision 0 209 8
during 0 209 8
the 0 209 8
campaign 0 209 8
to 0 209 8
release 0 209 8
a 0 209 8
list 0 209 8
of 0 209 8
potential 0 209 8
justices 0 209 8
drafted 0 209 8
by 0 209 8
Leo 0 209 8
reflected 1 209 8
the 1 209 8
reality-TV 1 209 8
star’s 1 209 8
weakness 1 209 8
as 1 209 8
a 1 209 8
presidential 1 209 8
candidate. 1 209 8

The 0 209 9
party 0 209 9
was 0 209 9
worried 0 209 9
that 0 209 9
Trump 0 209 9
might 0 209 9
turn 0 209 9
out 0 209 9
not 0 209 9
to 0 209 9
be 0 209 9
a 0 209 9
conservative; 0 209 9
to 0 209 9
reassure 0 209 9
them, 0 209 9
he 0 209 9
publicly 0 209 9
committed 0 209 9
to 0 209 9
their 0 209 9
top 0 209 9
goal. 0 209 9

In 0 209 10
some 0 209 10
ways, 0 209 10
that’s 0 209 10
successful 0 209 10
coalition-building, 0 209 10
and 0 209 10
what 0 209 10
he’s 0 209 10
done 0 209 10
in 0 209 10
office 0 209 10
is 0 209 10
just 0 209 10
keeping 0 209 10
his 0 209 10
promises 0 209 10
on 0 209 10
judges. 0 209 10

Still, 0 209 11
it’s 0 209 11
one 0 209 11
thing 0 209 11
to 0 209 11
form 0 209 11
an 0 209 11
alliance 0 209 11
with 0 209 11
conservatives; 0 209 11
it’s 0 209 11
another 0 209 11
to 0 209 11
turn 0 209 11
the 0 209 11
whole 0 209 11
process 0 209 11
over 0 209 11
to 0 209 11
them. 0 209 11

We 0 209 12
don’t 0 209 12
know 0 209 12
to 0 209 12
what 0 209 12
extent 0 209 12
Kavanaugh 0 209 12
was 0 209 12
Trump’s 0 209 12
choice 0 209 12
and 0 209 12
to 0 209 12
what 0 209 12
extent 0 209 12
he 0 209 12
was 0 209 12
manipulated 0 209 12
into 0 209 12
choosing 0 209 12
him. 0 209 12

We 0 209 13
have 0 209 13
plenty 0 209 13
of 0 209 13
evidence 0 209 13
that 0 209 13
Trump 1 209 13
is 1 209 13
easily 1 209 13
manipulated 1 209 13
by 1 209 13
those 1 209 13
around 1 209 13
him, 1 209 13
and 0 209 13
that 0 209 13
Kavanaugh 0 209 13
is 0 209 13
a 0 209 13
good 0 209 13
fit 0 209 13
for 0 209 13
Trump’s 0 209 13
biases: 0 209 13
The 0 209 13
judge 0 209 13
has 0 209 13
Ivy 0 209 13
League 0 209 13
credentials 0 209 13
and 0 209 13
he 0 209 13
passes 0 209 13
Trump’s 0 209 13
cut-of-his-jib 1 209 13
test 1 209 13
by 0 209 13
looking 0 209 13
the 0 209 13
part. 0 209 13

1 0 209 14

Either 0 209 15
way, 0 209 15
Kavanaugh 0 209 15
was 0 209 15
a 0 209 15
poor 0 209 15
choice 0 209 15
from 0 209 15
the 0 209 15
point 0 209 15
of 0 209 15
view 0 209 15
of 0 209 15
good 0 209 15
presidenting. 0 209 15

The 0 209 16
judge 0 209 16
was 0 209 16
certain 0 209 16
to 0 209 16
be 0 209 16
a 0 209 16
highly 0 209 16
controversial 0 209 16
selection 0 209 16
from 0 209 16
the 0 209 16
start. 0 209 16

After 0 209 17
all, 0 209 17
he 0 209 17
had 0 209 17
been 0 209 17
a 0 209 17
highly 0 209 17
controversial 0 209 17
selection 0 209 17
for 0 209 17
his 0 209 17
current 0 209 17
circuit 0 209 17
court 0 209 17
seat, 0 209 17
eventually 0 209 17
getting 0 209 17
confirmed 0 209 17
with 0 209 17
only 0 209 17
four 0 209 17
Democratic 0 209 17
votes 0 209 17
after 0 209 17
a 0 209 17
long 0 209 17
delay. 0 209 17

Kavanaugh 0 209 18
is 0 209 18
a 0 209 18
longtime 0 209 18
Republican 0 209 18
operative, 0 209 18
a 0 209 18
hard-liner 0 209 18
during 0 209 18
both 0 209 18
the 0 209 18
Vince 0 209 18
Foster 0 209 18
and 0 209 18
Monica 0 209 18
Lewinsky 0 209 18
investigations. 0 209 18

Nominating 0 209 19
him, 0 209 19
rather 0 209 19
than 0 209 19
a 0 209 19
conservative 0 209 19
with 0 209 19
similar 0 209 19
views 0 209 19
but 0 209 19
a 0 209 19
different 0 209 19
background, 0 209 19
was 0 209 19
bound 0 209 19
to 0 209 19
stir 0 209 19
up 0 209 19
trouble. 0 209 19

It 0 209 20
was 0 209 20
also 0 209 20
true, 0 209 20
as 0 209 20
Senate 0 209 20
Majority 0 209 20
Leader 0 209 20
Mitch 0 209 20
McConnell 0 209 20
reportedly 0 209 20
warned, 0 209 20
that 0 209 20
normal 0 209 20
disclosure 0 209 20
of 0 209 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 209 20
record, 0 209 20
especially 0 209 20
his 0 209 20
service 0 209 20
during 0 209 20
the 0 209 20
George 0 209 20
W. 0 209 20
Bush 0 209 20
administration, 0 209 20
was 0 209 20
going 0 209 20
to 0 209 20
delay 0 209 20
confirmation 0 209 20
even 0 209 20
more. 0 209 20

Senate 0 209 21
Republicans 0 209 21
dealt 0 209 21
with 0 209 21
that 0 209 21
problem 0 209 21
by 0 209 21
deciding 0 209 21
to 0 209 21
not 0 209 21
bother 0 209 21
with 0 209 21
any 0 209 21
Kavanaugh 0 209 21
documents 0 209 21
that 0 209 21
couldn’t 0 209 21
be 0 209 21
produced 0 209 21
rapidly, 0 209 21
which 0 209 21
further 0 209 21
riled 0 209 21
up 0 209 21
the 0 209 21
Democrats 0 209 21
and 0 209 21
gave 0 209 21
that 0 209 21
party 0 209 21
some 0 209 21
good 0 209 21
talking 0 209 21
points. 0 209 21

2 0 209 22

Sometimes 0 209 23
it’s 0 209 23
worth 0 209 23
taking 0 209 23
risks. 0 209 23

Presidents 0 209 24
who 0 209 24
shy 0 209 24
away 0 209 24
from 0 209 24
anything 0 209 24
that’s 0 209 24
not 0 209 24
a 0 209 24
sure 0 209 24
thing 0 209 24
can 0 209 24
fail 0 209 24
to 0 209 24
exploit 0 209 24
opportunities. 0 209 24

It’s 0 209 25
just 0 209 25
very 0 209 25
hard 0 209 25
to 0 209 25
see 0 209 25
any 0 209 25
upside 0 209 25
for 0 209 25
Trump 0 209 25
in 0 209 25
choosing 0 209 25
Kavanaugh 0 209 25
instead 0 209 25
of 0 209 25
a 0 209 25
safer, 0 209 25
but 0 209 25
still 0 209 25
very 0 209 25
conservative, 0 209 25
other 0 209 25
option. 0 209 25

3 0 209 26

When 0 209 27
serious 0 209 27
charges 0 209 27
of 0 209 27
sexual 0 209 27
misconduct 0 209 27
were 0 209 27
raised 0 209 27
against 0 209 27
Kavanaugh, 0 209 27
Trump 0 209 27
decided 0 209 27
to 0 209 27
stick 0 209 27
with 0 209 27
him 0 209 27
instead 0 209 27
of 0 209 27
moving 0 209 27
on 0 209 27
to 0 209 27
another 0 209 27
candidate. 0 209 27

It’s 0 209 28
still 0 209 28
not 0 209 28
clear 0 209 28
that 0 209 28
Kavanaugh’s 0 209 28
nomination 0 209 28
is 0 209 28
doomed, 0 209 28
but 0 209 28
it’s 0 209 28
certainly 0 209 28
in 0 209 28
severe 1 209 28
trouble. 1 209 28

Losing 0 209 29
a 0 209 29
high-profile 0 209 29
fight 0 209 29
is 0 209 29
always 0 209 29
going 0 209 29
to 0 209 29
hurt 0 209 29
a 0 209 29
president, 0 209 29
which 0 209 29
is 0 209 29
why 0 209 29
they 0 209 29
should 0 209 29
take 0 209 29
care 0 209 29
to 0 209 29
avoid 0 209 29
high-risk, 0 209 29
low-reward 0 209 29
conflicts. 0 209 29

But 0 209 30
there’s 0 209 30
an 0 209 30
art 0 209 30
to 0 209 30
minimizing 0 209 30
damage. 0 209 30

And 0 209 31
Trump 1 209 31
hasn’t 1 209 31
learned 1 209 31
it 1 209 31
yet. 1 209 31

For 0 209 32
one 0 209 32
thing, 0 209 32
the 0 209 32
president 0 209 32
has 0 209 32
made 0 209 32
this 0 209 32
an 0 209 32
extremely 1 209 32
high-profile 1 209 32
episode 1 209 32
by 0 209 32
stringing 0 209 32
out 0 209 32
the 0 209 32
process 0 209 32
as 0 209 32
the 0 209 32
accusations 0 209 32
against 0 209 32
Kavanaugh 0 209 32
gained 0 209 32
credibility 0 209 32
and 0 209 32
even 0 209 32
multiplied. 0 209 32

Whether 0 209 33
that 0 209 33
matters 0 209 33
in 0 209 33
terms 0 209 33
of 0 209 33
public 0 209 33
opinion 0 209 33
for 0 209 33
Trump 0 209 33
is 0 209 33
unclear, 0 209 33
but 0 209 33
it 0 209 33
certainly 0 209 33
isn’t 0 209 33
good 0 209 33
for 0 209 33
any 0 209 33
Republican 0 209 33
senators 0 209 33
caught 0 209 33
up 0 209 33
in 0 209 33
the 0 209 33
middle, 0 209 33
along 0 209 33
with 0 209 33
any 0 209 33
other 0 209 33
candidates 0 209 33
who 0 209 33
have 0 209 33
had 0 209 33
to 0 209 33
weigh 0 209 33
in 0 209 33
only 0 209 33
to 0 209 33
find 0 209 33
the 0 209 33
facts 0 209 33
as 0 209 33
they 0 209 33
knew 0 209 33
them 0 209 33
constantly 0 209 33
changing. 0 209 33

It’s 0 209 34
also 0 209 34
the 0 209 34
case 0 209 34
that 0 209 34
the 0 209 34
more 0 209 34
negative 0 209 34
information 0 209 34
comes 0 209 34
out, 0 209 34
the 0 209 34
more 0 209 34
it 0 209 34
appears 0 209 34
that 0 209 34
the 0 209 34
Trump 1 209 34
and 1 209 34
his 1 209 34
White 1 209 34
House 1 209 34
staff 1 209 34
failed 1 209 34
to 1 209 34
do 1 209 34
their 1 209 34
jobs 1 209 34
in 0 209 34
vetting 0 209 34
and 0 209 34
managing 0 209 34
Kavanaugh. 0 209 34

If 0 209 35
the 0 209 35
nomination 0 209 35
had 0 209 35
been 0 209 35
pulled 0 209 35
right 0 209 35
after 0 209 35
Christine 0 209 35
Blasey 0 209 35
Ford 0 209 35
made 0 209 35
her 0 209 35
initial 0 209 35
assertions 0 209 35
about 0 209 35
Kavanaugh, 0 209 35
the 0 209 35
public 0 209 35
might 0 209 35
have 0 209 35
concluded 0 209 35
that 0 209 35
it 0 209 35
wasn’t 0 209 35
Trump’s 0 209 35
fault 0 209 35
that 0 209 35
a 0 209 35
previously 0 209 35
unaired 0 209 35
accusation 0 209 35
came 0 209 35
to 0 209 35
light. 0 209 35

Meanwhile, 0 209 36
Trump’s 0 209 36
behavior 0 209 36
has 0 209 36
been 0 209 36
as 0 209 36
erratic 0 209 36
as 0 209 36
ever. 0 209 36

First 0 209 37
he 0 209 37
said 0 209 37
that 0 209 37
Brasey 0 209 37
had 0 209 37
to 0 209 37
be 0 209 37
heard; 0 209 37
then 0 209 37
he 0 209 37
attacked 0 209 37
her 0 209 37
in 0 209 37
terms 0 209 37
that 0 209 37
were 0 209 37
a 1 209 37
slur 1 209 37
on 1 209 37
all 1 209 37
women 1 209 37
who 0 209 37
have 0 209 37
been 0 209 37
assaulted 0 209 37
without 0 209 37
immediately 0 209 37
reporting 0 209 37
it 0 209 37
to 0 209 37
the 0 209 37
police, 0 209 37
and 0 209 37
he 0 209 37
also 0 209 37
blamed 0 209 37
the 0 209 37
Senate 0 209 37
for 0 209 37
not 0 209 37
voting 0 209 37
before 0 209 37
she 0 209 37
came 0 209 37
forward. 0 209 37

He 0 209 38
sometimes 0 209 38
praises 0 209 38
Kavanaugh, 0 209 38
but 0 209 38
also 0 209 38
let 0 209 38
it 0 209 38
be 0 209 38
known 0 209 38
that 0 209 38
he 0 209 38
thought 0 209 38
the 0 209 38
nominee 0 209 38
had 0 209 38
performed 0 209 38
badly 0 209 38
in 0 209 38
his 0 209 38
Fox 0 209 38
News 0 209 38
interview. 0 209 38

The 0 209 39
White 0 209 39
House 0 209 39
demanded 0 209 39
a 0 209 39
final 0 209 39
up 0 209 39
and 0 209 39
down 0 209 39
vote 0 209 39
on 0 209 39
Tuesday; 0 209 39
by 0 209 39
Wednesday, 0 209 39
he 0 209 39
was 0 209 39
saying 0 209 39
that 0 209 39
the 0 209 39
nomination 0 209 39
would 0 209 39
die 0 209 39
if 0 209 39
Kavanaugh 0 209 39
didn’t 0 209 39
do 0 209 39
well 0 209 39
before 0 209 39
the 0 209 39
Judiciary 0 209 39
Committee 0 209 39
on 0 209 39
Thursday. 0 209 39

The 0 209 40
sum 0 209 40
of 0 209 40
all 0 209 40
this 0 209 40
has 0 209 40
been, 0 209 40
as 0 209 40
in 0 209 40
many 0 209 40
other 0 209 40
episodes, 0 209 40
that 0 209 40
Trump 0 209 40
and 0 209 40
his 0 209 40
White 0 209 40
House 0 209 40
are 0 209 40
a 1 209 40
gang 1 209 40
that 1 209 40
can’t 1 209 40
shoot 1 209 40
straight 1 209 40
and 0 209 40
that 0 209 40
he’s 0 209 40
eager 0 209 40
to 0 209 40
blame 0 209 40
his 0 209 40
allies 0 209 40
and 0 209 40
lash 0 209 40
out 0 209 40
at 0 209 40
his 0 209 40
enemies 0 209 40
in 0 209 40
ugly 1 209 40
ways 1 209 40
when 0 209 40
things 0 209 40
go 0 209 40
wrong. 0 209 40

A 0 209 41
botched 0 209 41
nomination 0 209 41
matters 0 209 41
because 0 209 41
allies 0 209 41
will 0 209 41
be 0 209 41
less 0 209 41
likely 0 209 41
to 0 209 41
trust 0 209 41
Trump, 0 209 41
not 0 209 41
just 0 209 41
on 0 209 41
Supreme 0 209 41
Court 0 209 41
choices, 0 209 41
but 0 209 41
on 0 209 41
any 0 209 41
initiative. 0 209 41

And, 0 209 42
for 0 209 42
that 0 209 42
matter, 0 209 42
they’ll 0 209 42
be 0 209 42
less 0 209 42
likely 0 209 42
to 0 209 42
trust 0 209 42
him 0 209 42
when 0 209 42
he 0 209 42
asserts 0 209 42
that 0 209 42
there’s 0 209 42
nothing 0 209 42
remaining 0 209 42
for 0 209 42
Special 0 209 42
Counsel 0 209 42
Robert 0 209 42
Mueller 0 209 42
to 0 209 42
reveal. 0 209 42

Trump’s 0 209 43
professional 0 209 43
reputation 0 209 43
is 0 209 43
already 0 209 43
terrible, 0 209 43
but 0 209 43
everything 0 209 43
counts. 0 209 43

As 1 209 44
the 1 209 44
political 1 209 44
scientist 1 209 44
Richard 1 209 44
Neustadt 1 209 44
said, 1 209 44
political 1 209 44
elites 1 209 44
are 1 209 44
constantly 1 209 44
evaluating 1 209 44
and 1 209 44
re-evaluating 1 209 44
the 1 209 44
president. 1 209 44

Trump 0 209 45
is 0 209 45
hurting 0 209 45
himself 0 209 45
right 0 209 45
now, 0 209 45
and 0 209 45
will 0 209 45
have 0 209 45
hurt 0 209 45
himself 0 209 45
more 0 209 45
if 0 209 45
Kavanaugh 0 209 45
is 0 209 45
not 0 209 45
confirmed. 0 209 45

And 0 209 46
yes, 0 209 46
I 0 209 46
call 0 209 46
it 0 209 46
the 0 209 46
cut-of-his-jib 1 209 46
test 1 209 46
quite 0 209 46
deliberately. 0 209 46

It's 0 209 47
no 0 209 47
surprise 0 209 47
that 0 209 47
someone 1 209 47
who 1 209 47
hires 1 209 47
based 1 209 47
on 1 209 47
what 1 209 47
he 1 209 47
thinks 1 209 47
someone 1 209 47
doing 1 209 47
that 1 209 47
job 1 209 47
should 1 209 47
look 1 209 47
like, 1 209 47
which 0 209 47
seems 0 209 47
to 0 209 47
be 0 209 47
based 0 209 47
on 0 209 47
hazy 1 209 47
old-time 1 209 47
Hollywood 1 209 47
casting, 1 209 47
would 0 209 47
wind 0 209 47
up 0 209 47
with 0 209 47
fewer 0 209 47
women 0 209 47
in 0 209 47
his 0 209 47
administration 0 209 47
than 0 209 47
any 0 209 47
of 0 209 47
his 0 209 47
recent 0 209 47
predecessors. 0 209 47

I've 0 209 48
argued 0 209 48
that 0 209 48
too 0 209 48
much 0 209 48
disclosure 0 209 48
is 0 209 48
required, 0 209 48
and 0 209 48
that 0 209 48
Democrats 0 209 48
(and 0 209 48
any 0 209 48
wavering 0 209 48
Republicans) 0 209 48
had 0 209 48
more 0 209 48
than 0 209 48
enough 0 209 48
information 0 209 48
to 0 209 48
make 0 209 48
up 0 209 48
their 0 209 48
mind. 0 209 48

I 0 209 49
still 0 209 49
think 0 209 49
that's 0 209 49
true. 0 209 49

But 0 209 50
it 0 209 50
did 0 209 50
leave 0 209 50
Republicans 0 209 50
vulnerable 0 209 50
to 0 209 50
claims 0 209 50
about 0 209 50
transparency 0 209 50
which 0 209 50
were 0 209 50
likely 0 209 50
to 0 209 50
be 0 209 50
popular 0 209 50
-- 0 209 50
most 0 209 50
people, 0 209 50
and 0 209 50
the 0 209 50
entire 0 209 50
press 0 209 50
corps, 0 209 50
love 0 209 50
transparency 0 209 50
-- 0 209 50
and 0 209 50
vulnerable 0 209 50
to 0 209 50
bombshells 1 209 50
in 0 209 50
the 0 209 50
documentary 0 209 50
record 0 209 50
which 0 209 50
hadn't 0 209 50
been 0 209 50
initially 0 209 50
disclosed. 0 209 50

In 0 209 51
the 0 209 51
event, 0 209 51
that's 0 209 51
not 0 209 51
what's 0 209 51
causing 0 209 51
the 0 209 51
trouble, 0 209 51
but 0 209 51
still 0 209 51
it's 0 209 51
an 0 209 51
example 0 209 51
of 0 209 51
Trump 0 209 51
taking 0 209 51
needless 0 209 51
risks. 0 209 51

Some 0 209 52
have 0 209 52
speculated 0 209 52
that 0 209 52
Kavanaugh 0 209 52
would 0 209 52
be 0 209 52
especially 0 209 52
likely 0 209 52
to 0 209 52
rule 0 209 52
in 0 209 52
Trump's 0 209 52
favor 0 209 52
if 0 209 52
any 0 209 52
cases 0 209 52
stemming 0 209 52
from 0 209 52
the 0 209 52
Robert 0 209 52
Mueller 0 209 52
investigation 0 209 52
wind 0 209 52
up 0 209 52
at 0 209 52
the 0 209 52
high 0 209 52
court. 0 209 52

Perhaps. 0 209 53

There 0 209 54
are 0 209 54
plenty 0 209 54
of 0 209 54
other 0 209 54
partisan, 1 209 54
conservative 1 209 54
judges, 1 209 54
and 0 209 54
plenty 0 209 54
of 0 209 54
conservative 0 209 54
judges 0 209 54
who 0 209 54
lean 0 209 54
towards 0 209 54
an 0 209 54
expansive 0 209 54
view 0 209 54
of 0 209 54
presidential 0 209 54
powers. 0 209 54

And 0 209 55
if 0 209 55
Kavanaugh 0 209 55
is 0 209 55
really 0 209 55
an 0 209 55
outlier 0 209 55
on 0 209 55
that 0 209 55
issue, 0 209 55
then 0 209 55
he 0 209 55
won't 0 209 55
be 0 209 55
in 0 209 55
the 0 209 55
majority 0 209 55
on 0 209 55
any 0 209 55
future 0 209 55
decision 0 209 55
anyway. 0 209 55

So, 0 209 56
no, 0 209 56
I 0 209 56
don't 0 209 56
think 0 209 56
there's 0 209 56
any 0 209 56
good 0 209 56
reason 0 209 56
to 0 209 56
think 0 209 56
Kavanaugh 0 209 56
would 0 209 56
be 0 209 56
especially 0 209 56
helpful 0 209 56

the 0 210 14

that? 0 210 40

IG 0 210 41

can’t 0 210 41
prove 0 210 41
it, 0 210 41
but 0 210 41
he’s 0 210 41
not 0 210 41
sure 0 210 41
that 0 210 41

How 1 210 42
in 1 210 42

can 1 210 42
we 1 210 42

We 0 210 43
see 0 210 43
this 0 210 43

of 0 210 43
corruption 0 210 43
all 0 210 43
over 0 210 43
the 0 210 43

why 0 210 43
should 0 210 43
believe 0 210 43
that 0 210 43
these 0 210 43

the 0 210 44

and 0 210 44
they 0 210 44
were 0 210 44
comfortable 0 210 44
enough 0 210 44
with 0 210 44
each 0 210 44
other 0 210 44

those 0 210 44
biases! 0 210 44

Not 0 210 45
only 0 210 45
that, 0 210 45
the 0 210 45
team 0 210 45
that 0 210 45
handled 0 210 45
Clinton’s 0 210 45

so 0 210 45
poorly 0 210 45
was 0 210 45
almost 0 210 45
the 0 210 45

the 0 210 45
Russia 0 210 45

Meaning, 0 210 46
the 0 210 46
obviously 0 210 46
politically 0 210 46
biased 0 210 46

cleared 0 210 46

the 0 210 46
man 0 210 46
that 0 210 46

Strzok 0 210 61
writes 0 210 61
that 0 210 61
the 0 210 61

has 0 210 61
been 0 210 61
focused 0 210 61
on 0 210 61
the 0 210 61
question 0 210 61
of 0 210 61
why 0 210 61
Hillary 0 210 61
seems 0 210 61
to 0 210 61
be 0 210 61
getting 0 210 61
a 0 210 61

when 0 210 61
“Petraeus/Berger/Libby” 0 210 61

not. 0 210 61

He 0 210 62

“We 0 210 62
draw 0 210 62
the 0 210 62

i.e. 0 210 62

notwithstanding 0 210 63
the 0 210 63

we 0 210 63

Hillary 0 210 63
may 0 210 63
have 0 210 63
been 0 210 63
hacked 0 210 63

she 0 210 63
didn’t 0 210 63
intentionally 0 210 63
give 0 210 63
anything 0 210 63
away. 0 210 63

Of 0 210 64
course, 0 210 64
the 0 210 64
statute 0 210 64
itself 0 210 64
didn’t 0 210 64
make 0 210 64
intent 0 210 64
a 0 210 64

once 0 210 65

this 0 210 65
same 0 210 65

“Officials 0 210 65
from 0 210 65

‘intent’ 0 210 65
for 0 210 65
charges 0 210 65
to 0 210 65
be 0 210 65
filed,” 0 210 65
the 0 210 65
memo 0 210 65
says, 0 210 65
before 0 210 65
pointing 0 210 65
to 0 210 65
statements 0 210 65
by 0 210 65
Comey 0 210 65
that 0 210 65
indicated 0 210 65
a 0 210 65

that 0 210 65
intent 0 210 65
was 0 210 65
required 0 210 65
— 0 210 65
which 0 210 65
the 0 210 65
memo 0 210 65
says 0 210 65
ignored 0 210 65
“meaningful 0 210 65
aspects” 0 210 65
of 0 210 65
the 0 210 65
law. 0 210 65

It 0 210 66
really 0 210 66
does 0 210 66
seem 0 210 66
that 0 210 66
Strzok, 0 210 66
an 0 210 66
agent 0 210 66
who 0 210 66
had 0 210 66
a 0 210 66
personal 0 210 66
pro-Hillary 0 210 66
bias, 0 210 66
was 0 210 66
the 0 210 66
person 0 210 66
who 0 210 66
pushed 0 210 66
to 0 210 66
let 0 210 66
her 0 210 66
off 0 210 66
the 0 210 66
hook 0 210 66
by 0 210 66
focusing 0 210 66
on 0 210 66
her 0 210 66
intent 0 210 66
rather 0 210 66
than 0 210 66
her 0 210 66
negligence 0 210 66
setting 0 210 66
up 0 210 66
the 0 210 66
server 0 210 66
in 0 210 66
the 0 210 66
first 0 210 66
place. 0 210 66

I 1 210 67
fully 1 210 67
believe 1 210 67
IG 1 210 67
Horowitz’ 1 210 67
findings 1 210 67
here. 0 210 67

I 0 210 68
believe 0 210 68
that 0 210 68
he 0 210 68
was 0 210 68
unable 0 210 68
to 0 210 68
prove 0 210 68
that 0 210 68
there 0 210 68
was 0 210 68
any 0 210 68
political 0 210 68
motive 0 210 68
to 0 210 68
the 0 210 68
FBI’s 0 210 68
handling 0 210 68
of 0 210 68
the 0 210 68
Clinton 0 210 68
email 0 210 68
case, 0 210 68
and 0 210 68
I 0 210 68
believe 0 210 68
that 0 210 68
while 0 210 68
the 0 210 68
case 0 210 68
was 0 210 68
obviously 0 210 68
mishandled, 1 210 68
it 0 210 68
could 0 210 68
have 0 210 68
reached 0 210 68
the 0 210 68
conclusion 0 210 68
it 0 210 68
did 0 210 68
honorably. 0 210 68

However, 0 210 69
I 0 210 69
also 0 210 69
think 0 210 69
that 0 210 69
the 0 210 69
IG 0 210 69
has 0 210 69
purposely 0 210 69
left 0 210 69
room 0 210 69
in 0 210 69
his 0 210 69
conclusion 0 210 69
to 0 210 69
amend 0 210 69
that 0 210 69
decision 0 210 69
after 0 210 69
he’s 0 210 69
concluded 0 210 69
his 0 210 69
Russia 0 210 69
investigation. 0 210 69

In 0 210 70
fact, 0 210 70
there 0 210 70
are 0 210 70
already 0 210 70
signs 0 210 70
of 0 210 70
him 0 210 70
doing 0 210 70
that 0 210 70
in 0 210 70
this 0 210 70
report. 0 210 70

Much 0 210 71
of 0 210 71
the 0 210 71
information 0 210 71
that 0 210 71
he 0 210 71
uses 0 210 71
to 0 210 71
chastise 0 210 71
Strzok’s 0 210 71
behavior 0 210 71
and 0 210 71
judgment 0 210 71
in 0 210 71
the 0 210 71
Clinton 0 210 71
email 0 210 71
case, 0 210 71
would 0 210 71
have 0 210 71
actually 0 210 71
come 0 210 71
from 0 210 71
his 0 210 71
current 0 210 71
investigation 0 210 71
into 0 210 71
the 0 210 71
Russia 0 210 71
mess. 0 210 71

It’s 0 210 72
quite 0 210 72
possible 0 210 72
that 0 210 72
as 0 210 72
bad 0 210 72
as 0 210 72
this 0 210 72

conclusion 0 210 72
in 0 210 72
the 0 210 72

by 0 212 11

“With 1 212 12

we 1 212 12

realizing 1 212 12
the 1 212 12
magnitude 1 212 12

the 1 212 12
gravity 1 212 12
of 1 212 12

“Looking 0 212 14

being 0 212 15

up 0 212 15

survivor 0 212 16
who 0 212 16

the 0 212 16
main 0 212 16
survivors’ 0 212 16
group 0 212 16
in 0 212 16
Ireland, 0 212 16
commented 0 212 16
on 0 212 16
Twitter 0 212 16
that 0 212 16
the 0 212 16
pope 0 212 16

“Much 0 212 16

before.” 0 212 16

But 0 212 17
O’Gorman 0 212 17
added: 0 212 17
“(The 1 212 17
pope) 1 212 17
begs 1 212 17
for 1 212 17
forgiveness, 1 212 17

still 1 212 17
does 1 212 17
not 1 212 17
admit 1 212 17
or 1 212 17
own 1 212 17
the 1 212 17
deliberate 1 212 17
policy 1 212 17
of 1 212 17
cover 1 212 17
up 1 212 17
designed 1 212 17
& 1 212 17
implemented 1 212 17
by 1 212 17

Like 1 212 18
his 1 212 18
predecessor, 1 212 18
Francis 1 212 18
has 1 212 18
promised 1 212 18
“zero 1 212 18
tolerance” 1 212 18
on 1 212 18
child 1 212 18
abuse, 1 212 18
but 1 212 18
scandals 1 212 18
have 1 212 18
kept 1 212 18
recurring 1 212 18
in 1 212 18
several 1 212 18
parts 1 212 18
of 1 212 18
the 1 212 18
world 1 212 18
— 1 212 18
including 1 212 18
in 1 212 18
Australia 1 212 18
recently. 1 212 18

In 0 212 19
January, 0 212 19
the 0 212 19
pope 0 212 19
was 0 212 19
accused 0 212 19
of 0 212 19
insensitivity 0 212 19
and 0 212 19
tone-deafness 0 212 19
after 0 212 19
insisting, 0 212 19
during 0 212 19
a 0 212 19
visit 0 212 19
to 0 212 19
Chile, 0 212 19
that 0 212 19
local 0 212 19
abuse 0 212 19
survivors 0 212 19
had 0 212 19
no 0 212 19
“proof” 0 212 19
against 0 212 19
a 0 212 19
bishop 0 212 19
who 0 212 19
allegedly 0 212 19
witnessed 0 212 19
abuse 0 212 19
and 0 212 19
failed 0 212 19
to 0 212 19
report 0 212 19
it. 0 212 19

Following 0 212 20
an 0 212 20
outcry, 1 212 20
Francis 0 212 20
apologized 0 212 20
for 0 212 20
his 0 212 20
remarks, 0 212 20
held 0 212 20
private 0 212 20
meetings 0 212 20
with 0 212 20
victims 0 212 20
at 0 212 20
the 0 212 20
Vatican, 0 212 20
and, 0 212 20
after 0 212 20
envoys 0 212 20
he 0 212 20
sent 0 212 20
to 0 212 20
Chile 0 212 20
backed 0 212 20
up 0 212 20
victims’ 0 212 20
claims, 0 212 20

Here 0 215 21

Abraham’s 0 215 21
account… 0 215 21

“And 0 215 22
the 0 215 22
men 0 215 22
rose 0 215 22
up 0 215 22
from 0 215 22
thence, 0 215 22
and 0 215 22
looked 0 215 22
toward 0 215 22
Sodom: 0 215 22
and 0 215 22
Abraham 0 215 22
went 0 215 22
with 0 215 22
them 0 215 22
to 0 215 22
bring 0 215 22
them 0 215 22
on 0 215 22
the 0 215 22
way. 0 215 22

And 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
Lord 0 215 23
said, 0 215 23
Shall 0 215 23
I 0 215 23
hide 0 215 23
from 0 215 23
Abraham 0 215 23
that 0 215 23
thing 0 215 23
which 0 215 23
I 0 215 23
do; 0 215 23
Seeing 0 215 23
that 0 215 23
Abraham 0 215 23
shall 0 215 23
surely 0 215 23
become 0 215 23
a 0 215 23
great 0 215 23
and 0 215 23
mighty 0 215 23
nation, 0 215 23

all 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
nations 0 215 23
of 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
earth 0 215 23
shall 0 215 23
be 0 215 23
blessed 0 215 23

him? 0 215 23

For 0 215 24
I 0 215 24
know 0 215 24
him, 0 215 24
that 0 215 24
he 0 215 24
will 0 215 24
command 0 215 24
his 0 215 24
children 0 215 24

his 0 215 24
household 0 215 24
after 0 215 24
him, 0 215 24
and 0 215 24
they 0 215 24
shall 0 215 24
keep 0 215 24
the 0 215 24
way 0 215 24
of 0 215 24
the 0 215 24
Lord, 0 215 24
to 0 215 24
do 0 215 24
justice 0 215 24
and 0 215 24
judgment; 0 215 24
that 0 215 24
the 0 215 24
Lord 0 215 24
may 0 215 24
bring 0 215 24
upon 0 215 24
Abraham 0 215 24
that 0 215 24
which 0 215 24
he 0 215 24
hath 0 215 24
spoken 0 215 24
of 0 215 24
him. 0 215 24

And 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
Lord 0 215 25
said, 0 215 25
Because 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
cry 0 215 25
of 0 215 25
Sodom 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
Gomorrah 0 215 25
is 0 215 25
great, 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
because 0 215 25
their 0 215 25
sin 0 215 25
is 0 215 25
very 0 215 25
grievous; 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
will 0 215 25
go 0 215 25
down 0 215 25
now, 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
see 0 215 25
whether 0 215 25
they 0 215 25
have 0 215 25
done 0 215 25
altogether 0 215 25
according 0 215 25
to 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
cry 0 215 25
of 0 215 25
it, 0 215 25
which 0 215 25
is 0 215 25
come 0 215 25
unto 0 215 25
me; 0 215 25
and 0 215 25
if 0 215 25
not, 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
will 0 215 25
know. 0 215 25

And 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
men 0 215 26
turned 0 215 26
their 0 215 26
faces 0 215 26
from 0 215 26
thence, 0 215 26
and 0 215 26
went 0 215 26
toward 0 215 26
Sodom: 0 215 26
but 0 215 26
Abraham 0 215 26
stood 0 215 26
yet 0 215 26
before 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
Lord. 0 215 26

And 0 215 27
Abraham 0 215 27
drew 0 215 27
near, 0 215 27
and 0 215 27
said, 0 215 27
Wilt 0 215 27
thou 0 215 27
also 0 215 27
destroy 0 215 27
the 1 215 27
righteous 1 215 27
with 0 215 27
the 1 215 27
wicked? 1 215 27

Peradventure 0 215 28
there 0 215 28
be 0 215 28
fifty 0 215 28
righteous 1 215 28
within 0 215 28
the 0 215 28
city: 0 215 28
wilt 0 215 28
thou 0 215 28
also 0 215 28
destroy 0 215 28
and 0 215 28
not 0 215 28
spare 0 215 28
the 0 215 28
place 0 215 28
for 0 215 28
the 0 215 28
fifty 0 215 28
righteous 1 215 28
that 0 215 28
are 0 215 28
therein? 0 215 28

That 0 215 29
be 0 215 29
far 0 215 29
from 0 215 29
thee 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
do 0 215 29
after 0 215 29
this 0 215 29
manner, 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
slay 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
righteous 1 215 29
with 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
wicked: 1 215 29
and 0 215 29
that 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
righteous 1 215 29
should 0 215 29
be 0 215 29
as 0 215 29
the 1 215 29
wicked, 1 215 29
that 0 215 29
be 0 215 29
far 0 215 29
from 0 215 29
thee: 0 215 29
Shall 0 215 29
not 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
Judge 0 215 29
of 0 215 29
all 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
earth 0 215 29
do 0 215 29
right? 0 215 29

And 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
Lord 0 215 30
said, 0 215 30
If 0 215 30
I 0 215 30
find 0 215 30
in 0 215 30
Sodom 0 215 30
fifty 0 215 30
righteous 1 215 30
within 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
city, 0 215 30
then 0 215 30
I 0 215 30
will 0 215 30
spare 0 215 30
all 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
place 0 215 30
for 0 215 30
their 0 215 30
sakes. 0 215 30

And 0 215 31
Abraham 0 215 31
answered 0 215 31
and 0 215 31
said, 0 215 31
Behold 0 215 31
now, 0 215 31
I 0 215 31
have 0 215 31
taken 0 215 31
upon 0 215 31
me 0 215 31
to 0 215 31
speak 0 215 31
unto 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
Lord, 0 215 31
which 0 215 31
am 0 215 31
but 0 215 31
dust 0 215 31
and 0 215 31
ashes: 0 215 31
Peradventure 0 215 31
there 0 215 31
shall 0 215 31
lack 0 215 31
five 0 215 31
of 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
fifty 0 215 31
righteous: 1 215 31
wilt 0 215 31
thou 0 215 31
destroy 0 215 31
all 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
city 0 215 31
for 0 215 31
lack 0 215 31
of 0 215 31
five? 0 215 31

And 0 215 32
he 0 215 32
said, 0 215 32
If 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
find 0 215 32
there 0 215 32
forty 0 215 32
and 0 215 32
five, 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
will 0 215 32
not 0 215 32
destroy 0 215 32
it. 0 215 32

And 0 215 33
he 0 215 33
spake 0 215 33
unto 0 215 33
him 0 215 33
yet 0 215 33
again, 0 215 33
and 0 215 33
said, 0 215 33
Peradventure 0 215 33
there 0 215 33
shall 0 215 33
be 0 215 33
forty 0 215 33
found 0 215 33
there. 0 215 33

And 0 215 34
he 0 215 34
said, 0 215 34
I 0 215 34
will 0 215 34
not 0 215 34
do 0 215 34
it 0 215 34
for 0 215 34
forty's 0 215 34
sake. 0 215 34

And 0 215 35
he 0 215 35
said 0 215 35
unto 0 215 35
him, 0 215 35
Oh 0 215 35
let 0 215 35
not 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
Lord 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
angry, 0 215 35
and 0 215 35
I 0 215 35
will 0 215 35
speak: 0 215 35
Peradventure 0 215 35
there 0 215 35
shall 0 215 35
thirty 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
found 0 215 35
there. 0 215 35

And 0 215 36
he 0 215 36
said, 0 215 36
I 0 215 36
will 0 215 36
not 0 215 36
do 0 215 36
it, 0 215 36
if 0 215 36
I 0 215 36
find 0 215 36
thirty 0 215 36
there. 0 215 36

And 0 215 37
he 0 215 37
said, 0 215 37
Behold 0 215 37
now, 0 215 37
I 0 215 37
have 0 215 37
taken 0 215 37
upon 0 215 37
me 0 215 37
to 0 215 37

theLord: 0 215 37
Peradventure 0 215 37

twenty 0 215 37

And 0 215 38

I 0 215 39

but 0 215 39
this 0 215 39

Peradventure 0 215 39
ten 0 215 39

records 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
two 0 215 44
angels, 0 215 44
disguised 0 215 44
as 0 215 44
human 0 215 44
men, 0 215 44
visiting 0 215 44
Sodom 0 215 44

Lot 0 215 45
met 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
angels 0 215 45
in 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
city 0 215 45

urged 0 215 45
them 0 215 45
to 0 215 45
stay 0 215 45
at 0 215 45
his 0 215 45
house. 0 215 45

The 0 215 46
angels 0 215 46
agreed. 0 215 46

The 0 215 47
Bible 0 215 47
then 0 215 47
informs 0 215 47
us, 0 215 47
"Before 0 215 47
they 0 215 47
had 0 215 47
gone 0 215 47

all 0 215 47
the 0 215 47

wrath 0 215 50
that 0 215 50
God 0 215 50

about 0 215 50

Lot 0 215 51
and 0 215 51
his 0 215 51
family 0 215 51
flee 0 215 51
the 0 215 51
city, 0 215 51
and 0 215 51
then 0 215 51
"the 1 215 51
LORD 1 215 51

down 1 215 51

living 0 215 52
in 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
cities..." 0 215 52
(Genesis 0 215 52
19:2 0 215 52
4) 0 215 52
. 0 215 52

In 0 215 53
light 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
passage, 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
most 0 215 53
common 0 215 53
response 0 215 53
to 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
question, 0 215 53
"What 0 215 53
was 0 215 53
the 0 215 53
sin 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
Sodom 0 215 53
and 0 215 53
Gomorrah?" 0 215 53

is 0 215 54
that 0 215 54
it 0 215 54
was 0 215 54
homosexuality. 0 215 54

That 0 215 55
is 0 215 55
how 0 215 55
the 0 215 55
term 0 215 55
”sodomy” 0 215 55
came 0 215 55
to 0 215 55
be 0 215 55
used 0 215 55
to 0 215 55
refer 0 215 55
to 0 215 55
anal 0 215 55
sex 0 215 55
between 0 215 55
two 0 215 55
men, 0 215 55
whether 0 215 55
consensual 0 215 55
or 0 215 55
forced. 0 215 55

Clearly, 0 215 56
homosexuality 0 215 56
was 0 215 56
part 0 215 56
of 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
reason 0 215 56
God 0 215 56
destroyed 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
two 0 215 56
cities. 0 215 56

The 0 215 57
men 0 215 57
of 0 215 57
Sodom 0 215 57
and 0 215 57
Gomorrah 0 215 57
wanted 1 215 57
to 1 215 57
perform 1 215 57
homosexual 1 215 57
gang 1 215 57
rape 1 215 57
on 1 215 57
the 1 215 57
two 1 215 57
angels, 1 215 57
who 0 215 57
were 0 215 57
disguised 0 215 57
as 0 215 57
men. 0 215 57

At 0 215 58
the 0 215 58
same 0 215 58
time, 0 215 58
it 0 215 58
is 0 215 58
not 0 215 58
biblical 0 215 58
to 0 215 58
say 0 215 58
that 0 215 58
homosexuality 0 215 58
was 0 215 58
the 0 215 58
exclusive 0 215 58
reason 0 215 58
why 0 215 58
God 0 215 58
destroyed 0 215 58
Sodom 0 215 58
and 0 215 58
Gomorrah. 0 215 58

The 0 215 59
cities 0 215 59
of 0 215 59
Sodom 0 215 59
and 0 215 59
Gomorrah 0 215 59
were 0 215 59
definitely 0 215 59
not 0 215 59
exclusive 0 215 59
in 0 215 59
terms 0 215 59
of 0 215 59
the 0 215 59
sins 0 215 59
in 0 215 59
which 0 215 59
they 0 215 59
indulged. 0 215 59

Ezekiel 0 215 60
16:49-50 0 215 60
declares, 0 215 60
"Now 0 215 60
this 0 215 60
was 0 215 60
the 0 215 60
sin 0 215 60
of 0 215 60
your 0 215 60
sister 0 215 60
Sodom: 0 215 60
She 1 215 60
and 1 215 60
her 1 215 60
daughters 1 215 60
were 1 215 60
arrogant, 1 215 60
overfed 1 215 60
and 1 215 60
unconcerned; 1 215 60
they 1 215 60
did 1 215 60
not 1 215 60
help 1 215 60
the 1 215 60
poor 1 215 60
and 1 215 60
needy. 1 215 60

They 1 215 61
were 1 215 61
haughty 1 215 61
and 1 215 61
did 1 215 61
detestable 1 215 61
things 1 215 61
before 1 215 61
me..." 0 215 61
The 0 215 61
Hebrew 0 215 61
word 0 215 61
translated 0 215 61
"detestable" 0 215 61
refers 0 215 61
to 0 215 61
something 0 215 61
that 0 215 61
is 0 215 61
morally 1 215 61
disgusting 1 215 61
and 0 215 61
is 0 215 61
the 0 215 61
exact 0 215 61
same 0 215 61
word 0 215 61
used 0 215 61
in 0 215 61
Leviticus 0 215 61
18:22 0 215 61
that 0 215 61
refers 0 215 61
to 0 215 61
homosexuality 0 215 61
as 0 215 61
an 0 215 61
"abomination." 1 215 61

Similarly, 0 215 62
Jude 0 215 62
7 0 215 62
declares, 0 215 62
"...Sodom 0 215 62
and 0 215 62
Gomorrah 0 215 62
and 0 215 62
the 0 215 62
surrounding 0 215 62
towns 0 215 62
gave 1 215 62
themselves 1 215 62
up 1 215 62
to 1 215 62
sexual 1 215 62
immorality 1 215 62
and 1 215 62
perversion." 1 215 62

So, 0 215 63
again, 0 215 63
while 0 215 63
homosexuality 0 215 63
was 0 215 63
not 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
only 0 215 63
sin 0 215 63
in 0 215 63
which 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
cities 0 215 63
of 0 215 63
Sodom 0 215 63
and 0 215 63
Gomorrah 0 215 63
indulged, 0 215 63
it 0 215 63
does 0 215 63
appear 0 215 63
to 0 215 63
be 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
primary 0 215 63
reason 0 215 63
for 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
destruction 0 215 63
of 0 215 63
the 0 215 63
cities. 0 215 63

Those 0 215 64
who 0 215 64
attempt 0 215 64
to 0 215 64
explain 0 215 64
away 0 215 64
the 0 215 64
biblical 0 215 64
condemnations 0 215 64
of 0 215 64
homosexuality 0 215 64
claim 0 215 64
that 0 215 64
the 0 215 64
sin 0 215 64
of 0 215 64
Sodom 0 215 64
and 0 215 64
Gomorrah 0 215 64
was 0 215 64
inhospitality. 0 215 64

The 0 215 65
men 0 215 65
of 0 215 65
Sodom 0 215 65
and 0 215 65
Gomorrah 0 215 65
were 0 215 65
certainly 0 215 65
being 0 215 65
inhospitable. 0 215 65

There 1 215 66
is 1 215 66
probably 1 215 66
nothing 1 215 66
more 1 215 66
inhospitable 1 215 66
than 1 215 66
homosexual 1 215 66
gang 1 215 66
rape. 1 215 66

But 0 215 67
to 0 215 67
say 0 215 67
God 0 215 67
completely 0 215 67
destroyed 0 215 67
two 0 215 67
cities 0 215 67
and 0 215 67
all 0 215 67
their 0 215 67
inhabitants 0 215 67
for 0 215 67
being 0 215 67
inhospitable 0 215 67
clearly 0 215 67
misses 0 215 67
the 0 215 67
point. 0 215 67

While 0 215 68
Sodom 0 215 68
and 0 215 68
Gomorrah 0 215 68
were 0 215 68
guilty 0 215 68
of 0 215 68
many 0 215 68
other 0 215 68
horrendous 1 215 68
sins, 1 215 68
homosexuality 1 215 68
was 1 215 68
the 1 215 68
reason 1 215 68
God 1 215 68
poured 1 215 68
fiery 1 215 68
sulfur 1 215 68
on 1 215 68
the 1 215 68
cities, 1 215 68
completely 1 215 68
destroying 1 215 68
them 1 215 68
and 1 215 68
all 1 215 68
of 1 215 68
their 1 215 68
inhabitants. 1 215 68

To 0 215 69
this 0 215 69
day, 0 215 69
the 0 215 69
area 0 215 69
where 0 215 69
Sodom 0 215 69
and 0 215 69
Gomorrah 0 215 69
were 0 215 69
located 0 215 69
remains 0 215 69
a 0 215 69
desolate 0 215 69
wasteland. 0 215 69

Sodom 1 215 70
and 1 215 70
Gomorrah 1 215 70
serve 1 215 70
as 1 215 70
a 1 215 70
powerful 1 215 70
example 1 215 70
of 1 215 70
how 1 215 70
God 1 215 70
feels 1 215 70
about 1 215 70
sin 1 215 70
in 1 215 70
general, 1 215 70
and 1 215 70
homosexuality 1 215 70
specifically. 1 215 70

The 0 215 71
point 0 215 71
is 0 215 71
that 0 215 71
there 0 215 71
were 0 215 71
no 0 215 71
righteous 1 215 71
to 0 215 71
be 0 215 71
spared 0 215 71
and 0 215 71
the 0 215 71
Lord 0 215 71
did 0 215 71
what 0 215 71
man 0 215 71
failed 0 215 71
to 0 215 71
do 0 215 71
when 0 215 71
they 0 215 71
had 0 215 71
the 0 215 71
time 0 215 71
to 0 215 71
do 0 215 71
it. 0 215 71

Question: 0 215 72
How 1 215 72
do 1 215 72
you 1 215 72
show 1 215 72
mercy 1 215 72
to 1 215 72
a 1 215 72
people 1 215 72
who 1 215 72
observe 1 215 72
lying 1 215 72
vanities 1 215 72
(Jonah 1 215 72
2:4) 1 215 72
and 1 215 72
refuse 1 215 72
to 1 215 72
return 1 215 72
to 1 215 72
the 1 215 72
Lord 1 215 72
(Jeremiah 1 215 72
6:16) 1 215 72
on 1 215 72
His 1 215 72
terms? 1 215 72

(Jeremiah 0 215 73
22:3) 0 215 73
God 0 215 73
must 0 215 73
be 0 215 73
true 0 215 73
and 0 215 73
judgment 0 215 73
must 0 215 73
commence. 0 215 73

Men 0 215 74
today, 0 215 74
like 0 215 74
those 0 215 74
of 0 215 74
Sodom 0 215 74
and 0 215 74
Gomorrah, 0 215 74
are 0 215 74
not 0 215 74
valiant 0 215 74
for 0 215 74
the 0 215 74
truth. 0 215 74

They 0 215 75
are 0 215 75
valiant 0 215 75
to 0 215 75
proceed 0 215 75
from 0 215 75
evil 0 215 75
to 0 215 75
evil 0 215 75
(Jeremiah 0 215 75
5). 0 215 75

that 0 215 79
of 0 215 79

what 0 215 79

They 0 215 80
wear 0 215 80
the 0 215 80
cross. 0 215 80

Yet, 0 215 81
they 0 215 81
have 0 215 81
no 0 215 81
testimony 0 215 81
of 0 215 81

do 0 215 81
not 0 215 81

what 0 215 81
Christ 0 215 81
required: 0 215 81
“Deny 0 215 81
yourselves 0 215 81

Professed 1 215 82
Christians 1 215 82
in 1 215 82
America 1 215 82
today 1 215 82
talk 1 215 82
much 1 215 82
of 1 215 82
love 1 215 82
through 1 215 82
inaction, 1 215 82
and 1 215 82
yet 1 215 82
know 1 215 82
nothing 1 215 82
of 1 215 82
it 1 215 82
(1 1 215 82
John 1 215 82
3:18). 1 215 82

They 1 215 83
read 1 215 83
what 1 215 83
to 1 215 83
do, 1 215 83
but 1 215 83
do 1 215 83
it 1 215 83
not! 1 215 83

In 1 215 84
fact, 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
declare 1 215 84
and 1 215 84
proclaim 1 215 84
how 1 215 84
much 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
love 1 215 84
God, 1 215 84
and 1 215 84
yet 1 215 84
if 1 215 84
you 1 215 84
were 1 215 84
to 1 215 84
have 1 215 84
them 1 215 84
read 1 215 84
His 1 215 84
moral 1 215 84
law 1 215 84
and 1 215 84
look 1 215 84
to 1 215 84
their 1 215 84
own 1 215 84
lives, 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
would 1 215 84
find 1 215 84
how 1 215 84
much 1 215 84
they 1 215 84
actually 1 215 84
hate 1 215 84
God 1 215 84
through 1 215 84
their 1 215 84
actions 1 215 84
(Matthew 1 215 84
15:8). 1 215 84

Then 0 215 85
again, 0 215 85
these 0 215 85
were 0 215 85
the 0 215 85
same 0 215 85
types 0 215 85
of 0 215 85
people 0 215 85
in 0 215 85
Jerusalem 0 215 85
crying 0 215 85
out 0 215 85
"Crucify 0 215 85
him! 0 215 85

Crucify 0 215 86
him! 0 215 86

We 0 215 87

Caesar" 0 215 87
(John 0 215 87
19:15). 0 215 87

And 0 215 88
these 0 215 88
are 0 215 88
the 0 215 88
same 0 215 88
people 0 215 88
today 0 215 88
persecuting 0 215 88
living 0 215 88
Christians 0 215 88
while 0 215 88
praising 0 215 88
the 0 215 88
dead 0 215 88
ones 0 215 88
(Matthew 0 215 88
5:10). 0 215 88

They 0 215 89
continuously 0 215 89
preach 0 215 89
of 0 215 89
the 0 215 89
heroism 0 215 89
of 0 215 89
Abraham, 0 215 89
Moses, 0 215 89
Joshua, 0 215 89
David, 0 215 89
Gideon, 0 215 89
Samson 0 215 89
and 0 215 89
others 0 215 89
from 0 215 89
the 0 215 89
pulpit 0 215 89
and 0 215 89
fail 0 215 89
to 0 215 89
understand 0 215 89
what 0 215 89
these 0 215 89
men 0 215 89
were 0 215 89
doing 0 215 89
when 0 215 89
serving 0 215 89
their 0 215 89
generations 0 215 89
(Psalm 0 215 89
71:18-19; 0 215 89
Isaiah 0 215 89
51:4). 0 215 89

Today, 0 215 90
instead 0 215 90
of 0 215 90
doing 0 215 90
the 0 215 90
same, 0 215 90
they 0 215 90
simply 0 215 90
hide 0 215 90
under 0 215 90
a 0 215 90
false 0 215 90
grace 0 215 90
(Isaiah 0 215 90
30) 0 215 90
and 0 215 90
give 0 215 90
themselves 0 215 90
over 0 215 90
to 0 215 90
a 0 215 90
man, 0 215 90
the 0 215 90
president, 0 215 90
and 0 215 90
declare 0 215 90
end 0 215 90
times. 0 215 90

They 0 215 91
declare 0 215 91
we're 0 215 91
in 0 215 91
the 0 215 91
end 0 215 91
times 0 215 91
because 0 215 91
they 0 215 91
have 0 215 91
failed 0 215 91
to 0 215 91
stand 0 215 91
up 0 215 91
and 0 215 91
fight 0 215 91
for 0 215 91
their 0 215 91
posterity 0 215 91
in 0 215 91
keeping 0 215 91
the 0 215 91
Lord's 0 215 91
commandments 0 215 91
and 0 215 91
His 0 215 91
judgments 0 215 91
(Psalm 0 215 91
78:1-11). 0 215 91

Ungrateful 1 215 92
reprobates, 1 215 92
pretenders, 1 215 92
counterfeits 1 215 92
and 1 215 92
hypocrites 1 215 92
are 0 215 92
what 0 215 92
they 0 215 92
are 0 215 92
(Matthew 0 215 92
23:3). 0 215 92

Instead 1 215 93
of 1 215 93
reaching 1 215 93
out 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
the 1 215 93
greatest 1 215 93
demographic 1 215 93
here 1 215 93
in 1 215 93
America, 1 215 93
public 1 215 93
high 1 215 93
schools, 1 215 93
they 1 215 93
send 1 215 93
missionaries 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
foreign 1 215 93
lands 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
do 1 215 93
there 1 215 93
what 1 215 93
they 1 215 93
fail 1 215 93
to 1 215 93
do 1 215 93
for 1 215 93
their 1 215 93
own 1 215 93
here. 1 215 93

Instead 1 215 94
of 1 215 94
fighting 1 215 94
for 1 215 94
their 1 215 94
posterity 1 215 94
and 1 215 94
shutting 1 215 94
down 1 215 94
the 1 215 94
illegalities 1 215 94
of 1 215 94
sodomy 1 215 94
in 1 215 94
all 1 215 94
50 1 215 94
states, 1 215 94
they 1 215 94
teach 1 215 94
them 1 215 94
to 1 215 94
just 1 215 94
do 1 215 94
their 1 215 94
best 1 215 94
to 1 215 94
understand 1 215 94
that 1 215 94
they 1 215 94
cannot 1 215 94
help 1 215 94
themselves 1 215 94
while 1 215 94
God 1 215 94
say’s 1 215 94
the 1 215 94
opposite 1 215 94
(Leviticus 1 215 94
20:18). 1 215 94

Instead 1 215 95
of 1 215 95
fighting 1 215 95
on 1 215 95
their 1 215 95
behalf 1 215 95
against 1 215 95
the 1 215 95
federal 1 215 95
government 1 215 95
that 1 215 95
is 1 215 95
illegally 1 215 95
indoctrinating 1 215 95
them, 1 215 95
they 1 215 95
simply 1 215 95
give 1 215 95
their 1 215 95
kids 1 215 95
over 1 215 95
to 1 215 95
them 1 215 95
to 1 215 95
be 1 215 95
dumbed 1 215 95
down. 1 215 95

And 1 215 96
instead 1 215 96
of 1 215 96
protesting 1 215 96
the 1 215 96
murder 1 215 96
of 1 215 96
58 1 215 96
million 1 215 96
innocent 1 215 96
babies 1 215 96
(Proverbs 1 215 96
6:17), 1 215 96
they 1 215 96
merely 1 215 96
pass 1 215 96
it 1 215 96
off 1 215 96
as 1 215 96
a 1 215 96
"choice," 1 215 96
that 1 215 96
being 1 215 96
the 1 215 96
lessons 1 215 96
that 1 215 96
they 1 215 96
learned 1 215 96
from 1 215 96
the 1 215 96
media 1 215 96
that 1 215 96
they 1 215 96
say 1 215 96
that 1 215 96
they 1 215 96
do 1 215 96
not 1 215 96
believe 1 215 96
(Romans 1 215 96
1:18). 1 215 96

The 1 215 97
American 1 215 97
Church, 1 215 97
instead 1 215 97
of 1 215 97
protesting 1 215 97
corruption 1 215 97
in 1 215 97
government 1 215 97
through 1 215 97
the 1 215 97
example 1 215 97
of 1 215 97
the 1 215 97
Biblical 1 215 97
patriarchs 1 215 97
and 1 215 97
our 1 215 97
American 1 215 97
forefathers 1 215 97
(Matthew 1 215 97
5:17-18), 1 215 97
teach 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
submit 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
tyranny 1 215 97
as 1 215 97
if 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
suggest 1 215 97
that 1 215 97
it 1 215 97
is 1 215 97
somehow 1 215 97
obedience 1 215 97
to 1 215 97
God 1 215 97
(Romans 1 215 97
12:21). 1 215 97

The 1 215 98
Church 1 215 98
in 1 215 98
America 1 215 98
has 1 215 98
failed 1 215 98
to 1 215 98
keep 1 215 98
the 1 215 98
Commandments 1 215 98
of 1 215 98
the 1 215 98
God 1 215 98
of 1 215 98
Israel. 1 215 98

Instead 1 215 99
of 1 215 99
preaching 1 215 99
out 1 215 99
against 1 215 99
sin, 1 215 99
they 1 215 99
advocate 1 215 99
for 1 215 99
that 1 215 99
which 1 215 99
God 1 215 99
clearly 1 215 99
condemns, 1 215 99
thereby 1 215 99
making 1 215 99
war 1 215 99
against 1 215 99
God 1 215 99
(Micah 1 215 99
3:5), 1 215 99
which 1 215 99
at 1 215 99
length 1 215 99
destroys 1 215 99
our 1 215 99
government, 1 215 99
our 1 215 99
country 1 215 99
and 1 215 99
our 1 215 99
families. 1 215 99

Look 1 215 100
to 1 215 100
their 1 215 100

But 0 218 7
Tedros 0 218 7
voiced 0 218 7
alarm 0 218 7
that 0 218 7
"plague 0 218 7
in 0 218 7

behaved 0 218 7
in 0 218 7
a 1 218 7
very, 1 218 7
very 1 218 7
different 1 218 7
way 0 218 7
this 0 218 7
year." 0 218 7

Cases 0 218 8
sprang 0 218 8
up 0 218 8
far 0 218 8
earlier 0 218 8
than 0 218 8
usual 0 218 8
and, 0 218 8
instead 0 218 8
of 0 218 8
being 0 218 8
confined 0 218 8
to 0 218 8
the 0 218 8
countryside, 0 218 8
the 0 218 8
disease 0 218 8
infiltrated 0 218 8
towns. 0 218 8

The 0 218 9
authorities 0 218 9
recorded 0 218 9
more 0 218 9
than 0 218 9
2 0 218 9
000 0 218 9
cases, 0 218 9
and 0 218 9
Tedros 0 218 9
said 0 218 9
Wednesday 0 218 9
the 0 218 9
death 0 218 9
toll 0 218 9
stood 0 218 9
at 0 218 9
207. 0 218 9

He 1 218 10
also 1 218 10
pointed 1 218 10
to 1 218 10
the 1 218 10
presence 1 218 10
of 1 218 10
the 1 218 10
pneumonic 1 218 10
version, 1 218 10
which 1 218 10
spreads 1 218 10
more 1 218 10
easily 1 218 10
and 1 218 10
is 1 218 10
more 1 218 10
virulent, 1 218 10
in 1 218 10
the 1 218 10
latest 1 218 10
outbreak. 1 218 10

He 0 218 11
praised 0 218 11
the 0 218 11
rapid 0 218 11
response 0 218 11
from 0 218 11
WHO 0 218 11
and 0 218 11
Madagascar 0 218 11
authorities 0 218 11
that 0 218 11
helped 0 218 11
bring 0 218 11
the 0 218 11
outbreak 0 218 11
under 0 218 11
control, 0 218 11
but 1 218 11
warned 1 218 11
that 1 218 11
the 1 218 11
danger 1 218 11
was 1 218 11
not 1 218 11
over. 1 218 11

The 0 218 12
larger-than-usual 0 218 12
outbreak 0 218 12
had 0 218 12
helped 0 218 12
spread 0 218 12
the 0 218 12
bacteria 0 218 12
that 0 218 12
causes 0 218 12
the 0 218 12
plague 0 218 12
more 0 218 12
widely. 0 218 12

This 0 218 13
along 0 218 13
with 0 218 13
poor 0 218 13
sanitation 0 218 13
and 0 218 13
vector 0 218 13
control 0 218 13
on 0 218 13
Madagascar 0 218 13
meant 0 218 13
that 0 218 13
"when 1 218 13
(the 1 218 13
plague) 1 218 13
comes 1 218 13
again 1 218 13
it 1 218 13
starts 1 218 13
from 1 218 13
more 1 218 13
stock, 1 218 13
and 1 218 13
the 1 218 13
magnitude 1 218 13
in 1 218 13
the 1 218 13
next 1 218 13
transmission 1 218 13
could 1 218 13
be 1 218 13
higher 1 218 13
than 1 218 13
the 1 218 13
one 1 218 13
that 1 218 13
we 1 218 13
saw," 1 218 13
Tedros 0 218 13
said. 0 218 13

"That 0 218 14
means 0 218 14
that 0 218 14
Madagascar 0 218 14
could 0 218 14
be 0 218 14
affected 0 218 14
more, 0 218 14
and 0 218 14
not 0 218 14
only 0 218 14
that, 0 218 14
it 1 218 14
could 1 218 14
even 1 218 14
spill 1 218 14
over 1 218 14
into 1 218 14
neighbouring 1 218 14
countries 1 218 14
and 1 218 14
beyond," 1 218 14
he 0 218 14
warned. 0 218 14

Complicating 0 218 15
vector 0 218 15
control 0 218 15
is 0 218 15
the 0 218 15
fact 0 218 15
that 0 218 15
the 0 218 15
fleas 0 218 15
that 0 218 15
carry 0 218 15
the 0 218 15
Yersinia 0 218 15
pestis 0 218 15
bacteria 0 218 15
that 0 218 15
causes 0 218 15
the 0 218 15
plague 0 218 15
have 0 218 15
proven 0 218 15
to 0 218 15

resistant 0 218 15
to 0 218 15
chemicals 0 218 15
and 0 218 15
insecticides. 0 218 15

"That's 0 218 16
a 0 218 16
dangerous 0 218 16
combination," 0 218 16

“We’re 0 219 11

he 0 219 15
only 0 219 15
wanted 0 219 15
service 0 219 15

federal 0 219 15

was 0 219 15
a 0 219 15

out 0 219 17

Saucier, 0 219 20
31, 0 219 20
said 0 219 20
that 0 219 20
the 0 219 20
pardon 0 219 20
has 0 219 20
enabled 0 219 20
him 0 219 20

up 0 219 20
the 0 219 20

young 0 219 20
daughter. 0 219 20

A 0 219 21
felony 0 219 21
conviction 0 219 21
left 0 219 21
him 0 219 21
scrambling 0 219 21
to 0 219 21
find 0 219 21
work; 0 219 21
he 0 219 21
finally 0 219 21
landed 0 219 21
a 0 219 21
job 0 219 21
collecting 0 219 21
garbage. 0 219 21

Now, 0 219 22
he 0 219 22
works 0 219 22
on 0 219 22
design 0 219 22
and 0 219 22
engineering 0 219 22

Saucier 0 219 23
said. 0 219 23

“I 0 219 24
work 0 219 24

of 0 219 25
the 0 219 25
loss 0 219 25
of 0 219 25

during 0 219 25
his 0 219 25
imprisonment, 0 219 25
as 0 219 25
well 0 219 25
as 0 219 25
earning 0 219 25
below 0 219 25
his 0 219 25
potential 0 219 25
when 0 219 25
he 0 219 25
collected 0 219 25
garbage, 0 219 25
he 0 219 25
and 0 219 25
his 0 219 25
wife 0 219 25
Sadie 0 219 25
lost 0 219 25
their 0 219 25

Debt 0 219 26
collectors 0 219 26
called 0 219 26
and 0 219 26
his 0 219 26
cars 0 219 26
were 0 219 26
repossessed. 0 219 26

“With 0 219 27
a 0 219 27
pardon 0 219 27
there’s 0 219 27
no 0 219 27
magic 0 219 27

that 0 219 27
that 0 219 27

makes 0 219 27
everything 0 219 27
right,” 0 219 27

He 0 219 28
praises 0 219 28
the 0 219 28
pardons 0 219 28
that 0 219 28
Trump 0 219 28

granted, 0 219 28
and 0 219 28
takes 0 219 28
exception 0 219 28
at 0 219 28
the 0 219 28
criticism. 0 219 28

“The 0 219 29

there 0 223 20

fact 0 223 20

not 0 223 20

that 0 223 20

too, 0 223 20
kissed 0 223 20

this 0 223 21
appeal: 0 223 21
"Please 0 223 21

don't 1 223 21
be 1 223 21

are 0 223 22
so 0 223 22
many 0 223 22
of 0 223 22
us 0 223 22
who 0 223 22
despite 0 223 22
everything 0 223 22
think 0 223 22
that 0 223 22
you 0 223 22
can 0 223 22

something. 0 223 22

I 0 223 23

Blatantly 1 224 0
Telling 1 224 0

no 0 224 1
secret 0 224 1
that 0 224 1
the 0 224 1
Trump 0 224 1
administration 0 224 1
has 0 224 1
a 0 224 1
strong 0 224 1
distaste 0 224 1
for 0 224 1
Iran. 0 224 1

Iran 0 224 2
is 0 224 2
one 0 224 2
of 0 224 2
the 0 224 2
only 0 224 2
issues 0 224 2
on 0 224 2
which 0 224 2
the 0 224 2
U.S. 0 224 2
president 0 224 2
has 0 224 2
remained 0 224 2
relatively 0 224 2
consistent. 0 224 2

Trump 0 224 3
berated 0 224 3
the 0 224 3
country 0 224 3
both 0 224 3
before 0 224 3
and 0 224 3
after 0 224 3
taking 0 224 3
office. 0 224 3

However, 0 224 4
Trump’s 0 224 4
anti-Iran 0 224 4
strategy 0 224 4
goes 1 224 4
against 1 224 4
the 1 224 4
better 1 224 4
judgment 1 224 4
of 0 224 4
even 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
most 0 224 4
anti-Iranian 1 224 4
advisors 1 224 4
in 1 224 4
his 1 224 4
staff 1 224 4
who 1 224 4

want 1 224 4

see 1 224 4
the 1 224 4
U.S. 1 224 4
isolated 1 224 4
on 1 224 4
the 1 224 4
world 1 224 4
stage. 1 224 4

Fortunately 0 224 5
for 0 224 5
Trump, 0 224 5
however, 0 224 5
he 0 224 5
is 0 224 5
not 0 224 5
alone 0 224 5
in 0 224 5
his 0 224 5
bid 0 224 5
to 0 224 5

that 0 224 7

not 0 224 7
sit 0 224 7

“If 1 224 8

“There 0 224 9

Judge 0 227 6

issued 0 227 6
a 0 227 6
statement 0 227 6
on 0 227 6
Friday 0 227 6
in 0 227 6
which 0 227 6
he 0 227 6
said, 0 227 6
"I 0 227 6

I 0 227 7

Senator 0 227 8
Dianne 0 227 8
Feinstein 0 227 8
(D-Calif.), 0 227 8
the 0 227 8
ranking 0 227 8

on 0 227 8
the 0 227 8
Senate 0 227 8

Committee 0 227 8
that 0 227 8

public 0 227 8
testimony 0 227 8
earlier 0 227 8
this 0 227 8
month 0 227 8
during 0 227 8
his 0 227 8
Supreme 0 227 8
Court 0 227 8
confirmation 0 227 8
hearing, 0 227 8
had 0 227 8
received 0 227 8
last 0 227 8
July 0 227 8
a 0 227 8
copy 0 227 8
of 0 227 8
a 0 227 8
letter 0 227 8
written 0 227 8
by 0 227 8
the 0 227 8
woman 0 227 8
making 0 227 8
the 0 227 8
charge, 0 227 8
who 0 227 8
we 0 227 8
now 0 227 8
know 0 227 8
was 0 227 8
Ms. 0 227 8
Ford. 0 227 8

Even 0 227 9
though 0 227 9
Senator 0 227 9
Feinstein 0 227 9
had 0 227 9
the 0 227 9
letter 0 227 9
in 0 227 9
hand, 0 227 9
she 0 227 9
never 0 227 9
brought 0 227 9
up 0 227 9
the 0 227 9
charge 0 227 9
during 0 227 9
the 0 227 9
public 0 227 9
hearing, 0 227 9
nor 0 227 9
during 0 227 9
her 0 227 9
own 0 227 9
meeting 0 227 9
with 0 227 9
the 0 227 9
judge. 0 227 9

Instead, 0 227 10
Senator 0 227 10
Feinstein 0 227 10
sat 0 227 10
on 0 227 10
the 0 227 10
letter 0 227 10
until 0 227 10
late 0 227 10
last 0 227 10
week, 0 227 10
when 0 227 10
she 0 227 10
issued 0 227 10
a 0 227 10
cryptic 0 227 10
release 0 227 10
stating 0 227 10
that 0 227 10
she 0 227 10
had 0 227 10
received 0 227 10
the 0 227 10
letter 0 227 10
but 0 227 10
did 0 227 10
not 0 227 10
want 0 227 10
to 0 227 10
give 0 227 10
more 0 227 10
details 0 227 10
in 0 227 10
deference 0 227 10
to 0 227 10
the 0 227 10
woman’s 0 227 10
wish 0 227 10
to 0 227 10
keep 0 227 10
the 0 227 10
matter 0 227 10
confidential. 0 227 10

Senator 0 227 11
Feinstein 0 227 11
turned 0 227 11
the 0 227 11
letter 0 227 11
over 0 227 11
to 0 227 11
the 0 227 11
FBI. 0 227 11

The 0 227 12
FBI 0 227 12
placed 0 227 12
the 0 227 12
letter 0 227 12
in 0 227 12
its 0 227 12
background 0 227 12
file 0 227 12
on 0 227 12
Judge 0 227 12
Kavanaugh 0 227 12
but 0 227 12
decided 0 227 12
not 0 227 12
to 0 227 12
pursue 0 227 12
any 0 227 12
further 0 227 12
investigation. 0 227 12

Senator 0 227 13
Feinstein 0 227 13
had 0 227 13
initially 0 227 13
resisted 0 227 13
sharing 0 227 13
the 0 227 13
contents 0 227 13
of 0 227 13
the 0 227 13
letter 0 227 13
with 0 227 13
her 0 227 13
fellow 0 227 13
Democrat 0 227 13
members 0 227 13
of 0 227 13
the 0 227 13
Senate 0 227 13
Judiciary 0 227 13
Committee 0 227 13
or 0 227 13
to 0 227 13
go 0 227 13
public 0 227 13
with 0 227 13
its 0 227 13
existence 0 227 13
because 0 227 13
“the 0 227 13
incident 0 227 13
was 0 227 13
too 0 227 13
distant 0 227 13
in 0 227 13
the 0 227 13
past 0 227 13
to 0 227 13
merit 0 227 13
public 0 227 13
discussion” 0 227 13
and 0 227 13
she 0 227 13
had 0 227 13
already 0 227 13
“taken 0 227 13
care 0 227 13
of 0 227 13
it,” 0 227 13
according 0 227 13
to 0 227 13

quoted 0 227 13
by 0 227 13
The 0 227 13
New 0 227 13

Nevertheless, 0 227 14
Senator 0 227 14
Feinstein 0 227 14
evidently 0 227 14
bowed 0 227 14
to 0 227 14
pressure 0 227 14
from 0 227 14
her 0 227 14

to 0 227 19
the 0 227 19
Washington 0 227 19

that 0 227 19

While 0 227 20
his 0 227 20
friend 0 227 20
watched, 0 227 20
she 0 227 20
said, 0 227 20
Kavanaugh 0 227 20
pinned 0 227 20
her 0 227 20
to 0 227 20
a 0 227 20
bed 0 227 20
on 0 227 20
her 0 227 20
back 0 227 20
and 0 227 20
groped 0 227 20
her 0 227 20
over 0 227 20
her 0 227 20
clothes, 0 227 20
grinding 0 227 20
his 0 227 20
body 0 227 20
against 0 227 20
hers 0 227 20

clumsily 0 227 20
attempting 0 227 20
to 0 227 20

off 0 227 20
her 0 227 20
one-piece 0 227 20

she 0 227 21
tried 0 227 21
to 0 227 21
scream, 0 227 21
she 0 227 21
said, 0 227 21
he 0 227 21

Ms. 0 227 23
Ford 0 227 23

she 0 227 23

without 0 227 23
any 0 227 23
apparent 0 227 23
further 0 227 23

after 0 227 23
“Kavanaugh’s 0 227 23

all 0 227 23
three 0 227 23
tumbling.” 0 227 23

Here 0 227 24
is 0 227 24
where 0 227 24
Ms. 0 227 24
Ford’s 0 227 24
story 0 227 24
becomes 0 227 24
quite 0 227 24
murky 0 227 24
and 0 227 24
begins 0 227 24
to 0 227 24
fall 0 227 24
apart. 0 227 24

Although 0 227 25
Ms. 0 227 25
Ford 0 227 25
believes 0 227 25
the 0 227 25
alleged 0 227 25
incident 0 227 25
occurred 0 227 25
during 0 227 25
the 0 227 25
summer 0 227 25
of 0 227 25
1982, 0 227 25
she 0 227 25
“said 0 227 25
she 0 227 25
does 0 227 25
not 0 227 25
remember 0 227 25
some 0 227 25
key 0 227 25
details 0 227 25
of 0 227 25
the 0 227 25
incident,” 0 227 25
according 0 227 25
to 0 227 25
the 0 227 25
Washington 0 227 25
Post 0 227 25
article. 0 227 25

For 0 227 26
example, 0 227 26
Ms. 0 227 26
Ford 0 227 26
“said 0 227 26
she 0 227 26
does 0 227 26
not 0 227 26
remember 0 227 26
how 0 227 26
the 0 227 26

came 0 227 26
together 0 227 26
the 0 227 26
night 0 227 26
of 0 227 26
the 0 227 26

She 0 227 26
also 0 227 26
does 0 227 26
not 0 227 26
remember 0 227 26
how 0 227 26
she 0 227 26
got 0 227 26
home. 0 227 26

Yet 0 227 27
she 0 227 27
claims 0 227 27
to 0 227 27
be 0 227 27
absolutely 0 227 27
certain 0 227 27
that 0 227 27
Kavanaugh, 0 227 27
whom 0 227 27
she 0 227 27
presumably 0 227 27
knew 0 227 27
only 0 227 27
as 0 227 27
an 0 227 27
acquaintance 0 227 27
and 0 227 27
said 0 227 27
she 0 227 27
had 0 227 27
not 0 227 27
spoken 0 227 27
to 0 227 27
since 0 227 27
the 0 227 27
night 0 227 27
the 0 227 27
incident 0 227 27
allegedly 0 227 27
occurred, 0 227 27
was 0 227 27
involved 0 227 27
in 0 227 27
the 0 227 27
alleged 0 227 27
incident. 0 227 27

Ms. 0 227 28
Ford 0 227 28
admitted 0 227 28
that 0 227 28
she 0 227 28
“told 0 227 28
no 0 227 28
one 0 227 28
at 0 227 28
the 0 227 28
time 0 227 28
what 0 227 28
had 0 227 28
happened 0 227 28
to 0 227 28
her.” 0 227 28
In 0 227 28
fact, 0 227 28
she 0 227 28
said 0 227 28
she 0 227 28
recalled 0 227 28
thinking: 0 227 28
“I’m 0 227 28
not 0 227 28
ever 0 227 28
telling 0 227 28
anyone 0 227 28
this. 0 227 28

This 0 227 29
is 0 227 29
nothing, 0 227 29
it 0 227 29
didn’t 0 227 29
happen, 0 227 29
and 0 227 29
he 0 227 29
didn’t 0 227 29
rape 0 227 29
me.” 0 227 29
Even 0 227 29
if 0 227 29
one 0 227 29
explains 0 227 29
this 0 227 29
behavior 0 227 29
as 0 227 29
the 0 227 29
natural 0 227 29

of 0 227 29
a 0 227 29

to 0 227 29
a 0 227 29

her 0 227 29

Ms. 1 227 34

We 0 227 36
are 0 227 36
women 0 227 36
who 0 227 36
have 0 227 36
known 0 227 36

35 0 227 36
years 0 227 36
and 0 227 36
knew 0 227 36
him 0 227 36

For 1 227 37
the 1 227 37
entire 1 227 37

we 1 227 37
have 1 227 37

Kavanaugh, 1 227 37
he 1 227 37
has 1 227 37
behaved 1 227 37
honorably 1 227 37
and 1 227 37
treated 1 227 37
women 1 227 37
with 1 227 37
respect… 1 227 37
Brett 0 227 37

high 0 227 37
school 0 227 37
in 0 227 37
Rockville, 0 227 37
Maryland. 0 227 37

He 0 227 38
was 0 227 38
an 0 227 38
outstanding 0 227 38
student 0 227 38
and 0 227 38
athlete 0 227 38
with 0 227 38
a 0 227 38
wide 0 227 38
circle 0 227 38
of 0 227 38
friends. 0 227 38

Almost 0 227 39
all 0 227 39
of 0 227 39
us 0 227 39
attended 0 227 39
all-girls 0 227 39
high 0 227 39
schools 0 227 39
in 0 227 39
the 0 227 39
area. 0 227 39

We 0 227 40
knew 0 227 40
Brett 0 227 40
well 0 227 40
through 0 227 40
social 0 227 40
events, 0 227 40
sports, 0 227 40
church, 0 227 40
and 0 227 40
various 0 227 40
other 0 227 40
activities. 0 227 40

Many 0 227 41
of 0 227 41
us 0 227 41
have 0 227 41
remained 0 227 41
close 0 227 41
friends 0 227 41
with 0 227 41
him 0 227 41
and 0 227 41
his 0 227 41
family 0 227 41
over 0 227 41
the 0 227 41
years. 0 227 41

Through 0 227 42
the 0 227 42
more 0 227 42
than 0 227 42
35 0 227 42
years 0 227 42
we 0 227 42
have 0 227 42
known 0 227 42
him, 0 227 42
Brett 0 227 42
has 0 227 42
stood 0 227 42
out 0 227 42
for 0 227 42
his 0 227 42
friendship, 0 227 42
character, 0 227 42
and 0 227 42
integrity. 0 227 42

In 0 227 43
particular, 0 227 43
he 0 227 43
has 0 227 43
always 0 227 43
treated 0 227 43
women 0 227 43
with 0 227 43
decency 0 227 43
and 0 227 43
respect. 0 227 43

That 0 227 44
was 0 227 44
true 0 227 44
when 0 227 44
he 0 227 44
was 0 227 44
in 0 227 44
high 0 227 44
school, 0 227 44
and 0 227 44
it 0 227 44
has 0 227 44
remained 0 227 44
true 0 227 44
to 0 227 44
this 0 227 44
day. 0 227 44

The 0 227 45
signers 0 227 45
of 0 227 45
this 0 227 45
letter 0 227 45
hold 0 227 45
a 0 227 45
broad 0 227 45
range 0 227 45
of 0 227 45
political 0 227 45
views. 0 227 45

Many 0 227 46
of 0 227 46
us 0 227 46
are 0 227 46
not 0 227 46
lawyers, 0 227 46
but 0 227 46
we 0 227 46
know 0 227 46
Brett 0 227 46
Kavanaugh 0 227 46
as 0 227 46
a 0 227 46
person. 0 227 46

And 0 227 47
he 0 227 47
has 0 227 47
always 0 227 47
been 0 227 47
a 0 227 47
good 0 227 47
person. 0 227 47

Nevertheless, 0 227 48
using 0 227 48
their 1 227 48
standard 1 227 48
contemptible, 1 227 48
obstructionist 1 227 48
tactics, 1 227 48
the 0 227 48
Democrats 0 227 48
opposed 0 227 48
to 0 227 48
Judge 0 227 48
Kavanaugh 0 227 48
happily 0 227 48
seized 0 227 48
on 0 227 48
the 0 227 48
unsubstantiated 0 227 48
allegation 0 227 48
of 0 227 48
teen 0 227 48
sexual 0 227 48
misbehavior 0 227 48
in 0 227 48
high 0 227 48

to 0 227 48
assassinate 1 227 48
Judge 1 227 48
Kavanaugh’s 1 227 48
character. 1 227 48

They 0 227 49
have 0 227 49
done 0 227 49
so 0 227 49
in 0 227 49
the 0 227 49
face 0 227 49
of 0 227 49
Judge 0 227 49
Kavanaugh’s 0 227 49
lifetime 0 227 49
record 0 227 49
of 0 227 49
stellar 0 227 49
public 0 227 49

multiple 0 227 49
background 0 227 49
checks 0 227 49
producing 0 227 49
no 0 227 49
evidence 0 227 49
of 0 227 49
sexual 0 227 49
misconduct, 0 227 49
and 0 227 49
the 0 227 49
letter 0 227 49
written 0 227 49
by 0 227 49
the 0 227 49

he 0 227 49
was 0 227 49
in 0 227 49

and 0 227 49
thereafter 0 227 49
and 0 227 49
who 0 227 49
signed 0 227 49
their 0 227 49
names 0 227 49
to 0 227 49
a 0 227 49
ringing 0 227 49
endorsement 0 227 49
of 0 227 49
his 0 227 49

(D-N.Y.) 0 227 53

other 0 227 53
Democrats, 0 227 53
including 0 227 53
Senator 0 227 53
Feinstein, 0 227 53
have 0 227 53
called 0 227 53
for 0 227 53
the 0 227 53
Senate 0 227 53
to 0 227 53
postpone 0 227 53
a 0 227 53
vote 0 227 53
on 0 227 53

"Senator 0 227 54
Grassley 0 227 54
must 0 227 54
postpone 0 227 54
the 0 227 54
vote 0 227 54
until, 0 227 54
at 0 227 54
a 0 227 54
very 0 227 54
minimum, 0 227 54
these 0 227 54
serious 0 227 54
and 0 227 54
credible 0 227 54
allegations 0 227 54
are 0 227 54
thoroughly 0 227 54
investigated,” 0 227 54
Senator 0 227 54
Schumer 0 227 54
said. 0 227 54

If 0 227 55
a 0 227 55
thorough 0 227 55
investigation 0 227 55
was 0 227 55
considered 0 227 55
to 0 227 55
be 0 227 55
so 0 227 55
important, 0 227 55
why 1 227 55
didn't 1 227 55
Senator 1 227 55
Feinstein 1 227 55
set 1 227 55
the 1 227 55
ball 1 227 55
rolling 1 227 55
back 1 227 55
in 1 227 55
July 1 227 55
when 1 227 55
she 1 227 55
first 1 227 55
received 1 227 55
word 1 227 55
of 1 227 55
the 1 227 55
allegation? 1 227 55

The 0 227 56
answer 0 227 56
is 0 227 56
that 0 227 56
this 1 227 56
is 1 227 56
all 1 227 56
a 1 227 56
ruse 1 227 56
to 1 227 56
block 1 227 56
Judge 1 227 56
Kavanaugh's 1 227 56
confirmation 1 227 56
by 1 227 56
all 1 227 56
means 1 227 56
necessary. 1 227 56

Senator 0 227 57
Schumer 0 227 57
is 0 227 57
fulfilling 0 227 57
his 0 227 57
promise 0 227 57
to 0 227 57
oppose 0 227 57
Judge 0 227 57
Kavanaugh 0 227 57
with 0 227 57
"everything 0 227 57
I've 0 227 57
got." 0 227 57

As 0 227 58
of 0 227 58
now, 0 227 58
the 0 227 58
Senate 0 227 58
Judiciary 0 227 58
Committee 0 227 58

Judge 0 227 58
Kavanaugh's 0 227 58
nomination 0 227 58
as 0 227 58
scheduled. 0 227 58

It 0 227 59
is 0 227 59
time 0 227 59
for 0 227 59
the 0 227 59
Democrat 0 227 59

their 1 227 59

Couple 0 228 0
question 0 228 0
why 1 228 0

waited 1 228 0
so 1 228 0
long 1 228 0
to 1 228 0

A 0 228 1
New 0 228 1
Mexico 0 228 1
couple 0 228 1
told 0 228 1
authorities 0 228 1
months 0 228 1
ago 0 228 1
they 0 228 1
thought 0 228 1
a 0 228 1
missing 0 228 1

boy 0 228 1
and 0 228 1
his 1 228 1
fugitive 1 228 1

were 0 228 1
living 0 228 1
in 0 228 1

filthy 1 228 1

on 0 228 1
their 0 228 1

But 0 228 2

did 0 228 2
not 0 228 2
carry 0 228 2
out 0 228 2
a 0 228 2

because 0 228 2
they 0 228 2
did 0 228 2
not 0 228 2

they 0 228 2

in 0 228 2
the 0 228 2

That 0 228 3
delay 0 228 3
is 0 228 3
facing 0 228 3
scrutiny 0 228 3
in 0 228 3
the 0 228 3

"They 1 228 4

were 1 228 5

said 0 228 5
Tanya 0 228 5

who 0 228 5
with 0 228 5
her 0 228 5

"Even 1 228 6

New 0 228 16
Mexico 0 228 16

the 0 228 16

might 0 228 16

there 0 228 17

They 1 228 40

"When 1 228 41
we 1 228 41

Abdul-Ghani's 0 228 44

But 0 228 45
hours 0 228 45
earlier, 0 228 45
Ramzi 0 228 45

CNN 0 228 45
she 0 228 45
had 0 228 45
no 0 228 45

"My 0 228 46
husband 0 228 46

he 0 228 46
was 0 228 46
taking 0 228 46
Abdul-Ghani 0 228 46
to 0 228 46
the 0 228 46

and 0 228 46
didn't 0 228 46

That 0 228 47
was 0 228 47
in 0 228 47
November 0 228 47
2017. 0 228 47

When 0 228 48
I 0 228 48
would 0 228 48
ask 0 228 48
him 0 228 48
where 0 228 48
he 0 228 48
was, 0 228 48
he 0 228 48
said 0 228 48
he 0 228 48
was 0 228 48
on 0 228 48
his 0 228 48
way, 0 228 48
he 0 228 48
was 0 228 48

just 0 228 48
keeping 0 228 48
him 0 228 48
for 0 228 48
the 0 228 48
night. 0 228 48

But 0 228 49
I 0 228 49
haven't 0 228 49
seen 0 228 49

then," 0 228 49
Ramzi 0 228 49

walk 0 228 50

suffers 0 228 50
seizures, 0 228 50
and 0 228 50
requires 0 228 50
constant 0 228 50
medical 0 228 50
attention. 0 228 50

An 0 228 51
arrest 0 228 51

states 0 228 51
that 0 228 51
Wahhaj 0 228 51

an 1 228 51
exorcism" 1 228 51
on 0 228 51
the 0 228 51

was 1 228 51
possessed 1 228 51
by 1 228 51
the 1 228 51

But 0 228 52
Ramzi 0 228 52
said 0 228 52

"It's 0 228 53
not 0 228 53
an 0 228 53

Siraj 0 228 59

Georgia 0 228 59
with 0 228 59
his 0 228 59
young 0 228 59

But 0 228 60
at 0 228 60
the 0 228 60
time, 0 228 60
the 0 228 60
group 0 228 60
told 0 228 60

Even 0 228 61
though 0 228 61
the 0 228 61

The 0 228 62
SUV 0 228 62
was 0 228 62
registered 0 228 62
to 0 228 62
Leveille, 0 228 62
who 0 228 62
was 0 228 62
also 0 228 62
in 0 228 62
the 0 228 62
vehicle. 0 228 62

She 0 228 63
would 0 228 63
later 0 228 63
become 0 228 63
one 0 228 63
of 0 228 63
the 0 228 63
five 0 228 63

Still, 0 230 1
we’re 0 230 1
also 0 230 1
averse 0 230 1
to 0 230 1
speaking 0 230 1
in 0 230 1
terms 0 230 1
of 0 230 1
good 0 230 1
and 0 230 1
evil. 0 230 1

Right 0 230 2
and 0 230 2
wrong? 0 230 2

Maybe. 0 230 3

But 0 230 4
good 0 230 4
and 0 230 4
evil 0 230 4
have 0 230 4
a 0 230 4
supernatural 0 230 4
ring 0 230 4
we 0 230 4
usually 0 230 4
reserve 0 230 4
for 0 230 4
dramatic 0 230 4
and 0 230 4
abominable 1 230 4
crimes, 0 230 4
like 0 230 4
genocide. 1 230 4

Yet 1 230 5
everything 1 230 5
right 1 230 5
is 1 230 5
good, 1 230 5
and 1 230 5
everything 1 230 5
wrong 1 230 5
is 1 230 5
evil. 1 230 5

The 0 230 6
evils 0 230 6
we 0 230 6
encounter 0 230 6
in 0 230 6
our 0 230 6
day-to-day 0 230 6
lives 0 230 6
might 0 230 6
not 0 230 6
be 0 230 6
a 0 230 6
spectacle, 0 230 6
like 0 230 6
jihadists 0 230 6
beheading 0 230 6
a 0 230 6
journalist 0 230 6
on 0 230 6

All 0 230 7
the 0 230 7
same, 0 230 7
evil 0 230 7
is 0 230 7
part 0 230 7
of 0 230 7
ordinary 0 230 7
life. 0 230 7

It 0 230 8
dwells 0 230 8
deep 0 230 8
in 0 230 8
our 0 230 8
hearts 0 230 8
– 0 230 8
each 0 230 8
and 0 230 8
every 0 230 8
one 0 230 8
of 0 230 8
us. 0 230 8

The 0 230 9
Prince 1 230 9
of 1 230 9
this 1 230 9
World 1 230 9
has 0 230 9
made 0 230 9
a 0 230 9
grand 0 230 9
display 0 230 9
of 0 230 9
his 0 230 9

in 0 230 9
the 0 230 9
last 0 230 9
few 0 230 9
centuries. 0 230 9

Our 0 230 10

is 0 230 10
that, 0 230 10
while 0 230 10
Westerners 0 230 10
no 0 230 10
longer 0 230 10
believe 0 230 10
in 0 230 10
God, 0 230 10
they 0 230 10
still 0 230 10
believe 0 230 10
in 0 230 10
the 0 230 10
Devil. 0 230 10

We’re 0 230 11
at 0 230 11
least 0 230 11
clear-eyed 0 230 11
enough 0 230 11
to 0 230 11
recognize 0 230 11
true 0 230 11
evil 0 230 11
at 0 230 11
work 0 230 11
in 0 230 11
the 0 230 11
world, 0 230 11
even 0 230 11
if 0 230 11
we 0 230 11
can 0 230 11
no 0 230 11
longer 0 230 11
see 0 230 11
the 0 230 11
great 0 230 11
Good 0 230 11
hidden 0 230 11
behind 0 230 11
the 0 230 11
veil. 0 230 11

This 0 230 12
is 0 230 12
the 0 230 12
point 0 230 12
about 0 230 12
the 0 230 12
McCarrick 0 230 12
scandal 0 230 12
that 0 230 12
even 0 230 12
religious 0 230 12
commentators 0 230 12
tend 0 230 12
to 0 230 12
overlook. 0 230 12

How 0 230 13
was 0 230 13
he 0 230 13
allowed 0 230 13
to 0 230 13
go 0 230 13
on 0 230 13
molesting 0 230 13
young 0 230 13
priests 0 230 13
and 0 230 13
seminarians 0 230 13
when 0 230 13
virtually 0 230 13
the 0 230 13
entire 0 230 13
Church 0 230 13
hierarchy 0 230 13
knew 0 230 13
what 0 230 13
he 0 230 13
was 0 230 13
up 0 230 13
to? 0 230 13

And 0 230 14
how 0 230 14
was 0 230 14
such 0 230 14
a 0 230 14
depraved 1 230 14
individual 0 230 14
ordained 0 230 14
in 0 230 14
the 0 230 14
first 0 230 14
place, 0 230 14
let 0 230 14
alone 0 230 14
promoted 0 230 14
to 0 230 14
Cardinal-Archbishop 0 230 14
of 0 230 14
Washington? 0 230 14

The 0 230 15
answer 0 230 15
is, 0 230 15
ultimately, 0 230 15
demonic. 1 230 15

As 0 230 16
Catholics, 0 230 16
we 0 230 16
ask 0 230 16
St. 0 230 16
Michael 0 230 16
to 0 230 16
“cast 0 230 16
into 0 230 16
Hell 0 230 16
Satan 0 230 16
and 0 230 16
all 0 230 16
the 0 230 16
evil 0 230 16
spirits 0 230 16
who 0 230 16
prowl 0 230 16
about 0 230 16
the 0 230 16
world 0 230 16
seeking 0 230 16
the 0 230 16
ruin 0 230 16
of 0 230 16
souls.” 0 230 16
McCarrick 0 230 16
and 0 230 16
his 0 230 16
fellow 0 230 16
perverts 1 230 16
in 0 230 16
the 0 230 16
clergy 0 230 16
are 0 230 16
responsible, 0 230 16
not 0 230 16
only 0 230 16
for 0 230 16
their 0 230 16
sexual 0 230 16
abuses, 0 230 16
but 0 230 16
also 0 230 16
for 0 230 16
chasing 0 230 16
good 0 230 16
men 0 230 16
away 0 230 16
from 0 230 16
the 0 230 16
priesthood. 0 230 16

Spend 0 230 17
enough 0 230 17
time 0 230 17
in 0 230 17
Catholic 0 230 17
World 0 230 17
and 0 230 17
you 0 230 17
inevitably 0 230 17
meet 0 230 17
good 0 230 17
men 0 230 17
who 0 230 17
quit 0 230 17
the 0 230 17
seminary 0 230 17
because 0 230 17
of 0 230 17
some 0 230 17
rampant 1 230 17
(and 0 230 17
often 0 230 17
violent) 0 230 17
depravity. 0 230 17

What 0 230 18
could 0 230 18
suit 0 230 18
the 0 230 18
Devil 0 230 18
more 0 230 18
than 0 230 18
to 0 230 18
watch 0 230 18
the 0 230 18
Church 0 230 18
burn 0 230 18
her 0 230 18
wheat 0 230 18
as 0 230 18
she 0 230 18
gathers 0 230 18
the 0 230 18
chaff? 0 230 18

The 0 230 19
gates 0 230 19
of 0 230 19
Hell 0 230 19
will 0 230 19
not 0 230 19
prevail 0 230 19
against 0 230 19
the 0 230 19
Church, 0 230 19
as 0 230 19
Our 0 230 19
Lord 0 230 19
promised. 0 230 19

But 0 230 20
they 0 230 20
won’t 0 230 20
stop 0 230 20
trying, 0 230 20
either. 0 230 20

They’ve 0 230 21
attacked 0 230 21
from 0 230 21
the 0 230 21
front, 0 230 21
sending 0 230 21
the 0 230 21
Roman 0 230 21
pagans, 0 230 21
French 0 230 21
Revolutionaries, 0 230 21
and 0 230 21
British 0 230 21
American 0 230 21
secularists. 0 230 21

They 0 230 22
flank 0 230 22
us 0 230 22
by 0 230 22
sending 0 230 22
heretics 0 230 22
like 0 230 22
Arius, 0 230 22
Luther, 0 230 22
and 0 230 22
Hans 0 230 22
Kung. 0 230 22

Today, 0 230 23
there’s 0 230 23
also 0 230 23
a 0 230 23
fifth 0 230 23
column 0 230 23
working 0 230 23
to 0 230 23
tear 0 230 23
down 0 230 23
the 0 230 23
walls 0 230 23
from 0 230 23
within 0 230 23
– 0 230 23
not 0 230 23
only 0 230 23
pedophiles 0 230 23
like 0 230 23
John 0 230 23
Geoghan, 0 230 23
but 0 230 23
also 0 230 23
predators 1 230 23
like 0 230 23
Theodore 0 230 23
McCarrick. 0 230 23

Where 0 230 24
did 0 230 24
those 0 230 24
fifth 0 230 24
columnists 0 230 24
enter? 0 230 24

Why, 0 230 25
there’s 1 230 25
only 1 230 25
one 1 230 25
possible 1 230 25
explanation: 1 230 25
the 0 230 25
Second 0 230 25
Vatican 0 230 25
Council. 0 230 25

Aggiornamento 0 230 26
sounds 0 230 26
like 0 230 26
a 0 230 26
Lefebvrist 0 230 26
slur. 0 230 26

The 0 230 27
idea 0 230 27
that 0 230 27
an 0 230 27
ecumenical 0 230 27
council 0 230 27
of 0 230 27
the 0 230 27
Catholic 0 230 27
Church 0 230 27
would 0 230 27
openly 0 230 27
seek 0 230 27
to 0 230 27
“bring 0 230 27
itself 0 230 27
up 0 230 27
to 0 230 27
date” 0 230 27
is 0 230 27
ridiculous. 0 230 27

Yet 0 230 28
that 0 230 28
was 0 230 28
precisely 0 230 28
the 0 230 28
aim. 0 230 28

As 0 230 29
St 0 230 29
Pope 0 230 29
John 0 230 29
XXIII 0 230 29
explained, 0 230 29
“Its 0 230 29
principal 0 230 29
task 0 230 29
will 0 230 29
be 0 230 29
concerned 0 230 29
with 0 230 29
the 0 230 29
conditions 0 230 29
and 0 230 29
modernization 0 230 29
of 0 230 29
the 0 230 29
Church 0 230 29
after 0 230 29
20 0 230 29
centuries 0 230 29
of 0 230 29
life.” 0 230 29
It 0 230 29
was 0 230 29
not 0 230 29
supposed 0 230 29
(as 0 230 29
some 0 230 29
have 0 230 29
claimed) 0 230 29
to 0 230 29
simply 0 230 29
update 0 230 29
the 0 230 29
liturgy 0 230 29
from 0 230 29
its 0 230 29
last 0 230 29
redesign 0 230 29
in 0 230 29
1570. 0 230 29

The 0 230 30
goal 0 230 30
was 0 230 30
to 0 230 30
align 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
Church 0 230 30
more 0 230 30
with 0 230 30
modern 0 230 30
world: 0 230 30
a 0 230 30
world 0 230 30
defined, 0 230 30
to 0 230 30
a 0 230 30
considerable 0 230 30
extent, 0 230 30
by 0 230 30
its 0 230 30
rejection 0 230 30
of 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
Catholic 0 230 30
world 0 230 30
that 0 230 30
flourished 0 230 30
before 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
Protestant 0 230 30
Reformation 0 230 30
and 0 230 30
French 0 230 30
Revolution. 0 230 30

Now, 0 230 31
I 0 230 31
don’t 0 230 31
believe 0 230 31
Pope 0 230 31
John 0 230 31
saw 0 230 31
himself 0 230 31
as 0 230 31
endangering 0 230 31
either 0 230 31
orthodoxy 0 230 31
or 0 230 31
sacred, 0 230 31
immutable 0 230 31
tradition. 0 230 31

I 0 230 32
share 0 230 32
Pope 0 230 32
Paul 0 230 32
IV’s 0 230 32
view. 0 230 32

When 0 230 33
he 0 230 33
heard 0 230 33
that 0 230 33
the 0 230 33
Council 0 230 33
was 0 230 33
being 0 230 33
convened, 0 230 33
then-Cardinal 0 230 33
Montini 0 230 33
is 0 230 33
supposed 0 230 33
to 0 230 33
have 0 230 33
sighed, 0 230 33
“This 0 230 33
holy 1 230 33
old 1 230 33
boy 1 230 33
doesn’t 0 230 33
realise 0 230 33
what 0 230 33
a 0 230 33
hornet’s 0 230 33
nest 0 230 33
he’s 0 230 33
stirring 0 230 33
up.” 0 230 33

Nonetheless, 0 230 34
he 0 230 34
stirred 0 230 34
it. 0 230 34

The 0 230 35
spirit 0 230 35
of 0 230 35
aggiornamento 0 230 35
quickly 0 230 35
spread 0 230 35
through 0 230 35
the 0 230 35
Church 0 230 35
in 0 230 35
the 0 230 35
1960s 0 230 35
– 0 230 35
and 0 230 35
the 0 230 35
seminaries 0 230 35
especially. 0 230 35

Seminarians 0 230 36
called 0 230 36
for 0 230 36
a 0 230 36
more 0 230 36
“participatory” 0 230 36
administration. 0 230 36

They 0 230 37
became 0 230 37
involved 0 230 37
in 0 230 37
socialist 0 230 37
politics. 0 230 37

They 0 230 38
formed 0 230 38
trade 0 230 38
unions 0 230 38
to 0 230 38
demand 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
right 0 230 38
to 0 230 38
marry. 0 230 38

They 0 230 39
practiced 0 230 39
sauvage 0 230 39
intercommunion. 0 230 39

Of 0 230 40
course, 0 230 40
they 0 230 40
had 0 230 40
their 0 230 40
enablers 0 230 40
in 0 230 40
the 0 230 40
hierarchy 0 230 40
as 0 230 40
well. 0 230 40

Perhaps 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
worst 0 230 41
was 0 230 41
Archbishop 0 230 41
Marty 0 230 41
of 0 230 41
Paris, 0 230 41
a 0 230 41
leader 0 230 41
of 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
“priest-worker 0 230 41
movement” 0 230 41
who 0 230 41
defended 0 230 41
Marxist 0 230 41
and 0 230 41
existentialist 0 230 41
atheisms 0 230 41
on 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
floor 0 230 41
of 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
Council. 0 230 41

During 0 230 42
a 0 230 42
homily 0 230 42
at 0 230 42
the 0 230 42
Cathedral, 0 230 42
he 0 230 42
also 0 230 42
praised 0 230 42
the 0 230 42
soixantehuitards: 0 230 42
“the 0 230 42
great 0 230 42
outburst 0 230 42
of 0 230 42
the 0 230 42
younger 0 230 42
generation 0 230 42
that 0 230 42
suddenly 0 230 42
wanted 0 230 42
to 0 230 42
take 0 230 42
its 0 230 42
place 0 230 42
in 0 230 42
life” 0 230 42
that 0 230 42
occurred 0 230 42
in 0 230 42
his 0 230 42
city 0 230 42
in 0 230 42
May 0 230 42
of 0 230 42
1968. 0 230 42

“One 0 230 43
also 0 230 43
felt 0 230 43
that, 0 230 43
in 0 230 43
these 0 230 43
events 0 230 43
of 0 230 43
May,” 0 230 43
Marty 0 230 43
continued, 0 230 43
“the 0 230 43
seriousness 0 230 43
of 0 230 43
the 0 230 43
working 0 230 43
class, 0 230 43
which 0 230 43
wants 0 230 43
not 0 230 43
only 0 230 43
to 0 230 43
earn 0 230 43
a 0 230 43
living 0 230 43
wage, 0 230 43
but 0 230 43
also 0 230 43
to 0 230 43
find 0 230 43
its 0 230 43
freedom, 0 230 43
its 0 230 43
independence.” 0 230 43
Theaggiornamentistas 0 230 43
was 0 230 43
never 0 230 43
purged 0 230 43
from 0 230 43
the 0 230 43
Church, 0 230 43
and 0 230 43
certainly 0 230 43
not 0 230 43
from 0 230 43
the 0 230 43
seminaries. 0 230 43

As 0 230 44
the 0 230 44
modern 0 230 44
world 0 230 44
continued 0 230 44
to 0 230 44
reject 0 230 44
traditional 0 230 44
Christian 0 230 44
mores, 0 230 44
so 0 230 44
too 0 230 44
does 0 230 44
the 0 230 44
Church 0 230 44
seem 0 230 44
increasingly 0 230 44
“out 0 230 44
of 0 230 44
step” 0 230 44
and 0 230 44
in 0 230 44
need 0 230 44
of 0 230 44
“modernizing”. 0 230 44

Inevitably, 0 230 45
this 0 230 45
came 0 230 45
to 0 230 45
mean 0 230 45
the 0 230 45
acceptance 0 230 45
of 0 230 45
homosexuality. 0 230 45

Bishop 0 230 46
Wilton 0 230 46
D. 0 230 46
Gregory, 0 230 46
as 0 230 46
president 0 230 46
of 0 230 46
the 0 230 46
U.S. 0 230 46
Conference 0 230 46
of 0 230 46
Catholic 0 230 46
Bishops, 0 230 46
infamously 0 230 46
spoke 0 230 46
of 0 230 46
“an 0 230 46
ongoing 0 230 46
struggle 0 230 46
to 0 230 46
make 0 230 46
sure 0 230 46
that 0 230 46
the 0 230 46
Catholic 0 230 46
priesthood 0 230 46
is 0 230 46
not 0 230 46
dominated 0 230 46
by 0 230 46
homosexual 0 230 46
men.” 0 230 46

But 0 230 47
that 0 230 47
predominance 0 230 47
has 0 230 47
very 0 230 47
little 0 230 47
to 0 230 47
do 0 230 47
with 0 230 47
homosexuality 0 230 47
per 0 230 47
se. 0 230 47

Rather, 0 230 48
the 0 230 48
1960s 0 230 48
rejection 0 230 48
of 0 230 48
celibacy 0 230 48
in 0 230 48
the 0 230 48
seminaries 0 230 48
naturally 0 230 48
provided 0 230 48
more 0 230 48
(shall 0 230 48
we 0 230 48
say) 0 230 48
opportunities 0 230 48
for 0 230 48
gay 0 230 48
men 0 230 48
– 0 230 48
given 0 230 48
that 0 230 48
there 0 230 48
are, 0 230 48
of 0 230 48
course, 0 230 48
no 0 230 48
women 0 230 48
in 0 230 48
Catholic 0 230 48
seminaries. 0 230 48

This 0 230 49
began 0 230 49
driving 0 230 49
away 0 230 49
heterosexuals, 0 230 49
as 0 230 49
well 0 230 49
as 0 230 49
homosexuals 0 230 49
who 0 230 49
upheld 0 230 49
the 0 230 49
Church’s 0 230 49
teachings 0 230 49
on 0 230 49
chastity 0 230 49
and 0 230 49
celibacy. 0 230 49

Needless 0 230 50
to 0 230 50
say, 0 230 50
not 0 230 50
all 0 230 50
gay 0 230 50
priests 0 230 50
are 0 230 50
violent 1 230 50
predators 1 230 50
like 0 230 50
McCarrick. 0 230 50

But 0 230 51
the 0 230 51
toleration 0 230 51
of 0 230 51
sexually 0 230 51
active 0 230 51
priests 0 230 51
gave 0 230 51
McCarrick 0 230 51
cover 0 230 51
to 0 230 51
“seduce” 0 230 51
his 0 230 51
victims. 0 230 51

Many 0 230 52
have 0 230 52
also 0 230 52
speculated 0 230 52
that, 0 230 52
because 0 230 52
McCarrick’s 0 230 52
victims 0 230 52
were 0 230 52
overwhelmingly 0 230 52
above 0 230 52
the 0 230 52
age 0 230 52
of 0 230 52
consent, 0 230 52
the 0 230 52
media 0 230 52
didn’t 0 230 52
consider 0 230 52
them 0 230 52
newsworthy. 0 230 52

If 0 230 53
he’d 0 230 53
fondled 0 230 53
a 0 230 53
12-year 0 230 53
old 0 230 53
altar 0 230 53
boy, 0 230 53
that 0 230 53
would 0 230 53
have 0 230 53
been 0 230 53
one 0 230 53
thing. 0 230 53

Pedophile 1 230 54
priests 1 230 54
sell 1 230 54
papers. 1 230 54

But 0 230 55
taking 0 230 55
an 0 230 55
18-year-old 0 230 55
seminarian 0 230 55
to 0 230 55
bed? 0 230 55

Running 0 230 56
that 0 230 56
story 0 230 56
would 0 230 56
simply 0 230 56
be 0 230 56
outing 0 230 56
a 0 230 56
closeted 1 230 56
gay 1 230 56
man: 1 230 56
an 0 230 56
act 0 230 56
the 0 230 56
liberal 0 230 56
press 0 230 56
would 0 230 56
no 0 230 56
doubt 0 230 56
consider 0 230 56
“homophobic”, 0 230 56
as 0 230 56
Ross 0 230 56
Douthat 0 230 56
pointed 0 230 56
out. 0 230 56

Meanwhile, 0 230 57
those 0 230 57
bishops 0 230 57
who 0 230 57
didn’t 0 230 57
approve 0 230 57
of 0 230 57
his 0 230 57
actions 0 230 57
knew 0 230 57
the 0 230 57
culture 0 230 57
– 0 230 57
both 0 230 57
within 0 230 57
the 0 230 57
Church 0 230 57
and 0 230 57
without 0 230 57
her 0 230 57
– 0 230 57
were 0 230 57
against 0 230 57
them. 0 230 57

The 0 230 58
post-Vatican 0 230 58
Church 0 230 58
doesn’t 0 230 58
like 0 230 58
to 0 230 58
come 0 230 58
off 0 230 58
as 0 230 58
a 0 230 58
nag. 0 230 58

She’s 0 230 59
not 0 230 59
going 0 230 59
to 0 230 59
cause 0 230 59
a 0 230 59
fuss 0 230 59
by 0 230 59
purging 0 230 59
sexually 0 230 59
active 0 230 59
gay 0 230 59
men 0 230 59
from 0 230 59
the 0 230 59
clergy 0 230 59
just 0 230 59
because… 0 230 59
what? 0 230 59

It’s 0 230 60
immoral? 0 230 60

That’s 0 230 61
not 0 230 61
very 0 230 61
aggiornamentistic! 0 230 61

The 0 230 62
world 0 230 62
and 0 230 62
our 0 230 62
worldly 0 230 62
bishops 0 230 62
were, 0 230 62
unsurprisingly, 0 230 62
of 0 230 62
one 0 230 62
mind. 0 230 62

And 0 230 63
even 0 230 63
if 0 230 63
they 0 230 63
were 0 230 63
disgusted 0 230 63
by 0 230 63
McCarrick, 0 230 63
these 0 230 63
prelates 0 230 63
weren’t 0 230 63
willing 0 230 63
to 0 230 63
jeopardize 0 230 63
their 0 230 63
careers 0 230 63
by 0 230 63
standing 0 230 63
for 0 230 63
justice 0 230 63
against 0 230 63
vice. 0 230 63

We 0 230 64
seem 0 230 64
to 0 230 64
be 0 230 64
slouching 0 230 64
back 0 230 64
to 0 230 64
the 0 230 64
old 0 230 64
traditionalist 0 230 64
trope: 0 230 64
All 0 230 64
the 0 230 64
Church’s 0 230 64
problems 0 230 64
would 0 230 64
be 0 230 64
solved 0 230 64
if 0 230 64
we’d 0 230 64
just 0 230 64
go 0 230 64
back 0 230 64
to 0 230 64
the 0 230 64
Latin 0 230 64
Mass. 0 230 64

Something 0 230 65
went 0 230 65
critically 1 230 65
wrong 1 230 65
during 0 230 65
Vatican 0 230 65
II 0 230 65
that 0 230 65
extends 0 230 65
well 0 230 65
beyond 0 230 65
the 0 230 65
Mass. 0 230 65

And 0 230 66
we 0 230 66
can’t 0 230 66
drag 0 230 66
the 0 230 66
Church 0 230 66
out 0 230 66
of 0 230 66
her 0 230 66
present 0 230 66
crisis 0 230 66
until 0 230 66
we 0 230 66
have 0 230 66
the 0 230 66
courage 0 230 66
to 0 230 66
brave 0 230 66
accusations 0 230 66
of 0 230 66
“Lefebvrism” 0 230 66
and 0 230 66
say 0 230 66
so. 0 230 66

Those 0 230 67
who 0 230 67
love 0 230 67
our 0 230 67
Holy 0 230 67
Mother 0 230 67
– 0 230 67
those 0 230 67
who 0 230 67
want 0 230 67
to 0 230 67
protect 0 230 67
her 0 230 67
boys 0 230 67
and 0 230 67
men 0 230 67
from 0 230 67
all 0 230 67
the 0 230 67
McCarricks 0 230 67
and 0 230 67
their 0 230 67
perverse 1 230 67
appetites 0 230 67
– 0 230 67
mustn’t 0 230 67
be 0 230 67
deceived 0 230 67
into 0 230 67
thinking 0 230 67
this 0 230 67
is 0 230 67
a 0 230 67
small 0 230 67
or 0 230 67
an 0 230 67
isolated 0 230 67
issue. 0 230 67

It 0 230 68
isn’t. 0 230 68

This 0 230 69
is 0 230 69
the 0 230 69
crisis 0 230 69
of 0 230 69
an 0 230 69
ancient 0 230 69
and 0 230 69
immortal 0 230 69
institution 0 230 69
trying 0 230 69
desperately 0 230 69
to 0 230 69
seem 0 230 69
young 0 230 69
and 0 230 69
fashionable; 0 230 69
like 0 230 69
all 0 230 69
old 0 230 69
men, 0 230 69
it 0 230 69
only 0 230 69
manages 0 230 69
to 0 230 69
come 0 230 69
across 0 230 69
as 0 230 69
lecherous 1 230 69
and 1 230 69
pathetic. 1 230 69

Its 0 230 70
obsession 0 230 70
with 0 230 70
“modernization” 0 230 70
leads 0 230 70
it 0 230 70
to 0 230 70
only 0 230 70
adopt 0 230 70
the 0 230 70
vices 0 230 70
of 0 230 70
modernity. 0 230 70

Instead 0 230 71
of 0 230 71
serving 0 230 71
as 0 230 71
ambassadors 0 230 71
from 0 230 71
the 0 230 71
City 0 230 71
of 0 230 71
God, 0 230 71
far 0 230 71
too 0 230 71
many 0 230 71
of 0 230 71
our 0 230 71
priests 0 230 71
and 0 230 71
prelates 0 230 71
have 0 230 71
become 0 230 71
agents 0 230 71
of 0 230 71
the 0 230 71
City 0 230 71
of 0 230 71
Man. 0 230 71

I 0 230 72
don’t 0 230 72
know 0 230 72
what 0 230 72
it 0 230 72
will 0 230 72
take 0 230 72
to 0 230 72

things 0 230 72
right. 0 230 72

I 1 230 73
don’t 1 230 73
know 1 230 73
what 1 230 73
it 1 230 73
will 1 230 73

So, 0 231 12
is 0 231 12
the 0 231 12
Ebola 0 231 12
virus 0 231 12
reaching 0 231 12
a 0 231 12
terrifying 1 231 12
enough 0 231 12
level 0 231 12
that 0 231 12
an 0 231 12
experimental 0 231 12
vaccine 0 231 12
is 0 231 12
warranted? 0 231 12

The 0 231 13
death 0 231 13
toll 0 231 13
has 0 231 13
reached 0 231 13
26 0 231 13
and 0 231 13
the 0 231 13
vaccine 0 231 13
will 0 231 13
be 0 231 13
rolled 0 231 13
out 0 231 13
at 0 231 13
Mbandaka, 0 231 13
the 0 231 13
north-western 0 231 13
city 0 231 13

1.2 0 231 13
million 0 231 13
recently 0 231 13
struck 0 231 13
by 0 231 13
the 0 231 13
outbreak. 0 231 13

Since 0 231 14
the 0 231 14
virus 0 231 14
is 0 231 14
spread 0 231 14
through 0 231 14
direct 0 231 14
contact, 0 231 14
an 0 231 14
isn’t 0 231 14
airborne, 0 231 14
it 0 231 14
isn’t 0 231 14
nearly 0 231 14
as 0 231 14
deadly 0 231 14
as 0 231 14
it 0 231 14
could 0 231 14
be. 0 231 14

Ebola 0 231 15
and 0 231 15
how 0 231 15
it 0 231 15
is 0 231 15
transmitted: 0 231 15

Initially, 0 231 16
the 0 231 16
campaign 0 231 16
will 0 231 16
target 0 231 16
600 0 231 16

medical 0 231 16
staff, 0 231 16

with 0 231 16
the 0 231 16

Officials 0 231 17
are 0 231 17
working 0 231 17
urgently 0 231 17
to 0 231 17
prevent 0 231 17
the 0 231 17
disease 0 231 17
from 0 231 17
spreading 0 231 17
beyond 0 231 17
Mbandaka, 0 231 17
which 0 231 17
lies 0 231 17
on 0 231 17
the 0 231 17
Congo 0 231 17
River, 0 231 17
a 0 231 17
busy 0 231 17
traffic 0 231 17
corridor, 0 231 17
and 0 231 17
is 0 231 17
an 0 231 17
hour’s 0 231 17
flight 0 231 17
from 0 231 17
the 0 231 17
capital. 0 231 17

The 0 231 18
spread 0 231 18
of 0 231 18
Ebola 0 231 18
from 0 231 18
a 0 231 18
rural 0 231 18
area 0 231 18
to 0 231 18
Mbandaka 0 231 18
has 0 231 18
raised 0 231 18
alarm 1 231 18
as 1 231 18
Ebola 1 231 18
can 1 231 18
spread 1 231 18
more 1 231 18
quickly 1 231 18
in 1 231 18
urban 1 231 18
centers. 1 231 18

The 0 231 19
fever 0 231 19
can 0 231 19
cause 0 231 19
severe 0 231 19
internal 0 231 19
bleeding 0 231 19
that 0 231 19
is 0 231 19
often 0 231 19
fatal. 0 231 19

Meaning, 0 231 20
the 0 231 20
virus 0 231 20
itself 0 231 20
doesn’t 0 231 20
actually 0 231 20
kill. 0 231 20

The 0 231 21
immune 0 231 21
system’s 0 231 21
response 0 231 21
to 0 231 21
the 0 231 21
virus 0 231 21
is 0 231 21
what’s 0 231 21
deadly. 0 231 21

ZMapp 0 231 22
is 0 231 22
also 0 231 22
an 0 231 22
experimental 0 231 22
drug 0 231 22
that 0 231 22
could 0 231 22
aid 0 231 22
in 0 231 22
the 0 231 22
recovery 0 231 22
from 0 231 22
the 0 231 22
Ebola 0 231 22
virus. 0 231 22

But, 0 231 23
like 0 231 23
the 0 231 23
vaccine 0 231 23
being 0 231 23
administered, 0 231 23
it 0 231 23
has 0 231 23
not 0 231 23
been 0 231 23
tested 0 231 23
for 0 231 23
safety 0 231 23
or 0 231 23
efficacy 0 231 23
yet. 0 231 23

It 0 231 24
is 0 231 24
not 0 231 24
a 0 231 24
vaccine 0 231 24
– 0 231 24
it 0 231 24
is 0 231 24
a 0 231 24
therapeutic 0 231 24
drug. 0 231 24

Of 0 231 25
the 0 231 25
seven 0 231 25
people 0 231 25
given 0 231 25
the 0 231 25
drug 0 231 25
so 0 231 25
far, 0 231 25
two 0 231 25
have 0 231 25
died. 0 231 25

ZMapp 0 231 26
show 0 231 26
“promise,” 0 231 26
although 0 231 26
scientific 0 231 26
results 0 231 26
are 0 231 26
not 0 231 26
definitive. 0 231 26

The 0 231 27
risk 0 231 27
of 0 231 27
Ebola 0 231 27
spreading 0 231 27
within 0 231 27
Congo 0 231 27
is 0 231 27
“very 1 231 27
high,” 1 231 27
according 0 231 27
to 0 231 27
authorities, 0 231 27
and 0 231 27
the 1 231 27
disease 1 231 27
could 1 231 27
also 1 231 27
move 1 231 27
into 1 231 27
nine 1 231 27
neighboring 1 231 27
countries, 1 231 27
the 0 231 27
World 0 231 27
Health 0 231 27
Organization 0 231 27
has 0 231 27
warned. 0 231 27

The 0 231 28
WHO, 0 231 28
however, 0 231 28
stopped 0 231 28
short 0 231 28
of 0 231 28
declaring 0 231 28
the 0 231 28
outbreak 0 231 28
a 0 231 28
global 0 231 28
health 0 231 28
emergency. 0 231 28

WHO 0 231 29
said 0 231 29
there 0 231 29
should 0 231 29
not 0 231 29
be 0 231 29
restrictions 0 231 29
on 0 231 29
international 0 231 29
travel 0 231 29
or 0 231 29
trade. 0 231 29

In 0 231 30
the 0 231 30
meantime, 0 231 30
it’s 0 231 30
important 0 231 30
to 0 231 30
prevent 0 231 30
oneself 0 231 30
from 0 231 30
contracting 0 231 30
the 0 231 30
virus. 0 231 30

Unfortunately, 0 231 31
health 0 231 31
care 0 231 31
workers 0 231 31
are 0 231 31
at 0 231 31
the 0 231 31
greatest 0 231 31
risk 0 231 31
as 0 231 31
they 0 231 31
try 0 231 31
to 0 231 31
cull 0 231 31
the 0 231 31
suffering: 0 231 31
which 0 231 31
is 0 231 31
why 0 231 31
they 0 231 31
will 0 231 31
be 0 231 31
the 0 231 31
first 0 231 31
to 0 231 31
get 0 231 31
the 0 231 31
experimental 0 231 31
vaccine. 0 231 31

For 0 231 32
their 0 231 32
sake, 0 231 32
let’s 0 231 32
hope 0 231 32
it 0 231 32
works 0 231 32
better 0 231 32
than 0 231 32
this 1 231 32
year’s 1 231 32
flu 1 231 32
vaccine. 1 231 32

West 0 234 0

Islam 0 234 0

British 0 234 1
politician 0 234 1
Nigel 0 234 1
Farage 0 234 1
once 0 234 1
helped 0 234 1
convince 0 234 1
Britons 0 234 1
to 0 234 1
vote 0 234 1
for 0 234 1
Brexit 0 234 1
and 0 234 1
separate 0 234 1
from 0 234 1
the 0 234 1
European 0 234 1
Union, 0 234 1
but 1 234 1
British 1 234 1
establishment 1 234 1
politicians 1 234 1
have 1 234 1
done 1 234 1
everything 1 234 1
they 1 234 1
could 1 234 1
to 1 234 1
sabotage 1 234 1
that 1 234 1
vote 1 234 1
since 1 234 1
then. 1 234 1

Now 0 234 2
Farage 0 234 2
has 0 234 2
apparently 0 234 2
decided 0 234 2
that 0 234 2
if 1 234 2
he 1 234 2
can’t 1 234 2
beat 1 234 2
them, 1 234 2
he’ll 1 234 2
join 1 234 2
them 1 234 2
— 0 234 2
if 0 234 2
not 0 234 2
on 0 234 2
Brexit, 0 234 2
then 0 234 2
in 0 234 2
their 0 234 2
stance 1 234 2
of 1 234 2
denial 1 234 2
and 1 234 2
appeasement 1 234 2
regarding 0 234 2
the 1 234 2
global 1 234 2
jihad 1 234 2
threat.’ 1 234 2

At 0 234 3
a 0 234 3
recent 0 234 3
dinner 0 234 3
of 0 234 3
the 0 234 3
UK 0 234 3
Independence 0 234 3
Party 0 234 3
(UKIP), 0 234 3
which 0 234 3
he 0 234 3
formerly 0 234 3
headed, 0 234 3
Farage 0 234 3
said: 0 234 3
“If 1 234 3
dealing 1 234 3
with 1 234 3
Islamic 1 234 3
fundamentalism 1 234 3
becomes 1 234 3
a 1 234 3
battle 1 234 3
between 1 234 3
us 1 234 3
and 1 234 3
the 1 234 3
entire 1 234 3
religion, 1 234 3
I’ll 1 234 3
tell 1 234 3
you 1 234 3
the 1 234 3
result: 1 234 3
we’ll 1 234 3
lose. 1 234 3

We 1 234 4
will 1 234 4
simply 1 234 4
lose….We 1 234 4
absolutely 1 234 4
have 1 234 4
to 1 234 4
get 1 234 4
that 1 234 4
Muslim 1 234 4
majority 1 234 4

in 1 234 4
many 1 234 4
of 1 234 4

towns 1 234 4
and 1 234 4
cities 1 234 4
on 1 234 4
our 1 234 4
side, 1 234 4
more 1 234 4
attuned 1 234 4
to 1 234 4
Western 1 234 4
values 1 234 4
than 1 234 4
some 1 234 4
pretty 1 234 4
hardline 1 234 4
interpretations 1 234 4
of 1 234 4
the 1 234 4
Qur’an.” 1 234 4

Sure. 1 234 5

Now 0 234 6
how 0 234 6
does 0 234 6
Farage 0 234 6
propose 0 234 6
to 0 234 6
do 0 234 6
that? 0 234 6

His 0 234 7
warning 0 234 7
against 0 234 7
making 0 234 7
the 0 234 7
resistance 0 234 7

us 1 234 7
and 1 234 7
the 1 234 7
entire 1 234 7
religion” 1 234 7
is 0 234 7
odd. 0 234 7

No 1 234 8
sane 1 234 8
person 1 234 8
is 1 234 8
saying 1 234 8
that 1 234 8
the 1 234 8
West 1 234 8
should 1 234 8
go 1 234 8

The 0 234 9
likeliest 0 234 9
interpretation 0 234 9
of 0 234 9
his 0 234 9

But 1 234 20
if 1 234 20
we 1 234 20
don’t 1 234 20
speak 1 234 20
about 1 234 20
such 1 234 20
facts, 1 234 20
how 1 234 20
will 1 234 20
we 1 234 20
ever 1 234 20
convince 1 234 20
Muslims 1 234 20
not 1 234 20
to 1 234 20

“hardline 1 234 20
interpretations 1 234 20
of 1 234 20
the 1 234 20
Qur’an”? 1 234 20

Another 1 234 21
problem 1 234 21
with 1 234 21
Farage’s 1 234 21
statement 1 234 21
is 1 234 21
that 1 234 21
it 1 234 21
manifests 1 234 21
a 1 234 21
remarkable 1 234 21
ignorance 1 234 21
of 1 234 21
history. 1 234 21

While 1 234 22
he 1 234 22
is 1 234 22
deeply 1 234 22
concerned 1 234 22
that 1 234 22
British 1 234 22
people 1 234 22
not 1 234 22
begin 1 234 22
to 1 234 22
think 1 234 22
that 1 234 22
resisting 1 234 22
jihad 1 234 22
terror 1 234 22
means 1 234 22
that 1 234 22
they 1 234 22
are 1 234 22
in 1 234 22
a 1 234 22
“battle” 1 234 22
with 1 234 22
the 1 234 22
“entire 1 234 22
religion” 1 234 22
of 1 234 22
Islam, 1 234 22
he 1 234 22
appears 1 234 22
unaware 1 234 22
of 1 234 22
the 1 234 22
fact 1 234 22
that 1 234 22
many 1 234 22
Muslims 1 234 22
throughout 1 234 22
history 1 234 22
have 1 234 22
considered 1 234 22
their 1 234 22

to 1 234 22

fifteenth-century 1 234 24

who 1 234 24
wrote 1 234 24
a 1 234 24
biography 1 234 24
of 1 234 24
the 1 234 24
Mongol 1 234 24
Muslim 1 234 24
warrior 1 234 24
Tamerlane, 1 234 24

of 1 234 24

Muhammad 1 234 25
advises 1 234 25
the 1 234 25
same 1 234 25
thing, 1 234 25
according 1 234 25
to 1 234 25
the 1 234 25
tradition 1 234 25
of 1 234 25
the 1 234 25

doctors: 1 234 25
wherefore 0 234 25
the 0 234 25

always 0 234 25
strove 0 234 25
to 1 234 25
exterminate 1 234 25
the 1 234 25
infidels, 1 234 25
as 0 234 25
much 0 234 25
to 0 234 25
acquire 0 234 25
that 0 234 25
glory, 0 234 25
as 0 234 25
to 0 234 25
signalise 0 234 25
himself 0 234 25
by 0 234 25
the 0 234 25
greatness 0 234 25
of 0 234 25
his 0 234 25
conquests.” 0 234 25

After 0 234 26
conquest 0 234 26
came 0 234 26
dhimmitude, 0 234 26
the 0 234 26
subjugated 0 234 26
status 0 234 26
that 0 234 26
the 0 234 26

(primarily 0 234 26

considered 1 234 28
an 1 234 28
act 1 234 28
of 1 234 28
piety; 1 234 28

not 1 234 28

It 1 234 29
must 1 234 29
be 1 234 29
exacted 1 234 29
from 1 234 29
him 1 234 29
directly 1 234 29
in 1 234 29

and 1 234 29
humiliate 1 234 29
him, 1 234 29
so 1 234 29
that 1 234 29
Islam 1 234 29
and 1 234 29
its 1 234 29
people 1 234 29
may 1 234 29
be 1 234 29

and 1 234 29
the 1 234 29
race 1 234 29
of 1 234 29
infidels 1 234 29
brought 1 234 29
low. 1 234 29

The 1 234 30
jizya 1 234 30
is 1 234 30
to 1 234 30
be 1 234 30
imposed 1 234 30
on 1 234 30
all 1 234 30
of 1 234 30
them 1 234 30
in 1 234 30
full, 1 234 30
without 1 234 30
exception. 1 234 30

Underlying 0 234 31
this 0 234 31
subjugation 0 234 31
is 0 234 31
a 0 234 31
deep 0 234 31
contempt 0 234 31
for 0 234 31
non-Muslims. 0 234 31

In 0 234 32
the 0 234 32
year 0 234 32
718, 0 234 32
the 1 234 32

caliph 1 234 32
Umar 1 234 32
ibn 1 234 32
Abd 1 234 32

sent 1 234 32
out 1 234 32
a 1 234 32
message 1 234 32
to 1 234 32
the 1 234 32
governors 1 234 32
of 1 234 32
the 1 234 32

provinces: 1 234 32

O 1 234 33
you 1 234 33
who 1 234 33
believe! 1 234 33

The 1 234 34
non-Muslims 1 234 34
are 1 234 34
nothing 1 234 34
but 1 234 34
dirt. 1 234 34

Allah 1 234 35
has 1 234 35
created 1 234 35
them 1 234 35
to 1 234 35
be 1 234 35
partisans 1 234 35
of 1 234 35
Satan; 1 234 35
most 1 234 35
treacherous 1 234 35
in 1 234 35
regard 1 234 35
to 1 234 35
all 1 234 35
they 1 234 35
do; 1 234 35
whose 1 234 35
whole 1 234 35
endeavor 1 234 35
in 1 234 35
this 1 234 35
nether 1 234 35
life 1 234 35
is 1 234 35
useless, 1 234 35
though 1 234 35
they 1 234 35
themselves 1 234 35
imagine 1 234 35
that 1 234 35
they 1 234 35
are 1 234 35
doing 1 234 35
fine 1 234 35
work. 1 234 35

Upon 1 234 36
them 1 234 36
rests 1 234 36
the 1 234 36
curse 1 234 36
of 1 234 36
Allah, 1 234 36
of 1 234 36

Angels 1 234 36
and 1 234 36
of 1 234 36
man 1 234 36
collectively 1 234 36

We 0 234 37
must 0 234 37
not 0 234 37
think 0 234 37
that 0 234 37
we 0 234 37
are 0 234 37
at 1 234 37
war 1 234 37
with 1 234 37
the 1 234 37

But 1 234 38
what, 1 234 38
Mr. 1 234 38
Farage, 1 234 38
are 1 234 38
we 1 234 38
to 1 234 38
think 1 234 38
about 1 234 38
the 1 234 38
Muslims 1 234 38
who 1 234 38
consider 1 234 38
themselves 1 234 38
and 1 234 38
their 1 234 38
religion 1 234 38
to 1 234 38
be 1 234 38
at 1 234 38

us? 1 234 38

“While 0 238 9

the 1 249 6

of 1 249 6

say 0 249 6
they 0 249 6
have 0 249 6
no 0 249 6

the 0 249 9

As 0 250 5
Miller 0 250 5
documented, 0 250 5
this 0 250 5
official 0 250 5
— 0 250 5
whom 0 250 5
the 0 250 5
paper 0 250 5
did 0 250 5
not 0 250 5
name 0 250 5
because 0 250 5
she 0 250 5
was 0 250 5
a 0 250 5
covert 0 250 5
agent 0 250 5
at 0 250 5
the 0 250 5

— 0 250 5
was 0 250 5
centrally 0 250 5

in 0 250 5
the 1 250 5
worst 1 250 5
abuses 1 250 5
of 1 250 5
the 1 250 5
CIA’s 1 250 5
Bush-era 1 250 5
torture 1 250 5
regime. 1 250 5

As 0 250 6
Miller 0 250 6
put 0 250 6
it, 0 250 6
she 0 250 6
was 0 250 6
“directly 0 250 6
involved 0 250 6

in 0 250 6
torturing 0 250 6

Even 0 250 7
more 0 250 7
troubling, 0 250 7
she 0 250 7
“had 0 250 7

Beyond 0 250 8
all 0 250 8
that, 0 250 8
she 0 250 8
played 0 250 8
a 0 250 8

who 0 251 46
later 0 251 46
in 0 251 46
the 0 251 46
Senate 0 251 46
led 0 251 46
the 0 251 46
way 0 251 46
to 0 251 46
a 0 251 46
supply-side 0 251 46
policy, 0 251 46
were, 0 251 46
at 0 251 46
this 0 251 46
time, 0 251 46
opposed 0 251 46
(see 0 251 46

The 0 251 47
Democrats 0 251 47
claimed 0 251 47
that 0 251 47
the 0 251 47
policy 0 251 47
would 0 251 47
worsen 0 251 47
the 0 251 47
budget 0 251 47
deficit, 0 251 47
the 0 251 47
only 0 251 47
time 0 251 47
in 0 251 47
those 0 251 47
days 0 251 47
Democrats 0 251 47
cared 0 251 47
about 0 251 47
the 0 251 47
budget 0 251 47
deficit. 0 251 47

The 0 251 48
Democrats 0 251 48
said 0 251 48
that 0 251 48
they 0 251 48
would 0 251 48
support 0 251 48
the 0 251 48
tax 0 251 48
rate 0 251 48
reductions 0 251 48
if 0 251 48
the 0 251 48
Republicans 0 251 48
would 0 251 48
support 0 251 48
offsetting 0 251 48
cuts 0 251 48
in 0 251 48
the 0 251 48
budget 0 251 48
to 0 251 48
support 0 251 48
a 0 251 48
balanced 0 251 48
budget. 0 251 48

This 0 251 49
was 0 251 49
a 0 251 49
ploy 0 251 49
to 0 251 49
put 0 251 49
Republicans 0 251 49
on 0 251 49
the 0 251 49
spot 0 251 49
for 0 251 49
taking 0 251 49
away 0 251 49
some 0 251 49
groups’ 0 251 49
handouts 0 251 49

the 0 251 49
rich.” 0 251 49

The 0 251 50
supply-side 0 251 50
policy 0 251 50
did 0 251 50
not 0 251 50
require 0 251 50
budget 0 251 50
cuts, 0 251 50
but 0 251 50
in 0 251 50
order 0 251 50
to 0 251 50
demonstrate 0 251 50
the 0 251 50
Democrats 0 251 50
lack 0 251 50
of 0 251 50
sincerety, 0 251 50
Hayakawa’s 0 251 50
aid 0 251 50
and 0 251 50
I 0 251 50
had 0 251 50
our 0 251 50
senators 0 251 50
introduce 0 251 50
a 0 251 50
series 0 251 50
of 0 251 50
budget 0 251 50
cuts 0 251 50
together 0 251 50
with 0 251 50
tax 0 251 50
cuts 0 251 50
that, 0 251 50
on 0 251 50
a 0 251 50
static 0 251 50
revenue 0 251 50
basis 0 251 50
(not 0 251 50
counting 0 251 50
tax 0 251 50

feedbacks 0 251 50
from 0 251 50
the 0 251 50

of 0 251 50
the 0 251 50
lower 0 251 50
tax 0 251 50
rates) 0 251 50
kept 0 251 50
the 0 251 50
budget 0 251 50
even, 0 251 50
and 0 251 50
the 0 251 50
Democrats 0 251 50
voted 0 251 50
against 0 251 50
them 0 251 50
every 0 251 50
time. 0 251 50

When 0 251 51
the 0 251 51
combination 0 251 51
of 0 251 51
tax 0 251 51
cuts 0 251 51
with 0 251 51
defense 0 251 51
budget 0 251 51

came 0 251 51
up 0 251 51
for 0 251 51
a 0 251 51
vote, 0 251 51
the 1 251 51
legendary 1 251 51
senator 1 251 51
Strom 0 251 51
Thurmond, 0 251 51
a 0 251 51
48-year 0 251 51
member 0 251 51
of 0 251 51
the 0 251 51
US 0 251 51
Senate 0 251 51
from 0 251 51
South 0 251 51
Carolina, 0 251 51
tapped 0 251 51
me 0 251 51
on 0 251 51
the 0 251 51
shoulder. 0 251 51

He 0 251 52
said: 0 251 52
“son, 1 251 52
never 1 251 52
set 1 251 52
your 1 251 52
senator 1 251 52
up 1 251 52
against 1 251 52
the 1 251 52

He 1 251 53
will 1 251 53
not 1 251 53
be 1 251 53
re-elected, 1 251 53
and 1 251 53
you 1 251 53
will 1 251 53
be 1 251 53
out 1 251 53
of 1 251 53
a 1 251 53
job.” 1 251 53
I 0 251 53
replied 0 251 53
that 0 251 53
we 0 251 53
were 0 251 53
just 0 251 53
establishing 0 251 53
for 0 251 53
the 0 251 53
record 0 251 53
that 0 251 53
under 0 251 53
no 0 251 53
conditions 0 251 53
would 0 251 53
the 0 251 53
Democrats, 0 251 53
who 0 251 53
wanted 0 251 53
more 0 251 53
government, 0 251 53
vote 0 251 53
for 0 251 53
a 0 251 53
tax 0 251 53
rate 0 251 53
reduction 0 251 53
even 0 251 53
if 0 251 53
there 0 251 53
was 0 251 53
a 0 251 53
case 0 251 53
that 0 251 53
it 0 251 53
would 0 251 53
cure 0 251 53
stagflation. 0 251 53

He 0 251 54
replied: 0 251 54
“son, 0 251 54
the 1 251 54
military/security 1 251 54
complex 1 251 54
doesn’t 1 251 54
care.” 1 251 54

My 0 251 55
emergence 1 251 55
from 1 251 55
The 1 251 55
Matrix 1 251 55
began 0 251 55
with 0 251 55
Thurmond’s 0 251 55
pat 0 251 55
on 0 251 55
my 0 251 55
shoulder. 0 251 55

It 0 251 56
grew 0 251 56
with 0 251 56
my 0 251 56
time 0 251 56
at 0 251 56
the 0 251 56
Wall 0 251 56
Street 0 251 56
Journal 0 251 56
when 0 251 56
I 0 251 56
learned 0 251 56
that 0 251 56
some 0 251 56
truthful 0 251 56
things 0 251 56
simply 0 251 56
could 0 251 56
not 0 251 56
be 0 251 56
said. 0 251 56

In 0 251 57
the 0 251 57
Treasury 0 251 57
I 0 251 57
experienced 0 251 57
how 0 251 57
those 0 251 57
outside 0 251 57
interests 0 251 57
opposed 0 251 57
to 0 251 57
a 0 251 57

marshall 1 251 57
their 1 251 57
forces 1 251 57
and 0 251 57
the 0 251 57
media 0 251 57
that 0 251 57
they 0 251 57
own 0 251 57
to 0 251 57
block 0 251 57
it. 0 251 57

Later 0 251 58
as 0 251 58
a 0 251 58
member 0 251 58
of 0 251 58
a 0 251 58
secret 0 251 58
presidential 0 251 58
committee, 0 251 58
I 0 251 58
saw 0 251 58
how 0 251 58
the 0 251 58
CIA 0 251 58
attempted 0 251 58
to 0 251 58
prevent 0 251 58
President 0 251 58

from 0 251 58

Today, 1 251 59
right 1 251 59
now, 1 251 59
at 1 251 59
this 1 251 59
moment, 1 251 59
we 1 251 59
are 1 251 59
faced 1 251 59
with 1 251 59
a 1 251 59
massive 1 251 59
effort 1 251 59
of 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
military/security 1 251 59

the 1 251 59
neoconservatives, 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
Democratic 1 251 59
Party, 1 251 59
and 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
presstitute 1 251 59
media 1 251 59
to 1 251 59
discredit 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
elected 1 251 59
President 1 251 59
of 1 251 59
the 1 251 59

and 1 251 59
to 1 251 59
overthrow 1 251 59
him 1 251 59
in 1 251 59
order 1 251 59
that 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
utterly 1 251 59
corrupt 1 251 59
elite 1 251 59
that 1 251 59
rule 1 251 59
American 1 251 59
can 1 251 59
continue 1 251 59
to 1 251 59
hold 1 251 59
on 1 251 59
to 1 251 59
power 1 251 59
and 1 251 59
to 1 251 59
protect 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
massive 1 251 59
budget 1 251 59
of 1 251 59
the 1 251 59
military/security 1 251 59
complex 1 251 59
that, 1 251 59
along 1 251 59
with 1 251 59

rule 1 251 59
us. 1 251 59

Trump, 0 251 60
like 0 251 60
Reagan, 0 251 60
was 0 251 60
an 0 251 60
exception, 0 251 60
and 0 251 60
it 0 251 60
is 0 251 60
the 0 251 60
exceptions 0 251 60
that 0 251 60
accumulate 0 251 60
the 0 251 60

him, 0 251 82
Russia 0 251 82

Keep 1 251 83
in 1 251 83
mind 1 251 83
that 1 251 83
no 1 251 83

No 1 251 85

If 1 251 86
you 1 251 86

you 1 251 86
are 1 251 86

beyond 1 251 86
all 1 251 86
hope. 1 251 86

Not 1 251 87
even 1 251 87
I 1 251 87
can 1 251 87
rescue 1 251 87
you. 1 251 87

Nor 1 251 88
God 1 251 88
himself. 1 251 88

Americans, 0 251 89
and 0 251 89
indeed 0 251 89
the 0 251 89
Russians 0 251 89
themselves, 0 251 89
are 0 251 89
incapable 0 251 89
of 0 251 89
realizing 0 251 89
it, 0 251 89
but 0 251 89
there 0 251 89
is 0 251 89
a 0 251 89
chance 0 251 89
that 0 251 89
Trump 0 251 89

be 0 251 89
overthrown 0 251 89
and 0 251 89
a 0 251 89
Western 0 251 89
assault 0 251 89
will 0 251 89
be 0 251 89
launched 0 251 89
against 0 251 89
the 0 251 89
handful 0 251 89
of 0 251 89

that 0 251 89
insist 0 251 89
on 0 251 89
sovereignty. 0 251 89

I 1 251 90
doubt 1 251 90
that 1 251 90
few 1 251 90
of 1 251 90
the 1 251 90
Americans 1 251 90
who 1 251 90
elected 1 251 90
Trump 1 251 90
will 1 251 90
be 1 251 90
taken 1 251 90
in 1 251 90
by 1 251 90
the 1 251 90
anti-Trump 1 251 90
propagana, 1 251 90
but 0 251 90
they 0 251 90
are 0 251 90
not 0 251 90
organized 0 251 90
and 0 251 90
have 0 251 90
no 0 251 90
armed 0 251 90
power. 0 251 90

The 0 251 91
police, 0 251 91
militarized 0 251 91
by 0 251 91
George 0 251 91
W. 0 251 91
Bush 0 251 91

Obama, 0 251 91
will 0 251 91
be 0 251 91
set 0 251 91
against 0 251 91
them. 0 251 91

The 0 251 92

will 0 251 92
be 0 251 92
local 0 251 92
and 0 251 92

by 0 251 92
every 0 251 92

In 0 252 35

Monday, 0 252 35
a 0 252 35
New 0 252 35

found 0 252 35
that 0 252 35
suspects 0 252 35

Two 0 252 36
Muslim 0 252 36
men 0 252 36
and 0 252 36
three 0 252 36
women 0 252 36
are 0 252 36
charged 0 252 36
with 0 252 36
11 0 252 36
counts 0 252 36
of 0 252 36
child 0 252 36
abuse 0 252 36
each 0 252 36
after 0 252 36
police 0 252 36
raided 0 252 36
their 0 252 36
compound 0 252 36
in 0 252 36
New 0 252 36
Mexico 0 252 36
and 0 252 36
discovered 0 252 36
11 1 252 36
malnourished 1 252 36
children 1 252 36
living 1 252 36
in 1 252 36
squalor. 1 252 36

Their 0 252 37
lawyer 0 252 37
argued 0 252 37
that 0 252 37
there 0 252 37
was 0 252 37
a 0 252 37
double 0 252 37
standard 0 252 37
in 0 252 37
the 0 252 37
case 0 252 37
because 0 252 37
his 0 252 37
clients 0 252 37
were 0 252 37
Muslims. 0 252 37

He 1 252 38
argued 1 252 38
that 1 252 38
if 1 252 38
they 1 252 38
had 1 252 38
been 1 252 38
Christian 1 252 38
and 1 252 38
white, 1 252 38
“we 1 252 38
might 1 252 38
not 1 252 38
be 1 252 38
here 1 252 38
today.” 1 252 38
Despite 0 252 38
law 0 252 38
enforcement 0 252 38
authorities 0 252 38
saying 0 252 38
that 0 252 38
they 0 252 38
believe 0 252 38
that 0 252 38
the 0 252 38
children 0 252 38
were 0 252 38
being 0 252 38
trained 0 252 38
to 0 252 38
attack 0 252 38
innocents, 0 252 38
and 0 252 38
that 0 252 38
the 0 252 38
adults 0 252 38
were 0 252 38
radicalized, 0 252 38
Judge 0 252 38
Sarah 0 252 38
Backus 0 252 38
released 0 252 38
the 0 252 38
suspects. 0 252 38

Prosecutors 0 252 39
also 0 252 39
said 0 252 39
they 0 252 39
obtained 0 252 39
a 0 252 39
letter 0 252 39
from 0 252 39
one 0 252 39
of 0 252 39
the 0 252 39
suspects 0 252 39
telling 0 252 39
his 0 252 39
brother 0 252 39
to 0 252 39
come 0 252 39
to 0 252 39
the 0 252 39
compound 0 252 39
and 0 252 39
die 1 252 39
like 1 252 39
a 1 252 39
martyr. 1 252 39

The 0 252 40
lawyer 0 252 40
for 0 252 40
the 0 252 40
suspects 0 252 40
said 0 252 40
that 0 252 40
there 0 252 40
was 0 252 40
no 0 252 40
evidence 0 252 40
that 0 252 40
they 0 252 40
were 0 252 40

Amazingly, 1 254 5
the 0 254 5

In 0 254 13

the 0 254 13

to 0 254 13

constant 0 254 13

it 0 258 22

Christian 0 258 22
doctrine… 0 258 22
that 0 258 22
frees 0 258 22
people 0 258 22
from 0 258 22
worldly 0 258 22
ideologies 0 258 22

can 0 258 24
only 0 258 24
possess, 0 258 24

an 0 258 24
ideology 0 258 24
– 0 258 24

counter 0 258 25

who 0 258 25

and 0 258 25
even 0 258 25
defend 0 258 25
them. 0 258 25

What 0 258 26
scandalizes 0 258 26
believers, 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
even 0 258 26
some 0 258 26
fellow 0 258 26
bishops, 0 258 26
is 0 258 26
not 0 258 26
only 0 258 26
your 0 258 26
having 0 258 26
appointed 0 258 26
such 0 258 26
men 0 258 26
to 0 258 26
be 0 258 26
shepherds 0 258 26
of 0 258 26
the 0 258 26
Church, 0 258 26
but 0 258 26
that 0 258 26
you 0 258 26
also 0 258 26
seem 0 258 26
silent 0 258 26
in 0 258 26
the 0 258 26
face 0 258 26
of 0 258 26
their 0 258 26
teaching 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
pastoral 0 258 26
practice…. 0 258 26

As 0 258 27
a 0 258 27
result, 0 258 27
many 0 258 27
of 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
faithful, 0 258 27
who 0 258 27
embody 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
"sensus 0 258 27
fidelium," 0 258 27
are 0 258 27
losing 0 258 27
confidence 0 258 27
in 0 258 27
their 0 258 27
supreme 0 258 27
shepherd. 0 258 27

[T]he 0 258 28
Church 0 258 28
is 0 258 28
one 0 258 28
body, 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
Mystical 0 258 28
Body 0 258 28
of 0 258 28
Christ, 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
you 0 258 28
are 0 258 28
commissioned 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
Lord 0 258 28
himself 0 258 28
to 0 258 28
promote 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
strengthen 0 258 28
her 0 258 28
unity. 0 258 28

But 0 258 29
your 0 258 29
actions 0 258 29
and 0 258 29
words 0 258 29
too 0 258 29
often 0 258 29
seem 0 258 29
intent 0 258 29
on 0 258 29
doing 0 258 29
the 0 258 29
opposite…. 0 258 29

You 0 258 30
have 0 258 30
often 0 258 30
spoken 0 258 30
about 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
need 0 258 30
for 0 258 30
transparency 0 258 30
within 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
Church. 0 258 30

You 0 258 31
have 0 258 31
frequently 0 258 31
encouraged… 0 258 31
all 0 258 31
persons, 0 258 31
especially 0 258 31
bishops, 0 258 31
to 0 258 31
speak 0 258 31
their 0 258 31
mind 0 258 31
and 0 258 31
not 0 258 31
be 0 258 31
fearful 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
what 0 258 31
the 0 258 31
pope 0 258 31
may 0 258 31
think. 0 258 31

But… 0 258 32
what 0 258 32
many 0 258 32
[bishops] 0 258 32
have 0 258 32
learned 0 258 32
from 0 258 32
your 0 258 32
pontificate 0 258 32
is 0 258 32
not 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
you 0 258 32
are 0 258 32
open 0 258 32
to 0 258 32
criticism, 0 258 32
but 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
you 0 258 32
resent 0 258 32
it… 0 258 32
Many 0 258 32
fear 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
if 0 258 32
they 0 258 32
speak 0 258 32
their 0 258 32
mind, 0 258 32
they 0 258 32
will 0 258 32
be 0 258 32
marginalized 0 258 32
or 0 258 32
worse. 0 258 32

I 0 258 33
have 0 258 33
often 0 258 33
asked 0 258 33
myself: 0 258 33
"Why 0 258 33
has 0 258 33
Jesus 0 258 33
let 0 258 33
all 0 258 33
of 0 258 33
this 0 258 33
happen?" 0 258 33

The 1 258 34
only 1 258 34
answer 1 258 34
that 1 258 34
comes 1 258 34
to 1 258 34
mind 1 258 34
is 1 258 34
that 1 258 34
Jesus 1 258 34
wants 1 258 34
to 1 258 34
manifest 1 258 34
just 1 258 34
how 1 258 34
weak 1 258 34
is 1 258 34
the 1 258 34
faith 1 258 34
of 1 258 34
many 1 258 34
within 1 258 34
the 1 258 34
Church, 1 258 34
even 1 258 34
among 1 258 34
too 1 258 34
many 1 258 34
of 1 258 34
her 1 258 34
bishops. 1 258 34

Ironically, 1 258 35
your 1 258 35
pontificate 1 258 35
has 1 258 35
given 1 258 35
those 1 258 35
who 1 258 35
hold 1 258 35
harmful 1 258 35
theological 1 258 35
and 1 258 35
pastoral 1 258 35
views 1 258 35
the 1 258 35
license 1 258 35
and 1 258 35
confidence 1 258 35
to 1 258 35
come 1 258 35
into 1 258 35
the 1 258 35
light 1 258 35
and 1 258 35
expose 1 258 35
their 1 258 35
previously 1 258 35
hidden 1 258 35
darkness…. 1 258 35

Father 0 258 36
Weinandy 0 258 36
reveals 0 258 36
that 0 258 36
he 0 258 36
decided 0 258 36
to 0 258 36
publicize 0 258 36
this 0 258 36
historic 0 258 36
missive 0 258 36
only 0 258 36
after 0 258 36
receiving 0 258 36
an 0 258 36
unmistakable 0 258 36
sign 0 258 36
from 0 258 36
heaven. 0 258 36

As 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
recounts 0 258 37
here, 0 258 37
after 0 258 37
repeatedly 0 258 37
“beseeching 0 258 37
Jesus 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
Mary, 0 258 37
St. 0 258 37
Peter 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
all 0 258 37
of 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
saintly 0 258 37
popes 0 258 37
who 0 258 37
are 0 258 37
buried 0 258 37
there 0 258 37
to 0 258 37
do 0 258 37
something 0 258 37
to 0 258 37
rectify 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
confusion 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
turmoil 0 258 37
within 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
Church 0 258 37
today, 0 258 37
a 0 258 37
chaos 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
an 0 258 37
uncertainty 0 258 37
that 0 258 37
I 0 258 37
felt 0 258 37
Pope 0 258 37
Francis 0 258 37
had 0 258 37
himself 0 258 37
caused,” 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
asked 0 258 37
for 0 258 37
a 0 258 37
minutely 0 258 37
specific 0 258 37
sign 0 258 37
from 0 258 37
heaven 0 258 37
on 0 258 37
whether 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
should 0 258 37
write 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
letter: 0 258 37
that 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
next 0 258 37
day 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
would 0 258 37
meet 0 258 37
someone 0 258 37
he 0 258 37
had 0 258 37
not 0 258 37
seen 0 258 37
in 0 258 37
a 0 258 37
very 0 258 37
long 0 258 37
time, 0 258 37
would 0 258 37
never 0 258 37
expect 0 258 37
to 0 258 37
see 0 258 37
in 0 258 37
Rome, 0 258 37
and 0 258 37
was 0 258 37
not 0 258 37
from 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
United 0 258 37
States, 0 258 37
Canada 0 258 37
or 0 258 37
Great 0 258 37
Britain, 0 258 37
which 0 258 37
person 0 258 37
would 0 258 37
utter 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
particular 0 258 37
phrase: 0 258 37
“Keep 0 258 37
up 0 258 37
the 0 258 37
good 0 258 37
writing.” 0 258 37

At 0 258 38
lunch 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
next 0 258 38
day, 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
sign 0 258 38
was 0 258 38
given. 0 258 38

An 0 258 39
old 0 258 39
friend 0 258 39
he 0 258 39
had 0 258 39
not 0 258 39
seen 0 258 39
in 0 258 39
more 0 258 39
than 0 258 39
twenty 0 258 39
years 0 258 39
and 0 258 39
would 0 258 39
never 0 258 39
have 0 258 39
expected 0 258 39
to 0 258 39
meet 0 258 39
in 0 258 39
Rome, 0 258 39
who 0 258 39
is 0 258 39
now 0 258 39
an 0 258 39
archbishop, 0 258 39
appeared 0 258 39
suddenly 0 258 39
from 0 258 39
between 0 258 39
two 0 258 39
parked 0 258 39
cars, 0 258 39
renewed 0 258 39
acquaintances 0 258 39
and, 0 258 39
referring 0 258 39
to 0 258 39
one 0 258 39
of 0 258 39
Father 0 258 39
Weinandy’s 0 258 39
books, 0 258 39
said: 0 258 39
“Keep 0 258 39
up 0 258 39
the 0 258 39
good 0 258 39
writing.” 0 258 39

Writes 0 258 40
Fr. 0 258 40

Weinandy: 0 258 41
“I 0 258 41
could 0 258 41
hardly 0 258 41
believe 0 258 41
that 0 258 41
this 0 258 41
just 0 258 41
happened 0 258 41
in 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
matter 0 258 41
of 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
few 0 258 41
minutes. 0 258 41

But 0 258 42
there 0 258 42
was 0 258 42
no 0 258 42
longer 0 258 42
any 0 258 42
doubt 0 258 42
in 0 258 42
my 0 258 42
mind 0 258 42
that 0 258 42
Jesus 0 258 42
wanted 0 258 42
me 0 258 42
to 0 258 42
write 0 258 42
something. 0 258 42

I 0 258 43
also 0 258 43
think 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
significant 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
was 0 258 43
an 0 258 43
Archbishop 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
Jesus 0 258 43
used. 0 258 43

I 0 258 44
considered 0 258 44
it 0 258 44
an 0 258 44
apostolic 0 258 44
mandate.” 0 258 44

Can 0 258 45
we 0 258 45
doubt 0 258 45
that 0 258 45
it 0 258 45
was 0 258 45
indeed 0 258 45
an 0 258 45
apostolic 0 258 45
mandate? 0 258 45

Can 0 258 46
we 0 258 46
not 0 258 46

last 0 260 46
for 0 260 46
years. 0 260 46

The 0 260 47
timing 0 260 47
is 0 260 47
eerily 1 260 47
propitious 0 260 47
and 0 260 47
providential 0 260 47
based 0 260 47
on 0 260 47
the 0 260 47
5 0 260 47
year 0 260 47
deadline. 0 260 47

Will 0 260 48
the 0 260 48
laity 0 260 48
step 0 260 48
up 0 260 48
and 0 260 48
reclaim 0 260 48
our 0 260 48
hijacked 1 260 48
Catholic 0 260 48
Church? 0 260 48

This 0 260 49
critical 0 260 49
time 0 260 49
in 0 260 49
the 0 260 49
history 0 260 49
of 0 260 49
the 0 260 49
Catholic 0 260 49
Church 0 260 49
demands 0 260 49
that 0 260 49
the 0 260 49
laity 0 260 49
step 0 260 49
forward 0 260 49
to 0 260 49
protect 0 260 49
the 0 260 49
Church, 0 260 49
its 0 260 49
children 0 260 49
and 0 260 49
seminarians 0 260 49
from 0 260 49
predators. 0 260 49

We 0 260 50
must 0 260 50
close 0 260 50
ranks 0 260 50
before 0 260 50
another 0 260 50
precious 0 260 50
child 0 260 50

exploited, 0 260 50
a 0 260 50

Remember 0 260 52
that 0 260 52
influential 1 260 52
Roman 0 260 52
gentleman 0 260 52
friend 0 260 52
of 0 260 52
McCarrick 0 260 52
who 0 260 52
said 0 260 52
that 0 260 52
Bergoglio 0 260 52
could 0 260 52
reform 0 260 52
the 0 260 52
Church 0 260 52
in 0 260 52
5 0 260 52
years? 0 260 52

Bergoglio’s 0 260 53
upcoming 0 260 53
Synod 0 260 53
on 0 260 53
Young 0 260 53
People 0 260 53
will 0 260 53
serve 0 260 53
as 0 260 53
the 0 260 53
culminating 0 260 53
vehicle 0 260 53
for 0 260 53
the 0 260 53
5 0 260 53
year 0 260 53
modernist 0 260 53
reform 0 260 53
of 0 260 53
the 0 260 53
St. 1 260 53
Gallen 1 260 53
Mafia. 1 260 53

This 0 260 54
Synod 0 260 54
is 0 260 54
designed 0 260 54
to 0 260 54
exploit 0 260 54
the 0 260 54
youth, 0 260 54
like 0 260 54
they’ve 0 260 54
been 0 260 54
doing 0 260 54
for 0 260 54
the 0 260 54
last 0 260 54
60 0 260 54
years. 0 260 54

If 0 260 55
it 0 260 55
weren’t 0 260 55
so 0 260 55
infuriating, 1 260 55
it 0 260 55
would 0 260 55
be 0 260 55
laughable 0 260 55
that 0 260 55
following 0 260 55
the 0 260 55
McCarrick 0 260 55
scandal 0 260 55
of 0 260 55
sexual 0 260 55
predation 0 260 55
of 0 260 55
young 0 260 55
males 0 260 55
and 0 260 55
seminarians, 0 260 55
by 0 260 55
a 0 260 55
Cardinal, 0 260 55
and 0 260 55
covered 0 260 55
up 0 260 55
by 0 260 55
Bishops, 0 260 55
the 0 260 55
Catholic 0 260 55
Church 0 260 55
would 0 260 55
host 0 260 55
a 0 260 55
Synod 0 260 55
of 0 260 55
Bishops 0 260 55
on 0 260 55
the 0 260 55
topic 0 260 55
of 0 260 55
young 0 260 55
people 0 260 55
and 0 260 55
vocations! 0 260 55

Furthermore, 0 260 56
this 0 260 56
nightmare 0 260 56
of 0 260 56
a 0 260 56
“sinod" 0 260 56
is 0 260 56
inviting 0 260 56
youth 0 260 56
from 0 260 56
ages 0 260 56
16-29 0 260 56
to 0 260 56
mingle 0 260 56
with 0 260 56
the 0 260 56
Bishops 0 260 56
to 0 260 56
discuss 0 260 56
the 0 260 56
Church, 0 260 56
faith 0 260 56
and 0 260 56
vocations. 0 260 56

Are 1 260 57
you 1 260 57
thoroughly 1 260 57
disgusted 1 260 57
by 1 260 57
this 1 260 57
farce? 1 260 57

The 0 260 58
Bishops 0 260 58
have 0 260 58
proven 0 260 58
that 0 260 58
they 0 260 58
cannot 0 260 58
be 0 260 58
trusted 0 260 58
to 0 260 58
protect 0 260 58
young 0 260 58
people 0 260 58
and 0 260 58
seminarians 0 260 58
from 0 260 58
predators. 0 260 58

The 0 260 59
ever 0 260 59
growing 0 260 59
global 0 260 59
list 0 260 59
of 0 260 59
Bishops 0 260 59
and 0 260 59
Cardinals 0 260 59
that 0 260 59
have 0 260 59
preyed 0 260 59
on 0 260 59
/and 0 260 59
or 0 260 59
covered 0 260 59
up 0 260 59
the 0 260 59
sexual 0 260 59
abuse 0 260 59
of 0 260 59
minors 0 260 59
and 0 260 59
seminarians 0 260 59
over 0 260 59
the 0 260 59
last 0 260 59
60 0 260 59
years 0 260 59
continues 0 260 59
to 0 260 59
enrage 0 260 59
the 0 260 59
laity. 0 260 59

We 0 260 60
are 0 260 60
no 0 260 60
longer 0 260 60
Shocked, 0 260 60
just 0 260 60
fed 0 260 60
up. 0 260 60

Let’s 0 260 61
start 0 260 61
with 0 260 61
the 0 260 61
Cardinal 0 260 61
who 0 260 61
will 0 260 61
lead 0 260 61
the 0 260 61
upcoming 0 260 61
Synod, 0 260 61
none 0 260 61
other 0 260 61
than 0 260 61
Cardinal 0 260 61
Kevin 0 260 61
Farrell, 0 260 61
Prefect 0 260 61
of 0 260 61
the 0 260 61
Dicastery 0 260 61
for 0 260 61
Laity, 0 260 61
Family 0 260 61
and 0 260 61
Life. 0 260 61

As 0 260 62
the 0 260 62
DC 0 260 62
roommate 0 260 62
and 0 260 62
protege 0 260 62
of 0 260 62
Ted 0 260 62
McCarrick, 0 260 62
Farrell 0 260 62
so 0 260 62
respected 0 260 62
McCarrick, 0 260 62
the 0 260 62
Molester, 1 260 62
that 0 260 62
he 0 260 62
fashioned 0 260 62
his 0 260 62
Coat 0 260 62
of 0 260 62
Arms 0 260 62
as 0 260 62
a 0 260 62
tribute 0 260 62
to 0 260 62
Uncle 0 260 62
Ted. 0 260 62

Farrell’s 0 260 63
pathetic 1 260 63
and 1 260 63
laughable 1 260 63
defense 0 260 63
“I 0 260 63
never 0 260 63
knew 0 260 63
anything 0 260 63
about 0 260 63
McCarrick” 0 260 63
video 0 260 63
highlights 0 260 63
the 0 260 63
continuing 0 260 63
conspiracy 0 260 63
of 0 260 63

by 0 260 63
the 0 260 63
U.S. 0 260 63
Catholic 0 260 63
hierarchy. 0 260 63

Undoubtedly, 0 260 64
Farrell 0 260 64
as 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
head 0 260 64
of 0 260 64
this 0 260 64

Synod. 0 260 66

Farrell’s 0 260 67
graciously 0 260 67

notorious 0 260 67
praise 0 260 67
for 0 260 67

his 0 260 68
obvious 0 260 68
underlying 0 260 68
homosexual 0 260 68

and 0 260 68
aura 0 260 68
of 0 260 68
the 0 260 68
upcoming 0 260 68
Synod: 0 260 68

“A 0 260 69
welcome 0 260 69
and 0 260 69
much-needed 0 260 69

the 0 260 69

for 0 260 71
Martin’s 0 260 71
book, 0 260 71
Cardinal 0 260 71
Farrell! 0 260 71

Contrary 0 260 72
to 0 260 72
the 0 260 72
theme 0 260 72
of 0 260 72
mercy 0 260 72
and 0 260 72
compassion 0 260 72
to 0 260 72
LGBTs, 0 260 72
it 0 260 72
appears 0 260 72
that 0 260 72
your 0 260 72
mentor, 0 260 72
McCarrick 0 260 72
set 0 260 72
out 0 260 72
to 0 260 72

and 0 260 72
grow 0 260 72
an 0 260 72
LGBT 0 260 72

Clearly, 0 260 73
you 0 260 73
and 0 260 73
Fr. 0 260 73

Martin 0 260 74
have 0 260 74
much 0 260 74
in 0 260 74
common 0 260 74
since 0 260 74
you 0 260 74
both 0 260 74
claimed 0 260 74
you 0 260 74
were 0 260 74
“shocked” 0 260 74
by 0 260 74
the 0 260 74
McCarrick 0 260 74
allegations. 0 260 74

Explain 0 260 75
to 0 260 75
Catholics 0 260 75
why 0 260 75
would 0 260 75
you 0 260 75
headline 0 260 75

Synod 0 260 75
for 0 260 75
youth 0 260 75
and 0 260 75

In 0 260 76
case 0 260 76
you 0 260 76
haven’t 0 260 76
been 0 260 76
reading 0 260 76
the 0 260 76

the 0 260 76
plunging 0 260 76
mass 0 260 76
attendance 0 260 76
and 0 260 76
collections, 0 260 76
Catholics 0 260 76
don’t 0 260 76
trust 0 260 76
their 0 260 76
boys 0 260 76
around 0 260 76
priests 0 260 76
and 0 260 76
are 0 260 76
furious 0 260 76
that 0 260 76
their 0 260 76

subjected 0 260 76
to 0 260 76
unrelenting 0 260 76
homosexual 0 260 76

harassment. 0 260 76

McCarrick 0 260 77
is 0 260 77
the 0 260 77
last 0 260 77
straw. 0 260 77

All 1 260 78
credibility 1 260 78
is 1 260 78
lost. 1 260 78

The 0 260 79
October 0 260 79

is 0 260 79

another 0 260 79

Bergoglio’s 0 260 80
five 0 260 80

plan 0 260 80
is 0 260 80
nearly 0 260 80
complete. 0 260 80

Catholics 0 260 81
must 0 260 81
shed 0 260 81
their 0 260 81

naivety 0 260 81

They're 1 268 15
all 1 268 15
crazy 1 268 15

A 0 268 16
Muslim 0 268 16
terrorist 0 268 16

proclaiming 0 268 17
the 0 268 17
glory 0 268 17
of 0 268 17
Allah, 0 268 17

all 0 268 17

must 1 268 18
die”. 1 268 18

The 0 268 19
German 0 268 19
authorities 0 268 19
came 0 268 19
to 0 268 19
the 0 268 19
inescapable 0 268 19
conclusion 0 268 19
that 0 268 19
the 0 268 19
attack 0 268 19
had 0 268 19
nothing 0 268 19
to 0 268 19
do 0 268 19
with 0 268 19
Islam. 0 268 19

Instead 0 268 20

been 0 268 20
“mentally 1 268 20

was 0 268 20

not 0 268 20

fit 0 268 20
to 0 268 20

He 0 268 29
also 0 268 29
stabbed 0 268 29
two 0 268 29

Police 0 268 30

In 0 268 31
December 0 268 31
of 0 268 31
last 0 268 31
year, 0 268 31
Saleh 0 268 31
Ali, 0 268 31
a 0 268 31
Syrian 0 268 31
refugee 0 268 31
wearing 0 268 31
a 0 268 31
keffiyah 0 268 31
and 0 268 31
waving 0 268 31
a 0 268 31
terrorist 0 268 31
PLO 0 268 31
flag, 0 268 31
went 0 268 31
up 0 268 31
to 0 268 31
a 0 268 31
Jewish 0 268 31
restaurant 0 268 31
in 0 268 31
Amsterdam, 0 268 31
shouted 0 268 31
“Allahu 1 268 31
Akbar” 1 268 31
and 0 268 31
began 0 268 31
smashing 0 268 31
the 0 268 31
windows. 0 268 31

The 0 268 32
police 0 268 32
stood 0 268 32
by 0 268 32
and 0 268 32
watched 0 268 32
until 0 268 32
he 0 268 32
was 0 268 32
done. 0 268 32

And 0 268 33
then 0 268 33
they 0 268 33
arrested 0 268 33
him. 0 268 33

Ali 0 268 34
admitted 0 268 34
to 0 268 34
having 0 268 34
fought 0 268 34
with 0 268 34
Jihadists 0 268 34
in 0 268 34
Syria. 0 268 34

So 0 268 35
the 0 268 35
system 0 268 35
decided 0 268 35
that 0 268 35
he 0 268 35
needed 0 268 35
a 0 268 35
psychiatric 0 268 35
evaluation 0 268 35

Maybe 0 268 36
it's 0 268 36
not 0 268 36
the 0 268 36
terrorists 0 268 36
who 0 268 36
are 0 268 36
nuts. 1 268 36

Maybe 1 268 37
it's 1 268 37
the 1 268 37
authorities 1 268 37
who 1 268 37
are 1 268 37
insane. 1 268 37

at 0 269 20
Haig's 0 269 20
home 0 269 20
in 0 269 20
Mesa, 0 269 20

at 0 269 20
the 0 269 20

show. 0 269 20

Victor 0 269 21
said 0 269 21
a 0 269 21
box 0 269 21
that 0 269 21
Paddock 0 269 21
used 0 269 21

ammunition 0 269 21
out 0 269 21
of 0 269 21

It's 0 269 22
unknown 0 269 22

ammunition 0 269 22
Haig 0 269 22
sold 0 269 22
to 0 269 22
Paddock 0 269 22

used 0 269 22
in 0 269 22
the 0 269 22
attack. 0 269 22

The 0 269 23

quantity 0 269 23
of 0 269 23

Paddock 0 269 23
bought 0 269 23
from 0 269 23
his 0 269 23

that 0 271 5
being 0 271 5
gay 0 271 5

“Most 0 272 11

it 0 272 11

“‬Many 0 272 11

a 0 272 12
simple 0 272 12
question: 0 272 12
why 0 272 12
did 0 272 12
they 0 272 12
literally 0 272 12
risk 0 272 12
their 0 272 12
lives 0 272 12
to 0 272 12

Catholic 0 272 12

is 0 272 12
“a 0 272 12
good 0 272 12
religion 0 272 12
in 0 272 12
itself” 0 272 12
as 0 272 12
the 0 272 12
pope 0 272 12
“seems 0 272 12
to 0 272 12
teach”? 0 272 12

It’s 0 272 13
a 0 272 13
question 0 272 13
he 0 272 13
refuses 0 272 13
to 0 272 13
answer, 0 272 13
despite 0 272 13
endless 0 272 13
platitudes 0 272 13
of 0 272 13
how 0 272 13
important 0 272 13
it 0 272 13
is 0 272 13
to 0 272 13
be 0 272 13
close 0 272 13
to 0 272 13
the 0 272 13
marginalized 0 272 13
and 0 272 13
to 0 272 13

those 0 272 13
on 0 272 13
the 0 272 13

The 0 272 14
signers, 0 272 14
however, 0 272 14
are 0 272 14
not 0 272 14
dissuaded 0 272 14
in 0 272 14
their 0 272 14
pursuit 0 272 14
of 0 272 14
a 0 272 14
paternal 0 272 14
answer: 0 272 14

You 0 272 15
do 0 272 15
not 0 272 15
like 0 272 15
to 0 272 15
beat 0 272 15
around 0 272 15
the 0 272 15
bush, 0 272 15
and 0 272 15
neither 0 272 15
do 0 272 15
we, 0 272 15
so 0 272 15
allow 0 272 15
us 0 272 15
to 0 272 15
say 0 272 15
frankly 0 272 15
that 0 272 15
we 0 272 15
do 0 272 15
not 0 272 15
understand 0 272 15
your 0 272 15
teaching 0 272 15
about 0 272 15
Islam, 0 272 15
as 0 272 15
we 0 272 15
read 0 272 15
in 0 272 15
paragraphs 0 272 15
252 0 272 15
and 0 272 15
253 0 272 15
of 0 272 15
Evangelii 0 272 15
Gaudium, 0 272 15
because 0 272 15
it 1 272 15
does 1 272 15
not 1 272 15
account 1 272 15
for 1 272 15
the 1 272 15
fact 1 272 15
that 1 272 15
Islam 1 272 15
came 1 272 15
AFTER 1 272 15
Christ, 1 272 15
and 1 272 15
so 1 272 15
is, 1 272 15
and 1 272 15
can 1 272 15
only 1 272 15
be, 1 272 15
an 1 272 15
Antichrist 1 272 15
(see 0 272 15
1 0 272 15
Jn 0 272 15
2.22), 0 272 15
and 0 272 15
one 0 272 15
of 0 272 15
the 0 272 15
most 0 272 15
dangerous 0 272 15
because 0 272 15
it 0 272 15
presents 0 272 15
itself 0 272 15
as 0 272 15
the 0 272 15
fulfillment 0 272 15
of 0 272 15
Revelation 0 272 15
(of 0 272 15
which 0 272 15
Jesus 0 272 15
would 0 272 15
have 0 272 15
been 0 272 15
only 0 272 15
a 0 272 15
prophet). 0 272 15

If 1 272 16
Islam 1 272 16
is 1 272 16
a 1 272 16
good 1 272 16
religion 1 272 16
in 1 272 16
itself, 1 272 16
as 1 272 16
you 1 272 16
seem 1 272 16
to 1 272 16
teach, 1 272 16
why 1 272 16
did 1 272 16
we 1 272 16
become 1 272 16
Catholic? 1 272 16

Do 0 272 17
not 0 272 17
your 0 272 17
words 0 272 17
question 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
soundness 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
choice 0 272 17
we 0 272 17
made 0 272 17
at 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
risk 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
our 0 272 17
lives? 0 272 17

Islam 0 272 18
prescribes 0 272 18
death 0 272 18
for 0 272 18
apostates 0 272 18
(Quran 0 272 18
4.89, 0 272 18
8.7-11), 0 272 18
do 0 272 18
you 0 272 18
know? 0 272 18

How 0 272 19
is 0 272 19
it 0 272 19
possible 0 272 19
to 0 272 19
compare 0 272 19
Islamic 0 272 19
violence 0 272 19
with 0 272 19
so-called 0 272 19
Christian 0 272 19
violence? 0 272 19

“What 0 272 20
is 0 272 20
the 0 272 20
relationship 0 272 20
between 0 272 20

is 0 272 21
there 0 272 21
between 0 272 21

between 0 272 22
the 0 272 22
faithful 0 272 22

unfaithful?” 0 272 22
(2 0 272 22

6: 0 272 22
14-17)In 0 272 22

His 0 272 22
teaching 0 272 22
(Lk 0 272 22

Christ, 0 272 22
to 0 272 22

Are 0 272 23
we 0 272 23
not 0 272 23
in 0 272 23
a 0 272 23
good 0 272 23

to 0 272 23
talk 0 272 23
to 0 272 23
you 0 272 23
about 0 272 23
Islam? 0 272 23

The 0 272 24
letter 0 272 24
makes 0 272 24
short 0 272 24
work 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
notion 0 272 24
that 0 272 24
Islam 0 272 24
and 0 272 24
Christianity 0 272 24
can 0 272 24
ever 0 272 24
be 0 272 24
compatible, 0 272 24
or 0 272 24
that 0 272 24
Islam 0 272 24
can 0 272 24
serve 0 272 24
as 0 272 24
a 0 272 24
path 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
salvation: 0 272 24

In 0 272 25
fact, 0 272 25
as 0 272 25
long 0 272 25
as 0 272 25
Islam 0 272 25
wants 0 272 25
us 0 272 25
to 0 272 25
be 0 272 25
its 0 272 25
enemy, 0 272 25
we 0 272 25
are, 0 272 25
and 0 272 25
all 0 272 25
our 0 272 25
protestations 0 272 25
of 0 272 25
friendship 0 272 25
cannot 0 272 25
change 0 272 25
anything. 0 272 25

As 1 272 26
a 1 272 26
proper 1 272 26
Antichrist, 1 272 26
Islam 1 272 26
exists 1 272 26
only 1 272 26
as 1 272 26
an 1 272 26
enemy 1 272 26
of 1 272 26

“Between 0 272 26

For 1 272 26
the 1 272 26

Christians 1 272 26
“are 1 272 26

exterminate 1 272 26
them 1 272 26
(Quran 0 272 26

We 0 272 27
must 0 272 27
not 0 272 27
be 0 272 27
deceived 0 272 27
by 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
Quranic 0 272 27
verses 0 272 27

your 1 275 7
addition 1 275 7
“in 1 275 7
individual 1 275 7
cases” 1 275 7
is 1 275 7
absolutely 1 275 7

no 1 275 7

Bode 0 275 9
have 0 275 9
now 0 275 9
opened 0 275 9
up 0 275 9

the 0 275 9

blessing. 0 275 9

Why 1 275 10
not, 1 275 10
one 1 275 10
could 1 275 10
say, 1 275 10
since 1 275 10
the 1 275 10
Church 1 275 10
is 1 275 10
ready 1 275 10

nearly 1 275 10
everything 1 275 10
on 1 275 10
the 1 275 10
earth? 1 275 10

Now, 0 275 11
the 0 275 11
Church 0 275 11
especially 0 275 11
blesses 0 275 11
people, 0 275 11
but 0 275 11
also 0 275 11
deeds 0 275 11
and 0 275 11
objects. 0 275 11

blessings: 0 275 12

For 0 275 13
Catholics, 0 275 13
really 0 275 13
everything 0 275 13
can 0 275 13
be 0 275 13
blessed, 0 275 13
not 0 275 13
only 0 275 13
places 0 275 13
of 0 275 13
worship, 0 275 13
chalices, 0 275 13
and 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
faithful 0 275 13
after 0 275 13
each 0 275 13
prayer 0 275 13
service 0 275 13
– 0 275 13
whether 0 275 13
after 0 275 13
a 0 275 13
Mass, 0 275 13
or 0 275 13
after 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
prayers 0 275 13
for 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
hours 0 275 13
of 0 275 13
the 0 275 13
day. 0 275 13

The 0 275 14
blessing 0 275 14
is 0 275 14
also 0 275 14
not 0 275 14
limited 0 275 14
to 0 275 14
rosaries 0 275 14
or 0 275 14
religious 0 275 14
medal, 0 275 14
but 0 275 14
one 0 275 14
may 0 275 14
also 0 275 14
bless 0 275 14
cars, 0 275 14
factory 0 275 14
halls, 0 275 14
animals, 0 275 14
herbs, 0 275 14
and 0 275 14
much 0 275 14
more. 0 275 14

Some 0 275 15
blessings 0 275 15
are 0 275 15
only 0 275 15
to 0 275 15
be 0 275 15

priests 0 275 15
and 0 275 15
deacons, 0 275 15
especially 0 275 15
when 0 275 15
it 0 275 15
is 0 275 15
about 0 275 15
objects 0 275 15
of 0 275 15

such 0 275 15
as 0 275 15
chalices 0 275 15
or 0 275 15
vestments. 0 275 15

But 0 275 16
parents 0 275 16
can 0 275 16
bless 0 275 16
their 0 275 16
children. 0 275 16

The 0 275 17
faithful 0 275 17
may 0 275 17
also 0 275 17
take 0 275 17
home 0 275 17
holy 0 275 17
water 0 275 17
and 0 275 17
sprinkle 0 275 17
it 0 275 17
on 0 275 17
members 0 275 17
of 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
family, 0 275 17
but 0 275 17
also 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
stable 0 275 17
and 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
animals, 0 275 17
thus 0 275 17
blessing 0 275 17
them. 0 275 17

[...] 0 275 18

What 0 275 19
kind 0 275 19
of 0 275 19
hope 0 275 19
is 0 275 19
connected 0 275 19
with 0 275 19
a 0 275 19
blessing? 0 275 19

With 0 275 20
regard 0 275 20
to 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
car, 0 275 20
certainly 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
wish 0 275 20
for 0 275 20
heavenly 0 275 20
protection 0 275 20
– 0 275 20
sometimes 0 275 20
also 0 275 20
expressed 0 275 20
with 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
help 0 275 20
of 0 275 20
a 0 275 20
medal 0 275 20
of 0 275 20
St. 0 275 20
Christopher, 0 275 20
the 0 275 20
patron 0 275 20
saint 0 275 20
of 0 275 20
car 0 275 20
drivers. 0 275 20

With 0 275 21
the 0 275 21
weather 0 275 21
blessing, 0 275 21
one 0 275 21
prays 0 275 21
explicitly 0 275 21
for 0 275 21
protection 0 275 21
against 0 275 21
hail, 0 275 21
lightning 0 275 21
and 0 275 21
drought. 0 275 21

[…] 0 275 22

To 1 275 23
bless 1 275 23
always 1 275 23
means 1 275 23
that 1 275 23
something 1 275 23
shall 1 275 23
flourish, 1 275 23
because 1 275 23
only 1 275 23
then 1 275 23
when 1 275 23
there 1 275 23
is 1 275 23
a 1 275 23
blessing 1 275 23
upon 1 275 23
a 1 275 23
cause 1 275 23
or 1 275 23
a 1 275 23
project, 1 275 23
will 1 275 23
something 1 275 23
good 1 275 23
come 1 275 23
out 1 275 23
of 1 275 23
it. 1 275 23

The 0 275 24
blessing 0 275 24
comes 0 275 24
from 0 275 24
God, 0 275 24
He 0 275 24
is 0 275 24
being 0 275 24
addressed 0 275 24
in 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
form 0 275 24
of 0 275 24
a 0 275 24
request; 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
it 0 275 24
is 0 275 24
given 0 275 24
to 0 275 24
people, 0 275 24
objects, 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
buildings, 0 275 24
with 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
help 0 275 24
of 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
sign 0 275 24
of 0 275 24
the 0 275 24
cross, 0 275 24
holy 0 275 24
water, 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
incense. 0 275 24

[…] 0 275 25

But 0 275 26
now 0 275 26
concerning 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
question 0 275 26
of 0 275 26
Cardinal 0 275 26
Marx, 0 275 26
and 0 275 26
not 0 275 26
a 0 275 26
few 0 275 26
of 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
priests, 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
answer 0 275 26
is 0 275 26
simple: 0 275 26
one 0 275 26
may 0 275 26
ask 0 275 26
for 0 275 26
God's 0 275 26
blessing 0 275 26
for 0 275 26
sinners, 0 275 26
but 0 275 26
not 0 275 26
for 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
sin. 0 275 26

That 1 275 27
is 1 275 27
to 1 275 27
say, 1 275 27
one 1 275 27
could 1 275 27
not 1 275 27
consecrate 1 275 27
a 1 275 27
brothel, 1 275 27
one 1 275 27
could 1 275 27
not 1 275 27
bless 1 275 27
a 1 275 27
concentration 1 275 27
camp 1 275 27
or 1 275 27
weapons 1 275 27
which 1 275 27
are 1 275 27
not 1 275 27
explicitly 1 275 27
ordained 1 275 27
for 1 275 27
hunting 1 275 27
or 1 275 27
for 1 275 27
legitimate 1 275 27
self-defense. 1 275 27

Therefore 0 275 28
it 0 275 28
is 0 275 28
clear 0 275 28
that 0 275 28
one 1 275 28
may 1 275 28
not 1 275 28
bless 1 275 28
a 1 275 28
relationship 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
is 1 275 28
sinful; 1 275 28
[one 1 275 28
may 1 275 28
not 1 275 28
bless] 1 275 28
the 1 275 28
mafia; 1 275 28
no 1 275 28
blessing 1 275 28
for 1 275 28
organizations 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
institutions 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
promote 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
procure 1 275 28
abortions 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
propagate 1 275 28
ideologies 1 275 28
which 1 275 28
are 1 275 28
against 1 275 28
the 1 275 28
Faith, 1 275 28
antisemitic 1 275 28
contents, 1 275 28
or 1 275 28
other 1 275 28
forms 1 275 28
of 1 275 28
racist 1 275 28
thought. 1 275 28

If 1 275 29
one 1 275 29
considers 1 275 29
and 1 275 29
weighs 1 275 29
this 1 275 29
matter, 1 275 29
one 1 275 29
knows: 1 275 29
one 1 275 29
may 1 275 29
not 1 275 29
bless 1 275 29
a 1 275 29
union 1 275 29
of 1 275 29
two 1 275 29
homosexual 1 275 29
men 1 275 29
or 1 275 29
of 1 275 29
lesbian 1 275 29
women. 1 275 29

Of 0 275 30
course 0 275 30
[one 0 275 30
could 0 275 30
bless] 0 275 30
two 0 275 30
men 0 275 30
or 0 275 30
women 0 275 30
who 0 275 30
are 0 275 30
de 0 275 30
facto 0 275 30
homosexual, 0 275 30
and 0 275 30
that 0 275 30
it 0 275 30
what 0 275 30
happens 0 275 30
in 0 275 30
each 0 275 30
Holy 0 275 30
Mass 0 275 30
which 0 275 30
is 0 275 30
being 0 275 30
attended 0 275 30
by 0 275 30
them. 0 275 30

This 0 275 31
blessing 0 275 31
– 0 275 31
which 0 275 31
is 0 275 31
not 0 275 31
related 0 275 31
to 0 275 31
their 0 275 31
acts 0 275 31
– 0 275 31
is 0 275 31
being 0 275 31
received 0 275 31
also 0 275 31
by 0 275 31
all 0 275 31
the 0 275 31
other 0 275 31
sinners, 0 275 31
and 0 275 31
the 0 275 31
Church 0 275 31
thereby 0 275 31
hopes 0 275 31
that 0 275 31
they 0 275 31
will 0 275 31
convert 0 275 31
under 0 275 31
the 0 275 31
influence 0 275 31
of 0 275 31
God's 0 275 31
Grace! 0 275 31

This 1 275 32
position 1 275 32
which 1 275 32
is 1 275 32
really 1 275 32
simple 1 275 32
and 1 275 32
easily 1 275 32
to 1 275 32
be 1 275 32
understood 1 275 32
has 0 275 32
been 0 275 32
clearly 0 275 32
and 0 275 32
convincingly 0 275 32
presented 0 275 32
– 0 275 32
since 0 275 32
the 0 275 32
statement 0 275 32
of 0 275 32
the 0 275 32
two 0 275 32
bishops 0 275 32
[Marx 0 275 32
and 0 275 32
Bode] 0 275 32
– 0 275 32
by 0 275 32
several 0 275 32
Christians: 0 275 32
by 0 275 32
Archbishops 0 275 32
Ludwig 0 275 32
Schick 0 275 32
(Germany) 0 275 32
and 0 275 32
Charles 0 275 32
Chaput 0 275 32
(USA); 0 275 32
by 0 275 32
the 0 275 32
German-speaking 0 275 32
theologians 0 275 32
Hubert 0 275 32
Windisch 0 275 32
and 0 275 32
Markus 0 275 32
Büning. 0 275 32

I 1 275 33
am 1 275 33
sure 1 275 33
there 1 275 33
are 1 275 33
many 1 275 33
many 1 275 33
others, 1 275 33
too, 1 275 33
who 1 275 33
think 1 275 33
alike, 1 275 33
but 1 275 33
whom 1 275 33
I 1 275 33
do 1 275 33
not 1 275 33
know. 1 275 33

Dear 1 275 34
Cardinal 1 275 34
Marx 1 275 34
and 1 275 34
dear 1 275 34
Bishop 1 275 34
Bode, 1 275 34
there 1 275 34
is 1 275 34
only 1 275 34
one 1 275 34
Catholic 1 275 34
answer: 1 275 34
No! 1 275 34

And 1 275 35
your 1 275 35
addition 1 275 35
“in 1 275 35
individual 1 275 35
cases” 1 275 35
is 1 275 35
absolutely 1 275 35
worthless, 1 275 35
it 1 275 35
has 1 275 35
no 1 275 35
argumentative 1 275 35
force. 1 275 35

What 0 275 36
would 0 275 36
St. 0 275 36
John 0 275 36
the 0 275 36
Baptist 0 275 36
have 0 275 36
said 0 275 36
if 0 275 36
Herod, 0 275 36
taking 0 275 36
for 0 275 36
himself 0 275 36
his 0 275 36
brother's 0 275 36
wife, 0 275 36
would 0 275 36
have 0 275 36
excusingly 0 275 36
called 0 275 36
himself 0 275 36
an 0 275 36
“individual 0 275 36
case”! 0 275 36

The 0 275 37
idea 0 275 37
to 0 275 37
bless 0 275 37
sinful 0 275 37
conduct 0 275 37
is 0 275 37
really 0 275 37
what 0 275 37
Isaiah 0 275 37
described 0 275 37
quite 0 275 37
vividly, 0 275 37
as 0 275 37
follows: 0 275 37
“Woe 0 275 37
to 0 275 37
you 0 275 37
that 0 275 37
call 0 275 37
evil 0 275 37
good, 0 275 37
and 0 275 37
good 0 275 37
evil: 0 275 37
that 0 275 37
put 0 275 37
darkness 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
light, 0 275 37
and 0 275 37
light 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
darkness: 0 275 37
that 0 275 37
put 0 275 37
bitter 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
sweet, 0 275 37
and 0 275 37
sweet 0 275 37
for 0 275 37
bitter.” 0 275 37
[Isaiah 0 275 37
5:20] 0 275 37

Is 0 275 38
this 0 275 38
not 0 275 38
exactly 0 275 38
what 0 275 38
Cardinal 0 275 38
Marx 0 275 38
– 0 275 38
and 0 275 38
others 0 275 38
who 0 275 38
are 0 275 38
thinking 0 275 38
like 0 275 38
him 0 275 38
– 0 275 38
are 0 275 38
doing? 0 275 38

If 0 275 39
one 0 275 39
were 0 275 39
to 0 275 39
place 0 275 39
on 0 275 39
a 0 275 39
bottle 0 275 39
of 0 275 39
sour 0 275 39
cucumbers 0 275 39
a 0 275 39
tag 0 275 39
“honey,” 0 275 39
the 0 275 39
cucumbers 0 275 39
still 0 275 39
remain 0 275 39
sour! 0 275 39

Even 0 275 40
blessing 0 275 40
bishops 0 275 40
cannot 0 275 40
change 0 275 40
that. 0 275 40

Nor 0 275 41
can 0 275 41
the 0 275 41
pope, 0 275 41
in 0 275 41
calling 0 275 41
for 0 275 41
a 0 275 41
cultural 0 275 41
revolution, 0 275 41
especially 0 275 41
since 0 275 41
he 0 275 41
does 0 275 41
not 0 275 41
explain 0 275 41
what 0 275 41
he 0 275 41
exactly 0 275 41
means 0 275 41
by 0 275 41
it. 0 275 41

He 0 275 42
says 0 275 42
that 0 275 42
he 0 275 42
“allows 0 275 42
himself” 0 275 42
to 0 275 42
talk 0 275 42
like 0 275 42
that 0 275 42
– 0 275 42
but 1 275 42
if 1 275 42
one 1 275 42
dares 1 275 42
something, 1 275 42
one 1 275 42
might 1 275 42
win, 1 275 42
but 1 275 42
one 1 275 42
also 1 275 42
can 1 275 42
perish. 1 275 42

That 0 275 43
seems 0 275 43
to 0 275 43
catch 0 275 43
on 0 275 43
these 0 275 43
days. 0 275 43

For 0 275 44
example, 0 275 44
the 0 275 44
Italian 0 275 44
moral 0 275 44
theologian, 0 275 44
Maurizio 0 275 44
Chiodi, 0 275 44
recently 0 275 44
claimed 0 275 44
in 0 275 44
his 0 275 44
talk 0 275 44
at 0 275 44
the 0 275 44
Gregorian 0 275 44
Pontifical 0 275 44
University 0 275 44
that 0 275 44
contraception 0 275 44
is 0 275 44
sometimes 0 275 44
not 0 275 44
only 0 275 44
not 0 275 44
forbidden, 0 275 44
but 0 275 44
even 0 275 44
demanded! 0 275 44

To 1 275 45
contradict 1 275 45
two 1 275 45
popes 1 275 45
– 1 275 45
whom 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
Church 1 275 45
has 1 275 45
already 1 275 45
“beatified” 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
one 1 275 45
and 1 275 45
“canonized” 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
other 1 275 45
– 1 275 45
so 1 275 45
shortly 1 275 45
after 1 275 45
their 1 275 45
deaths, 1 275 45
and 1 275 45
in 1 275 45
such 1 275 45
a 1 275 45
radical 1 275 45
and 1 275 45
open 1 275 45
manner, 1 275 45
probably 1 275 45
has 1 275 45
never 1 275 45
happened 1 275 45
before 1 275 45
in 1 275 45
the 1 275 45
Church's 1 275 45
history. 1 275 45

Isaiah 1 275 46
says 1 275 46
that 1 275 46
such 1 275 46
people 1 275 46
draw 1 275 46
unto 1 275 46
them 1 275 46
God's 1 275 46
punishment, 1 275 46
with 1 275 46
thick 1 275 46
cords! 1 275 46

Nevertheless, 0 275 47
one 0 275 47
should 0 275 47
wish 0 275 47
for 0 275 47
Cardinal 0 275 47
Marx, 0 275 47
Bishop 0 275 47
Bode, 0 275 47
and 0 275 47
Professor 0 275 47
Chiodi 0 275 47
that 0 275 47
they 0 275 47
sleep 0 275 47
well. 0 275 47

Whether 0 275 48
their 0 275 48
conscience 0 275 48
will 0 275 48
allow 0 275 48
it, 0 275 48
is 0 275 48
not 0 275 48
so 0 275 48
certain; 0 275 48
but 0 275 48
if 0 275 48
it 0 275 48
does 0 275 48
not 0 275 48
[allow 0 275 48
it], 0 275 48
it 0 275 48
would 0 275 48
certainly 0 275 48
be 0 275 48
a 0 275 48
hope 0 275 48
for 0 275 48

“This 0 278 8

But 0 278 9

he 0 278 9
hasn’t 0 278 9
considered 0 278 9

What? 0 278 12

Due 0 278 13

Wait, 0 278 14

was 0 278 14

apparently 0 278 32
doesn't 0 278 32
get 0 278 32
it. 0 278 32

I 0 278 33
want 0 278 33
my 0 278 33
White 0 278 33

So 0 278 34
does 0 278 34
Infowars. 0 278 34

Will 0 278 35

with 0 278 35
one 0 278 35
as 0 278 35
a 0 278 35
"right"? 0 278 35

Nope, 0 278 36
not 0 278 36
gonna 0 278 36
happen. 0 278 36

Because 0 278 37
it's 0 278 37
not 0 278 37
a 0 278 37
right. 0 278 37

Yet, 0 278 38
this 0 278 38

the 0 278 38

should 0 281 25

noted 0 281 25
that 0 281 25
Haig's 0 281 25

after 0 281 33
the 0 281 33

he 0 281 33
has 0 281 33
stopped 0 281 33
his 0 281 33
side 0 281 33
business. 0 281 33

It 0 281 34
wasn't 0 281 34
unusual 0 281 34
for 0 281 34
a 0 281 34
customer 0 281 34

asked 0 281 37
about 0 281 37

Haig 0 281 39
said 0 281 39
he's 0 281 39
sorry 0 281 39
that 0 281 39
the 0 281 39
massacre 0 281 39
took 0 281 39
place, 0 281 39
but 0 281 39
emphasized 0 281 39
that 0 281 39
he 0 281 39
had 0 281 39
nothing 0 281 39
to 0 281 39
do 0 281 39
with 0 281 39
Paddock's 0 281 39
mass 0 281 39
shooting. 0 281 39

“I 0 281 40
had 0 281 40
no 0 281 40
contribution 0 281 40
to 0 281 40
what 0 281 40
Paddock 0 281 40
did,” 0 281 40
Haig 0 281 40
said 0 281 40
at 0 281 40
the 0 281 40
news 0 281 40

“I 0 281 41
had 1 281 41
no 1 281 41
way 1 281 41
to 1 281 41

into 1 281 41

mind. 1 281 41

The 0 281 42
product 0 281 42
that 0 281 42
I 0 281 42

absolutely 1 281 42
nothing 1 281 42
to 1 281 42
do 1 281 42
with 0 281 42
what 0 281 42
he 0 281 42
did.” 0 281 42

Nevertheless, 0 281 43
it's 0 281 43
hard 0 281 43
to 0 281 43
believe 0 281 43
that 0 281 43
Haig's 0 281 43
denials 0 281 43
will 0 281 43
dissuade 0 281 43

the 0 284 9
burning 0 284 9

it 0 284 9
crashed, 0 284 9

Yes, 0 284 10
what 0 284 10
Kazi 0 284 10
could 0 284 10
possibly 0 284 10
have 0 284 10
been 0 284 10
up 0 284 10
to 0 284 10
is 0 284 10
a 0 284 10
complete 0 284 10
mystery. 0 284 10

The 0 284 11
Times 0 284 11
added 0 284 11
that 0 284 11
“the 0 284 11
dead 0 284 11

not 0 284 11
known 0 284 11
at 0 284 11
this 0 284 11
point, 0 284 11
said 0 284 11
Ragan, 0 284 11
who 0 284 11
debunked 0 284 11
a 0 284 11
rumor 0 284 11
that 0 284 11
some 0 284 11
sort 0 284 11
of 0 284 11
‘jihad’ 0 284 11
video 0 284 11
was 0 284 11
found 0 284 11
on 0 284 11
Kazi’s 0 284 11

All 0 284 12
right. 0 284 12

No 0 284 13
jihad 0 284 13
video. 0 284 13

And 0 284 14
no 0 284 14
“nexus 0 284 14
of 0 284 14
terrorism,” 0 284 14
according 0 284 14
to 0 284 14
Sean 0 284 14
Ragan. 0 284 14

What 0 284 15
is 0 284 15
a 0 284 15
nexus 0 284 15
of 0 284 15
terrorism? 0 284 15

Ragan 1 284 16
most 1 284 16
likely 1 284 16
means 1 284 16
that 1 284 16
investigators 1 284 16
didn’t 1 284 16
find 1 284 16
an 1 284 16
ISIS 1 284 16
membership 1 284 16
card 1 284 16
in 1 284 16
Kazi’s 1 284 16
wallet, 1 284 16
or 1 284 16
lots 1 284 16
of 1 284 16
phone 1 284 16
calls 1 284 16
to 1 284 16
Iraq 1 284 16
or 1 284 16
Syria, 1 284 16
or 1 284 16
a 1 284 16
note 1 284 16
from 1 284 16
Kazi 1 284 16
reading, 1 284 16
“I 1 284 16
did 1 284 16
this 1 284 16
for 1 284 16
Allah 1 284 16
and 1 284 16
Islam. 1 284 16

Allahu 1 284 17
akbar.” 1 284 17

Of 0 284 18
course, 0 284 18
even 0 284 18
if 0 284 18
they 0 284 18
had 0 284 18
found 0 284 18
those 0 284 18
things, 0 284 18
given 0 284 18
the 0 284 18
FBI’s 0 284 18
recent 0 284 18
track 0 284 18
record 0 284 18
of 0 284 18
denial 0 284 18
and 0 284 18
deception, 0 284 18
they 0 284 18
may 0 284 18
still 0 284 18
be 0 284 18
searching 0 284 18
for 0 284 18
Kazi’s 0 284 18
motive. 0 284 18

In 0 284 19
any 0 284 19
case, 0 284 19
a 0 284 19
larger 0 284 19
point 0 284 19
is 0 284 19
being 0 284 19
lost 0 284 19
here. 0 284 19

And 0 284 20
that 0 284 20
is 0 284 20
that 0 284 20
there 0 284 20
is 0 284 20
a 0 284 20
war 0 284 20
going 0 284 20
on. 0 284 20

We 1 284 21
know 1 284 21
that 1 284 21
the 1 284 21
Islamic 1 284 21
State, 1 284 21
al-Qaeda 1 284 21
and 1 284 21
other 1 284 21
groups 1 284 21
have 1 284 21
called 1 284 21
upon 1 284 21
Muslims 1 284 21
in 1 284 21
the 1 284 21
U.S. 1 284 21
to 1 284 21
try 1 284 21
to 1 284 21
kill 1 284 21
military 1 284 21
personnel 1 284 21
and 1 284 21
police, 1 284 21
as 1 284 21
well 1 284 21
as 1 284 21
civilians. 1 284 21

We 0 284 22
know 0 284 22
that 0 284 22
Kazi, 0 284 22
with 0 284 22
all 0 284 22
the 0 284 22
propane 0 284 22
and 0 284 22
gas 0 284 22
tanks 0 284 22
in 0 284 22
his 0 284 22
car, 0 284 22
was 0 284 22
clearly 0 284 22
trying 0 284 22
to 0 284 22
set 0 284 22
off 0 284 22
a 0 284 22
major 0 284 22
fire 0 284 22
that 0 284 22
would 0 284 22
kill 0 284 22
more 0 284 22
people 0 284 22
than 0 284 22
just 0 284 22
himself. 0 284 22

Even 0 284 23
if 0 284 23
he 0 284 23
wasn’t 0 284 23
on 0 284 23
the 0 284 23
phone 0 284 23
to 0 284 23
Baghdadi, 0 284 23
the 0 284 23
likelihood 0 284 23
is 0 284 23
that 0 284 23
when 0 284 23
a 0 284 23
Muslim 0 284 23
drives 0 284 23
into 0 284 23
a 0 284 23
U.S. 0 284 23
Air 0 284 23
Force 0 284 23
Base 0 284 23
with 0 284 23
a 0 284 23
car 0 284 23
full 0 284 23
of 0 284 23
incendiaries, 0 284 23
probably 0 284 23
this 0 284 23
has 0 284 23
something 0 284 23
to 0 284 23
do 0 284 23
with 0 284 23
the 0 284 23
global 0 284 23
jihad. 0 284 23

The 1 284 24
FBI’s 1 284 24
bafflement 1 284 24
here 1 284 24
is 1 284 24
part 1 284 24
of 1 284 24
its 1 284 24
deep, 1 284 24
deep 1 284 24
corruption. 1 284 24

The 1 284 25
FBI 1 284 25
doesn’t 1 284 25
acknowledge 1 284 25
that 1 284 25
there 1 284 25
is 1 284 25
a 1 284 25
global 1 284 25
jihad, 1 284 25
or 1 284 25
that 1 284 25
Islam 1 284 25
has 1 284 25
anything 1 284 25
to 1 284 25
do 1 284 25
with 1 284 25
terrorism. 1 284 25

It 1 284 26
doesn’t 1 284 26
admit 1 284 26
that 1 284 26
there 1 284 26
is 1 284 26
a 1 284 26
war 1 284 26
going 1 284 26
on, 1 284 26
and 1 284 26
treats 1 284 26
each 1 284 26
act 1 284 26
of 1 284 26
Islamic 1 284 26
terror 1 284 26
as 1 284 26
if 1 284 26
it 1 284 26
were 1 284 26
a 1 284 26
separate 1 284 26
and 1 284 26
discrete 1 284 26
criminal 1 284 26
event, 1 284 26
unrelated 1 284 26
to 1 284 26
all 1 284 26
the 1 284 26
others. 1 284 26

So 1 284 27
each 1 284 27
time 1 284 27
something 1 284 27
like 1 284 27
this 1 284 27
happens, 1 284 27
they’re 1 284 27
back 1 284 27
at 1 284 27
Square 1 284 27
One, 1 284 27
trying 1 284 27
to 1 284 27
figure 1 284 27
out 1 284 27
motive. 1 284 27

It’s 0 284 28
as 0 284 28
if 0 284 28
the 0 284 28
U.S. 0 284 28
Army 0 284 28
stopped 0 284 28
to 0 284 28
interrogate 0 284 28
every 0 284 28
German 0 284 28
soldier 0 284 28
who 0 284 28
crashed 0 284 28
through 0 284 28
the 0 284 28
Ardennes 0 284 28
Forest 0 284 28
at 0 284 28
the 0 284 28
beginning 0 284 28
of 0 284 28
the 0 284 28
Battle 0 284 28
of 0 284 28
the 0 284 28
Bulge 0 284 28
in 0 284 28
1944, 0 284 28
to 0 284 28
see 0 284 28
if 0 284 28
each 0 284 28
one’s 0 284 28
actions 0 284 28
had 0 284 28
anything 0 284 28
to 0 284 28
do 0 284 28
with 0 284 28
the 0 284 28
German 1 284 28
Army 1 284 28
and 1 284 28
Adolf 1 284 28
Hitler’s 1 284 28
war 0 284 28
aims. 0 284 28

Authorities 0 284 29
are 0 284 29
also 0 284 29
investigating 0 284 29
whether 0 284 29
or 0 284 29
not 0 284 29
Kazi 0 284 29
was 0 284 29
suffering 0 284 29
from 0 284 29
any 0 284 29
mental 0 284 29
health 0 284 29
issues. 0 284 29

Here 0 284 30
again, 0 284 30
this 0 284 30
is 0 284 30
just 0 284 30
more 0 284 30
of 0 284 30
the 0 284 30
general 0 284 30
refusal 0 284 30
to 0 284 30
acknowledge 0 284 30
the 1 284 30
800-pound 1 284 30
gorilla 1 284 30
sitting 0 284 30
in 0 284 30
the 0 284 30
living 0 284 30
room 0 284 30
and 0 284 30
screaming 1 284 30
“Allahu 1 284 30
akbar.” 1 284 30
Sean 0 284 30
Ragan 0 284 30
might 0 284 30
explain 0 284 30
to 0 284 30
us 0 284 30
that 0 284 30
authorities 0 284 30
are 0 284 30
also 0 284 30
trying 0 284 30
to 0 284 30
determine 0 284 30
whether 0 284 30
the 0 284 30
German 1 284 30
invasion 1 284 30
of 1 284 30
Poland 1 284 30
in 1 284 30
September 1 284 30
1939 1 284 30
was 1 284 30
motivated 1 284 30
by 1 284 30
Nazism, 1 284 30
or 0 284 30
by 0 284 30
mental 0 284 30
health 0 284 30
issues 0 284 30
among 0 284 30
the 0 284 30
German 0 284 30
High 0 284 30
Command. 0 284 30

This 0 284 31
willful 0 284 31
ignorance 0 284 31
leads 0 284 31
to 0 284 31
a 0 284 31
diversion 0 284 31
and 0 284 31
waste 0 284 31
of 0 284 31
resources 0 284 31
that 0 284 31
is 0 284 31
astronomical 1 284 31
and 1 284 31
catastrophic. 1 284 31

How 0 284 32
long 0 284 32
is 0 284 32
this 0 284 32
comic 0 284 32
opera 0 284 32
going 0 284 32
to 0 284 32
continue? 0 284 32

If 0 284 33
the 0 284 33
jihadis 0 284 33
advance 0 284 33
even 0 284 33
into 0 284 33
the 0 284 33

will 0 284 33

the 0 284 33
jihadis’ 0 284 33

even 0 284 33

that 0 285 3

Mr. 1 287 6
Ferrara, 1 287 6
however, 1 287 6
bases 1 287 6
his 1 287 6
critique 1 287 6
upon 1 287 6
an 1 287 6
assumption 1 287 6
that 1 287 6
the 1 287 6
“generous 1 287 6
response” 1 287 6
offered 1 287 6
to 1 287 6
God 1 287 6
is 1 287 6
a 1 287 6
sin. 1 287 6

This, 1 287 7
though, 1 287 7
is 1 287 7
not 1 287 7
what 1 287 7
AL 1 287 7
is 1 287 7
saying. 1 287 7

The 0 287 8
generous 0 287 8
response 0 287 8
is 0 287 8
a 0 287 8
move 0 287 8
away 0 287 8
from 0 287 8
sin 0 287 8

he 0 287 11
still 0 287 11

to 0 287 11
believe 0 287 11
that 0 287 11
AL 0 287 11

In 0 287 12

2016 0 287 12
article 0 287 12
in 0 287 12
Catholic 0 287 12
World 0 287 12

Brugger 0 287 12
writes 0 287 12
that 0 287 12
AL 0 287 12
303 0 287 12
suggests 0 287 12
that 0 287 12
“God 0 287 12
can 0 287 12
be 0 287 12
‘asking’ 0 287 12
someone 0 287 12

live 0 287 12
in 0 287 12
a 0 287 12

in 0 287 12
which 0 287 12
they 0 287 12
are 0 287 12
objectively 0 287 12
violating 0 287 12
grave 0 287 12
matter.” 0 287 12
Then 0 287 12
in 0 287 12
a 0 287 12
Sept. 0 287 12
28 0 287 12
‘17 0 287 12
LifeSiteNews 0 287 12
article, 0 287 12
he 0 287 12
states 0 287 12
that 0 287 12
“the 0 287 12
generous 0 287 12
response” 0 287 12
owed 0 287 12
to 0 287 12
God 0 287 12
is 0 287 12
“a 0 287 12
certain 0 287 12
state 0 287 12
that 0 287 12
is 0 287 12

at 0 287 12

with 0 287 12
the 0 287 12
universal 0 287 12
command 0 287 12
of 0 287 12
the 0 287 12
Gospel.” 0 287 12
Now 0 287 12
Prof. 0 287 12
Brugger 0 287 12
argues 0 287 12
that, 0 287 12
because 0 287 12
the 0 287 12
subject 0 287 12
remains 0 287 12
“this 0 287 12
conscience” 0 287 12
in 0 287 12
AL 0 287 12
303, 0 287 12
this 0 287 12
proves 0 287 12
that 0 287 12
the 0 287 12
“generous 0 287 12
offering 0 287 12
owed 0 287 12
to 0 287 12
God” 0 287 12
is 0 287 12
the 0 287 12
recognition 0 287 12
that 0 287 12
one 0 287 12
is 0 287 12
living 0 287 12
“contrary 0 287 12
to 0 287 12
“the 0 287 12
universal 0 287 12
command 0 287 12
of 0 287 12
the 0 287 12
Gospel.” 0 287 12

Prof. 0 287 13
Brugger 0 287 13
fails 0 287 13
to 0 287 13
see 0 287 13
that 0 287 13
AL 0 287 13
303 0 287 13
clearly 0 287 13
distinguishes 0 287 13
between 0 287 13
a 0 287 13
conscience’s 0 287 13
recognition 0 287 13
that 0 287 13
“a 0 287 13
given 0 287 13
situation 0 287 13
is 0 287 13
objectively 0 287 13
at 0 287 13
variance 0 287 13
with 0 287 13
the 0 287 13
general 0 287 13
mandate 0 287 13
of 0 287 13
the 0 287 13
Gospel” 0 287 13
and 0 287 13
this 0 287 13
same 0 287 13
conscience’s 0 287 13
subsequent 0 287 13
recognition 0 287 13
of 0 287 13
a 0 287 13
“generous 0 287 13
response 0 287 13
owed 0 287 13
to 0 287 13
God 0 287 13
in 0 287 13
the 0 287 13
present 0 287 13
circumstances.” 0 287 13
The 0 287 13
subject 0 287 13
“conscience” 0 287 13
might 0 287 13
be 0 287 13
the 0 287 13
same 0 287 13
but 0 287 13
the 0 287 13
object 0 287 13
is 0 287 13
different. 0 287 13

The 0 287 14
“generous 0 287 14
response” 0 287 14
is 0 287 14
not 0 287 14
the 0 287 14
situation 0 287 14
that 0 287 14
is 0 287 14
at 0 287 14
variance 0 287 14
with 0 287 14
the 0 287 14
command 0 287 14
of 0 287 14
the 0 287 14
Gospel 0 287 14
but 0 287 14
an 0 287 14
offering 0 287 14
that 0 287 14
God 0 287 14
is 0 287 14
asking 0 287 14
amid 0 287 14
the 0 287 14
mass 0 287 14
of 0 287 14
impediments 0 287 14
even 0 287 14
though 0 287 14
it 0 287 14
may 0 287 14
not 0 287 14
yet 0 287 14
be 0 287 14
the 0 287 14
perfect 0 287 14
objective 0 287 14
model. 0 287 14

What 0 287 15
might 0 287 15
be 0 287 15
this 0 287 15
“generous 0 287 15
response?” 0 287 15
Pope 0 287 15
Francis 0 287 15
does 0 287 15
not 0 287 15
give 0 287 15
an 0 287 15
example 0 287 15
in 0 287 15
AL 0 287 15
303 0 287 15
because 0 287 15
he’s 0 287 15
speaking 0 287 15
in 0 287 15
general 0 287 15
terms 0 287 15
of 0 287 15
the 0 287 15
dynamics 0 287 15
of 0 287 15
conscience. 0 287 15

Moreover, 0 287 16
he 0 287 16
knows 0 287 16
that 0 287 16
concrete 0 287 16
cases 0 287 16
vary 0 287 16
widely. 0 287 16

In 0 287 17
our 0 287 17
Sept. 0 287 17
26 0 287 17
article 0 287 17
in 0 287 17
La 0 287 17
Stampa, 0 287 17
Dr. 0 287 17
Goldstein 0 287 17
and 0 287 17
I 0 287 17
provided 0 287 17
a 0 287 17
hypothetical 0 287 17
example 0 287 17
of 0 287 17
a 0 287 17
couple 0 287 17
in 0 287 17
a 0 287 17
purely 0 287 17
civil 0 287 17
“marriage” 0 287 17
recognizing 0 287 17
that 0 287 17
God 0 287 17
is 0 287 17
calling 0 287 17
them 0 287 17
to 0 287 17
live 0 287 17
in 0 287 17
continence. 0 287 17

We 0 287 18
chose 0 287 18
this 0 287 18
example 0 287 18
deliberately 0 287 18
to 0 287 18
demonstrate 0 287 18
that 0 287 18
“the 0 287 18
generous 0 287 18
response” 0 287 18
could 0 287 18
be 0 287 18
the 0 287 18
ending 0 287 18
of 0 287 18
a 0 287 18
particular 0 287 18
sin. 0 287 18

Our 0 287 19
example 0 287 19
was 0 287 19
an 0 287 19
attempt 0 287 19
to 0 287 19
show 0 287 19
that 0 287 19
Professors 0 287 19
Brugger 0 287 19
and 0 287 19
Seifert 0 287 19
are 0 287 19
wrong 0 287 19
to 0 287 19
believe 0 287 19
AL 0 287 19
303 0 287 19
implies 0 287 19
that 0 287 19
God 0 287 19
is 0 287 19
asking 0 287 19
some 0 287 19
people 0 287 19
to 0 287 19
continue 0 287 19
to 0 287 19
live 0 287 19
in 0 287 19
an 0 287 19
objectively 0 287 19
sinful 0 287 19
state. 0 287 19

It’s 0 287 20
really 0 287 20
just 0 287 20
the 0 287 20
opposite. 0 287 20

AL 0 287 21
303 0 287 21
teaches 0 287 21
that 0 287 21
conscience 0 287 21
will 0 287 21
come 0 287 21
to 0 287 21
recognize 0 287 21
that 0 287 21
God 0 287 21
is 0 287 21
asking 0 287 21
for 0 287 21
a 0 287 21
step 0 287 21
in 0 287 21
the 0 287 21

Pope 1 287 22
Francis 1 287 22
explains 1 287 22
this 1 287 22
again 1 287 22
in 1 287 22
AL 1 287 22
305 1 287 22
when 1 287 22
he 1 287 22
says 1 287 22
“a 1 287 22
small 1 287 22
step, 1 287 22
in 1 287 22
the 1 287 22
midst 1 287 22
of 1 287 22
great 1 287 22
human 1 287 22
limitations, 1 287 22
can 1 287 22
be 1 287 22
more 1 287 22
pleasing 1 287 22
to 1 287 22
God 1 287 22
than 1 287 22
a 1 287 22
life 1 287 22
which 1 287 22
appears 1 287 22
outwardly 1 287 22
in 1 287 22
order, 1 287 22
but 0 287 22
moves 0 287 22
through 0 287 22
the 0 287 22
day 0 287 22
without 0 287 22
confronting 0 287 22
great 0 287 22
difficulties.’” 0 287 22

In 0 287 23
a 0 287 23
recent 0 287 23
interview 0 287 23
(http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., 0 287 23
the 0 287 23
Italian 0 287 23
philosopher, 0 287 23
Rocco 0 287 23
Buttiglione, 0 287 23
provides 0 287 23
this 0 287 23
example 0 287 23
for 0 287 23
AL 0 287 23
303: 0 287 23
“Imagine 0 287 23
a 0 287 23
father 0 287 23
who 0 287 23
has 0 287 23
a 0 287 23
sick 0 287 23
son 0 287 23
and 0 287 23
the 0 287 23
child 0 287 23
improves. 0 287 23

He 0 287 24
still 0 287 24
has 0 287 24
fever 0 287 24
but 0 287 24
has 0 287 24
stopped 0 287 24
vomiting; 0 287 24
the 0 287 24
child 0 287 24
manages 0 287 24
to 0 287 24
keep 0 287 24
in 0 287 24
his 0 287 24
stomach 0 287 24
what 0 287 24
he 0 287 24
eats 0 287 24
and 0 287 24
has 0 287 24
started 0 287 24
a 0 287 24
therapy 0 287 24
that 0 287 24
seems 0 287 24
to 0 287 24
work. 0 287 24

The 0 287 25
father 0 287 25
is 0 287 25
happy. 0 287 25

Is 0 287 26
he 0 287 26
happy 0 287 26
about 0 287 26
the 0 287 26
fact 0 287 26
that 0 287 26
the 0 287 26
child 0 287 26
is 0 287 26
sick? 0 287 26

No, 0 287 27
he 0 287 27
is 0 287 27
pleased 0 287 27
that 0 287 27
his 0 287 27
son 0 287 27
gives 0 287 27
symptoms 0 287 27
of 0 287 27
improvement 0 287 27
and 0 287 27
healing.” 0 287 27

This 0 287 28
is 0 287 28
what 0 287 28
Pope 0 287 28
Francis 0 287 28
is 0 287 28
saying 0 287 28
in 0 287 28
AL 0 287 28
303. 0 287 28

God 0 287 29
is 0 287 29
not 0 287 29
happy 0 287 29
with 0 287 29
situations 0 287 29
that 0 287 29
are 0 287 29
objectively 0 287 29
at 0 287 29
variance 0 287 29
with 0 287 29
the 0 287 29
command 0 287 29
of 0 287 29
the 0 287 29
Gospel. 0 287 29

God, 0 287 30
however, 0 287 30
is 0 287 30
happy 0 287 30
when 0 287 30
people 0 287 30
in 0 287 30
such 0 287 30
situations 0 287 30
discern 0 287 30
in 0 287 30
conscience 0 287 30
that 0 287 30
He 0 287 30
is 0 287 30
asking 0 287 30
them 0 287 30
to 0 287 30
make 0 287 30
a 0 287 30
choice 0 287 30
that 0 287 30
moves 0 287 30
in 0 287 30
the 0 287 30
right 0 287 30
direction—even 0 287 30
if 0 287 30
they 0 287 30
still 0 287 30
need 0 287 30
to 0 287 30
progress 0 287 30
further 0 287 30
toward 0 287 30
a 0 287 30
more 0 287 30
complete 0 287 30
fulfillment 0 287 30
of 0 287 30
His 0 287 30
will. 0 287 30

This 0 287 31
is 0 287 31
the 0 287 31
law 0 287 31
of 0 287 31
gradualness 0 287 31
not 0 287 31
the 0 287 31
gradualness 0 287 31
of 0 287 31
the 0 287 31
law. 0 287 31

It 0 287 32
is 0 287 32
sad 0 287 32
that 0 287 32
this 0 287 32
beautiful 0 287 32
and 0 287 32
compassionate 0 287 32
message 0 287 32
of 0 287 32
AL 0 287 32
303 0 287 32
has 0 287 32
been 0 287 32
so 0 287 32
completely 0 287 32
misunderstood 0 287 32
by 0 287 32
scholars 0 287 32
who 0 287 32
have 0 287 32
failed 0 287 32
to 0 287 32
grasp 0 287 32
its 0 287 32
true 0 287 32
meaning. 0 287 32

I 0 287 34
certainly 0 287 34
agree 0 287 34
that 0 287 34
the 0 287 34
Latin 0 287 34
text 0 287 34
is 0 287 34
the 0 287 34
normative 0 287 34
text 0 287 34
even 0 287 34
if 0 287 34
it 0 287 34
comes 0 287 34
later. 0 287 34

I 0 287 35
certainly 0 287 35
do 0 287 35
not 0 287 35
agree 0 287 35
that 0 287 35
the 0 287 35
Latin 0 287 35
text 0 287 35
eliminates 0 287 35
the 0 287 35
grave 0 287 35
problems 0 287 35
with 0 287 35
Amoris 0 287 35
Laetitia. 0 287 35

Rather, 0 287 36
as 0 287 36
I 0 287 36
show 0 287 36
in 0 287 36
my 0 287 36
article, 0 287 36
it 0 287 36
only 0 287 36
intensifies 0 287 36
them. 0 287 36

With 1 287 37
all 1 287 37
due 1 287 37
respect 1 287 37
to 1 287 37
Dr. 1 287 37
Fastiggi, 1 287 37
his 1 287 37
argument 1 287 37
and 1 287 37
that 1 287 37
of 1 287 37
Buttiglione, 1 287 37
that 1 287 37
a 1 287 37
“move 1 287 37
away 1 287 37
from 1 287 37
sin” 1 287 37
is 1 287 37
what 1 287 37
is 1 287 37
pleasing 1 287 37
to 1 287 37
God, 1 287 37
even 1 287 37
if 1 287 37
the 1 287 37
moral 1 287 37
norm 1 287 37
is 1 287 37
not 1 287 37
adhered 1 287 37
to, 1 287 37
is 1 287 37
sophistical. 1 287 37

What 0 287 38
constitutes 0 287 38
a 0 287 38
“move 0 287 38
away” 0 287 38
from 0 287 38
sin 0 287 38
if 0 287 38
not 0 287 38
ceasing 0 287 38
to 0 287 38
commit 0 287 38
the 0 287 38
sin? 0 287 38

No 0 287 39
example 0 287 39
is 0 287 39
provided 0 287 39
in 0 287 39
AL 0 287 39
because 0 287 39
none 0 287 39
can 0 287 39
be. 0 287 39

The 0 287 40
notion 0 287 40
is 0 287 40
nonsensical. 0 287 40

Just 0 287 41
how 0 287 41
nonsensical 0 287 41
is 0 287 41
demonstrated 0 287 41
by 0 287 41
Dr. 0 287 41
Fastiggi’s 0 287 41
claim 0 287 41
that 0 287 41
by 0 287 41
“a 0 287 41
move 0 287 41
away 0 287 41
from 0 287 41
sin” 0 287 41
in 0 287 41
the 0 287 41
case 0 287 41
of 0 287 41
a 0 287 41
divorced 0 287 41
and 0 287 41
“remarried” 0 287 41
couple 0 287 41
Francis 0 287 41
means 0 287 41
their 0 287 41
agreement 0 287 41
to 0 287 41
live 0 287 41
in 0 287 41
continence 0 287 41
as 0 287 41
brother 0 287 41
and 0 287 41
sister 0 287 41
for 0 287 41
the 0 287 41
sake 0 287 41
of 0 287 41
children. 0 287 41

But 0 287 42
that 0 287 42
would 0 287 42
be 0 287 42
ceasing 0 287 42
to 0 287 42
commit 0 287 42
the 0 287 42
sin 0 287 42
of 0 287 42
adultery 0 287 42
altogether 0 287 42
as 0 287 42
it 0 287 42
would 0 287 42
involve 0 287 42
abandoning 0 287 42
the 0 287 42
pretense 0 287 42
that 0 287 42
they 0 287 42
are 0 287 42
married 0 287 42
along 0 287 42
with 0 287 42
the 0 287 42
illicit 0 287 42
sexual 0 287 42
relation 0 287 42
itself. 0 287 42

Such 0 287 43
a 0 287 43
couple 0 287 43
could 0 287 43
always 0 287 43
be 0 287 43
absolved 0 287 43
and 0 287 43
receive 0 287 43
Holy 0 287 43
Communion 0 287 43
under 0 287 43
the 0 287 43
Church’s 0 287 43
constant 0 287 43
practice, 0 287 43
albeit 0 287 43
privately 0 287 43
to 0 287 43
avoid 0 287 43
scandal. 0 287 43

At 0 287 44
any 0 287 44
rate, 0 287 44
the 0 287 44
“brother 0 287 44
and 0 287 44
sister” 0 287 44
approach 0 287 44
to 0 287 44
the 0 287 44
situation, 0 287 44
which 0 287 44
is 0 287 44
that 0 287 44
of 0 287 44
Familiaris 0 287 44
consortio 0 287 44
84, 0 287 44
is 0 287 44
certainly 0 287 44
not 0 287 44
the 0 287 44
one 0 287 44
advocated 0 287 44
by 0 287 44
Francis. 0 287 44

As 0 287 45
my 0 287 45
article 0 287 45
shows, 0 287 45
Francis 0 287 45
has 0 287 45
made 0 287 45
it 0 287 45
quite 0 287 45
clear 0 287 45
that 0 287 45
he 0 287 45
approves 0 287 45
of 0 287 45
admitting 0 287 45
to 0 287 45
the 0 287 45
sacraments 0 287 45
divorced 0 287 45
and 0 287 45
“remarried” 0 287 45
people 0 287 45
who 0 287 45
will 0 287 45
continue 0 287 45
to 0 287 45
live 0 287 45
as 0 287 45
if 0 287 45
they 0 287 45
were 0 287 45
married, 0 287 45
including 0 287 45
sexual 0 287 45
relations, 0 287 45
while 0 287 45
“discerning” 0 287 45
their 0 287 45
situation, 0 287 45
this 0 287 45
“discernment” 0 287 45
being 0 287 45
a 0 287 45
mere 0 287 45
fig 0 287 45
leaf 0 287 45
to 0 287 45
conceal 0 287 45
the 0 287 45
proposed 0 287 45
toleration 0 287 45
of 0 287 45
public 0 287 45
adultery 0 287 45
in 0 287 45
the 0 287 45
Church. 0 287 45

Thus, 0 287 46
Francis 0 287 46
thanked 0 287 46
the 0 287 46
Maltese 0 287 46
bishops 0 287 46
for 0 287 46
their 0 287 46
AL 0 287 46
guidelines, 0 287 46
which 0 287 46
literally 0 287 46
mandate 0 287 46
admission 0 287 46
to 0 287 46
the 0 287 46
sacraments 0 287 46
of 0 287 46
divorced 0 287 46
and 0 287 46
“remarried” 0 287 46
people 0 287 46
who 0 287 46
believe 0 287 46
themselves 0 287 46
to 0 287 46
be 0 287 46
“at 0 287 46
peace 0 287 46
with 0 287 46
God.” 0 287 46
And, 0 287 46
as 0 287 46
he 0 287 46
told 0 287 46
the 0 287 46
bishops 0 287 46
of 0 287 46
Buenos 0 287 46
Aires 0 287 46
in 0 287 46
writing, 0 287 46
“there 0 287 46
is 0 287 46
no 0 287 46
other 0 287 46
interpretation.” 0 287 46

No 0 287 47
amount 0 287 47
of 0 287 47
verbal 0 287 47
artifice 0 287 47
can 0 287 47
conceal 0 287 47
what 0 287 47
is 0 287 47
happening 0 287 47
in 0 287 47
the 0 287 47
Church 0 287 47
thanks 0 287 47
to 0 287 47
AL: 0 287 47
Public 0 287 47
adulterers 0 287 47
are 0 287 47
being 0 287 47
admitted 0 287 47
to 0 287 47
Holy 0 287 47
Communion 0 287 47
without 0 287 47
an 0 287 47
amendment 0 287 47
of 0 287 47
life 0 287 47
and 0 287 47
the 0 287 47
bimillenial 0 287 47
discipline 0 287 47
of 0 287 47
the 0 287 47
Church---which 0 287 47
John 0 287 47
Paul 0 287 47
insisted 0 287 47
involves 0 287 47
a 0 287 47
moral 0 287 47
norm, 0 287 47
not 0 287 47
a 0 287 47
mere 0 287 47
ecclesiastical 0 287 47
law, 0 287 47
to 0 287 47
which 0 287 47
everyone 0 287 47
is 0 287 47
bound 0 287 47
in 0 287 47
conscience 0 287 47
“without 0 287 47
exception”---is 0 287 47
being 0 287 47
overthrown 0 287 47
in 0 287 47
place 0 287 47
after 0 287 47
place. 0 287 47

It 0 287 48
is 0 287 48
a 0 287 48
great 0 287 48
disservice 0 287 48
to 0 287 48
the 0 287 48
Church 0 287 48
to 0 287 48
maintain 0 287 48
the 0 287 48
pretense 0 287 48
that 0 287 48
there 0 287 48
is 0 287 48
nothing 0 287 48
problematical 0 287 48
about 0 287 48
AL. 0 287 48

A 1 287 49
moral 1 287 49
catastrophe 1 287 49
is 1 287 49
self-evidently 1 287 49

Thank 0 287 51
you 0 287 51

your 0 287 51
response. 0 287 51

You 0 287 52
write 0 287 52
well 0 287 52
but 0 287 52
you 0 287 52
do 0 287 52
not 0 287 52
reveal 0 287 52
a 0 287 52

of 0 287 52

I 0 287 53
can 0 287 53
only 0 287 53
ask 0 287 53
that 0 287 53
you 0 287 53

like 0 287 60
to 0 287 60
thank 0 287 60
Christopher 0 287 60
Ferrara 0 287 60
again 0 287 60
for 0 287 60
calling 0 287 60
attention 0 287 60
to 0 287 60
an 0 287 60
article 0 287 60
I 0 287 60
co-authored 0 287 60
with 0 287 60
Dr. 0 287 60
Goldstein 0 287 60
in 0 287 60
La 0 287 60

I 0 287 61
give 0 287 61
him 0 287 61
credit 0 287 61
for 0 287 61
his 0 287 61
colorful 0 287 61
style. 0 287 61

Unfortunately, 0 287 62
Mr. 0 287 62
Ferrara 0 287 62
provides 0 287 62
no 0 287 62
real 0 287 62
evidence 0 287 62
for 0 287 62
his 0 287 62
claim 0 287 62
that 0 287 62
Pope 0 287 62
Francis 0 287 62
“wishes 0 287 62
the 0 287 62
bishops 0 287 62

continuing 0 287 62
their 0 287 62

He 1 287 63
mentions 1 287 63
the 1 287 63
Holy 1 287 63
Father's 1 287 63
letter 1 287 63
to 1 287 63
the 1 287 63
Buenos 1 287 63
Aires 1 287 63
bishops, 1 287 63
but 1 287 63
he 1 287 63
fails 1 287 63
to 1 287 63
take 1 287 63
into 1 287 63
account 1 287 63
that 1 287 63
the 1 287 63
statement 1 287 63
of 1 287 63
those 1 287 63
Argentine 1 287 63
bishops 1 287 63
can 1 287 63
be 1 287 63
interpreted 1 287 63
in 1 287 63
an 1 287 63
orthodox 1 287 63
way, 1 287 63
as 0 287 63
Cardinal 0 287 63
Müller 0 287 63
told 0 287 63
Edward 0 287 63
Pentin 0 287 63
in 0 287 63
a 0 287 63
Sept. 0 287 63
28 0 287 63
interview 0 287 63
published 0 287 63
in 0 287 63
the 0 287 63
National 0 287 63
Catholic 0 287 63
Register. 0 287 63

In 0 287 64
fact 0 287 64
the 0 287 64
statement 0 287 64
of 0 287 64
the 0 287 64
Argentine 0 287 64
bishops 0 287 64
only 0 287 64
speaks 0 287 64
of 0 287 64
the 0 287 64
possibility 0 287 64
of 0 287 64
“access 0 287 64
to 0 287 64
the 0 287 64
sacraments 0 287 64
of 0 287 64
Reconciliation 0 287 64
and 0 287 64
the 0 287 64
Eucharist.” 0 287 64
This 0 287 64
could 0 287 64
reasonably 0 287 64
be 0 287 64
interpreted 0 287 64
as 0 287 64
going 0 287 64
to 0 287 64
confession 0 287 64
before 0 287 64
receiving 0 287 64
Holy 0 287 64
Communion. 0 287 64

The 0 287 65
same 0 287 65
applies 0 287 65
to 0 287 65
statements 0 287 65
of 0 287 65
Pope 0 287 65
Francis 0 287 65
and 0 287 65
Cardinal 0 287 65

Pope 0 287 66
Francis 0 287 66
defers 0 287 66

exposition 0 287 66

laetitia 0 287 66

given 0 287 66
in 0 287 66
April 0 287 66
2016 0 287 66
when 0 287 66
the 0 287 66
exhortation 0 287 66
was 0 287 66
made 0 287 66
public. 0 287 66

I 1 287 67
have 1 287 67
read 1 287 67
the 1 287 67
Cardinal's 1 287 67
exposition 1 287 67
in 1 287 67
both 1 287 67
Italian 1 287 67
and 1 287 67
English, 1 287 67
and 1 287 67
I 1 287 67
only 1 287 67
find 1 287 67
mention 1 287 67
of 1 287 67
the 1 287 67
help 1 287 67
of 1 287 67
the 1 287 67
sacraments 1 287 67
in 1 287 67
certain 1 287 67
cases. 1 287 67

Once 0 287 68
again, 0 287 68
Mr. 0 287 68
Ferrara 0 287 68
assumes 0 287 68
this 0 287 68
means 0 287 68
access 0 287 68
to 0 287 68
Holy 0 287 68
Communion 0 287 68
without 0 287 68
prior 0 287 68
sacramental 0 287 68
confession. 0 287 68

With 0 287 69
regard 0 287 69
to 0 287 69
the 0 287 69
letter 0 287 69
thanking 0 287 69
the 0 287 69
Bishops 0 287 69
of 0 287 69
Malta, 0 287 69
it 0 287 69
should 0 287 69
be 0 287 69
noted 0 287 69
that 0 287 69
Edward 0 287 69
Pentin 0 287 69
mentions 0 287 69
a 0 287 69
letter 0 287 69
of 0 287 69
Cardinal 0 287 69
Baldiserri 0 287 69
not 0 287 69
a 0 287 69
letter 0 287 69
of 0 287 69
Pope 0 287 69
Francis. 0 287 69

Moreover, 0 287 70
this 0 287 70
letter 0 287 70
has 0 287 70
not 0 287 70
been 0 287 70
made 0 287 70
public 0 287 70
so 0 287 70
we 0 287 70
don't 0 287 70
know 0 287 70
exactly 0 287 70
what 0 287 70
it 0 287 70
says 0 287 70
other 0 287 70
than 0 287 70
an 0 287 70
expression 0 287 70
of 0 287 70
thanks. 0 287 70

This 0 287 71
seems 0 287 71
to 0 287 71
be 0 287 71
very 0 287 71
thin 0 287 71
evidence 0 287 71
for 0 287 71
claiming 0 287 71
Pope 0 287 71
Francis 0 287 71
wishes 0 287 71
the 0 287 71
bishops 0 287 71
to 0 287 71
admit 0 287 71
public 0 287 71
adulterers 0 287 71
to 0 287 71
the 0 287 71
sacraments 0 287 71
while 0 287 71
continuing 0 287 71
in 0 287 71
their 0 287 71
adulterous 0 287 71
relations. 0 287 71

As 0 287 72
a 0 287 72
lawyer, 0 287 72
Ferrara 0 287 72
should 0 287 72
have 0 287 72
a 0 287 72
better 0 287 72
sense 0 287 72
of 0 287 72
what 0 287 72
really 0 287 72
counts 0 287 72
as 0 287 72
evidence. 0 287 72

As 0 287 73
a 0 287 73
Christian, 0 287 73
he 0 287 73
should 0 287 73
also 0 287 73
be 0 287 73
mindful 0 287 73
of 0 287 73
the 0 287 73
command 0 287 73
against 0 287 73
bearing 0 287 73
false 0 287 73
witness. 0 287 73

Beyond 0 287 74
these 0 287 74
considerations, 0 287 74
I 0 287 74
wish 0 287 74
to 0 287 74
express 0 287 74
a 0 287 74
personal 0 287 74
concern 0 287 74
I 0 287 74
have 0 287 74
about 0 287 74
Mr. 0 287 74
Ferrara's 0 287 74
standing 0 287 74
in 0 287 74
the 0 287 74
Catholic 0 287 74
Church. 0 287 74

He 0 287 75
says 0 287 75
that 0 287 75
Dr. 0 287 75
Goldstein 0 287 75
and 0 287 75
I 0 287 75
are 0 287 75
“foot 1 287 75
soldiers 1 287 75
of 1 287 75
a 1 287 75
Leviathan 1 287 75
Church” 1 287 75
because 0 287 75
we 0 287 75
defend 0 287 75
the 0 287 75
Roman 0 287 75
Pontiff. 0 287 75

Does 1 287 76
Mr. 1 287 76
Ferrara 1 287 76
believe 1 287 76
that 1 287 76
the 1 287 76
Catholic 1 287 76
Church 1 287 76
under 1 287 76
Pope 1 287 76
Francis 1 287 76
is 1 287 76
a 1 287 76
“Leviathan 1 287 76
Church” 1 287 76
and 1 287 76
not 1 287 76
the 1 287 76
Catholic 1 287 76
Church? 1 287 76

If 1 287 77
this 1 287 77
is 1 287 77
so, 1 287 77
then 1 287 77
it 1 287 77
would 1 287 77
suggest 1 287 77
that 1 287 77
Mr. 1 287 77
Ferrara 1 287 77
is 1 287 77
refusing 1 287 77
submission 1 287 77
to 1 287 77
the 1 287 77
Roman 1 287 77
Pontiff 1 287 77
and 1 287 77
communion 1 287 77
with 1 287 77
the 1 287 77
members 1 287 77
of 1 287 77
the 1 287 77
Church 1 287 77
subject 1 287 77
to 1 287 77
him. 1 287 77

This, 0 287 78
though, 0 287 78
is 0 287 78
the 0 287 78
very 0 287 78
definition 0 287 78
of 0 287 78
schism 0 287 78
found 0 287 78
in 0 287 78
the 0 287 78
Catechism 0 287 78
of 0 287 78
the 0 287 78
Catholic 0 287 78
Church, 0 287 78
2089 0 287 78
and 0 287 78
the 0 287 78
1983 0 287 78
CIC 0 287 78
canon 0 287 78
751. 0 287 78

I 0 287 79
hope 0 287 79
Mr. 0 287 79
Ferrara 0 287 79
can 0 287 79
clarify 0 287 79
what 0 287 79
he 0 287 79
means 0 287 79
by 0 287 79
the 0 287 79
“Leviathan 0 287 79
Church” 0 287 79
under 0 287 79
Pope 0 287 79
Francis. 0 287 79

A 0 287 80
more 0 287 80
simple 0 287 80
question 0 287 80
to 0 287 80
him 0 287 80
would 0 287 80
be 0 287 80
this: 0 287 80
“Are 0 287 80
you 0 287 80
refusing 0 287 80
submission 0 287 80
to 0 287 80
the 0 287 80
Roman 0 287 80
Pontiff 0 287 80
or 0 287 80
communion 0 287 80
with 0 287 80
the 0 287 80
members 0 287 80
subject 0 287 80
to 0 287 80
him?” 0 287 80

I 0 287 81
apologize 0 287 81
ahead 0 287 81
of 0 287 81
time 0 287 81
if 0 287 81
I 0 287 81
misconstrued 0 287 81
his 0 287 81
words. 0 287 81

I 0 287 82
believe, 0 287 82
though, 0 287 82
my 0 287 82
question 0 287 82
is 0 287 82
reasonable 0 287 82
in 0 287 82
light 0 287 82
of 0 287 82
his 0 287 82
reference 0 287 82
to 0 287 82
a 0 287 82
“Leviathan 0 287 82
Church” 0 287 82
distinct 0 287 82
from 0 287 82
“the 0 287 82
dictates 0 287 82
of 0 287 82

If 0 287 84
Dr. 0 287 84
Fastiggi 0 287 84
wishes 0 287 84
to 0 287 84
continue 0 287 84
to 0 287 84
pretend, 0 287 84
despite 0 287 84
a 0 287 84
growing 0 287 84
mountain 0 287 84
of 0 287 84
evidence, 0 287 84
that 0 287 84
Pope 0 287 84
Francis 0 287 84
has 0 287 84
not 0 287 84
in 0 287 84
fact 0 287 84
approved 0 287 84
of 0 287 84
the 0 287 84

of 0 287 84
public 0 287 84
adulterers 0 287 84
to 0 287 84
Holy 0 287 84
Communion--just 0 287 84
as 0 287 84
he 0 287 84
did 0 287 84
when 0 287 84
Archbishop 0 287 84
of 0 287 84
Buenos 0 287 84
Aires, 0 287 84
and 0 287 84
just 0 287 84
as 0 287 84
he 0 287 84
did 0 287 84
with 0 287 84
the 0 287 84
woman 0 287 84
he 0 287 84
telephoned 0 287 84
in 0 287 84
Argentina—then 0 287 84
I 0 287 84
cannot 0 287 84
help 0 287 84
him. 0 287 84

As 0 287 85
for 0 287 85
my 0 287 85

reference 0 287 85
to 0 287 85
a 0 287 85
“Leviathan 0 287 85

I 0 287 85
am 0 287 85
afraid 0 287 85
Dr. 1 287 85
Fastiggi 1 287 85
has 1 287 85
succumbed 1 287 85
to 1 287 85
an 1 287 85
unfortunate 1 287 85
literal-mindedness. 1 287 85

To 0 287 86
make 0 287 86
it 0 287 86
clear 0 287 86
for 0 287 86
him, 0 287 86
I 0 287 86
am 0 287 86
contending 0 287 86
that 0 287 86
he 0 287 86
and 0 287 86
his 0 287 86
co-author 0 287 86
treat 0 287 86
the 0 287 86
Pope 0 287 86
as 0 287 86
if 0 287 86
he 0 287 86
were 0 287 86
the 0 287 86
absolute 0 287 86
ruler 0 287 86
of 0 287 86
Hobbes’s 0 287 86
Leviathan. 0 287 86

I 0 287 87
do 0 287 87
not, 0 287 87
as 0 287 87
should 0 287 87
be 0 287 87
obvious, 0 287 87
argue 0 287 87
that 0 287 87
this 0 287 87
Leviathan 0 287 87
Church 0 287 87
actually 0 287 87
exists. 0 287 87

That 0 287 88
it 0 287 88
does 0 287 88
not 0 287 88
and 0 287 88
cannot 0 287 88
exist 0 287 88
is 0 287 88
precisely 0 287 88
my 0 287 88

a 1 287 89
pronounced 1 287 89

of 1 287 89

pertinent 1 287 89

theological 1 287 89

a 1 287 89
rather 1 287 89
embarrassing 1 287 89
lack 1 287 89
of 1 287 89

objections 0 287 90
to 0 287 90

This 0 290 7
plan 0 290 7
has 0 290 7
included 0 290 7
the 0 290 7
establishment 0 290 7

way 0 290 7

Syria’s 0 290 7
Mediterranean 0 290 7

makes 0 290 8
Iran’s 0 290 8
job 0 290 8
easier 0 290 8
in 0 290 8
supplying 0 290 8

President 0 290 8
Bashar 0 290 8

Syria 0 290 8
in 0 290 8
support 0 290 8
of 0 290 8
Assad. 0 290 8

This 0 290 9
helps 0 290 9
explain 0 290 9
why 0 290 9
Iran 0 290 9
has 0 290 9
placed 0 290 9
so 0 290 9
much 0 290 9
importance 0 290 9
on 0 290 9
helping 0 290 9
the 0 290 9
Syrian 0 290 9
regime 0 290 9
establish 0 290 9

“It’s 1 290 14
a 1 290 14
new 1 290 14
monster.” 1 290 14

Furthermore, 0 290 15
Iran 0 290 15
has 0 290 15
funded 0 290 15
and 0 290 15
armed 0 290 15
its 0 290 15
terrorist 0 290 15
proxy 0 290 15
Hezbollah, 0 290 15
which 0 290 15
has 0 290 15
sent 0 290 15
its 0 290 15
militia 0 290 15
from 0 290 15
its 0 290 15
home 0 290 15
base 0 290 15
of 0 290 15
Lebanon 0 290 15
to 0 290 15
fight 0 290 15
alongside 0 290 15
Assad's 0 290 15
forces. 0 290 15

And 0 290 16
Iran 0 290 16
has 0 290 16
used 0 290 16
Syria 0 290 16
as 0 290 16
a 0 290 16
transit 0 290 16
point 0 290 16
for 0 290 16
shipment 0 290 16
of 0 290 16

Despite 0 290 17
the 0 290 17
fact 0 290 17
that 0 290 17
Hezbollah 0 290 17
has 0 290 17
American 1 290 17
blood 1 290 17
on 0 290 17
its 0 290 17
hands, 0 290 17
the 0 290 17
U.S.-led 0 290 17
coalition 0 290 17
has 0 290 17
chosen 0 290 17
not 0 290 17
to 0 290 17
do 0 290 17
anything 0 290 17
about 0 290 17
Hezbollah’s 0 290 17
presence 0 290 17
in 0 290 17
Syria, 0 290 17
bought 0 290 17
and 0 290 17
paid 0 290 17
for 0 290 17
by 0 290 17
Iran. 0 290 17

While 0 290 18
Israel 0 290 18
chose 0 290 18
not 0 290 18
to 0 290 18
take 0 290 18
sides 0 290 18
in 0 290 18
Syria's 0 290 18
civil 0 290 18
war 0 290 18
with 0 290 18
military 0 290 18
intervention 0 290 18
of 0 290 18
its 0 290 18
own, 0 290 18
it 0 290 18
has 0 290 18
bombed 0 290 18
weapons 0 290 18

facilities 0 290 18
and 0 290 18
convoys 0 290 18

Syria 0 290 18
for 0 290 18
its 0 290 18
own 0 290 18
protection. 0 290 18

Just 0 290 19
recently, 0 290 19
on 0 290 19
September 0 290 19
7th, 0 290 19
Israeli 0 290 19
jets 0 290 19
struck 0 290 19
a 0 290 19
Syrian 0 290 19
weapons 0 290 19
facility 0 290 19
near 0 290 19
Masyaf, 0 290 19
which 0 290 19
was 0 290 19
reported 0 290 19
to 0 290 19

been 0 290 19

for 0 290 19
the 0 290 19
production 0 290 19
of 0 290 19
chemical 0 290 19
weapons 0 290 19
and 0 290 19
the 0 290 19
storage 0 290 19
of 0 290 19
missiles. 0 290 19

Israel 0 290 20
will 0 290 20
also 0 290 20
do 0 290 20
what 0 290 20
is 0 290 20
necessary 0 290 20
to 0 290 20
repel 0 290 20
Iranian-backed 0 290 20
forces 0 290 20
if 0 290 20
they 0 290 20
edge 0 290 20
too 0 290 20
close 0 290 20
to 0 290 20
areas 0 290 20
near 0 290 20
the 0 290 20
Golan 0 290 20
Heights, 0 290 20
shrinking 0 290 20
the 0 290 20
buffer 0 290 20
between 0 290 20
Israel 0 290 20
and 0 290 20
Iranian 0 290 20
controlled 0 290 20
territories. 0 290 20

However, 0 290 21
such 0 290 21
tactical 0 290 21
measures 0 290 21
may 0 290 21
not 0 290 21
be 0 290 21
enough 0 290 21
to 0 290 21
thwart 0 290 21
Iran’s 0 290 21
larger 0 290 21
ambitions. 0 290 21

In 0 290 22
light 0 290 22
of 0 290 22
intelligence 0 290 22
reports 0 290 22
that 0 290 22
Assad 0 290 22
may 0 290 22
be 0 290 22
ready 0 290 22
to 0 290 22

in 0 290 22
Syria, 0 290 22
Israeli 0 290 22
leaders 0 290 22
have 0 290 22
concluded 0 290 22
that 0 290 22
they 0 290 22
cannot 0 290 22
wait 0 290 22
until 0 290 22
the 0 290 22
Trump 0 290 22

decides 0 290 22
to 0 290 22
deal 0 290 22
more 0 290 22
forcefully 0 290 22
with 0 290 22
Iran's 0 290 22
growing 0 290 22
use 0 290 22
of 0 290 22
Syria 0 290 22
as 0 290 22

“Their 0 290 23

As 0 290 24
long 0 290 24
as 0 290 24
nobody 0 290 24

Iran’s 0 290 24

raises 0 290 24

At 0 290 25

Israel 0 290 25
has 0 290 25
a 0 290 25

of 0 290 26

As 0 290 27
the 0 290 27

get 1 290 29
us 1 290 29
to 1 290 29
a 1 290 29
sustainable 1 290 29

the 0 290 29
Trump 0 290 29

In 0 290 31
the 0 290 31

Obama 0 294 4
and 0 294 4

Now 0 294 6
that 0 294 6

trying 1 294 6
to 1 294 6

to 0 294 6
label 0 294 6
President 0 294 6
Trump’s 0 294 6
decision 0 294 6
a 0 294 6
"reckless 1 294 6

to 0 294 6
accuse 0 294 6
the 0 294 6
Trump 0 294 6
administration 0 294 6
of 0 294 6
“lying 1 294 6
to 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
American 1 294 6
people.” 1 294 6
It 1 294 6
was 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
Obama 1 294 6
administration 1 294 6
that 1 294 6
recklessly 1 294 6
abandoned 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
facts 1 294 6
in 1 294 6
pressing 1 294 6
ahead 1 294 6
with 1 294 6
the 1 294 6
deal. 1 294 6

The 1 294 7
Obama 1 294 7
administration 1 294 7
lied 1 294 7
to 1 294 7
the 1 294 7
American 1 294 7
people, 1 294 7
abandoning 0 294 7
its 0 294 7
own 0 294 7
promises 0 294 7
to 0 294 7
ensure 0 294 7
that 0 294 7
the 0 294 7
deal 0 294 7
contained 0 294 7
ironclad 0 294 7
protections. 0 294 7

Moreover, 0 294 8
all 0 294 8
that 0 294 8
President 0 294 8
Trump 0 294 8
has 0 294 8
done 0 294 8
so 0 294 8
far 0 294 8
is 0 294 8
to 0 294 8
return 0 294 8
the 0 294 8
JCPOA 0 294 8
to 0 294 8
Congress 0 294 8
for 0 294 8
review. 0 294 8

Had 0 294 9
Obama 0 294 9
followed 0 294 9
the 0 294 9
Constitution 0 294 9
and 0 294 9
submitted 0 294 9

first 0 294 9

the 0 294 9
JCPOA 0 294 9
in 0 294 9
its 0 294 9
present 0 294 9
form 0 294 9
almost 0 294 9
certainly 0 294 9
would 0 294 9
not 0 294 9
have 0 294 9
been 0 294 9
approved. 0 294 9

Congress 0 294 10
should 0 294 10
now 0 294 10
have 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
opportunity 0 294 10
to 0 294 10
revisit 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
JCPOA 0 294 10
to 0 294 10
determine 0 294 10
whether 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
protections 0 294 10
that 0 294 10
the 0 294 10
Obama 0 294 10
administration 0 294 10
promised 0 294 10
are 0 294 10
working 0 294 10
as 0 294 10
advertised. 0 294 10

Congress 0 294 11
should 0 294 11
also 0 294 11
consider 0 294 11
whether 0 294 11
time 0 294 11
limits 0 294 11
on 0 294 11
Iran’s 0 294 11
commitments 0 294 11
continue 0 294 11
to 0 294 11
make 0 294 11
sense 0 294 11
in 0 294 11
light 0 294 11
of 0 294 11
what 0 294 11
we 0 294 11
are 0 294 11
now 0 294 11
experiencing 0 294 11
with 0 294 11
Iran’s 0 294 11
nuclear 0 294 11
technology 0 294 11
collaborator, 0 294 11
North 0 294 11
Korea. 0 294 11

It 0 294 12
bought 0 294 12
time 0 294 12
to 0 294 12
turn 0 294 12
into 0 294 12
a 0 294 12
full-fledged 0 294 12
nuclear 0 294 12
power 0 294 12
under 0 294 12
our 0 294 12
noses. 0 294 12

Kerry 0 294 13
had 0 294 13
promised 0 294 13
that 0 294 13
the 0 294 13
Iranian 0 294 13
regime 0 294 13
would 0 294 13
be 0 294 13
prohibited 0 294 13
from 0 294 13
testing 0 294 13
ballistic 0 294 13
missiles. 0 294 13

This 0 294 14
turned 0 294 14
out 0 294 14
to 0 294 14
be 0 294 14
a 0 294 14
lie. 0 294 14

After 0 294 15
the 0 294 15
JCPOA 0 294 15
was 0 294 15
finalized, 0 294 15
with 0 294 15
no 0 294 15
such 0 294 15
prohibition 0 294 15
included, 0 294 15
Iran 0 294 15
continued 0 294 15
to 0 294 15
test 0 294 15
such 0 294 15
missiles. 0 294 15

The 0 294 16
Obama 0 294 16
administration’s 0 294 16
response 0 294 16
was 0 294 16
that 0 294 16
the 0 294 16
missiles 0 294 16
had 0 294 16
become 0 294 16
a 0 294 16
separate 0 294 16
issue, 0 294 16
to 0 294 16
be 0 294 16
dealt 0 294 16

under 0 294 16

on 0 294 17
Iran’s 0 294 17

short, 0 294 23
the 0 294 23

during 0 294 24
an 0 294 24
interview 0 294 24
aired 0 294 24
on 0 294 24
April 0 294 24

2015, 0 294 24
that 0 294 24
under 0 294 24
the 0 294 24
deal’s 0 294 24
terms 0 294 24
then 0 294 24
still 0 294 24
being 0 294 24
negotiated, 0 294 24
“you 0 294 24

Rhodes 0 294 25
claimed 0 294 25
that 0 294 25
“if 0 294 25
we 0 294 25
see 0 294 25
a 0 294 25

we 0 294 25

it. 0 294 25

So 0 294 26
if 0 294 26
it's 0 294 26
a 0 294 26
suspicious 0 294 26
site 0 294 26
that 0 294 26

This 1 294 26
was 1 294 26
another 1 294 26
lie. 1 294 26

After 0 294 27
the 0 294 27

that 0 294 27

the 0 294 28

on 0 294 28

2015. 0 294 28

The 0 294 29
JCPOA’s 0 294 29
supporters, 0 294 29
including 0 294 29
Kerry, 0 294 29
have 0 294 29
made 0 294 29
much 0 294 29
of 0 294 29
the 0 294 29
fact 0 294 29
that 0 294 29

International 0 294 29
Atomic 0 294 29
Energy 0 294 29
Agency 0 294 29

on 0 294 29
several 0 294 29

verified 0 294 29
Iran’s 0 294 29
compliance 0 294 29
with 0 294 29
its 0 294 29
commitments 0 294 29

keeping 0 294 29
its 0 294 29
stock 0 294 29
of 0 294 29
low-enriched 0 294 29

forth 0 294 29

further 0 294 29
construction 0 294 29
of 0 294 29
the 0 294 29

Iran 0 294 30
was 0 294 30
found 0 294 30
to 0 294 30
have 0 294 30
slightly 0 294 30
exceeded 0 294 30
the 0 294 30

its 0 294 30
stock 0 294 30
of 0 294 30
heavy 0 294 30
water, 0 294 30
but 0 294 30
has 0 294 30
remedied 0 294 30
the 0 294 30
problem 0 294 30
to 0 294 30
the 0 294 30
IAEA’s 0 294 30
satisfaction. 0 294 30

IAEA 0 294 31
chief 0 294 31
Yukiya 0 294 31
Amano 0 294 31
reiterated 0 294 31
in 0 294 31
a 0 294 31
statement 0 294 31
he 0 294 31
issued 0 294 31
on 0 294 31
October 0 294 31
9th 0 294 31
that 0 294 31
Iran 0 294 31
has 0 294 31
remained 0 294 31
in 0 294 31
compliance 0 294 31
with 0 294 31
its 0 294 31
JCPOA 0 294 31
commitments. 0 294 31

The 0 294 32
problem, 0 294 32
as 0 294 32
any 0 294 32
clear-eyed 0 294 32
observer 0 294 32
of 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
process 0 294 32
recognizes, 0 294 32
is 0 294 32
that 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
IAEA 0 294 32
relies 0 294 32
on 0 294 32
Iran 0 294 32
for 0 294 32
self-inspection 0 294 32
of 0 294 32
certain 0 294 32
sites 0 294 32
that 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
regime 0 294 32
does 0 294 32
not 0 294 32
want 0 294 32
the 0 294 32
IAEA 0 294 32
to 0 294 32
inspect 0 294 32
freely 0 294 32
on 0 294 32
its 0 294 32
own. 0 294 32

IAEA 0 294 33
inspectors 0 294 33
have 0 294 33
avoided 0 294 33
examining 0 294 33
military 0 294 33
sites 0 294 33
it 0 294 33
knows 0 294 33
exists 0 294 33
and 0 294 33
has 0 294 33
no 0 294 33
reliable 0 294 33
way 0 294 33
of 0 294 33
tracking 0 294 33
undeclared 0 294 33
sites. 0 294 33

The 0 294 34
IAEA’s 0 294 34
explanation 0 294 34
for 0 294 34
not 0 294 34
visiting 0 294 34
any 0 294 34
of 0 294 34
Iran’s 0 294 34
known 0 294 34
military 0 294 34
sites 0 294 34
is 0 294 34
that 0 294 34
it 0 294 34
had 0 294 34
“no 0 294 34
reason 0 294 34
to 0 294 34
ask” 0 294 34
for 0 294 34
access. 0 294 34

Evidently, 0 294 35
the 0 294 35
IAEA 0 294 35
is 0 294 35
supposed 0 294 35
to 0 294 35
block 0 294 35
out 0 294 35
the 0 294 35
fact 0 294 35
that 0 294 35
Iran 0 294 35
had 0 294 35
conducted 0 294 35
tests 0 294 35
relevant 0 294 35
to 0 294 35
nuclear 0 294 35
bomb 0 294 35
detonations 0 294 35
at 0 294 35
a 0 294 35
military 0 294 35
site 0 294 35
before 0 294 35
the 0 294 35
JCPOA’s 0 294 35
finalization 0 294 35
in 0 294 35
2015. 0 294 35

The 0 294 36
IAEA 0 294 36
should 0 294 36
just 0 294 36
pretend 0 294 36
that 0 294 36
such 0 294 36
tests 0 294 36
could 0 294 36
not 0 294 36
possibly 0 294 36
happen 0 294 36
again. 0 294 36

“Nobody 0 294 37
is 0 294 37
allowed 0 294 37
to 0 294 37
visit 0 294 37
Iran's 0 294 37
military 0 294 37
sites,” 0 294 37
said 0 294 37
Iran’s 0 294 37
Head 0 294 37
of 0 294 37

Intimidation 0 294 38
works. 0 294 38

The 0 294 39
IAEA 0 294 39
knows 0 294 39
not 0 294 39
to 0 294 39
ask. 0 294 39

As 0 294 40
to 0 294 40
the 0 294 40
JCPOA’s 0 294 40
sunset 0 294 40
provisions, 0 294 40
the 0 294 40
Obama 1 294 40
administration 1 294 40
lied 1 294 40
about 1 294 40
that 1 294 40
too. 1 294 40

Kerry 0 294 41
claimed 0 294 41
on 0 294 41
September 0 294 41
2, 0 294 41
2015 0 294 41
that 0 294 41
the 0 294 41
JCPOA 0 294 41
“never 0 294 41
sunsets. 0 294 41

There’s 0 294 42
no 0 294 42
sunset 0 294 42
in 0 294 42
this 0 294 42
agreement.” 0 294 42

This 0 294 43
month 0 294 43
Kerry 0 294 43
has 0 294 43
resorted 0 294 43
to 0 294 43
parsing 0 294 43
words. 0 294 43

He 0 294 44
claims 0 294 44
the 0 294 44
phrase 0 294 44
'sunset 0 294 44
provisions' 0 294 44
is 0 294 44
a 0 294 44
“misnomer,” 0 294 44
before 0 294 44
then 0 294 44
defending 0 294 44
the 0 294 44
JCPOA’s 0 294 44
time 0 294 44
limits. 0 294 44

"We 0 294 45
were 0 294 45
comfortable 0 294 45
because 0 294 45
the 0 294 45

on 0 294 45
Iran’s 0 294 45
low-enriched 0 294 45

remains 0 294 45
in 0 294 45
place 0 294 45
until 0 294 45
2030,” 0 294 45
Kerry 0 294 45
wrote 0 294 45
in 0 294 45
an 0 294 45
article 0 294 45
published 0 294 45
in 0 294 45
the 0 294 45
Washington 0 294 45

last 0 294 45

In 0 294 46
other 0 294 46
words, 0 294 46
let’s 1 294 46
just 1 294 46
kick 1 294 46
the 1 294 46
can 1 294 46
down 1 294 46
the 1 294 46
road 1 294 46

hope 0 294 46
for 0 294 46
a 0 294 46
more 0 294 46
reasonable 0 294 46
Iranian 0 294 46
regime 0 294 46
in 0 294 46
13 0 294 46
years 0 294 46
that 0 294 46
would 0 294 46
agree 0 294 46
to 0 294 46
extend 0 294 46
the 0 294 46
time 0 294 46
limits. 0 294 46

In 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
meantime, 0 294 47
Kerry 0 294 47
advises 0 294 47
us 0 294 47
not 0 294 47

“15 0 294 48
or 0 294 48
25 0 294 48
years 0 294 48
from 0 294 48
now, 0 294 48
we 0 294 48

we 0 294 48
have 0 294 48
today.” 0 294 48

John 0 294 49
Kerry 0 294 49
has 0 294 49
obviously 0 294 49
learned 0 294 49
nothing 0 294 49
from 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
North 0 294 49
Korean 0 294 49
fiasco, 1 294 49
which 0 294 49
resulted 0 294 49
from 0 294 49
years 0 294 49
of 0 294 49
phony 1 294 49
agreements 1 294 49
with 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
rogue 0 294 49
regime 0 294 49
and 0 294 49
so-called 0 294 49
“strategic 0 294 49
patience.” 0 294 49
The 0 294 49
United 0 294 49
States 0 294 49
clearly 0 294 49
does 0 294 49
not 0 294 49
have 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
same 0 294 49
military 0 294 49
options 0 294 49
today 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
deal 0 294 49
with 0 294 49
a 0 294 49
nuclear 0 294 49
armed 0 294 49
North 0 294 49
Korea 0 294 49
as 0 294 49
it 0 294 49
did 0 294 49
23 0 294 49
years 0 294 49
ago 0 294 49
when 0 294 49
former 0 294 49
President 0 294 49
Bill 0 294 49
Clinton 0 294 49
decided 0 294 49
not 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
use 0 294 49
military 0 294 49
force 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
stamp 0 294 49
out 0 294 49
North 0 294 49
Korea’s 0 294 49
nuclear 0 294 49
program 0 294 49
at 0 294 49
its 0 294 49
inception. 0 294 49

Instead, 0 294 50
Clinton 0 294 50
started 0 294 50
us 0 294 50
down 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
primrose 0 294 50
path 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
naïve 0 294 50
diplomacy 0 294 50
with 0 294 50
a 0 294 50
duplicitous 0 294 50
regime 0 294 50
that 0 294 50
now 0 294 50
is 0 294 50
on 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
verge 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
being 0 294 50
able 0 294 50
to 0 294 50
strike 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
U.S. 0 294 50
mainland 0 294 50
with 0 294 50

delivered 0 294 50
by 0 294 50
intercontinental 0 294 50

missiles. 0 294 50

It 0 294 51
is 0 294 51
precisely 0 294 51
because 0 294 51
North 1 294 51
Korea’s 1 294 51
actions 1 294 51
over 1 294 51
the 1 294 51
last 1 294 51
23 1 294 51
years 1 294 51
have 1 294 51
proven 1 294 51
that 1 294 51
making 1 294 51
concessions 1 294 51
to 1 294 51
a 1 294 51
rogue 1 294 51
regime 1 294 51
in 1 294 51
order 1 294 51
to 1 294 51
obtain 1 294 51
denuclearization 1 294 51
commitments 1 294 51
is 1 294 51
so 1 294 51
dangerous 1 294 51
that 1 294 51
President 1 294 51
Trump 1 294 51
does 1 294 51
not 1 294 51
want 1 294 51

praising 0 294 53
the 0 294 53

and 0 294 53
its 0 294 53
implementation. 0 294 53

They 0 294 54
said 0 294 54
that 0 294 54
the 0 294 54
nuclear 0 294 54
deal 0 294 54
with 0 294 54
Iran 0 294 54
was 0 294 54
“the 0 294 54
culmination 0 294 54
of 0 294 54
13 0 294 54
years 0 294 54
of 0 294 54
diplomacy 0 294 54
and 0 294 54
was 0 294 54
a 0 294 54
major 0 294 54
step 0 294 54
towards 0 294 54
ensuring 0 294 54
that 0 294 54
Iran’s 0 294 54
nuclear 0 294 54
programme 0 294 54
is 0 294 54
not 0 294 54
diverted 0 294 54
for 0 294 54
military 0 294 54
purposes. 0 294 54

Therefore, 0 294 55
we 0 294 55
encourage 0 294 55
the 1 294 55
US 1 294 55
Administration 1 294 55
and 1 294 55
Congress 1 294 55
to 1 294 55
consider 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
implications 1 294 55
to 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
security 1 294 55
of 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
US 1 294 55
and 1 294 55
its 1 294 55
allies 1 294 55
before 1 294 55
taking 1 294 55
any 1 294 55
steps 1 294 55
that 1 294 55
might 1 294 55
undermine 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
JCPOA, 1 294 55
such 1 294 55
as 1 294 55
re-imposing 1 294 55
sanctions 1 294 55
on 1 294 55
Iran 1 294 55
lifted 1 294 55
under 1 294 55
the 1 294 55
agreement.” 1 294 55

Perhaps 0 294 56
these 0 294 56
European 0 294 56
leaders 0 294 56
should 0 294 56
remember 0 294 56

has 0 297 20
been 0 297 20
calling 0 297 20
for 0 297 20
regime 0 297 20
change 0 297 20
in 0 297 20
Iran. 0 297 20

Now, 0 297 21
he’s 0 297 21
the 0 297 21
National 0 297 21

Advisor. 0 297 21

It 0 297 22
just 0 297 22
so 0 297 22
happens 0 297 22
that 0 297 22
at 0 297 22
least 0 297 22
one 0 297 22
of 0 297 22
these 0 297 22
calls 0 297 22
for 0 297 22
regime 0 297 22
change 0 297 22
in 0 297 22
Iran 0 297 22
was 0 297 22
caught 0 297 22
on 0 297 22
video 0 297 22
last 0 297 22
year 0 297 22
as 0 297 22
Bolton 0 297 22
gave 0 297 22
a 0 297 22
speech 0 297 22
at 0 297 22
the 0 297 22
Grand 0 297 22
Gathering 0 297 22
of 0 297 22
Iranians 0 297 22

“There 0 297 23
is 0 297 23
a 0 297 23
viable 0 297 23
opposition 0 297 23
to 0 297 23
the 0 297 23
rule 0 297 23
of 0 297 23
the 0 297 23
ayatollahs, 0 297 23
and 0 297 23
that 0 297 23
opposition 0 297 23
is 0 297 23
centered 0 297 23
in 0 297 23
this 0 297 23
room 0 297 23
today. 0 297 23

I 0 297 24
had 0 297 24
said 0 297 24
for 0 297 24
over 0 297 24
10 0 297 24
years 0 297 24
since 0 297 24
coming 0 297 24
to 0 297 24
these 0 297 24
events, 0 297 24
that 0 297 24
the 0 297 24
declared 0 297 24
policy 0 297 24
of 0 297 24
the 0 297 24
United 0 297 24
States 0 297 24
of 0 297 24
America 0 297 24
should 0 297 24
be 0 297 24
the 0 297 24
overthrow 0 297 24
of 0 297 24
the 0 297 24
mullahs’ 0 297 24
regime 0 297 24
in 0 297 24
Tehran. 0 297 24

The 0 297 25
behavior 0 297 25
and 0 297 25
the 0 297 25
objectives 0 297 25
of 0 297 25
the 0 297 25
regime 0 297 25
are 0 297 25
not 0 297 25
going 0 297 25
to 0 297 25
change, 0 297 25
and 0 297 25
therefore 0 297 25
the 0 297 25
only 0 297 25
solution 0 297 25
is 0 297 25
to 0 297 25
change 0 297 25
the 0 297 25
regime 0 297 25
itself. 0 297 25

And 0 297 26
that’s 0 297 26
why, 0 297 26
before 0 297 26
2019, 0 297 26
we 0 297 26
here 0 297 26
will 0 297 26
celebrate 0 297 26
in 0 297 26
Tehran!” 0 297 26

Pay 0 297 27
attention 0 297 27
to 0 297 27
the 0 297 27
first 0 297 27
line 0 297 27
in 0 297 27
that 0 297 27
quote 0 297 27
above 0 297 27
in 0 297 27
which 0 297 27
Bolton 0 297 27
notes 0 297 27
that 0 297 27
the 0 297 27
opposition 0 297 27
needed 0 297 27
to 0 297 27
overthrow 0 297 27
Iran’s 0 297 27

Who 1 297 27
was 1 297 27
in 1 297 27
that 1 297 27
room? 1 297 27

Well, 0 297 28
the 0 297 28
entire 0 297 28
event 0 297 28
was 0 297 28
actually 0 297 28
put 0 297 28
on 0 297 28
by 0 297 28
the 0 297 28
People’s 0 297 28
Mojahedin 0 297 28
Organization 0 297 28
of 0 297 28
Iran, 0 297 28
also 0 297 28
known 0 297 28
as 0 297 28
the 0 297 28
Mojahedin-e 0 297 28
Khalq 0 297 28
or 0 297 28
MEK. 0 297 28

As 0 297 29
Politico 0 297 29
pointed 0 297 29
out 0 297 29
in 0 297 29
a 0 297 29
2016 0 297 29
article, 0 297 29
despite 0 297 29
the 0 297 29
neocon 0 297 29
attempts 0 297 29
to 0 297 29
rewrite 0 297 29
history, 0 297 29
MEK 0 297 29
have 0 297 29
killed 0 297 29
Americans 0 297 29
and 0 297 29
committed 0 297 29
multiple 0 297 29
acts 0 297 29
of 0 297 29
terrorism. 0 297 29

For 0 297 30
decades, 0 297 30
and 0 297 30
based 0 297 30
on 0 297 30
U.S. 0 297 30
intelligence, 0 297 30
the 0 297 30
United 0 297 30
States 0 297 30
government 0 297 30
has 0 297 30
blamed 0 297 30
the 0 297 30
MEK 0 297 30
for 0 297 30
killing 0 297 30
three 0 297 30

colonels 0 297 30
and 0 297 30
three 0 297 30

bombing 0 297 30
the 0 297 30

of 0 297 30
numerous 0 297 30

and 0 297 30
killing 0 297 30
innocent 0 297 30
Iranians. 0 297 30

To 0 297 31
recap, 0 297 31
the 0 297 31
formerly 0 297 31
terrorist-classified 0 297 31
organization 0 297 31
MEK, 0 297 31
trained 0 297 31
in 0 297 31
the 0 297 31

2012—which 0 297 31
has 0 297 31
since 0 297 31
been 0 297 31
heavily 0 297 31
funded 0 297 31
to 0 297 31
refine 0 297 31
their 0 297 31

for 0 297 31
“regime 0 297 31
change” 0 297 31
on 0 297 31
their 0 297 31
behalf—is 0 297 31
now 0 297 31
the 0 297 31
darling 1 297 31
child 1 297 31
of 0 297 31
the 0 297 31
neocon 0 297 31
agenda 0 297 31
and 0 297 31
the 0 297 31

While 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
current 0 297 32
Iranian 0 297 32
regime 0 297 32
is 0 297 32
certainly 0 297 32
no 0 297 32
bastion 0 297 32
of 0 297 32
freedom, 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
idea 0 297 32
that 0 297 32
US 0 297 32
intervention 0 297 32
or 0 297 32
a 0 297 32
violent 0 297 32
revolution 0 297 32
would 0 297 32
be 0 297 32
beneficial 0 297 32
for 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
people 0 297 32
of 0 297 32
Iran 0 297 32
or 0 297 32
American 0 297 32
citizens 0 297 32
is 0 297 32
outright 1 297 32
insane. 1 297 32

To 0 297 33
see 0 297 33
what 0 297 33
US 0 297 33
intervention—through 0 297 33
military 0 297 33
support 0 297 33
and 0 297 33
the 0 297 33
support 0 297 33
of 0 297 33
opposition 0 297 33
groups—does 0 297 33
to 0 297 33
countries, 0 297 33
one 0 297 33
need 0 297 33
only 0 297 33
look 0 297 33
at 0 297 33
Syria, 0 297 33
Iraq, 0 297 33
Afghanistan, 0 297 33
and 0 297 33
Libya 0 297 33
to 0 297 33
see 0 297 33
the 0 297 33
horrific 1 297 33
death 0 297 33
tolls 0 297 33
and 0 297 33
war-ravaged 1 297 33
dystopias 1 297 33
left 0 297 33
in 0 297 33
America’s 0 297 33
wake. 0 297 33

To 0 297 34
those 0 297 34
paying 0 297 34
attention 0 297 34
over 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
years, 0 297 34
Trump’s 0 297 34
desire 0 297 34
to 0 297 34
intervene 0 297 34
in 0 297 34
Iran, 0 297 34
and 0 297 34
his 0 297 34
subsequent 0 297 34
support 0 297 34
in 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
media 0 297 34
and 0 297 34
from 0 297 34
all 0 297 34
sides 0 297 34
of 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
political 0 297 34
spectrum 0 297 34
should 0 297 34
come 0 297 34
as 0 297 34
no 0 297 34
surprise 0 297 34
as 0 297 34
it 0 297 34
has 0 297 34
been 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
plan 0 297 34
since 0 297 34
Bill 0 297 34
Clinton 0 297 34
was 0 297 34
in 0 297 34
office 0 297 34
and 0 297 34
was 0 297 34
documented 0 297 34
in 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
neoconservative 0 297 34
PNAC 0 297 34
report. 0 297 34

This 0 297 35
was 0 297 35
even 0 297 35
admitted 0 297 35
by 0 297 35
General 0 297 35

Clark, 0 297 35
former 0 297 35
Supreme 0 297 35

Commander 0 297 35
of 0 297 35
NATO, 0 297 35
that 0 297 35
the 0 297 35
U.S. 0 297 35
planned 0 297 35
on 0 297 35
going 0 297 35
to 0 297 35
war 0 297 35
with 0 297 35
Iran, 0 297 35
according 0 297 35
to 0 297 35
a 0 297 35
2001 0 297 35
memo 0 297 35
from 0 297 35

U.S. 0 297 35

of 0 297 35

“This 0 297 36

out 0 297 36
seven 0 297 36
countries 0 297 36
in 0 297 36
five 0 297 36

Clark 0 297 36
said. 0 297 36

“Starting 0 297 37
with 0 297 37

All 0 297 38

let's 0 301 15
deal 0 301 15
with 0 301 15
the 0 301 15
misleading 0 301 15
reporting. 0 301 15

Rombot 0 301 16
was 0 301 16
not 0 301 16
taken 0 301 16
into 0 301 16

Rombot 0 301 17
was 0 301 17
taken 0 301 17
into 0 301 17
custody 0 301 17
because 0 301 17
he 0 301 17

an 0 301 17
outstanding 0 301 17
Final 0 301 17

a 1 301 17

symptomatic 1 301 17
of 1 301 17

lies 1 301 17
from 1 301 17

previously 0 301 18
ordered 0 301 18
a 0 301 18
stay 0 301 18
to 0 301 18
the 0 301 18
deportations. 0 301 18

She 0 301 19
is 0 301 19
currently 0 301 19
weighing 0 301 19
whether 0 301 19
she 0 301 19
can 0 301 19
order 0 301 19
a 0 301 19
longer 0 301 19

to 0 301 19
give 0 301 19
the 0 301 19
affected 0 301 19

time 0 301 19
to 0 301 19

to 0 301 19
gain 0 301 19

status. 0 301 19

with 0 301 20
regard 0 301 20
to 0 301 20
Saris, 0 301 20
she 0 301 20
has 0 301 20
no 0 301 20
authority 0 301 20
to 0 301 20
interfere 0 301 20
with 0 301 20
the 0 301 20
pre-deportation 0 301 20
custody 0 301 20
of 0 301 20
an 0 301 20

Order 0 301 20

Rombot 0 301 21
was 0 301 21
taken 0 301 21
into 0 301 21
custody 0 301 21
because 0 301 21
he 0 301 21
was 0 301 21
soon 0 301 21
to 0 301 21
be 0 301 21
deported. 0 301 21

There 0 301 22
was 0 301 22
no 0 301 22
issue 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
Indonesia 0 301 22
not 0 301 22
accepting 0 301 22

not 0 301 22
providing 0 301 22
a 0 301 22

document, 0 301 22
so 0 301 22
there 0 301 22
was 0 301 22
no 0 301 22
question 0 301 22
of 0 301 22
him 0 301 22
being 0 301 22
held 0 301 22
in 0 301 22
custody 0 301 22
longer 0 301 22
than 0 301 22

in 0 301 22
the 0 301 22

Cyr 0 301 22

that 0 301 22
restricted 0 301 22

She 0 301 23
still 0 301 23
thinks 0 301 23
that 0 301 23

can 0 301 23

all 0 303 1

of 0 303 1
Jesus 0 303 1

But 0 303 3
the 0 303 3
narrative 0 303 3
surrounding 0 303 3
him 0 303 3
has 0 303 3
changed 0 303 3
wildly 0 303 3
since 0 303 3
the 0 303 3
authorities 0 303 3
mentioned 0 303 3
him, 0 303 3
and 0 303 3
now, 0 303 3
he’s 0 303 3
mysteriously 1 303 3
vanished 1 303 3
into 1 303 3
thin 1 303 3

Of 0 303 4
course, 0 303 4
this 0 303 4
leads 0 303 4
many 0 303 4
to 0 303 4
believe 0 303 4
that 0 303 4

even 0 303 4
exist, 0 303 4
to 0 303 4
begin 0 303 4
with. 0 303 4

His 1 303 5
mere 1 303 5
existence 1 303 5
appears 1 303 5
to 1 303 5
have 1 303 5
been 1 303 5
fabricated 1 303 5
by 1 303 5
the 1 303 5
very 1 303 5
authorities 1 303 5
who 1 303 5
are 1 303 5
cramming 1 303 5

the 1 303 5
sake 1 303 5
of 1 303 5

There 0 303 6
are 0 303 6
two 0 303 6
conflicting 0 303 6

what 0 303 6

so 0 303 6
far 0 303 6
made 0 303 6

is 0 303 6
that 0 303 6

the 1 303 6

just 0 303 6
outside 0 303 6
his 0 303 6

Once 0 303 7
he 0 303 7
saw 0 303 7
Campos, 0 303 7
Paddock 0 303 7
reportedly 0 303 7
fired 0 303 7
nearly 0 303 7
200 0 303 7
rounds 0 303 7
through 0 303 7
his 0 303 7

in 0 303 7

Paddock 0 303 8
allegedly 0 303 8
opened 0 303 8
fire 0 303 8
on 0 303 8

injuring 0 303 8

But 0 303 9
Campos 0 303 9
has 0 303 9
been 0 303 9
a 0 303 9
mysterious 0 303 9
subject 0 303 9
since 0 303 9
being 0 303 9
wounded 0 303 9
in 0 303 9
the 0 303 9

went 0 303 10

just 0 303 10
moments 0 303 10
before 0 303 10

Campos’s 0 303 11

said 0 303 11
he 0 303 11
got 0 303 11
a 0 303 11
text 0 303 11
that 0 303 11
Campos 0 303 11
had 0 303 11
been 0 303 11
taken 0 303 11

says 0 303 12
none 0 303 12

filled 0 303 12
out 0 303 12

for 0 303 12
a 0 303 12

by 0 303 12
that 0 303 12
name, 0 303 12
and 0 303 12
Campos 0 303 12
has 0 303 12
been 0 303 12
silent 0 303 12
since 0 303 12
the 0 303 12
text; 0 303 12
vanishing 1 303 12
into 1 303 12
thin 1 303 12
air. 1 303 12

He 0 303 13
also 0 303 13
isn’t 0 303 13
listed 0 303 13

“Right 0 303 14
now 0 303 14
I’m 0 303 14
just 0 303 14
concerned 0 303 14
where 0 303 14
my 0 303 14
member 0 303 14
is, 0 303 14
and 0 303 14
what 0 303 14
his 0 303 14
condition 0 303 14
is. 0 303 14

It’s 0 303 15
highly 0 303 15
unusual,” 0 303 15
Hickey 0 303 15
told 0 303 15
media. 0 303 15

“I’m 0 303 16
hoping 0 303 16
everything 0 303 16
is 0 303 16
OK 0 303 16
with 0 303 16
him 0 303 16
and 0 303 16
I’m 0 303 16
sure 0 303 16
MGM 0 303 16
or 0 303 16
the 0 303 16
union 0 303 16
will 0 303 16
let 0 303 16
(media) 0 303 16
know 0 303 16
when 0 303 16
we 0 303 16
hear 0 303 16
something,” 0 303 16
he 0 303 16
said. 0 303 16

In 0 303 17
the 0 303 17
meantime, 0 303 17
authorities 0 303 17
still 0 303 17
have 0 303 17
not 0 303 17
released 0 303 17
a 0 303 17
conclusive 0 303 17
timeline 0 303 17
for 0 303 17
the 0 303 17
shooting 0 303 17
they 1 303 17
desperately 1 303 17
want 1 303 17
us 1 303 17
to 1 303 17
believe 1 303 17
was 0 303 17
committed 0 303 17
by 0 303 17
Paddock. 0 303 17

And, 0 303 18
according 0 303 18
to 0 303 18
the 0 303 18

are 0 303 18

I’m 0 304 3
posting 0 304 3
the 0 304 3
address 0 304 3
here 0 304 3
because 0 304 3
I'm 0 304 3
convinced 0 304 3
the 0 304 3
Archbishop’s 0 304 3
words 0 304 3
provide 0 304 3
recent 0 304 3
recruits 0 304 3
to 0 304 3
Tradition 0 304 3
with 0 304 3
vital 0 304 3
historical 0 304 3
context 0 304 3
for 0 304 3
the 0 304 3
diabolical 1 304 3

that 0 304 3

the 0 304 3
pontificate 0 304 3
of 0 304 3

And 0 304 4
for 0 304 4
those 0 304 4
of 0 304 4
us 0 304 4
who’ve 0 304 4
been 0 304 4
in 0 304 4
the 0 304 4
trenches 0 304 4
for 0 304 4
a 0 304 4
long, 0 304 4
long 0 304 4
time 0 304 4
it 0 304 4
also 0 304 4
provides 0 304 4
welcome 0 304 4
reminder 0 304 4
of 0 304 4
why 0 304 4
we 0 304 4
must 0 304 4
continue 0 304 4
to 0 304 4
fight. 0 304 4

Even 0 304 5
though 0 304 5
I 0 304 5
personally 0 304 5
was 0 304 5
in 0 304 5
attendance 0 304 5
back 0 304 5
in 0 304 5
1976 0 304 5
when 0 304 5
Archbishop 0 304 5
Lefebvre 0 304 5
delivered 0 304 5
this 0 304 5
address 0 304 5
in 0 304 5
Minneapolis, 0 304 5
I 0 304 5
was 0 304 5
only 0 304 5
ten 0 304 5
years 0 304 5
old 0 304 5
and 0 304 5
of 0 304 5
course 0 304 5
didn't 0 304 5
realize 0 304 5
how 0 304 5
prophetic 0 304 5
he 0 304 5
was 0 304 5
on 0 304 5
that 0 304 5
occasion, 0 304 5
or 0 304 5
how 0 304 5
devastated 0 304 5
by 0 304 5
the 0 304 5

In 0 304 6
fact, 0 304 6
this 0 304 6
transcript 0 304 6
reads 0 304 6
like 0 304 6
a 0 304 6
message 0 304 6
of 0 304 6
encouragement 0 304 6
at 0 304 6
a 0 304 6
crucial 0 304 6
moment 0 304 6
in 0 304 6
the 0 304 6
history 0 304 6
of 0 304 6
this 0 304 6
movement—Stay 0 304 6

Keep 1 304 7
the 1 304 7
Faith. 1 304 7

Never 1 304 8
surrender! 1 304 8

This 0 304 9
address 0 304 9
also 0 304 9
makes 0 304 9
it 0 304 9
absolutely 0 304 9
clear 0 304 9
that 0 304 9
everything 0 304 9
Archbishop 0 304 9
Lefebvre 0 304 9
did 0 304 9
was 0 304 9
part 0 304 9
of 0 304 9
an 0 304 9
eleventh-hour 0 304 9
defence 0 304 9
of 0 304 9
the 0 304 9
Kingship 0 304 9
of 0 304 9
Christ 0 304 9
(ignored 0 304 9
completely 0 304 9
by 0 304 9
the 0 304 9
Second 0 304 9

for 0 304 9

the 1 304 9
infallible 1 304 9
teachings 1 304 9
of 1 304 9
Mother 1 304 9

of 0 304 9
course 0 304 9
her 0 304 9
ancient 0 304 9
liturgy. 0 304 9

And 0 304 10
now 0 304 10
that 0 304 10
Pope 0 304 10
Francis 0 304 10
has 0 304 10
inadvertently 0 304 10
unmasked 0 304 10
the 0 304 10
true 0 304 10
spirit 0 304 10
of 0 304 10
Vatican 0 304 10
II, 0 304 10
it 0 304 10
becomes 0 304 10
obvious 0 304 10
how 0 304 10
and 0 304 10
why 0 304 10
those 0 304 10
who 0 304 10
resisted 0 304 10
that 0 304 10
spirit 0 304 10
were 0 304 10
right 0 304 10
to 0 304 10
have 0 304 10
done 0 304 10
so 0 304 10
and 0 304 10
will 0 304 10
certainly 0 304 10
be 0 304 10
hailed 0 304 10
by 0 304 10
history 0 304 10
as 0 304 10
the 0 304 10
heroic 0 304 10
band 0 304 10
of 0 304 10
Catholic 0 304 10
brothers 0 304 10
that 0 304 10
mounted 0 304 10

for 0 304 10
Christ 0 304 10
the 0 304 10
King 0 304 10
and, 0 304 10
while 0 304 10
scorned 0 304 10
and 0 304 10
mocked 0 304 10
at 0 304 10
the 0 304 10
time, 0 304 10
were 0 304 10

the 0 304 11
right 0 304 11

what 0 304 15
he 0 304 15
says 0 304 15
in 0 304 15
good 0 304 15

because 0 304 15
he 0 304 15
said 0 304 15
all 0 304 15
of 0 304 15
the 0 304 15
things 0 304 15
I 0 304 15
want 0 304 15
to 0 304 15

thank 0 304 16
you, 0 304 16
Mr. 0 304 16
Matt, 0 304 16
very 0 304 16
much, 0 304 16
for 0 304 16
his 0 304 16
invitation, 0 304 16
and 0 304 16
I 0 304 16
thank 0 304 16
you 0 304 16
for 0 304 16
your 0 304 16
coming, 0 304 16
and 0 304 16
I 0 304 16
thank 0 304 16
Fr. 0 304 16

Ward 0 304 17
for 0 304 17
what 0 304 17
he 0 304 17
said 0 304 17
about 0 304 17
the 0 304 17
Society 0 304 17
of 0 304 17
St. 0 304 17
Pius 0 304 17
X. 0 304 17

And 0 304 18
I 0 304 18
hope 0 304 18
that 0 304 18
you 0 304 18
can 0 304 18
understand 0 304 18
my 0 304 18
poor 0 304 18
English, 0 304 18
but 0 304 18
I 0 304 18
think 0 304 18
it 0 304 18
is 0 304 18
better 0 304 18
to 0 304 18
speak 0 304 18
some 0 304 18
bad 0 304 18
English 0 304 18
because 0 304 18
to 0 304 18
translate 0 304 18
would 0 304 18
take 0 304 18
too 0 304 18
much 0 304 18
time. 0 304 18

As 0 304 19
Mr. 0 304 19
Matt 0 304 19
said, 0 304 19
the 0 304 19
crisis 0 304 19
in 0 304 19
the 0 304 19
Church 0 304 19
is 0 304 19
very 0 304 19
extraordinary. 0 304 19

It 0 304 20
is 0 304 20
very 0 304 20
difficult 0 304 20
to 0 304 20
understand 0 304 20
the 0 304 20
situation 0 304 20
today. 0 304 20

My 0 304 21
seminary 0 304 21
in 0 304 21
Econe 0 304 21
(in 0 304 21
Switzerland) 0 304 21
and 0 304 21
the 0 304 21
seminaries 0 304 21
in 0 304 21
Germany 0 304 21
and 0 304 21
here 0 304 21
in 0 304 21
America, 0 304 21
in 0 304 21
Armada, 0 304 21
are 0 304 21
in 0 304 21
very 0 304 21
difficult 0 304 21
situations 0 304 21
with 0 304 21
Rome. 0 304 21

Why? 0 304 22

These 0 304 23
seminaries 0 304 23
are 0 304 23
the 0 304 23
same 0 304 23
as 0 304 23
seminaries 0 304 23
were 0 304 23
before 0 304 23
the 0 304 23
Second 0 304 23
Vatican 0 304 23
Council. 0 304 23

They 0 304 24
have 0 304 24
the 0 304 24
same 0 304 24
discipline 0 304 24
and 0 304 24
the 0 304 24
same 0 304 24
studies, 0 304 24
they 0 304 24
make 0 304 24
good 0 304 24
priests; 0 304 24
I 0 304 24
think 0 304 24
they 0 304 24
are 0 304 24
good 0 304 24
seminarians. 0 304 24

All 0 304 25
is 0 304 25
done 0 304 25
as 0 304 25
all 0 304 25
the 0 304 25
seminaries 0 304 25
before 0 304 25
the 0 304 25
Second 0 304 25
Vatican 0 304 25
Council. 0 304 25

Why 0 304 26
are 0 304 26
we 0 304 26
now 0 304 26
in 0 304 26
this 0 304 26
very 0 304 26
sad 0 304 26
situation 0 304 26
with 0 304 26
Rome? 0 304 26

I 0 304 27
think 0 304 27
that 0 304 27
because 0 304 27
in 0 304 27
the 0 304 27
Second 0 304 27
Vatican 0 304 27
Council, 0 304 27
and 0 304 27
after 0 304 27
the 0 304 27
Council, 0 304 27
there 0 304 27
is 0 304 27
a 1 304 27
mutation, 1 304 27
a 1 304 27
change, 1 304 27
in 1 304 27
the 1 304 27
Church. 1 304 27

But 0 304 28
we 0 304 28
do 0 304 28
not 0 304 28
change. 0 304 28

We 0 304 29
continue 0 304 29
the 0 304 29
Tradition. 0 304 29

So 0 304 30
why 0 304 30
do 0 304 30
they 0 304 30
now 0 304 30
say, 0 304 30
as 0 304 30
Mgr. 0 304 30

(Archbishop) 0 304 31
Benelli[1] 0 304 31
said 0 304 31
to 0 304 31
me 0 304 31
months 0 304 31
ago 0 304 31
on 0 304 31
the 0 304 31
19th 0 304 31
of 0 304 31
March, 0 304 31
“you 0 304 31
are 0 304 31
out 0 304 31
of 0 304 31
communion 0 304 31
with 0 304 31
the 0 304 31
Church.” 0 304 31
I 0 304 31
am 0 304 31
out 0 304 31
of 0 304 31
communion 0 304 31
with 0 304 31
the 0 304 31
Church 0 304 31
because 0 304 31
I 0 304 31
continue 0 304 31
the 0 304 31
Tradition 0 304 31
of 0 304 31
the 0 304 31
Church? 0 304 31

This 0 304 32
is 0 304 32
possible? 0 304 32

I 0 304 33
do 0 304 33
not 0 304 33
understand. 0 304 33

Why? 0 304 34

I 0 304 35
have 0 304 35
done 0 304 35
nothing. 0 304 35

I 0 304 36
believe 0 304 36
nothing 0 304 36
other 0 304 36
than 0 304 36
what 0 304 36
the 0 304 36
Church 0 304 36
has 0 304 36
believed 0 304 36
for 0 304 36
twenty 0 304 36
centuries. 0 304 36

Mgr. 0 304 37

Benelli 0 304 38
then 0 304 38
said 0 304 38
to 0 304 38
me, 0 304 38
you 0 304 38
must 0 304 38
put 0 304 38
down 0 304 38
in 0 304 38
a 0 304 38
writing 0 304 38
to 0 304 38
the 0 304 38
Holy 0 304 38
Father 0 304 38
that 0 304 38
you 0 304 38
accept 0 304 38
the 0 304 38
Second 0 304 38
Vatican 0 304 38
Council, 0 304 38
you 0 304 38
accept 0 304 38
the 0 304 38
reform 0 304 38
that 0 304 38
followed 0 304 38
the 0 304 38
Council, 0 304 38
and 0 304 38
that 0 304 38
you 0 304 38
accept 0 304 38
the 0 304 38
orientations 0 304 38
that 0 304 38
have 0 304 38
been 0 304 38
given 0 304 38
by 0 304 38
Rome. 0 304 38

Mgr. 0 304 39

Benelli 0 304 40
took 0 304 40
the 0 304 40
book 0 304 40
of 0 304 40
the 0 304 40
New 0 304 40
Ordo, 0 304 40
gave 0 304 40
it 0 304 40
to 0 304 40
me, 0 304 40
and 0 304 40
said, 0 304 40
“You 0 304 40
must 0 304 40
say 0 304 40
this 0 304 40
New 0 304 40
Mass 0 304 40
in 0 304 40
all 0 304 40
of 0 304 40
your 0 304 40
houses.” 0 304 40

I 0 304 41
wonder 0 304 41
why 0 304 41
Mgr. 0 304 41

Benelli 0 304 42
did 0 304 42
not 0 304 42
communicate 0 304 42
this 0 304 42
condition 0 304 42
to 0 304 42
me 0 304 42
before 0 304 42
our 0 304 42
meeting. 0 304 42

[2] 0 304 43
He 0 304 43
could 0 304 43
have 0 304 43
done 0 304 43
so. 0 304 43

For 0 304 44
example, 0 304 44
one 0 304 44
year 0 304 44
ago 0 304 44
three 0 304 44
cardinals 0 304 44
sent 0 304 44
me 0 304 44
a 0 304 44
letter 0 304 44
(Cardinals 0 304 44
Wright, 0 304 44
Tabera 0 304 44
[Arturo 0 304 44
Carinal 0 304 44
Tabera 0 304 44
Araoz, 0 304 44
one 0 304 44
of 0 304 44
the 0 304 44
Council 0 304 44
Fathers 0 304 44
MJM], 0 304 44
and 0 304 44
Gabriel-Marie 0 304 44
Garrone) 0 304 44
telling 0 304 44
me 0 304 44
(in 0 304 44
effect) 0 304 44
that 0 304 44
I 0 304 44
must 0 304 44
close 0 304 44
the 0 304 44
seminaries. 0 304 44

Well, 0 304 45
I 0 304 45
refused, 0 304 45
because 0 304 45
I 1 304 45
refuse 1 304 45
to 1 304 45
contribute 1 304 45
to 1 304 45
the 1 304 45
destruction 1 304 45
of 1 304 45
the 1 304 45
Church. 1 304 45

Because 0 304 46
now 0 304 46
they 0 304 46
are 0 304 46
destroying 1 304 46
the 1 304 46
Church. 1 304 46

When 0 304 47
I 0 304 47
die 0 304 47
and 0 304 47
go 0 304 47
before 0 304 47
the 0 304 47
judge, 0 304 47
God 0 304 47
will 0 304 47
not 0 304 47
be 0 304 47
able 0 304 47
to 0 304 47
say 0 304 47
to 0 304 47
me, 0 304 47
“You 1 304 47
destroyed 1 304 47
the 1 304 47
Church.” 1 304 47
I 0 304 47
refused 0 304 47
to 0 304 47
contribute 0 304 47
to 0 304 47
the 0 304 47
destruction 1 304 47
of 1 304 47
the 1 304 47
Church. 1 304 47

I 0 304 48
am 0 304 48
sure 0 304 48
that 0 304 48
my 0 304 48
seminaries 0 304 48
are 0 304 48
contributing 0 304 48
to 0 304 48
the 0 304 48
restoration 0 304 48
of 0 304 48
the 0 304 48
Church. 0 304 48

I 0 304 49
do 0 304 49
not 0 304 49
destroy 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
Church. 0 304 49

And 0 304 50
so 0 304 50
I 0 304 50
said 0 304 50
to 0 304 50
Mgr. 0 304 50

Benelli, 0 304 51
“No, 0 304 51
I 0 304 51
will 0 304 51
not 0 304 51
sign 0 304 51
that 0 304 51
writing.” 0 304 51

I 0 304 52
think 0 304 52
that 0 304 52
the 1 304 52
mutation 1 304 52
in 1 304 52
the 1 304 52
Church 1 304 52
came 0 304 52
in 0 304 52
through 0 304 52
the 0 304 52
Second 0 304 52
Vatican 0 304 52
Council. 0 304 52

And 0 304 53
do 0 304 53
you 0 304 53
think 0 304 53
this 0 304 53
change 0 304 53
in 0 304 53
the 0 304 53
Church 0 304 53
came 0 304 53
suddenly? 0 304 53

When, 0 304 54
then? 0 304 54

At 0 304 55
the 0 304 55
beginning 0 304 55
of 0 304 55
the 0 304 55
Council? 0 304 55

No, 0 304 56
this 0 304 56
change 0 304 56
in 0 304 56
the 0 304 56
Church 0 304 56
began 0 304 56
one 0 304 56
century 0 304 56
before 0 304 56
[the 0 304 56
Council]. 0 304 56

Pope 0 304 57
Pius 0 304 57
VI 0 304 57
said 0 304 57
during 0 304 57
the 0 304 57
French 0 304 57
Revolution 0 304 57
that 0 304 57
if 1 304 57
the 1 304 57
Church 1 304 57
continues 1 304 57
to 1 304 57
remain 1 304 57
under 1 304 57
the 1 304 57
influence 1 304 57
of 1 304 57
the 1 304 57
prince 1 304 57
of 1 304 57
the 1 304 57
revolution, 1 304 57
then, 1 304 57
in 1 304 57
the 1 304 57
future 1 304 57
a 1 304 57
crisis 1 304 57
will 1 304 57
come 1 304 57
upon 1 304 57
the 1 304 57
Church. 1 304 57

In 0 304 58
[1844], 0 304 58
Pope 0 304 58
Pius 0 304 58
IX 0 304 58
ordered 0 304 58
Cardinal 0 304 58
Rigoli 0 304 58
to 0 304 58
publish 0 304 58
the 0 304 58
Instructions 0 304 58
of 0 304 58
the 0 304 58
Carbonari. 0 304 58

[3] 0 304 59
The 0 304 59
Pope 0 304 59
himself 0 304 59
asked 0 304 59
Cardinal 0 304 59
Rigoli 0 304 59
to 0 304 59
publish 0 304 59
the 0 304 59
Instructions 0 304 59
of 0 304 59
the 0 304 59
Carbonari. 0 304 59

And 0 304 60
what 0 304 60
did 0 304 60
these 0 304 60
Instructions 0 304 60
say? 0 304 60

The 0 304 61
Instructions 0 304 61
said 0 304 61
that 0 304 61
they 0 304 61
[the 0 304 61
Carbonari/Freemasons] 0 304 61
must 0 304 61
begin 0 304 61
to 0 304 61
fight 0 304 61
against 0 304 61
the 0 304 61
Church 0 304 61
by 0 304 61
bringing 0 304 61
reform 0 304 61
into 0 304 61
the 0 304 61
Church. 0 304 61

The 0 304 62
Instructions 0 304 62
said 0 304 62
the 0 304 62
infiltration 0 304 62
will 0 304 62
take 0 304 62
perhaps 0 304 62
not 0 304 62
one 0 304 62
year, 0 304 62
perhaps 0 304 62
not 0 304 62
ten 0 304 62
years, 0 304 62
but 0 304 62
perhaps 0 304 62
a 0 304 62
century. 0 304 62

The 0 304 63
Carbonari 0 304 63
must 0 304 63
enter 0 304 63
into 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
seminary, 0 304 63
into 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
convent, 0 304 63
into 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
sacristy, 0 304 63
and 0 304 63
slowly, 0 304 63
very 0 304 63
slowly, 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
priests 0 304 63
will 0 304 63
have 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
ideals 0 304 63
of 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
revolution; 0 304 63
of 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
Freemasons. 0 304 63

One 0 304 64
day 0 304 64
these 0 304 64
priests, 0 304 64

with 0 304 64
Masonic 0 304 64
principles, 0 304 64
will 0 304 64
become 0 304 64
bishops, 0 304 64
and 0 304 64
these 0 304 64
bishops 0 304 64
can 0 304 64
then 0 304 64
choose 0 304 64
a 0 304 64
pope. 0 304 64

And 0 304 65
even 0 304 65
if 0 304 65
the 0 304 65
pope 0 304 65
is 0 304 65
not 0 304 65
a 0 304 65
Freemason, 0 304 65
he 0 304 65
will 0 304 65
have 0 304 65
the 0 304 65
same 0 304 65
ideals 0 304 65
as 0 304 65
the 0 304 65
Freemasons. 0 304 65

Pope 0 304 66
Pius 0 304 66
IX 0 304 66
called 0 304 66
for 0 304 66
the 0 304 66
publishing 0 304 66
of 0 304 66
these 0 304 66
Instructions 0 304 66
in 0 304 66
order 0 304 66
to 0 304 66
warn 0 304 66
the 0 304 66
bishops 0 304 66
and 0 304 66
priests 0 304 66
of 0 304 66
those 0 304 66
times 0 304 66
of 0 304 66
the 0 304 66
fight 0 304 66
against 0 304 66
the 0 304 66
church. 0 304 66

In 0 304 67
1895, 0 304 67
the 0 304 67
Catholic 0 304 67
Antonia 0 304 67
Fogazzaro, 0 304 67
a 0 304 67
known 0 304 67
modernist, 0 304 67
founded 0 304 67
a 0 304 67
masonic 0 304 67
lodge 0 304 67
in 0 304 67
Milan. 0 304 67

He 0 304 68
wrote 0 304 68
in 0 304 68
his 0 304 68
book, 0 304 68
Il 0 304 68
Santo, 0 304 68
that 0 304 68
“We 0 304 68
[modernists]…want 0 304 68
a 0 304 68
reform 0 304 68
in 0 304 68
the 0 304 68
Church…without 0 304 68
rebellion, 0 304 68
carried 0 304 68
out 0 304 68
by 0 304 68
legitimate 0 304 68
authority…even 0 304 68
if 0 304 68
this 0 304 68
takes 0 304 68
20, 0 304 68
30, 0 304 68
or 0 304 68
50 0 304 68
years.”[4] 0 304 68
“The 0 304 68
reform 0 304 68
will 0 304 68
have 0 304 68
to 0 304 68
be 0 304 68
brought 0 304 68
about 0 304 68
in 0 304 68
the 0 304 68
name 0 304 68
of 0 304 68
obedience.” 0 304 68
The 0 304 68
modernist 0 304 68
ideas 0 304 68
in 0 304 68
the 0 304 68
Church 0 304 68
introduced 0 304 68
and 0 304 68
enacted 0 304 68
through 0 304 68
obedience! 0 304 68

And 0 304 69
I 0 304 69
think…well, 0 304 69
here 0 304 69
we 0 304 69
are! 0 304 69

In 0 304 70
this 0 304 70
time! 0 304 70

The 0 304 71
reform 0 304 71
is 0 304 71
here, 0 304 71
and 0 304 71
it 0 304 71
is 0 304 71
brought 0 304 71
about 0 304 71
through 0 304 71
obedience, 0 304 71
to 0 304 71
the 0 304 71
Council, 0 304 71
to 0 304 71
the 0 304 71
bishop, 0 304 71
to 0 304 71
the 0 304 71
priest. 0 304 71

And 0 304 72
all 0 304 72
they 0 304 72
say 0 304 72
is 0 304 72
“Obedience, 0 304 72
obedience, 0 304 72
obedience.” 0 304 72

The 0 304 73
Instructions 0 304 73
of 0 304 73
the 0 304 73
Carbonari 0 304 73
say 0 304 73
the 0 304 73
bishop 0 304 73
and 0 304 73
the 0 304 73
priest 0 304 73
will 0 304 73
think 0 304 73
that 0 304 73
they 0 304 73
are 0 304 73
following 0 304 73
the 0 304 73
tiara 0 304 73
of 0 304 73
the 0 304 73
Pope, 0 304 73
but 0 304 73
they 0 304 73
will 0 304 73
be 0 304 73
following 0 304 73
the 0 304 73
flag 0 304 73
of 0 304 73
Freemasonry 0 304 73
[“the 0 304 73
banner 0 304 73
of 0 304 73
revolution”]. 0 304 73

They 1 304 74
said 1 304 74
that. 1 304 74

They 1 304 75
wrote 1 304 75
that! 1 304 75

One 0 304 76
century 0 304 76
before 0 304 76
[the 0 304 76
Council]! 0 304 76

Thus, 0 304 77
it 0 304 77
is 0 304 77
very 0 304 77
important 0 304 77
to 0 304 77
know 0 304 77
that 0 304 77
they 0 304 77
prepared 0 304 77
for 0 304 77
the 0 304 77
beginning 0 304 77
of 0 304 77
the 0 304 77
Second 0 304 77
Vatican 0 304 77
Council 0 304 77
for 0 304 77
a 0 304 77
century, 0 304 77
perhaps 0 304 77
two 0 304 77
centuries! 0 304 77

As 0 304 78
the 0 304 78
Archbishop 0 304 78
of 0 304 78
Dakar 0 304 78
and 0 304 78
President 0 304 78
of 0 304 78
the 0 304 78
Episcopal 0 304 78
Commission 0 304 78
for 0 304 78
French-speaking 0 304 78
West 0 304 78
Africa, 0 304 78
I 0 304 78
was 0 304 78
appointed 0 304 78
member 0 304 78
of 0 304 78
the 0 304 78
Central 0 304 78
Preparatory 0 304 78
Commission 0 304 78
of 0 304 78
the 0 304 78
Second 0 304 78
Vatican 0 304 78
Council. 0 304 78

There 0 304 79
were 0 304 79
some 0 304 79
seventy 0 304 79
cardinals, 0 304 79
twenty 0 304 79
bishops, 0 304 79
and 0 304 79
four 0 304 79
super-authorities 0 304 79
of 0 304 79
the 0 304 79
religious 0 304 79
orders, 0 304 79
among 0 304 79
others. 0 304 79

Before 0 304 80
the 0 304 80
last 0 304 80
meeting 0 304 80
of 0 304 80
this 0 304 80
Commission 0 304 80
the 0 304 80
members 0 304 80
received 0 304 80
two 0 304 80
schemas 0 304 80
on 0 304 80
the 0 304 80
same 0 304 80
subject: 0 304 80
one 0 304 80
from 0 304 80
Cardinal 0 304 80
Ottaviani 0 304 80
and 0 304 80
another 0 304 80
from 0 304 80
Cardinal 0 304 80
Bea. 0 304 80

The 0 304 81
schema 0 304 81
from 0 304 81
Cardinal 0 304 81
Ottaviani 0 304 81
was 0 304 81
titled 0 304 81
“…On 0 304 81
Religious 0 304 81
Tolerance” 0 304 81
and 0 304 81
the 0 304 81
other, 0 304 81
from 0 304 81
Cardinal 0 304 81
Bea, 0 304 81
was 0 304 81
titled 0 304 81
“On 0 304 81
Religious 0 304 81
Freedom 0 304 81
[Liberty].” 0 304 81
When 0 304 81
we 0 304 81
read 0 304 81
these 0 304 81
two 0 304 81
schemas, 0 304 81
we 0 304 81
thought, 0 304 81
“This 0 304 81
is 0 304 81
impossible. 0 304 81

How 0 304 82
is 0 304 82
it 0 304 82
we 0 304 82
can 0 304 82
receive 0 304 82
two 0 304 82
opposing 0 304 82
theses? 0 304 82

One 0 304 83
says 0 304 83
we 0 304 83
must 0 304 83
not 0 304 83
tolerate 0 304 83
error. 0 304 83

The 0 304 84
other 0 304 84
says 0 304 84
that 0 304 84
error 0 304 84
has 0 304 84
the 0 304 84
right 0 304 84
to 0 304 84
exist 0 304 84
in 0 304 84
the 0 304 84
name 0 304 84
of 0 304 84
the 0 304 84
dignity 0 304 84
of 0 304 84
the 0 304 84
human 0 304 84
person.” 0 304 84
And 0 304 84
so, 0 304 84
we 0 304 84
go 0 304 84
into 0 304 84
the 0 304 84
meeting. 0 304 84

Cardinal 0 304 85
Ottaviani, 0 304 85
standing, 0 304 85
says 0 304 85
to 0 304 85
Cardinal 0 304 85
Bea, 0 304 85
“You 1 304 85
have 1 304 85
no 1 304 85
authority 1 304 85
to 1 304 85
compose 1 304 85
this 1 304 85
schema, 1 304 85
because 1 304 85
it 1 304 85
is 1 304 85
a 1 304 85
theological 1 304 85
thesis 1 304 85
and 1 304 85
therefore 1 304 85
within 1 304 85
the 1 304 85
competence 1 304 85
of 1 304 85
the 1 304 85
Theological 1 304 85
Commission.” 1 304 85
As 0 304 85
Cardinal 0 304 85
Bea 0 304 85
stands 0 304 85
up, 0 304 85
he 0 304 85
says, 0 304 85
“I 0 304 85
do 1 304 85
have 1 304 85
the 1 304 85
right 1 304 85
to 1 304 85
compose 1 304 85
this 1 304 85
schema 1 304 85
because 1 304 85
if 1 304 85
anything 1 304 85
concerns 1 304 85
Christian 1 304 85
Unity 1 304 85
it 1 304 85
is 1 304 85
religious 1 304 85
liberty, 1 304 85
and 1 304 85
I 1 304 85
am 1 304 85
the 1 304 85
President 1 304 85
of 1 304 85
the 1 304 85
Secretariat 1 304 85
for 1 304 85
Promoting 1 304 85
Christian 1 304 85
Unity.” 1 304 85
Cardinal 0 304 85
Bea, 0 304 85
addressing 0 304 85
Cardinal 0 304 85
Ottaviani, 0 304 85
further 0 304 85
said, 0 304 85
“I 0 304 85
am 0 304 85
opposed 0 304 85
to 0 304 85
your 0 304 85
schema.” 0 304 85

Impossible! 1 304 86

We 1 304 87
were 1 304 87
in 1 304 87
a 1 304 87
very 1 304 87
sad, 1 304 87
serious 1 304 87
situation. 1 304 87

Cardinal 0 304 88
Ruffini 0 304 88
had 0 304 88
to 0 304 88
intervene 0 304 88
as 0 304 88
we 0 304 88
were 0 304 88
in 0 304 88
front 0 304 88
of 0 304 88
two 0 304 88
cardinals, 0 304 88
our 0 304 88
brothers. 0 304 88

He 0 304 89
said 0 304 89
we 0 304 89
must 0 304 89
wait 0 304 89
for 0 304 89
the 0 304 89
authority 0 304 89
to 0 304 89
say 0 304 89
who 0 304 89
is 0 304 89
right 0 304 89
and 0 304 89
who 0 304 89
is 0 304 89
wrong. 0 304 89

But 0 304 90
before 0 304 90
the 0 304 90
Pope 0 304 90
came 0 304 90
(because 0 304 90
the 0 304 90
Pope 0 304 90
came 0 304 90
many 0 304 90
times 0 304 90
to 0 304 90
present 0 304 90
at 0 304 90
these 0 304 90
meetings) 0 304 90
we 0 304 90
voted 0 304 90
on 0 304 90
the 0 304 90
schema. 0 304 90

Who 0 304 91
is 0 304 91
with 0 304 91
Cardinal 0 304 91
Ottaviani? 0 304 91

Who 0 304 92
is 0 304 92
with 0 304 92
Cardinal 0 304 92
Bea? 0 304 92

The 0 304 93
conservatives 0 304 93
and 0 304 93
the 0 304 93
liberals. 0 304 93

As 0 304 94
the 0 304 94
last 0 304 94
meeting 0 304 94
of 0 304 94
the 0 304 94
Preparatory 0 304 94
Commission, 0 304 94
it 0 304 94
was 0 304 94
for 0 304 94
me 0 304 94
the 0 304 94
first 0 304 94
image 0 304 94
of 0 304 94
the 0 304 94
future 0 304 94
Council. 0 304 94

This 0 304 95
historic 0 304 95
address 0 304 95
appeared 0 304 95
for 0 304 95
the 0 304 95
first 0 304 95
time 0 304 95
ever 0 304 95
in 0 304 95

Isn't 0 304 96
it 0 304 96
time 0 304 96
for 0 304 96
you 0 304 96
to 0 304 96
subscribe? 0 304 96

And 0 304 97
as 0 304 97
we 0 304 97
go 0 304 97
into 0 304 97
the 0 304 97
Council, 0 304 97
you 0 304 97
know 0 304 97
that 0 304 97
on 0 304 97
the 0 304 97
first 0 304 97
day 0 304 97
of 0 304 97
the 0 304 97
Council, 0 304 97
Cardinal 0 304 97
Lienart 0 304 97
was 0 304 97
the 0 304 97
chief 0 304 97
of 0 304 97
the 0 304 97

[together] 0 304 97
with 0 304 97
all 0 304 97
of 0 304 97
the 0 304 97

now 0 304 98
one 0 304 98
month 0 304 98

inscription 0 304 98
in 0 304 98
Masonry, 0 304 98
the 0 304 98
date 0 304 98
[of 0 304 98
his 0 304 98
rising 0 304 98
to] 0 304 98
the 0 304 98
20th 0 304 98
Degree 0 304 98
of 0 304 98
Freemasonry, 1 304 98
the 0 304 98
date 0 304 98
[of 0 304 98
his 0 304 98
rising 0 304 98
to] 0 304 98
the 0 304 98
30th 0 304 98
Degree 0 304 98
of 0 304 98
Freemasonry, 1 304 98
and 0 304 98
the 0 304 98
places 0 304 98
where 0 304 98
he 0 304 98
[attended] 0 304 98
the 0 304 98
meetings 0 304 98
of 0 304 98
Freemasonry. 1 304 98

This 0 304 99
Cardinal 0 304 99
was 0 304 99
the 0 304 99
chief 0 304 99
of 0 304 99
the 0 304 99
liberals 0 304 99
in 0 304 99
the 0 304 99
Council. 0 304 99

That 0 304 100
is 0 304 100
my 0 304 100
cardinal; 0 304 100
he 0 304 100
ordained 0 304 100
me 0 304 100
to 0 304 100
the 0 304 100
priesthood, 0 304 100
and 0 304 100
he 0 304 100
consecrated 0 304 100
me 0 304 100
a 0 304 100
bishop. 0 304 100

And 0 304 101
now 0 304 101
this 0 304 101
is 0 304 101
public. 0 304 101

Nobody 0 304 102
has 0 304 102
been 0 304 102
able 0 304 102
to 0 304 102
refute 0 304 102
the 0 304 102
publication. 0 304 102

And 0 304 103
so, 0 304 103
we 0 304 103
have 0 304 103
(I 0 304 103
am 0 304 103
confident) 0 304 103
a 1 304 103
mutation 1 304 103
in 1 304 103
the 1 304 103
church 1 304 103
by 0 304 103
the 0 304 103
Council 0 304 103
and 0 304 103
by 0 304 103
the 0 304 103
reform 0 304 103
after 0 304 103
the 0 304 103
Council. 0 304 103

Now, 0 304 104
some 0 304 104
say 0 304 104
the 0 304 104
Council 0 304 104
is 0 304 104
(was) 0 304 104
good, 0 304 104
but 0 304 104
only 0 304 104
the 0 304 104
reforms 0 304 104
were 0 304 104
bad. 0 304 104

That 0 304 105
is 0 304 105
not 0 304 105
true. 0 304 105

Why? 0 304 106

Because 0 304 107
when 0 304 107
the 0 304 107
reforms 0 304 107
come, 0 304 107
Rome 0 304 107
always 0 304 107
says 0 304 107
the 0 304 107
reforms 0 304 107
are 0 304 107
being 0 304 107
done 0 304 107
in 0 304 107
the 0 304 107
name 0 304 107
of 0 304 107
the 0 304 107
Council. 0 304 107

In 1 304 108
the 1 304 108
name 1 304 108
of 1 304 108
the 1 304 108
Council! 1 304 108

It 0 304 109
is 0 304 109
evident 0 304 109
that 0 304 109
all 0 304 109
of 0 304 109
the 0 304 109
reforms 0 304 109
came 0 304 109
from 0 304 109
the 0 304 109
Council. 0 304 109

And 0 304 110
if 1 304 110
the 1 304 110
reforms 1 304 110
are 1 304 110
bad, 1 304 110
then 1 304 110
it 1 304 110
is 1 304 110
impossible 1 304 110
that 1 304 110
the 1 304 110
Council 1 304 110
is 1 304 110
good 1 304 110
and 1 304 110
all 1 304 110
the 1 304 110
reforms 1 304 110
are 1 304 110
bad, 1 304 110
because 1 304 110
that 1 304 110
is 1 304 110
the 1 304 110
authentic 1 304 110
interpretation 1 304 110
of 1 304 110
the 1 304 110
Council 1 304 110
by 1 304 110
Rome. 1 304 110

Rome 0 304 111
said 0 304 111
in 0 304 111
the 0 304 111
name 0 304 111
of 0 304 111
the 0 304 111
Declaration 0 304 111
of 0 304 111
Liturgy, 0 304 111
we 0 304 111
[implement] 0 304 111
the 0 304 111
liturgical 0 304 111
reform. 0 304 111

We 0 304 112
can 0 304 112
say 0 304 112
that 0 304 112
[these 0 304 112
bad 0 304 112
changes 0 304 112
are] 0 304 112
not 0 304 112
in 0 304 112
the 0 304 112
text 0 304 112
of 0 304 112
the 0 304 112
Declaration, 0 304 112
but 0 304 112
this 0 304 112
man 0 304 112
has 0 304 112
the 0 304 112
authority 0 304 112
to 0 304 112
say 0 304 112
that 0 304 112
this 0 304 112
is 0 304 112
from 0 304 112
the 0 304 112
Council. 0 304 112

They 0 304 113
know 0 304 113
that. 0 304 113

And 0 304 114
I 0 304 114
am 0 304 114
sure 0 304 114
that 0 304 114
it 0 304 114
[the 0 304 114
mutation] 0 304 114
is 0 304 114
in 0 304 114
the 0 304 114
Council. 0 304 114

Even 0 304 115
if 0 304 115
it 0 304 115
is 0 304 115
not 0 304 115
explicitly 0 304 115
[stated] 0 304 115
in 0 304 115
the 0 304 115
Council 0 304 115
but 0 304 115
[rather] 0 304 115
in 0 304 115
the 0 304 115
spirit 0 304 115
of 0 304 115
the 0 304 115
Council, 0 304 115
it 0 304 115
is 0 304 115
the 0 304 115
same! 0 304 115

For 0 304 116
example, 0 304 116
with 0 304 116
religious 0 304 116
freedom: 0 304 116
now 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
Holy 0 304 116
See 0 304 116
and 0 304 116
all 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
Nuncios 0 304 116
are 0 304 116
against 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
Catholic 0 304 116
State 0 304 116
in 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
name 0 304 116
of 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
Council 0 304 116
- 0 304 116
in 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
name 0 304 116
of 0 304 116
the 0 304 116
Declaration 0 304 116
of 0 304 116
Religious 0 304 116
Freedom. 0 304 116

I 0 304 117
have 0 304 117
heard 0 304 117
this 0 304 117
(personally) 0 304 117
twice. 0 304 117

The 0 304 118
first 0 304 118
time 0 304 118
I 0 304 118
was 0 304 118
in 0 304 118
Columbia. 0 304 118

When 0 304 119
I 0 304 119
was 0 304 119
in 0 304 119
Columbia, 0 304 119
I 0 304 119
read 0 304 119
in 0 304 119
the 0 304 119
paper 0 304 119
about 0 304 119
the 0 304 119
change 0 304 119
in 0 304 119
the 0 304 119
first 0 304 119
article 0 304 119
of 0 304 119
the 0 304 119
Constitution 0 304 119
of 0 304 119
the 0 304 119
Republic 0 304 119
of 0 304 119
Columbia. 0 304 119

[The 0 304 120
first 0 304 120
article] 0 304 120
stated 0 304 120
that 0 304 120
only 0 304 120
the 0 304 120
Republic 0 304 120
of 0 304 120
Columbia 0 304 120
recognizes 0 304 120
only 0 304 120
the 0 304 120
Catholic 0 304 120
religion. 0 304 120

They 0 304 121
changed 0 304 121
it. 0 304 121

They 0 304 122
removed 0 304 122
this 0 304 122
article. 0 304 122

I 0 304 123
read 0 304 123
the 0 304 123
discourse 0 304 123
of 0 304 123
the 0 304 123
President 0 304 123
of 0 304 123
Columbia 0 304 123
with 0 304 123
the 0 304 123
Nuncios 0 304 123
of 0 304 123
Columbia 0 304 123
and 0 304 123
the 0 304 123
Secretary 0 304 123
of 0 304 123
the 0 304 123
Episcopal 0 304 123
Conference 0 304 123
in 0 304 123
Columbia. 0 304 123

The 0 304 124
President 0 304 124
said 0 304 124
he 0 304 124
is 0 304 124
very, 1 304 124
very 1 304 124
anxious. 1 304 124

He 0 304 125
said 0 304 125
to 0 304 125
the 0 304 125
people, 0 304 125
“even 0 304 125
though 0 304 125
we 0 304 125
remove 0 304 125
this 0 304 125
article 0 304 125
we 0 304 125
remain 0 304 125
Catholic. 0 304 125

I 0 304 126
am 0 304 126
a 0 304 126
Catholic, 0 304 126
I 0 304 126
shall 0 304 126
remain 0 304 126
Catholic, 0 304 126
and 0 304 126
I 1 304 126
do 1 304 126
everything 1 304 126
possible 1 304 126
for 1 304 126
the 1 304 126
Council 1 304 126
and 1 304 126
the 1 304 126
Catholics 1 304 126
in 1 304 126
our 1 304 126
country.” 1 304 126

Then, 0 304 127
the 0 304 127
discourse 0 304 127
of 0 304 127
the 0 304 127
Nuncio 0 304 127
was 0 304 127
the 0 304 127
discourse 0 304 127
of 0 304 127
a 0 304 127
Freemason: 0 304 127
all 0 304 127
of 0 304 127
it 0 304 127
was 0 304 127
“progress,” 0 304 127
“humanity,” 0 304 127
“evolution,” 0 304 127
and 0 304 127
all 0 304 127
the 0 304 127
hubris 0 304 127
of 0 304 127
a 0 304 127
Freemason. 0 304 127

And 0 304 128
during 0 304 128
the 0 304 128
discourse 0 304 128
of 0 304 128
the 0 304 128
Secretary 0 304 128
of 0 304 128
the 0 304 128
Episcopal 0 304 128
Conference, 0 304 128
[the 0 304 128
Secretary] 0 304 128
said, 0 304 128
“in 1 304 128
the 1 304 128
name 1 304 128
of 1 304 128
the 1 304 128
Declaration 1 304 128
of 1 304 128
Religious 1 304 128
Freedom 1 304 128
[of 1 304 128
Vatican 1 304 128
II], 1 304 128
we 1 304 128
ask 1 304 128
the 1 304 128
President 1 304 128
to 1 304 128
remove 1 304 128
this 1 304 128
article 1 304 128
in 1 304 128
the 1 304 128
Constitution.” 1 304 128

I 0 304 129
met 0 304 129
this 0 304 129
Secretary 0 304 129
of 0 304 129
the 0 304 129
Episcopal 0 304 129
Conference 0 304 129
during 0 304 129
my 0 304 129
visit 0 304 129
in 0 304 129
Columbia, 0 304 129
and 0 304 129
he 0 304 129
said 0 304 129
for 0 304 129
two 0 304 129
years 0 304 129
they 0 304 129
[had 0 304 129
been 0 304 129
asking] 0 304 129
the 0 304 129
President, 0 304 129
in 1 304 129
the 1 304 129
name 1 304 129
of 1 304 129
the 1 304 129
Holy 1 304 129
See, 1 304 129
to 0 304 129
change 0 304 129
this 0 304 129
article 0 304 129
in 0 304 129
their 0 304 129
Constitution. 0 304 129

But 0 304 130
I 0 304 130
will 0 304 130
never…I 0 304 130
do 0 304 130
not 0 304 130
accept 0 304 130
the 0 304 130
concept, 0 304 130
because 0 304 130
you 0 304 130
destroy 0 304 130
the 0 304 130
Catholic 0 304 130
State 0 304 130
in 0 304 130
the 0 304 130
name 0 304 130
of 0 304 130
the 0 304 130
Council. 0 304 130

Are 0 304 131
you 0 304 131
sure? 0 304 131

Yes, 0 304 132
sure. 0 304 132

It 0 304 133
is 0 304 133
evident. 0 304 133

Now 0 304 134
I 0 304 134
said 0 304 134
to 0 304 134
the 0 304 134
[Secretary], 0 304 134
“As 0 304 134
I 0 304 134
speak 0 304 134
with 0 304 134
you 0 304 134
now 0 304 134
about 0 304 134
Columbia, 0 304 134
I 0 304 134
know 0 304 134
that 0 304 134
you 0 304 134
are 0 304 134
the 0 304 134
one 0 304 134
responsible 0 304 134
for 0 304 134
the 0 304 134
change 0 304 134
in 0 304 134
the 0 304 134
constitution 0 304 134
of 0 304 134
Valais 0 304 134
in 0 304 134
Switzerland 0 304 134
one 0 304 134
year 0 304 134
ago. 0 304 134

The 0 304 135
change 0 304 135
in 0 304 135
the 0 304 135
Constitution 0 304 135
of 0 304 135
Valais 0 304 135
was 0 304 135
the 0 304 135
same.” 0 304 135
(Because 0 304 135
you 0 304 135
know 0 304 135
Switzerland 0 304 135
is 0 304 135
a 0 304 135
Federation 0 304 135
where 0 304 135
some 0 304 135
states 0 304 135

And 0 304 138
[the 0 304 138

said, 0 304 138
“Yes, 0 304 138
I 0 304 138
am 0 304 138
responsible 0 304 138

this 0 304 138
change.” 0 304 138
Brother, 0 304 138
what 0 304 138
did 0 304 138
you 0 304 138
do 0 304 138
with 0 304 138
the 0 304 138
Social 0 304 138
Kingship 0 304 138
of 0 304 138
Christ? 0 304 138

What 0 304 139
is 0 304 139
this 0 304 139
for 0 304 139
you? 0 304 139

What 0 304 140
do 0 304 140
you 0 304 140
say 0 304 140
when 0 304 140
you 0 304 140
say 0 304 140
“thy 0 304 140
kingdom 0 304 140
come” 0 304 140
in 0 304 140
your 0 304 140
prayer, 0 304 140
the 0 304 140
Our 0 304 140
Father? 0 304 140

“Ah,” 0 304 141
the 0 304 141
Nuncio 0 304 141
said 0 304 141
to 0 304 141
me, 0 304 141
“Now 0 304 141
it 0 304 141
is 0 304 141
impossible.” 0 304 141
What 0 304 141
did 0 304 141
you 0 304 141
do 0 304 141
with 0 304 141
the 0 304 141
encyclical 0 304 141
of 0 304 141
Pope 0 304 141
Pius 0 304 141
XI, 0 304 141
Quas 0 304 141
Primas? 0 304 141

“Ah, 0 304 142
but 0 304 142
now 0 304 142
the 0 304 142
Pope 0 304 142
cannot 0 304 142
write 0 304 142
an 0 304 142
encyclical 0 304 142
like 0 304 142
Quas 0 304 142
Primas.” 0 304 142

It 0 304 143
is 0 304 143
incredible. 0 304 143

And 0 304 144
all 0 304 144
in 1 304 144
the 1 304 144
name 1 304 144
of 1 304 144
the 1 304 144
Council. 1 304 144

We 1 304 145
must 1 304 145
take 1 304 145
care, 1 304 145
because 1 304 145
this 1 304 145
change 1 304 145
in 1 304 145
the 1 304 145
church 1 304 145
is 1 304 145
a 1 304 145
liberal 1 304 145
change. 1 304 145

The 1 304 146
liberal 1 304 146
principles 1 304 146
have 1 304 146
entered 1 304 146
the 1 304 146
Church 1 304 146
now, 1 304 146
and 1 304 146
they 1 304 146
destroy 1 304 146
the 1 304 146
Church. 1 304 146

If 0 304 147
we 0 304 147
cannot 0 304 147
set 0 304 147
out 0 304 147
the 0 304 147
true 0 304 147
principles 0 304 147
of 0 304 147
the 0 304 147
Church, 0 304 147
if 0 304 147
we 0 304 147
in 0 304 147
the 0 304 147
name 0 304 147
of 0 304 147
religious 0 304 147
freedom 0 304 147
said 0 304 147
that 0 304 147
all 0 304 147
religions 0 304 147
have 0 304 147
the 0 304 147
same 0 304 147
right 0 304 147
in 0 304 147
every 0 304 147
state 0 304 147
in 0 304 147
the 0 304 147
world… 0 304 147

[missing 0 304 148
audio...] 0 304 148

The 0 304 149
truth 0 304 149
is 0 304 149
the 0 304 149
only 0 304 149
one 0 304 149
King 0 304 149
of 0 304 149
the 0 304 149
World 0 304 149
is 0 304 149
Jesus 0 304 149
Christ. 0 304 149

We 0 304 150
say 0 304 150
in 0 304 150
the 0 304 150
Gloria 0 304 150
in 0 304 150
Excelsis 0 304 150
Deo, 0 304 150
“Tu 0 304 150
solus 0 304 150
Altissimus,” 0 304 150
“Tu 0 304 150
solus 0 304 150
Dominus,” 0 304 150
“You 0 304 150
alone 0 304 150
are 0 304 150
the 0 304 150
Highest,” 0 304 150
“You 0 304 150
alone 0 304 150
are 0 304 150
the 0 304 150
Lord.” 0 304 150
But 0 304 150
practically, 0 304 150
we 0 304 150
would 0 304 150
refuse 0 304 150
this 0 304 150
Kingdom 0 304 150
of 0 304 150
Jesus 0 304 150
Christ 0 304 150
if 0 304 150
we 0 304 150
said 0 304 150
that 0 304 150
Luther, 0 304 150
Mohammed, 0 304 150
Buddha 0 304 150
and 0 304 150
Jesus 0 304 150
Christ 0 304 150
are 0 304 150
all 0 304 150
the 0 304 150
same. 0 304 150

We 0 304 151
cannot 0 304 151
say 0 304 151
that. 0 304 151

Impossible. 1 304 152

We 0 304 153
know 0 304 153
that 0 304 153
in 0 304 153
many 0 304 153
states 0 304 153
(it 0 304 153
is 0 304 153
a 0 304 153
pity) 0 304 153
it 0 304 153
is 0 304 153
impossible 0 304 153
[to 0 304 153
recognize 0 304 153
Catholicism 0 304 153
as 0 304 153
the 0 304 153
state 0 304 153
religion]. 0 304 153

We 1 304 154
must 1 304 154
tolerate 1 304 154
- 1 304 154
have 1 304 154
tolerance 1 304 154
for 1 304 154
the 1 304 154
error 1 304 154
- 1 304 154
but 1 304 154
never 1 304 154
give 1 304 154
the 1 304 154
same 1 304 154
right 1 304 154
to 1 304 154
error 1 304 154
and 1 304 154
truth. 1 304 154

That 1 304 155
is 1 304 155
impossible. 1 304 155

And 0 304 156
the 0 304 156
change 0 304 156
in 0 304 156
the 0 304 156
liturgy 0 304 156
is 0 304 156
very 0 304 156
important. 0 304 156

It 0 304 157
is 0 304 157
very 0 304 157
bad. 0 304 157

One 0 304 158
of 0 304 158
the 0 304 158
principles 0 304 158
of 0 304 158
modern 0 304 158
man, 0 304 158
as 0 304 158
they 0 304 158
say 0 304 158
now, 0 304 158
“modern 0 304 158
man,” 0 304 158
is 0 304 158
democracy. 0 304 158

And 0 304 159
democracy 0 304 159
can 0 304 159
have 0 304 159
a 0 304 159
good 0 304 159
sense 0 304 159
but 0 304 159
not 0 304 159
if 0 304 159
[by 0 304 159
that 0 304 159
term 0 304 159
is 0 304 159
meant] 0 304 159
that 0 304 159
those 0 304 159
who 0 304 159
govern 0 304 159
receive 0 304 159
their 0 304 159
authority 0 304 159
from 0 304 159
the 0 304 159
people. 0 304 159

The 1 304 160
authority 1 304 160
comes 1 304 160
from 1 304 160
God. 1 304 160

Not 1 304 161
from 1 304 161
the 1 304 161
people. 1 304 161

Not 1 304 162
from 1 304 162
the 1 304 162
masses. 1 304 162

From 1 304 163
God. 1 304 163

But 0 304 164
today 0 304 164
the 0 304 164
principle, 0 304 164
the 0 304 164
democratic 1 304 164
principle, 1 304 164
is 0 304 164
that 0 304 164
the 0 304 164
authority 0 304 164
is 0 304 164
in 0 304 164
the 0 304 164
people. 0 304 164

It 0 304 165
is 0 304 165
in 1 304 165
the 1 304 165
masses. 1 304 165

That 0 304 166
is 0 304 166
not 0 304 166
true. 0 304 166

It 0 304 167
is 0 304 167
impossible. 0 304 167

And 0 304 168
our 0 304 168
liturgy 0 304 168
is 0 304 168
the 0 304 168
school 0 304 168
of 0 304 168
our 0 304 168
Faith. 0 304 168

It 0 304 169
is 0 304 169
the 0 304 169
first 0 304 169
school 0 304 169
of 0 304 169
our 0 304 169
Faith 0 304 169
for 0 304 169
all 0 304 169
people. 0 304 169

I 0 304 170
was 0 304 170
in 0 304 170
Africa 0 304 170
as 0 304 170
a 0 304 170
missionary 0 304 170
and 0 304 170
as 0 304 170
bishop 0 304 170
for 0 304 170
30 0 304 170
years. 0 304 170

I 0 304 171
know 0 304 171
the 0 304 171
liturgy 0 304 171
was 0 304 171
the 0 304 171
best 0 304 171
school 0 304 171
of 0 304 171
the 0 304 171
Faith 0 304 171
for 0 304 171
people 0 304 171
who 0 304 171
cannot 0 304 171
read. 0 304 171

They 0 304 172
can 0 304 172
see 0 304 172
what 0 304 172
the 0 304 172
priest 0 304 172
does. 0 304 172

They 0 304 173
can 0 304 173
see 0 304 173
what 0 304 173
the 0 304 173
priest 0 304 173
does 0 304 173
at 0 304 173
the 0 304 173
adoration 0 304 173
of 0 304 173
the 0 304 173
Body 0 304 173
and 0 304 173
the 0 304 173
Blood 0 304 173
of 0 304 173
Jesus 0 304 173
Christ. 0 304 173

And 0 304 174
they 0 304 174
know 0 304 174
that 0 304 174
Jesus 0 304 174
Christ 0 304 174
is 0 304 174
present 0 304 174
- 0 304 174
His 0 304 174
real 0 304 174
presence 0 304 174
is 0 304 174
on 0 304 174
the 0 304 174
altar 0 304 174
- 0 304 174
by 0 304 174
the 0 304 174
attitude 0 304 174
of 0 304 174
the 0 304 174
priest. 0 304 174

They 0 304 175
know 0 304 175
that. 0 304 175

That 0 304 176
is 0 304 176
very 0 304 176
important. 0 304 176

But 0 304 177
the 0 304 177
change 0 304 177
in 0 304 177
the 0 304 177
Mass 0 304 177
destroys 1 304 177
the 1 304 177
Church. 1 304 177

Because 0 304 178
we 0 304 178
know 0 304 178
the 0 304 178
liturgy 0 304 178
teaches 0 304 178
us 0 304 178
hierarchy. 0 304 178

The 0 304 179
true 0 304 179
liturgy 0 304 179
is 0 304 179
hierarchical. 0 304 179

It 0 304 180
is 0 304 180
not 0 304 180
democratic 0 304 180
but 0 304 180
hierarchical. 1 304 180

Why? 0 304 181

Because 0 304 182
we 0 304 182
have 0 304 182
God, 0 304 182
the 0 304 182
priest, 0 304 182
and 0 304 182
then 0 304 182
the 0 304 182
people. 0 304 182

That 0 304 183
is 0 304 183
hierarchy. 0 304 183

When 0 304 184
we 0 304 184
are 0 304 184
in 0 304 184
Church 0 304 184
we 0 304 184
know 0 304 184
God 0 304 184
is 0 304 184
on 0 304 184
the 0 304 184
altar; 0 304 184
the 0 304 184
priest 0 304 184
is 0 304 184
between 0 304 184
God 0 304 184
and 0 304 184
the 0 304 184
people; 0 304 184
and 0 304 184
the 0 304 184
people 0 304 184
receive 0 304 184
God 0 304 184
at 0 304 184
the 0 304 184
hand 0 304 184
of 0 304 184
the 0 304 184
priest. 0 304 184

That 1 304 185
is 1 304 185
hierarchy. 1 304 185

But 0 304 186
now 0 304 186
the 0 304 186
new 0 304 186
liturgy 0 304 186
is 0 304 186
more 0 304 186
democratic 0 304 186
- 0 304 186
all 0 304 186
around 0 304 186
the 0 304 186
table. 0 304 186

The 0 304 187
priest 0 304 187
is 0 304 187
only 0 304 187
the 0 304 187
president, 0 304 187
and 0 304 187
sometimes 0 304 187
another 0 304 187
man 0 304 187
can 0 304 187
take 0 304 187
the 0 304 187
role 0 304 187
of 0 304 187
the 0 304 187
president 0 304 187
of 0 304 187
the 0 304 187
meal. 0 304 187

That 0 304 188
is 0 304 188
a 0 304 188
new 0 304 188
liturgy. 0 304 188

That 0 304 189
is 0 304 189
very 0 304 189
bad, 0 304 189
because 0 304 189
we 0 304 189
have 0 304 189
no 0 304 189
sense 0 304 189
of 0 304 189
the 0 304 189
hierarchical; 0 304 189
whereas 0 304 189
the 0 304 189
sense 0 304 189
of 0 304 189
hierarchy 0 304 189
is 0 304 189
very 0 304 189
important 0 304 189
in 0 304 189
our 0 304 189
life. 0 304 189

We 0 304 190
need 0 304 190
the 0 304 190
authority 0 304 190
of 0 304 190
God. 0 304 190

We 0 304 191
need 0 304 191
the 0 304 191
Real 0 304 191
Presence 0 304 191
of 0 304 191
God 0 304 191
on 0 304 191
our 0 304 191
altar. 0 304 191

We 0 304 192
need 0 304 192
the 0 304 192
Sacrifice 0 304 192
of 0 304 192
the 0 304 192
Mass 0 304 192
– 0 304 192
not 0 304 192
a 0 304 192
meal 0 304 192
only 0 304 192
– 0 304 192
but 0 304 192
the 0 304 192
Sacrifice. 0 304 192

So, 0 304 193
the 0 304 193
Victim 0 304 193
of 0 304 193
the 0 304 193
Sacrifice 0 304 193
is 0 304 193
really 0 304 193
present 0 304 193
on 0 304 193
our 0 304 193
altar. 0 304 193

That 0 304 194
is 0 304 194
the 0 304 194
school 0 304 194
of 0 304 194
our 0 304 194
Faith. 0 304 194

And 0 304 195
slowly, 0 304 195
slowly, 0 304 195
this 0 304 195
new 0 304 195
Mass 0 304 195
equivocates. 0 304 195

It 0 304 196
moves 0 304 196
the 0 304 196
minds 0 304 196
of 0 304 196
the 0 304 196
faithful 0 304 196
in 0 304 196
a 0 304 196
Protestant 0 304 196
[direction]. 0 304 196

I 0 304 197
do 0 304 197
not 0 304 197
say 0 304 197
that 0 304 197
all 0 304 197
[Novus 0 304 197
Ordo] 0 304 197
Masses 0 304 197
are 0 304 197
invalid. 0 304 197

I 1 304 198
do 1 304 198
not 1 304 198
say 1 304 198
that. 1 304 198

But 0 304 199
perhaps, 0 304 199
more 0 304 199
and 0 304 199
more, 0 304 199
they 0 304 199
become 0 304 199
invalid 0 304 199
because 0 304 199
[the 0 304 199
ministers 0 304 199
lose 0 304 199
faith 0 304 199
in 0 304 199
the 0 304 199
Real 0 304 199
Presence]. 0 304 199

Recently, 0 304 200
in 0 304 200
France, 0 304 200
a 0 304 200
progressive 0 304 200
paper 0 304 200
conducted 0 304 200
a 0 304 200
statistical 0 304 200
survey 0 304 200
to 0 304 200
see 0 304 200
how 0 304 200
many 0 304 200
priests 0 304 200
no 0 304 200
longer 0 304 200
have 0 304 200
faith 0 304 200
in 0 304 200
the 0 304 200
Real 0 304 200
Presence. 0 304 200

They 0 304 201
found 0 304 201
that 0 304 201
twenty-two 0 304 201
percent 0 304 201
no 0 304 201
longer 0 304 201
have 0 304 201
the 0 304 201
faith, 0 304 201
the 1 304 201
belief 1 304 201
in 0 304 201
the 0 304 201
Real 0 304 201
Presence. 0 304 201

But 0 304 202
I 0 304 202
think 0 304 202
that 0 304 202
if 0 304 202
they 0 304 202
directed 0 304 202
this 0 304 202
question 0 304 202
to 0 304 202
all 0 304 202
of 0 304 202
the 0 304 202
priests 0 304 202
who 0 304 202
are 0 304 202
under 0 304 202
50 0 304 202
years 0 304 202
of 0 304 202
age, 0 304 202
they 0 304 202
would 0 304 202
find 0 304 202
that 0 304 202
fifty 0 304 202
percent 0 304 202
[have 0 304 202
lost 0 304 202
the 0 304 202
faith 0 304 202
in 0 304 202
the 0 304 202
Real 0 304 202
Presence], 0 304 202
because 0 304 202
the 0 304 202
young 0 304 202
priests 0 304 202
have 0 304 202
no 0 304 202
faith. 0 304 202

No 1 304 203
faith. 1 304 203

Last 0 304 204
year, 0 304 204
Bishop 0 304 204
Adam 0 304 204
(in 0 304 204
our 0 304 204
Diocese 0 304 204
of 0 304 204
Sion, 0 304 204
Switzerland) 0 304 204
ordained 0 304 204
one 0 304 204
priest 0 304 204
for 0 304 204
my 0 304 204
Congregation 0 304 204
of 0 304 204
the 0 304 204
Holy 0 304 204
Ghost 0 304 204
Fathers. 0 304 204

This 0 304 205
one 0 304 205
priest 0 304 205
came 0 304 205
from 0 304 205
France. 0 304 205

His 0 304 206
uncle 0 304 206
had 0 304 206
died 0 304 206
in 0 304 206
a 0 304 206
road 0 304 206
accident 0 304 206
when 0 304 206
his 0 304 206
cab 0 304 206
fell 0 304 206
in 0 304 206
the 0 304 206
river. 0 304 206

The 0 304 207
uncle 0 304 207
had 0 304 207
nine 0 304 207
children. 0 304 207

The 0 304 208
Bishop 0 304 208
said 0 304 208
to 0 304 208
the 0 304 208
new 0 304 208
priest, 0 304 208
“Now 0 304 208
you 0 304 208
can 0 304 208
say 0 304 208
Mass 0 304 208
for 0 304 208
your 0 304 208
uncle. 0 304 208

Now 0 304 209
you 0 304 209
are 0 304 209
a 0 304 209
priest, 0 304 209
and 0 304 209
you 0 304 209
can 0 304 209
say 0 304 209
Mass 0 304 209
for 0 304 209
your 0 304 209
uncle.” 0 304 209
The 0 304 209
new 0 304 209
priest 0 304 209
said, 0 304 209
“No, 0 304 209
never.” 0 304 209
Why? 0 304 209

It 0 304 210
is 0 304 210
not 0 304 210
useful 0 304 210
to 0 304 210
say 0 304 210
Mass 0 304 210
for 0 304 210
the 0 304 210
dead? 0 304 210

“No, 0 304 211
no, 0 304 211
it 0 304 211
is 0 304 211
impossible. 0 304 211

They 0 304 212
are 0 304 212
already 0 304 212
in 0 304 212
heaven.” 0 304 212
This 0 304 212
young 0 304 212
priest 0 304 212
who 0 304 212
was 0 304 212
ordained 0 304 212
by 0 304 212
the 0 304 212
Bishop 0 304 212
last 0 304 212
year 0 304 212
for 0 304 212
my 0 304 212
Congregation 0 304 212
is 0 304 212
now 0 304 212
a 0 304 212
professor 0 304 212
in 0 304 212
the 0 304 212
minor 0 304 212
seminary 0 304 212
in 0 304 212
Switzerland. 0 304 212

They 0 304 213
are 0 304 213
not 0 304 213
learning 0 304 213
theology, 0 304 213
not 0 304 213
philosophy, 0 304 213
not 0 304 213
anything. 0 304 213

They 1 304 214
learn 1 304 214
nothing 1 304 214
now. 1 304 214

Another 0 304 215
example. 0 304 215

Recently, 0 304 216
I 0 304 216
had 0 304 216
two 0 304 216
young 0 304 216
[potential] 0 304 216
seminarians 0 304 216
come 0 304 216
to 0 304 216
my 0 304 216
house 0 304 216
near 0 304 216
Paris. 0 304 216

One 0 304 217
of 0 304 217
them 0 304 217
works 0 304 217
in 0 304 217
a 0 304 217
factory, 0 304 217
and 0 304 217
the 0 304 217
other 0 304 217
is 0 304 217
a 0 304 217
university 0 304 217
student. 0 304 217

They 0 304 218
told 0 304 218
me 0 304 218
they 0 304 218
were 0 304 218
[considering] 0 304 218
the 0 304 218
seminary 0 304 218
of 0 304 218
Paris. 0 304 218

I 0 304 219
asked 0 304 219
them, 0 304 219
“Why 0 304 219
do 0 304 219
you 0 304 219
come 0 304 219
to 0 304 219
see 0 304 219
me?” 0 304 219
They 0 304 219
told 0 304 219
me 0 304 219
that 0 304 219
they 0 304 219
had 0 304 219
a 0 304 219
meeting 0 304 219
in 0 304 219
the 0 304 219
house 0 304 219
of 0 304 219
the 0 304 219
Oblate 0 304 219
of 0 304 219
Maria 0 304 219
with 0 304 219
the 0 304 219
priest 0 304 219
who 0 304 219
oversees 0 304 219
young 0 304 219
men 0 304 219
who 0 304 219
may 0 304 219
have 0 304 219
vocations 0 304 219
to 0 304 219
the 0 304 219
priesthood 0 304 219
in 0 304 219
the 0 304 219
Diocese 0 304 219
of 0 304 219
Paris. 0 304 219

There 0 304 220
was 0 304 220
a 0 304 220
total 0 304 220
of 0 304 220
fifteen 0 304 220
young 0 304 220
men 0 304 220
for 0 304 220
all 0 304 220
of 0 304 220
the 0 304 220
Diocese 0 304 220
of 0 304 220
Paris. 0 304 220

During 0 304 221
the 0 304 221
meeting, 0 304 221
the 0 304 221
priest, 0 304 221
before 0 304 221
he 0 304 221
celebrated 0 304 221
the 0 304 221
Eucharist, 0 304 221
said, 0 304 221
“Today 0 304 221
we 0 304 221
celebrate 0 304 221
the 0 304 221
Eucharist, 0 304 221
but 0 304 221
we 0 304 221
do 0 304 221
not 0 304 221
believe 0 304 221
in 0 304 221
the 0 304 221
Real 0 304 221
Presence.” 0 304 221
These 0 304 221
two 0 304 221
young 0 304 221
men 0 304 221
said 0 304 221
“That 0 304 221
is 0 304 221
impossible. 1 304 221

We 0 304 222
cannot 0 304 222
remain 0 304 222
in 0 304 222
this 0 304 222
seminary.” 0 304 222
So, 0 304 222
they 0 304 222
came 0 304 222
to 0 304 222
meet 0 304 222
me. 0 304 222

They 0 304 223
said 0 304 223
that 0 304 223
Econe 0 304 223
is 0 304 223
the 0 304 223
only 0 304 223
seminary 0 304 223
where 0 304 223
they 0 304 223
seem 0 304 223
to 0 304 223
be 0 304 223
able 0 304 223
to 0 304 223
find 0 304 223
the 0 304 223
True 0 304 223
Faith. 0 304 223

They 0 304 224
asked 0 304 224
for 0 304 224
admittance 0 304 224
to 0 304 224
Econe. 0 304 224

And 0 304 225
I 0 304 225
think 0 304 225
that 0 304 225
they 0 304 225
shall 0 304 225
be 0 304 225
coming 0 304 225
to 0 304 225
Econe 0 304 225
next 0 304 225
October. 0 304 225

But 0 304 226
that 0 304 226
is 0 304 226
a 0 304 226
new 0 304 226
religion. 0 304 226

It 0 304 227
is 0 304 227
a 0 304 227
Protestant 0 304 227
religion. 0 304 227

That 1 304 228
is 1 304 228
a 1 304 228
fact. 1 304 228

Perhaps 0 304 229
you 0 304 229
can 0 304 229
say, 0 304 229
“How 1 304 229
is 1 304 229
it 1 304 229
possible 1 304 229
that 1 304 229
the 1 304 229
pope 1 304 229
gives 1 304 229
the 1 304 229
authorization 1 304 229
to 1 304 229
this 1 304 229
change? 1 304 229

How 1 304 230
is 1 304 230
it 1 304 230
possible 1 304 230
the 1 304 230
pope 1 304 230
signed 1 304 230
this 1 304 230
decree? 1 304 230

Signed 1 304 231
this 1 304 231
constitution?” 1 304 231
I 0 304 231
don’t 0 304 231
know. 0 304 231

I 1 304 232
don’t 1 304 232
know. 1 304 232

It 0 304 233
is 0 304 233
a 0 304 233
big 0 304 233
mystery. 0 304 233

A 1 304 234
big 1 304 234
mystery. 1 304 234

There 0 304 235
are 0 304 235
many 0 304 235
proposed 0 304 235
theological 0 304 235
answers. 0 304 235

I 0 304 236
cannot 0 304 236
subscribe 0 304 236
to 0 304 236
all 0 304 236
of 0 304 236
them. 0 304 236

Some 0 304 237
say 0 304 237
the 0 304 237
pope 0 304 237
is 0 304 237
not 0 304 237
responsible. 0 304 237

Perhaps 0 304 238
someone 0 304 238
gave 0 304 238
the 0 304 238
pope 0 304 238
an 0 304 238
injection, 0 304 238
a 0 304 238
drug, 0 304 238
and 0 304 238
he 0 304 238
is 0 304 238
not 0 304 238
responsible. 0 304 238

Perhaps, 0 304 239
I 0 304 239
don’t 0 304 239
know. 0 304 239

Some 0 304 240
say 0 304 240
there 0 304 240
are 0 304 240
two 0 304 240
popes 0 304 240
[(a 0 304 240
body 0 304 240
double)]. 0 304 240

I 1 304 241
don’t 1 304 241
know. 1 304 241

Some 0 304 242
say 0 304 242
the 0 304 242
pope 0 304 242
was 0 304 242
liberal 0 304 242
before 0 304 242
he 0 304 242
was 0 304 242
elected 0 304 242
pope, 0 304 242
and 0 304 242
perhaps 0 304 242
(we 0 304 242
do 0 304 242
not 0 304 242
know) 0 304 242
he 0 304 242
gave 0 304 242
his 0 304 242
name 0 304 242
to 0 304 242
Freemasonry 0 304 242
(thereby 0 304 242
incurring 0 304 242
excommunication 0 304 242
before 0 304 242
the 0 304 242
conclave). 0 304 242

We 0 304 243
do 0 304 243
not 0 304 243
know. 0 304 243

We 0 304 244
do 0 304 244
know 0 304 244
now 0 304 244
that 0 304 244
Bugnini 0 304 244
was 0 304 244
primarily 0 304 244
responsible 0 304 244
for 0 304 244
the 0 304 244
change 0 304 244
in 0 304 244
liturgy, 0 304 244
and 0 304 244
that 0 304 244
he 1 304 244
is 1 304 244
an 1 304 244
infamous 1 304 244
Freemason. 1 304 244

And 0 304 245
because 0 304 245
he 0 304 245
had 0 304 245
an 0 304 245
indiscretion 0 304 245
with 0 304 245
his 0 304 245
Masonic 0 304 245
appurtenances, 0 304 245
the 0 304 245
Pope 0 304 245
sent 0 304 245
him 0 304 245
as 0 304 245
a 0 304 245
Nuncio 0 304 245
in 0 304 245
Iran. 0 304 245

I 1 304 246
don’t 1 304 246
know. 1 304 246

We 1 304 247
don’t 1 304 247
know. 1 304 247

Now, 0 304 248
you 0 304 248
cannot 0 304 248
say 0 304 248
that 0 304 248
Archbishop 0 304 248
Lefebvre 0 304 248
said 0 304 248
the 0 304 248
pope 0 304 248
gave 0 304 248
his 0 304 248
name 0 304 248
to 0 304 248
Freemasonry. 0 304 248

No, 0 304 249
you 0 304 249
cannot 0 304 249
say 0 304 249
that. 0 304 249

It 0 304 250
is 0 304 250
possible, 0 304 250
but 0 304 250
we 1 304 250
do 1 304 250
not 1 304 250
know. 1 304 250

But 0 304 251
if 0 304 251
he 0 304 251
was 0 304 251
excommunicated, 0 304 251
then 0 304 251
he 0 304 251
is 0 304 251
not 0 304 251
pope. 0 304 251

Not 1 304 252
pope. 1 304 252

Illegitimate. 0 304 253

I 0 304 254
don’t 0 304 254
know. 0 304 254

It 0 304 255
is 0 304 255
a 0 304 255
mystery 0 304 255
I 0 304 255
cannot 0 304 255
understand. 0 304 255

But 0 304 256
the 0 304 256
fact 0 304 256
is 0 304 256
that 0 304 256
the 0 304 256
Catholic 0 304 256
Church 0 304 256
is 0 304 256
being 0 304 256
destroyed, 0 304 256
and 0 304 256
now 0 304 256
even 0 304 256
the 0 304 256
pope 0 304 256
himself 0 304 256
says 0 304 256
that. 0 304 256

This 0 304 257
pope 0 304 257
has 0 304 257
referred 0 304 257
to 0 304 257
the 0 304 257
auto-demolition 0 304 257
of 0 304 257
the 0 304 257
Church. 0 304 257

He 0 304 258
said, 0 304 258
“The 0 304 258
smoke 1 304 258
of 1 304 258
Satan 1 304 258
has 0 304 258
entered 0 304 258
the 0 304 258
Church.” 0 304 258
But 0 304 258
where 0 304 258
are 0 304 258
the 0 304 258
men 0 304 258
responsible 0 304 258
for 0 304 258
the 0 304 258
destruction 0 304 258
of 0 304 258
the 0 304 258
Church? 0 304 258

Well, 0 304 259
there 0 304 259
they 0 304 259
are. 0 304 259

They 0 304 260
are 0 304 260
the 0 304 260
men 0 304 260
who 0 304 260
destroy 0 304 260
the 0 304 260
Church. 0 304 260

We 0 304 261
must 0 304 261
show 0 304 261
where 0 304 261
they 0 304 261
are. 0 304 261

Where 0 304 262
is 0 304 262
this 0 304 262
smoke 1 304 262
of 1 304 262
Satan 1 304 262
that 0 304 262
has 0 304 262
entered 0 304 262
the 0 304 262
Church? 0 304 262

I 0 304 263
do 0 304 263
not 0 304 263
know, 0 304 263
but 0 304 263
it 0 304 263
is 0 304 263
the 0 304 263
pope 0 304 263
himself 0 304 263
who 0 304 263
said 0 304 263
that. 0 304 263

And 0 304 264
I 0 304 264
have 0 304 264
these 0 304 264
experiences 0 304 264
every 0 304 264
day. 0 304 264

I 0 304 265
visit 0 304 265
many 0 304 265
countries. 0 304 265

I 0 304 266
was 0 304 266
in 0 304 266
Spain 0 304 266
during 0 304 266
the 0 304 266
Christmas 0 304 266
Holy 0 304 266
Days. 0 304 266

Then 0 304 267
I 0 304 267
was 0 304 267
in 0 304 267
Bonn, 0 304 267
near 0 304 267
Cologne, 0 304 267
Germany, 0 304 267
three 0 304 267
weeks 0 304 267
ago, 0 304 267
to 0 304 267
speak 0 304 267
at 0 304 267
a 0 304 267
conference. 0 304 267

Many 0 304 268
people 0 304 268
came. 0 304 268

Many 0 304 269
people 0 304 269
are 0 304 269
confused. 0 304 269

What 0 304 270
is 0 304 270
happening 0 304 270
in 0 304 270
the 0 304 270
Church? 0 304 270

They 0 304 271
are 0 304 271
anxious. 0 304 271

But 0 304 272
many 0 304 272
people 0 304 272
say 0 304 272
that 0 304 272
we 0 304 272
disobey. 0 304 272

Disobey? 0 304 273

Obedience 0 304 274
is 0 304 274
relative. 0 304 274

It 0 304 275
is 0 304 275
not 0 304 275
absolute. 0 304 275

It 0 304 276
is 0 304 276
relative 0 304 276
to 0 304 276
the 0 304 276
good, 0 304 276
but 0 304 276
not 0 304 276
to 0 304 276
the 0 304 276
evil. 0 304 276

We 0 304 277
cannot 0 304 277
obey 0 304 277
our 0 304 277
parents 0 304 277
if 0 304 277
they 0 304 277
command 0 304 277
a 0 304 277
bad 0 304 277
thing. 0 304 277

We 0 304 278
cannot 0 304 278
obey. 0 304 278

It 0 304 279
is 0 304 279
clear. 0 304 279

And 0 304 280
I 0 304 280
know 0 304 280
that 0 304 280
in 0 304 280
Spain, 0 304 280
for 0 304 280
example, 0 304 280
the 0 304 280
situation 0 304 280
in 0 304 280
the 0 304 280
Church 0 304 280
is 0 304 280
very 0 304 280
bad. 0 304 280

The 0 304 281
new 0 304 281
nominees 0 304 281
of 0 304 281
bishops 0 304 281
and 0 304 281
many 0 304 281
auxiliary 0 304 281
bishops 0 304 281
are, 0 304 281
approximately, 0 304 281
communist, 0 304 281
Marxist, 0 304 281
and 0 304 281
socialist. 0 304 281

And 0 304 282
so, 0 304 282
a 0 304 282
majority 0 304 282
of 0 304 282
the 0 304 282
bishops 0 304 282
in 0 304 282
the 0 304 282
Episcopal 0 304 282
Conference 0 304 282
of 0 304 282
Spain 0 304 282
are 0 304 282
progressives. 0 304 282

They 0 304 283
are 0 304 283
modernists. 0 304 283

Whereas, 0 304 284
the 0 304 284
majority 0 304 284
of 0 304 284
the 0 304 284
bishops 0 304 284
[from 0 304 284
Spain] 0 304 284
during 0 304 284
the 0 304 284
Council 0 304 284
were 0 304 284
conservative. 0 304 284

So, 0 304 285
Rome 0 304 285
is 0 304 285
responsible 0 304 285
[for 0 304 285
the 0 304 285
situation 0 304 285
of 0 304 285
the 0 304 285
Church 0 304 285
in 0 304 285
Spain] 0 304 285
because 0 304 285
it 0 304 285
is 0 304 285
Rome 0 304 285
who 0 304 285
approves 0 304 285
the 0 304 285
nominations 0 304 285
for 0 304 285
bishops. 0 304 285

And 0 304 286
we 0 304 286
know 0 304 286
in 0 304 286
France, 0 304 286
in 0 304 286
Germany, 0 304 286
and 0 304 286
in 0 304 286
Europe 0 304 286
generally, 0 304 286
that 0 304 286
all 0 304 286
of 0 304 286
the 0 304 286
young 0 304 286
bishops 0 304 286
are 0 304 286
worse 0 304 286
[than 0 304 286
the 0 304 286
bishops 0 304 286
in 0 304 286
Spain] 0 304 286
in 0 304 286
that 0 304 286
they 0 304 286
are 0 304 286
more 0 304 286
or 0 304 286
less 0 304 286
Marxist. 0 304 286

That 0 304 287
is 0 304 287
a 0 304 287
fact. 0 304 287

That 0 304 288
is 0 304 288
impossible. 0 304 288

How 0 304 289
can 0 304 289
they 0 304 289
do 0 304 289
that? 0 304 289

I 0 304 290
do 0 304 290
not 0 304 290
know. 0 304 290

I 1 304 291
do 1 304 291
not 1 304 291
know. 1 304 291

I 0 304 292
have 0 304 292
not 0 304 292
spent 0 304 292
my 0 304 292
whole 0 304 292
life 0 304 292
in 0 304 292
Rome. 0 304 292

I 0 304 293
do 0 304 293
know 0 304 293
Rome 0 304 293
very 0 304 293
well, 0 304 293
because 0 304 293
I 0 304 293
was 0 304 293
an 0 304 293
apostolic 0 304 293
delegate, 0 304 293
and 0 304 293
I 0 304 293
was 0 304 293
in 0 304 293
the 0 304 293
Secretariate 0 304 293
of 0 304 293
the 0 304 293
Secretary 0 304 293
of 0 304 293
State. 0 304 293

And 0 304 294
I 0 304 294
know 0 304 294
that 0 304 294
very 0 304 294
well. 0 304 294

But 0 304 295
I 0 304 295
think 0 304 295
that 0 304 295
the 1 304 295
devil 1 304 295
is 1 304 295
in 1 304 295
Rome, 1 304 295
as 0 304 295
was 0 304 295
said 0 304 295
by 0 304 295
our 0 304 295
Lady 0 304 295
of 0 304 295
Fatima 0 304 295
and 0 304 295
Our 0 304 295
Lady 0 304 295
of 0 304 295
La 0 304 295
Salette. 0 304 295

We 0 304 296
must 0 304 296
pray. 0 304 296

We 0 304 297
must 0 304 297
ask 0 304 297
God 0 304 297
to 0 304 297
put 0 304 297
an 0 304 297
end 0 304 297
to 0 304 297
this 0 304 297
crisis 0 304 297
of 0 304 297
the 0 304 297
Church. 0 304 297

Because 1 304 298
if 1 304 298
this 1 304 298
crisis 1 304 298
continues, 1 304 298
many 1 304 298
people 1 304 298
will 1 304 298
go 1 304 298
to 1 304 298
hell. 1 304 298

They 0 304 299
lose 0 304 299
the 0 304 299
faith. 0 304 299

They 0 304 300
cannot 0 304 300
go 0 304 300
into 0 304 300
the 0 304 300
church. 0 304 300

They 0 304 301
abandon 0 304 301
the 0 304 301
faith. 0 304 301

You 0 304 302
know 0 304 302
that 0 304 302
many 0 304 302
priests 0 304 302
have 0 304 302
abandoned 0 304 302
the 0 304 302
faith. 0 304 302

Many 0 304 303
priests 0 304 303
have 0 304 303
gotten 0 304 303
married. 0 304 303

And 0 304 304
many 0 304 304
sisters 0 304 304
have 0 304 304
abandoned 0 304 304
their 0 304 304
congregations. 0 304 304

It 0 304 305
is 0 304 305
a 0 304 305
pity. 0 304 305

And 0 304 306
it 0 304 306
is 0 304 306
everywhere. 0 304 306

I 0 304 307
was 0 304 307
in 0 304 307
Melbourne, 0 304 307
Australia, 0 304 307
during 0 304 307
the 0 304 307
40th 0 304 307
International 0 304 307
Eucharistic 0 304 307

Cardinal 0 304 308
Knox, 0 304 308
who 0 304 308
was 0 304 308
the 0 304 308
man 0 304 308
responsible 0 304 308
for 0 304 308
the 0 304 308
Eucharistic 0 304 308
Congress, 0 304 308
is 0 304 308
now 0 304 308
the 0 304 308
Prefect 0 304 308
of 0 304 308
the 0 304 308
Congregation 0 304 308
for 0 304 308
Divine 0 304 308
Worship. 0 304 308

I 0 304 309
read 0 304 309
in 0 304 309
the 0 304 309
newspaper 0 304 309
about 0 304 309
a 0 304 309
Mass 0 304 309
Cardinal 0 304 309
Knox 0 304 309
celebrated 0 304 309
during 0 304 309
the 0 304 309
Eucharistic 0 304 309
Congress 0 304 309
where 0 304 309
sensual 1 304 309
dancing 1 304 309
was 0 304 309
performed 0 304 309
at 0 304 309
the 0 304 309
same 0 304 309
time 0 304 309
the 0 304 309
words 0 304 309
of 0 304 309
the 0 304 309
Consecration 0 304 309
were 0 304 309
pronounced. 0 304 309

That 0 304 310
is 0 304 310
a 0 304 310
sacrilege. 1 304 310

You 0 304 311
cannot 0 304 311
go 0 304 311
to 0 304 311
that 0 304 311
Mass. 0 304 311

That 1 304 312
is 1 304 312
sacrilege. 1 304 312

This 0 304 313
is 0 304 313
a 0 304 313
fact. 0 304 313

They 0 304 314
also 0 304 314
called 0 304 314
me 0 304 314
by 0 304 314
phone 0 304 314
in 0 304 314
Melbourne 0 304 314
to 0 304 314
say 0 304 314
I 0 304 314
was 0 304 314
on 0 304 314
the 0 304 314
list 0 304 314
of 0 304 314
the 0 304 314
bishops 0 304 314
[attending] 0 304 314
the 0 304 314
Eucharistic 0 304 314
Congress. 0 304 314

They 0 304 315
asked 0 304 315
me 0 304 315
to 0 304 315
concelebrate 0 304 315
Mass 0 304 315
with 0 304 315
a 0 304 315
Protestant 0 304 315
pastor 0 304 315
and 0 304 315
a 0 304 315
rabbi. 0 304 315

Ay. 1 304 316

Impossible. 1 304 317

Impossible. 1 304 318

No, 1 304 319
no, 1 304 319
no, 1 304 319
no. 1 304 319

[applause] 0 304 320

This 0 304 321
change 0 304 321
is 0 304 321
not 0 304 321
accidental. 0 304 321

It 0 304 322
is 0 304 322
not 0 304 322
superficial. 0 304 322

It 0 304 323
is 0 304 323
very 0 304 323
deep. 0 304 323

Very 0 304 324
bad. 0 304 324

It 0 304 325
is 0 304 325
against 0 304 325
our 0 304 325
faith. 0 304 325

Against 1 304 326
our 1 304 326
faith. 1 304 326

And 0 304 327
so, 0 304 327
we 0 304 327
cannot 0 304 327
accept 0 304 327
this 0 304 327
Council 0 304 327
and 0 304 327
this 0 304 327
reform 0 304 327
and 0 304 327
this 0 304 327
orientation 0 304 327
even 0 304 327
though 0 304 327
it 0 304 327
comes 0 304 327
from 0 304 327
Rome. 0 304 327

From 0 304 328
Rome 0 304 328
we 0 304 328
expect 0 304 328
only 0 304 328
the 0 304 328
good. 0 304 328

We 0 304 329
do 0 304 329
not 0 304 329
expect 0 304 329
the 0 304 329
bad, 0 304 329
the 0 304 329
ill. 0 304 329
We 0 304 329
do 0 304 329
not 0 304 329
expect 0 304 329
the 0 304 329
abandonment 0 304 329
of 0 304 329
adoration 0 304 329
in 0 304 329
the 0 304 329
Mass. 0 304 329

We 0 304 330
need 0 304 330
this 0 304 330
adoration. 0 304 330

We 0 304 331
need 0 304 331
to 0 304 331
have 0 304 331
the 0 304 331
faith 0 304 331
in 0 304 331
the 0 304 331
divinity 0 304 331
of 0 304 331
Jesus 0 304 331
Christ. 0 304 331

Because 0 304 332
all 0 304 332
[of 0 304 332
this 0 304 332
change] 0 304 332
is 0 304 332
[oriented] 0 304 332
against 0 304 332
the 0 304 332
divinity 0 304 332
of 0 304 332
Jesus 0 304 332
Christ, 0 304 332
against 0 304 332
the 0 304 332
Kingdom 0 304 332
of 0 304 332
Jesus 0 304 332
Christ, 0 304 332
against 0 304 332
the 0 304 332
Real 0 304 332
Presence 0 304 332
of 0 304 332
Jesus 0 304 332
Christ 0 304 332
in 0 304 332
the 0 304 332
Mass. 0 304 332

It 0 304 333
is 0 304 333
a 0 304 333
sin 0 304 333
when 0 304 333
we 0 304 333
abandon 0 304 333
the 0 304 333
truth 0 304 333
of 0 304 333
the 0 304 333
Kingdom 0 304 333
of 0 304 333
Jesus 0 304 333
Christ, 0 304 333
everywhere, 0 304 333
and 0 304 333
we 0 304 333
abandon 0 304 333
the 0 304 333
Faith 0 304 333
of 0 304 333
the 0 304 333
divinity 0 304 333
of 0 304 333
Jesus 0 304 333
Christ. 0 304 333

He 0 304 334
is 0 304 334
King 0 304 334
because 0 304 334
he 0 304 334
is 0 304 334
God. 0 304 334

He 0 304 335
is 0 304 335
the 0 304 335
Son 0 304 335
of 0 304 335
God. 0 304 335

So, 0 304 336
He 0 304 336
is 0 304 336
King 0 304 336
by 0 304 336
His 0 304 336
nature. 0 304 336

This 0 304 337
is 0 304 337
essential. 0 304 337

Essential! 1 304 338

And 1 304 339
if 1 304 339
He 1 304 339
is 1 304 339
God, 1 304 339
we 1 304 339
must 1 304 339
give 1 304 339
Him 1 304 339
the 1 304 339
adoration 1 304 339
of 1 304 339
God. 1 304 339

And 0 304 340
so, 0 304 340
we 0 304 340
cannot 0 304 340
accept 0 304 340
the 0 304 340
diminution 0 304 340
of 0 304 340
this 0 304 340
Truth. 0 304 340

Jesus 0 304 341
Christ 0 304 341
is 0 304 341
the 0 304 341
Son 0 304 341
of 0 304 341
God. 0 304 341

Jesus 0 304 342
Christ 0 304 342
is 0 304 342
God. 0 304 342

That 0 304 343
is 0 304 343
a 0 304 343
fundamental 0 304 343
truth 0 304 343
of 0 304 343
our 0 304 343
Faith. 0 304 343

And 0 304 344
it 0 304 344
all 0 304 344
depends 0 304 344
on 0 304 344
this 0 304 344
Truth. 0 304 344

And 0 304 345
we 0 304 345
know 0 304 345
now 0 304 345
that 0 304 345
the 0 304 345
theologians 0 304 345
and 0 304 345
the 0 304 345
bishops 0 304 345
have 0 304 345
[a 0 304 345
new 0 304 345
orientation]. 0 304 345

They 0 304 346
do 0 304 346
not 0 304 346
express 0 304 346
this 0 304 346
truth 0 304 346
clearly 0 304 346
and 0 304 346
perfectly. 0 304 346

They 0 304 347
are 0 304 347
afraid 0 304 347
of 0 304 347
the 0 304 347
truth. 0 304 347

That 0 304 348
is 0 304 348
very 0 304 348
bad. 0 304 348

And 0 304 349
it 0 304 349
is 0 304 349
the 0 304 349
same 0 304 349
in 0 304 349
Rome. 0 304 349

I 0 304 350
think 0 304 350
they 0 304 350
refuse 0 304 350
[to 0 304 350
grant 0 304 350
me 0 304 350
an 0 304 350
audience 0 304 350
with] 0 304 350
the 0 304 350
pope, 0 304 350
[because 0 304 350
they 0 304 350
are 0 304 350
afraid 0 304 350
of 0 304 350
the 0 304 350
Truth]. 0 304 350

When 0 304 351
I 0 304 351
was 0 304 351
in 0 304 351
Rome 0 304 351
one 0 304 351
month 0 304 351
ago, 0 304 351
Mgr. 0 304 351

Benelli 0 304 352
told 0 304 352
me 0 304 352
he 0 304 352
visits 0 304 352
the 0 304 352
pope 0 304 352
every 0 304 352
day. 0 304 352

He 0 304 353
said 0 304 353
that 0 304 353
when 0 304 353
he 0 304 353
left 0 304 353
me, 0 304 353
he 0 304 353
would 0 304 353
go 0 304 353
immediately 0 304 353
to 0 304 353
the 0 304 353
pope 0 304 353
to 0 304 353
express 0 304 353
the 0 304 353
importance 0 304 353
of 0 304 353
the 0 304 353
work 0 304 353
we 0 304 353
had 0 304 353
conducted 0 304 353
during 0 304 353
our 0 304 353
meeting. 0 304 353

Immediately, 0 304 354
he 0 304 354
said, 0 304 354
he 0 304 354
would 0 304 354
be 0 304 354
going. 0 304 354

So, 0 304 355
why 0 304 355
do 0 304 355
they 0 304 355
not 0 304 355
grant 0 304 355
me 0 304 355
the 0 304 355
possibility 0 304 355
of 0 304 355
visiting 0 304 355
the 0 304 355
pope? 0 304 355

Because 0 304 356
they 0 304 356
are 0 304 356
afraid. 0 304 356

Meanwhile 0 304 357
the 0 304 357
Vatican 0 304 357
operated 0 304 357
a 0 304 357
veritable 0 304 357
swinging 0 304 357
door 0 304 357
where 0 304 357
actual 0 304 357
heretics 0 304 357
and 0 304 357
schismatics 0 304 357
were 0 304 357
concerned. 0 304 357

Here, 0 304 358
again, 0 304 358
is 0 304 358
Blessed 0 304 358
Paul 0 304 358
VI, 0 304 358
famously 0 304 358
meeting 0 304 358
for 0 304 358
the 0 304 358
first 0 304 358
time 0 304 358
ever 0 304 358
with 0 304 358
the 0 304 358
heretic 0 304 358
Archbishop 0 304 358
of 0 304 358
Canterbury 0 304 358
in 0 304 358
St. 0 304 358
Peter's: 0 304 358

Cardinal 0 304 359
Villot 0 304 359
said, 0 304 359
“We 0 304 359
are 0 304 359
afraid 0 304 359
if 0 304 359
Msgr. 0 304 359

Lefebvre 0 304 360
meets 0 304 360
and 0 304 360
speaks 0 304 360
with 0 304 360
the 0 304 360
pope 0 304 360
that 0 304 360
perhaps 0 304 360
the 0 304 360
pope 0 304 360
will 0 304 360
change 0 304 360
his 0 304 360
mind.” 0 304 360
Because 0 304 360
[the 0 304 360
pope] 0 304 360
is 0 304 360
not 0 304 360
too 0 304 360
sure; 0 304 360
the 1 304 360
pope 1 304 360
is 1 304 360
not 1 304 360
man 1 304 360
of 1 304 360
true 1 304 360
conviction. 1 304 360

He 0 304 361
is 0 304 361
a 0 304 361
mysterious 0 304 361
man. 0 304 361

We 0 304 362
cannot 0 304 362
give 0 304 362
a 0 304 362
definition 0 304 362
of 0 304 362
the 0 304 362
man. 0 304 362

He 0 304 363
expresses 0 304 363
the 0 304 363
truth, 0 304 363
and 0 304 363
then 0 304 363
he 0 304 363
does 0 304 363
the 0 304 363
contrary/opposite. 0 304 363

Some 0 304 364
part 0 304 364
of 0 304 364
him 0 304 364
will 0 304 364
speak 0 304 364
the 0 304 364
truth. 0 304 364

Another 0 304 365
part 0 304 365
of 0 304 365
him 0 304 365
is 0 304 365
open 0 304 365
to 0 304 365
error. 0 304 365

Very 0 304 366
curious. 0 304 366

And 0 304 367
they 0 304 367
are 0 304 367
afraid 0 304 367
that 0 304 367
if 0 304 367
I 0 304 367
reveal 0 304 367
the 0 304 367
truth 0 304 367
[and 0 304 367
tell 0 304 367
the 0 304 367
Pope] 0 304 367
“you 0 304 367
must 0 304 367
affirm 0 304 367
the 0 304 367
Kingdom 0 304 367
of 0 304 367
Jesus 0 304 367
Christ 0 304 367
everywhere 0 304 367
and 0 304 367
always 0 304 367
each 0 304 367
day. 0 304 367

You 0 304 368
must 0 304 368
affirm 0 304 368
the 0 304 368
Real 0 304 368
Presence 0 304 368
in 0 304 368
the 0 304 368
Mass 0 304 368
- 0 304 368
in 0 304 368
the 0 304 368
Sacrifice 0 304 368
of 0 304 368
the 0 304 368
Mass,” 0 304 368
then 0 304 368
perhaps 0 304 368
it 0 304 368
is 0 304 368
possible 0 304 368
that 0 304 368
the 0 304 368
Pope 0 304 368
will 0 304 368
change 0 304 368
his 0 304 368
mind. 0 304 368

And 0 304 369
so, 0 304 369
Cardinal 0 304 369
Villot 0 304 369
says, 0 304 369
there 0 304 369
is 0 304 369
a 0 304 369
confusion, 0 304 369
and 0 304 369
they 0 304 369
do 0 304 369
not 0 304 369
want 0 304 369
me 0 304 369
to 0 304 369
visit 0 304 369
the 0 304 369
pope. 0 304 369

It 0 304 370
is 0 304 370
impossible 0 304 370
to 0 304 370
admit 0 304 370
me. 0 304 370

And 0 304 371
I 0 304 371
know 0 304 371
the 0 304 371
pope 0 304 371
very 0 304 371
well! 0 304 371

When 0 304 372
I 0 304 372
was 0 304 372
the 0 304 372
apostolic 0 304 372
delegate 0 304 372
to 0 304 372
Pius 0 304 372
XII, 0 304 372
I 0 304 372
was 0 304 372
going 0 304 372
to 0 304 372
Rome 0 304 372
every 0 304 372
year. 0 304 372

And 0 304 373
during 0 304 373
those 0 304 373
eleven 0 304 373
years, 0 304 373
I 0 304 373
met 0 304 373
Msgr. 0 304 373

Montini. 0 304 374

I 1 304 375
know 1 304 375
him 1 304 375
very 1 304 375
well. 1 304 375

He 0 304 376
received 0 304 376
me 0 304 376
twice 0 304 376
during 0 304 376
the 0 304 376
Council, 0 304 376
for 0 304 376
a 0 304 376
private 0 304 376
audience 0 304 376
with 0 304 376
the 0 304 376
pope. 0 304 376

But, 0 304 377
now, 0 304 377
with 0 304 377
my 0 304 377
position 0 304 377
against 0 304 377
the 0 304 377
Council 0 304 377
and 0 304 377
the 0 304 377
reforms, 0 304 377
he 0 304 377
says: 0 304 377
“No, 0 304 377
impossible! 0 304 377

You 0 304 378
must 0 304 378
sign 0 304 378
in 0 304 378
writing 0 304 378
that 0 304 378
you 0 304 378
[accept] 0 304 378
the 0 304 378
Council 0 304 378
and 0 304 378
all 0 304 378
the 0 304 378
reforms 0 304 378
before 0 304 378
I 0 304 378
will 0 304 378
receive 0 304 378
you 0 304 378
in 0 304 378
audience.” 0 304 378
But 0 304 378
I 0 304 378
cannot 0 304 378
do 0 304 378
that. 0 304 378

For 0 304 379
me, 0 304 379
if 1 304 379
I 1 304 379
do 1 304 379
that, 1 304 379
then 1 304 379
I 1 304 379
betray 1 304 379
my 1 304 379
mother, 1 304 379
the 1 304 379
Church. 1 304 379

The 1 304 380
Church! 1 304 380

So, 0 304 381
I 0 304 381
thank 0 304 381
you 0 304 381
very 0 304 381
much 0 304 381
for 0 304 381
your 0 304 381
encouragement, 0 304 381
and 0 304 381
I 0 304 381
must 0 304 381
say 0 304 381
that 0 304 381
we 0 304 381
have 0 304 381
a 0 304 381
very 0 304 381
good 0 304 381
generation 0 304 381
of 0 304 381
young 0 304 381
men 0 304 381
and 0 304 381
good 0 304 381
vocations. 0 304 381

For 0 304 382
the 0 304 382
coming 0 304 382
year 0 304 382
we 0 304 382
have 0 304 382
59 0 304 382
applications 0 304 382
to 0 304 382
our 0 304 382
seminary 0 304 382
in 0 304 382
Econe, 0 304 382
Switzerland 0 304 382
– 0 304 382
applications 0 304 382
from 0 304 382
the 0 304 382
United 0 304 382
States, 0 304 382
from 0 304 382
England, 0 304 382
from 0 304 382
Germany, 0 304 382
from 0 304 382
France, 0 304 382
and 0 304 382
Spain. 0 304 382

Good 0 304 383
young 0 304 383
men 0 304 383
with 0 304 383
good 0 304 383
dispositions 0 304 383
are 0 304 383
coming 0 304 383
from 0 304 383
everywhere. 0 304 383

And 0 304 384
why? 0 304 384

Why 0 304 385
do 0 304 385
they 0 304 385
come 0 304 385
to 0 304 385
this 0 304 385
seminary 0 304 385
when 0 304 385
they 0 304 385
know 0 304 385
we 0 304 385
are 0 304 385
in 0 304 385
difficulties 0 304 385
with 0 304 385
Rome? 0 304 385

They 0 304 386
know 0 304 386
that. 0 304 386

But 0 304 387
still 0 304 387
they 0 304 387
come. 0 304 387

I 0 304 388
ask 0 304 388
them, 0 304 388
why 0 304 388
do 0 304 388
you 0 304 388
come 0 304 388
to 0 304 388
Econe? 0 304 388

You 0 304 389
know 0 304 389
our 0 304 389
situation. 0 304 389

They 0 304 390
say, 0 304 390
“Yes, 0 304 390
we 0 304 390
know 0 304 390
your 0 304 390
situation, 0 304 390
but 0 304 390
we 0 304 390
want 0 304 390
to 0 304 390
become 0 304 390
true 0 304 390
priests 0 304 390
and 0 304 390
not 0 304 390
protestant 0 304 390
pastors 0 304 390
or 0 304 390
modernist 0 304 390
priests. 0 304 390

We 0 304 391
are 0 304 391
coming 0 304 391
to 0 304 391
your 0 304 391
seminary 0 304 391
because 0 304 391
we 0 304 391
know 0 304 391
that 0 304 391
the 0 304 391
end 0 304 391
of 0 304 391
the 0 304 391
priest 0 304 391
is 0 304 391
to 0 304 391
offer 0 304 391
the 0 304 391
true 0 304 391
Sacrifice 0 304 391
of 0 304 391
the 0 304 391
Mass. 0 304 391

And 0 304 392
so, 0 304 392
we 0 304 392
are 0 304 392
Coming 0 304 392
to 0 304 392
Econe.” 0 304 392

And 0 304 393
as 0 304 393
I 0 304 393
have 0 304 393
visited 0 304 393
my 0 304 393
seminary 0 304 393
here 0 304 393
in 0 304 393
Armada 0 304 393
for 0 304 393
the 0 304 393
past 0 304 393
five 0 304 393
days, 0 304 393
I 0 304 393
can 0 304 393
see 0 304 393
it 0 304 393
is 0 304 393
the 0 304 393
same 0 304 393
here. 0 304 393

We 0 304 394
have 0 304 394
very 0 304 394
good 0 304 394
young 0 304 394
men. 0 304 394

I 0 304 395
also 0 304 395
have 0 304 395
some 0 304 395
Americans 0 304 395
in 0 304 395
my 0 304 395
seminary 0 304 395
in 0 304 395
Econe. 0 304 395

In 0 304 396
six 0 304 396
weeks 0 304 396
I 0 304 396
will 0 304 396
ordain 0 304 396
one 0 304 396
American 0 304 396
priest 0 304 396
from 0 304 396
Detroit, 0 304 396
who 0 304 396
is 0 304 396
a 0 304 396
very 0 304 396
good 0 304 396
seminarian 0 304 396
and 0 304 396
will 0 304 396
be 0 304 396
a 0 304 396
good 0 304 396
priest. 0 304 396

But 0 304 397
these 0 304 397
young 0 304 397
men 0 304 397
refuse 0 304 397
to 0 304 397
become 0 304 397
protestants. 0 304 397

They 0 304 398
refuse 0 304 398
to 0 304 398
become 0 304 398
modernist. 0 304 398

They 0 304 399
ask 0 304 399
to 0 304 399
become 0 304 399
true 0 304 399
priests. 0 304 399

And 0 304 400
it 0 304 400
is 0 304 400
a 0 304 400
pity 0 304 400
there 0 304 400
are 0 304 400
not 0 304 400
100 0 304 400
bishops 0 304 400
opening 0 304 400
good 0 304 400
seminaries. 0 304 400

So, 0 304 401
I 0 304 401
ask 0 304 401
you 0 304 401
to 0 304 401
pray 0 304 401
for 0 304 401
these 0 304 401
seminarians 0 304 401
because 0 304 401
when 0 304 401
they 0 304 401
become 0 304 401
priests 0 304 401
they 0 304 401
will 0 304 401
have 0 304 401
many 0 304 401
worries 0 304 401
and 0 304 401
many 0 304 401
difficulties. 0 304 401

I 0 304 402
think, 0 304 402
however, 0 304 402
they 0 304 402
are 0 304 402
very 0 304 402
well 0 304 402
prepared 0 304 402
to 0 304 402
deal 0 304 402
with 0 304 402
these 0 304 402
difficulties 0 304 402
and 0 304 402
worries. 0 304 402

And 0 304 403
we 0 304 403
have 0 304 403
confidence 0 304 403
in 0 304 403
God. 0 304 403

Since 0 304 404
I 0 304 404
began 0 304 404
this 0 304 404
work 0 304 404
six 0 304 404
years 0 304 404
ago, 0 304 404
now, 0 304 404
I 0 304 404
have 0 304 404
evidence 0 304 404
that 0 304 404
God 0 304 404
is 0 304 404
assisting 0 304 404
us. 0 304 404

Because 0 304 405
it 0 304 405
is 0 304 405
impossible, 0 304 405
I 0 304 405
realize, 0 304 405
to 0 304 405
do 0 304 405
this 0 304 405
by 0 304 405
myself. 0 304 405

We 0 304 406
now 0 304 406
have 0 304 406
houses 0 304 406
in 0 304 406
Switzerland 0 304 406
(3), 0 304 406
Munich, 0 304 406
France 0 304 406
(6), 0 304 406
Brussels 0 304 406
(1), 0 304 406
England, 0 304 406
Armada, 0 304 406
San 0 304 406
Francisco, 0 304 406
and 0 304 406
New 0 304 406
York. 0 304 406

In 0 304 407
Albano, 0 304 407
near 0 304 407
Rome, 0 304 407
we 0 304 407
have 0 304 407
a 0 304 407
congregation 0 304 407
of 0 304 407
sisters 0 304 407
where 0 304 407
I 0 304 407
have 0 304 407
five 0 304 407
vocations 0 304 407
from 0 304 407
the 0 304 407
states 0 304 407
(good 0 304 407
sisters). 0 304 407

And 0 304 408
I 0 304 408
am 0 304 408
building 0 304 408
a 0 304 408
seminary 0 304 408
in 0 304 408
Switzerland. 0 304 408

It 1 304 409
is 1 304 409
impossible 1 304 409
to 1 304 409
do 1 304 409
all 1 304 409
this 1 304 409
without 1 304 409
God’s 1 304 409
assistance. 1 304 409

So, 0 304 410
I 0 304 410
have 0 304 410
confidence. 0 304 410

It 0 304 411
is 0 304 411
impossible 0 304 411
for 0 304 411
the 0 304 411
Church 0 304 411
to 0 304 411
change 0 304 411
its 0 304 411
tradition. 0 304 411

The 0 304 412
tradition 0 304 412
of 0 304 412
twenty 0 304 412
centuries. 0 304 412

That 1 304 413
we 1 304 413
cannot 1 304 413
change. 1 304 413

The 0 304 414
Church 0 304 414
is 0 304 414
tradition. 0 304 414

The 1 304 415
Church 1 304 415
is 1 304 415
tradition. 1 304 415

It 0 304 416
is 0 304 416
not 0 304 416
revolution. 0 304 416

I 1 304 417
thank 1 304 417
you 1 304 417
for 1 304 417
your 1 304 417
attention. 1 304 417

According 0 305 3
to 0 305 3
Breitbart, 0 305 3
“Sellner, 0 305 3
who 0 305 3
described 0 305 3
the 0 305 3
detention 0 305 3

as 0 305 3
looking 0 305 3
akin 0 305 3
to 0 305 3
a 0 305 3
typical 0 305 3
American 0 305 3
prison, 0 305 3
said 0 305 3
he 1 305 3
was 1 305 3
told 1 305 3

authorities 1 305 3
that 1 305 3
his 1 305 3
speaking 1 305 3

violence 1 305 3
and 1 305 3
disrupt 1 305 3

That’s 1 305 4
just 1 305 4
what 1 305 4
they 1 305 4
claimed 1 305 4
about 1 305 4

me: 1 305 4
that 1 305 4

and 1 305 4
disrupt 1 305 4
community 1 305 4
cohesion. 1 305 4

But 0 305 5
we, 0 305 5
of 0 305 5
course, 0 305 5
have 0 305 5
never 0 305 5
advocated 0 305 5

cause 0 305 6
violence 0 305 6
from 0 305 6
Muslims. 0 305 6

They 1 305 7
were 1 305 7
bowing 1 305 7
to 1 305 7
jihadist 1 305 7
intimidation. 1 305 7

Meanwhile, 1 305 8

hardline 0 305 9
that 0 305 9

the 0 305 10
fact 0 305 10
that 0 305 10
he 0 305 10

said: 0 305 10
“If 1 305 10
there’s 1 305 10
homosexual 1 305 10
men, 1 305 10
the 1 305 10

is 1 305 10
one 1 305 10
of 1 305 10
five 1 305 10
things. 1 305 10

One 1 305 11
– 1 305 11
the 1 305 11
easiest 1 305 11
one 1 305 11
maybe 1 305 11
– 1 305 11
chop 1 305 11
their 1 305 11
head 1 305 11
off, 1 305 11
that’s 1 305 11
the 1 305 11
easiest. 1 305 11

Second 1 305 12
– 1 305 12
burn 1 305 12
them 1 305 12
to 1 305 12
death. 1 305 12

Third 1 305 13
– 1 305 13
throw 1 305 13
’em 1 305 13
off 1 305 13
a 1 305 13
cliff. 1 305 13

Fourth 1 305 14
– 1 305 14
tear 1 305 14
down 1 305 14
a 1 305 14
wall 1 305 14
on 1 305 14
them 1 305 14
so 1 305 14
they 1 305 14
die 1 305 14
under 1 305 14
that. 1 305 14

Fifth 1 305 15
– 1 305 15
a 1 305 15
combination 1 305 15
of 1 305 15
the 1 305 15
above.” 1 305 15

appeasement-minded 1 305 16

also 0 305 16
admitted 0 305 16
two 0 305 16
jihad 0 305 16

laws. 0 305 16

One 0 305 17
of 0 305 17
them 0 305 17

welcomed 0 305 17
by 0 305 17

only 0 305 18
preachers 0 305 18

well, 0 305 19
even 0 305 19

The 0 307 6
replies 0 307 6
haven’t 0 307 6
topped 0 307 6
out 0 307 6
yet, 0 307 6
at 0 307 6
121, 0 307 6
nearly 0 307 6
all 0 307 6
of 0 307 6
them 0 307 6
expressing 0 307 6
outrage 1 307 6
at 0 307 6
this 0 307 6
cavalier 0 307 6
attitude 0 307 6
toward 0 307 6
the 0 307 6
revelation 0 307 6
that 0 307 6
Cardinal 0 307 6
McCarrick 0 307 6
has 0 307 6
been 0 307 6
proven 0 307 6
to 0 307 6
be 0 307 6
a 1 307 6
life-long 1 307 6
homosexual 1 307 6
rapist 1 307 6
and 1 307 6
sexual 1 307 6
predator, 1 307 6
grooming 0 307 6
and 0 307 6
trapping 0 307 6
young 0 307 6
men 0 307 6
and 0 307 6
children 0 307 6
into 0 307 6
unwanted 0 307 6
sexual 0 307 6
contact; 0 307 6
and 0 307 6
that 0 307 6
nearly 0 307 6
the 0 307 6
entire 0 307 6
episcopate 0 307 6
of 0 307 6
the 0 307 6
United 0 307 6
States 0 307 6
either 0 307 6
colluded 0 307 6
directly 0 307 6
or 0 307 6
kept 0 307 6
quiet 0 307 6
about 0 307 6
it. 0 307 6

It’s 0 307 7
clear 0 307 7
that 0 307 7
even 0 307 7
the 0 307 7
“good 0 307 7
bishops” 0 307 7
have 0 307 7
simply 0 307 7
no 0 307 7
idea 0 307 7
how 0 307 7
close 0 307 7
they 0 307 7
are 0 307 7
to 0 307 7
being 0 307 7
bodily 0 307 7
chucked 0 307 7
out 0 307 7
of 0 307 7
their 0 307 7
own 0 307 7
churches 0 307 7
by 0 307 7
furious 0 307 7
mobs. 0 307 7

As 0 307 8
I 0 307 8
wrote 0 307 8
elsewhere, 0 307 8
since 0 307 8
2002, 0 307 8
most 0 307 8
Catholics 0 307 8
know 0 307 8
perfectly 1 307 8
well, 0 307 8
despite 0 307 8
the 0 307 8
lame 1 307 8
whitewashing 0 307 8
attempt, 0 307 8
that 0 307 8
“the 0 307 8
US 0 307 8
bishops 0 307 8
gave 0 307 8
themselves 0 307 8
a 0 307 8
pass” 0 307 8
on 0 307 8
clerical 0 307 8
sex 0 307 8
abuse 0 307 8
with 0 307 8
the 0 307 8
Dallas 0 307 8
Charter 0 307 8
“a 0 307 8
thing 0 307 8
that 0 307 8
brazenly 0 307 8
shifted 0 307 8
blame.” 0 307 8
And 0 307 8
it 0 307 8
seems 0 307 8
that 0 307 8
though 0 307 8
they’re 0 307 8
still 0 307 8
doing 0 307 8
this, 0 307 8
quite 0 307 8
a 0 307 8
few 0 307 8
lay 0 307 8
Catholics 0 307 8
just 0 307 8
aren’t 0 307 8
having 0 307 8
it. 0 307 8

We 0 307 9
are 0 307 9
seeing 0 307 9
the 0 307 9
final 0 307 9
slide, 0 307 9
the 0 307 9
expected 0 307 9
and 0 307 9
inevitable 0 307 9
result 0 307 9
of 0 307 9
the 0 307 9
last 0 307 9
100 0 307 9
years. 0 307 9

The 0 307 10
Church 0 307 10
was 0 307 10
infiltrated, 0 307 10
we 0 307 10
know 0 307 10
this, 0 307 10
in 0 307 10
the 0 307 10
19th 0 307 10
century 0 307 10
by 0 307 10
some 0 307 10
pretty 0 307 10
dark 1 307 10
forces, 1 307 10
and 0 307 10
they 0 307 10
have 0 307 10
finally 0 307 10
come 0 307 10
into 0 307 10
the 0 307 10
ascendancy 0 307 10
and 0 307 10
are 0 307 10
showing 0 307 10
themselves 0 307 10
quite 0 307 10
clearly 0 307 10
for 0 307 10
what 0 307 10
they 0 307 10
are. 0 307 10

The 0 307 11
McCarrick 0 307 11
news 0 307 11
– 0 307 11
and 0 307 11
all 0 307 11
the 0 307 11
stuff 0 307 11
swirling 0 307 11
around 0 307 11
it 0 307 11
like 0 307 11
the 0 307 11
latest 0 307 11
about 0 307 11
Bishop 0 307 11
Pineda 0 307 11
and 0 307 11
his 0 307 11
connection 0 307 11
to 0 307 11
Pope 0 307 11
Francis 0 307 11
through 0 307 11
Cardinal 0 307 11
Maradiaga 0 307 11
– 0 307 11
has 0 307 11
not 0 307 11
come 0 307 11
in 0 307 11
contrast 0 307 11
to 0 307 11
this 0 307 11
but 0 307 11
as 0 307 11
an 0 307 11
intrinsic 0 307 11
part 0 307 11
of 0 307 11
it. 0 307 11

The 0 307 12
scandal 0 307 12
of 0 307 12
McCarrick 0 307 12
is 0 307 12
simply 0 307 12
a 0 307 12
toxic 1 307 12
emission, 0 307 12
a 0 307 12
venting 0 307 12
of 0 307 12
the 0 307 12
gasses 0 307 12
that 0 307 12
build 0 307 12
up 0 307 12
naturally 0 307 12
around 0 307 12
any 0 307 12
rotting 1 307 12
thing. 0 307 12

Rod 0 307 13
Dreher[1] 0 307 13
is 0 307 13
doing 0 307 13
excellent 0 307 13
work 0 307 13
compiling 0 307 13
testimony 0 307 13
from 0 307 13
priests 0 307 13
and 0 307 13
others 0 307 13
saying 0 307 13
out 0 307 13
loud 0 307 13
at 0 307 13
last 0 307 13
what 0 307 13
many 0 307 13
of 0 307 13
us 0 307 13
had 0 307 13
known 0 307 13
for 0 307 13
many 0 307 13
years 0 307 13
about 0 307 13
McCarrick 0 307 13
and 0 307 13
his 0 307 13
gang. 0 307 13

It 0 307 14
has 0 307 14
shown 0 307 14
the 0 307 14
world 0 307 14
what 0 307 14
Traditionalists 0 307 14
have 0 307 14
known, 0 307 14
that 0 307 14
it 0 307 14
is 0 307 14
emphatically 0 307 14
NOT 0 307 14
the 0 307 14
result 0 307 14
of 0 307 14
one 0 307 14
“bad 0 307 14
apple” 0 307 14
or 0 307 14
even 0 307 14
only 0 307 14
a 0 307 14
“few” 0 307 14
as 0 307 14
the 0 307 14
hapless 0 307 14
“conservative” 0 307 14
Bishop 0 307 14
Tobin 0 307 14
tried 0 307 14
to 0 307 14
claim 0 307 14
on 0 307 14
Twitter. 0 307 14

This 0 307 15
is 0 307 15
the 0 307 15
result 0 307 15
of 0 307 15
a 0 307 15
mass-collusion. 0 307 15

As 0 307 16
our 0 307 16
friend 0 307 16
Steve 0 307 16
Skojec 0 307 16
put 0 307 16
it 0 307 16
the 0 307 16
other 0 307 16
day, 0 307 16
“We’ve 0 307 16
got 0 307 16
to 0 307 16
stop 0 307 16
pretending 0 307 16
it’s 0 307 16
just 0 307 16
the 0 307 16
progressive 0 307 16
element 0 307 16
in 0 307 16
the 0 307 16
Church. 0 307 16

The 0 307 17
‘conservatives’ 0 307 17
are 0 307 17
complicit, 0 307 17
too.” 0 307 17
In 0 307 17
short, 0 307 17
as 0 307 17
it 0 307 17
was 0 307 17
during 0 307 17
his 0 307 17
days 0 307 17
of 0 307 17
glory, 0 307 17
globe 0 307 17
trotting 0 307 17
on 0 307 17
the 0 307 17
dime 0 307 17
of 0 307 17
the 0 307 17
State 0 307 17
Department, 0 307 17
hosting 0 307 17
presidents 0 307 17
for 0 307 17
dinner 0 307 17
and 0 307 17
inviting 0 307 17
John 0 307 17
Paul 0 307 17
II 0 307 17
and 0 307 17
Mother 0 307 17
Theresa 0 307 17
to 0 307 17
tea, 0 307 17
so 0 307 17
it 0 307 17
is 0 307 17
now: 0 307 17
McCarrick 0 307 17
is 0 307 17
the 0 307 17
face 0 307 17
of 0 307 17
the 0 307 17
New 0 307 17
Paradigm. 0 307 17

Whether 0 307 18
he 0 307 18
now 0 307 18
has 0 307 18
to 0 307 18
go 0 307 18
live 0 307 18
in 0 307 18
obscurity 0 307 18
in 0 307 18
some 0 307 18
beach 0 307 18
house 0 307 18
in 0 307 18
the 0 307 18
Caymans, 0 307 18
it 0 307 18
will 0 307 18
remain 0 307 18
true: 0 307 18
McCarrick 0 307 18
is 0 307 18
the 0 307 18
“New 0 307 18
Church.” 0 307 18

A 0 307 19
point 0 307 19
that 0 307 19
Dreher’s 0 307 19
informants 0 307 19
have 0 307 19
brought 0 307 19
up 0 307 19
needs 0 307 19
to 0 307 19
be 0 307 19
made 0 307 19
emphatic: 0 307 19
the 0 307 19
homosexualist 1 307 19
cabal 1 307 19
that 0 307 19
is 0 307 19
currently 0 307 19
reported 0 307 19
to 0 307 19
be 0 307 19
dominant 0 307 19
in 0 307 19
the 0 307 19
Catholic 0 307 19
hierarchy 0 307 19
(and 0 307 19
don’t 0 307 19
imagine 0 307 19
this 0 307 19
is 0 307 19
confined 0 307 19
to 0 307 19
the 0 307 19
United 0 307 19
States 0 307 19
or 0 307 19
even 0 307 19
to 0 307 19
the 0 307 19
English 0 307 19
speaking 0 307 19
world) 0 307 19
have 0 307 19
a 0 307 19
well 0 307 19
documented 0 307 19
methodology 0 307 19
of 0 307 19
mutual 0 307 19
protection-and-threat 0 307 19
that 0 307 19
keeps 0 307 19
the 0 307 19
whole 0 307 19
apparatus 0 307 19
afloat. 0 307 19

In 0 307 20
briefest 0 307 20
and 0 307 20
simplest 0 307 20
possible 0 307 20
terms, 0 307 20
immoral 0 307 20
or 0 307 20
even 0 307 20
illegal 0 307 20
sexual 0 307 20
activity 0 307 20
is 0 307 20
preferred 0 307 20
because 0 307 20
it 0 307 20
leaves 0 307 20
a 0 307 20
man 0 307 20
open 0 307 20
to 0 307 20
blackmail, 0 307 20
to 0 307 20
control 0 307 20
through 0 307 20
fear 0 307 20
of 0 307 20
exposure[2]. 0 307 20

When 0 307 21
that 0 307 21
blackmailing 0 307 21
culture 0 307 21
becomes 0 307 21
ascendant, 0 307 21
it 0 307 21
will 0 307 21
always 0 307 21
reject 0 307 21
the 0 307 21
morally 0 307 21
upright 0 307 21
as 0 307 21
too 0 307 21
dangerous, 0 307 21
too 0 307 21
difficult 0 307 21
to 0 307 21
control. 0 307 21

This 0 307 22
is 0 307 22
why 0 307 22
faithful 0 307 22
seminarians 0 307 22
are 0 307 22
rejected 0 307 22
and 0 307 22
why 0 307 22
faithful 0 307 22
priests 0 307 22
are 0 307 22
harassed. 0 307 22

As 0 307 23
Dreher 0 307 23
reported, 0 307 23

When 0 307 24
predatory 1 307 24
gay 1 307 24
priests 1 307 24
run 0 307 24
seminaries, 0 307 24
they 0 307 24
select 0 307 24
on 0 307 24
a 0 307 24
bias 0 307 24
for 0 307 24
gay 0 307 24
candidates... 0 307 24

Gay 0 307 25
seminarians 0 307 25
who 0 307 25
intend 0 307 25
to 0 307 25
be 0 307 25
celibate, 0 307 25
Sipe 0 307 25
said, 0 307 25
face 0 307 25
tremendous 0 307 25
pressure 0 307 25
to 0 307 25
have 0 307 25
sex. 0 307 25

If 0 307 26
they 0 307 26
slip 0 307 26
up 0 307 26
even 0 307 26
once, 0 307 26
their 0 307 26
failure 0 307 26
will 0 307 26
be 0 307 26
noted, 0 307 26
and 0 307 26
shared… 0 307 26
And 0 307 26
they 0 307 26
will 0 307 26
be 0 307 26
made 0 307 26
to 0 307 26
understand 0 307 26
that 0 307 26
their 0 307 26
lapse 0 307 26
is 0 307 26
remembered. 0 307 26

Later, 0 307 27
as 0 307 27
a 0 307 27
priest, 0 307 27
predators 0 307 27
within 0 307 27
the 0 307 27
priesthood 0 307 27
have 0 307 27
that 0 307 27
knowledge 0 307 27
to 0 307 27
hold 0 307 27
over 0 307 27
the 0 307 27
heads 0 307 27
of 0 307 27
other 0 307 27
gay 0 307 27
priests, 0 307 27
to 0 307 27
keep 0 307 27
them 0 307 27
silent 0 307 27
if 0 307 27
they 0 307 27
ever 0 307 27
have 0 307 27
the 0 307 27
desire 0 307 27
to 0 307 27
blow 0 307 27
whistles. 0 307 27

When 0 307 28
I 0 307 28
was 0 307 28
covering 0 307 28
the 0 307 28
scandal 0 307 28
in 0 307 28
the 0 307 28
early 0 307 28
2000s, 0 307 28
I 0 307 28
spoke 0 307 28
to 0 307 28
several, 0 307 28
unconnected 0 307 28
heterosexual 0 307 28
men 0 307 28
— 0 307 28
priests, 0 307 28
former 0 307 28
priests, 0 307 28
seminarians 0 307 28
— 0 307 28
who 0 307 28
said 0 307 28
that 0 307 28
gay 0 307 28
seminary 0 307 28
rectors 0 307 28
or 0 307 28
diocesan 0 307 28
officials 0 307 28
encouraged 0 307 28
them 0 307 28
to 0 307 28
take 0 307 28
female 0 307 28
sexual 0 307 28
partners, 0 307 28
so 0 307 28
that 0 307 28
they 0 307 28
too 0 307 28
would 0 307 28
be 0 307 28
complicit 0 307 28
in 0 307 28
sexual 0 307 28
secret-keeping, 0 307 28
and 0 307 28
therefore 0 307 28
no 0 307 28
longer 0 307 28
[be] 0 307 28
a 0 307 28
potential 0 307 28
danger. 0 307 28

Nothing 0 307 29
in 0 307 29
a 0 307 29
system 0 307 29
like 0 307 29
that 0 307 29
is 0 307 29
a 0 307 29
greater 0 307 29
threat 0 307 29
to 0 307 29
the 0 307 29
corrupt 0 307 29
than 0 307 29
men 0 307 29
who 0 307 29
are 0 307 29
not 0 307 29
corrupt. 0 307 29

For 0 307 30
many 0 307 30
priests, 0 307 30
one 0 307 30
might 0 307 30
say 0 307 30
all 0 307 30
good 0 307 30
priests, 0 307 30
this 0 307 30
is 0 307 30
not 0 307 30
a 0 307 30
sustainable 0 307 30
situation, 0 307 30
to 0 307 30
say 0 307 30
the 0 307 30
least. 0 307 30

I’ve 0 307 31
had 0 307 31
quite 0 307 31
a 0 307 31
few 0 307 31
conversations 0 307 31
with 0 307 31
priests 0 307 31
who 0 307 31
are 0 307 31
now 0 307 31
asking 0 307 31
how 0 307 31
to 0 307 31
deal 0 307 31
with 0 307 31
it. 0 307 31

How 0 307 32
are 0 307 32
they 0 307 32
to 0 307 32
continue 0 307 32
to 0 307 32
offer 0 307 32
the 0 307 32
sacraments 0 307 32
in 0 307 32
this 0 307 32
situation? 0 307 32

Where 0 307 33
are 0 307 33
they 0 307 33
to 0 307 33
live? 0 307 33

How 0 307 34
are 0 307 34
they 0 307 34
to 0 307 34
maintain 0 307 34
themselves? 0 307 34

These 0 307 35
are 0 307 35
the 0 307 35
priests 0 307 35
who 0 307 35
did 0 307 35
make 0 307 35
it 0 307 35
through 0 307 35
this 0 307 35
institutional 0 307 35
gauntlet, 0 307 35
who 0 307 35
remain 0 307 35
faithful 0 307 35
now 0 307 35
but 0 307 35
are 0 307 35
still 0 307 35
under 0 307 35
the 0 307 35
control 0 307 35
of 0 307 35
these 0 307 35
often 0 307 35
grossly 1 307 35
corrupt 1 307 35
and 1 307 35
evil 1 307 35
men. 1 307 35

As 0 307 36
men 0 307 36
known 0 307 36
to 0 307 36
be 0 307 36
incorruptible 0 307 36
themselves, 0 307 36
there 0 307 36
is 0 307 36
a 0 307 36
big 0 307 36
target 0 307 36
painted 0 307 36
on 0 307 36
their 0 307 36
backs. 0 307 36

In 0 307 37
short, 0 307 37
not 0 307 37
only 0 307 37
can 0 307 37
a 0 307 37
bad 0 307 37
bishop 0 307 37
harry 0 307 37
a 0 307 37
man 0 307 37
out 0 307 37
of 0 307 37
his 0 307 37
ministry, 0 307 37
he 0 307 37
has 0 307 37
complete 0 307 37
control 0 307 37
over 0 307 37
the 0 307 37
priest’s 0 307 37
material 0 307 37
life. 0 307 37

The 0 307 38
bishop 0 307 38
can, 0 307 38
with 0 307 38
the 0 307 38
flick 0 307 38
of 0 307 38
a 0 307 38
pen 0 307 38
or 0 307 38
a 0 307 38
single 0 307 38
phone 0 307 38
call, 0 307 38
render 0 307 38
a 0 307 38
priest 0 307 38
homeless, 0 307 38
penniless 0 307 38
and 0 307 38
jobless. 0 307 38

And 0 307 39
these, 0 307 39
remember, 0 307 39
are 0 307 39
men, 0 307 39
often 0 307 39
well 0 307 39
on 0 307 39
in 0 307 39
years, 0 307 39
whose 0 307 39
only 0 307 39
education 0 307 39
and 0 307 39
employment 0 307 39
training 0 307 39
has 0 307 39
likely 0 307 39
been 0 307 39
academic 0 307 39
degrees 0 307 39
in 0 307 39
philosophy 0 307 39
and 0 307 39
theology, 0 307 39
and 0 307 39
whose 0 307 39
only 0 307 39
professional 0 307 39
contacts 0 307 39
are 0 307 39
ecclesiastical. 0 307 39

Moreover, 0 307 40
because 0 307 40
of 0 307 40
the 0 307 40
globalisation 0 307 40
of 0 307 40
the 0 307 40
bishop-network, 0 307 40
a 0 307 40
man 0 307 40
blackballed 0 307 40
for 0 307 40
his 0 307 40
authentic 0 307 40
Catholicity 0 307 40
will 0 307 40
be 0 307 40
a 0 307 40
pariah 0 307 40
in 0 307 40
every 0 307 40
diocese 0 307 40
in 0 307 40
the 0 307 40
world. 0 307 40

And 0 307 41
with 0 307 41
the 0 307 41
advent 0 307 41
of 0 307 41
Bergoglio 0 307 41
in 0 307 41
Rome, 0 307 41
there 0 307 41
are 0 307 41
no 0 307 41
more 0 307 41
havens; 0 307 41
as 0 307 41
many 0 307 41
of 0 307 41
the 0 307 41
former 0 307 41
Franciscan 0 307 41
Friars 0 307 41
of 0 307 41
the 0 307 41
Immaculate 0 307 41
have 0 307 41
learned, 0 307 41
the 0 307 41
blackballing 0 307 41
has 0 307 41
gone 0 307 41
global 0 307 41
with 0 307 41
this 0 307 41
pontificate. 0 307 41

He 0 307 42
will 0 307 42
remain 0 307 42
a 0 307 42
pariah 0 307 42
even 0 307 42
among 0 307 42
the 0 307 42
so-called 0 307 42
“good” 0 307 42
bishops 0 307 42
who 0 307 42
live 0 307 42
in 0 307 42
terror 0 307 42
of 0 307 42
the 0 307 42
immense 0 307 42
power 0 307 42
of 0 307 42
the 0 307 42
cabal… 0 307 42
(see 0 307 42
above 0 307 42
re: 0 307 42
McCarrick 0 307 42
& 0 307 42
President 0 307 42
Bush/John 0 307 42
Paul 0 307 42
II.) 0 307 42

I 0 307 43
have 0 307 43
been 0 307 43
hearing 0 307 43
from 0 307 43
priests 0 307 43
who 0 307 43
are 0 307 43
saying 0 307 43
in 0 307 43
effect, 0 307 43
“We’re 0 307 43
trapped 0 307 43
in 0 307 43
this 0 307 43
situation 0 307 43
and 0 307 43
forced 0 307 43
to 0 307 43
remain 0 307 43
silent 0 307 43
because 0 307 43
if 0 307 43
we 0 307 43
don’t 0 307 43
we’ll 0 307 43
not 0 307 43
only 0 307 43
be 0 307 43
unable 0 307 43
to 0 307 43
function 0 307 43
as 0 307 43
priests, 0 307 43
but 0 307 43
we’ll 0 307 43
be 0 307 43
homeless 0 307 43
and 0 307 43
penniless. 0 307 43

We’re 0 307 44
unemployable 0 307 44
in 0 307 44
any 0 307 44
other 0 307 44
field.” 0 307 44
And 0 307 44
as 0 307 44
much 0 307 44
as 0 307 44
we 0 307 44
might 0 307 44
be 0 307 44
tempted 0 307 44
to 0 307 44
say, 0 307 44
“Well 1 307 44
suck 1 307 44
it 1 307 44
up, 1 307 44
this 0 307 44
is 0 307 44
for 0 307 44
the 0 307 44
good 0 307 44
of 0 307 44
souls,” 0 307 44
the 0 307 44
reality 0 307 44
is 0 307 44
that 0 307 44
these 0 307 44
are 0 307 44
not 0 307 44
small 0 307 44
considerations. 0 307 44

Many 0 307 45
priests 0 307 45
are 0 307 45
getting 0 307 45
older 0 307 45
– 0 307 45
many 0 307 45
of 0 307 45
them 0 307 45
with 0 307 45
health 0 307 45
issues 0 307 45
– 0 307 45
and 0 307 45
a 0 307 45
man 0 307 45
who 0 307 45
has 0 307 45
already 0 307 45
given 0 307 45
20 0 307 45
or 0 307 45
30 0 307 45
years 0 307 45
of 0 307 45
his 0 307 45
life 0 307 45
to 0 307 45
the 0 307 45
Church 0 307 45
is 0 307 45
faced 0 307 45
with 0 307 45
a 0 307 45
practical 0 307 45
impossibility 0 307 45
if 0 307 45
he 0 307 45
finds 0 307 45
himself 0 307 45
blacklisted. 0 307 45

Of 0 307 46
course 0 307 46
there 0 307 46
are 0 307 46
some 0 307 46
who 0 307 46
don’t 0 307 46
fit 0 307 46
this 0 307 46
mould; 0 307 46
there 0 307 46
are 0 307 46
a 0 307 46
lot 0 307 46
of 0 307 46
second 0 307 46
careers 0 307 46
in 0 307 46
the 0 307 46
priesthood 0 307 46
and 0 307 46
plenty 0 307 46
of 0 307 46
people 0 307 46
go 0 307 46
into 0 307 46
seminary 0 307 46
after 0 307 46
some 0 307 46
years 0 307 46
in 0 307 46
the 0 307 46
normal 0 307 46
workforce 0 307 46
and 0 307 46
can 0 307 46
go 0 307 46
back 0 307 46
to 0 307 46
it 0 307 46
at 0 307 46
need. 0 307 46

Some 0 307 47
of 0 307 47
the 0 307 47
men 0 307 47
now 0 307 47
coming 0 307 47
forward 0 307 47
with 0 307 47
complaints 0 307 47
against 0 307 47
McCarrick, 0 307 47
who 0 307 47
left 0 307 47
the 0 307 47
priesthood 0 307 47
over 0 307 47
their 0 307 47
experiences, 0 307 47
have 0 307 47
gone 0 307 47
on 0 307 47
to 0 307 47
have 0 307 47
normal, 0 307 47
healthy 0 307 47
working 0 307 47
lives. 0 307 47

But 0 307 48
I 0 307 48
think 0 307 48
honestly 0 307 48
most 0 307 48
priests 0 307 48
are 0 307 48
in 0 307 48
this 0 307 48
corner 0 307 48
and 0 307 48
they 0 307 48
know 0 307 48
it 0 307 48
and 0 307 48
so 0 307 48
do 0 307 48
their 0 307 48
bishops. 0 307 48

I 0 307 49
think 0 307 49
a 0 307 49
young 0 307 49
man 0 307 49
goes 0 307 49
forward 0 307 49
in 0 307 49
great 0 307 49
faith, 0 307 49
spends 0 307 49
ten 0 307 49
to 0 307 49
fifteen 0 307 49
years 0 307 49
studying 0 307 49
philosophy 0 307 49
and 0 307 49
theology 0 307 49
- 0 307 49
fields 0 307 49
that 0 307 49
have 0 307 49
almost 0 307 49
no 0 307 49
application 0 307 49
in 0 307 49
the 0 307 49
workforce 0 307 49
outside 0 307 49
academia 0 307 49
or 0 307 49
the 0 307 49
Church 0 307 49
- 0 307 49
with 0 307 49
the 0 307 49
honest, 0 307 49
and 0 307 49
frankly 0 307 49
fair, 0 307 49
expectation 0 307 49
of 0 307 49
a 0 307 49
lifetime 0 307 49
of 0 307 49
employment 0 307 49
and 0 307 49
a 0 307 49
safety 0 307 49
net 0 307 49
at 0 307 49
the 0 307 49
end. 0 307 49

As 0 307 50
one 0 307 50
of 0 307 50
them 0 307 50
said 0 307 50
to 0 307 50
me, 0 307 50
“The 0 307 50
old 0 307 50
arrangement 0 307 50
was, 0 307 50
‘Remain 0 307 50
faithful, 0 307 50
do 0 307 50
the 0 307 50
work, 0 307 50
and 0 307 50
we 0 307 50
will 0 307 50
look 0 307 50
after 0 307 50
you. 0 307 50

We’ll 0 307 51
house, 0 307 51
feed 0 307 51
and 0 307 51
clothe 0 307 51
you 0 307 51
and 0 307 51
look 0 307 51
after 0 307 51
your 0 307 51
retirement.’ 0 307 51
The 0 307 51
new 0 307 51
arrangement 0 307 51
is 0 307 51
a 0 307 51
perversion 0 307 51
of 0 307 51
that: 0 307 51
‘Keep 0 307 51
quiet 0 307 51
and 0 307 51
go 0 307 51
along 0 307 51
with 0 307 51
it 0 307 51
all 0 307 51
and 0 307 51
you’ll 0 307 51
be 0 307 51
fine, 0 307 51
but 0 307 51
step 0 307 51
an 0 307 51
inch 0 307 51
out 0 307 51
of 0 307 51
line 0 307 51
and 0 307 51
we’ll 1 307 51
destroy 1 307 51
you.’” 1 307 51

So 0 307 52
what 0 307 52
do 0 307 52
we 0 307 52
do? 0 307 52

The 0 307 53
Old 0 307 53
Paradigm 0 307 53
is 0 307 53
destroyed 0 307 53
and 0 307 53
going 0 307 53
along 0 307 53
with 0 307 53
the 0 307 53
New 0 307 53
Paradigm 0 307 53
is 0 307 53
a 0 307 53
guarantee 0 307 53
of 0 307 53
destruction 0 307 53
for 0 307 53
yourself 0 307 53
and 0 307 53
everyone 0 307 53
else. 0 307 53

As 0 307 54
we 0 307 54
saw 0 307 54
in 0 307 54
Ireland 0 307 54
this 0 307 54
week, 0 307 54
the 0 307 54
Purge 0 307 54
has 0 307 54
started. 0 307 54

It’s 0 307 55
not 0 307 55
enough 0 307 55
to 0 307 55
simply 0 307 55
demand 0 307 55
that 0 307 55
a 0 307 55
priest 0 307 55
continue 0 307 55
in 0 307 55
his 0 307 55
ministry 0 307 55
no 0 307 55
matter 0 307 55
what. 0 307 55

We 0 307 56
need 0 307 56
to 0 307 56
start 0 307 56
working 0 307 56
together 0 307 56
with 0 307 56
faithful 0 307 56
priests 0 307 56
– 0 307 56
while 0 307 56
there 0 307 56
still 0 307 56
are 0 307 56
some 0 307 56
– 0 307 56
to 0 307 56
help 0 307 56
them 0 307 56
create 0 307 56
practical 0 307 56
material 0 307 56
alternatives. 0 307 56

If 0 307 57
we 0 307 57
who 0 307 57
still 0 307 57
love 0 307 57
the 0 307 57
Church 0 307 57
want 0 307 57
priests 0 307 57
to 0 307 57
be 0 307 57
faithful, 0 307 57
and 0 307 57
even 0 307 57
to 0 307 57
start 0 307 57
denouncing 0 307 57
the 0 307 57
evil 0 307 57
and 0 307 57
corruption 0 307 57
they 0 307 57
see, 0 307 57
we 0 307 57
are 0 307 57
going 0 307 57
to 0 307 57
have 0 307 57
to 0 307 57
help 0 307 57
them 0 307 57
create 0 307 57
a 0 307 57
modicum 0 307 57
of 0 307 57
independence 0 307 57
and 0 307 57
security 0 307 57
in 0 307 57
which 0 307 57
to 0 307 57
do 0 307 57
it. 0 307 57

The 0 307 58
other 0 307 58
day 0 307 58
the 0 307 58
American 0 307 58
conservative 0 307 58
writer, 0 307 58
John 0 307 58
Zmirak, 0 307 58
wrote 0 307 58
a 0 307 58
sound 0 307 58
suggestion 0 307 58
on 0 307 58
Twitter 0 307 58
that 0 307 58
I 0 307 58
think 0 307 58
it’s 0 307 58
time 0 307 58
we 0 307 58
all 0 307 58
started 0 307 58
taking 0 307 58
seriously. 0 307 58

In 0 307 59
response 0 307 59
to 0 307 59
the 0 307 59
continued 0 307 59
outrages 0 307 59
of 0 307 59
both 0 307 59
“good” 0 307 59
and 0 307 59
bad 0 307 59
bishops, 0 307 59
Zmirak 0 307 59
suggested 0 307 59
establishing 0 307 59
“an 0 307 59
escrow 0 307 59
fund 0 307 59
in 0 307 59
each 0 307 59
scandal-plagued 0 307 59
diocese, 0 307 59
where 0 307 59
laymen 0 307 59
[can] 0 307 59
deposit 0 307 59
the 0 307 59
funds 0 307 59
they 0 307 59
would 0 307 59
have 0 307 59
donated 0 307 59
to 0 307 59
[the] 0 307 59
local 0 307 59
church, 0 307 59
until 0 307 59
[a] 0 307 59
new 0 307 59
bishop 0 307 59
[is] 0 307 59
appointed.” 0 307 59

I 0 307 60
responded: 0 307 60
“And 0 307 60
the 0 307 60
money 0 307 60
could 0 307 60
be 0 307 60
used 0 307 60
to 0 307 60
purchase 0 307 60
properties 0 307 60
to 0 307 60
house 0 307 60
faithful 0 307 60
priests 0 307 60
punished 0 307 60
by 0 307 60
their 0 307 60
bishops 0 307 60
for 0 307 60
refusing 0 307 60
the 0 307 60
New 0 307 60
Paradigm. 0 307 60

We 0 307 61
could 0 307 61
even 0 307 61
perhaps 0 307 61
buy 0 307 61
a 0 307 61
few 0 307 61
convents 0 307 61
so 0 307 61
contemplative 0 307 61
nuns 0 307 61
could 0 307 61
continue 0 307 61
to 0 307 61
pray 0 307 61
in 0 307 61
peace, 0 307 61
without 0 307 61
harassment 0 307 61
from 0 307 61
the 0 307 61
evil 0 307 61
men 0 307 61
in 0 307 61
Rome.” 0 307 61

I 0 307 62
am 0 307 62
hearing 0 307 62
lately 0 307 62
from 0 307 62
laymen 0 307 62
who 0 307 62
are 0 307 62
starting 0 307 62
to 0 307 62
talk 0 307 62
about 0 307 62
setting 0 307 62
up 0 307 62
financial 0 307 62
structures 0 307 62
to 0 307 62
ensure 0 307 62
that 0 307 62
the 0 307 62
authentic 0 307 62
Catholic 0 307 62
life 0 307 62
can 0 307 62
be 0 307 62
maintained 0 307 62
through 0 307 62
what 0 307 62
is 0 307 62
obviously 0 307 62
soon 0 307 62
to 0 307 62
be 0 307 62
a 0 307 62
general 0 307 62
collapse 0 307 62
of 0 307 62
the 0 307 62
institution. 0 307 62

This 0 307 63
would 0 307 63
mean 0 307 63
independent 0 307 63
non-profit 0 307 63
foundations 0 307 63
that 0 307 63
could 0 307 63
build 0 307 63
or 0 307 63
buy 0 307 63
church 0 307 63
buildings, 0 307 63
convents 0 307 63
and 0 307 63
even 0 307 63
schools 0 307 63
and 0 307 63
provide 0 307 63
salaries 0 307 63
for 0 307 63
priests 0 307 63
and 0 307 63
other 0 307 63
staff. 0 307 63

I 0 307 64
started 0 307 64
thinking 0 307 64
about 0 307 64
this 0 307 64
recently 0 307 64
when 0 307 64
I 0 307 64
received 0 307 64
a 0 307 64
note 0 307 64
from 0 307 64
a 0 307 64
reader 0 307 64
with 0 307 64
a 0 307 64
link 0 307 64
to 0 307 64
an 0 307 64
online 0 307 64
petition 0 307 64
from 0 307 64
Germany, 0 307 64
addressed 0 307 64
to 0 307 64
the 0 307 64
German 0 307 64
bishops 0 307 64
[!!!] 0 307 64

“begging” 0 307 65
those 0 307 65
manifestly 1 307 65
evil 1 307 65
and 1 307 65
apostate 1 307 65
men 1 307 65
not 0 307 65
to 0 307 65
close 0 307 65
a 0 307 65
famous 0 307 65
and 0 307 65
ancient 0 307 65
monastic 0 307 65
house. 0 307 65

I 0 307 66
responded 0 307 66
that 0 307 66
this 0 307 66
was 0 307 66
going 0 307 66
about 0 307 66
things 0 307 66
the 0 307 66
wrong 0 307 66
way. 0 307 66

Catholics 0 307 67
are 0 307 67
going 0 307 67
to 0 307 67
have 0 307 67
to 0 307 67
get 0 307 67
their 0 307 67
heads 0 307 67
out 0 307 67
of 0 307 67
the 0 307 67
mindset 0 307 67
that 0 307 67
they 0 307 67
are 0 307 67
helpless 0 307 67
petitioners, 0 307 67
“begging” 0 307 67
the 0 307 67
hierarchy 0 307 67
to 0 307 67
maintain 0 307 67
the 0 307 67
Faith. 0 307 67

First 0 307 68
of 0 307 68
all, 0 307 68
it 0 307 68
only 0 307 68
gives 0 307 68
them 0 307 68
a 0 307 68
frisson 0 307 68
of 0 307 68
pleasure 0 307 68
to 0 307 68
see 0 307 68
us 0 307 68
groveling 0 307 68
and 0 307 68
begging 0 307 68
for 0 307 68
mercy. 0 307 68

Let’s 0 307 69
not 0 307 69
give 0 307 69
them 0 307 69
that, 0 307 69
OK? 0 307 69

There’s 0 307 70
already 0 307 70
enough 0 307 70
“frissons 0 307 70
of 0 307 70
pleasure” 0 307 70
in 0 307 70
their 0 307 70
lives. 0 307 70

Second, 0 307 71
it’s 0 307 71
simply 0 307 71
not 0 307 71
going 0 307 71
to 0 307 71
work. 0 307 71

In 0 307 72
Germany, 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
the 0 307 72
US, 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
Canada, 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
Italy, 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
Britain… 0 307 72
throughout 0 307 72
the 0 307 72
Church 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
the 0 307 72
1st 0 307 72
world, 0 307 72
and 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
much 0 307 72
of 0 307 72
it 0 307 72
elsewhere, 0 307 72
the 0 307 72
men 0 307 72
in 0 307 72
charge 0 307 72
of 0 307 72
the 0 307 72
“institutional 0 307 72
Church” 0 307 72
– 0 307 72
that 0 307 72
is, 0 307 72
whose 0 307 72
names 0 307 72
are 0 307 72
on 0 307 72
the 0 307 72
bank 0 307 72
accounts 0 307 72
– 0 307 72
are 0 307 72
dedicated 1 307 72
to 1 307 72
the 1 307 72
destruction 1 307 72
of 1 307 72
everything 1 307 72
we 1 307 72
want 1 307 72
to 1 307 72
preserve. 1 307 72

The 0 307 73
wolves 1 307 73
are 0 307 73
now 0 307 73
looking 0 307 73
with 0 307 73
ravening 0 307 73
eyes 0 307 73
at 0 307 73
the 0 307 73
faithful. 0 307 73

They 0 307 74
are, 0 307 74
in 0 307 74
short, 0 307 74
our 1 307 74
enemies. 1 307 74

They’ve 0 307 75
become 0 307 75
so 0 307 75
by 0 307 75
making 0 307 75
themselves 0 307 75
the 0 307 75
enemies 0 307 75
of 0 307 75
Christ 0 307 75
and 0 307 75
His 0 307 75
Holy 0 307 75
Church. 0 307 75

They 0 307 76
know 0 307 76
it 0 307 76
and 0 307 76
it’s 0 307 76
time 0 307 76
we 0 307 76
stopped 0 307 76
imagining 0 307 76
otherwise. 0 307 76

The 0 307 77
other 0 307 77
suggestion 0 307 77
I 0 307 77
have 0 307 77
is 0 307 77
for 0 307 77
young 0 307 77
men 0 307 77
interested 0 307 77
in 0 307 77
the 0 307 77
priesthood 0 307 77
to 0 307 77
fortify 0 307 77
themselves 0 307 77
not 0 307 77
only 0 307 77
spiritually 0 307 77
but 0 307 77
in 0 307 77
the 0 307 77
material 0 307 77
sphere. 0 307 77

There’s 0 307 78
one 0 307 78
big 0 307 78
vulnerability 0 307 78
we 0 307 78
can 0 307 78
guard 0 307 78
against 0 307 78
pretty 0 307 78
easily. 0 307 78

No 0 307 79
one 0 307 79
should 0 307 79
be 0 307 79
facing 0 307 79
penury 0 307 79
and 0 307 79
permanent 0 307 79
unemployment 0 307 79
because 0 307 79
he’s 0 307 79
a 0 307 79
faithful 0 307 79
Catholic. 0 307 79

We 0 307 80
should 0 307 80
never 0 307 80
be 0 307 80
letting 0 307 80
any 0 307 80
young 0 307 80
man 0 307 80
go 0 307 80
into 0 307 80
any 0 307 80
diocesan 0 307 80
seminary 0 307 80
without 0 307 80
being 0 307 80
a 0 307 80
property 0 307 80
owner. 0 307 80

He 0 307 81
should 0 307 81
own 0 307 81
a 0 307 81
house 0 307 81
or 0 307 81
stand 0 307 81
to 0 307 81
inherit 0 307 81
one. 0 307 81

Families 0 307 82
have 0 307 82
to 0 307 82
come 0 307 82
to 0 307 82
see 0 307 82
this 0 307 82
as 0 307 82
a 0 307 82
duty 0 307 82
to 0 307 82
the 0 307 82
child 0 307 82
and 0 307 82
to 0 307 82
the 0 307 82
Church. 0 307 82

And 0 307 83
more 0 307 83
than 0 307 83
that, 0 307 83
the 0 307 83
potential 0 307 83
priest 0 307 83
needs 0 307 83
to 0 307 83
have 0 307 83
job 0 307 83
skills 0 307 83
that 0 307 83
have 0 307 83
nothing 0 307 83
to 0 307 83
do 0 307 83
with 0 307 83
the 0 307 83
priesthood. 0 307 83

Among 0 307 84
the 0 307 84
working 0 307 84
classes 0 307 84
there 0 307 84
is 0 307 84
a 0 307 84
bias 0 307 84
against 0 307 84
intellectual 0 307 84
work. 0 307 84

But 0 307 85
most 0 307 85
working 0 307 85
class 0 307 85
people 0 307 85
have 0 307 85
a 0 307 85
pretty 0 307 85
sensible 0 307 85
attitude 0 307 85
towards 0 307 85
ambitions 0 307 85
in 0 307 85
academia: 0 307 85
get 0 307 85
something 0 307 85
under 0 307 85
your 0 307 85
belt 0 307 85
you 0 307 85
can 0 307 85
fall 0 307 85
back 0 307 85
on. 0 307 85

How 0 307 86
many 0 307 86
philosophy 0 307 86
PhDs 0 307 86
can 0 307 86
build 0 307 86
himself 0 307 86
a 0 307 86
bookshelf? 0 307 86

Change 0 307 87
the 0 307 87
oil 0 307 87
in 0 307 87
a 0 307 87
car? 0 307 87

Rewire 0 307 88
a 0 307 88
house? 0 307 88

The 0 307 89
standard 0 307 89
cliché 0 307 89
of 0 307 89
young 0 307 89
people 0 307 89
with 0 307 89
useless 0 307 89
academic 0 307 89
degrees 0 307 89
working 0 307 89
at 0 307 89
Starbucks 0 307 89
has 0 307 89
become 0 307 89
so 0 307 89
common 0 307 89
it’s 0 307 89
not 0 307 89
even 0 307 89
worth 0 307 89
memeing 0 307 89
anymore. 0 307 89

How 0 307 90
many 0 307 90
young 0 307 90
men 0 307 90
do 0 307 90
we 0 307 90
foresee 0 307 90
being 0 307 90
forced 0 307 90
out 0 307 90
of 0 307 90
seminary 0 307 90
for 0 307 90
having 0 307 90
the 0 307 90
wrong 0 307 90
“sexual 0 307 90
orientation”? 0 307 90

Every 0 307 91
one 0 307 91
of 0 307 91
those 0 307 91
guys 0 307 91
needs 0 307 91
to 0 307 91
be 0 307 91
able 0 307 91
to 0 307 91
snap 0 307 91
his 0 307 91
fingers 0 307 91
in 0 307 91
the 0 307 91
face 0 307 91
of 0 307 91
the 0 307 91
rector 0 307 91
and 0 307 91
walk 0 307 91
straight 0 307 91
into 0 307 91
a 0 307 91
decent 0 307 91
job, 0 307 91
based 0 307 91
not 0 307 91
on 0 307 91
any 0 307 91
recommendation 0 307 91
from 0 307 91
a 0 307 91
corrupt 0 307 91
bishop, 0 307 91
but 0 307 91
on 0 307 91
his 0 307 91
solid 0 307 91
skills. 0 307 91

Among 0 307 92
the 0 307 92
white 0 307 92
collar 0 307 92
classes 0 307 92
there 0 307 92
is 0 307 92
a 0 307 92
bias 0 307 92
against 0 307 92
blue 0 307 92
collar 0 307 92
work, 0 307 92
but 0 307 92
the 0 307 92
trades 0 307 92
are 0 307 92
crying 0 307 92
out 0 307 92
for 0 307 92
skilled 0 307 92
men 0 307 92
and 0 307 92
a 0 307 92
trade 0 307 92
school 0 307 92
diploma 0 307 92
in 0 307 92
fixing 0 307 92
tractors 0 307 92
is 0 307 92
a 0 307 92
lot 0 307 92
cheaper 0 307 92
and 0 307 92
a 0 307 92
lot 0 307 92
faster 0 307 92
to 0 307 92
get 0 307 92
than 0 307 92
a 0 307 92
university 0 307 92
degree. 0 307 92

That’s 0 307 93
an 0 307 93
economic 0 307 93
asset 0 307 93
that 0 307 93
we 0 307 93
can’t 0 307 93
afford 0 307 93
to 0 307 93
turn 0 307 93
up 0 307 93
our 0 307 93
well-educated 0 307 93

at. 0 307 93

It 0 307 95
reminds 0 307 95
me 0 307 95
of 0 307 95
a 0 307 95
discussion 0 307 95
I 0 307 95
had 0 307 95
some 0 307 95
years 0 307 95
ago 0 307 95
with 0 307 95
the 0 307 95
prior 0 307 95
of 0 307 95
a 0 307 95
Benedictine 0 307 95
monastery 0 307 95
that 0 307 95
is 0 307 95
attracting 0 307 95
a 0 307 95
lot 0 307 95
of 0 307 95
young 0 307 95
vocations. 0 307 95

One 0 307 96
kid 0 307 96
wanted 0 307 96
to 0 307 96
join 0 307 96
and 0 307 96
told 0 307 96
me 0 307 96
they 0 307 96
had 0 307 96
recommended 0 307 96
he 0 307 96
go 0 307 96
to 0 307 96
some 0 307 96
college 0 307 96
or 0 307 96
other 0 307 96
to 0 307 96
study 0 307 96
philosophy 0 307 96
first. 0 307 96

This 0 307 97
college, 0 307 97
apparently, 0 307 97
waives 0 307 97
much 0 307 97
of 0 307 97
the 0 307 97
tuition 0 307 97
and 0 307 97
gives 0 307 97
work 0 307 97
studies 0 307 97
to 0 307 97
people 0 307 97
going 0 307 97
for 0 307 97
the 0 307 97
priesthood 0 307 97
and 0 307 97
religious 0 307 97
life 0 307 97
so 0 307 97
they 0 307 97
can 0 307 97
avoid 0 307 97
the 0 307 97
student 0 307 97
loan 0 307 97
trap. 0 307 97

This 0 307 98
is 0 307 98
fine, 0 307 98
good 0 307 98
idea. 0 307 98

But 0 307 99
I 0 307 99
asked 0 307 99
him 0 307 99
what 0 307 99
he 0 307 99
knew 0 307 99
how 0 307 99
to 0 307 99
do. 0 307 99

“Can 0 307 100
you 0 307 100
fix 0 307 100
a 0 307 100
bathroom 0 307 100
pipe? 0 307 100

Do 0 307 101
you 0 307 101
know 0 307 101
anything 0 307 101
about 0 307 101
what 0 307 101
to 0 307 101
feed 0 307 101
a 0 307 101
sheep 0 307 101
or 0 307 101
how 0 307 101
to 0 307 101
care 0 307 101
for 0 307 101
a 0 307 101
cow? 0 307 101

Can 0 307 102
you 0 307 102
drive 0 307 102
a 0 307 102
tractor?” 0 307 102
This 0 307 102
nice 0 307 102
kid, 0 307 102
who 0 307 102
certainly 0 307 102
does 0 307 102
have 0 307 102
a 0 307 102
vocation, 0 307 102
could 0 307 102
read 0 307 102
books 0 307 102
and 0 307 102
look 0 307 102
things 0 307 102
up 0 307 102
on 0 307 102
the 0 307 102
internet 0 307 102
and 0 307 102
write 0 307 102
a 0 307 102
pretty 0 307 102
mean 0 307 102
paper 0 307 102
on 0 307 102
Thomas 0 307 102
Aquinas, 0 307 102
but 0 307 102
not 0 307 102
a 0 307 102
lot 0 307 102
else. 0 307 102

There 0 307 103
is 0 307 103
going 0 307 103
to 0 307 103
have 0 307 103
to 0 307 103
be 0 307 103
a 0 307 103
shift 0 307 103
in 0 307 103
attitude 0 307 103
in 0 307 103
our 0 307 103
remaining 0 307 103
faithful 0 307 103
institutions. 0 307 103

Does 0 307 104
a 0 307 104
monastery 0 307 104
really 0 307 104
need 0 307 104
all 0 307 104
of 0 307 104
its 0 307 104
members 0 307 104
to 0 307 104
have 0 307 104
PhDs 0 307 104
in 0 307 104
philosophy 0 307 104
and 0 307 104
theology? 0 307 104

Wouldn’t 0 307 105
it 0 307 105
also 0 307 105
be 0 307 105
useful 0 307 105
to 0 307 105
have 0 307 105
an 0 307 105
electrician, 0 307 105
a 0 307 105
plumber, 0 307 105
a 0 307 105
carpenter, 0 307 105
a 0 307 105
cook, 0 307 105
someone 0 307 105
who 0 307 105
knows 0 307 105
how 0 307 105
to 0 307 105
fix 0 307 105
a 0 307 105
car 0 307 105
or 0 307 105
a 0 307 105
tractor? 0 307 105

Or 0 307 106
for 0 307 106
that 0 307 106
matter, 0 307 106
a 0 307 106
certified 0 307 106
accountant 0 307 106
or 0 307 106
an 0 307 106
investment 0 307 106
banker? 0 307 106

If 0 307 107
you 0 307 107
insist 0 307 107
on 0 307 107
having 0 307 107
people 0 307 107
with 0 307 107
degrees, 0 307 107
maybe 0 307 107
a 0 307 107
degree 0 307 107
in 0 307 107
agriculture 0 307 107
would 0 307 107
be 0 307 107
a 0 307 107
good 0 307 107
fit 0 307 107
for 0 307 107
a 0 307 107
big 0 307 107
monastic 0 307 107
foundation 0 307 107
with 0 307 107
a 0 307 107
lot 0 307 107
of 0 307 107
land 0 307 107
like, 0 307 107
say, 0 307 107
Clear 0 307 107
Creek 0 307 107
or 0 307 107
that 0 307 107
new 0 307 107
Carmelite 0 307 107
place 0 307 107
in 0 307 107
Nebraska. 0 307 107

I 0 307 108
think 0 307 108
this 0 307 108
is 0 307 108
the 0 307 108
time 0 307 108
we 0 307 108
are 0 307 108
going 0 307 108
to 0 307 108
have 0 307 108
to 0 307 108
start 0 307 108
overcoming 0 307 108
our 0 307 108
class 0 307 108
snobbery. 0 307 108

Young 0 307 109
men 0 307 109
with 0 307 109
ambitions 0 307 109
for 0 307 109
the 0 307 109
priesthood 0 307 109
are 0 307 109
going 0 307 109
to 0 307 109
have 0 307 109
to 0 307 109
tuck 0 307 109
away 0 307 109
employability 0 307 109
and 0 307 109
an 0 307 109
independent 0 307 109
financial 0 307 109
foundation, 0 307 109
in 0 307 109
the 0 307 109
same 0 307 109
way 0 307 109
people 0 307 109
used 0 307 109
to 0 307 109
tuck 0 307 109
money 0 307 109
away 0 307 109
against 0 307 109
a 0 307 109
rainy 0 307 109
day. 0 307 109

Simply 0 307 110
put, 0 307 110
they’ve 0 307 110
got 0 307 110
to 0 307 110
stop 0 307 110
being 0 307 110
materially 0 307 110
dependent 0 307 110
on 0 307 110
the 0 307 110
hierarchy. 0 307 110

This 0 307 111
vulnerability 0 307 111
is 0 307 111
a 0 307 111
gun 0 307 111
to 0 307 111
their 0 307 111
heads 0 307 111
in 0 307 111
this 0 307 111
time. 0 307 111

The 0 307 112
next 0 307 112
kid 0 307 112
who 0 307 112
says 0 307 112
anything 0 307 112
to 0 307 112
me 0 307 112
about 0 307 112
wanting 0 307 112
to 0 307 112
enter 0 307 112
the 0 307 112
diocesan 0 307 112
priesthood, 0 307 112
I’m 0 307 112
going 0 307 112
to 0 307 112
ask, 0 307 112
“How 0 307 112
sound 0 307 112
is 0 307 112
your 0 307 112
investment 0 307 112
portfolio?” 0 307 112
The 0 307 112
next 0 307 112
candidate 0 307 112
for 0 307 112
religious 0 307 112
life, 0 307 112
I’ll 0 307 112
ask, 0 307 112
“Great! 0 307 112

What’s 0 307 113
your 0 307 113
trade? 0 307 113

What 0 307 114
do 0 307 114
you 0 307 114
have 0 307 114
to 0 307 114
fall 0 307 114
back 0 307 114
on?” 0 307 114

I’m 0 307 115
given 0 307 115
to 0 307 115
understand 0 307 115
that 0 307 115
some 0 307 115
houses 0 307 115
of 0 307 115
the 0 307 115
Congregation 0 307 115
of 0 307 115
the 0 307 115
Oratory 0 307 115
ask 0 307 115
candidates 0 307 115
to 0 307 115
come 0 307 115
with 0 307 115
an 0 307 115
independent 0 307 115
income, 0 307 115
which, 0 307 115
given 0 307 115
what 0 307 115
we’re 0 307 115
seeing 0 307 115
elsewhere 0 307 115
doesn’t 0 307 115
sound 0 307 115
like 0 307 115
a 0 307 115
bad 0 307 115
idea. 0 307 115

Perhaps 0 307 116
Catholic 0 307 116
financial 0 307 116
advisors 0 307 116
could 0 307 116
be 0 307 116
encouraged 0 307 116
to 0 307 116
set 0 307 116
up 0 307 116
a 0 307 116
programme 0 307 116
to 0 307 116
teach 0 307 116
young 0 307 116
men 0 307 116
how 0 307 116
to 0 307 116
create 0 307 116
a 0 307 116
sound 0 307 116
financial 0 307 116
footing 0 307 116
with 0 307 116
investments. 0 307 116

Meanwhile, 0 307 117
we 0 307 117
must 0 307 117
refocus 0 307 117
our 0 307 117
energy 0 307 117
on 0 307 117
the 0 307 117
Faith 0 307 117
itself, 0 307 117
instead 0 307 117
of 0 307 117
the 0 307 117
physical 0 307 117
and 0 307 117
even 0 307 117
canonical 0 307 117
structures 0 307 117
that 0 307 117
house 0 307 117
it. 0 307 117

That 0 307 118
monastery 0 307 118
in 0 307 118
Germany 0 307 118
is 0 307 118
lost. 0 307 118

Those 0 307 119
bishops 0 307 119
want 0 307 119
the 0 307 119
property 0 307 119
and 0 307 119
they’ll 0 307 119
get 0 307 119
it. 0 307 119

What 0 307 120
the 0 307 120
group 0 307 120
of 0 307 120
laymen 0 307 120
should 0 307 120
be 0 307 120
doing, 0 307 120
instead 0 307 120
of 0 307 120
petitioning 0 307 120
that 0 307 120
it 0 307 120
be 0 307 120
saved, 0 307 120
is 0 307 120
finding 0 307 120
a 0 307 120
place 0 307 120
where 0 307 120
the 0 307 120
nuns 0 307 120
can 0 307 120
live 0 307 120
their 0 307 120
charism 0 307 120
of 0 307 120
religious 0 307 120
life 0 307 120
without 0 307 120
episcopal 0 307 120
harassment. 0 307 120

Bishops 0 307 121
won’t 0 307 121
protect 0 307 121
and 0 307 121
support 0 307 121
good 0 307 121
priests? 0 307 121

Then 1 307 122
it’s 1 307 122
up 1 307 122
to 1 307 122
us. 1 307 122

The 0 307 123
Vatican 0 307 123
wants 0 307 123
to 0 307 123
force 0 307 123
all 0 307 123
religious 0 307 123
congregations 0 307 123
into 0 307 123
the 0 307 123
pants-wearing, 0 307 123
Marxist 0 307 123
anti-nun, 0 307 123
LCWR 0 307 123
pattern? 0 307 123

We’re 0 307 124
not 0 307 124
helpless. 0 307 124

We 0 307 125
start 0 307 125
buying 0 307 125
convent 0 307 125
buildings 0 307 125
and 0 307 125
start 0 307 125
a 0 307 125
fund 0 307 125
to 0 307 125
support 0 307 125
the 0 307 125
nun-refugees. 0 307 125

Our 0 307 126
goal 0 307 126
must 0 307 126
be 0 307 126
preserving 0 307 126
the 0 307 126
precious 0 307 126
treasure, 0 307 126
the 0 307 126
Deposit 0 307 126
of 0 307 126
the 0 307 126
Faith, 0 307 126
the 0 307 126
sacramental 0 307 126
life, 0 307 126
the 0 307 126
great 0 307 126
charisms 0 307 126
and 0 307 126
artifacts 0 307 126
of 0 307 126
the 0 307 126
religious 0 307 126
life. 0 307 126

I 0 307 127
am 0 307 127
reminded 0 307 127
of 0 307 127
what 0 307 127
the 0 307 127
curators 0 307 127
of 0 307 127
the 0 307 127
Hermitage 0 307 127
Museum 0 307 127
in 0 307 127
St. 0 307 127
Petersburg 0 307 127
did 0 307 127
in 0 307 127
the 0 307 127
face 0 307 127
of 0 307 127
the 0 307 127
advancing 0 307 127
German 0 307 127
army. 0 307 127

They 0 307 128
took 0 307 128
down, 0 307 128
packed 0 307 128
up 0 307 128
and 0 307 128
hid 0 307 128
the 0 307 128
art 0 307 128
treasures, 0 307 128
some 0 307 128
of 0 307 128
the 0 307 128
greatest 0 307 128
in 0 307 128
the 0 307 128
world. 0 307 128

Over 0 307 129
a 0 307 129
million 0 307 129
precious 0 307 129
works 0 307 129
of 0 307 129
art 0 307 129
were 0 307 129
sent 0 307 129
on 0 307 129
trains 0 307 129
to 0 307 129
be 0 307 129
hidden 0 307 129
in 0 307 129
the 0 307 129
Urals. 0 307 129

Two 0 307 130
trains 0 307 130
got 0 307 130
away 0 307 130
to 0 307 130
safety, 0 307 130
but 0 307 130
one 0 307 130
was 0 307 130
still 0 307 130
there 0 307 130
when 0 307 130
the 0 307 130
Germans 0 307 130
surrounded 0 307 130
the 0 307 130
city 0 307 130
and 0 307 130
began 0 307 130
the 0 307 130
siege. 0 307 130

The 0 307 131

us: 0 307 131

“Despite 0 307 132

To 0 307 137
keep 0 307 137
up 0 307 137
everyone’s 0 307 137
morale, 0 307 137
the 0 307 137
museum 0 307 137
staff, 0 307 137
while 0 307 137
bombs 0 307 137
were 0 307 137
falling 0 307 137
and 0 307 137
they 0 307 137
and 0 307 137
their 0 307 137
patrons 0 307 137
were 0 307 137

lectures, 0 307 137
describing 0 307 137
perfectly 0 307 137
the 0 307 137
artworks 0 307 137
that 0 307 137
had 0 307 137
been 0 307 137
removed. 0 307 137

They 0 307 138
understood 0 307 138
the 0 307 138
value 0 307 138
of 0 307 138
what 0 307 138
they 0 307 138
had, 0 307 138
and 0 307 138
did 0 307 138
everything 0 307 138

Does 0 307 139
this 0 307 139
all 0 307 139
sound 0 307 139
a 0 307 139
bit, 0 307 139
well, 0 307 139
schismatic? 0 307 139

Not 0 307 140
necessarily. 0 307 140

Any 0 307 141
bishop 0 307 141
who 0 307 141
can 0 307 141
demonstrate 0 307 141
through 0 307 141
his 0 307 141
actions 0 307 141
and 0 307 141
not 0 307 141
just 0 307 141
with 0 307 141
his 0 307 141
tweets, 0 307 141
who 0 307 141
can 0 307 141
prove 0 307 141
that 0 307 141
he 0 307 141
is 0 307 141
still 0 307 141
a 0 307 141
Catholic 0 307 141
and 0 307 141
not 0 307 141
a 0 307 141
wolf, 1 307 141
is 0 307 141
welcome 0 307 141
to 0 307 141
join 0 307 141
us. 0 307 141

But 0 307 142
we’d 0 307 142
be 0 307 142
fools 0 307 142
to 0 307 142
wait 0 307 142
for 0 307 142
them. 0 307 142

Whatever 0 307 143
you 0 307 143
might 0 307 143
think 0 307 143
of 0 307 143
Archbishop 0 307 143
Lefebvre’s 0 307 143
solution 0 307 143
over 0 307 143
the 0 307 143
last 0 307 143
few 0 307 143
decades, 0 307 143
it 0 307 143
certainly 0 307 143
seems 0 307 143
inarguable 0 307 143
that 0 307 143
the 0 307 143
“state 0 307 143
of 0 307 143
emergency” 0 307 143
for 0 307 143
which 0 307 143
he 0 307 143
was 0 307 143
preparing 0 307 143
has 0 307 143
come 0 307 143
at 0 307 143
last. 0 307 143

And 0 307 144
in 0 307 144
a 0 307 144
state 0 307 144
of 0 307 144
emergency, 0 307 144
certain 0 307 144
norms 0 307 144
are 0 307 144
naturally 0 307 144
suspended. 0 307 144

The 0 307 145
simple 0 307 145
fact 0 307 145
is 0 307 145
that 0 307 145
soon 0 307 145
there 0 307 145
are 0 307 145
going 0 307 145
to 0 307 145
be 0 307 145
“vagus” 0 307 145
priests 0 307 145
who 0 307 145
have 0 307 145
been 0 307 145
thrown 0 307 145
out 0 307 145
of 0 307 145
their 0 307 145
ministry 0 307 145
for 0 307 145
maintaining 0 307 145
the 0 307 145
Faith. 0 307 145

There 0 307 146
are 0 307 146
going 0 307 146
to 0 307 146
be 0 307 146
nuns 0 307 146
and 0 307 146
monks 0 307 146
without 0 307 146
homes, 0 307 146
as 0 307 146
in 0 307 146
the 0 307 146
England 0 307 146
of 0 307 146
Henry 0 307 146
VIII. 0 307 146

I 0 307 147
think 0 307 147
it’s 0 307 147
only 0 307 147
reasonable 0 307 147
that 0 307 147
those 0 307 147
who 0 307 147
also 0 307 147
want 0 307 147
to 0 307 147
maintain 0 307 147
the 0 307 147
Faith 0 307 147
should 0 307 147
reach 0 307 147
out 0 307 147
to 0 307 147
them 0 307 147
and 0 307 147
offer 0 307 147
what 0 307 147
shelter 0 307 147
we 0 307 147
can. 0 307 147

What 0 307 148
we 0 307 148
have 0 307 148
seen 0 307 148
this 0 307 148
week 0 307 148
is 0 307 148
making 0 307 148
it 0 307 148
clear 0 307 148
that 0 307 148
we 0 307 148
can 0 307 148
simply 0 307 148
no 0 307 148
longer 0 307 148
sit 0 307 148
back 0 307 148
and 0 307 148
“beg” 0 307 148
bishops 0 307 148
to 0 307 148
maintain 0 307 148
and 0 307 148
defend 0 307 148
the 0 307 148
Faith. 0 307 148

It’s 0 307 149
not 0 307 149
enough 0 307 149
now 0 307 149
to 0 307 149
go 0 307 149
into 0 307 149
seminary 0 307 149
or 0 307 149
a 0 307 149
monastery 0 307 149
with 0 307 149
glowing 0 307 149
eyes 0 307 149
and 0 307 149
a 0 307 149
firm 0 307 149
faith. 0 307 149

Sentiment 0 307 150
isn’t 0 307 150
going 0 307 150
to 0 307 150
be 0 307 150
much 0 307 150
comfort 0 307 150
when 0 307 150
the 0 307 150
young 0 307 150
man 0 307 150
is 0 307 150
no 0 307 150
longer 0 307 150
so 0 307 150
very 0 307 150
young 0 307 150
and 0 307 150
finds 0 307 150
himself 0 307 150
standing 0 307 150
on 0 307 150
the 0 307 150
street 0 307 150
outside 0 307 150
the 0 307 150
chancery 0 307 150
with 0 307 150
no 0 307 150
skills, 0 307 150
no 0 307 150
money, 0 307 150
no 0 307 150
job, 0 307 150
(no 0 307 150
health 0 307 150
insurance) 0 307 150
and 0 307 150
no 0 307 150
prospects. 0 307 150

If 0 307 151
it 0 307 151
is 0 307 151
true 0 307 151
that 0 307 151
we 0 307 151
really 0 307 151
are 0 307 151
alone 0 307 151
in 0 307 151
this, 0 307 151
then 1 307 151
so 1 307 151
be 1 307 151
it. 1 307 151

Let’s 0 307 152
stop 0 307 152
lamenting 0 307 152
and 0 307 152
start 0 307 152
doing 0 307 152
practical 0 307 152
things 0 307 152
about 0 307 152
it. 0 307 152

probably 0 307 155
be 0 307 155
noted 0 307 155

up 0 307 155

the 0 307 155

1966, 0 307 156
was 0 307 156

Ireland 0 307 156
until 0 307 156
1983. 0 307 156

This 0 307 157
period 0 307 157
was 0 307 157
at 0 307 157
the 0 307 157
peak 0 307 157
of 0 307 157
the 0 307 157

it 0 307 158
has 0 307 158
been 0 307 158
shown 0 307 158
ALL 0 307 158
the 0 307 158

The 0 307 159
Farrell 0 307 159

involvement 0 307 159
in 0 307 159
the 0 307 159
Legion 0 307 159
continues 0 307 159
with 0 307 159
his 0 307 159
brother, 0 307 159
Bishop 0 307 159
Brian 0 307 159
Farrell, 0 307 159

ordained 0 307 159
20 0 307 159

questionable-but-officially-reformed 0 307 159
community 0 307 159
in 0 307 159
2015. 0 307 159

A 0 307 160
recent 0 307 160
post 0 307 160
to 0 307 160
the 0 307 160
official 0 307 160
Regnum 0 307 160
Christi 0 307 160
website 0 307 160
shows 0 307 160
that 0 307 160
Cardinal 0 307 160
Kevin 0 307 160
is 0 307 160
still 0 307 160
close 0 307 160
enough 0 307 160
to 0 307 160
the 0 307 160
Legion-related 0 307 160
“lay” 0 307 160
organisation 0 307 160
to 0 307 160
hire 0 307 160
dicastery 0 307 160
staff 0 307 160
from 0 307 160
their 0 307 160
ranks. 0 307 160

After 0 307 161
he 0 307 161
left 0 307 161
the 0 307 161
Legion, 0 307 161
Kevin 0 307 161
Farrell 0 307 161
joined 0 307 161
the 0 307 161
diocesan 0 307 161
clergy 0 307 161
in 0 307 161
Washington 0 307 161
DC 0 307 161
and 0 307 161
became 0 307 161
a 0 307 161
protégé 0 307 161
of 0 307 161
the 0 307 161
archbishop, 0 307 161
Cardinal 0 307 161
Wuerl. 0 307 161

So 0 307 162
close 0 307 162
is 0 307 162
he 0 307 162
to 0 307 162
McCarrick 0 307 162
that 0 307 162
Farrell’s 0 307 162
coat 0 307 162
of 0 307 162
arms, 0 307 162
as 0 307 162
Elizabeth 0 307 162
Yore 0 307 162
reported 0 307 162
in 0 307 162
these 0 307 162
pages, 0 307 162
is 0 307 162
not 0 307 162
much 0 307 162
more 0 307 162
than 0 307 162
a 0 307 162
tribute 0 307 162
to 0 307 162
his 0 307 162
belatedly-disgraced 0 307 162
mentor. 0 307 162

So, 0 307 163
someone 0 307 163
in 0 307 163
a 0 307 163
journalistic 0 307 163
capacity 0 307 163
might 0 307 163
want 0 307 163
to 0 307 163
be 0 307 163
asking 0 307 163
a 0 307 163
few 0 307 163
questions 0 307 163
about 0 307 163
these 0 307 163
things 0 307 163
too. 0 307 163

[2] 0 307 164
It 0 307 164
should 0 307 164
also 0 307 164
be 0 307 164
noted 0 307 164
that 0 307 164
in 0 307 164
his 0 307 164
book, 0 307 164
The 0 307 164
Dictator 0 307 164
Pope, 0 307 164
historian 0 307 164
Henry 0 307 164
Sire 0 307 164
documented 0 307 164
that 0 307 164
this 0 307 164
is 0 307 164
how 0 307 164
Jorge 0 307 164
Bergoglio 0 307 164
has 0 307 164
always 0 307 164
operated, 0 307 164
collecting 0 307 164
bad 0 307 164
men 0 307 164
around 0 307 164
him 0 307 164
and 0 307 164
controlling 0 307 164
them 0 307 164
with 0 307 164
a 0 307 164
masterful 0 307 164
combination 0 307 164
of 0 307 164
threats 0 307 164
and 0 307 164
rewards. 0 307 164

The 0 307 165
natural 0 307 165
question, 0 307 165
“Why 0 307 165
does 0 307 165
Pope 0 307 165
Francis 0 307 165
keep 0 307 165
such 0 307 165
bad 0 307 165
men 0 307 165
around 0 307 165
him?” 0 307 165
is 0 307 165
now 0 307 165
easy 0 307 165
to 0 307 165
answer. 0 307 165

We 0 310 0
Should 0 310 0
Be 0 310 0
More 0 310 0
Like 0 310 0
Sweden: 0 310 0
Gov 0 310 0
May 0 310 0
Use 0 310 0
Army 0 310 0
Against 0 310 0
Immigrant 0 310 0
Gangs 0 310 0

Progressives 0 310 1
say 0 310 1
we 0 310 1
should 0 310 1
be 0 310 1
more 0 310 1
like 0 310 1
Sweden. 0 310 1

That 0 310 2
means 0 310 2
turning 0 310 2
our 0 310 2
country 0 310 2
into 0 310 2
a 1 310 2
hopeless 1 310 2
hellhole 1 310 2
where 1 310 2
the 1 310 2
native 1 310 2
population 1 310 2
is 1 310 2
overtaxed 1 310 2
and 1 310 2
terrorized 1 310 2
by 1 310 2
warring 1 310 2
foreign 1 310 2
gangs. 1 310 2

We're 0 310 3
getting 0 310 3
there 0 310 3
too. 0 310 3

What 0 310 4
should 0 310 4
we 0 310 4
do? 0 310 4

Maybe 0 310 5
we 0 310 5
should 0 310 5
be 0 310 5
more 0 310 5
like 0 310 5
Sweden? 0 310 5

Sweden 0 310 6
will 0 310 6
do 0 310 6
whatever 0 310 6
it 0 310 6
takes, 0 310 6
including 0 310 6
sending 0 310 6
in 0 310 6
the 0 310 6
army, 0 310 6
to 0 310 6
end 0 310 6
a 0 310 6
wave 0 310 6
of 0 310 6
gang 0 310 6
violence 0 310 6
that 0 310 6
has 0 310 6
seen 0 310 6
a 0 310 6
string 0 310 6
of 0 310 6
deadly 0 310 6
shootings, 0 310 6
Prime 0 310 6
Minister 0 310 6
Stefan 0 310 6
Lofven 0 310 6
said 0 310 6
in 0 310 6
Wednesday. 0 310 6

Sweden's 0 310 7
murder 0 310 7
rate 0 310 7
is 0 310 7
relatively 0 310 7
low 0 310 7
in 0 310 7
international 0 310 7
terms, 0 310 7
but 0 310 7
gang 0 310 7
violence 0 310 7
has 0 310 7
surged 0 310 7
in 0 310 7
recent 0 310 7
years 0 310 7
and 0 310 7
Swedes 0 310 7
are 0 310 7
worried 0 310 7
that 0 310 7
the 0 310 7
police 0 310 7
are 0 310 7
unable 0 310 7
to 0 310 7
cope. 0 310 7

Of 1 310 8
course 1 310 8
they 1 310 8
can't 1 310 8
cope. 1 310 8

It's 0 310 9
Demolition 1 310 9
Man 1 310 9
in 0 310 9
real 0 310 9
life 0 310 9

raise 0 310 9
their 0 310 9
voices. 0 310 9

Four 0 310 10
people 0 310 10
were 0 310 10
shot 0 310 10
dead 0 310 10
in 0 310 10
the 0 310 10
first 0 310 10
week 0 310 10
of 0 310 10
this 0 310 10
year. 0 310 10

One 0 310 11
man 0 310 11
died 0 310 11
after 0 310 11
picking 0 310 11
up 0 310 11
a 0 310 11

Stockholm. 0 310 11

Law 0 310 12
and 0 310 12
order 0 310 12
is 0 310 12
likely 0 310 12
to 0 310 12

"It 0 310 13
would 0 310 13
not 0 310 13

I 0 310 13
am 0 310 13

Bringing 0 310 14
in 0 310 14
the 0 310 14
military 0 310 14
comes 0 310 14
in 0 310 14
as 0 310 14
an 0 310 14
option 0 310 14
ahead 0 310 14
of 0 310 14
cutting 0 310 14
migration 0 310 14
to 0 310 14
Sweden. 1 310 14

That 1 310 15
tells 1 310 15
you 1 310 15
everything. 1 310 15

Why 0 310 16
would 0 310 16
anyone 0 310 16
associate 0 310 16
rising 0 310 16

Maybe 0 310 17
because 0 310 17
the 0 310 17
gangs 0 310 17
in 0 310 17
question 0 310 17
are 0 310 17
immigrant 0 310 17
gangs. 0 310 17

The 0 310 18
government 0 310 18
has 0 310 18
promised 0 310 18
police 0 310 18
an 0 310 18
extra 0 310 18
7.1 0 310 18
billion 0 310 18
crowns 0 310 18
($880 0 310 18
million) 0 310 18
through 0 310 18
2020, 0 310 18
toughened 0 310 18
laws 0 310 18
on 0 310 18
gun 0 310 18
crimes 0 310 18
and 0 310 18
made 0 310 18
it 0 310 18
easier 0 310 18
for 0 310 18
the 0 310 18
police 0 310 18
to 0 310 18
monitor 0 310 18
private 0 310 18
phone 0 310 18
calls 0 310 18
and 0 310 18
emails, 0 310 18
among 0 310 18
other 0 310 18
measures. 0 310 18

Sound 0 310 19
familiar? 0 310 19

Mass 1 310 20
repression 1 310 20
and 1 310 20
police 1 310 20
powers 1 310 20
that 1 310 20
don't 1 310 20
actually 1 310 20
address 1 310 20
the 1 310 20
cause 1 310 20
of 1 310 20
the 1 310 20
problem. 1 310 20

Meanwhile 0 310 21
the 0 310 21
Grenade 0 310 21
Amnesty 0 310 21
doesn't 0 310 21
seem 0 310 21
to 0 310 21
have 0 310 21
worked. 0 310 21

And 0 310 22
the 0 310 22
gang 0 310 22
violence 0 310 22
keeps 0 310 22
rising. 0 310 22

But 0 310 23
who 0 310 23
are 0 310 23
these 0 310 23
gangs? 0 310 23

The 0 310 24
criminal 0 310 24
gang 0 310 24
Loyal 0 310 24
to 0 310 24
Familia 0 310 24
has 0 310 24
already 0 310 24
spread 0 310 24
across 0 310 24
Denmark 0 310 24
from 0 310 24
its 0 310 24
base 0 310 24
in 0 310 24
the 0 310 24
Nørrebro 0 310 24
district 0 310 24
of 0 310 24
Copenhagen 0 310 24
and 0 310 24
now 0 310 24
it 0 310 24
appears 0 310 24
to 0 310 24
have 0 310 24
set 0 310 24
its 0 310 24
sights 0 310 24
on 0 310 24
Sweden. 0 310 24

Swedish 0 310 25
police 0 310 25
told 0 310 25
the 0 310 25
Danish 0 310 25
tabloid 0 310 25
Ekstra 0 310 25
Bladet 0 310 25
that 0 310 25
the 0 310 25
gang 0 310 25
is 0 310 25
trying 0 310 25
to 0 310 25
build 0 310 25
a 0 310 25
presence 0 310 25
in 0 310 25
both 0 310 25
Malmö 0 310 25
and 0 310 25
Helsingborg. 0 310 25

An 0 310 26
expansion 0 310 26
into 0 310 26
Malmö 0 310 26
could 0 310 26
be 0 310 26
a 0 310 26
recipe 0 310 26
for 0 310 26
increased 0 310 26
violence 0 310 26
in 0 310 26
light 0 310 26
of 0 310 26
the 0 310 26
fact 0 310 26
that 0 310 26
gun 0 310 26
violence 0 310 26
claimed 0 310 26
the 0 310 26
lives 0 310 26
of 0 310 26
11 0 310 26
people 0 310 26
in 0 310 26
the 0 310 26
southern 0 310 26
Swedish 0 310 26
city 0 310 26
last 0 310 26
year. 0 310 26

The 0 310 27
gang's 0 310 27
leader, 0 310 27
Shuaib 0 310 27
Khan, 0 310 27
confirmed 0 310 27
that 0 310 27
the 0 310 27
group 0 310 27
is 0 310 27
eyeing 0 310 27
the 0 310 27
two 0 310 27
Swedish 0 310 27
cities 0 310 27
but 0 310 27
denied 0 310 27
that 0 310 27
Loyal 0 310 27
to 0 310 27
Familia 0 310 27
was 0 310 27
a 0 310 27
“criminal 0 310 27
gang”. 0 310 27

Just 0 310 28
one 0 310 28
of 0 310 28
those 0 310 28
Danish 0 310 28

responsibility. 0 311 2

I 0 311 3
am 0 311 3
thinking 0 311 3
in 0 311 3

of 0 311 4
the 0 311 4
United 0 311 4

are 0 311 4
called, 0 311 4
and 0 311 4
I 0 311 4
with 0 311 4
them, 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
follow 0 311 4
the 0 311 4
example 0 311 4
of 0 311 4
these 0 311 4
first 0 311 4
martyrs 0 311 4
who 0 311 4
brought 0 311 4
the 0 311 4
Gospel 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
the 0 311 4
lands 0 311 4
of 0 311 4
America, 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
be 0 311 4

Also, 0 311 5
as 0 311 5
this 0 311 5
is 0 311 5
an 0 311 5
unprecedented 0 311 5
moment 0 311 5
in 0 311 5
papal 0 311 5
history, 0 311 5
perhaps 0 311 5
the 0 311 5
unprecedented 0 311 5
step 0 311 5
of 0 311 5
recalling 0 311 5
Benedict 0 311 5

the 0 311 5
Chair 0 311 5
of 0 311 5
St. 0 311 5
Peter 0 311 5
should 0 311 5
also 0 311 5
be 0 311 5
considered 0 311 5
sooner 0 311 5
rather 0 311 5
than 0 311 5
later, 0 311 5
before 1 311 5
this 1 311 5
crisis 1 311 5
gets 1 311 5
any 1 311 5
more 1 311 5
out-of-control 1 311 5
than 1 311 5
it 1 311 5
already 1 311 5
is. 1 311 5

God 0 311 6
save 0 311 6
His 0 311 6
Church 0 311 6
MJM 0 311 6

So 0 311 7
serious 0 311 7
is 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
cover-up 0 311 7
that 0 311 7
for 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
good 0 311 7
of 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
Church 0 311 7
and 0 311 7

of 0 311 7
the 0 311 7

Archbishop 0 311 7
Vigano 0 311 7
has 0 311 7
called 0 311 7
on 0 311 7
Pope 0 311 7
Francis 0 311 7
to 0 311 7
resign. 0 311 7

But 0 311 8
before 0 311 8
Francis 0 311 8
resigns, 0 311 8
we 0 311 8
the 0 311 8
Catholic 0 311 8
faithful 0 311 8
demand 0 311 8
that 0 311 8
he 0 311 8
also 0 311 8
remove 0 311 8
from 0 311 8
the 0 311 8
College 0 311 8
of 0 311 8
Cardinals 0 311 8
those 0 311 8
who 0 311 8
conspired 0 311 8
even 0 311 8
before 0 311 8
the 0 311 8

and 0 311 9
the 0 311 9

it 0 311 10
came 0 311 10
to 0 311 10
American 0 311 10
appointments 0 311 10

Note: 0 311 11
This 0 311 11
could 0 311 11
well 0 311 11
mark 0 311 11
the 0 311 11
beginning 0 311 11
of 0 311 11
the 0 311 11
end 0 311 11
of 0 311 11
the 0 311 11
disastrous 1 311 11
pontificate 0 311 11
of 0 311 11

to 0 311 12
the 0 311 12

repealing 0 311 12

McCarrick 0 311 12
for 0 311 12
sexual 0 311 12
abuse. 0 311 12

This 0 311 13
is 0 311 13
a 0 311 13
charge 0 311 13
most 1 311 13
serious, 1 311 13
perhaps 0 311 13
without 0 311 13
precedent 0 311 13
in 0 311 13
modern 0 311 13
times. 0 311 13

Bishops 0 311 14
and 0 311 14
priests, 0 311 14
abusing 0 311 14
their 0 311 14
authority, 0 311 14
have 0 311 14
committed 0 311 14
horrendous 1 311 14
crimes 0 311 14
to 0 311 14
the 0 311 14
detriment 0 311 14
of 0 311 14
their 0 311 14
faithful, 0 311 14
minors, 0 311 14
innocent 0 311 14

to 0 311 14
offer 0 311 14
their 0 311 14
lives 0 311 14
to 0 311 14
the 0 311 14
Church, 0 311 14
or 0 311 14
by 0 311 14
their 0 311 14
silence 0 311 14
have 0 311 14
not 0 311 14
prevented 0 311 14
that 0 311 14
such 0 311 14
crimes 0 311 14
continue 0 311 14
to 0 311 14
be 0 311 14
perpetrated. 0 311 14

To 0 311 15
restore 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
beauty 0 311 15
of 0 311 15
holiness 0 311 15
to 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
face 0 311 15
of 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
Bride 0 311 15
of 0 311 15
Christ, 0 311 15
which 0 311 15
is 0 311 15
terribly 1 311 15
disfigured 1 311 15
by 0 311 15
so 0 311 15
many 0 311 15
abominable 1 311 15
crimes, 1 311 15
and 0 311 15
if 0 311 15
we 0 311 15
truly 0 311 15
want 0 311 15
to 0 311 15
free 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
Church 0 311 15
from 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
fetid 0 311 15
swamp 0 311 15
into 0 311 15
which 0 311 15
she 0 311 15
has 0 311 15
fallen, 0 311 15
we 0 311 15
must 0 311 15
have 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
courage 0 311 15
to 0 311 15
tear 0 311 15
down 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
culture 0 311 15
of 0 311 15
secrecy 0 311 15
and 0 311 15
publicly 0 311 15
confess 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
truths 0 311 15
we 0 311 15
have 0 311 15
kept 0 311 15

We 1 311 16
must 1 311 16
tear 0 311 16
down 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
conspiracy 0 311 16
of 0 311 16
silence 0 311 16
with 0 311 16
which 0 311 16
bishops 0 311 16
and 0 311 16
priests 0 311 16
have 0 311 16
protected 0 311 16
themselves 0 311 16
at 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
expense 0 311 16
of 0 311 16
their 0 311 16
faithful, 0 311 16
a 0 311 16
conspiracy 0 311 16
of 0 311 16
silence 0 311 16
that 0 311 16
in 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
eyes 0 311 16
of 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
world 0 311 16
risks 0 311 16
making 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
Church 0 311 16
look 0 311 16
like 0 311 16
a 0 311 16
sect, 0 311 16
a 0 311 16
conspiracy 0 311 16
of 0 311 16
silence 0 311 16
not 0 311 16
so 0 311 16
dissimilar 0 311 16
from 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
one 0 311 16
that 0 311 16
prevails 0 311 16
in 0 311 16

“Whatever 0 311 17
you 0 311 17
have 0 311 17
said 0 311 17
in 0 311 17
the 0 311 17
dark 0 311 17
... 0 311 17
shall 0 311 17
be 0 311 17
proclaimed 0 311 17
from 0 311 17
the 0 311 17
housetops” 0 311 17
(Lk. 0 311 17

12:3). 0 311 18

I 0 311 19
had 0 311 19
always 0 311 19
believed 0 311 19
and 0 311 19
hoped 0 311 19
that 0 311 19
the 0 311 19
hierarchy 0 311 19
of 0 311 19
the 0 311 19
Church 0 311 19
could 0 311 19
find 0 311 19
within 0 311 19
itself 0 311 19
the 0 311 19
spiritual 0 311 19
resources 0 311 19
and 0 311 19
strength 0 311 19
to 0 311 19
tell 0 311 19
the 0 311 19
whole 0 311 19
truth, 0 311 19
to 0 311 19
amend 0 311 19
and 0 311 19
to 0 311 19
renew 0 311 19
itself. 0 311 19

That 0 311 20
is 0 311 20
why, 0 311 20
even 0 311 20
though 0 311 20
I 0 311 20
had 0 311 20
repeatedly 0 311 20
been 0 311 20
asked 0 311 20
to 0 311 20
do 0 311 20
so, 0 311 20
I 0 311 20
always 0 311 20
avoided 0 311 20
making 0 311 20
statements 0 311 20
to 0 311 20
the 0 311 20
media, 0 311 20
even 0 311 20
when 0 311 20
it 0 311 20
would 0 311 20
have 0 311 20
been 0 311 20
my 0 311 20
right 0 311 20
to 0 311 20
do 0 311 20
so, 0 311 20
in 0 311 20
order 0 311 20
to 0 311 20
defend 0 311 20
myself 0 311 20
against 0 311 20
the 0 311 20
calumnies 0 311 20
published 0 311 20
about 0 311 20
me, 0 311 20
even 0 311 20
by 0 311 20
high-ranking 0 311 20
prelates 0 311 20
of 0 311 20
the 0 311 20
Roman 0 311 20
Curia. 0 311 20

But 0 311 21
now 0 311 21
that 0 311 21
the 0 311 21
corruption 0 311 21
has 0 311 21
reached 0 311 21
the 0 311 21
very 0 311 21
top 0 311 21
of 0 311 21
the 0 311 21
Church’s 0 311 21
hierarchy, 0 311 21
my 0 311 21
conscience 0 311 21
dictates 0 311 21
that 0 311 21
I 0 311 21
reveal 0 311 21
those 0 311 21
truths 0 311 21
regarding 0 311 21

To 0 311 24
dispel 0 311 24
suspicions 0 311 24
insinuated 0 311 24
in 0 311 24
several 0 311 24
recent 0 311 24

I 0 311 24
will 0 311 24
immediately 0 311 24
say 0 311 24
that 0 311 24
the 0 311 24
Apostolic 0 311 24

Pietro 0 311 24
Sambi, 0 311 24
both 0 311 24
prematurely 0 311 24
deceased, 0 311 24
did 0 311 24
not 0 311 24
fail 0 311 24
to 0 311 24
inform 0 311 24
the 0 311 24
Holy 0 311 24
See 0 311 24
immediately, 0 311 24
as 0 311 24
soon 0 311 24
as 0 311 24
they 0 311 24
learned 0 311 24
of 0 311 24
Archbishop 0 311 24

Indeed, 0 311 25
according 0 311 25
to 0 311 25
what 0 311 25
Nuncio 0 311 25

In 0 311 26
the 0 311 26

Father 0 311 26
Ramsey, 0 311 26
who 0 311 26
had 0 311 26
been 0 311 26
a 0 311 26
professor 0 311 26
at 0 311 26
the 0 311 26
diocesan 0 311 26
seminary 0 311 26
in 0 311 26
Newark 0 311 26
from 0 311 26
the 0 311 26

of 0 311 26
the 0 311 26
’80s 0 311 26
until 0 311 26
1996, 0 311 26
affirms 0 311 26
that 0 311 26
there 0 311 26
was 0 311 26
a 0 311 26
recurring 0 311 26
rumor 0 311 26
in 0 311 26
the 0 311 26
seminary 0 311 26
that 0 311 26
the 0 311 26
Archbishop 0 311 26
“shared 0 311 26
his 0 311 26
bed 0 311 26
with 0 311 26
seminarians,” 0 311 26
inviting 0 311 26
five 0 311 26
at 0 311 26
a 0 311 26
time 0 311 26
to 0 311 26

the 0 311 26
weekend 0 311 26
with 0 311 26
him 0 311 26
at 0 311 26
his 0 311 26
beach 0 311 26
house. 0 311 26

And 0 311 27
he 0 311 27
added 0 311 27
that 0 311 27
he 0 311 27
knew 0 311 27
a 0 311 27
certain 0 311 27
number 0 311 27
of 0 311 27
seminarians, 0 311 27
some 0 311 27
of 0 311 27
whom 0 311 27
were 0 311 27
later 0 311 27
ordained 0 311 27
priests 0 311 27
for 0 311 27
the 0 311 27
Archdiocese 0 311 27
of 0 311 27
Newark, 0 311 27
who 0 311 27
had 0 311 27
been 0 311 27
invited 0 311 27
to 0 311 27
this 0 311 27
beach 0 311 27
house 0 311 27
and 0 311 27
had 0 311 27
shared 0 311 27
a 0 311 27
bed 0 311 27
with 0 311 27
the 0 311 27
Archbishop. 0 311 27

The 0 311 28
office 0 311 28
that 0 311 28
I 0 311 28
held 0 311 28
at 0 311 28
the 0 311 28
time 0 311 28
was 0 311 28
not 0 311 28
informed 0 311 28
of 0 311 28
any 0 311 28
measure 0 311 28
taken 0 311 28
by 0 311 28
the 0 311 28
Holy 0 311 28
See 0 311 28
after 0 311 28
those 0 311 28
charges 0 311 28
were 0 311 28
brought 0 311 28
by 0 311 28
Nuncio 0 311 28
Montalvo 0 311 28
at 0 311 28
the 0 311 28
end 0 311 28
of 0 311 28
2000, 0 311 28
when 0 311 28
Cardinal 0 311 28
Angelo 0 311 28
Sodano 0 311 28
was 0 311 28
Secretary 0 311 28
of 0 311 28
State. 0 311 28

Likewise, 0 311 29
Nuncio 0 311 29
Sambi 0 311 29
transmitted 0 311 29
to 0 311 29
the 0 311 29
Cardinal 0 311 29
Secretary 0 311 29
of 0 311 29
State, 0 311 29
Tarcisio 0 311 29
Bertone, 0 311 29
an 0 311 29
Indictment 0 311 29
Memorandum 0 311 29
against 0 311 29
McCarrick 0 311 29
by 0 311 29
the 0 311 29
priest 0 311 29
Gregory 0 311 29
Littleton 0 311 29
of 0 311 29
the 0 311 29
diocese 0 311 29
of 0 311 29
Charlotte, 0 311 29
who 0 311 29
was 0 311 29
reduced 0 311 29
to 0 311 29
the 0 311 29
lay 0 311 29
state 0 311 29
for 0 311 29
a 0 311 29
violation 0 311 29
of 0 311 29
minors, 0 311 29
together 0 311 29
with 0 311 29
two 0 311 29
documents 0 311 29
from 0 311 29
the 0 311 29
same 0 311 29
Littleton, 0 311 29
in 0 311 29
which 0 311 29
he 0 311 29
recounted 0 311 29
his 0 311 29
tragic 1 311 29
story 0 311 29
of 0 311 29
sexual 0 311 29
abuse 0 311 29
by 0 311 29
the 0 311 29
then-Archbishop 0 311 29
of 0 311 29
Newark 0 311 29
and 0 311 29
several 0 311 29
other 0 311 29
priests 0 311 29
and 0 311 29
seminarians. 0 311 29

The 0 311 30
Nuncio 0 311 30
added 0 311 30
that 0 311 30
Littleton 0 311 30
had 0 311 30
already 0 311 30
forwarded 0 311 30
his 0 311 30
Memorandum 0 311 30
to 0 311 30
about 0 311 30
twenty 0 311 30
people, 0 311 30
including 0 311 30
civil 0 311 30
and 0 311 30
ecclesiastical 0 311 30
judicial 0 311 30
authorities, 0 311 30
police 0 311 30
and 0 311 30
lawyers, 0 311 30
in 0 311 30
June 0 311 30
2006, 0 311 30
and 0 311 30
that 0 311 30
it 0 311 30
was 0 311 30
therefore 0 311 30
very 0 311 30
likely 0 311 30
that 0 311 30
the 0 311 30
news 0 311 30
would 0 311 30
soon 0 311 30
be 0 311 30
made 0 311 30
public. 0 311 30

He 0 311 31
therefore 0 311 31
called 0 311 31
for 0 311 31
a 0 311 31
prompt 0 311 31
intervention 0 311 31
by 0 311 31
the 0 311 31
Holy 0 311 31
See. 0 311 31

In 0 311 32

up 0 311 32
a 0 311 32
memo[1] 0 311 32
on 0 311 32
these 0 311 32

that 0 311 32

to 0 311 32
me, 0 311 32
as 0 311 32

In 0 311 33
my 0 311 33
memo, 0 311 33
which 0 311 33
I 0 311 33
delivered 0 311 33

course 0 311 33

- 0 311 34
Given 0 311 34
that 0 311 34
it 0 311 34
seemed 0 311 34
a 0 311 34
new 0 311 34
scandal 0 311 34
of 0 311 34
particular 0 311 34
gravity, 0 311 34
as 0 311 34
it 0 311 34
regarded 0 311 34
a 0 311 34
cardinal, 0 311 34
was 0 311 34
going 0 311 34

added 0 311 34
to 0 311 34
the 0 311 34
many 0 311 34
scandals 0 311 34
for 0 311 34
the 0 311 34
Church 0 311 34

- 0 311 35
and 0 311 35
that, 0 311 35
since 0 311 35
this 0 311 35
matter 0 311 35
had 0 311 35
to 0 311 35
do 0 311 35
with 0 311 35
a 0 311 35
cardinal, 0 311 35
and 0 311 35
according 0 311 35

- 0 311 38
I 0 311 38
proposed 0 311 38
that 0 311 38
an 0 311 38
exemplary 0 311 38
measure 0 311 38
be 0 311 38
taken 0 311 38
against 0 311 38
the 0 311 38
Cardinal 0 311 38
that 0 311 38
could 0 311 38
have 0 311 38
a 0 311 38
medicinal 0 311 38
function, 0 311 38
to 0 311 38
prevent 0 311 38
future 0 311 38
abuses 0 311 38
against 0 311 38
innocent 0 311 38
victims 0 311 38
and 0 311 38
alleviate 0 311 38
the 0 311 38
very 0 311 38
serious 0 311 38
scandal 0 311 38
for 0 311 38
the 0 311 38
faithful, 0 311 38
who 0 311 38
despite 0 311 38
everything 0 311 38
continued 0 311 38
to 0 311 38
love 0 311 38
and 0 311 38
believe 0 311 38
in 0 311 38
the 0 311 38
Church. 0 311 38

I 0 311 39
added 0 311 39
that 0 311 39
it 0 311 39
would 0 311 39
be 0 311 39
salutary 0 311 39
if, 0 311 39
for 0 311 39
once, 0 311 39
ecclesiastical 0 311 39
authority 0 311 39
would 0 311 39
intervene 0 311 39
before 0 311 39
the 0 311 39
civil 0 311 39
authorities 0 311 39
and, 0 311 39
if 0 311 39
possible, 0 311 39
before 0 311 39
the 0 311 39
scandal 0 311 39
had 0 311 39
broken 0 311 39
out 0 311 39
in 0 311 39
the 0 311 39
press. 0 311 39

This 0 311 40
could 0 311 40
have 0 311 40
restored 0 311 40
some 0 311 40
dignity 0 311 40
to 0 311 40
a 0 311 40
Church 0 311 40
so 0 311 40
sorely 0 311 40
tried 0 311 40
and 0 311 40
humiliated 0 311 40
by 0 311 40
so 0 311 40
many 0 311 40
abominable 0 311 40
acts 0 311 40
on 0 311 40
the 0 311 40
part 0 311 40
of 0 311 40
some 0 311 40
pastors. 0 311 40

If 0 311 41
this 0 311 41
were 0 311 41
done, 0 311 41
the 0 311 41
civil 0 311 41
authority 0 311 41
would 0 311 41
no 0 311 41
longer 0 311 41
have 0 311 41
to 0 311 41
judge 0 311 41
a 0 311 41
cardinal, 0 311 41
but 0 311 41
a 0 311 41
pastor 0 311 41
with 0 311 41
whom 0 311 41
the 0 311 41
Church 0 311 41
had 0 311 41
already 0 311 41
taken 0 311 41
appropriate 0 311 41
measures 0 311 41
to 0 311 41
prevent 0 311 41
the 0 311 41
cardinal 0 311 41
from 0 311 41
abusing 0 311 41
his 0 311 41
authority 0 311 41
and 0 311 41
continuing 0 311 41
to 0 311 41
destroy 1 311 41
innocent 0 311 41
victims. 0 311 41

My 0 311 42
memo 0 311 42
of 0 311 42
December 0 311 42
6, 0 311 42
2006 0 311 42
was 0 311 42
kept 0 311 42
by 0 311 42
my 0 311 42
superiors, 0 311 42
and 0 311 42
was 0 311 42
never 0 311 42
returned 0 311 42
to 0 311 42
me 0 311 42
with 0 311 42
any 0 311 42
actual 0 311 42
decision 0 311 42
by 0 311 42
the 0 311 42

this 0 311 42

On 0 311 44
April 0 311 44
24, 0 311 44
it 0 311 44
was 0 311 44
passed 0 311 44
on 0 311 44

on 0 311 45
May 0 311 45

2008. 0 311 45

The 0 311 46
following 0 311 46
day, 0 311 46
I 0 311 46
delivered 0 311 46
a 0 311 46
new 0 311 46
memo 0 311 46
to 0 311 46
the 0 311 46
new 0 311 46
Substitute, 0 311 46
Fernando 0 311 46
Filoni, 0 311 46
which 0 311 46
included 0 311 46
my 0 311 46
previous 0 311 46
one 0 311 46
of 0 311 46
December 0 311 46
6, 0 311 46
2006. 0 311 46

In 0 311 47
it, 0 311 47
I 0 311 47
summarized 0 311 47
Richard 0 311 47
Sipe’s 0 311 47
document, 0 311 47
which 0 311 47
ended 0 311 47
with 0 311 47
this 0 311 47
respectful 0 311 47
and 0 311 47
heartfelt 0 311 47
appeal 0 311 47
to 0 311 47
Pope 0 311 47
Benedict 0 311 47
XVI: 0 311 47
“I 0 311 47
approach 0 311 47
Your 0 311 47
Holiness 0 311 47
with 0 311 47
due 0 311 47
reverence, 0 311 47
but 0 311 47
with 0 311 47
the 0 311 47
same 0 311 47
intensity 0 311 47
that 0 311 47
motivated 0 311 47
Peter 0 311 47
Damian 0 311 47
to 0 311 47
lay 0 311 47
out 0 311 47
before 0 311 47
your 0 311 47
predecessor, 0 311 47
Pope 0 311 47
Leo 0 311 47
IX, 0 311 47
a 0 311 47
description 0 311 47
of 0 311 47
the 0 311 47
condition 0 311 47
of 0 311 47
the 0 311 47
clergy 0 311 47
during 0 311 47
his 0 311 47
time. 0 311 47

The 0 311 48
problems 0 311 48
he 0 311 48
spoke 0 311 48
of 0 311 48
are 0 311 48
similar 0 311 48
and 0 311 48
as 0 311 48
great 0 311 48
now 0 311 48
in 0 311 48
the 0 311 48
United 0 311 48
States 0 311 48
as 0 311 48
they 0 311 48
were 0 311 48
then 0 311 48
in 0 311 48
Rome. 0 311 48

If 0 311 49
Your 0 311 49
Holiness 0 311 49
requests, 0 311 49
I 0 311 49
will 0 311 49
personally 0 311 49
submit 0 311 49
to 0 311 49
you 0 311 49
documentation 0 311 49
of 0 311 49
that 0 311 49
about 0 311 49
which 0 311 49
I 0 311 49
have 0 311 49
spoken.” 0 311 49

I 0 311 50
ended 0 311 50
my 0 311 50
memo 0 311 50
by 0 311 50
repeating 0 311 50
to 0 311 50
my 0 311 50
superiors 0 311 50
that 0 311 50
I 0 311 50
thought 0 311 50
it 0 311 50
was 0 311 50
necessary 0 311 50
to 0 311 50
intervene 0 311 50
as 0 311 50
soon 0 311 50
as 0 311 50
possible 0 311 50
by 0 311 50
removing 0 311 50
the 0 311 50
cardinal’s 0 311 50
hat 0 311 50
from 0 311 50
Cardinal 0 311 50
McCarrick 0 311 50
and 0 311 50
that 0 311 50
he 0 311 50
should 0 311 50
be 0 311 50
subjected 0 311 50
to 0 311 50
the 0 311 50
sanctions 0 311 50
established 0 311 50
by 0 311 50
the 0 311 50
Code 0 311 50
of 0 311 50
Canon 0 311 50
Law, 0 311 50
which 0 311 50
also 0 311 50
provide 0 311 50
for 0 311 50
reduction 0 311 50
to 0 311 50
the 0 311 50
lay 0 311 50
state. 0 311 50

This 0 311 51
second 0 311 51
memo 0 311 51
of 0 311 51
mine 0 311 51
was 0 311 51
also 0 311 51
never 0 311 51
returned 0 311 51
to 0 311 51
the 0 311 51
Personnel 0 311 51
Office, 0 311 51
and 0 311 51
I 0 311 51
was 0 311 51
greatly 1 311 51
dismayed 1 311 51
at 0 311 51
my 0 311 51
superiors 0 311 51
for 0 311 51
the 0 311 51
inconceivable 0 311 51
absence 0 311 51
of 0 311 51
any 0 311 51
measure 0 311 51
against 0 311 51
the 0 311 51
Cardinal, 0 311 51
and 0 311 51
for 0 311 51
the 0 311 51
continuing 0 311 51
lack 0 311 51
of 0 311 51
any 0 311 51
communication 0 311 51
with 0 311 51
me 0 311 51
since 0 311 51
my 0 311 51
first 0 311 51
memo 0 311 51
in 0 311 51
December 0 311 51
2006. 0 311 51

But 0 311 52
finally 0 311 52
I 0 311 52
learned 0 311 52
with 0 311 52
certainty, 0 311 52
through 0 311 52
Cardinal 0 311 52
Giovanni 0 311 52
Battista 0 311 52
Re, 0 311 52
then-Prefect 0 311 52
of 0 311 52
the 0 311 52
Congregation 0 311 52
for 0 311 52
Bishops, 0 311 52
that 0 311 52
Richard 0 311 52
Sipe’s 0 311 52
courageous 1 311 52
and 1 311 52
meritorious 1 311 52
Statement 0 311 52
had 0 311 52
had 0 311 52
the 0 311 52
desired 0 311 52
result. 0 311 52

Pope 0 311 53
Benedict 0 311 53
had 0 311 53
imposed 0 311 53
on 0 311 53
Cardinal 0 311 53
McCarrick 0 311 53
sanctions 0 311 53
similar 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
those 0 311 53
now 0 311 53
imposed 0 311 53
on 0 311 53
him 0 311 53
by 0 311 53
Pope 0 311 53
Francis: 0 311 53
the 0 311 53
Cardinal 0 311 53
was 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
leave 0 311 53
the 0 311 53
seminary 0 311 53
where 0 311 53
he 0 311 53
was 0 311 53
living, 0 311 53
he 0 311 53
was 0 311 53
forbidden 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
celebrate 0 311 53
[Mass] 0 311 53
in 0 311 53
public, 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
participate 0 311 53
in 0 311 53
public 0 311 53
meetings, 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
give 0 311 53
lectures, 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
travel, 0 311 53
with 0 311 53
the 0 311 53
obligation 0 311 53
of 0 311 53
dedicating 0 311 53
himself 0 311 53
to 0 311 53
a 0 311 53
life 0 311 53
of 0 311 53
prayer 0 311 53
and 0 311 53
penance. 0 311 53

I 0 311 54
do 0 311 54
not 0 311 54
know 0 311 54
when 0 311 54
Pope 0 311 54
Benedict 0 311 54
took 0 311 54
these 0 311 54
measures 0 311 54
against 0 311 54
McCarrick, 0 311 54
whether 0 311 54
in 0 311 54
2009 0 311 54
or 0 311 54
2010, 0 311 54
because 0 311 54
in 0 311 54
the 0 311 54
meantime 0 311 54
I 0 311 54
had 0 311 54
been 0 311 54
transferred 0 311 54
to 0 311 54
the 0 311 54
Governorate 0 311 54
of 0 311 54
Vatican 0 311 54
City 0 311 54
State, 0 311 54
just 0 311 54
as 0 311 54
I 0 311 54
do 0 311 54
not 0 311 54
know 0 311 54
who 0 311 54
was 0 311 54
responsible 0 311 54
for 0 311 54
this 0 311 54
incredible 1 311 54
delay. 0 311 54

I 0 311 55
certainly 0 311 55
do 0 311 55
not 0 311 55
believe 0 311 55
it 0 311 55
was 0 311 55
Pope 0 311 55
Benedict, 0 311 55
who 0 311 55
as 0 311 55
Cardinal 0 311 55
had 0 311 55
repeatedly 0 311 55
denounced 0 311 55
the 0 311 55
corruption 0 311 55
present 0 311 55
in 0 311 55
the 0 311 55
Church, 0 311 55
and 0 311 55
in 0 311 55
the 0 311 55
first 0 311 55
months 0 311 55
of 0 311 55
his 0 311 55
pontificate 0 311 55
had 0 311 55
already 0 311 55
taken 0 311 55
a 0 311 55
firm 0 311 55
stand 0 311 55
against 0 311 55
the 0 311 55
admission 0 311 55
into 0 311 55
seminary 0 311 55
of 0 311 55
young 0 311 55
men 0 311 55
with 0 311 55
deep 0 311 55
homosexual 0 311 55
tendencies. 0 311 55

I 0 311 56
believe 0 311 56
it 0 311 56
was 0 311 56
due 0 311 56
to 0 311 56
the 0 311 56
Pope’s 0 311 56
first 0 311 56
collaborator 0 311 56
at 0 311 56
the 0 311 56
time, 0 311 56
Cardinal 0 311 56
Tarcisio 0 311 56
Bertone, 0 311 56
who 0 311 56
notoriously 0 311 56
favored 0 311 56
promoting 0 311 56
homosexuals 0 311 56
into 0 311 56
positions 0 311 56
of 0 311 56
responsibility, 0 311 56
and 0 311 56
was 0 311 56
accustomed 0 311 56
to 0 311 56
managing 0 311 56
the 0 311 56
information 0 311 56
he 0 311 56
thought 0 311 56
appropriate 0 311 56
to 0 311 56
convey 0 311 56
to 0 311 56
the 0 311 56
Pope. 0 311 56

In 0 311 57
any 0 311 57
case, 0 311 57
what 0 311 57
is 0 311 57
certain 0 311 57
is 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
Pope 0 311 57
Benedict 0 311 57
imposed 0 311 57
the 0 311 57
above 0 311 57
canonical 0 311 57
sanctions 0 311 57
on 0 311 57
McCarrick 0 311 57
and 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
they 0 311 57
were 0 311 57
communicated 0 311 57
to 0 311 57
him 0 311 57
by 0 311 57
the 0 311 57
Apostolic 0 311 57
Nuncio 0 311 57
to 0 311 57
the 0 311 57
United 0 311 57
States, 0 311 57
Pietro 0 311 57
Sambi. 0 311 57

Monsignor 0 311 58
Jean-François 0 311 58
Lantheaume, 0 311 58
then 0 311 58
first 0 311 58
Counsellor 0 311 58
of 0 311 58
the 0 311 58
Nunciature 0 311 58
in 0 311 58
Washington 0 311 58
and 0 311 58
Chargé 0 311 58
d'Affaires 0 311 58
a.i. 0 311 58

after 0 311 59
the 0 311 59
unexpected 0 311 59
death 0 311 59
of 0 311 59
Nuncio 0 311 59
Sambi 0 311 59
in 0 311 59
Baltimore, 0 311 59
told 0 311 59
me 0 311 59
when 0 311 59
I 0 311 59
arrived 0 311 59
in 0 311 59
Washington 0 311 59
— 0 311 59
and 0 311 59
he 0 311 59
is 0 311 59
ready 0 311 59
to 0 311 59
testify 0 311 59
to 0 311 59
it— 0 311 59
about 0 311 59
a 0 311 59
stormy 0 311 59
conversation, 0 311 59
lasting 0 311 59
over 0 311 59
an 0 311 59
hour, 0 311 59
that 0 311 59
Nuncio 0 311 59
Sambi 0 311 59
had 0 311 59
with 0 311 59
Cardinal 0 311 59
McCarrick 0 311 59
whom 0 311 59
he 0 311 59
had 0 311 59
summoned 0 311 59
to 0 311 59
the 0 311 59
Nunciature. 0 311 59

Monsignor 0 311 60
Lantheaume 0 311 60
told 0 311 60
me 0 311 60
that 0 311 60
“the 0 311 60
Nuncio’s 0 311 60
voice 0 311 60
could 0 311 60
be 0 311 60
heard 0 311 60
all 0 311 60
the 0 311 60
way 0 311 60
out 0 311 60
in 0 311 60
the 0 311 60
corridor.” 0 311 60

Pope 0 311 61
Benedict’s 0 311 61
same 0 311 61
dispositions 0 311 61
were 0 311 61
then 0 311 61
also 0 311 61
communicated 0 311 61
to 0 311 61
me 0 311 61
by 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
new 0 311 61
Prefect 0 311 61
of 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
Congregation 0 311 61
for 0 311 61
Bishops, 0 311 61
Cardinal 0 311 61
Marc 0 311 61
Ouellet, 0 311 61
in 0 311 61
November 0 311 61
2011, 0 311 61
in 0 311 61
a 0 311 61
conversation 0 311 61
before 0 311 61
my 0 311 61
departure 0 311 61
for 0 311 61
Washington, 0 311 61
and 0 311 61
were 0 311 61
included 0 311 61
among 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
instructions 0 311 61
of 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
same 0 311 61
Congregation 0 311 61
to 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
new 0 311 61
Nuncio. 0 311 61

In 0 311 62
turn, 0 311 62
I 0 311 62
repeated 0 311 62
them 0 311 62
to 0 311 62
Cardinal 0 311 62
McCarrick 0 311 62
at 0 311 62
my 0 311 62
first 0 311 62
meeting 0 311 62
with 0 311 62
him 0 311 62
at 0 311 62
the 0 311 62
Nunciature. 0 311 62

The 0 311 63
Cardinal, 0 311 63
muttering 0 311 63
in 0 311 63
a 0 311 63
barely 0 311 63
comprehensible 0 311 63
way, 0 311 63
admitted 0 311 63
that 0 311 63
he 0 311 63
had 0 311 63
perhaps 0 311 63
made 0 311 63
the 0 311 63
mistake 0 311 63
of 0 311 63
sleeping 0 311 63
in 0 311 63
the 0 311 63
same 0 311 63
bed 0 311 63
with 0 311 63
some 0 311 63
seminarians 0 311 63
at 0 311 63
his 0 311 63
beach 0 311 63
house, 0 311 63
but 0 311 63
he 0 311 63
said 0 311 63
this 0 311 63
as 0 311 63
if 0 311 63
it 0 311 63
had 0 311 63
no 0 311 63
importance. 0 311 63

The 0 311 64
faithful 0 311 64
insistently 0 311 64
wonder 0 311 64
how 0 311 64
it 0 311 64
was 0 311 64
possible 0 311 64
for 0 311 64
him 0 311 64
to 0 311 64
be 0 311 64
appointed 0 311 64
to 0 311 64
Washington, 0 311 64
and 0 311 64
as 0 311 64
Cardinal, 0 311 64
and 0 311 64
they 0 311 64
have 0 311 64
every 0 311 64
right 0 311 64
to 0 311 64
know 0 311 64
who 0 311 64
knew, 0 311 64
and 0 311 64
who 0 311 64
covered 0 311 64
up 0 311 64
his 0 311 64
grave 1 311 64
misdeeds. 1 311 64

It 0 311 65
is 0 311 65
therefore 0 311 65
my 0 311 65
duty 0 311 65
to 0 311 65
reveal 0 311 65
what 0 311 65
I 0 311 65
know 0 311 65
about 0 311 65
this, 0 311 65
beginning 0 311 65
with 0 311 65
the 0 311 65
Roman 0 311 65
Curia. 0 311 65

Cardinal 0 311 66
Angelo 0 311 66
Sodano 0 311 66
was 0 311 66
Secretary 0 311 66
of 0 311 66
State 0 311 66
until 0 311 66
September 0 311 66
2006: 0 311 66
all 0 311 66
information 0 311 66
was 0 311 66
communicated 0 311 66
to 0 311 66
him. 0 311 66

In 0 311 67
November 0 311 67
2000, 0 311 67
Nunzio 0 311 67
Montalvo 0 311 67
sent 0 311 67
him 0 311 67
his 0 311 67
report, 0 311 67
passing 0 311 67
on 0 311 67
to 0 311 67
him 0 311 67
the 0 311 67
aforementioned 0 311 67
letter 0 311 67
from 0 311 67
Father 0 311 67
Boniface 0 311 67
Ramsey 0 311 67
in 0 311 67
which 0 311 67
he 0 311 67
denounced 0 311 67
the 0 311 67
serious 0 311 67
abuses 0 311 67
committed 0 311 67
by 0 311 67
McCarrick. 0 311 67

It 0 311 68
is 0 311 68
known 0 311 68
that 0 311 68
Sodano 0 311 68
tried 0 311 68
to 0 311 68
cover 0 311 68
up 0 311 68
the 0 311 68
Father 0 311 68
Maciel 0 311 68
scandal 0 311 68
to 0 311 68
the 0 311 68
end. 0 311 68

He 0 311 69
even 0 311 69
removed 0 311 69
the 0 311 69
Nuncio 0 311 69
in 0 311 69
Mexico 0 311 69
City, 0 311 69
Justo 0 311 69
Mullor, 0 311 69
who 0 311 69
refused 0 311 69
to 0 311 69
be 0 311 69
an 0 311 69
accomplice 0 311 69
in 0 311 69
his 0 311 69
scheme 0 311 69
to 0 311 69
cover 0 311 69
Maciel, 0 311 69
and 0 311 69
in 0 311 69
his 0 311 69
place 0 311 69
appointed 0 311 69
Sandri, 0 311 69
then-Nuncio 0 311 69
to 0 311 69
Venezuela, 0 311 69
who 0 311 69
was 0 311 69
willing 0 311 69
to 0 311 69
collaborate 0 311 69
in 0 311 69
the 0 311 69
cover-up. 0 311 69

Sodano 0 311 70
even 0 311 70
went 0 311 70
so 0 311 70
far 0 311 70
as 0 311 70
to 0 311 70
issue 0 311 70
a 0 311 70
statement 0 311 70
to 0 311 70
the 0 311 70
Vatican 0 311 70
press 0 311 70
office 0 311 70
in 0 311 70
which 0 311 70
a 0 311 70
falsehood 0 311 70
was 0 311 70
affirmed, 0 311 70
that 0 311 70
is, 0 311 70
that 0 311 70
Pope 0 311 70
Benedict 0 311 70
had 0 311 70
decided 0 311 70
that 0 311 70
the 0 311 70
Maciel 0 311 70
case 0 311 70
should 0 311 70
be 0 311 70
considered 0 311 70
closed. 0 311 70

Benedict 0 311 71
reacted, 0 311 71
despite 0 311 71
Sodano’s 0 311 71
strenuous 0 311 71
defense, 0 311 71
and 0 311 71
Maciel 0 311 71
was 0 311 71
found 0 311 71
guilty 0 311 71
and 0 311 71
irrevocably 0 311 71
condemned. 0 311 71

Was 0 311 72
McCarrick’s 0 311 72
appointment 0 311 72
to 0 311 72
Washington 0 311 72
and 0 311 72
as 0 311 72
Cardinal 0 311 72
the 0 311 72
work 0 311 72
of 0 311 72
Sodano, 0 311 72
when 0 311 72
John 0 311 72
Paul 0 311 72
II 0 311 72
was 0 311 72
already 0 311 72
very 0 311 72
ill? 0 311 72

We 0 311 73
are 0 311 73
not 0 311 73
given 0 311 73
to 0 311 73
know. 0 311 73

However, 0 311 74
it 0 311 74
is 0 311 74
legitimate 0 311 74
to 0 311 74
think 0 311 74
so, 0 311 74
but 0 311 74
I 0 311 74
do 0 311 74
not 0 311 74
think 0 311 74
he 0 311 74
was 0 311 74
the 0 311 74
only 0 311 74
one 0 311 74
responsible 0 311 74
for 0 311 74
this. 0 311 74

McCarrick 0 311 75
frequently 0 311 75
went 0 311 75
to 0 311 75
Rome 0 311 75
and 0 311 75
made 0 311 75
friends 0 311 75
everywhere, 0 311 75
at 0 311 75
all 0 311 75
levels 0 311 75
of 0 311 75
the 0 311 75
Curia. 0 311 75

If 0 311 76
Sodano 0 311 76
had 0 311 76
protected 0 311 76
Maciel, 0 311 76
as 0 311 76
seems 0 311 76
certain, 0 311 76
there 0 311 76
is 0 311 76
no 0 311 76
reason 0 311 76
why 0 311 76
he 0 311 76
wouldn’t 0 311 76
have 0 311 76
done 0 311 76
so 0 311 76
for 0 311 76
McCarrick, 0 311 76
who 0 311 76
according 0 311 76
to 0 311 76
many 0 311 76
had 0 311 76
the 0 311 76
financial 0 311 76
means 0 311 76
to 0 311 76

His 0 311 77

See, 0 311 95
Cardinal 0 311 95

whose 0 311 95
situation 0 311 95
is 0 311 95
now 0 311 95
completely 0 311 95
compromised 0 311 95
by 0 311 95
the 0 311 95
recent 0 311 95
revelations 0 311 95

behavior 0 311 95
as 0 311 95
Bishop 0 311 95
of 0 311 95
Pittsburgh. 0 311 95

It 0 311 96
is 0 311 96
absolutely 0 311 96
unthinkable 0 311 96
that 0 311 96
Nunzio 0 311 96
Sambi, 0 311 96
who 0 311 96
was 0 311 96
an 0 311 96
extremely 0 311 96
responsible 0 311 96
person, 0 311 96
loyal, 0 311 96
direct 0 311 96
and 0 311 96
explicit 0 311 96
in 0 311 96
his 0 311 96
way 0 311 96
of 0 311 96
being 0 311 96
(a 0 311 96
true 0 311 96
son 0 311 96
of 0 311 96

did 0 311 96
not 0 311 96
speak 0 311 96

him 0 311 96
about 0 311 96
it. 0 311 96

In 0 311 97
any 0 311 97
case, 0 311 97
I 0 311 97
myself 0 311 97
brought 0 311 97
up 0 311 97
the 0 311 97
subject 0 311 97
with 0 311 97
Cardinal 0 311 97
Wuerl 0 311 97
on 0 311 97
several 0 311 97
occasions, 0 311 97
and 0 311 97
I 0 311 97
certainly 0 311 97
didn’t 0 311 97
need 0 311 97
to 0 311 97
go 0 311 97
into 0 311 97
detail 0 311 97
because 0 311 97
it 0 311 97
was 0 311 97
immediately 0 311 97
clear 0 311 97
to 0 311 97
me 0 311 97
that 0 311 97
he 0 311 97
was 0 311 97
fully 0 311 97
aware 0 311 97
of 0 311 97
it. 0 311 97

I 0 311 98
also 0 311 98
remember 0 311 98
in 0 311 98
particular 0 311 98
the 0 311 98
fact 0 311 98
that 0 311 98
I 0 311 98
had 0 311 98
to 0 311 98
draw 0 311 98
his 0 311 98
attention 0 311 98
to 0 311 98
it, 0 311 98
because 0 311 98
I 0 311 98
realized 0 311 98
that 0 311 98
in 0 311 98
an 0 311 98
archdiocesan 0 311 98
publication, 0 311 98
on 0 311 98
the 0 311 98
back 0 311 98
cover 0 311 98
in 0 311 98
color, 0 311 98
there 0 311 98
was 0 311 98
an 0 311 98
announcement 0 311 98
inviting 0 311 98
young 0 311 98
men 0 311 98
who 0 311 98
thought 0 311 98
they 0 311 98
had 0 311 98
a 0 311 98
vocation 0 311 98
to 0 311 98
the 0 311 98
priesthood 0 311 98
to 0 311 98
a 0 311 98
meeting 0 311 98
with 0 311 98
Cardinal 0 311 98
McCarrick. 0 311 98

I 0 311 99
immediately 0 311 99
phoned 0 311 99
Cardinal 0 311 99
Wuerl, 0 311 99
who 0 311 99
expressed 0 311 99
his 0 311 99
surprise 0 311 99
to 0 311 99
me, 0 311 99
telling 0 311 99
me 0 311 99
that 0 311 99
he 0 311 99
knew 0 311 99
nothing 0 311 99
about 0 311 99
that 0 311 99
announcement 0 311 99
and 0 311 99
that 0 311 99
he 0 311 99
would 0 311 99
cancel 0 311 99
it. 0 311 99

If, 0 311 100
as 0 311 100
he 0 311 100
now 0 311 100
continues 0 311 100
to 0 311 100
state, 0 311 100
he 0 311 100
knew 0 311 100
nothing 0 311 100
of 0 311 100
the 0 311 100
abuses 0 311 100
committed 0 311 100
by 0 311 100
McCarrick 0 311 100
and 0 311 100
the 0 311 100
measures 0 311 100
taken 0 311 100
by 0 311 100
Pope 0 311 100
Benedict, 0 311 100
how 0 311 100
can 0 311 100
his 0 311 100
answer 0 311 100
be 0 311 100
explained? 0 311 100

His 0 311 101
recent 0 311 101
statements 0 311 101
that 0 311 101
he 0 311 101
knew 0 311 101
nothing 0 311 101
about 0 311 101
it, 0 311 101
even 0 311 101
though 0 311 101
at 0 311 101
first 0 311 101
he 0 311 101
cunningly 0 311 101
referred 0 311 101
to 0 311 101
compensation 0 311 101
for 0 311 101
the 0 311 101
two 0 311 101
victims, 0 311 101
are 0 311 101
absolutely 1 311 101
laughable. 1 311 101

The 0 311 102
Cardinal 0 311 102
lies 0 311 102
shamelessly 1 311 102
and 0 311 102
prevails 0 311 102
upon 0 311 102
his 0 311 102
Chancellor, 0 311 102
Monsignor 0 311 102
Antonicelli, 0 311 102
to 0 311 102
lie 0 311 102
as 0 311 102
well. 0 311 102

Cardinal 0 311 103
Wuerl 0 311 103
also 0 311 103
clearly 0 311 103
lied 0 311 103
on 0 311 103
another 0 311 103
occasion. 0 311 103

Following 0 311 104
a 0 311 104
morally 0 311 104
unacceptable 0 311 104
event 0 311 104
authorized 0 311 104
by 0 311 104
the 0 311 104
academic 0 311 104
authorities 0 311 104
of 0 311 104
Georgetown 0 311 104
University, 0 311 104
I 0 311 104
brought 0 311 104
it 0 311 104
to 0 311 104
the 0 311 104
attention 0 311 104
of 0 311 104
its 0 311 104
President, 0 311 104
Dr. 0 311 104
John 0 311 104
DeGioia, 0 311 104
sending 0 311 104
him 0 311 104
two 0 311 104
subsequent 0 311 104
letters. 0 311 104

Before 0 311 105
forwarding 0 311 105
them 0 311 105
to 0 311 105
the 0 311 105
addressee, 0 311 105
so 0 311 105
as 0 311 105
to 0 311 105
handle 0 311 105
things 0 311 105
properly, 0 311 105
I 0 311 105
personally 0 311 105
gave 0 311 105
a 0 311 105
copy 0 311 105
of 0 311 105
them 0 311 105
to 0 311 105
the 0 311 105
Cardinal 0 311 105
with 0 311 105
an 0 311 105
accompanying 0 311 105
letter 0 311 105
I 0 311 105
had 0 311 105
written. 0 311 105

The 0 311 106
Cardinal 0 311 106
told 0 311 106
me 0 311 106
that 0 311 106
he 0 311 106
knew 0 311 106
nothing 0 311 106
about 0 311 106
it. 0 311 106

However, 0 311 107
he 0 311 107
failed 0 311 107
to 0 311 107
acknowledge 0 311 107
receipt 0 311 107
of 0 311 107
my 0 311 107
two 0 311 107
letters, 0 311 107
contrary 0 311 107
to 0 311 107
what 0 311 107
he 0 311 107
customarily 0 311 107
did. 0 311 107

I 0 311 108
subsequently 0 311 108
learned 0 311 108
that 0 311 108
the 0 311 108
event 0 311 108
at 0 311 108
Georgetown 0 311 108
had 0 311 108
taken 0 311 108
place 0 311 108
for 0 311 108
seven 0 311 108
years. 0 311 108

But 0 311 109
the 0 311 109
Cardinal 0 311 109
knew 0 311 109
nothing 0 311 109
about 0 311 109
it! 0 311 109

Cardinal 0 311 110
Wuerl, 0 311 110
well 0 311 110
aware 0 311 110
of 0 311 110
the 0 311 110
continuous 0 311 110
abuses 0 311 110
committed 0 311 110
by 0 311 110
Cardinal 0 311 110
McCarrick 0 311 110
and 0 311 110
the 0 311 110
sanctions 0 311 110
imposed 0 311 110
on 0 311 110
him 0 311 110
by 0 311 110
Pope 0 311 110
Benedict, 0 311 110
transgressing 0 311 110
the 0 311 110
Pope’s 0 311 110
order, 0 311 110
also 0 311 110
allowed 0 311 110
him 0 311 110
to 0 311 110
reside 0 311 110
at 0 311 110
a 0 311 110
seminary 0 311 110
in 0 311 110
Washington 0 311 110
D.C. 0 311 110

In 0 311 111
doing 0 311 111
so, 0 311 111
he 0 311 111
put 0 311 111
other 0 311 111
seminarians 0 311 111
at 0 311 111
risk. 0 311 111

Bishop 0 311 112
Paul 0 311 112
Bootkoski, 0 311 112
emeritus 0 311 112
of 0 311 112
Metuchen, 0 311 112
and 0 311 112
Archbishop 0 311 112
John 0 311 112
Myers, 0 311 112
emeritus 0 311 112
of 0 311 112
Newark, 0 311 112
covered 0 311 112
up 0 311 112
the 0 311 112
abuses 0 311 112
committed 0 311 112
by 0 311 112
McCarrick 0 311 112
in 0 311 112
their 0 311 112
respective 0 311 112
dioceses 0 311 112
and 0 311 112
compensated 0 311 112
two 0 311 112
of 0 311 112
his 0 311 112
victims. 0 311 112

They 0 311 113
cannot 0 311 113
deny 0 311 113
it 0 311 113
and 0 311 113
they 0 311 113
must 0 311 113
be 0 311 113
interrogated 0 311 113
in 0 311 113
order 0 311 113
to 0 311 113
reveal 0 311 113
every 0 311 113
circumstance 0 311 113
and 0 311 113
all 0 311 113
responsibility 0 311 113
regarding 0 311 113
this 0 311 113
matter. 0 311 113

Cardinal 0 311 114
Kevin 0 311 114
Farrell, 0 311 114
who 0 311 114
was 0 311 114
recently 0 311 114
interviewed 0 311 114
by 0 311 114
the 0 311 114
media, 0 311 114
also 0 311 114
said 0 311 114
that 0 311 114
he 0 311 114
didn’t 0 311 114
have 0 311 114
the 0 311 114
slightest 0 311 114
idea 0 311 114
about 0 311 114
the 0 311 114
abuses 0 311 114
committed 0 311 114
by 0 311 114
McCarrick. 0 311 114

Given 0 311 115
his 0 311 115
tenure 0 311 115
in 0 311 115
Washington, 0 311 115
Dallas 0 311 115
and 0 311 115
now 0 311 115
Rome, 0 311 115
I 0 311 115
think 0 311 115
no 0 311 115
one 0 311 115
can 0 311 115
honestly 0 311 115
believe 0 311 115
him. 0 311 115

I 0 311 116
don’t 0 311 116
know 0 311 116
if 0 311 116
he 0 311 116
was 0 311 116
ever 0 311 116
asked 0 311 116
if 0 311 116
he 0 311 116
knew 0 311 116
about 0 311 116
Maciel’s 0 311 116
crimes. 0 311 116

If 0 311 117
he 0 311 117
were 0 311 117
to 0 311 117
deny 0 311 117
this, 0 311 117
would 0 311 117
anybody 0 311 117
believe 0 311 117
him 0 311 117
given 0 311 117
that 0 311 117
he 0 311 117
occupied 0 311 117
positions 0 311 117
of 0 311 117
responsibility 0 311 117
as 0 311 117
a 0 311 117
member 0 311 117
of 0 311 117
the 0 311 117
Legionaries 0 311 117
of 0 311 117
Christ? 0 311 117

Regarding 0 311 118
Cardinal 0 311 118
Sean 0 311 118
O’Malley, 0 311 118
I 0 311 118
would 0 311 118
simply 0 311 118
say 0 311 118
that 0 311 118
his 0 311 118
latest 0 311 118
statements 0 311 118
on 0 311 118
the 0 311 118
McCarrick 0 311 118
case 0 311 118
are 0 311 118
disconcerting, 1 311 118
and 0 311 118
have 0 311 118
totally 1 311 118
obscured 0 311 118
his 0 311 118
transparency 0 311 118
and 0 311 118
credibility. 0 311 118

My 0 311 120
conscience 0 311 120
requires 0 311 120
me 0 311 120
also 0 311 120
to 0 311 120
reveal 0 311 120
facts 0 311 120
that 0 311 120
I 0 311 120
have 0 311 120
experienced 0 311 120
personally, 0 311 120
concerning 0 311 120
Pope 0 311 120
Francis, 0 311 120
that 0 311 120
have 0 311 120
a 0 311 120
dramatic 1 311 120
significance, 0 311 120
which 0 311 120
as 0 311 120

sharing 0 311 120
the 0 311 120
collegial 0 311 120

for 0 311 120
the 0 311 120
universal 0 311 120
Church, 0 311 120
do 0 311 120
not 0 311 120
allow 0 311 120
me 0 311 120
to 0 311 120
remain 0 311 120
silent, 0 311 120
and 0 311 120
that 0 311 120
I 0 311 120
state 0 311 120
here, 0 311 120
ready 0 311 120
to 0 311 120
reaffirm 0 311 120
them 0 311 120
under 0 311 120

by 0 311 120
calling 0 311 120
on 0 311 120
God 0 311 120
as 0 311 120
my 0 311 120
witness. 0 311 120

In 0 311 121
the 0 311 121
last 0 311 121
months 0 311 121
of 0 311 121
his 0 311 121
pontificate, 0 311 121
Pope 0 311 121
Benedict 0 311 121
XVI 0 311 121
had 0 311 121
convened 0 311 121

all 0 311 121

as 0 311 121
Paul 0 311 121

St. 0 311 121
John 0 311 121
Paul 0 311 121
II 0 311 121
had 0 311 121
done 0 311 121
on 0 311 121
several 0 311 121
occasions. 0 311 121

The 0 311 122
date 0 311 122
set 0 311 122
for 0 311 122
the 0 311 122
audience 0 311 122
with 0 311 122
the 0 311 122
Pope 0 311 122
was 0 311 122
Friday, 0 311 122

21, 0 311 122
2013. 0 311 122

Pope 0 311 123
Francis 0 311 123
kept 0 311 123
this 0 311 123
commitment 0 311 123
made 0 311 123
by 0 311 123
his 0 311 123
predecessor. 0 311 123

Of 0 311 124
course 0 311 124
I 0 311 124
also 0 311 124
came 0 311 124
to 0 311 124
Rome 0 311 124
from 0 311 124
Washington. 0 311 124

It 0 311 125
was 0 311 125
my 0 311 125
first 0 311 125
meeting 0 311 125
with 0 311 125
the 0 311 125
new 0 311 125

only 0 311 125
three 0 311 125
months 0 311 125
prior, 0 311 125
after 0 311 125
the 0 311 125

Pope 0 311 125
Benedict. 0 311 125

On 0 311 126
the 0 311 126
morning 0 311 126
of 0 311 126
Thursday, 0 311 126
June 0 311 126
20, 0 311 126
2013, 0 311 126
I 0 311 126
went 0 311 126
to 0 311 126
the 0 311 126
Domus 0 311 126
Sanctae 0 311 126
Marthae, 0 311 126
to 0 311 126
join 0 311 126
my 0 311 126
colleagues 0 311 126
who 0 311 126
were 0 311 126
staying 0 311 126
there. 0 311 126

As 0 311 127
soon 0 311 127
as 0 311 127
I 0 311 127
entered 0 311 127
the 0 311 127
hall 0 311 127
I 0 311 127
met 0 311 127
Cardinal 0 311 127
McCarrick, 0 311 127
who 0 311 127
wore 0 311 127
the 0 311 127
red-trimmed 0 311 127
cassock. 0 311 127

I 0 311 128
greeted 0 311 128
him 0 311 128
respectfully 0 311 128
as 0 311 128
I 0 311 128
had 0 311 128
always 0 311 128
done. 0 311 128

He 0 311 129
immediately 0 311 129
said 0 311 129
to 0 311 129
me, 0 311 129
in 0 311 129
a 0 311 129
tone 0 311 129
somewhere 0 311 129
between 0 311 129
ambiguous 0 311 129
and 0 311 129
triumphant: 0 311 129
“The 0 311 129
Pope 0 311 129
received 0 311 129
me 0 311 129
yesterday, 0 311 129
tomorrow 0 311 129
I 0 311 129
am 0 311 129
going 0 311 129
to 0 311 129
China.” 0 311 129

At 0 311 130
the 0 311 130
time 0 311 130
I 0 311 130
knew 0 311 130
nothing 0 311 130
of 0 311 130
his 0 311 130
long 0 311 130
friendship 0 311 130
with 0 311 130
Cardinal 0 311 130
Bergoglio 0 311 130
and 0 311 130
of 0 311 130
the 0 311 130
important 0 311 130
part 0 311 130
he 0 311 130
had 0 311 130
played 0 311 130
in 0 311 130
his 0 311 130
recent 0 311 130
election, 0 311 130
as 0 311 130
McCarrick 0 311 130
himself 0 311 130
would 0 311 130
later 0 311 130
reveal 0 311 130
in 0 311 130
a 0 311 130
lecture 0 311 130
at 0 311 130
Villanova 0 311 130
University 0 311 130
and 0 311 130
in 0 311 130
an 0 311 130
interview 0 311 130
with 0 311 130
the 0 311 130
National 0 311 130
Catholic 0 311 130
Reporter. 0 311 130

Nor 0 311 131
had 0 311 131
I 0 311 131
ever 0 311 131
thought 0 311 131
of 0 311 131
the 0 311 131
fact 0 311 131
that 0 311 131
he 0 311 131
had 0 311 131
participated 0 311 131
in 0 311 131
the 0 311 131
preliminary 0 311 131
meetings 0 311 131
of 0 311 131
the 0 311 131
recent 0 311 131
conclave, 0 311 131
and 0 311 131
of 0 311 131
the 0 311 131
role 0 311 131
he 0 311 131
had 0 311 131
been 0 311 131
able 0 311 131
to 0 311 131
have 0 311 131
as 0 311 131
a 0 311 131
cardinal 0 311 131
elector 0 311 131
in 0 311 131
the 0 311 131
2005 0 311 131
conclave. 0 311 131

Therefore 0 311 132
I 0 311 132
did 0 311 132
not 0 311 132
immediately 0 311 132
grasp 0 311 132
the 0 311 132
meaning 0 311 132
of 0 311 132
the 0 311 132
encrypted 0 311 132
message 0 311 132
that 0 311 132
McCarrick 0 311 132
had 0 311 132
communicated 0 311 132
to 0 311 132
me, 0 311 132
but 0 311 132
that 0 311 132
would 0 311 132
become 0 311 132
clear 0 311 132
to 0 311 132
me 0 311 132
in 0 311 132
the 0 311 132
days 0 311 132
immediately 0 311 132
following. 0 311 132

The 0 311 133
next 0 311 133
day 0 311 133
the 0 311 133
audience 0 311 133
with 0 311 133
Pope 0 311 133
Francis 0 311 133
took 0 311 133
place. 0 311 133

After 0 311 134
his 0 311 134
address, 0 311 134
which 0 311 134
was 0 311 134
partly 0 311 134
read 0 311 134
and 0 311 134
partly 0 311 134
delivered 0 311 134
off 0 311 134
the 0 311 134
cuff, 0 311 134
the 0 311 134
Pope 0 311 134
wished 0 311 134
to 0 311 134
greet 0 311 134
all 0 311 134
the 0 311 134
nuncios 0 311 134
one 0 311 134
by 0 311 134
one. 0 311 134

In 0 311 135
single 0 311 135
file, 0 311 135
I 0 311 135
remember 0 311 135
that 0 311 135
I 0 311 135
was 0 311 135
among 0 311 135
the 0 311 135
last. 0 311 135

When 0 311 136
it 0 311 136
was 0 311 136
my 0 311 136
turn, 0 311 136
I 0 311 136
just 0 311 136
had 0 311 136
time 0 311 136
to 0 311 136
say 0 311 136
to 0 311 136
him, 0 311 136
“I 0 311 136
am 0 311 136
the 0 311 136
Nuncio 0 311 136
to 0 311 136
the 0 311 136
United 0 311 136
States.” 0 311 136
He 0 311 136
immediately 0 311 136
assailed 0 311 136
me 0 311 136
with 0 311 136
a 0 311 136
tone 0 311 136
of 0 311 136
reproach, 0 311 136
using 0 311 136
these 0 311 136
words: 0 311 136
“The 0 311 136
Bishops 0 311 136
in 0 311 136
the 0 311 136
United 0 311 136
States 0 311 136
must 0 311 136
not 0 311 136
be 0 311 136
ideologized! 0 311 136

They 0 311 137
must 0 311 137
be 0 311 137
shepherds!”Of 0 311 137
course 0 311 137
I 0 311 137
was 0 311 137
not 0 311 137
in 0 311 137
a 0 311 137
position 0 311 137
to 0 311 137
ask 0 311 137
for 0 311 137
explanations 0 311 137
about 0 311 137
the 0 311 137
meaning 0 311 137
of 0 311 137
his 0 311 137
words 0 311 137
and 0 311 137
the 0 311 137
aggressive 1 311 137
way 0 311 137
in 0 311 137
which 0 311 137
he 0 311 137
had 0 311 137
upbraided 0 311 137
me. 0 311 137

I 0 311 138
had 0 311 138
in 0 311 138
my 0 311 138
hand 0 311 138
a 0 311 138
book 0 311 138
in 0 311 138
Portuguese 0 311 138
that 0 311 138
Cardinal 0 311 138
O’Malley 0 311 138
had 0 311 138
sent 0 311 138
me 0 311 138
for 0 311 138
the 0 311 138
Pope 0 311 138
a 0 311 138
few 0 311 138
days 0 311 138
earlier, 0 311 138
telling 0 311 138
me 0 311 138
“so 0 311 138
he 0 311 138
could 0 311 138
go 0 311 138
over 0 311 138
his 0 311 138
Portuguese 0 311 138
before 0 311 138
going 0 311 138
to 0 311 138
Rio 0 311 138
for 0 311 138
World 0 311 138
Youth 0 311 138
Day.” 0 311 138
I 0 311 138
handed 0 311 138
it 0 311 138
to 0 311 138
him 0 311 138
immediately, 0 311 138
and 0 311 138
so 0 311 138
freed 0 311 138
myself 0 311 138
from 0 311 138
that 0 311 138
extremely 0 311 138
disconcerting 0 311 138
and 0 311 138
embarrassing 0 311 138
situation. 0 311 138

At 0 311 139
the 0 311 139
end 0 311 139
of 0 311 139
the 0 311 139
audience 0 311 139
the 0 311 139
Pope 0 311 139
announced: 0 311 139
“Those 0 311 139
of 0 311 139
you 0 311 139
who 0 311 139
are 0 311 139
still 0 311 139
in 0 311 139
Rome 0 311 139
next 0 311 139
Sunday 0 311 139
are 0 311 139
invited 0 311 139
to 0 311 139
concelebrate 0 311 139
with 0 311 139
me 0 311 139
at 0 311 139
the 0 311 139
Domus 0 311 139
Sanctae 0 311 139
Marthae.” 0 311 139
I 0 311 139
naturally 0 311 139
thought 0 311 139
of 0 311 139
staying 0 311 139
on 0 311 139
to 0 311 139
clarify 0 311 139
as 0 311 139
soon 0 311 139
as 0 311 139
possible 0 311 139
what 0 311 139
the 0 311 139
Pope 0 311 139
intended 0 311 139
to 0 311 139
tell 0 311 139
me. 0 311 139

On 0 311 140
Sunday 0 311 140
June 0 311 140
23, 0 311 140
before 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
concelebration 0 311 140
with 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
Pope, 0 311 140
I 0 311 140
asked 0 311 140
Monsignor 0 311 140
Ricca, 0 311 140
who 0 311 140
as 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
person 0 311 140
in 0 311 140
charge 0 311 140
of 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
house 0 311 140
helped 0 311 140
us 0 311 140
put 0 311 140
on 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
vestments, 0 311 140
if 0 311 140
he 0 311 140
could 0 311 140
ask 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
Pope 0 311 140
if 0 311 140
he 0 311 140
could 0 311 140
receive 0 311 140
me 0 311 140
sometime 0 311 140
in 0 311 140
the 0 311 140
following 0 311 140
week. 0 311 140

How 0 311 141
could 0 311 141
I 0 311 141
have 0 311 141
returned 0 311 141
to 0 311 141
Washington 0 311 141
without 0 311 141
having 0 311 141
clarified 0 311 141
what 0 311 141
the 0 311 141
Pope 0 311 141
wanted 0 311 141
of 0 311 141
me? 0 311 141

At 0 311 142
the 0 311 142
end 0 311 142
of 0 311 142
Mass, 0 311 142
while 0 311 142
the 0 311 142
Pope 0 311 142
was 0 311 142
greeting 0 311 142
the 0 311 142
few 0 311 142
lay 0 311 142
people 0 311 142
present, 0 311 142
Monsignor 0 311 142
Fabian 0 311 142
Pedacchio, 0 311 142
his 0 311 142
Argentine 0 311 142
secretary, 0 311 142
came 0 311 142
to 0 311 142
me 0 311 142
and 0 311 142
said: 0 311 142
“The 0 311 142
Pope 0 311 142
told 0 311 142
me 0 311 142
to 0 311 142
ask 0 311 142
if 0 311 142
you 0 311 142
are 0 311 142
free 0 311 142
now!” 0 311 142
Naturally, 0 311 142
I 0 311 142
replied 0 311 142
that 0 311 142
I 0 311 142
was 0 311 142
at 0 311 142
the 0 311 142
Pope’s 0 311 142
disposal 0 311 142
and 0 311 142
that 0 311 142
I 0 311 142
thanked 0 311 142
him 0 311 142
for 0 311 142
receiving 0 311 142
me 0 311 142
immediately. 0 311 142

The 0 311 143
Pope 0 311 143
took 0 311 143
me 0 311 143
to 0 311 143
the 0 311 143
first 0 311 143
floor 0 311 143
in 0 311 143
his 0 311 143
apartment 0 311 143
and 0 311 143
said: 0 311 143
“We 0 311 143
have 0 311 143
40 0 311 143
minutes 0 311 143
before 0 311 143
the 0 311 143
Angelus.” 0 311 143

I 0 311 144
began 0 311 144
the 0 311 144
conversation, 0 311 144
asking 0 311 144
the 0 311 144
Pope 0 311 144
what 0 311 144
he 0 311 144
intended 0 311 144
to 0 311 144
say 0 311 144
to 0 311 144
me 0 311 144
with 0 311 144
the 0 311 144
words 0 311 144
he 0 311 144
had 0 311 144
addressed 0 311 144
to 0 311 144
me 0 311 144
when 0 311 144
I 0 311 144
greeted 0 311 144
him 0 311 144
the 0 311 144
previous 0 311 144
Friday. 0 311 144

And 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
Pope, 0 311 145
in 0 311 145
a 0 311 145
very 0 311 145
different, 0 311 145
friendly, 0 311 145
almost 0 311 145
affectionate 0 311 145
tone, 0 311 145
said 0 311 145
to 0 311 145
me: 0 311 145
“Yes, 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
Bishops 0 311 145
in 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
United 0 311 145
States 0 311 145
must 0 311 145
not 0 311 145
be 0 311 145
ideologized, 0 311 145
they 0 311 145
must 0 311 145
not 0 311 145
be 0 311 145
right-wing 0 311 145
like 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
Archbishop 0 311 145
of 0 311 145
Philadelphia, 0 311 145
(the 0 311 145
Pope 0 311 145
did 0 311 145
not 0 311 145
give 0 311 145
me 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
name 0 311 145
of 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
Archbishop) 0 311 145
they 0 311 145
must 0 311 145
be 0 311 145
shepherds; 0 311 145
and 0 311 145
they 0 311 145
must 0 311 145
not 0 311 145
be 0 311 145
left-wing 0 311 145
— 0 311 145
and 0 311 145
he 0 311 145
added, 0 311 145
raising 0 311 145
both 0 311 145
arms 0 311 145
— 0 311 145
and 0 311 145
when 0 311 145
I 0 311 145
say 0 311 145
left-wing 0 311 145
I 0 311 145
mean 0 311 145
homosexual.” 0 311 145
Of 0 311 145
course, 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
logic 0 311 145
of 0 311 145
the 0 311 145
correlation 0 311 145
between 0 311 145
being 0 311 145
left-wing 0 311 145
and 0 311 145
being 0 311 145
homosexual 0 311 145
escaped 0 311 145
me, 0 311 145
but 0 311 145
I 0 311 145
added 0 311 145
nothing 0 311 145
else. 0 311 145

Immediately 0 311 146
after, 0 311 146
the 0 311 146
Pope 0 311 146
asked 0 311 146
me 0 311 146
in 0 311 146
a 0 311 146
deceitful 0 311 146
way: 0 311 146
“What 0 311 146
is 0 311 146
Cardinal 0 311 146
McCarrick 0 311 146
like?” 0 311 146
I 0 311 146
answered 0 311 146
him 0 311 146
with 0 311 146
complete 0 311 146
frankness 0 311 146
and, 0 311 146
if 0 311 146
you 0 311 146
want, 0 311 146
with 0 311 146
great 0 311 146
naiveté: 0 311 146
“Holy 0 311 146
Father, 0 311 146
I 0 311 146
don’t 0 311 146
know 0 311 146
if 0 311 146
you 0 311 146
know 0 311 146
Cardinal 0 311 146
McCarrick, 0 311 146
but 0 311 146
if 0 311 146
you 0 311 146
ask 0 311 146
the 0 311 146
Congregation 0 311 146
for 0 311 146
Bishops 0 311 146
there 0 311 146
is 0 311 146
a 0 311 146
dossier 0 311 146
this 0 311 146
thick 0 311 146
about 0 311 146
him. 0 311 146

He 0 311 147
corrupted 0 311 147
generations 0 311 147
of 0 311 147
seminarians 0 311 147
and 0 311 147
priests 0 311 147
and 0 311 147
Pope 0 311 147
Benedict 0 311 147
ordered 0 311 147
him 0 311 147
to 0 311 147
withdraw 0 311 147
to 0 311 147
a 0 311 147
life 0 311 147
of 0 311 147
prayer 0 311 147
and 0 311 147
penance.” 0 311 147
The 0 311 147
Pope 0 311 147
did 0 311 147
not 0 311 147
make 0 311 147
the 0 311 147
slightest 0 311 147
comment 0 311 147
about 0 311 147
those 0 311 147
very 1 311 147
grave 1 311 147
words 0 311 147
of 0 311 147
mine 0 311 147
and 0 311 147
did 0 311 147
not 0 311 147
show 0 311 147
any 0 311 147
expression 0 311 147
of 0 311 147
surprise 0 311 147
on 0 311 147
his 0 311 147
face, 0 311 147
as 0 311 147
if 0 311 147
he 0 311 147
had 0 311 147
already 0 311 147
known 0 311 147
the 0 311 147
matter 0 311 147
for 0 311 147
some 0 311 147
time, 0 311 147
and 0 311 147
he 0 311 147
immediately 0 311 147
changed 0 311 147
the 0 311 147
subject. 0 311 147

But 0 311 148
then, 0 311 148
what 0 311 148
was 0 311 148
the 0 311 148
Pope’s 0 311 148
purpose 0 311 148
in 0 311 148
asking 0 311 148
me 0 311 148
that 0 311 148
question: 0 311 148
“What 0 311 148
is 0 311 148
Cardinal 0 311 148
McCarrick 0 311 148
like?” 0 311 148
He 0 311 148
clearly 0 311 148
wanted 0 311 148
to 0 311 148
find 0 311 148
out 0 311 148
if 0 311 148
I 0 311 148
was 0 311 148
an 0 311 148
ally 0 311 148
of 0 311 148
McCarrick 0 311 148
or 0 311 148
not. 0 311 148

Back 0 311 149
in 0 311 149
Washington 0 311 149
everything 0 311 149
became 0 311 149
very 0 311 149
clear 0 311 149
to 0 311 149
me, 0 311 149
thanks 0 311 149
also 0 311 149
to 0 311 149
a 0 311 149
new 0 311 149
event 0 311 149
that 0 311 149
occurred 0 311 149
only 0 311 149
a 0 311 149
few 0 311 149
days 0 311 149
after 0 311 149
my 0 311 149
meeting 0 311 149
with 0 311 149
Pope 0 311 149
Francis. 0 311 149

When 0 311 150
the 0 311 150
new 0 311 150
Bishop 0 311 150
Mark 0 311 150
Seitz 0 311 150
took 0 311 150
possession 0 311 150
of 0 311 150
the 0 311 150
Diocese 0 311 150
of 0 311 150
El 0 311 150
Paso 0 311 150
on 0 311 150
July 0 311 150
9, 0 311 150
2013, 0 311 150
I 0 311 150
sent 0 311 150
the 0 311 150
first 0 311 150
Counsellor, 0 311 150
Monsignor 0 311 150
Jean-François 0 311 150
Lantheaume, 0 311 150
while 0 311 150
I 0 311 150
went 0 311 150
to 0 311 150
Dallas 0 311 150
that 0 311 150
same 0 311 150
day 0 311 150
for 0 311 150
an 0 311 150
international 0 311 150
meeting 0 311 150
on 0 311 150
Bioethics. 0 311 150

When 0 311 151
he 0 311 151
got 0 311 151
back, 0 311 151
Monsignor 0 311 151
Lantheaume 0 311 151
told 0 311 151
me 0 311 151
that 0 311 151
in 0 311 151
El 0 311 151
Paso 0 311 151
he 0 311 151
had 0 311 151
met 0 311 151
Cardinal 0 311 151
McCarrick 0 311 151
who, 0 311 151
taking 0 311 151
him 0 311 151
aside, 0 311 151
told 0 311 151
him 0 311 151
almost 0 311 151
the 0 311 151
same 0 311 151
words 0 311 151
that 0 311 151
the 0 311 151
Pope 0 311 151
had 0 311 151
said 0 311 151
to 0 311 151
me 0 311 151
in 0 311 151
Rome: 0 311 151
“the 0 311 151
Bishops 0 311 151
in 0 311 151
the 0 311 151
United 0 311 151
States 0 311 151
must 0 311 151
not 0 311 151
be 0 311 151
ideologized, 0 311 151
they 0 311 151
must 0 311 151
not 0 311 151
be 0 311 151
right-wing, 0 311 151
they 0 311 151
must 0 311 151
be 0 311 151
shepherds….” 0 311 151
I 0 311 151
was 0 311 151
astounded! 0 311 151

It 0 311 152
was 0 311 152
therefore 0 311 152
clear 0 311 152
that 0 311 152
the 0 311 152
words 0 311 152
of 0 311 152
reproach 0 311 152
that 0 311 152
Pope 0 311 152
Francis 0 311 152
had 0 311 152
addressed 0 311 152
to 0 311 152
me 0 311 152
on 0 311 152
June 0 311 152
21, 0 311 152
2013 0 311 152
had 0 311 152
been 0 311 152
put 0 311 152
into 0 311 152
his 0 311 152
mouth 0 311 152
the 0 311 152
day 0 311 152
before 0 311 152
by 0 311 152
Cardinal 0 311 152
McCarrick. 0 311 152

Also 0 311 153
the 0 311 153
Pope’s 0 311 153
mention 0 311 153
“not 0 311 153
like 0 311 153
the 0 311 153
Archbishop 0 311 153
of 0 311 153
Philadelphia” 0 311 153
could 0 311 153
be 0 311 153
traced 0 311 153
to 0 311 153
McCarrick, 0 311 153
because 0 311 153
there 0 311 153
had 0 311 153
been 0 311 153
a 0 311 153
strong 0 311 153
disagreement 0 311 153
between 0 311 153
the 0 311 153
two 0 311 153
of 0 311 153
them 0 311 153
about 0 311 153
the 0 311 153
admission 0 311 153
to 0 311 153
Communion 0 311 153
of 0 311 153
pro-abortion 0 311 153
politicians. 0 311 153

In 0 311 154
his 0 311 154
communication 0 311 154
to 0 311 154
the 0 311 154
bishops, 0 311 154
McCarrick 0 311 154
had 0 311 154
manipulated 0 311 154
a 0 311 154
letter 0 311 154
of 0 311 154
then-Cardinal 0 311 154
Ratzinger 0 311 154
who 0 311 154
prohibited 0 311 154
giving 0 311 154
them 0 311 154
Communion. 0 311 154

Indeed, 0 311 155
I 0 311 155
also 0 311 155
knew 0 311 155
how 0 311 155
certain 0 311 155
Cardinals 0 311 155
such 0 311 155
as 0 311 155
Mahony, 0 311 155
Levada 0 311 155
and 0 311 155
Wuerl, 0 311 155
were 0 311 155
closely 0 311 155
linked 0 311 155
to 0 311 155
McCarrick; 0 311 155
they 0 311 155
had 0 311 155
opposed 0 311 155
the 0 311 155
most 0 311 155
recent 0 311 155
appointments 0 311 155
made 0 311 155
by 0 311 155
Pope 0 311 155
Benedict, 0 311 155
for 0 311 155
important 0 311 155
posts 0 311 155
such 0 311 155
as 0 311 155
Philadelphia, 0 311 155
Baltimore, 0 311 155
Denver 0 311 155
and 0 311 155
San 0 311 155
Francisco. 0 311 155

Not 0 311 156
happy 0 311 156
with 0 311 156
the 0 311 156
trap 0 311 156
he 0 311 156
had 0 311 156
set 0 311 156
for 0 311 156
me 0 311 156
on 0 311 156
June 0 311 156
23, 0 311 156
2013, 0 311 156
when 0 311 156
he 0 311 156
asked 0 311 156
me 0 311 156
about 0 311 156
McCarrick, 0 311 156
only 0 311 156
a 0 311 156
few 0 311 156
months 0 311 156
later, 0 311 156
in 0 311 156
the 0 311 156
audience 0 311 156
he 0 311 156
granted 0 311 156
me 0 311 156
on 0 311 156
October 0 311 156
10, 0 311 156
2013, 0 311 156
Pope 0 311 156
Francis 0 311 156
set 0 311 156
a 0 311 156
second 0 311 156
one 0 311 156
for 0 311 156
me, 0 311 156
this 0 311 156
time 0 311 156
concerning 0 311 156
a 0 311 156
second 0 311 156
of 0 311 156
his 0 311 156
protégés, 0 311 156
Cardinal 0 311 156
Donald 0 311 156
Wuerl. 0 311 156

He 0 311 157
asked 0 311 157
me: 0 311 157
“What 0 311 157
is 0 311 157
Cardinal 0 311 157
Wuerl 0 311 157
like, 0 311 157
is 0 311 157
he 0 311 157
good 0 311 157
or 0 311 157
bad?” 0 311 157
I 0 311 157
replied, 0 311 157
“Holy 0 311 157
Father, 0 311 157
I 0 311 157
will 0 311 157
not 0 311 157
tell 0 311 157
you 0 311 157
if 0 311 157
he 0 311 157
is 0 311 157
good 0 311 157
or 0 311 157
bad, 0 311 157
but 0 311 157
I 0 311 157
will 0 311 157
tell 0 311 157
you 0 311 157
two 0 311 157
facts.” 0 311 157
They 0 311 157
are 0 311 157
the 0 311 157
ones 0 311 157
I 0 311 157
have 0 311 157
already 0 311 157
mentioned 0 311 157
above, 0 311 157
which 0 311 157
concern 0 311 157
Wuerl’s 0 311 157
pastoral 1 311 157
carelessness 1 311 157
regarding 0 311 157
the 0 311 157
aberrant 0 311 157
deviations 0 311 157
at 0 311 157
Georgetown 0 311 157
University 0 311 157
and 0 311 157
the 0 311 157
invitation 0 311 157
by 0 311 157
the 0 311 157
Archdiocese 0 311 157
of 0 311 157
Washington 0 311 157
to 0 311 157
young 0 311 157
aspirants 0 311 157
to 0 311 157
the 0 311 157
priesthood 0 311 157
to 0 311 157
a 0 311 157
meeting 0 311 157
with 0 311 157
McCarrick! 0 311 157

Once 0 311 158
again 0 311 158
the 0 311 158
Pope 0 311 158
did 0 311 158
not 0 311 158
show 0 311 158
any 0 311 158
reaction. 0 311 158

It 0 311 159
was 0 311 159
also 0 311 159
clear 0 311 159
that, 0 311 159
from 0 311 159
the 0 311 159
time 0 311 159
of 0 311 159
Pope 0 311 159
Francis’s 0 311 159
election, 0 311 159
McCarrick, 0 311 159
now 0 311 159
free 0 311 159
from 0 311 159
all 0 311 159
constraints, 0 311 159
had 0 311 159
felt 0 311 159
free 0 311 159

Their 0 311 166

Regarding 0 311 167
Cupich, 0 311 167
one 0 311 167
cannot 0 311 167
fail 0 311 167
to 0 311 167
note 0 311 167
his 0 311 167
ostentatious 1 311 167
arrogance, 1 311 167
and 0 311 167
the 0 311 167
insolence 0 311 167
with 0 311 167
which 0 311 167
he 0 311 167
denies 0 311 167
the 0 311 167
evidence 0 311 167
that 0 311 167
is 0 311 167
now 0 311 167
obvious 0 311 167
to 0 311 167
all: 0 311 167
that 0 311 167
80% 0 311 167
of 0 311 167
the 0 311 167
abuses 0 311 167
found 0 311 167
were 0 311 167
committed 0 311 167
against 0 311 167
young 0 311 167
adults 0 311 167
by 0 311 167
homosexuals 0 311 167
who 0 311 167
were 0 311 167
in 0 311 167
a 0 311 167
relationship 0 311 167
of 0 311 167
authority 0 311 167
over 0 311 167
their 0 311 167
victims. 0 311 167

During 0 311 168
the 0 311 168
speech 0 311 168
he 0 311 168
gave 0 311 168
when 0 311 168
he 0 311 168
took 0 311 168
possession 0 311 168
of 0 311 168
the 0 311 168
Chicago 0 311 168
See, 0 311 168
at 0 311 168
which 0 311 168
I 0 311 168
was 0 311 168
present 0 311 168
as 0 311 168
a 0 311 168
representative 0 311 168
of 0 311 168
the 0 311 168
Pope, 0 311 168
Cupich 0 311 168
quipped 0 311 168
that 0 311 168
one 0 311 168
certainly 0 311 168
should 0 311 168
not 0 311 168
expect 0 311 168
the 0 311 168
new 0 311 168
Archbishop 0 311 168
to 0 311 168
walk 0 311 168
on 0 311 168
water. 0 311 168

Perhaps 0 311 169
it 0 311 169
would 0 311 169
be 0 311 169
enough 0 311 169
for 0 311 169
him 0 311 169
to 0 311 169
be 0 311 169
able 0 311 169
to 0 311 169
remain 0 311 169
with 0 311 169
his 0 311 169
feet 0 311 169
on 0 311 169
the 0 311 169
ground 0 311 169
and 0 311 169
not 0 311 169
try 0 311 169
to 0 311 169
turn 0 311 169
reality 0 311 169
upside-down, 0 311 169
blinded 0 311 169
by 0 311 169
his 0 311 169
pro-gay 0 311 169
ideology, 0 311 169
as 0 311 169
he 0 311 169
stated 0 311 169
in 0 311 169
a 0 311 169
recent 0 311 169
interview 0 311 169
with 0 311 169

Extolling 0 311 170
his 0 311 170
particular 0 311 170
expertise 0 311 170
in 0 311 170
the 0 311 170
matter, 0 311 170
having 0 311 170
been 0 311 170
President 0 311 170

Young 0 311 170
People 0 311 170
of 0 311 170
the 0 311 170
USCCB, 0 311 170
he 0 311 170
asserted 0 311 170
that 0 311 170
the 0 311 170
main 0 311 170
problem 0 311 170
in 0 311 170
the 0 311 170
crisis 0 311 170
of 0 311 170
sexual 0 311 170
abuse 0 311 170
by 0 311 170
clergy 0 311 170
is 0 311 170
not 0 311 170
homosexuality, 0 311 170
and 0 311 170
that 0 311 170
affirming 0 311 170
this 0 311 170
is 0 311 170
only 0 311 170
a 0 311 170
way 0 311 170
of 0 311 170
diverting 0 311 170
attention 0 311 170
from 0 311 170
the 0 311 170
real 0 311 170
problem 0 311 170
which 0 311 170
is 0 311 170
clericalism. 0 311 170

In 0 311 171
support 0 311 171
of 0 311 171
this 0 311 171
thesis, 0 311 171
Cupich 0 311 171
“oddly” 0 311 171
made 0 311 171

results 0 311 171
of 0 311 171

carried 0 311 171
out 0 311 171
at 0 311 171
the 0 311 171
height 0 311 171
of 0 311 171
the 0 311 171
sexual 0 311 171
abuse 0 311 171
of 0 311 171

crisis 0 311 171
in 0 311 171
the 0 311 171
early 0 311 171
2000s, 0 311 171
while 0 311 171
he 0 311 171
“candidly” 0 311 171
ignored 0 311 171

the 0 311 171
results 0 311 171
of 0 311 171
that 0 311 171

were 0 311 171
totally 0 311 171
denied 0 311 171

a 0 311 177
sad 0 311 177
recent 0 311 177
example 0 311 177
of 0 311 177

Pope 0 311 178
Francis 0 311 178
has 0 311 178
repeatedly 0 311 178
asked 0 311 178
for 0 311 178
total 0 311 178
transparency 0 311 178
in 0 311 178
the 0 311 178

The 0 311 179
faithful 0 311 179
throughout 0 311 179
the 0 311 179
world 0 311 179
also 0 311 179
demand 0 311 179
this 0 311 179
of 0 311 179
him 0 311 179
in 0 311 179
an 0 311 179
exemplary 0 311 179
manner. 0 311 179

He 0 311 180
must 0 311 180
honestly 0 311 180
state 0 311 180
when 0 311 180
he 0 311 180
first 0 311 180
learned 0 311 180
about 0 311 180
the 0 311 180
crimes 0 311 180
committed 0 311 180
by 0 311 180
McCarrick, 0 311 180
who 0 311 180
abused 0 311 180
his 0 311 180
authority 0 311 180
with 0 311 180
seminarians 0 311 180

priests. 0 311 180

In 0 311 181
any 0 311 181
case, 0 311 181
the 0 311 181
Pope 0 311 181
learned 0 311 181
about 0 311 181
it 0 311 181
from 0 311 181
me 0 311 181
on 0 311 181
June 0 311 181
23, 0 311 181
2013 0 311 181

continued 0 311 181
to 0 311 181
cover 0 311 181
for 0 311 181
him. 0 311 181

He 0 311 182
did 0 311 182
not 0 311 182
take 0 311 182
into 0 311 182
account 0 311 182
the 0 311 182
sanctions 0 311 182
that 0 311 182
Pope 0 311 182
Benedict 0 311 182
had 0 311 182
imposed 0 311 182
on 0 311 182
him 0 311 182
and 0 311 182
made 0 311 182
him 0 311 182
his 0 311 182
trusted 0 311 182
counselor 0 311 182
along 0 311 182
with 0 311 182
Maradiaga. 0 311 182

The 0 311 183
latter 0 311 183
[Maradiaga] 0 311 183
is 0 311 183
so 0 311 183
confident 0 311 183
of 0 311 183
the 0 311 183
Pope’s 0 311 183
protection 0 311 183
that 0 311 183
he 0 311 183
can 0 311 183
dismiss 0 311 183
as 0 311 183
“gossip” 0 311 183
the 0 311 183
heartfelt 0 311 183
appeals 0 311 183
of 0 311 183
dozens 0 311 183
of 0 311 183
his 0 311 183
seminarians, 0 311 183
who 0 311 183
found 0 311 183
the 0 311 183
courage 0 311 183
to 0 311 183
write 0 311 183
to 0 311 183
him 0 311 183
after 0 311 183
one 0 311 183
of 0 311 183
them 0 311 183
tried 0 311 183
to 0 311 183
commit 0 311 183
suicide 0 311 183
over 0 311 183
homosexual 0 311 183
abuse 0 311 183
in 0 311 183
the 0 311 183
seminary. 0 311 183

By 0 311 184
now 0 311 184
the 0 311 184
faithful 0 311 184
have 0 311 184
well 0 311 184
understood 0 311 184
Maradiaga’s 0 311 184
strategy: 0 311 184

the 0 311 184

up 0 311 184
a 0 311 184
chasm 0 311 184
of 0 311 184
abuses 0 311 184
of 0 311 184
power, 0 311 184

in 0 311 185
the 0 311 185

Avvenire: 0 311 185
“It 0 311 185

Pineda 0 311 185

Even 0 311 194
in 0 311 194
the 0 311 194
tragic 0 311 194

of 0 311 194
McCarrick, 0 311 194
Pope 0 311 194

He 0 311 195
knew 0 311 195

least 0 311 195
June 0 311 195

a 0 311 195
serial 1 311 195
predator. 1 311 195

Although 0 311 196
he 0 311 196
knew 0 311 196
that 0 311 196
he 0 311 196
was 0 311 196
a 0 311 196

him 0 311 196
to 0 311 196
the 0 311 196
bitter 0 311 196
end; 0 311 196
indeed, 0 311 196
he 0 311 196
made 0 311 196
McCarrick’s 0 311 196
advice 0 311 196
his 0 311 196
own, 0 311 196
which 0 311 196
was 0 311 196

It 0 311 197
was 0 311 197

we 0 311 214
do 0 311 214
not 0 311 214

evil, 0 311 214
we 0 311 214
tacitly 0 311 214
feed 0 311 214
it. 0 311 214

We 0 311 215
need 0 311 215
to 0 311 215
intervene 0 311 215

this 0 311 215
is 0 311 215
rightly 0 311 215
to 0 311 215

who 0 311 215
in 0 311 215
the 0 311 215
case 0 311 215
of 0 311 215
McCarrick 0 311 215
not 0 311 215
only 0 311 215
did 0 311 215
not 0 311 215

evil 0 311 215

associated 0 311 215
himself 0 311 215

doing 0 311 215
evil 0 311 215
with 0 311 215
someone 0 311 215
he 0 311 215
knew 0 311 215
to 0 311 215
be 0 311 215
deeply 0 311 215
corrupt. 0 311 215

He 0 311 216

of 0 311 216
someone 0 311 216
he 0 311 216

to 0 311 216

Francis 0 311 218

his 0 311 219

he 0 311 219
has 0 311 219

Remember, 0 312 40

Yeah, 0 312 42
well, 0 312 42
that's 1 312 42
about 1 312 42
as 1 312 42
trustworthy 1 312 42
as 1 312 42
the 1 312 42

This 0 312 43
latest 0 312 43
move, 0 312 43
while 0 312 43
welcome, 0 312 43
may 0 312 43
only 0 312 43
be 0 312 43
a 0 312 43
response 0 312 43
to 0 312 43
President 0 312 43
Donald 0 312 43
Trump's 0 312 43
vow 0 312 43
to 0 312 43
"get 0 312 43
involved." 0 312 43

However, 1 312 44
I 1 312 44
ask, 1 312 44
why 1 312 44
were 1 312 44
you 1 312 44
not 1 312 44
involved 1 312 44
in 1 312 44
the 1 312 44
first 1 312 44
place, 1 312 44
Mr. 1 312 44
President? 1 312 44

According 1 312 45
to 1 312 45
the 1 312 45
Constitution, 1 312 45
you, 1 312 45
and 1 312 45
you 1 312 45
alone, 1 312 45
are 1 312 45
the 1 312 45
sole 1 312 45
head 1 312 45
of 1 312 45
the 1 312 45
executive 1 312 45
branch, 1 312 45
and 1 312 45
as 1 312 45
such 1 312 45
you 1 312 45
are 1 312 45
where 1 312 45
the 1 312 45
buck 1 312 45
stop 1 312 45
in 1 312 45
making 1 312 45
sure 1 312 45
the 1 312 45
laws 1 312 45
are 1 312 45
faithfully 1 312 45
executed. 1 312 45

So, 0 312 46
if 0 312 46
Trump 0 312 46
is 0 312 46
going 0 312 46
to 0 312 46
fire 0 312 46
Sessions, 0 312 46
perhaps 1 312 46
he 1 312 46
should 1 312 46
stop 1 312 46
talking 1 312 46
about 1 312 46
it 1 312 46
and 1 312 46
get 1 312 46
to 1 312 46
it 1 312 46
and 1 312 46
actually 1 312 46
put 1 312 46
someone 1 312 46
in 1 312 46
the 1 312 46
Justice 1 312 46
Department 1 312 46
as 1 312 46
attorney 1 312 46
general 1 312 46
who 1 312 46
will 1 312 46
do 1 312 46
the 1 312 46
job 1 312 46
faithfully, 1 312 46
and 1 312 46
by 1 312 46
that, 1 312 46
I 1 312 46
don't 1 312 46
mean 1 312 46
Trey 1 312 46
Gowdy. 1 312 46

I 1 312 47
mean 1 312 47
someone 1 312 47
who 1 312 47
is 1 312 47
serious 1 312 47
about 1 312 47
justice, 1 312 47
not 1 312 47
political 1 312 47
grandstanding 1 312 47
or 1 312 47
covering 1 312 47
up 1 312 47
criminal 1 312 47
activity. 1 312 47

Until 0 312 48
then, 0 312 48
I'll 0 312 48
consider 0 312 48
this 0 312 48
the 0 312 48

this 0 313 16
just 0 313 16
recently, 0 313 16
when 0 313 16
Mountain 0 313 16

out 0 313 16
the 0 313 16

profession 0 313 16
of 0 313 16
faith 0 313 16
(shahada), 0 313 16
ostensibly 0 313 16
as 0 313 16
a 0 313 16
calligraphy 0 313 16
exercise. 0 313 16

Parent 0 313 17
Rich 0 313 17
Penkoski 0 313 17
recounted: 0 313 17
“I 0 313 17
saw 0 313 17
the 0 313 17
assignment 0 313 17
of 0 313 17
writing 0 313 17
the 0 313 17
Shahada 0 313 17
in 0 313 17
Arabic. 0 313 17

Their 0 313 18
excuse 0 313 18
was 0 313 18
calligraphy. 0 313 18

I 0 313 19
was 0 313 19
like, 0 313 19
‘Whoa! 1 313 19

Whoa! 1 313 20

Whoa!’ 1 313 21
First 0 313 21
of 0 313 21
all, 0 313 21
calligraphy 0 313 21
was 0 313 21
invented 0 313 21
in 0 313 21
China 0 313 21
3,000 0 313 21
years 0 313 21
prior 0 313 21
to 0 313 21
Muhammad. 0 313 21

The 0 313 22
fact 0 313 22
that 0 313 22
they 0 313 22
were 0 313 22
trying 0 313 22
to 0 313 22
get 0 313 22
my 0 313 22
daughter 0 313 22
to 0 313 22
write 0 313 22
that 0 313 22
disturbed 0 313 22
me. 0 313 22

I 0 313 23
said, 0 313 23
‘That 0 313 23
is 0 313 23
not 0 313 23
happening. 0 313 23

My 0 313 24
daughter 0 313 24
is 0 313 24
not 0 313 24
doing 0 313 24
that.’ 0 313 24
My 0 313 24
daughter 0 313 24
told 0 313 24
me 0 313 24
that 0 313 24
if 0 313 24
she 0 313 24
didn’t 0 313 24
do 0 313 24
the 0 313 24
assignment, 0 313 24
then 0 313 24
she 0 313 24
was 0 313 24
going 0 313 24
to 0 313 24
get 0 313 24
a 0 313 24
[detention] 0 313 24
slip.” 0 313 24

Branch 0 313 25
contradicted 0 313 25
Penkoski, 0 313 25
claiming: 0 313 25
“The 0 313 25
teacher 0 313 25
has 0 313 25
told 0 313 25
her 0 313 25
class 0 313 25
several 0 313 25
times 0 313 25
that 0 313 25
this 0 313 25
is 0 313 25
a 0 313 25
study 0 313 25
of 0 313 25
world 0 313 25
religions 0 313 25
and 0 313 25
that 0 313 25
she 0 313 25
is 0 313 25
not 0 313 25
trying 0 313 25
to 0 313 25
advocate 0 313 25
for 0 313 25
any 0 313 25
religion 0 313 25
over 0 313 25
another. 0 313 25

She 0 313 26
has 0 313 26
told 0 313 26
her 0 313 26
class 0 313 26
that 0 313 26
if 0 313 26
they 0 313 26
had 0 313 26
questions 0 313 26
about 0 313 26
religious 0 313 26
beliefs, 0 313 26
that 0 313 26
those 0 313 26
conversations 0 313 26
should 0 313 26
take 0 313 26
place 0 313 26
with 0 313 26
their 0 313 26
parents.” 0 313 26
He 0 313 26
said 0 313 26
that 0 313 26
Christianity 0 313 26
and 0 313 26
Judaism 0 313 26
were 0 313 26
given 0 313 26
“equitable 0 313 26
treatment” 0 313 26
in 0 313 26
the 0 313 26
same 0 313 26
class. 0 313 26

Penkoski’s 0 313 27
daughter, 0 313 27
Brielle, 0 313 27
however, 0 313 27
said 0 313 27
that 0 313 27
the 0 313 27
class 0 313 27
spent 0 313 27
much 0 313 27
less 0 313 27
time 0 313 27
on 0 313 27
Christianity 0 313 27
and 0 313 27
Judaism 0 313 27
than 0 313 27
it 0 313 27
did 0 313 27
on 0 313 27
Islam. 0 313 27

Penkoski 0 313 28
pointed 0 313 28
out 0 313 28
that 0 313 28
the 0 313 28
accompanying 0 313 28
exercises 0 313 28
were 0 313 28
also 0 313 28
less 0 313 28
extensive 0 313 28
for 0 313 28
Christianity 0 313 28
and 0 313 28
Judaism 0 313 28
than 0 313 28
they 0 313 28
were 0 313 28
for 0 313 28
Islam: 0 313 28
“Notice 0 313 28

to 0 313 45
compete 0 313 45
in 0 313 45
a 0 313 45
global 0 313 45
society, 0 313 45
not 0 313 45

Porterfield, 0 313 45
however, 0 313 45
shot 0 313 45
back: 0 313 45
“They 0 313 45

So 0 313 46
for 0 313 46
the 0 313 46

to 0 313 46
have 0 313 46

it 0 313 46
does 0 313 46
seem 0 313 46
like 0 313 46
it 0 313 46
is 0 313 46
indoctrination.” 1 313 46

None 0 313 47
of 0 313 47
the 0 313 47
encroachments 0 313 47
of 0 313 47
Islam 0 313 47
in 0 313 47
public 0 313 47

should 0 313 47
come 0 313 47

any 0 313 47
real 0 313 47
surprise. 0 313 47

Multiculturalism, 0 313 48
after 0 313 48
all, 0 313 48
amounts 0 313 48
to 0 313 48
respect 0 313 48
for 0 313 48
every 0 313 48
culture 0 313 48
except 0 313 48
one’s 0 313 48
own. 0 313 48

The 0 313 49
embarrassment, 0 313 49
regret, 0 313 49
and 0 313 49
even 0 313 49
self-hatred 0 313 49
that 0 313 49
has 0 313 49
been 0 313 49
inculcated 0 313 49
in 0 313 49
American 0 313 49
public 0 313 49
school 0 313 49
students 0 313 49
for 0 313 49
decades 0 313 49
now 0 313 49
has 0 313 49
created 0 313 49
a 0 313 49
vacuum, 0 313 49
which 0 313 49
Muslims 0 313 49
have 0 313 49
shown 0 313 49
themselves 0 313 49
to 0 313 49
be 0 313 49
all 0 313 49
too 0 313 49
eager 0 313 49
to 0 313 49
fill. 0 313 49

Certainly, 0 313 50
those 0 313 50
who 0 313 50
are 0 313 50
furthering 0 313 50
the 0 313 50
Islamization 0 313 50
of 0 313 50
the 0 313 50

would 0 313 50
deny 0 313 50
that 0 313 50
they 0 313 50
would 0 313 50
like 0 313 50
to 0 313 50
see 0 313 50
Islamic 0 313 50
law 0 313 50
implemented 0 313 50
in 0 313 50
the 0 313 50
United 0 313 50
States, 0 313 50
and 0 313 50
would 0 313 50
indignantly 0 313 50
reject 0 313 50
the 0 313 50
claim 0 313 50
that 0 313 50
their 0 313 50
efforts 0 313 50
were 0 313 50
furthering 0 313 50
that 0 313 50
end 0 313 50
in 0 313 50
any 0 313 50
way. 0 313 50

They 0 313 51
would 0 313 51
say 0 313 51
that 0 313 51
they 0 313 51
are 0 313 51
doing 0 313 51
it 0 313 51
all 0 313 51
for 0 313 51
tolerance, 0 313 51
pluralism, 0 313 51
and 0 313 51
multiculturalism. 0 313 51

Unfortunately, 0 313 52
in 0 313 52
the 0 313 52
end, 0 313 52
it 0 313 52
amounts 0 313 52

as 1 323 7
well 1 323 7
as 1 323 7
civilians. 1 323 7

We 0 323 8
know 0 323 8
that 0 323 8
Kazi, 0 323 8
with 0 323 8
all 0 323 8

was 0 323 8
clearly 0 323 8
trying 0 323 8
to 0 323 8
set 0 323 8
off 0 323 8
a 0 323 8

that 0 323 8
would 0 323 8

himself. 0 323 8

Even 0 323 9
if 0 323 9

the 0 323 9

a 0 323 9
car 0 323 9
full 0 323 9
of 0 323 9
incendiaries, 0 323 9
probably 0 323 9
this 0 323 9
has 0 323 9
something 0 323 9
to 0 323 9
do 0 323 9
with 0 323 9
the 0 323 9
global 0 323 9
jihad. 0 323 9

The 0 323 10
FBI’s 0 323 10
bafflement 0 323 10
here 0 323 10
is 0 323 10
part 0 323 10
of 0 323 10
its 0 323 10
deep, 0 323 10
deep 0 323 10
corruption. 0 323 10

The 0 323 11
FBI 0 323 11
doesn’t 0 323 11
acknowledge 0 323 11
that 0 323 11
there 0 323 11
is 0 323 11
a 0 323 11
global 0 323 11
jihad, 0 323 11
or 0 323 11
that 0 323 11
Islam 0 323 11
has 0 323 11
anything 0 323 11
to 0 323 11
do 0 323 11
with 0 323 11
terrorism. 0 323 11

It 0 323 12
doesn’t 0 323 12
admit 0 323 12
that 0 323 12
there 0 323 12
is 0 323 12
a 0 323 12
war 0 323 12
going 0 323 12
on, 0 323 12
and 0 323 12
treats 0 323 12
each 0 323 12
act 0 323 12
of 0 323 12
Islamic 0 323 12
terror 0 323 12
as 0 323 12
if 0 323 12
it 0 323 12
were 0 323 12
a 0 323 12
separate 0 323 12
and 0 323 12
discrete 0 323 12
criminal 0 323 12
event, 0 323 12
unrelated 0 323 12
to 0 323 12
all 0 323 12
the 0 323 12
others. 0 323 12

So, 0 323 13
each 0 323 13
time 0 323 13
something 0 323 13
like 0 323 13
this 0 323 13
happens, 0 323 13

trying 0 323 13
to 0 323 13

It’s 0 323 14
as 0 323 14
if 0 323 14
the 0 323 14
U.S. 0 323 14

if 0 323 14
each 0 323 14
one’s 0 323 14

had 0 323 14
anything 0 323 14

This 0 323 15
willful 0 323 15
ignorance 0 323 15
leads 0 323 15
to 0 323 15
a 0 323 15

The 0 329 2
department 0 329 2
is 0 329 2
now 0 329 2
accused 0 329 2
of 0 329 2
trying 0 329 2
to 0 329 2
“smear” 1 329 2
Jean 0 329 2
by 0 329 2
claiming 0 329 2
they 0 329 2
found 0 329 2
a 0 329 2
tiny 1 329 2
bit 1 329 2
of 0 329 2
marijuana 0 329 2
in 0 329 2
his 0 329 2
house—as 0 329 2
if 0 329 2
this 0 329 2
justifies 0 329 2
going 0 329 2
into 0 329 2
someone’s 0 329 2
home 0 329 2
and 0 329 2
murdering 0 329 2
them. 0 329 2

The 0 329 3
timing 0 329 3
couldn’t 0 329 3
have 0 329 3

police 0 329 3
released 0 329 3
the 0 329 3
affidavit 0 329 3
on 0 329 3
the 0 329 3
day 0 329 3

having 0 329 3
allegedly 0 329 3
found 0 329 3
the 0 329 3
marijuana 0 329 3
last 0 329 3
week. 0 329 3

According 0 329 4
to 0 329 4
the 0 329 4
affidavit, 0 329 4
when 0 329 4
they 0 329 4
searched 0 329 4
his 0 329 4
home, 0 329 4
police 0 329 4

to 0 329 4
have 0 329 4
found 0 329 4
10.4 0 329 4
grams 0 329 4

than 0 329 4
half 0 329 4
an 0 329 4
ounce. 0 329 4

Police 0 329 5
also 0 329 5
said 0 329 5
they 0 329 5
found 0 329 5

Even 1 329 6
if 1 329 6

in 0 329 22

is 0 329 23

“Due 0 329 32

Upon 0 329 33
being 0 329 33

verbal 0 329 35
commands 0 329 35
she 0 329 35
did 0 329 35

entirely 0 329 35

Attempting 0 329 36
to 0 329 36

that 0 329 36
Jean 0 329 36

at 0 329 38
an 0 329 38

I’m 0 329 38

that 0 329 38
I’m 0 329 38
at 0 329 38

I 0 329 38

to 0 329 45

according 0 329 45
to 0 329 45
witnesses, 0 329 45
Guyger’s 0 329 45
story 0 329 45
of 0 329 45
inserting 0 329 45
the 0 329 45
key 0 329 45

door 0 329 45
and 0 329 45
it 0 329 45
opening 0 329 45
up 0 329 45
was 0 329 45
simply 0 329 45
not 0 329 45
true. 0 329 45

According 0 329 46
to 0 329 46
witnesses, 0 329 46
Guyger 0 329 46
was 0 329 46
banging 0 329 46
on 0 329 46

“Independent 0 329 47

The 0 329 49

This 0 329 50
was 0 329 50

attorneys 0 329 50

opened 0 329 50

released 0 329 50
it 0 329 50
several 0 329 50
times—showing 0 329 50
that 0 329 50
it 0 329 50
closed 0 329 50
every 0 329 50

the 0 329 50
claim 0 329 50
that 0 329 50
the 0 329 50

out 0 329 50

Jean’s 0 329 51

also 0 329 51
pointed 0 329 51
out 0 329 51
that 0 329 51
it 0 329 51
would 0 329 51
have 0 329 51

upstanding 1 329 54

of 1 329 54

“What’s 0 330 4
often 0 330 4
called 0 330 4
political 0 330 4
correctness 0 330 4
is 0 330 4
politeness,” 0 330 4
Clinton 0 330 4
said. 0 330 4

“It’s 0 330 5
not 0 330 5
being 0 330 5
rude 0 330 5
and 0 330 5
insulting 0 330 5
to 0 330 5
people. 0 330 5

It’s 0 330 6
respecting 0 330 6
the 0 330 6
diversity 0 330 6
that 0 330 6
we 0 330 6
have 0 330 6
in 0 330 6
our 0 330 6
society,” 0 330 6
she 0 330 6
said. 0 330 6

“The 0 330 7
Democratic 0 330 7
Party 0 330 7
is 0 330 7
a 0 330 7
much 0 330 7
more 0 330 7
diverse 0 330 7
political 0 330 7
party, 0 330 7
attracting 0 330 7
people 0 330 7
who 0 330 7
are 0 330 7
African-American, 0 330 7
Latino, 0 330 7
LGBT, 0 330 7
whatever 0 330 7
the 0 330 7
reason 0 330 7
why 0 330 7
people 0 330 7
feel 0 330 7
more 0 330 7
comfortable 0 330 7
where 0 330 7
they 0 330 7
are 0 330 7
taken 0 330 7
in, 0 330 7
where 0 330 7
they 0 330 7
are 0 330 7
included 0 330 7
as 0 330 7
part 0 330 7
of 0 330 7
a 0 330 7
political 0 330 7
movement 0 330 7
or 0 330 7
party.” 0 330 7
“And 0 330 7
I 0 330 7
don’t 0 330 7
think 0 330 7
it’s 0 330 7
politically 0 330 7
correct 0 330 7
to 0 330 7
say 0 330 7
we 0 330 7
value 0 330 7
that. 0 330 7

And 0 330 8
I 0 330 8
don’t 0 330 8
want 0 330 8
to 0 330 8
go 0 330 8
around 0 330 8
insulting 0 330 8
people. 0 330 8

I 0 330 9
don’t 0 330 9
want 0 330 9
to 0 330 9
paint 0 330 9
with 0 330 9
a 0 330 9
broad 0 330 9
brush 0 330 9
every 0 330 9
immigrant 0 330 9
is 0 330 9
this, 0 330 9
every 0 330 9

with 0 330 9
different 0 330 9

beliefs 0 330 9
or 0 330 9
whatever 0 330 9
– 0 330 9
that’s 1 330 9
childish.” 1 330 9

Childish, 1 330 10
indeed. 1 330 10

Insulting, 1 330 11
indeed. 1 330 11

Just 0 330 12
30 0 330 12
seconds 0 330 12
later, 0 330 12
as 0 330 12
Swisher 0 330 12
asked: 0 330 12

“what 0 330 13
do 0 330 13
you 0 330 13
think 0 330 13
of 0 330 13
Cory 0 330 13
Booker… 0 330 13
saying 0 330 13
‘kick 1 330 13
them 1 330 13
in 1 330 13
the 1 330 13
shins,’ 1 330 13
essentially…” 0 330 13
incorrectly 0 330 13
recalling 0 330 13
Eric 0 330 13
Holder’s 0 330 13
recent 0 330 13
comments. 0 330 13

Which 0 330 14
Clinton 0 330 14
quickly 0 330 14
corrected: 0 330 14

“Well 0 330 15
that 0 330 15
was 0 330 15
Eric 0 330 15
Holder…” 0 330 15

Adding, 0 330 16
rather 1 330 16
extraordinarily, 1 330 16

“Yeah, 0 330 17
I 0 330 17
know 0 330 17
they 0 330 17
all 0 330 17
look 0 330 17
alike,” 0 330 17
Clinton 0 330 17
joked, 0 330 17
triggering 0 330 17
howls 0 330 17
of 0 330 17
laughter 0 330 17
from 0 330 17
the 0 330 17
apparently 0 330 17
mind-numbed 0 330 17
audience. 0 330 17

Sorry 1 330 18
Hillary, 1 330 18
we 1 330 18
don’t 1 330 18
think 1 330 18
they 1 330 18
look 1 330 18
anything 1 330 18
alike. 1 330 18

Or 1 330 19
did 1 330 19
you 1 330 19
mean 1 330 19
all 1 330 19
black 1 330 19
people? 1 330 19

Finally, 0 330 20
we 0 330 20
have 0 330 20
one 0 330 20
question 0 330 20
– 0 330 20
what 0 330 20
would 0 330 20
have 0 330 20
happened 0 330 20
if 0 330 20
Trump 0 330 20
said 0 330 20
it? 0 330 20

American 1 330 21
Mirror’s 1 330 21
Kyle 1 330 21
Olsen 1 330 21

so 1 330 21
eloquently, 1 330 21
Hillary 1 330 21
Clinton 1 330 21
appears 1 330 21
to 1 330 21
benefit 1 330 21
from 1 330 21
her 1 330 21
progressive 1 330 21

– 1 330 21
it 1 330 21
is 1 330 21
the 1 330 21
only 1 330 21
thing 1 330 21
that 1 330 21
protects 1 330 21
her 1 330 21
from 1 330 21
getting 1 330 21
the 1 330 21
‘Roseanne 1 330 21
treatment’, 1 330 21
and 1 330 21
not 1 330 21

Flashback 0 334 1

2004, 0 334 1

up 0 334 1
until 0 334 1

Barack 0 334 1

couldn’t 0 334 1

during 0 334 2

2004 0 334 2
campaign 0 334 2
for 0 334 2
the 0 334 2

his 0 334 2

in 0 334 2
Chicago 0 334 2
somehow 0 334 2

unseal 0 334 2
the 0 334 2

of 0 334 2

Jack 0 334 2

who 0 334 2
was 0 334 2
leading 0 334 2
by 0 334 2
a 0 334 2
large 0 334 2
margin. 0 334 2

The 0 334 3
Ryan 0 334 3

records 0 334 3
were 0 334 3
sealed 0 334 3

both 0 334 3

But 0 334 4
the 0 334 4

got 0 334 4
them 0 334 4

“This 0 334 28

Tuesday 0 334 32
that 0 334 32
the 0 334 32
party’s 0 334 32
investigation 0 334 32
of 0 334 32
the 0 334 32
allegations 0 334 32
against 0 334 32
Ellison 0 334 32
will 0 334 32
be 0 334 32
finished 0 334 32
soon, 0 334 32
then 0 334 32
released 0 334 32
to 0 334 32
the 0 334 32
public. 0 334 32

An 0 334 33
external 0 334 33
investigator 0 334 33
was 0 334 33
hired 0 334 33
to 0 334 33
conduct 0 334 33
the 0 334 33
inquiry. 0 334 33

The 0 334 34
Star 0 334 34
Tribune 0 334 34
argued 0 334 34
that, 0 334 34
given 0 334 34
the 0 334 34
public 0 334 34

around 0 334 34
that 0 334 34

her 0 334 34
ex-husband, 0 334 34
the 0 334 34
divorce 0 334 34
records 0 334 34
are 0 334 34
a 0 334 34
matter 0 334 34
of 0 334 34
concern 0 334 34
to 0 334 34
voters. 0 334 34

Divorce 0 334 35
records 0 334 35
are 0 334 35
typically 0 334 35
public, 0 334 35
but 0 334 35
judges 0 334 35
will 0 334 35
often 0 334 35
agree 0 334 35
to 0 334 35
seal 0 334 35
them 0 334 35
if 0 334 35
both 0 334 35
parties 0 334 35
to 0 334 35
the 0 334 35
case 0 334 35
agree 0 334 35
and 0 334 35
no 0 334 35
one 0 334 35
else 0 334 35
objects. 0 334 35

The 0 334 36
Ellison 0 334 36
campaign 0 334 36
released 0 334 36
a 0 334 36
statement 0 334 36
from 0 334 36
Kim 0 334 36
Ellison 0 334 36
on 0 334 36
behalf 0 334 36
of 0 334 36
both 0 334 36
her 0 334 36
and 0 334 36
Keith 0 334 36
Ellison. 0 334 36

“Our 0 334 37
divorce 0 334 37
simply 0 334 37
isn’t 0 334 37
the 0 334 37

business, 0 334 37
and 0 334 37
therefore, 0 334 37
when 0 334 37
we 0 334 37
separated, 0 334 37
we 0 334 37
jointly 0 334 37

At 0 335 9
a 0 335 9

Saris 0 335 9
expressed 0 335 9
concern 0 335 9
that 0 335 9
ICE 0 335 9
had 0 335 9
broken 0 335 9
its 0 335 9
word 0 335 9
with 0 335 9
Rombot 0 335 9
after 0 335 9
telling 0 335 9
him 0 335 9
in 0 335 9
2015 0 335 9
that 0 335 9
he 0 335 9
would 0 335 9
"be 0 335 9
given 0 335 9
an 0 335 9
opportunity 0 335 9

orderly 0 335 9
departure" 0 335 9
before 0 335 9
being 0 335 9
deported. 0 335 9

She 0 335 10
also 0 335 10
expressed 0 335 10
concern 0 335 10
he 0 335 10
was 0 335 10
being 0 335 10
held 0 335 10
alongside 0 335 10
potentially 0 335 10
violent 0 335 10
criminals. 0 335 10

Her 0 335 11
problem 0 335 11
though 0 335 11
was 0 335 11
that 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
law 0 335 11
and 0 335 11
precedent 0 335 11
are 0 335 11
on 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
side 0 335 11
of 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
continued 0 335 11
deportation 0 335 11
of 0 335 11
aliens. 0 335 11

Kritarch 0 335 12
Saris 0 335 12
has 0 335 12
apparently 0 335 12
seen 0 335 12
the 0 335 12
SCOTUS 0 335 12
writing 0 335 12
on 0 335 12
the 0 335 12
wall, 0 335 12
and 0 335 12
perhaps 0 335 12
had 1 335 12
an 1 335 12
attack 1 335 12
of 1 335 12
her 1 335 12
legal 1 335 12
conscience 1 335 12
and 0 335 12
decided 0 335 12
that 0 335 12
she 0 335 12
will 0 335 12
acquiesce 0 335 12
on 0 335 12
the 0 335 12
major 0 335 12
issue, 0 335 12
but 0 335 12
fight 0 335 12
on 0 335 12
a 0 335 12
minor 0 335 12
issue. 0 335 12

this 0 335 13
the 0 335 13
pattern 0 335 13
of 0 335 13

Saris 0 335 14
has 0 335 14
apparently 0 335 14
decided 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
bend 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
inevitable 0 335 14
in 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
case 0 335 14
of 0 335 14

appeals, 0 335 14
all 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
naught, 0 335 14
but 0 335 14
do 0 335 14
a 0 335 14
little 0 335 14
sabotage 0 335 14
instead.However, 0 335 14
she 1 335 14
will 1 335 14
not 1 335 14
let 1 335 14
it 1 335 14
go 1 335 14
quietly 1 335 14
into 1 335 14

night.What 1 335 14
we 0 335 14
have 0 335 14
here 0 335 14
is 0 335 14
that 0 335 14
Saris 0 335 14
realized 0 335 14
she 0 335 14
has 0 335 14
no 0 335 14
authority 0 335 14
over 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
deportation 0 335 14
of 0 335 14

but 0 335 14
she 0 335 14
will 0 335 14
do 0 335 14
her 0 335 14
best 0 335 14
to 0 335 14
throw 1 335 14
a 1 335 14

not 0 335 14

would 0 337 19

personal 1 337 19

Their 1 337 20

enlisted 0 337 20

I 0 337 22
call 0 337 22
them 0 337 22
Vichy 1 337 22
journalists 1 337 22
— 0 337 22
after 1 337 22
the 1 337 22
Vichy 1 337 22
government 1 337 22
that 1 337 22
served 1 337 22
and 1 337 22
enabled 1 337 22
the 1 337 22
German 1 337 22
occupation 1 337 22
of 1 337 22
wartime 1 337 22
France. 1 337 22

Last 0 337 23
October, 0 337 23
the 0 337 23
Australian 0 337 23
Broadcasting 0 337 23
Corporation 0 337 23
journalist 0 337 23
Sarah 0 337 23
Ferguson 0 337 23
interviewed 0 337 23
Hillary 0 337 23
Clinton, 0 337 23
over 1 337 23
whom 1 337 23
she 1 337 23
fawned 1 337 23
as 0 337 23
“the 1 337 23
icon 1 337 23
for 1 337 23
your 1 337 23
generation”. 1 337 23

This 0 337 24
was 0 337 24
the 0 337 24
same 0 337 24
Clinton 0 337 24
who 0 337 24
threatened 0 337 24
to 0 337 24
“obliterate 1 337 24
totally” 1 337 24
Iran 0 337 24
and, 0 337 24
who, 0 337 24
as 0 337 24
U.S. 0 337 24
secretary 0 337 24
of 0 337 24
State 0 337 24
in 0 337 24
2011, 0 337 24
was 0 337 24
one 1 337 24
of 1 337 24
the 1 337 24
instigators 1 337 24
of 1 337 24
the 1 337 24
invasion 1 337 24
and 1 337 24
destruction 1 337 24
of 1 337 24
Libya 1 337 24
as 1 337 24
a 1 337 24
modern 1 337 24
state, 1 337 24
with 0 337 24
the 0 337 24
loss 0 337 24
of 0 337 24
40,000 0 337 24
lives. 0 337 24

Like 1 337 25
the 1 337 25
invasion 1 337 25
of 1 337 25
Iraq, 1 337 25
it 1 337 25
was 1 337 25
based 1 337 25
on 1 337 25
lies. 1 337 25

When 0 337 26
the 0 337 26
Libyan 0 337 26
President 0 337 26
was 0 337 26
murdered 1 337 26
publicly 1 337 26
and 1 337 26
gruesomely 1 337 26
with 0 337 26
a 0 337 26
knife, 0 337 26
Clinton 0 337 26
was 0 337 26
filmed 0 337 26
whooping 1 337 26
and 1 337 26
cheering. 1 337 26

Thanks 1 337 27
largely 1 337 27
to 1 337 27
her, 1 337 27
Libya 1 337 27
became 1 337 27
a 1 337 27
breeding 1 337 27
ground 1 337 27
for 1 337 27
ISIS 1 337 27
and 1 337 27
other 1 337 27
jihadists. 1 337 27

Seven 0 337 75

as 0 337 77

the 0 337 77

she 1 337 78
could 1 337 78
not 1 337 78
do 1 337 78
this: 1 337 78
that 1 337 78
Assange 1 337 78
had 1 337 78
committed 1 337 78
no 1 337 78
crime: 1 337 78
that 1 337 78
WikiLeaks 1 337 78
was 1 337 78
a 1 337 78
publisher, 1 337 78
whose 1 337 78

anything 0 337 82
to 0 337 82
remember 0 337 82
Gillard 0 337 82
by, 0 337 82
it 0 337 82
a 0 337 82
warmongering, 1 337 82
sycophantic, 1 337 82
embarrassing 1 337 82
speech 1 337 82

made 0 337 82
to 0 337 82
the 0 337 82
US 0 337 82
Congress 0 337 82
soon 0 337 82

Australia. 0 337 83

Julian 0 337 84
Assange’s 0 337 84
father 0 337 84
has 0 337 84
written 0 337 84
to 0 337 84
Turnbull. 0 337 84

It 0 337 85
is 0 337 85
a 0 337 85
moving 0 337 85
letter, 0 337 85
in 0 337 85
which 0 337 85
he 0 337 85
has 0 337 85
appealed 0 337 85
to 0 337 85
the 0 337 85
prime 0 337 85

to 0 337 85
bring 0 337 85

refers 0 337 86
to 0 337 86
the 0 337 86
real 0 337 86
possibility 0 337 86
of 0 337 86
a 0 337 86
tragedy. 0 337 86

I 0 337 87
have 0 337 87
watched 0 337 87
Assange’s 0 337 87
health 0 337 87
deteriorate 0 337 87

years 0 337 87

confinement 0 337 87
without 0 337 87

He 0 337 88
has 0 337 88
had 0 337 88
a 0 337 88
relentless 0 337 88
cough, 0 337 88
but 0 337 88
is 0 337 88
not 0 337 88
even 0 337 88
allowed 0 337 88
safe 0 337 88
passage 0 337 88
to 0 337 88

from 0 337 88
a 0 337 88

for 0 337 88
an 0 337 88

Malcolm 1 337 89
Turnbull 1 337 89
can 1 337 89
remain 1 337 89
silent. 1 337 89

Or 1 337 90
he 1 337 90
can 1 337 90
seize 1 337 90
this 1 337 90
opportunity 1 337 90
and 1 337 90
use 1 337 90
his 1 337 90
government’s 1 337 90

to 1 337 90
defend 1 337 90

life 1 337 90
of 1 337 90
an 1 337 90

It 0 338 21

The 0 338 28
Guardian 0 338 28
piece 0 338 28
came 0 338 28
at 0 338 28
a 0 338 28
critical 0 338 28
moment. 0 338 28

Currently 0 338 29

U.S. 0 338 29
authorities. 0 338 29

On 0 338 30
Monday 0 338 30
special 0 338 30
counsel 0 338 30
Robert 0 338 30
Mueller 0 338 30
said 0 338 30
Manafort 0 338 30
lied 0 338 30
to 0 338 30
investigators, 0 338 30
violating 0 338 30
his 0 338 30
recent 0 338 30
plea 0 338 30
deal. 0 338 30

The 0 338 31
new 0 338 31
sensational 1 338 31
claim 1 338 31
was 0 338 31
immediately 0 338 31
picked 0 338 31
up 0 338 31
by 0 338 31
prominent 0 338 31
reporters 0 338 31
and 0 338 31
major 0 338 31
main 0 338 31
stream 0 338 31
outlets. 0 338 31

They 0 338 32
distributed 0 338 32
is 0 338 32
as 0 338 32
a 0 338 32
factual 0 338 32
account. 0 338 32

It 0 338 33
is 0 338 33
likely 0 338 33
that 0 338 33
millions 0 338 33
of 0 338 33
people 0 338 33
took 0 338 33
note 0 338 33
of 0 338 33
its 0 338 33
claim. 0 338 33

But 1 338 34
several 1 338 34
people 1 338 34
who 1 338 34
had 1 338 34
followed 1 338 34
the 1 338 34
Russiagate 1 338 34
fairytale 1 338 34
and 1 338 34
the 1 338 34
Mueller 1 338 34
investigation 1 338 34
were 1 338 34
immediately 1 338 34
suspicious 1 338 34
of 1 338 34
the 1 338 34
Guardian 1 338 34
claim. 1 338 34

The 1 338 35
story 1 338 35
was 1 338 35
weakly 1 338 35
sourced 1 338 35
and 1 338 35
included 1 338 35
some 1 338 35
details 1 338 35
that 1 338 35
seemed 1 338 35
unlikely 1 338 35
to 1 338 35
be 1 338 35
true. 1 338 35

Glenn 0 338 36
Greenwald 0 338 36
noted 0 338 36
that 0 338 36
the 0 338 36
Ecuadorian 0 338 36
embassy 0 338 36
is 0 338 36
under 0 338 36
heavy 0 338 36
CCTV 0 338 36
surveillance. 0 338 36

There 0 338 37
are 0 338 37
several 0 338 37
guards, 0 338 37
and 0 338 37
visitors 0 338 37
have 0 338 37
to 0 338 37
provide 0 338 37
their 0 338 37
identity 0 338 37
to 0 338 37
enter 0 338 37
it. 0 338 37

Every 0 338 38
visit 0 338 38
is 0 338 38
logged. 0 338 38

If 0 338 39
Manafort 0 338 39
had 0 338 39
really 0 338 39
visited 0 338 39
Assange, 0 338 39
it 0 338 39
would 0 338 39
have 0 338 39
long 0 338 39
been 0 338 39
known: 0 338 39

In 1 338 40
sum, 1 338 40
the 1 338 40
Guardian 1 338 40
published 1 338 40
a 1 338 40
story 1 338 40
today 1 338 40
that 1 338 40
it 1 338 40
knew 1 338 40
would 1 338 40
explode 1 338 40
into 1 338 40
all 1 338 40
sorts 1 338 40
of 1 338 40
viral 1 338 40
benefits 1 338 40
for 1 338 40
the 1 338 40
paper 1 338 40
and 1 338 40
its 1 338 40
reporters 1 338 40
even 1 338 40
though 1 338 40
there 1 338 40
are 1 338 40

The 0 338 43
people 0 338 43
who 0 338 43
promote 0 338 43
the 1 338 43
"Russian 1 338 43
influence" 1 338 43
nonsense 1 338 43
are 0 338 43
political 1 338 43
operatives 1 338 43
or 1 338 43
hacks. 1 338 43

Take 1 338 44
for 1 338 44
example 1 338 44
Luke 1 338 44
Harding 1 338 44
of 1 338 44
the 1 338 44
Guardian 1 338 44
who 1 338 44
just 1 338 44
published 1 338 44
a 1 338 44
book 1 338 44
titled 1 338 44
Collusion: 1 338 44
Secret 1 338 44
Meetings, 1 338 44
Dirty 1 338 44
Money, 1 338 44
and 1 338 44
How 1 338 44
Russia 1 338 44
Helped 1 338 44
Donald 1 338 44
Trump 1 338 44
Win. 1 338 44

He 1 338 45
was 1 338 45
taken 1 338 45
apart 1 338 45
in 1 338 45
a 1 338 45
Real 1 338 45
News 1 338 45
interview 1 338 45
(vid) 1 338 45
about 1 338 45
the 1 338 45
book. 1 338 45

The 1 338 46
interviewer 1 338 46
pointed 1 338 46
out 1 338 46
that 1 338 46
there 1 338 46
is 1 338 46
absolutely 1 338 46
no 1 338 46
evidence 1 338 46
in 1 338 46
the 1 338 46
book 1 338 46
to 1 338 46
support 1 338 46
its 1 338 46
claims. 1 338 46

When 1 338 47
asked 1 338 47
for 1 338 47
any 1 338 47
proof 1 338 47
for 1 338 47
his 1 338 47
assertion 1 338 47
Harding 1 338 47
defensively 1 338 47
says 1 338 47
that 1 338 47
he 1 338 47
is 1 338 47
just 1 338 47
"storytelling" 1 338 47
- 1 338 47
in 1 338 47
other 1 338 47
words: 1 338 47
it 1 338 47
is 1 338 47
fiction. 1 338 47

Harding 1 338 48
earlier 1 338 48
wrote 1 338 48
a 1 338 48
book 1 338 48
about 1 338 48
Edward 1 338 48
Snowden 1 338 48
which 1 338 48
was 1 338 48
a 1 338 48
similar 1 338 48
sham. 1 338 48

Julian 1 338 49
Assange 1 338 49
called 1 338 49
it 1 338 49
"a 1 338 49
hack 1 338 49
job 1 338 49
in 1 338 49
the 1 338 49
purest 1 338 49
sense 1 338 49
of 1 338 49
the 1 338 49
term". 1 338 49

Harding 1 338 50
is 1 338 50
also 1 338 50
known 1 338 50
as 1 338 50
plagiarizer. 1 338 50

When 1 338 51
he 1 338 51
worked 1 338 51
in 1 338 51
Moscow 1 338 51
he 1 338 51
copied 1 338 51
stories 1 338 51
and 1 338 51
passages 1 338 51
from 1 338 51
the 1 338 51
now 1 338 51
defunct 1 338 51
Exile, 1 338 51
run 1 338 51
by 1 338 51
Matt 1 338 51
Taibbi 1 338 51
and 1 338 51
Mark 1 338 51
Ames. 1 338 51

The 1 338 52
Guardian 1 338 52
had 1 338 52
to 1 338 52
publish 1 338 52
an 1 338 52
apology. 1 338 52

The 1 338 53
new 1 338 53
Guardian 1 338 53
story 1 338 53
looked 1 338 53
like 1 338 53
another 1 338 53
weak 1 338 53
attempt 1 338 53
to 1 338 53
connect 1 338 53
the 1 338 53
alleged 1 338 53
Russian 1 338 53
malfeasance 1 338 53
with 1 338 53
Assange 1 338 53
and 1 338 53
the 1 338 53
Wikileaks 1 338 53
publishing 1 338 53
of 1 338 53
the 1 338 53
DNC 1 338 53
emails. 1 338 53

Assange 1 338 54
and 1 338 54
other 1 338 54
involved 1 338 54
people 1 338 54
deny 1 338 54
that 1 338 54
such 1 338 54
a 1 338 54
relation 1 338 54
existed. 1 338 54

There 1 338 55
is 1 338 55
no 1 338 55
public 1 338 55
evidence 1 338 55
that 1 338 55
support 1 338 55

proceeded 0 338 60
with 0 338 60
this 0 338 60

even 0 338 60
after 0 338 60
being 0 338 60
notified 0 338 60
by 0 338 60
my 0 338 60

Manafort 0 338 64
held 0 338 64
secret 0 338 64
talks 0 338 64
with 0 338 64
Assange 0 338 64
in 0 338 64
Ecuadorian 0 338 64
embassy, 0 338 64
sources 0 338 64
say 0 338 64
... 0 338 64

It 0 338 65
is 0 338 65
unclear 0 338 65
why 0 338 65
Manafort 0 338 65
would 0 338 65
have 0 338 65
wanted 0 338 65
to 0 338 65

Assange 0 338 65
and 0 338 65
what 0 338 65
was 0 338 65
discussed. 0 338 65

But 0 338 66
the 0 338 66
last 0 338 66
apparent 0 338 66
meeting 0 338 66
is 0 338 66
likely 0 338 66

come 0 338 66
under 0 338 66
scrutiny 0 338 66

could 0 338 66

Why 0 338 68

might 0 338 68
have 0 338 68
sought 0 338 68
out 0 338 68
Assange 0 338 68
in 0 338 68
2013 0 338 68

unclear. 0 338 68

Manafort, 0 338 70

denies 0 338 70

the 1 338 70
claim 1 338 70
is 1 338 70
“100% 1 338 70
false”. 1 338 70

His 0 338 71

evidently 1 338 80
completely 1 338 80

It 1 338 90
smeared 1 338 90
Assange 1 338 90
and 1 338 90
Snowden 1 338 90
as 1 338 90
Russian 1 338 90
collaborators. 1 338 90

It 1 338 91
uncritically 1 338 91
peddled 1 338 91
the 1 338 91
Russiagate 1 338 91
story 1 338 91
and 1 338 91
the 1 338 91
nonsensical 1 338 91
Skripal 1 338 91
claims 1 338 91
which 1 338 91
are 1 338 91
both 1 338 91
obviously 1 338 91
concocted 1 338 91
by 1 338 91
British 1 338 91

That 1 338 92
seems 1 338 92
to 1 338 92
have 1 338 92
become 1 338 92
its 1 338 92

the 1 338 94
Guardian’s 1 338 94
smear 1 338 94
on 1 338 94
its 1 338 94
face, 1 338 94
the 1 338 94
fact 1 338 94
that 1 338 94
the 1 338 94
Guardian 1 338 94
published 1 338 94
this 1 338 94
piece, 1 338 94
and 1 338 94
that 1 338 94
Luke 1 338 94
Harding 1 338 94
is 1 338 94
still 1 338 94
operating 1 338 94
with 1 338 94
even 1 338 94
the 1 338 94
tiniest 1 338 94
modicum 1 338 94
of 1 338 94
respect 1 338 94
as 1 338 94
a 1 338 94
journalist 1 338 94
despite 1 338 94
his 1 338 94
history 1 338 94
of 1 338 94
deceit, 1 338 94
tells 1 338 94
us 1 338 94
something 1 338 94
bone-chilling 1 338 94
about 1 338 94
journalism. 1 338 94

It 1 338 95
is 1 338 95
no 1 338 95
accident 1 338 95
that 1 338 95
Luke 1 338 95
Harding 1 338 95
is 1 338 95
still 1 338 95
employed: 1 338 95
in 1 338 95
fact, 1 338 95
it 1 338 95
is 1 338 95
because 1 338 95
of 1 338 95
Harding’s 1 338 95
consistent 1 338 95
loyalty 1 338 95
to 1 338 95
establishment, 1 338 95
specifically 1 338 95
the 1 338 95
UK 1 338 95
intelligence 1 338 95
apparatus, 1 338 95
over 1 338 95
the 1 338 95
truth 1 338 95
that 1 338 95
determines 1 338 95
his 1 338 95
“success” 1 338 95
amongst 1 338 95
legacy 1 338 95
press 1 338 95
outlets. 1 338 95

Harding 1 338 96
is 1 338 96
not 1 338 96
a 1 338 96
defacement 1 338 96
or 1 338 96
a 1 338 96
departure 1 338 96
from 1 338 96
the 1 338 96
norm, 1 338 96
but 1 338 96
the 1 338 96
personification 1 338 96
of 1 338 96
it. 1 338 96

Jonathan 0 338 97
Cook, 0 338 97
a 0 338 97
former 0 338 97
Guardian 0 338 97
writer, 0 338 97
makes 0 338 97
a 0 338 97
similar 0 338 97
point: 0 338 97

The 0 338 98
truth 0 338 98
is 0 338 98
that 0 338 98
the 0 338 98
Guardian 0 338 98
has 0 338 98
not 0 338 98
erred 0 338 98
in 0 338 98
this 0 338 98
latest 0 338 98
story 0 338 98
attacking 0 338 98
Assange, 0 338 98
or 0 338 98
in 0 338 98
its 0 338 98
much 0 338 98
longer-running 0 338 98
campaign 0 338 98
to 1 338 98
vilify 1 338 98
him. 1 338 98

With 1 338 99
this 1 338 99
story, 1 338 99
it 1 338 99
has 1 338 99
done 1 338 99
what 1 338 99
it 1 338 99
regularly 1 338 99
does 1 338 99
when 1 338 99
supposedly 1 338 99
vital 1 338 99
western 1 338 99
foreign 1 338 99
policy 1 338 99
interests 1 338 99
are 1 338 99
at 1 338 99
stake 1 338 99
– 1 338 99
it 1 338 99
simply 1 338 99
regurgitates 1 338 99
an 1 338 99
elite-serving, 1 338 99
western 1 338 99
narrative. 1 338 99

Its 1 338 100
job 1 338 100
is 1 338 100
to 1 338 100
shore 1 338 100
up 1 338 100
a 1 338 100
consensus 1 338 100
on 1 338 100
the 1 338 100
left 1 338 100
for 1 338 100
attacks 1 338 100
on 1 338 100
leading 1 338 100
threats 1 338 100
to 1 338 100
the 1 338 100
existing, 1 338 100
neoliberal 1 338 100
order: 1 338 100
... 1 338 100

The 1 338 101
Guardian 1 338 101
did 1 338 101
not 1 338 101
make 1 338 101
a 1 338 101
mistake 1 338 101
in 1 338 101
vilifying 1 338 101
Assange 1 338 101
without 1 338 101
a 1 338 101
shred 1 338 101
of 1 338 101
evidence. 1 338 101

It 1 338 102
did 1 338 102
what 1 338 102
it 1 338 102
is 1 338 102
designed 1 338 102
to 1 338 102
do. 1 338 102

We 1 338 103
have 1 338 103
previously 1 338 103
shown 1 338 103
that 1 338 103
the 1 338 103
Guardian 1 338 103
even 1 338 103
uses 1 338 103
fascist 1 338 103
propaganda 1 338 103
tropes 1 338 103
to 1 338 103
smear 1 338 103
the 1 338 103
Russian 1 338 103
people. 1 338 103

It 1 338 104
is 1 338 104
openly 1 338 104
publishing 1 338 104
Goebbels' 1 338 104
cartoons 1 338 104
and 1 338 104
rhetoric 1 338 104
against 1 338 104
Europes 1 338 104
biggest 1 338 104
state. 1 338 104

There 1 338 105
is 1 338 105
no 1 338 105
longer 1 338 105
any 1 338 105
line 1 338 105
that 1 338 105
it 1 338 105
does 1 338 105
not 1 338 105
dare 1 338 105
to 1 338 105
cross. 1 338 105

Unfortunately 1 338 106
other 1 338 106
'western' 1 338 106
media 1 338 106
are 1 338 106
not 1 338 106
much 1 338 106
better. 1 338 106

Within 0 338 107
hours 0 338 107
of 0 338 107
being 0 338 107
published 0 338 107
the 0 338 107
Guardian 0 338 107
piece 0 338 107
was 0 338 107
debunked 0 338 107
as 0 338 107
fake 0 338 107
news. 0 338 107

That 0 338 108
did 0 338 108
not 0 338 108
hinder 0 338 108
other 0 338 108
outlets 0 338 108
to 0 338 108
add 0 338 108
to 0 338 108
its 0 338 108
smear. 1 338 108

Politico 1 338 109
allowed 1 338 109
"a 1 338 109
former 1 338 109
CIA 1 338 109
officer," 1 338 109
writing 1 338 109
under 1 338 109
a 1 338 109
pen 1 338 109
name, 1 338 109
to 1 338 109
suggest 1 338 109
- 1 338 109
without 1 338 109
any 1 338 109
evidence 1 338 109
- 1 338 109
that 1 338 109
the 1 338 109
Guardian 1 338 109
has 1 338 109
been 1 338 109
duped 1 338 109
- 1 338 109
not 1 338 109
by 1 338 109
its 1 338 109
MI5/6 1 338 109
and 1 338 109
Ecuadorian 1 338 109

but 1 338 109
by 1 338 109
Russian 1 338 109
disinformation: 1 338 109

Rather 0 338 110
than 0 338 110
being 0 338 110
the 1 338 110
bombshell 1 338 110
smoking 1 338 110
gun 1 338 110
that 1 338 110
directly 1 338 110

the 1 338 110
Trump 1 338 110
campaign 1 338 110
to 1 338 110
WikiLeaks, 1 338 110
perhaps 0 338 110
the 0 338 110
report 0 338 110
is 0 338 110
something 0 338 110
else 0 338 110
entirely: 0 338 110
a 1 338 110
disinformation 1 338 110
campaign. 1 338 110

Is 1 338 111
it 1 338 111
possible 1 338 111
someone 1 338 111
planted 1 338 111
this 1 338 111
story 1 338 111
as 1 338 111
a 1 338 111
means 1 338 111
to 1 338 111
discredit 1 338 111
the 1 338 111
journalists? 1 338 111

... 0 338 112

Harding 0 338 113
is 0 338 113
likely 0 338 113
a 0 338 113
major 0 338 113

anyone 0 338 113

Manafort 0 338 115

false—that 0 338 115
is, 0 338 115

for 0 338 115
example, 0 338 115

the 0 338 115

the 0 338 115
most 0 338 115
logical 0 338 115
explanation 0 338 115
is 0 338 115
that 0 338 115

an 0 338 115
attempt 0 338 115

The 1 338 116

been 1 341 12
set-up 1 341 12
as 1 341 12
a 1 341 12
treasonous 1 341 12
enemy 1 341 12
of 1 341 12
America. 1 341 12

We 0 341 13
are 0 341 13
currently 0 341 13
experiencing 0 341 13
sedition 0 341 13
at 0 341 13

In 1 341 14
1961 1 341 14
President 1 341 14
Dwight 1 341 14
Eisenhower 1 341 14
warned 1 341 14
Americans 1 341 14
in 1 341 14
his 1 341 14
last 1 341 14
public 1 341 14
address 1 341 14
that 1 341 14
the 1 341 14
military/industrial 1 341 14
complex 1 341 14
was 1 341 14
a 1 341 14
threat 1 341 14
to 1 341 14
American 1 341 14
democracy. 1 341 14

Truer 0 341 15

never 0 341 15
spoken 0 341 15
by 0 341 15
an 0 341 15

Shortly 0 341 16
thereafter, 0 341 16
the 0 341 16

assassinated 0 341 16

To 0 341 17
get 0 341 17
rid 0 341 17

which 0 341 19

the 0 341 19

only 1 341 28
the 1 341 28
“deplorables,” 1 341 28
and 1 341 28
they 1 341 28
are 1 341 28
unorganized 1 341 28

experience 1 341 28
retribution 1 341 28
once 1 341 28

On 0 342 16
Thursday, 0 342 16
investigators 0 342 16
revealed 0 342 16
that 0 342 16
the 0 342 16

a 0 342 16

but 0 342 16
neglected 0 342 16
to 0 342 16
provide 0 342 16
further 0 342 16
details 0 342 16
about 0 342 16
the 0 342 16
purpose 0 342 16
of 0 342 16
the 0 342 16
note. 0 342 16

In 0 342 17
their 0 342 17
first 0 342 17

which 0 342 17

air 0 342 17
on 0 342 17
CBS 0 342 17
Sunday 0 342 17

to 0 342 17
60 0 342 17
Minutes 0 342 17
that 0 342 17
finally 0 342 17
explain 0 342 17
what 0 342 17
was 0 342 17
written 0 342 17
on 0 342 17
the 0 342 17
mysterious 0 342 17
note. 0 342 17

“I 0 342 18
could 0 342 18
see 0 342 18
on 0 342 18
it 0 342 18
he 0 342 18
had 0 342 18
written 0 342 18
the 0 342 18
distance, 0 342 18
the 0 342 18
elevation 0 342 18
he 0 342 18
was 0 342 18
on, 0 342 18
the 0 342 18
drop 0 342 18
of 0 342 18
what 0 342 18
his 0 342 18
bullet 0 342 18
was 0 342 18
gonna 0 342 18
be 0 342 18
for 0 342 18
the 0 342 18
crowd,” 0 342 18
said 0 342 18
Officer 0 342 18
Dave 0 342 18
Newton 0 342 18
from 0 342 18
the 0 342 18
Las 0 342 18

Police 0 342 18
in 0 342 18
a 0 342 18
preview 0 342 18
clip 0 342 18
of 0 342 18
Sunday’s 0 342 18
report. 0 342 18

“So 0 342 19
he 0 342 19
had 0 342 19
that 0 342 19
written 0 342 19
down 0 342 19
and 0 342 19
figured 0 342 19
out 0 342 19
so 0 342 19
he 0 342 19
would 0 342 19
know 0 342 19
where 0 342 19
to 0 342 19
shoot 0 342 19
to 0 342 19
hit 0 342 19
his 0 342 19
targets 0 342 19
from 0 342 19
there.” 0 342 19

Paddock’s 0 342 20
note 0 342 20
was 0 342 20
clearly 0 342 20
not 0 342 20
a 0 342 20
suicide 0 342 20
letter. 0 342 20

Rather, 0 342 21
it 0 342 21
detailed 0 342 21
bullet 0 342 21
trajectory 0 342 21
and 0 342 21
included 0 342 21
calculations 0 342 21
about 0 342 21
where 0 342 21
he 0 342 21
needed 0 342 21
to 0 342 21
aim 0 342 21
his 0 342 21
weapons 0 342 21
to 0 342 21
maximize 0 342 21
accuracy 0 342 21
and 0 342 21
optimize 0 342 21
his 0 342 21
kill 0 342 21
rate. 0 342 21

Investigators 0 342 22
have 0 342 22
also 0 342 22
been 0 342 22
looking 0 342 22
for 0 342 22
a 0 342 22
‘mystery 0 342 22
woman’ 0 342 22
who 0 342 22
was 0 342 22
seen 0 342 22
with 0 342 22
Stephen 0 342 22
Paddock 0 342 22
in 0 342 22
the 0 342 22
days 0 342 22
leading 0 342 22
up 0 342 22
to 0 342 22
the 0 342 22
Las 0 342 22

shooting. 0 342 22

According 0 342 23
to 0 342 23
ABC 0 342 23
News, 0 342 23
the 0 342 23
‘mystery 0 342 23
woman’ 0 342 23
everyone 0 342 23
on 0 342 23
the 0 342 23
internet 0 342 23
was 0 342 23
talking 0 342 23
about 0 342 23
has 0 342 23
been 0 342 23
identified. 0 342 23

While 1 342 24
officials 1 342 24
did 1 342 24
not 1 342 24
reveal 1 342 24
the 1 342 24
woman’s 1 342 24
name, 1 342 24
they 1 342 24
did 1 342 24
tell 1 342 24
reporters 1 342 24
she 1 342 24
was 1 342 24
a 1 342 24
prostitute. 1 342 24

Police 0 342 25
are 0 342 25
still 0 342 25
investigating 0 342 25
whether 0 342 25
or 0 342 25
not 0 342 25
Paddock 0 342 25
acted 0 342 25
alone. 0 342 25

They 0 342 26
believe 0 342 26
he 0 342 26
may 0 342 26
have 0 342 26
had 0 342 26
an 0 342 26
accomplice 0 342 26
based 0 342 26
on 0 342 26
the 0 342 26
elaborate 0 342 26
planning 0 342 26
needed 0 342 26
to 0 342 26
undertake 0 342 26
such 0 342 26
a 0 342 26
massacre 0 342 26
and 0 342 26
the 0 342 26
fact 0 342 26
that 0 342 26
some 0 342 26
ammunition 1 342 26
was 1 342 26
purchased 1 342 26
under 1 342 26
someone 1 342 26
else’s 1 342 26
name. 1 342 26

As 0 342 27
ABC 0 342 27
reported 0 342 27
Friday 0 342 27
evening: 0 342 27

“Meantime, 0 342 28

out 0 342 28
whether 0 342 28
Paddock 0 342 28
acted 0 342 28
alone. 0 342 28

Authorities 0 342 29
believe 0 342 29
he 0 342 29
may 0 342 29
have 0 342 29
had 0 342 29
an 0 342 29

on 0 342 29

night’s 0 342 29
rampage. 0 342 29

Officials 0 342 30
also 0 342 30
believe 0 342 30
he 0 342 30
had 0 342 30
help 0 342 30
because 0 342 30
of 0 342 30
the 0 342 30
amount 0 342 30
of 0 342 30
guns 0 342 30
in 0 342 30
his 0 342 30
hotel 0 342 30
room, 0 342 30

because 0 342 30
some 0 342 30
of 0 342 30
the 0 342 30

Every 0 343 2
time 0 343 2
Mass 0 343 2
is 0 343 2
celebrated, 0 343 2
the 0 343 2

prays 0 343 2
that 0 343 2

“look 0 343 2
not 0 343 2
on 0 343 2

on 0 343 2
the 0 343 2
faith 0 343 2
of 0 343 2
[his] 0 343 2
Church… 0 343 2
.” 0 343 2
That’s 0 343 2
been 0 343 2
an 0 343 2
important 0 343 2
prayer 0 343 2
for 0 343 2
me 0 343 2
in 0 343 2
the 0 343 2
time 0 343 2
that 0 343 2
I 0 343 2
have 0 343 2
been 0 343 2
serving 0 343 2
this 0 343 2
archdiocese, 0 343 2
well 0 343 2
aware 0 343 2
of 0 343 2
our 0 343 2
sins 0 343 2
but 0 343 2
equally 0 343 2
aware 0 343 2
of 0 343 2
the 1 343 2
strong 1 343 2
and 1 343 2
vibrant 1 343 2
faith 1 343 2
of 0 343 2
this 0 343 2
local 0 343 2
Church. 0 343 2

I’ve 0 343 3
been 0 343 3
praying 0 343 3
that 0 343 3
prayer 0 343 3
even 0 343 3
more 0 343 3
earnestly 0 343 3
in 0 343 3
these 0 343 3
past 0 343 3
weeks 0 343 3
as 0 343 3
the 0 343 3
Church 0 343 3
in 0 343 3
the 0 343 3
United 0 343 3

has 0 343 3
once 0 343 3
again 0 343 3
come 0 343 3
face-to-face 0 343 3
with 0 343 3
its 0 343 3
sins, 0 343 3
with 0 343 3
reports 0 343 3
that 0 343 3
former 0 343 3
cardinal 0 343 3
Theodore 0 343 3
McCarrick, 0 343 3
one 1 343 3
of 1 343 3
the 1 343 3
most 1 343 3
prominent 1 343 3
Churchmen 1 343 3
in 1 343 3
the 1 343 3
United 1 343 3
States 1 343 3
in 1 343 3
the 1 343 3
last 1 343 3
quarter 1 343 3
century, 1 343 3
has 0 343 3
been 0 343 3
accused 0 343 3
of 0 343 3
abusing 0 343 3
two 0 343 3
minors 0 343 3
and 0 343 3
sexually 0 343 3
harassing 0 343 3
or 0 343 3
assaulting 0 343 3
a 0 343 3
number 0 343 3
of 0 343 3
seminarians 0 343 3
and 0 343 3
young 0 343 3
priests. 0 343 3

To 1 343 4
make 1 343 4
matters 1 343 4
worse 1 343 4
(if 1 343 4
that 1 343 4
is 1 343 4
even 1 343 4
possible), 1 343 4
evidence 0 343 4
has 0 343 4
surfaced 0 343 4
that 0 343 4
indicates 0 343 4
that 0 343 4
a 0 343 4
bishop, 0 343 4
as 0 343 4
well 0 343 4
as 0 343 4
some 0 343 4
priests 0 343 4
and 0 343 4
laity, 0 343 4
had 0 343 4
brought 0 343 4
the 0 343 4
allegations 0 343 4
about 0 343 4
misconduct 0 343 4
with 0 343 4
seminarians 0 343 4
to 0 343 4
the 0 343 4
attention 0 343 4
of 0 343 4
Church 0 343 4
authorities 0 343 4
but 0 343 4
to 0 343 4
no 0 343 4
avail: 0 343 4
Archbishop 0 343 4
McCarrick 0 343 4
was 0 343 4
nonetheless 0 343 4
“promoted” 0 343 4
to 0 343 4
become 0 343 4
the 0 343 4
archbishop 0 343 4
in 0 343 4
our 1 343 4
nation’s 1 343 4
capital, 0 343 4
and 0 343 4
elevated 0 343 4
to 0 343 4
the 0 343 4
College 0 343 4
of 0 343 4
Cardinals. 0 343 4

While 0 343 5
I 0 343 5
realize 0 343 5
that 0 343 5
it 0 343 5
is 0 343 5
not 0 343 5
always 0 343 5
easy 0 343 5
to 0 343 5
evaluate 0 343 5
the 0 343 5
credibility 0 343 5
of 0 343 5
those 0 343 5
bringing 0 343 5
allegations, 0 343 5
and 0 343 5
that 0 343 5
there’s 0 343 5
often 0 343 5
a 0 343 5
tendency 0 343 5
to 0 343 5
believe 0 343 5
those 0 343 5
we 0 343 5
know 0 343 5
over 0 343 5
those 0 343 5
we 0 343 5
don’t, 0 343 5
I 1 343 5
don’t 1 343 5
think 1 343 5
that 1 343 5
the 1 343 5
Church 1 343 5
in 1 343 5
the 1 343 5
United 1 343 5

will 1 343 5
rest 1 343 5
— 1 343 5
and 1 343 5
confidence 1 343 5
will 1 343 5
be 1 343 5
restored 1 343 5
— 1 343 5
until 1 343 5
the 1 343 5
matter 1 343 5
is 1 343 5
independently 1 343 5
investigated 1 343 5
and 1 343 5
explained, 1 343 5
and 1 343 5
assurances 1 343 5
are 1 343 5
given 1 343 5
that 1 343 5
there 1 343 5
are 1 343 5
safeguards 1 343 5
in 1 343 5
place 1 343 5
to 1 343 5
make 1 343 5

that 1 343 5
something 1 343 5
like 1 343 5
this 1 343 5
couldn’t 1 343 5
happen 1 343 5
again. 1 343 5

The 0 343 6
matter 0 343 6
has 0 343 6
been 0 343 6
particularly 0 343 6
troubling 0 343 6
to 0 343 6
me 0 343 6
personally 0 343 6
due 0 343 6
to 0 343 6
the 0 343 6
fact 0 343 6
that 0 343 6
I 0 343 6
had 0 343 6
served 0 343 6
in 0 343 6
the 0 343 6
Archdiocese 0 343 6
of 0 343 6
Newark 0 343 6
as 0 343 6
coadjutor 0 343 6
archbishop 0 343 6
from 0 343 6
November 0 343 6
4, 0 343 6
2013, 0 343 6
to 0 343 6
March 0 343 6
25, 0 343 6
2016, 0 343 6
when 0 343 6
I 0 343 6
was 0 343 6
named 0 343 6
archbishop 0 343 6
here. 0 343 6

It 0 343 7
was 0 343 7
while 0 343 7
I 0 343 7
was 0 343 7
in 0 343 7
Newark 0 343 7
that 0 343 7
I 0 343 7
was 0 343 7
introduced 0 343 7
to 0 343 7
then-Cardinal 0 343 7
McCarrick. 0 343 7

A 0 343 8
number 0 343 8
of 0 343 8
good 1 343 8
Catholics 1 343 8
have 0 343 8
written 0 343 8
to 0 343 8
ask 0 343 8
for 0 343 8
a 0 343 8
personal 0 343 8
accounting 0 343 8
on 0 343 8
my 0 343 8
part, 0 343 8
inquiring 0 343 8
whether 0 343 8
I 0 343 8
was 0 343 8
made 0 343 8
aware 0 343 8
in 0 343 8
my 0 343 8
time 0 343 8
in 0 343 8
Newark 0 343 8
of 0 343 8
the 0 343 8
2005 0 343 8
and 0 343 8
2007 0 343 8
settlements 0 343 8
involving 0 343 8
Archbishop 0 343 8
McCarrick, 0 343 8
or 0 343 8
if 0 343 8
I 0 343 8
knew 0 343 8
of 0 343 8
any 0 343 8
allegations 0 343 8
against 0 343 8
him. 0 343 8

I 0 343 9
can 0 343 9
state 0 343 9
unequivocally 0 343 9
that 0 343 9
I 0 343 9
learned 0 343 9
of 0 343 9
those 0 343 9
settlements 0 343 9
only 0 343 9
in 0 343 9
June 0 343 9
of 0 343 9
this 0 343 9
year, 0 343 9
as 0 343 9
news 0 343 9
broke 0 343 9
about 0 343 9
the 0 343 9
unrelated 0 343 9
claim 0 343 9
that 0 343 9
had 0 343 9
been 0 343 9
filed 0 343 9
in 0 343 9
the 0 343 9
Archdiocese 0 343 9
of 0 343 9
New 0 343 9
York. 0 343 9

What 0 343 10
I 0 343 10
know 0 343 10
of 0 343 10
the 0 343 10
settlements 0 343 10
I 0 343 10
know 0 343 10
from 0 343 10
the 0 343 10
newspapers. 0 343 10

When 0 343 11
serving 0 343 11
in 0 343 11
Newark, 0 343 11
I 0 343 11
was 0 343 11
regularly 0 343 11
briefed 0 343 11
on 0 343 11
current 0 343 11
legal 0 343 11
matters 0 343 11
of 0 343 11
all 0 343 11
sorts, 0 343 11
but 0 343 11
not 0 343 11
on 0 343 11
past 0 343 11
legal 0 343 11
matters 0 343 11
(unless 0 343 11
they 0 343 11
were 0 343 11
still 0 343 11
being 0 343 11
discussed 0 343 11
in 0 343 11
the 0 343 11
press). 0 343 11

By 0 343 12
the 0 343 12
time 0 343 12
I 0 343 12
arrived 0 343 12
in 0 343 12
Newark 0 343 12
in 0 343 12
November 0 343 12
2013, 0 343 12
the 1 343 12
2005 1 343 12
and 1 343 12
2007 1 343 12
settlements 1 343 12
were 1 343 12
apparently 1 343 12
considered 1 343 12
ancient 1 343 12
history. 1 343 12

It 0 343 13
would 0 343 13
be 0 343 13
untrue 0 343 13
to 0 343 13
state 0 343 13
that 0 343 13
I 0 343 13
had 0 343 13
never 0 343 13
heard 0 343 13
any 0 343 13
allegations 0 343 13
about 0 343 13
Cardinal 0 343 13
McCarrick. 0 343 13

Years 0 343 14
before 0 343 14
I 0 343 14
ever 0 343 14
lived 0 343 14
in 0 343 14
Newark, 0 343 14
and 0 343 14
never 0 343 14
imagining 0 343 14
that 0 343 14
I 0 343 14
would 0 343 14
be 0 343 14
assigned 0 343 14
there, 0 343 14
I 0 343 14
had 0 343 14
indeed 0 343 14
read 0 343 14
— 0 343 14
as 0 343 14
a 1 343 14
somewhat 1 343 14
geeky 1 343 14
ex-lawyer 1 343 14
— 0 343 14
an 0 343 14
allegation 0 343 14
about 0 343 14
Cardinal 0 343 14
McCarrick 0 343 14
in 0 343 14
the 0 343 14
context 0 343 14
of 0 343 14
a 0 343 14
2005 0 343 14
lawsuit 0 343 14
in 0 343 14
the 0 343 14
Southern 0 343 14
District 0 343 14
of 0 343 14
New 0 343 14
York 0 343 14
against 0 343 14
Archbishop 0 343 14
Myers, 0 343 14
Cardinal 0 343 14
Eagan, 0 343 14
Bishop 0 343 14
Hubbard 0 343 14
and 0 343 14
the 0 343 14
Irish 0 343 14
Christian 0 343 14
Brothers. 0 343 14

While 0 343 15
the 0 343 15
complaint 0 343 15
didn’t 0 343 15
supply 0 343 15
any 0 343 15
details, 0 343 15
the 0 343 15
plaintiff 0 343 15
was 0 343 15
reported 0 343 15
to 0 343 15
have 0 343 15
said 0 343 15
to 0 343 15
a 0 343 15
journalist 0 343 15
that 0 343 15
“Archbishop 0 343 15
McCarrick 0 343 15
would 0 343 15
share 0 343 15
a 0 343 15
bed 0 343 15
with 0 343 15
seminarians 0 343 15
but 0 343 15
not 0 343 15
engage 0 343 15
in 0 343 15
any 0 343 15
activity 0 343 15
with 0 343 15
them.” 0 343 15
The 0 343 15
complaint 0 343 15
would 0 343 15
later 0 343 15
be 0 343 15
formally 0 343 15
amended 0 343 15
to 0 343 15
include 0 343 15
that 0 343 15
allegation. 0 343 15

Knowing, 0 343 16
however, 0 343 16
that 0 343 16
this 0 343 16
lawsuit 0 343 16
was 0 343 16
completely 0 343 16
dismissed 0 343 16
by 0 343 16
the 0 343 16
state 0 343 16
and 0 343 16
federal 0 343 16
courts, 0 343 16
I 0 343 16
never 0 343 16
gave 0 343 16
the 0 343 16
particular 0 343 16
allegation 0 343 16
about 0 343 16
Cardinal 0 343 16
McCarrick 0 343 16
any 0 343 16
credence. 0 343 16

I 0 343 17
can 0 343 17
also 0 343 17
state 0 343 17
without 0 343 17
exception 0 343 17
that 0 343 17
no 0 343 17
one 0 343 17
in 0 343 17
my 0 343 17
years 0 343 17
in 0 343 17
Newark 0 343 17
ever 0 343 17
told 0 343 17
me 0 343 17
that 0 343 17
they 0 343 17
were 0 343 17
improperly 0 343 17
touched 0 343 17
by 0 343 17
Archbishop 0 343 17
McCarrick, 0 343 17
and 0 343 17
no 0 343 17
one 0 343 17
ever 0 343 17
told 0 343 17
me 0 343 17
that 0 343 17
they 0 343 17
had 0 343 17
to 0 343 17
share 0 343 17
a 0 343 17
bed 0 343 17
with 0 343 17
him 0 343 17
or 0 343 17
that 0 343 17
they 0 343 17
had 0 343 17
seen 0 343 17
anyone 0 343 17
share 0 343 17
a 0 343 17
bed 0 343 17
with 0 343 17
him. 0 343 17

I 0 343 18
heard 0 343 18
lots 0 343 18
of 0 343 18
gut-wrenching 1 343 18
stories 1 343 18
in 0 343 18
my 0 343 18
two-and-a-half 0 343 18
years 0 343 18
there, 0 343 18
but 0 343 18
none 0 343 18
of 0 343 18
them 0 343 18
involved 0 343 18
Archbishop 0 343 18
McCarrick. 0 343 18

With 0 343 19
St. 0 343 19
John 0 343 19
Paul 0 343 19
II’s 0 343 19
1995 0 343 19
visit, 0 343 19
he 0 343 19
was 0 343 19
remembered 0 343 19
for 0 343 19
“bringing 1 343 19
a 1 343 19
saint 1 343 19
to 1 343 19
Newark,” 1 343 19
not 0 343 19
as 0 343 19
an 1 343 19
abuser 1 343 19
of 1 343 19
seminarians, 1 343 19
minors 1 343 19
or 1 343 19
priests. 1 343 19

When 0 343 20
I 0 343 20
was 0 343 20
installed 0 343 20
here 0 343 20
in 0 343 20
St. 0 343 20
Paul, 0 343 20
he 0 343 20
joined 0 343 20
me 0 343 20
at 0 343 20
lunch 0 343 20
along 0 343 20
with 0 343 20
my 0 343 20
father, 0 343 20
sister, 0 343 20
godmother 0 343 20
and 0 343 20
then 0 343 20
12-year-old 0 343 20
nephew. 0 343 20

I 0 343 21
can 0 343 21
assure 0 343 21
you 0 343 21
that 0 343 21
I 0 343 21
would 0 343 21
never 0 343 21
have 0 343 21
allowed 0 343 21
that 0 343 21
to 0 343 21
happen 0 343 21
if 0 343 21
I 0 343 21
had 0 343 21
any 0 343 21
reason 0 343 21
to 0 343 21
know 0 343 21
or 0 343 21
even 0 343 21
suspect 0 343 21
the 0 343 21
things 0 343 21
that 0 343 21
have 0 343 21
been 0 343 21
reported 0 343 21
in 0 343 21
the 0 343 21
newspapers 0 343 21
this 0 343 21
past 0 343 21
month. 0 343 21

While 0 343 22
the 0 343 22
letters 0 343 22
and 0 343 22
emails 0 343 22
of 0 343 22
recent 0 343 22
days 0 343 22
are 0 343 22
sober 1 343 22
reminders 1 343 22
that 0 343 22
there’s 0 343 22
still 0 343 22
a 0 343 22
long 0 343 22
way 0 343 22
to 0 343 22
go 0 343 22
in 0 343 22
restoring 0 343 22
trust, 0 343 22
I 0 343 22
nonetheless 0 343 22
welcome 0 343 22
the 0 343 22
efforts 0 343 22
to 0 343 22
hold 0 343 22
me 0 343 22
accountable 0 343 22
to 0 343 22
you, 0 343 22
the 0 343 22
faithful 0 343 22
of 0 343 22
this 0 343 22
archdiocese. 0 343 22

The 0 343 23
events 0 343 23
of 0 343 23
these 0 343 23
past 0 343 23
weeks 0 343 23
have 0 343 23
shown 0 343 23
that 0 343 23
no 1 343 23
one 1 343 23
can 1 343 23
be 1 343 23
above 1 343 23
the 1 343 23
law, 1 343 23
regardless 1 343 23
of 1 343 23
rank 1 343 23
or 1 343 23
privilege. 1 343 23

I 0 343 24
was 0 343 24
grateful 0 343 24
for 0 343 24
the 0 343 24
opportunity 0 343 24
to 0 343 24
reinforce 0 343 24
that 0 343 24
with 0 343 24
our 0 343 24
seminarians 0 343 24
this 0 343 24
past 0 343 24
weekend, 0 343 24
and 0 343 24
I 0 343 24
look 0 343 24
forward 0 343 24
to 0 343 24
continuing 0 343 24
my 0 343 24
work 0 343 24
with 0 343 24
the 0 343 24
Office 0 343 24
of 0 343 24
Ministerial 0 343 24
Standards 0 343 24
and 0 343 24
Safe 0 343 24
Environment, 0 343 24
and 0 343 24
our 0 343 24
Archdiocesan 0 343 24
Review 0 343 24
Board, 0 343 24
in 0 343 24
creating 0 343 24
a 0 343 24
culture 0 343 24
in 0 343 24
which 0 343 24
no 0 343 24
one 0 343 24
need 0 343 24
be 0 343 24
afraid 0 343 24
or 0 343 24
reluctant 0 343 24
to 0 343 24
bring 0 343 24
forth 0 343 24
an 0 343 24
allegation 0 343 24
of 0 343 24
misconduct. 0 343 24

Our 0 343 25
heavenly 1 343 25
patron, 1 343 25
St. 0 343 25
Paul, 0 343 25
reminds 0 343 25
us 0 343 25
that 0 343 25
“where 0 343 25
sin 0 343 25
abounds, 0 343 25
grace 0 343 25
abounds 0 343 25
all 0 343 25
the 0 343 25
more.” 0 343 25
May 0 343 25
these 0 343 25
difficult 0 343 25
days 0 343 25
be 0 343 25
days 0 343 25
of 0 343 25
great 0 343 25
grace 0 343 25
for 0 343 25
this 0 343 25
local 0 343 25
Church. 0 343 25

REMNANT 0 343 26
COMMENT: 0 343 26
While 0 343 26
we 0 343 26
certainly 0 343 26
appreciate 0 343 26
His 0 343 26
Excellency's 0 343 26
candid 1 343 26
explanation 1 343 26
of 0 343 26
what 0 343 26
he 0 343 26
knew 0 343 26
and 0 343 26
did 0 343 26
not 0 343 26
know 0 343 26
about 0 343 26
this 0 343 26
horrific 1 343 26
scandal 1 343 26
in 0 343 26
the 0 343 26
Church, 0 343 26
we 1 343 26
would 1 343 26
also 1 343 26
humbly 1 343 26
beg 1 343 26
him 1 343 26
to 1 343 26
take 1 343 26
it 1 343 26
one 1 343 26
step 1 343 26

Persons”: 0 343 37

Although 0 343 38
the 0 343 38
particular 0 343 38
inclination 0 343 38
of 0 343 38
the 0 343 38
homosexual 0 343 38
person 0 343 38
is 0 343 38
not 0 343 38
a 0 343 38

it 0 343 38
is 0 343 38
a 0 343 38
more 0 343 38
or 0 343 38
less 0 343 38
strong 0 343 38

ordered 0 343 38
toward 0 343 38
an 0 343 38
intrinsic 0 343 38
moral 0 343 38
evil; 0 343 38
thus 1 343 38
the 1 343 38
inclination 1 343 38
itself 1 343 38
must 1 343 38
be 1 343 38
seen 1 343 38
as 1 343 38
an 1 343 38
objective 1 343 38
disorder. 1 343 38

Therefore 1 343 39
special 1 343 39
concern 1 343 39
and 1 343 39
pastoral 1 343 39
attention 1 343 39

directed 1 343 39
to 1 343 39
those 1 343 39
who 1 343 39
have 1 343 39
this 1 343 39
condition, 1 343 39
lest 1 343 39
they 1 343 39
be 1 343 39
led 1 343 39

that 1 343 39

living 1 343 39

this 1 343 39
orientation 1 343 39
in 1 343 39
homosexual 1 343 39
activity 1 343 39
is 1 343 39
a 1 343 39
morally 1 343 39
acceptable 1 343 39
option. 1 343 39

It 1 343 40
is 1 343 40
not. 1 343 40

Notice 0 343 41
the 0 343 41
late 0 343 41
pope 0 343 41
does 0 343 41
not 0 343 41
say, 0 343 41
“Let 0 343 41
the 0 343 41
practicing 0 343 41

on 0 343 41
a 0 343 41
regular 0 343 41
basis 0 343 41
in 0 343 41
the 0 343 41
media. 0 343 41

Does 0 343 42
Archbishop 0 343 42
Hebda 0 343 42
believe 0 343 42
it 0 343 42
is 0 343 42
time 0 343 42
for 0 343 42
the 0 343 42
Church 0 343 42
to 0 343 42
stop 1 343 42
humiliating 1 343 42
herself 1 343 42
by 1 343 42
stooping 1 343 42
to 1 343 42
accommodate 1 343 42
a 1 343 42
special 1 343 42
interest 1 343 42
group 1 343 42
that 1 343 42
obviously 1 343 42
doesn't 1 343 42
care 1 343 42
about 1 343 42
her 1 343 42
or 1 343 42
the 1 343 42
moral 1 343 42
code 1 343 42
by 1 343 42
which 1 343 42
she 1 343 42
governs? 1 343 42

Does 0 343 43
he 0 343 43
believe 0 343 43
that 0 343 43
all 0 343 43
Catholics 0 343 43
must 0 343 43
follow 0 343 43
the 0 343 43
rules 0 343 43
of 0 343 43
the 0 343 43
Church 0 343 43
pertaining 0 343 43
to 0 343 43
the 0 343 43
Sixth 0 343 43
Commandment...or 0 343 43
just 0 343 43
the 1 343 43
straight 1 343 43
Catholics? 1 343 43

Does 0 343 44
His 0 343 44
Excellency 0 343 44
believe 0 343 44
that 0 343 44
if 0 343 44
some 0 343 44
homosexual 0 343 44
Catholics 0 343 44
feel 0 343 44
they 0 343 44
need 0 343 44
not 0 343 44
bother 0 343 44
following 0 343 44
the 0 343 44
rules 0 343 44
they 0 343 44
should 0 343 44
be 0 343 44
warmly 0 343 44
welcomed 0 343 44
into 0 343 44
our 0 343 44
"Catholic 0 343 44
Christian" 0 343 44
community 0 343 44
anyway, 0 343 44
even 0 343 44
if 0 343 44
they 0 343 44
are 0 343 44
in 0 343 44
same-sex 0 343 44
unions? 0 343 44

Pope 0 343 45
John 0 343 45
Paul 0 343 45
certainly 0 343 45
didn't 0 343 45
accept 0 343 45
that. 0 343 45

In 0 343 46

Memory 0 343 46
and 0 343 46
Identity, 0 343 46
John 0 343 46
Paul 0 343 46
referred 0 343 46
to 0 343 46
homosexuality 0 343 46
as 0 343 46
an 1 343 46
“ideology 1 343 46
of 1 343 46
evil,” 1 343 46
insisting 0 343 46
of 0 343 46
so-called 0 343 46
'gay 0 343 46
marriage' 0 343 46
that: 0 343 46

“It 0 343 47
is 0 343 47
legitimate 0 343 47
and 0 343 47
necessary 0 343 47
to 0 343 47
ask 0 343 47
oneself 0 343 47
if 0 343 47
this 0 343 47
is 0 343 47
not 0 343 47
perhaps 0 343 47
part 0 343 47
of 0 343 47
a 1 343 47
new 1 343 47
ideology 1 343 47
of 1 343 47
evil, 1 343 47
perhaps 0 343 47
more 1 343 47
insidious 1 343 47
and 0 343 47
hidden, 0 343 47
which 0 343 47
attempts 0 343 47
to 1 343 47
pit 1 343 47
human 1 343 47
rights 1 343 47
against 1 343 47
the 1 343 47
family 1 343 47
and 1 343 47
man.” 1 343 47

Pope 1 343 48
John 1 343 48
Paul 1 343 48
THE 1 343 48
GREAT 1 343 48
an 1 343 48
intolerant 1 343 48
homophobe? 1 343 48

Are 1 343 49
Father 1 343 49
Martin 1 343 49
and 1 343 49
his 1 343 49
pals 1 343 49
in 1 343 49
the 1 343 49
episcopacy 1 343 49
really 1 343 49
so 1 343 49
enlightened 1 343 49
over 1 343 49
every 1 343 49
pope, 1 343 49
saint, 1 343 49
and 1 343 49
moral 1 343 49
theologian 1 343 49
in 1 343 49
history? 1 343 49

Or 1 343 50
is 1 343 50
it 1 343 50
not 1 343 50
so 1 343 50
that 1 343 50
it 1 343 50
is 1 343 50
both 1 343 50
negligent 1 343 50
and 1 343 50
uncharitable 1 343 50
for 1 343 50
some 1 343 50
bishops 1 343 50
to 1 343 50
refuse 1 343 50
to 1 343 50
inform 1 343 50
their 1 343 50
faithful 1 343 50
that 1 343 50
according 1 343 50
to 1 343 50
the 1 343 50
Church's 1 343 50
own 1 343 50
infallible 1 343 50
teaching, 1 343 50
everlasting 1 343 50
damnation 1 343 50
is 1 343 50
the 1 343 50
price 1 343 50
to 1 343 50
be 1 343 50
paid 1 343 50
for 1 343 50
this 1 343 50
kind 1 343 50
of 1 343 50
inclusivity 1 343 50
and 1 343 50
toleration? 1 343 50

And 0 343 51
if 0 343 51
the 0 343 51
episcopal 0 343 51
retort 0 343 51
is 0 343 51
going 0 343 51
to 0 343 51
be 0 343 51
that 0 343 51
this 0 343 51
acceptance 0 343 51
refers 0 343 51
only 0 343 51
to 0 343 51
chaste 0 343 51
homosexuals, 0 343 51
then 0 343 51
we 1 343 51
call 1 343 51
FOUL 1 343 51
even 1 343 51
louder 1 343 51
since 0 343 51
this 0 343 51
crosses 0 343 51
the 0 343 51
line 0 343 51
into 0 343 51
willful 1 343 51
deception. 1 343 51

We're 1 343 52
all 1 343 52
sinners, 1 343 52
of 1 343 52
course--- 1 343 52
and 0 343 52
the 0 343 52

repentant 0 343 52
homosexuals 0 343 52
as 0 343 52
they 0 343 52
are, 0 343 52
just 0 343 52
as 0 343 52
she 0 343 52
accepts 0 343 52
repentant 0 343 52
practitioners 0 343 52
of 0 343 52
ANY 1 343 52
sins 1 343 52
of 1 343 52
the 1 343 52
flesh. 1 343 52

So 1 343 53
why 1 343 53
are 1 343 53
our 1 343 53
bishops 1 343 53
playing 1 343 53
dumb? 1 343 53

Quite 1 343 54
obviously, 1 343 54
it 1 343 54
is 1 343 54
because 1 343 54
what 1 343 54
they 1 343 54
are 1 343 54
actually 1 343 54
closing 1 343 54
an 1 343 54
episcopal 1 343 54
eye 1 343 54
to 1 343 54
are 1 343 54
the 1 343 54
folks 1 343 54
who 1 343 54
want 1 343 54
to 1 343 54
keep 1 343 54
right 1 343 54
on 1 343 54
sinning--and 1 343 54
sinning 1 343 54
proudly. 1 343 54

This 1 343 55
is 1 343 55
what 1 343 55
the 1 343 55
Church 1 343 55
of 1 343 55
Accompaniment 1 343 55
is 1 343 55
all 1 343 55
about! 1 343 55

But, 0 343 56
practically 0 343 56
speaking--in 0 343 56
the 0 343 56
real 0 343 56
world--this 0 343 56
kind 0 343 56
of 0 343 56
"accompaniment" 0 343 56
is 0 343 56
only 0 343 56
green-lighting 1 343 56
vice 1 343 56
and 1 343 56
mortal 1 343 56
sin, 1 343 56
and 0 343 56
as 0 343 56
such 0 343 56
constitutes 0 343 56
a 1 343 56
hideous 1 343 56
violation 1 343 56
of 1 343 56
everything 1 343 56
these 1 343 56
bishops 1 343 56
supposedly 1 343 56
believe 1 343 56
as 1 343 56
Catholic 1 343 56
priests. 1 343 56

So 0 343 57
what's 0 343 57
going 0 343 57
on 0 343 57
here? 0 343 57

Who 1 343 58
are 1 343 58
these 1 343 58
bishops 1 343 58
that 1 343 58
think 1 343 58
they 1 343 58
can 1 343 58
play 1 343 58
fast 1 343 58
and 1 343 58
loose 1 343 58
not 1 343 58
only 1 343 58
with 1 343 58
the 1 343 58
moral 1 343 58
theology 1 343 58
of 1 343 58
the 1 343 58
Catholic 1 343 58
Church, 1 343 58
but 1 343 58
also 1 343 58
with 1 343 58
the 1 343 58
immortal 1 343 58
souls 1 343 58
of 1 343 58
their 1 343 58
flock? 1 343 58

Is 1 343 59
it 1 343 59
any 1 343 59
wonder 1 343 59
that 1 343 59
priests 1 343 59
and 1 343 59
laity 1 343 59
alike 1 343 59
are 1 343 59
changing 1 343 59
their 1 343 59
attitude 1 343 59
on 1 343 59
the 1 343 59
"gay 1 343 59
lifestyle" 1 343 59
and 1 343 59
violations 1 343 59
of 1 343 59
the 1 343 59
Sixth 1 343 59
Commandment 1 343 59
when 1 343 59
so 1 343 59
many 1 343 59
bishops 1 343 59
are 1 343 59
working 1 343 59
to 1 343 59
remove 1 343 59
the 1 343 59
stigma 1 343 59
attached 1 343 59
to 1 343 59
this 1 343 59
sin 1 343 59
that 1 343 59
Scripture 1 343 59
tells 1 343 59
us 1 343 59
cries 1 343 59
to 1 343 59
heaven 1 343 59
for 1 343 59
vengeance? 1 343 59

The 1 343 60
Catholic 1 343 60
Church's 1 343 60
new-found 1 343 60
"climate 1 343 60
of 1 343 60
tolerance" 1 343 60
is 1 343 60
exactly 1 343 60
what 1 343 60
McCarrick 1 343 60
and 1 343 60
company 1 343 60
are 1 343 60
counting 1 343 60
on! 1 343 60

It 1 343 61
is 1 343 61
truly 1 343 61
homophobic 1 343 61
for 1 343 61
any 1 343 61
bishop 1 343 61
to 1 343 61
lie 1 343 61
to 1 343 61
the 1 343 61
gay 1 343 61
community 1 343 61
about 1 343 61
this, 1 343 61
and 1 343 61
to 1 343 61
risk 1 343 61
the 1 343 61
immortal 1 343 61
souls 1 343 61
of 1 343 61
the 1 343 61
sheep 1 343 61
merely 1 343 61
so 1 343 61
that 1 343 61
the 1 343 61
shepherd 1 343 61
might 1 343 61
pride 1 343 61
himself 1 343 61
on 1 343 61
occupying 1 343 61
the 1 343 61
politically 1 343 61
correct 1 343 61
high 1 343 61
ground. 1 343 61

This 1 343 62
is 1 343 62
gross 1 343 62
dereliction 1 343 62
of 1 343 62
duty, 1 343 62
and 1 343 62
we 1 343 62
hope 1 343 62
and 1 343 62
pray 1 343 62
that 1 343 62
all 1 343 62
the 1 343 62
good 1 343 62
U.S. 1 343 62
bishops 1 343 62
would 1 343 62
jump 1 343 62
at 1 343 62
the 1 343 62
opportunity 1 343 62
to 1 343 62
issue 1 343 62
statements 1 343 62
reaffirming 1 343 62
the 1 343 62
Church's 1 343 62
clear 1 343 62
teaching 1 343 62
against 1 343 62
all 1 343 62
sins 1 343 62
of 1 343 62
the 1 343 62
flesh, 1 343 62
homo- 1 343 62
and 1 343 62
heterosexual. 1 343 62

Again, 0 343 63
God 0 343 63
bless 0 343 63
Archbishop 0 343 63
Hebda 0 343 63
for 0 343 63
this 0 343 63
welcome 0 343 63
statement, 0 343 63
and 0 343 63
may 0 343 63
God 0 343 63
grant 0 343 63
him 0 343 63
the 0 343 63
courage 0 343 63
now 0 343 63
to 0 343 63
finish 0 343 63
the 0 343 63
task 0 343 63
by 0 343 63
publicly 0 343 63
reassuring 0 343 63
the 1 343 63
scandalized 1 343 63
faithful 1 343 63
that 0 343 63
it’s 0 343 63
not 0 343 63
just 0 343 63
abuse 0 343 63
of 0 343 63
minors 0 343 63
or 0 343 63
sexual 0 343 63
harassment 0 343 63
that’s 0 343 63
going 0 343 63
on 0 343 63
here. 0 343 63

Our 1 343 64
bishops 1 343 64
must 1 343 64
make 1 343 64
it 1 343 64
absolutely 1 343 64
clear 1 343 64
that 1 343 64
the 1 343 64
Church's 1 343 64
moral 1 343 64
theology 1 343 64
on 1 343 64
homosexuality 1 343 64
will 1 343 64
not 1 343 64
and 1 343 64
can 1 343 64
not 1 343 64
be 1 343 64
trumped 1 343 64
by 1 343 64
the 1 343 64
dictates 1 343 64
of 1 343 64
political 1 343 64
correctness. 1 343 64

And 0 343 65
neither 0 343 65
can 0 343 65
God's 0 343 65
law 0 343 65
be 0 343 65
changed 0 343 65
to 0 343 65
accommodate 0 343 65
the 0 343 65
spirit 0 343 65
of 0 343 65
our 0 343 65
“most 0 343 65
enlightened” 0 343 65
age---which 0 343 65
is, 0 343 65
of 0 343 65
course, 0 343 65
an 1 343 65
evil 1 343 65
spirit 1 343 65
that 1 343 65
can 1 343 65
be 1 343 65
driven 1 343 65
out 1 343 65
only 1 343 65
by 1 343 65
prayer 1 343 65
and 1 343 65
fasting. 1 343 65

Until 1 343 66
the 1 343 66
Church 1 343 66
and 1 343 66
her 1 343 66
bishops 1 343 66
get 1 343 66
back 1 343 66
to 1 343 66
reaffirming 1 343 66
traditional 1 343 66
Catholic 1 343 66
teaching 1 343 66
on 1 343 66
human 1 343 66
sexuality 1 343 66
we 1 343 66
can 1 343 66
forget 1 343 66
about 1 343 66
seeing 1 343 66
an 1 343 66
end 1 343 66
to 1 343 66
the 1 343 66
sexual 1 343 66
abuse 1 343 66
crisis 1 343 66
and 1 343 66
the 1 343 66
massive 1 343 66
problem 1 343 66
of 1 343 66
homosexuality 1 343 66
in 1 343 66
the 1 343 66
clergy. 1 343 66

McCarrick 0 343 67
will 0 343 67
become 0 343 67
the 0 343 67
norm, 0 343 67
not 0 343 67
the 0 343 67
exception, 0 343 67
and 0 343 67
confidence 0 343 67
in 0 343 67
the 0 343 67
leadership 0 343 67
and 0 343 67
moral 0 343 67
authority 0 343 67
of 0 343 67
the 0 343 67
Catholic 0 343 67
Church 0 343 67
will 1 343 67
remain 1 343 67
in 1 343 67
the 1 343 67
toilet 1 343 67
indefinitely... 1 343 67
exactly 0 343 67
as 0 343 67
the 1 343 67
forces 1 343 67
of 1 343 67
darkness 1 343 67
intended 0 343 67
all 0 343 67
along. 0 343 67

Anti-Israel 0 345 25

whining 1 345 27
that 0 345 27
boycotting 0 345 27

is 0 345 27
a 0 345 27
violation 0 345 27

Jewishness 0 345 27

Hannity 0 347 33
on 0 347 33
Thursday 0 347 33
night 0 347 33
and 0 347 33
asked, 0 347 33
"Since 0 347 33
when 0 347 33
does 0 347 33
truth 0 347 33
and 0 347 33
justice 0 347 33
or 0 347 33
guilt 0 347 33
and 0 347 33

depend 0 347 33
on 0 347 33
your 0 347 33

party. 0 347 33

I 1 347 34
fear 1 347 34
for 1 347 34
this 1 347 34
nation 1 347 34
when 1 347 34
this 1 347 34
is 1 347 34
now 1 347 34
the 1 347 34
standard. 1 347 34

You 1 347 35
believe 1 347 35
any 1 347 35
woman 1 347 35
who 1 347 35
goes 1 347 35
against 1 347 35

you 1 347 35
don't 1 347 35
believe 1 347 35
any 1 347 35
woman 1 347 35
who 1 347 35
goes 1 347 35
against 1 347 35
a 1 347 35
Democrat." 1 347 35

She 0 347 36
continued. 0 347 36

"I 0 347 37
worry 1 347 37
about 1 347 37
this 1 347 37
country. 1 347 37

I 0 347 38
don't 0 347 38
want 0 347 38
these 0 347 38
people 0 347 38
to 0 347 38
sit 0 347 38

juries. 0 347 38

It's 0 347 39
no 0 347 39
longer 0 347 39
about 0 347 39
truth 0 347 39
and 0 347 39
justice. 0 347 39

It's 0 347 40
about 0 347 40
politics." 0 347 40

Hannity 0 347 41
asks, 0 347 41
"Why 0 347 41
are 0 347 41
people 0 347 41
willing 0 347 41
to 0 347 41
throw 0 347 41
out 0 347 41
due 0 347 41
process, 0 347 41
equal 0 347 41
justice 0 347 41
under 0 347 41
the 0 347 41
law 0 347 41
and 0 347 41
the 0 347 41
presumption 0 347 41
of 0 347 41
innocence?" 0 347 41

Gregg 0 347 42
Jarrett 0 347 42
says 0 347 42
it's 0 347 42
"because 0 347 42
they're 1 347 42
zealous 1 347 42
to 0 347 42
the 0 347 42
point 0 347 42
where 0 347 42
they've 0 347 42
lost 0 347 42
their 0 347 42
common 0 347 42
sense." 0 347 42

Their 0 347 43
commentary 0 347 43
on 0 347 43
the 0 347 43
video 0 347 43
below 0 347 43
is 0 347 43
interesting. 0 347 43

Sen. 0 347 44
Charles 0 347 44
Grassley 0 347 44
(R-IA) 0 347 44
is 0 347 44
to 0 347 44
be 0 347 44
commended 0 347 44
on 0 347 44
his 0 347 44
handling 0 347 44
of 0 347 44
the 0 347 44
situation. 0 347 44

In 0 347 45
the 0 347 45
spirit 0 347 45
of 0 347 45
compromise, 0 347 45
he 0 347 45
called 0 347 45
off 0 347 45
the 0 347 45
Senate 0 347 45
committee 0 347 45
vote 0 347 45
that 0 347 45
had 0 347 45
been 0 347 45
on 0 347 45
the 0 347 45
calendar 0 347 45
for 0 347 45
Thursday 0 347 45
and 0 347 45
scheduled 0 347 45
a 0 347 45
hearing 0 347 45
for 0 347 45
next 0 347 45
Monday 0 347 45
so 0 347 45
that 0 347 45
both 0 347 45
Christine 0 347 45
Ford 0 347 45
and 0 347 45
Brett 0 347 45
Kavanaugh 0 347 45
could 0 347 45
state 0 347 45
their 0 347 45
cases. 0 347 45

Kavanaugh 0 347 46
immediately 0 347 46
responded 0 347 46
to 0 347 46
Grassley. 0 347 46

For 0 347 47
36 0 347 47
hours, 0 347 47
there 0 347 47
was 0 347 47
silence 0 347 47
from 0 347 47
the 0 347 47
Ford 0 347 47
camp. 0 347 47

Then, 0 347 48
their 0 347 48
demands 0 347 48
began. 0 347 48

First, 0 347 49
it 0 347 49
was 0 347 49
reported 0 347 49
that 0 347 49
Ford 0 347 49
would 0 347 49
answer 0 347 49
questions, 0 347 49
but 0 347 49
only 0 347 49
at 0 347 49
a 0 347 49
closed 0 347 49
hearing 0 347 49
and 0 347 49
only 0 347 49
after 0 347 49
an 0 347 49
FBI 0 347 49
investigation 0 347 49
had 0 347 49
been 0 347 49
completed. 0 347 49

Republicans 0 347 50
felt 0 347 50
that 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
request 0 347 50
for 0 347 50
a 0 347 50
closed 0 347 50
hearing 0 347 50
was 0 347 50
reasonable, 0 347 50
but 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
demand 0 347 50
for 0 347 50
a 0 347 50
new 0 347 50
FBI 0 347 50
investigation 0 347 50
was 0 347 50
not. 0 347 50

The 0 347 51
FBI 0 347 51
investigates 0 347 51
federal 0 347 51
crimes 0 347 51
and/or 0 347 51
national 0 347 51
security 0 347 51
issues. 0 347 51

When 0 347 52
the 0 347 52

last 0 347 52
week, 0 347 52

it 0 347 52

recent 0 347 53
one 0 347 53
was 0 347 53
done 0 347 53
this 0 347 53
summer.) 0 347 53

It 0 347 54
was 0 347 54
announced 0 347 54
later 0 347 54
that 0 347 54
Sen. 0 347 54
Grassley 0 347 54
would 0 347 54
not 0 347 54
change 0 347 54
the 0 347 54
date 0 347 54
of 0 347 54
the 0 347 54

set 0 347 54
for 0 347 54
Monday. 0 347 54

Even 0 347 55
Senators 0 347 55

who 0 347 55
have 0 347 55
all 0 347 55
said 0 347 55
Ford 0 347 55
needs 0 347 55
to 0 347 55
be 0 347 55
heard, 0 347 55
have 0 347 55
indicated 0 347 55
that 0 347 55
if 0 347 55
she 0 347 55
does 0 347 55
not 0 347 55
show 0 347 55
up 0 347 55
for 0 347 55
Monday's 0 347 55
hearing, 0 347 55
they 0 347 55
will 0 347 55
schedule 0 347 55
a 0 347 55
vote 0 347 55
on 0 347 55
Kavanaugh's 0 347 55
confirmation. 0 347 55

On 0 347 56
Thursday 0 347 56
afternoon, 0 347 56
Ford's 0 347 56
highly 1 347 56
partisan, 1 347 56
activist 1 347 56
attorney 1 347 56
emailed 0 347 56
Grassley 0 347 56
saying, 0 347 56
although 0 347 56
her 0 347 56
client 0 347 56
strongly 0 347 56
prefers 0 347 56
that 0 347 56
an 0 347 56
investigation 0 347 56
take 0 347 56
place 0 347 56
beforehand, 0 347 56
Ford 0 347 56
will 0 347 56
testify 0 347 56
next 0 347 56
week, 0 347 56
but 0 347 56
she 0 347 56
cannot 0 347 56
do 0 347 56
so 0 347 56
on 0 347 56
Monday. 0 347 56

And 0 347 57
she 0 347 57
will 0 347 57
only 0 347 57
be 0 347 57
questioned 0 347 57
by 0 347 57
members 0 347 57
of 0 347 57
the 0 347 57
Senate 0 347 57
panel, 0 347 57
not 0 347 57
outside 0 347 57
lawyers. 0 347 57

Why 1 347 58
not 1 347 58
Monday? 1 347 58

Does 1 347 59
she 1 347 59
have 1 347 59
an 1 347 59
important 1 347 59
dentist 1 347 59
appointment 1 347 59
she 1 347 59
can't 1 347 59
get 1 347 59
out 1 347 59
of? 1 347 59

In 0 347 60
order 0 347 60
to 0 347 60
avoid 0 347 60
the 0 347 60
criticism 0 347 60
that 0 347 60
will 0 347 60
no 0 347 60
doubt 0 347 60
come 0 347 60
anyway, 0 347 60
the 0 347 60
Republicans 0 347 60
on 0 347 60
the 0 347 60
Senate 0 347 60
Judicial 0 347 60
committee 0 347 60
have 0 347 60
tried 0 347 60
very 0 347 60
hard 0 347 60
to 0 347 60
oblige 0 347 60
Ford's 0 347 60
requests, 0 347 60
even 0 347 60
offering 0 347 60
to 0 347 60
go 0 347 60
to 0 347 60
California 0 347 60
to 0 347 60
hear 0 347 60
her 0 347 60
testimony. 0 347 60

She 0 347 61
and 0 347 61
her 0 347 61
attorneys 0 347 61
feel 0 347 61
that 0 347 61
they 0 347 61
are 0 347 61
in 0 347 61
the 0 347 61
driver's 0 347 61
seat 0 347 61
and 0 347 61
thus, 0 347 61
can 0 347 61
call 0 347 61
all 0 347 61
the 0 347 61
shots. 0 347 61

Democrats 1 347 62
want 1 347 62
to 1 347 62
delay 1 347 62
this 1 347 62
vote 1 347 62
until 1 347 62
after 1 347 62
the 1 347 62
midterms 1 347 62
because 1 347 62
they 1 347 62
believe 1 347 62
they 1 347 62
have 1 347 62
a 1 347 62
chance 1 347 62
to 1 347 62
retake 1 347 62
the 1 347 62
Senate 1 347 62
as 1 347 62
well 1 347 62
as 1 347 62
the 1 347 62
House. 1 347 62

Rush 0 347 63
Limbaugh 0 347 63
points 0 347 63
out 0 347 63
that 0 347 63
the 0 347 63
Senate 0 347 63
has 0 347 63
bent 1 347 63
over 1 347 63
backwards 1 347 63
to 0 347 63
accommodate 0 347 63
the 0 347 63
accuser. 0 347 63

"I 0 347 64
don’t 1 347 64
care 1 347 64
who 1 347 64
you 1 347 64
are, 1 347 64
determine 0 347 64
the 0 347 64
scope 0 347 64
and 0 347 64
the 0 347 64
parameters 0 347 64
of 0 347 64
an 0 347 64
investigation. 0 347 64

The 0 347 65
accuser 0 347 65
doesn’t 0 347 65
get 0 347 65
to 0 347 65
determine 0 347 65
when 0 347 65
and 0 347 65
who 0 347 65
investigates. 0 347 65

In 1 347 66
no 1 347 66
circumstance 1 347 66
in 1 347 66
the 1 347 66
country 1 347 66
does 1 347 66
that 1 347 66
happen." 1 347 66

In 0 347 67
addition 0 347 67
to 0 347 67
the 0 347 67
political 0 347 67
reasons 0 347 67
for 0 347 67
the 0 347 67
delay 0 347 67
requests, 0 347 67
it 0 347 67
appears 0 347 67
as 0 347 67
if 0 347 67
this 0 347 67
woman 0 347 67
is 0 347 67
reluctant 0 347 67
to 0 347 67
testify 0 347 67
under 0 347 67
oath, 0 347 67
possibly 0 347 67
because 0 347 67
she 0 347 67
doesn’t 0 347 67
want 0 347 67
to 0 347 67
perjure 0 347 67
herself. 0 347 67

Maybe 0 347 68
she 0 347 68
realizes 0 347 68
the 0 347 68
magnitude 0 347 68
of 0 347 68
what 0 347 68
her 0 347 68
accusations 0 347 68
have 0 347 68
unleashed. 0 347 68

Either 0 347 69
this 0 347 69
did 0 347 69
not 0 347 69
happen 0 347 69
at 0 347 69
all 0 347 69
or 0 347 69
a 0 347 69
much 0 347 69
milder 0 347 69
version 0 347 69
of 0 347 69
the 0 347 69
situation 0 347 69
she 0 347 69
alleges 0 347 69
occurred. 0 347 69

Kavanaugh 0 347 70
may 0 347 70
have 0 347 70
made 0 347 70
a 0 347 70
pass 0 347 70
at 0 347 70
her 0 347 70
as 0 347 70
17-year-old 0 347 70
boys 0 347 70
(and 0 347 70
even 0 347 70
some 0 347 70
17-year-old 0 347 70
girls) 0 347 70
are 0 347 70
known 0 347 70
to 0 347 70
do. 0 347 70

Ford 0 347 71
said 0 347 71
no 0 347 71
and 0 347 71
that 0 347 71
was 0 347 71
it. 0 347 71

Even 0 347 72
she 0 347 72
admits, 0 347 72
they 0 347 72
did 0 347 72
not 0 347 72
have 0 347 72
sex, 0 347 72
nor 0 347 72
was 0 347 72
this 0 347 72
a 0 347 72
hostage 0 347 72
situation. 0 347 72

The 0 347 73
perception 0 347 73
of 0 347 73
events 0 347 73
by 0 347 73
a 0 347 73
15-year-old 0 347 73
girl 0 347 73
may 0 347 73
differ 0 347 73
significantly 0 347 73
from 0 347 73
reality. 0 347 73

And 0 347 74
36 0 347 74
years 0 347 74
can 0 347 74
distort 0 347 74
memories, 0 347 74
one 0 347 74
way 0 347 74
or 0 347 74
another. 0 347 74

What 1 347 75
is 1 347 75
happening 1 347 75
in 1 347 75
the 1 347 75
Brett 1 347 75
Kavanaugh 1 347 75
nomination 1 347 75
process 1 347 75
should 1 347 75
concern 1 347 75
every 1 347 75
American. 1 347 75

Whatever 0 347 76
happened 0 347 76
or 0 347 76
did 0 347 76
not 0 347 76
happen, 0 347 76
it's 0 347 76
difficult 0 347 76
to 0 347 76
feel 0 347 76
sorry 0 347 76
for 0 347 76
someone 0 347 76
who 0 347 76
comes 0 347 76
forward 0 347 76
at 0 347 76
such 0 347 76
a 0 347 76
politically 0 347 76
opportune 0 347 76
moment. 0 347 76

There 0 347 77
was 0 347 77
ample 0 347 77
time 0 347 77
to 0 347 77
have 0 347 77
addressed 0 347 77
this 0 347 77
in 0 347 77
July 0 347 77
or 0 347 77
August, 0 347 77
but 0 347 77
Dianne 0 347 77
Feinstein 0 347 77
chose 1 347 77
to 1 347 77
sit 1 347 77
on 1 347 77
it 1 347 77
until 1 347 77
the 1 347 77
moment 1 347 77
it 1 347 77
could 1 347 77
inflict 1 347 77
maximum 1 347 77
political 1 347 77
damage. 1 347 77

Democrats 0 347 78
may 0 347 78
be 0 347 78
overestimating 0 347 78
the 0 347 78
strength 0 347 78
of 0 347 78
their 0 347 78
hand. 0 347 78

And 0 347 79
Ms. 0 347 79
Ford 0 347 79
may 0 347 79
be 0 347 79
overestimating 1 347 79
the 1 347 79
integrity 1 347 79
of 1 347 79
the 1 347 79
"supportive" 1 347 79
lawmakers 1 347 79
and 1 347 79
lawyers 1 347 79
currently 1 347 79
handling 1 347 79
her. 1 347 79

Watch 0 347 80
all 0 347 80
these 0 347 80
sensitive 1 347 80
lawmakers 1 347 80
and 1 347 80
high 1 347 80
profile, 1 347 80
activist 1 347 80
attorneys 1 347 80
scatter 1 347 80
like 1 347 80
mice 1 347 80
from 0 347 80

once 0 347 80
the 0 347 80

(regardless 0 347 80
of 0 347 80
the 0 347 80
result). 0 347 80

Ford 0 347 81
can 0 347 81
choose 0 347 81
to 0 347 81
state 0 347 81
her 0 347 81

on 0 347 81
Monday 0 347 81
or 0 347 81
not, 0 347 81

not 0 347 81
in 0 347 81
a 0 347 81

Like 0 348 9
this. 0 348 9

Farrakhan 1 348 10
had 1 348 10
praised 1 348 10
Hitler 1 348 10
and 1 348 10
declared 1 348 10
that 1 348 10
the 1 348 10
Jews, 1 348 10
"can't 1 348 10
say 1 348 10
'Never 1 348 10
Again' 1 348 10
to 1 348 10
God, 1 348 10
because 1 348 10
when 1 348 10
he 1 348 10
puts 1 348 10
you 1 348 10

you're 1 348 10
there 1 348 10
forever.” 1 348 10

"Here 1 348 11
come 1 348 11
the 1 348 11
Jews. 1 348 11

They 1 348 12
don't 1 348 12
like 1 348 12
Farrakhan, 1 348 12
so 1 348 12
they 1 348 12
call 1 348 12
me 1 348 12

Well, 1 348 13
that's 1 348 13
a 1 348 13

very 1 348 14
great 1 348 14
man." 1 348 14

Saris 0 349 24
just 0 349 24
does 0 349 24
not 0 349 24
accept 0 349 24
that 0 349 24
the 0 349 24
immigration 0 349 24

found 0 349 24
no 0 349 24

for 0 349 24
their 0 349 24
claim 0 349 24
of 0 349 24
persecution, 0 349 24
and 0 349 24
there 0 349 24
is 0 349 24
no 0 349 24
evidence 0 349 24
that 0 349 24
they 0 349 24

today. 0 349 24

She 0 349 25
and 0 349 25

acted 0 349 25
outside 0 349 25

something 0 349 25
that 0 349 25

that 0 349 25
is 0 349 25
not 0 349 25
Kritarch 0 349 25
Saris' 0 349 25

The 0 349 26

that 0 349 26

is 0 349 26
no 0 349 26

document 0 354 11
he 0 354 11
and 0 354 11
Kim 0 354 11
signed 0 354 11
said 0 354 11
the 0 354 11
North 0 354 11
Korean 0 354 11
leader 0 354 11
"reaffirmed 0 354 11
his 0 354 11
firm 0 354 11
and 0 354 11
unwavering 1 354 11
commitment 0 354 11
to 0 354 11
complete 0 354 11
denuclearization 0 354 11
of 0 354 11
the 0 354 11
Korean 0 354 11
Peninsula." 0 354 11

In 0 354 12
exchange, 0 354 12
Trump 0 354 12
agreed 0 354 12
to 0 354 12
"provide 0 354 12
security 0 354 12
guarantees" 0 354 12
to 0 354 12
North 0 354 12
Korea. 0 354 12

But 0 354 13
there 0 354 13
was 0 354 13
no 0 354 13
mentioning 0 354 13
the 0 354 13
previous 0 354 13
US 0 354 13
aim 0 354 13
of 0 354 13
"complete, 0 354 13
verifiable 0 354 13
and 0 354 13
irreversible 0 354 13
denuclearization." 0 354 13

And 0 354 14
Kim's 0 354 14
commitments 0 354 14
did 0 354 14
not 0 354 14
appear 0 354 14
to 0 354 14
go 0 354 14
beyond 0 354 14
what 0 354 14
he 0 354 14
already 0 354 14
pledged 0 354 14
to 0 354 14
do 0 354 14
in 0 354 14
April 0 354 14
when 0 354 14
he 0 354 14
met 0 354 14
South 0 354 14
Korean 0 354 14
President 0 354 14

along 0 354 14
their 0 354 14
countries' 0 354 14
border. 0 354 14

Trump 0 354 15
insisted 0 354 15
during 0 354 15
a 0 354 15
news 0 354 15
conference 0 354 15
the 0 354 15
agreement 0 354 15
went 0 354 15
further 0 354 15
than 0 354 15
many 0 354 15
people 0 354 15
expected. 0 354 15

But 0 354 16
he 0 354 16
acknowledged 0 354 16
the 0 354 16
effort 0 354 16
to 0 354 16
rid 0 354 16
North 0 354 16
Korea 0 354 16
of 0 354 16
its 0 354 16
nuclear 0 354 16
arsenal 0 354 16
was 0 354 16
in 0 354 16
its 0 354 16
early 0 354 16
stages. 0 354 16

"We 0 354 17
will 0 354 17
do 0 354 17
it 0 354 17
as 0 354 17
fast 0 354 17
as 0 354 17
it 0 354 17
can 0 354 17
mechanically 0 354 17
and 0 354 17
physically 0 354 17
be 0 354 17
done," 0 354 17
he 0 354 17
said. 0 354 17

More 0 354 18
critical, 0 354 18
in 0 354 18
Trump's 0 354 18
telling, 0 354 18
was 0 354 18
the 0 354 18
development 0 354 18
of 0 354 18
a 0 354 18
personal 0 354 18
bond 0 354 18
with 0 354 18
Kim, 0 354 18
a 0 354 18
brutal 1 354 18
dictator 1 354 18
responsible 0 354 18
for 0 354 18
the 0 354 18
deaths 0 354 18
not 0 354 18
only 0 354 18
of 0 354 18
his 0 354 18
own 0 354 18
citizens 0 354 18
but 0 354 18
of 0 354 18
at 0 354 18

one 0 354 18
American, 0 354 18
Otto 0 354 18
Warmbier, 0 354 18
who 0 354 18

to 0 354 18
die 0 354 18
days 0 354 18
later. 0 354 18

"I 0 354 19

our 0 354 19
whole 0 354 19

much 0 354 19
different 0 354 19

it 0 354 19
has 0 354 19
in 0 354 19
the 0 354 19

Trump 0 354 19

during 0 354 19
the 0 354 19
summit. 0 354 19

Later, 0 354 20
during 0 354 20
his 0 354 20
news 0 354 20
conference, 0 354 20
Trump 0 354 20
said 0 354 20
Warmbier's 0 354 20
death 0 354 20
contributed 0 354 20
to 0 354 20
the 0 354 20
summit 0 354 20
taking 0 354 20
place. 0 354 20

"Without 0 354 21
Otto, 0 354 21
this 0 354 21
would 0 354 21
not 0 354 21

happened," 0 354 21
Trump 0 354 21

Trump 0 354 22
and 0 354 22
Kim 0 354 22

both 0 354 22

greeted 0 354 22
each 0 354 22
other 0 354 22
early 0 354 22
in 0 354 22
the 0 354 22

with 0 354 22
extended 0 354 22
hands 0 354 22
in 0 354 22
front 0 354 22
of 0 354 22
a 0 354 22
row 0 354 22
of 0 354 22
US 0 354 22
and 0 354 22
North 0 354 22
Korean 0 354 22
flags, 0 354 22
a 0 354 22
previously 0 354 22
unthinkable 1 354 22
sight 0 354 22
that 0 354 22
reflects 0 354 22
a 0 354 22
new 0 354 22
chapter 0 354 22
in 0 354 22
the 0 354 22
two 0 354 22
countries' 0 354 22
acrimonious 1 354 22
relationship. 0 354 22

Trump's 0 354 23
threats 0 354 23
to 0 354 23
politely 0 354 23
walk 0 354 23
out 0 354 23
of 0 354 23
the 0 354 23
meeting 0 354 23
if 0 354 23
his 0 354 23
expectations 0 354 23
were 0 354 23
unmet 0 354 23
did 0 354 23
not 0 354 23
materialize. 0 354 23

Instead 0 354 24
he 0 354 24
predicted 0 354 24
he 0 354 24
could 0 354 24
"solve 0 354 24
a 0 354 24
big 1 354 24
problem, 1 354 24
a 0 354 24

alongside 0 354 24
his 0 354 24
new 0 354 24
partner. 0 354 24

"Working 1 354 25
together, 1 354 25
we'll 1 354 25
get 1 354 25
it 1 354 25
taken 1 354 25
care 1 354 25
of," 1 354 25
Trump 0 354 25
said. 0 354 25

The 0 354 26
remarks 0 354 26
came 0 354 26
amid 0 354 26
an 0 354 26
improbable 0 354 26
series 0 354 26
of 0 354 26
events 0 354 26
that 0 354 26
few 0 354 26
could 0 354 26

counterparts 0 354 27
engaging 0 354 27
in 0 354 27
friendly 0 354 27
dialogue 0 354 27
lent 0 354 27
the 0 354 27
day 0 354 27
an 0 354 27
air 0 354 27
of 0 354 27
unreality. 0 354 27

In 0 354 28
a 0 354 28
detailed 0 354 28
menu, 0 354 28
the 0 354 28
White 0 354 28
House 0 354 28

Other 0 354 29
unforeseen 0 354 29
events 0 354 29
also 0 354 29
surrounded 0 354 29
the 0 354 29
summit, 0 354 29
increasing 1 354 29
the 1 354 29
drama. 1 354 29

Minutes 0 354 30
before 0 354 30
the 0 354 30
historic 1 354 30
handshake, 0 354 30
Trump 0 354 30
tweeted 0 354 30
that 0 354 30

top 0 354 30
economic 0 354 30

had 0 354 30
suffered 0 354 30
a 0 354 30
heart 0 354 30
attack. 0 354 30

Immediately 0 354 31
after 0 354 31
the 0 354 31
encounter, 0 354 31
Dennis 0 354 31
Rodman 0 354 31
-- 0 354 31
one 0 354 31
of 0 354 31

openly 0 354 31
weeping 0 354 31
while 0 354 31
being 0 354 31
interviewed 0 354 31
by 0 354 31
CNN's 0 354 31
Chris 0 354 31
Cuomo. 0 354 31

Even 0 354 32
Kim 0 354 32
seemed 0 354 32
to 0 354 32
acknowledge 0 354 32
the 0 354 32
surreality 1 354 32
of 0 354 32
the 0 354 32
day. 0 354 32

"Many 0 354 33
people 0 354 33
in 0 354 33
the 0 354 33
world 0 354 33
will 0 354 33
think 0 354 33
of 0 354 33

from 0 354 33
a 0 354 33
science 0 354 33
fiction 0 354 33
movie," 0 354 33
his 0 354 33
translator 0 354 33
was 0 354 33
overheard 0 354 33
saying 0 354 33
as 0 354 33
the 0 354 33
two 0 354 33
leaders 0 354 33
walked 0 354 33
down 0 354 33
a 0 354 33
white-columned 0 354 33
colonnade. 0 354 33

At 0 354 34
the 0 354 34
conclusion 0 354 34
of 0 354 34
the 0 354 34
summit, 0 354 34
Trump 0 354 34
hailed 1 354 34
the 0 354 34
talks 0 354 34
as 0 354 34
a 0 354 34
historic, 1 354 34
and 0 354 34
personal, 0 354 34
achievement. 0 354 34

"We 0 354 35
learned 0 354 35
a 0 354 35
lot 0 354 35
about 0 354 35

other 0 354 35
and 0 354 35
our 0 354 35
countries," 0 354 35
Trump 0 354 35
said. 0 354 35

"I 0 354 36
learned 0 354 36
he's 0 354 36
a 0 354 36
very 1 354 36
talented 1 354 36
man." 1 354 36

When 0 354 37
pressed 0 354 37
about 0 354 37
those 0 354 37
comments 0 354 37
in 0 354 37
light 0 354 37
of 0 354 37
Kim's 0 354 37
brutal 1 354 37
tactics, 0 354 37
Trump 0 354 37
continued 0 354 37
praising 1 354 37
the 0 354 37
North 0 354 37
Korean 0 354 37
leaders' 0 354 37
ability 0 354 37
to 0 354 37
run 0 354 37
a 0 354 37
country 0 354 37
at 0 354 37
a 0 354 37
young 0 354 37
age. 0 354 37

"He 0 354 38
is 0 354 38
very 1 354 38
talented," 1 354 38
Trump 0 354 38
said, 0 354 38
citing 0 354 38
Kim's 0 354 38
ability 0 354 38
to 0 354 38
"take 0 354 38
over 0 354 38
a 0 354 38
situation 0 354 38
like 0 354 38
he 0 354 38
did 0 354 38
at 0 354 38
26 0 354 38
years 0 354 38
of 0 354 38
age 0 354 38

run 0 354 38
it, 0 354 38
and 0 354 38
run 0 354 38
it 0 354 38
tough." 0 354 38

Kim 0 354 39
assumed 0 354 39
power 0 354 39
after 0 354 39
his 0 354 39
father 0 354 39
Kim 0 354 39
Jong 0 354 39
Il, 0 354 39
also 0 354 39
a 0 354 39
brutal 1 354 39
dictator, 1 354 39
died 0 354 39
in 0 354 39
2011. 0 354 39

Throughout 0 354 40
the 0 354 40
day, 0 354 40
Trump 0 354 40
and 0 354 40
Kim's 0 354 40
body 0 354 40
language 0 354 40
was 0 354 40
openly 0 354 40
friendly, 0 354 40
a 0 354 40
striking 1 354 40
warmth 0 354 40
given 0 354 40
Kim's 0 354 40
iron 0 354 40
grip 0 354 40
on 0 354 40
power 0 354 40
and 0 354 40
dismal 0 354 40
record 0 354 40
on 0 354 40
human 0 354 40
rights. 0 354 40

Trump's 0 354 41
move 0 354 41
to 0 354 41
meet 0 354 41
him 0 354 41
attracted 0 354 41
fierce 1 354 41
criticism 1 354 41
for 0 354 41
normalizing 0 354 41
a 0 354 41
regime 0 354 41
routinely 0 354 41
called 0 354 41
out 0 354 41
for 0 354 41
its 0 354 41
human 0 354 41
rights 0 354 41
abuses, 0 354 41
that 0 354 41
over 0 354 41
years 0 354 41
has 0 354 41
built 0 354 41
an 0 354 41
image 0 354 41
of 0 354 41
fearsome 1 354 41
renegade 1 354 41
regime, 0 354 41
throwing 0 354 41
around 0 354 41
threats 0 354 41
of 0 354 41
nuclear 0 354 41
war. 0 354 41

The 0 354 42
day 0 354 42
began 0 354 42
with 0 354 42
Trump 0 354 42
patting 0 354 42
Kim 0 354 42
on 0 354 42
the 0 354 42
back 0 354 42
and 0 354 42
placing 0 354 42
his 0 354 42
hand 0 354 42
on 0 354 42
the 0 354 42
North 0 354 42
Korean's 0 354 42

as 0 354 42
they 0 354 42
walked 0 354 42
into 0 354 42
their 0 354 42
first 0 354 42
meeting. 0 354 42

Later 0 354 43
they 0 354 43
were 0 354 43
seen 0 354 43
smiling 0 354 43
and 0 354 43
laughing 0 354 43
over 0 354 43
lunch. 0 354 43

Trump 0 354 44
told 0 354 44
reporters 0 354 44
he 0 354 44
would 0 354 44
"absolutely" 1 354 44
extend 0 354 44
an 0 354 44
invitation 0 354 44
to 0 354 44
the 0 354 44
White 0 354 44
House 0 354 44
to 0 354 44
Kim, 0 354 44
who 0 354 44
also 0 354 44
heralded 1 354 44
a 1 354 44
new 1 354 44
era. 1 354 44

"Today, 0 354 45
we 0 354 45
had 0 354 45
a 0 354 45
historic 1 354 45
meeting 0 354 45
and 0 354 45
decided 0 354 45
to 0 354 45
leave 0 354 45
the 0 354 45
past 0 354 45
behind," 0 354 45
Kim 0 354 45
said 0 354 45
through 0 354 45
a 0 354 45
translator. 0 354 45

"The 1 354 46
world 1 354 46
will 0 354 46
see 0 354 46
a 0 354 46
major 0 354 46
change." 0 354 46

The 0 354 47
meeting 0 354 47
came 0 354 47
only 0 354 47
months 0 354 47
after 0 354 47
the 0 354 47
two 0 354 47
men 0 354 47
traded 0 354 47
nuclear 0 354 47
taunts, 0 354 47
ratcheting 0 354 47
up 0 354 47
tensions 0 354 47
and 0 354 47
leading 0 354 47
to 0 354 47
fears 0 354 47
of 0 354 47
war. 0 354 47

By 0 354 48
contrast, 0 354 48
Trump 0 354 48
appeared 0 354 48
to 0 354 48
back 0 354 48
off 0 354 48
a 0 354 48
military 0 354 48
footing 0 354 48
on 0 354 48
Tuesday, 0 354 48
declaring 0 354 48
the 0 354 48
US 0 354 48
will 0 354 48
stop 0 354 48
the 0 354 48
"war 0 354 48
games," 0 354 48
an 0 354 48
apparent 0 354 48
reference 0 354 48
to 0 354 48
joint 0 354 48
military 0 354 48
exercises 0 354 48
with 0 354 48
South 0 354 48
Korea 0 354 48
that 0 354 48
North 0 354 48
Korea 0 354 48
has 0 354 48
long 0 354 48
rebuked 0 354 48
as 0 354 48
provocative. 0 354 48

Trump 0 354 49
also 0 354 49
said 0 354 49
he 0 354 49
hopes 0 354 49
to 0 354 49
eventually 0 354 49
withdraw 0 354 49
US 0 354 49
forces 0 354 49
from 0 354 49
South 0 354 49
Korea, 0 354 49
but 0 354 49
said 0 354 49
"that's 0 354 49
not 0 354 49
part 0 354 49
of 0 354 49
the 0 354 49
equation 0 354 49
right 0 354 49
now." 0 354 49

"I 0 354 50
want 0 354 50
to 0 354 50
get 0 354 50
our 1 354 50
soldiers 1 354 50
out. 0 354 50

I 0 354 51
want 0 354 51
to 0 354 51
bring 0 354 51
our 1 354 51
soldiers 1 354 51
back 0 354 51
home," 0 354 51
Trump 0 354 51
said. 0 354 51

"But 0 354 52
that's 0 354 52
not 0 354 52
part 0 354 52
of 0 354 52
the 0 354 52
equation 0 354 52
right 0 354 52
now. 0 354 52

I 0 354 53
hope 0 354 53
it 0 354 53
will 0 354 53
be 0 354 53
eventually." 0 354 53

Tuesday's 0 354 54
meeting, 0 354 54
convened 0 354 54
at 0 354 54
a 0 354 54
luxury 0 354 54
hotel 0 354 54
on 0 354 54
the 0 354 54
island 0 354 54
of 0 354 54
Sentosa, 0 354 54
came 0 354 54
just 0 354 54
three 0 354 54
months 0 354 54
after 0 354 54
Trump 0 354 54
accepted 0 354 54
North 0 354 54
Korea's 0 354 54
invitation 0 354 54
for 0 354 54
talks 0 354 54
on 0 354 54
the 0 354 54
spot. 0 354 54

It 0 354 55
was 0 354 55
an 0 354 55
extraordinarily 0 354 55
compressed 0 354 55
timeline 0 354 55
for 0 354 55
the 0 354 55
landmark 0 354 55
summit, 0 354 55
which 0 354 55
at 0 354 55
one 0 354 55
point 0 354 55
was 0 354 55
called 0 354 55
off 0 354 55
entirely 0 354 55
as 0 354 55
communication 0 354 55
broke 0 354 55
down 0 354 55
between 0 354 55
Washington 0 354 55
and 0 354 55
Pyongyang. 0 354 55

The 0 354 56
talks 0 354 56
were 0 354 56
quickly 0 354 56
revived, 0 354 56
leading 0 354 56
to 0 354 56
the 0 354 56
highly 0 354 56
choreographed 0 354 56
event 0 354 56
that 0 354 56
unfolded 0 354 56
Tuesday. 0 354 56

After 0 354 57
the 0 354 57
men 0 354 57
shook 0 354 57
hands, 0 354 57
they 0 354 57
repaired 0 354 57
inside 0 354 57
for 0 354 57
one-on-one 0 354 57
talks. 0 354 57

In 0 354 58
that 0 354 58
first 0 354 58
meeting 0 354 58
they 0 354 58
were 0 354 58
joined 0 354 58
only 0 354 58
by 0 354 58
translators, 0 354 58
a 0 354 58
break 0 354 58
from 0 354 58
standard 0 354 58
practice 0 354 58
of 0 354 58
having 0 354 58
at 0 354 58
least 0 354 58
one 0 354 58
aide 0 354 58
present 0 354 58
for 0 354 58
high-stakes 0 354 58
huddles. 0 354 58

Later 0 354 59
in 0 354 59
the 0 354 59
day, 0 354 59
advisers 0 354 59
joined 0 354 59
the 0 354 59
talks 0 354 59
for 0 354 59
a 0 354 59
larger 0 354 59
bilateral 0 354 59
session 0 354 59
and 0 354 59
a 0 354 59
working 0 354 59
lunch. 0 354 59

Trump 0 354 60
took 0 354 60
keen 0 354 60
interest 0 354 60
in 0 354 60
the 0 354 60
pageantry 0 354 60
of 0 354 60
the 0 354 60
day, 0 354 60
insisting 0 354 60
the 0 354 60
pictures 0 354 60
beamed 0 354 60
around 0 354 60
the 0 354 60
world 0 354 60
reflect 0 354 60
a 0 354 60
commanding 1 354 60
leader 1 354 60
making 0 354 60
a 0 354 60
decisive, 0 354 60
world-altering 1 354 60
move. 0 354 60

At 0 354 61
the 0 354 61
same 0 354 61
time, 0 354 61
he'd 0 354 61
admitted 0 354 61
he 0 354 61
didn't 0 354 61
believe 0 354 61
he 0 354 61
required 0 354 61
extensive 0 354 61
preparation 0 354 61
to 0 354 61
take 0 354 61
stock 0 354 61
of 0 354 61
Kim. 0 354 61

As 0 354 62
part 0 354 62
of 0 354 62
the 0 354 62
advance 0 354 62
work, 0 354 62
Trump 0 354 62
commissioned 0 354 62
a 0 354 62
highly 0 354 62
produced 0 354 62
video 0 354 62
meant 0 354 62
to 0 354 62
convince 0 354 62
Kim 0 354 62
to 0 354 62
relinquish 0 354 62
his 0 354 62
weapons 0 354 62
and 0 354 62
open 0 354 62
his 0 354 62
country 0 354 62
to 0 354 62
outside 0 354 62
investment. 0 354 62

Trump 0 354 63
showed 0 354 63
Kim 0 354 63
the 0 354 63
movie 0 354 63
on 0 354 63
an 0 354 63
iPad 0 354 63
during 0 354 63
their 0 354 63
talks. 0 354 63

Here 0 354 64
in 0 354 64
futuristic 1 354 64
Singapore, 0 354 64
however, 0 354 64
Kim 0 354 64
was 0 354 64
able 0 354 64
to 0 354 64
view 0 354 64
the 0 354 64
benefits 0 354 64
of 0 354 64
economic 0 354 64
advancement 0 354 64
at 0 354 64
close 0 354 64
range. 0 354 64

He 0 354 65
was 0 354 65
spotted 0 354 65
taking 0 354 65
a 0 354 65
moonlit 0 354 65
stroll 0 354 65
around 0 354 65
the 0 354 65
high-end 0 354 65
Marina 0 354 65
Bay 0 354 65
Sands 0 354 65
hotel 0 354 65
and 0 354 65
casino, 0 354 65
owned 0 354 65
by 0 354 65
GOP 0 354 65
mega-donor 0 354 65
Sheldon 0 354 65
Adelson, 0 354 65
the 0 354 65
type 0 354 65
of 0 354 65
glitzy 0 354 65
development 0 354 65
few 0 354 65
North 0 354 65
Koreans 0 354 65
could 0 354 65
ever 0 354 65
imagine 0 354 65
coming 0 354 65
to 0 354 65
their 0 354 65
country. 0 354 65

Kim 0 354 66
was 0 354 66
cheered 0 354 66
by 0 354 66
onlookers 0 354 66
who 0 354 66
caught 0 354 66
sight 0 354 66
of 0 354 66
the 0 354 66
dictator, 1 354 66
who 0 354 66
until 0 354 66
earlier 0 354 66
this 0 354 66
spring 0 354 66
was 0 354 66
not 0 354 66
believed 0 354 66
to 0 354 66
have 0 354 66
ever 0 354 66
left 0 354 66
North 0 354 66
Korea 0 354 66
as 0 354 66
supreme 0 354 66
leader. 0 354 66

Newt 0 356 0
Gingrich: 0 356 0
The 0 356 0
truth 0 356 0
about 0 356 0
Trump, 0 356 0
Putin, 0 356 0
and 0 356 0
Obama 0 356 0

President 0 356 1
Trump’s 0 356 1
summit 0 356 1
Monday 0 356 1
with 0 356 1
Russian 0 356 1
President 0 356 1
Vladimir 0 356 1
Putin 0 356 1
in 0 356 1
Helsinki 0 356 1
created 0 356 1
a 0 356 1
firestorm 1 356 1
of 0 356 1
controversy. 0 356 1

President 0 356 2
Trump 0 356 2
seemed 0 356 2
to 0 356 2
be 0 356 2
publicly 0 356 2
siding 0 356 2
with 0 356 2
the 0 356 2
Russian 1 356 2
dictator 1 356 2
against 0 356 2
the 0 356 2
American 0 356 2
intelligence 0 356 2
agencies. 0 356 2

The 0 356 3
initial 0 356 3
appearance 0 356 3
was 0 356 3
so 0 356 3
bad 1 356 3
that 0 356 3
I 0 356 3
tweeted: 0 356 3
“President 0 356 3
Trump 0 356 3
must 0 356 3
clarify 0 356 3
his 0 356 3
statements 0 356 3
in 0 356 3
Helsinki 0 356 3
on 0 356 3
our 0 356 3
intelligence 0 356 3
system 0 356 3
and 0 356 3
Putin. 0 356 3

It 0 356 4
is 0 356 4
the 1 356 4
most 1 356 4
serious 1 356 4
mistake 0 356 4
of 0 356 4
his 0 356 4
presidency 0 356 4
and 0 356 4
must 0 356 4
be 0 356 4
corrected 0 356 4
– 0 356 4
immediately.” 0 356 4

After 0 356 5
flying 0 356 5
home 0 356 5
from 0 356 5
Helsinki 0 356 5
and 0 356 5
reviewing 0 356 5
the 0 356 5
tape 0 356 5
and 0 356 5
transcript 0 356 5
of 0 356 5
his 0 356 5
press 0 356 5
conference 0 356 5
with 0 356 5
Putin, 0 356 5
President 0 356 5
Trump 0 356 5
said 0 356 5
he 0 356 5
has 0 356 5
“full 0 356 5
faith 0 356 5
and 0 356 5
support 0 356 5
for 0 356 5
America’s 1 356 5
great 1 356 5
intelligence 1 356 5
agencies” 1 356 5
and 0 356 5
that 0 356 5
he 0 356 5
accepts 0 356 5
“our 0 356 5
intelligence 0 356 5
community’s 0 356 5
conclusion 0 356 5
that 0 356 5
Russia’s 0 356 5
meddling 0 356 5
in 0 356 5
the 0 356 5
2016 0 356 5
election 0 356 5
took 0 356 5
place.” 0 356 5

In 0 356 6
his 0 356 6
remarks 0 356 6
to 0 356 6
members 0 356 6
of 0 356 6
Congress 0 356 6
Tuesday 0 356 6
that 0 356 6
were 0 356 6
televised 0 356 6
by 0 356 6
the 0 356 6
media, 0 356 6
President 0 356 6
Trump 0 356 6
went 0 356 6
on 0 356 6
to 0 356 6
admit 0 356 6
that 0 356 6
he 0 356 6
realized 0 356 6
he 0 356 6
needed 0 356 6
to 0 356 6
clarify 0 356 6
his 0 356 6
statements 0 356 6
in 0 356 6
Helsinki. 0 356 6

The 0 356 7
president 0 356 7
said: 0 356 7
“It 0 356 7
should 0 356 7
have 0 356 7
been 0 356 7
obvious 0 356 7
– 0 356 7
I 0 356 7
thought 0 356 7
it 0 356 7
would 0 356 7
be 0 356 7
obvious 0 356 7
– 0 356 7
but 0 356 7
I 0 356 7
would 0 356 7
like 0 356 7
to 0 356 7
clarify, 0 356 7
just 0 356 7
in 0 356 7
case 0 356 7
it 0 356 7
wasn’t. 0 356 7

In 0 356 8
a 0 356 8
key 0 356 8
sentence 0 356 8
in 0 356 8
my 0 356 8
remarks, 0 356 8
I 0 356 8
said 0 356 8
the 0 356 8
word 0 356 8
‘would’ 0 356 8
instead 0 356 8
of 0 356 8
“wouldn’t.” 0 356 8
The 0 356 8
sentence 0 356 8
should 0 356 8
have 0 356 8
been: 0 356 8
I 0 356 8
don’t 0 356 8
see 0 356 8
any 0 356 8
reason 0 356 8
why 0 356 8
I 0 356 8
wouldn’t 0 356 8
– 0 356 8
or 0 356 8
why 0 356 8
it 0 356 8
wouldn’t 0 356 8
be 0 356 8
Russia. 0 356 8

So 0 356 9
just 0 356 9
to 0 356 9
repeat 0 356 9
it, 0 356 9
I 0 356 9

“I 0 356 10
have, 0 356 10
on 0 356 10
numerous 0 356 10
occasions, 0 356 10
noted 0 356 10
our 0 356 10
intelligence 0 356 10
findings 0 356 10
that 0 356 10
Russians 0 356 10
attempted 0 356 10
to 0 356 10
interfere 0 356 10
in 0 356 10
our 1 356 10
elections. 0 356 10

Unlike 0 356 11
previous 0 356 11
administrations, 0 356 11
my 0 356 11
administration 0 356 11
has 0 356 11
and 0 356 11
will 0 356 11
continue 0 356 11

efforts 0 356 11
– 0 356 11
and 0 356 11
repel 0 356 11
– 0 356 11
we 0 356 11
will 0 356 11
stop 0 356 11
it, 0 356 11
we 0 356 11
will 0 356 11

We’re 0 356 12

everything 0 356 12
in 0 356 12
our 1 356 12
power 0 356 12

2018.” 0 356 12

Anyone 0 356 13
who 0 356 13
has 0 356 13
studied 0 356 13
President 0 356 13
Trump 0 356 13
knows 0 356 13
he 0 356 13
hates 0 356 13
to 0 356 13
admit 0 356 13
a 0 356 13
mistake. 0 356 13

His 0 356 14
natural 0 356 14
pattern 0 356 14
is 0 356 14
to 0 356 14
move 0 356 14
forward 0 356 14
and 0 356 14
ignore 0 356 14
mistakes. 0 356 14

For 0 356 15
him, 0 356 15
this 0 356 15
was 0 356 15
a 0 356 15
big 0 356 15
correction 0 356 15
(and 0 356 15
as 0 356 15
I 0 356 15
noted 0 356 15
the 0 356 15
day 0 356 15
before, 0 356 15
it 0 356 15
was 0 356 15
an 0 356 15
absolutely 0 356 15
necessary 0 356 15
one). 0 356 15

President 1 356 16
Trump 1 356 16
then 1 356 16
reminded 1 356 16
everyone 1 356 16
of 1 356 16
the 1 356 16
Obama 1 356 16
administration’s 1 356 16
failures 1 356 16
in 1 356 16

Russian 1 356 16
meddling 1 356 16
in 1 356 16
the 1 356 16
election. 1 356 16

President 0 356 17
Trump 0 356 17
noted 0 356 17
that 0 356 17
President 0 356 17
Obama 0 356 17
and 0 356 17
his 0 356 17
advisers 0 356 17
had 0 356 17
information 0 356 17
that 0 356 17
the 0 356 17
Russians 0 356 17
had 0 356 17
been 0 356 17
working 0 356 17
to 0 356 17
interfere 0 356 17
in 0 356 17
the 0 356 17
election 0 356 17
and 0 356 17
they 0 356 17
ignored 0 356 17
it, 0 356 17
because 1 356 17
they 1 356 17
thought 1 356 17
Hillary 1 356 17
Clinton 1 356 17
was 1 356 17
going 1 356 17
to 1 356 17
win. 1 356 17

President 0 356 18
Trump 0 356 18
said: 0 356 18
“President 0 356 18
Obama, 0 356 18

with 0 356 18

the 0 356 18
whole 0 356 18

that 0 356 18
you 0 356 18
see 0 356 18
on 0 356 18
television 0 356 18
now 0 356 18
– 0 356 18
probably 0 356 18
getting 0 356 18
paid 0 356 18
a 0 356 18
lot 0 356 18
of 0 356 18
money 0 356 18
by 0 356 18
your 0 356 18
networks 0 356 18
– 0 356 18
they 0 356 18
knew 0 356 18
about 0 356 18
Russia’s 0 356 18
attempt 0 356 18
to 0 356 18
interfere 0 356 18
in 0 356 18
the 0 356 18
election 0 356 18
in 0 356 18
September, 0 356 18
and 0 356 18
they 0 356 18
totally 0 356 18
buried 0 356 18
it. 0 356 18

And 0 356 19
as 0 356 19
I 0 356 19
said, 0 356 19
they 0 356 19
buried 0 356 19
it 0 356 19
because 1 356 19
they 1 356 19
thought 1 356 19
that 1 356 19

was 1 356 19
going 1 356 19

It 0 356 20
turned 0 356 20
out 0 356 20
it 0 356 20
didn’t 0 356 20
happen 0 356 20
that 0 356 20
way. 0 356 20

“By 0 356 21
contrast, 0 356 21
my 0 356 21
administration 0 356 21
has 0 356 21
taken 0 356 21
a 0 356 21
very 0 356 21
firm 0 356 21
stance 0 356 21
– 0 356 21
it’s 1 356 21
a 1 356 21
very 1 356 21
firm 1 356 21
stance 1 356 21
– 0 356 21
on 0 356 21
a 0 356 21
strong 0 356 21
action. 0 356 21

We’re 0 356 22
going 0 356 22
to 0 356 22
take 0 356 22
strong 1 356 22
action 1 356 22
to 0 356 22
secure 0 356 22
our 0 356 22
election 0 356 22
systems 0 356 22
and 0 356 22
the 0 356 22
process.” 0 356 22

There 0 356 23
are 0 356 23
two 0 356 23
key 0 356 23
facts 0 356 23
in 0 356 23
this 0 356 23
statement. 0 356 23

First, 0 356 24
the 0 356 24
very 0 356 24
people 0 356 24
who 0 356 24
have 0 356 24
been 0 356 24
loudest 1 356 24
in 0 356 24
attacking 0 356 24
President 0 356 24
Trump 0 356 24
about 0 356 24
his 0 356 24
performance 0 356 24
at 0 356 24
the 0 356 24
Helsinki 0 356 24
summit 0 356 24
are 0 356 24
the 0 356 24
people 0 356 24
who 0 356 24
failed 0 356 24
to 0 356 24
protect 0 356 24
America 0 356 24
from 0 356 24
Russian 0 356 24
meddling 0 356 24
in 0 356 24
2016. 0 356 24

The 1 356 25
very 1 356 25
intensity 0 356 25
and 0 356 25
nastiness 1 356 25
of 0 356 25
former 0 356 25
CIA 0 356 25
Director 0 356 25
Brennan 0 356 25
and 0 356 25
former 0 356 25
Director 0 356 25
of 0 356 25
National 0 356 25
Intelligence 0 356 25
Clapper 0 356 25
is 0 356 25
an 0 356 25
attempt 0 356 25
to 0 356 25
distract 0 356 25
attention 0 356 25
from 0 356 25
their 0 356 25
failure 0 356 25
to 1 356 25
protect 1 356 25
America. 1 356 25

It 0 356 26
was 0 356 26
their 0 356 26
duty 0 356 26
in 0 356 26
2016 0 356 26
– 0 356 26
not 0 356 26
candidate 0 356 26
Trump’s. 0 356 26

Second, 0 356 27
the 0 356 27
Trump 0 356 27
administration 0 356 27
has 0 356 27
been 0 356 27
far 0 356 27
tougher 0 356 27
on 0 356 27
Russia 0 356 27
than 0 356 27
President 0 356 27
Obama 0 356 27
ever 0 356 27
dreamed 0 356 27
of 0 356 27
being. 0 356 27

The 1 356 28
Trump 1 356 28
administration 1 356 28
is 0 356 28
taking 0 356 28
real 0 356 28
actions 0 356 28
designed 0 356 28
to 0 356 28
weaken 0 356 28
Russia 0 356 28
and 0 356 28
force 0 356 28
Putin 0 356 28
to 0 356 28
change 0 356 28
his 0 356 28
aggressive 1 356 28
behavior. 0 356 28

The 1 356 29
Trump 1 356 29
administration 1 356 29
has 0 356 29
levied 0 356 29
tough 0 356 29
sanctions 0 356 29
on 0 356 29
Russia. 0 356 29

Also, 0 356 30
President 0 356 30
Trump’s 0 356 30
public 0 356 30
lecture 0 356 30
about 0 356 30
Germany 0 356 30
not 0 356 30
buying 0 356 30
natural 0 356 30
gas 0 356 30
from 0 356 30
Russia 0 356 30
was 0 356 30
aimed 0 356 30
at 0 356 30
cutting 0 356 30
Putin 0 356 30
off 0 356 30
from 0 356 30
hard 0 356 30
currency 0 356 30
worth 0 356 30
tens 0 356 30
of 0 356 30
billions 0 356 30
of 0 356 30
dollars 0 356 30
and 0 356 30
further 0 356 30
weakening 0 356 30
the 0 356 30
Russian 0 356 30
economy. 0 356 30

Furthermore, 0 356 31
President 0 356 31
Trump’s 0 356 31
efforts 0 356 31
to 0 356 31
get 0 356 31
our 0 356 31
European 0 356 31
allies 0 356 31
to 0 356 31
increase 0 356 31
their 0 356 31
defense 0 356 31
spending 0 356 31
has 0 356 31
a 0 356 31
direct 0 356 31
impact 0 356 31
on 0 356 31
Putin. 0 356 31

The 1 356 32
stronger 1 356 32
NATO 1 356 32
is, 1 356 32
the 1 356 32
less 1 356 32
maneuvering 1 356 32
room 1 356 32
Russia 1 356 32
has. 1 356 32

Beyond 0 356 33
pressuring 0 356 33
our 1 356 33
allies, 0 356 33
consider 0 356 33
these 0 356 33
specific 0 356 33
steps 0 356 33
President 0 356 33
Trump 0 356 33
has 0 356 33
taken 0 356 33
against 0 356 33
Russia: 0 356 33

Where 0 356 34
President 0 356 34
Obama 0 356 34
refused 0 356 34
to 0 356 34
provide 0 356 34
serious 0 356 34
weapons 0 356 34
to 0 356 34
the 0 356 34
Ukrainians 0 356 34
to 0 356 34
help 0 356 34
them 0 356 34
defend 0 356 34
themselves 0 356 34
(his 0 356 34
response 0 356 34
was 0 356 34
weakness 1 356 34
on 1 356 34
a 1 356 34
pathetic 1 356 34
scale), 1 356 34
President 0 356 34
Trump 0 356 34
has 0 356 34
approved 0 356 34
the 0 356 34
sale 0 356 34
of 0 356 34
offensive 0 356 34
weapons 0 356 34
to 0 356 34
enable 0 356 34
the 0 356 34
Ukrainians 0 356 34
to 0 356 34
increase 0 356 34
the 0 356 34
cost 0 356 34
of 0 356 34
Russian 0 356 34
aggression. 0 356 34

When 0 356 35
the 0 356 35
Russians 0 356 35
used 0 356 35
chemical 0 356 35
weapons 0 356 35
in 0 356 35
Great 0 356 35
Britain, 0 356 35
President 0 356 35
Trump 0 356 35
joined 0 356 35
our 1 356 35
allies 0 356 35
and 0 356 35
expelled 0 356 35
60 0 356 35
Russian 0 356 35
intelligence 0 356 35
officers 0 356 35
from 0 356 35
the 0 356 35
United 0 356 35
States. 0 356 35

When 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
Russians 0 356 36
retaliated, 0 356 36
the 1 356 36
Trump 1 356 36
administration 1 356 36
closed 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
Russian 0 356 36
consulate 0 356 36
in 0 356 36
Seattle. 0 356 36

President 0 356 37
Trump 0 356 37
had 0 356 37
previously 0 356 37
shuttered 0 356 37
the 0 356 37
Russian 0 356 37
consulate 0 356 37
in 0 356 37
San 0 356 37
Francisco 0 356 37
and 0 356 37
smaller 0 356 37
annexes 0 356 37
in 0 356 37
Washington 0 356 37
and 0 356 37
New 0 356 37
York. 0 356 37

More 0 356 38
than 0 356 38
100 0 356 38
Russian 0 356 38
individuals 0 356 38
and 0 356 38
companies 0 356 38
have 0 356 38
been 0 356 38
sanctioned 0 356 38
for 0 356 38
a 0 356 38
variety 0 356 38
of 0 356 38
reasons. 0 356 38

Despite 0 356 39
the 0 356 39
hysteria 0 356 39
of 0 356 39
the 0 356 39
left, 0 356 39
it 0 356 39
is 0 356 39
impossible 0 356 39
to 0 356 39
see 0 356 39
the 1 356 39
Trump 1 356 39
administration 1 356 39
as 0 356 39
anything 0 356 39
but 0 356 39
firm 1 356 39
in 0 356 39
its 0 356 39
dealing 0 356 39
with 0 356 39
Russia. 0 356 39

Nothing 0 356 40
done 0 356 40
in 0 356 40
Helsinki 0 356 40
made 0 356 40
life 0 356 40
easier 0 356 40
for 0 356 40
the 0 356 40
Putin 0 356 40
regime 0 356 40
in 0 356 40
its 0 356 40
continued 0 356 40
economic 0 356 40
decay 0 356 40
and 0 356 40
diplomatic 0 356 40
isolation 0 356 40
due 0 356 40
to 0 356 40
the 0 356 40
sanctions 0 356 40
regime. 0 356 40

Finally, 0 356 41
a 0 356 41
brief 0 356 41
word 0 356 41
about 0 356 41
the 0 356 41
strong 0 356 41
language 0 356 41
and 0 356 41
vicious 1 356 41
comments 0 356 41
about 0 356 41
the 0 356 41
president. 0 356 41

We 0 356 42
are 0 356 42
in 0 356 42
the 0 356 42
early 0 356 42
stages 0 356 42

With 0 356 44
President 0 356 44
Trump’s 0 356 44
nomination 0 356 44
of 0 356 44
Judge 0 356 44
Brett 0 356 44
Kavanaugh 0 356 44
to 0 356 44
the 0 356 44
Supreme 0 356 44
Court, 0 356 44
it 0 356 44
was 0 356 44
clear 0 356 44
that 0 356 44
anyone 0 356 44
Trump 0 356 44
nominated 0 356 44
was 0 356 44
going 0 356 44
to 0 356 44
be 0 356 44
attacked. 0 356 44

In 0 356 45
fact, 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
demonstrators 0 356 45
protesting 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
nomination 0 356 45
had 0 356 45
signs 0 356 45
for 0 356 45
all 0 356 45
four 0 356 45
of 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
finalists 0 356 45
and 0 356 45
were 0 356 45
instantly 0 356 45
ready 0 356 45
to 0 356 45
oppose 0 356 45
the 0 356 45
president 0 356 45
regardless 0 356 45
of 0 356 45
his 0 356 45
choice. 0 356 45

Similarly, 0 356 46
Obama-era 0 356 46
national 0 356 46
security 0 356 46
officials 0 356 46
seem 0 356 46
determined 0 356 46
to 0 356 46
use 0 356 46
the 0 356 46
harshest 1 356 46
possible 1 356 46
language 0 356 46
to 0 356 46
attack 0 356 46
President 0 356 46
Trump. 0 356 46

I 0 356 47
think 0 356 47
their 0 356 47
strong 0 356 47
words 0 356 47
and 0 356 47
hysteria 1 356 47
are 0 356 47
driven 1 356 47
by 1 356 47
their 1 356 47
own 1 356 47
guilt. 1 356 47

Whatever 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
Russians 0 356 48
did, 0 356 48
they 0 356 48
did 0 356 48
while 0 356 48
Brennan 0 356 48
was 0 356 48
director 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
CIA, 0 356 48
Clapper 0 356 48
was 0 356 48
director 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
national 0 356 48
intelligence, 0 356 48
and 0 356 48
James 0 356 48
Comey 0 356 48
was 0 356 48
head 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
Federal 0 356 48
Bureau 0 356 48
of 0 356 48
Investigation. 0 356 48

These 0 356 49
former 0 356 49
officials 0 356 49
attack 0 356 49
Trump 0 356 49
ferociously 1 356 49
to 0 356 49
hide 0 356 49
their 0 356 49
own 0 356 49
failure 0 356 49
and 0 356 49
their 0 356 49
own 0 356 49

Just 0 356 50
keep 0 356 50
that 0 356 50
in 0 356 50

the 0 356 50

My 0 356 51
prediction 0 356 51
is 0 356 51
that 0 356 51
President 0 356 51

will 0 356 51
remain 0 356 51

and 0 356 51
the 0 356 51
Helsinki 0 356 51

will 0 356 51
be 0 356 51

of 0 357 6
the 0 357 6

December 0 357 7
2007, 0 357 7
3200 0 357 7
Phaethon 0 357 7
is 0 357 7
widely 0 357 7
thought 0 357 7
to 0 357 7
be 0 357 7
the 0 357 7
parent 0 357 7
body 0 357 7
for 0 357 7
the 0 357 7

which 0 357 7

due 0 357 7
to 0 357 7
peak 0 357 7
this 0 357 7
year 0 357 7

the 0 357 7
night 0 357 7
of 0 357 7
December 0 357 7

This 0 357 8
would 0 357 8
make 0 357 8
the 0 357 8
Geminids 0 357 8
one 0 357 8

The 0 357 9
main 0 357 9
difference 0 357 9
between 0 357 9
asteroids 0 357 9
and 0 357 9
comets 0 357 9
is 0 357 9
their 0 357 9
composition. 0 357 9

Asteroids 0 357 10
are 0 357 10
made 0 357 10
up 0 357 10
of 0 357 10
metals 0 357 10
and 0 357 10
rocky 0 357 10
material, 0 357 10
while 0 357 10
comets 0 357 10
are 0 357 10
made 0 357 10
up 0 357 10
of 0 357 10
ice, 0 357 10
dust 0 357 10
and 0 357 10
rocky 0 357 10
material. 0 357 10

Comets 0 357 11
which 0 357 11
approach 0 357 11
the 0 357 11
Sun 0 357 11
lose 0 357 11
material 0 357 11
with 0 357 11
each 0 357 11
orbit 0 357 11
because 0 357 11
some 0 357 11
of 0 357 11
their 0 357 11
ice 0 357 11
melts 0 357 11
and 0 357 11
vaporizes 0 357 11
to 0 357 11
form 0 357 11
a 0 357 11
tail. 0 357 11

But 0 357 12
the 0 357 12
real 0 357 12
question 0 357 12
is 0 357 12
will 0 357 12
anyone 0 357 12
be 0 357 12
able 0 357 12
to 0 357 12
see 0 357 12
the 0 357 12
asteroid’s 0 357 12
close 0 357 12
approach 0 357 12
to 0 357 12
our 0 357 12
planet. 0 357 12

According 0 357 13
to 0 357 13
NASA, 0 357 13
3200 0 357 13
Phaethon 0 357 13
will 0 357 13
be 0 357 13
visible 0 357 13
in 0 357 13
small 0 357 13
telescopes 0 357 13
for 0 357 13
experienced 0 357 13
observers 0 357 13
in 0 357 13
areas 0 357 13
with 0 357 13
dark 0 357 13
skies. 0 357 13

It 0 357 14
is 0 357 14
potentially 0 357 14
detectable 0 357 14
for 0 357 14
three 0 357 14
weeks 0 357 14
but 0 357 14
will 0 357 14
be 0 357 14
at 0 357 14
its 0 357 14
brightest 0 357 14
between 0 357 14
December 0 357 14
11 0 357 14
and 0 357 14
21. 0 357 14

If 0 357 15
you 0 357 15
don’t 0 357 15

too 0 358 4

paid 0 358 7
almost 0 358 7
$1,000, 0 358 7
students 0 358 7
were 0 358 7
required 0 358 7
to 0 358 7
complete 0 358 7
a 0 358 7
project 0 358 7
outline 0 358 7
last 0 358 7
month 0 358 7
in 0 358 7
which 0 358 7
they 0 358 7
would 0 358 7
compare 0 358 7
a 0 358 7
social 0 358 7
norm 0 358 7
in 0 358 7
the 0 358 7
US 0 358 7
and 0 358 7
another 0 358 7
country. 0 358 7

For 0 358 8
her 0 358 8
"norm" 0 358 8
Arnold 0 358 8
picked 0 358 8
social 0 358 8
media 0 358 8
use, 0 358 8
and 0 358 8
for 0 358 8
her 0 358 8
country 0 358 8
she 0 358 8
chose 0 358 8
Australia. 0 358 8

But 0 358 9
when 0 358 9
Arnold 0 358 9
got 0 358 9
her 0 358 9
grade 0 358 9
back 0 358 9
on 0 358 9
Feb. 0 358 9
1, 0 358 9
she 0 358 9
was 0 358 9
shocked 1 358 9
to 0 358 9
see 0 358 9
her 0 358 9
professor 0 358 9
had 0 358 9
failed 0 358 9
her. 0 358 9

Why? 0 358 10

Because, 0 358 11
according 0 358 11
to 0 358 11
the 0 358 11
teacher, 0 358 11
"Australia 0 358 11
is 0 358 11
a 0 358 11
continent; 0 358 11
not 0 358 11
a 0 358 11
country." 0 358 11

Sociology. 1 358 12

You 1 358 13
really 1 358 13
don't 1 358 13
need 1 358 13
to 1 358 13
know 1 358 13
anything. 1 358 13

The 1 358 14
professor, 1 358 14
who 1 358 14
has 1 358 14
a 1 358 14
PhD 1 358 14
in 1 358 14
philosophy... 1 358 14

Of 1 358 15
course 1 358 15
she 1 358 15
does. 1 358 15

I 0 358 16
believe 0 358 16
I 0 358 16
got 0 358 16
zero 0 358 16
or 0 358 16
partial 0 358 16
credit 0 358 16
because 0 358 16
the 0 358 16
instructor 0 358 16
said, 0 358 16
'Australia 0 358 16
is 0 358 16
a 0 358 16
continent; 0 358 16
not 0 358 16
a 0 358 16
country. 0 358 16

However, 0 358 17
I 0 358 17
believe 0 358 17
that 0 358 17
Australia 0 358 17
is 0 358 17
a 0 358 17
country. 0 358 17

The 0 358 18
research 0 358 18
starter 0 358 18
on 0 358 18
the 0 358 18
SNHU’s 0 358 18
Shapiro 0 358 18
library 0 358 18
written 0 358 18
by 0 358 18
John 0 358 18
Pearson 0 358 18
(2013) 0 358 18
states, 0 358 18
that 0 358 18
Australia 0 358 18
is 0 358 18
the 0 358 18
'sixth-largest 0 358 18
country 0 358 18
in 0 358 18
the 0 358 18
world' 0 358 18
(n.p.). 0 358 18

The 0 358 19
full 0 358 19
name 0 358 19
of 0 358 19
the 0 358 19
country 0 358 19
is 0 358 19
the 0 358 19
Commonwealth 0 358 19
of 0 358 19
Australia, 0 358 19
meaning 0 358 19
Australia 0 358 19
is 0 358 19
both 0 358 19
a 0 358 19
continent 0 358 19
and 0 358 19
a 0 358 19
country. 0 358 19

Therefore, 0 358 20
these 0 358 20
sections 0 358 20
of 0 358 20
the 0 358 20
rubric 0 358 20
should 0 358 20
be 0 358 20
amended. 0 358 20

Australia's 0 358 21
nationhood 0 358 21
is 0 358 21
not 0 358 21
a 0 358 21
matter 0 358 21
of 0 358 21
belief. 0 358 21

But 0 358 22
we 0 358 22
are 0 358 22
in 0 358 22
the 1 358 22
age 1 358 22
of, 1 358 22
"My 1 358 22
truth". 1 358 22

And 0 358 23
my 1 358 23
truth 1 358 23
has 0 358 23
a 0 358 23
different 0 358 23
belief 0 358 23
about 0 358 23
Australia 0 358 23
than 0 358 23
yours 0 358 23
does 0 358 23
because 0 358 23
of 0 358 23
my 0 358 23
degree 0 358 23
of 0 358 23
oppression. 0 358 23

Finally, 0 358 24

the 0 358 25
professor 0 358 25
responded: 0 358 25
Thank 0 358 25
you 0 358 25
for 0 358 25
this 0 358 25
web-address 0 358 25

After 0 358 26
I 0 358 26
do 0 358 26
some 0 358 26
independent 0 358 26
research 0 358 26
on 0 358 26
the 0 358 26
continent/country 0 358 26
issue 0 358 26
I 0 358 26
will 0 358 26
review 0 358 26
your 0 358 26
paper. 0 358 26

Who 0 358 27
can 0 358 27
really 0 358 27
say? 0 358 27

‘Hola’ 1 360 0

They 0 360 2
won’t 0 360 2
be 0 360 2
doing 0 360 2
any 0 360 2
of 0 360 2
that 0 360 2
now. 0 360 2

In 0 360 3

It’s 0 360 3

now. 0 360 3

We 0 360 4
won’t 0 360 4
be 0 360 4
seeing 0 360 4
anything 0 360 4
near 0 360 4
the 0 360 4
same 0 360 4

Not 0 360 5

they’ve 0 360 5

of 0 360 11
that 0 360 11
razor 0 360 11

going 0 360 11

Here’s 0 360 12
what 0 360 12
the 0 360 12
military 0 360 12
was 0 360 12
REALLY 0 360 12
up 0 360 12
to, 0 360 12
when 0 360 12
CNN 0 360 12
and 0 360 12
the 0 360 12
rest 0 360 12
had 0 360 12
their 0 360 12

dreams 0 360 12
about 0 360 12

If 0 360 13

on 0 360 13
dragging 0 360 13
its 0 360 13

of 0 360 13
a 0 360 13

Trump 0 360 13

as 0 360 13
he 0 360 13
had 0 360 13
promised 0 360 13
to 0 360 13
do. 0 360 13

Like 0 360 14
Razorwire. 0 360 14

The 0 360 15
Trumpinator: 0 360 15
every 0 360 15
time 0 360 15
his 0 360 15
rivals 0 360 15
think 0 360 15
they’ve 0 360 15
got 0 360 15
him 0 360 15
down 0 360 15
and 0 360 15
out, 0 360 15
he 0 360 15
stands 0 360 15
back 0 360 15
up 0 360 15
and 0 360 15
keeps 0 360 15
on 0 360 15
coming. 0 360 15

They 0 360 16
laughed 0 360 16
when 0 360 16
he 0 360 16
announced 0 360 16
his 0 360 16
candidacy. 0 360 16

They 0 360 17
thought 0 360 17
he 0 360 17
was 0 360 17
just 0 360 17
some 0 360 17
kind 0 360 17
of 0 360 17
a 0 360 17
circus 0 360 17
sideshow 0 360 17

They 1 360 18
couldn’t 1 360 18
have 1 360 18
been 1 360 18
more 1 360 18
wrong. 1 360 18

He 0 360 19
survived 0 360 19
the 0 360 19
primaries 0 360 19
and 0 360 19
got 0 360 19
the 0 360 19

He 0 360 20
knocked 1 360 20
out 1 360 20
Crooked 0 360 20
Hillary. 0 360 20

He 0 360 21
beat 0 360 21
CNN 0 360 21
at 0 360 21
their 0 360 21
own 0 360 21
game, 0 360 21
and 0 360 21
their 0 360 21
ratings 0 360 21
are 0 360 21
now 0 360 21
circling 0 360 21
the 0 360 21
toilet. 0 360 21

Mueller 0 360 22
and 0 360 22
the 0 360 22
Dossier 0 360 22
aren’t 0 360 22
just 0 360 22
coming 0 360 22
up 0 360 22
empty, 0 360 22
they’re 0 360 22
exposing 0 360 22

and 0 360 22
all 0 360 22
the 0 360 22
rest. 0 360 22

And 0 360 23
Trump 0 360 23
is 0 360 23
still 0 360 23
keeping 0 360 23
promises, 0 360 23
and 0 360 23
getting 0 360 23
things 0 360 23
done. 0 360 23

The 0 360 24
economy 0 360 24
is 0 360 24
doing 0 360 24
exactly 0 360 24
what 0 360 24

it 0 360 24
would. 0 360 24

in 0 360 26

The 0 360 26

The 0 361 7
ratification 0 361 7

is 0 361 7
typically 0 361 7
a 0 361 7
mere 0 361 7
formality, 0 361 7
but 0 361 7
Monday’s 0 361 7

Democratize 0 361 8
SSMU 0 361 8
was 0 361 8
able 0 361 8
to 0 361 8
pass 0 361 8
a 0 361 8
motion 0 361 8
that 0 361 8
required 0 361 8
each 0 361 8
board 0 361 8

to 0 361 8
be 0 361 8

separately 0 361 8
under 0 361 8
the 0 361 8

that 0 361 8
they 0 361 8
weren’t 0 361 8
a 0 361 8
fan 0 361 8
of 0 361 8

When 0 361 9
it 0 361 9
was 0 361 9
Lew’s 0 361 9
turn, 0 361 9
he 0 361 9
was 0 361 9

down. 0 361 10

Democratize 0 361 11
SSMU 0 361 11
had 0 361 11
targeted 0 361 11
Lew 0 361 11
and 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
other 0 361 11
two 0 361 11
students 0 361 11
on 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
board 0 361 11
because 0 361 11
they 0 361 11
had 0 361 11
connections 0 361 11
to 0 361 11
the 0 361 11

Affairs 0 361 11
Committee 0 361 11
(CJPAC) 0 361 11
and 0 361 11
were 0 361 11
involved 0 361 11
in 0 361 11
getting 0 361 11
the 0 361 11
BDS 0 361 11
ban 0 361 11
passed, 0 361 11
which 0 361 11
Democratize 0 361 11
SSMU 0 361 11
claimed 0 361 11
were 0 361 11
“conflicts 0 361 11
of 0 361 11
interests.” 0 361 11

Somehow 0 361 12
I 0 361 12
don't 0 361 12
think 0 361 12
being 0 361 12
a 0 361 12
member 0 361 12
of 0 361 12
a 0 361 12
Muslim 0 361 12
student 0 361 12
group 0 361 12
and 0 361 12
supporting 0 361 12
BDS 0 361 12
would 0 361 12
be 0 361 12
considered 0 361 12
a 0 361 12
conflict 0 361 12
of 0 361 12
interest. 0 361 12

But 0 361 13
the 1 361 13
campus 1 361 13
anti-Israel 1 361 13
crowd 1 361 13
has 0 361 13
been 0 361 13
working 0 361 13
rather 0 361 13
hard 0 361 13
to 0 361 13
intimidate 0 361 13
and 0 361 13
penalize 0 361 13
anyone 0 361 13
involved 0 361 13
in 0 361 13
pro-Israel 0 361 13
organizations. 0 361 13

And 0 361 14
to 0 361 14
keep 0 361 14
their 0 361 14
racist 1 361 14
boycott 1 361 14

Lew 0 361 17

that 0 361 17
the 0 361 17

On 0 361 21
Monday 0 361 21
night, 0 361 21
three 0 361 21
students 0 361 21
were 0 361 21
removed 0 361 21
from 0 361 21
the 0 361 21
Board 0 361 21
of 0 361 21
Directors 0 361 21

McGill 0 361 21

McGill’s 0 361 21
main 0 361 21
student 0 361 21

All 0 361 22
three 0 361 22
were 0 361 22
targeted 0 361 22
for 0 361 22
removal 0 361 22
either 0 361 22
because 0 361 22
they 0 361 22
are 0 361 22
Jewish 0 361 22
or 0 361 22
have 0 361 22
vocally 0 361 22
opposed 0 361 22
anti-Jewish 0 361 22
discrimination 0 361 22
on 0 361 22
campus. 0 361 22

This 0 361 23
episode 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
utterly 1 361 23
unacceptable, 1 361 23
and 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
merely 0 361 23
the 0 361 23
latest 0 361 23
in 0 361 23
a 0 361 23
long 0 361 23
string 0 361 23
of 0 361 23
antisemitic 0 361 23
incidents 0 361 23
at 0 361 23
your 0 361 23
university. 0 361 23

Indeed, 0 361 24
according 0 361 24
to 0 361 24
eyewitnesses, 0 361 24
one 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
members 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
mob 0 361 24
that 0 361 24
removed 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
three 0 361 24
directors 0 361 24
was 0 361 24
Igor 0 361 24
Sadikov. 0 361 24

You 0 361 25
will 0 361 25
remember 0 361 25
Sadikov 0 361 25
as 0 361 25
the 0 361 25
student 0 361 25
politician 0 361 25
who 0 361 25
in 0 361 25
February 0 361 25
told 0 361 25
his 0 361 25
followers 0 361 25
to 0 361 25
“punch 1 361 25
a 1 361 25
Zionist 1 361 25
today.” 1 361 25
It 0 361 25
is 0 361 25
unclear 0 361 25
whether 0 361 25
Sadikov 0 361 25
has 0 361 25
faced 0 361 25
any 0 361 25
disciplinary 0 361 25
action 0 361 25
for 0 361 25
this 0 361 25
incitement 0 361 25
to 0 361 25
violence 0 361 25
from 0 361 25
your 0 361 25
administration. 0 361 25

Antisemitism 0 361 26
at 0 361 26
McGill 0 361 26
does 0 361 26
not 0 361 26
emerge 0 361 26
from 0 361 26
a 0 361 26
vacuum. 0 361 26

Rather, 0 361 27
it 0 361 27
has 0 361 27
been 0 361 27
nurtured 0 361 27
in 0 361 27
part 0 361 27
by 0 361 27
a 1 361 27
toxic 1 361 27
campus 1 361 27
press, 1 361 27
especially 0 361 27
the 0 361 27
McGill 0 361 27
Daily, 0 361 27
a 0 361 27
publication 0 361 27
which 0 361 27
openly 0 361 27
refuses 0 361 27
to 0 361 27
publish 0 361 27
any 0 361 27
“Zionist” 0 361 27
content. 0 361 27

In 0 361 28
practice, 0 361 28
this 0 361 28
prevents 0 361 28
McGill’s 0 361 28
Jewish 0 361 28
community 0 361 28
from 0 361 28
defending 0 361 28
itself 0 361 28
against 0 361 28
the 1 361 28
absurd 1 361 28
attacks 1 361 28
to 0 361 28
which 0 361 28
it 0 361 28
is 0 361 28
subjected. 0 361 28

If 0 361 29
the 0 361 29
Daily 0 361 29
is 0 361 29
committed 0 361 29
to 0 361 29
systematically 0 361 29
excluding 0 361 29
the 0 361 29
voices 0 361 29
of 0 361 29
an 0 361 29
ethno-religious 0 361 29
community 0 361 29
on 0 361 29
campus, 0 361 29
then 0 361 29
it 0 361 29
cannot 0 361 29
continue 0 361 29
to 0 361 29
receive 0 361 29
automatic 0 361 29
student 0 361 29
funding, 0 361 29
as 0 361 29
it 0 361 29
does 0 361 29
now. 0 361 29

The 0 361 30
double 0 361 30
standard 0 361 30
here 0 361 30
is 0 361 30
pretty 0 361 30
clear. 0 361 30

“At 0 367 23
this 0 367 23

however, 0 367 23
we 0 367 23

homeschooling 1 369 23
curriculum. 0 369 23

The 0 369 24
Ron 0 369 24
Paul 0 369 24
Curriculum 0 369 24
provides 0 369 24
students 0 369 24
with 0 369 24
a 0 369 24
well-rounded 1 369 24
education 1 369 24
that 0 369 24
includes 0 369 24
rigorous 0 369 24
programs 0 369 24
in 0 369 24
history, 0 369 24
mathematics, 0 369 24
and 0 369 24
the 0 369 24
physical 0 369 24
and 0 369 24
natural 0 369 24
sciences. 0 369 24

The 0 369 25
curriculum 0 369 25
also 0 369 25
provides 0 369 25
instruction 0 369 25
in 0 369 25
personal 0 369 25
finance. 0 369 25

Students 0 369 26
can 0 369 26
develop 0 369 26
superior 0 369 26
oral 0 369 26
and 0 369 26
verbal 0 369 26
communication 0 369 26
skills 0 369 26
via 0 369 26
intensive 0 369 26
writing 0 369 26
and 0 369 26
public 0 369 26
speaking 0 369 26
courses. 0 369 26

Another 0 369 27
feature 0 369 27
of 0 369 27
my 1 369 27
curriculum 1 369 27
is 0 369 27
that 0 369 27
it 0 369 27
provides 0 369 27
students 0 369 27
the 0 369 27
opportunity 0 369 27
to 0 369 27
create 0 369 27
and 0 369 27
run 0 369 27
their 0 369 27
own 0 369 27
internet 0 369 27
businesses. 0 369 27

The 0 369 28
government 0 369 28
and 0 369 28
history 0 369 28
sections 0 369 28
of 0 369 28
the 0 369 28
curriculum 0 369 28
emphasize 0 369 28
Austrian 0 369 28
economics, 0 369 28
libertarian 0 369 28
political 0 369 28
theory, 0 369 28
and 0 369 28
the 0 369 28
history 0 369 28
of 0 369 28
liberty. 0 369 28

However, 0 369 29
unlike 0 369 29
government 0 369 29
schools, 0 369 29
my 1 369 29
curriculum 1 369 29
never 0 369 29
puts 0 369 29
ideological 0 369 29
indoctrination 1 369 29
ahead 0 369 29
of 0 369 29
education. 0 369 29

While 0 369 30
government 0 369 30
schools 0 369 30
— 0 369 30
and 0 369 30
even 0 369 30
many 0 369 30
private 0 369 30
schools 0 369 30
— 0 369 30
pretend 0 369 30
religion 0 369 30
played 0 369 30
no 0 369 30
significant 0 369 30
role 0 369 30
in 0 369 30
history, 0 369 30
my 1 369 30
curriculum 1 369 30
addresses 0 369 30
the 0 369 30
crucial 1 369 30
role 0 369 30
religion 0 369 30
played 0 369 30
in 0 369 30
the 0 369 30
development 0 369 30
of 0 369 30
Western 0 369 30
civilization. 0 369 30

However, 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
materials 0 369 31
are 0 369 31
drafted 0 369 31
in 0 369 31
such 0 369 31
a 0 369 31
way 0 369 31
that 0 369 31
any 0 369 31
Christian, 0 369 31
Jewish, 0 369 31
Muslim, 0 369 31
or 0 369 31
atheist 0 369 31
parent 0 369 31
can 0 369 31
feel 0 369 31
comfortable 0 369 31
using 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
curriculum. 0 369 31

students 0 369 32
to 0 369 32

and 0 369 32
learn 0 369 32
from 0 369 32
each 0 369 32
other. 0 369 32

The 0 369 33
forums 0 369 33
ensure 0 369 33
students 0 369 33

actively 0 369 33

Concern 0 369 34
about 0 369 34
the 0 369 34
safety 0 369 34
of 0 369 34
students 0 369 34
in 0 369 34
government-run 0 369 34
schools 0 369 34
is 0 369 34
one 0 369 34
reason 0 369 34
many 0 369 34
parents 0 369 34
are 0 369 34
considering 0 369 34
homeschooling, 1 369 34
but 0 369 34
it 0 369 34
is 0 369 34
not 0 369 34
the 0 369 34
only 0 369 34
reason. 0 369 34

Many 0 369 35
parents 0 369 35
are 0 369 35
motivated 0 369 35
by 0 369 35
a 0 369 35
desire 0 369 35
to 0 369 35
give 0 369 35
their 0 369 35
children 0 369 35
something 0 369 35
better 0 369 35
than 0 369 35
a 0 369 35
curriculum 0 369 35
that 0 369 35
has 0 369 35
been 0 369 35
dumbed 1 369 35
down 1 369 35
by 0 369 35
federal 0 369 35
initiatives 0 369 35
like 0 369 35
Common 0 369 35
Core. 0 369 35

Other 0 369 36
parents 0 369 36
do 0 369 36
not 0 369 36
wish 0 369 36
to 0 369 36
have 0 369 36
their 0 369 36
children 0 369 36
indoctrinated 1 369 36
with 0 369 36
views 0 369 36
that 0 369 36
contradict 0 369 36
the 0 369 36
parents’ 0 369 36

social, 0 369 36
or 0 369 36

Leftists 0 370 42
have 0 370 42
said 0 370 42
the 0 370 42
connection 0 370 42
is 0 370 42
unfair, 0 370 42
because 0 370 42
Waters’ 0 370 42

only 0 370 42
calling 0 370 42

My 0 370 43
question 0 370 43
is; 0 370 43
how 0 370 43
big 0 370 43
of 0 370 43
a 0 370 43
leap 0 370 43
would 0 370 43
it 0 370 43
be 0 370 43
for 0 370 43
a 0 370 43
normal, 0 370 43
rational 0 370 43
adult 0 370 43
to 0 370 43
go 0 370 43
from 0 370 43
confronting 0 370 43
administration 0 370 43
officials 0 370 43
to 0 370 43
attacking 0 370 43
the 0 370 43

who 0 370 43
elected 0 370 43
them 0 370 43

Not 0 370 44
much 0 370 44
in 0 370 44
my 0 370 44
mind. 0 370 44

The 0 370 45
reality 0 370 45
is 0 370 45
that 0 370 45
the 0 370 45

the 0 373 12
Israeli 0 373 12
Ministry 0 373 12
of 0 373 12
Intelligence, 0 373 12
echoed 0 373 12
the 0 373 12
FDD: 0 373 12
"If 1 373 12
you 1 373 12
(Americans) 1 373 12
are 1 373 12
committed 1 373 12
to 1 373 12
countering 1 373 12
Iran 1 373 12
in 1 373 12
the 1 373 12
region, 1 373 12
then 1 373 12
you 1 373 12
must 1 373 12
do 1 373 12
so 1 373 12
in 1 373 12
Syria--first." 1 373 12

Our 0 373 13
orders 0 373 13
have 0 373 13
been 0 373 13
cut. 0 373 13

Iran 0 373 14
has 0 373 14
dismissed 0 373 14
as 0 373 14
"lies" 1 373 14
and 1 373 14
"ridiculous" 1 373 14
the 0 373 14
charge 0 373 14
that 0 373 14
it 0 373 14
sent 0 373 14
the 0 373 14
drone 0 373 14
into 0 373 14
Israeli 0 373 14
airspace. 0 373 14

If 0 373 15
Tehran 0 373 15
did, 0 373 15
it 0 373 15
would 0 373 15
be 0 373 15
an 0 373 15
act 0 373 15
of 0 373 15
monumental 1 373 15
stupidity. 1 373 15

Not 0 373 16
only 0 373 16
did 0 373 16
the 0 373 16
drone 0 373 16
bring 0 373 16
devastating 0 373 16
Israeli 0 373 16
reprisals 0 373 16
against 0 373 16
Syria 0 373 16
and 0 373 16
embarrass 0 373 16
Iran's 0 373 16
ally 0 373 16
Russia, 0 373 16
it 0 373 16
brought 0 373 16
attacks 0 373 16
on 0 373 16
Russian-provided 0 373 16
and 0 373 16
possibly 0 373 16
Russian-manned 0 373 16
air 0 373 16
defenses. 0 373 16

Moreover, 0 373 17
in 0 373 17
recent 0 373 17
months 0 373 17
Iranian 0 373 17
policy--suspending 0 373 17
patrol 0 373 17
boat 0 373 17
harassment 0 373 17
of 0 373 17
U.S. 0 373 17
warships--appears 0 373 17
crafted 0 373 17
to 0 373 17
ease 0 373 17
tensions 0 373 17
and 0 373 17
provide 0 373 17
no 0 373 17
new 0 373 17
causes 0 373 17
for 0 373 17
Trump 0 373 17
to 0 373 17
abandon 0 373 17

Prime 0 373 17
Minister 0 373 17
Hassan 0 373 17
Rouhani 0 373 17
regards 0 373 17
as 0 373 17
his 0 373 17
legacy. 0 373 17

Indeed, 0 373 18
why 0 373 18
would 0 373 18
Iran, 0 373 18
which, 0 373 18
with 0 373 18
Assad, 0 373 18
Russia 0 373 18
and 0 373 18
Hezbollah, 0 373 18
is 0 373 18
among 0 373 18
the 0 373 18
victors 0 373 18
in 0 373 18
Syria's 0 373 18
six-year 0 373 18
civil 0 373 18
war, 0 373 18
wish 0 373 18
to 0 373 18
reignite 0 373 18
the 0 373 18
bloodletting 0 373 18
and 0 373 18
bring 0 373 18
Israeli 0 373 18
and 0 373 18
U.S. 0 373 18
firepower 0 373 18
in 0 373 18
on 0 373 18
the 0 373 18
other 0 373 18
side? 0 373 18

In 0 373 19
Syria's 0 373 19
southeast, 0 373 19
another 0 373 19
incident 0 373 19
a 0 373 19
week 0 373 19
ago 0 373 19
may 0 373 19
portend 0 373 19
an 0 373 19
indefinite 0 373 19
U.S. 0 373 19
stay 0 373 19
in 0 373 19
that 0 373 19
broken 0 373 19
and 0 373 19
bleeding 0 373 19
country. 0 373 19

To 0 373 20
recapture 0 373 20
oil 0 373 20
fields 0 373 20
lost 0 373 20
in 0 373 20
the 0 373 20
war, 0 373 20
forces 0 373 20
backed 0 373 20
by 0 373 20
Assad 0 373 20
crossed 0 373 20
the 0 373 20
Euphrates 0 373 20
into 0 373 20
territory 0 373 20
taken 0 373 20
from 0 373 20
ISIS 0 373 20
by 0 373 20
the 0 373 20
U.S. 0 373 20
and 0 373 20
our 0 373 20
Kurd 0 373 20
allies. 0 373 20

The 0 373 21
U.S. 0 373 21
response 0 373 21
was 0 373 21
a 0 373 21
barrage 0 373 21
of 0 373 21
air 0 373 21
and 0 373 21
artillery 0 373 21
strikes 0 373 21
that 0 373 21
killed 0 373 21
100 0 373 21
soldiers. 0 373 21

What 0 373 22
this 0 373 22
signals 0 373 22
is 0 373 22
that, 0 373 22
though 0 373 22
ISIS 0 373 22
has 0 373 22
been 0 373 22
all 0 373 22
but 0 373 22
evicted 0 373 22
from 0 373 22
Syria, 0 373 22
the 0 373 22
U.S. 0 373 22
intends 0 373 22
to 0 373 22
retain 0 373 22
that 0 373 22
fourth 0 373 22
of 0 373 22
Syria 0 373 22
as 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
bargaining 1 373 22
chip 1 373 22
in 0 373 22
negotiations. 0 373 22

In 0 373 23
the 0 373 23
northwest, 0 373 23
Turkey 0 373 23
has 0 373 23
sent 0 373 23
its 0 373 23
Syrian 0 373 23
allies 0 373 23
to 0 373 23
attack 0 373 23
Afrin 0 373 23
and 0 373 23
President 0 373 23
Recep 0 373 23
Tayyip 0 373 23
Erdogan 0 373 23
has 0 373 23
threatened 0 373 23
Manbij, 0 373 23
80 0 373 23
miles 0 373 23
to 0 373 23
the 0 373 23
east, 0 373 23
where 0 373 23
U.S. 0 373 23
troops 0 373 23
commingle 0 373 23
with 0 373 23
the 0 373 23
Kurd 0 373 23
defenders 0 373 23
and 0 373 23
U.S. 0 373 23
generals 0 373 23
were 0 373 23
visible 0 373 23
last 0 373 23
week. 0 373 23

Midweek, 0 373 24
Erdogan 1 373 24
exploded: 1 373 24
"(The 0 373 24
Americans) 0 373 24
tell 0 373 24
us, 0 373 24
'Don't 0 373 24
come 0 373 24
to 0 373 24
Manbij.' 0 373 24

We 0 373 25
will 0 373 25
come 0 373 25
to 0 373 25
Manbij 0 373 25
to 0 373 25
hand 0 373 25
over 0 373 25
these 0 373 25
territories 0 373 25
to 0 373 25
their 0 373 25
rightful 0 373 25
owners." 0 373 25

The 0 373 26
U.S. 0 373 26
and 0 373 26
Turkey, 0 373 26
allies 0 373 26
for 0 373 26
six 0 373 26
decades, 0 373 26
with 0 373 26
the 0 373 26
largest 0 373 26
armies 0 373 26
in 0 373 26
NATO, 0 373 26
may 0 373 26
soon 0 373 26
be 0 373 26
staring 0 373 26
down 0 373 26
each 0 373 26
other's 0 373 26
gun 0 373 26
barrels. 0 373 26

Has 1 373 27
President 1 373 27
Trump 1 373 27
thought 1 373 27
through 1 373 27
where 1 373 27
we 1 373 27
are 1 373 27
going 1 373 27
with 1 373 27
this 1 373 27
deepening 1 373 27
commitment 1 373 27
in 1 373 27
Syria, 1 373 27
where 0 373 27
we 0 373 27
have 0 373 27
only 0 373 27
2,000 0 373 27
troops 0 373 27
and 0 373 27
no 0 373 27
allies 0 373 27
but 0 373 27
the 0 373 27
Kurds, 0 373 27
while 0 373 27
on 0 373 27
the 0 373 27
other 0 373 27
side 0 373 27
is 0 373 27
the 0 373 27
Syrian 0 373 27
army, 0 373 27
Hezbollah, 0 373 27
Russia 0 373 27
and 0 373 27
Iran, 0 373 27
and 0 373 27
Shiite 0 373 27
militias 0 373 27
from 0 373 27
Iraq, 0 373 27
Afghanistan 0 373 27
and 0 373 27
Pakistan? 0 373 27

Clearly, 0 373 28
we 0 373 28
have 0 373 28
an 0 373 28
obligation 0 373 28
not 0 373 28
to 0 373 28
abandon 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
Kurds, 0 373 28
who 0 373 28
took 0 373 28
most 0 373 28
of 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
casualties 0 373 28
in 0 373 28
liberating 0 373 28
eastern 0 373 28
Syria 0 373 28
from 0 373 28
ISIS. 0 373 28

And 0 373 29
we 0 373 29
have 0 373 29
a 0 373 29
strategic 0 373 29
interest 0 373 29
in 0 373 29
not 0 373 29
losing 0 373 29
Turkey 0 373 29
as 0 373 29
an 0 373 29
ally. 0 373 29

But 0 373 30
this 0 373 30
calls 0 373 30
for 0 373 30
active 1 373 30
diplomacy, 1 373 30
not 1 373 30
military 1 373 30
action. 1 373 30

And 0 373 31
now 0 373 31
that 0 373 31
the 0 373 31
rebels 0 373 31
have 0 373 31
been 0 373 31
defeated 0 373 31
and 0 373 31
the 0 373 31
civil 0 373 31
war 0 373 31
is 0 373 31
almost 0 373 31
over, 0 373 31
what 0 373 31
would 0 373 31
be 0 373 31
the 0 373 31
cost 0 373 31
and 0 373 31
what 0 373 31
would 0 373 31
be 0 373 31
the 0 373 31
prospects 0 373 31
of 0 373 31
fighting 0 373 31
a 0 373 31
new 0 373 31
and 0 373 31
wider 0 373 31
war? 0 373 31

What 0 373 32
would 0 373 32
victory 0 373 32
look 0 373 32
like? 0 373 32

Bibi 0 373 33
and 0 373 33
the 0 373 33
FDD 0 373 33
want 0 373 33
to 0 373 33
see 0 373 33
U.S. 0 373 33
power 0 373 33
deployed 0 373 33
alongside 0 373 33
that 0 373 33
of 0 373 33
Israel, 0 373 33
against 0 373 33
Iran, 0 373 33
Assad 0 373 33
and 0 373 33
Hezbollah. 0 373 33

But 0 373 34
while 0 373 34
Israel's 0 373 34
interests 0 373 34
are 0 373 34
clear, 0 373 34
what 1 373 34
would 1 373 34
be 1 373 34
the 1 373 34
U.S. 1 373 34
vital 1 373 34
interest? 1 373 34

What 1 373 35
outcome 1 373 35
would 1 373 35
justify 1 373 35
another 1 373 35
U.S. 1 373 35
war 1 373 35
in 1 373 35
a 1 373 35
region 1 373 35
where 1 373 35
all 1 373 35
the 1 373 35
previous 1 373 35
wars 1 373 35
in 1 373 35
this 1 373 35
century 1 373 35
have 1 373 35
left 1 373 35
us 1 373 35
bleeding, 1 373 35
bankrupt, 1 373 35
divided 1 373 35
and 1 373 35
disillusioned? 1 373 35

When 1 373 36
he 1 373 36
was 1 373 36
running 1 373 36
, 1 373 36
Donald 1 373 36

seemed 1 373 36
to 1 373 36
understand 1 373 36
this. 1 373 36

The 0 375 1
media 0 375 1
very 1 375 1
deliberately 1 375 1
misreported 0 375 1
the 0 375 1
Bundy 0 375 1
standoff, 0 375 1
ridiculing 1 375 1
the 0 375 1
men 0 375 1
involved 0 375 1
and 0 375 1
shrugging 1 375 1
at 1 375 1
the 1 375 1
murder 1 375 1
of 0 375 1
LaVoy 0 375 1
Finicum. 0 375 1

When 0 375 2
the 0 375 2
court 0 375 2
case 0 375 2
completely 1 375 2
collapsed, 1 375 2
the 0 375 2
media 0 375 2
buried 0 375 2
the 0 375 2
story. 0 375 2

Just 0 375 3
as 0 375 3
it 0 375 3
failed 0 375 3
to 0 375 3
provide 0 375 3
any 0 375 3
meaningful 0 375 3
information 0 375 3
about 0 375 3
the 0 375 3
background 0 375 3
of 0 375 3
the 0 375 3
case. 0 375 3

That 0 375 4
was 0 375 4
in 0 375 4
part 0 375 4
because 1 375 4
it 1 375 4
would 1 375 4
have 1 375 4
been 1 375 4
damaging 1 375 4
to 1 375 4
Obama. 1 375 4

And 0 375 5
because 0 375 5
they 0 375 5
didn't 0 375 5
care. 0 375 5

But 0 375 6
President 0 375 6
Trump 0 375 6
listened 0 375 6
to 0 375 6
the 0 375 6
voices 0 375 6
asking 0 375 6
him 0 375 6
for 0 375 6
justice. 0 375 6

The 0 375 9
evidence 0 375 9
at 0 375 9
trial 0 375 9
regarding 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
Hammonds’ 0 375 9
responsibility 0 375 9
for 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
fire 0 375 9
was 0 375 9
conflicting, 0 375 9
and 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
jury 0 375 9
acquitted 0 375 9
them 0 375 9
on 0 375 9
most 0 375 9
of 0 375 9
the 0 375 9
charges. 0 375 9

At 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
Hammonds’ 0 375 10
original 0 375 10
sentencing, 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
judge 0 375 10
noted 0 375 10
that 0 375 10
they 0 375 10
are 0 375 10
respected 0 375 10
in 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
community 0 375 10
and 0 375 10
that 0 375 10
imposing 0 375 10
the 0 375 10
mandatory 0 375 10
minimum, 0 375 10
5-year 0 375 10
prison 0 375 10
sentence 0 375 10
would 0 375 10
“shock 1 375 10
the 1 375 10
conscience” 1 375 10
and 0 375 10
be 0 375 10
“grossly 1 375 10
disproportionate 1 375 10
to 1 375 10
the 1 375 10
severity” 1 375 10
of 0 375 10
their 0 375 10
conduct. 0 375 10

As 0 375 11
a 0 375 11
result, 0 375 11
the 0 375 11
judge 0 375 11
imposed 0 375 11
significantly 0 375 11
lesser 0 375 11
sentences. 0 375 11

The 0 375 12
previous 0 375 12
administration, 0 375 12
however, 0 375 12
filed 0 375 12
an 0 375 12
overzealous 1 375 12
appeal 0 375 12
that 0 375 12
resulted 0 375 12
in 0 375 12
the 0 375 12
Hammonds 0 375 12
being 0 375 12
sentenced 0 375 12
to 0 375 12
five 0 375 12
years 0 375 12
in 0 375 12
prison. 0 375 12

This 0 375 13
was 0 375 13
unjust. 1 375 13

Dwight 0 375 14

approximately 0 375 14
three 0 375 14
years 0 375 14
in 0 375 14
prison 0 375 14

The 0 375 15
same 0 375 15

that 0 375 15
was 0 375 15
against 0 375 15
mandatory 0 375 15
minimums 0 375 15
for 0 375 15
its 0 375 15
drug 0 375 15

Antiterrorism 0 375 15

Act. 0 375 15

While 1 375 16
Obama 1 375 16
pardoned 1 375 16
drug 1 375 16
dealers 1 375 16
and 1 375 16
locked 1 375 16

Trump 1 375 16
pardons 1 375 16
ranchers 1 375 16

Both 0 375 17
men 0 375 17
are 0 375 17
currently 0 375 17
in 0 375 17
prison 0 375 17
on 0 375 17
five-year 0 375 17
sentences, 0 375 17
thanks 0 375 17
in 0 375 17
part 0 375 17
to 0 375 17
a 0 375 17
1996 0 375 17
antiterrorism 0 375 17
law 0 375 17
that 0 375 17
imposed 0 375 17

mandatory 0 375 17
minimum 0 375 17
sentence 0 375 17
on 0 375 17
certain 0 375 17
crimes 0 375 17
on 0 375 17
federal 0 375 17
land. 0 375 17

The 0 375 18
length 0 375 18
of 0 375 18
their 0 375 18
prison 0 375 18
terms, 0 375 18
in 0 375 18
part, 0 375 18
fueled 1 375 18
outrage 1 375 18
at 0 375 18
their 0 375 18
convictions. 0 375 18

Federal 0 375 19
Judge 0 375 19
Michael 0 375 19
Robert 0 375 19
Hogan 0 375 19
originally 0 375 19
gave 0 375 19
the 0 375 19
Hammonds 0 375 19
reduced 0 375 19
sentences 0 375 19
in 0 375 19
2012, 0 375 19
arguing 0 375 19
that 0 375 19
the 0 375 19
mandatory 0 375 19
minimums 0 375 19
were 0 375 19
unjust. 1 375 19

But 0 375 20
the 0 375 20
Obama 0 375 20
administration 0 375 20
appealed, 0 375 20
and 0 375 20

Judge 0 375 20
Ann 0 375 20
Aiken 0 375 20
in 0 375 20

the 0 375 20
full 0 375 20
five-year 0 375 20
sentences. 0 375 20

Hogan 0 375 21
was 0 375 21

Bush 0 375 21
appointee 0 375 21
who 0 375 21
respected 0 375 21
the 0 375 21
law. 0 375 21

Aiken 0 375 22
was 0 375 22
a 0 375 22
Dem 1 375 22
fundraiser, 1 375 22
her 0 375 22

party, 0 375 22
appointed 0 375 22
by 0 375 22
Bill 0 375 22
Clinton. 0 375 22

Aiken 0 375 23
was 0 375 23
unqualified 1 375 23
for 0 375 23
her 0 375 23
role, 0 375 23
except 0 375 23
in 0 375 23
the 0 375 23
ways 0 375 23
that 0 375 23
mattered 0 375 23
to 0 375 23
the 0 375 23
Clintons 0 375 23
and 0 375 23
their 0 375 23

“We 0 378 2

I've 0 378 16
often 0 378 16
said 0 378 16
if 0 378 16

we 0 378 16

not 0 378 16
even 0 378 16
bring 0 378 16
them 0 378 16
into 0 378 16

if 0 378 16
they 0 378 16

them 0 378 16
back 0 378 16
over 0 378 16

by 0 378 17

years 0 378 17
to 0 378 17
deport 0 378 17
them, 0 378 17
which 0 378 17
costs 0 378 17
the 0 378 17
American 1 378 17
people 1 378 17
lots 0 378 17
of 0 378 17
money. 0 378 17

That 0 378 18
system 0 378 18
would 0 378 18
require 0 378 18
more 0 378 18
judges 0 378 18
to 0 378 18
handle 0 378 18
more 0 378 18
illegals 0 378 18
and 0 378 18
Trump 0 378 18
ripped 0 378 18
the 0 378 18
calls 0 378 18
for 0 378 18
more 0 378 18
judges 0 378 18
in 0 378 18
favor 0 378 18
of 0 378 18
a 0 378 18
more 0 378 18
"simple 0 378 18
immigration 0 378 18
plan." 0 378 18

“We 0 378 19
want 0 378 19
strong 0 378 19
borders 0 378 19
and 0 378 19
we 0 378 19
want 0 378 19
no 0 378 19
crime,” 0 378 19
Trump 0 378 19
said. 0 378 19

“The 1 378 20
Democrats 1 378 20
want 1 378 20
open 1 378 20
borders 1 378 20
and 1 378 20
they 1 378 20
don’t 1 378 20
care 1 378 20
about 1 378 20
crime.” 1 378 20

Trump 0 378 21
then 0 378 21
called 0 378 21
on 0 378 21
Congress 0 378 21
to 0 378 21
correct 0 378 21
the 0 378 21
problems 0 378 21
created 0 378 21
by 0 378 21
legislation 0 378 21
with 0 378 21
more 0 378 21
legislation. 0 378 21

“The 0 378 22
laws 0 378 22
are 0 378 22
obsolete, 0 378 22
the 0 378 22
laws 0 378 22
are 0 378 22
horrible, 1 378 22
having 0 378 22
to 0 378 22
do 0 378 22
with 0 378 22
the 0 378 22
border, 0 378 22
both 0 378 22
in 0 378 22
terms 0 378 22
of 0 378 22
security 0 378 22
and 0 378 22
in 0 378 22
terms 0 378 22
of 0 378 22
taking 0 378 22
care 0 378 22
of 0 378 22
people,” 0 378 22
he 0 378 22
said. 0 378 22

“We 1 378 23
want 1 378 23
children 1 378 23
staying 1 378 23
together,” 1 378 23
Trump 0 378 23
said, 0 378 23
blasting 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
New 0 378 23
York 0 378 23
Times 0 378 23
report 0 378 23
that 0 378 23
said 0 378 23
he 0 378 23
didn't 0 378 23
really 0 378 23
want 0 378 23
to 0 378 23
sign 0 378 23
his 0 378 23
executive 0 378 23
order 0 378 23
last 0 378 23
week 0 378 23
that 0 378 23
would 0 378 23
keep 0 378 23
families 0 378 23
together 0 378 23
in 0 378 23
detention 0 378 23
while 0 378 23
they 0 378 23
awaited 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
judicial 0 378 23
process. 0 378 23

Of 0 378 24
course, 0 378 24
Trump 0 378 24
has 0 378 24
inherited 0 378 24
a 0 378 24
problem 0 378 24
that 0 378 24
has 0 378 24
existed 0 378 24
for 0 378 24
several 0 378 24
administrations, 0 378 24
both 0 378 24
Republican 0 378 24
and 0 378 24
Democrat, 0 378 24
for 0 378 24
decades. 0 378 24

It 0 378 25
is 0 378 25
time 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
Congress 0 378 25
sure 0 378 25
up 0 378 25
things 0 378 25
so 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
America's 1 378 25
tax 1 378 25
dollars 1 378 25
are 0 378 25
not 0 378 25
bound 0 378 25
up 0 378 25
in 0 378 25
a 0 378 25
worthless 1 378 25
judicial 0 378 25
process 0 378 25
when 0 378 25
people 0 378 25
are 0 378 25
clearly 0 378 25
in 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
country 0 378 25
illegally. 0 378 25

Sadly, 0 378 26
too 0 378 26
many 0 378 26
people 0 378 26
want 0 378 26
more 0 378 26
amnesty 0 378 26
which 0 378 26
begs 0 378 26
the 0 378 26
question 0 378 26
if 0 378 26
any 0 378 26
of 0 378 26
them 0 378 26
take 0 378 26
the 0 378 26

Pilger’s 0 379 6
Statement 0 379 6

“There 0 379 7
is 0 379 7

The 1 379 11
fakery 1 379 11
of 0 379 11
Russia-gate, 0 379 11
the 0 379 11

of 0 379 11

not 1 379 12

the 1 379 13

We 0 379 18
continue 0 379 18
our 0 379 18
discussion 0 379 18
of 0 379 18
the 0 379 18

Julian 0 379 18

John 0 379 19

it 0 379 19

you 0 379 19
again. 0 379 19

But 0 379 20
it 0 379 20
is 0 379 20
a 1 379 20
profound 1 379 20
tragedy, 1 379 20
John, 0 379 20
the 0 379 20
way 0 379 20
they 0 379 20
are 0 379 20
treating 0 379 20
Julian 0 379 20
Assange, 0 379 20
this 0 379 20
prolific 1 379 20
journalist 1 379 20
and 1 379 20
publisher 1 379 20
who 0 379 20
so 0 379 20
many 0 379 20
other 0 379 20

have 0 379 20
depended 0 379 20
on 0 379 20
in 0 379 20
the 0 379 20
past. 0 379 20

He 0 379 21
has 0 379 21
been 0 379 21
totally 1 379 21
left 1 379 21
out 1 379 21
in 1 379 21
the 1 379 21
cold 1 379 21

himself. 1 379 21

John 0 379 22

I 0 379 22
have 0 379 22
never 0 379 22
known 0 379 22
anything 0 379 22
like 0 379 22
it. 0 379 22

There 0 379 23
is 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
kind 0 379 23
of 0 379 23
eerie 1 379 23
silence 1 379 23
around 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Julian 0 379 23
Assange 0 379 23
case. 0 379 23

Julian 0 379 24
has 0 379 24
been 0 379 24
vindicated 0 379 24
in 0 379 24
every 0 379 24
possible 0 379 24
way 0 379 24
and 0 379 24
yet 0 379 24
he 0 379 24
is 0 379 24
isolated 0 379 24
as 0 379 24
few 0 379 24

recently 0 379 26
and 0 379 26
I 0 379 26
couldn’t 0 379 26
see 0 379 26
him, 0 379 26
although 0 379 26
I 0 379 26
spoke 0 379 26
to 0 379 26
people 0 379 26
who 0 379 26
had 0 379 26
seen 0 379 26
him. 0 379 26

Rafael 0 379 27
Correa, 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
former 0 379 27
president 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
Ecuador, 0 379 27
said 0 379 27
recently 0 379 27
that 0 379 27
he 1 379 27
regarded 1 379 27
what 1 379 27
they 1 379 27
are 1 379 27
doing 1 379 27
to 1 379 27
Julian 1 379 27
now 1 379 27
as 1 379 27
torture. 1 379 27

It 0 379 28
was 0 379 28
Correa’s 0 379 28
government 0 379 28
that 0 379 28
gave 0 379 28
Julian 0 379 28
political 0 379 28
refuge, 0 379 28
which 0 379 28
has 0 379 28
been 0 379 28
betrayed 0 379 28
now 0 379 28
by 0 379 28
his 0 379 28
successor, 0 379 28
the 0 379 28
government 0 379 28
led 0 379 28
by 0 379 28
Lenin 0 379 28
Moreno, 0 379 28
which 0 379 28
is 0 379 28
back 0 379 28
to 0 379 28
sucking 1 379 28
up 1 379 28
to 1 379 28
the 1 379 28
United 1 379 28
States 1 379 28
in 1 379 28
the 1 379 28
time-honored 1 379 28
way, 1 379 28
with 0 379 28
Julian 0 379 28
as 0 379 28
the 0 379 28
pawn 0 379 28
and 0 379 28
victim. 0 379 28

Should 0 379 29
be 0 379 29
a 1 379 29
‘Constitutional 1 379 29
Hero’ 1 379 29

But 0 379 30
really 0 379 30
it 0 379 30
comes 0 379 30
down 0 379 30
to 0 379 30
the 0 379 30
British 0 379 30
government. 0 379 30

Although 0 379 31
he 0 379 31
is 0 379 31
still 0 379 31
in 0 379 31
a 0 379 31
foreign 0 379 31
embassy 0 379 31
and 0 379 31
actually 0 379 31
has 0 379 31
Ecuadorian 0 379 31
nationality, 0 379 31
his 0 379 31
right 0 379 31
of 0 379 31
passage 0 379 31
out 0 379 31
of 0 379 31
that 0 379 31
embassy 0 379 31
should 0 379 31
be 0 379 31
guaranteed 0 379 31
by 0 379 31
the 0 379 31
British 0 379 31
government. 0 379 31

The 0 379 32
United 0 379 32
Nations 0 379 32
Working 0 379 32
Party 0 379 32
on 0 379 32
Unlawful 0 379 32
Detentions 0 379 32
has 0 379 32
made 0 379 32
that 0 379 32
clear. 0 379 32

Britain 0 379 33
took 0 379 33
part 0 379 33
in 0 379 33
an 0 379 33
investigation 0 379 33
which 0 379 33
determined 0 379 33
that 0 379 33
Julian 0 379 33
was 0 379 33
a 0 379 33
political 0 379 33
refugee 0 379 33
and 0 379 33
that 0 379 33
a 1 379 33
great 1 379 33
miscarriage 1 379 33
of 1 379 33
justice 1 379 33
had 0 379 33
been 0 379 33
imposed 0 379 33
on 0 379 33
him. 0 379 33

It 0 379 34
is 0 379 34
very 0 379 34
good 0 379 34
that 0 379 34
you 0 379 34
are 0 379 34
doing 0 379 34
this, 0 379 34
Dennis, 0 379 34
because 0 379 34
even 0 379 34
in 0 379 34
the 0 379 34
media 0 379 34
outside 0 379 34
the 0 379 34
mainstream, 0 379 34
there 0 379 34
is 0 379 34
this 0 379 34
silence 0 379 34
about 0 379 34
Julian. 0 379 34

The 0 379 35
streets 0 379 35
outside 0 379 35
the 0 379 35
embassy 0 379 35
are 1 379 35
virtually 1 379 35
empty, 1 379 35
whereas 0 379 35
they 1 379 35
should 1 379 35
be 1 379 35
full 1 379 35
of 1 379 35
people 1 379 35
saying 1 379 35
that 1 379 35
we 1 379 35
are 1 379 35
with 1 379 35
you. 1 379 35

The 0 379 36
principles 0 379 36
involved 0 379 36
in 0 379 36
this 0 379 36
case 0 379 36
are 0 379 36
absolutely 1 379 36
clear-cut. 1 379 36

Number 0 379 37
one 0 379 37
is 0 379 37
justice. 0 379 37

The 1 379 38
injustice 1 379 38
done 1 379 38
to 1 379 38
this 1 379 38
man 1 379 38
is 1 379 38
legion, 1 379 38
both 0 379 38
in 0 379 38
terms 0 379 38
of 0 379 38
the 1 379 38
bogus 1 379 38
Swedish 1 379 38
case 1 379 38
and 0 379 38
now 0 379 38
the 0 379 38
fact 0 379 38
that 0 379 38
he 0 379 38
must 0 379 38
remain 0 379 38
in 0 379 38
the 0 379 38
embassy 0 379 38
and 0 379 38
can’t 0 379 38
leave 0 379 38
without 0 379 38
being 0 379 38
arrested, 0 379 38
extradited 0 379 38
to 0 379 38
the 0 379 38
United 0 379 38
States 0 379 38
and 0 379 38
ending 1 379 38
up 1 379 38
in 1 379 38
a 1 379 38
hell 1 379 38
hole. 1 379 38

But 1 379 39
it 1 379 39
is 1 379 39
also 1 379 39
about 1 379 39
freedom 1 379 39
of 1 379 39
speech, 1 379 39
about 1 379 39
our 1 379 39
right 1 379 39
to 1 379 39
know, 1 379 39
which 1 379 39
is 1 379 39
enshrined 1 379 39
in 1 379 39
the 1 379 39
United 1 379 39
States 1 379 39
Constitution. 1 379 39

If 0 379 40
the 0 379 40
Constitution 0 379 40
were 0 379 40
taken 0 379 40
literally, 0 379 40
Julian 0 379 40
would 0 379 40
be 0 379 40
a 1 379 40
constitutional 1 379 40
hero, 1 379 40
actually. 0 379 40

Instead, 0 379 41
I 0 379 41
understand 0 379 41
the 0 379 41
indictment 0 379 41
they 0 379 41
are 0 379 41
trying 0 379 41
to 0 379 41
concoct 0 379 41
reads 0 379 41
like 0 379 41
a 0 379 41
charge 0 379 41
of 0 379 41
espionage! 0 379 41

It’s 1 379 42
so 1 379 42
ridiculous.That 1 379 42
is 0 379 42
the 0 379 42
situation 0 379 42
as 0 379 42
I 0 379 42
see 0 379 42
it, 0 379 42
Dennis. 0 379 42

It 0 379 43
is 0 379 43
not 0 379 43
a 0 379 43
happy 0 379 43
one 0 379 43
but 0 379 43
it 0 379 43
is 0 379 43
one 0 379 43
that 0 379 43
people 0 379 43
should 0 379 43
rally 0 379 43
to 0 379 43
quickly. 0 379 43

DB: 0 379 44
His 1 379 44
journalistic 1 379 44
brethren 1 379 44
are 0 379 44
sounding 0 379 44
like 0 379 44
his 0 379 44
prosecutors. 0 379 44

They 0 379 45
want 0 379 45
to 0 379 45
get 0 379 45
behind 0 379 45
Russia-gate 1 379 45
freaks 1 379 45
like 0 379 45
Congressman 0 379 45
Adam 0 379 45
Schiff 0 379 45
and 0 379 45
Mike 0 379 45
Pompeo, 0 379 45
who 0 379 45
would 0 379 45
like 0 379 45
to 0 379 45
see 0 379 45
Assange 0 379 45
in 1 379 45
jail 1 379 45
forever 1 379 45
or 1 379 45
even 1 379 45
executed. 1 379 45

How 0 379 46
do 0 379 46
you 0 379 46
respond 0 379 46
to 0 379 46
journalists 0 379 46
acting 0 379 46
like 0 379 46
prosecutors, 0 379 46
some 0 379 46
of 0 379 46
whom 0 379 46
used 0 379 46
his 0 379 46
material 0 379 46
to 0 379 46
do 0 379 46
stories? 0 379 46

This 0 379 47
is 0 379 47
a 0 379 47
terrible 0 379 47
time 0 379 47
for 0 379 47
journalism. 0 379 47

JP: 0 379 48
You 0 379 48
are 0 379 48
absolutely 0 379 48
right: 0 379 48
It 0 379 48
is 0 379 48
a 0 379 48
terrible 0 379 48
time 0 379 48
for 0 379 48
journalism. 0 379 48

I 1 379 49
have 1 379 49
never 1 379 49
known 1 379 49
anything 1 379 49
quite 1 379 49
like 1 379 49
it 1 379 49
in 1 379 49
my 1 379 49
career. 1 379 49

That 0 379 50
said, 0 379 50
it 0 379 50
is 0 379 50
not 0 379 50
new. 0 379 50

There 0 379 51
has 0 379 51
always 0 379 51
been 0 379 51
a 0 379 51
so-called 0 379 51
mainstream 0 379 51
which 0 379 51
really 0 379 51
comes 0 379 51
down 0 379 51
to 0 379 51
great 0 379 51
power 0 379 51
in 0 379 51
media. 0 379 51

It 0 379 52
has 0 379 52
always 0 379 52
existed, 0 379 52
particularly 0 379 52
in 0 379 52
the 0 379 52
United 0 379 52
States. 0 379 52

The 0 379 53
Pulitzer 0 379 53
Prize 0 379 53
this 0 379 53
year 0 379 53
was 0 379 53
awarded 0 379 53
to 0 379 53
The 0 379 53
New 0 379 53
York 0 379 53
Times 0 379 53
and 0 379 53
The 0 379 53
Washington 0 379 53
Post 0 379 53
for 0 379 53
witch-hunting 1 379 53
around 1 379 53
Russia-gate! 1 379 53

They 0 379 54
were 0 379 54
praised 0 379 54
for 0 379 54
“how 0 379 54
deeply 0 379 54
sourced 0 379 54
their 0 379 54
investigations 0 379 54
were.” 0 379 54
Their 1 379 54
investigations 1 379 54
turned 1 379 54
up 1 379 54
not 1 379 54
a 1 379 54
shred 1 379 54
of 1 379 54
real 1 379 54
evidence 1 379 54
to 0 379 54
suggest 0 379 54
any 0 379 54
serious 0 379 54
Russian 0 379 54
intervention 0 379 54
in 0 379 54
the 0 379 54
2016 0 379 54
election. 0 379 54

Like 0 379 55
Webb 0 379 55

The 0 379 56
Julian 0 379 56
Assange 0 379 56
case 0 379 56
reminds 0 379 56
me 0 379 56
of 0 379 56
the 0 379 56
Gary 0 379 56
Webb 0 379 56
case. 0 379 56

Bob 0 379 57
Parry 0 379 57
was 0 379 57
one 0 379 57
of 0 379 57
Gary 0 379 57
Webb’s 0 379 57
few 0 379 57
supporters 0 379 57
in 0 379 57
the 0 379 57
media. 0 379 57

Webb’s 0 379 58
“Dark 0 379 58
Alliance” 0 379 58
series 0 379 58
contained 0 379 58
evidence 0 379 58
that 0 379 58
cocaine 0 379 58
trafficking 0 379 58
was 0 379 58
going 0 379 58
on 0 379 58
with 0 379 58
the 0 379 58
connivance 0 379 58
of 0 379 58
the 0 379 58
CIA. 0 379 58

Later 0 379 59
Webb 0 379 59
was 1 379 59
hounded 1 379 59
by 0 379 59
fellow 0 379 59
journalists 0 379 59
and, 0 379 59
unable 0 379 59
to 0 379 59
find 0 379 59
work, 0 379 59
he 0 379 59
eventually 0 379 59
committed 0 379 59
suicide. 0 379 59

The 0 379 60
CIA 0 379 60
Inspector 0 379 60
General 0 379 60
subsequently 0 379 60
vindicated 0 379 60
him. 0 379 60

Now, 0 379 61
Julian 0 379 61
Assange 0 379 61
is 0 379 61
a 0 379 61
long 0 379 61
way 0 379 61
from 0 379 61
taking 0 379 61
his 0 379 61
own 0 379 61
life. 0 379 61

His 0 379 62
resilience 0 379 62
is 0 379 62
remarkable. 0 379 62

But 0 379 63
he 0 379 63
is 0 379 63
still 0 379 63
a 0 379 63
human 0 379 63
being 0 379 63
and 0 379 63
he 0 379 63
has 0 379 63
taken 1 379 63
such 1 379 63
a 1 379 63
battering. 1 379 63

Probably 0 379 64
the 0 379 64
hardest 0 379 64
thing 0 379 64
for 0 379 64
him 0 379 64
to 0 379 64
take 0 379 64
is 0 379 64
the 1 379 64
utter 1 379 64
hypocrisy 1 379 64
of 1 379 64
news 1 379 64
organizations—like 1 379 64
The 0 379 64
New 0 379 64
York 0 379 64
Times, 0 379 64
which 0 379 64
published 0 379 64
the 0 379 64
WikiLeaks 0 379 64
“War 0 379 64
Logs” 0 379 64
and 0 379 64
“Cablegate,” 0 379 64
The 0 379 64
Washington 0 379 64
Post 0 379 64
and 0 379 64
The 0 379 64
Guardian, 0 379 64
which 0 379 64
has 0 379 64
taken 0 379 64
a 1 379 64
vindictive 1 379 64
delight 1 379 64
in 1 379 64
tormenting 1 379 64
Julian. 1 379 64

The 0 379 65
Guardian 0 379 65
a 0 379 65
few 0 379 65
years 0 379 65
ago 0 379 65
got 0 379 65
a 0 379 65
Pulitzer 0 379 65
Prize 0 379 65
writing 0 379 65
about 0 379 65
Snowden. 0 379 65

But 0 379 66
their 0 379 66
coverage 0 379 66
of 0 379 66
Snowden 0 379 66
left 0 379 66
him 0 379 66
in 0 379 66
Hong 0 379 66
Kong. 0 379 66

It 0 379 67
was 0 379 67
WikiLeaks 0 379 67
that 0 379 67
got 0 379 67
Snowden 0 379 67
out 0 379 67
of 0 379 67
Hong 0 379 67
Kong 0 379 67

to 0 379 67
safety. 0 379 67

Professionally, 0 379 68
I 1 379 68
find 1 379 68
this 1 379 68
one 1 379 68
of 1 379 68
the 1 379 68
most 1 379 68
unsavory 1 379 68
and 1 379 68
immoral 1 379 68
things 1 379 68
I 1 379 68
have 1 379 68
seen 1 379 68
in 1 379 68
my 1 379 68
career. 1 379 68

The 0 379 69
persecution 0 379 69
of 0 379 69
this 0 379 69
man 0 379 69
by 0 379 69
huge 0 379 69
media 0 379 69
organizations 0 379 69
which 0 379 69
have 0 379 69
drawn 0 379 69
great 0 379 69
benefit 0 379 69
from 0 379 69
WikiLeaks. 0 379 69

One 1 379 70
of 1 379 70
Assange’s 1 379 70
great 1 379 70
tormentors, 1 379 70
The 1 379 70
Guardian‘s 1 379 70
Luke 1 379 70
Harding, 1 379 70
made 0 379 70
a 0 379 70
great 0 379 70
deal 0 379 70
of 0 379 70
money 0 379 70
with 0 379 70
a 0 379 70
Hollywood 0 379 70
version 0 379 70
of 0 379 70
a 0 379 70
book 0 379 70
that 0 379 70
he 0 379 70
and 0 379 70
David 0 379 70
Lee 0 379 70
wrote 0 379 70
in 0 379 70
which 0 379 70
they 0 379 70
basically 0 379 70
attacked 0 379 70
their 0 379 70
source. 0 379 70

I 0 379 71
suppose 0 379 71
you 0 379 71
have 0 379 71
to 0 379 71
be 0 379 71
a 0 379 71
psychiatrist 0 379 71
to 0 379 71
understand 0 379 71
all 0 379 71
of 0 379 71
this. 0 379 71

My 0 379 72
understanding 0 379 72
is 0 379 72
that 0 379 72
so 0 379 72
many 0 379 72
of 0 379 72
these 0 379 72
journalists 0 379 72
are 0 379 72
shamed. 0 379 72

They 0 379 73
realize 0 379 73
that 0 379 73
WikiLeaks 0 379 73
has 0 379 73
done 0 379 73
what 0 379 73
they 0 379 73
should 0 379 73
have 0 379 73
done 0 379 73
a 0 379 73
long 0 379 73
time 0 379 73
ago, 0 379 73
and 0 379 73
that 0 379 73
is 0 379 73
to 0 379 73
tell 0 379 73
us 0 379 73
how 0 379 73
governments 0 379 73
lie. 0 379 73

DB: 0 379 74
One 0 379 74
thing 0 379 74
that 0 379 74
disturbs 0 379 74
me 0 379 74
greatly 0 379 74
is 0 379 74
the 0 379 74
way 0 379 74
in 0 379 74
which 0 379 74
the 0 379 74
Western 0 379 74
corporate 0 379 74
press 0 379 74
speculate 0 379 74
about 0 379 74
Russian 0 379 74
involvement 0 379 74
in 0 379 74
the 0 379 74
U.S. 0 379 74
2016 0 379 74
election, 0 379 74
that 0 379 74
it 1 379 74
was 1 379 74
a 1 379 74
hack 1 379 74
through 1 379 74
Julian 1 379 74
Assange. 1 379 74

Any 0 379 75
serious 0 379 75
investigator 0 379 75
would 0 379 75
want 0 379 75
to 0 379 75
know 0 379 75
who 0 379 75
would 0 379 75
be 0 379 75
motivated. 0 379 75

And 0 379 76
yet 0 379 76
the 0 379 76
possibility 0 379 76
that 0 379 76
it 0 379 76
might 0 379 76
be 0 379 76
the 1 379 76
dozen 1 379 76
or 1 379 76
so 1 379 76
pissed-off 1 379 76
people 1 379 76

went 0 379 76
to 0 379 76
work 0 379 76
for 0 379 76
the 1 379 76
Clinton 1 379 76
machine 1 379 76

learned 0 379 76
from 0 379 76
the 0 379 76
inside 0 379 76
that 0 379 76
the 0 379 76

all 0 379 76
about 0 379 76
getting 0 379 76
rid 0 379 76
of 0 379 76
Bernie 0 379 76
Sanders…this 0 379 76
is 0 379 76
not 0 379 76
a 0 379 76
part 0 379 76
of 0 379 76
the 0 379 76
story! 0 379 76

Eight 0 379 77
Hundred 0 379 77

Disclosures 0 379 77
on 0 379 77

JP: 0 379 78
What 0 379 78
happened 0 379 78
to 0 379 78
Sanders 0 379 78
and 0 379 78
the 0 379 78
way 0 379 78
that 0 379 78
he 1 379 78
was 1 379 78
rolled 1 379 78
by 1 379 78
the 1 379 78

organization, 1 379 78
everybody 0 379 78
knows 0 379 78
that 0 379 78
this 0 379 78
is 0 379 78
the 0 379 78
story. 0 379 78

And 0 379 79
now 0 379 79
we 0 379 79
have 0 379 79
the 0 379 79
DNC 0 379 79
suing 0 379 79
WikiLeaks! 0 379 79

There’s 0 379 80
a 0 379 80
kind 0 379 80
of 0 379 80
farcical 1 379 80
element 1 379 80
to 0 379 80
this. 0 379 80

I 0 379 81
mean, 0 379 81
none 0 379 81

this 0 379 81

from 0 379 81
the 0 379 81

That 0 379 82
WikiLeaks 0 379 82
is 0 379 82
somehow 0 379 82
in 1 379 82
bed 1 379 82
with 1 379 82
the 1 379 82
Russians 1 379 82
is 1 379 82
ludicrous. 1 379 82

WikiLeaks 0 379 83
published 0 379 83
about 0 379 83
800,000 0 379 83

his 0 379 85

his 0 379 85
decision 0 379 85
to 0 379 85

a 0 379 85
very 0 379 85
high-profile 0 379 85
series 0 379 85
to 0 379 85
the 0 379 85

discussion 0 379 86
with 0 379 86

out 1 379 86
“What 0 379 86
about 0 379 86
Julian 0 379 86

attacked 0 379 86

dragged 0 379 86
out. 0 379 86

shouted 0 379 88
some 0 379 88
truth. 0 379 88

It 0 379 89
is 0 379 89
very 0 379 89
similar 0 379 89
to 0 379 89
what 0 379 89
happened 0 379 89

of 0 379 90

extremely 0 379 90
principled. 0 379 90

these 0 379 92
four 0 379 92
armed 0 379 92

kept 0 379 92

“Stop 0 379 92

beating 1 379 92
the 1 379 92
hell 1 379 92
out 1 379 92
of 1 379 92
him! 1 379 92

I 0 379 93
thought 0 379 93
the 0 379 93
image 0 379 93
of 0 379 93
Ray 0 379 93
being 1 379 93
hauled 1 379 93
off 1 379 93

particularly 0 379 93
telling. 0 379 93

These 1 379 94
four 1 379 94
overweight, 1 379 94
obviously 1 379 94
ill-trained 1 379 94
young 1 379 94

manhandling 1 379 94
Ray, 0 379 94
who 0 379 94
is 0 379 94
78 0 379 94
years 0 379 94
old. 0 379 94

something 0 379 95
highly 0 379 95
emblematic 0 379 95
about 0 379 95
that 0 379 95
for 0 379 95
me. 0 379 95

He 0 379 96
stood 0 379 96
up 0 379 96
to 0 379 96
challenge 0 379 96
the 0 379 96
fact 0 379 96
that 0 379 96
the 0 379 96
CIA 0 379 96
was 0 379 96
about 0 379 96
to 0 379 96
hand 0 379 96
over 0 379 96
leadership 0 379 96
to 0 379 96
a 0 379 96
person 0 379 96
who 0 379 96
had 0 379 96
been 0 379 96
in 0 379 96
charge 0 379 96
of 0 379 96
torture. 0 379 96

It 0 379 97
is 0 379 97
both 1 379 97
shocking 1 379 97
and 1 379 97
surreal, 1 379 97
which 0 379 97
of 0 379 97
course 0 379 97
the 0 379 97
Julian 0 379 97
Assange 0 379 97
case 0 379 97
is 0 379 97
as 0 379 97
well. 0 379 97

But 0 379 98
real 0 379 98
journalism 0 379 98
should 0 379 98
be 0 379 98
able 0 379 98
to 0 379 98
get 0 379 98
through 0 379 98
the 1 379 98
shocking 1 379 98
and 1 379 98
the 1 379 98
surreal 1 379 98

get 0 379 98
to 0 379 98
the 0 379 98
truth. 0 379 98

There 0 379 99
is 0 379 99
so 0 379 99
much 0 379 99
collusion 0 379 99
now, 0 379 99
with 0 379 99
all 0 379 99
these 0 379 99
dark 1 379 99
and 1 379 99
menacing 1 379 99
developments. 1 379 99

It 0 379 100
is 0 379 100
almost 0 379 100
as 0 379 100
if 0 379 100
the 1 379 100
word 1 379 100
“journalism” 1 379 100
is 1 379 100
becoming 1 379 100
blighted. 1 379 100

DB: 0 379 101
There 0 379 101
has 0 379 101
certainly 0 379 101
been 0 379 101
a 0 379 101
lot 0 379 101
of 0 379 101
collusion 0 379 101

it 0 379 101
comes 0 379 101

Then 0 379 102
the 0 379 102
word 0 379 102
“collusion” 0 379 102
is 0 379 102
quite 0 379 102
appropriate. 0 379 102

JP:That’s 0 379 103
the 0 379 103
ultimate 0 379 103
collusion. 0 379 103

that’s 0 379 104
collusion 1 379 104
with 0 379 104
silence. 0 379 104

Never 1 379 105
has 1 379 105
there 1 379 105
been 1 379 105
a 1 379 105
collusion 1 379 105

another 0 379 106
word 0 379 106

that 0 379 106
is 0 379 106
“immunity.” 0 379 106

moral 0 379 106

We 0 379 107
see 0 379 107
the 0 379 107
gunning 1 379 107
down 1 379 107
of 0 379 107

the 0 379 107
day 0 379 107

the 0 379 107

Israel 0 379 108
has 0 379 108
some 1 379 108
of 1 379 108
the 1 379 108

in 1 379 108
the 1 379 108

and 0 379 108
they 0 379 108
fired 0 379 108
them 0 379 108
at 0 379 108
people 0 379 108
who 0 379 108
were 0 379 108
protesting 0 379 108
the 0 379 108
occupation 0 379 108
of 0 379 108
their 0 379 108
homeland 0 379 108
and 0 379 108
trying 0 379 108
to 0 379 108

people 0 379 108
of 0 379 108

In 0 379 109
the 0 379 109

these 0 379 109
were 0 379 109
described 0 379 109
as 0 379 109
“clashes.” 0 379 109
Although 0 379 109
they 0 379 109
did 0 379 109
become 0 379 109

A 0 379 110

back 0 379 115
to 0 379 115
when 0 379 115
WikiLeaks 0 379 115
started, 0 379 115
when 0 379 115
Julian 0 379 115
was 0 379 115
sitting 0 379 115
in 0 379 115
his 0 379 115

first 0 379 115
things 0 379 115
he 0 379 115
wrote 0 379 115
was 0 379 115
that 0 379 115
there 0 379 115
is 0 379 115
a 0 379 115
morality 0 379 115
in 0 379 115
transparency, 0 379 115
that 0 379 115
we 0 379 115

a 0 379 115
right 0 379 115
to 0 379 115

what 0 379 115
those 0 379 115

our 0 379 115

are 0 379 115
doing 0 379 115
in 0 379 115
secret. 0 379 115

The 0 379 116
right 0 379 116
to 0 379 116

our 0 379 116

Julian 0 379 117
feels 0 379 117
very 0 379 117
passionately 0 379 117
about 0 379 117
this. 0 379 117

There 0 379 118
were 0 379 118
times 0 379 118
when 0 379 118
he 0 379 118
could 0 379 118
have 0 379 118
compromised 0 379 118
slightly 0 379 118
in 0 379 118
order 0 379 118
to 0 379 118
possibly 0 379 118
help 0 379 118
his 0 379 118
situation. 0 379 118

There 0 379 119
were 0 379 119
times 0 379 119
when 0 379 119
I 0 379 119
said 0 379 119
to 0 379 119
him, 0 379 119
“Why 0 379 119
don’t 0 379 119
you 0 379 119
just 0 379 119
suspend 0 379 119
that 0 379 119
for 0 379 119
a 0 379 119
while 0 379 119
and 0 379 119
go 0 379 119
along 0 379 119
with 0 379 119
it?” 0 379 119
Of 0 379 119
course, 0 379 119
I 0 379 119
knew 0 379 119
beforehand 0 379 119
what 0 379 119
his 0 379 119
answer 0 379 119
would 0 379 119
be 0 379 119
and 0 379 119
that 0 379 119
was 0 379 119
“no.” 0 379 119
The 0 379 119
enormous 0 379 119
amount 0 379 119
of 0 379 119
information 0 379 119
that 0 379 119
has 0 379 119
come 0 379 119
from 0 379 119
WikiLeaks, 0 379 119
particularly 0 379 119
in 0 379 119
recent 0 379 119
years, 0 379 119
has 0 379 119
amounted 0 379 119
to 0 379 119
an 1 379 119
extraordinary 1 379 119
public 1 379 119
service. 1 379 119

I 0 379 120
was 0 379 120
reading 0 379 120
just 0 379 120
the 0 379 120
other 0 379 120
day 0 379 120
a 0 379 120
2006 0 379 120
WikiLeaks 0 379 120
cable 0 379 120
from 0 379 120
the 0 379 120
U.S. 0 379 120
embassy 0 379 120
in 0 379 120
Caracas 0 379 120
which 0 379 120
was 0 379 120
addressed 0 379 120
to 0 379 120
other 0 379 120
agencies 0 379 120
in 0 379 120
the 0 379 120
region. 0 379 120

This 0 379 121
was 0 379 121
four 0 379 121
years 0 379 121
after 0 379 121
the 0 379 121
U.S. 0 379 121
tried 0 379 121
to 0 379 121
get 0 379 121
rid 0 379 121
of 0 379 121
Chavez 0 379 121
in 0 379 121
a 0 379 121
coup. 0 379 121

It 0 379 122
detailed 0 379 122
how 0 379 122
subversion 0 379 122
should 0 379 122
work. 0 379 122

Of 0 379 123
course, 0 379 123
they 1 379 123
dressed 1 379 123
it 1 379 123
up 1 379 123
as 0 379 123
human 0 379 123
rights 0 379 123
work 0 379 123
and 0 379 123
so 0 379 123
on. 0 379 123

I 0 379 124
was 0 379 124
reading 0 379 124
this 0 379 124
official 0 379 124
document 0 379 124
thinking 0 379 124
how 0 379 124
the 0 379 124
information 0 379 124
contained 0 379 124
in 0 379 124
it 0 379 124
was 0 379 124
worth 0 379 124
years 0 379 124
of 0 379 124
the 0 379 124
kind 0 379 124
of 0 379 124
distorted 0 379 124
reporting 0 379 124
from 0 379 124
Venezuela. 0 379 124

It 0 379 125
also 0 379 125
reminds 0 379 125
us 0 379 125
that 0 379 125
so-called 0 379 125
“meddling” 0 379 125
by 0 379 125
Russia 0 379 125
in 0 379 125
the 0 379 125
U.S. 0 379 125
is 0 379 125
just 0 379 125
nonsense. 0 379 125

The 0 379 126
word 0 379 126
“meddling” 0 379 126
doesn’t 0 379 126
apply 0 379 126
to 0 379 126
the 0 379 126
kind 0 379 126
of 0 379 126
action 0 379 126
implied 0 379 126
in 0 379 126
this 0 379 126
document. 0 379 126

It 0 379 127
is 0 379 127
intervention 0 379 127
in 0 379 127
another 0 379 127
country’s 0 379 127
affairs. 0 379 127

WikiLeaks 0 379 128
has 0 379 128
done 0 379 128
that 0 379 128
all 0 379 128
over 0 379 128
the 0 379 128
world. 0 379 128

It 0 379 129
has 0 379 129
given 0 379 129
people 0 379 129
the 0 379 129
information 0 379 129
they 0 379 129
have 0 379 129
a 0 379 129
right 0 379 129
to 0 379 129
have. 0 379 129

They 0 379 130
had 0 379 130
a 0 379 130
right 0 379 130
to 0 379 130
find 0 379 130
out 0 379 130
from 0 379 130
the 0 379 130
so-called 0 379 130
“War 0 379 130
Logs” 0 379 130
the 0 379 130
criminality 0 379 130
of 0 379 130
our 0 379 130
wars 0 379 130
in 0 379 130
Afghanistan 0 379 130
and 0 379 130
Iraq. 0 379 130

They 1 379 131
had 1 379 131
a 1 379 131
right 1 379 131
to 0 379 131
find 0 379 131
out 0 379 131
about 0 379 131
Cablegate. 0 379 131

That’s 0 379 132
when, 0 379 132
on 0 379 132
Clinton’s 0 379 132
watch, 0 379 132
we 0 379 132
learned 0 379 132
that 0 379 132
the 0 379 132
NSA 0 379 132
was 0 379 132
gathering 0 379 132
personal 0 379 132
information 0 379 132
on 0 379 132
members 0 379 132
of 0 379 132
the 0 379 132
United 0 379 132
Nations 0 379 132
Security 0 379 132
Council, 0 379 132
including 0 379 132
their 0 379 132
credit 0 379 132
card 0 379 132
numbers. 0 379 132

You 0 379 133
can 0 379 133
see 0 379 133
why 0 379 133
Julian 0 379 133
made 0 379 133
enemies. 0 379 133

But 0 379 134
he 0 379 134
should 0 379 134
also 0 379 134
have 0 379 134
made 0 379 134
a 0 379 134
huge 0 379 134
number 0 379 134
of 0 379 134
friends. 0 379 134

This 0 379 135
is 0 379 135
critical 0 379 135
information 0 379 135
because 0 379 135
it 0 379 135
tells 0 379 135
us 0 379 135
how 0 379 135
power 0 379 135
works 0 379 135
and 0 379 135
we 0 379 135
will 0 379 135
never 0 379 135
learn 0 379 135
about 0 379 135
it 0 379 135
otherwise. 0 379 135

I 0 379 136
think 0 379 136
WikiLeaks 0 379 136
has 0 379 136
opened 0 379 136
a 0 379 136
world 0 379 136
of 0 379 136
transparency 0 379 136
and 1 379 136
put 1 379 136
flesh 1 379 136
on 1 379 136
the 1 379 136
expression 1 379 136
“right 0 379 136
to 0 379 136
know.” 0 379 136
This 0 379 136
must 0 379 136
explain 0 379 136
why 0 379 136
he 0 379 136
is 0 379 136
attacked 0 379 136
so 0 379 136
much, 0 379 136
because 0 379 136
that 0 379 136
is 0 379 136
so 0 379 136
threatening. 0 379 136

The 1 379 137
enemy 1 379 137
to 1 379 137
great 1 379 137
power 1 379 137
is 1 379 137
not 1 379 137
the 1 379 137
likes 1 379 137
of 1 379 137
the 1 379 137
Taliban, 1 379 137
it 1 379 137
is 1 379 137
us. 1 379 137

this 0 380 43

the 0 380 43

now 0 382 4

about 0 383 2
the 0 383 2
same, 0 383 2
as 0 383 2
I 0 383 2
understand 0 383 2
it. 0 383 2

He 0 383 3
needs 0 383 3
medical 0 383 3
attention, 0 383 3
the 0 383 3
kind 0 383 3
of 0 383 3
treatment 0 383 3
you 0 383 3
get 0 383 3
only 0 383 3
in 0 383 3
a 0 383 3
hospital. 0 383 3

But 0 383 4
it 0 383 4
has 0 383 4
been 0 383 4
made 0 383 4
clear 0 383 4
to 0 383 4
him 0 383 4
that 0 383 4
if 0 383 4
he 0 383 4
attempts 0 383 4
to 0 383 4
go 0 383 4
to 0 383 4
a 0 383 4
hospital 0 383 4
he 0 383 4
will 0 383 4
not 0 383 4
be 0 383 4
given 0 383 4
free 0 383 4
passage 0 383 4
and 0 383 4
he 0 383 4
will 0 383 4
be 0 383 4
arrested. 0 383 4

Since 0 383 5
he 0 383 5
was 0 383 5
arrested 0 383 5
in 0 383 5
2010, 0 383 5
Assange 0 383 5
has 0 383 5
not 0 383 5
been 0 383 5
charged 0 383 5
with 0 383 5
a 0 383 5
single 0 383 5
crime. 0 383 5

His 0 383 6
treatment 0 383 6
amounts 0 383 6
to 0 383 6
the 1 383 6
most 1 383 6
unprecedented 1 383 6
persecution. 1 383 6

Julian 0 383 7
could 0 383 7
leave 0 383 7
the 0 383 7
embassy 0 383 7
if 0 383 7
his 1 383 7
own 1 383 7
government, 1 383 7
the 1 383 7
government 1 383 7
of 1 383 7
his 1 383 7
homeland, 1 383 7
Australia, 1 383 7
applied 1 383 7
legitimate 1 383 7
diplomatic 1 383 7
pressure 1 383 7
on 1 383 7
behalf 1 383 7
of 1 383 7
its 1 383 7
citizen. 1 383 7

We 1 383 8
must 1 383 8
ask 1 383 8
ourselves 1 383 8
why 1 383 8
this 1 383 8
hasn’t 1 383 8
happened. 1 383 8

My 0 383 9
own 0 383 9
feeling 0 383 9
is 0 383 9
that 0 383 9
there 0 383 9
is 0 383 9
a 0 383 9
great 0 383 9
deal 0 383 9
of 0 383 9
collusion 0 383 9
between 0 383 9
the 0 383 9
Australian, 0 383 9
the 0 383 9
British 0 383 9
and 0 383 9
the 0 383 9
US 0 383 9
governments–meant 0 383 9
to 0 383 9
close 0 383 9
down 0 383 9
WikiLeaks 0 383 9
completely 0 383 9
and/or 0 383 9
deliver 0 383 9
Julian 0 383 9
Assange 0 383 9
to 0 383 9
the 0 383 9
Americans. 0 383 9

Recently 0 383 10
the 0 383 10
Australian 0 383 10
foreign 0 383 10
minister, 0 383 10
Julie 0 383 10
Bishop, 0 383 10
traveled 0 383 10
with 0 383 10
senior 0 383 10
officials 0 383 10
to 0 383 10
London 0 383 10
and 0 383 10
to 0 383 10
Washington 0 383 10
and 0 383 10
raised 0 383 10
the 0 383 10
whole 0 383 10
matter 0 383 10
of 0 383 10
Julian. 0 383 10

But 0 383 11
they 0 383 11
raised 0 383 11
it 0 383 11
in 0 383 11
a 0 383 11
way 0 383 11
that 0 383 11
didn’t 0 383 11
support 0 383 11
the 0 383 11
idea 0 383 11
that 0 383 11
a 0 383 11
government 0 383 11
should 0 383 11
represent 0 383 11
its 0 383 11
citizens. 0 383 11

These 0 383 12
people 0 383 12
listened 0 383 12
to 0 383 12
the 0 383 12
more 0 383 12
powerful 0 383 12
governments. 0 383 12

In 0 383 13
Washington 0 383 13
they 0 383 13
met 0 383 13
Mr. 0 383 13
Pompeo, 0 383 13
who 0 383 13
refused 0 383 13
to 0 383 13
discuss 0 383 13
Assange 0 383 13
altogether. 0 383 13

I 0 383 14
think 0 383 14
there 0 383 14
is 0 383 14
collusion 0 383 14
which 0 383 14
amounts 0 383 14
to 0 383 14
an 0 383 14
attempt 0 383 14
to 0 383 14
try 0 383 14
to 0 383 14
do 0 383 14
a 0 383 14
deal 0 383 14
with 0 383 14
Assange 0 383 14
whereby 0 383 14
he 0 383 14
might 0 383 14
be 0 383 14
allowed 0 383 14
free 0 383 14
passage 0 383 14
of 0 383 14
return 0 383 14
to 0 383 14
Australia 0 383 14
if 0 383 14
he 0 383 14
shuts 0 383 14
down 0 383 14
WikiLeaks. 0 383 14

I 0 383 15
think 0 383 15
that 0 383 15
is 0 383 15
very, 0 383 15
very 0 383 15
likely. 0 383 15

As 0 383 16
I 0 383 16
understand 0 383 16
Julian, 0 383 16
this 0 383 16
is 0 383 16
something 1 383 16
he 1 383 16
would 1 383 16
not 1 383 16
even 1 383 16
contemplate. 1 383 16

But 0 383 17
that 0 383 17
might 0 383 17
be 0 383 17
one 0 383 17
of 0 383 17
the 0 383 17
so-called 0 383 17
“wretched 1 383 17
deals” 1 383 17
that 0 383 17
are 0 383 17
being 0 383 17
offered 0 383 17
Assange. 0 383 17

Some 0 383 18
very 0 383 18
strange 0 383 18
things 0 383 18
are 0 383 18
being 0 383 18
said 0 383 18
by 0 383 18
senior 0 383 18
members 0 383 18
of 0 383 18
these 0 383 18
two 0 383 18
governments. 0 383 18

The 0 383 19
new 0 383 19
foreign 0 383 19
secretary 0 383 19
of 0 383 19
the 0 383 19
United 0 383 19
Kingdom, 0 383 19
Jeremy 0 383 19
Hunt, 0 383 19
said 0 383 19
sarcastically 0 383 19
that 0 383 19
the 1 383 19
British 1 383 19
police 1 383 19
would 1 383 19
offer 1 383 19
Julian 1 383 19
“a 1 383 19
warm 1 383 19
welcome” 1 383 19
when 1 383 19
he 1 383 19
came 1 383 19
out, 1 383 19
when 0 383 19
he 0 383 19
would 0 383 19
face 0 383 19
serious 0 383 19
charges. 0 383 19

There 0 383 20
are 0 383 20
no 0 383 20
serious 0 383 20
charges. 0 383 20

He 0 383 21
hasn’t 0 383 21
been 0 383 21
charged 0 383 21
with 0 383 21
anything. 0 383 21

Was 0 383 23

a 0 383 23
deal 0 383 23

I 0 383 24
don’t 0 383 24
know. 0 383 24

But 0 383 25
this 0 383 25
is 0 383 25
the 1 383 25
milieu 1 383 25
of 1 383 25
machination 1 383 25
around 0 383 25

Putting 1 383 26
aside 1 383 26
freedom 1 383 26
of 1 383 26

the 1 383 26
persecution 1 383 26
of 1 383 26
this 1 383 26
man 1 383 26
has 1 383 26
been 1 383 26
something 1 383 26

should 1 383 26
horrify 1 383 26
all 1 383 26
free-thinking 1 383 26
people. 1 383 26

If 1 383 27
it 1 383 27
doesn’t 1 383 27
horrify 1 383 27
us, 1 383 27
then 1 383 27
we 1 383 27

John, 0 383 29
I 0 383 29
would 0 383 29
like 0 383 29
you 0 383 29
to 0 383 29
explain 0 383 29
once 0 383 29
again 0 383 29
why 0 383 29
Julian 0 383 29
Assange 0 383 29
is 0 383 29
such 1 383 29
a 1 383 29
significant 1 383 29
journalist, 1 383 29
why 0 383 29
so 0 383 29
many 0 383 29
journalistic 0 383 29
institutions 0 383 29
have 0 383 29
collaborated 0 383 29

him 0 383 29
based 0 383 29
on 0 383 29
the 0 383 29
information 0 383 29
he 0 383 29
provided. 0 383 29

We 0 383 30
are 0 383 30
talking 0 383 30
about 0 383 30
a 1 383 30
publisher 1 383 30
and 1 383 30
reporter 1 383 30
who 1 383 30
has 1 383 30
changed 1 383 30
history. 1 383 30

JP: 0 383 31
Nothing 1 383 31
in 1 383 31
my 1 383 31
time 1 383 31
as 1 383 31
a 1 383 31
journalist 1 383 31
has 1 383 31
equaled 1 383 31
the 1 383 31
rise 1 383 31
of 1 383 31
WikiLeaks 1 383 31
and 1 383 31
its 1 383 31
extraordinary 1 383 31
impact 1 383 31
on 1 383 31
journalism. 1 383 31

It 0 383 32
is 0 383 32
probably 0 383 32
the 1 383 32
only 1 383 32
journalistic 1 383 32
organization 1 383 32
that 1 383 32
has 1 383 32
a 1 383 32
100% 1 383 32
record 1 383 32
of 1 383 32
accuracy 1 383 32
and 1 383 32
authenticity! 1 383 32

All 0 383 33
of 0 383 33
WikiLeaks’ 0 383 33
revelations 0 383 33
have 0 383 33
been 0 383 33
authentic. 0 383 33

And 0 383 34
it 0 383 34
has 0 383 34
been 0 383 34
done 0 383 34
“without 0 383 34
fear 0 383 34
or 0 383 34
favor.” 0 383 34
Although 0 383 34
there 0 383 34
has 0 383 34
been 0 383 34
a 0 383 34
concentration 0 383 34
on, 0 383 34
say, 0 383 34
the 0 383 34
release 0 383 34
of 0 383 34
the 0 383 34
Hillary 0 383 34

Afghan 0 383 34
war 0 383 34
logs, 0 383 34
WikiLeaks 0 383 34
has 0 383 34
released 0 383 34
information 0 383 34
that 0 383 34
people 0 383 34
have 0 383 34
a 0 383 34
right 0 383 34
to 0 383 34
know 0 383 34
across 0 383 34
the 0 383 34
spectrum. 0 383 34

It 0 383 35
has 0 383 35
released 0 383 35
something 0 383 35
like 0 383 35
800,000 0 383 35
documents 0 383 35
from 0 383 35
Russia, 0 383 35

now 0 383 35
WikiLeaks 0 383 35

accused 0 383 35
of 0 383 35
being 0 383 35
an 0 383 35
agent 0 383 35
of 0 383 35
Russia! 0 383 35

WikiLeaks’ 0 383 36
journalism 0 383 36
has 0 383 36
covered 0 383 36
a 0 383 36
universal 0 383 36
space 0 383 36
and 0 383 36
that 0 383 36
is 0 383 36
the 0 383 36
first 0 383 36
time 0 383 36
this 0 383 36
has 0 383 36
happened. 0 383 36

In 0 383 37
Tunisia, 0 383 37
the 0 383 37
release 0 383 37
of 0 383 37

of 0 383 38
what 0 383 38
their 0 383 38

government 0 383 38
was 0 383 38
doing 0 383 38
behind 0 383 38
their 0 383 38
backs. 0 383 38

In 0 383 39
Venezuela, 0 383 39
WikiLeaks 0 383 39
released 0 383 39
cables 0 383 39
which 0 383 39
described 0 383 39
in 0 383 39
great 0 383 39
detail 0 383 39
how 0 383 39
the 0 383 39
United 0 383 39

intended 0 383 39
to 0 383 39
subvert 0 383 39
the 0 383 39
government 0 383 39
of 0 383 39

These 0 383 42

the 0 383 42
close 0 383 42
role 0 383 42
that 0 383 42

a 0 383 43

doing 0 383 44

WikiLeaks 0 383 44

JP: 0 383 48
Julian 0 383 48
is 0 383 48
a 1 383 48
very 1 383 48
principled 1 383 48
individual. 1 383 48

He 0 383 49
feels 0 383 49
very 0 383 49
strongly 0 383 49
about 0 383 49
the 0 383 49
moral 0 383 49
basis 0 383 49
of 0 383 49
WikiLeaks. 0 383 49

When 0 383 50
he 0 383 50
first 0 383 50
put 0 383 50
up 0 383 50
WikiLeaks, 0 383 50
he 0 383 50
wrote 0 383 50
that 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
whole 0 383 50
idea 0 383 50

honoring 0 383 50
people’s 0 383 50
right 0 383 50

was 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
central 0 383 50
aim 0 383 50
of 0 383 50
the 0 383 50
website. 0 383 50

He 0 383 51
feels 0 383 51
that 0 383 51
very 0 383 51
strongly. 0 383 51

Any 0 383 52
attempt 0 383 52
to 0 383 52
do 0 383 52
a 0 383 52
deal 0 383 52

Julian 0 383 52
to 0 383 52
shut 0 383 52
down 0 383 52
WikiLeaks 0 383 52
will 0 383 52
no 0 383 52
doubt 0 383 52
be 0 383 52
resisted. 0 383 52

As 0 383 53
a 0 383 53
person, 0 383 53
Julian 0 383 53
is 0 383 53
an 1 383 53
extremely 1 383 53
interesting 1 383 53
man. 1 383 53

He 0 383 54
is 0 383 54
very 0 383 54
well 0 383 54
read. 0 383 54

He 0 383 55
studied 0 383 55
physics. 0 383 55

He 0 383 56
has 0 383 56
a 0 383 56
very 0 383 56
good 0 383 56
sense 0 383 56
of 0 383 56
humor, 0 383 56
and 0 383 56
I 0 383 56
have 0 383 56
often 0 383 56
laughed 0 383 56
out 0 383 56
loud 0 383 56
with 0 383 56
him 0 383 56
about 0 383 56
situations 0 383 56
that 0 383 56
others 0 383 56
might 0 383 56
consider 0 383 56
too 0 383 56
bleak 0 383 56
to 0 383 56
discuss. 0 383 56

His 0 383 57
black 0 383 57
humor 0 383 57
is 0 383 57
a 0 383 57
part 0 383 57
of 0 383 57
his 0 383 57
survival 0 383 57
kit. 0 383 57

Obviously, 0 383 58
he 0 383 58
is 0 383 58
incredibly 0 383 58
resilient. 0 383 58

Personally, 0 383 59
I 0 383 59
could 0 383 59
never 0 383 59
endure 0 383 59
what 0 383 59
he 0 383 59
has, 0 383 59
especially 0 383 59
in 0 383 59
recent 0 383 59
years. 0 383 59

But 0 383 60
this 0 383 60
comes 0 383 60
with 0 383 60
a 0 383 60
cost 0 383 60
and 0 383 60
his 0 383 60
health 0 383 60
is 0 383 60
continuing 0 383 60
to 0 383 60
deteriorate. 0 383 60

Those 0 383 61
close 0 383 61
to 0 383 61
him 0 383 61
are 0 383 61
extremely 1 383 61
worried. 1 383 61

the 0 383 64

entirely 0 383 72
the 0 383 72
case 0 383 72
in 0 383 72
Britain. 0 383 72

Since 0 383 73
the 0 383 73

empire 0 383 73

the 0 383 73
new 0 383 73

In 0 383 74
many 0 383 74

of 0 383 74
the 0 383 74
world, 0 383 74
Britain 0 383 74
is 0 383 74
still 0 383 74
the 0 383 74
biggest 0 383 74
corporate 0 383 74
investor. 0 383 74

But 0 383 75
it 1 383 75
does 1 383 75
move 1 383 75
in 1 383 75
lockstep 1 383 75
with 1 383 75
the 1 383 75
US 1 383 75

much 0 383 75
of 0 383 75
its 0 383 75
foreign 0 383 75
policy. 0 383 75

It 0 383 76
is 0 383 76
interesting 0 383 76
to 0 383 76
see 0 383 76
the 0 383 76
corruption 0 383 76
that 0 383 76
this 0 383 76
kind 0 383 76
of 0 383 76
relationship 0 383 76
produces. 0 383 76

Information 0 383 77
has 0 383 77
come 0 383 77
out 0 383 77
that 0 383 77
the 0 383 77
Crown 0 383 77
Prosecution 0 383 77
Service 0 383 77
tried 0 383 77
to 0 383 77
prevent 0 383 77
the 0 383 77
Swedes 0 383 77
from 0 383 77

up 0 383 77
the 0 383 77
case 0 383 77
against 0 383 77
Julian 0 383 77
on 0 383 77
bogus 1 383 77
sexual 1 383 77
assault 1 383 77
charges. 1 383 77

The 0 383 78
pressure 0 383 78
was 0 383 78
on 0 383 78
from 0 383 78
London 0 383 78
to 0 383 78
keep 0 383 78
it 0 383 78
going. 0 383 78

Julian 0 383 79
is 0 383 79
also 0 383 79
seen 0 383 79
as 0 383 79
defying 0 383 79
a 0 383 79
system 0 383 79
and 0 383 79
that 0 383 79
is 0 383 79
just 0 383 79
not 0 383 79
acceptable. 0 383 79

There 0 383 80
is 0 383 80
a 0 383 80
real 0 383 80
element 0 383 80
of 0 383 80
vindictiveness 0 383 80
here. 0 383 80

The 0 383 81
Crown 0 383 81
Prosecution 0 383 81
Service 0 383 81
kept 0 383 81
this 0 383 81
case 0 383 81
going 0 383 81
when 0 383 81
otherwise 0 383 81
the 0 383 81
European 0 383 81
warrant 0 383 81
put 0 383 81
out 0 383 81
by 0 383 81
the 0 383 81
Swedes 0 383 81
would 0 383 81
have 0 383 81
been 0 383 81
abandoned 0 383 81
in 0 383 81
2013. 0 383 81

When 0 383 82
Julian 0 383 82
came 0 383 82
up 0 383 82
to 0 383 82
a 0 383 82
bail 0 383 82
hearing 0 383 82
last 0 383 82
year, 0 383 82
it 1 383 82
was 1 383 82
an 1 383 82
absolute 1 383 82
disgrace. 1 383 82

The 0 383 83
judge 0 383 83
described 0 383 83
Julian’s 0 383 83
circumstances 0 383 83
as 0 383 83
if 0 383 83
he 0 383 83
were 0 383 83
on 0 383 83
some 0 383 83
sort 0 383 83
of 0 383 83
extended 0 383 83

What 1 383 84
didn’t 1 383 84

the 1 383 84

has 0 383 92
reported 0 383 92
on 0 383 92

It 0 383 93
describes 0 383 93
the 1 383 93
tsunami 1 383 93
of 1 383 93
vindictive 1 383 93
personal 1 383 93

that 0 383 93
has 0 383 93
been 0 383 93
heaped 1 383 93
upon 1 383 93
Julian 0 383 93
from 0 383 93
well-known 0 383 93

many 0 383 93
claiming 0 383 93
liberal 0 383 93

The 0 383 94
Guardian, 0 383 94
which 1 383 94
used 1 383 94

itself 1 383 94
the 1 383 94
most 1 383 94

newspaper 1 383 94

the 1 383 94
country, 1 383 94
has 0 383 94
probably 0 383 94
been 0 383 94
the 0 383 94

very 0 383 110
simple. 0 383 110

This 0 383 111
is 0 383 111
about 0 383 111
justice. 0 383 111

In 0 383 112
a 0 383 112
famous 0 383 112
speech 0 383 112
given 0 383 112
in 0 383 112
the 0 383 112

Martin 0 383 112
Niemoller, 0 383 112
he 0 383 112
said 0 383 112
that 0 383 112
first 0 383 112
the 0 383 112
Nazis 0 383 112
came 0 383 112
for 0 383 112
socialists, 0 383 112
but 0 383 112
he 0 383 112
didn’t 0 383 112
speak 0 383 112
up 0 383 112
because 0 383 112
that 0 383 112
didn’t 0 383 112
concern 0 383 112
him. 0 383 112

Then 0 383 113
they 0 383 113
came 0 383 113
for 0 383 113
trade 0 383 113
unionists, 0 383 113
but 0 383 113
he 0 383 113
didn’t 0 383 113
speak 0 383 113
up 0 383 113
because 0 383 113
that 0 383 113
didn’t 0 383 113

He 0 383 114
didn’t 0 383 114
speak 0 383 114
up 0 383 114
when 0 383 114
they 0 383 114
came 0 383 114
for 0 383 114
the 0 383 114
Jews 0 383 114
because 0 383 114

wasn’t 0 383 114
a 0 383 114

of 0 383 115

finally 0 383 115
they 0 383 115

him. 0 383 115

we 0 383 117

kept 0 383 117
quiet. 0 383 117

is 0 385 4

deadly, 0 385 5
the 0 385 5
viral 0 385 5

Where 0 385 7
did 0 385 7

from? 0 385 7

Ebola 0 385 8
virus 0 385 8
disease 0 385 8
(EVD) 0 385 8
was 0 385 8
first 0 385 8

in 0 385 8
1976 0 385 8
in 0 385 8
two 0 385 8
simultaneous 0 385 8

in 0 385 9
what 0 385 9

from 0 385 11
which 0 385 11
the 0 385 11
disease 0 385 11
takes 0 385 11
its 0 385 11
name. 0 385 11

Why 0 385 12
is 0 385 12
it 0 385 12
so 0 385 12
dangerous? 0 385 12

The 0 385 13
average 0 385 13

50 0 385 13

But 0 385 14
the 0 385 14

25 0 385 14

to 0 385 14
90 0 385 14

There 0 385 15

as 0 385 16

problems. 0 385 16

It 0 385 17
is 0 385 17
not 0 385 17
known 0 385 17
why 0 385 17
some 0 385 17
people 0 385 17
recover 0 385 17
from 0 385 17
Ebola 0 385 17

most 0 385 17
succumb 0 385 17
to 0 385 17
the 0 385 17
disease. 0 385 17

Why 0 385 18
does 0 385 18
it 0 385 18
keep 0 385 18
coming 0 385 18
back? 0 385 18

the 0 387 8
document, 0 387 8
the 0 387 8
three 0 387 8

They 0 387 9
presented 0 387 9
their 0 387 9
profession 0 387 9
“before 0 387 9
God 0 387 9
who 0 387 9
will 0 387 9
judge 0 387 9
us,” 0 387 9
in 0 387 9
response 0 387 9
to 0 387 9
certain 0 387 9
pastoral 0 387 9
norms 0 387 9
issued 0 387 9
by 0 387 9
several 0 387 9
bishops’ 0 387 9

at 0 387 9

Some 1 387 10
of 1 387 10
these 1 387 10
norms, 1 387 10
Schneider 1 387 10
told 1 387 10
LifeSiteNews, 1 387 10
give 1 387 10
“implicit 1 387 10
approval” 1 387 10
of 1 387 10
divorce 1 387 10
and 1 387 10
of 1 387 10

activity 1 387 10
outside 1 387 10

Such 1 387 11
a 1 387 11
reading 1 387 11
is 1 387 11
causing 1 387 11
“rampant 1 387 11

will 1 387 11
spread 1 387 11

three 0 387 11

said 0 387 11
in 0 387 11

“This 0 387 12
is 0 387 12
contrary 0 387 12
to 0 387 12

Revelation,” 0 387 12
Schneider 0 387 12
further 0 387 12
told 0 387 12
LifeSite, 0 387 12
adding 0 387 12
that 0 387 12

are 1 387 12
being 1 387 12
presented 1 387 12
to 1 387 12
clergy 1 387 12
and 1 387 12
faithful 1 387 12
as 1 387 12
“discernment” 1 387 12
and 1 387 12
“pastoral 1 387 12
accompaniment,” 1 387 12
or 1 387 12
a 1 387 12
“change 1 387 12
of 1 387 12
paradigm” 1 387 12
and 1 387 12

when 1 387 12
translated 1 387 12
into 1 387 12
“common 1 387 12
sense 1 387 12

tantamount 1 387 12
to 1 387 12
an 1 387 12

For 0 388 4
decades, 0 388 4
Americans 0 388 4

I 0 388 9
was 0 388 9
asleep. 0 388 9

I 1 388 10
felt 1 388 10
violated 1 388 10
all 1 388 10
over 1 388 10
again. 1 388 10

Embarrassed. 1 388 11

Belittled. 1 388 12

Humiliated. 1 388 13

How 0 388 14
dare 0 388 14
anyone 0 388 14
grab 0 388 14
my 0 388 14
breasts 0 388 14
like 0 388 14
this 0 388 14
and 0 388 14
think 0 388 14
it’s 0 388 14
funny? 0 388 14

I 0 388 15
told 0 388 15
my 0 388 15
husband 0 388 15
everything 0 388 15
that 0 388 15
happened 0 388 15
and 0 388 15
showed 0 388 15
him 0 388 15
the 0 388 15
picture. 0 388 15

I 0 388 16
wanted 0 388 16
to 0 388 16
shout 1 388 16
my 1 388 16
story 1 388 16
to 1 388 16
the 1 388 16
world 1 388 16
with 1 388 16
a 1 388 16
megaphone 1 388 16
to 0 388 16
anyone 0 388 16
who 0 388 16
would 0 388 16
listen, 0 388 16
but 0 388 16
even 0 388 16
as 0 388 16
angry 0 388 16
as 0 388 16
I 0 388 16
was, 0 388 16
I 0 388 16
was 0 388 16
worried 0 388 16
about 0 388 16
the 0 388 16
potential 0 388 16
backlash 0 388 16
and 0 388 16
damage 0 388 16
going 0 388 16
public 0 388 16
might 0 388 16
have 0 388 16
on 0 388 16
my 0 388 16
career 0 388 16
as 0 388 16
a 0 388 16
broadcaster. 0 388 16

But 0 388 17
that 0 388 17
was 0 388 17
then, 0 388 17
this 0 388 17
is 0 388 17
now. 0 388 17

I’m 1 388 18
no 1 388 18
longer 1 388 18
afraid. 1 388 18

When 0 388 19
the 0 388 19
story 0 388 19
initially 0 388 19
broke, 0 388 19
Franken 0 388 19
rushed 0 388 19
to 0 388 19
issue 0 388 19
an 0 388 19
apology… 0 388 19

“I 0 388 20
certainly 0 388 20
don’t 0 388 20
remember 0 388 20
the 0 388 20
rehearsal 0 388 20
for 0 388 20
the 0 388 20
skit 0 388 20
in 0 388 20
the 0 388 20
same 0 388 20
way, 0 388 20
but 0 388 20
I 0 388 20
send 0 388 20
my 0 388 20
sincerest 0 388 20
apologies 0 388 20
to 0 388 20
Leeann,” 0 388 20
said 0 388 20
Franken. 0 388 20

“As 0 388 21
to 0 388 21
the 0 388 21
photo, 0 388 21
it 0 388 21
was 0 388 21
clearly 0 388 21
intended 0 388 21
to 0 388 21
be 0 388 21
funny 0 388 21
but 0 388 21
wasn’t. 0 388 21

I 0 388 22
shouldn’t 0 388 22
have 0 388 22
done 0 388 22
it.” 0 388 22

Needless 0 388 23
to 0 388 23
say, 0 388 23
many 0 388 23
were 0 388 23
completely 1 388 23
unsatisfied 1 388 23
with 0 388 23
Franken’s 0 388 23
very 1 388 23
weak 1 388 23
statement. 1 388 23

In 0 388 24
fact, 0 388 24
some 0 388 24
members 0 388 24
of 0 388 24
his 0 388 24
own 0 388 24
party 0 388 24
said 0 388 24
that 0 388 24
his 0 388 24
apology 0 388 24
was 0 388 24
entirely 1 388 24
insufficient 1 388 24
and 0 388 24
are 0 388 24
calling 0 388 24
for 0 388 24
Franken 0 388 24
to 0 388 24
be 0 388 24
held 0 388 24
accountable 0 388 24
for 0 388 24
his 0 388 24
actions… 0 388 24

his 0 388 25
frustration 0 388 25
with 0 388 25
the 0 388 25
inadequacy 0 388 25
of 0 388 25
Franken’s 0 388 25
apology 0 388 25
on 0 388 25
Twitter. 0 388 25

“That 0 388 26
was 0 388 26
not 0 388 26
an 0 388 26
apology 0 388 26
and 0 388 26
was 0 388 26
an 0 388 26
insufficient 0 388 26
response 0 388 26
to 0 388 26
serious 0 388 26
allegations,” 0 388 26
Cecil 0 388 26
tweeted. 0 388 26

“Al 1 388 27
Franken 1 388 27
must 1 388 27
be 1 388 27
held 1 388 27
accountable 1 388 27
if 1 388 27
our 1 388 27
party 1 388 27
wants 1 388 27
to 1 388 27

commitment 1 388 27
to 1 388 27

& 1 388 27

This 0 388 28
scandal 0 388 28
has 0 388 28
set 0 388 28
off 0 388 28
a 0 388 28
feeding 1 388 28
frenzy 1 388 28
as 0 388 28
Internet 0 388 28
sleuths 0 388 28
search 0 388 28
for 0 388 28
other 0 388 28
incidents 0 388 28
in 0 388 28
which 0 388 28
Franken 0 388 28
has 0 388 28
acted 0 388 28
inappropriately. 0 388 28

And 0 388 29
of 0 388 29
course, 0 388 29
since 0 388 29
we 0 388 29
are 0 388 29
talking 0 388 29
about 0 388 29
Al 0 388 29
Franken, 0 388 29
it 0 388 29
wasn’t 0 388 29
exactly 0 388 29
difficult 0 388 29
to 0 388 29
find 0 388 29
material. 0 388 29

For 0 388 30
example, 0 388 30
a 0 388 30
photo 0 388 30
has 0 388 30
surfaced 0 388 30
of 0 388 30
Franken 0 388 30
grabbing 0 388 30
Joy 0 388 30
Behar 0 388 30
in 0 388 30
a 0 388 30
very 1 388 30
creepy 1 388 30
manner. 1 388 30

The 0 388 31
following 0 388 31
comes 0 388 31
from 0 388 31
Breitbart… 0 388 31

Amid 0 388 32
the 0 388 32
emergence 0 388 32
of 0 388 32
a 0 388 32
2006 0 388 32
photo 0 388 32
of 0 388 32
Al 0 388 32

journalist 0 388 32
and 0 388 32
talk 0 388 32
radio 0 388 32
anchor 0 388 32
Leeann 0 388 32
Tweeden, 0 388 32
a 0 388 32
photo 0 388 32
of 0 388 32
the 0 388 32
embattled 0 388 32
Minnesota 0 388 32
Senator 0 388 32
appearing 0 388 32
to 0 388 32
grab 0 388 32
comedian 0 388 32
Joy 0 388 32
Behar’s 0 388 32
breast 0 388 32
has 0 388 32
also 0 388 32
resurfaced. 0 388 32

Franken 0 388 33
was 0 388 33
a 0 388 33
comedian 0 388 33
before 0 388 33
he 0 388 33
ever 0 388 33
entered 0 388 33
the 0 388 33
world 0 388 33
of 0 388 33
politics, 0 388 33
and 0 388 33
we 0 388 33
understand 0 388 33
that. 0 388 33

But 0 388 34
just 0 388 34
because 0 388 34
he 0 388 34
was 0 388 34
a 0 388 34
comedian 0 388 34
does 0 388 34
not 0 388 34
mean 0 388 34
that 0 388 34
he 0 388 34
gets 0 388 34
to 0 388 34
play 0 388 34
by 0 388 34
a 0 388 34
different 0 388 34
set 0 388 34
of 0 388 34
rules. 0 388 34

There 0 388 35
appears 0 388 35
to 0 388 35
be 0 388 35
an 0 388 35
ongoing 0 388 35
pattern 0 388 35
of 0 388 35
behavior, 0 388 35
and 0 388 35
Fox 0 388 35
News 0 388 35
has 0 388 35
documented 0 388 35
some 0 388 35
of 0 388 35
the 0 388 35
other 0 388 35
incidents 0 388 35
that 0 388 35
have 0 388 35
come 0 388 35
up 0 388 35
in 0 388 35
the 0 388 35
past… 0 388 35

Franken, 0 388 36
then 0 388 36
a 0 388 36
comedian, 0 388 36
was 0 388 36
quoted 0 388 36
in 0 388 36

for 0 388 36
“Saturday 0 388 36

Franken, 0 388 37
at 0 388 37
the 0 388 37
time 0 388 37
a 0 388 37
writer 0 388 37
for 0 388 37
“SNL,” 0 388 37
suggested 0 388 37
one 0 388 37
skit 0 388 37
should 0 388 37
play 0 388 37
out 0 388 37
with 0 388 37

Minutes” 0 388 37

an 0 388 37
empty 0 388 37

on 0 388 37

Then 0 388 39
when 0 388 39

out, 0 388 39

Franken 0 388 40
was 0 388 40
quoted 0 388 40
saying. 0 388 40

The 0 388 41
article, 0 388 41
along 0 388 41
with 0 388 41
a 0 388 41
2000 0 388 41
Playboy 0 388 41
column 0 388 41
in 0 388 41
which 0 388 41

talked 0 388 41
about 0 388 41
fantasizing 1 388 41
a 1 388 41
machine 1 388 41
would 1 388 41
perform 1 388 41
oral 1 388 41

As 1 388 42
much 1 388 42
as 1 388 42
we 1 388 42
may 1 388 42
be 1 388 42
appalled 1 388 42
by 1 388 42
some 1 388 42
of 1 388 42
the 1 388 42
things 1 388 42
that 1 388 42
Al 1 388 42

has 1 388 42
done, 1 388 42
the 1 388 42
truth 1 388 42
is 1 388 42
that 1 388 42
there 1 388 42
are 1 388 42

worse 1 388 42
offenders 1 388 42

my 0 388 44

that 0 388 44
now 0 388 44

life. 1 388 45

In 0 388 46
my 0 388 46
article 0 388 46
yesterday, 0 388 46
I 0 388 46
discussed 0 388 46
how 0 388 46
one 0 388 46
Secret 0 388 46
Service 0 388 46
agent 0 388 46
is 0 388 46
charging 0 388 46
former 0 388 46
Vice-President 0 388 46
Joe 0 388 46
Biden 0 388 46
of 0 388 46
engaging 0 388 46
in 0 388 46
“Weinstein-level” 1 388 46
behavior, 1 388 46
and 0 388 46
I 0 388 46
also 0 388 46
talked 0 388 46
about 0 388 46
how 0 388 46
15 0 388 46
million 0 388 46
dollars 0 388 46
in 0 388 46
settlements 0 388 46
have 0 388 46
been 0 388 46
secretly 0 388 46
paid 0 388 46
out 0 388 46
to 0 388 46
victims 0 388 46
of 0 388 46
sexual 0 388 46
harassment 0 388 46
in 0 388 46
the 0 388 46
House 0 388 46
of 0 388 46
Representatives 0 388 46
in 0 388 46
recent 0 388 46
years. 0 388 46

There 1 388 47
is 1 388 47
a 1 388 47
culture 1 388 47
of 1 388 47
corruption 1 388 47
in 1 388 47
Washington 1 388 47
D.C., 1 388 47
and 1 388 47
we 1 388 47
desperately 1 388 47
need 1 388 47
to 1 388 47
drain 1 388 47
the 1 388 47
swamp. 1 388 47

If 1 388 48
you 1 388 48
agree, 1 388 48
I 1 388 48
hope 1 388 48
that 1 388 48
you 1 388 48
will 1 388 48
support 1 388 48
my 1 388 48
campaign 1 388 48
and 1 388 48
the 1 388 48
campaigns 1 388 48
of 1 388 48
other 1 388 48
anti-establishment 1 388 48
candidates 1 388 48
that 1 388 48
want 1 388 48
to 1 388 48
clean 1 388 48
up 1 388 48
the 1 388 48
halls 1 388 48
of 1 388 48
Congress. 1 388 48

It 0 388 49
is 0 388 49
time 0 388 49
to 0 388 49
take 0 388 49
our 0 388 49
government 0 388 49
back 0 388 49
because 0 388 49
at 0 388 49
this 0 388 49
point 0 388 49
it 0 388 49
has 0 388 49
become 0 388 49
an 0 388 49
absolutely 1 388 49
disgusting 1 388 49
cesspool 1 388 49
of 1 388 49

In 0 392 31
astronomy, 0 392 31
a 0 392 31
light-year 0 392 31
is 0 392 31
a 0 392 31
commonly 0 392 31
used 0 392 31
unit 0 392 31
to 0 392 31
measure 0 392 31
distance, 0 392 31
but 0 392 31
some 0 392 31
astronomers 0 392 31
prefer 0 392 31
to 0 392 31
use 0 392 31
a 0 392 31
unit 0 392 31
called 0 392 31
the 0 392 31
parsec. 0 392 31

When 0 392 32
referring 0 392 32
to 0 392 32
something 0 392 32
larger, 0 392 32
they 0 392 32
use 0 392 32
kiloparsecs, 0 392 32
which 0 392 32
are 0 392 32
equal 0 392 32
to 0 392 32
1,000 0 392 32
parsecs, 0 392 32
and 0 392 32
megaparsecs, 0 392 32
equal 0 392 32
to 0 392 32
one 0 392 32

The 0 392 33

about 0 392 33
100,000 0 392 33

30 0 392 33

This 0 392 34
may 0 392 34
seem 0 392 34
large, 0 392 34
but 0 392 34
it 0 392 34
is 0 392 34
rather 0 392 34
small 0 392 34
when 0 392 34

has 0 392 35
an 0 392 35
approximate 0 392 35
diameter 0 392 35
of 0 392 35
220,000 0 392 35
light 0 392 35
years, 0 392 35
which 0 392 35
is 0 392 35
more 0 392 35
than 0 392 35
double 0 392 35
of 0 392 35
that 0 392 35
of 0 392 35
the 0 392 35
Milky 0 392 35

It 0 392 36

If 0 392 37

bright 0 392 37
enough, 0 392 37
the 0 392 37

would 0 392 37
appear 0 392 37

to 1 393 9

North 0 393 9
Korea 0 393 9
and 0 393 9
the 0 393 9

it 0 393 9
could 0 393 9
pose 0 393 9

Japan 0 393 9
and 0 393 9
South 0 393 9
Korea. 0 393 9

Trump 0 393 10
sought 0 393 10
to 0 393 10
set 0 393 10
up 0 393 10
Kim 0 393 10
as 0 393 10
a 0 393 10
bogeyman, 1 393 10
and 0 393 10
himself 0 393 10
as 0 393 10
America’s 1 393 10
savior. 1 393 10

Trump 0 393 11
knew 0 393 11
perfectly 1 393 11
well 1 393 11
that 0 393 11
he 0 393 11
could 0 393 11
not 0 393 11
destroy 0 393 11
all 0 393 11
of 0 393 11
North 0 393 11
Korea’s 0 393 11
deeply 0 393 11
buried 0 393 11
nuclear-armed 0 393 11
missiles, 0 393 11
and, 0 393 11
in 0 393 11
spite 0 393 11
of 0 393 11
his 0 393 11
huffing 0 393 11
and 0 393 11
puffing, 0 393 11
had 1 393 11
no 1 393 11
stomach 1 393 11
for 1 393 11
an 1 393 11
invasion 1 393 11
of 0 393 11
North 0 393 11
Korea 0 393 11
that 0 393 11
could 0 393 11
cost 0 393 11
the 0 393 11
US 0 393 11
an 0 393 11
estimated 0 393 11
250,000 0 393 11
casualties. 0 393 11

So 0 393 12
Trump’s 0 393 12
solution 0 393 12
was 0 393 12
more 0 393 12
show-biz. 1 393 12

A 0 393 13
much 1 393 13
ballyhooed 1 393 13
flight 0 393 13
to 0 393 13
Singapore, 0 393 13
backslapping 0 393 13
a 0 393 13

Kim, 0 393 13
and 0 393 13
a 0 393 13

between 0 393 13
the 0 393 13
two 0 393 13
chunky 1 393 13
leaders 0 393 13
was 1 393 13
sold 1 393 13
to 1 393 13
Americans 0 393 13
as 0 393 13
the 0 393 13
dawn 0 393 13
of 0 393 13
peace. 0 393 13

America’s 0 393 14
media 0 393 14
was 0 393 14
quick 0 393 14
to 0 393 14
retail 0 393 14
the 0 393 14
story 0 393 14
and 0 393 14
burnish 1 393 14
Trump’s 0 393 14
credentials 0 393 14
among 0 393 14
the 0 393 14
seriously 0 393 14
credulous. 0 393 14

No 0 393 15
more 0 393 15
hiding 0 393 15
under 0 393 15
your 0 393 15
school 0 393 15
desks 0 393 15
or 0 393 15
in 0 393 15
dank 0 393 15
basements. 0 393 15

As 0 393 16
Trump 0 393 16
grandly 1 393 16
proclaimed, 0 393 16
Americans 1 393 16
no 1 393 16
longer 1 393 16
have 1 393 16
to 1 393 16
fear 1 393 16
North 1 393 16
Korea 1 393 16
and 0 393 16
can 1 393 16
sleep 1 393 16
peacefully 1 393 16
at 1 393 16
night! 1 393 16

Why? 1 393 17

Korea 0 393 18
still 0 393 18
has 0 393 18
all 0 393 18
of 0 393 18
its 0 393 18
medium 0 393 18
and 0 393 18
long-ranged 0 393 18
missiles 0 393 18
and 0 393 18
an 0 393 18
estimated 0 393 18
40 0 393 18
or 0 393 18
more 0 393 18
nuclear 0 393 18
warheads. 0 393 18

The 0 393 19
North 0 393 19
is 0 393 19
developing 0 393 19
submarines 0 393 19
that 0 393 19
can 0 393 19
launch 0 393 19
nuclear-armed 0 393 19
missiles 0 393 19
from 0 393 19
underwater 0 393 19
off 0 393 19
America’s 0 393 19
coasts. 0 393 19

For 0 393 20
Kim, 0 393 20
these 0 393 20
weapons 0 393 20
are 0 393 20
purely 0 393 20
defensive, 0 393 20
designed 0 393 20
to 0 393 20
prevent 0 393 20
a 0 393 20
US 0 393 20
attack 0 393 20
on 0 393 20
his 0 393 20
nation. 0 393 20

But 0 393 21
he 0 393 21
is 0 393 21
now 0 393 21
a 0 393 21
full-fledged 0 393 21
member 0 393 21
of 0 393 21
the 0 393 21
nuclear 0 393 21
club. 0 393 21

Equally 0 393 22
important, 0 393 22
North 0 393 22
Korea 0 393 22
still 0 393 22
has 0 393 22
an 0 393 22
estimated 0 393 22
14,000 0 393 22
170mm 0 393 22
guns 0 393 22
and 0 393 22
hundreds 0 393 22
of 0 393 22
300mm 0 393 22
long-ranged 0 393 22

launchers 0 393 22
emplaced 0 393 22
in 0 393 22
caves 0 393 22
just 0 393 22
north 0 393 22
of 0 393 22
the 0 393 22
Demilitarized 0 393 22
Zone 0 393 22
between 0 393 22
the 0 393 22
two 0 393 22
Koreas. 0 393 22

They 0 393 23
threaten 0 393 23
almost 0 393 23
all 0 393 23
of 0 393 23
South 0 393 23

and 0 393 23

notably 0 393 23

This 0 393 24
is 0 393 24
a 1 393 24
very 1 393 24
real 1 393 24
threat 1 393 24

There 0 393 28

of 0 393 28
this 0 393 28

But 0 393 29
it 0 393 29
was 0 393 29
agreed 0 393 29
to 0 393 29
temporarily 0 393 29

a 0 393 29
key 0 393 29

by 0 393 29
Kim. 0 393 29

This 0 393 30
column 0 393 30
has 0 393 30
been 0 393 30
calling 0 393 30
for 0 393 30
their 0 393 30
end 0 393 30
for 0 393 30
a 0 393 30
decade. 0 393 30

North 0 393 31
Korea 0 393 31
will 0 393 31
seemingly 0 393 31
halt 0 393 31
its 0 393 31
missile 0 393 31
tests. 0 393 31

This 0 393 32
is 0 393 32
not 0 393 32
the 0 393 32
‘denuclearization’ 0 393 32
of 0 393 32
North 0 393 32
Korea 0 393 32
that 0 393 32
has 0 393 32
been 0 393 32
bandied 0 393 32
about. 0 393 32

There 0 393 33
may 0 393 33
be 0 393 33
a 0 393 33
few 0 393 33
gestures 0 393 33
of 0 393 33
disarmament 0 393 33
but 0 393 33
Kim 0 393 33
must 0 393 33
know 0 393 33
that 0 393 33
his 0 393 33
nukes 0 393 33
are 0 393 33
his 0 393 33
means 0 393 33
of 0 393 33
survival. 0 393 33

In 0 393 34
case 0 393 34
Kim 0 393 34
didn’t 0 393 34
remember 0 393 34
the 0 393 34
dire 0 393 34
fate 0 393 34
of 0 393 34
Iraq, 0 393 34

cheerfully 1 393 34
recalled 0 393 34
the 0 393 34
doom 1 393 34
of 0 393 34
Libya’s 0 393 34
murdered 0 393 34

Khadaffi. 0 393 34

The 0 393 35
Singapore 0 393 35
summit 0 393 35
was 0 393 35
also 0 393 35
a 0 393 35
huge 1 393 35
humiliation 1 393 35
for 0 393 35
America’s 0 393 35

Japan 0 393 35

In 0 393 36
Asia, 0 393 36
preserving 0 393 36
‘face’ 0 393 36
is 0 393 36
essential. 0 393 36

Trump 0 393 37
completely 0 393 37
ignored 0 393 37
America’s 0 393 37
two 0 393 37
old 0 393 37
allies 0 393 37
after 0 393 37
his 0 393 37
meeting 0 393 37
with 0 393 37
Kim 0 393 37
– 0 393 37
who 0 393 37
routinely 0 393 37
blasts 0 393 37
Japan 0 393 37
and 0 393 37
South 0 393 37
Korea 0 393 37
as 0 393 37
‘America’s 1 393 37
stooges.’ 1 393 37
Instead, 0 393 37
Trump 0 393 37
sent 0 393 37
his 0 393 37
beginner 0 393 37
Secretary 0 393 37
of 0 393 37
State 0 393 37
Mike 0 393 37
Pompeo 0 393 37
to 0 393 37
explain 0 393 37
what 0 393 37
happened 0 393 37
in 0 393 37
Singapore, 0 393 37
inflicting 0 393 37
a 0 393 37
deep 0 393 37
loss 0 393 37
of 0 393 37
face 0 393 37
on 0 393 37
Tokyo 0 393 37
and 0 393 37
Seoul. 0 393 37

This 0 393 38
was 0 393 38
a 0 393 38
terrible 1 393 38
insult 1 393 38
and 0 393 38
could 0 393 38
spark 0 393 38
decisions 0 393 38
by 0 393 38
at 0 393 38
least 0 393 38
Japan 0 393 38
to 0 393 38
proceed 0 393 38
ahead 0 393 38
with 0 393 38
its 0 393 38
covert 0 393 38
nuclear 0 393 38
program. 0 393 38

Japan 0 393 39
can 0 393 39
deploy 0 393 39
nuclear 0 393 39
weapons 0 393 39
in 0 393 39
3-6 0 393 39
months; 0 393 39
South 0 393 39
Korea 0 393 39
is 0 393 39
not 0 393 39
far 0 393 39
behind. 0 393 39

The 0 393 40
United 0 393 40
States 0 393 40
and 0 393 40
North 0 393 40
Korea 0 393 40
are 0 393 40
now 0 393 40
on 0 393 40
a 0 393 40
more 0 393 40
civilized 0 393 40
level 0 393 40
of 0 393 40
behavior. 0 393 40

But 0 393 41
nothing 0 393 41
basic 0 393 41
has 0 393 41
been 0 393 41
resolved. 0 393 41

Maybe 0 393 42
Trump 0 393 42
has 0 393 42
some 0 393 42
more 0 393 42
concessions 0 393 42
up 0 393 42
his 0 393 42

a 0 394 1
new 0 394 1
congressional 0 394 1
investigation.” 0 394 1

And 0 394 2
it 0 394 2
gets 0 394 2
even 1 394 2
worse: 1 394 2
“The 0 394 2
investigation, 0 394 2
published 0 394 2
Wednesday 0 394 2
by 0 394 2
the 0 394 2
House 0 394 2
Permanent 0 394 2
Subcommittee 0 394 2
on 0 394 2
Investigations, 0 394 2
further 0 394 2
discloses 0 394 2
secret 0 394 2
efforts 0 394 2
by 0 394 2
top 0 394 2
Obama 0 394 2
administration 0 394 2

to 0 394 2
assure 0 394 2
European 0 394 2
countries 0 394 2
they 0 394 2

in 0 394 2

with 0 394 2
Iran.” 0 394 2

This 0 394 3
revelation 0 394 3
comes 0 394 3
after 0 394 3
the 0 394 3
news 0 394 3
that 0 394 3
came 0 394 3
to 0 394 3
light 0 394 3
in 0 394 3
February, 0 394 3
that, 0 394 3
according 0 394 3
to 0 394 3
Bill 0 394 3
Gertz 0 394 3
in 0 394 3
the 0 394 3
Washington 0 394 3
Times, 0 394 3
“the 0 394 3
U.S. 0 394 3

transferred.” 0 394 3

There 0 394 4
is 0 394 4
a 0 394 4
law 0 394 4
that 0 394 4
applies 0 394 4
to 0 394 4
this 0 394 4
situation. 0 394 4

U.S. 0 394 5
Code 0 394 5
2381 0 394 5

“Whoever, 0 394 5

In 0 394 6
a 0 394 6
sane 0 394 6
political 0 394 6
environment, 0 394 6
Barack 0 394 6
Obama 0 394 6
would 0 394 6
be 0 394 6
tried 0 394 6
for 0 394 6
treason. 1 394 6

Barack 0 394 7
Hussein 0 394 7
Obama 0 394 7
has 0 394 7
planted 0 394 7
seeds 0 394 7
that 0 394 7
will 0 394 7
be 0 394 7
bearing 0 394 7
bitter 0 394 7
fruit 0 394 7
for 1 394 7
years, 1 394 7
and 1 394 7
probably 1 394 7
decades, 1 394 7
to 0 394 7
come. 0 394 7

He 0 394 8
is, 0 394 8
without 0 394 8
any 0 394 8
doubt, 0 394 8
the 1 394 8
worst 1 394 8
President 0 394 8
in 0 394 8
American 0 394 8
history. 0 394 8

Fillmore, 0 394 9
Pierce, 0 394 9
Buchanan? 0 394 9

Yes, 0 394 10
the 0 394 10
doughface 0 394 10
Presidents 0 394 10
made 0 394 10
the 0 394 10
Civil 0 394 10
War 0 394 10
inevitable, 0 394 10
but 0 394 10
worse 0 394 10
came 0 394 10
later. 0 394 10

Grant? 0 394 11

Blind 1 394 12
to 1 394 12
corruption 1 394 12
and 0 394 12
out 0 394 12
of 0 394 12
his 0 394 12
depth, 0 394 12
but 0 394 12
there 0 394 12
have 0 394 12
been 0 394 12
worse 0 394 12
than 0 394 12
he 0 394 12
as 0 394 12
well. 0 394 12

Wilson? 0 394 13

That 0 394 14
black-hearted 1 394 14
Presbyterian 1 394 14
bigot 1 394 14
arguably 0 394 14
gave 0 394 14
the 0 394 14
world 0 394 14
Hitler 0 394 14
and 0 394 14
World 0 394 14
War 0 394 14
II, 0 394 14
so 0 394 14
he 0 394 14
is 0 394 14
definitely 0 394 14
in 0 394 14
the 0 394 14
Final 0 394 14
Four. 0 394 14

Harding? 0 394 15

Nah: 0 394 16
his 0 394 16
tax 0 394 16
cuts 0 394 16
and 0 394 16
return 0 394 16
to 0 394 16
“normalcy” 0 394 16
got 0 394 16
the 0 394 16
American 0 394 16
economy, 0 394 16
and 0 394 16
the 0 394 16
Twenties, 0 394 16
roaring. 0 394 16

FDR 0 394 17
and 0 394 17
LBJ 0 394 17
gave 0 394 17
us 0 394 17
the 0 394 17
modern 0 394 17
welfare 0 394 17
state 0 394 17
and 0 394 17
dependent 0 394 17
classes 0 394 17
automatically 0 394 17
voting 0 394 17
Democrat; 0 394 17
the 0 394 17
full 0 394 17
bill 0 394 17
on 0 394 17
the 0 394 17
damage 0 394 17
they 0 394 17
did 0 394 17
hasn’t 0 394 17
yet 0 394 17
been 0 394 17
presented. 0 394 17

Nixon? 0 394 18

A 0 394 19
crook 1 394 19
and 1 394 19
an 1 394 19
economic 1 394 19
Leftist, 1 394 19
who 0 394 19
betrayed 0 394 19
Taiwan 0 394 19
for 0 394 19
the 0 394 19
People’s 0 394 19
Republic; 0 394 19
his 0 394 19
record 0 394 19
certainly 0 394 19
isn’t 0 394 19
good. 0 394 19

Carter? 0 394 20

Nothing 1 394 21
good 1 394 21
can 0 394 21
be 0 394 21
said 0 394 21
about 0 394 21
his 0 394 21
four 0 394 21
years 0 394 21
of 0 394 21
sanctimony 0 394 21
and 0 394 21
incompetence. 0 394 21

But 0 394 22
there 0 394 22
is 0 394 22
one 0 394 22
thing 0 394 22
Barack 0 394 22
Obama 0 394 22
has 0 394 22
on 0 394 22
all 0 394 22
competitors: 0 394 22
treason. 1 394 22

He 0 394 23
showered 0 394 23
hundreds 0 394 23
of 0 394 23
billions 0 394 23
of 0 394 23
dollars 0 394 23
on 0 394 23
the 0 394 23
Islamic 0 394 23
Republic 0 394 23
of 0 394 23
Iran. 0 394 23

There 0 394 24
are 0 394 24
those 0 394 24
who 0 394 24
say, 0 394 24
“It 0 394 24
was 0 394 24
their 0 394 24
money. 0 394 24

It 0 394 25
belonged 0 394 25
to 0 394 25
the 0 394 25
Iranian 0 394 25
government 0 394 25
but 0 394 25
was 0 394 25
frozen 0 394 25
and 0 394 25
not 0 394 25
paid 0 394 25
since 0 394 25
1979.” 0 394 25
Indeed, 0 394 25
and 0 394 25
there 0 394 25
was 0 394 25
a 0 394 25
reason 0 394 25
for 0 394 25
that: 0 394 25
not 0 394 25
even 0 394 25
Jimmy 0 394 25
Carter, 0 394 25
who 0 394 25
made 0 394 25
the 0 394 25
Islamic 0 394 25
Republic 0 394 25
of 0 394 25
Iran 0 394 25
possible, 0 394 25
thought 0 394 25
that 0 394 25
money, 0 394 25
which 0 394 25
had 0 394 25
been 0 394 25
paid 0 394 25
by 0 394 25
the 0 394 25
Shah’s 0 394 25
government 0 394 25
in 0 394 25
a 0 394 25
canceled 0 394 25
arms 0 394 25
deal, 0 394 25
belonged 0 394 25
to 0 394 25
the 0 394 25
mullahs 0 394 25
who 0 394 25
overthrew 0 394 25
the 0 394 25
Shah. 0 394 25

Likewise 0 394 26
Reagan, 0 394 26
George 0 394 26
H. 0 394 26
W. 0 394 26
Bush, 0 394 26
Clinton, 0 394 26
and 0 394 26
George 0 394 26
W. 0 394 26
Bush 0 394 26
all 0 394 26
thought 0 394 26
that 0 394 26
the 0 394 26
Islamic 0 394 26
Republic 0 394 26
was 0 394 26
not 0 394 26
due 0 394 26
money 0 394 26
that 0 394 26
was 0 394 26
owed 0 394 26
to 0 394 26
the 0 394 26
Shah. 0 394 26

Only 0 394 27
Barack 0 394 27
Obama 0 394 27
did. 0 394 27

The 0 394 28
definition 0 394 28
of 0 394 28
treason 1 394 28
is 0 394 28
giving 0 394 28
aid 0 394 28
and 0 394 28
comfort 0 394 28
to 0 394 28
the 0 394 28
enemy. 0 394 28

The 0 394 29
leaders 0 394 29
of 0 394 29
the 0 394 29
Islamic 0 394 29
Republic 0 394 29
of 0 394 29
Iran 0 394 29
order 0 394 29
their 0 394 29
people 0 394 29
to 0 394 29
chant 0 394 29
“Death 1 394 29
to 1 394 29
America” 1 394 29
in 0 394 29
mosques 0 394 29
every 0 394 29
Friday, 0 394 29
and 0 394 29
repeatedly 0 394 29
vow 0 394 29
that 0 394 29
they 0 394 29
will 0 394 29
ultimately 0 394 29
destroy 0 394 29
the 0 394 29
United 0 394 29
States 0 394 29
of 0 394 29
America 0 394 29
and 0 394 29
the 0 394 29
state 0 394 29
of 0 394 29
Israel. 0 394 29

How 0 394 30
was 0 394 30
giving 0 394 30
them 0 394 30
billions 0 394 30
and 0 394 30
helping 0 394 30
them 0 394 30
skirt 0 394 30
sanctions 0 394 30
applied 0 394 30
by 0 394 30
the 0 394 30
U.S. 0 394 30
government 0 394 30
not 0 394 30
treason? 1 394 30

Other 0 394 31
Presidents 0 394 31
have 0 394 31
been 0 394 31
incompetent, 1 394 31
corrupt, 1 394 31
dishonest, 1 394 31
but 0 394 31
which 0 394 31
has 0 394 31
committed 0 394 31
treason 1 394 31
on 0 394 31
a 0 394 31
scale 0 394 31
to 0 394 31
rival 0 394 31
the 0 394 31
treason 1 394 31
of 0 394 31
Barack 0 394 31
Obama? 0 394 31

The 0 394 32
Iranians 0 394 32
also 0 394 32
operate 0 394 32
a 0 394 32
global 0 394 32
network 0 394 32
of 0 394 32
jihad 0 394 32
terror 0 394 32
organizations, 0 394 32
one 0 394 32
of 0 394 32
which, 0 394 32
Hizballah, 0 394 32
is 0 394 32
quite 0 394 32
active 0 394 32
in 0 394 32
Mexico 0 394 32
now, 0 394 32
with 0 394 32
the 0 394 32
obvious 0 394 32
ultimate 0 394 32
intention 0 394 32
of 0 394 32
crossing 0 394 32
the 0 394 32
border 0 394 32
and 0 394 32
committing 1 394 32
jihad 1 394 32
massacres 1 394 32
of 1 394 32
Americans. 1 394 32

Obama 0 394 33
has 0 394 33
given 0 394 33
a 0 394 33
tremendous 1 394 33
boost 0 394 33
to 0 394 33
these 0 394 33
initiatives, 0 394 33
as 0 394 33
well 0 394 33
as 0 394 33
to 0 394 33
Iran’s 0 394 33
nuclear 0 394 33
program, 0 394 33
with 0 394 33
his 0 394 33
nuclear 0 394 33
deal 0 394 33
that 0 394 33
has 0 394 33
given 0 394 33
the 0 394 33
Iranians 0 394 33
hundreds 0 394 33
of 0 394 33
billions 0 394 33
of 0 394 33
dollars 0 394 33
and 0 394 33
essentially 0 394 33
a 0 394 33
green 0 394 33
light 0 394 33
to 0 394 33
manufacture 0 394 33
nuclear 0 394 33
weapons, 0 394 33
in 0 394 33
exchange 0 394 33
for 0 394 33
absolutely 0 394 33
nothing. 0 394 33

There 0 394 34
is 0 394 34
no 0 394 34
telling 0 394 34
when 0 394 34
the 0 394 34
worst 0 394 34
consequences 0 394 34
of 0 394 34
Obama’s 0 394 34
aid 0 394 34
and 0 394 34
comfort 0 394 34
to 0 394 34
the 0 394 34
Islamic 0 394 34
Republic 0 394 34
of 0 394 34
Iran 0 394 34
will 0 394 34
be 0 394 34
felt. 0 394 34

But 0 394 35
they 0 394 35
likely 0 394 35
will 0 394 35
be 0 394 35
felt 0 394 35
in 0 394 35
one 0 394 35
way 0 394 35
or 0 394 35
another. 0 394 35

Even 0 394 36
as 0 394 36
President 0 394 36
Trump 0 394 36
moves 0 394 36
swiftly 0 394 36

this 0 394 37

It’s 0 394 39

however, 0 395 5
said 0 395 5
he 0 395 5
understood 0 395 5
why 0 395 5
the 0 395 5
students 0 395 5

not 0 395 6
determine 0 395 6
if 0 395 6
the 0 395 6
vote 0 395 6
was 0 395 6
motivated 0 395 6
by 0 395 6
anti-Semitism, 0 395 6
but 0 395 6
he 0 395 6
acknowledged 0 395 6
there 0 395 6
were 0 395 6

with 0 395 7

clarification. 0 395 7

“I 0 395 8
thought 0 395 8

I 0 395 8
really 0 395 8

he 0 395 13
feels 0 395 13
vindicated 0 395 13

just 0 396 4
how 0 396 4

around 0 396 5

Yeah, 1 396 6
it’s 1 396 6

roughly 0 396 13
10 0 396 13

that 0 396 13

increasingly 0 397 7
at 0 397 7
odds 0 397 7
politically 0 397 7
and 0 397 7
economically 0 397 7
with 0 397 7
mainstream 0 397 7
European 0 397 7
Union 0 397 7
peers, 0 397 7
Orban 0 397 7
has 0 397 7
thrived 0 397 7
on 0 397 7
external 0 397 7

conflicts, 0 397 8
mostly 0 397 8
centered 0 397 8
on 0 397 8

of 1 397 8

One 0 397 9
thing 0 397 9
to 0 397 9
note 0 397 9
is 0 397 9
that 0 397 9
Christianity 1 397 9
is 1 397 9
not 1 397 9
Europe's 1 397 9
"last 1 397 9

it's 1 397 9
the 1 397 9
world's 1 397 9
"only 1 397 9
hope." 1 397 9

In 0 397 10
speaking 0 397 10
of 0 397 10

influx 0 397 10
of 0 397 10
Muslim 0 397 10
migrants 0 397 10
into 0 397 10
Europe, 0 397 10
Orban 0 397 10
sees 0 397 10
it 0 397 10
as 0 397 10
destroying 0 397 10
the 0 397 10
culture 0 397 10
of 0 397 10
Europe 0 397 10
and 0 397 10
referred 0 397 10
to 0 397 10
it 0 397 10
as 0 397 10
an 0 397 10
“immigrant 0 397 10
zone, 0 397 10

different 1 397 10
from 1 397 10

Orban 0 397 11
then 0 397 11
called 0 397 11
out 0 397 11
the 1 397 11
traitors 1 397 11
in 0 397 11
the 0 397 11
midst 0 397 11
of 0 397 11

who 0 397 11
want 0 397 11
to 0 397 11

“The 0 397 26

the 0 403 13
agonizing 1 403 13

hit 0 403 13
him 0 403 13
again; 0 403 13
as 0 403 13
if, 0 403 13
he 0 403 13
told 0 403 13

he 0 403 13

the 0 403 14
consequences 0 403 14
have 0 403 14
been 0 403 14
unmistakable 0 403 14

symptoms 0 403 14
ranging 0 403 14
from 0 403 14

Note 0 404 14
the 0 404 14
following 0 404 14
excerpt: 0 404 14

For 0 404 15
secret 0 404 15
assassination, 0 404 15
either 0 404 15
simple 0 404 15
or 0 404 15
chase, 0 404 15
the 0 404 15
contrived 0 404 15
accident 0 404 15
is 0 404 15
the 0 404 15
most 0 404 15
effective 0 404 15
technique. 0 404 15

When 0 404 16
successfully 0 404 16
executed, 0 404 16
it 0 404 16
causes 0 404 16
little 0 404 16
excitement 0 404 16
and 0 404 16
is 0 404 16
only 0 404 16
casually 0 404 16
investigated. 0 404 16

It 0 404 17
would 0 404 17
be 0 404 17
safe 0 404 17
to 0 404 17
assume 0 404 17
that 0 404 17
the 0 404 17
CIA 0 404 17
continued 0 404 17
developing 0 404 17
and 0 404 17
expanding 0 404 17

the 0 404 17
assassination 0 404 17
principles 0 404 17
enunciated 0 404 17
in 0 404 17
that 0 404 17
early 0 404 17
assassination 0 404 17
manual. 0 404 17

That’s 0 404 18
what 0 404 18
we 0 404 18
would 0 404 18
expect 0 404 18
from 0 404 18

We 0 404 19
can 0 404 19
also 0 404 19
assume 0 404 19
that 0 404 19
the 0 404 19
CIA 0 404 19

in 0 404 21

one 0 404 21
that 0 404 21

right-wing, 1 404 21
pro-U.S. 1 404 21
military 1 404 21

As 0 404 22
part 0 404 22
of 0 404 22
the 0 404 22
Guatemala 0 404 22
regime-change 0 404 22
operation, 0 404 22
the 0 404 22
CIA 0 404 22
prepared 0 404 22
a 0 404 22
list 0 404 22
of 0 404 22
Guatemalan 0 404 22
officials 0 404 22
to 0 404 22
be 0 404 22
assassinated. 0 404 22

While 0 404 23
the 0 404 23
CIA 0 404 23
has 0 404 23
never 0 404 23
revealed 0 404 23
the 0 404 23
names 0 404 23
of 0 404 23
the 0 404 23
people 0 404 23
it 0 404 23
targeted 0 404 23
for 0 404 23
assassination, 0 404 23
there 0 404 23
is 0 404 23
little 0 404 23
doubt 0 404 23
that 0 404 23
Arbenz, 0 404 23
the 0 404 23
president, 0 404 23
was 0 404 23
at 0 404 23
the 0 404 23
top 0 404 23
of 0 404 23
the 0 404 23
list. 0 404 23

There 0 404 24
is 0 404 24
something 0 404 24
important 0 404 24
to 0 404 24
note: 0 404 24
Neither 0 404 24
Arbenz 0 404 24
nor 0 404 24
any 0 404 24
other 0 404 24
Guatemalan 0 404 24
official 0 404 24
had 0 404 24
ever 0 404 24

even 0 404 24
threatened 0 404 24
to 0 404 24

so. 0 404 24

So, 0 404 25
why 0 404 25
were 0 404 25
they 0 404 25
targeted 0 404 25
for 0 404 25
assassination? 0 404 25

Because 0 404 26
Arbenz 0 404 26
had 0 404 26
reached 0 404 26
out 0 404 26
to 0 404 26
the 0 404 26
Russians 0 404 26
and 0 404 26
Cubans 0 404 26
in 0 404 26
a 0 404 26
spirit 0 404 26
of 0 404 26
peace 0 404 26
and 0 404 26
friendship, 0 404 26
just 0 404 26
as 0 404 26
John 0 404 26
Kennedy 0 404 26
would 0 404 26
do 0 404 26
ten 0 404 26
years 0 404 26
later. 0 404 26

That’s 0 404 27
why 0 404 27
the 0 404 27
CIA 0 404 27
targeted 0 404 27
Guatemala 0 404 27
for 0 404 27
regime 0 404 27
change 0 404 27
and 0 404 27
why 0 404 27
it 0 404 27
targeted 0 404 27
Arbenz 0 404 27
and 0 404 27
other 0 404 27
Guatemalan 0 404 27
officials 0 404 27
for 0 404 27
assassination. 0 404 27

Although 0 404 28
Arbenz 0 404 28
was 0 404 28
able 0 404 28
to 0 404 28
escape 0 404 28
the 0 404 28
country, 0 404 28
the 0 404 28
CIA’s 0 404 28
regime-change 0 404 28
operation 0 404 28
was 0 404 28
a 1 404 28
total 1 404 28
success, 1 404 28
with 0 404 28
Arbenz 0 404 28
being 0 404 28
replaced 0 404 28
by 0 404 28
the 0 404 28
pro-U.S. 0 404 28
Gen. 0 404 28
Carlos 0 404 28
Castillo 0 404 28
Armas, 0 404 28
who 0 404 28
proceeded 0 404 28
to 0 404 28
instigate 0 404 28
a 1 404 28
reign 1 404 28
of 1 404 28
terror 1 404 28
across 0 404 28
Guatemala. 0 404 28

The 1 404 29
Guatemalan 1 404 29
operation 1 404 29
was 1 404 29
brilliant 1 404 29
and 1 404 29
ingenious. 1 404 29

The 0 404 30
CIA 0 404 30
officials 0 404 30
were 0 404 30
secretly 0 404 30
honored 0 404 30
for 0 404 30
protecting 0 404 30
“national 0 404 30
security” 0 404 30
by 0 404 30
removing 0 404 30
President 0 404 30
Arbenz 0 404 30
from 0 404 30
office 0 404 30
and 0 404 30
replacing 0 404 30
him 0 404 30
with 0 404 30
a 0 404 30
pro-U.S. 0 404 30
military 0 404 30
general. 0 404 30

Tracy 0 404 31
Barnes, 0 404 31
one 0 404 31
of 0 404 31
the 0 404 31
CIA 0 404 31
officials 0 404 31
responsible 0 404 31
for 0 404 31
the 0 404 31
operation, 0 404 31
was 0 404 31
awarded 0 404 31
the 0 404 31
Distinguished 0 404 31
Intelligence 0 404 31
Medal, 0 404 31
the 0 404 31
CIA’s 0 404 31
second-highest 0 404 31
medal. 0 404 31

The 1 404 32
CIA’s 1 404 32
cover-up 1 404 32
in 1 404 32
the 1 404 32
JFK 1 404 32
assassination 1 404 32
was 1 404 32
even 1 404 32
more 1 404 32
brilliant 1 404 32
and 1 404 32
ingenious. 1 404 32

The 0 404 33
doctors 0 404 33
at 0 404 33
Parkland 0 404 33
Hospital 0 404 33
stated 0 404 33
that 0 404 33
President 0 404 33
Kennedy 0 404 33
had 0 404 33
a 0 404 33
big 0 404 33
exit-sized 0 404 33
wound 0 404 33
in 0 404 33
the 0 404 33
back 0 404 33
of 0 404 33
his 0 404 33
head, 0 404 33
which 0 404 33
implied 0 404 33
a 0 404 33
shot 0 404 33
having 0 404 33
been 0 404 33
fired 0 404 33
from 0 404 33
the 0 404 33
front. 0 404 33

At 0 404 34
a 0 404 34
press 0 404 34
conference 0 404 34
immediately 0 404 34
after 0 404 34
the 0 404 34
president 0 404 34
died, 0 404 34
two 0 404 34
treating 0 404 34
physicians 0 404 34
stated 0 404 34
that 0 404 34
the 0 404 34
other 0 404 34
wound 0 404 34
— 0 404 34
the 0 404 34
one 0 404 34
in 0 404 34
the 0 404 34
front 0 404 34
of 0 404 34
Kennedy’s 0 404 34
neck 0 404 34
— 0 404 34
was 0 404 34
an 0 404 34
entry 0 404 34
wound, 0 404 34
which 0 404 34
implied 0 404 34
that 0 404 34
Kennedy 0 404 34
had 0 404 34
been 0 404 34
hit 0 404 34
by 0 404 34
another 0 404 34
shot 0 404 34
fired 0 404 34
from 0 404 34
the 0 404 34
front. 0 404 34

This 0 404 35
necessarily 0 404 35
meant 0 404 35
that 0 404 35
Kennedy 0 404 35
had 0 404 35
been 0 404 35
shot 0 404 35
from 0 404 35
the 0 404 35
front, 0 404 35
not 0 404 35
the 0 404 35
rear, 0 404 35
where 0 404 35
accused 0 404 35
assassin 0 404 35
Lee 0 404 35
Harvey 0 404 35
Oswald 0 404 35
was 0 404 35
situated. 0 404 35

Keep 0 404 36
in 0 404 36
mind 0 404 36
something 0 404 36
important: 0 404 36
After 0 404 36
he 0 404 36
was 0 404 36
arrested, 0 404 36
Oswald 0 404 36
claimed 0 404 36
his 0 404 36
innocence. 0 404 36

But 0 404 37
he 0 404 37
also 0 404 37
went 0 404 37
a 0 404 37
step 0 404 37
further. 0 404 37

He 0 404 38
said 0 404 38
that 0 404 38
he 0 404 38
was 0 404 38
being 0 404 38
framed 0 404 38
for 0 404 38
the 0 404 38
crime. 0 404 38

The 0 404 39
obvious 0 404 39
question 0 404 39
arises: 0 404 39
Why 0 404 39
frame 0 404 39
an 0 404 39
innocent 0 404 39
man 0 404 39
who 0 404 39
is 0 404 39
situated 0 404 39
in 0 404 39
the 0 404 39
rear 0 404 39
by 0 404 39
killing 0 404 39
the 0 404 39
president 0 404 39
with 0 404 39
shots 0 404 39
fired 0 404 39
from 0 404 39
the 0 404 39
front? 0 404 39

Wouldn’t 0 404 40
it 0 404 40
be 0 404 40
more 0 404 40
logical 0 404 40
to 0 404 40
either 0 404 40
have 0 404 40
the 0 404 40
shots 0 404 40
fired 0 404 40
from 0 404 40
the 0 404 40
rear, 0 404 40
where 0 404 40
Oswald 0 404 40
was, 0 404 40
or, 0 404 40
alternatively, 0 404 40
place 0 404 40
Oswald 0 404 40
in 0 404 40
the 0 404 40
front, 0 404 40
where 0 404 40
the 0 404 40
shots 0 404 40
were 0 404 40
fired? 0 404 40

That’s 0 404 41
where 0 404 41
the 1 404 41
brilliance, 1 404 41
ingenuity, 1 404 41
and 1 404 41
cunningness 1 404 41
of 1 404 41
the 1 404 41
cover-up 1 404 41
come 0 404 41
into 0 404 41
play. 0 404 41

If 0 404 42
Oswald 0 404 42
is 0 404 42
in 0 404 42
the 0 404 42
rear 0 404 42
and 0 404 42
since 0 404 42
shots 0 404 42
are 0 404 42
fired 0 404 42
from 0 404 42
the 0 404 42
front, 0 404 42
that 0 404 42
could 0 404 42
mean 0 404 42
only 0 404 42
one 0 404 42
thing: 0 404 42
that 0 404 42
Oswald 0 404 42
had 0 404 42
confederates 0 404 42
firing 0 404 42
from 0 404 42
the 0 404 42
front. 0 404 42

Who 0 404 43
would 0 404 43
those 0 404 43
confederates 0 404 43
be? 0 404 43

There 1 404 44
could 1 404 44
be 1 404 44
only 1 404 44
one 1 404 44
answer: 1 404 44
communists. 1 404 44

Soviet 1 404 45
and 1 404 45
Cuban 1 404 45
communists, 1 404 45
to 1 404 45
be 1 404 45
more 1 404 45
specific. 1 404 45

How 0 404 46
would 0 404 46
we 0 404 46
know 0 404 46
this? 0 404 46

That’s 0 404 47
where 0 404 47
Oswald’s 0 404 47
trip 0 404 47
to 0 404 47
Mexico 0 404 47
City 0 404 47
right 0 404 47
before 0 404 47
the 0 404 47
assassination 0 404 47
comes 0 404 47
into 0 404 47
play. 0 404 47

Regime 0 404 48
Change: 0 404 48
The 0 404 48
JFK... 0 404 48

Oswald 0 404 49
traveled 0 404 49
to 0 404 49
Mexico 0 404 49
City 0 404 49
where 0 404 49
he 0 404 49
purportedly 0 404 49
visited 0 404 49
the 0 404 49
Soviet 0 404 49
and 0 404 49
Cuban 0 404 49
embassies 0 404 49
and 0 404 49
where 0 404 49
he 0 404 49
supposedly 0 404 49
met 0 404 49
with 0 404 49
a 0 404 49
premier 0 404 49
assassin 0 404 49
for 0 404 49
the 0 404 49
Soviet 0 404 49
Union. 0 404 49

Keep 0 404 50
in 0 404 50
mind 0 404 50
that 0 404 50
this 0 404 50
was 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
height 0 404 50
of 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
Cold 0 404 50
War 0 404 50
between 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
United 0 404 50
States 0 404 50
and 0 404 50
that 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
Cuban 0 404 50
Missile 0 404 50
Crisis, 0 404 50
which 0 404 50
brought 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
world 0 404 50
to 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
brink 0 404 50
of 0 404 50
nuclear 0 404 50
war, 0 404 50
had 0 404 50
taken 0 404 50
place 0 404 50
the 0 404 50
previous 0 404 50
year. 0 404 50

So, 0 404 51
President 0 404 51
Kennedy 0 404 51
has 0 404 51
been 0 404 51
assassinated. 0 404 51

Oswald 0 404 52
is 0 404 52
immediately 0 404 52
arrested. 0 404 52

He 0 404 53
has 0 404 53
confederates 0 404 53
firing 0 404 53
from 0 404 53
the 0 404 53
front, 0 404 53
who 1 404 53
almost 1 404 53
certainly 1 404 53
are 1 404 53
Soviet 1 404 53
and 1 404 53
Cuban 1 404 53
communists, 1 404 53
especially 0 404 53
since 0 404 53
Oswald 0 404 53
has 0 404 53
supposedly 0 404 53
just 0 404 53
recently 0 404 53
visited 0 404 53
the 0 404 53
Soviet 0 404 53
and 0 404 53
Cuban 0 404 53
embassies 0 404 53
in 0 404 53
Mexico 0 404 53
City. 0 404 53

What 0 404 54
does 0 404 54
all 0 404 54
that 0 404 54
mean? 0 404 54

An 0 404 55
assassination 0 404 55
of 0 404 55
the 0 404 55
president 0 404 55
by 0 404 55
the 0 404 55
Soviet 0 404 55
Union 0 404 55
and 0 404 55
Cuba 0 404 55
is 0 404 55
obviously 0 404 55
an 0 404 55
act 0 404 55
of 0 404 55
war. 0 404 55

That 0 404 56
means 0 404 56
nuclear 0 404 56
war 0 404 56
is 0 404 56
about 0 404 56
to 0 404 56
break 0 404 56
out 0 404 56
because 0 404 56
there 0 404 56
is 0 404 56
no 0 404 56
way 0 404 56
that 0 404 56
the 0 404 56
United 0 404 56
States 0 404 56
is 0 404 56
going 0 404 56
to 0 404 56
sit 0 404 56
idly 0 404 56
by 0 404 56
when 0 404 56
the 1 404 56
Reds 1 404 56
have 0 404 56
just 0 404 56
assassinated 0 404 56
America’s 0 404 56
president. 0 404 56

Except 0 404 57
for 0 404 57
one 0 404 57
thing: 0 404 57
The 1 404 57
communist 1 404 57
part 1 404 57
and 1 404 57
the 1 404 57
nuclear-war 1 404 57
part 1 404 57
were 1 404 57
concocted. 1 404 57

That 1 404 58
was 1 404 58
all 1 404 58
part 1 404 58
of 1 404 58
the 1 404 58
plan. 1 404 58

That 0 404 59
was 0 404 59
the 1 404 59
ingenious 1 404 59
way 1 404 59
that 0 404 59
the 0 404 59
CIA 0 404 59
was 0 404 59
able 0 404 59
to 0 404 59
get 0 404 59
the 0 404 59
investigation 0 404 59
into 0 404 59
the 0 404 59
assassination 0 404 59
squelched 0 404 59
just 0 404 59
as 0 404 59
soon 0 404 59
as 0 404 59
Oswald 0 404 59
was 0 404 59
murdered. 0 404 59

In 0 404 60
the 0 404 60
early 0 404 60
days 0 404 60
of 0 404 60
the 0 404 60
Warren 0 404 60
Commission, 0 404 60
commission 0 404 60
chairman 0 404 60
Earl 0 404 60
Warren 0 404 60
called 0 404 60
a 0 404 60
top-secret 0 404 60
meeting 0 404 60
of 0 404 60
the 0 404 60
commission. 0 404 60

Its 0 404 61
purpose 0 404 61
was 0 404 61
to 0 404 61
discuss 0 404 61
information 0 404 61
that 0 404 61
Warren 0 404 61
had 0 404 61
received 0 404 61
that 0 404 61
Oswald 0 404 61
was 0 404 61
actually 0 404 61
a 0 404 61
U.S. 0 404 61
intelligence 0 404 61
agent 0 404 61
or 0 404 61
an 0 404 61
informant 0 404 61
for 0 404 61
the 0 404 61
FBI 0 404 61
or 0 404 61
both. 0 404 61

How 0 404 62
did 0 404 62
Warren 0 404 62
resolve 0 404 62
this 0 404 62
troubling 0 404 62
issue? 0 404 62

He 0 404 63
simply 0 404 63
asked 0 404 63
the 0 404 63
heads 0 404 63
of 0 404 63
the 0 404 63
CIA 0 404 63
and 0 404 63
FBI 0 404 63
whether 0 404 63
it 0 404 63
was 0 404 63
true. 0 404 63

They 0 404 64
said 0 404 64
no. 0 404 64

That 0 404 65
was 0 404 65
the 0 404 65
end 0 404 65
of 0 404 65
the 0 404 65
matter. 0 404 65

The 0 404 66
issue 0 404 66
was 0 404 66
so 0 404 66
sensitive 0 404 66
that 0 404 66
Warren 0 404 66
ordered 0 404 66
the 0 404 66
members 0 404 66
of 0 404 66
the 0 404 66
commission 0 404 66
to 1 404 66
never 1 404 66
reveal 1 404 66
the 1 404 66
meeting 1 404 66
to 1 404 66
the 1 404 66
American 1 404 66
people. 1 404 66

He 0 404 67
ordered 0 404 67
all 0 404 67
notes 0 404 67
and 0 404 67
other 0 404 67
written 0 404 67
references 0 404 67
to 0 404 67
be 0 404 67
destroyed. 0 404 67

He 0 404 68
also 0 404 68
ordered 0 404 68
the 0 404 68
court 0 404 68
reporter 0 404 68
to 0 404 68
destroy 0 404 68
her 0 404 68
notes 0 404 68
of 0 404 68
the 0 404 68
meeting. 0 404 68

Unbeknownst 0 404 69
to 0 404 69
him, 0 404 69
the 0 404 69
court 0 404 69
reporter 0 404 69
inadvertently 0 404 69
kept 0 404 69
a 0 404 69
recording 0 404 69
of 0 404 69
the 0 404 69
meeting 0 404 69
that 0 404 69
ultimately 0 404 69
came 0 404 69
to 0 404 69
light. 0 404 69

This 0 404 70
troubling 0 404 70
issue 0 404 70
arose 0 404 70

HELMS: 0 404 80
Mr. 0 404 80
Belin, 0 404 80
this 0 404 80
question, 0 404 80
and 0 404 80
I 0 404 80
think 0 404 80
you 0 404 80
may 0 404 80
recall 0 404 80
this, 0 404 80
was 0 404 80
raised 0 404 80
at 0 404 80
the 0 404 80
time 0 404 80
and 0 404 80
the 0 404 80
Agency 0 404 80
was 0 404 80
never 0 404 80
able 0 404 80
to 0 404 80
find 0 404 80
any 0 404 80
evidence 0 404 80
whatsoever, 0 404 80
and 0 404 80
we 0 404 80
really 0 404 80
searched 0 404 80
that 0 404 80
it 0 404 80
had 0 404 80
any 0 404 80
contact 0 404 80
with 0 404 80
Lee 0 404 80
Harvey 0 404 80
Oswald. 0 404 80

As 0 404 81
far 0 404 81
as 0 404 81
the 0 404 81
FBI 0 404 81
was 0 404 81
concerned, 0 404 81
my 0 404 81
recollection 0 404 81
is 0 404 81
not 0 404 81
all 0 404 81
that 0 404 81
precise. 0 404 81

I 0 404 82
believe 0 404 82
that 0 404 82
Mr. 0 404 82
Hoover 0 404 82
testified 0 404 82
that 0 404 82
he 0 404 82
had 0 404 82
not 0 404 82
been 0 404 82
an 0 404 82
agent 0 404 82
of 0 404 82
theirs 0 404 82
either. 0 404 82

He 0 404 83
was 0 404 83
certainly 0 404 83
not 0 404 83
an 0 404 83
agent 0 404 83
of 0 404 83
the 0 404 83
CIA. 0 404 83

He 0 404 84
was 0 404 84
certainly 0 404 84
never 0 404 84
used 0 404 84
by 0 404 84
the 0 404 84
CIA. 0 404 84

Whether 0 404 85
any 0 404 85
CIA 0 404 85
officer 0 404 85
ever 0 404 85
talked 0 404 85
to 0 404 85
him 0 404 85
any 0 404 85
place 0 404 85
or 0 404 85
not 0 404 85
I 0 404 85
don’t 0 404 85
know 0 404 85
but 0 404 85
I 0 404 85
certainly 0 404 85
felt 0 404 85
quite 0 404 85
comfortable 0 404 85
— 0 404 85
I 0 404 85
believe 0 404 85
Mr. 0 404 85
[John] 0 404 85
McCone 0 404 85
[a 0 404 85
previous 0 404 85
CIA 0 404 85
director] 0 404 85
was 0 404 85
asked 0 404 85
to 0 404 85
testify 0 404 85
before 0 404 85
the 0 404 85
Commission 0 404 85
on 0 404 85
this 0 404 85
point. 0 404 85

I 0 404 86
believe 0 404 86
he 0 404 86
was 0 404 86
asked 0 404 86
to 0 404 86
testify. 0 404 86

It 0 404 87
was 0 404 87
a 0 404 87
hot 0 404 87
item 0 404 87
anyway 0 404 87
at 0 404 87
the 0 404 87
time. 0 404 87

And 0 404 88
my 0 404 88
recollection 0 404 88
is 0 404 88
that 0 404 88
I 0 404 88
informed 0 404 88
Mr. 0 404 88
McCone 0 404 88
that 0 404 88
we 0 404 88
could 0 404 88
find 0 404 88
no 0 404 88
evidence 0 404 88
that 0 404 88
Oswald 0 404 88
had 0 404 88
any 0 404 88
connection 0 404 88
with 0 404 88
the 0 404 88
CIA. 0 404 88

Shapira 0 404 89
ends 0 404 89
his 0 404 89
article 0 404 89
by 0 404 89
suggesting 0 404 89
that 0 404 89
commentators 1 404 89
should 1 404 89
do 1 404 89
more 1 404 89
complete 1 404 89
research, 1 404 89
maybe 1 404 89
even 1 404 89
use 1 404 89
Google, 1 404 89
before 1 404 89
they 1 404 89
jump 1 404 89
to 1 404 89
conclusions. 1 404 89

But 1 404 90
Shapira 1 404 90
would 1 404 90
be 1 404 90
wise 1 404 90
to 1 404 90
follow 1 404 90
his 1 404 90
own 1 404 90
advice 1 404 90
because 1 404 90
he 1 404 90
himself 1 404 90
is 1 404 90
guilty 1 404 90
of 1 404 90
what 1 404 90
he 1 404 90
accuses 1 404 90
others 1 404 90
of. 1 404 90

That’s 0 404 91
because 0 404 91
he 1 404 91
failed 1 404 91
to 1 404 91
conclude 1 404 91
his 1 404 91
article 1 404 91
with 1 404 91
one 1 404 91
great 1 404 91
big 1 404 91
important 1 404 91
point 1 404 91
about 1 404 91
former 1 404 91
CIA 1 404 91
Director 1 404 91
Richard 1 404 91
Helms. 1 404 91

What 0 404 92
is 0 404 92
that 0 404 92
great 1 404 92
big 1 404 92
important 1 404 92
point 1 404 92
that 0 404 92
Shapira, 0 404 92

to 1 404 92

Thus, 0 404 102
given 0 404 102
that 0 404 102

The 0 404 105
circumstantial 0 404 105

overwhelmingly 1 404 105
establishes 0 404 105
that 0 404 105
Oswald 0 404 105
was 0 404 105
working 0 404 105
for 0 404 105
U.S. 0 404 105

How 0 404 106
often 0 404 106
have 0 404 106
you 0 404 106

If 0 404 107
Oswald 0 404 107
was 0 404 107
a 0 404 107
genuine 0 404 107
communist, 0 404 107
why 0 404 107
would 0 404 107
he 0 404 107
have 0 404 107
joined 0 404 107
the 0 404 107
Marines 0 404 107
in 0 404 107
the 0 404 107
1950s, 0 404 107
given 0 404 107
that 0 404 107
the 0 404 107
Marines 0 404 107
hated 0 404 107
communists 0 404 107
and 0 404 107
had 0 404 107
just 0 404 107
helped 0 404 107

the 0 404 107

Why 0 404 108
would 0 404 108
a 0 404 108
genuine 0 404 108
communist 0 404 108
want 0 404 108
to 0 404 108

the 0 404 109

the 0 404 110

all 0 404 110

about 0 404 110
in 0 404 110
the 0 404 110

would 0 404 110

agree 0 404 110

him 0 404 110

country, 0 404 110

with 0 404 110
a 0 404 110
communist 1 404 110

Why 0 404 111
wouldn’t 0 404 111
they 0 404 111
indict 0 404 111
him 0 404 111
or 0 404 111
at 0 404 111

haul 0 404 111
him 0 404 111
before 0 404 111

as 0 404 111
to 0 404 111
what 0 404 111
secrets 0 404 111
he 0 404 111
gave 0 404 111
the 0 404 111
Russians? 0 404 111

Why 0 404 112
wouldn’t 0 404 112
they 0 404 112
harass, 1 404 112
abuse, 1 404 112
humiliate, 1 404 112
persecute, 1 404 112
or 1 404 112
prosecute 1 404 112
him, 1 404 112
like 0 404 112
they 0 404 112
did 0 404 112

have 0 404 112
deemed 0 404 112
to 0 404 112
be 0 404 112
communists 0 404 112
or 0 404 112
traitors? 0 404 112

How 0 404 113
is 0 404 113
it 0 404 113
possible 0 404 113
that 0 404 113
Oswald 0 404 113
could 0 404 113
learn 0 404 113
fluent 0 404 113
Russian 0 404 113
while 0 404 113

How 0 404 114
is 0 404 114
it 0 404 114
possible 0 404 114
that 0 404 114
a 0 404 114
veteran 0 404 114
who 0 404 114
embarrasses 0 404 114

to 0 404 114
saunter 0 404 114
across 0 404 114
the 0 404 114
Cold 0 404 114
War 0 404 114
stage 0 404 114
of 0 404 114
history, 0 404 114
not 0 404 114
long 0 404 114
after 0 404 114
the 0 404 114
McCarthy 0 404 114

without 1 404 114
nary 1 404 114
a 1 404 114
care 1 404 114
in 1 404 114
the 1 404 114
world? 1 404 114

The 1 404 115
answer: 1 404 115
Helms 1 404 115
lied. 1 404 115

There 1 404 116
is 1 404 116
no 1 404 116
reasonable 1 404 116
doubt 1 404 116
that 1 404 116
Oswald 1 404 116
was 1 404 116
a 1 404 116
U.S. 1 404 116
intelligence 1 404 116
agent, 1 404 116
one 0 404 116
who 0 404 116
was 0 404 116
ordered 0 404 116
to 0 404 116
travel 0 404 116
to 0 404 116
Mexico 0 404 116
City 0 404 116
to 0 404 116
set 0 404 116
the 0 404 116
framework 0 404 116
for 0 404 116
his 0 404 116
frame-up. 0 404 116

But 0 404 117
things 0 404 117
obviously 0 404 117
went 0 404 117
dreadfully 1 404 117
wrong 1 404 117
in 0 404 117
Mexico 0 404 117
City, 0 404 117
which 0 404 117
is 0 404 117
why 0 404 117
the 0 404 117
CIA 0 404 117
had 0 404 117
to 0 404 117
shut 0 404 117
down 0 404 117
that 0 404 117
part 0 404 117
of 0 404 117
the 0 404 117
post-assassination 0 404 117
investigation. 0 404 117

Not 0 404 118
surprisingly, 0 404 118
the 0 404 118
CIA’s 0 404 118
Mexico 0 404 118
City 0 404 118
operations 0 404 118
regarding 0 404 118
Oswald 0 404 118
are 0 404 118
among 0 404 118
the 0 404 118
98 0 404 118
percent 0 404 118
of 0 404 118
the 0 404 118
records 0 404 118
that 0 404 118
Trump 0 404 118
and 0 404 118
the 0 404 118
CIA 0 404 118
have 0 404 118
chosen 0 404 118
to 0 404 118
continue 0 404 118
keeping 1 404 118
secret 1 404 118
from 1 404 118
the 1 404 118
American 1 404 118
people, 1 404 118
on 0 404 118
grounds 0 404 118
of 0 404 118
“national 0 404 118
security” 0 404 118
of 0 404 118
course. 0 404 118

Thus, 0 404 119
when 1 404 119
Oswald 1 404 119
was 1 404 119
claiming 1 404 119
that 1 404 119
he 1 404 119
was 1 404 119
being 1 404 119
framed, 1 404 119
there 1 404 119
could 1 404 119
be 1 404 119
only 1 404 119
one 1 404 119
entity 1 404 119
that 1 404 119
he 1 404 119
could 1 404 119
have 1 404 119
been 1 404 119
thinking 1 404 119
about: 1 404 119
the 1 404 119
CIA, 1 404 119
the 0 404 119
agency 0 404 119
whose 0 404 119
officials, 0 404 119

secretly 1 404 119
monitoring 1 404 119

activities 1 404 119
in 1 404 119
the 1 404 119
weeks 1 404 119
leading 1 404 119
up 1 404 119
to 1 404 119
the 1 404 119
assassination, 1 404 119
no 1 404 119
doubt 1 404 119
to 1 404 119
ensure 1 404 119
that 1 404 119
Oswald 1 404 119
had 1 404 119
not 1 404 119
figured 1 404 119
out 1 404 119
what 1 404 119
was 1 404 119
about 1 404 119
to 1 404 119
happen 1 404 119
to 1 404 119
him. 1 404 119

We 0 404 120
can 0 404 120
assume 0 404 120
that 0 404 120
any 0 404 120
frame-up 0 404 120
by 0 404 120
the 0 404 120
CIA 0 404 120
is 0 404 120
going 0 404 120
to 0 404 120
be 0 404 120
good. 0 404 120

The 0 404 121
operation 0 404 121
is 0 404 121
going 0 404 121
to 0 404 121
be 0 404 121
carefully 0 404 121
planned 0 404 121
and 0 404 121
executed. 0 404 121

But 1 404 122
no 1 404 122
plan 1 404 122
is 1 404 122
perfect. 1 404 122

Things 0 404 123
are 0 404 123
inevitably 0 404 123
going 0 404 123
to 0 404 123
go 0 404 123
wrong. 0 404 123

The 0 404 124
pieces 0 404 124
aren’t 0 404 124
going 0 404 124
to 0 404 124
fit 0 404 124
together 0 404 124
perfectly. 0 404 124

The 0 404 125
Mexico 0 404 125
City 0 404 125
operation 0 404 125
is 0 404 125
a 0 404 125
good 0 404 125
example 0 404 125
of 0 404 125
that. 0 404 125

That’s 1 404 126
why 1 404 126
the 1 404 126
CIA 1 404 126
has 1 404 126
to 1 404 126
continue 1 404 126
keeping 1 404 126
those 1 404 126
records 1 404 126
secret. 1 404 126

But 0 404 127
here’s 0 404 127
another 0 404 127
example, 0 404 127
a 0 404 127
small 0 404 127
but 0 404 127
important 0 404 127
one: 0 404 127
Recall 0 404 127
that 0 404 127
Oswald 0 404 127
supposedly 0 404 127
hid 0 404 127
the 0 404 127
rifle 0 404 127
before 0 404 127
he 0 404 127
headed 0 404 127
down 0 404 127
the 0 404 127
steps 0 404 127
from 0 404 127
the 0 404 127
sixth 0 404 127
floor 0 404 127
of 0 404 127
the 0 404 127
school 0 404 127
book 0 404 127
depository. 0 404 127

Ask 0 404 128
yourself: 0 404 128
If 0 404 128
someone 0 404 128
has 0 404 128
just 0 404 128
assassinated 0 404 128
the 0 404 128
president 0 404 128
of 0 404 128
the 0 404 128
United 0 404 128
States, 0 404 128
is 0 404 128
he 0 404 128
really 0 404 128
going 0 404 128
to 0 404 128
take 0 404 128
the 0 404 128
time 0 404 128
to 0 404 128
hide 0 404 128
the 0 404 128
rifle? 0 404 128

What 0 404 129
good 0 404 129
would 0 404 129
that 0 404 129
do? 0 404 129

Wouldn’t 0 404 130
officials 0 404 130
conduct 0 404 130
a 0 404 130
thorough 0 404 130
search 0 404 130
of 0 404 130
the 0 404 130
area? 0 404 130

Wouldn’t 0 404 131
an 0 404 131
assassin 0 404 131
instead 0 404 131
simply 0 404 131
leave 0 404 131
the 0 404 131
rifle 0 404 131
there 0 404 131
and 0 404 131
get 0 404 131
out 0 404 131
of 0 404 131
there 0 404 131
as 0 404 131
soon 0 404 131
as 0 404 131
he 0 404 131
could? 0 404 131

Then 1 404 132
why 1 404 132
the 1 404 132
hidden 1 404 132
rifle? 1 404 132

Because 1 404 133
it’s 1 404 133
consistent 1 404 133
with 1 404 133
a 1 404 133
frame-up. 1 404 133

The 0 404 134
framers 0 404 134
had 0 404 134
to 0 404 134
hide 0 404 134
the 0 404 134
rifle 0 404 134
in 0 404 134
advance 0 404 134
in 0 404 134
a 0 404 134
place 0 404 134
where 0 404 134
no 0 404 134

would 0 404 135
see 0 404 135
it 0 404 135
during 0 404 135
the 0 404 135
morning 0 404 135
of 0 404 135
the 0 404 135
assassination, 0 404 135
which 0 404 135
took 0 404 135
place 0 404 135
after 0 404 135
noon. 0 404 135

No 0 404 136
matter 0 404 136
how 0 404 136
good 0 404 136
a 0 404 136
frame-up 0 404 136
was, 0 404 136
the 0 404 136
CIA 0 404 136
knew 0 404 136
that 0 404 136
it 0 404 136
could 0 404 136
be 0 404 136
detected 0 404 136
with 0 404 136
an 0 404 136
aggressive 0 404 136
investigation. 0 404 136

That’s 0 404 137
where 0 404 137
ingenuity 1 404 137
and 1 404 137
cunning 1 404 137
come 1 404 137
into 1 404 137
play. 1 404 137

They 0 404 138
had 0 404 138
to 0 404 138
figure 0 404 138
out 0 404 138
a 0 404 138
way 0 404 138
to 0 404 138
shut 0 404 138
down 0 404 138
the 0 404 138
investigation 0 404 138
so 0 404 138
that 0 404 138
the 0 404 138
frame-up 0 404 138
would 0 404 138
remain 0 404 138
intact. 0 404 138

That’s 1 404 139
why 1 404 139
they 1 404 139
had 1 404 139
shots 1 404 139
fired 1 404 139
from 1 404 139
the 1 404 139
front 1 404 139
and 1 404 139
placed 1 404 139
Oswald 1 404 139
in 1 404 139
the 1 404 139
rear. 1 404 139

The 0 404 140
idea 0 404 140
was 0 404 140
that 0 404 140
since 0 404 140
an 0 404 140
investigation 0 404 140
would 0 404 140
lead 0 404 140
to 0 404 140
Oswald’s 0 404 140
supposed 0 404 140
communist 0 404 140
confederates 0 404 140
in 0 404 140
the 0 404 140
front, 0 404 140
which 0 404 140
in 0 404 140
turn 0 404 140
would 0 404 140
lead 0 404 140
to 0 404 140
nuclear 0 404 140
war, 0 404 140
the 0 404 140
investigation 0 404 140
had 0 404 140
to 0 404 140
be 0 404 140
shut 0 404 140
down 0 404 140
immediately, 0 404 140
especially 0 404 140
since 0 404 140
it 0 404 140
was 0 404 140
the 0 404 140
CIA 0 404 140
itself 0 404 140
that 0 404 140
had 0 404 140
started 0 404 140
the 0 404 140
assassination 0 404 140
game 0 404 140
by 0 404 140
repeatedly 0 404 140
attempting, 0 404 140
in 0 404 140
partnership 0 404 140
with 0 404 140
the 0 404 140
Mafia, 0 404 140
to 0 404 140
assassinate 0 404 140
Castro. 0 404 140

It 0 404 141
was 0 404 141
one 1 404 141
of 1 404 141
the 1 404 141
most 1 404 141
brilliant 1 404 141
and 1 404 141
cunning 1 404 141
ruses 1 404 141
in 1 404 141
history. 1 404 141

They 0 404 142
get 0 404 142
the 0 404 142
body 0 404 142
out 0 404 142
of 0 404 142
Parkland 0 404 142
by 0 404 142

in 0 404 142
violation 0 404 142
of 0 404 142
Texas 0 404 142
law, 0 404 142
and 0 404 142
put 0 404 142
it 0 404 142
in 0 404 142
the 0 404 142
hands 0 404 142
of 0 404 142
the 0 404 142
military 0 404 142
in 0 404 142
Maryland, 0 404 142
which 0 404 142
conducts 0 404 142

The 0 411 19
outcome 0 411 19
of 0 411 19
these 0 411 19
two 0 411 19

be 0 411 19

by 0 411 19
“communist 0 411 19
aggression.” 0 411 19
The 0 411 19
resolution 0 411 19
served 0 411 19
as 0 411 19
Johnson’s 0 411 19
legal 0 411 19
justification 0 411 19
for 0 411 19
deploying 0 411 19

As 0 411 20
a 0 411 20
result, 0 411 20
58,177 0 411 20
Americans 1 411 20
would 0 411 20
lose 0 411 20
their 0 411 20
lives. 0 411 20

Additionally, 0 411 21
over 0 411 21
one 0 411 21

But 0 411 22
it 0 411 22
wasn’t 0 411 22

At 1 411 23
all. 1 411 23

somewhat 0 411 24
noble 0 411 24
in 0 411 24
the 0 411 24
eyes 0 411 24
of 0 411 24
the 0 411 24
world. 0 411 24

The 0 411 25
truth 0 411 25
of 0 411 25
the 0 411 25
matter 0 411 25
was 0 411 25
that 0 411 25
the 0 411 25
Maddox 0 411 25

and 0 411 25
the 0 411 25
Laotian 0 411 25

force. 0 411 25

When 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
government 0 411 26
announced 0 411 26
that 0 411 26
it 0 411 26
had 0 411 26
been 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
victim 0 411 26
of 0 411 26
an 0 411 26
unprovoked 0 411 26
attack—this 0 411 26
was 0 411 26
a 0 411 26
lie. 0 411 26

In 0 411 28
1995, 0 411 28

met 0 411 28

“Absolutely 0 411 29
nothing”, 0 411 29
Giáp 0 411 29
replied. 0 411 29

Giáp 0 411 30
claimed 0 411 30
that 0 411 30
the 0 411 30
attack 0 411 30
had 0 411 30
been 0 411 30
imaginary. 0 411 30

In 0 411 31
2010, 0 411 31
more 0 411 31
than 0 411 31
1,100 0 411 31
transcripts 0 411 31
from 0 411 31
the 0 411 31
Vietnam 0 411 31

released, 0 411 31
proving 0 411 31
Congress 0 411 31
and 0 411 31
officials 0 411 31
raised 0 411 31
serious 0 411 31

about 0 411 31

while 0 411 32
this 0 411 32
internal 0 411 32

took 0 411 32

a 0 412 12

Mr. 0 412 14

Zarate 0 412 14
acknowledged 0 412 14
firing 0 412 14
the 0 412 14

said 0 412 14
it 0 412 14
was 0 412 14
an 0 412 14

Zarate 0 412 15
and 0 412 15
his 0 412 15
defense 0 412 15
team 0 412 15
maintained 0 412 15
the 0 412 15
argument 0 412 15
that 0 412 15
the 0 412 15
suspect 0 412 15
found 0 412 15
the 0 412 15
stolen 0 412 15

on 0 412 15
the 0 412 15
pier 0 412 15
that 0 412 15
day 0 412 15
and 0 412 15
it 0 412 15
“just 1 412 15
fired.” 1 412 15
The 0 412 15
gun 0 412 15
belonged 0 412 15
to 0 412 15
a 0 412 15

parked 0 412 15

a 0 412 15
week 0 412 15

The 0 412 16
bullet 0 412 16
ricocheted 0 412 16
on 0 412 16
the 0 412 16
pier’s 0 412 16
concrete 0 412 16
walkway 0 412 16
before 0 412 16
it 0 412 16

Steinle, 0 412 16
killing 0 412 16
her. 0 412 16

Zarate 0 412 17
has 0 412 17
admitted 0 412 17
to 0 412 17
shooting 0 412 17
Steinle, 0 412 17
but 0 412 17
says 0 412 17
it 0 412 17

accident. 0 412 17

Garcia 0 412 18
Zarate 0 412 18
found 0 412 18
the 0 412 18
gun 0 412 18
at 0 412 18
the 0 412 18
pier… 0 412 18
but 0 412 18
the 0 412 18
stories 0 412 18
of 0 412 18
what 0 412 18
happened 0 412 18
copntradicted 0 412 18
one 0 412 18
another… 0 412 18

He 0 412 19
said 0 412 19
it 0 412 19
was 0 412 19
wrapped 0 412 19
in 0 412 19
cloth, 0 412 19
and 0 412 19
when 0 412 19
Garcia 0 412 19
Zarate 0 412 19
unwrapped 0 412 19
it, 0 412 19
the 0 412 19
gun 0 412 19
accidentally 0 412 19
discharged. 0 412 19

But 0 412 20
in 0 412 20
a 0 412 20
police 0 412 20
interrogation, 0 412 20
Garcia 0 412 20
Zarate 0 412 20
admitted 0 412 20
to 0 412 20
firing 0 412 20
the 0 412 20
gun, 0 412 20
saying 0 412 20
he 0 412 20
was 0 412 20
aiming 0 412 20
at 0 412 20
a 0 412 20
seal. 0 412 20

He 0 412 21
also 0 412 21
told 0 412 21
police 0 412 21
that 0 412 21
he 0 412 21
stepped 0 412 21
on 0 412 21
the 0 412 21
gun, 0 412 21
causing 0 412 21
it 0 412 21
to 0 412 21
fire. 0 412 21

But 0 412 22
still, 0 412 22
after 0 412 22
six 0 412 22

an 0 418 2

by 0 418 2
the 0 418 2
Asian 0 418 2

Patel 0 418 3
was 0 418 3
one 0 418 3
of 0 418 3
the 0 418 3
main 0 418 3
events 0 418 3
promoted 0 418 3
beforehand. 0 418 3

However, 0 418 4
his 0 418 4
jokes 0 418 4
quickly 0 418 4
progressed 0 418 4
to 0 418 4
uncomfortable 0 418 4
territory, 0 418 4
including 0 418 4
one 0 418 4
about 0 418 4
a 0 418 4
gay 0 418 4
black 0 418 4
man 0 418 4
who 0 418 4
lives 0 418 4
in 0 418 4
his 0 418 4
neighborhood 0 418 4
and 0 418 4
how 0 418 4
“[I]t 0 418 4
made 0 418 4
me 0 418 4
realize 0 418 4
that 0 418 4
being 0 418 4
gay 0 418 4
is 0 418 4
definitely 0 418 4
not 0 418 4
a 0 418 4
choice 0 418 4
because 1 418 4
no 1 418 4
one 1 418 4
wants 1 418 4
to 1 418 4
be 1 418 4
gay 1 418 4
and 1 418 4
black.” 1 418 4
The 0 418 4
tension 0 418 4
in 0 418 4
the 0 418 4
room 0 418 4
increased 0 418 4
as 0 418 4
Patel 0 418 4
told 0 418 4
more 0 418 4
jokes 0 418 4
in 0 418 4
this 0 418 4
vein 0 418 4
until 0 418 4
organizers 0 418 4
of 0 418 4
the 0 418 4
event 0 418 4
went 0 418 4
up 0 418 4
on 0 418 4
stage 0 418 4
to 0 418 4
stop 0 418 4
him, 0 418 4
citing 0 418 4
a 0 418 4
change 0 418 4
in 0 418 4
program 0 418 4
plans. 0 418 4

Patel 0 418 5
questioned 0 418 5
why 0 418 5
this 0 418 5
was 0 418 5
happening. 0 418 5

The 0 418 6
organizers 0 418 6
replied 0 418 6
that 0 418 6
the 0 418 6
person 0 418 6
in 0 418 6
charge 0 418 6
of 0 418 6
tech 0 418 6
had 0 418 6
to 0 418 6
leave 0 418 6
early, 0 418 6
but 0 418 6
Patel 0 418 6
continued 0 418 6
to 0 418 6
claim 0 418 6
that 0 418 6
he 0 418 6
was 0 418 6
being 0 418 6
cut 0 418 6
off 0 418 6
because 0 418 6
the 0 418 6
audience 0 418 6
didn’t 0 418 6
like 0 418 6
his 0 418 6
jokes. 0 418 6

At 0 418 7
one 0 418 7
point, 0 418 7
one 0 418 7
organizer 0 418 7
told 0 418 7
Patel 0 418 7
he 0 418 7
was 0 418 7
being 0 418 7
disrespectful. 0 418 7

When 0 418 8
asked 0 418 8
for 0 418 8
closing 0 418 8
remarks, 0 418 8
Patel 0 418 8
responded: 0 418 8
“I’m 1 418 8
a 1 418 8
generation 1 418 8
older 1 418 8
than 1 418 8
all 1 418 8

you 1 418 8
I 1 418 8
know 1 418 8
comedy,” 1 418 8
and 0 418 8
called 0 418 8
the 0 418 8
organizers 0 418 8
incorrect 0 418 8
in 0 418 8
ending 0 418 8
his 0 418 8
set. 0 418 8

He 0 418 9
tried 0 418 9
to 0 418 9
continue 0 418 9
speaking 0 418 9
until 0 418 9
his 0 418 9

was 0 418 9

A 0 419 1
rough 0 419 1
patch—or 0 419 1
a 0 419 1
double-dip 0 419 1
recession? 0 419 1

Economists 0 419 2
are 0 419 2
increasingly 1 419 2
befuddled 1 419 2
at 0 419 2
what 0 419 2
awaits 0 419 2
the 0 419 2
once-great 0 419 2
U.S. 0 419 2
economy. 0 419 2

And 0 419 3
Wall 0 419 3
Street 0 419 3
is 0 419 3
plainly 0 419 3
beginning 0 419 3
to 0 419 3
panic. 0 419 3

Unemployment 0 419 4
is 0 419 4
a 0 419 4
case 0 419 4
in 0 419 4
point. 0 419 4

It 0 419 5
now 0 419 5
seems 0 419 5
obvious 0 419 5
that 0 419 5
one 0 419 5
of 0 419 5
those 0 419 5
mysterious 1 419 5
memos 1 419 5
has 0 419 5
gone 0 419 5
out 0 419 5
to 0 419 5
the 0 419 5
Main 0 419 5
Stream 0 419 5
Media 0 419 5
saying 0 419 5
that 0 419 5
no-one 0 419 5
can 0 419 5
mention 0 419 5
the 0 419 5
immigration 0 419 5

solution. 0 419 5

But 0 419 6
unemployment 0 419 6
is 0 419 6
befuddling 0 419 6
anyway. 0 419 6

Just 0 419 7
a 0 419 7
few 0 419 7
weeks 0 419 7
ago 0 419 7
professional 0 419 7

came 0 419 8
in 0 419 8

54,000 0 419 8
in 0 419 8

the 0 419 8
smallest 0 419 8

since 0 419 8
September, 0 419 8
and 0 419 8
a 0 419 8

VDARE.com 0 419 10
has 0 419 10
long 0 419 10
argued 0 419 10
that 0 419 10
the 0 419 10

captures 0 419 10
the 0 419 10

it 0 419 10

back 0 419 20
further 0 419 20
and 0 419 20
the 1 419 20

Simply 1 419 23
put, 1 419 23
the 1 419 23
21st 1 419 23

This 0 419 24

repeatedly 0 420 7
expressed 0 420 7
his 0 420 7
contempt 0 420 7
for 0 420 7
it. 0 420 7

So 0 420 8
when, 0 420 8
in 0 420 8
2016 0 420 8
he 0 420 8
issued 0 420 8
a 0 420 8
document 0 420 8
on 0 420 8
contemplative 0 420 8
nuns, 0 420 8
the 0 420 8
faithful 0 420 8
braced 0 420 8
for 0 420 8
impact 0 420 8
. 0 420 8

In 0 420 9
his 0 420 9
recent 0 420 9
document, 0 420 9
ostensibly 0 420 9
on 0 420 9
holiness, 0 420 9
“Gaudete 0 420 9
et 0 420 9
Exultate,” 0 420 9
the 0 420 9
pope 0 420 9
attacked 1 420 9
the 0 420 9
religious 0 420 9
desire 0 420 9
for 0 420 9
silence 0 420 9
and 0 420 9
solitude, 0 420 9
to 0 420 9
be 0 420 9
alone 0 420 9
with 0 420 9
God 0 420 9
in 0 420 9
prayer, 0 420 9
seeking 0 420 9
unity 0 420 9
with 0 420 9
Him, 0 420 9
saying 0 420 9
in 0 420 9
essence 0 420 9
that 0 420 9
the 0 420 9
Christian 0 420 9
life 0 420 9
is 0 420 9
inherently 0 420 9
about 0 420 9
social 0 420 9
activism, 0 420 9
about 0 420 9
material, 0 420 9
worldly 0 420 9
ends. 0 420 9

To 0 420 10
these 0 420 10
foundations 0 420 10
of 0 420 10
the 0 420 10
contemplative 0 420 10
life 0 420 10
– 0 420 10
indeed 0 420 10
of 0 420 10
any 0 420 10
form 0 420 10
of 0 420 10
religious 0 420 10
life 0 420 10
in 0 420 10
the 0 420 10
Church 0 420 10
– 0 420 10
Francis 0 420 10
set 0 420 10
up 0 420 10
another 0 420 10
of 0 420 10
his 0 420 10
false 1 420 10
dichotomies, 0 420 10
contemplation 0 420 10
in 0 420 10
opposition 0 420 10
to 0 420 10
serving 0 420 10
others, 0 420 10
giving 0 420 10
a 0 420 10
Jesuit 0 420 10
maxim 0 420 10
as 0 420 10
an 0 420 10
imperative 0 420 10
for 0 420 10
all 0 420 10
Catholics: 0 420 10
“We 0 420 10
are 0 420 10
called 0 420 10
to 0 420 10
be 0 420 10
contemplatives 0 420 10
even 0 420 10
in 0 420 10
the 0 420 10
midst 0 420 10
of 0 420 10
action, 0 420 10
and 0 420 10
to 0 420 10
grow 0 420 10
in 0 420 10
holiness 0 420 10
by 0 420 10
responsibly 0 420 10
and 0 420 10
generously 0 420 10
carrying 0 420 10
out 0 420 10
our 0 420 10
proper 0 420 10
mission.” 0 420 10

Italian 0 420 11
Vaticanist 0 420 11
Marco 0 420 11
Tosatti 0 420 11
commented 0 420 11
dryly, 0 420 11
“Rejoice 0 420 11
and 0 420 11
be 0 420 11
glad… 0 420 11
but 0 420 11
not 0 420 11
if 0 420 11
you’re 0 420 11
a 0 420 11
cloistered 0 420 11
contemplative.” 0 420 11

In 0 420 12
2016, 0 420 12
I 0 420 12
wrote 0 420 12
that 0 420 12
Francis’ 0 420 12
Apostolic 0 420 12
Constitution, 0 420 12
“Vultum 0 420 12
dei 0 420 12
quaerere” 0 420 12
was 0 420 12
in 0 420 12
some 0 420 12
respects 0 420 12
the 1 420 12
most 1 420 12
damaging 1 420 12
object 0 420 12
of 0 420 12
the 0 420 12
wrecking-ball 1 420 12
pontificate 0 420 12
to 0 420 12
date. 0 420 12

Unfortunately, 0 420 13
it 0 420 13
was 0 420 13
about 0 420 13
a 0 420 13
subject 0 420 13
that 0 420 13
the 0 420 13
world, 0 420 13
and 0 420 13
therefore 0 420 13
the 0 420 13
modern 0 420 13
Church, 0 420 13
cares 0 420 13
so 0 420 13
little 0 420 13
about 0 420 13
that 0 420 13
hardly 0 420 13
anyone 0 420 13
noticed. 0 420 13

Aimed 0 420 14
specifically 0 420 14
at 0 420 14
female 0 420 14
contemplative 0 420 14
religious, 0 420 14
the 0 420 14
document 0 420 14
threatened 0 420 14
that 0 420 14
in 0 420 14
a 0 420 14
year 0 420 14
or 0 420 14
so 0 420 14
another 0 420 14
would 0 420 14
be 0 420 14
forthcoming 0 420 14
laying 0 420 14
out 0 420 14
precisely 0 420 14
what 0 420 14
would 0 420 14
now 0 420 14
be 0 420 14
required 0 420 14
of 0 420 14
nuns 0 420 14
to 0 420 14
continue 0 420 14
in 0 420 14
their 0 420 14
vocations. 0 420 14

The 0 420 15
new 0 420 15
document 0 420 15
issued 0 420 15
last 0 420 15
week, 0 420 15
“Cor 0 420 15
orans,” 0 420 15
is 0 420 15
juridical, 0 420 15
that 0 420 15
is, 0 420 15
it 0 420 15
is 0 420 15
not 0 420 15
much 0 420 15
more 0 420 15
than 0 420 15
a 0 420 15
list 0 420 15
of 0 420 15
specific 0 420 15
norms, 0 420 15
or 0 420 15
rules 0 420 15
– 0 420 15
289 0 420 15
of 0 420 15
them! 0 420 15

– 0 420 16
that 0 420 16
all 0 420 16
communities 0 420 16
of 0 420 16
contemplative 0 420 16
nuns 0 420 16
must 0 420 16
now 0 420 16
follow. 0 420 16

One 0 420 17
odd 0 420 17
remark 0 420 17
in 0 420 17
article 0 420 17
19 0 420 17
is 0 420 17
maybe 0 420 17
the 0 420 17
most 0 420 17
succinct 0 420 17
description 0 420 17
of 0 420 17
the 0 420 17
direction 0 420 17
planned 0 420 17
for 0 420 17
contemplatives: 0 420 17

“A 0 420 18
monastery 0 420 18
of 0 420 18
nuns, 0 420 18
as 0 420 18
every 0 420 18
religious 0 420 18
house, 0 420 18
is 0 420 18
erected 0 420 18
while 0 420 18
keeping 0 420 18
in 0 420 18
mind 0 420 18
its 0 420 18
usefulness 0 420 18
for 0 420 18
the 0 420 18
Church 0 420 18
and 0 420 18
for 0 420 18
the 0 420 18
Institute.” 0 420 18
(emphasis 0 420 18
added) 0 420 18

Wait… 0 420 19
its 0 420 19
“usefulness”? 0 420 19

I 0 420 20
think 0 420 20
a 0 420 20
fair 0 420 20
question 0 420 20
for 0 420 20
the 0 420 20
Faithful 0 420 20
to 0 420 20
ask 0 420 20
this 0 420 20
Vatican 0 420 20
department 0 420 20
might 0 420 20
be, 0 420 20
“According 0 420 20
to 0 420 20
what 0 420 20
specific 0 420 20
criteria 0 420 20
is 0 420 20
a 0 420 20
monastery’s 0 420 20
‘usefulness’ 0 420 20
actually 0 420 20
determined?” 0 420 20

One 0 420 21
can’t 0 420 21
help 0 420 21
but 0 420 21
hearken 0 420 21
back 0 420 21
to 0 420 21
the 0 420 21
criteria 0 420 21
for 0 420 21
monasteries 0 420 21
that 0 420 21
were 0 420 21
allowed 0 420 21
to 0 420 21
survive 0 420 21
the 0 420 21
revolutionary 0 420 21
purges 0 420 21
in 0 420 21
18th 0 420 21
and 0 420 21
19th 0 420 21
century 0 420 21
Europe. 0 420 21

A 0 420 22
house 0 420 22
that 0 420 22
could 0 420 22
prove 0 420 22
to 0 420 22
the 0 420 22
secularists 0 420 22
that 0 420 22
it 0 420 22
was 0 420 22
“useful” 0 420 22
– 0 420 22
that 0 420 22
it 0 420 22
could 0 420 22
care 0 420 22
for 0 420 22
the 0 420 22
indigent 0 420 22
elderly, 0 420 22
teach 0 420 22
children 0 420 22
or 0 420 22
nurse 0 420 22
the 0 420 22
sick 0 420 22
– 0 420 22
would 0 420 22
be 0 420 22
allowed 0 420 22
to 0 420 22
continue. 0 420 22

Those 0 420 23
which 0 420 23
were 0 420 23
purely 0 420 23
contemplative 0 420 23
– 0 420 23
a 0 420 23
single-minded 0 420 23
devotion 0 420 23
to 0 420 23
the 0 420 23
adoration 0 420 23
of 0 420 23
God 0 420 23
– 0 420 23
were 0 420 23
closed. 0 420 23

It 0 420 24
is 0 420 24
not 0 420 24
an 0 420 24
insignificant 0 420 24
quirk 0 420 24
of 0 420 24
modern 0 420 24
history, 0 420 24
and 0 420 24
one 0 420 24
that 0 420 24
tells 0 420 24
us 0 420 24
much 0 420 24
about 0 420 24
the 0 420 24
nature 0 420 24
of 0 420 24
the 0 420 24
current 0 420 24
pontificate, 0 420 24
that 0 420 24
houses 0 420 24
of 0 420 24
contemplatives 0 420 24
are 0 420 24
always 0 420 24
attacked 0 420 24
by 0 420 24
secularist 0 420 24
regimes, 0 420 24
from 1 420 24
Henry 1 420 24
VIII 1 420 24
to 1 420 24
the 1 420 24
Soviet 1 420 24
Union. 1 420 24

Rupture? 0 420 25

What 0 420 26
rupture? 0 420 26

The 0 420 27
first 0 420 27
thing 0 420 27
Cor 0 420 27
orans 0 420 27
does 0 420 27
is 0 420 27
claim 0 420 27
continuity 0 420 27
with 0 420 27
both 0 420 27
pre 0 420 27
and 0 420 27
post-Vatican 0 420 27
II 0 420 27
theology. 0 420 27

In 0 420 28
the 0 420 28
Introduction, 0 420 28
it 0 420 28
seems 0 420 28
anxious 0 420 28
to 0 420 28
establish 0 420 28
a 0 420 28
“hermeneutic 0 420 28
of 0 420 28
continuity” 0 420 28
with 0 420 28
Pius 0 420 28
XII 0 420 28
and 0 420 28
his 0 420 28
document 0 420 28
Sponsa 0 420 28
Christi 0 420 28
Ecclesia 0 420 28
of 0 420 28
1950. 0 420 28

The 0 420 29
authors 0 420 29
insist 0 420 29
there 0 420 29
is 0 420 29
no 0 420 29
contradiction 0 420 29
between 0 420 29
the 0 420 29
two 0 420 29
– 0 420 29
except, 0 420 29
of 0 420 29
course, 0 420 29
where 0 420 29
there 0 420 29
are 0 420 29
contradictions 0 420 29
– 0 420 29
and 0 420 29
that 0 420 29
both 0 420 29
Pius 0 420 29
XII 0 420 29
and 0 420 29
Francis 0 420 29
are 0 420 29
keen 0 420 29
to 0 420 29
see 0 420 29
nuns 0 420 29
reaching 0 420 29
the 0 420 29
“aim 0 420 29
of 0 420 29
their 0 420 29
specific 0 420 29
vocation.” 0 420 29
It 0 420 29
describes 0 420 29
Francis 0 420 29
as 0 420 29
promulgating 0 420 29
this 0 420 29
document 0 420 29
“in 0 420 29
the 0 420 29
wake” 0 420 29
of 0 420 29
Pius 0 420 29
XII[1]. 0 420 29

In 0 420 30
fact, 0 420 30
Pope 0 420 30
Francis, 0 420 30
by 0 420 30
promulgating 0 420 30
the 0 420 30
Apostolic 0 420 30
Constitution 0 420 30
Vultum 0 420 30
Dei 0 420 30
quaerere, 0 420 30
on 0 420 30
June 0 420 30
29, 0 420 30
2016, 0 420 30
to 0 420 30
help 0 420 30
the 0 420 30
contemplatives 0 420 30
reach 0 420 30
the 0 420 30
aim 0 420 30
of 0 420 30
their 0 420 30
specific 0 420 30
vocation, 0 420 30
invited 0 420 30
reflection 0 420 30
and 0 420 30
discernment 0 420 30
on 0 420 30
the 0 420 30
precise 0 420 30
content 0 420 30
tied 0 420 30
to 0 420 30
consecrated 0 420 30
life 0 420 30
in 0 420 30
general 0 420 30
and 0 420 30
to 0 420 30
the 0 420 30
monastic 0 420 30
tradition 0 420 30
in 0 420 30
particular, 0 420 30
but 0 420 30
he 0 420 30
did 0 420 30
not 0 420 30
intend 0 420 30
to 0 420 30
abrogate 0 420 30
Sponsa 0 420 30
Christi 0 420 30
Ecclesia 0 420 30
that 0 420 30
was 0 420 30
derogated 0 420 30
only 0 420 30
in 0 420 30
some 0 420 30
points. 0 420 30

As 0 420 31
a 0 420 31
consequence, 0 420 31
the 0 420 31
two 0 420 31
pontifical 0 420 31
documents 0 420 31
are 0 420 31
to 0 420 31
be 0 420 31
held 0 420 31
as 0 420 31
normative 0 420 31
in 0 420 31
force 0 420 31
for 0 420 31
monasteries 0 420 31
of 0 420 31
nuns 0 420 31
and 0 420 31
must 0 420 31
be 0 420 31
read 0 420 31
in 0 420 31
a 0 420 31
unitary 0 420 31
vision. 0 420 31

But 0 420 32
of 0 420 32
course, 0 420 32
the 0 420 32
entire 0 420 32
game 0 420 32
is 0 420 32
given 0 420 32
away 0 420 32
in 0 420 32
the 0 420 32
next 0 420 32
paragraph: 0 420 32

Pope 0 420 33
Francis, 0 420 33
in 0 420 33
the 0 420 33
wake 0 420 33
of 0 420 33
the 0 420 33
teaching 0 420 33
of 0 420 33

Ecumenical 0 420 33

II, 0 420 33

fruitful 1 420 33
path 0 420 33
taken 0 420 33
by 0 420 33
the 0 420 33
Church 0 420 33
in 0 420 33
the 0 420 33
last 0 420 33

in 0 420 33
the 0 420 33

of 0 420 33
the 0 420 33

of 0 420 33
the 0 420 33

considering 0 420 33
the 0 420 33
changed 0 420 33
socio-cultural 0 420 33
conditions. 0 420 33

Yes, 0 420 34
that’s 0 420 34
what 0 420 34
it 0 420 34
said. 0 420 34

Here’s 0 420 35
my 1 420 35
translation: 1 420 35

“The 0 420 36
Church’s 0 420 36
‘path’ 0 420 36
of 0 420 36
the 0 420 36
last 0 420 36
50 0 420 36
years 0 420 36
has 0 420 36
been 0 420 36
‘fruitful’. 1 420 36

How 0 420 37
do 0 420 37
you 0 420 37
know? 0 420 37

Because 0 420 38
we’re 0 420 38
telling 0 420 38
you 0 420 38
it 0 420 38
has.” 0 420 38

In 0 420 39
other 0 420 39
words, 0 420 39
there 0 420 39
have 0 420 39
been 0 420 39
absolutely 1 420 39
no 1 420 39
problems 1 420 39
whatever 1 420 39
with 0 420 39
the 0 420 39
direction 0 420 39
taken 0 420 39
either 0 420 39
by 0 420 39
the 0 420 39
Church 0 420 39
or 0 420 39
by 0 420 39
the 0 420 39
religious 0 420 39
life 0 420 39
since 0 420 39
Vatican 0 420 39
II. 0 420 39

Everything 0 420 40
that 0 420 40
has 0 420 40
happened 0 420 40
has 0 420 40
been 0 420 40
in 0 420 40
complete 1 420 40
and 1 420 40
perfect 1 420 40
continuity 0 420 40
between 0 420 40
the 0 420 40
Before 0 420 40
Church 0 420 40
and 0 420 40
the 0 420 40
After 0 420 40
Church; 0 420 40
there 0 420 40
has 0 420 40
been 0 420 40
no 0 420 40
rupture 0 420 40
or 0 420 40
break 0 420 40
with 0 420 40
the 0 420 40
past. 0 420 40

All 0 420 41
changes 0 420 41
undertaken 0 420 41
by 0 420 41
religious 0 420 41
houses 0 420 41
were 0 420 41
perfectly 1 420 41
legitimate 0 420 41
and 0 420 41
good 0 420 41
- 0 420 41
“fruitful” 1 420 41
if, 0 420 41
perhaps, 0 420 41
a 0 420 41
bit 0 420 41
“intense” 0 420 41
– 0 420 41
and 0 420 41
have 0 420 41
been 0 420 41
made 0 420 41
in 0 420 41
“light 0 420 41
of 0 420 41
the 0 420 41
teachings” 0 420 41
of 0 420 41
Vatican 0 420 41
II 0 420 41
and 0 420 41
“changed 0 420 41
socio-cultural 0 420 41
conditions.” 0 420 41
There 0 420 41
is, 0 420 41
therefore, 0 420 41
no 0 420 41
legitimate 0 420 41
reason 0 420 41
whatever 0 420 41
for 0 420 41
any 0 420 41
religious 0 420 41
house 0 420 41
to 0 420 41
attempt 0 420 41
to 0 420 41
“turn 0 420 41
back 0 420 41
the 0 420 41
clock” 0 420 41
to 0 420 41
the 0 420 41
pre-Vatican 0 420 41
II 0 420 41
norms 0 420 41
or 0 420 41
styles 0 420 41
of 0 420 41
religious 0 420 41
life. 0 420 41

Anyone 1 420 42
attempting 1 420 42
to 1 420 42
do 1 420 42
this 1 420 42
are 1 420 42
Bad 1 420 42
Nuns 1 420 42
[insert 0 420 42
string 0 420 42
of 0 420 42
incomprehensible 0 420 42
papal 0 420 42
insults 0 420 42
here.] 0 420 42

This 0 420 43
is 0 420 43
what 0 420 43
might 0 420 43
be 0 420 43
considered 0 420 43
the 0 420 43
guiding 0 420 43
principle 0 420 43
of 0 420 43
the 0 420 43
document; 0 420 43
“Nothing 0 420 43
to 0 420 43
see 0 420 43
here. 0 420 43

And 0 420 44
if 0 420 44
you 0 420 44
say 0 420 44
there 0 420 44
is, 0 420 44
you’re 0 420 44
the 0 420 44
problem.” 0 420 44

Of 0 420 45
course, 0 420 45
this 0 420 45
kind 0 420 45
of 0 420 45
bold 0 420 45
proclamation 0 420 45
is 0 420 45
very 0 420 45
much 0 420 45
in 0 420 45
keeping 0 420 45
with 0 420 45
the 0 420 45
habit 0 420 45
of 0 420 45
this 0 420 45
pontificate 0 420 45
to 0 420 45
simply 0 420 45
claim 0 420 45
there 0 420 45
are 0 420 45
no 0 420 45
problems 0 420 45
and 0 420 45
become 0 420 45
gravely 1 420 45
offended 1 420 45
and 1 420 45
outraged 1 420 45
when 0 420 45
the 0 420 45
contrary 0 420 45
is 0 420 45
pointed 0 420 45
out. 0 420 45

It’s 0 420 46
your 0 420 46
fault 0 420 46
if 0 420 46
you 0 420 46
find 0 420 46
contradictions, 0 420 46
not 0 420 46
theirs; 0 420 46
they’ve 0 420 46
said 0 420 46
there 0 420 46
are 0 420 46
no 0 420 46
contradictions, 0 420 46
therefore 0 420 46
there 0 420 46
aren’t 0 420 46
any. 0 420 46

After 0 420 47
all, 0 420 47
this 0 420 47
is 0 420 47
the 0 420 47
papacy 0 420 47
where 0 420 47
2 0 420 47
+ 0 420 47
2 0 420 47
= 0 420 47
5 0 420 47
if 0 420 47
the 0 420 47
pope 0 420 47
says 0 420 47
it 0 420 47
does. 0 420 47

The 0 420 48
irony, 0 420 48
of 0 420 48
course, 0 420 48
is 0 420 48
built 0 420 48
in, 0 420 48
since 0 420 48
this 0 420 48
document 0 420 48
is 0 420 48
intended 0 420 48
as 0 420 48
a 0 420 48
legal 0 420 48
chopping 0 420 48
block 0 420 48
for 0 420 48
the 0 420 48
dissolution 0 420 48
of 0 420 48
any 0 420 48
house 0 420 48
of 0 420 48
contemplative 0 420 48
nuns 0 420 48
that 0 420 48
is 0 420 48
judged 0 420 48
to 0 420 48
be 0 420 48
hovering 0 420 48
on 0 420 48
the 0 420 48
edge 0 420 48
of 0 420 48
extinction 1 420 48
or 0 420 48
is 0 420 48
for 0 420 48
some 0 420 48
other 0 420 48
reason 0 420 48
in 0 420 48
need 0 420 48
of 0 420 48
the 0 420 48
chop. 0 420 48

Why 0 420 49
would 0 420 49
the 0 420 49
Vatican 0 420 49
need 0 420 49
a 0 420 49
document 0 420 49
giving 0 420 49
extensive 0 420 49
norms 0 420 49
for 0 420 49
the 0 420 49
closure 0 420 49
of 0 420 49
monasteries 0 420 49
that 0 420 49
have 0 420 49
too 0 420 49
few 0 420 49
nuns 0 420 49
or 0 420 49
do 0 420 49
not 0 420 49
follow 0 420 49
their 0 420 49
originally 0 420 49
intended 0 420 49
charisms 0 420 49
if 0 420 49
everything 0 420 49
about 0 420 49
the 0 420 49
religious 0 420 49
life 0 420 49
since 0 420 49
Vatican 0 420 49
II 0 420 49
has 0 420 49
been 0 420 49
hunky 0 420 49
dory? 0 420 49

Let’s 0 420 50
remember 0 420 50
that 0 420 50
this 0 420 50
comes 0 420 50
from 0 420 50
the 0 420 50
Congregation 0 420 50
for 0 420 50
Religious 0 420 50
of 0 420 50
Braz 0 420 50
de’Aviz 0 420 50
and 0 420 50
Jose 0 420 50
Rodriguez 0 420 50
Carballo. 0 420 50

This 0 420 51
is 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
Cardinal 0 420 51
Braz 0 420 51
de’Aviz[2] 0 420 51
who 0 420 51
wasted 0 420 51
no 0 420 51
time 0 420 51
in 0 420 51
orienting 0 420 51
himself 0 420 51
in 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
New 0 420 51
Paradigm 0 420 51
when, 0 420 51
close 0 420 51
on 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
heels 0 420 51
of 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
Conclave 0 420 51
he 0 420 51
slammed 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
attempt 0 420 51
by 0 420 51
his 0 420 51
predecessor 0 420 51
– 0 420 51
and 0 420 51
by 0 420 51
extension 0 420 51
Pope 0 420 51
Benedict 0 420 51
– 0 420 51
to 0 420 51
reign 0 420 51
in 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
notorious 0 420 51
Leadership 0 420 51
Conference 0 420 51
of 0 420 51
Women 0 420 51
Religious 0 420 51
in 0 420 51
the 0 420 51
US. 0 420 51

He 0 420 52
complained 0 420 52
that 0 420 52
he 0 420 52
had 0 420 52
been 0 420 52
shut 0 420 52
out 0 420 52
of 0 420 52
the 0 420 52
process 0 420 52
under 0 420 52
Cardinal 0 420 52
Rode, 0 420 52
and 0 420 52
later 0 420 52
made 0 420 52
a 0 420 52
large 0 420 52
and 0 420 52
public 0 420 52
point 0 420 52
of 0 420 52
appeasing 0 420 52
and 0 420 52
mollifying 0 420 52
the 1 420 52
most 1 420 52
outspokenly 1 420 52
heretical 1 420 52
and 1 420 52
politicised 1 420 52
organisation 1 420 52
of 1 420 52
female 1 420 52
religious 1 420 52
in 1 420 52
the 1 420 52
world. 1 420 52

Apparently 0 420 53
the 0 420 53
total 0 420 53
statistical 0 420 53
collapse 0 420 53
of 0 420 53
the 0 420 53
religious 0 420 53
life 0 420 53
following 0 420 53
Vatican 0 420 53
II[3] 0 420 53
had 0 420 53
nothing 0 420 53
to 0 420 53
do 0 420 53
with 0 420 53
the 0 420 53
massive 0 420 53
systemic 0 420 53
changes 0 420 53
to 0 420 53
the 0 420 53
forms 0 420 53
of 0 420 53
that 0 420 53
life 0 420 53
– 0 420 53
always 0 420 53
claimed 0 420 53
to 0 420 53
be 0 420 53
“mandated” 0 420 53
by 0 420 53
“the 0 420 53
Council”. 0 420 53

And 0 420 54
of 0 420 54
course 0 420 54
we 0 420 54
are 0 420 54
talking 0 420 54
about 0 420 54
the 0 420 54
priorities 0 420 54
of 0 420 54
a 0 420 54
pope 0 420 54
who 0 420 54
has 0 420 54
said 0 420 54
that 0 420 54
seeing 0 420 54
a 0 420 54
“restorationist” 0 420 54
community 0 420 54
enjoying 0 420 54
a 0 420 54
large 0 420 54
number 0 420 54
of 0 420 54
vocations 0 420 54
makes 0 420 54
him 0 420 54
“worry.” 0 420 54
Apparently 0 420 54
this 0 420 54
worry 0 420 54
was 0 420 54
serious 0 420 54
enough 0 420 54
to 0 420 54
move 0 420 54
him 0 420 54
to 0 420 54
torpedo 1 420 54
one 0 420 54
of 0 420 54
the 1 420 54
most 1 420 54
flourishing 1 420 54
communities 0 420 54
in 0 420 54
the 0 420 54
modern 0 420 54
Church; 0 420 54
the 0 420 54
gaunt 1 420 54
spectre 0 420 54
of 0 420 54
the 0 420 54
Franciscan 0 420 54
Friars 0 420 54
and 0 420 54
Sisters 0 420 54
of 0 420 54
the 0 420 54
Immaculate 0 420 54
haunts 0 420 54
this 0 420 54
document. 0 420 54

Autonomy 1 420 55
vs. 0 420 55

Independence 0 420 56

One 0 420 57
of 0 420 57
the 0 420 57
talking 0 420 57
points 0 420 57
the 0 420 57
media 0 420 57
have 0 420 57
latched 0 420 57
onto 0 420 57
is 0 420 57
the 0 420 57
whole 0 420 57
business 0 420 57
of 0 420 57
“autonomy” 1 420 57
of 0 420 57
monasteries. 0 420 57

Many 0 420 58
of 0 420 58
the 0 420 58
headlines 0 420 58
crowed: 0 420 58
“Vatican 0 420 58
confirms 0 420 58
nuns’ 0 420 58
autonomy,” 1 420 58
or 0 420 58
similar. 0 420 58

But 0 420 59
that 0 420 59
word 0 420 59
does 0 420 59
not 0 420 59
mean 0 420 59
what 0 420 59
they 0 420 59
think 0 420 59
it 0 420 59
means. 0 420 59

In 0 420 60
fact, 0 420 60
the 0 420 60
word 0 420 60
“autonomy” 1 420 60
is 0 420 60
the 0 420 60
key 0 420 60
to 0 420 60
understanding 0 420 60
this 0 420 60
whole 0 420 60
thing. 0 420 60

It 0 420 61
appears 0 420 61
in 0 420 61
the 0 420 61
document 0 420 61
16 0 420 61

30 0 420 61
times. 0 420 61

In 0 420 62
fact, 0 420 62
“autonomy” 1 420 62
is 0 420 62
held 0 420 62
up 0 420 62
as 0 420 62
the 0 420 62
single 0 420 62
most 0 420 62
important 0 420 62
criterion 0 420 62

viability. 0 420 62

This 0 420 63

often 0 420 63
one 0 420 63

almost 0 420 63
think 0 420 63
there 0 420 63
is 0 420 63
a 0 420 63
concern 0 420 63
in 0 420 63
Rome 0 420 63
that 0 420 63

the 0 420 72

this 0 420 72

redefining 0 420 72
the 0 420 72

What 0 420 73
got 0 420 73
no 0 420 73
mention 0 420 73
in 0 420 73
the 0 420 73
brief 0 420 73
press 0 420 73
interest 0 420 73
was 0 420 73
the 0 420 73
document’s 0 420 73

that 0 420 73
all 0 420 73

must 0 420 73
belong 0 420 73

a 0 420 73
federation 0 420 73

monasteries 0 420 73
must 0 420 73
demonstrate 0 420 73
“autonomy” 1 420 73
they 0 420 73
will 0 420 73
be 0 420 73
granted 0 420 73
little 0 420 73
in 0 420 73
the 0 420 73
way 0 420 73
of 0 420 73
powers 0 420 73

self-governance. 0 420 73

As 0 420 74
we 0 420 74
will 0 420 74
see, 0 420 74
the 0 420 74
federations 0 420 74
are 0 420 74
now 0 420 74
a 0 420 74
multilayered 0 420 74
system 0 420 74
of 0 420 74
internal 0 420 74
surveillance 0 420 74
and 0 420 74
centralised 0 420 74
control 0 420 74
that 0 420 74
leaves 0 420 74

in 0 420 74
the 0 420 74
dust: 0 420 74

overcome 0 420 75

and 0 420 75
promote 0 420 75

contemplative 0 420 75
life. 0 420 75

Federation 0 420 76
of 0 420 76
monasteries 0 420 76
means 0 420 76
a 0 420 76
structure 0 420 76
of 0 420 76
communion 0 420 76
among 0 420 76
some 0 420 76
autonomous 0 420 76
monasteries 0 420 76
of 0 420 76
the 0 420 76
same 0 420 76
Institute 0 420 76
[4] 0 420 76
, 0 420 76
erected 0 420 76
by 0 420 76
the 0 420 76
Holy 0 420 76
See 0 420 76
that 0 420 76
approves 0 420 76
the 0 420 76
Statutes, 0 420 76
so 0 420 76
that 0 420 76
in 0 420 76
sharing 0 420 76
the 0 420 76
same 0 420 76

promote 0 420 76
regular 0 420 76

and 0 420 76
contemplative 0 420 76
life. 0 420 76

Note 0 420 77
the 0 420 77
change: 0 420 77
“independent” 0 420 77
is 0 420 77
replaced 0 420 77
with 0 420 77
“isolated[5].” 0 420 77
It 0 420 77
reminds 0 420 77
me 0 420 77
of 0 420 77
a 0 420 77
conversation 0 420 77
I 0 420 77
had 0 420 77
with 0 420 77
a 0 420 77
superior 0 420 77
of 0 420 77
a 0 420 77
Benedictine 0 420 77
house 0 420 77
in 0 420 77
the 0 420 77
UK. 0 420 77

She 0 420 78
said 0 420 78
she 0 420 78
thought 0 420 78
that 0 420 78
the 0 420 78
psychiatric 0 420 78
testing, 0 420 78
that 0 420 78
in 0 420 78
2008 0 420 78
was 0 420 78
still 0 420 78
all 0 420 78
the 0 420 78
rage 0 420 78
among 0 420 78
the 0 420 78
houses 0 420 78
of 0 420 78
her 0 420 78
monastery’s 0 420 78
federation, 0 420 78
was 0 420 78
excessive 0 420 78
and 0 420 78
not 0 420 78
helpful. 0 420 78

She 0 420 79
didn’t 0 420 79
trust 0 420 79
the 0 420 79
heavily 0 420 79
secularised 0 420 79
field 0 420 79
of 0 420 79
psychology 0 420 79
to 0 420 79
help 0 420 79
in 0 420 79
determining 0 420 79
a 0 420 79
candidate’s 0 420 79
suitability 0 420 79
for 0 420 79
religious 0 420 79
life, 0 420 79
so 0 420 79
she 0 420 79
didn’t 0 420 79
require 0 420 79
these 0 420 79
tests 0 420 79
of 0 420 79
her 0 420 79
monastery’s 0 420 79
postulants. 0 420 79

She 0 420 80
also 0 420 80
said 0 420 80
that 0 420 80
she 0 420 80
was 0 420 80
under 0 420 80
constant 0 420 80
pressure, 0 420 80
both 0 420 80
the 0 420 80
subtle 0 420 80
pressure 0 420 80
of 0 420 80
general 0 420 80
peer 0 420 80
disapproval 0 420 80
and 0 420 80
overt 0 420 80
requests 0 420 80
to 0 420 80
conform 0 420 80
by 0 420 80
the 0 420 80
federation’s 0 420 80
leadership. 0 420 80

Was 0 420 81
that 0 420 81
monastery 0 420 81
“isolated”? 0 420 81

Or 0 420 82
just 0 420 82
exercising 0 420 82
lawful 0 420 82
self-governance? 0 420 82

And 0 420 83
given 0 420 83
that 0 420 83
autonomy 1 420 83
is 0 420 83
being 0 420 83
held 0 420 83
up 0 420 83
as 0 420 83
the 0 420 83
sole 0 420 83
criterion 0 420 83
for 0 420 83
viability 0 420 83
of 0 420 83
a 0 420 83
monastery, 0 420 83
it 0 420 83
seems 0 420 83
the 0 420 83
Holy 0 420 83
See 0 420 83
is 0 420 83
not 0 420 83
interested 0 420 83
in 0 420 83
asking 0 420 83
whether 0 420 83
it 0 420 83
is 0 420 83
actually 0 420 83
faithful 0 420 83
to 0 420 83
the 0 420 83
charism, 0 420 83
or 0 420 83
even 0 420 83
to 0 420 83
the 0 420 83
Catholic 0 420 83
Faith, 0 420 83
a 0 420 83
question 0 420 83
that 0 420 83
has 0 420 83
burned 0 420 83
brightly 0 420 83
for 0 420 83
serious 0 420 83
Catholics 0 420 83
for 0 420 83
some 0 420 83
time. 0 420 83

The 0 420 84
word 0 420 84
“fidelity” 0 420 84
appears 0 420 84
in 0 420 84
the 0 420 84
document 0 420 84
four 0 420 84
times, 0 420 84
which 0 420 84
may 0 420 84
give 0 420 84
an 0 420 84
idea 0 420 84
of 0 420 84
how 0 420 84
much 0 420 84
interest 0 420 84
the 0 420 84
Vatican 0 420 84
has 0 420 84
in 0 420 84
this 0 420 84
issue. 0 420 84

Funny 0 420 85
you 0 420 85
should 0 420 85
mention 0 420 85
autonomy: 1 420 85
Bioethics 0 420 85
and 0 420 85
the 0 420 85
dissolution 0 420 85
of 0 420 85
“unviable” 0 420 85
monasteries 0 420 85

It’s 0 420 86
funny 0 420 86
that 0 420 86
the 0 420 86
buzzword 0 420 86
of 0 420 86
the 0 420 86
day 0 420 86
in 0 420 86
Rome 0 420 86
should 0 420 86
be 0 420 86
“autonomy”. 1 420 86

As 0 420 87
we 0 420 87
shall 0 420 87
see, 0 420 87
the 0 420 87
document 0 420 87
is 0 420 87
what 0 420 87
I’ve 0 420 87
called 0 420 87
above 0 420 87
a 0 420 87
“chopping 0 420 87
block”. 0 420 87

Vultum 0 420 88
dei 0 420 88
quaerere 0 420 88
made 0 420 88
it 0 420 88
clear 0 420 88
that 0 420 88
this 0 420 88
juridical 0 420 88
document 0 420 88
would 0 420 88
provide 0 420 88
a 0 420 88
set 0 420 88
of 0 420 88
legal 0 420 88
criteria 0 420 88
by 0 420 88
which 0 420 88
a 0 420 88
monastery 0 420 88
can 0 420 88
be 0 420 88
considered 0 420 88
viable, 0 420 88
religious 0 420 88
life 0 420 88
worthy 0 420 88
of 0 420 88
life, 0 420 88
so 0 420 88
to 0 420 88
speak, 0 420 88

system, 0 420 104
in 0 420 104
other 0 420 104

is 0 420 104

the 0 420 104

these 0 420 105

I 0 420 106
think 0 420 106
we 0 420 106
can 0 420 106
find 0 420 106
an 0 420 106
almost 0 420 106
perfect 0 420 106
analogy 0 420 106
by 0 420 106
replacing 0 420 106
the 0 420 106
term 0 420 106
“patient” 0 420 106
with 0 420 106
“monastery.” 0 420 106
Think 0 420 106
about 0 420 106
how 0 420 106
one 0 420 106
would 0 420 106
apply 0 420 106
concepts 0 420 106
like 0 420 106
“autonomy,” 1 420 106
“viability,” 0 420 106
“incapacity,” 0 420 106
“quality 0 420 106

the 0 420 107

One 0 420 154
of 0 420 154
these 0 420 154
things 0 420 154
is 0 420 154
not 0 420 154
like 0 420 154
the 0 420 154
others. 0 420 154

Did 0 420 155
you 0 420 155
notice? 0 420 155

One 0 420 156
criterion 0 420 156
stands 0 420 156
out 0 420 156
as 0 420 156
indeterminate, 0 420 156
vague, 0 420 156
compared 0 420 156
with 0 420 156
the 0 420 156
other 0 420 156
concrete 0 420 156
and 0 420 156
measurable 0 420 156
standards. 0 420 156

One 0 420 157
aspect 0 420 157
of 0 420 157
legislative 0 420 157
analysis 0 420 157
that 0 420 157
I 0 420 157
learned 0 420 157
early 0 420 157
was 0 420 157
that 0 420 157
the 0 420 157
terms 0 420 157
used 0 420 157
are 0 420 157
of 0 420 157
utmost 0 420 157
importance. 0 420 157

If 0 420 158
a 0 420 158
term 0 420 158
is 0 420 158
vague 0 420 158
or 0 420 158
is 0 420 158
defined 0 420 158
incorrectly 0 420 158
that 0 420 158
is 0 420 158
a 0 420 158
“loophole”. 0 420 158

Or 0 420 159
it 0 420 159
could 0 420 159
perhaps 0 420 159
be 0 420 159
described 0 420 159
as 0 420 159
a 0 420 159
handle; 0 420 159
a 0 420 159
place 0 420 159
where 0 420 159
a 0 420 159
person 0 420 159
who 0 420 159
wants 0 420 159
to 0 420 159
effect 0 420 159
a 0 420 159
particular 0 420 159

can 0 420 159
grasp 0 420 159
a 0 420 159
piece 0 420 159
of 0 420 159
legislation 0 420 159
to 0 420 159
use 0 420 159
it 0 420 159
like 0 420 159
an 0 420 159
axe. 0 420 159

So, 0 420 160
how, 0 420 160
exactly, 0 420 160
is 0 420 160
it 0 420 160
to 0 420 160
be 0 420 160
determined 0 420 160
– 0 420 160
and 0 420 160
by 0 420 160
whom 0 420 160
– 0 420 160
that 0 420 160
a 0 420 160
group 0 420 160
of 0 420 160
nuns 0 420 160
possess 0 420 160
“the 0 420 160

and 0 420 160
transmitting 0 420 160
the 0 420 160
charism”? 0 420 160

What, 0 420 161
precisely, 0 420 161
does 0 420 161
the 0 420 161
term 0 420 161
“vitality” 0 420 161
mean 0 420 161
and 0 420 161
exactly 0 420 161
how 0 420 161
is 0 420 161
one 0 420 161
to 0 420 161
measure 0 420 161
out 0 420 161
how 0 420 161
much 0 420 161
is 0 420 161
required? 0 420 161

Is 0 420 162
this 0 420 162
one 0 420 162
of 0 420 162
Pope 0 420 162
Francis 0 420 162
little 0 420 162
personal, 0 420 162

of 0 420 162
which 0 420 162
only 0 420 162
he 0 420 162
knows 0 420 162
the 0 420 162
meaning? 0 420 162

Like 0 420 163
the 0 420 163
secret 0 420 163
to 0 420 163
how 0 420 163
nuns 0 420 163
are 0 420 163
to 0 420 163
smile 0 420 163
properly? 0 420 163

Does 0 420 164
the 0 420 164
inclusion 0 420 164
of 0 420 164
completely 0 420 164
subjective 0 420 164
criteria 0 420 164
belong 0 420 164
in 0 420 164
a 0 420 164
juridical 0 420 164

Or 0 420 165
is 0 420 165
it 0 420 165
in 0 420 165
there 0 420 165
in 0 420 165

prelates? 0 420 165

The 0 420 166
next 0 420 166
article 0 420 166
tells 0 420 166
us, 0 420 166
“It 0 420 166
is 0 420 166
the 0 420 166

Do 0 420 166
they 0 420 166

It 0 420 167
seems 0 420 167
important 0 420 167
to 0 420 167
ask 0 420 167
because 0 420 167
article 0 420 167

the 0 420 168

should 0 420 168
be 0 420 168
considered 0 420 168
as 0 420 168
a 0 420 168
whole: 0 420 168
the 0 420 168

the 0 420 168
real 0 420 168
capacity 0 420 168
for 0 420 168
government 0 420 168
and 0 420 168
formation, 0 420 168
lack 0 420 168
of 0 420 168
candidates 0 420 168
for 0 420 168
a 0 420 168
number 0 420 168

fidelity[10]. 0 420 168

You 0 420 169
will 0 420 169
be 0 420 169
affiliated; 0 420 169
resistance 0 420 169
is 0 420 169
futile… 0 420 169

It 0 420 170
seems 0 420 170
there 0 420 170
are 0 420 170
two 0 420 170
themes 0 420 170
running 0 420 170
through 0 420 170
the 0 420 170
document: 0 420 170
to 0 420 170
establish 0 420 170
a 0 420 170
certain 0 420 170
value 0 420 170
of 0 420 170
“autonomy” 1 420 170
as 0 420 170
the 0 420 170
indispensable 0 420 170
criterion 0 420 170
for 0 420 170
viability, 0 420 170
while 0 420 170
at 0 420 170
the 0 420 170
same 0 420 170
time 0 420 170
asserting 0 420 170
top-down 0 420 170

to 0 420 170
make 0 420 170
this 0 420 170
determination. 0 420 170

In 0 420 171
short, 0 420 171
a 0 420 171
monastery 0 420 171
must 0 420 171
be 0 420 171
autonomous, 1 420 171
but 0 420 171
heaven 0 420 171
help 0 420 171
the 0 420 171
community 0 420 171
that 0 420 171
asserts 0 420 171
its 0 420 171
independence. 0 420 171

Articles 0 420 172

an 0 420 172
interim 0 420 172

in 0 420 172
the 0 420 172
case 0 420 172
of 0 420 172
“incapacity” 0 420 172
that 0 420 172
is 0 420 172
really 0 420 172
just 0 420 172

the 0 420 172

as 0 420 201

the 0 420 201

it 0 420 201

well 0 420 201
to 0 420 201

Carballo, 0 420 201
was 0 420 201
a 0 420 201
person 0 420 201
of 0 420 201
interest 0 420 201
to 0 420 201
international 0 420 201
police 0 420 201
agencies 0 420 201
for 0 420 201
the 0 420 201

of 0 420 201
“tens 0 420 201
of 0 420 201
millions” 0 420 201
of 0 420 201
Euros 0 420 201
from 0 420 201
the 0 420 201
coffers 0 420 201
of 0 420 201
the 0 420 201
Franciscan 0 420 201
Friars 0 420 201
Minor, 0 420 201
the 0 420 201
original 0 420 201
Franciscan 0 420 201
order 0 420 201
of 0 420 201

he 0 420 201
had 0 420 201
been 0 420 201
the 0 420 201
head. 0 420 201

Shortly 0 420 202
after 0 420 202
Carballo’s 0 420 202
appointment, 0 420 202
it 0 420 202
was 0 420 202
revealed 0 420 202
that 0 420 202
the 0 420 202
Swiss 0 420 202
prosecutor’s 0 420 202
office 0 420 202
was 0 420 202
investigating 0 420 202
the 0 420 202
money 0 420 202
missing 0 420 202
from 0 420 202
the 0 420 202
Friars 0 420 202
Minor 0 420 202
in 0 420 202
connection 0 420 202
with 0 420 202
drugs, 0 420 202
money 0 420 202

and 0 420 202
gun 0 420 202
running. 0 420 202

Carballo 0 420 203
was 0 420 203
Francis’ 0 420 203
very 0 420 203
first 0 420 203
appointment, 0 420 203
April 0 420 203
6, 0 420 203
2013, 0 420 203
three 0 420 203
weeks 0 420 203
after 0 420 203
the 0 420 203
Conclave 0 420 203
and 0 420 203
it 0 420 203
was 0 420 203
to 0 420 203
him 0 420 203
that 0 420 203
the 0 420 203
pope 0 420 203
gave 0 420 203
the 0 420 203
task 0 420 203
of 0 420 203
the 0 420 203
destruction 0 420 203
of 0 420 203
the 0 420 203
FFIs, 0 420 203
and 0 420 203
a 0 420 203
major 0 420 203
part 0 420 203
of 0 420 203
that 0 420 203
operation 0 420 203
was 0 420 203
to 0 420 203
separate 0 420 203
the 0 420 203
FFIs 0 420 203
from 0 420 203
real 0 420 203
assets 0 420 203
valued 0 420 203
at 0 420 203
about 0 420 203
30 0 420 203
million 0 420 203
Euros. 0 420 203

[9] 0 420 204
So 0 420 204
much 0 420 204
for 0 420 204
the 0 420 204
principle 0 420 204
of 0 420 204
subsidiarity. 0 420 204

I 0 420 205
can 0 420 205
imagine 0 420 205
what 0 420 205
a 0 420 205

founded 0 420 205
by 0 420 205
a 0 420 205
committee 0 420 205
would 0 420 205
be 0 420 205
like 0 420 205
to 0 420 205
live 0 420 205
in. 0 420 205

begins 0 421 1
Monday, 0 421 1
October 0 421 1
1. 0 421 1

Democrats 0 421 2
had 0 421 2
Kavanaugh 0 421 2
accuser 0 421 2
Christine 0 421 2
Blasey 0 421 2
Ford’s 0 421 2
never-credible 1 421 2
accusations 1 421 2
of 1 421 2
sexual 1 421 2
abuse 1 421 2
-- 0 421 2
including 0 421 2
possible 0 421 2
attempted 0 421 2
rape 0 421 2
-- 0 421 2
in 0 421 2
hand 0 421 2
way 0 421 2
back 0 421 2
in 0 421 2
the 0 421 2
summer. 0 421 2

They 1 421 3
deliberately 1 421 3
refused 1 421 3
to 1 421 3
bring 1 421 3
up 1 421 3
the 1 421 3
allegations, 1 421 3
as 1 421 3
weak 1 421 3
and 1 421 3
ridiculous 1 421 3
as 1 421 3
they 1 421 3
are, 1 421 3
at 1 421 3
Kavanaugh’s 1 421 3
Senate 1 421 3
confirmation 1 421 3
hearings 1 421 3
because 1 421 3
they 1 421 3
didn’t 1 421 3
want 1 421 3
to 1 421 3
have 1 421 3
a 1 421 3
rational 1 421 3
discussion. 1 421 3

They 0 421 4
wanted 0 421 4
to 0 421 4
hurl 1 421 4
the 1 421 4
wild 1 421 4
claims 1 421 4
like 1 421 4
a 1 421 4
grenade 1 421 4
at 0 421 4
the 0 421 4
last 0 421 4
minute 0 421 4
to 0 421 4
blow 0 421 4
up 0 421 4
the 0 421 4
process. 0 421 4

And 0 421 5
so 0 421 5
far 0 421 5
it 0 421 5
appears 0 421 5
they’re 0 421 5
succeeding. 0 421 5

If 0 421 6
Kavanaugh 0 421 6
isn’t 0 421 6
in 0 421 6
place 0 421 6
a 0 421 6
week 0 421 6
from 0 421 6
Monday, 0 421 6
the 0 421 6
Supreme 0 421 6
Court 0 421 6
will 0 421 6
begin 0 421 6
hearing 0 421 6
cases 0 421 6
in 0 421 6
its 0 421 6
new 0 421 6
term 0 421 6
shorthanded. 0 421 6

The 0 421 7
high 0 421 7
court 0 421 7
normally 0 421 7
has 0 421 7
a 0 421 7
complement 0 421 7
of 0 421 7
nine 0 421 7
justices 0 421 7
but 0 421 7
with 0 421 7
Associate 0 421 7
Justice 0 421 7
Anthony 0 421 7
Kennedy’s 0 421 7
retirement 0 421 7
July 0 421 7
31, 0 421 7
which 0 421 7
cleared 0 421 7
the 0 421 7
way 0 421 7
for 0 421 7
Kavanaugh’s 0 421 7
nomination, 0 421 7
there 0 421 7
have 0 421 7
only 0 421 7
been 0 421 7
eight 0 421 7
justices 0 421 7
in 0 421 7
place. 0 421 7

Roughly 0 421 8
speaking 0 421 8
there 0 421 8
is 0 421 8
a 0 421 8
4-to-4 0 421 8
liberal 0 421 8
to 0 421 8
conservative 0 421 8
ideological 0 421 8
split 0 421 8
on 0 421 8
the 0 421 8
court. 0 421 8

Democrats 0 421 9
would 0 421 9
prefer 0 421 9
to 0 421 9
drag 0 421 9
the 0 421 9
confirmation 0 421 9
process 0 421 9
into 0 421 9
the 0 421 9
next 0 421 9
Congress 0 421 9
where 0 421 9
they 0 421 9
hope 0 421 9
to 0 421 9
take 0 421 9
control 0 421 9
from 0 421 9
Republicans. 0 421 9

Election 0 421 10
Day 0 421 10
is 0 421 10
November 0 421 10
6. 0 421 10

The 0 421 11
GOP 0 421 11
currently 0 421 11
controls 0 421 11
the 0 421 11
Senate, 0 421 11
which 0 421 11
has 0 421 11
the 0 421 11
final 0 421 11
say 0 421 11
on 0 421 11
judicial 0 421 11
nominations, 0 421 11
by 0 421 11
an 0 421 11
uncomfortably 0 421 11
close 0 421 11
margin 0 421 11
of 0 421 11
51 0 421 11
to 0 421 11
49. 0 421 11

Christine 0 421 12
Blasey 0 421 12
Ford’s 0 421 12
lawyers 0 421 12
are 0 421 12
trying 0 421 12
to 0 421 12
game 0 421 12
the 0 421 12
system. 0 421 12

They 0 421 13
know 0 421 13
that 0 421 13
Senate 0 421 13
Judiciary 0 421 13
Committee 0 421 13
rules 0 421 13
require 0 421 13
Chairman 0 421 13
Chuck 0 421 13
Grassley 0 421 13
(R-Iowa) 0 421 13
to 0 421 13
provide 0 421 13
a 0 421 13
full 0 421 13
week’s 0 421 13
notice 0 421 13
for 0 421 13
a 0 421 13
hearing. 0 421 13

So, 0 421 14
if, 0 421 14
for 0 421 14
example, 0 421 14
the 0 421 14
committee 0 421 14
followed 0 421 14
the 0 421 14
rules 0 421 14
and 0 421 14
agreed 0 421 14
Friday 0 421 14
(today) 0 421 14
to 0 421 14
a 0 421 14
hearing, 0 421 14
the 0 421 14
soonest 0 421 14
it 0 421 14
could 0 421 14
be 0 421 14
held 0 421 14
would 0 421 14
be 0 421 14
next 0 421 14
Friday, 0 421 14
the 0 421 14
final 0 421 14
business 0 421 14
day 0 421 14
before 0 421 14
the 0 421 14
Supreme 0 421 14
Court’s 0 421 14
new 0 421 14
term 0 421 14
begins. 0 421 14

Of 0 421 15
course, 0 421 15
lawyers 1 421 15
are 1 421 15
masters 1 421 15
of 1 421 15
delay, 1 421 15
and 0 421 15
social 1 421 15
justice 1 421 15
warrior-lawyers 1 421 15
hoping 1 421 15
to 1 421 15
torpedo 1 421 15
President 1 421 15
Trump’s 1 421 15
agenda 1 421 15
have 0 421 15
an 0 421 15
added 0 421 15
incentive 0 421 15
to 0 421 15
drag 0 421 15
the 0 421 15
confirmation 0 421 15
process 0 421 15
out 0 421 15
as 0 421 15
long 0 421 15
as 0 421 15
possible. 0 421 15

New 0 421 16
demands 0 421 16
and 0 421 16
fake 0 421 16
emergencies 0 421 16
are 0 421 16
bound 0 421 16
to 0 421 16
arise 0 421 16
from 0 421 16
Ford’s 0 421 16
legal 0 421 16
team. 0 421 16

It 0 421 17
was 0 421 17
unclear 0 421 17
at 0 421 17
press 0 421 17
time 0 421 17
if 0 421 17
the 0 421 17
public 0 421 17
hearing 0 421 17
scheduled 0 421 17
for 0 421 17
Monday 0 421 17
into 0 421 17
the 0 421 17
allegations 0 421 17
of 0 421 17
sexual 0 421 17
misconduct 0 421 17
against 0 421 17
Kavanaugh 0 421 17
would 0 421 17
go 0 421 17
forward. 0 421 17

Kavanaugh 0 421 18
informed 0 421 18
the 0 421 18
committee 0 421 18
he 0 421 18
was 0 421 18
willing 0 421 18
to 0 421 18
testify 0 421 18
Monday. 0 421 18

“I 0 421 19
continue 0 421 19
to 0 421 19
want 0 421 19
a 0 421 19
hearing 0 421 19
as 0 421 19
soon 0 421 19
as 0 421 19
possible, 0 421 19
so 0 421 19
that 0 421 19
I 0 421 19
can 0 421 19
clear 0 421 19
my 0 421 19
name," 0 421 19
he 0 421 19
wrote 0 421 19
in 0 421 19
a 0 421 19
letter. 0 421 19

Ford's 0 421 20
lawyer 0 421 20
Debra 0 421 20
Katz 0 421 20
told 0 421 20
the 0 421 20
Judiciary 0 421 20
Committee 0 421 20
her 0 421 20
client 0 421 20
"wishes 0 421 20
to 0 421 20
testify, 0 421 20
provided 0 421 20
that 0 421 20
we 0 421 20
can 0 421 20
agree 0 421 20
on 0 421 20
terms 0 421 20
that 0 421 20
are 0 421 20
fair 0 421 20
and 0 421 20
which 0 421 20
ensure 0 421 20
her 0 421 20
safety." 0 421 20

Another 0 421 21
Ford 0 421 21
attorney 0 421 21
reportedly 0 421 21
said 0 421 21
Wednesday 0 421 21
that 0 421 21
there 0 421 21
are 0 421 21
“multiple 0 421 21
witnesses” 0 421 21
who 0 421 21
need 0 421 21
to 0 421 21
testify. 0 421 21

"A 0 421 22
hearing 0 421 22
on 0 421 22
Monday 0 421 22
is 0 421 22
not 0 421 22
possible 0 421 22
and 0 421 22
the 0 421 22
Committee's 0 421 22
insistence 0 421 22
that 0 421 22
it 0 421 22
occur 0 421 22
then 0 421 22
is 0 421 22
arbitrary 0 421 22
in 0 421 22
any 0 421 22
event,” 0 421 22
Katz 0 421 22
wrote 0 421 22
in 0 421 22
a 0 421 22
letter. 0 421 22

“Dr. 0 421 23

Ford 0 421 24
has 0 421 24
asked 0 421 24
me 0 421 24

let 0 421 24
you 0 421 24
know 0 421 24
that 0 421 24
she 0 421 24

various 0 421 24
options 0 421 24
you 0 421 24
have 0 421 24
suggested. 0 421 24

Her 0 421 25
strong 0 421 25
preference 0 421 25
continues 0 421 25
to 0 421 25
be 0 421 25
for 0 421 25
the 0 421 25

GOP 0 421 26
lawmakers 0 421 26
are 0 421 26
figuring 0 421 26
out 0 421 26
how 0 421 26
to 0 421 26
respond 0 421 26
to 0 421 26
Ford’s 0 421 26

Charles 0 421 27
E. 0 421 27
Grassley 0 421 27
(R-Iowa), 0 421 27
the 0 421 27
Judiciary 0 421 27
Committee 0 421 27
chairman, 0 421 27
said 0 421 27
that 0 421 27
his 0 421 27
staff 0 421 27
had 0 421 27
discussed 0 421 27
the 0 421 27
issue 0 421 27
with 0 421 27
Ford’s 0 421 27
attorney 0 421 27
earlier 0 421 27
in 0 421 27
the 0 421 27
day 0 421 27
and 0 421 27
that 0 421 27
he 0 421 27
would 0 421 27
consult 0 421 27
with 0 421 27
his 0 421 27

about 0 421 27
the 0 421 27
next 0 421 27
move. 0 421 27

Ford’s 0 421 28
offer 0 421 28
also 0 421 28
increased 0 421 28
the 0 421 28
pressure 0 421 28
on 0 421 28
several 0 421 28
key 0 421 28
moderates 0 421 28
— 0 421 28

GOP 0 421 28
Sens. 0 421 28

Susan 0 421 29
Collins 0 421 29

Lisa 0 421 29
Murkowski 0 421 29
of 0 421 29
Alaska 0 421 29
— 0 421 29
whose 0 421 29
votes 0 421 29
will 0 421 29
probably 0 421 29
be 0 421 29
needed 0 421 29
to 0 421 29
put 0 421 29
Kavanaugh 0 421 29
on 0 421 29
the 0 421 29
high 0 421 29
court. 0 421 29

Both 0 421 30
were 0 421 30
already 0 421 30
facing 0 421 30
heavy 0 421 30
pressure 0 421 30
from 0 421 30
abortion 0 421 30
rights 0 421 30
groups 0 421 30
concerned 0 421 30
that 0 421 30

conservative 1 421 30
and 0 421 30
longtime 0 421 30
GOP 0 421 30

might 0 421 30
vote 0 421 30
to 0 421 30

allegation, 0 421 31
which 0 421 31
the 0 421 31
nominee 0 421 31
has 0 421 31
denied, 0 421 31
has 0 421 31
upended 0 421 31
his 0 421 31
seemingly 0 421 31
sure-bet 0 421 31
confirmation 0 421 31
and 0 421 31
only 0 421 31
increased 0 421 31
the 0 421 31
stakes 0 421 31
for 0 421 31
the 0 421 31
key 0 421 31
lawmakers. 0 421 31

Chairman 0 421 32
Grassley 0 421 32
had 0 421 32
imposed 0 421 32
a 0 421 32
Thursday 0 421 32
deadline 0 421 32
for 0 421 32

the 0 421 32

demand 0 421 34
for 0 421 34

diGenova 0 421 34
said 0 421 34
earlier 0 421 34
this 0 421 34
week. 0 421 34

Ford 0 421 35
“really 0 421 35
doesn’t 0 421 35
want 0 421 35
to 0 421 35
testify,” 0 421 35
he 0 421 35
said. 0 421 35

“Because 0 421 36
when 0 421 36
she 0 421 36
does, 0 421 36
she 1 421 36
is 1 421 36
going 1 421 36
to 1 421 36
look 1 421 36
like 1 421 36
the 1 421 36
loon 1 421 36
she 1 421 36
is. 1 421 36

She 0 421 37
may 0 421 37
very 0 421 37
well 0 421 37
believe 0 421 37
everything 0 421 37
she’s 0 421 37
saying, 0 421 37
and 0 421 37
that 0 421 37
is 0 421 37
one 0 421 37
of 0 421 37
the 0 421 37
signs 0 421 37
of 0 421 37
lunacy, 0 421 37
believing 0 421 37
something 0 421 37
that 0 421 37
isn’t 0 421 37
real.” 0 421 37
And 0 421 37
her 1 421 37
lawyer 1 421 37
is 1 421 37
“even 1 421 37
loonier.” 1 421 37

Besides, 0 421 38
diGenova 0 421 38
explained, 0 421 38
the 0 421 38
eleventh-hour 0 421 38
sexual 0 421 38
abuse 0 421 38
claim 0 421 38
leveled 0 421 38
against 0 421 38
Kavanaugh 0 421 38
is 0 421 38
a 0 421 38
non-federal 0 421 38
matter 0 421 38
and 0 421 38
in 0 421 38
this 0 421 38
case 0 421 38
the 0 421 38
alleged 0 421 38
assault 0 421 38
hasn’t 0 421 38
even 0 421 38
been 0 421 38
clearly 0 421 38
outlined 0 421 38
by 0 421 38
the 0 421 38
alleged 0 421 38
victim. 0 421 38

Ford 0 421 39
didn’t 0 421 39
report 0 421 39
it 0 421 39
to 0 421 39
anyone 0 421 39
for 0 421 39
decades 0 421 39
and 0 421 39
isn’t 0 421 39
even 0 421 39
certain 0 421 39
when 0 421 39
or 0 421 39
where 0 421 39
it 0 421 39
happened, 0 421 39
so 0 421 39
the 0 421 39
FBI 0 421 39
can’t 0 421 39
investigate 0 421 39
the 0 421 39
matter 0 421 39
“because 0 421 39
there 0 421 39
is 0 421 39
nothing 0 421 39
to 0 421 39
investigate.” 0 421 39

Kavanaugh 0 421 40
has 0 421 40
already 0 421 40
undergone 0 421 40
six 0 421 40
FBI 0 421 40
background 0 421 40
checks 0 421 40
and 0 421 40
the 0 421 40
agency 0 421 40
has 0 421 40
ruled 0 421 40
out 0 421 40
investigating 0 421 40
Ford’s 0 421 40
allegation 0 421 40
of 0 421 40
drunken 0 421 40
groping 0 421 40
at 0 421 40
a 0 421 40
teenagers’ 0 421 40
party 0 421 40
36 0 421 40
years 0 421 40
ago. 0 421 40

Ford’s 1 421 41
request 1 421 41
for 1 421 41
an 1 421 41
FBI 1 421 41
probe 1 421 41
is 1 421 41
“clearly 1 421 41
a 1 421 41
desire 1 421 41
to 1 421 41
delay 1 421 41
proceedings,” 1 421 41
diGenova 0 421 41
said. 0 421 41

President 0 421 42
Trump 0 421 42
is 0 421 42
taking 0 421 42
the 0 421 42
high 0 421 42
road 0 421 42
and 0 421 42
is 0 421 42
avoiding 0 421 42
attacking 0 421 42
Ford, 0 421 42
which 0 421 42
isn’t 0 421 42
a 0 421 42
risky 0 421 42
move 0 421 42
given 0 421 42
how 0 421 42
obviously 1 421 42
unbalanced 1 421 42
the 1 421 42
accuser 1 421 42
is. 1 421 42

Ford 0 421 43
is 0 421 43
already 0 421 43
doing 0 421 43
an 1 421 43
excellent 1 421 43
job 1 421 43
destroying 1 421 43
herself 1 421 43
without 0 421 43
Republican 0 421 43
assistance. 0 421 43

At 0 421 44
the 0 421 44
White 0 421 44
House 0 421 44
on 0 421 44
Wednesday, 0 421 44
President 0 421 44
Trump 0 421 44
said 0 421 44
it 0 421 44
would 0 421 44
be 0 421 44
"wonderful" 0 421 44
if 0 421 44
Ford 0 421 44
testifies 0 421 44
and 0 421 44
"unfortunate" 0 421 44
if 0 421 44
she 0 421 44
does 0 421 44
not. 0 421 44

He 0 421 45
indicated 0 421 45
he 0 421 45
was 0 421 45
keeping 0 421 45
an 0 421 45

about 0 421 45

that 0 421 45
it 0 421 45
was 0 421 45
"very 0 421 45
hard 0 421 45

between 0 421 45
her 0 421 45
and 0 421 45

"I 0 421 46
think 1 421 46

an 1 421 46
extraordinary 1 421 46

– 1 421 46

telling 1 421 46
you, 1 421 46

he 1 421 46
has 1 421 46
an 1 421 46
unblemished 1 421 46
record," 1 421 46
Trump 0 421 46
said. 0 421 46

"This 0 421 47
is 0 421 47

for 0 421 47

our 1 422 14
enemy 1 422 14
and, 1 422 14
therefore, 1 422 14
it 1 422 14
continues 1 422 14
to 1 422 14
enable 1 422 14
our 1 422 14
defeat 1 422 14
in 1 422 14
the 1 422 14
terror 1 422 14
war. 1 422 14

It 0 422 15
is 0 422 15
urgent 0 422 15
that 0 422 15
we 0 422 15
name 0 422 15
our 1 422 15
enemy 1 422 15
(i.e. 1 422 15

Islamic 1 422 16
Jihad) 1 422 16
and 0 422 16
definitively 0 422 16
identify 0 422 16
what 0 422 16
ideology 0 422 16

our 1 422 16
enemy 1 422 16
(i.e. 1 422 16

Scrap 0 422 19
“Countering 1 422 19
Violent 1 422 19
Extremism.” 1 422 19

“Countering 1 422 20
Violent 1 422 20
Extremism” 1 422 20
is 0 422 20
the 0 422 20
pathetic 1 422 20
and 1 422 20
destructive 1 422 20
focus 0 422 20
of 0 422 20
the 0 422 20
Obama 0 422 20
administration 0 422 20
in 0 422 20
allegedly 0 422 20
fighting 0 422 20
the 0 422 20
terror 0 422 20
war. 0 422 20

On 0 422 21
the 0 422 21
one 0 422 21
hand, 0 422 21
this 0 422 21
“focus” 0 422 21
is 0 422 21
vague 0 422 21
to 0 422 21
the 0 422 21
point 0 422 21
of 0 422 21
being 0 422 21
meaningless 0 422 21
and 0 422 21
completely 1 422 21
incapacitates 1 422 21
us. 1 422 21

On 1 422 22
the 1 422 22
other 1 422 22
hand, 1 422 22
this 1 422 22
focus 1 422 22
allows 1 422 22
the 1 422 22
administration 1 422 22
to 1 422 22
perpetuate 1 422 22
the 1 422 22
destructive 1 422 22
fantasy 1 422 22
that 1 422 22
there 1 422 22
are 1 422 22
other 1 422 22
types 1 422 22
of 1 422 22
“extremists” 1 422 22
— 1 422 22
who 1 422 22
just 1 422 22
happen 1 422 22
to 1 422 22
be 1 422 22
the 1 422 22
Left’s 1 422 22
political 1 422 22
opponents 1 422 22
— 1 422 22
that 1 422 22
pose 1 422 22
a 1 422 22
great 1 422 22
threat 1 422 22
to 1 422 22
the 1 422 22
country. 1 422 22

For 0 422 23
example, 0 422 23
as 0 422 23
Stephen 0 422 23
Coughlin 0 422 23
has 0 422 23
revealed, 0 422 23
the 0 422 23
“violent 1 422 23
extremists” 1 422 23
the 0 422 23
administration 0 422 23
is 0 422 23
clearly 0 422 23
worried 0 422 23
about 0 422 23
are 0 422 23
the 0 422 23
“right-wing 1 422 23
Islamophobes” 1 422 23
whom 1 422 23
the 1 422 23
administration 1 422 23
obviously 1 422 23
considers 1 422 23
to 1 422 23
be 1 422 23
the 1 422 23
real 1 422 23
threat 1 422 23
to 1 422 23
American 1 422 23
security. 1 422 23

The 0 422 24
“Countering 1 422 24
Violent 1 422 24
Extremism” 1 422 24
is 1 422 24
trash 1 422 24
and 1 422 24
needs 1 422 24
to 1 422 24
be 1 422 24
thrown 1 422 24
in 1 422 24

that 0 422 28

a 0 422 32

Sebastian 1 422 41

correct, 1 422 41
therefore, 1 422 41
when 1 422 41
he 1 422 41
recommends 1 422 41
a 1 422 41
national 1 422 41
counter-propaganda 1 422 41
campaign 1 422 41
that 1 422 41
involves 1 422 41
a 1 422 41
two-part 1 422 41
approach: 1 422 41
the 0 422 41
first 0 422 41
being 0 422 41
the 0 422 41
bolstering 0 422 41
of 0 422 41
efforts 0 422 41
to 0 422 41
define 0 422 41
our 0 422 41
enemy 0 422 41
(Steps 0 422 41
#1 0 422 41
and 0 422 41
#4 0 422 41
above) 0 422 41
and, 0 422 41
second, 0 422 41
the 0 422 41
strengthening 0 422 41
of 0 422 41
our 0 422 41
allies 0 422 41
and 0 422 41
partners 0 422 41
in 0 422 41
their 0 422 41
own 0 422 41
counter-propaganda 0 422 41
efforts 0 422 41
– 0 422 41
which 0 422 41
must 0 422 41
include 0 422 41
our 0 422 41
empowering 0 422 41
of 0 422 41
Muslims 0 422 41
who 0 422 41
are 0 422 41
trying 0 422 41
to 0 422 41
form 0 422 41
an 1 422 41
anti-Jihadist 1 422 41
version 1 422 41
of 1 422 41
Islam. 1 422 41

Consequently, 0 422 42
educational 0 422 42
programs 0 422 42
have 0 422 42
to 0 422 42
be 0 422 42
set 0 422 42
up 0 422 42
everywhere, 0 422 42
from 0 422 42
public 0 422 42
schools 0 422 42
to 0 422 42
universities 0 422 42
to 0 422 42
workplaces, 0 422 42
in 0 422 42
businesses 0 422 42
and 0 422 42
numerous 0 422 42
other 0 422 42
institutions. 0 422 42

These 0 422 43
programs 0 422 43
must 0 422 43
crystallize 0 422 43
what 0 422 43
exactly 0 422 43
Islamic 0 422 43
Law 0 422 43
is 0 422 43

how 0 422 43
it 0 422 43
inspires 0 422 43
and 0 422 43
sanctions 0 422 43
violence 0 422 43
against 0 422 43
unbelievers. 1 422 43

This 0 422 44
has 0 422 44
to 0 422 44
also 0 422 44
involve, 0 422 44
as 0 422 44
Gorka 0 422 44
urges, 0 422 44
“a 0 422 44
nationwide 0 422 44
program 0 422 44
of 0 422 44

The 0 422 45

Once 0 422 48
the 0 422 48

that 0 422 48

and 0 422 48
sanctioned 0 422 48
by 0 422 48
their 0 422 48
Islamic 0 422 48
texts, 0 422 48
it 0 422 48
must 0 422 48
logically 0 422 48
become 0 422 48
required 0 422 48
that 0 422 48
mosques, 0 422 48
Islamic 0 422 48
schools 0 422 48
and 0 422 48
groups 0 422 48
have 0 422 48
to 0 422 48
immediately 0 422 48
curtail 0 422 48
any 0 422 48
teaching 0 422 48
that 0 422 48
motivates 0 422 48
sedition, 0 422 48
violence, 0 422 48
and 0 422 48
hatred 0 422 48
of 0 422 48
unbelievers 1 422 48
(i.e. 0 422 48

remember 0 422 49
how 0 422 49
CAIR 0 422 49

Indeed, 0 422 50
once 0 422 50
the 0 422 50
government 0 422 50

and 0 422 50

of 0 422 50
those 0 422 50

and 0 422 53
discard 0 422 53
the 1 422 53
suicidal 1 422 53

notion 1 422 53
that 0 422 53

As 1 422 55
Robert 1 422 55
Spencer 1 422 55
counsels, 1 422 55
this 0 422 55
has 0 422 55
to 0 422 55
involve 0 422 55
introducing 0 422 55
programs 0 422 55
that 0 422 55
teach 0 422 55
against 0 422 55
jihadists’ 1 422 55
understanding 0 422 55
of 0 422 55
Islam 0 422 55
— 0 422 55
and 0 422 55
these 0 422 55
programs 0 422 55
have 0 422 55
to 0 422 55
be 0 422 55
regularly 0 422 55
monitored 0 422 55
by 0 422 55
the 0 422 55
government. 0 422 55

(This 0 422 56
will 0 422 56
be 0 422 56
a 0 422 56
part 0 422 56

Spencer 0 422 57
rightly 0 422 57
stresses 0 422 57
that 0 422 57
the 0 422 57
paradigm 0 422 57
has 0 422 57
to 0 422 57
become 0 422 57
that 0 422 57
Muslim 0 422 57
communities 0 422 57
have 0 422 57
to 0 422 57
win 0 422 57
the 0 422 57
“trust” 0 422 57
of 0 422 57

rather 0 422 57
than 0 422 57
the 0 422 57
other 0 422 57
way 0 422 57
around, 0 422 57
which 0 422 57
is, 0 422 57
absurdly 1 422 57
and 1 422 57
tragically, 1 422 57
the 0 422 57
case 0 422 57
right 0 422 57
now. 0 422 57

Instead 0 422 60
of 0 422 60
having 0 422 60
Muslim 0 422 60

like 0 422 60

circumstances), 0 422 61
and 0 422 61

we 1 422 61
need 1 422 61
to 1 422 61
bring 1 422 61
in 1 422 61
people 1 422 61
who 1 422 61
actually 1 422 61
love 1 422 61
America 1 422 61
and 1 422 61
want 1 422 61
to 1 422 61
protect 1 422 61
it. 1 422 61

We 0 422 62
all 0 422 62
know 0 422 62
who 0 422 62
these 0 422 62

courageous 1 422 62

are 0 422 62
referenced 0 422 62
in 0 422 62
this 0 422 62
article. 0 422 62

The 0 422 63
government 0 422 63
must 0 422 63
also 0 422 63
bring 0 422 63
in 0 422 63
brave 1 422 63
Muslim 1 422 63
individuals 1 422 63
who 1 422 63
genuinely 1 422 63
reject 1 422 63
Jihad 1 422 63
and 0 422 63
empower 0 422 63
them 0 422 63
in 0 422 63
propagating 0 422 63
their 0 422 63
anti-jihadist 1 422 63
vision 1 422 63
for 0 422 63
Islam. 0 422 63

(P.S. 0 422 64

Yes, 0 422 65
there 0 422 65
is 0 422 65
an 0 422 65
argument 0 422 65
to 0 422 65
be 0 422 65
made 0 422 65
that 0 422 65
Islam 1 422 65
cannot 1 422 65
be 1 422 65
Islam 1 422 65
without 1 422 65

But 0 422 66
the 0 422 66
debate 0 422 66

this 0 422 66
belongs 0 422 66

And 0 422 67
whatever 0 422 67

it 0 422 67
does 0 422 67

anti-jihadist 0 422 67
Islamic 0 422 67

we 0 425 28

translating 0 425 29
our 0 425 29

our 0 425 30

was 0 425 30
met 0 425 30

of 0 426 26
2016 0 426 26
it 0 426 26
was 0 426 26
revealed 0 426 26
that 0 426 26
just 0 426 26
days 0 426 26
prior 0 426 26
to 0 426 26
the 0 426 26

2014 0 426 26

had 0 426 26
sent 0 426 26
another 0 426 26
email 0 426 26
in 0 426 26
which 0 426 26
he 0 426 26
expressed 0 426 26
his 0 426 26
eagerness 0 426 26
to 0 426 26
“fund” 0 426 26
the 0 426 26
campaign 0 426 26
efforts 0 426 26
and 0 426 26
wants 0 426 26
to 0 426 26
be 0 426 26
a 0 426 26
“head 0 426 26
outside 0 426 26
advisor.” 0 426 26
In 0 426 26
the 0 426 26
email 0 426 26
from 0 426 26
John 0 426 26
Podesta 0 426 26
to 0 426 26
Robby 0 426 26
Mook 0 426 26
we 0 426 26
learned 0 426 26
that: 0 426 26

I 0 426 27
met 0 426 27
with 0 426 27
Eric 0 426 27
Schmidt 0 426 27
tonight. 0 426 27

As 0 426 28
David 0 426 28
reported, 0 426 28
he’s 0 426 28
ready 0 426 28
to 0 426 28
fund, 0 426 28
advise 0 426 28
recruit 0 426 28
talent, 0 426 28
etc. 0 426 28

He 0 426 29
was 0 426 29
more 0 426 29
deferential 0 426 29
on 0 426 29
structure 0 426 29
than 0 426 29
I 0 426 29
expected. 0 426 29

Wasn’t 0 426 30
pushing 0 426 30
to 0 426 30
run 0 426 30
through 0 426 30
one 0 426 30
of 0 426 30
his 0 426 30
existing 0 426 30
firms. 0 426 30

Clearly 0 426 31
wants 0 426 31
to 0 426 31
be 0 426 31
head 0 426 31
outside 0 426 31
advisor, 0 426 31
but 0 426 31
didn’t 0 426 31
seem 0 426 31
like 0 426 31
he 0 426 31
wanted 0 426 31
to 0 426 31
push 0 426 31
others 0 426 31
out. 0 426 31

Clearly 0 426 32
wants 0 426 32
to 0 426 32
get 0 426 32
going. 0 426 32

He’s 0 426 33
still 0 426 33
in 0 426 33
DC 0 426 33
tomorrow 0 426 33
and 0 426 33
would 0 426 33
like 0 426 33
to 0 426 33
meet 0 426 33
with 0 426 33
you 0 426 33
if 0 426 33
you 0 426 33
are 0 426 33
in 0 426 33
DC 0 426 33
in 0 426 33
the 0 426 33
afternoon. 0 426 33

I 0 426 34
think 0 426 34
it’s 0 426 34
worth 0 426 34
doing. 0 426 34

You 0 426 35
around? 0 426 35

If 0 426 36
you 0 426 36
are, 0 426 36
and 0 426 36
want 0 426 36
to 0 426 36
meet 0 426 36
with 0 426 36
him, 0 426 36
maybe 0 426 36
the 0 426 36
four 0 426 36
of 0 426 36
us 0 426 36
can 0 426 36
get 0 426 36

from 0 426 37
February 0 426 37

Fernando 0 427 8
Karadima, 0 427 8
such 0 427 8
accusations 0 427 8
against 0 427 8
Barros 0 427 8
are 0 427 8
“all 1 427 8
calumny.” 1 427 8
The 0 427 8
pope’s 0 427 8
remarks 0 427 8
drew 0 427 8
shock 1 427 8
from 0 427 8
Chileans 0 427 8
and 0 427 8
immediate 0 427 8

from 0 427 8
victims 0 427 8
and 0 427 8
their 0 427 8
advocates. 0 427 8

They 0 427 9
noted 0 427 9
the 0 427 9
accusers 0 427 9
were 0 427 9
deemed 0 427 9
credible 0 427 9
enough 0 427 9
by 0 427 9
the 0 427 9
Vatican 0 427 9
that 0 427 9
it 0 427 9
sentenced 0 427 9
Karadima 0 427 9
to 0 427 9
a 0 427 9
lifetime 0 427 9
of 0 427 9
“penance 0 427 9

for 0 427 9
his 0 427 9
crimes 0 427 9
in 0 427 9
2011. 0 427 9

A 0 427 10
Chilean 0 427 10
judge 0 427 10
also 0 427 10
found 0 427 10
the 0 427 10
victims 0 427 10
to 0 427 10
be 0 427 10
credible, 0 427 10
saying 0 427 10
that 0 427 10
while 0 427 10
she 0 427 10
had 0 427 10
to 0 427 10
drop 0 427 10
criminal 0 427 10
charges 0 427 10
against 0 427 10
Karadima 0 427 10
because 0 427 10
too 0 427 10
much 0 427 10
time 0 427 10
had 0 427 10
passed, 0 427 10
proof 0 427 10
of 0 427 10
his 0 427 10
crimes 0 427 10
wasn’t 0 427 10
lacking. 0 427 10

[…] 0 427 11
The 0 427 11
Karadima 0 427 11

dominated 0 427 11
Francis’ 0 427 11

was 0 427 11
likely 0 427 11
to 0 427 11
factor 0 427 11
into 0 427 11
his 0 427 11
three-day 0 427 11

to 0 427 11
Peru 0 427 11
that 0 427 11
began 0 427 11
late 0 427 11
Thursday. 0 427 11

Karadima’s 0 427 12
victims 0 427 12
reported 0 427 12
to 0 427 12
church 0 427 12
authorities 0 427 12
as 0 427 12
early 0 427 12
as 0 427 12
2002 0 427 12
that 0 427 12

would 0 427 12
kiss 1 427 12
and 1 427 12
fondle 1 427 12

refused 0 427 12
to 0 427 12
believe 0 427 12
them. 0 427 12

Only 0 427 13
when 0 427 13
the 0 427 13
victims 0 427 13
went 0 427 13
public 0 427 13
with 0 427 13
their 0 427 13
accusations 0 427 13
in 0 427 13
2010 0 427 13
did 0 427 13
the 0 427 13
Vatican 0 427 13
launch 0 427 13
an 0 427 13
investigation 0 427 13
that 0 427 13
led 0 427 13
to 0 427 13
Karadima 0 427 13
being 0 427 13
removed 0 427 13
from 0 427 13
ministry. 0 427 13

The 0 427 14
emeritus 0 427 14
archbishop 0 427 14
of 0 427 14
Santiago 0 427 14
subsequently 0 427 14
apologized 0 427 14
for 0 427 14
having 0 427 14
refused 0 427 14
to 0 427 14

the 0 427 14
victims 0 427 14
from 0 427 14
the 0 427 14
start. 0 427 14

One 0 427 15
of 0 427 15
the 0 427 15
victims 0 427 15
made 0 427 15
clear 0 427 15
his 0 427 15
disgust 0 427 15
at 0 427 15
Pope 0 427 15
Francis 0 427 15
for 0 427 15
essentially 0 427 15
covering 0 427 15
up 0 427 15
for 0 427 15
a 0 427 15
man 0 427 15
who 0 427 15
watched 0 427 15
as 0 427 15
another 0 427 15
bishop 0 427 15
sexually 0 427 15
abused 0 427 15
him. 0 427 15

“As 0 427 16
if 0 427 16
I 0 427 16
could 0 427 16
have 0 427 16
taken 0 427 16

stood 0 427 16
by 0 427 16
watching 0 427 16
it 0 427 16
all,” 0 427 16
tweeted 0 427 16
Juan 0 427 16
Carlos 0 427 16
Cruz. 0 427 16

“These 1 427 17
people 1 427 17
are 1 427 17
truly 1 427 17
crazy, 1 427 17
and 0 427 17
the 0 427 17
pontiff 0 427 17
talks 0 427 17
about 0 427 17
atonement 0 427 17
to 0 427 17
the 0 427 17
victims. 0 427 17

Nothing 0 427 18
has 0 427 18
changed, 0 427 18
and 0 427 18
his 0 427 18
plea 0 427 18
for 0 427 18
forgiveness 0 427 18
is 0 427 18
empty.” 0 427 18

This 0 427 19
obviously 0 427 19
does 0 427 19
not 0 427 19
look 0 427 19
good 0 427 19

said 0 429 6
he 0 429 6
will 0 429 6
consult 0 429 6
with 0 429 6
Mueller 0 429 6
and 0 429 6
Deputy 0 429 6
Attorney 0 429 6
General 0 429 6
Rod 0 429 6
Rosenstein, 0 429 6
who 0 429 6
has 0 429 6
mostly 0 429 6
overseen 0 429 6
the 0 429 6
Special 0 429 6
Counsel’s 0 429 6
Office, 0 429 6
about 0 429 6
“what 0 429 6
other 0 429 6
information 0 429 6
from 0 429 6
the 0 429 6
report” 0 429 6
can 0 429 6
be 0 429 6
released 0 429 6
to 0 429 6
Congress 0 429 6
and 0 429 6
the 0 429 6
public. 0 429 6

The 0 429 7
White 0 429 7
House 0 429 7
and 0 429 7
President 0 429 7
Trump’s 0 429 7
lawyers 0 429 7
said 0 429 7
the 0 429 7
next 0 429 7
decisions 0 429 7
are 0 429 7
up 0 429 7
to 0 429 7
Barr. 0 429 7

There 0 429 8
is 0 429 8
a 0 429 8
possibility 0 429 8
that 0 429 8
Barr 0 429 8
releases 0 429 8
two 0 429 8
separate 0 429 8
reports. 0 429 8

One 0 429 9
would 0 429 9
summarize 0 429 9
Mueller’s 0 429 9
findings 0 429 9
without 0 429 9
including 0 429 9
classified 0 429 9
information 0 429 9
and 0 429 9
would 0 429 9
be 0 429 9
given 0 429 9
to 0 429 9
Congress—and 0 429 9
would 0 429 9
then 0 429 9
most 0 429 9
likely 0 429 9
find 0 429 9
its 0 429 9
way 0 429 9
out 0 429 9
into 0 429 9
the 0 429 9
public. 0 429 9

The 0 429 10
other 0 429 10
would 0 429 10
be 0 429 10
given 0 429 10
to 0 429 10
a 0 429 10
smaller 0 429 10
group 0 429 10
of 0 429 10
lawmakers 0 429 10
who 0 429 10
head 0 429 10
major 0 429 10
congressional 0 429 10

such 0 429 10
as 0 429 10
the 0 429 10

Rep. 0 429 11
Adam 0 429 11

chairman 0 429 11
of 0 429 11

called 0 429 11

transparency. 0 429 11

“Mueller’s 0 429 12
investigation 0 429 12
began 0 429 12
as 0 429 12
a 0 429 12
counterintelligence 0 429 12
inquiry 0 429 12
into 0 429 12
whether 0 429 12
individuals 0 429 12

with 0 429 12
the 0 429 12
Trump 0 429 12

compromised 0 429 12
by 0 429 12
a 0 429 12
foreign 0 429 12
power. 0 429 12

By 0 429 13
law, 0 429 13
that 0 429 13
evidence 0 429 13
he 0 429 13

with 0 429 13

he 0 429 13

in 0 429 13
a 0 429 13
tweet. 0 429 13

“And 0 429 14
his 0 429 14

also 0 429 14
be 0 429 14
made 0 429 14
public. 0 429 14

Now.” 1 429 15

Trump 0 429 16
has 0 429 16
previously 0 429 16
said 0 429 16
he 0 429 16
supports 0 429 16
the 0 429 16
idea 0 429 16
of 0 429 16
making 0 429 16
the 0 429 16
report 0 429 16
public. 0 429 16

“I 0 429 17
don’t 0 429 17
mind,” 0 429 17
he 0 429 17
has 0 429 17
said. 0 429 17

“I 0 429 18
mean, 0 429 18
frankly, 0 429 18
I 0 429 18
told 0 429 18

House, 0 429 18
‘If 0 429 18
you 0 429 18
want, 0 429 18
let 0 429 18
them 0 429 18
see 0 429 18
it.’” 0 429 18

Trump 0 429 19
has 0 429 19
also 0 429 19
vigorously 0 429 19
denied 0 429 19
any 0 429 19
wrongdoing 0 429 19
and 0 429 19
has 0 429 19
repeatedly 0 429 19
branded 0 429 19
the 0 429 19
probe 0 429 19
as 0 429 19
a 0 429 19
“total 1 429 19
witch 1 429 19
hunt.” 1 429 19

Mueller 0 429 20
will 0 429 20
remain 0 429 20
as 0 429 20
special 0 429 20
counsel 0 429 20
for 0 429 20
a 0 429 20
period 0 429 20
of 0 429 20
time 0 429 20
as 0 429 20
he 0 429 20
and 0 429 20
a 0 429 20
small 0 429 20
contingent 0 429 20
of 0 429 20
staff 0 429 20
close 0 429 20
the 0 429 20
office, 0 429 20
a 0 429 20
Justice 0 429 20
Department 0 429 20
spokesperson 0 429 20
reportedly 0 429 20
said. 0 429 20

The 0 429 21
handover 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
the 0 429 21
report 0 429 21
marks 0 429 21
the 0 429 21
end 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
an 0 429 21
investigation 0 429 21
that 0 429 21
has 0 429 21
for 0 429 21
nearly 0 429 21
two 0 429 21
years 0 429 21
transfixed 1 429 21
the 1 429 21
nation, 1 429 21
yielded 0 429 21
dozens 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
indictments 0 429 21
and 0 429 21
convictions, 0 429 21
and 0 429 21
brought 0 429 21
down 0 429 21
a 0 429 21
handful 0 429 21
of 0 429 21
Trump’s 0 429 21
closest 0 429 21
advisers. 0 429 21

The 0 429 22
Special 0 429 22
Counsel’s 0 429 22
Office 0 429 22
was 0 429 22
tasked 0 429 22
broadly 0 429 22
with 0 429 22
investigating 0 429 22
any 0 429 22
links 0 429 22
or 0 429 22
coordination 0 429 22
between 0 429 22
the 0 429 22
Russian 0 429 22
government 0 429 22
and 0 429 22
individuals 0 429 22
associated 0 429 22
with 0 429 22
the 0 429 22
Trump 0 429 22
campaign, 0 429 22
as 0 429 22
well 0 429 22
as 0 429 22
any 0 429 22
matters 0 429 22
that 0 429 22
arose 0 429 22
directly 0 429 22
from 0 429 22
the 0 429 22
probe. 0 429 22

However, 0 429 23
the 0 429 23
scope 0 429 23
of 0 429 23
the 0 429 23
investigation 0 429 23
seems 0 429 23
to 1 429 23
have 1 429 23
bled 1 429 23
outside 1 429 23
those 1 429 23
lines. 1 429 23

Several 0 429 24
witnesses, 0 429 24
for 0 429 24
example, 0 429 24
have 0 429 24
been 0 429 24
questioned 0 429 24
about 0 429 24
other 0 429 24
countries’ 0 429 24
efforts 0 429 24
to 0 429 24
meddle 0 429 24
in 0 429 24
American 1 429 24
politics, 0 429 24
including 0 429 24
Saudi 0 429 24
Arabia, 0 429 24
Israel, 0 429 24
the 0 429 24
UAE 0 429 24
and 0 429 24
Qatar. 0 429 24

So 0 429 25
far, 0 429 25
the 0 429 25
Special 0 429 25
Counsel’s 0 429 25
Office 0 429 25
has 0 429 25
indicted 0 429 25
or 0 429 25
obtained 0 429 25
guilty 0 429 25
pleas 0 429 25
from 0 429 25
34 0 429 25
people 0 429 25
and 0 429 25
three 0 429 25
companies. 0 429 25

Six 0 429 26
of 0 429 26
those 0 429 26
are 0 429 26
former 0 429 26
Trump 0 429 26
associates, 0 429 26
and 0 429 26
25 0 429 26
of 0 429 26
them 0 429 26
are 0 429 26
Russians. 0 429 26

No 0 429 27
Americans 0 429 27
have 0 429 27
been 0 429 27
charged 0 429 27
with 0 429 27
conspiring 0 429 27
with 0 429 27
Russians 0 429 27
to 0 429 27
meddle 0 429 27
in 0 429 27
the 0 429 27
2016 0 429 27
elections—at 0 429 27
least 0 429 27
none 0 429 27
the 0 429 27
public 0 429 27
knows 0 429 27
about. 0 429 27

But 0 429 28
major 0 429 28
Trumpworld 1 429 28
figures 1 429 28
were 0 429 28
charged 0 429 28
with 0 429 28
a 0 429 28
variety 0 429 28
of 0 429 28
other 0 429 28
crimes, 0 429 28
including 0 429 28
former 0 429 28
National 0 429 28

Adviser 0 429 28

Cohen. 0 429 28

Cohen 0 429 29
has 0 429 29
been 0 429 29
sentenced 0 429 29
to 0 429 29
three 0 429 29
years 0 429 29
in 0 429 29

committed 0 429 29
while 0 429 29
working 0 429 29

with 0 429 29
his 0 429 29

Manafort 0 429 30
was 0 429 30
sentenced 0 429 30
in 0 429 30
both 0 429 30
Virginia 0 429 30
and 0 429 30
in 0 429 30
Washington 0 429 30
and 0 429 30
will 0 429 30
serve 0 429 30
about 0 429 30
seven 0 429 30
years 0 429 30
in 0 429 30

In 0 429 31
Washington, 0 429 31
Manafort 0 429 31
was 0 429 31
sentenced 0 429 31
for 0 429 31
for 0 429 31
conspiring 0 429 31
against 0 429 31
the 0 429 31
U.S. 0 429 31
and 0 429 31
a 0 429 31
conspiracy 0 429 31
to 0 429 31
obstruct 0 429 31
justice 0 429 31
connected 0 429 31
to 0 429 31
his 0 429 31
covert 0 429 31

of 0 429 31
Ukraine’s 0 429 31
former 0 429 31
pro-Russian 0 429 31
government. 0 429 31

He 0 429 32
was 0 429 32
sentenced 0 429 32
in 0 429 32
Virginia 0 429 32
for 0 429 32
bank 0 429 32
and 0 429 32
wire 0 429 32
fraud. 0 429 32

The 0 429 33
Special 0 429 33
Counsel’s 0 429 33
Office 0 429 33
said 0 429 33
in 0 429 33
a 0 429 33
court 0 429 33
filing 0 429 33
last 0 429 33
week 0 429 33
that 0 429 33
it 0 429 33
had 0 429 33
gotten 0 429 33
all 0 429 33
it 0 429 33
can 0 429 33
out 0 429 33
of 0 429 33
Flynn, 0 429 33
who 0 429 33
has 0 429 33
been 0 429 33
cooperating 0 429 33
for 0 429 33
months 0 429 33
after 0 429 33
pleading 0 429 33
guilty 0 429 33
in 0 429 33
December 0 429 33
2017 0 429 33
to 0 429 33

with 0 429 33
Russian 0 429 33
Ambassador 0 429 33
Sergei 0 429 33
Kislyak. 0 429 33

It’s 0 429 34
unclear 0 429 34
when 0 429 34
he 0 429 34
will 0 429 34
be 0 429 34
sentenced 0 429 34
but 0 429 34
his 0 429 34
lawyers 0 429 34
want 0 429 34
to 0 429 34
wait 0 429 34
until 0 429 34
the 0 429 34
trial 0 429 34

in 0 429 34
Virginia. 0 429 34

Gates 0 429 35
has 0 429 35
also 0 429 35
been 0 429 35
cooperating 0 429 35
on 0 429 35
a 0 429 35
wide 0 429 35
variety 0 429 35
of 0 429 35

As 0 429 36
of 0 429 36
March, 0 429 36
Gates 0 429 36
was 0 429 36

the 0 430 2

a 0 430 2

So 0 430 3
who 0 430 3
is 0 430 3
Jesus 0 430 3

That 0 430 4
burning 0 430 4
question 0 430 4
has 0 430 4
bothered 0 430 4
many 0 430 4

the 0 430 4

there’s 0 430 4

no 0 430 4

The 0 430 5
ever-changing 0 430 5

now 0 430 5
though, 0 430 5
seems 0 430 5
to 0 430 5
swirl 0 430 5
around 0 430 5
this 0 430 5
unknown 0 430 5
mystery 0 430 5
security 0 430 5
guard. 0 430 5

At 0 430 6
first, 0 430 6
Campos, 0 430 6
a 0 430 6
guard 0 430 6
at 0 430 6
the 0 430 6
Mandalay 0 430 6
Bay 0 430 6
Resort 0 430 6
and 0 430 6
Casino, 0 430 6
was 0 430 6
hailed 0 430 6
a 0 430 6
hero 0 430 6
for 0 430 6
helping 0 430 6
guide 0 430 6
police 0 430 6
to 0 430 6
gunman 0 430 6
Stephen 0 430 6
Paddock’s 0 430 6
room 0 430 6
on 0 430 6
the 0 430 6
32nd 0 430 6
floor. 0 430 6

Police 0 430 7
said 0 430 7
Campos 0 430 7
was 0 430 7
shot 0 430 7
in 0 430 7
the 0 430 7
leg 0 430 7
at 0 430 7
the 0 430 7
end 0 430 7
of 0 430 7
Paddock’s 0 430 7
assault 0 430 7
on 0 430 7
concertgoers—potentially 0 430 7
distracting 0 430 7
the 0 430 7
gunman 0 430 7
and 0 430 7
causing 0 430 7
him 0 430 7
to 0 430 7
panic 0 430 7
and 0 430 7
kill 0 430 7
himself. 0 430 7

But 0 430 8
now, 0 430 8
questions 0 430 8
have 0 430 8
been 0 430 8
raised 0 430 8
after 0 430 8
Clark 0 430 8
County 0 430 8
Sheriff 0 430 8
Joe 0 430 8
Lombardo 0 430 8
revised 0 430 8
the 0 430 8
timeline 0 430 8
and 0 430 8
said 0 430 8
Campos 0 430 8
had 0 430 8
actually 0 430 8
been 0 430 8
shot 0 430 8
about 0 430 8
9:59 0 430 8
p.m. 0 430 8
a 0 430 8
(full 0 430 8
six 0 430 8
minutes 0 430 8
before 0 430 8
the 0 430 8
mass 0 430 8
shooting 0 430 8
began 0 430 8
at 0 430 8
10:05 0 430 8
p.m.) 0 430 8
which 0 430 8
means 0 430 8
the 0 430 8
guard 0 430 8
could 0 430 8
have 0 430 8
instead 0 430 8
led 0 430 8
Paddock 0 430 8
to 0 430 8
start 0 430 8
opening 0 430 8
fire 0 430 8
on 0 430 8
the 0 430 8
crowd 0 430 8
for 0 430 8
fear 0 430 8
of 0 430 8
being 0 430 8
caught. 0 430 8

Police 0 430 9
have 0 430 9
said 0 430 9
it 0 430 9
was 0 430 9
difficult 0 430 9
to 0 430 9
identify 0 430 9
the 0 430 9
source 0 430 9
of 0 430 9
the 0 430 9
bullets 0 430 9
during 0 430 9
the 0 430 9
attack, 0 430 9
and 0 430 9
the 0 430 9
confusion 0 430 9
added 0 430 9
more 0 430 9
minutes 0 430 9
to 0 430 9
their 0 430 9
lengthy 0 430 9
response. 0 430 9

But 0 430 10
the 0 430 10
revised 0 430 10
timeline 0 430 10
shows 0 430 10
officers 0 430 10
would 0 430 10
have 0 430 10
known 0 430 10
where 0 430 10
Paddock 0 430 10
was 0 430 10
before 0 430 10
the 0 430 10
mass 0 430 10
shooting 0 430 10
even 0 430 10
started. 0 430 10

Did 0 430 11
Campos 0 430 11
call 0 430 11
911? 0 430 11

What 0 430 12
happened 0 430 12
during 0 430 12
those 0 430 12
six 0 430 12
minutes? 0 430 12

Much 0 430 13
of 0 430 13
Campos’s 0 430 13
story 0 430 13
and 0 430 13
background 0 430 13
remains 0 430 13
a 0 430 13
mystery. 0 430 13

Campos’s 0 430 15
co-worker 0 430 15
Liliana 0 430 15

started 0 430 15
a 0 430 15

for 0 430 15
him 0 430 15
on 0 430 15

explaining 0 430 15
that 0 430 15
he’d 0 430 15
been 0 430 15
shot 0 430 15
while 0 430 15
on 0 430 15
“random 0 430 15

it 0 430 15
could 0 430 15
have 0 430 15
been 0 430 15
anyone 0 430 15
of 0 430 15

Strangely, 0 430 19
a 0 430 19
picture 0 430 19
of 0 430 19

wasn’t 0 430 19

as 0 430 19
part 0 430 19
of 0 430 19
the 0 430 19
fund 0 430 19
because 0 430 19
Rodriguez 0 430 19
indicated 0 430 19
that 0 430 19
“due 0 430 19
to 0 430 19
privacy 0 430 19
from 0 430 19

publishing 0 430 19

There 1 430 20
are 1 430 20
obviously 1 430 20
certain 1 430 20
things 1 430 20
that 1 430 20
the 1 430 20
FBI 1 430 20

seem 1 430 20
intent 1 430 20
on 1 430 20
covering 1 430 20
up. 1 430 20

Their 0 430 21
own 0 430 21

is 0 430 21
quickly 0 430 21
shattering. 0 430 21

about 0 430 22

some 0 430 22
of 0 430 22

it 0 430 22

added 0 430 22

of 0 430 22

McMahill 0 430 23
told 0 430 23
KNPR, 0 430 23
a 0 430 23
local 0 430 23
NPR 0 430 23
affiliate, 0 430 23
that 0 430 23
Campos 0 430 23
went 0 430 23
up 0 430 23
to 0 430 23
the 0 430 23
32nd 0 430 23
floor 0 430 23
to 0 430 23
investigate 0 430 23
a 0 430 23
door 0 430 23
alarm. 0 430 23

While 0 430 24
on 0 430 24
the 0 430 24
32nd 0 430 24
floor, 0 430 24
he 0 430 24
found 0 430 24
that 0 430 24
a 0 430 24
stairwell 0 430 24
door 0 430 24
was 0 430 24
jammed 0 430 24
and 0 430 24
radioed 0 430 24
down 0 430 24
to 0 430 24
maintenance. 0 430 24

Campos 0 430 25
heard 0 430 25
a 0 430 25
drilling 0 430 25
sound 0 430 25
and 0 430 25
thought 0 430 25
it 0 430 25
was 0 430 25
odd. 0 430 25

A 0 430 26
maintenance 0 430 26
worker 0 430 26
came 0 430 26
up 0 430 26
to 0 430 26
the 0 430 26
32nd 0 430 26
floor. 0 430 26

As 0 430 27
the 0 430 27
pair 0 430 27
started 0 430 27
talking, 0 430 27
Paddock 0 430 27
began 0 430 27
firing 0 430 27
through 0 430 27
the 0 430 27
door 0 430 27
of 0 430 27
his 0 430 27
room, 0 430 27
first 0 430 27
with 0 430 27
a 0 430 27
single-fire 0 430 27
gun 0 430 27
and 0 430 27
then 0 430 27
with 0 430 27
a 0 430 27
rapid-fire 0 430 27
rifle. 0 430 27

Police 0 430 28
have 0 430 28
said 0 430 28
that 0 430 28
when 0 430 28
Campos 0 430 28
radioed 0 430 28
what 0 430 28
happened, 0 430 28
it 0 430 28
helped 0 430 28
them 0 430 28
track 0 430 28
where 0 430 28
Paddock 0 430 28
was 0 430 28
holed 0 430 28
up 0 430 28
– 0 430 28
so 1 430 28
why 1 430 28
change 1 430 28

March 0 432 41
17 0 432 41

12 0 432 41
days 0 432 41

Kiko 0 432 45
said 0 432 45
in 0 432 45
an 0 432 45
April 0 432 45
2018 0 432 45
hearing 0 432 45
spurred 0 432 45
by 0 432 45
the 0 432 45
scandal 0 432 45
that 0 432 45
he 0 432 45
was 0 432 45
powerless 0 432 45
to 0 432 45
stop 0 432 45
members 0 432 45
who 0 432 45
refused 0 432 45
to 0 432 45
fire 0 432 45

bad 1 432 45
actor. 1 432 45

“Termination, 0 432 46

he 0 432 46
said. 0 432 46

He 0 432 47
added 0 432 47
that 0 432 47
his 0 432 47

the 0 432 47

Wasserman 0 432 48

became 0 432 48
fixated 0 432 48
on 0 432 48
finding 0 432 48
out 0 432 48
everything 0 432 48
investigators 0 432 48

felt 0 432 61
“very 0 432 61

that 0 432 61

just 0 434 0

always 0 434 1
get 0 434 1
the 0 434 1
same 0 434 1
kind 0 434 1
of 0 434 1
attention. 0 434 1

The 0 434 2
big 0 434 2
frigid 0 434 2
blue 0 434 2
ball 0 434 2
is 0 434 2
the 0 434 2
farthest 0 434 2
planet 0 434 2
from 0 434 2
the 0 434 2
Sun 0 434 2

since 0 434 2
we 0 434 2

count 0 434 2
Pluto 0 434 2
as 0 434 2
a 0 434 2
planet 0 434 2
anymore 0 434 2
— 0 434 2
and 0 434 2
it 0 434 2
hasn’t 0 434 2
been 0 434 2
studied 0 434 2
with 0 434 2
the 0 434 2

intensity 0 434 2
of 0 434 2
many 0 434 2
of 0 434 2
the 0 434 2

Thankfully 0 434 3
the 0 434 3
Hubble 0 434 3
Space 0 434 3
Telescope 0 434 3
hasn’t 0 434 3
lost 0 434 3
interest 0 434 3
in 0 434 3
the 0 434 3
distant 0 434 3
planet, 0 434 3
because 0 434 3
it 0 434 3
just 0 434 3
captured 0 434 3
one 0 434 3
of 0 434 3
Neptunes 0 434 3
massive 0 434 3
storms 0 434 3
losing 0 434 3
steam 0 434 3
as 0 434 3
it 0 434 3
roars 0 434 3
across 0 434 3
the 0 434 3
planet. 0 434 3

Storms 0 434 4
on 0 434 4
Neptune 0 434 4
appear 0 434 4
as 0 434 4
giant 0 434 4
dark 0 434 4
ovals, 0 434 4
a 0 434 4
bit 0 434 4
like 0 434 4
Jupiter’s 0 434 4
Great 0 434 4
Red 0 434 4
Spot. 0 434 4

However, 0 434 5
unlike 0 434 5
Jupiter’s 0 434 5
centuries-old 0 434 5
storm, 0 434 5
Neptune’s 0 434 5
hurricane-like 0 434 5
weather 0 434 5
events 0 434 5
only 0 434 5
last 0 434 5
a 0 434 5
few 0 434 5
years 0 434 5
at 0 434 5
a 0 434 5
time 0 434 5
before 0 434 5
eventually 0 434 5
dissipating. 0 434 5

Of 0 434 6
course, 0 434 6
that’s 0 434 6
not 0 434 6
to 0 434 6
say 0 434 6
the 0 434 6
storms 0 434 6
are 0 434 6
insignificant 0 434 6
— 0 434 6
many 0 434 6
are 0 434 6
large 0 434 6
enough 0 434 6
to 0 434 6
swallow 0 434 6
and 0 434 6
entire 0 434 6
continent 0 434 6
here 0 434 6
on 0 434 6
Earth 0 434 6
— 0 434 6
so 0 434 6
watching 0 434 6
one 0 434 6
breathe 1 434 6
its 1 434 6
dying 1 434 6
gasps 1 434 6
is 0 434 6
still 0 434 6
a 0 434 6
special 0 434 6
sight. 0 434 6

The 0 434 7
planet, 0 434 7
which 0 434 7
NASA 0 434 7
says 0 434 7

the 0 434 7
windiest 0 434 7

large 0 434 7
spots 0 434 7
on 0 434 7
its 0 434 7
surface, 0 434 7
but 0 434 7
scientists 0 434 7
are 0 434 7
still 0 434 7
at 0 434 7
a 0 434 7
loss 0 434 7
as 0 434 7
to 0 434 7
how 0 434 7
they 0 434 7
actually 0 434 7
occur. 0 434 7

“We 0 434 8
have 0 434 8
no 0 434 8
evidence 0 434 8
of 0 434 8
how 0 434 8
these 0 434 8
vortices 0 434 8
are 0 434 8
formed 0 434 8
or 0 434 8
how 0 434 8
fast 0 434 8
they 0 434 8
rotate,” 0 434 8
Agustín 0 434 8
Sánchez-Lavega 0 434 8
of 0 434 8
the 0 434 8
University 0 434 8

the 0 434 8
Basque 0 434 8
Country 0 434 8
in 0 434 8
Spain 0 434 8
explains. 0 434 8

“It 0 434 9
is 0 434 9
most 0 434 9
likely 0 434 9
that 0 434 9
they 0 434 9
arise 0 434 9
from 0 434 9
an 0 434 9
instability 0 434 9
in 0 434 9
the 0 434 9

and 0 434 9
westward 0 434 9

The 0 434 10
observation 0 434 10
of 0 434 10
this 0 434 10
particular 0 434 10
storm 0 434 10
dying 0 434 10
out 0 434 10
is 0 434 10
significant 0 434 10
because 0 434 10
it’s 0 434 10
the 0 434 10
very 0 434 10
first 0 434 10
time 0 434 10
one 0 434 10
of 0 434 10
Neptune’s 0 434 10
storms 0 434 10
has 0 434 10
been 0 434 10
observed 0 434 10
in 0 434 10
such 0 434 10
a 0 434 10
way. 0 434 10

It 0 434 11
also 0 434 11
goes 0 434 11
against 0 434 11
everything 0 434 11
that 0 434 11
scientists 0 434 11
thought 0 434 11
they 0 434 11
knew 0 434 11
about 0 434 11
how 0 434 11
forms 0 434 11
on 0 434 11
Neptune 0 434 11
live 0 434 11
and 0 434 11
die. 0 434 11

“It 0 434 12
looks 0 434 12
like 0 434 12
we’re 0 434 12
capturing 0 434 12
the 0 434 12
demise 0 434 12
of 0 434 12
this 0 434 12
dark 0 434 12
vortex, 0 434 12
and 0 434 12
it’s 0 434 12
different 0 434 12
from 0 434 12
what 0 434 12
well-known 0 434 12
studies 0 434 12
led 0 434 12
us 0 434 12
to 0 434 12
expect,” 0 434 12

of 0 434 12
California 0 434 12

Berkeley 0 434 12
says. 0 434 12

“Their 0 434 13
dynamical 0 434 13
simulations 0 434 13
said 0 434 13
that 0 434 13
anticyclones 0 434 13
under 0 434 13
Neptune’s 0 434 13
wind 0 434 13
shear 0 434 13
would 0 434 13
probably 0 434 13
drift 0 434 13
toward 0 434 13
the 0 434 13
equator. 0 434 13

We 0 434 14
thought 0 434 14
that 0 434 14
once 0 434 14
the 0 434 14
vortex 0 434 14
got 0 434 14
too 0 434 14
close 0 434 14
to 0 434 14
the 0 434 14
equator, 0 434 14
it 0 434 14
would 0 434 14
break 0 434 14
up 0 434 14

perhaps 0 434 14
create 0 434 14

So 0 438 17
which 0 438 17
is 0 438 17
it? 0 438 17

Does 0 438 18
Ramadan 0 438 18
remind 0 438 18
us 0 438 18
of 0 438 18
“the 0 438 18
richness 0 438 18
Muslims 0 438 18
add 0 438 18
to 0 438 18
the 1 438 18
religious 1 438 18
tapestry 1 438 18
of 1 438 18
American 1 438 18
life,” 1 438 18
or 0 438 18
is 0 438 18
Ramadan 0 438 18
“a 0 438 18
month 0 438 18
of 0 438 18
calamity 0 438 18
everywhere 0 438 18
for 0 438 18
nonbelievers”? 0 438 18

Islam’s 1 438 19
core 1 438 19
beliefs 1 438 19
make 1 438 19
it 1 438 19
clear 1 438 19
that 1 438 19
the 1 438 19
latter 1 438 19
statement 1 438 19
is 1 438 19
closer 1 438 19
to 1 438 19
the 1 438 19
truth. 1 438 19

During 0 438 20
Ramadan, 0 438 20
Muslims 0 438 20
are 0 438 20
exhorted 0 438 20
to 0 438 20
renew 0 438 20
and 0 438 20
deepen 0 438 20
their 0 438 20
devotion 0 438 20
to 0 438 20
Allah. 0 438 20

Hence 0 438 21
it 0 438 21
is 0 438 21
a 0 438 21
time 0 438 21
when 0 438 21
they’re 0 438 21
supposed 0 438 21
to 0 438 21
grow 0 438 21
more 0 438 21
generous 0 438 21
and 0 438 21
kind 0 438 21
toward 0 438 21
their 0 438 21
fellow 0 438 21
Muslims. 0 438 21

However, 0 438 22
the 0 438 22
Qur’an 0 438 22
says: 0 438 22
“Muhammad 0 438 22
is 0 438 22
the 0 438 22
Messenger 0 438 22
of 0 438 22
Allah, 0 438 22
and 0 438 22
those 0 438 22
who 0 438 22
are 0 438 22
with 0 438 22
him 0 438 22
are 0 438 22
severe 1 438 22
against 1 438 22
disbelievers, 0 438 22
and 0 438 22
merciful 0 438 22
among 0 438 22
themselves” 0 438 22
(48:29). 0 438 22

If 0 438 23
the 0 438 23
Ramadan 0 438 23
imperative 0 438 23
is 0 438 23
to 0 438 23
become 0 438 23
more 0 438 23
devout, 0 438 23
the 0 438 23
Muslim 0 438 23
who 0 438 23
applies 0 438 23
himself 0 438 23
diligently 0 438 23
to 0 438 23
the 0 438 23
Ramadan 0 438 23
observance 0 438 23
will 0 438 23
simultaneously 0 438 23
become 0 438 23
more 0 438 23
both 0 438 23
merciful 0 438 23
to 0 438 23
his 0 438 23
fellow 0 438 23
Muslims 0 438 23
and 0 438 23
more 1 438 23
severe 1 438 23
against 1 438 23
the 0 438 23
unbelievers. 0 438 23

Murdering 1 438 24
infidels 1 438 24
thus 1 438 24
doesn’t 1 438 24
contradict 1 438 24
the 1 438 24
spirit 1 438 24
of 1 438 24
Ramadan; 1 438 24
it 1 438 24
embodies 1 438 24
it. 1 438 24

time 0 438 25
for 0 438 25

against 0 438 25
infidels 1 438 25
went 0 438 25
back 0 438 25
to 0 438 25
Muhammad’s 0 438 25
time: 0 438 25
“The 0 438 25
month 0 438 25
of 0 438 25
Ramadan 0 438 25
in 0 438 25
the 0 438 25

of 0 438 25

(pbuh) 0 438 25
and 0 438 25
the 0 438 25
righteous 0 438 25
ancestors 0 438 25
was 0 438 25
a 0 438 25
month 0 438 25
of 0 438 25
forthcoming. 0 438 25

The 0 438 26
greatest 0 438 26
battles 0 438 26
during 0 438 26
the 0 438 26
lifetime 0 438 26
of 0 438 26
the 0 438 26
Prophet 0 438 26
(pbuh) 0 438 26
occurred 0 438 26
in 0 438 26
this 1 438 26
blessed 1 438 26
month, 1 438 26
the 1 438 26
month 1 438 26
of 1 438 26
jihad, 1 438 26
zeal 0 438 26
and 0 438 26
enthusiasm.” 0 438 26

Trump 0 438 27
was, 0 438 27
unfortunately, 0 438 27
following 0 438 27
the 0 438 27
example 0 438 27
of 0 438 27
his 0 438 27
two 0 438 27
immediate 0 438 27
predecessors 0 438 27
when 0 438 27
he 0 438 27
claimed 0 438 27
that 0 438 27
“Ramadan 0 438 27
reminds 0 438 27
us 0 438 27
of 0 438 27
the 0 438 27
richness 0 438 27
Muslims 0 438 27
add 0 438 27
to 1 438 27
the 1 438 27
religious 1 438 27
tapestry 1 438 27
of 1 438 27
American 1 438 27
life,” 1 438 27
and 0 438 27
was 0 438 27
severely 1 438 27
misleading 1 438 27
the 1 438 27
American 1 438 27
people. 1 438 27

Ironically, 0 438 28
even 0 438 28
in 0 438 28
doing 0 438 28
this 0 438 28
he 0 438 28
is 0 438 28
likely 0 438 28
to 0 438 28
fail 0 438 28
to 0 438 28
satisfy 0 438 28
Muslims, 0 438 28
or 0 438 28
anyone. 0 438 28

After 0 438 29
all, 0 438 29
after 0 438 29
the 0 438 29
Trump 0 438 29
White 0 438 29
House 0 438 29
issued 0 438 29
a 0 438 29
similar 0 438 29
statement 0 438 29
last 0 438 29
year, 0 438 29
the 0 438 29
Washington 0 438 29
Post 0 438 29
ran 0 438 29
a 0 438 29
lengthy 0 438 29
piece 0 438 29
in 0 438 29
which 0 438 29
several 0 438 29
Muslims 0 438 29
explained 0 438 29
why 0 438 29
the 0 438 29
statement 0 438 29
was 0 438 29
unsatisfactory 0 438 29
to 0 438 29
them. 0 438 29

Shadi 0 438 30
Hamid 0 438 30
of 0 438 30
the 0 438 30
Qatar-funded 0 438 30
Brookings 0 438 30
Institution 0 438 30
declared: 0 438 30
“Trump 1 438 30
has 1 438 30
so 1 438 30
rarely 1 438 30
recognized 1 438 30
that 1 438 30
American 1 438 30
Muslims 1 438 30
even 1 438 30
exist, 1 438 30
but 1 438 30
this 1 438 30
offers 1 438 30
apparent 1 438 30
proof 1 438 30
that 1 438 30
he 1 438 30
is 1 438 30
aware 1 438 30
of 1 438 30
our 1 438 30
existence. 1 438 30

Great! 1 438 31

Putting 0 438 32
all 0 438 32
that 0 438 32
context 0 438 32
aside, 0 438 32
it’s 0 438 32
offensive 0 438 32
and 0 438 32
pretty 1 438 32
much 1 438 32
terrible.” 1 438 32

Why? 0 438 33

Because 0 438 34
Trump 0 438 34
had 0 438 34
the 0 438 34
temerity 0 438 34
to 0 438 34
mention 0 438 34
jihad 0 438 34
terrorism. 0 438 34

Hamid 0 438 35
continued: 0 438 35
“We, 0 438 35
as 0 438 35
American 0 438 35
Muslims, 0 438 35
shouldn’t 0 438 35
be 0 438 35
defined 0 438 35
solely 0 438 35
in 0 438 35
our 0 438 35
relationship 0 438 35
to 0 438 35
bad 0 438 35
things 0 438 35
that 0 438 35
we 0 438 35
have 0 438 35
nothing 0 438 35
to 0 438 35
do 0 438 35
with. 0 438 35

We’re 0 438 36
also 0 438 36
normal 0 438 36
people 0 438 36
who 0 438 36
happen 0 438 36
to 0 438 36
be 0 438 36
Muslim 0 438 36
and 0 438 36
to 0 438 36
see 0 438 36
us 0 438 36
and 0 438 36
our 0 438 36
history 0 438 36
in 0 438 36
America 0 438 36
so 0 438 36
narrowly 0 438 36
is 0 438 36
plain 1 438 36
out 1 438 36
offensive.” 1 438 36

What 1 438 37
is 1 438 37
actually 1 438 37
offensive 1 438 37
is 1 438 37
that 1 438 37
Hamid 1 438 37
would 1 438 37
try 1 438 37
in 1 438 37
this 1 438 37
way 1 438 37
to 1 438 37
absolve 1 438 37
the 1 438 37
Muslim 1 438 37
community 1 438 37
of 1 438 37
any 1 438 37
responsibility 1 438 37
to 1 438 37
root 1 438 37
out 1 438 37
jihad 1 438 37
terrorist 1 438 37
from 1 438 37
its 1 438 37
midst. 1 438 37

There 0 438 38
is 0 438 38
certain 0 438 38
to 0 438 38
be 0 438 38
more 0 438 38
jihad 0 438 38
terrorism 0 438 38
during 0 438 38
this 0 438 38
Ramadan, 0 438 38
and 0 438 38
some 0 438 38
of 0 438 38
it 0 438 38
may 0 438 38
be 0 438 38
committed 0 438 38
by 0 438 38
Muslims 0 438 38
in 0 438 38
the 0 438 38
U.S. 0 438 38
Hamid, 1 438 38
if 1 438 38
he 1 438 38
cared 1 438 38
about 1 438 38
this, 1 438 38
would 1 438 38
be 1 438 38
confronting 1 438 38
honestly 1 438 38
the 1 438 38
teachings 1 438 38
of 1 438 38
Islam 1 438 38
that 1 438 38
make 1 438 38
Ramadan 1 438 38
the 1 438 38
month 1 438 38
of 1 438 38
jihad, 1 438 38
and 1 438 38
working 1 438 38
to 1 438 38
reform 1 438 38
them. 1 438 38

Meanwhile, 0 438 39
it 1 438 39
would 1 438 39
be 1 438 39
dangerous, 1 438 39
suicidal 1 438 39
folly 1 438 39
for 1 438 39
Infidels 1 438 39
to 1 438 39
pretend 1 438 39
that 1 438 39
Ramadan 1 438 39
is 1 438 39
not 1 438 39
the 1 438 39
month 1 438 39
of 1 438 39
jihad. 1 438 39

And 1 438 40
as 1 438 40
our 1 438 40
Ramadan 1 438 40
willful 1 438 40
blindness 1 438 40
continues, 1 438 40
more 1 438 40
Infidels 1 438 40
will 1 438 40
die. 1 438 40

Trump’s 0 439 4

Why? 0 439 5

Because, 0 439 6
when 0 439 6
Trump’s 0 439 6
Russia 0 439 6
policies 0 439 6
are 0 439 6

Obama’s… 0 439 6
it 0 439 6
becomes 0 439 6
CLEAR 0 439 6
that 0 439 6
Trump 1 439 6
has 1 439 6
obviously 1 439 6
been 1 439 6
tougher 1 439 6

Here’s 0 439 18
the 0 439 18
crux 0 439 18
of 0 439 18
Greenwald’s 0 439 18
argument: 0 439 18

So 0 439 19
let 0 439 19
me 0 439 19
just 0 439 19
make 0 439 19
two 0 439 19
points. 0 439 19

Number 0 439 20
one 0 439 20
is, 0 439 20
if 0 439 20
you 0 439 20
look 0 439 20
at 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Obama 0 439 20
versus 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Trump, 0 439 20
there’s 0 439 20
no 0 439 20
question 0 439 20
that 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Obama 0 439 20
was 0 439 20
more 0 439 20
cooperative 0 439 20
with 0 439 20
and 0 439 20
collaborative 0 439 20
with 0 439 20
Russia 0 439 20
and 0 439 20
the 0 439 20
Russian 0 439 20
agenda 0 439 20
than 0 439 20
President 0 439 20
Trump. 0 439 20

President 0 439 21
Trump 0 439 21
has 0 439 21
sent 0 439 21
lethal 1 439 21
arms 0 439 21
to 0 439 21
Ukraine—a 0 439 21
crucial 0 439 21
issue 0 439 21
for 0 439 21
Putin—which 0 439 21
President 0 439 21
Obama 0 439 21
refused 0 439 21
to 0 439 21
do. 0 439 21

President 0 439 22
Trump 0 439 22
has 0 439 22
bombed 0 439 22
the 0 439 22
Assad 0 439 22
forces 0 439 22
in 0 439 22
Syria, 0 439 22
a 0 439 22
client 0 439 22
state 0 439 22
of 0 439 22
Putin, 0 439 22
something 0 439 22
that 0 439 22
Obama 0 439 22
refused 0 439 22
to 0 439 22
do 0 439 22
because 0 439 22
he 0 439 22
didn’t 0 439 22
want 0 439 22
to 0 439 22
provoke 0 439 22
Putin. 0 439 22

Trump 0 439 23
has 0 439 23
expelled 0 439 23
more 1 439 23
Russian 0 439 23
diplomats 0 439 23
and 0 439 23
sanctioned 0 439 23
more 1 439 23
Russian 0 439 23
oligarchs 0 439 23
than 0 439 23
[Obama] 0 439 23
has. 0 439 23

Trump 0 439 24
undid 0 439 24
the 0 439 24
Iran 0 439 24
deal, 0 439 24
which 0 439 24
Russia 0 439 24
favored, 0 439 24
while 0 439 24
Obama 0 439 24
worked 0 439 24
with 0 439 24
Russia 0 439 24
in 0 439 24
order 0 439 24
to 0 439 24
do 0 439 24
the 0 439 24
Iran 0 439 24
deal. 0 439 24

So 0 439 25
this 0 439 25
idea 0 439 25
that 0 439 25
Trump 0 439 25
is 0 439 25
some 0 439 25
kind 0 439 25
of 0 439 25
a 0 439 25
puppet 1 439 25
of 0 439 25
Putin, 0 439 25
that 0 439 25
he 0 439 25
controls 0 439 25
him 0 439 25
with 0 439 25
blackmail, 0 439 25
is 0 439 25
the 0 439 25
kind 0 439 25
of 0 439 25
stuff 0 439 25
that 0 439 25
you 0 439 25
believe 0 439 25
if 0 439 25
you 0 439 25
read 0 439 25
too 0 439 25
many 0 439 25

Tom 0 439 26
Clancy 0 439 26
novels 0 439 26
but 0 439 26
isn’t 0 439 26
borne 0 439 26
out 0 439 26
by 0 439 26
the 0 439 26
facts. 0 439 26

The 0 439 27
other 0 439 27
issue 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
I 0 439 27
want 0 439 27
to 0 439 27
make 0 439 27
is 0 439 27
that, 0 439 27
you 0 439 27
know, 0 439 27
again, 0 439 27
this 0 439 27
idea 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
somehow 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
you 0 439 27
are 0 439 27
endorsing 0 439 27
the 0 439 27
repression 0 439 27
of 0 439 27
other 0 439 27
countries’ 0 439 27
leaders 0 439 27
if 0 439 27
you 0 439 27
meet 0 439 27
with 0 439 27
them—it 0 439 27
is 0 439 27
true 0 439 27
that 0 439 27
Trump 0 439 27
has 0 439 27
never 0 439 27
criticized 0 439 27
Putin, 0 439 27
although 0 439 27
he 0 439 27
has 0 439 27
taken 0 439 27
all 0 439 27
the 0 439 27
steps 0 439 27
I 0 439 27
just 0 439 27
outlined 0 439 27
against 0 439 27
Putin. 0 439 27

But 0 439 28
he’s 0 439 28
also 0 439 28
never 1 439 28
criticized 0 439 28
Benjamin 0 439 28
Netanyahu. 0 439 28

He’s 0 439 29
also 0 439 29
never 1 439 29
criticized 0 439 29
the 0 439 29
incredibly 1 439 29
repressive 1 439 29
leaders 0 439 29
of 0 439 29
Saudi 0 439 29
Arabia. 0 439 29

He’s 0 439 30
never 1 439 30
criticized 0 439 30
the 0 439 30
fascist 1 439 30
president 0 439 30
of 0 439 30
the 0 439 30
Philippines. 0 439 30

It 0 439 31
is 0 439 31
true 0 439 31
President 0 439 31
Trump 0 439 31
likes 0 439 31
fascist 0 439 31
and 0 439 31
authoritarian 0 439 31
leaders, 0 439 31
and 0 439 31
that 0 439 31
is 0 439 31
a 0 439 31
problem, 0 439 31
but 0 439 31
it’s 0 439 31
not 0 439 31
like 0 439 31
Putin 0 439 31
is 0 439 31
the 0 439 31
only 0 439 31
leader 0 439 31
that 0 439 31
he 0 439 31
doesn’t 0 439 31
criticize. 0 439 31

The 0 439 32
relevant 0 439 32
portion 0 439 32
of 0 439 32
the 0 439 32
debate 0 439 32
begins 0 439 32
about 0 439 32

The 0 441 1
bubonic 0 441 1
plague 0 441 1
outbreak 0 441 1
that 0 441 1
is 0 441 1
taking 0 441 1
Madagascar 0 441 1
to 0 441 1
its 0 441 1

than 0 441 1
likely 0 441 1
last 0 441 1
another 0 441 1
six 0 441 1
months. 0 441 1

But 0 441 2
the 0 441 2
worst 0 441 2
news 0 441 2
is 0 441 2
that 0 441 2
the 1 441 2
epidemic 1 441 2
could 1 441 2
explode 1 441 2
anytime 1 441 2
unleashing 1 441 2
the 1 441 2
sickness 1 441 2
on 1 441 2
the 1 441 2
globe. 1 441 2

At 0 441 3
least 0 441 3
128 0 441 3
people 0 441 3
have 0 441 3
been 0 441 3
killed 0 441 3
and 0 441 3
more 0 441 3
than 0 441 3
1,300 0 441 3
infected 0 441 3
by 0 441 3
the 0 441 3
deadlier 0 441 3
pneumonic 0 441 3
strain 0 441 3
of 0 441 3
the 0 441 3
medieval 0 441 3
disease. 0 441 3

But 0 441 4
the 0 441 4
oncoming 0 441 4
rainy 0 441 4
season 0 441 4
could 0 441 4
see 0 441 4
the 0 441 4
number 0 441 4
of 0 441 4
those 0 441 4
infected 0 441 4
explode 1 441 4
exponentially. 0 441 4

The 0 441 5
rainy 0 441 5
season 0 441 5
poses 0 441 5
a 0 441 5
threat 0 441 5
to 0 441 5
the 0 441 5
containment 0 441 5
of 0 441 5
the 0 441 5
plague 0 441 5
because 0 441 5
outbreaks 0 441 5
of 0 441 5
this 0 441 5
magnitude 0 441 5
often 0 441 5
seem 0 441 5
to 0 441 5
be 0 441 5
seasonal. 0 441 5

The 0 441 6
Foreign 0 441 6
Office 0 441 6
recently 0 441 6
warned 0 441 6
that 0 441 6
the 1 441 6
deadly 1 441 6
outbreak 1 441 6
is 1 441 6
entering 1 441 6
its 1 441 6
most 1 441 6
dangerous 1 441 6
phase. 1 441 6

Its 0 441 7
website 0 441 7
said 0 441 7
that 0 441 7
“outbreaks 0 441 7
of 0 441 7
plague 0 441 7
tend 0 441 7
to 0 441 7
be 0 441 7
seasonal 0 441 7
and 0 441 7
occur 0 441 7
mainly 0 441 7
during 0 441 7
the 0 441 7
rainy 0 441 7
season.” 0 441 7
The 0 441 7
African 0 441 7
island’s 0 441 7
wet 0 441 7
season 0 441 7
officially 0 441 7
began 0 441 7
today 0 441 7
and 0 441 7
will 0 441 7
last 0 441 7
until 0 441 7
the 0 441 7
end 0 441 7
of 0 441 7
April, 0 441 7
meaning 0 441 7
the 1 441 7
downward 1 441 7
trend 1 441 7
the 1 441 7
plague 1 441 7
had 1 441 7
seen 1 441 7
over 1 441 7
the 1 441 7
past 1 441 7
few 1 441 7
days, 1 441 7
will 1 441 7
likely 1 441 7
turn 1 441 7
upward 1 441 7
again. 1 441 7

Because 0 441 8
the 0 441 8
disease 0 441 8
can 0 441 8
be 0 441 8
spread 0 441 8
easily 0 441 8
through 0 441 8
a 0 441 8
cough 0 441 8
or 0 441 8
sneeze, 0 441 8
experts 0 441 8
are 0 441 8
fearful. 0 441 8

It 1 441 9
would 1 441 9
take 1 441 9
just 1 441 9
one 1 441 9
infected 1 441 9
traveler 0 441 9
who 0 441 9
made 0 441 9
it 0 441 9
to 0 441 9
Africa’s 0 441 9
mainland 0 441 9
or 0 441 9
even 0 441 9
nearby 0 441 9
British 0 441 9
honeymoon 0 441 9
paradises 0 441 9
like 0 441 9
Mauritius, 0 441 9
the 0 441 9
Maldives 0 441 9
or 0 441 9
the 0 441 9
Seychelles 0 441 9
to 0 441 9
spread 0 441 9
the 0 441 9
disease 0 441 9
globally. 0 441 9

The 0 441 10
Seychelles 0 441 10
is 0 441 10
currently 0 441 10
putting 0 441 10
anyone 0 441 10
traveling 0 441 10
from 0 441 10
Madagascar 0 441 10
into 0 441 10
quarantine 0 441 10
on 0 441 10
arrival 0 441 10
as 0 441 10
a 0 441 10
precaution. 0 441 10

The 1 441 11
outbreak 1 441 11
has 1 441 11
been 1 441 11
fueled 1 441 11
by 1 441 11
performing 1 441 11
the 1 441 11
ancient 1 441 11
practice 1 441 11
of 1 441 11
Famadihana. 1 441 11

Famadihana 0 441 12
is 0 441 12
the 0 441 12
“dancing 0 441 12
with 0 441 12
the 0 441 12
dead” 0 441 12
ritual 0 441 12
which 0 441 12
sees 0 441 12
locals 0 441 12
dig 0 441 12
up 0 441 12
deceased 0 441 12
relatives 0 441 12

is 0 442 27
as 0 442 27

commitment 0 442 27
to 0 442 27

When 0 442 27
Harold 0 442 27

the 0 442 27
Nobel 0 442 27

for 0 442 27
Literature 0 442 27
in 0 442 27
2005, 0 442 27
he 0 442 27
referred 0 442 27
to 0 442 27
‘a 0 442 27

He 0 442 27
asked 0 442 27
why 1 442 27
‘the 1 442 27

America’s 1 442 27

“never 1 442 27

if? 0 442 28

In 0 442 29

out 0 442 29
that 0 442 29
— 0 442 29
If 0 442 29
WikiLeaks 0 442 29
had 0 442 29
been 0 442 29
up 0 442 29

frustrated 1 442 29

have 0 442 29

that 0 442 29
their 0 442 29
superiors 0 442 29
bottled 0 442 29
up, 0 442 29
perhaps 0 442 29
averting 0 442 29
the 0 442 29
terrorism 0 442 29
attacks. 0 442 29

“There 0 442 30
were 0 442 30
a 0 442 30
lot 0 442 30
of 0 442 30

in 0 442 30

2010, 0 442 34

he 0 442 34
was 0 442 34
still 0 442 34
a 0 442 34

Sam 0 442 34

its 0 442 34
annual 0 442 34

to 0 442 34

The 0 442 35
citation 0 442 35
read: 0 442 35

“It 0 442 36
seems 0 442 36
altogether 0 442 36
fitting 0 442 36
and 0 442 36
proper 0 442 36
that 0 442 36
this 0 442 36
year’s 0 442 36
award 0 442 36
be 0 442 36
presented 0 442 36
in 0 442 36
London, 0 442 36
where 0 442 36
Edmund 0 442 36
Burke 0 442 36
coined 0 442 36
the 0 442 36
expression 0 442 36
“Fourth 0 442 36
Estate.” 0 442 36
Comparing 0 442 36
the 0 442 36
function 0 442 36
of 0 442 36
the 0 442 36
press 0 442 36

Houses 0 442 36
then 0 442 36
in 0 442 36
Parliament, 0 442 36
Burke 0 442 36
said: 0 442 36

The 0 442 36
year 0 442 36
was 0 442 36
1787—the 0 442 36
year 0 442 36
the 0 442 36
U.S. 0 442 36
Constitution 0 442 36
was 0 442 36
adopted. 0 442 36

The 0 442 37
First 0 442 37
Amendment, 0 442 37
approved 0 442 37
four 0 442 37
years 0 442 37
later, 0 442 37
aimed 0 442 37
at 0 442 37
ensuring 0 442 37
that 0 442 37
the 0 442 37
press 0 442 37
would 0 442 37
be 0 442 37
free 0 442 37
of 0 442 37
government 0 442 37
interference. 0 442 37

That 0 442 38
was 0 442 38
then. 0 442 38

With 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
Fourth 1 442 39
Estate 1 442 39
now 1 442 39
on 1 442 39
life 1 442 39

there 0 442 39
is 0 442 39
a 0 442 39
high 0 442 39
premium 0 442 39
on 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
fledgling 0 442 39
Fifth 0 442 39
Estate, 0 442 39
which 0 442 39
uses 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
ether 0 442 39
and 0 442 39
is 0 442 39
not 0 442 39
susceptible 0 442 39
of 0 442 39
government 0 442 39
or 0 442 39
corporation 0 442 39
control. 0 442 39

Small 1 442 40
wonder 1 442 40
that 0 442 40
governments 0 442 40
with 0 442 40
lots 0 442 40
to 0 442 40
hide 0 442 40
feel 0 442 40
very 0 442 40
threatened. 0 442 40

It 0 442 41
has 0 442 41
been 0 442 41
said: 0 442 41
“You 0 442 41
shall 0 442 41
know 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
truth, 0 442 41
and 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
truth 0 442 41
shall 0 442 41
set 0 442 41
you 0 442 41
free.” 0 442 41
WikiLeaks 0 442 41
is 0 442 41
helping 0 442 41
make 0 442 41
that 0 442 41
possible 0 442 41
by 0 442 41
publishing 0 442 41
documents 0 442 41
that 0 442 41
do 0 442 41
not 0 442 41
lie. 0 442 41

Last 0 442 42
spring, 0 442 42
when 0 442 42
we 0 442 42
chose 0 442 42
WikiLeaks 0 442 42
and 0 442 42
Julian 0 442 42
Assange 0 442 42
for 0 442 42
this 0 442 42
award, 0 442 42
Julian 0 442 42
said 0 442 42
he 0 442 42
would 0 442 42
accept 0 442 42
only 0 442 42
“on 0 442 42
behalf 0 442 42
or 0 442 42
our 0 442 42
sources, 0 442 42
without 0 442 42
which 0 442 42
WikiLeaks’ 0 442 42

are 0 442 42
of 0 442 42
no 0 442 42
significance.” 0 442 42
We 0 442 42
do 0 442 42
not 0 442 42
know 0 442 42
if 0 442 42
Pvt. 0 442 42

Bradley 0 442 43
Manning 0 442 43
gave 0 442 43
WikiLeaks 0 442 43
the 0 442 43
gun-barrel 0 442 43
video 0 442 43
of 0 442 43
July 0 442 43
12, 0 442 43
2007 0 442 43
called 0 442 43
“Collateral 0 442 43
Murder.” 0 442 43
Whoever 0 442 43
did 0 442 43
provide 0 442 43
that 0 442 43
graphic 0 442 43
footage, 0 442 43
showing 0 442 43
the 1 442 43
brutality 1 442 43
of 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
celebrated 1 442 43
“surge” 1 442 43
in 1 442 43
Iraq, 1 442 43
was 0 442 43
certainly 0 442 43
far 1 442 43
more 1 442 43
a 1 442 43
patriot 1 442 43
than 0 442 43
the 1 442 43
“mainstream” 1 442 43
journalist 1 442 43
embedded 0 442 43
in 0 442 43
that 0 442 43
same 0 442 43
Army 0 442 43
unit. 0 442 43

He 0 442 44
suppressed 0 442 44
what 0 442 44
happened 0 442 44
in 0 442 44
Baghdad 0 442 44
that 0 442 44
day, 0 442 44
dismissed 0 442 44
it 0 442 44
as 0 442 44
simply 0 442 44
“one 1 442 44
bad 1 442 44
day 1 442 44
in 1 442 44
a 1 442 44
surge 1 442 44
that 1 442 44
was 1 442 44
filled 1 442 44
with 1 442 44
such 1 442 44
days,” 1 442 44
and 0 442 44
then 0 442 44
had 1 442 44
the 1 442 44
temerity 1 442 44
to 1 442 44
lavish 1 442 44
praise 1 442 44
on 0 442 44
the 0 442 44
unit 0 442 44
in 0 442 44
a 0 442 44
book 0 442 44
he 0 442 44
called 0 442 44
“The 0 442 44
Good 0 442 44
Soldiers.” 0 442 44
Julian 0 442 44
is 0 442 44
right 0 442 44
to 0 442 44
emphasize 0 442 44
that 0 442 44
the 0 442 44
world 0 442 44
is 0 442 44
deeply 0 442 44
indebted 0 442 44
to 0 442 44
patriotic 1 442 44
truth-tellers 1 442 44
like 0 442 44
the 0 442 44
sources 0 442 44
who 0 442 44
provided 0 442 44
the 0 442 44
gun-barrel 0 442 44
footage 0 442 44
and 0 442 44
the 0 442 44
many 0 442 44
documents 0 442 44
on 0 442 44
Afghanistan 0 442 44
and 0 442 44
Iraq 0 442 44
to 0 442 44
WikiLeaks. 0 442 44

We 0 442 45
hope 0 442 45
to 0 442 45
have 0 442 45
a 0 442 45
chance 0 442 45
to 0 442 45
honor 0 442 45
them 0 442 45
in 0 442 45
person 0 442 45
in 0 442 45
the 0 442 45
future. 0 442 45

Today 0 442 46
we 0 442 46
honor 0 442 46
WikiLeaks, 0 442 46
and 0 442 46
one 0 442 46
of 0 442 46
its 0 442 46
leaders, 0 442 46
Julian 0 442 46
Assange, 0 442 46
for 0 442 46
their 0 442 46
ingenuity 0 442 46
in 0 442 46
creating 0 442 46
a 0 442 46
new 0 442 46
highway 0 442 46
by 0 442 46
which 0 442 46
important 0 442 46
documentary 0 442 46
evidence 0 442 46
can 0 442 46
make 0 442 46
its 0 442 46
way, 0 442 46
quickly 0 442 46
and 0 442 46
confidentially, 0 442 46
through 0 442 46
the 0 442 46
ether 0 442 46
and 0 442 46
into 0 442 46
our 0 442 46
in-boxes. 0 442 46

Long 1 442 47
live 1 442 47
the 1 442 47
Fifth 1 442 47
Estate!” 1 442 47

Eventually 0 442 48
a 0 442 48
compromise 0 442 48
was 0 442 48
found 0 442 48
in 0 442 48

next 0 443 2
day 0 443 2
the 0 443 2
Iranian 0 443 2

President 0 443 3

has 0 443 3
called 0 443 3
the 0 443 3
Iranian 0 443 3

with 0 443 3

announcement 0 443 3

that 0 443 3

just 0 443 3
that. 0 443 3

IRGC 0 443 4
as 0 443 4
a 0 443 4
terrorist 0 443 4

new 0 443 4

for 0 443 4
its 0 443 4
aggressive 0 443 4
actions 0 443 4
in 0 443 4
the 0 443 4
region 0 443 4
is 0 443 4
not 0 443 4
a 0 443 4
restoration 0 443 4
of 0 443 4
the 0 443 4
sanctions 0 443 4
lifted 0 443 4
by 0 443 4
the 0 443 4
Obama 0 443 4
administration 0 443 4
as 0 443 4
part 0 443 4
of 0 443 4

disastrous 0 443 4
nuclear 0 443 4
deal 0 443 4
with 0 443 4
Iran. 0 443 4

If 0 443 5
Iran 0 443 5
insists 0 443 5
it 0 443 5
can 0 443 5
do 0 443 5
what 0 443 5
it 0 443 5
wants 0 443 5
militarily 0 443 5
in 0 443 5
terms 0 443 5

without 0 443 5
violating 0 443 5

then 0 443 5
the 0 443 5
United 0 443 5
States 0 443 5
can 0 443 5
certainly 0 443 5
act 0 443 5
to 0 443 5
curb 0 443 5
such 0 443 5
activities 0 443 5

pressure. 0 443 5

The 0 443 6
U.S. 0 443 6
can 0 443 6

sanctions 0 443 6
against 0 443 6
the 0 443 6
Iranian 0 443 6
regime’s 0 443 6
principal 0 443 6
instrument 0 443 6
for 0 443 6
projecting 0 443 6
aggressive, 0 443 6
destabilizing 0 443 6
force 0 443 6
outside 0 443 6

without 0 443 6
violating 0 443 6
the 0 443 6
nuclear 0 443 6
deal. 0 443 6

The 0 443 7
Iranian 0 443 7
regime 0 443 7
does 0 443 7
not 0 443 7
see 0 443 7
it 0 443 7
that 0 443 7
way, 0 443 7
however. 0 443 7

With 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
lifting 0 443 8
of 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
nuclear-related 0 443 8
sanctions 0 443 8
making 0 443 8
available 0 443 8
billions 0 443 8
of 0 443 8
dollars 0 443 8
to 0 443 8
Iran’s 0 443 8
leaders 0 443 8
to 0 443 8
further 0 443 8
finance 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
IRGC’s 0 443 8
exploits 0 443 8
in 0 443 8
Iraq, 0 443 8
Syria, 0 443 8
Lebanon, 0 443 8
Yemen 0 443 8
and 0 443 8
elsewhere, 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
regime 0 443 8
is 0 443 8
furious 0 443 8
that 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
Trump 0 443 8
administration 0 443 8
is 0 443 8
tightening 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
financial 0 443 8
screws 0 443 8
again, 0 443 8
even 0 443 8
if 0 443 8
for 0 443 8
reasons 0 443 8
not 0 443 8
directly 0 443 8
related 0 443 8
to 0 443 8
Iran’s 0 443 8
compliance 0 443 8
with 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
terms 0 443 8
of 0 443 8
the 0 443 8
nuclear 0 443 8
deal. 0 443 8

Thus, 1 443 9
it 1 443 9
is 1 443 9
threatening 1 443 9
U.S. 1 443 9
forces 1 443 9
and 1 443 9
bases 1 443 9
in 1 443 9

unrelated 0 443 10
events 0 443 10
this 0 443 10
past 0 443 10
week 0 443 10
point 1 443 10
to 1 443 10
Iran’s 1 443 10
positioning 1 443 10
itself 1 443 10
for 1 443 10
more 1 443 10
aggressive 1 443 10
military 1 443 10
actions 1 443 10
that 1 443 10
could 1 443 10
place 1 443 10
U.S. 1 443 10
forces 1 443 10
in 1 443 10
harm’s 1 443 10
way. 1 443 10

On 0 443 11
Tuesday, 0 443 11
Major 0 443 11
General 0 443 11
Bagheri 0 443 11
landed 0 443 11
in 0 443 11
Damascus 0 443 11
for 0 443 11
talks 0 443 11
with 0 443 11
Syrian 0 443 11
President 0 443 11
Bashar 0 443 11
Assad 0 443 11
and 0 443 11
senior 0 443 11
Syrian 0 443 11
officials, 0 443 11
including 0 443 11
the 0 443 11
defense 0 443 11
minister 0 443 11
and 0 443 11
the 0 443 11
chief 0 443 11
of 0 443 11
staff 0 443 11
of 0 443 11
the 0 443 11
Syrian 0 443 11
armed 0 443 11
forces. 0 443 11

Bagheri 0 443 12
is 0 443 12
quoted 0 443 12
as 0 443 12
saying 0 443 12
that 0 443 12
his 0 443 12
visit’s 0 443 12
purpose 0 443 12
was 0 443 12
to 0 443 12
“put 0 443 12
a 0 443 12
joint 0 443 12
strategy 0 443 12
on 0 443 12
continuing 0 443 12
co-ordination 0 443 12
and 0 443 12
co-operation 0 443 12
at 0 443 12
the 0 443 12
military 0 443 12
level.” 0 443 12
Some 0 443 12
experts 0 443 12
on 0 443 12
Iran 0 443 12
believe 0 443 12
that 0 443 12
Bagheri’s 0 443 12
visit 0 443 12
to 0 443 12
Damascus 0 443 12
at 0 443 12
this 0 443 12
time 0 443 12
is 0 443 12
intended 0 443 12
to 0 443 12
reinforce 0 443 12
a 0 443 12
message 0 443 12
that 0 443 12
Iran 0 443 12
will 0 443 12
continue 0 443 12
to 0 443 12
supply 0 443 12
weaponry 0 443 12
to 0 443 12
Syria 0 443 12
and 0 443 12
to 0 443 12
reinforce 0 443 12
the 0 443 12
presence 0 443 12
of 0 443 12
its 0 443 12
terrorist 0 443 12
proxy 0 443 12
Hezbollah 0 443 12
in 0 443 12
Syria. 0 443 12

This 1 443 13
will 1 443 13
not 1 443 13
only 1 443 13
serve 1 443 13
to 1 443 13
bolster 1 443 13
the 1 443 13
Assad 1 443 13
regime, 1 443 13
but 1 443 13
it 1 443 13
also 1 443 13
will 1 443 13
strengthen 1 443 13
Iran's 1 443 13
ability 1 443 13
to 1 443 13
follow 1 443 13
through 1 443 13
on 1 443 13
its 1 443 13
threats 1 443 13
to 1 443 13
the 1 443 13
U.S. 1 443 13
and 1 443 13
its 1 443 13
allies, 1 443 13
principally 1 443 13
Israel. 1 443 13

Meanwhile, 0 443 14
following 0 443 14
the 0 443 14
departure 0 443 14
of 0 443 14
the 0 443 14
Kurds 0 443 14
from 0 443 14
Kirkuk, 0 443 14
Iraq 0 443 14
earlier 0 443 14
this 0 443 14
week, 0 443 14
the 0 443 14
IRGC’s 0 443 14
operational 0 443 14
Al 0 443 14
Qods 0 443 14
arm 0 443 14
reportedly 0 443 14
established 0 443 14
a 0 443 14
command 0 443 14
center 0 443 14
and 0 443 14
five 0 443 14
bases 0 443 14
there. 0 443 14

According 0 443 15
to 0 443 15
Debkafile, 0 443 15
this 0 443 15
constitutes 0 443 15
“the 0 443 15
first 0 443 15
military 0 443 15
facility 0 443 15
Iran 0 443 15
has 0 443 15
ever 0 443 15
established 0 443 15
openly 0 443 15
in 0 443 15
Iraq.” 0 443 15
The 0 443 15
Kirkuk 0 443 15
region 0 443 15
holds 0 443 15
45 0 443 15
percent 0 443 15
of 0 443 15
Iraqi’s 0 443 15
oil. 0 443 15

The 1 443 16
Iraqi 1 443 16
branch 1 443 16
of 1 443 16
Iran’s 1 443 16
terrorist 1 443 16
proxy 1 443 16
Hezbollah 1 443 16
has 1 443 16
vowed 1 443 16
that 1 443 16
once 1 443 16
ISIS 1 443 16
is 1 443 16
defeated 1 443 16
it 1 443 16
will 1 443 16
start 1 443 16
killing 1 443 16
Americans, 1 443 16
as 1 443 16
it 1 443 16
has 1 443 16
done 1 443 16
before. 1 443 16

It 0 443 17
is 0 443 17
against 0 443 17
this 0 443 17
backdrop 0 443 17
that 0 443 17
U.S. 0 443 17
ambassador 0 443 17
to 0 443 17
the 0 443 17
United 0 443 17
Nations 0 443 17
Nikki 0 443 17
Haley 0 443 17
used 0 443 17
her 0 443 17
entire 0 443 17
speech 0 443 17
to 0 443 17
the 0 443 17
UN 0 443 17
Security 0 443 17
Council 0 443 17
on 0 443 17
Wednesday 0 443 17
to 0 443 17
denounce 0 443 17
the 0 443 17
Iranian 0 443 17
regime 0 443 17
on 0 443 17
multiple 0 443 17
grounds. 0 443 17

The 0 443 18
session 0 443 18
was 0 443 18
supposed 0 443 18
to 0 443 18
be 0 443 18
devoted 0 443 18
to 0 443 18
the 0 443 18
Israeli-Palestinian 0 443 18
conflict, 0 443 18
but 0 443 18
Ambassador 0 443 18
Haley 0 443 18
departed 0 443 18
from 0 443 18
the 0 443 18
monthly 0 443 18
ritual 0 443 18
during 0 443 18
which 0 443 18
Israel 0 443 18
is 0 443 18
normally 0 443 18
singled 0 443 18
out 0 443 18
for 0 443 18
criticism 0 443 18
by 0 443 18
other 0 443 18
Council 0 443 18
members. 0 443 18

She 0 443 19
went 0 443 19
after 0 443 19
Iran 0 443 19
instead. 0 443 19

She 0 443 20
explained 0 443 20
why 0 443 20
the 0 443 20
Trump 0 443 20
administration 0 443 20
decided 0 443 20
to 0 443 20
take 0 443 20
“a 0 443 20
comprehensive 0 443 20
approach 0 443 20
to 0 443 20
confronting 0 443 20
the 0 443 20
Iranian 0 443 20
regime,” 0 443 20
which 0 443 20
does 0 443 20
not 0 443 20
give 0 443 20
the 0 443 20
regime 0 443 20
a 0 443 20
get 0 443 20
out 0 443 20
of 0 443 20
