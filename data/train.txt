the 1 0 10

of 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
pneumonic 1 0 10
version, 1 0 10
which 1 0 10
spreads 1 0 10
more 1 0 10
easily 1 0 10
and 1 0 10
is 1 0 10
more 1 0 10
virulent, 1 0 10
in 1 0 10
the 1 0 10
latest 1 0 10
outbreak. 1 0 10

He 0 0 11
praised 0 0 11
the 0 0 11
rapid 0 0 11
response 0 0 11
from 0 0 11
WHO 0 0 11
and 0 0 11
Madagascar 0 0 11
authorities 0 0 11
that 0 0 11
helped 0 0 11
bring 0 0 11
the 0 0 11
outbreak 0 0 11
under 0 0 11

but 1 0 11
warned 1 0 11

over. 1 0 12
The 0 0 12
larger-than-usual 0 0 12

sanitation 0 0 13
and 0 0 13
vector 0 0 13
control 0 0 13

the 1 0 13
magnitude 1 0 13
in 1 0 13

he 0 0 15
warned. 0 0 15
Complicating 0 0 15

that 0 0 15

Garcia 0 2 2
Zarate, 0 2 2
a 0 2 2
45-year-old 0 2 2
Mexican 0 2 2
national 0 2 2
who 0 2 2
was 0 2 2
homeless 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
living 0 2 2
in 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
US 0 2 2
illegally 0 2 2
when 0 2 2
he 0 2 2
fired 0 2 2
the 0 2 2
shot 0 2 2
that 0 2 2
killed 0 2 2
Steinle, 0 2 2
was 0 2 2
acquitted 0 2 2
by 0 2 2
a 0 2 2
jury 0 2 2
on 0 2 2
murder 0 2 2
and 0 2 2
manslaughter 0 2 2
charges. 0 2 2

The 0 2 3
jury 0 2 3
convicted 0 2 3
him 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
the 0 2 3
lesser 0 2 3
charge 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
being 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
felon 0 2 3
in 0 2 3
possession 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
gun, 0 2 3
which 0 2 3
carries 0 2 3
a 0 2 3
maximum 0 2 3
sentence 0 2 3
of 0 2 3
three 0 2 3
years 0 2 3
in 0 2 3
state 0 2 3
prison. 0 2 3

Steinle, 0 2 4
32, 0 2 4
was 0 2 4
fatally 0 2 4
shot 0 2 4
while 0 2 4
she 0 2 4
walked 0 2 4
along 0 2 4
Pier 0 2 4
14 0 2 4
of 0 2 4
the 0 2 4
San 0 2 4
Francisco 0 2 4
Bay 0 2 4
with 0 2 4
her 0 2 4
father 0 2 4
in 0 2 4
July 0 2 4
2015. 0 2 4

The 0 2 5
bullet 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
pierced 0 2 5
her 0 2 5
back 0 2 5
had 0 2 5
ricocheted 0 2 5
off 0 2 5
the 0 2 5
concrete 0 2 5
ground 0 2 5
after 0 2 5
it 0 2 5
was 0 2 5
fired 0 2 5
by 0 2 5
Garcia 0 2 5
Zarate 0 2 5
from 0 2 5
a 0 2 5
handgun 0 2 5
belonging 0 2 5
to 0 2 5
a 0 2 5
federal 0 2 5
ranger 0 2 5
that 0 2 5
had 0 2 5
been 0 2 5
stolen 0 2 5
four 0 2 5
days 0 2 5
earlier. 0 2 5

Garcia 0 2 6
Zarate's 0 2 6
defense 0 2 6
attorneys 0 2 6
argued 0 2 6
that 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
shooting 0 2 6
was 0 2 6
an 0 2 6
accident 0 2 6
— 0 2 6
they 0 2 6
said 0 2 6
he 0 2 6
found 0 2 6
the 0 2 6
gun 0 2 6
wrapped 0 2 6
in 0 2 6
a 0 2 6
T-shirt 0 2 6
or 0 2 6
cloth 0 2 6
under 0 2 6
a 0 2 6
pier 0 2 6
bench 0 2 6
and 0 2 6
unintentionally 0 2 6
discharged 0 2 6

it. 0 2 7
Lead 0 2 7
attorney 0 2 7
Matt 0 2 7
Gonzalez 0 2 7
has 0 2 7
argued 0 2 7
that 0 2 7
the 0 2 7
weapon 0 2 7
was 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
SIG 0 2 7
Sauer 0 2 7
with 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
"hair 1 2 7
trigger 1 2 7
in 1 2 7
single-action 1 2 7
mode" 1 2 7
— 0 2 7
a 0 2 7
model 0 2 7
well-known 0 2 7
for 0 2 7
accidental 0 2 7
discharges 0 2 7
even 0 2 7
among 0 2 7
experienced 0 2 7
shooters. 0 2 7

Gonzalez 0 2 8
told 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
jury, 0 2 8
according 0 2 8
to 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
San 0 2 8
Francisco 0 2 8
Chronicle, 0 2 8
that 0 2 8
Garcia 0 2 8
Zarate 0 2 8
had 0 2 8
never 0 2 8
handled 0 2 8
a 0 2 8
firearm 0 2 8
before, 0 2 8
was 0 2 8
frightened 0 2 8
by 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
noise 0 2 8
of 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
gunshot, 0 2 8
then 0 2 8
flung 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
weapon 0 2 8
into 0 2 8
the 0 2 8
bay 0 2 8
where 0 2 8
it 0 2 8
was 0 2 8
later 0 2 8
found 0 2 8
by 0 2 8
a 0 2 8
diver. 0 2 8

Prosecutors, 0 2 9
however, 0 2 9
alleged 0 2 9
that 0 2 9
Garcia 0 2 9
Zarate 0 2 9
brought 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
weapon 0 2 9
to 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
pier 0 2 9
deliberately 0 2 9
to 0 2 9
do 0 2 9
harm, 0 2 9
and 0 2 9
intentionally 0 2 9
aimed 0 2 9
and 0 2 9
shot 0 2 9
Steinle 0 2 9
after 0 2 9
firmly 0 2 9
pulling 0 2 9
the 0 2 9
trigger. 0 2 9

They 0 2 10
said 0 2 10
Garcia 0 2 10
Zarate 0 2 10
then 0 2 10
threw 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
weapon 0 2 10
into 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
bay 0 2 10
and 0 2 10
fled 0 2 10
the 0 2 10
scene. 0 2 10

Beyond 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
shooting 0 2 11
itself, 0 2 11
perhaps 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
most 0 2 11
controversial 0 2 11
aspect 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
Garcia 0 2 11
Zarate's 0 2 11
case 0 2 11
involves 0 2 11
his 0 2 11
previous 0 2 11
criminal 0 2 11
activity 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
history 0 2 11
of 0 2 11
deportations, 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
how 0 2 11
San 0 2 11
Francisco 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
federal 0 2 11
authorities 0 2 11
handled 0 2 11
his 0 2 11
custody 0 2 11
before 0 2 11
he 0 2 11
ever 0 2 11
picked 0 2 11
up 0 2 11
the 0 2 11
gun 0 2 11
and 0 2 11
shot 0 2 11
Steinle. 0 2 11

At 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
time 0 2 12
of 0 2 12
Steinle's 0 2 12
death, 0 2 12
Garcia 0 2 12
Zarate 0 2 12
had 0 2 12
been 0 2 12
convicted 0 2 12
of 0 2 12
nonviolent 0 2 12
drug 0 2 12
crimes 0 2 12
and 0 2 12
deported 0 2 12
five 0 2 12
times 0 2 12
since 0 2 12
the 0 2 12
early 0 2 12
1990s. 0 2 12

He 0 2 13
faced 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
sixth 0 2 13
deportation 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
2015, 0 2 13
and 0 2 13
was 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
Justice 0 2 13
Department 0 2 13
(DOJ) 0 2 13
custody 0 2 13
that 0 2 13
March 0 2 13
after 0 2 13
serving 0 2 13
46 0 2 13
months 0 2 13
in 0 2 13
prison 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
felony 0 2 13
re-entry 0 2 13
into 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
US, 0 2 13
but 0 2 13
instead 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
transferring 0 2 13
him 0 2 13
into 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
custody 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
Immigration 0 2 13
and 0 2 13
Customs 0 2 13
Enforcement 0 2 13
(ICE) 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
deportation, 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
department 0 2 13
transferred 0 2 13
him 0 2 13
to 0 2 13
the 0 2 13
San 0 2 13
Francisco 0 2 13
County 0 2 13
Jail 0 2 13
for 0 2 13
prosecution 0 2 13
of 0 2 13
a 0 2 13
1995 0 2 13
marijuana 0 2 13
charge. 0 2 13

San 0 2 14
Francisco 0 2 14
prosecutors, 0 2 14
who 0 2 14
had 0 2 14
long 0 2 14
ago 0 2 14
deprioritized 0 2 14
marijuana 0 2 14
charges, 0 2 14
dismissed 0 2 14
the 0 2 14
decades-old 0 2 14
charge 0 2 14
and 0 2 14
released 0 2 14
Garcia 0 2 14
Zarate 0 2 14
on 0 2 14
April 0 2 14
15, 0 2 14

2015. 0 2 15
Due 0 2 15
to 0 2 15
San 0 2 15
Francisco's 0 2 15
policy 0 2 15
of 0 2 15
limiting 0 2 15
cooperation 0 2 15
with 0 2 15
federal 0 2 15
immigration 0 2 15
authorities 0 2 15
— 0 2 15
which 0 2 15
some 0 2 15
refer 0 2 15
to 0 2 15
as 0 2 15
a 0 2 15
"sanctuary" 1 2 15
policy 1 2 15
— 0 2 15
the 0 2 15
city 0 2 15
did 0 2 15
not 0 2 15
inform 0 2 15
ICE 0 2 15
when 0 2 15
they 0 2 15
released 0 2 15
Garcia 0 2 15

Zarate. 0 2 16
As 0 2 16
a 0 2 16
result 0 2 16
of 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
case, 0 2 16
both 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
DOJ 0 2 16
and 0 2 16
the 0 2 16
city 0 2 16
of 0 2 16
San 0 2 16
Francisco 0 2 16
have 0 2 16
changed 0 2 16
several 0 2 16
policies. 0 2 16

The 0 2 17
DOJ 0 2 17
announced 0 2 17
in 0 2 17
2016 0 2 17
it 0 2 17
would 0 2 17
no 0 2 17
longer 0 2 17
release 0 2 17
potentially 0 2 17
deportable 0 2 17
detainees 0 2 17
to 0 2 17
local 0 2 17
jails 0 2 17
without 0 2 17
first 0 2 17
allowing 0 2 17
ICE 0 2 17
to 0 2 17
take 0 2 17

custody. 0 2 18
San 0 2 18
Francisco, 0 2 18
meanwhile, 0 2 18
has 0 2 18
adjusted 0 2 18
its 0 2 18
policy 0 2 18
to 0 2 18
notify 0 2 18
ICE 0 2 18
if 0 2 18
they 0 2 18
are 0 2 18
releasing 0 2 18
suspected 0 2 18
undocumented 0 2 18
immigrants 0 2 18
who 0 2 18
face 0 2 18
charges 0 2 18
of 0 2 18
serious 0 2 18
or 0 2 18
violent 0 2 18
felonies. 0 2 18

"This 1 2 19
tragedy 1 2 19
could 1 2 19
have 1 2 19
been 1 2 19
prevented 1 2 19
if 1 2 19
San 1 2 19
Francisco 1 2 19
had 1 2 19
simply 1 2 19
turned 1 2 19
the 1 2 19
alien 1 2 19
over 1 2 19
to 1 2 19
ICE 1 2 19
as 1 2 19
we 1 2 19
requested, 1 2 19
instead 1 2 19
of 1 2 19
releasing 1 2 19
him 1 2 19
back 1 2 19
onto 1 2 19
the 1 2 19
streets," 1 2 19
ICE 0 2 19
Director 0 2 19
Thomas 0 2 19
Homan 0 2 19
said 0 2 19
in 0 2 19
a 0 2 19
statement 0 2 19
on 0 2 19

Thursday. 0 2 20
"It 0 2 20
is 0 2 20
unconscionable 0 2 20
that 0 2 20
politicians 1 2 20
across 1 2 20
this 1 2 20
country 1 2 20
continue 1 2 20
to 1 2 20
endanger 1 2 20
the 1 2 20
lives 1 2 20
of 1 2 20
Americans 1 2 20
with 1 2 20
sanctuary 1 2 20
policies 1 2 20
while 1 2 20
ignoring 1 2 20
the 1 2 20
harm 1 2 20
inflicted 1 2 20
on 1 2 20
their 1 2 20
constituents." 1 2 20

But 0 2 21
ICE 0 2 21
has 0 2 21
faced 0 2 21
criticism 0 2 21
of 0 2 21
its 0 2 21
own 0 2 21
over 0 2 21
not 0 2 21
seeking 0 2 21
a 0 2 21
judicial 0 2 21
warrant 0 2 21
to 0 2 21
legally 0 2 21
obtain 0 2 21
custody 0 2 21
of 0 2 21
Garcia 0 2 21
Zarate 0 2 21
when 0 2 21
it 0 2 21
discovered 0 2 21
he 0 2 21
had 0 2 21
been 0 2 21
transferred 0 2 21
into 0 2 21
San 0 2 21
Francisco's 0 2 21

custody. 0 2 22
The 0 2 22
agency 0 2 22
has 0 2 22
argued 0 2 22
that 0 2 22
obtaining 0 2 22
judicial 0 2 22
warrants 0 2 22
are 0 2 22
unnecessary 0 2 22
and 0 2 22
would 0 2 22
place 0 2 22
too 0 2 22
much 0 2 22
burden 0 2 22
on 0 2 22
ICE 0 2 22
officials 0 2 22
and 0 2 22
federal 0 2 22

courts. 0 2 23
Though 0 2 23
the 0 2 23
agency 0 2 23
did 0 2 23
issue 0 2 23
a 0 2 23
request 0 2 23
to 0 2 23
the 0 2 23
city 0 2 23
to 0 2 23
detain 0 2 23
Garcia 0 2 23
Zarate 0 2 23
until 0 2 23
ICE 0 2 23
officials 0 2 23
could 0 2 23
pick 0 2 23
him 0 2 23
up, 0 2 23
their 0 2 23
detainer 0 2 23
requests 0 2 23
are 0 2 23
not 0 2 23
signed 0 2 23
by 0 2 23
a 0 2 23
judge 0 2 23
and 0 2 23
are 0 2 23
therefore 0 2 23
not 0 2 23
legally 0 2 23

binding. 0 2 24
San 0 2 24
Francisco's 0 2 24
policy 0 2 24
is 0 2 24
to 0 2 24
ignore 0 2 24
such 0 2 24
requests 0 2 24
if 0 2 24
they 0 2 24
are 0 2 24
not 0 2 24
accompanied 0 2 24
by 0 2 24
judge-signed 0 2 24
warrants, 0 2 24
and 0 2 24
the 0 2 24
city 0 2 24
has 0 2 24
cited 0 2 24
federal 0 2 24
court 0 2 24
cases 0 2 24
concluding 0 2 24
that 0 2 24

She 0 6 10
told 0 6 10
a 0 6 10
town 0 6 10
hall 0 6 10
that 0 6 10
“local, 0 6 10
state 0 6 10

that 0 6 11

but 0 6 11
did 0 6 11
not 0 6 11
plan 0 6 11
to 0 6 11
review 0 6 11
her 0 6 11
employment 0 6 11
until 0 6 11
a 0 6 11
criminal 0 6 11
investigation 0 6 11
wrapped 0 6 11
up 0 6 11
— 0 6 11

months 0 6 11

away. 0 6 12
In 0 6 12
a 0 6 12
statement, 0 6 12
Hall 0 6 12
said 0 6 12
that 0 6 12
any 0 6 12
disciplinary 0 6 12
investigation 0 6 12
would 0 6 12
risk 0 6 12
compromising 0 6 12

“That 0 6 13

Police 0 6 14
did 0 6 14
not 0 6 14
explain 0 6 14
what 0 6 14
changed 0 6 14
by 0 6 14
Monday, 0 6 14
when 0 6 14
the 0 6 14
department 0 6 14
announced 0 6 14
that 0 6 14
an 0 6 14
internal-affairs 0 6 14

had 0 6 14
been 0 6 14
launched 0 6 14

already 0 6 14
“concluded” 0 6 14
that 0 6 14
Guyger’s 0 6 14
arrest 0 6 14
was 0 6 14
a 0 6 14
fireable 0 6 14
offense. 0 6 14

The 0 6 15
officer, 0 6 15

was 0 6 15
hired 0 6 15
in 0 6 15

hearing 0 6 15
Monday 0 6 15
morning 0 6 15
“for 0 6 15
her 0 6 15
actions.” 0 6 15

The 0 6 16
statement 0 6 16
notes 0 6 16
that 0 6 16
Guyger 0 6 16
can 0 6 16
appeal 0 6 16
her 0 6 16

firing. 0 6 17
Police 0 6 17
did 0 6 17
not 0 6 17
comment 0 6 17
on 0 6 17
whether 0 6 17
Hall 0 6 17
is 0 6 17
still 0 6 17
worried 0 6 17
that 0 6 17
the 0 6 17
termination 0 6 17
might 0 6 17
affect 0 6 17
the 0 6 17

ends 0 10 0
with 0 10 0
'special 0 10 0
bond' 0 10 0
with 0 10 0

Nearly 0 10 1
five 0 10 1
hours 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
unprecedented 1 10 1
and 0 10 1
surreal 1 10 1
talks 0 10 1
between 0 10 1

culminated 1 10 1
on 0 10 1
Tuesday 0 10 1
with 0 10 1
fulsome 1 10 1
declarations 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
a 0 10 1
new 0 10 1
friendship 0 10 1
but 0 10 1
just 0 10 1
vague 0 10 1
pledges 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
nuclear 0 10 1
disarmament. 0 10 1

For 0 10 2
Trump, 0 10 2
that 0 10 2
amounted 0 10 2
to 0 10 2
a 0 10 2
triumphant 1 10 2
outcome 0 10 2
in 0 10 2
his 0 10 2
extraordinary 1 10 2
gamble 0 10 2
with 0 10 2
the 0 10 2
rogue 1 10 2
kingdom's 1 10 2
despotic 1 10 2
leader. 1 10 2

But 0 10 3
there 0 10 3
were 0 10 3
scant 0 10 3
details 0 10 3
on 0 10 3
what 0 10 3
new 0 10 3
commitments 0 10 3
had 0 10 3
been 0 10 3
secured 0 10 3
from 0 10 3
Kim, 0 10 3
even 0 10 3
as 0 10 3
Trump 0 10 3
announced 0 10 3
he 0 10 3
would 0 10 3
end 0 10 3
the 0 10 3
regular 0 10 3
military 0 10 3

the 0 10 3
US 0 10 3

with 0 10 3
South 0 10 3
Korea. 0 10 3

Whether 0 10 4
nuclear 0 10 4
disarmament 0 10 4
is 0 10 4
indeed 0 10 4
the 0 10 4
final 0 10 4
outcome 0 10 4
of 0 10 4
Tuesday's 0 10 4
summit 0 10 4
won't 0 10 4
be 0 10 4
known 0 10 4
for 0 10 4
years, 0 10 4
if 0 10 4
not 0 10 4
decades. 0 10 4

But 0 10 5
the 0 10 5
dramatic 1 10 5
act 0 10 5
of 0 10 5
extending 0 10 5
his 0 10 5
hand 0 10 5
to 0 10 5
one 0 10 5
of 0 10 5
America's 0 10 5
longtime 0 10 5
adversaries 0 10 5
will 0 10 5
forever 1 10 5
illustrate 0 10 5
Trump's 1 10 5
gut-driven, 1 10 5
norm-shattering 1 10 5
tenure. 1 10 5

"We 0 10 6
both 0 10 6
want 0 10 6
to 0 10 6
do 0 10 6
something. 0 10 6

We 0 10 7
both 0 10 7
are 0 10 7
going 0 10 7
to 0 10 7
do 0 10 7
something. 0 10 7

And 0 10 8
we 0 10 8
have 0 10 8
developed 0 10 8
a 0 10 8
very 0 10 8
special 0 10 8
bond," 0 10 8
Trump 0 10 8
said 0 10 8
at 0 10 8
the 0 10 8
conclusion 0 10 8
of 0 10 8
the 0 10 8
landmark 0 10 8
summit. 0 10 8

"People 1 10 9
are 1 10 9
going 1 10 9
to 1 10 9
be 1 10 9
very 1 10 9
impressed. 1 10 9

People 0 10 10
are 0 10 10
going 0 10 10
to 0 10 10
be 0 10 10
very 0 10 10
happy." 0 10 10

The 0 10 11
document 0 10 11
he 0 10 11
and 0 10 11
Kim 0 10 11
signed 0 10 11
said 0 10 11
the 0 10 11
North 0 10 11
Korean 0 10 11
leader 0 10 11
"reaffirmed 0 10 11
his 0 10 11
firm 0 10 11
and 0 10 11
unwavering 1 10 11
commitment 0 10 11
to 0 10 11
complete 0 10 11
denuclearization 0 10 11
of 0 10 11
the 0 10 11
Korean 0 10 11
Peninsula." 0 10 11

In 0 10 12
exchange, 0 10 12
Trump 0 10 12
agreed 0 10 12
to 0 10 12
"provide 0 10 12
security 0 10 12
guarantees" 0 10 12
to 0 10 12
North 0 10 12
Korea. 0 10 12

But 0 10 13
there 0 10 13
was 0 10 13
no 0 10 13
mentioning 0 10 13
the 0 10 13
previous 0 10 13
US 0 10 13
aim 0 10 13
of 0 10 13
"complete, 0 10 13
verifiable 0 10 13
and 0 10 13
irreversible 0 10 13
denuclearization." 0 10 13

And 0 10 14
Kim's 0 10 14
commitments 0 10 14
did 0 10 14
not 0 10 14
appear 0 10 14
to 0 10 14
go 0 10 14
beyond 0 10 14
what 0 10 14
he 0 10 14
already 0 10 14
pledged 0 10 14
to 0 10 14
do 0 10 14
in 0 10 14
April 0 10 14
when 0 10 14
he 0 10 14
met 0 10 14
South 0 10 14
Korean 0 10 14
President 0 10 14
Moon 0 10 14
Jae-in 0 10 14
along 0 10 14
their 0 10 14
countries' 0 10 14
border. 0 10 14

Trump 0 10 15
insisted 0 10 15
during 0 10 15
a 0 10 15
news 0 10 15
conference 0 10 15
the 0 10 15
agreement 0 10 15
went 0 10 15
further 0 10 15
than 0 10 15
many 0 10 15
people 0 10 15
expected. 0 10 15

But 0 10 16
he 0 10 16
acknowledged 0 10 16
the 0 10 16
effort 0 10 16
to 0 10 16
rid 0 10 16
North 0 10 16
Korea 0 10 16
of 0 10 16
its 0 10 16
nuclear 0 10 16
arsenal 0 10 16
was 0 10 16
in 0 10 16
its 0 10 16
early 0 10 16
stages. 0 10 16

"We 0 10 17
will 0 10 17
do 0 10 17
it 0 10 17
as 0 10 17
fast 0 10 17
as 0 10 17
it 0 10 17
can 0 10 17
mechanically 0 10 17
and 0 10 17
physically 0 10 17
be 0 10 17
done," 0 10 17
he 0 10 17
said. 0 10 17

More 0 10 18
critical, 0 10 18
in 0 10 18
Trump's 0 10 18
telling, 0 10 18
was 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
development 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
a 0 10 18
personal 0 10 18
bond 0 10 18
with 0 10 18
Kim, 0 10 18
a 0 10 18
brutal 1 10 18
dictator 1 10 18
responsible 0 10 18
for 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
deaths 0 10 18
not 0 10 18
only 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
his 0 10 18
own 0 10 18
citizens 0 10 18
but 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
at 0 10 18
least 0 10 18
one 0 10 18
American, 0 10 18
Otto 0 10 18
Warmbier, 0 10 18
who 0 10 18
was 0 10 18
returned 0 10 18
to 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
US 0 10 18

a 0 10 18
coma 0 10 18
only 0 10 18
to 0 10 18
die 0 10 18
days 0 10 18
later. 0 10 18

"I 0 10 19

whole 0 10 19
relationship 0 10 19
with 0 10 19

a 0 10 19
very 0 10 19
much 0 10 19
different 0 10 19
situation 0 10 19
than 0 10 19
it 0 10 19
has 0 10 19
in 0 10 19
the 0 10 19
past," 0 10 19
Trump 0 10 19
said 0 10 19
during 0 10 19
the 0 10 19
summit. 0 10 19

Later, 0 10 20
during 0 10 20
his 0 10 20
news 0 10 20
conference, 0 10 20
Trump 0 10 20

contributed 0 10 20
to 0 10 20
the 0 10 20
summit 0 10 20
taking 0 10 20
place. 0 10 20

"Without 0 10 21
Otto, 0 10 21
this 0 10 21
would 0 10 21
not 0 10 21
have 0 10 21
happened," 0 10 21
Trump 0 10 21
said. 0 10 21

Trump 0 10 22
and 0 10 22
Kim 0 10 22
-- 0 10 22
both 0 10 22
intent 0 10 22
on 0 10 22
making 0 10 22
history 0 10 22

greeted 0 10 22
each 0 10 22
other 0 10 22
early 0 10 22
in 0 10 22
the 0 10 22

with 0 10 22
extended 0 10 22
hands 0 10 22
in 0 10 22

of 0 10 22
a 0 10 22

of 0 10 22
US 0 10 22
and 0 10 22
North 0 10 22
Korean 0 10 22
flags, 0 10 22
a 0 10 22
previously 0 10 22
unthinkable 1 10 22
sight 0 10 22
that 0 10 22
reflects 0 10 22
a 0 10 22
new 0 10 22
chapter 0 10 22
in 0 10 22
the 0 10 22
two 0 10 22
countries' 0 10 22
acrimonious 1 10 22
relationship. 0 10 22

Trump's 0 10 23
threats 0 10 23
to 0 10 23
politely 0 10 23
walk 0 10 23
out 0 10 23
of 0 10 23
the 0 10 23
meeting 0 10 23
if 0 10 23
his 0 10 23
expectations 0 10 23
were 0 10 23
unmet 0 10 23
did 0 10 23
not 0 10 23
materialize. 0 10 23

Instead 0 10 24
he 0 10 24
predicted 0 10 24
he 0 10 24
could 0 10 24
"solve 0 10 24
a 0 10 24
big 1 10 24
problem, 1 10 24
a 0 10 24

dilemma" 1 10 24
alongside 0 10 24
his 0 10 24
new 0 10 24
partner. 0 10 24

"Working 1 10 25

it 1 10 25
taken 1 10 25
care 1 10 25
of," 1 10 25
Trump 0 10 25
said. 0 10 25

The 0 10 26
remarks 0 10 26
came 0 10 26
amid 0 10 26
an 0 10 26
improbable 0 10 26
series 0 10 26
of 0 10 26
events 0 10 26
that 0 10 26
few 0 10 26
could 0 10 26
have 0 10 26
anticipated 0 10 26
even 0 10 26
three 0 10 26

counterparts 0 10 27
engaging 0 10 27
in 0 10 27
friendly 0 10 27
dialogue 0 10 27
lent 0 10 27
the 0 10 27
day 0 10 27
an 0 10 27
air 0 10 27
of 0 10 27
unreality. 0 10 27

In 0 10 28
a 0 10 28
detailed 0 10 28
menu, 0 10 28
the 0 10 28
White 0 10 28

Other 0 10 29
unforeseen 0 10 29
events 0 10 29
also 0 10 29
surrounded 0 10 29
the 0 10 29
summit, 0 10 29
increasing 1 10 29
the 1 10 29
drama. 1 10 29

Minutes 0 10 30
before 0 10 30
the 0 10 30
historic 1 10 30
handshake, 0 10 30
Trump 0 10 30
tweeted 0 10 30
that 0 10 30

top 0 10 30
economic 0 10 30

suffered 0 10 30
a 0 10 30
heart 0 10 30
attack. 0 10 30

Immediately 0 10 31
after 0 10 31
the 0 10 31
encounter, 0 10 31
Dennis 0 10 31

CNN's 0 10 31

Even 0 10 32

seemed 0 10 32
to 0 10 32

the 0 10 32

of 0 10 32
the 0 10 32

"Many 0 10 33

the 0 10 33

At 0 10 34
the 0 10 34
conclusion 0 10 34
of 0 10 34
the 0 10 34
summit, 0 10 34
Trump 0 10 34
hailed 1 10 34
the 0 10 34
talks 0 10 34
as 0 10 34
a 0 10 34
historic, 1 10 34
and 0 10 34
personal, 0 10 34
achievement. 0 10 34

"We 0 10 35
learned 0 10 35
a 0 10 35
lot 0 10 35
about 0 10 35
each 0 10 35
other 0 10 35
and 0 10 35
our 0 10 35
countries," 0 10 35
Trump 0 10 35
said. 0 10 35

"I 0 10 36
learned 0 10 36
he's 0 10 36
a 0 10 36
very 1 10 36
talented 1 10 36
man." 1 10 36

When 0 10 37
pressed 0 10 37
about 0 10 37
those 0 10 37
comments 0 10 37
in 0 10 37
light 0 10 37
of 0 10 37
Kim's 0 10 37
brutal 1 10 37
tactics, 0 10 37
Trump 0 10 37
continued 0 10 37
praising 1 10 37
the 0 10 37
North 0 10 37
Korean 0 10 37
leaders' 0 10 37
ability 0 10 37
to 0 10 37
run 0 10 37
a 0 10 37
country 0 10 37
at 0 10 37
a 0 10 37
young 0 10 37
age. 0 10 37

"He 0 10 38
is 0 10 38
very 1 10 38
talented," 1 10 38
Trump 0 10 38
said, 0 10 38
citing 0 10 38
Kim's 0 10 38
ability 0 10 38
to 0 10 38
"take 0 10 38
over 0 10 38
a 0 10 38
situation 0 10 38
like 0 10 38
he 0 10 38
did 0 10 38
at 0 10 38
26 0 10 38
years 0 10 38
of 0 10 38
age 0 10 38
and 0 10 38
run 0 10 38
it, 0 10 38
and 0 10 38
run 0 10 38
it 0 10 38
tough." 0 10 38

Kim 0 10 39
assumed 0 10 39
power 0 10 39
after 0 10 39
his 0 10 39
father 0 10 39
Kim 0 10 39
Jong 0 10 39
Il, 0 10 39
also 0 10 39
a 0 10 39
brutal 1 10 39
dictator, 1 10 39
died 0 10 39
in 0 10 39
2011. 0 10 39

Throughout 0 10 40
the 0 10 40
day, 0 10 40
Trump 0 10 40
and 0 10 40
Kim's 0 10 40
body 0 10 40
language 0 10 40
was 0 10 40
openly 0 10 40
friendly, 0 10 40
a 0 10 40
striking 1 10 40
warmth 0 10 40
given 0 10 40
Kim's 0 10 40
iron 0 10 40
grip 0 10 40
on 0 10 40
power 0 10 40
and 0 10 40
dismal 0 10 40
record 0 10 40
on 0 10 40
human 0 10 40
rights. 0 10 40

Trump's 0 10 41
move 0 10 41
to 0 10 41
meet 0 10 41
him 0 10 41
attracted 0 10 41
fierce 1 10 41
criticism 1 10 41
for 0 10 41
normalizing 0 10 41
a 0 10 41
regime 0 10 41
routinely 0 10 41
called 0 10 41
out 0 10 41
for 0 10 41
its 0 10 41
human 0 10 41
rights 0 10 41
abuses, 0 10 41
that 0 10 41
over 0 10 41
years 0 10 41
has 0 10 41
built 0 10 41
an 0 10 41
image 0 10 41
of 0 10 41
fearsome 1 10 41
renegade 1 10 41
regime, 0 10 41
throwing 0 10 41
around 0 10 41
threats 0 10 41
of 0 10 41
nuclear 0 10 41
war. 0 10 41

The 0 10 42
day 0 10 42
began 0 10 42
with 0 10 42
Trump 0 10 42
patting 0 10 42
Kim 0 10 42
on 0 10 42
the 0 10 42
back 0 10 42
and 0 10 42
placing 0 10 42
his 0 10 42
hand 0 10 42
on 0 10 42
the 0 10 42
North 0 10 42
Korean's 0 10 42
shoulder 0 10 42
as 0 10 42
they 0 10 42
walked 0 10 42
into 0 10 42
their 0 10 42
first 0 10 42
meeting. 0 10 42

Later 0 10 43
they 0 10 43
were 0 10 43
seen 0 10 43
smiling 0 10 43
and 0 10 43
laughing 0 10 43
over 0 10 43
lunch. 0 10 43

Trump 0 10 44
told 0 10 44
reporters 0 10 44
he 0 10 44
would 0 10 44
"absolutely" 1 10 44
extend 0 10 44
an 0 10 44
invitation 0 10 44
to 0 10 44
the 0 10 44
White 0 10 44
House 0 10 44
to 0 10 44
Kim, 0 10 44
who 0 10 44
also 0 10 44
heralded 1 10 44
a 1 10 44
new 1 10 44
era. 1 10 44

"Today, 0 10 45
we 0 10 45
had 0 10 45
a 0 10 45
historic 1 10 45
meeting 0 10 45
and 0 10 45
decided 0 10 45
to 0 10 45
leave 0 10 45
the 0 10 45
past 0 10 45
behind," 0 10 45
Kim 0 10 45
said 0 10 45
through 0 10 45
a 0 10 45
translator. 0 10 45

"The 1 10 46
world 1 10 46
will 0 10 46
see 0 10 46
a 0 10 46
major 0 10 46
change." 0 10 46

The 0 10 47
meeting 0 10 47
came 0 10 47
only 0 10 47
months 0 10 47
after 0 10 47
the 0 10 47
two 0 10 47
men 0 10 47
traded 0 10 47
nuclear 0 10 47
taunts, 0 10 47
ratcheting 0 10 47
up 0 10 47
tensions 0 10 47
and 0 10 47
leading 0 10 47
to 0 10 47
fears 0 10 47
of 0 10 47
war. 0 10 47

By 0 10 48
contrast, 0 10 48
Trump 0 10 48
appeared 0 10 48
to 0 10 48
back 0 10 48
off 0 10 48
a 0 10 48
military 0 10 48
footing 0 10 48
on 0 10 48
Tuesday, 0 10 48
declaring 0 10 48
the 0 10 48
US 0 10 48
will 0 10 48
stop 0 10 48
the 0 10 48
"war 0 10 48
games," 0 10 48
an 0 10 48
apparent 0 10 48
reference 0 10 48
to 0 10 48
joint 0 10 48
military 0 10 48
exercises 0 10 48
with 0 10 48
South 0 10 48
Korea 0 10 48
that 0 10 48
North 0 10 48
Korea 0 10 48
has 0 10 48
long 0 10 48
rebuked 0 10 48
as 0 10 48
provocative. 0 10 48

Trump 0 10 49
also 0 10 49
said 0 10 49
he 0 10 49
hopes 0 10 49
to 0 10 49
eventually 0 10 49
withdraw 0 10 49
US 0 10 49
forces 0 10 49
from 0 10 49
South 0 10 49
Korea, 0 10 49
but 0 10 49
said 0 10 49
"that's 0 10 49
not 0 10 49
part 0 10 49
of 0 10 49
the 0 10 49
equation 0 10 49
right 0 10 49
now." 0 10 49

"I 0 10 50
want 0 10 50
to 0 10 50
get 0 10 50
our 1 10 50
soldiers 1 10 50
out. 0 10 50

I 0 10 51
want 0 10 51
to 0 10 51
bring 0 10 51
our 1 10 51
soldiers 1 10 51
back 0 10 51
home," 0 10 51
Trump 0 10 51
said. 0 10 51

"But 0 10 52
that's 0 10 52
not 0 10 52
part 0 10 52
of 0 10 52
the 0 10 52
equation 0 10 52
right 0 10 52
now. 0 10 52

I 0 10 53
hope 0 10 53
it 0 10 53
will 0 10 53
be 0 10 53
eventually." 0 10 53

Tuesday's 0 10 54
meeting, 0 10 54
convened 0 10 54
at 0 10 54
a 0 10 54
luxury 0 10 54
hotel 0 10 54
on 0 10 54
the 0 10 54
island 0 10 54
of 0 10 54
Sentosa, 0 10 54
came 0 10 54
just 0 10 54
three 0 10 54
months 0 10 54
after 0 10 54
Trump 0 10 54
accepted 0 10 54
North 0 10 54
Korea's 0 10 54
invitation 0 10 54
for 0 10 54
talks 0 10 54
on 0 10 54
the 0 10 54
spot. 0 10 54

It 0 10 55
was 0 10 55
an 0 10 55
extraordinarily 0 10 55
compressed 0 10 55
timeline 0 10 55
for 0 10 55
the 0 10 55
landmark 0 10 55
summit, 0 10 55
which 0 10 55
at 0 10 55
one 0 10 55
point 0 10 55
was 0 10 55
called 0 10 55
off 0 10 55
entirely 0 10 55
as 0 10 55
communication 0 10 55
broke 0 10 55
down 0 10 55
between 0 10 55
Washington 0 10 55
and 0 10 55
Pyongyang. 0 10 55

The 0 10 56
talks 0 10 56
were 0 10 56
quickly 0 10 56
revived, 0 10 56
leading 0 10 56
to 0 10 56
the 0 10 56
highly 0 10 56
choreographed 0 10 56
event 0 10 56
that 0 10 56
unfolded 0 10 56
Tuesday. 0 10 56

After 0 10 57
the 0 10 57
men 0 10 57
shook 0 10 57
hands, 0 10 57
they 0 10 57
repaired 0 10 57
inside 0 10 57
for 0 10 57
one-on-one 0 10 57
talks. 0 10 57

In 0 10 58
that 0 10 58
first 0 10 58
meeting 0 10 58
they 0 10 58
were 0 10 58
joined 0 10 58
only 0 10 58
by 0 10 58
translators, 0 10 58
a 0 10 58
break 0 10 58
from 0 10 58
standard 0 10 58
practice 0 10 58
of 0 10 58
having 0 10 58
at 0 10 58
least 0 10 58
one 0 10 58
aide 0 10 58
present 0 10 58
for 0 10 58
high-stakes 0 10 58
huddles. 0 10 58

Later 0 10 59
in 0 10 59
the 0 10 59
day, 0 10 59
advisers 0 10 59
joined 0 10 59
the 0 10 59
talks 0 10 59
for 0 10 59
a 0 10 59
larger 0 10 59
bilateral 0 10 59
session 0 10 59
and 0 10 59
a 0 10 59
working 0 10 59
lunch. 0 10 59

Trump 0 10 60
took 0 10 60
keen 0 10 60
interest 0 10 60
in 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
pageantry 0 10 60
of 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
day, 0 10 60
insisting 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
pictures 0 10 60
beamed 0 10 60
around 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
world 0 10 60
reflect 0 10 60
a 0 10 60
commanding 1 10 60
leader 1 10 60
making 0 10 60
a 0 10 60
decisive, 0 10 60
world-altering 1 10 60
move. 0 10 60

At 0 10 61
the 0 10 61
same 0 10 61
time, 0 10 61
he'd 0 10 61
admitted 0 10 61
he 0 10 61
didn't 0 10 61
believe 0 10 61
he 0 10 61
required 0 10 61
extensive 0 10 61
preparation 0 10 61
to 0 10 61
take 0 10 61
stock 0 10 61
of 0 10 61
Kim. 0 10 61

As 0 10 62
part 0 10 62
of 0 10 62
the 0 10 62
advance 0 10 62
work, 0 10 62
Trump 0 10 62
commissioned 0 10 62
a 0 10 62
highly 0 10 62
produced 0 10 62
video 0 10 62
meant 0 10 62
to 0 10 62
convince 0 10 62
Kim 0 10 62
to 0 10 62
relinquish 0 10 62
his 0 10 62
weapons 0 10 62
and 0 10 62
open 0 10 62
his 0 10 62
country 0 10 62
to 0 10 62
outside 0 10 62
investment. 0 10 62

Trump 0 10 63
showed 0 10 63
Kim 0 10 63
the 0 10 63
movie 0 10 63
on 0 10 63
an 0 10 63
iPad 0 10 63
during 0 10 63
their 0 10 63
talks. 0 10 63

Here 0 10 64
in 0 10 64
futuristic 1 10 64
Singapore, 0 10 64
however, 0 10 64
Kim 0 10 64
was 0 10 64
able 0 10 64
to 0 10 64
view 0 10 64
the 0 10 64
benefits 0 10 64
of 0 10 64
economic 0 10 64
advancement 0 10 64
at 0 10 64
close 0 10 64
range. 0 10 64

He 0 10 65
was 0 10 65
spotted 0 10 65
taking 0 10 65
a 0 10 65
moonlit 0 10 65

imagine 0 10 65
coming 0 10 65
to 0 10 65
their 0 10 65

was 0 11 7
a 0 11 7
little 0 11 7
bit 0 11 7
of 0 11 7
a 0 11 7
surprise,” 0 11 7
Trenton 0 11 7
said 0 11 7
as 0 11 7
he 0 11 7
sat 0 11 7
with 0 11 7
his 0 11 7
parents, 0 11 7
Brett 0 11 7

Courtney 0 11 7
Tolliver, 0 11 7
one 0 11 7
day 0 11 7
this 0 11 7
month 0 11 7
watching 0 11 7
his 0 11 7
little 0 11 7

soccer 0 11 7
practice 0 11 7
on 0 11 7

This 0 11 8
spring, 0 11 8
Bible 0 11 8
classes 0 11 8
such 0 11 8
as 0 11 8
Trenton’s 0 11 8
are 0 11 8
on 0 11 8
the 0 11 8
minds 0 11 8
of 0 11 8
many 0 11 8
here 0 11 8
in 0 11 8
Mercer 0 11 8
County. 0 11 8

For 0 11 9
decades, 0 11 9
the 0 11 9
county’s 0 11 9
public 0 11 9
schools 0 11 9
have 0 11 9
offered 0 11 9
a 0 11 9
weekly 0 11 9
Bible 0 11 9
class 0 11 9
during 0 11 9
the 0 11 9
school 0 11 9
day 0 11 9
— 0 11 9
30 0 11 9
minutes 0 11 9
at 0 11 9
the 0 11 9
elementary 0 11 9
level 0 11 9
and 0 11 9
45 0 11 9

school. 0 11 9

Bible 0 11 10
classes 0 11 10
on 0 11 10
school 0 11 10
time 0 11 10
are 0 11 10
a 0 11 10
rarity 0 11 10
in 0 11 10
public 0 11 10
education, 0 11 10
but 0 11 10
here 0 11 10
they 0 11 10
are 0 11 10
a 0 11 10
long-standing 0 11 10
tradition. 0 11 10

The 0 11 11
program 0 11 11
is 0 11 11
not 0 11 11
mandatory, 0 11 11
but 0 11 11
almost 0 11 11
every 0 11 11
child 0 11 11
in 0 11 11
the 0 11 11
district 0 11 11
attends. 0 11 11

And 0 11 12
there 0 11 12
is 0 11 12
widespread 0 11 12
support 0 11 12
for 0 11 12
the 0 11 12
classes: 0 11 12
Parents 0 11 12
and 0 11 12
community 0 11 12
members 0 11 12
help 0 11 12
raise 0 11 12
nearly 0 11 12
$500,000 0 11 12
a 0 11 12
year 0 11 12

the 0 11 12
Bible 0 11 12

the 0 11 12
Schools 0 11 12
program. 0 11 12

Now 0 11 13
Bible 0 11 13
in 0 11 13
the 0 11 13
Schools 0 11 13
is 0 11 13
facing 0 11 13
a 0 11 13

in 0 11 14
a 0 11 14
lawsuit 0 11 14
that 0 11 14

and 0 11 15
students.” 0 11 15

Supporters 0 11 16
are 0 11 16
adamant 0 11 16
that 0 11 16
the 0 11 16
weekly 0 11 16
class 0 11 16
is 0 11 16
an 0 11 16
elective 0 11 16
meant 0 11 16
to 0 11 16
explore 0 11 16
the 0 11 16
history 0 11 16
and 0 11 16
literature 0 11 16
of 0 11 16
the 0 11 16
Bible, 0 11 16
not 0 11 16
to 0 11 16
promote 0 11 16
religious 0 11 16
belief. 0 11 16

“My 0 11 17
experience 0 11 17
with 0 11 17
it 0 11 17
has 0 11 17
been 0 11 17
very 0 11 17
positive. 0 11 17

I’ve 0 11 18
never 0 11 18
known 0 11 18
of 0 11 18
anyone 0 11 18
who 0 11 18
has 0 11 18
been 0 11 18
pressured 0 11 18
or 0 11 18
felt 0 11 18

the 0 11 18
Rev. 0 11 18

David 0 11 19
W. 0 11 19
Dockery, 0 11 19

“Any 0 11 20
time 0 11 20
God’s 0 11 20
word 0 11 20
can 0 11 20
be 0 11 20
proclaimed 0 11 20
is 0 11 20
beneficial 1 11 20
and 0 11 20
is 0 11 20
a 1 11 20
good 1 11 20
thing.” 1 11 20

Trenton’s 0 11 21
parents 0 11 21
also 0 11 21
find 0 11 21
it 0 11 21
hard 0 11 21
to 0 11 21
see 0 11 21
why 0 11 21
there 0 11 21
would 0 11 21
be 0 11 21
objections. 0 11 21

“I 0 11 22
think 0 11 22
it’s 0 11 22
a 0 11 22
great 0 11 22
program 0 11 22
mainly 0 11 22
because 0 11 22
it’s 0 11 22
the 0 11 22
only 0 11 22
chance 0 11 22
for 0 11 22
some 0 11 22
of 0 11 22
these 0 11 22
kids 0 11 22
to 0 11 22
even 0 11 22
see 0 11 22
the 0 11 22
Bible,” 0 11 22
said 0 11 22
Brett 0 11 22
Tolliver, 0 11 22

27. 0 11 23
“More 0 11 23
importantly, 0 11 23
I 0 11 23
don’t 0 11 23
know 0 11 23
who 0 11 23
it 0 11 23
harms. 0 11 23

The 0 11 24
kids 0 11 24
aren’t 0 11 24
forced 0 11 24
to 0 11 24
be 0 11 24
there.” 0 11 24

Courtney 0 11 25
Tolliver, 0 11 25
26, 0 11 25
a 0 11 25
teacher 0 11 25
in 0 11 25
the 0 11 25
district, 0 11 25
agrees. 0 11 25

“It’s 0 11 26
not 0 11 26
teaching 0 11 26
religion, 0 11 26
but 0 11 26
it 0 11 26
teaches 0 11 26
character 0 11 26
and 0 11 26
respect 0 11 26
and 0 11 26
how 0 11 26
important 0 11 26
it 0 11 26
is 0 11 26
to 0 11 26
tell 0 11 26
the 0 11 26
truth,” 0 11 26
she 0 11 26

said. 0 11 27
“The 0 11 27
kids 0 11 27
love 0 11 27
it 0 11 27
and 0 11 27
the 0 11 27
ones 0 11 27
who 0 11 27
don’t 0 11 27
participate 0 11 27
aren’t 0 11 27
made 0 11 27
to 0 11 27
feel 0 11 27
left 0 11 27

out.” 0 11 28
But 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
plaintiffs 0 11 28
in 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
suit 0 11 28
and 0 11 28
their 0 11 28
backers 0 11 28
argue 0 11 28
that 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
program’s 0 11 28
popularity 0 11 28
shouldn’t 0 11 28
matter 0 11 28
in 0 11 28
the 0 11 28
face 0 11 28
of 0 11 28
Supreme 0 11 28
Court 0 11 28
rulings 0 11 28
such 0 11 28
as 0 11 28
McCollum 0 11 28
v. 0 11 28
Board 0 11 28
of 0 11 28
Education 0 11 28
in 0 11 28
1948 0 11 28
that 0 11 28

religious 0 11 28
activity. 0 11 28

The 0 11 29
suit 0 11 29
alleges 0 11 29
that 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
lessons 0 11 29
in 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
Mercer 0 11 29
schools 0 11 29
are 0 11 29
similar 0 11 29
to 0 11 29
what 0 11 29
a 0 11 29
child 0 11 29
would 0 11 29
hear 0 11 29
in 0 11 29
Sunday 0 11 29
school 0 11 29
and 0 11 29
that 0 11 29
they 0 11 29
advocate 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
Ten 0 11 29
Commandments 0 11 29
and 0 11 29
treat 0 11 29
stories 0 11 29
in 0 11 29
the 0 11 29
Bible 0 11 29
as 0 11 29
historical 0 11 29

fact. 0 11 30
The 0 11 30
suit 0 11 30
quotes 0 11 30
from 0 11 30
one 0 11 30
lesson: 0 11 30
“If 0 11 30
all 0 11 30
of 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
Israelites 0 11 30
had 0 11 30
chosen 0 11 30
to 0 11 30
follow 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
Ten 0 11 30
Commandments, 0 11 30
think 0 11 30
of 0 11 30
how 0 11 30
safe 0 11 30
and 0 11 30
happy 0 11 30
they 0 11 30
would 0 11 30
have 0 11 30
been.” 0 11 30
Another 0 11 30
lesson 0 11 30
asks 0 11 30
students 0 11 30
to 0 11 30
imagine 0 11 30
that 0 11 30
humans 0 11 30
and 0 11 30
dinosaurs 0 11 30
existed 0 11 30
at 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
same 0 11 30

time. 0 11 31
It 0 11 31
says: 0 11 31
“So 0 11 31
picture 0 11 31
Adam 0 11 31
being 0 11 31
able 0 11 31
to 0 11 31
crawl 0 11 31
up 0 11 31
on 0 11 31
the 0 11 31
back 0 11 31
of 0 11 31
a 0 11 31
dinosaur! 0 11 31

He 0 11 32
and 0 11 32
Eve 0 11 32
could 0 11 32
have 0 11 32
their 0 11 32

slide! 0 11 33
Wouldn’t 0 11 33
that 0 11 33
be 0 11 33
so 0 11 33

wild!” 0 11 34
The 0 11 34
district 0 11 34
declined 0 11 34
a 0 11 34
request 0 11 34
to 0 11 34
observe 0 11 34
one 0 11 34
of 0 11 34
the 0 11 34

classes. 0 11 35
Elizabeth 0 11 35
Deal, 0 11 35
who 0 11 35
describes 0 11 35
herself 0 11 35
as 0 11 35
agnostic, 0 11 35
is 0 11 35
one 0 11 35
of 0 11 35
the 0 11 35
plaintiffs 0 11 35
in 0 11 35

the 0 11 36
case. 0 11 36
Her 0 11 36
daughter 0 11 36
attended 0 11 36
elementary 0 11 36
school 0 11 36
in 0 11 36
nearby 0 11 36
Bluefield, 0 11 36
but 0 11 36
Deal 0 11 36
kept 0 11 36
her 0 11 36
out 0 11 36
of 0 11 36
the 0 11 36
Bible 0 11 36

class. 0 11 37
Even 0 11 37
though 0 11 37
the 0 11 37
class 0 11 37
was 0 11 37
optional, 0 11 37
Deal 0 11 37
said 0 11 37
there 0 11 37
weren’t 0 11 37
any 0 11 37
alternative 0 11 37
lessons 0 11 37
or 0 11 37
activities 0 11 37
for 0 11 37
those 0 11 37
who 0 11 37
opted 0 11 37

out. 0 11 38
Her 0 11 38
daughter 0 11 38
was 0 11 38
told 0 11 38
to 0 11 38
sit 0 11 38
in 0 11 38
the 0 11 38
computer 0 11 38
lab 0 11 38
for 0 11 38
that 0 11 38
half-hour 0 11 38
and 0 11 38
read 0 11 38

a 0 11 39
book. 0 11 39
Bypassing 1 11 39
the 1 11 39
class 1 11 39
left 1 11 39
her 1 11 39
vulnerable 1 11 39
to 1 11 39

bullying. 1 11 40
Deal 0 11 40
said 0 11 40
other 0 11 40
students 0 11 40
told 0 11 40
her 0 11 40
daughter 0 11 40
that 0 11 40
she 0 11 40
was 0 11 40
going 1 11 40

to 1 11 41
hell. 1 11 41
One 0 11 41
day 0 11 41
a 0 11 41
student 0 11 41
saw 0 11 41
her 0 11 41
daughter 0 11 41
reading 0 11 41
a 0 11 41
“Harry 0 11 41
Potter” 0 11 41
novel 0 11 41
and 0 11 41
told 0 11 41
her, 0 11 41
according 0 11 41
to 0 11 41
the 0 11 41
mother: 0 11 41
“You 1 11 41
don’t 1 11 41
need 1 11 41
to 1 11 41
be 1 11 41
reading 1 11 41

this. 1 11 42
You 1 11 42
need 1 11 42
to 1 11 42
be 1 11 42
reading 1 11 42
the 1 11 42

Bible.” 1 11 43
Eventually 0 11 43
Deal 0 11 43
moved 0 11 43
her 0 11 43
daughter 0 11 43
to 0 11 43
a 0 11 43
public 0 11 43
school 0 11 43
a 0 11 43
few 0 11 43
miles 0 11 43
away 0 11 43
in 0 11 43
Virginia 0 11 43
where 0 11 43
there 0 11 43
is 0 11 43
no 0 11 43
Bible 0 11 43

class. 0 11 44
She 0 11 44
pays 0 11 44
an 0 11 44
out-of-state 0 11 44
fee 0 11 44
of 0 11 44
several 0 11 44
hundred 0 11 44
dollars, 0 11 44
but 0 11 44
she 0 11 44
no 0 11 44
longer 0 11 44
worries 0 11 44
about 0 11 44
her 0 11 44
child 0 11 44
being 0 11 44

taunted. 0 11 45
Deal 0 11 45
said 0 11 45
she 0 11 45

a 0 12 4
highly 0 12 4
unusual 0 12 4
step. 0 12 4

Among 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
guidelines 0 12 5
was 0 12 5
a 0 12 5
restriction 0 12 5
of 0 12 5
one 0 12 5
question 0 12 5

official 0 12 5
at 0 12 5
the 0 12 5

“Failure 0 12 6
to 0 12 6
abide,” 0 12 6
the 0 12 6
administration 0 12 6
warned, 0 12 6
“may 0 12 6

in 0 12 6
suspension 0 12 6
or 0 12 6
revocation 0 12 6
of 0 12 6
the 0 12 6
journalist’s 0 12 6
hard 0 12 6
pass.” 0 12 6

The 0 12 7
White 0 12 7
House 0 12 7
sought 0 12 7
to 0 12 7
blame 0 12 7
Mr. 0 12 7
Acosta 0 12 7
for 0 12 7
behaving 0 12 7
disrespectfully, 0 12 7
although 0 12 7
Mr. 0 12 7
Trump 0 12 7
often 0 12 7
lobs 0 12 7
insults 1 12 7
at 0 12 7
journalists 0 12 7
and 0 12 7
encourages 0 12 7
a 0 12 7
free-for-all 0 12 7
format 0 12 7
when 0 12 7
taking 0 12 7
questions 0 12 7

reporters. 0 12 7

Codifying 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
behavior 0 12 8
of 0 12 8
journalists 0 12 8
struck 0 12 8
some 0 12 8
as 0 12 8
an 0 12 8
ominous 1 12 8
encroachment 1 12 8
into 0 12 8
freedom 0 12 8
of 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
press, 0 12 8
and 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
White 0 12 8
House 0 12 8
Correspondents’ 0 12 8
Association 0 12 8
said 0 12 8
on 0 12 8
Monday 0 12 8
that 0 12 8
it 0 12 8
had 0 12 8
not 0 12 8
been 0 12 8
consulted 0 12 8
about 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
new 0 12 8
guidelines. 0 12 8

The 0 12 9
American 0 12 9
Civil 0 12 9
Liberties 0 12 9
Union, 0 12 9
in 0 12 9
a 0 12 9
statement, 0 12 9
said: 0 12 9
“These 0 12 9
rules 0 12 9
give 0 12 9
the 0 12 9
White 0 12 9
House 0 12 9
far 0 12 9
too 0 12 9
much 0 12 9
discretion 0 12 9
to 0 12 9
avoid 0 12 9
real 0 12 9
scrutiny. 0 12 9

The 0 12 10
White 0 12 10
House 0 12 10
belongs 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
public, 0 12 10
not 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
president, 0 12 10
and 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
job 0 12 10
of 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
press 0 12 10
is 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
ask 0 12 10
hard 0 12 10
questions, 0 12 10
not 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
be 0 12 10
polite 0 12 10
company.” 0 12 10

Still, 0 12 11
the 0 12 11
guidelines 0 12 11
are 0 12 11
not 0 12 11
far 0 12 11
removed 0 12 11
from 0 12 11
the 0 12 11
manner 0 12 11
in 0 12 11
which 0 12 11
White 0 12 11
House 0 12 11
news 0 12 11
conferences 0 12 11
typically 0 12 11
proceed. 0 12 11

Mr. 0 12 12
Trump 0 12 12
made 0 12 12
clear 0 12 12
last 0 12 12
week 0 12 12
that 0 12 12
he 0 12 12
would 0 12 12
introduce 0 12 12
“regulations” 0 12 12
after 0 12 12
a 0 12 12
federal 0 12 12
judge 0 12 12
criticized 0 12 12
the 0 12 12
White 0 12 12
House 0 12 12
for 0 12 12
stripping 0 12 12
Mr. 0 12 12
Acosta’s 0 12 12
credentials 0 12 12
without 0 12 12
due 0 12 12
process 0 12 12
or 0 12 12
a 0 12 12
coherent 0 12 12
rationale. 0 12 12

“We 0 12 13
would 0 12 13
have 0 12 13
greatly 0 12 13
preferred 0 12 13

hosting 0 12 13
White 0 12 13

and 0 12 13
we 0 12 13
believe 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
overwhelming 0 12 13

of 0 12 13
journalists 0 12 13
covering 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
White 0 12 13
House 0 12 13
share 0 12 13
that 0 12 13
preference,” 0 12 13
Sarah 0 12 13
Huckabee 0 12 13
Sanders, 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
press 0 12 13
secretary, 0 12 13
said 0 12 13
in 0 12 13
a 0 12 13
statement. 0 12 13

Press 0 12 14
relations 0 12 14
were 0 12 14
not 0 12 14
always 0 12 14
rosy 0 12 14
in 0 12 14
pre-Trump 0 12 14

days. 0 12 15
President 0 12 15
Barack 0 12 15
Obama’s 0 12 15
aides 0 12 15
preselected 0 12 15
the 0 12 15
news 0 12 15
outlets 0 12 15
that 0 12 15
were 0 12 15
allowed 0 12 15
to 0 12 15
ask 0 12 15
questions 0 12 15
at 0 12 15
his 0 12 15
news 0 12 15
conferences. 0 12 15

Mr. 0 12 16
Obama 0 12 16
often 0 12 16
chastised 0 12 16
reporters, 0 12 16
including 0 12 16
Mr. 0 12 16
Acosta 0 12 16
on 0 12 16
one 0 12 16
occasion, 0 12 16
for 0 12 16
questions 0 12 16
he 0 12 16
deemed 0 12 16
overly 1 12 16
aggressive 1 12 16
or 0 12 16
grandstanding. 1 12 16

But 0 12 17
Mr. 0 12 17
Trump, 0 12 17
a 0 12 17
devoted 1 12 17
news 1 12 17
consumer 1 12 17
who 0 12 17
relishes 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
coverage, 0 12 17
plays 0 12 17
up 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
conflicts 0 12 17
with 0 12 17
reporters 0 12 17
in 0 12 17
part 0 12 17
to 0 12 17
excite 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
supporters. 0 12 17

He 0 12 18
has 0 12 18
held 0 12 18
far 0 12 18
fewer 0 12 18
formal 0 12 18
news 0 12 18
conferences 0 12 18
than 0 12 18
his 0 12 18

the 0 12 18
daily 0 12 18
White 0 12 18

Mr. 0 12 19
Acosta’s 0 12 19
White 0 12 19

was 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
most 0 12 19
severe 1 12 19
step 0 12 19
yet, 0 12 19
and 0 12 19
it 0 12 19
soon 0 12 19
became 0 12 19
apparent 0 12 19
that 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
move 0 12 19
would 0 12 19
not 0 12 19

After 0 12 19
suing 0 12 19
last 0 12 19
week, 0 12 19
Mr. 0 12 19
Acosta 0 12 19
was 0 12 19
granted 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
temporary 0 12 19
return 0 12 19
of 0 12 19
his 0 12 19

by 0 12 19
a 0 12 19
federal 0 12 19

A 0 12 20
back-and-forth 0 12 20

over 0 12 20
the 0 12 20

a 0 12 21
letter 0 12 21
to 0 12 21
Mr. 0 12 21
Acosta 0 12 21
that 0 12 21
listed 0 12 21
several 0 12 21
reasons 0 12 21
that 0 12 21
his 0 12 21
pass 0 12 21
had 0 12 21
been 0 12 21
revoked, 0 12 21
perhaps 0 12 21
an 0 12 21
attempt 0 12 21
to 0 12 21
satisfy 0 12 21
the 0 12 21
judge’s 0 12 21
request 0 12 21
for 0 12 21
a 0 12 21
clear 0 12 21
rationale. 0 12 21

CNN’s 0 12 22

the 0 12 22
note 0 12 22

By 0 12 22
Monday 0 12 22
afternoon, 0 12 22
the 0 12 22
sides 0 12 22

resolution. 0 12 22

Aides 0 12 23
to 0 12 23
Mr. 0 12 23
Trump 0 12 23
say 0 12 23
that 0 12 23
the 0 12 23
president 0 12 23
does 0 12 23
not 0 12 23
mind 0 12 23
answering 0 12 23
questions, 0 12 23
pointing 0 12 23
to 0 12 23
his 0 12 23
numerous 0 12 23
impromptu 0 12 23

setting, 0 12 24
even 0 12 24
as 0 12 24
Mr. 0 12 24

wrote 0 12 25
on 0 12 25
Monday, 0 12 25
suggesting 0 12 25
that 0 12 25
the 0 12 25

was 0 12 25
on 0 12 25
the 0 12 25
press 0 12 25
corps 0 12 25
to 0 12 25

that 0 12 25
a 0 12 25
“code 0 12 25
of 0 12 25
conduct” 0 12 25
did 0 12 25
not 0 12 25

necessary. 0 12 26
That 0 12 26
notion 0 12 26
read 0 12 26
more 0 12 26

focused 0 14 19
on 0 14 19
“the 1 14 19
white 1 14 19
man” 1 14 19
as 1 14 19
“the 1 14 19
white 1 14 19
devil”). 1 14 19

But 0 14 20
in 0 14 20
1967, 0 14 20
it 0 14 20
became 0 14 20
outspokenly 1 14 20
and 1 14 20
flagrantly 1 14 20
anti-Zionist, 1 14 20
in 0 14 20
an 0 14 20
expression 0 14 20
of 0 14 20
solidarity 0 14 20
with 0 14 20
Palestinians. 0 14 20

That 0 14 21
political 0 14 21
position 0 14 21
became 0 14 21
a 0 14 21
vehicle 0 14 21
for 0 14 21
Mr. 0 14 21
Farrakhan 0 14 21
to 0 14 21
express 0 14 21
his 0 14 21
anti-Semitism. 0 14 21

(Among 0 14 22
his 0 14 22

In 0 14 23
1975, 0 14 23
when 0 14 23
Elijah 0 14 23

the 0 14 23
Nation 0 14 23
split 0 14 23
into 0 14 23
two 0 14 23

The 0 14 24
faction 0 14 24
reconstituted 0 14 24

in 0 14 24
the 0 14 24

not 0 14 24

that 0 14 24
it 0 14 24

when 0 14 24

“virtually 0 14 26

then 0 14 26
drew 0 14 26
national 0 14 26
attention 0 14 26
in 0 14 26
1984, 0 14 26

Mr. 0 14 28

but 0 14 28
the 0 14 28

Obama's 0 17 5
disastrous 1 17 5
nuclear 0 17 5
deal 0 17 5
with 0 17 5
Iran 0 17 5
legitimized 1 17 5
Iran's 1 17 5
path 1 17 5
to 1 17 5
eventually 1 17 5
becoming 1 17 5
a 1 17 5
nuclear-armed 1 17 5
state, 1 17 5
while 0 17 5
immediately 0 17 5
filling 0 17 5
its 0 17 5
coffers 0 17 5
with 0 17 5
billions 0 17 5
of 0 17 5
dollars 0 17 5
to 0 17 5
fund 0 17 5
its 0 17 5
aggression. 0 17 5

Meanwhile, 0 17 6
Syria 0 17 6
has 0 17 6
become 0 17 6
ground 0 17 6
zero 0 17 6
for 0 17 6
Iran's 0 17 6
execution 0 17 6
of 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
regional 0 17 6
ambitions, 0 17 6
which 0 17 6
is 0 17 6
to 0 17 6
establish 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
Shiite 0 17 6
Crescent 0 17 6
connecting 0 17 6
with 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
allies, 0 17 6
including 0 17 6
Iraq, 0 17 6
Syria 0 17 6
and 0 17 6
Lebanon. 0 17 6

This 0 17 7
plan 0 17 7
has 0 17 7
included 0 17 7
the 0 17 7
establishment 0 17 7
of 0 17 7
a 0 17 7
land 0 17 7
route 0 17 7
that 0 17 7
Iranian-backed 0 17 7
militias 0 17 7
secured 0 17 7
in 0 17 7
June, 0 17 7
beginning 0 17 7
on 0 17 7
Iran’s 0 17 7
border 0 17 7
with 0 17 7
Iraq 0 17 7
and 0 17 7
running 0 17 7
across 0 17 7
Iraq 0 17 7
and 0 17 7
Syria 0 17 7
all 0 17 7
the 0 17 7
way 0 17 7
to 0 17 7
Syria’s 0 17 7
Mediterranean 0 17 7
coast. 0 17 7

This 0 17 8
road 0 17 8
makes 0 17 8
Iran’s 0 17 8
job 0 17 8
easier 0 17 8
in 0 17 8
supplying 0 17 8
arms 0 17 8
by 0 17 8
land, 0 17 8
as 0 17 8
well 0 17 8
as 0 17 8
by 0 17 8
air 0 17 8
and 0 17 8
sea, 0 17 8
to 0 17 8
prop 0 17 8
up 0 17 8
Syrian 0 17 8
President 0 17 8
Bashar 0 17 8
al-Assad’s 0 17 8
regime 0 17 8
and 0 17 8
to 0 17 8
equip 0 17 8
Iran’s 0 17 8
own 0 17 8
forces 0 17 8
fighting 0 17 8
inside 0 17 8
of 0 17 8
Syria 0 17 8
in 0 17 8
support 0 17 8
of 0 17 8
Assad. 0 17 8

This 0 17 9
helps 0 17 9
explain 0 17 9
why 0 17 9
Iran 0 17 9
has 0 17 9
placed 0 17 9
so 0 17 9
much 0 17 9
importance 0 17 9
on 0 17 9
helping 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Syrian 0 17 9
regime 0 17 9
establish 0 17 9
control 0 17 9
over 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Deir 0 17 9
ez-Zor 0 17 9
area 0 17 9
in 0 17 9
eastern 0 17 9
Syria, 0 17 9
near 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Iraqi 0 17 9
border. 0 17 9

“Everything 0 17 10
depends 0 17 10
now 0 17 10
on 0 17 10
the 0 17 10
Americans’ 0 17 10
willingness 0 17 10
to 0 17 10
stop 0 17 10
this,” 0 17 10
said 0 17 10
an 0 17 10
Iraqi 0 17 10
Kurdish 0 17 10
official 0 17 10
who 0 17 10
was 0 17 10
quoted 0 17 10
in 0 17 10
a 0 17 10
New 0 17 10

article. 0 17 10

However, 0 17 11
U.S.-led 0 17 11
coalition 0 17 11
forces 0 17 11
apparently 0 17 11
have 0 17 11
done 0 17 11
next 0 17 11
to 0 17 11
nothing 0 17 11
to 0 17 11
stop 0 17 11
this 0 17 11
major 0 17 11
advance 0 17 11
in 0 17 11
Iran’s 0 17 11
Shiite 0 17 11
Crescent 0 17 11
expansion. 0 17 11

“Obama 0 17 12
ran 0 17 12
down 0 17 12
our 0 17 12
options 0 17 12
in 0 17 12
Syria 0 17 12
so 0 17 12
thoroughly, 0 17 12
by 0 17 12
the 0 17 12
time 0 17 12
this 0 17 12
administration 0 17 12
took 0 17 12
over,” 0 17 12
said 0 17 12
Andrew 0 17 12
Tabler, 0 17 12
senior 0 17 12
fellow 0 17 12
at 0 17 12
the 0 17 12
Washington 0 17 12
Institute 0 17 12
for 0 17 12
Near 0 17 12
East 0 17 12
Policy. 0 17 12

“The 0 17 13
Iranian 0 17 13
influence 0 17 13
is 0 17 13
spreading 0 17 13
because 0 17 13
they 0 17 13
are 0 17 13
so 0 17 13
heavily 0 17 13
involved 0 17 13
in 0 17 13
regime 0 17 13
activities,” 0 17 13
Tabler 0 17 13
added. 0 17 13

“It’s 1 17 14
a 1 17 14
new 1 17 14
monster.” 1 17 14

Furthermore, 0 17 15
Iran 0 17 15
has 0 17 15
funded 0 17 15
and 0 17 15
armed 0 17 15
its 0 17 15
terrorist 0 17 15
proxy 0 17 15
Hezbollah, 0 17 15
which 0 17 15
has 0 17 15
sent 0 17 15
its 0 17 15
militia 0 17 15
from 0 17 15
its 0 17 15
home 0 17 15
base 0 17 15
of 0 17 15
Lebanon 0 17 15
to 0 17 15
fight 0 17 15
alongside 0 17 15
Assad's 0 17 15
forces. 0 17 15

And 0 17 16
Iran 0 17 16
has 0 17 16
used 0 17 16
Syria 0 17 16
as 0 17 16
a 0 17 16
transit 0 17 16
point 0 17 16
for 0 17 16
shipment 0 17 16
of 0 17 16
sophisticated 0 17 16
rockets 0 17 16
to 0 17 16
Hezbollah 0 17 16
in 0 17 16
Lebanon 0 17 16
for 0 17 16
future 0 17 16
use 0 17 16
against 0 17 16
Israeli 0 17 16
population 0 17 16
centers. 0 17 16

Despite 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
fact 0 17 17
that 0 17 17
Hezbollah 0 17 17
has 0 17 17
American 1 17 17
blood 1 17 17
on 0 17 17
its 0 17 17
hands, 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
U.S.-led 0 17 17
coalition 0 17 17
has 0 17 17
chosen 0 17 17
not 0 17 17
to 0 17 17
do 0 17 17
anything 0 17 17
about 0 17 17
Hezbollah’s 0 17 17
presence 0 17 17
in 0 17 17
Syria, 0 17 17
bought 0 17 17
and 0 17 17
paid 0 17 17
for 0 17 17
by 0 17 17
Iran. 0 17 17

While 0 17 18
Israel 0 17 18
chose 0 17 18
not 0 17 18
to 0 17 18
take 0 17 18
sides 0 17 18
in 0 17 18
Syria's 0 17 18
civil 0 17 18
war 0 17 18
with 0 17 18
military 0 17 18
intervention 0 17 18
of 0 17 18
its 0 17 18

it 0 17 18
has 0 17 18
bombed 0 17 18
weapons 0 17 18
storage 0 17 18
facilities 0 17 18
and 0 17 18
convoys 0 17 18
inside 0 17 18
Syria 0 17 18
for 0 17 18
its 0 17 18
own 0 17 18
protection. 0 17 18

Just 0 17 19
recently, 0 17 19
on 0 17 19
September 0 17 19
7th, 0 17 19
Israeli 0 17 19
jets 0 17 19
struck 0 17 19
a 0 17 19
Syrian 0 17 19
weapons 0 17 19
facility 0 17 19
near 0 17 19
Masyaf, 0 17 19
which 0 17 19
was 0 17 19
reported 0 17 19
to 0 17 19
have 0 17 19
been 0 17 19
used 0 17 19
for 0 17 19
the 0 17 19
production 0 17 19
of 0 17 19
chemical 0 17 19
weapons 0 17 19
and 0 17 19
the 0 17 19
storage 0 17 19
of 0 17 19
missiles. 0 17 19

Israel 0 17 20
will 0 17 20
also 0 17 20
do 0 17 20
what 0 17 20
is 0 17 20
necessary 0 17 20
to 0 17 20
repel 0 17 20
Iranian-backed 0 17 20
forces 0 17 20
if 0 17 20
they 0 17 20
edge 0 17 20
too 0 17 20
close 0 17 20
to 0 17 20
areas 0 17 20
near 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
Golan 0 17 20
Heights, 0 17 20
shrinking 0 17 20
the 0 17 20
buffer 0 17 20
between 0 17 20
Israel 0 17 20
and 0 17 20
Iranian 0 17 20
controlled 0 17 20
territories. 0 17 20

However, 0 17 21
such 0 17 21
tactical 0 17 21
measures 0 17 21
may 0 17 21
not 0 17 21
be 0 17 21
enough 0 17 21
to 0 17 21
thwart 0 17 21
Iran’s 0 17 21
larger 0 17 21
ambitions. 0 17 21

In 0 17 22
light 0 17 22
of 0 17 22
intelligence 0 17 22
reports 0 17 22
that 0 17 22
Assad 0 17 22
may 0 17 22
be 0 17 22
ready 0 17 22
to 0 17 22
invite 0 17 22
Iran 0 17 22
to 0 17 22
set 0 17 22
up 0 17 22
military 0 17 22
bases 0 17 22

Syria, 0 17 22
Israeli 0 17 22

continued 0 18 5

said 0 18 6
Rick, 0 18 6
before 0 18 6
making 0 18 6
the 0 18 6
extraordinary 0 18 6
claim 0 18 6
that 0 18 6
the 0 18 6
whole 0 18 6
shooting 0 18 6
was 0 18 6
a 0 18 6
“set 0 18 6
up” 0 18 6
and 0 18 6
that 0 18 6
Paddock’s 1 18 6
body 1 18 6
may 1 18 6
have 1 18 6
been 1 18 6
left 1 18 6

while 1 18 6
other 1 18 6

carried 1 18 6
out 1 18 6
the 1 18 6
shooting. 1 18 6

The 0 18 7
caller 0 18 7
mentioned 0 18 7
how 0 18 7
some 0 18 7
people 0 18 7
in 0 18 7
the 0 18 7
crowd 0 18 7
were 0 18 7
warned 0 18 7
45 0 18 7
minutes 0 18 7
before 0 18 7
the 0 18 7
shooting 0 18 7
that 0 18 7
they 0 18 7
were 0 18 7
going 0 18 7
to 0 18 7
die, 0 18 7
suggesting 0 18 7
that 0 18 7
this 0 18 7
was 0 18 7
evidence 0 18 7
of 0 18 7
a 0 18 7
wider 0 18 7
plot 0 18 7
and 0 18 7
not 0 18 7
a 0 18 7
“lone 0 18 7
wolf” 0 18 7
attack. 0 18 7

As 0 18 8
a 0 18 8
firearms 0 18 8
expert, 0 18 8
he 0 18 8
also 0 18 8
questioned 0 18 8
the 0 18 8
lack 0 18 8
of 0 18 8
flashes 0 18 8
coming 0 18 8
from 0 18 8
the 0 18 8
hotel 0 18 8
windows 0 18 8
where 0 18 8
the 0 18 8
shooter 0 18 8
was 0 18 8
supposedly 0 18 8
firing 0 18 8
from. 0 18 8

Rick 0 18 9
said 0 18 9
he 0 18 9
had 0 18 9
already 0 18 9
contacted 0 18 9
the 0 18 9
Clark 0 18 9
County 0 18 9
Sheriff’s 0 18 9
Office 0 18 9
to 0 18 9
relay 0 18 9
all 0 18 9
the 0 18 9
information 0 18 9
he 0 18 9
knew. 0 18 9

Although 0 18 10
the 0 18 10
claims 0 18 10
are 0 18 10
intriguing, 0 18 10
it 0 18 10
is 0 18 10
important 0 18 10
to 0 18 10
remember 0 18 10
that 0 18 10
after 1 18 10
virtually 1 18 10
every 1 18 10
terror 1 18 10
attack 1 18 10
and 1 18 10
mass 1 18 10
shooting, 1 18 10
friends 1 18 10
and 1 18 10
neighbors 1 18 10
express 1 18 10
shock 1 18 10
that 0 18 10
the 0 18 10
culprit 0 18 10
would 0 18 10
be 0 18 10
capable 0 18 10
of 0 18 10
carrying 0 18 10
out 0 18 10
such 0 18 10
horrors, 0 18 10
with 0 18 10
some 0 18 10
outright 0 18 10
denying 0 18 10
it 0 18 10
to 0 18 10
be 0 18 10
possible. 0 18 10

If 0 18 11
Paddock 0 18 11
was 0 18 11
planning 0 18 11
such 0 18 11
a 0 18 11
sophisticated 0 18 11
operation 0 18 11
and 0 18 11
hoping 0 18 11
to 0 18 11
evade 0 18 11
detection, 0 18 11
he 0 18 11
would 0 18 11
not 0 18 11
be 0 18 11
blabbing 0 18 11
details 0 18 11
about 0 18 11
it 0 18 11
to 0 18 11
his 0 18 11
neighbors. 0 18 11

However, 0 18 12
the 0 18 12
neighbor’s 0 18 12
claims 0 18 12
are 0 18 12
certain 0 18 12
to 0 18 12
attract 0 18 12
more 0 18 12
attention 0 18 12
given 0 18 12
that 0 18 12
no 0 18 12
specific 0 18 12
motive 0 18 12
has 0 18 12
yet 0 18 12
to 0 18 12
be 0 18 12
uncovered 0 18 12
for 0 18 12
the 0 18 12
shooting. 0 18 12

That’s 0 20 12
right, 0 20 12
photographic 0 20 12
evidence 0 20 12
from 0 20 12
inside 0 20 12
the 0 20 12
hotel 0 20 12
parking 0 20 12
garage 0 20 12
has 0 20 12
confirmed 0 20 12
that 0 20 12
the 0 20 12
FBI, 0 20 12
along 0 20 12
with 0 20 12
state 0 20 12
and 0 20 12
local 0 20 12

specifically 0 20 12
lied 0 20 12
about 0 20 12
key 0 20 12
details 0 20 12
of 0 20 12
the 0 20 12
shooting. 0 20 12

This 1 20 13
throws 1 20 13
their 1 20 13
entire 1 20 13
narrative 1 20 13
into 1 20 13
question 1 20 13
and 1 20 13
makes 1 20 13
one 1 20 13
wonder 1 20 13
what 1 20 13
else 1 20 13
is 1 20 13
being 1 20 13
hidden 1 20 13
from 1 20 13
the 1 20 13
public? 1 20 13

Keep 0 20 14
in 0 20 14
mind 0 20 14
that 0 20 14
at 0 20 14
least 0 20 14
four 0 20 14
videos 0 20 14
from 0 20 14
the 0 20 14
scene 0 20 14
of 0 20 14
the 0 20 14
shooting 0 20 14
have 0 20 14
already 0 20 14
been 0 20 14
released 0 20 14
that 0 20 14
indicate 0 20 14
there 0 20 14
were 0 20 14
multiple 0 20 14
shooters. 0 20 14

In 0 20 15
fact, 0 20 15
there 0 20 15
are 0 20 15
so 0 20 15
many 0 20 15
unanswered 0 20 15
questions 0 20 15
that 0 20 15
the 0 20 15
Drudge 0 20 15
Report 0 20 15
even 0 20 15
linked 0 20 15
to 0 20 15
an 0 20 15
article 0 20 15
asking 0 20 15
them 0 20 15
directly. 0 20 15

As 0 20 16
noted 0 20 16
above, 0 20 16
at 0 20 16
this 0 20 16
point 0 20 16
literally 0 20 16
every 0 20 16
piece 0 20 16
of 0 20 16
so-called 1 20 16
evidence 1 20 16
put 0 20 16
forth 0 20 16
by 0 20 16
authorities 0 20 16
and 0 20 16
then 0 20 16
regurgitated 0 20 16
by 0 20 16
the 0 20 16
mainstream 0 20 16
media 0 20 16
cannot 1 20 16
be 1 20 16
trusted 1 20 16
and 1 20 16
should 1 20 16
be 1 20 16
considered 1 20 16
as 1 20 16
disinformation 1 20 16
until 0 20 16
proven 0 20 16
otherwise. 0 20 16

And 0 20 17
if 0 20 17
Paddock 0 20 17
really 0 20 17
did 0 20 17
act 0 20 17
alone 0 20 17
and 0 20 17
this 0 20 17
evidence 0 20 17
is 0 20 17
some 0 20 17
sort 0 20 17
of 0 20 17
mistake, 0 20 17
there 0 20 17
is 0 20 17
surely 0 20 17
video 0 20 17
footage 0 20 17
proving 0 20 17
so. 0 20 17

So 0 234 17
which 0 234 17

it? 0 234 17

Does 0 234 18
Ramadan 0 234 18
remind 0 234 18
us 0 234 18
of 0 234 18
“the 0 234 18

or 0 234 18
is 0 234 18
Ramadan 0 234 18
“a 0 234 18
month 0 234 18
of 0 234 18
calamity 0 234 18
everywhere 0 234 18
for 0 234 18
nonbelievers”? 0 234 18

Islam’s 1 234 19
core 1 234 19
beliefs 1 234 19
make 1 234 19
it 1 234 19
clear 1 234 19
that 1 234 19
the 1 234 19
latter 1 234 19
statement 1 234 19
is 1 234 19
closer 1 234 19
to 1 234 19
the 1 234 19
truth. 1 234 19

During 0 234 20
Ramadan, 0 234 20
Muslims 0 234 20
are 0 234 20
exhorted 0 234 20
to 0 234 20
renew 0 234 20
and 0 234 20
deepen 0 234 20
their 0 234 20
devotion 0 234 20
to 0 234 20
Allah. 0 234 20

Hence 0 234 21
it 0 234 21
is 0 234 21
a 0 234 21
time 0 234 21
when 0 234 21
they’re 0 234 21
supposed 0 234 21
to 0 234 21
grow 0 234 21
more 0 234 21
generous 0 234 21
and 0 234 21
kind 0 234 21
toward 0 234 21
their 0 234 21
fellow 0 234 21
Muslims. 0 234 21

However, 0 234 22
the 0 234 22
Qur’an 0 234 22
says: 0 234 22
“Muhammad 0 234 22
is 0 234 22
the 0 234 22
Messenger 0 234 22
of 0 234 22
Allah, 0 234 22
and 0 234 22
those 0 234 22
who 0 234 22
are 0 234 22
with 0 234 22
him 0 234 22
are 0 234 22
severe 1 234 22
against 1 234 22
disbelievers, 0 234 22
and 0 234 22
merciful 0 234 22
among 0 234 22
themselves” 0 234 22
(48:29). 0 234 22

If 0 234 23
the 0 234 23
Ramadan 0 234 23
imperative 0 234 23
is 0 234 23
to 0 234 23
become 0 234 23
more 0 234 23
devout, 0 234 23
the 0 234 23
Muslim 0 234 23
who 0 234 23
applies 0 234 23
himself 0 234 23
diligently 0 234 23
to 0 234 23
the 0 234 23
Ramadan 0 234 23
observance 0 234 23
will 0 234 23
simultaneously 0 234 23
become 0 234 23
more 0 234 23
both 0 234 23
merciful 0 234 23
to 0 234 23
his 0 234 23
fellow 0 234 23
Muslims 0 234 23
and 0 234 23
more 1 234 23
severe 1 234 23
against 1 234 23
the 0 234 23
unbelievers. 0 234 23

Murdering 1 234 24
infidels 1 234 24
thus 1 234 24
doesn’t 1 234 24
contradict 1 234 24
the 1 234 24
spirit 1 234 24
of 1 234 24
Ramadan; 1 234 24
it 1 234 24
embodies 1 234 24
it. 1 234 24

back 0 234 25
to 0 234 25
Muhammad’s 0 234 25
time: 0 234 25

The 0 234 26

Trump 0 234 27
was, 0 234 27
unfortunately, 0 234 27
following 0 234 27
the 0 234 27
example 0 234 27

is 0 234 28
likely 0 234 28
to 0 234 28
fail 0 234 28
to 0 234 28
satisfy 0 234 28
Muslims, 0 234 28
or 0 234 28
anyone. 0 234 28

After 0 234 29
all, 0 234 29
after 0 234 29
the 0 234 29
Trump 0 234 29
White 0 234 29
House 0 234 29
issued 0 234 29
a 0 234 29
similar 0 234 29
statement 0 234 29
last 0 234 29
year, 0 234 29
the 0 234 29
Washington 0 234 29
Post 0 234 29
ran 0 234 29
a 0 234 29
lengthy 0 234 29
piece 0 234 29
in 0 234 29
which 0 234 29
several 0 234 29
Muslims 0 234 29
explained 0 234 29
why 0 234 29
the 0 234 29
statement 0 234 29
was 0 234 29
unsatisfactory 0 234 29
to 0 234 29
them. 0 234 29

Shadi 0 234 30
Hamid 0 234 30
of 0 234 30
the 0 234 30
Qatar-funded 0 234 30
Brookings 0 234 30
Institution 0 234 30
declared: 0 234 30
“Trump 1 234 30
has 1 234 30
so 1 234 30
rarely 1 234 30
recognized 1 234 30
that 1 234 30
American 1 234 30
Muslims 1 234 30
even 1 234 30
exist, 1 234 30
but 1 234 30
this 1 234 30
offers 1 234 30
apparent 1 234 30
proof 1 234 30
that 1 234 30
he 1 234 30
is 1 234 30
aware 1 234 30
of 1 234 30
our 1 234 30
existence. 1 234 30

Great! 1 234 31

Putting 0 234 32
all 0 234 32
that 0 234 32
context 0 234 32
aside, 0 234 32
it’s 0 234 32
offensive 0 234 32
and 0 234 32
pretty 1 234 32
much 1 234 32
terrible.” 1 234 32

Why? 0 234 33

Because 0 234 34
Trump 0 234 34
had 0 234 34
the 0 234 34
temerity 0 234 34
to 0 234 34
mention 0 234 34
jihad 0 234 34
terrorism. 0 234 34

Hamid 0 234 35
continued: 0 234 35
“We, 0 234 35
as 0 234 35
American 0 234 35
Muslims, 0 234 35
shouldn’t 0 234 35
be 0 234 35
defined 0 234 35
solely 0 234 35
in 0 234 35
our 0 234 35
relationship 0 234 35
to 0 234 35
bad 0 234 35
things 0 234 35
that 0 234 35
we 0 234 35
have 0 234 35
nothing 0 234 35
to 0 234 35
do 0 234 35
with. 0 234 35

We’re 0 234 36
also 0 234 36
normal 0 234 36
people 0 234 36
who 0 234 36
happen 0 234 36
to 0 234 36
be 0 234 36
Muslim 0 234 36
and 0 234 36
to 0 234 36
see 0 234 36
us 0 234 36
and 0 234 36
our 0 234 36
history 0 234 36
in 0 234 36
America 0 234 36
so 0 234 36
narrowly 0 234 36
is 0 234 36
plain 1 234 36
out 1 234 36
offensive.” 1 234 36

What 1 234 37
is 1 234 37
actually 1 234 37
offensive 1 234 37
is 1 234 37
that 1 234 37
Hamid 1 234 37
would 1 234 37
try 1 234 37
in 1 234 37
this 1 234 37
way 1 234 37
to 1 234 37
absolve 1 234 37
the 1 234 37
Muslim 1 234 37
community 1 234 37
of 1 234 37
any 1 234 37
responsibility 1 234 37
to 1 234 37
root 1 234 37
out 1 234 37
jihad 1 234 37
terrorist 1 234 37
from 1 234 37
its 1 234 37
midst. 1 234 37

There 0 234 38
is 0 234 38
certain 0 234 38
to 0 234 38
be 0 234 38
more 0 234 38
jihad 0 234 38
terrorism 0 234 38
during 0 234 38
this 0 234 38
Ramadan, 0 234 38
and 0 234 38
some 0 234 38
of 0 234 38
it 0 234 38
may 0 234 38
be 0 234 38
committed 0 234 38
by 0 234 38
Muslims 0 234 38
in 0 234 38
the 0 234 38
U.S. 0 234 38
Hamid, 1 234 38
if 1 234 38
he 1 234 38
cared 1 234 38
about 1 234 38
this, 1 234 38
would 1 234 38
be 1 234 38
confronting 1 234 38
honestly 1 234 38
the 1 234 38
teachings 1 234 38
of 1 234 38
Islam 1 234 38
that 1 234 38
make 1 234 38
Ramadan 1 234 38
the 1 234 38
month 1 234 38
of 1 234 38
jihad, 1 234 38
and 1 234 38
working 1 234 38
to 1 234 38
reform 1 234 38
them. 1 234 38

Meanwhile, 0 234 39
it 1 234 39
would 1 234 39
be 1 234 39
dangerous, 1 234 39
suicidal 1 234 39
folly 1 234 39
for 1 234 39
Infidels 1 234 39
to 1 234 39
pretend 1 234 39
that 1 234 39
Ramadan 1 234 39
is 1 234 39
not 1 234 39
the 1 234 39
month 1 234 39
of 1 234 39
jihad. 1 234 39

And 1 234 40
as 1 234 40
our 1 234 40
Ramadan 1 234 40
willful 1 234 40
blindness 1 234 40
continues, 1 234 40
more 1 234 40
Infidels 1 234 40
will 1 234 40
die. 1 234 40

it 0 73 5
paints 0 73 5

perhaps 0 73 11
most 0 73 11
telling 0 73 11
of 0 73 11

not 0 73 11

returning 0 73 12
to 0 73 12

still 1 73 12
less 1 73 12
of 0 73 12

the 0 73 12
Carmelites’ 0 73 12

Indeed, 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
one 0 73 13

in 0 73 13
Spain, 0 73 13
the 0 73 13

in 0 73 19
this 0 73 19
situation, 0 73 19
the 0 73 19
“solution” 0 73 19
undertaken 0 73 19
has 0 73 19
been 0 73 19

gaining 0 73 19
approval 0 73 19
from 0 73 19

whose 0 73 19
main 0 73 19
task, 0 73 19
no 0 73 19
doubt, 0 73 19
will 0 73 19
be 0 73 19
the 0 73 19

states 0 73 21
tersely 0 73 21
that 0 73 21
their 0 73 21
biggest 0 73 21
problem 0 73 21
is 0 73 21
“ageing” 0 73 21
but 0 73 21
under 0 73 21
“possible 0 73 21

only, 0 73 21
“We 0 73 21

It 0 73 22
is 0 73 22
only 0 73 22
in 0 73 22
the 0 73 22

where 0 73 22
the 0 73 22

changes 0 73 22
abruptly 0 73 22
from 0 73 22

It 0 73 23
is 0 73 23
also 0 73 23
notable 0 73 23
that 0 73 23
it 0 73 23
is 0 73 23
only 0 73 23
in 0 73 23
the 0 73 23

47, 0 73 24
and 0 73 24
eleven 0 73 24
in 0 73 24

This 0 73 25
outlier 0 73 25
differs 0 73 25
from 0 73 25
the 0 73 25
Western 0 73 25
European 0 73 25
federations 0 73 25
in 0 73 25
several 0 73 25
respects, 0 73 25
notably 0 73 25
that 0 73 25
it 0 73 25
was 0 73 25
only 0 73 25
federated 0 73 25
in 0 73 25
2002. 0 73 25

But 0 73 26
the 0 73 26
effects 0 73 26
of 0 73 26
the 0 73 26
federating/formation 0 73 26
courses 0 73 26
are 0 73 26
already 0 73 26
being 0 73 26
felt: 0 73 26
“Nowadays, 0 73 26
two 0 73 26

however 0 73 27
this 0 73 27
community 0 73 27
is 0 73 27
not 0 73 27
federated. 0 73 27

From 0 73 28
the 0 73 28
beginning, 0 73 28
our 0 73 28
Association 0 73 28
has 0 73 28

we 0 73 29
have 0 73 29
one 0 73 29

the 0 73 32

but 0 73 32
there 0 73 32
are 0 73 32
differences 0 73 32
between 0 73 32
the 0 73 32

is 0 73 90
not 0 73 90
easy 0 73 90
to 0 73 90

the 0 73 92
high 0 73 92
number 0 73 92

Possible 0 73 93
Solutions: 0 73 93
It 0 73 93
is 0 73 93
completely 0 73 93
necessary 0 73 93

what 0 73 93

essential, 0 73 93

The 0 73 94
challenge 0 73 94

grow 0 73 94
in 0 73 94
confidence 0 73 94
and 0 73 94

should 0 73 94
lead 0 73 94
us 0 73 94

untouchable 0 73 94
autonomy 0 73 94

to 0 73 94
a 0 73 94
daughter 0 73 94
of 0 73 94

Teresa, 0 73 94
the 0 73 94
really 0 73 94
important 0 73 94
thing 0 73 94
is 0 73 94
to 0 73 94

we 0 73 146
have 0 73 146
reached 0 73 146
the 0 73 146
moment 0 73 146
when 0 73 146
a 0 73 146
General 0 73 146
Assembly 0 73 146
is 0 73 146
no 0 73 146
longer 0 73 146
possible. 0 73 146

We 0 73 147
are 0 73 147
left 0 73 147
with 0 73 147
the 0 73 147
problem 0 73 147
that 0 73 147
in 0 73 147
the 0 73 147
communities 0 73 147
there 0 73 147
are 0 73 147
no 0 73 147
sisters 0 73 147
who 0 73 147
can 0 73 147
or 0 73 147
who 0 73 147
want 0 73 147
to 0 73 147
be 0 73 147
prioresses 0 73 147
or 0 73 147
council 0 73 147
sisters. 0 73 147

The 0 73 148
structure 0 73 148
of 0 73 148
the 0 73 148
Federation 0 73 148
that 0 73 148
we 0 73 148
have 0 73 148
had 0 73 148
till 0 73 148
now 0 73 148
is 0 73 148
thus 0 73 148
no 0 73 148
longer 0 73 148
possible. 0 73 148

Possible 0 73 149
solutions: 0 73 149
The 0 73 149
Federation 0 73 149
Council, 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
Religious 0 73 149
Assistant, 0 73 149
together 0 73 149
with 0 73 149
a 0 73 149
canon 0 73 149
lawyer 0 73 149
of 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
Dutch 0 73 149
Conference 0 73 149
of 0 73 149
Religious, 0 73 149
have 0 73 149
worked 0 73 149
hard 0 73 149
on 0 73 149
a 0 73 149
completely 0 73 149
new 0 73 149
structure, 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
which 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
its 0 73 149
first 0 73 149
draft 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
autonomy 0 73 149
of 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
Carmel 0 73 149
has 0 73 149
been 0 73 149
constantly 0 73 149
kept 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
mind. 0 73 149

We 0 73 150
began 0 73 150
from 0 73 150
three 0 73 150
points: 0 73 150

1)Maintenance 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
formal 0 73 151
autonomy 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
Carmels 0 73 151
that 0 73 151
still 0 73 151
exist, 0 73 151
but 0 73 151
with 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
chance 0 73 151
to 0 73 151
transfer 0 73 151
tasks 0 73 151
gradually 0 73 151
to 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
council 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
Federation. 0 73 151

2)Appointment 0 73 152
of 0 73 152
The 0 73 152
Federal 0 73 152
board 0 73 152
or 0 73 152
Federal 0 73 152
Council 0 73 152
of 0 73 152
the 0 73 152
Federation, 0 73 152
preferably 0 73 152
appointed 0 73 152
by 0 73 152
the 0 73 152
Superior 0 73 152
General. 0 73 152

The 0 73 153
team 0 73 153
will 0 73 153
consist 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
a 0 73 153
president 0 73 153
and 0 73 153
vice-president 0 73 153
who 0 73 153
are 0 73 153
members 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
one 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
the 0 73 153
convents, 0 73 153
appointed 0 73 153
to 0 73 153
functions, 0 73 153
and 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
three 0 73 153
people 0 73 153
who 0 73 153
are 0 73 153
members, 0 73 153
or 0 73 153
not, 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
one 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
the 0 73 153
convents. 0 73 153

3)A 0 73 154
Supervisory 0 73 154
council, 0 73 154
also 0 73 154
to 0 73 154
be 0 73 154
appointed 0 73 154
periodically 0 73 154
by 0 73 154
the 0 73 154
Superior 0 73 154
General, 0 73 154
which 0 73 154
will 0 73 154
be 0 73 154
made 0 73 154
up 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
three 0 73 154
members, 0 73 154
whose 0 73 154
president 0 73 154
will 0 73 154
be, 0 73 154
preferably, 0 73 154
a 0 73 154
member 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
a 0 73 154
religious 0 73 154
institute, 0 73 154
preferably 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
the 0 73 154
Carmelite 0 73 154
Order 0 73 154
and 0 73 154
appointed 0 73 154
to 0 73 154
functions. 0 73 154

This 0 73 155
council 0 73 155
sees 0 73 155
itself 0 73 155
as 0 73 155
a 0 73 155
supervisory 0 73 155
body 0 73 155
and 0 73 155
to 0 73 155
give 0 73 155
advice 0 73 155
that 0 73 155
will 0 73 155
more 0 73 155
or 0 73 155
less 0 73 155
replace 0 73 155
the 0 73 155
Assembly 0 73 155
of 0 73 155
the 0 73 155
Federation. 0 73 155

In 0 73 156
October 0 73 156
2008, 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
President, 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
Religious 0 73 156
Assistant 0 73 156
and 0 73 156
a 0 73 156
Lawyer 0 73 156
were 0 73 156
in 0 73 156
Rome 0 73 156
where 0 73 156
they 0 73 156
explained 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
proposals. 0 73 156

They 0 73 157
had 0 73 157
meetings 0 73 157
with 0 73 157
Fr. 0 73 157

General 0 73 158
and 0 73 158
with 0 73 158
the 0 73 158
Congregation 0 73 158
for 0 73 158
Religious. 0 73 158

These 0 73 159
were 0 73 159
open 0 73 159
meetings 0 73 159
that 0 73 159
helped 0 73 159
us 0 73 159
to 0 73 159
clarify 0 73 159
matters. 0 73 159

An 0 73 160
important 0 73 160
concern 0 73 160
was 0 73 160
that 0 73 160
they 0 73 160
would 0 73 160
allow 0 73 160
us 0 73 160
to 0 73 160
use 0 73 160
lay 0 73 160
people 0 73 160
on 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Federal 0 73 160
Council 0 73 160
of 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Federation 0 73 160
and 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Supervisory 0 73 160
council. 0 73 160

We 0 73 161
were 0 73 161
aware 0 73 161
that 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
were 0 73 161
not 0 73 161
dealing 0 73 161
with 0 73 161
a 0 73 161
simple 0 73 161
matter, 0 73 161
but 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
think 0 73 161
that, 0 73 161
in 0 73 161
view 0 73 161
of 0 73 161
our 0 73 161
present 0 73 161
situation 0 73 161
today, 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
do 0 73 161
not 0 73 161
have 0 73 161
much 0 73 161
choice. 0 73 161

It 0 73 162
is 0 73 162
important 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
continue 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
protect 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
interests 0 73 162
of 0 73 162
our 0 73 162
Federation 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
most 0 73 162
responsible 0 73 162
and 0 73 162
careful 0 73 162
way, 0 73 162
so 0 73 162
that 0 73 162
all 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
sisters, 0 73 162
even 0 73 162
those 0 73 162
advanced 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
years, 0 73 162
can 0 73 162
continue 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
live 0 73 162
their 0 73 162
life 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
Carmel. 0 73 162

Definitive 0 73 163
permission 0 73 163
came 0 73 163
at 0 73 163
the 0 73 163
25th 0 73 163
of 0 73 163
February. 0 73 163

~~~ 0 73 164

Given 0 73 165
this 0 73 165
incredible 1 73 165
picture 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
a 0 73 165
Carmelite 0 73 165
Order 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
last 0 73 165
rattle 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
its 0 73 165
death 1 73 165
throes, 1 73 165
the 0 73 165
rest 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
summaries 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
speeches 0 73 165
given 0 73 165
at 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
meeting 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
Avila 0 73 165
read 0 73 165
as 0 73 165
outright 0 73 165
surreal, 0 73 165
leaving 0 73 165
us 0 73 165
to 0 73 165
wonder 0 73 165
if 0 73 165
any 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
these 0 73 165
people 0 73 165
are 0 73 165
attached 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
any 0 73 165
way 0 73 165
to 0 73 165
reality. 0 73 165

Sr. 0 73 166
Enrica 0 73 166
Rosanna, 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
representative 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
Vatican’s 0 73 166
Congregation 0 73 166
for 0 73 166
Religious 0 73 166
told 0 73 166
them 0 73 166
that 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
“two 0 73 166
great 0 73 166
challenges 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
our 0 73 166
contemplative 0 73 166
life” 0 73 166
are 0 73 166
“the 0 73 166
challenge 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
globalization 0 73 166
and 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
challenge 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
irrelevancy.” 0 73 166
She 0 73 166
warned 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
nuns 0 73 166
against 0 73 166
bringing 0 73 166
vocations 0 73 166
from 0 73 166
other 0 73 166
countries 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
keep 0 73 166
their 0 73 166
monasteries 0 73 166
alive, 0 73 166
dropping 0 73 166
a 0 73 166
hint 0 73 166
about 0 73 166
what 0 73 166
now 0 73 166
seems 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
be 0 73 166
a 0 73 166
particular 0 73 166
obsession 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
Congregation. 0 73 166

Cor 0 73 167
orans 0 73 167
would 0 73 167
take 0 73 167
this 0 73 167
subject 0 73 167
up 0 73 167
definitively 0 73 167
in 0 73 167
2018: 0 73 167

The 0 73 168
nuns 0 73 168
were 0 73 168
exhorted 0 73 168
to 0 73 168
“stay 0 73 168
awake 0 73 168
to 0 73 168
welcome 0 73 168
the 0 73 168
dawn” 0 73 168
of 0 73 168
a 0 73 168
bright 0 73 168
new 0 73 168
future: 0 73 168

“These 0 73 169
are 0 73 169
difficult 0 73 169
and 0 73 169
uncertain 0 73 169
times, 0 73 169
but 0 73 169
it 0 73 169
is 0 73 169
also 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
time 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
stay 0 73 169
awake 0 73 169
as 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
new 0 73 169
dawn 0 73 169
is 0 73 169
already 0 73 169
announcing 0 73 169
itself.” 0 73 169
“Our 0 73 169
aim 0 73 169
must 0 73 169
be 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
be 0 73 169
open 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
future. 0 73 169

We 0 73 170
should 0 73 170
not 0 73 170
forget 0 73 170
that 0 73 170
we 0 73 170
are 0 73 170
following 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
the 0 73 170
tradition 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
Teresa 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
Jesus 0 73 170
and 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
the 0 73 170
tradition 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
all 0 73 170
those 0 73 170
who 0 73 170
have 0 73 170
followed 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
her 0 73 170
footsteps. 0 73 170

It 0 73 171
is 0 73 171
a 0 73 171
wide 0 73 171
road 0 73 171
that 0 73 171
opens 0 73 171
up 0 73 171
before 0 73 171
us. 0 73 171

We 0 73 172
must 0 73 172
be 0 73 172
women 0 73 172
of 0 73 172
hope 0 73 172
and 0 73 172
faith. 0 73 172

We 0 73 173
must 0 73 173
always 0 73 173
believe 0 73 173
that 0 73 173
God 0 73 173
is 0 73 173
the 0 73 173
one 0 73 173
who 0 73 173
directs 0 73 173
history. 0 73 173

From 0 73 174
this 0 73 174
derives 0 73 174
our 0 73 174
task, 0 73 174
to 0 73 174
be 0 73 174
creative 0 73 174
and, 0 73 174
at 0 73 174
the 0 73 174
same 0 73 174
time, 0 73 174
faithful 0 73 174
(creative 0 73 174
fidelity).” 0 73 174
[emphasis 0 73 174
in 0 73 174
the 0 73 174
original.] 0 73 174

While 0 73 175
there 0 73 175
can 0 73 175
be 0 73 175
no 0 73 175
doubt 0 73 175
that 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
impending 1 73 175
total 1 73 175
extinction 1 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
Carmelite 0 73 175
Order 0 73 175
in 0 73 175
Western 0 73 175
Europe 0 73 175
was 0 73 175
foremost 0 73 175
in 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
minds 0 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
nuns 0 73 175
present, 0 73 175
it 0 73 175
seems 0 73 175
that 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
issue 0 73 175
was 0 73 175
simply 0 73 175
not 0 73 175
addressed 0 73 175
out 0 73 175
loud 0 73 175

Instead, 0 73 176
Sr. 0 73 176
Enrica, 0 73 176
after 0 73 176
this 0 73 176
bizarre 0 73 176
and 0 73 176
cryptic 0 73 176
comment, 0 73 176
spoke 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
the 0 73 176

in 0 73 176
discernment 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
mostly 0 73 176
non-existent 0 73 176

including 0 73 176
“consumerism, 0 73 176

autonomy 0 73 176
of 0 73 176

What 1 73 177
are 1 73 177
these 1 73 177
people 1 73 177
smoking? 1 73 177

Given 0 73 178
that 0 73 178
this 0 73 178
was 0 73 178
three 0 73 178
years 0 73 178
or 0 73 178
more 0 73 178
from 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
abdication 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
Benedict 0 73 178
and 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
installation 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
New 0 73 178
Paradigm 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
Francis/Kasper, 0 73 178
one 0 73 178
wonders 0 73 178
what 0 73 178
this 0 73 178
“new 0 73 178
dawn” 0 73 178
was 0 73 178
actually 0 73 178
about. 0 73 178

Perhaps 0 73 179
a 0 73 179
useful 0 73 179
question 0 73 179
for 0 73 179
one 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
nuns 0 73 179
present 0 73 179
could 0 73 179
have 0 73 179
been, 0 73 179
“A 0 73 179
‘new 1 73 179
dawn’ 1 73 179
of 0 73 179
what, 0 73 179
exactly?” 0 73 179
This 0 73 179
kind 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
coded 0 73 179
language 0 73 179
has 0 73 179
been 0 73 179
popular 0 73 179
with 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
progressivist 0 73 179
faction 0 73 179
in 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
Church 0 73 179
since 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
1960s, 0 73 179
when 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
expectation 0 73 179
was 0 73 179
for 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
installation 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
a 0 73 179
totally 0 73 179
new 0 73 179
Church. 0 73 179

Was 0 73 180
Sr. 0 73 180
Enrica 0 73 180
somehow 0 73 180
anticipating 0 73 180
the 0 73 180
fulfillment 0 73 180
of 0 73 180
those 0 73 180
hippie-era 0 73 180
dreams 0 73 180
in 0 73 180
the 0 73 180
years 0 73 180
to 0 73 180
come? 0 73 180

It 0 73 181
is 0 73 181
certainly 0 73 181
clear 0 73 181
from 0 73 181
Francis’ 0 73 181
first 0 73 181
acts 0 73 181
as 0 73 181
pope 0 73 181
that 0 73 181
he 0 73 181
had 0 73 181
dealing 0 73 181
with 0 73 181
conservative 0 73 181
and 0 73 181
Traditionalist 0 73 181

on 0 73 181
his 0 73 181
list 0 73 181
of 0 73 181
priorities. 0 73 181

His 0 73 182
first 0 73 182
appointment, 0 73 182
no 0 73 182
more 0 73 182
than 0 73 182
three 0 73 182
weeks 0 73 182
after 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Conclave 0 73 182
was 0 73 182
Jose 0 73 182

the 0 73 182
Religious 0 73 182
Congregation’s 0 73 182
Secretary 0 73 182
and 0 73 182
– 0 73 182
given 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
scandal 0 73 182
that 0 73 182
erupted 0 73 182
on 0 73 182
his 0 73 182
leaving 0 73 182
them 0 73 182
– 0 73 182
the 0 73 182

of 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Franciscan 0 73 182

Minor. 0 73 182

The 0 73 183
first 0 73 183
task 0 73 183
Francis 0 73 183
gave 0 73 183
Carballo 0 73 183
was 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
demolition 1 73 183
of 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
Franciscan 0 73 183
Friars 0 73 183
of 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
Immaculate. 0 73 183

Certainly 0 73 184
this 0 73 184
record 0 73 184
of 0 73 184
the 0 73 184
European 0 73 184
Carmelites’ 0 73 184
meeting 0 73 184
is 0 73 184
jammed 0 73 184
with 0 73 184
hints 0 73 184
that 0 73 184
Cor 0 73 184
orans 0 73 184
was 0 73 184
on 0 73 184
the 0 73 184
way. 0 73 184

On 0 73 185
the 0 73 185
final 0 73 185
day 0 73 185
of 0 73 185
the 0 73 185
meeting, 0 73 185
the 0 73 185
“theme 0 73 185
for 0 73 185

was 0 73 185
offered 0 73 185
by 0 73 185
then-Father 0 73 185
General 0 73 185
Luis 0 73 185
Arostegui: 0 73 185
“Government: 0 73 185

The 0 73 188
devolution 0 73 188

to 0 73 188

was 0 73 188
obviously 0 73 188
on 0 73 188
someone’s 0 73 188
mind, 0 73 188
as 0 73 188
was 0 73 188
a 0 73 188
plan 0 73 188
to 0 73 188
see 0 73 188
to 0 73 188
it 0 73 188
that 0 73 188
monasteries 0 73 188
change 0 73 188
superiors 0 73 188
frequently: 0 73 188
“Essential 0 73 188

the 0 73 188
Father 0 73 188
General 0 73 188
warned. 0 73 188

And 0 73 189
there 0 73 189
were 0 73 189
certainly 0 73 189
hints 0 73 189
that 0 73 189
a 0 73 189

re-organisation 0 73 189
of 0 73 189

rather 0 73 190
than 0 73 190
make 0 73 190
suggestions, 0 73 190
and 0 73 190
Arostegui 0 73 190
asked 0 73 190
some 0 73 190
very 0 73 190
leading 0 73 190
questions 0 73 190
indeed 0 73 190

Maybe 0 73 206
this 0 73 206
summary 0 73 206
document 0 73 206
of 0 73 206
2009 0 73 206
can 0 73 206
give 0 73 206
us 0 73 206
an 0 73 206
idea 0 73 206
what 0 73 206
to 0 73 206
expect 0 73 206
from 0 73 206
Rome 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
2018, 0 73 206
now 0 73 206
that 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
“progressivist” 0 73 206
faction 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
Vatican 0 73 206
is 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
ascendancy 0 73 206
and 0 73 206
is 0 73 206
free 0 73 206
to 0 73 206
act 0 73 206
without 0 73 206
restriction. 0 73 206

What 0 73 207
comes 0 73 207
clear 0 73 207
comparing 0 73 207
this 0 73 207
document 0 73 207
to 0 73 207
Cor 0 73 207
orans 0 73 207
is 0 73 207
that 0 73 207
the 0 73 207
Vatican’s 0 73 207
machinery 0 73 207
has 0 73 207
long 0 73 207
been 0 73 207
at 0 73 207
work 0 73 207
forcing 0 73 207
a 0 73 207
uniform 0 73 207
and 0 73 207
essentially 0 73 207
bureaucratic, 0 73 207
heavily 0 73 207
authoritarian 0 73 207
and 0 73 207
legalistic 0 73 207
vision 0 73 207
of 0 73 207
contemplative 0 73 207
life 0 73 207
on 0 73 207
anyone 0 73 207
who 0 73 207
fails 0 73 207
sufficiently 0 73 207
to 0 73 207
resist 0 73 207
it. 0 73 207

And 0 73 208
with 0 73 208
the 0 73 208
statistics 0 73 208
offered 0 73 208
at 0 73 208
this 0 73 208
meeting 0 73 208
we 0 73 208
can 0 73 208
see 0 73 208
clearly 0 73 208
where 0 73 208
this 0 73 208
road 0 73 208
leads. 0 73 208

So 0 73 209
many 0 73 209
Catholics 0 73 209
in 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
last 0 73 209
40 0 73 209
years 0 73 209
assumed 0 73 209
that 0 73 209
under 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
“conservatives” 0 73 209
John 0 73 209
Paul 0 73 209
II 0 73 209
and 0 73 209
Benedict 0 73 209
XVI 0 73 209
at 0 73 209
least 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
Vatican 0 73 209
was 0 73 209
“onside.” 0 73 209
At 0 73 209
least 0 73 209
in 0 73 209
Rome 0 73 209
they 0 73 209
understood 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
terrible 1 73 209
threat 0 73 209
of 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
Bolshie 0 73 209
VaticanTwoist 0 73 209
revolutionaries. 0 73 209

But 0 73 210
this 0 73 210
report 0 73 210
of 0 73 210
2009 0 73 210
shows 0 73 210
a 0 73 210
clear 0 73 210
picture 0 73 210
of 0 73 210
a 0 73 210
Roman 0 73 210
congregation 0 73 210
determined 0 73 210
to 0 73 210
see 0 73 210
the 0 73 210
revolution 0 73 210
through 0 73 210
to 0 73 210
its 0 73 210
inevitable 0 73 210
conclusion. 0 73 210

“We’ll 0 237 10

after 0 237 12

Saucier, 0 237 14
who 0 237 14
lives 0 237 14
in 0 237 14
Vermont, 0 237 14
pleaded 0 237 14
guilty 0 237 14

Connecticut, 0 237 14
in 0 237 14
2009. 0 237 14

He 0 237 15
said 0 237 15
he 0 237 15
only 0 237 15
wanted 0 237 15
service 0 237 15
mementos, 0 237 15
but 0 237 15
federal 0 237 15
prosecutors 0 237 15
argued 0 237 15
he 0 237 15
was 0 237 15
a 0 237 15
disgruntled 0 237 15
sailor 0 237 15
who 0 237 15

Saucier 0 237 16
said 0 237 16
that 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
recognized 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
had 0 237 16
erred 0 237 16
in 0 237 16
taking 0 237 16
the 0 237 16
photos, 0 237 16
which 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
said 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
wanted 0 237 16

them 0 237 16
where 0 237 16
he 0 237 16
worked. 0 237 16

But 0 237 17
he 0 237 17
lashed 0 237 17
out 0 237 17
at 0 237 17
Obama 0 237 17
officials, 0 237 17
saying 0 237 17
that 0 237 17
his 0 237 17
prosecution 0 237 17
was 0 237 17
politically 0 237 17
motivated, 0 237 17
prompted 0 237 17
by 0 237 17
sensitivity 0 237 17
about 0 237 17
classified 0 237 17
information 0 237 17
amid 0 237 17
the 0 237 17
scandal 0 237 17
involving 0 237 17
Clinton's 0 237 17
emails. 0 237 17

“My 0 237 18
case 0 237 18
was 0 237 18
usually 0 237 18
something 0 237 18
handled 0 237 18
by 0 237 18
military 0 237 18
courts,” 0 237 18
he 0 237 18
said. 0 237 18

“They 1 237 19
used 1 237 19
me 1 237 19
as 1 237 19
an 1 237 19

because 1 237 19
of 1 237 19
[the 1 237 19

over] 1 237 19
Hillary 1 237 19
Clinton.” 1 237 19

Saucier, 0 237 20
31, 0 237 20
said 0 237 20
that 0 237 20
the 0 237 20
pardon 0 237 20
has 0 237 20
enabled 0 237 20
him 0 237 20
to 0 237 20
pick 0 237 20
up 0 237 20
the 0 237 20
pieces 0 237 20
and 0 237 20
rebuild 0 237 20

with 0 237 20
his 0 237 20
wife 0 237 20
and 0 237 20
young 0 237 20
daughter. 0 237 20

A 0 237 21
felony 0 237 21
conviction 0 237 21
left 0 237 21
him 0 237 21
scrambling 0 237 21
to 0 237 21
find 0 237 21
work; 0 237 21
he 0 237 21
finally 0 237 21
landed 0 237 21
a 0 237 21
job 0 237 21
collecting 0 237 21
garbage. 0 237 21

Now, 0 237 22
he 0 237 22
works 0 237 22
on 0 237 22
design 0 237 22
and 0 237 22
engineering 0 237 22
projects 0 237 22
for 0 237 22

“Things 0 237 23
are 0 237 23
starting 0 237 23
to 0 237 23
go 0 237 23
in 0 237 23
the 0 237 23
right 0 237 23
direction,” 0 237 23
Saucier 0 237 23
said. 0 237 23

“I 0 237 24
work 0 237 24
with 0 237 24
a 0 237 24

of 0 237 24
really 0 237 24
great 0 237 24
people, 0 237 24
I 0 237 24
get 0 237 24
to 0 237 24
use 0 237 24
my 0 237 24

Because 0 237 25
of 0 237 25
the 0 237 25
loss 0 237 25
of 0 237 25
income 0 237 25
during 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
imprisonment, 0 237 25
as 0 237 25
well 0 237 25
as 0 237 25
earning 0 237 25
below 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
potential 0 237 25
when 0 237 25
he 0 237 25
collected 0 237 25

he 0 237 25
and 0 237 25
his 0 237 25
wife 0 237 25
Sadie 0 237 25
lost 0 237 25
their 0 237 25

Debt 0 237 26
collectors 0 237 26
called 0 237 26
and 0 237 26
his 0 237 26
cars 0 237 26
were 0 237 26
repossessed. 0 237 26

“With 0 237 27
a 0 237 27
pardon 0 237 27
there’s 0 237 27
no 0 237 27
magic 0 237 27

that 0 237 27
that 0 237 27
gets 0 237 27

makes 0 237 27
everything 0 237 27
right,” 0 237 27

He 0 237 28
praises 0 237 28
the 0 237 28
pardons 0 237 28
that 0 237 28
Trump 0 237 28
has 0 237 28
granted, 0 237 28
and 0 237 28
takes 0 237 28
exception 0 237 28
at 0 237 28
the 0 237 28
criticism. 0 237 28

“The 0 237 29
Obama 0 237 29

singled 0 237 29
out 0 237 29

“President 0 237 30

Speaking 0 238 3
to 0 238 3

Clinton 0 238 3
defended 0 238 3

decision 0 238 3
to 0 238 3

“A 0 238 4

the 0 238 4
story 0 238 4

I 0 238 4
think 0 238 4
partly 0 238 4
because 0 238 4
they’re 0 238 4
frustrated 0 238 4
that 0 238 4
they 0 238 4

questioning 0 238 7
the 0 238 7
narrative 0 238 7
surrounding 0 238 7
the 0 238 7

which 0 238 7
played 0 238 7
a 0 238 7
central 0 238 7
role 0 238 7
in 0 238 7

impeachment. 0 238 7

“Now, 0 238 8
at 0 238 8

I’m 0 238 8
beginning 0 238 8
(just 0 238 8
beginning) 0 238 8
to 0 238 8
consider 0 238 8
the 0 238 8
implications 0 238 8
of 0 238 8
power 0 238 8
differentials 0 238 8
that 0 238 8
were 0 238 8
so 0 238 8
vast 0 238 8
between 0 238 8
a 0 238 8

and 0 238 8
a 0 238 8

“I’m 0 238 9

that 0 238 9
in 0 238 9
such 0 238 9

the 0 238 9

When 0 238 10
asked 0 238 10
if 0 238 10
he 0 238 10
owed 0 238 10

an 0 238 10
apology, 0 238 10

I 0 238 11
did 0 238 11
say 0 238 11
publicly 0 238 11
on 0 238 11
more 0 238 11
than 0 238 11
one 0 238 11
occasion 0 238 11
that 0 238 11
I 0 238 11
was 0 238 11
sorry. 0 238 11

That’s 0 238 12
very 0 238 12
different. 0 238 12

The 0 238 13
apology 0 238 13
was 0 238 13
public.” 0 238 13
Although 0 238 13
some 0 238 13

not 0 238 13
have 0 238 13
taken 0 238 13
what 0 238 13

as 0 238 13
an 0 238 13
apology, 0 238 13

out 0 240 9
to 0 240 9
create 0 240 9

A 0 240 14
brief 0 240 14
history: 0 240 14
In 0 240 14
seven 0 240 14
elections 0 240 14
starting 0 240 14
in 0 240 14
1992, 0 240 14
Republicans 0 240 14
won 0 240 14
the 0 240 14
presidency 0 240 14
three 0 240 14
times, 0 240 14
but 0 240 14
the 0 240 14
popular 0 240 14
vote 0 240 14
only 0 240 14
once, 0 240 14
in 0 240 14
2004, 0 240 14
when 0 240 14
George 0 240 14

Iraq. 0 240 14

What 0 240 15
fractured 0 240 15
and 0 240 15
overwhelmed 0 240 15
the 0 240 15
Bush-Boehner 0 240 15
Republican 0 240 15
Party? 0 240 15

First, 0 240 16
demography. 0 240 16

the 0 240 17
1965 0 240 17

Nixon-Reagan 0 240 17

Second, 0 240 18
the 0 240 18
collapse 0 240 18
of 0 240 18
the 0 240 18
Soviet 1 240 18

War. 0 240 18

After 0 240 19
the 0 240 19
Red 0 240 19

a 0 240 19
new 0 240 19

Third, 0 240 20
faithful 0 240 20
to 0 240 20
the 0 240 20
free 0 240 20

which 0 240 20

MFN 0 240 20

Historians 0 240 21
will 0 240 21
look 0 240 21
back 0 240 21
in 0 240 21
amazement 0 240 21
at 0 240 21
how 0 240 21
America's 0 240 21
free 0 240 21
trade 0 240 21
zealots 1 240 21
gave 0 240 21
away 0 240 21
the 0 240 21
greatest 0 240 21
manufacturing 0 240 21
base 0 240 21
the 0 240 21
world 0 240 21
had 0 240 21
ever 0 240 21
seen, 0 240 21
as 0 240 21
they 0 240 21
quoted 0 240 21
approvingly 0 240 21
18th- 0 240 21
and 0 240 21
19th-century 0 240 21
scribblers 0 240 21
whose 0 240 21
ideas 0 240 21
had 0 240 21
done 0 240 21
so 0 240 21
much 0 240 21
to 0 240 21
bring 0 240 21
down 0 240 21
their 1 240 21
own 1 240 21
country, 1 240 21
Great 1 240 21
Britain. 1 240 21

Between 0 240 22
1997 0 240 22
and 0 240 22
2017, 0 240 22
the 0 240 22
EU 0 240 22
ran 0 240 22

at 0 240 22
America's 0 240 22

trade 0 240 22
surpluses 0 240 22
in 0 240 22
goods 0 240 22
in 0 240 22
excess 0 240 22
of 0 240 22
$2 0 240 22
trillion, 0 240 22
while 0 240 22
we 0 240 22
also 0 240 22
picked 0 240 22
up 0 240 22
the 0 240 22

Europe's 0 240 22

Between 0 240 23
1992 0 240 23
and 0 240 23
2016, 0 240 23
China 1 240 23

allowed 1 240 23
to 1 240 23

$4 1 240 23

and 1 240 23
millions 1 240 23
of 1 240 23

In 0 240 24
Trump's 0 240 24
first 0 240 24
year, 0 240 24
China's 0 240 24
trade 0 240 24
surplus 0 240 24
with 0 240 24
the 0 240 24
United 0 240 24
States 0 240 24
hit 0 240 24
$375 0 240 24
billion. 0 240 24

From 0 240 25
January 0 240 25
to 0 240 25
March 0 240 25
of 0 240 25
this 0 240 25
year, 0 240 25
our 0 240 25
trade 0 240 25
deficit 0 240 25
with 0 240 25
China 0 240 25
was 0 240 25
running 0 240 25
at 0 240 25
close 0 240 25
to 0 240 25
the 0 240 25
same 0 240 25
astronomical 0 240 25
rate. 0 240 25

"Trade 0 240 26
deficits 0 240 26
do 0 240 26
not 0 240 26
matter," 0 240 26
we 0 240 26
hear 0 240 26
from 0 240 26
the 0 240 26
economists. 0 240 26

They 0 240 27
might 0 240 27
explain 0 240 27
that 0 240 27
to 0 240 27
Ohio, 0 240 27
Michigan 0 240 27
and 0 240 27
Pennsylvania. 0 240 27

And 0 240 28
perhaps 0 240 28
someone 0 240 28
can 0 240 28
explain 0 240 28
the 0 240 28
wisdom 0 240 28
of 0 240 28
handing 0 240 28
4 0 240 28
percent 0 240 28
of 0 240 28
our 0 240 28
GDP 0 240 28
each 0 240 28
year 0 240 28
to 0 240 28
an 0 240 28
adversary 0 240 28
nation, 0 240 28
as 0 240 28
U.S. 0 240 28
admirals 0 240 28
talk 0 240 28
tough 0 240 28
about 0 240 28
confronting 0 240 28
that 0 240 28
adversary 0 240 28
nation 0 240 28
over 0 240 28
islets 0 240 28
and 0 240 28

in 0 240 28
the 0 240 28
South 0 240 28

Why 0 240 29
are 0 240 29
we 0 240 29
enriching 0 240 29
and 0 240 29
empowering 0 240 29
so 0 240 29
exorbitantly 0 240 29
those 0 240 29
whom 0 240 29
we 0 240 29
are 0 240 29
told 0 240 29
we 0 240 29
may 0 240 29
have 0 240 29
to 0 240 29
fight? 0 240 29

Fourth, 0 240 30
under 0 240 30
Bush 0 240 30
II 0 240 30
and 0 240 30
Obama, 0 240 30
the 0 240 30
U.S. 0 240 30
intervened 0 240 30
massively 0 240 30
in 0 240 30
the 0 240 30
Near 0 240 30
and 0 240 30
Middle 0 240 30
East—in 0 240 30
Afghanistan, 0 240 30
Iraq, 0 240 30
Libya, 0 240 30
Syria, 0 240 30
Yemen. 0 240 30

And 0 240 31
the 0 240 31
forces 0 240 31
that 0 240 31
pushed 0 240 31
up 0 240 31
into 0 240 31
those 0 240 31
conflicts, 0 240 31
and 0 240 31
so 1 240 31
disillusioned 1 240 31
the 1 240 31
nation 1 240 31
that 1 240 31
it 1 240 31
elected 1 240 31
Barack 1 240 31
Obama, 1 240 31
are 0 240 31
back, 0 240 31
pushing 0 240 31
for 0 240 31
a 0 240 31
new 0 240 31
war, 0 240 31
on 0 240 31
Iran. 0 240 31

They 0 240 32
may 0 240 32
get 0 240 32
this 0 240 32
war, 0 240 32
too. 0 240 32

Yet, 0 240 33
given 0 240 33
the 0 240 33
anti-interventionist 0 240 33
and 0 240 33
anti-war 0 240 33
stance 0 240 33
of 0 240 33
Trump's 0 240 33
winning 0 240 33
campaign, 0 240 33
and 0 240 33
of 0 240 33
the 0 240 33
Bernie 0 240 33
Sanders 0 240 33
campaign, 0 240 33
U.S. 0 240 33
involvement 0 240 33
in 0 240 33
Middle 0 240 33
East 0 240 33
wars 0 240 33
seems 0 240 33
less 0 240 33
America's 0 240 33
future 0 240 33
than 0 240 33
it 0 240 33
does 0 240 33
her 0 240 33
past. 0 240 33

After 0 240 34
his 0 240 34
16 0 240 34
months 0 240 34
in 0 240 34
office, 0 240 34
it 0 240 34
appears 0 240 34
as 0 240 34
though 0 240 34
the 0 240 34
Trump 0 240 34
presidency, 0 240 34
no 0 240 34
matter 0 240 34
how 0 240 34
brief, 0 240 34
is 0 240 34
going 0 240 34
to 0 240 34
be 0 240 34
a 0 240 34
watershed 1 240 34
moment 1 240 34
in 1 240 34
U.S. 1 240 34
and 1 240 34
world 1 240 34
history, 1 240 34
and 1 240 34
in 1 240 34
the 1 240 34
future 1 240 34
of 1 240 34
the 1 240 34
GOP. 1 240 34

The 0 240 35
world 0 240 35
is 0 240 35
changing. 0 240 35

NATO 0 240 36
and 0 240 36
the 0 240 36
EU 0 240 36
are 0 240 36
showing 0 240 36
their 0 240 36
age. 0 240 36

Nationalism, 0 240 37
populism 0 240 37
and 0 240 37
tribalism 0 240 37
are 0 240 37
pervasive 0 240 37
on 0 240 37
the 0 240 37
Old 0 240 37
Continent. 0 240 37

And 0 240 38
America's 0 240 38
willingness 0 240 38
to 0 240 38
bear 0 240 38
the 0 240 38
burden 0 240 38
of 0 240 38
Europe's 0 240 38
defense, 0 240 38
as 0 240 38
they 0 240 38
ride 0 240 38
virtually 0 240 38
free, 0 240 38
is 0 240 38
visibly 0 240 38
waning. 0 240 38

It 0 240 39
is 0 240 39
hard 0 240 39
to 0 240 39
see 0 240 39
why 0 240 39
or 0 240 39
how 0 240 39
Republicans 0 240 39
are 0 240 39
ever 0 240 39
again 0 240 39
going 0 240 39
to 0 240 39
be 0 240 39
the 0 240 39
Bush-Boehner 0 240 39
party 0 240 39
that 0 240 39
preceded 0 240 39
the 0 240 39
rise 0 240 39
of 0 240 39
Trump. 0 240 39

What 0 240 40
would 0 240 40
be 0 240 40
the 0 240 40
argument 0 240 40
for 0 240 40
returning 0 240 40
to 0 240 40
a 0 240 40
repudiated 1 240 40
platform? 0 240 40

Trump 0 240 41
not 0 240 41
only 0 240 41
defeated 0 240 41
16 0 240 41
Bush 0 240 41

Putin 0 240 41
and 0 240 41
Russia 0 240 41
that 0 240 41
was 0 240 41
a 0 240 41
rejection 0 240 41
of 0 240 41
what 0 240 41
the 0 240 41
Bush-Boehner 0 240 41
Party 0 240 41
had 0 240 41
stood 0 240 41
for 0 240 41
and 0 240 41
what 0 240 41
its 0 240 41
presidential 0 240 41
candidates 0 240 41
in 0 240 41
2008 0 240 41

John 0 240 41

Mitt 0 240 41
Romney, 0 240 41
had 0 240 41
run 0 240 41
on. 0 240 41

If 0 240 42
the 0 240 42
Republican 0 240 42
Party 0 240 42
is 0 240 42
"napping," 0 240 42
let 0 240 42
it 0 240 42
slumber 0 240 42
on, 0 240 42
undisturbed, 0 240 42

the 0 241 4
GOP 0 241 4

while 1 241 8
he 1 241 8
retires 1 241 8
to 1 241 8
Tennessee. 1 241 8

It's 0 241 9
no 0 241 9
wonder 0 241 9
the 0 241 9
establishment 0 241 9
is 0 241 9
viewed 0 241 9
with 0 241 9
such 0 241 9
derision. 1 241 9

Flake 0 241 10
calls 0 241 10
Trump 0 241 10
"dangerous 1 241 10
to 1 241 10
our 1 241 10
democracy." 1 241 10

But 0 241 11
the 0 241 11
real 0 241 11
threat 0 241 11
Trump 0 241 11
represents 0 241 11
is 0 241 11
to 0 241 11
the 0 241 11
GOP 0 241 11
establishment's 0 241 11
control 0 241 11
of 0 241 11
the 0 241 11
party's 0 241 11
agenda 0 241 11
and 0 241 11
the 0 241 11
party's 0 241 11
destiny. 0 241 11

U.S. 0 241 12
politics 0 241 12
have 0 241 12
indeed 0 241 12
been 0 241 12
coarsened, 0 241 12
with 0 241 12
Trump 0 241 12
playing 0 241 12
a 0 241 12
lead 0 241 12
role. 0 241 12

Yet, 0 241 13
beneath 0 241 13
the 0 241 13
savagery 1 241 13
of 0 241 13
the 0 241 13
uncivil 0 241 13
war 0 241 13
in 0 241 13
the 0 241 13
party 0 241 13
lies 0 241 13
more 0 241 13
than 0 241 13
personal 0 241 13
insults 0 241 13
and 0 241 13
personality 0 241 13
clashes. 0 241 13

This 0 241 14
is 0 241 14
a 0 241 14
struggle 0 241 14
about 0 241 14
policy, 0 241 14
about 1 241 14
the 1 241 14
future. 1 241 14

And 0 241 15
Trump 1 241 15
is 1 241 15
president 1 241 15
because 1 241 15
he 1 241 15
read 1 241 15
the 1 241 15
party 1 241 15
and 1 241 15
the 1 241 15
country 1 241 15
right, 1 241 15
while 0 241 15
the 0 241 15
Bush-McCain 0 241 15
Republican 0 241 15
establishment 0 241 15
had 0 241 15
lost 0 241 15
touch 0 241 15

both. 0 241 15

How 1 241 16
could 1 241 16
the 1 241 16
Beltway 1 241 16

not 1 241 16

Yesterday's 0 241 33

Times 0 241 33
recognized 0 241 33
Trump's 0 241 33
triumph: 1 241 33

"Despite 0 241 34
the 0 241 34
fervor 0 241 34
of 0 241 34
President 0 241 34
Trump's 0 241 34
Republican 0 241 34
opponents, 0 241 34
the 0 241 34
president's 0 241 34
brand 0 241 34
of 0 241 34
hard-edged 1 241 34
nationalism—with 0 241 34

root 0 241 34
within 0 241 34
his 0 241 34
adopted 0 241 34
party." 0 241 34

Moreover, 0 241 35
a 0 241 35
new 0 241 35
question 0 241 35
arises: 0 241 35

Can 0 241 36
the 0 241 36
GOP 0 241 36
establishment 0 241 36
believe 0 241 36
that 0 241 36
if 0 241 36
Trump 0 241 36
falls, 0 241 36
or 0 241 36
they 0 241 36
bring 0 241 36
him 0 241 36
down, 0 241 36
they 0 241 36
will 0 241 36
inherit 0 241 36
the 0 241 36
estate 0 241 36
and 0 241 36
be 0 241 36
welcomed 0 241 36
home 0 241 36
like 0 241 36
the 0 241 36
Prodigal 1 241 36
Son? 1 241 36

Do 1 241 37
they 1 241 37
believe 1 241 37
their 1 241 37
old 1 241 37
agenda 1 241 37
of 1 241 37
open 1 241 37
borders, 1 241 37
amnesty, 1 241 37
free 1 241 37
trade 1 241 37
globalism 1 241 37
and 1 241 37
democracy-crusading 1 241 37
can 1 241 37
become 1 241 37
America's 1 241 37
agenda 1 241 37
again? 1 241 37

Trumpism 1 241 38
is 0 241 38
not 0 241 38
a 0 241 38
detour, 0 241 38
after 0 241 38
which 0 241 38
we 0 241 38
can 0 241 38
all 0 241 38
get 0 241 38
back 0 241 38
on 0 241 38
the 0 241 38
interstate 0 241 38
to 0 241 38
the 0 241 38
New 0 241 38
World 0 241 38
Order. 0 241 38

For 0 241 39
though 0 241 39
unpleasant, 0 241 39
it 0 241 39
is 0 241 39
not 0 241 39
unfair 0 241 39
to 0 241 39
say 0 241 39
that 0 241 39
if 0 241 39
there 0 241 39
was 0 241 39
one 0 241 39
desire 0 241 39
common 0 241 39
to 0 241 39
Bernie 0 241 39
Sanders, 0 241 39
Ted 0 241 39
Cruz 0 241 39
and 0 241 39
Donald 0 241 39
Trump 0 241 39
voters, 0 241 39
it 0 241 39
was 0 241 39
be 0 241 39
rid 0 241 39
of 0 241 39
the 0 241 39
regime 0 241 39
resting 0 241 39
on 0 241 39
top 0 241 39
of 0 241 39
all 0 241 39
of 0 241 39
us. 0 241 39

Should 1 241 40
Trump 1 241 40
fall, 1 241 40
and 1 241 40
a 1 241 40
restored 1 241 40
establishment 1 241 40
attempt 1 241 40
to 1 241 40
reimpose 1 241 40
the 1 241 40
old 1 241 40
policies, 1 241 40
there 1 241 40
will 1 241 40
be 1 241 40
a 1 241 40
truly 1 241 40
uncivil 1 241 40
war 1 241 40
in 1 241 40
this 1 241 40
country. 1 241 40

After 1 241 41
the 1 241 41
Trumpian 1 241 41
revolt, 1 241 41
there 1 241 41
is 1 241 41
no 1 241 41
going 1 241 41
back. 1 241 41

As 0 241 42
that 0 241 42
most 1 241 42
American 1 241 42
of 1 241 42
writers, 1 241 42
Thomas 0 241 42
Wolfe, 0 241 42
put 0 241 42
it, 0 241 42
"You 0 241 42
can't 0 241 42
go 0 241 42
home 0 241 42
again." 0 241 42

Traditionalists 0 241 43
have 0 241 43
been 0 241 43
told 0 241 43
that 0 241 43
for 0 241 43
years. 0 241 43

Now 0 241 44
it's 0 241 44
the 0 241 44
turn 0 241 44
of 0 241 44
the 0 241 44
GOP 0 241 44
establishment 0 241 44
to 0 241 44
learn 0 241 44
the 0 241 44
truth 0 241 44
as 0 241 44
well. 0 241 44

Goldwater 0 241 45
lost 0 241 45
badly, 0 241 45
but 0 241 45
the 0 241 45
establishment 0 241 45

Saucier 0 245 23
confessed 0 245 23
to 0 245 23
taking 0 245 23

a 0 245 23
22-year-old 0 245 23

the 0 245 24
FBI 0 245 24

all 0 245 24

with 0 245 24
unauthorized 0 245 24
people. 0 245 24

“It 0 245 25
was 0 245 25
a 0 245 25
foolish 1 245 25
mistake 0 245 25
by 0 245 25
a 0 245 25
very 0 245 25
young 0 245 25
man,” 0 245 25
Saucier’s 0 245 25
lawyer, 0 245 25
Greg 0 245 25
Rinckey, 0 245 25
said. 0 245 25

“It’s 0 245 26
a 0 245 26
very 0 245 26
sad 0 245 26
case 0 245 26
because 0 245 26
Kristian 0 245 26
Saucier 0 245 26
is 0 245 26
a 1 245 26
fine 1 245 26
young 1 245 26
man. 1 245 26

We 0 245 27
don’t 0 245 27
believe 0 245 27
this 0 245 27
was 0 245 27
really 0 245 27
his 0 245 27
true 0 245 27
character.” 0 245 27

“My 0 245 28
case 0 245 28
was 0 245 28
usually 0 245 28
something 0 245 28
handled 0 245 28
by 0 245 28
military 0 245 28
courts,” 0 245 28
Saucier 0 245 28
said. 0 245 28

“They 1 245 29
used 1 245 29
me 1 245 29
as 1 245 29
an 1 245 29
example 1 245 29
because 1 245 29
of 1 245 29
[the 1 245 29
backlash 1 245 29
over] 1 245 29
Hillary 1 245 29
Clinton,” 1 245 29
he 0 245 29
continued, 0 245 29
alleging 0 245 29
his 0 245 29
life 0 245 29
was 0 245 29
ruined 0 245 29
for 0 245 29
political 0 245 29
reasons. 0 245 29

President 0 245 30
Trump 0 245 30
had 0 245 30
spoken 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
his 0 245 30
support 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
Saucier 0 245 30
on 0 245 30
the 0 245 30
campaign 0 245 30
trail 0 245 30
and 0 245 30
blasted 0 245 30
the 0 245 30
Obama 0 245 30
administration's 0 245 30
handling 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
his 0 245 30
case. 0 245 30

“With 0 245 31
a 0 245 31
pardon, 0 245 31
there’s 0 245 31
no 0 245 31
magic 0 245 31
wand 0 245 31
that 0 245 31
gets 0 245 31
waved 0 245 31
and 0 245 31
makes 0 245 31
everything 0 245 31
right,” 0 245 31
Saucier 0 245 31
said, 0 245 31
“But 0 245 31
I 0 245 31
try 0 245 31
to 0 245 31
stay 0 245 31
positive 0 245 31
and 0 245 31
look 0 245 31
forward.” 0 245 31

That's 0 245 32
a 0 245 32
good 0 245 32
attitude 0 245 32
considering 0 245 32
he 0 245 32
has 0 245 32
had 0 245 32
his 0 245 32
cars 0 245 32
repossessed 0 245 32
and 0 245 32
is 0 245 32
in 0 245 32
a 0 245 32
tremendous 1 245 32
amount 0 245 32
of 0 245 32
debt 0 245 32
due 0 245 32
to 0 245 32
his 0 245 32
incarceration 0 245 32
and 0 245 32
now 0 245 32
having 0 245 32
a 0 245 32
felony 0 245 32
on 0 245 32
his 0 245 32
record. 0 245 32

But 0 245 33
hey, 0 245 33
Hillary 0 245 33
is 0 245 33
free, 0 245 33
right? 0 245 33

That's 0 245 34
all 0 245 34
that 0 245 34
matters, 0 245 34
cause 0 245 34
after 0 245 34
all, 0 245 34
they're 0 245 34
(Bill 0 245 34
and 0 245 34
Hillary) 0 245 34
good 0 245 34
people, 0 245 34
aren't 0 245 34
they, 0 245 34
Mr. 0 245 34
President? 0 245 34

I 0 245 35
think 0 245 35
it's 0 245 35
great 0 245 35
that 0 245 35
Mr. 0 245 35
Saucier 0 245 35
has 0 245 35
been 0 245 35
pardoned, 0 245 35
I 0 245 35
really 0 245 35
do, 0 245 35
but 0 245 35
I 0 245 35
continue 0 245 35
to 0 245 35
ask 0 245 35
what 0 245 35
a 0 245 35
lot 0 245 35
of 0 245 35
Americans 1 245 35
continue 0 245 35

ask, 0 245 35
why 0 245 35
does 0 245 35
the 1 245 35
known 1 245 35
criminal 1 245 35
Hillary 0 245 35

the 0 246 29
subject 0 246 29
of 0 246 29
a 0 246 29
rape 0 246 29
trial. 0 246 29

So, 0 246 30
expose 1 246 30
the 1 246 30
Islamists 1 246 30
fro 1 246 30
who 1 246 30
and 1 246 30
what 1 246 30
they 1 246 30
are 1 246 30
and 1 246 30
what 1 246 30
Islam's 1 246 30
founder 1 246 30
not 1 246 30
only 1 246 30
taught 1 246 30
them, 1 246 30
but 1 246 30
modeled 1 246 30
for 1 246 30
them, 1 246 30
and 0 246 30
you 0 246 30
may 0 246 30
just 0 246 30
find 0 246 30

Since 0 249 16

2017 0 249 16

As 0 249 17
far 0 249 17
as 0 249 17
the 0 249 17
labor 0 249 17
market 0 249 17

concerned, 0 249 17
“America 1 249 17

not 0 249 17
translated 0 249 17
to 0 249 17
Americans 0 249 17
First. 0 249 17

In 0 249 18
normal 0 249 18
times, 0 249 18
this 0 249 18
might 0 249 18
be 0 249 18
a 0 249 18
big 0 249 18
story. 0 249 18

But 0 249 19

anyway, 0 249 20

dimension. 0 249 20

However, 0 249 21
it 0 249 21
is 0 249 21
now 0 249 21
absolutely 0 249 21
clear 0 249 21

If 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
Omani 0 251 10
bank 0 251 10
had 0 251 10
allowed 0 251 10
the 0 251 10

without 0 251 10
such 0 251 10
a 0 251 10

it 0 251 10

system. 0 251 10

The 0 251 11
effort 0 251 11
was 0 251 11
unsuccessful 0 251 11
because 0 251 11
American 0 251 11
banks 0 251 11
— 0 251 11
themselves 0 251 11
afraid 0 251 11
of 0 251 11
running 0 251 11
afoul 0 251 11
of 0 251 11
U.S. 0 251 11
sanctions 0 251 11
— 0 251 11
declined 0 251 11
to 0 251 11
participate. 0 251 11

The 0 251 12
Obama 0 251 12
administration 0 251 12
approached 0 251 12
two 0 251 12
U.S. 0 251 12
banks 0 251 12
to 0 251 12
facilitate 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
conversion, 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
report 0 251 12
said, 0 251 12
but 0 251 12
both 0 251 12
refused, 0 251 12
citing 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
reputational 0 251 12
risk 0 251 12
of 0 251 12
doing 0 251 12
business 0 251 12
with 0 251 12
or 0 251 12
for 0 251 12
Iran. 0 251 12

That's 0 251 13
how 0 251 13
bad 1 251 13
Obama 0 251 13
was 0 251 13
on 0 251 13
Iran. 0 251 13

The 0 251 14
banking 0 251 14
system 0 251 14
was 0 251 14
more 0 251 14
reluctant 0 251 14
to 0 251 14
help 0 251 14
Iran 0 251 14
launder 0 251 14
money 0 251 14
than 0 251 14
he 0 251 14
was. 0 251 14

Nor 0 251 15
was 0 251 15
Obama 0 251 15
worried 0 251 15
about 0 251 15
the 0 251 15
reputational 0 251 15
risk 0 251 15
of 0 251 15
loading 0 251 15
foreign 0 251 15
currency 0 251 15
on 0 251 15
unmarked 0 251 15
cargo 0 251 15
planes 0 251 15
and 0 251 15
flying 0 251 15
it 0 251 15
to 0 251 15
Iran. 0 251 15

Issuing 0 251 16
the 0 251 16
license 0 251 16
was 0 251 16
not 0 251 16
illegal. 0 251 16

Still, 0 251 17
it 0 251 17
went 0 251 17
above 0 251 17
and 0 251 17
beyond 0 251 17
what 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
Obama 0 251 17
administration 0 251 17
was 0 251 17
required 0 251 17
to 0 251 17
do 0 251 17
under 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
terms 0 251 17
of 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
nuclear 0 251 17
agreement. 0 251 17

Except 0 251 18
Obama 0 251 18
Inc. 0 251 18
weren't 0 251 18
trying 0 251 18
to 0 251 18
drive 0 251 18
a 0 251 18
hard 0 251 18
bargain. 0 251 18

So 0 251 19
they 0 251 19
didn't 0 251 19
stick 0 251 19
to 0 251 19
it. 0 251 19

They 0 251 20
were 0 251 20
trying 0 251 20
to 0 251 20
aid 0 251 20
Iran. 0 251 20

Shortly 0 251 21
after 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
nuclear 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
was 0 251 21
sealed 0 251 21
in 0 251 21
July 0 251 21
2015, 0 251 21
then-Treasury 0 251 21
Secretary 0 251 21
Jack 0 251 21
Lew 0 251 21
testified 0 251 21
that 0 251 21
even 0 251 21
with 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
sanctions 0 251 21
relief, 0 251 21
Iran 0 251 21
“will 0 251 21
continue 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
be 0 251 21
denied 0 251 21
access 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
largest 0 251 21
financial 0 251 21
and 0 251 21
commercial 0 251 21
market.” 0 251 21
A 0 251 21
month 0 251 21
later, 0 251 21
one 0 251 21
of 0 251 21
Lew’s 0 251 21
top 0 251 21
deputies, 0 251 21
Adam 0 251 21
Szubin, 0 251 21
testified 0 251 21
that 0 251 21
despite 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
nuclear 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
“Iran 0 251 21
will 0 251 21
be 0 251 21
denied 0 251 21
access 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
most 1 251 21
important 1 251 21
market 1 251 21
and 0 251 21
unable 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
in 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
most 1 251 21
important 1 251 21
currency.” 1 251 21

This 0 251 22
was 0 251 22
typical 0 251 22
of 0 251 22
the 0 251 22
worthless 1 251 22
assurances 0 251 22
that 0 251 22
Obama 0 251 22
officials 0 251 22
made. 0 251 22

And 0 251 23
disgraced 1 251 23
themselves 0 251 23
by 0 251 23
doing 0 251 23
so. 0 251 23

Obama 0 251 24
administration 0 251 24
officials 0 251 24
at 0 251 24
the 0 251 24
time 0 251 24
assured 0 251 24
concerned 0 251 24
lawmakers 0 251 24
that 0 251 24
a 0 251 24
general 0 251 24
license 0 251 24
wouldn’t 0 251 24
be 0 251 24
coming. 0 251 24

But 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
report 0 251 25
from 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
Republican 0 251 25
members 0 251 25
of 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
Senate 0 251 25
panel 0 251 25
showed 0 251 25
that 0 251 25
a 0 251 25
draft 0 251 25
of 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
license 0 251 25
was 0 251 25
indeed 0 251 25
prepared, 0 251 25
though 0 251 25
it 0 251 25
was 0 251 25
never 0 251 25
published. 0 251 25

And 0 251 26
when 0 251 26
questioned 0 251 26
by 0 251 26
lawmakers 0 251 26
about 0 251 26

never 0 251 26

his 0 316 1

John 0 316 2
Pilger: 0 316 2
His 0 316 2
state 0 316 2
of 0 316 2
health 0 316 2
is 0 316 2
just 0 316 2
about 0 316 2
the 0 316 2
same, 0 316 2
as 0 316 2
I 0 316 2
understand 0 316 2
it. 0 316 2

He 0 316 3
needs 0 316 3
medical 0 316 3
attention, 0 316 3
the 0 316 3
kind 0 316 3
of 0 316 3
treatment 0 316 3
you 0 316 3
get 0 316 3
only 0 316 3
in 0 316 3
a 0 316 3
hospital. 0 316 3

But 0 316 4
it 0 316 4
has 0 316 4
been 0 316 4
made 0 316 4
clear 0 316 4
to 0 316 4
him 0 316 4
that 0 316 4
if 0 316 4
he 0 316 4
attempts 0 316 4
to 0 316 4
go 0 316 4
to 0 316 4
a 0 316 4
hospital 0 316 4
he 0 316 4
will 0 316 4
not 0 316 4
be 0 316 4
given 0 316 4
free 0 316 4
passage 0 316 4
and 0 316 4
he 0 316 4
will 0 316 4
be 0 316 4
arrested. 0 316 4

Since 0 316 5
he 0 316 5
was 0 316 5
arrested 0 316 5
in 0 316 5
2010, 0 316 5
Assange 0 316 5
has 0 316 5
not 0 316 5
been 0 316 5
charged 0 316 5
with 0 316 5
a 0 316 5
single 0 316 5
crime. 0 316 5

His 0 316 6
treatment 0 316 6
amounts 0 316 6
to 0 316 6
the 1 316 6
most 1 316 6
unprecedented 1 316 6
persecution. 1 316 6

Julian 0 316 7
could 0 316 7
leave 0 316 7
the 0 316 7
embassy 0 316 7
if 0 316 7
his 1 316 7
own 1 316 7
government, 1 316 7
the 1 316 7
government 1 316 7
of 1 316 7
his 1 316 7
homeland, 1 316 7
Australia, 1 316 7
applied 1 316 7
legitimate 1 316 7
diplomatic 1 316 7
pressure 1 316 7
on 1 316 7
behalf 1 316 7
of 1 316 7
its 1 316 7
citizen. 1 316 7

We 1 316 8
must 1 316 8
ask 1 316 8
ourselves 1 316 8
why 1 316 8
this 1 316 8
hasn’t 1 316 8
happened. 1 316 8

My 0 316 9
own 0 316 9
feeling 0 316 9
is 0 316 9
that 0 316 9
there 0 316 9
is 0 316 9
a 0 316 9
great 0 316 9
deal 0 316 9
of 0 316 9
collusion 0 316 9
between 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
Australian, 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
British 0 316 9
and 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
US 0 316 9
governments–meant 0 316 9
to 0 316 9
close 0 316 9
down 0 316 9
WikiLeaks 0 316 9
completely 0 316 9
and/or 0 316 9
deliver 0 316 9
Julian 0 316 9
Assange 0 316 9
to 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
Americans. 0 316 9

Recently 0 316 10
the 0 316 10
Australian 0 316 10
foreign 0 316 10
minister, 0 316 10
Julie 0 316 10
Bishop, 0 316 10
traveled 0 316 10
with 0 316 10
senior 0 316 10
officials 0 316 10
to 0 316 10
London 0 316 10
and 0 316 10
to 0 316 10
Washington 0 316 10
and 0 316 10
raised 0 316 10
the 0 316 10
whole 0 316 10
matter 0 316 10
of 0 316 10
Julian. 0 316 10

But 0 316 11
they 0 316 11
raised 0 316 11
it 0 316 11
in 0 316 11
a 0 316 11
way 0 316 11
that 0 316 11
didn’t 0 316 11
support 0 316 11
the 0 316 11
idea 0 316 11
that 0 316 11
a 0 316 11
government 0 316 11
should 0 316 11
represent 0 316 11
its 0 316 11
citizens. 0 316 11

These 0 316 12
people 0 316 12
listened 0 316 12
to 0 316 12
the 0 316 12
more 0 316 12
powerful 0 316 12
governments. 0 316 12

In 0 316 13
Washington 0 316 13
they 0 316 13
met 0 316 13
Mr. 0 316 13
Pompeo, 0 316 13
who 0 316 13
refused 0 316 13
to 0 316 13
discuss 0 316 13
Assange 0 316 13
altogether. 0 316 13

I 0 316 14
think 0 316 14
there 0 316 14
is 0 316 14
collusion 0 316 14
which 0 316 14
amounts 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
an 0 316 14
attempt 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
try 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
do 0 316 14
a 0 316 14
deal 0 316 14
with 0 316 14
Assange 0 316 14
whereby 0 316 14
he 0 316 14
might 0 316 14
be 0 316 14
allowed 0 316 14
free 0 316 14
passage 0 316 14
of 0 316 14
return 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
Australia 0 316 14
if 0 316 14
he 0 316 14
shuts 0 316 14
down 0 316 14
WikiLeaks. 0 316 14

I 0 316 15
think 0 316 15
that 0 316 15
is 0 316 15
very, 0 316 15
very 0 316 15
likely. 0 316 15

As 0 316 16
I 0 316 16
understand 0 316 16
Julian, 0 316 16
this 0 316 16
is 0 316 16
something 1 316 16
he 1 316 16
would 1 316 16
not 1 316 16
even 1 316 16
contemplate. 1 316 16

But 0 316 17
that 0 316 17
might 0 316 17
be 0 316 17
one 0 316 17
of 0 316 17
the 0 316 17
so-called 0 316 17
“wretched 1 316 17
deals” 1 316 17
that 0 316 17
are 0 316 17
being 0 316 17
offered 0 316 17
Assange. 0 316 17

Some 0 316 18
very 0 316 18
strange 0 316 18
things 0 316 18
are 0 316 18
being 0 316 18
said 0 316 18
by 0 316 18
senior 0 316 18

when 1 316 19
he 1 316 19
came 1 316 19
out, 1 316 19
when 0 316 19
he 0 316 19
would 0 316 19
face 0 316 19
serious 0 316 19
charges. 0 316 19

There 0 316 20
are 0 316 20
no 0 316 20
serious 0 316 20
charges. 0 316 20

time 1 316 31
as 1 316 31
a 1 316 31
journalist 1 316 31
has 1 316 31
equaled 1 316 31
the 1 316 31
rise 1 316 31
of 1 316 31
WikiLeaks 1 316 31
and 1 316 31
its 1 316 31
extraordinary 1 316 31
impact 1 316 31
on 1 316 31
journalism. 1 316 31

It 0 316 32
is 0 316 32
probably 0 316 32
the 1 316 32
only 1 316 32
journalistic 1 316 32
organization 1 316 32
that 1 316 32
has 1 316 32
a 1 316 32
100% 1 316 32
record 1 316 32
of 1 316 32
accuracy 1 316 32
and 1 316 32
authenticity! 1 316 32

All 0 316 33
of 0 316 33
WikiLeaks’ 0 316 33
revelations 0 316 33
have 0 316 33
been 0 316 33
authentic. 0 316 33

And 0 316 34
it 0 316 34
has 0 316 34
been 0 316 34
done 0 316 34
“without 0 316 34
fear 0 316 34
or 0 316 34
favor.” 0 316 34
Although 0 316 34
there 0 316 34
has 0 316 34
been 0 316 34
a 0 316 34
concentration 0 316 34
on, 0 316 34
say, 0 316 34
the 0 316 34

WikiLeaks 0 316 34
has 0 316 34
released 0 316 34

have 0 316 34
a 0 316 34

across 0 316 34
the 0 316 34
spectrum. 0 316 34

It 0 316 35
has 0 316 35
released 0 316 35
something 0 316 35
like 0 316 35
800,000 0 316 35
documents 0 316 35

Russia, 0 316 35
and 0 316 35
now 0 316 35
WikiLeaks 0 316 35
is 0 316 35
accused 0 316 35
of 0 316 35
being 0 316 35
an 0 316 35
agent 0 316 35

WikiLeaks’ 0 316 36

covered 0 316 36
a 0 316 36

first 0 316 36
time 0 316 36
this 0 316 36

WikiLeaks 0 316 38

of 0 316 38
what 0 316 38
their 0 316 38

was 0 316 38
doing 0 316 38
behind 0 316 38
their 0 316 38
backs. 0 316 38

In 0 316 39
Venezuela, 0 316 39
WikiLeaks 0 316 39
released 0 316 39
cables 0 316 39
which 0 316 39
described 0 316 39
in 0 316 39
great 0 316 39
detail 0 316 39
how 0 316 39
the 0 316 39
United 0 316 39
States 0 316 39
intended 0 316 39
to 0 316 39
subvert 0 316 39
the 0 316 39
government 0 316 39
of 0 316 39
Hugo 0 316 39
Chavez. 0 316 39

Some 0 316 40
of 0 316 40
this 0 316 40
was 0 316 40
published 0 316 40
in 0 316 40
the 0 316 40
mainstream 0 316 40
media, 0 316 40
when 0 316 40
there 0 316 40
was 0 316 40
still 0 316 40
a 0 316 40
collaboration 0 316 40
with 0 316 40
WikiLeaks. 0 316 40

The 0 316 41
Clinton/Podesta 0 316 41
emails, 0 316 41
which 0 316 41
appear 0 316 41
to 0 316 41
have 0 316 41
made 0 316 41
a 0 316 41
number 0 316 41
of 0 316 41
people 0 316 41
resentful, 0 316 41
were 0 316 41
published 0 316 41
in 0 316 41
the 0 316 41
New 0 316 41
York 0 316 41
Times. 0 316 41

These 0 316 42
emails 0 316 42
showed 0 316 42
the 0 316 42
close 0 316 42
role 0 316 42
that 0 316 42
Hillary 0 316 42
Clinton 0 316 42
and 0 316 42
the 0 316 42

in 0 316 42
support 0 316 42
of 0 316 42
extreme 1 316 42
jihadism 1 316 42
in 0 316 42
the 0 316 42
Middle 0 316 42
East. 0 316 42

That 0 316 43
was 0 316 43
a 0 316 43
very 0 316 43
important 0 316 43
piece 0 316 43
of 0 316 43

people 0 316 43

and 0 316 43
understand. 0 316 43

By 0 316 44
doing 0 316 44
that, 0 316 44
WikiLeaks 0 316 44
performed 0 316 44
an 1 316 44
extraordinary 1 316 44
public 1 316 44
service, 1 316 44
while 0 316 44

him 0 316 46

JP: 0 316 48
Julian 0 316 48
is 0 316 48
a 1 316 48
very 1 316 48
principled 1 316 48
individual. 1 316 48

He 0 316 49
feels 0 316 49
very 0 316 49
strongly 0 316 49
about 0 316 49
the 0 316 49
moral 0 316 49
basis 0 316 49
of 0 316 49
WikiLeaks. 0 316 49

When 0 316 50
he 0 316 50
first 0 316 50
put 0 316 50
up 0 316 50
WikiLeaks, 0 316 50
he 0 316 50
wrote 0 316 50
that 0 316 50
the 0 316 50
whole 0 316 50
idea 0 316 50
of 0 316 50
transparency, 0 316 50
honoring 0 316 50
people’s 0 316 50
right 0 316 50
to 0 316 50

was 0 316 50
the 0 316 50
central 0 316 50
aim 0 316 50
of 0 316 50
the 0 316 50
website. 0 316 50

He 0 316 51
feels 0 316 51
that 0 316 51
very 0 316 51
strongly. 0 316 51

Any 0 316 52
attempt 0 316 52
to 0 316 52
do 0 316 52
a 0 316 52
deal 0 316 52

Julian 0 316 52
to 0 316 52
shut 0 316 52
down 0 316 52
WikiLeaks 0 316 52
will 0 316 52
no 0 316 52
doubt 0 316 52
be 0 316 52
resisted. 0 316 52

As 0 316 53
a 0 316 53
person, 0 316 53
Julian 0 316 53
is 0 316 53
an 1 316 53
extremely 1 316 53
interesting 1 316 53
man. 1 316 53

He 0 316 54
is 0 316 54
very 0 316 54
well 0 316 54
read. 0 316 54

He 0 316 55
studied 0 316 55
physics. 0 316 55

He 0 316 56
has 0 316 56
a 0 316 56
very 0 316 56
good 0 316 56
sense 0 316 56
of 0 316 56
humor, 0 316 56
and 0 316 56
I 0 316 56
have 0 316 56
often 0 316 56
laughed 0 316 56
out 0 316 56
loud 0 316 56
with 0 316 56
him 0 316 56
about 0 316 56
situations 0 316 56
that 0 316 56
others 0 316 56
might 0 316 56
consider 0 316 56
too 0 316 56
bleak 0 316 56
to 0 316 56
discuss. 0 316 56

His 0 316 57
black 0 316 57
humor 0 316 57
is 0 316 57
a 0 316 57
part 0 316 57
of 0 316 57
his 0 316 57
survival 0 316 57
kit. 0 316 57

Obviously, 0 316 58
he 0 316 58
is 0 316 58
incredibly 0 316 58
resilient. 0 316 58

Personally, 0 316 59
I 0 316 59
could 0 316 59
never 0 316 59
endure 0 316 59
what 0 316 59
he 0 316 59
has, 0 316 59
especially 0 316 59
in 0 316 59
recent 0 316 59
years. 0 316 59

But 0 316 60
this 0 316 60
comes 0 316 60
with 0 316 60
a 0 316 60
cost 0 316 60
and 0 316 60
his 0 316 60
health 0 316 60
is 0 316 60
continuing 0 316 60
to 0 316 60
deteriorate. 0 316 60

Those 0 316 61
close 0 316 61
to 0 316 61
him 0 316 61
are 0 316 61
extremely 1 316 61
worried. 1 316 61

of 0 316 71
its 0 316 71
academic 0 316 71
life 0 316 71
and 0 316 71
certainly 0 316 71
much 0 316 71
of 0 316 71
its 0 316 71
media 0 316 71
is 0 316 71
integrated 0 316 71
into 0 316 71
the 0 316 71
US 0 316 71
system. 0 316 71

That 0 316 72
is 0 316 72
not 0 316 72
entirely 0 316 72
the 0 316 72
case 0 316 72
in 0 316 72
Britain. 0 316 72

Since 0 316 73
the 0 316 73
loss 0 316 73
of 0 316 73
its 0 316 73
empire 0 316 73
after 0 316 73
the 0 316 73
Second 0 316 73
World 0 316 73
War, 0 316 73
Britain 0 316 73
has 0 316 73
been 0 316 73
eager 0 316 73
to 0 316 73
play 0 316 73
a 0 316 73
secondary 0 316 73
role 0 316 73
to 0 316 73
the 0 316 73
new 0 316 73
imperial 0 316 73
power. 0 316 73

In 0 316 74
many 0 316 74
parts 0 316 74
of 0 316 74
the 0 316 74
world, 0 316 74
Britain 0 316 74
is 0 316 74
still 0 316 74
the 0 316 74
biggest 0 316 74
corporate 0 316 74
investor. 0 316 74

But 0 316 75
it 1 316 75
does 1 316 75
move 1 316 75
in 1 316 75
lockstep 1 316 75
with 1 316 75
the 1 316 75
US 1 316 75
on 0 316 75
much 0 316 75
of 0 316 75
its 0 316 75
foreign 0 316 75
policy. 0 316 75

It 0 316 76
is 0 316 76
interesting 0 316 76
to 0 316 76
see 0 316 76
the 0 316 76
corruption 0 316 76
that 0 316 76
this 0 316 76
kind 0 316 76
of 0 316 76
relationship 0 316 76
produces. 0 316 76

Information 0 316 77
has 0 316 77
come 0 316 77
out 0 316 77
that 0 316 77
the 0 316 77
Crown 0 316 77
Prosecution 0 316 77
Service 0 316 77
tried 0 316 77
to 0 316 77
prevent 0 316 77
the 0 316 77
Swedes 0 316 77
from 0 316 77
giving 0 316 77
up 0 316 77
the 0 316 77
case 0 316 77
against 0 316 77
Julian 0 316 77
on 0 316 77
bogus 1 316 77
sexual 1 316 77
assault 1 316 77
charges. 1 316 77

The 0 316 78
pressure 0 316 78
was 0 316 78
on 0 316 78
from 0 316 78
London 0 316 78
to 0 316 78
keep 0 316 78
it 0 316 78
going. 0 316 78

Julian 0 316 79
is 0 316 79
also 0 316 79
seen 0 316 79
as 0 316 79
defying 0 316 79
a 0 316 79
system 0 316 79
and 0 316 79
that 0 316 79
is 0 316 79
just 0 316 79
not 0 316 79
acceptable. 0 316 79

There 0 316 80
is 0 316 80
a 0 316 80
real 0 316 80
element 0 316 80
of 0 316 80
vindictiveness 0 316 80
here. 0 316 80

The 0 316 81
Crown 0 316 81
Prosecution 0 316 81
Service 0 316 81
kept 0 316 81
this 0 316 81
case 0 316 81
going 0 316 81
when 0 316 81
otherwise 0 316 81
the 0 316 81
European 0 316 81
warrant 0 316 81
put 0 316 81
out 0 316 81
by 0 316 81
the 0 316 81
Swedes 0 316 81
would 0 316 81
have 0 316 81
been 0 316 81
abandoned 0 316 81
in 0 316 81
2013. 0 316 81

When 0 316 82
Julian 0 316 82
came 0 316 82
up 0 316 82
to 0 316 82
a 0 316 82
bail 0 316 82
hearing 0 316 82
last 0 316 82
year, 0 316 82
it 1 316 82
was 1 316 82
an 1 316 82
absolute 1 316 82
disgrace. 1 316 82

The 0 316 83
judge 0 316 83
described 0 316 83
Julian’s 0 316 83
circumstances 0 316 83
as 0 316 83
if 0 316 83
he 0 316 83
were 0 316 83
on 0 316 83
some 0 316 83
sort 0 316 83
of 0 316 83
extended 0 316 83
vacation. 0 316 83

What 1 316 84
didn’t 1 316 84
emerge 1 316 84
was 1 316 84
the 1 316 84
whole 1 316 84
conflict 1 316 84
of 1 316 84
interest 1 316 84
in 1 316 84
this 1 316 84
hearing. 1 316 84

The 1 316 85
judge’s 1 316 85
husband 1 316 85
is 1 316 85
a 1 316 85
figure 1 316 85
deep 1 316 85
within 1 316 85
the 1 316 85
national 1 316 85
security 1 316 85
establishment 1 316 85
in 1 316 85
Britain 1 316 85
who 1 316 85
was 1 316 85
named 1 316 85
in 1 316 85
WikiLeaks 1 316 85
documents. 1 316 85

Because 1 316 86
there 1 316 86
is 1 316 86
no 1 316 86
serious 1 316 86
media 1 316 86
examining 1 316 86
the 1 316 86
whole 1 316 86

witch 1 316 86
hunt, 1 316 86
virtually 1 316 86
none 1 316 86
of 1 316 86
this 1 316 86
emerges. 1 316 86

DB: 0 316 87
The 0 316 87

major 0 316 87
responsibility 0 316 87
if 0 316 87
Julian 0 316 87

goes 0 316 87
down, 0 316 87
don’t 0 316 87
you 0 316 87
agree? 0 316 87

JP: 0 316 88
As 0 316 88
you 0 316 88
know, 0 316 88
Dennis, 0 316 88
governments 0 316 88
do 0 316 88

to 0 316 88
pressure 0 316 88
from 0 316 88
powerful 0 316 88
media 0 316 88
interests. 0 316 88

It 0 316 89
rarely 0 316 89
happens 0 316 89
but 0 316 89
when 0 316 89
it 0 316 89
does 0 316 89
governments 0 316 89
do 0 316 89
change 0 316 89
their 0 316 89

There 0 316 90
has 0 316 90
been 0 316 90
no 0 316 90
pressure 0 316 90
from 0 316 90

You 1 316 91
are 1 316 91
absolutely 1 316 91
right 1 316 91
in 0 316 91

the 0 316 91

what 0 316 91

is 0 316 91
undeniable. 0 316 91

I 0 316 92
was 0 316 92
looking 0 316 92
this 0 316 92
morning 0 316 92
at 0 316 92
a 0 316 92
report 0 316 92
by 0 316 92
Media 0 316 92
Lens 0 316 92
in 0 316 92
Britain 0 316 92
describing 0 316 92
how 0 316 92
the 0 316 92
British 0 316 92
press 0 316 92
has 0 316 92
reported 0 316 92
on 0 316 92
Julian 0 316 92
Assange. 0 316 92

It 0 316 93
describes 0 316 93
the 1 316 93
tsunami 1 316 93
of 1 316 93
vindictive 1 316 93
personal 1 316 93
abuse 1 316 93
that 0 316 93
has 0 316 93
been 0 316 93
heaped 1 316 93
upon 1 316 93
Julian 0 316 93
from 0 316 93
well-known 0 316 93
journalists, 0 316 93
many 0 316 93
claiming 0 316 93
liberal 0 316 93
credentials. 0 316 93

The 0 316 94
Guardian, 0 316 94
which 1 316 94
used 1 316 94
to 1 316 94
consider 1 316 94
itself 1 316 94
the 1 316 94
most 1 316 94
enlightened 1 316 94
newspaper 1 316 94
in 1 316 94
the 1 316 94
country, 1 316 94
has 0 316 94
probably 0 316 94
been 0 316 94
the 0 316 94
worst. 0 316 94

The 0 316 95
frontal 0 316 95
attacks 0 316 95
have 0 316 95
been 0 316 95
coming 0 316 95
not 0 316 95
from 0 316 95
governments 0 316 95
but 0 316 95
from 0 316 95
journalists. 0 316 95

I 0 316 96
described 0 316 96
this 0 316 96
recently 0 316 96
as 0 316 96
“Vichy 1 316 96
journalism,” 1 316 96
a 0 316 96
term 0 316 96
which 0 316 96
now 0 316 96
fits 0 316 96
so 0 316 96
much 0 316 96
of 0 316 96
the 0 316 96
mainstream 0 316 96
media. 0 316 96

It 1 316 97
collaborates 1 316 97
in 1 316 97
the 1 316 97
same 1 316 97
way 1 316 97
that 1 316 97
the 1 316 97
Vichy 1 316 97
government 1 316 97
in 1 316 97
France 1 316 97

always 0 316 101
worked 0 316 101
within 0 316 101

journalism 0 316 101
I 0 316 101
see 0 316 101
now 0 316 101
is 0 316 101
part 0 316 101
of 0 316 101
a 1 316 101
rapacious 1 316 101

is 1 316 102
precisely 1 316 102
because 1 316 102
WikiLeaks 1 316 102
is 1 316 102
producing 1 316 102
the 1 316 102
kind 1 316 102
of 1 316 102

don’t 0 316 106
believe 0 316 106
it 0 316 106

It’s 0 316 110
very 0 316 110
simple. 0 316 110

This 0 316 111
is 0 316 111
about 0 316 111
justice. 0 316 111

In 0 316 112
a 0 316 112
famous 0 316 112
speech 0 316 112
given 0 316 112
in 0 316 112
the 0 316 112
1930’s 0 316 112
by 0 316 112
Parson 0 316 112
Martin 0 316 112
Niemoller, 0 316 112
he 0 316 112
said 0 316 112
that 0 316 112
first 0 316 112
the 0 316 112
Nazis 0 316 112
came 0 316 112
for 0 316 112
socialists, 0 316 112
but 0 316 112
he 0 316 112
didn’t 0 316 112
speak 0 316 112
up 0 316 112
because 0 316 112
that 0 316 112
didn’t 0 316 112
concern 0 316 112
him. 0 316 112

Then 0 316 113
they 0 316 113
came 0 316 113
for 0 316 113
trade 0 316 113
unionists, 0 316 113
but 0 316 113
he 0 316 113
didn’t 0 316 113
speak 0 316 113
up 0 316 113
because 0 316 113
that 0 316 113
didn’t 0 316 113
concern 0 316 113
him. 0 316 113

He 0 316 114
didn’t 0 316 114
speak 0 316 114
up 0 316 114
when 0 316 114
they 0 316 114
came 0 316 114
for 0 316 114
the 0 316 114
Jews 0 316 114
because 0 316 114
he 0 316 114
wasn’t 0 316 114
a 0 316 114
Jew. 0 316 114

And, 0 316 115
of 0 316 115
course, 0 316 115
finally 0 316 115
they 0 316 115
came 0 316 115
for 0 316 115
him. 0 316 115

we 0 316 117

kept 0 316 117
quiet. 0 316 117

Hebda 0 319 1
of 0 319 1
St. 0 319 1
Paul, 0 319 1

responds 0 319 1
to 0 319 1
the 0 319 1
McCarrick 0 319 1
scandal 0 319 1
(The 0 319 1
Catholic 0 319 1
Spirit): 0 319 1

Every 0 319 2
time 0 319 2
Mass 0 319 2
is 0 319 2
celebrated, 0 319 2
the 0 319 2
priest 0 319 2
prays 0 319 2
that 0 319 2
Jesus 0 319 2
will 0 319 2
“look 0 319 2
not 0 319 2
on 0 319 2
our 0 319 2
sins 0 319 2
but 0 319 2
on 0 319 2
the 0 319 2
faith 0 319 2
of 0 319 2
[his] 0 319 2
Church… 0 319 2
.” 0 319 2
That’s 0 319 2
been 0 319 2
an 0 319 2
important 0 319 2
prayer 0 319 2
for 0 319 2
me 0 319 2
in 0 319 2
the 0 319 2
time 0 319 2
that 0 319 2
I 0 319 2
have 0 319 2
been 0 319 2
serving 0 319 2
this 0 319 2
archdiocese, 0 319 2
well 0 319 2
aware 0 319 2
of 0 319 2
our 0 319 2
sins 0 319 2
but 0 319 2
equally 0 319 2
aware 0 319 2
of 0 319 2
the 1 319 2
strong 1 319 2
and 1 319 2
vibrant 1 319 2
faith 1 319 2
of 0 319 2
this 0 319 2
local 0 319 2
Church. 0 319 2

I’ve 0 319 3
been 0 319 3
praying 0 319 3
that 0 319 3
prayer 0 319 3
even 0 319 3
more 0 319 3
earnestly 0 319 3
in 0 319 3
these 0 319 3
past 0 319 3
weeks 0 319 3
as 0 319 3
the 0 319 3
Church 0 319 3
in 0 319 3
the 0 319 3
United 0 319 3
States 0 319 3
has 0 319 3
once 0 319 3
again 0 319 3
come 0 319 3
face-to-face 0 319 3
with 0 319 3
its 0 319 3
sins, 0 319 3
with 0 319 3
reports 0 319 3
that 0 319 3
former 0 319 3
cardinal 0 319 3
Theodore 0 319 3
McCarrick, 0 319 3
one 1 319 3
of 1 319 3
the 1 319 3
most 1 319 3
prominent 1 319 3
Churchmen 1 319 3
in 1 319 3
the 1 319 3
United 1 319 3
States 1 319 3
in 1 319 3
the 1 319 3
last 1 319 3
quarter 1 319 3
century, 1 319 3
has 0 319 3
been 0 319 3
accused 0 319 3
of 0 319 3
abusing 0 319 3
two 0 319 3
minors 0 319 3
and 0 319 3
sexually 0 319 3
harassing 0 319 3
or 0 319 3
assaulting 0 319 3
a 0 319 3
number 0 319 3
of 0 319 3
seminarians 0 319 3
and 0 319 3
young 0 319 3
priests. 0 319 3

To 1 319 4
make 1 319 4
matters 1 319 4
worse 1 319 4
(if 1 319 4
that 1 319 4
is 1 319 4
even 1 319 4
possible), 1 319 4
evidence 0 319 4
has 0 319 4
surfaced 0 319 4
that 0 319 4
indicates 0 319 4
that 0 319 4
a 0 319 4
bishop, 0 319 4
as 0 319 4
well 0 319 4
as 0 319 4
some 0 319 4
priests 0 319 4
and 0 319 4
laity, 0 319 4
had 0 319 4
brought 0 319 4
the 0 319 4
allegations 0 319 4
about 0 319 4
misconduct 0 319 4
with 0 319 4
seminarians 0 319 4
to 0 319 4
the 0 319 4
attention 0 319 4
of 0 319 4
Church 0 319 4
authorities 0 319 4
but 0 319 4
to 0 319 4
no 0 319 4
avail: 0 319 4
Archbishop 0 319 4
McCarrick 0 319 4
was 0 319 4
nonetheless 0 319 4
“promoted” 0 319 4
to 0 319 4
become 0 319 4
the 0 319 4
archbishop 0 319 4
in 0 319 4
our 1 319 4
nation’s 1 319 4
capital, 0 319 4
and 0 319 4
elevated 0 319 4
to 0 319 4
the 0 319 4
College 0 319 4
of 0 319 4
Cardinals. 0 319 4

While 0 319 5
I 0 319 5
realize 0 319 5
that 0 319 5
it 0 319 5
is 0 319 5
not 0 319 5
always 0 319 5
easy 0 319 5
to 0 319 5
evaluate 0 319 5
the 0 319 5
credibility 0 319 5
of 0 319 5
those 0 319 5
bringing 0 319 5
allegations, 0 319 5
and 0 319 5
that 0 319 5
there’s 0 319 5
often 0 319 5
a 0 319 5
tendency 0 319 5
to 0 319 5
believe 0 319 5
those 0 319 5
we 0 319 5
know 0 319 5
over 0 319 5
those 0 319 5
we 0 319 5
don’t, 0 319 5
I 1 319 5
don’t 1 319 5
think 1 319 5
that 1 319 5
the 1 319 5
Church 1 319 5
in 1 319 5
the 1 319 5
United 1 319 5
States 1 319 5
will 1 319 5
rest 1 319 5
— 1 319 5
and 1 319 5
confidence 1 319 5
will 1 319 5
be 1 319 5
restored 1 319 5
— 1 319 5
until 1 319 5
the 1 319 5
matter 1 319 5
is 1 319 5
independently 1 319 5
investigated 1 319 5
and 1 319 5
explained, 1 319 5
and 1 319 5
assurances 1 319 5
are 1 319 5
given 1 319 5
that 1 319 5
there 1 319 5
are 1 319 5
safeguards 1 319 5
in 1 319 5
place 1 319 5
to 1 319 5
make 1 319 5
sure 1 319 5
that 1 319 5
something 1 319 5
like 1 319 5
this 1 319 5
couldn’t 1 319 5
happen 1 319 5
again. 1 319 5

The 0 319 6
matter 0 319 6
has 0 319 6
been 0 319 6
particularly 0 319 6
troubling 0 319 6
to 0 319 6
me 0 319 6
personally 0 319 6
due 0 319 6
to 0 319 6
the 0 319 6
fact 0 319 6
that 0 319 6
I 0 319 6
had 0 319 6
served 0 319 6
in 0 319 6
the 0 319 6
Archdiocese 0 319 6
of 0 319 6
Newark 0 319 6
as 0 319 6
coadjutor 0 319 6
archbishop 0 319 6
from 0 319 6
November 0 319 6
4, 0 319 6
2013, 0 319 6
to 0 319 6
March 0 319 6
25, 0 319 6
2016, 0 319 6
when 0 319 6
I 0 319 6
was 0 319 6
named 0 319 6
archbishop 0 319 6
here. 0 319 6

It 0 319 7
was 0 319 7
while 0 319 7
I 0 319 7
was 0 319 7
in 0 319 7
Newark 0 319 7
that 0 319 7
I 0 319 7
was 0 319 7
introduced 0 319 7
to 0 319 7
then-Cardinal 0 319 7
McCarrick. 0 319 7

A 0 319 8
number 0 319 8
of 0 319 8
good 1 319 8
Catholics 1 319 8
have 0 319 8
written 0 319 8
to 0 319 8
ask 0 319 8
for 0 319 8
a 0 319 8
personal 0 319 8
accounting 0 319 8
on 0 319 8
my 0 319 8
part, 0 319 8
inquiring 0 319 8
whether 0 319 8
I 0 319 8
was 0 319 8
made 0 319 8
aware 0 319 8
in 0 319 8
my 0 319 8
time 0 319 8
in 0 319 8
Newark 0 319 8
of 0 319 8
the 0 319 8
2005 0 319 8
and 0 319 8
2007 0 319 8
settlements 0 319 8
involving 0 319 8
Archbishop 0 319 8
McCarrick, 0 319 8
or 0 319 8
if 0 319 8
I 0 319 8
knew 0 319 8
of 0 319 8
any 0 319 8
allegations 0 319 8
against 0 319 8
him. 0 319 8

I 0 319 9
can 0 319 9
state 0 319 9
unequivocally 0 319 9
that 0 319 9
I 0 319 9
learned 0 319 9
of 0 319 9
those 0 319 9
settlements 0 319 9
only 0 319 9
in 0 319 9
June 0 319 9
of 0 319 9
this 0 319 9
year, 0 319 9
as 0 319 9
news 0 319 9
broke 0 319 9
about 0 319 9
the 0 319 9
unrelated 0 319 9
claim 0 319 9
that 0 319 9
had 0 319 9
been 0 319 9
filed 0 319 9
in 0 319 9
the 0 319 9
Archdiocese 0 319 9
of 0 319 9
New 0 319 9
York. 0 319 9

What 0 319 10
I 0 319 10
know 0 319 10
of 0 319 10
the 0 319 10
settlements 0 319 10
I 0 319 10
know 0 319 10
from 0 319 10
the 0 319 10
newspapers. 0 319 10

When 0 319 11
serving 0 319 11
in 0 319 11
Newark, 0 319 11
I 0 319 11
was 0 319 11
regularly 0 319 11
briefed 0 319 11
on 0 319 11
current 0 319 11
legal 0 319 11
matters 0 319 11
of 0 319 11
all 0 319 11
sorts, 0 319 11
but 0 319 11
not 0 319 11
on 0 319 11
past 0 319 11
legal 0 319 11
matters 0 319 11
(unless 0 319 11
they 0 319 11
were 0 319 11
still 0 319 11
being 0 319 11
discussed 0 319 11
in 0 319 11
the 0 319 11
press). 0 319 11

By 0 319 12
the 0 319 12
time 0 319 12
I 0 319 12
arrived 0 319 12
in 0 319 12
Newark 0 319 12
in 0 319 12
November 0 319 12
2013, 0 319 12
the 1 319 12
2005 1 319 12
and 1 319 12
2007 1 319 12
settlements 1 319 12
were 1 319 12
apparently 1 319 12
considered 1 319 12
ancient 1 319 12
history. 1 319 12

It 0 319 13
would 0 319 13
be 0 319 13
untrue 0 319 13
to 0 319 13
state 0 319 13
that 0 319 13
I 0 319 13
had 0 319 13
never 0 319 13
heard 0 319 13
any 0 319 13
allegations 0 319 13
about 0 319 13
Cardinal 0 319 13
McCarrick. 0 319 13

Years 0 319 14
before 0 319 14
I 0 319 14
ever 0 319 14
lived 0 319 14
in 0 319 14
Newark, 0 319 14
and 0 319 14
never 0 319 14
imagining 0 319 14
that 0 319 14
I 0 319 14
would 0 319 14
be 0 319 14
assigned 0 319 14
there, 0 319 14
I 0 319 14
had 0 319 14
indeed 0 319 14
read 0 319 14
— 0 319 14
as 0 319 14
a 1 319 14
somewhat 1 319 14
geeky 1 319 14
ex-lawyer 1 319 14
— 0 319 14
an 0 319 14
allegation 0 319 14
about 0 319 14
Cardinal 0 319 14
McCarrick 0 319 14
in 0 319 14
the 0 319 14
context 0 319 14
of 0 319 14
a 0 319 14
2005 0 319 14
lawsuit 0 319 14
in 0 319 14
the 0 319 14
Southern 0 319 14
District 0 319 14
of 0 319 14
New 0 319 14
York 0 319 14
against 0 319 14
Archbishop 0 319 14
Myers, 0 319 14
Cardinal 0 319 14
Eagan, 0 319 14
Bishop 0 319 14
Hubbard 0 319 14
and 0 319 14
the 0 319 14
Irish 0 319 14
Christian 0 319 14
Brothers. 0 319 14

While 0 319 15
the 0 319 15
complaint 0 319 15
didn’t 0 319 15
supply 0 319 15
any 0 319 15
details, 0 319 15
the 0 319 15
plaintiff 0 319 15
was 0 319 15
reported 0 319 15
to 0 319 15
have 0 319 15
said 0 319 15
to 0 319 15
a 0 319 15
journalist 0 319 15
that 0 319 15
“Archbishop 0 319 15
McCarrick 0 319 15
would 0 319 15
share 0 319 15
a 0 319 15
bed 0 319 15
with 0 319 15
seminarians 0 319 15
but 0 319 15
not 0 319 15
engage 0 319 15
in 0 319 15
any 0 319 15
activity 0 319 15
with 0 319 15
them.” 0 319 15
The 0 319 15
complaint 0 319 15
would 0 319 15
later 0 319 15
be 0 319 15
formally 0 319 15
amended 0 319 15
to 0 319 15
include 0 319 15
that 0 319 15
allegation. 0 319 15

Knowing, 0 319 16
however, 0 319 16
that 0 319 16
this 0 319 16
lawsuit 0 319 16
was 0 319 16
completely 0 319 16
dismissed 0 319 16
by 0 319 16
the 0 319 16
state 0 319 16
and 0 319 16
federal 0 319 16
courts, 0 319 16
I 0 319 16
never 0 319 16
gave 0 319 16
the 0 319 16
particular 0 319 16
allegation 0 319 16
about 0 319 16
Cardinal 0 319 16
McCarrick 0 319 16
any 0 319 16
credence. 0 319 16

I 0 319 17
can 0 319 17
also 0 319 17
state 0 319 17
without 0 319 17
exception 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
no 0 319 17
one 0 319 17
in 0 319 17
my 0 319 17
years 0 319 17
in 0 319 17
Newark 0 319 17
ever 0 319 17
told 0 319 17
me 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
they 0 319 17
were 0 319 17
improperly 0 319 17
touched 0 319 17
by 0 319 17
Archbishop 0 319 17
McCarrick, 0 319 17
and 0 319 17
no 0 319 17
one 0 319 17
ever 0 319 17
told 0 319 17
me 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
they 0 319 17
had 0 319 17
to 0 319 17
share 0 319 17
a 0 319 17
bed 0 319 17
with 0 319 17
him 0 319 17
or 0 319 17
that 0 319 17
they 0 319 17
had 0 319 17
seen 0 319 17
anyone 0 319 17
share 0 319 17
a 0 319 17
bed 0 319 17
with 0 319 17
him. 0 319 17

I 0 319 18
heard 0 319 18
lots 0 319 18
of 0 319 18
gut-wrenching 1 319 18
stories 1 319 18
in 0 319 18
my 0 319 18
two-and-a-half 0 319 18
years 0 319 18
there, 0 319 18
but 0 319 18
none 0 319 18
of 0 319 18
them 0 319 18
involved 0 319 18
Archbishop 0 319 18
McCarrick. 0 319 18

With 0 319 19
St. 0 319 19
John 0 319 19
Paul 0 319 19
II’s 0 319 19

visit, 0 319 19
he 0 319 19
was 0 319 19
remembered 0 319 19
for 0 319 19
“bringing 1 319 19
a 1 319 19
saint 1 319 19
to 1 319 19
Newark,” 1 319 19
not 0 319 19
as 0 319 19
an 1 319 19
abuser 1 319 19
of 1 319 19
seminarians, 1 319 19
minors 1 319 19
or 1 319 19
priests. 1 319 19

When 0 319 20
I 0 319 20
was 0 319 20
installed 0 319 20
here 0 319 20
in 0 319 20
St. 0 319 20
Paul, 0 319 20
he 0 319 20
joined 0 319 20
me 0 319 20
at 0 319 20
lunch 0 319 20
along 0 319 20
with 0 319 20
my 0 319 20
father, 0 319 20
sister, 0 319 20
godmother 0 319 20
and 0 319 20
then 0 319 20
12-year-old 0 319 20
nephew. 0 319 20

I 0 319 21
can 0 319 21
assure 0 319 21
you 0 319 21
that 0 319 21
I 0 319 21
would 0 319 21
never 0 319 21
have 0 319 21
allowed 0 319 21
that 0 319 21
to 0 319 21
happen 0 319 21
if 0 319 21
I 0 319 21
had 0 319 21
any 0 319 21
reason 0 319 21
to 0 319 21
know 0 319 21
or 0 319 21
even 0 319 21
suspect 0 319 21
the 0 319 21
things 0 319 21
that 0 319 21
have 0 319 21
been 0 319 21
reported 0 319 21
in 0 319 21
the 0 319 21
newspapers 0 319 21
this 0 319 21
past 0 319 21
month. 0 319 21

While 0 319 22
the 0 319 22
letters 0 319 22
and 0 319 22
emails 0 319 22
of 0 319 22
recent 0 319 22
days 0 319 22
are 0 319 22
sober 1 319 22
reminders 1 319 22
that 0 319 22
there’s 0 319 22
still 0 319 22
a 0 319 22
long 0 319 22
way 0 319 22
to 0 319 22
go 0 319 22
in 0 319 22
restoring 0 319 22
trust, 0 319 22
I 0 319 22
nonetheless 0 319 22
welcome 0 319 22
the 0 319 22
efforts 0 319 22
to 0 319 22
hold 0 319 22
me 0 319 22
accountable 0 319 22
to 0 319 22
you, 0 319 22
the 0 319 22
faithful 0 319 22
of 0 319 22
this 0 319 22
archdiocese. 0 319 22

The 0 319 23
events 0 319 23
of 0 319 23
these 0 319 23
past 0 319 23
weeks 0 319 23
have 0 319 23
shown 0 319 23
that 0 319 23
no 1 319 23
one 1 319 23
can 1 319 23
be 1 319 23
above 1 319 23
the 1 319 23
law, 1 319 23
regardless 1 319 23
of 1 319 23
rank 1 319 23
or 1 319 23
privilege. 1 319 23

I 0 319 24
was 0 319 24
grateful 0 319 24
for 0 319 24
the 0 319 24
opportunity 0 319 24
to 0 319 24
reinforce 0 319 24
that 0 319 24

our 0 319 24
seminarians 0 319 24
this 0 319 24
past 0 319 24
weekend, 0 319 24
and 0 319 24
I 0 319 24
look 0 319 24
forward 0 319 24
to 0 319 24
continuing 0 319 24
my 0 319 24
work 0 319 24

no 0 319 24

forth 0 319 24
an 0 319 24

Our 0 319 25
heavenly 1 319 25
patron, 1 319 25
St. 0 319 25
Paul, 0 319 25
reminds 0 319 25

May 0 319 25
these 0 319 25

REMNANT 0 319 26
COMMENT: 0 319 26
While 0 319 26
we 0 319 26
certainly 0 319 26
appreciate 0 319 26
His 0 319 26
Excellency's 0 319 26
candid 1 319 26
explanation 1 319 26
of 0 319 26
what 0 319 26
he 0 319 26
knew 0 319 26
and 0 319 26
did 0 319 26
not 0 319 26
know 0 319 26
about 0 319 26
this 0 319 26
horrific 1 319 26
scandal 1 319 26
in 0 319 26
the 0 319 26
Church, 0 319 26
we 1 319 26
would 1 319 26
also 1 319 26
humbly 1 319 26
beg 1 319 26
him 1 319 26
to 1 319 26
take 1 319 26
it 1 319 26
one 1 319 26
step 1 319 26
further 1 319 26
by 1 319 26
publicly 1 319 26
proclaiming 1 319 26
his 1 319 26
profession 1 319 26
of 1 319 26
belief 1 319 26
in 1 319 26
the 1 319 26
Church's 1 319 26
official 1 319 26
teaching 1 319 26
against 1 319 26
the 1 319 26
mortal 1 319 26
sin 1 319 26
of 1 319 26
homosexual 1 319 26
acts 1 319 26
and 1 319 26
the 1 319 26
so-called 1 319 26
"gay 1 319 26
lifestyle," 1 319 26
which 1 319 26
includes 1 319 26
her 1 319 26
long-held 1 319 26
teaching 1 319 26
that 1 319 26
homosexual 1 319 26
activity 1 319 26
between 1 319 26
clerics 1 319 26
is 1 319 26
an 1 319 26
ecclesiastical 1 319 26
crime. 1 319 26

Far 0 319 27
from 0 319 27
being 0 319 27
reassured 0 319 27
of 0 319 27
this 0 319 27
by 0 319 27
their 0 319 27
bishops, 0 319 27
many 0 319 27
Catholic 0 319 27
faithful 0 319 27
today 0 319 27
are 0 319 27
informed 0 319 27
that 0 319 27
the 0 319 27
modern 0 319 27
Catholic 0 319 27
Church 0 319 27
is 0 319 27
now 0 319 27
an 1 319 27
"inclusive 1 319 27
community" 1 319 27
that 1 319 27
"welcomes 1 319 27
all" 1 319 27
and 1 319 27
"judges 1 319 27
none." 1 319 27

All 1 319 28
very 1 319 28
well 1 319 28
and 1 319 28
good, 1 319 28
except 1 319 28
for 1 319 28
the 1 319 28
fact 1 319 28
that 1 319 28
the 1 319 28
Church's 1 319 28
constant 1 319 28
and 1 319 28
unchanging 1 319 28
moral 1 319 28
teaching 1 319 28
on 1 319 28
this 1 319 28
makes 1 319 28
no 1 319 28
such 1 319 28
allowance. 1 319 28

In 0 319 29
fact, 0 319 29
this 0 319 29
binding 0 319 29
and 0 319 29
constant 0 319 29
teaching 0 319 29
of 0 319 29
the 0 319 29
Church 0 319 29
was 0 319 29
reaffirmed 0 319 29
most 0 319 29
recently 0 319 29
in 0 319 29
her 0 319 29
most 0 319 29
authoritative 0 319 29
modern 0 319 29
catechism, 0 319 29
which 0 319 29
holds 0 319 29
the 0 319 29
exact 0 319 29
opposite 0 319 29
position 0 319 29
from 0 319 29
that 0 319 29
apparently 0 319 29
held 0 319 29
by 0 319 29
many 0 319 29
bishops: 0 319 29

Homosexuality 0 319 30
refers 0 319 30
to 0 319 30
relations 0 319 30

Basing 1 319 30
itself 1 319 30
on 1 319 30
Sacred 1 319 30
Scripture, 1 319 30
which 1 319 30
presents 1 319 30
homosexual 1 319 30
acts 1 319 30
as 1 319 30
acts 1 319 30
of 1 319 30
grave 1 319 30
depravity, 1 319 30
tradition 1 319 30
has 1 319 30
always 1 319 30
declared 1 319 30
that 1 319 30
"homosexual 1 319 30
acts 1 319 30
are 1 319 30
intrinsically 1 319 30
disordered." 1 319 30

They 1 319 31
are 1 319 31
contrary 1 319 31
to 1 319 31
the 1 319 31
natural 1 319 31
law. 1 319 31

They 1 319 32
close 1 319 32
the 1 319 32
sexual 1 319 32
act 1 319 32
to 1 319 32
the 1 319 32
gift 1 319 32
of 1 319 32
life. 1 319 32

They 1 319 33
do 1 319 33
not 1 319 33
proceed 1 319 33
from 1 319 33
a 1 319 33
genuine 1 319 33
affective 1 319 33
and 1 319 33
sexual 1 319 33
complementarity. 1 319 33

Under 1 319 34
no 1 319 34
circumstances 1 319 34
can 1 319 34
they 1 319 34
be 1 319 34
approved. 1 319 34

Under 1 319 36

in 1 319 36
this 1 319 36

who 1 319 36
apparently 1 319 36

to 1 319 36

“Letter 0 319 37
to 0 319 37
the 0 319 37
Bishops 0 319 37
of 0 319 37

Pastoral 0 319 37
Care 0 319 37
of 0 319 37
Homosexual 0 319 37
Persons”: 0 319 37

Although 0 319 38
the 0 319 38
particular 0 319 38
inclination 0 319 38
of 0 319 38
the 0 319 38
homosexual 0 319 38
person 0 319 38
is 0 319 38
not 0 319 38
a 0 319 38
sin, 0 319 38
it 0 319 38
is 0 319 38
a 0 319 38
more 0 319 38
or 0 319 38
less 0 319 38
strong 0 319 38
tendency 0 319 38
ordered 0 319 38
toward 0 319 38
an 0 319 38
intrinsic 0 319 38
moral 0 319 38
evil; 0 319 38
thus 1 319 38
the 1 319 38
inclination 1 319 38
itself 1 319 38
must 1 319 38
be 1 319 38
seen 1 319 38
as 1 319 38
an 1 319 38
objective 1 319 38
disorder. 1 319 38

Therefore 1 319 39
special 1 319 39
concern 1 319 39
and 1 319 39
pastoral 1 319 39
attention 1 319 39

to 1 319 39
those 1 319 39
who 1 319 39
have 1 319 39
this 1 319 39
condition, 1 319 39
lest 1 319 39
they 1 319 39
be 1 319 39

this 1 319 39
orientation 1 319 39
in 1 319 39
homosexual 1 319 39
activity 1 319 39
is 1 319 39
a 1 319 39
morally 1 319 39
acceptable 1 319 39
option. 1 319 39

It 1 319 40
is 1 319 40
not. 1 319 40

Notice 0 319 41
the 0 319 41

it 0 319 42
is 0 319 42

special 1 319 42
interest 1 319 42
group 1 319 42
that 1 319 42
obviously 1 319 42
doesn't 1 319 42
care 1 319 42
about 1 319 42
her 1 319 42
or 1 319 42

moral 1 319 42
code 1 319 42
by 1 319 42
which 1 319 42

governs? 1 319 42

Does 0 319 43
he 0 319 43
believe 0 319 43
that 0 319 43
all 0 319 43
Catholics 0 319 43
must 0 319 43
follow 0 319 43
the 0 319 43
rules 0 319 43
of 0 319 43
the 0 319 43
Church 0 319 43
pertaining 0 319 43

Commandment...or 0 319 43
just 0 319 43
the 1 319 43
straight 1 319 43
Catholics? 1 319 43

Does 0 319 44
His 0 319 44
Excellency 0 319 44
believe 0 319 44
that 0 319 44
if 0 319 44
some 0 319 44
homosexual 0 319 44
Catholics 0 319 44
feel 0 319 44
they 0 319 44
need 0 319 44
not 0 319 44
bother 0 319 44
following 0 319 44
the 0 319 44
rules 0 319 44
they 0 319 44
should 0 319 44
be 0 319 44
warmly 0 319 44
welcomed 0 319 44
into 0 319 44
our 0 319 44
"Catholic 0 319 44
Christian" 0 319 44
community 0 319 44
anyway, 0 319 44
even 0 319 44
if 0 319 44
they 0 319 44
are 0 319 44
in 0 319 44
same-sex 0 319 44
unions? 0 319 44

Pope 0 319 45
John 0 319 45
Paul 0 319 45
certainly 0 319 45
didn't 0 319 45
accept 0 319 45
that. 0 319 45

In 0 319 46
his 0 319 46
2005 0 319 46
book 0 319 46
Memory 0 319 46
and 0 319 46
Identity, 0 319 46
John 0 319 46
Paul 0 319 46
referred 0 319 46
to 0 319 46
homosexuality 0 319 46
as 0 319 46
an 1 319 46
“ideology 1 319 46
of 1 319 46
evil,” 1 319 46
insisting 0 319 46
of 0 319 46
so-called 0 319 46
'gay 0 319 46
marriage' 0 319 46
that: 0 319 46

“It 0 319 47
is 0 319 47
legitimate 0 319 47
and 0 319 47
necessary 0 319 47
to 0 319 47
ask 0 319 47
oneself 0 319 47
if 0 319 47
this 0 319 47
is 0 319 47
not 0 319 47
perhaps 0 319 47
part 0 319 47
of 0 319 47
a 1 319 47
new 1 319 47
ideology 1 319 47
of 1 319 47
evil, 1 319 47
perhaps 0 319 47
more 1 319 47
insidious 1 319 47
and 0 319 47
hidden, 0 319 47
which 0 319 47
attempts 0 319 47
to 1 319 47
pit 1 319 47
human 1 319 47
rights 1 319 47
against 1 319 47
the 1 319 47
family 1 319 47
and 1 319 47
man.” 1 319 47

Was 0 319 48
Pope 1 319 48
John 1 319 48
Paul 1 319 48
THE 1 319 48
GREAT 1 319 48
an 1 319 48
intolerant 1 319 48
homophobe? 1 319 48

Are 1 319 49
Father 1 319 49
Martin 1 319 49
and 1 319 49
his 1 319 49
pals 1 319 49
in 1 319 49
the 1 319 49
episcopacy 1 319 49
really 1 319 49
so 1 319 49
enlightened 1 319 49
over 1 319 49
every 1 319 49
pope, 1 319 49
saint, 1 319 49
and 1 319 49
moral 1 319 49
theologian 1 319 49
in 1 319 49
history? 1 319 49

Or 1 319 50
is 1 319 50
it 1 319 50
not 1 319 50
so 1 319 50
that 1 319 50
it 1 319 50
is 1 319 50
both 1 319 50
negligent 1 319 50
and 1 319 50
uncharitable 1 319 50
for 1 319 50
some 1 319 50
bishops 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
refuse 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
inform 1 319 50
their 1 319 50
faithful 1 319 50
that 1 319 50
according 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
the 1 319 50
Church's 1 319 50
own 1 319 50
infallible 1 319 50
teaching, 1 319 50
everlasting 1 319 50
damnation 1 319 50
is 1 319 50
the 1 319 50
price 1 319 50
to 1 319 50
be 1 319 50
paid 1 319 50
for 1 319 50
this 1 319 50
kind 1 319 50
of 1 319 50
inclusivity 1 319 50
and 1 319 50
toleration? 1 319 50

And 0 319 51
if 0 319 51
the 0 319 51
episcopal 0 319 51
retort 0 319 51
is 0 319 51
going 0 319 51
to 0 319 51
be 0 319 51
that 0 319 51
this 0 319 51
acceptance 0 319 51
refers 0 319 51
only 0 319 51
to 0 319 51
chaste 0 319 51
homosexuals, 0 319 51
then 0 319 51
we 1 319 51
call 1 319 51
FOUL 1 319 51
even 1 319 51
louder 1 319 51
since 0 319 51
this 0 319 51
crosses 0 319 51
the 0 319 51
line 0 319 51
into 0 319 51
willful 1 319 51
deception. 1 319 51

We're 1 319 52
all 1 319 52
sinners, 1 319 52
of 1 319 52
course--- 1 319 52
and 0 319 52
the 0 319 52
Church 0 319 52
already 0 319 52
accepts 0 319 52
repentant 0 319 52
homosexuals 0 319 52
as 0 319 52
they 0 319 52
are, 0 319 52
just 0 319 52
as 0 319 52
she 0 319 52
accepts 0 319 52
repentant 0 319 52
practitioners 0 319 52
of 0 319 52
ANY 1 319 52
sins 1 319 52
of 1 319 52
the 1 319 52
flesh. 1 319 52

So 1 319 53
why 1 319 53
are 1 319 53
our 1 319 53
bishops 1 319 53
playing 1 319 53
dumb? 1 319 53

Quite 1 319 54
obviously, 1 319 54
it 1 319 54
is 1 319 54
because 1 319 54
what 1 319 54
they 1 319 54
are 1 319 54
actually 1 319 54
closing 1 319 54
an 1 319 54
episcopal 1 319 54
eye 1 319 54
to 1 319 54
are 1 319 54
the 1 319 54
folks 1 319 54
who 1 319 54
want 1 319 54
to 1 319 54
keep 1 319 54
right 1 319 54
on 1 319 54
sinning--and 1 319 54
sinning 1 319 54
proudly. 1 319 54

This 1 319 55
is 1 319 55
what 1 319 55
the 1 319 55
Church 1 319 55
of 1 319 55
Accompaniment 1 319 55
is 1 319 55
all 1 319 55
about! 1 319 55

But, 0 319 56
practically 0 319 56
speaking--in 0 319 56
the 0 319 56
real 0 319 56
world--this 0 319 56
kind 0 319 56
of 0 319 56
"accompaniment" 0 319 56
is 0 319 56
only 0 319 56
green-lighting 1 319 56
vice 1 319 56
and 1 319 56
mortal 1 319 56
sin, 1 319 56
and 0 319 56
as 0 319 56
such 0 319 56
constitutes 0 319 56
a 1 319 56
hideous 1 319 56
violation 1 319 56
of 1 319 56
everything 1 319 56
these 1 319 56
bishops 1 319 56
supposedly 1 319 56
believe 1 319 56
as 1 319 56
Catholic 1 319 56
priests. 1 319 56

So 0 319 57
what's 0 319 57
going 0 319 57
on 0 319 57
here? 0 319 57

Who 1 319 58
are 1 319 58
these 1 319 58
bishops 1 319 58
that 1 319 58
think 1 319 58
they 1 319 58
can 1 319 58
play 1 319 58
fast 1 319 58
and 1 319 58
loose 1 319 58
not 1 319 58
only 1 319 58
with 1 319 58
the 1 319 58
moral 1 319 58
theology 1 319 58
of 1 319 58
the 1 319 58
Catholic 1 319 58
Church, 1 319 58
but 1 319 58
also 1 319 58
with 1 319 58
the 1 319 58
immortal 1 319 58
souls 1 319 58
of 1 319 58
their 1 319 58
flock? 1 319 58

Is 1 319 59
it 1 319 59
any 1 319 59
wonder 1 319 59
that 1 319 59
priests 1 319 59
and 1 319 59
laity 1 319 59
alike 1 319 59
are 1 319 59
changing 1 319 59
their 1 319 59
attitude 1 319 59
on 1 319 59
the 1 319 59
"gay 1 319 59
lifestyle" 1 319 59
and 1 319 59
violations 1 319 59
of 1 319 59
the 1 319 59
Sixth 1 319 59
Commandment 1 319 59
when 1 319 59
so 1 319 59
many 1 319 59
bishops 1 319 59
are 1 319 59
working 1 319 59
to 1 319 59
remove 1 319 59
the 1 319 59
stigma 1 319 59
attached 1 319 59
to 1 319 59
this 1 319 59
sin 1 319 59
that 1 319 59
Scripture 1 319 59
tells 1 319 59
us 1 319 59
cries 1 319 59
to 1 319 59
heaven 1 319 59
for 1 319 59
vengeance? 1 319 59

The 1 319 60
Catholic 1 319 60
Church's 1 319 60
new-found 1 319 60
"climate 1 319 60
of 1 319 60
tolerance" 1 319 60
is 1 319 60
exactly 1 319 60
what 1 319 60
McCarrick 1 319 60
and 1 319 60
company 1 319 60
are 1 319 60
counting 1 319 60
on! 1 319 60

It 1 319 61
is 1 319 61
truly 1 319 61
homophobic 1 319 61
for 1 319 61
any 1 319 61
bishop 1 319 61
to 1 319 61
lie 1 319 61
to 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
gay 1 319 61
community 1 319 61
about 1 319 61
this, 1 319 61
and 1 319 61
to 1 319 61
risk 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
immortal 1 319 61
souls 1 319 61
of 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
sheep 1 319 61
merely 1 319 61
so 1 319 61
that 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
shepherd 1 319 61
might 1 319 61
pride 1 319 61
himself 1 319 61
on 1 319 61
occupying 1 319 61
the 1 319 61
politically 1 319 61
correct 1 319 61
high 1 319 61
ground. 1 319 61

This 1 319 62
is 1 319 62
gross 1 319 62
dereliction 1 319 62
of 1 319 62
duty, 1 319 62
and 1 319 62
we 1 319 62
hope 1 319 62
and 1 319 62
pray 1 319 62
that 1 319 62
all 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
good 1 319 62
U.S. 1 319 62
bishops 1 319 62
would 1 319 62
jump 1 319 62
at 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
opportunity 1 319 62
to 1 319 62
issue 1 319 62
statements 1 319 62
reaffirming 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
Church's 1 319 62
clear 1 319 62
teaching 1 319 62
against 1 319 62
all 1 319 62
sins 1 319 62
of 1 319 62
the 1 319 62
flesh, 1 319 62
homo- 1 319 62
and 1 319 62
heterosexual. 1 319 62

Again, 0 319 63
God 0 319 63
bless 0 319 63
Archbishop 0 319 63
Hebda 0 319 63
for 0 319 63
this 0 319 63
welcome 0 319 63
statement, 0 319 63
and 0 319 63
may 0 319 63
God 0 319 63
grant 0 319 63
him 0 319 63
the 0 319 63
courage 0 319 63
now 0 319 63
to 0 319 63
finish 0 319 63
the 0 319 63
task 0 319 63
by 0 319 63
publicly 0 319 63
reassuring 0 319 63
the 1 319 63
scandalized 1 319 63
faithful 1 319 63
that 0 319 63
it’s 0 319 63
not 0 319 63
just 0 319 63
abuse 0 319 63
of 0 319 63
minors 0 319 63
or 0 319 63
sexual 0 319 63
harassment 0 319 63
that’s 0 319 63
going 0 319 63
on 0 319 63
here. 0 319 63

Our 1 319 64
bishops 1 319 64
must 1 319 64
make 1 319 64
it 1 319 64
absolutely 1 319 64
clear 1 319 64
that 1 319 64
the 1 319 64
Church's 1 319 64
moral 1 319 64
theology 1 319 64
on 1 319 64
homosexuality 1 319 64
will 1 319 64
not 1 319 64
and 1 319 64
can 1 319 64
not 1 319 64
be 1 319 64
trumped 1 319 64
by 1 319 64
the 1 319 64
dictates 1 319 64
of 1 319 64
political 1 319 64
correctness. 1 319 64

And 0 319 65
neither 0 319 65
can 0 319 65
God's 0 319 65
law 0 319 65
be 0 319 65
changed 0 319 65
to 0 319 65
accommodate 0 319 65
the 0 319 65
spirit 0 319 65
of 0 319 65
our 0 319 65
“most 0 319 65
enlightened” 0 319 65
age---which 0 319 65
is, 0 319 65
of 0 319 65
course, 0 319 65
an 1 319 65
evil 1 319 65
spirit 1 319 65
that 1 319 65
can 1 319 65
be 1 319 65
driven 1 319 65
out 1 319 65
only 1 319 65
by 1 319 65
prayer 1 319 65
and 1 319 65
fasting. 1 319 65

Until 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
Church 1 319 66
and 1 319 66
her 1 319 66
bishops 1 319 66
get 1 319 66
back 1 319 66
to 1 319 66
reaffirming 1 319 66
traditional 1 319 66
Catholic 1 319 66
teaching 1 319 66
on 1 319 66
human 1 319 66
sexuality 1 319 66
we 1 319 66
can 1 319 66
forget 1 319 66
about 1 319 66
seeing 1 319 66
an 1 319 66
end 1 319 66
to 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
sexual 1 319 66
abuse 1 319 66
crisis 1 319 66
and 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
massive 1 319 66
problem 1 319 66
of 1 319 66
homosexuality 1 319 66
in 1 319 66
the 1 319 66
clergy. 1 319 66

McCarrick 0 319 66

will 0 319 66

become 0 319 66

the 0 319 66

norm, 0 319 66

not 0 319 66

It’s 0 320 1
noteworthy 0 320 1
that 0 320 1
AP 0 320 1

they 0 320 1

some 1 320 2
“war 1 320 2

deceit” 1 320 2
action. 1 320 2

His 0 320 3

eye-to-eye 0 323 2
on 0 323 2
everything, 0 323 2

his 0 323 2

now 0 323 3
this, 0 323 3

defending 0 323 4
the 0 323 4

now 1 323 5

more 1 323 5
hatred! 1 323 5

I 0 323 6

said 0 323 6
previously, 0 323 6
St. 0 323 6
Thomas 0 323 6
Aquinas 0 323 6
said 0 323 6
that 0 323 6
hatred 0 323 6
of 0 323 6
wickedness 0 323 6
actually 0 323 6
belongs 0 323 6
to 0 323 6
the 0 323 6
virtue 0 323 6
of 0 323 6
charity. 0 323 6

As 0 323 7
the 0 323 7
Book 0 323 7
of 0 323 7
Proverbs 0 323 7
says 0 323 7
'My 0 323 7

shall 0 323 7
meditate 0 323 7
truth, 0 323 7
and 0 323 7
my 0 323 7
lips 0 323 7
shall 0 323 7
hate 0 323 7
wickedness 0 323 7
(Prov. 0 323 7

8:7).' 0 323 8

It 1 323 9
is 1 323 9
an 1 323 9
act 1 323 9
of 1 323 9
love 1 323 9
to 1 323 9
hate 1 323 9
sin 1 323 9

statement 1 323 12
of 1 323 12
fidelity 1 323 12
to 1 323 12
the 1 323 12
Church’s 1 323 12
moral 1 323 12
theology, 1 323 12
specifically 1 323 12
her 1 323 12
teaching 1 323 12
against 1 323 12
the 1 323 12
mortal 1 323 12
sin 1 323 12
of 1 323 12
homosexual 1 323 12
acts. 1 323 12

In 0 323 13
so 0 323 13
doing, 0 323 13
the 0 323 13
bishops 0 323 13
will 0 323 13
incur 0 323 13
the 1 323 13
wrath 1 323 13
of 1 323 13
the 1 323 13
enemies 1 323 13
of 1 323 13
the 1 323 13
Church, 1 323 13
yes. 0 323 13

They 1 323 14
will 1 323 14
be 1 323 14
crucified 1 323 14
in 1 323 14
the 1 323 14
media, 1 323 14
yes. 1 323 14

But 1 323 15
they 1 323 15
will 1 323 15
also 1 323 15
be 1 323 15
doing 1 323 15
their 1 323 15
sacred 1 323 15
duty 1 323 15
before 1 323 15
God 1 323 15
in 1 323 15
reassuring 1 323 15
their 1 323 15
thoroughly 1 323 15
scandalized 1 323 15
flocks 1 323 15
that 1 323 15
they 1 323 15
are 1 323 15
absolutely 1 323 15
committed 1 323 15
to 1 323 15
the 1 323 15
defense 1 323 15
and 1 323 15
enforcement 1 323 15
of 1 323 15
the 1 323 15
Church’s 1 323 15
moral 1 323 15
teaching 1 323 15
at 1 323 15
a 1 323 15
time 1 323 15
when 1 323 15
it 1 323 15
is 1 323 15
under 1 323 15
scurrilous 1 323 15
attack 1 323 15
from 1 323 15
within. 1 323 15

Nothing 1 323 16
less 1 323 16
will 1 323 16
do. 1 323 16

Bishop 0 323 17
Morlino 0 323 17
has 0 323 17
now 0 323 17
done 0 323 17
it, 0 323 17
and 0 323 17
we 1 323 17
respectfully 1 323 17
demand 1 323 17
that 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
rest 1 323 17
of 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
American 1 323 17
bishops 1 323 17
either 1 323 17
follow 1 323 17
suit 1 323 17
or 1 323 17
face 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
charge 1 323 17
of 1 323 17
being 1 323 17
complicit 1 323 17
with 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
degenerate 1 323 17
and 1 323 17
even 1 323 17
criminal 1 323 17
shepherds, 1 323 17
accounts 1 323 17
of 1 323 17
whose 1 323 17
betrayal 1 323 17
and 1 323 17
vice 1 323 17
now 1 323 17
dominate 1 323 17
the 1 323 17
news. 1 323 17

May 1 323 18
God 1 323 18
bless 1 323 18
and 1 323 18
keep 1 323 18

2018 0 323 21

Dear 0 323 22
brothers 0 323 22
and 0 323 22
sisters 0 323 22
in 0 323 22
Christ 0 323 22
of 0 323 22
the 0 323 22
Diocese 0 323 22
of 0 323 22
Madison, 0 323 22

The 0 323 23
past 0 323 23
weeks 0 323 23
have 0 323 23
brought 0 323 23
a 0 323 23
great 0 323 23
deal 0 323 23
of 0 323 23
scandal, 0 323 23
justified 0 323 23
anger, 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
a 0 323 23
call 0 323 23
for 0 323 23
answers 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
action 0 323 23
by 0 323 23
many 0 323 23
faithful 0 323 23
Catholics 0 323 23
here 0 323 23
in 0 323 23
the 0 323 23
U.S. 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
overseas, 0 323 23
directed 0 323 23
at 0 323 23
the 0 323 23
Church 0 323 23
hierarchy 0 323 23
regarding 0 323 23
sexual 0 323 23
sins 0 323 23
by 0 323 23
bishops, 0 323 23
priests, 0 323 23
and 0 323 23
even 0 323 23
cardinals. 0 323 23

Still 0 323 24
more 0 323 24
anger 0 323 24
is 0 323 24
rightly 0 323 24
directed 0 323 24
at 0 323 24
those 0 323 24
who 0 323 24
have 0 323 24
been 0 323 24
complicit 0 323 24
in 0 323 24
keeping 0 323 24
some 0 323 24
of 0 323 24
these 0 323 24
serious 0 323 24
sins 0 323 24
from 0 323 24
coming 0 323 24
to 0 323 24
light. 0 323 24

For 0 323 25
my 0 323 25
part 0 323 25
— 0 323 25
and 0 323 25
I 0 323 25
know 0 323 25
I 0 323 25
am 0 323 25
not 0 323 25
alone 0 323 25
— 0 323 25
I 1 323 25
am 1 323 25
tired 1 323 25
of 1 323 25
this. 1 323 25

I 1 323 26
am 1 323 26
tired 1 323 26
of 0 323 26
people 0 323 26
being 0 323 26
hurt, 0 323 26
gravely 1 323 26
hurt! 1 323 26

I 1 323 27
am 1 323 27
tired 1 323 27
of 0 323 27
the 0 323 27
obfuscation 0 323 27
of 0 323 27
truth. 0 323 27

I 1 323 28
am 1 323 28
tired 1 323 28
of 0 323 28
sin. 0 323 28

And, 0 323 29
as 0 323 29
one 0 323 29
who 0 323 29
has 0 323 29
tried 0 323 29
— 0 323 29
despite 0 323 29
my 0 323 29
many 0 323 29
imperfections 0 323 29
— 0 323 29
to 0 323 29
lay 0 323 29
down 0 323 29
my 0 323 29
life 0 323 29
for 0 323 29
Christ 0 323 29
and 0 323 29
His 0 323 29
Church, 0 323 29
I 1 323 29
am 1 323 29
tired 1 323 29
of 0 323 29
the 0 323 29
regular 0 323 29
violation 0 323 29
of 0 323 29
sacred 0 323 29
duties 0 323 29
by 0 323 29
those 1 323 29
entrusted 1 323 29
with 1 323 29
immense 1 323 29
responsibility 1 323 29
from 1 323 29
the 1 323 29
Lord 1 323 29
for 1 323 29
the 1 323 29
care 1 323 29
of 1 323 29
His 1 323 29
people. 1 323 29

The 0 323 30
stories 0 323 30
being 0 323 30
brought 0 323 30
into 0 323 30
light 0 323 30
and 0 323 30
displayed 0 323 30
in 0 323 30
gruesome 1 323 30
detail 1 323 30
with 0 323 30
regard 0 323 30
to 0 323 30
some 0 323 30
priests, 0 323 30
religious, 0 323 30
and 0 323 30
now 0 323 30
even 0 323 30
those 0 323 30
in 0 323 30
places 0 323 30
of 0 323 30
highest 0 323 30
leadership, 0 323 30
are 0 323 30
sickening. 1 323 30

Hearing 0 323 31
even 0 323 31
one 0 323 31
of 0 323 31
these 0 323 31
stories 0 323 31
is, 0 323 31
quite 1 323 31
literally, 1 323 31
enough 1 323 31
to 1 323 31
make 1 323 31
someone 1 323 31
sick. 1 323 31

But 0 323 32
my 0 323 32
own 0 323 32
sickness 1 323 32
at 0 323 32
the 0 323 32
stories 0 323 32
is 0 323 32
quickly 0 323 32
put 0 323 32
into 0 323 32
perspective 0 323 32
when 0 323 32
I 0 323 32
recall 0 323 32
the 0 323 32
fact 0 323 32
that 0 323 32
many 0 323 32
individuals 0 323 32
have 0 323 32
lived 0 323 32
through 0 323 32
them 0 323 32
for 0 323 32
years. 0 323 32

For 0 323 33
them, 0 323 33
these 0 323 33
are 0 323 33
not 0 323 33
stories, 0 323 33
they 0 323 33
are 0 323 33
indeed 0 323 33
realities. 0 323 33

To 0 323 34
them 0 323 34
I 0 323 34
turn 0 323 34
and 0 323 34
say, 0 323 34
again, 0 323 34
I 0 323 34
am 0 323 34
sorry 0 323 34
for 0 323 34
what 0 323 34
you 0 323 34
have 0 323 34
suffered 0 323 34
and 0 323 34
what 0 323 34
you 0 323 34
continue 0 323 34
to 0 323 34
suffer 0 323 34
in 0 323 34
your 0 323 34
mind 0 323 34
and 0 323 34
in 0 323 34
your 0 323 34
heart. 0 323 34

If 0 323 35
you 0 323 35
have 0 323 35
not 0 323 35
already 0 323 35
done 0 323 35
so, 0 323 35
I 0 323 35
beg 0 323 35
you 0 323 35
to 0 323 35
reach 0 323 35
out, 0 323 35
as 0 323 35
hard 0 323 35
as 0 323 35
that 0 323 35
may 0 323 35
be, 0 323 35
and 0 323 35
seek 0 323 35
help 0 323 35
to 0 323 35
begin 0 323 35
to 0 323 35
heal. 0 323 35

Also, 0 323 36
if 0 323 36
you’ve 0 323 36
been 0 323 36
hurt 0 323 36
by 0 323 36
a 0 323 36
priest 0 323 36
of 0 323 36
our 0 323 36
diocese, 0 323 36
I 0 323 36
encourage 0 323 36
you 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
come 0 323 36
forward, 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
make 0 323 36
a 0 323 36
report 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
law 0 323 36
enforcement 0 323 36
and 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
our 0 323 36
Victim’s 0 323 36
Assistance 0 323 36
Coordinator, 0 323 36
so 0 323 36
that 0 323 36
we 0 323 36
might 0 323 36
begin, 0 323 36
with 0 323 36
you 0 323 36
as 0 323 36
an 0 323 36
individual, 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
try 0 323 36
and 0 323 36
set 0 323 36
things 0 323 36
right 0 323 36
to 0 323 36
the 0 323 36
greatest 0 323 36
extent 0 323 36
possible. 0 323 36

There 0 323 37
is 0 323 37
nothing 0 323 37
about 0 323 37
these 0 323 37
stories 0 323 37
that 0 323 37
is 0 323 37
okay. 0 323 37

These 1 323 38
actions, 1 323 38
committed 1 323 38
by 1 323 38
more 1 323 38
than 1 323 38
a 1 323 38
few, 1 323 38
can 1 323 38
only 1 323 38
be 1 323 38
classified 1 323 38
as 1 323 38
evil, 1 323 38
evil 1 323 38
that 1 323 38
cries 1 323 38
out 1 323 38
for 1 323 38
justice 1 323 38
and 1 323 38
sin 1 323 38
that 1 323 38
must 1 323 38
be 1 323 38
cast 1 323 38
out 1 323 38
from 1 323 38
our 1 323 38
Church. 1 323 38

Faced 0 323 39
with 0 323 39
stories 0 323 39
of 0 323 39
the 0 323 39
depravity 0 323 39
of 0 323 39
sinners 0 323 39
within 0 323 39
the 0 323 39
Church, 0 323 39
I 0 323 39
have 0 323 39
been 0 323 39
tempted 0 323 39
to 0 323 39
despair. 0 323 39

And 0 323 40
why? 0 323 40

The 0 323 41
reality 0 323 41
of 0 323 41
sin 0 323 41
— 0 323 41
even 0 323 41
sin 0 323 41
in 0 323 41
the 0 323 41
Church 0 323 41
— 0 323 41
is 0 323 41
nothing 0 323 41
new. 0 323 41

We 0 323 42
are 0 323 42
a 0 323 42
Church 0 323 42
made 0 323 42
of 0 323 42
sinners, 0 323 42
but 0 323 42
we 0 323 42
are 0 323 42
sinners 0 323 42
called 0 323 42
to 0 323 42
sanctity. 0 323 42

So 0 323 43
what 0 323 43
is 0 323 43
new? 0 323 43

What 0 323 44
is 0 323 44
new 0 323 44
is 0 323 44
the 0 323 44
seeming 0 323 44
acceptance 0 323 44
of 0 323 44
sin 0 323 44
by 0 323 44
some 0 323 44
in 0 323 44
the 0 323 44
Church, 0 323 44
and 0 323 44
the 0 323 44
apparent 0 323 44
efforts 0 323 44
to 0 323 44
cover 0 323 44
over 0 323 44
sin 0 323 44
by 0 323 44
them 0 323 44
and 0 323 44
others. 0 323 44

Unless 1 323 45
and 1 323 45
until 1 323 45
we 1 323 45
take 1 323 45
seriously 1 323 45
our 1 323 45
call 1 323 45
to 1 323 45
sanctity, 1 323 45
we, 1 323 45
as 1 323 45
an 1 323 45
institution 1 323 45
and 1 323 45
as 1 323 45
individuals, 1 323 45
will 1 323 45
continue 1 323 45
to 1 323 45
suffer 1 323 45
the 1 323 45
“wages 1 323 45
of 1 323 45
sin.” 1 323 45

For 0 323 46
too 0 323 46
long 0 323 46
we 0 323 46
have 0 323 46
diminished 0 323 46
the 0 323 46
reality 0 323 46
of 0 323 46
sin 0 323 46
— 0 323 46
we 0 323 46
have 0 323 46
refused 0 323 46
to 0 323 46
call 0 323 46
a 0 323 46
sin 0 323 46
a 0 323 46
sin 1 323 46
— 0 323 46
and 0 323 46
we 1 323 46
have 1 323 46
excused 1 323 46
sin 1 323 46
in 1 323 46
the 1 323 46
name 1 323 46
of 1 323 46
a 1 323 46
mistaken 1 323 46
notion 1 323 46
of 1 323 46
mercy. 1 323 46

In 0 323 47
our 0 323 47
efforts 0 323 47
to 0 323 47
be 0 323 47
open 0 323 47
to 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
world 0 323 47
we 0 323 47
have 0 323 47
become 0 323 47
all 0 323 47
too 0 323 47
willing 0 323 47
to 0 323 47
abandon 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
Way, 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
Truth, 0 323 47
and 0 323 47
the 0 323 47
Life. 0 323 47

In 0 323 48
order 0 323 48
to 0 323 48
avoid 0 323 48
causing 0 323 48
offense 0 323 48
we 0 323 48
offer 0 323 48
to 0 323 48
ourselves 0 323 48
and 0 323 48
to 0 323 48
others 0 323 48
niceties 0 323 48
and 0 323 48
human 0 323 48
consolation. 0 323 48

Why 1 323 49
do 1 323 49
we 1 323 49
do 1 323 49
this? 1 323 49

Is 1 323 50
it 1 323 50
out 1 323 50
of 1 323 50
an 1 323 50
earnest 1 323 50
desire 1 323 50
to 1 323 50
display 1 323 50
a 1 323 50
misguided 1 323 50
sense 1 323 50
of 1 323 50
being 1 323 50
“pastoral?” 1 323 50
Have 1 323 50
we 1 323 50
covered 1 323 50
over 1 323 50
the 1 323 50
truth 1 323 50
out 1 323 50
of 1 323 50
fear? 1 323 50

Are 1 323 51
we 1 323 51
afraid 1 323 51
of 1 323 51
being 1 323 51
disliked 1 323 51
by 1 323 51
people 1 323 51
in 1 323 51
this 1 323 51
world? 1 323 51

Or 1 323 52
are 1 323 52
we 1 323 52
afraid 1 323 52
of 1 323 52
being 1 323 52
called 1 323 52
hypocrites 1 323 52
because 1 323 52
we 1 323 52
are 1 323 52
not 1 323 52
striving 1 323 52
tirelessly 1 323 52
for 1 323 52
holiness 1 323 52
in 1 323 52
our 1 323 52
own 1 323 52
lives? 1 323 52

Perhaps 0 323 53
these 0 323 53
are 0 323 53
the 0 323 53
reasons, 0 323 53
but 0 323 53
perhaps 0 323 53
it 0 323 53
is 0 323 53
more 0 323 53
or 0 323 53
less 0 323 53
complex 0 323 53
than 0 323 53
this. 0 323 53

In 1 323 54
the 1 323 54
end, 1 323 54
the 1 323 54
excuses 1 323 54
do 1 323 54
not 1 323 54
matter. 1 323 54

We 1 323 55
must 1 323 55
be 1 323 55
done 1 323 55
with 1 323 55
sin. 1 323 55

It 1 323 56
must 1 323 56
be 1 323 56
rooted 1 323 56
out 1 323 56
and 1 323 56
again 1 323 56
considered 1 323 56
unacceptable. 1 323 56

Love 0 323 57
sinners? 0 323 57

Yes. 0 323 58

Accept 0 323 59
true 0 323 59
repentance? 0 323 59

Yes. 0 323 60

But 0 323 61
do 0 323 61
not 0 323 61
say 0 323 61
sin 0 323 61
is 0 323 61
okay. 0 323 61

And 0 323 62
do 0 323 62
not 0 323 62
pretend 0 323 62
that 0 323 62
grave 0 323 62
violations 0 323 62
of 0 323 62
office 0 323 62
and 0 323 62
of 0 323 62
trust 0 323 62
come 0 323 62
without 0 323 62
grave, 0 323 62
lasting 0 323 62
consequences. 0 323 62

For 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
Church, 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
crisis 0 323 63
we 0 323 63
face 0 323 63
is 0 323 63
not 0 323 63
limited 0 323 63
to 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
McCarrick 0 323 63
affair, 0 323 63
or 0 323 63
the 0 323 63
Pennsylvania 0 323 63
Grand 0 323 63
Jury 0 323 63
Report, 0 323 63
or 0 323 63
anything 0 323 63
else 0 323 63
that 0 323 63
may 0 323 63
come. 0 323 63

The 0 323 64
deeper 0 323 64
crisis 0 323 64
that 0 323 64
must 0 323 64
be 0 323 64
addressed 0 323 64
is 0 323 64
the 1 323 64
license 1 323 64
for 1 323 64
sin 1 323 64
to 1 323 64
have 1 323 64
a 1 323 64
home 1 323 64
in 1 323 64
individuals 1 323 64
at 1 323 64
every 1 323 64
level 1 323 64
of 1 323 64
the 1 323 64
Church. 1 323 64

There 0 323 65
is 0 323 65
a 0 323 65
certain 0 323 65
comfort 0 323 65
level 0 323 65
with 0 323 65
sin 0 323 65
that 0 323 65
has 0 323 65
come 0 323 65
to 0 323 65
pervade 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
teaching, 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
preaching, 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
decision 0 323 65
making, 0 323 65
and 0 323 65
our 0 323 65
very 0 323 65
way 0 323 65
of 0 323 65
living. 0 323 65

If 0 323 66
you’ll 0 323 66
permit 0 323 66
me, 0 323 66
what 1 323 66
the 1 323 66
Church 1 323 66
needs 1 323 66
now 1 323 66
is 1 323 66
more 1 323 66
hatred! 1 323 66

As 0 323 67
I 0 323 67
have 0 323 67
said 0 323 67
previously, 0 323 67
St. 0 323 67
Thomas 0 323 67
Aquinas 0 323 67
said 0 323 67
that 0 323 67
hatred 0 323 67
of 0 323 67
wickedness 0 323 67
actually 0 323 67
belongs 0 323 67
to 0 323 67
the 0 323 67
virtue 0 323 67
of 0 323 67
charity. 0 323 67

As 0 323 68
the 0 323 68
Book 0 323 68
of 0 323 68
Proverbs 0 323 68
says 0 323 68
“My 0 323 68
mouth 0 323 68
shall 0 323 68
meditate 0 323 68
truth, 0 323 68
and 0 323 68
my 0 323 68
lips 0 323 68
shall 0 323 68
hate 0 323 68
wickedness 0 323 68
(Prov. 0 323 68

8:7).” 0 323 69
It 1 323 69
is 1 323 69
an 1 323 69
act 1 323 69
of 1 323 69
love 1 323 69
to 1 323 69
hate 1 323 69
sin 1 323 69
and 1 323 69
to 1 323 69
call 1 323 69
others 1 323 69
to 1 323 69
turn 1 323 69
away 1 323 69
from 1 323 69
sin. 1 323 69

There 0 323 70
must 0 323 70
be 0 323 70
no 0 323 70
room 0 323 70
left, 0 323 70
no 0 323 70
refuge 0 323 70
for 0 323 70
sin 0 323 70
— 0 323 70
either 0 323 70
within 0 323 70
our 0 323 70
own 0 323 70
lives, 0 323 70
or 0 323 70
within 0 323 70
the 0 323 70
lives 0 323 70
of 0 323 70
our 0 323 70
communities. 0 323 70

To 0 323 71
be 0 323 71
a 0 323 71
refuge 0 323 71
for 0 323 71
sinners 0 323 71
(which 0 323 71
we 0 323 71
should 0 323 71
be), 0 323 71
the 0 323 71
Church 0 323 71
must 0 323 71
be 0 323 71
a 0 323 71
place 0 323 71
where 0 323 71
sinners 0 323 71
can 0 323 71
turn 0 323 71
to 0 323 71
be 0 323 71
reconciled. 0 323 71

In 0 323 72
this 0 323 72
I 0 323 72
speak 0 323 72
of 0 323 72
all 0 323 72
sin. 0 323 72

But 0 323 73
to 0 323 73
be 0 323 73
clear, 0 323 73
in 0 323 73
the 0 323 73
specific 0 323 73
situations 0 323 73
at 0 323 73
hand, 0 323 73
we 0 323 73
are 0 323 73
talking 0 323 73
about 0 323 73
deviant 1 323 73
sexual 1 323 73
— 0 323 73
almost 0 323 73
exclusively 0 323 73
homosexual 0 323 73
— 0 323 73
acts 0 323 73
by 0 323 73
clerics. 0 323 73

We’re 0 323 74
also 0 323 74
talking 0 323 74
about 0 323 74
homosexual 0 323 74
propositions 0 323 74
and 0 323 74
abuses 0 323 74
against 0 323 74
seminarians 0 323 74
and 0 323 74
young 0 323 74
priests 0 323 74
by 0 323 74
powerful 1 323 74
priests, 1 323 74
bishops, 1 323 74
and 1 323 74
cardinals. 1 323 74

We 0 323 75
are 0 323 75
talking 0 323 75
about 0 323 75
acts 0 323 75
and 0 323 75
actions 0 323 75
which 0 323 75
are 0 323 75
not 0 323 75
only 0 323 75
in 0 323 75
violation 0 323 75
of 0 323 75
the 0 323 75
sacred 0 323 75
promises 0 323 75
made 0 323 75
by 0 323 75
some, 0 323 75
in 0 323 75
short, 0 323 75
sacrilege, 0 323 75
but 1 323 75
also 1 323 75
are 1 323 75
in 1 323 75
violation 1 323 75
of 1 323 75
the 1 323 75
natural 1 323 75
moral 1 323 75
law 1 323 75
for 1 323 75
all. 1 323 75

To 0 323 76
call 0 323 76
it 0 323 76
anything 0 323 76
else 0 323 76
would 0 323 76
be 0 323 76
deceitful 0 323 76
and 0 323 76
would 0 323 76
only 0 323 76
ignore 0 323 76
the 0 323 76
problem 0 323 76
further. 0 323 76

There 0 323 77
has 0 323 77
been 0 323 77
a 0 323 77
great 0 323 77
deal 0 323 77
of 0 323 77
effort 0 323 77
to 0 323 77
keep 0 323 77
separate 0 323 77
acts 0 323 77
which 0 323 77
fall 0 323 77
under 0 323 77
the 0 323 77
category 0 323 77
of 0 323 77
now-culturally-acceptable 1 323 77
acts 1 323 77
of 1 323 77
homosexuality 1 323 77
from 0 323 77
the 0 323 77
publically-deplorable 1 323 77
acts 1 323 77
of 1 323 77
pedophilia. 1 323 77

That 0 323 78
is 0 323 78
to 0 323 78
say, 0 323 78
until 0 323 78
recently 0 323 78
the 0 323 78
problems 0 323 78
of 0 323 78
the 0 323 78
Church 0 323 78
have 0 323 78
been 0 323 78
painted 0 323 78
purely 0 323 78
as 0 323 78
problems 0 323 78
of 0 323 78
pedophilia 0 323 78
— 0 323 78
this 0 323 78
despite 0 323 78
clear 0 323 78
evidence 0 323 78
to 0 323 78
the 0 323 78
contrary. 0 323 78

It 0 323 79
is 0 323 79
time 0 323 79
to 0 323 79
be 0 323 79
honest 0 323 79
that 0 323 79
the 0 323 79
problems 0 323 79
are 0 323 79
both 0 323 79
and 0 323 79
they 0 323 79
are 0 323 79
more. 0 323 79

To 0 323 80
fall 0 323 80
into 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
trap 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
parsing 0 323 80
problems 0 323 80
according 0 323 80
to 0 323 80
what 0 323 80
society 0 323 80
might 0 323 80
find 0 323 80
acceptable 0 323 80
or 0 323 80
unacceptable 0 323 80
is 0 323 80
ignoring 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
fact 0 323 80
that 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
Church 0 323 80
has 0 323 80
never 0 323 80
held 0 323 80
ANY 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
it 0 323 80
to 0 323 80
be 0 323 80
acceptable 0 323 80
— 0 323 80
neither 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
abuse 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
children, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
any 0 323 80
use 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
one’s 0 323 80
sexuality 0 323 80
outside 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
marital 0 323 80
relationship, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
sin 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
sodomy, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
entering 0 323 80
of 0 323 80
clerics 0 323 80
into 0 323 80
intimate 0 323 80
sexual 0 323 80
relationships 0 323 80
at 0 323 80
all, 0 323 80
nor 0 323 80
the 0 323 80
abuse 0 323 80
and 0 323 80
coercion 0 323 80
by 0 323 80
those 0 323 80
with 0 323 80
authority. 0 323 80

In 0 323 81
this 0 323 81
last 0 323 81
regard, 0 323 81
special 0 323 81
mention 0 323 81
should 0 323 81
be 0 323 81
made 0 323 81
of 0 323 81
the 1 323 81
most 1 323 81
notorious 1 323 81
and 1 323 81
highest 1 323 81
in 1 323 81
ranking 1 323 81
case, 1 323 81
that 0 323 81
being 0 323 81
the 0 323 81
allegations 0 323 81
of 0 323 81
former-Cardinal 0 323 81
Theodore 0 323 81
McCarrick’s 0 323 81
(oft-rumored, 0 323 81
now 0 323 81
very 0 323 81
public) 0 323 81
sexual 0 323 81
sins, 0 323 81
predation, 0 323 81
and 0 323 81
abuse 0 323 81
of 0 323 81
power. 0 323 81

The 0 323 82
well-documented 0 323 82
details 0 323 82
of 0 323 82
this 0 323 82
case 0 323 82
are 0 323 82
disgraceful 1 323 82
and 0 323 82
seriously 1 323 82
scandalous, 1 323 82
as 0 323 82
is 0 323 82
any 0 323 82
covering 0 323 82
up 0 323 82
of 0 323 82
such 0 323 82
appalling 1 323 82
actions 1 323 82
by 0 323 82
other 0 323 82
Church 0 323 82
leaders 0 323 82
who 0 323 82
knew 0 323 82
about 0 323 82
it 0 323 82
based 0 323 82
on 0 323 82
solid 0 323 82
evidence. 0 323 82

While 0 323 83
recent 0 323 83
credible 0 323 83
accusations 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
child 0 323 83
sexual 0 323 83
abuse 0 323 83
by 0 323 83
Archbishop 0 323 83
McCarrick 0 323 83
have 0 323 83
brought 0 323 83
a 1 323 83
whole 1 323 83
slew 1 323 83
of 1 323 83
issues 1 323 83
to 0 323 83
light, 0 323 83
long-ignored 0 323 83
was 0 323 83
the 0 323 83
issue 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
abuse 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
his 0 323 83
power 0 323 83
for 0 323 83
the 0 323 83
sake 0 323 83
of 0 323 83
homosexual 0 323 83
gratification. 0 323 83

It 0 323 84
is 0 323 84
time 0 323 84
to 0 323 84
admit 0 323 84
that 0 323 84
there 0 323 84
is 0 323 84
a 0 323 84
homosexual 0 323 84
subculture 0 323 84
within 0 323 84
the 0 323 84
hierarchy 0 323 84
of 0 323 84
the 0 323 84
Catholic 0 323 84
Church 0 323 84
that 0 323 84
is 0 323 84
wreaking 1 323 84
great 1 323 84
devastation 1 323 84
in 1 323 84
the 1 323 84
vineyard 1 323 84
of 1 323 84
the 1 323 84
Lord. 1 323 84

The 0 323 85
Church’s 0 323 85
teaching 0 323 85
is 0 323 85
clear 0 323 85
that 0 323 85
the 0 323 85
homosexual 0 323 85
inclination 0 323 85
is 0 323 85
not 0 323 85
in 0 323 85
itself 0 323 85
sinful, 0 323 85
but 0 323 85
it 0 323 85
is 0 323 85
intrinsically 0 323 85
disordered 0 323 85
in 0 323 85
a 0 323 85
way 0 323 85
that 0 323 85
renders 0 323 85
any 0 323 85
man 0 323 85
stably 0 323 85
afflicted 0 323 85
by 0 323 85
it 0 323 85
unfit 0 323 85
to 0 323 85
be 0 323 85
a 0 323 85
priest. 0 323 85

And 0 323 86
the 0 323 86
decision 0 323 86
to 0 323 86
act 0 323 86
upon 0 323 86
this 0 323 86
disordered 0 323 86
inclination 0 323 86
is 0 323 86
a 1 323 86
sin 1 323 86
so 1 323 86
grave 1 323 86
that 1 323 86
it 1 323 86
cries 1 323 86
out 1 323 86
to 1 323 86
heaven 1 323 86
for 1 323 86
vengeance, 1 323 86
especially 0 323 86
when 0 323 86
it 0 323 86
involves 0 323 86
preying 0 323 86
upon 0 323 86
the 0 323 86
young 0 323 86
or 0 323 86
the 0 323 86
vulnerable. 0 323 86

Such 0 323 87
wickedness 1 323 87
should 0 323 87
be 0 323 87
hated 1 323 87
with 1 323 87
a 1 323 87
perfect 1 323 87
hatred. 1 323 87

Christian 0 323 88
charity 0 323 88
itself 0 323 88
demands 0 323 88
that 0 323 88
we 0 323 88
should 0 323 88
hate 0 323 88
wickedness 0 323 88
just 0 323 88
as 0 323 88
we 0 323 88
love 0 323 88
goodness. 0 323 88

But 0 323 89
while 0 323 89
hating 0 323 89
the 0 323 89
sin, 0 323 89
we 0 323 89
must 0 323 89
never 0 323 89
hate 0 323 89
the 0 323 89
sinner, 0 323 89
who 0 323 89
is 0 323 89
called 0 323 89
to 0 323 89
conversion, 0 323 89
penance, 0 323 89
and 0 323 89
renewed 0 323 89
communion 0 323 89
with 0 323 89
Christ 0 323 89
and 0 323 89
His 0 323 89
Church, 0 323 89
through 0 323 89
His 0 323 89
inexhaustible 0 323 89
mercy. 0 323 89

At 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
same 0 323 90
time, 0 323 90
however, 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
love 0 323 90
and 0 323 90
mercy 0 323 90
which 0 323 90
we 0 323 90
are 0 323 90
called 0 323 90
to 0 323 90
have 0 323 90
even 0 323 90
for 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
worst 0 323 90
of 0 323 90
sinners 0 323 90
does 0 323 90
not 0 323 90
exclude 0 323 90
holding 0 323 90
them 0 323 90
accountable 0 323 90
for 0 323 90
their 0 323 90
actions 0 323 90
through 0 323 90
a 0 323 90
punishment 0 323 90
proportionate 0 323 90
to 0 323 90
the 0 323 90
gravity 0 323 90
of 0 323 90
their 0 323 90
offense. 0 323 90

In 0 323 91
fact, 0 323 91
a 0 323 91
just 0 323 91
punishment 0 323 91
is 0 323 91
an 0 323 91
important 0 323 91
work 0 323 91
of 0 323 91
love 0 323 91
and 0 323 91
mercy, 0 323 91
because, 0 323 91
while 0 323 91
it 0 323 91
serves 0 323 91
primarily 0 323 91
as 0 323 91
retribution 0 323 91
for 0 323 91
the 0 323 91
offense 0 323 91
committed, 0 323 91
it 1 323 91
also 1 323 91
offers 1 323 91
the 1 323 91
guilty 1 323 91
party 1 323 91
an 1 323 91
opportunity 1 323 91
to 1 323 91
make 1 323 91
expiation 1 323 91
for 1 323 91
his 1 323 91
sin 1 323 91
in 1 323 91
this 1 323 91
life 1 323 91
(if 1 323 91
he 1 323 91
willingly 1 323 91
accepts 1 323 91
his 1 323 91
punishment), 1 323 91
thus 1 323 91
sparing 1 323 91
him 1 323 91
worse 1 323 91
punishment 1 323 91
in 1 323 91
the 1 323 91
life 1 323 91
to 1 323 91
come. 1 323 91

Motivated, 0 323 92
therefore, 0 323 92
by 0 323 92
love 0 323 92
and 0 323 92
concern 0 323 92
for 0 323 92
souls, 0 323 92
I 0 323 92
stand 0 323 92
with 0 323 92
those 0 323 92
calling 0 323 92
for 0 323 92
justice 0 323 92
to 0 323 92
be 0 323 92
done 0 323 92
upon 0 323 92
the 0 323 92
guilty. 0 323 92

The 0 323 93
sins 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
crimes 0 323 93
of 0 323 93
McCarrick, 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
of 0 323 93
far 0 323 93
too 0 323 93
many 0 323 93
others 0 323 93
in 0 323 93
the 0 323 93
Church, 0 323 93
bring 0 323 93
suspicion 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
mistrust 0 323 93
upon 0 323 93
many 1 323 93
good 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
virtuous 1 323 93
priests, 1 323 93
bishops, 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
cardinals, 1 323 93
and 0 323 93
suspicion 0 323 93
and 0 323 93
mistrust 0 323 93
upon 0 323 93
many 1 323 93
great 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
respectable 1 323 93
seminaries 1 323 93
and 0 323 93
so 1 323 93
many 1 323 93
holy 1 323 93
and 1 323 93
faithful 1 323 93
seminarians. 1 323 93

The 0 323 94
result 0 323 94
of 0 323 94
the 0 323 94
first 0 323 94
instance 0 323 94
of 0 323 94
mistrust 0 323 94
harms 0 323 94
the 0 323 94
Church 0 323 94
and 0 323 94
the 0 323 94
very 0 323 94
good 0 323 94
work 0 323 94
we 0 323 94
do 0 323 94
in 0 323 94
Christ’s 0 323 94
name. 0 323 94

It 0 323 95
causes 0 323 95
others 0 323 95
to 0 323 95
sin 0 323 95
in 0 323 95
their 0 323 95
thoughts, 0 323 95
words, 0 323 95
and 0 323 95
deeds 0 323 95
— 0 323 95
which 0 323 95
is 0 323 95
the 0 323 95
very 0 323 95
definition 0 323 95
of 0 323 95
scandal. 0 323 95

And 0 323 96
the 0 323 96
second 0 323 96
mistrust 0 323 96
harms 0 323 96
the 0 323 96
future 0 323 96
of 0 323 96
the 0 323 96
Church, 0 323 96
since 0 323 96
our 0 323 96
future 0 323 96
priests 0 323 96
are 0 323 96
at 0 323 96
stake. 0 323 96

I 0 323 97
said 0 323 97
that 0 323 97
I 0 323 97
was 0 323 97
tempted 0 323 97
to 0 323 97
despair 0 323 97
in 0 323 97
light 0 323 97
of 0 323 97
all 0 323 97
of 0 323 97
this. 0 323 97

However, 0 323 98
that 0 323 98
temptation 0 323 98
quickly 0 323 98
passed, 0 323 98
thanks 0 323 98
be 0 323 98
to 0 323 98
God. 0 323 98

No 0 323 99
matter 0 323 99
how 0 323 99
large 0 323 99
the 0 323 99
problem, 0 323 99
we 0 323 99
know 0 323 99
that 0 323 99
we 0 323 99
are 0 323 99
called 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
go 0 323 99
forward 0 323 99
in 0 323 99
faith, 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
rely 0 323 99
upon 0 323 99
God’s 0 323 99
promises 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
us, 0 323 99
and 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
work 0 323 99
hard 0 323 99
to 0 323 99
make 0 323 99
every 0 323 99
bit 0 323 99
of 0 323 99
difference 0 323 99
we 0 323 99
can, 0 323 99
within 0 323 99
our 0 323 99
spheres 0 323 99
of 0 323 99
influence. 0 323 99

I 0 323 100
have 0 323 100
recently 0 323 100
had 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
opportunity 0 323 100
to 0 323 100
talk 0 323 100
directly 0 323 100
with 0 323 100
our 0 323 100
seminarians 0 323 100
about 0 323 100
these 0 323 100
very 0 323 100
pressing 0 323 100
matters, 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
I 0 323 100
have 0 323 100
begun 0 323 100
to, 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
will 0 323 100
continue 0 323 100
to, 0 323 100
talk 0 323 100
with 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
priests 0 323 100
of 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
diocese, 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
well 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
the 0 323 100
faithful, 0 323 100
in 0 323 100
person 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
through 0 323 100
my 0 323 100
weekly 0 323 100
column 0 323 100
and 0 323 100
homilies, 0 323 100
making 0 323 100
things 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
clear 0 323 100
as 0 323 100
I 0 323 100
can, 0 323 100
from 0 323 100
my 0 323 100
perspective. 0 323 100

Here 0 323 101
now, 0 323 101
I 0 323 101
offer 0 323 101
a 0 323 101
few 0 323 101
thoughts 0 323 101
to 0 323 101
those 0 323 101
of 0 323 101
my 0 323 101
diocese: 0 323 101

In 0 323 102
the 0 323 102
first 0 323 102
place, 0 323 102
we 0 323 102
must 0 323 102
continue 0 323 102
to 0 323 102
build 0 323 102
upon 0 323 102
the 0 323 102
good 0 323 102
work 0 323 102
which 0 323 102
we 0 323 102
have 0 323 102
accomplished 0 323 102
in 0 323 102
protecting 0 323 102
the 0 323 102
youth 0 323 102
and 0 323 102
vulnerable 0 323 102
of 0 323 102
our 0 323 102
diocese. 0 323 102

This 0 323 103
is 0 323 103
a 0 323 103
work 0 323 103
on 0 323 103
which 0 323 103
we 0 323 103
can 0 323 103
never 0 323 103
rest 0 323 103
in 0 323 103
our 0 323 103
vigilance, 0 323 103
nor 0 323 103
our 0 323 103
efforts 0 323 103
to 0 323 103
improve. 0 323 103

We 0 323 104
must 0 323 104
continue 0 323 104
in 0 323 104
our 0 323 104
work 0 323 104
of 0 323 104
education 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
all 0 323 104
and 0 323 104
hold 0 323 104
to 0 323 104
the 0 323 104
effective 0 323 104
policies 0 323 104
that 0 323 104
have 0 323 104
been 0 323 104
implemented, 0 323 104
requiring 0 323 104
psychological 0 323 104
exams 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
all 0 323 104
candidates 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
ministry, 0 323 104
as 0 323 104
well 0 323 104
as 0 323 104
across-the-board 0 323 104
background 0 323 104
checks 0 323 104
for 0 323 104
anyone 0 323 104
working 0 323 104
with 0 323 104
children 0 323 104
or 0 323 104
vulnerable 0 323 104
individuals. 0 323 104

Here 0 323 105
again, 0 323 105
I 0 323 105
state, 0 323 105
as 0 323 105
we 0 323 105
have 0 323 105
done 0 323 105
consistently, 0 323 105
if 0 323 105
you 0 323 105
have 0 323 105
knowledge 0 323 105
of 0 323 105
any 0 323 105

it 0 323 109
swiftly 1 323 109

To 0 323 112

Most 0 323 112

In 0 323 116
obedience, 0 323 116
strive 0 323 116

a 1 323 116
pure 1 323 116
and 1 323 116
happy 1 323 116
priest 1 323 116
— 0 323 116
as 0 323 116
Christ 0 323 116
Himself 0 323 116
is 0 323 116
calling 0 323 116

And 0 323 117
by 0 323 117

Christ, 0 323 117

God 0 323 118
will 0 323 118
give 0 323 118
you 0 323 118
the 0 323 118
graces 0 323 118
to 0 323 118
do 0 323 118
so. 0 323 118

Ask 0 323 119
Him 0 323 119
for 0 323 119
the 0 323 119
help 0 323 119
you 0 323 119
need 0 323 119
daily 0 323 119
and 0 323 119
throughout 0 323 119
every 0 323 119
day. 0 323 119

And 0 323 120
if 0 323 120
you 0 323 120
are 0 323 120
unchastely 0 323 120
propositioned, 0 323 120

or 0 323 120
if 0 323 120
you 0 323 120
directly 0 323 120

unchaste 0 323 120
behavior, 0 323 120
report 0 323 120
it 0 323 120
to 0 323 120
me. 0 323 120

I 1 323 121
will 1 323 121
not 1 323 121
stand 1 323 121
for 1 323 121
this 1 323 121
in 0 323 121
my 0 323 121
diocese 0 323 121
any 0 323 121

our 0 323 121
seminaries. 0 323 121

To 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
faithful 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
diocese: 0 323 122
If 0 323 122
you 0 323 122
are 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
victim 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
abuse 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
any 0 323 122
kind 0 323 122
by 0 323 122
a 0 323 122
priest, 0 323 122
bishop, 0 323 122
cardinal, 0 323 122
or 0 323 122
any 0 323 122
employee 0 323 122
of 0 323 122
the 0 323 122
Church, 0 323 122
bring 0 323 122
it 0 323 122
forward. 0 323 122

It 0 323 123
will 0 323 123
be 0 323 123
addressed 0 323 123
quickly 0 323 123
and 0 323 123
justly. 0 323 123

If 0 323 124
you 0 323 124
have 0 323 124
directly 0 323 124
witnessed 0 323 124
sexual 0 323 124
advances 0 323 124
or 0 323 124
any 0 323 124
type 0 323 124
of 0 323 124
abuse, 0 323 124
bring 0 323 124
it 0 323 124
forward 0 323 124
as 0 323 124
well. 0 323 124

Such 0 323 125
actions 0 323 125
are 0 323 125
sinful 1 323 125
and 1 323 125
scandalous 1 323 125
and 0 323 125
we 0 323 125
cannot 0 323 125
allow 0 323 125
anyone 0 323 125
to 0 323 125
use 0 323 125
their 0 323 125
position 0 323 125
or 0 323 125
power 0 323 125
to 0 323 125
abuse 0 323 125
another 0 323 125
person. 0 323 125

Again, 0 323 126
in 0 323 126
addition 0 323 126
to 0 323 126
injuring 0 323 126
individuals, 0 323 126
these 0 323 126
actions 0 323 126
injure 1 323 126
the 1 323 126
very 1 323 126
Body 1 323 126
of 1 323 126
Christ, 1 323 126
His 1 323 126
Church. 1 323 126

Furthermore, 0 323 127
I 0 323 127
add 0 323 127
my 0 323 127
name 0 323 127
to 0 323 127
those 0 323 127
calling 0 323 127

real 0 323 127
and 0 323 127
sustained 0 323 127

schools, 0 323 127
universities, 0 323 127
and 0 323 127
seminaries 0 323 127
that 0 323 127
would 0 323 127
root 0 323 127
out 0 323 127
and 0 323 127
hold 0 323 127
accountable 0 323 127
any 0 323 127
would-be 0 323 127
sexual 0 323 127
predator 0 323 127
or 0 323 127
accomplice; 0 323 127

I 0 323 128
will 0 323 128
hold 0 323 128
the 0 323 128
priests 0 323 128
of 0 323 128

life 0 323 128
of 0 323 128

to 0 323 128
you 0 323 128
and 0 323 128
your 0 323 128

and 0 323 128
evidence 0 323 128
of 0 323 128
failure 0 323 128
in 0 323 128
this 0 323 128
regard 0 323 128
will 0 323 128
be 0 323 128
justly 0 323 128
addressed; 0 323 128

I 0 323 129
will 0 323 129
likewise 0 323 129
hold 0 323 129
every 0 323 129
man 0 323 129
studying 0 323 129
for 0 323 129
the 0 323 129
priesthood 0 323 129
for 0 323 129
our 0 323 129
diocese 0 323 129
accountable 0 323 129
to 0 323 129
living 0 323 129
a 0 323 129

celibate 0 323 129
life 0 323 129
as 0 323 129

of 0 323 129
his 0 323 129
formation 0 323 129
for 0 323 129
the 0 323 129
priesthood. 0 323 129

Failure 1 323 130
to 1 323 130
do 1 323 130
so 1 323 130
will 1 323 130
lead 1 323 130
to 1 323 130
dismissal 1 323 130
from 1 323 130
diocesan 1 323 130
sponsorship; 1 323 130

I 0 323 131
will 0 323 131
continue 0 323 131
to 0 323 131
require 0 323 131

be 0 323 131

that 0 323 131

protected 0 323 131
from 0 323 131

I 0 323 134

everyone 0 323 134

Pray 1 323 136

And 0 323 137
pray 1 323 137

yourselves 0 323 137

We 0 323 138

daily 0 323 138
on 0 323 138
our 1 323 138

and 0 323 138
hold 0 323 138
ourselves 0 323 138
accountable 0 323 138
first 0 323 138
and, 0 323 138
in 0 323 138
turn, 0 323 138
hold 0 323 138
our 0 323 138

accountable 0 323 138
as 0 323 138

Finally, 0 323 139
I 0 323 139
ask 0 323 139
you 0 323 139
all 0 323 139
to 0 323 139
join 0 323 139
me 0 323 139

the 0 323 139

private 0 323 139
acts 0 323 139
of 0 323 139

to 0 323 139

committed 0 323 139
by 0 323 139
members 0 323 139
of 0 323 139
the 0 323 139
clergy 0 323 139
and 0 323 139
episcopacy. 0 323 139

I 1 323 140
will 1 323 140
be 1 323 140
offering 1 323 140
a 1 323 140
public 1 323 140
Mass 1 323 140

on 1 323 140

September 1 323 140

the 1 323 140
Triumph 1 323 140

Holy 1 323 140
Name 1 323 140
Heights 1 323 140
and 1 323 140
I 1 323 140
ask 1 323 140
all 1 323 140
pastors 1 323 140
to 1 323 140
do 1 323 140
the 1 323 140
same 1 323 140
in 1 323 140
their 1 323 140
own 1 323 140
parishes. 1 323 140

In 0 323 141
addition, 0 323 141
I 0 323 141
ask 0 323 141
that 0 323 141
all 0 323 141
priests, 0 323 141
clergy, 0 323 141
religious, 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
diocesan 0 323 141
employees 0 323 141
join 0 323 141
me 0 323 141
in 0 323 141
observing 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
upcoming 0 323 141
Autumn 0 323 141
Ember 0 323 141
Days 0 323 141
(Sep. 0 323 141
19, 0 323 141
21, 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
22) 0 323 141
as 0 323 141
days 0 323 141
of 0 323 141
fasting 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
abstinence 0 323 141
in 0 323 141
reparation 0 323 141
for 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
sins 1 323 141
and 1 323 141
outrages 1 323 141
committed 0 323 141
by 0 323 141
members 0 323 141
of 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
clergy 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
episcopacy 0 323 141
and 0 323 141
I 0 323 141
invite 0 323 141
all 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
faithful 0 323 141
to 0 323 141
do 0 323 141
the 0 323 141
same. 0 323 141

Some 0 323 142
sins, 0 323 142
like 0 323 142
some 0 323 142
demons, 0 323 142
can 0 323 142
only 0 323 142
be 0 323 142
driven 0 323 142
out 0 323 142
by 0 323 142
prayer 0 323 142
and 0 323 142
fasting. 0 323 142

This 0 323 143
letter 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
these 0 323 143
statements 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
promises 0 323 143
are 0 323 143
not 0 323 143
intended 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
be 0 323 143
an 0 323 143
exhaustive 0 323 143
list 0 323 143
of 0 323 143
what 0 323 143
we 0 323 143
can 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
need 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
do 0 323 143
in 0 323 143
the 0 323 143
Church 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
begin 0 323 143
to 0 323 143
heal 0 323 143
from, 0 323 143
and 0 323 143
stave 1 323 143
off, 1 323 143
this 1 323 143
deep 1 323 143
illness 1 323 143
in 1 323 143
the 1 323 143
Church, 1 323 143
but 0 323 143
rather 0 323 143
the 0 323 143
next 0 323 143
steps 0 323 143
I 0 323 143
believe 0 323 143
we 0 323 143
can 0 323 143
take 0 323 143
locally. 0 323 143

More 0 323 144
than 0 323 144
anything 0 323 144
else, 0 323 144
we 0 323 144
as 0 323 144
a 0 323 144
Church 0 323 144
must 0 323 144
cease 0 323 144
our 0 323 144
acceptance 0 323 144
of 0 323 144
sin 0 323 144
and 0 323 144
evil. 0 323 144

We 0 323 145
must 0 323 145
cast 1 323 145
out 1 323 145
sin 1 323 145
from 1 323 145
our 1 323 145
own 1 323 145
lives 1 323 145
and 1 323 145
run 1 323 145
toward 1 323 145
holiness. 1 323 145

We 0 323 146
must 0 323 146
refuse 0 323 146
to 0 323 146
be 0 323 146
silent 0 323 146
in 0 323 146
the 0 323 146
face 0 323 146
of 0 323 146
sin 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
evil 0 323 146
in 0 323 146
our 0 323 146
families 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
communities 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
we 0 323 146
must 0 323 146
demand 0 323 146
from 0 323 146
our 0 323 146
pastors 0 323 146
— 0 323 146
myself 0 323 146
included 0 323 146
— 0 323 146
that 0 323 146
they 0 323 146
themselves 0 323 146
are 0 323 146
striving 0 323 146
day 0 323 146
in 0 323 146
and 0 323 146
day 0 323 146
out 0 323 146
for 0 323 146
holiness. 0 323 146

We 0 323 147
must 0 323 147
do 0 323 147
this 0 323 147
always 0 323 147
with 0 323 147
loving 0 323 147
respect 0 323 147
for 0 323 147
individuals 0 323 147
but 0 323 147
with 0 323 147
a 0 323 147
clear 0 323 147
understanding 0 323 147
that 0 323 147
true 0 323 147
love 0 323 147
can 0 323 147
never 0 323 147
exist 0 323 147
without 0 323 147
truth. 0 323 147

Again, 0 323 148
right 0 323 148
now 0 323 148
there 0 323 148
is 0 323 148
a 0 323 148
lot 0 323 148
of 0 323 148
justified 0 323 148
anger 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
passion 0 323 148
coming 0 323 148
from 0 323 148
many 0 323 148
holy 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
faithful 0 323 148
lay 0 323 148
people 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
clerics 0 323 148
across 0 323 148
the 0 323 148
country, 0 323 148
calling 0 323 148
for 0 323 148
real 0 323 148
reform 0 323 148
and 0 323 148
“house 0 323 148
cleaning” 0 323 148
of 0 323 148
this 0 323 148
type 0 323 148
of 0 323 148
depravity. 0 323 148

I 0 323 149
stand 0 323 149
with 0 323 149
them. 0 323 149

I 0 323 150
don’t 0 323 150
know 0 323 150
yet 0 323 150
how 0 323 150
this 0 323 150
will 0 323 150
play 0 323 150
out 0 323 150
nationally 0 323 150
or 0 323 150
internationally. 0 323 150

But 0 323 151
I 0 323 151
do 0 323 151
know 0 323 151
this, 0 323 151
and 0 323 151
I 0 323 151
make 0 323 151
this 0 323 151
my 0 323 151
last 0 323 151
point 0 323 151
and 0 323 151
last 0 323 151

for 0 323 151
the 0 323 151

cooperate 0 325 5
with 0 325 5

But 0 325 6
Trump 0 325 6
on 0 325 6
Monday 0 325 6
morning 0 325 6
tweeted 0 325 6
that 0 325 6

The 0 325 7
length 0 325 7
of 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
Mueller-McGahn 0 325 7
sessions 0 325 7
led 0 325 7

to 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
conclusion 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
special 0 325 7
counsel 0 325 7
is 0 325 7
“looking 1 325 7

because 0 325 7
they 0 325 7

But 0 325 8
Mueller 0 325 8
reportedly 0 325 8
is 0 325 8
keenly 0 325 8
interested 0 325 8

included 0 325 8
a 0 325 8
Russian 0 325 8

The 0 325 9
session 0 325 9
also 0 325 9
was 0 325 9
attended 0 325 9
by 0 325 9

son-in-law 0 325 9
Jared 0 325 9
Kushner; 0 325 9
the 1 325 9
president 1 325 9
dictated 1 325 9
a 1 325 9
misleading 1 325 9
statement 1 325 9
about 1 325 9
it 1 325 9
a 1 325 9
year 1 325 9
later 1 325 9
and 1 325 9
it 1 325 9
remains 1 325 9
murky 1 325 9
just 1 325 9
when 1 325 9
he 1 325 9
learned 1 325 9
about 1 325 9
the 1 325 9
meeting. 1 325 9

As 0 325 10
Roll 0 325 10
Call 0 325 10
has 0 325 10
reported, 0 325 10
Trump 0 325 10
was 0 325 10
in 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
tower 0 325 10
at 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
time 0 325 10
of 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
session 0 325 10
with 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
Russian 0 325 10
lawyer. 0 325 10

The 0 325 11
president 0 325 11
also 0 325 11
continued 0 325 11
to 0 325 11
push 0 325 11
a 0 325 11
line 0 325 11
first 1 325 11
floated 1 325 11
by 0 325 11
his 0 325 11
attorney, 0 325 11
former 0 325 11
New 0 325 11
York 0 325 11
mayor 0 325 11
and 0 325 11
U.S. 0 325 11
attorney 0 325 11
Rudolph 0 325 11
Giuliani, 0 325 11
tweeting 0 325 11
that 0 325 11
campaign 0 325 11
collusion 0 325 11
with 0 325 11
Russia 0 325 11
would 0 325 11
be 0 325 11
a 1 325 11
“phony 1 325 11
crime.” 1 325 11
He’s 0 325 11
right, 0 325 11
there 0 325 11
is 0 325 11
no 0 325 11
specific 0 325 11
collusion 0 325 11
statute. 0 325 11

But 1 325 12
legal 1 325 12
experts 1 325 12
say 1 325 12
anyone 1 325 12
in 1 325 12
Trump’s 1 325 12
orbit 1 325 12
would 1 325 12
be 1 325 12
charged 1 325 12
with 1 325 12
conspiracy, 1 325 12
making 1 325 12
false 1 325 12
statements 1 325 12
to 1 325 12
federal 1 325 12
investigators 1 325 12
or 1 325 12
obstructing 1 325 12
justice. 1 325 12

All 1 325 13
are 1 325 13
federal 1 325 13
crimes. 1 325 13

Trump 1 325 14
also 1 325 14
continued 1 325 14
to 1 325 14
cast 1 325 14
himself 1 325 14
as 1 325 14
a 1 325 14
victim 1 325 14
in 1 325 14
the 1 325 14
matter, 1 325 14
saying 1 325 14
when 1 325 14
he 1 325 14
attempts 1 325 14
to 1 325 14
“FIGHT 1 325 14
BACK 1 325 14
or 1 325 14
say 1 325 14
anything 1 325 14
bad 1 325 14
about 1 325 14
the 1 325 14
Rigged 1 325 14
Witch 1 325 14
Hunt,” 1 325 14
his 1 325 14
critics 1 325 14
“scream 1 325 14
Obstruction!” 1 325 14

Mueller 0 325 15
also 0 325 15
is 0 325 15
looking 0 325 15
at 0 325 15
whether 0 325 15

“It 1 79 6

be 1 79 6
able 1 79 6

sure 1 79 9
what 1 79 9
his 1 79 9

I’m 1 79 9
not 1 79 9
sure 1 79 9
that 1 79 9
a 1 79 9

is 1 79 9
what 1 79 9
survivors 1 79 9
of 1 79 9

want,” 1 79 9
Martin 0 79 9
said 0 79 9
in 0 79 9
a 0 79 9
BBC 0 79 9
interview. 0 79 9

“If 1 79 10
he 1 79 10
expresses 1 79 10
an 1 79 10
apology, 1 79 10
it 1 79 10
needs 1 79 10
to 1 79 10
be 1 79 10
more 1 79 10
than 1 79 10
‘we’re 1 79 10
sorry,’” 1 79 10
he 0 79 10
added. 0 79 10

In 0 79 11
his 0 79 11
letter, 0 79 11
Francis 0 79 11
repeated 0 79 11
a 0 79 11
famous 0 79 11
2005 0 79 11
quote 0 79 11
by 0 79 11
his 0 79 11
predecessor 0 79 11
Benedict 0 79 11
XVI, 0 79 11
who, 0 79 11
a 0 79 11
month 0 79 11
before 0 79 11
being 0 79 11
elected 0 79 11
pope, 0 79 11
lamented 0 79 11
“how 1 79 11
much 1 79 11
filth” 1 79 11
there 0 79 11
was 0 79 11
in 0 79 11
the 0 79 11
Catholic 0 79 11
Church. 0 79 11

“With 1 79 12
shame 1 79 12
and 1 79 12
repentance, 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
acknowledge 1 79 12
as 1 79 12
an 1 79 12
ecclesial 1 79 12
community 1 79 12
that 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
were 1 79 12
not 1 79 12
where 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
should 1 79 12
have 1 79 12
been, 1 79 12
that 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
did 1 79 12
not 1 79 12
act 1 79 12
in 1 79 12
a 1 79 12
timely 1 79 12
manner, 1 79 12
realizing 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
magnitude 1 79 12
and 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
gravity 1 79 12
of 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
damage 1 79 12
done 1 79 12
to 1 79 12
so 1 79 12
many 1 79 12
lives. 1 79 12

We 1 79 13
showed 1 79 13
no 1 79 13
care 1 79 13
for 1 79 13
the 1 79 13
little 1 79 13
ones; 1 79 13
we 1 79 13
abandoned 1 79 13
them,” 1 79 13
Francis 0 79 13
said. 0 79 13

“Looking 0 79 14
back 0 79 14
to 0 79 14
the 0 79 14
past, 0 79 14
no 1 79 14
effort 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
beg 1 79 14
pardon 1 79 14
and 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
seek 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
repair 1 79 14
the 1 79 14
harm 1 79 14
done 1 79 14
will 1 79 14
ever 1 79 14
be 1 79 14
sufficient. 1 79 14

Looking 0 79 15
ahead 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
the 0 79 15
future, 0 79 15
no 0 79 15
effort 0 79 15
must 0 79 15
be 0 79 15
spared 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
create 0 79 15
a 0 79 15
culture 0 79 15
able 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
prevent 0 79 15
such 0 79 15
situations 0 79 15
from 0 79 15
happening, 0 79 15
but 0 79 15
also 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
prevent 0 79 15
the 0 79 15
possibility 0 79 15
of 0 79 15
their 0 79 15
being 0 79 15
covered 0 79 15
up 0 79 15
and 0 79 15
perpetuated,” 0 79 15
he 0 79 15
added. 0 79 15

Colm 0 79 16
O’Gorman, 0 79 16
an 0 79 16
Irish 0 79 16
abuse 0 79 16
survivor 0 79 16
who 0 79 16
founded 0 79 16
One 0 79 16
in 0 79 16
Four, 0 79 16
the 0 79 16
main 0 79 16
survivors’ 0 79 16
group 0 79 16
in 0 79 16
Ireland, 0 79 16
commented 0 79 16
on 0 79 16
Twitter 0 79 16
that 0 79 16
the 0 79 16
pope 0 79 16
offered 0 79 16
“Much 0 79 16
stronger 0 79 16
language 0 79 16
than 0 79 16
ever 0 79 16
used 0 79 16
before.” 0 79 16

But 0 79 17
O’Gorman 0 79 17
added: 0 79 17
“(The 1 79 17
pope) 1 79 17
begs 1 79 17
for 1 79 17
forgiveness, 1 79 17
but 1 79 17
still 1 79 17
does 1 79 17
not 1 79 17
admit 1 79 17
or 1 79 17
own 1 79 17
the 1 79 17
deliberate 1 79 17
policy 1 79 17
of 1 79 17
cover 1 79 17
up 1 79 17
designed 1 79 17
& 1 79 17
implemented 1 79 17
by 1 79 17
the 1 79 17
#Vatican.” 1 79 17

Like 1 79 18
his 1 79 18
predecessor, 1 79 18
Francis 1 79 18
has 1 79 18
promised 1 79 18
“zero 1 79 18
tolerance” 1 79 18
on 1 79 18
child 1 79 18
abuse, 1 79 18
but 1 79 18
scandals 1 79 18
have 1 79 18
kept 1 79 18
recurring 1 79 18
in 1 79 18
several 1 79 18
parts 1 79 18
of 1 79 18
the 1 79 18
world 1 79 18
— 1 79 18
including 1 79 18
in 1 79 18
Australia 1 79 18
recently. 1 79 18

In 0 79 19
January, 0 79 19
the 0 79 19
pope 0 79 19
was 0 79 19
accused 0 79 19
of 0 79 19
insensitivity 0 79 19
and 0 79 19
tone-deafness 0 79 19
after 0 79 19
insisting, 0 79 19
during 0 79 19
a 0 79 19
visit 0 79 19
to 0 79 19
Chile, 0 79 19
that 0 79 19
local 0 79 19
abuse 0 79 19
survivors 0 79 19
had 0 79 19
no 0 79 19
“proof” 0 79 19
against 0 79 19
a 0 79 19
bishop 0 79 19
who 0 79 19
allegedly 0 79 19
witnessed 0 79 19
abuse 0 79 19
and 0 79 19
failed 0 79 19
to 0 79 19
report 0 79 19
it. 0 79 19

Following 0 79 20
an 0 79 20
outcry, 1 79 20
Francis 0 79 20
apologized 0 79 20
for 0 79 20
his 0 79 20
remarks, 0 79 20
held 0 79 20
private 0 79 20
meetings 0 79 20
with 0 79 20
victims 0 79 20
at 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
Vatican, 0 79 20
and, 0 79 20
after 0 79 20
envoys 0 79 20
he 0 79 20
sent 0 79 20
to 0 79 20
Chile 0 79 20
backed 0 79 20
up 0 79 20
victims’ 0 79 20
claims, 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
entire 0 79 20
leadership 0 79 20
of 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
Chilean 0 79 20
Catholic 0 79 20
church 0 79 20

their 0 79 20
resignations. 0 79 20

the 1 79 21

has 1 79 21
a 1 79 21
structural 1 79 21

when 1 79 21

Sessions 0 326 3

Trump, 0 326 5
in 0 326 5
an 0 326 5
interview 0 326 5
that 0 326 5
aired 0 326 5
Thursday 0 326 5
morning, 0 326 5
also 0 326 5
blasted 1 326 5
Sessions 0 326 5
because, 0 326 5
he 0 326 5
said, 0 326 5
the 1 326 5
former 1 326 5
Alabama 1 326 5

the 0 326 8
AG 0 326 8

in 0 326 8
a 0 326 8

Here 0 328 21
is 0 328 21
Abraham’s 0 328 21
account… 0 328 21

“And 0 328 22
the 0 328 22
men 0 328 22
rose 0 328 22
up 0 328 22
from 0 328 22
thence, 0 328 22
and 0 328 22
looked 0 328 22
toward 0 328 22
Sodom: 0 328 22
and 0 328 22
Abraham 0 328 22
went 0 328 22
with 0 328 22
them 0 328 22
to 0 328 22
bring 0 328 22
them 0 328 22
on 0 328 22
the 0 328 22
way. 0 328 22

And 0 328 23
the 0 328 23
Lord 0 328 23
said, 0 328 23
Shall 0 328 23
I 0 328 23
hide 0 328 23
from 0 328 23
Abraham 0 328 23
that 0 328 23
thing 0 328 23
which 0 328 23
I 0 328 23
do; 0 328 23
Seeing 0 328 23
that 0 328 23
Abraham 0 328 23
shall 0 328 23
surely 0 328 23
become 0 328 23
a 0 328 23
great 0 328 23
and 0 328 23
mighty 0 328 23
nation, 0 328 23

the 0 328 23
nations 0 328 23
of 0 328 23
the 0 328 23

For 0 328 24
I 0 328 24
know 0 328 24
him, 0 328 24
that 0 328 24
he 0 328 24
will 0 328 24

after 0 328 24
him, 0 328 24
and 0 328 24
they 0 328 24

keep 0 328 24
the 0 328 24
way 0 328 24
of 0 328 24
the 0 328 24
Lord, 0 328 24
to 0 328 24
do 0 328 24
justice 0 328 24
and 0 328 24
judgment; 0 328 24
that 0 328 24
the 0 328 24
Lord 0 328 24

him. 0 328 24

And 0 328 25
the 0 328 25
Lord 0 328 25
said, 0 328 25
Because 0 328 25
the 0 328 25
cry 0 328 25
of 0 328 25
Sodom 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
Gomorrah 0 328 25
is 0 328 25
great, 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
because 0 328 25
their 0 328 25
sin 0 328 25
is 0 328 25
very 0 328 25
grievous; 0 328 25
I 0 328 25
will 0 328 25
go 0 328 25
down 0 328 25
now, 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
see 0 328 25
whether 0 328 25
they 0 328 25
have 0 328 25
done 0 328 25
altogether 0 328 25
according 0 328 25
to 0 328 25
the 0 328 25
cry 0 328 25
of 0 328 25
it, 0 328 25
which 0 328 25
is 0 328 25
come 0 328 25
unto 0 328 25
me; 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
if 0 328 25
not, 0 328 25
I 0 328 25
will 0 328 25
know. 0 328 25

And 0 328 26
the 0 328 26
men 0 328 26
turned 0 328 26
their 0 328 26
faces 0 328 26
from 0 328 26
thence, 0 328 26
and 0 328 26
went 0 328 26
toward 0 328 26
Sodom: 0 328 26
but 0 328 26
Abraham 0 328 26
stood 0 328 26

before 0 328 26
the 0 328 26
Lord. 0 328 26

And 0 328 27
Abraham 0 328 27
drew 0 328 27
near, 0 328 27
and 0 328 27
said, 0 328 27
Wilt 0 328 27
thou 0 328 27
also 0 328 27
destroy 0 328 27

wilt 0 328 28
thou 0 328 28
also 0 328 28
destroy 0 328 28
and 0 328 28
not 0 328 28

for 0 328 28
the 0 328 28
fifty 0 328 28

righteous 1 328 29
with 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
wicked: 1 328 29
and 0 328 29
that 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
righteous 1 328 29
should 0 328 29
be 0 328 29
as 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
wicked, 1 328 29
that 0 328 29
be 0 328 29
far 0 328 29
from 0 328 29
thee: 0 328 29
Shall 0 328 29

the 0 328 29
Judge 0 328 29
of 0 328 29
all 0 328 29
the 0 328 29
earth 0 328 29
do 0 328 29
right? 0 328 29

And 0 328 30
the 0 328 30
Lord 0 328 30
said, 0 328 30
If 0 328 30
I 0 328 30
find 0 328 30
in 0 328 30
Sodom 0 328 30
fifty 0 328 30
righteous 1 328 30
within 0 328 30
the 0 328 30
city, 0 328 30
then 0 328 30
I 0 328 30
will 0 328 30
spare 0 328 30
all 0 328 30
the 0 328 30
place 0 328 30
for 0 328 30
their 0 328 30
sakes. 0 328 30

And 0 328 31
Abraham 0 328 31
answered 0 328 31
and 0 328 31
said, 0 328 31
Behold 0 328 31
now, 0 328 31
I 0 328 31
have 0 328 31
taken 0 328 31
upon 0 328 31
me 0 328 31
to 0 328 31
speak 0 328 31
unto 0 328 31
the 0 328 31
Lord, 0 328 31
which 0 328 31
am 0 328 31
but 0 328 31
dust 0 328 31
and 0 328 31
ashes: 0 328 31
Peradventure 0 328 31
there 0 328 31
shall 0 328 31
lack 0 328 31
five 0 328 31
of 0 328 31
the 0 328 31
fifty 0 328 31
righteous: 1 328 31
wilt 0 328 31
thou 0 328 31
destroy 0 328 31
all 0 328 31
the 0 328 31
city 0 328 31

lack 0 328 31
of 0 328 31
five? 0 328 31

And 0 328 32
he 0 328 32
said, 0 328 32
If 0 328 32
I 0 328 32
find 0 328 32
there 0 328 32
forty 0 328 32
and 0 328 32
five, 0 328 32
I 0 328 32
will 0 328 32
not 0 328 32
destroy 0 328 32
it. 0 328 32

And 0 328 33
he 0 328 33
spake 0 328 33
unto 0 328 33
him 0 328 33
yet 0 328 33
again, 0 328 33
and 0 328 33
said, 0 328 33
Peradventure 0 328 33
there 0 328 33
shall 0 328 33
be 0 328 33
forty 0 328 33

And 0 328 34
he 0 328 34
said, 0 328 34
I 0 328 34
will 0 328 34
not 0 328 34
do 0 328 34
it 0 328 34
for 0 328 34
forty's 0 328 34
sake. 0 328 34

And 0 328 35
he 0 328 35

unto 0 328 35
him, 0 328 35
Oh 0 328 35

And 0 328 36
he 0 328 36
said, 0 328 36
I 0 328 36
will 0 328 36
not 0 328 36

it, 0 328 36
if 0 328 36
I 0 328 36

And 0 328 37
he 0 328 37
said, 0 328 37
Behold 0 328 37
now, 0 328 37
I 0 328 37

I 0 328 39
will 0 328 39

yet 0 328 39
but 0 328 39
this 0 328 39
once: 0 328 39
Peradventure 0 328 39
ten 0 328 39

visiting 0 328 44

to 0 328 45
stay 0 328 45
at 0 328 45
his 0 328 45

The 0 328 46

agreed. 0 328 46

The 0 328 47

us, 0 328 47
"Before 0 328 47

overthrew 0 328 52
those 0 328 52
cities 0 328 52
and 0 328 52
the 0 328 52
entire 0 328 52
plain, 0 328 52
including 0 328 52
all 0 328 52
those 0 328 52
living 0 328 52
in 0 328 52
the 0 328 52
cities..." 0 328 52
(Genesis 0 328 52
19:2 0 328 52
4) 0 328 52
. 0 328 52

In 0 328 53
light 0 328 53
of 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
passage, 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
most 0 328 53
common 0 328 53
response 0 328 53
to 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
question, 0 328 53
"What 0 328 53
was 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
sin 0 328 53
of 0 328 53
Sodom 0 328 53
and 0 328 53
Gomorrah?" 0 328 53

is 0 328 54
that 0 328 54
it 0 328 54
was 0 328 54
homosexuality. 0 328 54

That 0 328 55
is 0 328 55
how 0 328 55
the 0 328 55
term 0 328 55
”sodomy” 0 328 55
came 0 328 55
to 0 328 55
be 0 328 55
used 0 328 55
to 0 328 55
refer 0 328 55
to 0 328 55
anal 0 328 55
sex 0 328 55
between 0 328 55
two 0 328 55
men, 0 328 55
whether 0 328 55
consensual 0 328 55
or 0 328 55
forced. 0 328 55

Clearly, 0 328 56
homosexuality 0 328 56
was 0 328 56
part 0 328 56
of 0 328 56
the 0 328 56
reason 0 328 56
God 0 328 56
destroyed 0 328 56
the 0 328 56
two 0 328 56
cities. 0 328 56

The 0 328 57
men 0 328 57
of 0 328 57
Sodom 0 328 57
and 0 328 57
Gomorrah 0 328 57
wanted 1 328 57
to 1 328 57
perform 1 328 57
homosexual 1 328 57
gang 1 328 57
rape 1 328 57
on 1 328 57
the 1 328 57
two 1 328 57
angels, 1 328 57
who 0 328 57
were 0 328 57
disguised 0 328 57
as 0 328 57
men. 0 328 57

At 0 328 58
the 0 328 58
same 0 328 58
time, 0 328 58
it 0 328 58
is 0 328 58
not 0 328 58
biblical 0 328 58
to 0 328 58
say 0 328 58
that 0 328 58
homosexuality 0 328 58
was 0 328 58
the 0 328 58
exclusive 0 328 58
reason 0 328 58
why 0 328 58
God 0 328 58
destroyed 0 328 58
Sodom 0 328 58
and 0 328 58
Gomorrah. 0 328 58

The 0 328 59
cities 0 328 59
of 0 328 59
Sodom 0 328 59
and 0 328 59
Gomorrah 0 328 59
were 0 328 59
definitely 0 328 59
not 0 328 59
exclusive 0 328 59
in 0 328 59
terms 0 328 59
of 0 328 59
the 0 328 59
sins 0 328 59
in 0 328 59
which 0 328 59
they 0 328 59
indulged. 0 328 59

Ezekiel 0 328 60
16:49-50 0 328 60
declares, 0 328 60
"Now 0 328 60
this 0 328 60
was 0 328 60
the 0 328 60
sin 0 328 60
of 0 328 60
your 0 328 60
sister 0 328 60
Sodom: 0 328 60
She 1 328 60
and 1 328 60
her 1 328 60
daughters 1 328 60
were 1 328 60
arrogant, 1 328 60
overfed 1 328 60
and 1 328 60
unconcerned; 1 328 60
they 1 328 60
did 1 328 60
not 1 328 60
help 1 328 60
the 1 328 60
poor 1 328 60
and 1 328 60
needy. 1 328 60

They 1 328 61
were 1 328 61
haughty 1 328 61
and 1 328 61
did 1 328 61
detestable 1 328 61
things 1 328 61
before 1 328 61
me..." 0 328 61
The 0 328 61
Hebrew 0 328 61
word 0 328 61
translated 0 328 61
"detestable" 0 328 61
refers 0 328 61
to 0 328 61
something 0 328 61
that 0 328 61
is 0 328 61
morally 1 328 61
disgusting 1 328 61
and 0 328 61
is 0 328 61
the 0 328 61
exact 0 328 61
same 0 328 61
word 0 328 61
used 0 328 61
in 0 328 61
Leviticus 0 328 61
18:22 0 328 61
that 0 328 61
refers 0 328 61
to 0 328 61
homosexuality 0 328 61
as 0 328 61
an 0 328 61
"abomination." 1 328 61

Similarly, 0 328 62
Jude 0 328 62
7 0 328 62
declares, 0 328 62
"...Sodom 0 328 62
and 0 328 62
Gomorrah 0 328 62
and 0 328 62
the 0 328 62
surrounding 0 328 62
towns 0 328 62
gave 1 328 62
themselves 1 328 62
up 1 328 62
to 1 328 62
sexual 1 328 62
immorality 1 328 62
and 1 328 62
perversion." 1 328 62

So, 0 328 63
again, 0 328 63
while 0 328 63
homosexuality 0 328 63
was 0 328 63
not 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
only 0 328 63
sin 0 328 63
in 0 328 63
which 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
cities 0 328 63
of 0 328 63
Sodom 0 328 63
and 0 328 63
Gomorrah 0 328 63
indulged, 0 328 63
it 0 328 63
does 0 328 63
appear 0 328 63
to 0 328 63
be 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
primary 0 328 63
reason 0 328 63
for 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
destruction 0 328 63
of 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
cities. 0 328 63

Those 0 328 64
who 0 328 64
attempt 0 328 64
to 0 328 64
explain 0 328 64
away 0 328 64
the 0 328 64
biblical 0 328 64
condemnations 0 328 64
of 0 328 64
homosexuality 0 328 64
claim 0 328 64
that 0 328 64
the 0 328 64
sin 0 328 64
of 0 328 64
Sodom 0 328 64
and 0 328 64
Gomorrah 0 328 64
was 0 328 64
inhospitality. 0 328 64

The 0 328 65
men 0 328 65
of 0 328 65
Sodom 0 328 65
and 0 328 65
Gomorrah 0 328 65
were 0 328 65
certainly 0 328 65
being 0 328 65
inhospitable. 0 328 65

There 1 328 66
is 1 328 66
probably 1 328 66
nothing 1 328 66
more 1 328 66
inhospitable 1 328 66
than 1 328 66
homosexual 1 328 66
gang 1 328 66
rape. 1 328 66

But 0 328 67
to 0 328 67
say 0 328 67
God 0 328 67
completely 0 328 67
destroyed 0 328 67
two 0 328 67
cities 0 328 67
and 0 328 67
all 0 328 67
their 0 328 67
inhabitants 0 328 67
for 0 328 67
being 0 328 67
inhospitable 0 328 67
clearly 0 328 67
misses 0 328 67
the 0 328 67
point. 0 328 67

While 0 328 68
Sodom 0 328 68
and 0 328 68
Gomorrah 0 328 68
were 0 328 68
guilty 0 328 68
of 0 328 68
many 0 328 68
other 0 328 68
horrendous 1 328 68
sins, 1 328 68
homosexuality 1 328 68
was 1 328 68
the 1 328 68
reason 1 328 68
God 1 328 68
poured 1 328 68
fiery 1 328 68
sulfur 1 328 68
on 1 328 68
the 1 328 68
cities, 1 328 68
completely 1 328 68
destroying 1 328 68
them 1 328 68
and 1 328 68
all 1 328 68
of 1 328 68
their 1 328 68
inhabitants. 1 328 68

To 0 328 69
this 0 328 69
day, 0 328 69
the 0 328 69
area 0 328 69
where 0 328 69
Sodom 0 328 69
and 0 328 69
Gomorrah 0 328 69
were 0 328 69
located 0 328 69
remains 0 328 69
a 0 328 69
desolate 0 328 69
wasteland. 0 328 69

Sodom 1 328 70
and 1 328 70
Gomorrah 1 328 70
serve 1 328 70
as 1 328 70
a 1 328 70
powerful 1 328 70
example 1 328 70
of 1 328 70
how 1 328 70
God 1 328 70
feels 1 328 70
about 1 328 70
sin 1 328 70
in 1 328 70
general, 1 328 70
and 1 328 70
homosexuality 1 328 70
specifically. 1 328 70

The 0 328 71
point 0 328 71
is 0 328 71
that 0 328 71
there 0 328 71
were 0 328 71
no 0 328 71
righteous 1 328 71
to 0 328 71
be 0 328 71
spared 0 328 71
and 0 328 71
the 0 328 71
Lord 0 328 71
did 0 328 71
what 0 328 71
man 0 328 71
failed 0 328 71
to 0 328 71
do 0 328 71
when 0 328 71
they 0 328 71
had 0 328 71
the 0 328 71
time 0 328 71
to 0 328 71
do 0 328 71
it. 0 328 71

Question: 0 328 72
How 1 328 72
do 1 328 72
you 1 328 72
show 1 328 72
mercy 1 328 72
to 1 328 72
a 1 328 72
people 1 328 72
who 1 328 72
observe 1 328 72
lying 1 328 72
vanities 1 328 72
(Jonah 1 328 72
2:4) 1 328 72
and 1 328 72
refuse 1 328 72
to 1 328 72
return 1 328 72
to 1 328 72
the 1 328 72
Lord 1 328 72
(Jeremiah 1 328 72
6:16) 1 328 72
on 1 328 72
His 1 328 72
terms? 1 328 72

(Jeremiah 0 328 73
22:3) 0 328 73
God 0 328 73
must 0 328 73
be 0 328 73
true 0 328 73
and 0 328 73
judgment 0 328 73
must 0 328 73
commence. 0 328 73

Men 0 328 74
today, 0 328 74
like 0 328 74
those 0 328 74
of 0 328 74
Sodom 0 328 74
and 0 328 74
Gomorrah, 0 328 74
are 0 328 74
not 0 328 74
valiant 0 328 74
for 0 328 74
the 0 328 74
truth. 0 328 74

They 0 328 75
are 0 328 75
valiant 0 328 75
to 0 328 75
proceed 0 328 75
from 0 328 75
evil 0 328 75
to 0 328 75
evil 0 328 75
(Jeremiah 0 328 75
5). 0 328 75

They 0 328 76
care 0 328 76
more 0 328 76
about 0 328 76
the 0 328 76
pleasures 0 328 76
of 0 328 76
sin 0 328 76
for 0 328 76
a 0 328 76
season, 0 328 76
than 0 328 76
they 0 328 76
are 0 328 76
grieved 0 328 76
for 0 328 76
the 0 328 76
afflictions 0 328 76
of 0 328 76
Joseph 0 328 76
(Amos 0 328 76
6:6; 0 328 76
Hebrews 0 328 76
11:25). 0 328 76

Men 0 328 77
today 0 328 77
care 0 328 77
more 0 328 77
of 0 328 77
compromise 0 328 77
(where 0 328 77
two 0 328 77
men 0 328 77
both 0 328 77
agree 0 328 77
on 0 328 77
what 0 328 77
they 0 328 77
both 0 328 77
know 0 328 77
is 0 328 77
wrong) 0 328 77
and 0 328 77
diplomacy 0 328 77
(seduction 0 328 77
in 0 328 77
another 0 328 77
guise) 0 328 77
in 0 328 77
promoting 0 328 77
anarchy 0 328 77
through 0 328 77
“antinomianism” 0 328 77
than 0 328 77
they 0 328 77
do 0 328 77
the 0 328 77
Law 0 328 77
of 0 328 77
God 0 328 77
against 0 328 77
the 0 328 77
sins 0 328 77
unto 0 328 77
judgment 0 328 77
that 0 328 77
enslave 0 328 77
men 0 328 77
(John 0 328 77
8:34). 0 328 77

Instead 0 328 78
of 0 328 78
establishing 0 328 78
judgment 0 328 78
within 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
gate 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
hating 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
evil 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
loving 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
good 0 328 78
(Amos 0 328 78
5:15) 0 328 78
in 0 328 78
hopes 0 328 78
that 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
Lord 0 328 78
may 0 328 78
be 0 328 78
gracious 0 328 78
to 0 328 78
their 0 328 78
repentance 0 328 78
(2 0 328 78
Corinthians 0 328 78
7:10), 0 328 78
they 0 328 78
reject 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
counsel 0 328 78
of 0 328 78
God 0 328 78
against 0 328 78
them 0 328 78
by 0 328 78
hating 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
good 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
loving 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
evil, 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
that 0 328 78
to 0 328 78
their 0 328 78
own 0 328 78
damnation. 0 328 78

They 1 328 79
care 1 328 79
more 0 328 79
about 0 328 79
the 0 328 79
approbation 0 328 79
and 0 328 79
favor 0 328 79
of 0 328 79
men 0 328 79
than 0 328 79
they 0 328 79
do 0 328 79
that 0 328 79
of 0 328 79
the 0 328 79
Living 0 328 79
God 0 328 79
and 0 328 79
what 0 328 79
His 0 328 79
Word 0 328 79
declares 0 328 79
(Galatians 0 328 79
1:10),not 0 328 79
knowing 0 328 79
that 0 328 79
which 0 328 79
his 0 328 79
highly 0 328 79
favored 0 328 79
among 0 328 79
men 0 328 79
is 0 328 79
an 0 328 79
abomination 0 328 79
unto 0 328 79
the 0 328 79
Lord 0 328 79
(Luke 0 328 79
16:15). 0 328 79

They 0 328 80
wear 0 328 80
the 0 328 80
cross. 0 328 80

Yet, 0 328 81
they 0 328 81
have 0 328 81
no 0 328 81
testimony 0 328 81
of 0 328 81
the 0 328 81
power 0 328 81
of 0 328 81
God 0 328 81
unto 0 328 81
salvation 0 328 81
by 0 328 81
the 0 328 81
cross 0 328 81
because 0 328 81
they 0 328 81
do 0 328 81
not 0 328 81
practice 0 328 81
what 0 328 81
Christ 0 328 81

Professed 1 328 82
Christians 1 328 82
in 1 328 82
America 1 328 82
today 1 328 82
talk 1 328 82
much 1 328 82
of 1 328 82
love 1 328 82
through 1 328 82
inaction, 1 328 82
and 1 328 82
yet 1 328 82
know 1 328 82
nothing 1 328 82
of 1 328 82
it 1 328 82
(1 1 328 82
John 1 328 82
3:18). 1 328 82

They 1 328 83
read 1 328 83
what 1 328 83
to 1 328 83
do, 1 328 83
but 1 328 83
do 1 328 83
it 1 328 83
not! 1 328 83

In 1 328 84
fact, 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
declare 1 328 84
and 1 328 84
proclaim 1 328 84
how 1 328 84
much 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
love 1 328 84
God, 1 328 84
and 1 328 84
yet 1 328 84
if 1 328 84
you 1 328 84
were 1 328 84
to 1 328 84
have 1 328 84
them 1 328 84
read 1 328 84
His 1 328 84
moral 1 328 84
law 1 328 84
and 1 328 84
look 1 328 84
to 1 328 84
their 1 328 84
own 1 328 84
lives, 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
would 1 328 84
find 1 328 84
how 1 328 84
much 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
actually 1 328 84
hate 1 328 84
God 1 328 84
through 1 328 84
their 1 328 84
actions 1 328 84
(Matthew 1 328 84
15:8). 1 328 84

Then 0 328 85
again, 0 328 85
these 0 328 85
were 0 328 85
the 0 328 85
same 0 328 85
types 0 328 85
of 0 328 85
people 0 328 85
in 0 328 85
Jerusalem 0 328 85
crying 0 328 85
out 0 328 85
"Crucify 0 328 85
him! 0 328 85

Crucify 0 328 86
him! 0 328 86

We 0 328 87

Caesar" 0 328 87
(John 0 328 87

And 0 328 88
these 0 328 88
are 0 328 88
the 0 328 88
same 0 328 88
people 0 328 88
today 0 328 88
persecuting 0 328 88
living 0 328 88
Christians 0 328 88
while 0 328 88
praising 0 328 88
the 0 328 88
dead 0 328 88
ones 0 328 88
(Matthew 0 328 88
5:10). 0 328 88

They 0 328 89
continuously 0 328 89
preach 0 328 89
of 0 328 89
the 0 328 89
heroism 0 328 89
of 0 328 89
Abraham, 0 328 89
Moses, 0 328 89
Joshua, 0 328 89
David, 0 328 89
Gideon, 0 328 89
Samson 0 328 89
and 0 328 89
others 0 328 89
from 0 328 89
the 0 328 89
pulpit 0 328 89
and 0 328 89
fail 0 328 89
to 0 328 89
understand 0 328 89
what 0 328 89
these 0 328 89
men 0 328 89
were 0 328 89
doing 0 328 89
when 0 328 89
serving 0 328 89
their 0 328 89
generations 0 328 89
(Psalm 0 328 89
71:18-19; 0 328 89
Isaiah 0 328 89
51:4). 0 328 89

Today, 0 328 90
instead 0 328 90
of 0 328 90
doing 0 328 90
the 0 328 90
same, 0 328 90
they 0 328 90
simply 0 328 90
hide 0 328 90
under 0 328 90
a 0 328 90
false 0 328 90
grace 0 328 90
(Isaiah 0 328 90
30) 0 328 90
and 0 328 90
give 0 328 90
themselves 0 328 90
over 0 328 90
to 0 328 90
a 0 328 90
man, 0 328 90
the 0 328 90
president, 0 328 90
and 0 328 90
declare 0 328 90
end 0 328 90
times. 0 328 90

They 0 328 91
declare 0 328 91
we're 0 328 91
in 0 328 91
the 0 328 91
end 0 328 91
times 0 328 91
because 0 328 91
they 0 328 91
have 0 328 91
failed 0 328 91
to 0 328 91
stand 0 328 91
up 0 328 91
and 0 328 91
fight 0 328 91
for 0 328 91
their 0 328 91
posterity 0 328 91
in 0 328 91
keeping 0 328 91

His 0 328 91

Ungrateful 1 328 92
reprobates, 1 328 92
pretenders, 1 328 92
counterfeits 1 328 92
and 1 328 92
hypocrites 1 328 92
are 0 328 92
what 0 328 92
they 0 328 92
are 0 328 92
(Matthew 0 328 92
23:3). 0 328 92

of 1 328 93
reaching 1 328 93
out 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
the 1 328 93
greatest 1 328 93
demographic 1 328 93
here 1 328 93
in 1 328 93
America, 1 328 93
public 1 328 93
high 1 328 93
schools, 1 328 93
they 1 328 93
send 1 328 93
missionaries 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
foreign 1 328 93
lands 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
do 1 328 93
there 1 328 93
what 1 328 93
they 1 328 93
fail 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
do 1 328 93
for 1 328 93
their 1 328 93
own 1 328 93
here. 1 328 93

Instead 1 328 94
of 1 328 94
fighting 1 328 94
for 1 328 94
their 1 328 94
posterity 1 328 94
and 1 328 94
shutting 1 328 94
down 1 328 94
the 1 328 94
illegalities 1 328 94
of 1 328 94
sodomy 1 328 94
in 1 328 94
all 1 328 94
50 1 328 94
states, 1 328 94
they 1 328 94
teach 1 328 94
them 1 328 94
to 1 328 94
just 1 328 94
do 1 328 94
their 1 328 94
best 1 328 94
to 1 328 94
understand 1 328 94
that 1 328 94
they 1 328 94
cannot 1 328 94
help 1 328 94
themselves 1 328 94
while 1 328 94
God 1 328 94
say’s 1 328 94
the 1 328 94
opposite 1 328 94
(Leviticus 1 328 94
20:18). 1 328 94

Instead 1 328 95
of 1 328 95
fighting 1 328 95
on 1 328 95
their 1 328 95
behalf 1 328 95
against 1 328 95
the 1 328 95
federal 1 328 95
government 1 328 95
that 1 328 95
is 1 328 95
illegally 1 328 95
indoctrinating 1 328 95
them, 1 328 95
they 1 328 95
simply 1 328 95
give 1 328 95
their 1 328 95
kids 1 328 95
over 1 328 95
to 1 328 95
them 1 328 95
to 1 328 95
be 1 328 95
dumbed 1 328 95
down. 1 328 95

And 1 328 96
instead 1 328 96
of 1 328 96
protesting 1 328 96
the 1 328 96
murder 1 328 96
of 1 328 96
58 1 328 96
million 1 328 96
innocent 1 328 96
babies 1 328 96
(Proverbs 1 328 96
6:17), 1 328 96
they 1 328 96
merely 1 328 96
pass 1 328 96
it 1 328 96
off 1 328 96
as 1 328 96
a 1 328 96
"choice," 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
being 1 328 96
the 1 328 96
lessons 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
they 1 328 96
learned 1 328 96
from 1 328 96
the 1 328 96
media 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
they 1 328 96

do 1 328 96
not 1 328 96
believe 1 328 96
(Romans 1 328 96

The 1 328 97
American 1 328 97
Church, 1 328 97
instead 1 328 97
of 1 328 97
protesting 1 328 97
corruption 1 328 97
in 1 328 97
government 1 328 97
through 1 328 97
the 1 328 97
example 1 328 97
of 1 328 97
the 1 328 97
Biblical 1 328 97
patriarchs 1 328 97
and 1 328 97
our 1 328 97
American 1 328 97
forefathers 1 328 97
(Matthew 1 328 97
5:17-18), 1 328 97
teach 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
submit 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
tyranny 1 328 97
as 1 328 97
if 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
suggest 1 328 97
that 1 328 97
it 1 328 97
is 1 328 97
somehow 1 328 97
obedience 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
God 1 328 97
(Romans 1 328 97
12:21). 1 328 97

The 1 328 98
Church 1 328 98
in 1 328 98
America 1 328 98
has 1 328 98
failed 1 328 98
to 1 328 98
keep 1 328 98
the 1 328 98
Commandments 1 328 98
of 1 328 98
the 1 328 98
God 1 328 98
of 1 328 98
Israel. 1 328 98

Instead 1 328 99
of 1 328 99
preaching 1 328 99
out 1 328 99
against 1 328 99
sin, 1 328 99
they 1 328 99
advocate 1 328 99
for 1 328 99
that 1 328 99
which 1 328 99
God 1 328 99
clearly 1 328 99
condemns, 1 328 99
thereby 1 328 99
making 1 328 99
war 1 328 99
against 1 328 99
God 1 328 99
(Micah 1 328 99
3:5), 1 328 99
which 1 328 99
at 1 328 99
length 1 328 99
destroys 1 328 99
our 1 328 99
government, 1 328 99
our 1 328 99
country 1 328 99
and 1 328 99
our 1 328 99
families. 1 328 99

Look 1 328 100
to 1 328 100
their 1 328 100
feigned 1 328 100
strength 1 328 100
that 1 328 100
they 1 328 100
profess 1 328 100
to 1 328 100
possess. 1 328 100

It 1 328 101
is 1 328 101
gauged 1 328 101
by 1 328 101
simply 1 328 101
looking 1 328 101
to 1 328 101
the 1 328 101
prevailing 1 328 101
immoralities 1 328 101
and 1 328 101
debauchers 1 328 101
of 1 328 101
society. 1 328 101

They 1 328 102
are 1 328 102
weak 1 328 102
and 1 328 102
pathetic 1 328 102
and 1 328 102
they 1 328 102
have 1 328 102
no 1 328 102
excuses 1 328 102
as 1 328 102
to 1 328 102
why 1 328 102
America 1 328 102
is 1 328 102
where 1 328 102
we 1 328 102
is 1 328 102
today! 1 328 102

Why 0 328 103
did 0 328 103
God 0 328 103
judge 0 328 103
Sodom 0 328 103
and 0 328 103
Gomorrah? 0 328 103

It's 1 328 104
the 1 328 104
same 1 328 104
reason 1 328 104
that 1 328 104
he 1 328 104
is 1 328 104
judging 1 328 104
America 1 328 104
today 1 328 104
(Amos 1 328 104
4:12), 1 328 104
He 1 328 104
cannot 1 328 104
find 1 328 104
the 1 328 104
righteous 1 328 104
in 1 328 104
order 1 328 104
to 1 328 104

over 0 328 106

over 0 328 106
again, 0 328 106
they 0 328 106
turn 0 328 106
their 0 328 106

and 0 328 106
choose 0 328 106
the 0 328 106

through 1 328 106
tolerance 1 328 106
and 1 328 106
apathy 1 328 106
Americans 1 328 106

destruction 1 328 106

supernatural 0 330 4
ring 0 330 4
we 0 330 4
usually 0 330 4
reserve 0 330 4
for 0 330 4
dramatic 0 330 4
and 0 330 4
abominable 1 330 4
crimes, 0 330 4
like 0 330 4
genocide. 1 330 4

Yet 1 330 5
everything 1 330 5
right 1 330 5
is 1 330 5
good, 1 330 5
and 1 330 5
everything 1 330 5
wrong 1 330 5
is 1 330 5
evil. 1 330 5

The 0 330 6
evils 0 330 6
we 0 330 6
encounter 0 330 6
in 0 330 6
our 0 330 6
day-to-day 0 330 6
lives 0 330 6
might 0 330 6
not 0 330 6
be 0 330 6
a 0 330 6
spectacle, 0 330 6
like 0 330 6
jihadists 0 330 6
beheading 0 330 6
a 0 330 6
journalist 0 330 6
on 0 330 6
live 0 330 6
television. 0 330 6

All 0 330 7
the 0 330 7
same, 0 330 7
evil 0 330 7
is 0 330 7
part 0 330 7
of 0 330 7
ordinary 0 330 7
life. 0 330 7

It 0 330 8
dwells 0 330 8
deep 0 330 8
in 0 330 8
our 0 330 8
hearts 0 330 8
– 0 330 8
each 0 330 8
and 0 330 8
every 0 330 8
one 0 330 8
of 0 330 8
us. 0 330 8

The 0 330 9
Prince 1 330 9
of 1 330 9
this 1 330 9
World 1 330 9
has 0 330 9
made 0 330 9
a 0 330 9
grand 0 330 9
display 0 330 9
of 0 330 9
his 0 330 9
authority 0 330 9
in 0 330 9
the 0 330 9
last 0 330 9
few 0 330 9
centuries. 0 330 9

Our 0 330 10
saving 0 330 10
grace 0 330 10
is 0 330 10
that, 0 330 10
while 0 330 10
Westerners 0 330 10
no 0 330 10
longer 0 330 10
believe 0 330 10
in 0 330 10
God, 0 330 10
they 0 330 10
still 0 330 10
believe 0 330 10
in 0 330 10
the 0 330 10
Devil. 0 330 10

We’re 0 330 11
at 0 330 11
least 0 330 11
clear-eyed 0 330 11
enough 0 330 11
to 0 330 11
recognize 0 330 11
true 0 330 11
evil 0 330 11
at 0 330 11
work 0 330 11
in 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
world, 0 330 11
even 0 330 11
if 0 330 11
we 0 330 11
can 0 330 11
no 0 330 11
longer 0 330 11
see 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
great 0 330 11
Good 0 330 11
hidden 0 330 11
behind 0 330 11
the 0 330 11
veil. 0 330 11

This 0 330 12
is 0 330 12
the 0 330 12
point 0 330 12
about 0 330 12
the 0 330 12
McCarrick 0 330 12
scandal 0 330 12
that 0 330 12
even 0 330 12
religious 0 330 12
commentators 0 330 12
tend 0 330 12
to 0 330 12
overlook. 0 330 12

How 0 330 13
was 0 330 13
he 0 330 13
allowed 0 330 13
to 0 330 13
go 0 330 13
on 0 330 13
molesting 0 330 13
young 0 330 13
priests 0 330 13
and 0 330 13
seminarians 0 330 13
when 0 330 13
virtually 0 330 13
the 0 330 13
entire 0 330 13
Church 0 330 13
hierarchy 0 330 13
knew 0 330 13
what 0 330 13
he 0 330 13
was 0 330 13
up 0 330 13
to? 0 330 13

And 0 330 14
how 0 330 14
was 0 330 14
such 0 330 14
a 0 330 14
depraved 1 330 14
individual 0 330 14
ordained 0 330 14
in 0 330 14
the 0 330 14
first 0 330 14
place, 0 330 14
let 0 330 14
alone 0 330 14
promoted 0 330 14
to 0 330 14
Cardinal-Archbishop 0 330 14
of 0 330 14
Washington? 0 330 14

The 0 330 15
answer 0 330 15
is, 0 330 15
ultimately, 0 330 15
demonic. 1 330 15

As 0 330 16
Catholics, 0 330 16
we 0 330 16
ask 0 330 16
St. 0 330 16
Michael 0 330 16
to 0 330 16
“cast 0 330 16
into 0 330 16
Hell 0 330 16
Satan 0 330 16
and 0 330 16
all 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
evil 0 330 16
spirits 0 330 16
who 0 330 16
prowl 0 330 16
about 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
world 0 330 16
seeking 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
ruin 0 330 16
of 0 330 16
souls.” 0 330 16
McCarrick 0 330 16
and 0 330 16
his 0 330 16
fellow 0 330 16
perverts 1 330 16
in 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
clergy 0 330 16
are 0 330 16
responsible, 0 330 16
not 0 330 16
only 0 330 16
for 0 330 16
their 0 330 16
sexual 0 330 16
abuses, 0 330 16
but 0 330 16
also 0 330 16
for 0 330 16
chasing 0 330 16
good 0 330 16
men 0 330 16
away 0 330 16
from 0 330 16
the 0 330 16
priesthood. 0 330 16

Spend 0 330 17
enough 0 330 17
time 0 330 17
in 0 330 17
Catholic 0 330 17
World 0 330 17
and 0 330 17
you 0 330 17
inevitably 0 330 17
meet 0 330 17
good 0 330 17
men 0 330 17
who 0 330 17
quit 0 330 17
the 0 330 17
seminary 0 330 17
because 0 330 17
of 0 330 17
some 0 330 17
rampant 1 330 17
(and 0 330 17
often 0 330 17
violent) 0 330 17
depravity. 0 330 17

What 0 330 18
could 0 330 18
suit 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
Devil 0 330 18
more 0 330 18
than 0 330 18
to 0 330 18
watch 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
Church 0 330 18
burn 0 330 18
her 0 330 18
wheat 0 330 18
as 0 330 18
she 0 330 18
gathers 0 330 18
the 0 330 18
chaff? 0 330 18

The 0 330 19
gates 0 330 19
of 0 330 19
Hell 0 330 19
will 0 330 19
not 0 330 19
prevail 0 330 19
against 0 330 19
the 0 330 19
Church, 0 330 19
as 0 330 19
Our 0 330 19
Lord 0 330 19
promised. 0 330 19

But 0 330 20
they 0 330 20
won’t 0 330 20
stop 0 330 20
trying, 0 330 20
either. 0 330 20

They’ve 0 330 21
attacked 0 330 21
from 0 330 21
the 0 330 21
front, 0 330 21
sending 0 330 21
the 0 330 21
Roman 0 330 21
pagans, 0 330 21
French 0 330 21
Revolutionaries, 0 330 21
and 0 330 21
British 0 330 21
American 0 330 21
secularists. 0 330 21

They 0 330 22
flank 0 330 22
us 0 330 22
by 0 330 22
sending 0 330 22
heretics 0 330 22
like 0 330 22
Arius, 0 330 22
Luther, 0 330 22
and 0 330 22
Hans 0 330 22
Kung. 0 330 22

Today, 0 330 23
there’s 0 330 23
also 0 330 23
a 0 330 23
fifth 0 330 23
column 0 330 23
working 0 330 23
to 0 330 23
tear 0 330 23
down 0 330 23
the 0 330 23
walls 0 330 23
from 0 330 23
within 0 330 23
– 0 330 23
not 0 330 23
only 0 330 23
pedophiles 0 330 23
like 0 330 23
John 0 330 23
Geoghan, 0 330 23
but 0 330 23
also 0 330 23
predators 1 330 23
like 0 330 23
Theodore 0 330 23
McCarrick. 0 330 23

Where 0 330 24
did 0 330 24
those 0 330 24
fifth 0 330 24
columnists 0 330 24
enter? 0 330 24

Why, 0 330 25
there’s 1 330 25
only 1 330 25
one 1 330 25
possible 1 330 25
explanation: 1 330 25
the 0 330 25
Second 0 330 25
Vatican 0 330 25
Council. 0 330 25

Aggiornamento 0 330 26
sounds 0 330 26
like 0 330 26
a 0 330 26
Lefebvrist 0 330 26
slur. 0 330 26

The 0 330 27
idea 0 330 27
that 0 330 27
an 0 330 27
ecumenical 0 330 27
council 0 330 27
of 0 330 27
the 0 330 27
Catholic 0 330 27
Church 0 330 27
would 0 330 27
openly 0 330 27
seek 0 330 27
to 0 330 27
“bring 0 330 27
itself 0 330 27
up 0 330 27
to 0 330 27
date” 0 330 27
is 0 330 27
ridiculous. 0 330 27

Yet 0 330 28
that 0 330 28
was 0 330 28
precisely 0 330 28
the 0 330 28
aim. 0 330 28

As 0 330 29
St 0 330 29
Pope 0 330 29
John 0 330 29
XXIII 0 330 29
explained, 0 330 29
“Its 0 330 29
principal 0 330 29
task 0 330 29
will 0 330 29
be 0 330 29
concerned 0 330 29
with 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
conditions 0 330 29
and 0 330 29
modernization 0 330 29
of 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
Church 0 330 29
after 0 330 29
20 0 330 29
centuries 0 330 29
of 0 330 29
life.” 0 330 29
It 0 330 29
was 0 330 29
not 0 330 29
supposed 0 330 29
(as 0 330 29
some 0 330 29
have 0 330 29
claimed) 0 330 29
to 0 330 29
simply 0 330 29
update 0 330 29
the 0 330 29
liturgy 0 330 29
from 0 330 29
its 0 330 29
last 0 330 29
redesign 0 330 29
in 0 330 29
1570. 0 330 29

The 0 330 30
goal 0 330 30
was 0 330 30
to 0 330 30
align 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Church 0 330 30
more 0 330 30
with 0 330 30
modern 0 330 30
world: 0 330 30
a 0 330 30
world 0 330 30
defined, 0 330 30
to 0 330 30
a 0 330 30
considerable 0 330 30
extent, 0 330 30
by 0 330 30
its 0 330 30
rejection 0 330 30
of 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Catholic 0 330 30
world 0 330 30
that 0 330 30
flourished 0 330 30
before 0 330 30
the 0 330 30
Protestant 0 330 30
Reformation 0 330 30
and 0 330 30
French 0 330 30
Revolution. 0 330 30

Now, 0 330 31
I 0 330 31
don’t 0 330 31
believe 0 330 31
Pope 0 330 31
John 0 330 31
saw 0 330 31
himself 0 330 31
as 0 330 31
endangering 0 330 31
either 0 330 31
orthodoxy 0 330 31
or 0 330 31
sacred, 0 330 31
immutable 0 330 31
tradition. 0 330 31

I 0 330 32
share 0 330 32
Pope 0 330 32
Paul 0 330 32
IV’s 0 330 32
view. 0 330 32

When 0 330 33
he 0 330 33
heard 0 330 33
that 0 330 33
the 0 330 33
Council 0 330 33
was 0 330 33
being 0 330 33
convened, 0 330 33
then-Cardinal 0 330 33
Montini 0 330 33
is 0 330 33
supposed 0 330 33
to 0 330 33
have 0 330 33
sighed, 0 330 33
“This 0 330 33
holy 1 330 33
old 1 330 33
boy 1 330 33
doesn’t 0 330 33
realise 0 330 33
what 0 330 33
a 0 330 33
hornet’s 0 330 33
nest 0 330 33
he’s 0 330 33
stirring 0 330 33
up.” 0 330 33

Nonetheless, 0 330 34
he 0 330 34
stirred 0 330 34
it. 0 330 34

The 0 330 35
spirit 0 330 35
of 0 330 35
aggiornamento 0 330 35
quickly 0 330 35
spread 0 330 35
through 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
Church 0 330 35
in 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
1960s 0 330 35
– 0 330 35
and 0 330 35
the 0 330 35
seminaries 0 330 35
especially. 0 330 35

Seminarians 0 330 36
called 0 330 36
for 0 330 36
a 0 330 36
more 0 330 36
“participatory” 0 330 36
administration. 0 330 36

They 0 330 37
became 0 330 37
involved 0 330 37
in 0 330 37
socialist 0 330 37
politics. 0 330 37

They 0 330 38
formed 0 330 38
trade 0 330 38
unions 0 330 38
to 0 330 38
demand 0 330 38
the 0 330 38
right 0 330 38
to 0 330 38
marry. 0 330 38

They 0 330 39
practiced 0 330 39
sauvage 0 330 39
intercommunion. 0 330 39

Of 0 330 40
course, 0 330 40
they 0 330 40
had 0 330 40
their 0 330 40
enablers 0 330 40
in 0 330 40
the 0 330 40
hierarchy 0 330 40
as 0 330 40
well. 0 330 40

Perhaps 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
worst 0 330 41
was 0 330 41
Archbishop 0 330 41
Marty 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
Paris, 0 330 41
a 0 330 41
leader 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
“priest-worker 0 330 41
movement” 0 330 41
who 0 330 41
defended 0 330 41
Marxist 0 330 41
and 0 330 41
existentialist 0 330 41
atheisms 0 330 41
on 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
floor 0 330 41
of 0 330 41
the 0 330 41
Council. 0 330 41

During 0 330 42
a 0 330 42
homily 0 330 42
at 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
Cathedral, 0 330 42
he 0 330 42
also 0 330 42
praised 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
soixantehuitards: 0 330 42
“the 0 330 42
great 0 330 42
outburst 0 330 42
of 0 330 42
the 0 330 42
younger 0 330 42
generation 0 330 42
that 0 330 42
suddenly 0 330 42
wanted 0 330 42
to 0 330 42
take 0 330 42
its 0 330 42
place 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
life” 0 330 42
that 0 330 42
occurred 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
his 0 330 42
city 0 330 42
in 0 330 42
May 0 330 42
of 0 330 42
1968. 0 330 42

“One 0 330 43
also 0 330 43
felt 0 330 43
that, 0 330 43
in 0 330 43
these 0 330 43
events 0 330 43
of 0 330 43
May,” 0 330 43
Marty 0 330 43
continued, 0 330 43
“the 0 330 43
seriousness 0 330 43
of 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
working 0 330 43
class, 0 330 43
which 0 330 43
wants 0 330 43
not 0 330 43
only 0 330 43
to 0 330 43
earn 0 330 43
a 0 330 43
living 0 330 43
wage, 0 330 43
but 0 330 43
also 0 330 43
to 0 330 43
find 0 330 43
its 0 330 43
freedom, 0 330 43
its 0 330 43
independence.” 0 330 43
Theaggiornamentistas 0 330 43
was 0 330 43
never 0 330 43
purged 0 330 43
from 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
Church, 0 330 43
and 0 330 43
certainly 0 330 43
not 0 330 43
from 0 330 43
the 0 330 43
seminaries. 0 330 43

As 0 330 44
the 0 330 44
modern 0 330 44
world 0 330 44
continued 0 330 44
to 0 330 44
reject 0 330 44
traditional 0 330 44
Christian 0 330 44
mores, 0 330 44
so 0 330 44
too 0 330 44
does 0 330 44
the 0 330 44
Church 0 330 44
seem 0 330 44
increasingly 0 330 44
“out 0 330 44
of 0 330 44
step” 0 330 44
and 0 330 44
in 0 330 44
need 0 330 44
of 0 330 44
“modernizing”. 0 330 44

Inevitably, 0 330 45
this 0 330 45
came 0 330 45
to 0 330 45
mean 0 330 45
the 0 330 45
acceptance 0 330 45
of 0 330 45
homosexuality. 0 330 45

Bishop 0 330 46
Wilton 0 330 46
D. 0 330 46
Gregory, 0 330 46
as 0 330 46
president 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
the 0 330 46
U.S. 0 330 46
Conference 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
Catholic 0 330 46
Bishops, 0 330 46
infamously 0 330 46
spoke 0 330 46
of 0 330 46
“an 0 330 46
ongoing 0 330 46
struggle 0 330 46
to 0 330 46
make 0 330 46
sure 0 330 46
that 0 330 46
the 0 330 46
Catholic 0 330 46
priesthood 0 330 46
is 0 330 46
not 0 330 46
dominated 0 330 46
by 0 330 46
homosexual 0 330 46
men.” 0 330 46

But 0 330 47
that 0 330 47
predominance 0 330 47
has 0 330 47
very 0 330 47
little 0 330 47
to 0 330 47
do 0 330 47
with 0 330 47
homosexuality 0 330 47
per 0 330 47
se. 0 330 47

Rather, 0 330 48
the 0 330 48
1960s 0 330 48
rejection 0 330 48
of 0 330 48
celibacy 0 330 48
in 0 330 48
the 0 330 48
seminaries 0 330 48
naturally 0 330 48
provided 0 330 48
more 0 330 48
(shall 0 330 48
we 0 330 48
say) 0 330 48
opportunities 0 330 48
for 0 330 48
gay 0 330 48
men 0 330 48
– 0 330 48
given 0 330 48
that 0 330 48
there 0 330 48
are, 0 330 48
of 0 330 48
course, 0 330 48
no 0 330 48
women 0 330 48
in 0 330 48
Catholic 0 330 48
seminaries. 0 330 48

This 0 330 49
began 0 330 49
driving 0 330 49
away 0 330 49
heterosexuals, 0 330 49
as 0 330 49
well 0 330 49
as 0 330 49
homosexuals 0 330 49
who 0 330 49
upheld 0 330 49
the 0 330 49
Church’s 0 330 49
teachings 0 330 49
on 0 330 49
chastity 0 330 49
and 0 330 49
celibacy. 0 330 49

Needless 0 330 50
to 0 330 50
say, 0 330 50
not 0 330 50
all 0 330 50
gay 0 330 50
priests 0 330 50
are 0 330 50
violent 1 330 50
predators 1 330 50
like 0 330 50
McCarrick. 0 330 50

But 0 330 51
the 0 330 51
toleration 0 330 51
of 0 330 51
sexually 0 330 51
active 0 330 51
priests 0 330 51
gave 0 330 51
McCarrick 0 330 51
cover 0 330 51
to 0 330 51
“seduce” 0 330 51
his 0 330 51
victims. 0 330 51

Many 0 330 52
have 0 330 52
also 0 330 52
speculated 0 330 52
that, 0 330 52
because 0 330 52
McCarrick’s 0 330 52
victims 0 330 52
were 0 330 52
overwhelmingly 0 330 52
above 0 330 52
the 0 330 52
age 0 330 52
of 0 330 52
consent, 0 330 52
the 0 330 52
media 0 330 52
didn’t 0 330 52
consider 0 330 52
them 0 330 52
newsworthy. 0 330 52

If 0 330 53
he’d 0 330 53
fondled 0 330 53
a 0 330 53
12-year 0 330 53
old 0 330 53
altar 0 330 53
boy, 0 330 53
that 0 330 53
would 0 330 53
have 0 330 53
been 0 330 53
one 0 330 53
thing. 0 330 53

Pedophile 1 330 54
priests 1 330 54
sell 1 330 54
papers. 1 330 54

But 0 330 55
taking 0 330 55
an 0 330 55
18-year-old 0 330 55
seminarian 0 330 55
to 0 330 55
bed? 0 330 55

Running 0 330 56
that 0 330 56
story 0 330 56
would 0 330 56
simply 0 330 56
be 0 330 56
outing 0 330 56
a 0 330 56
closeted 1 330 56
gay 1 330 56
man: 1 330 56
an 0 330 56
act 0 330 56
the 0 330 56
liberal 0 330 56
press 0 330 56
would 0 330 56
no 0 330 56
doubt 0 330 56
consider 0 330 56
“homophobic”, 0 330 56
as 0 330 56
Ross 0 330 56
Douthat 0 330 56
pointed 0 330 56
out. 0 330 56

Meanwhile, 0 330 57
those 0 330 57
bishops 0 330 57
who 0 330 57
didn’t 0 330 57
approve 0 330 57
of 0 330 57
his 0 330 57
actions 0 330 57
knew 0 330 57
the 0 330 57
culture 0 330 57
– 0 330 57
both 0 330 57
within 0 330 57
the 0 330 57
Church 0 330 57
and 0 330 57
without 0 330 57
her 0 330 57
– 0 330 57
were 0 330 57
against 0 330 57
them. 0 330 57

The 0 330 58
post-Vatican 0 330 58
Church 0 330 58
doesn’t 0 330 58
like 0 330 58
to 0 330 58
come 0 330 58
off 0 330 58
as 0 330 58
a 0 330 58
nag. 0 330 58

She’s 0 330 59
not 0 330 59
going 0 330 59
to 0 330 59
cause 0 330 59
a 0 330 59
fuss 0 330 59
by 0 330 59
purging 0 330 59
sexually 0 330 59
active 0 330 59
gay 0 330 59
men 0 330 59
from 0 330 59
the 0 330 59
clergy 0 330 59
just 0 330 59
because… 0 330 59
what? 0 330 59

It’s 0 330 60
immoral? 0 330 60

That’s 0 330 61
not 0 330 61
very 0 330 61
aggiornamentistic! 0 330 61

The 0 330 62
world 0 330 62
and 0 330 62
our 0 330 62
worldly 0 330 62
bishops 0 330 62
were, 0 330 62
unsurprisingly, 0 330 62
of 0 330 62
one 0 330 62
mind. 0 330 62

And 0 330 63
even 0 330 63
if 0 330 63
they 0 330 63
were 0 330 63
disgusted 0 330 63
by 0 330 63
McCarrick, 0 330 63
these 0 330 63
prelates 0 330 63
weren’t 0 330 63
willing 0 330 63
to 0 330 63
jeopardize 0 330 63
their 0 330 63
careers 0 330 63
by 0 330 63
standing 0 330 63
for 0 330 63
justice 0 330 63
against 0 330 63
vice. 0 330 63

We 0 330 64
seem 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
be 0 330 64
slouching 0 330 64
back 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
old 0 330 64
traditionalist 0 330 64
trope: 0 330 64
All 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
Church’s 0 330 64
problems 0 330 64
would 0 330 64
be 0 330 64
solved 0 330 64
if 0 330 64
we’d 0 330 64
just 0 330 64
go 0 330 64
back 0 330 64
to 0 330 64
the 0 330 64
Latin 0 330 64
Mass. 0 330 64

Something 0 330 65
went 0 330 65
critically 1 330 65
wrong 1 330 65
during 0 330 65
Vatican 0 330 65
II 0 330 65
that 0 330 65
extends 0 330 65
well 0 330 65
beyond 0 330 65
the 0 330 65
Mass. 0 330 65

And 0 330 66
we 0 330 66
can’t 0 330 66
drag 0 330 66
the 0 330 66
Church 0 330 66
out 0 330 66
of 0 330 66
her 0 330 66
present 0 330 66
crisis 0 330 66
until 0 330 66
we 0 330 66
have 0 330 66
the 0 330 66
courage 0 330 66
to 0 330 66
brave 0 330 66
accusations 0 330 66
of 0 330 66
“Lefebvrism” 0 330 66
and 0 330 66
say 0 330 66
so. 0 330 66

Those 0 330 67
who 0 330 67
love 0 330 67
our 0 330 67
Holy 0 330 67
Mother 0 330 67
– 0 330 67
those 0 330 67
who 0 330 67
want 0 330 67
to 0 330 67
protect 0 330 67
her 0 330 67
boys 0 330 67
and 0 330 67
men 0 330 67
from 0 330 67
all 0 330 67
the 0 330 67
McCarricks 0 330 67
and 0 330 67
their 0 330 67
perverse 1 330 67
appetites 0 330 67
– 0 330 67
mustn’t 0 330 67
be 0 330 67
deceived 0 330 67
into 0 330 67
thinking 0 330 67
this 0 330 67
is 0 330 67
a 0 330 67
small 0 330 67
or 0 330 67
an 0 330 67
isolated 0 330 67
issue. 0 330 67

It 0 330 68
isn’t. 0 330 68

This 0 330 69
is 0 330 69
the 0 330 69
crisis 0 330 69
of 0 330 69
an 0 330 69
ancient 0 330 69
and 0 330 69
immortal 0 330 69
institution 0 330 69
trying 0 330 69
desperately 0 330 69
to 0 330 69
seem 0 330 69
young 0 330 69
and 0 330 69
fashionable; 0 330 69
like 0 330 69
all 0 330 69
old 0 330 69
men, 0 330 69
it 0 330 69
only 0 330 69
manages 0 330 69
to 0 330 69
come 0 330 69
across 0 330 69
as 0 330 69
lecherous 1 330 69
and 1 330 69
pathetic. 1 330 69

Its 0 330 70
obsession 0 330 70
with 0 330 70
“modernization” 0 330 70
leads 0 330 70
it 0 330 70
to 0 330 70
only 0 330 70
adopt 0 330 70
the 0 330 70
vices 0 330 70
of 0 330 70
modernity. 0 330 70

Instead 0 330 71
of 0 330 71

far 0 330 71
too 0 330 71
many 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
our 0 330 71
priests 0 330 71
and 0 330 71
prelates 0 330 71
have 0 330 71
become 0 330 71
agents 0 330 71
of 0 330 71
the 0 330 71
City 0 330 71

show 0 333 24
in 0 333 24

book 0 333 24
The 0 333 24
History 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
Jihad 0 333 24
From 0 333 24
Muhammad 0 333 24
to 0 333 24
ISIS 0 333 24
, 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
great 0 333 24
caliphates 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
history, 0 333 24
from 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
immediate 0 333 24
post-Muhammad 0 333 24
period 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
“Rightly 0 333 24
Guided 0 333 24
Caliphs” 0 333 24
to 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
Umayyads, 0 333 24
Abbasids, 0 333 24
and 0 333 24
Ottomans, 0 333 24
as 0 333 24
well 0 333 24
as 0 333 24
other 0 333 24
Islamic 0 333 24
states, 0 333 24
all 0 333 24
waged 0 333 24
relentless 0 333 24
jihad 0 333 24
warfare 0 333 24
against 0 333 24
non-Muslims, 0 333 24
subjugating 0 333 24
them 0 333 24
under 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
rule 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
Islamic 0 333 24
law 0 333 24
and 0 333 24
denying 0 333 24
them 0 333 24
basic 0 333 24
rights. 0 333 24

These 0 333 25
weren’t 0 333 25
the 0 333 25
actions 0 333 25
of 0 333 25
a 1 333 25
“tiny 1 333 25
minority 1 333 25
of 1 333 25
extremists,” 1 333 25
abhorred 1 333 25
by 1 333 25
the 1 333 25
vast 1 333 25
majority 1 333 25
of 1 333 25
peaceful 1 333 25
Muslims 1 333 25
for 1 333 25
“hijacking” 1 333 25
their 1 333 25
religion. 1 333 25

This 0 333 26
was, 0 333 26
for 0 333 26
fourteen 0 333 26
centuries, 0 333 26
mainstream, 0 333 26
normative 0 333 26
Islam, 0 333 26
carried 0 333 26
forth 0 333 26
by 0 333 26
the 0 333 26
primary 0 333 26
authorities 0 333 26
in 0 333 26
the 0 333 26
Islamic 0 333 26
world 0 333 26
at 0 333 26
the 0 333 26
time. 0 333 26

The 0 333 27
History 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
Jihad 0 333 27
shows 0 333 27
from 0 333 27
the 0 333 27
accounts 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
eyewitnesses 0 333 27
and 0 333 27
contemporary 0 333 27
chroniclers 0 333 27
through 0 333 27
the 0 333 27
ages 0 333 27
that 0 333 27
in 0 333 27
every 0 333 27
age 0 333 27
and 0 333 27
in 0 333 27
every 0 333 27
place 0 333 27
where 0 333 27
there 0 333 27
were 0 333 27
Muslims, 0 333 27
some 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
them 0 333 27
believed 0 333 27
that 0 333 27
they 0 333 27
had 0 333 27
a 0 333 27
responsibility 0 333 27
given 0 333 27
to 0 333 27
them 0 333 27
by 0 333 27
Allah 0 333 27
to 0 333 27
wage 0 333 27
war 0 333 27
against 0 333 27
and 0 333 27
subjugate 0 333 27
unbelievers 0 333 27
under 0 333 27
the 0 333 27
rule 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
Islamic 0 333 27
law. 0 333 27

And 0 333 28
so 0 333 28
it 0 333 28
is 0 333 28
today: 0 333 28
Said 0 333 28
Khecharem 0 333 28
has 0 333 28
enunciated 0 333 28
that 0 333 28
responsibility 0 333 28
more 0 333 28
clearly 0 333 28
and 0 333 28
directly 0 333 28
than 0 333 28
most 0 333 28
Muslim 0 333 28
spokesmen 0 333 28
do 0 333 28
these 0 333 28
days, 0 333 28
but 0 333 28
he 0 333 28
is 0 333 28
by 0 333 28
no 0 333 28
means 0 333 28
the 0 333 28
only 0 333 28
one 0 333 28
who 0 333 28
believes 0 333 28
that 0 333 28
it 0 333 28
exists. 0 333 28

What 0 333 29
is 0 333 29
noteworthy 0 333 29
also 0 333 29
about 0 333 29
The 0 333 29
History 0 333 29
of 0 333 29
Jihad 0 333 29
is 0 333 29
something 0 333 29
that 0 333 29
it 0 333 29
does 0 333 29
not 0 333 29
contain. 0 333 29

As 0 333 30
the 0 333 30
jihadis 0 333 30
move 0 333 30
against 0 333 30
non-Muslim 0 333 30
states 0 333 30
without 0 333 30
any 0 333 30
letup, 0 333 30
pause, 0 333 30
period 0 333 30
of 0 333 30
coexistence, 0 333 30
period 0 333 30
of 0 333 30
tolerance, 0 333 30
reformation, 0 333 30
or 0 333 30
reconsideration, 0 333 30
there 0 333 30
never 0 333 30
appears 0 333 30
any 0 333 30
force 0 333 30
of 0 333 30
Muslims 0 333 30
to 0 333 30
oppose 0 333 30
them. 0 333 30

While 0 333 31
it 0 333 31
is 0 333 31
undoubtedly 0 333 31
true 0 333 31
that 0 333 31
not 0 333 31
all 0 333 31
Muslims 0 333 31
in 0 333 31
any 0 333 31
given 0 333 31
age 0 333 31
have 0 333 31
ever 0 333 31
waged 0 333 31
jihad, 0 333 31
there 0 333 31
has 0 333 31
never 0 333 31
been 0 333 31
in 0 333 31
Islamic 0 333 31
history 0 333 31
an 0 333 31
Islamic 0 333 31
entity 0 333 31
or 0 333 31
organization 0 333 31
that 0 333 31
was 0 333 31
opposed 0 333 31
to 0 333 31
waging 0 333 31
jihad 0 333 31
and 0 333 31
dedicated 0 333 31
to 0 333 31
stopping 0 333 31
those 0 333 31
who 0 333 31
were 0 333 31
waging 0 333 31
it. 0 333 31

So 0 333 32
it 0 333 32
is 0 333 32
today. 0 333 32

Islamic 0 333 33
groups 0 333 33
in 0 333 33
the 0 333 33
West 0 333 33
issue 0 333 33

but 0 333 33
are 0 333 33

nothing 0 333 33

He 0 336 36
also 0 336 36
sought 0 336 36
to 0 336 36
fight 0 336 36
back 0 336 36
against 0 336 36
criticism 0 336 36
in 0 336 36

failure 1 336 36
to 1 336 36
perform 1 336 36
his 1 336 36
job. 1 336 36

“Finally, 0 336 37
I 0 336 37
have 0 336 37
always 0 336 37
welcomed 0 336 37
criticism 0 336 37
and, 0 336 37
as 0 336 37
public 0 336 37
servants, 0 336 37
our 0 336 37
judges 0 336 37
should 0 336 37

Gallegos 0 336 37
said 0 336 37
in 0 336 37
the 0 336 37
statement. 0 336 37

“However, 0 336 38
I 0 336 38
ask 0 336 38
that 0 336 38
you 0 336 38
be 0 336 38
civil 0 336 38
and 0 336 38
respectful 0 336 38
in 0 336 38
your 0 336 38
criticisms 0 336 38
as 0 336 38
that 0 336 38
is 0 336 38
more 0 336 38
constructive. 0 336 38

Cussing 1 336 39
and 1 336 39
threatening 1 336 39
the 0 336 39
people 0 336 39
involved 0 336 39
will 0 336 39
not 0 336 39
accomplish 0 336 39
justice 0 336 39
and 0 336 39
serves 0 336 39
no 0 336 39
useful 0 336 39
purpose. 0 336 39

Remember, 0 336 40
you 0 336 40
do 0 336 40
not 0 336 40
have 0 336 40
all 0 336 40
the 0 336 40
facts. 0 336 40

That 0 336 41
will 0 336 41
develop 0 336 41
as 0 336 41
the 0 336 41
cases 0 336 41
progress." 0 336 41

Yeah, 0 336 42
well, 0 336 42
that's 1 336 42
about 1 336 42
as 1 336 42
trustworthy 1 336 42
as 1 336 42
the 1 336 42
FBI 1 336 42
in 1 336 42
this 1 336 42
matter. 1 336 42

This 0 336 43
latest 0 336 43
move, 0 336 43
while 0 336 43
welcome, 0 336 43
may 0 336 43
only 0 336 43
be 0 336 43
a 0 336 43
response 0 336 43
to 0 336 43
President 0 336 43
Donald 0 336 43
Trump's 0 336 43
vow 0 336 43
to 0 336 43
"get 0 336 43
involved." 0 336 43

However, 1 336 44
I 1 336 44
ask, 1 336 44
why 1 336 44
were 1 336 44
you 1 336 44
not 1 336 44
involved 1 336 44
in 1 336 44
the 1 336 44
first 1 336 44
place, 1 336 44
Mr. 1 336 44
President? 1 336 44

According 1 336 45
to 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
Constitution, 1 336 45
you, 1 336 45
and 1 336 45
you 1 336 45
alone, 1 336 45
are 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
sole 1 336 45
head 1 336 45
of 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
executive 1 336 45
branch, 1 336 45
and 1 336 45
as 1 336 45
such 1 336 45
you 1 336 45
are 1 336 45
where 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
buck 1 336 45
stop 1 336 45
in 1 336 45
making 1 336 45
sure 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
laws 1 336 45
are 1 336 45
faithfully 1 336 45
executed. 1 336 45

So, 0 336 46
if 0 336 46
Trump 0 336 46
is 0 336 46
going 0 336 46
to 0 336 46
fire 0 336 46
Sessions, 0 336 46
perhaps 1 336 46
he 1 336 46
should 1 336 46
stop 1 336 46
talking 1 336 46
about 1 336 46
it 1 336 46
and 1 336 46
get 1 336 46
to 1 336 46
it 1 336 46
and 1 336 46
actually 1 336 46
put 1 336 46
someone 1 336 46
in 1 336 46
the 1 336 46
Justice 1 336 46
Department 1 336 46
as 1 336 46
attorney 1 336 46
general 1 336 46
who 1 336 46
will 1 336 46
do 1 336 46
the 1 336 46
job 1 336 46
faithfully, 1 336 46
and 1 336 46
by 1 336 46
that, 1 336 46
I 1 336 46
don't 1 336 46
mean 1 336 46
Trey 1 336 46
Gowdy. 1 336 46

I 1 336 47
mean 1 336 47
someone 1 336 47
who 1 336 47
is 1 336 47
serious 1 336 47
about 1 336 47
justice, 1 336 47
not 1 336 47
political 1 336 47
grandstanding 1 336 47
or 1 336 47
covering 1 336 47
up 1 336 47
criminal 1 336 47
activity. 1 336 47

Until 0 336 48
then, 0 336 48
I'll 0 336 48
consider 0 336 48
this 0 336 48
the 0 336 48
means 0 336 48
the 0 336 48
FBI 0 336 48
will 0 336 48
use 0 336 48
to 0 336 48
engage 0 336 48
in 0 336 48
the 0 336 48
further 0 336 48
coverup 0 336 48
of 0 336 48
what 0 336 48
really 0 336 48
took 0 336 48
place 0 336 48
at 0 336 48
that 0 336 48
compound 0 336 48
beyond 0 336 48
the 0 336 48
bulldozing 0 336 48
of 0 336 48
a 0 336 48
crime 0 336 48
scene, 0 336 48
and 0 336 48
possibly, 0 336 48
their 0 336 48
own 0 336 48
complicity. 0 336 48

that 0 338 50
Democrats 0 338 50
cover 0 338 50

own, 0 338 50
ignoring 0 338 50
the 0 338 50
obvious 1 338 50
hypocrisy 1 338 50
they 0 338 50
demonstrate 0 338 50
when 0 338 50
they 0 338 50
opponents 0 338 50
are 0 338 50
accused 0 338 50
of 0 338 50
such 0 338 50
things. 0 338 50

Even 0 338 51
one 0 338 51
woman 0 338 51
in 0 338 51
the 0 338 51
Loomer 0 338 51

now 0 338 51

for 0 338 52
Ms. 0 338 52

perhaps 0 338 52
that 0 338 52

but 0 338 52
not 0 338 52
for 0 338 52
Amy 0 338 52

That 0 338 53
report 0 338 53
was 0 338 53

In 0 338 55

can 0 338 55
more 0 338 55
than 0 338 55

Preliminary 0 339 17
information 0 339 17
suggests 0 339 17
that 0 339 17
the 0 339 17
officer 0 339 17
arrived 0 339 17
home 0 339 17
in 0 339 17
full 0 339 17

after 0 339 17
working 0 339 17
a 0 339 17
full 0 339 17
shift. 0 339 17

The 0 339 18
officer 0 339 18
reported 0 339 18
to 0 339 18
the 0 339 18
responding 0 339 18
officers 0 339 18
that 0 339 18
she 0 339 18
entered 0 339 18
the 0 339 18
victim’s 0 339 18

believing 0 339 18
that 0 339 18
it 0 339 18
was 0 339 18
her 0 339 18
own. 0 339 18

At 0 339 19
some 0 339 19
point, 0 339 19
the 0 339 19
officer 0 339 19
fired 0 339 19
her 0 339 19
weapon 0 339 19
striking 0 339 19
the 0 339 19

Responding 0 339 20
officers 0 339 20

to 0 339 20
the 0 339 20
victim, 0 339 20
a 0 339 20
26-year-old 0 339 20
male, 0 339 20
at 0 339 20
the 0 339 20
scene. 0 339 20

The 0 339 21
victim 0 339 21
was 0 339 21
then 0 339 21
transported 0 339 21
to 0 339 21

Office. 0 339 24

This 0 339 25
investigation 0 339 25
is 0 339 25
ongoing 0 339 25

we 0 339 25
will 0 339 25
release 0 339 25
additional 0 339 25
details 0 339 25

they 0 339 25
become 0 339 25

it 0 339 25
is 0 339 25
appropriate 0 339 25
to 0 339 25
do 0 339 25
so. 0 339 25

If 0 339 26
an 0 339 26
average 0 339 26
citizen 0 339 26
walked 0 339 26
into 0 339 26
the 0 339 26
wrong 0 339 26
home 0 339 26
and 0 339 26
shot 0 339 26

killed 0 339 26
an 0 339 26
innocent 1 339 26
homeowner, 0 339 26
rest 0 339 26
assured 0 339 26
that 0 339 26
they 0 339 26
would 0 339 26
be 0 339 26
in 0 339 26
jail—right 0 339 26
now. 0 339 26

However, 0 339 27
instead 0 339 27
of 0 339 27
immediately 0 339 27
arresting 0 339 27
the 0 339 27
officer 0 339 27
for 0 339 27
trespassing 0 339 27
and 0 339 27
murder, 0 339 27
she 0 339 27
was 0 339 27
simply 0 339 27
placed 0 339 27
on 0 339 27
administrative 0 339 27
leave—a 0 339 27
glaring 1 339 27
function 0 339 27
of 0 339 27
blue 1 339 27
privilege 1 339 27
indeed. 0 339 27

“Super 1 339 28

what 0 339 34
is 0 339 34

While 0 340 10
the 0 340 10
Obama 0 340 10
administration 0 340 10
continues 0 340 10
to 0 340 10

American 0 340 10

policy 0 340 10
and, 0 340 10
therefore, 0 340 10
to 0 340 10
implement 0 340 10
“strategies” 0 340 10
that 0 340 10
render 0 340 10
America 0 340 10
defenseless 0 340 10
in 0 340 10
the 0 340 10

Jihad, 1 340 10
there 0 340 10
are 0 340 10
some 0 340 10
alternative 0 340 10

that 0 340 10
have 0 340 10
the 0 340 10

around 0 340 10
completely 0 340 10
in 0 340 10
America’s 0 340 10
favor. 0 340 10

Below 1 340 11
are 1 340 11
9 1 340 11
concrete 1 340 11
steps 1 340 11
that, 1 340 11
if 1 340 11
implemented 1 340 11
by 1 340 11
a 1 340 11
future 1 340 11
American 1 340 11
administration, 1 340 11
would 1 340 11
make 1 340 11
a 1 340 11
big 1 340 11
difference 1 340 11
in 1 340 11
preserving 1 340 11
our 1 340 11
civilization 1 340 11
and 1 340 11
in 1 340 11
defending 1 340 11
Americans 1 340 11
from 1 340 11
terrorism: 1 340 11

1. 0 340 12

Label 0 340 13
the 0 340 13
Enemy 0 340 13
and 0 340 13
Make 0 340 13
a 0 340 13
Threat 0 340 13
Assessment. 0 340 13

The 1 340 14
Obama 1 340 14
administration 1 340 14
continues 1 340 14
to 1 340 14
refuse 1 340 14
to 1 340 14
label 1 340 14
our 1 340 14
enemy 1 340 14
and, 1 340 14
therefore, 1 340 14
it 1 340 14
continues 1 340 14
to 1 340 14
enable 1 340 14
our 1 340 14
defeat 1 340 14
in 1 340 14
the 1 340 14
terror 1 340 14
war. 1 340 14

It 0 340 15
is 0 340 15
urgent 0 340 15
that 0 340 15
we 0 340 15
name 0 340 15
our 1 340 15
enemy 1 340 15
(i.e. 1 340 15

Islamic 1 340 16
Jihad) 1 340 16
and 0 340 16
definitively 0 340 16
identify 0 340 16
what 0 340 16
ideology 0 340 16
inspires 0 340 16
our 1 340 16
enemy 1 340 16
(i.e. 1 340 16

Islamic 1 340 17
law). 1 340 17

2. 0 340 18

Scrap 0 340 19
“Countering 1 340 19
Violent 1 340 19
Extremism.” 1 340 19

“Countering 1 340 20
Violent 1 340 20
Extremism” 1 340 20
is 0 340 20
the 0 340 20
pathetic 1 340 20
and 1 340 20
destructive 1 340 20
focus 0 340 20
of 0 340 20
the 0 340 20
Obama 0 340 20
administration 0 340 20
in 0 340 20
allegedly 0 340 20
fighting 0 340 20
the 0 340 20
terror 0 340 20
war. 0 340 20

On 0 340 21
the 0 340 21
one 0 340 21
hand, 0 340 21
this 0 340 21
“focus” 0 340 21
is 0 340 21
vague 0 340 21
to 0 340 21
the 0 340 21
point 0 340 21
of 0 340 21
being 0 340 21
meaningless 0 340 21
and 0 340 21
completely 1 340 21
incapacitates 1 340 21
us. 1 340 21

On 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
other 1 340 22
hand, 1 340 22
this 1 340 22
focus 1 340 22
allows 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
administration 1 340 22
to 1 340 22
perpetuate 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
destructive 1 340 22
fantasy 1 340 22
that 1 340 22
there 1 340 22
are 1 340 22
other 1 340 22
types 1 340 22
of 1 340 22
“extremists” 1 340 22
— 1 340 22
who 1 340 22
just 1 340 22
happen 1 340 22
to 1 340 22
be 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
Left’s 1 340 22
political 1 340 22
opponents 1 340 22
— 1 340 22
that 1 340 22
pose 1 340 22
a 1 340 22
great 1 340 22
threat 1 340 22
to 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
country. 1 340 22

For 0 340 23
example, 0 340 23
as 0 340 23
Stephen 0 340 23
Coughlin 0 340 23
has 0 340 23
revealed, 0 340 23
the 0 340 23
“violent 1 340 23
extremists” 1 340 23
the 0 340 23
administration 0 340 23
is 0 340 23
clearly 0 340 23
worried 0 340 23
about 0 340 23
are 0 340 23
the 0 340 23
“right-wing 1 340 23
Islamophobes” 1 340 23
whom 1 340 23
the 1 340 23
administration 1 340 23
obviously 1 340 23
considers 1 340 23
to 1 340 23
be 1 340 23
the 1 340 23
real 1 340 23
threat 1 340 23
to 1 340 23
American 1 340 23
security. 1 340 23

The 0 340 24
“Countering 1 340 24
Violent 1 340 24
Extremism” 1 340 24
is 1 340 24
trash 1 340 24
and 1 340 24
needs 1 340 24
to 1 340 24
be 1 340 24
thrown 1 340 24
in 1 340 24
the 1 340 24
garbage. 1 340 24

3. 0 340 25

Stop 0 340 26
“Partnering” 0 340 26
With 0 340 26
Muslim 0 340 26
Brotherhood 0 340 26
Front 0 340 26
Groups. 0 340 26

The 0 340 27
government 0 340 27
needs 0 340 27
to 0 340 27
stop 0 340 27
cooperating 0 340 27
with, 0 340 27
and 0 340 27
listening 0 340 27
to, 0 340 27
Muslim 0 340 27
Brotherhood 0 340 27
front 0 340 27
groups 0 340 27
such 0 340 27
as 0 340 27
CAIR 0 340 27
and 0 340 27
ISNA 0 340 27
immediately. 0 340 27

The 0 340 28
Muslim 0 340 28
Brotherhood 0 340 28
document, 0 340 28
the 0 340 28
Explanatory 0 340 28
Memorandum, 0 340 28
has 0 340 28
made 0 340 28
it 0 340 28
clear 0 340 28
that 0 340 28
the 0 340 28
Brotherhood’s 0 340 28
objective 0 340 28
is 0 340 28
to 1 340 28
destroy 1 340 28
our 1 340 28
civilization 1 340 28
from 1 340 28
within 1 340 28
by 0 340 28
our 0 340 28
own 0 340 28
hands 0 340 28
with 0 340 28
the 0 340 28
influence 0 340 28
of 0 340 28
these 0 340 28
groups. 0 340 28

Moreover, 0 340 29
as 1 340 29
Robert 1 340 29
Spencer 1 340 29
advises, 1 340 29
there 1 340 29
needs 1 340 29
to 1 340 29
be 1 340 29
legislation 1 340 29
that 1 340 29
will 1 340 29
bar 1 340 29
all 1 340 29
such 1 340 29
groups 1 340 29
and 1 340 29
affiliated 1 340 29
individuals 1 340 29
from 1 340 29
advising 1 340 29
the 1 340 29
government 1 340 29
or 1 340 29
receiving 1 340 29
any 1 340 29
grants 1 340 29
from 1 340 29
it. 1 340 29

4. 0 340 30

Implement 0 340 31
a 0 340 31
Concrete 0 340 31
“Countering-Jihad” 1 340 31
Strategy. 1 340 31

After 0 340 32
discarding 0 340 32
the 0 340 32
“Countering 1 340 32
Violent 1 340 32
Extremism” 1 340 32
absurdity, 1 340 32
a 0 340 32
concrete 0 340 32
Counter-Jihad 1 340 32
strategy 1 340 32
must 0 340 32
become 0 340 32
an 0 340 32
official 0 340 32
policy. 0 340 32

It 0 340 33
must 0 340 33
specifically 0 340 33
register 0 340 33
that 0 340 33
Jihadists 1 340 33
are 0 340 33
the 0 340 33
enemies 0 340 33
and 0 340 33
that 0 340 33
Islamic 0 340 33
law 0 340 33
(Sharia) 0 340 33
is 0 340 33
what 0 340 33
specifically 0 340 33
motivates 0 340 33
them. 0 340 33

Most 0 340 34
importantly, 0 340 34
as 1 340 34
Sebastian 1 340 34
Gorka 1 340 34
urges 1 340 34
in 1 340 34
Defeating 1 340 34
Jihad: 1 340 34
The 1 340 34
Winnable 1 340 34
War, 1 340 34
the 1 340 34
government 1 340 34
needs 1 340 34
to 1 340 34
lay 1 340 34
down 1 340 34
a 1 340 34
vision, 1 340 34
an 1 340 34
actual 1 340 34
“threat 1 340 34
doctrine 1 340 34
analysis” 1 340 34
in 1 340 34
a 1 340 34
thorough 1 340 34
document, 1 340 34
just 1 340 34
like 1 340 34
George 1 340 34
Kennan’s 1 340 34
Long 1 340 34
Telegram 1 340 34
and 1 340 34
NSC-68 1 340 34
did 1 340 34
in 1 340 34
laying 1 340 34
out 1 340 34
the 1 340 34
strategic 1 340 34
foundation 1 340 34
to 1 340 34
fighting 1 340 34
communism 1 340 34
in 1 340 34
the 1 340 34
Cold 1 340 34
War. 1 340 34

It 1 340 35
is 1 340 35
absolutely 1 340 35
mind-boggling 1 340 35
that 1 340 35
nothing 1 340 35
of 1 340 35
this 1 340 35
sort 1 340 35
exists 1 340 35
today 1 340 35
in 1 340 35
our 1 340 35
terror 1 340 35
war 1 340 35
— 1 340 35
and 1 340 35
it 1 340 35
is 1 340 35
a 1 340 35
reflection 1 340 35
of 1 340 35
the 1 340 35
Left 1 340 35
being 1 340 35
in 1 340 35
charge 1 340 35
and 1 340 35
of 1 340 35
the 1 340 35
destructive 1 340 35
defeat 1 340 35
that 1 340 35
it 1 340 35
is 1 340 35
sowing. 1 340 35

What 0 340 39
does 0 340 39
our 0 340 39

entail? 0 340 39

Zilch. 1 340 40

Sebastian 1 340 41
Gorka 1 340 41
is 1 340 41
crucially 1 340 41
correct, 1 340 41
therefore, 1 340 41
when 1 340 41
he 1 340 41
recommends 1 340 41
a 1 340 41
national 1 340 41
counter-propaganda 1 340 41
campaign 1 340 41
that 1 340 41
involves 1 340 41
a 1 340 41
two-part 1 340 41
approach: 1 340 41
the 0 340 41
first 0 340 41
being 0 340 41
the 0 340 41
bolstering 0 340 41
of 0 340 41
efforts 0 340 41
to 0 340 41
define 0 340 41
our 0 340 41
enemy 0 340 41
(Steps 0 340 41
#1 0 340 41
and 0 340 41
#4 0 340 41
above) 0 340 41
and, 0 340 41
second, 0 340 41
the 0 340 41
strengthening 0 340 41
of 0 340 41
our 0 340 41
allies 0 340 41
and 0 340 41

in 0 340 41
their 0 340 41
own 0 340 41
counter-propaganda 0 340 41
efforts 0 340 41
– 0 340 41
which 0 340 41
must 0 340 41
include 0 340 41
our 0 340 41
empowering 0 340 41
of 0 340 41

form 0 340 41
an 1 340 41
anti-Jihadist 1 340 41
version 1 340 41
of 1 340 41
Islam. 1 340 41

Consequently, 0 340 42
educational 0 340 42
programs 0 340 42
have 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
be 0 340 42
set 0 340 42
up 0 340 42
everywhere, 0 340 42
from 0 340 42
public 0 340 42
schools 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
universities 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
workplaces, 0 340 42
in 0 340 42
businesses 0 340 42
and 0 340 42
numerous 0 340 42
other 0 340 42
institutions. 0 340 42

These 0 340 43
programs 0 340 43
must 0 340 43
crystallize 0 340 43
what 0 340 43
exactly 0 340 43
Islamic 0 340 43
Law 0 340 43
is 0 340 43
and 0 340 43
how 0 340 43
it 0 340 43
inspires 0 340 43
and 0 340 43
sanctions 0 340 43
violence 0 340 43
against 0 340 43
unbelievers. 1 340 43

This 0 340 44
has 0 340 44
to 0 340 44
also 0 340 44
involve, 0 340 44
as 0 340 44
Gorka 0 340 44
urges, 0 340 44
“a 0 340 44
nationwide 0 340 44
program 0 340 44
of 0 340 44
education 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
includes 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
armed 0 340 44
services 0 340 44
as 0 340 44
well 0 340 44

forces 0 340 44
and 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
intelligence 0 340 44
community.” 0 340 44

The 0 340 45
education 0 340 45
campaign 0 340 45
must 0 340 45
also 0 340 45
focus 0 340 45
on 0 340 45
the 0 340 45
second 0 340 45
part 0 340 45
of 0 340 45
Gorka’s 0 340 45
counter-propaganda 0 340 45
campaign, 0 340 45
which 0 340 45
is 0 340 45
to 0 340 45
help 0 340 45
strengthen 0 340 45
Muslims 0 340 45
who 0 340 45
seek 0 340 45
to 0 340 45
seize 0 340 45
Islam 0 340 45
from 0 340 45
the 1 340 45
jihadists’ 1 340 45
hands. 0 340 45

6. 0 340 46

Affirm 0 340 47
Sharia’s 0 340 47
Assault 0 340 47
on 0 340 47
the 0 340 47
U.S. 0 340 47
Constitution 0 340 47
as 0 340 47
Seditious. 0 340 47

Once 0 340 48
the 0 340 48
truth 0 340 48
is 0 340 48
accepted 0 340 48
that 0 340 48
jihadis 1 340 48
are 0 340 48
inspired 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
sanctioned 0 340 48
by 0 340 48
their 0 340 48
Islamic 0 340 48
texts, 0 340 48
it 0 340 48
must 0 340 48
logically 0 340 48
become 0 340 48
required 0 340 48
that 0 340 48
mosques, 0 340 48
Islamic 0 340 48
schools 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
groups 0 340 48
have 0 340 48
to 0 340 48
immediately 0 340 48
curtail 0 340 48
any 0 340 48
teaching 0 340 48
that 0 340 48
motivates 0 340 48
sedition, 0 340 48
violence, 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
hatred 0 340 48
of 0 340 48
unbelievers 1 340 48
(i.e. 0 340 48

remember 0 340 49
how 0 340 49
CAIR 0 340 49
advised 0 340 49
Muslims 0 340 49
not 0 340 49
to 0 340 49
talk 0 340 49
to 0 340 49
the 0 340 49
FBI). 0 340 49

Indeed, 0 340 50
once 0 340 50
the 0 340 50
government 0 340 50
discerns 0 340 50
and 0 340 50
labels 0 340 50
the 0 340 50
elements 0 340 50
of 0 340 50
Islamic 0 340 50
law 0 340 50
that 0 340 50

of 0 340 50
those 0 340 50
elements 0 340 50
in 0 340 50
America 0 340 50
must 0 340 50
be 0 340 50
labelled 0 340 50
as 0 340 50
seditious. 0 340 50

7. 0 340 51

Put 0 340 52
Pressure 0 340 52
on 0 340 52
Mosques, 0 340 52
Islamic 0 340 52
Groups 0 340 52
and 0 340 52
Schools. 0 340 52

Authorities 0 340 53
have 0 340 53
to 0 340 53
start 0 340 53
subjecting 0 340 53
mosques 0 340 53
and 0 340 53
other 0 340 53
Islamic 0 340 53
institutions 0 340 53
to 0 340 53
surveillance 0 340 53
— 0 340 53
and 0 340 53
discard 0 340 53
the 1 340 53
suicidal 1 340 53
leftist 1 340 53
notion 1 340 53
that 0 340 53
it 0 340 53
is 0 340 53
“racist” 0 340 53
and 0 340 53
Islamophobic 0 340 53
to 0 340 53
do 0 340 53
so. 0 340 53

Islamic 0 340 54
institutions 0 340 54
have 0 340 54
to 0 340 54
be 0 340 54
made 0 340 54
to 0 340 54
buffer 1 340 54
their 1 340 54
lip-service 1 340 54
against 1 340 54
terror 1 340 54
with 0 340 54
actually 0 340 54
doing 0 340 54
something 0 340 54
about 0 340 54
it. 0 340 54

As 1 340 55
Robert 1 340 55
Spencer 1 340 55
counsels, 1 340 55
this 0 340 55
has 0 340 55
to 0 340 55
involve 0 340 55
introducing 0 340 55
programs 0 340 55
that 0 340 55
teach 0 340 55
against 0 340 55
jihadists’ 1 340 55
understanding 0 340 55
of 0 340 55
Islam 0 340 55
— 0 340 55
and 0 340 55
these 0 340 55
programs 0 340 55
have 0 340 55
to 0 340 55
be 0 340 55
regularly 0 340 55
monitored 0 340 55
by 0 340 55
the 0 340 55
government. 0 340 55

(This 0 340 56
will 0 340 56
be 0 340 56
a 0 340 56
part 0 340 56
of 0 340 56
Gorka’s 0 340 56
suggested 0 340 56
counter-propaganda 0 340 56
campaign 0 340 56
discussed 0 340 56
in 0 340 56
Step 0 340 56
#5). 0 340 56

Spencer 0 340 57
rightly 0 340 57
stresses 0 340 57
that 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
paradigm 0 340 57
has 0 340 57
to 0 340 57
become 0 340 57
that 0 340 57
Muslim 0 340 57
communities 0 340 57
have 0 340 57
to 0 340 57
win 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
“trust” 0 340 57
of 0 340 57
intelligence 0 340 57
and 0 340 57
law 0 340 57
enforcement 0 340 57
agents, 0 340 57
rather 0 340 57
than 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
other 0 340 57
way 0 340 57
around, 0 340 57
which 0 340 57
is, 0 340 57
absurdly 1 340 57
and 1 340 57
tragically, 1 340 57
the 0 340 57
case 0 340 57
right 0 340 57
now. 0 340 57

8. 0 340 58

Bring 0 340 59
Counter-Jihadists 1 340 59
into 0 340 59
the 0 340 59
Government. 0 340 59

Instead 0 340 60
of 0 340 60
having 0 340 60
Muslim 0 340 60

sympathizers 0 340 60
like 0 340 60
Mohamed 0 340 60

mysterious 0 340 61
circumstances), 0 340 61
and 0 340 61
Muslim 0 340 61

we 1 340 61
need 1 340 61
to 1 340 61
bring 1 340 61
in 1 340 61
people 1 340 61
who 1 340 61
actually 1 340 61
love 1 340 61
America 1 340 61
and 1 340 61
want 1 340 61
to 1 340 61
protect 1 340 61
it. 1 340 61

We 0 340 62
all 0 340 62
know 0 340 62
who 0 340 62
these 0 340 62

are 0 340 62
referenced 0 340 62
in 0 340 62
this 0 340 62
article. 0 340 62

The 0 340 63
government 0 340 63
must 0 340 63
also 0 340 63
bring 0 340 63
in 0 340 63
brave 1 340 63
Muslim 1 340 63
individuals 1 340 63
who 1 340 63
genuinely 1 340 63
reject 1 340 63
Jihad 1 340 63
and 0 340 63
empower 0 340 63
them 0 340 63
in 0 340 63
propagating 0 340 63
their 0 340 63
anti-jihadist 1 340 63
vision 1 340 63
for 0 340 63
Islam. 0 340 63

(P.S. 0 340 64

Yes, 0 340 65
there 0 340 65
is 0 340 65
an 0 340 65
argument 0 340 65
to 0 340 65
be 0 340 65
made 0 340 65
that 0 340 65
Islam 1 340 65
cannot 1 340 65
be 1 340 65
Islam 1 340 65
without 1 340 65

But 0 340 66
the 0 340 66
debate 0 340 66

this 0 340 66
belongs 0 340 66

And 0 340 67
whatever 0 340 67
the 0 340 67

it 0 340 67
does 0 340 67

that 0 80 14
the 0 80 14

after 0 80 14
working 0 80 14
a 0 80 14
full 0 80 14
shift. 0 80 14

The 0 80 15
officer 0 80 15
reported 0 80 15
to 0 80 15
the 0 80 15
responding 0 80 15

At 0 80 16
some 0 80 16

the 0 80 16

victim. 0 80 16

at 0 80 17
the 0 80 17
scene. 0 80 17

The 0 80 18

Jean, 0 80 26
who 0 80 26
lived 0 80 26
on 0 80 26
the 0 80 26
fourth 0 80 26

the 0 80 26

was 0 80 26
home 0 80 26
alone 0 80 26
when 0 80 26
Guyger 0 80 26
mistook 0 80 26
his 0 80 26
apartment 0 80 26
for 0 80 26
hers, 0 80 26
the 1 80 26
affidavit 1 80 26
says. 1 80 26

Guyger 0 80 27
lived 0 80 27
on 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
third 0 80 27
floor, 0 80 27
directly 0 80 27
beneath 0 80 27
his 0 80 27
apartment, 0 80 27
and 0 80 27
mistakenly 0 80 27
parked 0 80 27
on 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
fourth 0 80 27
floor 0 80 27
after 0 80 27
finishing 0 80 27
a 0 80 27
shift 0 80 27
at 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
Dallas 0 80 27
Police 0 80 27
Department, 0 80 27
the 1 80 27
affidavit 1 80 27
says. 1 80 27

When 0 80 28
she 0 80 28
arrived 0 80 28
at 0 80 28
Jean's 0 80 28
door, 0 80 28
Guyger 0 80 28
entered 0 80 28
a 0 80 28
unique 0 80 28
door 0 80 28
key 0 80 28
with 0 80 28
an 0 80 28
electronic 0 80 28
chip 0 80 28
into 0 80 28
the 0 80 28
keyhole, 0 80 28
the 1 80 28
affidavit 1 80 28
says. 1 80 28

The 0 80 29
door 0 80 29
was 0 80 29
already 0 80 29
ajar, 0 80 29
so 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
force 0 80 29
of 0 80 29
pushing 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
key 0 80 29
inside 0 80 29
opened 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
door, 0 80 29
according 0 80 29
to 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
affidavit. 0 80 29

The 1 80 30
affidavit 1 80 30
says 1 80 30
the 0 80 30
apartments' 0 80 30
"respective 0 80 30
interior 0 80 30
floorplans 0 80 30
are 0 80 30
in 0 80 30
most 0 80 30
ways 0 80 30
identical 0 80 30
or 0 80 30
extremely 0 80 30
similar." 0 80 30

The 0 80 31
apartment 0 80 31
was 0 80 31
dark 0 80 31
and 0 80 31
when 0 80 31
she 0 80 31
saw 0 80 31
"a 0 80 31
large 0 80 31
silhouette," 0 80 31
Guyger 0 80 31
thought 0 80 31
she 0 80 31
was 0 80 31
being 0 80 31
burglarized, 0 80 31
the 1 80 31
affidavit 1 80 31
says. 1 80 31

The 1 80 32
affidavit 1 80 32
says 1 80 32
Guyger 0 80 32
drew 0 80 32
her 0 80 32
gun, 0 80 32
"gave 0 80 32
verbal 0 80 32
commands 0 80 32
that 0 80 32
were 0 80 32
ignored" 0 80 32
and 0 80 32
fired 0 80 32
twice. 0 80 32

Jean 0 80 33
was 0 80 33
struck 0 80 33
once 0 80 33
in 0 80 33
the 0 80 33
torso. 0 80 33

Guyger 0 80 34
then 0 80 34
called 0 80 34
911 0 80 34
from 0 80 34
her 0 80 34
cellphone 0 80 34
and 0 80 34
started 0 80 34
performing 0 80 34
first 0 80 34
aid. 0 80 34

She 0 80 35
turned 0 80 35
on 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
lights, 0 80 35
then 0 80 35
went 0 80 35
to 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
front 0 80 35
door 0 80 35
again 0 80 35
and 0 80 35
realized 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
apartment 0 80 35
wasn't 0 80 35
hers, 0 80 35
the 1 80 35
affidavit 1 80 35
says. 1 80 35

She 0 80 36
told 0 80 36
the 0 80 36
911 0 80 36
operator 0 80 36
as 0 80 36
well 0 80 36
as 0 80 36
responding 0 80 36
officers 0 80 36
that 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
thought 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
was 0 80 36
at 0 80 36
her 0 80 36
apartment 0 80 36
when 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
shot 0 80 36
Jean, 0 80 36
according 1 80 36
to 1 80 36
the 1 80 36
affidavit. 1 80 36

Ok, 0 80 37
some 0 80 37
of 0 80 37
this 0 80 37
seems 0 80 37
plausible, 0 80 37
but 0 80 37
I 0 80 37
still 0 80 37
am 0 80 37
left 0 80 37
wondering 0 80 37
about 0 80 37
the 0 80 37
door 0 80 37
being 0 80 37
ajar. 0 80 37

Is 0 80 38
this 0 80 38
something 0 80 38
people 0 80 38
are 0 80 38
prone 0 80 38
to 0 80 38
do 0 80 38
at 0 80 38
1o 0 80 38
o'clock 0 80 38
at 0 80 38
night 0 80 38
in 0 80 38
Dallas? 0 80 38

In 0 80 39
any 0 80 39
case, 0 80 39
we 0 80 39
all 0 80 39
know 0 80 39
that 0 80 39
any 0 80 39
of 0 80 39
us 0 80 39
who 0 80 39
did 0 80 39
the 0 80 39
same 0 80 39
thing 0 80 39
would 0 80 39
have 0 80 39
immediately 0 80 39
been 0 80 39
taken 0 80 39
into 0 80 39
custody. 0 80 39

As 0 342 26
a 0 342 26
reminder, 0 342 26
in 0 342 26
late 0 342 26
October 0 342 26
of 0 342 26
2016 0 342 26
it 0 342 26
was 0 342 26
revealed 0 342 26
that 0 342 26
just 0 342 26
days 0 342 26
prior 0 342 26
to 0 342 26
the 0 342 26
April 0 342 26
15, 0 342 26
2014 0 342 26
email, 0 342 26
Schmidt 0 342 26
had 0 342 26
sent 0 342 26
another 0 342 26
email 0 342 26
in 0 342 26
which 0 342 26
he 0 342 26
expressed 0 342 26
his 0 342 26
eagerness 0 342 26
to 0 342 26
“fund” 0 342 26
the 0 342 26
campaign 0 342 26
efforts 0 342 26
and 0 342 26
wants 0 342 26
to 0 342 26
be 0 342 26
a 0 342 26
“head 0 342 26
outside 0 342 26
advisor.” 0 342 26
In 0 342 26
the 0 342 26
email 0 342 26
from 0 342 26
John 0 342 26
Podesta 0 342 26
to 0 342 26
Robby 0 342 26
Mook 0 342 26
we 0 342 26
learned 0 342 26
that: 0 342 26

I 0 342 27
met 0 342 27
with 0 342 27
Eric 0 342 27
Schmidt 0 342 27
tonight. 0 342 27

As 0 342 28
David 0 342 28
reported, 0 342 28
he’s 0 342 28
ready 0 342 28
to 0 342 28
fund, 0 342 28
advise 0 342 28
recruit 0 342 28
talent, 0 342 28
etc. 0 342 28

He 0 342 29
was 0 342 29
more 0 342 29
deferential 0 342 29
on 0 342 29
structure 0 342 29
than 0 342 29
I 0 342 29
expected. 0 342 29

Wasn’t 0 342 30
pushing 0 342 30
to 0 342 30
run 0 342 30
through 0 342 30
one 0 342 30
of 0 342 30
his 0 342 30
existing 0 342 30
firms. 0 342 30

Clearly 0 342 31
wants 0 342 31
to 0 342 31
be 0 342 31
head 0 342 31
outside 0 342 31
advisor, 0 342 31
but 0 342 31
didn’t 0 342 31
seem 0 342 31
like 0 342 31
he 0 342 31
wanted 0 342 31
to 0 342 31
push 0 342 31
others 0 342 31
out. 0 342 31

Clearly 0 342 32
wants 0 342 32
to 0 342 32
get 0 342 32
going. 0 342 32

He’s 0 342 33
still 0 342 33
in 0 342 33
DC 0 342 33
tomorrow 0 342 33
and 0 342 33
would 0 342 33
like 0 342 33
to 0 342 33
meet 0 342 33
with 0 342 33
you 0 342 33
if 0 342 33
you 0 342 33
are 0 342 33
in 0 342 33
DC 0 342 33
in 0 342 33
the 0 342 33
afternoon. 0 342 33

I 0 342 34
think 0 342 34
it’s 0 342 34
worth 0 342 34
doing. 0 342 34

You 0 342 35
around? 0 342 35

If 0 342 36
you 0 342 36
are, 0 342 36
and 0 342 36
want 0 342 36
to 0 342 36
meet 0 342 36
with 0 342 36
him, 0 342 36
maybe 0 342 36
the 0 342 36
four 0 342 36
of 0 342 36
us 0 342 36
can 0 342 36
get 0 342 36
on 0 342 36

email 0 342 37
from 0 342 37
February 0 342 37

“I 0 345 3

“That 0 345 4

a 0 345 25

has 0 345 26
called 0 345 26
this 0 345 26
nothing 0 345 26

that 0 345 26

correct. 0 345 26

In 0 345 27

the 0 345 27

not 0 345 29
now 0 345 29

a 0 345 29

which 0 345 29
would 0 345 29
normally 0 345 29
be 0 345 29
handled 0 345 29
by 0 345 29
local 0 345 29
authorities, 0 345 29
if 0 345 29
it 0 345 29

within 0 345 29
the 0 345 29
statute 0 345 29
of 0 345 29
limitations. 0 345 29

The 0 345 30
FBI 0 345 30
instead 0 345 30
passed 0 345 30
the 0 345 30
material 0 345 30
to 0 345 30
the 0 345 30
White 0 345 30

the 0 345 30
person 0 345 30
said. 0 345 30

The 0 345 31
move 0 345 31
is 0 345 31

said 0 345 39
it 0 345 39
over 0 345 39

over! 0 345 39

they 0 345 40

something 0 345 41

to 0 145 15
find 0 145 15
like-minded 0 145 15
Muslims, 0 145 15
and 0 145 15
because 0 145 15
he 1 145 15
wanted 1 145 15
to 1 145 15
do 1 145 15
something 1 145 15
“bigger, 1 145 15
better, 1 145 15

Allah. 1 145 15

But, 0 145 16
he 0 145 16
said, 0 145 16
he 0 145 16
was 0 145 16
afraid 0 145 16

He 1 145 19

In 1 145 24
the 1 145 24

During 0 145 31

mention 0 146 6
that 0 146 6

Rather 1 146 7
than 1 146 7
being 1 146 7
about 1 146 7
receiving 1 146 7
“God’s 1 146 7

The 1 146 8
Catechism 1 146 8
of 1 146 8
the 1 146 8
Catholic 1 146 8
Church 1 146 8
teaches 1 146 8
that 1 146 8
“under 1 146 8
no 1 146 8
circumstances” 1 146 8
can 1 146 8
homosexual 1 146 8
activity 1 146 8
“be 1 146 8
approved” 1 146 8
as 1 146 8
it 1 146 8
is 1 146 8
“intrinsically 1 146 8
disordered.” 1 146 8
Such 1 146 8
acts 1 146 8
are 1 146 8
“contrary 1 146 8
to 1 146 8
the 1 146 8
natural 1 146 8
law. 1 146 8

They 1 146 9
close 1 146 9
the 1 146 9
sexual 1 146 9
act 1 146 9
to 1 146 9
the 1 146 9
gift 1 146 9
of 1 146 9
life. 1 146 9

They 1 146 10
do 1 146 10
not 1 146 10
proceed 1 146 10
from 1 146 10
a 1 146 10
genuine 1 146 10

sexual 1 146 10
complementarity” 1 146 10
(CCC 1 146 10
2357). 1 146 10

However, 0 146 11
Marx 0 146 11
said 0 146 11
on 0 146 11
February 0 146 11
3 0 146 11
that 0 146 11
homosexual 0 146 11
couples 0 146 11
need 0 146 11
“closer 0 146 11
pastoral 0 146 11
care” 0 146 11
and 0 146 11
“one 0 146 11
must 0 146 11

I 1 146 12
do 1 146 12
not 1 146 12
really 1 146 12
see 1 146 12
any 1 146 12
problems 1 146 12
there.” 1 146 12

Marx 0 146 13
is 0 146 13
the 0 146 13
President 0 146 13
of 0 146 13
the 0 146 13
German 0 146 13
Bishops’ 0 146 13
Conference. 0 146 13

As 0 146 14
LifeSiteNews 0 146 14
previously 0 146 14
reported, 0 146 14
Marx 0 146 14
also 0 146 14
said 0 146 14
“yes,” 0 146 14
he 0 146 14
could 0 146 14
imagine 0 146 14
the 0 146 14
creation 0 146 14
of 0 146 14
a 0 146 14
rite 0 146 14
for 0 146 14
homosexual 0 146 14
couples 0 146 14
to 0 146 14
be 0 146 14
blessed 0 146 14
in 0 146 14
the 0 146 14
Church. 0 146 14

This 0 146 15
“encouragement” 0 146 15
from 0 146 15
priests 0 146 15
which 0 146 15
he 0 146 15
called 0 146 15
for 0 146 15
might 0 146 15
include 0 146 15
some 0 146 15
sort 0 146 15
of 0 146 15
“liturgical” 0 146 15
recognition 0 146 15
of 0 146 15
their 0 146 15
union. 0 146 15

But 0 146 16
“how 0 146 16
this 0 146 16
would 0 146 16
be 0 146 16
done 0 146 16
publicly, 0 146 16
in 0 146 16
a 0 146 16
liturgical 0 146 16
form,” 0 146 16
is 0 146 16
“another 0 146 16
question...that 0 146 16
is 0 146 16
where 0 146 16
one 0 146 16
has 0 146 16
to 0 146 16
be 0 146 16
reticent 0 146 16
and 0 146 16
also 0 146 16
reflect 0 146 16
upon 0 146 16
that 0 146 16
in 0 146 16
a 0 146 16
good 0 146 16
way.” 0 146 16

office 0 146 17
contacted 0 146 17
the 0 146 17

part 0 146 17

he 0 146 17
said. 0 146 17

The 0 146 18
cardinal’s 0 146 18

sent 0 146 18

“a 0 146 18

expressing 0 146 18
concern 0 146 18

The 0 146 19
cardinal’s 0 146 19
office 0 146 19
maintains 0 146 19
that 0 146 19
rather 0 146 19
than 0 146 19
saying 0 146 19
“yes,” 0 146 19
there 0 146 19
is 0 146 19
a 0 146 19
possibility 0 146 19

liturgical 0 146 19

of 0 146 19
gay 0 146 19
unions, 0 146 19
he 0 146 19
answered 0 146 19
the 0 146 19
question 0 146 19
in 0 146 19
a 0 146 19
more 0 146 19
subtle 0 146 19
way 0 146 19
without 0 146 19
giving 0 146 19
an 0 146 19
explicit 0 146 19
“yes.” 0 146 19
However, 0 146 19
the 0 146 19
German 0 146 19
Bishops’ 0 146 19
Conference 0 146 19
doesn’t 0 146 19
seem 0 146 19
to 0 146 19
deny 0 146 19
the 0 146 19
rest 0 146 19
of 0 146 19
his 0 146 19
statements 0 146 19
on 0 146 19
how 0 146 19
“one 0 146 19
must 0 146 19
encourage 0 146 19
priests” 0 146 19
to 0 146 19
give 0 146 19
encouragement 0 146 19
to 0 146 19
homosexual 0 146 19

which 0 146 19
could 0 146 19
include 0 146 19
public 0 146 19
blessings 0 146 19
that 0 146 19
would 0 146 19
take 0 146 19
a 0 146 19

form. 0 146 19

The 0 146 20
cardinal’s 0 146 20
staff 0 146 20
asked 0 146 20
that 0 146 20
CNA 0 146 20
change 0 146 20

answer 0 146 20
about 0 146 20
liturgically 0 146 20
“blessing” 0 146 20
gay 0 146 20

to: 0 146 20
“There 0 146 20

I 0 146 20
think 0 146 20
that 0 146 20
would 0 146 20
not 0 146 20
be 0 146 20
right, 0 146 20
because 0 146 20
we 0 146 20
are 0 146 20

about 0 146 20
pastoral 0 146 20
care 0 146 20
for 0 146 20
individual 0 146 20
cases, 0 146 20

that 0 146 20
applies 0 146 20
to 0 146 20
other 0 146 20

we 0 146 20
cannot 0 146 20

Philadelphia 0 146 21
Archbishop 0 146 21
Charles 0 146 21
Chaput 0 146 21
has 0 146 21
also 0 146 21
spoken 0 146 21
out 0 146 21
against 0 146 21
Marx’s 0 146 21
proposal. 0 146 21

“Any 1 146 22
such 1 146 22
‘blessing 1 146 22
rite’ 1 146 22
would 1 146 22
cooperate 1 146 22
in 1 146 22
a 1 146 22
morally 1 146 22
forbidden 1 146 22

the 1 146 22
blessing,” 1 146 22
wrote 0 146 22
Chaput. 0 146 22

He 0 146 23
explained 0 146 23
such 1 146 23
a 1 146 23
“blessing” 1 146 23
would 1 146 23
encourage 1 146 23
people 1 146 23
to 1 146 23
continue 1 146 23
living 1 146 23
in 1 146 23
a 1 146 23
way 1 146 23
the 1 146 23
Church 1 146 23
considers 1 146 23
gravely 1 146 23
sinful 1 146 23
and 1 146 23
spiritually 1 146 23
damaging, 1 146 23
and 1 146 23
therefore 1 146 23
would 1 146 23
be 1 146 23
uncharitable. 1 146 23

“There 0 146 24
is 0 146 24

Chaput 0 146 26
wrote. 0 146 26

“First, 0 146 27
we 0 146 27
need 0 146 27
to 0 146 27

all 0 146 27
people 0 146 27

Second, 0 146 29
there 1 146 29
is 1 146 29

“This 0 146 30

Hey, 0 149 1
remember 0 149 1
five 0 149 1
minutes 0 149 1
ago 0 149 1
when 0 149 1
Pope 0 149 1
Francis 0 149 1
shouted 0 149 1
at 0 149 1
a 0 149 1
reporter 0 149 1
in 0 149 1
Chile 0 149 1
that 0 149 1
there 0 149 1
was 0 149 1
“no 0 149 1

supporting 0 149 1
complaints 0 149 1

his 1 149 1
good 1 149 1
friend 1 149 1
Bishop 1 149 1
Juan 1 149 1
Barros? 1 149 1

And, 0 149 2
just 0 149 2
for 0 149 2
good 0 149 2
measure 0 149 2
he 0 149 2
accused 0 149 2
the 0 149 2
people 0 149 2
accusing 0 149 2
him 0 149 2
– 0 149 2
victims 0 149 2
of 0 149 2
sexual 0 149 2

by 0 149 2

the 1 149 2
convicted 1 149 2

– 0 149 2
of 0 149 2
committing 0 149 2
“calumny”? 1 149 2

[1] 0 149 3
And 0 149 3
remember 0 149 3
when 0 149 3
Cardinal 0 149 3
O’Malley 0 149 3
told 0 149 3
the 0 149 3
pope 0 149 3
off 0 149 3
in 0 149 3
public 0 149 3
over 0 149 3
the 0 149 3
“pain” 1 149 3
these 0 149 3
accusations 0 149 3
had 0 149 3
caused 0 149 3
the 0 149 3
victims 0 149 3
of 0 149 3
sexual 0 149 3
abuse? 0 149 3

And 0 149 4
then 0 149 4
remember 0 149 4
how 0 149 4
the 0 149 4
pope 0 149 4
had 1 149 4
apologised-except-not-really 1 149 4
because 0 149 4
the 1 149 4
accusations 1 149 4
are, 1 149 4
after 1 149 4
all, 1 149 4
still 1 149 4
lies, 1 149 4
and 1 149 4
that 1 149 4
there’s 1 149 4
still 1 149 4
“no 1 149 4

against 1 149 4
Barros…? 1 149 4

full 0 149 5
this 0 149 5
week 0 149 5

the 0 149 5
story 0 149 5
that 0 149 5
the 0 149 5

indeed 0 149 5

– 0 149 5
not 0 149 5
only 0 149 5
that 0 149 5
Barros 0 149 5
had 0 149 5
helped 0 149 5
to 0 149 5
cover 0 149 5
it 0 149 5
up 0 149 5
but 0 149 5
that 0 149 5
he 0 149 5
had 0 149 5
been 0 149 5
present 0 149 5
and 0 149 5
a 0 149 5

from 0 149 6
the 0 149 6
victims, 0 149 6
whom 0 149 6

Pope 0 149 7
Francis 0 149 7

a 0 149 7
victim’s 0 149 7
letter 0 149 7
in 0 149 7
2015 0 149 7
that 0 149 7
graphically 0 149 7
detailed 0 149 7
how 0 149 7
a 0 149 7
priest 0 149 7
sexually 0 149 7
abused 0 149 7
him 0 149 7
and 0 149 7
how 0 149 7
other 0 149 7
Chilean 0 149 7
clergy 0 149 7
ignored 0 149 7
it, 0 149 7
contradicting 0 149 7
the 0 149 7
pope’s 0 149 7
recent 0 149 7
insistence 0 149 7
that 0 149 7
no 0 149 7
victims 0 149 7
had 0 149 7
come 0 149 7
forward 0 149 7
to 0 149 7
denounce 0 149 7
the 0 149 7
cover-up, 0 149 7
the 0 149 7
letter’s 0 149 7
author 0 149 7
and 0 149 7
members 0 149 7
of 0 149 7

told 0 149 7
The 0 149 7

The 0 149 8
fact 0 149 8
that 0 149 8
Francis 0 149 8
received 0 149 8
the 0 149 8
eight-page 0 149 8
letter, 0 149 8
obtained 0 149 8
by 0 149 8
the 0 149 8
AP, 0 149 8
challenges 0 149 8
his 0 149 8
insistence 0 149 8
that 0 149 8
he 0 149 8
has 0 149 8
“zero 0 149 8
tolerance” 0 149 8
for 0 149 8
sex 0 149 8
abuse 0 149 8
and 0 149 8
cover-ups. 0 149 8

It 1 149 9
also 1 149 9
calls 1 149 9
into 1 149 9
question 1 149 9
his 1 149 9
stated 1 149 9
empathy 1 149 9
with 1 149 9

of 0 149 9
his 0 149 9
five-year 0 149 9
papacy. 0 149 9

Now 0 149 10
it 0 149 10
appears 0 149 10
that 0 149 10
Francis 0 149 10
had 0 149 10

a 0 149 11

that 0 149 11
the 0 149 11

Five 0 149 16
reports, 0 149 16
via 0 149 16
Marco 0 149 16
Tosatti, 0 149 16
that 0 149 16
the 0 149 16
pope 0 149 16
ordered 0 149 16
their 0 149 16
removal 0 149 16

When, 0 149 17
after 0 149 17
several 0 149 17
attempts 0 149 17
and 0 149 17
three 0 149 17
months 0 149 17
later[2], 0 149 17
Muller 0 149 17
was 0 149 17
able 0 149 17
to 0 149 17
get 0 149 17
an 0 149 17
audience 0 149 17
with 0 149 17
the 0 149 17
pope 0 149 17
to 0 149 17
ask 0 149 17
the 0 149 17
reason, 0 149 17
he 0 149 17
received 0 149 17
the 0 149 17
response, 0 149 17
“I 0 149 17
am 1 149 17
the 1 149 17
pope, 1 149 17
I 1 149 17
do 1 149 17
not 1 149 17
need 1 149 17
to 1 149 17
give 1 149 17
reasons 1 149 17
for 1 149 17
any 1 149 17
of 1 149 17
my 1 149 17
decisions. 1 149 17

I 1 149 18
have 1 149 18
decided 1 149 18
that 1 149 18
they 1 149 18
have 1 149 18
to 1 149 18
leave 1 149 18
and 1 149 18
they 1 149 18
have 1 149 18
to 1 149 18
leave.” 1 149 18

Marco 0 149 19
Tosatti 0 149 19
reports 0 149 19
the 0 149 19
CDF 0 149 19
incident, 0 149 19
but 0 149 19
it 0 149 19
follows 0 149 19
an 0 149 19
odd 0 149 19
story 0 149 19
of 0 149 19
a 0 149 19
meeting 0 149 19
of 0 149 19
curial 0 149 19
officials 0 149 19
to 0 149 19
discuss 0 149 19
certain 0 149 19
bishop 0 149 19
appointments. 0 149 19

Without 0 149 20
naming 0 149 20
names, 0 149 20
(or, 0 149 20
frustratingly, 0 149 20
giving 0 149 20
dates[3]) 0 149 20
Tosatti 0 149 20
relates: 0 149 20

“It 0 149 21
was 0 149 21
some 0 149 21
time 0 149 21
ago 0 149 21
to 0 149 21
make 0 149 21
a 0 149 21
bishop, 0 149 21
not 0 149 21
in 0 149 21
Italy. 0 149 21

The 0 149 22
nuncio 0 149 22
has 0 149 22
prepared 0 149 22
the 0 149 22
triad 0 149 22
[the 0 149 22
“terna” 0 149 22
or 0 149 22
list 0 149 22
of 0 149 22
three 0 149 22
candidates]. 0 149 22

A 0 149 23
cardinal, 0 149 23
head 0 149 23
of 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
dicastery, 0 149 23
perhaps 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
same 0 149 23
holder 0 149 23
of 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
Congregation 0 149 23
for 0 149 23
Bishops, 0 149 23
during 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
ordinary 0 149 23
assembly 0 149 23
took 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
floor, 0 149 23
saying: 0 149 23
‘The 0 149 23
first 0 149 23
candidate 0 149 23
indicated 0 149 23
is 0 149 23
excellent, 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
second 0 149 23
is 0 149 23
good. 0 149 23

But 0 149 24
I 0 149 24
would 0 149 24
like 0 149 24
to 0 149 24
warn 0 149 24
of 0 149 24
the 0 149 24
third, 0 149 24
whom 0 149 24
I 0 149 24
know 0 149 24
well, 0 149 24
since 0 149 24
he 0 149 24
was 0 149 24
a 0 149 24
seminarian, 0 149 24
and 0 149 24
who 0 149 24
presents 0 149 24
problems 0 149 24
both 0 149 24
on 0 149 24
the 0 149 24
level 0 149 24
of 0 149 24
doctrine 0 149 24
and 0 149 24
morality. 0 149 24

He 0 149 25
responds 0 149 25
little 0 149 25
to 0 149 25
the 0 149 25
necessary 0 149 25
criteria. 0 149 25

But 0 149 26
the 0 149 26
third 0 149 26
was 0 149 26
a 0 149 26
friend 0 149 26
of 0 149 26
someone 0 149 26
and 0 149 26
another 0 149 26
cardinal, 0 149 26
of 0 149 26
the 0 149 26
circle 0 149 26
currently 0 149 26
in 0 149 26
power, 0 149 26
has 0 149 26
flung 0 149 26
himself 0 149 26
at 0 149 26
his 0 149 26
colleague, 0 149 26
accusing 0 149 26
him 0 149 26
of 0 149 26
impropriety.’ 0 149 26
The 0 149 26
meeting 0 149 26
ended 0 149 26
without 0 149 26
further 0 149 26
decisions.” 0 149 26

Whatever 0 149 27
the 0 149 27
details 0 149 27
of 0 149 27
these 0 149 27
strange 0 149 27
incidents, 0 149 27
what 0 149 27
is 0 149 27
clear 0 149 27
in 0 149 27
Chile 0 149 27
is 0 149 27
that 0 149 27
no 0 149 27
amount 0 149 27
of 0 149 27
eyewitness 0 149 27
testimony 0 149 27
was 0 149 27
going 0 149 27
to 0 149 27
make 0 149 27
the 0 149 27
slightest 0 149 27
difference. 0 149 27

Bergoglio 0 149 28
wanted 0 149 28
Barros 0 149 28
as 0 149 28
a 0 149 28
bishop 0 149 28
and 0 149 28
that 0 149 28
was 0 149 28
that. 0 149 28

Even 0 149 29
while 0 149 29
“apologising” 0 149 29
the 0 149 29
pope 0 149 29
had 0 149 29
doubled 0 149 29
down 0 149 29
when 0 149 29
questioned 0 149 29
about 0 149 29
it 0 149 29
by 0 149 29
journalists, 0 149 29
saying, 0 149 29
“You, 0 149 29
in 0 149 29
all 0 149 29
good 0 149 29
will, 0 149 29
tell 0 149 29
me 0 149 29
that 0 149 29
there 0 149 29
are 0 149 29
victims, 0 149 29
but 0 149 29
I 0 149 29
haven’t 0 149 29
seen 0 149 29
any, 0 149 29
because 0 149 29
they 0 149 29
haven’t 0 149 29
come 0 149 29
forward.” 0 149 29

“In 0 149 30
the 0 149 30
case 0 149 30
of 0 149 30
Barros 0 149 30
it’s 0 149 30
been 0 149 30
observed, 0 149 30
it’s 0 149 30
been 0 149 30
studied; 0 149 30
there’s 0 149 30
no 0 149 30
evidence. 0 149 30

The 0 149 31
best 0 149 31
thing 0 149 31
to 0 149 31
do 0 149 31
if 0 149 31
someone 0 149 31
believes 0 149 31
it’s 0 149 31
the 0 149 31
case 0 149 31
is 0 149 31
to 0 149 31
come 0 149 31

with 0 149 31
evidence.” 0 149 31

The 0 149 32
AP 0 149 32
report, 0 149 32
however, 0 149 32
says 0 149 32
exactly 0 149 32
the 0 149 32
opposite; 0 149 32
that 0 149 32
members 0 149 32
of 0 149 32

and 0 149 33
Commission 0 149 33
member 0 149 33
who 0 149 33
resigned, 0 149 33
citing 0 149 33
the 0 149 33
Vatican’s 0 149 33
refusal 0 149 33
to 0 149 33
take 0 149 33
meaningful 0 149 33
action, 0 149 33
told 0 149 33
AP, 0 149 33
“When 0 149 33
we 0 149 33
gave 0 149 33
him 0 149 33
[O’Malley] 0 149 33
the 0 149 33
letter 0 149 33
for 0 149 33

he 0 149 33
assured 0 149 33

he 0 149 33
would 0 149 33

it 0 149 33
to 0 149 33
the 0 149 33

at 0 149 34
a 0 149 34

membership 0 149 34
on 0 149 34
the 0 149 34
Commission 0 149 34
the 0 149 34
Vatican 0 149 34
had 0 149 34
blocked, 0 149 34
told 0 149 34
AP, 0 149 34
“Cardinal 0 149 34
O’Malley 0 149 34
called 0 149 34
me 0 149 34

visit 0 149 34
here 0 149 34
in 0 149 34

among 0 149 34
other 0 149 34
things, 0 149 34
that 0 149 34

the 0 149 34
pope 0 149 34
– 0 149 34
in 1 149 34
his 1 149 34
hands.” 1 149 34

On 0 149 35
the 0 149 35
face 0 149 35
of 0 149 35
it, 0 149 35
there 0 149 35
are 0 149 35
only 0 149 35
a 0 149 35
few 0 149 35
logical 0 149 35
possibilities 0 149 35
here. 0 149 35

In 0 149 36
fact, 0 149 36
unless 0 149 36
Cardinal 0 149 36
O’Malley 0 149 36
– 0 149 36
who 0 149 36
has, 0 149 36
as 0 149 36
of 0 149 36
this 0 149 36
writing, 0 149 36
remained 0 149 36
silent 0 149 36
– 0 149 36
comes 0 149 36
forward 0 149 36
and 0 149 36
says 0 149 36
that 0 149 36
he 0 149 36
didn’t 0 149 36
hand 0 149 36
the 0 149 36
letter 0 149 36
over 0 149 36
pope, 0 149 36
there 0 149 36
is 0 149 36
really 0 149 36
only 0 149 36
one; 0 149 36
that 0 149 36
the 0 149 36
pope 0 149 36
lied. 0 149 36

And 0 149 37
this 0 149 37
is 0 149 37
what 0 149 37
is 0 149 37
now 0 149 37
being 0 149 37
said 0 149 37
quite 0 149 37
openly 0 149 37
by 0 149 37
a 0 149 37
vast 0 149 37
array 0 149 37
of 0 149 37
voices, 0 149 37
secular 0 149 37
and 0 149 37
Catholic, 0 149 37
left 0 149 37
and 0 149 37
right. 0 149 37

As 0 149 38
Winfield 0 149 38
writes, 0 149 38

“The 0 149 39
revelation 0 149 39
could 0 149 39
be 0 149 39
costly 0 149 39
for 0 149 39
Francis, 0 149 39
whose 0 149 39
track 0 149 39
record 0 149 39
on 0 149 39
the 0 149 39
abuse 0 149 39
crisis 0 149 39
was 0 149 39
already 0 149 39
shaky 0 149 39
after 0 149 39
a 0 149 39
botched 0 149 39
Italian 0 149 39
abuse 0 149 39
case 0 149 39
he 0 149 39
intervened 0 149 39
in 0 149 39
became 0 149 39
public[5]. 0 149 39

More 0 149 40
recently, 0 149 40
he 0 149 40
let 0 149 40
the 0 149 40
abuse 0 149 40
commission 0 149 40
lapse 0 149 40
at 0 149 40
the 0 149 40
end 0 149 40
of 0 149 40
last 0 149 40
year. 0 149 40

Vatican 0 149 41
analysts 0 149 41
now 0 149 41
openly 0 149 41
question 0 149 41
whether 0 149 41
he 0 149 41
‘gets 0 149 41
it,’ 0 149 41
and 0 149 41
some 0 149 41
of 0 149 41
his 0 149 41
own 0 149 41
advisers 0 149 41
privately 0 149 41
acknowledge 0 149 41
that 0 149 41
maybe 0 149 41
he 0 149 41
doesn’t.” 0 149 41

“No 0 149 42
evidence…” 0 149 42
Lie 1 149 42
big, 1 149 42
lie 1 149 42
often, 1 149 42
and 1 149 42
when 1 149 42
caught, 1 149 42
keep 1 149 42
lying. 1 149 42

One 0 149 43
of 0 149 43
the 0 149 43
many 0 149 43
things 0 149 43
these 0 149 43
secular 1 149 43
reporters 1 149 43
seem 0 149 43
not 0 149 43
to 0 149 43
be 0 149 43
paying 0 149 43
attention 0 149 43
to 0 149 43
is 0 149 43
that 0 149 43
“no 0 149 43
evidence” 0 149 43
is 0 149 43
in 0 149 43
fact 0 149 43
a 0 149 43
well-rehearsed, 0 149 43
stock 0 149 43
response 0 149 43
for 0 149 43
Bergoglio. 0 149 43

He 0 149 44
said 0 149 44
almost 0 149 44
exactly 0 149 44
the 0 149 44

It 0 149 46
was 0 149 46

to 0 149 46
a 0 149 46
question 0 149 46
by 0 149 46
a 0 149 46
journalist 0 149 46
about 0 149 46
Monsignore 0 149 46
Battista 0 149 46
Ricca 0 149 46
– 0 149 46
a 0 149 46
prelate 0 149 46
whose 0 149 46
promiscuous 0 149 46
homosexuality 0 149 46
is 0 149 46
so 0 149 46
well 0 149 46
known 0 149 46
it 0 149 46
was 0 149 46
covered 0 149 46
by 0 149 46
the 0 149 46
Telegraph 0 149 46
as 0 149 46
early 0 149 46
as 0 149 46
July 0 149 46
2013. 0 149 46

Ilze 0 149 47
Scamparini 0 149 47
asked 0 149 47
the 0 149 47
pope 0 149 47
about 0 149 47
Ricca, 0 149 47
saying, 0 149 47
“What 0 149 47
you 0 149 47
intend 0 149 47
to 0 149 47
do 0 149 47
about 0 149 47
this? 0 149 47

How 0 149 48
are 0 149 48
you 0 149 48
confronting 0 149 48
this 0 149 48
issue 0 149 48
and 0 149 48
how 0 149 48
does 0 149 48
Your 0 149 48
Holiness 0 149 48
intend 0 149 48
to 0 149 48
confront 0 149 48
the 0 149 48
whole 0 149 48
question 0 149 48
of 0 149 48
the 0 149 48
gay 0 149 48
lobby?” 0 149 48

What 0 149 49
reply 0 149 49
did 0 149 49
Bergoglio 0 149 49
give? 0 149 49

His 0 149 50
standard 0 149 50
one: 0 149 50
“No 1 149 50
evidence.” 1 149 50

About 0 149 51
Monsignor 0 149 51
Ricca: 0 149 51
I 0 149 51
did 0 149 51
what 0 149 51
canon 0 149 51
law 0 149 51
calls 0 149 51
for, 0 149 51
that 0 149 51
is 0 149 51
a 0 149 51
preliminary 0 149 51
investigation. 0 149 51

And 0 149 52
from 0 149 52
this 0 149 52
investigation, 0 149 52
there 0 149 52
was 0 149 52
nothing 0 149 52
of 0 149 52
what 0 149 52
had 0 149 52
been 0 149 52
alleged. 0 149 52

We 0 149 53
did 0 149 53
not 0 149 53
find 0 149 53
anything 0 149 53
of 0 149 53
that. 0 149 53

This 0 149 54
is 0 149 54
the 0 149 54
response.” 0 149 54

He 0 149 55
added, 0 149 55
“In 0 149 55
this 0 149 55
case, 0 149 55
I 0 149 55
conducted 0 149 55
the 0 149 55
preliminary 0 149 55
investigation 0 149 55
and 0 149 55
we 0 149 55
didn’t 0 149 55
find 0 149 55
anything.” 0 149 55

But 0 149 56
Ricca’s 0 149 56
activities, 0 149 56
for 0 149 56
which 0 149 56
the 0 149 56
pope 0 149 56
claimed 0 149 56
there 0 149 56
was 0 149 56
no 0 149 56
evidence, 0 149 56
were 0 149 56
notorious. 0 149 56

They 0 149 57
include 0 149 57
being 0 149 57
caught 0 149 57
in 0 149 57
flagrante 0 149 57
in 0 149 57
an 0 149 57
elevator 0 149 57
with 0 149 57
a 0 149 57
teenaged 0 149 57
male 0 149 57
prostitute, 0 149 57
and 0 149 57
his 0 149 57
sexual 0 149 57
relationship 0 149 57
with 0 149 57
a 0 149 57
captain 0 149 57
in 0 149 57
the 0 149 57
Swiss 0 149 57
army. 0 149 57

So 0 149 58
flagrant 1 149 58
was 0 149 58
Ricca’s 0 149 58
behaviour 0 149 58
that 0 149 58
it 0 149 58
took 0 149 58
intervention 0 149 58
by 0 149 58
Uruguay’s 0 149 58
nuncio 0 149 58
to 0 149 58
have 0 149 58
him 0 149 58
removed. 0 149 58

It 0 149 59
was 0 149 59
reported 0 149 59
in 0 149 59
1999 0 149 59
and 0 149 59
2000 0 149 59
by 0 149 59
L’Espresso, 0 149 59
who 0 149 59
said 0 149 59
the 0 149 59
information 0 149 59
was 0 149 59
confirmed 0 149 59
by 0 149 59
“numerous 0 149 59
bishops, 0 149 59
priests, 0 149 59
religious 0 149 59
and 0 149 59
laity” 0 149 59
in 0 149 59
Uruguay[6]. 0 149 59

In 0 149 60
fact, 0 149 60
the 0 149 60
evidence 0 149 60
shows 0 149 60
that 0 149 60
Ricca 0 149 60
is 0 149 60
completely 0 149 60
in 0 149 60
line 0 149 60
with 0 149 60
Bergoglio’s 0 149 60
normal 0 149 60
procedures. 0 149 60

As 0 149 61
“Marcantonio 0 149 61
Colonna” 0 149 61
wrote 0 149 61
in 0 149 61
the 0 149 61
Dictator 0 149 61
Pope, 0 149 61
“In 0 149 61
fact 0 149 61
his 0 149 61
patronage 0 149 61
of 0 149 61
Monsignor 0 149 61
Ricca 0 149 61
fits 0 149 61
the 0 149 61
pattern 0 149 61
which 0 149 61
was 0 149 61
well 0 149 61
established 0 149 61
when 0 149 61
he 0 149 61
was 0 149 61
Archbishop 0 149 61
of 0 149 61
Buenos 0 149 61
Aires, 0 149 61
whereby 0 149 61
he 0 149 61
surrounds 0 149 61
himself 0 149 61
with 0 149 61
morally 0 149 61
weak 0 149 61
people 0 149 61
so 0 149 61
as 0 149 61
to 0 149 61
have 0 149 61
them 0 149 61
under 1 149 61
his 1 149 61
thumb.” 1 149 61

It 0 149 62
was 0 149 62
at 0 149 62
this 0 149 62
early 0 149 62
“no 0 149 62
evidence” 0 149 62
comment 0 149 62
on 0 149 62
the 0 149 62
plane 0 149 62
home 0 149 62
from 0 149 62
Rio 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
some 0 149 62
of 0 149 62
those 0 149 62
paying 0 149 62
attention 0 149 62
started 0 149 62
to 0 149 62
understand 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
Bergoglio’s 0 149 62
policy 0 149 62
is 0 149 62
in 0 149 62
line 0 149 62
with 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
of 0 149 62
certain 0 149 62
leaders 0 149 62
of 0 149 62
the 0 149 62
past 0 149 62
who 0 149 62
recommended 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
if 0 149 62
a 0 149 62
politician 0 149 62
was 0 149 62
going 0 149 62
to 0 149 62
lie, 0 149 62
he 0 149 62
should 0 149 62
lie 1 149 62
big 1 149 62
and 1 149 62
lie 1 149 62
brazenly. 1 149 62

And 0 149 63
in 0 149 63
case 0 149 63
anyone 0 149 63
was 0 149 63
wondering 0 149 63
what 0 149 63
will 0 149 63
happen 0 149 63
next, 0 149 63
the 0 149 63
same 0 149 63
advice 0 149 63
said 0 149 63
to 0 149 63
keep 0 149 63
on 0 149 63
lying 0 149 63
after 0 149 63
you’re 0 149 63
caught. 0 149 63

The 0 149 64
pattern 0 149 64
of 0 149 64
silence 0 149 64
and, 0 149 64
when 0 149 64
pressed, 0 149 64
flat-out 0 149 64
denial 0 149 64
has 0 149 64
been 0 149 64
Bergoglio’s 0 149 64
policy 0 149 64
since 0 149 64
long 0 149 64
before 0 149 64
he 0 149 64
came 0 149 64
on 0 149 64
the 0 149 64
international 0 149 64
scene. 0 149 64

He 0 149 65
has 0 149 65
a 0 149 65
long 0 149 65
record 0 149 65
in 0 149 65
Argentina 0 149 65
of 0 149 65
shaving 0 149 65
close 0 149 65
to 0 149 65
scandals 0 149 65
and 0 149 65
vociferously 0 149 65
denying 0 149 65
involvement, 0 149 65
and 0 149 65
relying 0 149 65
heavily 0 149 65
on 0 149 65
the 0 149 65
broad 0 149 65
good 0 149 65
will 0 149 65
of 0 149 65
Catholics 0 149 65
towards 0 149 65
bishops 0 149 65
to 0 149 65
pull 0 149 65
it 0 149 65
off. 0 149 65

Perhaps 0 149 66
his 0 149 66
biggest 0 149 66
error 0 149 66
with 0 149 66
Barros 0 149 66
was 0 149 66
failing 0 149 66
to 0 149 66
understand 0 149 66
just 0 149 66
how 0 149 66
little 0 149 66
of 0 149 66
that 0 149 66
capital 0 149 66
of 0 149 66
trust 0 149 66
there 0 149 66
is 0 149 66
left 0 149 66
in 0 149 66
the 0 149 66
Catholic 0 149 66
world 0 149 66
as 0 149 66
a 0 149 66
whole. 0 149 66

Indeed, 0 149 67
on 0 149 67
the 0 149 67
subject 0 149 67
of 0 149 67
priests 0 149 67
sexually 0 149 67
abusing 0 149 67
young 0 149 67
people, 0 149 67
it 0 149 67
could 0 149 67
only 0 149 67
be 0 149 67
measured 0 149 67
in 0 149 67
the 0 149 67
negative 0 149 67
numbers. 0 149 67

“Argentine 0 149 68

the 0 149 69

their 0 149 69
data 0 149 69
is 0 149 69
unassailable 0 149 69
since 0 149 69
most 0 149 69
of 0 149 69
it 0 149 69
comes 0 149 69
from 0 149 69

that 0 149 69
is 0 149 69
already 0 149 69
public. 0 149 69

On 0 149 70
their 0 149 70
Argentina 0 149 70

a 0 149 70
long 0 149 70
list 0 149 70
of 0 149 70
accusations 0 149 70
that 0 149 70
Bergoglio/Francis 0 149 70
simply 0 149 70
isn’t 0 149 70
interested 0 149 70
in 0 149 70

diocese 0 149 75
it 0 149 75
never 0 149 75
happened 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
me, 0 149 75
but 0 149 75
a 0 149 75
bishop 0 149 75
called 0 149 75
me 0 149 75
once 0 149 75
by 0 149 75
phone 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
ask 0 149 75
me 0 149 75
what 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
do 0 149 75
in 0 149 75
a 0 149 75
situation 0 149 75
like 0 149 75
this.” 0 149 75
Francis 0 149 75
added 0 149 75
that 0 149 75
he 0 149 75
agreed 0 149 75
with 0 149 75
the 0 149 75
“zero 0 149 75
tolerance” 0 149 75
attitude 0 149 75
of 0 149 75
the 0 149 75
Irish 0 149 75
episcopate 0 149 75
and 0 149 75
admired 0 149 75
Pope 0 149 75
Benedict’s 0 149 75
reforms 0 149 75
– 0 149 75
most 0 149 75
of 0 149 75
which 0 149 75
he 0 149 75
was 0 149 75
later 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
quietly 0 149 75
reverse. 0 149 75

It 0 149 76
was 0 149 76
at 0 149 76
exactly 0 149 76
this 0 149 76
time, 0 149 76
however, 0 149 76
that 0 149 76
victims 0 149 76
from 0 149 76
Argentina 0 149 76
were 0 149 76
attempting 0 149 76
to 0 149 76
get 0 149 76
the 0 149 76
new 0 149 76
pope’s 0 149 76
attention. 0 149 76

One, 0 149 77
known 0 149 77
to 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
press 0 149 77
only 0 149 77
as 0 149 77
“Gabriel,” 0 149 77
wanted 0 149 77
to 0 149 77
talk 0 149 77
to 0 149 77
Francis 0 149 77
about 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
sexual 0 149 77
abuse 0 149 77
he 0 149 77
suffered 0 149 77
at 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
hands 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
Julio 0 149 77
César 0 149 77
Grassi, 0 149 77
accused 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
molesting 0 149 77
at 0 149 77
least 0 149 77
five 0 149 77
boys, 0 149 77
“who 0 149 77
has 0 149 77
been 0 149 77
avoiding 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
sentences 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
justice 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
Morón 0 149 77
and 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
Court 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
Cassation. 0 149 77

So 0 149 78
far, 0 149 78
judges 0 149 78
and 0 149 78
prosecutors 0 149 78
at 0 149 78
all 0 149 78
instances 0 149 78
found 0 149 78
him 0 149 78
guilty.” 0 149 78

In 0 149 79
case 0 149 79
anyone 0 149 79
thinks 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
Grassi-Gabriel 0 149 79
case 0 149 79
was 0 149 79
not 0 149 79
serious 0 149 79
enough 0 149 79
for 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
pope’s 0 149 79
attention, 0 149 79
Bishop 0 149 79
Accountability 0 149 79
summarises, 0 149 79
“A 0 149 79
year 0 149 79

of 0 149 79
Grassi’s 0 149 79
trial, 0 149 79
three 0 149 79
men 0 149 79
ransacked 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
survivor’s 0 149 79
apartment 0 149 79
and 0 149 79
beat 0 149 79
him.” 0 149 79
These 0 149 79
men 0 149 79
threatened 0 149 79
to 0 149 79
kill 0 149 79
him 0 149 79
if 0 149 79
he 0 149 79
did 0 149 79
not 0 149 79

his 0 149 79
testimony 0 149 79
and 0 149 79
quit 0 149 79

his 0 149 80

2009, 0 149 80
“Gabriel 0 149 80

his 0 149 80
attorney, 0 149 80
Juan 0 149 80
Pablo 0 149 80
Gallego, 0 149 80
brought 0 149 80
a 0 149 80
two-page 0 149 80

did 0 149 81
not 0 149 81
leave 0 149 81
the 0 149 81

The 0 149 82
group 0 149 82
surmises 0 149 82
that 0 149 82
it 0 149 82
was 0 149 82
Bergoglio’s 0 149 82
direct 0 149 82
intervention 0 149 82
with 0 149 82
judges 0 149 82
in 0 149 82
the 0 149 82
case 0 149 82
that 0 149 82
prevented 0 149 82
a 0 149 82
conviction 0 149 82
against 0 149 82
Grassi 0 149 82
for 0 149 82
so 0 149 82
long 0 149 82
and 0 149 82
delayed 0 149 82
his 0 149 82
sentencing 0 149 82
through 0 149 82
multiple 0 149 82
appeals. 0 149 82

In 0 149 83
2006, 0 149 83
then-Archbishop 0 149 83
Bergoglio 0 149 83
complained 0 149 83
of 0 149 83
a 0 149 83
“media 0 149 83
campaign” 0 149 83
and 0 149 83
claimed 0 149 83
that 0 149 83
the 0 149 83
Grassi 0 149 83
case 0 149 83
was 0 149 83
“different” 0 149 83
from 0 149 83
other 0 149 83
accusations. 0 149 83

During 0 149 84
his 0 149 84
criminal 0 149 84
trial 0 149 84
Grassi 0 149 84
said 0 149 84
Bergoglio 0 149 84
“never 0 149 84
let 0 149 84
go” 0 149 84
of 0 149 84
his 0 149 84
hand. 0 149 84

In 0 149 85
2009, 0 149 85
Grassi 0 149 85
was 0 149 85
convicted 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
two 0 149 85
counts 0 149 85
of 0 149 85

assault 0 149 85
and 0 149 85
corruption 0 149 85
in 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
case 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
“Gabriel,” 0 149 85
who 0 149 85
was 0 149 85
aged 0 149 85
13 0 149 85
at 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
time 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
abuse, 0 149 85
but 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
appeals 0 149 85
dragged 0 149 85
on 0 149 85
until 0 149 85
he 0 149 85
was 0 149 85
finally 0 149 85

more 0 149 86
similar 0 149 86
cases, 0 149 86
all 0 149 86
of 0 149 86
whom 0 149 86
were 0 149 86
rebuffed 0 149 86

their 0 149 86
attempts 0 149 86
to 0 149 86
meet 0 149 86
with 0 149 86
Bergoglio, 0 149 86
are 0 149 86
detailed 0 149 86
here, 0 149 86
for 1 149 86
the 1 149 86
strong-of-stomach. 1 149 86

A 1 149 87
virtuoso 1 149 87
performance-liar 1 149 87

Looking 0 149 88
back 0 149 88
and 0 149 88
carefully 0 149 88
examining 0 149 88
his 0 149 88
record, 0 149 88
Jorge 0 149 88
Bergoglio’s 0 149 88
mastery 1 149 88
of 0 149 88
using 0 149 88
the 0 149 88
weaknesses 0 149 88
of 0 149 88
morally 0 149 88
compromised 0 149 88
men 0 149 88
is 0 149 88
becoming 0 149 88
evident. 0 149 88

It 0 149 89
is 0 149 89
arguable 0 149 89
that 0 149 89
even 0 149 89
the 0 149 89
members 0 149 89
of 0 149 89
the 0 149 89
so-called 0 149 89
“San 0 149 89
Gallen 0 149 89
Mafia” 0 149 89
who 0 149 89
apparently 0 149 89
conspired 0 149 89
to 0 149 89
put 0 149 89
him 0 149 89
on 0 149 89
Peter’s 0 149 89
throne 0 149 89
were 0 149 89
used 0 149 89
by 0 149 89
him. 0 149 89

But 0 149 90
he 0 149 90
is 0 149 90
also 0 149 90
a 0 149 90
master 0 149 90
of 0 149 90
judging 0 149 90
an 0 149 90
audience 0 149 90
and 0 149 90
telling 0 149 90
them 0 149 90
what 0 149 90
they 0 149 90
expect 0 149 90
to 0 149 90
hear; 0 149 90
a 0 149 90
key 0 149 90
skill 0 149 90
for 0 149 90
all 0 149 90
grifters 0 149 90
and 0 149 90
confidence 0 149 90
tricksters. 0 149 90

Looking 0 149 91
carefully 0 149 91
at 0 149 91
the 0 149 91
infamous 0 149 91
“Who 0 149 91
am 0 149 91
I 0 149 91
to 0 149 91
judge” 0 149 91
comment, 0 149 91
this 0 149 91
was 0 149 91
clear 0 149 91
early 0 149 91
on. 0 149 91

The 0 149 92
first 0 149 92
part 0 149 92
of 0 149 92
that 0 149 92
interview 0 149 92
is 0 149 92
a 0 149 92
blatant 1 149 92
and 1 149 92
enormous 1 149 92
lie, 1 149 92
and 0 149 92
it 0 149 92
was 0 149 92
from 0 149 92
there 0 149 92
that 0 149 92
the 0 149 92
pope 0 149 92
moved 0 149 92
on 0 149 92
to 0 149 92
his 0 149 92
apology 0 149 92
for 0 149 92
homosexuality 0 149 92
in 0 149 92
general. 0 149 92

Recall 0 149 93
that 0 149 93
this 0 149 93
was 0 149 93
the 0 149 93
very 0 149 93
first 0 149 93
airplane 0 149 93
interview, 0 149 93
on 0 149 93
the 0 149 93
trip 0 149 93
back 0 149 93
to 0 149 93
Rome 0 149 93
from 0 149 93
World 0 149 93
Youth 0 149 93
Day 0 149 93
in 0 149 93
Rio, 0 149 93
a 0 149 93
matter 0 149 93
of 0 149 93
weeks 0 149 93
after 0 149 93
his 0 149 93
election. 0 149 93

At 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
time, 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
papal 1 149 94
apologists 1 149 94
sprang 0 149 94
instantly 0 149 94
into 0 149 94
action 0 149 94
and 0 149 94
we 0 149 94
heard 0 149 94
all 0 149 94
about 0 149 94
how 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
pope 0 149 94
was 0 149 94
talking 0 149 94
strictly 0 149 94
within 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
boundaries 0 149 94
of 0 149 94
Catholic 0 149 94
doctrine. 0 149 94

But 0 149 95
perhaps 0 149 95
in 0 149 95
hindsight, 0 149 95
we 0 149 95
are 0 149 95
ready 0 149 95
to 0 149 95
examine 0 149 95
the 0 149 95
full 0 149 95
implications 0 149 95
of 0 149 95
his 0 149 95
little 0 149 95
speech, 0 149 95
one 0 149 95
that 0 149 95
was 0 149 95
clearly 0 149 95
well-rehearsed. 0 149 95

(Don’t 0 149 96
forget, 0 149 96
no 0 149 96
question 0 149 96
is 0 149 96
asked 0 149 96
in 0 149 96
a 0 149 96
papal 0 149 96
interview 0 149 96
without 0 149 96
being 0 149 96
thoroughly 1 149 96
vetted 1 149 96
ahead 0 149 96
of 0 149 96
time. 0 149 96

Journalists 0 149 97
must 0 149 97
submit 0 149 97
their 0 149 97
questions 0 149 97
well 0 149 97
in 0 149 97
advance.) 0 149 97

This 0 149 98
was 0 149 98
the 0 149 98
pope 0 149 98
laying 0 149 98
out 0 149 98
his 0 149 98
policy 0 149 98
regarding 0 149 98
homosexuality, 0 149 98
a 0 149 98
policy 0 149 98
for 0 149 98
which 0 149 98
he 0 149 98
was 0 149 98
duly 1 149 98
rewarded 1 149 98
by 0 149 98
being 0 149 98
lauded 0 149 98
on 0 149 98
the 0 149 98
cover 0 149 98
of 0 149 98
the 0 149 98
homosexualist 0 149 98
lobby’s 0 149 98
US 0 149 98
trade 0 149 98
magazine. 0 149 98

Read 0 149 99
his 0 149 99
full 0 149 99
answer 0 149 99
carefully: 0 149 99

I 0 149 100
see 0 149 100
that 0 149 100
many 0 149 100
times 0 149 100
in 0 149 100
the 0 149 100
Church, 0 149 100
over 0 149 100
and 0 149 100
above 0 149 100
this 0 149 100
case, 0 149 100
but 0 149 100
including 0 149 100
this 0 149 100
case, 0 149 100
people 0 149 100
search 0 149 100
for 0 149 100
“sins 0 149 100
from 0 149 100
youth”, 0 149 100
for 0 149 100
example, 0 149 100
and 0 149 100
then 0 149 100
publish 0 149 100
them. 0 149 100

They 0 149 101
are 0 149 101
not 0 149 101
crimes, 0 149 101
right? 0 149 101

Crimes 0 149 102
are 0 149 102
something 0 149 102
different: 0 149 102
the 0 149 102
abuse 0 149 102
of 0 149 102
minors 0 149 102
is 0 149 102
a 0 149 102
crime. 0 149 102

No, 0 149 103
sins. 0 149 103

But 0 149 104
if 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
person, 0 149 104
whether 0 149 104
it 0 149 104
be 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
lay 0 149 104
person, 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
priest 0 149 104
or 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
religious 0 149 104
sister, 0 149 104
commits 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
sin 0 149 104
and 0 149 104
then 0 149 104
converts, 0 149 104
the 0 149 104
Lord 0 149 104
forgives, 0 149 104
and 0 149 104
when 0 149 104
the 0 149 104
Lord 0 149 104
forgives, 0 149 104
the 0 149 104
Lord 0 149 104
forgets 0 149 104
and 0 149 104
this 0 149 104
is 0 149 104
very 0 149 104
important 0 149 104
for 0 149 104
our 0 149 104
lives. 0 149 104

When 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
confess 0 149 105
our 0 149 105
sins 0 149 105
and 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
truly 0 149 105
say, 0 149 105
“I 0 149 105
have 0 149 105
sinned 0 149 105
in 0 149 105
this”, 0 149 105
the 0 149 105
Lord 0 149 105
forgets, 0 149 105
and 0 149 105
so 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
have 0 149 105
no 0 149 105
right 0 149 105
not 0 149 105
to 0 149 105
forget, 0 149 105
because 0 149 105
otherwise 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
would 0 149 105
run 0 149 105
the 0 149 105
risk 0 149 105
of 0 149 105
the 0 149 105
Lord 0 149 105
not 0 149 105
forgetting 0 149 105
our 0 149 105
sins. 0 149 105

That 1 149 106
is 1 149 106
a 1 149 106
danger. 1 149 106

This 0 149 107
is 0 149 107
important: 0 149 107
a 0 149 107
theology 0 149 107
of 0 149 107

sin. 0 149 108
Many 0 149 108
times 0 149 108
I 0 149 108
think 0 149 108
of 0 149 108
Saint 0 149 108
Peter. 0 149 108

He 0 149 109
committed 0 149 109
one 0 149 109
of 0 149 109
the 0 149 109
worst 0 149 109
sins, 0 149 109
that 0 149 109
is 0 149 109
he 0 149 109
denied 0 149 109
Christ, 0 149 109
and 0 149 109
even 0 149 109
with 0 149 109
this 0 149 109
sin 0 149 109
they 0 149 109
made 0 149 109
him 0 149 109
Pope. 0 149 109

We 0 149 110
have 0 149 110
to 0 149 110
think 0 149 110
a 0 149 110
great 0 149 110
deal 0 149 110
about 0 149 110
that. 0 149 110

But, 0 149 111
returning 0 149 111
to 0 149 111
your 0 149 111
question 0 149 111
more 0 149 111
concretely. 0 149 111

In 0 149 112
this 0 149 112
case, 0 149 112
I 0 149 112
conducted 0 149 112
the 0 149 112
preliminary 0 149 112
investigation 0 149 112
and 0 149 112
we 0 149 112
didn’t 0 149 112
find 0 149 112
anything. 0 149 112

This 0 149 113
is 0 149 113
the 0 149 113
first 0 149 113
question. 0 149 113

Then, 0 149 114
you 0 149 114
spoke 0 149 114
about 0 149 114
the 0 149 114
gay 0 149 114
lobby. 0 149 114

So 0 149 115
much 0 149 115
is 0 149 115
written 0 149 115
about 0 149 115
the 0 149 115
gay 0 149 115
lobby. 0 149 115

I 0 149 116
still 0 149 116
haven’t 0 149 116
found 0 149 116
anyone 0 149 116
with 0 149 116
an 0 149 116
identity 0 149 116
card 0 149 116
in 0 149 116
the 0 149 116
Vatican 0 149 116
with 0 149 116
“gay” 0 149 116
on 0 149 116

it. 0 149 117
They 0 149 117
say 0 149 117
there 0 149 117
are 0 149 117
some 0 149 117
there. 0 149 117

I 0 149 118
believe 0 149 118
that 0 149 118
when 0 149 118
you 0 149 118
are 0 149 118
dealing 0 149 118
with 0 149 118
such 0 149 118
a 0 149 118
person, 0 149 118
you 0 149 118
must 0 149 118
distinguish 0 149 118
between 0 149 118
the 0 149 118
fact 0 149 118
of 0 149 118
a 0 149 118
person 0 149 118
being 0 149 118
gay 0 149 118
and 0 149 118
the 0 149 118
fact 0 149 118
of 0 149 118
someone 0 149 118
forming 0 149 118
a 0 149 118
lobby, 0 149 118
because 0 149 118
not 0 149 118
all 0 149 118
lobbies 0 149 118
are 0 149 118

good. 0 149 119
This 0 149 119
one 0 149 119
is 0 149 119
not 0 149 119

good. 0 149 120
If 0 149 120
someone 0 149 120
is 0 149 120
gay 0 149 120
and 0 149 120
is 0 149 120
searching 0 149 120
for 0 149 120
the 0 149 120
Lord 0 149 120
and 0 149 120
has 0 149 120
good 0 149 120
will, 0 149 120
then 0 149 120
who 1 149 120
am 1 149 120
I 1 149 120
to 1 149 120
judge 1 149 120

him? 1 149 121
The 0 149 121
Catechism 0 149 121
of 0 149 121
the 0 149 121
Catholic 0 149 121
Church 0 149 121
explains 0 149 121
this 0 149 121
in 0 149 121
a 0 149 121
beautiful 0 149 121
way, 0 149 121
saying 0 149 121
... 0 149 121
wait 0 149 121
a 0 149 121
moment, 0 149 121
how 0 149 121
does 0 149 121
it 0 149 121
say 0 149 121
it 0 149 121
... 0 149 121
it 0 149 121
says: 0 149 121
“no 0 149 121
one 0 149 121
should 0 149 121
marginalize 0 149 121
these 0 149 121
people 0 149 121
for 0 149 121
this, 0 149 121
they 0 149 121
must 0 149 121
be 0 149 121
integrated 0 149 121
into 0 149 121
society”. 0 149 121

The 0 149 122
problem 0 149 122
is 0 149 122
not 0 149 122
having 0 149 122
this 0 149 122
tendency, 0 149 122
no, 0 149 122
we 0 149 122
must 0 149 122
be 0 149 122
brothers 0 149 122
and 0 149 122
sisters 0 149 122
to 0 149 122
one 0 149 122
another, 0 149 122
and 0 149 122
there 0 149 122
is 0 149 122
this 0 149 122
one 0 149 122
and 0 149 122
there 0 149 122
is 0 149 122
that 0 149 122

one. 0 149 123
The 0 149 123
problem 0 149 123
is 0 149 123
in 0 149 123
making 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
this 0 149 123
tendency: 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
misers, 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
politicians, 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
masons, 0 149 123
so 1 149 123
many 1 149 123
lobbies. 1 149 123

For 0 149 124
me, 0 149 124
this 0 149 124
is 0 149 124
the 0 149 124
greater 0 149 124
problem. 0 149 124

Thank 0 149 125
you 0 149 125
so 0 149 125
much 0 149 125
for 0 149 125
asking 0 149 125
this 0 149 125
question. 0 149 125

Many 0 149 126

thanks. 0 149 127
One 0 149 127
of 0 149 127
the 0 149 127
pope’s 0 149 127
favourite 0 149 127
rhetorical 0 149 127
techniques 0 149 127
is 0 149 127
a 0 149 127
combination 0 149 127
of 0 149 127
Begging 0 149 127
the 0 149 127
Question 0 149 127
and 0 149 127
conspiracy. 0 149 127

He 0 149 128
starts 0 149 128
by 0 149 128
assuming, 0 149 128
without 0 149 128
any 0 149 128
effort 0 149 128
at 0 149 128
defence 0 149 128
or 0 149 128
explanation, 0 149 128
a 0 149 128
point 0 149 128
that 0 149 128
concedes 0 149 128
the 0 149 128
whole 0 149 128

issue. 0 149 129
This 0 149 129
was 0 149 129
the 0 149 129
first 0 149 129
time 0 149 129
a 0 149 129
pope 0 149 129
had 0 149 129
ever 0 149 129
used 0 149 129
the 0 149 129
political 0 149 129
term 0 149 129

“gay”. 0 149 130
Not 0 149 130
“homosexual,” 0 149 130
not 0 149 130
“same-sex 0 149 130
attracted,” 0 149 130
but 0 149 130
“gay,” 0 149 130
meaning 0 149 130
that 0 149 130
he 0 149 130
started 0 149 130
by 0 149 130
adopting 0 149 130
the 0 149 130
entirety 0 149 130
of 0 149 130
the 0 149 130
homosexualist 0 149 130
movement’s 0 149 130
linguistic 0 149 130
manipulations. 0 149 130

Language 0 149 131
counts 0 149 131
in 0 149 131
politics, 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
a 0 149 131
pope 0 149 131
using 0 149 131
that 0 149 131
term 0 149 131
means 0 149 131
he 0 149 131
is 0 149 131
by 0 149 131
implication 0 149 131
starting 0 149 131
the 0 149 131
discussion 0 149 131
– 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
his 0 149 131
pontificate 0 149 131
– 0 149 131
by 0 149 131
aligning 0 149 131
himself 0 149 131
with 0 149 131
the 0 149 131
basic 0 149 131
tenets 0 149 131
of 0 149 131
a 0 149 131
movement 0 149 131
that 0 149 131
is 0 149 131
violently 1 149 131
opposed 1 149 131
to 0 149 131
Catholic 0 149 131
moral 0 149 131
teaching, 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
in 0 149 131
direct 0 149 131
opposition 0 149 131
to 0 149 131
his 0 149 131
immediate, 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
still 0 149 131
living, 0 149 131
predecessor. 0 149 131

In 0 149 132
this 0 149 132
case 0 149 132
too, 0 149 132
he 0 149 132
was 0 149 132
addressing 0 149 132
a 0 149 132
plane 0 149 132
load 0 149 132
of 0 149 132
journalists 0 149 132
who 0 149 132
were 0 149 132
either 0 149 132
secular 0 149 132
themselves, 0 149 132
or 0 149 132
for 0 149 132
the 0 149 132
most 0 149 132
part 0 149 132
are 0 149 132
the 0 149 132
kind 0 149 132
of 0 149 132
Catholic 0 149 132
who 0 149 132
believes 0 149 132
it 0 149 132
is 0 149 132
fine 0 149 132
to 0 149 132
“disagree” 0 149 132
with 0 149 132
Catholic 0 149 132
teaching 0 149 132
on 0 149 132
sexuality. 0 149 132

There 0 149 133
are 0 149 133
very 0 149 133
few 0 149 133
“conservative” 0 149 133
Catholics 0 149 133
in 0 149 133
the 0 149 133
Vatican 0 149 133
journalist 0 149 133

pool. 0 149 134
This 0 149 134
means 0 149 134
that 0 149 134
his 0 149 134
use 0 149 134
of 0 149 134
this 0 149 134
language 0 149 134
was 0 149 134
a 0 149 134
conspiratorial 0 149 134
wink 0 149 134
and 0 149 134
nod 0 149 134
to 0 149 134
his 0 149 134
immediate 0 149 134
audience, 0 149 134
a 0 149 134
sly 0 149 134
message 0 149 134
to 0 149 134
say, 0 149 134
“People 0 149 134
talk 0 149 134
all 0 149 134
the 0 149 134
time 0 149 134
about 0 149 134
a 0 149 134
gay 0 149 134
lobby, 0 149 134
but 0 149 134
you 0 149 134
and 0 149 134
I 0 149 134
both 0 149 134
know 0 149 134
this 0 149 134
is 0 149 134
mostly 0 149 134
nonsense, 1 149 134
propaganda 1 149 134
from 0 149 134
those 0 149 134
people… 0 149 134
those 0 149 134
conservatives…We 0 149 134
cool 1 149 134
and 1 149 134

do 1 149 135
we?” 1 149 135
This 0 149 135
astonishing 0 149 135
departure 0 149 135
follows 0 149 135
an 0 149 135
implied 0 149 135
but 0 149 135
very 0 149 135
clear 0 149 135
assertion 0 149 135
that 0 149 135
Ricca 0 149 135
has 0 149 135
repented 0 149 135
and 0 149 135
given 0 149 135
up 0 149 135
his 0 149 135

an 0 149 135
assertion 0 149 135
that 0 149 135

absolutely 0 149 135
no 0 149 135

to 0 149 135
back 0 149 135

it 0 149 136
up. 0 149 136
We 1 149 136
are 1 149 136
simply 1 149 136
asked 1 149 136
to 1 149 136
take 1 149 136
the 1 149 136
pope’s 1 149 136
word 1 149 136
for 1 149 136
it, 1 149 136
but 0 149 136
given 0 149 136
that 0 149 136

his 0 149 136
astoundingly 1 149 136
brazen 1 149 136
lie 1 149 136
that 0 149 136
there 0 149 136
was 0 149 136
no 0 149 136

in 0 149 136
the 0 149 136
first 0 149 136

we 0 149 136

it 0 149 136
seems 0 149 136
to 0 149 136

worth. 0 149 137
Next, 0 149 137
after 0 149 137
another 0 149 137
little 0 149 137
inside 0 149 137

about 0 149 137

– 0 149 137

(but 0 149 137
of 0 149 137
course 0 149 137
never 0 149 137
outright 0 149 137
saying) 0 149 137
that 0 149 137
the 0 149 137
whole 0 149 137
thing 0 149 137
is 0 149 137
hysterical 1 149 137
nonsense 1 149 137
– 0 149 137
we 0 149 137
hear 0 149 137
a 0 149 137
direct 0 149 137
contradiction 0 149 137
to 0 149 137
Catholic 0 149 137

no 0 149 137
less 0 149 137
a 0 149 137

his 0 149 137
predecessor, 0 149 137
Pope 0 149 137
Benedict 0 149 137
Ratzinger. 0 149 137

“The 0 149 138
problem 0 149 138
is 0 149 138
not 0 149 138
having 0 149 138
this 0 149 138
tendency.” 0 149 138
Well, 0 149 138
actually, 0 149 138
your 0 149 138
holiness, 0 149 138
yes 0 149 138
it 0 149 138
is, 0 149 138
particularly 0 149 138
in 0 149 138
the 0 149 138
case 0 149 138
of 0 149 138
priests. 0 149 138

The 0 149 139
“tendency” 0 149 139
is 0 149 139
called 0 149 139
in 0 149 139
the 0 149 139
same 0 149 139
catechism 0 149 139
you 0 149 139
quote 0 149 139
“intrinsically 1 149 139
disordered” 1 149 139
and 0 149 139
Ratzinger 0 149 139
was 0 149 139
very 0 149 139
clear 0 149 139
that 0 149 139
this 0 149 139
“tendency” 0 149 139
is 0 149 139
a 0 149 139
sign 0 149 139
of 0 149 139
a 1 149 139
serious 1 149 139
emotional 1 149 139
dysfunction 1 149 139
that 1 149 139
“must” 1 149 139
preclude 1 149 139
a 1 149 139
man 1 149 139

A 0 149 141
few 0 149 141
months 0 149 141
ago 0 149 141
in 0 149 141
a 0 149 141
piece 0 149 141
for 0 149 141
the 0 149 141
Remnant, 0 149 141
I 0 149 141
talked 0 149 141
about 0 149 141
why 0 149 141
the 0 149 141
Church 0 149 141
(and 0 149 141
nearly 0 149 141
all 0 149 141
human 0 149 141
societies) 0 149 141
regard 0 149 141
lying 0 149 141
as 0 149 141

a 0 149 142
sin: 0 149 142
A 0 149 142
mistake 0 149 142
many 0 149 142
make 0 149 142
about 0 149 142
lying 0 149 142
is 0 149 142
to 0 149 142
understand 0 149 142
it 0 149 142
only 0 149 142
in 0 149 142
terms 0 149 142
of 0 149 142
morality. 0 149 142

But 0 149 143
Thomas 0 149 143
makes 0 149 143
the 0 149 143
point 0 149 143
that 0 149 143
it 0 149 143
is 0 149 143
first 0 149 143
a 0 149 143
matter 0 149 143
of 0 149 143
metaphysics. 0 149 143

Lying 0 149 144
is 0 149 144
an 0 149 144
act 0 149 144
at 0 149 144
variance 0 149 144
in 0 149 144
its 0 149 144
essence 0 149 144
with 0 149 144
the 0 149 144
nature 0 149 144
of 0 149 144
reality. 0 149 144

Thomistic 0 149 145
theology 0 149 145
teaches 0 149 145
that 0 149 145
it 0 149 145
is 0 149 145
by 0 149 145
lying 0 149 145
that 0 149 145
we 0 149 145
become 0 149 145
most 0 149 145
like 0 149 145
the 0 149 145
devil, 0 149 145
and 0 149 145
most 0 149 145
unlike 0 149 145
God, 0 149 145
because 0 149 145
we 0 149 145
are 0 149 145
trying 0 149 145
to 0 149 145
change 0 149 145
the 0 149 145
nature 0 149 145
of 0 149 145
reality 0 149 145
to 0 149 145
suit 0 149 145
our 0 149 145
own 0 149 145
purposes. 0 149 145

Habitual 0 149 146
lying 0 149 146
in 0 149 146
effect 0 149 146
changes 0 149 146
you 0 149 146
into 0 149 146
a 0 149 146
different 0 149 146
kind 0 149 146
of 0 149 146
being, 0 149 146
one 0 149 146
that 0 149 146
is 0 149 146
by 0 149 146
nature 0 149 146
an 0 149 146
opponent 0 149 146
of 0 149 146
Truth, 0 149 146
ordered 0 149 146
against 0 149 146

Truth. 0 149 147
This 0 149 147
of 0 149 147
course 0 149 147
means 0 149 147
that 0 149 147
a 0 149 147
person 0 149 147
whose 0 149 147
“orientation,” 0 149 147
as 0 149 147
we 0 149 147
might 0 149 147
say, 0 149 147
is 0 149 147
towards 0 149 147
falsehood, 0 149 147
even 0 149 147
when 0 149 147
he 0 149 147
is 0 149 147
at 0 149 147
any 0 149 147
given 0 149 147
moment 0 149 147
saying 0 149 147
something 0 149 147
true, 0 149 147
is 0 149 147
still 0 149 147
servicing 0 149 147
his 0 149 147

lies. 0 149 148
He 0 149 148
tells 0 149 148
the 0 149 148
truth 0 149 148
only 0 149 148
to 0 149 148
continue 0 149 148
to 0 149 148
control 0 149 148
and 0 149 148
manipulate 0 149 148
reality. 0 149 148

It 0 149 149
was 0 149 149
not 0 149 149
by 0 149 149
violence, 0 149 149
but 0 149 149
by 0 149 149
lying 0 149 149
and 0 149 149
manipulation, 0 149 149
by 0 149 149
issuing 0 149 149
half-truths 0 149 149
and 0 149 149
pretending 0 149 149
to 0 149 149
be 0 149 149
the 0 149 149
kind 0 149 149
of 0 149 149
man 0 149 149
he 0 149 149
was 0 149 149
not, 0 149 149
that 0 149 149
Shakespeare’s 0 149 149
character 0 149 149
Iago 0 149 149
earned 0 149 149
the 0 149 149
title 0 149 149
of 0 149 149
most 0 149 149
evil 0 149 149
character 0 149 149
in 0 149 149
English 0 149 149
literature. 0 149 149

Human 0 149 150
beings 0 149 150
are 0 149 150
naturally 0 149 150
ordered 0 149 150
towards 0 149 150
the 0 149 150
truth, 0 149 150
and 0 149 150
we 0 149 150
have 0 149 150
to 0 149 150
work 0 149 150
at 0 149 150
assuming 0 149 150

a 0 149 151
lie. 0 149 151
This 0 149 151
is 0 149 151
why 0 149 151
confidence 0 149 151
tricksters 0 149 151
can 0 149 151
be 0 149 151
successful, 0 149 151
why 0 149 151
lying 0 149 151
works 0 149 151
for 0 149 151
getting 0 149 151
what 0 149 151
you 0 149 151
want; 0 149 151
people 0 149 151
don’t 0 149 151
see 0 149 151
it 0 149 151

coming. 0 149 152
The 0 149 152
first 0 149 152
natural 0 149 152
assumption 0 149 152
is 0 149 152
trust, 0 149 152
at 0 149 152
least 0 149 152
at 0 149 152
the 0 149 152
basic 0 149 152
level 0 149 152
of 0 149 152
expecting 0 149 152
truth 0 149 152
most 0 149 152
of 0 149 152
the 0 149 152

time. 0 149 153
We 0 149 153
therefore 0 149 153
instinctively 0 149 153
see 0 149 153
lying 0 149 153
as 0 149 153
a 0 149 153
betrayal 0 149 153
of 0 149 153

trust. 0 149 154
Considering 0 149 154
how 0 149 154
much 0 149 154
trust 0 149 154
the 0 149 154
Catholic 0 149 154
faithful 0 149 154
had 0 149 154
in 0 149 154
the 0 149 154
papacy 0 149 154
until 0 149 154
about 0 149 154
1965, 0 149 154
how 0 149 154
much 0 149 154
un-earned 0 149 154
trust 0 149 154
Francis 0 149 154
started 0 149 154
with 0 149 154
just 0 149 154
by 0 149 154
being 0 149 154
elected, 0 149 154
this 0 149 154
pontificate 0 149 154
should 0 149 154
be 0 149 154
remembered 0 149 154
as 0 149 154
one 1 149 154
of 1 149 154
the 1 149 154
great 1 149 154
confidence 1 149 154

in 0 149 154
history. 0 149 154

Believing 0 149 155
Catholics 0 149 155
have 0 149 155
watched 1 149 155
aghast 1 149 155
as 0 149 155
this 0 149 155
pope 0 149 155
has 0 149 155
habitually 0 149 155
trampled 0 149 155
on 0 149 155
every 0 149 155
aspect 0 149 155
of 0 149 155
Catholic 0 149 155
teaching. 0 149 155

Sandro 0 149 156
Magister 0 149 156

a 0 149 156
piece 0 149 156
on 0 149 156
his 0 149 156
website 0 149 156
that 0 149 156
listed 0 149 156
in 0 149 156
dizzying 1 149 156
detail 1 149 156
the 0 149 156
many 0 149 156
times, 0 149 156
in 0 149 156
only 0 149 156
the 0 149 156
last 0 149 156
few 0 149 156
months, 0 149 156
that 0 149 156
pope 0 149 156

has 0 149 156
falsified 0 149 156
with 0 149 156
obvious 0 149 156
intention, 0 149 156
the 0 149 156
words 0 149 156
of 0 149 156
Christ 0 149 156
in 0 149 156
Scripture 0 149 156
and 0 149 156
the 0 149 156
teaching 0 149 156
of 0 149 156
the 0 149 156

Church. 0 149 157
Of 0 149 157
course 0 149 157
this 0 149 157
would 0 149 157
be 0 149 157
of 0 149 157
little 0 149 157
interest 0 149 157
to 0 149 157
secular 1 149 157
journalists, 1 149 157
who 0 149 157
have 0 149 157
paid 0 149 157
no 0 149 157
mind 0 149 157
to 0 149 157
his 0 149 157
habit 0 149 157
of 0 149 157
rewriting 0 149 157
Catholicism, 0 149 157

the 0 149 157
sex 0 149 157

is 0 149 157
something 0 149 157
secular 1 149 157

are 0 149 157
very 0 149 157

a 0 149 157

It 0 149 158
is 0 149 158
now 0 149 158
irrefutable 0 149 158
that 0 149 158

Sociologists 0 149 159
talk 0 149 159
about 0 149 159
the 0 149 159
concept 0 149 159
of 0 149 159
the 0 149 159
“high 0 149 159
trust 0 149 159
society,” 0 149 159
one 0 149 159
in 0 149 159
which 0 149 159
citizens 0 149 159
believe 0 149 159
what 0 149 159
they 0 149 159
are 0 149 159
told 0 149 159
by 0 149 159
the 0 149 159
elites 0 149 159
and 0 149 159
trust 0 149 159
them 0 149 159
to 0 149 159
govern 0 149 159
and 0 149 159
protect 0 149 159
them 0 149 159
adequately. 0 149 159

They 1 149 160
warn 1 149 160
that 1 149 160
the 1 149 160
general 1 149 160
loss 1 149 160
of 1 149 160
trust 1 149 160
in 1 149 160
institutions 1 149 160
leads 1 149 160
to 1 149 160
a 1 149 160
general 1 149 160
state 1 149 160
of 1 149 160
chaos, 1 149 160
in 1 149 160
which 1 149 160
laws 1 149 160
on 1 149 160
the 1 149 160
books 1 149 160
matter 1 149 160
little 1 149 160
as 1 149 160
citizens 1 149 160
turn 1 149 160
to 1 149 160
their 1 149 160
last 1 149 160
resort 1 149 160
of 1 149 160
protecting 1 149 160
themselves 1 149 160
and 1 149 160
their 1 149 160
own 1 149 160
families. 1 149 160

This 0 149 161
is 0 149 161
the 0 149 161
way 0 149 161
societies 0 149 161
disintegrate. 0 149 161

It 0 149 162
has 0 149 162
been 0 149 162
said 0 149 162
many 0 149 162
times 0 149 162
that 0 149 162
the 0 149 162
sex 0 149 162

has 0 149 162

this 0 149 162
is 0 149 162

true. 0 149 163
With 0 149 163
a 0 149 163

trickster 1 149 163
on 0 149 163
the 0 149 163
papal 0 149 163
throne, 0 149 163

using 1 149 163
lies 1 149 163
and 1 149 163
manipulation 1 149 163
to 0 149 163
maintain 0 149 163

radical 0 149 163
variance 0 149 163
with 0 149 163

before 0 149 163
that 0 149 163

occurs? 0 149 164

of 0 149 167
it? 0 149 167
I 0 149 167
have 0 149 167
seen 0 149 167
a 0 149 167
veritable 0 149 167
chorus 0 149 167
of 0 149 167
Catholics 0 149 167
on 0 149 167
social 0 149 167
media 0 149 167
declaring 0 149 167
that 0 149 167
if 1 149 167
Paul 1 149 167
VI 1 149 167
is 1 149 167
canonised, 1 149 167
their 1 149 167
loss 1 149 167
of 1 149 167
faith 1 149 167
in 1 149 167

Church 1 149 167
as 1 149 167
an 1 149 167
institution 1 149 167
will 1 149 167
be 1 149 167
complete. 1 149 167

I 0 149 168
am 0 149 168
told 0 149 168
from 0 149 168
contacts 0 149 168
inside 0 149 168
the 0 149 168
Vatican 0 149 168

to 0 149 168
Chile 0 149 168
Bergoglio’s 0 149 168

has 0 149 168
completely 0 149 168
dried 0 149 168

up. 0 149 169
He 0 149 169
has 0 149 169
no 0 149 169

to 0 149 169

himself 0 149 169

that 0 149 169
perhaps 0 149 169

his 0 149 169

the 0 149 169
desired 0 149 169
effect 0 149 169
of 0 149 169
terrorising 1 149 169

even 0 149 170
a 0 149 170
“conservative” 0 149 170
Catholic, 0 149 170
echoed 0 149 170
this 0 149 170
concern, 0 149 170
saying 0 149 170
the 0 149 170
Barros 0 149 170
affair 0 149 170
has 0 149 170
“definitely 0 149 170

find 0 149 171
it 0 149 171
very 0 149 171
difficult 0 149 171
now…and 0 149 171
cannot 0 149 171
understand 0 149 171
and 0 149 171
cannot 0 149 171
believe 0 149 171
that 0 149 171
this 0 149 171

It 0 149 172
may 0 149 172
seem 0 149 172
like 0 149 172
a 0 149 172
moment 0 149 172

in 0 149 172
reality 0 149 172
this 0 149 172

is 0 149 172
potentially 0 149 172
very 0 149 172
harmful 0 149 172
for 0 149 172
souls 0 149 172

the 0 149 172
long 0 149 172

There 0 149 173
is 0 149 173
a 0 149 173

This 0 149 181
is 0 149 181
common 0 149 181
in 0 149 181
Italian 0 149 181
journalism 0 149 181
that 0 149 181
has 0 149 181
somewhat 0 149 181
different 0 149 181
standards 0 149 181
from 0 149 181
that 0 149 181
of 0 149 181

picture 0 149 182
of 0 149 182
what’s 0 149 182
going 0 149 182
on, 0 149 182
where 0 149 182
Anglo-Saxons 0 149 182
are 0 149 182
considered 0 149 182
weirdly 0 149 182

the 0 149 183
pope, 0 149 183
Marie 0 149 183

what 0 150 1
is 0 150 1
being 0 150 1

a 0 150 1

a 0 150 2
“Grand 0 150 2

for 0 150 2

very 0 150 2
long 0 150 2
time. 0 150 2

The 0 150 3
Sun 0 150 3
might 0 150 3
look 0 150 3
the 0 150 3
same 0 150 3
to 0 150 3
you 0 150 3
today 0 150 3
as 0 150 3
it 0 150 3
has 0 150 3
since 0 150 3
the 0 150 3
first 0 150 3
time 0 150 3
you 0 150 3
laid 0 150 3
eyes 0 150 3
on 0 150 3
it, 0 150 3
but 0 150 3
our 0 150 3
star 0 150 3
actually 0 150 3
displays 0 150 3
plenty 0 150 3
of 0 150 3
changes. 0 150 3

The 0 150 4
Sun 0 150 4
goes 0 150 4
through 0 150 4
regular 0 150 4
cycles 0 150 4
of 0 150 4
solar 0 150 4
minimums 0 150 4
and 0 150 4
solar 0 150 4
maximums, 0 150 4
which 0 150 4
are 0 150 4
periods 0 150 4
where 0 150 4
the 0 150 4
Sun 0 150 4
is 0 150 4
either 0 150 4
quite 0 150 4
calm 0 150 4
(the 0 150 4
minimum) 0 150 4
or 0 150 4
incredibly 0 150 4
active 0 150 4
(the 0 150 4
maximum). 0 150 4

These 0 150 5
patterns 0 150 5
repeat 0 150 5
every 0 150 5
11 0 150 5
years 0 150 5
or 0 150 5
so, 0 150 5
but 0 150 5
new 0 150 5
research 0 150 5
suggests 0 150 5
that 0 150 5
there’s 0 150 5
a 0 150 5
pattern 0 150 5
behind 0 150 5
the 0 150 5
pattern, 0 150 5
and 0 150 5
that 0 150 5
a 0 150 5
particularly 0 150 5
cool 0 150 5
solar 0 150 5
minimum 0 150 5

on 0 150 5
the 0 150 5
way. 0 150 5

The 0 150 6
study, 0 150 6
which 0 150 6
was 0 150 6
published 0 150 6
in 0 150 6
Astrophysical 0 150 6
Journal 0 150 6
Letters, 0 150 6
was 0 150 6
carried 0 150 6
out 0 150 6
by 0 150 6
a 0 150 6
team 0 150 6

After 0 150 7
combing 0 150 7
the 0 150 7
data, 0 150 7
Lubin’s 0 150 7
team 0 150 7
has 0 150 7
forecasted 0 150 7
a 0 150 7
grand 0 150 7
minimum 0 150 7
that 0 150 7
will 0 150 7
be 0 150 7
around 0 150 7
seven 0 150 7
percent 0 150 7
cooler 0 150 7
than 0 150 7
the 0 150 7
typical 0 150 7
solar 0 150 7
minimum, 0 150 7
making 0 150 7
it 0 150 7
a 0 150 7
particularly 0 150 7
calm 0 150 7
moment 0 150 7
for 0 150 7
our 0 150 7
star. 0 150 7

During 0 150 8
a 0 150 8
solar 0 150 8
minimum, 0 150 8
the 0 150 8
Sun 0 150 8
produces 0 150 8
far 0 150 8
fewer 0 150 8
solar 0 150 8
flares 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
sunspots, 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
as 0 150 8
a 0 150 8
result, 0 150 8
much 0 150 8
less 0 150 8
ultraviolet 0 150 8
radiation 0 150 8
is 0 150 8
shot 0 150 8
out 0 150 8
into 0 150 8
space 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
towards 0 150 8
Earth. 0 150 8

This 0 150 9
can 0 150 9
have 0 150 9
a 0 150 9
number 0 150 9
of 0 150 9
effects 0 150 9
on 0 150 9
our 0 150 9
planet, 0 150 9
including 0 150 9
changes 0 150 9
in 0 150 9
the 0 150 9
thickness 0 150 9
of 0 150 9
the 0 150 9
stratospheric 0 150 9
ozone 0 150 9
layer 0 150 9
and 0 150 9
temperatures 0 150 9
far 0 150 9
above 0 150 9
ground. 0 150 9

Those 0 150 10
changes 0 150 10
can 0 150 10
affect 0 150 10
weather, 0 150 10
though 0 150 10
forecasting 0 150 10
specific 0 150 10
differences 0 150 10
has 0 150 10
proven 0 150 10
difficult. 0 150 10

The 0 150 11
grand 0 150 11
minimum 0 150 11
will 0 150 11
be 0 150 11
an 0 150 11
exaggerated 0 150 11
version 0 150 11
of 0 150 11
the 0 150 11
typical 0 150 11
solar 0 150 11
minimum, 0 150 11
and 0 150 11
could 0 150 11
produce 0 150 11
some 0 150 11
very 0 150 11
noticeable 0 150 11
effects. 0 150 11

The 0 150 12
most 0 150 12
recent 0 150 12
grand 0 150 12
minimum 0 150 12
is 0 150 12
thought 0 150 12
to 0 150 12
have 0 150 12
occurred 0 150 12
back 0 150 12
in 0 150 12
the 0 150 12
mid 0 150 12
1600s. 0 150 12

The 0 150 13
event, 0 150 13
called 0 150 13
the 0 150 13
Maunder 0 150 13
Minimum, 0 150 13
is 0 150 13
credited 0 150 13
with 0 150 13
plunging 0 150 13
temperatures 0 150 13
to 0 150 13
the 0 150 13
point 0 150 13
where 0 150 13
the 0 150 13
Thames 0 150 13
River 0 150 13
and 0 150 13
Baltic 0 150 13
Sea 0 150 13
froze 0 150 13
over. 0 150 13

However, 0 150 14
other 0 150 14
parts 0 150 14
of 0 150 14
the 0 150 14
planet 0 150 14
heated 0 150 14
up, 0 150 14
including 0 150 14
Alaska 0 150 14
and 0 150 14
Greenland, 0 150 14
to 0 150 14
far 0 150 14
above 0 150 14
their 0 150 14
normal 0 150 14

This 0 150 14

temporary 0 150 14

shakeup 0 150 14

of 0 150 14

temperatures 0 150 14

could 0 150 14

happen 0 150 14

again, 0 150 14

though 0 150 14

the 0 150 14

it 1 150 14

will 1 150 14

away 0 152 22

In 0 152 25
December, 0 152 25
he 0 152 25

that 0 152 25
he 0 152 25
was 0 152 25

PM 0 152 26

that 0 152 28

not 0 152 28
allow 0 152 28

on 0 23 1
the 0 23 1
Eucharist, 0 23 1
“Mysterium 0 23 1
Fidei,” 0 23 1
was 0 23 1
the 0 23 1
first 0 23 1
place 0 23 1
I 0 23 1
saw 0 23 1
anyone 0 23 1
say 0 23 1
that 0 23 1
the 0 23 1
body 0 23 1

soul 0 23 1

complete 0 23 1

the 0 23 2

had 0 23 2
naturally 0 23 2
never 0 23 2
heard 0 23 2
anything 0 23 2
at 0 23 2
all 0 23 2
about 0 23 2
the 0 23 2

The 0 23 3

believed 0 23 3
what 0 23 3
they 0 23 3
believe 0 23 3
about 0 23 3
it 0 23 3
came 0 23 3
as 0 23 3
a 0 23 3
bit 0 23 3
of 0 23 3
a 0 23 3
shock. 0 23 3

With 0 23 5
the 0 23 5
hindsight 0 23 5
of 0 23 5
52 0 23 5
years 0 23 5
and 0 23 5
a 0 23 5
great 0 23 5

of 0 23 5
very 1 23 5
dirty 1 23 5
and 1 23 5
unappealing 1 23 5
water 1 23 5
under 1 23 5
the 1 23 5
Catholic 1 23 5

we 0 23 5
can 0 23 5
see 0 23 5
it 0 23 5
as 0 23 5
a 0 23 5
kind 0 23 5
of 0 23 5
warning 0 23 5
prophecy. 0 23 5

Published 0 23 6
just 0 23 6
three 0 23 6
months 0 23 6
before 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
close 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
Vatican 0 23 6
II 0 23 6
and 0 23 6
just 0 23 6
as 0 23 6
Annibale 0 23 6
Bugnini 0 23 6
was 0 23 6
cranking 0 23 6
open 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
floodgates 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
his 0 23 6
never-ending 0 23 6
stream 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
liturgical 0 23 6
alterations, 0 23 6
Mysterium 0 23 6
Fidei 0 23 6
is 0 23 6
now 0 23 6
an 0 23 6
important 0 23 6
marker 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
a 0 23 6
critical 0 23 6
turning 0 23 6
point 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
Catholic 0 23 6
history, 0 23 6
perhaps 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
most 0 23 6
important 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
modern 0 23 6
times. 0 23 6

Who 1 23 7
can 1 23 7
read 1 23 7
this 1 23 7
without 1 23 7
cringing 1 23 7
at 1 23 7
what 1 23 7
we 1 23 7
now 1 23 7
know 1 23 7
was 1 23 7
about 1 23 7
to 1 23 7
happen: 1 23 7

Therefore, 0 23 8
we 0 23 8
earnestly 0 23 8
hope 0 23 8
that 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
restored 0 23 8
sacred 0 23 8
liturgy 0 23 8
will 0 23 8
bring 0 23 8
forth 0 23 8
abundant 0 23 8
fruits 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
eucharistic 0 23 8
devotion, 0 23 8
so 0 23 8
that 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
Holy 0 23 8
Church, 0 23 8
under 0 23 8
this 0 23 8
saving 0 23 8
sign 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
piety, 0 23 8
may 0 23 8
make 0 23 8
daily 0 23 8
progress 0 23 8
toward 0 23 8
perfect 0 23 8
unity 0 23 8
and 0 23 8
may 0 23 8
invite 0 23 8
all 0 23 8
Christians 0 23 8
to 0 23 8
a 0 23 8
unity 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
faith 0 23 8
and 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
love, 0 23 8
drawing 0 23 8
them 0 23 8
gently, 0 23 8
thanks 0 23 8
to 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
action 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
divine 0 23 8
grace. 0 23 8

But 0 23 9
in 0 23 9
1983 0 23 9
at 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
start 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
my 0 23 9
personal 0 23 9
investigations 0 23 9
into 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
Catholic 0 23 9
religion, 0 23 9
I 0 23 9
knew 0 23 9
nothing 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
any 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
that. 0 23 9

The 0 23 10
encyclical, 0 23 10
the 0 23 10
very 0 23 10
first 0 23 10
I 0 23 10
ever 0 23 10
read, 0 23 10
was 0 23 10
also 0 23 10
a 0 23 10
marker 0 23 10
for 0 23 10
me 0 23 10
of 0 23 10
a 0 23 10
personal 0 23 10
turning 0 23 10
point. 0 23 10

It 0 23 11
was 0 23 11
the 0 23 11
first 0 23 11
time 0 23 11
I 0 23 11
had 0 23 11
ever 0 23 11
seen 0 23 11
Catholic 0 23 11
eucharistic 0 23 11
doctrine 0 23 11
clearly 0 23 11
and 0 23 11
– 0 23 11
most 0 23 11
importantly 0 23 11
– 0 23 11
unapologetically 0 23 11
stated. 0 23 11

It 0 23 12
came 0 23 12
right 0 23 12
out 0 23 12
and 0 23 12
said 0 23 12
something 0 23 12
so 0 23 12
astounding, 0 23 12
something 0 23 12
so 0 23 12
completely 0 23 12
unlikely, 0 23 12
that 0 23 12
I 0 23 12
had 0 23 12
to 0 23 12
admit 0 23 12
that 0 23 12
it 0 23 12
left 0 23 12
very 0 23 12
few 0 23 12
logical 0 23 12
possibilities. 0 23 12

Like 0 23 13
C.S. 0 23 13

Lewis’s 0 23 14
assessment 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
claims 0 23 14
by 0 23 14
Christ 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
His 0 23 14
own 0 23 14
divinity, 0 23 14
this 0 23 14
pope 0 23 14
was 0 23 14
either 0 23 14
mad, 0 23 14
bad 0 23 14
or 0 23 14
telling 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
plain 0 23 14
truth. 0 23 14

Something 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
may 0 23 15
be 0 23 15
much 0 23 15
more 0 23 15
noteworthy 0 23 15
now 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
our 0 23 15
current 0 23 15
circumstances 0 23 15
than 0 23 15
it 0 23 15
was 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
year 0 23 15
I 0 23 15
read 0 23 15
it, 0 23 15
is 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
pope’s 0 23 15
very 0 23 15
first 0 23 15
quote 0 23 15
was 0 23 15
not 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
scripture, 0 23 15
but 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
Council 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
Trent: 0 23 15

“At 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Last 0 23 16
Supper, 0 23 16
on 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
night 0 23 16
He 0 23 16
was 0 23 16
handed 0 23 16
over, 0 23 16
Our 0 23 16
Lord 0 23 16
instituted 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Eucharistic 0 23 16
Sacrifice 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
Body 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
Blood, 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
perpetuate 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
sacrifice 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
cross 0 23 16
throughout 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
ages 0 23 16
until 0 23 16
He 0 23 16
should 0 23 16
come, 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
thus 0 23 16
entrust 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Church, 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
beloved 0 23 16
spouse, 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
memorial 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
death 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
resurrection: 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
sacrament 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
devotion, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
sign 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
unity, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
bond 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
charity, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
paschal 0 23 16
banquet 0 23 16
in 0 23 16
which 0 23 16
Christ 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
received, 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
soul 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
filled 0 23 16
with 0 23 16
grace 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
there 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
given 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
us 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
pledge 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
future 0 23 16
glory.” 0 23 16

In 0 23 17
these 0 23 17
words 0 23 17
are 0 23 17
highlighted 0 23 17
both 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
sacrifice, 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
pertains 0 23 17
to 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
essence 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Mass 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
is 0 23 17
celebrated 0 23 17
daily, 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
sacrament 0 23 17
in 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
faithful 0 23 17
participate 0 23 17
in 0 23 17
Holy 0 23 17
Communion 0 23 17
by 0 23 17
eating 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Flesh 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
Christ 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
drinking 0 23 17
His 0 23 17
Blood, 0 23 17
receiving 0 23 17
both 0 23 17
grace, 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
beginning 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
eternal 0 23 17
life, 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
medicine 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
immortality. 0 23 17

I 0 23 18
remember 0 23 18
my 0 23 18
thoughts 0 23 18
upon 0 23 18
reading 0 23 18
this 0 23 18
shocking 0 23 18
statement… 0 23 18
“By 0 23 18
doing 0 23 18
what? 0 23 18

!” 0 23 19

My 0 23 20
acceptance 0 23 20
from 0 23 20
the 0 23 20
reading 0 23 20
of 0 23 20
this 0 23 20
document 0 23 20
of 0 23 20
the 0 23 20
Church’s 0 23 20
orthodox 0 23 20
eucharistic 0 23 20
doctrine 0 23 20
was 0 23 20
based 0 23 20
in 0 23 20
part 0 23 20
on 0 23 20
Pope 1 23 20
Paul’s 1 23 20
gracious 1 23 20
and 1 23 20
beautiful 1 23 20
exposition, 1 23 20
and 1 23 20
in 1 23 20
part 1 23 20
on 1 23 20
the 1 23 20
sheer 1 23 20
radical, 1 23 20
mad 1 23 20
unlikeliness 1 23 20
of 1 23 20

it. 1 23 21
What 0 23 21
could 0 23 21
conceivably 0 23 21
be 0 23 21
the 0 23 21
reason 0 23 21
to 0 23 21
say 0 23 21
anything 0 23 21
as 0 23 21
wild 0 23 21
as 0 23 21
this 0 23 21
if 0 23 21
it 0 23 21
weren’t 0 23 21
true? 0 23 21

The 1 23 22
idea 1 23 22
of 1 23 22
transubstantiation 1 23 22
struck 1 23 22
me 1 23 22
as 1 23 22
I 1 23 22
read 1 23 22
that 1 23 22
document 1 23 22
as 1 23 22
possibly 1 23 22
the 1 23 22
strangest 1 23 22
and 1 23 22
most 1 23 22
earth 1 23 22
shattering 1 23 22
thing 1 23 22
I’d 1 23 22
ever 1 23 22
heard. 1 23 22

It 1 23 23
shocked 1 23 23
me 1 23 23
out 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
a 1 23 23
kind 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
swamp 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
intellectual 1 23 23
worldliness; 1 23 23
presenting 1 23 23
the 1 23 23
idea 1 23 23
to 1 23 23
my 1 23 23
thirsty 1 23 23
mind 1 23 23
that 1 23 23
there 1 23 23
could 1 23 23
indeed 1 23 23
be 1 23 23
fantastic 1 23 23
realities 1 23 23
far 1 23 23
more 1 23 23
wonderful 1 23 23
than 1 23 23
the 1 23 23
banal 1 23 23
and 1 23 23
painfully 1 23 23
uninteresting 1 23 23
secularist 1 23 23
worldview 1 23 23
I 1 23 23
had 1 23 23
been 1 23 23
taught 1 23 23
to 1 23 23
accept. 1 23 23

It 1 23 24
was 1 23 24
as 1 23 24
though 1 23 24
someone 1 23 24
had 1 23 24
plausibly 1 23 24
told 1 23 24
me 1 23 24
that, 1 23 24
yes, 1 23 24
there 1 23 24
were 1 23 24
fairies 1 23 24
and 1 23 24
magical 1 23 24
kingdoms 1 23 24
in 1 23 24
real 1 23 24
life, 1 23 24
“just 1 23 24
around 1 23 24
the 1 23 24
corner”. 1 23 24

By 0 23 25
the 0 23 25
time 0 23 25
I 0 23 25
read 0 23 25
it, 0 23 25
I 0 23 25
had 0 23 25
been 0 23 25
through 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
long, 0 23 25
slow 0 23 25
transition 0 23 25
from 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
childhood 0 23 25
devoted 0 23 25
to 0 23 25
Our 0 23 25
Lady 0 23 25
and 0 23 25
confirmed 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
my 0 23 25
belief 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
wonders, 0 23 25
to 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
kind 0 23 25
of 0 23 25
disappointed 0 23 25
practical 0 23 25
atheism 0 23 25
after 0 23 25
three 0 23 25
years 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
diocesan 0 23 25
Catholic 0 23 25
parochial 0 23 25
school. 0 23 25

I 0 23 26
had 0 23 26
been 0 23 26
taught, 0 23 26
by 0 23 26
both 0 23 26
word 0 23 26
and 0 23 26
implication, 0 23 26
that 0 23 26
everything 0 23 26
the 0 23 26
Catholic 0 23 26
Church 0 23 26
had 0 23 26
taught 0 23 26
before 0 23 26
Vatican 0 23 26
II 0 23 26
was 0 23 26
pernicious 1 23 26
nonsense. 1 23 26

Where 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
simply 0 23 27
wrong 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
ridiculous 0 23 27
and 0 23 27
where 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
wrong 0 23 27
and 0 23 27
political 0 23 27
it 1 23 27
was 1 23 27
outright 1 23 27
wicked. 1 23 27

What 0 23 28
led 0 23 28
me 0 23 28
to 0 23 28
read 0 23 28
that 0 23 28
particular 0 23 28
encyclical 0 23 28
is 0 23 28
the 0 23 28
most 0 23 28
clearly 0 23 28
identifiable 0 23 28
moment 0 23 28
of 0 23 28
actual 0 23 28
grace 0 23 28
in 0 23 28
my 0 23 28
young 0 23 28
life 0 23 28
to 0 23 28
that 0 23 28

point. 0 23 29
It 0 23 29
was 0 23 29
the 0 23 29
first 0 23 29
time 0 23 29
it 0 23 29
occurred 0 23 29
to 0 23 29
me 0 23 29
to 0 23 29
investigate, 0 23 29
like 0 23 29
an 0 23 29
anthropologist, 0 23 29
what 0 23 29
the 0 23 29
Church 0 23 29
herself 0 23 29
said 0 23 29
about 0 23 29
her 0 23 29
teachings. 0 23 29

While 0 23 30
mulling 0 23 30
grimly 0 23 30
one 0 23 30
day 0 23 30
over 0 23 30
all 0 23 30
the 0 23 30
wickedness 0 23 30
of 0 23 30
the 0 23 30
Catholic 0 23 30
Church, 0 23 30
I 0 23 30
was 0 23 30
pulled 0 23 30
up 0 23 30
short 0 23 30
by 0 23 30
a 0 23 30
single 0 23 30
thought: 0 23 30
“I 0 23 30
could 0 23 30
be 0 23 30
wrong.” 0 23 30
At 0 23 30
17 0 23 30
it 0 23 30
seemed 0 23 30
such 0 23 30
an 0 23 30
unlikely 0 23 30
thing 0 23 30
to 0 23 30
think 0 23 30
I 0 23 30
was 0 23 30
rather 0 23 30
shocked. 0 23 30

But 0 23 31
stopping 0 23 31
a 0 23 31
moment 0 23 31
to 0 23 31
consider, 0 23 31
I 0 23 31
realised 0 23 31
that 0 23 31
I 0 23 31
had 0 23 31
only 0 23 31
ever 0 23 31
heard 0 23 31
about 0 23 31
Catholic 0 23 31
things 0 23 31
from 0 23 31
people 0 23 31
who 0 23 31
clearly 0 23 31
hated 0 23 31
the 0 23 31
Church; 0 23 31
her 0 23 31
enemies, 0 23 31
in 0 23 31

short. 0 23 32
It 0 23 32
hardly 0 23 32
seemed 0 23 32
just 0 23 32
to 0 23 32
convict 0 23 32
on 0 23 32
the 0 23 32
testimony 0 23 32
of 0 23 32
these 0 23 32
obviously 0 23 32
biased 0 23 32
witnesses. 0 23 32

In 0 23 33
order 0 23 33
to 0 23 33
properly 0 23 33
and 0 23 33
thoroughly 0 23 33
condemn 0 23 33
the 0 23 33
Church, 0 23 33
with 0 23 33
convincing 0 23 33
due 0 23 33
diligence, 0 23 33
I 0 23 33
had 0 23 33
to 0 23 33
read 0 23 33
something 0 23 33
about 0 23 33
it 0 23 33
that 0 23 33
didn’t 0 23 33
come 0 23 33
from 0 23 33
her 0 23 33
enemies. 0 23 33

The 0 23 34
same 0 23 34
day, 0 23 34
I 0 23 34
presented 0 23 34
myself 0 23 34
at 0 23 34
the 0 23 34
reference 0 23 34
desk 0 23 34
of 0 23 34
the 0 23 34
public 0 23 34
library 0 23 34
and 0 23 34
asked, 0 23 34
“Do 0 23 34
you 0 23 34
have 0 23 34
any 0 23 34
books 0 23 34
about 0 23 34
Catholicism? 0 23 34

Something 0 23 35
official?” 0 23 35
The 0 23 35
librarian 0 23 35
took 0 23 35
me 0 23 35
to 0 23 35
the 0 23 35
reference 0 23 35
section 0 23 35
and 0 23 35
showed 0 23 35
me 0 23 35
the 0 23 35
shelves 0 23 35
of 0 23 35
encyclicals, 0 23 35
documents 0 23 35
and 0 23 35
histories. 0 23 35

Saints 0 23 36
and 0 23 36
popes 0 23 36
from 0 23 36
one 0 23 36
end 0 23 36
of 0 23 36
the 0 23 36
stacks 0 23 36
to 0 23 36
the 0 23 36

other. 0 23 37
Having 0 23 37
no 0 23 37
clear 0 23 37
idea 0 23 37
what 0 23 37
my 0 23 37
own 0 23 37
question 0 23 37
meant, 0 23 37
I 0 23 37
just 0 23 37
picked 0 23 37
one 0 23 37
at 0 23 37

random. 0 23 38
The 0 23 38
description 0 23 38
of 0 23 38
the 0 23 38
Holy 0 23 38
Eucharist 0 23 38
as 0 23 38
the 0 23 38
supreme 0 23 38
Centre 0 23 38
from 0 23 38
which 0 23 38
all 0 23 38
our 0 23 38
life 0 23 38
as 0 23 38
Catholics 0 23 38
flow, 0 23 38
and 0 23 38
from 0 23 38
which 0 23 38
all 0 23 38
other 0 23 38
doctrines 0 23 38
radiated, 0 23 38
was 0 23 38
something 0 23 38
that 0 23 38
was 0 23 38
not 0 23 38
going 0 23 38
to 0 23 38
come 0 23 38
into 0 23 38
my 0 23 38
head 0 23 38
for 0 23 38
another 0 23 38
eight 0 23 38
years 0 23 38
of 0 23 38

reading. 0 23 39
But 0 23 39
even 0 23 39
so, 0 23 39
Mysterium 0 23 39
Fidei 0 23 39
forced 0 23 39
me 0 23 39
to 0 23 39
face 0 23 39
up 0 23 39
to 0 23 39
a 0 23 39
reality 0 23 39
I’d 0 23 39
never 0 23 39
dreamed 0 23 39
of 0 23 39
before; 0 23 39
that 0 23 39
this, 0 23 39
the 0 23 39
little 0 23 39
unassuming 0 23 39
wafer, 0 23 39
was 0 23 39
the 0 23 39
most 0 23 39
important 0 23 39
thing 0 23 39
in 0 23 39
the 0 23 39

world. 0 23 40
Reading 0 23 40
through 0 23 40
the 0 23 40
encyclical 0 23 40
again, 0 23 40
holding 0 23 40
it 0 23 40
up 0 23 40
next 0 23 40
to 0 23 40
the 0 23 40
current 0 23 40
situation 0 23 40
in 0 23 40
Rome, 0 23 40
makes 0 23 40
it 0 23 40
easier 0 23 40
to 0 23 40
clarify 0 23 40
certain 0 23 40
critical 0 23 40

issues. 0 23 41
Given 0 23 41
what 0 23 41
we 0 23 41
are 0 23 41
now 0 23 41
seeing, 0 23 41
consider 0 23 41
the 0 23 41
poignancy 0 23 41
of 0 23 41
the 0 23 41
following 0 23 41

passages: 0 23 42
When 0 23 42
dealing 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
restoration 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
sacred 0 23 42
liturgy, 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
Fathers 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
council, 0 23 42
by 0 23 42
reason 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
their 0 23 42
pastoral 0 23 42
concern 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
whole 0 23 42
Church, 0 23 42
considered 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
highest 0 23 42
importance 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
exhort 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
faithful 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
participate 0 23 42
actively 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
sound 0 23 42
faith 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
utmost 0 23 42
devotion 0 23 42
in 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
celebration 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
this 0 23 42
Most 0 23 42
Holy 0 23 42
Mystery, 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
offer 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
priest 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
God 0 23 42
as 0 23 42
a 0 23 42
sacrifice 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
their 0 23 42
own 0 23 42
salvation 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
that 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
whole 0 23 42
world, 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
find 0 23 42
in 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
spiritual 0 23 42
nourishment. 0 23 42

This 0 23 43
was, 0 23 43
remember, 0 23 43
1965, 0 23 43
four 0 23 43
years 0 23 43
before 0 23 43
the 0 23 43
New 0 23 43
Mass 0 23 43
was 0 23 43
issued 0 23 43
and 0 23 43
before 0 23 43
Cardinal 0 23 43
Ottaviani 0 23 43
warned 0 23 43
the 0 23 43
pope 0 23 43
that 0 23 43
it 0 23 43
was 0 23 43
precisely 0 23 43
this 1 23 43
sacramental 1 23 43
reality 1 23 43
that 1 23 43
was 1 23 43
about 1 23 43
to 1 23 43
be 1 23 43
catastrophically 1 23 43

obscured. 1 23 44
Who, 0 23 44
reading 0 23 44
this 0 23 44
passage, 0 23 44
does 0 23 44
not 0 23 44
feel 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
urge 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
shout 0 23 44
down 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
years, 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
do 0 23 44
something 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
stave 0 23 44
off 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
disaster 0 23 44
that 0 23 44

was 0 23 45
coming: 0 23 45
[W]e 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
aware 0 23 45
of 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
fact 0 23 45
that, 0 23 45
among 0 23 45
those 0 23 45
who 0 23 45
deal 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
this 0 23 45
Most 0 23 45
Holy 0 23 45
Mystery 0 23 45
in 0 23 45
written 0 23 45
or 0 23 45
spoken 0 23 45
word, 0 23 45
there 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
some 0 23 45
who 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
reference 0 23 45
either 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
Masses 0 23 45
which 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
celebrated 0 23 45
in 0 23 45
private, 0 23 45
or 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
dogma 0 23 45
of 0 23 45
transubstantiation, 0 23 45
or 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
devotion 0 23 45
to 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
Eucharist, 0 23 45
spread 0 23 45
abroad 0 23 45
opinions 0 23 45
which 0 23 45
disturb 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
faithful 0 23 45
and 0 23 45
fill 0 23 45
their 0 23 45
minds 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
no 0 23 45
little 0 23 45
confusion 0 23 45
about 0 23 45
matters 0 23 45

of 0 23 46
faith. 0 23 46
It 0 23 46
is 0 23 46
as 0 23 46
if 0 23 46
everyone 0 23 46
were 0 23 46
permitted 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
consign 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
oblivion 0 23 46
doctrine 0 23 46
already 0 23 46
defined 0 23 46
by 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
Church, 0 23 46
or 0 23 46
else 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
interpret 0 23 46
it 0 23 46
in 0 23 46
such 0 23 46
a 0 23 46
way 0 23 46
as 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
weaken 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
genuine 0 23 46
meaning 0 23 46
of 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
words 0 23 46
or 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
recognized 0 23 46
force 0 23 46
of 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
concepts 0 23 46

involved. 0 23 47
Keeping 0 23 47
Cardinal 0 23 47
Ottaviani’s 0 23 47
Intervention 0 23 47
directly 0 23 47
before 0 23 47
our 0 23 47
thoughts, 0 23 47
we 0 23 47
read 0 23 47
with 0 23 47
a 0 23 47
strange 0 23 47
kind 0 23 47
of 0 23 47
helpless 0 23 47

dread… 0 23 48
…it 1 23 48
is 1 23 48
not 1 23 48
allowable 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
emphasize 1 23 48
what 1 23 48
is 1 23 48
called 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
“communal” 1 23 48
Mass 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
disparagement 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
Masses 1 23 48
celebrated 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
private, 1 23 48
or 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
exaggerate 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
element 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
sacramental 1 23 48
sign 1 23 48
as 1 23 48
if 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
symbolism, 1 23 48
which 1 23 48
all 1 23 48
certainly 1 23 48
admit 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
Eucharist, 1 23 48
expresses 1 23 48
fully 1 23 48
and 1 23 48
exhausts 1 23 48
completely 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
mode 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
Christ’s 1 23 48
presence 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
this 1 23 48

sacrament. 1 23 49
Nor 1 23 49
is 1 23 49
it 1 23 49
allowable 1 23 49
to 1 23 49
discuss 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
mystery 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
transubstantiation 1 23 49
without 1 23 49
mentioning 1 23 49
what 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Council 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
Trent 1 23 49
stated 1 23 49
about 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
marvelous 1 23 49
conversion 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
whole 1 23 49
substance 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
bread 1 23 49
into 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Body 1 23 49
and 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
whole 1 23 49
substance 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
wine 1 23 49
into 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Blood 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
Christ, 1 23 49
speaking 1 23 49
rather 1 23 49
only 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
what 1 23 49
is 1 23 49
called 1 23 49
“transignification” 1 23 49
and 1 23 49
“transfiguration,” 1 23 49
or 0 23 49
finally 0 23 49
to 0 23 49
propose 0 23 49

been 0 23 53
working 0 23 53
to 0 23 53
clarify 0 23 53
that 0 23 53
the 0 23 53
attack 0 23 53
from 0 23 53
Rome 0 23 53
on 0 23 53
the 0 23 53
moral 0 23 53
doctrine 0 23 53
of 0 23 53
the 0 23 53
Church 0 23 53
isn’t 0 23 53
about 0 23 53

marriage. 0 23 54
It’s 0 23 54
about 0 23 54
the 0 23 54
Eucharist 0 23 54
and 0 23 54
to 0 23 54
a 0 23 54
lesser 0 23 54
extent 0 23 54
the 0 23 54

The 1 23 55
demonic 1 23 55
forces 1 23 55
we 1 23 55
know 1 23 55
are 1 23 55
the 1 23 55
driving 1 23 55
force 1 23 55
behind 1 23 55
this 1 23 55
supreme 1 23 55
moment 1 23 55
of 1 23 55
heresy 1 23 55
and 1 23 55
destruction 1 23 55
aren’t 1 23 55
really 1 23 55
looking 1 23 55
at 1 23 55
the 1 23 55
undermining 1 23 55
of 1 23 55
marriage 1 23 55
as 1 23 55
their 1 23 55
primary 1 23 55
goal; 1 23 55
they 1 23 55
want 1 23 55
to 1 23 55
get 1 23 55
at 1 23 55
the 1 23 55

Eucharist. 1 23 56
We 1 23 56
know 1 23 56
it 1 23 56
is 1 23 56
demonically 1 23 56
inspired 1 23 56
because 1 23 56
their 1 23 56
hatred 1 23 56
is 1 23 56
for 1 23 56
Christ 1 23 56
Himself 1 23 56
in 1 23 56
the 1 23 56
first 1 23 56
place 1 23 56
and 1 23 56
for 1 23 56
anyone 1 23 56
who 1 23 56
loves 1 23 56
and 1 23 56
wants 1 23 56
to 1 23 56
serve 1 23 56

Him 1 23 57
second. 1 23 57
They 1 23 57
are 1 23 57
men 1 23 57
who 1 23 57
refuse 1 23 57
to 1 23 57
bend 1 23 57
the 1 23 57
knee 1 23 57
before 1 23 57
the 1 23 57
God 1 23 57
whom 1 23 57
they 1 23 57
will 1 23 57

not 1 23 58
serve. 1 23 58
This 0 23 58
knowledge 0 23 58
– 0 23 58
that 0 23 58
the 0 23 58
attack 0 23 58
is 0 23 58
on 0 23 58
the 0 23 58
Body 0 23 58
and 0 23 58
Blood 0 23 58
of 0 23 58

in 0 23 59
the 0 23 59

The 0 23 59
places 0 23 59
where 0 23 59
Eucharistic 0 23 59
adoration 0 23 59
is 0 23 59
still 0 23 59
offered 0 23 59
are 0 23 59
places 0 23 59
where 0 23 59
at 0 23 59

some 0 23 59
flicker 0 23 59
of 0 23 59
the 0 23 59
true 0 23 59
Faith 0 23 59

survives. 0 23 60
The 0 23 60
bishops 0 23 60

priests 0 23 60
now 0 23 60
talking 0 23 60

glory 0 23 60
of 0 23 60

need 0 23 60
to 0 23 60
defend 0 23 60
it 0 23 60
from 0 23 60

A 0 23 61

in 0 23 62
England. 0 23 62
In 0 23 62
March, 0 23 62
2016, 0 23 62
in 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
midst 0 23 62
of 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
shouting 0 23 62
from 0 23 62
Rome, 0 23 62
Bishop 0 23 62
Davies 0 23 62
spoke 0 23 62
at 0 23 62
his 0 23 62
Chrism 0 23 62
Mass 0 23 62
said 0 23 62
that 0 23 62
only 0 23 62
through 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
“reality 0 23 62
of 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
Eucharist” 0 23 62
could 0 23 62
new 0 23 62
vocations 0 23 62
to 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
priesthood 0 23 62

be 0 23 63
found. 0 23 63
“In 0 23 63
treasuring 0 23 63
this 0 23 63
gift 0 23 63
of 0 23 63
priestly 0 23 63
celibacy 0 23 63
we 0 23 63
need 0 23 63
to 0 23 63
recognize 0 23 63
more 0 23 63
clearly 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
intimate 0 23 63
link 0 23 63
between 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
Ministerial 0 23 63
Priesthood 0 23 63
and 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
reality 0 23 63
of 0 23 63

the 0 23 64
Eucharist. 0 23 64
If 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
Mass 1 23 64
were 1 23 64
ever 1 23 64
reduced 1 23 64
in 1 23 64
our 1 23 64
minds 1 23 64
to 1 23 64
being 1 23 64
merely 1 23 64
a 1 23 64
commemorative 1 23 64
meal 1 23 64
and 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
priest 1 23 64
as 1 23 64
only 1 23 64
a 1 23 64
community 1 23 64
leader 1 23 64
or 1 23 64
functionary, 1 23 64
then 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
celibacy 1 23 64
of 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
Catholic 1 23 64
Priesthood 1 23 64
might 1 23 64
seem 1 23 64

extravagant.” 1 23 65
It’s 0 23 65
almost 0 23 65
as 0 23 65
if 0 23 65
someone 0 23 65
had 0 23 65

through 0 23 66
the 0 23 66

theologically 0 23 66
tunnel-visioned 0 23 66
Cardinal 0 23 66
Kasper, 0 23 66
is 1 23 66
demonically 1 23 66

brilliant. 1 23 67
It’s 0 23 67
a 0 23 67
“stitch-up” 0 23 67
as 0 23 67
the 0 23 67
English 0 23 67

call 0 23 68
it; 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
fix. 0 23 68
You 0 23 68
make 0 23 68
it 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
matter 0 23 68
of 0 23 68
“mercy” 0 23 68
(backed 0 23 68
up 0 23 68
by 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
iron 0 23 68
fist) 0 23 68
that 0 23 68
no 0 23 68
one 0 23 68

a 0 23 68
state 0 23 68
of 0 23 68
objective 0 23 68
mortal 0 23 68
sin 0 23 68
can 0 23 68
be 0 23 68
refused 0 23 68
Holy 0 23 68
Communion; 0 23 68
you 0 23 68
give 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
national 0 23 68
bishops 0 23 68
conferences 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
power 0 23 68
to 0 23 68
start 0 23 68
enforcing 0 23 68
this, 0 23 68
and 0 23 68
you 0 23 68
have 0 23 68
created 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
previously 0 23 68
unimaginable 0 23 68
situation 0 23 68

in 0 23 69
the 0 23 69
Church. 0 23 69
You 0 23 69
have 0 23 69
created 0 23 69
a 0 23 69
regime 0 23 69
in 0 23 69
which 0 23 69
a 0 23 69
refusal 0 23 69
to 0 23 69
desecrate 0 23 69
the 0 23 69
sacred 0 23 69

will 0 23 69
be 0 23 69
grounds 0 23 69
for 0 23 69
persecution 0 23 69
of 0 23 69
faithful 0 23 69
priests, 0 23 69
seminarians 0 23 69

and 0 23 70
laity. 0 23 70
And 0 23 70
of 0 23 70
course, 0 23 70
we 0 23 70
are 0 23 70
seeing 0 23 70
it 0 23 70
starting 0 23 70

already. 0 23 71
It’s 0 23 71
a 0 23 71
brilliant 0 23 71
strategy, 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
magic 0 23 71
bullet 0 23 71
that 0 23 71
will 0 23 71
revert 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
Church 0 23 71
to 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
1976 0 23 71
model 0 23 71
on 0 23 71
every 0 23 71
front, 0 23 71
and 0 23 71
very 0 23 71
likely 0 23 71
keep 0 23 71
it 0 23 71

there 0 23 72
forever. 0 23 72
As 0 23 72
if 0 23 72
the 0 23 72
goal 0 23 72
was 0 23 72
to 0 23 72
go 0 23 72
back 0 23 72
in 0 23 72
time 0 23 72

erase 0 23 72
the 0 23 72
entire 0 23 72
John 0 23 72

II/Benedict 0 23 72
XVI 0 23 72
period 0 23 72

out 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
history. 0 23 73
It 0 23 73
will 0 23 73
halt 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
revival 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
eucharistic 0 23 73
piety 0 23 73
among 0 23 73
seminarians; 0 23 73
in 0 23 73
fact, 0 23 73
it 0 23 73
will 0 23 73
reverse 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
general 0 23 73
reforming 0 23 73
trend 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
“conservative” 0 23 73
seminaries 0 23 73
that 0 23 73
was 0 23 73
such 0 23 73
a 0 23 73
feature 0 23 73
under 0 23 73
John 0 23 73
Paul 0 23 73
II 0 23 73
and 0 23 73
has 0 23 73
for 0 23 73
30 0 23 73
years 0 23 73
been 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
hook 0 23 73
upon 0 23 73
which 0 23 73
all 0 23 73
hopes 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
restoration 0 23 73

have 0 23 74
hung. 0 23 74
It 0 23 74
is 0 23 74
easy 0 23 74
to 0 23 74
see 0 23 74
what 0 23 74

is 0 23 75
coming 0 23 75
next. 0 23 75
Once 0 23 75
certain 0 23 75
announcements 0 23 75
are 0 23 75
published 0 23 75
in 0 23 75
parish 0 23 75
bulletins, 0 23 75
laity 0 23 75
will 0 23 75
have 0 23 75
to 0 23 75
consider 0 23 75
whether 0 23 75
they 0 23 75
can, 0 23 75
in 0 23 75
conscience, 0 23 75
continue 0 23 75
to 0 23 75
assist 0 23 75
at 0 23 75
Masses 0 23 75
where 0 23 75
systematic 0 23 75
sacrilege 0 23 75
has 0 23 75
been 0 23 75
formally 0 23 75
adopted 0 23 75

as 0 23 76
the 0 23 76
rule. 0 23 76
The 0 23 76
few 0 23 76
bishops 0 23 76
with 0 23 76
sufficient 0 23 76
spine 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
stand 0 23 76
up 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
the 0 23 76
pressure 0 23 76
of 0 23 76
both 0 23 76
Rome 0 23 76
and 0 23 76
their 0 23 76

with 0 23 76
directives 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
make 0 23 76
doctrinal 0 23 76
declarations 0 23 76
– 0 23 76
will 1 23 76
be 1 23 76
ruling 1 23 76
embattled 1 23 76
islands 1 23 76
of 1 23 76
Catholicism 1 23 76
in 1 23 76
a 1 23 76
poisoned 1 23 76
sea 1 23 76
of 1 23 76
systematic 1 23 76
heresy 1 23 76

and 1 23 77
desecration. 1 23 77
A 1 23 77
dark, 1 23 77
impenetrable 1 23 77
and 1 23 77
“irreversible” 1 23 77
winter 1 23 77
of 1 23 77
persecution 1 23 77
of 1 23 77
the 1 23 77
faithful 1 23 77
by 1 23 77
their 1 23 77
own 1 23 77

fall. 1 23 78
Not 0 23 78
being 0 23 78
a 0 23 78
theologian 0 23 78
I 0 23 78
have 0 23 78
no 0 23 78
idea 0 23 78
if 0 23 78
this 0 23 78
encyclical 0 23 78
is, 0 23 78
as 0 23 78
so 0 23 78

a 0 23 85

For 0 23 86
me 0 23 86
at 0 23 86

it 0 23 86
was 0 23 86
the 0 23 86

not 0 58 15
to 0 58 15

[Y]ou 0 58 16
seem 0 58 16

even 0 58 16
mock 0 58 16

stone-throwers 1 58 16
who 1 58 16
embody 1 58 16

merciless 1 58 16
rigorism. 1 58 16

is 0 58 17
alien 0 58 17

Petrine 0 58 17

cannotsurvive 0 58 18

and 0 58 18
so 0 58 18
must 0 58 18
be 0 58 18
sustained 0 58 18
by 0 58 18
“ad 0 58 18
hominem” 0 58 18
arguments. 0 58 18

[T]oo 0 58 19
often 0 58 19

dead 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
bookish, 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
far 0 58 20
from 0 58 20
the 0 58 20
pastoral 0 58 20
concerns 0 58 20
of 0 58 20
everyday 0 58 20
life. 0 58 20

Your 0 58 21
critics 0 58 21
have 0 58 21
been 0 58 21
accused, 0 58 21
in 0 58 21
your 0 58 21
own 0 58 21
words, 0 58 21
of 0 58 21
making 0 58 21
doctrine 0 58 21
an 0 58 21
ideology. 0 58 21

But 0 58 22
it 0 58 22
is 0 58 22
precisely 0 58 22
Christian 0 58 22
doctrine… 0 58 22
that 0 58 22
frees 0 58 22
people 0 58 22
from 0 58 22
worldly 0 58 22
ideologies 0 58 22
and 0 58 22
assures 0 58 22
that 0 58 22
they 0 58 22
are 0 58 22
actually 0 58 22

and 0 58 22

the 0 58 23
doctrines 0 58 23
of 0 58 23
the 0 58 23
Church 0 58 23
[i.e., 0 58 23

separate 0 58 24
themselves 0 58 24
from 0 58 24
Jesus, 0 58 24
the 0 58 24
author 0 58 24
of 0 58 24
truth… 0 58 24
What 0 58 24
they 0 58 24
[i.e., 0 58 24
Francis] 0 58 24
then 0 58 24
possess, 0 58 24
and 0 58 24
can 0 58 24
only 0 58 24
possess, 0 58 24
is 0 58 24
an 0 58 24
ideology 0 58 24
– 0 58 24
one 0 58 24
that 0 58 24
conforms 0 58 24
to 0 58 24
the 0 58 24
world 0 58 24
of 0 58 24

even 0 58 25
defend 0 58 25
them. 0 58 25

What 0 58 26
scandalizes 0 58 26
believers, 0 58 26
and 0 58 26
even 0 58 26
some 0 58 26
fellow 0 58 26
bishops, 0 58 26
is 0 58 26
not 0 58 26
only 0 58 26
your 0 58 26
having 0 58 26
appointed 0 58 26
such 0 58 26
men 0 58 26
to 0 58 26
be 0 58 26
shepherds 0 58 26
of 0 58 26
the 0 58 26
Church, 0 58 26
but 0 58 26
that 0 58 26
you 0 58 26
also 0 58 26
seem 0 58 26
silent 0 58 26
in 0 58 26
the 0 58 26
face 0 58 26
of 0 58 26
their 0 58 26
teaching 0 58 26
and 0 58 26
pastoral 0 58 26
practice…. 0 58 26

As 0 58 27
a 0 58 27
result, 0 58 27
many 0 58 27
of 0 58 27
the 0 58 27
faithful, 0 58 27
who 0 58 27
embody 0 58 27
the 0 58 27
"sensus 0 58 27
fidelium," 0 58 27
are 0 58 27
losing 0 58 27
confidence 0 58 27
in 0 58 27
their 0 58 27
supreme 0 58 27
shepherd. 0 58 27

[T]he 0 58 28
Church 0 58 28
is 0 58 28
one 0 58 28
body, 0 58 28
the 0 58 28
Mystical 0 58 28
Body 0 58 28
of 0 58 28
Christ, 0 58 28
and 0 58 28
you 0 58 28
are 0 58 28
commissioned 0 58 28
by 0 58 28
the 0 58 28
Lord 0 58 28
himself 0 58 28
to 0 58 28
promote 0 58 28
and 0 58 28
strengthen 0 58 28
her 0 58 28
unity. 0 58 28

But 0 58 29
your 0 58 29
actions 0 58 29
and 0 58 29
words 0 58 29
too 0 58 29
often 0 58 29
seem 0 58 29
intent 0 58 29
on 0 58 29
doing 0 58 29
the 0 58 29
opposite…. 0 58 29

You 0 58 30
have 0 58 30
often 0 58 30
spoken 0 58 30
about 0 58 30
the 0 58 30
need 0 58 30
for 0 58 30
transparency 0 58 30
within 0 58 30
the 0 58 30
Church. 0 58 30

You 0 58 31
have 0 58 31
frequently 0 58 31
encouraged… 0 58 31
all 0 58 31
persons, 0 58 31
especially 0 58 31
bishops, 0 58 31
to 0 58 31
speak 0 58 31
their 0 58 31
mind 0 58 31
and 0 58 31
not 0 58 31
be 0 58 31
fearful 0 58 31
of 0 58 31
what 0 58 31
the 0 58 31
pope 0 58 31
may 0 58 31
think. 0 58 31

But… 0 58 32
what 0 58 32
many 0 58 32
[bishops] 0 58 32
have 0 58 32
learned 0 58 32
from 0 58 32
your 0 58 32
pontificate 0 58 32
is 0 58 32
not 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
you 0 58 32
are 0 58 32
open 0 58 32
to 0 58 32
criticism, 0 58 32
but 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
you 0 58 32
resent 0 58 32
it… 0 58 32
Many 0 58 32
fear 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
if 0 58 32
they 0 58 32
speak 0 58 32
their 0 58 32
mind, 0 58 32
they 0 58 32
will 0 58 32
be 0 58 32
marginalized 0 58 32
or 0 58 32
worse. 0 58 32

I 0 58 33
have 0 58 33
often 0 58 33
asked 0 58 33
myself: 0 58 33
"Why 0 58 33
has 0 58 33
Jesus 0 58 33
let 0 58 33
all 0 58 33
of 0 58 33
this 0 58 33
happen?" 0 58 33

The 1 58 34
only 1 58 34
answer 1 58 34
that 1 58 34
comes 1 58 34
to 1 58 34
mind 1 58 34
is 1 58 34
that 1 58 34
Jesus 1 58 34
wants 1 58 34
to 1 58 34
manifest 1 58 34
just 1 58 34
how 1 58 34
weak 1 58 34
is 1 58 34
the 1 58 34
faith 1 58 34
of 1 58 34
many 1 58 34
within 1 58 34
the 1 58 34
Church, 1 58 34
even 1 58 34
among 1 58 34
too 1 58 34
many 1 58 34
of 1 58 34
her 1 58 34
bishops. 1 58 34

Ironically, 1 58 35
your 1 58 35
pontificate 1 58 35
has 1 58 35
given 1 58 35
those 1 58 35
who 1 58 35
hold 1 58 35
harmful 1 58 35
theological 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
pastoral 1 58 35
views 1 58 35
the 1 58 35
license 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
confidence 1 58 35
to 1 58 35
come 1 58 35
into 1 58 35
the 1 58 35
light 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
expose 1 58 35
their 1 58 35
previously 1 58 35
hidden 1 58 35
darkness…. 1 58 35

Father 0 58 36
Weinandy 0 58 36
reveals 0 58 36
that 0 58 36
he 0 58 36
decided 0 58 36
to 0 58 36
publicize 0 58 36
this 0 58 36
historic 0 58 36
missive 0 58 36
only 0 58 36
after 0 58 36
receiving 0 58 36
an 0 58 36
unmistakable 0 58 36
sign 0 58 36
from 0 58 36
heaven. 0 58 36

As 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
recounts 0 58 37
here, 0 58 37
after 0 58 37
repeatedly 0 58 37
“beseeching 0 58 37
Jesus 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
Mary, 0 58 37
St. 0 58 37
Peter 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
all 0 58 37
of 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
saintly 0 58 37
popes 0 58 37
who 0 58 37
are 0 58 37
buried 0 58 37
there 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
do 0 58 37
something 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
rectify 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
confusion 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
turmoil 0 58 37
within 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
Church 0 58 37
today, 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
chaos 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
an 0 58 37
uncertainty 0 58 37
that 0 58 37
I 0 58 37
felt 0 58 37
Pope 0 58 37
Francis 0 58 37
had 0 58 37
himself 0 58 37
caused,” 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
asked 0 58 37
for 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
minutely 0 58 37
specific 0 58 37
sign 0 58 37
from 0 58 37
heaven 0 58 37
on 0 58 37
whether 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
should 0 58 37
write 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
letter: 0 58 37
that 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
next 0 58 37
day 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
meet 0 58 37
someone 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
had 0 58 37
not 0 58 37
seen 0 58 37
in 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
very 0 58 37
long 0 58 37
time, 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
never 0 58 37
expect 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
see 0 58 37
in 0 58 37
Rome, 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
was 0 58 37
not 0 58 37
from 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
United 0 58 37
States, 0 58 37
Canada 0 58 37
or 0 58 37
Great 0 58 37
Britain, 0 58 37
which 0 58 37
person 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
utter 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
particular 0 58 37
phrase: 0 58 37
“Keep 0 58 37
up 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
good 0 58 37
writing.” 0 58 37

At 0 58 38
lunch 0 58 38
the 0 58 38
next 0 58 38
day, 0 58 38
the 0 58 38
sign 0 58 38
was 0 58 38
given. 0 58 38

An 0 58 39
old 0 58 39
friend 0 58 39
he 0 58 39
had 0 58 39
not 0 58 39
seen 0 58 39
in 0 58 39
more 0 58 39
than 0 58 39
twenty 0 58 39
years 0 58 39
and 0 58 39
would 0 58 39
never 0 58 39
have 0 58 39
expected 0 58 39
to 0 58 39
meet 0 58 39
in 0 58 39
Rome, 0 58 39
who 0 58 39
is 0 58 39
now 0 58 39
an 0 58 39
archbishop, 0 58 39
appeared 0 58 39
suddenly 0 58 39
from 0 58 39
between 0 58 39
two 0 58 39
parked 0 58 39
cars, 0 58 39
renewed 0 58 39
acquaintances 0 58 39
and, 0 58 39
referring 0 58 39
to 0 58 39
one 0 58 39
of 0 58 39
Father 0 58 39
Weinandy’s 0 58 39
books, 0 58 39
said: 0 58 39
“Keep 0 58 39
up 0 58 39
the 0 58 39
good 0 58 39
writing.” 0 58 39

Writes 0 58 40

Fr. 0 58 41
Weinandy: 0 58 41
“I 0 58 41
could 0 58 41
hardly 0 58 41
believe 0 58 41
that 0 58 41
this 0 58 41
just 0 58 41
happened 0 58 41
in 0 58 41
a 0 58 41
matter 0 58 41
of 0 58 41
a 0 58 41
few 0 58 41
minutes. 0 58 41

But 0 58 42
there 0 58 42
was 0 58 42
no 0 58 42
longer 0 58 42
any 0 58 42
doubt 0 58 42
in 0 58 42
my 0 58 42
mind 0 58 42
that 0 58 42
Jesus 0 58 42
wanted 0 58 42
me 0 58 42
to 0 58 42
write 0 58 42
something. 0 58 42

I 0 58 43
also 0 58 43
think 0 58 43
it 0 58 43
significant 0 58 43
that 0 58 43
it 0 58 43
was 0 58 43
an 0 58 43
Archbishop 0 58 43
that 0 58 43
Jesus 0 58 43
used. 0 58 43

I 0 58 44
considered 0 58 44
it 0 58 44
an 0 58 44
apostolic 0 58 44
mandate.” 0 58 44

Can 0 58 45
we 0 58 45
doubt 0 58 45
that 0 58 45
it 0 58 45
was 0 58 45
indeed 0 58 45
an 0 58 45
apostolic 0 58 45
mandate? 0 58 45

Can 0 58 46
we 0 58 46
not 0 58 46
see 0 58 46
in 0 58 46

Fr. 0 58 47

to 0 58 57
the 0 58 57

a 0 114 12
simple 0 114 12
question: 0 114 12

did 0 114 12
they 0 114 12
literally 0 114 12
risk 0 114 12

“a 0 114 12

itself” 0 114 12
as 0 114 12
the 0 114 12
pope 0 114 12
“seems 0 114 12
to 0 114 12
teach”? 0 114 12

It’s 0 114 13
a 0 114 13
question 0 114 13
he 0 114 13
refuses 0 114 13
to 0 114 13
answer, 0 114 13
despite 0 114 13
endless 0 114 13
platitudes 0 114 13
of 0 114 13
how 0 114 13
important 0 114 13
it 0 114 13
is 0 114 13
to 0 114 13
be 0 114 13
close 0 114 13
to 0 114 13
the 0 114 13
marginalized 0 114 13
and 0 114 13
to 0 114 13

those 0 114 13
on 0 114 13
the 0 114 13

The 0 114 14
signers, 0 114 14
however, 0 114 14
are 0 114 14
not 0 114 14
dissuaded 0 114 14
in 0 114 14
their 0 114 14
pursuit 0 114 14
of 0 114 14
a 0 114 14
paternal 0 114 14
answer: 0 114 14

You 0 114 15
do 0 114 15
not 0 114 15
like 0 114 15
to 0 114 15
beat 0 114 15
around 0 114 15
the 0 114 15
bush, 0 114 15
and 0 114 15
neither 0 114 15
do 0 114 15
we, 0 114 15
so 0 114 15
allow 0 114 15
us 0 114 15
to 0 114 15
say 0 114 15
frankly 0 114 15
that 0 114 15
we 0 114 15
do 0 114 15
not 0 114 15
understand 0 114 15
your 0 114 15
teaching 0 114 15
about 0 114 15

as 0 114 15
we 0 114 15
read 0 114 15
in 0 114 15
paragraphs 0 114 15
252 0 114 15
and 0 114 15
253 0 114 15
of 0 114 15
Evangelii 0 114 15
Gaudium, 0 114 15
because 0 114 15
it 1 114 15
does 1 114 15
not 1 114 15
account 1 114 15
for 1 114 15
the 1 114 15
fact 1 114 15
that 1 114 15
Islam 1 114 15
came 1 114 15
AFTER 1 114 15
Christ, 1 114 15
and 1 114 15
so 1 114 15
is, 1 114 15
and 1 114 15
can 1 114 15
only 1 114 15
be, 1 114 15
an 1 114 15
Antichrist 1 114 15
(see 0 114 15
1 0 114 15
Jn 0 114 15
2.22), 0 114 15
and 0 114 15
one 0 114 15
of 0 114 15
the 0 114 15
most 0 114 15
dangerous 0 114 15
because 0 114 15
it 0 114 15
presents 0 114 15
itself 0 114 15
as 0 114 15
the 0 114 15
fulfillment 0 114 15
of 0 114 15
Revelation 0 114 15
(of 0 114 15
which 0 114 15

If 1 114 16
Islam 1 114 16
is 1 114 16
a 1 114 16
good 1 114 16
religion 1 114 16
in 1 114 16
itself, 1 114 16
as 1 114 16
you 1 114 16
seem 1 114 16
to 1 114 16
teach, 1 114 16
why 1 114 16
did 1 114 16
we 1 114 16
become 1 114 16
Catholic? 1 114 16

Do 0 114 17
not 0 114 17
your 0 114 17
words 0 114 17
question 0 114 17
the 0 114 17
soundness 0 114 17
of 0 114 17
the 0 114 17
choice 0 114 17

at 0 114 17
the 0 114 17
risk 0 114 17
of 0 114 17
our 0 114 17
lives? 0 114 17

death 0 114 18
for 0 114 18
apostates 0 114 18
(Quran 0 114 18

The 0 114 24
letter 0 114 24
makes 0 114 24
short 0 114 24
work 0 114 24
of 0 114 24

notion 0 114 24
that 0 114 24
Islam 0 114 24

can 0 114 24
ever 0 114 24

that 0 114 24

a 0 114 24
path 0 114 24
to 0 114 24

In 0 114 25
fact, 0 114 25
as 0 114 25
long 0 114 25
as 0 114 25

The 1 114 35

Farrakhan 1 142 10
had 1 142 10

Hitler 1 142 10
and 1 142 10
declared 1 142 10
that 1 142 10

Jews, 1 142 10
"can't 1 142 10
say 1 142 10
'Never 1 142 10

because 1 142 10

They 1 142 12
don't 1 142 12
like 1 142 12
Farrakhan, 1 142 12

they 1 142 12
call 1 142 12

Well, 1 142 13
that's 1 142 13

in 0 231 9
the 0 231 9

The 0 231 11
Daily 0 231 11
Mail 0 231 11
reported 0 231 11
that 0 231 11
one 0 231 11
diplomat 0 231 11
described 0 231 11
being 0 231 11
jolted 0 231 11
awake 0 231 11
in 0 231 11
a 0 231 11
Havana 0 231 11
hotel 0 231 11

by 0 231 11
a 0 231 11
grinding, 0 231 11
blaring 0 231 11
cacophony. 0 231 11

When 0 231 12
he 0 231 12
moved 0 231 12
a 0 231 12
few 0 231 12
feet 0 231 12
across 0 231 12
the 0 231 12
room, 0 231 12
the 0 231 12
noise 0 231 12
stopped. 0 231 12

When 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
got 0 231 13
back 0 231 13
into 0 231 13
bed, 0 231 13
the 0 231 13
agonizing 1 231 13
sound 0 231 13
hit 0 231 13
him 0 231 13
again; 0 231 13
as 0 231 13
if, 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
told 0 231 13
doctors, 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
had 0 231 13
walked 0 231 13
through 0 231 13
some 0 231 13
invisible 0 231 13
wall 0 231 13

straight 0 231 13

middle 0 231 13
of 0 231 13
his 0 231 13
room. 0 231 13

Whether 0 231 14
they 0 231 14
heard 0 231 14
anything 0 231 14
or 0 231 14
not, 0 231 14
the 0 231 14
consequences 0 231 14
have 0 231 14
been 0 231 14
unmistakable 0 231 14
— 0 231 14
symptoms 0 231 14
ranging 0 231 14
from 0 231 14
nosebleeds, 0 231 14
nausea, 0 231 14
dizziness 0 231 14
and 0 231 14
severe 0 231 14

an 0 253 45
April 0 253 45
2018 0 253 45
hearing 0 253 45
spurred 0 253 45
by 0 253 45
the 0 253 45
scandal 0 253 45
that 0 253 45
he 0 253 45
was 0 253 45
powerless 0 253 45

told 0 253 61
a 0 253 61

he 0 253 61
felt 0 253 61
“very 0 253 61

that 0 253 61

Prosecutors 0 253 64

the 0 253 64

that 0 253 64

That 0 274 2
said 0 274 2
it 0 274 2
all. 0 274 2

Just 0 274 3
out 0 274 3
of 0 274 3
hospital, 0 274 3
I 0 274 3
was 0 274 3
in 0 274 3
no 0 274 3
shape 0 274 3
to 0 274 3

its 0 274 3
very 0 274 3
witty 0 274 3

writers. 0 274 3

But 0 274 4
after 0 274 4
watching 0 274 4
a 0 274 4
week 0 274 4
of 0 274 4

totally 0 274 4

with 0 274 4
the 0 274 4

What 0 274 5
was 0 274 5
billed 0 274 5
as 0 274 5
a 0 274 5
second-coming 0 274 5
extravaganza 0 274 5
between 0 274 5
the 0 274 5
two 0 274 5
leaders 0 274 5
– 0 274 5
who 0 274 5
have 0 274 5
been 0 274 5
trading 0 274 5
insults 0 274 5
of 0 274 5
‘little 1 274 5
rocket 1 274 5
man’ 1 274 5
and 0 274 5
‘dotard’ 1 274 5
(someone 0 274 5
who 0 274 5
is 0 274 5
senile) 0 274 5
turned 0 274 5
out 0 274 5
to 0 274 5
be 0 274 5
a 0 274 5
very 1 274 5
expensive 1 274 5
photo 0 274 5
op 0 274 5
for 0 274 5
both 0 274 5
publicity 0 274 5
seekers 0 274 5
that 0 274 5
made 0 274 5
much 0 274 5
noise 0 274 5
but 0 274 5
produced 0 274 5
very 0 274 5
little 0 274 5
– 0 274 5
at 0 274 5
least 0 274 5
so 0 274 5
far. 0 274 5

It 0 274 6
seemed 0 274 6
as 0 274 6
if 0 274 6
two 0 274 6
schoolyard 1 274 6
bullies 1 274 6
had 0 274 6
been 0 274 6
forced 0 274 6

the 0 274 6
principal 0 274 6
to 0 274 6
shake 0 274 6
hands. 0 274 6

Beyond 0 274 7
gestures, 0 274 7
North 0 274 7
Korea’s 0 274 7
leader 0 274 7
certainly 0 274 7
came 0 274 7
out 0 274 7
ahead. 0 274 7

Trump’s 0 274 9
objectives, 0 274 9
at 0 274 9
least 0 274 9
initially, 0 274 9
were 0 274 9
to 1 274 9
crush 1 274 9
North 0 274 9
Korea 0 274 9

the 0 274 9

Japan 0 274 9
and 0 274 9

Korea. 0 274 9

Trump 0 274 10
sought 0 274 10
to 0 274 10
set 0 274 10
up 0 274 10
Kim 0 274 10
as 0 274 10
a 0 274 10
bogeyman, 1 274 10
and 0 274 10
himself 0 274 10
as 0 274 10
America’s 1 274 10
savior. 1 274 10

Trump 0 274 11
knew 0 274 11
perfectly 1 274 11
well 1 274 11
that 0 274 11
he 0 274 11
could 0 274 11
not 0 274 11
destroy 0 274 11
all 0 274 11
of 0 274 11
North 0 274 11
Korea’s 0 274 11
deeply 0 274 11
buried 0 274 11
nuclear-armed 0 274 11
missiles, 0 274 11
and, 0 274 11
in 0 274 11
spite 0 274 11
of 0 274 11
his 0 274 11
huffing 0 274 11
and 0 274 11
puffing, 0 274 11
had 1 274 11
no 1 274 11
stomach 1 274 11
for 1 274 11
an 1 274 11
invasion 1 274 11
of 0 274 11
North 0 274 11
Korea 0 274 11
that 0 274 11
could 0 274 11
cost 0 274 11
the 0 274 11
US 0 274 11
an 0 274 11
estimated 0 274 11
250,000 0 274 11
casualties. 0 274 11

So 0 274 12
Trump’s 0 274 12
solution 0 274 12
was 0 274 12
more 0 274 12
show-biz. 1 274 12

A 0 274 13
much 1 274 13
ballyhooed 1 274 13
flight 0 274 13
to 0 274 13
Singapore, 0 274 13
backslapping 0 274 13
a 0 274 13
delighted 1 274 13
Kim, 0 274 13
and 0 274 13
a 0 274 13
love-fest 1 274 13
between 0 274 13
the 0 274 13
two 0 274 13
chunky 1 274 13
leaders 0 274 13
was 1 274 13
sold 1 274 13
to 1 274 13
Americans 0 274 13
as 0 274 13
the 0 274 13
dawn 0 274 13
of 0 274 13
peace. 0 274 13

America’s 0 274 14
media 0 274 14
was 0 274 14
quick 0 274 14
to 0 274 14
retail 0 274 14
the 0 274 14
story 0 274 14
and 0 274 14
burnish 1 274 14
Trump’s 0 274 14
credentials 0 274 14
among 0 274 14
the 0 274 14
seriously 0 274 14
credulous. 0 274 14

No 0 274 15
more 0 274 15
hiding 0 274 15
under 0 274 15
your 0 274 15
school 0 274 15
desks 0 274 15
or 0 274 15
in 0 274 15
dank 0 274 15
basements. 0 274 15

As 0 274 16
Trump 0 274 16
grandly 1 274 16
proclaimed, 0 274 16
Americans 1 274 16
no 1 274 16
longer 1 274 16
have 1 274 16
to 1 274 16
fear 1 274 16
North 1 274 16
Korea 1 274 16
and 0 274 16
can 1 274 16
sleep 1 274 16
peacefully 1 274 16
at 1 274 16
night! 1 274 16

Why? 1 274 17

Korea 0 274 18
still 0 274 18
has 0 274 18
all 0 274 18
of 0 274 18
its 0 274 18
medium 0 274 18
and 0 274 18
long-ranged 0 274 18
missiles 0 274 18
and 0 274 18
an 0 274 18
estimated 0 274 18
40 0 274 18
or 0 274 18
more 0 274 18
nuclear 0 274 18
warheads. 0 274 18

The 0 274 19
North 0 274 19
is 0 274 19
developing 0 274 19
submarines 0 274 19
that 0 274 19
can 0 274 19
launch 0 274 19
nuclear-armed 0 274 19
missiles 0 274 19
from 0 274 19
underwater 0 274 19
off 0 274 19
America’s 0 274 19
coasts. 0 274 19

For 0 274 20
Kim, 0 274 20
these 0 274 20
weapons 0 274 20
are 0 274 20
purely 0 274 20
defensive, 0 274 20
designed 0 274 20
to 0 274 20
prevent 0 274 20
a 0 274 20
US 0 274 20
attack 0 274 20
on 0 274 20
his 0 274 20
nation. 0 274 20

But 0 274 21
he 0 274 21
is 0 274 21
now 0 274 21
a 0 274 21
full-fledged 0 274 21
member 0 274 21
of 0 274 21
the 0 274 21
nuclear 0 274 21
club. 0 274 21

Equally 0 274 22
important, 0 274 22
North 0 274 22
Korea 0 274 22
still 0 274 22
has 0 274 22
an 0 274 22
estimated 0 274 22
14,000 0 274 22
170mm 0 274 22
guns 0 274 22
and 0 274 22
hundreds 0 274 22
of 0 274 22
300mm 0 274 22
long-ranged 0 274 22
rocket 0 274 22
launchers 0 274 22
emplaced 0 274 22
in 0 274 22
caves 0 274 22
just 0 274 22
north 0 274 22
of 0 274 22
the 0 274 22
Demilitarized 0 274 22
Zone 0 274 22
between 0 274 22
the 0 274 22
two 0 274 22
Koreas. 0 274 22

They 0 274 23
threaten 0 274 23
almost 0 274 23
all 0 274 23
of 0 274 23
South 0 274 23
Korea’s 0 274 23
capital 0 274 23
Seoul 0 274 23
north 0 274 23
of 0 274 23
the 0 274 23
Han 0 274 23
River 0 274 23
and 0 274 23
some 0 274 23
US 0 274 23
military 0 274 23
bases 0 274 23
and 0 274 23
key 0 274 23
airfields, 0 274 23
notably 0 274 23
Osan. 0 274 23

This 0 274 24
is 0 274 24

There 0 274 28
is 0 274 28
no 0 274 28

of 0 274 28
this 0 274 28

in 0 274 28

But 0 274 29
it 0 274 29
was 0 274 29
agreed 0 274 29
to 0 274 29
temporarily 0 274 29

a 0 274 29
key 0 274 29
demand 0 274 29
by 0 274 29
Kim. 0 274 29

This 0 274 30
column 0 274 30
has 0 274 30
been 0 274 30
calling 0 274 30
for 0 274 30
their 0 274 30
end 0 274 30
for 0 274 30
a 0 274 30
decade. 0 274 30

North 0 274 31
Korea 0 274 31
will 0 274 31
seemingly 0 274 31
halt 0 274 31
its 0 274 31
missile 0 274 31
tests. 0 274 31

This 0 274 32
is 0 274 32
not 0 274 32
the 0 274 32
‘denuclearization’ 0 274 32
of 0 274 32
North 0 274 32
Korea 0 274 32
that 0 274 32
has 0 274 32
been 0 274 32
bandied 0 274 32
about. 0 274 32

There 0 274 33
may 0 274 33
be 0 274 33
a 0 274 33
few 0 274 33
gestures 0 274 33
of 0 274 33
disarmament 0 274 33
but 0 274 33
Kim 0 274 33
must 0 274 33
know 0 274 33
that 0 274 33
his 0 274 33
nukes 0 274 33
are 0 274 33
his 0 274 33
means 0 274 33
of 0 274 33
survival. 0 274 33

In 0 274 34
case 0 274 34
Kim 0 274 34
didn’t 0 274 34
remember 0 274 34
the 0 274 34
dire 0 274 34
fate 0 274 34
of 0 274 34

cheerfully 1 274 34
recalled 0 274 34

doom 1 274 34
of 0 274 34
Libya’s 0 274 34
murdered 0 274 34

The 0 274 35
Singapore 0 274 35
summit 0 274 35
was 0 274 35
also 0 274 35
a 0 274 35
huge 1 274 35

for 0 274 35

Japan 0 274 35

In 0 274 36
Asia, 0 274 36
preserving 0 274 36
‘face’ 0 274 36
is 0 274 36
essential. 0 274 36

Trump 0 274 37
completely 0 274 37
ignored 0 274 37
America’s 0 274 37
two 0 274 37
old 0 274 37
allies 0 274 37
after 0 274 37
his 0 274 37
meeting 0 274 37
with 0 274 37
Kim 0 274 37
– 0 274 37
who 0 274 37
routinely 0 274 37
blasts 0 274 37
Japan 0 274 37
and 0 274 37
South 0 274 37
Korea 0 274 37
as 0 274 37
‘America’s 1 274 37
stooges.’ 1 274 37
Instead, 0 274 37
Trump 0 274 37
sent 0 274 37
his 0 274 37
beginner 0 274 37
Secretary 0 274 37
of 0 274 37
State 0 274 37
Mike 0 274 37
Pompeo 0 274 37
to 0 274 37
explain 0 274 37
what 0 274 37
happened 0 274 37
in 0 274 37
Singapore, 0 274 37
inflicting 0 274 37
a 0 274 37
deep 0 274 37
loss 0 274 37
of 0 274 37
face 0 274 37
on 0 274 37
Tokyo 0 274 37
and 0 274 37
Seoul. 0 274 37

This 0 274 38
was 0 274 38
a 0 274 38
terrible 1 274 38
insult 1 274 38
and 0 274 38
could 0 274 38
spark 0 274 38
decisions 0 274 38
by 0 274 38
at 0 274 38
least 0 274 38
Japan 0 274 38
to 0 274 38
proceed 0 274 38
ahead 0 274 38
with 0 274 38
its 0 274 38
covert 0 274 38
nuclear 0 274 38
program. 0 274 38

Japan 0 274 39
can 0 274 39
deploy 0 274 39
nuclear 0 274 39
weapons 0 274 39
in 0 274 39
3-6 0 274 39
months; 0 274 39
South 0 274 39
Korea 0 274 39
is 0 274 39
not 0 274 39
far 0 274 39
behind. 0 274 39

The 0 274 40
United 0 274 40
States 0 274 40
and 0 274 40
North 0 274 40
Korea 0 274 40
are 0 274 40
now 0 274 40
on 0 274 40
a 0 274 40
more 0 274 40
civilized 0 274 40
level 0 274 40
of 0 274 40
behavior. 0 274 40

But 0 274 41
nothing 0 274 41
basic 0 274 41
has 0 274 41
been 0 274 41
resolved. 0 274 41

Maybe 0 274 42
Trump 0 274 42
has 0 274 42
some 0 274 42
more 0 274 42
concessions 0 274 42
up 0 274 42

ago 0 346 17
with 1 346 17
absolutely 1 346 17
no 1 346 17

The 0 346 18
CJC 0 346 18

a 0 346 18
human 0 346 18

The 0 346 19
question 0 346 19
remains: 0 346 19
why 1 346 19
would 1 346 19
Facebook 1 346 19

such 1 346 19

such 1 346 19
a 1 346 19
fascistic 1 346 19
manner 1 346 19
-- 1 346 19
and 1 346 19
never 1 346 19
explain 1 346 19
why? 1 346 19

In 0 346 20
April 0 346 20
earlier 0 346 20
this 0 346 20
year, 0 346 20
Jamie 0 346 20
was 0 346 20
suspended 0 346 20
from 0 346 20

him 0 346 20
on 0 346 20
the 0 346 20

Then, 0 346 21
in 0 346 21
May, 0 346 21
his 0 346 21
Twitter 0 346 21

was 0 346 21
temporarily 0 346 21
suspended 0 346 21

he 0 346 21
was 0 346 21
forced 0 346 21

directly 0 346 21
quoted 0 346 21
Islamic 0 346 21

texts. 0 346 21

His 0 346 22
account 0 346 22
was 0 346 22
suspended 0 346 22
for 0 346 22
violating 0 346 22
Twitter’s 0 346 22
rules 0 346 22
relating 0 346 22
to 0 346 22
“hateful 1 346 22
conduct.” 1 346 22
It 0 346 22
is 0 346 22
"hateful 1 346 22
conduct", 1 346 22
apparently, 0 346 22
to 0 346 22
reference 0 346 22
what 0 346 22
Islamic 0 346 22

say. 0 346 22

Indeed, 0 346 23
Frontpage's 0 346 23
editor 0 346 23
had 0 346 23
simply 0 346 23
referred 0 346 23

Bukhari’s 0 346 23

we 0 346 24

(To 0 346 36

off 0 406 17

also 0 406 18
pointed 0 406 18
out 0 406 18
that 0 406 18

"The 0 406 19
people 0 406 19

said 0 406 19
Trump. 0 406 19

“That 0 406 20

a 0 406 20

what 0 406 20

watched 0 406 20
up 0 406 20
there." 0 406 20

Additionally, 0 406 21
Trump 0 406 21
said 0 406 21
that 0 406 21
Donnelly 0 406 21
voted 0 406 21

While 0 406 22
some 0 406 22
don't 0 406 22
believe 0 406 22
that 0 406 22
Trump's 1 406 22
base 1 406 22
is 1 406 22
all 1 406 22
that 1 406 22
energized, 1 406 22
it 1 406 22
seems 1 406 22
pretty 1 406 22
energetic 1 406 22
to 1 406 22
me 1 406 22
and 0 406 22
attacks 0 406 22
on 0 406 22
conservatives 0 406 22
on 0 406 22

have 1 406 22
only 1 406 22
furthered 1 406 22
their 1 406 22
outrage 1 406 22
at 1 406 22
the 1 406 22
establishment, 1 406 22
both 0 406 22
Democrat 0 406 22
and 0 406 22
Republican. 0 406 22

We're 0 406 23
just 0 406 23
days 0 406 23
away 0 406 23
from 0 406 23
seeing 0 406 23
how 0 406 23
things 0 406 23
turn 0 406 23
out. 0 406 23

There's 0 406 24
a 0 406 24
part 0 406 24
of 0 406 24
me 0 406 24
that 0 406 24
thinks 0 406 24
this 0 406 24
may 0 406 24
actually 0 406 24
turn 0 406 24
out 0 406 24
to 0 406 24
be 0 406 24
one 0 406 24
of 0 406 24
the 0 406 24
biggest 0 406 24
turnouts 0 406 24
for 0 406 24
a 0 406 24
mid-term 0 406 24
election 0 406 24
that 0 406 24
we've 0 406 24
ever 0 406 24
seen, 0 406 24
but 0 406 24
that's 1 406 24
just 1 406 24
my 1 406 24
gut 1 406 24
feeling. 1 406 24

On 0 406 25
Tuesday, 0 406 25
we'll 0 406 25
know 0 406 25
for 0 406 25
sure. 0 406 25

I 0 406 26
don't 0 406 26
know 0 406 26
about 0 406 26
you, 0 406 26
but 0 406 26
I 0 406 26
didn't 0 406 26
actually 0 406 26
like 0 406 26
hearing 0 406 26
the 0 406 26
words 0 406 26
"Speaker 0 406 26

I 0 406 26

to 0 406 26

hear 0 406 26

already 0 379 18
submitted 0 379 18
statements 0 379 18
that 0 379 18
they 0 379 18
have 0 379 18
no 0 379 18
memory 0 379 18
of 0 379 18
the 0 379 18
event 0 379 18
ever 0 379 18
occurring, 0 379 18
including 0 379 18
a 0 379 18
female 0 379 18
friend 0 379 18
of 0 379 18
hers 0 379 18
at 0 379 18
the 0 379 18
time. 0 379 18

Two 0 379 19
of 0 379 19
those 0 379 19
named 0 379 19
have 0 379 19
stated 0 379 19

“I 0 379 20

Kavanaugh 0 379 20

“My 0 379 21

said 0 379 21
attorney 0 379 21
Eric 0 379 21
B. 0 379 21
Bruce. 0 379 21

Kavanaugh 0 379 22
also 0 379 22
said 0 379 22
he 0 379 22
would 0 379 22
be 0 379 22
cooperating 0 379 22
as 0 379 22
he 0 379 22
has 0 379 22
in 0 379 22
the 0 379 22
past. 0 379 22

“Throughout 0 379 23
this 0 379 23
process, 0 379 23
I’ve 0 379 23
been 0 379 23
interviewed 0 379 23
by 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
FBI, 0 379 23
I’ve 0 379 23
done 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
number 0 379 23
of 0 379 23
‘background’ 0 379 23
calls 0 379 23
directly 0 379 23
with 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Senate, 0 379 23
and 0 379 23
yesterday, 0 379 23
I 0 379 23
answered 0 379 23
questions 0 379 23
under 0 379 23
oath 0 379 23
about 0 379 23
every 0 379 23
topic 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Senators 0 379 23
and 0 379 23
their 0 379 23
counsel 0 379 23
asked 0 379 23
me," 0 379 23
Kavanaugh 0 379 23
said 0 379 23
in 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
statement 0 379 23
that 0 379 23
was 0 379 23
released 0 379 23
by 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
White 0 379 23
House. 0 379 23

"I’ve 0 379 24
done 0 379 24
everything 0 379 24
they 0 379 24
have 0 379 24
requested 0 379 24
and 0 379 24
will 0 379 24
continue 0 379 24
to 0 379 24
cooperate." 0 379 24

Well, 0 379 25
Senator 0 379 25
Flake 0 379 25
has 0 379 25
given 0 379 25
the 0 379 25
Democrats 0 379 25
what 0 379 25
they 0 379 25
wanted 0 379 25
and 0 379 25
you 0 379 25
can 0 379 25
bet 0 379 25
that 0 379 25
they 0 379 25
are 0 379 25
still 0 379 25
going 0 379 25
to 0 379 25
vote 0 379 25
pretty 0 379 25
much 0 379 25
on 0 379 25
party 0 379 25
lines 0 379 25
concerning 0 379 25
Kavanaugh. 0 379 25

Now, 0 379 26
President 0 379 26
Trump 0 379 26
has 0 379 26
gone 0 379 26
along 0 379 26
with 0 379 26
it. 0 379 26

My 0 379 27
guess 0 379 27
is 0 379 27
that 0 379 27
one 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
two 0 379 27
things 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
occur 0 379 27
with 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
FBI 0 379 27
investigation: 0 379 27
(1) 0 379 27
Absolutely 1 379 27
nothing 1 379 27
will 1 379 27
be 1 379 27
found, 1 379 27
and 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
have 0 379 27
been 0 379 27
a 0 379 27
huge 1 379 27
waste 1 379 27
of 1 379 27
time 1 379 27
or 0 379 27
(2) 0 379 27
look 0 379 27
for 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
thing 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
expand 0 379 27
and 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
need 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
arise 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
make 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
more 1 379 27
of 1 379 27
a 1 379 27
circus 1 379 27
than 1 379 27
it 1 379 27
already 1 379 27
is, 1 379 27
which 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
dwarf 0 379 27
anything 0 379 27
Clarence 0 379 27
Thomas 0 379 27
had 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
face 0 379 27
from 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
slanderous 1 379 27
accusations 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
Anita 0 379 27

Remember, 0 379 27

whether 0 379 27

you 0 379 27

like 0 379 27

Judge 0 379 27

Kavanaugh 0 379 27

or 0 379 27

not, 0 379 27

this 0 379 27

has 0 379 27

been 0 379 27

nothing 0 379 27

but 0 379 27

a 0 379 27

political 1 379 27

hit. 1 379 27

promising 0 380 1
to 0 380 1
drain 0 380 1
the 0 380 1

Dina 0 380 2
Powell 0 380 2
is 0 380 2
the 0 380 2
swamp. 1 380 2

You 0 380 3
can 0 380 3
see 0 380 3
her 0 380 3
out 0 380 3
there 0 380 3
at 0 380 3
the 0 380 3

Huma 0 380 3
Abedin. 0 380 3

Dina 0 380 4
Habib 0 380 4
Powell 0 380 4
was 0 380 4
an 0 380 4
influential 0 380 4
figure 0 380 4
in 0 380 4
the 0 380 4
Bush 0 380 4
administration. 0 380 4

The 0 380 5
Egyptian-American 0 380 5
immigrant 0 380 5
had 0 380 5
served 0 380 5
as 0 380 5
a 0 380 5
gatekeeper 0 380 5
for 0 380 5
George 0 380 5
W. 0 380 5
Bush. 0 380 5

If 0 380 6
you 0 380 6
wanted 0 380 6
a 0 380 6
job, 0 380 6
you 0 380 6
went 0 380 6
through 0 380 6
her. 0 380 6

Barely 0 380 7
30, 0 380 7
Habib 0 380 7
Powell 0 380 7
had 0 380 7
more 0 380 7
power 0 380 7
than 0 380 7
many 0 380 7
of 0 380 7
the 0 380 7
big 0 380 7
Bush 0 380 7
era 0 380 7
names 0 380 7
you 0 380 7
do 0 380 7
know. 0 380 7

Then 0 380 8
she 0 380 8
took 0 380 8
on 0 380 8
the 0 380 8
mission 0 380 8
of 0 380 8
promoting 0 380 8
America 0 380 8
to 0 380 8
the 0 380 8
Muslim 0 380 8
world 0 380 8
at 0 380 8
the 0 380 8
State 0 380 8
Department. 0 380 8

There 0 380 9
were 0 380 9
cultural 0 380 9
exchanges 0 380 9
with 0 380 9
Iran 0 380 9
and 0 380 9
money 0 380 9
for 0 380 9
Lebanon 0 380 9
and 0 380 9
the 0 380 9
Palestinian 0 380 9
Authority. 0 380 9

Afterward 0 380 10
it 0 380 10
was 0 380 10
off 0 380 10
to 0 380 10
make 0 380 10
millions 0 380 10
through 0 380 10
philanthropy 0 380 10
at 0 380 10
the 0 380 10
Goldman 0 380 10

Habib 0 380 11
Powell 0 380 11
had 0 380 11
all 0 380 11
the 0 380 11
right 0 380 11
friends. 0 380 11

Like 0 380 12
Valerie 0 380 12
Jarrett. 0 380 12

Arianna 0 380 13
Huffington 0 380 13
praised 0 380 13
the 0 380 13
White 0 380 13

bringing 0 380 13

who 0 380 14
made 0 380 14
the 0 380 14
Clinton 0 380 14
Foundation 0 380 14
happen 0 380 14
and 0 380 14
which 0 380 14
employed 0 380 14
Huma 0 380 14
Abedin. 0 380 14

You 0 380 15
could 0 380 15
see 0 380 15
her 0 380 15
posing 0 380 15
next 0 380 15
to 0 380 15
Huma, 0 380 15
Arianna 0 380 15
and 0 380 15
a 0 380 15
Saudi 0 380 15
princess. 0 380 15

You 0 380 16
can 0 380 16
see 0 380 16
her 0 380 16
photographed 0 380 16
at 0 380 16
the 0 380 16
American 0 380 16
Task 0 380 16
Force 0 380 16
of 0 380 16
Palestine 0 380 16
gala. 0 380 16

The 0 380 17
ATFP 0 380 17
was 0 380 17
originally 0 380 17
Rashid 0 380 17
Khalidi’s 0 380 17
American 0 380 17
Committee 0 380 17
on 0 380 17
Jerusalem. 0 380 17

Khalidi 0 380 18
was 0 380 18
the 0 380 18
former 0 380 18
PLO 0 380 18
spokesman 0 380 18
at 0 380 18
the 0 380 18
center 0 380 18
of 0 380 18
the 0 380 18
Obama 0 380 18
tape 0 380 18
scandal. 0 380 18

And 0 380 19
Habib 0 380 19
Powell 0 380 19
was 0 380 19
there 0 380 19
as 0 380 19
a 0 380 19
presenter 0 380 19
at 0 380 19
the 0 380 19
Middle 0 380 19
East 0 380 19

a 0 380 19

the 0 380 19
PLO’s 0 380 19
Hanan 0 380 19
Ashrawi. 0 380 19

Unlike 0 380 20
McFarland, 0 380 20
Habib 0 380 20
Powell 0 380 20
had 0 380 20
no 0 380 20
national 0 380 20
security 0 380 20
background. 0 380 20

But 0 380 21
though 0 380 21
her 0 380 21
parents 0 380 21
were 0 380 21
Christians, 0 380 21
she 0 380 21
had 0 380 21
the 0 380 21
“right” 0 380 21
views 0 380 21
on 0 380 21
Islam. 0 380 21

In 0 380 22
Egypt, 0 380 22
she 0 380 22
had 0 380 22
described 0 380 22
how 0 380 22
Bush 0 380 22
after 0 380 22
September 0 380 22
11 0 380 22
had, 0 380 22
“visited 0 380 22
a 0 380 22
mosque, 0 380 22
took 0 380 22
off 0 380 22
his 0 380 22
shoes 0 380 22
and 0 380 22
paid 0 380 22
his 0 380 22
respects.” 0 380 22
"I 0 380 22
see 0 380 22
the 0 380 22

as 0 380 22

I 0 380 22

him 0 380 22
host 0 380 22
an 0 380 22

Habib 0 380 22
Powell 0 380 22

attended 0 380 22
such 0 380 22
an 0 380 22

Habib 0 380 23
Powell 0 380 23
has 0 380 23
been 0 380 23
described 0 380 23
as 0 380 23
the 0 380 23
Republican 0 380 23
Huma 0 380 23
Abedin. 0 380 23

And 0 380 24
she 0 380 24
was 0 380 24
quoted 0 380 24
as 0 380 24
saying 0 380 24
that 0 380 24
Abedin 0 380 24
“feels 0 380 24
a 0 380 24
deep 0 380 24
responsibility 0 380 24

And 0 380 25
Powell 0 380 25
has 0 380 25
been 0 380 25
on 0 380 25
cheerful 0 380 25

Ambassador 0 380 27
Samantha 0 380 27
Power 0 380 27
for 0 380 27
an 0 380 27
interview. 0 380 27

In 0 380 28
that 0 380 28
interview, 0 380 28
Powell 0 380 28
heaped 0 380 28
effusive 0 380 28
praise 0 380 28
upon 0 380 28
Power 0 380 28
and 0 380 28
can 0 380 28
be 0 380 28
seen 0 380 28
nodding 0 380 28
in 0 380 28
agreement 0 380 28
throughout. 0 380 28

Power 0 380 29
was 0 380 29
a 0 380 29
senior 0 380 29
adviser 0 380 29
to 0 380 29
President 0 380 29
Barack 0 380 29
Obama. 0 380 29

At 0 380 30
the 0 380 30
time, 0 380 30
Powell 0 380 30
– 0 380 30
an 0 380 30
executive 0 380 30
with 0 380 30
Goldman 0 380 30
Sachs 0 380 30
– 0 380 30
was 0 380 30
pushing 0 380 30
a 0 380 30
pet 0 380 30
project 0 380 30
known 0 380 30
as 0 380 30
10,000 0 380 30
women, 0 380 30
which 0 380 30
is 0 380 30
ostensibly 0 380 30
intended 0 380 30
to 0 380 30
foster 0 380 30
female 0 380 30
entrepreneurship. 0 380 30

When 0 380 31
Powell 0 380 31
was 0 380 31
at 0 380 31
Goldman 0 380 31
Sachs, 0 380 31
her 0 380 31
right-hand 0 380 31
woman 0 380 31
in 0 380 31
the 0 380 31

Women 0 380 31

was 0 380 31
Noa 0 380 31
Meyer. 0 380 31

Perhaps 0 380 32
not 0 380 32
so 0 380 32
coincidentally, 0 380 32
Meyer 0 380 32
worked 0 380 32
in 0 380 32
the 0 380 32
Bill 0 380 32
Clinton 0 380 32
administration’s 0 380 32
speech-writing 0 380 32

of 0 380 32
then 0 380 32
first-lady 0 380 32
Hillary 0 380 32
Clinton. 0 380 32

Powell 0 380 33
herself, 0 380 33
is 0 380 33
very 0 380 33
comfortable 0 380 33
with 0 380 33
Hillary 0 380 33
Clinton. 0 380 33

In 0 380 34
2013, 0 380 34
she 0 380 34
shared 0 380 34
a 0 380 34
stage 0 380 34
with 0 380 34
Hillary 0 380 34
at 0 380 34
the 0 380 34
Clinton 0 380 34
Global 0 380 34
Initiative. 0 380 34

In 0 380 35
2007, 0 380 35
Powell 0 380 35
was 0 380 35
named 0 380 35
to 0 380 35
the 0 380 35
Board 0 380 35
of 0 380 35
a 0 380 35
Hillary 0 380 35
Clinton 0 380 35
project 0 380 35
known 0 380 35
as 0 380 35
‘Vital 0 380 35
Voices’,another 0 380 35
women-centric 1 380 35
operation 0 380 35
that 0 380 35
touts 0 380 35
Global 0 380 35
Ambassadorial 0 380 35
missions 0 380 35
for 0 380 35
women. 0 380 35

On 0 380 36
June 0 380 36
14, 0 380 36
2016 0 380 36
Powell 0 380 36
participated 0 380 36
in 0 380 36
a 0 380 36
Summit 0 380 36
known 0 380 36
as 0 380 36
the 0 380 36
United 0 380 36
State 0 380 36
of 0 380 36
Women(USW), 0 380 36
which 0 380 36
meshed 1 380 36
nicely 1 380 36
with 0 380 36
her 0 380 36
pet 0 380 36
project. 0 380 36

USW 0 380 37
was 0 380 37
also 0 380 37
rife 0 380 37
with 0 380 37
angry 1 380 37
left-wing 1 380 37
Democrats 1 380 37
seeking 0 380 37
to 0 380 37
get 0 380 37
Hillary 0 380 37
Clinton 0 380 37
elected 0 380 37
in 0 380 37
2016. 0 380 37

In 0 380 38
fact, 0 380 38
Barack 0 380 38
Obama’s 0 380 38
closest 0 380 38
adviser 0 380 38
Valerie 0 380 38
Jarrett 0 380 38
introduced 0 380 38
Powell, 0 380 38
who 0 380 38
returned 0 380 38
the 0 380 38
introduction 0 380 38
with 0 380 38
effusive 0 380 38
praise 0 380 38
for 0 380 38
Jarrett. 0 380 38

The 0 380 39
ex-Goldman 0 380 39
Sachs 0 380 39
executive 0 380 39
has 0 380 39
befriended 0 380 39
Obama’s 0 380 39
closest 0 380 39
adviser, 0 380 39
Valerie 0 380 39
Jarrett. 0 380 39

She 0 380 40
is 0 380 40
also 0 380 40
very 0 380 40
cozy 0 380 40
with 0 380 40
Hillary 0 380 40
Clinton’s 0 380 40
closest 0 380 40
advisers 0 380 40
Huma 0 380 40
Abedin 0 380 40
and 0 380 40
Philippe 0 380 40
Reines. 0 380 40

Now 0 380 41
there's 0 380 41
once 0 380 41
again 0 380 41
talk 0 380 41
of 0 380 41
moving 0 380 41
Dina 0 380 41
Powell 0 380 41
in. 0 380 41

This 0 380 42
time 0 380 42
into 0 380 42
Nikki 0 380 42
Halley's 0 380 42
old 0 380 42
spot 0 380 42
as 0 380 42
UN 0 380 42
Ambassador. 0 380 42

The 0 380 43
talk 0 380 43
comes 0 380 43
from 0 380 43
the 0 380 43
GOP 0 380 43
establishment. 0 380 43

Powell 0 380 44
should 0 380 44
not 0 380 44
be 0 380 44
at 0 380 44
the 0 380 44
NSC, 0 380 44
where 0 380 44
she 0 380 44
replaced 0 380 44
K.T. 0 380 44

McFarland, 0 380 45
who 0 380 45
was 0 380 45
qualified 0 380 45
for 0 380 45
the 0 380 45
job, 0 380 45
at 0 380 45
the 0 380 45
behest 0 380 45
of 0 380 45
H.R. 0 380 45

McMaster. 0 380 46

But 0 380 47
every 0 380 47
job 0 380 47
for 0 380 47
Powell 0 380 47
is 0 380 47
a 0 380 47
stepping 0 380 47
stone 0 380 47
to 0 380 47
the 0 380 47
next 0 380 47
one. 0 380 47

And 0 380 48
the 0 380 48
one 0 380 48
she 0 380 48
has 0 380 48
her 0 380 48
eyes 0 380 48
on 0 380 48
now 0 380 48
would 0 380 48
be 0 380 48
an 0 380 48
even 1 380 48
bigger 1 380 48
disaster. 1 380 48

Making 0 380 49
Dina 0 380 49
Powell 0 380 49
the 0 380 49
US 0 380 49
Ambassador 0 380 49
to 0 380 49
the 0 380 49
UN 0 380 49
would 0 380 49
quickly 0 380 49
undo 0 380 49
all 0 380 49
the 0 380 49
progress 0 380 49
that 0 380 49
Haley 0 380 49
made. 0 380 49

Before 0 380 50
long 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
US 0 380 50
would 0 380 50
be 0 380 50
right 0 380 50
back 0 380 50
in 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
Human 0 380 50
Rights 0 380 50
Council, 0 380 50
there 0 380 50
would 0 380 50
be 0 380 50
moves 0 380 50
in 0 380 50
favor 0 380 50
of 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
PLO, 0 380 50
and 0 380 50
the 0 380 50
same 1 380 50
old 1 380 50
failed 1 380 50
politics 1 380 50
would 0 380 50
be 0 380 50
back. 0 380 50

Haley 0 380 51
sent 0 380 51
a 0 380 51
message 0 380 51
that 0 380 51
UN 0 380 51
members 0 380 51
will 0 380 51
be 0 380 51
punished 0 380 51
if 0 380 51
they 0 380 51
push 0 380 51
the 0 380 51
US 0 380 51
around. 0 380 51

Powell 0 380 52
would 0 380 52
swiftly 1 380 52
undo 1 380 52
that. 0 380 52

Dina 0 380 53
Powell 0 380 53
would 0 380 53
have 0 380 53
been 0 380 53
a 0 380 53
Jeb 0 380 53
Bush 0 380 53
appointee. 0 380 53

Appointing 1 380 54
her 1 380 54
to 1 380 54
the 1 380 54
UN 1 380 54
would 1 380 54
give 1 380 54
Trump, 1 380 54
Jeb 1 380 54
Bush's 1 380 54
policies. 1 380 54

You 0 380 55
don't 0 380 55
drain 0 380 55
the 0 380 55
swamp 0 380 55
by 0 380 55
appointing 0 380 55
the 0 380 55
swamp. 0 380 55

And 0 380 55

Powell 0 380 55

is 0 380 55

one 1 380 55

of 1 380 55

the 1 380 55

deep 0 381 5

shortly 0 385 10
before 0 385 10

out 0 385 10

the 0 385 10
reports 0 385 10

Saudi 0 385 11
officials 0 385 11

that 0 385 11
Khashoggi 0 385 11
left 0 385 11

for 0 385 12

Hoping 0 385 13
to 0 385 13

growing 0 385 13
furor, 0 385 13
Trump 0 385 13
on 0 385 13
Monday 0 385 13
suggested 0 385 13
“rogue 0 385 13

not 0 385 13
the 0 385 13
Saudi 0 385 13

carried 0 385 13
out 0 385 13
the 0 385 13
murder. 0 385 13

Critics 0 385 14
quickly 0 385 14
said 0 385 14
that 0 385 14
Trump 0 385 14
was 0 385 14
providing 0 385 14
an 0 385 14
excuse 0 385 14
for 0 385 14
the 0 385 14
Saudi 0 385 14

set 0 385 15
the 0 385 15
stage 0 385 15
for 0 385 15
Saudi 0 385 15
officials 0 385 15
to 0 385 15
find 0 385 15
a 0 385 15
way 0 385 15
to 0 385 15
explain 0 385 15
away 0 385 15
the 0 385 15
alleged 0 385 15
shocking 1 385 15
death. 1 385 15

They 0 385 16
floated 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
idea 0 385 16
later 0 385 16
Monday 0 385 16
of 0 385 16
claiming 0 385 16

wrote 0 385 16

pieces 0 385 16
for 0 385 16

and 0 385 16
Arab 0 385 16

was 0 385 16
accidentally 0 385 16
killed 0 385 16
in 0 385 16
an 0 385 16
interrogation 0 385 16
gone 0 385 16
awry 0 385 16
inside 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
consulate 0 385 16
— 0 385 16
supposedly 0 385 16
without 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
approval 0 385 16
of 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
king 0 385 16
or 0 385 16
crown 0 385 16
prince. 0 385 16

Publicly, 0 385 17
Pompeo 0 385 17
and 0 385 17
his 0 385 17
hosts 0 385 17
looked 0 385 17
calm 0 385 17
and 0 385 17
friendly 0 385 17
when 0 385 17
they 0 385 17
met 0 385 17
Tuesday 0 385 17
in 0 385 17
Riyadh. 0 385 17

At 0 385 18
one 0 385 18
point, 0 385 18
as 0 385 18
they 0 385 18
greeted 0 385 18
each 0 385 18
other, 0 385 18
Prince 0 385 18
Mohammed 0 385 18
noted 0 385 18
the 0 385 18
two 0 385 18
countries 0 385 18
were 0 385 18
important 0 385 18
allies. 0 385 18

“Absolutely,” 0 385 19
Pompeo 0 385 19
said, 0 385 19
smiling. 0 385 19

The 0 385 20
United 0 385 20
States 0 385 20
long 0 385 20
guaranteed 0 385 20
Saudi 0 385 20
security 0 385 20
in 0 385 20
exchange 0 385 20
for 0 385 20
a 0 385 20
steady 0 385 20
supply 0 385 20
of 0 385 20
oil. 0 385 20

Those 0 385 21
ties 0 385 21
have 0 385 21
frayed 0 385 21
even 0 385 21
as 0 385 21
the 0 385 21
Trump 0 385 21
administration 0 385 21
has 0 385 21
embraced 0 385 21
the 0 385 21
Saudi 0 385 21
rulers 0 385 21
as 0 385 21
a 0 385 21
crucial 0 385 21
regional 0 385 21
ally 0 385 21
in 0 385 21
efforts 0 385 21
to 0 385 21
constrain 0 385 21
Iran 0 385 21
and 0 385 21
to 0 385 21
craft 0 385 21
a 0 385 21
peace 0 385 21
plan 0 385 21
between 0 385 21
Israel 0 385 21
and 0 385 21
the 0 385 21
Palestinians. 0 385 21

The 0 385 22
current 0 385 22
crisis 0 385 22
has 0 385 22
put 0 385 22
those 0 385 22
broader 0 385 22
goals 0 385 22
at 0 385 22
risk, 0 385 22
and 0 385 22
the 0 385 22
White 0 385 22
House 0 385 22
has 0 385 22
scrambled 0 385 22
to 0 385 22
find 0 385 22
a 0 385 22
face-saving 0 385 22
solution 0 385 22
for 0 385 22
the 0 385 22
Saudi 0 385 22
rulers. 0 385 22

Trump 0 385 23
has 0 385 23
said 0 385 23
he 0 385 23
would 0 385 23
impose 0 385 23
“severe” 1 385 23
punishment 0 385 23
if 0 385 23
proof 0 385 23
emerges 0 385 23
that 0 385 23
Saudi 0 385 23
rulers 0 385 23
sanctioned 0 385 23
Khashoggi’s 0 385 23
murder, 0 385 23
but 0 385 23
he 0 385 23
has 0 385 23
not 0 385 23
said 0 385 23
what 0 385 23
that 0 385 23
would 0 385 23
entail. 0 385 23

He 0 385 24
has 0 385 24
ruled 0 385 24
out 0 385 24
cancelling 0 385 24
or 0 385 24
suspending 0 385 24
billions 0 385 24

deals 0 385 24
with 0 385 24
the 0 385 24
oil-rich 0 385 24
country. 0 385 24

Many 0 385 25
members 0 385 25
of 0 385 25
Congress 0 385 25
have 0 385 25
demanded 0 385 25
the 0 385 25
White 0 385 25
House 0 385 25
take 0 385 25
tougher 0 385 25
actions, 0 385 25
including 0 385 25
punitive 0 385 25
sanctions 0 385 25
on 0 385 25
Saudi 0 385 25
rulers. 0 385 25

But 0 385 26
Congress 0 385 26
has 0 385 26
taken 0 385 26
no 0 385 26
action 0 385 26

Michael 0 83 1

Pompeo 0 83 1

confidence 0 83 1
Wednesday 0 83 1
that 0 83 1

be 0 83 1
trusted 0 83 1

in 0 83 1

the 0 83 1
likelihood 0 83 1
that 0 83 1
senior 0 83 1

involved. 0 83 1

Speaking 0 83 2
in 0 83 2

Turkey, 0 83 2
Pompeo 0 83 2
offered 0 83 2
that 0 83 2
support 0 83 2
hours 0 83 2
after 0 83 2
President 0 83 2
Donald 0 83 2

mounted 0 83 2
an 0 83 2

stronger 0 83 2
defense 0 83 2
for 0 83 2
the 0 83 2

“Here 0 83 2

you’re 0 83 2

Together 0 83 3
they 0 83 3
appeared 0 83 3
to 0 83 3

a 0 83 3

face 0 83 3
“severe 1 83 3

the 0 83 3

Neither 0 83 5

up 1 83 9
with 1 83 9

on 0 83 10

Erdogan 0 83 11
later 0 83 11
complained 0 83 11
that 0 83 11
the 0 83 11
interior 0 83 11

been 0 83 11
repainted 0 83 11
in 0 83 11
recent 0 83 11
days. 0 83 11

On 0 83 12
his 0 83 12

from 0 83 12
Riyadh 0 83 12
to 0 83 12
Ankara, 0 83 12
Pompeo 1 83 12
reiterated 1 83 12
his 1 83 12
confidence 1 83 12
that 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
Saudi 1 83 12
government 1 83 12
would 1 83 12
conduct 1 83 12
a 1 83 12
“thorough, 1 83 12
complete, 1 83 12
and 1 83 12
transparent 1 83 12
investigation,” 1 83 12
adding 1 83 12
that 1 83 12
they 1 83 12
will 1 83 12
“show 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
entire 1 83 12
world” 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
results. 1 83 12

He 0 83 13
said 0 83 13
Saudi 0 83 13
leaders 0 83 13
made 0 83 13
a 0 83 13
commitment 0 83 13
“to 0 83 13
hold 0 83 13
anyone 0 83 13

or 0 83 13
official.” 0 83 13
He 0 83 13
said 0 83 13
they 0 83 13
made 0 83 13
“no 0 83 13
exceptions,” 0 83 13
including 0 83 13
presumably 0 83 13
members 0 83 13
of 0 83 13
the 0 83 13
royal 0 83 13
family. 0 83 13

Asked 0 83 14
if 0 83 14
the 0 83 14
Saudis 0 83 14
had 0 83 14
informed 0 83 14
him 0 83 14
whether 0 83 14
Khashoggi 0 83 14
was 0 83 14
alive 0 83 14
or 0 83 14
dead, 0 83 14
Pompeo 0 83 14
said, 0 83 14
“I 0 83 14
don’t 0 83 14
want 0 83 14

about 0 83 14
any 0 83 14
of 0 83 14

They 0 83 15
didn’t 0 83 15
want 0 83 15
to 0 83 15
either, 0 83 15
in 0 83 15
that 0 83 15
they 0 83 15

have 0 83 15
the 0 83 15
opportunity 0 83 15
to 0 83 15

this 0 83 15
investigation 0 83 15
in 0 83 15
a 0 83 15
thorough 0 83 15
way.” 0 83 15

Asked 0 83 16
if 0 83 16
he 0 83 16
believed 0 83 16
the 0 83 16
Saudi 0 83 16
rulers’ 0 83 16
repeated 0 83 16
denial 0 83 16
of 0 83 16
complicity, 0 83 16
Pompeo 0 83 16
said 0 83 16
he 0 83 16
was 0 83 16
reserving 0 83 16
judgment. 0 83 16

without 0 83 24
decisive 0 83 24

Saudi 0 83 25
leaders 0 83 25
for 0 83 25
two 0 83 25
weeks 0 83 25
denied 0 83 25
knowing 0 83 25
anything 0 83 25
about 0 83 25
the 0 83 25
Khashoggi 0 83 25
case. 0 83 25

On 0 83 26
Monday, 0 83 26
they 0 83 26
began 0 83 26
floating 0 83 26
a 0 83 26
scenario 0 83 26
— 0 83 26
initially 0 83 26
adopted 0 83 26
by 0 83 26
Trump 0 83 26
— 0 83 26
that 0 83 26
blamed 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
murder 0 83 26
inside 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
consulate 0 83 26
on 0 83 26
“rogue 0 83 26
killers,” 0 83 26
and 0 83 26
then 0 83 26
suggested 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
writer 0 83 26
was 0 83 26
accidentally 0 83 26
killed 0 83 26
during 0 83 26
an 0 83 26
interrogation 0 83 26
that 0 83 26
went 0 83 26
awry. 0 83 26

familiar 0 83 27
with 0 83 27
the 0 83 27
desert 0 83 27
kingdom 0 83 27
said 0 83 27
it 0 83 27
was 0 83 27
likely 0 83 27
Saudi 0 83 27
leaders 0 83 27
were 0 83 27
hoping 0 83 27
the 0 83 27
scandal 0 83 27
would 0 83 27
blow 0 83 27
over 0 83 27
and 0 83 27
that 0 83 27
they 0 83 27
could 0 83 27
wait 0 83 27
it 0 83 27
out. 0 83 27

“We 0 83 28
received 0 83 28
commitments 0 83 28
that 0 83 28

that,” 0 83 28
Pompeo 0 83 28
said. 0 83 28

The 0 389 31
obvious 0 389 31
question 0 389 31
I 0 389 31
have 0 389 31
is: 0 389 31
Why 0 389 31
are 0 389 31
you 0 389 31
not 0 389 31
stopping 0 389 31
those 0 389 31
payments 0 389 31
now, 0 389 31
Mr. 0 389 31
President? 0 389 31

They 0 389 32
are 0 389 32
unconstitutional 1 389 32
and 0 389 32
neither 0 389 32
Congress 0 389 32
nor 0 389 32
you 0 389 32
have 0 389 32
the 0 389 32
authority 0 389 32
to 0 389 32
give 0 389 32
American's 1 389 32
money 0 389 32
to 0 389 32
these 0 389 32
countries. 0 389 32

Trump 0 389 33
also 0 389 33
seemed 0 389 33
ready 0 389 33
to 0 389 33
back 0 389 33
out 0 389 33
on 0 389 33
his 0 389 33
new 0 389 33
trade 0 389 33
deal, 0 389 33
which 0 389 33
is 0 389 33
hardly 0 389 33
a 0 389 33
deal 0 389 33
for 0 389 33
the 0 389 33
US, 0 389 33
with 0 389 33
Mexico 0 389 33
if 0 389 33
they 0 389 33
failed 0 389 33
to 0 389 33
stop 0 389 33
the 0 389 33
caravan. 0 389 33

He 0 389 34
then 0 389 34
pointed 0 389 34
out 0 389 34
that 0 389 34
many 0 389 34
who 0 389 34
cross 0 389 34
the 0 389 34
border 0 389 34
are 0 389 34
criminals 0 389 34

are 0 389 34

to 1 389 34

that 0 390 2
the 0 390 2

little 0 390 3
value 0 390 3

opposing 0 390 3
the 0 390 3
threat 0 390 3
of 0 390 3
a 0 390 3
closed 0 390 3

Even 1 390 4
today, 1 390 4
there 1 390 4

there 1 390 5

of 0 390 11
multiple 0 390 11

a 0 390 11
massive 0 390 11
campaign 0 390 11
of 0 390 11
“fake 0 390 11
news” 0 390 11
awareness. 0 390 11

One 0 390 12
thing 0 390 12
we 0 390 12
need 0 390 12
to 0 390 12
remember 0 390 12
here 0 390 12
is, 0 390 12
this 0 390 12
isn’t 0 390 12
about 0 390 12
democrats 0 390 12
vs 0 390 12
republicans, 0 390 12
it’s 0 390 12
about 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
elite 1 390 12
preserving 0 390 12
their 0 390 12
control, 0 390 12
and 0 390 12
at 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
moment, 0 390 12
they 0 390 12
are 0 390 12
using 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
DNC 0 390 12
as 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
mouthpiece 0 390 12
for 0 390 12
that. 0 390 12

Thus, 0 390 13
anything 0 390 13
that 0 390 13
slandered 0 390 13
Hillary 0 390 13
Clinton 0 390 13
during 0 390 13
the 0 390 13
presidential 0 390 13
campaign, 0 390 13
for 0 390 13
example, 0 390 13
was 0 390 13
labelled 0 390 13
as 0 390 13
fake 0 390 13

even 0 390 13
if 0 390 13
evidence 0 390 13
and 0 390 13
credible 0 390 13
sources 0 390 13
were 0 390 13
used. 0 390 13

This 0 390 14
is 0 390 14
because 0 390 14
she 0 390 14
is 0 390 14
part 0 390 14
of 0 390 14
that 0 390 14
elite. 1 390 14

This 0 390 15
is 0 390 15
cyber 0 390 15
false 0 390 15
flagging 0 390 15

where 0 390 15

not, 0 390 15

what 0 390 18

still 0 390 18

take 0 390 18
on 0 390 18

at 0 390 33
the 0 390 33
moment 0 390 33
it 0 390 33
seems 0 390 33
to 0 390 33
be 0 390 33
censoring 0 390 33
of 0 390 33

Their 0 390 34
key 0 390 34

is 0 390 34
to 0 390 34
label 0 390 34
everything 0 390 34

became 0 390 35
extremely 0 390 35

suits 0 390 39
the 0 390 39
Deep 0 390 39
State’s 0 390 39
best 0 390 39
interests. 0 390 39

There 0 390 40
are 0 390 40
several 0 390 40
examples 0 390 40
from 0 390 40
all 0 390 40
fields 0 390 40
that 0 390 40
surround 0 390 40
human 0 390 40
life, 0 390 40
from 0 390 40
healthcare 0 390 40
to 0 390 40
politics, 0 390 40
and 0 390 40
it 0 390 40
all 0 390 40
seems 0 390 40
to 0 390 40
be 0 390 40
controlled 0 390 40
by 0 390 40
one 0 390 40
massive 0 390 40
conglomerate 0 390 40
at 0 390 40
the 0 390 40
top. 0 390 40

We’ve 0 390 41
been 0 390 41
writing 0 390 41
about 0 390 41
this 0 390 41
for 0 390 41
nearly 0 390 41
a 0 390 41
decade 0 390 41
now. 0 390 41

The 0 390 42
Deep 0 390 42
State 0 390 42
Has 0 390 42
Power 0 390 42
Due 0 390 42
To 0 390 42
Our 0 390 42
Unconsciousness 0 390 42

They 0 390 43
(global 1 390 43
elite) 1 390 43
continue 0 390 43
to 0 390 43
do 0 390 43
what 0 390 43
they 0 390 43
are 0 390 43
able 0 390 43
to 0 390 43
do 0 390 43
because 0 390 43
of 0 390 43
human 0 390 43
consciousness. 0 390 43

The 0 390 44
more 0 390 44
people 0 390 44
who 0 390 44
consider 0 390 44
this 0 390 44
a 0 390 44
“conspiracy 0 390 44
theory” 0 390 44
and 0 390 44
turn 0 390 44
their 0 390 44
heads 0 390 44
away, 0 390 44
the 0 390 44
easier 0 390 44
it 0 390 44
is 0 390 44
for 0 390 44
them 0 390 44
to 0 390 44
continue 0 390 44
and 0 390 44
have 0 390 44
power. 0 390 44

I 0 390 45
don’t 0 390 45
understand 0 390 45
how 0 390 45
so 0 390 45
much 0 390 45
information 0 390 45
can 0 390 45
come 0 390 45
to 0 390 45
light, 0 390 45
yet 0 390 45
when 0 390 45
it’s 0 390 45
deemed 0 390 45
a 0 390 45
“conspiracy” 0 390 45
theory” 0 390 45
within 0 390 45
mainstream 0 390 45
media, 0 390 45
everybody 0 390 45
simply 0 390 45
follows 0 390 45
the 0 390 45
rhetoric, 0 390 45
without 0 390 45
doing 0 390 45
any 0 390 45
investigation 0 390 45
or 0 390 45
research 0 390 45
for 0 390 45
themselves. 0 390 45

If 0 390 46
you 0 390 46
don’t 0 390 46
look 0 390 46
into 0 390 46
it, 0 390 46
don’t 0 390 46
share 0 390 46
an 0 390 46
opinion 0 390 46
on 0 390 46
it. 0 390 46

“Condemnation 0 390 47
without 0 390 47
investigation 0 390 47
is 0 390 47
the 0 390 47
height 0 390 47
of 0 390 47
ignorance.” 0 390 47
– 0 390 47
Einstein. 0 390 47

All 0 390 48
of 0 390 48
these 0 390 48
media 0 390 48
sources 0 390 48
were 0 390 48
operating 0 390 48
normally 0 390 48
until 0 390 48
Donald 0 390 48
Trump 0 390 48
became 0 390 48
president, 0 390 48
and 0 390 48
until 0 390 48
Hillary 0 390 48
Clinton, 0 390 48
Obama, 0 390 48
Bush, 0 390 48
etc 0 390 48
were 0 390 48
outed 0 390 48
as 0 390 48
global 1 390 48
elite 1 390 48
puppets. 1 390 48

Heck, 0 390 49
the 0 390 49
Clinton’s 0 390 49
and 0 390 49
John 0 390 49
Podesta 0 390 49
have 0 390 49
even 0 390 49
referenced 0 390 49
Wikileaks 0 390 49
before 0 390 49
that 0 390 49
became 0 390 49
‘fake.’ 0 390 49
Despite 0 390 49
operating 0 390 49
with 0 390 49
credibility 0 390 49
for 0 390 49
more 0 390 49
than 0 390 49
a 0 390 49
decade 0 390 49
before 0 390 49
the 0 390 49
accusations. 0 390 49

What 0 390 50
does 0 390 50
the 0 390 50
media 0 390 50
operating 0 390 50
normally 0 390 50
mean? 0 390 50

Still 0 390 51
manipulating 0 390 51
the 0 390 51
public, 0 390 51
but 0 390 51
at 0 390 51
least 0 390 51
they 0 390 51
were 0 390 51
reporting 0 390 51
on 0 390 51
both 0 390 51
sides 0 390 51
as 0 390 51
a 0 390 51
whole. 0 390 51

Now, 0 390 52
it’s 0 390 52
quite 0 390 52
different. 0 390 52

Donald 0 390 53
Trump 0 390 53
is 0 390 53
extremely 1 390 53
vilified 1 390 53
not 0 390 53
because 0 390 53
he 0 390 53
allegedly 0 390 53
is/was 0 390 53
racist/sexist, 0 390 53
but 0 390 53
because 1 390 53
he 1 390 53
threatens 1 390 53
neoliberalism 1 390 53
and 1 390 53
neoconservatism, 1 390 53
the 1 390 53
American 1 390 53
empire, 1 390 53
one 0 390 53
that 0 390 53
continues 0 390 53
to 0 390 53
try 0 390 53
and 0 390 53
push 0 390 53
an 0 390 53
Orwellian 0 390 53
state 0 390 53
type 0 390 53
of 0 390 53
existence, 0 390 53
which 0 390 53
seems 0 390 53
to 0 390 53
be 0 390 53
ramping 0 390 53
up 0 390 53
every 0 390 53
single 0 390 53
year. 0 390 53

Trump 0 390 54
was 0 390 54
not 0 390 54
supposed 0 390 54
to 0 390 54
win, 0 390 54
and 0 390 54
no 1 390 54
this 1 390 54
isn’t 1 390 54
about 1 390 54
democrats 1 390 54
vs 1 390 54
republicans 1 390 54
or 0 390 54
that 0 390 54
Trump 0 390 54
is 0 390 54
a 1 390 54
saviour. 1 390 54

The 0 390 55
Deep 0 390 55
State 0 390 55
responded 0 390 55
like 0 390 55
they 0 390 55
always 0 390 55
do 0 390 55
every 0 390 55
time 0 390 55
something 0 390 55
‘goes 0 390 55
wrong,’ 0 390 55
they 0 390 55
blamed 0 390 55
Russia, 0 390 55
as 0 390 55
well 0 390 55
as 0 390 55
media 0 390 55
outlets 0 390 55
like 0 390 55
Collective 0 390 55
Evolution 0 390 55
and 0 390 55
others. 0 390 55

Some 0 390 56
of 0 390 56
which 0 390 56
have 0 390 56
now 0 390 56
been 0 390 56
deleted 0 390 56
as 0 390 56
mentioned 0 390 56
above. 0 390 56

Trump 1 390 57
is 1 390 57
Not 1 390 57
The 1 390 57
Solution, 1 390 57
We 1 390 57
Are 1 390 57

Things 0 390 58
are 0 390 58
getting 0 390 58
pretty 1 390 58
ridiculous, 1 390 58
but 0 390 58
they’re 0 390 58
too 0 390 58
late. 0 390 58

Even 0 390 59
if 0 390 59
they 0 390 59
do 0 390 59
succeed 0 390 59
in 0 390 59
deleting 0 390 59
more 0 390 59
independent 0 390 59
media 0 390 59
sites 0 390 59
from 0 390 59
social 0 390 59
media, 0 390 59
they 0 390 59
cannot 0 390 59
erase 0 390 59
them 0 390 59
from 0 390 59
the 0 390 59
internet. 0 390 59

Yes, 0 390 60
social 0 390 60
media 0 390 60
platforms 0 390 60
were 0 390 60
great 0 390 60
for 0 390 60
spreading 0 390 60
information 0 390 60
across 0 390 60
the 0 390 60
internet 0 390 60
and 0 390 60
for 0 390 60
having 0 390 60
more 0 390 60
people 0 390 60
become 0 390 60
aware 0 390 60
of 0 390 60
it. 0 390 60

It 0 390 61
really 0 390 61
showed 0 390 61
what 0 390 61
people 0 390 61
were 0 390 61
interested 0 390 61
in, 0 390 61
and 0 390 61
what 0 390 61
people 0 390 61
wanted 0 390 61
to 0 390 61
see, 0 390 61
but 0 390 61
clearly, 0 390 61
we 1 390 61
do 1 390 61
not 1 390 61
live 1 390 61
in 1 390 61
a 1 390 61
democracy 1 390 61
and 0 390 61
that 0 390 61
doesn’t 0 390 61

going 0 390 63

of 0 390 63

given 0 390 63
the 0 390 63
fact 0 390 63
that 0 390 63
what 0 390 63
they 0 390 63
see 0 390 63
coming 0 390 63
from 0 390 63
the 0 390 63

is 0 390 63
usually 0 390 63
highly 0 390 63
suspect 0 390 63
and 0 390 63
questionable. 0 390 63

More 0 390 64
and 0 390 64
more 0 390 64
people 0 390 64
see 0 390 64
it 0 390 64
this 0 390 64
way 0 390 64
because 0 390 64
our 0 390 64
consciousness 0 390 64
continues 0 390 64
to 0 390 64
shift. 0 390 64

Social 0 390 65
media 0 390 65
platforms 0 390 65
do 0 390 65
not 0 390 65
control 0 390 65
the 0 390 65
awakening 0 390 65
but 0 390 65
have 0 390 65
been 0 390 65
a 0 390 65
great 0 390 65
tool 0 390 65
to 0 390 65
grow 0 390 65
it, 0 390 65
but 0 390 65
it’s 0 390 65
something 0 390 65
that 0 390 65
cannot 0 390 65
be 0 390 65
stopped. 0 390 65

The 0 390 66
more 0 390 66
we 0 390 66
awaken 0 390 66
and 0 390 66
truly 0 390 66
see 0 390 66
past 0 390 66
the 0 390 66
political 0 390 66

the 0 390 66
more 0 390 66
we 0 390 66

from 0 390 66
the 0 390 66

this 0 390 66

2020 0 390 67

Now, 0 390 68
all 0 390 68
of 0 390 68
this 0 390 68
seems 0 390 68
to 0 390 68
be 0 390 68
taking 0 390 68
place 0 390 68
with 0 390 68
perfect 0 390 68
timing 0 390 68
before 0 390 68
the 0 390 68
2020 0 390 68
election. 0 390 68

No 0 390 69
doubt 0 390 69
that 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
Deep 0 390 69
State 0 390 69
will 0 390 69
want 0 390 69
to 0 390 69
take 0 390 69
back 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
presidency, 0 390 69
but 0 390 69
ultimately, 0 390 69
we 0 390 69
need 0 390 69
to 0 390 69
see 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
bigger 0 390 69
picture 0 390 69
here. 0 390 69

We 0 390 70
need 0 390 70
to 0 390 70
see 0 390 70
what 0 390 70
politics 0 390 70
actually 0 390 70
is, 0 390 70
and 0 390 70
the 0 390 70
past 0 390 70
few 0 390 70
years 0 390 70
alone 0 390 70
have 0 390 70
provided 0 390 70
us 0 390 70
with 0 390 70
the 0 390 70
opportunity 0 390 70
to 0 390 70
see. 0 390 70

It’s 0 390 71
nothing 0 390 71
but 0 390 71
elite 1 390 71
people, 0 390 71
corporations 0 390 71
and 0 390 71
the 0 390 71
financial 0 390 71
elite 1 390 71
that 0 390 71
have 0 390 71
become 0 390 71
drenched 0 390 71
with 0 390 71
so 0 390 71
much 0 390 71
power 0 390 71
that 0 390 71
they 0 390 71
have 0 390 71
been 0 390 71
able 0 390 71
to 0 390 71
direct 0 390 71
human 0 390 71
will 0 390 71
and 0 390 71
use 0 390 71
it 0 390 71
for 0 390 71
their 0 390 71
own 0 390 71
selfish 0 390 71
purposes. 0 390 71

With 0 390 72
powerful 1 390 72
revelations 0 390 72
that 0 390 72
have 0 390 72
come 0 390 72
to 0 390 72
light, 0 390 72
like 0 390 72
elite 1 390 72
pedophilia 1 390 72
and 0 390 72
ritual 1 390 72
abuse, 1 390 72
and 0 390 72
extreme 1 390 72
corruption, 0 390 72
why 0 390 72
do 0 390 72
we 0 390 72
still 0 390 72
participate? 0 390 72

Why 0 390 73
do 0 390 73
we 0 390 73
choose 0 390 73
to 0 390 73
elect 0 390 73
these 0 390 73
people? 0 390 73

Why 0 390 74
do 0 390 74
we 0 390 74
believe 0 390 74
we 0 390 74
live 0 390 74
in 0 390 74
a 0 390 74
democracy 0 390 74

Why 0 390 75
are 0 390 75
harmful 1 390 75
‘things’ 0 390 75
surrounding 0 390 75
us 0 390 75
constantly 0 390 75
when 0 390 75
we 0 390 75
have 0 390 75
science 0 390 75
showing 0 390 75
it’s 0 390 75
not 0 390 75

like 0 390 75
cell 0 390 75
phone 0 390 75

etc. 0 390 75

It’s 0 390 76
simply 0 390 76
because 0 390 76
power 0 390 76
lies 0 390 76
within 0 390 76
the 0 390 76
corporatocracy. 0 390 76

Decisions 0 390 77
aren’t 0 390 77
being 0 390 77
made 0 390 77

best 0 390 77
interest 0 390 77
of 0 390 77
humanity 0 390 77
at 0 390 77
heart, 0 390 77
and 0 390 77
this 0 390 77
is 0 390 77
why 0 390 77
the 0 390 77
system 0 390 77
is 0 390 77
failing 0 390 77
because 0 390 77
it’s 0 390 77

fact 0 390 82
of 0 390 82

The 0 390 87
Takeaway 0 390 87

Recognize 0 390 88
what’s 0 390 88
happening, 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
massive 0 390 88
censorship 0 390 88
of 0 390 88
information, 0 390 88
coupled 0 390 88
with 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
ridicule 0 390 88
or 0 390 88
finger 0 390 88
pointing, 0 390 88
or 0 390 88
even 0 390 88
arrest 0 390 88
of 0 390 88
people 0 390 88
who 0 390 88
choose 0 390 88
to 0 390 88
voice 0 390 88
an 0 390 88
opinion 0 390 88
in 0 390 88
opposition 0 390 88
to 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
rhetoric 0 390 88
that’s 0 390 88
constantly 0 390 88
spewed 1 390 88
by 0 390 88
mainstream 0 390 88
media, 0 390 88
which 0 390 88
in 0 390 88
turn 0 390 88
is 0 390 88
usually 0 390 88
believed 0 390 88
by 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
masses. 0 390 88

At 0 390 89
the 0 390 89
same 0 390 89
time, 0 390 89
independent 0 390 89
media 0 390 89
represents 0 390 89
a 0 390 89
shift 0 390 89
in 0 390 89
consciousness. 0 390 89

A 0 390 90
shift 0 390 90
in 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
perceptions, 0 390 90
thoughts, 0 390 90
feelings 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
general 0 390 90
self-awareness 0 390 90
about 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
own 0 390 90
planet 0 390 90
is 0 390 90
changing, 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
thus, 0 390 90
change 0 390 90
has 0 390 90
been 0 390 90
sprouted 0 390 90
in 0 390 90
multiple 0 390 90
different 0 390 90
areas, 0 390 90
including 0 390 90
political 0 390 90
corruption 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
the 0 390 90
stranglehold 0 390 90
it 0 390 90
has 0 390 90
over 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
world. 0 390 90

We 0 390 91
are 0 390 91
more 0 390 91
aware, 0 390 91
but 0 390 91
there 0 390 91
is 0 390 91
still 0 390 91
some 0 390 91
ways 0 390 91
to 0 390 91
go… 0 390 91

A 0 390 92
good 0 390 92
chunk 0 390 92
of 0 390 92
work 0 390 92
has 0 390 92
been 0 390 92
done. 0 390 92

A 0 390 93
massive 1 390 93
transformation 0 390 93
of 0 390 93
consciousness 0 390 93
has 0 390 93
taken 0 390 93
place 0 390 93
and 0 390 93
it 0 390 93
seems 0 390 93
that 0 390 93
a 0 390 93
global 0 390 93
mass 0 390 93
is 0 390 93
growing 0 390 93
closer 0 390 93
to 0 390 93
a 0 390 93
critical 0 390 93
mass. 0 390 93

The 0 390 94
censorship 0 390 94
of 0 390 94
independent 0 390 94
media 0 390 94
is 0 390 94
irrelevant 0 390 94
in 0 390 94
a 0 390 94
sense, 0 390 94
because 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
shift 0 390 94
will 0 390 94
continue 0 390 94
to 0 390 94
happen, 0 390 94
change 0 390 94
will 1 390 94
continue 1 390 94
to 1 390 94
happen, 1 390 94
and 0 390 94
information 0 390 94
that 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
deep 0 390 94
state 0 390 94
does 0 390 94
not 0 390 94
want 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
public 0 390 94
to 0 390 94
become 0 390 94
aware 0 390 94
of 0 390 94
will 0 390 94
keep 0 390 94
making 0 390 94
its 0 390 94
way 0 390 94
into 0 390 94
transparency. 0 390 94

Independent 0 390 95
media 0 390 95
will 0 390 95
continue 0 390 95
to 0 390 95
have 0 390 95
the 0 390 95
opportunity 0 390 95
to 0 390 95
share 0 390 95
information 0 390 95
because 1 390 95
of 1 390 95
a 1 390 95
lack 1 390 95
of 1 390 95
credible 1 390 95
information 1 390 95
and 1 390 95
plain 1 390 95
truth 1 390 95
within 1 390 95
the 1 390 95

People 0 390 96
are 0 390 96
hungry 0 390 96
for 0 390 96
it, 0 390 96

can 0 391 6
be 0 391 6
released 0 391 6
to 0 391 6
Congress 0 391 6
and 0 391 6
the 0 391 6
public. 0 391 6

The 0 391 7
White 0 391 7
House 0 391 7
and 0 391 7
President 0 391 7
Trump’s 0 391 7
lawyers 0 391 7
said 0 391 7
the 0 391 7
next 0 391 7
decisions 0 391 7
are 0 391 7
up 0 391 7
to 0 391 7
Barr. 0 391 7

There 0 391 8
is 0 391 8
a 0 391 8
possibility 0 391 8
that 0 391 8
Barr 0 391 8
releases 0 391 8
two 0 391 8
separate 0 391 8
reports. 0 391 8

One 0 391 9
would 0 391 9
summarize 0 391 9
Mueller’s 0 391 9
findings 0 391 9
without 0 391 9
including 0 391 9
classified 0 391 9
information 0 391 9
and 0 391 9
would 0 391 9
be 0 391 9
given 0 391 9
to 0 391 9
Congress—and 0 391 9
would 0 391 9
then 0 391 9
most 0 391 9
likely 0 391 9
find 0 391 9
its 0 391 9
way 0 391 9
out 0 391 9
into 0 391 9
the 0 391 9
public. 0 391 9

The 0 391 10
other 0 391 10
would 0 391 10
be 0 391 10
given 0 391 10
to 0 391 10
a 0 391 10
smaller 0 391 10
group 0 391 10
of 0 391 10
lawmakers 0 391 10
who 0 391 10
head 0 391 10
major 0 391 10

such 0 391 10
as 0 391 10

Rep. 0 391 11
Adam 0 391 11
Schiff 0 391 11
(D-CA), 0 391 11
chairman 0 391 11
of 0 391 11
House 0 391 11

called 0 391 11
for 0 391 11
transparency. 0 391 11

“Mueller’s 0 391 12
investigation 0 391 12
began 0 391 12
as 0 391 12
a 0 391 12
counterintelligence 0 391 12
inquiry 0 391 12
into 0 391 12
whether 0 391 12
individuals 0 391 12
associated 0 391 12
with 0 391 12
the 0 391 12
Trump 0 391 12

were 0 391 12
compromised 0 391 12
by 0 391 12
a 0 391 12
foreign 0 391 12
power. 0 391 12

By 0 391 13
law, 0 391 13
that 0 391 13
evidence 0 391 13
he 0 391 13
uncovered 0 391 13
must 0 391 13
be 0 391 13
shared 0 391 13
with 0 391 13
our 0 391 13
Committee,” 0 391 13
he 0 391 13
said 0 391 13
in 0 391 13
a 0 391 13
tweet. 0 391 13

“And 0 391 14
his 0 391 14
report 0 391 14
must 0 391 14
also 0 391 14
be 0 391 14
made 0 391 14
public. 0 391 14

Now.” 1 391 15

Trump 0 391 16
has 0 391 16
previously 0 391 16
said 0 391 16
he 0 391 16
supports 0 391 16
the 0 391 16
idea 0 391 16
of 0 391 16
making 0 391 16
the 0 391 16
report 0 391 16
public. 0 391 16

“I 0 391 17
don’t 0 391 17
mind,” 0 391 17
he 0 391 17
has 0 391 17
said. 0 391 17

“I 0 391 18
mean, 0 391 18
frankly, 0 391 18
I 0 391 18
told 0 391 18
the 0 391 18
House, 0 391 18
‘If 0 391 18
you 0 391 18
want, 0 391 18
let 0 391 18
them 0 391 18
see 0 391 18
it.’” 0 391 18

Trump 0 391 19
has 0 391 19
also 0 391 19
vigorously 0 391 19
denied 0 391 19
any 0 391 19
wrongdoing 0 391 19
and 0 391 19
has 0 391 19
repeatedly 0 391 19
branded 0 391 19
the 0 391 19
probe 0 391 19
as 0 391 19
a 0 391 19
“total 1 391 19
witch 1 391 19
hunt.” 1 391 19

Mueller 0 391 20
will 0 391 20
remain 0 391 20
as 0 391 20
special 0 391 20
counsel 0 391 20
for 0 391 20
a 0 391 20
period 0 391 20
of 0 391 20
time 0 391 20
as 0 391 20
he 0 391 20
and 0 391 20
a 0 391 20
small 0 391 20
contingent 0 391 20
of 0 391 20
staff 0 391 20
close 0 391 20
the 0 391 20
office, 0 391 20
a 0 391 20
Justice 0 391 20
Department 0 391 20
spokesperson 0 391 20
reportedly 0 391 20
said. 0 391 20

The 0 391 21
handover 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
the 0 391 21
report 0 391 21
marks 0 391 21
the 0 391 21
end 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
an 0 391 21
investigation 0 391 21
that 0 391 21
has 0 391 21
for 0 391 21
nearly 0 391 21
two 0 391 21
years 0 391 21
transfixed 1 391 21
the 1 391 21
nation, 1 391 21
yielded 0 391 21
dozens 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
indictments 0 391 21
and 0 391 21
convictions, 0 391 21
and 0 391 21
brought 0 391 21
down 0 391 21
a 0 391 21
handful 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
Trump’s 0 391 21
closest 0 391 21
advisers. 0 391 21

The 0 391 22
Special 0 391 22
Counsel’s 0 391 22
Office 0 391 22
was 0 391 22
tasked 0 391 22
broadly 0 391 22
with 0 391 22
investigating 0 391 22
any 0 391 22
links 0 391 22
or 0 391 22
coordination 0 391 22
between 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
Russian 0 391 22
government 0 391 22
and 0 391 22
individuals 0 391 22
associated 0 391 22
with 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
Trump 0 391 22
campaign, 0 391 22
as 0 391 22
well 0 391 22
as 0 391 22
any 0 391 22
matters 0 391 22
that 0 391 22
arose 0 391 22
directly 0 391 22
from 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
probe. 0 391 22

However, 0 391 23
the 0 391 23
scope 0 391 23
of 0 391 23
the 0 391 23
investigation 0 391 23
seems 0 391 23
to 1 391 23
have 1 391 23
bled 1 391 23
outside 1 391 23
those 1 391 23
lines. 1 391 23

Several 0 391 24
witnesses, 0 391 24
for 0 391 24
example, 0 391 24
have 0 391 24
been 0 391 24
questioned 0 391 24
about 0 391 24
other 0 391 24
countries’ 0 391 24
efforts 0 391 24
to 0 391 24
meddle 0 391 24
in 0 391 24
American 1 391 24
politics, 0 391 24
including 0 391 24
Saudi 0 391 24
Arabia, 0 391 24
Israel, 0 391 24
the 0 391 24
UAE 0 391 24
and 0 391 24
Qatar. 0 391 24

So 0 391 25
far, 0 391 25
the 0 391 25
Special 0 391 25
Counsel’s 0 391 25
Office 0 391 25
has 0 391 25
indicted 0 391 25
or 0 391 25
obtained 0 391 25
guilty 0 391 25
pleas 0 391 25
from 0 391 25
34 0 391 25
people 0 391 25
and 0 391 25
three 0 391 25
companies. 0 391 25

Six 0 391 26
of 0 391 26
those 0 391 26
are 0 391 26
former 0 391 26
Trump 0 391 26
associates, 0 391 26
and 0 391 26
25 0 391 26
of 0 391 26
them 0 391 26
are 0 391 26
Russians. 0 391 26

No 0 391 27
Americans 0 391 27
have 0 391 27
been 0 391 27
charged 0 391 27
with 0 391 27
conspiring 0 391 27
with 0 391 27
Russians 0 391 27
to 0 391 27
meddle 0 391 27
in 0 391 27
the 0 391 27
2016 0 391 27
elections—at 0 391 27
least 0 391 27
none 0 391 27
the 0 391 27
public 0 391 27
knows 0 391 27
about. 0 391 27

But 0 391 28
major 0 391 28
Trumpworld 1 391 28
figures 1 391 28
were 0 391 28
charged 0 391 28
with 0 391 28
a 0 391 28
variety 0 391 28
of 0 391 28
other 0 391 28
crimes, 0 391 28
including 0 391 28
former 0 391 28

Cohen 0 391 29
has 0 391 29
been 0 391 29
sentenced 0 391 29
to 0 391 29
three 0 391 29
years 0 391 29

committed 0 391 29
while 0 391 29
working 0 391 29

with 0 391 29
his 0 391 29

Manafort 0 391 30
was 0 391 30
sentenced 0 391 30
in 0 391 30
both 0 391 30
Virginia 0 391 30
and 0 391 30
in 0 391 30
Washington 0 391 30
and 0 391 30
will 0 391 30
serve 0 391 30
about 0 391 30
seven 0 391 30

In 0 391 31
Washington, 0 391 31
Manafort 0 391 31
was 0 391 31
sentenced 0 391 31
for 0 391 31
for 0 391 31
conspiring 0 391 31
against 0 391 31
the 0 391 31
U.S. 0 391 31
and 0 391 31
a 0 391 31
conspiracy 0 391 31
to 0 391 31
obstruct 0 391 31
justice 0 391 31
connected 0 391 31
to 0 391 31

of 0 391 31

He 0 391 32
was 0 391 32
sentenced 0 391 32
in 0 391 32
Virginia 0 391 32
for 0 391 32
bank 0 391 32

fraud. 0 391 32

The 0 391 33
Special 0 391 33
Counsel’s 0 391 33
Office 0 391 33
said 0 391 33
in 0 391 33
a 0 391 33
court 0 391 33
filing 0 391 33
last 0 391 33
week 0 391 33
that 0 391 33
it 0 391 33
had 0 391 33
gotten 0 391 33
all 0 391 33
it 0 391 33
can 0 391 33
out 0 391 33
of 0 391 33
Flynn, 0 391 33
who 0 391 33
has 0 391 33
been 0 391 33
cooperating 0 391 33
for 0 391 33
months 0 391 33
after 0 391 33
pleading 0 391 33
guilty 0 391 33
in 0 391 33
December 0 391 33
2017 0 391 33

with 0 391 33
Russian 0 391 33
Ambassador 0 391 33

Kislyak. 0 391 33

It’s 0 391 34
unclear 0 391 34
when 0 391 34
he 0 391 34
will 0 391 34
be 0 391 34
sentenced 0 391 34
but 0 391 34
his 0 391 34
lawyers 0 391 34
want 0 391 34
to 0 391 34
wait 0 391 34
until 0 391 34
the 0 391 34
trial 0 391 34

Gates 0 391 35
has 0 391 35
also 0 391 35
been 0 391 35
cooperating 0 391 35
on 0 391 35
a 0 391 35
wide 0 391 35

As 0 391 36
of 0 391 36

Gates 0 391 36

up 0 391 38
pieces 0 391 38
of 0 391 38

very 0 393 18
much 0 393 18
the 0 393 18
beginning, 0 393 18
not 0 393 18

broached 0 393 22
the 0 393 22

in 0 393 22
multiple 0 393 22
conversations 0 393 22

running 0 394 6
through 0 394 6
the 0 394 6

The 0 394 10
three 0 394 10
goals 0 394 10
of 0 394 10
all 0 394 10
this 0 394 10
are 0 394 10
simple. 0 394 10

1. 0 394 11

Keep 0 394 12
the 0 394 12
media 0 394 12
happy 0 394 12
and 0 394 12
profitable 0 394 12

2. 0 394 13

Undermine 1 394 14
President 0 394 14
Trump 0 394 14
and 0 394 14
prevent 0 394 14
him 0 394 14
from 0 394 14
implementing 0 394 14
reforms. 0 394 14

3. 0 394 15

Punish 0 394 16
the 0 394 16
voting 0 394 16
public 0 394 16
for 0 394 16
electing 0 394 16
Trump 0 394 16

Never 0 394 17
underestimate 0 394 17
the 0 394 17
power 0 394 17
of 0 394 17
the 1 394 17
swamp's 1 394 17
spite. 1 394 17

Much 0 394 18
of 0 394 18
this 0 394 18
is 0 394 18
about 0 394 18
self-defense. 0 394 18

The 0 394 19
more 0 394 19
Trump 0 394 19
is 0 394 19
investigated, 0 394 19
the 0 394 19
less 0 394 19
he 0 394 19
can 0 394 19
investigate, 0 394 19
reform 0 394 19
or 0 394 19
implement 0 394 19
changes 0 394 19
to 0 394 19
the 0 394 19
swamp. 1 394 19

But 0 394 20
plenty 0 394 20
of 0 394 20
it 0 394 20
is 0 394 20
about 0 394 20
malice 1 394 20
and 1 394 20
spite. 1 394 20

Culture 0 394 21
wars 0 394 21
are 0 394 21
built 0 394 21
on 0 394 21
tribal 1 394 21
rage. 1 394 21

That's 0 394 21

what 0 394 21

the 0 394 21

"resistance" 0 394 21

has 0 394 21

always 0 394 21

been 0 394 21

about. 0 394 21

of 0 84 3
the 0 84 3
main 0 84 3
events 0 84 3
promoted 0 84 3
beforehand. 0 84 3

However, 0 84 4
his 0 84 4
jokes 0 84 4
quickly 0 84 4
progressed 0 84 4
to 0 84 4
uncomfortable 0 84 4
territory, 0 84 4
including 0 84 4
one 0 84 4
about 0 84 4
a 0 84 4
gay 0 84 4
black 0 84 4
man 0 84 4
who 0 84 4
lives 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
his 0 84 4
neighborhood 0 84 4
and 0 84 4
how 0 84 4
“[I]t 0 84 4
made 0 84 4
me 0 84 4
realize 0 84 4
that 0 84 4

is 0 84 4
definitely 0 84 4
not 0 84 4
a 0 84 4
choice 0 84 4
because 1 84 4
no 1 84 4
one 1 84 4
wants 1 84 4
to 1 84 4
be 1 84 4
gay 1 84 4
and 1 84 4
black.” 1 84 4
The 0 84 4
tension 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
the 0 84 4
room 0 84 4
increased 0 84 4
as 0 84 4
Patel 0 84 4
told 0 84 4
more 0 84 4
jokes 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
this 0 84 4
vein 0 84 4
until 0 84 4
organizers 0 84 4
of 0 84 4
the 0 84 4
event 0 84 4
went 0 84 4
up 0 84 4
on 0 84 4
stage 0 84 4
to 0 84 4
stop 0 84 4
him, 0 84 4
citing 0 84 4
a 0 84 4
change 0 84 4
in 0 84 4
program 0 84 4
plans. 0 84 4

Patel 0 84 5
questioned 0 84 5
why 0 84 5
this 0 84 5
was 0 84 5
happening. 0 84 5

The 0 84 6
organizers 0 84 6
replied 0 84 6
that 0 84 6
the 0 84 6
person 0 84 6
in 0 84 6
charge 0 84 6
of 0 84 6
tech 0 84 6
had 0 84 6
to 0 84 6
leave 0 84 6
early, 0 84 6
but 0 84 6
Patel 0 84 6
continued 0 84 6
to 0 84 6
claim 0 84 6
that 0 84 6
he 0 84 6
was 0 84 6
being 0 84 6
cut 0 84 6
off 0 84 6
because 0 84 6
the 0 84 6
audience 0 84 6
didn’t 0 84 6
like 0 84 6
his 0 84 6
jokes. 0 84 6

At 0 84 7
one 0 84 7
point, 0 84 7
one 0 84 7
organizer 0 84 7
told 0 84 7
Patel 0 84 7
he 0 84 7
was 0 84 7
being 0 84 7
disrespectful. 0 84 7

When 0 84 8
asked 0 84 8
for 0 84 8
closing 0 84 8
remarks, 0 84 8
Patel 0 84 8
responded: 0 84 8
“I’m 1 84 8
a 1 84 8
generation 1 84 8
older 1 84 8
than 1 84 8
all 1 84 8
of 1 84 8
you 1 84 8
I 1 84 8
know 1 84 8
comedy,” 1 84 8
and 0 84 8
called 0 84 8
the 0 84 8
organizers 0 84 8
incorrect 0 84 8
in 0 84 8
ending 0 84 8
his 0 84 8
set. 0 84 8

He 0 84 9
tried 0 84 9
to 0 84 9
continue 0 84 9
speaking 0 84 9
until 0 84 9
his 0 84 9

Biggest 0 402 0

Isn't 0 402 0
"White 0 402 0

“So, 0 402 1
we 0 402 1
have 0 402 1
to 0 402 1

terror 1 402 1
threat 1 402 1
in 1 402 1
this 1 402 1
country 1 402 1
is 1 402 1
white 1 402 1
men, 1 402 1
most 0 402 1
of 0 402 1
them 0 402 1
radicalized 0 402 1
to 0 402 1
the 0 402 1
right. 0 402 1

And 0 402 2
we 0 402 2
have 0 402 2
to 0 402 2
start 0 402 2
doing 0 402 2
something 0 402 2
about 0 402 2
them. 0 402 2

There 0 402 3
is 0 402 3
no 0 402 3
travel 0 402 3
ban 0 402 3
on 0 402 3

There 0 402 4
is 0 402 4
no 0 402 4

on 0 402 4
— 0 402 4
they 0 402 4
had 0 402 4
the 0 402 4

There 0 402 5
is 0 402 5
no 0 402 5

So, 0 402 6
what 0 402 6
do 0 402 6
we 0 402 6
do 0 402 6
about 0 402 6
that?” 0 402 6

Just 0 402 7
to 0 402 7

absurdity 1 402 7
of 0 402 7
Don 0 402 7
Lemon’s 0 402 7
comments, 0 402 7
I 0 402 7
thought 1 402 7
it 1 402 7
would 1 402 7
be 1 402 7
fun 1 402 7
to 0 402 7
go 0 402 7
look 0 402 7
at 0 402 7
the 0 402 7
current 0 402 7
list 0 402 7
of 0 402 7
the 0 402 7
FBI’s 0 402 7
most 0 402 7
wanted 0 402 7
terrorists. 0 402 7

Below 0 402 8
is 0 402 8
the 0 402 8
list 0 402 8
of 0 402 8
“domestic” 0 402 8
terrorists 0 402 8
and, 0 402 8
regardless 0 402 8
of 0 402 8
the 0 402 8
list/filter 0 402 8
you 0 402 8

you 0 402 8
won’t 0 402 8
find 0 402 8
many 0 402 8
“white 1 402 8
men”. 1 402 8

Interestingly 0 402 9
enough, 0 402 9
it 0 402 9
looks 0 402 9
like 0 402 9
the 0 402 9
WOMEN 0 402 9
in 0 402 9
this 0 402 9

do 0 405 23
many 0 405 23

in 0 405 24
less 0 405 24
than 0 405 24
a 0 405 24

Swisher 0 405 25
asked 0 405 25
her, 0 405 25
"What 0 405 25
do 0 405 25
you 0 405 25
think 0 405 25
of 0 405 25
Cory 0 405 25

saying 0 405 25
‘kick 1 405 25
them 1 405 25

essentially?" 0 405 25

Of 0 405 26
course, 0 405 26
Swisher 0 405 26
meant 0 405 26
Eric 0 405 26
Holder 0 405 26

corrected 0 405 26
her, 0 405 26

“Yeah, 0 405 26

alike." 0 405 26

What 1 405 27
was 1 405 27
even 1 405 27
more 1 405 27
amazing 1 405 27
is 0 405 27
that 0 405 27
the 0 405 27
audience 0 405 27
laughed 0 405 27
hysterically. 0 405 27

Can 0 405 28
you 0 405 28
imagine 0 405 28
if 0 405 28
a 0 405 28
conservative 0 405 28
person 0 405 28
uttered 0 405 28
those 0 405 28
comments? 0 405 28

There 0 405 29
would 0 405 29
be 0 405 29
a 0 405 29
near 0 405 29
lynching 0 405 29
of 0 405 29
them 0 405 29
on 0 405 29
the 0 405 29

surely 0 405 29
for 0 405 29
days 0 405 29
to 0 405 29
come. 0 405 29

They 0 405 30
might 0 405 30
lose 0 405 30
their 0 405 30
livelihood 0 405 30
and 0 405 30

threats, 0 405 30
but 0 405 30
not 0 405 30
"Crooked" 1 405 30
Hillary. 1 405 30

Clearly, 1 405 31
she 1 405 31
was 1 405 31
speaking 1 405 31
of 1 405 31
all 1 405 31

I 0 275 15
completely 0 275 15

In 0 275 16
fact, 0 275 16
I've 0 275 16
often 0 275 16
said 0 275 16
if 0 275 16
we 0 275 16
catch 0 275 16
people 0 275 16
close 0 275 16
to 0 275 16
the 0 275 16
border, 0 275 16
we 0 275 16
should 0 275 16
not 0 275 16
even 0 275 16
bring 0 275 16
them 0 275 16
into 0 275 16
the 0 275 16
system 0 275 16
if 0 275 16
they 0 275 16
are 0 275 16
not 0 275 16
citizens, 0 275 16
but 0 275 16
walk 0 275 16
them 0 275 16
back 0 275 16
over 0 275 16
the 0 275 16
border 0 275 16
and 0 275 16
make 0 275 16
sure 0 275 16
they 0 275 16
keep 0 275 16
walking. 0 275 16

Often, 0 275 17
by 0 275 17
putting 0 275 17
illegals 0 275 17
into 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
system, 0 275 17
it 0 275 17
takes 0 275 17
years 0 275 17
to 0 275 17
deport 0 275 17
them, 0 275 17
which 0 275 17
costs 0 275 17
the 0 275 17
American 1 275 17
people 1 275 17
lots 0 275 17
of 0 275 17
money. 0 275 17

That 0 275 18
system 0 275 18
would 0 275 18
require 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
judges 0 275 18
to 0 275 18
handle 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
illegals 0 275 18
and 0 275 18
Trump 0 275 18
ripped 0 275 18
the 0 275 18
calls 0 275 18
for 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
judges 0 275 18
in 0 275 18
favor 0 275 18
of 0 275 18
a 0 275 18
more 0 275 18
"simple 0 275 18
immigration 0 275 18
plan." 0 275 18

“We 0 275 19
want 0 275 19
strong 0 275 19
borders 0 275 19
and 0 275 19
we 0 275 19
want 0 275 19
no 0 275 19
crime,” 0 275 19
Trump 0 275 19
said. 0 275 19

“The 1 275 20
Democrats 1 275 20
want 1 275 20
open 1 275 20
borders 1 275 20
and 1 275 20
they 1 275 20
don’t 1 275 20
care 1 275 20
about 1 275 20
crime.” 1 275 20

Trump 0 275 21
then 0 275 21
called 0 275 21
on 0 275 21
Congress 0 275 21
to 0 275 21
correct 0 275 21
the 0 275 21
problems 0 275 21
created 0 275 21
by 0 275 21
legislation 0 275 21
with 0 275 21
more 0 275 21
legislation. 0 275 21

“The 0 275 22
laws 0 275 22
are 0 275 22
obsolete, 0 275 22
the 0 275 22
laws 0 275 22
are 0 275 22
horrible, 1 275 22
having 0 275 22
to 0 275 22
do 0 275 22
with 0 275 22
the 0 275 22
border, 0 275 22
both 0 275 22
in 0 275 22
terms 0 275 22
of 0 275 22
security 0 275 22
and 0 275 22
in 0 275 22
terms 0 275 22
of 0 275 22
taking 0 275 22
care 0 275 22
of 0 275 22
people,” 0 275 22
he 0 275 22
said. 0 275 22

“We 1 275 23
want 1 275 23
children 1 275 23
staying 1 275 23
together,” 1 275 23
Trump 0 275 23
said, 0 275 23
blasting 0 275 23
the 0 275 23
New 0 275 23
York 0 275 23
Times 0 275 23
report 0 275 23
that 0 275 23
said 0 275 23
he 0 275 23
didn't 0 275 23
really 0 275 23
want 0 275 23
to 0 275 23
sign 0 275 23
his 0 275 23
executive 0 275 23
order 0 275 23
last 0 275 23
week 0 275 23
that 0 275 23
would 0 275 23
keep 0 275 23
families 0 275 23
together 0 275 23
in 0 275 23
detention 0 275 23
while 0 275 23
they 0 275 23
awaited 0 275 23
the 0 275 23
judicial 0 275 23
process. 0 275 23

Of 0 275 24
course, 0 275 24
Trump 0 275 24
has 0 275 24
inherited 0 275 24
a 0 275 24
problem 0 275 24
that 0 275 24
has 0 275 24
existed 0 275 24
for 0 275 24
several 0 275 24
administrations, 0 275 24
both 0 275 24
Republican 0 275 24
and 0 275 24
Democrat, 0 275 24
for 0 275 24
decades. 0 275 24

It 0 275 25
is 0 275 25
time 0 275 25
that 0 275 25
Congress 0 275 25
sure 0 275 25
up 0 275 25
things 0 275 25
so 0 275 25
that 0 275 25
America's 1 275 25
tax 1 275 25
dollars 1 275 25
are 0 275 25
not 0 275 25
bound 0 275 25
up 0 275 25
in 0 275 25
a 0 275 25
worthless 1 275 25
judicial 0 275 25
process 0 275 25
when 0 275 25
people 0 275 25
are 0 275 25
clearly 0 275 25
in 0 275 25
the 0 275 25
country 0 275 25
illegally. 0 275 25

Sadly, 0 275 26
too 0 275 26
many 0 275 26
people 0 275 26
want 0 275 26
more 0 275 26
amnesty 0 275 26
which 0 275 26
begs 0 275 26
the 0 275 26
question 0 275 26
if 0 275 26
any 0 275 26
of 0 275 26

members 0 279 41
of 0 279 41
the 0 279 41

wherever 0 279 41
they 0 279 41
happened 0 279 41
to 0 279 41
find 0 279 41
them. 0 279 41

Leftists 0 279 42
have 0 279 42
said 0 279 42
the 0 279 42
connection 0 279 42
is 0 279 42
unfair, 0 279 42
because 0 279 42
Waters’ 0 279 42
was 0 279 42
only 0 279 42
calling 0 279 42
for 0 279 42
accosting 0 279 42
Trump 0 279 42
administration 0 279 42
officials. 0 279 42

My 0 279 43
question 0 279 43
is; 0 279 43
how 0 279 43
big 0 279 43
of 0 279 43
a 0 279 43
leap 0 279 43
would 0 279 43
it 0 279 43
be 0 279 43
for 0 279 43
a 0 279 43
normal, 0 279 43
rational 0 279 43
adult 0 279 43
to 0 279 43
go 0 279 43
from 0 279 43
confronting 0 279 43
administration 0 279 43
officials 0 279 43
to 0 279 43
attacking 0 279 43
the 0 279 43
people 0 279 43
who 0 279 43
elected 0 279 43
them 0 279 43
to 0 279 43
power? 0 279 43

Not 0 279 44
much 0 279 44
in 0 279 44
my 0 279 44
mind. 0 279 44

The 0 279 45
reality 0 279 45
is 0 279 45
that 0 279 45
the 0 279 45
Democrats 0 279 45
are 0 279 45
as 0 279 45
much 0 279 45
to 0 279 45
blame 0 279 45
for 0 279 45
the 0 279 45
corrosive 1 279 45
and 0 279 45
ugly 1 279 45

I 0 280 18
laughingly 0 280 18
replied. 0 280 18

I 0 280 19
said, 0 280 19
"Mom, 0 280 19
when 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
in 0 280 19
the 1 280 19

that 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
doing, 0 280 19
nobody 0 280 19
said 0 280 19
anything, 0 280 19
and 0 280 19
no 0 280 19
one 0 280 19
had 0 280 19
a 0 280 19
problem 0 280 19
with 0 280 19
what 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
doing, 0 280 19
that 0 280 19
is 0 280 19
until 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
started 0 280 19
to 0 280 19
emulate 0 280 19
(obey) 0 280 19
Jesus 0 280 19
Christ" 0 280 19
(1 0 280 19
John 0 280 19
2:6). 0 280 19

This 0 280 20
reminds 0 280 20
me 0 280 20
of 0 280 20
when 0 280 20
I 0 280 20
gave 0 280 20
a 0 280 20
prayer 0 280 20
at 0 280 20
the 0 280 20
state 0 280 20
capital 0 280 20
in 0 280 20
Minnesota. 0 280 20

After 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
prayer 0 280 21
was 0 280 21
over, 0 280 21
I 0 280 21
had 0 280 21
a 0 280 21
minister 0 280 21
come 0 280 21
up 0 280 21
to 0 280 21
me 0 280 21
and 0 280 21
tell 0 280 21
me 0 280 21
that 0 280 21
I 0 280 21
could 0 280 21
not 0 280 21
be 0 280 21
dropping 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
“J” 0 280 21
(Jesus) 0 280 21
word 0 280 21
in 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
capital. 0 280 21

I 0 280 22
said 0 280 22
that 0 280 22
the 1 280 22
reason 1 280 22
I 1 280 22
dropped 1 280 22
the 1 280 22
“J” 1 280 22
word 1 280 22
was 1 280 22
because 1 280 22
you 1 280 22
haven’t 1 280 22
in 1 280 22
40 1 280 22
years 1 280 22
(Romans 0 280 22
1:16). 0 280 22

What 0 280 23
of 0 280 23
public 0 280 23
high 0 280 23
schools 0 280 23
across 0 280 23
the 0 280 23
country 0 280 23
that 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
have 0 280 23
been 0 280 23
going 0 280 23
into 0 280 23
in 0 280 23

to 0 280 23
who 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
are, 0 280 23
and 0 280 23
not 0 280 23
what 0 280 23
the 1 280 23
revisionists 1 280 23
and 1 280 23
propagandists 1 280 23
would 0 280 23
have 0 280 23
them 0 280 23
believe 0 280 23
that 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
are. 0 280 23

We 0 280 24
have 0 280 24
shown 0 280 24
the 0 280 24
young 0 280 24
people 0 280 24
that 0 280 24
abortion 1 280 24
is 1 280 24
murder 1 280 24
and 1 280 24
that 1 280 24
58 1 280 24
million 1 280 24
babies 1 280 24
have 1 280 24
been 1 280 24
murdered 1 280 24
since 1 280 24
1973 1 280 24
under 1 280 24
the 1 280 24
guise 1 280 24
of 1 280 24
woman’s 1 280 24
choice 1 280 24
(Proverbs 0 280 24
6:17). 0 280 24

We 1 280 25
got 1 280 25
kicked 1 280 25
out 1 280 25
of 1 280 25
a 1 280 25
public 1 280 25
school 1 280 25
for 1 280 25
re-enforcing 1 280 25
America’s 1 280 25
value’s 1 280 25
by 1 280 25
teaching 1 280 25
the 1 280 25
US 1 280 25
Constitution. 1 280 25

We 0 280 26
have 0 280 26
taught 0 280 26
that 0 280 26
homosexuality 1 280 26
is 1 280 26
an 1 280 26
abomination, 1 280 26
and 0 280 26
how 0 280 26
it 0 280 26
is 0 280 26
a 0 280 26
felony 0 280 26
in 0 280 26
every 0 280 26
state 0 280 26
in 0 280 26
our 0 280 26
union 0 280 26
(Leviticus 0 280 26
18:22; 0 280 26
20:13; 0 280 26
Jude 0 280 26
1:7). 0 280 26

How 0 280 27
true 0 280 27
Scripture 0 280 27
is 0 280 27
when 0 280 27
it 0 280 27
declares: 0 280 27

“Woe 0 280 28
unto 0 280 28
them 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
call 0 280 28
evil 0 280 28
good, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
good 0 280 28
evil; 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
put 0 280 28
darkness 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
light, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
light 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
darkness; 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
put 0 280 28
bitter 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
sweet, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
sweet 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
bitter!" 0 280 28

No 0 280 29
wonder 0 280 29
why 0 280 29
the 1 280 29
reprobates 1 280 29
and 1 280 29
hypocrites 1 280 29
thought 0 280 29
that 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
Christians 0 280 29
who 0 280 29
were 0 280 29
following 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
living 0 280 29
Christ 0 280 29
were 0 280 29
turning 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
world 0 280 29
upside 0 280 29
down 0 280 29
in 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
book 0 280 29
of 0 280 29
Acts. 0 280 29

They 0 280 30
were, 0 280 30
in 0 280 30
fact, 0 280 30
turning 0 280 30
the 0 280 30
world 0 280 30
right 0 280 30
side 0 280 30
up 0 280 30
(Acts 0 280 30
17:6). 0 280 30

Identifying 0 280 31
the 0 280 31
genuine 0 280 31
from 0 280 31
the 0 280 31
counterfeit 0 280 31

Last 0 280 32
week, 0 280 32
I 0 280 32
had 0 280 32
a 0 280 32
woman 0 280 32
come 0 280 32
up 0 280 32
to 0 280 32
me 0 280 32
at 0 280 32
my 0 280 32
last 0 280 32
meeting 0 280 32
in 0 280 32
Amery, 0 280 32
Wisconsin. 0 280 32

She 0 280 33
said 0 280 33
that 0 280 33
she 0 280 33
did 0 280 33
her 0 280 33
research 0 280 33
on 0 280 33
me 0 280 33
and 0 280 33
said 0 280 33
that 0 280 33
the 0 280 33
media 0 280 33
really 0 280 33
attacked 0 280 33
me. 0 280 33

I 0 280 34
responded 0 280 34
with, 0 280 34
"Of 1 280 34
course 1 280 34
they 1 280 34
did, 1 280 34
and 1 280 34
of 1 280 34
course 1 280 34
they 1 280 34
still 1 280 34
do." 1 280 34

They 1 280 35
are 1 280 35
being 1 280 35
exposed 1 280 35
for 1 280 35
who 1 280 35
they 1 280 35
are 1 280 35
and 1 280 35
they 1 280 35
do 1 280 35
not 1 280 35
like 1 280 35
it. 1 280 35

(John 0 280 36
15:22). 0 280 36

I 0 280 37
told 0 280 37
her 0 280 37
that 0 280 37
there 0 280 37
are 0 280 37
too 0 280 37
many 0 280 37
counterfeits, 1 280 37
self-proclaimed 1 280 37
leaders, 1 280 37
out 0 280 37
there 0 280 37
who 1 280 37
care 1 280 37
more 1 280 37
about 1 280 37
saving 1 280 37
face, 1 280 37
than 1 280 37
they 1 280 37
do 1 280 37
the 1 280 37
souls 1 280 37
of 1 280 37
men 1 280 37
(Luke 1 280 37
19:10), 1 280 37
as 1 280 37
well 1 280 37
as 1 280 37
saving 1 280 37
their 1 280 37
country. 1 280 37

Apparently 0 280 38
they 0 280 38
have 0 280 38
a 0 280 38
reputation 0 280 38
to 0 280 38
keep 0 280 38
up. 0 280 38

Philippians 0 280 39
2:7-9 0 280 39

These 0 280 40
are 0 280 40
those 0 280 40
that 0 280 40
sit 0 280 40
behind 0 280 40
the 0 280 40
status 0 280 40
of 0 280 40
some 0 280 40
sort 0 280 40
of 0 280 40
church 0 280 40
or 0 280 40
political 1 280 40
leader 1 280 40
of 1 280 40
the 1 280 40
pack. 1 280 40

Yet, 1 280 41
you 1 280 41
do 1 280 41
not 1 280 41
see 1 280 41
any 1 280 41
warfare 1 280 41
or 1 280 41
opposition 1 280 41
around 1 280 41
them 1 280 41
and 1 280 41
why? 1 280 41

because 1 280 42
they 1 280 42
have 1 280 42
simply 1 280 42
forsaken 1 280 42
the 1 280 42
cross. 1 280 42

There 0 280 43
is 0 280 43
no 0 280 43
absolutes 0 280 43
with 0 280 43
these 0 280 43
people. 0 280 43

They 1 280 44
are 1 280 44
people 1 280 44
pleasers 1 280 44
and 1 280 44
nothing 1 280 44
more. 1 280 44

After 0 280 45
all 0 280 45
you 0 280 45
can 0 280 45
always 0 280 45
tell 0 280 45
what 0 280 45
a 0 280 45
man 0 280 45
stands 0 280 45
for 0 280 45
by 0 280 45
the 0 280 45
enemies 0 280 45
that 0 280 45
he 0 280 45
has. 0 280 45

They 0 280 46
hide 1 280 46
behind 1 280 46
a 1 280 46
microphone 1 280 46
day 0 280 46
after 0 280 46
day. 0 280 46

Yet, 0 280 47
they 0 280 47
fail 0 280 47
to 0 280 47
confront 0 280 47
the 0 280 47
issues 0 280 47
that 0 280 47
needed 0 280 47
to 0 280 47
be 0 280 47
confronted. 0 280 47

The 1 280 48
reason 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
don't 1 280 48
is 1 280 48
because 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
are 1 280 48
guilty 1 280 48
of 1 280 48
what 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
fail 1 280 48
to 1 280 48

these 1 280 54

Maybe 0 280 55
this 0 280 55

These 1 280 56
groups 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
people 1 280 56
are 1 280 56
simply 1 280 56

that 0 280 57
this 0 280 57

and 0 280 57
those 1 280 57
who 1 280 57
are 1 280 57
counterfeits. 1 280 57

When 0 280 58
the 0 280 58
church 0 280 58
and 0 280 58
the 0 280 58
world 0 280 58

you 0 280 58
can 0 280 58
be 0 280 58
sure 0 280 58
something 0 280 58
is 0 280 58
wrong. 0 280 58

The 0 280 59

not 0 280 59
compromised—its 0 280 59

same 0 280 59

it 0 280 59
ever 0 280 59
was. 0 280 59

If 1 280 60
Christians 1 280 60

equally 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
faithful 1 280 60

so 1 280 60
that 1 280 60
their 1 280 60

Nuclear 1 76 16

Why 0 76 17
are 0 76 17
we 0 76 17
even 0 76 17

in 0 76 17
North 0 76 17
Asia? 0 76 17

Because 0 76 18
North 0 76 18
Korea 0 76 18
has 0 76 18
scraped 1 76 18
and 1 76 18

the 0 76 18
sole 0 76 18

of 0 76 18
deterring 0 76 18
a 0 76 18
major 0 76 18

including 0 76 18
the 0 76 18

Pakistan 0 76 19

decades 1 76 19
to 0 76 19

far 0 76 19
more 0 76 19
powerful 0 76 19
India. 0 76 19

Israel 0 76 20
uses 0 76 20
the 0 76 20
same 0 76 20

to 0 76 20
justify 0 76 20
its 0 76 20

After 0 76 21
Washington 0 76 21
overthrew 0 76 21
the 0 76 21

of 0 76 21

Libya, 0 76 21
it 0 76 21
became 0 76 21
painfully 1 76 21
apparent 1 76 21
that 0 76 21
small 0 76 21
nations 0 76 21
without 0 76 21
nuclear 0 76 21

to 0 76 21
US 0 76 21
‘regime 0 76 21

The 0 76 22
North 0 76 22
Koreans, 0 76 22
who 0 76 22
are 0 76 22
very 1 76 22
eccentric 1 76 22
but 1 76 22
not 1 76 22
stupid, 1 76 22
rushed 0 76 22
to 0 76 22
accelerate 0 76 22
their 0 76 22
nuclear 0 76 22
weapons 0 76 22
and 0 76 22
delivery 0 76 22
systems. 0 76 22

Almost 0 76 23
equally 0 76 23
important, 0 76 23
North 0 76 23
Korea 0 76 23
boasts 0 76 23
one 0 76 23

The 0 76 24
North’s 0 76 24

obsolescent; 0 76 24

the 0 76 24

War 1 76 25
against 1 76 25
North 1 76 25
Korea 1 76 25
would 1 76 25
be 1 76 25
a 1 76 25
slow 1 76 25

bloody 1 76 25

First, 0 281 16
the 0 281 16
hubristic 0 281 16
drive, 0 281 16
despite 0 281 16
the 0 281 16

of 0 281 16
statesmen 0 281 16
like 0 281 16
George 0 281 16

to 0 281 16
exploit 0 281 16
our 0 281 16
Cold 0 281 16
War 0 281 16
victory 0 281 16
and 0 281 16
pursue 0 281 16
a 0 281 16
policy 0 281 16
of 0 281 16
permanent 0 281 16
containment 0 281 16
of 0 281 16
a 0 281 16
Russia 0 281 16
that 0 281 16
had 0 281 16
lost 0 281 16
a 0 281 16
third 0 281 16

territory 0 281 16
and 0 281 16
half 0 281 16
its 0 281 16
people. 0 281 16

We 0 281 17
moved 0 281 17

into 0 281 17
Eastern 0 281 17
Europe 0 281 17

the 0 281 17

onto 0 281 17
her 0 281 17
doorstep. 0 281 17

We 0 281 18
abrogated 0 281 18
the 0 281 18
ABM 0 281 18
treaty 0 281 18
Nixon 0 281 18

John 0 281 19

Georgia 0 281 19

seem 0 281 20
content 0 281 20
to 0 281 20

The 0 283 3
Pope 0 283 3

the 0 283 3
Middle 0 283 3

And 0 283 3
he 1 283 3

The 0 283 4
Middle 0 283 4
East 0 283 4
has 0 283 4
become 0 283 4
a 0 283 4

behind.” 0 283 4
He 0 283 4
cried: 0 283 4
“Indifference 1 283 4
kills, 1 283 4

the 1 283 5

Well, 0 288 26
it 0 288 26
took 0 288 26

thank 0 288 26
you 0 288 26

And 0 288 28
for 0 288 28
all 0 288 28
those 0 288 28
who 0 288 28
took 0 288 28
the 0 288 28
time 0 288 28
to 0 288 28
keep 0 288 28
this 0 288 28
story 0 288 28

urge 0 288 28
people 0 288 28
to 0 288 28
petition 0 288 28

thank 0 288 28
you! 0 288 28

It 0 288 29
should 0 288 29
be 0 288 29
noted 0 288 29
that 0 288 29
the 0 288 29
protests 0 288 29
that 0 288 29
took 0 288 29
place 0 288 29
in 0 288 29
Oregon 0 288 29
a 0 288 29
couple 0 288 29
of 0 288 29
years 0 288 29
ago 0 288 29
were 0 288 29
a 0 288 29
response 0 288 29
to 0 288 29
the 0 288 29
injustice 1 288 29
the 0 288 29
Hammonds 0 288 29
faced. 0 288 29

As 0 288 30
a 0 288 30
result, 0 288 30
Robert 0 288 30
"LaVoy" 0 288 30
Finicum 0 288 30
was 0 288 30
killed 0 288 30
by 0 288 30
Oregon 0 288 30
State 0 288 30
Police. 0 288 30

Those 0 288 31
who 0 288 31
led 0 288 31
the 0 288 31
protest 0 288 31
were 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
acquitted 0 288 31
of 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
charges 0 288 31
and 0 288 31
reporter 0 288 31
Pete 0 288 31
Santilli 0 288 31
had 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
of 0 288 31
his 0 288 31
charges 0 288 31
dismissed. 0 288 31

No 0 288 32
doubt, 0 288 32
Finicum 0 288 32
would 0 288 32
have 0 288 32
been 0 288 32
found 0 288 32
not 0 288 32
guilty 0 288 32
as 0 288 32
well, 0 288 32
but 0 288 32
that's 0 288 32
not 0 288 32
how 0 288 32
tyrants 1 288 32
work, 0 288 32
is 0 288 32
it? 0 288 32

Today 0 288 33
is 0 288 33
a 0 288 33
day 0 288 33
to 0 288 33
celebrate 0 288 33
a 0 288 33

has 0 288 33
not 0 288 33
been 0 288 33
fully 0 288 33
made 0 288 33
right, 0 288 33
but 0 288 33
has 0 288 33
definitely 0 288 33

one 0 290 9
of 0 290 9
the 0 290 9

And, 0 290 12
predictably, 0 290 12
the 0 290 12

In 0 290 15
January, 0 290 15
Traore 0 290 15
was 0 290 15
determined 0 290 15
to 0 290 15
be 0 290 15
fit 0 290 15
to 0 290 15
stand 0 290 15
trial. 0 290 15

He 0 290 16
was 0 290 16
placed 0 290 16

no 0 290 16
history 0 290 16

But 0 290 17
a 0 290 17
judge 0 290 17
requested 0 290 17
a 0 290 17
second 0 290 17
series 0 290 17
of 0 290 17
tests, 0 290 17
which 0 290 17
determined 0 290 17
that 0 290 17
the 0 290 17
Malian 0 290 17
immigrant 0 290 17
was 0 290 17
not 0 290 17

Minutes 0 290 17
reported 0 290 17
Wednesday. 0 290 17

This 0 290 18
tired 1 290 18
farce 1 290 18
has 0 290 18
dragged 0 290 18
on. 0 290 18

Kobili 0 290 19
Traore 0 290 19
was 0 290 19
hit 1 290 19
with 0 290 19
hate 0 290 19
crimes 0 290 19
charges. 0 290 19

Then 0 290 20
they 0 290 20
were 0 290 20
dropped. 0 290 20

The 1 290 21
authorities 1 290 21
allowed 1 290 21
him 1 290 21
to 1 290 21
commit 1 290 21
the 1 290 21
crime. 1 290 21

Now 0 290 22
they're 0 290 22
letting 0 290 22
him 0 290 22
get 0 290 22
away 0 290 22
with 0 290 22
it. 0 290 22

Three 0 290 23
minutes 0 290 23
later, 0 290 23
a 0 290 23
unit 0 290 23
of 0 290 23
the 0 290 23
Anti-Crime 0 290 23
Brigade 0 290 23

who 0 290 23
happened 0 290 23
to 0 290 23
be 0 290 23
patrolling 0 290 23
the 0 290 23
area 0 290 23
— 0 290 23
took 0 290 23
up 0 290 23
position 0 290 23
in 0 290 23
front 0 290 23
of 0 290 23
Diara’s 0 290 23
door. 0 290 23

They 0 290 24
heard 0 290 24
Kobili 0 290 24
Traore 0 290 24
chanting 0 290 24
Muslim 0 290 24
prayers 0 290 24
and 0 290 24
Koranic 0 290 24
verses. 0 290 24

Unsure 0 290 25
about 0 290 25
the 0 290 25
situation 0 290 25
and 0 290 25
the 0 290 25
potential 0 290 25
threats 0 290 25
to 0 290 25
the 0 290 25
family, 0 290 25
they 0 290 25
asked 0 290 25
for 0 290 25
reinforcements. 0 290 25

Additional 0 290 26
policemen 0 290 26
arrived 0 290 26
quickly. 0 290 26

However, 0 290 27
for 0 290 27
some 0 290 27
unclear 0 290 27
reason, 0 290 27
the 0 290 27
BAC 0 290 27
unit 0 290 27
still 0 290 27
refrained 0 290 27
from 0 290 27
breaking 0 290 27
in. 0 290 27

In 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
meantime, 0 290 28
Kobili 0 290 28
Traore 0 290 28
put 0 290 28
on 0 290 28
new 0 290 28
clothes 0 290 28
and 0 290 28
climbed 0 290 28
out 0 290 28
of 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
window 0 290 28
to 0 290 28
reach 0 290 28
Sarah 0 290 28
Halimi’s 0 290 28
apartment, 0 290 28
which 0 290 28
was 0 290 28
at 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
same 0 290 28
level 0 290 28
as 0 290 28
Diara 0 290 28
Traore’s. 0 290 28

He 0 290 29
allegedly 0 290 29
assaulted 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
Jewish 0 290 29
woman 0 290 29
and 0 290 29
hit 1 290 29
her 1 290 29

resumed 0 290 30
Koranic 0 290 30

Many 0 290 31

by 0 290 31
the 0 290 31

or 0 290 31
the 0 290 31

the 0 290 31
police 0 290 31

gave 0 290 31
details 0 290 31
about 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
exact 0 290 31
location 0 290 31
of 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
assault, 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
attacker’s 0 290 31
identity, 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
fact 0 290 31
he 0 290 31
vilified 0 290 31
his 0 290 31
victim 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
a 0 290 31
Jewish 0 290 31
person 0 290 31
and 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
“a 1 290 31
Satan” 1 290 31
while 0 290 31
hitting 0 290 31
her, 0 290 31
or 0 290 31
even 0 290 31
— 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
far 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
Muslim 0 290 31
neighbours 0 290 31
were 0 290 31
concerned 0 290 31
— 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
Koranic 0 290 31
portions 0 290 31
he 0 290 31
chanted. 0 290 31

Yet 0 290 32
the 0 290 32
police 0 290 32
still 0 290 32
failed 0 290 32
to 0 290 32
storm 0 290 32
Sarah 0 290 32
Halimi’s 0 290 32
apartment 0 290 32
and 0 290 32
rescue 0 290 32
her. 0 290 32

Eventually, 0 290 33
Kobili 0 290 33
Traore 0 290 33
is 0 290 33
claimed 0 290 33
to 0 290 33
have 0 290 33
shouted 0 290 33
that 0 290 33
the 0 290 33
woman 0 290 33
was 0 290 33
“mad 0 290 33
and 0 290 33
about 0 290 33
to 0 290 33
commit 0 290 33
suicide”, 0 290 33
and 0 290 33
threw 0 290 33
her 0 290 33
out 0 290 33
of 0 290 33
the 0 290 33
window. 0 290 33

He 0 290 34
had 0 290 34
time 0 290 34
enough 0 290 34
to 0 290 34
climb 0 290 34
back 0 290 34
to 0 290 34
Diara 0 290 34
Traore’s 0 290 34
apartment 0 290 34
where 0 290 34
he 0 290 34
finally 0 290 34
was 0 290 34
arrested. 0 290 34

His 0 290 35
hands 0 290 35
were 0 290 35
covered 0 290 35
in 0 290 35
blood. 0 290 35

There 0 290 36
was 0 290 36
blood 0 290 36
everywhere 0 290 36
in 0 290 36
his 0 290 36
victim’s 0 290 36
apartment. 0 290 36

Sure 0 290 37
he 0 290 37
was 0 290 37
crazy. 1 290 37

So 0 290 38
crazy 0 290 38
he 0 290 38
tried 0 290 38
to 0 290 38
contrive 0 290 38
an 0 290 38
alibi 0 290 38
for 0 290 38
his 0 290 38
crime. 0 290 38

Kobili 0 290 39
isn't 0 290 39
crazy. 1 290 39

But 0 290 39

the 0 290 39

system 0 290 39

that 0 290 39

keeps 0 290 39

on 0 290 39

and 1 292 1
naive 1 292 1
do-gooder 1 292 1
alike. 0 292 1

The 1 292 2
latter 1 292 2
think 1 292 2
that 1 292 2
removing 1 292 2
guns 1 292 2
will 1 292 2
suddenly 1 292 2
force 1 292 2

stop 1 292 2
all 1 292 2

toward 1 292 2
one 1 292 2
another, 1 292 2
hold 1 292 2

and 1 292 2
sing 1 292 2
Kumbaya. 1 292 2

The 1 292 3
former 1 292 3
recognizes 1 292 3
that 1 292 3
an 1 292 3
armed 1 292 3
populace 1 292 3
is 1 292 3
a 1 292 3
threat 1 292 3
to 1 292 3
any 1 292 3
tyrant 1 292 3
and 1 292 3
pushes 1 292 3
for 1 292 3
gun 1 292 3
control 1 292 3
out 1 292 3
of 1 292 3

who 0 294 46
later 0 294 46
in 0 294 46
the 0 294 46

a 0 294 46
supply-side 0 294 46
policy, 0 294 46
were, 0 294 46
at 0 294 46
this 0 294 46
time, 0 294 46
opposed 0 294 46
(see 0 294 46

The 0 294 47
Democrats 0 294 47
claimed 0 294 47
that 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
policy 0 294 47
would 0 294 47
worsen 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
budget 0 294 47
deficit, 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
only 0 294 47
time 0 294 47
in 0 294 47
those 0 294 47
days 0 294 47
Democrats 0 294 47
cared 0 294 47
about 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
budget 0 294 47
deficit. 0 294 47

The 0 294 48
Democrats 0 294 48
said 0 294 48
that 0 294 48
they 0 294 48
would 0 294 48
support 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
tax 0 294 48
rate 0 294 48
reductions 0 294 48
if 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
Republicans 0 294 48
would 0 294 48
support 0 294 48
offsetting 0 294 48
cuts 0 294 48
in 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
budget 0 294 48
to 0 294 48
support 0 294 48
a 0 294 48
balanced 0 294 48
budget. 0 294 48

This 0 294 49
was 0 294 49
a 0 294 49
ploy 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
put 0 294 49
Republicans 0 294 49
on 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
spot 0 294 49
for 0 294 49
taking 0 294 49
away 0 294 49
some 0 294 49
groups’ 0 294 49
handouts 0 294 49
in 0 294 49
order 0 294 49
“to 0 294 49

the 0 294 49
rich.” 0 294 49

The 0 294 50
supply-side 0 294 50
policy 0 294 50
did 0 294 50
not 0 294 50
require 0 294 50
budget 0 294 50
cuts, 0 294 50
but 0 294 50
in 0 294 50
order 0 294 50
to 0 294 50
demonstrate 0 294 50
the 0 294 50

of 0 294 50
sincerety, 0 294 50
Hayakawa’s 0 294 50
aid 0 294 50
and 0 294 50
I 0 294 50
had 0 294 50
our 0 294 50
senators 0 294 50
introduce 0 294 50
a 0 294 50

the 0 294 50
Democrats 0 294 50
voted 0 294 50
against 0 294 50
them 0 294 50
every 0 294 50
time. 0 294 50

When 0 294 51
the 0 294 51
combination 0 294 51
of 0 294 51
tax 0 294 51
cuts 0 294 51
with 0 294 51
defense 0 294 51
budget 0 294 51
cuts 0 294 51
came 0 294 51
up 0 294 51
for 0 294 51
a 0 294 51
vote, 0 294 51
the 1 294 51
legendary 1 294 51
senator 1 294 51
Strom 0 294 51
Thurmond, 0 294 51
a 0 294 51
48-year 0 294 51
member 0 294 51
of 0 294 51
the 0 294 51
US 0 294 51
Senate 0 294 51
from 0 294 51
South 0 294 51
Carolina, 0 294 51
tapped 0 294 51
me 0 294 51
on 0 294 51
the 0 294 51
shoulder. 0 294 51

He 0 294 52
said: 0 294 52
“son, 1 294 52
never 1 294 52
set 1 294 52
your 1 294 52
senator 1 294 52
up 1 294 52
against 1 294 52
the 1 294 52
military/security 1 294 52
complex. 1 294 52

He 1 294 53
will 1 294 53
not 1 294 53
be 1 294 53
re-elected, 1 294 53
and 1 294 53
you 1 294 53
will 1 294 53
be 1 294 53
out 1 294 53
of 1 294 53
a 1 294 53
job.” 1 294 53
I 0 294 53
replied 0 294 53
that 0 294 53
we 0 294 53
were 0 294 53
just 0 294 53
establishing 0 294 53
for 0 294 53
the 0 294 53
record 0 294 53
that 0 294 53
under 0 294 53
no 0 294 53
conditions 0 294 53
would 0 294 53
the 0 294 53
Democrats, 0 294 53
who 0 294 53
wanted 0 294 53
more 0 294 53
government, 0 294 53
vote 0 294 53
for 0 294 53
a 0 294 53
tax 0 294 53
rate 0 294 53
reduction 0 294 53
even 0 294 53
if 0 294 53
there 0 294 53
was 0 294 53
a 0 294 53
case 0 294 53
that 0 294 53
it 0 294 53
would 0 294 53
cure 0 294 53
stagflation. 0 294 53

He 0 294 54
replied: 0 294 54
“son, 0 294 54
the 1 294 54
military/security 1 294 54
complex 1 294 54
doesn’t 1 294 54
care.” 1 294 54

My 0 294 55
emergence 1 294 55
from 1 294 55
The 1 294 55
Matrix 1 294 55
began 0 294 55
with 0 294 55
Thurmond’s 0 294 55
pat 0 294 55
on 0 294 55
my 0 294 55
shoulder. 0 294 55

It 0 294 56
grew 0 294 56
with 0 294 56
my 0 294 56
time 0 294 56
at 0 294 56
the 0 294 56
Wall 0 294 56
Street 0 294 56
Journal 0 294 56
when 0 294 56
I 0 294 56
learned 0 294 56
that 0 294 56
some 0 294 56
truthful 0 294 56
things 0 294 56
simply 0 294 56
could 0 294 56
not 0 294 56
be 0 294 56
said. 0 294 56

In 0 294 57
the 0 294 57
Treasury 0 294 57
I 0 294 57
experienced 0 294 57
how 0 294 57
those 0 294 57
outside 0 294 57
interests 0 294 57
opposed 0 294 57
to 0 294 57
a 0 294 57
president’s 0 294 57
policy 0 294 57
marshall 1 294 57
their 1 294 57
forces 1 294 57
and 0 294 57
the 0 294 57
media 0 294 57
that 0 294 57
they 0 294 57
own 0 294 57
to 0 294 57
block 0 294 57
it. 0 294 57

Later 0 294 58
as 0 294 58
a 0 294 58
member 0 294 58
of 0 294 58
a 0 294 58
secret 0 294 58
presidential 0 294 58
committee, 0 294 58
I 0 294 58
saw 0 294 58
how 0 294 58
the 0 294 58
CIA 0 294 58
attempted 0 294 58
to 0 294 58
prevent 0 294 58
President 0 294 58
Reagan 0 294 58
from 0 294 58
ending 0 294 58
the 0 294 58
Cold 0 294 58
War. 0 294 58

Today, 1 294 59
right 1 294 59
now, 1 294 59
at 1 294 59
this 1 294 59
moment, 1 294 59
we 1 294 59
are 1 294 59
faced 1 294 59
with 1 294 59
a 1 294 59
massive 1 294 59
effort 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
military/security 1 294 59
complex, 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
neoconservatives, 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
Democratic 1 294 59
Party, 1 294 59
and 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
presstitute 1 294 59
media 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
discredit 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
elected 1 294 59
President 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
United 1 294 59
States 1 294 59
and 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
overthrow 1 294 59
him 1 294 59
in 1 294 59
order 1 294 59
that 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
utterly 1 294 59
corrupt 1 294 59
elite 1 294 59
that 1 294 59
rule 1 294 59
American 1 294 59
can 1 294 59
continue 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
hold 1 294 59
on 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
power 1 294 59
and 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
protect 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
massive 1 294 59
budget 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
military/security 1 294 59
complex 1 294 59
that, 1 294 59
along 1 294 59
with 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
Israel 1 294 59
Lobby, 1 294 59
funds 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
elections 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
those 1 294 59
who 1 294 59
rule 1 294 59
us. 1 294 59

Trump, 0 294 60
like 0 294 60
Reagan, 0 294 60
was 0 294 60
an 0 294 60
exception, 0 294 60
and 0 294 60
it 0 294 60
is 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
exceptions 0 294 60
that 0 294 60
accumulate 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
ire 0 294 60
of 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
corrupt 0 294 60
leftwing, 0 294 60
bought 0 294 60
off 0 294 60
with 0 294 60
money, 0 294 60
and 0 294 60
the 1 294 60
ire 1 294 60
of 1 294 60
the 1 294 60
media, 1 294 60
concentrated 0 294 60
into 0 294 60
small 0 294 60
tight 0 294 60
ownership 0 294 60
groups 0 294 60
indebted 0 294 60
to 0 294 60
those 0 294 60
who 0 294 60
permitted 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
illegal 0 294 60
concentration 0 294 60
of 0 294 60
a 0 294 60
once 0 294 60
independent 0 294 60
and 0 294 60
diverse 0 294 60
American 0 294 60
media 0 294 60
that 0 294 60
once 0 294 60
served, 0 294 60
on 0 294 60
occasion, 0 294 60
as 0 294 60
a 1 294 60
watchdog 1 294 60
over 1 294 60
government. 1 294 60

The 1 294 61
rightwing, 1 294 61
wrapped 1 294 61
in 1 294 61
the 1 294 61
flag, 1 294 61
dismisses 1 294 61
all 1 294 61
truth 1 294 61
as 1 294 61
“anti-American.” 1 294 61

If 0 294 62
Putin, 0 294 62
Lavrov, 0 294 62
the 0 294 62
Russian 0 294 62
government, 0 294 62

the 0 294 62
Iranians, 0 294 62

that 0 294 62
any 0 294 62

can 0 294 62
come 0 294 62
out 0 294 62
of 0 294 62
America, 0 294 62
they 1 294 62
are 1 294 62
insane. 1 294 62

Their 0 294 63
delusions 0 294 63
are 0 294 63
setting 0 294 63
themselves 0 294 63
up 0 294 63
for 0 294 63
destruction. 0 294 63

There 0 294 64
is 0 294 64
no 0 294 64
institution 0 294 64
in 0 294 64
America, 0 294 64
government 0 294 64
or 0 294 64
private, 0 294 64
that 0 294 64
can 0 294 64
be 0 294 64
trusted. 0 294 64

Any 0 294 65
government 0 294 65
or 0 294 65

who 0 294 65
trusts 0 294 65
America 0 294 65
or 0 294 65
any 0 294 65
Western 0 294 65
country 0 294 65
is 0 294 65
stupid 1 294 65
beyond 1 294 65
belief. 1 294 65

The 0 294 66
entire 0 294 66
Russiagate 1 294 66
hoax 1 294 66
is 0 294 66
an 0 294 66

by 0 294 66

The 0 294 67
purpose 0 294 67
is 0 294 67
to 0 294 67
discredit 0 294 67
President 0 294 67
trump 0 294 67
for 0 294 67
two 0 294 67
reasons. 0 294 67

is 0 294 68
to 0 294 68
prevent 0 294 68

of 0 294 68

with 0 294 68

The 0 294 69
other 0 294 69
is 0 294 69
to 0 294 69
remove 0 294 69
Trump’s 0 294 69

Here 0 294 81

what 0 294 81
the 0 294 81
clued-in 0 294 81
Russian 0 294 81
Defense 0 294 81

If 0 294 82
Putin 0 294 82
doesn’t 0 294 82
listen 0 294 82
to 0 294 82
him, 0 294 82
Russia 0 294 82
is 0 294 82
in 1 294 82
the 1 294 82
trash 1 294 82
can 1 294 82
of 1 294 82

Keep 1 294 83
in 1 294 83
mind 1 294 83
that 1 294 83
no 1 294 83
media 1 294 83
informs 1 294 83
you 1 294 83
better 1 294 83
than 1 294 83
my 1 294 83

If 0 294 84
my 0 294 84
website 0 294 84
goes 0 294 84
down, 0 294 84
you 0 294 84
will 0 294 84
be 0 294 84
left 0 294 84
in 0 294 84
darkness. 0 294 84

No 1 294 85
valid 1 294 85
information 1 294 85
comes 1 294 85
from 1 294 85
the 1 294 85
US 1 294 85
government 1 294 85
or 1 294 85
the 1 294 85

If 1 294 86
you 1 294 86
sit 1 294 86
in 1 294 86
front 1 294 86
of 1 294 86

watching 1 294 86
the 1 294 86
Western 1 294 86

you 1 294 86
are 1 294 86
brainwashed 1 294 86
beyond 1 294 86
all 1 294 86
hope. 1 294 86

Not 1 294 87
even 1 294 87
I 1 294 87
can 1 294 87
rescue 1 294 87
you. 1 294 87

Nor 1 294 88
God 1 294 88
himself. 1 294 88

Americans, 0 294 89
and 0 294 89
indeed 0 294 89
the 0 294 89
Russians 0 294 89
themselves, 0 294 89
are 0 294 89
incapable 0 294 89
of 0 294 89
realizing 0 294 89
it, 0 294 89
but 0 294 89
there 0 294 89
is 0 294 89
a 0 294 89
chance 0 294 89
that 0 294 89
Trump 0 294 89
will 0 294 89
be 0 294 89
overthrown 0 294 89
and 0 294 89
a 0 294 89
Western 0 294 89
assault 0 294 89
will 0 294 89
be 0 294 89
launched 0 294 89
against 0 294 89
the 0 294 89
handful 0 294 89
of 0 294 89
countries 0 294 89
that 0 294 89
insist 0 294 89
on 0 294 89
sovereignty. 0 294 89

I 1 294 90
doubt 1 294 90
that 1 294 90
few 1 294 90
of 1 294 90
the 1 294 90
Americans 1 294 90
who 1 294 90
elected 1 294 90
Trump 1 294 90
will 1 294 90
be 1 294 90
taken 1 294 90
in 1 294 90
by 1 294 90
the 1 294 90
anti-Trump 1 294 90
propagana, 1 294 90
but 0 294 90
they 0 294 90
are 0 294 90
not 0 294 90
organized 0 294 90
and 0 294 90
have 0 294 90
no 0 294 90
armed 0 294 90
power. 0 294 90

The 0 294 91
police, 0 294 91
militarized 0 294 91
by 0 294 91
George 0 294 91
W. 0 294 91
Bush 0 294 91
and 0 294 91
Obama, 0 294 91
will 0 294 91
be 0 294 91
set 0 294 91
against 0 294 91
them. 0 294 91

The 0 294 92
rebellions 0 294 92
will 0 294 92
be 0 294 92
local 0 294 92
and 0 294 92
suppressed 0 294 92
by 0 294 92
every 0 294 92
violation 0 294 92
of 0 294 92
the 0 294 92
US 0 294 92
Constitution 0 294 92
by 0 294 92
the 0 294 92

that 0 294 92
rule 0 294 92
Washington, 0 294 92
as 0 294 92
always 0 294 92
has 0 294 92
been 0 294 92
the 0 294 92
case 0 294 92
with 0 294 92
rebellions 0 294 92
in 0 294 92
America. 0 294 92

In 1 294 93
the 1 294 93
West, 1 294 93
which 1 294 93
the 1 294 93
Russians 1 294 93
are 1 294 93
so 1 294 93
anxious 1 294 93
to 1 294 93
join, 1 294 93
all 1 294 93
freedoms 1 294 93
are 1 294 93
dead—freedom 0 294 93
of 0 294 93

freedom 0 294 93
of 0 294 93

freedom 0 294 93
of 0 294 93

freedom 0 294 93
of 0 294 93

freedom 0 294 93
of 0 294 93

freedom 1 294 93
from 0 294 93
arbitrary 0 294 93

along 0 294 93
with 0 294 93
the 0 294 93
Constitutional 0 294 93
protections 0 294 93
of 0 294 93
due 0 294 93
process 0 294 93
and 0 294 93
habeas 0 294 93

Today 1 294 94
there 1 294 94
are 1 294 94
no 1 294 94
countries 1 294 94
less 1 294 94
free 1 294 94
than 1 294 94
the 1 294 94
United 1 294 94

of 1 294 94
America. 1 294 94

Why 0 294 95
do 0 294 95
the 0 294 95
Russian 0 294 95
Atlanticist 0 294 95
Integrationists 0 294 95
want 0 294 95
to 0 294 95
join 0 294 95
an 0 294 95
unfree 0 294 95
Western 0 294 95
world? 0 294 95

Are 0 294 96
they 0 294 96
that 0 294 96
brainwashed 1 294 96
by 0 294 96
Western 0 294 96
Propaganda? 0 294 96

If 0 294 97
Putin 0 294 97
listens 0 294 97
to 0 294 97
these 0 294 97
deluded 1 294 97
fools, 1 294 97
Putin 0 294 97
will 0 294 97
destroy 0 294 97
Russia. 0 294 97

There 0 294 98
is 0 294 98
something 0 294 98
wrong 0 294 98
with 0 294 98
Russian 0 294 98
perception 0 294 98
of 0 294 98
Washington. 0 294 98

Apparently 0 294 99
the 0 294 99
Russian 0 294 99
elite, 0 294 99
with 0 294 99
the 0 294 99
exception 0 294 99
of 0 294 99
Shoigu 0 294 99
and 0 294 99
a 0 294 99
few 0 294 99
others 0 294 99
are 0 294 99
incapable 0 294 99
of 0 294 99
comprehending 0 294 99
the 0 294 99
neoconservative 0 294 99
drive 0 294 99
for 0 294 99
US 0 294 99
world 0 294 99

determination 0 294 99
to 0 294 99

as 0 294 99
a 0 294 99

on 0 294 99

unilateralism. 0 294 99

The 0 294 100
Russian 0 294 100
government 0 294 100
somehow, 0 294 100
despite 0 294 100
all 0 294 100
evidence 0 294 100
to 0 294 100
the 0 294 100

Recently, 0 77 5
I 0 77 5
received 0 77 5
a 0 77 5
newspaper 0 77 5
article 0 77 5
from 0 77 5
a 1 77 5
confused, 1 77 5
biblically 1 77 5
illiterate 1 77 5
friend 1 77 5
asking 0 77 5
me 0 77 5
what 0 77 5
my 0 77 5
take 0 77 5
was 0 77 5
on 0 77 5
an 0 77 5
article 0 77 5
titled, 0 77 5
“Scripture 0 77 5
teaches 0 77 5
to 0 77 5
submit 0 77 5
to 0 77 5
authorities” 0 77 5
with 0 77 5
reference 0 77 5
to 0 77 5
Romans 0 77 5
Chapter 0 77 5
13. 0 77 5

In 0 77 6
this 0 77 6
article, 0 77 6
the 0 77 6
author 0 77 6
was 0 77 6
calling 0 77 6
out 0 77 6
a 0 77 6
Christian 0 77 6
for 0 77 6
protesting 0 77 6
a 0 77 6
corrupt 0 77 6
representative 0 77 6
in 0 77 6
government, 0 77 6
even 0 77 6
going 0 77 6
so 0 77 6
far 0 77 6
as 0 77 6
to 0 77 6
suggest 0 77 6
this 1 77 6
protestant 1 77 6
ought 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
have 1 77 6
stayed 1 77 6
home 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
read 1 77 6
their 1 77 6
Bible 1 77 6
rather 1 77 6
than 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
protest 1 77 6
corruption 1 77 6
in 1 77 6
government. 1 77 6

He 0 77 7
went 0 77 7
onto 0 77 7
say 0 77 7
that 0 77 7
we 0 77 7
are 0 77 7
commanded 0 77 7
by 0 77 7
Scripture 0 77 7
to 0 77 7
submit 0 77 7
to 0 77 7
the 0 77 7
authorities 0 77 7
that 0 77 7
have 0 77 7
been 0 77 7
elected. 0 77 7

To 0 77 8
start 0 77 8
off, 0 77 8
maybe 1 77 8
this 1 77 8
individual 1 77 8
should 1 77 8
take 1 77 8
the 1 77 8
time 1 77 8
to 1 77 8
know 1 77 8
a 1 77 8
little 1 77 8
bit 1 77 8
of 1 77 8
his 1 77 8
own 1 77 8
history! 1 77 8

There 1 77 9
is 1 77 9
nothing 1 77 9
worse 1 77 9
than 1 77 9
when 1 77 9
a 1 77 9

every 0 77 36

be 0 77 36

unto 0 77 36

there 0 77 37
is 0 77 37
no 0 77 37
power 0 77 37

Whosoever 1 77 38
therefore 1 77 38
resisteth 1 77 38
the 1 77 38
power, 1 77 38
resisteth 1 77 38
the 1 77 38

God: 1 77 38
and 1 77 38
they 1 77 38
that 1 77 38
resist 1 77 38
shall 1 77 38
receive 1 77 38
to 1 77 38
themselves 1 77 38
damnation. 1 77 38

a 0 77 39
terror 0 77 39
to 0 77 39

Wilt 0 77 40
thou 0 77 40

not 0 77 40
be 0 77 40

of 0 77 40
the 0 77 40

do 0 77 41
that 0 77 41
which 0 77 41
is 0 77 41
good, 0 77 41
and 0 77 41
thou 0 77 41
shalt 0 77 41
have 0 77 41
praise 0 77 41
of 0 77 41
the 0 77 41
same: 0 77 41

For 0 77 42
he 0 77 42
is 0 77 42
the 0 77 42
minister 0 77 42

God 0 77 42
to 0 77 42
thee 0 77 42
for 0 77 42

But 0 77 43
if 0 77 43
thou 0 77 43

that 0 77 43
which 0 77 43
is 0 77 43
evil, 0 77 43
be 0 77 43

he 0 77 43
beareth 0 77 43
not 0 77 43
the 0 77 43

him 1 77 43
that 1 77 43
doeth 1 77 43
evil. 1 77 43

Wherefore 0 77 44
ye 0 77 44
must 0 77 44
needs 0 77 44
be 0 77 44
subject, 0 77 44
not 0 77 44
only 0 77 44
for 0 77 44
wrath, 0 77 44
but 0 77 44
also 0 77 44
for 0 77 44

For 0 77 45
for 0 77 45
this 0 77 45

ye 0 77 45

also: 0 77 45
for 0 77 45
they 0 77 45
are 0 77 45
God's 0 77 45
ministers, 0 77 45
attending 0 77 45
continually 0 77 45
upon 0 77 45
this 0 77 45
very 0 77 45
thing. 0 77 45

Render 0 77 46
therefore 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
all 0 77 46
their 0 77 46
dues: 0 77 46
tribute 0 77 46

The 0 77 47

God 0 77 50
ordained 0 77 50
the 0 77 50
power, 0 77 50
and 0 77 50
that 0 77 50
“rulers 0 77 50

Of 1 77 54
course 1 77 54
not! 1 77 54

If 0 77 55
He 0 77 55
did, 0 77 55
that 0 77 55
would 0 77 55
make 0 77 55

unjust. 0 77 55

Jesus 0 77 56
said, 0 77 56
"Think 0 77 56
not 0 77 56

We 0 77 59
are 0 77 59
to 0 77 59
“have 0 77 59
no 0 77 59
fellowship 0 77 59

the 0 77 59
unfruitful 1 77 59
works 1 77 59
of 1 77 59
darkness, 1 77 59

rather 0 77 59
reprove 0 77 59
(expose) 0 77 59
them” 0 77 59
(Ephesians 0 77 59
5:11). 0 77 59

Furthermore, 0 77 60
it 0 77 60
would 0 77 60
contradict 0 77 60
what 0 77 60
Scripture 0 77 60

us 0 77 60
from 0 77 60

“We 1 77 61

I 1 77 67
ask, 1 77 67
are 1 77 67
Christians 1 77 67
to 1 77 67
submit 1 77 67
to 1 77 67
those 1 77 67
who 1 77 67
have 1 77 67
sanctioned 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
murder 1 77 67
of 1 77 67
the 1 77 67

womb 1 77 67
(Exodus 0 77 67

Proverbs 0 77 67
6:17)? 0 77 67

Absolutely 1 77 68
not! 1 77 68

Are 1 77 69
Christians 1 77 69
to 1 77 69
submit 1 77 69
to 1 77 69
those 1 77 69
who 1 77 69
have 1 77 69
redefined 1 77 69
marriage 1 77 69
where 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
man 1 77 69
can 1 77 69
now 1 77 69
"marry" 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
man 1 77 69
and 1 77 69
a 1 77 69

can 1 77 69
now 1 77 69

Absolutely 1 77 70
not! 1 77 70

Submit 1 77 71
to 1 77 71
those 1 77 71
who 1 77 71
lie 1 77 71
continuously, 1 77 71
to 1 77 71
them 1 77 71
that 1 77 71

Absolutely 1 77 72
not! 1 77 72

Submit 0 77 73
to 0 77 73
what 0 77 73
God 0 77 73
condemns? 0 77 73

Yet, 0 77 74
this 0 77 74
is 0 77 74
what 0 77 74
the 1 77 74
perverse, 1 77 74
modern-day, 1 77 74
professing 1 77 74
Christians 1 77 74
are 0 77 74

the 0 77 74
American 0 77 74

It 0 77 75
would 0 77 75
do 0 77 75
you 0 77 75
well 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
now 0 77 75
look 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
Christ 0 77 75
when 0 77 75
He 0 77 75
said 0 77 75
that 0 77 75
we 0 77 75
are 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
beware 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
leaven 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
Pharisee’s 0 77 75
(corrupt 0 77 75
doctrines 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
those 0 77 75
who 0 77 75
claimed 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
be 0 77 75
the 1 77 75
children 1 77 75
of 1 77 75
God), 1 77 75
as 0 77 75
well 0 77 75
as 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
leaven 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
Herod 0 77 75
(corrupt 0 77 75
doctrines 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
government) 0 77 75
(Mark 0 77 75
8:15). 0 77 75

If 0 77 76
you 0 77 76
remember, 0 77 76
it 0 77 76
was 0 77 76
those 0 77 76
same 0 77 76
people 0 77 76
who 0 77 76
called 0 77 76
for 0 77 76
the 0 77 76
crucifixion 0 77 76
of 0 77 76
Christ 0 77 76
while 0 77 76
crying 1 77 76
out 1 77 76
“We 0 77 76
have 0 77 76
no 0 77 76
King 0 77 76
but 0 77 76
Caesar” 0 77 76
(John 0 77 76
19:15). 0 77 76

Do 0 77 77
these 0 77 77
that 0 77 77
teach 1 77 77
such 1 77 77
heresy 1 77 77
not 0 77 77
realize 0 77 77
that 0 77 77
every 0 77 77
apostle, 0 77 77
except 0 77 77
John, 0 77 77
was 0 77 77

by 0 77 77
hostile 1 77 77
corrupt 1 77 77
civil 1 77 77
authorities 1 77 77
opposed 0 77 77
to 0 77 77
their 0 77 77
endeavors? 0 77 77

Christians 0 77 78
throughout 0 77 78
history 0 77 78
were 0 77 78
imprisoned, 0 77 78
tortured, 0 77 78
or 0 77 78
killed 0 77 78
by 0 77 78
corrupt 1 77 78
civil 1 77 78
authorities 1 77 78
of 1 77 78
all 1 77 78
stripes 1 77 78
for 0 77 78
refusing 0 77 78
to 0 77 78
submit 0 77 78
to 0 77 78
their 0 77 78
various, 0 77 78
lawless 0 77 78
policies 0 77 78
and 0 77 78
prohibitions. 0 77 78

Did 0 77 79
Christian 0 77 79
martyrs 0 77 79
violate 0 77 79
God’s 0 77 79
principles 0 77 79
of 0 77 79
submission 0 77 79
to 0 77 79
authority? 0 77 79

Of 1 77 80
course, 1 77 80
not. 1 77 80

Also, 0 77 81
keep 0 77 81
in 0 77 81
mind 0 77 81
that 0 77 81
magistrates 0 77 81
have 0 77 81
limited 0 77 81
and 0 77 81
defined 0 77 81
authority 0 77 81
in 0 77 81
civil 0 77 81
matters. 0 77 81

Take 0 77 82
note 0 77 82
that 0 77 82
civil 0 77 82
government 0 77 82
is 0 77 82
to 0 77 82
be, 0 77 82
and 0 77 82
must 0 77 82
be, 0 77 82
a 1 77 82
“terror 1 77 82
to 1 77 82
good 1 77 82
works.” 1 77 82
It 0 77 82
has 0 77 82
no 0 77 82
power 0 77 82
or 0 77 82
authority 0 77 82
to 0 77 82
terrorize 0 77 82
good 0 77 82
works 0 77 82
or 0 77 82
good, 1 77 82
law-abiding 1 77 82
people. 1 77 82

God 0 77 83
never 0 77 83
gave 0 77 83
them 0 77 83
that 0 77 83
authority 0 77 83
and 0 77 83
any, 0 77 83
and 0 77 83
all, 0 77 83
government 0 77 83
that 0 77 83
oversteps 0 77 83
the 0 77 83
divine 0 77 83
authority 0 77 83
and 0 77 83
its 0 77 83
boundaries 0 77 83
has 0 77 83
no 0 77 83
divine 0 77 83
authority 0 77 83
or 0 77 83
protection. 0 77 83

Civil 0 77 84
government 0 77 84
is 0 77 84
a 0 77 84
“minister 0 77 84

(Romans 0 77 84

It 0 77 85
is 0 77 85
not 0 77 85
a 0 77 85
minister 0 77 85
of 0 77 85
God 0 77 85
for 0 77 85

Civil 0 77 86
magistrates 0 77 86
have 0 77 86
a 0 77 86

to 0 77 86
“execute 1 77 86

him 1 77 86
that 1 77 86

evil.” 1 77 86
Anyone 1 77 86
who 1 77 86
teaches 1 77 86
that 1 77 86

upon 1 77 86
"him 1 77 86
that 1 77 86
doeth 1 77 86
good” 1 77 86
is 1 77 86
ignorant 1 77 86
and 1 77 86
uneducated 1 77 86
in 1 77 86
their 1 77 86
misleadings 1 77 86
(1 0 77 86

submit 0 77 87
to 0 77 87
evil 1 77 87
civil 1 77 87
authority 1 77 87
is 0 77 87
teaching 0 77 87
the 0 77 87
opposite 0 77 87
of 0 77 87
what 0 77 87
is 0 77 87
true. 0 77 87

Common 0 77 88
sense 0 77 88

here. 0 77 88

I 0 77 89
ask, 0 77 89
did 0 77 89
Moses 0 77 89
violate 0 77 89
God's 0 77 89
principle 0 77 89
of 0 77 89
submission 0 77 89
when 0 77 89
he 0 77 89
was 0 77 89
commanded 0 77 89
by 0 77 89
God, 0 77 89
“Go 0 77 89
in 0 77 89
unto 0 77 89
Pharaoh, 0 77 89
and 0 77 89
tell 0 77 89
him, 0 77 89
Thus 0 77 89
saith 0 77 89
the 1 77 89
LORD 1 77 89
God 1 77 89
of 1 77 89
the 1 77 89
Hebrews, 1 77 89
Let 0 77 89
my 0 77 89
people 0 77 89
go, 0 77 89
that 0 77 89
they 0 77 89
may 0 77 89
serve 0 77 89
me” 0 77 89
(Exodus 0 77 89
9:1). 0 77 89

And 0 77 90
when 0 77 90
Pharaoh 0 77 90
refused, 0 77 90
God 0 77 90
plagued 0 77 90
the 0 77 90
Pharaoh 0 77 90
and 0 77 90
the 0 77 90
Egyptians 0 77 90
and 0 77 90
set 0 77 90
His 0 77 90
children 0 77 90
free. 0 77 90

Think 0 77 91
of 0 77 91
this, 0 77 91
the 1 77 91
meekest 1 77 91
man 1 77 91
alive 1 77 91
was 0 77 91
sent 0 77 91
to 0 77 91
the 0 77 91
face 0 77 91
of 0 77 91
the 0 77 91
Pharaoh 0 77 91

tell 1 77 91
him 1 77 91
to 1 77 91
obey 1 77 91
or 1 77 91
else. 1 77 91

Is 0 77 92
this 0 77 92
what 0 77 92
is 0 77 92
being 0 77 92
preached 0 77 92
from 0 77 92
the 0 77 92
pulpits 0 77 92
across 0 77 92
America 0 77 92
today? 0 77 92

Or 0 77 93
what 0 77 93
of 0 77 93
Gideon 0 77 93
who 0 77 93
was 0 77 93
to 0 77 93
deliver 0 77 93
the 0 77 93
Children 0 77 93
of 0 77 93
Israel 0 77 93
from 0 77 93
the 0 77 93
Midianites? 0 77 93

The 0 77 94
first 0 77 94
thing 0 77 94
the 0 77 94
Lord 0 77 94
commanded 0 77 94
him 0 77 94
to 0 77 94
do 0 77 94
was 0 77 94
to 0 77 94
tear 0 77 94
down 0 77 94
his 0 77 94
father's 0 77 94
altars 0 77 94
(Judges 0 77 94
6:25). 0 77 94

Was 0 77 95
this 0 77 95
a 0 77 95
violation 0 77 95
of 0 77 95
God's 0 77 95
principles 0 77 95
of 0 77 95
submission? 0 77 95

The 0 77 96
sins 0 77 96
of 0 77 96
the 0 77 96
fathers 0 77 96
were 0 77 96
the 0 77 96
reason 0 77 96
the 0 77 96
Midianites 0 77 96
had 0 77 96
power 0 77 96
to 0 77 96
oppress 0 77 96
them. 0 77 96

What 0 77 97
of 0 77 97
that 0 77 97
lone 0 77 97
prophet, 0 77 97
Elijah? 0 77 97

The 1 77 98
tyrant 1 77 98
Ahab 0 77 98
called 0 77 98
him 0 77 98
the 1 77 98
troubler 1 77 98
of 1 77 98
Israel. 1 77 98

Elijah 0 77 99
set 0 77 99
the 0 77 99
record 0 77 99
straight 0 77 99
when 0 77 99
he 0 77 99
answered, 0 77 99
"I 0 77 99
have 0 77 99
not 0 77 99

now 0 77 131
eventide. 0 77 131

Howbeit 0 77 132
many 0 77 132
of 0 77 132
them 0 77 132
which 0 77 132
heard 0 77 132
the 0 77 132
word 0 77 132
believed; 0 77 132
and 0 77 132
the 0 77 132
number 0 77 132
of 0 77 132
the 0 77 132
men 0 77 132
was 0 77 132
about 0 77 132
five 0 77 132
thousand. 0 77 132

And 0 77 133
it 0 77 133
came 0 77 133
to 0 77 133
pass 0 77 133
on 0 77 133
the 0 77 133
morrow, 0 77 133
that 0 77 133
their 0 77 133
rulers, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
elders, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
scribes, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
Annas 0 77 133
the 0 77 133
high 0 77 133
priest, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
Caiaphas, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
John, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
Alexander, 0 77 133
and 0 77 133
as 0 77 133
many 0 77 133
as 0 77 133
were 0 77 133
of 0 77 133
the 0 77 133
kindred 0 77 133
of 0 77 133
the 0 77 133
high 0 77 133
priest, 0 77 133
were 0 77 133
gathered 0 77 133
together 0 77 133
at 0 77 133
Jerusalem. 0 77 133

And 0 77 134
when 0 77 134
they 0 77 134
had 0 77 134
set 0 77 134
them 0 77 134
in 0 77 134
the 0 77 134
midst, 0 77 134
they 0 77 134
asked, 0 77 134
By 0 77 134
what 0 77 134
power, 0 77 134
or 0 77 134
by 0 77 134
what 0 77 134
name, 0 77 134
have 0 77 134
ye 0 77 134
done 0 77 134
this? 0 77 134

Then 0 77 135
Peter, 0 77 135
filled 0 77 135
with 0 77 135
the 0 77 135
Holy 0 77 135
Ghost, 0 77 135
said 0 77 135
unto 0 77 135
them, 0 77 135
Ye 0 77 135
rulers 0 77 135
of 0 77 135
the 0 77 135
people, 0 77 135
and 0 77 135
elders 0 77 135
of 0 77 135
Israel, 0 77 135

If 0 77 136
we 0 77 136
this 0 77 136
day 0 77 136
be 0 77 136
examined 0 77 136
of 0 77 136
the 0 77 136
good 0 77 136
deed 0 77 136
done 0 77 136
to 0 77 136
the 1 77 136
impotent 1 77 136
man, 1 77 136
by 0 77 136
what 0 77 136
means 0 77 136
he 0 77 136
is 0 77 136
made 0 77 136
whole; 0 77 136

Be 0 77 137
it 0 77 137
known 0 77 137
unto 0 77 137
you 0 77 137
all, 0 77 137
and 0 77 137
to 0 77 137
all 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
people 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Israel, 0 77 137
that 0 77 137
by 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
name 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Jesus 0 77 137
Christ 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Nazareth, 0 77 137
whom 0 77 137
ye 0 77 137
crucified, 0 77 137
whom 0 77 137
God 0 77 137
raised 0 77 137
from 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
dead, 0 77 137
even 0 77 137
by 0 77 137
him 0 77 137
doth 0 77 137
this 0 77 137
man 0 77 137
stand 0 77 137
here 0 77 137
before 0 77 137
you 0 77 137
whole. 0 77 137

This 0 77 138
is 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
stone 0 77 138
which 0 77 138
was 0 77 138
set 0 77 138
at 0 77 138
nought 0 77 138
of 0 77 138
you 0 77 138
builders, 0 77 138
which 0 77 138
is 0 77 138
become 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
head 0 77 138
of 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
corner. 0 77 138

Neither 0 77 139
is 0 77 139
there 0 77 139
salvation 0 77 139
in 0 77 139
any 0 77 139
other: 0 77 139
for 0 77 139
there 0 77 139
is 0 77 139
none 0 77 139
other 0 77 139
name 0 77 139
under 0 77 139
heaven 0 77 139
given 0 77 139
among 0 77 139
men, 0 77 139
whereby 0 77 139
we 0 77 139
must 0 77 139
be 0 77 139
saved. 0 77 139

Now 0 77 140
when 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
saw 0 77 140
the 0 77 140
boldness 0 77 140
of 0 77 140
Peter 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
John, 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
perceived 0 77 140
that 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
were 0 77 140
unlearned 1 77 140
and 1 77 140
ignorant 1 77 140
men, 1 77 140
they 0 77 140
marvelled; 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
took 0 77 140
knowledge 0 77 140
of 0 77 140
them, 0 77 140
that 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
had 0 77 140
been 0 77 140
with 0 77 140
Jesus. 0 77 140

And 0 77 141
beholding 0 77 141
the 0 77 141
man 0 77 141
which 0 77 141
was 0 77 141
healed 0 77 141
standing 0 77 141
with 0 77 141
them, 0 77 141
they 0 77 141
could 0 77 141
say 0 77 141
nothing 0 77 141
against 0 77 141
it. 0 77 141

But 0 77 142
when 0 77 142
they 0 77 142
had 0 77 142
commanded 0 77 142
them 0 77 142
to 0 77 142
go 0 77 142
aside 0 77 142
out 0 77 142
of 0 77 142
the 0 77 142
council, 0 77 142
they 0 77 142
conferred 0 77 142
among 0 77 142
themselves, 0 77 142

Saying, 0 77 143
What 0 77 143
shall 0 77 143
we 0 77 143
do 0 77 143
to 0 77 143
these 0 77 143
men? 0 77 143

for 0 77 144
that 0 77 144
indeed 0 77 144
a 0 77 144
notable 0 77 144
miracle 0 77 144
hath 0 77 144
been 0 77 144
done 0 77 144
by 0 77 144
them 0 77 144
is 0 77 144
manifest 0 77 144
to 0 77 144
all 0 77 144
them 0 77 144
that 0 77 144
dwell 0 77 144
in 0 77 144
Jerusalem; 0 77 144
and 0 77 144
we 0 77 144
cannot 0 77 144
deny 0 77 144
it. 0 77 144

But 0 77 145
that 0 77 145
it 0 77 145
spread 0 77 145
no 0 77 145
further 0 77 145
among 0 77 145
the 0 77 145
people, 0 77 145
let 0 77 145
us 0 77 145
straitly 0 77 145
threaten 0 77 145
them, 0 77 145
that 0 77 145
they 0 77 145
speak 0 77 145
henceforth 0 77 145
to 0 77 145
no 0 77 145
man 0 77 145
in 0 77 145
this 0 77 145
name. 0 77 145

And 0 77 146
they 0 77 146
called 0 77 146
them, 0 77 146
and 0 77 146
commanded 0 77 146
them 0 77 146
not 0 77 146
to 0 77 146
speak 0 77 146
at 0 77 146
all 0 77 146
nor 0 77 146
teach 0 77 146
in 0 77 146
the 0 77 146
name 0 77 146
of 0 77 146
Jesus. 0 77 146

But 0 77 147
Peter 0 77 147
and 0 77 147
John 0 77 147
answered 0 77 147
and 0 77 147
said 0 77 147
unto 0 77 147
them, 0 77 147
Whether 0 77 147
it 0 77 147
be 0 77 147
right 0 77 147
in 0 77 147
the 0 77 147
sight 0 77 147
of 0 77 147
God 0 77 147
to 0 77 147
hearken 0 77 147
unto 0 77 147
you 0 77 147
more 0 77 147
than 0 77 147
unto 0 77 147
God, 0 77 147
judge 0 77 147
ye. 0 77 147

For 0 77 148
we 0 77 148
cannot 0 77 148
but 0 77 148
speak 0 77 148
the 0 77 148
things 0 77 148
which 0 77 148
we 0 77 148
have 0 77 148
seen 0 77 148
and 0 77 148
heard.” 0 77 148
Acts 0 77 148
4:2-20 0 77 148

Or 0 77 149
what 0 77 149
of 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
account 0 77 149
found 0 77 149
in 0 77 149
Acts 0 77 149
12:1-11, 0 77 149
where 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
Lord 0 77 149
sent 0 77 149
an 0 77 149
Angel 0 77 149
to 0 77 149
liberate 0 77 149
Peter 0 77 149
from 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
hands 0 77 149
of 0 77 149
tyrants. 1 77 149

“Now 0 77 150
about 0 77 150
that 0 77 150
time 0 77 150
Herod 0 77 150
the 0 77 150
king 0 77 150
stretched 0 77 150
forth 0 77 150
his 0 77 150
hands 0 77 150
to 0 77 150
vex 0 77 150
certain 0 77 150
of 0 77 150
the 0 77 150
church. 0 77 150

And 0 77 151
he 0 77 151
killed 0 77 151
James 0 77 151
the 0 77 151
brother 0 77 151
of 0 77 151
John 0 77 151
with 0 77 151
the 0 77 151
sword. 0 77 151

And 0 77 152
because 0 77 152
he 0 77 152
saw 0 77 152
it 0 77 152
pleased 0 77 152
the 0 77 152
Jews, 0 77 152
he 0 77 152
proceeded 0 77 152
further 0 77 152
to 0 77 152
take 0 77 152
Peter 0 77 152
also. 0 77 152

(Then 0 77 153
were 0 77 153
the 0 77 153
days 0 77 153
of 0 77 153
unleavened 0 77 153
bread.) 0 77 153

And 0 77 154
when 0 77 154
he 0 77 154
had 0 77 154
apprehended 0 77 154
him, 0 77 154
he 0 77 154
put 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
in 0 77 154
prison, 0 77 154
and 0 77 154
delivered 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
four 0 77 154
quaternions 0 77 154
of 0 77 154
soldiers 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
keep 0 77 154
him; 0 77 154
intending 0 77 154
after 0 77 154
Easter 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
bring 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
forth 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
the 0 77 154
people. 0 77 154

Peter 0 77 155
therefore 0 77 155
was 0 77 155
kept 0 77 155
in 0 77 155
prison: 0 77 155
but 0 77 155
prayer 0 77 155
was 0 77 155
made 0 77 155
without 0 77 155
ceasing 0 77 155
of 0 77 155
the 0 77 155
church 0 77 155
unto 0 77 155
God 0 77 155
for 0 77 155
him. 0 77 155

And 0 77 156
when 0 77 156
Herod 0 77 156
would 0 77 156
have 0 77 156
brought 0 77 156
him 0 77 156
forth, 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
same 0 77 156
night 0 77 156
Peter 0 77 156
was 0 77 156
sleeping 0 77 156
between 0 77 156
two 0 77 156
soldiers, 0 77 156
bound 0 77 156
with 0 77 156
two 0 77 156
chains: 0 77 156
and 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
keepers 0 77 156
before 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
door 0 77 156
kept 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
prison. 0 77 156

And, 0 77 157
behold, 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
angel 0 77 157
of 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
Lord 0 77 157
came 0 77 157
upon 0 77 157
him, 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
a 0 77 157
light 0 77 157
shined 0 77 157
in 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
prison: 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
he 0 77 157
smote 0 77 157
Peter 0 77 157
on 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
side, 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
raised 0 77 157
him 0 77 157
up, 0 77 157
saying, 0 77 157
Arise 0 77 157
up 0 77 157
quickly. 0 77 157

And 0 77 158
his 0 77 158
chains 0 77 158
fell 0 77 158
off 0 77 158
from 0 77 158
his 0 77 158
hands. 0 77 158

And 0 77 159
the 0 77 159
angel 0 77 159
said 0 77 159
unto 0 77 159
him, 0 77 159
Gird 0 77 159
thyself, 0 77 159
and 0 77 159
bind 0 77 159
on 0 77 159
thy 0 77 159
sandals. 0 77 159

And 0 77 160
so 0 77 160
he 0 77 160
did. 0 77 160

And 0 77 161
he 0 77 161
saith 0 77 161
unto 0 77 161
him, 0 77 161
Cast 0 77 161
thy 0 77 161
garment 0 77 161
about 0 77 161
thee, 0 77 161
and 0 77 161
follow 0 77 161
me. 0 77 161

And 0 77 162
he 0 77 162
went 0 77 162
out, 0 77 162
and 0 77 162
followed 0 77 162
him; 0 77 162
and 0 77 162
wist 0 77 162
not 0 77 162
that 0 77 162
it 0 77 162
was 0 77 162
true 0 77 162
which 0 77 162
was 0 77 162
done 0 77 162
by 0 77 162
the 0 77 162
angel; 0 77 162
but 0 77 162
thought 0 77 162
he 0 77 162
saw 0 77 162
a 0 77 162
vision. 0 77 162

When 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
were 0 77 163
past 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
first 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
second 0 77 163
ward, 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
came 0 77 163
unto 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
iron 0 77 163
gate 0 77 163
that 0 77 163
leadeth 0 77 163
unto 0 77 163
the 0 77 163

even 0 297 30
a 0 297 30
registration 0 297 30
process 0 297 30
for 0 297 30
printers 0 297 30
are 0 297 30
easily 0 297 30
defeated. 0 297 30

Even 0 297 31
if 0 297 31
printers 0 297 31
are 0 297 31
registered 0 297 31
with 0 297 31
the 0 297 31
government, 0 297 31
what 0 297 31
is 0 297 31
going 0 297 31
to 0 297 31
stop 0 297 31
gangs 0 297 31
from 0 297 31
stealing 0 297 31
them? 0 297 31

And 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
designs 0 297 32
for 0 297 32
making 0 297 32
your 0 297 32
own 0 297 32

been 0 297 32
available 0 297 32
on 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
Internet 0 297 32
for 0 297 32
years. 0 297 32

3D 0 297 33
printers 0 297 33
make 1 297 33
the 1 297 33
already 1 297 33
extremely 1 297 33
difficult 1 297 33
job 1 297 33
of 1 297 33
controlling 1 297 33
access 1 297 33
to 1 297 33
guns 1 297 33
practically 1 297 33
impossible. 1 297 33

The 0 297 34
government 0 297 34
is 0 297 34
not 0 297 34
going 0 297 34
to 0 297 34
be 0 297 34
able 0 297 34
to 0 297 34
ban 0 297 34
guns, 0 297 34
and 0 297 34
limits 0 297 34
on 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
size 0 297 34
of 0 297 34
bullet 0 297 34
magazines 0 297 34
will 0 297 34
be 0 297 34
even 1 297 34
more 1 297 34
laughable 1 297 34
than 0 297 34
before. 0 297 34

Many 0 297 35
parts 0 297 35
of 0 297 35
a 0 297 35
gun 0 297 35
can 0 297 35
be 0 297 35
made 0 297 35
on 0 297 35
very 0 297 35
inexpensive, 0 297 35
plastic 0 297 35
3D 0 297 35
printers 0 297 35
or 0 297 35
even 0 297 35
from 0 297 35
simple 0 297 35
machine 0 297 35
tools. 0 297 35

It 0 297 36
will 0 297 36
be 0 297 36
even 0 297 36
more 0 297 36
difficult 0 297 36
to 0 297 36
impose 0 297 36
background 0 297 36
checks, 0 297 36
which 1 297 36
have 1 297 36
proven 1 297 36
quite 1 297 36
useless 1 297 36
anyway. 1 297 36

The 1 297 37
government 1 297 37
has 1 297 37
been 1 297 37
no 1 297 37
more 1 297 37
effective 1 297 37
at 1 297 37
stopping 1 297 37
criminals 1 297 37
from 1 297 37
getting 1 297 37
guns 1 297 37
than 1 297 37
at 1 297 37
stopping 1 297 37
them 1 297 37
from 1 297 37
obtaining 1 297 37
drugs. 1 297 37

That 0 297 38
isn’t 0 297 38
too 0 297 38
surprising, 0 297 38
as 0 297 38
drug 0 297 38
gangs 0 297 38
are 0 297 38
the 0 297 38
source 0 297 38
of 0 297 38
both 0 297 38
illegal 0 297 38
drugs 0 297 38
and 0 297 38
guns. 0 297 38

This 0 297 39
was 0 297 39
a 0 297 39
tough 0 297 39
battle 0 297 39
for 0 297 39
the 0 297 39
plaintiff's, 0 297 39
SAF 0 297 39
and 0 297 39
DD. 0 297 39

They 0 297 40
lost 0 297 40
many 0 297 40
lower 0 297 40
court 0 297 40
rulings. 0 297 40

Gun-control 0 297 41
advocates 0 297 41
believe 0 297 41
that 0 297 41
the 1 297 41
government 1 297 41
"capitulated" 1 297 41
too 0 297 41
soon. 0 297 41

said 0 297 42
the 1 297 42
administration 1 297 42
“capitulated 1 297 42

a 0 297 42

every 0 297 42
step 0 297 42
of 0 297 42
the 0 297 42
way. 0 297 42

This 1 297 43
isn’t 1 297 43
a 1 297 43
case 1 297 43
where 1 297 43
the 1 297 43
underlying 1 297 43
facts 1 297 43
of 1 297 43
the 1 297 43

changed. 1 297 43

The 1 297 44
only 1 297 44
thing 1 297 44
that 1 297 44
changed 1 297 44
was 1 297 44
the 1 297 44
administration.” 1 297 44

The 0 297 45
concept 0 297 45
of 0 297 45
making 0 297 45
guns 0 297 45
with 0 297 45
3D 0 297 45

just 0 297 45
one 0 297 45

can 0 297 45
render 0 297 45
much 0 297 45
technology 0 297 45
obsolete 0 297 45
shouldn't 0 297 45
surprise 0 297 45
anyone. 0 297 45

should 0 297 46
the 0 297 46

click 0 297 47
of 0 297 47
a 0 297 47

almost 0 297 47
any 0 297 47

we 0 297 47

ability 0 297 48
to 0 297 48
build 0 297 48
an 0 297 48
untraceable, 0 297 48

is 0 297 48
definitely 0 297 48
a 1 297 48

topped 0 298 6
out 0 298 6
yet, 0 298 6
at 0 298 6
121, 0 298 6
nearly 0 298 6
all 0 298 6
of 0 298 6
them 0 298 6
expressing 0 298 6
outrage 1 298 6
at 0 298 6
this 0 298 6
cavalier 0 298 6
attitude 0 298 6
toward 0 298 6
the 0 298 6
revelation 0 298 6
that 0 298 6
Cardinal 0 298 6
McCarrick 0 298 6
has 0 298 6
been 0 298 6

a 1 298 6
life-long 1 298 6

or 0 298 6
kept 0 298 6
quiet 0 298 6
about 0 298 6
it. 0 298 6

It’s 0 298 7
clear 0 298 7
that 0 298 7
even 0 298 7
the 0 298 7
“good 0 298 7
bishops” 0 298 7
have 0 298 7
simply 0 298 7
no 0 298 7
idea 0 298 7
how 0 298 7
close 0 298 7
they 0 298 7
are 0 298 7
to 0 298 7
being 0 298 7
bodily 0 298 7
chucked 0 298 7
out 0 298 7
of 0 298 7
their 0 298 7
own 0 298 7
churches 0 298 7
by 0 298 7
furious 0 298 7
mobs. 0 298 7

As 0 298 8
I 0 298 8
wrote 0 298 8
elsewhere, 0 298 8
since 0 298 8
2002, 0 298 8
most 0 298 8
Catholics 0 298 8
know 0 298 8
perfectly 1 298 8
well, 0 298 8
despite 0 298 8
the 0 298 8
lame 1 298 8
whitewashing 0 298 8
attempt, 0 298 8
that 0 298 8
“the 0 298 8
US 0 298 8
bishops 0 298 8
gave 0 298 8
themselves 0 298 8
a 0 298 8
pass” 0 298 8
on 0 298 8
clerical 0 298 8
sex 0 298 8
abuse 0 298 8
with 0 298 8
the 0 298 8
Dallas 0 298 8
Charter 0 298 8
“a 0 298 8
thing 0 298 8
that 0 298 8
brazenly 0 298 8
shifted 0 298 8
blame.” 0 298 8
And 0 298 8
it 0 298 8
seems 0 298 8
that 0 298 8
though 0 298 8
they’re 0 298 8
still 0 298 8
doing 0 298 8
this, 0 298 8
quite 0 298 8
a 0 298 8
few 0 298 8
lay 0 298 8
Catholics 0 298 8
just 0 298 8
aren’t 0 298 8
having 0 298 8
it. 0 298 8

We 0 298 9
are 0 298 9
seeing 0 298 9
the 0 298 9
final 0 298 9
slide, 0 298 9
the 0 298 9
expected 0 298 9
and 0 298 9
inevitable 0 298 9
result 0 298 9
of 0 298 9
the 0 298 9
last 0 298 9
100 0 298 9
years. 0 298 9

The 0 298 10
Church 0 298 10
was 0 298 10
infiltrated, 0 298 10
we 0 298 10
know 0 298 10
this, 0 298 10
in 0 298 10
the 0 298 10
19th 0 298 10
century 0 298 10
by 0 298 10
some 0 298 10
pretty 0 298 10
dark 1 298 10
forces, 1 298 10
and 0 298 10
they 0 298 10
have 0 298 10
finally 0 298 10
come 0 298 10
into 0 298 10
the 0 298 10
ascendancy 0 298 10
and 0 298 10
are 0 298 10
showing 0 298 10
themselves 0 298 10
quite 0 298 10
clearly 0 298 10
for 0 298 10
what 0 298 10
they 0 298 10
are. 0 298 10

The 0 298 11
McCarrick 0 298 11

– 0 298 11
and 0 298 11
all 0 298 11
the 0 298 11
stuff 0 298 11
swirling 0 298 11
around 0 298 11
it 0 298 11
like 0 298 11
the 0 298 11

about 0 298 11

Pope 0 298 11
Francis 0 298 11
through 0 298 11
Cardinal 0 298 11
Maradiaga 0 298 11
– 0 298 11
has 0 298 11
not 0 298 11
come 0 298 11
in 0 298 11
contrast 0 298 11
to 0 298 11
this 0 298 11
but 0 298 11
as 0 298 11
an 0 298 11
intrinsic 0 298 11
part 0 298 11
of 0 298 11
it. 0 298 11

The 0 298 12
scandal 0 298 12
of 0 298 12
McCarrick 0 298 12
is 0 298 12
simply 0 298 12
a 0 298 12
toxic 1 298 12
emission, 0 298 12
a 0 298 12
venting 0 298 12
of 0 298 12
the 0 298 12
gasses 0 298 12
that 0 298 12
build 0 298 12
up 0 298 12
naturally 0 298 12
around 0 298 12
any 0 298 12
rotting 1 298 12
thing. 0 298 12

Rod 0 298 13
Dreher[1] 0 298 13
is 0 298 13
doing 0 298 13
excellent 0 298 13
work 0 298 13
compiling 0 298 13
testimony 0 298 13
from 0 298 13
priests 0 298 13
and 0 298 13
others 0 298 13
saying 0 298 13
out 0 298 13
loud 0 298 13
at 0 298 13
last 0 298 13
what 0 298 13
many 0 298 13
of 0 298 13
us 0 298 13
had 0 298 13
known 0 298 13
for 0 298 13
many 0 298 13
years 0 298 13
about 0 298 13
McCarrick 0 298 13
and 0 298 13
his 0 298 13
gang. 0 298 13

It 0 298 14
has 0 298 14
shown 0 298 14
the 0 298 14
world 0 298 14
what 0 298 14
Traditionalists 0 298 14
have 0 298 14
known, 0 298 14
that 0 298 14
it 0 298 14
is 0 298 14
emphatically 0 298 14
NOT 0 298 14
the 0 298 14
result 0 298 14
of 0 298 14
one 0 298 14
“bad 0 298 14
apple” 0 298 14
or 0 298 14
even 0 298 14
only 0 298 14
a 0 298 14
“few” 0 298 14
as 0 298 14
the 0 298 14
hapless 0 298 14
“conservative” 0 298 14
Bishop 0 298 14
Tobin 0 298 14
tried 0 298 14
to 0 298 14
claim 0 298 14
on 0 298 14
Twitter. 0 298 14

This 0 298 15
is 0 298 15
the 0 298 15
result 0 298 15
of 0 298 15
a 0 298 15
mass-collusion. 0 298 15

As 0 298 16
our 0 298 16
friend 0 298 16
Steve 0 298 16
Skojec 0 298 16
put 0 298 16
it 0 298 16
the 0 298 16
other 0 298 16
day, 0 298 16
“We’ve 0 298 16
got 0 298 16
to 0 298 16
stop 0 298 16
pretending 0 298 16
it’s 0 298 16
just 0 298 16
the 0 298 16
progressive 0 298 16
element 0 298 16
in 0 298 16
the 0 298 16
Church. 0 298 16

The 0 298 17
‘conservatives’ 0 298 17
are 0 298 17
complicit, 0 298 17
too.” 0 298 17
In 0 298 17
short, 0 298 17
as 0 298 17
it 0 298 17
was 0 298 17
during 0 298 17
his 0 298 17
days 0 298 17
of 0 298 17
glory, 0 298 17
globe 0 298 17
trotting 0 298 17
on 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
dime 0 298 17
of 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
State 0 298 17
Department, 0 298 17
hosting 0 298 17
presidents 0 298 17
for 0 298 17
dinner 0 298 17
and 0 298 17
inviting 0 298 17
John 0 298 17
Paul 0 298 17
II 0 298 17
and 0 298 17
Mother 0 298 17
Theresa 0 298 17
to 0 298 17
tea, 0 298 17
so 0 298 17
it 0 298 17
is 0 298 17
now: 0 298 17
McCarrick 0 298 17
is 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
face 0 298 17
of 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
New 0 298 17
Paradigm. 0 298 17

Whether 0 298 18
he 0 298 18
now 0 298 18
has 0 298 18
to 0 298 18
go 0 298 18
live 0 298 18
in 0 298 18
obscurity 0 298 18
in 0 298 18
some 0 298 18
beach 0 298 18
house 0 298 18
in 0 298 18
the 0 298 18
Caymans, 0 298 18
it 0 298 18
will 0 298 18
remain 0 298 18
true: 0 298 18
McCarrick 0 298 18
is 0 298 18
the 0 298 18
“New 0 298 18
Church.” 0 298 18

A 0 298 19
point 0 298 19
that 0 298 19
Dreher’s 0 298 19
informants 0 298 19
have 0 298 19
brought 0 298 19
up 0 298 19
needs 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
be 0 298 19
made 0 298 19
emphatic: 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
homosexualist 1 298 19
cabal 1 298 19
that 0 298 19
is 0 298 19
currently 0 298 19
reported 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
be 0 298 19
dominant 0 298 19
in 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
Catholic 0 298 19
hierarchy 0 298 19
(and 0 298 19
don’t 0 298 19
imagine 0 298 19
this 0 298 19
is 0 298 19
confined 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
United 0 298 19
States 0 298 19
or 0 298 19
even 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
English 0 298 19
speaking 0 298 19
world) 0 298 19
have 0 298 19
a 0 298 19
well 0 298 19
documented 0 298 19
methodology 0 298 19
of 0 298 19
mutual 0 298 19
protection-and-threat 0 298 19
that 0 298 19
keeps 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
whole 0 298 19
apparatus 0 298 19
afloat. 0 298 19

In 0 298 20
briefest 0 298 20
and 0 298 20
simplest 0 298 20
possible 0 298 20
terms, 0 298 20
immoral 0 298 20
or 0 298 20
even 0 298 20
illegal 0 298 20
sexual 0 298 20
activity 0 298 20
is 0 298 20
preferred 0 298 20
because 0 298 20
it 0 298 20
leaves 0 298 20
a 0 298 20
man 0 298 20
open 0 298 20
to 0 298 20
blackmail, 0 298 20
to 0 298 20
control 0 298 20
through 0 298 20
fear 0 298 20
of 0 298 20
exposure[2]. 0 298 20

When 0 298 21
that 0 298 21
blackmailing 0 298 21
culture 0 298 21
becomes 0 298 21
ascendant, 0 298 21
it 0 298 21
will 0 298 21
always 0 298 21
reject 0 298 21
the 0 298 21
morally 0 298 21
upright 0 298 21
as 0 298 21
too 0 298 21
dangerous, 0 298 21
too 0 298 21
difficult 0 298 21
to 0 298 21
control. 0 298 21

This 0 298 22
is 0 298 22
why 0 298 22
faithful 0 298 22
seminarians 0 298 22
are 0 298 22
rejected 0 298 22
and 0 298 22
why 0 298 22
faithful 0 298 22
priests 0 298 22
are 0 298 22
harassed. 0 298 22

As 0 298 23
Dreher 0 298 23
reported, 0 298 23

When 0 298 24
predatory 1 298 24
gay 1 298 24
priests 1 298 24
run 0 298 24
seminaries, 0 298 24
they 0 298 24
select 0 298 24
on 0 298 24
a 0 298 24
bias 0 298 24
for 0 298 24
gay 0 298 24
candidates... 0 298 24

Gay 0 298 25
seminarians 0 298 25
who 0 298 25
intend 0 298 25
to 0 298 25
be 0 298 25
celibate, 0 298 25
Sipe 0 298 25
said, 0 298 25
face 0 298 25
tremendous 0 298 25
pressure 0 298 25
to 0 298 25
have 0 298 25
sex. 0 298 25

If 0 298 26
they 0 298 26
slip 0 298 26
up 0 298 26
even 0 298 26
once, 0 298 26
their 0 298 26
failure 0 298 26
will 0 298 26
be 0 298 26
noted, 0 298 26
and 0 298 26
shared… 0 298 26
And 0 298 26
they 0 298 26
will 0 298 26
be 0 298 26
made 0 298 26
to 0 298 26
understand 0 298 26
that 0 298 26
their 0 298 26
lapse 0 298 26
is 0 298 26
remembered. 0 298 26

Later, 0 298 27
as 0 298 27
a 0 298 27
priest, 0 298 27
predators 0 298 27
within 0 298 27
the 0 298 27
priesthood 0 298 27
have 0 298 27
that 0 298 27
knowledge 0 298 27
to 0 298 27
hold 0 298 27
over 0 298 27
the 0 298 27
heads 0 298 27
of 0 298 27
other 0 298 27
gay 0 298 27
priests, 0 298 27
to 0 298 27
keep 0 298 27
them 0 298 27
silent 0 298 27
if 0 298 27
they 0 298 27
ever 0 298 27
have 0 298 27
the 0 298 27
desire 0 298 27
to 0 298 27
blow 0 298 27
whistles. 0 298 27

When 0 298 28
I 0 298 28
was 0 298 28
covering 0 298 28
the 0 298 28
scandal 0 298 28
in 0 298 28
the 0 298 28
early 0 298 28
2000s, 0 298 28
I 0 298 28
spoke 0 298 28
to 0 298 28
several, 0 298 28
unconnected 0 298 28
heterosexual 0 298 28
men 0 298 28
— 0 298 28
priests, 0 298 28
former 0 298 28
priests, 0 298 28
seminarians 0 298 28
— 0 298 28
who 0 298 28
said 0 298 28
that 0 298 28
gay 0 298 28
seminary 0 298 28
rectors 0 298 28
or 0 298 28
diocesan 0 298 28
officials 0 298 28
encouraged 0 298 28
them 0 298 28
to 0 298 28
take 0 298 28
female 0 298 28
sexual 0 298 28
partners, 0 298 28
so 0 298 28
that 0 298 28
they 0 298 28
too 0 298 28
would 0 298 28
be 0 298 28
complicit 0 298 28
in 0 298 28
sexual 0 298 28
secret-keeping, 0 298 28
and 0 298 28
therefore 0 298 28
no 0 298 28
longer 0 298 28
[be] 0 298 28
a 0 298 28
potential 0 298 28
danger. 0 298 28

Nothing 0 298 29
in 0 298 29
a 0 298 29
system 0 298 29
like 0 298 29
that 0 298 29
is 0 298 29
a 0 298 29
greater 0 298 29
threat 0 298 29
to 0 298 29
the 0 298 29
corrupt 0 298 29
than 0 298 29
men 0 298 29
who 0 298 29
are 0 298 29
not 0 298 29
corrupt. 0 298 29

For 0 298 30
many 0 298 30
priests, 0 298 30
one 0 298 30
might 0 298 30
say 0 298 30
all 0 298 30
good 0 298 30
priests, 0 298 30
this 0 298 30
is 0 298 30
not 0 298 30
a 0 298 30
sustainable 0 298 30
situation, 0 298 30
to 0 298 30
say 0 298 30
the 0 298 30
least. 0 298 30

I’ve 0 298 31
had 0 298 31
quite 0 298 31
a 0 298 31
few 0 298 31
conversations 0 298 31
with 0 298 31
priests 0 298 31
who 0 298 31
are 0 298 31
now 0 298 31
asking 0 298 31
how 0 298 31
to 0 298 31
deal 0 298 31
with 0 298 31
it. 0 298 31

How 0 298 32
are 0 298 32
they 0 298 32
to 0 298 32
continue 0 298 32
to 0 298 32
offer 0 298 32
the 0 298 32
sacraments 0 298 32
in 0 298 32
this 0 298 32
situation? 0 298 32

Where 0 298 33
are 0 298 33
they 0 298 33
to 0 298 33
live? 0 298 33

How 0 298 34
are 0 298 34
they 0 298 34
to 0 298 34
maintain 0 298 34
themselves? 0 298 34

These 0 298 35
are 0 298 35
the 0 298 35
priests 0 298 35
who 0 298 35
did 0 298 35
make 0 298 35
it 0 298 35
through 0 298 35
this 0 298 35
institutional 0 298 35
gauntlet, 0 298 35
who 0 298 35
remain 0 298 35
faithful 0 298 35
now 0 298 35
but 0 298 35
are 0 298 35
still 0 298 35
under 0 298 35
the 0 298 35
control 0 298 35
of 0 298 35
these 0 298 35
often 0 298 35
grossly 1 298 35
corrupt 1 298 35
and 1 298 35
evil 1 298 35
men. 1 298 35

As 0 298 36
men 0 298 36
known 0 298 36
to 0 298 36
be 0 298 36
incorruptible 0 298 36
themselves, 0 298 36
there 0 298 36
is 0 298 36
a 0 298 36
big 0 298 36
target 0 298 36
painted 0 298 36
on 0 298 36
their 0 298 36
backs. 0 298 36

In 0 298 37
short, 0 298 37
not 0 298 37
only 0 298 37
can 0 298 37
a 0 298 37
bad 0 298 37
bishop 0 298 37
harry 0 298 37
a 0 298 37
man 0 298 37
out 0 298 37
of 0 298 37
his 0 298 37
ministry, 0 298 37
he 0 298 37
has 0 298 37
complete 0 298 37
control 0 298 37
over 0 298 37
the 0 298 37
priest’s 0 298 37
material 0 298 37
life. 0 298 37

The 0 298 38
bishop 0 298 38
can, 0 298 38
with 0 298 38
the 0 298 38
flick 0 298 38
of 0 298 38
a 0 298 38
pen 0 298 38
or 0 298 38
a 0 298 38
single 0 298 38
phone 0 298 38
call, 0 298 38
render 0 298 38
a 0 298 38
priest 0 298 38
homeless, 0 298 38
penniless 0 298 38
and 0 298 38
jobless. 0 298 38

And 0 298 39
these, 0 298 39
remember, 0 298 39
are 0 298 39
men, 0 298 39
often 0 298 39
well 0 298 39
on 0 298 39
in 0 298 39
years, 0 298 39
whose 0 298 39
only 0 298 39
education 0 298 39
and 0 298 39
employment 0 298 39
training 0 298 39

degrees 0 298 39
in 0 298 39
philosophy 0 298 39
and 0 298 39
theology, 0 298 39
and 0 298 39
whose 0 298 39
only 0 298 39
professional 0 298 39
contacts 0 298 39
are 0 298 39
ecclesiastical. 0 298 39

Moreover, 0 298 40
because 0 298 40
of 0 298 40
the 0 298 40
globalisation 0 298 40
of 0 298 40
the 0 298 40
bishop-network, 0 298 40
a 0 298 40
man 0 298 40
blackballed 0 298 40
for 0 298 40
his 0 298 40
authentic 0 298 40
Catholicity 0 298 40
will 0 298 40
be 0 298 40
a 0 298 40
pariah 0 298 40
in 0 298 40
every 0 298 40
diocese 0 298 40
in 0 298 40
the 0 298 40
world. 0 298 40

And 0 298 41
with 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
advent 0 298 41
of 0 298 41
Bergoglio 0 298 41
in 0 298 41
Rome, 0 298 41
there 0 298 41
are 0 298 41
no 0 298 41
more 0 298 41
havens; 0 298 41
as 0 298 41
many 0 298 41
of 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
former 0 298 41
Franciscan 0 298 41
Friars 0 298 41
of 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
Immaculate 0 298 41

learned, 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
blackballing 0 298 41
has 0 298 41
gone 0 298 41
global 0 298 41
with 0 298 41
this 0 298 41
pontificate. 0 298 41

He 0 298 42
will 0 298 42
remain 0 298 42
a 0 298 42
pariah 0 298 42
even 0 298 42
among 0 298 42
the 0 298 42
so-called 0 298 42
“good” 0 298 42
bishops 0 298 42
who 0 298 42
live 0 298 42
in 0 298 42
terror 0 298 42
of 0 298 42
the 0 298 42
immense 0 298 42
power 0 298 42
of 0 298 42
the 0 298 42
cabal… 0 298 42
(see 0 298 42

& 0 298 42
President 0 298 42

I 0 298 43
have 0 298 43
been 0 298 43
hearing 0 298 43
from 0 298 43
priests 0 298 43
who 0 298 43
are 0 298 43
saying 0 298 43
in 0 298 43
effect, 0 298 43
“We’re 0 298 43
trapped 0 298 43
in 0 298 43
this 0 298 43
situation 0 298 43
and 0 298 43
forced 0 298 43
to 0 298 43
remain 0 298 43
silent 0 298 43
because 0 298 43
if 0 298 43
we 0 298 43
don’t 0 298 43
we’ll 0 298 43
not 0 298 43
only 0 298 43
be 0 298 43
unable 0 298 43
to 0 298 43
function 0 298 43
as 0 298 43
priests, 0 298 43
but 0 298 43
we’ll 0 298 43
be 0 298 43
homeless 0 298 43
and 0 298 43
penniless. 0 298 43

We’re 0 298 44
unemployable 0 298 44
in 0 298 44
any 0 298 44
other 0 298 44
field.” 0 298 44
And 0 298 44
as 0 298 44
much 0 298 44
as 0 298 44
we 0 298 44
might 0 298 44
be 0 298 44
tempted 0 298 44
to 0 298 44
say, 0 298 44
“Well 1 298 44
suck 1 298 44
it 1 298 44
up, 1 298 44
this 0 298 44
is 0 298 44
for 0 298 44
the 0 298 44
good 0 298 44
of 0 298 44
souls,” 0 298 44
the 0 298 44
reality 0 298 44
is 0 298 44
that 0 298 44
these 0 298 44
are 0 298 44
not 0 298 44
small 0 298 44
considerations. 0 298 44

Many 0 298 45
priests 0 298 45
are 0 298 45
getting 0 298 45
older 0 298 45
– 0 298 45
many 0 298 45
of 0 298 45
them 0 298 45
with 0 298 45
health 0 298 45
issues 0 298 45
– 0 298 45
and 0 298 45
a 0 298 45
man 0 298 45
who 0 298 45
has 0 298 45
already 0 298 45
given 0 298 45
20 0 298 45
or 0 298 45
30 0 298 45
years 0 298 45
of 0 298 45
his 0 298 45
life 0 298 45
to 0 298 45
the 0 298 45
Church 0 298 45
is 0 298 45
faced 0 298 45
with 0 298 45
a 0 298 45
practical 0 298 45
impossibility 0 298 45
if 0 298 45
he 0 298 45
finds 0 298 45
himself 0 298 45
blacklisted. 0 298 45

Of 0 298 46
course 0 298 46
there 0 298 46
are 0 298 46
some 0 298 46
who 0 298 46
don’t 0 298 46
fit 0 298 46
this 0 298 46
mould; 0 298 46
there 0 298 46
are 0 298 46
a 0 298 46
lot 0 298 46
of 0 298 46
second 0 298 46
careers 0 298 46
in 0 298 46
the 0 298 46
priesthood 0 298 46
and 0 298 46
plenty 0 298 46
of 0 298 46
people 0 298 46
go 0 298 46
into 0 298 46
seminary 0 298 46
after 0 298 46
some 0 298 46
years 0 298 46
in 0 298 46
the 0 298 46
normal 0 298 46
workforce 0 298 46
and 0 298 46
can 0 298 46
go 0 298 46
back 0 298 46
to 0 298 46
it 0 298 46
at 0 298 46
need. 0 298 46

Some 0 298 47
of 0 298 47
the 0 298 47
men 0 298 47
now 0 298 47
coming 0 298 47
forward 0 298 47
with 0 298 47
complaints 0 298 47
against 0 298 47
McCarrick, 0 298 47
who 0 298 47
left 0 298 47
the 0 298 47
priesthood 0 298 47
over 0 298 47
their 0 298 47
experiences, 0 298 47
have 0 298 47
gone 0 298 47
on 0 298 47
to 0 298 47
have 0 298 47
normal, 0 298 47
healthy 0 298 47
working 0 298 47
lives. 0 298 47

But 0 298 48
I 0 298 48
think 0 298 48
honestly 0 298 48
most 0 298 48
priests 0 298 48
are 0 298 48
in 0 298 48
this 0 298 48
corner 0 298 48
and 0 298 48
they 0 298 48
know 0 298 48
it 0 298 48
and 0 298 48
so 0 298 48
do 0 298 48
their 0 298 48
bishops. 0 298 48

I 0 298 49
think 0 298 49
a 0 298 49
young 0 298 49
man 0 298 49
goes 0 298 49
forward 0 298 49
in 0 298 49
great 0 298 49
faith, 0 298 49
spends 0 298 49
ten 0 298 49
to 0 298 49
fifteen 0 298 49
years 0 298 49
studying 0 298 49
philosophy 0 298 49
and 0 298 49
theology 0 298 49
- 0 298 49
fields 0 298 49
that 0 298 49
have 0 298 49
almost 0 298 49
no 0 298 49
application 0 298 49
in 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
workforce 0 298 49
outside 0 298 49
academia 0 298 49
or 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
Church 0 298 49
- 0 298 49
with 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
honest, 0 298 49
and 0 298 49
frankly 0 298 49
fair, 0 298 49
expectation 0 298 49
of 0 298 49
a 0 298 49
lifetime 0 298 49
of 0 298 49
employment 0 298 49
and 0 298 49
a 0 298 49
safety 0 298 49
net 0 298 49
at 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
end. 0 298 49

As 0 298 50
one 0 298 50
of 0 298 50
them 0 298 50
said 0 298 50
to 0 298 50
me, 0 298 50
“The 0 298 50
old 0 298 50
arrangement 0 298 50
was, 0 298 50
‘Remain 0 298 50
faithful, 0 298 50
do 0 298 50
the 0 298 50
work, 0 298 50
and 0 298 50
we 0 298 50
will 0 298 50
look 0 298 50
after 0 298 50
you. 0 298 50

We’ll 0 298 51
house, 0 298 51
feed 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
clothe 0 298 51
you 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
look 0 298 51
after 0 298 51
your 0 298 51
retirement.’ 0 298 51
The 0 298 51
new 0 298 51
arrangement 0 298 51
is 0 298 51
a 0 298 51
perversion 0 298 51
of 0 298 51
that: 0 298 51
‘Keep 0 298 51
quiet 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
go 0 298 51
along 0 298 51
with 0 298 51
it 0 298 51
all 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
you’ll 0 298 51
be 0 298 51
fine, 0 298 51
but 0 298 51
step 0 298 51
an 0 298 51
inch 0 298 51
out 0 298 51
of 0 298 51
line 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
we’ll 1 298 51
destroy 1 298 51
you.’” 1 298 51

So 0 298 52
what 0 298 52
do 0 298 52
we 0 298 52
do? 0 298 52

The 0 298 53
Old 0 298 53
Paradigm 0 298 53
is 0 298 53
destroyed 0 298 53
and 0 298 53
going 0 298 53
along 0 298 53
with 0 298 53
the 0 298 53
New 0 298 53
Paradigm 0 298 53
is 0 298 53
a 0 298 53
guarantee 0 298 53
of 0 298 53
destruction 0 298 53
for 0 298 53
yourself 0 298 53
and 0 298 53
everyone 0 298 53
else. 0 298 53

As 0 298 54
we 0 298 54
saw 0 298 54
in 0 298 54
Ireland 0 298 54
this 0 298 54
week, 0 298 54
the 0 298 54
Purge 0 298 54
has 0 298 54
started. 0 298 54

It’s 0 298 55
not 0 298 55
enough 0 298 55
to 0 298 55
simply 0 298 55
demand 0 298 55
that 0 298 55
a 0 298 55
priest 0 298 55
continue 0 298 55
in 0 298 55
his 0 298 55
ministry 0 298 55
no 0 298 55
matter 0 298 55
what. 0 298 55

We 0 298 56
need 0 298 56
to 0 298 56
start 0 298 56
working 0 298 56
together 0 298 56
with 0 298 56
faithful 0 298 56
priests 0 298 56
– 0 298 56
while 0 298 56
there 0 298 56
still 0 298 56
are 0 298 56
some 0 298 56
– 0 298 56
to 0 298 56
help 0 298 56
them 0 298 56
create 0 298 56
practical 0 298 56
material 0 298 56
alternatives. 0 298 56

If 0 298 57
we 0 298 57
who 0 298 57
still 0 298 57
love 0 298 57
the 0 298 57
Church 0 298 57
want 0 298 57
priests 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
be 0 298 57
faithful, 0 298 57
and 0 298 57
even 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
start 0 298 57
denouncing 0 298 57
the 0 298 57
evil 0 298 57
and 0 298 57
corruption 0 298 57
they 0 298 57
see, 0 298 57
we 0 298 57
are 0 298 57
going 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
have 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
help 0 298 57
them 0 298 57
create 0 298 57
a 0 298 57
modicum 0 298 57
of 0 298 57
independence 0 298 57
and 0 298 57
security 0 298 57
in 0 298 57
which 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
do 0 298 57
it. 0 298 57

The 0 298 58
other 0 298 58
day 0 298 58
the 0 298 58
American 0 298 58
conservative 0 298 58
writer, 0 298 58
John 0 298 58
Zmirak, 0 298 58
wrote 0 298 58
a 0 298 58
sound 0 298 58
suggestion 0 298 58
on 0 298 58
Twitter 0 298 58
that 0 298 58
I 0 298 58
think 0 298 58
it’s 0 298 58
time 0 298 58
we 0 298 58
all 0 298 58
started 0 298 58
taking 0 298 58
seriously. 0 298 58

In 0 298 59
response 0 298 59
to 0 298 59
the 0 298 59
continued 0 298 59
outrages 0 298 59
of 0 298 59
both 0 298 59
“good” 0 298 59
and 0 298 59
bad 0 298 59
bishops, 0 298 59
Zmirak 0 298 59
suggested 0 298 59
establishing 0 298 59
“an 0 298 59
escrow 0 298 59
fund 0 298 59
in 0 298 59
each 0 298 59
scandal-plagued 0 298 59
diocese, 0 298 59
where 0 298 59
laymen 0 298 59
[can] 0 298 59
deposit 0 298 59
the 0 298 59
funds 0 298 59
they 0 298 59
would 0 298 59
have 0 298 59
donated 0 298 59
to 0 298 59
[the] 0 298 59
local 0 298 59
church, 0 298 59
until 0 298 59
[a] 0 298 59
new 0 298 59
bishop 0 298 59
[is] 0 298 59
appointed.” 0 298 59

I 0 298 60
responded: 0 298 60
“And 0 298 60
the 0 298 60
money 0 298 60
could 0 298 60
be 0 298 60
used 0 298 60
to 0 298 60

for 0 298 60
refusing 0 298 60
the 0 298 60
New 0 298 60
Paradigm. 0 298 60

We 0 298 61
could 0 298 61
even 0 298 61
perhaps 0 298 61
buy 0 298 61
a 0 298 61
few 0 298 61

I 0 298 62
am 0 298 62
hearing 0 298 62
lately 0 298 62
from 0 298 62
laymen 0 298 62
who 0 298 62
are 0 298 62
starting 0 298 62
to 0 298 62
talk 0 298 62
about 0 298 62
setting 0 298 62
up 0 298 62
financial 0 298 62
structures 0 298 62
to 0 298 62
ensure 0 298 62
that 0 298 62
the 0 298 62
authentic 0 298 62
Catholic 0 298 62
life 0 298 62
can 0 298 62
be 0 298 62
maintained 0 298 62
through 0 298 62
what 0 298 62
is 0 298 62
obviously 0 298 62
soon 0 298 62
to 0 298 62
be 0 298 62
a 0 298 62
general 0 298 62
collapse 0 298 62
of 0 298 62
the 0 298 62
institution. 0 298 62

This 0 298 63
would 0 298 63
mean 0 298 63
independent 0 298 63
non-profit 0 298 63
foundations 0 298 63
that 0 298 63
could 0 298 63
build 0 298 63
or 0 298 63
buy 0 298 63
church 0 298 63
buildings, 0 298 63
convents 0 298 63
and 0 298 63
even 0 298 63
schools 0 298 63
and 0 298 63
provide 0 298 63
salaries 0 298 63
for 0 298 63
priests 0 298 63
and 0 298 63
other 0 298 63
staff. 0 298 63

I 0 298 64
started 0 298 64
thinking 0 298 64
about 0 298 64
this 0 298 64
recently 0 298 64
when 0 298 64
I 0 298 64
received 0 298 64
a 0 298 64
note 0 298 64
from 0 298 64
a 0 298 64
reader 0 298 64
with 0 298 64
a 0 298 64
link 0 298 64
to 0 298 64
an 0 298 64
online 0 298 64
petition 0 298 64
from 0 298 64
Germany, 0 298 64
addressed 0 298 64
to 0 298 64
the 0 298 64
German 0 298 64
bishops 0 298 64
[!!!] 0 298 64

“begging” 0 298 65
those 0 298 65
manifestly 1 298 65
evil 1 298 65
and 1 298 65
apostate 1 298 65
men 1 298 65
not 0 298 65
to 0 298 65
close 0 298 65
a 0 298 65
famous 0 298 65
and 0 298 65
ancient 0 298 65
monastic 0 298 65
house. 0 298 65

I 0 298 66
responded 0 298 66
that 0 298 66
this 0 298 66
was 0 298 66
going 0 298 66
about 0 298 66
things 0 298 66
the 0 298 66
wrong 0 298 66
way. 0 298 66

Catholics 0 298 67
are 0 298 67
going 0 298 67
to 0 298 67
have 0 298 67
to 0 298 67
get 0 298 67
their 0 298 67
heads 0 298 67
out 0 298 67
of 0 298 67
the 0 298 67
mindset 0 298 67
that 0 298 67
they 0 298 67
are 0 298 67
helpless 0 298 67
petitioners, 0 298 67
“begging” 0 298 67
the 0 298 67
hierarchy 0 298 67
to 0 298 67
maintain 0 298 67
the 0 298 67
Faith. 0 298 67

First 0 298 68
of 0 298 68
all, 0 298 68
it 0 298 68
only 0 298 68
gives 0 298 68
them 0 298 68
a 0 298 68
frisson 0 298 68
of 0 298 68
pleasure 0 298 68
to 0 298 68
see 0 298 68
us 0 298 68
groveling 0 298 68
and 0 298 68
begging 0 298 68
for 0 298 68
mercy. 0 298 68

Let’s 0 298 69
not 0 298 69
give 0 298 69
them 0 298 69
that, 0 298 69
OK? 0 298 69

There’s 0 298 70
already 0 298 70
enough 0 298 70
“frissons 0 298 70
of 0 298 70
pleasure” 0 298 70
in 0 298 70
their 0 298 70
lives. 0 298 70

Second, 0 298 71
it’s 0 298 71
simply 0 298 71
not 0 298 71
going 0 298 71
to 0 298 71
work. 0 298 71

In 0 298 72
Germany, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
US, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
Canada, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
Italy, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
Britain… 0 298 72
throughout 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
Church 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
1st 0 298 72
world, 0 298 72
and 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
much 0 298 72
of 0 298 72
it 0 298 72
elsewhere, 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
men 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
charge 0 298 72
of 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
“institutional 0 298 72
Church” 0 298 72
– 0 298 72
that 0 298 72
is, 0 298 72
whose 0 298 72
names 0 298 72
are 0 298 72
on 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
bank 0 298 72
accounts 0 298 72
– 0 298 72
are 0 298 72
dedicated 1 298 72
to 1 298 72
the 1 298 72
destruction 1 298 72
of 1 298 72
everything 1 298 72
we 1 298 72
want 1 298 72
to 1 298 72
preserve. 1 298 72

The 0 298 73
wolves 1 298 73
are 0 298 73
now 0 298 73
looking 0 298 73
with 0 298 73
ravening 0 298 73
eyes 0 298 73
at 0 298 73
the 0 298 73
faithful. 0 298 73

They 0 298 74
are, 0 298 74
in 0 298 74
short, 0 298 74
our 1 298 74
enemies. 1 298 74

They’ve 0 298 75
become 0 298 75
so 0 298 75
by 0 298 75
making 0 298 75
themselves 0 298 75
the 0 298 75
enemies 0 298 75
of 0 298 75
Christ 0 298 75
and 0 298 75
His 0 298 75
Holy 0 298 75
Church. 0 298 75

They 0 298 76
know 0 298 76
it 0 298 76
and 0 298 76
it’s 0 298 76
time 0 298 76
we 0 298 76
stopped 0 298 76
imagining 0 298 76
otherwise. 0 298 76

The 0 298 77
other 0 298 77
suggestion 0 298 77
I 0 298 77
have 0 298 77
is 0 298 77
for 0 298 77
young 0 298 77
men 0 298 77
interested 0 298 77
in 0 298 77
the 0 298 77
priesthood 0 298 77
to 0 298 77
fortify 0 298 77
themselves 0 298 77
not 0 298 77
only 0 298 77
spiritually 0 298 77
but 0 298 77
in 0 298 77
the 0 298 77
material 0 298 77
sphere. 0 298 77

There’s 0 298 78
one 0 298 78
big 0 298 78
vulnerability 0 298 78
we 0 298 78
can 0 298 78
guard 0 298 78
against 0 298 78
pretty 0 298 78
easily. 0 298 78

No 0 298 79
one 0 298 79
should 0 298 79
be 0 298 79
facing 0 298 79
penury 0 298 79
and 0 298 79
permanent 0 298 79
unemployment 0 298 79
because 0 298 79
he’s 0 298 79
a 0 298 79
faithful 0 298 79
Catholic. 0 298 79

We 0 298 80
should 0 298 80
never 0 298 80
be 0 298 80
letting 0 298 80
any 0 298 80
young 0 298 80
man 0 298 80
go 0 298 80
into 0 298 80
any 0 298 80
diocesan 0 298 80
seminary 0 298 80
without 0 298 80
being 0 298 80
a 0 298 80
property 0 298 80
owner. 0 298 80

He 0 298 81
should 0 298 81
own 0 298 81
a 0 298 81
house 0 298 81
or 0 298 81
stand 0 298 81
to 0 298 81
inherit 0 298 81
one. 0 298 81

Families 0 298 82
have 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
come 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
see 0 298 82
this 0 298 82
as 0 298 82
a 0 298 82
duty 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
the 0 298 82
child 0 298 82
and 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
the 0 298 82
Church. 0 298 82

And 0 298 83
more 0 298 83
than 0 298 83
that, 0 298 83
the 0 298 83
potential 0 298 83
priest 0 298 83
needs 0 298 83
to 0 298 83
have 0 298 83
job 0 298 83
skills 0 298 83
that 0 298 83
have 0 298 83
nothing 0 298 83
to 0 298 83
do 0 298 83
with 0 298 83
the 0 298 83
priesthood. 0 298 83

Among 0 298 84
the 0 298 84
working 0 298 84
classes 0 298 84
there 0 298 84
is 0 298 84
a 0 298 84
bias 0 298 84
against 0 298 84
intellectual 0 298 84
work. 0 298 84

But 0 298 85
most 0 298 85
working 0 298 85
class 0 298 85
people 0 298 85
have 0 298 85
a 0 298 85
pretty 0 298 85
sensible 0 298 85
attitude 0 298 85
towards 0 298 85
ambitions 0 298 85
in 0 298 85
academia: 0 298 85
get 0 298 85
something 0 298 85
under 0 298 85
your 0 298 85
belt 0 298 85
you 0 298 85
can 0 298 85
fall 0 298 85
back 0 298 85
on. 0 298 85

How 0 298 86
many 0 298 86
philosophy 0 298 86
PhDs 0 298 86
can 0 298 86
build 0 298 86
himself 0 298 86
a 0 298 86
bookshelf? 0 298 86

Change 0 298 87
the 0 298 87
oil 0 298 87
in 0 298 87
a 0 298 87
car? 0 298 87

Rewire 0 298 88
a 0 298 88
house? 0 298 88

The 0 298 89
standard 0 298 89
cliché 0 298 89
of 0 298 89
young 0 298 89
people 0 298 89
with 0 298 89
useless 0 298 89
academic 0 298 89
degrees 0 298 89
working 0 298 89
at 0 298 89
Starbucks 0 298 89
has 0 298 89
become 0 298 89
so 0 298 89
common 0 298 89
it’s 0 298 89
not 0 298 89
even 0 298 89
worth 0 298 89
memeing 0 298 89
anymore. 0 298 89

How 0 298 90
many 0 298 90
young 0 298 90
men 0 298 90
do 0 298 90
we 0 298 90
foresee 0 298 90
being 0 298 90
forced 0 298 90
out 0 298 90
of 0 298 90
seminary 0 298 90
for 0 298 90
having 0 298 90
the 0 298 90
wrong 0 298 90
“sexual 0 298 90
orientation”? 0 298 90

Every 0 298 91
one 0 298 91
of 0 298 91
those 0 298 91
guys 0 298 91
needs 0 298 91
to 0 298 91
be 0 298 91
able 0 298 91
to 0 298 91
snap 0 298 91
his 0 298 91
fingers 0 298 91
in 0 298 91
the 0 298 91
face 0 298 91
of 0 298 91
the 0 298 91
rector 0 298 91
and 0 298 91
walk 0 298 91
straight 0 298 91
into 0 298 91
a 0 298 91
decent 0 298 91
job, 0 298 91
based 0 298 91
not 0 298 91
on 0 298 91
any 0 298 91
recommendation 0 298 91
from 0 298 91
a 0 298 91
corrupt 0 298 91
bishop, 0 298 91
but 0 298 91
on 0 298 91
his 0 298 91
solid 0 298 91
skills. 0 298 91

Among 0 298 92
the 0 298 92
white 0 298 92
collar 0 298 92
classes 0 298 92
there 0 298 92
is 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
bias 0 298 92
against 0 298 92
blue 0 298 92
collar 0 298 92
work, 0 298 92
but 0 298 92
the 0 298 92
trades 0 298 92
are 0 298 92
crying 0 298 92
out 0 298 92
for 0 298 92
skilled 0 298 92
men 0 298 92
and 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
trade 0 298 92
school 0 298 92
diploma 0 298 92
in 0 298 92
fixing 0 298 92
tractors 0 298 92
is 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
lot 0 298 92
cheaper 0 298 92
and 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
lot 0 298 92
faster 0 298 92
to 0 298 92
get 0 298 92
than 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
university 0 298 92
degree. 0 298 92

That’s 0 298 93
an 0 298 93
economic 0 298 93
asset 0 298 93
that 0 298 93
we 0 298 93
can’t 0 298 93
afford 0 298 93
to 0 298 93
turn 0 298 93
up 0 298 93
our 0 298 93
well-educated 0 298 93
noses 0 298 93
at. 0 298 93

It 0 298 95
reminds 0 298 95
me 0 298 95
of 0 298 95
a 0 298 95
discussion 0 298 95
I 0 298 95
had 0 298 95
some 0 298 95
years 0 298 95
ago 0 298 95
with 0 298 95
the 0 298 95
prior 0 298 95
of 0 298 95
a 0 298 95
Benedictine 0 298 95
monastery 0 298 95
that 0 298 95
is 0 298 95
attracting 0 298 95
a 0 298 95
lot 0 298 95
of 0 298 95
young 0 298 95
vocations. 0 298 95

One 0 298 96
kid 0 298 96
wanted 0 298 96
to 0 298 96
join 0 298 96
and 0 298 96
told 0 298 96
me 0 298 96
they 0 298 96
had 0 298 96
recommended 0 298 96
he 0 298 96
go 0 298 96
to 0 298 96
some 0 298 96
college 0 298 96
or 0 298 96
other 0 298 96
to 0 298 96
study 0 298 96
philosophy 0 298 96
first. 0 298 96

This 0 298 97
college, 0 298 97
apparently, 0 298 97
waives 0 298 97
much 0 298 97
of 0 298 97
the 0 298 97
tuition 0 298 97
and 0 298 97
gives 0 298 97
work 0 298 97
studies 0 298 97
to 0 298 97
people 0 298 97
going 0 298 97
for 0 298 97
the 0 298 97
priesthood 0 298 97
and 0 298 97
religious 0 298 97
life 0 298 97
so 0 298 97
they 0 298 97
can 0 298 97
avoid 0 298 97
the 0 298 97
student 0 298 97
loan 0 298 97
trap. 0 298 97

This 0 298 98
is 0 298 98
fine, 0 298 98
good 0 298 98
idea. 0 298 98

But 0 298 99
I 0 298 99
asked 0 298 99
him 0 298 99
what 0 298 99
he 0 298 99
knew 0 298 99
how 0 298 99
to 0 298 99
do. 0 298 99

“Can 0 298 100
you 0 298 100
fix 0 298 100
a 0 298 100
bathroom 0 298 100
pipe? 0 298 100

Do 0 298 101
you 0 298 101
know 0 298 101
anything 0 298 101
about 0 298 101
what 0 298 101
to 0 298 101
feed 0 298 101
a 0 298 101
sheep 0 298 101
or 0 298 101
how 0 298 101
to 0 298 101
care 0 298 101
for 0 298 101
a 0 298 101
cow? 0 298 101

Can 0 298 102
you 0 298 102
drive 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
tractor?” 0 298 102
This 0 298 102
nice 0 298 102
kid, 0 298 102
who 0 298 102
certainly 0 298 102
does 0 298 102
have 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
vocation, 0 298 102
could 0 298 102
read 0 298 102
books 0 298 102
and 0 298 102
look 0 298 102
things 0 298 102
up 0 298 102
on 0 298 102
the 0 298 102
internet 0 298 102
and 0 298 102
write 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
pretty 0 298 102
mean 0 298 102
paper 0 298 102
on 0 298 102
Thomas 0 298 102
Aquinas, 0 298 102
but 0 298 102
not 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
lot 0 298 102
else. 0 298 102

There 0 298 103
is 0 298 103
going 0 298 103
to 0 298 103
have 0 298 103
to 0 298 103
be 0 298 103
a 0 298 103
shift 0 298 103
in 0 298 103
attitude 0 298 103
in 0 298 103
our 0 298 103
remaining 0 298 103
faithful 0 298 103
institutions. 0 298 103

Does 0 298 104
a 0 298 104
monastery 0 298 104
really 0 298 104
need 0 298 104
all 0 298 104
of 0 298 104
its 0 298 104
members 0 298 104
to 0 298 104
have 0 298 104
PhDs 0 298 104
in 0 298 104
philosophy 0 298 104
and 0 298 104
theology? 0 298 104

Wouldn’t 0 298 105
it 0 298 105
also 0 298 105
be 0 298 105
useful 0 298 105
to 0 298 105
have 0 298 105
an 0 298 105
electrician, 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
plumber, 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
carpenter, 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
cook, 0 298 105
someone 0 298 105
who 0 298 105
knows 0 298 105
how 0 298 105
to 0 298 105
fix 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
car 0 298 105
or 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
tractor? 0 298 105

Or 0 298 106
for 0 298 106
that 0 298 106
matter, 0 298 106
a 0 298 106
certified 0 298 106
accountant 0 298 106
or 0 298 106
an 0 298 106
investment 0 298 106
banker? 0 298 106

If 0 298 107
you 0 298 107
insist 0 298 107
on 0 298 107
having 0 298 107
people 0 298 107
with 0 298 107
degrees, 0 298 107
maybe 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
degree 0 298 107
in 0 298 107
agriculture 0 298 107
would 0 298 107
be 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
good 0 298 107
fit 0 298 107
for 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
big 0 298 107
monastic 0 298 107
foundation 0 298 107
with 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
lot 0 298 107
of 0 298 107
land 0 298 107
like, 0 298 107
say, 0 298 107
Clear 0 298 107
Creek 0 298 107
or 0 298 107
that 0 298 107
new 0 298 107
Carmelite 0 298 107
place 0 298 107
in 0 298 107
Nebraska. 0 298 107

I 0 298 108
think 0 298 108
this 0 298 108
is 0 298 108
the 0 298 108
time 0 298 108
we 0 298 108
are 0 298 108
going 0 298 108
to 0 298 108
have 0 298 108
to 0 298 108
start 0 298 108
overcoming 0 298 108
our 0 298 108
class 0 298 108
snobbery. 0 298 108

Young 0 298 109
men 0 298 109
with 0 298 109
ambitions 0 298 109
for 0 298 109
the 0 298 109
priesthood 0 298 109
are 0 298 109
going 0 298 109
to 0 298 109
have 0 298 109
to 0 298 109
tuck 0 298 109
away 0 298 109
employability 0 298 109
and 0 298 109
an 0 298 109
independent 0 298 109
financial 0 298 109
foundation, 0 298 109
in 0 298 109
the 0 298 109
same 0 298 109
way 0 298 109
people 0 298 109
used 0 298 109
to 0 298 109
tuck 0 298 109
money 0 298 109
away 0 298 109
against 0 298 109
a 0 298 109
rainy 0 298 109
day. 0 298 109

Simply 0 298 110
put, 0 298 110
they’ve 0 298 110
got 0 298 110
to 0 298 110
stop 0 298 110
being 0 298 110
materially 0 298 110
dependent 0 298 110
on 0 298 110
the 0 298 110
hierarchy. 0 298 110

This 0 298 111
vulnerability 0 298 111
is 0 298 111
a 0 298 111
gun 0 298 111
to 0 298 111
their 0 298 111
heads 0 298 111
in 0 298 111
this 0 298 111
time. 0 298 111

The 0 298 112
next 0 298 112
kid 0 298 112
who 0 298 112
says 0 298 112
anything 0 298 112
to 0 298 112
me 0 298 112
about 0 298 112
wanting 0 298 112
to 0 298 112
enter 0 298 112
the 0 298 112
diocesan 0 298 112
priesthood, 0 298 112
I’m 0 298 112
going 0 298 112
to 0 298 112
ask, 0 298 112
“How 0 298 112
sound 0 298 112
is 0 298 112
your 0 298 112
investment 0 298 112
portfolio?” 0 298 112
The 0 298 112
next 0 298 112
candidate 0 298 112
for 0 298 112
religious 0 298 112
life, 0 298 112
I’ll 0 298 112
ask, 0 298 112
“Great! 0 298 112

What’s 0 298 113
your 0 298 113
trade? 0 298 113

What 0 298 114
do 0 298 114
you 0 298 114
have 0 298 114
to 0 298 114
fall 0 298 114
back 0 298 114
on?” 0 298 114

I’m 0 298 115
given 0 298 115
to 0 298 115
understand 0 298 115
that 0 298 115
some 0 298 115
houses 0 298 115
of 0 298 115
the 0 298 115
Congregation 0 298 115
of 0 298 115
the 0 298 115
Oratory 0 298 115
ask 0 298 115
candidates 0 298 115
to 0 298 115
come 0 298 115
with 0 298 115
an 0 298 115
independent 0 298 115
income, 0 298 115
which, 0 298 115
given 0 298 115
what 0 298 115
we’re 0 298 115
seeing 0 298 115
elsewhere 0 298 115
doesn’t 0 298 115
sound 0 298 115
like 0 298 115
a 0 298 115
bad 0 298 115
idea. 0 298 115

Perhaps 0 298 116
Catholic 0 298 116
financial 0 298 116
advisors 0 298 116
could 0 298 116
be 0 298 116
encouraged 0 298 116
to 0 298 116
set 0 298 116
up 0 298 116
a 0 298 116
programme 0 298 116
to 0 298 116
teach 0 298 116
young 0 298 116
men 0 298 116
how 0 298 116
to 0 298 116
create 0 298 116
a 0 298 116
sound 0 298 116
financial 0 298 116
footing 0 298 116
with 0 298 116
investments. 0 298 116

Meanwhile, 0 298 117
we 0 298 117
must 0 298 117
refocus 0 298 117
our 0 298 117
energy 0 298 117
on 0 298 117
the 0 298 117
Faith 0 298 117
itself, 0 298 117
instead 0 298 117
of 0 298 117
the 0 298 117
physical 0 298 117
and 0 298 117
even 0 298 117
canonical 0 298 117
structures 0 298 117
that 0 298 117
house 0 298 117
it. 0 298 117

That 0 298 118
monastery 0 298 118
in 0 298 118
Germany 0 298 118
is 0 298 118
lost. 0 298 118

Those 0 298 119
bishops 0 298 119
want 0 298 119
the 0 298 119
property 0 298 119
and 0 298 119
they’ll 0 298 119
get 0 298 119
it. 0 298 119

What 0 298 120
the 0 298 120
group 0 298 120
of 0 298 120
laymen 0 298 120
should 0 298 120
be 0 298 120
doing, 0 298 120
instead 0 298 120
of 0 298 120
petitioning 0 298 120
that 0 298 120
it 0 298 120
be 0 298 120
saved, 0 298 120
is 0 298 120
finding 0 298 120
a 0 298 120
place 0 298 120
where 0 298 120
the 0 298 120
nuns 0 298 120
can 0 298 120
live 0 298 120
their 0 298 120
charism 0 298 120
of 0 298 120
religious 0 298 120
life 0 298 120
without 0 298 120
episcopal 0 298 120
harassment. 0 298 120

Bishops 0 298 121
won’t 0 298 121
protect 0 298 121
and 0 298 121
support 0 298 121
good 0 298 121
priests? 0 298 121

Then 1 298 122
it’s 1 298 122
up 1 298 122
to 1 298 122
us. 1 298 122

The 0 298 123
Vatican 0 298 123
wants 0 298 123
to 0 298 123
force 0 298 123
all 0 298 123
religious 0 298 123
congregations 0 298 123
into 0 298 123
the 0 298 123
pants-wearing, 0 298 123
Marxist 0 298 123
anti-nun, 0 298 123
LCWR 0 298 123
pattern? 0 298 123

We’re 0 298 124
not 0 298 124
helpless. 0 298 124

We 0 298 125
start 0 298 125
buying 0 298 125
convent 0 298 125
buildings 0 298 125
and 0 298 125
start 0 298 125
a 0 298 125
fund 0 298 125
to 0 298 125
support 0 298 125
the 0 298 125
nun-refugees. 0 298 125

Our 0 298 126
goal 0 298 126
must 0 298 126
be 0 298 126
preserving 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
precious 0 298 126
treasure, 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
Deposit 0 298 126
of 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
Faith, 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
sacramental 0 298 126
life, 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
great 0 298 126
charisms 0 298 126
and 0 298 126
artifacts 0 298 126
of 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
religious 0 298 126
life. 0 298 126

I 0 298 127
am 0 298 127
reminded 0 298 127
of 0 298 127
what 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
curators 0 298 127
of 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
Hermitage 0 298 127
Museum 0 298 127
in 0 298 127
St. 0 298 127
Petersburg 0 298 127
did 0 298 127
in 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
face 0 298 127
of 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
advancing 0 298 127
German 0 298 127
army. 0 298 127

They 0 298 128
took 0 298 128
down, 0 298 128
packed 0 298 128
up 0 298 128
and 0 298 128
hid 0 298 128
the 0 298 128
art 0 298 128
treasures, 0 298 128
some 0 298 128
of 0 298 128
the 0 298 128
greatest 0 298 128
in 0 298 128
the 0 298 128
world. 0 298 128

Over 0 298 129
a 0 298 129
million 0 298 129
precious 0 298 129
works 0 298 129
of 0 298 129
art 0 298 129
were 0 298 129
sent 0 298 129
on 0 298 129
trains 0 298 129
to 0 298 129
be 0 298 129
hidden 0 298 129
in 0 298 129
the 0 298 129
Urals. 0 298 129

Two 0 298 130
trains 0 298 130
got 0 298 130
away 0 298 130
to 0 298 130
safety, 0 298 130
but 0 298 130
one 0 298 130
was 0 298 130
still 0 298 130
there 0 298 130
when 0 298 130
the 0 298 130
Germans 0 298 130
surrounded 0 298 130
the 0 298 130
city 0 298 130
and 0 298 130
began 0 298 130
the 0 298 130
siege. 0 298 130

The 0 298 131
museum’s 0 298 131
website 0 298 131
tells 0 298 131
us: 0 298 131

“Despite 0 298 132
starvation 0 298 132
and 0 298 132
severely 0 298 132
cold 0 298 132
temperatures, 0 298 132
the 0 298 132
Museum 0 298 132
continued 0 298 132
its 0 298 132
preservational 0 298 132
functions. 0 298 132

With 0 298 133
only 0 298 133
a 0 298 133
skeleton 0 298 133
staff 0 298 133
left 0 298 133
behind, 0 298 133
it 0 298 133
was 0 298 133
difficult 0 298 133
to 0 298 133
protect 0 298 133
the 0 298 133
vast 0 298 133
buildings 0 298 133
and 0 298 133
their 0 298 133
sumptuous 0 298 133
interiors 0 298 133
against 0 298 133

had 0 298 137

They 0 298 138
understood 0 298 138
the 0 298 138
value 0 298 138
of 0 298 138

Does 0 298 139
this 0 298 139
all 0 298 139
sound 0 298 139
a 0 298 139
bit, 0 298 139
well, 0 298 139
schismatic? 0 298 139

Not 0 298 140
necessarily. 0 298 140

Any 0 298 141
bishop 0 298 141
who 0 298 141
can 0 298 141
demonstrate 0 298 141
through 0 298 141
his 0 298 141
actions 0 298 141
and 0 298 141
not 0 298 141
just 0 298 141
with 0 298 141
his 0 298 141
tweets, 0 298 141
who 0 298 141
can 0 298 141
prove 0 298 141
that 0 298 141
he 0 298 141
is 0 298 141
still 0 298 141
a 0 298 141
Catholic 0 298 141
and 0 298 141
not 0 298 141
a 0 298 141
wolf, 1 298 141
is 0 298 141
welcome 0 298 141
to 0 298 141
join 0 298 141
us. 0 298 141

But 0 298 142
we’d 0 298 142
be 0 298 142
fools 0 298 142
to 0 298 142
wait 0 298 142
for 0 298 142
them. 0 298 142

Whatever 0 298 143
you 0 298 143
might 0 298 143
think 0 298 143
of 0 298 143
Archbishop 0 298 143
Lefebvre’s 0 298 143
solution 0 298 143
over 0 298 143
the 0 298 143
last 0 298 143
few 0 298 143
decades, 0 298 143
it 0 298 143
certainly 0 298 143
seems 0 298 143
inarguable 0 298 143
that 0 298 143
the 0 298 143
“state 0 298 143
of 0 298 143
emergency” 0 298 143
for 0 298 143
which 0 298 143
he 0 298 143
was 0 298 143
preparing 0 298 143
has 0 298 143
come 0 298 143
at 0 298 143
last. 0 298 143

And 0 298 144
in 0 298 144
a 0 298 144
state 0 298 144
of 0 298 144
emergency, 0 298 144
certain 0 298 144
norms 0 298 144
are 0 298 144
naturally 0 298 144
suspended. 0 298 144

The 0 298 145
simple 0 298 145
fact 0 298 145
is 0 298 145
that 0 298 145
soon 0 298 145
there 0 298 145
are 0 298 145
going 0 298 145
to 0 298 145
be 0 298 145
“vagus” 0 298 145
priests 0 298 145
who 0 298 145
have 0 298 145
been 0 298 145
thrown 0 298 145
out 0 298 145
of 0 298 145
their 0 298 145
ministry 0 298 145
for 0 298 145
maintaining 0 298 145
the 0 298 145
Faith. 0 298 145

There 0 298 146
are 0 298 146
going 0 298 146
to 0 298 146
be 0 298 146
nuns 0 298 146
and 0 298 146
monks 0 298 146
without 0 298 146
homes, 0 298 146
as 0 298 146
in 0 298 146
the 0 298 146
England 0 298 146
of 0 298 146
Henry 0 298 146
VIII. 0 298 146

I 0 298 147
think 0 298 147
it’s 0 298 147
only 0 298 147
reasonable 0 298 147
that 0 298 147
those 0 298 147
who 0 298 147
also 0 298 147
want 0 298 147
to 0 298 147
maintain 0 298 147
the 0 298 147
Faith 0 298 147
should 0 298 147
reach 0 298 147
out 0 298 147
to 0 298 147
them 0 298 147
and 0 298 147
offer 0 298 147
what 0 298 147
shelter 0 298 147
we 0 298 147
can. 0 298 147

What 0 298 148
we 0 298 148
have 0 298 148
seen 0 298 148
this 0 298 148
week 0 298 148
is 0 298 148
making 0 298 148
it 0 298 148
clear 0 298 148
that 0 298 148
we 0 298 148
can 0 298 148
simply 0 298 148
no 0 298 148
longer 0 298 148
sit 0 298 148
back 0 298 148
and 0 298 148
“beg” 0 298 148
bishops 0 298 148
to 0 298 148
maintain 0 298 148
and 0 298 148
defend 0 298 148
the 0 298 148
Faith. 0 298 148

It’s 0 298 149
not 0 298 149
enough 0 298 149
now 0 298 149
to 0 298 149
go 0 298 149
into 0 298 149
seminary 0 298 149
or 0 298 149
a 0 298 149
monastery 0 298 149
with 0 298 149
glowing 0 298 149
eyes 0 298 149
and 0 298 149
a 0 298 149
firm 0 298 149
faith. 0 298 149

Sentiment 0 298 150
isn’t 0 298 150
going 0 298 150
to 0 298 150
be 0 298 150
much 0 298 150
comfort 0 298 150
when 0 298 150
the 0 298 150
young 0 298 150
man 0 298 150
is 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
longer 0 298 150
so 0 298 150
very 0 298 150
young 0 298 150
and 0 298 150
finds 0 298 150
himself 0 298 150
standing 0 298 150
on 0 298 150
the 0 298 150
street 0 298 150
outside 0 298 150
the 0 298 150
chancery 0 298 150
with 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
skills, 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
money, 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
job, 0 298 150
(no 0 298 150
health 0 298 150
insurance) 0 298 150
and 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
prospects. 0 298 150

If 0 298 151
it 0 298 151
is 0 298 151
true 0 298 151
that 0 298 151
we 0 298 151
really 0 298 151
are 0 298 151
alone 0 298 151
in 0 298 151
this, 0 298 151
then 1 298 151
so 1 298 151
be 1 298 151
it. 1 298 151

Let’s 0 298 152
stop 0 298 152
lamenting 0 298 152
and 0 298 152
start 0 298 152
doing 0 298 152
practical 0 298 152
things 0 298 152
about 0 298 152
it. 0 298 152

be 0 298 155
noted 0 298 155

up 0 298 155

Farrell, 0 298 159
who 0 298 159
ordained 0 298 159
20 0 298 159
new 0 298 159
priests 0 298 159
to 0 298 159
the 0 298 159
questionable-but-officially-reformed 0 298 159
community 0 298 159
in 0 298 159
2015. 0 298 159

A 0 298 160
recent 0 298 160
post 0 298 160
to 0 298 160
the 0 298 160
official 0 298 160
Regnum 0 298 160
Christi 0 298 160
website 0 298 160
shows 0 298 160
that 0 298 160
Cardinal 0 298 160
Kevin 0 298 160
is 0 298 160
still 0 298 160
close 0 298 160
enough 0 298 160
to 0 298 160
the 0 298 160
Legion-related 0 298 160
“lay” 0 298 160
organisation 0 298 160
to 0 298 160
hire 0 298 160
dicastery 0 298 160
staff 0 298 160
from 0 298 160
their 0 298 160
ranks. 0 298 160

After 0 298 161
he 0 298 161
left 0 298 161
the 0 298 161
Legion, 0 298 161
Kevin 0 298 161
Farrell 0 298 161
joined 0 298 161
the 0 298 161
diocesan 0 298 161
clergy 0 298 161
in 0 298 161
Washington 0 298 161
DC 0 298 161
and 0 298 161
became 0 298 161
a 0 298 161
protégé 0 298 161
of 0 298 161
the 0 298 161
archbishop, 0 298 161
Cardinal 0 298 161
Wuerl. 0 298 161

So 0 298 162
close 0 298 162
is 0 298 162
he 0 298 162
to 0 298 162
McCarrick 0 298 162
that 0 298 162
Farrell’s 0 298 162
coat 0 298 162
of 0 298 162
arms, 0 298 162
as 0 298 162
Elizabeth 0 298 162
Yore 0 298 162
reported 0 298 162
in 0 298 162
these 0 298 162
pages, 0 298 162
is 0 298 162
not 0 298 162
much 0 298 162
more 0 298 162
than 0 298 162
a 0 298 162
tribute 0 298 162
to 0 298 162
his 0 298 162
belatedly-disgraced 0 298 162
mentor. 0 298 162

So, 0 298 163
someone 0 298 163
in 0 298 163
a 0 298 163
journalistic 0 298 163
capacity 0 298 163
might 0 298 163
want 0 298 163
to 0 298 163
be 0 298 163
asking 0 298 163
a 0 298 163
few 0 298 163
questions 0 298 163
about 0 298 163
these 0 298 163
things 0 298 163
too. 0 298 163

[2] 0 298 164
It 0 298 164
should 0 298 164
also 0 298 164
be 0 298 164
noted 0 298 164
that 0 298 164
in 0 298 164
his 0 298 164
book, 0 298 164
The 0 298 164

Pope, 0 298 164
historian 0 298 164
Henry 0 298 164
Sire 0 298 164
documented 0 298 164
that 0 298 164
this 0 298 164
is 0 298 164
how 0 298 164
Jorge 0 298 164
Bergoglio 0 298 164
has 0 298 164
always 0 298 164

collecting 0 298 164
bad 0 298 164
men 0 298 164
around 0 298 164
him 0 298 164
and 0 298 164
controlling 0 298 164
them 0 298 164
with 0 298 164
a 0 298 164
masterful 0 298 164
combination 0 298 164
of 0 298 164
threats 0 298 164
and 0 298 164
rewards. 0 298 164

The 0 298 164

natural 0 298 164

question, 0 298 164

“Why 0 298 164

does 0 298 164

is 0 298 164

now 0 298 164

" 0 299 4

It 0 299 5
can't 0 299 5
be 0 299 5
a 0 299 5
case 0 299 5
of 0 299 5
Muslim 0 299 5
Judeophobia. 0 299 5

(That 0 299 6
would 0 299 6

And 0 299 7
since 0 299 7
we're 0 299 7
in 0 299 7
Europe, 0 299 7
it's 0 299 7

okay. 0 299 10

Getting 0 299 11
really 1 299 11
excited 1 299 11
about 0 299 11

among 0 299 11

even 0 299 12
though 0 299 12

defense 0 299 12
did 0 299 12
not 0 299 12
request 0 299 12
it. 0 299 12

The 0 299 13
suspect, 0 299 13
Traore 0 299 13

a 0 299 13
third 0 299 13

his 0 299 13
ability 0 299 13
to 0 299 13
stand 0 299 13

from 0 299 14
the 0 299 14
window 0 299 14
of 0 299 14

third-story 0 299 14
apartment. 0 299 14

They're 1 299 15
all 1 299 15
crazy 1 299 15
in 1 299 15
Europe. 1 299 15

A 0 299 16
Muslim 0 299 16
terrorist 0 299 16
stabbed 0 299 16
four 0 299 16
people 0 299 16
at 0 299 16
a 0 299 16
train 0 299 16
station 0 299 16
near 0 299 16
Munich 0 299 16
while 0 299 16
screaming, 0 299 16
“Allahu 1 299 16
Akbar”. 1 299 16

In 0 299 17
between 0 299 17
proclaiming 0 299 17
the 0 299 17
glory 0 299 17
of 0 299 17
Allah, 0 299 17
he 0 299 17
also 0 299 17
shouted 0 299 17
that 0 299 17
his 0 299 17
victims 0 299 17
were 0 299 17
all 0 299 17
“unbelievers”. 1 299 17

A 0 299 18
woman 0 299 18
heard 0 299 18
him 0 299 18
say, 0 299 18
“Infidel, 1 299 18
you 1 299 18
must 1 299 18
die”. 1 299 18

The 0 299 19
German 0 299 19
authorities 0 299 19
came 0 299 19
to 0 299 19
the 0 299 19
inescapable 0 299 19
conclusion 0 299 19
that 0 299 19
the 0 299 19
attack 0 299 19
had 0 299 19
nothing 0 299 19
to 0 299 19
do 0 299 19
with 0 299 19
Islam. 0 299 19

Instead 0 299 20
the 0 299 20
Muslim 0 299 20
terrorist 0 299 20
had 0 299 20
been 0 299 20
“mentally 1 299 20
ill” 1 299 20
and 0 299 20
was 0 299 20
probably 0 299 20
not 0 299 20
even 0 299 20
fit 0 299 20
to 0 299 20
stand 0 299 20
trial. 0 299 20

And 0 299 21
in 0 299 21
Russia. 0 299 21

Gyulchekhra 0 299 22
Bobokulova 0 299 22
beheaded 1 299 22
a 0 299 22
4-year-old 0 299 22
girl 0 299 22
and 0 299 22
displayed 0 299 22
her 0 299 22
head 0 299 22
in 0 299 22
the 0 299 22
street 0 299 22
while 0 299 22
shouting, 0 299 22
“Allahu 1 299 22
Akbar. 1 299 22

I 0 299 23
hate 0 299 23

I 0 299 24

I 0 299 25
want 0 299 25
you 0 299 25
dead.” 0 299 25
Faced 0 299 25
with 0 299 25
these 0 299 25
bafflingly 0 299 25
inscrutable 0 299 25
statements, 0 299 25
the 0 299 25
authorities 0 299 25
blamed 0 299 25
mental 1 299 25
illness. 1 299 25

And 0 299 26
Amsterdam. 0 299 26

In 0 299 27
May, 0 299 27
Malek, 0 299 27

three 0 299 27

in 0 299 27
The 0 299 27
Hague 0 299 27
while 0 299 27
shouting, 0 299 27
“Allahu 1 299 27
Akbar.” 1 299 27
The 0 299 27
Syrian 0 299 27
had 0 299 27
previously 0 299 27
thanked 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
Dutch 0 299 27
people 0 299 27
for 0 299 27
their 0 299 27
hospitality 0 299 27
by 0 299 27
shouting, 0 299 27
“Allahu 1 299 27
Akbar,” 1 299 27
and 0 299 27
throwing 0 299 27
pieces 0 299 27
of 0 299 27

out 0 299 27
of 0 299 27

into 0 299 27
the 0 299 27

On 0 299 28
the 0 299 28

Malek 0 299 28
cut 0 299 28
a 0 299 28
man’s 0 299 28
throat. 0 299 28

He 0 299 29
also 0 299 29
stabbed 0 299 29
two 0 299 29
others. 0 299 29

Police 0 299 30
shot 0 299 30
him 0 299 30

the 0 299 30

flag, 0 299 31
went 0 299 31
up 0 299 31
to 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
Jewish 0 299 31
restaurant 0 299 31
in 0 299 31
Amsterdam, 0 299 31
shouted 0 299 31
“Allahu 1 299 31
Akbar” 1 299 31
and 0 299 31
began 0 299 31
smashing 0 299 31
the 0 299 31
windows. 0 299 31

The 0 299 32
police 0 299 32
stood 0 299 32
by 0 299 32
and 0 299 32
watched 0 299 32
until 0 299 32
he 0 299 32
was 0 299 32
done. 0 299 32

And 0 299 33
then 0 299 33
they 0 299 33
arrested 0 299 33
him. 0 299 33

Ali 0 299 34
admitted 0 299 34
to 0 299 34
having 0 299 34
fought 0 299 34
with 0 299 34
Jihadists 0 299 34
in 0 299 34
Syria. 0 299 34

So 0 299 35
the 0 299 35
system 0 299 35
decided 0 299 35
that 0 299 35
he 0 299 35
needed 0 299 35
a 0 299 35
psychiatric 0 299 35
evaluation 0 299 35

Maybe 0 299 36
it's 0 299 36
not 0 299 36
the 0 299 36
terrorists 0 299 36
who 0 299 36
are 0 299 36
nuts. 1 299 36

Maybe 1 299 36

it's 1 299 36

the 1 299 36

authorities 1 299 36

who 1 299 36

are 1 299 36

insane. 1 299 36

Obama 0 300 0

This 0 300 1
is 0 300 1
just 0 300 1
silly. 1 300 1

The 0 300 2
constant 0 300 2
hand-wringing, 0 300 2
from 0 300 2
the 0 300 2
left-wing 0 300 2

over 0 300 2
President 0 300 2
Trump’s 0 300 2

and 0 300 2
his 0 300 2
connection 0 300 2
with 0 300 2
Russia 0 300 2
is 0 300 2
just 0 300 2
silly. 1 300 2

The 0 300 3
media 0 300 3
has 0 300 3
been 0 300 3
hanging 0 300 3
on 0 300 3
every 0 300 3
word 0 300 3
the 0 300 3
President 0 300 3
says 0 300 3
and 0 300 3
arguing 0 300 3
that 0 300 3
his 0 300 3
rhetoric 0 300 3
is 0 300 3
proof 0 300 3
positive 0 300 3
that 0 300 3
he 0 300 3
is 0 300 3
some 0 300 3
kind 0 300 3
of 0 300 3
Russian 0 300 3

that 0 300 5
the 0 300 5
President 0 300 5

Instead, 0 300 21
President 0 300 21
Trump’s 0 300 21
POLICIES 1 300 21
have 0 300 21
actually 0 300 21
made 0 300 21
life 0 300 21
more 0 300 21
difficult 0 300 21
for 0 300 21
Putin 0 300 21
at 0 300 21
every 0 300 21
turn. 0 300 21

Here’s 0 300 22
The 0 300 22
Federalist’s 0 300 22
Mollie 0 300 22
Hemingway 0 300 22
explaining: 0 300 22

Our 0 300 23
relationship 0 300 23
with 0 300 23
Russia 0 300 23
is 0 300 23
at 0 300 23
a 0 300 23
significant 0 300 23
low 0 300 23
point 0 300 23
where 0 300 23
just 0 300 23
having 0 300 23
some 0 300 23
conversations 0 300 23
can 0 300 23
lead 0 300 23
us 0 300 23
to 0 300 23
a 0 300 23
better 0 300 23
outcome. 0 300 23

And 0 300 24
there 0 300 24
are 0 300 24
so 0 300 24
many 0 300 24
important 0 300 24
things 0 300 24
that 0 300 24
they 0 300 24
are 0 300 24
involved 0 300 24
with 0 300 24
that 0 300 24
we 0 300 24
care 0 300 24
about, 0 300 24
whether 0 300 24
it’s 0 300 24
Syria, 0 300 24
Ukraine, 0 300 24
North 0 300 24
Korea 0 300 24
or 0 300 24
nuclear 0 300 24
arms. 0 300 24

I’m 0 300 25
kind 0 300 25
of 0 300 25
surprised 0 300 25
there’s 0 300 25
been 0 300 25
this 0 300 25
much 0 300 25
angst 0 300 25
over 0 300 25
this 0 300 25
press 0 300 25
conference. 0 300 25

Not 0 300 26
that 0 300 26
he 0 300 26
said 0 300 26
things 0 300 26
the 0 300 26
way 0 300 26
he 0 300 26
should 0 300 26
have. 0 300 26

President 0 300 27
Trump 0 300 27
really 0 300 27
did 0 300 27
mess 0 300 27
up 0 300 27
with 0 300 27
that 0 300 27
press 0 300 27
conference 0 300 27
but 0 300 27
I 0 300 27
don’t 0 300 27
quite 0 300 27
know 0 300 27
what 0 300 27
people 0 300 27
want. 0 300 27

He 0 300 28
actually 0 300 28
is 0 300 28
pretty 0 300 28
tough 1 300 28
on 0 300 28
Russia. 0 300 28

And 0 300 29
in 0 300 29
the 0 300 29
last 0 300 29
couple 0 300 29
of 0 300 29
years, 0 300 29
we’ve 0 300 29
seen 0 300 29
an 0 300 29
increase 0 300 29
in 0 300 29
the 0 300 29
military 0 300 29
budget, 0 300 29
we’ve 0 300 29
seen 0 300 29
an 0 300 29
increase 0 300 29
in 0 300 29
the 0 300 29
intelligence 0 300 29
budget. 0 300 29

We 0 300 30
are 0 300 30
doing 0 300 30
NATO 0 300 30
exercises 0 300 30
in 0 300 30
the 0 300 30
Baltics. 0 300 30

We 0 300 31
provided 0 300 31
legal 0 300 31
aid 0 300 31
to 0 300 31
Ukraine 0 300 31
and 0 300 31
Georgia. 0 300 31

We’re 0 300 32
developing 0 300 32
low-yield 0 300 32
nuclear 0 300 32
weapons. 0 300 32

He 0 300 33
implemented 0 300 33
sanctions 0 300 33
that 0 300 33
were 0 300 33
even 0 300 33
stronger 0 300 33
than 0 300 33
required 0 300 33
by 0 300 33
Congressional 0 300 33
mandate. 0 300 33

So 0 300 34
if 0 300 34
you 0 300 34
care 0 300 34
about 0 300 34
actual 0 300 34
actions, 0 300 34
I 0 300 34
think 0 300 34
there’s 0 300 34
a 0 300 34
lot 0 300 34
to 0 300 34
be 0 300 34
happy 0 300 34
about 0 300 34
in 0 300 34
terms 0 300 34
of 0 300 34
a 0 300 34
tough 1 300 34
posture 0 300 34
towards 0 300 34
Russia. 0 300 34

People 0 300 35
are 0 300 35
obsessed 0 300 35
about 0 300 35
words 0 300 35
and 0 300 35
they 0 300 35
should 0 300 35
maybe 0 300 35
focus 0 300 35
on 0 300 35
the 0 300 35
actions 0 300 35
as 0 300 35
well. 0 300 35

Former 0 300 36
Speaker 0 300 36
of 0 300 36
the 0 300 36
House, 0 300 36
Newt 0 300 36
Gingrich, 0 300 36
concurred 0 300 36
with 0 300 36
Hemingway 0 300 36
arguing 0 300 36
that 0 300 36
by 0 300 36
any 0 300 36
standard 0 300 36
Trump 0 300 36
has 0 300 36
been 0 300 36
far 0 300 36
tougher 0 300 36
on 0 300 36
Russia 0 300 36
than 0 300 36
Obama 0 300 36
was. 0 300 36

First, 0 300 37
the 0 300 37
very 0 300 37
people 0 300 37
who 0 300 37
have 0 300 37
been 0 300 37
loudest 0 300 37
in 0 300 37
attacking 0 300 37
President 0 300 37
Trump 0 300 37
about 0 300 37
his 0 300 37
performance 0 300 37
at 0 300 37
the 0 300 37
Helsinki 0 300 37
summit 0 300 37
are 0 300 37
the 0 300 37
people 0 300 37
who 0 300 37
failed 0 300 37
to 0 300 37
protect 1 300 37
America 1 300 37
from 0 300 37
Russian 0 300 37
meddling 0 300 37
in 0 300 37
2016. 0 300 37

The 0 300 38
very 1 300 38
intensity 0 300 38
and 0 300 38
nastiness 1 300 38
of 0 300 38
former 0 300 38
CIA 0 300 38
Director 0 300 38
Brennan 0 300 38
and 0 300 38
former 0 300 38
Director 0 300 38
of 0 300 38
National 0 300 38
Intelligence 0 300 38
Clapper 0 300 38
is 0 300 38
an 0 300 38
attempt 0 300 38
to 0 300 38
distract 0 300 38
attention 0 300 38
from 0 300 38
their 0 300 38
failure 0 300 38
to 0 300 38
protect 1 300 38
America. 1 300 38

It 0 300 39
was 0 300 39
their 0 300 39
duty 0 300 39
in 0 300 39
2016 0 300 39
– 0 300 39
not 0 300 39
candidate 0 300 39
Trump’s. 0 300 39

Second, 0 300 40
the 0 300 40
Trump 0 300 40
administration 0 300 40
has 0 300 40
been 0 300 40
far 0 300 40
tougher 1 300 40
on 0 300 40
Russia 0 300 40
than 0 300 40
President 0 300 40
Obama 0 300 40
ever 0 300 40
dreamed 0 300 40
of 0 300 40
being. 0 300 40

The 1 300 41
Trump 1 300 41
administration 1 300 41
is 0 300 41
taking 0 300 41
real 0 300 41
actions 0 300 41
designed 0 300 41
to 0 300 41
weaken 0 300 41
Russia 0 300 41
and 0 300 41
force 0 300 41
Putin 0 300 41
to 0 300 41
change 0 300 41
his 0 300 41
aggressive 1 300 41
behavior. 0 300 41

The 1 300 42
Trump 1 300 42
administration 1 300 42
has 0 300 42
levied 0 300 42
tough 1 300 42
sanctions 0 300 42
on 0 300 42
Russia. 0 300 42

Also, 0 300 43
President 0 300 43
Trump’s 0 300 43
public 0 300 43
lecture 0 300 43
about 0 300 43
Germany 0 300 43
not 0 300 43
buying 0 300 43
natural 0 300 43
gas 0 300 43
from 0 300 43
Russia 0 300 43
was 0 300 43
aimed 0 300 43
at 0 300 43
cutting 0 300 43
Putin 0 300 43
off 0 300 43
from 0 300 43
hard 0 300 43
currency 0 300 43
worth 0 300 43
tens 0 300 43
of 0 300 43
billions 0 300 43
of 0 300 43
dollars 0 300 43
and 0 300 43
further 0 300 43
weakening 0 300 43
the 0 300 43
Russian 0 300 43
economy. 0 300 43

Furthermore, 0 300 44
President 0 300 44
Trump’s 0 300 44
efforts 0 300 44
to 0 300 44
get 0 300 44
our 1 300 44
European 0 300 44
allies 0 300 44
to 0 300 44
increase 0 300 44
their 0 300 44
defense 0 300 44
spending 0 300 44
has 0 300 44
a 0 300 44
direct 0 300 44

beating 0 302 23
for 0 302 23
war 0 302 23
with 0 302 23
Iran. 0 302 23

The 0 302 24
rhetoric 0 302 24
is 0 302 24
becoming 0 302 24
so 0 302 24
strong, 0 302 24
that 0 302 24
Trump 0 302 24
himself 0 302 24
— 0 302 24
without 0 302 24
provocation 0 302 24
— 0 302 24
began 0 302 24
tweeting 0 302 24
threats 0 302 24
to 0 302 24
the 0 302 24
sovereign 0 302 24

On 0 302 25
Tuesday, 0 302 25
Fox 0 302 25
News 0 302 25
host 0 302 25
Tucker 0 302 25
Carlson 0 302 25
and 0 302 25
Colonel 0 302 25
Douglas 0 302 25
Macgregor 0 302 25
addressed 0 302 25
the 0 302 25
growing 0 302 25
prospect 0 302 25
of 0 302 25
US 0 302 25
war 0 302 25
with 0 302 25
Iran 0 302 25
and 0 302 25
warned 0 302 25
that 0 302 25
a 0 302 25
new 0 302 25
“Gulf 0 302 25
of 0 302 25
Tonkin 0 302 25
incident” 0 302 25
could 0 302 25
be 0 302 25
used 0 302 25
to 0 302 25
drag 0 302 25
us 0 302 25
into 0 302 25
it. 0 302 25

Carlson 0 302 26
mocked 0 302 26
the 0 302 26
neocons’ 0 302 26
claims 0 302 26
that 0 302 26
Iran 0 302 26
is 0 302 26
the 0 302 26
“greatest 1 302 26
threat” 1 302 26
to 0 302 26
America, 1 302 26
explicitly 0 302 26
noting 0 302 26
that 0 302 26
“virtually 0 302 26
every 0 302 26
attack 0 302 26
in 0 302 26
America 0 302 26
has 0 302 26
been 0 302 26
inspired 0 302 26
not 0 302 26
by 0 302 26
Iran, 0 302 26
but 0 302 26
by 0 302 26
Iran’s 0 302 26
Sunni 0 302 26
enemies.” 0 302 26

Carlson 0 302 27
pointed 0 302 27
out 0 302 27
how 0 302 27
the 0 302 27
neocons 0 302 27
are 0 302 27
hellbent 1 302 27
on 0 302 27
pushing 0 302 27
the 0 302 27
Trump 0 302 27
administration 0 302 27
into 0 302 27
a 0 302 27
new 0 302 27
war. 0 302 27

“If 0 302 28
there 0 302 28
was 0 302 28
ever 0 302 28
a 0 302 28
swamp 0 302 28
in 0 302 28
Washington 0 302 28
you 0 302 28
are 0 302 28
looking 0 302 28
at 0 302 28
it 0 302 28
— 0 302 28
the 0 302 28
foreign 0 302 28
policy 0 302 28
establishment 0 302 28
— 0 302 28
they 0 302 28
are 0 302 28
working 0 302 28
overtime 0 302 28
to 0 302 28
ensnare 1 302 28
the 0 302 28
president 0 302 28
in 0 302 28
a 0 302 28
mess 0 302 28
in 0 302 28
Iran,” 0 302 28
Carlson 0 302 28
said. 0 302 28

“Let’s 0 302 29
hope 0 302 29
that 0 302 29
he 0 302 29
understands 0 302 29
exactly 0 302 29
what’s 0 302 29
going 0 302 29
on.” 0 302 29

Pointing 0 302 30
out 0 302 30
Trump’s 0 302 30
recent 0 302 30
attempts 0 302 30
at 0 302 30
diplomacy 0 302 30
with 0 302 30
North 0 302 30
Korea 0 302 30
and 0 302 30
Russia, 0 302 30
Col. 0 302 30
Macgregor 0 302 30
weighed 0 302 30
in, 0 302 30
noting 0 302 30
that 0 302 30
he 0 302 30
thinks 0 302 30
Trump 0 302 30
will 0 302 30
attempt 0 302 30
to 0 302 30
avoid 0 302 30
war 0 302 30
with 0 302 30
Iran. 0 302 30

However, 0 302 31
he 0 302 31
noted 0 302 31
that 0 302 31
a 0 302 31
false 0 302 31
flag 0 302 31
could 0 302 31
be 0 302 31
used 0 302 31
to 0 302 31
drag 0 302 31
us 0 302 31
into 0 302 31
it. 0 302 31

“I 0 302 32
think 0 302 32
the 0 302 32
president 0 302 32
needs 0 302 32
to 0 302 32
watch 0 302 32
carefully 0 302 32
for 0 302 32
the 0 302 32
potential 0 302 32
for 0 302 32
something 0 302 32
like 0 302 32
the 0 302 32
Gulf 0 302 32
of 0 302 32
Tonkin 0 302 32
incident,” 0 302 32
Col. 0 302 32
Macgregor 0 302 32
said. 0 302 32

“Many 0 302 33
of 0 302 33
your 0 302 33
viewers 0 302 33
may 0 302 33
not 0 302 33
remember 0 302 33
that 0 302 33
it 0 302 33
never 0 302 33
happened 0 302 33
and 0 302 33
we 0 302 33
could 0 302 33
very 0 302 33
well 0 302 33
be 0 302 33
treated 0 302 33
to 0 302 33
something 0 302 33
like 0 302 33
that 0 302 33
in 0 302 33
the 0 302 33
Gulf. 0 302 33

We 0 302 34
should 0 302 34
watch 0 302 34
for 0 302 34
that, 0 302 34
and 0 302 34
this 0 302 34
is 0 302 34
an 0 302 34
example 0 302 34
of 0 302 34
President 0 302 34
Trump’s 0 302 34
comments 0 302 34
on 0 302 34
fake 0 302 34
news, 0 302 34
he 0 302 34
should 0 302 34
not 0 302 34
be 0 302 34
sabotage 0 302 34
by 0 302 34
fake 0 302 34
news.” 0 302 34

Carlson 0 302 35
then 0 302 35
pointed 0 302 35
out 0 302 35
how 0 302 35
the 0 302 35
Trump 0 302 35
admin 0 302 35
has 0 302 35
reacted 0 302 35
to 0 302 35
fake 0 302 35
news 0 302 35
by 0 302 35
attacking 0 302 35
Syria—twice. 0 302 35

For 0 302 36
those 0 302 36
who 0 302 36
may 0 302 36
be 0 302 36
unaware, 0 302 36
the 0 302 36
plan 0 302 36
to 0 302 36
overthrow 0 302 36
Iran 0 302 36
has 0 302 36
long 0 302 36
been 0 302 36
in 0 302 36
the 0 302 36
works. 0 302 36

In 0 302 37
fact, 0 302 37
in 0 302 37
April 0 302 37
2012, 0 302 37
Pulitzer 0 302 37
Prize-winning 0 302 37
journalist, 0 302 37
Seymour 0 302 37
Hersh 0 302 37
reported 0 302 37
that 0 302 37
the 0 302 37
U.S. 0 302 37
Joint 0 302 37
Special 0 302 37
Operations 0 302 37

MEK 0 302 37
operatives 0 302 37
at 0 302 37
a 0 302 37
secret 0 302 37
site 0 302 37
in 0 302 37
Nevada 0 302 37
from 0 302 37
2005 0 302 37
to 0 302 37
2009. 0 302 37

MEK 0 302 38
is 0 302 38
the 0 302 38
Iranian 0 302 38
political-militant 0 302 38
organization 0 302 38
that 0 302 38
advocates 0 302 38
for 0 302 38
the 0 302 38
violent 0 302 38
overthrow 0 302 38
of 0 302 38
the 0 302 38
current 0 302 38
Iranian 0 302 38
regime. 0 302 38

They 0 302 39
are 0 302 39
hardly 0 302 39
quiet 0 302 39
about 0 302 39
it. 0 302 39

According 0 302 40
to 0 302 40
Hersh, 0 302 40
MEK 0 302 40
members 0 302 40
were 0 302 40
trained 0 302 40
in 0 302 40
intercepting 0 302 40
communications, 0 302 40
cryptography, 0 302 40
weaponry 0 302 40
and 0 302 40
small 0 302 40

tactics 0 302 40
at 0 302 40
the 0 302 40
Nevada 0 302 40

until 0 302 40
President 0 302 40
Barack 0 302 40
Obama 0 302 40
took 0 302 40
office 0 302 40
in 0 302 40
2009. 0 302 40

Hersh 0 302 41
also 0 302 41
reported 0 302 41
additional 0 302 41
names 0 302 41
of 0 302 41
former 0 302 41
U.S. 0 302 41
officials 0 302 41
paid 0 302 41
to 0 302 41
speak 0 302 41
in 0 302 41
support 0 302 41
of 0 302 41
MEK, 0 302 41
including 0 302 41
former 0 302 41
CIA 0 302 41
directors 0 302 41
James 0 302 41
Woolsey 0 302 41

U.N. 0 302 41

Ambassador 0 302 42
John 0 302 42
Bolton. 0 302 42

Coincidentally, 0 302 43
MEK 0 302 43
was 0 302 43
classified 0 302 43
as 0 302 43
a 0 302 43
terrorist 0 302 43
organization 0 302 43
by 0 302 43
the 0 302 43
United 0 302 43
States 0 302 43
and 0 302 43
its 0 302 43
allies—during 0 302 43
this 0 302 43
training 0 302 43
period—until 0 302 43
they 0 302 43
suddenly 0 302 43
removed 0 302 43
them 0 302 43
from 0 302 43
the 0 302 43
list 0 302 43
in 0 302 43
2012. 0 302 43

While 0 302 44
the 0 302 44
current 0 302 44
Iranian 0 302 44
regime 0 302 44
is 0 302 44
certainly 0 302 44
no 0 302 44
bastion 0 302 44
of 0 302 44
freedom, 0 302 44
the 0 302 44
idea 0 302 44
that 0 302 44
US 0 302 44
intervention 0 302 44
or 0 302 44
a 0 302 44
violent 0 302 44
revolution 0 302 44
would 0 302 44
be 0 302 44
beneficial 0 302 44
for 0 302 44
the 0 302 44
people 0 302 44
of 0 302 44
Iran 0 302 44
is 0 302 44
outright 1 302 44
insane. 1 302 44

To 0 302 45
see 0 302 45
what 0 302 45
US 0 302 45
intervention—through 0 302 45
military 0 302 45
support 0 302 45
and 0 302 45
the 0 302 45
support 0 302 45
of 0 302 45
‘protesters’—does 0 302 45
to 0 302 45
countries, 0 302 45
one 0 302 45
need 0 302 45
only 0 302 45
look 0 302 45
at 0 302 45
Syria, 0 302 45
Iraq, 0 302 45
Afghanistan, 0 302 45
and 0 302 45
Libya 0 302 45
to 0 302 45
see 0 302 45
the 0 302 45
horrific 1 302 45
death 0 302 45
tolls 0 302 45
and 0 302 45
war-ravaged 1 302 45
dystopias 1 302 45
left 0 302 45
in 0 302 45
America’s 0 302 45
wake. 0 302 45

To 0 302 46
those 0 302 46
paying 0 302 46
attention 0 302 46
over 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
years, 0 302 46
Trump’s 0 302 46
desire 0 302 46
to 0 302 46
intervene 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
Iran, 0 302 46
and 0 302 46
his 0 302 46
subsequent 0 302 46
support 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
media 0 302 46
should 0 302 46
come 0 302 46
as 0 302 46
no 0 302 46
surprise 0 302 46
as 0 302 46
it 0 302 46
has 0 302 46
been 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
plan 0 302 46
since 0 302 46
Bill 0 302 46
Clinton 0 302 46
was 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
office 0 302 46
and 0 302 46
was 0 302 46
documented 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
neoconservative 0 302 46
PNAC 0 302 46
report. 0 302 46

This 0 302 47
was 0 302 47
even 0 302 47
admitted 0 302 47
by 0 302 47
General 0 302 47
Wesley 0 302 47
Clark, 0 302 47
former 0 302 47
Supreme 0 302 47
Allied 0 302 47
Commander 0 302 47
of 0 302 47
NATO, 0 302 47
that 0 302 47
the 0 302 47
U.S. 0 302 47
planned 0 302 47
on 0 302 47
going 0 302 47
to 0 302 47
war 0 302 47
with 0 302 47
Iran, 0 302 47
according 0 302 47
to 0 302 47
a 0 302 47
2001 0 302 47
memo 0 302 47
from 0 302 47
the 0 302 47
U.S. 0 302 47
Secretary 0 302 47
of 0 302 47
Defense. 0 302 47

“This 0 302 48
is 0 302 48
a 0 302 48
memo 0 302 48
that 0 302 48
describes 0 302 48
how 0 302 48
we’re 0 302 48
going 0 302 48
to 0 302 48
take 0 302 48
out 0 302 48
seven 0 302 48
countries 0 302 48
in 0 302 48
five 0 302 48
years,” 0 302 48
Clark 0 302 48
said. 0 302 48

“Starting 0 302 49
with 0 302 49
Iraq, 0 302 49
and 0 302 49
then 0 302 49

Libya, 0 302 49
Somalia, 0 302 49
Sudan, 0 302 49
and 0 302 49
finishing 0 302 49
off 0 302 49
with 0 302 49
Iran.” 0 302 49

All 0 302 50
presidents 0 302 50
since 0 302 50
Clinton 0 302 50
have 0 302 50
crossed 0 302 50
countries 0 302 50
off 0 302 50
this 0 302 50
list. 0 302 50

Now 0 302 51

The 0 303 8
case 0 303 8
involves 0 303 8
Cody 0 303 8
Wilson, 0 303 8
founder 0 303 8
of 0 303 8
Defense 0 303 8

who 0 303 8
sued 0 303 8

2015 0 303 8
after 0 303 8

under 0 303 8
the 0 303 8
Obama 0 303 8

take 0 303 8
down 0 303 8

he 0 303 8
had 0 303 8
posted 0 303 8
online, 0 303 8
saying 0 303 8
they 0 303 8

Mr. 0 303 9
Wilson, 0 303 9
an 1 303 9
avowed 1 303 9
anarchist 1 303 9
who 1 303 9
hopes 1 303 9
for 1 303 9
a 1 303 9
world 1 303 9
in 1 303 9
which 1 303 9
governments 1 303 9
can’t 1 303 9
stop 1 303 9
individuals 1 303 9
from 1 303 9
getting 1 303 9
guns, 1 303 9
claimed 0 303 9
his 0 303 9
First 0 303 9
Amendment 0 303 9
right 0 303 9
to 0 303 9
free 0 303 9
speech 0 303 9
was 0 303 9
being 0 303 9
violated. 0 303 9

But 0 303 10
he 0 303 10
lost 0 303 10
at 0 303 10
every 0 303 10
stage 0 303 10
of 0 303 10
litigation, 0 303 10
including 0 303 10
a 0 303 10
refusal 0 303 10
by 0 303 10
the 0 303 10
Supreme 0 303 10
Court 0 303 10
to 0 303 10
review 0 303 10
a 0 303 10
decision 0 303 10
that 0 303 10
the 0 303 10

could 0 303 10
not 0 303 10

the 0 303 10

of 0 303 10

lawsuit. 0 303 10

So 1 303 11
it 1 303 11
was 1 303 11
stunning 1 303 11
— 0 303 11
but 1 303 11
not 1 303 11
surprising, 1 303 11
given 1 303 11

No 0 304 18

Yes, 0 304 35
the 0 304 35

has 0 304 35
nearly 0 304 35
completed 0 304 35
his 0 304 35

of 0 304 35
modernizing 0 304 35
the 0 304 35

Church 0 304 35
in 0 304 35

priests. 0 304 37

After 0 304 38
5 0 304 38
long 0 304 38
years, 0 304 38
his 0 304 38
unrelenting 0 304 38

mantra 0 304 38
seemingly 0 304 38
extends 0 304 38
only 0 304 38
to 0 304 38

on 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
cover 0 304 39
of 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
Advocate, 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
gay 0 304 39

as 0 304 39
its 0 304 39
Man 0 304 39
of 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
Year. 0 304 39

He 0 304 40
lapped 0 304 40
up 0 304 40
the 0 304 40
accolades 0 304 40
from 0 304 40
the 0 304 40

Yet, 0 304 41
fame 0 304 41
is 0 304 41
and 0 304 41
predation 1 304 41
is 1 304 41
unrelenting, 1 304 41
even 0 304 41
for 0 304 41
Popes. 0 304 41

In 0 304 42
the 0 304 42
words 0 304 42
of 0 304 42
Queen 0 304 42
Elizabeth, 0 304 42
this 0 304 42
year 0 304 42

been 0 304 42
annus 0 304 42
horribilis 0 304 42
for 0 304 42
Francis. 0 304 42

Excuse 0 304 43
the 0 304 43
gay 0 304 43
slang 0 304 43
pun 0 304 43
but, 0 304 43
the 0 304 43
chickens 0 304 43
have 0 304 43
come 0 304 43
home 0 304 43

The 0 304 44

of 0 304 44
papal 0 304 44

toppling 0 304 44
the 0 304 44
barque 0 304 44
of 0 304 44
Peter. 0 304 44

Will 0 304 45
Catholic 0 304 45
laity 0 304 45
pay 0 304 45
attention 0 304 45
and 0 304 45
take 0 304 45
action? 0 304 45

The 0 304 46
McCarrick 0 304 46
scandal 0 304 46
created 0 304 46
an 0 304 46
earthquake 1 304 46
in 0 304 46
the 0 304 46
Catholic 0 304 46
Church 0 304 46
with 0 304 46

that 0 304 46
will 0 304 46
last 0 304 46
for 0 304 46
years. 0 304 46

The 0 304 47
timing 0 304 47
is 0 304 47
eerily 1 304 47
propitious 0 304 47
and 0 304 47
providential 0 304 47
based 0 304 47
on 0 304 47
the 0 304 47
5 0 304 47
year 0 304 47
deadline. 0 304 47

Will 0 304 48
the 0 304 48
laity 0 304 48
step 0 304 48
up 0 304 48
and 0 304 48
reclaim 0 304 48
our 0 304 48
hijacked 1 304 48
Catholic 0 304 48
Church? 0 304 48

This 0 304 49
critical 0 304 49
time 0 304 49
in 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
history 0 304 49
of 0 304 49
the 0 304 49

Church 0 304 49
demands 0 304 49
that 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
laity 0 304 49
step 0 304 49
forward 0 304 49
to 0 304 49
protect 0 304 49
the 0 304 49

and 0 304 49
seminarians 0 304 49
from 0 304 49
predators. 0 304 49

We 0 304 50
must 0 304 50
close 0 304 50
ranks 0 304 50
before 0 304 50
another 0 304 50

reform 0 304 52

upcoming 0 304 53
Synod 0 304 53
on 0 304 53

vehicle 0 304 53
for 0 304 53
the 0 304 53

modernist 0 304 53
reform 0 304 53
of 0 304 53

Gallen 1 304 53
Mafia. 1 304 53

This 0 304 54
Synod 0 304 54
is 0 304 54
designed 0 304 54
to 0 304 54
exploit 0 304 54
the 0 304 54
youth, 0 304 54
like 0 304 54
they’ve 0 304 54
been 0 304 54
doing 0 304 54
for 0 304 54
the 0 304 54

If 0 304 55
it 0 304 55
weren’t 0 304 55
so 0 304 55
infuriating, 1 304 55
it 0 304 55
would 0 304 55
be 0 304 55

that 0 304 55

and 0 304 55
covered 0 304 55

by 0 304 55
Bishops, 0 304 55
the 0 304 55
Catholic 0 304 55

would 0 304 55
host 0 304 55
a 0 304 55

this 0 304 56
nightmare 0 304 56
of 0 304 56

Lest 0 304 92

notes 0 304 93
that 0 304 93
the 0 304 93
upcoming 0 304 93

is 0 304 93
to 0 304 93
“make 0 304 93

excluded.” 0 304 93

This 0 304 94
papacy 0 304 94
is 0 304 94
awash 0 304 94
in 0 304 94

Not 0 304 95

the 0 305 1

The 0 305 4

In 0 305 39
fact, 0 305 39
the 0 305 39

The 0 305 40
lawsuit 0 305 40
also 0 305 40
argues 0 305 40
the 0 305 40

violates 0 305 40
the 0 305 40
Tenth 0 305 40
Amendment 0 305 40

infringing 0 305 40

Washington 0 305 41
has 0 305 41
a 0 305 41
robust 0 305 41
regulatory 0 305 41
system 0 305 41
meant 0 305 41
to 0 305 41

of 0 305 41
dangerous 0 305 41
individuals. 0 305 41

That 0 305 42
system 0 305 42
is 0 305 42
jeopardized 0 305 42
by 0 305 42
the 0 305 42
Trump 0 305 42
Administration's 0 305 42
action 0 305 42

will 0 305 42

Note 0 305 43
that 0 305 43
Ferguson 0 305 43
forgets 0 305 43
that 0 305 43
the 0 305 43
Tenth 0 305 43

states 0 305 43
plainly: 0 305 43

The 0 305 44

(emphasis 0 305 45

Since 0 305 46
our 0 305 46
founders 0 305 46
clearly 0 305 46
said 0 305 46
that 0 305 46

this 0 305 46

a 0 305 46
right 0 305 46

do 0 305 46
just 0 305 46
that, 0 305 46
infringe 1 305 46
on 1 305 46

he 0 305 47
is 0 305 47
reading 0 305 47
something 0 305 47
into 0 305 47
it 0 305 47
that 0 305 47
is 0 305 47
simply 0 305 47
not 0 305 47
there, 0 305 47

that's 0 305 47
a 0 305 47
Communist 1 305 47

you 0 305 47
are 0 305 47

off 0 305 54
the 0 305 54

via 0 305 54
Twitter. 0 305 54

He 0 305 55
told 0 305 55
me 0 305 55
five 0 305 55
years 0 305 55
ago, 0 305 55
when 0 305 55
I 0 305 55
was 0 305 55
writing 0 305 55
a 0 305 55
feature 0 305 55
story 0 305 55
on 0 305 55
the 0 305 55

his 0 305 55

the 0 305 55
government 0 305 55
over 0 305 55
gun-making 0 305 55
files, 0 305 55
that 0 305 55
"This 0 305 55
has 0 305 55
been 0 305 55
a 0 305 55
continuous 0 305 55
process 0 305 55
of 0 305 55
different 0 305 55
levels 0 305 55
of 0 305 55
authority 0 305 55
figures 0 305 55
trying 0 305 55
to 0 305 55
stop 0 305 55
it 0 305 55
from 0 305 55
happening 0 305 55
and 0 305 55
thus 0 305 55
allowing 0 305 55
it 0 305 55
to 0 305 55
happen...Of 0 305 55
course 0 305 55
we 0 305 55
are 0 305 55
going 0 305 55
to 0 305 55
succeed—because 0 305 55
you 0 305 55
all 0 305 55
are 0 305 55
trying 0 305 55
to 0 305 55
stop 0 305 55
me. 0 305 55

That 0 305 56
seemed 0 305 56
natural 0 305 56
and 0 305 56
ended 0 305 56
up 0 305 56
being 0 305 56
true." 0 305 56

So 0 305 57
far, 0 305 57
that 0 305 57
has 0 305 57
continued 0 305 57
to 0 305 57
be 0 305 57
true. 0 305 57

This 1 305 58
federal 1 305 58
judge 1 305 58
should 1 305 58
know 1 305 58
what 1 305 58
the 1 305 58
Constitution 1 305 58
actually 1 305 58
says 1 305 58
and 0 305 58
should 0 305 58
have 0 305 58
tossed 0 305 58
this 0 305 58
frivolous 1 305 58
lawsuit 0 305 58

the 0 305 58
trash 0 305 58
where 0 305 58
it 0 305 58
belongs. 0 305 58

Instead, 0 305 59
he 0 305 59
is 0 305 59
demonstrating 0 305 59
he 0 305 59
is 0 305 59
not 1 305 59

of 0 305 59
each 0 305 59
of 0 305 59
these 0 305 59
states 0 305 59
are 0 305 59
demonstrating 0 305 59
they 0 305 59
are 0 305 59
not 1 305 59

shadow 1 311 3
without 1 311 3
hope 1 311 3
of 1 311 3
reprieve. 1 311 3

God 0 311 4
made 0 311 4
that 0 311 4
clear 0 311 4
when 0 311 4
He 0 311 4
told 0 311 4
Adam 0 311 4
that 0 311 4
“in 0 311 4
what 0 311 4
day 0 311 4
soever” 0 311 4
he 0 311 4
preferred 0 311 4
his 0 311 4
own 0 311 4
will 0 311 4
above 0 311 4
his 0 311 4
Creator’s, 0 311 4
“thou 1 311 4
shalt 1 311 4
die 1 311 4
the 1 311 4
death,” 1 311 4
condemning 0 311 4
him 0 311 4
sooner 0 311 4
or 0 311 4
later 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
“return 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
the 0 311 4
earth 0 311 4
out 0 311 4
of 0 311 4
which 0 311 4
thou 0 311 4
wast 0 311 4
taken: 0 311 4
for 0 311 4
dust 0 311 4
thou 0 311 4
art, 0 311 4
and 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
dust 0 311 4
thou 0 311 4
shalt 0 311 4
return” 0 311 4
(Gen. 0 311 4
3:19). 0 311 4

In 0 311 5
other 0 311 5
words, 0 311 5
there 1 311 5
has 1 311 5
always 1 311 5
been 1 311 5
a 1 311 5
death 1 311 5
penalty. 1 311 5

God 1 311 6
instituted 1 311 6
it, 1 311 6
and 1 311 6
He 1 311 6
was 1 311 6
the 1 311 6
first 1 311 6
to 1 311 6
impose 1 311 6
it, 1 311 6
embedding 1 311 6
it 1 311 6
in 1 311 6
the 1 311 6
very 1 311 6
fabric 1 311 6
of 1 311 6
natural 1 311 6
law. 1 311 6

When 0 311 7
Cain 0 311 7
took 0 311 7
it 0 311 7
upon 0 311 7
himself 0 311 7
to 0 311 7
inflict 0 311 7
death 0 311 7
on 0 311 7
his 0 311 7
brother 0 311 7
Abel 0 311 7
“in 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
field,” 0 311 7
he 0 311 7
soon 0 311 7
learned 0 311 7
that 0 311 7
God 0 311 7
furthermore 0 311 7
reserved 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
exercise 0 311 7
of 0 311 7
this 0 311 7
right 0 311 7
to 0 311 7
himself 0 311 7
alone. 0 311 7

Cain 0 311 8
is 0 311 8
told, 0 311 8
“What 0 311 8
hast 0 311 8
thou 0 311 8
done? 0 311 8

The 0 311 9
voice 0 311 9
of 0 311 9
thy 0 311 9
brother’s 0 311 9
blood 0 311 9
crieth 0 311 9
to 0 311 9
me 0 311 9
from 0 311 9
the 0 311 9
earth,” 0 311 9
and 0 311 9
God 1 311 9
curses 1 311 9
him 1 311 9
for 0 311 9
his 0 311 9
presumption 0 311 9
by 0 311 9
dooming 1 311 9
him 1 311 9
to 0 311 9
homelessness 0 311 9
and 0 311 9
unproductive 0 311 9
labor. 0 311 9

When 0 311 10
Cain 0 311 10
complains 0 311 10
that 0 311 10
being 0 311 10
a 1 311 10
“vagabond 1 311 10
. 0 311 10

. 0 311 11

. 0 311 12

on 0 311 13
the 0 311 13
earth, 0 311 13
every 0 311 13
one 0 311 13
therefore 0 311 13
that 0 311 13
findeth 0 311 13
me, 0 311 13
shall 0 311 13
kill 0 311 13
me,” 0 311 13
God 0 311 13
laid 0 311 13
down 0 311 13
that 0 311 13
“whoever 0 311 13
shall 0 311 13
kill 0 311 13
Cain 0 311 13
shall 0 311 13
be 0 311 13
punished 1 311 13
sevenfold,” 1 311 13
setting 0 311 13
a 0 311 13
mysterious 0 311 13
identifying 0 311 13
mark 0 311 13
on 0 311 13
him 0 311 13
to 0 311 13
protect 0 311 13
him 0 311 13
from 0 311 13
the 0 311 13
vengeance 0 311 13
of 0 311 13
others. 0 311 13

The 0 311 14
Fifth 0 311 14
Commandment 0 311 14
later 0 311 14
delivered 0 311 14
to 0 311 14
Moses, 0 311 14
“Thou 0 311 14
shalt 0 311 14
not 0 311 14
kill,” 0 311 14
therefore 0 311 14
dates 0 311 14
from 0 311 14
adamic 0 311 14
times, 0 311 14
when 0 311 14
it 0 311 14
operated 0 311 14
as 0 311 14
God’s 0 311 14
exclusive 0 311 14
prerogative, 0 311 14
allowing 0 311 14
no 0 311 14
exceptions. 0 311 14

Although 0 311 15
men 0 311 15
certainly 0 311 15
continued 0 311 15
to 0 311 15
kill 0 311 15
one 0 311 15
another 0 311 15
in 0 311 15
a 0 311 15
society 0 311 15
which 0 311 15
in 0 311 15
fact 0 311 15
became 0 311 15
so 1 311 15
wicked 1 311 15
"that 0 311 15
all 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
thought 0 311 15

was 0 311 15
bent 0 311 15
upon 0 311 15
evil 0 311 15
at 0 311 15
all 0 311 15
times," 0 311 15
they 0 311 15
did 0 311 15
so 0 311 15
as 0 311 15
murderers, 0 311 15
outside 0 311 15
God's 0 311 15
law 0 311 15
without 0 311 15
legal 0 311 15
right. 0 311 15

Only 0 311 16

would 0 311 55
therefore 0 311 55
dictate 0 311 55
a 0 311 55
reassessment 0 311 55
of 0 311 55

the 0 311 56

there 0 311 56
is 0 311 56
more 0 311 56
and 0 311 56
more 0 311 56
discussion 0 311 56
about 0 311 56
society’s 0 311 56
responsibility 0 311 56
for 0 311 56
having 0 311 56
produced 0 311 56
criminals 0 311 56
in 0 311 56
the 0 311 56

The 0 311 57
idea 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
man 0 311 57
is 0 311 57
by 0 311 57
nature 0 311 57
good 0 311 57
and 0 311 57
perfectible 0 311 57
is 0 311 57
allowed 0 311 57
to 0 311 57
override 0 311 57
all 0 311 57
documented 0 311 57
evidence 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
hardened 0 311 57
criminals 0 311 57
are 0 311 57
in 0 311 57
fact 0 311 57
almost 0 311 57
impossible 0 311 57
to 0 311 57

that 0 311 57
those 0 311 57

sentences 0 311 57
rarely 0 311 57

According 0 311 58
to 0 311 58
one 0 311 58
widely 0 311 58
held 0 311 58
opinion, 0 311 58
the 0 311 58
death 0 311 58
penalty 0 311 58
has 0 311 58
proved 0 311 58
to 0 311 58
be 0 311 58
no 0 311 58
effective 0 311 58
deterrent 0 311 58
to 0 311 58
crime 0 311 58
in 0 311 58
any 0 311 58
case, 0 311 58
and 0 311 58
should 0 311 58
be 0 311 58
discarded 0 311 58

impractical. 0 311 58

What 1 311 59
proof 1 311 59
of 1 311 59
this 1 311 59
can 1 311 59

be 1 311 59
offered? 1 311 59

How 1 311 60
can 1 311 60
we 1 311 60

know? 1 311 61
Deterrence 0 311 61
from 0 311 61
evil 0 311 61
is 0 311 61
not 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
primary 0 311 61
purpose 0 311 61
of 0 311 61
meting 0 311 61
out 0 311 61
punishment 0 311 61
in 0 311 61
any 0 311 61
case, 0 311 61
yet 0 311 61
Scripture 0 311 61
attests 0 311 61
to 0 311 61
deterrence 0 311 61
as 0 311 61
an 0 311 61
important 0 311 61

And 0 311 68
the 0 311 68
Preacher 0 311 68
notes 0 311 68
that 0 311 68
when 1 311 68

To 0 311 70

how 1 311 70
shallow 1 311 70
Catholic 1 311 70
thinking 1 311 70
on 1 311 70
the 1 311 70
death 1 311 70

has 1 311 70
become 1 311 70
and 1 311 70
how 1 311 70
far 1 311 70
it 1 311 70
has 1 311 70
deviated 1 311 70
from 1 311 70
the 1 311 70
age-old 1 311 70
doctrine 1 311 70
of 1 311 70
the 1 311 70
Church, 1 311 70
a 0 311 70

of 0 311 71

it 0 311 72
is, 0 311 72
immoral 1 311 72
heretics. 1 311 72

To 0 311 73
approach 0 311 73
this 0 311 73
as 0 311 73
a 0 311 73
dogmatic 0 311 73
teaching 0 311 73
is 0 311 73
imprudent. 1 311 73

Those 0 311 74
who 0 311 74
argue 0 311 74
for 0 311 74
its 0 311 74
abolition 0 311 74
do 0 311 74
not 0 311 74
necessarily 0 311 74
put 0 311 74
society 0 311 74
in 0 311 74
danger 0 311 74
considering 0 311 74
possibilities 0 311 74
of 0 311 74
penal 0 311 74
systems. 0 311 74

Those, 0 311 75
however, 0 311 75
who 0 311 75
maintain 0 311 75
its 0 311 75
continued 0 311 75
use 0 311 75
often 0 311 75
see 0 311 75
it 0 311 75
more 0 311 75
as 0 311 75
a 1 311 75
tool 1 311 75
for 1 311 75
revenge. 1 311 75

Please 0 311 76
consider 0 311 76
that 0 311 76
in 0 311 76
anger 0 311 76
and 0 311 76
tragedy, 0 311 76
the 0 311 76
desire 0 311 76
for 0 311 76
revenge 0 311 76
usually 0 311 76
overrides 0 311 76
reason 0 311 76
and 0 311 76
an 0 311 76
honest 0 311 76
answering 0 311 76
of 0 311 76
the 0 311 76
question 0 311 76
“must 0 311 76
this 0 311 76
person’s 0 311 76
life 0 311 76
be 0 311 76
taken 0 311 76
to 0 311 76
preserve 0 311 76
society?” 0 311 76
The 1 311 76
desire 1 311 76
for 1 311 76
swift 1 311 76
and 1 311 76
firm 1 311 76
convictions 1 311 76
has 1 311 76
sent 1 311 76
many 1 311 76
to 1 311 76
death 1 311 76
who 1 311 76
never 1 311 76
deserved 1 311 76
such 1 311 76
a 1 311 76
punishment, 1 311 76
nor 1 311 76
was 1 311 76
such 1 311 76
a 1 311 76
punishment 1 311 76
truly 1 311 76
necessary 1 311 76
for 1 311 76
the 1 311 76
safety 1 311 76
of 1 311 76
society. 1 311 76

I 0 311 77
do 0 311 77
not 0 311 77
believe 0 311 77
the 0 311 77
death 0 311 77
penalty 0 311 77
is 0 311 77
necessary 0 311 77
in 0 311 77
90 0 311 77
percent 0 311 77
of 0 311 77
the 0 311 77
cases 0 311 77
where 0 311 77
it 0 311 77
is 0 311 77
applied. 0 311 77

Thus 0 311 78
to 0 311 78
call 0 311 78
for 0 311 78
a 0 311 78
moratorium 0 311 78

. 0 311 79

. 0 311 80

. 0 311 81
is 0 311 81
not 0 311 81
unjust 0 311 81
or 0 311 81
incorrect. 0 311 81

That 0 311 82
the 0 311 82
death 0 311 82
penalty 0 311 82
can 0 311 82
become 0 311 82
an 0 311 82
instrument 0 311 82
of 0 311 82
revenge, 0 311 82
and 0 311 82
that 0 311 82
unjust 0 311 82
sentences 0 311 82
are 0 311 82
sometimes 0 311 82
handed 0 311 82
down 0 311 82
can 0 311 82
be 0 311 82
dismissed 0 311 82
as 0 311 82
irrelevant 0 311 82
to 0 311 82
the 0 311 82
argument. 0 311 82

Given 0 311 83
the 1 311 83
fallen 1 311 83
human 1 311 83
condition, 1 311 83
such 1 311 83
injustices 1 311 83
are 1 311 83
bound 1 311 83
to 1 311 83
occur 1 311 83
in 1 311 83
any 1 311 83
judicial 1 311 83
system, 1 311 83
and 0 311 83
everyone 0 311 83
agrees 0 311 83
that 0 311 83
they 0 311 83
should 0 311 83
be 0 311 83
ruthlessly 1 311 83
remedied. 1 311 83

What 0 311 84
is 0 311 84
not 0 311 84
irrelevant 0 311 84
is 0 311 84
that 0 311 84
the 1 311 84
author 1 311 84
of 1 311 84
the 1 311 84
letter 1 311 84
falls 1 311 84
headlong 1 311 84
into 1 311 84
the 1 311 84
very 1 311 84
error 1 311 84
Pius 1 311 84

against. 1 311 84

the 0 311 85

he 0 311 85
feels 0 311 85
the 0 311 85

can 0 311 85
now 0 311 85

at 0 311 85

That 0 311 86
the 0 311 86

St. 0 311 123
Paul 0 311 123

declare, 0 311 123
the 0 311 123
old 0 311 123
penalty 0 311 123
remained 0 311 123
very 0 311 123
much 0 311 123
in 0 311 123
force: 0 311 123
“Almost 0 311 123
all 0 311 123

without 1 311 123
the 1 311 123
shedding 1 311 123
of 1 311 123
blood 1 311 123
there 1 311 123
is 1 311 123
no 1 311 123

It 0 311 123
is 0 311 123
still 0 311 123
“appointed 0 311 123

Christ 1 311 131

both 1 311 131
Scripture 1 311 131
and 1 311 131
tradition 1 311 131
testify 1 311 131
that 1 311 131
it 1 311 131

lawfully 1 311 131
wielded 1 311 131
by 1 311 131
those 1 311 131
to 1 311 131
whom 1 311 131
He 1 311 131

As 0 311 132
He 0 311 132
told 0 311 132
Pontius 0 311 132

at 0 311 132
the 0 311 132

His 0 311 132
trial, 0 311 132
“Thou 0 311 132

Pope 0 311 133
Leo 0 311 133

Sapientiae 0 311 133

in 0 311 133
1890, 0 311 133
when 0 311 133
he 0 311 133

that 0 311 133
“true 0 311 133

of 0 311 134
their 0 311 134
power, 0 311 134
it 0 311 134

death 0 311 134

if 0 311 135

As 0 311 135

St. 0 311 136
Paul 0 311 136
said: 0 311 136
Therefore 0 311 136

was 0 313 14
most 1 313 14

Amazingly, 1 87 5
the 0 87 5
surveillance 0 87 5

captured 0 87 5
what 0 87 5
seems 0 87 5
to 0 87 5

“large 0 87 5

The 0 87 9

of 0 87 12

the 0 87 13

(which 0 89 7
is 0 89 7
so 0 89 7
deadly 0 89 7
because 0 89 7
it 0 89 7
is 0 89 7
airborne) 0 89 7
could 1 89 7
mutate 1 89 7
and 1 89 7
become 1 89 7
untreatable 1 89 7
during 0 89 7
this 0 89 7
year’s 0 89 7
outbreak 0 89 7
– 0 89 7
which 0 89 7
is 0 89 7
expected 0 89 7
to 0 89 7
blight 0 89 7
Madagascar 0 89 7
until 0 89 7
April. 0 89 7

Others 0 89 8
worry 0 89 8
the 1 89 8
plague 1 89 8
will 1 89 8
go 1 89 8
beyond 1 89 8
mainland 0 89 8
Africa 0 89 8
and 0 89 8
eventually 0 89 8
reach 0 89 8
the 0 89 8
US, 0 89 8
Europe, 0 89 8
and 0 89 8
Britain. 0 89 8

The 0 89 9
plague 0 89 9
spreads 0 89 9
easily 0 89 9
and 0 89 9
can 0 89 9
kill 0 89 9
within 0 89 9
48 0 89 9
hours. 0 89 9

That 0 89 10
would 0 89 10
leave 1 89 10
millions 1 89 10
more 1 89 10
vulnerable 1 89 10
to 1 89 10
the 1 89 10

Paul 0 89 15

professor 0 89 15
of 0 89 15

protection 0 89 15
at 0 89 15

world-renowned 0 89 15
University 0 89 15
of 0 89 15
East 0 89 15
Anglia, 0 89 15
was 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
first 0 89 15
expert 0 89 15
to 0 89 15
predict 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
plague 0 89 15
could 0 89 15
travel 0 89 15
across 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
sea. 0 89 15

He 0 89 16
previously 0 89 16
said: 0 89 16
“The 0 89 16
big 0 89 16
anxiety 0 89 16
is 0 89 16
it 0 89 16
could 0 89 16
spread 0 89 16
to 0 89 16
mainland 0 89 16
Africa, 0 89 16
it’s 0 89 16
not 0 89 16
probable, 0 89 16
but 0 89 16
certainly 0 89 16
possible, 0 89 16
that 0 89 16
might 0 89 16
then 0 89 16
be 0 89 16
difficult 0 89 16
to 0 89 16
control. 0 89 16

If 1 89 17
we 1 89 17
don’t 1 89 17

on 1 89 17
doing 1 89 17

here, 1 89 17
at 1 89 17
one 1 89 17
point 1 89 17
something 1 89 17
will 1 89 17
happen 1 89 17
and 1 89 17
it 1 89 17
will 1 89 17
get 1 89 17
out 1 89 17
of 1 89 17
our 1 89 17
control 1 89 17
and 1 89 17
cause 1 89 17
huge 1 89 17
devastation 1 89 17
all 1 89 17
around 1 89 17
the 1 89 17
world.” 1 89 17
There 0 89 17
is 0 89 17
always 0 89 17
a 0 89 17
risk 0 89 17
with 0 89 17
travel 0 89 17
that 0 89 17
the 0 89 17
disease 1 89 17
will 1 89 17
spread 1 89 17
globally, 1 89 17
Hunter 0 89 17
added. 0 89 17

“We 0 89 18
don’t 0 89 18
want 0 89 18
a 0 89 18
situation 0 89 18
where 0 89 18
the 0 89 18
disease 0 89 18
spreads 0 89 18
so 0 89 18
fast 0 89 18
it 0 89 18
gets 0 89 18
out 0 89 18
of 0 89 18
control. 0 89 18

We 0 89 19
are 0 89 19
talking 0 89 19
about 0 89 19
it 0 89 19
spreading 0 89 19
in 0 89 19
days 0 89 19
rather 0 89 19
than 0 89 19
weeks.” 0 89 19
But 0 89 19
Hunter 0 89 19
is 0 89 19
adamant 0 89 19
that 0 89 19
a 0 89 19
well-developed 0 89 19
country 0 89 19
could 0 89 19
manage 0 89 19
the 0 89 19
plague 0 89 19
should 0 89 19
a 0 89 19
global 0 89 19
outbreak 0 89 19
occur. 0 89 19

Hopefully, 0 89 20
most 0 89 20
will 0 89 20
never 0 89 20
have 0 89 20
to 0 89 20
find 0 89 20
out 0 89 20
how 0 89 20
well 0 89 20
another 0 89 20
country 0 89 20
can 0 89 20
manage 0 89 20
this 0 89 20
infection. 0 89 20

A 0 89 21
few 0 89 21
health 0 89 21
experts 0 89 21
have 0 89 21
warned 0 89 21
that 0 89 21
there 0 89 21
is 0 89 21
no 0 89 21
threat 0 89 21
to 0 89 21
the 0 89 21
UK, 0 89 21
however, 0 89 21
some 1 89 21
have 1 89 21
warned 1 89 21
the 1 89 21
plague 1 89 21
outbreak 1 89 21
will 1 89 21
certainly 1 89 21
spread 1 89 21
to 1 89 21
the 1 89 21
region. 1 89 21

Richard 0 89 22

the 0 89 22
founder 0 89 22
of 0 89 22

Holiday, 0 89 22
has 0 89 22
sent 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
chilling 1 89 22
warning 1 89 22
to 0 89 22
UK 0 89 22
authorities. 0 89 22

Conway 0 89 23
is 0 89 23
saying 1 89 23
it’s 1 89 23
“only 1 89 23
a 1 89 23
matter 1 89 23
of 1 89 23
time” 1 89 23
before 1 89 23
the 1 89 23
disease 1 89 23
arrives 1 89 23
on 1 89 23
British 1 89 23
soil. 1 89 23

Conroy 0 89 24
warned 1 89 24
it 1 89 24
is 1 89 24
inevitable 1 89 24
that 1 89 24
the 1 89 24
plague 1 89 24
will 1 89 24
spread 1 89 24
due 0 89 24
to 0 89 24
the 0 89 24
vast 0 89 24
movement 0 89 24
of 0 89 24
people 0 89 24
across 0 89 24
the 0 89 24
globe. 0 89 24

“I 1 89 25
believe 1 89 25
that 1 89 25
it’s 1 89 25
100 1 89 25
percent 1 89 25
likely 1 89 25
that 1 89 25
plague 1 89 25
will 1 89 25
arrive 1 89 25
in 1 89 25
the 1 89 25
UK 1 89 25
once 1 89 25
more 1 89 25
– 1 89 25
it’s 1 89 25
just 1 89 25
a 1 89 25
question 1 89 25
of 1 89 25
‘when’, 1 89 25
not 1 89 25
‘if’. 1 89 25

And 0 89 26
it’s 0 89 26
not 0 89 26
an 0 89 26
exaggeration 0 89 26
to 0 89 26
say 0 89 26
that 0 89 26
this 0 89 26
is 0 89 26
a 0 89 26
real 0 89 26
threat 0 89 26
– 0 89 26
a 1 89 26
ticking 1 89 26
time 1 89 26
bomb 1 89 26
that’s 1 89 26
waiting 1 89 26
to 1 89 26
decimate 1 89 26

Conroy 0 89 26
continued. 0 89 26

“With 0 89 26

I 0 90 2

going 0 90 2
to 0 90 2
share 0 90 2
some 0 90 2
things 0 90 2
with 0 90 2
you 0 90 2
in 0 90 2
this 0 90 2
article 0 90 2
that 0 90 2
are 0 90 2
deeply 1 90 2
disturbing, 1 90 2
but 0 90 2
it 0 90 2
is 0 90 2
for 0 90 2
a 0 90 2
purpose. 0 90 2

The 0 90 3
status 0 90 3
quo 0 90 3
is 0 90 3
not 0 90 3
acceptable 0 90 3
in 0 90 3
Washington, 0 90 3
and 1 90 3
once 1 90 3
people 1 90 3
truly 1 90 3
understand 1 90 3
how 1 90 3
deep 1 90 3
the 1 90 3
corruaption 1 90 3
runs 1 90 3
I 1 90 3
believe 1 90 3
that 1 90 3
they 1 90 3
will 1 90 3
get 1 90 3
motivated 1 90 3
to 1 90 3
finally 1 90 3
drain 1 90 3

So 0 90 4
yes, 0 90 4
I 0 90 4

in 0 90 4
this 0 90 4
article 0 90 4
that 0 90 4
are 0 90 4
truly 1 90 4
disgusting, 1 90 4
but 0 90 4
the 0 90 4
goal 0 90 4
is 0 90 4
to 0 90 4
show 0 90 4
you 0 90 4
that 0 90 4
it 1 90 4
is 1 90 4
time 1 90 4
to 1 90 4
take 1 90 4
our 1 90 4

back 1 90 4
from 1 90 4
the 1 90 4

Another 0 90 13
has 1 90 13
exposed 1 90 13
his 1 90 13

and 0 90 13
some 0 90 13

Here 0 90 28

the 0 90 28

the 0 90 30

it 0 90 30
was 0 90 30
a 0 90 30
young 0 90 30

It 0 90 31
was 0 90 31
a 0 90 31
male, 0 90 31
who 0 90 31
then 0 90 31
invited 0 90 31
her 0 90 31
in. 0 90 31

And 0 90 32
at 0 90 32
that 0 90 32
point, 0 90 32
he 0 90 32

Of 0 90 35
course, 0 90 35
this 0 90 35
sort 0 90 35
of 0 90 35

An 0 90 37
ex-Secret 0 90 37

“Weinstein-level” 1 90 37

assault 1 90 37
and 0 90 37
that 0 90 37
he 0 90 37
would 0 90 37
walk 0 90 37
around 0 90 37
the 0 90 37

completely 1 90 37

spoke 0 90 38
on 0 90 38
condition 0 90 38
of 0 90 38
anonymity 0 90 38
revealed 0 90 38
that 0 90 38
Biden 0 90 38
“would 1 90 38
mess 1 90 38

that 0 90 38
a 0 90 38

get-together 0 90 38
at 0 90 38
the 0 90 38

In 0 90 39
fact, 0 90 39
things 0 90 39
were 0 90 39
so 0 90 39
bad 0 90 39

got 0 90 39
into 0 90 39
a 0 90 39

An 0 94 2
expert 0 94 2
is 0 94 2
warning 1 94 2
the 1 94 2
plague 1 94 2
that 1 94 2
has 1 94 2
sickened 1 94 2
over 1 94 2
2000 1 94 2
people 1 94 2
in 1 94 2
Madagascar 1 94 2
since 1 94 2
August 1 94 2
is 1 94 2
impossible 1 94 2

Even 0 94 3
though 0 94 3
the 0 94 3
number 0 94 3
of 0 94 3
those 0 94 3
infected 0 94 3
has 0 94 3
dropped 0 94 3
in 0 94 3
recent 0 94 3
weeks, 0 94 3
the 1 94 3
plague 1 94 3
will 1 94 3
never 1 94 3
truly 1 94 3
be 1 94 3
gone. 1 94 3

Since 0 94 4
the 0 94 4
airborne 0 94 4
version 0 94 4
of 0 94 4
the 0 94 4
plague 0 94 4
can 0 94 4
kill 0 94 4
a 0 94 4
person 0 94 4
in 0 94 4
just 0 94 4
three 0 94 4
hours, 0 94 4
experts 0 94 4
warn 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
its 0 94 4
too 0 94 4
soon 0 94 4
to 0 94 4
think 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
since 0 94 4
there 0 94 4
hasn’t 0 94 4
been 0 94 4
a 0 94 4
person 0 94 4
infected 0 94 4
in 0 94 4
recent 0 94 4

that 0 94 4
it 0 94 4
won’t 0 94 4
pop 0 94 4
up 0 94 4
again. 0 94 4

That’s 0 94 5
because 0 94 5
the 1 94 5
bacteria 1 94 5
that 1 94 5
causes 1 94 5
plague 1 94 5
is 1 94 5

so 1 94 5

The 0 98 9
main 0 98 9
difference 0 98 9
between 0 98 9
asteroids 0 98 9
and 0 98 9
comets 0 98 9
is 0 98 9
their 0 98 9
composition. 0 98 9

Asteroids 0 98 10
are 0 98 10
made 0 98 10
up 0 98 10
of 0 98 10
metals 0 98 10
and 0 98 10
rocky 0 98 10
material, 0 98 10
while 0 98 10
comets 0 98 10
are 0 98 10
made 0 98 10
up 0 98 10
of 0 98 10
ice, 0 98 10
dust 0 98 10
and 0 98 10
rocky 0 98 10
material. 0 98 10

Comets 0 98 11
which 0 98 11
approach 0 98 11
the 0 98 11
Sun 0 98 11
lose 0 98 11
material 0 98 11
with 0 98 11
each 0 98 11
orbit 0 98 11
because 0 98 11
some 0 98 11
of 0 98 11
their 0 98 11
ice 0 98 11
melts 0 98 11
and 0 98 11
vaporizes 0 98 11
to 0 98 11
form 0 98 11
a 0 98 11
tail. 0 98 11

But 0 98 12
the 0 98 12
real 0 98 12
question 0 98 12
is 0 98 12
will 0 98 12
anyone 0 98 12
be 0 98 12
able 0 98 12
to 0 98 12

the 0 98 12

close 0 98 12
approach 0 98 12
to 0 98 12
our 0 98 12
planet. 0 98 12

According 0 98 13
to 0 98 13
NASA, 0 98 13
3200 0 98 13
Phaethon 0 98 13
will 0 98 13
be 0 98 13

in 0 98 13
areas 0 98 13
with 0 98 13
dark 0 98 13
skies. 0 98 13

It 0 98 14
is 0 98 14
potentially 0 98 14
detectable 0 98 14
for 0 98 14
three 0 98 14
weeks 0 98 14

will 0 98 14

it 0 100 15
“just 1 100 15

one 0 100 18

He 0 100 19
said 0 100 19
it 0 100 19
was 0 100 19
wrapped 0 100 19

and 0 100 19
when 0 100 19

it, 0 100 19
the 0 100 19

he 0 100 21
stepped 0 100 21
on 0 100 21

causing 0 100 21
it 0 100 21

the 0 101 1
reviewing 0 101 1
of 0 101 1
those 0 101 1
cases. 0 101 1

At 0 101 2
issue 0 101 2
is 0 101 2
a 0 101 2
large 0 101 2
group 0 101 2
of 0 101 2
Indonesian 0 101 2
Chinese 0 101 2
Christians 0 101 2
who 0 101 2
fled 0 101 2
a 0 101 2
pogrom 1 101 2
in 0 101 2
Indonesia 0 101 2
directed 0 101 2
against 0 101 2
them 0 101 2
in 0 101 2
the 0 101 2
1990s. 0 101 2

The 0 101 3
Chinese 0 101 3
generally 0 101 3
filed 0 101 3
asylum 0 101 3
applications 0 101 3
after 0 101 3
arriving 0 101 3
in 0 101 3
the 0 101 3
United 0 101 3
States, 0 101 3
and, 0 101 3
importantly, 0 101 3
not 0 101 3
at 0 101 3
an 0 101 3
American 0 101 3
embassy 0 101 3
or 0 101 3
consulate 0 101 3
in 0 101 3
Indonesia 0 101 3
or 0 101 3
nearby. 0 101 3

All 0 101 4
were 0 101 4
relatively 0 101 4
wealthy 0 101 4
and 0 101 4
had 0 101 4
or 0 101 4
obtained 0 101 4
tourist 0 101 4
visas 0 101 4
to 0 101 4
the 0 101 4
United 0 101 4
States. 0 101 4

This 0 101 5
is 0 101 5
important 0 101 5
as 0 101 5
most 0 101 5
actual 0 101 5
"refugees" 0 101 5
drop 0 101 5
everything 0 101 5
to 0 101 5
flee 0 101 5

are 0 101 5
under 0 101 5
threat 0 101 5
of 0 101 5
death. 0 101 5

Tellingly, 1 101 6
these 1 101 6
asylum 1 101 6
applicants 1 101 6
were 1 101 6
the 1 101 6
elite 1 101 6
of 1 101 6
Indonesian 1 101 6
society, 1 101 6
because 1 101 6
their 1 101 6
higher 1 101 6
average 1 101 6
IQ, 1 101 6
than 1 101 6
the 1 101 6
rather 1 101 6
dull 1 101 6
Indonesians. 1 101 6

87 0 101 7

the 0 101 7
average 0 101 7
Indonesian 0 101 7
IQ 0 101 7
, 0 101 7
and 0 101 7
note 0 101 7
that 0 101 7
average 0 101 7
includes 0 101 7
the 0 101 7
higher 0 101 7
average 0 101 7
Chinese, 0 101 7
so 1 101 7
the 1 101 7
locals 1 101 7
really 1 101 7
are 1 101 7
a 1 101 7
dull 1 101 7
lot. 1 101 7

This 0 101 8
is 0 101 8

violence, 0 101 8
the 0 101 8
non-Chinese 0 101 8
Christians 0 101 8
mostly 0 101 8
stuck 0 101 8
around, 0 101 8
though 0 101 8

secure 0 101 8
their 0 101 8
wealth 0 101 8
in 0 101 8

the 0 101 9

was 0 101 9

duration 0 101 9

came 1 101 12
to 1 101 12
an 1 101 12
inglorious 1 101 12
end. 1 101 12

And 0 101 13
end 0 101 13
it 0 101 13
was 0 101 13
for 0 101 13
this 0 101 13
particular 0 101 13
lot 0 101 13
of 0 101 13

But 0 101 14
Kritarch 0 101 14
Patti 0 101 14

was 0 101 14
having 0 101 14

of 0 101 14

She 0 101 15
thought 0 101 15
she 0 101 15
was 0 101 15
decider-in-chief 1 101 15
on 1 101 15
who 1 101 15

And 0 101 16
all 0 101 16
on 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
flimsy 0 101 16
excuse 0 101 16
that 0 101 16
the 0 101 16

need 0 101 16
another 1 101 16

despite 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
clear 0 101 16
fact 0 101 16
that 0 101 16
the 0 101 16
Indonesian 0 101 16
government 0 101 16
had 0 101 16
long 0 101 16
ago 0 101 16
quashed 0 101 16
the 0 101 16

directed 0 101 16
against 0 101 16

the 0 101 16
religious 0 101 16
motivated 0 101 16
violence 0 101 16
against 0 101 16
Christians. 0 101 16

While 0 101 17
there 0 101 17
are 0 101 17
a 0 101 17
couple 0 101 17
of 0 101 17
provinces 0 101 17
in 0 101 17
Indonesia 0 101 17
that 0 101 17
impose 0 101 17
Sharia 0 101 17

on 0 101 17
Muslims, 0 101 17
most 0 101 17
non-Muslims 0 101 17
are 0 101 17
exempt. 0 101 17

As 0 101 18
moderates 0 101 18
go, 0 101 18
Indonesia 0 101 18
is 0 101 18
about 0 101 18
as 0 101 18
close 0 101 18
as 0 101 18
it 0 101 18
gets 0 101 18
to 0 101 18
moderate 0 101 18
Muslims. 0 101 18

Mostly 0 101 19
because 0 101 19
the 1 101 19
country 1 101 19
would 1 101 19
not 1 101 19

an 1 101 21

just 1 101 21

Indonesia 0 101 31

hospitable 0 101 31
to 0 101 31
Chinese 0 101 31

today 0 101 31
than 0 101 31
the 0 101 31
short 0 101 31

in 0 101 31
the 0 101 31

there 0 101 31
was 0 101 31
a 0 101 31
problem. 0 101 31

But 0 101 32
basically, 0 101 32
Saris 0 101 32
wants 0 101 32
the 0 101 32

wants 0 101 33
these 0 101 33

to 0 101 33
never 0 101 33

That, 0 101 34
of 0 101 34

is 0 101 34
not 0 101 34

The 0 101 35
only 0 101 35

before 0 101 35
a 0 101 35

is 0 101 35
if 0 101 35
they 0 101 35
got 0 101 35
the 0 101 35
due 0 101 35
process 0 101 35
that 0 101 35
Congress 0 101 35
gave 0 101 35
those 0 101 35
illegal 1 101 35
aliens. 1 101 35

And 0 101 36
they 0 101 36
did, 0 101 36
they 0 101 36
filed 0 101 36
for 0 101 36
asylum, 0 101 36
had 0 101 36
a 0 101 36

that 0 103 7
Pope 0 103 7
Francis 0 103 7
expressly 0 103 7
intends 0 103 7
both 0 103 7

the 0 103 7

bear 0 103 7
the 0 103 7
character 0 103 7
of 0 103 7
his 0 103 7
"authentic 0 103 7

Hence 0 103 8
Amoris 0 103 8
Laetitia 0 103 8
VIII, 0 103 8
which 0 103 8
proposes 0 103 8
that 0 103 8

living 0 103 8
in 0 103 8
adultery 0 103 8
can 0 103 8
be 0 103 8
guiltless 0 103 8
and 0 103 8
thus 0 103 8
be 0 103 8
admitted 0 103 8
to 0 103 8
the 0 103 8
sacraments 0 103 8
of 0 103 8
Confession 0 103 8
and 0 103 8
Communion 0 103 8
when 0 103 8
"concrete 0 103 8
circumstances" 0 103 8
make 0 103 8
it 0 103 8
difficult 0 103 8
to 0 103 8
renounce 0 103 8
their 0 103 8
adulterous 0 103 8
state, 0 103 8
is 0 103 8
now 0 103 8
declared 0 103 8
"magisterial" 0 103 8
by 0 103 8
the 0 103 8
Holy 0 103 8
See. 0 103 8

The 0 103 9
problem 0 103 9
with 0 103 9
this 0 103 9
is 0 103 9
that 0 103 9
heresy 0 103 9
or 0 103 9
sacrilege 0 103 9
can 0 103 9
never 0 103 9
be 0 103 9
declared 0 103 9
magisterial, 0 103 9
so 0 103 9
that 0 103 9
if 0 103 9
it 0 103 9
is, 0 103 9
it 0 103 9
not 0 103 9
only 0 103 9
has 0 103 9
no 0 103 9
binding 0 103 9
force, 0 103 9
but 0 103 9
the 0 103 9
faithful 0 103 9
are 0 103 9
obliged 0 103 9
to 0 103 9
resist 0 103 9
and 0 103 9
refute 0 103 9
such 0 103 9
a 0 103 9
declaration. 0 103 9

St. 0 103 10
Thomas 0 103 10
Aquinas 0 103 10
says 0 103 10
in 0 103 10
his 0 103 10
Summa 0 103 10
Theologiae: 0 103 10
"If 0 103 10
the 0 103 10
faith 0 103 10
were 0 103 10
endangered, 0 103 10
a 0 103 10
subject 0 103 10
ought 0 103 10
to 0 103 10
rebuke 0 103 10
his 0 103 10
prelate 0 103 10
[pope] 0 103 10
even 0 103 10
publicly." 0 103 10

The 0 103 11
fact 0 103 11
is 0 103 11
that 0 103 11
this 0 103 11
latest 0 103 11
promulgation 0 103 11
is 0 103 11
counter-magisterial, 0 103 11

pope 0 103 11
and 0 103 11
his 0 103 11
right-hand 0 103 11

now 0 103 11

support 0 103 11
from 0 103 11

dissenting 0 103 11

Each 0 103 25

we 0 103 25
see 0 103 25

the 0 104 5

So 0 104 21
observers 0 104 21
have 0 104 21
grounds 0 104 21
to 0 104 21

that 0 104 21

both 0 104 21
got 0 104 21

wanted. 0 104 21

Garcia 0 104 22

the 0 104 22
court 0 104 22
Zarate 0 104 22
was 0 104 22
playing 0 104 22
his 0 104 22

“secret 1 104 22
version 1 104 22
of 1 104 22
Russian 1 104 22
roulette,” 1 104 22
and 0 104 22
thus 0 104 22
parroted 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
defense’s 0 104 22
contention 0 104 22
that 0 104 22
the 0 104 22

all 0 104 22
a 0 104 22

chance. 0 104 22

As 0 104 23
it 0 104 23
happens, 0 104 23
in 0 104 23

a 0 104 23

revolver, 0 104 23
spins 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
cylinder, 0 104 23
then 0 104 23
puts 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
gun 0 104 23
to 0 104 23
his 0 104 23
own 0 104 23
head 0 104 23
and 0 104 23
pulls 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
trigger. 0 104 23

In 0 104 24
a 0 104 24
central 0 104 24
fact 0 104 24
of 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
case, 0 104 24
Zarate 0 104 24
did 0 104 24
not 0 104 24
aim 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
gun 0 104 24
at 0 104 24
himself 0 104 24
but 0 104 24
fired 0 104 24
in 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
direction 0 104 24
of 0 104 24
Kate 0 104 24
Steinle. 0 104 24

In 0 104 25
another 0 104 25

the 0 104 25
bullet 0 104 25

her 0 104 25
in 0 104 25
the 0 104 25

tore 0 104 25
through 0 104 25
her 0 104 25
abdominal 0 104 25
aorta. 0 104 25

This 0 104 26
happened 0 104 26

had 0 104 27
gunpowder 0 104 27
residue 0 104 27
on 0 104 27
his 0 104 27
hands. 0 104 27

After 0 104 28
firing, 0 104 28
he 0 104 28
tossed 0 104 28
the 0 104 28
gun 0 104 28
in 0 104 28
the 0 104 28
water. 0 104 28

He 0 104 29
said 0 104 29
he 0 104 29
had 0 104 29
found 0 104 29
the 0 104 29
stolen 0 104 29
weapon 0 104 29
wrapped 0 104 29
in 0 104 29
a 0 104 29

and 0 104 29
that 0 104 29
it 0 104 29
discharged 0 104 29
by 0 104 29
itself, 0 104 29
both 0 104 29
utterly 0 104 29
unbelievable 0 104 29
claims. 0 104 29

Even 0 104 30
so, 0 104 30
the 0 104 30
politically 0 104 30
correct 0 104 30
jury 0 104 30
found 0 104 30
the 0 104 30
career 0 104 30
criminal 0 104 30
not 0 104 30
guilty 0 104 30
of 0 104 30
murder 0 104 30
and 0 104 30
manslaughter. 0 104 30

Any 0 104 31
observer 0 104 31
could 0 104 31
be 0 104 31
forgiven 0 104 31
for 0 104 31
believing 0 104 31
that 0 104 31
prosecution 0 104 31
and 0 104 31
defense 0 104 31
both 0 104 31
got 0 104 31
the 0 104 31
outcome 0 104 31
they 0 104 31
wanted. 0 104 31

Unlike 1 104 32
Stalin’s 1 104 32
trials 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
old 1 104 32
Bolsheviks, 1 104 32
and 1 104 32
Fidel 1 104 32
Castro’ 1 104 32
trial 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
General 1 104 32
Arnaldo 1 104 32
Ochoa, 1 104 32
this 1 104 32
show 1 104 32
trial 1 104 32
aimed 1 104 32
to 1 104 32
establish 1 104 32
innocence 1 104 32
for 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
guilty, 1 104 32
and 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
dynamics 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
left 1 104 32
were 1 104 32
on 1 104 32
full 1 104 32
display. 1 104 32

Denunciations 0 104 33
of 0 104 33
“gun 0 104 33
violence” 0 104 33
were 0 104 33
nowhere 0 104 33
in 0 104 33
evidence 0 104 33
and 0 104 33
expressions 0 104 33
of 0 104 33
sympathy 0 104 33
for 0 104 33
the 0 104 33
Steinle 0 104 33
family 0 104 33
proved 0 104 33
pathetically 0 104 33
weak. 0 104 33

As 0 104 34
Arthur 0 104 34
Koestler 0 104 34
said, 0 104 34
on 0 104 34
the 0 104 34
left 0 104 34
the 0 104 34
truth 0 104 34
is 0 104 34
spoken 0 104 34
with 0 104 34
loathing 0 104 34
and 0 104 34
falsehood 0 104 34
with 0 104 34
love. 0 104 34

On 0 104 35
the 0 104 35
left, 0 104 35
as 0 104 35
Orwell 0 104 35
had 0 104 35

Animal 0 104 35

rats 0 104 35
are 0 104 35
comrades, 0 104 35
and 0 104 35
criminals 0 104 35
are 0 104 35
victims 0 104 35
of 0 104 35
capitalist 0 104 35
society. 0 104 35

In 0 104 36
the 0 104 36
view 0 104 36
of 0 104 36
Gonzalez, 0 104 36
society 1 104 36
is 1 104 36
progressing 1 104 36
toward 1 104 36
a 1 104 36
social 1 104 36
justice 1 104 36
paradise 1 104 36
ruled 1 104 36
by 1 104 36
a 1 104 36
wise 1 104 36
elite 1 104 36
that 1 104 36
knows 1 104 36
what’s 1 104 36
best 1 104 36
for 1 104 36
all. 1 104 36

In 0 104 37
this 0 104 37
inexorable 0 104 37
progress, 0 104 37
determined 0 104 37
by 0 104 37
history, 0 104 37
some 0 104 37
people 0 104 37
are 0 104 37
going 0 104 37
to 0 104 37
have 0 104 37
to 0 104 37
die. 0 104 37

As 1 104 38
Bertolt 1 104 38
Brecht 1 104 38
told 1 104 38
Sidney 1 104 38
Hook 1 104 38
about 1 104 38
Stalin’s 1 104 38
victims, 1 104 38
“the 1 104 38
more 1 104 38
innocent 1 104 38
they 1 104 38
are, 1 104 38
the 1 104 38
more 1 104 38
they 1 104 38
deserve 1 104 38
to 1 104 38
be 1 104 38
shot.” 1 104 38

a 0 104 39
friend, 0 104 39
Kate 0 104 39
Steinle 0 104 39
was 0 104 39
a 0 104 39
completely 0 104 39
innocent 0 104 39
victim, 0 104 39
gunned 0 104 39
down 0 104 39
by 0 104 39
a 0 104 39
career 0 104 39
criminal 0 104 39
who 0 104 39
was 0 104 39
not 0 104 39
even 0 104 39
supposed 0 104 39
to 0 104 39
be 0 104 39
in 0 104 39
the 0 104 39
country 0 104 39
but 0 104 39
found 0 104 39
special 0 104 39
protection 0 104 39
in 0 104 39
the 0 104 39

California. 0 104 39

As 0 104 40
defense 0 104 40
attorney 0 104 40
Francisco 0 104 40
Ugarte 0 104 40
said, 0 104 40
the 0 104 40
verdict 0 104 40
was 0 104 40
a 0 104 40
“vindication 0 104 40
for 0 104 40
the 0 104 40
rights 0 104 40
of 0 104 40
immigrants.” 0 104 40

Since 0 104 41
Donald 0 104 41
Trump 0 104 41
mentioned 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
case, 0 104 41
former 0 104 41
vice-presidential 0 104 41
candidate 0 104 41
Matt 0 104 41
Gonzalez 0 104 41

to 0 104 41
establish 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
complete 0 104 41
innocence 0 104 41
of 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
shooter. 0 104 41

That 1 104 42
explains 1 104 42
the 1 104 42
effort 1 104 42
of 1 104 42
“The 1 104 42

Any 0 104 42

The 1 105 8

even 0 105 8
feels 0 105 8
at 0 105 8

But 0 105 9
now 0 105 9
we 0 105 9
are 0 105 9
witness 0 105 9
to 0 105 9

the 0 105 9

The 0 105 10
Church 0 105 10
has 0 105 10
seen 0 105 10
a 0 105 10
number 0 105 10
of 0 105 10
Popes 0 105 10
who 0 105 10
have 0 105 10
abused 0 105 10
their 0 105 10
power, 0 105 10
Alexander 0 105 10
VI 0 105 10
being 0 105 10
the 0 105 10
most 0 105 10

known 0 105 10
example. 0 105 10

But 1 105 11
never, 1 105 11
before 1 105 11
Francis, 1 105 11
has 1 105 11
there 1 105 11
been 1 105 11
a 1 105 11
Pope 1 105 11
who 1 105 11
dared 1 105 11
to 1 105 11
tyrannize 1 105 11
the 1 105 11
Magisterium 1 105 11
itself 1 105 11
by 1 105 11
attempting 1 105 11
to 1 105 11

Francis 0 105 12
has 0 105 12
officially 0 105 12

that 0 105 12
the 0 105 12
“authentic 0 105 12

includes 0 105 12
the 0 105 12

of 0 105 12

(AL), 0 105 12
which 0 105 12
he 0 105 12
expressly 0 105 12
approved 0 105 12
in 0 105 12
his 0 105 12
letter 0 105 12
to 0 105 12
them 0 105 12
as 0 105 12
the 0 105 12
only 0 105 12
correct 0 105 12
interpretation 0 105 12
of 0 105 12
his 0 105 12

The 0 105 13
guidelines 0 105 13
have 0 105 13
been 0 105 13
published 0 105 13
in 0 105 13
the 0 105 13
AAS 0 105 13
along 0 105 13
with 0 105 13
Francis’s 0 105 13
private 0 105 13
missive, 0 105 13
which 0 105 13
is 0 105 13
suddenly 0 105 13
declared 0 105 13
to 0 105 13
be 0 105 13
“an 0 105 13
apostolic 0 105 13
letter.” 0 105 13

The 0 105 14
normalist 0 105 14
narrative 0 105 14
has 0 105 14
just 0 105 14
been 0 105 14
stripped 0 105 14
of 0 105 14
any 0 105 14
colorable 0 105 14
argument 0 105 14
that 0 105 14
nothing 0 105 14
is 0 105 14
too 0 105 14
terribly 0 105 14
amiss 0 105 14
with 0 105 14
this 0 105 14
pontificate. 0 105 14

We 0 105 15
are 0 105 15
now 0 105 15
expected 0 105 15
to 0 105 15
believe 0 105 15
that 0 105 15
the 0 105 15
“authentic 0 105 15
Magisterium”—meaning 0 105 15
simply 0 105 15
and 0 105 15
only 0 105 15
AL—teaches 0 105 15
what 0 105 15
the 0 105 15
guidelines 0 105 15
preposterously 0 105 15
declare, 0 105 15
solely 0 105 15
in 0 105 15
reliance 0 105 15
on 0 105 15
AL: 0 105 15

When 0 105 16
the 0 105 16
concrete 0 105 16
circumstances 0 105 16
of 0 105 16
a 0 105 16
couple 0 105 16
make 0 105 16
it 0 105 16
feasible, 0 105 16
especially 0 105 16
when 0 105 16
both 0 105 16
are 0 105 16
Christians 0 105 16
with 0 105 16
a 0 105 16
journey 0 105 16
of 0 105 16
faith, 0 105 16
one 0 105 16
may 0 105 16
propose 0 105 16
that 0 105 16
they 0 105 16
commit 0 105 16
to 0 105 16
living 0 105 16
in 0 105 16
continence…. 0 105 16

In 0 105 17
other 0 105 17
more 0 105 17
complex 0 105 17
circumstances, 0 105 17
and 0 105 17
when 0 105 17
it 0 105 17
is 0 105 17
not 0 105 17
possible 0 105 17
to 0 105 17
obtain 0 105 17
a 0 105 17
declaration 0 105 17
of 0 105 17
nullity, 0 105 17
the 0 105 17
aforementioned 0 105 17
option 0 105 17
may 0 105 17
not, 0 105 17
in 0 105 17
fact, 0 105 17
be 0 105 17
viable. 0 105 17

Nonetheless, 0 105 18
it 0 105 18
is 0 105 18
equally 0 105 18
possible 0 105 18
to 0 105 18
undertake 0 105 18
a 0 105 18
journey 0 105 18
of 0 105 18
discernment…. 0 105 18

[I]f 0 105 19
one 0 105 19

at 0 105 19
the 0 105 19
recognition 0 105 19
that, 0 105 19
in 0 105 19
a 0 105 19
concrete 0 105 19
case, 0 105 19
there 0 105 19
are 0 105 19
limitations 0 105 19
that 0 105 19

responsibility 0 105 19
and 0 105 19
culpability 0 105 19
(cf. 0 105 19

301-302), 0 105 20
particularly 0 105 20
when 0 105 20
a 0 105 20
person 0 105 20
judges 0 105 20
that 0 105 20
he 0 105 20
would 0 105 20
fall 0 105 20
into 0 105 20
a 0 105 20
subsequent 0 105 20
fault 0 105 20
by 0 105 20
damaging 0 105 20
the 0 105 20
children 0 105 20
of 0 105 20
the 0 105 20
new 0 105 20
union, 0 105 20
Amoris 0 105 20
Laetitia 0 105 20
opens 0 105 20
up 0 105 20
the 0 105 20
possibility 0 105 20
of 0 105 20
access 0 105 20

As 0 105 22
Francis 0 105 22
would 0 105 22
have 0 105 22
it, 0 105 22
then, 0 105 22
the 0 105 22
“authentic 0 105 22

has 0 105 22
just 0 105 22
flatly 0 105 22
contradicted 0 105 22
itself 0 105 22
for 0 105 22
the 0 105 22

now 0 105 23
deemed 0 105 23
possible 0 105 23

is, 0 105 23
situation 0 105 23

Francis, 0 105 32
however, 0 105 32
has 0 105 32
purported 0 105 32
to 0 105 32
do 0 105 32
nothing 0 105 32

invent 0 105 32

the 0 105 32
doctrine 0 105 32
of 0 105 32
the 0 105 32
Church. 0 105 32

The 0 105 33
attempt 0 105 33
is 0 105 33
void, 0 105 33
of 0 105 33
course, 0 105 33
and 0 105 33
the 0 105 33
appellation 0 105 33
“authentic 0 105 33
Magisterium” 0 105 33
is 0 105 33
fraudulent. 0 105 33

But 0 105 34
the 0 105 34
consequences 0 105 34
of 0 105 34
this 0 105 34
Pope’s 0 105 34
toying 1 105 34
with 1 105 34
the 1 105 34
teaching 1 105 34
office 1 105 34
of 0 105 34
the 0 105 34
Church 0 105 34
to 0 105 34
advance 0 105 34
half-baked 1 105 34
theological 1 105 34
notions, 1 105 34
such 0 105 34
as 0 105 34
“discernment” 0 105 34
(a 0 105 34
term 0 105 34
he 0 105 34

St. 0 105 34

of 0 105 34
Loyola 0 105 34
but 0 105 34
strips 0 105 34
of 0 105 34
its 0 105 34
original 0 105 34
meaning) 0 105 34
are 0 105 34
catastrophic. 0 105 34

Over 0 105 35
the 0 105 35
past 0 105 35
year, 0 105 35
Cardinal 0 105 35
Burke 0 105 35
and 0 105 35
a 0 105 35
few 0 105 35
other 0 105 35
members 0 105 35
of 0 105 35
the 0 105 35
hierarchy 0 105 35
have 0 105 35
called 0 105 35
upon 0 105 35
Francis 0 105 35
to 0 105 35
“clarify” 0 105 35
his 0 105 35
intention 0 105 35
respecting 0 105 35
AL. 0 105 35

That 0 105 36
clarification 0 105 36
has 0 105 36
now 0 105 36
been 0 105 36
given: 0 105 36
Francis 0 105 36
intends, 0 105 36
if 0 105 36
it 0 105 36
were 0 105 36
possible, 0 105 36
to 0 105 36
change 0 105 36
the 0 105 36
unchangeable 0 105 36
teaching 0 105 36
of 0 105 36
the 0 105 36
Church 0 105 36
regarding 0 105 36
an 0 105 36
irrevocable 0 105 36
moral 0 105 36
norm 0 105 36
rooted 0 105 36
in 0 105 36
divine 0 105 36
law. 0 105 36

Even 1 105 37
if 1 105 37
the 1 105 37
attempt 1 105 37
is 1 105 37
void 1 105 37
and 1 105 37
of 1 105 37
no 1 105 37
effect 1 105 37
before 1 105 37
man 1 105 37
and 1 105 37
God—an 1 105 37
immoral 1 105 37
law 1 105 37
is 1 105 37
no 1 105 37
law 1 105 37
at 1 105 37
all—Francis 0 105 37
clearly 0 105 37
means 0 105 37
to 0 105 37
impose 0 105 37
his 0 105 37
will 0 105 37
by 0 105 37
fiat, 0 105 37
daring 0 105 37
invoke 0 105 37
the 0 105 37
“authentic 0 105 37
Magisterium” 0 105 37
to 0 105 37
cloak 1 105 37
his 1 105 37
absurd 1 105 37
novelties. 1 105 37

No 1 105 38
Pope 1 105 38
before 1 105 38
him 1 105 38
has 1 105 38
ever 1 105 38
dared 1 105 38
to 1 105 38
do 1 105 38
such 1 105 38
a 1 105 38
thing. 1 105 38

So 0 105 39
now 0 105 39
it 0 105 39
must 0 105 39
be 0 105 39
asked: 0 105 39
Where 0 105 39
are 0 105 39
the 0 105 39
cardinals 0 105 39
and 0 105 39
the 0 105 39
bishops? 0 105 39

With 0 105 40
one 0 105 40
or 0 105 40
two 0 105 40
noble 0 105 40
(however 0 105 40
inconsistent) 0 105 40
exceptions, 0 105 40
their 0 105 40
response 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Bergoglian 0 105 40
Debacle 0 105 40
thus 0 105 40
far 0 105 40
ranges 0 105 40
from 0 105 40
silence, 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
active 0 105 40
complicity, 0 105 40
to—at 0 105 40
best—hand-wringing 0 105 40
over 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
increasingly 0 105 40
chaotic 0 105 40
state 0 105 40
of 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Church 0 105 40
while 0 105 40
begging 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Pope 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
“clarify” 0 105 40
his 0 105 40
already 0 105 40
perfectly 0 105 40
clear 0 105 40
intentions. 0 105 40

At 0 105 41
this 0 105 41
point, 0 105 41
continued 0 105 41
pleading 0 105 41
for 0 105 41
a 0 105 41
Bergoglian 0 105 41
“clarification” 0 105 41
can 0 105 41
only 0 105 41
give 0 105 41
rise 0 105 41
to 0 105 41
an 0 105 41
impression 0 105 41
of 0 105 41
disingenuousness, 0 105 41
whereas 0 105 41
continued 0 105 41
silence 0 105 41
about 0 105 41
the 0 105 41
papal 0 105 41
origin 0 105 41
of 0 105 41
this 0 105 41
ongoing 0 105 41
catastrophe 0 105 41
is 1 105 41
a 1 105 41
standing 1 105 41
rebuke 1 105 41
to 1 105 41
all 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
hierarchs 1 105 41
who 1 105 41
know 1 105 41
what 1 105 41
we 1 105 41
all 1 105 41
know: 1 105 41
that 1 105 41
at 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
epicenter 1 105 41
of 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
chaos 1 105 41
is 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
most 1 105 41
wayward 1 105 41
Pope 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
Church 1 105 41
has 1 105 41
ever 1 105 41
had 1 105 41
to 1 105 41
endure. 1 105 41

Continued 1 105 42
inaction 1 105 42
while 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
laity 1 105 42
and 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
few 1 105 42
good 1 105 42
priests 1 105 42
are 1 105 42
left 1 105 42
to 1 105 42
themselves 1 105 42
to 1 105 42
defend, 1 105 42
as 1 105 42
best 1 105 42
they 1 105 42
can, 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
constant 1 105 42
teaching 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Church 1 105 42
against 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
abuses 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
tyrant 1 105 42
on 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Chair 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
Peter 1 105 42
threatens 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
hierarchs 1 105 42
with 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
legacy 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
shame 1 105 42
and 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
terrible 1 105 42
accountability 1 105 42
before 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Just 1 105 42
Judge. 1 105 42

Their 0 105 43
failure 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
defend 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Faith 0 105 43
by 0 105 43
standing 0 105 43
up 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
one 0 105 43
they 0 105 43
know 0 105 43
full 0 105 43
well 0 105 43
is 0 105 43
attacking 0 105 43
it 0 105 43
almost 0 105 43
daily 0 105 43
lends 0 105 43
itself 0 105 43
ever 0 105 43
more 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
an 0 105 43
indictment 0 105 43
for 0 105 43
timidity 0 105 43
in 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
face 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
unprecedented 0 105 43
danger 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Church 0 105 43
and 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
cause 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Gospel 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
which 0 105 43
they 0 105 43
are 0 105 43
divinely 0 105 43
charged 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
be 0 105 43
leaders. 0 105 43

The 1 105 44
time 1 105 44
for 1 105 44
“prudence” 1 105 44
is 1 105 44
long 1 105 44
past. 1 105 44

Prudence 0 105 45
now 0 105 45
gives 0 105 45
way 0 105 45
to 0 105 45
mere 0 105 45
pusillanimity. 0 105 45

The 0 105 46
time 0 105 46
for 0 105 46
hierarchical 0 105 46
action 0 105 46
is 0 105 46
now, 0 105 46
before 0 105 46
the 0 105 46
damage 0 105 46
to 0 105 46
the 0 105 46
Church 0 105 46
becomes 0 105 46
irreparable. 0 105 46

The 0 105 47
members 0 105 47
of 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
hierarchy 0 105 47
seemingly 0 105 47
cowed 0 105 47
by 0 105 47
a 1 105 47
papal 1 105 47
tyranny 1 105 47
the 1 105 47
Church 1 105 47
has 1 105 47
never 1 105 47
before 1 105 47
seen 1 105 47
must 0 105 47
rise 0 105 47
immediately 0 105 47
and 0 105 47
give 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
courageous 0 105 47
answer 0 105 47
to 0 105 47
the 0 105 47
challenge 0 105 47
posed 0 105 47
long 0 105 47
ago 0 105 47
by 0 105 47
Monsignor 0 105 47
Klaus 0 105 47
Gamber, 0 105 47
when 0 105 47
an 0 105 47
already 0 105 47
monumental 0 105 47
ecclesial 0 105 47
crisis 0 105 47
was 0 105 47
still 0 105 47
in 0 105 47
what 0 105 47
can 0 105 47
now 0 105 47
can 0 105 47
be 0 105 47
seen 0 105 47
as 0 105 47
merely 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
preliminary 0 105 47
stage: 0 105 47

Where 0 105 48
in 0 105 48
our 0 105 48
Church 0 105 48
are 0 105 48
the 0 105 48
leaders 0 105 48
who 0 105 48
can 0 105 48
show 0 105 48
us 0 105 48
the 0 105 48
right 0 105 48
path? 0 105 48

Where 0 105 49
are 0 105 49
the 0 105 49
bishops 0 105 49
courageous 0 105 49
enough 0 105 49
to 1 105 49
cut 1 105 49
out 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
cancerous 1 105 49
growth 1 105 49
of 1 105 49
modernist 1 105 49
theology 1 105 49
that 1 105 49
has 1 105 49
implanted 1 105 49
itself 1 105 49
and 1 105 49
is 1 105 49
festering 1 105 49
within 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
celebration 1 105 49
of 1 105 49
even 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
most 1 105 49
sacred 1 105 49
mysteries, 1 105 49
before 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
cancer 1 105 49
spreads 1 105 49
and 1 105 49
causes 1 105 49
even 1 105 49
greater 1 105 49
damage? 1 105 49

What 0 105 50
we 0 105 50
need 0 105 50
today 0 105 50
is 0 105 50
a 0 105 50
new 0 105 50
Athanasius, 0 105 50
a 0 105 50
new 0 105 50
Basil, 0 105 50
bishops 0 105 50
like 0 105 50
those 0 105 50
who 0 105 50
in 0 105 50
the 0 105 50
fourth 0 105 50
century 0 105 50
fought 0 105 50
courageously 0 105 50
against 0 105 50
Arianism 0 105 50
when 0 105 50
almost 0 105 50
the 0 105 50
whole 0 105 50
of 0 105 50
Christendom 0 105 50
had 0 105 50
succumbed 0 105 50
to 0 105 50
heresy. 0 105 50

Will 0 105 51
none 0 105 51
of 0 105 51
the 0 105 51
hierarchs 0 105 51
rise 0 105 51
to 0 105 51
defend 0 105 51
the 0 105 51
Church 0 105 51
as 0 105 51
“a 0 105 51
new 0 105 51
Athanasius, 0 105 51
a 0 105 51
new 0 105 51

In 0 110 7
this 0 110 7
case 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
marriage 0 110 7
valid 0 110 7
before 0 110 7
God 0 110 7
would 0 110 7
be 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
second 0 110 7
one 0 110 7
and 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
pastor 0 110 7
could 0 110 7
grant 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
sacrament, 0 110 7
certainly 0 110 7
with 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
appropriate 0 110 7
precautions 0 110 7
as 0 110 7
not 0 110 7
to 0 110 7
scandalize 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
community 0 110 7
of 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
faithful 0 110 7

not 0 110 7
to 0 110 7
weaken 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
conviction 0 110 7
of 0 110 7
marriage 0 110 7
indissolubility. 0 110 7

The 0 110 8
Cardinal 0 110 8
knows 0 110 8
this 0 110 8
is 0 110 8
moral 1 110 8
and 1 110 8
canonical 1 110 8
nonsense. 1 110 8

No 1 110 9
Catholic, 1 110 9
whether 1 110 9
or 1 110 9
not 1 110 9
he 1 110 9
consults 1 110 9
a 1 110 9
priest, 1 110 9
can 1 110 9
declare 1 110 9
for 1 110 9
himself 1 110 9
that 1 110 9
his 1 110 9
marriage 1 110 9
in 1 110 9
the 1 110 9
Church 1 110 9
was 1 110 9
invalid, 1 110 9
especially 1 110 9
when—indeed 1 110 9
because—he 1 110 9
lacks 1 110 9
canonical 1 110 9
proof 1 110 9
of 1 110 9
invalidity. 1 110 9

Moreover, 0 110 10
absent 0 110 10
an 0 110 10

a 0 110 10

thus 0 110 10
a 0 110 10

in 0 110 16
which 0 110 16
a 0 110 16

“as 0 110 16

that 0 110 16

Even 0 110 17
then, 0 110 17
the 0 110 17

lest 0 110 17
other 0 110 17

Does 0 110 18
Cardinal 0 110 18
Müller 0 110 18
think 0 110 18
we 0 110 18
are 0 110 18
fools? 0 110 18

Some 0 110 19
of 0 110 19
us 0 110 19
apparently 0 110 19
are, 0 110 19
or 0 110 19
at 0 110 19
least 0 110 19
are 0 110 19
willing 0 110 19
to 0 110 19
serve 0 110 19
as 0 110 19
knowing 0 110 19
dupes 0 110 19

defending 0 110 19
neo-Pharisaical 0 110 19
sophistry 0 110 19
that 0 110 19
would 0 110 19
produce 0 110 19
“a 0 110 19

they 0 110 20

they 0 110 20
can 0 110 20
fool 1 110 20

an 0 110 20

both 0 112 3
of 0 112 3
these 0 112 3
are 0 112 3
true. 0 112 3

There 0 112 4

plenty 0 112 4
of 0 112 4
these 0 112 4
people 0 112 4

are 0 112 4

why 0 112 7

Orban 0 112 7

“We 0 112 7

Instead, 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
tough-talking 0 112 7
politician 0 112 7
said 0 112 7
they 0 112 7
were 0 112 7
regarded 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
“Muslim 1 112 7

Syria, 0 112 7
all 0 112 7
of 0 112 7
which 0 112 7
are 0 112 7
not 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
rich 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
Germany 0 112 7
but 0 112 7
are 0 112 7
economically 0 112 7
stable, 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
PM 0 112 7
said. 0 112 7

He 0 112 8
was 0 112 8
apparently 0 112 8
referring 0 112 8
to 0 112 8
Turkey, 0 112 8
Greece, 0 112 8
Macedonia 0 112 8
and 0 112 8
Serbia 0 112 8
– 0 112 8
a 0 112 8
common 0 112 8
route 0 112 8
for 0 112 8
migrants 0 112 8
heading 0 112 8
for 0 112 8
‘wealthy’ 0 112 8
Europe. 0 112 8

“So, 0 112 9
they 0 112 9
are 0 112 9
not 0 112 9
running 0 112 9

their 0 112 9
lives 0 112 9
[in 0 112 9
these 0 112 9
countries]. 0 112 9

They 0 112 10
are 0 112 10
merely 0 112 10
economic 0 112 10
migrants 0 112 10
seeking 0 112 10
a 0 112 10
better 0 112 10
life,” 0 112 10
Orban 0 112 10
concluded. 0 112 10

He 0 112 11
stressed 0 112 11
though, 0 112 11
that 0 112 11
he 0 112 11
can 0 112 11
only 0 112 11
speak 0 112 11
for 0 112 11
the 0 112 11
Hungarians 0 112 11
and 0 112 11
they 1 112 11
“don’t 1 112 11
want” 1 112 11
immigration. 1 112 11

In 0 112 12
his 0 112 12
view, 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
government 0 112 12
simply 0 112 12
can’t 0 112 12
go 0 112 12
against 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
will 0 112 12
of 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
people. 0 112 12

And 0 112 13
Orban 0 112 13
has 0 112 13
stayed 0 112 13
the 0 112 13
course, 0 112 13
too 0 112 13
while 0 112 13
governments 0 112 13
like 0 112 13
that 0 112 13
of 0 112 13
Germany 0 112 13
have 0 112 13
ignored 0 112 13
their 0 112 13

to 0 112 13
allow 0 112 13
for 0 112 13
a 0 112 13
clear 0 112 13
invasion 0 112 13
of 0 112 13
Germany 0 112 13
that 0 112 13
has 0 112 13
led 0 112 13
to 0 112 13
untold 1 112 13
numbers 1 112 13
of 0 112 13
sexual 1 112 13

Muslim 1 112 13
migrants, 1 112 13
attacks 1 112 13
on 1 112 13
Christians 1 112 13
and 1 112 13
there's 1 112 13
no 1 112 13
telling 1 112 13
the 1 112 13
amount 1 112 13
of 1 112 13
damage 1 112 13
to 1 112 13
the 1 112 13

Going 0 112 15
further, 0 112 15
the 0 112 15
prime 0 112 15
minister 0 112 15
noted 0 112 15
that 0 112 15
no 0 112 15
refugee 0 112 15
wants 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
go 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
Portugal, 0 112 15
for 0 112 15
example, 0 112 15
adding 0 112 15
that 0 112 15
the 0 112 15
majority 0 112 15
of 0 112 15
asylum 0 112 15
seekers 0 112 15
simply 0 112 15
wanted 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
live 0 112 15
in 0 112 15
prosperous 0 112 15
Germany. 0 112 15

“The 1 112 16
reason 1 112 16
why 1 112 16
people 1 112 16
are 1 112 16
in 1 112 16
your 1 112 16
country 1 112 16
is 1 112 16
not 1 112 16
because 1 112 16
they 1 112 16
are 1 112 16
refugees, 1 112 16
but 1 112 16
because 1 112 16
they 1 112 16
want 1 112 16
a 1 112 16
German 1 112 16
life,” 1 112 16
he 0 112 16
said, 0 112 16
describing 0 112 16
the 0 112 16
issue 0 112 16
“politically” 0 112 16
as 0 112 16
a 0 112 16
European 0 112 16
problem 0 112 16
but, 0 112 16
“sociologically,” 0 112 16
as 0 112 16
a 0 112 16
German 0 112 16
problem. 0 112 16

Orban 0 112 17
specifically 0 112 17
targeted 0 112 17
Germany 0 112 17
and 0 112 17
Chancellor 0 112 17
Angela 0 112 17
Merkel’s 0 112 17
‘open-door’ 0 112 17
policy 0 112 17
towards 0 112 17
asylum 0 112 17
seekers. 0 112 17

“I’ve 0 112 18
never 0 112 18
understood 0 112 18
how 0 112 18
chaos, 1 112 18
anarchy 1 112 18
and 1 112 18
illegal 1 112 18
border 1 112 18
crossings 1 112 18
are 0 112 18
viewed 0 112 18
as 0 112 18
something 0 112 18
good 0 112 18
in 0 112 18
a 0 112 18
country 0 112 18
like 0 112 18
Germany, 0 112 18
which 0 112 18
we 0 112 18
view 0 112 18
as 0 112 18
the 1 112 18
best 1 112 18
example 1 112 18
of 1 112 18
discipline 1 112 18
and 1 112 18
the 1 112 18
rule 1 112 18
of 1 112 18
law,” 1 112 18
he 0 112 18
said. 0 112 18

The 0 112 19
recent 0 112 19
wave 0 112 19
of 0 112 19
refugees 0 112 19
reaching 0 112 19
Europe 0 112 19
is 0 112 19
merely 0 112 19
an 0 112 19
invasion, 1 112 19
according 0 112 19
to 0 112 19
Orban. 0 112 19

“If 0 112 20
someone 0 112 20
wants 0 112 20
to 0 112 20
come 0 112 20
to 0 112 20
your 0 112 20
house, 0 112 20
he 0 112 20
knocks 0 112 20
on 0 112 20
your 0 112 20
door 0 112 20
and 0 112 20
asks: 0 112 20
‘Can 0 112 20

come 0 112 20
in, 0 112 20
can 0 112 20

stay?’ 0 112 20
They 0 112 20
[asylum 0 112 20

didn’t 0 112 20
do 0 112 20
that, 0 112 20
they 0 112 20
crossed 0 112 20
the 0 112 20
border 0 112 20
illegally,” 0 112 20
he 0 112 20
stated. 0 112 20

Orban 0 112 21
then 0 112 21
did 0 112 21
what 0 112 21
most 0 112 21
political 0 112 21
representatives 0 112 21
will 0 112 21
simply 0 112 21
not 0 112 21
do, 0 112 21
he 0 112 21
told 0 112 21
the 0 112 21
truth 0 112 21
about 0 112 21
multiculturalism. 0 112 21

He 0 112 22
called 0 112 22
it 0 112 22
an 0 112 22
"illusion" 0 112 22
and 0 112 22
said 0 112 22
that 0 112 22
Christian 1 112 22

Muslim 1 112 22
societies 1 112 22
“will 1 112 22
never 1 112 22

Of 0 112 23
course, 0 112 23
they 0 112 23
won't. 0 112 23

They 1 112 24
have 1 112 24
absolutely 1 112 24
nothing 1 112 24
in 1 112 24
common. 1 112 24

They 1 112 25
cannot 1 112 25
agree 1 112 25
on 1 112 25
God's 1 112 25
law, 1 112 25
which 1 112 25
most 1 112 25
Western 1 112 25

were 1 112 25

on, 1 112 25

the 1 112 25

They 1 112 26

He 0 112 31
has 0 112 31
rebuffed 0 112 31

which 0 112 31
is 0 112 31
largely 0 112 31

as 1 112 33
emulated 1 112 33
by 1 112 33
the 1 112 33
Protestant 1 112 33

saying, 1 112 33
"That 1 112 33

Pamela 0 70 2

and 0 70 2
I 0 70 2
are 0 70 2
banned 0 70 2
from 0 70 2
entering 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
country 0 70 2
for 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
crime 0 70 2
of 0 70 2
telling 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
truth 0 70 2
about 0 70 2
Islam 0 70 2
and 0 70 2
jihad. 0 70 2

According 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
Breitbart, 0 70 3
“Sellner, 0 70 3
who 0 70 3
described 0 70 3
the 0 70 3
detention 0 70 3
centre 0 70 3
as 0 70 3
looking 0 70 3
akin 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
a 0 70 3
typical 0 70 3
American 0 70 3
prison, 0 70 3
said 0 70 3
he 1 70 3
was 1 70 3
told 1 70 3
by 1 70 3
authorities 1 70 3
that 1 70 3
his 1 70 3
speaking 1 70 3
at 1 70 3
Hyde 1 70 3
Park 1 70 3
could 1 70 3
cause 1 70 3
violence 1 70 3
and 1 70 3
disrupt 1 70 3
community 1 70 3
cohesion.” 1 70 3

That’s 1 70 4
just 1 70 4
what 1 70 4
they 1 70 4
claimed 1 70 4
about 1 70 4
Pamela 1 70 4
Geller 1 70 4
and 1 70 4
me: 1 70 4
that 1 70 4
our 1 70 4
visit 1 70 4
could 1 70 4
cause 1 70 4
violence 1 70 4
and 1 70 4
disrupt 1 70 4
community 1 70 4
cohesion. 1 70 4

But 0 70 5
we, 0 70 5
of 0 70 5
course, 0 70 5
have 0 70 5
never 0 70 5
advocated 0 70 5
or 0 70 5
approved 0 70 5
of 0 70 5
any 0 70 5
violence. 0 70 5

The 0 70 6
UK 0 70 6
Home 0 70 6
Office 0 70 6
meant 0 70 6
that 0 70 6
our 0 70 6
visit 0 70 6
could 0 70 6
cause 0 70 6
violence 0 70 6
from 0 70 6
Muslims. 0 70 6

They 1 70 7
were 1 70 7
bowing 1 70 7
to 1 70 7
jihadist 1 70 7
intimidation. 1 70 7

Meanwhile, 1 70 8
Britain 1 70 8
has 1 70 8
a 1 70 8
steadily 1 70 8
lengthening 1 70 8
record 1 70 8
of 1 70 8
admitting 1 70 8
jihad 1 70 8
preachers 1 70 8
without 1 70 8
a 1 70 8
moment 1 70 8
of 1 70 8
hesitation. 1 70 8

Syed 0 70 9
Muzaffar 0 70 9
Shah 0 70 9
Qadri’s 0 70 9
preaching 1 70 9
of 1 70 9
hatred 1 70 9
and 1 70 9
jihad 1 70 9
violence 1 70 9
was 0 70 9
so 0 70 9
hardline 0 70 9
that 0 70 9
he 0 70 9
was 0 70 9
banned 0 70 9
from 0 70 9
preaching 0 70 9
in 0 70 9
Pakistan, 0 70 9
but 0 70 9
the 0 70 9
UK 0 70 9
Home 0 70 9
Office 0 70 9
welcomed 0 70 9
him 0 70 9
into 0 70 9
Britain. 0 70 9

The 0 70 10
UK 0 70 10
Home 0 70 10
Office 0 70 10
also 0 70 10
admitted 0 70 10
Shaykh 0 70 10
Hamza 0 70 10
Sodagar 0 70 10
into 0 70 10
the 0 70 10
country, 0 70 10
despite 0 70 10
the 0 70 10
fact 0 70 10
that 0 70 10
he 0 70 10
has 0 70 10
said: 0 70 10
“If 1 70 10
there’s 1 70 10
homosexual 1 70 10
men, 1 70 10
the 1 70 10
punishment 1 70 10
is 1 70 10
one 1 70 10
of 1 70 10
five 1 70 10
things. 1 70 10

One 1 70 11
– 1 70 11
the 1 70 11
easiest 1 70 11
one 1 70 11
maybe 1 70 11
– 1 70 11
chop 1 70 11
their 1 70 11
head 1 70 11
off, 1 70 11
that’s 1 70 11
the 1 70 11
easiest. 1 70 11

Second 1 70 12
– 1 70 12
burn 1 70 12
them 1 70 12
to 1 70 12
death. 1 70 12

Third 1 70 13
– 1 70 13
throw 1 70 13
’em 1 70 13
off 1 70 13
a 1 70 13
cliff. 1 70 13

Fourth 1 70 14
– 1 70 14
tear 1 70 14
down 1 70 14
a 1 70 14
wall 1 70 14
on 1 70 14
them 1 70 14
so 1 70 14
they 1 70 14
die 1 70 14
under 1 70 14
that. 1 70 14

Fifth 1 70 15
– 1 70 15
a 1 70 15
combination 1 70 15
of 1 70 15
the 1 70 15
above.” 1 70 15

Theresa 0 70 16
May’s 0 70 16
relentlessly 1 70 16
appeasement-minded 1 70 16
government 1 70 16
also 0 70 16
admitted 0 70 16
two 0 70 16
jihad 0 70 16
preachers 0 70 16
who 0 70 16
had 0 70 16
praised 0 70 16
the 0 70 16
murderer 0 70 16
of 0 70 16
a 0 70 16
foe 0 70 16
of 0 70 16
Pakistan’s 0 70 16
blasphemy 0 70 16
laws. 0 70 16

One 0 70 17
of 0 70 17
them 0 70 17
was 0 70 17
welcomed 0 70 17
by 0 70 17
the 0 70 17
Archbishop 0 70 17
of 0 70 17
Canterbury. 0 70 17

Nor 0 70 18
does 0 70 18
the 0 70 18
UK 0 70 18
admit 0 70 18
only 0 70 18
preachers 0 70 18
of 0 70 18
jihad 0 70 18
terror. 0 70 18

It 0 70 19
admits 0 70 19
jihad 0 70 19
terrorists 0 70 19
as 0 70 19
well, 0 70 19
even 0 70 19
when 0 70 19
it 0 70 19
knows 0 70 19
they 0 70 19
are 0 70 19
jihad 0 70 19
terrorists. 0 70 19

The 0 70 20
Muslim 0 70 20
migrant 0 70 20
teen 0 70 20
who 0 70 20
bombed 0 70 20
the 0 70 20
London 0 70 20
Tube 0 70 20
told 0 70 20
border 0 70 20
officials 0 70 20
that 0 70 20
he 0 70 20
was 0 70 20
trained 0 70 20
by 0 70 20
ISIS, 0 70 20
but 0 70 20
was 0 70 20
admitted 0 70 20
anyway. 0 70 20

Meanwhile, 1 70 21
the 1 70 21
UK 1 70 21
banned 1 70 21
three 1 70 21

(Some 0 191 1
Final 0 191 1
Thoughts 0 191 1
on 0 191 1
Joseph 0 191 1
Ratzinger) 0 191 1

Recently 0 191 2
an 0 191 2
editor 0 191 2
of 0 191 2
a 0 191 2
“conservative” 0 191 2
Catholic 0 191 2
magazine 0 191 2
asked 0 191 2
me 0 191 2
if 0 191 2
I 0 191 2
would 0 191 2
be 0 191 2
interested 0 191 2
in 0 191 2
contributing 0 191 2
a 0 191 2
piece 0 191 2
about 0 191 2
the 0 191 2
resignation 0 191 2
of 0 191 2
Pope 0 191 2
Benedict 0 191 2
XVI, 0 191 2
five 0 191 2
years 0 191 2
on. 0 191 2

I 0 191 3
declined, 0 191 3
telling 0 191 3
him 0 191 3
that 0 191 3
I 0 191 3
was 0 191 3
morally 0 191 3
certain 0 191 3
that 0 191 3
anything 0 191 3
I 0 191 3
had 0 191 3
to 0 191 3
say 0 191 3
about 0 191 3
it 0 191 3
would 0 191 3
not 0 191 3
be 0 191 3
in 0 191 3
keeping 0 191 3
with 0 191 3
his 0 191 3
editorial 0 191 3
policies. 0 191 3

It’s 0 191 4
been 0 191 4
five 0 191 4
years, 0 191 4
and 0 191 4
I’ve 0 191 4
noticed 0 191 4
that 0 191 4
there 0 191 4
are 0 191 4
a 0 191 4
lot 0 191 4
fewer 0 191 4
people 0 191 4
talking 0 191 4
about 0 191 4
what 0 191 4
a 0 191 4
“courageous” 0 191 4
act 0 191 4
it 0 191 4
was 0 191 4
to 0 191 4
give 0 191 4
up 0 191 4
the 0 191 4
pontificate. 0 191 4

The 0 191 5
consequences 0 191 5
of 0 191 5
that 0 191 5
act 0 191 5
have 0 191 5
been 0 191 5
so 1 191 5
outlandish 1 191 5
– 0 191 5
even 0 191 5
for 0 191 5
people 0 191 5
who 0 191 5
are 0 191 5
mostly 0 191 5
OK 0 191 5
with 0 191 5
Francis 0 191 5
– 0 191 5
that 0 191 5
very 0 191 5
few 0 191 5
people 0 191 5
are 0 191 5
still 0 191 5
willing 0 191 5
to 0 191 5
make 0 191 5
polite 0 191 5
noises 0 191 5
about 0 191 5
it. 0 191 5

Note: 0 191 6
In 0 191 6
a 0 191 6
March 0 191 6
11th 0 191 6
letter 0 191 6
signed 0 191 6
by 0 191 6
Pope 0 191 6
Emeritus 0 191 6
Benedict 0 191 6

Dario 0 191 7
Vigano, 0 191 7
prefect 0 191 7
of 0 191 7
the 0 191 7
Secretariat 0 191 7
for 0 191 7
Communications, 0 191 7
the 0 191 7
former 0 191 7
pope 0 191 7
reportedly 0 191 7
offers 0 191 7
an 0 191 7
impassioned 1 191 7
defense 1 191 7
of 0 191 7
Pope 0 191 7
Francis 0 191 7
against 0 191 7
the 0 191 7
claim 0 191 7
that 0 191 7
he 0 191 7
lacks 0 191 7
theological 0 191 7
and 0 191 7
philosophical 0 191 7
formation. 0 191 7

In 0 191 8
no 0 191 8
uncertain 0 191 8
terms, 0 191 8
this 0 191 8
letter, 0 191 8
bearing 0 191 8
Benedict's 0 191 8
signature, 0 191 8
affirms 0 191 8
that 0 191 8
“there 0 191 8
is 0 191 8
an 0 191 8
internal 0 191 8
continuity 0 191 8
between 0 191 8
the 0 191 8
two 0 191 8
pontificates.” 0 191 8
Whether 0 191 8
Benedict 0 191 8
actually 0 191 8
wrote 0 191 8
this 0 191 8
letter 0 191 8
or 0 191 8
not, 0 191 8
it 0 191 8
gives 0 191 8

to 0 191 8
a 0 191 8
number 0 191 8
of 0 191 8
grave 1 191 8
questions 1 191 8
that 0 191 8
need 0 191 8
to 0 191 8
be 0 191 8
answered 0 191 8
rather 0 191 8

of 0 191 9
these 0 191 9

MJM 0 191 10

In 0 191 11
fact, 0 191 11
five 0 191 11
years 0 191 11
after 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
resignation 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
Pope 0 191 11
Benedict 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
Catholic 0 191 11
faithful 0 191 11
mostly 0 191 11
want 0 191 11
to 0 191 11
know 0 191 11
why; 0 191 11
why 0 191 11
would 0 191 11
a 0 191 11
pope 0 191 11
– 0 191 11
a 0 191 11
man 0 191 11
with 0 191 11
decades 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
up-close-and-personal 0 191 11
experience 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
“filth” 1 191 11
in 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
Curia 0 191 11
and 0 191 11
throughout 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
church 0 191 11
– 0 191 11
suddenly 0 191 11
just 0 191 11
decide 0 191 11
to 0 191 11
quit? 0 191 11

Why 0 191 12
would 0 191 12
he 0 191 12
choose 0 191 12
to 0 191 12
walk 0 191 12
away 0 191 12
knowing 0 191 12
that 0 191 12
his 0 191 12
task 0 191 12
was 0 191 12
not 0 191 12
completed? 0 191 12

At 0 191 13
the 0 191 13
time 0 191 13
and 0 191 13
since 0 191 13
then, 0 191 13
particularly 0 191 13
in 0 191 13
light 0 191 13
of 0 191 13
what 0 191 13
has 0 191 13
been 0 191 13
happening, 0 191 13
it 0 191 13
seems 0 191 13
one 1 191 13
of 1 191 13
the 1 191 13
most 1 191 13
bizarre 1 191 13
aspects 1 191 13
of 1 191 13
this 1 191 13
whole 1 191 13
bizarre 1 191 13
situation 1 191 13
that 0 191 13
the 0 191 13
reasons 0 191 13
offered 0 191 13
have 0 191 13
been 0 191 13
so 1 191 13
trivial, 1 191 13
so 1 191 13
inappropriately, 1 191 13
so 1 191 13
disproportionately 1 191 13
petty. 1 191 13

These 0 191 14
absurd 1 191 14
responses 1 191 14
to 1 191 14
serious 1 191 14
questions 1 191 14
of 1 191 14
grave 1 191 14
import 1 191 14
have 0 191 14
raised 0 191 14
the 0 191 14
inescapable 0 191 14
suspicion 0 191 14
that 0 191 14
Benedict 0 191 14
simply 0 191 14
did 0 191 14
not 0 191 14
take 0 191 14
the 0 191 14
papacy 0 191 14
as 0 191 14
seriously 0 191 14
as 0 191 14
the 0 191 14
rest 0 191 14
of 0 191 14
us 0 191 14
did. 0 191 14

We 0 191 15
cannot 0 191 15
help 0 191 15
but 0 191 15
wonder 0 191 15
if 0 191 15
these 0 191 15
trivialised 0 191 15
responses 0 191 15
reveal 0 191 15
some 0 191 15
deep 0 191 15
flaw 0 191 15
that 0 191 15
we 0 191 15
had 0 191 15
never 0 191 15
suspected 0 191 15
before. 0 191 15

Could 1 191 16
we 1 191 16
have 1 191 16
been 1 191 16
wrong 1 191 16
about 1 191 16
him? 1 191 16

And 1 191 17
if 1 191 17
so, 1 191 17
could 1 191 17
we 1 191 17
have 1 191 17
been 1 191 17
this 1 191 17
wrong? 1 191 17

For 0 191 18
reasons, 0 191 18
all 0 191 18
we 0 191 18
heard 0 191 18
at 0 191 18
the 0 191 18
time 0 191 18
was, 0 191 18
essentially, 0 191 18
“I’m 1 191 18
tired.” 1 191 18
There 0 191 18
was 0 191 18
some 0 191 18
implication 0 191 18
that 0 191 18
he 0 191 18
didn’t 0 191 18
feel 0 191 18
up 0 191 18
to 0 191 18
international 0 191 18
travel 0 191 18
anymore, 0 191 18
so 0 191 18
couldn’t 0 191 18
make 0 191 18
it 0 191 18
to 0 191 18
World 0 191 18
Youth 0 191 18
Day 0 191 18
and 0 191 18
similar 0 191 18
events. 0 191 18

The 0 191 19
trivialising 0 191 19
of 0 191 19
the 0 191 19
resignation 0 191 19
seemed 0 191 19
to 0 191 19
go 0 191 19
hand 0 191 19
in 0 191 19
hand 0 191 19
with 0 191 19
the 0 191 19
modern 0 191 19
concept 0 191 19
of 0 191 19
the 0 191 19
pope-as-pop-star, 1 191 19
something 0 191 19
we 0 191 19
had 0 191 19
thought 0 191 19
Benedict 0 191 19
was 0 191 19
too 0 191 19
serious 0 191 19
a 0 191 19
man, 0 191 19
too 0 191 19
serious 0 191 19
a 0 191 19
Catholic, 0 191 19
to 0 191 19
believe 0 191 19
himself. 0 191 19

Of 0 191 20
all 0 191 20
people, 0 191 20
we 0 191 20
had 0 191 20
assumed 0 191 20
that 0 191 20
Benedict 0 191 20
XVI 0 191 20
took 0 191 20
the 0 191 20
papacy 0 191 20
seriously. 0 191 20

And 0 191 21
since 0 191 21
then, 0 191 21
as 0 191 21
all 0 191 21
the 0 191 21
poisons 0 191 21
that 0 191 21
had 0 191 21
been 0 191 21
lurking 0 191 21
for 0 191 21
fifty 0 191 21
years 0 191 21
in 0 191 21
the 0 191 21
NewChurch 1 191 21
mud 1 191 21
are 0 191 21
busily 0 191 21
hatching 0 191 21
out, 0 191 21
many 0 191 21
Catholics 0 191 21
want 0 191 21
to 0 191 21
know 0 191 21
why 0 191 21
we 0 191 21
hear 0 191 21
nothing 0 191 21
from 0 191 21
him? 0 191 21

This 0 191 22
man 0 191 22
whom 0 191 22
we 0 191 22
had 0 191 22
believed 0 191 22
a 0 191 22
“champion 1 191 22
of 1 191 22
orthodoxy,” 1 191 22
whom 0 191 22
we 0 191 22
thought 0 191 22
we 0 191 22
knew. 0 191 22

Error, 0 191 23
even 0 191 23
heresy 1 191 23
and 1 191 23
blasphemy 1 191 23
are 0 191 23
pouring 0 191 23
daily 0 191 23
out 0 191 23
of 0 191 23
the 0 191 23
mouth 0 191 23
of 0 191 23
his 0 191 23
successor, 0 191 23
who 0 191 23
has, 0 191 23
literally, 0 191 23
turned 1 191 23
the 1 191 23
Vatican 1 191 23
into 1 191 23
a 1 191 23
den 1 191 23
of 1 191 23
thieves, 1 191 23
and 0 191 23
we 0 191 23
hear 0 191 23
nothing 0 191 23
but 0 191 23
the 0 191 23
occasional, 0 191 23
carefully 0 191 23
worded 0 191 23
statement 0 191 23
on 0 191 23
how 0 191 23
fine 0 191 23
everything 0 191 23
is. 0 191 23

How 0 191 24
content 0 191 24
he 0 191 24
is 0 191 24
with 0 191 24
his 0 191 24
decision 0 191 24
and 0 191 24
how 0 191 24
happy 0 191 24
with 0 191 24
his 0 191 24
current 0 191 24
life. 0 191 24

After 0 191 25
three 0 191 25
years 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
systematic 0 191 25
dismantling 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
everything 0 191 25
he 0 191 25
had 0 191 25
attempted 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
do 0 191 25
in 0 191 25
his 0 191 25
pontificate, 0 191 25
we 0 191 25
got 0 191 25
this 0 191 25
from 0 191 25
an 0 191 25
apparently 0 191 25
utterly 1 191 25
insouciant 1 191 25
Ratzinger, 0 191 25
addressed 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
Francis: 0 191 25
“Your 0 191 25
goodness 0 191 25
is 0 191 25
my 0 191 25
home 0 191 25
and 0 191 25
the 0 191 25
place 0 191 25
where 0 191 25
I 0 191 25
feel 0 191 25
safe.” 0 191 25
Everyone 0 191 25
who 0 191 25
had 0 191 25
ever 0 191 25
read 0 191 25
anything 0 191 25
he 0 191 25
had 0 191 25
written 0 191 25
were 0 191 25
amazed 0 191 25
he 0 191 25
was 0 191 25
capable 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
producing 0 191 25
such 0 191 25
maudlin 0 191 25
drivel, 0 191 25
but 0 191 25
the 0 191 25
video 0 191 25
doesn’t 0 191 25
lie: 0 191 25

So 0 191 26
strange 0 191 26
was 0 191 26
this 0 191 26
new 0 191 26
tone 0 191 26
that 0 191 26
speculation 0 191 26
started 0 191 26
circulating 0 191 26
that 0 191 26
he 0 191 26
was 0 191 26
under 0 191 26
some 0 191 26
kind 0 191 26
of 0 191 26
external 0 191 26
compulsion, 0 191 26
not 0 191 26
free 0 191 26
to 0 191 26
speak 0 191 26
his 0 191 26
mind. 0 191 26

But 0 191 27
this 0 191 27
is 0 191 27
not 0 191 27
what 0 191 27
we 0 191 27
see. 0 191 27

There 0 191 28
he 0 191 28
is, 0 191 28
manifestly 0 191 28
happy 0 191 28
and 0 191 28
reading 0 191 28
it 0 191 28
out 0 191 28
loud. 0 191 28

“Perhaps 0 191 29
it 0 191 29
was 0 191 29
written 0 191 29
for 0 191 29
him.” 0 191 29
Well, 0 191 29
why 0 191 29
repeat 0 191 29
it 0 191 29
then? 0 191 29

Why, 0 191 30
if 0 191 30
he 0 191 30
has 0 191 30
any 0 191 30
qualms, 0 191 30
allow 0 191 30
himself 0 191 30
to 0 191 30
be 0 191 30
trotted 0 191 30
out 0 191 30
on 0 191 30
such 0 191 30
occasions, 0 191 30
to 0 191 30
read 0 191 30
this 0 191 30
blatant 0 191 30
propaganda? 0 191 30

If 0 191 31
it 0 191 31
is 0 191 31
a 0 191 31
deception, 0 191 31
why 0 191 31
participate 0 191 31
in 0 191 31
it? 0 191 31

In 0 191 32
fact, 0 191 32
all 0 191 32
the 0 191 32
hopeful 0 191 32
commenters 0 191 32
on 0 191 32
blogs 0 191 32
and 0 191 32
other 0 191 32
social 0 191 32
media 0 191 32
who 0 191 32
keep 0 191 32
telling 0 191 32
me 0 191 32
how 0 191 32
much 0 191 32
they 0 191 32
“miss” 0 191 32
him 0 191 32
have 0 191 32
failed 0 191 32
to 0 191 32
respect 0 191 32
him 0 191 32
in 0 191 32
one 0 191 32
way; 0 191 32
they 0 191 32
won’t 0 191 32
take 0 191 32
him 0 191 32
at 0 191 32
his 0 191 32
word. 0 191 32

Some 0 191 33
insist 0 191 33
that 0 191 33
his 0 191 33
resignation 0 191 33
was 0 191 33
under 0 191 33
some 0 191 33
sort 0 191 33
of 0 191 33
coercion 0 191 33
and 0 191 33
so 0 191 33
isn’t 0 191 33
valid. 0 191 33

But 0 191 34
we 0 191 34
have 0 191 34
repeatedly 0 191 34
heard 0 191 34
from 0 191 34
him 0 191 34
that 0 191 34
he 0 191 34
was 0 191 34
under 0 191 34
no 0 191 34
constraint, 0 191 34
that 0 191 34
he 0 191 34
had 0 191 34
resigned 0 191 34
freely. 0 191 34

And 0 191 35
indeed, 0 191 35
far 0 191 35
from 0 191 35
being 0 191 35
an 0 191 35
isolated 0 191 35
“prisoner 1 191 35
of 1 191 35
the 1 191 35
Vatican,” 1 191 35
Benedict 0 191 35
has 0 191 35
received 0 191 35
many 0 191 35
guests 0 191 35
all 0 191 35
of 0 191 35
whom 0 191 35
report 0 191 35
that, 0 191 35
though 0 191 35
frail, 0 191 35
he 0 191 35
appears 0 191 35
content 0 191 35
and 0 191 35
never 0 191 35
utters 0 191 35
a 0 191 35
word 0 191 35
of 0 191 35
criticism. 0 191 35

We 0 191 36
have 0 191 36
yet 0 191 36
to 0 191 36
hear 0 191 36
any 0 191 36
report 0 191 36
of 0 191 36
any 0 191 36
notes 0 191 36
begging 0 191 36
for 0 191 36
rescue 0 191 36
hidden 0 191 36
under 0 191 36
a 0 191 36
lunch 0 191 36
table 0 191 36
placemat. 0 191 36

There’s 0 191 37
no 0 191 37
doubt 0 191 37
that 0 191 37
this 0 191 37
is 0 191 37
an 0 191 37
extremely 0 191 37
strange 0 191 37
and 0 191 37
frankly 0 191 37
fishy 0 191 37
situation; 0 191 37
something 0 191 37
doesn’t 0 191 37
add 0 191 37
up, 0 191 37
it’s 0 191 37
true. 0 191 37

All 0 191 38
the 0 191 38
questions 0 191 38
have 0 191 38
gone 0 191 38
ignored, 0 191 38
or 0 191 38
have 0 191 38
received 0 191 38
frivolous, 1 191 38
jokey 1 191 38
responses: 1 191 38

Why 0 191 39
did 0 191 39
you 0 191 39
resign? 0 191 39

Ratzinger: 0 191 40
“I 0 191 40
was 0 191 40
a 0 191 40
bit 0 191 40
tired 0 191 40
and 0 191 40
didn’t 0 191 40
feel 0 191 40
up 0 191 40
to 0 191 40
partying 0 191 40
with 0 191 40
the 0 191 40
kids 0 191 40
at 0 191 40
World 0 191 40
Youth 0 191 40
Day.” 0 191 40

If 0 191 41
you’re 0 191 41
not 0 191 41
pope, 0 191 41
why 0 191 41
do 0 191 41
you 0 191 41
still 0 191 41
wear 0 191 41
the 0 191 41
white? 0 191 41

Ratzinger: 0 191 42
“Oh, 0 191 42
there 0 191 42
wasn’t 0 191 42
a 0 191 42
black 0 191 42
cassock 0 191 42
that 0 191 42
fit 0 191 42
me.” 0 191 42

Why 0 191 43
do 0 191 43
you 0 191 43
continue 0 191 43
to 0 191 43
call 0 191 43
yourself 0 191 43
Benedict 0 191 43
XVI 0 191 43
if 0 191 43
you 0 191 43
are 0 191 43
no 0 191 43
longer 0 191 43
pope? 0 191 43

Ratzinger: 0 191 44
“Well, 0 191 44
I’m 0 191 44
an 0 191 44
‘emeritus,’ 0 191 44
you 0 191 44
see…” 0 191 44

And 0 191 45
where 0 191 45
did 0 191 45
this 0 191 45
“emeritus” 0 191 45
business 0 191 45
come 0 191 45
from? 0 191 45

Does 0 191 46
it 0 191 46
have 0 191 46
any 0 191 46
precedent 0 191 46
in 0 191 46
Catholic 0 191 46
history? 0 191 46

What 0 191 47
does 0 191 47
it 0 191 47
mean 0 191 47
canonically 0 191 47
and 0 191 47
doctrinally? 0 191 47

Ratzinger: 0 191 48
“…” 0 191 48

What 0 191 49
was 0 191 49
all 1 191 49
that 1 191 49
rubbish 1 191 49
from 0 191 49
Ganswein 0 191 49
about 0 191 49
there 0 191 49
being 0 191 49
a 0 191 49
divided 0 191 49
“munus” 0 191 49
– 0 191 49
with 0 191 49
an 0 191 49
active 0 191 49
member 0 191 49
and 0 191 49
a 0 191 49
“contemplative 0 191 49
member”? 0 191 49

Doesn’t 0 191 50
that 0 191 50
just 0 191 50
mean 0 191 50
there 0 191 50
are 0 191 50
two 0 191 50
popes 0 191 50
now? 0 191 50

Ratzinger: 0 191 51
“…” 0 191 51

And 0 191 52
perhaps 0 191 52
most 0 191 52
agonising 0 191 52
of 0 191 52
all: 0 191 52
“How 1 191 52
can 1 191 52
you 1 191 52
just 1 191 52
sit 1 191 52
there 1 191 52
smiling, 1 191 52
issuing 1 191 52
bland 1 191 52
platitudinous 1 191 52
nonsense, 1 191 52
while 1 191 52
this 1 191 52
lunatic 1 191 52
drives 1 191 52
the 1 191 52
sheep 1 191 52
off 1 191 52
a 1 191 52
cliff?” 1 191 52

A 0 191 53
few 0 191 53
days 0 191 53
ago, 0 191 53
my 0 191 53
friend 0 191 53
Steve 0 191 53
Skojec, 0 191 53

in 0 191 54
this 0 191 54
brief 0 191 54
post 0 191 54
all 0 191 54
the 0 191 54
anger 0 191 54
and 0 191 54
all 0 191 54
the 0 191 54
crushing 1 191 54
disappointment 1 191 54
most 0 191 54
of 0 191 54
us 0 191 54
probably 0 191 54
still 0 191 54
feel 0 191 54
reluctant 0 191 54
to 0 191 54
express 0 191 54
out 0 191 54
loud: 0 191 54

Five 0 191 55
years 0 191 55
ago 0 191 55
today, 0 191 55
Pope 0 191 55
Benedict 0 191 55
XVI 0 191 55
abdicated 0 191 55
the 0 191 55
papacy. 0 191 55

And 0 191 56
through 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
abandonment 0 191 56
of 0 191 56
his 0 191 56
duty 0 191 56
to 0 191 56
shepherd 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
Church, 0 191 56
he 0 191 56
made 0 191 56
way 0 191 56
for 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
worst 0 191 56
papacy 0 191 56
of 0 191 56
all 0 191 56
time 0 191 56
– 0 191 56
one 0 191 56
he 0 191 56
steadfastly 0 191 56
refuses 0 191 56
to 0 191 56
oppose 0 191 56
in 0 191 56
word, 0 191 56
deed, 0 191 56
or 0 191 56
even 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
subtlest 0 191 56
gesture. 0 191 56

You 0 191 57
may 0 191 57
love 0 191 57
him 0 191 57
for 0 191 57
various 0 191 57
reasons, 0 191 57
you 0 191 57
may 0 191 57
miss 0 191 57
him 0 191 57
by 0 191 57
contrast, 0 191 57
but 0 191 57
you 0 191 57
may 0 191 57
not 0 191 57
excuse 0 191 57
the 0 191 57
responsibility 0 191 57
he 0 191 57
has. 0 191 57

He 0 191 58
walked 0 191 58
away 0 191 58
from 0 191 58
his 0 191 58
family, 0 191 58
leaving 0 191 58
the 0 191 58
door 0 191 58
open 0 191 58
to 0 191 58
an 0 191 58
abusive 1 191 58
stepfather, 1 191 58
and 0 191 58
he 0 191 58
watches 1 191 58
his 1 191 58
children 1 191 58
beaten 1 191 58
and 1 191 58
led 1 191 58
astray 1 191 58
not 0 191 58
just 0 191 58
in 0 191 58
silence, 0 191 58
but 0 191 58
in 0 191 58
apparent 0 191 58
contentment. 0 191 58

And 0 191 59
still, 0 191 59
he 0 191 59
was 0 191 59
the 0 191 59
best 0 191 59
of 0 191 59
the 0 191 59
post-conciliar 0 191 59
popes, 0 191 59
which 0 191 59
is 0 191 59
why 0 191 59
he’s 0 191 59
the 0 191 59
only 0 191 59
one 0 191 59
who 0 191 59
won’t 0 191 59
be 0 191 59
canonized. 0 191 59

Who 0 191 60
is 0 191 60
the 0 191 60
real 0 191 60
Joseph 0 191 60
Ratzinger? 0 191 60

I 0 191 61
have 0 191 61
had 0 191 61
long-time 0 191 61
Vatican 0 191 61
watchers 0 191 61
say 0 191 61
to 0 191 61
me, 0 191 61
more 0 191 61
than 0 191 61
once, 0 191 61
“Maybe 0 191 61
it’s 0 191 61
really 0 191 61
just 0 191 61
that 0 191 61
he 0 191 61
wasn’t 0 191 61
who 0 191 61
we 0 191 61
thought 0 191 61
he 0 191 61
was.” 0 191 61
I 0 191 61
suspect 0 191 61
there 0 191 61
is 0 191 61
a 0 191 61
lot 0 191 61
more 0 191 61
to 0 191 61
this 0 191 61
than 0 191 61
most 0 191 61
people 0 191 61
might 0 191 61
imagine. 0 191 61

I 0 191 62
think 0 191 62
we 0 191 62
made 0 191 62
the 0 191 62
mistake 0 191 62
of 0 191 62
believing 0 191 62
the 0 191 62
press. 0 191 62

We 0 191 63
were 0 191 63
delighted 0 191 63
that 0 191 63
the 0 191 63
bitterly 1 191 63
anti-Catholic 1 191 63
media 1 191 63
hated 0 191 63
and 0 191 63
feared 0 191 63
him. 0 191 63

We 0 191 64
failed 0 191 64
to 0 191 64
recall 0 191 64
that 0 191 64
they 0 191 64
know 0 191 64
nothing 0 191 64
at 0 191 64
all 0 191 64
about 0 191 64
Catholicism. 0 191 64

What 0 191 65
the 0 191 65
papers 0 191 65
never 0 191 65
told 0 191 65
us 0 191 65
was 0 191 65
that 0 191 65
as 0 191 65
a 0 191 65
young 0 191 65
priest 0 191 65
and 0 191 65
theologian 0 191 65
Joseph 0 191 65
Ratzinger 0 191 65
was 1 191 65
known 1 191 65
as 1 191 65
a 1 191 65
“progressive,” 1 191 65
as 0 191 65
the 0 191 65
term 0 191 65
was 0 191 65
understood 0 191 65
in 0 191 65
1962. 0 191 65

This 0 191 66
reputation 0 191 66
was 0 191 66
cemented 0 191 66
during 0 191 66
his 0 191 66
work 0 191 66
as 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
peritus, 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
theological 0 191 66
advisor, 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
one 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
Council’s 0 191 66
most 0 191 66
influential 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
bishops 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
progressive 0 191 66
camp, 0 191 66
Cardinal 0 191 66
Josef 0 191 66
Frings 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
Cologne. 0 191 66

Frings’ 0 191 67
claim 0 191 67
to 0 191 67
fame 0 191 67
in 0 191 67
that 0 191 67
great 0 191 67
drama 0 191 67
was 0 191 67
a 0 191 67
speech 0 191 67
criticising 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
CDF 0 191 67
– 0 191 67
and 0 191 67
its 0 191 67
prefect 0 191 67
Cardinal 0 191 67
Alfredo 0 191 67
Ottaviani 0 191 67
– 0 191 67
for 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
“conservatism” 0 191 67
in 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
“schema,” 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
documents 0 191 67
prepared 0 191 67
by 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
CDF 0 191 67
for 0 191 67
guiding 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
bishops’ 0 191 67
discussions. 0 191 67

After 0 191 68
this 0 191 68
speech, 0 191 68
there 0 191 68
was 0 191 68
an 0 191 68
uprising 0 191 68
among 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
bishops 0 191 68
of 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
preparatory 0 191 68
committee 0 191 68
who 0 191 68
demanded 0 191 68
that 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
schema 0 191 68
– 0 191 68
that 0 191 68
had 0 191 68
taken 0 191 68
years 0 191 68
to 0 191 68
develop 0 191 68
– 0 191 68
be 0 191 68
abandoned. 0 191 68

This 0 191 69
was 0 191 69
done, 0 191 69
over 0 191 69
Ottaviani’s 0 191 69
futile 1 191 69
objections, 1 191 69
and 0 191 69
new 0 191 69
documents 0 191 69
were 0 191 69
rapidly 0 191 69
cobbled 0 191 69
together 0 191 69
by 0 191 69
a 0 191 69
coalition 0 191 69
of 0 191 69
German 0 191 69
and 0 191 69
French 0 191 69
“progressives” 1 191 69
who 0 191 69
rejoiced 0 191 69
that 0 191 69
they 0 191 69
had, 0 191 69
in 0 191 69
effect, 0 191 69
seized 0 191 69
control 0 191 69
of 0 191 69
the 0 191 69
Council 0 191 69
from 0 191 69
that 0 191 69
moment, 0 191 69
before 0 191 69
it 0 191 69
had 0 191 69
even 0 191 69
started. 0 191 69

It 0 191 70
has 0 191 70
since 0 191 70
been 0 191 70
revealed 0 191 70
that 0 191 70
it 0 191 70
was 0 191 70
Joseph 0 191 70
Ratzinger 0 191 70
– 0 191 70

maverick 0 191 70
“progressive” 1 191 70

brought 0 191 70
to 0 191 70
Rome 0 191 70
as 0 191 70
his 0 191 70
secretary 0 191 70
– 0 191 70
who 0 191 70
wrote 0 191 70
that 0 191 70
speech. 0 191 70

Cardinal 0 191 71
Henri 0 191 71
de 0 191 71
Lubac, 0 191 71
writing 0 191 71
in 0 191 71
1985, 0 191 71
recalling 0 191 71
that 0 191 71
drama, 0 191 71
said: 0 191 71

“Joseph 0 191 72
Ratzinger, 0 191 72
an 0 191 72
expert 0 191 72
at 0 191 72
the 0 191 72
Council, 0 191 72
was 0 191 72
also 0 191 72
the 0 191 72
private 0 191 72
secretary 0 191 72
of 0 191 72

Blind, 0 191 74
the 0 191 74
old 0 191 74
Cardinal 0 191 74
largely 0 191 74
utilized 0 191 74
his 0 191 74
secretary 0 191 74
to 0 191 74
write 0 191 74
his 0 191 74
interventions. 0 191 74

Now 0 191 75
then, 0 191 75
one 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
these 0 191 75
interventions 0 191 75
became 0 191 75
memorable: 0 191 75
it 0 191 75
was 0 191 75
a 0 191 75
radical 0 191 75
criticism 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
the 0 191 75
methods 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
the 0 191 75
Holy 0 191 75
Office. 0 191 75

Despite 0 191 76
a 0 191 76
reply 0 191 76
by 0 191 76
Card. 0 191 76

Ottaviani, 0 191 77
Frings 0 191 77
sustained 0 191 77
his 0 191 77
critique. 0 191 77

“It 0 191 78

then, 0 191 78
was 0 191 78
destroyed 0 191 78
by 0 191 78

did 0 191 81
not 0 191 81
change, 0 191 81

it.” 0 191 81

Ratzinger’s 0 191 82
reputation 0 191 82
as 0 191 82
a 0 191 82
“progressive” 1 191 82
is 0 191 82
not 0 191 82
based 0 191 82
on 0 191 82
one 0 191 82

nor 0 191 82
was 0 191 82
it 0 191 82
restricted 0 191 82
to 0 191 82
his 0 191 82
early 0 191 82
work. 0 191 82

It 0 191 83
went 0 191 83
unnoticed 0 191 83
in 0 191 83
the 0 191 83
shouting 0 191 83
over 0 191 83
his 0 191 83
running 0 191 83
of 0 191 83
CDF, 0 191 83
that 0 191 83
he 0 191 83
had 0 191 83
written 0 191 83
in 0 191 83
1982, 0 191 83
a 0 191 83
call 0 191 83

the 0 191 83
Church 0 191 83
“never 0 191 83

to 0 191 83

of 0 191 83

his 0 191 84
book 0 191 84
Principles 0 191 84
of 0 191 84
Catholic 0 191 84
Theology, 0 191 84
Ratzinger 0 191 84
proposed 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
question, 0 191 84
“Should 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
Council 0 191 84
be 0 191 84
revoked?” 0 191 84
and 0 191 84
in 0 191 84
response 0 191 84
recommended 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
“razing 0 191 84
of 0 191 84

bastions” 0 191 84
of 0 191 84
the 0 191 84

in 0 191 84
relation 0 191 84
to 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
modern 0 191 84
world: 0 191 84

The 0 191 85
duty 0 191 85
is, 0 191 85
therefore, 0 191 85
not 0 191 85
to 0 191 85
suppress 0 191 85
the 0 191 85
Council, 0 191 85
but 0 191 85
to 0 191 85
discover 0 191 85
the 0 191 85
real 0 191 85
Council 0 191 85
and 0 191 85
delve 0 191 85
deep 0 191 85
into 0 191 85
what 0 191 85
it 0 191 85
truly 0 191 85
wants 0 191 85
with 0 191 85
regard 0 191 85
to 0 191 85
what 0 191 85
has 0 191 85
happened 0 191 85
since 0 191 85
then. 0 191 85

This 0 191 86
implies 0 191 86
that 0 191 86
there 0 191 86
is 0 191 86
no 0 191 86
possible 0 191 86
return 0 191 86
to 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
Syllabus, 0 191 86
which 0 191 86
could 0 191 86
well 0 191 86
have 0 191 86
been 0 191 86
a 0 191 86
first 0 191 86
step 0 191 86
in 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
combat 0 191 86
against 0 191 86
Liberalism 0 191 86
and 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
nascent 0 191 86
Marxism, 0 191 86
but 0 191 86
which 0 191 86
cannot 0 191 86
be 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
last 0 191 86
word. 0 191 86

Neither 0 191 87
embraces 0 191 87
nor 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
ghetto 0 191 87
can 0 191 87
resolve 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
problem 0 191 87
of 0 191 87
[relations 0 191 87
with] 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
modern 0 191 87
world 0 191 87
for 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
Christian. 0 191 87

Hence, 0 191 88
the 0 191 88
'razing 0 191 88
of 0 191 88
the 0 191 88
bastions' 0 191 88
that 0 191 88
Hans 0 191 88
Urs 0 191 88
von 0 191 88
Balthasar 0 191 88
called 0 191 88
for 0 191 88
already 0 191 88
in 0 191 88
1952 0 191 88
was 0 191 88
in 0 191 88
effect 0 191 88
an 0 191 88
urgent 0 191 88
duty. 0 191 88

It 0 191 89
was 0 191 89
necessary 0 191 89
for 0 191 89
her 0 191 89
[the 0 191 89
Church] 0 191 89
to 0 191 89
raze 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
old 0 191 89
bastions 0 191 89
and 0 191 89
confide 0 191 89
only 0 191 89
in 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
protection 0 191 89
of 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
faith, 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
power 0 191 89
of 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
word 0 191 89
that 0 191 89
is 0 191 89
her 0 191 89
unique, 0 191 89
true, 0 191 89
and 0 191 89
permanent 0 191 89
strength. 0 191 89

But 0 191 90
to 0 191 90
raze 0 191 90
the 0 191 90
bastions 0 191 90
cannot 0 191 90
signify 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
she 0 191 90
no 0 191 90
longer 0 191 90
has 0 191 90
anything 0 191 90
to 0 191 90
protect, 0 191 90
or 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
she 0 191 90
can 0 191 90
live 0 191 90
owing 0 191 90
to 0 191 90
different 0 191 90
forces 0 191 90
than 0 191 90
those 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
engendered 0 191 90
her: 0 191 90
the 1 191 90
water 1 191 90
and 1 191 90
the 1 191 90
blood 1 191 90
that 1 191 90
poured 1 191 90
from 1 191 90
the 1 191 90
open 1 191 90
side 1 191 90
of 1 191 90
her 1 191 90
crucified 1 191 90
Lord. 1 191 90

His 0 191 91
was 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
thesis 0 191 91
– 0 191 91
a 0 191 91
mainstay 0 191 91
of 0 191 91
“conservative” 0 191 91
ideology 0 191 91
– 0 191 91
that 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
“real” 0 191 91
Council, 0 191 91
if 0 191 91
only 0 191 91
implemented 0 191 91
properly, 0 191 91
would 0 191 91
be 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
salvation 0 191 91
of 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
Church 0 191 91
and 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
world, 0 191 91
a 0 191 91
theme 0 191 91
he 0 191 91
never 0 191 91
left. 0 191 91

How 0 191 92
ironic 0 191 92
it 0 191 92
must 0 191 92
have 0 191 92
seemed 0 191 92
to 0 191 92
those 0 191 92
who 0 191 92
remembered 0 191 92
this 0 191 92
history 0 191 92
that 0 191 92
Ratzinger 0 191 92
would 0 191 92
himself 0 191 92
be 0 191 92
given 0 191 92
the 0 191 92
office 0 191 92
he 0 191 92
had 0 191 92
“destroyed” 0 191 92
and 0 191 92
would 0 191 92
gain 0 191 92
the 0 191 92
media-generated 0 191 92
reputation 0 191 92
as 0 191 92
an 0 191 92
“arch-conservative”. 1 191 92

And 0 191 93
it 0 191 93
starts 0 191 93
to 0 191 93
suggest 0 191 93
an 0 191 93
answer, 0 191 93
or 0 191 93
at 0 191 93
least 0 191 93
a 0 191 93
line 0 191 93
of 0 191 93
inquiry, 0 191 93
about 0 191 93
why 0 191 93
so 0 191 93
little 0 191 93
was 0 191 93
actually 0 191 93
accomplished 0 191 93
in 0 191 93
his 0 191 93
long 0 191 93
tenure. 0 191 93

With 0 191 94
the 0 191 94
“arch-conservative” 1 191 94
“Rottweiler” 1 191 94
Ratzinger 1 191 94
in 0 191 94
CDF, 0 191 94
why 0 191 94
do 0 191 94
we 0 191 94
have 0 191 94
the 0 191 94
situation 0 191 94
we 0 191 94
have 0 191 94
today? 0 191 94

What 0 191 95
did 0 191 95
he 0 191 95
do 0 191 95
to 0 191 95
stop 0 191 95
the 0 191 95
explosion 0 191 95
of 0 191 95
neo-modernism 0 191 95
– 0 191 95
that 0 191 95
burned 1 191 95
like 1 191 95
an 1 191 95
unchecked 1 191 95
wildfire 1 191 95
throughout 1 191 95
the 1 191 95
Catholic 1 191 95
world 1 191 95
through 0 191 95
the 0 191 95
reign 0 191 95
of 0 191 95
John 0 191 95
Paul 0 191 95

II? 0 191 96
What 0 191 96
did 0 191 96
“silencing” 0 191 96
by 0 191 96
Ratzinger’s 0 191 96
CDF 0 191 96
do 0 191 96
to 0 191 96
stop 0 191 96
Hans 0 191 96
Kung 0 191 96
becoming 0 191 96
a 0 191 96
celebrity 1 191 96
“priest-theologian,” 1 191 96
courted 0 191 96
by 0 191 96
the 0 191 96
media 0 191 96
for 0 191 96
his 0 191 96
loathing 0 191 96
of 0 191 96
Catholicism? 0 191 96

Kung, 0 191 97
who 0 191 97
was 0 191 97
never 0 191 97
removed 0 191 97
from 0 191 97
the 0 191 97
priesthood 0 191 97
despite 0 191 97
his 0 191 97
manifest 0 191 97
heresy? 0 191 97

Can 0 191 98
we 0 191 98
think 0 191 98
of 0 191 98
any 0 191 98
other 0 191 98
names 0 191 98
who 0 191 98
were 0 191 98
corrected 0 191 98
even 0 191 98
to 0 191 98
this 0 191 98
degree? 0 191 98

Precious 0 191 99
few. 0 191 99

But 0 191 100
we 0 191 100
can 0 191 100
certainly 0 191 100
think 0 191 100
of 0 191 100
many, 0 191 100
many 0 191 100
who 0 191 100
spent 0 191 100
their 0 191 100
lives 0 191 100
and 0 191 100
vocations 0 191 100
blatantly 1 191 100
denying 1 191 100
and 1 191 100
undermining 1 191 100
the 0 191 100
Catholic 0 191 100
Faith 0 191 100
– 0 191 100
academic 0 191 100
theologians, 0 191 100
religious, 0 191 100
priests, 0 191 100
bishops 0 191 100
and 0 191 100
cardinals 0 191 100
around 0 191 100
the 0 191 100
world 0 191 100
– 0 191 100
with 0 191 100
never 0 191 100
a 0 191 100
peep 0 191 100
of 0 191 100
protest 0 191 100
from 0 191 100
Rome. 0 191 100

Moreover, 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
scandalous 0 191 101
pack 0 191 101
of 0 191 101
frauds 0 191 101
we 0 191 101
currently 0 191 101
have 0 191 101
in 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
episcopate 0 191 101
is 0 191 101
entirely 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
product 0 191 101
of 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
“arch-conservative” 1 191 101
John 0 191 101
Paul 0 191 101
II 0 191 101
and 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
“Rottweiler” 1 191 101
Benedict 1 191 101
XVI 1 191 101
pontificates. 0 191 101

Why 0 191 102
did 0 191 102
we 0 191 102
think 0 191 102
that 0 191 102
Ratzinger, 0 191 102
in 0 191 102
this 0 191 102
crucial 0 191 102
role 0 191 102
of 0 191 102
CDF 0 191 102
prefect, 0 191 102
was 0 191 102
a 0 191 102
bulwark 0 191 102
of 0 191 102
orthodoxy? 0 191 102

Is 0 191 103
it 0 191 103
simply 0 191 103
that 0 191 103
we 0 191 103
have 0 191 103
moved 0 191 103
so 0 191 103
far 0 191 103
away 0 191 103
from 0 191 103
the 0 191 103
ancient 0 191 103
Faith 0 191 103
that 0 191 103
we 0 191 103
no 0 191 103
longer 0 191 103
have 0 191 103
a 0 191 103
realistic 0 191 103
notion 0 191 103
of 0 191 103
the 0 191 103
Faith 0 191 103
ourselves 0 191 103
to 0 191 103
make 0 191 103
a 0 191 103
comparison, 0 191 103
to 0 191 103
make 0 191 103
an 0 191 103
objective 0 191 103
judgement? 0 191 103

The 0 191 104
“progressive” 1 191 104
destroyer 1 191 104
of 1 191 104
Ottaviani 1 191 104
inheriting 0 191 104
his 0 191 104
office 0 191 104
and 0 191 104
the 0 191 104
epithet 0 191 104
“arch-conservative”… 1 191 104

Indeed, 0 191 105
Ratzinger 0 191 105
himself 0 191 105
maintained 0 191 105
that 0 191 105
he 0 191 105
had 0 191 105
never 0 191 105
changed 0 191 105
his 0 191 105
theological 0 191 105
opinions. 0 191 105

He 0 191 106
was 0 191 106
to 0 191 106
say 0 191 106
that 0 191 106
it 0 191 106
was 0 191 106
his 0 191 106
old 0 191 106
academic 0 191 106
colleagues 0 191 106
like 0 191 106
Kung 0 191 106
and 0 191 106
Kasper 0 191 106
who 0 191 106
had 0 191 106
moved 0 191 106
further 0 191 106
to 0 191 106
the 0 191 106
ideological 0 191 106
“left” 0 191 106
after 0 191 106
the 0 191 106
1960s 0 191 106
while 0 191 106
he 0 191 106
stayed 0 191 106
in 0 191 106
place. 0 191 106

Perhaps 0 191 107
now, 0 191 107
as 0 191 107
an 0 191 107
answer 0 191 107
that 0 191 107
fits 0 191 107
our 0 191 107
apparently 0 191 107
contradictory 0 191 107
puzzle 0 191 107
pieces, 0 191 107
we 0 191 107
can 0 191 107
finally 0 191 107
accept 0 191 107
his 0 191 107
word 0 191 107
on 0 191 107
this. 0 191 107

Perhaps 0 191 108
the 0 191 108
world 0 191 108
of 0 191 108
Catholic 0 191 108
academic 0 191 108
theology 0 191 108
had 0 191 108
become 0 191 108
so 0 191 108
corrupted 0 191 108
that 0 191 108
a 1 191 108
man 1 191 108
called 1 191 108
“progressive” 1 191 108
in 0 191 108
1963, 0 191 108
but 0 191 108
whose 0 191 108
ideas 0 191 108
remained 0 191 108
the 0 191 108
same, 0 191 108
would 0 191 108
look 0 191 108
like 0 191 108
a 0 191 108
“champion 0 191 108
of 0 191 108
traditional 0 191 108
Catholic 0 191 108
orthodoxy” 0 191 108
by 0 191 108
2005. 0 191 108

Is 0 191 109
this 0 191 109
why 0 191 109
he 0 191 109
resigned? 0 191 109

Is 0 191 110
it 0 191 110
simply 0 191 110
that 0 191 110
his 0 191 110
conception 0 191 110
of 0 191 110
the 0 191 110
Church, 0 191 110
of 0 191 110
the 0 191 110
papacy, 0 191 110
was 0 191 110
never 0 191 110
what 0 191 110
Catholics 0 191 110
believed 0 191 110
about 0 191 110

it? 0 191 111
Perhaps 0 191 111
a 0 191 111
hint 0 191 111
at 0 191 111
the 0 191 111
answer 0 191 111
comes 0 191 111
from 0 191 111
La 0 191 111
Stampa 0 191 111
in 0 191 111
2015 0 191 111
which 0 191 111
published 0 191 111
some 0 191 111
of 0 191 111
the 0 191 111
memoirs 0 191 111
of 0 191 111
Silvano 0 191 111
Fausti, 0 191 111
SJ, 0 191 111

of 1 191 111
the 1 191 111

the 0 191 111
“Sankt 0 191 111

that 0 191 111
Cardinal 0 191 111
Danneels 0 191 111
admitted 0 191 111

against 0 191 111
Pope 0 191 111
Benedict. 0 191 111

Fausti 0 191 112
said 0 191 112
that 0 191 112
Benedict 0 191 112
met 0 191 112
with 0 191 112
Martini 0 191 112
at 0 191 112
the 0 191 112
bishops’ 0 191 112
palace 0 191 112
of 0 191 112
Milan 0 191 112
in 0 191 112
June 0 191 112
2012. 0 191 112

Martini, 0 191 113
Fausti 0 191 113
said, 0 191 113
urged 0 191 113
Benedict 0 191 113
to 0 191 113
resign 0 191 113
the 0 191 113
papacy. 0 191 113

Apparently 0 191 114
at 0 191 114
the 0 191 114
time 0 191 114
of 0 191 114
his 0 191 114
election 0 191 114
in 0 191 114
2005, 0 191 114
Martini 0 191 114
had 0 191 114
said 0 191 114
it 0 191 114
would 0 191 114
be 0 191 114
his 0 191 114
main 0 191 114
task 0 191 114
to 0 191 114
reform 0 191 114
the 0 191 114
Curia. 0 191 114

By 0 191 115
2012, 0 191 115
this 0 191 115
had 0 191 115
proved 0 191 115
impossible. 0 191 115

Why 0 191 116
would 0 191 116
Benedict 0 191 116
take 0 191 116
advice 0 191 116
from 0 191 116
a 0 191 116
man 0 191 116
like 0 191 116
Martini 0 191 116
– 0 191 116
the 1 191 116
“godfather” 1 191 116
of 1 191 116
the 1 191 116
“liberal 1 191 116
wing” 1 191 116
of 1 191 116
European 1 191 116
Catholicism? 1 191 116

I 0 191 117
think 0 191 117
the 0 191 117
question 0 191 117
would 0 191 117
not 0 191 117
even 0 191 117
occur 0 191 117
to 0 191 117
a 0 191 117
man 0 191 117
like 0 191 117
Ratzinger. 0 191 117

They 0 191 118
were 0 191 118
esteemed 0 191 118
academic 0 191 118
colleagues. 0 191 118

They 0 191 119
were 0 191 119
brothers 0 191 119
of 0 191 119
the 0 191 119
episcopate. 0 191 119

They 0 191 120
were 0 191 120
members 0 191 120
of 0 191 120
the 0 191 120
club. 0 191 120

Any 0 191 121
appearance 0 191 121
of 0 191 121
ideological 0 191 121
division 0 191 121
between 0 191 121
them 0 191 121
was, 0 191 121
in 0 191 121
essence, 0 191 121
a 0 191 121
product 0 191 121
of 0 191 121
the 0 191 121
media 0 191 121
narrative. 0 191 121

Why 0 191 122
wouldn’t 0 191 122
the 0 191 122
pope 0 191 122
take 0 191 122
the 0 191 122
advice 0 191 122
of 0 191 122
his 0 191 122
most 0 191 122
respected 0 191 122
and 0 191 122
senior 0 191 122
cardinal? 0 191 122

Why 0 191 123
is 0 191 123
Walter 0 191 123
Kasper 0 191 123
a 0 191 123
cardinal? 0 191 123

One 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
the 0 191 124
most 0 191 124
prominent 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
those 0 191 124
puzzle 0 191 124
pieces 0 191 124
is 0 191 124
the 0 191 124
apparent 0 191 124
inability 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
these 0 191 124
“conservative” 0 191 124
prelates, 0 191 124
to 0 191 124
detect, 0 191 124
let 0 191 124
alone 0 191 124
effectively 0 191 124
oppose, 0 191 124
these 0 191 124
brazen 1 191 124
enemies 1 191 124
of 1 191 124
the 1 191 124
Faith 1 191 124
within 0 191 124
the 0 191 124
episcopate 0 191 124
and 0 191 124
College 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
Cardinals. 0 191 124

It 0 191 125
beggars 0 191 125
belief 0 191 125
of 0 191 125
ordinary 0 191 125
people 0 191 125
that, 0 191 125
after 0 191 125
so 0 191 125
many 0 191 125
years 0 191 125
of 0 191 125
hearing 0 191 125
and 0 191 125
reading 0 191 125
them, 0 191 125
Ratzinger 0 191 125
would 0 191 125
remain 0 191 125
on 0 191 125
such 0 191 125
friendly 0 191 125
terms 0 191 125
with 0 191 125
men 0 191 125
like 0 191 125

and 0 191 125
Carlo 0 191 125

When, 0 191 126
at 0 191 126
his 0 191 126

first 0 191 126

in 0 191 126
2013, 0 191 126
Pope 0 191 126

told 0 191 126
the 0 191 126
crowd 0 191 126
how 0 191 126
much 0 191 126
he 0 191 126
loved 0 191 126
the 0 191 126
writing 0 191 126
of 0 191 126
Walter 0 191 126
Kasper, 0 191 126
quite 0 191 126
a 0 191 126
lot 0 191 126
of 0 191 126
us 0 191 126
who 0 191 126
had 0 191 126
spent 0 191 126
many 0 191 126
years 0 191 126
watching 0 191 126
the 0 191 126
Vatican 0 191 126

understanding 0 191 126
where 0 191 126
we 0 191 126
were 0 191 126
all 0 191 126
headed 0 191 126
with 0 191 126
the 0 191 126
new 0 191 126
pope. 0 191 126

Jorge 0 191 127
Bergoglio 0 191 127
might 0 191 127
have 0 191 127
been 0 191 127
unknown 0 191 127
to 0 191 127
the 0 191 127
larger 0 191 127
Catholic 0 191 127
world, 0 191 127
but 0 191 127
Walter 0 191 127
Kasper 0 191 127
was 0 191 127
a 0 191 127
celebrity 1 191 127
heretic, 1 191 127
the 0 191 127
media-savvy 1 191 127

In 0 191 128
an 0 191 128
article 0 191 128
on 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
cardinal’s 0 191 128
life’s 0 191 128
work, 0 191 128
Thomas 0 191 128
Jansen, 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
editor-in-chief 0 191 128
of 0 191 128
Katholisch.de, 0 191 128
recently 0 191 128
noted 0 191 128
that 0 191 128
Walter 0 191 128
Kasper 0 191 128
could 0 191 128
not 0 191 128
possibly 0 191 128
have 0 191 128
done 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
damage 0 191 128
he 0 191 128
has 0 191 128
without 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
direct 0 191 128
assistance 0 191 128
of 0 191 128
both 0 191 128
John 0 191 128
Paul 0 191 128
II 0 191 128
and 0 191 128
Pope 0 191 128
Benedict. 0 191 128

The 0 191 129
monstrous 0 191 129
debacle 0 191 129
of 0 191 129
Amoris 0 191 129
Laetitia 0 191 129
is 0 191 129
as 0 191 129
much 0 191 129
Kasper’s 0 191 129
work 0 191 129
as 0 191 129
Bergoglio’s. 0 191 129

This 0 191 130
is 0 191 130
a 0 191 130
man 0 191 130
who 0 191 130
has, 0 191 130
for 0 191 130
40 0 191 130
years, 0 191 130
never 0 191 130
troubled 0 191 130
to 0 191 130
hide 0 191 130
his 0 191 130
heterodox 0 191 130
opinions 0 191 130
and 0 191 130
has 0 191 130
devoted 0 191 130
much 0 191 130
of 0 191 130
his 0 191 130
life 0 191 130
to 0 191 130
a 0 191 130
campaign 0 191 130
to 0 191 130
bring 0 191 130
about 0 191 130
precisely 0 191 130
this 0 191 130
outcome. 0 191 130

Jansen 0 191 131
points 0 191 131
out 0 191 131
that 0 191 131
Kasper 0 191 131
had 0 191 131
already 0 191 131
tried 0 191 131
to 0 191 131
bring 0 191 131
out 0 191 131
the 0 191 131
same 0 191 131
proposal 0 191 131
for 0 191 131
Communion 0 191 131
for 0 191 131
divorced 0 191 131
and 0 191 131
remarried 0 191 131
in 0 191 131
1993, 0 191 131
together 0 191 131
with 0 191 131
Karl 0 191 131
Lehmann, 0 191 131
another 1 191 131
“Sankt 1 191 131
Gallen” 1 191 131
member. 1 191 131

This 0 191 132
was 0 191 132
stopped 0 191 132
by 0 191 132
Ratzinger 0 191 132
and 0 191 132
the 0 191 132
CDF. 0 191 132

But 0 191 133
that 0 191 133
raises 0 191 133
the 0 191 133
next 0 191 133
question; 0 191 133
if 0 191 133
Ratzinger 0 191 133
knew 0 191 133
so 0 191 133
well 0 191 133
what 1 191 133
kind 1 191 133
of 1 191 133
creature 1 191 133
Kasper 1 191 133
was, 1 191 133
why 0 191 133
wasn’t 0 191 133
the 0 191 133
next 0 191 133
step 0 191 133
to 0 191 133
pitch 0 191 133
him 0 191 133
out 0 191 133
of 0 191 133
the 0 191 133
episcopate 0 191 133
on 0 191 133
his 0 191 133
ear? 0 191 133

Why 0 191 134
was 0 191 134
he 0 191 134
not 0 191 134
– 0 191 134
at 0 191 134
the 0 191 134
very 0 191 134
least 0 191 134
– 0 191 134
given 0 191 134
the 0 191 134
same 0 191 134
“silencing” 0 191 134
treatment 0 191 134
as 0 191 134
Kung? 0 191 134

Kasper 0 191 135
has 0 191 135
recently 0 191 135
gone 0 191 135
to 0 191 135
the 0 191 135
media 0 191 135
again 0 191 135
to 0 191 135
complain 0 191 135
of 0 191 135
being 0 191 135
called 0 191 135
a 0 191 135
heretic. 0 191 135

But 0 191 136
it’s 0 191 136
a 0 191 136
simple 0 191 136
truth: 0 191 136
he’s 1 191 136
a 1 191 136
heretic. 1 191 136

Everyone 0 191 137
knows 0 191 137
he’s 0 191 137
a 0 191 137
heretic 0 191 137
because 0 191 137
we 0 191 137
have 0 191 137
heard 0 191 137
him 0 191 137
trumpeting 1 191 137
in 1 191 137
his 1 191 137
blatant 1 191 137
heresies 1 191 137
from 1 191 137
every 1 191 137
rooftop 1 191 137
he 1 191 137
could 1 191 137
find 1 191 137
for 0 191 137
decades. 0 191 137

After 0 191 138
openly 0 191 138
working 0 191 138
against 0 191 138
the 0 191 138
Faith, 0 191 138
instead 0 191 138
of 0 191 138
being 0 191 138
demoted, 0 191 138
silenced, 0 191 138
laicised 0 191 138
and/or 0 191 138
excommunicated, 0 191 138
John 0 191 138
Paul 0 191 138
II 0 191 138
made 0 191 138
him 0 191 138
a 0 191 138
cardinal. 0 191 138

Remember 0 191 139
that 0 191 139
his 0 191 139
scheme 0 191 139
to 0 191 139
Amoris-Latitia-ize 0 191 139
the 0 191 139
Church 0 191 139
was 0 191 139
stopped 0 191 139
by 0 191 139
Ratzinger’s 0 191 139
CDF 0 191 139
in 0 191 139
1993. 0 191 139

But 0 191 140
he 0 191 140
was 0 191 140
not 0 191 140
demoted, 0 191 140
reprimanded 0 191 140
or 0 191 140
corrected 0 191 140
in 0 191 140
any 0 191 140
way. 0 191 140

Nor 0 191 141
was 0 191 141
he 0 191 141
removed 0 191 141
from 0 191 141
places 0 191 141
of 0 191 141
influence. 0 191 141

Far 0 191 142
from 0 191 142

it. 0 191 143
In 0 191 143
1994 0 191 143
Kasper 0 191 143
was 0 191 143
inserted 0 191 143
into 0 191 143
the 0 191 143
Vatican 0 191 143
Curia 0 191 143
by 0 191 143
being 0 191 143
named 0 191 143
co-chair 0 191 143
of 0 191 143
the 0 191 143
International 0 191 143
Commission 0 191 143
for 0 191 143
Lutheran-Catholic 0 191 143
Dialogue. 0 191 143

In 0 191 144
1999, 0 191 144
he 0 191 144
made 0 191 144
another 0 191 144
step 0 191 144
up, 0 191 144
being 0 191 144
appointed 0 191 144
secretary 0 191 144
of 0 191 144
the 0 191 144
Pontifical 0 191 144
Council 0 191 144
for 0 191 144
Promoting 0 191 144
Christian 0 191 144
Unity, 0 191 144
the 0 191 144
“ecumenical” 0 191 144
office 0 191 144
where 0 191 144
his 0 191 144
manifest 0 191 144
religious 0 191 144
indifferentism 0 191 144
could 0 191 144
be 0 191 144
given 0 191 144
free 0 191 144
reign. 0 191 144

In 0 191 145
2001, 0 191 145
he 0 191 145
was 0 191 145
made 0 191 145
a 0 191 145
Cardinal-deacon 0 191 145
with 0 191 145
the 0 191 145
awesome 1 191 145
responsibility 1 191 145
of 0 191 145
voting 0 191 145
in 0 191 145
a 0 191 145
Conclave. 0 191 145

Then 0 191 146
Benedict 0 191 146
allowed 0 191 146
him 0 191 146
to 0 191 146
remain 0 191 146
a 0 191 146
cardinal. 0 191 146

And, 0 191 147
as 0 191 147
if 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
add 0 191 147
a 0 191 147
finishing 1 191 147
touch 1 191 147
to 1 191 147
the 1 191 147
poisoned 1 191 147
cake 1 191 147
that 0 191 147
is 0 191 147
Ratzinger’s 0 191 147
involvement 0 191 147
in 0 191 147
the 0 191 147
creation 0 191 147
of 0 191 147
the 0 191 147
New 0 191 147
Catholic 0 191 147
Paradigm, 0 191 147
Benedict 0 191 147
is 0 191 147
now 0 191 147
being 0 191 147
said 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
have 0 191 147
deliberately 0 191 147
timed 0 191 147
his 0 191 147
resignation 0 191 147
in 0 191 147
order 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
allow 0 191 147

old 0 191 147
academic 0 191 147
colleague 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
participate 0 191 147
in 0 191 147
the 0 191 147
2013 0 191 147
Conclave. 0 191 147

As 0 191 148
Jansen 0 191 148
pointed 0 191 148
out, 0 191 148
and 0 191 148
Maike 0 191 148
Hickson 0 191 148
quoted 0 191 148
in 0 191 148
a 0 191 148
piece 0 191 148
for 0 191 148
One 0 191 148
Peter 0 191 148
Five, 0 191 148

Cardinal 0 191 149
Kasper 0 191 149
barely 0 191 149
even 0 191 149
made 0 191 149
it 0 191 149
into 0 191 149
the 0 191 149
last 0 191 149
conclave, 0 191 149
because 0 191 149
he 0 191 149
had 0 191 149
just 0 191 149
turned 0 191 149
80 0 191 149
years 0 191 149
of 0 191 149
age. 0 191 149

But 0 191 150
since 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
date 0 191 150
of 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
death 0 191 150
(or 0 191 150
abdication, 0 191 150
as 0 191 150
it 0 191 150
was 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
case 0 191 150
in 0 191 150
2013) 0 191 150
of 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
pope 0 191 150
is 0 191 150
decisive, 0 191 150
he 0 191 150
was 0 191 150
still 0 191 150
able 0 191 150
to 0 191 150
attend 0 191 150
and 0 191 150
vote 0 191 150
in 0 191 150
that 0 191 150
election. 0 191 150

(As 0 191 151
some 0 191 151
observers 0 191 151
noted, 0 191 151
it 0 191 151
was 0 191 151
a 0 191 151
generous 0 191 151
gesture 0 191 151
toward 0 191 151
Cardinal 0 191 151
Kasper 0 191 151
that 0 191 151
Pope 0 191 151
Benedict 0 191 151
XVI 0 191 151
had 0 191 151
decided 0 191 151
to 0 191 151
retire 0 191 151
in 0 191 151
due 0 191 151
time.) 0 191 151

Excuse 0 191 152
me 0 191 152
Maike, 0 191 152
but 0 191 152
I 0 191 152
don’t 0 191 152
think 0 191 152
this 0 191 152
is 0 191 152
a 0 191 152
parenthetical 0 191 152
issue. 0 191 152

Is 1 191 153
it 1 191 153
any 1 191 153
wonder 1 191 153
that 1 191 153
so 1 191 153
many 1 191 153
Catholics 1 191 153
have 1 191 153
become 1 191 153
disaffected? 1 191 153

Cardinal 0 191 154
Ratzinger, 0 191 154
Pope 0 191 154
“Emeritus” 0 191 154
Benedict 0 191 154
– 0 191 154
whatever 1 191 154
you 1 191 154
want 1 191 154
to 1 191 154
call 1 191 154
yourself 1 191 154
– 0 191 154
I 0 191 154
have 0 191 154
one 0 191 154
question 0 191 154
that 0 191 154
I 0 191 154
would 0 191 154
really 0 191 154
like 0 191 154
you 0 191 154
to 0 191 154
answer: 0 191 154
Why 1 191 154
is 1 191 154
this 1 191 154
man 1 191 154
still 1 191 154
a 1 191 154
cardinal? 1 191 154

Why 1 191 155
is 1 191 155
he 1 191 155
still 1 191 155
a 1 191 155
bishop? 1 191 155

Why 1 191 156
is 1 191 156
he 1 191 156
still 1 191 156
allowed 1 191 156
to 1 191 156
call 1 191 156
himself 1 191 156
a 1 191 156
“Catholic 1 191 156
theologian”? 1 191 156

Why 1 191 157
did 1 191 157
you, 1 191 157
apparently 1 191 157
deliberately, 1 191 157
ensure 1 191 157
that 1 191 157
he 1 191 157
was 1 191 157
able 1 191 157
to 1 191 157
enter 1 191 157
the 1 191 157
Conclave 1 191 157
to 1 191 157
decide 1 191 157
who 1 191 157
your 1 191 157
successor 1 191 157
was 1 191 157
going 1 191 157
to 1 191 157

be? 1 191 158
Doesn’t 0 191 158
anyone 0 191 158
else 0 191 158
want 0 191 158
to 0 191 158
know 0 191 158
this? 0 191 158

Don’t 0 191 159
we 0 191 159
all 0 191 159
want 0 191 159
to 0 191 159
know 0 191 159
why 0 191 159
Hans 0 191 159
Kung 0 191 159
is 0 191 159
still 0 191 159
a 0 191 159
priest? 0 191 159

Why 0 191 160
was 0 191 160
Cardinal 0 191 160
Mahony 0 191 160
allowed 0 191 160
to 0 191 160
retire 0 191 160
in 0 191 160
good 0 191 160
standing? 0 191 160

Why 0 191 161
a 0 191 161
man 0 191 161
like 0 191 161
Weakland, 0 191 161
the 0 191 161
active 1 191 161
homosexual 1 191 161
who 0 191 161
paid 0 191 161
off 0 191 161
his 0 191 161
ex-lover, 0 191 161
was 0 191 161
not 0 191 161
excommunicated? 0 191 161

What 0 191 162
are 0 191 162
the 0 191 162
names 0 191 162
we 0 191 162
all 0 191 162
remember, 0 191 162
just 0 191 162
off 0 191 162
the 0 191 162
top 0 191 162
of 0 191 162
our 0 191 162
heads? 0 191 162

My 0 191 163
own 0 191 163
bishop 0 191 163
in 0 191 163
Victoria, 0 191 163

Derek 0 191 163
Worlock 0 191 163
of 0 191 163
Liverpool… 0 191 163
I 0 191 163
sometimes 0 191 163
wonder 0 191 163
how 0 191 163
long 0 191 163
that 0 191 163
list 0 191 163
is 0 191 163
going 0 191 163
to 0 191 163
be 0 191 163
when 0 191 163
this 0 191 163
is 0 191 163
all 0 191 163
over. 0 191 163

For 0 191 164
fifty 0 191 164
years 0 191 164
Catholics 0 191 164
have 0 191 164
wanted 0 191 164
to 0 191 164
know 0 191 164
why 0 191 164
nothing 0 191 164
was 0 191 164
ever 0 191 164
done, 0 191 164
as 0 191 164
these 0 191 164
wolves 1 191 164
in 1 191 164
the 1 191 164
episcopate 1 191 164
were 0 191 164
allowed, 0 191 164
year 0 191 164
after 0 191 164
year 0 191 164
to 0 191 164
continue 0 191 164
attacking 0 191 164
the 0 191 164
Church. 0 191 164

Why 1 191 165
have 1 191 165
we 1 191 165
so 1 191 165
often 1 191 165
seen 1 191 165
these 1 191 165
men 1 191 165
– 1 191 165
compromised 1 191 165
intellectually 1 191 165
and 1 191 165
morally 1 191 165
– 1 191 165
elevated 1 191 165
to 1 191 165
superior 1 191 165
rank, 1 191 165
despite 1 191 165
the 1 191 165
incredible 1 191 165
brazenness 1 191 165
of 1 191 165
their 1 191 165
hatred 1 191 165
of 1 191 165
the 1 191 165
Catholic 1 191 165
Faith? 1 191 165

The 0 191 166
end 0 191 166
of 0 191 166

those 0 191 167
who 0 191 167
are 0 191 167
starting 0 191 167
to 0 191 167
ask 0 191 167
these 0 191 167
kinds 0 191 167
of 0 191 167
questions. 0 191 167

Maike 0 191 168
Hickson 0 191 168
quotes 0 191 168
him, 0 191 168
writing 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
this 0 191 168
bizarre 0 191 168
situation 0 191 168
– 0 191 168
in 0 191 168
which 0 191 168
each, 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
the 0 191 168
so-called 0 191 168
“Sankt 1 191 168
Gallen 1 191 168
Mafia” 1 191 168
prelates, 1 191 168
including 0 191 168
Kasper, 0 191 168
who 0 191 168
openly 0 191 168
campaigned 0 191 168
for 0 191 168
the 0 191 168
effective 0 191 168
abolition 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
Catholic 0 191 168
moral 0 191 168
teaching: 0 191 168
“It 0 191 168
was 0 191 168
characteristic 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
the 0 191 168
church’s 0 191 168
effective 0 191 168
truce 0 191 168
[between 0 191 168
conservatives 0 191 168
and 0 191 168
progressivists] 0 191 168
that 0 191 168
John 0 191 168
Paul 0 191 168
II 0 191 168
himself 0 191 168
had 0 191 168
given 0 191 168
most 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
them 0 191 168
their 0 191 168
red 0 191 168
hats, 0 191 168

them 0 191 168

their 0 191 168
disagreement 0 191 168
with 0 191 168
his 0 191 168
restorationist 0 191 168
approach.” 0 191 168

When 0 191 169
journalists 0 191 169
talk 0 191 169
about 0 191 169
Catholicism, 0 191 169
they 0 191 169
often 0 191 169
speak 0 191 169
of 0 191 169
a 0 191 169
man 0 191 169
like 0 191 169
Kasper 0 191 169
being 0 191 169
– 0 191 169
as 0 191 169
his 0 191 169
Wikipedia 0 191 169
page 0 191 169
puts 0 191 169
it 0 191 169

this 0 191 169
is 0 191 169

to 0 191 169
accept 0 191 169

the 0 191 169

and 0 191 170
they’re 0 191 170
both 0 191 170
Catholic. 0 191 170

Steve 0 191 171
Skojec 0 191 171
told 0 191 171
me 0 191 171
that 0 191 171
our 0 191 171
willingness 0 191 171
to 0 191 171
go 0 191 171
along 0 191 171
with 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
whole 0 191 171
“emeritus 1 191 171
pope” 1 191 171
charade 1 191 171
was 0 191 171
an 0 191 171
error: 0 191 171
“I 0 191 171
think 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
problem 0 191 171
is 0 191 171
that 0 191 171
we 0 191 171
all 0 191 171
went 0 191 171
along 0 191 171
with 0 191 171
their 0 191 171
game 0 191 171
of 0 191 171
make 0 191 171
believe, 0 191 171
and 0 191 171
we 0 191 171
shouldn’t 0 191 171
have.” 0 191 171
In 0 191 171
fact, 0 191 171
I 0 191 171
am 0 191 171
starting 0 191 171
to 0 191 171
think 0 191 171
that 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
willingness 0 191 171
of 0 191 171
most 0 191 171
Catholics 0 191 171
to 0 191 171
go 0 191 171
along 0 191 171
with 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
entire 0 191 171
charade 1 191 171
of 1 191 171
post-conciliar 1 191 171
Catholicism 1 191 171
has 0 191 171
been 0 191 171
a 0 191 171
grave 0 191 171
error. 0 191 171

By 0 191 172
playing 0 191 172
along, 0 191 172
by 0 191 172
pretending 0 191 172
that 0 191 172
we 0 191 172
could 0 191 172
be 0 191 172
“conservative 0 191 172
Catholics” 0 191 172
in 0 191 172
this 0 191 172
New 0 191 172
Paradigm 0 191 172
that 0 191 172
also 0 191 172
includes 0 191 172
“liberal 0 191 172
Catholics” 0 191 172
we 0 191 172
have 0 191 172
helped 0 191 172
them 0 191 172
perpetrate 0 191 172
one 0 191 172
the 0 191 172
most 0 191 172
monstrous 0 191 172
frauds 0 191 172
in 0 191 172
human 0 191 172
history. 0 191 172

Because 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
this 0 191 173
schizophrenic 1 191 173
mindset 1 191 173
of 1 191 173
the 1 191 173
Church’s 1 191 173
leadership 1 191 173
since 0 191 173
1965, 0 191 173
we 0 191 173
have 0 191 173
all 0 191 173
come 0 191 173
to 0 191 173
accept 0 191 173
the 0 191 173
underlying 0 191 173
premise; 0 191 173
that 0 191 173
the 0 191 173
Church 0 191 173
is 0 191 173
a 0 191 173
“big 0 191 173
umbrella” 0 191 173
with 0 191 173
plenty 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
room 0 191 173
for 0 191 173
people 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
all 0 191 173
personal 0 191 173
opinions, 0 191 173
that 0 191 173
such 0 191 173
issues 0 191 173
as 0 191 173
liturgy 0 191 173
are 0 191 173
matters 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
personal 0 191 173
“taste” 0 191 173
…that 0 191 173
two 0 191 173
opposed 0 191 173
things 0 191 173
can 0 191 173
both 0 191 173
be 0 191 173
Catholic 0 191 173
truth. 0 191 173

This 0 191 174
schizophrenia 1 191 174
is 0 191 174
the 0 191 174
model 0 191 174
under 0 191 174
which 0 191 174
“conservatives” 0 191 174
have 0 191 174
operated 0 191 174
all 0 191 174
this 0 191 174
time, 0 191 174
and 0 191 174
by 0 191 174
which 0 191 174
they 0 191 174
have 0 191 174
judged 0 191 174
a 0 191 174
man 0 191 174
like 0 191 174
Joseph 0 191 174
Ratzinger 0 191 174
to 0 191 174
be 0 191 174
a 0 191 174
“conservative 1 191 174
champion 1 191 174
of 1 191 174
orthodoxy.” 1 191 174
And 0 191 174
what 0 191 174
has 0 191 174
this 0 191 174
achieved? 0 191 174

It 0 191 175
created 0 191 175
cover 0 191 175
for 0 191 175
the 0 191 175
men 0 191 175
of 0 191 175
Kasper’s 0 191 175
clique 0 191 175
to 0 191 175
maneuver 0 191 175
their 0 191 175
man 0 191 175
on 0 191 175
the 0 191 175
throne 0 191 175
of 0 191 175
Peter 0 191 175
five 0 191 175
years 0 191 175
ago. 0 191 175

And 0 191 176
just 0 191 176
like 0 191 176
that, 0 191 176
the 0 191 176
jargon 0 191 176
of 0 191 176
“tolerance” 0 191 176
and 0 191 176
the 0 191 176
“big 0 191 176
umbrella” 0 191 176
is 0 191 176
over 0 191 176
and 0 191 176
the 0 191 176
purge 0 191 176
of 0 191 176
faithful, 0 191 176
believing 0 191 176
Catholic 0 191 176
religious, 0 191 176
seminarians, 0 191 176
priests, 0 191 176
and 0 191 176
academics 0 191 176
has 0 191 176
begun. 0 191 176

As 0 191 177
it 0 191 177
had 0 191 177

to. 0 191 178
They, 0 191 178
at 0 191 178
least, 0 191 178
do 0 191 178
not 0 191 178
harbour 0 191 178
this 0 191 178
insane 0 191 178
contradiction, 0 191 178
and 0 191 178
understand 0 191 178
– 0 191 178
and 0 191 178
frequently 0 191 178
say 0 191 178
out 0 191 178
loud 0 191 178
– 0 191 178
that 0 191 178
the 0 191 178
New 0 191 178
Paradigm 0 191 178
and 0 191 178
the 0 191 178
Catholic 0 191 178
Church 0 191 178
are 0 191 178
not 0 191 178
the 0 191 178
same. 0 191 178

And 0 191 179
their 0 191 179
New 0 191 179
Church 0 191 179
is 0 191 179
the 0 191 179
only 0 191 179
one 0 191 179
left. 0 191 179

For 0 191 180
five 0 191 180
decades 0 191 180
we 1 191 180
played 1 191 180
the 1 191 180
Anglican 1 191 180
game; 1 191 180
as 0 191 180
long 0 191 180
as 0 191 180
we 0 191 180
don’t 0 191 180
talk 0 191 180
about 0 191 180
it, 0 191 180
there 0 191 180
isn’t 0 191 180
a 0 191 180
problem. 0 191 180

Ottaviani’s 0 191 181
Holy 0 191 181
Office 0 191 181
and 0 191 181
schema 0 191 181
were 0 191 181
the 1 191 181
last 1 191 181
gasp 1 191 181
of 1 191 181
the 1 191 181
old 1 191 181
Church 1 191 181
– 0 191 181
and 0 191 181
as 0 191 181
de 0 191 181
Lubac 0 191 181
said 0 191 181
above, 0 191 181
it 0 191 181
was 0 191 181
killed 0 191 181
by 0 191 181
Joseph 0 191 181
Ratzinger. 0 191 181

We 0 191 182
had 0 191 182
a 0 191 182
long 0 191 182
hiatus 0 191 182
in 0 191 182
which 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
popes 0 191 182
pretended 0 191 182
nothing 0 191 182
essential 0 191 182
had 0 191 182
changed, 0 191 182
while 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
institution 0 191 182
around 0 191 182
them 0 191 182
fell 0 191 182
to 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
New 0 191 182
Paradigm, 0 191 182
until 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
papacy 0 191 182
was 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
only 0 191 182
thing 0 191 182
left. 0 191 182

One 0 191 183
of 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
things 0 191 183
I’ve 0 191 183
been 0 191 183
saying 0 191 183
is 0 191 183
a 0 191 183
blessing 0 191 183
in 0 191 183
disguise, 0 191 183
and 0 191 183
an 0 191 183
enormous 0 191 183
relief, 0 191 183
about 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
Bergoglian 0 191 183
era 0 191 183
is 0 191 183
that 0 191 183
we 0 191 183
can 0 191 183
finally 0 191 183
leave 0 191 183
behind 0 191 183
us 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
absurd 0 191 183
situation 0 191 183
of 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
Wojtyla/Ratzinger 0 191 183
era. 0 191 183

We 0 191 184
were 0 191 184
expected 0 191 184
for 0 191 184
all 0 191 184
those 0 191 184
years 0 191 184
to 0 191 184
pretend 0 191 184
we 0 191 184
were 0 191 184
in 0 191 184
the 0 191 184
“New 0 191 184
Springtime 0 191 184
of 0 191 184
Vatican 0 191 184
II,” 0 191 184
while 0 191 184
we 0 191 184
watched 0 191 184
these 0 191 184
wolves 1 191 184
in 1 191 184
shepherds’ 1 191 184
clothing 1 191 184
eating 1 191 184
the 1 191 184
sheep. 1 191 184

Now 0 191 185
we 0 191 185
can, 0 191 185
at 0 191 185
least, 0 191 185
finally 0 191 185
stop 0 191 185
pretending 0 191 185
that 0 191 185
everything 0 191 185
is 0 191 185
just 0 191 185
dandy 0 191 185
under 0 191 185
the 0 191 185
New 1 191 185
Paradigm 1 191 185
of 1 191 185
Merciful 1 191 185
Conciliar 1 191 185
Wonderfulness. 1 191 185

For 0 191 186
those 0 191 186
still 0 191 186
wondering, 0 191 186
Bergoglio 0 191 186
isn’t 0 191 186
a 0 191 186
shock, 0 191 186
he 0 191 186
isn’t 0 191 186
even 0 191 186
a 0 191 186
surprise; 0 191 186
he’s 0 191 186
just 0 191 186
the 0 191 186
logical 0 191 186
end 0 191 186
result. 0 191 186

This 0 191 186

pontificate 0 191 186

isn’t 0 191 186

an 0 191 186

anomaly; 0 191 186

it 0 191 186

was 0 191 186

the 0 191 186

only 0 191 186

possible 0 191 186

outcome, 0 191 186

and 0 191 186

it 0 191 186

was 0 191 186

as 0 191 186

much 0 191 186

the 0 191 186

work 0 191 186

of 0 191 186

what 0 192 1
has 0 192 1
appeared 0 192 1
for 0 192 1
months 0 192 1

This 0 192 7
is 0 192 7
yet 0 192 7
another 0 192 7
big 0 192 7
shake-up 0 192 7
for 0 192 7
Trump’s 0 192 7
still-young 0 192 7
administration 0 192 7
— 0 192 7

it 1 192 7
may 1 192 7

one 1 192 7
to 1 192 7

The 1 192 8
move 1 192 8
creates 1 192 8
some 1 192 8
big 1 192 8
questions 1 192 8

State, 1 192 9
you’ll 1 192 9
like 1 192 9
Pompeo’s. 1 192 9

Like 0 192 10
Clinton 0 192 10
and 0 192 10
her 0 192 10
Democrat 0 192 10
allies, 0 192 10
Pompeo 0 192 10
has 0 192 10
long 0 192 10
subscribed 0 192 10
to 0 192 10
the 0 192 10
belief 0 192 10
that 0 192 10
Russia 0 192 10
is 1 192 10
perpetually 1 192 10
meddling 1 192 10
in 0 192 10
U.S. 0 192 10
affairs. 0 192 10

In 0 192 11
fact, 0 192 11
he 1 192 11
believes 1 192 11
Barack 1 192 11
Obama 1 192 11
got 1 192 11
Russian 1 192 11
help 1 192 11
too. 1 192 11

While 0 192 12
he 0 192 12
was 0 192 12
being 0 192 12
confirmed 0 192 12
as 0 192 12
CIA 0 192 12
chief, 0 192 12
the 0 192 12
former 0 192 12
lawmaker 0 192 12
lashed 1 192 12
out 1 192 12
at 1 192 12
Russia 1 192 12
for 0 192 12
reasserting 1 192 12
” 1 192 12
itself 1 192 12
aggressively, 1 192 12
invading 1 192 12
and 1 192 12
occupying 1 192 12
Ukraine, 1 192 12
threatening 1 192 12
Europe, 1 192 12
and 1 192 12
doing 1 192 12
nearly 1 192 12
nothing 1 192 12
to 1 192 12
aid 1 192 12
in 1 192 12
the 1 192 12
destruction 1 192 12
and 1 192 12
defeat 1 192 12
of 1 192 12
ISIS.” 1 192 12

Again, 0 192 13
if 0 192 13
you 0 192 13
liked 0 192 13
Obama-era, 0 192 13
world-on-fire, 0 192 13
Russians 0 192 13
everywhere 0 192 13
State 1 192 13
Department 1 192 13
shenanigans, 1 192 13
this 1 192 13
is 1 192 13
your 1 192 13
guy. 1 192 13

Pompeo 1 192 14
also 1 192 14
isn’t 1 192 14
a 1 192 14
huge 1 192 14
fan 1 192 14
of 1 192 14
calling 1 192 14
the 1 192 14
federal 1 192 14
government 1 192 14
out 1 192 14
when 1 192 14
it 1 192 14
is 1 192 14
clearly 1 192 14
violating 1 192 14
the 1 192 14
rights 1 192 14
of 1 192 14
Americans, 1 192 14
as 0 192 14
shown 0 192 14
by 0 192 14
his 0 192 14
statements 0 192 14
last 0 192 14
year 0 192 14
regarding 0 192 14
WikiLeaks. 0 192 14

“It 0 192 15
is 0 192 15
time 0 192 15
to 0 192 15

out 0 192 15
WikiLeaks 0 192 15
for 0 192 15
what 0 192 15
it 0 192 15
really 0 192 15
is 0 192 15
– 0 192 15
a 1 192 15
non-state 1 192 15
hostile 1 192 15

by 0 192 15
state 0 192 15
actors 0 192 15
like 0 192 15
Russia. 0 192 15

In 0 192 16
January 0 192 16
of 0 192 16
this 0 192 16
year, 0 192 16
our 0 192 16
Intelligence 0 192 16
Community 0 192 16
determined 0 192 16
that 0 192 16
Russian 0 192 16
military 0 192 16
intelligence 0 192 16
— 0 192 16
the 0 192 16
GRU 0 192 16
— 0 192 16
had 0 192 16
used 0 192 16
WikiLeaks 0 192 16
to 0 192 16
release 0 192 16
data 0 192 16
of 0 192 16
U.S. 0 192 16
victims 0 192 16
that 0 192 16
the 0 192 16
GRU 0 192 16

against 0 192 16
the 0 192 16
Democratic 0 192 16

Committee. 0 192 16

And 0 192 17
the 0 192 17
report 0 192 17
also 0 192 17
found 0 192 17
that 0 192 17
Russia’s 0 192 17
primary 0 192 17

Moving 0 192 20

who 0 192 20
will 0 192 20
now 0 192 20
be 0 192 20

nothing’s 1 192 20
looking 1 192 20
any 1 192 20
brighter. 1 192 20

She’s 1 192 21
a 1 192 21
big 1 192 21
fan 1 192 21
of 1 192 21
torture, 1 192 21
according 0 192 21
to 0 192 21
a 0 192 21
2013 0 192 21
Washington 0 192 21

IN 0 192 22
MAY 0 192 22
2013, 0 192 22
the 0 192 22
Washington 0 192 22
Post’s 0 192 22
Greg 0 192 22
Miller 0 192 22
reported 0 192 22
that 0 192 22

the 0 192 22
CIA’s 0 192 22
clandestine 0 192 22

was 0 192 22
being 0 192 22
shifted 0 192 22
out 0 192 22
of 0 192 22
that 0 192 22
position 0 192 22
as 0 192 22
a 0 192 22
result 0 192 22
of 0 192 22
“a 0 192 22
management 0 192 22
shake-up” 0 192 22
by 0 192 22
then-Director 0 192 22
John 0 192 22
Brennan. 0 192 22

As 0 192 23
Miller 0 192 23
documented, 0 192 23
this 0 192 23
official 0 192 23
— 0 192 23
whom 0 192 23
the 0 192 23
paper 0 192 23
did 0 192 23
not 0 192 23
name 0 192 23
because 0 192 23
she 0 192 23
was 0 192 23
a 0 192 23
covert 0 192 23
agent 0 192 23
at 0 192 23
the 0 192 23
time 0 192 23
— 0 192 23
was 0 192 23
centrally 0 192 23
involved 0 192 23
in 0 192 23
the 1 192 23
worst 1 192 23
abuses 1 192 23
of 1 192 23
the 1 192 23
CIA’s 1 192 23
Bush-era 1 192 23
torture 1 192 23
regime. 1 192 23

As 0 192 24
Miller 0 192 24
put 0 192 24
it, 0 192 24
she 0 192 24
was 0 192 24
“directly 0 192 24
involved 0 192 24
in 0 192 24
its 0 192 24
controversial 0 192 24
interrogation 0 192 24
program” 0 192 24
and 0 192 24
had 0 192 24
an 0 192 24
“extensive 0 192 24
role” 0 192 24
in 0 192 24
torturing 0 192 24
detainees. 0 192 24

Even 0 192 25
more 0 192 25
troubling, 0 192 25
she 0 192 25
“had 0 192 25
run 0 192 25
a 0 192 25
secret 0 192 25
prison 0 192 25
in 0 192 25
Thailand” 0 192 25
— 0 192 25
part 0 192 25
of 0 192 25
the 0 192 25
CIA’s 0 192 25
network 0 192 25
of 0 192 25
“black 0 192 25
sites” 0 192 25
— 0 192 25
“where 0 192 25
two 0 192 25
detainees 0 192 25
were 0 192 25
subjected 0 192 25
to 0 192 25
waterboarding 0 192 25
and 0 192 25
other 0 192 25
harsh 1 192 25
techniques.” 1 192 25
The 0 192 25
Senate 0 192 25
Intelligence 0 192 25
Committee’s 0 192 25
report 0 192 25
on 0 192 25
torture 0 192 25
also 0 192 25
detailed 0 192 25
the 0 192 25
central 0 192 25
role 0 192 25
she 0 192 25
played 0 192 25
in 0 192 25
the 0 192 25
particularly 1 192 25
gruesome 1 192 25
torture 1 192 25
of 0 192 25
detainee 0 192 25
Abu 0 192 25
Zubaydah. 0 192 25

Beyond 0 192 26
all 0 192 26
that, 0 192 26
she 0 192 26
played 0 192 26
a 0 192 26
vital 0 192 26
role 0 192 26
in 0 192 26
the 0 192 26
destruction 0 192 26
of 0 192 26
interrogation 0 192 26
videotapes 0 192 26
that 0 192 26
showed 0 192 26
the 0 192 26
torture 0 192 26
of 0 192 26
detainees 0 192 26
both 0 192 26
at 0 192 26
the 0 192 26
black 0 192 26

she 0 192 26
ran 0 192 26

The 0 192 27
concealment 0 192 27
of 0 192 27

multiple 0 192 27

is 1 199 3

“Face 0 199 3

“I 0 199 4
frankly 0 199 4
think 0 199 4
that 0 199 4

are 0 199 4
too 0 199 4

"I 0 199 5
don't 0 199 5

so 0 199 5
I 0 199 5

He's 0 199 6
right, 0 199 6

and 0 199 8
the 0 199 8
truth 0 199 8
is 0 199 8
that 0 199 8

that 1 199 18

only 0 199 23
thing 0 199 23
I 0 199 23
can 0 199 23
think 0 199 23
for 0 199 23
that 0 199 23
kind 0 199 23
of 0 199 23
reasoning 0 199 23
is 0 199 23
that 0 199 23
people 1 199 23
do 1 199 23
not 1 199 23
know 1 199 23
their 1 199 23
Constitution 1 199 23
and 1 199 23
understand 1 199 23
exactly 1 199 23
what 1 199 23
Senator 1 199 23
Paul 1 199 23
is 1 199 23
trying 1 199 23
to 1 199 23
warn 1 199 23
America 1 199 23
about. 1 199 23

Instead, 0 199 24
people 0 199 24
are 0 199 24
acting 0 199 24
out 0 199 24
of 0 199 24
emotion 0 199 24
and 0 199 24
fear. 0 199 24

Do 0 199 25
I 0 199 25
believe 0 199 25
we 0 199 25
should 0 199 25
be 0 199 25
concerned 0 199 25
about 0 199 25
North 0 199 25
Korea? 0 199 25

Sure, 0 199 26
but 0 199 26
I'm 0 199 26
hardly 0 199 26
worried 0 199 26
that 0 199 26
they 0 199 26
will 0 199 26
actually 0 199 26
attack 0 199 26
us. 0 199 26

Am 0 199 27
I 0 199 27
concerned 0 199 27
about 0 199 27
jihadis? 0 199 27

Yep, 0 199 28
but 0 199 28
I'm 0 199 28
not 0 199 28
sure 0 199 28
I've 0 199 28
seen 0 199 28
any 0 199 28
real 0 199 28
hard 0 199 28
evidence 0 199 28
that 0 199 28
torturing 0 199 28
them 0 199 28
has 0 199 28
produced 0 199 28
any 0 199 28
information 0 199 28
that 0 199 28
has 0 199 28
led 0 199 28
to 0 199 28
stopping 0 199 28
terror 0 199 28
attacks. 0 199 28

And 0 199 29
before 0 199 29
you 0 199 29
tell 0 199 29
me 0 199 29
about 0 199 29
the 0 199 29
media 0 199 29
reports 0 199 29
and 0 199 29
CIA 0 199 29
involvement, 0 199 29
just 0 199 29
keep 0 199 29
in 0 199 29
mind 0 199 29
that 0 199 29
a 1 199 29
former 1 199 29
journalist, 1 199 29
who 1 199 29
is 1 199 29
now 1 199 29
dead, 1 199 29
told 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
world 1 199 29
that 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
media 1 199 29
lies 1 199 29
for 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
CIA. 1 199 29

So, 1 199 30
I'm 1 199 30
wary 1 199 30
of 1 199 30
media 1 199 30
reports 1 199 30
that 1 199 30
claim 1 199 30
there 1 199 30
have 1 199 30
been 1 199 30
results 1 199 30
from 1 199 30
the 1 199 30
tactics 1 199 30
used. 1 199 30

Trump 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
obviously 1 199 31
had 1 199 31
praise 1 199 31
for 1 199 31
both 1 199 31
Pompeo 1 199 31
and 1 199 31
Haspel, 1 199 31
but 1 199 31
then 1 199 31
again, 1 199 31
his 1 199 31
administration 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
quite 1 199 31
a 1 199 31
bit 1 199 31
of 1 199 31
turn 1 199 31
over 1 199 31
too. 1 199 31

Mike 0 199 32
Pompeo, 0 199 32
Director 0 199 32
of 0 199 32
the 0 199 32
CIA, 0 199 32
will 0 199 32

our 0 199 32
new 0 199 32
Secretary 0 199 32
of 0 199 32
State. 0 199 32

He 1 199 33
will 1 199 33
do 1 199 33
a 1 199 33
fantastic 1 199 33
job! 1 199 33

Thank 0 199 34
you 0 199 34
to 0 199 34
Rex 0 199 34

for 0 199 34
his 0 199 34

will 0 199 35

new 0 199 35

the 0 205 5
question 0 205 5
is, 0 205 5
why. 0 205 5

Why 0 205 6
was 0 205 6
he 0 205 6
there? 0 205 6

What 0 205 7
led 0 205 7
him 0 205 7
there? 0 205 7

And 0 205 8
we 0 205 8
don’t 0 205 8
know 0 205 8
answers 0 205 8
to 0 205 8
that, 0 205 8
quite 0 205 8
frankly.” 0 205 8

The 0 205 9
Times 0 205 9
noted 0 205 9
that 0 205 9
when 0 205 9
emergency 0 205 9
responders 0 205 9
approached 0 205 9
the 0 205 9
burning 0 205 9
van 0 205 9
after 0 205 9
it 0 205 9
crashed, 0 205 9
“they 0 205 9
found 0 205 9
five 0 205 9
propane 0 205 9
tanks, 0 205 9
three 0 205 9
plastic 0 205 9
one-gallon 0 205 9
gas 0 205 9
cans, 0 205 9
several 0 205 9
lighters, 0 205 9
three 0 205 9
phones 0 205 9
and 0 205 9
a 0 205 9
gym 0 205 9
bag 0 205 9
with 0 205 9
personal 0 205 9
items, 0 205 9
Ragan 0 205 9
said.” 0 205 9

Yes, 0 205 10
what 0 205 10
Kazi 0 205 10
could 0 205 10
possibly 0 205 10
have 0 205 10
been 0 205 10
up 0 205 10
to 0 205 10
is 0 205 10
a 0 205 10
complete 0 205 10
mystery. 0 205 10

The 0 205 11
Times 0 205 11
added 0 205 11
that 0 205 11
“the 0 205 11
dead 0 205 11
man’s 0 205 11
religious 0 205 11
beliefs 0 205 11
and 0 205 11
affiliation 0 205 11
are 0 205 11
not 0 205 11
known 0 205 11
at 0 205 11
this 0 205 11
point, 0 205 11
said 0 205 11
Ragan, 0 205 11
who 0 205 11
debunked 0 205 11
a 0 205 11
rumor 0 205 11
that 0 205 11
some 0 205 11
sort 0 205 11
of 0 205 11
‘jihad’ 0 205 11
video 0 205 11
was 0 205 11
found 0 205 11
on 0 205 11
Kazi’s 0 205 11
phone.” 0 205 11

All 0 205 12
right. 0 205 12

No 0 205 13
jihad 0 205 13
video. 0 205 13

And 0 205 14
no 0 205 14
“nexus 0 205 14
of 0 205 14
terrorism,” 0 205 14
according 0 205 14
to 0 205 14
Sean 0 205 14
Ragan. 0 205 14

What 0 205 15
is 0 205 15
a 0 205 15
nexus 0 205 15
of 0 205 15
terrorism? 0 205 15

Ragan 1 205 16
most 1 205 16
likely 1 205 16
means 1 205 16
that 1 205 16
investigators 1 205 16
didn’t 1 205 16
find 1 205 16
an 1 205 16
ISIS 1 205 16
membership 1 205 16
card 1 205 16
in 1 205 16
Kazi’s 1 205 16
wallet, 1 205 16
or 1 205 16
lots 1 205 16
of 1 205 16
phone 1 205 16
calls 1 205 16
to 1 205 16
Iraq 1 205 16
or 1 205 16
Syria, 1 205 16
or 1 205 16
a 1 205 16
note 1 205 16
from 1 205 16
Kazi 1 205 16
reading, 1 205 16
“I 1 205 16
did 1 205 16
this 1 205 16
for 1 205 16
Allah 1 205 16
and 1 205 16
Islam. 1 205 16

Allahu 1 205 17
akbar.” 1 205 17

Of 0 205 18
course, 0 205 18
even 0 205 18
if 0 205 18
they 0 205 18
had 0 205 18
found 0 205 18
those 0 205 18
things, 0 205 18
given 0 205 18
the 0 205 18
FBI’s 0 205 18
recent 0 205 18
track 0 205 18
record 0 205 18
of 0 205 18
denial 0 205 18
and 0 205 18
deception, 0 205 18
they 0 205 18
may 0 205 18
still 0 205 18
be 0 205 18
searching 0 205 18
for 0 205 18
Kazi’s 0 205 18
motive. 0 205 18

In 0 205 19
any 0 205 19
case, 0 205 19
a 0 205 19
larger 0 205 19
point 0 205 19
is 0 205 19
being 0 205 19
lost 0 205 19
here. 0 205 19

And 0 205 20
that 0 205 20
is 0 205 20
that 0 205 20
there 0 205 20
is 0 205 20
a 0 205 20
war 0 205 20
going 0 205 20
on. 0 205 20

We 1 205 21
know 1 205 21
that 1 205 21
the 1 205 21
Islamic 1 205 21
State, 1 205 21
al-Qaeda 1 205 21
and 1 205 21
other 1 205 21
groups 1 205 21
have 1 205 21
called 1 205 21
upon 1 205 21
Muslims 1 205 21
in 1 205 21
the 1 205 21
U.S. 1 205 21
to 1 205 21
try 1 205 21
to 1 205 21
kill 1 205 21
military 1 205 21
personnel 1 205 21
and 1 205 21
police, 1 205 21
as 1 205 21
well 1 205 21
as 1 205 21
civilians. 1 205 21

We 0 205 22
know 0 205 22
that 0 205 22
Kazi, 0 205 22
with 0 205 22
all 0 205 22
the 0 205 22
propane 0 205 22
and 0 205 22
gas 0 205 22
tanks 0 205 22
in 0 205 22
his 0 205 22
car, 0 205 22
was 0 205 22
clearly 0 205 22
trying 0 205 22
to 0 205 22
set 0 205 22
off 0 205 22
a 0 205 22
major 0 205 22
fire 0 205 22
that 0 205 22
would 0 205 22
kill 0 205 22
more 0 205 22
people 0 205 22
than 0 205 22
just 0 205 22
himself. 0 205 22

Even 0 205 23
if 0 205 23
he 0 205 23
wasn’t 0 205 23
on 0 205 23
the 0 205 23
phone 0 205 23
to 0 205 23
Baghdadi, 0 205 23
the 0 205 23
likelihood 0 205 23
is 0 205 23
that 0 205 23
when 0 205 23
a 0 205 23
Muslim 0 205 23
drives 0 205 23
into 0 205 23
a 0 205 23
U.S. 0 205 23
Air 0 205 23
Force 0 205 23
Base 0 205 23
with 0 205 23
a 0 205 23
car 0 205 23
full 0 205 23
of 0 205 23
incendiaries, 0 205 23
probably 0 205 23
this 0 205 23
has 0 205 23
something 0 205 23
to 0 205 23
do 0 205 23
with 0 205 23
the 0 205 23
global 0 205 23
jihad. 0 205 23

The 1 205 24
FBI’s 1 205 24
bafflement 1 205 24
here 1 205 24
is 1 205 24
part 1 205 24
of 1 205 24
its 1 205 24
deep, 1 205 24
deep 1 205 24
corruption. 1 205 24

The 1 205 25
FBI 1 205 25
doesn’t 1 205 25
acknowledge 1 205 25
that 1 205 25
there 1 205 25
is 1 205 25
a 1 205 25
global 1 205 25
jihad, 1 205 25
or 1 205 25
that 1 205 25
Islam 1 205 25
has 1 205 25
anything 1 205 25
to 1 205 25
do 1 205 25
with 1 205 25
terrorism. 1 205 25

It 1 205 26
doesn’t 1 205 26
admit 1 205 26
that 1 205 26
there 1 205 26
is 1 205 26
a 1 205 26
war 1 205 26
going 1 205 26
on, 1 205 26
and 1 205 26
treats 1 205 26
each 1 205 26
act 1 205 26
of 1 205 26
Islamic 1 205 26
terror 1 205 26
as 1 205 26
if 1 205 26
it 1 205 26
were 1 205 26
a 1 205 26
separate 1 205 26
and 1 205 26
discrete 1 205 26
criminal 1 205 26
event, 1 205 26
unrelated 1 205 26
to 1 205 26
all 1 205 26
the 1 205 26
others. 1 205 26

So 1 205 27
each 1 205 27
time 1 205 27
something 1 205 27
like 1 205 27
this 1 205 27
happens, 1 205 27
they’re 1 205 27
back 1 205 27
at 1 205 27
Square 1 205 27
One, 1 205 27
trying 1 205 27
to 1 205 27
figure 1 205 27
out 1 205 27
motive. 1 205 27

It’s 0 205 28
as 0 205 28
if 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
U.S. 0 205 28
Army 0 205 28
stopped 0 205 28
to 0 205 28
interrogate 0 205 28
every 0 205 28
German 0 205 28
soldier 0 205 28
who 0 205 28
crashed 0 205 28
through 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
Ardennes 0 205 28
Forest 0 205 28
at 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
beginning 0 205 28
of 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
Battle 0 205 28
of 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
Bulge 0 205 28
in 0 205 28
1944, 0 205 28
to 0 205 28
see 0 205 28
if 0 205 28
each 0 205 28
one’s 0 205 28
actions 0 205 28
had 0 205 28
anything 0 205 28
to 0 205 28
do 0 205 28
with 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
German 1 205 28
Army 1 205 28
and 1 205 28
Adolf 1 205 28
Hitler’s 1 205 28
war 0 205 28
aims. 0 205 28

Authorities 0 205 29
are 0 205 29
also 0 205 29
investigating 0 205 29
whether 0 205 29
or 0 205 29
not 0 205 29
Kazi 0 205 29
was 0 205 29
suffering 0 205 29
from 0 205 29
any 0 205 29
mental 0 205 29
health 0 205 29
issues. 0 205 29

Here 0 205 30
again, 0 205 30
this 0 205 30
is 0 205 30
just 0 205 30
more 0 205 30
of 0 205 30
the 0 205 30
general 0 205 30
refusal 0 205 30
to 0 205 30

the 1 205 30
800-pound 1 205 30

in 0 205 30
the 0 205 30

room 0 205 30
and 0 205 30
screaming 1 205 30
“Allahu 1 205 30
akbar.” 1 205 30
Sean 0 205 30
Ragan 0 205 30
might 0 205 30
explain 0 205 30
to 0 205 30
us 0 205 30
that 0 205 30
authorities 0 205 30
are 0 205 30
also 0 205 30
trying 0 205 30
to 0 205 30
determine 0 205 30
whether 0 205 30
the 0 205 30
German 1 205 30
invasion 1 205 30
of 1 205 30
Poland 1 205 30
in 1 205 30
September 1 205 30
1939 1 205 30
was 1 205 30
motivated 1 205 30
by 1 205 30
Nazism, 1 205 30
or 0 205 30
by 0 205 30
mental 0 205 30
health 0 205 30
issues 0 205 30
among 0 205 30
the 0 205 30
German 0 205 30
High 0 205 30
Command. 0 205 30

This 0 205 31
willful 0 205 31
ignorance 0 205 31
leads 0 205 31
to 0 205 31
a 0 205 31
diversion 0 205 31
and 0 205 31
waste 0 205 31
of 0 205 31
resources 0 205 31
that 0 205 31
is 0 205 31
astronomical 1 205 31
and 1 205 31
catastrophic. 1 205 31

How 0 205 32
long 0 205 32
is 0 205 32
this 0 205 32
comic 0 205 32
opera 0 205 32
going 0 205 32
to 0 205 32
continue? 0 205 32

If 0 205 33
the 0 205 33
jihadis 0 205 33
advance 0 205 33
even 0 205 33
into 0 205 33

At 0 71 37
that 0 71 37

After 0 71 46

Hadeed 0 71 46
told 0 71 46
reporters 0 71 46
Bacon 0 71 46
had 0 71 46

to 0 71 46

“You 1 71 53

you? 1 71 53

You’re 0 71 54

talking 1 71 54

he 0 71 54
said 0 71 54
of 0 71 54
Gilani. 0 71 54

Hadeed 0 71 55
said 0 71 55
three 0 71 55
different 0 71 55
signatures 0 71 55
from 0 71 55
Abid 0 71 55
on 0 71 55
financial 0 71 55
documents 0 71 55
did 0 71 55
not 0 71 55
match, 0 71 55
and 0 71 55
put 0 71 55
a 0 71 55
defiant 0 71 55
Abid 0 71 55
on 0 71 55
the 0 71 55
witness 0 71 55
stand. 0 71 55

Hadeed: 0 71 56
Why 1 71 56
do 1 71 56
your 1 71 56
signatures 1 71 56
look 1 71 56
different? 1 71 56

Abid: 0 71 57
My 0 71 57
signatures 0 71 57
are 0 71 57
not 0 71 57
very 0 71 57
consistent, 0 71 57
I’m 1 71 57
just 1 71 57
a 1 71 57
human 1 71 57
being… 1 71 57

Hadeed: 0 71 58
You 0 71 58
were 0 71 58
aware 0 71 58
you 0 71 58
were 0 71 58
changing 0 71 58
beneficiary 0 71 58
from 0 71 58
your 0 71 58
father’s 0 71 58
spouse 0 71 58

yourself? 0 71 58

Abid: 0 71 59
That 0 71 59
was 0 71 59
my 0 71 59
father’s 0 71 59
request… 0 71 59

Hadeed: 0 71 60
You’re 0 71 60
not 0 71 60
answering 0 71 60
the 0 71 60
question. 0 71 60

Abid: 0 71 61
I’m 0 71 61
not 0 71 61
very 0 71 61
smart, 0 71 61
so 0 71 61
it 0 71 61
takes 0 71 61
a 0 71 61
while 0 71 61
sometimes… 0 71 61

Judge: 0 71 62
I 1 71 62
don’t 1 71 62
understand 1 71 62
why 1 71 62
the 1 71 62
witness 1 71 62
is 1 71 62
having 1 71 62
such 1 71 62
trouble 1 71 62
with 1 71 62
the 1 71 62
question. 1 71 62

Your 0 71 63
job 0 71 63
is 0 71 63
to 0 71 63
answer 0 71 63
the 0 71 63
question. 0 71 63

In 0 71 64
court 0 71 64
documents, 0 71 64
Gilani 0 71 64
alleged, 0 71 64
“while 0 71 64
he 0 71 64
was 0 71 64

some 0 71 64
other 0 71 64

also 0 71 64
installed/planted 0 71 64

my 0 71 64
house 0 71 64
… 0 71 64
Imran 0 71 64
Awan 0 71 64
showed 0 71 64
up 0 71 64
and 0 71 64
threatened 0 71 64
me 0 71 64
for 0 71 64
me 0 71 64
calling 0 71 64
the 0 71 64
police. 0 71 64

[Imran] 0 71 65
threatened 1 71 65
that 1 71 65
he 1 71 65
is 1 71 65

powerful 1 71 65
and 0 71 65
if 1 71 65
I 1 71 65
ever 1 71 65
call 1 71 65
the 1 71 65
police 1 71 65
again 1 71 65
[he] 1 71 65
will 1 71 65
do 1 71 65
harm 1 71 65
to 1 71 65
me.” 1 71 65
She 0 71 65
said 0 71 65
that 0 71 65
Imran 0 71 65
eventually 0 71 65
agreed 0 71 65
to 0 71 65
remove 0 71 65
the 0 71 65
listening 0 71 65
devices 0 71 65
and 0 71 65
did 0 71 65
so 0 71 65
in 0 71 65
front 0 71 65
of 0 71 65
her. 0 71 65

Based 0 71 66
on 0 71 66
Hadeed’s 0 71 66
narrow 0 71 66
legal 0 71 66
argument 0 71 66
about 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
life 0 71 66
insurance 0 71 66
contract’s 0 71 66
language, 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
judge 0 71 66
ruled 0 71 66
that, 0 71 66
“The 0 71 66
son 0 71 66
as 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
owner 0 71 66
of 0 71 66

the 0 71 66
absolute 0 71 66
right 0 71 66
to 0 71 66
change 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
beneficiary.” 0 71 66

After 0 71 67
Gilani 0 71 67
retained 0 71 67
a 0 71 67
lawyer, 0 71 67
Bacon 0 71 67
had 0 71 67
offered 0 71 67
a 0 71 67
settlement 0 71 67
where 0 71 67
they’d 0 71 67
split 0 71 67
the 0 71 67
money, 0 71 67
but 0 71 67
Gilani 0 71 67
declined 0 71 67
it. 0 71 67

The 0 71 68
court 0 71 68
awarded 0 71 68
Abid 0 71 68
the 0 71 68
$50,000 0 71 68
life 0 71 68
insurance 0 71 68
payout, 0 71 68
minus 0 71 68
$5,000 0 71 68
that 0 71 68
the 0 71 68
insurance 0 71 68
company 0 71 68
took 0 71 68
for 0 71 68
its 0 71 68
expenses 0 71 68
in 0 71 68
litigating 0 71 68
the 0 71 68
fraud 0 71 68
allegations. 0 71 68

“You 0 71 69
should 0 71 69
have 0 71 69
taken 0 71 69
the 0 71 69
settlement. 0 71 69

Now 0 71 70
she’s 0 71 70
not 0 71 70
getting 0 71 70
a 0 71 70
penny,” 0 71 70
Bacon 0 71 70
said 0 71 70
in 0 71 70
court. 0 71 70

“You’re 0 71 71
not 0 71 71
getting 0 71 71
anything.” 0 71 71

Gilani 0 71 72
said 0 71 72
after 0 71 72
court 0 71 72
that 0 71 72
her 0 71 72
conscience 0 71 72
didn’t 0 71 72
allow 0 71 72
her 0 71 72
to 0 71 72
settle. 0 71 72

“I 0 71 73
didn’t 0 71 73
do 0 71 73
the 0 71 73
deal 0 71 73
because 0 71 73
they 0 71 73

I 0 71 74
cannot 0 71 74
agree 0 71 74
to 0 71 74
that. 0 71 74

It 0 71 75
wasn’t 0 71 75
about 0 71 75

just 0 214 22
so 0 214 22
happens 0 214 22
that 0 214 22
at 0 214 22
least 0 214 22
one 0 214 22
of 0 214 22
these 0 214 22
calls 0 214 22
for 0 214 22
regime 0 214 22

in 0 214 22
Iran 0 214 22
was 0 214 22
caught 0 214 22
on 0 214 22
video 0 214 22
last 0 214 22
year 0 214 22
as 0 214 22
Bolton 0 214 22
gave 0 214 22
a 0 214 22
speech 0 214 22
at 0 214 22

“There 0 214 23
is 0 214 23
a 0 214 23
viable 0 214 23
opposition 0 214 23
to 0 214 23
the 0 214 23
rule 0 214 23
of 0 214 23
the 0 214 23
ayatollahs, 0 214 23
and 0 214 23
that 0 214 23
opposition 0 214 23
is 0 214 23
centered 0 214 23
in 0 214 23
this 0 214 23
room 0 214 23
today. 0 214 23

I 0 214 24
had 0 214 24
said 0 214 24
for 0 214 24
over 0 214 24
10 0 214 24
years 0 214 24
since 0 214 24
coming 0 214 24
to 0 214 24
these 0 214 24
events, 0 214 24
that 0 214 24
the 0 214 24
declared 0 214 24
policy 0 214 24
of 0 214 24
the 0 214 24
United 0 214 24
States 0 214 24
of 0 214 24
America 0 214 24
should 0 214 24
be 0 214 24
the 0 214 24
overthrow 0 214 24
of 0 214 24
the 0 214 24
mullahs’ 0 214 24
regime 0 214 24
in 0 214 24
Tehran. 0 214 24

The 0 214 25
behavior 0 214 25
and 0 214 25
the 0 214 25
objectives 0 214 25
of 0 214 25
the 0 214 25
regime 0 214 25
are 0 214 25
not 0 214 25
going 0 214 25
to 0 214 25
change, 0 214 25
and 0 214 25
therefore 0 214 25
the 0 214 25
only 0 214 25
solution 0 214 25
is 0 214 25
to 0 214 25
change 0 214 25
the 0 214 25
regime 0 214 25
itself. 0 214 25

And 0 214 26
that’s 0 214 26
why, 0 214 26
before 0 214 26
2019, 0 214 26
we 0 214 26
here 0 214 26
will 0 214 26
celebrate 0 214 26
in 0 214 26
Tehran!” 0 214 26

Pay 0 214 27
attention 0 214 27
to 0 214 27
the 0 214 27
first 0 214 27
line 0 214 27
in 0 214 27
that 0 214 27
quote 0 214 27
above 0 214 27
in 0 214 27
which 0 214 27
Bolton 0 214 27
notes 0 214 27
that 0 214 27
the 0 214 27
opposition 0 214 27
needed 0 214 27
to 0 214 27
overthrow 0 214 27
Iran’s 0 214 27

Who 1 214 27
was 1 214 27
in 1 214 27
that 1 214 27
room? 1 214 27

Well, 0 214 28
the 0 214 28
entire 0 214 28
event 0 214 28
was 0 214 28
actually 0 214 28
put 0 214 28
on 0 214 28
by 0 214 28
the 0 214 28
People’s 0 214 28
Mojahedin 0 214 28
Organization 0 214 28
of 0 214 28
Iran, 0 214 28
also 0 214 28
known 0 214 28
as 0 214 28
the 0 214 28
Mojahedin-e 0 214 28
Khalq 0 214 28
or 0 214 28
MEK. 0 214 28

As 0 214 29
Politico 0 214 29
pointed 0 214 29
out 0 214 29
in 0 214 29
a 0 214 29
2016 0 214 29
article, 0 214 29
despite 0 214 29
the 0 214 29
neocon 0 214 29
attempts 0 214 29
to 0 214 29
rewrite 0 214 29
history, 0 214 29
MEK 0 214 29
have 0 214 29
killed 0 214 29
Americans 0 214 29
and 0 214 29
committed 0 214 29
multiple 0 214 29
acts 0 214 29
of 0 214 29
terrorism. 0 214 29

For 0 214 30
decades, 0 214 30
and 0 214 30
based 0 214 30
on 0 214 30
U.S. 0 214 30
intelligence, 0 214 30
the 0 214 30
United 0 214 30
States 0 214 30
government 0 214 30
has 0 214 30
blamed 0 214 30
the 0 214 30
MEK 0 214 30
for 0 214 30
killing 0 214 30
three 0 214 30
U.S. 0 214 30
Army 0 214 30
colonels 0 214 30
and 0 214 30
three 0 214 30
U.S. 0 214 30
contractors, 0 214 30
bombing 0 214 30
the 0 214 30

of 0 214 30
numerous 0 214 30

and 0 214 30
killing 0 214 30
innocent 0 214 30
Iranians. 0 214 30

To 0 214 31
recap, 0 214 31
the 0 214 31
formerly 0 214 31
terrorist-classified 0 214 31
organization 0 214 31
MEK, 0 214 31
trained 0 214 31
in 0 214 31
the 0 214 31
US 0 214 31

then-Secretary 0 214 31

State 0 214 31
Hillary 0 214 31
Clinton 0 214 31
in 0 214 31
2012—which 0 214 31
has 0 214 31
since 0 214 31
been 0 214 31
heavily 0 214 31
funded 0 214 31
to 0 214 31
refine 0 214 31
their 0 214 31
image 0 214 31

for 0 214 31
“regime 0 214 31
change” 0 214 31
on 0 214 31
their 0 214 31
behalf—is 0 214 31
now 0 214 31
the 0 214 31
darling 1 214 31
child 1 214 31
of 0 214 31
the 0 214 31
neocon 0 214 31
agenda 0 214 31
and 0 214 31
the 0 214 31
impetus 0 214 31
behind 0 214 31
what 0 214 31

kick 0 214 31
of 0 214 31

While 0 214 32
the 0 214 32
current 0 214 32
Iranian 0 214 32
regime 0 214 32
is 0 214 32
certainly 0 214 32
no 0 214 32
bastion 0 214 32
of 0 214 32
freedom, 0 214 32
the 0 214 32
idea 0 214 32
that 0 214 32
US 0 214 32
intervention 0 214 32
or 0 214 32
a 0 214 32
violent 0 214 32
revolution 0 214 32
would 0 214 32
be 0 214 32
beneficial 0 214 32
for 0 214 32
the 0 214 32
people 0 214 32
of 0 214 32
Iran 0 214 32
or 0 214 32
American 0 214 32
citizens 0 214 32
is 0 214 32
outright 1 214 32
insane. 1 214 32

To 0 214 33
see 0 214 33
what 0 214 33
US 0 214 33
intervention—through 0 214 33
military 0 214 33
support 0 214 33
and 0 214 33
the 0 214 33
support 0 214 33
of 0 214 33
opposition 0 214 33
groups—does 0 214 33
to 0 214 33
countries, 0 214 33
one 0 214 33
need 0 214 33
only 0 214 33
look 0 214 33
at 0 214 33
Syria, 0 214 33
Iraq, 0 214 33
Afghanistan, 0 214 33
and 0 214 33
Libya 0 214 33
to 0 214 33
see 0 214 33
the 0 214 33
horrific 1 214 33
death 0 214 33
tolls 0 214 33
and 0 214 33
war-ravaged 1 214 33
dystopias 1 214 33
left 0 214 33
in 0 214 33
America’s 0 214 33
wake. 0 214 33

To 0 214 34
those 0 214 34
paying 0 214 34
attention 0 214 34
over 0 214 34
the 0 214 34
years, 0 214 34
Trump’s 0 214 34
desire 0 214 34
to 0 214 34
intervene 0 214 34
in 0 214 34
Iran, 0 214 34
and 0 214 34
his 0 214 34
subsequent 0 214 34
support 0 214 34
in 0 214 34
the 0 214 34
media 0 214 34
and 0 214 34
from 0 214 34
all 0 214 34
sides 0 214 34
of 0 214 34
the 0 214 34
political 0 214 34
spectrum 0 214 34
should 0 214 34
come 0 214 34
as 0 214 34
no 0 214 34
surprise 0 214 34
as 0 214 34
it 0 214 34
has 0 214 34
been 0 214 34
the 0 214 34
plan 0 214 34
since 0 214 34
Bill 0 214 34
Clinton 0 214 34
was 0 214 34
in 0 214 34
office 0 214 34
and 0 214 34
was 0 214 34
documented 0 214 34
in 0 214 34
the 0 214 34
neoconservative 0 214 34
PNAC 0 214 34
report. 0 214 34

This 0 214 35
was 0 214 35
even 0 214 35
admitted 0 214 35
by 0 214 35
General 0 214 35
Wesley 0 214 35
Clark, 0 214 35
former 0 214 35
Supreme 0 214 35
Allied 0 214 35
Commander 0 214 35
of 0 214 35
NATO, 0 214 35
that 0 214 35
the 0 214 35
U.S. 0 214 35
planned 0 214 35
on 0 214 35
going 0 214 35
to 0 214 35
war 0 214 35
with 0 214 35
Iran, 0 214 35
according 0 214 35
to 0 214 35
a 0 214 35
2001 0 214 35
memo 0 214 35
from 0 214 35
the 0 214 35
U.S. 0 214 35
Secretary 0 214 35
of 0 214 35
Defense. 0 214 35

“This 0 214 36
is 0 214 36
a 0 214 36
memo 0 214 36
that 0 214 36
describes 0 214 36
how 0 214 36
we’re 0 214 36
going 0 214 36
to 0 214 36
take 0 214 36
out 0 214 36
seven 0 214 36
countries 0 214 36
in 0 214 36
five 0 214 36
years,” 0 214 36
Clark 0 214 36
said. 0 214 36

“Starting 0 214 37
with 0 214 37
Iraq, 0 214 37
and 0 214 37
then 0 214 37
Syria, 0 214 37
Lebanon, 0 214 37
Libya, 0 214 37
Somalia, 0 214 37
Sudan, 0 214 37
and 0 214 37
finishing 0 214 37
off 0 214 37
with 0 214 37
Iran.” 0 214 37

All 0 214 38
presidents 0 214 38
since 0 214 38
Clinton 0 214 38
have 0 214 38
crossed 0 214 38
countries 0 214 38
off 0 214 38
this 0 214 38
list. 0 214 38

Now 0 214 39
it’s 0 214 39

you 1 215 1
were 1 215 1
not 1 215 1

Don't 0 215 3
get 0 215 3
me 0 215 3

here. 0 215 3

I'm 0 215 4
not 0 215 4
for 0 215 4
the 0 215 4
government 0 215 4
of 0 215 4
Iran. 0 215 4

I 0 215 5
despise 1 215 5
Islam 0 215 5

I 0 215 5
despise 1 215 5

Muhammad 0 215 5
and 0 215 5
his 0 215 5

Overall, 0 215 6
the 0 215 6
people 0 215 6
of 0 215 6
Iran 0 215 6
are 0 215 6
probably 0 215 6
some 0 215 6
decent 0 215 6
people, 0 215 6
but 0 215 6
those 0 215 6
in 0 215 6
leadership 0 215 6
have 0 215 6
issues, 0 215 6
but 0 215 6
that 0 215 6
is 0 215 6
something 0 215 6
for 0 215 6
the 0 215 6
people 0 215 6
there 0 215 6
to 0 215 6
deal 0 215 6
with. 0 215 6

Iran 0 215 7
is 0 215 7
not 0 215 7
an 0 215 7

Ah, 0 215 24

While 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
applaud 0 215 25

for 0 215 25

just 0 215 25
that, 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
am 0 215 25
not 0 215 25
so 0 215 25
naive 0 215 25
as 0 215 25
to 0 215 25
consider 0 215 25
that 0 215 25
his 0 215 25

the 0 215 25

no 0 215 25
effect 0 215 25
in 0 215 25
this 0 215 25
decision. 0 215 25

"The 0 215 26
ordinary 0 215 26

of 0 215 26

are 0 215 26

the 0 215 26

command," 0 215 26
SSG 0 215 26
writes 0 215 26
in 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
paper. 0 215 26

"This 0 215 27
has 0 215 27
provoked 0 215 27
noteworthy 0 215 27
protests 0 215 27
across 0 215 27
the 0 215 27
country 0 215 27
in 0 215 27
recent 0 215 27
months." 0 215 27

Well, 0 215 28
why 0 215 28
is 0 215 28
that? 0 215 28

It's 0 215 29
due 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
sanctions 0 215 29
imposed 0 215 29
by 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
likes 0 215 29
of 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
US. 0 215 29

As 0 215 30
has 0 215 30
been 0 215 30
pointed 0 215 30
out 0 215 30
before, 0 215 30
sanctions 0 215 30
hurt 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
people, 0 215 30
not 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
governments 0 215 30
that 0 215 30
lead 0 215 30
them 0 215 30
and 0 215 30
then 0 215 30
those 0 215 30
same 0 215 30
governments 0 215 30
use 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
effects 0 215 30
to 0 215 30
propagandize 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
people 0 215 30
against 0 215 30
those 0 215 30
who 0 215 30
are 0 215 30
ordering 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
sanctions. 0 215 30

I'm 0 215 31
not 0 215 31
saying 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
Iranian 0 215 31
government 0 215 31
is 0 215 31
good, 0 215 31
but 0 215 31
it 0 215 31
is 0 215 31
Iran's 0 215 31
government. 0 215 31

Honestly, 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
see 0 215 32
a 0 215 32
ton 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
corruption 0 215 32
and 0 215 32
warmongering 0 215 32
in 0 215 32
our 0 215 32
own 0 215 32
government 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
rivals 0 215 32
some 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
governments 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
America 0 215 32
stands 0 215 32
against. 0 215 32

Still, 0 215 33
as 0 215 33
was 0 215 33
pointed 0 215 33
out 0 215 33
by 0 215 33
Matt 0 215 33
Agorist, 0 215 33
Bolton 0 215 33
told 0 215 33
an 0 215 33
audience 0 215 33
of 0 215 33
the 0 215 33
Grand 0 215 33
Gathering 0 215 33
of 0 215 33
Iranians 0 215 33
for 0 215 33
Free 0 215 33
Iran: 0 215 33

“There 0 215 34
is 0 215 34
a 0 215 34
viable 0 215 34
opposition 0 215 34
to 0 215 34
the 0 215 34
rule 0 215 34
of 0 215 34
the 0 215 34
ayatollahs, 0 215 34
and 0 215 34
that 0 215 34
opposition 0 215 34
is 0 215 34
centered 0 215 34
in 0 215 34
this 0 215 34
room 0 215 34
today. 0 215 34

I 0 215 35
had 0 215 35
said 0 215 35
for 0 215 35
over 0 215 35
10 0 215 35
years 0 215 35
since 0 215 35
coming 0 215 35
to 0 215 35
these 0 215 35
events, 0 215 35
that 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
declared 0 215 35
policy 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
United 0 215 35
States 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
America 0 215 35
should 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
overthrow 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
mullahs’ 0 215 35
regime 0 215 35
in 0 215 35
Tehran. 0 215 35

The 0 215 36
behavior 0 215 36
and 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
objectives 0 215 36
of 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
regime 0 215 36
are 0 215 36
not 0 215 36
going 0 215 36
to 0 215 36
change, 0 215 36
and 0 215 36
therefore 0 215 36
the 1 215 36
only 1 215 36
solution 1 215 36
is 0 215 36
to 0 215 36
change 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
regime 0 215 36
itself. 0 215 36

And 0 215 37
that’s 0 215 37
why, 0 215 37
before 0 215 37
2019, 0 215 37
we 0 215 37
here 0 215 37
will 0 215 37
celebrate 0 215 37
in 0 215 37
Tehran!” 0 215 37

And 0 215 38
again, 0 215 38
this 0 215 38
really 0 215 38
has 0 215 38
nothing 0 215 38
to 0 215 38
do 0 215 38

“Prior 0 215 41

knows 0 215 44
that 0 215 44

that 0 215 44

that 0 215 44
“nothing’s 0 215 44
off 0 215 44

OK, 0 215 45
I 0 215 45
get 0 215 45
they 0 215 45
may 0 215 45
pose 0 215 45
a 0 215 45
danger, 0 215 45
but 0 215 45
let's 0 215 45
look 0 215 45
at 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
reality 0 215 45
here. 0 215 45

Those 0 215 46
they 0 215 46
pose 0 215 46
a 0 215 46
danger 0 215 46
to, 0 215 46
namely 0 215 46
Saudi 0 215 46
Arabia 0 215 46
and 0 215 46
Israel 0 215 46
can 0 215 46
both 0 215 46
fend 0 215 46
perfectly 0 215 46
well 0 215 46
for 0 215 46
themselves 0 215 46
and 0 215 46
have 0 215 46
demonstrated 0 215 46
that 0 215 46
ability 0 215 46
to 0 215 46
do 0 215 46
it. 0 215 46

There 0 215 47
is 0 215 47
no 0 215 47
need 0 215 47
for 0 215 47
the 0 215 47
US 0 215 47
to 0 215 47
be 0 215 47
involved 0 215 47
in 0 215 47
it 0 215 47
in 0 215 47
any 0 215 47
way. 0 215 47

Why 0 215 48
should 0 215 48
we 0 215 48
be 0 215 48
fighting 0 215 48
a 0 215 48
battle 0 215 48
or 0 215 48
encouraging, 0 215 48
funding, 0 215 48
and 0 215 48
I'm 0 215 48
quite 0 215 48
sure 0 215 48
arming, 0 215 48
a 0 215 48
rebellion? 0 215 48

Where 0 215 49
is 0 215 49
that 0 215 49
authorized 0 215 49
in 0 215 49
our 1 215 49
Constitution? 1 215 49

Simple. 0 215 50

It 0 215 51
isn't. 0 215 51

I 0 215 52
care 0 215 52
little 0 215 52
for 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
Saudi 0 215 52
government 0 215 52
as 0 215 52
they 0 215 52
help 0 215 52
push 0 215 52
Sharia 0 215 52
and 0 215 52
is 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
land 0 215 52
where 0 215 52
many 0 215 52
of 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
9-11 0 215 52
hijackers 0 215 52
came 0 215 52
from. 0 215 52

The 0 215 53
Iranian 0 215 53
government 0 215 53
I 0 215 53
care 0 215 53
for 0 215 53
even 0 215 53
less, 0 215 53
but 0 215 53
out 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
each 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
those, 0 215 53
which 0 215 53
one 0 215 53
should 0 215 53
America 0 215 53
have 0 215 53
dealt 0 215 53
with 0 215 53
militarily 0 215 53
following 0 215 53
9-11? 0 215 53

Both, 0 215 54
if 0 215 54
you're 0 215 54
going 0 215 54
to 0 215 54
go 0 215 54
by 0 215 54
information 0 215 54
that 0 215 54
we 0 215 54
have 0 215 54
a 0 215 54
record 0 215 54
on. 0 215 54

Why 0 215 55
can't 0 215 55
America 0 215 55
focus 0 215 55
on 0 215 55
it's 0 215 55
own 0 215 55
issues 0 215 55
and 0 215 55
solve 0 215 55
those? 0 215 55

It's 0 215 56
because 0 215 56
we 0 215 56
are 0 215 56
too 0 215 56
busy 0 215 56
trying 0 215 56
to 0 215 56
police 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
world, 0 215 56
keeping 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
spotlight 0 215 56
off 0 215 56
of 0 215 56
those 0 215 56
in 0 215 56
our 0 215 56
government 0 215 56
who 0 215 56
are 0 215 56
attacking 0 215 56
our 0 215 56
rights 0 215 56
and 0 215 56
spending 0 215 56
us 0 215 56
into 0 215 56
more 0 215 56
and 0 215 56
more 0 215 56
debt. 0 215 56

And 0 215 57
lest 0 215 57
you 0 215 57
think 0 215 57
this 0 215 57
is 0 215 57
about 0 215 57
the 0 215 57
nuclear 0 215 57
deal. 0 215 57

It 0 215 58
isn't. 0 215 58

“The 0 215 59

don't 1 215 64

countries 0 215 76
where 0 215 76
the 0 215 76
people 0 215 76
want 0 215 76
their 0 215 76
independence. 0 215 76

Remember 0 215 77
the 0 215 77
Kurds? 0 215 77

How 0 215 78
about 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
people 0 215 78
in 0 215 78
the 0 215 78
Catalan 0 215 78
region 0 215 78
of 0 215 78
Spain? 0 215 78

No 0 215 79
support 0 215 79
for 0 215 79
those 0 215 79
people, 0 215 79
and 0 215 79
why? 0 215 79

Cause 0 215 80
it's 0 215 80
not 0 215 80
part 0 215 80
of 0 215 80
the 0 215 80
agenda. 0 215 80

I 0 215 81
say 0 215 81
if 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
Iranian 0 215 81
people 0 215 81
want 0 215 81
their 0 215 81
freedom, 0 215 81
let 0 215 81
them 0 215 81
first 0 215 81
free 0 215 81
themselves 0 215 81
from 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
bondage 0 215 81
of 0 215 81
Islam, 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
then 0 215 81
let 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
passion 0 215 81
that 0 215 81
burns 0 215 81
inside 0 215 81
men 0 215 81
to 0 215 81
be 0 215 81
free 0 215 81
rise 0 215 81
up 0 215 81
as 0 215 81
it 0 215 81
did 0 215 81
in 0 215 81
our 0 215 81
forefathers 0 215 81
due 0 215 81
to 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
teachings 0 215 81
fo 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
Holy 0 215 81
Scriptures 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
stand 0 215 81
and 0 215 81
fight. 0 215 81

Then, 0 215 81

they 0 215 81

will 0 215 81

be 0 215 81

in 0 215 81

a 0 215 81

position 0 215 81

to 0 215 81

ask 0 215 81

for 0 215 81

aid, 0 215 81

but 0 215 81

only 0 215 81

Back 0 216 1
in 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
2008 0 216 1
presidential 0 216 1
race, 0 216 1
I 0 216 1
explained 0 216 1
to 0 216 1
then-candidate 0 216 1
Rudy 0 216 1
Giuliani 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
concept 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
“blowback.” 0 216 1
Years 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
US 0 216 1
meddling 0 216 1
and 0 216 1
military 0 216 1

parts 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
Middle 0 216 1

a 0 216 1
group 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
terrorists 0 216 1
to 0 216 1
carry 0 216 1
out 0 216 1
attacks 0 216 1
against 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
United 0 216 1
States 0 216 1
on 0 216 1
9/11. 0 216 1

They 0 216 2
didn’t 0 216 2
do 0 216 2
it 0 216 2
because 0 216 2
we 0 216 2
are 0 216 2
so 0 216 2
rich 0 216 2
and 0 216 2
so 0 216 2
free, 0 216 2
as 0 216 2
the 0 216 2
neocons 0 216 2
would 0 216 2
have 0 216 2
us 0 216 2
believe. 0 216 2

They 0 216 3
came 0 216 3
over 0 216 3
here 0 216 3
because 0 216 3
we 0 216 3
had 0 216 3
been 0 216 3
killing 0 216 3
Muslims 0 216 3
“over 0 216 3
there” 0 216 3
for 0 216 3
decades. 0 216 3

How 0 216 4
do 0 216 4
we 0 216 4
know 0 216 4
this? 0 216 4

Well, 0 216 5
they 0 216 5
told 0 216 5
us. 0 216 5

Osama 0 216 6
bin 0 216 6
Laden 0 216 6
made 0 216 6
it 0 216 6
clear 0 216 6
why 0 216 6
al-Qaeda 0 216 6
sought 0 216 6
to 0 216 6
attack 0 216 6
the 0 216 6
US. 0 216 6

They 0 216 7
didn’t 0 216 7
like 0 216 7
the 0 216 7
US 0 216 7
taking 0 216 7
sides 0 216 7
in 0 216 7
the 0 216 7
Israel-Palestine 0 216 7
conflict 0 216 7
and 0 216 7
they 0 216 7
didn’t 0 216 7
like 0 216 7
US 0 216 7
troops 0 216 7
on 0 216 7
their 0 216 7

Why 0 216 8
believe 0 216 8
a 0 216 8
terrorist, 0 216 8
some 0 216 8
responded. 0 216 8

As 0 216 9

Unfortunately, 0 216 20
it 0 216 20
is 0 216 20
clear 0 216 20
that 0 216 20
Giuliani 0 216 20
never 0 216 20
really 0 216 20
understood 0 216 20
what 0 216 20
I 0 216 20
was 0 216 20
trying 0 216 20
to 0 216 20
tell 0 216 20
him. 0 216 20

Like 0 216 21
the 0 216 21
rest 0 216 21
of 0 216 21
the 0 216 21
neocons, 0 216 21
he 0 216 21
either 0 216 21
doesn’t 0 216 21
get 0 216 21
it 0 216 21
or 0 216 21
doesn’t 0 216 21
want 0 216 21
to 0 216 21
get 0 216 21
it. 0 216 21

In 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
recent 0 216 22
speech 0 216 22
to 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
MeK 0 216 22
– 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
violent 1 216 22
Islamist-Marxist 0 216 22
cult 0 216 22
that 0 216 22
spent 0 216 22
two 0 216 22
decades 0 216 22
on 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
US 0 216 22
terror 0 216 22
watch 0 216 22
list 0 216 22
– 0 216 22
Giuliani 0 216 22
promised 0 216 22
that 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
Trump 0 216 22
Administration 0 216 22
had 0 216 22
made 0 216 22
“regime 0 216 22
change” 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
priority 0 216 22
for 0 216 22
Iran. 0 216 22

He 0 216 23
even 0 216 23
told 0 216 23
the 0 216 23
members 0 216 23
of 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
organization 0 216 23
– 0 216 23
an 0 216 23
organization 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
has 0 216 23
killed 1 216 23
dozens 1 216 23
of 1 216 23
Americans 1 216 23
– 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
Trump 0 216 23
would 0 216 23
put 0 216 23
them 0 216 23
in 0 216 23
charge 0 216 23
of 0 216 23
Iran! 0 216 23

Giuliani 0 216 24
shares 0 216 24
with 0 216 24
numerous 0 216 24
other 0 216 24
neocons 0 216 24
like 0 216 24
John 0 216 24
Bolton 0 216 24
a 0 216 24
strong 0 216 24
relationship 0 216 24
with 0 216 24
this 0 216 24
group. 0 216 24

In 0 216 25
fact, 0 216 25
both 0 216 25
Giuliani 0 216 25
and 0 216 25
Bolton 0 216 25
have 0 216 25
been 0 216 25
on 0 216 25
the 0 216 25
payroll 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
the 0 216 25
MeK 0 216 25
and 0 216 25
have 0 216 25
received 0 216 25
tens 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
thousands 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
dollars 0 216 25
to 0 216 25
speak 0 216 25
to 0 216 25
their 0 216 25
followers. 0 216 25

This 0 216 26
is 0 216 26
another 0 216 26
example 0 216 26
of 0 216 26
how 0 216 26
foreign 0 216 26
lobbies 0 216 26
and 0 216 26
special 0 216 26
interest 0 216 26
groups 0 216 26
maintain 0 216 26
an 0 216 26
iron 0 216 26
grip 0 216 26
on 0 216 26
our 0 216 26
foreign 0 216 26
policy. 0 216 26

Does 1 216 27
anyone 1 216 27
really 1 216 27
think 1 216 27
Iran 1 216 27
will 1 216 27
be 1 216 27
better 1 216 27
off 1 216 27
if 1 216 27
Trump 1 216 27
puts 1 216 27
a 1 216 27
bunch 1 216 27
of 1 216 27
“former” 1 216 27
terrorists 1 216 27
in 1 216 27
charge 1 216 27
of 1 216 27
the 1 216 27
country? 1 216 27

How 1 216 28
did 1 216 28
that 1 216 28
work 1 216 28
in 1 216 28
Libya? 1 216 28

It’s 0 216 29
easy 0 216 29
to 0 216 29
dismiss 0 216 29
the 0 216 29
bombastic 0 216 29
Giuliani 0 216 29
as 0 216 29
he 0 216 29
speaks 0 216 29
to 0 216 29
his 0 216 29
financial 0 216 29
benefactors 0 216 29
in 0 216 29
the 0 216 29
MeK. 0 216 29

Unfortunately, 0 216 30
however, 0 216 30
Giuliani’s 0 216 30
claims 0 216 30
were 0 216 30
confirmed 0 216 30
late 0 216 30
last 0 216 30
week, 0 216 30
when 0 216 30
the 0 216 30
Washington 0 216 30
Free 0 216 30
Beacon 0 216 30
published 0 216 30
a 0 216 30
three-page 0 216 30
policy 0 216 30
paper 0 216 30
being 0 216 30
circulated 0 216 30
among 0 216 30
National 0 216 30
Security 0 216 30
Council 0 216 30
officials 0 216 30
containing 0 216 30
plans 0 216 30
to 0 216 30
spark 0 216 30
regime 0 216 30
change 0 216 30
in 0 216 30
Iran. 0 216 30

The 0 216 31
paper 0 216 31
suggests 0 216 31
that 0 216 31
the 0 216 31
US 0 216 31
focus 0 216 31
on 0 216 31
Iran’s 0 216 31
many 0 216 31
ethnic 0 216 31
minority 0 216 31
groups 0 216 31
to 0 216 31
spark 0 216 31
unrest 0 216 31
and 0 216 31
an 0 216 31
eventual 0 216 31
overthrow 0 216 31
of 0 216 31
the 0 216 31
government. 0 216 31

This 0 216 32
is 0 216 32
virtually 0 216 32
the 0 216 32
same 0 216 32
road 0 216 32
map 0 216 32
that 0 216 32
the 0 216 32
US 0 216 32
has 0 216 32
followed 0 216 32
in 0 216 32
Iraq, 0 216 32
Libya, 0 216 32
Syria, 0 216 32
and 0 216 32
so 0 216 32
on. 0 216 32

The 0 216 33
results 0 216 33
have 0 216 33
been 0 216 33
unmitigated 0 216 33
disaster 1 216 33
after 1 216 33
disaster. 1 216 33

Unleashing 0 216 34
terrorists 0 216 34
on 0 216 34
Iran 0 216 34
to 0 216 34
overthrow 0 216 34
its 0 216 34
government 0 216 34
is 0 216 34
not 0 216 34
only 0 216 34
illegal 0 216 34
and 0 216 34
immoral: 0 216 34
it’s 0 216 34
also 0 216 34
incredibly 1 216 34
stupid. 1 216 34

We 0 216 35
know 0 216 35
from 0 216 35
9/11 0 216 35
that 0 216 35
blowback 0 216 35
is 0 216 35
real, 0 216 35
even 0 216 35
if 0 216 35
Giuliani 0 216 35
and 0 216 35
the 0 216 35
neocons 0 216 35

does 0 216 36
not 0 216 36
threaten 0 216 36
the 0 216 36
United 0 216 36

Unlike 0 216 37
Washington’s 0 216 37

not 0 216 38

it 0 216 39

Their 0 220 18
excuse 0 220 18
was 0 220 18
calligraphy. 0 220 18

I 0 220 19
was 0 220 19
like, 0 220 19
‘Whoa! 1 220 19

Whoa!’ 1 220 21
First 0 220 21

‘That 0 220 23

claiming: 0 220 25
“The 0 220 25

He 0 220 26
said 0 220 26
that 0 220 26
Christianity 0 220 26

Penkoski’s 0 220 27
daughter, 0 220 27
Brielle, 0 220 27
however, 0 220 27
said 0 220 27
that 0 220 27
the 0 220 27

Penkoski 0 220 28

out 0 220 28
that 0 220 28

extensive 0 220 28
for 0 220 28

than 0 220 28
they 0 220 28

“Notice 0 220 28

the 0 220 39
same 0 220 39
stuff 0 220 39
that 0 220 39
everyone 0 220 39
else 0 220 39
is 0 220 39
teaching.” 0 220 39

Indeed. 0 220 40

In 0 220 41
2015, 0 220 41
students 0 220 41
at 0 220 41
Spring 0 220 41
Hill 0 220 41
Middle 0 220 41
School 0 220 41
in 0 220 41
Spring 0 220 41
Hill, 0 220 41
Tennessee 0 220 41
were 0 220 41
forced 1 220 41
as 0 220 41
part 0 220 41
of 0 220 41
an 0 220 41
assignment 0 220 41
to 0 220 41
write, 0 220 41
“There 0 220 41
is 0 220 41
no 0 220 41
god 0 220 41
but 0 220 41
Allah; 0 220 41
Muhammad 0 220 41

his 0 220 41
prophet.” 0 220 41
Mother 0 220 41
Joy 0 220 41
Ellis 0 220 41
remarked: 0 220 41
“This 0 220 41
is 0 220 41
a 0 220 41
seventh 0 220 41
grade 0 220 41
state 0 220 41
standard, 0 220 41
and 0 220 41
will 0 220 41
be 0 220 41
on 0 220 41
the 0 220 41
TCAP. 0 220 41

I 0 220 42
didn’t 0 220 42
have 0 220 42
a 0 220 42
problem 0 220 42
with 0 220 42
the 0 220 42
history 0 220 42
of 0 220 42
Islam 0 220 42
being 0 220 42
taught, 0 220 42
but 0 220 42
to 0 220 42
go 0 220 42
so 0 220 42
far 0 220 42
as 0 220 42
to 0 220 42
make 0 220 42
my 0 220 42
child 0 220 42
write 0 220 42
the 0 220 42
Shahada, 0 220 42
is 0 220 42
unacceptable.” 1 220 42
Another 0 220 42
mother, 0 220 42
Brandee 0 220 42
Porterfield, 0 220 42
observed: 0 220 42
“It 0 220 42
really 0 220 42
did 0 220 42
bother 0 220 42
me 0 220 42
that 0 220 42
they 0 220 42
skipped 0 220 42
the 0 220 42
whole 0 220 42
chapter 0 220 42
on 0 220 42
the 0 220 42
rise 0 220 42
of 0 220 42
Christianity 0 220 42
and 0 220 42
they 0 220 42
spent 0 220 42
three 0 220 42
weeks 0 220 42
just 0 220 42
studying 0 220 42
Islam….I 0 220 42
spoke 0 220 42
with 0 220 42
the 0 220 42
teacher 0 220 42
and 0 220 42
the 0 220 42
principal,” 0 220 42
she 0 220 42
said. 0 220 42

“They 0 220 43
are 0 220 43
not 0 220 43
going 0 220 43
to 0 220 43
learn 0 220 43
any 0 220 43
other 0 220 43
religion, 0 220 43

they 0 220 43
are 0 220 43
not 0 220 43
going 0 220 43
back 0 220 43
over 0 220 43
this 0 220 43
chapter. 0 220 43

Even 0 220 44
though 0 220 44
they 0 220 44
discuss 0 220 44
Christianity 0 220 44
a 0 220 44
little 0 220 44
bit 0 220 44
during 0 220 44
the 0 220 44
Middle 0 220 44

they 0 220 44
are 0 220 44

Maury 0 220 45
County 0 220 45
Director 0 220 45
of 0 220 45
Schools, 0 220 45
Chris 0 220 45
Marczak, 0 220 45
defended 0 220 45
the 0 220 45
curriculum: 0 220 45
“It 0 220 45
is 0 220 45
our 0 220 45
job 0 220 45
as 0 220 45
a 0 220 45
public 0 220 45
school 0 220 45
system 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
educate 0 220 45
our 0 220 45
students 0 220 45
on 0 220 45
world 0 220 45
history 0 220 45
in 0 220 45
order 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
be 0 220 45
ready 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
compete 0 220 45
in 0 220 45
a 0 220 45
global 0 220 45
society, 0 220 45
not 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
endorse 0 220 45
one 0 220 45
religion 0 220 45
over 0 220 45
another 0 220 45
or 0 220 45
indoctrinate.” 1 220 45
Porterfield, 0 220 45
however, 0 220 45
shot 0 220 45
back: 0 220 45
“They 0 220 45
are 0 220 45
not 0 220 45
going 0 220 45
over 0 220 45
anything 0 220 45
else. 0 220 45

So 0 220 46
for 0 220 46
the 0 220 46
students 0 220 46
to 0 220 46
have 0 220 46
to 0 220 46
memorize 0 220 46
this 0 220 46
prayer, 0 220 46
it 0 220 46
does 0 220 46
seem 0 220 46
like 0 220 46
it 0 220 46
is 0 220 46
indoctrination.” 1 220 46

None 0 220 47
of 0 220 47
the 0 220 47
encroachments 0 220 47
of 0 220 47
Islam 0 220 47
in 0 220 47
public 0 220 47
schools 0 220 47
should 0 220 47
come 0 220 47
as 0 220 47
any 0 220 47
real 0 220 47
surprise. 0 220 47

Multiculturalism, 0 220 48
after 0 220 48
all, 0 220 48
amounts 0 220 48
to 0 220 48
respect 0 220 48
for 0 220 48
every 0 220 48
culture 0 220 48
except 0 220 48
one’s 0 220 48
own. 0 220 48

The 0 220 49
embarrassment, 0 220 49
regret, 0 220 49
and 0 220 49
even 0 220 49
self-hatred 0 220 49
that 0 220 49
has 0 220 49
been 0 220 49
inculcated 0 220 49
in 0 220 49
American 0 220 49
public 0 220 49
school 0 220 49
students 0 220 49
for 0 220 49
decades 0 220 49
now 0 220 49
has 0 220 49
created 0 220 49
a 0 220 49
vacuum, 0 220 49
which 0 220 49
Muslims 0 220 49
have 0 220 49
shown 0 220 49
themselves 0 220 49
to 0 220 49
be 0 220 49
all 0 220 49
too 0 220 49
eager 0 220 49
to 0 220 49
fill. 0 220 49

Certainly, 0 220 50
those 0 220 50
who 0 220 50
are 0 220 50
furthering 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
Islamization 0 220 50
of 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
schools 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
deny 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
they 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
like 0 220 50
to 0 220 50
see 0 220 50
Islamic 0 220 50
law 0 220 50
implemented 0 220 50
in 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
United 0 220 50
States, 0 220 50
and 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
indignantly 0 220 50
reject 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
claim 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
their 0 220 50
efforts 0 220 50
were 0 220 50
furthering 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
end 0 220 50
in 0 220 50
any 0 220 50
way. 0 220 50

They 0 220 51
would 0 220 51
say 0 220 51
that 0 220 51
they 0 220 51
are 0 220 51
doing 0 220 51
it 0 220 51
all 0 220 51
for 0 220 51
tolerance, 0 220 51
pluralism, 0 220 51
and 0 220 51
multiculturalism. 0 220 51

Unfortunately, 0 220 52
in 0 220 52
the 0 220 52
end, 0 220 52
it 0 220 52
amounts 0 220 52
to 0 220 52
the 0 220 52
same 0 220 52
thing. 0 220 52

2005-2006, 0 72 15
Bolton 0 72 15
served 0 72 15
as 0 72 15
the 0 72 15
Bush 0 72 15
administration’s 0 72 15
ambassador 0 72 15
to 0 72 15
the 0 72 15
UN. 0 72 15

He 0 72 16
established 0 72 16
a 0 72 16
tradition 0 72 16
for 0 72 16
the 0 72 16
post 0 72 16
of 0 72 16
being 0 72 16
anti-Muslim, 0 72 16
pro-Israel 0 72 16
and 0 72 16
anti-Russian, 0 72 16
a 0 72 16
policy 0 72 16
continued 0 72 16
to 0 72 16
this 0 72 16
day 0 72 16
by 0 72 16
the 0 72 16
current 0 72 16
US 0 72 16
UN 0 72 16
rep, 0 72 16
loud-mouthed 0 72 16
neocon 0 72 16
Nikki 0 72 16
Haley. 0 72 16

In 0 72 17
the 0 72 17
2005-2006 0 72 17
period, 0 72 17
after 0 72 17
years 0 72 17
of 0 72 17
negotiations, 0 72 17
the 0 72 17
US 0 72 17
and 0 72 17
North 0 72 17
Korea 0 72 17
were 0 72 17
close 0 72 17
to 0 72 17
a 0 72 17
nuclear/peace 0 72 17
deal. 0 72 17

Enter 0 72 18
John 0 72 18
Bolton. 0 72 18

He 0 72 19
succeeded 0 72 19
in 0 72 19
sabotaging 0 72 19
the 0 72 19
US-North 0 72 19
Korea 0 72 19
deal. 0 72 19

Why? 0 72 20

Because 0 72 21
Bolton, 0 72 21
as 0 72 21
an 0 72 21
arch 0 72 21
neocon, 0 72 21
was 0 72 21
fanatically 1 72 21
pro-Israel 0 72 21
and 0 72 21
feared 0 72 21
that 0 72 21
North 0 72 21
Korea 0 72 21
might 0 72 21
provide 0 72 21
nuclear 0 72 21
technology 0 72 21
to 0 72 21
Israel’s 0 72 21
foes. 0 72 21

As 0 72 22
usual 0 72 22
with 0 72 22
the 0 72 22
neocons, 0 72 22
Israel’s 0 72 22
interests 0 72 22
came 0 72 22
before 0 72 22
those 0 72 22
of 0 72 22
the 0 72 22
United 0 72 22
States. 0 72 22

Trump’s 0 72 23
newly 0 72 23
named 0 72 23
Secretary 0 72 23
of 0 72 23
State, 0 72 23
Michael 0 72 23
Pompeo, 0 72 23
is 0 72 23
also 0 72 23
an 0 72 23
ardent 0 72 23
neocon. 0 72 23

Last 0 72 24
week, 0 72 24
Bolton 0 72 24
went 0 72 24
onto 0 72 24
US 0 72 24
TV 0 72 24
and 0 72 24
actually 0 72 24
suggested 0 72 24
North 0 72 24
Korea 0 72 24
might 0 72 24
follow 0 72 24
the 0 72 24
course 0 72 24
set 0 72 24
by 0 72 24
Libya, 0 72 24
of 0 72 24
all 0 72 24
places. 0 72 24

Libya’s 0 72 25
then 0 72 25
ruler, 0 72 25
Muammar 0 72 25
Kadaffi, 0 72 25
bought 0 72 25
some 0 72 25
nuclear 0 72 25
equipment 0 72 25
from 0 72 25
Pakistan 0 72 25
so 0 72 25
he 0 72 25
could 0 72 25
hand 0 72 25
it 0 72 25
over 0 72 25
to 0 72 25
the 0 72 25
US 0 72 25
as 0 72 25
a 0 72 25
gesture 0 72 25
of 0 72 25
cooperation 0 72 25
after 0 72 25
the 0 72 25
Bush 0 72 25
administration 0 72 25
invaded 0 72 25
Iraq. 0 72 25

The 0 72 26
handover 0 72 26
was 0 72 26
done 0 72 26
with 0 72 26
much 1 72 26
fanfare, 1 72 26
then 0 72 26
the 0 72 26
US, 0 72 26
France 0 72 26
and 0 72 26
Britain 0 72 26
attacked 0 72 26
Libya 0 72 26
and 0 72 26
overthrew 0 72 26
Kadaffi. 0 72 26

The 0 72 27
hapless 1 72 27
Libyan 0 72 27
leader 0 72 27
was 0 72 27
eventually 0 72 27

Is 1 72 29
this 1 72 29
what 1 72 29
Bolton 1 72 29
has 1 72 29
in 1 72 29

for 1 72 29
North 1 72 29
Korea? 1 72 29

The 0 72 30
Northerners 0 72 30
certainly 0 72 30
seemed 0 72 30
to 0 72 30
think 0 72 30
so. 0 72 30

Some 0 72 31
wondered 0 72 31
if 0 72 31
Bolton 0 72 31
and 0 72 31
perhaps 0 72 31
Pompeo 0 72 31
were 0 72 31
trying 0 72 31

sabotage 0 72 31
the 0 72 31
North 0 72 31

Or 0 72 32
were 0 72 32
at 0 72 32
least 0 72 32
being 0 72 32
incredibly 1 72 32
obtuse 1 72 32
and 0 72 32
belligerent. 0 72 32

Was 1 72 33
Trump 1 72 33
involved 1 72 33
in 1 72 33
this 1 72 33
intrigue? 1 72 33

Hard 0 72 34
to 0 72 34
tell. 0 72 34

But 0 72 35
he 0 72 35
can’t 0 72 35
be 0 72 35
happy. 0 72 35

His 0 72 36
minions 1 72 36

rather 0 72 36
ahead 0 72 36
of 0 72 36

Or 0 72 37
was 0 72 37
the 0 72 37
US 0 72 37

rattling 0 72 37

Officials 0 221 17
are 0 221 17
working 0 221 17
urgently 0 221 17
to 0 221 17
prevent 0 221 17
the 0 221 17
disease 0 221 17
from 0 221 17
spreading 0 221 17
beyond 0 221 17
Mbandaka, 0 221 17
which 0 221 17
lies 0 221 17
on 0 221 17
the 0 221 17
Congo 0 221 17
River, 0 221 17
a 0 221 17
busy 0 221 17
traffic 0 221 17
corridor, 0 221 17
and 0 221 17
is 0 221 17
an 0 221 17
hour’s 0 221 17

The 0 221 18
spread 0 221 18
of 0 221 18
Ebola 0 221 18
from 0 221 18
a 0 221 18
rural 0 221 18
area 0 221 18
to 0 221 18
Mbandaka 0 221 18
has 0 221 18
raised 0 221 18
alarm 1 221 18
as 1 221 18
Ebola 1 221 18
can 1 221 18
spread 1 221 18
more 1 221 18
quickly 1 221 18
in 1 221 18
urban 1 221 18
centers. 1 221 18

The 0 221 19
fever 0 221 19
can 0 221 19
cause 0 221 19
severe 0 221 19
internal 0 221 19
bleeding 0 221 19
that 0 221 19
is 0 221 19
often 0 221 19
fatal. 0 221 19

Meaning, 0 221 20
the 0 221 20
virus 0 221 20
itself 0 221 20
doesn’t 0 221 20
actually 0 221 20
kill. 0 221 20

The 0 221 21
immune 0 221 21
system’s 0 221 21
response 0 221 21
to 0 221 21
the 0 221 21
virus 0 221 21
is 0 221 21
what’s 0 221 21
deadly. 0 221 21

ZMapp 0 221 22
is 0 221 22
also 0 221 22
an 0 221 22
experimental 0 221 22
drug 0 221 22
that 0 221 22
could 0 221 22
aid 0 221 22
in 0 221 22
the 0 221 22
recovery 0 221 22
from 0 221 22
the 0 221 22
Ebola 0 221 22
virus. 0 221 22

But, 0 221 23
like 0 221 23
the 0 221 23
vaccine 0 221 23
being 0 221 23
administered, 0 221 23
it 0 221 23
has 0 221 23
not 0 221 23
been 0 221 23
tested 0 221 23
for 0 221 23
safety 0 221 23
or 0 221 23
efficacy 0 221 23
yet. 0 221 23

It 0 221 24
is 0 221 24
not 0 221 24
a 0 221 24
vaccine 0 221 24
– 0 221 24
it 0 221 24
is 0 221 24
a 0 221 24
therapeutic 0 221 24
drug. 0 221 24

Of 0 221 25
the 0 221 25
seven 0 221 25
people 0 221 25
given 0 221 25
the 0 221 25
drug 0 221 25
so 0 221 25
far, 0 221 25
two 0 221 25
have 0 221 25
died. 0 221 25

ZMapp 0 221 26
show 0 221 26
“promise,” 0 221 26
although 0 221 26
scientific 0 221 26
results 0 221 26
are 0 221 26
not 0 221 26
definitive. 0 221 26

The 0 221 27
risk 0 221 27
of 0 221 27
Ebola 0 221 27
spreading 0 221 27
within 0 221 27
Congo 0 221 27
is 0 221 27
“very 1 221 27
high,” 1 221 27
according 0 221 27
to 0 221 27
authorities, 0 221 27
and 0 221 27
the 1 221 27
disease 1 221 27
could 1 221 27
also 1 221 27
move 1 221 27
into 1 221 27
nine 1 221 27
neighboring 1 221 27
countries, 1 221 27
the 0 221 27
World 0 221 27
Health 0 221 27
Organization 0 221 27
has 0 221 27
warned. 0 221 27

The 0 221 28
WHO, 0 221 28
however, 0 221 28
stopped 0 221 28
short 0 221 28
of 0 221 28
declaring 0 221 28
the 0 221 28
outbreak 0 221 28
a 0 221 28
global 0 221 28
health 0 221 28
emergency. 0 221 28

WHO 0 221 29
said 0 221 29
there 0 221 29
should 0 221 29
not 0 221 29
be 0 221 29
restrictions 0 221 29
on 0 221 29
international 0 221 29
travel 0 221 29
or 0 221 29
trade. 0 221 29

In 0 221 30
the 0 221 30
meantime, 0 221 30
it’s 0 221 30
important 0 221 30
to 0 221 30
prevent 0 221 30
oneself 0 221 30
from 0 221 30
contracting 0 221 30
the 0 221 30
virus. 0 221 30

Unfortunately, 0 221 31
health 0 221 31
care 0 221 31
workers 0 221 31
are 0 221 31
at 0 221 31

as 0 221 31
they 0 221 31
try 0 221 31
to 0 221 31
cull 0 221 31
the 0 221 31

which 0 221 31

why 0 221 31
they 0 221 31

my 0 230 25
words 0 230 25
against 0 230 25
me 0 230 25
by 0 230 25

the 0 230 25

about 0 230 25

He 0 230 26
is 0 230 26
using 0 230 26
my 0 230 26
arguments 0 230 26
I 0 230 26
made 0 230 26
to 0 230 26
him 0 230 26
yesterday 0 230 26
to 0 230 26
protect 0 230 26
the 0 230 26
teacher. 0 230 26

The 0 230 27
teacher 0 230 27
today 0 230 27
told 0 230 27
the 0 230 27
students 0 230 27
the 0 230 27
assignment 0 230 27
was 0 230 27
optional. 0 230 27

My 0 230 28
daughter 0 230 28
as 0 230 28
well 0 230 28
as 0 230 28
other 0 230 28
students 0 230 28
were 0 230 28
under 0 230 28
the 0 230 28
impression 0 230 28
all 0 230 28
the 0 230 28
packet 0 230 28
assignments 0 230 28
were 0 230 28
mandatory 0 230 28
(the 0 230 28
Jewish 0 230 28
one 0 230 28
and 0 230 28
the 0 230 28
Christian 0 230 28
ones 0 230 28
were 0 230 28
mandatory). 0 230 28

I 0 230 29
wrote 0 230 29
to 0 230 29
Dr. 0 230 29

Branch 0 230 30
to 0 230 30
share 0 230 30
with 0 230 30
him 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
resource 0 230 30
that 0 230 30
Miss 0 230 30
Hinson 0 230 30
used 0 230 30
and 0 230 30
point 0 230 30
out 0 230 30
that 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
material 0 230 30
she 0 230 30
gave 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
students 0 230 30
did 0 230 30
not 0 230 30
include 0 230 30
all 0 230 30
the 0 230 30
faith 0 230 30
aspects 0 230 30
for 0 230 30
Christianity. 0 230 30

The 0 230 31
students 0 230 31
received 0 230 31
2 0 230 31
pages 0 230 31
for 0 230 31
Christianity 0 230 31
from 0 230 31
this 0 230 31
resource 0 230 31
while 0 230 31
all 0 230 31
the 0 230 31
Islamic 0 230 31
sections 0 230 31
were 0 230 31
left 0 230 31
intact. 0 230 31

Here’s 0 230 32
the 0 230 32
link 0 230 32
for 0 230 32
you 0 230 32
to 0 230 32
review. 0 230 32

You 0 230 33
will 0 230 33
notice 0 230 33
all 0 230 33
the 0 230 33
faith 0 230 33
elements 0 230 33
were 0 230 33
left 0 230 33
out 0 230 33
for 0 230 33
Judaism 0 230 33
and 0 230 33
Christianity 0 230 33
while 0 230 33
the 0 230 33
Islamic 0 230 33
section 0 230 33
was 0 230 33
left 0 230 33
the 0 230 33
way 0 230 33
it’s 0 230 33
presented. 0 230 33

https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf 0 230 34
So 0 230 34
she 0 230 34
decided 0 230 34
to 0 230 34
use 0 230 34
the 0 230 34
extra 0 230 34
resources 0 230 34
for 0 230 34
Islam 0 230 34
and 0 230 34
the 0 230 34
school 0 230 34
is 0 230 34
saying 0 230 34
that’s 0 230 34
not 0 230 34
indoctrination 0 230 34
or 0 230 34
proselytizing? 0 230 34

The 0 230 35
faith 0 230 35
aspects 0 230 35
and 0 230 35
the 0 230 35
same 0 230 35
considerations 0 230 35
were 0 230 35
not 0 230 35
given 0 230 35
to 0 230 35
the 0 230 35
others 0 230 35
as 0 230 35
they 0 230 35
were 0 230 35
for 0 230 35
Islam. 0 230 35

This 0 230 36
actually 0 230 36
further 0 230 36
proves 0 230 36
my 0 230 36
point 0 230 36
that 0 230 36
Islam 0 230 36
was 0 230 36
afforded 0 230 36
special 0 230 36
privilege 0 230 36
over 0 230 36
the 0 230 36
others. 0 230 36

The 0 230 37
school 0 230 37
is 0 230 37
backtracking 0 230 37
and 0 230 37
being 0 230 37
deceptive 0 230 37
to 0 230 37
try 0 230 37
and 0 230 37
weasel 0 230 37
out 0 230 37
of 0 230 37
this. 0 230 37

The 0 230 38
teacher 0 230 38
today 0 230 38
clarified 0 230 38
things 0 230 38
for 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
students 0 230 38
but 0 230 38
that 0 230 38
still 0 230 38
does 0 230 38
not 0 230 38
excuse 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
fact 0 230 38
that 0 230 38
they 0 230 38
are 0 230 38
teaching 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
Islamic 0 230 38
faith 0 230 38
and 0 230 38
asking 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
kids 0 230 38
to 0 230 38
participate 0 230 38
in 0 230 38
Sharia. 0 230 38

Look 0 230 39
at 0 230 39
the 0 230 39
Islamic 0 230 39
packet 0 230 39
again. 0 230 39

They 0 230 40
are 0 230 40
asking 0 230 40
the 0 230 40
kids 0 230 40
to 0 230 40
write 0 230 40
the 0 230 40
beginning 0 230 40
of 0 230 40
Surahs. 0 230 40

The 0 230 41
teacher 0 230 41
still 0 230 41
has 0 230 41
not 0 230 41
corrected 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
error 0 230 41
that 0 230 41
calligraphy 0 230 41
was 0 230 41
started 0 230 41
by 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
arabs. 0 230 41

They 0 230 42
are 0 230 42
doubling 0 230 42
down 0 230 42
and 0 230 42
only 0 230 42
after 0 230 42
being 0 230 42
called 0 230 42
on 0 230 42
it 0 230 42
are 0 230 42
they 0 230 42
trying 0 230 42
to 0 230 42
backtrack. 0 230 42

Rich 0 230 43
Penkoski 0 230 43
is 0 230 43
hardly 0 230 43
the 0 230 43

In 0 230 44
Volusia 0 230 44

had 0 230 45
Floridians 0 230 45
in 0 230 45
a 0 230 45
frenzy. 1 230 45

And 0 230 46
who 0 230 46

the 0 230 48

here). 0 230 48

We 0 230 49
have 0 230 49
seen 0 230 49
the 0 230 49
increasing 0 230 49
Islamization 1 230 49
of 0 230 49
the 0 230 49

History 0 230 50
lessons 0 230 50
in 0 230 50

are 0 230 50
dawah 0 230 50

proselytizing 0 230 50
for 0 230 50

In 0 230 52
West 0 230 52
Virginia, 0 230 52
it 0 230 52
gets 0 230 52
even 0 230 52
worse. 0 230 52

Rich 0 230 53
Penkoski 0 230 53
has 0 230 53
alerted 0 230 53
me 0 230 53
to 0 230 53
the 0 230 53
latest 0 230 53
development 0 230 53
in 0 230 53
the 0 230 53

of 0 230 53
his 0 230 53
children’s 0 230 53

curriculum: 0 230 53
after 0 230 53
the 0 230 53
Daily 0 230 53
Caller 0 230 53
and 0 230 53
Geller 0 230 53
Report 0 230 53
exposed 0 230 53
what 0 230 53
was 0 230 53
happening, 0 230 53
Mountain 0 230 53
Ridge 0 230 53
administrators 0 230 53
and 0 230 53
teachers 0 230 53
began 0 230 53
messaging 0 230 53
parents 0 230 53
who 0 230 53
were 0 230 53
sharing 0 230 53
the 0 230 53

asking 0 230 53
them 0 230 53
to 0 230 53
remove 0 230 53
their 0 230 53
posts. 0 230 53

What 0 230 54
do 0 230 54
they 0 230 54
have 0 230 54
to 0 230 54
hide? 0 230 54

Apparently, 0 230 55
a 0 230 55
great 0 230 55
deal. 0 230 55

Worse 0 230 56
still, 0 230 56
Penkoski 0 230 56
is 0 230 56
now 0 230 56
being 0 230 56
threatened 1 230 56
by 0 230 56
students 0 230 56
who 0 230 56
attend 0 230 56
the 0 230 56

with 0 230 56
his 0 230 56
daughter. 0 230 56

(And 0 230 57
who 0 230 57
is 0 230 57
behind 0 230 57
them? 0 230 57

Unidentified 0 230 58
“adult 0 230 58
friends.”) 0 230 58

He 0 230 59
sent 0 230 59
this 0 230 59
message 0 230 59
to 0 230 59
me: 0 230 59

A 0 230 60
student 0 230 60
in 0 230 60
the 0 230 60
school 0 230 60
threatened 1 230 60
to 0 230 60
get 0 230 60
her 0 230 60
adult 0 230 60
friends 0 230 60
to 0 230 60
come 0 230 60
to 0 230 60
my 0 230 60
home 0 230 60
and 0 230 60
kill 1 230 60
me 0 230 60
by 0 230 60
stabbing 0 230 60
me 0 230 60
in 0 230 60
the 0 230 60
chest 0 230 60
and 0 230 60
ripping 1 230 60
my 1 230 60
organs 1 230 60
out. 1 230 60

They 0 230 61
told 0 230 61
my 0 230 61
daughter 0 230 61
“we 0 230 61
are 0 230 61
gonna 0 230 61
get 0 230 61
some 0 230 61
people 0 230 61
and 0 230 61
kill 1 230 61
your 0 230 61
dad.” 0 230 61
This 0 230 61
student, 0 230 61
who 0 230 61
is 0 230 61
known 0 230 61
to 0 230 61
me 0 230 61
but 0 230 61
whom 0 230 61
I 0 230 61
cannot 0 230 61
name 0 230 61
because 0 230 61
she 0 230 61
is 0 230 61
a 0 230 61
minor, 0 230 61
has 0 230 61
given 0 230 61
students 0 230 61
our 0 230 61
address 0 230 61
and 0 230 61
is 0 230 61
encouraging 0 230 61
them 0 230 61
to 0 230 61
come 0 230 61
to 0 230 61
my 0 230 61
home 0 230 61
over 0 230 61
this 0 230 61
whole 0 230 61
thing. 0 230 61

Another 0 230 62
student 0 230 62
told 0 230 62
my 0 230 62
daughter 0 230 62
that 0 230 62
she 0 230 62
and 0 230 62
the 0 230 62
first 0 230 62

are 0 230 62
going 0 230 62
to 0 230 62

rip 1 230 62
out 1 230 62
my 1 230 62
organs. 1 230 62

They 0 230 63
then 0 230 63
threatened 1 230 63
to 0 230 63
hang 1 230 63
my 1 230 63
3-year-old 1 230 63

and 1 230 63
kidnap 1 230 63
my 1 230 63

All 0 230 64
this 0 230 64
in 0 230 64
school 0 230 64
today 0 230 64
because 0 230 64
of 0 230 64
the 0 230 64
articles. 0 230 64

This 0 230 65
is 0 230 65
not 0 230 65
a 0 230 65
joke 0 230 65
and 0 230 65
needs 0 230 65
to 0 230 65
be 0 230 65
investigated. 0 230 65

I 0 230 66
have 0 230 66
contacted 0 230 66
the 0 230 66
school’s 0 230 66
principal, 0 230 66
Dr. 0 230 66

Branch, 0 230 67
and 0 230 67
I 0 230 67
trust 0 230 67
that 0 230 67
he 0 230 67
will 0 230 67
take 0 230 67
this 0 230 67
matter 0 230 67
seriously 0 230 67
and 0 230 67
deal 0 230 67
with 0 230 67
it 0 230 67
appropriately. 0 230 67

Is 1 230 68
the 1 230 68
principal 1 230 68
acting 1 230 68
on 1 230 68
this? 1 230 68

And 1 230 69
do 1 230 69
the 1 230 69
police 1 230 69
have 1 230 69
any 1 230 69
interest 1 230 69
in 1 230 69
this? 1 230 69

Or 1 230 70
would 1 230 70
that 1 230 70
be 1 230 70
“islamofauxbic”? 1 230 70

the 0 348 3

cornered 0 348 4
her 0 348 4

woman’s 0 348 5

her, 0 348 5

she 0 348 5

she 0 348 5
managed 0 348 5
to 0 348 5

herself 0 348 5

bolt 0 348 5
out 0 348 5

the 0 348 5

Kavanaugh, 0 348 6
53, 0 348 6
vehemently 1 348 6
denied 1 348 6
the 0 348 6
woman’s 0 348 6

“I 0 348 7
categorically 1 348 7

outright 0 348 9

The 0 348 10

over 0 350 3
what? 0 350 3

An 0 350 4
unprovable 0 350 4

allegations 0 350 13
against 0 350 13
Brett 0 350 13

— 0 350 13

are 0 350 13
substantial 0 350 13
and 0 350 13
serious. 0 350 13

She 0 350 14
claims 0 350 14
that 0 350 14
Kavanaugh 0 350 14
knocked 0 350 14
her 0 350 14
down, 0 350 14
groped 0 350 14
her, 0 350 14
and 0 350 14
attempted 0 350 14
to 0 350 14
remove 0 350 14
her 0 350 14
clothes. 0 350 14

Here’s 0 350 15
the 0 350 15
core 0 350 15
of 0 350 15
her 0 350 15
story: 0 350 15

While 0 350 16
his 0 350 16
friend 0 350 16
watched, 0 350 16
she 0 350 16
said, 0 350 16
Kavanaugh 0 350 16
pinned 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
to 0 350 16
a 0 350 16
bed 0 350 16
on 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
back 0 350 16
and 0 350 16
groped 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
over 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
clothes, 0 350 16
grinding 0 350 16
his 0 350 16
body 0 350 16
against 0 350 16
hers 0 350 16
and 0 350 16
clumsily 0 350 16
attempting 0 350 16
to 0 350 16
pull 0 350 16
off 0 350 16
her 0 350 16
one-piece 0 350 16
bathing 0 350 16
suit 0 350 16
and 0 350 16
the 0 350 16
clothing 0 350 16
she 0 350 16
wore 0 350 16
over 0 350 16
it. 0 350 16

When 0 350 17
she 0 350 17
tried 0 350 17
to 0 350 17
scream, 0 350 17
she 0 350 17
said, 0 350 17
he 0 350 17
put 0 350 17
his 0 350 17
hand 0 350 17
over 0 350 17
her 0 350 17
mouth. 0 350 17

“I 0 350 18
thought 0 350 18
he 0 350 18
might 0 350 18
inadvertently 0 350 18
kill 0 350 18
me,” 0 350 18
said 0 350 18
Ford, 0 350 18
now 0 350 18
a 0 350 18
51-year-old 0 350 18
research 0 350 18
psychologist 0 350 18
in 0 350 18
northern 0 350 18
California. 0 350 18

“He 0 350 19
was 0 350 19
trying 0 350 19
to 0 350 19
attack 0 350 19
me 0 350 19
and 0 350 19
remove 0 350 19
my 0 350 19
clothing.” 0 350 19
Ford 0 350 19
said 0 350 19
she 0 350 19
was 0 350 19
able 0 350 19
to 0 350 19
escape 0 350 19
when 0 350 19
Kavanaugh’s 0 350 19
friend 0 350 19
and 0 350 19
classmate 0 350 19
at 0 350 19
Georgetown 0 350 19
Preparatory 0 350 19
School, 0 350 19
Mark 0 350 19
Judge, 0 350 19
jumped 0 350 19
on 0 350 19
top 0 350 19
of 0 350 19
them, 0 350 19
sending 0 350 19
all 0 350 19
three 0 350 19
tumbling. 0 350 19

She 0 350 20
said 0 350 20
she 0 350 20
ran 0 350 20
from 0 350 20
the 0 350 20
room, 0 350 20
briefly 0 350 20
locked 0 350 20
herself 0 350 20
in 0 350 20
a 0 350 20
bathroom 0 350 20
and 0 350 20
then 0 350 20
fled 0 350 20
the 0 350 20
house. 0 350 20

Do 0 350 21
not 0 350 21
count 0 350 21
me 0 350 21
among 0 350 21
those 0 350 21
who 0 350 21
would 0 350 21
minimize 0 350 21
this 0 350 21
alleged 0 350 21
assault. 0 350 21

I 0 350 22
went 0 350 22
to 0 350 22
a 0 350 22
high 0 350 22
school 0 350 22
that 0 350 22
had 0 350 22
more 0 350 22
than 0 350 22
its 0 350 22
share 0 350 22
of 0 350 22
drunken 0 350 22
parties, 0 350 22
and 0 350 22
my 0 350 22
classmates 0 350 22
could 0 350 22
do 0 350 22
crazy 0 350 22
and 0 350 22
stupid 0 350 22
things, 0 350 22
but 0 350 22
an 0 350 22
act 0 350 22
like 0 350 22
this 0 350 22
was 0 350 22
beyond 0 350 22
the 0 350 22
pale. 0 350 22

This 0 350 23
isn’t 0 350 23
“boys 1 350 23
will 1 350 23
be 1 350 23
boys.” 1 350 23
Actions 0 350 23
have 0 350 23
consequences, 0 350 23
and 0 350 23
it’s 0 350 23
hardly 0 350 23
unjust 0 350 23
to 0 350 23
tell 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
person 0 350 23
that 0 350 23
if 0 350 23
he 0 350 23
mistreated 0 350 23
another 0 350 23
human 0 350 23
being 0 350 23
like 0 350 23
this 0 350 23
— 0 350 23
even 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
long 0 350 23
time 0 350 23
ago 0 350 23
— 0 350 23
he 0 350 23
has 0 350 23
to 0 350 23
remain 0 350 23
“merely” 0 350 23
a 0 350 23
judge 0 350 23
on 0 350 23
the 0 350 23
D.C. 0 350 23

Circuit 0 350 24
Court 0 350 24
of 0 350 24
Appeals. 0 350 24

Since 0 350 25
Kavanaugh 0 350 25
has 0 350 25
denied 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
story, 0 350 25
however, 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
question 0 350 25
of 0 350 25
whether 0 350 25
the 0 350 25
event 0 350 25
is 0 350 25
so 0 350 25
egregious 0 350 25
that 0 350 25
it 0 350 25
should 0 350 25
disqualify 0 350 25
him 0 350 25
is 0 350 25
moot. 0 350 25

At 0 350 26
the 0 350 26
very 0 350 26
least, 0 350 26
if 0 350 26
the 0 350 26
attack 0 350 26
happened, 0 350 26
he 0 350 26
should 0 350 26
be 0 350 26
disqualified 0 350 26
for 0 350 26
lying. 0 350 26

Yet 0 350 27
unless 0 350 27
all 0 350 27
parties 0 350 27
start 0 350 27
telling 0 350 27
the 0 350 27
same 0 350 27
story, 0 350 27
there 0 350 27
is 0 350 27
no 0 350 27
way 0 350 27
to 0 350 27
know 0 350 27
for 0 350 27
certain 0 350 27
if 0 350 27
this 0 350 27
event 0 350 27
occurred. 0 350 27

We 0 350 28
don’t 0 350 28
need 0 350 28
certainty, 0 350 28
however, 0 350 28
to 0 350 28
make 0 350 28
a 0 350 28
decision 0 350 28
on 0 350 28
whether 0 350 28
a 0 350 28
man 0 350 28
should 0 350 28
sit 0 350 28
on 0 350 28
the 0 350 28
Supreme 0 350 28
Court. 0 350 28

I 0 350 29
have 0 350 29
the 0 350 29
same 0 350 29
standard 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Brett 0 350 29
Kavanaugh 0 350 29
as 0 350 29
I 0 350 29
did 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Roy 0 350 29
Moore, 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Donald 0 350 29
Trump, 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
Bill 0 350 29
Clinton 0 350 29
— 0 350 29
or 0 350 29
for 0 350 29
any 0 350 29
other 0 350 29
politician 0 350 29
who’s 0 350 29
accused 0 350 29
of 0 350 29
misconduct. 0 350 29

Is 0 350 30
it 0 350 30
more 0 350 30
likely 0 350 30
than 0 350 30
not 0 350 30
that 0 350 30
the 0 350 30
allegation 0 350 30
is 0 350 30
true? 0 350 30

Given 0 350 31
the 0 350 31
totality 0 350 31
of 0 350 31
the 0 350 31
evidence, 0 350 31
I 0 350 31
believe 0 350 31
it 0 350 31
is 0 350 31
more 0 350 31
likely 0 350 31
than 0 350 31
not 0 350 31
that 0 350 31
Bill 0 350 31
Clinton 0 350 31
committed 0 350 31
rape 0 350 31
and 0 350 31
sexual 0 350 31
harassment. 0 350 31

I 0 350 32
believe 0 350 32
it 0 350 32
is 0 350 32
more 0 350 32
likely 0 350 32
than 0 350 32
not 0 350 32
that 0 350 32
Donald 0 350 32
Trump 0 350 32
has 0 350 32
committed 0 350 32
sexual 0 350 32
assault. 0 350 32

I 0 350 33
believe 0 350 33
it 0 350 33
is 0 350 33
more 0 350 33
likely 0 350 33
than 0 350 33
not 0 350 33
that 0 350 33
Roy 0 350 33
Moore 0 350 33
engaged 0 350 33
in 0 350 33
sexual 0 350 33
misconduct 0 350 33
with 0 350 33
underage 0 350 33
girls. 0 350 33

But 0 350 34
the 0 350 34
evidence 0 350 34
against 0 350 34
Kavanaugh 0 350 34
falls 0 350 34
far 0 350 34
short 0 350 34
of 0 350 34
the 0 350 34
evidence 0 350 34
arrayed 0 350 34
against 0 350 34
each 0 350 34
of 0 350 34
these 0 350 34
men. 0 350 34

So 0 350 35
far 0 350 35
at 0 350 35
least 0 350 35
it 1 350 35
falls 1 350 35
far 1 350 35
short 1 350 35
of 1 350 35
the 1 350 35
evidence 1 350 35
against 1 350 35
virtually 1 350 35
any 1 350 35
other 1 350 35
politician 1 350 35
or 1 350 35
celebrity 1 350 35
who 1 350 35
has 1 350 35
faced 1 350 35
consequences 1 350 35
during 0 350 35
this 0 350 35
#MeToo 0 350 35
moment. 0 350 35

Here’s 0 350 36
why: 0 350 36

First, 0 350 37
one 0 350 37
way 0 350 37
to 0 350 37
help 0 350 37
test 0 350 37
the 0 350 37
veracity 0 350 37
of 0 350 37
old 0 350 37
claims 0 350 37
is 0 350 37
to 0 350 37
ask 0 350 37
whether 0 350 37
there 0 350 37
is 0 350 37
any 0 350 37
contemporaneous 0 350 37
corroboration. 0 350 37

Did 0 350 38
the 0 350 38
accuser 0 350 38
tell 0 350 38
a 0 350 38
friend 0 350 38
or 0 350 38
family 0 350 38
member 0 350 38
or 0 350 38
anyone 0 350 38
about 0 350 38
the 0 350 38
alleged 0 350 38
assault 0 350 38
when 0 350 38
it 0 350 38
occurred? 0 350 38

With 0 350 39
Clinton, 0 350 39
Trump, 0 350 39
Moore, 0 350 39
and 0 350 39
many 0 350 39
other 0 350 39
politicians 0 350 39
and 0 350 39
celebrities, 0 350 39
there 0 350 39
was 0 350 39
ample 0 350 39
contemporaneous 0 350 39
corroboration. 0 350 39

Here, 0 350 40
there 0 350 40
was 0 350 40
not. 0 350 40

According 0 350 41
to 0 350 41
the 0 350 41
Washington 0 350 41
Post, 0 350 41
“Ford 0 350 41
said 0 350 41
she 0 350 41
told 0 350 41
no 0 350 41
one 0 350 41
of 0 350 41
the 0 350 41
incident 0 350 41
in 0 350 41
any 0 350 41
detail 0 350 41
until 0 350 41
2012, 0 350 41
when 0 350 41
she 0 350 41
was 0 350 41
in 0 350 41
couples 0 350 41
therapy 0 350 41
with 0 350 41
her 0 350 41
husband.” 0 350 41

That’s 0 350 42
almost 0 350 42
three 0 350 42
decades 0 350 42
of 0 350 42
silence 0 350 42
— 0 350 42
three 0 350 42
decades 0 350 42
when 0 350 42
memories 0 350 42
can 0 350 42
grow 0 350 42
cloudy 0 350 42
and 0 350 42
recollections 0 350 42
can 0 350 42
change. 0 350 42

But 0 350 43
even 0 350 43
the 0 350 43
allegedly 0 350 43
corroborating 0 350 43
notes 0 350 43
of 0 350 43
the 0 350 43
therapist 0 350 43
raise 0 350 43
a 0 350 43
separate 0 350 43

her 0 350 44
story 0 350 44
on 0 350 44
a 0 350 44
key 0 350 44
detail. 0 350 44

According 0 350 45
to 0 350 45
the 0 350 45
Post, 0 350 45
“The 0 350 45
notes 0 350 45
say 0 350 45
four 0 350 45
boys 0 350 45
were 0 350 45
involved, 0 350 45
a 0 350 45
discrepancy 0 350 45
that 0 350 45
Ford 0 350 45
says 0 350 45
was 0 350 45
an 0 350 45
error 0 350 45
on 0 350 45
the 0 350 45
therapist’s 0 350 45
part. 0 350 45

Ford 0 350 46
said 0 350 46
there 0 350 46
were 0 350 46
four 0 350 46
boys 0 350 46
at 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
party 0 350 46
but 0 350 46
only 0 350 46
two 0 350 46
in 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
room.” 0 350 46
Nor 0 350 46
do 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
notes 0 350 46
mention 0 350 46
Kavanaugh’s 0 350 46
name, 0 350 46
even 0 350 46
though 0 350 46
her 0 350 46
husband 0 350 46
says 0 350 46
Ford 0 350 46
named 0 350 46
Kavanaugh 0 350 46
in 0 350 46
the 0 350 46
sessions. 0 350 46

Those 0 350 47
are 0 350 47
important 0 350 47
discrepancies, 0 350 47
and 1 350 47
if 1 350 47
six 1 350 47
years 1 350 47
ago 1 350 47
she 1 350 47
told 1 350 47
the 1 350 47
therapist 1 350 47
four 1 350 47
men 1 350 47
and 1 350 47
says 1 350 47
two 1 350 47
men 1 350 47
now, 1 350 47
that 1 350 47
suggests 1 350 47
that 1 350 47
her 1 350 47
memory 1 350 47
of 1 350 47
the 1 350 47
event 1 350 47
may 1 350 47
be 1 350 47
suspect. 1 350 47

As 0 350 48
a 0 350 48
former 0 350 48
trial 0 350 48
lawyer, 0 350 48
I 1 350 48
can 1 350 48
tell 1 350 48
you 1 350 48
that 1 350 48
while 1 350 48
neither 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
nor 1 350 48
memories 1 350 48
are 1 350 48
infallible, 1 350 48
in 1 350 48
a 1 350 48
contest 1 350 48
between 1 350 48
contemporaneous 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
and 1 350 48
later 1 350 48
verbal 1 350 48
testimony 1 350 48
about 1 350 48
those 1 350 48
notes, 1 350 48
the 1 350 48
content 1 350 48
of 1 350 48
the 1 350 48
written 1 350 48
notes 1 350 48
usually 1 350 48
prevails. 1 350 48

Juries 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
extremely 1 350 49
skeptical 1 350 49
of 0 350 49
witnesses 0 350 49
who 0 350 49
contradict 0 350 49
written 0 350 49
notes 0 350 49
— 0 350 49
after 0 350 49
all, 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
notes 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
taken 0 350 49
when 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
words 0 350 49
are 0 350 49
immediate 0 350 49
and 0 350 49
there 0 350 49
isn’t 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
overwhelming 0 350 49
pressure 0 350 49
of 0 350 49
a 0 350 49
trial 0 350 49
to 0 350 49
conform 0 350 49
your 0 350 49
testimony 0 350 49
to 0 350 49
the 0 350 49
desired 0 350 49
outcome. 0 350 49

At 0 350 50
least 0 350 50
the 0 350 50
investigation 0 350 50
seems 0 350 50
somewhat 0 350 50
manageable. 0 350 50

If 0 350 51
there 0 350 51
were 0 350 51
only 0 350 51
four 0 350 51
boys 0 350 51
there, 0 350 51
who 0 350 51
were 0 350 51
the 0 350 51
other 0 350 51
two? 0 350 51

Let’s 0 350 52
hear 0 350 52
from 0 350 52
them. 0 350 52

In 0 350 53
fact, 0 350 53
investigators 0 350 53
should 0 350 53
interview 0 350 53
everyone 0 350 53
else 0 350 53
at 0 350 53
the 0 350 53
party. 0 350 53

Yet 0 350 54
given 0 350 54
all 0 350 54
the 0 350 54
years 0 350 54
that 0 350 54
have 0 350 54
passed, 0 350 54
would 0 350 54
it 0 350 54
be 0 350 54
possible 0 350 54
to 0 350 54
find 0 350 54
anyone 0 350 54
who 0 350 54
remembers 0 350 54
being 0 350 54
at 0 350 54
that 0 350 54
party? 0 350 54

Would 0 350 55
they 0 350 55
remember 0 350 55
any 0 350 55
details 0 350 55
at 0 350 55
all? 0 350 55

If 0 350 56
someone 0 350 56
saw 0 350 56
Kavanaugh 0 350 56
stumbling 1 350 56
drunk 1 350 56
at 0 350 56
the 0 350 56
party, 0 350 56
that 0 350 56
would 0 350 56
obviously 0 350 56
bolster 0 350 56
Ford’s 0 350 56
account. 0 350 56

If 0 350 57
another 0 350 57
attendee 0 350 57
says, 0 350 57
“He 0 350 57
was 0 350 57
totally 0 350 57
sober 0 350 57
and 0 350 57
with 0 350 57
me 0 350 57

in 0 351 20
the 0 351 20

suggested 0 351 20
that 0 351 20

of 0 351 20

“No 1 351 21

bat 1 351 21
an 1 351 21

Thomas 0 351 21

“If 1 351 22

who 1 351 22
owned 1 351 22
guns, 1 351 22
that’s 1 351 22
not 1 351 22
a 1 351 22
big 1 351 22
deal 1 351 22
because 1 351 22
there’s 1 351 22
a 1 351 22

If 1 351 23
these 1 351 23
were 1 351 23
white 1 351 23
Christians, 1 351 23
faith 1 351 23
healing 1 351 23
is 1 351 23
of 1 351 23
no 1 351 23
consequence 1 351 23
because 1 351 23
we 1 351 23
have 1 351 23

But 1 351 24
they 1 351 24
look 1 351 24
different 1 351 24
and 1 351 24
they 1 351 24

differently 1 351 24

the 0 354 17
North 0 354 17
Texas 0 354 17
area 0 354 17
sums 0 354 17
up 0 354 17
the 0 354 17
treatment 0 354 17
of 0 354 17
Guyger 0 354 17
perfectly 0 354 17
when 0 354 17
he 0 354 17
says 0 354 17
that 0 354 17
“The 0 354 17
affidavit 0 354 17
isn’t 0 354 17
written 0 354 17
objectively, 0 354 17
not 0 354 17
at 0 354 17
the 0 354 17
slightest. 0 354 17

As 0 354 18
stated 0 354 18
before, 0 354 18
they 0 354 18
are 0 354 18
usually 0 354 18
wholly 0 354 18
against 0 354 18
the 0 354 18
accused. 0 354 18

An 0 354 19
objective 0 354 19
view 0 354 19
of 0 354 19
the 0 354 19
information 0 354 19
related 0 354 19
by 0 354 19
the 0 354 19
officer 0 354 19
would 0 354 19
be 0 354 19
proper, 0 354 19
in 0 354 19
my 0 354 19
opinion. 0 354 19

This 0 354 20
affidavit 0 354 20
states 0 354 20
facts 0 354 20
based 0 354 20
upon 0 354 20
the 0 354 20
word 0 354 20
of 0 354 20
the 0 354 20
person 0 354 20
it 0 354 20
seeks 0 354 20
to 0 354 20
accuse 0 354 20
of 0 354 20
criminal 0 354 20
wrongdoing.” 0 354 20

What’s 0 354 21
more, 0 354 21
according 0 354 21
to 0 354 21
WFAA, 0 354 21
who 0 354 21
obtained 0 354 21
affidavits 0 354 21
for 0 354 21
all 0 354 21
of 0 354 21
the 0 354 21
search 0 354 21
warrants 0 354 21
involved 0 354 21
in 0 354 21
the 0 354 21
case, 0 354 21
none 0 354 21
of 0 354 21
them 0 354 21
involved 0 354 21
the 0 354 21
search 0 354 21
of 0 354 21
Guyger’s 0 354 21
apartment. 0 354 21

For 0 354 22
those 0 354 22
who 0 354 22
don’t 0 354 22
recall, 0 354 22
police 0 354 22
egregiously 1 354 22
released 0 354 22
the 0 354 22
search 0 354 22
warrant 0 354 22
findings 0 354 22
of 0 354 22
Jean’s 0 354 22
apartment 0 354 22
on 0 354 22
the 0 354 22
day 0 354 22
his 0 354 22
family 0 354 22
buried 0 354 22
his 0 354 22
dead 0 354 22
body. 0 354 22

They 0 354 23
attempted 0 354 23
to 0 354 23
assassinate 0 354 23
Jean’s 0 354 23
character 0 354 23
by 0 354 23
claiming 0 354 23
they 0 354 23
found 0 354 23
less 0 354 23
than 0 354 23
a 0 354 23
half 0 354 23
ounce 0 354 23
of 0 354 23
weed 0 354 23
in 0 354 23
his 0 354 23
apartment. 0 354 23

However, 0 354 24
they 0 354 24
failed 0 354 24
miserably 1 354 24
at 0 354 24
it. 0 354 24

One 0 354 25
thing 0 354 25
in 0 354 25
particular, 0 354 25
however, 0 354 25
stood 0 354 25
out 0 354 25
to 0 354 25
those 0 354 25
paying 0 354 25
attention 0 354 25
and 0 354 25
that 0 354 25
is 0 354 25
the 0 354 25
fact 0 354 25
the 0 354 25
police 0 354 25
didn’t 0 354 25
release 0 354 25
any 0 354 25
information 0 354 25
on 0 354 25
what 0 354 25
they 0 354 25
found 0 354 25
in 0 354 25
Guyger’s 0 354 25
apartment. 0 354 25

According 0 354 26
to 0 354 26
the 0 354 26
information 0 354 26
currently 0 354 26
available, 0 354 26
that’s 0 354 26
because 0 354 26
they 0 354 26
didn’t 0 354 26
search 0 354 26
it. 0 354 26

According 0 354 27
to 0 354 27
WFAA, 0 354 27
there 0 354 27
were 0 354 27
five 0 354 27
search 0 354 27
warrants 0 354 27
issued 0 354 27
in 0 354 27
the 0 354 27
case—none 0 354 27
of 0 354 27
which 0 354 27
were 0 354 27
for 0 354 27
the 0 354 27
killer’s 0 354 27
apartment. 0 354 27

As 0 354 28
WFAA 0 354 28
reports: 0 354 28

Two 0 354 29
of 0 354 29
the 0 354 29

An 0 354 30

that 0 354 30
they 0 354 30

A 0 354 31
third 0 354 31
search 0 354 31
warrant 0 354 31
gave 0 354 31
investigators 0 354 31
the 0 354 31

to 0 354 31

and 0 354 31
collect 0 354 31
additional 0 354 31
evidence. 0 354 31

A 0 354 32

that 0 354 32
investigators 0 354 32
took 0 354 32

for 0 354 33
the 0 354 33
fourth 0 354 33

A 0 354 34
fifth 0 354 34

gave 0 354 34
investigators 0 354 34

the 0 354 34

An 0 354 35
inventory 0 354 35
return 0 354 35

investigators 0 354 35
seized 0 354 35

Now, 0 354 36
even 0 354 36
if 0 354 36
police 0 354 36
would 0 354 36
try 0 354 36

On 0 354 37
Sunday, 0 354 37
apartment 0 354 37

notified 0 354 37

A 0 354 38
manager 0 354 38
at 0 354 38
the 0 354 38

declined 0 354 38

exactly 0 354 38
when 0 354 38
Guyger 0 354 38

Pope 1 355 2
Bergoglio 1 355 2
with 0 355 2
the 0 355 2
following 0 355 2
headline: 0 355 2
“Does 1 355 2
Francis 1 355 2
know 1 355 2
he 1 355 2
sounds 1 355 2
like 1 355 2
an 1 355 2
abuser?” 1 355 2

The 0 355 3
scales 0 355 3
have 0 355 3
fallen 0 355 3
from 0 355 3
Fisher’s 0 355 3
eyes 0 355 3
and 0 355 3
now, 0 355 3
at 0 355 3
last, 0 355 3
she 0 355 3
sees 0 355 3
Bergoglio, 0 355 3
however 0 355 3
grudgingly, 0 355 3
for 0 355 3
what 0 355 3
he 0 355 3
is: 0 355 3
a 1 355 3
power-mad 1 355 3
ecclesiastical 1 355 3
tyrant. 1 355 3

(A 0 355 4
tyrant, 0 355 4
moreover, 0 355 4
who 0 355 4
has 0 355 4
ascended 0 355 4
to 0 355 4
the 0 355 4
papacy 0 355 4
in 0 355 4
a 0 355 4
manner 0 355 4
reminiscent 0 355 4
of 0 355 4
the 0 355 4
ascension 0 355 4
of 0 355 4
the 1 355 4
corrupt 1 355 4
Benedict 1 355 4
IX, 1 355 4
another 0 355 4
“disgrace 1 355 4
to 1 355 4
the 1 355 4
Chair 1 355 4
of 1 355 4
Peter,” 1 355 4
following 0 355 4
the 0 355 4
machinations 0 355 4
of 0 355 4
a 0 355 4
Roman 0 355 4
cabal, 0 355 4
as 0 355 4
I 0 355 4
discuss 0 355 4
below.) 0 355 4

Quoth 0 355 5
Fisher: 0 355 5

I 0 355 6
have 0 355 6
a 0 355 6
number 0 355 6
of 0 355 6
friends 0 355 6
who 0 355 6
have 0 355 6
escaped 0 355 6
abusive 0 355 6
marriages. 0 355 6

They 0 355 7
tell 0 355 7
me 0 355 7
that 0 355 7
Pope 1 355 7
Francis 1 355 7
is 1 355 7
sounding 1 355 7
more 1 355 7
and 1 355 7
more 1 355 7
like 1 355 7
the 1 355 7
men 1 355 7
who 1 355 7
abused 1 355 7
them. 1 355 7

He’s 1 355 8
sounding 1 355 8
like 1 355 8
the 1 355 8
men 1 355 8
who 1 355 8
hid 1 355 8
that 1 355 8
abuse 1 355 8
from 1 355 8
the 1 355 8
world, 1 355 8
who 1 355 8
taught 1 355 8
their 1 355 8
victims 1 355 8
to 1 355 8
blame 1 355 8
themselves, 1 355 8
who 1 355 8
used 1 355 8
spiritual 1 355 8
pressure 1 355 8
to 1 355 8
persuade 1 355 8
them 1 355 8
and 1 355 8
their 1 355 8
families 1 355 8
that 1 355 8
it 1 355 8
would 1 355 8
actually 1 355 8
be 1 355 8
wrong, 1 355 8
sinful, 1 355 8
to 1 355 8
defend 1 355 8
themselves. 1 355 8

Just 0 355 9
listen 0 355 9
to 0 355 9
him. 0 355 9

After 0 355 10
responding 0 355 10
to 0 355 10
a 0 355 10
question 0 355 10
about 0 355 10
Vigano’s 0 355 10
very 0 355 10
serious 0 355 10
accusations, 0 355 10
he 0 355 10
said 0 355 10
point 0 355 10
blank, 0 355 10
“I 0 355 10
will 0 355 10
not 0 355 10
say 0 355 10
a 0 355 10
single 0 355 10
word 0 355 10
on 0 355 10
this.”… 0 355 10
[F]or 0 355 10
the 0 355 10
rest 0 355 10
of 0 355 10
the 0 355 10
week 0 355 10
and 0 355 10
more, 0 355 10
he 0 355 10
kept 0 355 10
up 0 355 10
an 0 355 10
unmistakable 0 355 10
theme 0 355 10
of 0 355 10
calling 0 355 10
for 0 355 10
silence, 0 355 10
equating 0 355 10
silence 0 355 10
with 0 355 10
holiness, 0 355 10
and 0 355 10
painting 0 355 10
himself 0 355 10
as 0 355 10
a 1 355 10
Christlike 1 355 10
victim 1 355 10
in 0 355 10
his 0 355 10
silence. 0 355 10

Then 0 355 11
he 0 355 11
says 0 355 11
it’s 0 355 11
“ugly” 0 355 11
to 0 355 11
accuse 0 355 11
others 0 355 11
of 0 355 11
sinning. 0 355 11

Then 0 355 12
he 0 355 12
suggests 0 355 12
that 0 355 12
healing 1 355 12
and 1 355 12
reconciliation 1 355 12
will 1 355 12
only 1 355 12
come 1 355 12
if 1 355 12
we 1 355 12
take 1 355 12
a 1 355 12
hard 1 355 12
look 1 355 12
at 1 355 12
our 1 355 12
own 1 355 12
flaws…. 1 355 12

To 1 355 13
the 1 355 13
victims 1 355 13
of 1 355 13
the 1 355 13
Church, 1 355 13
and 1 355 13
to 1 355 13
those 1 355 13
who 1 355 13
love 1 355 13
them, 1 355 13
it 1 355 13
sounds 1 355 13
like 1 355 13
he 1 355 13
is 1 355 13
saying, 1 355 13
“Who 1 355 13
do 1 355 13
you 1 355 13
think 1 355 13
you 1 355 13
are? 1 355 13

I 1 355 14
don’t 1 355 14
have 1 355 14
to 1 355 14
explain 1 355 14
myself 1 355 14
to 1 355 14
you. 1 355 14

You’re 1 355 15
the 1 355 15
guilty 1 355 15
one. 1 355 15

You 1 355 16
brought 1 355 16
this 1 355 16
on 1 355 16
yourself. 1 355 16

If 1 355 17
you 1 355 17
want 1 355 17
to 1 355 17
be 1 355 17
loved, 1 355 17
then 1 355 17
know 1 355 17
your 1 355 17
place. 1 355 17

I’m 1 355 18
the 1 355 18
victim, 1 355 18
here, 1 355 18
not 1 355 18
you. 1 355 18

If 1 355 19
you 1 355 19
know 1 355 19
what’s 1 355 19
good 1 355 19
for 1 355 19
you, 1 355 19
keep 1 355 19
your 1 355 19
mouth 1 355 19
shut.” 1 355 19
This 1 355 19
is 1 355 19
how 1 355 19
abusers 1 355 19
talk. 1 355 19

They’re 1 355 20
not 1 355 20
content 1 355 20
with 1 355 20
power; 1 355 20
they 1 355 20
have 1 355 20
to 1 355 20
keep 1 355 20
their 1 355 20
victims 1 355 20
doubting 1 355 20
and 1 355 20
blaming 1 355 20
themselves 1 355 20
constantly, 1 355 20
so 1 355 20
they 1 355 20
don’t 1 355 20
become 1 355 20
a 1 355 20
threat. 1 355 20

Whether 1 355 21
Francis 1 355 21
knows 1 355 21
it 1 355 21
or 1 355 21
not, 1 355 21
this 1 355 21
is 1 355 21
how 1 355 21
he 1 355 21
sounds. 1 355 21

We 0 355 22
can 0 355 22
overlook 0 355 22
the 0 355 22
fig 0 355 22
leaf 0 355 22
“whether 0 355 22
Francis 0 355 22
knows 0 355 22
it 0 355 22
or 0 355 22
not…”. 0 355 22

Fisher 1 355 23
knows 1 355 23
that 1 355 23
Francis 1 355 23
knows 1 355 23
it, 1 355 23
even 1 355 23
if 1 355 23
she 1 355 23
still 1 355 23
cannot 1 355 23
bring 1 355 23
herself 1 355 23
to 1 355 23
say 1 355 23
explicitly 1 355 23
what 1 355 23
should 1 355 23
now 1 355 23
be 1 355 23
apparent 1 355 23
to 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
entire 1 355 23
body 1 355 23
of 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
faithful: 1 355 23
that 0 355 23
Bergoglio’s 1 355 23
very 1 355 23
presence 1 355 23
on 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
Chair 1 355 23
of 1 355 23
Peter 1 355 23
is 1 355 23
a 1 355 23
grave 1 355 23
threat 1 355 23
to 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
common 1 355 23

of 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
Church 1 355 23
and 1 355 23

integrity 1 355 23
of 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
Faith. 1 355 23

Yet 0 355 25
Fisher 0 355 25
maintains 0 355 25
a 0 355 25
sliver 0 355 25
of 0 355 25
space 0 355 25
for 0 355 25
deniability 0 355 25
in 0 355 25
order 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
maintain 0 355 25
that 0 355 25
indispensable 0 355 25
distinction 0 355 25
between 0 355 25
her 0 355 25
and 0 355 25
those 1 355 25
loathsome 1 355 25
traditionalists: 1 355 25
“I 0 355 25
don’t 0 355 25
have 0 355 25
any 0 355 25
ideological 0 355 25
reason 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
want 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
bring 0 355 25
him 0 355 25
down. 0 355 25

I 0 355 26
have 0 355 26
defended 0 355 26
him 0 355 26
as 0 355 26
long 0 355 26
as 0 355 26
I 0 355 26
could, 0 355 26
up 0 355 26
until 0 355 26
the 0 355 26
Chile 0 355 26
debacle. 0 355 26

And 0 355 27
so 0 355 27
I 0 355 27
am 0 355 27
working 0 355 27
as 0 355 27
hard 0 355 27
as 0 355 27
I 0 355 27
can 0 355 27
not 0 355 27
to 0 355 27
assume 0 355 27
the 0 355 27
worst, 0 355 27
not 0 355 27
to 0 355 27
believe 0 355 27
that 0 355 27
this 1 355 27
man 1 355 27
who 1 355 27
promised 1 355 27
so 1 355 27
much 1 355 27
fresh 1 355 27
air 1 355 27
is 1 355 27
really 1 355 27
so 1 355 27
intent 1 355 27
on 1 355 27
slamming 1 355 27
doors 1 355 27
shut 1 355 27
before 1 355 27
we 1 355 27
find 1 355 27
out 1 355 27
even 1 355 27
worse 1 355 27
things 1 355 27
hidden 1 355 27
inside. 1 355 27

But 1 355 28
he 1 355 28
is 1 355 28
not 1 355 28
making 1 355 28
it 1 355 28
easy. 1 355 28

I 1 355 29
am 1 355 29
not 1 355 29
saying 1 355 29
he 1 355 29
is 1 355 29
an 1 355 29
abuser. 1 355 29

But 1 355 30
he 1 355 30
sounds 1 355 30
like 1 355 30
one.” 1 355 30

That 0 355 31
is, 0 355 31
Fisher 0 355 31
was 0 355 31
not 0 355 31
concerned 0 355 31
about 0 355 31
Bergoglio’s 0 355 31
relentless 1 355 31
assault 1 355 31
on 0 355 31
traditional 0 355 31
Catholic 0 355 31
teaching 0 355 31
and 0 355 31
practice—to 0 355 31
her, 0 355 31
opposition 0 355 31
to 0 355 31
Francis 0 355 31
on 0 355 31
that 0 355 31
account 0 355 31
is 0 355 31
just 0 355 31
“ideology”—but 0 355 31
only 0 355 31
his 0 355 31
role 0 355 31
in 0 355 31
covering 0 355 31
up 0 355 31
sexual 0 355 31
abuse 0 355 31
by 0 355 31
bishops 0 355 31
and 0 355 31
priests. 0 355 31

But 0 355 32
why 0 355 32
is 0 355 32
Fisher 0 355 32
still 0 355 32
“working 0 355 32
hard 0 355 32
not 0 355 32
to 0 355 32
assume 0 355 32
the 0 355 32
worst” 0 355 32
when 0 355 32
there 0 355 32
is 0 355 32
no 0 355 32
longer 0 355 32
anything 0 355 32
to 0 355 32
assume 0 355 32
as 0 355 32
the 0 355 32
ever-mounting 0 355 32
evidence 0 355 32
of 0 355 32
malintent 0 355 32
has 0 355 32
been 0 355 32
in 0 355 32
plain 0 355 32
view 0 355 32
for 0 355 32
years? 0 355 32

Indeed, 0 355 33
why 0 355 33
else 0 355 33
did 0 355 33
Archbishop 0 355 33
Viganò 0 355 33
risk 1 355 33
everything 1 355 33
in 0 355 33
order 0 355 33
to 0 355 33
expose 0 355 33
this 0 355 33
Pope, 0 355 33
even 0 355 33
to 0 355 33
the 0 355 33
extent 0 355 33
of 0 355 33
revealing 0 355 33
matters 0 355 33
supposedly 0 355 33
within 0 355 33
the 0 355 33
scope 0 355 33
of 0 355 33
“the 0 355 33

near 0 355 50
Rome, 0 355 50
in 0 355 50
1046, 0 355 50
which 0 355 50

three 0 355 50
rival 0 355 50
claimants 0 355 50
to 0 355 50
the 0 355 50
papacy, 0 355 50
each 0 355 50
installed 0 355 50
by 0 355 50
a 0 355 50
Roman 0 355 50
faction: 0 355 50
First, 0 355 50
the 1 355 50
execrable 1 355 50
Benedict 1 355 50
IX, 1 355 50
mentioned 0 355 50
above. 0 355 50

the 1 355 52
well-intentioned 1 355 52

Gregory 1 355 52

whose 0 355 52
election 0 355 52

negotiation 0 355 52

Benedict, 0 355 52
who 0 355 52
had 0 355 52
returned 0 355 52
to 0 355 52
Rome 0 355 52
in 0 355 52
1045 0 355 52
and 0 355 52
ousted 0 355 52
Sylvester, 0 355 52
according 0 355 52
to 0 355 52
which 0 355 52
Benedict 0 355 52
would 0 355 52
receive 0 355 52
a 0 355 52
generous 0 355 52

the 0 355 52

which 0 355 52
Benedict 0 355 52
did 0 355 52
only 0 355 52
to 0 355 52
rescind 0 355 52
his 0 355 52
resignation. 0 355 52

The 0 355 54

had 0 355 54

As 0 355 55
for 0 355 55
Sylvester, 0 355 55
the 0 355 55
Synod 0 355 55
declared 0 355 55
that 0 355 55

“stripped 1 355 55
of 1 355 55

shut 1 355 55
up 1 355 55

monastery.” 1 355 55
Gregory 0 355 55

either 0 355 55

only 0 355 56
a 0 355 56

“the 0 355 60

as 0 355 63
a 0 355 63
true 0 355 63

Moreover, 0 355 64
Benedict 0 355 64
IX 0 355 64
himself 0 355 64
is 0 355 64
recognized 0 355 64
as 0 355 64
a 0 355 64

the 0 355 64
canon 0 355 64
of 0 355 64
Popes. 0 355 64

This 0 355 65
was 0 355 65
possible 0 355 65
owing 0 355 65
to 0 355 65
the 0 355 65
lack 0 355 65
of 0 355 65
any 0 355 65
set 0 355 65

even 0 355 66
the 0 355 66
Vatican’s 0 355 66
own 0 355 66
website 0 355 66
states 0 355 66
that 0 355 66
Benedict 0 355 66
was 0 355 66
Pope 0 355 66
from 0 355 66
1047-1048, 0 355 66

which 0 355 66

was 0 355 66
finally 0 355 66
driven 0 355 66
by 0 355 66
force. 0 355 66

By 0 355 68
1100 0 355 68
what 0 355 68
we 0 355 68
now 0 355 68
know 0 355 68
as 0 355 68
the 0 355 68
College 0 355 68
of 0 355 68
Cardinals, 0 355 68
embracing 0 355 68
all 0 355 68
the 0 355 68
cardinals 0 355 68
of 0 355 68
different 0 355 68
titles, 0 355 68
had 0 355 68
the 0 355 68
exclusive 0 355 68
right 0 355 68
to 0 355 68
elect 0 355 68
a 0 355 68

and 0 355 68
the 0 355 68
members 0 355 68
of 0 355 68
the 0 355 68
College 0 355 68
“have 0 355 68
held 0 355 68
it 0 355 68
ever 0 355 68
since.” 0 355 68
(Eric 0 355 68
John, 0 355 68

These 0 355 69
lessons 0 355 69
of 0 355 69
history 0 355 69
should 0 355 69
suffice 0 355 69
to 1 355 69
dispel 1 355 69
the 1 355 69
pious 1 355 69
fable, 1 355 69
never 0 355 69
a 0 355 69
teaching 0 355 69
of 0 355 69
the 0 355 69
Magisterium, 0 355 69
that 0 355 69
every 0 355 69
Pope 0 355 69
is 0 355 69
chosen 0 355 69
by 0 355 69
the 0 355 69
Holy 0 355 69
Ghost 0 355 69
to 0 355 69
lead 0 355 69
the 0 355 69
Church. 0 355 69

This 0 355 70
theological 0 355 70
error, 0 355 70
which 0 355 70
Bergoglio 0 355 70
has 1 355 70
exploited 1 355 70
to 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
hilt, 1 355 70
is 0 355 70
a 0 355 70
key 0 355 70
element 0 355 70
in 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
related 0 355 70
error 0 355 70
of 0 355 70
papalotry, 0 355 70
which 0 355 70
elevates 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
person 0 355 70
of 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
Pope 0 355 70
above 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
office 0 355 70
he 0 355 70
occupies 0 355 70
and 0 355 70
makes 0 355 70
of 0 355 70
him 0 355 70
the 1 355 70
leader 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
a 1 355 70
personality 1 355 70
cult 1 355 70
everyone 1 355 70
is 1 355 70
commanded 1 355 70
to 1 355 70
“love” 1 355 70
(in 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
superficially 1 355 70
emotional 1 355 70
sense) 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
obey 1 355 70
no 1 355 70
matter 1 355 70
what 1 355 70
he 1 355 70
says 1 355 70
or 1 355 70
does, 1 355 70
rather 0 355 70
than 0 355 70
a 1 355 70
custodian 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
defender 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
Deposit 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
Faith 1 355 70
whose 1 355 70
lovability, 1 355 70
personality 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
opinions 1 355 70
are 1 355 70
utterly 1 355 70
irrelevant 1 355 70
to 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
exercise 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
scope 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
his 1 355 70
office. 1 355 70

As 0 355 71
Pope 0 355 71
Benedict 0 355 71
has 0 355 71
observed, 0 355 71
when 0 355 71
it 0 355 71
comes 0 355 71
to 0 355 71
the 0 355 71
election 0 355 71
of 0 355 71
a 0 355 71
Pope 0 355 71
“the 0 355 71
Spirit’s 0 355 71
role 0 355 71
should 0 355 71
be 0 355 71
understood 0 355 71
in 0 355 71
a 0 355 71
much 0 355 71
more 0 355 71
elastic 0 355 71
sense, 0 355 71
not 0 355 71
that 0 355 71
he 0 355 71
[sic] 0 355 71
dictates 0 355 71
the 0 355 71
candidate 0 355 71
for 0 355 71
whom 0 355 71
one 0 355 71
must 0 355 71
vote…. 0 355 71

There 1 355 72
are 1 355 72
too 1 355 72
many 1 355 72
contrary 1 355 72
instances 1 355 72
of 1 355 72
popes 1 355 72
the 1 355 72
Holy 1 355 72
Spirit 1 355 72
obviously 1 355 72
would 1 355 72
not 1 355 72
have 1 355 72
picked!” 1 355 72
Bergoglio 1 355 72
is 1 355 72
undeniably 1 355 72
one 1 355 72
of 1 355 72
them. 1 355 72

So 0 355 73
what 0 355 73
can 0 355 73
be 0 355 73
done 0 355 73
to 0 355 73
defend 0 355 73
the 0 355 73
Church 0 355 73
against 0 355 73
Bergoglio? 0 355 73

That 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
mode 0 355 74
of 0 355 74
papal 0 355 74
election 0 355 74
by 0 355 74
cardinals 0 355 74
has 0 355 74
persisted 0 355 74
for 0 355 74
nearly 0 355 74
a 0 355 74
thousand 0 355 74
years 0 355 74
has 0 355 74
led 0 355 74
to 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
general 0 355 74
impression 0 355 74
that 0 355 74
it 0 355 74
pertains 0 355 74
to 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
irreformable 0 355 74
divine 0 355 74
constitution 0 355 74
of 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
Church, 0 355 74
but 0 355 74
it 0 355 74
certainly 0 355 74
does 0 355 74
not. 0 355 74

As 0 355 75
to 0 355 75
matters 0 355 75
of 0 355 75
purely 0 355 75
ecclesiastical 0 355 75
law 0 355 75
such 0 355 75
as 0 355 75
this 0 355 75
one 0 355 75
the 0 355 75
Church 0 355 75
has 0 355 75
always 0 355 75
allowed 0 355 75
for 0 355 75
departures 0 355 75
from 0 355 75
traditional 0 355 75
practice 0 355 75
in 0 355 75
cases 0 355 75
of 0 355 75
emergency 0 355 75
or 0 355 75
grave 0 355 75
necessity. 0 355 75

And 0 355 76
just 0 355 76
as 0 355 76
a 0 355 76
synod 0 355 76
was 0 355 76
employed 0 355 76
to 0 355 76
address 0 355 76
three 0 355 76
rival 0 355 76
claimants 0 355 76
to 0 355 76
the 0 355 76
papal 0 355 76
throne 0 355 76
in 0 355 76
1046, 0 355 76
declaring 0 355 76
at 0 355 76
least 0 355 76
two 0 355 76
of 0 355 76
them 0 355 76
deposed, 0 355 76
so 0 355 76
today 0 355 76
might 0 355 76
it 0 355 76
be 0 355 76
possible 0 355 76
for 0 355 76
reform-minded 0 355 76
cardinals 0 355 76
and 0 355 76
bishops, 0 355 76
comprising 0 355 76
an 0 355 76
imperfect 0 355 76
council, 0 355 76
to 0 355 76
undo 0 355 76
the 1 355 76
incalculable 1 355 76
damage 1 355 76
caused 0 355 76
by 0 355 76
the 0 355 76
cabal 0 355 76
that 0 355 76
lobbied 0 355 76
for 0 355 76
Bergoglio’s 0 355 76
election 0 355 76
before 0 355 76
the 0 355 76
last 0 355 76
conclave—a 0 355 76
cabal 0 355 76
that 0 355 76
included 0 355 76
none 0 355 76
other 0 355 76
than 0 355 76
McCarrick, 0 355 76
whom 0 355 76
Bergoglio 0 355 76
rewarded 0 355 76
by 0 355 76
rehabilitating 0 355 76
that 1 355 76
monster 1 355 76
despite 0 355 76
the 1 355 76
massive 1 355 76
evidence 1 355 76
of 1 355 76
his 1 355 76
unspeakable 1 355 76
crimes. 1 355 76

What 0 355 77
would 0 355 77
be 0 355 77
the 0 355 77
grounds 0 355 77
for 0 355 77
a 0 355 77
declaration 0 355 77
of 0 355 77
deposition 0 355 77
at 0 355 77
such 0 355 77
a 0 355 77
gathering 0 355 77
of 0 355 77
prelates? 0 355 77

One 0 355 78
could 0 355 78
readily 0 355 78
point 0 355 78
to 0 355 78
the 0 355 78
evidence 0 355 78
that 0 355 78

his 0 355 78
election 0 355 78
before 0 355 78

which 1 355 78
provides: 1 355 78

The 1 355 79
Cardinal 1 355 79
electors 1 355 79
shall 1 355 79
further 1 355 79
abstain 1 355 79
from 1 355 79
any 1 355 79

or 1 355 79
other 1 355 79
commitment 1 355 79
of 1 355 79
any 1 355 79
kind 1 355 79
which 1 355 79
could 1 355 79
oblige 1 355 79
them 1 355 79
to 1 355 79
give 1 355 79

deny 1 355 79

a 1 355 79
person 1 355 79

If 1 355 80
this 1 355 80

in 1 355 80
fact 1 355 80
done, 1 355 80
even 1 355 80
under 1 355 80
oath, 1 355 80
I 1 355 80
decree 1 355 80
that 1 355 80
such 1 355 80
a 1 355 80
commitment 1 355 80
shall 1 355 80
be 1 355 80
null 1 355 80
and 1 355 80
void 1 355 80

that 1 355 80
no 1 355 80

be 1 355 80
bound 1 355 80
to 1 355 80
observe 1 355 80
it; 1 355 80
and 1 355 80
I 1 355 80
hereby 1 355 80
impose 1 355 80
the 1 355 80
penalty 1 355 80
of 1 355 80
excommunication 1 355 80
latae 1 355 80
sententiae 1 355 80
upon 1 355 80
those 1 355 80

deposition 1 355 81
by 1 355 81
an 1 355 81
imperfect 1 355 81
council 1 355 81
is 1 355 81
appropriate 1 355 81
“when 1 355 81
one 1 355 81
or 1 355 81
more 1 355 81
Popes 1 355 81
suffer 1 355 81
uncertainty 1 355 81
with 1 355 81
regard 1 355 81
to 1 355 81
their 1 355 81
election, 1 355 81
as 1 355 81
seems 1 355 81
to 1 355 81
have 1 355 81
arisen 1 355 81
in 1 355 81
the 1 355 81
schism 1 355 81
of 1 355 81
Urban 1 355 81
VI 1 355 81
and 1 355 81
others. 1 355 81

Then, 1 355 82
lest 1 355 82
the 1 355 82
Church 1 355 82
be 1 355 82
perplexed, 1 355 82
those 1 355 82
members 1 355 82
of 1 355 82
the 1 355 82
Church 1 355 82

are 1 355 82

the 1 355 82
power 1 355 82
to 1 355 82
judge 1 355 82
which 1 355 82
is 1 355 82
the 1 355 82
true 1 355 82
pope, 1 355 82
if 1 355 82
it 1 355 82
can 1 355 82
be 1 355 82
known, 1 355 82
and 1 355 82
if 1 355 82
it 1 355 82
cannot 1 355 82
be 1 355 82

[it 1 355 82
has] 1 355 82
the 1 355 82
power 1 355 82
to 1 355 82
provide 1 355 82
that 1 355 82
the 1 355 82

on 1 355 82
one 1 355 82
or 1 355 82
another 1 355 82
of 1 355 82
them.” 1 355 82

I 0 355 83
am 0 355 83
not 0 355 83
saying 0 355 83
that 0 355 83
such 0 355 83
a 0 355 83
case 0 355 83
has 0 355 83
been 0 355 83
proven. 0 355 83

Rather, 0 355 84
what 0 355 84
I 0 355 84
am 0 355 84
saying 0 355 84
is 0 355 84
that 0 355 84
this 0 355 84
hypothetical 0 355 84
imperfect 0 355 84
council 0 355 84
could 0 355 84
determine 0 355 84
that 0 355 84
it 0 355 84
has 0 355 84
been 0 355 84
proven 0 355 84
and 0 355 84
act 0 355 84
accordingly, 0 355 84
and 0 355 84
that 0 355 84
the 0 355 84
Church 0 355 84
would 0 355 84
judge 0 355 84
any 0 355 84
resulting 0 355 84
deposition 0 355 84
of 0 355 84
Bergoglio 0 355 84
in 0 355 84
the 0 355 84
same 0 355 84
manner 0 355 84
it 0 355 84
judges 0 355 84
the 0 355 84
deposition 0 355 84
of 0 355 84
Benedict 0 355 84
IX. 0 355 84

Another 0 355 85
ground 0 355 85
for 0 355 85
deposition—as 0 355 85
determined 0 355 85
by 0 355 85
the 0 355 85
imperfect 0 355 85
council, 0 355 85
not 0 355 85
any 0 355 85
of 0 355 85
us—would 0 355 85
be 0 355 85
that 0 355 85
Bergoglio 1 355 85
has 1 355 85
deposed 1 355 85
himself 1 355 85
by 1 355 85
promulgating 1 355 85
heresy, 1 355 85
fracturing 1 355 85
the 1 355 85
Church’s 1 355 85
universal 1 355 85
discipline 1 355 85
respecting 1 355 85
marriage 1 355 85
and 1 355 85
the 1 355 85
Eucharist, 1 355 85
and 1 355 85
undermining 1 355 85
the 1 355 85
teaching 1 355 85
of 1 355 85
even 1 355 85
his 1 355 85
own 1 355 85
immediate 1 355 85
predecessors 1 355 85
on 1 355 85
matters 1 355 85
of 1 355 85
fundamental 1 355 85
morality 1 355 85
upheld 1 355 85
by 1 355 85
the 1 355 85
Magisterium 1 355 85
for 1 355 85
two 1 355 85
millennia. 1 355 85

Surely 0 355 86
the 0 355 86
Church 0 355 86
cannot 0 355 86
be 0 355 86
without 0 355 86
any 0 355 86
remedy 0 355 86
for 0 355 86
a 1 355 86
Pope 1 355 86
who 1 355 86
relentlessly 1 355 86
attacks 1 355 86
her 1 355 86
very 1 355 86
foundations! 1 355 86

To 1 355 87
quote 1 355 87
Cajetan 1 355 87
again: 1 355 87
“Indeed 1 355 87
the 1 355 87
Church 1 355 87
has 1 355 87
the 1 355 87
right 1 355 87
to 1 355 87
separate 1 355 87
herself 1 355 87
from 1 355 87
an 1 355 87
heretical 1 355 87
pope 1 355 87
according 1 355 87
to 1 355 87
divine 1 355 87
law. 1 355 87

Consequently, 1 355 88
it 1 355 88
has 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
right, 1 355 88
by 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
same 1 355 88
divine 1 355 88
law, 1 355 88
to 1 355 88
use 1 355 88
all 1 355 88
means 1 355 88
of 1 355 88
themselves 1 355 88
necessary 1 355 88
for 1 355 88
such 1 355 88
separation; 1 355 88
and 1 355 88
those 1 355 88
that 1 355 88
juridically 1 355 88
correspond 1 355 88
to 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
crime, 1 355 88
are 1 355 88
of 1 355 88
themselves 1 355 88
necessary”—meaning 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
resort 1 355 88
to 1 355 88
an 1 355 88
imperfect 1 355 88
council. 1 355 88

If 0 355 89
a 0 355 89
synod 0 355 89
was 0 355 89
able 0 355 89
to 0 355 89
declare 0 355 89
the 0 355 89
deposition 0 355 89
of 0 355 89
a 0 355 89
pope 0 355 89
in 0 355 89
1046, 0 355 89
why 0 355 89
not 0 355 89
an 0 355 89
imperfect 0 355 89
council 0 355 89
today—or, 0 355 89
for 0 355 89
that 0 355 89
matter, 0 355 89
another 0 355 89
synod? 0 355 89

It 0 355 90
will 0 355 90
be 0 355 90
argued 0 355 90
that 0 355 90
such 0 355 90
a 0 355 90
deposition 0 355 90
would 0 355 90
provoke 0 355 90
massive 0 355 90
schisms 0 355 90
in 0 355 90
the 0 355 90
Church. 0 355 90

But 0 355 91
that 0 355 91
would 0 355 91
not 0 355 91
be 0 355 91
the 0 355 91
first 0 355 91
time 0 355 91
that 0 355 91
defense 0 355 91
of 0 355 91
the 0 355 91
Church’s 0 355 91
common 0 355 91
good 0 355 91
has 0 355 91
done 0 355 91
so, 0 355 91
as 0 355 91
the 0 355 91
Great 0 355 91
Western 0 355 91
Schism 0 355 91
demonstrates. 0 355 91

And 1 355 92
are 1 355 92
we 1 355 92
not 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
the 1 355 92
midst 1 355 92
of 1 355 92
schisms 1 355 92
already, 1 355 92
provoked 1 355 92
by 1 355 92
none 1 355 92
other 1 355 92
than 1 355 92
Bergoglio 1 355 92
himself, 1 355 92
whose 1 355 92
insane 1 355 92
drive 1 355 92
to 1 355 92
shatter 1 355 92
the 1 355 92
Church’s 1 355 92
bimillennial 1 355 92
discipline 1 355 92
has 1 355 92
produced 1 355 92
the 1 355 92
totally 1 355 92
unprecedented 1 355 92
situation 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
which 1 355 92
what 1 355 92
is 1 355 92
still 1 355 92
considered 1 355 92
mortally 1 355 92
sinful 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
one 1 355 92
diocese 1 355 92
is 1 355 92
an 1 355 92
imperative 1 355 92
of 1 355 92
“mercy” 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
another? 1 355 92

In 0 355 93
any 0 355 93
case, 0 355 93
this 0 355 93
much 0 355 93
is 0 355 93
certain: 0 355 93
barring 0 355 93
Bergoglio’s 0 355 93
conversion 0 355 93
and 0 355 93
reversal 0 355 93
of 0 355 93
course, 0 355 93
the 0 355 93
Church 0 355 93
cannot 0 355 93
abide 0 355 93
this 0 355 93
pontificate 0 355 93
any 0 355 93
longer. 0 355 93

One 0 355 94
way 0 355 94
or 0 355 94
another, 0 355 94
the 0 355 94
Church 0 355 94
will 0 355 94
have 0 355 94
to 0 355 94
repel 0 355 94
an 0 355 94
attacker 0 355 94
at 0 355 94
her 0 355 94
very 0 355 94
summit. 0 355 94

Either 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
human 1 355 95
element 1 355 95
of 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
Church 1 355 95
will 1 355 95
act 1 355 95
according 1 355 95
to 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
means 1 355 95
which 1 355 95
seem 1 355 95
possible, 1 355 95
however 1 355 95
extraordinary, 1 355 95
or 1 355 95
Heaven 1 355 95
itself 1 355 95
will 1 355 95
intervene 1 355 95
in 0 355 95
a 0 355 95
manner 0 355 95
that 0 355 95
might 0 355 95
well 0 355 95
involve 0 355 95
a 0 355 95
divine 0 355 95
chastisement 0 355 95
due 0 355 95
to 0 355 95
the 1 355 95
negligence 1 355 95
of 1 355 95
time-serving 1 355 95
pastors 1 355 95
who 1 355 95
left 1 355 95
their 1 355 95
sheep 1 355 95
completely 1 355 95
undefended 1 355 95
against 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
wolves 1 355 95
who 1 355 95
preyed 1 355 95
upon 1 355 95
them, 1 355 95
including 0 355 95
the 1 355 95
wolf 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
cardinals 1 355 95
improvidently 1 355 95
elected 1 355 95
Pope. 1 355 95

Some 0 355 96
four 0 355 96

territory 0 355 96
in 0 355 96

that 0 355 96

with 0 355 96
Protestants 0 355 96

that 0 355 96

did 0 356 25
kill 0 356 25
him. 0 356 25

This 0 356 26
is 0 356 26
a 0 356 26
fact. 0 356 26

This 0 356 27
public 0 356 27
servant 0 356 27
walked 0 356 27
into 0 356 27
an 0 356 27
innocent 1 356 27
man’s 0 356 27
home 0 356 27
and 0 356 27
shot 0 356 27
him 0 356 27
dead. 0 356 27

Because 0 356 28
of 0 356 28
her 0 356 28
actions, 0 356 28
this 0 356 28
man 0 356 28
no 0 356 28
longer 0 356 28
lives. 0 356 28

That, 0 356 29
Senator 0 356 29
Ted 0 356 29
Cruz, 0 356 29
is 0 356 29
wrong. 0 356 29

Mistake 0 356 30
or 0 356 30
not, 0 356 30
she 0 356 30
killed 0 356 30
an 0 356 30
innocent 1 356 30
man. 0 356 30

She 0 356 31
is 0 356 31
the 0 356 31
only 0 356 31
one 0 356 31
to 0 356 31
blame 0 356 31
and 0 356 31
yet 0 356 31
she 0 356 31
is 0 356 31
still 0 356 31
collecting 0 356 31
a 0 356 31
paycheck 0 356 31
from 0 356 31
taxpayers. 0 356 31

Calling 0 356 32
for 0 356 32
Gugyer 0 356 32
to 0 356 32
be 0 356 32
fired 0 356 32
is 0 356 32
not 0 356 32
the 0 356 32
same 0 356 32
as 0 356 32
calling 0 356 32
for 0 356 32
people 0 356 32
to 0 356 32
be 0 356 32
fired 0 356 32
for 0 356 32
making 0 356 32
stupid 0 356 32
Instagram 0 356 32
posts 0 356 32
or 0 356 32
saying 0 356 32
stupid 0 356 32
things—she 0 356 32
killed 0 356 32
an 0 356 32
innocent 1 356 32
man. 0 356 32

At 0 356 33
the 0 356 33
very 0 356 33
least, 0 356 33
she 0 356 33
should 0 356 33
be 0 356 33
fired 0 356 33
from 0 356 33
her 0 356 33
job 0 356 33
which 0 356 33
gave 0 356 33
her 0 356 33
the 0 356 33
gun 0 356 33
to 0 356 33
do 0 356 33
it. 0 356 33

What 0 356 34
Ted 0 356 34
Cruz 0 356 34
is 0 356 34
doing 0 356 34
is 0 356 34
the 0 356 34
same 0 356 34
thing 0 356 34
the 0 356 34
police 0 356 34
and 0 356 34
their 0 356 34
apologists 0 356 34
are 0 356 34
doing. 0 356 34

They 0 356 35
are 0 356 35
treating 0 356 35
Guyger 0 356 35
differently 0 356 35
because 0 356 35
she 0 356 35
is 0 356 35
part 0 356 35
of 0 356 35
the 0 356 35
system. 0 356 35

In 0 356 36
Cruz’s 0 356 36
eyes, 0 356 36
Guyger 0 356 36
going 0 356 36
into 0 356 36
an 0 356 36
apartment 0 356 36
that 0 356 36
wasn’t 0 356 36
her’s 0 356 36
and 0 356 36
killing 0 356 36
an 0 356 36
innocent 1 356 36
man 0 356 36
was 0 356 36
simply 0 356 36
a 0 356 36
case 0 356 36
of 0 356 36
being 0 356 36
in 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
wrong 0 356 36
place 0 356 36
at 0 356 36
the 0 356 36
wrong 0 356 36
time—a 0 356 36
tragic 0 356 36
mistake 0 356 36
that 0 356 36
ruined 0 356 36
two 0 356 36
lives, 0 356 36
according 0 356 36
to 0 356 36
Cruz. 0 356 36

But 0 356 37
that 0 356 37
is 0 356 37
not 0 356 37
the 0 356 37
case 0 356 37
at 0 356 37
all. 0 356 37

Would 0 356 38
Ted 0 356 38
Cruz 0 356 38
and 0 356 38
police 0 356 38
officers 0 356 38
be 0 356 38
following 0 356 38
this 0 356 38
same 0 356 38
narrative 0 356 38
if 0 356 38
the 0 356 38
roles 0 356 38
were 0 356 38
reversed? 0 356 38

If 0 356 39
it 0 356 39
was 0 356 39
Botham 0 356 39
Jean, 0 356 39
a 1 356 39
black 1 356 39
man, 1 356 39
walking 0 356 39
into 0 356 39
the 0 356 39
apartment 0 356 39
of 0 356 39
Amber 0 356 39
Guyger, 0 356 39
a 0 356 39
white 1 356 39
female 1 356 39
cop, 1 356 39
and 0 356 39
killing 0 356 39
her—would 0 356 39
police 0 356 39
and 0 356 39
Ted 0 356 39
Cruz 0 356 39
simply 0 356 39
write 0 356 39
it 0 356 39
off 0 356 39
as 0 356 39
a 0 356 39
tragic 0 356 39
accident? 0 356 39

Of 0 356 40
course, 0 356 40
we 0 356 40
know 0 356 40
the 0 356 40
answer 0 356 40
to 0 356 40
that 0 356 40
question 0 356 40
and 0 356 40
it 0 356 40
is 0 356 40
a 0 356 40
resounding, 0 356 40
NO. 0 356 40

To 0 356 41
shut 0 356 41
down 0 356 41
the 0 356 41
peanut 0 356 41
gallery 0 356 41
before 0 356 41
it 0 356 41
begins, 0 356 41
this 0 356 41
is 0 356 41
not 0 356 41
some 0 356 41
case 0 356 41
of 0 356 41
Democrat 0 356 41
versus 0 356 41
Republican 0 356 41
or 0 356 41
right 0 356 41
versus 0 356 41
left. 0 356 41

This 0 356 42
is 0 356 42
a 0 356 42
case 0 356 42
of 0 356 42
right 0 356 42
versus 0 356 42
wrong, 0 356 42
and 0 356 42
what 0 356 42
Amber 0 356 42
Guyger 0 356 42
did 0 356 42
to 0 356 42
Botham 0 356 42
Jean 0 356 42
was 0 356 42
wrong. 0 356 42

There 0 356 43
is 0 356 43
no 0 356 43
other 0 356 43
way 0 356 43
around 0 356 43
it, 0 356 43
“mistake” 0 356 43
or 0 356 43
not. 0 356 43

From 0 356 44
the 0 356 44
start 0 356 44
of 0 356 44
this 0 356 44
case, 0 356 44
law 0 356 44
enforcement 0 356 44
have 0 356 44
set 0 356 44
out 0 356 44
to 0 356 44
protect 0 356 44
Guyger 0 356 44
because 0 356 44
she 0 356 44
is 0 356 44
part 0 356 44
of 0 356 44
their 0 356 44
blue 0 356 44
line. 0 356 44

Amber 0 356 45
Guyger’s 0 356 45
home 0 356 45
was 0 356 45
never 0 356 45
searched 0 356 45
while 0 356 45
Jean’s 0 356 45
apartment 0 356 45
was 0 356 45
searched 0 356 45
that 0 356 45
night. 0 356 45

The 0 356 46
results 0 356 46
of 0 356 46

or 0 356 46
drugs 0 356 46
in 0 356 46
her 0 356 46
system 0 356 46
were 0 356 46
never 0 356 46
released, 0 356 46
yet 0 356 46
police 0 356 46
— 0 356 46
on 0 356 46
the 0 356 46
day 0 356 46
his 0 356 46
mother 0 356 46
buried 0 356 46
her 0 356 46
son 0 356 46
— 0 356 46

they 0 356 46
found 0 356 46
marijuana 0 356 46
in 0 356 46
his 0 356 46
house. 0 356 46

It’s 0 356 47
been 0 356 47
a 0 356 47
smear 0 356 47
campaign 0 356 47
from 0 356 47
the 0 356 47
beginning 0 356 47
and 0 356 47
it 0 356 47
is 0 356 47
this 0 356 47
way 0 356 47
by 0 356 47
design. 0 356 47

Amber 0 356 48
Guyger 0 356 48
took 0 356 48
an 0 356 48
innocent 1 356 48
person’s 0 356 48
life, 0 356 48
and 0 356 48
because 0 356 48
people 0 356 48
are 0 356 48
so 0 356 48
blinded 0 356 48
by 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
badge, 0 356 48
she 0 356 48
is 0 356 48
being 0 356 48
portrayed 0 356 48
as 0 356 48
the 0 356 48
victim. 0 356 48

To 0 356 49

who 0 356 49
attempt 0 356 49
to 0 356 49

there 0 356 49
is 0 356 49
no 0 356 49
bias 0 356 49
in 0 356 49
this 0 356 49
horrifically 1 356 49
flawed 0 356 49
system, 0 356 49
if 0 356 49
ever 0 356 49
there 0 356 49

a 0 356 49

meeting 0 361 19
and 0 361 19
was 0 361 19
surprised 0 361 19
by 0 361 19
the 0 361 19
Chief’s 0 361 19
comments. 0 361 19

“I 0 361 20
was 0 361 20
completely 0 361 20
mystified, 0 361 20
and 0 361 20
I 0 361 20
really 0 361 20
didn’t 0 361 20
understand 0 361 20
where 0 361 20
it 0 361 20
came 0 361 20
from 0 361 20
last 0 361 20
night. 0 361 20

It 0 361 21
seemed 0 361 21
like 0 361 21
Chief 1 361 21
Hall 1 361 21
might 1 361 21
not 1 361 21
have 1 361 21
been 1 361 21
well 1 361 21
informed 1 361 21
on 1 361 21
the 1 361 21
law,” 1 361 21
said 0 361 21
Moore. 0 361 21

WFAA 0 361 22
went 0 361 22
further 0 361 22
and 0 361 22
noted 0 361 22
that 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
“the 0 361 22
Dallas 0 361 22
Police 0 361 22
Department 0 361 22
general 0 361 22
orders 0 361 22
do 0 361 22
allow 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
chief 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
take 0 361 22
action, 0 361 22
saying, 0 361 22
‘The 0 361 22
Chief 0 361 22
of 0 361 22
Police 0 361 22
may 0 361 22
circumvent 0 361 22
all 0 361 22
formal 0 361 22
disciplinary 0 361 22
procedures 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
render 0 361 22
an 0 361 22
immediate 0 361 22
decision 0 361 22
when 0 361 22
it 0 361 22
deems 0 361 22
it 0 361 22
necessary 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
preserve 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
integrity 0 361 22
of 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
department.’” 0 361 22

Apparently, 0 361 23
this 0 361 23
“integrity” 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
not 0 361 23
worth 0 361 23
preserving 0 361 23
and 0 361 23
the 0 361 23
Dallas 0 361 23
police 0 361 23
are 0 361 23
going 0 361 23
out 0 361 23
of 0 361 23
their 0 361 23
way 0 361 23
to 0 361 23
keep 0 361 23
a 0 361 23
killer 1 361 23
cop 1 361 23
on 0 361 23
their 0 361 23
payroll. 0 361 23

As 0 361 24
WFAA 0 361 24
pointed 0 361 24
out, 0 361 24
lots 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
cops 0 361 24
across 0 361 24
the 0 361 24
state 0 361 24
who 0 361 24
have 0 361 24
been 0 361 24
under 0 361 24
criminal 0 361 24
investigation 0 361 24
have 0 361 24
been 0 361 24
fired 0 361 24
by 0 361 24
police 0 361 24
chiefs. 0 361 24

This 0 361 25
includes 0 361 25
cops 0 361 25
within 0 361 25
the 0 361 25
Dallas 0 361 25
police 0 361 25
department. 0 361 25

Amy 0 361 26
Wilburn, 0 361 26
a 0 361 26
former 0 361 26
Dallas 1 361 26
cop 1 361 26
shot 1 361 26
an 1 361 26
unarmed 1 361 26
teen 1 361 26
in 0 361 26
the 0 361 26
stomach 0 361 26
as 0 361 26
he 0 361 26
sat 0 361 26
down 0 361 26
with 0 361 26
his 0 361 26
hands 0 361 26
in 0 361 26
the 0 361 26
air 0 361 26
in 0 361 26
2013. 0 361 26

Days 0 361 27
later, 0 361 27
after 0 361 27
her 0 361 27
account 0 361 27
was 0 361 27
found 0 361 27
to 0 361 27
be 0 361 27
entirely 0 361 27
false, 0 361 27
she 0 361 27
was 0 361 27
fired 0 361 27
for 0 361 27
it. 0 361 27

Wilburn 0 361 28
became 0 361 28
the 0 361 28
first 0 361 28
cop 0 361 28
in 0 361 28
41 0 361 28
years 0 361 28
— 0 361 28
since 0 361 28
officer 1 361 28
Darrell 1 361 28
Cain 1 361 28
murdered 1 361 28
a 1 361 28
12-year-old 1 361 28
boy 1 361 28
in 0 361 28
the 0 361 28
back 0 361 28
of 0 361 28
his 0 361 28
squad 0 361 28
car 0 361 28
— 0 361 28
to 0 361 28
be 0 361 28
indicted 0 361 28
for 0 361 28
shooting 0 361 28
a 0 361 28
suspect. 0 361 28

Also 0 361 29
in 0 361 29
2013, 0 361 29
officer 1 361 29
Cardan 1 361 29
Spencer 1 361 29
shot 1 361 29
a 1 361 29
mentally 1 361 29
ill 1 361 29
man 1 361 29
in 0 361 29
his 0 361 29
driveway. 0 361 29

Days 0 361 30
later, 0 361 30
he 0 361 30
was 0 361 30
also 0 361 30
fired 0 361 30
after 0 361 30
surveillance 0 361 30
video 0 361 30
proved 0 361 30
he 0 361 30
was 0 361 30
lying 0 361 30
about 0 361 30
what 0 361 30
happened. 0 361 30

So 0 361 31
why 0 361 31
hasn’t 0 361 31
the 0 361 31
chief 0 361 31
fired 0 361 31
Gugyer, 0 361 31
who 0 361 31
has 0 361 31
actually 0 361 31
been 0 361 31
charged, 0 361 31
arrested, 0 361 31
and 0 361 31
admitted 0 361 31
to 0 361 31
killing 0 361 31
an 0 361 31
innocent 1 361 31
man? 0 361 31

Like 0 361 32
all 0 361 32
those 0 361 32
accused 0 361 32
of 0 361 32
a 0 361 32
crime, 0 361 32
Amber 0 361 32
Guyger 0 361 32
deserves 0 361 32
her 0 361 32
day 0 361 32
in 0 361 32
court. 0 361 32

However, 0 361 33
as 0 361 33
far 0 361 33
as 0 361 33
her 0 361 33
job 0 361 33
with 0 361 33
the 0 361 33
department 0 361 33
is 0 361 33
concerned, 0 361 33
she 0 361 33
has 0 361 33
already 0 361 33
proven 0 361 33
that 0 361 33
she 0 361 33
is 0 361 33
no 0 361 33
longer 0 361 33
fit 0 361 33
for 0 361 33
duty, 0 361 33
ever 0 361 33
again. 0 361 33

WFAA 0 361 34
asked 0 361 34
the 0 361 34
Dallas 0 361 34
Police 0 361 34
Department 0 361 34
for 0 361 34
the 0 361 34
laws 0 361 34
she 0 361 34
cited 0 361 34
claiming 0 361 34
that 0 361 34
she 0 361 34
can’t 0 361 34
fire 0 361 34
Guyger, 0 361 34
but 0 361 34
they 0 361 34
did 0 361 34
not 0 361 34
provide 0 361 34
them. 0 361 34

The 0 361 35
department 0 361 35
did 0 361 35
respond 0 361 35
about 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
general 0 361 35
order 0 361 35
mentioned 0 361 35
by 0 361 35
WFAA, 0 361 35
however, 0 361 35
saying, 0 361 35
“General 0 361 35
order 0 361 35
508 0 361 35
refers 0 361 35
to 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
Police 0 361 35
Chief’s 0 361 35
ability 0 361 35
to 0 361 35
circumvent 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
formal 0 361 35
disciplinary 0 361 35
procedures 0 361 35
not 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
investigative 0 361 35
process.” 0 361 35

Exactly 0 361 36
what 0 361 36
“investigative 0 361 36
process” 0 361 36
needs 0 361 36
to 0 361 36
happen 0 361 36
before 0 361 36
they 0 361 36
can 0 361 36
fire 0 361 36
her 0 361 36
remains 0 361 36
unclear 0 361 36
as 0 361 36
this 0 361 36
public 0 361 36
servant 0 361 36
admitted 0 361 36
to 0 361 36
killing 0 361 36
an 0 361 36
innocent 1 361 36
man 0 361 36
in 0 361 36
his 0 361 36
own 0 361 36
home. 0 361 36

At 0 361 37
the 0 361 37
very 0 361 37
least, 0 361 37
she 0 361 37
should 0 361 37
be 0 361 37
fired 0 361 37
for 0 361 37
this. 0 361 37

But 0 361 38
then 0 361 38
again, 0 361 38
as 0 361 38
we’ve 0 361 38
reported 0 361 38
already 0 361 38
this 0 361 38
week, 0 361 38
Amber 0 361 38
Guyger 0 361 38
is 0 361 38
subject 0 361 38
to 0 361 38
a 0 361 38
different 0 361 38

rules 0 361 38
than 0 361 38
common 0 361 38

which 0 361 38
apparently 0 361 38
includes 0 361 38
keeping 0 361 38
a 0 361 38
paycheck 0 361 38
after 0 361 38
admitting 0 361 38

News' 0 362 31
Martha 0 362 31
MacCallum 0 362 31
and 0 362 31
said 0 362 31
"you 0 362 31
have 0 362 31
to 0 362 31
have 0 362 31
some 0 362 31
evidence 0 362 31
before 0 362 31
you 0 362 31
destroy 0 362 31
a 0 362 31
man's 0 362 31
life." 0 362 31

Shapiro's 0 362 32
comments 0 362 32
can 0 362 32
be 0 362 32
heard 0 362 32
in 0 362 32
the 0 362 32
video 0 362 32
below. 0 362 32

Jeanine 0 362 33
Pirro 0 362 33
spoke 0 362 33
to 0 362 33
Hannity 0 362 33
on 0 362 33
Thursday 0 362 33
night 0 362 33
and 0 362 33
asked, 0 362 33
"Since 0 362 33
when 0 362 33
does 0 362 33
truth 0 362 33
and 0 362 33
justice 0 362 33
or 0 362 33
guilt 0 362 33
and 0 362 33
innocence 0 362 33
depend 0 362 33
on 0 362 33
your 0 362 33
political 0 362 33
party. 0 362 33

I 1 362 34
fear 1 362 34
for 1 362 34
this 1 362 34
nation 1 362 34
when 1 362 34
this 1 362 34
is 1 362 34
now 1 362 34
the 1 362 34
standard. 1 362 34

You 1 362 35
believe 1 362 35
any 1 362 35
woman 1 362 35
who 1 362 35
goes 1 362 35
against 1 362 35
a 1 362 35
Republican 1 362 35
and 1 362 35
you 1 362 35
don't 1 362 35
believe 1 362 35
any 1 362 35
woman 1 362 35
who 1 362 35
goes 1 362 35
against 1 362 35
a 1 362 35
Democrat." 1 362 35

She 0 362 36
continued. 0 362 36

"I 0 362 37
worry 1 362 37
about 1 362 37
this 1 362 37
country. 1 362 37

I 0 362 38
don't 0 362 38
want 0 362 38
these 0 362 38
people 0 362 38
to 0 362 38
sit 0 362 38
on 0 362 38
juries. 0 362 38

It's 0 362 39
no 0 362 39
longer 0 362 39
about 0 362 39
truth 0 362 39
and 0 362 39
justice. 0 362 39

It's 0 362 40
about 0 362 40
politics." 0 362 40

Hannity 0 362 41
asks, 0 362 41
"Why 0 362 41
are 0 362 41
people 0 362 41
willing 0 362 41
to 0 362 41
throw 0 362 41
out 0 362 41
due 0 362 41
process, 0 362 41
equal 0 362 41
justice 0 362 41
under 0 362 41
the 0 362 41
law 0 362 41
and 0 362 41
the 0 362 41
presumption 0 362 41
of 0 362 41
innocence?" 0 362 41

Gregg 0 362 42
Jarrett 0 362 42
says 0 362 42
it's 0 362 42
"because 0 362 42
they're 1 362 42
zealous 1 362 42
to 0 362 42
the 0 362 42
point 0 362 42
where 0 362 42
they've 0 362 42
lost 0 362 42
their 0 362 42
common 0 362 42
sense." 0 362 42

Their 0 362 43
commentary 0 362 43
on 0 362 43
the 0 362 43
video 0 362 43
below 0 362 43
is 0 362 43
interesting. 0 362 43

Sen. 0 362 44
Charles 0 362 44
Grassley 0 362 44
(R-IA) 0 362 44
is 0 362 44
to 0 362 44
be 0 362 44
commended 0 362 44
on 0 362 44
his 0 362 44
handling 0 362 44
of 0 362 44
the 0 362 44
situation. 0 362 44

In 0 362 45
the 0 362 45
spirit 0 362 45
of 0 362 45
compromise, 0 362 45
he 0 362 45
called 0 362 45
off 0 362 45
the 0 362 45
Senate 0 362 45
committee 0 362 45
vote 0 362 45
that 0 362 45
had 0 362 45
been 0 362 45
on 0 362 45
the 0 362 45
calendar 0 362 45
for 0 362 45
Thursday 0 362 45
and 0 362 45
scheduled 0 362 45
a 0 362 45
hearing 0 362 45
for 0 362 45
next 0 362 45
Monday 0 362 45
so 0 362 45
that 0 362 45
both 0 362 45
Christine 0 362 45
Ford 0 362 45
and 0 362 45
Brett 0 362 45
Kavanaugh 0 362 45
could 0 362 45
state 0 362 45
their 0 362 45
cases. 0 362 45

Kavanaugh 0 362 46
immediately 0 362 46
responded 0 362 46
to 0 362 46
Grassley. 0 362 46

For 0 362 47
36 0 362 47
hours, 0 362 47
there 0 362 47
was 0 362 47
silence 0 362 47
from 0 362 47
the 0 362 47
Ford 0 362 47
camp. 0 362 47

Then, 0 362 48
their 0 362 48
demands 0 362 48
began. 0 362 48

First, 0 362 49
it 0 362 49
was 0 362 49
reported 0 362 49
that 0 362 49
Ford 0 362 49
would 0 362 49
answer 0 362 49
questions, 0 362 49
but 0 362 49
only 0 362 49
at 0 362 49
a 0 362 49
closed 0 362 49
hearing 0 362 49
and 0 362 49
only 0 362 49
after 0 362 49
an 0 362 49
FBI 0 362 49
investigation 0 362 49
had 0 362 49
been 0 362 49
completed. 0 362 49

Republicans 0 362 50
felt 0 362 50
that 0 362 50
the 0 362 50
request 0 362 50
for 0 362 50
a 0 362 50
closed 0 362 50
hearing 0 362 50
was 0 362 50
reasonable, 0 362 50
but 0 362 50
the 0 362 50
demand 0 362 50
for 0 362 50
a 0 362 50
new 0 362 50
FBI 0 362 50
investigation 0 362 50
was 0 362 50
not. 0 362 50

The 0 362 51
FBI 0 362 51
investigates 0 362 51
federal 0 362 51
crimes 0 362 51
and/or 0 362 51
national 0 362 51
security 0 362 51
issues. 0 362 51

When 0 362 52
the 0 362 52
FBI 0 362 52
received 0 362 52
Dianne 0 362 52
Feinstein’s 0 362 52
letter 0 362 52
last 0 362 52
week, 0 362 52
they 0 362 52
forwarded 0 362 52
it 0 362 52
to 0 362 52
the 0 362 52
White 0 362 52
House 0 362 52
to 0 362 52
place 0 362 52
in 0 362 52
Kavanaugh’s 0 362 52
background 0 362 52
check 0 362 52
file. 0 362 52

(Note: 0 362 53
The 0 362 53
FBI 0 362 53
has 0 362 53
already 0 362 53
conducted 0 362 53
six 0 362 53
background 0 362 53
checks 0 362 53
on 0 362 53
Kavanaugh, 0 362 53
the 0 362 53
most 0 362 53
recent 0 362 53
one 0 362 53
was 0 362 53
done 0 362 53
this 0 362 53
summer.) 0 362 53

It 0 362 54
was 0 362 54
announced 0 362 54
later 0 362 54
that 0 362 54
Sen. 0 362 54
Grassley 0 362 54
would 0 362 54
not 0 362 54
change 0 362 54
the 0 362 54
date 0 362 54
of 0 362 54
the 0 362 54
hearing 0 362 54
set 0 362 54
for 0 362 54
Monday. 0 362 54

Even 0 362 55
Senators 0 362 55
Jeff 0 362 55
Flake, 0 362 55
Bob 0 362 55
Corker 0 362 55
and 0 362 55
Lindsey 0 362 55
Graham, 0 362 55
who 0 362 55
have 0 362 55
all 0 362 55
said 0 362 55
Ford 0 362 55
needs 0 362 55
to 0 362 55
be 0 362 55
heard, 0 362 55
have 0 362 55
indicated 0 362 55
that 0 362 55
if 0 362 55
she 0 362 55
does 0 362 55
not 0 362 55
show 0 362 55
up 0 362 55
for 0 362 55
Monday's 0 362 55
hearing, 0 362 55
they 0 362 55
will 0 362 55
schedule 0 362 55
a 0 362 55
vote 0 362 55
on 0 362 55
Kavanaugh's 0 362 55
confirmation. 0 362 55

On 0 362 56
Thursday 0 362 56
afternoon, 0 362 56
Ford's 0 362 56
highly 1 362 56
partisan, 1 362 56
activist 1 362 56
attorney 1 362 56
emailed 0 362 56
Grassley 0 362 56
saying, 0 362 56
although 0 362 56
her 0 362 56
client 0 362 56
strongly 0 362 56
prefers 0 362 56
that 0 362 56
an 0 362 56
investigation 0 362 56
take 0 362 56
place 0 362 56
beforehand, 0 362 56
Ford 0 362 56
will 0 362 56
testify 0 362 56
next 0 362 56
week, 0 362 56
but 0 362 56
she 0 362 56
cannot 0 362 56
do 0 362 56
so 0 362 56
on 0 362 56
Monday. 0 362 56

And 0 362 57
she 0 362 57
will 0 362 57
only 0 362 57
be 0 362 57
questioned 0 362 57
by 0 362 57
members 0 362 57
of 0 362 57
the 0 362 57
Senate 0 362 57
panel, 0 362 57
not 0 362 57
outside 0 362 57
lawyers. 0 362 57

Why 1 362 58
not 1 362 58
Monday? 1 362 58

Does 1 362 59
she 1 362 59
have 1 362 59
an 1 362 59
important 1 362 59
dentist 1 362 59
appointment 1 362 59
she 1 362 59
can't 1 362 59
get 1 362 59
out 1 362 59
of? 1 362 59

In 0 362 60
order 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
avoid 0 362 60
the 0 362 60
criticism 0 362 60
that 0 362 60
will 0 362 60
no 0 362 60
doubt 0 362 60
come 0 362 60
anyway, 0 362 60
the 0 362 60
Republicans 0 362 60
on 0 362 60
the 0 362 60
Senate 0 362 60
Judicial 0 362 60
committee 0 362 60
have 0 362 60
tried 0 362 60
very 0 362 60
hard 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
oblige 0 362 60
Ford's 0 362 60
requests, 0 362 60
even 0 362 60
offering 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
go 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
California 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
hear 0 362 60
her 0 362 60
testimony. 0 362 60

She 0 362 61
and 0 362 61
her 0 362 61
attorneys 0 362 61
feel 0 362 61
that 0 362 61
they 0 362 61
are 0 362 61
in 0 362 61
the 0 362 61
driver's 0 362 61
seat 0 362 61
and 0 362 61
thus, 0 362 61
can 0 362 61
call 0 362 61
all 0 362 61
the 0 362 61
shots. 0 362 61

Democrats 1 362 62
want 1 362 62
to 1 362 62
delay 1 362 62
this 1 362 62
vote 1 362 62
until 1 362 62
after 1 362 62
the 1 362 62
midterms 1 362 62
because 1 362 62
they 1 362 62
believe 1 362 62
they 1 362 62
have 1 362 62
a 1 362 62
chance 1 362 62
to 1 362 62
retake 1 362 62
the 1 362 62
Senate 1 362 62
as 1 362 62
well 1 362 62
as 1 362 62
the 1 362 62
House. 1 362 62

Rush 0 362 63
Limbaugh 0 362 63
points 0 362 63
out 0 362 63
that 0 362 63
the 0 362 63
Senate 0 362 63
has 0 362 63
bent 1 362 63
over 1 362 63
backwards 1 362 63
to 0 362 63
accommodate 0 362 63
the 0 362 63
accuser. 0 362 63

"I 0 362 64
don’t 1 362 64
care 1 362 64
who 1 362 64
you 1 362 64

the 0 362 64
parameters 0 362 64
of 0 362 64
an 0 362 64
investigation. 0 362 64

The 0 362 65

In 1 362 66
no 1 362 66

In 0 362 67
addition 0 362 67
to 0 362 67
the 0 362 67
political 0 362 67
reasons 0 362 67
for 0 362 67
the 0 362 67
delay 0 362 67
requests, 0 362 67
it 0 362 67
appears 0 362 67
as 0 362 67
if 0 362 67
this 0 362 67
woman 0 362 67
is 0 362 67
reluctant 0 362 67
to 0 362 67
testify 0 362 67
under 0 362 67
oath, 0 362 67
possibly 0 362 67
because 0 362 67
she 0 362 67
doesn’t 0 362 67
want 0 362 67
to 0 362 67
perjure 0 362 67
herself. 0 362 67

Maybe 0 362 68
she 0 362 68
realizes 0 362 68
the 0 362 68
magnitude 0 362 68
of 0 362 68
what 0 362 68
her 0 362 68
accusations 0 362 68
have 0 362 68
unleashed. 0 362 68

Either 0 362 69
this 0 362 69

not 0 362 69
happen 0 362 69
at 0 362 69
all 0 362 69

Kavanaugh 0 362 70
may 0 362 70
have 0 362 70
made 0 362 70
a 0 362 70
pass 0 362 70
at 0 362 70
her 0 362 70

that 0 362 71

it. 0 362 71

Even 0 362 72
she 0 362 72
admits, 0 362 72
they 0 362 72
did 0 362 72
not 0 362 72
have 0 362 72
sex, 0 362 72
nor 0 362 72
was 0 362 72
this 0 362 72
a 0 362 72

The 0 362 73
perception 0 362 73
of 0 362 73

by 0 362 73
a 0 362 73
15-year-old 0 362 73
girl 0 362 73
may 0 362 73
differ 0 362 73
significantly 0 362 73
from 0 362 73
reality. 0 362 73

And 0 362 74
36 0 362 74

another. 0 362 74

What 1 362 75
is 1 362 75

the 1 362 75
Brett 1 362 75

process 1 362 75
should 1 362 75
concern 1 362 75
every 1 362 75
American. 1 362 75

Whatever 0 362 76
happened 0 362 76
or 0 362 76
did 0 362 76
not 0 362 76
happen, 0 362 76
it's 0 362 76
difficult 0 362 76
to 0 362 76
feel 0 362 76
sorry 0 362 76
for 0 362 76
someone 0 362 76
who 0 362 76
comes 0 362 76
forward 0 362 76
at 0 362 76
such 0 362 76

politically 0 362 76
opportune 0 362 76
moment. 0 362 76

There 0 362 77
was 0 362 77
ample 0 362 77

inflict 1 362 77
maximum 1 362 77
political 1 362 77

The 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
recounted 0 365 5
a 0 365 5
claim 0 365 5
by 0 365 5
Deborah 0 365 5
Ramirez, 0 365 5
a 0 365 5
Yale 0 365 5

of 0 365 5
Brett 0 365 5
Kavanaugh’s, 0 365 5
concerning 0 365 5
“a 0 365 5
dormitory 0 365 5
party 0 365 5
gone 0 365 5
awry.” 0 365 5
As 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
acknowledged, 0 365 5
however, 0 365 5
“her 0 365 5
memories 0 365 5
contained 0 365 5
gaps 0 365 5
because 0 365 5
she 0 365 5
had 0 365 5
been 0 365 5
drinking 0 365 5
at 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
time 0 365 5
of 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
alleged 0 365 5
incident.” 0 365 5
The 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
goes 0 365 5
on 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
say 0 365 5
that 0 365 5
in 0 365 5
her 0 365 5
initial 0 365 5
conversations 0 365 5
with 0 365 5
The 0 365 5
New 0 365 5
Yorker, 0 365 5
Ms. 0 365 5
Ramirez 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
“reluctant 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
characterize 0 365 5
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 5
role 0 365 5
in 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
alleged 0 365 5
incident 0 365 5
with 0 365 5
certainty.” 0 365 5
It 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
only 0 365 5
after 0 365 5
“six 0 365 5
days 0 365 5

her 0 365 5
attorney” 0 365 5
that 0 365 5
Ms. 0 365 5
Ramirez 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
suddenly 0 365 5
able 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
pinpoint 0 365 5
Judge 0 365 5
Kavanaugh 0 365 5
as 0 365 5
having 0 365 5
committed 0 365 5
an 0 365 5
unsavory 0 365 5
act, 0 365 5
even 0 365 5
though 0 365 5
she 0 365 5
admitted 0 365 5
being 0 365 5
“foggy” 0 365 5
at 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
time. 0 365 5

The 0 365 6
New 0 365 6
Yorker 0 365 6
article 0 365 6
also 0 365 6
noted 0 365 6
that 0 365 6
the 0 365 6
magazine 0 365 6
“has 0 365 6
not 0 365 6
confirmed 0 365 6

that 0 365 6

Meanwhile, 0 365 7

to 0 365 7

"gang 0 365 7

Haters 1 365 8
of 1 365 8
Judge 1 365 8
Kavanaugh 1 365 8
are 0 365 8
turning 0 365 8
the 0 365 8
process 0 365 8
of 0 365 8

of 0 365 8

into 0 365 8
something 0 365 8
worse 1 365 8
than 1 365 8
a 1 365 8

His 0 365 9
opponents 0 365 9
in 0 365 9
the 0 365 9

the 0 365 12
committee 0 365 12
to 0 365 12

Mark 0 365 12
Judge, 0 365 12
who 0 365 12
Ms. 0 365 12
Ford 0 365 12
reportedly 0 365 12
claims 0 365 12
was 0 365 12
involved 0 365 12
in 0 365 12
the 0 365 12
alleged 0 365 12
incident, 0 365 12
as 0 365 12
well 0 365 12
as 0 365 12
“who 0 365 12
on 0 365 12
the 0 365 12
Majority 0 365 12
side 0 365 12

whether 0 365 12
senators 0 365 12
or 0 365 12

attorneys." 0 365 12

A 0 365 13
week 0 365 13
has 0 365 13
already 0 365 13
gone 0 365 13
by 0 365 13
since 0 365 13
Ms. 0 365 13
Ford 0 365 13
went 0 365 13
public 0 365 13
with 0 365 13
her 0 365 13
story 0 365 13
in 0 365 13
an 0 365 13
interview 0 365 13
with 0 365 13
the 0 365 13
Washington 0 365 13
Post 0 365 13
while 0 365 13
Ms. 0 365 13
Ford 0 365 13
and 0 365 13
her 0 365 13
attorneys 0 365 13
stalled 0 365 13
for 0 365 13
time. 0 365 13

They 0 365 14
raised 0 365 14
one 0 365 14
procedural 0 365 14
issue 0 365 14
after 0 365 14
another 0 365 14
while 0 365 14
claiming 0 365 14
that 0 365 14
the 0 365 14
committee 0 365 14
majority 0 365 14
was 0 365 14
“bullying” 0 365 14
Ms. 0 365 14
Ford. 0 365 14

Senate 0 365 15
Judiciary 0 365 15
Committee 0 365 15
Chairman 0 365 15
Charles 0 365 15
Grassley 0 365 15
(R-I) 0 365 15
has 0 365 15
bent 1 365 15
over 1 365 15
backwards 1 365 15
to 0 365 15
accommodate 0 365 15
Ms. 0 365 15
Ford’s 0 365 15
preferred 0 365 15
scheduling 0 365 15
for 0 365 15
her 0 365 15
appearance. 0 365 15

He 0 365 16
extended 0 365 16
the 0 365 16
deadline 0 365 16
several 0 365 16
times 0 365 16
for 0 365 16
her 0 365 16
to 0 365 16
come 0 365 16
to 0 365 16
a 0 365 16
decision 0 365 16
on 0 365 16
whether 0 365 16
to 0 365 16
testify 0 365 16
at 0 365 16
all. 0 365 16

He 0 365 17
had 0 365 17
offered 0 365 17
various 0 365 17
options 0 365 17
for 0 365 17
her 0 365 17
to 0 365 17
testify 0 365 17
publicly 0 365 17
or 0 365 17
privately 0 365 17
or 0 365 17
to 0 365 17
be 0 365 17
interviewed 0 365 17
by 0 365 17
committee 0 365 17
staff 0 365 17
in 0 365 17
her 0 365 17
home 0 365 17
state 0 365 17
of 0 365 17
California, 0 365 17
whichever 0 365 17
setting 0 365 17
would 0 365 17
make 0 365 17
her 0 365 17
more 0 365 17
comfortable. 0 365 17

However, 0 365 18
in 0 365 18
Senator 0 365 18
Grassley’s 0 365 18
e-mail 0 365 18
thanking 0 365 18
Ms. 0 365 18
Ford 0 365 18
for 0 365 18
finally 0 365 18
agreeing 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
a 0 365 18
time 0 365 18
certain 0 365 18
for 0 365 18
her 0 365 18
testimony, 0 365 18
Senator 0 365 18
Grassley 0 365 18
correctly 0 365 18
reminded 0 365 18
her 0 365 18
attorneys 0 365 18
that 0 365 18
“the 0 365 18
committee 0 365 18
determines 0 365 18
which 0 365 18
witnesses 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
call, 0 365 18
how 0 365 18
many 0 365 18
witnesses 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
call, 0 365 18
and 0 365 18
what 0 365 18
order 0 365 18
to 0 365 18
call 0 365 18
them 0 365 18
and 0 365 18
who 0 365 18
will 0 365 18
question 0 365 18
them. 0 365 18

These 0 365 19
are 0 365 19
nonnegotiable.” 0 365 19

While 0 365 20
the 0 365 20
negotiations 0 365 20
with 0 365 20
Ms. 0 365 20
Ford’s 0 365 20
attorneys 0 365 20
for 0 365 20
her 0 365 20
testimony 0 365 20
were 0 365 20
underway, 0 365 20
Democrats 0 365 20
were 0 365 20
sitting 0 365 20
on 0 365 20
the 0 365 20
latest 0 365 20
allegations, 0 365 20
ready 1 365 20
to 1 365 20
pounce 1 365 20
as 0 365 20
soon 0 365 20
as 0 365 20
Ms. 0 365 20
Ford’s 0 365 20
accusation 0 365 20
was 0 365 20
about 0 365 20
to 0 365 20
be 0 365 20
heard. 0 365 20

Some 0 365 21
Democrats 0 365 21
are 0 365 21
already 0 365 21
using 0 365 21
the 0 365 21
Ramirez 0 365 21
episode 0 365 21
to 0 365 21
push 0 365 21
anew 0 365 21
for 0 365 21
a 0 365 21
fresh 0 365 21
FBI 0 365 21
investigation 0 365 21
and 0 365 21
to 0 365 21
postpone 0 365 21
Thursday’s 0 365 21
scheduled 0 365 21
hearing. 0 365 21

Ideally, 0 365 22
if 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
Democrats 0 365 22
cannot 0 365 22
apply 0 365 22
enough 0 365 22
pressure 0 365 22
to 0 365 22
force 0 365 22
a 0 365 22
withdrawal 0 365 22
of 0 365 22
Judge 0 365 22
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 22
nomination 0 365 22
through 0 365 22
their 0 365 22
relentless 0 365 22
campaign 0 365 22
of 0 365 22
character 1 365 22
assassination, 1 365 22
they 0 365 22
want 0 365 22
to 0 365 22
push 0 365 22
any 0 365 22
Senate 0 365 22
votes 0 365 22
until 0 365 22
after 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
midterm 0 365 22
elections 0 365 22
at 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
earliest. 0 365 22

Then 0 365 23
they 0 365 23
will 0 365 23
claim 0 365 23
that 0 365 23
the 0 365 23
newly 0 365 23
elected 0 365 23
senators 0 365 23
should 0 365 23
be 0 365 23
involved 0 365 23
in 0 365 23
the 0 365 23
confirmation 0 365 23
decision. 0 365 23

In 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
meantime, 0 365 24
Judge 0 365 24
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 24
adversaries 0 365 24
in 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
Senate, 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
mainstream 0 365 24
media 0 365 24
and 0 365 24
progressive 0 365 24
circles 0 365 24
continue 1 365 24
to 1 365 24
bludgeon 1 365 24
Judge 0 365 24
Kavanaugh 0 365 24
in 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
court 0 365 24
of 0 365 24
public 0 365 24
opinion. 0 365 24

All 0 365 25
of 0 365 25
their 0 365 25
stratagems 0 365 25
are 0 365 25
an 0 365 25
obvious 0 365 25
attempt 0 365 25
to 0 365 25
buy 0 365 25
time 0 365 25
in 0 365 25
order 0 365 25
to 0 365 25
persuade 0 365 25
any 0 365 25
wavering 0 365 25
senators 0 365 25
that 0 365 25
Judge 0 365 25
Kavanaugh 0 365 25
is 0 365 25
too 0 365 25
tainted 0 365 25
by 0 365 25
sexual 0 365 25
assault 0 365 25
charges 0 365 25
– 0 365 25
whether 0 365 25
proven 0 365 25
or 0 365 25
not 0 365 25
- 0 365 25
to 0 365 25
sit 0 365 25
on 0 365 25
the 0 365 25
Supreme 0 365 25
Court. 0 365 25

Proof 0 365 26
does 0 365 26
not 0 365 26
matter 0 365 26
to 0 365 26
those 0 365 26
wanting 0 365 26
to 0 365 26
bring 0 365 26
Judge 0 365 26
Kavanaugh 0 365 26
down 0 365 26
at 0 365 26
any 0 365 26
cost. 0 365 26

Regarding 0 365 27
Ms. 0 365 27
Ford’s 0 365 27
accusation, 0 365 27
they 0 365 27
know 0 365 27
that 0 365 27
the 0 365 27
proof 0 365 27
so 0 365 27
far 0 365 27
is 0 365 27
non-existent, 0 365 27
aside 0 365 27
from 0 365 27
Ms. 0 365 27
Ford’s 0 365 27
own 0 365 27
assertions 0 365 27
contained 0 365 27
in 0 365 27
her 0 365 27
confidential 0 365 27
letter 0 365 27
given 0 365 27
to 0 365 27
Senator 0 365 27
Dianne 0 365 27
Feinstein, 0 365 27
the 0 365 27
ranking 0 365 27
member 0 365 27
of 0 365 27
the 0 365 27
Judiciary 0 365 27
Committee, 0 365 27
last 0 365 27
July, 0 365 27
and 0 365 27
in 0 365 27
her 0 365 27
Washington 0 365 27
Post 0 365 27
interview. 0 365 27

While 0 365 28
a 0 365 28
redacted 0 365 28
version 0 365 28
of 0 365 28
Ms. 0 365 28
Ford’s 0 365 28
letter 0 365 28
has 0 365 28
been 0 365 28
published, 0 365 28
Senator 0 365 28
Feinstein 0 365 28
has 0 365 28
refused 0 365 28
to 0 365 28
date 0 365 28
to 0 365 28
give 0 365 28
even 0 365 28
Senator 0 365 28
Grassley 0 365 28
a 0 365 28
copy 0 365 28
of 0 365 28
the 0 365 28
completely 0 365 28
unredacted 0 365 28
version. 0 365 28

The 0 365 29
FBI 0 365 29
has 0 365 29
already 0 365 29
conducted 0 365 29
6 0 365 29
background 0 365 29
checks, 0 365 29
no 0 365 29
federal 0 365 29
crime 0 365 29
is 0 365 29
alleged, 0 365 29
and 0 365 29
there 0 365 29
is 0 365 29
no 0 365 29
forensic 0 365 29
evidence 0 365 29
to 0 365 29
investigate 0 365 29
after 0 365 29
30 0 365 29
years 0 365 29
at 0 365 29
a 0 365 29
site 0 365 29
that 0 365 29
Ms. 0 365 29
Ford 0 365 29
cannot 0 365 29
even 0 365 29
identify. 0 365 29

What 1 365 30
we 1 365 30
do 1 365 30
know 1 365 30
so 1 365 30
far 1 365 30
tends 1 365 30
to 1 365 30
undercut 1 365 30
the 1 365 30
credibility 1 365 30
of 1 365 30
Ms. 1 365 30
Ford’s 1 365 30
accusation. 1 365 30

Ms. 0 365 31
Ford 0 365 31
cannot 0 365 31
corroborate 0 365 31
her 0 365 31
decades-old 0 365 31
charge 0 365 31
of 0 365 31
sexual 0 365 31
assault 0 365 31
against 0 365 31
Judge 0 365 31
Kavanaugh. 0 365 31

Whatever 1 365 32
corroboration 1 365 32
Ms. 1 365 32
Ford 1 365 32
was 1 365 32
hoping 1 365 32
for 1 365 32
from 1 365 32
“witnesses” 1 365 32
she 1 365 32
claimed 1 365 32
were 1 365 32
at 1 365 32
the 1 365 32
alleged 1 365 32
party 1 365 32
is 1 365 32
non-existent. 1 365 32

The 0 365 33
individuals 0 365 33
she 0 365 33
reportedly 0 365 33
named 0 365 33
in 0 365 33
her 0 365 33
unredacted 0 365 33
confidential 0 365 33
letter 0 365 33
given 0 365 33
to 0 365 33
Senator 0 365 33
Feinstein 0 365 33
have 0 365 33
either 0 365 33
denied 0 365 33
being 0 365 33
at 0 365 33
such 0 365 33
a 0 365 33
party 0 365 33
or 0 365 33
do 0 365 33
not 0 365 33
recollect 0 365 33
what 0 365 33
Ms. 0 365 33
Ford 0 365 33
has 0 365 33
alleged. 0 365 33

Moreover, 0 365 34
by 0 365 34
her 0 365 34
own 0 365 34
admission 0 365 34
to 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
Washington 0 365 34
Post, 0 365 34
Ms. 0 365 34
Ford 0 365 34
“said 0 365 34
she 0 365 34
does 0 365 34
not 0 365 34
remember 0 365 34
some 0 365 34
key 0 365 34
details 0 365 34
of 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
incident.” 0 365 34
She 0 365 34
does 0 365 34
not 0 365 34
remember, 0 365 34
for 0 365 34
example, 0 365 34
where 0 365 34
it 0 365 34
happened, 0 365 34
how 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
party 0 365 34
came 0 365 34
together 0 365 34
in 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
first 0 365 34
place, 0 365 34
or 0 365 34
how 0 365 34
she 0 365 34
got 0 365 34
home 0 365 34
after 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
alleged 0 365 34
incident. 0 365 34

She 0 365 35
believes 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
alleged 0 365 35
incident 0 365 35
occurred 0 365 35
during 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
summer 0 365 35
of 0 365 35
1982, 0 365 35
but 0 365 35
reportedly 0 365 35
could 0 365 35
not 0 365 35
be 0 365 35
more 0 365 35
precise 0 365 35
on 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
day 0 365 35
or 0 365 35
even 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
month 0 365 35
of 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
party. 0 365 35

Afraid 0 365 36
that 0 365 36
Ms. 0 365 36
Ford’s 0 365 36
sexual 0 365 36
assault 0 365 36
allegation 0 365 36
could 0 365 36
be 0 365 36
readily 0 365 36
challenged 0 365 36
and 0 365 36
anxious 0 365 36
to 0 365 36
establish 0 365 36
some 0 365 36
sort 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
pattern 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
sexual 0 365 36
misconduct 0 365 36
beyond 0 365 36
this 0 365 36
single 0 365 36
alleged 0 365 36
incident, 0 365 36
the 1 365 36
Kavanaugh 1 365 36
haters 1 365 36
have 0 365 36
latched 0 365 36
onto 0 365 36
Ms. 0 365 36
Ramirez’s 0 365 36
story. 0 365 36

The 0 365 37
New 0 365 37
York 0 365 37
Times 0 365 37
published 0 365 37
an 0 365 37
op-ed 0 365 37
column 0 365 37
last 0 365 37
week 0 365 37
by 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
psychiatrist, 0 365 37
Richard 0 365 37
A. 0 365 37
Friedman, 0 365 37
who 0 365 37
cited 0 365 37
neurological 0 365 37
science 0 365 37
to 0 365 37
conclude 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
Ms. 0 365 37
Ford’s 0 365 37
claim 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
she 0 365 37
has 0 365 37
“a 0 365 37
vivid 0 365 37
memory 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
an 0 365 37
attack 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
took 0 365 37
place 0 365 37
when 0 365 37
she 0 365 37
was 0 365 37
15” 0 365 37
is 0 365 37
“credible.” 0 365 37
The 0 365 37
reason, 0 365 37
he 0 365 37
wrote, 0 365 37
is 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
“memories 0 365 37
formed 0 365 37
under 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
influence 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
intense 0 365 37
emotion 0 365 37
— 0 365 37
such 0 365 37
as 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
feelings 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
accompany 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
sexual 0 365 37
assault 0 365 37
— 0 365 37
are 0 365 37
indelible 0 365 37
in 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
way 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
memories 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
routine 0 365 37
day 0 365 37
are 0 365 37
not.” 0 365 37
The 1 365 37
only 1 365 37
problem 1 365 37
with 1 365 37
Dr. 1 365 37
Friedman’s 1 365 37
thesis 1 365 37
is 1 365 37
that 1 365 37
Ms. 1 365 37
Ford 1 365 37
has 1 365 37
apparently 1 365 37
forgotten 1 365 37
such 1 365 37
key 1 365 37
details 1 365 37
surrounding 1 365 37
the 1 365 37
alleged 1 365 37
sexual 1 365 37
assault 1 365 37
as 1 365 37
when 1 365 37
and 1 365 37
where 1 365 37
it 1 365 37
happened 1 365 37
and 1 365 37
how 1 365 37
she 1 365 37
got 1 365 37
home. 1 365 37

Moreover, 0 365 38
when 0 365 38
Ms. 0 365 38
Ford 0 365 38
finally 0 365 38
told 0 365 38
someone 0 365 38
about 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
incident 0 365 38
in 0 365 38
any 0 365 38
detail 0 365 38
some 0 365 38
30 0 365 38
years 0 365 38
later 0 365 38
in 0 365 38
2012, 0 365 38
during 0 365 38
a 0 365 38
couples 0 365 38
therapy 0 365 38
session 0 365 38
with 0 365 38
her 0 365 38
husband, 0 365 38
she 0 365 38
did 0 365 38
not 0 365 38
name 0 365 38
Judge 0 365 38
Kavanaugh 0 365 38
specifically, 0 365 38
according 0 365 38
to 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
therapist’s 0 365 38
notes 0 365 38
that 0 365 38
Ms. 0 365 38
Ford 0 365 38
had 0 365 38
provided 0 365 38
to 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
Washington 0 365 38
Post 0 365 38
in 0 365 38
connection 0 365 38
with 0 365 38
her 0 365 38
interview. 0 365 38

The 0 365 39
Washington 0 365 39
Post 0 365 39
reported 0 365 39
that 0 365 39
the 0 365 39
therapist’s 0 365 39
notes 0 365 39
it 0 365 39
reviewed 0 365 39
“do 0 365 39
not 0 365 39
mention 0 365 39
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 39
name 0 365 39
but 0 365 39
say 0 365 39
she 0 365 39
reported 0 365 39
that 0 365 39
she 0 365 39
was 0 365 39

by 0 365 39
students 0 365 39

went 0 365 39
on 0 365 39
to 0 365 39
become 0 365 39
‘highly 0 365 39
respected 0 365 39

Ms. 0 365 40
Ramirez’s 0 365 40
story 0 365 40
is 0 365 40
even 0 365 40
less 0 365 40
credible. 0 365 40

It 0 365 41
took 0 365 41
an 0 365 41
attorney 0 365 41
and 0 365 41
six 0 365 41
days 0 365 41
of 0 365 41
very 0 365 41
belated 0 365 41
reflection 0 365 41
to 0 365 41
help 0 365 41
revive 0 365 41
her 0 365 41
memory 0 365 41
of 0 365 41
an 0 365 41
incident 0 365 41
she 0 365 41
claimed 0 365 41
happened 0 365 41
while 0 365 41
she 0 365 41
herself 0 365 41
was 0 365 41
very 0 365 41
drunk. 0 365 41

Senator 0 365 42
Mazie 0 365 42
Hirono 0 365 42
(D-Hawaii), 0 365 42
one 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
fiercest 0 365 42
critics 0 365 42
who 0 365 42
told 0 365 42
men 0 365 42
to 0 365 42
“shut 0 365 42
up” 0 365 42
regarding 0 365 42
Ms. 0 365 42
Ford’s 0 365 42
allegations, 0 365 42
said 0 365 42
she 1 365 42
doubts 1 365 42
Judge 1 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 42
credibility 1 365 42
because 1 365 42
of 1 365 42
“how 1 365 42
he 1 365 42
approaches 1 365 42
his 1 365 42
cases.” 1 365 42
Aside 0 365 42
from 0 365 42
mischaracterizing 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
constitutional 0 365 42
textualist 0 365 42
reasoning 0 365 42
underlying 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
opinions, 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
is 0 365 42
saying 0 365 42
that 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
does 0 365 42
not 0 365 42
believe 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
denial 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
sexual 0 365 42
misconduct 0 365 42
allegations 0 365 42
lodged 0 365 42
against 0 365 42
him 0 365 42
because 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
opinions 0 365 42
he 0 365 42
wrote 0 365 42
that 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
does 0 365 42
not 0 365 42
like. 0 365 42

Such 0 365 43
circular 0 365 43
“reasoning” 0 365 43
would 0 365 43
be 0 365 43
amusing 0 365 43
if 0 365 43
it 0 365 43
were 0 365 43
not 0 365 43
so 0 365 43
emblematic 0 365 43
of 0 365 43
what 0 365 43
one 0 365 43
writer 0 365 43
called 0 365 43
“Kavanaugh 1 365 43
Derangement 1 365 43
Syndrome." 1 365 43

Senator 0 365 44
Kirsten 0 365 44
Gillibrand 0 365 44
(D-N.Y.) 0 365 44
is 0 365 44
also 0 365 44
suffering 0 365 44
from 0 365 44
the 0 365 44
same 0 365 44
syndrome. 0 365 44

She 0 365 45
said 0 365 45
Thursday 0 365 45
regarding 0 365 45
Ms. 0 365 45
Ford: 0 365 45
"I 0 365 45
believe 1 365 45
her 1 365 45
because 1 365 45
she 1 365 45
is 1 365 45
telling 1 365 45
the 1 365 45
truth 1 365 45
and 1 365 45
you 1 365 45
know 1 365 45
it 1 365 45
by 1 365 45
her 1 365 45
story." 1 365 45

Ms. 0 365 46
Ford’s 0 365 46
supporters 0 365 46
are 0 365 46
exploiting 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
“Me 1 365 46
Too” 1 365 46
movement 1 365 46
to 0 365 46
declare 0 365 46
Judge 0 365 46
Kavanaugh 0 365 46
guilty 0 365 46
simply 1 365 46
because 1 365 46
Ms. 1 365 46
Ford 1 365 46
is 1 365 46
a 1 365 46
woman 1 365 46
who 1 365 46
has 1 365 46
made 1 365 46
what 1 365 46
they 1 365 46
call, 1 365 46
without 1 365 46
any 1 365 46
corroborating 1 365 46
evidence 1 365 46
to 1 365 46
date, 1 365 46
a 1 365 46
“credible” 1 365 46
charge. 1 365 46

The 0 365 47
same 0 365 47
would 0 365 47
presumably 0 365 47
be 0 365 47
the 0 365 47
case 0 365 47
for 0 365 47
Ms. 0 365 47
Ramirez. 0 365 47

They 0 365 48
argue 0 365 48
that 0 365 48
since 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
Senate 0 365 48
Judiciary 0 365 48
Committee 0 365 48
is 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
criminal 0 365 48
judicial 0 365 48
trial, 0 365 48
but 0 365 48
rather 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
legislative 0 365 48
hearing 0 365 48
for 0 365 48
confirmation 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
Supreme 0 365 48
Court 0 365 48
nominee, 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
normal 0 365 48
burden 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
proof 0 365 48
shouldered 0 365 48
by 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
accuser 0 365 48
should 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
apply. 0 365 48

Judge 0 365 49
Kavanaugh 0 365 49
should 0 365 49
have 0 365 49
to 0 365 49
prove 0 365 49
that 0 365 49
he 0 365 49
is 0 365 49
not 0 365 49
guilty, 0 365 49
they 0 365 49
are 0 365 49
in 0 365 49
effect 0 365 49
insisting. 0 365 49

This 0 365 50
is 0 365 50
another 0 365 50
case 0 365 50
of 0 365 50
Kavanaugh 1 365 50
Derangement 1 365 50
Syndrome. 1 365 50

Let’s 0 365 51
assume 0 365 51
for 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
sake 0 365 51
of 0 365 51
argument 0 365 51
that 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
normal 0 365 51
burden 0 365 51
on 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
prosecution 0 365 51
in 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
criminal 0 365 51
case 0 365 51
- 0 365 51
to 0 365 51
prove 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
accused’s 0 365 51
guilt 0 365 51
beyond 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
reasonable 0 365 51
doubt 0 365 51
- 0 365 51
is 0 365 51
not 0 365 51
applicable 0 365 51
regarding 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
charge 0 365 51
against 0 365 51
Judge 0 365 51
Kavanaugh 0 365 51
since 0 365 51
he 0 365 51
is 0 365 51
not 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
defendant 0 365 51
in 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
criminal 0 365 51
trial. 0 365 51

However, 0 365 52
that 0 365 52
should 0 365 52
not 0 365 52
flip 0 365 52
the 0 365 52
burden 0 365 52
of 0 365 52
proof 0 365 52
onto 0 365 52
Judge 0 365 52
Kavanaugh 0 365 52
altogether. 0 365 52

Judge 0 365 53
Kavanaugh 0 365 53
is 0 365 53
being 0 365 53
subjected 0 365 53
to 0 365 53
charges 0 365 53
of 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
criminal 0 365 53
nature 0 365 53
that 0 365 53
could 0 365 53
not 0 365 53
only 0 365 53
deprive 0 365 53
him 0 365 53
of 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
seat 0 365 53
on 0 365 53
the 0 365 53
Supreme 0 365 53
Court 0 365 53
for 0 365 53
which 0 365 53
he 0 365 53
is 0 365 53
otherwise 0 365 53
eminently 0 365 53
qualified. 0 365 53

Ms. 0 365 54
Ford’s 0 365 54
unsubstantiated 0 365 54
accusation 0 365 54
can 0 365 54
completely 1 365 54
destroy 1 365 54
Judge 1 365 54
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 54
life 1 365 54
by 0 365 54
causing 0 365 54
irreparable 0 365 54
damage 0 365 54
to 0 365 54
his 0 365 54
reputation 0 365 54
for 0 365 54
integrity 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
good 0 365 54
character 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
to 0 365 54
his 0 365 54
career, 0 365 54
which 0 365 54
he 0 365 54
has 0 365 54
built 0 365 54
up 0 365 54
during 0 365 54
decades 0 365 54
of 0 365 54
public 0 365 54
service. 0 365 54

His 0 365 55
family’s 0 365 55
lives 0 365 55
have 0 365 55
been 0 365 55
completely 0 365 55
upended. 0 365 55

Placing 0 365 56
the 0 365 56
burden 0 365 56
on 0 365 56
Judge 0 365 56
Kavanaugh 0 365 56
to 0 365 56
prove 0 365 56
that 0 365 56
he 0 365 56
was 0 365 56
not 0 365 56
involved 0 365 56
in 0 365 56
an 0 365 56

Ms. 0 365 57

all 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
evidence 0 365 57
presented. 0 365 57

This 1 365 58

If 0 365 60
Ms. 0 365 60

upon 0 365 60
the 0 365 60

set 0 365 60
by 0 365 60
the 0 365 60

Ms. 0 365 61

Judge 0 365 61

the 0 365 61

as 0 365 61
well 0 365 61
as 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
American 0 365 61
public 0 365 61
following 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
testimony 0 365 61
must 0 365 61
remember 0 365 61
one 0 365 61
cardinal 0 365 61
rule. 0 365 61

In 1 365 62
a 1 365 62
nation 1 365 62
guided 1 365 62
by 1 365 62
fairness 1 365 62
and 1 365 62
law, 1 365 62
a 1 365 62
person 1 365 62
is 1 365 62
innocent 1 365 62
until 1 365 62
proven 1 365 62
guilty. 1 365 62

Sadly, 0 365 63
many 0 365 63
of 0 365 63
Judge 1 365 63
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 63
haters 1 365 63
have 0 365 63
thrown 0 365 63
that 0 365 63
rule 0 365 63
aside. 0 365 63

If 0 365 64
Judge 0 365 64
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 64

a 0 365 64
result 0 365 64
of 0 365 64
the 0 365 64

and 0 365 64
character 1 365 64
assassination, 1 365 64
President 0 365 64

someone 0 365 64
on 0 365 64
his 0 365 64
short 0 365 64

such 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
Amy 0 365 64

and 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
Senate 0 365 64
Republican 0 365 64
majority 0 365 64
should 0 365 64

Suspiciously, 1 366 3
Ford 1 366 3
can’t 1 366 3
–or 1 366 3
won’t— 1 366 3
say 1 366 3
when 1 366 3
or 1 366 3
where 1 366 3
the 1 366 3
alleged 1 366 3

happened 1 366 3
and 1 366 3
can 1 366 3
provide 1 366 3
few 1 366 3

to 0 366 6
learn 0 366 6
from 0 366 6

usual, 0 366 7
Republicans’ 0 366 7

Democrats, 0 366 9
it 0 366 9

out, 0 366 9
used 0 366 9
the 0 366 9

to 0 366 11
support 0 366 11
Kavanaugh, 0 366 11
who 0 366 11
maintains 0 366 11
his 0 366 11
innocence. 0 366 11

“This 0 366 12

event 0 366 12
from 0 366 12
35 0 366 12

ago 0 366 12
did 0 366 12
not 0 366 12
happen,” 0 366 12
the 0 366 12
nominee 0 366 12

Sunday 0 366 12
of 0 366 12

accusations. 0 366 12

“The 0 366 13
people 0 366 13
who 0 366 13
knew 0 366 13

happen, 0 366 13
and 0 366 13
have 0 366 13
said 0 366 13
so. 0 366 13

This 0 366 14
is 0 366 14
a 0 366 14
smear, 1 366 14
plain 0 366 14
and 0 366 14
simple. 0 366 14

I 0 366 15
look 0 366 15
forward 0 366 15
to 0 366 15
testifying 0 366 15
on 0 366 15
Thursday 0 366 15
about 0 366 15

— 0 366 15
against 0 366 15
these 0 366 15
last-minute 0 366 15

If 0 366 16

October 0 366 16

the 0 366 16

its 0 366 16
new 0 366 16

The 0 366 17
high 0 366 17
court 0 366 17
normally 0 366 17
has 0 366 17
a 0 366 17
complement 0 366 17

nine 0 366 17

The 0 366 21

in 0 369 11
the 0 369 11

bork 0 369 11

derail 0 369 11
the 0 369 11
confirmation 0 369 11
process 0 369 11
for 0 369 11
partisan 0 369 11
advantage, 0 369 11
the 0 369 11
Republicans 0 369 11
seem 0 369 11
to 0 369 11
be 0 369 11
reverting 0 369 11

All 0 369 12
the 1 369 12
Dems 1 369 12
have 0 369 12
to 0 369 12
do 0 369 12
is 1 369 12
squeal 1 369 12
“sexism” 0 369 12
and 0 369 12
Republicans 0 369 12
start 0 369 12
negotiating 0 369 12
and 0 369 12
offering 0 369 12
concessions. 0 369 12

Of 0 369 13
course, 0 369 13
after 0 369 13
each 0 369 13
concession 0 369 13
comes 0 369 13
another 0 369 13
demand. 0 369 13

First 0 369 14
the 1 369 14
Dems 1 369 14
demanded 0 369 14
that 0 369 14
Ford, 0 369 14
a 0 369 14
long-time 0 369 14
Democrat 0 369 14
activist, 0 369 14
“be 0 369 14
heard.” 0 369 14
So 0 369 14
last 0 369 14
week 0 369 14
the 0 369 14
Chairman 0 369 14
of 0 369 14

Committee, 0 369 14
Chuck 0 369 14

granted 0 369 14
another 0 369 14
deadline 0 369 14
extension 0 369 14
for 0 369 14
Ford 0 369 14
to 0 369 14

whether 0 369 14
to 0 369 14
testify 0 369 14
before 0 369 14
the 0 369 14

on 0 369 14
Monday. 0 369 14

Senator 0 369 15
Dianne 0 369 15
Feinstein 0 369 15
calls 0 369 15
these 0 369 15
concessions 0 369 15
“bullying 1 369 15
deadlines.” 1 369 15
As 0 369 15
Feinstein 0 369 15
put 0 369 15
it, 0 369 15
“Show 0 369 15
some 0 369 15
heart. 0 369 15

Wait 0 369 16
until 0 369 16
Dr. 0 369 16
Ford 0 369 16
feels 0 369 16
that 0 369 16
she 0 369 16
can 0 369 16
come 0 369 16
before 0 369 16
the 0 369 16

Ford 0 369 16
doesn’t 0 369 16
“feel” 0 369 16
like 0 369 16
she 0 369 16
can 0 369 16
testify 0 369 16
on 0 369 16
Monday 0 369 16
because 0 369 16
she’s 0 369 16
afraid 0 369 16
of 0 369 16
flying, 0 369 16
despite 0 369 16
offers 0 369 16
from 0 369 16
the 0 369 16
Committee 0 369 16
to 0 369 16
travel 0 369 16
to 0 369 16
her 0 369 16
in 0 369 16
California. 0 369 16

Then 0 369 17
she 0 369 17
feared 0 369 17
for 0 369 17
her 0 369 17
life 0 369 17
because 0 369 17
of 0 369 17
death 0 369 17
threats 0 369 17
––threats 0 369 17
also 0 369 17
made 0 369 17
to 0 369 17
Kavanaugh, 0 369 17
his 0 369 17
wife 0 369 17
and 0 369 17
two 0 369 17
young 0 369 17
daughters–– 0 369 17
so 0 369 17
she 0 369 17
now 0 369 17
demands 0 369 17
enhanced 0 369 17
security 0 369 17
measures. 0 369 17

The 0 369 18
Committee 0 369 18
caved 0 369 18
and 0 369 18
moved 0 369 18
the 0 369 18
date 0 369 18
to 0 369 18
Thursday. 0 369 18

So 0 369 19
of 0 369 19
course, 0 369 19
Grassley 0 369 19
having 0 369 19
been 0 369 19
intimidated 0 369 19
into 0 369 19
giving 0 369 19
Ford 0 369 19
a 0 369 19
chance 0 369 19
to 0 369 19
address 0 369 19
the 0 369 19
Committee, 0 369 19
Ramirez 0 369 19
and 0 369 19
her 0 369 19
handlers 0 369 19
are 0 369 19
now 0 369 19
demanding 0 369 19
the 0 369 19
same 0 369 19
privilege. 0 369 19

“Creepy 1 369 20

a 0 369 20

who 0 369 20
also 0 369 20
should 0 369 20
be 0 369 20
allowed 0 369 20

to 0 369 20

while 0 369 20
at 0 369 20
Yale. 0 369 20

We’ll 0 369 21
have 0 369 21
to 0 369 21
see 0 369 21
whether 0 369 21
Grassley 0 369 21
can 0 369 21
find 1 369 21
the 1 369 21
stomach 1 369 21
to 1 369 21
put 1 369 21
an 1 369 21
end 1 369 21
to 1 369 21
the 1 369 21
farce 1 369 21
of 0 369 21
allowing 0 369 21
unsubstantiated 0 369 21
charges 0 369 21
from 0 369 21
Democrat 0 369 21
activists 0 369 21
to 0 369 21
waste 0 369 21
the 0 369 21
Committee’s 0 369 21
time. 0 369 21

Ford 0 369 22
and 0 369 22
Dianne 0 369 22
Feinstein 0 369 22
also 0 369 22
keep 0 369 22
demanding 0 369 22
an 0 369 22
FBI 0 369 22
investigation, 0 369 22
even 0 369 22
though 0 369 22
no 0 369 22
federal 0 369 22
crime 0 369 22
is 0 369 22
being 0 369 22
alleged, 0 369 22
and 0 369 22
any 0 369 22

36 0 369 22
years 0 369 22
after 0 369 22
the 0 369 22
offense 0 369 22
is 0 369 22
impossible. 0 369 22

Ford 0 369 23
can’t 0 369 23
remember 0 369 23
where 0 369 23
and 0 369 23
when 0 369 23
the 0 369 23
alleged 0 369 23
assault 0 369 23
took 0 369 23
place, 0 369 23
nor 0 369 23
how 0 369 23
she 0 369 23
got 0 369 23
to 0 369 23
or 0 369 23
went 0 369 23
home 0 369 23
from 0 369 23
the 0 369 23
party 0 369 23
where 0 369 23
it 0 369 23
allegedly 0 369 23
occurred. 0 369 23

Her 1 369 24
own 1 369 24
details 1 369 24
of 1 369 24
the 1 369 24
event 1 369 24

jibe 1 369 24
(Four 1 369 24

or 1 369 24
three? 1 369 24

One 1 369 25
girl 1 369 25
or 1 369 25
two?). 1 369 25

She 0 369 26
told 0 369 26
no 0 369 26
one 0 369 26
about 0 369 26
the 0 369 26
assault 0 369 26
until 0 369 26
30 0 369 26
years 0 369 26
later. 0 369 26

A 0 369 27
“lifelong 0 369 27
friend” 0 369 27
whom 0 369 27
Ford 0 369 27
claims 0 369 27
was 0 369 27
at 0 369 27
the 0 369 27
party 0 369 27
has 0 369 27
denied 0 369 27
any 0 369 27
knowledge 0 369 27
of 0 369 27
the 0 369 27
it, 0 369 27
and 0 369 27
says 0 369 27
she’s 0 369 27
never 0 369 27
met 0 369 27
Kavanaugh. 0 369 27

Another 0 369 28
friend 0 369 28
who 0 369 28
reported 0 369 28
that 0 369 28
the 0 369 28
school 0 369 28
was 0 369 28
abuzz 0 369 28
with 0 369 28
gossip 0 369 28
about 0 369 28
the 0 369 28
attack 0 369 28
(which 0 369 28
apparently 0 369 28
took 0 369 28
place 0 369 28
during 0 369 28
summer 0 369 28
break), 0 369 28
retracted 0 369 28
her 0 369 28
statement. 0 369 28

The 0 369 29
two 0 369 29
men 0 369 29
Ford 0 369 29
named 0 369 29
as 0 369 29
possible 0 369 29
witnesses 0 369 29
to 0 369 29
the 0 369 29
assault 0 369 29
have 0 369 29
contradicter 0 369 29
her 0 369 29
claims 0 369 29
under 0 369 29
oath. 0 369 29

And 0 369 30
the 0 369 30
accused 0 369 30
Judge 0 369 30
Kavanaugh 0 369 30
also 0 369 30
under 0 369 30
oath 0 369 30
vehemently 1 369 30
denies 1 369 30
the 0 369 30
charges. 0 369 30

Given 0 369 31
that 0 369 31
36 0 369 31
years 0 369 31
have 0 369 31
passed 0 369 31
since 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
incident, 0 369 31
and 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
accuser’s 0 369 31
memory 0 369 31
is 0 369 31
so 0 369 31
hazy 0 369 31
and 0 369 31
short 0 369 31
on 0 369 31
coherent 0 369 31
details, 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
FBI 0 369 31
has 0 369 31
nothing 0 369 31
to 0 369 31
investigate. 0 369 31

Ramirez’s 0 369 32
charge 0 369 32
is 0 369 32
even 0 369 32
flimsier. 0 369 32

Here’s 0 369 33
a 0 369 33
catalogue 0 369 33
from 0 369 33
the 0 369 33
Daily 0 369 33
Wire: 0 369 33

1. 0 369 34

The 0 369 35
New 0 369 35
Yorker 0 369 35
could 0 369 35
not 0 369 35
find 0 369 35
a 0 369 35
single 0 369 35
witness 0 369 35
who 0 369 35
could 0 369 35
put 0 369 35
Kavanaugh 0 369 35
at 0 369 35
the 0 369 35
alleged 0 369 35
party. 0 369 35

2. 0 369 36

The 0 369 37
New 0 369 37
York 0 369 37
Times 0 369 37
could 0 369 37
not 0 369 37
find 0 369 37
a 0 369 37
single 0 369 37
person 0 369 37
who 0 369 37
could 0 369 37
corroborate 0 369 37
Ramirez’s 0 369 37
claims. 0 369 37

3. 0 369 38

The 0 369 39
man 0 369 39
accused 0 369 39
of 0 369 39
egging 0 369 39
on 0 369 39
Kavanaugh 0 369 39
denied 0 369 39
Ramirez's 0 369 39
allegations 0 369 39
and 0 369 39
vouched 0 369 39
for 0 369 39
Kavanaugh’s 0 369 39
character. 0 369 39

4. 0 369 40

A 0 369 41
third 0 369 41
person 0 369 41
that 0 369 41
Ramirez 0 369 41
claimed 0 369 41
was 0 369 41
at 0 369 41
the 0 369 41
party 0 369 41
says 0 369 41
she 0 369 41
was 0 369 41
not 0 369 41
there 0 369 41
for 0 369 41
the 0 369 41
alleged 0 369 41
incident. 0 369 41

5. 0 369 42

Ramirez 0 369 43
contacted 0 369 43
her 0 369 43
former 0 369 43
classmates, 0 369 43
asking 0 369 43
about 0 369 43
the 0 369 43
incident, 0 369 43
and 0 369 43
admitted 0 369 43
she 0 369 43
was 0 369 43
not 0 369 43
sure 0 369 43
that 0 369 43
Kavanaugh 0 369 43
was 0 369 43
the 0 369 43
male 0 369 43
who 0 369 43
exposed 0 369 43
himself. 0 369 43

6. 0 369 44

A 0 369 45
woman 0 369 45
who 0 369 45
claims 0 369 45
she 0 369 45
was 0 369 45
“best 0 369 45
friends” 0 369 45
with 0 369 45
Ramirez 0 369 45
says 0 369 45
Ramirez 0 369 45
never 0 369 45
mentioned 0 369 45
the 0 369 45
story 0 369 45
and 0 369 45
initially 0 369 45
said 0 369 45
her 0 369 45
friend's 0 369 45
accusations 0 369 45
against 0 369 45
Kavanaugh 0 369 45
might 0 369 45
be 0 369 45
“politically 0 369 45
motivated.” 0 369 45

7. 0 369 46

Ramirez, 0 369 47
just 0 369 47
like 0 369 47
Christine 0 369 47
Blasey 0 369 47
Ford, 0 369 47
is 0 369 47
a 0 369 47
registered 0 369 47
Democrat 0 369 47
and 0 369 47
is 0 369 47
dedicated 0 369 47
to 0 369 47
leftist 0 369 47
causes. 0 369 47

8. 0 369 48

Ramirez 0 369 49
wasn’t 0 369 49
even 0 369 49
sure 0 369 49
her 0 369 49
memory 0 369 49
was 0 369 49
correct 0 369 49
— 0 369 49
until 0 369 49
she 0 369 49
spent 0 369 49
six 0 369 49
days 0 369 49
going 0 369 49
over 0 369 49
it 0 369 49
with 0 369 49
her 1 369 49
Democrat 1 369 49
lawyer. 1 369 49

9. 0 369 50

Ramirez 0 369 51
admits 0 369 51
there 0 369 51
are 0 369 51
holes 0 369 51
in 0 369 51
her 0 369 51
memory 0 369 51
due 0 369 51
to 0 369 51
how 0 369 51
much 0 369 51
she 0 369 51
drank 0 369 51
at 0 369 51
the 0 369 51
party. 0 369 51

10. 0 369 52

People 0 369 53
who 0 369 53
knew 0 369 53
Ramirez 0 369 53
after 0 369 53
her 0 369 53
time 0 369 53
at 0 369 53
Yale 0 369 53
say 0 369 53
that 0 369 53
she 0 369 53
never 0 369 53
once 0 369 53
mentioned 0 369 53
the 0 369 53
incident 0 369 53
— 0 369 53
until 0 369 53
Kavanaugh's 0 369 53
nomination 0 369 53
was 0 369 53
pending. 0 369 53

No 0 369 54
law 0 369 54
enforcement 0 369 54
agency, 0 369 54
let 0 369 54
alone 0 369 54
the 0 369 54
FBI, 0 369 54
would 0 369 54
waste 0 369 54
its 0 369 54
time 0 369 54
with 0 369 54
an 0 369 54
allegation 0 369 54
of 0 369 54
a 0 369 54
crime 0 369 54
decades 0 369 54
in 0 369 54
the 0 369 54
past, 0 369 54
and 0 369 54
so 0 369 54
patently 0 369 54
incoherent 0 369 54
and 0 369 54
lacking 0 369 54
in 0 369 54
evidence. 0 369 54

The 0 369 55
“FBI 0 369 55
investigation” 0 369 55
is 0 369 55
another 0 369 55
delaying 0 369 55
tactic. 0 369 55

Ford 0 369 56
has 0 369 56
finally 0 369 56
agreed 0 369 56
to 0 369 56
testify, 0 369 56
set 0 369 56
for 0 369 56
Thursday 0 369 56
for 0 369 56
now. 0 369 56

But 0 369 57
it’s 0 369 57
unclear 0 369 57
whether 0 369 57
Grassley 0 369 57
has 0 369 57
granted 0 369 57
Ford 0 369 57
any 0 369 57
of 0 369 57
her 0 369 57
preposterous 1 369 57
conditions 1 369 57
for 0 369 57
testifying: 0 369 57
She 0 369 57
will 0 369 57
take 0 369 57
questions 0 369 57
from 0 369 57
the 0 369 57
Committee, 0 369 57
but 0 369 57
not 0 369 57
from 0 369 57
outside 0 369 57
lawyers, 0 369 57
who 0 369 57
might 0 369 57
not 0 369 57
be 0 369 57
as 0 369 57
gentle 0 369 57
as 0 369 57
politicians 1 369 57
with 1 369 57
one 1 369 57
eye 1 369 57
on 1 369 57
the 1 369 57
polls. 1 369 57

Only 0 369 58
one 0 369 58
camera 0 369 58
can 0 369 58
be 0 369 58
in 0 369 58
the 0 369 58
room. 0 369 58

Kavanaugh 0 369 59
must 0 369 59
testify 0 369 59
first, 0 369 59
a 1 369 59
grotesque 1 369 59
inversion 1 369 59
of 0 369 59
our 1 369 59
bedrock 1 369 59
principle 1 369 59
that 1 369 59
an 1 369 59
accused 1 369 59
has 1 369 59
the 1 369 59
right 1 369 59
to 1 369 59
confront 1 369 59
his 1 369 59
accuser’s 1 369 59
charges. 1 369 59

He 0 369 60
can’t 0 369 60
be 0 369 60
in 0 369 60
the 0 369 60
room 0 369 60
with 0 369 60
her, 0 369 60
apparently 0 369 60
because 0 369 60
she’s 0 369 60
still 0 369 60
traumatized 0 369 60
and 0 369 60
may 0 369 60
start 0 369 60
experiencing 0 369 60
flashbacks. 0 369 60

So 0 369 61
much 0 369 61
for 0 369 61
“I 0 369 61
am 1 369 61
woman, 1 369 61
hear 1 369 61
me 1 369 61
roar.” 1 369 61

Grassley 0 369 62
shouldn’t 0 369 62
cave 0 369 62
on 0 369 62
these 0 369 62
conditions. 0 369 62

They 0 369 63
all 0 369 63
comprise 0 369 63
the 0 369 63
old 0 369 63
tactic 0 369 63
of 0 369 63
serially 0 369 63
escalating 0 369 63
demands 0 369 63
that 0 369 63
cannot 0 369 63
be 0 369 63
satisfied 0 369 63
in 0 369 63
order 0 369 63
to 0 369 63
compel 0 369 63
your 0 369 63
enemy 0 369 63
to 0 369 63
give 0 369 63
in. 0 369 63

That 0 369 64
Grassley 0 369 64
and 0 369 64
the 0 369 64
Republicans 0 369 64
would 0 369 64
even 0 369 64
participate 0 369 64
in 0 369 64
this 0 369 64
absurd 1 369 64
show 1 369 64
trial 1 369 64
is 0 369 64
testimony 0 369 64
to 0 369 64
how 0 369 64
deeply 0 369 64
the 0 369 64
progressive 0 369 64
ideological 0 369 64
narrative 0 369 64
has 0 369 64
burrowed 0 369 64
into 0 369 64
our 0 369 64
social 0 369 64
and 0 369 64
political 0 369 64
life. 0 369 64

If 0 369 65
Ford 0 369 65
actually 0 369 65
testifies 0 369 65
on 0 369 65
Thursday, 0 369 65
or 0 369 65
Ramirez 0 369 65
is 0 369 65
granted 0 369 65
the 0 369 65
same 0 369 65
concession, 0 369 65
nothing 0 369 65
material 0 369 65
will 0 369 65
be 0 369 65
gained. 0 369 65

Her 0 369 66
accusation 0 369 66
will 0 369 66
not 0 369 66
be 0 369 66
proved 0 369 66
true 0 369 66
or 0 369 66
false. 0 369 66

We 0 369 67
will 0 369 67
learn 0 369 67
nothing 0 369 67
about 0 369 67
Kavanaugh 0 369 67
that 0 369 67
makes 0 369 67
him 0 369 67
any 0 369 67
less 0 369 67
eminently 0 369 67
qualified 0 369 67
for 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
Supreme 0 369 67
Court, 0 369 67
nothing 0 369 67
that 0 369 67
can 0 369 67
add 0 369 67
to 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
thousands 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
pages 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
documents 0 369 67
already 0 369 67
presented 0 369 67
to 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
Committee, 0 369 67
or 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
hundreds 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
hours 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
judge’s 0 369 67
testimony 0 369 67
before 0 369 67
rabid 1 369 67
partisans 1 369 67
and 1 369 67
office-seekers. 1 369 67

But 0 369 68
vetting 0 369 68
Kavanaugh’s 0 369 68
qualifications 0 369 68
isn’t 0 369 68
the 0 369 68
point. 0 369 68

The 0 369 69
point 0 369 69
is 0 369 69
to 0 369 69
delay 0 369 69
confirmation 0 369 69
by 0 369 69
slandering 0 369 69
Kavanaugh 0 369 69
and 0 369 69
baiting 0 369 69
the 0 369 69
Republicans 0 369 69
into 0 369 69
appearing 0 369 69
to 0 369 69
abuse 0 369 69
victims 0 369 69
of 0 369 69
sexual 0 369 69
assault. 0 369 69

Why? 0 369 70

Facing 0 369 71
his 0 369 71
likely 0 369 71
confirmation, 0 369 71
the 1 369 71
Dems, 1 369 71
egged 0 369 71
on 0 369 71
by 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
mainstream 0 369 71
media––especially 0 369 71
The 0 369 71
New 0 369 71
Yorker, 0 369 71
which 0 369 71
published 0 369 71
a 0 369 71
story 0 369 71
too 0 369 71
badly 0 369 71
sourced 0 369 71
even 0 369 71
for 0 369 71
The 0 369 71
New 0 369 71
York 0 369 71
Times–– 0 369 71
are 0 369 71
desperately 0 369 71
attempting 0 369 71
to 0 369 71
obstruct 0 369 71
and 0 369 71
delay 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
process 0 369 71
until 0 369 71
after 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
midterm 0 369 71
elections, 0 369 71
when 0 369 71
they 0 369 71
hope 0 369 71
they 0 369 71
will 0 369 71
retake 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
Senate 0 369 71
and 0 369 71
thus 0 369 71
stop 0 369 71
any 0 369 71
more 0 369 71
Constitutionalist 0 369 71
judges 0 369 71
from 0 369 71
being 0 369 71
confirmed 0 369 71
to 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
Court 0 369 71
for 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
rest 0 369 71
of 0 369 71
Trump’s 0 369 71
term. 0 369 71

The 0 369 72
Democrats 0 369 72
have 0 369 72
stooped 1 369 72
so 1 369 72
low 1 369 72
with 1 369 72
these 1 369 72
smears 1 369 72
because 0 369 72
they 0 369 72
know 0 369 72
the 0 369 72
stakes. 0 369 72

The 0 369 73
courts 0 369 73
and 0 369 73
especially 0 369 73
the 0 369 73
Supreme 0 369 73
Court 0 369 73
have 0 369 73
been 0 369 73
critical 0 369 73
to 0 369 73
the 0 369 73
progressives’ 0 369 73
program 0 369 73
since 0 369 73
Woodrow 0 369 73
Wilson. 0 369 73

The 0 369 74
biggest 0 369 74
obstacle 0 369 74
to 0 369 74
the 0 369 74
progressive 0 369 74
dream 0 369 74
of 0 369 74
government 0 369 74
controlled 0 369 74
and 0 369 74
managed 0 369 74
by 0 369 74
a 0 369 74
technocratic 0 369 74
oligarchy 0 369 74
has 0 369 74
been 0 369 74
the 0 369 74
Constitution. 0 369 74

Its 0 369 75
divided 0 369 75
and 0 369 75
balanced 0 369 75
powers 0 369 75
were 0 369 75
designed 0 369 75
precisely 0 369 75
to 0 369 75
rein 0 369 75
in 0 369 75
overreaching 0 369 75
ambition 0 369 75
and 0 369 75
concentrations 0 369 75
of 0 369 75
power. 0 369 75

Hence 0 369 76
the 0 369 76
Constitutional 0 369 76
order 0 369 76
must 0 369 76
be 0 369 76
subverted 0 369 76
by 0 369 76
the 0 369 76
Supreme 0 369 76
Court 0 369 76
and 0 369 76
its 0 369 76
unaccountable 0 369 76
justices 0 369 76
enjoying 0 369 76
lifelong 0 369 76
tenure. 0 369 76

But 0 369 77
if 0 369 77
Kavanaugh 0 369 77
is 0 369 77
confirmed, 0 369 77
there 0 369 77
will 0 369 77
be 0 369 77
five 0 369 77
reliably 0 369 77
Constitutionalist 0 369 77
justices 0 369 77
on 0 369 77
the 0 369 77
bench, 0 369 77
who 0 369 77
are 0 369 77
unlikely 0 369 77
to 0 369 77
tolerate 0 369 77
judicial 0 369 77
usurpation 0 369 77
of 0 369 77
Congress’s 0 369 77
law-making 0 369 77
powers. 0 369 77

That’s 0 369 78
why 0 369 78
this 0 369 78
current 0 369 78
nomination 0 369 78
is 0 369 78
a 0 369 78
hill 0 369 78
the 1 369 78
Dems 1 369 78
are 0 369 78
willing 0 369 78
to 1 369 78
beclown 1 369 78
themselves 1 369 78
on. 1 369 78

Given 0 369 79
how 0 369 79
obviously 1 369 79
partisan 1 369 79
and 1 369 79
hypocritical 1 369 79
this 0 369 79
ploy 0 369 79
is––doesn’t 0 369 79
Keith 0 369 79
Ellison’s 0 369 79
accuser 0 369 79
deserve 0 369 79
to 0 369 79
be 0 369 79
heard 0 369 79
and 0 369 79
believed 0 369 79
too? 0 369 79

––why 1 369 80
has 1 369 80
Grassley 1 369 80
so 1 369 80
far 1 369 80
allowed 1 369 80
himself 1 369 80
to 1 369 80
be 1 369 80
played 1 369 80
by 1 369 80
the 1 369 80
Dems? 1 369 80

Because 0 369 81
Republicans 0 369 81
fear 0 369 81
the 0 369 81
backlash 0 369 81
from 0 369 81
all 0 369 81
those 0 369 81
women 0 369 81
voters 0 369 81
who 0 369 81
presumably 0 369 81
agree 0 369 81
with 0 369 81
the 0 369 81
fundamentalist 0 369 81
feminists, 0 369 81
and 0 369 81
insist 0 369 81
that 0 369 81
every 1 369 81
accusation 1 369 81
of 1 369 81
sexual 1 369 81
assault, 1 369 81
no 1 369 81
matter 1 369 81
how 1 369 81
much 1 369 81
it’s 1 369 81
unsupported 1 369 81
by 1 369 81
corroborating 1 369 81
evidence 1 369 81
or 1 369 81
even 1 369 81
plausibility, 1 369 81
must 1 369 81
be 1 369 81
believed. 1 369 81

This 0 369 82
contention 0 369 82
itself 0 369 82
is 0 369 82
an 0 369 82
expression 0 369 82
of 0 369 82
the 0 369 82
radical 0 369 82
feminist 0 369 82
narrative 0 369 82
of 0 369 82
innate 0 369 82
male 0 369 82
feral 1 369 82
sexuality 1 369 82
that 0 369 82
makes 0 369 82
them 0 369 82
sexual 1 369 82
predators. 1 369 82

The 0 369 83
irony 0 369 83
is 0 369 83
that 0 369 83
today’s 0 369 83
feminists 0 369 83
have 0 369 83
been 0 369 83
willing 0 369 83
to 0 369 83
sacrifice 0 369 83
the 0 369 83
earlier 0 369 83
narrative 0 369 83
of 0 369 83
female 0 369 83
power 0 369 83
and 0 369 83
agency 0 369 83
that 0 369 83
had 0 369 83
been 0 369 83
stifled 0 369 83
by 0 369 83
traditional 0 369 83
views 0 369 83
of 0 369 83
the 0 369 83
sexes 0 369 83
and 0 369 83
their 0 369 83
capabilities. 0 369 83

Instead, 0 369 84
now 0 369 84
women 0 369 84
are 0 369 84
Victorian 1 369 84
hothouse 1 369 84
flowers 1 369 84
too 0 369 84
delicate 0 369 84
to 0 369 84
make 0 369 84
their 0 369 84
way 0 369 84
through 0 369 84
their 0 369 84
lives 0 369 84
without 0 369 84
the 0 369 84
paternal 0 369 84
federal 0 369 84
government 0 369 84
protecting 0 369 84
them 0 369 84
with 0 369 84
its 0 369 84
coercive 0 369 84
power. 0 369 84

Women 0 369 85
have 0 369 85
exchanged 0 369 85
one 0 369 85
form 0 369 85
of 0 369 85
dependence, 0 369 85
and 0 369 85
one 0 369 85
double 0 369 85
standard 0 369 85
for 0 369 85
another. 0 369 85

The 1 369 86
Dems 1 369 86
are 0 369 86
using 0 369 86
Ford 0 369 86
and 0 369 86
Ramirez 0 369 86
as 0 369 86
part 0 369 86
of 0 369 86
the 0 369 86
Democrats’ 0 369 86
transparently 0 369 86
dishonest 0 369 86
delaying 0 369 86
tactics 0 369 86
because 0 369 86
they 0 369 86
know 0 369 86
that 0 369 86
most 0 369 86
Republicans 0 369 86
have 0 369 86
accepted 0 369 86
this 0 369 86
duplicitous 0 369 86
feminist 0 369 86
narrative 0 369 86
and 0 369 86
fear 0 369 86
challenging 0 369 86
it. 0 369 86

Especially 0 369 87
after 0 369 87
the 0 369 87
recent 0 369 87
spate 0 369 87
of 0 369 87
sexual 0 369 87
assault 0 369 87
charges––many 0 369 87
of 0 369 87
them 0 369 87
true, 0 369 87
some 0 369 87
false, 0 369 87
others 0 369 87
contested–– 0 369 87
politicians 0 369 87
consider 0 369 87
bucking 0 369 87
the 0 369 87
narrative 0 369 87
to 0 369 87
be 0 369 87
as 0 369 87
politically 1 369 87
suicidal 1 369 87
as 0 369 87
proposing 0 369 87
to 0 369 87
reform 0 369 87
Social 0 369 87
Security 0 369 87
and 0 369 87
Medicare. 0 369 87

It’s 0 369 88
the 0 369 88
new 0 369 88
third 0 369 88
rail 0 369 88
of 0 369 88
American 0 369 88
politics, 0 369 88
one 0 369 88
that 0 369 88
transcends 0 369 88
party 0 369 88
affiliation. 0 369 88

Hence 0 369 89
the 0 369 89
widespread 0 369 89
virtue-signaling 0 369 89
on 0 369 89
the 0 369 89
part 0 369 89
even 0 369 89
of 0 369 89
conservative 0 369 89
writers 0 369 89
who 0 369 89
preface 0 369 89
their 0 369 89
comments 0 369 89
about 0 369 89
Ford 0 369 89
and 0 369 89
Ramirez 0 369 89
with 0 369 89
prologues 0 369 89
full 0 369 89
of 0 369 89
truisms 0 369 89
about 0 369 89
how 0 369 89
horrible 0 369 89
sexual 0 369 89
assault 0 369 89
is, 0 369 89
how 0 369 89
its 0 369 89
self-proclaimed 0 369 89
victims 0 369 89
“must 0 369 89
be 0 369 89
heard,” 0 369 89
and 0 369 89
how 0 369 89
churlish 0 369 89
and 0 369 89
sexist 0 369 89
it 0 369 89
is 0 369 89
to 0 369 89
question 0 369 89
the 0 369 89
truth 0 369 89
of 0 369 89
any 0 369 89
charge. 0 369 89

Grown-ups 0 369 90
know 0 369 90
all 0 369 90
that 0 369 90
and 0 369 90
don’t 0 369 90

every 0 369 90

the 0 369 90

The 1 369 91
Dems 1 369 91
know 0 369 91
that 0 369 91
most 0 369 91
Republicans 0 369 91
come 0 369 91
to 0 369 91
this 0 369 91
conflict 0 369 91

the 0 369 91
huge 0 369 91

that 0 369 91

dubious 1 369 91
ideology 1 369 91
and 1 369 91
dishonest 1 369 91
narrative. 1 369 91

The 0 369 92
progressive 0 369 92
party 0 369 92
can 0 369 92
dare 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
Republicans 0 369 92
to 0 369 92
ignore 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
endless 0 369 92
specious 0 369 92
demands, 0 369 92
stop 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
show-trial, 0 369 92
and 0 369 92
proceed 0 369 92
to 0 369 92
a 0 369 92
vote 0 369 92
on 0 369 92
Kavanaugh, 0 369 92
because 0 369 92
they 0 369 92
know 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
Republicans, 0 369 92
fearful 0 369 92
of 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
“optics,” 0 369 92
will 0 369 92
cave. 0 369 92

They 0 369 93
know 0 369 93
that 0 369 93
the 0 369 93
eleven 0 369 93
male 0 369 93

knuckle-dragging 1 369 93
Neanderthal 1 369 93
sexists 1 369 93
who 0 369 93
want 0 369 93
to 0 369 93
“silence” 0 369 93
the 0 369 93
accuser 0 369 93

as 0 369 93
one 0 369 93
Ford 0 369 93

has 0 369 93
said. 0 369 93

Republicans 0 369 94
still 0 369 94
don’t 0 369 94
get 0 369 94
that 0 369 94
no 0 369 94
amount 0 369 94
of 0 369 94
appeasement 0 369 94
will 0 369 94
stop 0 369 94
the 0 369 94
left 0 369 94
from 0 369 94
demonizing 1 369 94
them 1 369 94
anyway. 0 369 94

Just 0 369 95
ask 0 369 95
Boy 0 369 95
Scout 0 369 95
Mitt 0 369 95
Romney, 0 369 95
who 1 369 95
was 1 369 95
savaged 1 369 95
for 0 369 95
his 0 369 95
innocuous 0 369 95
“binders 0 369 95
full 0 369 95
of 0 369 95
women.” 0 369 95

And 0 369 96
don’t 0 369 96
forget, 0 369 96
the 0 369 96
old 0 369 96
sorta, 0 369 96
kinda 0 369 96
moderate 0 369 96
Democrats 0 369 96
like 0 369 96
Feinstein 0 369 96
and 0 369 96
Chuck 0 369 96
Schumer, 0 369 96
who 0 369 96
now 0 369 96
have 0 369 96
joined 0 369 96
the 0 369 96
crowd 0 369 96
of 0 369 96
trendoid 1 369 96
socialists 1 369 96
armed 1 369 96
with 1 369 96
torches 1 369 96
and 1 369 96
pitch-forks, 1 369 96
will 0 369 96
go 0 369 96
along 0 369 96
because 0 369 96
they’re 0 369 96
frightened 0 369 96
of 0 369 96
their 0 369 96
party’s 0 369 96
increasingly 1 369 96
rabid 1 369 96
left-wing 1 369 96
base. 1 369 96

What 0 369 97
can 0 369 97
we 0 369 97
do 0 369 97
to 0 369 97
end 0 369 97
these 0 369 97

Just 0 369 98
stop 0 369 98

There’s 0 369 99

Use. 0 370 15

The 0 370 16
department 0 370 16
then 0 370 16
went 0 370 16
on 0 370 16
to 0 370 16
note 0 370 16
that 0 370 16
Guyger 0 370 16
could 0 370 16
appeal 0 370 16
this 0 370 16
firing 0 370 16
under 0 370 16
their 0 370 16
civil 0 370 16
service 0 370 16
rules. 0 370 16

Officer 0 370 17
Guyger 0 370 17
was 0 370 17
terminated 0 370 17
for 0 370 17
her 0 370 17
actions. 0 370 17

She 0 370 18
was 0 370 18
hired 0 370 18
in 0 370 18
November 0 370 18
2013 0 370 18
and 0 370 18
was 0 370 18
assigned 0 370 18
to 0 370 18
the 0 370 18
Southeast 0 370 18
Patrol 0 370 18
Division. 0 370 18

Under 0 370 19
civil 0 370 19
service 0 370 19
rules, 0 370 19
Officer 0 370 19
Guyger 0 370 19
has 0 370 19
the 0 370 19
right 0 370 19
to 0 370 19
appeal 0 370 19
her 0 370 19
discipline. 0 370 19

This 0 370 20
move 0 370 20
is 0 370 20
noteworthy 0 370 20
as 0 370 20
the 0 370 20
department 0 370 20
has 0 370 20
been 0 370 20
standing 0 370 20
up 0 370 20
against 0 370 20
those 0 370 20
who 0 370 20
have 0 370 20
been 0 370 20
calling 0 370 20
for 0 370 20
the 0 370 20
officer 0 370 20
to 0 370 20
be 0 370 20
fired. 0 370 20

As 0 370 21
recently 0 370 21
as 0 370 21
Friday, 0 370 21
Hall 0 370 21
refused 0 370 21
to 0 370 21
fire 0 370 21
Guyger, 0 370 21
saying 0 370 21
in 0 370 21
part, 0 370 21
“There 0 370 21
is 0 370 21
one 0 370 21
overriding 0 370 21
reason 0 370 21
that 0 370 21
I 0 370 21
have 0 370 21
not 0 370 21
taken 0 370 21
any 0 370 21
administrative 0 370 21
or 0 370 21
employment 0 370 21
action 0 370 21
against 0 370 21
Officer 0 370 21
Amber 0 370 21
Guyger. 0 370 21

I 0 370 22
don’t 0 370 22
want 0 370 22
to 0 370 22
interfere 0 370 22
with 0 370 22
the 0 370 22
on-going 0 370 22
criminal 0 370 22
investigation 0 370 22
into 0 370 22
her 0 370 22
actions.” 0 370 22

Also, 0 370 23
in 0 370 23
a 0 370 23
town 0 370 23
hall 0 370 23
meeting 0 370 23
last 0 370 23
week, 0 370 23
Hall 0 370 23
again 0 370 23
stood 0 370 23
behind 0 370 23
her 0 370 23
choice 0 370 23
to 0 370 23
refuse 0 370 23
to 0 370 23
fire 0 370 23
Guyger, 0 370 23
claiming 0 370 23
it 0 370 23
would 0 370 23
be 0 370 23
against 0 370 23
the 0 370 23
law. 0 370 23

“I 0 370 24
can’t 0 370 24
do 0 370 24
that 0 370 24
because 0 370 24
there 0 370 24
are 0 370 24
both 0 370 24
local, 0 370 24
state 0 370 24
and 0 370 24
federal 0 370 24
laws 0 370 24
that 0 370 24
prohibit 0 370 24
me 0 370 24
from 0 370 24
taking 0 370 24
action. 0 370 24

There 0 370 25
are 0 370 25
civil 0 370 25
service 0 370 25
laws 0 370 25
we 0 370 25
have 0 370 25
to 0 370 25
adhere 0 370 25
to,” 0 370 25
said 0 370 25
Hall. 0 370 25

Apparently, 0 370 26
it 0 370 26
is 0 370 26
no 0 370 26
longer 0 370 26
against 0 370 26
the 0 370 26
law. 0 370 26

This 0 370 27
news 0 370 27
will 0 370 27
likely 0 370 27
be 0 370 27
well 0 370 27
received 0 370 27
by 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
Jean 0 370 27
family 0 370 27
as 0 370 27
well 0 370 27
as 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
activists 0 370 27
who 0 370 27
have 0 370 27
been 0 370 27
calling 0 370 27
for 0 370 27
justice 0 370 27
for 0 370 27
Botham 0 370 27
since 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
beginning. 0 370 27

As 0 370 28
TFTP 0 370 28
previously 0 370 28
reported, 0 370 28
the 0 370 28
idea 0 370 28
of 0 370 28
not 0 370 28
firing 0 370 28
Guyger 0 370 28
seemed 0 370 28
utterly 1 370 28
preposterous 1 370 28
as 0 370 28
she 0 370 28
admitted 0 370 28
to 0 370 28
doing 0 370 28
something 0 370 28
wrong. 0 370 28

While 0 370 29
controversy 0 370 29
swarms 0 370 29
the 0 370 29
case 0 370 29
of 0 370 29
why 0 370 29
she 0 370 29
may 0 370 29
have 0 370 29
killed 0 370 29
Jean, 0 370 29
there 0 370 29
is 0 370 29
no 0 370 29
doubt 0 370 29
that 0 370 29
she 0 370 29
did 0 370 29
kill 0 370 29
him. 0 370 29

This 0 370 30
is 0 370 30
a 0 370 30
fact. 0 370 30

This 0 370 31
public 0 370 31
servant 0 370 31
walked 0 370 31
into 0 370 31
an 0 370 31
innocent 1 370 31
man’s 0 370 31
home 0 370 31
and 0 370 31
shot 0 370 31
him 0 370 31
dead. 0 370 31

Because 0 370 32
of 0 370 32
her 0 370 32
actions, 0 370 32
this 0 370 32
man 0 370 32
no 0 370 32
longer 0 370 32
lives. 0 370 32

This 0 370 33
alone 0 370 33
should 0 370 33
have 0 370 33
been 0 370 33
enough 0 370 33
to 0 370 33
fire 0 370 33
her. 0 370 33

Surprisingly 0 370 34
enough, 0 370 34
NRA 0 370 34
spokesperson 0 370 34
Dana 0 370 34
Loesch 0 370 34
responded 0 370 34
to 0 370 34
the 0 370 34
firing 0 370 34
of 0 370 34
Guyger 0 370 34
with 0 370 34
one 0 370 34
word, 0 370 34
“Good,” 0 370 34
showing 0 370 34
her 0 370 34
support 0 370 34
for 0 370 34
the 0 370 34
move. 0 370 34

For 0 370 35
those 0 370 35
who 0 370 35
don’t 0 370 35
recall, 0 370 35
Loesch 0 370 35
sparked 0 370 35
controversy 0 370 35
earlier 0 370 35
this 0 370 35
month 0 370 35
by 0 370 35
claiming 0 370 35
that 0 370 35
if 0 370 35
Botham 0 370 35
Jean 0 370 35
were 0 370 35
a 0 370 35
gun 0 370 35
owner, 0 370 35
he 0 370 35
may 0 370 35
be 0 370 35
alive 0 370 35
today. 0 370 35

Indeed, 0 370 36
as 0 370 36
TFTP 0 370 36
reported 0 370 36
over 0 370 36
the 0 370 36
weekend, 0 370 36
a 0 370 36
father 0 370 36
in 0 370 36
Prince 0 370 36
George’s 0 370 36
County 0 370 36
opened 0 370 36
fire 0 370 36
on 0 370 36
officers 0 370 36
as 0 370 36
they 0 370 36
wrongly 0 370 36
entered 0 370 36
his 0 370 36
apartment. 0 370 36

He 0 370 37
shot 0 370 37
two 0 370 37
officers. 0 370 37

Not 0 370 38
only 0 370 38
was 0 370 38
he 0 370 38
not 0 370 38
arrested, 0 370 38
but 0 370 38
the 0 370 38
police 0 370 38
chief 0 370 38
praised 0 370 38
him 0 370 38
and 0 370 38
apologized. 0 370 38

In 0 370 39
response 0 370 39
to 0 370 39
Guyger’s 0 370 39
termination, 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
family’s 0 370 39
attorney, 0 370 39
Lee 0 370 39
Merritt 0 370 39
noted 0 370 39
that 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
family 0 370 39
expressed 0 370 39
“satisfaction” 0 370 39
with 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
move. 0 370 39

“The 0 370 40
Jean 0 370 40
family 0 370 40
expressed 0 370 40
satisfaction 0 370 40
in 0 370 40
this 0 370 40
explanation 0 370 40
and 0 370 40
in 0 370 40
Guyger’s 0 370 40
termination. 0 370 40

We 0 370 41
see 0 370 41
it 0 370 41
as 0 370 41
an 0 370 41
initial 0 370 41
victory 0 370 41
— 0 370 41

in 0 372 52

a 0 372 52

Ellison 0 372 54
subsequently 0 372 54
agreed 0 372 54
to 0 372 54
dismiss 0 372 54
his 0 372 54
restraining 0 372 54
order 0 372 54
against 0 372 54
her 0 372 54
if 0 372 54
she 0 372 54
no 0 372 54
longer 0 372 54
contacted 0 372 54
him. 0 372 54

I'm 0 372 55
not 0 372 55
sure 0 372 55
that 0 372 55
this 0 372 55
is 0 372 55
nothing 0 372 55
more 0 372 55
than 0 372 55
damage 0 372 55
control 0 372 55
just 0 372 55
before 0 372 55
the 0 372 55
elections. 0 372 55

Ellison 0 372 56
won 0 372 56
the 0 372 56
primary 0 372 56
days 0 372 56
after 0 372 56
the 0 372 56
allegations 0 372 56
were 0 372 56
made 0 372 56
public. 0 372 56

Of 0 372 57
course, 0 372 57
accusations 0 372 57
does 0 372 57
not 0 372 57
make 0 372 57
one 0 372 57
guilty 0 372 57
for 0 372 57
Ellison 0 372 57
anymore 0 372 57
than 0 372 57
they 0 372 57
do 0 372 57
for 0 372 57
Judge 0 372 57
Kavanaugh. 0 372 57

However, 0 372 58
at 0 372 58
least 0 372 58
in 0 372 58
the 0 372 58
case 0 372 58
of 0 372 58
Ellison, 0 372 58
at 0 372 58
least 0 372 58
one 0 372 58
of 0 372 58
the 0 372 58
women 0 372 58
were 0 372 58
not 0 372 58
scared 0 372 58
about 0 372 58
their 0 372 58
reputation 0 372 58
and 0 372 58
had 0 372 58
any 0 372 58
political 0 372 58
motive 0 372 58
to 0 372 58
call 0 372 58

police 0 372 58
and 0 372 58

When 0 372 59
it 0 372 59
comes 0 372 59
to 0 372 59
Ellison 0 372 59
though, 0 372 59

That 0 115 2

In 0 120 13

the 0 120 13

it 0 121 7

that 0 121 7

one 1 122 6
of 1 122 6
five 1 122 6
things. 1 122 6

One 1 122 7
– 1 122 7
the 1 122 7
easiest 1 122 7
one 1 122 7
maybe 1 122 7
– 1 122 7
chop 1 122 7
their 1 122 7
head 1 122 7
off, 1 122 7
that’s 1 122 7
the 1 122 7
easiest. 1 122 7

Second 1 122 8
– 1 122 8
burn 1 122 8
them 1 122 8
to 1 122 8
death. 1 122 8

Third 1 122 9
– 1 122 9
throw 1 122 9
’em 1 122 9
off 1 122 9
a 1 122 9
cliff. 1 122 9

– 1 122 10
tear 1 122 10
down 1 122 10
a 1 122 10
wall 1 122 10

at 0 129 20
Haig's 0 129 20
home 0 129 20
in 0 129 20

Haig 0 129 22

in 0 129 22
the 0 129 22

Paddock 0 129 23
bought 0 129 23

that 0 135 39
the 0 135 39
massacre 0 135 39
took 0 135 39

Nevertheless, 0 135 43
it's 0 135 43
hard 0 135 43
to 0 135 43
believe 0 135 43
that 0 135 43

He 0 139 23

He 0 139 24
asked 0 139 24
the 0 139 24
following, 0 139 24
“Did 0 139 24
you 0 139 24
hear 0 139 24

the 0 139 25
United 0 139 25

ridiculed?” 0 139 27
He 0 139 27
then 0 139 27
cited 0 139 27
the 0 139 27
Christian 0 139 27
and 0 139 27
Jewish 0 139 27
Bible, 0 139 27
barking 1 139 27
loudly, 0 139 27
“The 0 139 27

Mohamed 0 139 28
later 0 139 28
lamented 0 139 28
the 0 139 28
existence 0 139 28
of 0 139 28

He 0 139 29
decried, 0 139 29
“Listen. 0 139 29

communities.” 0 139 31
He 0 139 31
as 0 139 31
well 0 139 31
spoke 0 139 31
of 0 139 31
his 0 139 31
support 0 139 31
for 0 139 31
polygamy, 0 139 31
an 0 139 31
act 0 139 31
that 0 139 31
is 0 139 31
illegal 0 139 31
in 0 139 31
the 0 139 31
United 0 139 31

He 0 139 32
exclaimed, 0 139 32
“Here 0 139 32
the 0 139 32

is 0 409 3

What 0 413 9
kind 0 413 9
of 0 413 9
injustice? 0 413 9

Tlaib, 1 413 10
of 1 413 10
course, 1 413 10
had 1 413 10
nothing 1 413 10
to 1 413 10
say 1 413 10
about 1 413 10
the 1 413 10
genocidal 1 413 10
incitement 1 413 10
against 1 413 10
Jews 1 413 10
and 1 413 10
Israel 1 413 10
that 1 413 10
regularly 1 413 10
features 1 413 10
on 1 413 10
Palestinian 1 413 10
television. 1 413 10

She 0 413 11
did 0 413 11
say, 0 413 11
however, 0 413 11
that 0 413 11
she 0 413 11
favors 0 413 11
a 0 413 11
one-state, 0 413 11
not 0 413 11
two-state, 0 413 11
“solution” 0 413 11
to 0 413 11
the 0 413 11
Israeli-Palestinian 0 413 11
conflict: 0 413 11
“One 0 413 11
state. 0 413 11

It 0 413 12
has 0 413 12
to 0 413 12
be 0 413 12
one 0 413 12
state. 0 413 12

Separate 0 413 13
but 0 413 13
equal 0 413 13
does 0 413 13
not 0 413 13
work. 0 413 13

I’m 0 413 14
only 0 413 14
42 0 413 14
years 0 413 14
old 0 413 14
but 0 413 14
my 0 413 14
teachers 0 413 14
were 0 413 14
of 0 413 14
that 0 413 14
generation 0 413 14
that 0 413 14
marched 0 413 14
with 0 413 14
Martin 0 413 14
Luther 0 413 14
King. 0 413 14

This 0 413 15
whole 0 413 15
idea 0 413 15
of 0 413 15
a 0 413 15
two-state 0 413 15
solution, 0 413 15
it 1 413 15
doesn’t 1 413 15
work.” 1 413 15

Indeed 0 413 16
it 0 413 16
doesn’t. 0 413 16

A 0 413 17
Palestinian 0 413 17
state 0 413 17
would 0 413 17
be 0 413 17
a 0 413 17
new 0 413 17
base 0 413 17
for 0 413 17
renewed 0 413 17
jihad 0 413 17
attacks 0 413 17
against 0 413 17
Israel. 0 413 17

But 0 413 18
a 0 413 18
“one-state 0 413 18
solution” 0 413 18
would 0 413 18
be 0 413 18
even 0 413 18
worse, 0 413 18
unless 0 413 18
that 0 413 18
state 0 413 18
is 0 413 18
the 0 413 18
current 0 413 18
State 0 413 18
of 0 413 18
Israel, 0 413 18
but 0 413 18
that 0 413 18
is 0 413 18
not 0 413 18
the 0 413 18
one 0 413 18
state 0 413 18
Tlaib 0 413 18
has 0 413 18
in 0 413 18
mind. 0 413 18

She 0 413 19
is 0 413 19
calling 0 413 19
for 0 413 19
an 0 413 19
Israeli/Palestinian 0 413 19
state 0 413 19
that 0 413 19
would 0 413 19
not 0 413 19
be 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
Jewish 0 413 19
State 0 413 19
or 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
homeland 0 413 19
for 0 413 19
the 0 413 19
Jewish 0 413 19
people, 0 413 19
but 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
federation 0 413 19
in 0 413 19
which 0 413 19
Palestinians 0 413 19
would 0 413 19
soon 0 413 19
overwhelm 0 413 19
Jews 0 413 19
demographically. 0 413 19

Progressive 0 413 20
denial 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
their 0 413 20
rights 0 413 20
would 0 413 20
soon 0 413 20
follow: 0 413 20
as 0 413 20
I 0 413 20
show 0 413 20
in 0 413 20
my 0 413 20
book 0 413 20
The 0 413 20

From 0 413 20
Muhammad 0 413 20
to 0 413 20

there 0 413 20
has 0 413 20
never 0 413 20
been 0 413 20
a 0 413 20
majority 0 413 20
Muslim 0 413 20
nation 0 413 20
in 0 413 20
which 0 413 20

enjoyed 0 413 20
equality 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
rights 0 413 20
with 0 413 20
Muslims. 0 413 20

Tlaib’s 0 413 21
unitary 0 413 21
state 0 413 21
would 0 413 21
be 0 413 21
no 0 413 21
different. 0 413 21

The 0 413 22
hijabed 0 413 22
(and 0 413 22
therefore 0 413 22
pro-Sharia) 0 413 22
Ilhan 0 413 22
Omar, 0 413 22
meanwhile, 0 413 22
is 1 413 22
even 1 413 22
more 1 413 22

than 1 413 22
Tlaib. 1 413 22

According 0 413 23

in 0 413 23

Challenged 0 413 24
about 0 413 24
this 0 413 24
tweet 0 413 24
much 0 413 24
more 0 413 24
recently, 0 413 24
she 1 413 24
doubled 1 413 24
down 1 413 24
and 1 413 24
attacked 1 413 24
the 0 413 24
man 0 413 24
who 0 413 24
called 0 413 24
attention 0 413 24
to 0 413 24
the 0 413 24
tweet: 0 413 24
“Drawing 0 413 24

David 0 413 27
Steinberg 0 413 27
of 0 413 27
PJ 0 413 27
Media 0 413 27
has 0 413 27
done 0 413 27
extraordinary 1 413 27
work 1 413 27
in 0 413 27
shedding 0 413 27
light 0 413 27
on 0 413 27
aspects 0 413 27
of 0 413 27
Omar’s 0 413 27
record 0 413 27
that 0 413 27
the 0 413 27
establishment 0 413 27

has 0 413 27
steadfastly 1 413 27

Steinberg 0 413 28
reports 0 413 28
that 0 413 28
Omar 0 413 28
has 0 413 28
“faced 0 413 28
allegations 0 413 28
-- 0 413 28
soon 0 413 28
backed 0 413 28
by 0 413 28
a 0 413 28
remarkable 0 413 28
amount 0 413 28
of 0 413 28
evidence 0 413 28
-- 0 413 28
that 0 413 28
she 0 413 28
had 0 413 28
married 0 413 28
her 0 413 28
own 0 413 28
brother 0 413 28
in 0 413 28
2009, 0 413 28

was 0 413 28
still 0 413 28
legally 0 413 28
his 0 413 28
wife. 0 413 28

They 0 413 29
officially 0 413 29
divorced 0 413 29
in 0 413 29
December 0 413 29
2017. 0 413 29

The 0 413 30
motivation 0 413 30
for 0 413 30
the 0 413 30
marriage 0 413 30
remains 0 413 30
unclear. 0 413 30

However, 0 413 31
the 0 413 31
totality 0 413 31
of 0 413 31
the 0 413 31
evidence 0 413 31
points 0 413 31
to 0 413 31
possible 0 413 31
immigration 0 413 31

What’s 0 413 31
more, 0 413 31
she 0 413 31
swore 0 413 31
to 0 413 31
apparent 0 413 31
falsehoods 0 413 31
in 0 413 31
court. 0 413 31

But 0 413 32
Leftists 0 413 32
rarely 0 413 32
have 0 413 32
to 0 413 32
answer 0 413 32
for 0 413 32
their 0 413 32
corruption, 0 413 32
and 0 413 32
in 0 413 32
a 0 413 32
Democrat 0 413 32
House, 0 413 32
Omar 0 413 32
will 0 413 32
much 0 413 32
more 0 413 32
likely 0 413 32
be 0 413 32
celebrated 0 413 32
than 0 413 32
investigated. 0 413 32

She 0 413 33
and 0 413 33
Tlaib 0 413 33
will 0 413 33
enjoy 0 413 33
establishment 0 413 33

accolades 0 413 33
as 0 413 33
they 0 413 33
pursue 0 413 33
their 0 413 33
hard-Left, 0 413 33
anti-American, 0 413 33
anti-Israel 0 413 33
agenda. 0 413 33

Their 0 413 34
presence 0 413 34
in 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
House 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
Representatives 0 413 34
may 0 413 34
be 0 413 34
evidence 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
“diversity,” 0 413 34
but 0 413 34
it 0 413 34
is 0 413 34
also 0 413 34
a 0 413 34
disquieting 0 413 34
sign 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
continued 0 413 34
dominance 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
identity 0 413 34
politics, 0 413 34
and 0 413 34
the 1 413 34
increasing 1 413 34
balkanization 1 413 34
of 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
American 0 413 34

Forthrightly 1 413 35
pro-America, 1 413 35
pro-Israel 1 413 35
candidates 1 413 35
would 1 413 35
stand 1 413 35

And 1 413 35

that 1 413 35

is 1 413 35

indicative 1 413 35

of 1 413 35

a 1 413 35

wonderful 1 414 4
coincidence 1 414 4
of 1 414 4

problem 0 414 5
with 0 414 5
this 0 414 5
latest 0 414 5

that 0 414 5

I 0 414 14
feature 0 414 14
in 0 414 14
the 0 414 14

every 0 414 14

I 0 414 14
visited. 0 414 14

There 0 414 15
were 0 414 15
no 0 414 15
exceptions. 0 414 15

For 0 414 16
an 0 414 16
exception 0 414 16
to 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
made 0 414 16
for 0 414 16
Manafort 0 414 16
and 0 414 16
the 1 414 16
“Russians” 1 414 16
would 0 414 16
have 0 414 16
had 0 414 16
to 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
a 0 414 16
decision 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
Government 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
Ecuador, 0 414 16
not 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
Wikileaks, 0 414 16
and 0 414 16
that 0 414 16
would 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
so 0 414 16
exceptional 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
reason 0 414 16
for 0 414 16
it 0 414 16
would 0 414 16
surely 0 414 16
have 0 414 16
been 0 414 16
noted 0 414 16
in 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
now 0 414 16
leaked 0 414 16
supposed 0 414 16
Ecuadorean 0 414 16
“intelligence 0 414 16
report” 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
visits. 0 414 16

What 0 414 17
possible 0 414 17
motive 0 414 17
would 0 414 17
the 0 414 17
Ecuadorean 0 414 17
government 0 414 17
have 0 414 17

unrecorded 0 414 17
visits 0 414 17
by 0 414 17
Paul 0 414 17
Manafort? 0 414 17

Furthermore 0 414 18
it 0 414 18
is 0 414 18
impossible 0 414 18
that 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
intelligence 0 414 18
agency 0 414 18
– 0 414 18
who 0 414 18
were 0 414 18
in 0 414 18
charge 0 414 18
of 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
security 0 414 18
– 0 414 18
would 0 414 18
not 0 414 18
know 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
identity 0 414 18
of 0 414 18
these 0 414 18
alleged 0 414 18
“Russians”. 1 414 18

Previously 1 414 19
Harding 1 414 19
and 1 414 19
the 1 414 19
Guardian 1 414 19
have 1 414 19
published 1 414 19
documents 1 414 19
faked 1 414 19
by 1 414 19
the 1 414 19
Moreno 1 414 19
government 1 414 19
regarding 1 414 19
a 1 414 19
diplomatic 1 414 19
appointment 1 414 19
to 1 414 19
Russia 1 414 19
for 1 414 19
Assange 1 414 19
of 1 414 19
which 1 414 19
he 1 414 19
had 1 414 19
no 1 414 19
knowledge. 1 414 19

Now 1 414 20
they 1 414 20
follow 1 414 20
this 1 414 20
up 1 414 20
with 1 414 20
more 1 414 20
documents 1 414 20
aimed 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
provide 1 414 20
fictitious 1 414 20
evidence 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
bolster 1 414 20
Mueller’s 1 414 20
pathetically 1 414 20
failed 1 414 20
attempt 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
substantiate 1 414 20
the 1 414 20
story 1 414 20
that 1 414 20
Russia 1 414 20
deprived 1 414 20
Hillary 1 414 20
of 1 414 20
the 1 414 20
Presidency. 1 414 20

My 0 414 21
friend 0 414 21
William 0 414 21
Binney, 0 414 21
probably 1 414 21
the 1 414 21
world’s 1 414 21
greatest 1 414 21
expert 1 414 21
on 1 414 21
electronic 1 414 21
surveillance, 1 414 21
former 0 414 21
Technical 0 414 21
Director 0 414 21
of 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
NSA, 0 414 21
has 0 414 21
stated 0 414 21
that 0 414 21
it 0 414 21
is 0 414 21
impossible 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
DNC 0 414 21
servers 0 414 21
were 0 414 21
hacked, 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
technical 0 414 21
evidence 0 414 21
shows 0 414 21
it 0 414 21
was 0 414 21
a 0 414 21
download 0 414 21
to 0 414 21
a 0 414 21
directly 0 414 21
connected 0 414 21
memory 0 414 21
stick. 0 414 21

I 1 414 22
knew 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
US 1 414 22
security 1 414 22
services 1 414 22
were 1 414 22
conducting 1 414 22
a 1 414 22
fake 1 414 22
investigation 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
moment 1 414 22
it 1 414 22
became 1 414 22
clear 1 414 22
that 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
FBI 1 414 22
did 1 414 22
not 1 414 22
even 1 414 22
themselves 1 414 22
look 1 414 22
at 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
DNC 1 414 22
servers, 1 414 22
instead 1 414 22
accepting 1 414 22
a 1 414 22
report 1 414 22
from 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
Clinton 1 414 22
linked 1 414 22
DNC 1 414 22
“security 1 414 22
consultants” 1 414 22
Crowdstrike. 1 414 22

I 0 414 23
would 0 414 23
love 0 414 23
to 0 414 23
believe 0 414 23
that 0 414 23
the 0 414 23
fact 0 414 23
Julian 0 414 23
has 0 414 23
never 0 414 23
met 0 414 23
Manafort 0 414 23
is 0 414 23
bound 0 414 23
to 0 414 23
be 0 414 23
established. 0 414 23

But 1 414 24
I 1 414 24
fear 1 414 24
that 1 414 24
state 1 414 24
control 1 414 24
of 1 414 24
propaganda 1 414 24
may 1 414 24
be 1 414 24
such 1 414 24
that 1 414 24
this 1 414 24
massive 1 414 24
“Big 1 414 24
Lie” 1 414 24
will 1 414 24
come 1 414 24
to 1 414 24
enter 1 414 24
public 1 414 24
consciousness 1 414 24
in 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
same 1 414 24
way 1 414 24
as 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
non-existent 1 414 24
Russian 1 414 24
hack 1 414 24
of 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
DNC 1 414 24
servers. 1 414 24

Assange 1 414 25
never 1 414 25
met 1 414 25
Manafort. 1 414 25

The 1 414 26
DNC 1 414 26
emails 1 414 26
were 1 414 26
downloaded 1 414 26
by 1 414 26
an 1 414 26
insider. 1 414 26

Assange 1 414 27
never 1 414 27
even 1 414 27
considered 1 414 27
fleeing 1 414 27
to 1 414 27
Russia. 1 414 27

Those 1 414 28
are 1 414 28
the 1 414 28
facts, 1 414 28
and 1 414 28
I 1 414 28
am 1 414 28
in 1 414 28
a 1 414 28
position 1 414 28
to 1 414 28
give 1 414 28
you 1 414 28
a 1 414 28
personal 1 414 28
assurance 1 414 28
of 1 414 28
them. 1 414 28

I 1 414 29
can 1 414 29
also 1 414 29
assure 1 414 29
you 1 414 29
that 1 414 29
Luke 1 414 29
Harding, 1 414 29
the 1 414 29
Guardian, 1 414 29
Washington 1 414 29
Post 1 414 29
and 1 414 29
New 1 414 29
York 1 414 29
Times 1 414 29
have 1 414 29
been 1 414 29
publishing 1 414 29
a 1 414 29
stream 1 414 29
of 1 414 29
deliberate 1 414 29
lies, 1 414 29
in 1 414 29
collusion 1 414 29
with 1 414 29
the 1 414 29
security 1 414 29
services. 1 414 29

I 0 414 30
am 0 414 30
not 0 414 30
a 0 414 30
fan 0 414 30
of 0 414 30
Donald 0 414 30
Trump. 0 414 30

But 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
see 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
partisans 1 414 31
of 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
defeated 1 414 31
candidate 1 414 31
(and 1 414 31
a 1 414 31
particularly 1 414 31
obnoxious 1 414 31
defeated 1 414 31
candidate) 1 414 31
manipulate 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
security 1 414 31
services 1 414 31
and 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
media 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
create 1 414 31
an 1 414 31
entirely 1 414 31
false 1 414 31
public 1 414 31
perception, 1 414 31
in 1 414 31
order 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
attempt 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
overturn 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
result 1 414 31
of 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
US 1 414 31
Presidential 1 414 31
election, 1 414 31
is 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
most 1 414 31
astonishing 1 414 31
thing 1 414 31
I 1 414 31
have 1 414 31
witnessed 1 414 31
in 1 414 31
my 1 414 31
lifetime. 1 414 31

Plainly 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
government 1 414 32
of 1 414 32
Ecuador 1 414 32
is 1 414 32
releasing 1 414 32
lies 1 414 32
about 1 414 32
Assange 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
curry 1 414 32
favour 1 414 32
with 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
security 1 414 32
establishment 1 414 32
of 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
USA 1 414 32
and 1 414 32
UK, 1 414 32
and 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
damage 1 414 32
Assange’s 1 414 32
support 1 414 32
prior 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
expelling 1 414 32
him 1 414 32
from 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
Embassy. 1 414 32

He 1 414 33
will 1 414 33
then 1 414 33
be 1 414 33
extradited 1 414 33
from 1 414 33
London 1 414 33
to 1 414 33
the 1 414 33
USA 1 414 33
on 1 414 33
charges 1 414 33
of 1 414 33
espionage. 1 414 33

Assange 0 414 34
is 0 414 34
not 0 414 34
a 1 414 34
whistleblower 1 414 34
or 1 414 34
a 1 414 34
spy 1 414 34
– 0 414 34
he 0 414 34
is 0 414 34
the 1 414 34
greatest 1 414 34
publisher 1 414 34
of 1 414 34
his 1 414 34
age, 1 414 34
and 1 414 34
has 1 414 34
done 1 414 34
more 1 414 34
to 1 414 34
bring 1 414 34
the 1 414 34
crimes 1 414 34
of 1 414 34
governments 1 414 34
to 1 414 34
light 1 414 34
than 1 414 34
the 1 414 34
mainstream 1 414 34
media 1 414 34
will 1 414 34
ever 1 414 34
be 1 414 34
motivated 1 414 34
to 1 414 34
achieve. 1 414 34

That 1 414 35

why 0 416 17
are 0 416 17
Democrats 0 416 17
such 0 416 17
as 0 416 17
Keith 0 416 17

of 0 416 17
friendship 0 416 17

Farrakhan, 0 416 17
despite 0 416 17
the 0 416 17

he 0 416 17
tells 0 416 17

try 0 416 17

distance 0 416 17
himself 0 416 17

Farrakhan 0 416 17

Currently, 0 424 38
two 0 424 38
groups 0 424 38

according 0 424 38

6,500 0 424 38
people, 0 424 38

US 0 424 38
through 0 424 38

Meanwhile, 0 424 39
a 0 424 39
third 0 424 39
caravan 0 424 39
of 0 424 39
migrants, 0 424 39
this 0 424 39
time 0 424 39
from 0 424 39
El 0 424 39

has 0 424 39
reportedly 0 424 39
already 0 424 39
crossed 0 424 39

the 0 424 40

While 0 424 41
the 0 424 41

still 0 424 41
has 0 424 41
very 0 424 41

about 0 424 41

invalid 1 431 24
provisional 1 431 24
ballots 1 431 24
getting 1 431 24
mixed 1 431 24
in 1 431 24
with 1 431 24
valid 1 431 24
ones? 1 431 24

Maybe 1 431 25
a 1 431 25
little 1 431 25
electronic 1 431 25
voter 1 431 25
manipulation, 1 431 25
Ms. 1 431 25
Abrams? 1 431 25

How 1 431 26
about 1 431 26
non-citizens 1 431 26
and 1 431 26
illegal 1 431 26
aliens 1 431 26
voting, 1 431 26
Ms. 1 431 26
Abrams? 1 431 26

Are 0 431 27
these 0 431 27
evidence 0 431 27
of 0 431 27
the 0 431 27
erosion 0 431 27
of 0 431 27
the 0 431 27
democratic 0 431 27
process? 0 431 27

Sure 0 431 28
they 0 431 28
are 0 431 28
and 0 431 28
they 0 431 28
appear 0 431 28
to 0 431 28
all 0 431 28
be 0 431 28
coming 0 431 28
from 0 431 28
the 0 431 28
party 0 431 28
that 0 431 28
Stacey 0 431 28
Abrams 0 431 28
represents, 0 431 28
but 0 431 28
she's 0 431 28
not 0 431 28
going 0 431 28
to 0 431 28
talk 0 431 28
about 0 431 28
that. 0 431 28

But 0 431 29
she 0 431 29
wasn't 0 431 29
going 0 431 29
to 0 431 29
concede. 0 431 29

Nope, 0 431 30
that 0 431 30
arrogant 0 431 30
wanna-be 0 431 30
first 0 431 30
female 0 431 30
governor 0 431 30
of 0 431 30
Georgia 0 431 30
simply 0 431 30
would 0 431 30
not 0 431 30
bow 0 431 30
out 0 431 30
gracefully. 0 431 30

“To 0 431 31
watch 0 431 31
an 0 431 31
elected 0 431 31
official 0 431 31
who 0 431 31
claims 0 431 31
to 0 431 31
represent 0 431 31
the 0 431 31
people 0 431 31
in 0 431 31
this 0 431 31
state 0 431 31
baldly 1 431 31
pin 1 431 31
his 1 431 31
hopes 1 431 31
for 0 431 31
election 0 431 31
on 0 431 31
the 0 431 31
suppression 0 431 31
of 0 431 31
the 0 431 31
people’s 0 431 31
democratic 0 431 31
right 0 431 31
to 0 431 31
vote 0 431 31
has 0 431 31
been 0 431 31
truly 0 431 31
appalling,” 0 431 31
Abrams 0 431 31
said. 0 431 31

“So, 0 431 32
let’s 0 431 32
be 0 431 32
clear," 0 431 32
she 0 431 32
continued. 0 431 32

"This 0 431 33
is 0 431 33
not 0 431 33
a 0 431 33
speech 0 431 33
of 0 431 33
concession. 0 431 33

Because 0 431 34
concession 0 431 34
means 0 431 34
to 0 431 34
acknowledge 0 431 34
an 0 431 34
action 0 431 34
is 0 431 34
right, 0 431 34
true 0 431 34
or 0 431 34
proper. 0 431 34

As 0 431 35
a 0 431 35
woman 0 431 35
of 0 431 35
conscience 0 431 35
and 0 431 35
faith, 0 431 35
I 0 431 35
cannot 0 431 35
concede 0 431 35
that. 0 431 35

But 0 431 36
my 0 431 36
assessment 0 431 36
is 0 431 36
the 0 431 36
law 0 431 36
currently 0 431 36
allows 0 431 36
no 0 431 36
further 0 431 36
viable 0 431 36
remedy.” 0 431 36

No, 0 431 37
concession 0 431 37
means 0 431 37
"a 0 431 37
thing 0 431 37
that 0 431 37
is 0 431 37
granted, 0 431 37
especially 0 431 37
in 0 431 37
response 0 431 37
to 0 431 37
demands; 0 431 37
a 0 431 37
thing 0 431 37
conceded." 0 431 37

Abrams 0 431 38
was 0 431 38
easily 0 431 38
defeated 0 431 38
in 0 431 38
terms 0 431 38
of 0 431 38
votes. 0 431 38

She 0 431 39
was 0 431 39
the 0 431 39
one 0 431 39
trying 0 431 39
to 0 431 39
"find" 0 431 39
and 0 431 39
count 0 431 39
votes 0 431 39
remember? 0 431 39

She 0 431 40
is 0 431 40
the 0 431 40
one 0 431 40
claiming 0 431 40
there 0 431 40
was 0 431 40
cancellation 0 431 40
of 0 431 40
hundreds 0 431 40
of 0 431 40
thousands 0 431 40
of 0 431 40
voter 0 431 40
registrations. 0 431 40

Where 0 431 41
is 0 431 41
her 0 431 41
evidence? 0 431 41

She 0 431 42
has 0 431 42
none. 0 431 42

Stacey 0 431 43
Abrams 0 431 43
is 0 431 43
a 0 431 43
sore 0 431 43
loser 0 431 43
just 0 431 43
like 0 431 43
Hillary 0 431 43
Clinton 0 431 43
and 0 431 43
this 0 431 43
little 0 431 43
temper 0 431 43
tantrum 0 431 43
she 0 431 43
put 0 431 43
on 0 431 43
display 0 431 43
will 0 431 43
probably 0 431 43
sink 1 431 43
any 1 431 43
chances 1 431 43
she 0 431 43
may 0 431 43
have 0 431 43
had 0 431 43
in 0 431 43
the 0 431 43
future 0 431 43
to 0 431 43
run 0 431 43
again. 0 431 43

Good! 1 431 44

Thank 1 431 44

quickly 0 433 1
the 0 433 1
drive-by 0 433 1
media 0 433 1
and 0 433 1

with 0 433 1
their 0 433 1

over 0 433 1
the 0 433 1

that 0 433 1
was 0 433 1
enhanced, 0 433 1
not 0 433 1
doctored, 0 433 1
to 0 433 1
demonstrate 0 433 1
that 0 433 1
all 0 433 1

them 0 433 1

through 0 433 1

teeth? 1 433 1

Yep, 0 433 2
I 0 433 2
noticed 0 433 2
too, 0 433 2
and 0 433 2
now 0 433 2
they're 0 433 2
trying 0 433 2
to 0 433 2
move 0 433 2
on, 0 433 2
but 0 433 2
I'm 0 433 2
gonna 0 433 2
get 0 433 2
in 0 433 2
one 0 433 2
last 0 433 2

before 0 433 2
we 0 433 2

course, 0 433 3
Infowars' 0 433 3
Paul 0 433 3
Joseph 0 433 3
Watson 0 433 3
simply 0 433 3
enhanced 0 433 3
the 0 433 3
video 0 433 3
from 0 433 3
C-SPAN, 0 433 3
which 0 433 3
was 0 433 3
a 0 433 3

said 0 433 3
didn't 0 433 3
occur. 0 433 3

Watson 0 433 4
then 0 433 4
went 0 433 4
on 0 433 4
to 0 433 4
be 0 433 4
happy 0 433 4
that 0 433 4
President 0 433 4

him 0 433 4
up 0 433 4
on 0 433 4
his 0 433 4

neutral 0 433 30

checkers" 1 433 31
like 0 433 31
Snopes 0 433 31
simply 0 433 31
posted 0 433 31
an 0 433 31
Associated 0 433 31
Press 0 433 31
article, 0 433 31
which 0 433 31
clearly 0 433 31
biased 0 433 31
towards 0 433 31
indicating 0 433 31
the 0 433 31
video 0 433 31
was 0 433 31
"doctored" 0 433 31
by 0 433 31
saying 0 433 31
it 0 433 31
was 0 433 31
sped 0 433 31
up, 0 433 31
but 0 433 31
that's 0 433 31
not 0 433 31
doctoring. 0 433 31

Doctoring 0 433 32
is 0 433 32
when 0 433 32
you 0 433 32
manipulate 0 433 32
the 0 433 32
content 0 433 32
to 0 433 32
misconstrue 0 433 32
the 0 433 32
reality 0 433 32
of 0 433 32
what 0 433 32
took 0 433 32
place. 0 433 32

If 1 433 33
you 1 433 33
want 1 433 33
to 1 433 33
see 1 433 33
doctoring, 1 433 33
go 1 433 33
to 1 433 33
0:58 1 433 33
of 1 433 33
the 1 433 33
video 1 433 33
above, 1 433 33
and 1 433 33
don't 1 433 33
be 1 433 33
drinking 1 433 33
anything 1 433 33
when 1 433 33
you 1 433 33
do 1 433 33
because 1 433 33
it's 1 433 33
hilarious. 1 433 33

But 0 433 34
it 0 433 34
isn't 0 433 34
just 0 433 34
Snopes 0 433 34
or 0 433 34
Politifact 0 433 34
and 0 433 34
outlets 0 433 34
like 0 433 34
that. 0 433 34

Take, 0 433 35
for 0 433 35
instance, 0 433 35
websites 0 433 35
like 0 433 35
MediaBiasFactCheck.com, 0 433 35
whom 0 433 35
I 0 433 35
had 0 433 35
to 0 433 35
have 0 433 35
my 0 433 35
attorneys 0 433 35
send 0 433 35
a 0 433 35
letter 0 433 35
for 0 433 35
their 0 433 35
libel 0 433 35
and 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
didn't 0 433 35
just 0 433 35
correct 0 433 35
it, 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
removed 0 433 35
it 0 433 35
entirely 0 433 35
because 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
knew 0 433 35
I 0 433 35
was 0 433 35
two 0 433 35
days 0 433 35
away 0 433 35
from 0 433 35
filing 0 433 35
a 0 433 35
lawsuit 0 433 35
against 0 433 35
them. 0 433 35

MBFC 0 433 36
actually 0 433 36
called 0 433 36
CNN 0 433 36
"left 1 433 36
biased," 1 433 36
which 0 433 36
is 0 433 36
correct 0 433 36
but 0 433 36
followed 0 433 36
up 0 433 36
with: 0 433 36

Overall, 0 433 37
we 0 433 37
rate 0 433 37
CNN 0 433 37
left 0 433 37
biased 0 433 37
based 0 433 37
on 0 433 37
story 0 433 37
selection 0 433 37
that 0 433 37
often 0 433 37
favors 0 433 37
the 0 433 37
left. 0 433 37

We 0 433 38
rate 0 433 38
them 0 433 38
Mixed 0 433 38
for 0 433 38
factual 0 433 38
reporting 0 433 38
due 0 433 38
to 0 433 38
misinformation 0 433 38
and 0 433 38
failed 0 433 38
fact 0 433 38
checks 0 433 38
from 0 433 38
guests 0 433 38
and 0 433 38
pundits. 0 433 38

However, 0 433 39
CNN’s 0 433 39
straight 0 433 39
news 0 433 39
reporting 0 433 39
would 0 433 39
earn 0 433 39
a 0 433 39
High 0 433 39

Straight 0 433 41

You 1 433 42
must 1 433 42
be 1 433 42
kidding 1 433 42
me? 1 433 42

Did 0 433 43
David 0 433 43

not 0 433 43
watch 0 433 43

about 0 433 43

Cooper 0 433 43
just 0 433 43
sat 0 433 43
there 0 433 43
and 0 433 43
let 0 433 43
him 0 433 43
lie 1 433 43
to 0 433 43
the 0 433 43
American 1 433 43
people, 1 433 43
editing 0 433 43
the 0 433 43
video 0 433 43
to 0 433 43
not 0 433 43
even 0 433 43
show 0 433 43
the 0 433 43
point 0 433 43
of 0 433 43

in 0 433 43
question? 0 433 43

Why 0 433 44
yes, 0 433 44
yes, 0 433 44
he 0 433 44
did! 0 433 44

Not 0 433 45
only 0 433 45
that 0 433 45
but 0 433 45
it 0 433 45
appears 0 433 45
the 0 433 45
MBFC 0 433 45
doesn't 0 433 45
know 0 433 45
the 0 433 45
documented 0 433 45
history 0 433 45
of 0 433 45
CNN's 0 433 45
complete 0 433 45
fabrication 0 433 45
of 0 433 45
"news," 0 433 45
telling 0 433 45
stories 0 433 45
that 0 433 45
never 0 433 45
happened. 0 433 45

MBFC 0 433 46
isn't 0 433 46
qualified 0 433 46
to 0 433 46
comment 0 433 46
on 0 433 46
the 0 433 46
subject. 0 433 46

It 0 433 47
isn't 0 433 47
just 0 433 47
MBFC 0 433 47
though. 0 433 47

Newcomer 0 433 48
NewsGuard 0 433 48
also 0 433 48
covers 0 433 48
for 0 433 48
CNN. 0 433 48

This 0 433 49
is 0 433 49
supposed 0 433 49
to 0 433 49
be 0 433 49
an 0 433 49
outlet, 0 433 49
at 0 433 49
least 0 433 49
what 0 433 49
I 0 433 49
was 0 433 49
told 0 433 49
in 0 433 49
email 0 433 49
and 0 433 49
phone 0 433 49
communication, 0 433 49
that 0 433 49
is 0 433 49
simply 0 433 49
to 0 433 49
determine 0 433 49
transparency 0 433 49
of 0 433 49
websites. 0 433 49

Instead, 0 433 50
they 0 433 50
not 0 433 50
only 0 433 50
do 0 433 50
that, 0 433 50
but 0 433 50
they 0 433 50
go 0 433 50
on 0 433 50
to 0 433 50
do 0 433 50
far 0 433 50
more 0 433 50
than 0 433 50
that. 0 433 50

In 0 433 51
rating 0 433 51
CNN, 0 433 51
NewsGuard 0 433 51
posts 0 433 51
this 0 433 51
nonsense. 1 433 51

I'm 0 433 52
sure 0 433 52
NewsGuard, 0 433 52
Yemile 0 433 52
Bucay, 0 433 52
Anna-Sophie 0 433 52
Harling 0 433 52
and 0 433 52
Amy 0 433 52
Westfeldt 0 433 52
need 0 433 52
to 0 433 52
update 0 433 52
this 0 433 52
in 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
light 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
obvious 0 433 52
lies 1 433 52
and 0 433 52
editing 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
Acosta 0 433 52
video 0 433 52
and 0 433 52
decades 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
documented, 0 433 52
outright 1 433 52
lies 1 433 52
and 0 433 52
propaganda 1 433 52
by 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
Clown 1 433 52
News 1 433 52
Network, 1 433 52
but 0 433 52
you 0 433 52
can't 0 433 52
expect 0 433 52
real 0 433 52
transparency 0 433 52
from 0 433 52
an 0 433 52
outlet 0 433 52
like 0 433 52
Newsguard 0 433 52
whose 0 433 52
writers 0 433 52
aren't 0 433 52
transparent 0 433 52
about 0 433 52
their 0 433 52
own 0 433 52
political 0 433 52
bias, 0 433 52
can 0 433 52
you? 0 433 52

Nope, 0 433 53
you 1 433 53
can't, 1 433 53
and 0 433 53
you 1 433 53
can't 1 433 53
expect 0 433 53
it 0 433 53
when 0 433 53
some 0 433 53
of 0 433 53
those 0 433 53
writers 0 433 53
write 0 433 53
for 0 433 53
other 0 433 53
publications 0 433 53
that 0 433 53
don't 0 433 53
measure 0 433 53
up 0 433 53
to 0 433 53
NewsGuard's 0 433 53
standards 0 433 53
either. 0 433 53

The 0 433 54
reason 0 433 54
this 0 433 54
little 0 433 54
incident 0 433 54
shouldn't 0 433 54
be 0 433 54
let 0 433 54
go 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
so 0 433 54
soon 0 433 54
is 0 433 54
that 0 433 54
it 0 433 54
is 0 433 54
one 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
the 0 433 54
clearest 0 433 54
demonstrations 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
the 0 433 54
media's 0 433 54
bias, 0 433 54
which 0 433 54
we 0 433 54
all 0 433 54
have, 0 433 54
lies 1 433 54
and 0 433 54
propaganda. 1 433 54

It 0 433 55
should 0 433 55
be 0 433 55
used 0 433 55
over 0 433 55
and 0 433 55
over 0 433 55
in 0 433 55
article 0 433 55
after 0 433 55
article 0 433 55
to 0 433 55
remind 0 433 55
people 0 433 55
about 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
total 1 433 55
dishonesty 1 433 55
and 0 433 55
complete 1 433 55
disregard 1 433 55
for 0 433 55
reporting 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
facts 0 433 55
by 0 433 55
outlets 0 433 55
such 0 433 55
as 0 433 55
CNN 0 433 55
and 0 433 55
to 0 433 55
not 0 433 55
blindly 0 433 55
trust 0 433 55
self-proclaimed 1 433 55
fact-checkers 1 433 55
who 0 433 55
will 0 433 55
not 0 433 55
tell 0 433 55
you 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
truth 0 433 55
either. 0 433 55

CNN 0 433 56
has 0 433 56
lost 1 433 56
its 1 433 56
mind 1 433 56
to 0 433 56
the 0 433 56
point 0 433 56
that 0 433 56
they 0 433 56
are 0 433 56
suing 0 433 56
over 0 433 56
Acosta 0 433 56
losing 0 433 56
his 0 433 56
press 0 433 56
pass. 0 433 56

He 1 433 57
was 1 433 57
their 1 433 57
inside 1 433 57
boy, 1 433 57
after 0 433 57
all. 0 433 57

But 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
real 0 433 58
irony 0 433 58
here 0 433 58
is 0 433 58
that 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
media 0 433 58
labeled 0 433 58
Paul 0 433 58
Joseph 0 433 58
Watson 0 433 58
and 0 433 58
Infowars 0 433 58
as 0 433 58
"conspiracy 1 433 58
theorists" 1 433 58
and 0 433 58
yet, 0 433 58
PJW 0 433 58
has 0 433 58
exposed 0 433 58
their 0 433 58
blatant 1 433 58
conspiracy 1 433 58
to 0 433 58
smear 0 433 58
President 0 433 58
Trump, 0 433 58
Sarah 0 433 58
Sanders 0 433 58
and 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
White 0 433 58
House 0 433 58
aide. 0 433 58

And 0 433 59
Jim 0 433 59
Acosta 0 433 59
believes 0 433 59
he 0 433 59
and 0 433 59
CNN 0 433 59
deal 0 433 59
with 0 433 59
facts 0 433 59
and 0 433 59
Infowars 0 433 59
doesn't. 0 433 59

Yeah, 0 433 60
right! 0 433 60

I'm 0 433 61
sorry 0 433 61
Jim, 0 433 61
I 0 433 61
can't 0 433 61

this 0 434 43

isn’t 0 441 2
exactly 0 441 2
a 0 441 2
grave 1 441 2
hardship. 1 441 2

It 0 441 3
just 0 441 3
means 0 441 3
Acosta 0 441 3
would 0 441 3
need 0 441 3

interview 0 441 5
that 0 441 5
aired 0 441 5
Sunday, 0 441 5
Trump 0 441 5
had 0 441 5
some 0 441 5
new 0 441 5
ideas 0 441 5
on 0 441 5
how 0 441 5
to 0 441 5
deal 0 441 5
with 0 441 5
Acosta, 0 441 5
who 0 441 5

with 0 441 5
him 0 441 5
during 0 441 5

"I 0 441 6
think 0 441 6
one 0 441 6
of 0 441 6
the 0 441 6
things 0 441 6
we’ll 0 441 6
do 0 441 6
is 0 441 6
maybe 0 441 6
turn 0 441 6
the 0 441 6
camera 0 441 6
off 0 441 6
that 0 441 6
faces 0 441 6
them, 0 441 6
because 0 441 6
then 0 441 6
they 0 441 6
don’t 0 441 6
have 0 441 6
any 0 441 6
air 0 441 6
time, 0 441 6
although 0 441 6
I’ll 0 441 6
probably 0 441 6
be 0 441 6
sued 0 441 6
for 0 441 6
that 0 441 6
and 0 441 6
maybe, 0 441 6
you 0 441 6
know, 0 441 6
win 0 441 6
or 0 441 6
lose 0 441 6
it, 0 441 6
who 0 441 6
knows," 0 441 6

"I 0 441 7
mean, 0 441 7
with 0 441 7
this 0 441 7

never 0 441 7
know 0 441 7
what’s 0 441 7
going 0 441 7
to 0 441 7
happen." 0 441 7

The 0 441 8
president 0 441 8
described 0 441 8
Acosta 0 441 8
as 0 441 8
"unbelievably 1 441 8

his 0 441 8
administration 0 441 8
is 0 441 8

"And 0 441 9
if 1 441 9
he 1 441 9
misbehaves, 1 441 9
we’ll 1 441 9
throw 1 441 9
him 1 441 9
out 1 441 9

Acosta’s 0 441 10
hard 0 441 10
pass 0 441 10
was 0 441 10
pulled 0 441 10
after 0 441 10
a 0 441 10
contentious 0 441 10
Nov. 0 441 10
7 0 441 10

After 0 441 11
interacting 0 441 11
with 0 441 11
President 0 441 11
Trump 0 441 11
– 0 441 11
Acosta 0 441 11
said 0 441 11
he 0 441 11
wanted 0 441 11
to 0 441 11
“challenge” 0 441 11
him 0 441 11
on 0 441 11
calling 0 441 11
the 0 441 11
Central 0 441 11
American 0 441 11

an 0 441 11
“invasion” 1 441 11
– 0 441 11
the 0 441 11
president 0 441 11
called 0 441 11
upon 0 441 11
another 0 441 11
reporter 0 441 11
to 0 441 11
speak. 0 441 11

After 0 441 12
lecturing 0 441 12
Trump, 0 441 12
Acosta 0 441 12
belligerently 1 441 12
refused 0 441 12
to 0 441 12
yield 0 441 12
the 0 441 12
microphone 0 441 12
to 0 441 12
a 0 441 12
White 0 441 12
House 0 441 12
staffer 0 441 12
and 0 441 12
pushed 0 441 12
her 0 441 12
arm 0 441 12
away 0 441 12
as 0 441 12
she 0 441 12
reached 0 441 12
for 0 441 12
the 0 441 12
device, 0 441 12
all 0 441 12
of 0 441 12
which 0 441 12
was 0 441 12
captured 0 441 12
on 0 441 12

On 0 441 13
Nov. 0 441 13
16, 0 441 13
U.S. 0 441 13
District 0 441 13
Judge 0 441 13
Timothy 0 441 13
J. 0 441 13
Kelly 0 441 13
of 0 441 13
Washington, 0 441 13
D.C., 0 441 13
who 0 441 13
was 0 441 13
appointed 0 441 13
by 0 441 13
Trump, 0 441 13
ruled 0 441 13
against 0 441 13
the 0 441 13
administration 0 441 13
and 0 441 13
ordered 0 441 13
Acosta’s 0 441 13
hard 0 441 13
pass 0 441 13
restored 0 441 13
for 0 441 13
14 0 441 13
days, 0 441 13
pending 0 441 13
further 0 441 13
hearings 0 441 13
in 0 441 13
the 0 441 13
lawsuit. 0 441 13

But 0 441 14
it 0 441 14
was 0 441 14
not 0 441 14
a 0 441 14
vindication 0 441 14
of 0 441 14
Acosta’s 0 441 14
free 0 441 14

rights 0 441 14
under 0 441 14
the 0 441 14
First 0 441 14
Amendment. 0 441 14

The 0 441 15
judge 0 441 15
specifically 0 441 15
said 0 441 15
that 0 441 15
the 0 441 15
First 0 441 15
Amendment 0 441 15
claim 0 441 15
made 0 441 15
by 0 441 15
Acosta 0 441 15
and 0 441 15
CNN 0 441 15
had 0 441 15
not 0 441 15
yet 0 441 15
been 0 441 15
adjudicated 0 441 15
and 0 441 15
added 0 441 15
that 0 441 15
the 0 441 15
president 0 441 15
was 0 441 15
free 0 441 15
not 0 441 15
to 0 441 15
call 0 441 15
on 0 441 15
Acosta 0 441 15
at 0 441 15
future 0 441 15
press 0 441 15
conferences. 0 441 15

The 0 441 16
temporary 0 441 16
restraining 0 441 16
order 0 441 16
was 0 441 16
nowhere 0 441 16
to 0 441 16
be 0 441 16
found 0 441 16
online 0 441 16
at 0 441 16

time, 0 441 16
but 0 441 16
according 0 441 16
to 0 441 16
media 0 441 16
reports, 0 441 16
Kelly 0 441 16
found 0 441 16
that 0 441 16
the 0 441 16
administration 0 441 16
violated 0 441 16
Acosta’s 0 441 16
due 0 441 16
process 0 441 16

under 0 441 16

The 0 441 17
White 0 441 17

vowed 0 441 17
to 0 441 17
remedy 0 441 17
the 0 441 17
situation 0 441 17
by 0 441 17

The 0 441 18
U.S. 0 441 18
Department 0 441 18

Justice 0 441 18
said 0 441 18
the 0 441 18
court 0 441 18
ruling 0 441 18
was 0 441 18
disappointing. 1 441 18

“The 0 441 19

Acosta 0 441 21
ignorantly 1 441 21
blathered 1 441 21
on 0 441 21
to 0 441 21
reporters 0 441 21
when 0 441 21
he 0 441 21

the 0 441 21
White 0 441 21

Friday 0 441 21
after 0 441 21
the 0 441 21
court 0 441 21
ruling, 0 441 21
incorrectly 0 441 21
claiming 0 441 21

Faced 1 442 3
with 1 442 3
the 1 442 3
backlash, 1 442 3
the 1 442 3
Guardian 1 442 3
quickly 1 442 3
– 1 442 3
and 1 442 3
very 1 442 3
quietly 1 442 3
– 1 442 3
rowed 1 442 3
back 1 442 3

Instead, 1 442 4
it 1 442 4

without 1 442 4

to 0 442 6
provide 0 442 6
evidence 0 442 6
for 0 442 6
long-standing 0 442 6
allegations 0 442 6
that 0 442 6

The 1 442 7
Guardian’s 1 442 7
latest 1 442 7
story 1 442 7
provides 1 442 7
a 1 442 7
supposedly 1 442 7
stronger 1 442 7
foundation 1 442 7
for 1 442 7
an 1 442 7
existing 1 442 7
narrative: 1 442 7
that 1 442 7
Assange 1 442 7
and 1 442 7
Wikileaks 1 442 7
knowingly 1 442 7
published 1 442 7
emails 1 442 7
hacked 1 442 7
by 1 442 7
Russia 1 442 7
from 1 442 7
the 1 442 7
Democratic 1 442 7
party’s 1 442 7
servers. 1 442 7

In 1 442 8
truth, 1 442 8
there 1 442 8
is 1 442 8
no 1 442 8
public 1 442 8
evidence 1 442 8
that 1 442 8
the 1 442 8
emails 1 442 8
were 1 442 8
hacked, 1 442 8
or 1 442 8
that 1 442 8
Russia 1 442 8
was 1 442 8
involved. 1 442 8

Central 1 442 9
actors 1 442 9
have 1 442 9
suggested 1 442 9
instead 1 442 9
that 1 442 9
the 1 442 9
emails 1 442 9
were 1 442 9
leaked 1 442 9
from 1 442 9
within 1 442 9
the 1 442 9
Democratic 1 442 9
party. 1 442 9

Nonetheless, 0 442 10
this 0 442 10
unverified 0 442 10
allegation 0 442 10
has 0 442 10
been 0 442 10
aggressively 1 442 10
exploited 1 442 10
by 0 442 10
the 0 442 10
Democratic 0 442 10
leadership 0 442 10
because 0 442 10
it 0 442 10
shifts 0 442 10
attention 0 442 10
away 0 442 10
both 0 442 10
from 0 442 10
its 0 442 10
failure 0 442 10
to 0 442 10
mount 0 442 10
an 0 442 10
effective 0 442 10
electoral 0 442 10
challenge 0 442 10
to 0 442 10
Trump 0 442 10
and 0 442 10
from 0 442 10
the 0 442 10
damaging 0 442 10
contents 0 442 10
of 0 442 10
the 0 442 10
emails. 0 442 10

These 0 442 11
show 0 442 11
that 0 442 11
party 0 442 11
bureaucrats 0 442 11
sought 0 442 11
to 0 442 11
rig 0 442 11
the 0 442 11
primaries 0 442 11
to 0 442 11
make 0 442 11
sure 0 442 11
Clinton’s 0 442 11
challenger 0 442 11
for 0 442 11
the 0 442 11
Democratic 0 442 11
nomination, 0 442 11
Bernie 0 442 11
Sanders, 0 442 11
lost. 0 442 11

To 0 442 12
underscore 0 442 12
the 0 442 12
intended 0 442 12
effect 0 442 12
of 0 442 12
the 0 442 12
Guardian’s 0 442 12
new 0 442 12
claims, 0 442 12
Harding 0 442 12
even 0 442 12
throws 0 442 12
in 0 442 12
a 0 442 12
casual 0 442 12
and 0 442 12
unsubstantiated 0 442 12
reference 0 442 12
to 0 442 12
“Russians” 1 442 12
joining 0 442 12
Manafort 0 442 12
in 0 442 12
supposedly 0 442 12
meeting 0 442 12
Assange. 0 442 12

Manafort 0 442 13
has 0 442 13
denied 0 442 13
the 0 442 13
Guardian’s 0 442 13
claims, 0 442 13
while 0 442 13
Assange 0 442 13
has 0 442 13
threatened 0 442 13
to 0 442 13
sue 0 442 13
the 0 442 13
Guardian 0 442 13
for 0 442 13
libel. 0 442 13

‘Responsible 0 442 14
for 0 442 14
Trump’ 0 442 14

The 0 442 15
emotional 0 442 15
impact 0 442 15
of 0 442 15
the 0 442 15
Guardian 0 442 15
story 0 442 15
is 0 442 15
to 0 442 15
suggest 0 442 15
that 0 442 15
Assange 0 442 15
is 0 442 15
responsible 0 442 15
for 0 442 15
four 0 442 15
years 0 442 15
or 0 442 15
more 0 442 15
of 0 442 15
Trump 0 442 15
rule. 0 442 15

But 0 442 16
more 0 442 16
significantly, 0 442 16
it 0 442 16
bolsters 0 442 16
the 0 442 16
otherwise 0 442 16
risible 0 442 16
claim 0 442 16
that 0 442 16
Assange 0 442 16
is 0 442 16
not 0 442 16
a 0 442 16
publisher 0 442 16
– 0 442 16
and 0 442 16
thereby 0 442 16
entitled 0 442 16
to 0 442 16
the 0 442 16
protections 0 442 16
of 0 442 16
a 0 442 16
free 0 442 16
press, 0 442 16
as 0 442 16
enjoyed 0 442 16
by 0 442 16
the 0 442 16
Guardian 0 442 16
or 0 442 16
the 0 442 16
New 0 442 16
York 0 442 16
Times 0 442 16
– 0 442 16
but 0 442 16
the 1 442 16
head 1 442 16
of 1 442 16
an 1 442 16
organisation 1 442 16
engaged 1 442 16
in 1 442 16
espionage 1 442 16
for 1 442 16
a 1 442 16
foreign 1 442 16
power. 1 442 16

The 0 442 17
intention 0 442 17
is 0 442 17
to 0 442 17
deeply 0 442 17
discredit 0 442 17
Assange, 0 442 17
and 0 442 17
by 0 442 17
extension 0 442 17
the 0 442 17
Wikileaks 0 442 17
organisation, 0 442 17
in 0 442 17
the 0 442 17
eyes 0 442 17
of 0 442 17
right-thinking 0 442 17
liberals. 0 442 17

That, 0 442 18
in 0 442 18
turn, 0 442 18
will 0 442 18
make 0 442 18
it 0 442 18
much 0 442 18
easier 0 442 18
to 0 442 18
silence 0 442 18
Assange 0 442 18
and 0 442 18
the 0 442 18
vital 0 442 18
cause 0 442 18
he 0 442 18
represents: 0 442 18
the 0 442 18
use 0 442 18
of 0 442 18

to 0 442 18

The 0 442 19
Guardian 0 442 19
story 0 442 19
will 0 442 19
prepare 0 442 19
public 0 442 19
opinion 0 442 19
for 0 442 19
the 0 442 19
moment 0 442 19
when 0 442 19
Ecuador’s 0 442 19

under 0 442 19
President 0 442 19

Assange 0 442 19
out 0 442 19
of 0 442 19
the 0 442 19
embassy, 0 442 19
having 0 442 19
already 0 442 19
withdrawn 0 442 19
most 0 442 19
of 0 442 19
his 0 442 19
rights 0 442 19
to 0 442 19
use 0 442 19
digital 0 442 19

It 0 442 20
will 0 442 20
soften 0 442 20
opposition 0 442 20
when 0 442 20
the 0 442 20

the 0 442 20

it 0 442 21
will 0 442 21
pave 0 442 21

avoiding 0 442 22
this 0 442 22

Assange 0 442 22

that 1 442 23

– 1 442 23

have 0 442 25

The 1 442 28
problem 1 442 28
for 1 442 28

which 1 442 28
should 1 442 28
have 1 442 28
been 1 442 28
obvious 1 442 28
to 1 442 28
its 1 442 28
editors 1 442 28
from 1 442 28
the 1 442 28
outset, 1 442 28
is 1 442 28
that 1 442 28
any 1 442 28
visits 1 442 28
by 1 442 28
Manafort 1 442 28
would 1 442 28
be 1 442 28
easily 1 442 28
verifiable 1 442 28
without 1 442 28
relying 1 442 28
on 1 442 28

far 0 442 29
from 0 442 29
alone 0 442 29
in 0 442 29
noting 0 442 29
that 0 442 29
London 0 442 29
is 0 442 29
possibly 0 442 29
the 0 442 29

environs 0 442 30
of 0 442 30
the 0 442 30
Ecuadorian 0 442 30
embassy 0 442 30
are 0 442 30
monitored 0 442 30
especially 0 442 30
heavily, 0 442 30
with 0 442 30
continuous 0 442 30
filming 0 442 30
by 0 442 30
the 0 442 30
UK 0 442 30
and 0 442 30
Ecuadorian 0 442 30
authorities 0 442 30
and 0 442 30
most 0 442 30
likely 0 442 30
by 0 442 30
the 0 442 30
US 0 442 30
and 0 442 30
other 0 442 30
actors 0 442 30
with 0 442 30
an 0 442 30
interest 0 442 30
in 0 442 30
Assange’s 0 442 30
fate. 0 442 30

The 0 442 31
idea 0 442 31
that 0 442 31
Manafort 0 442 31
or 0 442 31
“Russians” 1 442 31
could 0 442 31
have 0 442 31
wandered 0 442 31
into 0 442 31
the 0 442 31
embassy 0 442 31
to 0 442 31
meet 0 442 31
Assange 0 442 31
even 0 442 31
once 0 442 31
without 0 442 31
their 0 442 31
trail, 0 442 31
entry 0 442 31
and 0 442 31
meeting 0 442 31
being 0 442 31
intimately 0 442 31
scrutinised 0 442 31
and 0 442 31
recorded 0 442 31
is 0 442 31
simply 1 442 31
preposterous. 1 442 31

According 1 442 32
to 1 442 32
Greenwald: 1 442 32
“If 1 442 32
Paul 1 442 32
Manafort 1 442 32
… 1 442 32
visited 1 442 32
Assange 1 442 32
at 1 442 32
the 1 442 32
Embassy, 1 442 32
there 1 442 32
would 1 442 32
be 1 442 32
ample 1 442 32
amounts 1 442 32
of 1 442 32
video 1 442 32
and 1 442 32
other 1 442 32
photographic 1 442 32
proof 1 442 32
demonstrating 1 442 32
that 1 442 32
this 1 442 32
happened. 1 442 32

The 1 442 33
Guardian 1 442 33
provides 1 442 33
none 1 442 33
of 1 442 33
that.” 1 442 33

British 0 442 34
ambassador 0 442 34
Craig 0 442 34
Murray 0 442 34

out 0 442 34
the 0 442 34

on 0 442 34
by 0 442 34
the 0 442 34
embassy 0 442 34
to 0 442 34
which 0 442 34
any 0 442 34
visitor 0 442 34
to 0 442 34
Assange 0 442 34
must 0 442 34
submit. 0 442 34

Any 0 442 35
visits 0 442 35
by 0 442 35
Manafort 0 442 35
would 0 442 35
have 0 442 35
been 0 442 35
logged. 0 442 35

In 1 442 36
fact, 1 442 36
the 1 442 36
Guardian 1 442 36
obtained 1 442 36
the 1 442 36
embassy’s 1 442 36
logs 1 442 36
in 1 442 36
May, 1 442 36
and 1 442 36
has 1 442 36
never 1 442 36
made 1 442 36
any 1 442 36
mention 1 442 36

either 1 442 36
Manafort 1 442 36

“Russians” 1 442 36
being 1 442 36
identified 1 442 36
in 1 442 36
them. 1 442 36

It 1 442 37
did 1 442 37
not 1 442 37
refer 1 442 37
to 1 442 37
the 1 442 37
logs 1 442 37
in 1 442 37
its 1 442 37
latest 1 442 37
story. 1 442 37

Murray: 0 442 38

The 0 442 39
problem 0 442 39
with 0 442 39
this 1 442 39
latest 1 442 39
fabrication 1 442 39
is 0 442 39
that 0 442 39
[Ecuador’s 0 442 39
President] 0 442 39
Moreno 0 442 39
had 0 442 39
already 0 442 39
released 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
visitor 0 442 39
logs 0 442 39
to 0 442 39
the 0 442 39
Mueller 0 442 39
inquiry. 0 442 39

Neither 0 442 40
Manafort 0 442 40
nor 0 442 40
these 0 442 40
“Russians” 1 442 40
are 0 442 40
in 0 442 40
the 0 442 40
visitor 0 442 40
logs 0 442 40
… 0 442 40
What 0 442 40
possible 0 442 40
motive 0 442 40
would 0 442 40
the 0 442 40
Ecuadorean 0 442 40
government 0 442 40
have 0 442 40
for 0 442 40
facilitating 0 442 40
secret 0 442 40
unrecorded 0 442 40
visits 0 442 40
by 0 442 40
Paul 0 442 40
Manafort? 0 442 40

Furthermore 0 442 41
it 0 442 41
is 0 442 41
impossible 0 442 41
that 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
intelligence 0 442 41
agency 0 442 41
– 0 442 41
who 0 442 41
were 0 442 41
in 0 442 41
charge 0 442 41
of 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
security 0 442 41
– 0 442 41
would 0 442 41
not 0 442 41
know 0 442 41
the 0 442 41
identity 0 442 41
of 0 442 41
these 0 442 41
alleged 0 442 41
“Russians”. 1 442 41

No 1 442 42
fact-checking 1 442 42

It 1 442 43
is 1 442 43
worth 1 442 43
noting 1 442 43
it 1 442 43
should 1 442 43
be 1 442 43
vitally 1 442 43
important 1 442 43
for 1 442 43
a 1 442 43
serious 1 442 43
publication 1 442 43
like 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
Guardian 1 442 43
to 1 442 43
ensure 1 442 43
its 1 442 43
claims 1 442 43
are 1 442 43
unassailably 1 442 43
true 1 442 43
– 1 442 43
both 1 442 43
because 1 442 43
Assange’s 1 442 43
personal 1 442 43
fate 1 442 43
rests 1 442 43
on 1 442 43
their 1 442 43
veracity, 1 442 43
and 1 442 43
because, 1 442 43
even 1 442 43
more 1 442 43
importantly, 1 442 43
a 1 442 43
fundamental 1 442 43
right, 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
freedom 1 442 43
of 1 442 43
the 1 442 43
press, 1 442 43
is 1 442 43
at 1 442 43
stake. 1 442 43

Given 1 442 44
this, 1 442 44
one 1 442 44
would 1 442 44
have 1 442 44
expected 1 442 44
the 1 442 44
Guardian’s 1 442 44
editors 1 442 44
to 1 442 44
have 1 442 44
insisted 1 442 44
on 1 442 44
the 1 442 44
most 1 442 44
stringent 1 442 44
checks 1 442 44
imaginable 1 442 44
before 1 442 44
going 1 442 44
to 1 442 44
press 1 442 44
with 1 442 44
Harding’s 1 442 44
story. 1 442 44

At 1 442 45
a 1 442 45
very 1 442 45
minimum, 1 442 45
they 1 442 45
should 1 442 45
have 1 442 45
sought 1 442 45
out 1 442 45
a 1 442 45
response 1 442 45
from 1 442 45
Assange 1 442 45
and 1 442 45
Manafort 1 442 45
before 1 442 45
publication. 1 442 45

Neither 1 442 46
precaution 1 442 46
was 1 442 46
taken. 1 442 46

I 1 442 47
worked 1 442 47
for 1 442 47
the 1 442 47
Guardian 1 442 47
for 1 442 47
a 1 442 47
number 1 442 47
of 1 442 47
years, 1 442 47
and 1 442 47
know 1 442 47
well 1 442 47
the 1 442 47
layers 1 442 47
of 1 442 47
checks 1 442 47
that 1 442 47
any 1 442 47
highly 1 442 47
sensitive 1 442 47
story 1 442 47
has 1 442 47
to 1 442 47
go 1 442 47
through 1 442 47
before 1 442 47
publication. 1 442 47

In 1 442 48
that 1 442 48
lengthy 1 442 48
process, 1 442 48
a 1 442 48
variety 1 442 48
of 1 442 48
commissioning 1 442 48
editors, 1 442 48
lawyers, 1 442 48
backbench 1 442 48
editors 1 442 48
and 1 442 48
the 1 442 48
editor 1 442 48
herself, 1 442 48
Kath 1 442 48
Viner, 1 442 48
would 1 442 48
normally 1 442 48
insist 1 442 48
on 1 442 48
cuts 1 442 48
to 1 442 48
anything 1 442 48
that 1 442 48
could 1 442 48
not 1 442 48
be 1 442 48
rigorously 1 442 48
defended 1 442 48
and 1 442 48
corroborated. 1 442 48

And 1 442 49
yet 1 442 49
this 1 442 49
piece 1 442 49
seems 1 442 49
to 1 442 49
have 1 442 49
been 1 442 49
casually 1 442 49
waved 1 442 49
through, 1 442 49
given 1 442 49
a 1 442 49
green 1 442 49
light 1 442 49
even 1 442 49
though 1 442 49
its 1 442 49
profound 1 442 49
shortcomings 1 442 49
were 1 442 49
evident 1 442 49
to 1 442 49
a 1 442 49
range 1 442 49
of 1 442 49
well-placed 1 442 49
analysts 1 442 49
and 1 442 49
journalists 1 442 49
from 1 442 49
the 1 442 49
outset. 1 442 49

That 0 442 50
at 0 442 50
the 0 442 50
very 0 442 50
least 0 442 50
hints 0 442 50
that 0 442 50
the 0 442 50
Guardian 0 442 50
thought 0 442 50
they 0 442 50
had 0 442 50
“insurance” 0 442 50
on 0 442 50
this 0 442 50
story. 0 442 50

And 0 442 51
the 0 442 51
only 0 442 51
people 0 442 51
who 0 442 51
could 0 442 51
have 0 442 51
promised 0 442 51
that 0 442 51
kind 0 442 51
of 0 442 51
insurance 0 442 51
are 0 442 51
the 0 442 51
security 0 442 51
and 0 442 51
intelligence 0 442 51
services 0 442 51
– 0 442 51
presumably 0 442 51
of 0 442 51
Britain, 0 442 51
the 0 442 51
United 0 442 51
States 0 442 51
and 0 442 51
/ 0 442 51
or 0 442 51
Ecuador. 0 442 51

It 1 442 52
appears 1 442 52
the 1 442 52
Guardian 1 442 52
has 1 442 52
simply 1 442 52
taken 1 442 52
this 1 442 52
story, 1 442 52
provided 1 442 52
by 1 442 52
spooks, 1 442 52
at 1 442 52
face 1 442 52
value. 1 442 52

Even 1 442 53
if 1 442 53
it 1 442 53
later 1 442 53
turns 1 442 53
out 1 442 53
that 1 442 53
Manafort 1 442 53
did 1 442 53
visit 1 442 53
Assange, 1 442 53
the 1 442 53
Guardian 1 442 53
clearly 1 442 53
had 1 442 53
no 1 442 53
compelling 1 442 53
evidence 1 442 53
for 1 442 53
its 1 442 53
claims 1 442 53
when 1 442 53
it 1 442 53
published 1 442 53
them. 1 442 53

That 1 442 54
is 1 442 54
profoundly 1 442 54
irresponsible 1 442 54
journalism 1 442 54
– 1 442 54
fake 1 442 54
news 1 442 54
– 1 442 54
that 1 442 54
should 1 442 54
be 1 442 54
of 1 442 54
the 1 442 54
gravest 1 442 54
concern 1 442 54
to 1 442 54
readers. 1 442 54

A 0 442 55
pattern, 0 442 55
not 0 442 55
an 0 442 55
aberration 0 442 55

Despite 1 442 56
all 1 442 56
this, 1 442 56
even 1 442 56
analysts 1 442 56
critical 1 442 56
of 1 442 56
the 1 442 56
Guardian’s 1 442 56
behaviour 1 442 56
have 1 442 56
shown 1 442 56
a 1 442 56
glaring 1 442 56
failure 1 442 56
to 1 442 56
understand 1 442 56
that 1 442 56
its 1 442 56
latest 1 442 56
coverage 1 442 56
represents 1 442 56
not 1 442 56
an 1 442 56
aberration 1 442 56
by 1 442 56
the 1 442 56
paper 1 442 56
but 1 442 56
decisively 1 442 56
fits 1 442 56
with 1 442 56
a 1 442 56
pattern. 1 442 56

Glenn 0 442 57
Greenwald, 0 442 57
who 0 442 57
once 0 442 57
had 0 442 57
an 0 442 57
influential 0 442 57
column 0 442 57
in 0 442 57
the 0 442 57
Guardian 0 442 57
until 0 442 57
an 0 442 57
apparent, 0 442 57
though 0 442 57
unacknowledged, 0 442 57
falling 0 442 57
out 0 442 57
with 0 442 57
his 0 442 57
employer 0 442 57
over 0 442 57
the 0 442 57
Edward 0 442 57
Snowden 0 442 57
revelations, 0 442 57
wrote 0 442 57
a 0 442 57
series 0 442 57
of 0 442 57
baffling 1 442 57
observations 1 442 57
about 0 442 57
the 0 442 57
Guardian’s 0 442 57
latest 0 442 57
story. 0 442 57

First, 0 442 58
he 0 442 58
suggested 0 442 58
it 0 442 58
was 0 442 58
simply 0 442 58
evidence 0 442 58
of 0 442 58
the 0 442 58
Guardian’s 0 442 58
long-standing 1 442 58
(and 1 442 58
well-documented) 1 442 58
hostility 1 442 58
towards 1 442 58
Assange. 1 442 58

“The 1 442 59
Guardian, 1 442 59
an 1 442 59
otherwise 1 442 59
solid 1 442 59
and 1 442 59
reliable 1 442 59
paper, 1 442 59
has 1 442 59
such 1 442 59
a 1 442 59
pervasive 1 442 59
and 1 442 59
unprofessionally 1 442 59
personal 1 442 59
hatred 1 442 59
for 1 442 59
Julian 1 442 59
Assange 1 442 59
that 1 442 59
it 1 442 59
has 1 442 59
frequently 1 442 59
dispensed 1 442 59
with 1 442 59
all 1 442 59
journalistic 1 442 59
standards 1 442 59
in 1 442 59
order 1 442 59
to 1 442 59
malign 1 442 59
him.” 1 442 59

It 1 442 60
was 1 442 60
also 1 442 60
apparently 1 442 60
evidence 1 442 60
of 1 442 60
the 1 442 60
paper’s 1 442 60
clickbait 1 442 60
tendencies: 1 442 60

“They 1 442 61
[Guardian 1 442 61
editors] 1 442 61
knew 1 442 61
that 1 442 61
publishing 1 442 61
this 1 442 61
story 1 442 61
would 1 442 61
cause 1 442 61
partisan 1 442 61
warriors 1 442 61
to 1 442 61
excitedly 1 442 61
spread 1 442 61
the 1 442 61
story, 1 442 61
and 1 442 61
that 1 442 61
cable 1 442 61
news 1 442 61
outlets 1 442 61
would 1 442 61
hyperventilate 1 442 61
over 1 442 61
it, 1 442 61
and 1 442 61
that 1 442 61
they’d 1 442 61
reap 1 442 61
the 1 442 61
rewards 1 442 61
regardless 1 442 61
of 1 442 61
whether 1 442 61
the 1 442 61
story 1 442 61
turned 1 442 61
out 1 442 61
to 1 442 61
be 1 442 61
true 1 442 61
or 1 442 61
false.” 1 442 61

And 0 442 62
finally, 0 442 62
in 0 442 62
a 1 442 62
bizarre 1 442 62
tweet, 1 442 62
Greenwald 0 442 62
opined, 0 442 62
“I 0 442 62
hope 0 442 62
the 0 442 62
story 0 442 62
[maligning 0 442 62
Assange] 0 442 62
turns 0 442 62
out 0 442 62
true” 0 442 62
– 0 442 62
apparently 1 442 62
because 1 442 62
maintenance 1 442 62
of 1 442 62
the 1 442 62
Guardian’s 1 442 62
reputation 1 442 62
is 1 442 62
more 1 442 62
important 1 442 62
than 1 442 62
Assange’s 1 442 62
fate 1 442 62
and 1 442 62
the 1 442 62
right 1 442 62
of 1 442 62
journalists 1 442 62
to 1 442 62
dig 1 442 62
up 1 442 62
embarrassing 1 442 62
secrets 1 442 62
without 1 442 62
fear 1 442 62
of 1 442 62
being 1 442 62
imprisoned. 1 442 62

I 0 442 63
think 0 442 63
the 0 442 63
Guardian 0 442 63
is 0 442 63
an 0 442 63
important 0 442 63
paper 0 442 63
with 0 442 63
great 0 442 63
journalists. 0 442 63

I 0 442 64
hope 0 442 64
the 0 442 64
story 0 442 64
turns 0 442 64
out 0 442 64
true. 0 442 64

But 0 442 65
the 0 442 65
skepticism 0 442 65
over 0 442 65
this 0 442 65
story 0 442 65
is 0 442 65
very 0 442 65
widespread, 0 442 65
including 0 442 65
among 0 442 65
Assange's 1 442 65
most 1 442 65
devoted 1 442 65
haters, 1 442 65
because 0 442 65
it's 0 442 65
so 0 442 65
sketchy. 0 442 65

If 0 442 66
Manafort 0 442 66
went 0 442 66
there, 0 442 66
there's 0 442 66
video. 0 442 66

Let's 0 442 67
see 0 442 67
it. 0 442 67

Deeper 0 442 69
malaise 0 442 69

What 0 442 70
this 0 442 70
misses 0 442 70
is 0 442 70
that 0 442 70
the 0 442 70
Guardian’s 0 442 70
attacks 0 442 70
on 0 442 70
Assange 0 442 70
are 0 442 70
not 0 442 70
exceptional 0 442 70
or 0 442 70
motivated 0 442 70
solely 0 442 70
by 0 442 70
personal 0 442 70
animosity. 0 442 70

They 0 442 71
are 0 442 71
entirely 0 442 71
predictable 0 442 71
and 0 442 71
systematic. 0 442 71

Rather 1 442 72
than 1 442 72
being 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
reason 1 442 72
for 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
Guardian 1 442 72
violating 1 442 72
basic 1 442 72
journalistic 1 442 72
standards 1 442 72
and 1 442 72
ethics, 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
paper’s 1 442 72
hatred 1 442 72
of 1 442 72
Assange 1 442 72
is 1 442 72
a 1 442 72
symptom 1 442 72
of 1 442 72
a 1 442 72
deeper 1 442 72
malaise 1 442 72
in 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
Guardian 1 442 72
and 1 442 72
the 1 442 72
wider 1 442 72
corporate 1 442 72
media. 1 442 72

Even 1 442 73
aside 1 442 73
from 1 442 73
its 1 442 73
decade-long 1 442 73
campaign 1 442 73
against 1 442 73
Assange, 1 442 73
the 1 442 73
Guardian 1 442 73
is 1 442 73
far 1 442 73
from 1 442 73
“solid 1 442 73
and 1 442 73
reliable”, 1 442 73
as 1 442 73
Greenwald 1 442 73
claims. 1 442 73

It 1 442 74
has 1 442 74
been 1 442 74
at 1 442 74
the 1 442 74
forefront 1 442 74
of 1 442 74
the 1 442 74
relentless, 1 442 74
and 1 442 74
unhinged, 1 442 74
attacks 1 442 74
on 1 442 74
Labour 1 442 74
leader 1 442 74
Jeremy 1 442 74
Corbyn 1 442 74
for 1 442 74
prioritising 1 442 74
the 1 442 74
rights 1 442 74
of 1 442 74
Palestinians 1 442 74
over 1 442 74
Israel’s 1 442 74
right 1 442 74
to 1 442 74
continue 1 442 74
its 1 442 74
belligerent 1 442 74
occupation. 1 442 74

Over 1 442 75
the 1 442 75
past 1 442 75
three 1 442 75
years, 1 442 75
the 1 442 75
Guardian 1 442 75
has 1 442 75
injected 1 442 75
credibility 1 442 75
into 1 442 75
the 1 442 75
Israel 1 442 75
lobby’s 1 442 75
desperate 1 442 75
efforts 1 442 75
to 1 442 75
tar 1 442 75
Corbyn 1 442 75
as 1 442 75
an 1 442 75
anti-semite. 1 442 75

See 0 442 76
here, 0 442 76
here 0 442 76
and 0 442 76
here. 0 442 76

Similarly, 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
Guardian 1 442 77
worked 1 442 77
tirelessly 1 442 77
to 1 442 77
promote 1 442 77
Clinton 1 442 77
and 1 442 77
undermine 1 442 77
Sanders 1 442 77
in 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
2016 1 442 77
Democratic 1 442 77
nomination 1 442 77
process 1 442 77
– 1 442 77
another 1 442 77
reason 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
paper 1 442 77
has 1 442 77
been 1 442 77
so 1 442 77
assiduous 1 442 77
in 1 442 77
promoting 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
idea 1 442 77
that 1 442 77
Assange, 1 442 77
aided 1 442 77
by 1 442 77
Russia, 1 442 77
was 1 442 77
determined 1 442 77
to 1 442 77
promote 1 442 77
Trump 1 442 77
over 1 442 77
Clinton 1 442 77
for 1 442 77
the 1 442 77
presidency. 1 442 77

The 1 442 78
Guardian’s 1 442 78
coverage 1 442 78
of 1 442 78
Latin 1 442 78
America, 1 442 78
especially 1 442 78
of 1 442 78
populist 1 442 78
leftwing 1 442 78
governments 1 442 78
that 1 442 78
have 1 442 78
rebelled 1 442 78
against 1 442 78
traditional 1 442 78
and 1 442 78
oppressive 1 442 78
US 1 442 78
hegemony 1 442 78

the 1 442 78
region, 1 442 78
has 1 442 78
long 1 442 78
grated 1 442 78
with 1 442 78
analysts 1 442 78
and 1 442 78
experts. 1 442 78

Its 1 442 79
especial 1 442 79
venom 1 442 79
has 1 442 79
been 1 442 79
reserved 1 442 79
for 1 442 79
leftwing 1 442 79
figures 1 442 79
like 1 442 79
Venezuela’s 1 442 79

official 1 442 79
enemies 1 442 79
of 1 442 79

rather 1 442 79
than 1 442 79

region’s 1 442 79
rightwing 1 442 79
authoritarians 1 442 79
beloved 1 442 79
of 1 442 79

The 1 442 80
Guardian 1 442 80
has 1 442 80
been 1 442 80
vocal 1 442 80
in 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
so-called 1 442 80
“fake 1 442 80
news” 1 442 80
hysteria, 1 442 80
decrying 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
influence 1 442 80
of 1 442 80
social 1 442 80
media, 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
only 1 442 80
place 1 442 80
where 1 442 80
leftwing 1 442 80
dissidents 1 442 80
have 1 442 80
managed 1 442 80
to 1 442 80
find 1 442 80
a 1 442 80
small 1 442 80
foothold 1 442 80
to 1 442 80
promote 1 442 80
their 1 442 80
politics 1 442 80
and 1 442 80
counter 1 442 80
the 1 442 80
corporate 1 442 80
media 1 442 80
narrative. 1 442 80

The 1 442 81
Guardian 1 442 81
has 1 442 81
painted 1 442 81
social 1 442 81
media 1 442 81
chiefly 1 442 81
as 1 442 81
a 1 442 81
platform 1 442 81
overrun 1 442 81
by 1 442 81
Russian 1 442 81
trolls, 1 442 81
arguing 1 442 81
that 1 442 81
this 1 442 81
should 1 442 81
justify 1 442 81
ever-tighter 1 442 81
restrictions 1 442 81
that 1 442 81
have 1 442 81
so 1 442 81
far 1 442 81
curbed 1 442 81
critical 1 442 81
voices 1 442 81
of 1 442 81
the 1 442 81
dissident 1 442 81
left 1 442 81
more 1 442 81
than 1 442 81
the 1 442 81
right. 1 442 81

Heroes 0 442 82
of 0 442 82
the 0 442 82
neoliberal 0 442 82
order 0 442 82

Equally, 1 442 83
the 1 442 83
Guardian 1 442 83
has 1 442 83
made 1 442 83
clear 1 442 83
who 1 442 83
its 1 442 83
true 1 442 83
heroes 1 442 83
are. 1 442 83

Certainly 1 442 84
not 1 442 84
Corbyn 1 442 84
or 1 442 84
Assange, 1 442 84
who 1 442 84
threaten 1 442 84
to 1 442 84
disrupt 1 442 84
the 1 442 84
entrenched 1 442 84
neoliberal 1 442 84
order 1 442 84
that 1 442 84
is 1 442 84
hurtling 1 442 84
us 1 442 84
towards 1 442 84
climate 1 442 84
breakdown 1 442 84
and 1 442 84
economic 1 442 84
collapse. 1 442 84

Its 1 442 85
pages, 1 442 85
however, 1 442 85
are 1 442 85
readily 1 442 85
available 1 442 85
to 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
latest 1 442 85
effort 1 442 85
to 1 442 85
prop 1 442 85
up 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
status 1 442 85
quo 1 442 85
from 1 442 85
Tony 1 442 85
Blair, 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
man 1 442 85
who 1 442 85
led 1 442 85
Britain, 1 442 85
on 1 442 85
false 1 442 85
pretences, 1 442 85
into 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
largest 1 442 85
crime 1 442 85
against 1 442 85
humanity 1 442 85
in 1 442 85
living 1 442 85
memory 1 442 85
– 1 442 85
the 1 442 85
attack 1 442 85
on 1 442 85
Iraq. 1 442 85

That 1 442 86
“humanitarian 1 442 86
intervention” 1 442 86
cost 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
lives 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
many 1 442 86
hundreds 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
thousands 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
Iraqis 1 442 86
and 1 442 86
created 1 442 86
a 1 442 86
vacuum 1 442 86
that 1 442 86
destabilised 1 442 86
much 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
Middle 1 442 86
East, 1 442 86
sucked 1 442 86
in 1 442 86
Islamic 1 442 86
jihadists 1 442 86
like 1 442 86
al-Qaeda 1 442 86
and 1 442 86
ISIS, 1 442 86
and 1 442 86
contributed 1 442 86
to 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
migrant 1 442 86
crisis 1 442 86
in 1 442 86
Europe 1 442 86
that 1 442 86
has 1 442 86
fuelled 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
resurgence 1 442 86
of 1 442 86
the 1 442 86
far-right. 1 442 86

None 1 442 87
of 1 442 87
that 1 442 87
is 1 442 87
discussed 1 442 87
in 1 442 87
the 1 442 87
Guardian 1 442 87
or 1 442 87
considered 1 442 87
grounds 1 442 87
for 1 442 87
disqualifying 1 442 87
Blair 1 442 87
as 1 442 87
an 1 442 87
arbiter 1 442 87
of 1 442 87
what 1 442 87
is 1 442 87
good 1 442 87
for 1 442 87
Britain 1 442 87
and 1 442 87
the 1 442 87
world’s 1 442 87
future. 1 442 87

The 1 442 88
Guardian 1 442 88
also 1 442 88
has 1 442 88
an 1 442 88
especial 1 442 88
soft 1 442 88
spot 1 442 88
for 1 442 88
blogger 1 442 88
Elliot 1 442 88
Higgins, 1 442 88
who, 1 442 88
aided 1 442 88
by 1 442 88
the 1 442 88
Guardian, 1 442 88
has 1 442 88
shot 1 442 88
to 1 442 88
unlikely 1 442 88
prominence 1 442 88
as 1 442 88
a 1 442 88
self-styled 1 442 88
“weapons 1 442 88
expert”. 1 442 88

Like 1 442 89
Luke 1 442 89
Harding, 1 442 89
Higgins 1 442 89
invariably 1 442 89
seems 1 442 89
ready 1 442 89
to 1 442 89
echo 1 442 89
whatever 1 442 89
the 1 442 89
British 1 442 89
and 1 442 89
American 1 442 89
security 1 442 89
services 1 442 89
need 1 442 89
verifying 1 442 89
“independently”. 1 442 89

Higgins 1 442 90
and 1 442 90
his 1 442 90
well-staffed 1 442 90
website 1 442 90
Bellingcat 1 442 90
have 1 442 90
taken 1 442 90
on 1 442 90
for 1 442 90
themselves 1 442 90
the 1 442 90
role 1 442 90
of 1 442 90
arbiters 1 442 90
of 1 442 90
truth 1 442 90
on 1 442 90
many 1 442 90
foreign 1 442 90
affairs 1 442 90
issues, 1 442 90
taking 1 442 90
a 1 442 90
prominent 1 442 90
role 1 442 90
in 1 442 90
advocating 1 442 90
for 1 442 90
narratives 1 442 90
that 1 442 90
promote 1 442 90
US 1 442 90
and 1 442 90
NATO 1 442 90
hegemony 1 442 90
while 1 442 90
demonising 1 442 90
Russia, 1 442 90
especially 1 442 90
in 1 442 90
highly 1 442 90
contested 1 442 90
arenas 1 442 90
such 1 442 90
as 1 442 90
Syria. 1 442 90

That 0 442 91
clear 0 442 91
partisanship 0 442 91
should 0 442 91
be 0 442 91
no 0 442 91
surprise, 0 442 91
given 0 442 91
that 0 442 91
Higgins 0 442 91
now 0 442 91
enjoys 0 442 91
an 0 442 91
“academic” 0 442 91
position 0 442 91
at, 0 442 91
and 0 442 91
funding 0 442 91
from, 0 442 91
the 0 442 91
Atlantic 0 442 91
Council, 0 442 91
a 1 442 91
high-level, 1 442 91
Washington-based 1 442 91
think-tank 1 442 91
founded 1 442 91
to 1 442 91
drum 1 442 91
up 1 442 91
support 1 442 91
for 1 442 91
NATO 1 442 91
and 1 442 91
justify 1 442 91
its 1 442 91
imperialist 1 442 91
agenda. 1 442 91

Improbably, 1 442 92
the 1 442 92
Guardian 1 442 92
has 1 442 92
adopted 1 442 92
Higgins 1 442 92
as 1 442 92
the 1 442 92
poster-boy 1 442 92
for 1 442 92
a 1 442 92
supposed 1 442 92
citizen 1 442 92
journalism 1 442 92
it 1 442 92
has 1 442 92
sought 1 442 92
to 1 442 92
undermine 1 442 92
as 1 442 92
“fake 1 442 92
news” 1 442 92
whenever 1 442 92
it 1 442 92
occurs 1 442 92
on 1 442 92
social 1 442 92
media 1 442 92
without 1 442 92
the 1 442 92
endorsement 1 442 92
of 1 442 92
state-backed 1 442 92
organisations. 1 442 92

The 1 442 93
truth 1 442 93
is 1 442 93
that 1 442 93
the 1 442 93
Guardian 1 442 93
has 1 442 93
not 1 442 93
erred 1 442 93
in 1 442 93
this 1 442 93
latest 1 442 93
story 1 442 93
attacking 1 442 93
Assange, 1 442 93
or 1 442 93
in 1 442 93
its 1 442 93
much 1 442 93
longer-running 1 442 93
campaign 1 442 93
to 1 442 93
vilify 1 442 93
him. 1 442 93

With 1 442 94
this 1 442 94
story, 1 442 94
it 1 442 94
has 1 442 94
done 1 442 94
what 1 442 94
it 1 442 94
regularly 1 442 94
does 1 442 94
when 1 442 94
supposedly 1 442 94
vital 1 442 94
western 1 442 94
foreign 1 442 94
policy 1 442 94
interests 1 442 94
are 1 442 94
at 1 442 94
stake 1 442 94
– 1 442 94
it 1 442 94
simply 1 442 94
regurgitates 1 442 94
an 1 442 94
elite-serving, 1 442 94
western 1 442 94
narrative. 1 442 94

Its 1 442 95
job 1 442 95
is 1 442 95
to 1 442 95
shore 1 442 95
up 1 442 95
a 1 442 95
consensus 1 442 95

to 1 442 95
the 1 442 95
existing, 1 442 95
neoliberal 1 442 95
order: 1 442 95
whether 0 442 95
they 0 442 95
are 0 442 95
a 0 442 95
platform 0 442 95
like 0 442 95
Wikileaks 0 442 95
promoting 0 442 95
whistle-blowing 1 442 95
against 0 442 95
a 1 442 95
corrupt 1 442 95
western 1 442 95
elite; 1 442 95
or 0 442 95
a 0 442 95

including 0 442 95
the 0 442 95

The 1 442 96

Patel, 0 444 6
32, 0 444 6
was 0 444 6
the 0 444 6
first 0 444 6
Indian-American 0 444 6

Patel 0 444 7
has 0 444 7
previously 0 444 7
performed 0 444 7
on 0 444 7
Late 0 444 7

During 0 444 8
the 0 444 8
event, 0 444 8
Patel’s 0 444 8
performance 0 444 8
featured 0 444 8
commentary 0 444 8
on 0 444 8
his 0 444 8
experience 0 444 8
living 0 444 8
in 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
diverse 0 444 8
area 0 444 8
of 0 444 8
New 0 444 8
York 0 444 8
City—including 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
joke 0 444 8
about 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
gay, 0 444 8
black 0 444 8
man 0 444 8
in 0 444 8
his 0 444 8
neighborhood—which 0 444 8
AAA 0 444 8
officials 0 444 8
deemed 0 444 8
inappropriate. 0 444 8

Patel 0 444 9
joked 0 444 9
that 0 444 9
being 0 444 9
gay 0 444 9
cannot 0 444 9
be 0 444 9
a 0 444 9
choice 0 444 9
because 0 444 9
“no 1 444 9
one 1 444 9
looks 1 444 9
in 1 444 9
the 1 444 9
mirror 1 444 9
and 1 444 9
thinks, 1 444 9
‘this 1 444 9
black 1 444 9
thing 1 444 9
is 1 444 9
too 1 444 9
easy, 1 444 9
let 1 444 9
me 1 444 9
just 1 444 9
add 1 444 9
another 1 444 9
thing 1 444 9
to 1 444 9
it.’” 0 444 9

That's 0 444 10
what 0 444 10
Columbia 1 444 10
snowflakes 1 444 10
thought 0 444 10
was 0 444 10
offensive. 0 444 10

I 0 444 11
can't 0 444 11
imagine 0 444 11
what 0 444 11
they 0 444 11
would 0 444 11
have 0 444 11
made 0 444 11
of 0 444 11
Richard 0 444 11
Pryor, 0 444 11
or 0 444 11
at 0 444 11
this 0 444 11
point 0 444 11
even, 0 444 11
Chris 0 444 11
Rock. 0 444 11

It's 0 444 12
also 0 444 12
a 0 444 12
version 0 444 12
of 0 444 12
a 0 444 12
Sammy 0 444 12
Davis 0 444 12
Jr 0 444 12
joke 0 444 12
about 0 444 12
converting 0 444 12
to 0 444 12
Judaism. 0 444 12

Which 0 444 13
is 0 444 13
now 0 444 13
a 0 444 13
hate 0 444 13
crime. 0 444 13

About 0 444 14

Patel’s 0 444 14

members 0 444 14
of 0 444 14
AAA 0 444 14
interrupted 0 444 14
the 0 444 14
performance, 0 444 14
denounced 0 444 14
his 0 444 14
jokes 0 444 14
about 0 444 14
racial 0 444 14
identities 0 444 14
and 0 444 14
sexual 0 444 14
orientation, 0 444 14
and 0 444 14
provided 0 444 14
him 0 444 14
with 0 444 14
a 0 444 14
few 0 444 14
moments 0 444 14
for 0 444 14
closing 0 444 14
remarks. 0 444 14

Comrades, 1 444 15
these 1 444 15
jokes 1 444 15
you 1 444 15
have 1 444 15
been 1 444 15
listening 1 444 15
to 1 444 15
are 1 444 15
thought 1 444 15
crimes! 1 444 15

Patel 0 444 16
pushed 0 444 16
back 0 444 16
on 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
officials’ 0 444 16
remarks, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
said 0 444 16
that 0 444 16
while 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
stood 0 444 16
in 0 444 16
solidarity 0 444 16
with 0 444 16
Asian 0 444 16
American 0 444 16
identities, 0 444 16
none 0 444 16
of 0 444 16
his 0 444 16
remarks 0 444 16
were 0 444 16
offensive, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
was 0 444 16
exposing 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
audience 0 444 16
to 0 444 16
ideas 0 444 16
that 0 444 16
would 0 444 16
be 0 444 16
found 0 444 16
“in 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
real 0 444 16
world.” 0 444 16
Before 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
could 0 444 16
finish, 0 444 16
Patel’s 0 444 16
microphone 0 444 16
was 0 444 16
cut 0 444 16
from 0 444 16
off-stage, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
proceeded 0 444 16
to 0 444 16
leave. 0 444 16

The 0 444 17
real 0 444 17
world? 0 444 17

This 0 444 18
is 0 444 18

Sofia 0 444 19
Jao, 0 444 19
BC 0 444 19
‘22, 0 444 19

not 0 444 19
in 0 444 19
the 0 444 19

but 0 444 19
with 0 444 19
Patel’s 0 444 19
closing 0 444 19
remarks. 0 444 19

“I 0 444 20
really 0 444 20
dislike 0 444 20
when 0 444 20
people 0 444 20
who 0 444 20
are 0 444 20
older 0 444 20
say 0 444 20
that 0 444 20
our 0 444 20

exposed 0 444 20
to 0 444 20
the 0 444 20
real 0 444 20
world. 0 444 20

Obviously 0 444 21
the 0 444 21
world 0 444 21
is 0 444 21
not 0 444 21
a 0 444 21
safe 0 444 21
space 0 444 21
but 0 444 21
just 0 444 21
accepting 0 444 21
that 0 444 21
it’s 0 444 21
not 0 444 21
and 0 444 21
continuing 0 444 21
to 0 444 21

the 0 444 21
un-safeness 0 444 21
of 0 444 21
it… 0 444 21
is 0 444 21
saying 0 444 21
that 0 444 21
it 0 444 21
can’t 0 444 21
be 0 444 21
changed,” 0 444 21

Jao. 0 444 21

“When 0 444 22
older 0 444 22

being 0 444 22
so 0 444 22
sensitive, 0 444 22
it’s 0 444 22

Francis 0 163 21
encountered 0 163 21
protests 0 163 21
in 0 163 21
Chile 0 163 21
over 0 163 21
his 0 163 21

during 0 163 21
his 0 163 21

last 0 163 21

calling 0 163 21
the 0 163 21
accusations 0 163 21
against 0 163 21
the 0 163 21
priest 0 163 21
“calumny.” 1 163 21

While 0 163 22
Francis 0 163 22
later 0 163 22
apologized, 0 163 22
he 0 163 22
persisted 0 163 22
in 0 163 22
defending 0 163 22
Barros, 0 163 22
denying 0 163 22
that 0 163 22
he 0 163 22
had 0 163 22
received 0 163 22
any 0 163 22
testimony 0 163 22
himself 0 163 22
and 0 163 22
restating 0 163 22
that 0 163 22
such 0 163 22
unproven 0 163 22
accusations 0 163 22
are 0 163 22
“slander.” 1 163 22

The 0 163 23
Pope 0 163 23
later 0 163 23
said 0 163 23
he 0 163 23
would 0 163 23

the 0 163 23

Expectations 0 163 24
were 0 163 24
high 0 163 24
in 0 163 24
2014 0 163 24
when 0 163 24
the 0 163 24
Pope 0 163 24
created 0 163 24
the 0 163 24
abuse 0 163 24
commission. 0 163 24

And 0 163 25
while 0 163 25
he 0 163 25

continually 0 163 25
condemned 0 163 25
clergy 0 163 25

throughout 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
pontificate, 0 163 25
some 0 163 25
have 0 163 25
argued 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
actions 0 163 25
in 0 163 25
some 0 163 25
serious 0 163 25
cases 0 163 25
don’t 0 163 25
match 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
tough 0 163 25
stances 0 163 25
on 0 163 25
abuse. 0 163 25

Four 0 163 26
members 0 163 26
of 0 163 26

had 0 163 26
met 0 163 26
with 0 163 26
Cardinal 0 163 26
O’Malley 0 163 26
in 0 163 26
2015, 0 163 26
conveying 0 163 26
their 0 163 26
objections 0 163 26
to 0 163 26
Francis’s 0 163 26
2015 0 163 26

of 0 163 26
Barros 0 163 26
as 0 163 26
bishop 0 163 26
of 0 163 26
Osorno. 0 163 26

It 0 163 27
was 0 163 27
at 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
meeting 0 163 27
with 0 163 27
O’Malley 0 163 27
that 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
abuse 0 163 27
commission 0 163 27
representatives 0 163 27
reportedly 0 163 27
gave 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
letter 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
cardinal 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
deliver 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
Francis, 0 163 27
and 0 163 27
O’Malley 0 163 27
later 0 163 27
confirmed 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
a 0 163 27
commission 0 163 27
member 0 163 27
that 0 163 27
he 0 163 27
had 0 163 27
in 0 163 27
fact 0 163 27
personally 0 163 27
delivered 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
letter 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
Pope. 0 163 27

Yore 0 163 28
explained 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
Pope 0 163 28
has 0 163 28
been 0 163 28
told 0 163 28
from 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
moment 0 163 28
he 0 163 28
appointed 0 163 28
Barros 0 163 28
in 0 163 28
2015 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
it 0 163 28
was 0 163 28
a 0 163 28
bad 0 163 28
decision, 0 163 28
between 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
Chilean 0 163 28
bishops’ 0 163 28
conference, 0 163 28
petitions, 0 163 28
letters 0 163 28
and 0 163 28
calls, 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
were 0 163 28
all 0 163 28
ignored. 0 163 28

Further, 0 163 29
a 0 163 29
Chilean 0 163 29
judicial 0 163 29
inquiry 0 163 29
found 0 163 29
all 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
victims 0 163 29
who 0 163 29
testified 0 163 29
— 0 163 29
including 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
letter’s 0 163 29
author 0 163 29
Juan 0 163 29
Carlos 0 163 29
— 0 163 29
to 0 163 29
be 0 163 29
credible, 0 163 29
and 0 163 29
that 0 163 29
there 0 163 29
was 0 163 29
a 0 163 29
major 0 163 29
cover-up 0 163 29
of 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
abuse 0 163 29
by 0 163 29
Father 0 163 29
Karadima. 0 163 29

Arroyo 0 163 30
spoke 0 163 30
with 0 163 30
Cruz 0 163 30
as 0 163 30
well, 0 163 30
who 0 163 30
said 0 163 30
he 0 163 30
was 0 163 30
“incredibly 1 163 30
frustrated” 1 163 30
when 0 163 30
Barros 0 163 30
was 0 163 30
going 0 163 30
to 0 163 30
be 0 163 30
appointed. 0 163 30

He’d 0 163 31
testified 0 163 31
about 0 163 31
three 0 163 31
bishops 0 163 31
who 0 163 31
had 0 163 31
witnessed 0 163 31
abuse, 0 163 31
he 0 163 31
said, 0 163 31
but 0 163 31
Barros 0 163 31
had 0 163 31
special 0 163 31
significance 0 163 31
for 0 163 31
him 0 163 31
because 0 163 31
Barros’ 0 163 31
part 0 163 31
went 0 163 31
beyond 0 163 31
witnessing 0 163 31
the 0 163 31
abuse, 0 163 31
to 0 163 31
violating 1 163 31
his 1 163 31
seal 1 163 31
of 1 163 31
Confession 1 163 31
with 1 163 31
Karadima 1 163 31
and 0 163 31
psychological 0 163 31
abuse 0 163 31
through 0 163 31
intimidation. 0 163 31

Cruz 0 163 32
recounted 0 163 32
how 0 163 32
he 0 163 32
and 0 163 32
other 0 163 32
victims 0 163 32
had 0 163 32
been 0 163 32
dismissed 0 163 32
or 0 163 32
slandered 0 163 32
by 0 163 32
local 0 163 32
Church 0 163 32
hierarchy 0 163 32
for 0 163 32
numerous 0 163 32
attempts 0 163 32
to 0 163 32
be 0 163 32
heard. 0 163 32

And 0 163 33
he 0 163 33
spoke 0 163 33
about 0 163 33
holding 0 163 33
out 0 163 33
hope 0 163 33
that 0 163 33
there 0 163 33
would 0 163 33
be 0 163 33
a 0 163 33
different 0 163 33
response 0 163 33
from 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
Pope, 0 163 33
discussing 0 163 33
specifics 0 163 33
of 0 163 33
getting 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
letter 0 163 33
to 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
Francis 0 163 33
via 0 163 33
Cardinal 0 163 33
O’Malley. 0 163 33

Cruz 0 163 34
told 0 163 34
Arroyo 0 163 34
he 0 163 34
was 0 163 34
really 0 163 34
hurt 0 163 34
and 0 163 34
felt 0 163 34
betrayed 0 163 34
by 0 163 34
the 0 163 34
Pope’s 0 163 34
comments 0 163 34
that 0 163 34
the 0 163 34
accusations 0 163 34
were 0 163 34
slander, 0 163 34
and 0 163 34
there 0 163 34
were 0 163 34
no 0 163 34
witnesses 0 163 34
or 0 163 34
evidence. 0 163 34

“To 0 163 35
hear 0 163 35
him 0 163 35
talk 0 163 35
about 0 163 35
us 0 163 35
that 0 163 35
way,” 0 163 35
Cruz 0 163 35
said, 0 163 35
“calling 0 163 35
us 0 163 35
slanderers, 0 163 35
it 0 163 35
was 0 163 35
terrible 0 163 35
because 0 163 35
it 0 163 35
set 0 163 35
the 0 163 35
clock 0 163 35
back 0 163 35
for 0 163 35
so 0 163 35
many 0 163 35
victims.” 0 163 35

Scicluna 0 163 36
will 0 163 36
be 0 163 36
meeting 0 163 36
with 0 163 36
Cruz, 0 163 36
who 0 163 36
said 0 163 36
he 0 163 36
hopes 0 163 36
other 0 163 36
abuse 0 163 36
survivors 0 163 36
will 0 163 36
be 0 163 36
heard 0 163 36
as 0 163 36
a 0 163 36
result 0 163 36
of 0 163 36
his 0 163 36
case 0 163 36
coming 0 163 36
more 0 163 36
to 0 163 36
the 0 163 36
forefront. 0 163 36

“This 0 163 37

Latin 1 163 39

She 0 163 43
said 0 163 43
she 0 163 43
would 0 163 43
argue 0 163 43
as 0 163 43
a 0 163 43

advocate 0 163 43
that 0 163 43

in 0 163 43
sexual 0 163 43
exploitation 0 163 43
of 0 163 43
children. 0 163 43

“So 0 163 44
I 0 163 44
don’t 0 163 44
think 0 163 44
this 0 163 44
is 0 163 44
simply 0 163 44
just 0 163 44
a 0 163 44

as 0 163 44
bad 0 163 44
as 0 163 44
it 0 163 44
is, 0 163 44
of 0 163 44
a 0 163 44

it 0 163 46

so 0 163 46
heinous.” 1 163 46

Yore 0 163 47

more 0 163 48

out 0 163 48

Arroyo, 0 163 48
maybe 0 163 48
even 0 163 48
some 0 163 48
even 0 163 48
worse 0 163 48

Israeli 0 165 16
reprisals 0 165 16
against 0 165 16
Syria 0 165 16
and 0 165 16
embarrass 0 165 16
Iran's 0 165 16
ally 0 165 16
Russia, 0 165 16
it 0 165 16
brought 0 165 16
attacks 0 165 16

and 0 165 16
possibly 0 165 16
Russian-manned 0 165 16

Moreover, 0 165 17
in 0 165 17
recent 0 165 17
months 0 165 17
Iranian 0 165 17
policy--suspending 0 165 17

to 0 165 17
ease 0 165 17
tensions 0 165 17
and 0 165 17
provide 0 165 17
no 0 165 17
new 0 165 17
causes 0 165 17
for 0 165 17
Trump 0 165 17

Prime 0 165 17

Rouhani 0 165 17

as 0 165 17
his 0 165 17

Indeed, 0 165 18
why 0 165 18
would 0 165 18
Iran, 0 165 18
which, 0 165 18
with 0 165 18
Assad, 0 165 18
Russia 0 165 18
and 0 165 18
Hezbollah, 0 165 18
is 0 165 18
among 0 165 18
the 0 165 18
victors 0 165 18
in 0 165 18
Syria's 0 165 18
six-year 0 165 18

wish 0 165 18
to 0 165 18

the 0 165 18

U.S. 0 165 18
firepower 0 165 18
in 0 165 18
on 0 165 18
the 0 165 18
other 0 165 18

In 0 165 19
Syria's 0 165 19
southeast, 0 165 19
another 0 165 19
incident 0 165 19
a 0 165 19
week 0 165 19
ago 0 165 19
may 0 165 19
portend 0 165 19
an 0 165 19
indefinite 0 165 19
U.S. 0 165 19
stay 0 165 19
in 0 165 19
that 0 165 19
broken 0 165 19
and 0 165 19
bleeding 0 165 19
country. 0 165 19

To 0 165 20
recapture 0 165 20
oil 0 165 20
fields 0 165 20
lost 0 165 20
in 0 165 20
the 0 165 20
war, 0 165 20
forces 0 165 20
backed 0 165 20
by 0 165 20
Assad 0 165 20
crossed 0 165 20
the 0 165 20
Euphrates 0 165 20
into 0 165 20
territory 0 165 20
taken 0 165 20
from 0 165 20
ISIS 0 165 20
by 0 165 20
the 0 165 20
U.S. 0 165 20
and 0 165 20
our 0 165 20
Kurd 0 165 20
allies. 0 165 20

The 0 165 21
U.S. 0 165 21
response 0 165 21
was 0 165 21
a 0 165 21
barrage 0 165 21
of 0 165 21
air 0 165 21
and 0 165 21
artillery 0 165 21
strikes 0 165 21
that 0 165 21
killed 0 165 21
100 0 165 21
soldiers. 0 165 21

What 0 165 22
this 0 165 22
signals 0 165 22
is 0 165 22
that, 0 165 22
though 0 165 22
ISIS 0 165 22
has 0 165 22
been 0 165 22
all 0 165 22
but 0 165 22
evicted 0 165 22
from 0 165 22
Syria, 0 165 22
the 0 165 22
U.S. 0 165 22
intends 0 165 22
to 0 165 22
retain 0 165 22
that 0 165 22
fourth 0 165 22
of 0 165 22
Syria 0 165 22
as 0 165 22
a 0 165 22
bargaining 1 165 22
chip 1 165 22
in 0 165 22
negotiations. 0 165 22

In 0 165 23
the 0 165 23
northwest, 0 165 23
Turkey 0 165 23
has 0 165 23
sent 0 165 23
its 0 165 23
Syrian 0 165 23
allies 0 165 23
to 0 165 23
attack 0 165 23
Afrin 0 165 23
and 0 165 23
President 0 165 23
Recep 0 165 23
Tayyip 0 165 23
Erdogan 0 165 23
has 0 165 23
threatened 0 165 23
Manbij, 0 165 23
80 0 165 23
miles 0 165 23
to 0 165 23
the 0 165 23
east, 0 165 23
where 0 165 23
U.S. 0 165 23
troops 0 165 23
commingle 0 165 23
with 0 165 23
the 0 165 23
Kurd 0 165 23
defenders 0 165 23
and 0 165 23
U.S. 0 165 23
generals 0 165 23
were 0 165 23
visible 0 165 23
last 0 165 23
week. 0 165 23

Midweek, 0 165 24
Erdogan 1 165 24
exploded: 1 165 24
"(The 0 165 24
Americans) 0 165 24
tell 0 165 24
us, 0 165 24
'Don't 0 165 24
come 0 165 24
to 0 165 24
Manbij.' 0 165 24

We 0 165 25
will 0 165 25
come 0 165 25
to 0 165 25
Manbij 0 165 25
to 0 165 25
hand 0 165 25
over 0 165 25
these 0 165 25
territories 0 165 25
to 0 165 25
their 0 165 25
rightful 0 165 25
owners." 0 165 25

The 0 165 26
U.S. 0 165 26
and 0 165 26
Turkey, 0 165 26
allies 0 165 26
for 0 165 26
six 0 165 26
decades, 0 165 26
with 0 165 26
the 0 165 26
largest 0 165 26
armies 0 165 26
in 0 165 26
NATO, 0 165 26
may 0 165 26
soon 0 165 26
be 0 165 26
staring 0 165 26
down 0 165 26
each 0 165 26
other's 0 165 26
gun 0 165 26
barrels. 0 165 26

Has 1 165 27
President 1 165 27
Trump 1 165 27
thought 1 165 27
through 1 165 27
where 1 165 27
we 1 165 27
are 1 165 27
going 1 165 27
with 1 165 27
this 1 165 27
deepening 1 165 27
commitment 1 165 27
in 1 165 27
Syria, 1 165 27
where 0 165 27
we 0 165 27
have 0 165 27
only 0 165 27
2,000 0 165 27
troops 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
no 0 165 27
allies 0 165 27
but 0 165 27
the 0 165 27
Kurds, 0 165 27
while 0 165 27
on 0 165 27
the 0 165 27
other 0 165 27
side 0 165 27
is 0 165 27
the 0 165 27
Syrian 0 165 27
army, 0 165 27
Hezbollah, 0 165 27
Russia 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
Iran, 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
Shiite 0 165 27
militias 0 165 27
from 0 165 27
Iraq, 0 165 27
Afghanistan 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
Pakistan? 0 165 27

Clearly, 0 165 28
we 0 165 28
have 0 165 28
an 0 165 28
obligation 0 165 28
not 0 165 28
to 0 165 28
abandon 0 165 28
the 0 165 28
Kurds, 0 165 28
who 0 165 28
took 0 165 28
most 0 165 28
of 0 165 28
the 0 165 28
casualties 0 165 28
in 0 165 28
liberating 0 165 28
eastern 0 165 28
Syria 0 165 28
from 0 165 28
ISIS. 0 165 28

And 0 165 29
we 0 165 29
have 0 165 29
a 0 165 29
strategic 0 165 29
interest 0 165 29
in 0 165 29
not 0 165 29
losing 0 165 29
Turkey 0 165 29
as 0 165 29
an 0 165 29
ally. 0 165 29

But 0 165 30
this 0 165 30
calls 0 165 30
for 0 165 30
active 1 165 30
diplomacy, 1 165 30
not 1 165 30
military 1 165 30
action. 1 165 30

And 0 165 31
now 0 165 31
that 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
rebels 0 165 31
have 0 165 31
been 0 165 31
defeated 0 165 31
and 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
civil 0 165 31
war 0 165 31
is 0 165 31
almost 0 165 31
over, 0 165 31
what 0 165 31
would 0 165 31
be 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
cost 0 165 31
and 0 165 31
what 0 165 31
would 0 165 31
be 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
prospects 0 165 31
of 0 165 31
fighting 0 165 31
a 0 165 31
new 0 165 31
and 0 165 31
wider 0 165 31
war? 0 165 31

What 0 165 32
would 0 165 32
victory 0 165 32
look 0 165 32
like? 0 165 32

Bibi 0 165 33
and 0 165 33
the 0 165 33
FDD 0 165 33
want 0 165 33
to 0 165 33
see 0 165 33
U.S. 0 165 33
power 0 165 33
deployed 0 165 33
alongside 0 165 33
that 0 165 33
of 0 165 33
Israel, 0 165 33
against 0 165 33
Iran, 0 165 33
Assad 0 165 33
and 0 165 33
Hezbollah. 0 165 33

But 0 165 34
while 0 165 34
Israel's 0 165 34
interests 0 165 34
are 0 165 34
clear, 0 165 34
what 1 165 34
would 1 165 34
be 1 165 34
the 1 165 34
U.S. 1 165 34
vital 1 165 34
interest? 1 165 34

What 1 165 35
outcome 1 165 35
would 1 165 35
justify 1 165 35
another 1 165 35
U.S. 1 165 35
war 1 165 35
in 1 165 35
a 1 165 35
region 1 165 35
where 1 165 35
all 1 165 35
the 1 165 35
previous 1 165 35
wars 1 165 35
in 1 165 35
this 1 165 35
century 1 165 35
have 1 165 35
left 1 165 35
us 1 165 35
bleeding, 1 165 35
bankrupt, 1 165 35
divided 1 165 35
and 1 165 35
disillusioned? 1 165 35

When 1 165 36
he 1 165 36
was 1 165 36
running 1 165 36
, 1 165 36
Donald 1 165 36

seemed 1 165 36
to 1 165 36
understand 1 165 36
this. 1 165 36

to 0 166 9
the 0 166 9
idea 0 166 9
to 0 166 9
offer 0 166 9
homosexual 0 166 9
couples 0 166 9
a 0 166 9
blessing. 0 166 9

Why 1 166 10
not, 1 166 10
one 1 166 10
could 1 166 10
say, 1 166 10
since 1 166 10
the 1 166 10
Church 1 166 10
is 1 166 10
ready 1 166 10
to 1 166 10
bless 1 166 10
nearly 1 166 10
everything 1 166 10
on 1 166 10
the 1 166 10
earth? 1 166 10

Now, 0 166 11
the 0 166 11
Church 0 166 11
especially 0 166 11
blesses 0 166 11
people, 0 166 11
but 0 166 11
also 0 166 11
deeds 0 166 11
and 0 166 11
objects. 0 166 11

The 0 166 12
Jesuit 0 166 12
Father 0 166 12
Eckhard 0 166 12

in 0 166 12
the 0 166 12
Internet 0 166 12
about 0 166 12
Catholic 0 166 12
blessings: 0 166 12

For 0 166 13
Catholics, 0 166 13
really 0 166 13
everything 0 166 13
can 0 166 13
be 0 166 13
blessed, 0 166 13
not 0 166 13
only 0 166 13
places 0 166 13
of 0 166 13
worship, 0 166 13
chalices, 0 166 13
and 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
faithful 0 166 13
after 0 166 13
each 0 166 13
prayer 0 166 13
service 0 166 13
– 0 166 13
whether 0 166 13
after 0 166 13
a 0 166 13
Mass, 0 166 13
or 0 166 13
after 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
prayers 0 166 13
for 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
hours 0 166 13
of 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
day. 0 166 13

The 0 166 14
blessing 0 166 14
is 0 166 14
also 0 166 14
not 0 166 14
limited 0 166 14
to 0 166 14
rosaries 0 166 14
or 0 166 14
religious 0 166 14
medal, 0 166 14
but 0 166 14
one 0 166 14
may 0 166 14
also 0 166 14
bless 0 166 14
cars, 0 166 14
factory 0 166 14
halls, 0 166 14
animals, 0 166 14
herbs, 0 166 14
and 0 166 14
much 0 166 14
more. 0 166 14

Some 0 166 15
blessings 0 166 15
are 0 166 15
only 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
be 0 166 15
made 0 166 15
by 0 166 15
priests 0 166 15
and 0 166 15
deacons, 0 166 15
especially 0 166 15
when 0 166 15
it 0 166 15
is 0 166 15
about 0 166 15
objects 0 166 15
of 0 166 15
worship 0 166 15
such 0 166 15
as 0 166 15
chalices 0 166 15
or 0 166 15
vestments. 0 166 15

But 0 166 16
parents 0 166 16
can 0 166 16
bless 0 166 16
their 0 166 16
children. 0 166 16

The 0 166 17
faithful 0 166 17
may 0 166 17
also 0 166 17
take 0 166 17
home 0 166 17
holy 0 166 17
water 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
sprinkle 0 166 17
it 0 166 17
on 0 166 17
members 0 166 17
of 0 166 17
the 0 166 17
family, 0 166 17
but 0 166 17
also 0 166 17
the 0 166 17
stable 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
the 0 166 17
animals, 0 166 17
thus 0 166 17
blessing 0 166 17
them. 0 166 17

[...] 0 166 18

What 0 166 19
kind 0 166 19
of 0 166 19
hope 0 166 19
is 0 166 19
connected 0 166 19
with 0 166 19
a 0 166 19
blessing? 0 166 19

With 0 166 20
regard 0 166 20
to 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
car, 0 166 20
certainly 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
wish 0 166 20
for 0 166 20
heavenly 0 166 20
protection 0 166 20
– 0 166 20
sometimes 0 166 20
also 0 166 20
expressed 0 166 20
with 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
help 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
a 0 166 20
medal 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
St. 0 166 20
Christopher, 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
patron 0 166 20
saint 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
car 0 166 20
drivers. 0 166 20

With 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
weather 0 166 21
blessing, 0 166 21
one 0 166 21
prays 0 166 21
explicitly 0 166 21
for 0 166 21
protection 0 166 21
against 0 166 21
hail, 0 166 21
lightning 0 166 21
and 0 166 21
drought. 0 166 21

[…] 0 166 22

To 1 166 23
bless 1 166 23
always 1 166 23
means 1 166 23
that 1 166 23
something 1 166 23
shall 1 166 23
flourish, 1 166 23
because 1 166 23
only 1 166 23
then 1 166 23
when 1 166 23
there 1 166 23
is 1 166 23
a 1 166 23
blessing 1 166 23
upon 1 166 23
a 1 166 23
cause 1 166 23
or 1 166 23
a 1 166 23
project, 1 166 23
will 1 166 23
something 1 166 23
good 1 166 23
come 1 166 23
out 1 166 23
of 1 166 23
it. 1 166 23

The 0 166 24
blessing 0 166 24
comes 0 166 24
from 0 166 24
God, 0 166 24
He 0 166 24
is 0 166 24
being 0 166 24
addressed 0 166 24
in 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
form 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
a 0 166 24
request; 0 166 24
and 0 166 24
it 0 166 24
is 0 166 24
given 0 166 24
to 0 166 24
people, 0 166 24
objects, 0 166 24
and 0 166 24
buildings, 0 166 24
with 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
help 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
sign 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
cross, 0 166 24
holy 0 166 24
water, 0 166 24
and 0 166 24
incense. 0 166 24

[…] 0 166 25

But 0 166 26
now 0 166 26
concerning 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
question 0 166 26
of 0 166 26
Cardinal 0 166 26
Marx, 0 166 26
and 0 166 26
not 0 166 26
a 0 166 26
few 0 166 26
of 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
priests, 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
answer 0 166 26
is 0 166 26
simple: 0 166 26
one 0 166 26
may 0 166 26
ask 0 166 26
for 0 166 26
God's 0 166 26
blessing 0 166 26
for 0 166 26
sinners, 0 166 26
but 0 166 26
not 0 166 26
for 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
sin. 0 166 26

That 1 166 27
is 1 166 27
to 1 166 27
say, 1 166 27
one 1 166 27
could 1 166 27
not 1 166 27
consecrate 1 166 27
a 1 166 27
brothel, 1 166 27
one 1 166 27
could 1 166 27
not 1 166 27
bless 1 166 27
a 1 166 27
concentration 1 166 27
camp 1 166 27
or 1 166 27
weapons 1 166 27
which 1 166 27
are 1 166 27
not 1 166 27
explicitly 1 166 27
ordained 1 166 27
for 1 166 27
hunting 1 166 27
or 1 166 27
for 1 166 27
legitimate 1 166 27
self-defense. 1 166 27

Therefore 0 166 28
it 0 166 28
is 0 166 28
clear 0 166 28
that 0 166 28
one 1 166 28
may 1 166 28
not 1 166 28
bless 1 166 28
a 1 166 28
relationship 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
is 1 166 28
sinful; 1 166 28
[one 1 166 28
may 1 166 28
not 1 166 28
bless] 1 166 28
the 1 166 28
mafia; 1 166 28
no 1 166 28
blessing 1 166 28
for 1 166 28
organizations 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
institutions 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
promote 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
procure 1 166 28
abortions 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
propagate 1 166 28
ideologies 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
are 1 166 28
against 1 166 28
the 1 166 28
Faith, 1 166 28
antisemitic 1 166 28
contents, 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
other 1 166 28
forms 1 166 28
of 1 166 28
racist 1 166 28
thought. 1 166 28

If 1 166 29
one 1 166 29
considers 1 166 29
and 1 166 29
weighs 1 166 29
this 1 166 29
matter, 1 166 29
one 1 166 29
knows: 1 166 29
one 1 166 29
may 1 166 29
not 1 166 29
bless 1 166 29
a 1 166 29
union 1 166 29
of 1 166 29
two 1 166 29
homosexual 1 166 29
men 1 166 29
or 1 166 29
of 1 166 29
lesbian 1 166 29
women. 1 166 29

Of 0 166 30
course 0 166 30
[one 0 166 30
could 0 166 30
bless] 0 166 30
two 0 166 30
men 0 166 30
or 0 166 30
women 0 166 30
who 0 166 30
are 0 166 30
de 0 166 30
facto 0 166 30
homosexual, 0 166 30
and 0 166 30
that 0 166 30
it 0 166 30
what 0 166 30
happens 0 166 30
in 0 166 30
each 0 166 30
Holy 0 166 30
Mass 0 166 30
which 0 166 30
is 0 166 30
being 0 166 30
attended 0 166 30
by 0 166 30
them. 0 166 30

This 0 166 31
blessing 0 166 31
– 0 166 31
which 0 166 31
is 0 166 31
not 0 166 31
related 0 166 31
to 0 166 31
their 0 166 31
acts 0 166 31
– 0 166 31
is 0 166 31
being 0 166 31
received 0 166 31
also 0 166 31
by 0 166 31
all 0 166 31
the 0 166 31
other 0 166 31
sinners, 0 166 31
and 0 166 31
the 0 166 31
Church 0 166 31
thereby 0 166 31
hopes 0 166 31
that 0 166 31
they 0 166 31
will 0 166 31
convert 0 166 31
under 0 166 31
the 0 166 31
influence 0 166 31
of 0 166 31
God's 0 166 31
Grace! 0 166 31

This 1 166 32
position 1 166 32
which 1 166 32
is 1 166 32
really 1 166 32
simple 1 166 32
and 1 166 32
easily 1 166 32
to 1 166 32
be 1 166 32
understood 1 166 32
has 0 166 32
been 0 166 32
clearly 0 166 32
and 0 166 32
convincingly 0 166 32
presented 0 166 32
– 0 166 32
since 0 166 32
the 0 166 32
statement 0 166 32
of 0 166 32
the 0 166 32
two 0 166 32
bishops 0 166 32
[Marx 0 166 32
and 0 166 32
Bode] 0 166 32
– 0 166 32
by 0 166 32
several 0 166 32
Christians: 0 166 32
by 0 166 32
Archbishops 0 166 32
Ludwig 0 166 32
Schick 0 166 32
(Germany) 0 166 32
and 0 166 32
Charles 0 166 32
Chaput 0 166 32
(USA); 0 166 32
by 0 166 32
the 0 166 32
German-speaking 0 166 32
theologians 0 166 32
Hubert 0 166 32
Windisch 0 166 32
and 0 166 32
Markus 0 166 32
Büning. 0 166 32

I 1 166 33
am 1 166 33
sure 1 166 33
there 1 166 33
are 1 166 33
many 1 166 33
many 1 166 33
others, 1 166 33
too, 1 166 33
who 1 166 33
think 1 166 33
alike, 1 166 33
but 1 166 33
whom 1 166 33
I 1 166 33
do 1 166 33
not 1 166 33
know. 1 166 33

Dear 1 166 34
Cardinal 1 166 34
Marx 1 166 34
and 1 166 34
dear 1 166 34
Bishop 1 166 34
Bode, 1 166 34
there 1 166 34
is 1 166 34
only 1 166 34
one 1 166 34
Catholic 1 166 34
answer: 1 166 34
No! 1 166 34

And 1 166 35
your 1 166 35
addition 1 166 35
“in 1 166 35
individual 1 166 35
cases” 1 166 35
is 1 166 35
absolutely 1 166 35
worthless, 1 166 35
it 1 166 35
has 1 166 35
no 1 166 35
argumentative 1 166 35
force. 1 166 35

What 0 166 36
would 0 166 36
St. 0 166 36
John 0 166 36
the 0 166 36
Baptist 0 166 36
have 0 166 36
said 0 166 36
if 0 166 36
Herod, 0 166 36
taking 0 166 36
for 0 166 36
himself 0 166 36
his 0 166 36
brother's 0 166 36
wife, 0 166 36
would 0 166 36
have 0 166 36
excusingly 0 166 36
called 0 166 36
himself 0 166 36
an 0 166 36
“individual 0 166 36
case”! 0 166 36

The 0 166 37
idea 0 166 37
to 0 166 37
bless 0 166 37
sinful 0 166 37
conduct 0 166 37
is 0 166 37
really 0 166 37
what 0 166 37
Isaiah 0 166 37
described 0 166 37
quite 0 166 37
vividly, 0 166 37
as 0 166 37
follows: 0 166 37
“Woe 0 166 37
to 0 166 37
you 0 166 37
that 0 166 37
call 0 166 37
evil 0 166 37
good, 0 166 37
and 0 166 37
good 0 166 37
evil: 0 166 37
that 0 166 37
put 0 166 37
darkness 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
light, 0 166 37
and 0 166 37
light 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
darkness: 0 166 37
that 0 166 37
put 0 166 37
bitter 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
sweet, 0 166 37
and 0 166 37
sweet 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
bitter.” 0 166 37
[Isaiah 0 166 37
5:20] 0 166 37

Is 0 166 38
this 0 166 38
not 0 166 38
exactly 0 166 38
what 0 166 38
Cardinal 0 166 38
Marx 0 166 38
– 0 166 38
and 0 166 38
others 0 166 38
who 0 166 38
are 0 166 38
thinking 0 166 38
like 0 166 38
him 0 166 38
– 0 166 38
are 0 166 38
doing? 0 166 38

If 0 166 39
one 0 166 39
were 0 166 39
to 0 166 39
place 0 166 39
on 0 166 39
a 0 166 39
bottle 0 166 39
of 0 166 39
sour 0 166 39
cucumbers 0 166 39
a 0 166 39
tag 0 166 39
“honey,” 0 166 39
the 0 166 39
cucumbers 0 166 39
still 0 166 39
remain 0 166 39
sour! 0 166 39

Even 0 166 40
blessing 0 166 40
bishops 0 166 40
cannot 0 166 40
change 0 166 40
that. 0 166 40

Nor 0 166 41
can 0 166 41
the 0 166 41
pope, 0 166 41
in 0 166 41
calling 0 166 41
for 0 166 41
a 0 166 41
cultural 0 166 41
revolution, 0 166 41
especially 0 166 41
since 0 166 41
he 0 166 41
does 0 166 41
not 0 166 41
explain 0 166 41
what 0 166 41
he 0 166 41
exactly 0 166 41
means 0 166 41
by 0 166 41
it. 0 166 41

He 0 166 42
says 0 166 42
that 0 166 42
he 0 166 42
“allows 0 166 42
himself” 0 166 42
to 0 166 42
talk 0 166 42
like 0 166 42
that 0 166 42
– 0 166 42
but 1 166 42
if 1 166 42
one 1 166 42
dares 1 166 42
something, 1 166 42
one 1 166 42
might 1 166 42
win, 1 166 42
but 1 166 42
one 1 166 42
also 1 166 42
can 1 166 42
perish. 1 166 42

That 0 166 43
seems 0 166 43
to 0 166 43
catch 0 166 43
on 0 166 43
these 0 166 43
days. 0 166 43

For 0 166 44
example, 0 166 44
the 0 166 44
Italian 0 166 44
moral 0 166 44
theologian, 0 166 44
Maurizio 0 166 44
Chiodi, 0 166 44
recently 0 166 44
claimed 0 166 44
in 0 166 44
his 0 166 44
talk 0 166 44
at 0 166 44
the 0 166 44
Gregorian 0 166 44
Pontifical 0 166 44
University 0 166 44
that 0 166 44
contraception 0 166 44
is 0 166 44
sometimes 0 166 44
not 0 166 44
only 0 166 44
not 0 166 44
forbidden, 0 166 44
but 0 166 44
even 0 166 44
demanded! 0 166 44

To 1 166 45
contradict 1 166 45
two 1 166 45
popes 1 166 45
– 1 166 45
whom 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
Church 1 166 45
has 1 166 45
already 1 166 45
“beatified” 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
one 1 166 45
and 1 166 45
“canonized” 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
other 1 166 45
– 1 166 45
so 1 166 45
shortly 1 166 45
after 1 166 45
their 1 166 45
deaths, 1 166 45
and 1 166 45
in 1 166 45
such 1 166 45
a 1 166 45
radical 1 166 45
and 1 166 45
open 1 166 45
manner, 1 166 45
probably 1 166 45
has 1 166 45
never 1 166 45
happened 1 166 45
before 1 166 45
in 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
Church's 1 166 45
history. 1 166 45

Isaiah 1 166 46
says 1 166 46
that 1 166 46
such 1 166 46
people 1 166 46
draw 1 166 46
unto 1 166 46
them 1 166 46
God's 1 166 46
punishment, 1 166 46
with 1 166 46
thick 1 166 46
cords! 1 166 46

Nevertheless, 0 166 47
one 0 166 47
should 0 166 47
wish 0 166 47
for 0 166 47
Cardinal 0 166 47

Bishop 0 166 47

Chiodi 0 166 47
that 0 166 47
they 0 166 47
sleep 0 166 47
well. 0 166 47

Whether 0 166 47

their 0 166 47

conscience 0 166 47

will 0 166 47

allow 0 166 47

it, 0 166 47

is 0 166 47

not 0 166 47

so 0 166 47

certain; 0 166 47

but 0 166 47

if 0 166 47

it 0 166 47

does 0 166 47

not 0 166 47

[allow 0 166 47

it], 0 166 47

it 0 166 47

would 0 166 47

certainly 0 166 47

be 0 166 47

a 0 166 47

the 1 167 5

it 0 167 5
clear 0 167 5
what 0 167 5
he 0 167 5

about 0 167 5
the 0 167 5
recently 0 167 5

then 1 167 5
this 1 167 5
is 1 167 5
an 1 167 5
atrocity 1 167 5
at 1 167 5
a 1 167 5

According 0 167 6
to 0 167 6
the 0 167 6

report, 0 167 6
Cardinal 0 167 6
Müller 0 167 6
said 0 167 6
in 0 167 6
his 0 167 6
address 0 167 6
that 0 167 6
he 0 167 6
regrets 0 167 6
the 0 167 6
separation 0 167 6
of 0 167 6
the 0 167 6
Church's 0 167 6
doctrinal 0 167 6
and 0 167 6
moral 0 167 6
teaching 0 167 6
and 0 167 6
called 0 167 6
Christianity 0 167 6
a 0 167 6
“theocentric 1 167 6
humanism.” 1 167 6
He 0 167 6
said 0 167 6
the 0 167 6
“submissive 1 167 6
change 1 167 6
of 1 167 6
the 1 167 6
Church 1 167 6
into 1 167 6
a 1 167 6
NGO 1 167 6
for 1 167 6
the 1 167 6
embetterment 1 167 6
of 1 167 6
the 1 167 6
this-worldly 1 167 6
life 1 167 6
conditions” 1 167 6
is 1 167 6
a 1 167 6
“suicidal 1 167 6
modernization” 1 167 6
that 1 167 6
denies 1 167 6
mankind 1 167 6
the 1 167 6
Truth 1 167 6
of 1 167 6
God. 1 167 6

In 0 167 7
this 0 167 7
context, 0 167 7
the 0 167 7
German 0 167 7
cardinal 0 167 7
also 0 167 7
criticized 0 167 7
Martin 0 167 7
Luther's 0 167 7
own 0 167 7
denial 0 167 7
of 0 167 7
man's 0 167 7
free 0 167 7
will 0 167 7
and 0 167 7
his 0 167 7
teaching 0 167 7
about 0 167 7
the 0 167 7
total 0 167 7
depravity 0 167 7
of 0 167 7
man 0 167 7
that 0 167 7
separates 0 167 7
morality 0 167 7
from 0 167 7
the 0 167 7
relationship 0 167 7
with 0 167 7
God. 0 167 7

Morality, 0 167 8
Müller 0 167 8
explained, 0 167 8
is 0 167 8
rooted 0 167 8
in 0 167 8
Grace; 0 167 8
that 0 167 8
is 0 167 8
why 0 167 8
any 0 167 8
teaching 0 167 8
about 0 167 8
“rules 0 167 8
and 0 167 8
exceptions” 0 167 8
ignores 0 167 8
the 0 167 8
character 0 167 8
of 0 167 8
the 0 167 8
ethics 0 167 8
of 0 167 8
the 0 167 8
Covenant 0 167 8
and 0 167 8
of 0 167 8
Grace. 0 167 8

In 0 167 9
the 0 167 9
discussion 0 167 9
following 0 167 9
his 0 167 9
talk, 0 167 9
Cardinal 0 167 9
Müller 0 167 9
also 0 167 9
responded 0 167 9
to 0 167 9
questions 0 167 9
concerning 0 167 9
Pope 0 167 9
Francis' 0 167 9
post-synodal 0 167 9
exhortation, 0 167 9
Amoris 0 167 9
Laetitia. 0 167 9

The 0 167 10
cardinal 0 167 10
said 0 167 10
that 0 167 10
he 0 167 10
is 0 167 10
“not 0 167 10
happy” 0 167 10
about 0 167 10
the 0 167 10
fact 0 167 10
that 0 167 10
there 0 167 10
are 0 167 10
different 0 167 10
interpretations 0 167 10
of 0 167 10
this 0 167 10
papal 0 167 10
text 0 167 10
by 0 167 10
some 0 167 10
bishops' 0 167 10
conferences. 0 167 10

“In 1 167 11
dogmatic 1 167 11
questions, 1 167 11
there 1 167 11
cannot 1 167 11
be 1 167 11
a 1 167 11
plurality,” 1 167 11
he 0 167 11
added. 0 167 11

There 1 167 12
is 1 167 12
only 1 167 12
one 1 167 12
Magisterium, 1 167 12
he 1 167 12
said, 1 167 12
and 1 167 12
bishops' 1 167 12
conferences 1 167 12
can 1 167 12
only 1 167 12
decide 1 167 12
about 1 167 12
pastoral 1 167 12
questions. 1 167 12

Contradictory 0 167 13
conceptions 0 167 13
concerning 0 167 13
the 0 167 13
Sacraments, 0 167 13
said 0 167 13
the 0 167 13
cardinal, 0 167 13
lead 0 167 13
into 0 167 13
chaotic 0 167 13
conditions. 0 167 13

Thus, 0 167 14
explained 0 167 14
the 0 167 14
cardinal, 0 167 14
the 1 167 14
Sacraments 1 167 14
have 1 167 14
to 1 167 14
be 1 167 14
celebrated 1 167 14
the 1 167 14
way 1 167 14
Christ 1 167 14
Himself 1 167 14
willed 1 167 14
it 1 167 14
when 1 167 14
he 1 167 14
instituted 1 167 14
them. 1 167 14

The 0 167 15
controversial 0 167 15
eighth 0 167 15
chapter 0 167 15
of 0 167 15
Amoris 0 167 15
Laetitia 0 167 15
has 0 167 15
to 0 167 15
be 0 167 15
understood 0 167 15
“in 0 167 15
an 0 167 15
orthodox 0 167 15
way,” 0 167 15
namely 0 167 15
that 0 167 15
“he 1 167 15
who 1 167 15
lives 1 167 15
in 1 167 15
the 1 167 15
state 1 167 15
of 1 167 15
mortal 1 167 15
sin 1 167 15
cannot 1 167 15
receive 1 167 15
Holy 1 167 15
Communion.” 1 167 15
It 0 167 15
is, 0 167 15
in 0 167 15
Müller's 0 167 15
eyes, 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
pope's 0 167 15
duty 0 167 15
“to 0 167 15
unite 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
Church, 0 167 15
that 0 167 15
is 0 167 15
what 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
pope 0 167 15
is 0 167 15
there 0 167 15
for.” 0 167 15
This 0 167 15
is 0 167 15
what 0 167 15
he, 0 167 15
Müller, 0 167 15
himself 0 167 15
told 0 167 15
the 0 167 15
pope: 0 167 15
when 0 167 15
the 0 167 15

In 0 170 31

a 0 170 31

a 0 170 31

used 0 170 31
unit 0 170 31

some 0 170 31

referring 0 170 32

they 0 170 32

since 0 172 2
we 0 172 2
don’t 0 172 2
count 0 172 2
Pluto 0 172 2
as 0 172 2
a 0 172 2
planet 0 172 2
anymore 0 172 2
— 0 172 2
and 0 172 2
it 0 172 2
hasn’t 0 172 2
been 0 172 2
studied 0 172 2
with 0 172 2
the 0 172 2

of 0 172 2
many 0 172 2
of 0 172 2

Thankfully 0 172 3
the 0 172 3
Hubble 0 172 3
Space 0 172 3
Telescope 0 172 3
hasn’t 0 172 3
lost 0 172 3
interest 0 172 3
in 0 172 3
the 0 172 3
distant 0 172 3
planet, 0 172 3
because 0 172 3
it 0 172 3
just 0 172 3
captured 0 172 3
one 0 172 3
of 0 172 3
Neptunes 0 172 3
massive 0 172 3
storms 0 172 3
losing 0 172 3
steam 0 172 3
as 0 172 3
it 0 172 3
roars 0 172 3
across 0 172 3
the 0 172 3
planet. 0 172 3

Storms 0 172 4
on 0 172 4
Neptune 0 172 4
appear 0 172 4
as 0 172 4
giant 0 172 4
dark 0 172 4
ovals, 0 172 4
a 0 172 4
bit 0 172 4
like 0 172 4
Jupiter’s 0 172 4
Great 0 172 4
Red 0 172 4
Spot. 0 172 4

However, 0 172 5
unlike 0 172 5
Jupiter’s 0 172 5
centuries-old 0 172 5
storm, 0 172 5
Neptune’s 0 172 5
hurricane-like 0 172 5
weather 0 172 5
events 0 172 5
only 0 172 5
last 0 172 5
a 0 172 5
few 0 172 5

a 0 172 5
time 0 172 5
before 0 172 5
eventually 0 172 5
dissipating. 0 172 5

Of 0 172 6
course, 0 172 6
that’s 0 172 6
not 0 172 6
to 0 172 6
say 0 172 6
the 0 172 6
storms 0 172 6
are 0 172 6
insignificant 0 172 6
— 0 172 6
many 0 172 6
are 0 172 6
large 0 172 6
enough 0 172 6
to 0 172 6

a 0 172 6

The 0 172 7
planet, 0 172 7
which 0 172 7
NASA 0 172 7
says 0 172 7
is 0 172 7
the 0 172 7
windiest 0 172 7
in 0 172 7
our 0 172 7

spots 0 172 7
on 0 172 7
its 0 172 7
surface, 0 172 7
but 0 172 7
scientists 0 172 7
are 0 172 7
still 0 172 7
at 0 172 7
a 0 172 7
loss 0 172 7
as 0 172 7
to 0 172 7
how 0 172 7
they 0 172 7
actually 0 172 7
occur. 0 172 7

“We 0 172 8
have 0 172 8
no 0 172 8
evidence 0 172 8
of 0 172 8
how 0 172 8
these 0 172 8

are 0 172 8
formed 0 172 8
or 0 172 8
how 0 172 8
fast 0 172 8
they 0 172 8
rotate,” 0 172 8
Agustín 0 172 8

Basque 0 172 8
Country 0 172 8

explains. 0 172 8

“It 0 172 9
is 0 172 9
most 0 172 9
likely 0 172 9
that 0 172 9
they 0 172 9
arise 0 172 9
from 0 172 9
an 0 172 9
instability 0 172 9
in 0 172 9

The 0 172 10
observation 0 172 10
of 0 172 10
this 0 172 10
particular 0 172 10
storm 0 172 10
dying 0 172 10
out 0 172 10
is 0 172 10
significant 0 172 10
because 0 172 10
it’s 0 172 10
the 0 172 10
very 0 172 10
first 0 172 10
time 0 172 10
one 0 172 10
of 0 172 10
Neptune’s 0 172 10
storms 0 172 10
has 0 172 10
been 0 172 10
observed 0 172 10
in 0 172 10
such 0 172 10
a 0 172 10
way. 0 172 10

It 0 172 11
also 0 172 11
goes 0 172 11
against 0 172 11
everything 0 172 11
that 0 172 11
scientists 0 172 11
thought 0 172 11
they 0 172 11
knew 0 172 11
about 0 172 11
how 0 172 11

on 0 172 11
Neptune 0 172 11
live 0 172 11
and 0 172 11
die. 0 172 11

“It 0 172 12
looks 0 172 12
like 0 172 12
we’re 0 172 12
capturing 0 172 12
the 0 172 12
demise 0 172 12
of 0 172 12
this 0 172 12
dark 0 172 12
vortex, 0 172 12
and 0 172 12
it’s 0 172 12
different 0 172 12
from 0 172 12
what 0 172 12
well-known 0 172 12
studies 0 172 12
led 0 172 12
us 0 172 12
to 0 172 12
expect,” 0 172 12
said 0 172 12
Michael 0 172 12
H. 0 172 12
Wong 0 172 12
of 0 172 12

University 0 172 12
of 0 172 12
California 0 172 12
at 0 172 12
Berkeley 0 172 12
says. 0 172 12

“Their 0 172 13
dynamical 0 172 13
simulations 0 172 13
said 0 172 13
that 0 172 13
anticyclones 0 172 13
under 0 172 13
Neptune’s 0 172 13
wind 0 172 13
shear 0 172 13
would 0 172 13
probably 0 172 13
drift 0 172 13
toward 0 172 13
the 0 172 13
equator. 0 172 13

We 0 172 14
thought 0 172 14
that 0 172 14
once 0 172 14
the 0 172 14
vortex 0 172 14
got 0 172 14
too 0 172 14
close 0 172 14
to 0 172 14
the 0 172 14
equator, 0 172 14
it 0 172 14
would 0 172 14
break 0 172 14
up 0 172 14
and 0 172 14
perhaps 0 172 14
create 0 172 14
a 0 172 14
spectacular 0 172 14
outburst 0 172 14

but 0 173 37
that 0 173 37
this 0 173 37

They 0 173 41

Orban 0 175 12
is 0 175 12
widely 0 175 12
credited 0 175 12
for 0 175 12
reversing 0 175 12

has 0 175 13
used 0 175 13
methods 0 175 13
that 0 175 13
critics 0 175 13
have 0 175 13
called 0 175 13

dominates 0 175 15

now. 0 175 15

Orban 0 175 16
said 0 175 16
on 0 175 16

the 0 175 16

which 0 175 16
he 0 175 16
called 0 175 16
an 0 175 16
"immigrant 0 175 16
zone, 0 175 16

an 0 175 17
increasingly 1 175 17
vicious 1 175 17

Orban 0 175 30

he 0 175 30
anticipated 0 175 30
that 0 175 30

Pope 0 177 4

commission 0 177 4
on 0 177 4

Following 0 177 5

he 0 177 5
was 0 177 5
not 0 177 5

on 0 177 5
halting 0 177 5

within 0 177 5

O’Malley 0 177 6

The 0 177 7
revelations 0 177 7
about 0 177 7
Law, 0 177 7
who 0 177 7
died 0 177 7

up 0 177 7
about 0 177 7

priests 0 177 7
who 0 177 7
had 0 177 7
molested 0 177 7
them. 0 177 7

When 0 177 8
he 0 177 8
created 0 177 8
the 0 177 8
commission, 0 177 8
Francis 0 177 8
said: 0 177 8
“The 0 177 8
commission’s 0 177 8
specific 0 177 8
task 0 177 8
is 0 177 8
to 0 177 8
propose 0 177 8
to 0 177 8
me 0 177 8
the 0 177 8
most 0 177 8
opportune 0 177 8
initiatives 0 177 8
for 0 177 8
protecting 0 177 8

vulnerable 0 177 8
adults, 0 177 8
in 0 177 8
order 0 177 8
that 0 177 8
we 0 177 8
may 0 177 8
do 0 177 8
everything 0 177 8
possible 0 177 8
to 0 177 8
ensure 0 177 8
that 0 177 8
crimes 0 177 8
such 0 177 8
as 0 177 8
those 0 177 8
which 0 177 8
have 0 177 8

longer 0 177 8
repeated 0 177 8
in 0 177 8

Why 0 177 9
is 0 177 9
it 0 177 9
being 0 177 9
renewed 0 177 9
now? 0 177 9

What 0 177 13
did 0 177 13
the 0 177 13
first 0 177 13
commission 0 177 13
achieve? 0 177 13

The 0 177 14
Vatican 0 177 14
has 0 177 14
said 0 177 14
it 0 177 14
“worked 0 177 14
with 0 177 14
almost 0 177 14
200 0 177 14
dioceses 0 177 14
and 0 177 14

schools, 0 177 14
hospitals, 0 177 14
and 0 177 14
other 0 177 14
institutions.” 0 177 14

What 0 177 15
didn’t 0 177 15
it 0 177 15
do? 0 177 15

Commission 0 177 16
members 0 177 16
quickly 0 177 16
realized 0 177 16
they 0 177 16
needed 0 177 16
to 0 177 16
go 0 177 16
beyond 0 177 16
raising 0 177 16
awareness 0 177 16
and 0 177 16
deal 0 177 16
with 0 177 16
the 0 177 16
bishops 0 177 16
who 0 177 16
quietly 0 177 16
shift 0 177 16
offenders 0 177 16
to 0 177 16
new 0 177 16
dioceses 0 177 16
when 0 177 16
they 0 177 16
are 0 177 16
exposed 0 177 16
as 0 177 16
molesters 0 177 16
and 0 177 16
rapists. 0 177 16

Even 0 177 17
if 0 177 17
church 0 177 17
laws 0 177 17
already 0 177 17
existed 0 177 17
to 0 177 17
hold 0 177 17
bishops 0 177 17
accountable 0 177 17
for 0 177 17
their 0 177 17
priests’ 0 177 17
behavior, 0 177 17
those 0 177 17
strictures 0 177 17
were 0 177 17
not 0 177 17
enough, 0 177 17
O’Malley 0 177 17
said 0 177 17
in 0 177 17
2014. 0 177 17

“There 0 177 18
are, 0 177 18
theoretically 0 177 18
I 0 177 18
guess, 0 177 18
canons 0 177 18
that 0 177 18
could 0 177 18
apply 0 177 18
here, 0 177 18
but 0 177 18
obviously 0 177 18
they 0 177 18
have 0 177 18
not 0 177 18
been 0 177 18
sufficient,” 0 177 18
he 0 177 18
said. 0 177 18

The 0 177 19
commission 0 177 19
was 0 177 19
behind 0 177 19
Francis’ 0 177 19
decision 0 177 19
in 0 177 19
2015 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
create 0 177 19
a 0 177 19
new 0 177 19
tribunal 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
judge 0 177 19
bishops 0 177 19
caught 0 177 19
covering 0 177 19
up 0 177 19
for 0 177 19
abusive 1 177 19
priests, 1 177 19
and 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
fund 0 177 19
it 0 177 19
for 0 177 19
five 0 177 19
years. 0 177 19

But 0 177 20
amid 0 177 20
myriad 0 177 20
legal 0 177 20
questions 0 177 20
over 0 177 20
what 0 177 20
exact 0 177 20
powers 0 177 20
the 0 177 20
court 0 177 20
would 0 177 20
have, 0 177 20
it 0 177 20
never 0 177 20
got 0 177 20
off 0 177 20
the 0 177 20
ground. 0 177 20

In 0 177 21
2016, 0 177 21
Francis 0 177 21
officially 0 177 21
killed 0 177 21
the 0 177 21
plan 0 177 21
to 0 177 21
create 0 177 21
it, 0 177 21
issuing 0 177 21
a 0 177 21
document 0 177 21
that 0 177 21
essentially 0 177 21
called 0 177 21
on 0 177 21
using 0 177 21
existing 0 177 21
procedures 0 177 21
to 0 177 21
tackle 0 177 21
the 0 177 21
problem. 0 177 21

Francis 0 177 22
was 0 177 22
also 0 177 22
criticized 0 177 22
when 0 177 22
Australian 0 177 22
Cardinal 0 177 22
George 0 177 22
Pell, 0 177 22
whom 0 177 22
he 0 177 22
had 0 177 22
brought 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
Rome 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
clean 0 177 22
up 0 177 22
Vatican 0 177 22
finances, 0 177 22
was 0 177 22
forced 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
return 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
Australia 0 177 22
last 0 177 22
year 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
face 0 177 22
charges 0 177 22
of 0 177 22
sexual 0 177 22
assault. 0 177 22

Any 0 177 23
other 0 177 23
problems? 0 177 23

Commission 0 177 24
members 0 177 24
said 0 177 24
bishops 0 177 24
should 0 177 24
call 0 177 24
the 0 177 24

But 0 177 25
this 0 177 25
simple 0 177 25

hard 0 177 25

across. 0 177 25

It 0 177 26
emerged 0 177 26

a 0 177 26

every 0 177 26

so. 0 177 26

Did 0 177 27

Not 0 177 28
all 0 177 28

In 0 177 36
2015, 0 177 36

covered 0 177 37
up 0 177 37
by 0 177 37
Juan 0 177 37
Barros, 0 177 37
a 0 177 37
priest 0 177 37
whose 0 177 37
appointment 0 177 37
as 0 177 37
a 0 177 37
bishop 0 177 37
in 0 177 37
2015 0 177 37
prompted 0 177 37
huge 0 177 37
protests 0 177 37
in 0 177 37
Chile. 0 177 37

The 0 177 38
pope 0 177 38
has 0 177 38
stuck 0 177 38
by 0 177 38
Barros, 0 177 38
dismissing 0 177 38
the 0 177 38
protesters 0 177 38
as 0 177 38
“lefties” 1 177 38
and 0 177 38
hugging 0 177 38
Barros 0 177 38
publicly 0 177 38
during 0 177 38
his 0 177 38
visit 0 177 38
to 0 177 38
Chile 0 177 38
last 0 177 38

"I 0 177 39
can't 0 177 39
condemn 0 177 39
[Barros] 0 177 39
because 0 177 39
I 0 177 39
don't 0 177 39
have 0 177 39
evidence," 0 177 39
he 0 177 39
said 0 177 39
on 0 177 39
the 0 177 39
plane 0 177 39
back 0 177 39
to 0 177 39
Rome, 0 177 39
suggesting 0 177 39
he 0 177 39
had 0 177 39
ignored 0 177 39
or 0 177 39
never 0 177 39
read 0 177 39
the 0 177 39
letter 0 177 39
from 0 177 39
Cruz. 0 177 39

That 0 177 40
was 0 177 40
too 0 177 40
much 0 177 40
for 0 177 40
O’Malley, 0 177 40
who 0 177 40
said 0 177 40
Francis 0 177 40
had 1 177 40
caused 1 177 40
"great 1 177 40
pain” 1 177 40
to 1 177 40
victims. 1 177 40

If 1 177 41
Francis 1 177 41
was 1 177 41
not 1 177 41
listening 1 177 41
to 1 177 41
the 1 177 41
commission 1 177 41
about 1 177 41
Barros, 1 177 41
whom 1 177 41
was 1 177 41
he 1 177 41
listening 1 177 41
to? 1 177 41

Vatican 0 177 42
watchers 0 177 42
believe 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
pope 0 177 42
was 0 177 42
influenced 0 177 42
by 0 177 42
Chilean 0 177 42
Cardinal 0 177 42
Francisco 0 177 42
Javier 0 177 42
Errazuriz, 0 177 42
a 0 177 42
member 0 177 42
of 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
G9 0 177 42
group 0 177 42
who 0 177 42
has 0 177 42
backed 0 177 42
Barros 0 177 42
and 0 177 42
reportedly 0 177 42
helped 0 177 42
block 0 177 42
moves 0 177 42
to 0 177 42
make 0 177 42
Cruz 0 177 42
a 0 177 42
member 0 177 42
of 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
abuse 0 177 42
commission. 0 177 42

So 0 177 43
is 0 177 43
the 0 177 43
pope 0 177 43
intransigent 0 177 43
on 0 177 43
Barros? 0 177 43

No. 0 177 44

Something 0 177 45
changed 0 177 45
his 0 177 45
mind 0 177 45
after 0 177 45
his 0 177 45
Chilean 0 177 45
trip, 0 177 45
possibly 0 177 45
the 0 177 45
scale 0 177 45
of 0 177 45
the 0 177 45

in 0 177 45

now 0 177 46
lives 0 177 46
in 0 177 46

"For 0 177 47
the 0 177 47

I 0 177 47
felt 0 177 47

is 0 177 47
listening," 0 177 47
Cruz 0 177 47
said 0 177 47
after 0 177 47
the 0 177 47
meeting. 0 177 47

What 0 177 48
happens 0 177 48
next? 0 177 48

“This 0 177 49
should 0 177 49
lead 0 177 49

stepping 0 177 49
down,” 0 177 49

The 1 182 16

is 1 182 16
so 1 182 16
much 1 182 16
bigger 1 182 16
than 1 182 16
Farrakhan 1 182 16

it 0 182 17
ain’t 0 182 17
my 0 182 17
thing,” 0 182 17
he 0 182 17
said 0 182 17

The 1 182 18
people 1 182 18
who 1 182 18
talk 1 182 18
about 1 182 18
the 1 182 18

are 1 182 18
generally 1 182 18
anti-Semites. 1 182 18

Somehow 0 182 19
I 0 182 19
don't 0 182 19
think 0 182 19
a 0 182 19
white 0 182 19
congressman 0 182 19
would 0 182 19
get 0 182 19
away 0 182 19
with 0 182 19
saying 0 182 19
that 0 182 19
he 0 182 19
agrees 0 182 19
with 0 182 19
David 0 182 19
Duke 0 182 19
on 0 182 19
the 0 182 19
environment 0 182 19
but 0 182 19
isn't 0 182 19
especially 0 182 19
concerned 0 182 19
about 0 182 19
his 0 182 19
racism. 0 182 19

But 0 182 20
black 0 182 20
leaders 0 182 20
have 0 182 20
gotten 0 182 20
away 0 182 20
with 0 182 20
playing 0 182 20
that 0 182 20
game 0 182 20
with 0 182 20
Farrakhan 0 182 20
repeatedly. 0 182 20

But 0 182 21
the 0 182 21
ADL 0 182 21
and 0 182 21
the 0 182 21
JTA 0 182 21
will 0 182 21
whitewash 1 182 21
this 0 182 21
again. 0 182 21

And 1 182 21

if 1 182 21

they 1 182 21

can't 1 182 21

whitewash 1 182 21

this, 1 182 21

they'll 1 182 21

leads 0 187 62
the 0 187 62

“The 0 187 63
confiscations 0 187 63
only 0 187 63
last 0 187 63
a 0 187 63
year, 0 187 63
although 0 187 63
they 0 187 63
can 0 187 63
be 0 187 63
renewed.” 0 187 63

See 0 187 64
the 0 187 64

Seattle 0 187 65
Police 0 187 65
First 0 187 65
In 0 187 65
State 0 187 65
To 0 187 65
Seize 0 187 65
Gun 0 187 65
Under 0 187 65
Mental 0 187 65
Health 0 187 65
Law 0 187 65

A 0 187 66
few 0 187 66
observations 0 187 66
are 0 187 66
in 0 187 66
order 0 187 66
here: 0 187 66

First, 1 187 67
the 1 187 67
open 1 187 67
carry 1 187 67
of 1 187 67
a 1 187 67
firearm 1 187 67
is 1 187 67
LEGAL 1 187 67
in 1 187 67
the 1 187 67
area 1 187 67
where 1 187 67
this 1 187 67
took 1 187 67
place. 1 187 67

So, 1 187 68
the 1 187 68
fellow 1 187 68
was 1 187 68
violating 1 187 68
NO 1 187 68
gun 1 187 68
laws 1 187 68
whatsoever. 1 187 68

Plus, 0 187 69
he 0 187 69
never 0 187 69
removed 0 187 69
the 0 187 69
pistol 0 187 69
from 0 187 69
its 0 187 69
holster 0 187 69
or 0 187 69
brandished 0 187 69
it 0 187 69
in 0 187 69
any 0 187 69
way. 0 187 69

Secondly, 0 187 70
the 0 187 70
man 0 187 70
was 0 187 70
“known” 0 187 70
to 0 187 70
nearby 0 187 70
bars 0 187 70
and 0 187 70
restaurants 0 187 70
near 0 187 70
his 0 187 70
place 0 187 70
of 0 187 70
residence. 0 187 70

That 0 187 71
means 0 187 71
nothing. 0 187 71

Known 0 187 72
for 0 187 72
what? 0 187 72

The 0 187 73
report 0 187 73
doesn’t 0 187 73
even 0 187 73
say 0 187 73
the 0 187 73
man 0 187 73
was 0 187 73
known 0 187 73
for 0 187 73
acting 0 187 73
weirdly 0 187 73
or 0 187 73
strangely. 0 187 73

It 0 187 74
just 0 187 74
says 0 187 74
he 0 187 74
was 0 187 74
“known.” 0 187 74
And 0 187 74
even 0 187 74
if 0 187 74
he 0 187 74
did 0 187 74
act 0 187 74
weirdly 0 187 74
or 0 187 74
strangely, 0 187 74
if 0 187 74
we 0 187 74
denied 0 187 74
constitutional 0 187 74
rights 0 187 74
to 0 187 74
everyone 0 187 74
in 0 187 74
that 0 187 74
category, 0 187 74
a 0 187 74
majority 0 187 74
of 0 187 74
Americans 0 187 74
would 0 187 74
have 0 187 74
no 0 187 74
rights, 0 187 74
and 1 187 74
ALL 1 187 74
of 1 187 74
Congress 1 187 74
would 1 187 74
have 1 187 74
no 1 187 74
rights. 1 187 74

Thirdly, 1 187 75
what 1 187 75
does 1 187 75
“volume 1 187 75
of 1 187 75
complaints” 1 187 75
mean? 1 187 75

How 1 187 76
many 1 187 76
complaints 1 187 76
were 1 187 76
received 1 187 76
over 1 187 76
a 1 187 76
YEAR’S 1 187 76
time? 1 187 76

Two? 1 187 77

Five? 1 187 78

Ten? 1 187 79

People 1 187 80
complaining 1 187 80
about 1 187 80
other 1 187 80
people 1 187 80
happens 1 187 80
all 1 187 80
of 1 187 80
the 1 187 80
time. 1 187 80

Plus, 0 187 81
if 0 187 81
complaints 0 187 81
had 0 187 81
been 0 187 81
received 0 187 81
over 0 187 81
the 0 187 81
course 0 187 81
of 0 187 81
an 0 187 81
entire 0 187 81
year 0 187 81
and 0 187 81
police 0 187 81
just 0 187 81
now 0 187 81
decided 0 187 81
to 0 187 81
act, 0 187 81
the 0 187 81
man 0 187 81
must 0 187 81
not 0 187 81
have 0 187 81
been 0 187 81
considered 0 187 81
much 0 187 81
of 0 187 81
a 0 187 81
threat. 0 187 81

Fourthly, 0 187 82
there 0 187 82
was 0 187 82
NO 1 187 82
report 0 187 82
of 0 187 82
the 0 187 82
man 0 187 82
“exhibiting 0 187 82
violent 0 187 82
behavior,” 0 187 82
as 0 187 82
the 0 187 82
police 0 187 82
sergeant 0 187 82
claims. 0 187 82

The 0 187 83
report 0 187 83
says 0 187 83
“he 0 187 83
had 0 187 83
been 0 187 83
intimidating 0 187 83
people.” 0 187 83
How? 0 187 83

No 0 187 84
specifics 0 187 84
except 0 187 84
to 0 187 84
say 0 187 84
he 0 187 84
was 0 187 84
“staring” 0 187 84
at 0 187 84
people. 0 187 84

Wow! 1 187 85

Run 1 187 86
for 1 187 86
your 1 187 86
lives! 1 187 86

Fifthly, 1 187 87
a 1 187 87
U.S. 1 187 87
citizen 1 187 87
who 1 187 87
has 1 187 87
committed 1 187 87
NO 1 187 87
CRIME 1 187 87
is 1 187 87
denied 1 187 87
his 1 187 87
Natural 1 187 87
right 1 187 87
of 1 187 87
self-defense 1 187 87
for 1 187 87
a 1 187 87
whole 1 187 87
year. 1 187 87

And 1 187 88
the 1 187 88
media 1 187 88
report 1 187 88
says 1 187 88
the 1 187 88
confiscations 1 187 88
“only” 1 187 88
last 1 187 88
a 1 187 88
year, 1 187 88
with 1 187 88
the 1 187 88
caveat 1 187 88
that 1 187 88
they 1 187 88
may 1 187 88
be 1 187 88
extended. 1 187 88

Indeed. 1 187 89

They 1 187 90
could 1 187 90
and 1 187 90
very 1 187 90
likely 1 187 90
will 1 187 90
be 1 187 90
extended 1 187 90
indefinitely. 1 187 90

How 1 187 91
many 1 187 91
defenseless 1 187 91
(unarmed) 1 187 91
people 1 187 91
are 1 187 91
robbed, 1 187 91
assaulted, 1 187 91
accosted, 1 187 91
beaten 1 187 91
up, 1 187 91
raped, 1 187 91
wounded, 1 187 91
paralyzed, 1 187 91
or 1 187 91
killed 1 187 91
in 1 187 91
a 1 187 91
year’s 1 187 91
time? 1 187 91

It 0 187 92
seems 0 187 92
many 0 187 92
politicians 0 187 92
(and 0 187 92
many 0 187 92
police 0 187 92
officers 0 187 92
themselves) 0 187 92
will 0 187 92
not 0 187 92
be 0 187 92
content 0 187 92
until 0 187 92
every 0 187 92
American 0 187 92
citizen 0 187 92
is 0 187 92
totally 0 187 92
defenseless 0 187 92
and 0 187 92
unable 0 187 92
to 0 187 92
protect 0 187 92
him 0 187 92
or 0 187 92
herself. 0 187 92

I 0 187 93
tell 0 187 93
you 0 187 93
this 0 187 93
with 0 187 93
all 0 187 93
seriousness: 0 187 93
At 1 187 93
some 1 187 93
point, 1 187 93
the 1 187 93
American 1 187 93
people 1 187 93
will 1 187 93
be 1 187 93
forced 1 187 93
to 1 187 93
view 1 187 93
these 1 187 93
governmental 1 187 93
attacks 1 187 93
against 1 187 93
our 1 187 93
Second 1 187 93
Amendment 1 187 93
liberties 1 187 93
as 1 187 93
a 1 187 93
declaration 1 187 93
of 1 187 93
war. 1 187 93

Sixthly, 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
man 0 187 94
quoted 0 187 94
in 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
news 0 187 94
story 0 187 94
who 0 187 94
had 0 187 94
complained 0 187 94
about 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
armed 0 187 94
fellow 0 187 94
did 0 187 94
so 0 187 94
because 0 187 94
he 0 187 94
said 0 187 94
he 0 187 94
didn’t 0 187 94
like 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
sight 0 187 94
of 0 187 94
the 0 187 94
man 0 187 94
carrying 0 187 94
a 0 187 94
firearm, 0 187 94
as 0 187 94
it 0 187 94
made 0 187 94
him 0 187 94
“afraid.” 0 187 94

SO 1 187 95
WHAT? 1 187 95

That 0 187 96
the 0 187 96
mere 0 187 96
sight 0 187 96
of 0 187 96
a 0 187 96
law-abiding 0 187 96
citizen 0 187 96
openly 0 187 96
carrying 0 187 96
a 0 187 96
sidearm 0 187 96
would 0 187 96
make 0 187 96
someone 0 187 96
“afraid” 0 187 96
is 0 187 96
not 0 187 96
sufficient 0 187 96
reason 0 187 96
to 0 187 96
deny 0 187 96
the 0 187 96
citizen 0 187 96
his 0 187 96
constitutional 0 187 96
right 0 187 96
to 0 187 96
keep 0 187 96
and 0 187 96
“bear” 0 187 96
arms. 0 187 96

This 1 187 97
“I’m 1 187 97
offended” 1 187 97
or 1 187 97
“his 1 187 97
gun 1 187 97
scares 1 187 97
me” 1 187 97
complaint 1 187 97
is 1 187 97
nothing 1 187 97
but 1 187 97
cover 1 187 97
for 1 187 97
little 1 187 97
Nazis 1 187 97
to 1 187 97
try 1 187 97
and 1 187 97
deny 1 187 97
another 1 187 97
person 1 187 97
their 1 187 97
Natural, 1 187 97
God-given 1 187 97
liberty. 1 187 97

But 0 187 98
under 0 187 98
this 0 187 98
new 0 187 98
“red 0 187 98
flag” 0 187 98
law 0 187 98
in 0 187 98
Washington 0 187 98
State, 0 187 98
police 0 187 98
are 0 187 98
now 0 187 98
able 0 187 98
to 0 187 98
confiscate 0 187 98
a 0 187 98
person’s 0 187 98
firearm 0 187 98
without 0 187 98
the 0 187 98
person 0 187 98
committing 0 187 98
ANY 1 187 98
crime—or 0 187 98
even 0 187 98
threatening 0 187 98
to 0 187 98
commit 0 187 98
a 0 187 98
crime. 0 187 98

Even 0 187 99
when 0 187 99
police 0 187 99
forced 0 187 99
the 0 187 99
man 0 187 99
to 0 187 99
surrender 0 187 99
his 0 187 99
firearm, 0 187 99
the 0 187 99
man 0 187 99
made 0 187 99
no 0 187 99
threatening 0 187 99
gesture 0 187 99
toward 0 187 99
the 0 187 99
officers. 0 187 99

Gun 0 187 100
confiscation 0 187 100
has 0 187 100
started 0 187 100
in 0 187 100
America—and 0 187 100
President 1 187 100
Trump’s 1 187 100
Stalinist 1 187 100
statements 1 187 100
about 1 187 100
taking 1 187 100
guns 1 187 100
first 1 187 100
and 1 187 100
worrying 1 187 100
about 1 187 100
due 1 187 100
process 1 187 100
later 1 187 100
is 1 187 100
the 1 187 100
banner 1 187 100
under 1 187 100
which 1 187 100
this 1 187 100
is 1 187 100
happening. 1 187 100

When 0 187 101
Trump 0 187 101
promised 0 187 101
to 0 187 101
add 0 187 101
“mental 0 187 101
health” 0 187 101
regulations 0 187 101
to 0 187 101
gun 0 187 101
purchases 0 187 101
and 0 187 101
ownership, 0 187 101
he 1 187 101
opened 1 187 101
Pandora’s 1 187 101
Box. 1 187 101

I 0 187 102
go 0 187 102
into 0 187 102
the 0 187 102
“mental 0 187 102
health” 0 187 102
trap 0 187 102
in 0 187 102
more 0 187 102
detail 0 187 102
in 0 187 102
this 0 187 102
column: 0 187 102

Trump 0 187 103
Set 0 187 103
To 0 187 103

“Mental 0 187 104

regulations 0 187 104
for 0 187 104
gun 0 187 104
ownership 0 187 104
is 0 187 104
what 0 187 104
extremist 0 187 104
gun 0 187 104
grabbers 0 187 104
Schumer, 0 187 104
Pelosi, 0 187 104
Feinstein, 0 187 104
et 0 187 104
al., 0 187 104
have 0 187 104
been 0 187 104
trying 0 187 104
to 0 187 104
accomplish 0 187 104
for 0 187 104
decades. 0 187 104

Now, 0 187 105
it 0 187 105
is 0 187 105
the 0 187 105
“pro-gun” 0 187 105
Republican 0 187 105
President 0 187 105
Donald 0 187 105
Trump 0 187 105
who 0 187 105
is 0 187 105
the 0 187 105
one 0 187 105
making 0 187 105
it 0 187 105
happen. 0 187 105

Kris 0 187 106
Kobach 0 187 106
is 0 187 106
the 0 187 106

of 0 187 106

of 0 187 106
Kansas. 0 187 106

He 0 187 107
is 0 187 107
a 0 187 107
former 0 187 107

He 0 187 108
wrote 0 187 108
an 0 187 108
excellent 0 187 108
analysis 0 187 108
of 0 187 108
the 0 187 108
constitutional 0 187 108
violations 0 187 108
of 0 187 108
these 0 187 108
“red 0 187 108
flag” 0 187 108
laws: 0 187 108

The 0 187 109
seizure 0 187 109
of 0 187 109
guns 0 187 109
without 0 187 109
any 0 187 109
hearing 0 187 109
at 0 187 109
all. 0 187 109

The 0 187 110
laws 0 187 110
all 0 187 110
contain 0 187 110
an 0 187 110
“ex 0 187 110
parte” 0 187 110
provision 0 187 110
that 0 187 110
allows 0 187 110
the 0 187 110
state 0 187 110
to 0 187 110
temporarily 0 187 110
seize 0 187 110
a 0 187 110
person’s 0 187 110
guns 0 187 110
without 0 187 110
even 0 187 110
notifying 0 187 110
the 0 187 110

a 0 187 110
chance 0 187 110
to 0 187 110
be 0 187 110
heard. 0 187 110

This 0 187 111
is 0 187 111
the 0 187 111
quintessential 0 187 111
denial 0 187 111
of 0 187 111
due 0 187 111
process. 0 187 111

The 0 187 112
Fourth 0 187 112
Amendment 0 187 112
makes 0 187 112
clear 0 187 112
that 0 187 112
a 0 187 112
person 0 187 112
cannot 0 187 112
be 0 187 112
denied 0 187 112
of 0 187 112
liberty 0 187 112
(to 0 187 112
exercise 0 187 112

due 0 187 112
process 0 187 112
of 0 187 112
law. 0 187 112

This 0 187 113
confiscation 0 187 113
is 0 187 113
“temporary,” 0 187 113
but 0 187 113
it 0 187 113
can 0 187 113
easily 0 187 113
lead 0 187 113
to 0 187 113
long-term 0 187 113
or 0 187 113
permanent 0 187 113
confiscation. 0 187 113

Based 0 187 114
on 0 187 114
the 0 187 114
testimony 0 187 114
of 0 187 114
one 0 187 114
unrelated 0 187 114
person. 0 187 114

The 0 187 115
confiscation 0 187 115
order 0 187 115
can 0 187 115
be 0 187 115
based 0 187 115
on 0 187 115
the 0 187 115
testimony 0 187 115
of 0 187 115
only 0 187 115
one 0 187 115
person 0 187 115
claiming 0 187 115
that 0 187 115
the 0 187 115
gun 0 187 115
owner 0 187 115
poses 0 187 115
a 0 187 115
risk 0 187 115

of 0 187 115
himself 0 187 115
or 0 187 115
others. 0 187 115

The 0 187 116
law 0 187 116
deceptively 1 187 116
says 1 187 116
that 0 187 116
it 0 187 116
has 0 187 116
to 0 187 116
be 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
testimony 0 187 116
of 0 187 116
a 0 187 116
“family 0 187 116
member.” 0 187 116
[Most 0 187 116
of 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
“red 0 187 116
flag” 0 187 116
laws, 0 187 116
such 0 187 116
as 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
one 0 187 116
in 0 187 116
Washington 0 187 116
State, 0 187 116
do 0 187 116
not 0 187 116
limit 0 187 116
who 0 187 116
can 0 187 116
claim 0 187 116
the 0 187 116
gun 0 187 116
owner 0 187 116
poses 0 187 116
a 0 187 116
risk 0 187 116

others 0 187 116
to 0 187 116
family 0 187 116
members.] 0 187 116

But 0 187 117
“family 0 187 117
member” 0 187 117
is 0 187 117
defined 0 187 117
to 0 187 117
include 0 187 117
“former 0 187 117
dating 0 187 117
partners” 0 187 117
and 0 187 117
anyone 0 187 117
who 0 187 117

ever 0 187 117
lived 0 187 117
with 0 187 117
the 0 187 117
defendant. 0 187 117

So 0 187 118
a 0 187 118
jilted 0 187 118
former 0 187 118
boyfriend 0 187 118

a 0 187 118
roommate 0 187 118
from 0 187 118
years 0 187 118
ago, 0 187 118
could 0 187 118
easily 0 187 118
set 0 187 118
in 0 187 118
motion 0 187 118
the 0 187 118
disarming 0 187 118

a 0 187 118
lawful 0 187 118
gun 0 187 118
owner. 0 187 118

Using 0 187 119
a 0 187 119
very 0 187 119
low 0 187 119
standard 0 187 119
of 0 187 119
proof. 0 187 119

The 0 187 120
standard 0 187 120
for 0 187 120
obtaining 0 187 120
an 0 187 120
ex 0 187 120
parte 0 187 120
order 0 187 120
against 0 187 120
a 0 187 120
gun 0 187 120
owner 0 187 120
is 0 187 120
absurdly 1 187 120
low 1 187 120
– 0 187 120
one 0 187 120
need 0 187 120
only 0 187 120
show 0 187 120
“reasonable 0 187 120
cause” 0 187 120
to 0 187 120
believe 0 187 120
that 0 187 120
the 0 187 120
person 0 187 120
may 0 187 120
pose 0 187 120
a 0 187 120
risk. 0 187 120

That’s 0 187 121
even 0 187 121
lower 0 187 121
than 0 187 121
the 0 187 121
“probable 0 187 121
cause” 0 187 121
standard 0 187 121
for 0 187 121
obtaining 0 187 121
a 0 187 121
search 0 187 121
warrant. 0 187 121

In 0 187 122
addition, 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
judge 0 187 122
is 0 187 122
forced 0 187 122
to 0 187 122
rush 0 187 122
his 0 187 122
decision 0 187 122
and 0 187 122
issue 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
confiscation 0 187 122
order 0 187 122
on 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
same 0 187 122
day 0 187 122
of 0 187 122
the 0 187 122
ex 0 187 122
parte 0 187 122
hearing. 0 187 122

Within 0 187 123
two 0 187 123
weeks 0 187 123
of 0 187 123
the 0 187 123
ex 0 187 123
parte 0 187 123
hearing, 0 187 123
a 0 187 123
hearing 0 187 123
with 0 187 123
the 0 187 123
gun 0 187 123
owner 0 187 123
present 0 187 123
must 0 187 123
occur; 0 187 123
the 0 187 123
purpose 0 187 123
is 0 187 123
to 0 187 123
put 0 187 123
in 0 187 123
place 0 187 123
a 0 187 123
long-term 0 187 123
confiscation 0 187 123
order. 0 187 123

But 0 187 124
even 0 187 124
at 0 187 124
that 0 187 124
hearing, 0 187 124
the 0 187 124
standard 0 187 124
of 0 187 124
proof 0 187 124
is 0 187 124
far 0 187 124
below 0 187 124
the 0 187 124
“beyond 0 187 124
a 0 187 124
reasonable 0 187 124
doubt” 0 187 124
standard 0 187 124
used 0 187 124
in 0 187 124
criminal 0 187 124
trials. 0 187 124

Rather, 0 187 125
it 0 187 125
need 0 187 125
only 0 187 125
be 0 187 125
shown 0 187 125
by 0 187 125
“a 0 187 125
preponderance 0 187 125
of 0 187 125
evidence” 0 187 125
that 0 187 125
the 0 187 125
person 0 187 125
poses 0 187 125
a 0 187 125
risk 0 187 125
of 0 187 125
injury 0 187 125
to 0 187 125
self 0 187 125
or 0 187 125
others. 0 187 125

What 0 187 126
kind 0 187 126
of 0 187 126
evidence? 0 187 126

Things 0 187 127
like 0 187 127
the 0 187 127
“reckless 0 187 127
storage” 0 187 127
of 0 187 127
firearms 0 187 127
and 0 187 127
drinking 0 187 127
habits 0 187 127
can 0 187 127
be 0 187 127
considered. 0 187 127

If 1 187 128
you 1 187 128
keep 1 187 128
a 1 187 128
handgun 1 187 128
in 1 187 128
the 1 187 128
bedside 1 187 128
table 1 187 128
and 1 187 128
drink 1 187 128
beer 1 187 128
regularly, 1 187 128
you 1 187 128
may 1 187 128
[be] 1 187 128
in 1 187 128
trouble. 1 187 128

Shifting 0 187 129
the 0 187 129
burden 0 187 129
of 0 187 129
proof 0 187 129
to 0 187 129
the 0 187 129
gun 0 187 129
owner. 0 187 129

The 0 187 130
long-term 0 187 130
confiscation 0 187 130
order 0 187 130
lasts 0 187 130
up 0 187 130
to 0 187 130
a 0 187 130
year, 0 187 130
but 0 187 130
may 0 187 130
be 0 187 130
renewed 0 187 130
indefinitely. 0 187 130

Once 0 187 131
it 0 187 131
is 0 187 131
in 0 187 131
place, 0 187 131
it 0 187 131
becomes 0 187 131
very 0 187 131
difficult 0 187 131
to 0 187 131
remove. 0 187 131

To 0 187 132
have 0 187 132
the 0 187 132
confiscation 0 187 132
order 0 187 132
lifted, 0 187 132
the 0 187 132
gun 0 187 132
owner 0 187 132
must 0 187 132
provehe 0 187 132
does 0 187 132
not 0 187 132
pose 0 187 132
a 0 187 132
threat 0 187 132
to 0 187 132
himself 0 187 132
or 0 187 132
others. 0 187 132

Proving 1 187 133
a 1 187 133
negative 1 187 133
is 1 187 133
nearly 1 187 133
impossible. 1 187 133

Adding 1 187 134
insult 1 187 134
to 1 187 134
injury, 1 187 134
the 0 187 134
bill 0 187 134
even 0 187 134
authorizes 0 187 134
local 0 187 134
law 0 187 134
enforcement 0 187 134
to 0 187 134
charge 0 187 134
the 0 187 134
gun 0 187 134
owner 0 187 134
a 0 187 134
storage 0 187 134
fee 0 187 134
for 0 187 134
confiscating 0 187 134
and 0 187 134
storing 0 187 134
his 0 187 134
guns. 0 187 134

After 0 187 135
the 0 187 135
Parkland 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
shooting, 0 187 135
had 0 187 135
Donald 0 187 135
Trump 0 187 135
simply 0 187 135
used 0 187 135
his 0 187 135
bully 1 187 135
pulpit 1 187 135
to 0 187 135
promote 0 187 135
arming 0 187 135
teachers 0 187 135
and 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
employees 0 187 135
as 0 187 135
a 0 187 135
deterrent 0 187 135
and 0 187 135
defense 0 187 135
against 0 187 135
these 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
shootings 0 187 135
without 0 187 135
calling 0 187 135
for 0 187 135
more 0 187 135
gun 0 187 135
control, 0 187 135
it 0 187 135
would 0 187 135
have 0 187 135
been 0 187 135
a 0 187 135
HUGE 1 187 135
boost 0 187 135
for 0 187 135
the 0 187 135
Second 0 187 135
Amendment 0 187 135
in 0 187 135
general 0 187 135
and 0 187 135
school 0 187 135
safety 0 187 135
in 0 187 135
particular. 0 187 135

Instead, 0 187 136
Trump 0 187 136
fell 0 187 136
in 0 187 136
with 0 187 136
anti-Second 0 187 136
Amendment 0 187 136
liberals 0 187 136
and 0 187 136

for 0 187 136
more 0 187 136

restrictions 0 187 136
to 0 187 136

and 0 187 136
making 1 187 136
his 1 187 136
stupid 1 187 136
Stalinist 1 187 136
statements 1 187 136
about 1 187 136
taking 1 187 136

first 1 187 136
and 1 187 136
worrying 1 187 136
about 1 187 136
due 1 187 136
process 1 187 136
later. 1 187 136

As 0 187 137
a 0 187 137
result, 0 187 137
anti-gun 0 187 137
liberals 0 187 137
all 0 187 137
over 0 187 137
the 0 187 137

opened 1 187 145
the 1 187 145

One 0 187 147

that 0 187 147
self-defense—including 0 187 147

against 0 187 147
tyrannical 0 187 147
government—is 0 187 147
more 0 187 147
than 0 187 147
a 0 187 147

their 0 187 148
means 0 187 148
of 0 187 148
self-defense 0 187 148
is 0 187 148
not 0 187 148
only 0 187 148
a 0 187 148
crime 0 187 148
against 0 187 148
liberty; 0 187 148
it 0 187 148
is 0 187 148
a 0 187 148
sin 0 187 148
against 0 187 148
God. 0 187 148

I 0 187 149

my 0 187 149

that 0 187 152

a 0 187 152
plethora 0 187 152
of 0 187 152

who 0 187 152
teach 0 187 152
that 0 187 152

to 0 187 152

are 1 187 154

biblically, 1 187 154

it 0 187 157

a 0 26 2
series 1 26 2
of 1 26 2

that 0 26 2
correlate 0 26 2
with 0 26 2

out 0 26 2

this 0 26 2
up. 0 26 2

“I 0 26 3
definitely 0 26 3

that 0 26 3
there 0 26 3
was 0 26 3

The 0 26 4
man 0 26 4
then 0 26 4
goes 0 26 4
on 0 26 4
to 0 26 4
explain 0 26 4
that 0 26 4
after 0 26 4
being 0 26 4
shot 0 26 4
he 0 26 4
ran 0 26 4
“about 0 26 4
200 0 26 4
yards” 0 26 4
to 0 26 4
hide 0 26 4
behind 0 26 4
a 0 26 4
car, 0 26 4
all 0 26 4
the 0 26 4
while 0 26 4
hearing 0 26 4
bullets 0 26 4
fly 0 26 4
past 0 26 4
him 0 26 4
at 0 26 4
what 0 26 4
he 0 26 4
believes 0 26 4
was 0 26 4
ground 0 26 4
level. 0 26 4

“I’m 0 26 5
waiting 0 26 5
and 0 26 5
all 0 26 5
of 0 26 5
a 0 26 5
sudden 0 26 5
we 0 26 5
hear 0 26 5
a 0 26 5
little 0 26 5
whizzing 0 26 5
going 0 26 5
by 0 26 5
us, 0 26 5
all 0 26 5
of 0 26 5
a 0 26 5
sudden 0 26 5
bullets 0 26 5
are 0 26 5
just 0 26 5
flying 0 26 5
by,” 0 26 5
he 0 26 5
continued. 0 26 5

“When 0 26 6
something 0 26 6
is 0 26 6
coming 0 26 6
up 0 26 6
and 0 26 6
down 0 26 6
or 0 26 6
at 0 26 6
least 0 26 6
from 0 26 6
a 0 26 6
different 0 26 6
angle 0 26 6
they 0 26 6
are 0 26 6
either 0 26 6
going 0 26 6
to 0 26 6
hit 0 26 6
the 0 26 6
ground 0 26 6
or… 0 26 6
alot 0 26 6
of 0 26 6
different 0 26 6
things 0 26 6
are 0 26 6
going 0 26 6

When 0 26 7
someone 0 26 7
is 0 26 7
shooting 0 26 7
form 0 26 7
a 0 26 7
horizontal 0 26 7

its 0 26 7
just 0 26 7
going 0 26 7
to 0 26 7
keep 0 26 7
shooting,” 0 26 7
Palermo 0 26 7
attempted 0 26 7
to 0 26 7
explain. 0 26 7

Take 1 26 8
note 1 26 8
that 1 26 8
what 1 26 8
he 1 26 8
means 1 26 8
here 1 26 8
is 1 26 8
that 1 26 8
people 1 26 8
were 1 26 8
being 1 26 8
shot 1 26 8
at 1 26 8
from 1 26 8
ground 1 26 8
level 1 26 8
rather 1 26 8
than 1 26 8
the 1 26 8
32nd 1 26 8
floor 1 26 8
of 1 26 8
the 1 26 8
hotel. 1 26 8

Palermo 0 26 9
then 0 26 9
specifically 0 26 9
heard 0 26 9
the 0 26 9
gun 0 26 9
shots 0 26 9
get 0 26 9
“closer 0 26 9
and 0 26 9
closer” 0 26 9
before 0 26 9
quickly 0 26 9
deciding 0 26 9
it 0 26 9
was 0 26 9
once 0 26 9
again 0 26 9
time 0 26 9
to 0 26 9
run. 0 26 9

Shockingly, 0 26 10
he 0 26 10
then 0 26 10
goes 0 26 10
on 0 26 10
to 0 26 10
detail 0 26 10
the 0 26 10

that 0 26 10
at 0 26 10

had 0 26 10
exited 0 26 10
a 0 26 10

on 0 26 10
the 0 26 10

of 0 26 10
the 0 26 10
shooting 0 26 10
this 0 26 10
route 0 26 10
was 0 26 10
locked 0 26 10
down 0 26 10
shortly 0 26 10
before 0 26 10
the 0 26 10

“Every 0 26 11

at 0 26 11

“At 0 26 12

only 0 26 14

following 0 26 14

Palermo 0 26 15
makes 0 26 15
clear 0 26 15
this 0 26 15
confused 0 26 15
concert 0 26 15
goers 0 26 15
who 0 26 15
had 0 26 15
used 0 26 15
the 0 26 15
normal 0 26 15

“The 0 26 16

There 0 26 17
were 0 26 17

that 0 26 17
went 0 26 17
over 0 26 17
there 0 26 17

tried 0 26 17
to 0 26 17

there 0 26 17

them 0 26 17
no, 0 26 17
you 0 26 17
can’t 0 26 17

still 0 28 2
a 0 28 2
source 0 28 2
of 0 28 2
mystery. 0 28 2

So 0 28 3
who 0 28 3
is 0 28 3
Jesus 0 28 3
Campos? 0 28 3

That 0 28 4
burning 0 28 4
question 0 28 4
has 0 28 4
bothered 0 28 4
many 0 28 4
since 0 28 4
the 0 28 4
release 0 28 4
of 0 28 4
his 0 28 4
name, 0 28 4
but 0 28 4
there’s 0 28 4
been 0 28 4
no 0 28 4
photograph 0 28 4
of 0 28 4
this 0 28 4
alleged 0 28 4
hero, 0 28 4
even 0 28 4
though 0 28 4
we’ve 0 28 4
already 0 28 4
seen 0 28 4
crime 0 28 4
scene 0 28 4
images 0 28 4
of 0 28 4
the 0 28 4
guns 0 28 4
Stephen 0 28 4
Paddock 0 28 4
allegedly 0 28 4
dragged 0 28 4
up 0 28 4
to 0 28 4
his 0 28 4
32nd-floor 0 28 4
hotel 0 28 4
room. 0 28 4

The 0 28 5
ever-changing 0 28 5
narrative 0 28 5
now 0 28 5
though, 0 28 5
seems 0 28 5
to 0 28 5
swirl 0 28 5
around 0 28 5
this 0 28 5
unknown 0 28 5
mystery 0 28 5
security 0 28 5
guard. 0 28 5

At 0 28 6
first, 0 28 6
Campos, 0 28 6
a 0 28 6
guard 0 28 6
at 0 28 6
the 0 28 6
Mandalay 0 28 6
Bay 0 28 6
Resort 0 28 6
and 0 28 6
Casino, 0 28 6
was 0 28 6
hailed 0 28 6
a 0 28 6
hero 0 28 6
for 0 28 6
helping 0 28 6
guide 0 28 6
police 0 28 6
to 0 28 6
gunman 0 28 6
Stephen 0 28 6
Paddock’s 0 28 6
room 0 28 6
on 0 28 6
the 0 28 6
32nd 0 28 6
floor. 0 28 6

Police 0 28 7
said 0 28 7
Campos 0 28 7
was 0 28 7
shot 0 28 7
in 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
leg 0 28 7
at 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
end 0 28 7
of 0 28 7
Paddock’s 0 28 7
assault 0 28 7
on 0 28 7
concertgoers—potentially 0 28 7
distracting 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
gunman 0 28 7
and 0 28 7
causing 0 28 7
him 0 28 7
to 0 28 7
panic 0 28 7
and 0 28 7
kill 0 28 7
himself. 0 28 7

But 0 28 8
now, 0 28 8
questions 0 28 8
have 0 28 8
been 0 28 8
raised 0 28 8
after 0 28 8
Clark 0 28 8
County 0 28 8
Sheriff 0 28 8
Joe 0 28 8
Lombardo 0 28 8
revised 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
timeline 0 28 8
and 0 28 8
said 0 28 8
Campos 0 28 8
had 0 28 8
actually 0 28 8
been 0 28 8
shot 0 28 8
about 0 28 8
9:59 0 28 8
p.m. 0 28 8
a 0 28 8
(full 0 28 8
six 0 28 8
minutes 0 28 8
before 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
mass 0 28 8
shooting 0 28 8
began 0 28 8
at 0 28 8
10:05 0 28 8
p.m.) 0 28 8
which 0 28 8
means 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
guard 0 28 8
could 0 28 8
have 0 28 8
instead 0 28 8
led 0 28 8
Paddock 0 28 8
to 0 28 8
start 0 28 8
opening 0 28 8
fire 0 28 8
on 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
crowd 0 28 8
for 0 28 8
fear 0 28 8
of 0 28 8
being 0 28 8
caught. 0 28 8

Police 0 28 9
have 0 28 9
said 0 28 9
it 0 28 9
was 0 28 9
difficult 0 28 9
to 0 28 9
identify 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
source 0 28 9
of 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
bullets 0 28 9
during 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
attack, 0 28 9
and 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
confusion 0 28 9
added 0 28 9
more 0 28 9
minutes 0 28 9
to 0 28 9
their 0 28 9
lengthy 0 28 9
response. 0 28 9

But 0 28 10
the 0 28 10
revised 0 28 10
timeline 0 28 10
shows 0 28 10
officers 0 28 10
would 0 28 10
have 0 28 10
known 0 28 10
where 0 28 10
Paddock 0 28 10
was 0 28 10
before 0 28 10
the 0 28 10
mass 0 28 10
shooting 0 28 10
even 0 28 10
started. 0 28 10

Did 0 28 11
Campos 0 28 11
call 0 28 11
911? 0 28 11

What 0 28 12
happened 0 28 12
during 0 28 12
those 0 28 12
six 0 28 12
minutes? 0 28 12

Much 0 28 13
of 0 28 13
Campos’s 0 28 13
story 0 28 13
and 0 28 13
background 0 28 13
remains 0 28 13
a 0 28 13
mystery. 0 28 13

–Newsweek 0 28 14

Campos’s 0 28 15
co-worker 0 28 15
Liliana 0 28 15
Rodriguez 0 28 15
started 0 28 15
a 0 28 15

for 0 28 15
him 0 28 15
on 0 28 15
October 0 28 15
3, 0 28 15
explaining 0 28 15
that 0 28 15
he’d 0 28 15
been 0 28 15
shot 0 28 15
while 0 28 15
on 0 28 15
“random 0 28 15
patrol” 0 28 15
and 0 28 15
it 0 28 15
could 0 28 15
have 0 28 15
been 0 28 15
anyone 0 28 15
of 0 28 15
us. 0 28 15

“Funds 0 28 16

for 0 28 16
him 0 28 16

online 0 28 16

says. 0 28 16

“This 0 28 17
is 0 28 17

Strangely, 0 28 19
a 0 28 19
picture 0 28 19
of 0 28 19
Campos 0 28 19
wasn’t 0 28 19
displayed 0 28 19
as 0 28 19
part 0 28 19
of 0 28 19
the 0 28 19

because 0 28 19
Rodriguez 0 28 19
indicated 0 28 19
that 0 28 19
“due 0 28 19
to 0 28 19
privacy 0 28 19
from 0 28 19

we 0 28 19

There 1 28 20
are 1 28 20
obviously 1 28 20
certain 1 28 20
things 1 28 20
that 1 28 20
the 1 28 20
FBI 1 28 20
and 1 28 20

seem 1 28 20
intent 1 28 20
on 1 28 20
covering 1 28 20
up. 1 28 20

Their 0 28 21
own 0 28 21

quickly 0 28 21
shattering. 0 28 21

the 0 28 22

in 0 28 22
some 0 28 22
of 0 28 22
what 0 28 22
happened 0 28 22
ahead 0 28 22
of 0 28 22

it 0 28 22
only 0 28 22
added 0 28 22

in 0 28 22

McMahill 0 28 23
told 0 28 23
KNPR, 0 28 23
a 0 28 23
local 0 28 23
NPR 0 28 23
affiliate, 0 28 23
that 0 28 23
Campos 0 28 23
went 0 28 23
up 0 28 23
to 0 28 23
the 0 28 23
32nd 0 28 23
floor 0 28 23
to 0 28 23
investigate 0 28 23
a 0 28 23
door 0 28 23
alarm. 0 28 23

While 0 28 24
on 0 28 24
the 0 28 24
32nd 0 28 24
floor, 0 28 24
he 0 28 24
found 0 28 24
that 0 28 24
a 0 28 24
stairwell 0 28 24
door 0 28 24
was 0 28 24
jammed 0 28 24
and 0 28 24
radioed 0 28 24
down 0 28 24
to 0 28 24
maintenance. 0 28 24

Campos 0 28 25
heard 0 28 25
a 0 28 25
drilling 0 28 25
sound 0 28 25
and 0 28 25
thought 0 28 25
it 0 28 25
was 0 28 25
odd. 0 28 25

A 0 28 26
maintenance 0 28 26
worker 0 28 26
came 0 28 26
up 0 28 26
to 0 28 26
the 0 28 26
32nd 0 28 26
floor. 0 28 26

As 0 28 27
the 0 28 27
pair 0 28 27
started 0 28 27
talking, 0 28 27
Paddock 0 28 27
began 0 28 27
firing 0 28 27
through 0 28 27
the 0 28 27
door 0 28 27
of 0 28 27
his 0 28 27
room, 0 28 27
first 0 28 27
with 0 28 27
a 0 28 27
single-fire 0 28 27
gun 0 28 27
and 0 28 27
then 0 28 27
with 0 28 27
a 0 28 27
rapid-fire 0 28 27
rifle. 0 28 27

Police 0 28 28
have 0 28 28
said 0 28 28
that 0 28 28
when 0 28 28
Campos 0 28 28
radioed 0 28 28
what 0 28 28
happened, 0 28 28
it 0 28 28
helped 0 28 28
them 0 28 28
track 0 28 28
where 0 28 28
Paddock 0 28 28
was 0 28 28
holed 0 28 28
up 0 28 28
– 0 28 28
so 1 28 28
why 1 28 28
change 1 28 28
the 1 28 28
narrative 1 28 28
to 1 28 28
make 1 28 28
it 1 28 28
even 1 28 28
more 1 28 28
unbelievable? 1 28 28

And 0 28 29
still, 0 28 29
none 0 28 29
of 0 28 29
this 0 28 29
explains 0 28 29
why 0 28 29
Campos 0 28 29
is 0 28 29
not 0 28 29
registered 0 28 29
as 0 28 29
a 0 28 29
security 0 28 29
guard 0 28 29
either, 0 28 29
and 0 28 29
why 0 28 29
the 0 28 29
timeline 0 28 29
is 0 28 29
being 0 28 29
changed 0 28 29

What 1 28 30
exactly 1 28 30
do 1 28 30
they 1 28 30
want 1 28 30

An 0 33 1
outbreak 0 33 1
of 0 33 1
the 0 33 1
plague 0 33 1
in 0 33 1
Madagascar 0 33 1
is 0 33 1
spreading 0 33 1
at 0 33 1
an 0 33 1
unprecedented 1 33 1
rate. 0 33 1

With 0 33 2
the 0 33 2
ease 0 33 2
of 0 33 2
spreading 0 33 2
the 0 33 2
plague, 0 33 2
the 1 33 2
likelihood 1 33 2
that 1 33 2
this 1 33 2
disease 1 33 2
will 1 33 2
move 1 33 2
to 1 33 2
other 1 33 2
more 1 33 2
densely 1 33 2
populated 1 33 2
regions 1 33 2
of 1 33 2
the 1 33 2
planet 1 33 2
has 1 33 2
become 1 33 2
a 1 33 2
huge 1 33 2
concern 1 33 2
for 1 33 2
many. 1 33 2

So 0 33 3
far, 0 33 3
the 0 33 3
plague 0 33 3
has 0 33 3
claimed 0 33 3
57 0 33 3
lives 0 33 3
and 0 33 3
infected 0 33 3
more 0 33 3
than 0 33 3
680 0 33 3
others. 0 33 3

These 0 33 4
figures 0 33 4
are 0 33 4
from 0 33 4
October 0 33 4

however, 0 33 4
and 0 33 4
the 0 33 4
disease 0 33 4
is 0 33 4
spreading 0 33 4
rapidly. 0 33 4

An 0 33 5
estimated 0 33 5
329 0 33 5
of 0 33 5
these 0 33 5
cases 0 33 5
and 0 33 5
25 0 33 5
of 0 33 5
the 0 33 5

A 0 33 7
further 0 33 7

were 0 33 7
unspecified, 0 33 7
according 0 33 7
to 0 33 7
the 0 33 7
World 0 33 7
Health 0 33 7
Organization. 0 33 7

Of 0 33 8
Madagascar’s 0 33 8
114 0 33 8
districts, 0 33 8
35 0 33 8
have 0 33 8
reported 0 33 8
cases 0 33 8
of 0 33 8
plague, 0 33 8
including 0 33 8
at 0 33 8
least 0 33 8
10 0 33 8
cities. 0 33 8

Plague 0 33 9
is 0 33 9
caused 0 33 9
by 0 33 9
infection 0 33 9
with 0 33 9
the 0 33 9
bacterium 0 33 9
Yersinia 0 33 9
pestis 0 33 9
and 0 33 9
is 0 33 9
typically 0 33 9
spread 0 33 9
through 0 33 9
the 0 33 9
bite 0 33 9
of 0 33 9
infected 0 33 9
fleas, 0 33 9
frequently 0 33 9
carried 0 33 9
by 0 33 9
rats. 0 33 9

The 0 33 10
bacteria 0 33 10
will 0 33 10
eventually 0 33 10
end 0 33 10
up 0 33 10
causing 0 33 10
the 0 33 10
often 0 33 10
fatal 0 33 10
plague. 0 33 10

Symptoms 0 33 11
can 0 33 11
include 0 33 11
painful, 0 33 11
swollen 0 33 11
lymph 0 33 11
nodes, 0 33 11
called 0 33 11
buboes, 0 33 11
as 0 33 11
well 0 33 11
as 0 33 11
fever, 0 33 11
chills, 0 33 11
and 0 33 11
coughing. 0 33 11

Pneumonic 0 33 12
plague 0 33 12
is 0 33 12
more 0 33 12
virulent 0 33 12
or 0 33 12
damaging 0 33 12
and 0 33 12
is 0 33 12
an 0 33 12
advanced 0 33 12
form 0 33 12
of 0 33 12
the 0 33 12
disease 0 33 12
characterized 0 33 12
by 0 33 12
a 0 33 12
severe 0 33 12
lung 0 33 12
infection. 0 33 12

The 0 33 13
infection 0 33 13
can 0 33 13
be 0 33 13
transmitted 0 33 13
from 0 33 13
person 0 33 13
to 0 33 13
person 0 33 13
via 0 33 13
airborne 0 33 13
droplets 0 33 13
from 0 33 13
coughing 0 33 13
or 0 33 13
sneezing. 0 33 13

The 0 33 14
incubation 0 33 14
period 0 33 14
is 0 33 14
extremely 1 33 14
short 0 33 14
too, 0 33 14
and 0 33 14
an 0 33 14
infected 0 33 14
person 0 33 14
may 0 33 14
die 0 33 14
within 0 33 14
12 0 33 14
to 0 33 14
24 0 33 14

According 0 33 15
to 0 33 15
CNN, 0 33 15
the 0 33 15
cases 0 33 15
were 0 33 15
reported 0 33 15
by 0 33 15

They 0 33 16
include 0 33 16
probable 0 33 16
and 0 33 16
suspected 0 33 16
cases 0 33 16
as 0 33 16
well 0 33 16
those 0 33 16
that 0 33 16
have 0 33 16
been 0 33 16
confirmed 0 33 16
by 0 33 16
laboratory 0 33 16
tests. 0 33 16

And 0 33 17
while 0 33 17
the 0 33 17
country 0 33 17
experiences 0 33 17
regular 0 33 17
outbreaks, 0 33 17
with 0 33 17
an 0 33 17
estimated 0 33 17
400 0 33 17
cases 0 33 17
of 0 33 17
plague 0 33 17
each 0 33 17
year, 0 33 17
this 0 33 17
time 0 33 17
things 0 33 17
are 0 33 17
very 0 33 17
different, 0 33 17
experts 0 33 17
warn. 0 33 17

This 0 33 18
year, 0 33 18
health 0 33 18
officials 0 33 18
report 0 33 18
the 0 33 18
infections 0 33 18
started 0 33 18
much 0 33 18
earlier 0 33 18
than 0 33 18
usual, 0 33 18
and 0 33 18
they’re 0 33 18
occurring 0 33 18
in 0 33 18
new 0 33 18
areas, 0 33 18
including 0 33 18
urban 0 33 18
settings. 0 33 18

They’ve 0 33 19
also 0 33 19
seen 0 33 19
an 0 33 19
unexpected 0 33 19
number 0 33 19
of 0 33 19
cases 0 33 19
of 0 33 19
pneumonic 0 33 19
plague, 0 33 19
which 0 33 19
transmits 0 33 19
more 0 33 19
easily 0 33 19
from 0 33 19
person 0 33 19
to 0 33 19
person. 0 33 19

Historically 0 33 20
dubbed 0 33 20
the 0 33 20
“black 1 33 20
death” 1 33 20
the 0 33 20
bubonic 0 33 20
plague 0 33 20
has 0 33 20
been 0 33 20
responsible 0 33 20
for 0 33 20
several 0 33 20
worldwide 0 33 20
pandemics 0 33 20
in 0 33 20
the 0 33 20
past. 0 33 20

Early 0 33 21
detection 0 33 21
of 0 33 21
the 0 33 21
plague 0 33 21
is 0 33 21
key 0 33 21
since 0 33 21
both 0 33 21
forms 0 33 21
of 0 33 21
it 0 33 21
can 0 33 21
be 0 33 21
cured 0 33 21
with 0 33 21
antibiotics. 0 33 21

But, 0 33 22
occasionally 0 33 22
there 0 33 22
can 0 33 22
be 0 33 22
cases 0 33 22
of 0 33 22
septicemic 0 33 22
plague, 0 33 22
where 0 33 22
the 0 33 22
infection 0 33 22
has 0 33 22
spread 0 33 22
to 0 33 22
a 0 33 22
person’s 0 33 22
bloodstream 0 33 22
and 0 33 22
can 0 33 22
cause 0 33 22
bleeding 0 33 22
and 0 33 22
necrosis 0 33 22
of 0 33 22
tissue, 0 33 22
turning 0 33 22
it 0 33 22
black. 0 33 22

Internationally, 0 33 23
this 0 33 23
outbreak 0 33 23
is 0 33 23
also 0 33 23
being 0 33 23
taken 0 33 23
seriously. 0 33 23

around 0 36 3
a 0 36 3

that 0 36 3
the 0 36 3
FBI 0 36 3

our 0 39 11
15-year 0 39 11
war 0 39 11
in 0 39 11
Iraq 0 39 11

With 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
grim 0 39 12
prospect 0 39 12
in 0 39 12
mind, 0 39 12
Secretary 0 39 12
Rex 0 39 12
Tillerson 0 39 12
said 0 39 12
Sunday 0 39 12
, 0 39 12
"Iranian 0 39 12

Any 0 39 13

need 0 39 13

Tillerson 0 39 14
meant 0 39 14
Iran's 0 39 14
Quds 0 39 14
Force 0 39 14
in 0 39 14
Iraq 0 39 14
should 0 39 14
go 0 39 14
home, 0 39 14
and 0 39 14
the 0 39 14
Shiite 0 39 14
militia 0 39 14
in 0 39 14
Iraq 0 39 14
should 0 39 14
be 0 39 14
conscripted 0 39 14
into 0 39 14
the 0 39 14
army. 0 39 14

But 1 39 15
what 1 39 15
if 1 39 15
the 1 39 15
Baghdad 1 39 15
regime 1 39 15
of 1 39 15
Haider 1 39 15
al-Abadi 1 39 15
does 1 39 15
not 1 39 15
agree? 1 39 15

What 1 39 16
if 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Quds 1 39 16
Force 1 39 16
does 1 39 16
not 1 39 16
go 1 39 16
home 1 39 16
to 1 39 16
Iran 1 39 16
and 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Shiite 1 39 16
militias 1 39 16
that 1 39 16

Iraqi 1 39 16
army? 1 39 16

Who 0 39 17
then 0 39 17
enforces 0 39 17
Tillerson's 0 39 17
demands? 0 39 17

Consider 0 39 18
what 0 39 18
is 0 39 18
happening 0 39 18
in 0 39 18
Syria. 0 39 18

The 0 39 19
U.S.-backed 0 39 19
Syrian 0 39 19
Democratic 0 39 19
Forces, 0 39 19
largely 0 39 19

just 0 39 19
annihilated 0 39 19
ISIS 0 39 19
in 0 39 19
Raqqa 0 39 19

drove 0 39 19

oil 0 39 19
field, 0 39 19
al-Omar, 0 39 19
from 0 39 19
ISIS. 0 39 19

The 0 39 20
race 0 39 20
is 0 39 20
now 0 39 20
on 0 39 20
between 0 39 20
the 0 39 20
SDF 0 39 20
and 0 39 20
Bashar 0 39 20
Assad's 0 39 20

to 0 39 20
secure 0 39 20
the 0 39 20
border 0 39 20
with 0 39 20
Iraq. 0 39 20

Bottom 0 39 21
line: 0 39 21
The 0 39 21
U.S. 0 39 21
goal 0 39 21
of 0 39 21
crushing 0 39 21
the 0 39 21
ISIS 0 39 21
caliphate 0 39 21
is 0 39 21
almost 0 39 21
attained. 0 39 21

But 0 39 22
if 0 39 22
our 0 39 22
victory 0 39 22
in 0 39 22
the 0 39 22

secure, 1 39 22
is 1 39 22
that 1 39 22
really 1 39 22
a 1 39 22
victory? 1 39 22

Do 1 39 23
we 1 39 23
accept 1 39 23
that 1 39 23
outcome, 1 39 23
pack 1 39 23
up 1 39 23
and 1 39 23
go 1 39 23
home? 1 39 23

Or 1 39 24
do 1 39 24
we 1 39 24
leave 1 39 24
our 1 39 24
forces 1 39 24
in 1 39 24
Syria 1 39 24

Iraq 1 39 24

defy 1 39 24
any 1 39 24

from 1 39 24

"The 0 39 25
Next 0 39 25

Wars," 0 39 25
raises 0 39 25
the 0 39 25
crucial 0 39 25
questions 0 39 25
now 0 39 25
before 0 39 25
us. 0 39 25

Would 0 39 26
President 0 39 26
Trump 0 39 26
be 0 39 26
willing 0 39 26
to 0 39 26
fight 0 39 26
a 0 39 26
new 0 39 26
war 0 39 26
to 0 39 26
keep 0 39 26
Iran 0 39 26
from 0 39 26
consolidating 0 39 26
its 0 39 26
position 0 39 26
in 0 39 26
Iraq 0 39 26
and 0 39 26
Syria? 0 39 26

Would 1 39 27
the 1 39 27
American 1 39 27
people 1 39 27
support 1 39 27
such 1 39 27
a 1 39 27
war 1 39 27
with 1 39 27
U.S. 1 39 27
troops? 1 39 27

Would 0 39 28
Congress, 0 39 28
apparently 1 39 28
clueless 1 39 28
to 1 39 28
the 1 39 28
presence 1 39 28
of 1 39 28
800 1 39 28
U.S. 1 39 28
troops 1 39 28
in 1 39 28
Niger, 1 39 28
authorize 0 39 28
a 0 39 28
new 0 39 28
U.S. 0 39 28
war 0 39 28
in 0 39 28
Syria 0 39 28
or 0 39 28
Iraq? 0 39 28

If 0 39 29
Trump 0 39 29
and 0 39 29
his 0 39 29
generals 0 39 29
felt 0 39 29
our 0 39 29
vital 0 39 29
interests 0 39 29
could 0 39 29
not 0 39 29
allow 0 39 29
Syria 0 39 29
and 0 39 29
Iraq 0 39 29
to 0 39 29
drift 0 39 29
into 0 39 29
the 0 39 29
orbit 0 39 29
of 0 39 29
Iran, 0 39 29
where 0 39 29
would 0 39 29
we 0 39 29
find 0 39 29
allies 0 39 29
for 0 39 29
such 0 39 29
a 0 39 29
fight? 0 39 29

If 1 39 30
we 1 39 30
rely 1 39 30
on 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
Kurds 1 39 30
in 1 39 30
Syria, 1 39 30
we 1 39 30
lose 1 39 30
NATO 1 39 30
ally 1 39 30
Turkey, 1 39 30
which 1 39 30
regards 1 39 30
Syria's 1 39 30
Kurds 1 39 30
as 1 39 30
collaborators 1 39 30
of 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
PKK 1 39 30
in 1 39 30
Turkey, 1 39 30
which 1 39 30
even 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
U.S. 1 39 30
designates 1 39 30
a 1 39 30
terrorist 1 39 30
organization. 1 39 30

The 0 39 31
decision 0 39 31
as 0 39 31
to 0 39 31
whether 0 39 31
this 0 39 31
country 0 39 31
should 0 39 31
engage 0 39 31
in 0 39 31
new 0 39 31
post-ISIS 0 39 31
wars 0 39 31
in 0 39 31
the 0 39 31
Mideast, 0 39 31
however, 0 39 31
may 0 39 31
be 0 39 31
taken 0 39 31
out 0 39 31
of 0 39 31
our 0 39 31
hands. 0 39 31

Saturday, 0 39 32
Israel 0 39 32
launched 0 39 32
new 0 39 32
air 0 39 32
strikes 0 39 32
against 0 39 32
gun 0 39 32
positions 0 39 32
in 0 39 32
Syria 0 39 32
in 0 39 32
retaliation 0 39 32
for 0 39 32
shells 0 39 32
fired 0 39 32
into 0 39 32
the 0 39 32
Golan 0 39 32
Heights. 0 39 32

Damascus 0 39 33
claims 0 39 33
that 0 39 33
Israel's 0 39 33
"terrorist" 1 39 33
allies 0 39 33
inside 0 39 33
Syria 0 39 33
fired 0 39 33
the 0 39 33
shells, 0 39 33
to 0 39 33
give 0 39 33
the 0 39 33
IDF 0 39 33
an 0 39 33
excuse 0 39 33
to 0 39 33
attack. 0 39 33

Why 0 39 34
would 0 39 34
Israel 0 39 34
wish 0 39 34
to 0 39 34
provoke 0 39 34
a 0 39 34
war 0 39 34
with 0 39 34
Syria? 0 39 34

Because 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
Israelis 0 39 35
see 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
outcome 0 39 35
of 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
six-year 0 39 35
Syrian 0 39 35
civil 0 39 35
war 0 39 35
as 0 39 35
a 0 39 35
strategic 0 39 35
disaster. 0 39 35

Hezbollah, 0 39 36
stronger 0 39 36
than 0 39 36
ever, 0 39 36
was 0 39 36
part 0 39 36
of 0 39 36
Assad's 0 39 36
victorious 0 39 36
coalition. 0 39 36

Iran 0 39 37
may 0 39 37
have 0 39 37
secured 0 39 37
its 0 39 37
land 0 39 37
corridor 0 39 37
from 0 39 37
Tehran 0 39 37
to 0 39 37
Beirut. 0 39 37

Its 0 39 38
presence 0 39 38
in 0 39 38
Syria 0 39 38
could 0 39 38
now 0 39 38
be 0 39 38
permanent. 0 39 38

And 1 39 39
only 1 39 39
one 1 39 39
force 1 39 39
in 1 39 39
the 1 39 39
region 1 39 39
has 1 39 39
the 1 39 39
power 1 39 39
to 1 39 39
reverse 1 39 39
the 1 39 39
present 1 39 39
outcome 1 39 39
of 1 39 39
Syria's 1 39 39
civil 1 39 39
war--the 1 39 39
United 1 39 39
States. 1 39 39

Bibi 0 39 40
Netanyahu 0 39 40
knows 0 39 40
that 0 39 40
if 0 39 40
war 0 39 40
with 0 39 40
Syria 0 39 40
breaks 0 39 40
out, 0 39 40
a 0 39 40
clamor 0 39 40
will 0 39 40
arise 0 39 40
in 0 39 40
Congress 0 39 40
to 0 39 40
have 0 39 40
the 0 39 40
U.S. 0 39 40
rush 0 39 40
to 0 39 40
Israel's 0 39 40
aid. 0 39 40

"A 0 39 41
failure 1 39 41

for 1 39 41

ultimately, 1 39 41
the 1 39 41

the 1 43 4
crisis 1 43 4
in 1 43 4

the 1 43 5

Since 0 43 6

out 0 43 6
of 0 43 6

this 0 43 6
outbreak 0 43 6
has 0 43 6
so 0 43 6
far, 0 43 6
been 0 43 6
impossible 0 43 6

said: 0 43 7
“With 0 43 7
anything 0 43 7
like 0 43 7
this 0 43 7
there 0 43 7
is 0 43 7
a 0 43 7
possibility 0 43 7
that 0 43 7

and 0 43 7
get 0 43 7

We 0 43 8
have 0 43 8
done 0 43 8

the 0 43 8

under 0 43 8
control 0 43 8
to 0 43 8
prevent 0 43 8
its 0 43 8
spread. 0 43 8

The 0 43 9
outbreak 0 43 9
is 0 43 9
considered 0 43 9
a 0 43 9
much 0 43 9
bigger 0 43 9
threat 0 43 9
to 0 43 9
the 0 43 9
region 0 43 9
than 0 43 9
in 0 43 9
previous 0 43 9
years 0 43 9
because 0 43 9
it 0 43 9
has 0 43 9
taken 0 43 9

its 0 43 9
pneumonic 0 43 9
form. 0 43 9

That 0 43 10
means 0 43 10
it 0 43 10
is 0 43 10
airborne 0 43 10

spread 0 43 10
by 0 43 10

Not 0 43 11
only 0 43 11
that, 0 43 11
but 0 43 11
the 0 43 11
plague 0 43 11
has 0 43 11
a 0 43 11
very 0 43 11
short 0 43 11

Once 0 43 12
exposed, 0 43 12
some 0 43 12

will 0 43 12
die 0 43 12
within 0 43 12
24 0 43 12
hours. 0 43 12

Experts 0 43 13
say 0 43 13
the 1 43 13
epidemic 1 43 13
could 1 43 13
still 1 43 13

“If 0 43 15
they 0 43 15

“We 0 43 16
don’t 0 43 16

you 0 43 17
look 0 43 17
at 0 43 17
this 0 43 17

70 0 43 17
percent 0 43 17

the 0 43 17
cases 0 43 17
are 0 43 17
pneumonic 0 43 17

which 0 43 17
is 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
most 0 43 17
deadly 0 43 17
form 0 43 17
of 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
disease. 0 43 17

If 1 43 18
the 1 43 18
treatment 1 43 18
is 1 43 18
not 1 43 18

Both 0 43 18

typically 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
mere 0 62 7

the 0 62 11

two 0 62 11
students 0 62 11
on 0 62 11
the 0 62 11

getting 0 62 11
the 0 62 11

passed, 0 62 11
which 0 62 11
Democratize 0 62 11

claimed 0 62 11
were 0 62 11
“conflicts 0 62 11
of 0 62 11
interests.” 0 62 11

Somehow 0 62 12
I 0 62 12
don't 0 62 12
think 0 62 12
being 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
member 0 62 12
of 0 62 12
a 0 62 12

would 0 62 12
be 0 62 12
considered 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
conflict 0 62 12
of 0 62 12

But 0 62 13
the 1 62 13
campus 1 62 13
anti-Israel 1 62 13
crowd 1 62 13
has 0 62 13
been 0 62 13
working 0 62 13
rather 0 62 13
hard 0 62 13
to 0 62 13

penalize 0 62 13
anyone 0 62 13
involved 0 62 13
in 0 62 13
pro-Israel 0 62 13
organizations. 0 62 13

And 0 62 14
to 0 62 14
keep 0 62 14
their 0 62 14

the 0 62 15

three 0 62 21
students 0 62 21
were 0 62 21

All 0 62 22
three 0 62 22
were 0 62 22
targeted 0 62 22
for 0 62 22
removal 0 62 22
either 0 62 22
because 0 62 22
they 0 62 22
are 0 62 22
Jewish 0 62 22
or 0 62 22
have 0 62 22
vocally 0 62 22
opposed 0 62 22
anti-Jewish 0 62 22
discrimination 0 62 22
on 0 62 22
campus. 0 62 22

This 0 62 23
episode 0 62 23
is 0 62 23
utterly 1 62 23
unacceptable, 1 62 23
and 0 62 23
is 0 62 23
merely 0 62 23
the 0 62 23
latest 0 62 23
in 0 62 23
a 0 62 23
long 0 62 23
string 0 62 23
of 0 62 23
antisemitic 0 62 23
incidents 0 62 23
at 0 62 23
your 0 62 23
university. 0 62 23

Indeed, 0 62 24
according 0 62 24
to 0 62 24
eyewitnesses, 0 62 24
one 0 62 24
of 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
members 0 62 24
of 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
mob 0 62 24
that 0 62 24
removed 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
three 0 62 24
directors 0 62 24
was 0 62 24
Igor 0 62 24
Sadikov. 0 62 24

You 0 62 25
will 0 62 25
remember 0 62 25
Sadikov 0 62 25
as 0 62 25
the 0 62 25
student 0 62 25
politician 0 62 25
who 0 62 25
in 0 62 25
February 0 62 25
told 0 62 25
his 0 62 25
followers 0 62 25
to 0 62 25
“punch 1 62 25
a 1 62 25
Zionist 1 62 25
today.” 1 62 25
It 0 62 25
is 0 62 25
unclear 0 62 25
whether 0 62 25
Sadikov 0 62 25
has 0 62 25
faced 0 62 25
any 0 62 25
disciplinary 0 62 25
action 0 62 25
for 0 62 25
this 0 62 25
incitement 0 62 25
to 0 62 25
violence 0 62 25
from 0 62 25
your 0 62 25
administration. 0 62 25

Antisemitism 0 62 26
at 0 62 26
McGill 0 62 26
does 0 62 26
not 0 62 26
emerge 0 62 26
from 0 62 26
a 0 62 26
vacuum. 0 62 26

Rather, 0 62 27
it 0 62 27
has 0 62 27
been 0 62 27
nurtured 0 62 27
in 0 62 27
part 0 62 27
by 0 62 27
a 1 62 27
toxic 1 62 27
campus 1 62 27
press, 1 62 27
especially 0 62 27
the 0 62 27
McGill 0 62 27
Daily, 0 62 27
a 0 62 27
publication 0 62 27
which 0 62 27
openly 0 62 27
refuses 0 62 27
to 0 62 27
publish 0 62 27
any 0 62 27
“Zionist” 0 62 27
content. 0 62 27

In 0 62 28
practice, 0 62 28
this 0 62 28
prevents 0 62 28
McGill’s 0 62 28
Jewish 0 62 28
community 0 62 28
from 0 62 28
defending 0 62 28
itself 0 62 28
against 0 62 28
the 1 62 28
absurd 1 62 28
attacks 1 62 28
to 0 62 28
which 0 62 28
it 0 62 28
is 0 62 28
subjected. 0 62 28

If 0 62 29
the 0 62 29
Daily 0 62 29
is 0 62 29
committed 0 62 29
to 0 62 29
systematically 0 62 29
excluding 0 62 29
the 0 62 29
voices 0 62 29
of 0 62 29
an 0 62 29
ethno-religious 0 62 29
community 0 62 29
on 0 62 29
campus, 0 62 29
then 0 62 29
it 0 62 29
cannot 0 62 29
continue 0 62 29
to 0 62 29
receive 0 62 29
automatic 0 62 29
student 0 62 29
funding, 0 62 29
as 0 62 29
it 0 62 29
does 0 62 29
now. 0 62 29

The 0 62 30
double 0 62 30
standard 0 62 30
here 0 62 30
is 0 62 30
pretty 0 62 30
clear. 0 62 30

And 0 62 30

we 0 62 30

know 1 62 30

exactly 1 62 30

what 1 62 30

the 1 62 30

reaction 1 62 30

would 1 62 30

be 1 62 30

if 1 62 30

a 1 62 30

student 1 62 30

“Art 1 45 7

all 0 45 7
week 0 45 7

The 0 45 13
fact 0 45 13
is 0 45 13
that 0 45 13
the 0 45 13
CIA 0 45 13
put 0 45 13
in 0 45 13
its 0 45 13
request 0 45 13
to 0 45 13

But 0 45 14
“Art 1 45 14
of 1 45 14
the 1 45 14

Trump 1 45 14
obviously 1 45 14
sat 1 45 14
on 1 45 14
the 1 45 14
request, 1 45 14
undoubtedly 1 45 14
hoping 1 45 14
that 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
could 1 45 14
get 1 45 14
what 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
wanted 1 45 14
in 1 45 14
return 1 45 14
if 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
just 1 45 14
continued 1 45 14
holding 1 45 14
out 1 45 14
and 1 45 14
conveying 1 45 14
that 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
was 1 45 14
ready 1 45 14
to 1 45 14
release 1 45 14
the 1 45 14

Don’t 0 45 15
forget: 0 45 15
According 0 45 15
to 0 45 15
Trump’s 0 45 15
own 0 45 15

he 0 45 15
had 0 45 15
already 0 45 15
ostensibly 0 45 15
decided 0 45 15
to 0 45 15

Now, 0 45 18
it’s 0 45 18
theoretically 0 45 18
possible 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
the 0 45 18

long-secret 1 45 18
JFK 0 45 18
records. 0 45 18

But 1 45 19
how 1 45 19
likely 1 45 19
is 1 45 19
that? 1 45 19

Not 0 45 20
likely 0 45 20
at 0 45 20
all! 0 45 20

Instead, 0 45 21
it 1 45 21
is 1 45 21
a 1 45 21
virtual 1 45 21
certainly 1 45 21
that 1 45 21
when 1 45 21
Art 1 45 21
of 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
Deal 1 45 21
Trump 1 45 21
sent 1 45 21
out 1 45 21
those 1 45 21
two 1 45 21
tweets, 1 45 21
he 1 45 21
was 1 45 21
sending 1 45 21
a 1 45 21
message 1 45 21
to 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
CIA 1 45 21
as 1 45 21
part 1 45 21
of 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
negotiations: 1 45 21
Give 1 45 21
me 1 45 21
what 1 45 21
I 1 45 21
want 1 45 21
or 1 45 21
I 1 45 21
will 1 45 21
release 1 45 21
the 1 45 21
records. 1 45 21

In 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
negotiations, 0 45 22
both 0 45 22
Trump 0 45 22
and 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
CIA 0 45 22
knew 0 45 22
that 0 45 22
Trump 0 45 22
was 0 45 22
in 0 45 22
the 0 45 22
catbird 0 45 22
seat. 0 45 22

In 0 45 24
the 0 45 24
end, 0 45 24
the 0 45 24
CIA 0 45 24
blinked, 0 45 24
just 0 45 24
as 0 45 24
Trump 0 45 24
knew 0 45 24
it 0 45 24
would. 0 45 24

Contrary 0 45 25
to 0 45 25
what 0 45 25
the 0 45 25
mainstream 0 45 25
press 0 45 25
is 0 45 25
asserting, 0 45 25
the 1 45 25
records 1 45 25
undoubtedly 1 45 25
contain 1 45 25
more 1 45 25
incriminating 1 45 25
circumstantial 1 45 25
evidence 1 45 25
that 1 45 25
fills 1 45 25
in 1 45 25
the 1 45 25
mosaic 1 45 25
of 1 45 25
a 1 45 25
U.S. 1 45 25
national-security 1 45 25
regime-change 1 45 25
operation 1 45 25
on 1 45 25
November 1 45 25
22, 1 45 25
1963. 1 45 25

That’s 0 45 26
what 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
mainstream 0 45 26
media, 0 45 26
forever 0 45 26
wedded 0 45 26
to 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
official 0 45 26
story 0 45 26
no 0 45 26
matter 0 45 26
how 0 45 26
ridiculous 1 45 26
and 1 45 26
illogical 1 45 26
it 0 45 26
is, 0 45 26
simply 0 45 26
cannot 0 45 26
bring 0 45 26
themselves 0 45 26
to 0 45 26
confront. 0 45 26

Trump 0 45 27
knew 0 45 27
that 0 45 27
he 0 45 27
had 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
CIA 0 45 27
over 0 45 27
a 0 45 27
barrel. 0 45 27

As 0 45 28
I 0 45 28
indicated 0 45 28
in 0 45 28
my 0 45 28
two 0 45 28
articles 0 45 28
this 0 45 28
week, 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
CIA 0 45 28
was 0 45 28
between 0 45 28
a 0 45 28
rock 0 45 28
and 0 45 28
a 0 45 28
hard 0 45 28
place. 0 45 28

On 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
one 0 45 29
hand, 0 45 29
it 0 45 29
could 0 45 29
refuse 0 45 29
to 0 45 29
grant 0 45 29
Trump 0 45 29
what 0 45 29
he 0 45 29
wanted 0 45 29
and 0 45 29
let 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
records 0 45 29
be 0 45 29
released, 0 45 29
which 0 45 29
it 1 45 29
knew 1 45 29
would 1 45 29
point 1 45 29
to 1 45 29
the 1 45 29
CIA’s 1 45 29
guilt 1 45 29
in 1 45 29
the 1 45 29
assassination. 1 45 29

On 0 45 30
the 0 45 30
other 0 45 30
hand, 0 45 30
it 0 45 30
could 0 45 30
give 0 45 30
Trump 0 45 30
what 0 45 30
he 0 45 30
wanted 0 45 30
and 0 45 30
have 0 45 30
to 0 45 30
suffer 0 45 30
the 1 45 30
obvious 1 45 30
inference 1 45 30
that 1 45 30
people 1 45 30
would 1 45 30
draw 1 45 30
— 1 45 30
that 1 45 30
the 1 45 30
CIA 1 45 30
was 1 45 30
continuing 1 45 30
to 1 45 30
cover 1 45 30
up 1 45 30
incriminatory 1 45 30
evidence. 1 45 30

What 0 45 31
did 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
CIA 0 45 31
give 0 45 31
Trump 0 45 31
in 0 45 31
return 0 45 31
for 0 45 31
Trump’s 0 45 31
extending 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
CIA’s 0 45 31
50-year-plus 0 45 31
secrecy? 0 45 31

We 0 45 32
don’t 0 45 32
know, 0 45 32
but 0 45 32
my 0 45 32
hunch 0 45 32
is 0 45 32
that 0 45 32
it 0 45 32
pertains 0 45 32
to 0 45 32
Russia. 0 45 32

Here’s 0 45 33
my 0 45 33
next 0 45 33
prediction: 0 45 33
the 0 45 33
congressional 0 45 33
investigations 0 45 33
into 0 45 33
Trump’s 0 45 33
supposed 0 45 33
“collusion” 0 45 33
with 0 45 33
Russia 0 45 33
are 0 45 33
about 0 45 33
to 0 45 33
fizzle 0 45 33
out. 0 45 33

That’s 0 45 34
because 0 45 34
I 0 45 34
believe 0 45 34
that 0 45 34
the 0 45 34
CIA, 0 45 34
as 0 45 34
part 0 45 34
of 0 45 34
its 0 45 34
deal 0 45 34
with 0 45 34
Trump, 0 45 34
will 0 45 34
order 0 45 34
its 0 45 34
assets 0 45 34
in 0 45 34
Congress 0 45 34
to 0 45 34
cease 0 45 34
and 0 45 34
desist 0 45 34
with 0 45 34
respect 0 45 34
to 0 45 34
that 0 45 34
investigation. 0 45 34

In 0 45 35
my 0 45 35
opinion, 0 45 35
that’s 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
price 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
CIA 0 45 35
had 0 45 35
to 0 45 35
pay 0 45 35
in 0 45 35
return 0 45 35
for 0 45 35
its 0 45 35
continued 0 45 35
cover-up 0 45 35
of 0 45 35
its 0 45 35
U.S. 0 45 35
regime-change 0 45 35
operation 0 45 35
in 0 45 35
November 0 45 35
1963. 0 45 35

Notice 0 45 36
something 0 45 36
else 0 45 36
about 0 45 36
the 0 45 36
deal 0 45 36
that 0 45 36
Trump 0 45 36
has 0 45 36
presumably 0 45 36
made 0 45 36
with 0 45 36
the 0 45 36
CIA: 0 45 36
The 0 45 36
secrecy 0 45 36
arrangement 0 45 36
extends 0 45 36
only 0 45 36
to 0 45 36
April. 0 45 36

Ostensibly, 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
next 0 45 37
six 0 45 37
months 0 45 37
are 0 45 37
needed 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
carefully 0 45 37
review 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
records 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
determine 0 45 37
whether 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
records 0 45 37
really 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
relate 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
“national 0 45 37
security.” 0 45 37
Regime 0 45 37
Change: 0 45 37
The 0 45 37
JFK... 0 45 37

Hornberger 0 45 37
Check 0 45 37
Amazon 0 45 37
for 0 45 37
Pricing. 0 45 37

Not 0 45 38
surprisingly, 0 45 38
the 0 45 38
mainstream 0 45 38
media 0 45 38
isn’t 1 45 38
even 1 45 38
questioning 1 45 38
that 1 45 38
ludicrous 1 45 38
notion. 1 45 38

For 0 45 39
more 0 45 39
than 0 45 39
50 0 45 39
years, 0 45 39
the 0 45 39
CIA 0 45 39
has 0 45 39
known 0 45 39
why 0 45 39
it 0 45 39
has 0 45 39
wanted 0 45 39
those 0 45 39
particular 0 45 39
records 0 45 39
to 0 45 39
be 0 45 39
kept 0 45 39
secret. 0 45 39

During 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
term 0 45 40
of 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
Assassination 0 45 40
Records 0 45 40
Review 0 45 40
Board 0 45 40
in 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
1990s, 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
CIA 0 45 40
decided 0 45 40
to 0 45 40
keep 0 45 40
these 0 45 40
particular 0 45 40
records 0 45 40
secret 0 45 40
for 0 45 40
another 0 45 40
25 0 45 40
years. 0 45 40

There 0 45 41
are 0 45 41
bound 0 45 41
to 0 45 41
be 0 45 41
lots 0 45 41
of 0 45 41
CIA 0 45 41
memoranda 0 45 41
detailing 0 45 41
why 0 45 41
it 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
imperative 0 45 41
to 0 45 41
keep 0 45 41
these 0 45 41
particular 0 45 41
records 0 45 41
secret 0 45 41
for 0 45 41
as 0 45 41
long 0 45 41
as 0 45 41
possible. 0 45 41

Finally, 0 45 42
the 0 45 42
CIA 0 45 42
made 0 45 42
its 0 45 42
request 0 45 42
for 0 45 42
secrecy 0 45 42
to 0 45 42
Trump 0 45 42
at 0 45 42
least 0 45 42
several 0 45 42
weeks 0 45 42
ago. 0 45 42

The 0 45 43
notion 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
CIA 0 45 43
suddenly 0 45 43
hit 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
yesterday 0 45 43
with 0 45 43
a 0 45 43
new 0 45 43
argument 0 45 43
as 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
why 0 45 43
“national 0 45 43
security” 0 45 43
would 0 45 43
be 0 45 43
threatened, 0 45 43
after 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
had 0 45 43
supposedly 0 45 43
already 0 45 43
rejected 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
arguments 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
had 0 45 43
been 0 45 43
presented 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
him, 0 45 43
causing 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
suddenly 0 45 43
change 0 45 43
his 0 45 43
mind, 0 45 43
is, 1 45 43
well, 1 45 43
laughable. 1 45 43

So, 0 45 44
why 0 45 44
the 0 45 44
April 0 45 44
deadline? 0 45 44

Why 0 45 45
not 0 45 45
extend 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
secrecy 0 45 45
for 0 45 45
another 0 45 45
25 0 45 45
years, 0 45 45
which 0 45 45
is 0 45 45
undoubtedly 0 45 45
what 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
CIA 0 45 45
wanted? 0 45 45

Because 0 45 46
Trump 0 45 46
obviously 0 45 46
needed 0 45 46
collateral 0 45 46
to 0 45 46
ensure 0 45 46
that 0 45 46
the 0 45 46
CIA 0 45 46
complied 0 45 46
with 0 45 46
its 0 45 46
part 0 45 46
of 0 45 46
the 0 45 46
deal. 0 45 46

If 0 45 47
Trump 0 45 47
had 0 45 47
extended 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
secrecy 0 45 47
for 0 45 47
25 0 45 47
years, 0 45 47
he 0 45 47
would 0 45 47
have 0 45 47
lost 0 45 47
leverage 0 45 47
to 0 45 47
ensure 0 45 47
that 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
CIA 0 45 47
complied 0 45 47
with 0 45 47
its 0 45 47
part 0 45 47
of 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
bargain. 0 45 47

Let’s 0 45 48
say, 0 45 48
hypothetically, 0 45 48
that 0 45 48
I’m 0 45 48
right: 0 45 48
that 0 45 48
the 0 45 48
CIA 0 45 48
agreed 0 45 48
to 0 45 48
use 0 45 48
its 0 45 48
assets 0 45 48
in 0 45 48
Congress 0 45 48
to 0 45 48
shut 0 45 48
down 0 45 48
the 0 45 48
Russia 0 45 48
investigation. 0 45 48

To 0 45 49
make 0 45 49
certain 0 45 49
that 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
CIA 0 45 49
fulfills 0 45 49
its 0 45 49
part 0 45 49
of 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
bargain, 0 45 49
Trump 0 45 49
would 0 45 49
need 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
April 0 45 49
deadline 0 45 49
so 0 45 49
that 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
threat 0 45 49
of 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
records 0 45 49
release 0 45 49
would 0 45 49
continue 0 45 49
hanging 0 45 49
over 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
CIA. 0 45 49

If 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
CIA 0 45 50
fails 0 45 50
to 0 45 50
fulfill 0 45 50
its 0 45 50
part 0 45 50
of 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
bargain, 0 45 50
Trump 0 45 50
releases 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
records 0 45 50
in 0 45 50
April. 0 45 50

If 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
CIA 0 45 51
squelches 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
Russia 0 45 51
investigations, 0 45 51
Trump 0 45 51
grants 0 45 51
another 0 45 51
extension 0 45 51
of 0 45 51
time 0 45 51
in 0 45 51
April. 0 45 51

Let’s 1 45 52
state 1 45 52
the 1 45 52
obvious: 1 45 52
The 1 45 52
CIA 1 45 52
records 1 45 52
that 1 45 52
are 1 45 52
still 1 45 52
being 1 45 52
suppressed 1 45 52
have 1 45 52
nothing 1 45 52
to 1 45 52
do 1 45 52
with 1 45 52
“national 1 45 52
security.” 1 45 52
They 1 45 52
have 1 45 52
everything 1 45 52
to 1 45 52
do 1 45 52
with 1 45 52
covering 1 45 52
up 1 45 52
the 1 45 52
CIA’s 1 45 52
role 1 45 52
in 0 45 52
the 0 45 52
U.S. 0 45 52
national-security 0 45 52
regime-change 0 45 52
operation 0 45 52
that 0 45 52
took 0 45 52
place 0 45 52
in 0 45 52

of 0 45 56
Lee 0 45 56

Oswald, 0 45 56
the 0 45 56

was 0 45 56
that 0 45 56
this 0 45 56
was 0 45 56
just 0 45 56
a 1 45 56

One 0 45 57
big 0 45 57
problem 0 45 57
is 0 45 57
the 0 45 57
official 0 45 57
story, 0 45 57
however, 0 45 57
requires 0 45 57
a 0 45 57
suspension 1 45 57
of 1 45 57
logic 1 45 57
and 1 45 57
common 1 45 57
sense. 1 45 57

For 0 45 58
anyone 0 45 58
who 0 45 58
has 0 45 58
a 0 45 58
mindset 0 45 58
of 0 45 58
conformity 0 45 58
and 0 45 58
deference 0 45 58
to 0 45 58
authority, 0 45 58
that 0 45 58
story 0 45 58
makes 0 45 58
sense 0 45 58
because 0 45 58
nothing 0 45 58
is 0 45 58
questioned 0 45 58
or 0 45 58
challenged. 0 45 58

For 1 45 59
anyone 1 45 59
who 1 45 59
has 1 45 59
a 1 45 59
critical, 1 45 59
analytical, 1 45 59
independent 1 45 59
mindset, 1 45 59
the 1 45 59
official 1 45 59
story 1 45 59
is 1 45 59
filled 1 45 59
with 1 45 59
holes. 1 45 59

For 0 45 60
example, 0 45 60
how 0 45 60
many 0 45 60
communist 0 45 60
Marines 0 45 60
have 0 45 60
you 0 45 60
ever 0 45 60
heard 0 45 60
of? 0 45 60

Why 0 45 61
would 0 45 61
a 0 45 61
genuine 0 45 61
communist 0 45 61
join 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
Marines 0 45 61
in 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
first 0 45 61
place, 0 45 61
especially 0 45 61
since 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
Marines 0 45 61
had 0 45 61
just 0 45 61
recently 0 45 61
killed 0 45 61
millions 0 45 61
of 0 45 61
North 0 45 61
Korean 0 45 61
communists? 0 45 61

Why 0 45 62
would 0 45 62
a 0 45 62
genuine 0 45 62
communist 0 45 62
join 0 45 62
the 0 45 62
Marines 0 45 62
knowing 0 45 62
that 0 45 62
he 0 45 62
could 0 45 62
be 0 45 62
called 0 45 62
upon 0 45 62
at 0 45 62
any 0 45 62
moment 0 45 62
to 0 45 62

to 0 45 62

or 0 45 62
elsewhere 0 45 62
to 0 45 62
kill 0 45 62

How 0 45 63
many 0 45 63

do 0 45 63
you 0 45 63
know 0 45 63

are 0 45 68

It 1 45 69
skewers 1 45 69
them. 1 45 69

Why, 0 45 70
just 0 45 70
look 0 45 70
at 0 45 70
how 0 45 70
they 1 45 70

The 0 45 73
entire 0 45 73
U.S. 0 45 73
anti-communist 0 45 73
crusade, 0 45 73
including 0 45 73

than 0 45 73

U.S. 0 45 73
soldiers 0 45 73
died 0 45 73

And 0 45 74
they’re 0 45 74
going 0 45 74
to 0 45 74
tell 0 45 74
us 0 45 74
that 0 45 74

Don’t 1 45 75
make 1 45 75
me 1 45 75
laugh. 1 45 75

Soon 0 45 76
after 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Warren 0 45 76
Commission 0 45 76
was 0 45 76
established, 0 45 76
Warren 0 45 76
called 0 45 76
a 0 45 76
super-secret 0 45 76
meeting 0 45 76
of 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
commission 0 45 76
to 0 45 76
address 0 45 76
information 0 45 76
that 0 45 76
had 0 45 76
come 0 45 76
into 0 45 76
Warren’s 0 45 76
possession. 0 45 76

That 0 45 77
information 0 45 77
was 0 45 77
that 0 45 77
Oswald 0 45 77
was 0 45 77
actually 0 45 77
working 0 45 77
for 0 45 77
U.S. 0 45 77
intelligence. 0 45 77

Yes, 0 45 78
a 0 45 78
spy, 0 45 78
the 0 45 78
type 0 45 78
of 0 45 78
people 0 45 78
that 0 45 78
work 0 45 78
for 0 45 78
the 0 45 78
CIA. 0 45 78

That 0 45 79
would 0 45 79
make 0 45 79
sense, 0 45 79
especially 0 45 79
given 0 45 79
that 0 45 79
the 0 45 79
Marine 0 45 79
Corps 0 45 79
is 0 45 79
a 0 45 79

Semper 0 45 80
fidelis! 0 45 80

Now, 0 45 81
suddenly, 0 45 81
all 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
circumstantial 0 45 81
evidence 0 45 81
in 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
Kennedy 0 45 81
assassination 0 45 81
falls 0 45 81
into 0 45 81
place. 0 45 81

It 0 45 82
begins 0 45 82
to 0 45 82
make 0 45 82
sense. 0 45 82

The 0 45 83
mosaic 0 45 83
starts 0 45 83
to 0 45 83
be 0 45 83
filled 0 45 83
out: 0 45 83
They 1 45 83
needed 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
get 1 45 83
rid 1 45 83
of 1 45 83
Kennedy 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
protect 1 45 83
national 1 45 83
security 1 45 83
and 1 45 83
elevate 1 45 83
Johnson, 1 45 83
who 1 45 83
had 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
same 1 45 83
anti-communist 1 45 83
mindset 1 45 83
as 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
Pentagon 1 45 83
and 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
CIA, 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
presidency. 1 45 83

Unlike 0 45 84
JFK, 0 45 84
who 0 45 84
had 0 45 84
begun 0 45 84
withdrawing 0 45 84

more 0 45 85

But 0 45 86
to 0 45 86
avoid 0 45 86
detection, 0 45 86
they 0 45 86
needed 0 45 86
a 0 45 86
patsy, 0 45 86
which 0 45 86
is 0 45 86
the 0 45 86

that 0 45 86
Oswald 0 45 86
used 0 45 86
after 0 45 86
his 0 45 86
arrest. 0 45 86

They 0 45 87

someone 0 45 87
for 0 45 87

what 0 45 88

to 0 45 88

the 0 45 89
scheme, 0 45 89
obviously, 0 45 89
would 0 45 89
be 0 45 89
to 0 45 89
establish 0 45 89
Oswald’s 0 45 89
communist 0 45 89
bona 0 45 89
fides. 0 45 89

That’s 0 45 90
why 0 45 90
he 0 45 90
was 0 45 90
sent 0 45 90
to 0 45 90
New 0 45 90
Orleans, 0 45 90
where, 0 45 90
contradictorily, 0 45 90
he 0 45 90
would 0 45 90
work 0 45 90
for 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
right-wing 0 45 90
business 0 45 90
owner, 0 45 90
work 0 45 90
with 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
right-wing 0 45 90
former 0 45 90
FBI 0 45 90
agent, 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
conduct 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
public 0 45 90
protest 0 45 90
in 0 45 90
favor 0 45 90
of 0 45 90
Fidel 0 45 90
Castro 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
Cuba. 0 45 90

It 0 45 91
was 0 45 91
also 0 45 91
why 0 45 91
he 0 45 91
was 0 45 91
sent 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
Mexico 0 45 91
City, 0 45 91
where 0 45 91
he 0 45 91
would 0 45 91
be 0 45 91
ordered 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
visit 0 45 91
the 0 45 91
Cuban 0 45 91
and 0 45 91
Soviet 0 45 91
Embassies, 0 45 91
no 1 45 91
doubt 1 45 91
being 1 45 91
told 1 45 91
that 1 45 91
he 1 45 91
was 1 45 91
being 1 45 91
prepared 1 45 91
for 1 45 91
an 1 45 91
important 1 45 91
mission, 1 45 91
maybe 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
enter 0 45 91
Cuba 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
assassinate 0 45 91
Castro. 0 45 91

But 0 45 92
no 1 45 92
government 1 45 92
operation 1 45 92
ever 1 45 92
goes 1 45 92
perfectly. 1 45 92

Things 0 45 93
obviously 0 45 93
went 0 45 93
dreadfully 1 45 93
wrong 1 45 93
with 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
Mexico 0 45 93
City 0 45 93
operation 0 45 93
because 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
investigation 0 45 93
into 0 45 93
it 0 45 93
after 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
assassination 0 45 93
was 0 45 93
quickly 0 45 93
shut 0 45 93
down. 0 45 93

Today, 0 45 94
it 0 45 94
remains 0 45 94
shrouded 1 45 94
in 1 45 94
mystery. 1 45 94

And 0 45 95
guess 0 45 95
what 0 45 95
is 0 45 95
included 0 45 95
in 0 45 95
the 0 45 95
records 0 45 95
that 0 45 95
Trump 0 45 95
has 0 45 95
now 0 45 95
agreed 0 45 95
to 0 45 95
continue 0 45 95
suppressing. 0 45 95

You 0 45 96
guessed 0 45 96
it! 0 45 96

The 0 45 97

records 0 45 97
relating 0 45 97
to 0 45 97

City! 0 45 97

Ever 0 45 98
since 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
assassination, 0 45 98
the 1 45 98
CIA 1 45 98
has 1 45 98
argued 1 45 98
that 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
release 1 45 98
of 1 45 98
any 1 45 98
of 1 45 98
its 1 45 98
JFK 1 45 98
records 1 45 98
would 1 45 98
threaten 1 45 98
“national 1 45 98
security.” 1 45 98
One 0 45 98
thing 0 45 98
is 0 45 98
for 0 45 98
sure 0 45 98
and 0 45 98
undeniable: 0 45 98
Despite 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
release 0 45 98
of 0 45 98
many 0 45 98
of 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
CIA’s 0 45 98
records 0 45 98
in 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
1990s 0 45 98
and 0 45 98
yesterday, 0 45 98
the 1 45 98
United 1 45 98
States 1 45 98
did 1 45 98
not 1 45 98
fall 1 45 98
into 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
ocean 1 45 98
or 1 45 98
fall 1 45 98
to 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
communists. 1 45 98

And 0 45 99
neither 0 45 99
would 0 45 99
it 0 45 99
have 0 45 99
done 0 45 99
so 0 45 99
if 0 45 99
Trump 0 45 99
had 0 45 99
not 0 45 99

made 0 48 2

but 0 48 2
after 0 48 2
just 0 48 2
three 0 48 2

tried 0 48 2
to 0 48 2

Khweis 0 48 3
is 0 48 3
an 0 48 3
interesting 0 48 3
case 0 48 3
for 0 48 3
numerous 0 48 3
reasons. 0 48 3

First, 0 48 4
there 0 48 4
was 0 48 4
no 0 48 4
particular 0 48 4
event 0 48 4
or 0 48 4
friend 0 48 4
who 0 48 4
ignited 0 48 4
his 0 48 4
radicalization. 0 48 4

Second, 0 48 5
he 0 48 5
successfully 0 48 5
made 0 48 5
it 0 48 5
to 0 48 5
Syria 0 48 5
via 0 48 5
Turkey. 0 48 5

And 0 48 6
third, 0 48 6
he 0 48 6
came 0 48 6
from 0 48 6
a 0 48 6
secular 0 48 6
home 0 48 6
that 0 48 6
was 0 48 6
stable. 0 48 6

His 0 48 7
life 0 48 7
before 0 48 7
joining 0 48 7
the 0 48 7
caliphate 0 48 7
was 0 48 7
unremarkable. 0 48 7

He 0 48 8
obtained 0 48 8
an 0 48 8
associate’s 0 48 8
degree 0 48 8
in 0 48 8
criminal 0 48 8
justice 0 48 8
and 0 48 8
worked 0 48 8
as 0 48 8
a 0 48 8
bus 0 48 8
driver 0 48 8
in 0 48 8
Alexandria, 0 48 8
Va. 0 48 8

He 0 48 9
also 0 48 9
abused 0 48 9
marijuana 0 48 9
over 0 48 9
the 0 48 9
past 0 48 9
few 0 48 9
years. 0 48 9

Khweis’ 0 48 10
defense 0 48 10
attorney 0 48 10
said 0 48 10
Friday 0 48 10
that 0 48 10
even 0 48 10
he 0 48 10
has 0 48 10
no 0 48 10
idea 0 48 10
what 0 48 10
caused 0 48 10
Khweis 0 48 10
to 0 48 10
join 0 48 10
ISIS. 0 48 10

“It’s 0 48 11
difficult 0 48 11
to 0 48 11
understand,” 0 48 11
defense 0 48 11
attorney 0 48 11
John 0 48 11
Zwerling 0 48 11
said 0 48 11
Friday. 0 48 11

“We 0 48 12
don’t 0 48 12
really 0 48 12
know 0 48 12
what 0 48 12
caused 0 48 12
him 0 48 12
to 0 48 12
travel 0 48 12
to 0 48 12
Syria.” 0 48 12

From 0 48 13
the 0 48 13
very 0 48 13
start 0 48 13
of 0 48 13
his 0 48 13
trial, 0 48 13
Khweis 0 48 13
said 0 48 13
he 0 48 13
regretted 0 48 13
his 0 48 13
actions 0 48 13
and 0 48 13
said 0 48 13
his 0 48 13
decision 0 48 13
to 0 48 13
join 0 48 13
ISIS 0 48 13
in 0 48 13
December 0 48 13
2015 0 48 13
was 0 48 13
a 0 48 13
drunken 1 48 13
one. 1 48 13

“I 0 48 14
hated 0 48 14
myself 0 48 14
for 0 48 14
making 0 48 14
the 0 48 14
worst 0 48 14
decision 0 48 14
I 0 48 14
ever 0 48 14
made,” 0 48 14
Khweis 0 48 14
wrote 0 48 14
to 0 48 14
the 0 48 14
judge 0 48 14
in 0 48 14
a 0 48 14
letter. 0 48 14

“I 0 48 15
ruined 1 48 15
my 1 48 15
life 1 48 15
and 1 48 15
my 1 48 15
family’s 1 48 15
life.” 1 48 15

Prosecutors, 0 48 16
who 0 48 16
pushed 0 48 16
for 0 48 16
35 0 48 16
years 0 48 16
in 0 48 16
prison, 0 48 16
accused 0 48 16
Khweis 0 48 16
of 0 48 16
lying 0 48 16
repeatedly 0 48 16
over 0 48 16
the 0 48 16
last 0 48 16
15 0 48 16
months 0 48 16
of 0 48 16
the 0 48 16
trial. 0 48 16

When 0 48 17
Khweis 0 48 17
was 0 48 17
first 0 48 17
captured 0 48 17
in 0 48 17
Iraq 0 48 17
in 0 48 17
March 0 48 17
2016, 0 48 17
he 0 48 17
told 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
FBI 0 48 17
that 0 48 17
he 0 48 17
was 0 48 17
following 0 48 17
a 0 48 17
young 0 48 17
woman. 0 48 17

However, 0 48 18
that 0 48 18
young 0 48 18
woman 0 48 18
didn’t 0 48 18
exist. 0 48 18

“This 0 48 19
defendant 0 48 19
executed 1 48 19
his 1 48 19

to 1 48 19

“He 0 48 20

He 0 48 21

He 1 48 22

the 0 49 2

days. 0 49 26

They 0 49 27
compiled 0 49 27

They 0 49 28
spent 0 49 28
several 0 49 28
minutes 0 49 28
answering 0 49 28
specific 0 49 28
questions. 0 49 28

They 0 49 29
released 0 49 29
a 0 49 29
comprehensive 0 49 29
timeline, 0 49 29
which 0 49 29
ended 0 49 29
up 0 49 29
being 0 49 29
wrong. 0 49 29

They 0 49 30
took 0 49 30
it 0 49 30
back, 0 49 30
and 0 49 30
tried 0 49 30
to 0 49 30
clarify 0 49 30
the 0 49 30
errors, 0 49 30
but 0 49 30
instead 0 49 30
caused 0 49 30
more 0 49 30
confusion. 0 49 30

By 0 49 31
Oct. 0 49 31
13 0 49 31
— 0 49 31
the 0 49 31

public 0 49 31
— 0 49 31
something 0 49 31
had 0 49 31
changed. 0 49 31

The 0 49 32
sheriff, 0 49 32
who 0 49 32
had 0 49 32
been 0 49 32
straightforward 0 49 32
and 0 49 32
stern, 0 49 32
was 0 49 32
now 0 49 32
emotional 0 49 32
and 0 49 32
at 0 49 32
times 0 49 32
combative. 0 49 32

Both 0 49 33
he 0 49 33
and 0 49 33
the 0 49 33
FBI 0 49 33
failed 0 49 33
to 0 49 33
provide 0 49 33
much 0 49 33
new 0 49 33
information, 0 49 33
and 0 49 33
at 0 49 33
the 0 49 33
end 0 49 33
of 0 49 33
the 0 49 33
meeting, 0 49 33
they 0 49 33
refused 0 49 33
to 0 49 33

questions. 0 49 33

Since 0 49 34
that 0 49 34

the 0 49 34
only 0 49 34
person 0 49 34
who 0 49 34

more 0 49 34

on 0 49 34

His 0 49 35

He 0 49 37
hasn’t 0 49 37

on 0 49 38
Thursday, 0 49 38
when 0 49 38
asked 0 49 38
why 0 49 38
there 0 49 38
had 0 49 38
been 0 49 38
no 0 49 38
significant 0 49 38

“It’s 0 49 39

At 0 49 40
least 0 49 40
twice 0 49 40
this 0 49 40
week, 0 49 40
the 0 49 40
Las 0 49 40

Review-Journal 0 49 40
has 0 49 40
asked 0 49 40
to 0 49 40
speak 0 49 40
with 0 49 40
Sheriff 0 49 40
Joe 0 49 40
Lombardo 0 49 40
about 0 49 40
the 0 49 40
shooting 0 49 40
investigation. 0 49 40

Both 0 49 41
times, 0 49 41
reporters 0 49 41
were 0 49 41
told 0 49 41
by 0 49 41
Carla 0 49 41
Alston, 0 49 41
the 0 49 41
Police 0 49 41
Department’s 0 49 41
director 0 49 41
of 0 49 41
communications, 0 49 41
that 0 49 41
the 0 49 41
sheriff 0 49 41
“will 0 49 41
not 0 49 41
be 0 49 41
conducting 0 49 41
interviews.” 0 49 41
“As 0 49 41
he 0 49 41
has 0 49 41
stated 0 49 41
previously, 0 49 41
the 0 49 41
case 0 49 41
is 0 49 41
still 0 49 41
ongoing” 0 49 41
she 0 49 41
said 0 49 41
in 0 49 41
an 0 49 41
email 0 49 41
Thursday. 0 49 41

“Another 0 49 42
media 0 49 42
briefing 0 49 42
will 0 49 42
be 0 49 42
held 0 49 42

we 0 49 42
have 0 49 42
new 0 49 42
and 0 49 42
accurate 0 49 42
information.” 0 49 42
When 0 49 42
asked 0 49 42
when 0 49 42
that 0 49 42
briefing 0 49 42
would 0 49 42
be, 0 49 42
Alston 0 49 42
guessed 0 49 42
it 0 49 42
could 0 49 42
occur 0 49 42
in 0 49 42
the 0 49 42
next 0 49 42
two 0 49 42
weeks. 0 49 42

The 0 49 43
Review-Journal 0 49 43
also 0 49 43
specifically 0 49 43
asked 0 49 43
about 0 49 43
the 0 49 43
more 0 49 43
than 0 49 43
50,000 0 49 43
hours 0 49 43
of 0 49 43
overtime 0 49 43
that 0 49 43
Metro 0 49 43
officers 0 49 43
have 0 49 43
logged 0 49 43
since 0 49 43
Oct. 0 49 43
1 0 49 43
on 0 49 43
work 0 49 43
directly 0 49 43
related 0 49 43
to 0 49 43
the 0 49 43
shooting 0 49 43
investigation. 0 49 43

“Investigators 0 49 44
have 0 49 44
made 0 49 44
progress 0 49 44
on 0 49 44

the 0 49 44
last 0 49 44
few 0 49 44
years 0 49 44
— 0 49 44
and 0 49 44
they’re 0 49 44
still 0 49 44
not 0 49 44
done,” 0 49 44
Alston 0 49 44
said. 0 49 44

“We 0 49 45
still 0 49 45
have 0 49 45
officers 0 49 45
dedicated 0 49 45
to 0 49 45
this 0 49 45
case 0 49 45
24/7.” 0 49 45
She 0 49 45
agreed 0 49 45
that 0 49 45
members 0 49 45
of 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
public 0 49 45
have 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
right 0 49 45
to 0 49 45
know 0 49 45
more, 0 49 45
“but 0 49 45
they 0 49 45
have 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
right 0 49 45
to 0 49 45
accurate 0 49 45
information 0 49 45
and 0 49 45
not 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
speculation 0 49 45
… 0 49 45
that 0 49 45
has 0 49 45
filled 0 49 45
so 0 49 45
many 0 49 45
news 0 49 45
stories 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
past 0 49 45
month.” 0 49 45
Nearly 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
month 0 49 45
after 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
mass 0 49 45
shooting, 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
gunman’s 0 49 45
motive 0 49 45
remains 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
mystery. 0 49 45

More 0 49 46
straightforward 0 49 46
questions 0 49 46
also 0 49 46
remain 0 49 46
unanswered, 0 49 46
including 0 49 46
whether 0 49 46
the 0 49 46
32nd 0 49 46
floor 0 49 46
of 0 49 46
Mandalay 0 49 46
Bay 0 49 46
— 0 49 46
where 0 49 46
the 0 49 46
gunman 0 49 46
was 0 49 46
staying 0 49 46
— 0 49 46
has 0 49 46
surveillance 0 49 46
cameras, 0 49 46
and 0 49 46
what 0 49 46
exactly 0 49 46
investigators 0 49 46
collected 0 49 46
in 0 49 46
the 0 49 46
gunman’s 0 49 46
hotel 0 49 46
room 0 49 46
and 0 49 46
homes. 0 49 46

Authorities 0 49 47
also 0 49 47
have 0 49 47
not 0 49 47
said 0 49 47
how 0 49 47
long 0 49 47
the 0 49 47
gunman 0 49 47
had 0 49 47
a 0 49 47
“do 0 49 47
not 0 49 47
disturb” 0 49 47
sign 0 49 47
on 0 49 47
his 0 49 47
hotel 0 49 47
door, 0 49 47
and 0 49 47
whether 0 49 47
hotel 0 49 47
staff 0 49 47
saw 0 49 47
something 0 49 47
suspicious 0 49 47
in 0 49 47
his 0 49 47

but 0 49 47
failed 0 49 47
to 0 49 47
report 0 49 47
it. 0 49 47

Though 0 49 48
authorities 0 49 48
have 0 49 48
described 0 49 48
the 0 49 48

of 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
Vatican’s 0 52 6

warned 0 52 6
Pope 0 52 6

that 0 52 6
he 0 52 6

confusion” 0 52 6
among 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
faithful 0 52 6
and 0 52 6
bishops. 0 52 6

He 0 52 7
wrote 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
the 0 52 7
pope, 0 52 7
“To 1 52 7
teach 1 52 7

such 1 52 7
an 1 52 7
intentional 1 52 7
lack 1 52 7
of 1 52 7

He 0 52 7
added 0 52 7
that 0 52 7

the 0 52 7
appointment 0 52 7

“who 0 52 7

more 0 52 8
prophetically 0 52 8
than 0 52 8
he 0 52 8

perhaps 0 52 8
intended, 0 52 8
“I 0 52 8

think 0 52 8

Neither 0 52 9

writing 0 52 9
the 0 52 9

in 0 52 10
his 0 52 10

we 0 52 11

that 0 52 12
Fr. 0 52 12

had 0 52 12
been 0 52 12

Of 0 52 13
course, 0 52 13
the 0 52 13
Twitterverse 0 52 13
is 0 52 13
busy 0 52 13
commenting 0 52 13
on 0 52 13
the 0 52 13
irony: 0 52 13
how 0 52 13
a 0 52 13
man 0 52 13
expressing 0 52 13
grave 0 52 13

fired. 0 52 14
Perhaps 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
most 0 52 14
astonishing 0 52 14
aspect 0 52 14
of 0 52 14
this 0 52 14
little 1 52 14
incident 1 52 14
is 0 52 14
just 0 52 14
how 0 52 14
completely 0 52 14
blind 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
US 0 52 14
bishops 0 52 14
– 0 52 14
as 0 52 14
with 0 52 14
nearly 0 52 14
all 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
episcopate 0 52 14
– 0 52 14
are 0 52 14
to 0 52 14
what 0 52 14
political 0 52 14
analysts 0 52 14
call 0 52 14

the 0 52 15
“optics”. 0 52 15
Political 0 52 15
consultants 0 52 15
often 0 52 15
ask: 0 52 15
how 0 52 15

does 0 52 16
it 0 52 16
look? 0 52 16
And 0 52 16
it 0 52 16
looks 0 52 16

extremely 1 52 17
bad. 1 52 17
As 0 52 17
though 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
fog 0 52 17
of 0 52 17
irony 0 52 17
weren’t 0 52 17
thick 0 52 17
enough, 0 52 17
in 0 52 17
response 0 52 17
to 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
outrage 0 52 17
from 0 52 17
Catholics, 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
USCCB 0 52 17

it 0 52 18

Some 0 52 20
of 0 52 20

In 0 52 26
his 0 52 26

Fr. 0 52 26
Weinandy 0 52 26

I 0 52 33
would 0 52 33
be 0 52 33

Notable 0 52 49
in 0 52 49

its 0 52 49

The 0 52 50

of 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
Petrine 0 52 51
ministry.” 0 52 51
In 0 52 51
an 0 52 51
interview 0 52 51
with 0 52 51
Crux, 0 52 51
Weinandy 0 52 51
said 0 52 51
he 0 52 51
is 0 52 51
not 0 52 51
afraid 0 52 51
of 0 52 51
reprisals 0 52 51
but 0 52 51
“more 0 52 51
concerned 0 52 51
about 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
good 0 52 51
that 0 52 51
my 0 52 51
letter 0 52 51
might 0 52 51
do.” 0 52 51
The 0 52 51
letter 0 52 51
“expresses 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
concerns 0 52 51
of 0 52 51
many 0 52 51
more 0 52 51
people 0 52 51
than 0 52 51
just 0 52 51
me, 0 52 51
ordinary 0 52 51
people 0 52 51
who’ve 0 52 51
come 0 52 51
to 0 52 51
me 0 52 51
with 0 52 51
their 0 52 51

questions 0 52 52
and 0 52 52
apprehensions. 0 52 52
I 0 52 52
wanted 0 52 52
them 0 52 52

to 0 52 53
know 0 52 53
that 0 52 53
I 0 52 53
listened.” 0 52 53
“I 0 52 53
have 1 52 53
done 1 52 53
what 1 52 53
I 1 52 53
believe 1 52 53
God 1 52 53

wanted 1 52 54
me 1 52 54
to 1 52 54

do,[1]” 1 52 55
he 0 52 55
said. 0 52 55
In 0 52 55
fact, 0 52 55
Fr. 0 52 55
Weinandy 0 52 55
has 0 52 55
bolstered 1 52 55
my 1 52 55
own 1 52 55
“Great 1 52 55
Clarifier” 1 52 55
theory, 1 52 55
saying 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
this 0 52 55
pontificate, 0 52 55
and 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
lack 0 52 55
of 0 52 55
response 0 52 55
to 0 52 55
it 0 52 55
from 0 52 55
priests 0 52 55
and 0 52 55
bishops, 0 52 55
is 0 52 55
being 0 52 55
allowed 0 52 55
by 0 52 55
God 0 52 55
in 0 52 55
order 0 52 55
to 0 52 55
reveal 0 52 55
“just 0 52 55
how 0 52 55
weak 0 52 55
is 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
faith 0 52 55
of 0 52 55
many 0 52 55
within 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
Church,” 0 52 55
He 0 52 55
added 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
Francis 0 52 55
has 0 52 55
revealed 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
many 0 52 55
in 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
Church 0 52 55
“hold 0 52 55
harmful 0 52 55
theological 0 52 55

and 0 52 56
pastoral 0 52 56
views.” 0 52 56
Which 0 52 56
inevitably 0 52 56
brings 0 52 56
to 0 52 56
mind 0 52 56
other 0 52 56
responses 0 52 56
that 0 52 56
have 0 52 56
not 0 52 56
been 0 52 56
quite 0 52 56

so 0 52 57
clear, 0 52 57
nor 0 52 57
so 0 52 57
pastoral. 0 52 57
When 0 52 57
Cardinal 0 52 57
Muller 0 52 57
was 0 52 57
removed 0 52 57
abruptly 0 52 57
from 0 52 57
his 0 52 57
position 0 52 57
as 0 52 57
head 0 52 57
of 0 52 57
the 0 52 57
CDF, 0 52 57
the 0 52 57
conservative 0 52 57
Catholic 0 52 57
world 0 52 57
wailed 0 52 57
that 0 52 57
it 0 52 57
was 0 52 57
another 0 52 57
case 0 52 57
of 0 52 57
a 0 52 57

“good” 0 52 58
prelate 0 52 58
being 0 52 58
got 0 52 58
rid 0 52 58
of. 0 52 58
And 0 52 58
it 0 52 58
seems 0 52 58
clear 0 52 58
from 0 52 58
the 0 52 58
way 0 52 58
it 0 52 58
was 0 52 58
done, 0 52 58
and 0 52 58
the 0 52 58
way 0 52 58
Francis 0 52 58
treated 0 52 58
Muller 0 52 58
in 0 52 58
general, 0 52 58

that 0 52 59
he 0 52 59
was 0 52 59
indeed 0 52 59
got 1 52 59
rid 1 52 59
of. 1 52 59
But 0 52 59
his 0 52 59
depiction 0 52 59
by 0 52 59
conservative 0 52 59
writers 0 52 59
as 0 52 59
a 0 52 59
beleaguered 0 52 59
champion 0 52 59
of 0 52 59
Catholic 0 52 59
orthodoxy 0 52 59
persecuted 0 52 59
by 0 52 59
the 0 52 59
regime 0 52 59
for 0 52 59
his 0 52 59
faithfulness 0 52 59
betrays 0 52 59
a 0 52 59
somewhat 0 52 59
selective 0 52 59

memory 0 52 60
and 0 52 60
short 0 52 60
attention 0 52 60
span. 0 52 60
Ed 0 52 60
Pentin 0 52 60
has 0 52 60
a 0 52 60
long 0 52 60
file 0 52 60
of 0 52 60
interviews 0 52 60
and 0 52 60
articles 0 52 60
about 0 52 60
Muller 0 52 60
that 0 52 60
clearly 0 52 60
show 0 52 60
his 0 52 60
complete 0 52 60
inability 0 52 60
to 0 52 60
make 0 52 60

up 0 52 61
his 0 52 61
mind 0 52 61
whose 0 52 61
side 0 52 61
he’s 0 52 61
on. 0 52 61
A 0 52 61
quick 0 52 61
examination 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
Muller’s 0 52 61
interviews 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
statements 0 52 61
reveal 0 52 61
an 0 52 61
irresolute 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
ultimately 0 52 61
calculating 0 52 61
mind 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
a 0 52 61
man 0 52 61
who 0 52 61
is 0 52 61
– 0 52 61
so 0 52 61
I 0 52 61
am 0 52 61
told 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
sources 0 52 61
close 0 52 61
to 0 52 61
him 0 52 61
– 0 52 61
motivated 0 52 61
mainly 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
a 0 52 61
puerile 0 52 61
desire 0 52 61
to 0 52 61
be 0 52 61
approved 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
the 1 52 61
“cool 1 52 61
kids” 1 52 61
in 1 52 61
the 1 52 61
Vatican, 1 52 61
on 0 52 61
the 0 52 61
one 0 52 61
hand, 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
an 0 52 61
unshakeable 0 52 61
conviction 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
his 0 52 61
own 0 52 61
theological 0 52 61

brilliance 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
other. 0 52 62
Most 0 52 62
recently, 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
October 0 52 62
30th, 0 52 62
Crux 0 52 62
quoted 0 52 62
him 0 52 62
under 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
headline, 0 52 62
“Cardinal 0 52 62
Muller 0 52 62
backs 0 52 62
Pope 0 52 62

against 0 52 62
critics 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
‘Amoris 0 52 62
Laetitia’” 0 52 62
in 0 52 62
which 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
former 0 52 62
head 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
CDF 0 52 62
has 0 52 62
at 0 52 62
last 0 52 62
climbed 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
board 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
Kasperian 0 52 62
train 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
reception 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
Communion 0 52 62

for 0 52 63
unrepentant 0 52 63
adulterers. 0 52 63
Signaling 1 52 63
furiously 1 52 63
with 0 52 63
the 0 52 63
trendy 0 52 63
FrancisChurch 0 52 63
buzzwords 0 52 63
and 0 52 63
even 0 52 63
trendier 0 52 63
blithering 1 52 63
incoherence, 1 52 63
Muller 0 52 63
writes 0 52 63
that 0 52 63
“mitigating 0 52 63
factors 0 52 63
in 0 52 63
guilt,” 0 52 63
can 0 52 63
lead, 0 52 63
couples 0 52 63
in 0 52 63
“an 0 52 63
uncertain 0 52 63
marital 0 52 63
situation” 0 52 63
through 0 52 63
a 0 52 63
“path 0 52 63
of 0 52 63
repentance” 0 52 63
– 0 52 63
always 0 52 63
“accompanied” 0 52 63
by 0 52 63
an 0 52 63
exquisitely 0 52 63
sensitive 0 52 63
confessor 0 52 63
– 0 52 63
to 0 52 63
a 0 52 63
point 0 52 63
where 0 52 63
the 0 52 63
reception 0 52 63

of 0 52 64
Communion 0 52 64
is 0 52 64
no 0 52 64
longer 0 52 64
sinful. 0 52 64
Presumably 1 52 64
because 1 52 64
adultery 1 52 64

itself 1 52 65
is 1 52 65
no 1 52 65
longer 1 52 65
sinful. 1 52 65

Or 0 52 66
sacrilege 0 52 66

either, 0 52 67
I 0 52 67
guess. 0 52 67
Or 0 52 67
something. 0 52 67
Somehow 0 52 67
the 0 52 67
“new 0 52 67
evangelization” 0 52 67
is 0 52 67
involved 0 52 67
in 0 52 67
this, 0 52 67
though 0 52 67
it’s 0 52 67
unclear 0 52 67
how 0 52 67
exactly 0 52 67
it 0 52 67
makes 0 52 67
adultery 0 52 67
and 0 52 67
sacrilege 0 52 67
OK. 0 52 67
Also, 0 52 67
it’s 0 52 67
very 0 52 67
important 0 52 67
to 0 52 67
fulfill 0 52 67
the 0 52 67
Sunday 0 52 67
Mass 0 52 67
obligation, 0 52 67
and 0 52 67
as 0 52 67
everyone 0 52 67
knows, 0 52 67
one 0 52 67
can’t 0 52 67
possibly 0 52 67
go 0 52 67
to 0 52 67
Mass 0 52 67
on 0 52 67
a 0 52 67

Sunday 0 52 68
without 0 52 68
receiving 0 52 68
Communion. 0 52 68
We 0 52 68
hear 0 52 68
again, 0 52 68
as 0 52 68
we 0 52 68
did 0 52 68
incessantly 0 52 68
from 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
Kasperians 0 52 68
at 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
Synods, 0 52 68
about 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
hard 0 52 68
case 0 52 68
of 0 52 68
the 1 52 68
poor, 1 52 68
poor 1 52 68
woman 1 52 68
who 0 52 68
has 0 52 68
been 0 52 68
abandoned 0 52 68
by 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
first 0 52 68
husband, 0 52 68
and 0 52 68
who 0 52 68
“finds 0 52 68
no 0 52 68
other 0 52 68
way 0 52 68
out 0 52 68
than 0 52 68
to 0 52 68
entrust 0 52 68
oneself 0 52 68
to 0 52 68
a 0 52 68
kind-hearted 0 52 68
person,” 0 52 68
… 0 52 68
with 1 52 68
whom, 1 52 68
I 1 52 68
guess, 1 52 68
she 1 52 68
has 1 52 68
also 1 52 68
no 1 52 68

choice 1 52 69
but 1 52 69
to 1 52 69
have 1 52 69
sexual 1 52 69
relations. 1 52 69

Because 1 52 70
of 1 52 70
kind-heartedness. 1 52 70
Anyway, 0 52 70
the 0 52 70
result 0 52 70
of 0 52 70
this 0 52 70
is 0 52 70
a 0 52 70
“marriage-like 0 52 70
relationship” 0 52 70
about 0 52 70
which 0 52 70
confessors 0 52 70
have 0 52 70
to 0 52 70
be 0 52 70

very 0 52 71
careful 0 52 71
not 0 52 71
to 0 52 71

say 0 52 72
mean 0 52 72
things. 0 52 72
Or 0 52 72
be 0 52 72
too 0 52 72
“extreme”. 0 52 72
It’s 0 52 72
very 0 52 72
important 0 52 72
for 0 52 72
him 0 52 72
to 0 52 72
avoid 0 52 72
a 0 52 72
“cheap 0 52 72
adaptation 0 52 72
to 0 52 72
the 0 52 72
relativistic 1 52 72
Zeitgeist,” 1 52 72
on 0 52 72
one 0 52 72
side, 0 52 72
and 0 52 72
a 0 52 72
“cold 0 52 72
application 0 52 72
of 0 52 72
the 0 52 72
dogmatic 0 52 72
commandments 0 52 72
and 0 52 72

the 0 52 73
canonical 0 52 73
rules,” 0 52 73
on 0 52 73
the 0 52 73
other. 0 52 73

Because 0 52 74
that 0 52 74

could 0 52 75
be 0 52 75
too 0 52 75
polarizing. 0 52 75
And 0 52 75
mean. 0 52 75
And 0 52 75
anyway, 0 52 75
sins 0 52 75
of 0 52 75
the 0 52 75

flesh 0 52 76
aren’t 0 52 76
the 0 52 76
worst 0 52 76
things 0 52 76
ever. 0 52 76
There 0 52 76
are, 0 52 76
like, 0 52 76
“different 0 52 76

levels” 0 52 77
of 0 52 77
gravity, 0 52 77
you 0 52 77
know? 0 52 77
And, 0 52 77
like, 0 52 77

it 0 52 78
depends 0 52 78
on 0 52 78
the 0 52 78
type 0 52 78
of 0 52 78
sin, 0 52 78
right? 0 52 78
“Spirit’s 0 52 78
sins” 0 52 78
like 0 52 78
spiritual 0 52 78
pride 0 52 78
and 0 52 78
avarice 0 52 78
and 0 52 78
stuff, 0 52 78
are 0 52 78
worse 0 52 78

than 0 52 79
“sins 0 52 79
of 0 52 79
the 0 52 79
flesh,” 0 52 79
you 0 52 79
know? 0 52 79
Which 0 52 79
are, 0 52 79
like, 0 52 79
only 0 52 79

a 0 52 80
result 0 52 80
of 0 52 80
“human 0 52 80
weakness,” 0 52 80
right? 0 52 80
Apparently 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
real 0 52 80
problem 0 52 80
with 0 52 80
this 0 52 80
whole 0 52 80
thing 0 52 80
has 0 52 80
been 0 52 80
that 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
Kasperian 0 52 80
kerfuffle 0 52 80
has 0 52 80
totally 0 52 80
been 0 52 80
blown 0 52 80
way, 0 52 80
way, 0 52 80
WAY 0 52 80
out 0 52 80
of 0 52 80
proportion, 0 52 80
and 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
“polarization” 0 52 80

it 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
caused 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
been 0 52 81
“regrettable”. 0 52 81
The 0 52 81
question 0 52 81
of 0 52 81
Communion 0 52 81
for 0 52 81
divorced 0 52 81
and 0 52 81
civilly 0 52 81
“remarried” 0 52 81
Catholics, 0 52 81
he 0 52 81
said, 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
been 0 52 81

Muller, 0 52 83
with 0 52 83
little 0 52 83
backing 0 52 83
from 0 52 83
Pope 0 52 83

with 0 52 83
outright 0 52 83
opposition 0 52 83
from 0 52 83

did 0 52 84
indeed 0 52 84
strive 0 52 84
to 0 52 84
hold 0 52 84
the 0 52 84
line. 0 52 84
The 0 52 84
fact 0 52 84
that 0 52 84

certainly 0 52 85
not 0 52 85
his 0 52 85
fault. 0 52 85
And 0 52 85
it 0 52 85
is 0 52 85
difficult 0 52 85
to 0 52 85
imagine 0 52 85
anyone 0 52 85

at 0 52 86
the 0 52 86
time. 0 52 86
But 0 52 86
since 0 52 86
then, 0 52 86
Muller 0 52 86
has 0 52 86
demonstrated 0 52 86
very 0 52 86
little 0 52 86
of 0 52 86
his 0 52 86
former 0 52 86

both 0 52 87
sides. 0 52 87
Reportedly 0 52 87
removed 0 52 87
from 0 52 87

– 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
of 0 52 87
course 0 52 87
lionized 1 52 87
by 0 52 87
“conservatives” 0 52 87
– 0 52 87
for 0 52 87
his 0 52 87
mild 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
equivocating 0 52 87
opposition 0 52 87
to 0 52 87

Laetitia, 0 52 87
Muller 0 52 87
has 0 52 87
gone 0 52 87
back 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
forth 0 52 87
in 0 52 87
what 0 52 87
can 0 52 87
easily 0 52 87
be 0 52 87
seen 0 52 87
as 0 52 87
a 0 52 87
desperate 0 52 87

to 0 52 88
find 0 52 88
friends 0 52 88
in 0 52 88
both 0 52 88
camps. 0 52 88
With 0 52 88
this 0 52 88
in 0 52 88
mind 0 52 88
one 0 52 88
could 0 52 88
be 0 52 88
forgiven 0 52 88
for 0 52 88
not 0 52 88
taking 0 52 88

his 0 52 89
October 0 52 89

seriously. 0 52 89

As 0 52 91
my 0 52 91

maybe 0 52 91
“it’s 0 52 91

In 0 52 95
this 0 52 95
interview, 0 52 95
Fr. 0 52 95
Weinandy 0 52 95
gave 0 52 95
a 0 52 95
remarkable 0 52 95
story 0 52 95
of 0 52 95
how 0 52 95
his 0 52 95
prayer 0 52 95
for 0 52 95
a 0 52 95
“sign” 0 52 95
that 0 52 95
he 0 52 95
ought 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
write 0 52 95
the 0 52 95
letter 0 52 95
was 0 52 95
very 0 52 95
specifically 0 52 95
answered: 0 52 95
“If 0 52 95
you 0 52 95
want 0 52 95
me 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
write 0 52 95
something, 0 52 95
you 0 52 95
have 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
give 0 52 95

me 0 52 96
a 0 52 96
clear 0 52 96
sign,” 0 52 96
Weinandy 0 52 96
recalls 0 52 96
saying. 0 52 96
“Tomorrow 0 52 96
morning, 0 52 96
I’m 0 52 96
going 0 52 96
to 0 52 96
Saint 0 52 96
Mary 0 52 96
Major’s 0 52 96
to 0 52 96
pray, 0 52 96

and 0 52 97
then 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
am 0 52 97
going 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
Saint 0 52 97
John 0 52 97
Lateran. 0 52 97
After 0 52 97
that, 0 52 97
I’m 0 52 97
coming 0 52 97
back 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
Saint 0 52 97
Peter’s 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
have 0 52 97
lunch 0 52 97
with 0 52 97
a 0 52 97
seminary 0 52 97
friend 0 52 97
of 0 52 97
mine.” 0 52 97
“During 0 52 97
that 0 52 97
interval, 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
must 0 52 97
meet 0 52 97
someone 0 52 97
that 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
know 0 52 97
but 0 52 97
have 0 52 97
not 0 52 97
seen 0 52 97
in 0 52 97
a 0 52 97
very 0 52 97
long 0 52 97
time, 0 52 97
and 0 52 97
would 0 52 97

never 0 52 98
expect 0 52 98
to 0 52 98
see 0 52 98
in 0 52 98
Rome 0 52 98
at 0 52 98
this 0 52 98
time. 0 52 98
That 0 52 98
person 0 52 98
cannot 0 52 98
be 0 52 98
from 0 52 98

the 0 52 99
United 0 52 99
States, 0 52 99
Canada 0 52 99
or 0 52 99
Great 0 52 99
Britain. 0 52 99
Moreover, 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
person 0 52 99
has 0 52 99
to 0 52 99
say 0 52 99
to 0 52 99
me, 0 52 99
‘Keep 0 52 99
up 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
good 0 52 99
writing’.” 0 52 99
Weinandy 0 52 99
said, 0 52 99
exactly 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
happened 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
next 0 52 99
day, 0 52 99
in 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
chance 0 52 99
meeting 0 52 99
with 0 52 99
an 0 52 99
archbishop 0 52 99
he’d 0 52 99
known 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
long 0 52 99
time 0 52 99
ago 0 52 99
but 0 52 99
not 0 52 99
seen 0 52 99
for 0 52 99
over 0 52 99
twenty 0 52 99
years, 0 52 99
who 0 52 99
congratulated 0 52 99
him 0 52 99
for 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
book 0 52 99
on 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
Incarnation 0 52 99
and 0 52 99
then 0 52 99
said 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
right 0 52 99
words, 0 52 99
“Keep 0 52 99
up 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
good 0 52 99
writing.” 0 52 99
“There 0 52 99
was 0 52 99
no 0 52 99
longer 0 52 99
any 0 52 99
doubt 0 52 99
in 0 52 99
my 0 52 99
mind 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
Jesus 0 52 99
wanted 0 52 99

me 0 52 99

to 0 52 99

write 0 52 99

something,” 0 52 99

Weinandy 0 52 99

said. 0 52 99

[2] 0 52 99

It’s 0 52 99

notable 0 52 99

that 0 52 99

these 0 52 99

howling 1 52 99

tantrums 1 52 99

from 0 52 99

the 0 52 99

German 0 52 99

bishops 0 52 99

halted 0 52 99

abruptly 0 52 99

about 0 52 99

the 0 52 99

same 0 52 99

time 0 52 99

as 0 52 99

CIA 0 54 0

Whatever 0 54 1
else 0 54 1
might 0 54 1
be 0 54 1
said 0 54 1
about 0 54 1
the 0 54 1
assassination 0 54 1
of 0 54 1
President 0 54 1
Kennedy, 0 54 1
one 0 54 1
thing 0 54 1
is 0 54 1
for 0 54 1
sure: 0 54 1
The 1 54 1
cover-up 1 54 1
of 1 54 1
this 1 54 1
particular 1 54 1
U.S. 1 54 1
regime-change 1 54 1
operation 1 54 1
was 0 54 1
one 1 54 1
of 1 54 1
the 1 54 1
most 1 54 1
ingenious 1 54 1
and 1 54 1
cunning 1 54 1
plots 1 54 1
ever 1 54 1
designed. 1 54 1

This 0 54 2
shouldn’t 0 54 2
surprise 0 54 2
anyone, 0 54 2
given 0 54 2
that 0 54 2
practically 0 54 2
from 0 54 2
its 0 54 2
inception 0 54 2
in 0 54 2
1947 0 54 2
the 0 54 2
CIA 0 54 2
was 0 54 2
specializing 0 54 2
in 0 54 2
the 0 54 2
arts 0 54 2
of 0 54 2
assassination, 0 54 2
regime 0 54 2
change, 0 54 2
and 0 54 2
cover-up. 0 54 2

As 0 54 3
far 0 54 3
back 0 54 3
as 0 54 3
1953, 0 54 3
the 0 54 3
CIA 0 54 3
published 0 54 3
an 0 54 3
assassination 0 54 3
manual 0 54 3
that 0 54 3
the 1 54 3
CIA 1 54 3
succeeded 1 54 3
in 1 54 3
keeping 1 54 3
secret 1 54 3
from 1 54 3
the 1 54 3
American 1 54 3
people 1 54 3
for 0 54 3
more 0 54 3
than 0 54 3
40 0 54 3
years. 0 54 3

It 0 54 4
came 0 54 4
to 0 54 4
light 0 54 4
in 0 54 4
1997 0 54 4
as 0 54 4
a 0 54 4
result 0 54 4
of 0 54 4
a 0 54 4
Freedom 0 54 4
of 0 54 4
Information 0 54 4
request. 0 54 4

That 0 54 5
was 0 54 5
around 0 54 5
the 0 54 5
time 0 54 5
that 0 54 5
the 0 54 5
Assassination 0 54 5
Records 0 54 5
Review 0 54 5
Board, 0 54 5
which 0 54 5
was 0 54 5
overseeing 0 54 5
the 0 54 5
mandatory 0 54 5
release 0 54 5
of 0 54 5
JFK-related 0 54 5
assassination 0 54 5
records 0 54 5
of 0 54 5
the 0 54 5
CIA 0 54 5
and 0 54 5
other 0 54 5
federal 0 54 5
agencies 0 54 5
that 0 54 5
had 0 54 5
been 0 54 5
kept 1 54 5
secret 1 54 5
from 1 54 5
the 1 54 5
American 1 54 5
people 1 54 5
since 1 54 5
1963. 1 54 5

Today, 0 54 6

can 0 54 6

online. 0 54 6

Titled 0 54 7
“Study 0 54 7
of 0 54 7
Assassination,” 0 54 7
the 0 54 7
manual 0 54 7
spells 0 54 7
out 0 54 7
various 0 54 7
ways 0 54 7
to 0 54 7
assassinate 0 54 7
people. 0 54 7

Here 0 54 8
is 0 54 8
what 0 54 8
the 0 54 8

states 0 54 8
in 0 54 8

regarding 0 54 8
the 0 54 8
use 0 54 8
of 0 54 8

Firearms 0 54 9
are 0 54 9
often 0 54 9
used 0 54 9
in 0 54 9
assassination, 0 54 9

very 0 54 9
ineffectively…. 0 54 9

the 0 54 14
following 0 54 14
excerpt: 0 54 14

For 0 54 15
secret 0 54 15
assassination, 0 54 15
either 0 54 15
simple 0 54 15
or 0 54 15
chase, 0 54 15
the 0 54 15
contrived 0 54 15
accident 0 54 15
is 0 54 15
the 0 54 15
most 0 54 15
effective 0 54 15
technique. 0 54 15

When 0 54 16
successfully 0 54 16
executed, 0 54 16
it 0 54 16
causes 0 54 16
little 0 54 16
excitement 0 54 16
and 0 54 16
is 0 54 16
only 0 54 16
casually 0 54 16
investigated. 0 54 16

It 0 54 17
would 0 54 17
be 0 54 17
safe 0 54 17
to 0 54 17
assume 0 54 17
that 0 54 17
the 0 54 17
CIA 0 54 17
continued 0 54 17
developing 0 54 17
and 0 54 17
expanding 0 54 17
on 0 54 17
the 0 54 17
assassination 0 54 17
principles 0 54 17
enunciated 0 54 17
in 0 54 17
that 0 54 17
early 0 54 17
assassination 0 54 17
manual. 0 54 17

That’s 0 54 18
what 0 54 18
we 0 54 18
would 0 54 18
expect 0 54 18
from 0 54 18
an 0 54 18
agency 0 54 18
whose 0 54 18
specialties 0 54 18
included 0 54 18
assassination. 0 54 18

We 0 54 19
can 0 54 19
also 0 54 19
assume 0 54 19
that 0 54 19
the 0 54 19
CIA 0 54 19
continued 0 54 19
to 0 54 19
refine 0 54 19
the 0 54 19
ways 0 54 19
to 0 54 19
avoid 0 54 19

The 0 54 21
CIA 0 54 21
published 0 54 21
that 0 54 21
secret 0 54 21
assassination 0 54 21
manual 0 54 21
as 0 54 21
part 0 54 21
of 0 54 21
its 0 54 21
preparations 0 54 21
for 0 54 21
a 0 54 21
U.S. 0 54 21
regime-change 0 54 21
operation 0 54 21
in 0 54 21
Guatemala, 0 54 21
one 0 54 21
that 0 54 21
was 0 54 21
designed 0 54 21
to 0 54 21
violently 1 54 21
remove 1 54 21
the 0 54 21
nation’s 0 54 21
democratically 0 54 21
elected 0 54 21
socialist 0 54 21
president, 0 54 21
Jacobo 0 54 21
Arbenz, 0 54 21
from 0 54 21
office 0 54 21
and 0 54 21
replace 0 54 21
him 0 54 21
with 0 54 21
an 0 54 21
unelected, 1 54 21
right-wing, 1 54 21
pro-U.S. 1 54 21
military 1 54 21
general. 1 54 21

As 0 54 22
part 0 54 22
of 0 54 22
the 0 54 22
Guatemala 0 54 22
regime-change 0 54 22
operation, 0 54 22
the 0 54 22
CIA 0 54 22
prepared 0 54 22
a 0 54 22
list 0 54 22
of 0 54 22
Guatemalan 0 54 22
officials 0 54 22
to 0 54 22
be 0 54 22
assassinated. 0 54 22

While 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
CIA 0 54 23
has 0 54 23
never 0 54 23
revealed 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
names 0 54 23
of 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
people 0 54 23
it 0 54 23
targeted 0 54 23
for 0 54 23
assassination, 0 54 23
there 0 54 23
is 0 54 23
little 0 54 23
doubt 0 54 23
that 0 54 23
Arbenz, 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
president, 0 54 23
was 0 54 23
at 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
top 0 54 23
of 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
list. 0 54 23

There 0 54 24
is 0 54 24
something 0 54 24
important 0 54 24
to 0 54 24
note: 0 54 24
Neither 0 54 24
Arbenz 0 54 24
nor 0 54 24
any 0 54 24
other 0 54 24
Guatemalan 0 54 24
official 0 54 24
had 0 54 24
ever 0 54 24
attacked 0 54 24
the 0 54 24
United 0 54 24
States 0 54 24
or 0 54 24
even 0 54 24
threatened 0 54 24
to 0 54 24
do 0 54 24
so. 0 54 24

So, 0 54 25
why 0 54 25
were 0 54 25
they 0 54 25
targeted 0 54 25
for 0 54 25
assassination? 0 54 25

Because 0 54 26
Arbenz 0 54 26
had 0 54 26
reached 0 54 26
out 0 54 26
to 0 54 26
the 0 54 26
Russians 0 54 26
and 0 54 26
Cubans 0 54 26
in 0 54 26
a 0 54 26
spirit 0 54 26
of 0 54 26
peace 0 54 26
and 0 54 26
friendship, 0 54 26
just 0 54 26
as 0 54 26
John 0 54 26
Kennedy 0 54 26
would 0 54 26
do 0 54 26
ten 0 54 26
years 0 54 26
later. 0 54 26

That’s 0 54 27
why 0 54 27
the 0 54 27
CIA 0 54 27
targeted 0 54 27
Guatemala 0 54 27
for 0 54 27
regime 0 54 27
change 0 54 27
and 0 54 27
why 0 54 27
it 0 54 27
targeted 0 54 27
Arbenz 0 54 27
and 0 54 27
other 0 54 27
Guatemalan 0 54 27
officials 0 54 27
for 0 54 27
assassination. 0 54 27

Although 0 54 28
Arbenz 0 54 28
was 0 54 28
able 0 54 28
to 0 54 28
escape 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
country, 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
CIA’s 0 54 28
regime-change 0 54 28
operation 0 54 28
was 0 54 28
a 1 54 28
total 1 54 28
success, 1 54 28
with 0 54 28
Arbenz 0 54 28
being 0 54 28
replaced 0 54 28
by 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
pro-U.S. 0 54 28
Gen. 0 54 28
Carlos 0 54 28
Castillo 0 54 28
Armas, 0 54 28
who 0 54 28
proceeded 0 54 28
to 0 54 28
instigate 0 54 28
a 1 54 28
reign 1 54 28
of 1 54 28
terror 1 54 28
across 0 54 28
Guatemala. 0 54 28

The 1 54 29
Guatemalan 1 54 29
operation 1 54 29
was 1 54 29
brilliant 1 54 29
and 1 54 29
ingenious. 1 54 29

The 0 54 30
CIA 0 54 30
officials 0 54 30
were 0 54 30
secretly 0 54 30
honored 0 54 30
for 0 54 30
protecting 0 54 30
“national 0 54 30
security” 0 54 30
by 0 54 30
removing 0 54 30
President 0 54 30
Arbenz 0 54 30
from 0 54 30
office 0 54 30
and 0 54 30
replacing 0 54 30
him 0 54 30
with 0 54 30
a 0 54 30
pro-U.S. 0 54 30
military 0 54 30
general. 0 54 30

Tracy 0 54 31
Barnes, 0 54 31
one 0 54 31
of 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
CIA 0 54 31
officials 0 54 31
responsible 0 54 31
for 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
operation, 0 54 31
was 0 54 31
awarded 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
Distinguished 0 54 31
Intelligence 0 54 31
Medal, 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
CIA’s 0 54 31
second-highest 0 54 31
medal. 0 54 31

The 1 54 32
CIA’s 1 54 32
cover-up 1 54 32
in 1 54 32
the 1 54 32
JFK 1 54 32
assassination 1 54 32
was 1 54 32
even 1 54 32
more 1 54 32
brilliant 1 54 32
and 1 54 32
ingenious. 1 54 32

The 0 54 33
doctors 0 54 33
at 0 54 33
Parkland 0 54 33
Hospital 0 54 33
stated 0 54 33
that 0 54 33
President 0 54 33
Kennedy 0 54 33
had 0 54 33
a 0 54 33
big 0 54 33
exit-sized 0 54 33
wound 0 54 33
in 0 54 33
the 0 54 33
back 0 54 33
of 0 54 33
his 0 54 33
head, 0 54 33
which 0 54 33
implied 0 54 33
a 0 54 33
shot 0 54 33
having 0 54 33
been 0 54 33
fired 0 54 33
from 0 54 33
the 0 54 33
front. 0 54 33

At 0 54 34
a 0 54 34
press 0 54 34
conference 0 54 34
immediately 0 54 34
after 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
president 0 54 34
died, 0 54 34
two 0 54 34
treating 0 54 34
physicians 0 54 34
stated 0 54 34
that 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
other 0 54 34
wound 0 54 34
— 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
one 0 54 34
in 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
front 0 54 34
of 0 54 34
Kennedy’s 0 54 34
neck 0 54 34
— 0 54 34
was 0 54 34
an 0 54 34
entry 0 54 34
wound, 0 54 34
which 0 54 34
implied 0 54 34
that 0 54 34
Kennedy 0 54 34
had 0 54 34
been 0 54 34
hit 0 54 34
by 0 54 34
another 0 54 34
shot 0 54 34
fired 0 54 34
from 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
front. 0 54 34

This 0 54 35
necessarily 0 54 35
meant 0 54 35
that 0 54 35
Kennedy 0 54 35
had 0 54 35
been 0 54 35
shot 0 54 35
from 0 54 35
the 0 54 35
front, 0 54 35
not 0 54 35
the 0 54 35
rear, 0 54 35
where 0 54 35
accused 0 54 35
assassin 0 54 35
Lee 0 54 35
Harvey 0 54 35
Oswald 0 54 35
was 0 54 35
situated. 0 54 35

Keep 0 54 36
in 0 54 36
mind 0 54 36
something 0 54 36
important: 0 54 36
After 0 54 36
he 0 54 36
was 0 54 36
arrested, 0 54 36
Oswald 0 54 36
claimed 0 54 36
his 0 54 36
innocence. 0 54 36

But 0 54 37
he 0 54 37
also 0 54 37
went 0 54 37
a 0 54 37
step 0 54 37
further. 0 54 37

He 0 54 38
said 0 54 38
that 0 54 38
he 0 54 38
was 0 54 38
being 0 54 38
framed 0 54 38
for 0 54 38
the 0 54 38
crime. 0 54 38

The 0 54 39
obvious 0 54 39
question 0 54 39
arises: 0 54 39
Why 0 54 39
frame 0 54 39
an 0 54 39
innocent 0 54 39
man 0 54 39
who 0 54 39
is 0 54 39
situated 0 54 39
in 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
rear 0 54 39
by 0 54 39
killing 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
president 0 54 39
with 0 54 39
shots 0 54 39
fired 0 54 39
from 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
front? 0 54 39

Wouldn’t 0 54 40
it 0 54 40
be 0 54 40
more 0 54 40
logical 0 54 40
to 0 54 40
either 0 54 40
have 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
shots 0 54 40
fired 0 54 40
from 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
rear, 0 54 40
where 0 54 40
Oswald 0 54 40
was, 0 54 40
or, 0 54 40
alternatively, 0 54 40
place 0 54 40
Oswald 0 54 40
in 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
front, 0 54 40
where 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
shots 0 54 40
were 0 54 40
fired? 0 54 40

That’s 0 54 41
where 0 54 41
the 1 54 41
brilliance, 1 54 41
ingenuity, 1 54 41
and 1 54 41
cunningness 1 54 41
of 1 54 41
the 1 54 41
cover-up 1 54 41
come 0 54 41
into 0 54 41
play. 0 54 41

If 0 54 42
Oswald 0 54 42
is 0 54 42
in 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
rear 0 54 42
and 0 54 42
since 0 54 42
shots 0 54 42
are 0 54 42
fired 0 54 42
from 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
front, 0 54 42
that 0 54 42
could 0 54 42
mean 0 54 42
only 0 54 42
one 0 54 42
thing: 0 54 42
that 0 54 42
Oswald 0 54 42
had 0 54 42
confederates 0 54 42
firing 0 54 42
from 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
front. 0 54 42

Who 0 54 43
would 0 54 43
those 0 54 43
confederates 0 54 43
be? 0 54 43

There 1 54 44
could 1 54 44
be 1 54 44
only 1 54 44
one 1 54 44
answer: 1 54 44
communists. 1 54 44

Soviet 1 54 45
and 1 54 45
Cuban 1 54 45
communists, 1 54 45
to 1 54 45
be 1 54 45
more 1 54 45
specific. 1 54 45

How 0 54 46
would 0 54 46
we 0 54 46
know 0 54 46
this? 0 54 46

That’s 0 54 47
where 0 54 47
Oswald’s 0 54 47
trip 0 54 47
to 0 54 47
Mexico 0 54 47
City 0 54 47
right 0 54 47
before 0 54 47

Oswald 0 54 49
traveled 0 54 49
to 0 54 49
Mexico 0 54 49
City 0 54 49
where 0 54 49
he 0 54 49
purportedly 0 54 49
visited 0 54 49
the 0 54 49
Soviet 0 54 49

Keep 0 54 50
in 0 54 50

that 0 54 50
this 0 54 50
was 0 54 50

that 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
Cuban 0 54 50
Missile 0 54 50
Crisis, 0 54 50
which 0 54 50
brought 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
world 0 54 50
to 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
brink 0 54 50
of 0 54 50
nuclear 0 54 50
war, 0 54 50
had 0 54 50
taken 0 54 50
place 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
previous 0 54 50
year. 0 54 50

So, 0 54 51
President 0 54 51
Kennedy 0 54 51
has 0 54 51
been 0 54 51
assassinated. 0 54 51

Oswald 0 54 52
is 0 54 52
immediately 0 54 52
arrested. 0 54 52

He 0 54 53
has 0 54 53
confederates 0 54 53
firing 0 54 53
from 0 54 53
the 0 54 53
front, 0 54 53
who 1 54 53
almost 1 54 53
certainly 1 54 53
are 1 54 53
Soviet 1 54 53
and 1 54 53
Cuban 1 54 53
communists, 1 54 53
especially 0 54 53
since 0 54 53
Oswald 0 54 53
has 0 54 53
supposedly 0 54 53
just 0 54 53
recently 0 54 53
visited 0 54 53
the 0 54 53
Soviet 0 54 53
and 0 54 53
Cuban 0 54 53
embassies 0 54 53
in 0 54 53
Mexico 0 54 53
City. 0 54 53

What 0 54 54
does 0 54 54
all 0 54 54
that 0 54 54
mean? 0 54 54

An 0 54 55
assassination 0 54 55
of 0 54 55
the 0 54 55
president 0 54 55
by 0 54 55
the 0 54 55
Soviet 0 54 55
Union 0 54 55
and 0 54 55
Cuba 0 54 55
is 0 54 55
obviously 0 54 55
an 0 54 55
act 0 54 55
of 0 54 55
war. 0 54 55

That 0 54 56
means 0 54 56
nuclear 0 54 56
war 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
about 0 54 56
to 0 54 56
break 0 54 56
out 0 54 56
because 0 54 56
there 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
no 0 54 56
way 0 54 56
that 0 54 56
the 0 54 56
United 0 54 56
States 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
going 0 54 56
to 0 54 56
sit 0 54 56
idly 0 54 56
by 0 54 56
when 0 54 56
the 1 54 56
Reds 1 54 56
have 0 54 56
just 0 54 56
assassinated 0 54 56
America’s 0 54 56
president. 0 54 56

Except 0 54 57
for 0 54 57
one 0 54 57
thing: 0 54 57
The 1 54 57
communist 1 54 57
part 1 54 57
and 1 54 57
the 1 54 57
nuclear-war 1 54 57
part 1 54 57
were 1 54 57
concocted. 1 54 57

That 1 54 58
was 1 54 58
all 1 54 58
part 1 54 58
of 1 54 58
the 1 54 58
plan. 1 54 58

That 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
the 1 54 59
ingenious 1 54 59
way 1 54 59
that 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
CIA 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
able 0 54 59
to 0 54 59
get 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
investigation 0 54 59
into 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
assassination 0 54 59
squelched 0 54 59
just 0 54 59
as 0 54 59
soon 0 54 59
as 0 54 59
Oswald 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
murdered. 0 54 59

In 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
early 0 54 60
days 0 54 60
of 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
Warren 0 54 60
Commission, 0 54 60
commission 0 54 60
chairman 0 54 60
Earl 0 54 60
Warren 0 54 60
called 0 54 60
a 0 54 60
top-secret 0 54 60
meeting 0 54 60
of 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
commission. 0 54 60

Its 0 54 61
purpose 0 54 61
was 0 54 61
to 0 54 61
discuss 0 54 61
information 0 54 61
that 0 54 61
Warren 0 54 61
had 0 54 61
received 0 54 61
that 0 54 61
Oswald 0 54 61
was 0 54 61
actually 0 54 61
a 0 54 61
U.S. 0 54 61
intelligence 0 54 61
agent 0 54 61
or 0 54 61
an 0 54 61
informant 0 54 61
for 0 54 61
the 0 54 61
FBI 0 54 61
or 0 54 61
both. 0 54 61

How 0 54 62
did 0 54 62
Warren 0 54 62
resolve 0 54 62
this 0 54 62
troubling 0 54 62
issue? 0 54 62

He 0 54 63
simply 0 54 63
asked 0 54 63
the 0 54 63
heads 0 54 63
of 0 54 63
the 0 54 63
CIA 0 54 63
and 0 54 63
FBI 0 54 63
whether 0 54 63
it 0 54 63
was 0 54 63
true. 0 54 63

They 0 54 64
said 0 54 64
no. 0 54 64

That 0 54 65
was 0 54 65
the 0 54 65
end 0 54 65
of 0 54 65
the 0 54 65
matter. 0 54 65

The 0 54 66
issue 0 54 66
was 0 54 66
so 0 54 66
sensitive 0 54 66
that 0 54 66
Warren 0 54 66
ordered 0 54 66
the 0 54 66
members 0 54 66
of 0 54 66
the 0 54 66
commission 0 54 66
to 1 54 66
never 1 54 66
reveal 1 54 66
the 1 54 66
meeting 1 54 66
to 1 54 66
the 1 54 66
American 1 54 66
people. 1 54 66

He 0 54 67
ordered 0 54 67
all 0 54 67
notes 0 54 67
and 0 54 67
other 0 54 67
written 0 54 67
references 0 54 67
to 0 54 67
be 0 54 67
destroyed. 0 54 67

He 0 54 68
also 0 54 68
ordered 0 54 68
the 0 54 68
court 0 54 68
reporter 0 54 68
to 0 54 68
destroy 0 54 68
her 0 54 68
notes 0 54 68
of 0 54 68
the 0 54 68
meeting. 0 54 68

Unbeknownst 0 54 69
to 0 54 69
him, 0 54 69
the 0 54 69
court 0 54 69
reporter 0 54 69
inadvertently 0 54 69
kept 0 54 69
a 0 54 69
recording 0 54 69
of 0 54 69
the 0 54 69
meeting 0 54 69
that 0 54 69
ultimately 0 54 69
came 0 54 69
to 0 54 69
light. 0 54 69

This 0 54 70
troubling 0 54 70
issue 0 54 70
arose 0 54 70
again 0 54 70
yesterday, 0 54 70
November 0 54 70
2, 0 54 70
in 0 54 70

BELIN: 0 54 71
Well, 0 54 71
now, 0 54 71
the 0 54 71
final 0 54 71
area 0 54 71
of 0 54 71
my 0 54 71
interrogation 0 54 71
relates 0 54 71
to 0 54 71
charges 0 54 71
that 0 54 71
the 0 54 71
CIA 0 54 71
was 0 54 71
in 0 54 71
some 0 54 71
way 0 54 71
conspiratorially 0 54 71

with 0 54 71
the 0 54 71
assassination 0 54 71
of 0 54 71
President 0 54 71

the 0 54 72

is 0 54 72
that 0 54 72
correct? 0 54 72

HELMS: 0 54 73
I 0 54 73
believe 0 54 73
so. 0 54 73

BELIN: 0 54 74

there 0 54 74
any 0 54 74

That’s 0 54 75
where 0 54 75
the 0 54 75
transcript 0 54 75
ends 0 54 75
according 0 54 75
to 0 54 75
few 0 54 75
secret 0 54 75
records 0 54 75

Shapira 0 54 76
points 0 54 76
out, 0 54 76
“Several 0 54 76

government’s 0 54 76
continued 0 54 76
secrecy 0 54 76
about 0 54 76
the 0 54 76
assassination.” 0 54 76
Shapira 0 54 76
points 0 54 76
out 0 54 76
that 0 54 76
Helms’ 0 54 76
full 0 54 76
deposition 0 54 76
has 0 54 76
been 0 54 76
in 0 54 76
the 0 54 76
public 0 54 76
arena 0 54 76
since 0 54 76
1994. 0 54 76

(The 0 54 77
year 0 54 77
1994 0 54 77
was 0 54 77
during 0 54 77
the 0 54 77

been 0 54 78
formed 0 54 78
after 0 54 78

posited 0 54 78
that 0 54 78

Shapira 0 54 79
then 0 54 79
proceeds 0 54 79
to 0 54 79
provide 0 54 79
the 0 54 79
answer 0 54 79
that 0 54 79
Helms 0 54 79
gave, 0 54 79
which, 0 54 79
as 0 54 79
he 0 54 79
points 0 54 79
out, 0 54 79
has 0 54 79
been 0 54 79
public: 0 54 79

HELMS: 0 54 80
Mr. 0 54 80
Belin, 0 54 80
this 0 54 80
question, 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
I 0 54 80
think 0 54 80
you 0 54 80
may 0 54 80
recall 0 54 80
this, 0 54 80
was 0 54 80
raised 0 54 80
at 0 54 80
the 0 54 80
time 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
the 0 54 80
Agency 0 54 80
was 0 54 80
never 0 54 80
able 0 54 80
to 0 54 80
find 0 54 80
any 0 54 80
evidence 0 54 80
whatsoever, 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
we 0 54 80
really 0 54 80
searched 0 54 80
that 0 54 80
it 0 54 80
had 0 54 80
any 0 54 80
contact 0 54 80
with 0 54 80
Lee 0 54 80
Harvey 0 54 80
Oswald. 0 54 80

As 0 54 81
far 0 54 81
as 0 54 81
the 0 54 81
FBI 0 54 81
was 0 54 81
concerned, 0 54 81
my 0 54 81
recollection 0 54 81
is 0 54 81
not 0 54 81
all 0 54 81
that 0 54 81
precise. 0 54 81

I 0 54 82
believe 0 54 82
that 0 54 82
Mr. 0 54 82
Hoover 0 54 82
testified 0 54 82
that 0 54 82
he 0 54 82
had 0 54 82
not 0 54 82
been 0 54 82
an 0 54 82
agent 0 54 82
of 0 54 82
theirs 0 54 82
either. 0 54 82

He 0 54 83
was 0 54 83
certainly 0 54 83
not 0 54 83
an 0 54 83
agent 0 54 83
of 0 54 83
the 0 54 83
CIA. 0 54 83

He 0 54 84
was 0 54 84
certainly 0 54 84
never 0 54 84
used 0 54 84
by 0 54 84
the 0 54 84
CIA. 0 54 84

Whether 0 54 85
any 0 54 85
CIA 0 54 85
officer 0 54 85
ever 0 54 85
talked 0 54 85
to 0 54 85
him 0 54 85
any 0 54 85
place 0 54 85
or 0 54 85
not 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
don’t 0 54 85
know 0 54 85
but 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
certainly 0 54 85
felt 0 54 85
quite 0 54 85
comfortable 0 54 85
— 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
believe 0 54 85
Mr. 0 54 85
[John] 0 54 85
McCone 0 54 85
[a 0 54 85
previous 0 54 85
CIA 0 54 85
director] 0 54 85
was 0 54 85
asked 0 54 85
to 0 54 85
testify 0 54 85
before 0 54 85
the 0 54 85
Commission 0 54 85
on 0 54 85
this 0 54 85
point. 0 54 85

I 0 54 86
believe 0 54 86
he 0 54 86
was 0 54 86
asked 0 54 86
to 0 54 86
testify. 0 54 86

It 0 54 87
was 0 54 87
a 0 54 87
hot 0 54 87
item 0 54 87
anyway 0 54 87
at 0 54 87
the 0 54 87
time. 0 54 87

And 0 54 88
my 0 54 88
recollection 0 54 88
is 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
I 0 54 88
informed 0 54 88
Mr. 0 54 88
McCone 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
we 0 54 88
could 0 54 88
find 0 54 88
no 0 54 88
evidence 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
Oswald 0 54 88
had 0 54 88
any 0 54 88
connection 0 54 88
with 0 54 88
the 0 54 88
CIA. 0 54 88

Shapira 0 54 89
ends 0 54 89
his 0 54 89
article 0 54 89
by 0 54 89
suggesting 0 54 89
that 0 54 89
commentators 1 54 89
should 1 54 89
do 1 54 89
more 1 54 89
complete 1 54 89
research, 1 54 89
maybe 1 54 89
even 1 54 89
use 1 54 89
Google, 1 54 89
before 1 54 89
they 1 54 89
jump 1 54 89
to 1 54 89
conclusions. 1 54 89

But 1 54 90
Shapira 1 54 90
would 1 54 90
be 1 54 90
wise 1 54 90
to 1 54 90
follow 1 54 90
his 1 54 90
own 1 54 90
advice 1 54 90
because 1 54 90
he 1 54 90
himself 1 54 90
is 1 54 90
guilty 1 54 90
of 1 54 90
what 1 54 90
he 1 54 90
accuses 1 54 90
others 1 54 90
of. 1 54 90

That’s 0 54 91
because 0 54 91
he 1 54 91
failed 1 54 91
to 1 54 91
conclude 1 54 91
his 1 54 91
article 1 54 91
with 1 54 91
one 1 54 91
great 1 54 91
big 1 54 91

about 1 54 91

to 1 54 92

Perjury. 0 54 93

He 0 54 94
left 0 54 94
out 0 54 94
that 0 54 94
former 0 54 94
CIA 0 54 94

Richard 0 54 94

A 1 54 95
liar. 1 54 95

A 0 54 96
CIA 0 54 96
official 0 54 96
who 0 54 96
would 0 54 96
tell 0 54 96
falsehoods, 0 54 96
even 0 54 96
under 0 54 96
oath, 0 54 96
whenever 0 54 96
he 0 54 96
felt 0 54 96
that 0 54 96
“national 0 54 96
security” 0 54 96
required 0 54 96
it. 0 54 96

Shapira 1 54 97
failed 1 54 97
to 1 54 97
note 1 54 97
that 1 54 97
Helms 1 54 97
was 1 54 97
convicted 1 54 97
in 1 54 97
a 1 54 97
federal 1 54 97

Interesting 0 54 98
enough, 0 54 98
in 0 54 98
the 0 54 98
Chile 0 54 98

the 0 54 98
CIA 0 54 98

the 0 54 98

in 0 54 98
the 0 54 98
Chilean 0 54 98

duty 0 54 98
to 0 54 98

The 0 54 99

Thus, 0 54 102
given 0 54 102
that 0 54 102
Helms 0 54 102
was 0 54 102
an 0 54 102

what 0 54 102

for 0 54 104

in 0 54 104
his 0 54 104

The 0 54 105
circumstantial 0 54 105
evidence 0 54 105
overwhelmingly 1 54 105
establishes 0 54 105
that 0 54 105
Oswald 0 54 105
was 0 54 105
working 0 54 105
for 0 54 105
U.S. 0 54 105
intelligence. 0 54 105

How 0 54 106
often 0 54 106
have 0 54 106
you 0 54 106
ever 0 54 106
heard 0 54 106
of 0 54 106
a 0 54 106
U.S. 0 54 106
Marine 0 54 106
communist? 0 54 106

If 0 54 107
Oswald 0 54 107
was 0 54 107
a 0 54 107
genuine 0 54 107
communist, 0 54 107
why 0 54 107
would 0 54 107
he 0 54 107
have 0 54 107
joined 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Marines 0 54 107
in 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
1950s, 0 54 107
given 0 54 107
that 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Marines 0 54 107
hated 0 54 107
communists 0 54 107
and 0 54 107
had 0 54 107
just 0 54 107
helped 0 54 107
kill 0 54 107
millions 0 54 107
of 0 54 107
them 0 54 107
in 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Korean 0 54 107
War? 0 54 107

Why 0 54 108
would 0 54 108
a 0 54 108
genuine 0 54 108
communist 0 54 108
want 0 54 108
to 0 54 108
join 0 54 108
an 0 54 108
organization 0 54 108
in 0 54 108
which 0 54 108
he 0 54 108
could 0 54 108
be 0 54 108
ordered, 0 54 108
on 0 54 108
a 0 54 108
moment’s 0 54 108
notice, 0 54 108
to 0 54 108
return 0 54 108

Don’t 0 54 109
forget: 0 54 109
this 0 54 109
is 0 54 109
the 0 54 109
height 0 54 109
of 0 54 109
the 0 54 109
Cold 0 54 109
War! 0 54 109

After 0 54 110
Oswald 0 54 110
supposedly 0 54 110
tried 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
“defect” 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
Soviet 0 54 110
Union 0 54 110
and 0 54 110
promised 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
give 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
Russians 0 54 110
all 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
secrets 0 54 110
he 0 54 110
learned 0 54 110
about 0 54 110
in 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
military, 0 54 110
why 0 54 110
would 0 54 110
U.S. 0 54 110
officials 0 54 110
agree 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
let 0 54 110
him 0 54 110
back 0 54 110
in 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
country, 0 54 110
and 0 54 110
with 0 54 110
a 0 54 110
communist 1 54 110
wife? 1 54 110

Why 0 54 111
wouldn’t 0 54 111
they 0 54 111
indict 0 54 111
him 0 54 111
or 0 54 111
at 0 54 111
least 0 54 111
haul 0 54 111
him 0 54 111
before 0 54 111
a 0 54 111
federal 0 54 111
grand 0 54 111
jury 0 54 111
to 0 54 111
testify 0 54 111
as 0 54 111
to 0 54 111
what 0 54 111
secrets 0 54 111
he 0 54 111
gave 0 54 111
the 0 54 111
Russians? 0 54 111

Why 0 54 112
wouldn’t 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
harass, 1 54 112
abuse, 1 54 112
humiliate, 1 54 112
persecute, 1 54 112
or 1 54 112
prosecute 1 54 112
him, 1 54 112
like 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
did 0 54 112
to 0 54 112
Martin 0 54 112
Luther 0 54 112
King, 0 54 112

and 0 54 112
other 0 54 112
people 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
have 0 54 112
deemed 0 54 112
to 0 54 112
be 0 54 112
communists 0 54 112
or 0 54 112
traitors? 0 54 112

How 0 54 113
is 0 54 113
it 0 54 113
possible 0 54 113
that 0 54 113
Oswald 0 54 113
could 0 54 113
learn 0 54 113
fluent 0 54 113
Russian 0 54 113
while 0 54 113
serving 0 54 113
in 0 54 113
the 0 54 113
U.S. 0 54 113
military 0 54 113
without 0 54 113
having 0 54 113
U.S. 0 54 113
military 0 54 113
tutors 0 54 113
teaching 0 54 113
him? 0 54 113

How 0 54 114
is 0 54 114
it 0 54 114
possible 0 54 114
that 0 54 114
a 0 54 114
veteran 0 54 114
who 0 54 114
embarrasses 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
U.S. 0 54 114
Marine 0 54 114
Corps 0 54 114
by 0 54 114
openly 0 54 114
proselytizing 0 54 114
for 0 54 114
communism 0 54 114
in 0 54 114
New 0 54 114
Orleans 0 54 114
is 0 54 114
able 0 54 114
to 0 54 114
saunter 0 54 114
across 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
Cold 0 54 114
War 0 54 114
stage 0 54 114
of 0 54 114
history, 0 54 114
not 0 54 114
long 0 54 114
after 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
McCarthy 0 54 114
hearings, 0 54 114
without 1 54 114
nary 1 54 114
a 1 54 114
care 1 54 114
in 1 54 114
the 1 54 114
world? 1 54 114

The 1 54 115
answer: 1 54 115
Helms 1 54 115
lied. 1 54 115

There 1 54 116
is 1 54 116
no 1 54 116
reasonable 1 54 116
doubt 1 54 116
that 1 54 116
Oswald 1 54 116
was 1 54 116
a 1 54 116
U.S. 1 54 116
intelligence 1 54 116
agent, 1 54 116
one 0 54 116
who 0 54 116
was 0 54 116
ordered 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
travel 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
Mexico 0 54 116
City 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
set 0 54 116
the 0 54 116
framework 0 54 116
for 0 54 116
his 0 54 116
frame-up. 0 54 116

But 0 54 117
things 0 54 117
obviously 0 54 117
went 0 54 117
dreadfully 1 54 117
wrong 1 54 117
in 0 54 117
Mexico 0 54 117
City, 0 54 117
which 0 54 117
is 0 54 117
why 0 54 117
the 0 54 117
CIA 0 54 117
had 0 54 117
to 0 54 117
shut 0 54 117
down 0 54 117
that 0 54 117
part 0 54 117
of 0 54 117
the 0 54 117
post-assassination 0 54 117
investigation. 0 54 117

Not 0 54 118
surprisingly, 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
CIA’s 0 54 118
Mexico 0 54 118
City 0 54 118
operations 0 54 118
regarding 0 54 118
Oswald 0 54 118
are 0 54 118
among 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
98 0 54 118
percent 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
records 0 54 118
that 0 54 118
Trump 0 54 118
and 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
CIA 0 54 118
have 0 54 118
chosen 0 54 118
to 0 54 118
continue 0 54 118
keeping 1 54 118
secret 1 54 118
from 1 54 118
the 1 54 118
American 1 54 118
people, 1 54 118
on 0 54 118
grounds 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
“national 0 54 118
security” 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
course. 0 54 118

Thus, 0 54 119
when 1 54 119
Oswald 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
claiming 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
he 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
being 1 54 119
framed, 1 54 119
there 1 54 119
could 1 54 119
be 1 54 119
only 1 54 119
one 1 54 119
entity 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
he 1 54 119
could 1 54 119
have 1 54 119
been 1 54 119
thinking 1 54 119
about: 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
CIA, 1 54 119
the 0 54 119
agency 0 54 119
whose 0 54 119
officials, 0 54 119
as 0 54 119
former 0 54 119
Washington 0 54 119
Post 0 54 119
investigative 0 54 119
reporter 0 54 119
Jefferson 0 54 119
Morley 0 54 119
has 0 54 119
documented, 0 54 119
were 1 54 119
secretly 1 54 119
monitoring 1 54 119
his 1 54 119
activities 1 54 119
in 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
weeks 1 54 119
leading 1 54 119
up 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
assassination, 1 54 119
no 1 54 119
doubt 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
ensure 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
Oswald 1 54 119
had 1 54 119
not 1 54 119
figured 1 54 119
out 1 54 119
what 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
about 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
happen 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
him. 1 54 119

We 0 54 120
can 0 54 120
assume 0 54 120
that 0 54 120
any 0 54 120
frame-up 0 54 120
by 0 54 120
the 0 54 120
CIA 0 54 120
is 0 54 120
going 0 54 120
to 0 54 120
be 0 54 120
good. 0 54 120

The 0 54 121
operation 0 54 121
is 0 54 121
going 0 54 121
to 0 54 121
be 0 54 121
carefully 0 54 121
planned 0 54 121
and 0 54 121
executed. 0 54 121

But 1 54 122
no 1 54 122
plan 1 54 122
is 1 54 122
perfect. 1 54 122

Things 0 54 123
are 0 54 123
inevitably 0 54 123
going 0 54 123
to 0 54 123
go 0 54 123
wrong. 0 54 123

The 0 54 124
pieces 0 54 124
aren’t 0 54 124
going 0 54 124
to 0 54 124
fit 0 54 124
together 0 54 124
perfectly. 0 54 124

The 0 54 125
Mexico 0 54 125
City 0 54 125
operation 0 54 125
is 0 54 125
a 0 54 125
good 0 54 125
example 0 54 125
of 0 54 125
that. 0 54 125

That’s 1 54 126
why 1 54 126
the 1 54 126
CIA 1 54 126
has 1 54 126
to 1 54 126
continue 1 54 126
keeping 1 54 126
those 1 54 126
records 1 54 126
secret. 1 54 126

But 0 54 127
here’s 0 54 127
another 0 54 127
example, 0 54 127
a 0 54 127
small 0 54 127
but 0 54 127
important 0 54 127
one: 0 54 127
Recall 0 54 127
that 0 54 127
Oswald 0 54 127
supposedly 0 54 127
hid 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
rifle 0 54 127
before 0 54 127
he 0 54 127
headed 0 54 127
down 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
steps 0 54 127
from 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
sixth 0 54 127
floor 0 54 127
of 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
school 0 54 127
book 0 54 127
depository. 0 54 127

Ask 0 54 128
yourself: 0 54 128
If 0 54 128
someone 0 54 128
has 0 54 128
just 0 54 128
assassinated 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
president 0 54 128
of 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
United 0 54 128
States, 0 54 128
is 0 54 128
he 0 54 128
really 0 54 128
going 0 54 128
to 0 54 128
take 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
time 0 54 128
to 0 54 128
hide 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
rifle? 0 54 128

What 0 54 129
good 0 54 129
would 0 54 129
that 0 54 129
do? 0 54 129

Wouldn’t 0 54 130
officials 0 54 130
conduct 0 54 130
a 0 54 130
thorough 0 54 130
search 0 54 130
of 0 54 130
the 0 54 130
area? 0 54 130

Wouldn’t 0 54 131
an 0 54 131
assassin 0 54 131
instead 0 54 131
simply 0 54 131
leave 0 54 131
the 0 54 131
rifle 0 54 131
there 0 54 131
and 0 54 131
get 0 54 131
out 0 54 131
of 0 54 131
there 0 54 131
as 0 54 131
soon 0 54 131
as 0 54 131
he 0 54 131
could? 0 54 131

Then 1 54 132
why 1 54 132
the 1 54 132
hidden 1 54 132
rifle? 1 54 132

Because 1 54 133
it’s 1 54 133
consistent 1 54 133
with 1 54 133
a 1 54 133
frame-up. 1 54 133

The 0 54 134
framers 0 54 134
had 0 54 134
to 0 54 134
hide 0 54 134
the 0 54 134
rifle 0 54 134
in 0 54 134
advance 0 54 134
in 0 54 134
a 0 54 134
place 0 54 134
where 0 54 134
no 0 54 134
one 0 54 134
CIA 0 54 134
& 0 54 134
JFK: 0 54 134

Amazon 0 54 134

would 0 54 135
see 0 54 135
it 0 54 135
during 0 54 135
the 0 54 135
morning 0 54 135
of 0 54 135
the 0 54 135
assassination, 0 54 135
which 0 54 135
took 0 54 135
place 0 54 135
after 0 54 135
noon. 0 54 135

No 0 54 136
matter 0 54 136
how 0 54 136
good 0 54 136
a 0 54 136
frame-up 0 54 136
was, 0 54 136
the 0 54 136
CIA 0 54 136
knew 0 54 136
that 0 54 136
it 0 54 136
could 0 54 136
be 0 54 136
detected 0 54 136
with 0 54 136
an 0 54 136
aggressive 0 54 136
investigation. 0 54 136

That’s 0 54 137
where 0 54 137
ingenuity 1 54 137
and 1 54 137
cunning 1 54 137
come 1 54 137
into 1 54 137
play. 1 54 137

They 0 54 138
had 0 54 138
to 0 54 138
figure 0 54 138
out 0 54 138
a 0 54 138
way 0 54 138
to 0 54 138
shut 0 54 138
down 0 54 138
the 0 54 138
investigation 0 54 138
so 0 54 138
that 0 54 138
the 0 54 138
frame-up 0 54 138
would 0 54 138
remain 0 54 138
intact. 0 54 138

That’s 1 54 139
why 1 54 139
they 1 54 139
had 1 54 139
shots 1 54 139
fired 1 54 139
from 1 54 139
the 1 54 139
front 1 54 139
and 1 54 139
placed 1 54 139
Oswald 1 54 139
in 1 54 139
the 1 54 139
rear. 1 54 139

The 0 54 140
idea 0 54 140
was 0 54 140
that 0 54 140
since 0 54 140
an 0 54 140
investigation 0 54 140
would 0 54 140
lead 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
Oswald’s 0 54 140
supposed 0 54 140
communist 0 54 140
confederates 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
front, 0 54 140
which 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
turn 0 54 140
would 0 54 140
lead 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
nuclear 0 54 140
war, 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
investigation 0 54 140
had 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
be 0 54 140
shut 0 54 140
down 0 54 140
immediately, 0 54 140
especially 0 54 140
since 0 54 140
it 0 54 140
was 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
CIA 0 54 140
itself 0 54 140
that 0 54 140
had 0 54 140
started 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
assassination 0 54 140
game 0 54 140
by 0 54 140
repeatedly 0 54 140
attempting, 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
partnership 0 54 140
with 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
Mafia, 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
assassinate 0 54 140
Castro. 0 54 140

It 0 54 141
was 0 54 141
one 1 54 141
of 1 54 141
the 1 54 141
most 1 54 141
brilliant 1 54 141
and 1 54 141
cunning 1 54 141
ruses 1 54 141
in 1 54 141
history. 1 54 141

They 0 54 142
get 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
body 0 54 142
out 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
Parkland 0 54 142
by 0 54 142
force, 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
violation 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
Texas 0 54 142
law, 0 54 142
and 0 54 142
put 0 54 142
it 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
hands 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
military 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
Maryland, 0 54 142
which 0 54 142
conducts 0 54 142
a 1 54 142
secret 1 54 142
fraudulent 1 54 142
and 1 54 142

sane 0 254 6
political 0 254 6
environment, 0 254 6
Barack 0 254 6

would 0 254 6
be 0 254 6
tried 0 254 6
for 0 254 6
treason. 1 254 6

Barack 0 254 7
Hussein 0 254 7
Obama 0 254 7
has 0 254 7
planted 0 254 7
seeds 0 254 7

He 0 254 8
is, 0 254 8
without 0 254 8
any 0 254 8
doubt, 0 254 8
the 1 254 8
worst 1 254 8
President 0 254 8
in 0 254 8
American 0 254 8
history. 0 254 8

Fillmore, 0 254 9
Pierce, 0 254 9
Buchanan? 0 254 9

Yes, 0 254 10
the 0 254 10
doughface 0 254 10
Presidents 0 254 10
made 0 254 10
the 0 254 10
Civil 0 254 10
War 0 254 10
inevitable, 0 254 10
but 0 254 10
worse 0 254 10
came 0 254 10
later. 0 254 10

Grant? 0 254 11

Blind 1 254 12
to 1 254 12
corruption 1 254 12
and 0 254 12
out 0 254 12
of 0 254 12
his 0 254 12
depth, 0 254 12
but 0 254 12
there 0 254 12
have 0 254 12
been 0 254 12
worse 0 254 12

he 0 254 12
as 0 254 12

Wilson? 0 254 13

That 0 254 14
black-hearted 1 254 14

so 0 254 14
he 0 254 14

definitely 0 254 14
in 0 254 14
the 0 254 14

Harding? 0 254 15

Nah: 0 254 16
his 0 254 16
tax 0 254 16
cuts 0 254 16
and 0 254 16
return 0 254 16
to 0 254 16

got 0 254 16
the 0 254 16

the 0 254 16

roaring. 0 254 16

FDR 0 254 17
and 0 254 17
LBJ 0 254 17

on 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
damage 0 254 17
they 0 254 17
did 0 254 17
hasn’t 0 254 17
yet 0 254 17
been 0 254 17
presented. 0 254 17

Nixon? 0 254 18

A 0 254 19
crook 1 254 19
and 1 254 19
an 1 254 19
economic 1 254 19
Leftist, 1 254 19
who 0 254 19
betrayed 0 254 19
Taiwan 0 254 19
for 0 254 19
the 0 254 19
People’s 0 254 19
Republic; 0 254 19
his 0 254 19
record 0 254 19
certainly 0 254 19
isn’t 0 254 19
good. 0 254 19

Carter? 0 254 20

Nothing 1 254 21
good 1 254 21
can 0 254 21
be 0 254 21
said 0 254 21
about 0 254 21
his 0 254 21
four 0 254 21
years 0 254 21
of 0 254 21
sanctimony 0 254 21
and 0 254 21
incompetence. 0 254 21

But 0 254 22
there 0 254 22
is 0 254 22
one 0 254 22
thing 0 254 22
Barack 0 254 22
Obama 0 254 22
has 0 254 22
on 0 254 22
all 0 254 22
competitors: 0 254 22
treason. 1 254 22

He 0 254 23
showered 0 254 23
hundreds 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
billions 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
dollars 0 254 23
on 0 254 23
the 0 254 23
Islamic 0 254 23
Republic 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
Iran. 0 254 23

There 0 254 24
are 0 254 24
those 0 254 24
who 0 254 24
say, 0 254 24
“It 0 254 24
was 0 254 24
their 0 254 24
money. 0 254 24

It 0 254 25
belonged 0 254 25
to 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Iranian 0 254 25
government 0 254 25
but 0 254 25
was 0 254 25
frozen 0 254 25
and 0 254 25
not 0 254 25
paid 0 254 25
since 0 254 25
1979.” 0 254 25
Indeed, 0 254 25
and 0 254 25
there 0 254 25
was 0 254 25
a 0 254 25
reason 0 254 25
for 0 254 25
that: 0 254 25
not 0 254 25
even 0 254 25
Jimmy 0 254 25
Carter, 0 254 25
who 0 254 25
made 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Islamic 0 254 25
Republic 0 254 25
of 0 254 25
Iran 0 254 25
possible, 0 254 25
thought 0 254 25
that 0 254 25
money, 0 254 25
which 0 254 25
had 0 254 25
been 0 254 25
paid 0 254 25
by 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Shah’s 0 254 25
government 0 254 25
in 0 254 25
a 0 254 25
canceled 0 254 25
arms 0 254 25
deal, 0 254 25
belonged 0 254 25
to 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
mullahs 0 254 25
who 0 254 25
overthrew 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Shah. 0 254 25

Likewise 0 254 26
Reagan, 0 254 26
George 0 254 26
H. 0 254 26
W. 0 254 26
Bush, 0 254 26
Clinton, 0 254 26
and 0 254 26
George 0 254 26
W. 0 254 26
Bush 0 254 26
all 0 254 26
thought 0 254 26
that 0 254 26
the 0 254 26
Islamic 0 254 26
Republic 0 254 26
was 0 254 26
not 0 254 26
due 0 254 26
money 0 254 26
that 0 254 26
was 0 254 26
owed 0 254 26
to 0 254 26
the 0 254 26
Shah. 0 254 26

Only 0 254 27
Barack 0 254 27
Obama 0 254 27
did. 0 254 27

The 0 254 28
definition 0 254 28
of 0 254 28
treason 1 254 28
is 0 254 28
giving 0 254 28
aid 0 254 28
and 0 254 28
comfort 0 254 28
to 0 254 28
the 0 254 28
enemy. 0 254 28

The 0 254 29
leaders 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
Islamic 0 254 29
Republic 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
Iran 0 254 29
order 0 254 29
their 0 254 29
people 0 254 29
to 0 254 29
chant 0 254 29
“Death 1 254 29
to 1 254 29
America” 1 254 29
in 0 254 29
mosques 0 254 29
every 0 254 29
Friday, 0 254 29
and 0 254 29
repeatedly 0 254 29
vow 0 254 29
that 0 254 29
they 0 254 29
will 0 254 29
ultimately 0 254 29
destroy 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
United 0 254 29
States 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
America 0 254 29
and 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
state 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
Israel. 0 254 29

How 0 254 30
was 0 254 30
giving 0 254 30
them 0 254 30
billions 0 254 30
and 0 254 30
helping 0 254 30
them 0 254 30
skirt 0 254 30
sanctions 0 254 30
applied 0 254 30
by 0 254 30
the 0 254 30
U.S. 0 254 30
government 0 254 30
not 0 254 30
treason? 1 254 30

Other 0 254 31
Presidents 0 254 31
have 0 254 31
been 0 254 31
incompetent, 1 254 31
corrupt, 1 254 31
dishonest, 1 254 31
but 0 254 31
which 0 254 31
has 0 254 31
committed 0 254 31
treason 1 254 31
on 0 254 31
a 0 254 31
scale 0 254 31
to 0 254 31
rival 0 254 31
the 0 254 31
treason 1 254 31
of 0 254 31
Barack 0 254 31
Obama? 0 254 31

The 0 254 32
Iranians 0 254 32
also 0 254 32
operate 0 254 32
a 0 254 32
global 0 254 32
network 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
jihad 0 254 32
terror 0 254 32
organizations, 0 254 32
one 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
which, 0 254 32
Hizballah, 0 254 32
is 0 254 32
quite 0 254 32
active 0 254 32
in 0 254 32
Mexico 0 254 32
now, 0 254 32
with 0 254 32
the 0 254 32
obvious 0 254 32
ultimate 0 254 32
intention 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
crossing 0 254 32
the 0 254 32
border 0 254 32
and 0 254 32
committing 1 254 32
jihad 1 254 32
massacres 1 254 32
of 1 254 32
Americans. 1 254 32

Obama 0 254 33
has 0 254 33
given 0 254 33
a 0 254 33
tremendous 1 254 33
boost 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
these 0 254 33
initiatives, 0 254 33
as 0 254 33
well 0 254 33
as 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
Iran’s 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
program, 0 254 33
with 0 254 33
his 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
deal 0 254 33
that 0 254 33
has 0 254 33
given 0 254 33
the 0 254 33
Iranians 0 254 33
hundreds 0 254 33
of 0 254 33
billions 0 254 33
of 0 254 33
dollars 0 254 33
and 0 254 33
essentially 0 254 33
a 0 254 33
green 0 254 33
light 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
manufacture 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
weapons, 0 254 33
in 0 254 33
exchange 0 254 33
for 0 254 33
absolutely 0 254 33
nothing. 0 254 33

There 0 254 34
is 0 254 34
no 0 254 34
telling 0 254 34
when 0 254 34
the 0 254 34
worst 0 254 34
consequences 0 254 34
of 0 254 34
Obama’s 0 254 34
aid 0 254 34
and 0 254 34
comfort 0 254 34
to 0 254 34
the 0 254 34
Islamic 0 254 34
Republic 0 254 34
of 0 254 34
Iran 0 254 34
will 0 254 34
be 0 254 34
felt. 0 254 34

But 0 254 35
they 0 254 35
likely 0 254 35
will 0 254 35
be 0 254 35
felt 0 254 35
in 0 254 35
one 0 254 35
way 0 254 35
or 0 254 35
another. 0 254 35

Even 0 254 36
as 0 254 36
President 0 254 36
Trump 0 254 36
moves 0 254 36
swiftly 0 254 36
to 0 254 36
restore 0 254 36
sanctions 0 254 36
and 0 254 36
put 0 254 36
Iran 0 254 36
on 0 254 36
notice 0 254 36
that 0 254 36
its 0 254 36
nuclear 0 254 36
activity 0 254 36
and 0 254 36
global 0 254 36
adventurism 0 254 36
will 0 254 36
not 0 254 36
be 0 254 36
tolerated, 0 254 36
those 0 254 36
billions 0 254 36
cannot 0 254 36
be 0 254 36
recovered, 0 254 36
and 0 254 36
the 0 254 36
Iranians 0 254 36
have 0 254 36
already 0 254 36
spent 0 254 36
a 0 254 36
great 0 254 36
deal 0 254 36
for 0 254 36
their 0 254 36
jihad 0 254 36
cause. 0 254 36

However 0 254 37
this 0 254 37
catastrophe 1 254 37
plays 0 254 37
out, 0 254 37
there 0 254 37
is 0 254 37
one 0 254 37
man 0 254 37
who 0 254 37
will 0 254 37
suffer 0 254 37
no 0 254 37
consequences 0 254 37
whatsoever: 0 254 37
Barack 0 254 37
Obama. 0 254 37

That’s 0 254 38
Leftist 0 254 38
Privilege. 0 254 38

It’s 0 254 39
good 0 254 39
to 0 254 39
be 0 254 39
a 0 254 39
powerful 0 254 39
Leftist 0 254 39
in 0 254 39
Washington 0 254 39
nowadays. 0 254 39

Laws? 0 254 40

Pah! 0 254 41

Laws 0 254 41

are 0 254 41

The 0 255 2
indoctrination 1 255 2
is 0 255 2
getting 0 255 2
so 1 255 2
bad, 1 255 2
that 0 255 2
some 0 255 2

The 0 255 4

said 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
top 0 255 13

reasons 0 255 13
that 0 255 13

choose 0 255 13

those 0 255 13
offered 0 255 13
in 0 255 13

dissatisfaction 0 255 13
with 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
academic 0 255 13
curriculum, 0 255 13
and 0 255 13
worries 0 255 13
about 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
school 0 255 13
environment. 0 255 13

Since 0 255 14

not 0 255 14

to 0 255 14

violence 1 255 14
often 0 255 14
perpetrated 0 255 14
at 0 255 14
schools 0 255 14
simply 0 255 14
because 0 255 14
they 0 255 14
are 0 255 14
gun 0 255 14
free 0 255 14
zones, 0 255 14
homeschooling 0 255 14
takes 0 255 14
care 0 255 14
of 0 255 14
that 0 255 14
problem. 0 255 14

“Most 0 255 15

for 0 255 15
more 0 255 15
than 0 255 15
one 0 255 15
reason,” 0 255 15
Ray 0 255 15
told 0 255 15
the 0 255 15
paper. 0 255 15

“But 0 255 16
when 0 255 16
we 0 255 16
ask 0 255 16
families 0 255 16
why 0 255 16
do 0 255 16
they 0 255 16
homeschool, 0 255 16
near 0 255 16
the 0 255 16

means 0 255 18
to 0 255 18
teach 0 255 18

person 0 255 18
to 0 255 18
accept 0 255 18
a 0 255 18

uncritically. 0 255 18

It’s 1 255 19
the 1 255 19
very 1 255 19
reason 1 255 19
the 1 255 19
governments 1 255 19

cannot 0 255 20
logically 0 255 20

critically 0 255 20
understand 0 255 20
that 0 255 20

people 0 255 20
and 0 255 20
taking 0 255 20
their 0 255 20
things 0 255 20
is 0 255 20
wrong 0 255 20
– 0 255 20
even 0 255 20
if 0 255 20
people 0 255 20
who 0 255 20
declare 0 255 20
themselves 0 255 20
government 0 255 20
is 0 255 20
the 0 255 20
one 0 255 20
doing 0 255 20
it. 0 255 20

Governments 1 255 21
are 1 255 21
nothing 1 255 21
more 1 255 21
than 1 255 21
a 1 255 21
handful 1 255 21
of 1 255 21
people 1 255 21
and 0 255 21
have 0 255 21
no 0 255 21
right 0 255 21
to 0 255 21
aggress 0 255 21
against 0 255 21
others. 0 255 21

But 0 255 22
humans 0 255 22
are 0 255 22
taught 0 255 22
at 0 255 22
a 0 255 22

charge, 0 257 24
we 0 257 24
have 0 257 24
some 0 257 24
very 0 257 24
worrying 0 257 24
questions 0 257 24
to 0 257 24
ask. 0 257 24

One 0 257 25
could 0 257 25
start 0 257 25
from 0 257 25
the 0 257 25
observation 0 257 25
that 0 257 25
the 0 257 25
article 0 257 25
is 0 257 25
certainly 0 257 25
not 0 257 25
an 0 257 25
academic 0 257 25
piece, 0 257 25
and 0 257 25
gives 0 257 25
no 0 257 25
concrete 0 257 25
evidence 0 257 25
for 0 257 25
any 0 257 25
of 0 257 25
the 0 257 25
sweeping 0 257 25
claims 0 257 25
it 0 257 25
makes 0 257 25
about 0 257 25
the 0 257 25
so-called 0 257 25
“alt-right” 0 257 25
and 0 257 25
the 0 257 25
“manosphere”; 0 257 25
nor 0 257 25
does 0 257 25
it, 0 257 25
as 0 257 25
any 0 257 25
academic 0 257 25
should 0 257 25
do, 0 257 25
attempt 0 257 25
to 0 257 25
test 0 257 25
ideas 0 257 25
and 0 257 25
consider 0 257 25
alternative 0 257 25
explanations. 0 257 25

(Oddly 0 257 26
enough, 0 257 26
this 0 257 26
makes 0 257 26
it 0 257 26
rather 0 257 26
like 0 257 26
the 0 257 26
groups 0 257 26
it 0 257 26
claims 0 257 26
to 0 257 26
criticize.) 0 257 26

And 0 257 27
the 0 257 27
label 0 257 27
of 0 257 27
“violent 1 257 27
extremist” 1 257 27
turns 0 257 27
out 0 257 27
to 0 257 27
be 0 257 27
used 0 257 27
very 0 257 27
generously. 0 257 27

Ganesh 0 257 28
makes 0 257 28
wild 1 257 28
leaps 0 257 28
and 0 257 28
inferences. 0 257 28

He 0 257 29
talks 0 257 29
of 0 257 29
Darren 0 257 29
Osborne, 0 257 29
the 0 257 29
perpetrator 0 257 29
of 0 257 29
the 0 257 29
vehicular 0 257 29
attack 0 257 29
on 0 257 29
Finsbury 0 257 29
Park 0 257 29
Mosque. 0 257 29

This 0 257 30
was 0 257 30
a 0 257 30
heinous 1 257 30
crime, 0 257 30
and 0 257 30
should 0 257 30
rightly 0 257 30
be 0 257 30
condemned. 0 257 30

But 0 257 31
why 0 257 31
did 0 257 31
Osborne 0 257 31
do 0 257 31
this, 0 257 31
according 0 257 31
to 0 257 31
Ganesh? 0 257 31

The 0 257 32
attack 0 257 32
“was 0 257 32
executed 0 257 32
after 0 257 32
he 0 257 32
had 0 257 32
become 0 257 32
indignant 0 257 32
after 0 257 32
watching 0 257 32
a 0 257 32
BBC 0 257 32
broadcast 0 257 32
on 0 257 32
child 0 257 32
sexual 0 257 32
exploitation 0 257 32
and 0 257 32
turned 0 257 32
to 0 257 32
social 0 257 32
media 0 257 32
to 0 257 32
make 0 257 32
sense 0 257 32
of 0 257 32
it. 0 257 32

He 0 257 33
found 0 257 33
a 0 257 33
narrative 0 257 33
from 0 257 33
British 0 257 33
counter-jihad 0 257 33
groups 0 257 33
closely 0 257 33
aligned 0 257 33
with 0 257 33
the 0 257 33
alt-right, 0 257 33
such 0 257 33
as 0 257 33
Britain 0 257 33
First 0 257 33
and 0 257 33
the 0 257 33
founder 0 257 33
of 0 257 33
the 0 257 33
English 0 257 33
Defence 0 257 33
League 0 257 33
Tommy 0 257 33
Robinson.” 0 257 33
The 0 257 33
British 0 257 33
counter-jihad 0 257 33
movement 0 257 33
is 0 257 33
thus 0 257 33
swept 0 257 33
into 0 257 33
the 0 257 33
same 0 257 33
group 0 257 33
of 0 257 33
violent 1 257 33
extremists 1 257 33
as 0 257 33
Osborne, 0 257 33
because 0 257 33
Ganesh 0 257 33
“knows” 1 257 33
they 0 257 33
encouraged 0 257 33
him. 0 257 33

The 0 257 34
BBC 0 257 34
broadcast 0 257 34
was 0 257 34
the 0 257 34
drama 0 257 34
based 0 257 34
on 0 257 34
real 0 257 34
life, 0 257 34
Three 0 257 34
Girls, 0 257 34
which 0 257 34
showed 0 257 34
real-life 0 257 34
events 0 257 34
of 0 257 34
three 0 257 34
of 0 257 34
the 0 257 34
(very 0 257 34
many) 0 257 34
victims 0 257 34
of 0 257 34
the 0 257 34
Rochdale 0 257 34
Muslim 0 257 34
rape 0 257 34
gangs. 0 257 34

Ganesh 0 257 35
somehow 0 257 35
knows 0 257 35
precisely 0 257 35
what 0 257 35
went 0 257 35
on 0 257 35
in 0 257 35
Osborne’s 0 257 35
mind. 0 257 35

Rather 0 257 36
than 0 257 36
thinking 0 257 36
that 0 257 36
it 0 257 36
was 0 257 36
outrage 0 257 36
at 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
behavior 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
gangs 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
Muslim 0 257 36
men 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
Pakistani 0 257 36
background 0 257 36
who 0 257 36
abused 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
girls 0 257 36
portrayed 0 257 36
in 0 257 36
Three 0 257 36
Girls 0 257 36
that 0 257 36
caused 0 257 36
Osborne 0 257 36
to 0 257 36
lose 0 257 36
his 0 257 36
mind 0 257 36
and 0 257 36
commit 0 257 36
his 0 257 36
terrible 1 257 36
crime, 0 257 36
Ganesh 0 257 36
blames 0 257 36
Obsorne’s 0 257 36
act 0 257 36
on 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
likes 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
Tommy 0 257 36
Robinson. 0 257 36

Yet 0 257 37
Robinson 0 257 37
explicitly 0 257 37
fights 0 257 37
AGAINST 1 257 37
political 0 257 37
violence. 0 257 37

What 1 257 38
“narrative 1 257 38
from 1 257 38
British 1 257 38
counter-jihad 1 257 38
groups” 1 257 38
can 1 257 38
one 1 257 38
find 1 257 38
which 1 257 38
suggests 1 257 38
driving 1 257 38
vehicles 1 257 38
into 1 257 38
innocent 1 257 38
Muslims 1 257 38
standing 1 257 38
outside 1 257 38
a 1 257 38
mosque? 1 257 38

I’m 0 257 39
sure 0 257 39
if 0 257 39
there 0 257 39
was 0 257 39
any, 0 257 39
Ganesh 0 257 39
would, 0 257 39
as 0 257 39
a 0 257 39
researcher 0 257 39
at 0 257 39
an 0 257 39
elite 0 257 39
institution, 0 257 39
be 0 257 39
able 0 257 39
to 0 257 39
find 0 257 39
it. 0 257 39

But 0 257 40
there 1 257 40
is 1 257 40
none 1 257 40
offered 1 257 40
– 0 257 40
only 0 257 40
surmise 0 257 40
and 0 257 40
Ganesh’s 0 257 40
mindreading 0 257 40
techniques. 0 257 40

I 0 257 41
suppose 0 257 41
if 0 257 41
you’re 0 257 41
paid 0 257 41
to 0 257 41
fight 0 257 41
online 0 257 41
extremism, 0 257 41
you’d 0 257 41
better 0 257 41
find 0 257 41
it, 0 257 41
or 0 257 41
you’re 0 257 41
out 0 257 41
of 0 257 41
a 0 257 41
job 0 257 41
and 0 257 41
short 0 257 41
of 0 257 41
academic 0 257 41
publication. 0 257 41

We 0 257 42
have 0 257 42
also 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
ridiculous 1 257 42
idea 0 257 42
that 0 257 42
Tommy 0 257 42
Robinson 0 257 42
is 0 257 42
“alt-right.” 0 257 42
He, 0 257 42
in 0 257 42
fact, 0 257 42
describes 0 257 42
himself 0 257 42
as 0 257 42
a 0 257 42
centrist 0 257 42
– 0 257 42
he’s 0 257 42
said 0 257 42
he 0 257 42
agrees 0 257 42
with 0 257 42
Labour 0 257 42
on 0 257 42
some 0 257 42
things, 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
Tories 0 257 42
on 0 257 42
other 0 257 42
things, 0 257 42
and 0 257 42
he 0 257 42
left 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
EDL 0 257 42
precisely 0 257 42
because 0 257 42
he 0 257 42
didn’t 0 257 42
like 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
infiltration 0 257 42
by 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
far 0 257 42
right. 0 257 42

He 0 257 43
shows 0 257 43
no 0 257 43
hint 0 257 43
of 0 257 43
racism 0 257 43
or 0 257 43
of 0 257 43
white 0 257 43
supremacism. 0 257 43

The 0 257 44
writer 0 257 44
of 0 257 44
this 0 257 44
shoddy 1 257 44
article 0 257 44

We 0 257 45
have 0 257 45
to 0 257 45
ask. 0 257 45

Is 0 257 46
it 0 257 46
simply 0 257 46
a 0 257 46
coincidence 0 257 46
that 0 257 46

is 0 257 46
now 0 257 46
in 0 257 46

that 0 257 46

who 0 257 46
presents 0 257 46
such 0 257 46
a 0 257 46
misleading 0 257 46

Pilger’s 0 258 6
Statement 0 258 6

“There 0 258 7

The 1 258 11
fakery 1 258 11
of 0 258 11

not 0 258 12

they 0 258 12
have 1 258 12
not 1 258 12
destroyed 1 258 12
the 1 258 12

Only 1 258 13
the 1 258 13
silence 1 258 13
of 1 258 13

Dennis 0 258 18
Bernstein: 0 258 18
We 0 258 18
continue 0 258 18
our 0 258 18
discussion 0 258 18
of 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
case 0 258 18
of 0 258 18
Julian 0 258 18
Assange, 0 258 18
now 0 258 18
in 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
Ecuadorian 0 258 18
embassy 0 258 18
in 0 258 18
Great 0 258 18
Britain. 0 258 18

John 0 258 19
Pilger, 0 258 19
it 0 258 19
is 0 258 19
great 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
talk 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
you 0 258 19
again. 0 258 19

But 0 258 20
it 0 258 20
is 0 258 20
a 1 258 20
profound 1 258 20
tragedy, 1 258 20
John, 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
way 0 258 20
they 0 258 20
are 0 258 20
treating 0 258 20
Julian 0 258 20
Assange, 0 258 20
this 0 258 20
prolific 1 258 20
journalist 1 258 20
and 1 258 20
publisher 1 258 20
who 0 258 20
so 0 258 20
many 0 258 20
other 0 258 20
journalists 0 258 20
have 0 258 20
depended 0 258 20
on 0 258 20
in 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
past. 0 258 20

He 0 258 21
has 0 258 21
been 0 258 21
totally 1 258 21
left 1 258 21
out 1 258 21
in 1 258 21
the 1 258 21
cold 1 258 21
to 1 258 21
fend 1 258 21
for 1 258 21
himself. 1 258 21

John 0 258 22
Pilger: 0 258 22
I 0 258 22
have 0 258 22
never 0 258 22
known 0 258 22
anything 0 258 22
like 0 258 22
it. 0 258 22

There 0 258 23
is 0 258 23
a 0 258 23
kind 0 258 23
of 0 258 23
eerie 1 258 23
silence 1 258 23
around 0 258 23
the 0 258 23
Julian 0 258 23
Assange 0 258 23
case. 0 258 23

Julian 0 258 24
has 0 258 24
been 0 258 24
vindicated 0 258 24
in 0 258 24
every 0 258 24
possible 0 258 24
way 0 258 24
and 0 258 24
yet 0 258 24
he 0 258 24
is 0 258 24
isolated 0 258 24
as 0 258 24
few 0 258 24
people 0 258 24
are 0 258 24
these 0 258 24
days. 0 258 24

He 0 258 25
is 0 258 25
cut 0 258 25
off 0 258 25
from 0 258 25
the 0 258 25
very 0 258 25
tools 0 258 25
of 0 258 25
his 0 258 25
trade, 0 258 25
visitors 0 258 25
aren’t 0 258 25
allowed. 0 258 25

I 0 258 26
was 0 258 26
in 0 258 26
London 0 258 26
recently 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
I 0 258 26
couldn’t 0 258 26
see 0 258 26
him, 0 258 26
although 0 258 26
I 0 258 26
spoke 0 258 26
to 0 258 26
people 0 258 26
who 0 258 26
had 0 258 26
seen 0 258 26
him. 0 258 26

Rafael 0 258 27
Correa, 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
former 0 258 27
president 0 258 27
of 0 258 27
Ecuador, 0 258 27
said 0 258 27
recently 0 258 27
that 0 258 27
he 1 258 27
regarded 1 258 27
what 1 258 27
they 1 258 27
are 1 258 27
doing 1 258 27
to 1 258 27
Julian 1 258 27
now 1 258 27
as 1 258 27
torture. 1 258 27

It 0 258 28
was 0 258 28
Correa’s 0 258 28
government 0 258 28
that 0 258 28
gave 0 258 28
Julian 0 258 28
political 0 258 28
refuge, 0 258 28
which 0 258 28
has 0 258 28
been 0 258 28
betrayed 0 258 28
now 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
his 0 258 28
successor, 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
government 0 258 28
led 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
Lenin 0 258 28
Moreno, 0 258 28
which 0 258 28
is 0 258 28
back 0 258 28
to 0 258 28
sucking 1 258 28
up 1 258 28
to 1 258 28
the 1 258 28
United 1 258 28
States 1 258 28
in 1 258 28
the 1 258 28
time-honored 1 258 28
way, 1 258 28
with 0 258 28
Julian 0 258 28
as 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
pawn 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
victim. 0 258 28

Should 0 258 29
be 0 258 29
a 1 258 29
‘Constitutional 1 258 29
Hero’ 1 258 29

But 0 258 30
really 0 258 30
it 0 258 30
comes 0 258 30
down 0 258 30
to 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
British 0 258 30
government. 0 258 30

Although 0 258 31
he 0 258 31
is 0 258 31
still 0 258 31
in 0 258 31
a 0 258 31
foreign 0 258 31
embassy 0 258 31
and 0 258 31
actually 0 258 31
has 0 258 31
Ecuadorian 0 258 31
nationality, 0 258 31
his 0 258 31
right 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
passage 0 258 31
out 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
that 0 258 31
embassy 0 258 31
should 0 258 31
be 0 258 31
guaranteed 0 258 31
by 0 258 31
the 0 258 31
British 0 258 31
government. 0 258 31

The 0 258 32
United 0 258 32
Nations 0 258 32
Working 0 258 32
Party 0 258 32
on 0 258 32
Unlawful 0 258 32
Detentions 0 258 32
has 0 258 32
made 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
clear. 0 258 32

Britain 0 258 33
took 0 258 33
part 0 258 33
in 0 258 33
an 0 258 33
investigation 0 258 33
which 0 258 33
determined 0 258 33
that 0 258 33
Julian 0 258 33
was 0 258 33
a 0 258 33
political 0 258 33
refugee 0 258 33
and 0 258 33
that 0 258 33
a 1 258 33
great 1 258 33
miscarriage 1 258 33
of 1 258 33
justice 1 258 33
had 0 258 33
been 0 258 33
imposed 0 258 33
on 0 258 33
him. 0 258 33

It 0 258 34
is 0 258 34
very 0 258 34
good 0 258 34
that 0 258 34
you 0 258 34
are 0 258 34
doing 0 258 34
this, 0 258 34
Dennis, 0 258 34
because 0 258 34
even 0 258 34
in 0 258 34
the 0 258 34
media 0 258 34
outside 0 258 34
the 0 258 34
mainstream, 0 258 34
there 0 258 34
is 0 258 34
this 0 258 34
silence 0 258 34
about 0 258 34
Julian. 0 258 34

The 0 258 35
streets 0 258 35
outside 0 258 35
the 0 258 35
embassy 0 258 35
are 1 258 35
virtually 1 258 35
empty, 1 258 35
whereas 0 258 35
they 1 258 35
should 1 258 35
be 1 258 35
full 1 258 35
of 1 258 35
people 1 258 35
saying 1 258 35
that 1 258 35
we 1 258 35
are 1 258 35
with 1 258 35
you. 1 258 35

The 0 258 36
principles 0 258 36
involved 0 258 36
in 0 258 36
this 0 258 36
case 0 258 36
are 0 258 36
absolutely 1 258 36
clear-cut. 1 258 36

Number 0 258 37
one 0 258 37
is 0 258 37
justice. 0 258 37

The 1 258 38
injustice 1 258 38
done 1 258 38
to 1 258 38
this 1 258 38
man 1 258 38
is 1 258 38
legion, 1 258 38
both 0 258 38
in 0 258 38
terms 0 258 38
of 0 258 38
the 1 258 38
bogus 1 258 38
Swedish 1 258 38
case 1 258 38
and 0 258 38
now 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
fact 0 258 38
that 0 258 38
he 0 258 38
must 0 258 38
remain 0 258 38
in 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
embassy 0 258 38
and 0 258 38
can’t 0 258 38
leave 0 258 38
without 0 258 38
being 0 258 38
arrested, 0 258 38
extradited 0 258 38
to 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
United 0 258 38
States 0 258 38
and 0 258 38
ending 1 258 38
up 1 258 38
in 1 258 38
a 1 258 38
hell 1 258 38
hole. 1 258 38

But 1 258 39
it 1 258 39
is 1 258 39
also 1 258 39
about 1 258 39
freedom 1 258 39
of 1 258 39
speech, 1 258 39
about 1 258 39
our 1 258 39
right 1 258 39
to 1 258 39
know, 1 258 39
which 1 258 39
is 1 258 39
enshrined 1 258 39
in 1 258 39
the 1 258 39
United 1 258 39
States 1 258 39
Constitution. 1 258 39

If 0 258 40
the 0 258 40
Constitution 0 258 40
were 0 258 40
taken 0 258 40
literally, 0 258 40
Julian 0 258 40
would 0 258 40
be 0 258 40
a 1 258 40
constitutional 1 258 40
hero, 1 258 40
actually. 0 258 40

Instead, 0 258 41
I 0 258 41
understand 0 258 41
the 0 258 41
indictment 0 258 41
they 0 258 41
are 0 258 41
trying 0 258 41
to 0 258 41
concoct 0 258 41
reads 0 258 41
like 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
charge 0 258 41
of 0 258 41
espionage! 0 258 41

It’s 1 258 42
so 1 258 42
ridiculous.That 1 258 42
is 0 258 42
the 0 258 42
situation 0 258 42
as 0 258 42
I 0 258 42
see 0 258 42
it, 0 258 42
Dennis. 0 258 42

It 0 258 43
is 0 258 43
not 0 258 43
a 0 258 43
happy 0 258 43
one 0 258 43
but 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
is 0 258 43
one 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
people 0 258 43
should 0 258 43
rally 0 258 43
to 0 258 43
quickly. 0 258 43

DB: 0 258 44
His 1 258 44
journalistic 1 258 44
brethren 1 258 44
are 0 258 44
sounding 0 258 44
like 0 258 44
his 0 258 44
prosecutors. 0 258 44

They 0 258 45
want 0 258 45
to 0 258 45
get 0 258 45
behind 0 258 45
Russia-gate 1 258 45
freaks 1 258 45
like 0 258 45
Congressman 0 258 45
Adam 0 258 45
Schiff 0 258 45
and 0 258 45
Mike 0 258 45
Pompeo, 0 258 45
who 0 258 45
would 0 258 45
like 0 258 45
to 0 258 45
see 0 258 45
Assange 0 258 45
in 1 258 45
jail 1 258 45
forever 1 258 45
or 1 258 45
even 1 258 45
executed. 1 258 45

How 0 258 46
do 0 258 46
you 0 258 46
respond 0 258 46
to 0 258 46
journalists 0 258 46
acting 0 258 46
like 0 258 46
prosecutors, 0 258 46
some 0 258 46
of 0 258 46
whom 0 258 46
used 0 258 46
his 0 258 46
material 0 258 46
to 0 258 46
do 0 258 46
stories? 0 258 46

This 0 258 47
is 0 258 47
a 0 258 47
terrible 0 258 47
time 0 258 47
for 0 258 47
journalism. 0 258 47

JP: 0 258 48
You 0 258 48
are 0 258 48
absolutely 0 258 48
right: 0 258 48
It 0 258 48
is 0 258 48
a 0 258 48
terrible 0 258 48
time 0 258 48
for 0 258 48
journalism. 0 258 48

I 1 258 49
have 1 258 49
never 1 258 49
known 1 258 49
anything 1 258 49
quite 1 258 49
like 1 258 49
it 1 258 49
in 1 258 49
my 1 258 49
career. 1 258 49

That 0 258 50
said, 0 258 50
it 0 258 50
is 0 258 50
not 0 258 50
new. 0 258 50

There 0 258 51
has 0 258 51
always 0 258 51
been 0 258 51
a 0 258 51
so-called 0 258 51
mainstream 0 258 51
which 0 258 51
really 0 258 51
comes 0 258 51
down 0 258 51
to 0 258 51
great 0 258 51
power 0 258 51
in 0 258 51
media. 0 258 51

It 0 258 52
has 0 258 52
always 0 258 52
existed, 0 258 52
particularly 0 258 52
in 0 258 52
the 0 258 52
United 0 258 52
States. 0 258 52

The 0 258 53
Pulitzer 0 258 53
Prize 0 258 53
this 0 258 53
year 0 258 53
was 0 258 53
awarded 0 258 53
to 0 258 53
The 0 258 53
New 0 258 53
York 0 258 53
Times 0 258 53
and 0 258 53
The 0 258 53
Washington 0 258 53
Post 0 258 53
for 0 258 53
witch-hunting 1 258 53
around 1 258 53
Russia-gate! 1 258 53

They 0 258 54
were 0 258 54
praised 0 258 54
for 0 258 54
“how 0 258 54
deeply 0 258 54
sourced 0 258 54
their 0 258 54
investigations 0 258 54
were.” 0 258 54
Their 1 258 54
investigations 1 258 54
turned 1 258 54
up 1 258 54
not 1 258 54
a 1 258 54
shred 1 258 54
of 1 258 54
real 1 258 54
evidence 1 258 54
to 0 258 54
suggest 0 258 54
any 0 258 54
serious 0 258 54
Russian 0 258 54
intervention 0 258 54
in 0 258 54
the 0 258 54
2016 0 258 54
election. 0 258 54

Like 0 258 55
Webb 0 258 55

The 0 258 56
Julian 0 258 56
Assange 0 258 56
case 0 258 56
reminds 0 258 56
me 0 258 56
of 0 258 56
the 0 258 56
Gary 0 258 56
Webb 0 258 56
case. 0 258 56

Bob 0 258 57
Parry 0 258 57
was 0 258 57
one 0 258 57
of 0 258 57
Gary 0 258 57
Webb’s 0 258 57
few 0 258 57
supporters 0 258 57
in 0 258 57
the 0 258 57
media. 0 258 57

Webb’s 0 258 58
“Dark 0 258 58
Alliance” 0 258 58
series 0 258 58
contained 0 258 58
evidence 0 258 58
that 0 258 58
cocaine 0 258 58
trafficking 0 258 58
was 0 258 58
going 0 258 58
on 0 258 58
with 0 258 58
the 0 258 58
connivance 0 258 58
of 0 258 58
the 0 258 58
CIA. 0 258 58

Later 0 258 59
Webb 0 258 59
was 1 258 59
hounded 1 258 59
by 0 258 59
fellow 0 258 59
journalists 0 258 59
and, 0 258 59
unable 0 258 59
to 0 258 59
find 0 258 59
work, 0 258 59
he 0 258 59
eventually 0 258 59
committed 0 258 59
suicide. 0 258 59

The 0 258 60
CIA 0 258 60
Inspector 0 258 60
General 0 258 60
subsequently 0 258 60
vindicated 0 258 60
him. 0 258 60

Now, 0 258 61
Julian 0 258 61
Assange 0 258 61
is 0 258 61
a 0 258 61
long 0 258 61
way 0 258 61
from 0 258 61
taking 0 258 61
his 0 258 61
own 0 258 61
life. 0 258 61

His 0 258 62
resilience 0 258 62
is 0 258 62
remarkable. 0 258 62

But 0 258 63
he 0 258 63
is 0 258 63
still 0 258 63
a 0 258 63
human 0 258 63
being 0 258 63
and 0 258 63
he 0 258 63
has 0 258 63
taken 1 258 63
such 1 258 63
a 1 258 63
battering. 1 258 63

Probably 0 258 64
the 0 258 64
hardest 0 258 64
thing 0 258 64
for 0 258 64
him 0 258 64
to 0 258 64
take 0 258 64
is 0 258 64
the 1 258 64
utter 1 258 64
hypocrisy 1 258 64
of 1 258 64
news 1 258 64
organizations—like 1 258 64
The 0 258 64
New 0 258 64
York 0 258 64
Times, 0 258 64
which 0 258 64
published 0 258 64
the 0 258 64
WikiLeaks 0 258 64
“War 0 258 64
Logs” 0 258 64
and 0 258 64
“Cablegate,” 0 258 64
The 0 258 64
Washington 0 258 64
Post 0 258 64
and 0 258 64
The 0 258 64
Guardian, 0 258 64
which 0 258 64
has 0 258 64
taken 0 258 64
a 1 258 64
vindictive 1 258 64
delight 1 258 64
in 1 258 64
tormenting 1 258 64
Julian. 1 258 64

The 0 258 65
Guardian 0 258 65
a 0 258 65
few 0 258 65
years 0 258 65
ago 0 258 65
got 0 258 65
a 0 258 65
Pulitzer 0 258 65
Prize 0 258 65
writing 0 258 65
about 0 258 65
Snowden. 0 258 65

But 0 258 66
their 0 258 66
coverage 0 258 66
of 0 258 66
Snowden 0 258 66
left 0 258 66
him 0 258 66
in 0 258 66
Hong 0 258 66
Kong. 0 258 66

It 0 258 67
was 0 258 67
WikiLeaks 0 258 67
that 0 258 67
got 0 258 67
Snowden 0 258 67
out 0 258 67
of 0 258 67
Hong 0 258 67
Kong 0 258 67
and 0 258 67
to 0 258 67
safety. 0 258 67

Professionally, 0 258 68
I 1 258 68
find 1 258 68
this 1 258 68
one 1 258 68
of 1 258 68
the 1 258 68
most 1 258 68
unsavory 1 258 68
and 1 258 68
immoral 1 258 68
things 1 258 68
I 1 258 68
have 1 258 68
seen 1 258 68
in 1 258 68
my 1 258 68
career. 1 258 68

The 0 258 69
persecution 0 258 69
of 0 258 69
this 0 258 69
man 0 258 69
by 0 258 69
huge 0 258 69
media 0 258 69
organizations 0 258 69
which 0 258 69
have 0 258 69
drawn 0 258 69
great 0 258 69
benefit 0 258 69
from 0 258 69
WikiLeaks. 0 258 69

One 1 258 70
of 1 258 70
Assange’s 1 258 70
great 1 258 70
tormentors, 1 258 70
The 1 258 70
Guardian‘s 1 258 70
Luke 1 258 70
Harding, 1 258 70
made 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
great 0 258 70
deal 0 258 70
of 0 258 70
money 0 258 70
with 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
Hollywood 0 258 70
version 0 258 70
of 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
book 0 258 70
that 0 258 70
he 0 258 70
and 0 258 70
David 0 258 70
Lee 0 258 70
wrote 0 258 70
in 0 258 70
which 0 258 70
they 0 258 70
basically 0 258 70
attacked 0 258 70
their 0 258 70
source. 0 258 70

I 0 258 71
suppose 0 258 71
you 0 258 71
have 0 258 71
to 0 258 71
be 0 258 71
a 0 258 71
psychiatrist 0 258 71
to 0 258 71
understand 0 258 71
all 0 258 71
of 0 258 71
this. 0 258 71

My 0 258 72
understanding 0 258 72
is 0 258 72
that 0 258 72
so 0 258 72
many 0 258 72
of 0 258 72
these 0 258 72
journalists 0 258 72
are 0 258 72
shamed. 0 258 72

They 0 258 73
realize 0 258 73
that 0 258 73
WikiLeaks 0 258 73
has 0 258 73
done 0 258 73
what 0 258 73
they 0 258 73
should 0 258 73
have 0 258 73
done 0 258 73
a 0 258 73
long 0 258 73
time 0 258 73
ago, 0 258 73
and 0 258 73
that 0 258 73
is 0 258 73
to 0 258 73
tell 0 258 73
us 0 258 73
how 0 258 73
governments 0 258 73
lie. 0 258 73

DB: 0 258 74
One 0 258 74
thing 0 258 74
that 0 258 74
disturbs 0 258 74
me 0 258 74
greatly 0 258 74
is 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
way 0 258 74
in 0 258 74
which 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
Western 0 258 74
corporate 0 258 74
press 0 258 74
speculate 0 258 74
about 0 258 74
Russian 0 258 74
involvement 0 258 74
in 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
U.S. 0 258 74
2016 0 258 74
election, 0 258 74
that 0 258 74
it 1 258 74
was 1 258 74
a 1 258 74
hack 1 258 74
through 1 258 74
Julian 1 258 74
Assange. 1 258 74

Any 0 258 75
serious 0 258 75
investigator 0 258 75
would 0 258 75
want 0 258 75
to 0 258 75
know 0 258 75
who 0 258 75
would 0 258 75
be 0 258 75
motivated. 0 258 75

And 0 258 76
yet 0 258 76
the 0 258 76
possibility 0 258 76
that 0 258 76
it 0 258 76
might 0 258 76
be 0 258 76
the 1 258 76

the 1 258 78

that 0 258 78
this 0 258 78

the 0 258 78

now 0 258 79
we 0 258 79
have 0 258 79
the 0 258 79
DNC 0 258 79
suing 0 258 79
WikiLeaks! 0 258 79

There’s 0 258 80
a 0 258 80
kind 0 258 80
of 0 258 80
farcical 1 258 80
element 1 258 80

this. 0 258 80

none 0 258 81

this 0 258 81
came 0 258 81
from 0 258 81
the 0 258 81
Russians. 0 258 81

That 0 258 82
WikiLeaks 0 258 82
is 0 258 82
somehow 0 258 82
in 1 258 82
bed 1 258 82
with 1 258 82
the 1 258 82
Russians 1 258 82
is 1 258 82
ludicrous. 1 258 82

WikiLeaks 0 258 83

a 0 258 85
very 0 258 85
high-profile 0 258 85

to 0 258 85
the 0 258 85

recently 0 258 85

with 0 258 86
Congressman 0 258 86

he 1 258 86
yelled 1 258 86
out 1 258 86
“What 0 258 86
about 0 258 86
Julian 0 258 86

was 0 258 86
attacked 0 258 86

dragged 0 258 86
out. 0 258 86

was 0 258 87
if 0 258 87
everyone 0 258 87
there 0 258 87
was 0 258 87

that 0 258 87
one 1 258 87
of 1 258 87
their 1 258 87

brutalized. 1 258 87

JP: 0 258 88
Randy 0 258 88
shouted 0 258 88
some 0 258 88
truth. 0 258 88

It 0 258 89
is 0 258 89
very 0 258 89
similar 0 258 89
to 0 258 89
what 0 258 89
happened 0 258 89
to 0 258 89

former 0 258 90
member 0 258 90
of 0 258 90
the 0 258 90

but 0 258 90
extremely 0 258 90
principled. 0 258 90

I 0 258 91
might 0 258 91
suggest 0 258 91
he 1 258 91
is 1 258 91
a 1 258 91
renegade 1 258 91
now. 0 258 91

to 0 258 92
watch 0 258 92
these 0 258 92
four 0 258 92
armed 0 258 92
guards 0 258 92
who 0 258 92
kept 0 258 92
shouting 0 258 92
“Stop 0 258 92

stop 0 258 92
resisting!” 0 258 92

beating 1 258 92
the 1 258 92
hell 1 258 92
out 1 258 92
of 1 258 92
him! 1 258 92

JP: 0 258 93
I 0 258 93
thought 0 258 93
the 0 258 93
image 0 258 93
of 0 258 93
Ray 0 258 93
being 1 258 93
hauled 1 258 93
off 1 258 93
was 0 258 93
particularly 0 258 93
telling. 0 258 93

These 1 258 94
four 1 258 94
overweight, 1 258 94
obviously 1 258 94
ill-trained 1 258 94
young 1 258 94
men 1 258 94
manhandling 1 258 94
Ray, 0 258 94
who 0 258 94
is 0 258 94
78 0 258 94
years 0 258 94
old. 0 258 94

There 0 258 95
was 0 258 95
something 0 258 95
highly 0 258 95
emblematic 0 258 95
about 0 258 95
that 0 258 95
for 0 258 95
me. 0 258 95

He 0 258 96
stood 0 258 96
up 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
challenge 0 258 96
the 0 258 96
fact 0 258 96
that 0 258 96
the 0 258 96
CIA 0 258 96
was 0 258 96
about 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
hand 0 258 96
over 0 258 96
leadership 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
a 0 258 96
person 0 258 96
who 0 258 96
had 0 258 96
been 0 258 96
in 0 258 96
charge 0 258 96
of 0 258 96
torture. 0 258 96

It 0 258 97
is 0 258 97
both 1 258 97
shocking 1 258 97
and 1 258 97
surreal, 1 258 97
which 0 258 97
of 0 258 97
course 0 258 97
the 0 258 97
Julian 0 258 97
Assange 0 258 97
case 0 258 97
is 0 258 97
as 0 258 97
well. 0 258 97

But 0 258 98
real 0 258 98
journalism 0 258 98
should 0 258 98
be 0 258 98
able 0 258 98
to 0 258 98
get 0 258 98
through 0 258 98
the 1 258 98
shocking 1 258 98
and 1 258 98
the 1 258 98
surreal 1 258 98
and 0 258 98
get 0 258 98
to 0 258 98
the 0 258 98
truth. 0 258 98

There 0 258 99
is 0 258 99
so 0 258 99
much 0 258 99
collusion 0 258 99
now, 0 258 99
with 0 258 99
all 0 258 99
these 0 258 99
dark 1 258 99
and 1 258 99
menacing 1 258 99
developments. 1 258 99

It 0 258 100
is 0 258 100
almost 0 258 100
as 0 258 100
if 0 258 100
the 1 258 100
word 1 258 100
“journalism” 1 258 100
is 1 258 100
becoming 1 258 100
blighted. 1 258 100

DB: 0 258 101
There 0 258 101
has 0 258 101
certainly 0 258 101
been 0 258 101
a 0 258 101
lot 0 258 101
of 0 258 101
collusion 0 258 101
when 0 258 101
it 0 258 101
comes 0 258 101
to 0 258 101

Then 0 258 102
the 0 258 102
word 0 258 102
“collusion” 0 258 102
is 0 258 102
quite 0 258 102
appropriate. 0 258 102

JP:That’s 0 258 103
the 0 258 103
ultimate 0 258 103
collusion. 0 258 103

But 0 258 104
that’s 0 258 104
collusion 1 258 104
with 0 258 104
silence. 0 258 104

Never 1 258 105
has 1 258 105
there 1 258 105
been 1 258 105
a 1 258 105
collusion 1 258 105
like 1 258 105
the 1 258 105
one 1 258 105
between 1 258 105
the 1 258 105
U.S. 1 258 105

Israel. 1 258 105

It 0 258 106

another 0 258 106
word 0 258 106
and 0 258 106
that 0 258 106
is 0 258 106
“immunity.” 0 258 106

a 0 258 106
moral 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
cultural 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
geopolitical 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
legal 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106

a 0 258 106

immunity. 1 258 106

occupation 0 258 108
of 0 258 108
their 0 258 108

we 0 258 115
have 0 258 115
a 0 258 115
right 0 258 115
to 0 258 115
know 0 258 115
what 0 258 115
those 0 258 115
who 0 258 115
wish 0 258 115
to 0 258 115
control 0 258 115
our 0 258 115
lives 0 258 115
are 0 258 115
doing 0 258 115
in 0 258 115
secret. 0 258 115

The 0 258 116
right 0 258 116
to 0 258 116
know 0 258 116
what 0 258 116

our 0 258 116

right. 0 258 116

Julian 0 258 117
feels 0 258 117
very 0 258 117
passionately 0 258 117
about 0 258 117
this. 0 258 117

There 0 258 118
were 0 258 118
times 0 258 118
when 0 258 118
he 0 258 118
could 0 258 118
have 0 258 118
compromised 0 258 118
slightly 0 258 118
in 0 258 118
order 0 258 118
to 0 258 118
possibly 0 258 118
help 0 258 118
his 0 258 118
situation. 0 258 118

There 0 258 119
were 0 258 119
times 0 258 119
when 0 258 119
I 0 258 119
said 0 258 119
to 0 258 119
him, 0 258 119
“Why 0 258 119
don’t 0 258 119
you 0 258 119
just 0 258 119
suspend 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
for 0 258 119
a 0 258 119
while 0 258 119
and 0 258 119
go 0 258 119
along 0 258 119
with 0 258 119
it?” 0 258 119
Of 0 258 119
course, 0 258 119
I 0 258 119
knew 0 258 119
beforehand 0 258 119
what 0 258 119
his 0 258 119
answer 0 258 119
would 0 258 119
be 0 258 119
and 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
was 0 258 119
“no.” 0 258 119
The 0 258 119
enormous 0 258 119
amount 0 258 119
of 0 258 119
information 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
has 0 258 119
come 0 258 119
from 0 258 119
WikiLeaks, 0 258 119
particularly 0 258 119
in 0 258 119
recent 0 258 119
years, 0 258 119
has 0 258 119
amounted 0 258 119
to 0 258 119
an 1 258 119
extraordinary 1 258 119
public 1 258 119
service. 1 258 119

I 0 258 120
was 0 258 120
reading 0 258 120
just 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
other 0 258 120
day 0 258 120
a 0 258 120
2006 0 258 120
WikiLeaks 0 258 120
cable 0 258 120
from 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
U.S. 0 258 120
embassy 0 258 120
in 0 258 120
Caracas 0 258 120
which 0 258 120
was 0 258 120
addressed 0 258 120
to 0 258 120
other 0 258 120
agencies 0 258 120
in 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
region. 0 258 120

This 0 258 121
was 0 258 121
four 0 258 121
years 0 258 121
after 0 258 121
the 0 258 121
U.S. 0 258 121
tried 0 258 121
to 0 258 121
get 0 258 121
rid 0 258 121
of 0 258 121
Chavez 0 258 121
in 0 258 121
a 0 258 121
coup. 0 258 121

It 0 258 122
detailed 0 258 122
how 0 258 122
subversion 0 258 122
should 0 258 122
work. 0 258 122

Of 0 258 123
course, 0 258 123
they 1 258 123
dressed 1 258 123
it 1 258 123
up 1 258 123
as 0 258 123
human 0 258 123
rights 0 258 123
work 0 258 123
and 0 258 123
so 0 258 123
on. 0 258 123

I 0 258 124
was 0 258 124
reading 0 258 124
this 0 258 124
official 0 258 124
document 0 258 124
thinking 0 258 124
how 0 258 124
the 0 258 124
information 0 258 124
contained 0 258 124
in 0 258 124
it 0 258 124
was 0 258 124
worth 0 258 124
years 0 258 124
of 0 258 124
the 0 258 124
kind 0 258 124
of 0 258 124
distorted 0 258 124
reporting 0 258 124
from 0 258 124
Venezuela. 0 258 124

It 0 258 125
also 0 258 125
reminds 0 258 125
us 0 258 125
that 0 258 125
so-called 0 258 125
“meddling” 0 258 125
by 0 258 125
Russia 0 258 125
in 0 258 125
the 0 258 125
U.S. 0 258 125
is 0 258 125
just 0 258 125
nonsense. 0 258 125

The 0 258 126
word 0 258 126
“meddling” 0 258 126
doesn’t 0 258 126
apply 0 258 126
to 0 258 126
the 0 258 126
kind 0 258 126
of 0 258 126
action 0 258 126
implied 0 258 126
in 0 258 126
this 0 258 126
document. 0 258 126

It 0 258 127
is 0 258 127
intervention 0 258 127
in 0 258 127
another 0 258 127
country’s 0 258 127
affairs. 0 258 127

WikiLeaks 0 258 128
has 0 258 128
done 0 258 128
that 0 258 128
all 0 258 128
over 0 258 128
the 0 258 128
world. 0 258 128

It 0 258 129
has 0 258 129
given 0 258 129
people 0 258 129
the 0 258 129
information 0 258 129
they 0 258 129
have 0 258 129
a 0 258 129
right 0 258 129
to 0 258 129
have. 0 258 129

They 0 258 130
had 0 258 130
a 0 258 130
right 0 258 130
to 0 258 130
find 0 258 130
out 0 258 130
from 0 258 130
the 0 258 130
so-called 0 258 130
“War 0 258 130
Logs” 0 258 130
the 0 258 130
criminality 0 258 130
of 0 258 130
our 0 258 130
wars 0 258 130
in 0 258 130
Afghanistan 0 258 130
and 0 258 130
Iraq. 0 258 130

They 1 258 131
had 1 258 131
a 1 258 131
right 1 258 131
to 0 258 131
find 0 258 131
out 0 258 131
about 0 258 131
Cablegate. 0 258 131

That’s 0 258 132
when, 0 258 132
on 0 258 132
Clinton’s 0 258 132
watch, 0 258 132
we 0 258 132
learned 0 258 132
that 0 258 132
the 0 258 132
NSA 0 258 132
was 0 258 132
gathering 0 258 132
personal 0 258 132
information 0 258 132
on 0 258 132
members 0 258 132
of 0 258 132
the 0 258 132
United 0 258 132
Nations 0 258 132
Security 0 258 132
Council, 0 258 132
including 0 258 132
their 0 258 132
credit 0 258 132
card 0 258 132
numbers. 0 258 132

You 0 258 133
can 0 258 133
see 0 258 133
why 0 258 133
Julian 0 258 133
made 0 258 133
enemies. 0 258 133

But 0 258 134
he 0 258 134
should 0 258 134
also 0 258 134
have 0 258 134
made 0 258 134
a 0 258 134
huge 0 258 134
number 0 258 134
of 0 258 134
friends. 0 258 134

This 0 258 135
is 0 258 135
critical 0 258 135
information 0 258 135
because 0 258 135
it 0 258 135
tells 0 258 135
us 0 258 135
how 0 258 135
power 0 258 135
works 0 258 135
and 0 258 135
we 0 258 135
will 0 258 135
never 0 258 135
learn 0 258 135
about 0 258 135
it 0 258 135
otherwise. 0 258 135

I 0 258 136
think 0 258 136
WikiLeaks 0 258 136
has 0 258 136
opened 0 258 136
a 0 258 136
world 0 258 136
of 0 258 136
transparency 0 258 136
and 1 258 136
put 1 258 136
flesh 1 258 136
on 1 258 136
the 1 258 136
expression 1 258 136
“right 0 258 136
to 0 258 136
know.” 0 258 136
This 0 258 136
must 0 258 136
explain 0 258 136
why 0 258 136
he 0 258 136
is 0 258 136
attacked 0 258 136
so 0 258 136
much, 0 258 136
because 0 258 136
that 0 258 136
is 0 258 136
so 0 258 136
threatening. 0 258 136

The 1 258 137
enemy 1 258 137
to 1 258 137
great 1 258 137
power 1 258 137
is 1 258 137
not 1 258 137
the 1 258 137
likes 1 258 137
of 1 258 137
the 1 258 137
Taliban, 1 258 137
it 1 258 137
is 1 258 137
us. 1 258 137

DB: 0 258 138
And 0 258 138
who 0 258 138
can 0 258 138
forget 0 258 138
the 0 258 138
release 0 258 138
of 0 258 138
the 0 258 138
“collateral 0 258 138
murder” 0 258 138
footage 0 258 138
by 0 258 138
Chelsea 0 258 138
Manning? 0 258 138

JP: 0 258 139
That 0 258 139
kind 0 258 139
of 0 258 139
thing 0 258 139
is 0 258 139
not 0 258 139
uncommon. 0 258 139

Vietnam 0 258 140
was 0 258 140
meant 0 258 140
to 0 258 140
be 0 258 140
the 0 258 140
open 0 258 140
war 0 258 140
but 0 258 140
really 0 258 140
it 0 258 140
wasn’t. 0 258 140

There 0 258 141
weren’t 0 258 141
the 0 258 141
cameras 0 258 141
around. 0 258 141

It 0 258 142
is 0 258 142
indeed 0 258 142
shocking 1 258 142
information 1 258 142
but 0 258 142
it 0 258 142
informs 0 258 142
people, 0 258 142
and 0 258 142
we 0 258 142
have 0 258 142
Chelsea 0 258 142
Manning’s 0 258 142
courage 0 258 142
to 0 258 142
thank 0 258 142
for 0 258 142
that. 0 258 142

DB: 0 258 143
Yes, 0 258 143
and 0 258 143
the 0 258 143
thanks 0 258 143
he 0 258 143
got 0 258 143
was 0 258 143
seven 0 258 143
years 0 258 143
in 0 258 143
solitary 0 258 143
confinement. 0 258 143

They 0 258 144
want 0 258 144
to 0 258 144
prosecute 0 258 144
Assange 0 258 144
and 0 258 144
maybe 0 258 144
hang 1 258 144
him 1 258 144
from 1 258 144
the 1 258 144
rafters 1 258 144

is 0 258 145
no 0 258 145
end 0 258 145

Why 1 260 48
are 0 260 48
animals 0 260 48
slaughtered 0 260 48
in 0 260 48
agony 1 260 48

“Why 1 260 50

it 0 260 50

easy, 0 260 50

Why?” 1 260 51
Waters 0 260 51
asked. 0 260 51

Well, 0 260 52
the 0 260 52
questions 0 260 52
are 0 260 52
obviously 0 260 52
rhetorical. 0 260 52

We 0 260 53
know 0 260 53
why. 0 260 53

The 0 260 54
UK 0 260 54
is 0 260 54
frightened 0 260 54
of 0 260 54
the 0 260 54

and 0 260 54
by 0 260 54

they 0 260 54

Kassam 0 260 58
also 0 260 58
spoke 0 260 58
at 0 260 58
the 0 260 58
event, 0 260 58
reminding 0 260 58
supporters 0 260 58
of 0 260 58
what 0 260 58
was 0 260 58
happening 0 260 58
all 0 260 58
across 0 260 58
Europe 0 260 58
due 0 260 58
the 0 260 58
mass 0 260 58
influx 0 260 58
of 0 260 58
Muslim 0 260 58
migrants. 0 260 58

Then 0 260 59
he 0 260 59
encouraged 0 260 59
them 0 260 59
with 0 260 59
a 0 260 59
piece 0 260 59
of 0 260 59
American 0 260 59
history. 0 260 59

“I’m 0 260 60
sure 0 260 60
we 0 260 60
have 0 260 60
some 0 260 60
American 1 260 60
friends 1 260 60
in 0 260 60
the 0 260 60
crowd, 0 260 60
on 0 260 60
stage, 0 260 60
and 0 260 60
watching 0 260 60
at 0 260 60
home,” 0 260 60
Kassam 0 260 60
concluded. 0 260 60

“You 0 260 61
know 0 260 61
there 0 260 61
was 0 260 61
a 0 260 61
man 0 260 61
called 0 260 61
Paul 0 260 61
Revere. 0 260 61

He 0 260 62
rode 0 260 62
through 0 260 62
the 0 260 62
night 0 260 62
on 0 260 62
his 0 260 62
horse. 0 260 62

He 0 260 63
said, 0 260 63
‘The 0 260 63
British 0 260 63
are 0 260 63
coming, 0 260 63
the 0 260 63
British 0 260 63
are 0 260 63
coming!’ 0 260 63
Well, 0 260 63
let 0 260 63
you 0 260 63
tell 0 260 63
you 0 260 63
something; 0 260 63
we’re 0 260 63
here 0 260 63
today 0 260 63
to 0 260 63
say 0 260 63
a 0 260 63
similar 0 260 63
thing: 0 260 63
The 1 260 63
British 1 260 63
are 1 260 63
coming 1 260 63
back!” 1 260 63

I 0 260 64
do 0 260 64
hope 0 260 64
that 0 260 64
is 0 260 64
true, 0 260 64
but 0 260 64
unless 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
Brits 0 260 64
are 0 260 64
going 0 260 64
to 0 260 64
put 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
same 0 260 64
kind 0 260 64
of 0 260 64
fear 0 260 64
in 0 260 64
their 0 260 64
representatives 0 260 64
that 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
Muslims 0 260 64
are 0 260 64
doing, 0 260 64
they 0 260 64
can't 0 260 64
expect 0 260 64
to 0 260 64
do 0 260 64
what 0 260 64
they 0 260 64
want 0 260 64
to 0 260 64
do. 0 260 64

What 0 260 65
Britain 0 260 65
needs 0 260 65
is 0 260 65
a 0 260 65
return 0 260 65
to 0 260 65
the 1 260 65
God 1 260 65
of 1 260 65
their 1 260 65
forefathers, 1 260 65
the 0 260 65
One 0 260 65
Oliver 0 260 65
Cromwell 0 260 65
served. 0 260 65

They 0 260 66
need 0 260 66
to 0 260 66
fear 0 260 66
Him 0 260 66
more 0 260 66
than 0 260 66
they 0 260 66
do 0 260 66
the 0 260 66
Islamic 0 260 66
terrorists 0 260 66
and 0 260 66
rape 0 260 66
gangs. 0 260 66

Then, 1 260 67
and 1 260 67
only 1 260 67
then, 1 260 67
will 0 260 67
they 0 260 67
render 0 260 67
justice 0 260 67

the 0 261 8

unable 0 264 14

How 1 264 42
in 1 264 42
the 1 264 42

can 1 264 42
we 1 264 42

We 0 264 43
see 0 264 43
this 0 264 43

of 0 264 43
corruption 0 264 43
all 0 264 43
over 0 264 43
the 0 264 43

why 0 264 43
should 0 264 43
believe 0 264 43
that 0 264 43
these 0 264 43

could 0 264 43
be 0 264 43

acting 0 264 43
on 0 264 43

There 0 264 44
were 0 264 44
7 0 264 44
of 0 264 44
them 0 264 44
on 0 264 44
the 0 264 44
case, 0 264 44
and 0 264 44
they 0 264 44
were 0 264 44
comfortable 0 264 44
enough 0 264 44
with 0 264 44
each 0 264 44
other 0 264 44
to 0 264 44

none 0 264 44

ever 0 264 44
chastised 0 264 44
the 0 264 44
others 0 264 44
for 0 264 44
expressing 0 264 44
those 0 264 44
biases! 0 264 44

Not 0 264 45
only 0 264 45
that, 0 264 45
the 0 264 45
team 0 264 45
that 0 264 45
handled 0 264 45

poorly 0 264 45

the 0 264 45
Russia 0 264 45
investigation! 0 264 45

Meaning, 0 264 46
the 0 264 46
obviously 0 264 46
politically 0 264 46
biased 0 264 46
team 0 264 46

just 0 264 46
cleared 0 264 46
the 0 264 46

that 0 264 46
they 0 264 46

was 0 264 46
now 0 264 46
tapped 0 264 46

the 0 264 46
man 0 264 46
that 0 264 46
they 0 264 46

was 0 264 46
tied 0 264 46
to 0 264 46

He 0 264 62
writes, 0 264 62
“We 0 264 62

i.e. 0 264 62

notwithstanding 0 264 63
the 0 264 63

we 0 264 63
have 0 264 63
not 0 264 63

a 0 264 63

an 0 264 63

In 0 264 63
other 0 264 63
words, 0 264 63
Hillary 0 264 63
may 0 264 63
have 0 264 63
been 0 264 63
hacked 0 264 63
but 0 264 63
she 0 264 63
didn’t 0 264 63
intentionally 0 264 63
give 0 264 63
anything 0 264 63
away. 0 264 63

Of 0 264 64
course, 0 264 64
the 0 264 64
statute 0 264 64
itself 0 264 64
didn’t 0 264 64
make 0 264 64
intent 0 264 64
a 0 264 64
prerequisite. 0 264 64

Herridge 0 264 65
reports 0 264 65
that 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
House 0 264 65
committee 0 264 65
memo 0 264 65
once 0 264 65
again 0 264 65
raises 0 264 65
this 0 264 65
same 0 264 65
issue: 0 264 65
“Officials 0 264 65
from 0 264 65
both 0 264 65
agencies 0 264 65
have 0 264 65
created 0 264 65
a 0 264 65
perception 0 264 65
they 0 264 65
misinterpreted 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
Espionage 0 264 65
Act 0 264 65
by 0 264 65
stating 0 264 65
Secretary 0 264 65

lacked 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
requisite 0 264 65
‘intent’ 0 264 65
for 0 264 65
charges 0 264 65
to 0 264 65
be 0 264 65
filed,” 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
memo 0 264 65
says, 0 264 65
before 0 264 65
pointing 0 264 65
to 0 264 65
statements 0 264 65
by 0 264 65
Comey 0 264 65
that 0 264 65
indicated 0 264 65
a 0 264 65
belief 0 264 65
that 0 264 65
intent 0 264 65
was 0 264 65
required 0 264 65
— 0 264 65
which 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
memo 0 264 65
says 0 264 65
ignored 0 264 65
“meaningful 0 264 65
aspects” 0 264 65
of 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
law. 0 264 65

It 0 264 66
really 0 264 66
does 0 264 66
seem 0 264 66
that 0 264 66
Strzok, 0 264 66
an 0 264 66
agent 0 264 66
who 0 264 66
had 0 264 66
a 0 264 66
personal 0 264 66
pro-Hillary 0 264 66
bias, 0 264 66
was 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
person 0 264 66
who 0 264 66
pushed 0 264 66
to 0 264 66
let 0 264 66
her 0 264 66
off 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
hook 0 264 66
by 0 264 66
focusing 0 264 66
on 0 264 66
her 0 264 66
intent 0 264 66
rather 0 264 66
than 0 264 66
her 0 264 66
negligence 0 264 66
setting 0 264 66
up 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
server 0 264 66
in 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
first 0 264 66
place. 0 264 66

I 1 264 67
fully 1 264 67
believe 1 264 67
IG 1 264 67
Horowitz’ 1 264 67
findings 1 264 67
here. 0 264 67

I 0 264 68
believe 0 264 68
that 0 264 68
he 0 264 68
was 0 264 68
unable 0 264 68
to 0 264 68
prove 0 264 68
that 0 264 68
there 0 264 68
was 0 264 68
any 0 264 68
political 0 264 68
motive 0 264 68
to 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
FBI’s 0 264 68
handling 0 264 68
of 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
Clinton 0 264 68
email 0 264 68
case, 0 264 68
and 0 264 68
I 0 264 68
believe 0 264 68
that 0 264 68
while 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
case 0 264 68
was 0 264 68
obviously 0 264 68
mishandled, 1 264 68
it 0 264 68
could 0 264 68
have 0 264 68
reached 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
conclusion 0 264 68
it 0 264 68
did 0 264 68
honorably. 0 264 68

However, 0 264 69
I 0 264 69
also 0 264 69
think 0 264 69
that 0 264 69
the 0 264 69
IG 0 264 69
has 0 264 69
purposely 0 264 69
left 0 264 69
room 0 264 69
in 0 264 69
his 0 264 69
conclusion 0 264 69
to 0 264 69
amend 0 264 69
that 0 264 69
decision 0 264 69
after 0 264 69
he’s 0 264 69
concluded 0 264 69
his 0 264 69
Russia 0 264 69
investigation. 0 264 69

In 0 264 70
fact, 0 264 70
there 0 264 70
are 0 264 70
already 0 264 70
signs 0 264 70
of 0 264 70
him 0 264 70
doing 0 264 70
that 0 264 70
in 0 264 70
this 0 264 70
report. 0 264 70

Much 0 264 71
of 0 264 71
the 0 264 71
information 0 264 71
that 0 264 71
he 0 264 71
uses 0 264 71
to 0 264 71
chastise 0 264 71
Strzok’s 0 264 71
behavior 0 264 71
and 0 264 71
judgment 0 264 71
in 0 264 71
the 0 264 71
Clinton 0 264 71
email 0 264 71
case, 0 264 71
would 0 264 71
have 0 264 71
actually 0 264 71
come 0 264 71
from 0 264 71
his 0 264 71
current 0 264 71
investigation 0 264 71
into 0 264 71
the 0 264 71
Russia 0 264 71
mess. 0 264 71

It’s 0 264 72
quite 0 264 72
possible 0 264 72
that 0 264 72
as 0 264 72
bad 0 264 72
as 0 264 72
this 0 264 72
report 0 264 72
is 0 264 72
for 0 264 72
Comey, 0 264 72
Strzok, 0 264 72
Page, 0 264 72
and 0 264 72
Obama’s 0 264 72
FBI 0 264 72
leadership… 0 264 72
Horowitz’ 0 264 72
conclusion 0 264 72
in 0 264 72
the 0 264 72
Russia 0 264 72
investigation 0 264 72
could 0 264 72
prove 0 264 72
to 0 264 72
be 0 264 72
even 1 264 72
worse. 1 264 72

how 0 75 17
these 0 75 17

Berg 0 75 18

the 0 75 18

Does 0 75 19
Berg 0 75 19
and 0 75 19
the 0 75 19
AMA 0 75 19
support 0 75 19
our 1 75 19
military? 0 75 19

Do 0 75 20
they 0 75 20
not 0 75 20
know 0 75 20
that 0 75 20
18-year-olds 0 75 20
carry 0 75 20

both 0 75 20
handguns 0 75 20
and 0 75 20
rifles? 0 75 20

I 0 75 21
ask, 0 75 21
as 0 75 21
I 0 75 21
do 0 75 21
with 0 75 21
the 0 75 21
issue 0 75 21
concerning 0 75 21
alcohol, 0 75 21
what 0 75 21
is 0 75 21
magic 0 75 21
about 0 75 21
the 0 75 21
age 0 75 21
of 0 75 21
21? 0 75 21

I 0 75 22
ask, 0 75 22
where 0 75 22
does 0 75 22
government 0 75 22
get 0 75 22
to 0 75 22
determine 0 75 22
who 0 75 22
gets 0 75 22
to 0 75 22
do 0 75 22
whatever 0 75 22
at 0 75 22
whatever 0 75 22
age 0 75 22
based 0 75 22
on 0 75 22
an 0 75 22
ambiguous 0 75 22
age 0 75 22
number? 0 75 22

Yet, 0 75 23
if 1 75 23
we 1 75 23
do 1 75 23
that, 1 75 23
we 1 75 23
won't 1 75 23
have 1 75 23
to 1 75 23
worry 1 75 23
about 1 75 23
mass 1 75 23
shooters, 1 75 23
right? 0 75 23

Wrong. 0 75 24

Yeah, 0 75 25
that's 0 75 25
gonna 0 75 25
keep 0 75 25
people 0 75 25
safe. 0 75 25

It's 0 75 26
going 0 75 26
to 0 75 26
infringe 0 75 26
on 0 75 26
the 0 75 26
rights 0 75 26
of 0 75 26
those 0 75 26
who 0 75 26
don't 0 75 26
commit 0 75 26
crimes 0 75 26
and 0 75 26
need 0 75 26
a 0 75 26
gun 0 75 26
to 0 75 26
protect 0 75 26
themselves 0 75 26

the 0 75 26
constitutional 0 75 26

The 0 75 27
AMA 0 75 27
also 0 75 27
wants 0 75 27
to 0 75 27
bypass 0 75 27
the 0 75 27
Fifth 0 75 27
Amendment 0 75 27

liberty 0 75 27
and 0 75 27
property 0 75 27
as 0 75 27
they 0 75 27
promote 0 75 27
a 0 75 27
new 0 75 27
legal 0 75 27
procedure 0 75 27
by 0 75 27
which 0 75 27
“family 0 75 27

can 0 75 27

They 0 75 28
want 0 75 28
to 0 75 28
do 0 75 28
what 0 75 28
President 0 75 28

due 0 75 28
process. 0 75 28

See? 0 75 29

This 0 75 30
is 0 75 30
why 0 75 30
they 0 75 30
should 0 75 30
be 0 75 30
honest 0 75 30
about 0 75 30
who 0 75 30

I'm 0 75 31
all 0 75 31
for 0 75 31
situations 0 75 31
like 0 75 31
Nikolas 0 75 31

tried 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
dealt 0 75 31
with 0 75 31
lawfully, 0 75 31
but 0 75 31
to 0 75 31
go 0 75 31

the 0 75 31

of 0 75 31
another 0 75 31

anti-constitutional 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
anti-American. 1 75 31

Who 0 75 32
knows 0 75 32
exactly 0 75 32
what 0 75 32
they 0 75 32
mean 0 75 32
by 0 75 32
high-capacity 0 75 32
magazines. 0 75 32

I 0 75 33
mean, 0 75 33
for 0 75 33
the 0 75 33
most 0 75 33
part, 0 75 33
you 0 75 33
can 0 75 33

In 0 75 34
some 0 75 34
cases, 0 75 34
you 0 75 34
can 0 75 34
purchase 0 75 34
drums 0 75 34
which 0 75 34
hold 0 75 34
50-100 0 75 34

for 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
nonsensical 1 75 35

Newly 0 75 45
adopted 0 75 45
policy 0 75 45
also 0 75 45
means 0 75 45
the 0 75 45
AMA 0 75 45
will: 0 75 45

Advocate 0 75 46

oppose 0 75 48
concealed 0 75 48
carry 0 75 48
reciprocity, 0 75 48
which 0 75 48
I 0 75 48
do 0 75 48
as 0 75 48
well, 0 75 48
but 0 75 48
based 0 75 48
on 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
principle 0 75 48
that 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
Second 0 75 48
Amendment's 0 75 48
protections 0 75 48
extend 0 75 48
to 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
various 0 75 48
states 0 75 48
as 0 75 48
well, 0 75 48
since 0 75 48
it 0 75 48
recognizes 0 75 48
a 1 75 48
right, 1 75 48
not 1 75 48
a 1 75 48

arms. 1 75 48

I 0 75 49
also 0 75 49
oppose 0 75 49
it 0 75 49
because 0 75 49
it's 0 75 49
just 0 75 49
another 0 75 49
step 0 75 49
for 0 75 49
the 0 75 49
federal 0 75 49
government 0 75 49
to 0 75 49
say 0 75 49
they 0 75 49
need 0 75 49
a 0 75 49
database 0 75 49
so 0 75 49
states 0 75 49
can 0 75 49
check, 0 75 49
thus 0 75 49
identifying 0 75 49
gun 0 75 49

— 0 268 22
after 1 268 22

enabled 1 268 22
the 1 268 22

of 1 268 22
wartime 1 268 22

Last 0 268 23
October, 0 268 23
the 0 268 23

Broadcasting 0 268 23
Corporation 0 268 23
journalist 0 268 23
Sarah 0 268 23
Ferguson 0 268 23
interviewed 0 268 23
Hillary 0 268 23
Clinton, 0 268 23
over 1 268 23
whom 1 268 23
she 1 268 23
fawned 1 268 23
as 0 268 23
“the 1 268 23
icon 1 268 23
for 1 268 23
your 1 268 23
generation”. 1 268 23

This 0 268 24
was 0 268 24
the 0 268 24
same 0 268 24
Clinton 0 268 24
who 0 268 24
threatened 0 268 24
to 0 268 24
“obliterate 1 268 24
totally” 1 268 24
Iran 0 268 24
and, 0 268 24
who, 0 268 24
as 0 268 24
U.S. 0 268 24
secretary 0 268 24
of 0 268 24
State 0 268 24
in 0 268 24
2011, 0 268 24
was 0 268 24
one 1 268 24
of 1 268 24
the 1 268 24
instigators 1 268 24
of 1 268 24
the 1 268 24
invasion 1 268 24
and 1 268 24
destruction 1 268 24
of 1 268 24
Libya 1 268 24
as 1 268 24
a 1 268 24
modern 1 268 24
state, 1 268 24
with 0 268 24
the 0 268 24
loss 0 268 24
of 0 268 24
40,000 0 268 24
lives. 0 268 24

Like 1 268 25
the 1 268 25
invasion 1 268 25
of 1 268 25
Iraq, 1 268 25
it 1 268 25
was 1 268 25
based 1 268 25
on 1 268 25
lies. 1 268 25

When 0 268 26
the 0 268 26
Libyan 0 268 26
President 0 268 26
was 0 268 26
murdered 1 268 26
publicly 1 268 26
and 1 268 26
gruesomely 1 268 26
with 0 268 26
a 0 268 26
knife, 0 268 26
Clinton 0 268 26
was 0 268 26
filmed 0 268 26
whooping 1 268 26
and 1 268 26
cheering. 1 268 26

Thanks 1 268 27
largely 1 268 27
to 1 268 27
her, 1 268 27
Libya 1 268 27
became 1 268 27
a 1 268 27
breeding 1 268 27
ground 1 268 27
for 1 268 27
ISIS 1 268 27

that 1 268 78

to 0 268 85

Malcolm 1 268 89

you 0 270 12
on 0 270 12

Horowitz 0 270 12
said, 0 270 12
and 0 270 12
the 0 270 12
IG 0 270 12
was 0 270 12
“not 0 270 12

Horowitz 0 270 14
“would 0 270 14

Rep. 0 270 15
King 0 270 15

about 0 270 15
his 0 270 15
first 0 270 15
encounter 0 270 15
with 0 270 15
the 0 270 15
switch 0 270 15
of 0 270 15
“extremely 1 270 15
careless” 1 270 15
for 0 270 15
‘gross 1 270 15
negligence,” 1 270 15
which 0 270 15
violated 0 270 15
a 0 270 15
criminal 0 270 15
statute. 0 270 15

Horowitz 0 270 16
found 0 270 16
that 0 270 16
Peter 0 270 16

Lisa 0 270 16
Page, 0 270 16
and 0 270 16
James 0 270 16
Comey 0 270 16
were 0 270 16
all 0 270 16
involved. 0 270 16

The 0 270 17
IG 0 270 17
also 0 270 17
said 0 270 17
his 0 270 17
team 0 270 17
focused 0 270 17
on 0 270 17
the 0 270 17
fact 0 270 17
that 0 270 17
the 0 270 17
classified 0 270 17
material 0 270 17
on 0 270 17
Clinton’s 0 270 17
server 0 270 17
was 0 270 17
“not 0 270 17
clearly 0 270 17
marked,” 0 270 17
which 0 270 17
repeated 0 270 17
one 0 270 17
of 0 270 17
Clinton’s 0 270 17
claims 0 270 17
about 0 270 17

negligence. 1 270 17

As 0 270 18
for 0 270 18
the 0 270 18
question 0 270 18
of 0 270 18
her 0 270 18
“intent,” 0 270 18
Horowitz 0 270 18
said 0 270 18
it 0 270 18
arose 0 270 18
“months 0 270 18
earlier,” 0 270 18
maybe 0 270 18
in 0 270 18
2015, 0 270 18
though 0 270 18
he 0 270 18
couldn’t 0 270 18
be 0 270 18
sure. 0 270 18

King 0 270 19
said 0 270 19
President 0 270 19
Obama 0 270 19
had 0 270 19
suggested 0 270 19
the 0 270 19
“careless 0 270 19
but 0 270 19
not 0 270 19
intentional” 0 270 19
language 0 270 19
in 0 270 19
a 0 270 19

in 0 270 19
October 0 270 19

2015. 0 270 19

And 0 270 20
King 0 270 20
had 0 270 20
observed 0 270 20
that 0 270 20
in 0 270 20
his 0 270 20
July 0 270 20
5, 0 270 20
2016 0 270 20
statement, 0 270 20
James 0 270 20
Comey 0 270 20
used 0 270 20
“intent” 0 270 20
six 0 270 20
times. 0 270 20

Horowitz 0 270 21
said 0 270 21
Comey 0 270 21
“concealed 0 270 21

The 0 270 21

“thorough, 0 270 21

Rep. 0 270 23
James 0 270 23
Jordan 0 270 23
asked 0 270 23
Horowitz 0 270 23
when 0 270 23
his 0 270 23
team 0 270 23
had 0 270 23

the 0 270 23
message 0 270 23
about 0 270 23
“we’ll 0 270 23
stop” 0 270 23
Trump. 0 270 23

Horowitz 0 270 24
conceded 0 270 24
that 0 270 24
this 0 270 24
meant 0 270 24
“stop 0 270 24
Trump 0 270 24
from 0 270 24
becoming 0 270 24
president.” 0 270 24
The 0 270 24
IG 0 270 24
said 0 270 24
they 0 270 24
uncovered 0 270 24
that 0 270 24
text 0 270 24
in 0 270 24
May, 0 270 24
and 0 270 24
Jordan 0 270 24
asked 0 270 24

that 0 270 25

Rosenstein’s 0 270 25
department 0 270 25
at 0 270 25
the 0 270 25

Jordan 0 270 26
concluded 0 270 26
that 0 270 26
Rosenstein 0 270 26

Several 0 270 27

“The 0 270 28

who 0 270 30
charged 0 270 30
that 0 270 30

the 0 270 30

“How 0 270 31

explained 0 270 32
that 0 270 32

allowed 0 270 32

the 0 270 33

of 0 270 33
the 0 270 33
day 0 270 33
it 0 270 33
was 0 270 33
evident 0 270 33
that 0 270 33
Congress 0 270 33

“There 0 271 30

“It 0 271 36
seems 0 271 36
altogether 0 271 36
fitting 0 271 36
and 0 271 36
proper 0 271 36

Edmund 0 271 36

coined 0 271 36
the 0 271 36

The 0 271 36
year 0 271 36
was 0 271 36
1787—the 0 271 36
year 0 271 36
the 0 271 36
U.S. 0 271 36
Constitution 0 271 36
was 0 271 36
adopted. 0 271 36

The 0 271 37
First 0 271 37
Amendment, 0 271 37
approved 0 271 37
four 0 271 37
years 0 271 37
later, 0 271 37
aimed 0 271 37
at 0 271 37
ensuring 0 271 37
that 0 271 37
the 0 271 37
press 0 271 37
would 0 271 37
be 0 271 37
free 0 271 37
of 0 271 37
government 0 271 37
interference. 0 271 37

That 0 271 38
was 0 271 38
then. 0 271 38

With 0 271 39
the 0 271 39
Fourth 1 271 39
Estate 1 271 39
now 1 271 39

on 0 271 39

Small 1 271 40

that 0 271 40

free.” 0 271 41
WikiLeaks 0 271 41
is 0 271 41
helping 0 271 41
make 0 271 41
that 0 271 41
possible 0 271 41

Last 0 271 42
spring, 0 271 42
when 0 271 42
we 0 271 42

Julian 0 271 42
Assange 0 271 42
for 0 271 42
this 0 271 42
award, 0 271 42
Julian 0 271 42
said 0 271 42
he 0 271 42
would 0 271 42
accept 0 271 42
only 0 271 42
“on 0 271 42

of 0 271 43
July 0 271 43
12, 0 271 43
2007 0 271 43
called 0 271 43
“Collateral 0 271 43
Murder.” 0 271 43
Whoever 0 271 43
did 0 271 43
provide 0 271 43
that 0 271 43
graphic 0 271 43
footage, 0 271 43
showing 0 271 43
the 1 271 43
brutality 1 271 43
of 1 271 43
the 1 271 43
celebrated 1 271 43
“surge” 1 271 43
in 1 271 43
Iraq, 1 271 43
was 0 271 43
certainly 0 271 43
far 1 271 43
more 1 271 43
a 1 271 43
patriot 1 271 43
than 0 271 43
the 1 271 43
“mainstream” 1 271 43
journalist 1 271 43
embedded 0 271 43
in 0 271 43
that 0 271 43
same 0 271 43
Army 0 271 43
unit. 0 271 43

He 0 271 44
suppressed 0 271 44
what 0 271 44
happened 0 271 44
in 0 271 44
Baghdad 0 271 44
that 0 271 44
day, 0 271 44
dismissed 0 271 44
it 0 271 44
as 0 271 44
simply 0 271 44
“one 1 271 44
bad 1 271 44
day 1 271 44
in 1 271 44
a 1 271 44
surge 1 271 44
that 1 271 44
was 1 271 44
filled 1 271 44
with 1 271 44
such 1 271 44
days,” 1 271 44
and 0 271 44
then 0 271 44
had 1 271 44
the 1 271 44
temerity 1 271 44
to 1 271 44
lavish 1 271 44
praise 1 271 44
on 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
unit 0 271 44
in 0 271 44
a 0 271 44
book 0 271 44
he 0 271 44
called 0 271 44
“The 0 271 44
Good 0 271 44
Soldiers.” 0 271 44
Julian 0 271 44
is 0 271 44
right 0 271 44
to 0 271 44
emphasize 0 271 44
that 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
world 0 271 44
is 0 271 44
deeply 0 271 44
indebted 0 271 44
to 0 271 44
patriotic 1 271 44
truth-tellers 1 271 44
like 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
sources 0 271 44
who 0 271 44
provided 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
gun-barrel 0 271 44
footage 0 271 44
and 0 271 44
the 0 271 44

have 0 271 45

chance 0 271 45

in 0 271 45
the 0 271 45

Today 0 271 46
we 0 271 46
honor 0 271 46
WikiLeaks, 0 271 46
and 0 271 46
one 0 271 46
of 0 271 46
its 0 271 46
leaders, 0 271 46
Julian 0 271 46
Assange, 0 271 46
for 0 271 46
their 0 271 46
ingenuity 0 271 46
in 0 271 46
creating 0 271 46
a 0 271 46
new 0 271 46
highway 0 271 46
by 0 271 46
which 0 271 46
important 0 271 46
documentary 0 271 46
evidence 0 271 46
can 0 271 46
make 0 271 46
its 0 271 46
way, 0 271 46
quickly 0 271 46
and 0 271 46
confidentially, 0 271 46
through 0 271 46
the 0 271 46
ether 0 271 46
and 0 271 46
into 0 271 46
our 0 271 46
in-boxes. 0 271 46

Long 1 271 47
live 1 271 47
the 1 271 47
Fifth 1 271 47
Estate!” 1 271 47

Eventually 0 271 48
a 0 271 48
compromise 0 271 48
was 0 271 48
found 0 271 48
in 0 271 48
1971 0 271 48
when 0 271 48
Pope 0 271 48
Paul 0 271 48
VI 0 271 48
lifted 0 271 48
the 0 271 48
excommunications 0 271 48
and 0 271 48
Mindszenty 0 271 48
was 0 271 48
able 0 271 48
to 0 271 48
leave 0 271 48
the 0 271 48
U.S. 0 271 48
embassy. 0 271 48

Can 0 271 49
such 0 271 49
a 0 271 49
diplomatic 0 271 49
solution 0 271 49
be 0 271 49
found 0 271 49
to 0 271 49
free 0 271 49

It 0 271 50
is 0 271 50
looking 0 271 50

the 0 272 2
crackdown 0 272 2
on 0 272 2
illegals 0 272 2
entering 0 272 2
the 0 272 2
country, 0 272 2
especially 0 272 2
since 0 272 2
it 0 272 2
was 0 272 2
one 0 272 2
of 0 272 2
the 0 272 2

When 0 272 3
it 0 272 3
comes 0 272 3
to 0 272 3
the 0 272 3
separation 0 272 3
of 0 272 3
children 0 272 3
from 0 272 3
their 0 272 3
families, 0 272 3
there 0 272 3
is 0 272 3
nothing 0 272 3
new 0 272 3
today 0 272 3
that 0 272 3
was 0 272 3
not 0 272 3
being 0 272 3
done 0 272 3
during 0 272 3
the 0 272 3
Obama 0 272 3
reign. 0 272 3

In 0 272 4
2013, 0 272 4
Obama 0 272 4
began 0 272 4
bringing 0 272 4
into 0 272 4
the 0 272 4
US 0 272 4
literally 0 272 4
over 0 272 4
a 0 272 4
hundred 0 272 4

people, 0 272 4
mainly 0 272 4
below 0 272 4
age 0 272 4
21. 0 272 4

They 0 272 5
were 0 272 5
bused, 0 272 5
flown, 0 272 5
and 0 272 5
met 0 272 5
at 0 272 5
the 0 272 5
US 0 272 5
border 0 272 5
with 0 272 5
Mexico 0 272 5

of 0 272 5
Obama 0 272 5
to 0 272 5

so. 0 272 5

Since 0 272 6
most 0 272 6

could 0 272 6
not 0 272 6
be 0 272 6
set 0 272 6
free, 0 272 6
thus 0 272 6
Obama 0 272 6
ordered 0 272 6

The 0 272 17
surge 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
children 0 272 17
into 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
US 0 272 17
from 0 272 17
various 0 272 17
countries 0 272 17
south 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
border 0 272 17
was 0 272 17
said 0 272 17
to 0 272 17
be 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
result 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
economics, 0 272 17
high 0 272 17
crime 0 272 17
rates, 0 272 17
and 0 272 17
actual 0 272 17
threats 0 272 17
from 0 272 17
organized 0 272 17
crime 0 272 17
entities. 0 272 17

Another 0 272 18
excuse 1 272 18
used 0 272 18
by 0 272 18
the 0 272 18
Obama 0 272 18
government 0 272 18
was 0 272 18
to 0 272 18
bring 0 272 18
them 0 272 18
here 0 272 18
to 0 272 18
find 0 272 18
their 0 272 18
families 0 272 18
already 0 272 18
in 0 272 18
the 0 272 18
US. 0 272 18

Thus, 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
idea 0 272 19
that 0 272 19
separating 1 272 19
children 0 272 19
from 0 272 19
their 0 272 19
parents 0 272 19
as 0 272 19
being 0 272 19
something 0 272 19
new, 0 272 19
done 0 272 19
only 0 272 19
by 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
Trump 0 272 19
Administration 0 272 19
is 0 272 19
absurd, 1 272 19
since 0 272 19
we 0 272 19
really 0 272 19
have 0 272 19
no 0 272 19
idea 0 272 19
whether 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
children 0 272 19
brought 0 272 19
here 0 272 19
during 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
Obama 0 272 19
reign 0 272 19
were 0 272 19
intentionally 0 272 19
separated 1 272 19
from 0 272 19
their 0 272 19
parents 0 272 19
by 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
US 0 272 19
government 0 272 19
at 0 272 19
that 0 272 19
time, 0 272 19
or 0 272 19
not. 0 272 19

We 0 272 20
have 0 272 20
only 0 272 20
what 0 272 20
little 0 272 20
information 0 272 20
the 0 272 20
government 0 272 20
told 0 272 20
us 0 272 20
then, 0 272 20
which 0 272 20
was 0 272 20
not 0 272 20
very 0 272 20
much, 0 272 20
considering 0 272 20
the 0 272 20
fact 0 272 20
that 0 272 20
Obama 0 272 20
wanted 0 272 20
to 0 272 20
keep 0 272 20
as 0 272 20
much 0 272 20
of 0 272 20
this 0 272 20
situation 0 272 20
as 0 272 20
secret 0 272 20
as 0 272 20
possible. 0 272 20

What 0 272 21
many 0 272 21
do 0 272 21
not 0 272 21
realize 0 272 21
is, 0 272 21
today's 0 272 21
policy 0 272 21
of 0 272 21
separating 1 272 21
underage 0 272 21
siblings 0 272 21
from 0 272 21
their 0 272 21
parents 0 272 21
once 0 272 21
they 0 272 21
cross 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
border 0 272 21
illegally 0 272 21
into 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
US 0 272 21
seems 0 272 21
to 0 272 21
be 0 272 21
a 0 272 21
planned 0 272 21
event 0 272 21
by 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
US 0 272 21
government 0 272 21
going 0 272 21
all 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
way 0 272 21
back 0 272 21
to 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
domestic 0 272 21
military 0 272 21
exercises 0 272 21
known 0 272 21
as 0 272 21
Jade 0 272 21
Helm 0 272 21
in 0 272 21
2015. 0 272 21

Many 0 272 22
remember 0 272 22
the 0 272 22
military 0 272 22
taking 0 272 22
over 0 272 22
several 0 272 22
Walmart 0 272 22
locations, 0 272 22
mainly 0 272 22
in 0 272 22
Texas, 0 272 22
during 0 272 22
the 0 272 22
Jade 0 272 22
Helm 0 272 22
exercises. 0 272 22

This, 0 272 23
along 0 272 23
with 0 272 23
the 0 272 23
federal 0 272 23
government 0 272 23
grab 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
millions 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
acres 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
land 0 272 23
during 0 272 23
the 0 272 23
Obama 0 272 23
years, 0 272 23
speaks 0 272 23
volumes 0 272 23
in 0 272 23
the 0 272 23
government's 0 272 23
plan 0 272 23
to 0 272 23
be 0 272 23
able 0 272 23
to 0 272 23
handle 0 272 23
millions 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
people. 0 272 23

Since 0 272 24
Obama 0 272 24
planned 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
have 0 272 24
over 0 272 24
a 0 272 24
million 0 272 24
Muslim 0 272 24
refugees 0 272 24
brought 0 272 24
into 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
US 0 272 24
over 0 272 24
a 0 272 24
short 0 272 24
period 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
time, 0 272 24
along 0 272 24
with 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
hundreds 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
thousands 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
illegal 0 272 24
immigrants 0 272 24
coming 0 272 24
in, 0 272 24
one 0 272 24
can 0 272 24
understand 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
reason 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
Feds 0 272 24
had 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
have 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
Walmart 0 272 24
stores 0 272 24
and 0 272 24
so 0 272 24
much 0 272 24
land, 0 272 24
as 0 272 24
they 0 272 24
needed 0 272 24
housing 0 272 24
for 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
millions 0 272 24
they 0 272 24
planned 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
bring 0 272 24
in. 0 272 24

Despite 0 272 25
President 0 272 25
Trump 0 272 25
signing 0 272 25
an 0 272 25
Executive 0 272 25
Order 0 272 25
suspending 0 272 25
Syrian 0 272 25
refugees 0 272 25
from 0 272 25
entering 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
US 0 272 25
for 0 272 25
120 0 272 25
days 0 272 25
on 0 272 25
Jan. 0 272 25
26, 0 272 25
2017 0 272 25
while 0 272 25
security 0 272 25
measures 0 272 25
were 0 272 25
reviewed, 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
US 0 272 25
still 0 272 25
imported 0 272 25
110,000 0 272 25
refugees 0 272 25
from 0 272 25
Syria 0 272 25
and 0 272 25
various 0 272 25
other 0 272 25
countries 0 272 25
into 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
US 0 272 25
in 0 272 25
2017 0 272 25
alone, 0 272 25
up 0 272 25
from 0 272 25
85,000 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
previous 0 272 25
year. 0 272 25

These 0 272 26
numbers 0 272 26
follow 0 272 26
Obama's 0 272 26
projections 0 272 26
of 0 272 26
the 0 272 26
expected 0 272 26
amount 0 272 26
of 0 272 26
refugees 0 272 26
permitted 0 272 26
to 0 272 26
come 0 272 26
to 0 272 26
the 0 272 26
US. 0 272 26

Of 0 272 27
course, 0 272 27
as 0 272 27
with 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
number 0 272 27
of 0 272 27
illegal 0 272 27
immigrants 0 272 27
entering 0 272 27
our 0 272 27
county, 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
Feds 0 272 27
downplay 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
actual 0 272 27
number 0 272 27
which 0 272 27
always 0 272 27
ends 0 272 27
up 0 272 27
to 0 272 27
be 0 272 27
more 0 272 27
than 0 272 27
quadruple 0 272 27
their 0 272 27
stated 0 272 27
number. 0 272 27

What 0 272 28
we 0 272 28
seem 0 272 28
to 0 272 28
have 0 272 28
here 0 272 28
with 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
illegal 0 272 28
immigration 0 272 28
situation 0 272 28
today 0 272 28
is 0 272 28
some 1 272 28
very 1 272 28
good 1 272 28
actors 1 272 28
on 1 272 28
the 1 272 28
Left 1 272 28
accusing 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
Trump 0 272 28
Administration 0 272 28
of 0 272 28
being 0 272 28
cruel 1 272 28
and 0 272 28
insensitive 1 272 28
with 0 272 28
separating 1 272 28
children 0 272 28
from 0 272 28
their 0 272 28
families 0 272 28
once 0 272 28
they 0 272 28
cross 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
Mexican 0 272 28
border 0 272 28
into 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
US. 0 272 28

When 0 272 29
in 0 272 29
fact, 0 272 29
their 0 272 29
idol, 1 272 29
Obama 0 272 29
did 0 272 29
the 0 272 29
same 0 272 29
thing 0 272 29
for 0 272 29
years 0 272 29
during 0 272 29
his 0 272 29
time 0 272 29
in 0 272 29
power. 0 272 29

What 0 272 30
they 0 272 30
do 0 272 30
not 0 272 30
want 0 272 30
to 0 272 30
admit 0 272 30
to 0 272 30
is 0 272 30
the 0 272 30

“Some 0 273 31

a 0 273 31
new 0 273 31

We 0 273 32
used 0 273 32
to 0 273 32
think 0 273 32
that 0 273 32

clothes, 0 273 32

lifestyle, 0 273 32
but 0 273 32
the 1 273 32
vogue 1 273 32
today 1 273 32
is 1 273 32
to 0 273 32
sympathize 0 273 32
with 0 273 32
the 0 273 32
Jews 0 273 32

sorrows, 1 273 32
their 1 273 32
heresy, 1 273 32
and 1 273 32
their 1 273 32
historical 1 273 32
lies. 1 273 32

This 0 273 33
is, 0 273 33
indeed, 0 273 33
a 0 273 33
new 0 273 33
fashion. 1 273 33

Some 0 273 34
esteemed 0 273 34
people 0 273 34

tears 0 273 34
about 0 273 34
what 1 273 34
the 1 273 34
Jews 1 273 34
call 1 273 34
‘the 1 273 34
Holocaust.’ 1 273 34
[…] 0 273 34
“Did 0 273 34
the 0 273 34
Nazi 0 273 34
annihilation 1 273 34
– 0 273 34
the 0 273 34
Holocaust 0 273 34
– 0 273 34
target 0 273 34
only 0 273 34
the 0 273 34
Jews? 0 273 34

Anybody? 0 273 35

The 1 273 36
Jews 1 273 36
claim 1 273 36
that 1 273 36
it 1 273 36
happened 1 273 36
to 1 273 36
them 1 273 36
alone 1 273 36
and 1 273 36
that 1 273 36
the 1 273 36
number 1 273 36
of 1 273 36
Jews 1 273 36
who 1 273 36
died 1 273 36
in 1 273 36
that 1 273 36
Holocaust 1 273 36
was 1 273 36
six 1 273 36
million. 1 273 36

What 1 273 37
we 1 273 37
have 1 273 37
here 1 273 37
are 1 273 37
historical 1 273 37
errors. 1 273 37

First 0 273 38
of 0 273 38
all, 0 273 38
the 0 273 38
figure 0 273 38
of 0 273 38
six 0 273 38
million 0 273 38
is 0 273 38
a 0 273 38
historical 1 273 38
lie. 1 273 38

In 0 273 39
addition, 0 273 39
claiming 1 273 39
that 1 273 39
it 1 273 39
happened 1 273 39
to 1 273 39
the 1 273 39
Jews 1 273 39
alone 1 273 39
excludes 1 273 39
the 1 273 39
non-Jews 1 273 39
who 1 273 39
were 1 273 39
tortured 1 273 39
by 1 273 39
Hitler. 1 273 39

So 0 273 40
was 0 273 40
it 0 273 40
annihilation? 1 273 40

Yes, 0 273 41
it 0 273 41
was. 0 273 41

Who 0 273 42
did 0 273 42
Hitler 0 273 42
annihilate? 1 273 42

He 0 273 43
annihilated 1 273 43
a 0 273 43
group 0 273 43
of 0 273 43
races 0 273 43
and 0 273 43
people, 0 273 43
some 0 273 43
of 0 273 43
whom 0 273 43
were 0 273 43
even 0 273 43
German. 0 273 43

Hitler 0 273 44
annihilated 1 273 44
400,000 0 273 44
Germans 0 273 44

or 0 273 44
suffered 0 273 44
from 0 273 44
chronic 0 273 44
diseases. 0 273 44

Hitler 0 273 45
did 0 273 45
not 0 273 45
annihilate 1 273 45
the 0 273 45
Jews 0 273 45
only. 0 273 45

of 1 273 47
many 1 273 47
in 1 273 47
the 1 273 47
West. 1 273 47

Hitler 0 273 48
embodies 0 273 48
one 0 273 48
type 0 273 48
of 0 273 48
modern 1 273 48
Western 1 273 48
annihilation. 1 273 48

When 1 273 49
the 1 273 49
Americans 1 273 49
occupied 1 273 49
the 1 273 49
republics 1 273 49
of 1 273 49
the 1 273 49
Indians, 1 273 49
they 1 273 49
annihilated 1 273 49
millions 1 273 49

human 1 273 49
beings. 1 273 49

It 1 273 50

that 1 273 50
they 1 273 50
annihilated 1 273 50
50-100 1 273 50

nobody 1 273 50
ever 1 273 50
mentions 1 273 50
this. 1 273 50

[…] 0 273 51
“Was 0 273 51
there 0 273 51
annihilation? 1 273 51

Yes. 0 273 52

Many 0 273 53
races 0 273 53
were 0 273 53
annihilated. 1 273 53

The 0 273 54
Auschwitz 0 273 54

which 0 273 54
is 0 273 54
in 0 273 54

detention, 0 273 54
torture, 0 273 54

Many 0 273 55

No, 1 273 59
it 1 273 59
never 1 273 59
happened. 1 273 59

Hitler 0 273 60
and 0 273 60
the 0 273 60
Nazi 0 273 60
state 0 273 60
knew 0 273 60
the 0 273 60
truth 0 273 60
about 0 273 60
the 0 273 60
Jews, 0 273 60
and 0 273 60
therefore, 0 273 60
they 0 273 60
began 0 273 60
tormenting 1 273 60
