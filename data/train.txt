after 0
telling 0

were 0

held 0
by 0
Columbia 0
Asian 0
American 0

on 0
Friday 0
night. 0

Patel, 0
32, 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
Indian-American 0
writer 0
for 0
SNL, 0
and 0
has 0
since 0
been 0
nominated 0
for 0
an 0
Emmy 0
Award 0
for 0
Outstanding 0
Writing. 0

Patel 0
has 0
previously 0
performed 0
on 0
Late 0
Night 0
with 0
Seth 0
Meyers 0
and 0
opened 0
for 0
comedians 0
such 0
as 0
Chris 0
Rock. 0

During 0
the 0
event, 0
Patel’s 0
performance 0
featured 0
commentary 0
on 0
his 0
experience 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
diverse 0
area 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
City—including 0
a 0
joke 0
about 0
a 0
gay, 0
black 0
man 0
in 0
his 0
neighborhood—which 0
AAA 0
officials 0
deemed 0
inappropriate. 0

Patel 0
joked 0
that 0
being 0
gay 0
cannot 0
be 0
a 0
choice 0
because 0
“no 1
one 1
looks 1
in 1
the 1
mirror 1
and 1
thinks, 1
‘this 1
black 1
thing 1
is 1
too 1
easy, 1
let 1
me 1
just 1
add 1
another 1
thing 1
to 1
it.’” 0

That's 0
what 0
Columbia 1
snowflakes 1
thought 0
was 0
offensive. 0

I 0
can't 0
imagine 0
what 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
made 0
of 0
Richard 0
Pryor, 0
or 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
even, 0
Chris 0
Rock. 0

It's 0
also 0
a 0
version 0
of 0
a 0
Sammy 0
Davis 0
Jr 0
joke 0
about 0
converting 0
to 0
Judaism. 0

Which 0
is 0
now 0
a 0
hate 0
crime. 0

About 0
30 0
minutes 0
into 0
Patel’s 0
set, 0
members 0
of 0
AAA 0
interrupted 0
the 0
performance, 0
denounced 0
his 0
jokes 0
about 0
racial 0
identities 0
and 0
sexual 0
orientation, 0
and 0
provided 0
him 0
with 0
a 0
few 0
moments 0
for 0
closing 0
remarks. 0

Comrades, 1
these 1
jokes 1
you 1
have 1
been 1
listening 1
to 1
are 1
thought 1
crimes! 1

Patel 0
pushed 0
back 0
on 0
the 0
officials’ 0
remarks, 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
while 0
he 0
stood 0
in 0
solidarity 0
with 0
Asian 0
American 0
identities, 0
none 0
of 0
his 0
remarks 0
were 0
offensive, 0
and 0
he 0
was 0
exposing 0
the 0
audience 0
to 0
ideas 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
found 0
“in 0
the 0
real 0
world.” 0
Before 0
he 0
could 0
finish, 0
Patel’s 0
microphone 0
was 0
cut 0
from 0
off-stage, 0
and 0
he 0
proceeded 0
to 0
leave. 0

The 0
real 0
world? 0

This 0
is 0

For 0
Sofia 0

‘22, 0
problems 0
with 0
the 0
performance 0
resided 0
not 0
in 0
the 0
set, 0
but 0
with 0
Patel’s 0
closing 0
remarks. 0

“I 0
really 0
dislike 0
when 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
older 0
say 0
that 0
our 0
generation 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
exposed 0
to 0
the 0
real 0
world. 0

Obviously 0
the 0
world 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
safe 0
space 0
but 0
just 0
accepting 0
that 0
it’s 0
not 0
and 0
continuing 0
to 0
perpetuate 0
the 0
un-safeness 0
of 0
it… 0
is 0
saying 0
that 0
it 0
can’t 0
be 0
changed,” 0
said 0
Jao. 0

“When 0
older 0
generations 0
say 0
you 0
need 0
to 0
stop 0
being 0
so 0
sensitive, 0
it’s 0

in 0

with 0
her 0
infamous 1

meeting 0
with 0
Bill 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
focused 0
on 0
process 0
and 0
procedures. 0

The 0
inspector 0
general 0
made 0
clear 0
when 0
he 0
launched 0
his 0
investigation 0
in 0
January 0
2017 0
that 0
“his 0
review 0
will 0
not 0
substitute 0
the 0
OIG's 0
judgment 0
for 0
the 0
judgments 0
made 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
or 0
the 0
Department 0
regarding 0
the 0
substantive 0
merits 0
of 0
investigative 0
or 0
prosecutive 0
decisions." 0

Moreover, 0
this 0
report 0
did 0
not 0
address 0
whether 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
or 0
FBI 0
abused 0
the 0
Foreign 0
Intelligence 0

Act 0
to 0
obtain 0

Christopher 0
Steele’s 0
salacious 1

unverified 0
“dossier” 0
in 0
its 0
FISA 0
court 0
application, 0
which 0
the 0
OIG 0
is 0
investigating 0
separately. 0

In 0
analyzing 0
the 0
highly 0
anticipated 0
OIG 0
report’s 0
conclusions, 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
either 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
himself 0
decided 0
to 0
pull 0
his 0
punches 0
or 0
that 0
the 0
final 0
version, 0
which 0
had 0
been 0
reviewed 0
by 0
upper 0
echelons 0
in 0
both 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department 0
before 0
its 0
public 0
release, 0
emerged 1
in 1
a 1
disappointingly 1
watered-down 1
form. 1

To 0
be 0
sure, 0
the 0
report 0
faulted 0
Comey 0
for 0
deviating 0
from 0
FBI 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department 0
procedures 0
in 0
handling 0
the 0
probe 0
into 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
use 0
of 0
a 0
private 0
e-mail 0
server 0
while 0
she 0
served 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
thereby 0
negatively 0
impacting 0
“the 0
perception 0
of 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
department 0
as 0
fair 0
administrators 0
of 0
justice.” 0
Comey, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
OIG 0
report, 0
“engaged 0
in 0
ad 0
hoc 0
decision 0
making 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
personal 0
views 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
meant 0
rejecting 0
longstanding 0
Department 0
policy 0
or 0
practice.” 0

Starting 0
with 0
Comey’s 0
public 0
announcement 0
on 0
July 0
5, 0
2016 0
criticizing 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
her 0
staff 0
for 0
being 0
“extremely 1
careless 1
in 0
their 0
handling 0
of 0
very 0
sensitive, 0
highly 0
classified 0
information,” 0
but 0
also 0
announcing 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
“expressing 0
to 0
Justice 0
our 0
view 0
that 0
no 0
charges 0
are 0
appropriate 0
in 0
this 0
case,” 0
Comey 0
was 0
taken 0
to 0
task 0
for 0
insubordination 0
and 0
usurping 0
the 0
authority 0
of 0
the 0
attorney 0
general. 0

He 0
“upset 0
the 0
well-established 0
separation 0
between 0
investigative 0
and 0
prosecutorial 0
functions,” 0
the 0
report 0
said. 0

Comey’s 0
follow-up 0
letters 0
to 0
Congress 0
on 0
October 0
28 0
and 0
November 0
6, 0
2016 0
were 0
similarly 0
criticized. 0

The 0
first 0
letter 0
informed 0
Congress 0
that 0
agents 0
were 0
reopening 0
their 0
probe 0
into 0
Clinton’s 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
material 0
after 0
discovering 0
her 0
e-mails 0
on 0
the 0
laptop 0
of 0
Andrew 0
Weiner, 0
the 0
husband 0
of 0
Clinton’s 0
top 0
aide 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

This 0
letter 0
was 0
followed 0
on 0
November 0
6, 0
2016 0
by 0
Comey’s 0
statement 0
that 0
the 0
review 0
of 0
the 0
additional 0
information 0
had 0
been 0
completed 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
remained 0
convinced 0
that 0
charges 0
were 0
not 0
appropriate. 0

Comey 0
acted 0
against 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
senior 0
Justice 0
Department 0
officials 0
in 0
making 0
these 0
disclosures 0
the 0
way 0
he 0
did. 0

The 0
OIG 0
report 0
was 0
highly 0
critical 0
of 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
failure 0
to 0
take 0
immediate 0
action 0
on 0
the 0
Weiner 0
laptop 0
when 0
they 0
first 0
learned 0
about 0
it 0
in 0
late 0
September 0
2016, 0
rather 0
than 0
waiting 0
another 0
month 0
so 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
election. 0

The 0
criticisms 0
of 0
Comey's 0
undisciplined 0
behavior 0
was 0
all 0
well 0
and 0
good, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
reasonable 0
to 0
expect 0
something 0
more 0
than 0
the 0
equivalent 0
of 0
a 0
departmental 0
employee 0
review 0
after 0
nearly 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
of 0
investigation. 0

Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
supporters 0
will 0
no 0
doubt 0
jump 0
on 0
the 0
inspector 0
general’s 0
criticisms 0
of 0
Comey’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
July 0
5th 0
announcement 0
and 0
subsequent 0
letters 0
as 0
proof 0
that 0
he 0
improperly 0
influenced 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
election 0
in 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
favor, 0
even 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
so 0
deliberately 0
for 0
political 0
reasons. 0

However, 0
what 0
Comey 0
really 0
did 0
was 0
to 0
give 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
a 1
Get 1
Out 1
of 1
Jail 1
Free 1
card. 1

The 0
fix 0
was 0
in 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
May 0
2016, 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
FBI 0
interviews 0
of 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
of 0
as 0
many 0
as 0
17 0
other 0
key 0
witnesses, 0
when 0
Comey 0
began 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
drafting 0
an 0
exoneration 0
memo. 0

Comey’s 0
initial 0
draft 0
statement, 0
which 0
he 0
shared 0
with 0
FBI 0
senior 0
leadership 0
on 0
May 0
2, 0
criticized 0
Clinton’s 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
information 0
as 0
“grossly 1
negligent,” 1
but 0
concluded 0
that 0
“no 0
reasonable 0
prosecutor” 0
would 0
bring 0
a 0
case 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
facts 0
developed 0
in 0
the 0
investigation. 0

Indeed, 0
Comey 0
admitted 0
in 0
his 0
book 0
that 0
“we 0
started 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation 0
aware 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
unlikely 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
case 0
that 0
career 0
prosecutors 0
at 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
would 0
prosecute.” 0

If 0
putting 0
the 0
cart 0
of 0
exoneration 0
before 0
the 0
horse 0
of 0
investigation 0
were 0
not 0
enough, 0
Comey’s 0
draft 0
statement 0
underwent 0
various 0
language 0
changes 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
next 0
two 0
months, 0
including, 0
most 0
importantly, 0
changing 0
the 0
description 0
of 0
Clinton’s 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
information 0
from 0
“grossly 1
negligent” 1
to 0
“extremely 1
careless.” 1
This 0
change 0
was 0
critical 0
because 0
“gross 1
negligence” 1
is 0
specifically 0
the 0
legal 0
term 0
used 0
in 0
stating 0
the 0
statutory 0
requirement 0
in 0
18 0
U.S. 0
Code 0
§ 0
793(f) 0
for 0
a 0
finding 0
of 0
criminal 0
conduct. 0

Comey’s 0
substitution 0
of 0
a 0
legally 0
meaningless 0
phrase, 0
“extremely 1
careless,” 1
for 0
the 0
“gross 1
negligence” 1
statutory 0
legal 0
standard 0
he 0
had 0
originally 0
used, 0
had 0
the 0
effect 0
of 0
prejudging 0
the 0
facts 0
in 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
favor. 0

Andrew 0
McCabe, 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
edits. 0

Inspector 0
General 0
Horowitz 0
saw 0
no 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
pattern 0
of 0
obfuscation 0
regarding 0
the 0
deletion 0
of 0
the 0
legally 0
significant 0
phrase 0
“gross 1
negligence” 1
from 0
Comey’s 0
statement. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
relied 0
in 0
part 0
on 0
opinions 0
from 0
prosecutors 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
enough 0
evidence 0
to 0
charge 0
Clinton 0
with 0
acting 0
in 0
a 0
manner 0
that 0
rose 0
to 0
a 0
level 0
of 0
criminal 0
gross 1
negligence 1
with 0
respect 0
to 0
sending 0
or 0
receiving 0
e-mails 0
determined 0
to 0
contain 0
classified 0
information. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
thus 0
concluded, 0
“We 0
did 0
not 0
identify 0
evidence 0
of 0
bias 0
or 0
improper 0
considerations.” 0
This 0
conclusion 0
defies 0
common 0
sense. 0

Gross 1
negligence 1
is 0
not 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
willful 0
intent, 0
which 0
Comey 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
sought 0
to 0
conflate 0
in 0
exonerating 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
before 0
the 0
investigation 0
was 0
concluded. 0

Clinton 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
she 0
was 0
doing 0
when 0
she 0
set 0
up 0
the 0

server 0
arrangement 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
and 0
knowingly 0
used 0
it 0
to 0
send 0
and 0
receive 0
e-mails 0
involving 0
official 0
government 0
business, 0
which 0
by 0
their 0
very 0
nature 0
would 0
be 0
expected 0
to 0
include 0
classified 0
information. 0

It 0
turns 0
out 0
that 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
e-mails 0
were 0
accessed 0
by 0
foreign 0
parties. 0

Hillary 0
lied 0
repeatedly 0
when 0
she 0
first 0
denied 0
there 0
were 0
any 0
classified 0
e-mails 0
on 0
her 0
system 0
and 0
then 0
described 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
e-mails 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
as 0
having 0
been 0
classified 0
after 0
the 0
fact. 0

As 0
Comey 0
has 0
admitted, 0
several 0
e-mail 0
chains 0
concerned 0
matters 0
that 0
were 0
classified 0
at 0
the 0
Top 0
Secret/Special 0
Access 0
Program 0
level 0
when 0
they 0
were 0
sent 0
and 0
received 0
by 0
Clinton. 0

Coupled 0
with 0
her 0
agents’ 0
destruction 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
e-mails 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
subpoenaed 0
by 0
Congress, 0
Hillary’s 0
conduct 0
was 0
criminally 1
reckless 1
at 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
if 0
not 0
constituting 0
willful 1
intent 1
to 1
commit 1
an 1
act 1
she 1
knew 1
was 1
wrongful. 1

Yet 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
saw 0
no 0
reason 0
to 0
doubt 0
the 0
sincerity 0
of 0
Comey's 0
explanations 0
for 0
giving 0
Hillary 0
a 0
free 0
pass. 0

The 0
failure 0
to 0
at 0
least 0
empanel 0
a 0
grand 0
jury 0
to 0
compel 0
testimony 0
from 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
key 0
witnesses 0
was 0
itself 0
a 0
complete 0
dereliction 0
of 0
duty, 0
which 0
could 0
have 0
only 0
been 0
motivated 0
by 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
treat 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
with 1
kid 1
gloves 1
for 0
improper 0
reasons. 0

Incredibly, 0
however, 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
“found 0
no 0
persuasive 0
evidence… 0
that 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
different 0
had 0
Clinton 0
been 0
subpoenaed 0
before 0
the 0
grand 0
jury.” 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
also 0
did 0
not 0
deem 0
Comey’s 0
possible 0
perjury 0
in 0
his 0
testimony 0
before 0
Congress 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
appropriate 0
subject 0
for 0
criminal 0
referral. 0

Comey 0
testified 0
that 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
exonerate 0
Hillary 0
was 0
not 0
made 0
before 0
her 0
interview 0
took 0
place, 0
when 0
for 0
all 0
intents 0
and 0
purposes 0
it 0
was. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
simply 0
took 0
Comey’s 0
word 0
for 0
what 0
he 0
had 0
meant. 0

Inspector 0
General 0
Horowitz 0
again 0
emphasized 0
form 0
and 0
process 0
over 0
substance 0
in 0
finding 0
a 0
“troubling 0
lack 0
of 0
any 0
direct, 0
substantive 0
communication” 0
between 0
Comey 0
and 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Lynch 0
ahead 0
of 0
Comey’s 0
July 0
5 0
press 0
conference 0
on 0
Clinton 0
and 0
his 0
October 0
28 0
letter 0
to 0
Congress. 0

Attorney 0
General 0
Lynch’s 0
infamous 1
tarmac 0
meeting 0
with 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
was 0
discussed 0
in 0
the 0
report, 0
but 0
mostly 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
how 0
it 0
affected 0
Comey’s 0
decision 0
to 0
go 0
rogue, 0
so 0
to 0
speak, 0
in 0
making 0
his 0
July 0
5th 0
announcement 0
without 0
prior 0
approval 0
from 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

As 0
to 0
the 0
substance 0
of 0
Ms. 0
Lynch’s 0
decision 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
at 0
all 0
before 0
his 0
wife’s 0
FBI 0
interview, 0
all 0
Mr. 0
Horowitz’s 0
report 0
had 0
to 0
say 0
was 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
“an 0
error 0
in 0
judgment.” 0

The 0
OIG 0
report 0
also 0
criticized 0
the 0
conduct 0
of 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page, 0
who 0
had 0
exchanged 0
text 0
messages 0
sharply 1
critical 1
of 1
Mr. 1
Trump 1
before 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
election, 0
for 0
casting 0
“a 0
cloud 0
over 0
the 0
entire 0
FBI 0
investigation.” 0
The 0
report 0
referenced 0
a 0
text 0
message 0
on 0
August 0
8, 0
2016, 0
in 0
which 0
Strzok 0
reassured 0
Page 0
that 0
she 0
need 0
not 0
worry 0
about 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
becoming 0
president. 0

Trump 0
is 0
“not 0
ever 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
president, 0
right? 0

Right? 0

!” 0
Page 0
texted 0
Strzok. 0

“No. 0

No 0
he’s 0
not. 0

We’ll 0
stop 0
it,” 0
Strzok 0
responded. 0

Mr. 0
Horowitz 0
wrote 0
that 0
this 0
exchange 0
was 0
“not 0
only 0
indicative 0
of 0
a 0
biased 0
state 0
of 0
mind 0
but, 0
even 0
more 0
seriously, 0
implies 0
a 0
willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action 0
to 0
impact 0
the 0
presidential 0
candidate’s 0
electoral 0
prospects.” 0
The 0
inspector 0
general 0
questioned 0
whether 0
Strzok’s 0
decision 0
to 0
prioritize 0
the 0
Russia 0
collusion 0
investigation 0
over 0
following 0
up 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
e-mail-related 0
investigative 0
lead 0
discovered 0
on 0
the 0
Weiner 0
laptop 0
was 0
free 0
from 0
bias. 0

Ultimately, 0
however, 0
he 0
inexplicably 1
concluded 1
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
finding 0
of 0
“documentary 0
or 0
testimonial 0
evidence 0
that 0
improper 0
considerations, 0
including 0
political 0
bias, 0
directly 0
affected 0
the 0
specific 0
investigative 0
decisions” 0
discussed 0
in 0
the 0
OIG 0
report. 0

Strzok 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
subject 0
to 0
a 0
criminal 0
referral 0
for 0
arguably 0
violating 0
18 0
U.S.C. 0

§ 0
595, 0
enacted 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
original 0
1939 0
Hatch 0
Act, 0
prohibiting 0
any 0
public 0
officer 0
or 0
employee, 0
in 0
connection 0
with 0
an 0
activity 0
financed 0
wholly 0
or 0
in 0
part 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
from 0
using 0
his 0
or 0
her 0
official 0
authority 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
or 0
affect 0
the 0
nomination 0
or 0
election 0
of 0
a 0
candidate 0
for 0
federal 0
office 0
including 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

The 0
punishment 0
for 0
violation 0
is 0
a 0
fine, 0
imprisonment 0
for 0
not 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
year 0
or 0
both. 0

Instead, 0
Strzok's 0
punishment 0
will 0
most 0
likely 0
be 0
limited 0
to 0
disciplinary 0
action 0
and 0
possibly 0
dismissal. 0

In 0
sum, 0
the 0
long-awaited 0
inspector 0
general 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
and 0
Justice 0
Department’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
e-mail 0
investigation 0
is 0
as 1
disappointing 1
as 1
the 1
rigged 1
outcome 1
of 1
the 1
e-mail 1
investigation 1
itself. 0

Trump 0
formally 0
nominates 0

WASHINGTON 0
— 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
formally 0
notified 0
Congress 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
deputy 0
CIA 0
director 0
Gina 0
Haspel 0
is 0
his 0
pick 0
to 0
lead 0
the 0
agency. 0

Trump 0

tweeted 0
last 0

that 0
he 0
had 0
selected 0
Haspel 0
to 0
replace 0
Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
who 0
is 0
being 0
considered 0
to 0
be 0
secretary 0
of 0
state. 0

But 0
the 0
president 0
had 0
not 0
sent 0
the 0
formal 0
paperwork 0
to 0
Capitol 0
Hill. 0

Logistical 0

issues, 0
including 0
an 0
FBI 0
background 0
check 0
that 0
took 0
longer 0
than 0
expected, 0
was 0
to 0
blame, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
U.S. 0
official, 0
who 0
was 0
not 0
authorized 0
to 0
discuss 0
the 0
issue 0
and 0
spoke 0
only 0
on 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity. 0

Still, 0

the 0
delay 0
prompted 0
critics 0
to 0
speculate 0
that 0
the 1
delay 1
signaled 1
the 1
White 1
House 1
was 1
having 1
second 1
thoughts 1
about 1
the 1
nomination. 1

Some 0
lawmakers 0
and 0
human 0
rights 0
groups 0
oppose 0
Haspel’s 0
nomination 0
because 0
of 0
her 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
detention 0
and 0
harsh 0
interrogation 0
of 0
terror 0
suspects 0
after 0
9/11. 0

The 0

Senate 0
intelligence 0
committee 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
confirmation 0
hearing 0
for 0
Haspel 0
in 0
coming 0
weeks, 0
followed 0
by 0
a 0
vote 0
in 0
the 0
full 0
Senate. 0

Not 0
So 0
Fast 0

It’s 0
got 0
to 0
be 0
either 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
stupidest 1
acts 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
recall 0
or 0
a 0
very 1
wicked 1
plan 0
by 0
Washington 0

the 0
decision 0
by 0

South 0
Korea 0
to 0
stage 0

The 0
prickly 1
North 0
Koreans 0
had 0
a 0
fit, 0
of 0
course, 0
as 0
always 0
when 0
the 0
US 0
flexes 0
its 0

Who 0

the 0

for 0
blowing 0
their 0

As 0

were 0
gabbing 1
about 0

and 0

the 0
US 0
Air 0

reneged 0
on 0

In 0
a 0

Trump 0
demanded 0
that 0

In 0
short, 0
a 0
total 1
surrender 1
policy 0
leading 0
to 0
future 0
regime 0
change. 0

Hardly 0
an 0
encouragement 0
for 0
North 0
Korea. 0

North 0
Korea 0
was 0
right 0
on 0
target 0
when 0
it 0
accused 0
arch-neocon 0
John 0
Bolton 0
of 0
trying 0
to 0
sabotage 0
the 0
peace 0
deal. 0

In 0
2005-2006, 0
Bolton 0
served 0
as 0
the 0
Bush 0
administration’s 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN. 0

He 0
established 0
a 0
tradition 0
for 0
the 0
post 0
of 0
being 0
anti-Muslim, 0
pro-Israel 0
and 0
anti-Russian, 0
a 0
policy 0
continued 0
to 0
this 0
day 0
by 0
the 0
current 0
US 0
UN 0
rep, 0
loud-mouthed 0
neocon 0
Nikki 0
Haley. 0

In 0
the 0
2005-2006 0
period, 0
after 0
years 0
of 0
negotiations, 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
North 0
Korea 0
were 0
close 0
to 0
a 0
nuclear/peace 0
deal. 0

Enter 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

He 0
succeeded 0
in 0
sabotaging 0
the 0
US-North 0
Korea 0
deal. 0

Why? 0

Because 0
Bolton, 0
as 0
an 0
arch 0
neocon, 0
was 0
fanatically 1
pro-Israel 0
and 0
feared 0
that 0
North 0
Korea 0
might 0
provide 0
nuclear 0
technology 0
to 0
Israel’s 0
foes. 0

As 0
usual 0
with 0
the 0
neocons, 0
Israel’s 0
interests 0
came 0
before 0
those 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Trump’s 0
newly 0
named 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
Michael 0
Pompeo, 0
is 0
also 0
an 0
ardent 0
neocon. 0

Last 0
week, 0
Bolton 0
went 0
onto 0
US 0
TV 0
and 0
actually 0
suggested 0
North 0
Korea 0
might 0
follow 0
the 0
course 0
set 0
by 0
Libya, 0
of 0
all 0
places. 0

Libya’s 0
then 0
ruler, 0
Muammar 0
Kadaffi, 0
bought 0
some 0
nuclear 0
equipment 0
from 0
Pakistan 0
so 0
he 0
could 0
hand 0
it 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
as 0
a 0
gesture 0
of 0
cooperation 0
after 0
the 0
Bush 0
administration 0
invaded 0
Iraq. 0

The 0
handover 0
was 0
done 0
with 0
much 1
fanfare, 1
then 0
the 0
US, 0
France 0
and 0
Britain 0

in 1

The 0
Northerners 0

it, 0
here's 1
a 1
still 1
frame 1
of 1
Ellison 1
just 1
a 1
few 1
feet 1
away 1
from 1
a 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
called 1
on 1
10,000 1
blacks 1
to 1
stalk 1
and 1
murder 1
white 1
people. 1

Both 0
of 0
these 0
men 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
devil 0
as 0
their 0
father 0
because 0
both 0
men 0
are 0
following 0
after 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Koran 0
. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
just 0
actually 0
has 0
the 0
nerve 0
to 0
say 0
it. 0

The 0
other 0
doesn't. 0

Maybe 0
Ellison 0
is 0
attempting 0
to 1
pull 1
an 1
Obama. 1

Remember 0
when 0
Obama's 0
"pastor," 0
Jeremiah 0
Wright 0
uttered 0
"God 0
damn, 0
America!"? 0

Obama 0
tried 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
that 0
church 0
for 0
years 0
and 0
never 0
heard 0
such 0
things, 0
which 0
isn't 0
true. 0

Ellison 1
is 1
attempting 1
to 1
do 1
that 1
same. 1

However, 0
as 0
Michael 0
Ahrens 0

Ellison 0
knew 0
what 0
kind 0
of 0

and 0
what 0

he 0
still 0
is 0
today. 0

who 0

supported 0
by 0

Airborne: 1
Officials 0
Warn 0
That 0
The 0
“Black 1

Rapidly 1

The 0
fears 0
that 0
the 0
“black 1
death” 1
would 0
spread 0
from 0
Madagascar 0
have 0
now 0
taken 0
hold. 0

As 0
nations 0
grapple 0
with 0
the 0
outbreak 0
of 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague, 0
nine 0
countries 0
are 0
sounding 1
warnings 1
that 1
the 1
disease 1
is 1
spreading 1
rapidly. 1

The 0
deadly 0
plague 0
outbreak 0
that 0
has 0
struck 0
Madagascar’s 0
major 0
cities 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
“peak” 0
and 0
that 0
could 0
make 0
the 0
spread 0
of 0
this 0
infection 0
into 0
the 0
surrounding 0
regions 0
more 0
likely. 0

Dr. 0
Ashok 0
Chopra, 0
a 0
professor 0
of 0
microbiology 0
and 0
immunology 0
at 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
Texas, 0
told 0
The 0
Sun 0
Online 0
the 1
crisis 1
in 1
Madagascar 1
had 1
yet 1
to 1
peak. 1

He 0
also 0
sounded 1
the 1
alarm 1
to 0
neighboring 0
countries. 0

Since 0
there 0
are 0
regular 0
flights 0
in 0
and 0
out 0
of 0
Madagascar 0
and 0
this 0
outbreak 0
has 0
so 0
far, 0
been 0
impossible 0
to 0
contain, 0
other 0
nations 0
are 0
now 0
at 0
risk. 0

Speaking 0
from 0
Madagascar, 0
Christine 0
South, 0
head 0
of 0
IFRC’s 0
(International 0
Federation 0
of 0
Red 0
Cross) 0
emergency 0
operations, 0
said: 0
“With 0
anything 0
like 0
this 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
that 0
somebody 0
could 0
be 0
infected 0
and 0
get 0
on 0
a 0
plane. 0

We 0
have 0
done 0
preparedness 0
support 0
to 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
neighboring 0
countries.” 0
Tourists 0
have 0
been 0
warned 0
to 0
stay 0
out 0
of 0
Madagascar 0
until 0
doctors 0
can 0
get 0
the 0
plague 0
under 0
control 0
to 0
prevent 0
its 0
spread. 0

The 0
outbreak 0
is 0
considered 0
a 0
much 0
bigger 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
region 0
than 0
in 0
previous 0
years 0
because 0
it 0
has 0
taken 0
on 0
its 0
pneumonic 0
form. 0

That 0
means 0
it 0
is 0
airborne 0
and 0
spread 0
by 0
sneezing 0
and 0
coughing. 0

Not 0
only 0
that, 0
but 0
the 0
plague 0
has 0
a 0
very 0
short 0
incubation 0
time. 0

Once 0
exposed, 0
some 0
people 0
will 0
die 0
within 0
24 0
hours. 0

Experts 0
say 0
the 1
epidemic 1
could 1
still 1
worsen 1
as 0
the 0
death 0
tolls 0
hit 0
124 0
and 0
more 0
than 0
1,300 0
are 0
left 0
infected. 0

The 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
(WHO) 0
has 0
now 0
issued 0
alarming 1
warnings 1
in 0
nine 0
countries 0
too. 0

“If 0
they 0
are 0
traveling 0
shorter 0
distances 0
and 0
they’re 0
still 0
in 0
the 0
incubation 0
period, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
the 0
pneumonic 0
(form) 0
then 0
they 0
could 0
spread 0
it 0
to 0
other 0
places,” 0
said 0
Chopra. 0

“We 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
situation 0
where 0
the 0
disease 0
spreads 0
so 0
fast 0
it 0
sort 0
of 0
gets 0
out 0
of 0
control. 0

Most 0
of 0
the 0
cases 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
have 0
been 0
of 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
this 0
particular 0
outbreak, 0
70 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
cases 0
are 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
deadly 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
disease. 0

If 1
the 1
treatment 1
is 1
not 1
given 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
short 1
period 1
of 1
time 1
these 1
people 1
will 1
end 1
up 1
dying.” 1

Both 0
forms 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
can 0
be 0
cured 0
with 0
antibiotics, 0
but 0
getting 0

more 0
than 0
1,100 0

But 0
while 0
this 0

grumbling 0
took 0
place, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
dutifully 0
reported 0
official 0
statements 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
veracity 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
disputed. 0

Tom 0
Wells, 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
exhaustive 0
exposé 0
“The 0
War 0
Within: 0
America’s 0
Battle 0
Over 0
Vietnam,” 0
explained 0
the 0
media 0
egregiously 0
erred 0
in 0
“almost 0
exclusive 0
reliance 0
on 0
U.S. 0
government 0
officials 0
as 0
sources 0
of 0
information” 0
and 0
“reluctance 0
to 0
question 0

pronouncements 0
on 0
‘national 0
security 0
issues.’” 0

If 0
due 0
diligence 0
had 0
been 0
performed, 0
and 0
reporters 0
had 0
raised 0
appropriate 0
doubts 0
about 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
false 0
flag, 0
it’s 0
arguable 0
whether 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
contentious 0
war 0
would 0
have 0
lasted 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
it 0
did. 0

Sadly, 0
the 0
United 0

has 0
a 0
tendency 0
to 0
repeat 0
the 0
same 0
mistakes 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again. 0

And 0
now, 0
a 0

that 0
another 0

Tonkin 0
incident 0
could 0
bring 0
us 0
into 0
war 0
with 0
Iran. 0

As 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
continues 0
to 0
surround 0
himself 0
with 0
neocon 1
warhawks, 1
the 0
drums 0
are 0
beating 0
for 0
war 0
with 0
Iran. 0

The 0
rhetoric 0
is 0
becoming 0
so 0
strong, 0
that 0
Trump 0
himself 0
— 0
without 0
provocation 0
— 0
began 0
tweeting 0
threats 0
to 0
the 0
sovereign 0
nation. 0

On 0
Tuesday, 0
Fox 0
News 0
host 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
and 0
Colonel 0
Douglas 0
Macgregor 0
addressed 0
the 0
growing 0
prospect 0
of 0
US 0
war 0
with 0
Iran 0
and 0
warned 0
that 0
a 0
new 0
“Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident” 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drag 0
us 0
into 0
it. 0

Carlson 0
mocked 0
the 0
neocons’ 0
claims 0
that 0
Iran 0
is 0
the 0
“greatest 1
threat” 1
to 0
America, 1
explicitly 0
noting 0
that 0
“virtually 0
every 0
attack 0
in 0
America 0
has 0
been 0
inspired 0
not 0
by 0
Iran, 0
but 0
by 0
Iran’s 0
Sunni 0
enemies.” 0

Carlson 0
pointed 0
out 0
how 0
the 0
neocons 0
are 0
hellbent 1
on 0
pushing 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
into 0
a 0
new 0
war. 0

“If 0
there 0
was 0
ever 0
a 0
swamp 0
in 0
Washington 0
you 0
are 0
looking 0
at 0
it 0
— 0
the 0
foreign 0
policy 0
establishment 0
— 0
they 0
are 0
working 0
overtime 0
to 0
ensnare 1
the 0
president 0
in 0
a 0
mess 0
in 0
Iran,” 0
Carlson 0
said. 0

“Let’s 0
hope 0
that 0
he 0
understands 0
exactly 0
what’s 0
going 0
on.” 0

Pointing 0
out 0
Trump’s 0
recent 0
attempts 0
at 0
diplomacy 0
with 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
Russia, 0
Col. 0
Macgregor 0
weighed 0
in, 0
noting 0
that 0
he 0
thinks 0
Trump 0
will 0
attempt 0
to 0
avoid 0
war 0
with 0
Iran. 0

However, 0
he 0
noted 0
that 0
a 0
false 0
flag 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drag 0
us 0
into 0
it. 0

“I 0
think 0
the 0
president 0
needs 0
to 0
watch 0
carefully 0
for 0
the 0
potential 0
for 0
something 0
like 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident,” 0
Col. 0
Macgregor 0
said. 0

“Many 0
of 0
your 0
viewers 0
may 0
not 0
remember 0
that 0
it 0
never 0
happened 0
and 0
we 0
could 0
very 0
well 0
be 0
treated 0
to 0
something 0
like 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
Gulf. 0

We 0
should 0
watch 0
for 0
that, 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
comments 0
on 0
fake 0
news, 0
he 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
sabotage 0
by 0
fake 0
news.” 0

Carlson 0
then 0
pointed 0
out 0
how 0
the 0
Trump 0
admin 0
has 0
reacted 0
to 0
fake 0
news 0
by 0
attacking 0
Syria—twice. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
may 0
be 0
unaware, 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
overthrow 0
Iran 0
has 0
long 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
works. 0

In 0
fact, 0
in 0
April 0
2012, 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize-winning 0
journalist, 0
Seymour 0
Hersh 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Joint 0
Special 0
Operations 0
Command 0
had 0
trained 0
(Mojahedin-e 0
Khalq) 0
MEK 0
operatives 0
at 0
a 0
secret 0
site 0
in 0
Nevada 0
from 0
2005 0
to 0
2009. 0

MEK 0
is 0
the 0
Iranian 0
political-militant 0
organization 0
that 0
advocates 0
for 0
the 0
violent 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime. 0

They 0
are 0
hardly 0
quiet 0
about 0
it. 0

According 0
to 0
Hersh, 0
MEK 0
members 0
were 0
trained 0
in 0
intercepting 0
communications, 0
cryptography, 0
weaponry 0
and 0
small 0
unit 0
tactics 0
at 0
the 0
Nevada 0
site 0
until 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
took 0
office 0
in 0
2009. 0

Hersh 0
also 0
reported 0
additional 0
names 0
of 0
former 0
U.S. 0
officials 0
paid 0
to 0
speak 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
MEK, 0
including 0
former 0
CIA 0
directors 0
James 0
Woolsey 0
and 0
Porter 0
Goss; 0
New 0
York 0
City 0
Mayor 0
Rudolph 0
Giuliani; 0
former 0
Vermont 0
Governor 0
Howard 0
Dean; 0
former 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Investigation 0
Louis 0
Freeh 0
and 0
former 0
U.N. 0

Ambassador 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

Coincidentally, 0
MEK 0
was 0
classified 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
its 0
allies—during 0
this 0
training 0
period—until 0
they 0
suddenly 0
removed 0
them 0
from 0
the 0
list 0
in 0
2012. 0

While 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
is 0
certainly 0
no 0
bastion 0
of 0
freedom, 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
US 0
intervention 0
or 0
a 0
violent 0
revolution 0
would 0
be 0
beneficial 0
for 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
is 0
outright 1
insane. 1

To 0
see 0
what 0
US 0
intervention—through 0
military 0
support 0
and 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
‘protesters’—does 0
to 0
countries, 0
one 0
need 0
only 0
look 0
at 0
Syria, 0
Iraq, 0
Afghanistan, 0
and 0
Libya 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
horrific 1
death 0
tolls 0
and 0
war-ravaged 1
dystopias 1
left 0
in 0
America’s 0
wake. 0

To 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
over 0
the 0
years, 0
Trump’s 0
desire 0
to 0
intervene 0
in 0
Iran, 0
and 0
his 0
subsequent 0
support 0
in 0
the 0
media 0
should 0
come 0
as 0
no 0
surprise 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
plan 0
since 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
was 0
in 0
office 0
and 0
was 0
documented 0
in 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
PNAC 0
report. 0

This 0
was 0
even 0
admitted 0
by 0
General 0
Wesley 0
Clark, 0
former 0
Supreme 0
Allied 0
Commander 0
of 0
NATO, 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
planned 0
on 0
going 0
to 0
war 0
with 0
Iran, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
2001 0
memo 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
memo 0
that 0
describes 0
how 0
we’re 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
out 0
seven 0
countries 0
in 0
five 0
years,” 0
Clark 0
said. 0

“Starting 0
with 0
Iraq, 0
and 0
then 0
Syria, 0
Lebanon, 0
Libya, 0
Somalia, 0
Sudan, 0
and 0
finishing 0
off 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

All 0
presidents 0
since 0
Clinton 0
have 0
crossed 0
countries 0
off 0
this 0
list. 0

Now 0
it’s 0
Trump’s 0
turn. 0

when 0

To 0

Jews 0

No 0
one 0
forced 0
J 0
Street 0
to 0
collaborate 0
with 0
anti-Semites. 0

And 0
here's 0
J 0
Street 0
trying 0
to 0
decide 0
whether 0
to 0
stop 0
endorsing 0
a 1
Democrat 1
who 1
pals 1
around 1
with 1
Farrakhan 1
and 0
defended 0
him 0
by 0
mentioning 0
the 0
"Jewish 1
question." 1

Democratic 0
Illinois 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
defended 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan 0
as 0
an 0
“outstanding 0
human 0
being” 0
on 0
Monday. 0

Farrakhan’s 0
history 0
of 0
racially 1
extreme 1
comments 1
includes 0
blaming 0
Jews 0
for 0
the 0
September 0
11 0
attacks, 0
saying 0
white 1
people 1
“deserve 1
to 1
die” 1
and 0
praising 1
Adolf 1
Hitler 1
as 1
a 1
“very 1
great 1
man.” 1
“I 0
personally 0
know 0
[Farrakhan], 0
I’ve 0
been 0
to 0
his 0
home, 0
done 0
meetings, 0
participated 0
in 0
events 0
with 0
him,” 0
Davis 0
told 0
TheDC. 0

The 0
congressman 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
why 0
the 0
ADL 0
wrote 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misquoted 0
in 0
his 0
praise 0
for 0
the 0
anti-Semite, 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
if 0
someone 0
from 0
his 0
office 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
ADL 0
he 0
was 0
misquoted, 0
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
News 0
Foundation 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

“I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
to 0
write. 0

Nah, 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
Farrakhan, 0
I 0
don’t 0
spend 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
my 0
time 0
dealing 0
with 0
those 0
kind 0
of 0
things,” 0
Davis 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
just 0
one 0
segment 0
of 0
what 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
our 0
world. 0

The 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
Farrakhan 1
and 1
the 1
Jewish 1
question 1
and 1
his 1
position 1
on 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
forth. 1

For 0
those 0
heavy 0
into 0
it, 0
that’s 0
their 0
thing, 0
but 0
it 0
ain’t 0
my 0
thing,” 0
he 0
said 0

The 0
"Jewish 0
Question" 0
is 0
a 0
term 0
generally 0
used 0
by 0
anti-Semites 0
today. 0

But 0
J 0
Street 0
is 0
stuck 0
with 0
its 0
own 0
Jewish 0
Question. 0

How 0
much 0
anti-Semitism 0
is 0
too 0
much 0
even 0
for 0
it. 0

Left-wing 0
advocacy 0
group 0
J 0
Street 0
said 0
it 0
is 0
re-evaluating 0
its 0
endorsement 0
of 0
a 0
congressman 0
who 0
praised 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan. 0

JStreetPAC, 0
the 0
arm 0
of 0
the 0
NGO 0
that 0
funds 0
and 0
endorses 0
candidates, 0
currently 0
lists 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis, 0
an 0
Illinois 0
Democrat 0
from 0
the 0
virulently 1
anti-Semitic 1
Farrakhan’s 0
home 0
base 0
of 0
Chicago, 0
as 0
a 0
candidate 0
it 0
supports. 0

The 0
endorsement, 0
first 0
reported 0
in 0
the 0
Forward, 0
calls 0
Davis 0
“a 0
longtime 0
supporter 0
of 0
Israel 0
and 0
a 0
two-state 0
solution.” 0

In 0
J 0
Street's 0
home 0
dimension 0
of 0
Oceania, 0
supporter 1
of 1
Israel 1
means 1
Farrakhan 1
supporter. 1

“We 0
take 0
anti-Semitism 0
quite 0
seriously,” 0
J 0
Street’s 0
statement 0
read. 0

“We 0
are 0
currently 0
in 0
conversation 0
with 0
Representative 0
Davis’ 0
office 0
about 0
this 0
issue. 0

We 0
will 0
get 0
back 0
to 0
you 0
shortly 0
with 0
a 0
more 0
extensive 0
response.” 0

So 1
seriously 1
that 1
J 1
Street 1
can't 1
decide 1
what 0
to 0
do 0
about 0
a 0
politician 0
who 0
defends 0
a 1
Hitler-lover 1
and 0
raises 0

That's 0

its 0

that 0

been 0

from 0

Reporter 1
Luke 1
Harding’s 1
latest 1
article, 1
claiming 1
that 1
Donald 1
Trump’s 1
disgraced 1
former 1
campaign 1
manager 1
Paul 1
Manafort 1
secretly 1
visited 1
Assange 1
in 1
Ecuador’s 1
embassy 1
in 1
London 1
on 1
three 1
occasions, 1
is 1
so 1
full 1
of 1
holes 1
that 1
even 1
hardened 1
opponents 1
of 1
Assange 1
in 1
the 1
corporate 1
media 1
are 1
struggling 1
to 1
stand 1
by 1
it. 1

Faced 1
with 1
the 1
backlash, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
quickly 1
– 1
and 1
very 1
quietly 1
– 1
rowed 1
back 1
its 1
initial 1
certainty 1
that 1
its 1
story 1
was 1
based 1
on 1
verified 1
facts. 1

Instead, 1
it 1
amended 1
the 1
text, 1
without 1
acknowledging 1
it 1
had 1
done 1
so, 1
to 1
attribute 1
the 1
claims 1
to 1
unnamed, 1
and 1
uncheckable, 1
“sources”. 1

The 1
propaganda 1
function 1
of 1
the 1
piece 1
is 1
patent. 1

It 0
is 0
intended 0
to 0
provide 0
evidence 0
for 0
long-standing 0
allegations 0
that 0
Assange 0
conspired 0
with 0
Trump, 0
and 0
Trump’s 0
supposed 0
backers 0
in 0
the 0
Kremlin, 0
to 0
damage 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
race. 0

The 1
Guardian’s 1
latest 1
story 1
provides 1
a 1
supposedly 1
stronger 1
foundation 1
for 1
an 1
existing 1
narrative: 1
that 1
Assange 1
and 1
Wikileaks 1
knowingly 1
published 1
emails 1
hacked 1
by 1
Russia 1
from 1
the 1
Democratic 1
party’s 1
servers. 1

In 1
truth, 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
public 1
evidence 1
that 1
the 1
emails 1
were 1
hacked, 1
or 1
that 1
Russia 1
was 1
involved. 1

Central 1
actors 1
have 1
suggested 1
instead 1
that 1
the 1
emails 1
were 1
leaked 1
from 1
within 1
the 1
Democratic 1
party. 1

Nonetheless, 0
this 0
unverified 0
allegation 0
has 0
been 0
aggressively 1
exploited 1
by 0
the 0
Democratic 0
leadership 0
because 0
it 0
shifts 0
attention 0
away 0
both 0
from 0
its 0
failure 0
to 0
mount 0
an 0
effective 0
electoral 0
challenge 0
to 0
Trump 0
and 0
from 0
the 0
damaging 0
contents 0
of 0
the 0
emails. 0

These 0
show 0
that 0
party 0
bureaucrats 0
sought 0
to 0
rig 0
the 0
primaries 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
Clinton’s 0
challenger 0
for 0
the 0
Democratic 0
nomination, 0
Bernie 0
Sanders, 0
lost. 0

To 0
underscore 0
the 0
intended 0
effect 0
of 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
new 0
claims, 0
Harding 0
even 0
throws 0
in 0
a 0
casual 0
and 0
unsubstantiated 0
reference 0
to 0
“Russians” 1
joining 0
Manafort 0
in 0
supposedly 0
meeting 0
Assange. 0

Manafort 0
has 0
denied 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
claims, 0
while 0
Assange 0
has 0
threatened 0
to 0
sue 0
the 0
Guardian 0
for 0
libel. 0

‘Responsible 0
for 0
Trump’ 0

The 0
emotional 0
impact 0
of 0
the 0
Guardian 0
story 0
is 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
Assange 0
is 0
responsible 0
for 0
four 0
years 0
or 0
more 0
of 0
Trump 0
rule. 0

But 0
more 0
significantly, 0
it 0
bolsters 0
the 0
otherwise 0
risible 0
claim 0
that 0
Assange 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
publisher 0
– 0
and 0
thereby 0
entitled 0
to 0
the 0
protections 0
of 0
a 0
free 0
press, 0
as 0
enjoyed 0
by 0
the 0
Guardian 0
or 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
– 0
but 0
the 1
head 1
of 1
an 1
organisation 1
engaged 1
in 1
espionage 1
for 1
a 1
foreign 1
power. 1

The 0
intention 0
is 0
to 0
deeply 0
discredit 0
Assange, 0
and 0
by 0
extension 0
the 0
Wikileaks 0
organisation, 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
right-thinking 0
liberals. 0

That, 0
in 0
turn, 0
will 0
make 0
it 0
much 0
easier 0
to 0
silence 0
Assange 0
and 0
the 0
vital 0
cause 0
he 0
represents: 0
the 0
use 0
of 0
new 0
media 0
to 0
hold 0
to 0
account 0
the 0
old, 0
corporate 0
media 0
and 0
political 0
elites 0
through 0
the 0
imposition 0
of 0
far 0
greater 0
transparency. 0

The 0
Guardian 0
story 0
will 0
prepare 0
public 0
opinion 0
for 0
the 0
moment 0
when 0
Ecuador’s 0
rightwing 0
government 0
under 0
President 0
Lenin 0
Moreno 0
forces 0
Assange 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
embassy, 0
having 0
already 0
withdrawn 0
most 0
of 0
his 0
rights 0
to 0
use 0
digital 0
media. 0

It 0
will 0
soften 0
opposition 0
when 0
the 0
UK 0
moves 0
to 0
arrest 0
Assange 0
on 0
self-serving 0
bail 0
violation 0
charges 0
and 0
extradites 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
US. 0

And 0
it 0
will 0
pave 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
US 0
legal 0
system 0
to 0
lock 0
Assange 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time. 0

For 0
the 0
best 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
decade, 0
any 0
claims 0
by 0
Assange’s 0
supporters 0
that 0
avoiding 0
this 0
fate 0
was 0
the 0
reason 0
Assange 0
originally 0
sought 0
asylum 0
in 0
the 0
embassy 0
was 1
ridiculed 1
by 0
corporate 0
journalists, 0
not 0
least 0
at 0
the 0
Guardian. 0

Even 1
when 1
a 1
United 1
Nations 1
panel 1
of 1
experts 1
in 1
international 1
law 1
ruled 1
in 1
2016 1
that 1
Assange 1
was 1
being 1
arbitrarily 1
– 1
and 1
unlawfully 1
– 1
detained 1
by 1
the 1
UK, 1
Guardian 1
writers 1
led 1
efforts 1
to 1
discredit 1
the 1
UN 1
report. 1

See 0
here 0
and 0
here. 0

Now 0
Assange 0
and 0
his 0
supporters 0
have 0
been 0
proved 0
right 0
once 0
again. 0

An 0
administrative 0
error 0
this 0
month 0
revealed 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
justice 0
department 0
had 0
secretly 0
filed 0
criminal 0
charges 0
against 0
Assange. 0

Heavy 0
surveillance 0

The 1
problem 1
for 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
which 1
should 1
have 1
been 1
obvious 1
to 1
its 1
editors 1
from 1
the 1
outset, 1
is 1
that 1
any 1
visits 1
by 1
Manafort 1
would 1
be 1
easily 1
verifiable 1
without 1
relying 1
on 1
unnamed 1
“sources”. 1

Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
is 0
far 0
from 0
alone 0
in 0
noting 0
that 0
London 0
is 0
possibly 0
the 0
most 0
surveilled 0
city 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
with 0
CCTV 0
cameras 0
everywhere. 0

The 0
environs 0
of 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
embassy 0
are 0
monitored 0
especially 0
heavily, 0
with 0
continuous 0
filming 0
by 0
the 0
UK 0
and 0
Ecuadorian 0
authorities 0
and 0
most 0
likely 0
by 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
other 0
actors 0
with 0
an 0
interest 0
in 0
Assange’s 0
fate. 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
Manafort 0
or 0
“Russians” 1
could 0
have 0
wandered 0
into 0
the 0
embassy 0
to 0
meet 0
Assange 0
even 0
once 0
without 0
their 0
trail, 0
entry 0
and 0
meeting 0
being 0
intimately 0
scrutinised 0
and 0
recorded 0
is 0
simply 1
preposterous. 1

According 1
to 1
Greenwald: 1
“If 1
Paul 1
Manafort 1
… 1
visited 1
Assange 1
at 1
the 1
Embassy, 1
there 1
would 1
be 1
ample 1
amounts 1
of 1
video 1
and 1
other 1
photographic 1
proof 1
demonstrating 1
that 1
this 1
happened. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
provides 1
none 1
of 1
that.” 1

Former 0
British 0
ambassador 0
Craig 0
Murray 0
also 0
points 0
out 0
the 0
extensive 0
security 0
checks 0
insisted 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
embassy 0
to 0
which 0
any 0
visitor 0
to 0
Assange 0
must 0
submit. 0

Any 0
visits 0
by 0
Manafort 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
logged. 0

In 1
fact, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
obtained 1
the 1
embassy’s 1
logs 1
in 1
May, 1
and 1
has 1
never 1
made 1
any 1
mention 1
of 1
either 1
Manafort 1
or 1
“Russians” 1
being 1
identified 1
in 1
them. 1

It 1
did 1
not 1
refer 1
to 1
the 1
logs 1
in 1
its 1
latest 1
story. 1

Murray: 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
this 1
latest 1
fabrication 1
is 0
that 0
[Ecuador’s 0
President] 0
Moreno 0
had 0
already 0
released 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs 0
to 0
the 0
Mueller 0
inquiry. 0

Neither 0
Manafort 0
nor 0
these 0
“Russians” 1
are 0
in 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs 0
… 0
What 0
possible 0
motive 0
would 0
the 0
Ecuadorean 0
government 0
have 0
for 0
facilitating 0
secret 0
unrecorded 0
visits 0
by 0
Paul 0
Manafort? 0

Furthermore 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
that 0
the 0
intelligence 0
agency 0
– 0
who 0
were 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
security 0
– 0
would 0
not 0
know 0
the 0
identity 0
of 0
these 0
alleged 0
“Russians”. 1

No 1
fact-checking 1

It 1
is 1
worth 1
noting 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
vitally 1
important 1
for 1
a 1
serious 1
publication 1
like 1
the 1
Guardian 1
to 1
ensure 1
its 1
claims 1
are 1
unassailably 1
true 1
– 1
both 1
because 1
Assange’s 1
personal 1
fate 1
rests 1
on 1
their 1
veracity, 1
and 1
because, 1
even 1
more 1
importantly, 1
a 1
fundamental 1
right, 1
the 1
freedom 1
of 1
the 1
press, 1
is 1
at 1
stake. 1

Given 1
this, 1
one 1
would 1
have 1
expected 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
editors 1
to 1
have 1
insisted 1
on 1
the 1
most 1
stringent 1
checks 1
imaginable 1
before 1
going 1
to 1
press 1
with 1
Harding’s 1
story. 1

At 1
a 1
very 1
minimum, 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
sought 1
out 1
a 1
response 1
from 1
Assange 1
and 1
Manafort 1
before 1
publication. 1

Neither 1
precaution 1
was 1
taken. 1

I 1
worked 1
for 1
the 1
Guardian 1
for 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
years, 1
and 1
know 1
well 1
the 1
layers 1
of 1
checks 1
that 1
any 1
highly 1
sensitive 1
story 1
has 1
to 1
go 1
through 1
before 1
publication. 1

In 1
that 1
lengthy 1
process, 1
a 1
variety 1
of 1
commissioning 1
editors, 1
lawyers, 1
backbench 1
editors 1
and 1
the 1
editor 1
herself, 1
Kath 1
Viner, 1
would 1
normally 1
insist 1
on 1
cuts 1
to 1
anything 1
that 1
could 1
not 1
be 1
rigorously 1
defended 1
and 1
corroborated. 1

And 1
yet 1
this 1
piece 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
casually 1
waved 1
through, 1
given 1
a 1
green 1
light 1
even 1
though 1
its 1
profound 1
shortcomings 1
were 1
evident 1
to 1
a 1
range 1
of 1
well-placed 1
analysts 1
and 1
journalists 1
from 1
the 1
outset. 1

That 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
least 0
hints 0
that 0
the 0
Guardian 0
thought 0
they 0
had 0
“insurance” 0
on 0
this 0
story. 0

And 0
the 0
only 0
people 0
who 0
could 0
have 0
promised 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
insurance 0
are 0
the 0
security 0
and 0
intelligence 0
services 0
– 0
presumably 0
of 0
Britain, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
/ 0
or 0
Ecuador. 0

It 1
appears 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
simply 1
taken 1
this 1
story, 1
provided 1
by 1
spooks, 1
at 1
face 1
value. 1

Even 1
if 1
it 1
later 1
turns 1
out 1
that 1
Manafort 1
did 1
visit 1
Assange, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
clearly 1
had 1
no 1
compelling 1
evidence 1
for 1
its 1
claims 1
when 1
it 1
published 1
them. 1

That 1
is 1
profoundly 1
irresponsible 1
journalism 1
– 1
fake 1
news 1
– 1
that 1
should 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
gravest 1
concern 1
to 1
readers. 1

A 0
pattern, 0
not 0
an 0
aberration 0

Despite 1
all 1
this, 1
even 1
analysts 1
critical 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
behaviour 1
have 1
shown 1
a 1
glaring 1
failure 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
its 1
latest 1
coverage 1
represents 1
not 1
an 1
aberration 1
by 1
the 1
paper 1
but 1
decisively 1
fits 1
with 1
a 1
pattern. 1

Glenn 0
Greenwald, 0
who 0
once 0
had 0
an 0
influential 0
column 0
in 0
the 0
Guardian 0
until 0
an 0
apparent, 0
though 0
unacknowledged, 0
falling 0
out 0
with 0
his 0
employer 0
over 0
the 0
Edward 0
Snowden 0
revelations, 0
wrote 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
baffling 1
observations 1
about 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
latest 0
story. 0

First, 0
he 0
suggested 0
it 0
was 0
simply 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
long-standing 1
(and 1
well-documented) 1
hostility 1
towards 1
Assange. 1

“The 1
Guardian, 1
an 1
otherwise 1
solid 1
and 1
reliable 1
paper, 1
has 1
such 1
a 1
pervasive 1
and 1
unprofessionally 1
personal 1
hatred 1
for 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
frequently 1
dispensed 1
with 1
all 1
journalistic 1
standards 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
malign 1
him.” 1

It 1
was 1
also 1
apparently 1
evidence 1
of 1
the 1
paper’s 1
clickbait 1
tendencies: 1

“They 1
[Guardian 1
editors] 1
knew 1
that 1
publishing 1
this 1
story 1
would 1
cause 1
partisan 1
warriors 1
to 1
excitedly 1
spread 1
the 1
story, 1
and 1
that 1
cable 1
news 1
outlets 1
would 1
hyperventilate 1
over 1
it, 1
and 1
that 1
they’d 1
reap 1
the 1
rewards 1
regardless 1
of 1
whether 1
the 1
story 1
turned 1
out 1
to 1
be 1
true 1
or 1
false.” 1

And 0
finally, 0
in 0
a 1
bizarre 1
tweet, 1
Greenwald 0
opined, 0
“I 0
hope 0
the 0
story 0
[maligning 0
Assange] 0
turns 0
out 0
true” 0
– 0
apparently 1
because 1
maintenance 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
reputation 1
is 1
more 1
important 1
than 1
Assange’s 1
fate 1
and 1
the 1
right 1
of 1
journalists 1
to 1
dig 1
up 1
embarrassing 1
secrets 1
without 1
fear 1
of 1
being 1
imprisoned. 1

I 0
think 0
the 0
Guardian 0
is 0
an 0
important 0
paper 0
with 0
great 0
journalists. 0

I 0
hope 0
the 0
story 0
turns 0
out 0
true. 0

But 0
the 0
skepticism 0
over 0
this 0
story 0
is 0
very 0
widespread, 0
including 0
among 0
Assange's 1
most 1
devoted 1
haters, 1
because 0
it's 0
so 0
sketchy. 0

If 0
Manafort 0
went 0
there, 0
there's 0
video. 0

Let's 0

Deeper 0
malaise 0

What 0
this 0
misses 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Guardian’s 0
attacks 0
on 0
Assange 0
are 0
not 0
exceptional 0
or 0
motivated 0
solely 0
by 0
personal 0
animosity. 0

They 0
are 0
entirely 0
predictable 0
and 0
systematic. 0

Rather 1
than 1
being 1
the 1
reason 1
for 1
the 1
Guardian 1
violating 1
basic 1
journalistic 1
standards 1
and 1
ethics, 1
the 1
paper’s 1
hatred 1
of 1
Assange 1
is 1
a 1
symptom 1
of 1
a 1
deeper 1
malaise 1
in 1
the 1
Guardian 1
and 1
the 1
wider 1
corporate 1
media. 1

Even 1
aside 1
from 1
its 1
decade-long 1
campaign 1
against 1
Assange, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
is 1
far 1
from 1
“solid 1
and 1
reliable”, 1
as 1
Greenwald 1
claims. 1

It 1
has 1
been 1
at 1
the 1
forefront 1
of 1
the 1
relentless, 1
and 1
unhinged, 1
attacks 1
on 1
Labour 1
leader 1
Jeremy 1
Corbyn 1
for 1
prioritising 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
Palestinians 1
over 1
Israel’s 1
right 1
to 1
continue 1
its 1
belligerent 1
occupation. 1

Over 1
the 1
past 1
three 1
years, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
injected 1
credibility 1
into 1
the 1
Israel 1
lobby’s 1
desperate 1
efforts 1
to 1
tar 1
Corbyn 1
as 1
an 1
anti-semite. 1

See 0
here, 0
here 0
and 0
here. 0

Similarly, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
worked 1
tirelessly 1
to 1
promote 1
Clinton 1
and 1
undermine 1
Sanders 1
in 1
the 1
2016 1
Democratic 1
nomination 1
process 1
– 1
another 1
reason 1
the 1
paper 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
assiduous 1
in 1
promoting 1
the 1
idea 1
that 1
Assange, 1
aided 1
by 1
Russia, 1
was 1
determined 1
to 1
promote 1
Trump 1
over 1
Clinton 1
for 1
the 1
presidency. 1

The 1
Guardian’s 1
coverage 1
of 1
Latin 1
America, 1
especially 1
of 1
populist 1
leftwing 1
governments 1
that 1
have 1
rebelled 1
against 1
traditional 1
and 1
oppressive 1
US 1
hegemony 1
in 1
the 1
region, 1
has 1
long 1
grated 1
with 1
analysts 1
and 1
experts. 1

Its 1
especial 1
venom 1
has 1
been 1
reserved 1
for 1
leftwing 1
figures 1
like 1
Venezuela’s 1
Hugo 1
Chavez, 1
democratically 1
elected 1
but 1
official 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
US, 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
region’s 1
rightwing 1
authoritarians 1
beloved 1
of 1
Washington. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
has 1
been 1
vocal 1
in 1
the 1
so-called 1
“fake 1
news” 1
hysteria, 1
decrying 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
social 1
media, 1
the 1
only 1
place 1
where 1
leftwing 1
dissidents 1
have 1
managed 1
to 1
find 1
a 1
small 1
foothold 1
to 1
promote 1
their 1
politics 1
and 1
counter 1
the 1
corporate 1
media 1
narrative. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
has 1
painted 1
social 1
media 1
chiefly 1
as 1
a 1
platform 1
overrun 1
by 1
Russian 1
trolls, 1
arguing 1
that 1
this 1
should 1
justify 1
ever-tighter 1
restrictions 1
that 1
have 1
so 1
far 1
curbed 1
critical 1
voices 1
of 1
the 1
dissident 1
left 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
right. 1

Heroes 0
of 0
the 0
neoliberal 0
order 0

Equally, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
made 1
clear 1
who 1
its 1
true 1
heroes 1
are. 1

Certainly 1
not 1
Corbyn 1
or 1
Assange, 1
who 1
threaten 1
to 1
disrupt 1
the 1
entrenched 1
neoliberal 1
order 1
that 1
is 1
hurtling 1
us 1
towards 1
climate 1
breakdown 1
and 1
economic 1
collapse. 1

Its 1
pages, 1
however, 1
are 1
readily 1
available 1
to 1
the 1
latest 1
effort 1
to 1
prop 1
up 1
the 1
status 1
quo 1
from 1
Tony 1
Blair, 1
the 1
man 1
who 1
led 1
Britain, 1
on 1
false 1
pretences, 1
into 1
the 1
largest 1
crime 1
against 1
humanity 1
in 1
living 1
memory 1
– 1
the 1
attack 1
on 1
Iraq. 1

That 1
“humanitarian 1
intervention” 1
cost 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
many 1
hundreds 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
Iraqis 1
and 1
created 1
a 1
vacuum 1
that 1
destabilised 1
much 1
of 1
the 1
Middle 1
East, 1
sucked 1
in 1
Islamic 1
jihadists 1
like 1
al-Qaeda 1
and 1
ISIS, 1
and 1
contributed 1
to 1
the 1
migrant 1
crisis 1
in 1
Europe 1
that 1
has 1
fuelled 1
the 1
resurgence 1
of 1
the 1
far-right. 1

None 1
of 1
that 1
is 1
discussed 1
in 1
the 1
Guardian 1
or 1
considered 1
grounds 1
for 1
disqualifying 1
Blair 1
as 1
an 1
arbiter 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
good 1
for 1
Britain 1
and 1
the 1
world’s 1
future. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
also 1
has 1
an 1
especial 1
soft 1
spot 1
for 1
blogger 1
Elliot 1
Higgins, 1
who, 1
aided 1
by 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
has 1
shot 1
to 1
unlikely 1
prominence 1
as 1
a 1
self-styled 1
“weapons 1
expert”. 1

Like 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
Higgins 1
invariably 1
seems 1
ready 1
to 1
echo 1
whatever 1
the 1
British 1
and 1
American 1
security 1
services 1
need 1
verifying 1
“independently”. 1

Higgins 1
and 1
his 1
well-staffed 1
website 1
Bellingcat 1
have 1
taken 1
on 1
for 1
themselves 1
the 1
role 1
of 1
arbiters 1
of 1
truth 1
on 1
many 1
foreign 1
affairs 1
issues, 1
taking 1
a 1
prominent 1
role 1
in 1
advocating 1
for 1
narratives 1
that 1
promote 1
US 1
and 1
NATO 1
hegemony 1
while 1
demonising 1
Russia, 1
especially 1
in 1
highly 1
contested 1
arenas 1
such 1
as 1
Syria. 1

That 0
clear 0
partisanship 0
should 0
be 0
no 0
surprise, 0
given 0
that 0
Higgins 0
now 0
enjoys 0
an 0
“academic” 0
position 0
at, 0
and 0
funding 0
from, 0
the 0
Atlantic 0
Council, 0
a 1
high-level, 1
Washington-based 1
think-tank 1
founded 1
to 1
drum 1
up 1
support 1
for 1
NATO 1
and 1
justify 1
its 1
imperialist 1
agenda. 1

Improbably, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
adopted 1
Higgins 1
as 1
the 1
poster-boy 1
for 1
a 1
supposed 1
citizen 1
journalism 1
it 1
has 1
sought 1
to 1
undermine 1
as 1
“fake 1
news” 1
whenever 1
it 1
occurs 1
on 1
social 1
media 1
without 1
the 1
endorsement 1
of 1
state-backed 1
organisations. 1

The 1
truth 1
is 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
not 1
erred 1
in 1
this 1
latest 1
story 1
attacking 1
Assange, 1
or 1
in 1
its 1
much 1
longer-running 1
campaign 1
to 1
vilify 1
him. 1

With 1
this 1
story, 1
it 1
has 1
done 1
what 1
it 1
regularly 1
does 1
when 1
supposedly 1
vital 1
western 1
foreign 1
policy 1
interests 1
are 1
at 1
stake 1
– 1
it 1
simply 1
regurgitates 1
an 1
elite-serving, 1
western 1
narrative. 1

Its 1
job 1
is 1
to 1
shore 1
up 1
a 1
consensus 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
for 1
attacks 1
on 1
leading 1
threats 1
to 1
the 1
existing, 1
neoliberal 1
order: 1
whether 0
they 0
are 0
a 0
platform 0
like 0
Wikileaks 0
promoting 0
whistle-blowing 1
against 0
a 1
corrupt 1
western 1
elite; 1
or 0
a 0
politician 0
like 0
Jeremy 0
Corbyn 0
seeking 0
to 0
break 0
apart 0
the 0
status 0
quo 0
on 0
the 1
rapacious 1
financial 1
industries 1
or 0
Israel-Palestine; 0
or 0
a 0
radical 0
leader 0
like 0
Hugo 0
Chavez 0
who 0
threatened 0
to 0
overturn 0
a 1
damaging 1
and 1
exploitative 1
US 1
dominance 1
of 1
“America’s 1
backyard”; 1
or 0
social 0
media 0
dissidents 0
who 0
have 0
started 0
to 0
chip 0
away 0
at 0
the 1
elite-friendly 1
narratives 1
of 1
corporate 1
media, 1
including 0
the 0
Guardian. 0

The 1
Guardian 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
a 1
mistake 1
in 1
vilifying 1
Assange 1
without 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
evidence. 1

It 1
did 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
designed 1
to 1
do. 1

discussed 0

effect 0
on 0

controversies. 0

On 0
Wednesday 0

New 0
York 0
Times 0
columnist 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Villanova 0
professor 0
of 0
theology 0
Massimo 0
Faggioli 0
came 0
together 0
for 0
a 0
debate 0
entitled 0
“Francis 0
@ 0
Five: 0
Assessing 0
the 0
Legacy 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
Five 0
Years 0
after 0
His 0
Election.” 0
As 0
I 0
made 0
my 0
way 0
up 0
to 0
Fordham 0
University, 0
I 0
was 0
excited. 0

Having 0
followed 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Faggioli’s 0
ongoing 0
dialogue 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
I 0
knew 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
for 0
a 0
lively, 0
if 0
predictable, 0
conversation. 0

In 0
his 0
opening 0
remarks, 0
Douthat 0
laid 0
out 0
three 0
criteria 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
evaluate 0
Francis’s 0
papacy 0
thus 0
far: 0
his 0
impact 0
on 0
the 0
public’s 0
perception 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
(a 0
success); 0
his 0
attempts 0
at 0
reforming 0
the 0
Vatican 0
bureaucracy 0
(a 0
disappointment); 0
and 0
his 0
position 0
on 0
“moral-theological 0
controversies,” 0
specifically, 0
communion 0
for 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried 0
(a 0
problem). 0

Faggioli, 0
meanwhile, 0
outlined 0
a 1
genuinely 1
surprising 1
position. 1

Rather 0
than 0
making 0
a 0
straightforward 0
case 0
for 0
why 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
changed 0
the 0
Church 0
for 0
the 0
better, 0
Faggioli 0
rejected 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
evaluating 0
his 0
papacy 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
“continuity” 0
with 0
past 0
popes, 0
since 0
doing 0
so 0
would 0
assume 0
that 0
“Christianity 0
at 0
some 0
point 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

was 0
complete,” 0
which 0
Faggioli 0
does 0
not 0
think 0
is 0
true. 0

While 0
I 0
emphatically 0
disagree 0
with 0
this 0
argument, 0
I 0
have 0
to 0
hand 0
it 0
to 0
Faggioli: 0
From 0
the 0
outset, 0
he 0
made 0
clear 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
planning 0
to 0
debate 0
Douthat 0
on 0
the 0
implications 0
of 0
the 0
Francis 0
papacy. 0

Instead, 0
through 0
a 1
combination 1
of 1
rhetorical 1
tricks 1
and 1
soft-peddled 1
Hegelianism, 1
he 0
would 0
completely 0
redefine 0
the 0
role 0
and 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

During 0
the 0
crux 0
of 0
the 0
debate 0
— 0
the 0
discussion 0
of 0
communion 0
for 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried 0
— 0
Faggioli 0
raised 0
his 1
most 1
theologically 1
unsettling 1
point. 1

To 0
defend 0
his 0
position 0
that 0
remarried 0
persons 0
should 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
receive 0
communion, 0
Faggioli 0
invoked 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Germany, 0
where 0
50 0
percent 0
of 0
Catholic 0
marriages 0
end 0
in 0
divorce. 0

For 1
Faggioli, 1
the 1
implication 1
is 1
that 1
at 1
least 1
50 1
percent 1
of 1
German 1
Catholic 1
children 1
never 1
see 1
their 1
parents 1
receive 1
communion 1
and 1
lose 1
their 1
faith 1
because 1
of 1
it. 1

This, 0
he 0
says, 0
is 0
“bad 1
for 1
evangelization,” 1
and 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
pews 0
full, 0
the 0
Church’s 0
role 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
to 0
deny 0
communion 0
to 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried, 0
but 0
instead 0
to 0
ask, 0
“What 0
can 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
do 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
faithful 0
able 0
to 0
receive 0
sacraments?” 0

Advertisement 0

This 0
is 0
a 1
lovely 1
suggestion, 1
and 0
one 0
that 0
I’m 0
not 0
entirely 0
unsympathetic 0
to. 0

However, 0
the 0
fact 0
remains 0
that 0
Faggioli 0
is 0
suggesting 0
the 0
Church 0
do 0
much 0
more 0
than 0
provide 0
sacraments 0
to 0
the 0
faithful. 0

Just 0
before 0
invoking 0
the 0
German 0
case, 0
Faggioli 0
characterized 0
the 0
country 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
secular 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

But 0
rather 0
than 0
lamenting 0
what 0
secularism 0
has 0
wrought 0
on 0
marital 0
life 0
in 0
Germany, 0
reasserting 0
the 0
Church’s 0
position 0
on 0
marriage, 0
and 0
insisting 0
that 0
the 0
faithful 0
strive 0
to 0
live 0
according 0
to 0
her 0
laws, 0
Faggioli 0
argues 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
ought 0
to 0
bend 0
to 0
the 0
will 0
of 0
secular 0
society. 0

Advertisement 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
clear 0
to 0
anyone, 0
not 0
just 0
practicing 0
Catholics, 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
absurd. 0

If 0
the 0
Church 0
exists 0
simply 0
to 0
accommodate 0
the 0
whims 0
and 0
failures 0
of 0
secular 0
modernity, 0
then 0
what 0
is 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
the 0
Church? 0

Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
has 0
warned 0
against 0
precisely 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
“accommodation” 0
Faggioli 0
is 0
calling 0
for, 0
writing 0
that 0
when 0
“the 0
people 0
cannot 0
cope” 0
with 0
God, 0
they 0
“bring 0
him 0
down 0
into 0
their 0
own 0
world,” 0
and 0
insist 0
that 0
“he 0
must 0
be 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
God 0
that 0
[they 0
need].” 0
In 0
other 0
words, 0
“Man 0
is 0
using 0
God, 0
and, 0
in 0
reality, 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
outwardly 0
discernible, 0
he 0
is 0
placing 0
himself 0
above 0
God.” 0
To 0
fully 0
drive 0
the 0
point 0
home, 0
Benedict 0
equates 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
worship 0
with 0
the 0
Israelites 0
desert 0

Unsurprisingly, 0
this 0
progressive 0
interpretation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
doctrine 0
eventually 0
reveals 0
itself 0
to 0
be 0
rank 1
historicism. 1

Throughout 0
the 0
debate, 0
Faggioli 0
drew 0
out 0
the 0
argument 0
that 0
allowing 0
the 0
remarried 0
to 0
receive 0
communion 0
would 0
not 0
represent 0
a 0
radical 0
change 0
in 0
doctrine 0
but 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel. 0

Eventually, 0
Douthat 0
drew 0
his 0
argument 0
to 0
its 0
logical 0
conclusion 0
with 0
this 0
question: 0
Were 1
priests 1
throughout 1
history 1
in 1
fact 1
misleading 1
their 1
divorced 1
and 1
remarried 1
parishioners 1
by 1
telling 1
them 1
they 1
could 1
not 1
receive 1
communion? 1

After 0
a 0
few 0
seconds’ 0
pause, 0
Faggioli 0
gave 0
the 0
only 0
answer 0
he 0
could: 0
“There 1
are 1
different 1
responses 1
to 1
the 1
same 1
question 1
in 1
different 1
times.” 1

Throughout 0
their 0
conversation, 0
both 0
Douthat 0
and 0
Faggioli 0
repeatedly 0
observed 0
that 0
the 0
debate 0
over 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
the 0
future 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
carried 0
on 0
primarily 0
among 0
Catholic 0
intellectuals, 0
unbeknownst 0
to 0
most 0
of 0
“the 0
flock.” 0

It 0
strikes 0
me, 0
however, 0
that 0
everybody 0
— 0
Catholic 0
or 0
not 0
— 0
has 1
a 1
dog 1
in 1
this 1
fight, 1
which 0
is 0
about 0
more 0
than 0
communion 0
and 0
canon 0
law. 0

At 0
its 0
core, 0
this 0
debate 0
is 0
about 0
truth 0
and 0
our 0
ability 0
to 0
judge 0
right 0
from 0
wrong. 0

Could 1
we 1
possibly 1
say, 1
for 1
instance, 1
that 1
it’s 1
impossible 1
to 1
judge 1
the 1
presidency 1
of 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
relative 1
to 1
past 1
presidents? 1

Of 0
course 0
not 0
— 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
preposterous, 0
as 0
I’m 0
sure 0
Faggioli 0
would 0
agree. 0

To 0
pass 0
moral 0
judgements 0
on 0
papacies, 0
presidencies, 0
or 0
anything 0
else, 0
we 0
must 0
have 0
recourse 0
to 0
truth, 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
institutions 0
that 0
have 0
upheld 0
this 0
truth 0
for 0
centuries. 0

Whether 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
or 0
in 0
the 0
academy, 0
we 0
must 0
resist 0
this 0
dangerous 0
historicist 0
impulse. 0

If 1
we 1
don’t, 1
we 1
will 1
find 1
ourselves, 1
in 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
Pope 1
Benedict, 1
in 1
“a 1
dictatorship 1
of 1
relativism 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
recognize 1
anything 1
as 1
definitive 1
and 1
whose 1
ultimate 1
goal 1
consists 1
solely 1
of 1
one’s 1
own 1
ego 1
and 1
desires.” 1

On 0
Thursday 0
evening, 0
Representative 0
Scott 0
Perry 0
(R-PA) 0
appeared 0
on 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
tonight 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State 0
may 0
be 0
telling 0
the 0
truth 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
actually 0
have 0
been 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
deadly 0
attack. 0

Perry 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
can't 0
seem 0
to 0
get 0
information 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
the 0
public 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
aware 0
of, 0
something 0
that 0
was 0
brought 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
district 0
courtroom 0
earlier 0
this 0
week. 0

Additionally, 0
the 0
family 0
of 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
just 0
received 0
his 0
cremated 0
remains 0
on 0
Thursday 0
and 0
his 0
brother 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
family 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
receive 0
an 0
autopsy 0
report. 0

Why 0
is 0
that? 0

Everyone 0
who 0
was 0
killed 0
that 0
night 0
had 0
autopsies 0
and 0
those 0
have 0
been 0
released. 0

We're 0
told 0
Paddock 0
shot 0
himself 0
in 0
the 0
head, 0
right? 0

Why 1
would 1
the 1
autopsy 1
report 1
be 1
something 1
that 1
needs 1
to 1
be 1
withheld 1
from 1
the 1
public 1
or 1
his 1
family? 1

"Recently 0
I’ve 0
been 0
made 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
I 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 1
evidence 1
regarding 0
potential 0
terrorist 0
infiltration 0
through 0
the 0
southern 0
border 0
regarding 0
this 0
incident," 0
Perry 0
said. 0

"Twice 0
before 0
the 0
attack, 0
ISIS 0
warned 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
they 0
would 0
attack 0
Las 0
Vegas," 0
he 0
added. 0

"In 0
June 0
and 0
August." 0

"And 0
then 0
after 0
the 0
attack 0
claimed 0
responsibility 0
four 0
times," 0
Perry 0
continued. 0

"Something’s 1
not 1
adding 1
up." 1

"I’m 0
just 0
telling 0
you 0
I 0
have 0
received 0
what 0
I 0
feel 0
to 0
be 0
and 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
possible 0
terrorist 0
nexus," 0
Perry 0
said. 0

The 0
investigation 0
has 0
been 0
conducted 0
by 0
local 0
and 0
state 0
police, 0
not 0
the 0
feds, 0
and 0
yet, 0
they 0
continue 0
to 0
claim 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
Islamic 0
terrorist 0
involvement. 0

Yet, 0
though 0
they 0
claim 0
that 0
Paddock 0
was 0
a 0
lone 0
gunman, 0
they 0
continue 0
to 0
withhold 0
video 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
still 0
investigating 0
other 0
suspects 0
to 0
charge 0
in 0
the 0
shooting. 0

And 0
no 0
one 0
seems 0
to 0
know 0
where 0
alleged 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
guard 0
Jesus 0
Campos 0
is 0
either. 0

None 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
really 0
that 0
surprising. 0

If 0
you 0
recall, 0
we 0
reported 0
on 0
Islamic 0
terrorists 0
settling 0
into 0
Mexico 0
and 0
crossing 0
the 0
border 0
some 0
years 0
back 0
and 0
that 0
came 0
out 0
as 0
the 0
infamous 0
"Gang 0
of 0
Eight" 0
were 0
working 0
on 0
an 0
immigration 0
deal 0
and 0
had 0
rejected 0
building 0
the 0
700 0
miles 0
of 0
double-tier 0
border 0
fencing 0
Congress 0
authorized 0
just 0
seven 0
years 0
ago, 0
with 0
a 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
saying 0
they 0
didn't 0
want 0
to 0
delay 0
granting 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
legal 0
status 0
while 0
the 0
fence 0
was 0
being 0
built. 0

Three 0
years 0
prior 0
to 0
that 0
report, 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
video 0
report 0
that 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
provided 0
a 0
bit 0
of 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
Islamists 0
were 0
crossing 0
our 0
southern 0
border. 0

And 0
even 0
though 0
Islamic 0
jihadis 0
have 0
been 0
apprehended 0
on 0
our 0
border 0
in 0
2014, 0
the 0
Homeland 0
Security 0
waved 0
their 0
hand 0
and 0
said, 0
"There's 1
no 1
threat." 1

In 0
fact, 0
DHS 0
had 0
denied 0
Muslim 0
terrorists 0
were 0
crossing 0
the 0
border, 0
but 0
a 0
local 0
investigator 0
produced 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary. 0

Reports 0
indicated 0
that 0
some 0
jihadis 0
were 0
paying 0
as 0
much 0
as 0
$50,000 0
to 0
get 0
across 0
the 0
border. 0

This 0
has 0
been 0
documented 0
for 0
several 0
years 0
now. 0

It's 0
not 0
surprising. 0

What 1
is 1
surprising 1
is 1
the 1
level 1
of 1
secrecy 1
surrounding 1
the 1
Las 1
Vegas 1
shooting 1
and 1
the 1
containment 1
of 1

three 1
months 1
after 1

occurred. 1

her 0
feet 0
while 0

for 0

that 0

with 0

to 0

determine 0

Monahan's 0
shifting 0
rationale 0
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
produce 0
the 0

including 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
lost, 0
was 0

would 0
be 0
too 0

traumatic 0
to 0

it. 0

The 0

Ellison 0

have 0
put 0

they 0
speak 0
out 0

Monahan 0

slammed 0

for 0
its 0
response 0
to 0
her 0
allegations 0
when 0
compared 0
to 0
its 0
treatment 0
of 0
Christine 0

Ford 0
has 0
accused 0

of 0

force 0
himself 0
onto 0
her 0
during 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
party 0
nearly 0
four 0
decades 0

Many 0

have 0
supported 0
Ford’s 0

“No, 0

they 0
don't,” 0
Monahan 0
tweeted 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
of 0
whether 0
the 0
party 0
believes 0
women’s 0
stories. 0

“I've 0
been 0
smeared, 0
threatened, 0
isolated 0
from 0
my 0
own 0
party. 0

I 0
provided 0

records 0
from 0

stating 0
on 0
two 0
different 0
Dr. 0

Visits, 0
I 0
told 0

about 0

it. 0

My 0

I 0
have 0

She 0

added: 0
“Four 0

at 0

stated 0
that 0
I 0

to 0
them 0

The 0
department 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
note 0
that 0
Guyger 0
could 0
appeal 0
this 0
firing 0
under 0
their 0
civil 0
service 0
rules. 0

Officer 0
Guyger 0
was 0
terminated 0
for 0
her 0
actions. 0

She 0
was 0
hired 0
in 0
November 0
2013 0
and 0
was 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
Southeast 0
Patrol 0
Division. 0

Under 0
civil 0
service 0
rules, 0
Officer 0
Guyger 0
has 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
appeal 0
her 0
discipline. 0

This 0
move 0
is 0
noteworthy 0
as 0
the 0
department 0
has 0
been 0
standing 0
up 0
against 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
the 0
officer 0
to 0
be 0
fired. 0

As 0
recently 0
as 0
Friday, 0
Hall 0
refused 0
to 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
saying 0
in 0
part, 0
“There 0
is 0
one 0
overriding 0
reason 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
not 0
taken 0
any 0
administrative 0
or 0
employment 0
action 0
against 0
Officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
the 0
on-going 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
into 0
her 0
actions.” 0

Also, 0
in 0
a 0
town 0
hall 0
meeting 0
last 0
week, 0
Hall 0
again 0
stood 0
behind 0
her 0
choice 0
to 0
refuse 0
to 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
claiming 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

“I 0
can’t 0
do 0
that 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
both 0
local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
that 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action. 0

There 0
are 0
civil 0
service 0
laws 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
adhere 0
to,” 0
said 0
Hall. 0

Apparently, 0
it 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

This 0
news 0
will 0
likely 0
be 0
well 0
received 0
by 0
the 0
Jean 0
family 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
activists 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
justice 0
for 0
Botham 0
since 0
the 0
beginning. 0

As 0
TFTP 0
previously 0
reported, 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
not 0
firing 0
Guyger 0
seemed 0
utterly 1
preposterous 1
as 0
she 0
admitted 0
to 0
doing 0
something 0
wrong. 0

While 0
controversy 0
swarms 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
why 0
she 0
may 0
have 0
killed 0
Jean, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
kill 0
him. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

This 0
public 0
servant 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
innocent 1
man’s 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
dead. 0

Because 0
of 0
her 0
actions, 0
this 0
man 0
no 0
longer 0
lives. 0

This 0
alone 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
enough 0
to 0
fire 0
her. 0

Surprisingly 0
enough, 0
NRA 0
spokesperson 0
Dana 0
Loesch 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
firing 0
of 0
Guyger 0
with 0
one 0
word, 0
“Good,” 0
showing 0
her 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
move. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
don’t 0
recall, 0
Loesch 0
sparked 0
controversy 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
by 0
claiming 0
that 0
if 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
were 0
a 0
gun 0
owner, 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
alive 0
today. 0

Indeed, 0
as 0
TFTP 0
reported 0
over 0
the 0
weekend, 0
a 0
father 0
in 0
Prince 0
George’s 0
County 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
officers 0
as 0
they 0
wrongly 0
entered 0
his 0
apartment. 0

He 0
shot 0
two 0
officers. 0

Not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
not 0
arrested, 0
but 0
the 0
police 0
chief 0
praised 0
him 0
and 0
apologized. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
termination, 0
the 0
family’s 0
attorney, 0
Lee 0
Merritt 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
family 0
expressed 0
“satisfaction” 0
with 0
the 0
move. 0

“The 0
Jean 0
family 0
expressed 0
satisfaction 0
in 0
this 0
explanation 0
and 0
in 0
Guyger’s 0
termination. 0

We 0
see 0
it 0
as 0
an 0
initial 0
victory 0
— 0
well 0
received 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
Botham 0

in 0
his 0
native 0
country 0
in 0

Merritt’s 0

in 0

that 0

in 0

has 0

and 0
Swedes 0
are 0

that 0

In 0

for 0
which 0

available, 0
106 0

in 0
Sweden, 0
a 0
country 0
of 0
10 0

But 0

Swedish 0

over 0

mostly 0
in 0

Oakland 0

the 0

when 0
she 0
issued 0
a 0
tweet 0
and 0
press 0
release 0
on 0
February 0
24 0
warning 0
about 0

Schaaf 0
refuses 0
to 0
say 0
how 0
she 0
learned 0
about 0
the 0
ICE 0
raids, 0
only 0
saying 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
from 0
official 0

“I 0
felt 0
that 0
it 0

Schaaf 0
said. 0

before 0

hours 0
before 0

a 0
group 0
called 0
Centro 0
Legal 0
de 0

sent 0
the 0

information 0
on 0
what 0
employers 0
should 0
do 0
in 0
case 0
of 0
an 0
ICE 0

Hours 0
before 0
the 0
public 0
was 0
warned 0
about 0
ICE 0
raids, 0
some 0
Oakland 0
businesses 0
got 0
a 0
head 0
start, 0
thanks 0
to 0
the 0
mayor. 0

According 0
to 0
emails, 0
the 0
Oakland 0
Indie 0
Alliance, 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
independent 0

got 0
a 0

saying 0
“Important 0

“This 0

Now 0
that 0

there 1
is 1
no 1

that 1

It 0
is 0

to 0

to 0

or 0
to 0

in 0
the 0

An 0

of 0

INS 0

or 0
taking 0

that 0
facilitate 0
the 0

Well, 1
all 1
of 1
this 1

the 1
thing, 1
while 1
this 1

you 1

reminded 1
that 1
for 1

at 1

22 1

jihadi 1
camps 1
have 1
existed 1
on 1

maybe 1
not 1
so 1
watchful, 1

be 1
thrown 1

when 1
dealing 1
with 1
those 1
who 1
take 1
the 1

have 0
accused 0
Francis 0
and 0
his 0
two 0
predecessors, 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
of 0
failing 0
to 0
aggressively 0
weed 0
out 0
and 0
punish 0
predator 0
priests. 0

Here’s 0
a 0
look 0
what 0
drove 0
the 0
panel’s 0
creation 0
and 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

What 0
is 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
commission 0
on 0
sexual 0
abuse? 0

Following 0
criticism 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
focusing 0
on 0
halting 0
child 0
abuse 0
within 0
the 0
church, 0
Francis 0
created 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Commission 0
for 0
the 0
Protection 0
of 0
Minors 0
in 0
March 0
2014, 0
naming 0
Cardinal 0
Sean 0
O’Malley, 0
the 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Boston, 0
to 0
run 0
it. 0

O’Malley 0
was 0
not 0
only 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
“G9” 0
group 0
of 0
close 0
advisors; 0
he 0
was 0
also 0
the 0
man 0
who 0
sought 0
to 0
clean 0
up 0
the 0
abuse 0
scandal 0
in 0
Boston 0
after 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
his 0
predecessor, 0
Cardinal 0
Bernard 0
Law, 0
whose 0
shifting 0
of 0
predator 0
priests 0
to 0
new 0
posts 0
was 0
exposed 0
by 0
the 0
Boston 0
Globe 0
and 0
chronicled 0
in 0
the 0
movie 0
“Spotlight.” 0

The 0
revelations 0
about 0
Law, 0
who 0
died 0
in 0
December, 0
emboldened 0
abuse 0
victims 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
and 0
world, 0
who 0
began 0
speaking 0
up 0
about 0
the 0
priests 0
who 0
had 0
molested 0
them. 0

When 0
he 0
created 0
the 0
commission, 0
Francis 0
said: 0
“The 0
commission’s 0
specific 0
task 0
is 0
to 0
propose 0
to 0
me 0
the 0
most 0
opportune 0
initiatives 0
for 0
protecting 0
minors 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
adults, 0
in 0
order 0
that 0
we 0
may 0
do 0
everything 0
possible 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
crimes 0
such 0
as 0
those 0
which 0
have 0
occurred 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
repeated 0
in 0
the 0
Church.” 0

Why 0
is 0
it 0
being 0
renewed 0
now? 0

After 0
the 0
commission’s 0
three-year 0
mandate 0
expired 0
in 0
December, 0
Francis 0
relaunched 0
it 0
on 0
Feb. 0
17 0
with 0
some 0
members 0
reappointed 0
and 0
nine 0
new 0
members 0
added, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
are 0
victims 0
of 0
abuse, 0
although 0
the 0
Vatican 0
declined 0
to 0
say 0
which, 0
opting 0
to 0
respect 0
their 0
privacy. 0

O’Malley 0
returns 0
as 0
chief. 0

New 0
members 0
come 0
from 0
Australia, 0
Brazil, 0
Ethiopia, 0
India, 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
and 0
Tonga, 0
"reflecting 0
the 0
global 0
reach 0
of 0
the 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
challenge 0
of 0
creating 0
safeguarding 0
structures 0
in 0
diverse 0
cultural 0
context,” 0
the 0
Vatican 0
said. 0

What 0
did 0
the 0
first 0
commission 0
achieve? 0

The 0
Vatican 0
has 0
said 0
it 0
“worked 0
with 0
almost 0
200 0
dioceses 0
and 0
religious 0
communities 0
worldwide 0
to 0
raise 0
awareness 0
and 0
to 0
educate 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
safeguarding 0
in 0
our 0
homes, 0
parishes, 0
schools, 0
hospitals, 0
and 0
other 0
institutions.” 0

What 0
didn’t 0
it 0
do? 0

Commission 0
members 0
quickly 0
realized 0
they 0
needed 0
to 0
go 0
beyond 0
raising 0
awareness 0
and 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
bishops 0
who 0
quietly 0
shift 0
offenders 0
to 0
new 0
dioceses 0
when 0
they 0
are 0
exposed 0
as 0
molesters 0
and 0
rapists. 0

Even 0
if 0
church 0
laws 0
already 0
existed 0
to 0
hold 0
bishops 0
accountable 0
for 0
their 0
priests’ 0
behavior, 0
those 0
strictures 0
were 0
not 0
enough, 0
O’Malley 0
said 0
in 0
2014. 0

“There 0
are, 0
theoretically 0
I 0
guess, 0
canons 0
that 0
could 0
apply 0
here, 0
but 0
obviously 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
been 0
sufficient,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
commission 0
was 0
behind 0
Francis’ 0
decision 0
in 0
2015 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
new 0
tribunal 0
to 0
judge 0
bishops 0
caught 0
covering 0
up 0
for 0
abusive 1
priests, 1
and 0
to 0
fund 0
it 0
for 0
five 0
years. 0

But 0
amid 0
myriad 0
legal 0
questions 0
over 0
what 0
exact 0
powers 0
the 0
court 0
would 0
have, 0
it 0
never 0
got 0
off 0
the 0
ground. 0

In 0
2016, 0
Francis 0
officially 0
killed 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
create 0
it, 0
issuing 0
a 0
document 0
that 0
essentially 0
called 0
on 0
using 0
existing 0
procedures 0
to 0
tackle 0
the 0
problem. 0

Francis 0
was 0
also 0
criticized 0
when 0
Australian 0
Cardinal 0
George 0
Pell, 0
whom 0
he 0
had 0
brought 0
to 0
Rome 0
to 0
clean 0
up 0
Vatican 0
finances, 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
return 0
to 0
Australia 0
last 0
year 0
to 0
face 0
charges 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

Any 0
other 0
problems? 0

Commission 0
members 0
said 0
bishops 0
should 0
call 0
the 0
police 0
when 0
they 0
discovered 0
predator 1
priests, 1
rather 0
than 0
phone 0
the 0
nearest 0
religious 0
retreat 0
to 0
“park” 1
the 1
priest 1
out 1
of 1
harm’s 1
way. 1

But 0
this 0
simple 0
message 0
was 0
hard 0
to 0
get 0
across. 0

It 0
emerged 0
that 0
during 0
a 0
Vatican 0
training 0
course 0
for 0
new 0
bishops 0
in 0
September 0
2015 0
a 0
French 0
priest 0
informed 0
bishops 0
they 0
had 0
no 0
obligation 0
to 0
report 0
abuse 0
to 0
the 0
police, 0
forcing 0
the 0
commission 0
to 0
issue 0
a 0
strong 0
statement 0
saying 0
bishops 0
had 0
every 0
obligation 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Did 0
commission 0
members 0
persevere? 0

Not 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

British 0
member 0
Peter 0
Saunders, 0
a 0
former 0
victim 0
of 0
priestly 0
abuse, 0
was 0
ousted 0
in 0
2016. 0

He 0
said 0
the 0
group 0
was 0
a 0
toothless, 1
paper-shuffling 1
exercise. 1

Irish 0
member 0
Marie 0
Collins, 0
another 0
victim, 0
resigned 0
in 0
March 0
last 0
year 0
and 0
said 0
Vatican 0
bureaucrats 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
comply 0
with 0
the 0
commission’s 0
request 0
— 0
approved 0
by 0
the 0
pope 0
— 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
all 0
letters 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
by 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

Marie 0
Collins, 0
then 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
pope's 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
in 0
2015 0
hands 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Sean 0
O'Malley 0
detailing 0
the 0
abuse 0
suffered 0
by 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz 0
of 0
Chile. 0

Catherine 0
Bonnet 0
/ 0
Associated 0
Press 0

Was 0
the 0
pope 0
listening 0
to 0
the 0
commission? 0

Possibly 0
not. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Collins 0
handed 0
O’Malley 0
a 0
letter 0
addressed 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
from 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
a 0
Chilean 0
abused 0
as 0
a 0
boy 0
by 0
Chilean 0
prelate 0
Fernando 0
Karadima, 0
who 0
was 0
sentenced 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
to 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
penance 0
in 0
2010. 0

Cruz 0
described 0
how 0
the 0
abuse 0
was 0
witnessed 0
and 0
covered 0
up 0
by 0
Juan 0
Barros, 0
a 0
priest 0
whose 0
appointment 0
as 0
a 0
bishop 0
in 0
2015 0
prompted 0
huge 0
protests 0
in 0
Chile. 0

The 0
pope 0
has 0
stuck 0
by 0
Barros, 0
dismissing 0
the 0
protesters 0
as 0
“lefties” 1
and 0
hugging 0
Barros 0
publicly 0
during 0
his 0
visit 0
to 0
Chile 0
last 0
month. 0

"I 0
can't 0
condemn 0
[Barros] 0
because 0
I 0
don't 0
have 0
evidence," 0
he 0
said 0
on 0
the 0
plane 0
back 0
to 0
Rome, 0
suggesting 0
he 0
had 0
ignored 0
or 0
never 0
read 0
the 0
letter 0
from 0
Cruz. 0

That 0
was 0
too 0
much 0
for 0
O’Malley, 0
who 0
said 0
Francis 0
had 1
caused 1
"great 1
pain” 1
to 1
victims. 1

If 1
Francis 1
was 1
not 1
listening 1
to 1
the 1
commission 1
about 1
Barros, 1
whom 1
was 1
he 1
listening 1
to? 1

Vatican 0
watchers 0
believe 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
influenced 0
by 0
Chilean 0
Cardinal 0
Francisco 0
Javier 0
Errazuriz, 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
G9 0
group 0
who 0
has 0
backed 0
Barros 0
and 0
reportedly 0
helped 0
block 0
moves 0
to 0
make 0
Cruz 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission. 0

So 0
is 0
the 0
pope 0
intransigent 0
on 0
Barros? 0

No. 0

Something 0
changed 0
his 0
mind 0
after 0
his 0
Chilean 0
trip, 0
possibly 0
the 0
scale 0
of 0
the 0
protest 0
against 0
Barros 0
in 0
the 0
country. 0

On 0
Feb. 0
17, 0
he 0
sent 0
a 0
senior 0
Vatican 0
sex 0
abuse 0
investigator, 0
Archbishop 0
Charles 0
Scicluna, 0
to 0
New 0
York 0
to 0
interview 0
Cruz, 0
who 0
now 0
lives 0
in 0
Philadelphia. 0

"For 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
felt 0
that 0
someone 0
is 0
listening," 0
Cruz 0
said 0
after 0
the 0
meeting. 0

What 0
happens 0
next? 0

“This 0
should 0
lead 0
to 0
Barros 0
stepping 0
down,” 0
said 0
Saunders, 0
who 0
is 0
forming 0
his 0
own 0
campaign 0
group 0
with 0
Cruz 0
and 0
others 0
to 0
fight 0
clerical 0
abuse. 0

The 0
new 0
papal 0
commission 0
will 0
meanwhile 0
hold 0
its 0
first 0
meeting 0
in 0
April. 0

20 0
Years 0

The 0
first 0
American 0
citizen 0
to 0
be 0
convicted 0
of 0
successfully 0
joining 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State 0
has 0
been 0
sentenced 0
to 0
20 0
years 0
in 0
prison. 0

Mohamad 0
Khweis, 0
unlike 0
the 0
dozens 0
of 0
other 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
who 0
failed 0
to 0
join 0
ISIS 0
and 0
were 0
subsequently 0
charged, 0
actually 0
made 0
it 0
to 0
Syria, 0
but 0
after 0
just 0
three 0
months 0
tried 0
to 0
escape 0
and 0
was 0
captured 0
by 0
Kurdish 0
forces, 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reports. 0

Khweis 0
is 0
an 0
interesting 0
case 0
for 0
numerous 0
reasons. 0

First, 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
particular 0
event 0
or 0
friend 0
who 0
ignited 0
his 0
radicalization. 0

Second, 0
he 0
successfully 0
made 0
it 0
to 0
Syria 0
via 0
Turkey. 0

And 0
third, 0
he 0
came 0
from 0
a 0
secular 0
home 0
that 0
was 0
stable. 0

His 0
life 0
before 0
joining 0
the 0
caliphate 0
was 0
unremarkable. 0

He 0
obtained 0
an 0
associate’s 0
degree 0
in 0
criminal 0
justice 0
and 0
worked 0
as 0
a 0
bus 0
driver 0
in 0
Alexandria, 0
Va. 0

He 0
also 0
abused 0
marijuana 0
over 0
the 0
past 0
few 0
years. 0

Khweis’ 0
defense 0
attorney 0
said 0
Friday 0
that 0
even 0
he 0
has 0
no 0
idea 0
what 0
caused 0
Khweis 0
to 0
join 0
ISIS. 0

“It’s 0
difficult 0
to 0
understand,” 0
defense 0
attorney 0
John 0
Zwerling 0
said 0
Friday. 0

“We 0
don’t 0
really 0
know 0
what 0
caused 0
him 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
Syria.” 0

From 0
the 0
very 0
start 0
of 0
his 0
trial, 0
Khweis 0
said 0
he 0
regretted 0
his 0
actions 0
and 0
said 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
join 0
ISIS 0
in 0
December 0
2015 0
was 0
a 0
drunken 1
one. 1

“I 0
hated 0
myself 0
for 0
making 0
the 0
worst 0
decision 0
I 0
ever 0
made,” 0
Khweis 0
wrote 0
to 0
the 0
judge 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

“I 0
ruined 1
my 1
life 1
and 1
my 1
family’s 1
life.” 1

Prosecutors, 0
who 0
pushed 0
for 0
35 0
years 0
in 0
prison, 0
accused 0
Khweis 0
of 0
lying 0
repeatedly 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
15 0
months 0
of 0
the 0
trial. 0

When 0
Khweis 0
was 0
first 0
captured 0
in 0
Iraq 0
in 0
March 0
2016, 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
FBI 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
following 0
a 0
young 0
woman. 0

However, 0
that 0
young 0
woman 0
didn’t 0
exist. 0

“This 0
defendant 0
executed 1
his 1
plan 1
to 1
perfection,” 1
prosecutor 0
Dennis 0
Fitzpatrick 0
said. 0

“He 0
got 0
into 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State. 0

He 0
was 0
in 0
their 0
machinery. 0

He 1
was 1
providing 1
himself 1
and 1
his 1
services 1
to 1
the 1
organization.” 1

U.S. 0

Robert 0

issued 0
the 0
order 0
a 0
day 0
after 0
eight 0

to 0
block 0
a 0
settlement 0
reached 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0

last 0

allowing 0
a 0

company, 0
Defense 0

to 0
resume 0
online-sharing 0
of 0
blueprints 0
for 0

blocks 0
the 0

until 0
the 0
next 0

on 0

10. 0

In 0
the 0

urged 0
President 0

to 0
reverse 0
the 0
decision 0
letting 0
Defense 0

the 0

Trump 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he's 0
"looking 0

the 0
idea, 0
saying 0
making 0
3D 0
plastic 0

"doesn't 0

murder 1
their 0

in 0
their 0
wombs 0
in 0
the 0
most 1
brutal 1
and 1
barbaric 1
fashion, 0
and 0
then 0
sell 0
off 0
their 0
body 0
parts 0
for 0
profit, 0
if 0
they 0
don't 0
throw 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
trash 0
or 0
flush 0
them 0
down 0
a 0

The 0
eight 0

the 0
usual 0

along 0
with 0
the 0

claims 0
the 0
settlement 0
is: 0

...in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
Administrative 0
Procedure 0
Act....there 0
is 0
no 0
indication 0
in 0
the 0
settlement 0
agreement 0
or 0
elsewhere 0
that 0
any 0
analysis, 0
study 0
or 0
determination 0
was 0
made 0
by 0
the 0
government 0
defendants 0
in 0
consultation 0
with 0
other 0
agencies, 0
before 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
agreed 0
to 0
lift 0
export 0
controls 0
on 0
the 0
downloadable 0
guns. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
agreement 0
states 0
that 0
it 0
"does 0
not 0
reflect 0
any 0
agreed-upon 0
purpose 0
other 0
than 0
the 0
desire 0
of 0
the 0
Parties 0
to 0

and 0
to 0
resolve 0
the 0
Action 0
without 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
expense 0
of 0
further 0
litigation." 0

The 0
lawsuit 0
also 0
argues 0
the 0
settlement 0
violates 0
the 0
Tenth 0
Amendment 0
by 0
infringing 0
on 0
states' 0
rights 0
to 0
regulate 0
firearms. 0

Washington 0
has 0
a 0
robust 0
regulatory 0
system 0
meant 0
to 0
keep 0
firearms 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
dangerous 0
individuals. 0

That 0
system 0
is 0
jeopardized 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration's 0
action 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
undermined 0
by 0
the 0
distribution 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed's 0
downloadable 0
guns. 0

Note 0
that 0
Ferguson 0
forgets 0
that 0
the 0
Tenth 0
Amendment 0
states 0
plainly: 0

The 0
powers 0
not 0
delegated 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
by 0
the 0
Constitution, 0
nor 0
prohibited 0
by 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
States, 0
are 0
reserved 0
to 0
the 0
States 0
respectively, 0
or 0
to 0
the 0
people. 0

(emphasis 0
mine) 0

Since 0
our 0
founders 0
clearly 0
said 0
that 0
our 0
rights 0
come 0
from 0
our 0
Creator, 0
and 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
the 0
"right 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
bear 0
arms 0
shall 0
not 0
be 0
infringed," 0
I 0
truly 0
wonder 0
where 0
he 0
gets 0
this 0
idea 0
the 0
state 0
has 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
do 0
just 0
that, 0
infringe 1
on 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
by 1
regulating 1
firearms. 1

he 0
is 0
reading 0
something 0
into 0
it 0
that 0
is 0
simply 0
not 0
there, 0
but 0
that's 0
a 0
Communist 1
ideology 0
you 0
are 0
seeing 0
there, 0
not 0
an 0
American 1
one. 0

Josh 0
Blackman, 0
one 0
of 0
Defense 0

lawyers, 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
today 0
that 0
"The 0
District 0

Washington 0
already 0
approved 0
the 0

This 0

another 0

on 0
a 0

that 0

in 0

As 0
reported 0
yesterday, 0
Defense 0

is 0
already 0
embroiled 0
in 0
its 0
own 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
New 0

and 0
Los 0

over 0
those 0

and 0
simultaneously 0
is 0
fighting 0
Pennsylvania's 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
temporary 0

(Both 0

part 0
of 0
today's 0
federal 0

filed 0
in 0
the 0
Western 0
District 0
of 0
Washington.) 0

While 0
the 0
various 0
court 0
filings 0
about 0
this 0
continue 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
August 0
1 0
is 0
the 0
date 0
on 0
which 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
will 0
begin 0
distributing 0
the 0

again, 0
the 0
settlement 0
legally 0
permits 0
them 0
to 0
do—the 0
distribution 0
is 0
already 0
happening. 0

Cody 0

already 0
fundraising 0
off 0
the 0

Twitter. 0

He 0
told 0
me 0
five 0
years 0
ago, 0
when 0
I 0
was 0
writing 0
a 0
feature 0
story 0
on 0
the 0
beginnings 0
of 0
his 0
fight 0
with 0
the 0
government 0
over 0
gun-making 0
files, 0
that 0
"This 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
continuous 0
process 0
of 0
different 0
levels 0
of 0
authority 0
figures 0
trying 0
to 0
stop 0
it 0

thus 0

we 0

succeed—because 0
you 0
all 0

trying 0

me. 0

That 0
seemed 0
natural 0
and 0
ended 0
up 0
being 0
true." 0

So 0
far, 0
that 0
has 0
continued 0
to 0
be 0
true. 0

This 1
federal 1
judge 1
should 1
know 1
what 1
the 1

should 0
have 0

Today 0
I 0
received 0
an 0
email 0
from 0
a 0
monastery 0
of 0
cloistered 0
Carmelite 0
nuns 0
about 0
the 0
new 0
document 0
from 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious. 0

They’re 0
helping 0
me 0
examine 0
this 0
document, 0
having 0
kindly 0
volunteered 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
consultants, 0
to 0
help 0
me 0
understand 0
it 0
from 0
an 0
inside 0
position. 0

These, 0
I 0
might 0
add, 0
are 0
not 0
what 0
we 0
would 0
consider 0
a 0
“traditionalist” 0
community. 0

They 0
have 0
only 0
the 0
Novus 0
Ordo 0
Mass 0
and 0
use 0
the 0
new 0
rite 0
Divine 0
Office 0
in 0
their 0
native 0
vernacular 0
language. 0

For 0
obvious 0
reasons 0
I 0
can’t 0
identify 0
them, 0
even 0
to 0
say 0
what 0
country 0
they 0
are 0
in. 0

Writing 0
to 0
me 0
in 0
English, 0
by 0
way 0
of 0
introductory 0
comments 0
in 0
their 0
longer 0
analysis 0
of 0
the 0
document 0
that 0
will 0
be 0
forthcoming, 0
Sister 0
T, 0
fully 0
professed 0
and 0
a 0
senior 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
monastery’s 0
council, 0
said, 0
“The 0
Cor 0
Orans 0
document 0
is 0
the 0
death-knell 1
of 0
Carmel. 0

It 0
signals 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
contemplative 0
monastic 0
life. 0

Not 0
only 0
does 0
it 0
destroy 1
the 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
Monasteries, 0
something 0
Our 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
was 0
extremely 0
insistent 0
about, 0
but 0
it 0
also 0
removes 0
the 0
Superior, 0
dissolves 0
her 0
authority 0
and 0
power, 0
removes 0
the 0
financial 0
independence 0
of 0
each 0
Monastery, 0
and 0
destroys 0
the 0
specificity 0
of 0
each 0
charism. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
disaster. 1

Especially 0
for 0
Carmel.” 0

I 0
contrast 0
this 0
frightening 1
comment 0
with 0
those 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
man 0
immediately 0
responsible 0
for 0
“Cor 0
orans,” 0
Cardinal 0
João 0
Braz 0
de 0
Aviz, 0
the 0
Brazilian 0
prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Institutes 0
of 0
Consecrated 0
Life 0
and 0
Societies 0
of 0
Apostolic 0
Life 0
in 0
a 0
speech 0
to 0
religious 0
formation 0
directors 0
in 0
2015, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
laid 0
out 0
pretty 0
clearly 0
what 0
was 0
coming 0
in 0
this 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation, 0
3 0
years 0
later. 0

In 0
fact, 0
as 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter 0
piece 0
said, 0
the 0
meeting 0
itself 0
was 0
“unprecedented,” 0
1200 0
formators 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
gathered 0
by 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
hear 0
the 0
new 0
marching 0
orders. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
programme: 0

“Do 0
not 0
distance 0
yourself 0
from 0
the 0
great 0
lines 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council.” 0
“In 0
fact, 0
those 1
that 1
are 1
distancing 1
themselves 1
from 1
the 1
council 1
to 1
make 1
another 1
path 1
are 1
killing 1
themselves 1
– 0
sooner 1
or 1
later, 1
they 1
will 1
die. 1

They 0
will 0
not 0
have 0
sense. 0

They 1
will 1
be 1
outside 1
the 1
church. 1

We 0
need 0
to 0
build, 0
using 0
the 0
Gospel 0
and 0
the 0
Council 0
as 0
a 0
departure 0
point.” 0

After 0
breathing 0
this 0
threat, 0
the 0
cardinal 0
continued, 0
saying 0
that 0
because 0
modern 0
people’s 0
“needs” 0
are 0
fundamentally 0
different 0
from 0
what 0
they 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
reason 0
to 0
stick 0
too 0
closely 0
to 0
what 0
the 0
founders 0
and 0
foundresses 0
– 0
people 0
like 0
St. 0
Anthony, 0
St. 0
Augustine, 0
St. 0
John 0
Cassian, 0
St. 0
Benedict, 0
St. 0
Bruno, 0
St. 0
Dominic, 0
Sts. 0

Francis 0
and 0
Clare, 0
Sts. 0

Teresa 0
of 0
Avila 0
and 0
John 0
of 0
the 0
Cross 0
- 0
wanted. 0

“These 0
contexts 0
have 0
changed. 0

And 0
the 0
council 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
consecrated 0
life 0
must 0
be 0
Christian 0
discipleship 0
... 0
must 0
be 0
discipleship 0
of 0
the 0
founders 0
that 0
we 0
remember, 0
but 0
also 0
must 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
culture 0
of 0
the 0
present 0
moment.” 0

“We 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
closed 0
to 0
new 0
things. 0

God 0
is 0
not 0
static,” 0
the 0
cardinal 0
said. 0

“God 0
is 0
always 0
new 0
movement 0
– 0
of 0
light, 0
of 0
heat, 0
of 0
demonstration. 0

He 0
speaks 0
in 0
every 0
time 0
to 0
men 0
and 0
women 0
with 0
the 0
true 0
language 0
of 0
that 0
time.” 0

The 0
congregation’s 0
Secretary, 0
Archbishop 0
José 0
Rodríguez 0
Carballo, 0
is 0
reported 0
as 0
saying, 0
“With 0
this 0
explicit 0
reference 0
to 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
we 0
point 0
to 0
our 0
profound 0
conviction 0
that 0
the 0
council 0
is 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
reference, 0
non-negotiable, 0
in 0
the 0
formation 0
to 0
the 0
consecrated 0
life.” 0

Not 0
the 0
charism 0
of 0
the 0
order, 0
nor 0
the 0
rule, 0
nor 0
the 0
Patristic 0
tradition, 0
nor 0
the 0
Doctors, 0
nor 0
the 0

the 1
most 1
virulently 1
anti-Catholic 1
organisation 1
of 1
“Catholic” 1
religious 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
– 0
and 0
by 0
his 0
vicious 0
persecution 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscans 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate. 0

Carballo 0
continues 0
his 0
remarks, 0
giving 0
us 0
a 0
clue 0
as 0
to 0
his 0
feelings 0
towards 0
strictly 0
cloistered, 0
contemplative 0
religious 0
life: 0
“A 0
consecrated 0
life, 0
a 0
life 0
in 0
God 0
but 0
inserted 0
in 0
the 0
ecclesial 0
family, 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
– 0
inserted 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

Not 0
in 0
conflict 0
with 0
the 0
world, 0
but 0
inserted 0
in 0
continuity,” 0
he 0
said. 0

It 0
is 0
to 0
wonder 0
what 0
this 0
man 0
would 0
make 0
of 0
a 0
comment 0
by 0
the 0
great 0
Dom 0
Paul 0
Delatte, 0
the 0
second 0
abbot 0
of 0
Solesmes 0
and 0
successor 0
to 0
the 0
refounder, 0
Dom 0
Gueranger, 0
who 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
commentary 0
on 0
the 0
Rule 0
of 0
St. 0
Benedict: 0

“The 0
Prologue 0
set 0
this 0
choice 0
before 0
us, 0
the 0
world 0
or 0
Our 0
Lord, 0
as 0
mutually 1
exclusive 1
alternatives; 1
we 0
cannot 0
remain 0
neutral, 0
but 0
must 0
belong 0
wholly 0
to 0
the 0
one 0
or 0
wholly 0
to 0
the 0
other.” 0

“After 0
entering 0
into 0
Christ 0
by 0
baptism 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
monastic 0
profession, 0
we 0
should 0
hold 0
ourselves 0
as 0
far 0
aloof 0
from 0
the 0
world 0
as 0
possible 0
and 0
have 0
no 0
connection 0
with 0
it. 0

There 0
shall 0
no 0
longer 0
be 0
more 0
intercourse 0
between 0
us 0
than 0
there 0
is 0
between 0
two 0
corpses: 0
‘The 0
world 0
is 0
crucified 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
I 0
to 0
the 0
world.’ 0

“Let 0
us 0
be 0
on 0
our 0
guard 0
against 0
thinking 0
that 0
it 0
may 0
sometimes 0
be 0
proper 0
to 0
soften 0
the 0
differences, 0
to 0
lessen 0
the 0
distance 0
which 0
separates 0
us. 0

The 0
Apostle 0
warns 0
us 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
only 0
please 0
God 0
by 0
preserving 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
our 0
true 0
life: 0
‘No 0
man 0
being 0
a 0
soldier 0
to 0
God, 0
entangleth 0
himself 0
with 0
secular 0
businesses: 0
that 0
he 0
may 0
please 0
him 0
to 0
whom 0
he 0
hath 0
engaged 0
himself.’ 0
The 0
world 0
itself 0
is 0
scandalised 0
by 0
our 0
condescending 0
to 0
it, 0
and 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
Imitation 0
[of 0
Christ] 0
are 0
always 0
fulfilled: 0
‘Sometimes 0
we 0
think 0
to 0
please 0
others 0
by 0
our 0
company; 0
whereas 0
we 0
begin 0
rather 0
to 0
be 0
displeasing 0
to 0
them 0
by 0
reason 0
of 0
the 0
bad 0
qualities 0
they 0
discover 0
in 0
us.’” 0

How 0
Cor 0
orans 0
will 0
end 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
of 0
Avila’s 0
reform 0
of 0
Carmel 0

Sister 0
T. 0
continued, 0
saying 0
that 0
the 0
document 0
explicitly 0
derogates 0
the 0
founding 0
intentions 0
of 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
for 0
whom 0
real 0
autonomy 0
was 0
a 0
crucial 0
element 0
of 0
her 0
Carmelite 0
reform. 0

She 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
cloistered 0
orders 0
of 0
nuns 0
have 0
for 0
some 0
time 0
been 0
gathered 0
into 0
federations. 0

These 0
are 0
already 0
doing 0
the 0
Cor 0
orans 0
programme, 0
having 0
shared 0
initial 0
formation 0
programmes 0
for 0
postulants 0
and 0
novices, 0
“ongoing 0
formation” 0
courses 0
for 0
professed 0
nuns, 0
a 0
federal 0
abbess 0
or 0
president 0
who 0
oversees 0
all 0
the 0
federated 0
monasteries. 0

Their 0
funds 0
are 0
already 0
interconnected 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
regular 0
meetings 0
with 0
and 0
input 0
from 0
the 0
male 0
branches. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Carmelite 0
monasteries 0
received 0
a 0
questionnaire 0
from 0
the 0
Father 0
General 0
Fr. 0

Saverio 0
Cannistra, 0
a 0
Mexican 0
and 0
devotee 0
of 0
Liberation 0
Theology, 0
to 0
ask 0
if 0
they 0
wanted 0
an 0
International 0
Commission 0
of 0
Nuns 0
to 0
oversee 0
the 0
female 0
houses 0
place 0
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Fathers. 0

This 0
suggestion 0
was 0
rejected, 0
to 0
the 0
annoyance 0
of 0
Maccise. 0

Maccise 0
also 0
promoted 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
having 0
no 0
superiors 0
in 0
the 0
individual 0
monasteries, 0
but 0
only 0
federation 0
presidents 0
and 0
shared 0
formation 0
of 0
novices. 0

The 0
push 0
for 0
these 0
changes 0
is 0
still 0
on, 0
however, 0
under 0
the 0
current 0
General, 0
an 0
Italian, 0
Saverio 0
Cannistrà. 0

Given 0
the 0
Marxist 0
leanings 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
crop 0
of 0
Fathers 0
General, 0
it 0
seems 0
clear 0
that 0
what 0
can 0
be 0
expected 0
by 0
“ongoing 0
formation” 0
is, 0
in 0
essence, 0
some 0
form 0
of 0
political 0
indoctrination, 0
sprayed 0
over 0
with 0
a 0
micro-thin 0
layer 0
of 0
pious 0
language. 0

But 0
for 0
Carmelite 0
nuns, 0
Sister 0
said, 0
these 0
ideas 0
are 0
the 0
antithesis 0
of 0
the 0
intentions 0
of 0
St. 0
Teresa. 0

Authentic 0
autonomy, 0
independence 0
of 0
formation 0
and 0
finances, 0
“are 0
essential 0
points 0
of 0
our 0
charism 0
that 0
Our 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
established 0
and 0
to 0
do 0
away 0
with 0
them 0
is 0
to 0
do 0
away 0
with 0
the 0
charism.” 0

“They 0
go 0
against 0
our 0
Constitutions, 0
even 0
though 0
Cor 0
Orans 0
states 0
that 0
everything 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
done 0
in 0
accord 0
with 0
the 0
charism 0
and 0
Constitutions. 0

Each 0
Carmel 0
has 0
its 0
own 0
spirit, 0
its 0
own 0
tempo, 0
it’s 0
own 0
‘feel.’ 0
Each 0
nun 0
is 0
called 0
not 0
just 0
to 0
the 0
Order, 0
but 0
to 0
a 0
specific 0
Carmel. 0

Formation 0
in 0
common 0
is 0
something 0
we’ve 0
been 0
fighting 0
against 0
for 0
years.” 0

“To 0
have 0
a 0
federal 0
president 0
who 0
can 0
decide 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
novices 0
away, 0
or 0
take 0
all 0
our 0
finances, 0
or 0
tell 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
we’re 0
no 0
longer 0
‘viable’ 0
– 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
disaster. 1

St. 0
Teresa 0
specifically 0
set 0
up 0
the 0
monasteries 0
so 0
that 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
would 0
take 0
place. 0

And 0
now 0
it’s 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
done 0
to 0
us.” 0

She 0
points 0
to 0
the 0
extended 0
length 0
of 0
formation 0
for 0
new 0
nuns 0
- 0
previously 0
six 0
years 0
for 0
Carmelites 0
and 0
under 0
Cor 0
orans 0
now 0
nine 0
years, 0
as 0
absurd, 1
saying 0
it 0
will 0
tend 0
to 0
impede 0
new 0
vocations. 0

“As 0
though 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
ask 0
laypeople 0
to 0
be 0
engaged 0
for 0
nine 0
years 0
before 0
they 0
marry. 0

Our 0
Constitutions 0
already 0
provide 0
a 0
three 0
year 0
extension 0
of 0
temporary 0
vows 0
if 0
needed, 0
but 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
mandatory 0
will 0
dissuade 0
women 0
from 0
entering. 0

It 0
will 0
also 0
help 0
the 0
monastery 0
become 0
‘less 0
viable’ 0
because 0
by 0
the 0
time 0
anyone 0
younger 0
is 0
professed, 0
the 0
others 0
will 0
be 0
dead.” 0

Another 0
requirement 0
will 0
be 0
for 0
a 0
“religious 0
assistant,” 0
a 0
priest 0
monitoring 0
the 0
monastery 0
in 0
addition 0
to 0
a 0
chaplain, 0
to 0
be 0
assigned 0
by 0
the 0
federation. 0

Sister 0
writes 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
rejected 0
“years 0
ago” 0
by 0
Carmelite 0
monasteries 0
as 0
undue 0
interference. 0

The 0
religious 0
assistant 0
will 0
have 0
unprecedented 1
powers. 0

Article 0
23 0
states, 0
for 0
instance, 0
“In 0
discerning 0
the 0
foundation 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
monastery 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
single 0
monastery, 0
the 0
Federal 0
President 0
and 0
the 0
religious 0
assistant 0
intervene 0
to 0
help 0
the 0
superior 0
of 0
the 0

The 0
discernment 0
on 0
the 0

of 0
a 0
new 0
monastery 0
by 0
the 0
Federation 0
is 0
made 0
within 0
the 0
framework 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Assembly.” 0

“One 0
other 0
thing 0
that 0
is 0
very 0
striking 0
to 0
me 0
is 0
the 0
complete 1
loss 1
of 1
our 1
rights. 1

There 0
are 0
no 0
options 0
in 0
this 0
document, 0
no 0
choices, 0
no 0
recourse. 0

It’s 0
all 0
being 0
done 0
to 0
us. 0

In 0
this 0
day 0
and 0
age, 0
when 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
is 0
proclaiming, 0
if 0
not 0
Liberty, 0
Equality, 0
and 0
Fraternity, 0
then 0
at 0
least 0
license 0
and 0
‘choice’ 0
for 0
all, 0
plus 0
the 0
‘rights’ 0
of 0
women, 0
here 0
our 0
rights 0
are 0
completely 0
taken 0
away.” 0

Another 0
nun 0
has 0
written 0
saying 0
that 0
they 0
cannot 0
conceive 0
of 0
what 0
these 0
people 0
mean 0
by 0
“ongoing 0
formation”. 0

Judging 0
from 0
other 0
documents 0
from 0
already-federated 0
Carmelites 0
in 0
Europe, 0
it 0
means 0
in 0
practical 0
terms 0
going 0
in 0
groups 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
monastery 0
for 0
days 0
or 0
weeks 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
to 0
take 0
“courses” 0
together 0
with 0
novices 0
from 0
other 0
monasteries. 0

The 0
content 0
of 0
these 0
course, 0
of 0
course, 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
formulated 0
by 0
teams 0
of 0
“experts” 0
chosen 0
by 0
the 0
Federation. 0

Sister 0
writes, 0
“Cloistered 0
nuns 0
have 0
a 0
very 0
full 0
horarium 0
that 0
does 0
not 0
allow 0
for 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
other 0
things. 0

We 0
already 0
have 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
million 1
unexpected 0
things 0
that 0
come 0
up 0
each 0
day. 0

I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
implement 0
all 0
these 0
ridiculous 1
plans 0
of 0
‘on-going 0
formation’. 0

Can 0
they 0
not 0
comprehend 0
that 0
simply 0
faithfully 0
living 0
our 0
daily 0
life 0
provides 0
plenty 0
of 0
on-going 0
formation.” 0

Apparently 0
not. 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
in 0
my 0
first 0
analysis 0
piece, 0
the 0
document 0
itself 0
– 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
remember 0
is 0
a 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation, 0
a 0
legal 0
document 0
laying 0
out 0
what 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
now 0
do 0
– 0
starts 0
by 0
laying 0
out 0
its 0
working 0
premise: 0

Pope 0
Francis, 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
reaffirmed 0
by 0
Ecumenical 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
II, 0
intended 0
to 0
present 0
in 0
Vultum 0
Dei 0
quaerere 0
the 0
intense 0
and 0
fruitful 0
path 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
decades, 0
in 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Council 0
and 0
considering 0
the 0
changed 0
socio-cultural 0
conditions. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
“intense 1
and 1
fruitful 1
path” 1
of 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
decades 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
since 0
Vatican 0
II 0
that 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
cloistered, 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
now 0
take. 0

Anyone 0
who 0
imagines 0
that 0
this 0
document’s 0
authors 0
will 0
allow 0
leeway, 0
that 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
dispensations 0
forthcoming 0
for 0
traditional 0
or 0
“conservative” 0
communities 0
from 0
timid 0
and 0
cowed 0
Vatican 0
bodies 0
like 0
Ecclesia 0
Dei, 0
has 0
failed 0
to 0
pay 0
attention. 0

In 0
the 0
last 0
20 0
years, 0
“conservative” 0
Catholics 0
have 0
pointed 0
to 0
the 0
flourishing 0
– 0
mainly 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
– 0
of 0
some 0
groups 0
of 0
sisters 0
who 0
had 0
turned 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
“intense 1
and 1
fruitful 1
path” 1
and 0
re-established 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
traditional 0
accoutrements 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
life. 0

They 0
point 0
to 0
the 0
Nashville 0
Dominicans, 0
the 0
Missionaries 0
of 0
Charity, 0
the 0
Poor 0
Clares 0
of 0
Alabama, 0
where 0
there 0
are 0
at 0
least 0
habits, 0
(some) 0
chant, 0
common 0
life 0
and 0
common 0
apostolates. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
these 0
signs 0
of 0
refusal 0
of 0
the 0
programme 0
that 0
have 0
infuriated 0
the 0
despots 1
of 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
who 0
would 1
not 1
rest 1
until 1
every 0
last 0
individual 0
house 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
was 0
co-opted, 0
subverted 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
ideology. 0

The 0
little 0
green 0
shoots 0
of 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
faithful 0
Catholic 0
world 0
so 0
rejoiced 0
to 0
see 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
stamped 0
back 0
into 0
the 1
frost 1
of 1
Vatican 1
II’s 1
perpetual 1
winter. 1

In 0
the 0
continuing 0
analysis 0
that 0
will 0
follow 0
this 0
article, 0
we 0
can 0
see 0
that 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
this 0
document 0
is 0
to 0
fulfill 0
the 0
totalitarian 0
fantasies 0
of 0
the 0
anti-Catholic 0
revolutionaries, 0
now 0
nearing 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
their 0
lives 0
50 0
years 0
after 0
their 0
initial 0
near-triumph. 0

Its 0
intention 0
is 0
mopping 0
up; 0
either 0
to 0
herd 0
the 0
remaining 0
recalcitrants 0
– 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
resisted 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
softened 0
and 0
conciliating 0
degrees 0
typical 0
of 0
“conservatives” 0
– 0
into 0
the 0
full 0
post-conciliar 0
“reform” 0
instituted 0
by 0
the 0
revolutionaries 0
in 0

“Some 0
people 0
have 0
shown 0
up 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
fashion. 0

We 0
used 0
to 0
think 0
that 0
fashion 1
has 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
haircuts, 0
clothes, 0
or 0

the 1

today 1
is 1
to 0

and 0
to 1
shed 1
crocodile 1
tears 1
about 1
their 1
sorrows, 1
their 1
heresy, 1
and 1
their 1
historical 1
lies. 1

This 0
is, 0
indeed, 0
a 0
new 0
fashion. 1

Some 0
esteemed 0
people 0
shed 0
tears 0
about 0
what 1
the 1
Jews 1
call 1
‘the 1
Holocaust.’ 1
[…] 0
“Did 0
the 0
Nazi 0
annihilation 1
– 0
the 0
Holocaust 0
– 0

only 0
the 0

Anybody? 0

The 1
Jews 1
claim 1
that 1
it 1
happened 1
to 1
them 1
alone 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
Jews 1
who 1
died 1
in 1
that 1
Holocaust 1
was 1
six 1
million. 1

What 1
we 1
have 1
here 1
are 1
historical 1
errors. 1

First 0
of 0
all, 0
the 0
figure 0
of 0
six 0
million 0

a 0
historical 1
lie. 1

In 0
addition, 0
claiming 1
that 1
it 1
happened 1
to 1
the 1
Jews 1
alone 1
excludes 1
the 1
non-Jews 1
who 1
were 1
tortured 1
by 1
Hitler. 1

So 0
was 0
it 0
annihilation? 1

Yes, 0
it 0
was. 0

Who 0
did 0
Hitler 0
annihilate? 1

He 0
annihilated 1
a 0
group 0
of 0
races 0
and 0
people, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
were 0
even 0
German. 0

Hitler 0
annihilated 1
400,000 0
Germans 0
who 0
were 0
handicapped 0
or 0
suffered 0
from 0
chronic 0
diseases. 0

Hitler 0
did 0
not 0
annihilate 1
the 0
Jews 0
only. 0

[…] 0
“Hitler 1
was 1
not 1
the 1
first 1
in 1
the 1
West 1
to 1
perpetrate 1
a 1
genocide. 1

Inhuman 1
and 1
criminal 1
annihilation 1
runs 1
in 1
the 1
veins 1
of 1
many 1
in 1
the 1
West. 1

Hitler 0
embodies 0
one 0
type 0
of 0
modern 1
Western 1
annihilation. 1

When 1
the 1
Americans 1
occupied 1
the 1
republics 1
of 1
the 1
Indians, 1
they 1
annihilated 1
millions 1
of 1
human 1
beings. 1

It 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
they 1
annihilated 1
50-100 1
hundred 1
million, 1
but 1
nobody 1
ever 1
mentions 1
this. 1

[…] 0
“Was 0
there 0
annihilation? 1

Yes. 0

Many 0
races 0
were 0
annihilated. 1

The 0
Auschwitz 0
camp, 0
which 0
is 0
in 0
southern 0
Poland, 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
and 0
exceptional 1
camp 0
for 0
detention, 0

and 0
forced 0

Many 0

“The 0
Jews 0

because 0
of 0
their 0

They 0
were 0
not 0
banished 0
for 0

There 0
were 0
Jews 0
in 0
the 0
Islamic 0

caliphates 0
as 0
well, 0
but 0
we 0
never 0
killed 0
them 0
just 0
for 0
being 0
Jews. 0

No, 1
it 1
never 1
happened. 1

Hitler 0
and 0
the 0
Nazi 0
state 0
knew 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
the 0
Jews, 0
and 0
therefore, 0
they 0
began 0
tormenting 1
and 1
persecuting 1
them. 1

[…] 0
“That 0
is 0
when 0
the 0
Final 0
Solution 0
began. 0

The 0
Nazis 0
called 0
it 0
the 0
‘Final 0
Solution’ 0
of 0
the 0
Jews. 0

When 0
we 0
say 0
‘Final 1
Solution,’ 1
we 0
realize 0
that 0
many 1
of 1
the 1
terms 1
used 1
by 1
the 1
Zionist 1
state 1
constitute 1
Nazi 1
terms, 1
ideas, 1
and 1
notions. 1

It 1
is 1
as 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
two 1
faces 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
coin. 1

[…] 0
“Since 1
Germany 1
and 1
Europe 1
did 1
not 1
want 1
the 1
Jews, 1
the 1
Nazis 1
came 1
up 1
with 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
sending 1
the 1
Jews 1
to 1
another 1
country. 1

The 1
Nazis 1
suggested 0
Madagascar, 0
Ecuador, 0
or 0
an 0
Arab 0
country 0
– 0
Syria. 0

But 0
after 0
a 0
while, 0
the 0

discovered 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
groups 0
of 0

a 0
state. 0

On 0
Monday, 0

Inspector 0

Michael 0
Horowitz 0
testified 0
with 0
FBI 0
boss 0
Christopher 0
Wray 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee. 0

In 0
a 0
predictable 0
performance, 0
the 0
duo 0
cited 0
mistakes 0
and 0
raised 0
concerns 0
but 0
solved 0

that 0
found 0

not 0
affect 0

and 0

decisions. 0

On 0
Tuesday 0

performed 0
solo 0
before 0
a 0
joint 0
session 0
of 0
the 0
House 0
Oversight 0
and 0
Judiciary 0
Committees. 0

Oversight 0
chairman 0
Trey 0
Gowdy 0
delivered 0
the 0
opening 0
statement. 0

The 0
attorney 0
general 0
had 0
been 0
accused 0
of 0
“softening 0
or 0
watering 0
down 0
his 0
report,” 0
Gowdy 0
said, 0
“When 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
it 0
was 0
Jim 0
Comey 0
who 0
softened 0
and 0
watered 0
down 0
his 0
press 0
release, 0
announcing 0
no 0
charges 0
against 0
Secretary 0
Clinton. 0

We 0
see 0
Jim 1
Comey 1
and 1
Jim 1
Comey 1
alone 1
deciding 0
which 0
DOJ 0
policies 0
to 0
follow 0
and 0
which 0
to 0
ignore, 0
to 0
decide 0
whether 0
there 0
is 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
each 0
and 0
every 0
element 0
of 0
an 0
offense 0
and 0
we 0
see 0
Jim 1
Comey 1

Jim 1

alone 1
deciding 0
whether 0
to 0
send 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Congress 0
in 0
the 0
throes 0
of 0

In 0
a 0

with 0

said 0
that 0
“prejudging 0

it 0
ends, 0
and 0
prejudging 0
the 0
outcome 0

investigation 0
before 0
it 0
begins” 0
is 0
the 0
“textbook 0
definition 0
of 0
bias.” 0
Democrats 0
echoed 0
the 0
IG 0
report’s 0
conclusion 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
bias. 0

Republicans 0
sought 0
to 0
tie 0
up 0
some 0
loose 0
threads. 0

The 0
IG 0
report 0
confirmed 0
that 0
President 0
Obama 0
communicated 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
on 0
her 0
unsecured 0
email 0
system. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
the 0
president 0
had 0
been 0
one 0
of 0
13 0
who 0
had 0
done 0
so. 0

Rep. 0
Steve 0
King 0
asked 0
about 0
the 0
volume 0
of 0
communications 0
between 0
the 0
president 0
and 0
Clinton. 0

“I’ll 0
have 0
to 0
get 0
back 0
to 0
you 0
on 0
that,” 0
Horowitz 0
said, 0
and 0
the 0
IG 0
was 0
“not 0
sure” 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
communications 0
had 0
involved 0
classified 0
or 0
top 0
secret 0
material. 0

If 0
the 0
IG 0
did 0
know 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
the 0
president’s 0
communications 0
with 0
Clinton, 0
he 0
failed 0
to 0
reveal 0
any 0
details. 0

Horowitz 0
“would 0
have 0
to 0
ask” 0
if 0
his 0
team 0
interviewed 0
any 0
officials 0
at 0
the 0
Obama 0
White 0
House 0
but 0
said 0
“not 0
the 0
president 0
himself.” 0

Rep. 0
King 0
asked 0
Horowitz 0
about 0
his 0
first 0
encounter 0
with 0
the 0
switch 0
of 0
“extremely 1
careless” 1
for 0
‘gross 1
negligence,” 1
which 0
violated 0
a 0
criminal 0
statute. 0

Horowitz 0
found 0
that 0
Peter 0
Strzok, 0
Lisa 0
Page, 0
and 0
James 0
Comey 0
were 0
all 0
involved. 0

The 0
IG 0
also 0
said 0
his 0
team 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
classified 0
material 0
on 0
Clinton’s 0
server 0
was 0
“not 0
clearly 0
marked,” 0
which 0
repeated 0
one 0
of 0
Clinton’s 0
claims 0
about 0
her 0
negligence. 1

As 0
for 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
her 0
“intent,” 0
Horowitz 0
said 0
it 0
arose 0
“months 0
earlier,” 0
maybe 0
in 0
2015, 0
though 0
he 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
sure. 0

King 0
said 0
President 0
Obama 0
had 0
suggested 0
the 0
“careless 0
but 0
not 0
intentional” 0
language 0
in 0
a 0
“60 0
Minutes” 0
appearance 0
in 0
October 0
of 0
2015. 0

And 0
King 0
had 0
observed 0
that 0
in 0
his 0
July 0
5, 0
2016 0
statement, 0
James 0
Comey 0
used 0
“intent” 0
six 0
times. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
Comey 0
“concealed 0
from 0
the 0
attorney 0
general 0
and 0
the 0
deputy 0
attorney 0
general, 0
his 0
intention 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
unilateral 0
announcement 0
in 0
July 0
2016 0
about 0
the 0
reasons 0
for 0
his 0
recommendations 0
not 0
to 0
prosecute 0
former 0
Secretary 0
Clinton.” 0
The 0
IG 0
also 0
described 0
his 0
report 0
as 0
a 0
“thorough, 0
comprehensive 0
and 0
objective 0
recitation 0
of 0
the 0
facts.” 0

The 0
IG 0
did 0
confirm 0
that 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation, 0
the 0
Russia 0
and 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Page 0
had 0
exchanged 0
“tens 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
texts.” 0
Ohio 0
Rep. 0
James 0
Jordan 0
asked 0
Horowitz 0
when 0
his 0
team 0
had 0
discovered 0
the 0
message 0
about 0
“we’ll 0
stop” 0
Trump. 0

Horowitz 0
conceded 0
that 0
this 0
meant 0
“stop 0
Trump 0
from 0
becoming 0
president.” 0
The 0
IG 0
said 0
they 0
uncovered 0
that 0
text 0
in 0
May, 0
and 0
Jordan 0
asked 0
“why 0
did 0
we 0
not 0
see 0
it 0
until 0
last 0
Thursday?” 0

“I 0
can’t 0
answer 0
that,” 0
Horowitz 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
been 0
sent 0
to 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein’s 0
department 0
at 0
the 0
DOJ. 0

Jordan 0
concluded 0
that 0
Rosenstein 0
“made 0
the 0
decision 0
that 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
wait 0
a 0
month.” 0

Several 0
representatives 0
were 0
curious 0
about 0
two 0
FBI 0
agents 0
and 0
one 0
lawyer 0
the 0
IG 0
report 0
had 0
not 0
named. 0

“The 0
FBI 0
raised 0
a 0
concern 0
because 0
they 0
work 0
on 0
counterintelligence 0
matters,” 0
Horowitz 0
said. 0

Rep 0
Mark 0
Meadows 0
asked 0
if 0
the 0
two 0
FBI 0
agents 0
were 0
Kevin 0
Clinesmith 0
and 0
Sally 0
Moyer, 0
which 0
the 0
IG 0
declined 0
to 0
confirm. 0

“They 0
don’t 0
work 0
in 0
counterintelligence,” 0
said 0
Meadows, 0
who 0
charged 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
gave 0
the 0
IG 0
“false 0
information” 0
and 0
altered 0
key 0
witness 0
reports. 0

“How 0
did 0
Comey 0
see 0
the 0
report 0
before 0
it 0
came 0
out?” 0
Rep. 0
Darrell 0
Issa 0
wanted 0
to 0
know. 0

Horowitz 0
said 0
Comey 0
didn’t 0
see 0
the 0
whole 0
thing, 0
but 0
explained 0
that 0
he 0
allowed 0
those 0
the 0
IG 0
team 0
had 0
criticized 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
look 0
before 0
release. 0

By 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
it 0
was 0
evident 0
that 0
Congress 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
hear 0
from 0
Comey, 0
Rosenstein, 0
Strzok 0
and 0
others. 0

Horowitz 0
confirmed 0
that 0
the 0
IG 0
is 0
investigating 0
whether 0
FBI 0
official 0
Peter 0
Strzok’s 0
anti-Trump 0
bias 0
factored 0
into 0
the 0
launch 0
of 0
the 0
bureau’s 0
Russia 0
probe. 0

Also 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
was 0
“escorted” 0
from 0
the 0
FBI 0
building. 0

As 0
his 0
lawyer 0
told 0
reporters, 0
Strzok 0
had 0
“played 0
by 0
the 0
rules,” 0
but 0
been 0
targeted 0
by 0
“unfounded 0
personal 0
attacks, 0
political 0
games 0
and 0
inappropriate 0
information 0
leaks.” 0

“I 0
hope 0
he 0
comes 0
and 0
portrays 0
himself 0
as 0
a 0
victim,” 0
Trey 0
Gowdy 0
told 0
Fox 0
News. 0

Rep. 0
Bob 0
Goodlatte 0
said 0
the 0
committee 0
would 0
issue 0
a 0
subpoena 0
for 0
Strzok 0
to 0
testify 0
“next 0
week.” 0

That 0
will 0
make 0
for 0
an 0
exciting 0
show 0
on 0
C-SPAN 0
but 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
happening 0
if 0
the 0
deep 1
state 1
plot 1
to 0
“stop” 0
Trump 0
had 0
succeeded. 0

Bruce 0
Thornton 0
is 0
a 0
Shillman 0
Journalism 0
Fellow 0
at 0
the 0
David 0
Horowitz 0
Freedom 0
Center. 0

From 0
the 0
playground 0
to 0
geopolitics, 0
appeasing 0
an 0
aggressor 0
invites 0
only 0
more 0
aggression. 0

This 0
timeless 0
truth 0
of 0
human 0
nature 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
we 0
moderns 0
can’t 0
seem 0
to 0
accept. 0

We 0
reflexively 0
assume 0
that 0
a 0
rational 0
accommodation 0
or 0
concessions 0
will 0
be 0
reciprocated 0
by 0
those 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
ready 0
to 0
use 0
any 0
means 0
necessary 0
to 0
achieve 0
their 0
aims, 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
amoral, 1
unfair, 1
or 1
vicious. 1

Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
confirmation 0
hearings 0
for 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
illustrate 0
that 0
this 0
false 0
assumption 0
leads 0
only 0
to 0
more 0
demands, 0
and 0
ultimately 0
to 0
defeat. 0

The 1
last-minute 1
accusations 1
from 1
Christine 1
Blasey 1
Ford, 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
claims 1
that 1
decades 1
ago 1
Kavanaugh 1
groped 1
her 1
at 1
a 1
high 1
school 1
party, 1
and 1
Deborah 1
Ramirez, 1
who 1
accused 1
Kavanaugh 1
of 1
exposing 1
himself 1
to 1
her 1
at 1
a 1
frat 1
party 1
at 1
Yale, 1
are 1
transparent 1
acts 1
of 1
aggression 1
against 1
the 1
judge 1
and 1
Republicans, 1
one 1
engineered 1
by 1
the 1
Democrats. 1

Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
sat 0
for 0
months 0
on 0
Ford’s 0
letter 0
and 0
then––just 0
as 0
the 1
Dems 1
did 0
in 0
1991with 0
Anita 0
Hill’s 0
charges 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
against 0
Clarence 0
Thomas’s 0
during 0
his 0
hearings––released 0
it 0
only 0
when 0
Kavanaugh 0
appeared 0
to 0
be 0
heading 0
for 0
confirmation. 0

Feinstein 0
still 0
hasn’t 0
given 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
an 0
unredacted 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
letter. 0

A 0
few 0
weeks 0
after 0
Ford 0
went 0
public, 0
and 0
after 0
Kavanaugh 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
dairies 0
from 0
that 0
summer 0
detailing 0
his 0
whereabouts, 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
published 0
Ramirez’s 0
account 0
of 0
a 0
drunken 0
party 0
filled 0
with 0
obscene 0
drinking 0
games 0
where 0
he 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
Ramirez. 0

Given 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats 0
had 0
made 0
public 0
in 0
advance 0
their 0
intention 0
to 0
derail 0
the 0
hearings 0
and 0
confirmation 0
by 0
any 0
means 0
possible, 0
the 0
timing 0
of 0
both 0
sexual 0
assault 0
charges 0
reeks 1
of 1
premeditated 0
contrivance 0
intended 0
to 0
delay 0
confirmation 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
possible. 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
this 0
naked 1
ploy 1
to 0
bork 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
derail 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
for 0
partisan 0
advantage, 0
the 0
Republicans 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
reverting 0
to 0
their 0
customary 1
preemptive 1
cringe. 1

All 0
the 1
Dems 1
have 0
to 0
do 0
is 1
squeal 1
“sexism” 0
and 0
Republicans 0
start 0
negotiating 0
and 0
offering 0
concessions. 0

Of 0
course, 0
after 0
each 0
concession 0
comes 0
another 0
demand. 0

First 0
the 1
Dems 1
demanded 0
that 0
Ford, 0
a 0
long-time 0
Democrat 0
activist, 0
“be 0
heard.” 0
So 0
last 0
week 0
the 0
Chairman 0
of 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
Chuck 0
Grassley, 0
granted 0
another 0
deadline 0
extension 0
for 0
Ford 0
to 0
decide 0
whether 0
to 0
testify 0
before 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
Monday. 0

Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
calls 0
these 0
concessions 0
“bullying 1
deadlines.” 1
As 0
Feinstein 0
put 0
it, 0
“Show 0
some 0
heart. 0

Wait 0
until 0
Dr. 0
Ford 0
feels 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
come 0
before 0
the 0
committee.” 0
Ford 0
doesn’t 0
“feel” 0
like 0
she 0
can 0
testify 0
on 0
Monday 0
because 0
she’s 0
afraid 0
of 0
flying, 0
despite 0
offers 0
from 0
the 0
Committee 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
her 0
in 0
California. 0

Then 0
she 0
feared 0
for 0
her 0
life 0
because 0
of 0
death 0
threats 0
––threats 0
also 0
made 0
to 0
Kavanaugh, 0
his 0
wife 0
and 0
two 0
young 0
daughters–– 0
so 0
she 0
now 0
demands 0
enhanced 0
security 0
measures. 0

The 0
Committee 0
caved 0
and 0
moved 0
the 0
date 0
to 0
Thursday. 0

So 0
of 0
course, 0
Grassley 0
having 0
been 0
intimidated 0
into 0
giving 0
Ford 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
address 0
the 0
Committee, 0
Ramirez 0
and 0
her 0
handlers 0
are 0
now 0
demanding 0
the 0
same 0
privilege. 0

“Creepy 1
Lawyer” 1
for 0
porn 0
star 0
Stormy 0
Daniels 0
claims 0
to 0
represent 0
a 0
woman 0
who 0
also 0
should 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
testify 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
Committee 0
about 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
partying 0
habits 0
while 0
at 0
Yale. 0

We’ll 0
have 0
to 0
see 0
whether 0
Grassley 0
can 0
find 1
the 1
stomach 1
to 1
put 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
farce 1
of 0
allowing 0
unsubstantiated 0
charges 0
from 0
Democrat 0
activists 0
to 0
waste 0
the 0
Committee’s 0
time. 0

Ford 0
and 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
also 0
keep 0
demanding 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation, 0
even 0
though 0
no 0
federal 0
crime 0
is 0
being 0
alleged, 0
and 0
any 0
investigation 0
36 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
offense 0
is 0
impossible. 0

Ford 0
can’t 0
remember 0
where 0
and 0
when 0
the 0
alleged 0
assault 0
took 0
place, 0
nor 0
how 0
she 0
got 0
to 0
or 0
went 0
home 0
from 0
the 0
party 0
where 0
it 0
allegedly 0
occurred. 0

Her 1
own 1
details 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
don’t 1
jibe 1
(Four 1
boys 1
or 1
three? 1

One 1
girl 1
or 1
two?). 1

She 0
told 0
no 0
one 0
about 0
the 0
assault 0
until 0
30 0
years 0
later. 0

A 0
“lifelong 0
friend” 0
whom 0
Ford 0
claims 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
has 0
denied 0
any 0
knowledge 0
of 0
the 0
it, 0
and 0
says 0
she’s 0
never 0
met 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Another 0
friend 0
who 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
school 0
was 0
abuzz 0
with 0
gossip 0
about 0
the 0
attack 0
(which 0
apparently 0
took 0
place 0
during 0
summer 0
break), 0
retracted 0
her 0
statement. 0

The 0
two 0
men 0
Ford 0
named 0
as 0
possible 0
witnesses 0
to 0
the 0
assault 0
have 0
contradicter 0
her 0
claims 0
under 0
oath. 0

And 0
the 0
accused 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
also 0
under 0
oath 0
vehemently 1
denies 1
the 0
charges. 0

Given 0
that 0
36 0
years 0
have 0
passed 0
since 0
the 0
incident, 0
and 0
the 0
accuser’s 0
memory 0
is 0
so 0
hazy 0
and 0
short 0
on 0
coherent 0
details, 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
investigate. 0

Ramirez’s 0
charge 0
is 0
even 0
flimsier. 0

Here’s 0
a 0
catalogue 0
from 0
the 0
Daily 0
Wire: 0

1. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
could 0
not 0
find 0
a 0
single 0
witness 0
who 0
could 0
put 0
Kavanaugh 0
at 0
the 0
alleged 0
party. 0

2. 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
could 0
not 0
find 0
a 0
single 0
person 0
who 0
could 0
corroborate 0
Ramirez’s 0
claims. 0

3. 0

The 0
man 0
accused 0
of 0
egging 0
on 0
Kavanaugh 0
denied 0
Ramirez's 0
allegations 0
and 0
vouched 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
character. 0

4. 0

A 0
third 0
person 0
that 0
Ramirez 0
claimed 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
says 0
she 0
was 0
not 0
there 0
for 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident. 0

5. 0

Ramirez 0
contacted 0
her 0
former 0
classmates, 0
asking 0
about 0
the 0
incident, 0
and 0
admitted 0
she 0
was 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
the 0
male 0
who 0
exposed 0
himself. 0

6. 0

A 0
woman 0
who 0
claims 0
she 0
was 0
“best 0
friends” 0
with 0
Ramirez 0
says 0
Ramirez 0
never 0
mentioned 0
the 0
story 0
and 0
initially 0
said 0
her 0
friend's 0
accusations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
might 0
be 0
“politically 0
motivated.” 0

7. 0

Ramirez, 0
just 0
like 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
is 0
a 0
registered 0
Democrat 0
and 0
is 0
dedicated 0
to 0
leftist 0
causes. 0

8. 0

Ramirez 0
wasn’t 0
even 0
sure 0
her 0
memory 0
was 0
correct 0
— 0
until 0
she 0
spent 0
six 0
days 0
going 0
over 0
it 0
with 0
her 1
Democrat 1
lawyer. 1

9. 0

Ramirez 0
admits 0
there 0
are 0
holes 0
in 0
her 0
memory 0
due 0
to 0
how 0
much 0
she 0
drank 0
at 0
the 0
party. 0

10. 0

People 0
who 0
knew 0
Ramirez 0
after 0
her 0
time 0
at 0
Yale 0
say 0
that 0
she 0
never 0
once 0
mentioned 0
the 0
incident 0
— 0
until 0
Kavanaugh's 0
nomination 0
was 0
pending. 0

No 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agency, 0
let 0
alone 0
the 0
FBI, 0
would 0
waste 0
its 0
time 0
with 0
an 0
allegation 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
decades 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
and 0
so 0
patently 0
incoherent 0
and 0
lacking 0
in 0
evidence. 0

The 0
“FBI 0
investigation” 0
is 0
another 0
delaying 0
tactic. 0

Ford 0
has 0
finally 0
agreed 0
to 0
testify, 0
set 0
for 0
Thursday 0
for 0
now. 0

But 0
it’s 0
unclear 0
whether 0
Grassley 0
has 0
granted 0
Ford 0
any 0
of 0
her 0
preposterous 1
conditions 1
for 0
testifying: 0
She 0
will 0
take 0
questions 0
from 0
the 0
Committee, 0
but 0
not 0
from 0
outside 0
lawyers, 0
who 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
as 0
gentle 0
as 0
politicians 1
with 1
one 1
eye 1
on 1
the 1
polls. 1

Only 0
one 0
camera 0
can 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
room. 0

Kavanaugh 0
must 0
testify 0
first, 0
a 1
grotesque 1
inversion 1
of 0
our 1
bedrock 1
principle 1
that 1
an 1
accused 1
has 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
confront 1
his 1
accuser’s 1
charges. 1

He 0
can’t 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
with 0
her, 0
apparently 0
because 0
she’s 0
still 0
traumatized 0
and 0
may 0
start 0
experiencing 0
flashbacks. 0

So 0
much 0
for 0
“I 0
am 1
woman, 1
hear 1
me 1
roar.” 1

Grassley 0
shouldn’t 0
cave 0
on 0
these 0
conditions. 0

They 0
all 0
comprise 0
the 0
old 0
tactic 0
of 0
serially 0
escalating 0
demands 0
that 0
cannot 0
be 0
satisfied 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
compel 0
your 0
enemy 0
to 0
give 0
in. 0

That 0
Grassley 0
and 0
the 0
Republicans 0
would 0
even 0
participate 0
in 0
this 0
absurd 1
show 1
trial 1
is 0
testimony 0
to 0
how 0
deeply 0
the 0
progressive 0
ideological 0
narrative 0
has 0
burrowed 0
into 0
our 0
social 0
and 0
political 0
life. 0

If 0
Ford 0
actually 0
testifies 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
or 0
Ramirez 0
is 0
granted 0
the 0
same 0
concession, 0
nothing 0
material 0
will 0
be 0
gained. 0

Her 0
accusation 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
proved 0
true 0
or 0
false. 0

We 0
will 0
learn 0
nothing 0
about 0
Kavanaugh 0
that 0
makes 0
him 0
any 0
less 0
eminently 0
qualified 0
for 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court, 0
nothing 0
that 0
can 0
add 0
to 0
the 0
thousands 0
of 0
pages 0
of 0
documents 0
already 0
presented 0
to 0
the 0
Committee, 0
or 0
the 0
hundreds 0
of 0
hours 0
of 0
the 0
judge’s 0
testimony 0
before 0
rabid 1
partisans 1
and 1
office-seekers. 1

But 0
vetting 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
qualifications 0
isn’t 0
the 0
point. 0

The 0
point 0
is 0
to 0
delay 0
confirmation 0
by 0
slandering 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
baiting 0
the 0
Republicans 0
into 0
appearing 0
to 0
abuse 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

Why? 0

Facing 0
his 0
likely 0
confirmation, 0
the 1
Dems, 1
egged 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media––especially 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker, 0
which 0
published 0
a 0
story 0
too 0
badly 0
sourced 0
even 0
for 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times–– 0
are 0
desperately 0
attempting 0
to 0
obstruct 0
and 0
delay 0
the 0
process 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections, 0
when 0
they 0
hope 0
they 0
will 0
retake 0
the 0
Senate 0
and 0
thus 0
stop 0
any 0
more 0
Constitutionalist 0
judges 0
from 0
being 0
confirmed 0
to 0
the 0
Court 0
for 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
term. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
have 0
stooped 1
so 1
low 1
with 1
these 1
smears 1
because 0
they 0
know 0
the 0
stakes. 0

The 0
courts 0
and 0
especially 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
have 0
been 0
critical 0
to 0
the 0
progressives’ 0
program 0
since 0
Woodrow 0
Wilson. 0

The 0
biggest 0
obstacle 0
to 0
the 0
progressive 0
dream 0
of 0
government 0
controlled 0
and 0
managed 0
by 0
a 0
technocratic 0
oligarchy 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

Its 0
divided 0
and 0
balanced 0
powers 0
were 0
designed 0
precisely 0
to 0
rein 0
in 0
overreaching 0
ambition 0
and 0
concentrations 0
of 0
power. 0

Hence 0
the 0
Constitutional 0
order 0
must 0
be 0
subverted 0
by 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
and 0
its 0
unaccountable 0
justices 0
enjoying 0
lifelong 0
tenure. 0

But 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
confirmed, 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
five 0
reliably 0
Constitutionalist 0
justices 0
on 0
the 0
bench, 0
who 0
are 0
unlikely 0
to 0
tolerate 0
judicial 0
usurpation 0
of 0
Congress’s 0
law-making 0
powers. 0

That’s 0
why 0
this 0
current 0
nomination 0
is 0
a 0
hill 0
the 1
Dems 1
are 0
willing 0
to 1
beclown 1
themselves 1
on. 1

Given 0
how 0
obviously 1
partisan 1
and 1
hypocritical 1
this 0
ploy 0
is––doesn’t 0
Keith 0
Ellison’s 0
accuser 0
deserve 0
to 0
be 0
heard 0
and 0
believed 0
too? 0

––why 1
has 1
Grassley 1
so 1
far 1
allowed 1
himself 1
to 1
be 1
played 1
by 1
the 1
Dems? 1

Because 0
Republicans 0
fear 0
the 0
backlash 0
from 0
all 0
those 0
women 0
voters 0
who 0
presumably 0
agree 0
with 0
the 0
fundamentalist 0
feminists, 0
and 0
insist 0
that 0
every 1
accusation 1
of 1
sexual 1
assault, 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
much 1
it’s 1
unsupported 1
by 1
corroborating 1
evidence 1
or 1
even 1
plausibility, 1
must 1
be 1
believed. 1

This 0
contention 0
itself 0
is 0
an 0
expression 0
of 0
the 0
radical 0
feminist 0
narrative 0
of 0
innate 0
male 0
feral 1
sexuality 1
that 0
makes 0
them 0
sexual 1
predators. 1

The 0
irony 0
is 0
that 0
today’s 0
feminists 0
have 0
been 0
willing 0
to 0
sacrifice 0
the 0
earlier 0
narrative 0
of 0
female 0
power 0
and 0
agency 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
stifled 0
by 0
traditional 0
views 0
of 0
the 0
sexes 0
and 0
their 0
capabilities. 0

Instead, 0
now 0
women 0
are 0
Victorian 1
hothouse 1
flowers 1
too 0
delicate 0
to 0
make 0
their 0
way 0
through 0
their 0
lives 0
without 0
the 0
paternal 0
federal 0
government 0
protecting 0
them 0
with 0
its 0
coercive 0
power. 0

Women 0
have 0
exchanged 0
one 0
form 0
of 0
dependence, 0
and 0
one 0
double 0
standard 0
for 0
another. 0

The 1
Dems 1
are 0
using 0
Ford 0
and 0
Ramirez 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
transparently 0
dishonest 0
delaying 0
tactics 0
because 0
they 0
know 0
that 0
most 0
Republicans 0
have 0
accepted 0
this 0
duplicitous 0
feminist 0
narrative 0
and 0
fear 0
challenging 0
it. 0

Especially 0
after 0
the 0
recent 0
spate 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault 0
charges––many 0
of 0
them 0
true, 0
some 0
false, 0
others 0
contested–– 0
politicians 0
consider 0
bucking 0
the 0
narrative 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
politically 1
suicidal 1
as 0
proposing 0
to 0
reform 0
Social 0
Security 0
and 0
Medicare. 0

It’s 0
the 0
new 0
third 0
rail 0
of 0
American 0
politics, 0
one 0
that 0
transcends 0
party 0
affiliation. 0

Hence 0
the 0
widespread 0
virtue-signaling 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
even 0
of 0
conservative 0
writers 0
who 0
preface 0
their 0
comments 0
about 0
Ford 0
and 0
Ramirez 0
with 0
prologues 0
full 0
of 0
truisms 0
about 0
how 0
horrible 0
sexual 0
assault 0
is, 0
how 0
its 0
self-proclaimed 0
victims 0
“must 0
be 0
heard,” 0
and 0
how 0
churlish 0
and 0
sexist 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
question 0
the 0
truth 0
of 0
any 0
charge. 0

Grown-ups 0
know 0
all 0
that 0
and 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
reminded 0
every 0
time 0
the 0
subject 0
arises. 0

The 1
Dems 1
know 0
that 0
most 0
Republicans 0
come 0
to 0
this 0
conflict 0
with 0
the 0
huge 0
disadvantage 0
that 0
results 0
from 0
accepting 0
your 0
opponent’s 0
dubious 1
ideology 1
and 1
dishonest 1
narrative. 1

The 0
progressive 0
party 0
can 0
dare 0
the 0
Republicans 0
to 0
ignore 0
the 0
endless 0
specious 0
demands, 0
stop 0
the 0
show-trial, 0
and 0
proceed 0
to 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
Kavanaugh, 0
because 0
they 0
know 0
the 0
Republicans, 0
fearful 0
of 0
the 0
“optics,” 0
will 0
cave. 0

They 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
eleven 0
male 0
Republican 0
Senators 0
on 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
dread 0
the 0
#MeToo 0
movement 0
casting 0
them 0
as 0
knuckle-dragging 1
Neanderthal 1
sexists 1
who 0
want 0
to 0
“silence” 0
the 0
accuser 0
with 0
their 0
“cavalier 1
treatment 1
of 0
a 0
sexual 0
assault 0
survivor,” 0
as 0
one 0
Ford 0
lawyer 0
has 0
said. 0

Republicans 0
still 0
don’t 0
get 0
that 0
no 0
amount 0
of 0
appeasement 0
will 0
stop 0
the 0
left 0
from 0
demonizing 1
them 1
anyway. 0

Just 0
ask 0
Boy 0
Scout 0
Mitt 0
Romney, 0
who 1
was 1
savaged 1
for 0
his 0
innocuous 0
“binders 0
full 0
of 0
women.” 0

And 0
don’t 0
forget, 0
the 0
old 0
sorta, 0
kinda 0
moderate 0
Democrats 0
like 0
Feinstein 0
and 0
Chuck 0
Schumer, 0
who 0
now 0
have 0
joined 0
the 0
crowd 0
of 0
trendoid 1
socialists 1
armed 1
with 1
torches 1
and 1
pitch-forks, 1
will 0
go 0
along 0
because 0
they’re 0
frightened 0
of 0
their 0
party’s 0
increasingly 1
rabid 1
left-wing 1
base. 1

What 0
can 0
we 0
do 0
to 0
end 0
these 0
confirmation 1
circuses? 1

Just 0
stop 0
holding 0
them. 0

There’s 0
nothing 0
in 0
the 0
Constitution 0
that 0
says 0
the 0
Senate’s 0
power 0
to 0
give 0
“advice 0
and 0
consent” 0
to 0
the 0
president 0
regarding 0
his 0
nominee 0
must 0
entail 0
days 0
of 0
televised 0
hearings 0
replete 0
with 0
caterwauling 1
protestors 1
and 1
grandstanding 1
Senators 1
who’ve 0
already 0
made-up 0
their 0
minds. 0

Invite 0
written 0
questions 0
from 0
the 0
Senate, 0
then 0
schedule 0
one 0
day 0
for 0
the 0
nominee 0
to 0
respond. 0

Don’t 0
put 0
it 0
on 0
television, 0
but 0
make 0
public 0
a 0
written 0
transcript. 0

Remove 0
the 0
television 0
cameras, 0
and 0
attention-craving, 1
politically 1
ambitious 1
Senators 1
will 0
be 0
gone 0
like 0
a 0
cool 0
breeze. 0

For 0
now, 0
Grassley 0
needs 0
to 0
end 0
this 0
farce 1
if 0
Ford 0
doesn’t 0
show 0
up 0
on 0
Thursday 0
or 0
continues 0
to 0
negotiate 0
for 0
more 0
delays 0
and 0
concessions. 0

No 0
more 0
concessions. 0

No 0
more 0
delays. 0

No 1
more 1
ceding 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
to 0
Democrat 0
Party 0
lawyers. 0

Don’t 0
give 0
Ramirez 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
day. 0

Hold 0
the 0
vote 0
no 0
later 0
than 0
Thursday, 0
or 0
Friday 0
if 0
Ford 0
does 0
show 0
up. 0

Make 0
Senators 0
go 0
on 0
the 0
record 0
with 0
their 0
votes, 0
and 0
hold 0
them 0
to 0
account 0
in 0
November. 0

Put 0
to 0
the 0
test 0
the 1
Dems’ 1
claims 0
that 0
a 0
critical 0
mass 0
of 0
women, 0
many 0
of 0
them 0
with 0
sons 0
they 0
don’t 0
want 0
falsely 0
accused, 0
believes 0
the 0
fundamentalist 0
feminist 0
narrative 0
and 0
will 0
vote 0
accordingly. 0

To 0
borrow 0
Churchill’s 0
definition 0
of 0
appeasement, 0
stop 1
feeding 1
the 1
alligator 1
in 1
the 1
hopes 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
eaten 1
last. 1

For 0
fifty 0
years 0
the 0
Democrats 0
have 0
proven 0
they 1
will 1
demonize 1
conservatives 0
as 0
racist 0
and 0
sexist 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
often 0
they 0
bow 0
and 0
scrape. 0

How 0
about 0
acting 0
on 0
principle 0
for 0
a 0
change 0
and 0
shoot 1
the 1
alligator. 1

SPECIAL 0
REPORT: 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
Accused 0
of 0
Inaction 0
in 0
Notorious 0
Sex 0
Abuse 0
Cases 0

The 0
incident 0
was 0
brief: 0
on 0
the 0
Thursday 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
week-long 0
South 0
American 0
trip, 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
an 0
impromptu 0
question 0
tossed 1
out 1
by 0
a 0
Chilean 0
reporter, 0
the 0
pope 0
responded 0
in 0
what 0
one 0
reporter 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“snippy 1
tone”: 1
“The 0
day 0
I 0
see 0
proof 0
against 0
Bishop 0
Barros, 0
then 0
I 0
will 0
talk. 0

There 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
single 0
piece 0
of 0
evidence 0
against 0
him. 0

It 0
is 0
all 0
calumny. 0

Is 0
that 0
clear?” 0

This 0
month 0
has 0
been 0
quite 0
a 0
spectacle, 0
even 0
for 0
this 0
pontificate; 0
an 0
apparently 0
unending 1
stream 1
of 1
outrages 1
and 1
embarrassments, 1
with 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
his 0
Vatican 0
media 0
support 0
jumping 0
from 0
one 0
scandal 0
to 0
the 0
next. 0

But 0
among 0
secular 0
reporters 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
issue 0
trumps 0
all 0
others 0
and 0
the 0
fallout 0
continues 0
to 1
blaze 1
down 1
on 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
pontificate 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
his 0
amazing 0
accusation 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
that 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
were 0
engaging 0
in 0
“calumny,” 0
in 0
their 0
accusations 0
against 0
a 0
Chilean 0
bishop, 0
Juan 0
de 0
la 0
Cruz 0
Barros 0
Madrid. 0

It 0
seems 0
the 0
shine 0
is 0
coming 0
off 0
the 0
papal 0
penny 0
among 0
leftist 1
secular 1
journalists, 1
his 0
natural 0
constituency. 0

Writing 0
for 0
the 0
Boston 0
Globe, 0
the 0
paper 0
that 0
first 0
broke 0
the 0
clerical 0
sex 0
abuse 0
scandals 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
back 0
in 0
2001, 0
Kevin 0
Cullen 0
wrote, 0
“Let 0
the 0
record 0
show 0
that 0
the 0
promise 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
died 0
in 0
Santiago, 0
Chile, 0
on 0
Jan. 0
18, 0
in 0
the 0
year 0
of 0
our 0
Lord 0
2018… 0
he 0
has 0
revealed 0
himself 0
like 0
no 0
one 0
else 0
could.” 0

But 0
it 0
gets 0
worse 0
than 0
this. 0

When 0
a 1
“leftist” 1
pope 1
pressing 0
a 0
secularist 0
agenda 0
on 0
the 0
Church 0
starts 0
to 0
lose 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
Michael 0
Sean 0
Winters 0
and 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter, 0
he 0
must 0
know 0
he’s 0
in 0
trouble. 0

Though 0
he’s 0
“sticking 0
with 0
Francis” 0
for 0
now, 0
Winters 0
wrote, 0
“I 0
wish 0
I 0
knew 0
what 0
it 0
was 0
about 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
that 0
makes 0
him 0
fail 0
to 0
grasp 0
the 0
situation 0
with 0
Bishop 0
Barros, 0
the 0
pain 0
caused 0
to 0
the 0
victims 0
and 0
the 0
damage 0
done 0
to 0
the 0
church. 0

I 0
am 0
gobsmacked 1
that 0
the 0
pope 0
twice 0
declined 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
bishop’s 0
resignation.” 0

On 0
January 0
23rd, 0
an 0
unsigned 0
NCR 0
editorial 0
opined, 0
“Within 0
the 0
space 0
of 0
four 0
days, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
twice 0
slandered 0
abuse 0
survivors.” 0

“These 0
remarks 0
are 0
at 0
the 0
least 0
shameful. 0

At 0
the 0
most, 0
they 0
suggest 0
that 0
Francis 0
now 0
could 0
be 0
complicit 0
in 0
the 0
cover-up. 0

The 0
script 0
is 0
all 0
too 0
familiar: 0
Discredit 0
the 0
survivors’ 0
testimony, 0
support 0
the 0
prelate 0
in 0
question, 0
and 0
bank 0
on 0
public 0
attention 0
moving 0
on 0
to 0
something 0
else. 0

“The 0
insistence 0
with 0
which 0
Francis 0
defends 0
Barros 0
is 0
mystifying. 0

Three 0
separate 0
journalists 0
on 0
the 0
papal 0
flight 0
gave 0
the 0
pope 0
opportunity 0
to 0
say 0
why 0
exactly 0
he 0
believed 0
the 0
bishop 0
instead 0
of 0
the 0
survivors 0
accusing 0
him. 0

The 0
second 0
journalist 0
to 0
ask 0
Francis 0
about 0
Barros 0
on 0
the 0
flight 0
was 0
a 0
Chilean 0
woman. 0

As 0
she 0
spoke 0
to 0
the 0
pope, 0
her 1
voice 1
cracked 1
with 1
nervousness 1
at 0
questioning 0
the 0
church’s 0
top 0
leader. 0

She 0
asked: 0
‘Why 0
are 0
not 0
the 0
victims’ 0
testimonies 0
proof 0
for 0
you? 0

Why 0
do 0
you 0
not 0
believe 0
them?’ 0
The 0
pope 0
gave 0
no 0
satisfying 0
answer, 0
only 0
repeating 0
a 0
claim 0
of 0
‘no 0
evidence’ 0
against 0
the 0
bishop.” 0

Indeed, 0
it 0
was 0
understood, 0
as 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
said, 0
that 0
Francis’ 0
trip 0
to 0
Latin 0
America 0
– 0
dogged 0
by 0
protests 0
over 0
Barros 0
both 0
in 0
person 0
at 0
the 0
pope’s 0
appearances 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
– 0
was 0
in 0
part 0
intended 0
as 0
“an 0
apology 0
tour” 0
to 0
abuse 0
survivors. 0

Which 0
is 0
why 0
his 0
accusation 0
of 0
calumny 0
against 0
those 0
same 0
victims 0
the 0
next 0
day 0
came 0
as 0
such 0
a 0
shock 0
to 0
observers 0
unused 0
to 0
Bergoglio’s 0
ability 0
to 0
turn 0
on 0
a 0
dime. 0

All 0
was 0
going 0
as 0
planned. 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
January 0
17, 0
the 0
pope 0
met 0
as 0
scheduled 0
with 0
selected 0
survivors 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
priests. 0

He 0
made 0
all 0
the 0
right 0
noises, 0
talking 0
about 0
his 0
“pain 0
and 0
shame,” 0
and 0
reportedly 0
even 0
crying, 0
at 0
what 0
happened. 0

“I 0
know 0
the 0
pain 0
of 0
these 0
cases 0
of 0
child 0
abuse 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
following 0
how 0
much 0
is 0
needed 0
to 0
overcome 0
this 0
serious 1
and 1
painful 1
evil,” 1
he 0
said. 0

24 0
hours 0
later 0
he 0
was 0
calling 0
them 0
liars. 0

James 0
Hamilton, 0
49 0
and 0
now 0
a 0
doctor, 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
Barros 0
accusers. 0

He 0
told 0
the 0
BBC 0
at 0
a 0
press 0
conference, 0
“What 0
the 0
Pope 0
has 0
done 0
today 0
is 0
offensive 0
and 0
painful, 0
and 0
not 0
only 0
against 0
us, 0
but 0
against 0
everyone 0
seeking 0
to 0
end 0
the 0
abuses.” 0
The 0
lead 0
voice 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
in 0
Chile, 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
tweeting 0
to 0
one 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
leading 0
apologists, 0
Austen 0
Ivereigh, 0
said, 0
“Does 0
he 0
need 0
a 0
photo, 0
a 0
selfie, 0
as 0
proof? 0

Sorry 0
Austen, 0
we 0
didn’t 0
think 0
of 0
it 0
as 0
we 0
were 0
being 0
abused 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
watching.” 0

Although 0
the 0
issue 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
a 0
much 0
broader 0
audience 0
during 0
the 0
most 0
recent 0
papal 0
trip, 0
the 0
outcry 0
has 0
been 0
ongoing 0
since 0
his 0
appointment 0
to 0
the 0
southern 0
Chilean 0
diocese 0
of 0
Osorno 0
in 0
2015. 0

Barros 0
was 0
a 0
student 0
protégée 0
of 0
the 1
charismatic 1
homosexual/pederast 1
predator 1
Fernando 1
Karadima, 1
and 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
be 0
ordained 0
in 0
1984, 0
made 0
bishop 0
in 0
1995 0
and 0
appointed 0
as 0
bishop 0
of 0
the 0
armed 0
forces. 0

Barros 0
claimed 0
in 0
court 0
that 0
the 0
first 0
he 0
knew 0
of 0
Karadima’s 0
offenses 0
was 0
on 0
a 0
Chilean 0
television 0
programme 0
in 0
2010. 0

This 0
is 0
refuted 0
by 0
Karadima’s 0
victims 0
– 0
deemed 0
credible 0
both 0
by 0
the 0
secular 0
courts 0
and 0
the 0
Vatican 0
tribunal 0
– 0
who 0
testified 0
that 0
he 0
personally 0
witnessed 0
the 0
abuse 0
at 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
of 0
Jesus 0
church 0
in 0
Santiago. 0

Last 0
Thursday, 0
however, 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
Francis, 0
confronted 0
unexpectedly 0
in 0
public 0
over 0
the 0
Barros 0
question, 0
has 0
responded 0
testily 0
and 0
with 0
insults. 0

In 0
2015 0
the 0
Italian 0
newspaper 0
Il 0
Fatto 0
Quotidiano 0
published 0
a 0
video 0
of 0
him 0
scolding 0
two 0
women 0
who 0
spoke 0
with 0
him 0
in 0
St. 0
Peter’s 0
Piazza, 0
asking 0
that 0
he 0
reconsider 0
the 0
appointment, 0
citing 0
the 0
“suffering” 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Chile 0
over 0
the 0
issue. 0

The 0
pope 0
told 0
the 0
women, 0
“The 0
Church 0
has 0
lost 0
its 0
freedom, 0
letting 0
its 0
head 0
fill 0
with 0
politicians 0
and 0
accusing 0
a 0
bishop 0
without 0
having 0
any 0
proof, 0
after 0
twenty 0
years 0
of 0
service, 0
so 0
think 1
with 1
your 1
head.” 1
He 0
warned 0
them 0
not 0
to 0
allow 0
themselves 0
to 0
be 0
led 0
by 0
“leftists 1
who 1
have 1
set 1
up 1
this 1
thing.” 1

“The 0
only 0
charge 0
against 0
this 0
bishop 0
has 0
been 0
discredited 0
by 0
the 0
Court 0
of 0
Justice, 0
so 0
please 0
do 0
not 0
lose 0
your 0
serenity, 0
you 0
suffer, 0
but 0
because 0
you 1
are 1
foolish...I 1
am 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
judge 0
and 0
punish 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
similar 0
crimes, 0
but 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
even 0
a 0
proof.” 0

The 0
insults 0
were 0
not 0
forgotten. 0

Among 0
the 0
signs 0
held 0
by 0
protesters 0
in 0
Chile 0
last 0
week 0
were 0
those 0
reading, 0
“Ni 0
zurdos, 0
ni 0
tontos,” 0
(Neither 1
lefties 1
nor 1
stupid). 1

The 0
jab 0
certainly 0
wasn’t 0
lost 0
on 0
Francis, 0
since 0
the 0
signs 0
were 0
being 0
held 0
by 0
protesters 0
the 0
full 0
length 0
of 0
his 0
auto 0
route 0
to 0
Santiago 0
from 0
the 0
airport. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
protesters 0
told 0
the 0
BBC, 0
“He 0
doesn’t 0
even 0
know 0
us, 0
so 0
how 0
can 0
he 0
accuse 0
us 0
of 0
being 0
such 0
things? 0

He 0
thinks 0
we 0
are 0
politically 0
motivated 0
even 0
though 0
we 0
come 0
from 0
different 0
parishes 0
in 0
Osorno 0
and 0
are 0
doing 0
this 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
against 0
priests 0
being 0
allowed 0
to 0
abuse 0
children.” 0

Apparently 0
His 0
Holiness 0
was 0
informed 0
that 0
the 0
“calumny” 1
comment 1
had 0
caused 0
some 0
blow-back 0
because 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
days 0
later 0
we 0
got 0
something 0
touted 0
– 0
though 0
somewhat 0
skeptically 0
– 0
as 0
a 0
“contrite” 0
papal 0
apology. 0

This 0
also 0
followed 0
an 0
astonishing 0
public 0
rebuke 0
of 0
the 0
pope 0
by 0
Sean 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
– 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
C9 0
council 0
of 0
cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission 0
– 0
who 0
said, 0
“It 0
is 0
understandable 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
statements 0
yesterday 0
in 0
Santiago, 0
Chile 0
were 0
a 0
source 0
of 0
great 0
pain 0
for 0
survivors 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
or 0
any 0
other 0
perpetrator.” 0

“Pope 0
Francis 0
fully 0
recognizes 0
the 1
egregious 1
failures 1
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
its 0
clergy 0
who 0
abused 0
children 0
and 0
the 0
devastating 1
impact 1
those 0
crimes 0
have 0
had 0
on 0
survivors 0
and 0
their 0
loved 0
ones,” 0
O’Malley 0
said. 0

Of 0
course, 0
Francis 0
being 0
Francis 0
the 0
apology 0
was 0
banked 0
around 0
with 0
assertions 0
of 0
how 0
right 0
he 0
was. 0

“I 0
have 0
to 0
ask 0
forgiveness 0
because 0
the 0
word 0
‘proof’ 0
wounded,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“It 0
wounded 0
many 0
people 0
who 0
were 0
abused…I 0
ask 0
them 0
for 0
forgiveness 0
because 0
I 0
wounded 0
them 0
without 0
realizing 0
it, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
unintended 0
wound. 0

And 0
this 1
horrified 1
me 1
a 1
lot, 1
because 0
I 0
had 0
received 0
them.” 0

“And 0
I 0
know 0
how 0
much 0
they 0
suffer, 0
to 0
feel 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
says 0
in 0
their 0
face 0
‘bring 0
me 0
a 0
letter, 0
a 0
proof.’ 0
It’s 0
a 0
slap. 0

And 0
I 0
agree 0
that 0
my 0
expression 0
was 0
not 0
apt, 0
because 0
I 0
didn’t 0
think.” 0

He 0
doubled 0
down, 0
saying, 0
“I 0
have 0
not 0
heard 0
any 0
victim 0
of 0
Barros. 0

They 0
did 0
not 0
come, 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
themselves, 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
give 0
evidence 0
in 0
court. 0

It’s 1
all 1
in 1
the 1
air. 1

It 0
is 0
true 0
that 0
Barros 0
was 0
in 0
Karadima’s 0
group 0
of 0
young 0
people. 0

But 0
let 0
us 0
be 0
clear: 0
if 0
you 0
accuse 0
someone 0
without 0
evidence 0
with 0
pertinacity, 0
that 0
is 0
calumny.” 0

“This 0
is 0
what 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
with 0
sincerity. 0

Barros 0
will 0
remain 0
there 0
if 0
I 0
don’t 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
condemn 0
him. 0

I 0
cannot 0
condemn 0
him 0
if 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
– 0
I 0
don’t 0
say 0
proof 0
– 0
but 0
evidence. 0

And 0
there 0
are 0
many 0
ways 0
to 0
get 0
evidence. 0

Is 0
that 0
clear?” 0

This 0
“contrite” 0
papal 0
apology 0
didn’t 0
fly 0
well 0
even 0
with 0
the 0
regular 0
news 0
reporters. 0

Philip 0
Pullela, 0
a 0
reporter 0
on 0
the 0
plane 0
for 0
Reuters, 0
described 0
it 0
as 0
“an 0
extremely 0
rare 0
act 0
of 0
self-criticism,” 0
for 0
the 0
“unusually 1
contrite” 1
Bergoglio, 0
and 0
noted 0
that, 0
“While 0
the 0
pope 0
has 0
vowed 0
‘zero 0
tolerance’ 0
for 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
his 0
efforts 0
have 0
sputtered.” 0

Indeed, 0
Francis 0
claim 0
that 0
he 0
met 0
with 0
and 0
heard 0
the 0
“pain” 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
is 0
untrue 0
in 0
the 0
specific 0
case 0
in 0
hand. 0

CBS 0
News 0
reports 0
that 0
though 0
the 0
Osorno 0
group 0
had 0
tried 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
meeting 0
during 0
the 0
trip 0
they 0
were 0
refused. 0

Greg 0
Burke, 0
the 0
pope’s 0
press 0
officer, 0
confirmed 0
that 0
“no 0
papal 0
meetings 0
were 0
planned 0
with 0
the 0
Osorno 0
group, 0
which 0
had 0
formally 0
requested 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
in 0
July 0
but 0
were 0
told 0
by 0
Vatican 0
organizers 0
that 0
his 0
schedule 0
was 0
already 0
final, 0
some 0
six 0
months 0
before 0
the 0
trip.” 0

Who 0
is 0
Barros? 0

Some 0
may 0
remember 0
a 0
video 0
that 0
made 0
the 0
internet 0
rounds 0
of 0
an 0
uproar 0
in 0
a 0
Chilean 0
cathedral 0
at 0
the 0
installation 0
ceremony 0
of 0
a 0
bishop. 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
it 0
didn’t 0
draw 0
much 0
attention 0
from 0
the 0
English 0
language 0
press 0
– 0
mostly 0
at 0
that 0
time 0
distracted 0
by 0
the 0
ongoing 0
battle 0
of 0
the 0
notorious 0
Kasper 0
Proposal 0
and 0
the 0
oncoming 0
Synods. 0

But 0
despite 0
the 0
pope’s 0
claim, 0
the 0
charges 0
against 0
Barros 0
are 0
serious 0
and 0
have 0
been 0
deemed 0
credible 0
by 0
a 0
judge. 0

He 0
is 0
accused 0
of 0
having 0
covered 0
up 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
including 0
destroying 0
evidence, 0
committed 0
by 0
Karadima 0
in 0
the 0
‘80s 0
and 0
‘90s. 0

In 0
fact 0
– 0
and 0
this 0
point 0
has 0
tended 0
to 0
get 0
glossed 0
over 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
– 0
Barros 0
is 0
accused 0
by 0
the 0
victims 0
of 0
having 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
room, 0
watching 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
and 0
of 0
engaging 0
in 0
sexual 0
activity 0
with 0
Karadima. 0

This 0
is 0
not, 0
therefore, 0
merely 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
a 0
bishop 0
or 0
colleague 0
discovering 0
the 0
abuse 0
after 0
the 0
fact, 0
but 0
of 0
being 0
a 1
voyeuristic 1
participant. 1

Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
told 0
the 0
press 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
another 0
boy 0
– 0
both 0
in 0
their 0
teens 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
– 0
“would 0
lie 0
down 0
on 0
the 0
priest’s 0
[Karadima’s] 0
bed, 0
one 0
resting 0
his 0
head 0
at 0
the 0
man’s 0
shoulder, 0
another 0
sitting 0
near 0
his 0

“Barros 0
was 0
there, 0
and 0
he 0
saw 0
it 0
all.” 0

A 0

investigation 0
found 0
Karadima 0
guilty 0
in 0
2011 0
and 0
sentenced 0
him 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
seclusion 0
in 0
a 0
monastery 0
for 0
“penitence 0
and 0
prayer.” 0
Note 0
that 0
date; 0
2011 0
was 0
when 0
the 0
processes 0
for 0
investigating 0
and 0
trying 0
priest-abusers, 1
put 0
in 0
place 0
by 0
the 0
former 0
Cardinal 0

still 0
in 0
effect, 0
and 0
while 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
Petrine 0
throne. 0

Things 0
are 0
a 0
bit 0
different 0
now. 0

Neither 0
was 0
the 0
complaint 0
against 0
Barros 0
without 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
responsible 0
people. 0

The 0
media 0
reported 0
that 0
over 0
1,300 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
in 0
Osorno, 0
including 0
30 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
and 0
51 0
members 0
of 0
Parliament, 0
wrote 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
asking 0
him 0
to 0
rescind 0
the 0
appointment 0
– 0
none 0
of 0
which 0
received 0
any 0
response. 0

Fr. 0

Peter 0
Kleigel, 0
a 0
priest 0
of 0
Osorno, 0
told 0
Associated 0
Press, 0
“We’re 0
convinced 0
that 0
this 0
appointment 0
is 0
not 0
correct 0
because, 0
following 0
canon 0
law, 0
a 0
bishop 0
must 0
be 0
well-regarded. 0

We 0
need 0
a 0
bishop 0
who’s 0
credible.” 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
getting 0
the 0
news 0
out 0
about 0
Karadima, 0
as 0
in 0
most 0
of 0
these 0
cases, 0
was 0
the 0
bishop, 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
Cardinal 0
Francisco 0
Javier 0
Errázuriz 0
of 0
Santiago, 0
who 0
after 0
the 0
Conclave 0
of 0
2013 0
was 0
appointed 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
C9 0
inner 0
council. 0

It 0
was 0
certainly 0
never 0
a 0
secret 0
that 0
Errázuriz 0
was 0
a 0
close, 0
like-minded 0
friend 0
and 0
collaborator 0
of 0
then-Cardinal 0
Bergoglio, 0
the 1
kingpin 1
of 1
South 1
American 1
Catholicism. 1

Allegations 0
against 0
Karadima 0
– 0
that 0
went 0
back 0
to 0
1962 0
– 0
had 0
certainly 0
been 0
reported 0
to 0
Church 0
authorities 0
well 0
before 0
a 0
Chilean 0
news 0
agency 0
revealed 0
the 0
case 0
in 0
2010, 0
but 0
were 0
ignored 0
by 0
Errázuriz. 0

Even 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter 0
in 0
2014 0
pointed 0
to 0
the 0
cover 0
up 0
and 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
the 0
new 0
pope 0
and 0
the 0
accused 0
cardinals, 0

“Hamilton 0
had 0
applied 0
for 0
a 0
marriage 0
annulment, 0
after 0
telling 0
his 0
wife 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
psychosexual 0
entanglement 0
with 0
Karadima 0
that 0
began 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
17 0
in 0
El 0
Bosque. 0

His 0
wife 0
confided 0
in 0
a 0
priest, 0
who 0
told 0
Errázuriz 0
in 0
2006. 0

When 0
a 0
canon 0
lawyer 0
and 0
several 0
priests 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
cardinal 0
suggested 0
that 0
Hamilton 0
not 0
mention 0
Karadima, 0
he 0
pressed 0
on 0
with 0
his 0
request 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
force 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
punishment 0
for 0
the 0
priest 0
while 0
having 0
his 0
marriage 0
annulled. 0

Again, 0
Errázuriz 0
refused 0
to 0
take 0
action 0
against 0
Karadima.” 0

The 0
pope’s 0
claim 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
flies 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
ruling 0
of 0
the 0
civil 0
judge 0
in 0
the 0
Karadima 0
case 0
– 0
a 0
fact 0
that 0
ought 0
to 0
be 0
of 0
paramount 0
consideration 0
under 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
own 0
rules 0
for 0
determining 0
credibility 0
in 0
such 0
cases. 0

While 0
Judge 0
Jessica 0
Gonzalez 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
drop 0
criminal 0
charges 0
because 0
the 0
statute 0
of 0
limitations 0
had 0
expired, 0
she 0
affirmed 0
that 0
testimony 0
by 0
Cruz 0
and 0
other 0
victims 0
was 0
credible. 0

After 0
a 0
full 0
year 0
of 0
investigation, 0
Gonzalez 0
called 0
their 0
claims 0
“truthful 0
and 0
reliable”. 0

Victims 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
letter 0
written 0
to 0
Church 0
authorities 0
complaining 0
of 0
Karadima’s 0
abuse 0
in 0
1982 0
was 0
intercepted 0
and 0
destroyed 0
by 0
Barros, 0
who 0
was 0
serving 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
as 0
secretary 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Francisco 0
Fresno, 0
Errázuriz’s 0
successor 0
and 0
collaborator. 0

As 0
for 0
Barros’s 0
general 0
credibility 0
as 0
a 0
Catholic 0
bishop, 0
the 0
witness 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
is 0
damning. 0

In 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Bishop 0
Ivo 0
Scapolo, 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
to 0
Chile, 0
that 0
Cruz 0
gave 0
to 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
witnessed 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Barros 0
in 0
an 0
intimate 0
relationship. 0

“I 0
saw 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
kissing 0
and 0
touching 0
each 0
other. 0

The 0
groping 0
generally 0
came 0
from 0
Karadima 0
touching 0
Barros’ 0
genitals”. 0

Barros 0
has 0
never 0
denied 0
having 0
had 0
a 0
close 0
friendship 0
with 0
Karadima. 0

Hamilton 0
confirmed 0
this 0
saying, 0
“I 0
saw 0
how 0
Barros 0
watched 0
it 0
all.” 0

And 0
the 0
matter 0
didn’t 0
end 0
in 0
2010. 0

Emails 0
published 0
in 0
Chile 0
in 0
2015 0
showed 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Errázuriz 0
also 0
blocked 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz 0
from 0
the 0
new 0
child 0
protection 0
commission 0
– 0
a 0
group 0
plagued 1
by 0
such 0
scandals 0
and 0
eventually 0
ignored 1
to 1
death 1
by 0
Francis. 0

Which 0
brings 0
us 0
to 0
Francis 0
Bergoglio’s 0
own 0
record 0
in 0
this 0
area. 0

The 0
pope 0
claimed 0
“I 0
am 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
judge 0
and 0
punish 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
similar 0
crimes,” 0
but 0
this 0
claim 0
is 0
not 0
supported 0
by 0
the 0
reality. 0

Indeed, 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
Francis 0
has 0
gone 0
to 0
considerable 0
lengths 0
to 0
dismantle 0
the 0
efforts 0
of 0
his 0
predecessor 0
at 0
“safeguarding” 0
young 0
people, 0
punishing 0
abusers 0
and 0
removing 0
bishops 0
who 0
cover 0
it 0
up. 0

In 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Barros, 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
obtained 0
a 0
confidential 0
letter 0
from 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
dated 0
2015 0
that 0
“reveals 0
the 0
[Chilean] 0
bishops’ 0
concern 0
about 0
Francis 0
naming 0
a 0
Karadima 0
protégé, 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros.” 0
Just 0
days 0
before 0
the 0
pope’s 0
“calumny” 0
comment, 0
January 0
11, 0
AP 0
reported 0
that 0
Francis 0
had 0
full 0
knowledge 0
of 0
the 0
controversy 0
he 0
risked 0
in 0
appointing 0
Barros 0
to 0
Osorno. 0

“[H]is 0
ambassador 0
in 0
Chile 0
had 0
tried 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
contain 0
the 0
damage 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
case 0
made 0
headlines.” 0

The 0
letter, 0
addressed 0
to 0
the 0
executive 0
committee 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishops’ 0
conference, 0
said, 0
“Thank 0
you 0
for 0
having 0
openly 0
demonstrated 0
the 0
concern 0
that 0
you 0
have 0
about 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
Monsignor 0
Juan 0
Barros. 0

I 0
understand 0
what 0
you’re 0
telling 0
me 0
and 0
I’m 0
aware 0
that 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
the 0
church 0
in 0
Chile 0
is 0
difficult 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
trials 0
you’ve 0
had 0
to 0
undergo.” 0
The 0
letter 0
said 0
that 0
in 0
2014 0
the 0
nuncio, 0
Archbishop 0
Scapolo, 0
had 0
asked 0
Barros 0
to 0
resign 0
as 0
bishop 0
of 0
the 0
armed 0
forces 0
and 0
had 0
“encouraged 0
him 0
to 0
take 0
a 0
sabbatical 0
year 0
before 0
assuming 0
any 0
other 0
pastoral 0
responsibility 0
as 0
a 0
bishop.” 0

There 0
can 0
also 0
be 0
little 0
doubt 0
the 0
new 0
pope 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
record 0
of 0
his 0
close 0
friend 0
Cardinal 0
Errázuriz 0
in 0
ignoring 0
complaints 0
of 0
Karadima’s 0
victims 0
when 0
he 0
appointed 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
C9 0
council. 0

And 0
even 0
if 0
he 0
didn’t 0
then, 0
he 0
certainly 0
knows 0
now, 0
and 0
yet 0
Errazuriz 0
continues 0
in 0
that 0
advisory 0
role. 0

Francis 0
further 0
appointed 0
Cardinal 0
Errázuriz 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
his 0
Special 0
Envoy 0
to 0
World 0
Apostolic 0
Congress 0
Of 0
Mercy 0
III 0
meeting 0
in 0
Bogotá, 0
Colombia 0
in 0
June 0
2014. 0

Since 0
2001, 0
Cardinal 0
Ratzinger 0
and 0
later 0
as 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
installed 0
effective 0
procedural 0
reforms 0
on 0
clerical 0
sexual 0
abuse; 0
Francis 0
in 0
his 0
short 0
five 0
years 0
has 0
all 0
but 0
completely 0
dismantled 0
or 0
reversed 0
those 0
changes. 0

Among 0
the 0
earliest 0
indications 0
Catholics 0
had 0
that 0
the 0
new 0
pope 0
had 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
getting 0
to 0
the 0
bottom 0
of 0
the 0
priest-abuser 0
problem 0
was 0
his 0
appointment 0
of 0
the 1
notorious 1
homosexual, 1
Monsignor 0
Battista 0
Ricca, 0
as 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Bank 0
and 0
the 0
man 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
residence, 0
the 0
Casa 0
Santa 0
Martha. 0

It 0
is 0
often 0
forgotten 0
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
notorious 0
comment 0
“who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge” 1
was 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
on 0
a 0
plane-presser 0
about 0
Ricca, 0
and 0
was 0
followed 0
with 0
a 0
similar 0
claim 0
from 0
Francis 0
about 0
there 0
having 0
been 0
no 0
proof 0
of 0
his 0
misbehaviour. 0

As 0
the 0
pseudonymous 0
Marcantonio 0
Colonna 0
wrote 0
in 0
the 0
book, 0
“The 0
Dictator 0
Pope,” 0
“In 0
fact 0
his 0
patronage 0
of 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca 0
fits 0
the 0
pattern 0
which 0
was 0
well 0
established 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
whereby 0
he 0
surrounds 0
himself 0
with 0
morally 0
weak 0
people 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
under 1
his 1
thumb.” 1

But 0
even 0
before 0
this 0
was 0
the 1
sinister 1
appearance 1
of 0
Godfried 0
Cardinal 0
Danneels 0
on 0
the 0
loggia 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
election 0
to 0
the 0
papacy. 0

Danneels’s 0
prominence 0
in 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
pontificate 0
continues 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
most 0
prominent 0
indicator 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
deprioritising 0
of 0
clerical 0
sexual 0
abuse. 0

The 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Brussels 0
archdiocese 0
was 0
a 0
leading 0
figure 0
in 0
the 0
so-called 0
St. 0
Gallen 0
Group, 0
which 0
he 0
himself 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“mafia,” 1
who 0
had 0
worked 0
against 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
in 0
2005 0
and 0
to 0
elect 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
2013. 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
career 0
as 0
Europe’s 0
leading 0
“liberal” 0
Catholic 0
prelate, 0
Danneels 0
came 0
under 0
a 0
cloud 0
of 0
scandal 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
having 0
covered 0
for 0
a 0
protégé 0
bishop 0
who 0
admitted 0
to 0
having 0
sexually 0
abused 0
his 0
own 0
minor 0
nephew. 0

In 0
2010 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
an 0
audio 0
recording 0
determined 0
undeniably 0
that 0
Danneels 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
victim 0
to 0
keep 0
quiet 0
and 0
not 0
cause 0
trouble 0
for 0
the 0
soon-to-retire 0
Bishop 0
Roger 0
Vangheluwe 0
of 0
Bruges. 0

The 0
cardinal 0
even 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
suggest 0
that 0
the 0
victim 0
should 0
“ask 0
forgiveness” 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
scandal. 0

Before 0
the 0
recordings 0
were 0
released, 0
Danneels 0
had 0
also 0
denied 0
all 0
knowledge 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
or 0
cover-ups. 0

In 0
the 0
book, 0
Colonna 0
asks 0
the 0
question, 0
“What 1
happened 1
to 1
‘Zero 1
Tolerance’ 1
for 1
clerical 1
sexual 1
offenders?” 1
He 0
wrote 0
that 0
data 0
presented 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
the 0
UN 0
Human 0
Rights 0
Commission 0
in 0
January 0
2014 0
showed 0
that 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
“had 0
defrocked 0
or 0
suspended 0
more 0
than 0
800 0
priests 0
for 0
past 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
between 0
2009 0
and 0
2012,” 0
including 0
the 0
notorious 0
Fr. 0

Maciel 0
Degollado, 0
founder 0
of 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ. 0

Crucially, 0
it 0
was 0
Ratzinger 0
who 0
moved 0
the 0
competence 0
for 0
sex 0
abuse 0
cases 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
to 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
with 0
powers 0
to 0
suspend 0
and 0
punish 0
offenders. 0

His 0
reforms 0
specifically 0
included 0
bishops 0
who 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
act 0
against 0
priest-abusers. 0

A 0
senior 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
diplomatic 0
corps, 0
Archbishop 0
Miguel 0
Maury 0
Buendia, 0
confirmed 0
this, 0
saying, 0
“This 0
Pope 0
has 0
removed 0
two 0
or 0
three 0
bishops 0
per 0
month 0
throughout 0
the 0
world... 0

There 0
have 0
been 0
two 0
or 0
three 0
instances 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
said 0
no, 0
and 0
so 0
the 0
Pope 0
simply 0
removed 0
them.” 0

These 0
reforms 0
– 0
and 0
removals 0
– 0
have 0
ceased 0
entirely 0
under 0
Francis. 0

Despite 0
his 0
claims 0
that 0
he 0
punishes 0
the 0
guilty, 0
it 0
was 0
in 0
fact 0
Francis 0
who 0
reversed 0
the 0
previous, 0
Benedict-era 0
sentence 0
against 0
the 1
notorious 1
Italian 1
priest-pederast 1
Mario 0
Inzoli 0
at 0
the 0
request 0
of 0
the 0
now-equally 0
notorious 0
Cardinal 0
Coccopalmerio. 0

Inzoli 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
in 0
2012 0
by 0
an 0
ecclesiastical 0
court 0
of 0
abusing 0
boys 0
as 0
young 0
as 0
twelve 0
and 0
suspended. 0

Inzoli 0
had 0
even 0
abused 0
boys 0
in 0
the 0
confessional, 0
convincing 0
them 0
that 0
the 1
abuse 1
was 1
approved 1
by 1
God. 1

Following 0
an 0
appeal 0
by 0
Coccopalmerio, 0
Francis 0
reduced 0
the 0
priest’s 0
penalty 0
to 0
a 0
“lifetime 0
of 0
prayer,” 0
with 0
permission 0
to 0
say 0
Mass 0
privately, 0
and 0
a 0
promise 0
to 0
stay 0
away 0
from 0
children. 0

The 0
uproar 0
over 0
this 0
caused 0
the 0
Italian 0
prosecutors 0
to 0
reopen 0
the 0
case 0
against 0
the 0
priest, 0
and 0
eventually 0
Inzoli 0
went 0
to 0
prison 0
and 0
was 0
laicized. 0

As 0
for 0
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0
procedural 0
reforms, 0
rumours 0
continue 0
to 0
circulate 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
intends 0
to 0
reverse 0
them 0
as 0
well, 0
placing 0
competence 0
back 0
into 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
dicastery 0
that 0
held 0
it 0
when 0
the 0
scandals 0
broke 0
in 0
2001. 0

This 0
has 0
been 0
denied 0
by 0
Greg 0
Burke, 0
but 0
given 1
Francis’s 1
usual 1
methods, 1
it’s 1
anyone’s 1
guess 1
who 1
in 1
reality 1
is 1
actually 1
dealing 1
with 1
these 1
cases, 1
if 1
anyone. 1

A 0
tribunal 0
of 0
bishops, 0
requested 0
by 0
his 0
own 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
was 0
ignored 0
and 0
then 0
Francis 0
summarily 0
removed 0
two 0
of 0
the 0
CDF 0
staffers 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
handling 0
such 0
cases, 0
famously 0
refusing 0
to 0
give 0
any 0
reasons 0
to 0
CDF 0
prefect 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
who 0
was 0
soon 0
to 0
be 0
dismissed. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
chaos 0
and 0
lack 0
of 0
commitment 0
on 0
the 0
issue 0
has 0
come 0
under 0
harsh 1
criticism 1
from 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
now-defunct 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission, 0
a 1
loudly 1
trumpeted 1
part 1
of 0
Bergoglio’s 0
early 0
scheme 0
of 0
reform. 0

Marie 0
Collins, 0
an 0
Irish 0
abuse 0
survivor, 0
was 0
appointed 0
in 0
2014 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Pontifical 0
Commission 0
for 0
the 0
Protection 0
of 0
Minors. 0

She 0
resigned 0
in 0
2017, 0
citing 0
“Vatican 0
officials’ 0
reluctance 0
to 0
cooperate 0
with 0
its 0
work 0
to 0
protect 0
children.” 0
Collins 0
released 0
a 0
damning 0
statement, 0
indicating 0
that 0
the 0
commission 0
had 0
never 0
seriously 0
intended 0
to 0
change 0
or 0
reform 0
anything. 0

She 0
said 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
commission’s 0
recommendations 0
had 0
been 0
implemented. 0

“The 1
reluctance 1
of 1
some 1
in 1
the 1
Vatican 1
Curia 1
to 1
implement 1
recommendations 1
or 1
cooperate 1
with 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
a 1
commission 1
when 1
the 1
purpose 1
is 1
to 1
improve 1
the 1
safety 1
of 1
children 1
and 1
vulnerable 1
adults 1
around 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
unacceptable,” 1
Collins 0
wrote. 0

As 0
of 0
December 0
last 0
year, 0
the 0
commission 0
has 0
been 0
allowed 0
to 0
lapse, 0
and 0
no 0
longer 0
functions, 0
though 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
definitively 0
dissolved. 0

The 0
terms 0
of 0
office 0
of 0
its 0

This 0
week 0
Collins 0
tweeted 0
her 0
question 0
for 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
the 0
Chilean 0
situation: 0
“Why 0
does 0
the 0
Pope 0
not 0
believe 0
these 0
three 0
men? 0

They 0
have 0
been 0
consistent 0
over 0
years 0
in 0
what 0
they 0
say. 0

When 0
asked 0
why 0
he 0
believes 0
his 0
fellow 0
cleric 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
survivors 0
he 0
can 0
give 0
no 0

to 0

clergy 0

throughout 0
her 0

was 0
commenting 0
on 0
the 0
latest 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
case 0
to 0
touch 0
the 0
Francis 0
papacy, 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
where 0
the 0
Pope 0
appointed 0
a 0
bishop 0
with 0
a 0
history 0
of 0
complicity 0
in 0
child 0
sex 0
abuse. 0

The 0
Pope’s 0
claim 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
never 0
received 0
any 0
victim 0
testimony 0
regarding 0
the 0
complicity 0
of 0
Chilean 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
in 0
child 0
sex 0
abuse 0
has 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
false. 0

“The 0
Barros 0
case 0
is 0
putting 0
the 0
Pope, 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time, 0
in 0
the 0
middle 0
as 0
a 0
principal 1
in 1
a 1
cover-up,” 1
Yore 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
interview. 0

Yore 0
said 0
that 0
not 0
only 0
is 0
it 0
now 0
known 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
received 0
a 0
letter 0
from 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
victims, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
now 0
known 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
“told 0
from 0
the 0
moment 0
he 0
appointed 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
bad 0
decision.” 0

“The 0
Chilean 0
Archbishop 0
conference 0
told 0
him 0
to 0
revoke 0
this 0
appointment. 0

He 0
received 0
petitions 0
and 0
letters 0

calls, 0
yet, 0
ignored 0
them 0
all,” 0
she 0
said. 0

As 0
details 0
continue 0
to 0
surface, 0
the 0
pontiff’s 0
professed 0
empathy 0
for 0
abuse 0
victims 0
has 0
come 0
into 0
question 0
as 0
well. 0

Yore 0
called 0
the 0
child 0
sex 0
abuse 0
case 0
involving 0
infamous 1
Chilean 1
priest 1
abuser 1
Father 0
Fernando 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
“a 0
scandal 1
of 1
epic 1
proportions.” 1

The 0
scandal 0
signals 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
under 0
Francis 0
is 0
slipping 0
backwards 0
in 0
its 0
handling 0
of 0
abuse, 0
said 0
Yore. 0

Yore 0
called 0
the 0
example 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
set 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
he 0
handled 0
the 0
abuse 0
information 0
“extremely 0
dangerous.” 0

“But 0
it 0
is 0
extremely 1
dangerous 1
as 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
— 0
you 0
know, 0
the 0
last 0
appeal 0
— 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
behavior 0
that 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
mimicked 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
by 0
bishops, 0
[who 0
will 0
say] 0
‘Well 1
if 1
the 1
Pope 1
is 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
intervene 1
and 1
impose 1
zero 1
tolerance, 1
why 1
should 1
I?’” 0

Reports 0
say 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
personally 0
received 0
the 0
eight-page 0
letter 0
from 0
the 0
Chilean 0
victim 0
graphically 0
detailing 0
the 0
alleged 0
abuses 0
by 0
Karadima 0
and 0
linking 0
Barros 0
as 0
having 0
witnessed 0
and 0
covered 0
up 0
the 0
abuse. 0

The 0
alleged 0
abuse 0
took 0
place 0
decades 0
prior 0
to 0
Francis’s 0
2015 0
appointment 0
of 0
Barros 0
to 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Osorno 0
in 0
southern 0
Chile. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
received 0
the 0
victim’s 0
letter 0
in 0
2015, 0
its 0
author 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
sex 0
abuse 0
commission 0
have 0
said, 0
contradicting 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
recent 0
insistence 0
that 0
no 0
victims 0
had 0
come 0
forward 0
in 0
the 0
matter 0
and 0
no 0
evidence 0
had 0
been 0
produced. 0

Francis 0
encountered 0
protests 0
in 0
Chile 0
over 0
his 0
defense 0
of 0
Barros 0
during 0
his 0
visit 0
there 0
last 0
month, 0
calling 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
the 0
priest 0
“calumny.” 1

While 0
Francis 0
later 0
apologized, 0
he 0
persisted 0
in 0
defending 0
Barros, 0
denying 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
received 0
any 0
testimony 0
himself 0
and 0
restating 0
that 0
such 0
unproven 0
accusations 0
are 0
“slander.” 1

The 0
Pope 0
later 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
send 0
Malta 0
Archbishop 0
Charles 0
Scicluna 0
– 0
the 0
former 0
top 0
Vatican 0
abuse 0
investigator 0
- 0
to 0
Chile 0
to 0
investigate 0
the 0
matter. 0

Expectations 0
were 0
high 0
in 0
2014 0
when 0
the 0
Pope 0
created 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission. 0

And 0
while 0
he 0
has 0
continually 0
condemned 0
clergy 0
sex 0
abuse 0
throughout 0
his 0
pontificate, 0
some 0
have 0
argued 0
his 0
actions 0
in 0
some 0
serious 0
cases 0
don’t 0
match 0
his 0
tough 0
stances 0
on 0
abuse. 0

Four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
had 0
met 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
in 0
2015, 0
conveying 0
their 0
objections 0
to 0
Francis’s 0
2015 0
appointment 0
of 0
Barros 0
as 0
bishop 0
of 0
Osorno. 0

It 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
meeting 0
with 0
O’Malley 0
that 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission 0
representatives 0
reportedly 0
gave 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
cardinal 0
to 0
deliver 0
to 0
Francis, 0
and 0
O’Malley 0
later 0
confirmed 0
to 0
a 0
commission 0
member 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
in 0
fact 0
personally 0
delivered 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
Pope. 0

Yore 0
explained 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
has 0
been 0
told 0
from 0
the 0
moment 0
he 0
appointed 0
Barros 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
bad 0
decision, 0
between 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishops’ 0
conference, 0
petitions, 0
letters 0
and 0
calls, 0
that 0
were 0
all 0
ignored. 0

Further, 0
a 0
Chilean 0
judicial 0
inquiry 0
found 0
all 0
the 0
victims 0
who 0
testified 0
— 0
including 0
the 0
letter’s 0
author 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
— 0
to 0
be 0
credible, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
cover-up 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
by 0
Father 0
Karadima. 0

Arroyo 0
spoke 0
with 0
Cruz 0
as 0
well, 0
who 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
“incredibly 1
frustrated” 1
when 0
Barros 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
appointed. 0

He’d 0
testified 0
about 0
three 0
bishops 0
who 0
had 0
witnessed 0
abuse, 0
he 0
said, 0
but 0
Barros 0
had 0
special 0
significance 0
for 0
him 0
because 0
Barros’ 0
part 0
went 0
beyond 0
witnessing 0
the 0
abuse, 0
to 0
violating 1
his 1
seal 1
of 1
Confession 1
with 1
Karadima 1
and 0
psychological 0
abuse 0
through 0
intimidation. 0

Cruz 0
recounted 0
how 0
he 0
and 0
other 0
victims 0
had 0
been 0
dismissed 0
or 0
slandered 0
by 0
local 0
Church 0
hierarchy 0
for 0
numerous 0
attempts 0
to 0
be 0
heard. 0

And 0
he 0
spoke 0
about 0
holding 0
out 0
hope 0
that 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
different 0
response 0
from 0
the 0
Pope, 0
discussing 0
specifics 0
of 0
getting 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
Francis 0
via 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley. 0

Cruz 0
told 0
Arroyo 0
he 0
was 0
really 0
hurt 0
and 0
felt 0
betrayed 0
by 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
comments 0
that 0
the 0
accusations 0
were 0
slander, 0
and 0
there 0
were 0
no 0
witnesses 0
or 0
evidence. 0

“To 0
hear 0
him 0
talk 0
about 0
us 0
that 0
way,” 0
Cruz 0
said, 0
“calling 0
us 0
slanderers, 0
it 0
was 0
terrible 0
because 0
it 0
set 0
the 0
clock 0
back 0
for 0
so 0
many 0
victims.” 0

Scicluna 0
will 0
be 0
meeting 0
with 0
Cruz, 0
who 0
said 0
he 0
hopes 0
other 0
abuse 0
survivors 0
will 0
be 0
heard 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
his 0
case 0
coming 0
more 0
to 0
the 0
forefront. 0

“This 0
leaves 0
us 0
with 0
very 0
strong 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
was, 0
in 0
fact, 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
has 0
happened,” 0
Yore 0
said. 0

“Here 0
we 0
have 0
victims 0
10, 0
15 0
years 0
after 0
their 0
abuse, 0
begging 1
the 1
Pope, 1
having 0
to 0
take 0
pictures 0
of 0
a 0
letter 0
that’s 0
handed 0
to 0
a 0
cardinal 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
is 0
receiving 0
this 0
information.” 0

The 1
whole 1
of 1
Latin 1
America, 1
including 1
Argentina, 1
was 1
well 1
aware 1
of 1
what 1
was 1
happening 1
when 0
this 0
case 0
broke 0
in 0
Chile 0
in 0
2010, 0
Yore 0
noted, 0
and 0
yet 0
the 0
Pope 0
continues 0
to 0
shrug 0
his 0
shoulders 0
and 0
say 0
he 0
has 0
no 0
information. 0

This 0
was 0
precisely 0
what 0
he’d 0
been 0
saying 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
cardinal 0
and 0
archbishop 0
in 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
she 0
said, 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
ever 0
came 0
forward 0
with 0
information, 0
and 0
there 1
were 1
never 1
any 1
cases 1
of 1
clerical 1
abuse 1
in 1
the 1
entirety 1
of 1
the 1
two-million-plus 1
member 1
Archdiocese 1
of 1
Buenos 1
Aires. 1

“This 0
isn’t 0
just 0
simply 0
a 0
cover-up 0
of 0
a 0
predator 1
priest,” 1
Yore 0
stated. 0

“This 0
is 0
Barros 0
present, 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
when 0
the 0
abuse 0
is 0
ongoing 0
with 0
these 0
young 0
minor 0
boys.” 0

She 0
said 0
she 0
would 0
argue 0
as 0
a 0
child 0
advocate 0
that 0
Barros 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
of 0
children. 0

“So 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
simply 0
just 0
a 0
case, 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
it 0
is, 0
of 0
a 0
cover-up 0
of 0
an 0
abuser,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“This 0
is 0
also 0
sexual 0
exploitation 0
of 0
children 0
in 0
a 1
grooming 1
gang, 1
a 1
predator 1
priest. 1

This 0
is 0
why 0
it 0
is 0
so 0
heinous.” 1

Yore 0
said 0
that 0
given 0
the 0
Church’s 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis, 0
one 0
would 0
have 0
thought 0
going 0
into 0
the 0
2013 0
conclave 0
(which 0
elected 0
Francis) 0
that 0
an 0
obvious 0
priority 0
in 0
vetting 0
candidates 0
for 0
the 0
papacy 0
would 0
have 0
meant 0
a 0
serious 0
look 0
at 0
their 0
history 0
of 0
handling 0
abuse 0
allegations 0
in 0
their 0
previous 0
sees. 0

There 0
are 0
more 0
cases 0
out 0
there 0
just 0
like 0
Barros 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
covered 0
up, 0
Yore 0
told 0
Arroyo, 0
maybe 0
even 0
some 0
even 0
worse 0
than 0
the 0
Barros 0
case. 0

“Those 0
cases 0
are 0
going 0
to 1
be 1
haunting 1
this 1
papacy 1
and 0
really 0
causing 0
a 0
rift 0
in 0
the 0
major 0
protection 0
of 0
children 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
worked 0
very 0
hard 0
to 0
really 0
build 0
up,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“Trust 0
within 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
a 0
system 0
that 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
root 0
out 0
the 0
predators. 0

And 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
has 0
just 0
been 0
blown 0
up 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
we 0
are 0
back 0
to 0
square 0
one 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican." 0

Trump 0
Vows 0
to 0
Kick 0
CNN’s 0
Acosta 0
Out 0
Again 0

President 0
Trump 0
took 0
CNN’s 0
improbable 0
court 0
victory 0
temporarily 0
restoring 0
CNN 0
White 0
House 0
correspondent 0
Jim 0
Acosta’s 0
“hard 0
pass” 0
media 0
credential 0
for 0
the 0
executive 0
mansion 0
in 0
stride, 0
vowing 0
to 0
kick 0
Acosta 0
out 0
again 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
if 0
he 0
breaches 0
White 0
House 0
protocol 0
again. 0

The 0
yanking 0
of 0
the 0
physical 0
credential, 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
isn’t 0
exactly 0
a 0
grave 1
hardship. 1

It 0
just 0
means 0
Acosta 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
an 0
appointment 0
through 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
office 0
every 0
time 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
grounds, 0
just 0
as 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
non-hard 0
pass-holding 0
journalists 0
who 0
don’t 0
work 0
for 0
big 0
media 0
outlets 0
like 0
CNN 0
have 0
to 0
do. 0

Lacking 0
a 0
hard 0
pass 0
does 0
not 0
prevent 0
anyone 0
from 0
reporting 0
on 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Speaking 0
to 0
Chris 0
Wallace 0
of 0
Fox 0
News 0
Channel 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Sunday, 0
Trump 0
had 0
some 0
new 0
ideas 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
Acosta, 0
who 0
picks 0
fights 0
with 0
him 0
during 0
pressers. 0

"I 0
think 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
we’ll 0
do 0
is 0
maybe 0
turn 0
the 0
camera 0
off 0
that 0
faces 0
them, 0
because 0
then 0
they 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
air 0
time, 0
although 0
I’ll 0
probably 0
be 0
sued 0
for 0
that 0
and 0
maybe, 0
you 0
know, 0
win 0
or 0
lose 0
it, 0
who 0
knows," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"I 0
mean, 0
with 0
this 0
stuff 0
you 0
never 0
know 0
what’s 0
going 0
to 0
happen." 0

The 0
president 0
described 0
Acosta 0
as 0
"unbelievably 1
rude 1
to 0
[White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary] 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee, 0
who’s 0
a 0
wonderful 1
woman," 1
and 0
said 0
his 0
administration 0
is 0
drawing 0
up 0
"rules 0
and 0
regulations" 0
for 0
White 0
House 0
reporters. 0

"And 0
if 1
he 1
misbehaves, 1
we’ll 1
throw 1
him 1
out 1
or 1
we’ll 1
stop 1
the 1
news 1
conference," 1
Trump 0
said. 0

Acosta’s 0
hard 0
pass 0
was 0
pulled 0
after 0
a 0
contentious 0
Nov. 0
7 0
press 0
conference 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

After 0
interacting 0
with 0
President 0
Trump 0
– 0
Acosta 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
“challenge” 0
him 0
on 0
calling 0
the 0
Central 0
American 0
caravans 0
an 0
“invasion” 1
– 0
the 0
president 0
called 0
upon 0
another 0
reporter 0
to 0
speak. 0

After 0
lecturing 0
Trump, 0
Acosta 0
belligerently 1
refused 0
to 0
yield 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
staffer 0
and 0
pushed 0
her 0
arm 0
away 0
as 0
she 0
reached 0
for 0
the 0
device, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
was 0
captured 0
on 0
video. 0

On 0
Nov. 0
16, 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Judge 0
Timothy 0
J. 0
Kelly 0
of 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
by 0
Trump, 0
ruled 0
against 0
the 0
administration 0
and 0
ordered 0
Acosta’s 0
hard 0
pass 0
restored 0
for 0
14 0
days, 0
pending 0
further 0
hearings 0
in 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

But 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
vindication 0
of 0
Acosta’s 0
free 0
speech 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

The 0
judge 0
specifically 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
claim 0
made 0
by 0
Acosta 0
and 0
CNN 0
had 0
not 0
yet 0
been 0
adjudicated 0
and 0
added 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
free 0
not 0
to 0
call 0
on 0
Acosta 0
at 0
future 0
press 0
conferences. 0

The 0
temporary 0
restraining 0
order 0
was 0
nowhere 0
to 0
be 0
found 0
online 0
at 0
press 0
time, 0
but 0
according 0
to 0
media 0
reports, 0
Kelly 0
found 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
violated 0
Acosta’s 0
due 0
process 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
to 0
the 0
Constitution. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
vowed 0
to 0
remedy 0
the 0
situation 0
by 0
drawing 0
up 0
rules 0
governing 0
press 0
conferences. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
said 0
the 0
court 0
ruling 0
was 0
disappointing. 1

“The 0
President 0
has 0
broad 0
authority 0
to 0
regulate 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House, 0
including 0
to 0
ensure 0
fair 0
and 0
orderly 0
White 0
House 0
events 0
and 0
press 0
conferences. 0

We 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
continuing 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
lawful 1
actions." 0

Acosta 0
ignorantly 1
blathered 1
on 0
to 0
reporters 0
when 0
he 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Friday 0
after 0
the 0
court 0
ruling, 0
incorrectly 0
claiming 0
he 0
won 0
a 1
great 1
First 1
Amendment 1
victory. 1

"I'm 0
very 0
grateful 0
for 0
what 0
happened 0
today," 0
Acosta 0
said. 0

"I'm 0
grateful 0
for 0
my 0
colleagues 0
in 0
the 0
press 0
who 0
stood 0
by 0
us 0
through 0
all 0
of 0
this." 0

"This 0
was 0
a 0
test 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
we 0
passed 0
the 0
test," 0
he 0
said. 0

"Journalists 0
need 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
their 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
of 0
freedom 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
are 0
sacred, 0
they're 0
protected 0
in 0
our 1
Constitution," 1
Acosta 0
said. 0

"Throughout 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
I 0
was 0
confident 0
and 0
I 0
thought 0
that 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
result 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
that 0
our 0
rights 0
would 0
be 0
protected 0
as 0
we 0
continue 0
to 0
cover 0
our 0
government 0
and 0
hold 0
our 0
leaders 0
accountable." 0

The 0
court 0
case 0
isn’t 0
over 0
yet. 0

The 0
legal 0
antagonists 0
have 0
to 0
report 0
to 0
the 0
court 0
Monday 0
afternoon. 0

The 0
court 0
ordered 0
the 0
parties 0
to 0
“file 0
a 0
joint 0
status 0
report 0
proposing 0
how 0
they 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
proceed 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
by 0
3:00 0
p.m. 0
on 0
November 0
19, 0
2018[,]” 0
according 0
to 0
its 0
online 0
docket. 0

According 0
to 0
CNN, 0
“White 0
House 0
officials 0
sent 0
Acosta 0
a 0
letter 0
stating 0
that 0
his 0
pass 0
is 0
set 0
to 0
be 0
suspended 0
again 0
once 0

restraining 0
order 0
expires.” 0

From 0
the 0
looks 0
of 0
the 0
letter, 0
the 0
W.H. 0

is 0
trying 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
paper 0
trail 0
that 0
will 0
empower 0
the 0
administration 0
to 0
boot 0
Acosta 0
again 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
month. 0

CNN 0
responded 0
with 0
this 0
statement 0
on 0
Sunday: 0
"The 0
White 0
House 0
is 0
continuing 0
to 0
violate 0
the 0
First 0

5th 0
Amendments 0

the 0
Constitution. 0

These 0
actions 0
threaten 0
all 0

The 0

Ted 0

of 0
the 0

(The 0

sweeping 0
order 0
this 0

from 0

more 0
than 0
18-month-old 0

the 0
Left’s 0

Russia 0
may 0
shed 0
light 0
on 0
what 0
really 0
happened 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election. 0

In 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
Hill.TV 0
yesterday, 0
the 0
president 0
said 0
he 0
ordered 0
the 0
mass 0
declassification 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
public 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
theory 0
began 0
as 1
a 1
“hoax.” 1
Exposing 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
“crowning 1
achievements” 1
of 1
his 1
presidency, 1
he 0
said. 0

“What 1
we’ve 1
done 1
is 1
a 1
great 1
service 1
to 1
the 1
country, 1
really,” 1
he 0
said. 0

“I 0
hope 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
call 0
this, 0
along 0
with 0
tax 0
cuts 0
and 0
regulation 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
things 0
I’ve 0
done… 0
in 0
its 0
own 0
way 0
this 1
might 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
thing 1
because 0
this 0
was 0
corrupt.” 0

Trump 0
criticized 0
how 0
the 0
FBI 0
handled 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe, 0
accusing 0
it 0
of 0
misleading 0
the 0
Foreign 0
Intelligence 0
Surveillance 0
Act 0
(FISA) 0
court, 0
and 0
of 0
spying 0
on 0
his 0
campaign. 0

“They 0
know 0
this 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
scandals 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
our 1
country 1
because 0
basically 0
what 0
they 0
did 0
is, 0
they 0
used 0
[former 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
aide] 0
Carter 0
Page, 0
who 1
nobody 1
even 1
knew, 1
who 0
I 0
feel 0
very 0
badly 0
for, 0
I 0
think 0
he’s 0
been 0
treated 0
very 0
badly. 0

They 0
used 1
Carter 1
Page 1
as 1
a 1
foil 1
in 0
order 0
to 0
surveil 0
a 0
candidate 0
for 0
the 0
presidency 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0

“It’s 1
a 1
hoax, 1
beyond 1
a 1
witch 1
hunt,” 1
Trump 0
said. 0

The 0
documents 0
affected 0
involve 0
a 0
FISA 0
warrant 0
against 0
Carter 0
Page 0
and 0
text 0
messages 0
from 0
disgraced 1
ex-FBI 1
employees 1
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Page. 0

(Carter 0
Page 0
is 0
not 0
related 0
to 0
Lisa 0
Page.) 0

Although 1
the 1
conspiracy 1
theory 1
is 1
baseless 1
nonsense, 1
it 1
continues 1
to 1
dog 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration, 1
providing 0
cable 0
television 0
news 0
outlets 0
and 0
late-night 0
talk 0
show 0
hosts 0
with 0
endless 1
fodder 1
in 0
the 0
24-hour 0
news 0
cycle. 0

When 0
Trump 1
defenders 1
have 0
fought 0
back, 0
social 0
media 0
companies 0
have 0
colluded 0
with 0
the 0
Left 0
to 0
silence 0
and 0
intimidate 0
them. 0

This 0
declassification 0
effort 0
won’t 0
make 0
things 0
any 0
worse 0
than 0
they 0
are 0
for 0
President 0
Trump. 0

It 0
may 0
even 0
prove 1
a 1
political 1
masterstroke 1
of 0
sorts 0
for 0
Trump. 0

How 0
else 0
does 0
one 0
fight 0
back 0
against 0
the 0
nameless, 1
faceless 1
bureaucrats 1
of 1
the 1
Deep 1
State 1
who 0
hide 0
behind 0
anonymity 0
to 0
undermine 0
the 1
duly 1
elected 1
45th 1
president 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States? 1

Make 0
the 0
documents 0
public 0
and 1
let 1
the 1
chips 1
fall 1
where 1
they 1
may. 1

There 0
is 0
so 1
much 1
leftist 1
dirt 1
to 0
uncover. 0

For 0
example, 0
it 0
was 0
established 0
some 0
time 0
ago 0
that 0
former 0
President 0
Obama 0
was 0
involved 0
on 0
some 0
level 0
in 0
this 0
shameful 1
un-American 1
plot 1
to 0
rig 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
and 0
undermine 0
his 0
successor 0
by 0
using 0
the 0
privacy-invading 0
apparatus 0
of 0
the 0
state. 0

Our 0
New 0

As 0
expected, 0
two 0
Muslim 0
women, 0
Rashida 0
Tlaib 0
in 0
Michigan 0
and 0
Ilhan 0
Omar 0
in 0
Minnesota, 0
have 1
been 1
overwhelmingly 1
elected 1
to 0
Congress. 0

The 0
establishment 0
media 0
will 0
celebrate 0
these 0
victories 0
as 0
triumphs 1
of 1
America’s 1
“diversity”; 1
unfortunately, 1
in 1
reality 1
neither 1
one 1
is 1
worth 1
celebrating. 1

Tlaib 0
is 0
a 0
vociferous 0
foe 0
of 0
Israel. 0

With 0
the 0
Democrats 0
now 0
regaining 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
House, 0
Tlaib 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
energetic 0
proponent 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
majority’s 0
vendetta 1
against 1
the 0
Middle 0
East’s 0
only 0
democracy. 0

The 0
House 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
do 0
all 0
it 0
can 0
to 0
roll 0
back 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
pro-Israel 0
polices, 0
with 0
Tlaib 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Omar 0
as 0
becoming 0
the 0
public 0
faces 0
of 0
the 0
effort. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
JTA, 0
when 0
Tlaib 0
was 0
asked 0
if 0
she 0
would 0
vote 0
against 0
military 0
aid 0
to 0
Israel, 0
Tlaib 0
responded: 0
“Absolutely, 0
if 0
it 0
has 0
something 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
inequality 0
and 0
not 0
access 0
to 0
people 0
having 0
justice. 0

For 1
me, 1
U.S. 1
aid 1
should 1
be 1
leverage. 1

I 1
will 1
be 1
using 1
my 1
position 1
in 1
Congress 1
so 1
that 1
no 1
country, 1
not 1
one, 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
get 1
aid 1
from 1
the 1
U.S. 1
when 1
they 1
still 1
promote 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
injustice.” 1

What 0
kind 0
of 0
injustice? 0

Tlaib, 1
of 1
course, 1
had 1
nothing 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
the 1
genocidal 1
incitement 1
against 1
Jews 1
and 1
Israel 1
that 1
regularly 1
features 1
on 1
Palestinian 1
television. 1

She 0
did 0
say, 0
however, 0
that 0
she 0
favors 0
a 0
one-state, 0
not 0
two-state, 0
“solution” 0
to 0
the 0
Israeli-Palestinian 0
conflict: 0
“One 0
state. 0

It 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
one 0
state. 0

Separate 0
but 0
equal 0
does 0
not 0
work. 0

I’m 0
only 0
42 0
years 0
old 0
but 0
my 0
teachers 0
were 0
of 0
that 0
generation 0
that 0
marched 0
with 0
Martin 0
Luther 0
King. 0

This 0
whole 0
idea 0
of 0
a 0
two-state 0
solution, 0
it 1
doesn’t 1
work.” 1

Indeed 0
it 0
doesn’t. 0

A 0
Palestinian 0
state 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
new 0
base 0
for 0
renewed 0
jihad 0
attacks 0
against 0
Israel. 0

But 0
a 0
“one-state 0
solution” 0
would 0
be 0
even 0
worse, 0
unless 0
that 0
state 0
is 0
the 0
current 0
State 0
of 0
Israel, 0
but 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
one 0
state 0
Tlaib 0
has 0
in 0
mind. 0

She 0
is 0
calling 0
for 0
an 0
Israeli/Palestinian 0
state 0
that 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
Jewish 0
State 0
or 0
a 0
homeland 0
for 0
the 0
Jewish 0
people, 0
but 0
a 0
federation 0
in 0
which 0
Palestinians 0
would 0
soon 0
overwhelm 0
Jews 0
demographically. 0

Progressive 0
denial 0
of 0
their 0
rights 0
would 0
soon 0
follow: 0
as 0
I 0
show 0
in 0
my 0
book 0
The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
From 0
Muhammad 0
to 0
ISIS, 0
there 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
a 0
majority 0
Muslim 0
nation 0
in 0
which 0
Jews 0
enjoyed 0
equality 0
of 0
rights 0
with 0
Muslims. 0

Tlaib’s 0
unitary 0
state 0
would 0
be 0
no 0
different. 0

The 0
hijabed 0
(and 0
therefore 0
pro-Sharia) 0
Ilhan 0
Omar, 0
meanwhile, 0
is 1
even 1
more 1
hateful 1
than 1
Tlaib. 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Wire, 0
in 0
2012 0
Omar 0
tweeted: 0
“Israel 0
has 0
hypnotized 1
the 0
world, 0
may 0
Allah 0
awaken 0
the 0
people 0
and 0
help 0
them 0
see 0
the 1
evil 1
doings 1
of 1
Israel. 1

#Gaza 0
#Palestine 0
#Israel.” 0
Challenged 0
about 0
this 0
tweet 0
much 0
more 0
recently, 0
she 1
doubled 1
down 1
and 1
attacked 1
the 0
man 0
who 0
called 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
tweet: 0
“Drawing 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
apartheid 0
Israeli 0
regime 0
is 0
far 0
from 0
hating 0
Jews. 0

You 1
are 1
a 1
hateful 1
sad 1
man, 1
I 1
pray 1
to 1
Allah 1
you 1
get 1
the 1
help 1
you 1
need 1
and 1
find 1
happiness.” 1

There 1
is 1
much, 1
much 1
worse 1
about 1
Omar. 1

David 0
Steinberg 0
of 0
PJ 0
Media 0
has 0
done 0
extraordinary 1
work 1
in 0
shedding 0
light 0
on 0
aspects 0
of 0
Omar’s 0
record 0
that 0
the 0
establishment 0
media 0
has 0
steadfastly 1
ignored. 1

Steinberg 0
reports 0
that 0
Omar 0
has 0
“faced 0
allegations 0
-- 0
soon 0
backed 0
by 0
a 0
remarkable 0
amount 0
of 0
evidence 0
-- 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
married 0
her 0
own 0
brother 0
in 0
2009, 0
and 0
was 0
still 0
legally 0
his 0
wife. 0

They 0
officially 0
divorced 0
in 0
December 0
2017. 0

The 0
motivation 0
for 0
the 0
marriage 0
remains 0
unclear. 0

However, 0
the 0
totality 0
of 0
the 0
evidence 0
points 0
to 0
possible 0
immigration 0
fraud 0
and 0
student 0
loan 0
fraud.” 0
What’s 0
more, 0
she 0
swore 0
to 0
apparent 0
falsehoods 0
in 0
court. 0

But 0
Leftists 0
rarely 0
have 0
to 0
answer 0
for 0
their 0
corruption, 0
and 0
in 0
a 0
Democrat 0
House, 0
Omar 0
will 0
much 0
more 0
likely 0
be 0
celebrated 0
than 0
investigated. 0

She 0
and 0
Tlaib 0
will 0
enjoy 0
establishment 0
media 0
accolades 0
as 0
they 0
pursue 0
their 0
hard-Left, 0
anti-American, 0
anti-Israel 0
agenda. 0

Their 0
presence 0
in 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
may 0
be 0
evidence 0
of 0
“diversity,” 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
disquieting 0
sign 0
of 0
the 0
continued 0
dominance 0
of 0
identity 0
politics, 0
and 0
the 1
increasing 1
balkanization 1
of 0
the 0
American 0
body 0
politic. 0

Forthrightly 1
pro-America, 1
pro-Israel 1
candidates 1
would 1
stand 1
little 1
to 1
no 1
chance 1
in 1
either 1
of 1
their 1
districts. 1

And 1
that 1
is 1
indicative 1
of 1
a 1
much 1
larger 1
problem. 1

the 0
latest 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
debate 0
between 0
Leftists 0
and 0
the 0
Administration 0
looks 0
like, 0

another 0

Progressives 0
are 0
trying 0

progress 0
being 0
done 0

No 0

should 0
be 0
surprised 0
by 0
the 0
crackdown 0
on 0
illegals 0
entering 0
the 0
country, 0
especially 0
since 0
it 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
major 0
campaign 0

Donald 0

made 0
before 0

the 0
separation 0

there 0
is 0
nothing 0

today 0
that 0
was 0
not 0
being 0
done 0
during 0
the 0

In 0

Obama 0
began 0

literally 0
over 0
a 0
hundred 0
thousand 0
people, 0
mainly 0

not 0

The 0
surge 0
of 0
children 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
from 0
various 0
countries 0
south 0
of 0
the 0
border 0
was 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
economics, 0
high 0
crime 0
rates, 0
and 0
actual 0
threats 0
from 0
organized 0
crime 0
entities. 0

Another 0
excuse 1
used 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
government 0
was 0
to 0
bring 0
them 0
here 0
to 0
find 0
their 0
families 0
already 0
in 0
the 0
US. 0

Thus, 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
separating 1
children 0
from 0
their 0
parents 0
as 0
being 0
something 0
new, 0
done 0
only 0
by 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
is 0
absurd, 1
since 0
we 0
really 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
whether 0
the 0
children 0
brought 0
here 0
during 0
the 0
Obama 0
reign 0
were 0
intentionally 0
separated 1
from 0
their 0
parents 0
by 0
the 0
US 0
government 0
at 0
that 0
time, 0
or 0
not. 0

We 0
have 0
only 0
what 0
little 0
information 0
the 0
government 0
told 0
us 0
then, 0
which 0
was 0
not 0
very 0
much, 0
considering 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Obama 0
wanted 0
to 0
keep 0
as 0
much 0
of 0
this 0
situation 0
as 0
secret 0
as 0
possible. 0

What 0
many 0
do 0
not 0
realize 0
is, 0
today's 0
policy 0
of 0
separating 1
underage 0
siblings 0
from 0
their 0
parents 0
once 0
they 0
cross 0
the 0
border 0
illegally 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
planned 0
event 0
by 0
the 0
US 0
government 0
going 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
domestic 0
military 0
exercises 0
known 0
as 0
Jade 0
Helm 0
in 0
2015. 0

Many 0
remember 0
the 0
military 0
taking 0
over 0
several 0
Walmart 0
locations, 0
mainly 0
in 0
Texas, 0
during 0
the 0
Jade 0
Helm 0
exercises. 0

This, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
grab 0
of 0
millions 0
of 0
acres 0
of 0
land 0
during 0
the 0
Obama 0
years, 0
speaks 0
volumes 0
in 0
the 0
government's 0
plan 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
handle 0
millions 0
of 0
people. 0

Since 0
Obama 0
planned 0
to 0
have 0
over 0
a 0
million 0
Muslim 0
refugees 0
brought 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
over 0
a 0
short 0
period 0
of 0
time, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
coming 0
in, 0
one 0
can 0
understand 0
the 0
reason 0
the 0
Feds 0
had 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
Walmart 0
stores 0
and 0
so 0
much 0
land, 0
as 0
they 0
needed 0
housing 0
for 0
the 0
millions 0
they 0
planned 0
to 0
bring 0
in. 0

Despite 0
President 0
Trump 0
signing 0
an 0
Executive 0
Order 0
suspending 0
Syrian 0
refugees 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
US 0
for 0
120 0
days 0
on 0
Jan. 0
26, 0
2017 0
while 0
security 0
measures 0
were 0
reviewed, 0
the 0
US 0
still 0
imported 0
110,000 0
refugees 0
from 0
Syria 0
and 0
various 0
other 0
countries 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
in 0
2017 0
alone, 0
up 0
from 0
85,000 0
the 0
previous 0
year. 0

These 0
numbers 0
follow 0
Obama's 0
projections 0
of 0
the 0
expected 0
amount 0
of 0
refugees 0
permitted 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
US. 0

Of 0
course, 0
as 0
with 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
entering 0
our 0
county, 0
the 0
Feds 0
downplay 0
the 0
actual 0
number 0
which 0
always 0
ends 0
up 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
than 0
quadruple 0
their 0
stated 0
number. 0

What 0
we 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
here 0
with 0
the 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
situation 0
today 0
is 0
some 1
very 1
good 1
actors 1
on 1
the 1
Left 1
accusing 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
of 0
being 0
cruel 1
and 0
insensitive 1
with 0
separating 1
children 0
from 0
their 0
families 0
once 0
they 0
cross 0
the 0
Mexican 0
border 0
into 0
the 0
US. 0

When 0
in 0
fact, 0
their 0
idol, 1
Obama 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
for 0
years 0
during 0
his 0
time 0
in 0
power. 0

What 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
admit 0
to 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
today's 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
picture 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
follows 0
the 0
Obama 0
plan 0
on 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
influx 0
of 0
illegals 0
to 0
a 0
carbon 0
copy. 0

President 0
Trump, 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
is 0
following 0
along 0
with 0
it 0
by 0
detaining 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
at 0
the 0
border 0
and 0
separating 1
children 0
from 0
their 0
apparent 0
families. 0

Since 0
no 0
one 0
can 0
know 0
if 0
the 0
children 0
really 0
belong 0
to 0
the 0
illegals 0
who 0
say 0
they 0
are 0
their 0
parents, 0
they 0
are 0
separated 1
until 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
verified, 0
along 0
with 0
other 0
background 0
findings. 0

The 0
bottom 0
line 0
is, 0
both 0
the 0
Left 0
and 0
the 0
Trump 0
Administration 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
following 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
plan 0
of 0
action 0
going 0
back 0
to 0
Jade 0
Helm 0
which 0
paved 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
housing 0
needed 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
huge 0
influx 0
of 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
and 0
refugees. 0

All 0
of 0
which 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
planned 0
event. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
neither 0
side 0
in 0
DC 0
is 0
really 0
interested 0
in 0
solving 0
the 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
problem 0
or 0
cares 0
about 0
the 0
children 0
involved. 0

If 0
they 0
were, 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
no 0
detention 0
and 0
separation 1
after 0
illegally 0
coming 0
into 0
the 0
US, 0
only 0
an 0
immediate 0
deportation 0
by 0

Why 0

Yesterday, 0
the 0

boldly 1
advanced 0
in 0
a 0
coordinated 0
effort 0
to 0
silence 0
people 0
who 0
dissent 0

more 0
than 0
2 0

this 1

But 0
of 0
course, 0
since 0
they 0
too 0
push 0
political 0
messages 0
for 0
profit 0
(waaah, 0
Trump!) 0

as 0
do 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
corporate 0
media 0
outlets 0
out 0
there, 0
they 0
changed 0
their 0
headline 0
to 0
“Facebook 0
purged 0
over 0
800 0
U.S. 0
accounts 0
and 0
pages 0
for 0
pushing 0
political 0
spam.” 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
accounts 0
were 0
also 0
suspended 0
by 0
Twitter 0
shortly 0
thereafter 0
should 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
this 1
is 1
a 1
coordinated 1
effort 1
to 1
silence 1
large 1
swaths 1
of 1
the 1
population. 1

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
best 0
coverage 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
from…Russia. 0

Sputnik 0
News 0
contacted 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
alternative 0
journalists 0
who 0
were 0
purged 0
to 0
get 0
their 0
take 0
on 0
what 0
happened. 0

You 0
may 0
recall 0
that 0
basically 0
every 0
blogger 0
outside 0
the 0
establishment 0
media 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
being 0
secretly 0
Russian 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
by 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
so 0
perhaps 0
actual 0
Russians 0
have 0
a 0
vested 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
truth 0
coming 0
out 0
on 0
this 0
topic. 0

My 0
friend 0
John 0
Vibes 0
is 0
an 1
amazing 1
person 1
who 0
contributes 0
to 0
The 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project. 0

He 0
said: 0

This 0
signifies 0
a 0
re-consolidation 0
of 0
the 0
media. 0

Cable 0
news 0
media 0
controlled 0
the 0
narrative 0
for 0
most 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
but 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
lowered 0
that 0
barrier 0
to 0
entry 0
and 0
allowed 0
the 0
average 0
person 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
media 0
themselves. 0

This 0
obviously 0
took 0
market 0
share 0
and 0
influence 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
traditional 0
media, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
allowed 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
diverse 0
public 0
conversation. 0

Now 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
platforms 0
that 0
have 0
monopolized 0
the 0
industry 0
are 0
favoring 0
mainstream 0
sources 0
and 0
silencing 0
alternative 0
voices. 0

So 0
now, 0
instead 0
of 0
allowing 0
more 0
people 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
voice, 0
these 0
platforms 0
are 0
creating 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
where 0
only 0
powerful 0
media 0
organizations 0
are 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
had 0
on 0
cable 0
news. 0

People 0
think 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
just 0
providing 0
an 0
activist 0
spin 0
on 0
the 0
news, 0
but 0
they 0
don’t 0
see 0
the 0
families 0
struggling 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
voice 0
heard. 0

For 0
example, 0
when 0
someone 0
is 0
shot 0
by 0
police, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
sources 0
often 0
just 0
republish 0
the 0
press 0
release 0
from 0
the 0
police 0
department, 0
without 0
presenting 0
the 0
victim’s 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story. 0

We 0
give 0
the 0
victims 0
and 0
their 0
families 0
a 0
voice, 0
which 0
is 0
essential 0
to 0
keep 0
power 0
in 0
check. 0

This 0
also 0
goes 0
for 0
bigger 0
issues 0
like 0
foreign 0
policy 0
as 0
well; 0
multiple 0
full-scale 0
invasions 0
of 0
Syria 0
have 0
been 0
prevented 0
because 0
of 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
alternative 0
media 0
made 0
viral. 0

I 0
consider 0
a 0

wholeheartedly. 1

Our 0

generally 0
is 0
to 0
cover 0

angles 0
that 0
corporate 0

underreport 0

misreport 0
and 0
to 0
amplify 0

voices 0
and 0
stories. 0

All 0
of 0
our 0
content 0
is 0
professionally 0
fact-checked 0
and 0
edited. 0

I 0
got 0
into 0
this 0
line 0
of 0
work 0
because 0
I 0
felt 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
need 0
for 0
media 0
that 0
challenged 0
mainstream 0
assumptions 0
and 0
biases 0
in 0
politics. 0

I 0
wanted 0
to 0
shed 0
light 0
on 0
corruption 0
and 0
wrongdoing 0
against 0
oppressed 0
peoples 0
and 0
cover 0
the 0
harsh 1
truth 1
about 0
American 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Over 0
the 0
last 0
28 0
days, 0
we 0
reached 0
7,088,000 0
people 0
on 0
Facebook. 0

The 0
timing 0
of 0
this 0
purge 0
is 0
rather 0
dubious 1
in 0
my 0
view, 0
coming 0
shortly 0
before 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections. 0

This 1
could 1
be 1
an 1
attempt 1
by 1
Facebook 1
itself 1
to 1
affect 1
the 1
outcome 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
elections. 1

The 0
Twitter 0
suspension 0
caught 0
me 0
by 0
surprise. 0

I 0
can 0
only 0
speculate 0
that 0
these 0
suspensions 0
were 0
a 1
coordinated 1
effort 1
to 1
stifle 1
our 1
message 1
ahead 1
of 1
the 1
coming 1
elections. 1

(source) 0

Remember, 0
this 0
is 0
coordinated, 1
across 0
multiple 0
platforms. 0

Remember 0
when 0
this 0
happened 0
to 0
Alex 0
Jones? 0

Back 0
in 0
September, 0
an 0
assault 1
was 0
led 0
by 0
YouTube, 0
Google, 0
and 0
Facebook 0
against 0
Alex 0
Jones 0
of 0
Infowars 0
fame. 0

All 0
of 0
his 0
accounts 0
were 0
shut 0
down 0
in 0
quick 0
succession, 0
followed 0
by 0
his 0
credit 0
card 0
processing 0
companies 0
and 0
his 0
newsletter 0
service 0
providers. 0

I 0
wrote 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
“Alex 0
Jones 0
is 0
just 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
this 0
purge. 0

It’s 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
much 0
worse.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
other 0
dissenting 0
voices 0
were 0
being 0
silenced 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
with 0
limited 0
reach 0
and 0
“shadow 0
banning.” 0

Infowars 0
is 0
a 0
massive 0
profit 0
machine. 0

But 0
what 0
happens 0
when 0
similar 0
attacks 0
are 0
launched 0
on 0
smaller 0
alternative 0
media 0
outlets? 0

It 0
hits 0
us 0
right 0
in 0
the 0
wallet. 0

And 0
if 0
they’re 0
hit 0
hard 0
enough, 0
they’ll 0
cease 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
function. 0

Jones 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
money 0
so 0
this 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
him, 0
but 0
for 0
most 0
website 0
owners, 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
absolute 0
end 0
of 0
our 0
ability 0
to 0
do 0
business. 0

And 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
bring 0
the 0
information 0
we 0
bring, 0
we 0
do 0
have 0
to 0
run 0
our 0
websites 0
as 0
businesses. 0

It’s 0
far 0
more 0
expensive 0
than 0
most 0
people 0
realize 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
site. 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
my 0
own 0
operating 0
costs 0
every 0
month 0
are 0
more 0
than 0
$2000. 0

A 0
site 0
as 0
big 0
as 0
Jones’s 0
would 0
be 0
many 0
times 0
that 0
amount. 0

When 0
all 0
your 0
avenues 0
of 0
monetization 0
are 0
cut 0
off, 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
hard 0
for 0
a 0
site 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
dissent 0
and 0
information 0
they 0
share 0
– 0
to 0
cease 0

exist. 0

Paul 0
reminds 0

that 0
truth 0
is 0
treason. 0

Ron 0
Paul, 0
former 0
senator 0
and 0
the 0
libertarian 0
voice 0
of 0
reason, 0
said 0
when 0
Jones 0
was 0
purged: 0

“You 0
get 0
accused 0
of 0
treasonous 0
activity 0
and 0
treasonous 0
speech 0
because 0
in 0
an 0
empire 1
of 1
lies 1
the 0
truth 0
is 0
treason,” 0
Paul 0
told 0
the 0
Russia-based 0
news 0
outlet. 0

“Challenging 0
the 0
status 0
quo 0
is 0
what 0
they 0
can’t 0
stand 0
and 0
it 0
unnerves 0
them, 0
so 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
silence 0
people.” 0
“Some 0
of 0
us 0
tell 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
our 1
government, 1
they 0
call 0
us 0
treasonous 0

say 0
we’re 0
speaking 0
out 0

they’d 0
like 0
to 0

us, 0

I 0
think 0
that’s 0
part 0
of 0
what’s 0
happening 0

Paul 0
told 0
RT, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
hopes 0
anti-government 0
or 0
anti-war 0
voices 0
can 0
eliminate 0
their 0
“dependency” 0
on 0
the 0
current 0

“I’m 0
just 0
hoping 0
that 0

can 0
stay 0
ahead 0

all 0
and 0
that 0
we 0
can 0

companies 0
that 0

Here’s 0
a 0
video 0
from 0
last 0
month 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Paul’s 0
thoughts 0
about 0
the 0
social 0
media 0
purge. 0

In 0
it, 0
he 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
Facebook 0
is 0
a 0
private 0
entity 0
so 0
they 0
do 0
have 0
every 0
right 0
to 0
remove 0
the 0
pages 0
they 0
wish. 0

The 0
danger 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
area 0
in 0
which 0
this 0
treads 0
on 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
– 0
is 0
their 0
direct 0
ties 0
to 0
the 0
government. 0

This 0
affects 0
everyone. 0

If 0
you’re 0
reading 0
this 0
and 0
you 0
shrug 0
because 0
you, 0
personally, 0
don’t 0
have 0
a 0
Twitter 0
or 0
Facebook 0
account, 0
you’re 0
missing 0
the 0
bigger 0
point. 0

Consider 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
“population” 0
of 0
Facebook 0
is 0
bigger 0
than 0
the 0
populations 0
of 0
the 0
US, 0
China, 0
and 0
Brazil 0
combined. 0

That’s 0
how 0
many 0
people 0
will 0
now 0
only 0
receive 0
one 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
on 0
things 0
like 0
war, 0
politics, 0
guns, 0
and 0
current 0
events. 0

People 0
will 0
believe 0
what 0
they’re 0
told 0
because 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
alternative 0
information 0
presented. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
questions 0
asked. 0

It’s 0
literally 0
the 0
textbook 0
definition 0
of 0
brainwashing. 1

the 0

that 0

we’re 1

2.2 0

So 0
regardless 0

you, 0
personally, 0

this 0
will 0
color 0
popular 0
sentiment 0

a 0
massive 1
degree. 0

It 0
will 0
grow 0
the 0
cognitive 0
dissonance 0
that 0
assures 0
people 0
of 0
things 0
like 0
“the 1

What 0
can 0
you 0
do 0
about 0
the 0

It’s 0
possible 0
but 0
unlikely 0
that 0
social 0
pressure 0
on 0
Facebook 0

will 0
push 0
the 0

into 0
restoring 0

But 0
even 0

A 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
ago, 0
I 0
introduced 0
you 0
to 0
the 0
Hammon 0
family, 0
a 0
rancher 0
family 0
out 0
of 0
Oregon 0
that 0
was 0
targeted 0
after 0
the 0
patriarch 0
in 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
his 0
son 0
went 0
to 0
jail 0
for 0
doing 0
what 0
ranchers 0
do, 0
setting 0
fires 0
to 0
protect 0
property 0
and 0
livestock. 0

However, 0
in 0
the 0
day 0
and 0
age 0
of 0
unmitigated 0
"terrorism" 0
charges, 0
once 0
they 0
served 0
their 0
sentence 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
went 0
after 0
both 0
men 0
for 0
more 0
time 0
inside 0
their 0
prison 0
for 1
profit 1
system. 1

Their 0
story 0
ultimately 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
Malheur 0
Wildlife 0
Refuge 0
protest, 0
which 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
LaVoy 0
Finicum. 0

Now, 0

took 0

both 0
in 0
the 0

Sara 0
Berg, 0

of 0
the 0
lengthy 0
post 0
which 0
calls 0
for 0
all 0
sorts 0
of 0
government 0
overreach 0
and 0
unconstitutional 0
legislation. 0

And 0
though 0
she 0
has 0
a 0
huge 0
laundry 0
list 0
of 0
things 0
the 0
AMA 0
supports, 0
she 0
fails, 0
like 0
every 0
other 0
Socialist 0
and 0
Communist, 0
to 0
tell 0
us 0
exactly 0
how 0
these 0
measures 0
keep 0
people 0
safe 0
and 0
weapons 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
criminals. 0

Berg 0
and 0
the 0
AMA 0
want 0
to 0
pull 0
a 0
Dick's 0
Sporting 0
Goods 0
and 0
demand 0
that 0
people 0
be 0
21 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
purchase 0
a 0
firearm. 0

Does 0
Berg 0
and 0
the 0
AMA 0
support 0
our 1
military? 0

Do 0
they 0
not 0
know 0
that 0
18-year-olds 0
carry 0
firearms, 0
both 0
handguns 0
and 0
rifles? 0

I 0
ask, 0
as 0
I 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
issue 0
concerning 0
alcohol, 0
what 0
is 0
magic 0
about 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
21? 0

I 0
ask, 0
where 0
does 0
government 0
get 0
to 0
determine 0
who 0
gets 0
to 0
do 0
whatever 0
at 0
whatever 0
age 0
based 0
on 0
an 0
ambiguous 0
age 0
number? 0

Yet, 0
if 1
we 1
do 1
that, 1
we 1
won't 1
have 1
to 1
worry 1
about 1
mass 1
shooters, 1
right? 0

Wrong. 0

Yeah, 0
that's 0
gonna 0
keep 0
people 0
safe. 0

It's 0
going 0
to 0
infringe 0
on 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
don't 0
commit 0
crimes 0
and 0
need 0
a 0
gun 0
to 0
protect 0
themselves 0
or 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
constitutional 0
militia. 0

The 0
AMA 0
also 0
wants 0
to 0
bypass 0
the 0
Fifth 0
Amendment 0
protections 0
concerning 0
someone 0
actually 0
being 0
indicted 0
and 0
found 0
guilty 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
being 0
deprived 0
of 0
their 0
liberty 0
and 0
property 0
as 0
they 0
promote 0
a 0
new 0
legal 0
procedure 0
by 0
which 0
“family 0
members, 0
intimate 0
partners, 0
household 0
members 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
personnel” 0
can 0
petition 0
courts 0
to 0
confiscate 0
firearms 0
from 0
people 0
“when 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
high 0
or 0
imminent 0
risk 0
for 0
violence.” 0

They 0
want 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
suggested 0
and 0
"take 0
the 0
guns 0
first" 0
and 0
forget 0
due 0
process. 0

See? 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
honest 0
about 0
who 0
they 0
are 0
and 0
name 0

denying 0
them 0
their 0

base 0

allow 0
for 0
the 0
removal 0

The 0
delegates 0
also 0
modified 0
existing 0
policy 0
to: 0
Recognize 0
the 0
role 0
of 0
firearms 0
in 0
suicides. 0

Encourage 0
the 0
development 0
of 0

for 0
physicians 0
with 0
a 0
focus 0
on 0
suicide 0

and 0

as 0

a 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
suicide 0

to 0
discuss 0

and 0
work 0

to 0
reduce 0

Newly 0
adopted 0
policy 0
also 0
means 0
the 0
AMA 0
will: 0

Advocate 0
for 0
schools 0
to 0
remain 0
gun-free 0
zones 0
except 0
for 0
school-sanctioned 0
activities 0
and 0
professional 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officials. 0

Oppose 0
requirements 0
or 0
incentives 0
of 0
teachers 0
to 0
carry 0
weapons. 0

They 0
also 0
oppose 0
concealed 0
carry 0
reciprocity, 0
which 0
I 0
do 0
as 0
well, 0
but 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
principle 0
that 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment's 0
protections 0
extend 0
to 0
the 0
various 0
states 0
as 0
well, 0
since 0
it 0
recognizes 0
a 1
right, 1
not 1
a 1
permission, 1
to 1
keep 1
and 1
bear 1
arms. 1

I 0
also 0
oppose 0
it 0
because 0
it's 0
just 0
another 0
step 0
for 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
to 0
say 0
they 0
need 0
a 0
database 0
so 0
states 0
can 0
check, 0
thus 0
identifying 0
gun 0
owners 0
and 0
possibly 0
their 0
weapons. 0

“People 0
are 0

our 1
homes, 0

on 0

at 0

it’s 0

that 0

on 0
all 0

“In 0

that 0

Eleven 0

were 0

arrested. 0

Thursday 0
afternoon 0
Sheriff 0
Jerry 0
Hogrefe 0
swore 0
out 0
an 0
affidavit 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
that 0
states 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
makeshift 0
compound 0
surrounded 0
by 0
tires 0
and 0
an 0
earthen 0
berm 0
in 0
Costilla 0
Meadows 0
subdivision 0
that 0
he 0
reasonably 0
believed 0
was 0
occupied 0
by 0
adult 0
Lucas 0
Morton 0
and 0
others, 0
including 0
39-year-old 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
who 0
was 0
wanted 0
for 0
child 0
abduction 0
and 0
3-year-old 0
AG 0
Wahhaj, 0
the 0
child 0
that 0
was 0
abducted. 0

This 0
warrant 0
came 0
after 0
a 0
two-month 0
investigation 0
in 0
conjunction 0
with 0
Clayton 0
County, 0
Georgia 0
and 0
FBI 0
investigators. 0

According 0
to 0
Sheriff 0
Hogrefe 0
the 0
FBI 0
had 0
recently 0
provided 0
information 0
and 0
surveillance 0
on 0
this 0
location, 0
but 0
they 0
(FBI) 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
there 0
was 0
enough 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
get 0
on 0
the 0
property. 0

In 0
the 0
press 0
release 0
Sheriff 0
Hogrefe 0
said, 0
“That 0
all 0
changed 0
for 0
me 0
when 0
a 0
message 0
was 0
forwarded 0
to 0
us 0
from 0
a 0
Georgia 0
Detective 0
that 0
we 0
reasonably 0
believed 0
came 0
from 0
someone 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
– 0
the 0
message 0
sent 0
to 0
a 0
third 0
party 0
simply 0
said 0
in 0
part 0
“we 0
are 0
starving 0
and 0
need 0
food 0
and 0
water”. 0

I 0
absolutely 0
knew 0
that 0
we 0
couldn’t 0
wait 0
on 0
another 0
agency 0
to 0
step 0
up 0
and 0
we 0
had 0
to 0
go 0
check 0
this 0
out 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible, 0
so 0
I 0
began 0
working 0
on 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
right 0
after 0
I 0
got 0
that 0
intercepted 0
message 0
– 0
it 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
and 0
a 0
tactical 0
approach 0
for 0
our 0
own 0
safety 0
because 0
we 0
had 0
learned 0
the 0
occupants 0
were 0
most 0
likely 0
heavily 0
armed 0
and 0
considered 0
extremist 1
of 1
the 1
Muslim 1
belief. 1

We 0
also 0
knew 0
from 0
the 0
layout 0
of 0
the 0
compound 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
an 0
advantage 0
if 0
we 0
didn’t 0
deploy 0
tactfully 0
and 0
quickly.” 0

On 0

2018, 0
eight 0
members 0
of 0
TCSO’s 0
Sheriff’s 0
Response 0
Team 0
(SRT) 0
were 0
assisted 0
by 0
four 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
OSI 0
unit 0
when 0
they 0
executed 0
the 0
search 0
warrant. 0

The 0
“all 0
day” 0
operation 0
went 0
without 0
major 0
incident 0
or 0
any 0
injuries, 0
but 0
when 0
encountered 0
both 0
men 0
initially 0
refused 0
to 0
follow 0
verbal 0
direction 0
and 0
Wahhaj 0
who 0
was 0
held 0
up 0
inside 0
the 0
compound 0
was 0
heavily 0
armed 0
with 0
an 0
AR15 0
rifle, 0
five 0
loaded 0
30 0
round 0
magazines, 0
and 0
four 0
loaded 0
pistols, 0
including 0
one 0
in 0
his 0
pocket 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
taken 0
down. 0

Many 0
more 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammo 0
were 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
makeshift 0
compound 0
that 0
consists 0
of 0
a 0
small 0
travel 0
trailer 0
buried 0
in 0
the 0
ground 0
covered 0
by 0
plastic 0
with 0
no 0
water, 0
plumbing, 0
or 0
electricity. 0

“The 0
only 0
food 0
We 0
saw 0
were 0
a 0
few 0
potatoes 0
and 0
a 0
box 0
of 0
rice 0
in 0
the 0
filthy 0
trailer,” 0
said 0
Hogrefe. 0

“But 0
what 0
was 0
most 1
surprising, 1
and 1
heartbreaking 1
was 0
when 0
the 0
team 0
located 0
a 0
total 0
of 0
five 1
adults 1
and 1
11 1
children 1
that 1
looked 1
like 1
third 1

refugees 1
not 0
only 0
with 0
no 0
food 0
or 0
fresh 0
water, 0
but 0
with 0
no 0
shoes, 0
personal 0
hygiene 0
and 0
basically 0
dirty 1
rags 1
for 1
clothing.” 1

The 0
body 0
of 0
a 0
yound 0
boy 0
was 0
also 0
located, 0
however, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
clear 0
if 0
the 0
boy 0
is 0
the 0
missing 0
child 0
from 0
Georgia. 0

Both 0
males 0
were 0
arrested; 0
Morton 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
harboring 0
a 0
fugitive 0
and 0
Wahhaj 0
was 0
booked 0
on 0
his 0
no 0
bond 0
Georgia 0
warrant 0
for 0
child 0
abduction. 0

The 0
three 0
females 0
believed 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
mothers 0
of 0
the 0
eleven 0
children, 0
Jany 0
Leveille 0
age 0
35, 0
Hujrah 0
Wahhaj 0
age 0
38, 0
and 0
Subhannah 0
Wahhaj 0
age 0
35 0
were 0
arrested 0
without 0
incident 0
in 0
Taos 0
and 0
were 0
later 0
booked 0
in 0
the 0
Taos 0
Adult 0
Detention 0
Center. 0

“We 0
all 0
gave 0
the 0
kids 0
our 0
water 0
and 0
what 0
snacks 0
we 0
had 0
– 0
it 1
was 1
the 1
saddest 1
living 1
conditions 1
and 1
poverty 1
I 1
have 1
seen.” 1

None 0
of 0
the 0
adults 0
would 0
give 0
statement 0
to 0
the 0
current 0
whereabouts 0
of 0
AG 0
Wahhaj, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
reasonably 0
believed 0
he 0
was 0
there 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0

Kritarch 1
Patti 1

thinks 1

runs 1
immigration 1
policy, 1
right 0
down 0
to 0
how 0
many 0
times 0
someone 0
can 0
have 0
their 0
case 0
reviewed, 0
though 0
she 0
seems 0
confused 0
as 0
to 0
who 0
will 0
do 0
the 0
reviewing 0
of 0
those 0
cases. 0

At 0
issue 0
is 0
a 0
large 0
group 0
of 0
Indonesian 0
Chinese 0
Christians 0
who 0
fled 0
a 0
pogrom 1
in 0
Indonesia 0
directed 0
against 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
1990s. 0

The 0
Chinese 0
generally 0
filed 0
asylum 0
applications 0
after 0
arriving 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and, 0
importantly, 0
not 0
at 0
an 0
American 0
embassy 0
or 0
consulate 0
in 0
Indonesia 0
or 0
nearby. 0

All 0
were 0
relatively 0
wealthy 0
and 0
had 0
or 0
obtained 0
tourist 0
visas 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

This 0
is 0
important 0
as 0
most 0
actual 0
"refugees" 0
drop 0
everything 0
to 0
flee 0
their 0
homelands 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
under 0
threat 0
of 0
death. 0

Tellingly, 1
these 1
asylum 1
applicants 1
were 1
the 1
elite 1
of 1
Indonesian 1
society, 1
because 1
their 1
higher 1
average 1
IQ, 1
than 1
the 1
rather 1
dull 1
Indonesians. 1

87 0
is 0
the 0
average 0
Indonesian 0
IQ 0
, 0
and 0
note 0
that 0
average 0
includes 0
the 0
higher 0
average 0
Chinese, 0
so 1
the 1
locals 1
really 1
are 1
a 1
dull 1
lot. 1

This 0
is 0
important 0
in 0
that 0
while 0
there 0
was 0
anti-Chinese 0
and 0
anti-Christian 0
violence, 0
the 0
non-Chinese 0
Christians 0
mostly 0
stuck 0
around, 0
though 0
the 0
Chinese 0
used 0
tourist 0
and 0
student 0
visas 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
in 0
a 0
leisurely 0
manner, 0
taking 0
time 0
to 0
either 0
bring 0
or 0
otherwise 0
secure 0
their 0
wealth 0
in 0
Indonesia. 0

In 0
any 0
event, 0
the 0
persecution 0
was 0
limited 0
in 0
time 0
and 0
duration 0
as 0
the 0
local 0
elite 0
know 0
they 0
need 0
the 0
Chinese 0
to 0
run 0
the 0
economy 0
and 0
to 0
avoid 0
Red 1
China 1
intervening 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
their 0
fellow 0
ethnics. 0

In 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
these 0
Chinese 0
went 0
through 0
the 0
liberal 0
asylum 0
process, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
manage 0
to 0
fool 1
even 1
the 1
credulous 1
"judges" 1
at 0
the 0
Executive 0
Office 0
for 0
Immigration 0
Review 0
(EOIR), 0
the 0
immigration 0
courts. 0

Fast 0
forward 0
to 0
the 0
Obama 0
Regime 0
Administrative 0
Amnesty 0
, 0
where 0
despite 0
outstanding 0
deportation 0
orders, 0
these 0
illegal 0
aliens, 0
among 0
millions 0
of 0
others, 0
are 0
allowed 0
to 0
remain, 0
and 0
then 0
given 0
employment 0
authorization 0
as 0
well. 0

Fortunately, 1
elections 1
have 1
consequences, 1
and 1
the 1
Obama 1
Regime 1
Administrative 1
Amnesty, 1
or 1
parts 1
of 1
it, 1
came 1
to 1
an 1
inglorious 1
end. 1

And 0
end 0
it 0
was 0
for 0
this 0
particular 0
lot 0
of 0
illegal 0
aliens. 0

But 0
Kritarch 0
Patti 0
Saris 0
was 0
having 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
immigration 0
laws 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

She 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
decider-in-chief 1
on 1
who 1
gets 1
deported. 1

And 0
all 0
on 0
the 0
flimsy 0
excuse 0
that 0
the 0
aliens 1
need 0
another 1
bite 1
at 1
the 1
apple, 1
despite 0
the 0
clear 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Indonesian 0
government 0
had 0
long 0
ago 0
quashed 0
the 0
ethnic 0
riots 0
directed 0
against 0
the 0
market 0
dominant 0
minority 0
of 0
Chinese 0
and 0
the 0
religious 0
motivated 0
violence 0
against 0
Christians. 0

While 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
provinces 0
in 0
Indonesia 0
that 0
impose 0
Sharia 0
law 0
on 0
Muslims, 0
most 0
non-Muslims 0
are 0
exempt. 0

As 0
moderates 0
go, 0
Indonesia 0
is 0
about 0
as 0
close 0
as 0
it 0
gets 0
to 0
moderate 0
Muslims. 0

Mostly 0
because 0
the 1
country 1
would 1
not 1
last 1
long 1
without 1
an 1
outside 1
high 1
IQ 1
elite 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
country. 1

Before 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
high 0
IQ 0
Dutch, 0
now 0
it's 0
the 0
Chinese. 0

Remember, 0
an 1

about 1

Chief 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Judge 0
Patti 0
Saris 0
in 0
Boston 0
found 0
she 0
had 0
authority 0
to 0
ensure 0
the 0
Indonesians 0
have 0
a 0

that 0

to 0
reopen 0
their 0

for 0

She 0
worried 0
that 0
without 0

officials 0
could 0
deport 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
Indonesians 0
covered 0

at 0
which 0

Kritarch 0
Saris 0
thought 0
she 0
knew 0
better 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
running 0
a 0
deliberate 0
campaign 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
deportation 0
of 0
these 0
Chinese 0
illegal 1
aliens. 1

And 0
now 0
she 1
has 1
gone 1
full 1
rogue, 1
prohibiting 0
the 0
deportation 0
of 0
all 0
these 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
who 0
already 0
had 0
their 0
day 0
in 0
immigration 0
court.Saris 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
making 0
up 0
immigration 0
law 0
and 0
procedure 0
on 0
the 0
fly, 0
as 0
her 0
order 0
appears 0
to 0
not 0
understand 0
either 0
the 0
EOIR 0
process 0
or 0
immigration 0
law. 0

“The 0
government 0
shall 0
inform 0
the 0
court 0
whether 0
petitioners, 0
who 0
are 0
not 0
detained, 0
will 0
have 0
access 0
to 0
emergency 0
procedures 0
if 0
they 0
must 0
file 0
their 0
original 0
motions 0
to 0
reopen,” 0
Saris 0
wrote. 0

This 0
makes 0
no 0
sense 0
in 0
English, 0
much 0
less 0
in 0
the 0
established 0
procedures 0
in 0
the 0
EOIR. 0

The 0
aliens 1
have 0
no 0
emergency, 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
emergency 0
procedures, 0
and 0
their 0
original 0
motions 0
to 0
reopen 0
were 0
denied 0
for 0
lack 0
of 0
legal 0
basis 0
in 0
law 0
or 0
any 0
changed 0
conditions 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
deported 0
to 0
that 0
would 0
avail 0
them 0
of 0
another 0
claim. 0

Indonesia 0
is 0
more 0
hospitable 0
to 0
Chinese 0
Christians 0
today 0
than 0
the 0
short 0
period 0
in 0
the 0
90s 0
when 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
problem. 0

But 0
basically, 0
Saris 0
wants 0
the 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
submit 0
another 0
asylum 0
application, 0
and 0
benefit 0
by 0
the 0
years 0
it 0
will 0
take 0
to 0
adjudicate 0
those 0
claims. 0

Basically 0
Saris 0
wants 0
these 0
illegals 0
to 0
never 0
leave. 0

That, 0
of 0
course 0
is 0
not 0
her 0
role. 0

The 0
only 0
claim 0
they 0
have 0
before 0
a 0
Federal 0
court 0
is 0
if 0
they 0
got 0
the 0
due 0
process 0
that 0
Congress 0
gave 0
those 0
illegal 1
aliens. 1

And 0
they 0
did, 0
they 0
filed 0
for 0
asylum, 0
had 0
a 0
hearing 0
and 0
appeals, 0
and 0
lost. 0

With 0
the 0
legislative 0
fight 0
over 0
DACA, 0
the 0
Trump 0

needs 0
to 0
include 0
legislative 0

6,500 0

migrants, 0
this 0
time 0
from 0
El 0

has 0
reportedly 0
already 0
crossed 0
into 0

At 0

according 0
to 0

the 0

might 0
dissolve 0
along 0

about 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

number 0
of 0

and, 0
if 0
not, 0
suppress 1
them 1

Ebola 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
world's 0
most 0
notorious 0
diseases, 0
being 0
both 0
highly 1
infectious 1
and 1
extremely 1
lethal. 1

It 0
is 0
caused 0
by 0
a 0
virus 0
that 0
has 0
a 0
natural 0
reservoir 0
in 0
the 0
bat, 0
which 0
does 0
not 0
itself 0
fall 0
ill, 0
but 0
can 0
pass 0
the 0
microbe 0
on 0
to 0
humans 0
who 0
hunt 0
it 0
for 0
"bushmeat". 0

The 0
virus 0
is 0
handed 0
on 0
by 0
contact 0
with 0
bodily 0
fluids 0
-- 0
touching 0
a 0
sick 0
or 0
dead 0
person 0
is 0
a 0
well-known 0
source 0
of 0
infection. 0

Following 0
an 0
incubation 0
period 0
of 0
between 0
two 0
and 0
21 0
days, 0
Ebola 0
develops 0
into 0
a 0
high 0
fever, 0
weakness, 0
intense 0
muscle 0
and 0
joint 0
pain, 0
headaches 0
and 0
a 0
sore 0
throat. 0

That 0
is 0
often 0
followed 0
by 0
vomiting 0
and 0
diarrhoea, 0
skin 0
eruptions, 0
kidney 0
and 0
liver 0
failure, 0
and 0
internal 0
and 0
external 0
bleeding. 0

The 0
worst-ever 0
Ebola 0
outbreak 0
started 0
in 0
December 0
2013 0
in 0
southern 0
Guinea 0
before 0
spreading 0
to 0
two 0
neighbouring 0
west 0
African 0
countries, 0
Liberia 0
and 0
Sierra 0
Leone. 0

That 0
outbreak 0
killed 0
more 0
than 0
11,300 0
people 0
out 0
of 0
nearly 0
29,000 0
registered 0
cases, 0
according 0
to 0
WHO 0
estimates, 0
although 0
the 0
real 0
figure 0
is 0
thought 0
to 0
be 0
significantly 0
higher. 0

More 0
than 0
99 0
percent 0
of 0
victims 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
three 0
West 0
African 0
countries, 0
although 0
cases 0
occurred 0
in 0
other 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world, 0
often 0
stirring 0
panic. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
current 0
vaccine 0
to 0
prevent 0
Ebola 0
or 0
licensed 0
treatment 0
for 0
it, 0
although 0
a 0
range 0
of 0
experimental 0
drugs 0
are 0
in 0
development. 0

Early 0
care 0
with 0
rehydration 0
may 0
boost 0
the 0
chance 0
of 0
survival. 0

Given 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
a 0
pharmaceutical 0
weapon 0
against 0
Ebola, 0
health 0
experts 0
have 0
responded 0
with 0
time-honoured 0
measures 0
of 0
control, 0
prevention 0
and 0
containment. 0

They 0
use 0
rigorous 0
protocols 0
to 0
protect 0
medical 0
personnel 0
with 0
disposable 0
full-body 0
suits, 0

the 0

the 0

surrounding 0
Russian 0
efforts 0

is 0
becoming 0
more 0
problematic 0
for 0

by 0
the 0
hour. 0

As 0
The 0
Hill 0
pointed 0
out 0
earlier 0
this 0
morning, 0
the 0
latest 0
development 0
in 0
this 0
sordid 1
tale 0
revolves 0
around 0
a 0
man 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
used 0
as 0
an 0
informant 0
back 0
in 0
2009 0
and 0
beyond 0
to 0
build 0
a 0
case 0
against 0
a 0
Russian 0
perpetrator 0
who 0
ultimately 0
admitted 0
to 0
bribery, 0
extortion 0
and 0
money 0

The 0
informant, 0
who 0
is 0
so 0
far 0
only 0
known 0
as 0
“Confidential 0
Source 0
1,” 0
says 0
that 0
when 0
he 0
attempted 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
last 0
year 0
with 0
information 0
that 0
linked 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation 0
directly 0
to 0
the 0
scandal 0
he 0
was 0
promptly 0
silenced 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

Working 0
as 0
a 0
confidential 0
witness, 0
the 0
businessman 0
made 0
kickback 0
payments 0
to 0
the 0
Russians 0
with 0
the 0
approval 0
of 0
his 0
FBI 0
handlers 0
and 0
gathered 0
other 0
evidence, 0
the 0
records 0
show. 0

Sources 0
told 0
The 0
Hill 0
the 0
informant’s 0
work 0
was 0
crucial 0

crack 0
a 0

on 0

In 0

Toensing 0
added 0
her 0
client 0
has 0

committees 0
seeking 0
information 0
about 0
what 0
he 0

inside 0
the 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
industry 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
unable 0

that 0

of 0
the 0

“He 0

upon 0
in 0

she 0

the 0

possesses 0
includes 0

out. 0

Sitting 0
down 0
with 0
The 0
Hill 0
earlier, 0
Toensing 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
last 0
time 0
her 0
client 0
tried 0
to 0
speak 0
out 0
“both 0
his 0
reputation 0

were 0
“threatened” 1
by 0
the 0
Obama 0

in 0
a 0
effort 0
to 0
force 0

“All 0

about 0
this 0

has 0
not 0
come 0
out,” 0
she 0
said 0
in 0
an 0

Tuesday. 0

“And 0
so 0
my 0
client, 0
the 0

of 0
my 0

that 0
made 0

Toensing 0

that 0
recount 0
how 0
the 0
Justice 0

last 0

threatened 1
her 0
client 0
when 0
he 0
attempted 0
to 0
file 0
a 0

that 0
could 0
have 0
drawn 0

to 0
the 0
Russian 0
corruption 0
during 0
the 0
2016 0

as 0

Russians 0
stole 0
from 0
him 0
through 0
kickbacks 0
during 0
the 0
FBI 0

The 0
undercover 0
client 0
witnessed 0
“a 0
lot 0
of 0
bribery 0
going 0
on 0
around 0
the 0
U.S.” 0
but 0
was 0
asked 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
to 0
sign 0

that 0
prevents 0
him 0
from 0
revealing 0
what 0
he 0
knows 0
to 0

Toensing 0
explained. 0

When 0
he 0
tried 0
to 0
bring 0
some 0

that 0
a 0

working 0

exerted 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
client 0
from 0
disclosing 0
to 0
a 0

what 0
he 0
knew 0
last 0

“The 0

In 0

she 0

“As 0

the 0

but 0
required 0
approval 0
from 0

Rep. 0

was 0
For/Against/For/Against 0
Farrakhan 0

Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
helped 0
get 0
the 0
ball 0
rolling 0
by 0
praising 0
Farrakhan. 0

Democratic 0
Illinois 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
defended 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan 0
as 0
an 0
“outstanding 1
human 1
being” 1
on 0
Monday. 0

Farrakhan’s 0
history 0
of 0
racially 0
extreme 0
comments 0
includes 0
blaming 0
Jews 0
for 0
the 0
September 0
11 0
attacks, 0
saying 0
white 0
people 0
“deserve 1
to 1
die” 1
and 0
praising 0
Adolf 0
Hitler 0
as 0
a 0
“very 1
great 1
man.” 1
“I 0
personally 1
know 1
[Farrakhan], 1
I’ve 1
been 1
to 1
his 1
home, 1
done 1
meetings, 1
participated 1
in 1
events 1
with 1
him,” 1
Davis 1
told 1
TheDC. 1

“I 1
don’t 1
regard 1
Louis 1
Farrakhan 1
as 1
an 1
aberration 1
or 1
anything, 1
I 1
regard 1
him 1
as 1
an 1
outstanding 1
human 1
being 1
who 1
commands 1
a 1
following 1
of 1
individuals 1
who 1
are 1
learned 1
and 1
articulate 1
and 1
he 1
plays 1
a 1
big 1
role 1
in 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
and 1
thousands 1
of 1
people,” 1
he 1
emphasized 1
later. 1

Then 0
Rep. 0
Davis' 0
office 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
disavowing 0
Farrakhan. 0

And 0
then 0
Davis 0
got 0
right 0
back 0
to 0
talking 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
and 0
disavowed 0
the 0
disavowal. 0

“The 0
congressman 0
was 0
insistent 0
that 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
misquoted 0
him 0
during 0
the 0
interview 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
subscribe 0
to 0
Farrakhan’s 0
anti-Semitic 0
statements 0
and 0
actions 0
in 0
the 0
past,” 0
the 0
ADL 0
official 0
told 0
JTA 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“He 0
expressed 0
an 0
interest 0
in 0
seeing 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
latest 0
statements 0
made 0
by 0
Farrakhan 0
vis-a-vis 0
Jews, 0
which 0
we 0
promptly 0
shared 0
with 0
him.” 0
The 0
congressman 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
why 0
the 0
ADL 0
wrote 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misquoted 0
in 0
his 0
praise 0
for 0
the 0
anti-Semite, 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
if 0
someone 0
from 0
his 0
office 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
ADL 0
he 0
was 0
misquoted, 0
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
News 0
Foundation 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

“I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
to 0
write. 0

Nah, 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
Farrakhan, 0
I 0
don’t 0
spend 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
my 0
time 0
dealing 0
with 0
those 0
kind 0
of 0
things,” 0
Davis 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
just 0
one 0
segment 0
of 0
what 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
our 0
world. 0

The 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
Farrakhan 1
and 1
the 1
Jewish 1
question 1
and 1
his 1
position 1
on 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
forth. 1

For 0
those 0
heavy 0
into 0
it, 0
that’s 0
their 0
thing, 0
but 0
it 0
ain’t 0
my 0
thing,” 0
he 0
said 0

The 0
term 0
"Jewish 0
Question" 0
is 0
largely 0
used 0
by 0
anti-Semites. 0

So 0
Davis 0
then 0
sorta 0
disavowed 0
his 0
own 0
statements. 0

J 0
Street 0
endorsed 0
him. 0

And 0
then 0
he 0
talked 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
again. 0

Democratic 0
Illinois 0
Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis 0
thinks 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
leader 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan, 0
a 1
notorious 1
racist 1
and 1
anti-Semite, 1
does 0
“outstanding 1
work” 1
but 0
doesn’t 0
agree 0
with 0
Farrakhan’s 0
positions 0
that 0
white 1
people 1
are 1
“devils” 1
and 1
Jewish 1
people 1
are 1
satanic. 1

Progress! 0

"I 1
don’t 1
spend 1
a 1
lot 1
of 1
time, 1
I 1
buy 1
Final 1
Call 1
when 1
I 1
see 1
them. 1

I’ve 1
been 1
to 1
Saviour’s 1
Day, 1
I’ve 1
read, 1
I’ve 1
been 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
Elijah 1
Muhammad, 1
so 1
those 1
are 1
my 1
positions, 1
but 1
I 1
do 1
disagree 1
with 1
the 1
notion 1
that 1
white 1
people 1
are 1
devils.” 1

I 1
wonder 1
how 1
far 1
a 1
white 1
congressman 1
would 1
get 1
saying, 1
"I 1
attended 1
the 1
Klavern, 1
but 1
I 1
don't 1
agree 1
with 1
the 1
KKK's 1
views 1
about 1
black 1
people." 1

But 0
that's 0
Rep. 0
Davis' 0
current 0
views. 0

He 0
likes 0
a 0
racist 0
hate 0
group. 0

But 0
doesn't 0
believe 0
white 0
people 0
are 0
devils 1
or 0
Jews 0
are 0
satanic. 1

Whoever 0
the 0
JTA 0
has 0
on 0
the 0
"explain 0
away 0
Farrakhan's 0
Dem 0
fandom" 0
beat 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
busy 0
again. 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
typical 0
of 0
the 0
Dems 0
and 0
their 0
useful 1
idiots. 1

And 0
J 0
Street 0
is 0
on 0
record 0
as 0
endorsing 0
a 1
politician 1
who 1
praised 1
a 1
racist 1
hate 1
group 1
leader 1
and 1
discussed 1
the 1
"Jewish 1
question." 1

Of 0

the 0
news 0
of 0
the 0
migrant 0

has 0
largely 0
been 0
abandoned 0
due 0

the 0

that 0
doesn't 0

that 0
thousands 0

from 0

abandoned 0
their 0

The 0
case 0
of 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
the 0
police 0
officer 0
who 0
admitted 0
to 0
shooting 0
26-year-old 0
Botham 0

in 0

for 0

a 0
glaring 0
example 0
of 0
“blue 1
privilege” 1
at 0
work 0
in 0
our 1

Guyger 0
claims 0
that 0
she 0
accidentally 0
entered 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment 0
and 0
shot 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
she 0
thought 0
was 0
a 0
burglar, 0
however, 0
eyewitness 0
testimony 0
has 0
contradicted 0
her 0
initial 0
statement. 0

Despite 0
admitting 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
and 0
having 0
her 0
initial 0
statement 0
contradicted 0
by 0
witness 0
testimony, 0
Guyger 0
has 0
been 0
treated 0
as 0
more 0
of 0
a 0
victim 0
than 0
a 0
killer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment 0
was 0
never 0
even 0
searched 0
for 0
evidence, 0
and 0
she 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
“vacate” 0
the 0
premises 0
without 0
any 0
type 0
of 0
search. 0

By 0
not 0

ruined 0
the 0

It 0
would 0

to 0

that 0

the 0

had 0
his 0

immediately. 0

claim 0
to 0
have 0
found 0
a 0
very 0
small 0
amount 0
of 0
marijuana, 0

attempted 0

is 0

in 0

that 0
Guyger 0
is 0
receiving 0
special 0
treatment, 0
not 0
only 0
did 0
she 0

she 0

out 0

that 0
Guyger 0
has 0
been 0
charged 0

manslaughter 0

of 0
murder, 0

Two 0
more 0
women 0
accusing 0
Judge 0

Kavanaugh 0
of 0
dubious 0
improprieties 0
materialized 1
out 1
of 1
thin 1
air 1
late 0
Sunday, 0
throwing 0
Senate 0
Republicans’ 0
hope 0
of 0
finally 0
confirming 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
this 0
week 0
even 0
more 0
into 0
doubt. 0

The 0
new 0
allegations 0
came 0
yesterday 0
amid 0
reports 0
that 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
tentatively 0
scheduled 0
a 0
hearing 0
for 0
this 0
Thursday 0
to 0
take 0
testimony 0
from 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
51, 0
who 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh, 0
53, 0
sexually 0
assaulted 0
her 0
decades 0
ago 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
student. 0

Suspiciously, 1
Ford 1
can’t 1
–or 1
won’t— 1
say 1
when 1
or 1
where 1
the 1
alleged 1
incident 1
happened 1
and 1
can 1
provide 1
few 1
details. 1

As 0
Paul 0
Sperry 0
writes 0
at 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Post, 0
working 0
with 0
Sen. 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
(D-Calif.) 0
and 0
backed 0
financially 0
by 0
George 0
Soros’s 0
money, 0
Ford’s 0
lawyers 0
spent 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
days 0
gaming 1
the 1
system. 1

After 0
stalling 0
Grassley 0
and 0
getting 0
repeated 0
extensions, 0
the 0
attorneys 0
got 0
the 0
chairman 0
to 0
cave 0
on 0
various 0
demands, 0
such 0
as 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
when 0
Ford 0
gives 0
evidence. 0

Republicans 0
never 0
seem 0
to 0
learn 0
from 0
their 0
mistakes. 0

As 0
usual, 0
Republicans’ 0
seeming 0
reasonableness 0
is 0
rewarded 0
with 0
more 0
abuse 0
by 0
the 0
Left. 0

Give 1
left-wingers 1
an 1
inch 1
and 1
they’ll 1
take 1
a 1
mile. 1

Democrats, 0
it 0
turns 0
out, 0
used 0
the 0
extra 0
time 0
created 0
through 0
their 0
delaying 0
tactics 0
to 0
produce 0
two 0
new 0
women 0
with 0
questionable 0
claims 0
against 0
Kavanaugh. 0

More 0
accusers 0
could 0
be 0
on 0
their 0
way. 0

President 0
Trump 0
continues 0
to 0
support 0
Kavanaugh, 0
who 0
maintains 0
his 0
innocence. 0

“This 0
alleged 0
event 0
from 0
35 0
years 0
ago 0
did 0
not 0
happen,” 0
the 0
nominee 0
said 0
Sunday 0
of 0
Ford’s 0
accusations. 0

“The 0
people 0
who 0
knew 0
me 0
then 0
know 0
that 0
this 0
did 0
not 0
happen, 0
and 0
have 0
said 0
so. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
smear, 1
plain 0
and 0
simple. 0

I 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
testifying 0
on 0
Thursday 0
about 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
defending 0
my 0
good 0
name 0
— 0
and 0
the 0
reputation 0
for 0
character 0
and 0
integrity 0
I 0
have 0
spent 0
a 0
lifetime 0
building 0
— 0
against 0
these 0
last-minute 0
allegations.” 0

If 0
Kavanaugh 0
isn’t 0
on 0
the 0
bench 0
on 0
October 0
1, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
will 0
be 0
shorthanded 0
as 0
it 0
begins 0
hearing 0
cases 0
in 0
its 0
new 0
term. 0

The 0
high 0
court 0
normally 0
has 0
a 0
complement 0
of 0
nine 0
justices 0
but 0
with 0
Associate 0
Justice 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy’s 0
retirement 0
July 0
31, 0
which 0
cleared 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
there 0
have 0
only 0
been 0
only 0
eight 0
justices 0
in 0
place. 0

Roughly 0
speaking 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
4-to-4 0
liberal 0
to 0
conservative 0
ideological 0
split 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

Democrats 0
would 0
prefer 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
into 0
the 0
next 0
Congress 0
where 0
they 0
stand 0
a 0
good 0
chance 0
of 0
taking 0
control 0
from 0
Republicans. 0

Election 0
Day 0
is 0
November 0
6. 0

The 0
GOP 0
currently 0
controls 0
the 0
Senate, 0
which 0
has 0
the 0
final 0
say 0
on 0
judicial 0
nominations, 0
by 0
an 0
uncomfortably 0
close 0
margin 0
of 0
51 0
to 0
49. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
New 0
Yorker 0
magazine 0
reported 0
Sunday 0
that 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez, 0
53, 0
suddenly 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
assaulted 0
by 0
Kavanaugh 0
at 0
a 0
drunken 0
party 0
decades 0
ago 0
at 0
Yale 0
College. 0

Ramirez 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
her 0
and 0
brushed 0
his 0
genitals 0
against 0
her. 0

Also 0
on 0
Sunday, 0
media-savvy 1
sleazeball 1
lawyer 1
Michael 0
Avenatti, 0
who 0
represents 0
porn 0
star 0
Stormy 0
Daniels, 0
tweeted 0
that 0
he 0
represents 0
another 0
woman 0
who 0
plans 0
to 0
accuse 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
something. 0

“I 0
represent 0
a 0
woman 0
with 0
credible 0
information 0
regarding 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
Mark 0
Judge. 0

We 0
will 0
be 0
demanding 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
present 0
testimony 0
to 0
the 0
committee 0
and 0
will 0
likewise 0
be 0
demanding 0
that 0
Judge 0
and 0
others 0
be 0
subpoenaed 0
to 0
testify,” 0
Avenatti 0
wrote 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“My 0
client 0
is 0
not 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez.” 0

Washington 0
insiders 0
still 0
believe 0
Kavanaugh 0
will 0
be 0
confirmed, 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
they 0
did 0
before 0
the 0
two 0
new 0
accusers 0
popped 0
up. 0

For 0
example, 0
at 0
a 0
Friday 0
afternoon 0
preview 0
of 0
upcoming 0
cases 0
in 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court’s 0
approaching 0
October 0
term 0
that 0
was 0
hosted 0
by 0
the 0
Federalist 0
Society, 0
panelist 0
Thomas 0
C. 0
Goldstein 0
of 0
the 0
law 0
firm 0
of 0
Goldstein 0
& 0
Russell 0
predicted 0
that 0
the 0
high 0
court 0
would 0
have 0
nine 0
members 0
again 0
soon. 0

“There 0
is 0
exactly 1
a 1
zero 1
percent 1
chance 1
that 0
[Senate 0
Majority 0
Leader] 0
Mitch 0
McConnell 0
and 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
will 0
allow 0
this 0
thing 0
to 0
get 0
past 0
the 1
lame-duck” 1
congressional 0
session 0
after 0
Election 0
Day, 0
said 0
the 0
co-founder 0
of 0
SCOTUSblog 0
who 0
has 0
appeared 0
before 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
many 0
times. 0

“I 0
think 0
we 0
ought 0
to 0
recognize 0
that. 0

The 0
prospect 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats 0
will 0
take 0
the 0
Senate, 0
albeit 0
thin, 0
is 0
realistic, 0
and 0
so 0
they 0
will 0
do 0
whatever 0
is 0
necessary 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
ninth 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
court 0
there 0
by 0
the 0
time 0
a 0
Democratic 0
majority 0
could 0
take 0
over 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
in 0
January.” 0

We’ll 0
see 0
soon 0
enough 0
if 0
Goldstein’s 0
prediction 0
comes 0
true. 0

Questioning 0

The 0
Catholic 0
Twitterverse 0
is 0
alive 0
today 0
with 0
criticism 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB’s 0
decision 0
to 0
sack 0
Fr. 0

Thomas 0
Weinandy, 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
their 0
doctrinal 0
office. 0

It 0
took 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
hours 0
for 0
the 0
brave 1
defenders 1
of 1
the 1
status 1
quo 1
to 0
leap 0
into 0
action 0
against 0
the 0
mild 0
Franciscan 0
friar’s 0
polite 0
plea 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Faith 0
and 0
faithful. 0

Or 0
at 0
least 0
to 0
stop 0
attacking 0
them. 0

In 0
a 0
letter 0
made 0
public 0
November 0
1st, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy, 0
a 0
former 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
for 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Bishops’ 0
Committee 0
on 0
Doctrine 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
International 0
Theological 0
Commission, 0
warned 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
caused 0
“chronic 0
confusion” 0
among 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
bishops. 0

He 0

wrote 0

to 0

the 0
pope, 0
“To 1
teach 1
with 1
such 1
an 1
intentional 1
lack 1
of 1
clarity 1
inevitably 1
risks 1
sinning 1
against 1
the 1
Holy 1
Spirit, 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
truth.” 1
He 0
added 0
that 0
Catholics 0
are 0
“disconcerted” 0
by 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
bishops 0
“who 0
seem 0
not 0
merely 0
open 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
views 0
counter 0
to 0
Christian 0
belief, 0
but 0
who 0
support 0
and 0
even 0
defend 0
them.” 0

In 0

an 0

interview 0

yesterday 0
with 0
John 0
Allen’s 0
Crux, 0
he 0
added, 0
more 0
prophetically 0
than 0
he 0
had 0
perhaps 0
intended, 0
“I 0
don’t 0
think 0
anyone 0
can, 0
or 0
should, 0
associate 0
my 0
letter 0
with 0
the 0
USCCB 0
or 0
the 0
American 0
bishops. 0

Neither 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
my 0
writing 0
the 0
letter, 0
and 0
its 0
publication 0
will 0
be 0
news 0
to 0
them.” 0

“Bishops 0

are 0

quick 0

learners,” 0
he 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
letter, 0
“and 0
what 0
many 0
have 0
learned 0
from 0
your 0
pontificate 0
is 0
not 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
open 0
to 0
criticism, 0
but 0
that 0
you 0
resent 0
it,” 0
claiming 0
that 0
many 0
bishops 0
don’t 1
speak 1
out 1
publicly 1
for 1
fear 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
“marginalized 1
or 1
worse.” 1

And 0

sure 0

enough, 0

within 0
hours 0
of 0
making 0
his 0
letter 0
public, 0
we 0
learned 0
that 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
had 0
been 0
given 1
the 1
boot. 1

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
Twitterverse 0
is 0
busy 0
commenting 0
on 0
the 0
irony: 0
how 0
a 0
man 0
expressing 0
grave 0
concerns 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
of 0
fear 0
of 0
being 0
punished 0
for 0
expressing 0
grave 0
concerns, 0
was 0
immediately 0
fired. 0

Perhaps 0

the 0

most 0

astonishing 0
aspect 0
of 0
this 0
little 1
incident 1
is 0
just 0
how 0
completely 0
blind 0
the 0
US 0
bishops 0
– 0
as 0
with 0
nearly 0
all 0
the 0
episcopate 0
– 0
are 0
to 0
what 0
political 0
analysts 0
call 0
the 0
“optics”. 0

Political 0
consultants 0
often 0
ask: 0
how 0
does 0
it 0
look? 0

And 0
it 0
looks 0
extremely 1
bad. 1

As 0
though 0
the 0
fog 0
of 0
irony 0
weren’t 0
thick 0
enough, 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
outrage 0
from 0
Catholics, 0
the 0
USCCB 0
has 0
done 0
what 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
cabal 0
have 0
done 0
and 0
started 0
blocking 0
critics 0
from 0
its 0
Twitter 0
account. 0

Which, 0
it 0
must 0
be 0
said, 0
only 0
proves 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
point 0
once 0
again. 0

Some 0

of 0

the 0

criticism 0
has 0
been 0
unusually 0
sharp. 0

Fr. 0

Hunwicke 0
wrote 0
this 0
afternoon, 0
“This 0
cheap 1
and 1
vulgar 1
ritual 1
humiliation 1
exemplifies 0
the 0
extent 0
to 0
which 0
P[ope] 0
F[rancis] 0
is 0
presiding 0
over 0
a 0
bully-boy 1
Church 1
in 0
which 0
midget 1
bishops 1
and 1
minicardinals 1
compete 0
to 0
defeat 0
each 0
other 0
in 0
the 0
sycophancy 0
stakes. 0

Just 0
as 0
Tom 0
Weinandy 0
has, 0
in 0
effect, 0
just 0
said.” 0

As 0

I 0

write 0

this, 0
the 0
outrage 0
is 0
doing 0
the 0
opposite 0
of 0
dying 0
down, 0
and 0
is 0
surely 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
how 0
fed 0
up 0
Catholics 0
– 0
even 0
those 0
who 0
would 0
never 0
identify 0
themselves 0
as 0
Traditionalists 0
– 0
have 0
become 0
with 0
this 0
pope 0
and 0
his 0
cadre 0
of 0
episcopal 1
bullies. 1

In 0
his 0
letter, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
made 0
a 0
point 0
of 0
stating 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
signatory 0
to 0
the 0
Filial 0
Correction 0
or 0
any 0
other 0
public 0
declaration 0
against 0
Pope 0

In 0

fact, 0

a 0

former 0
student 0
of 0
his 0
wrote 0
to 0
me 0
today 0
saying, 0

“I 0
see 0
that 0
Fr. 0

He 0
was 0

could 0
have 0
hoped 0
to 0
meet. 0

To 0
me, 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
chosen 0
to 0
write 0
to 0
express 0
his 0
concern 0
about 0
the 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
papacy 0
is 0
very 0
significant. 0

He 0

is 0
neither 0
a 0
traditionalist, 0
nor 0
a 0
controversialist, 0
but 0
a 0
humble 0
and 0
straightforward 0
Friar 0
who 0
is 0
clear-thinking 0
and 0
entirely 0
loyal 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
Her 0
teaching. 0

I 0
would 0
be 0
surprised 0
now 0
if 0
we 0
were 0
not 0
see 0
more 0
of 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
letter/exercise 0
of 0
conscience. 0

I 0
imagine 0
that 0
it’s 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
harder 0
and 0
harder 0
for 0
men 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
position 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
fence.” 0

When 0
I 0
posted 0
it, 0
this 0
assessment 0
was 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
Joseph 0
Shaw, 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
UK’s 0
Latin 0
Mass 0
Society 0
and 0
the 0
spokesman 0
for 0
the 0
Filial 0
Correction, 0
who 0
wrote, 0
“This 0
is 0
absolutely 0
right. 0

Not 0
a 0
man 0
to 0
seek 0
out 0
confrontation.” 0

The 0

Crux 0
piece 0
offered 0
a 0
succinct 0
bullet 0
point 0
list 0
of 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
concerns. 0

He 0
said 0
the 0
pope 0
is… 0

Fostering 0
“chronic 0
confusion.” 0

“Demeaning” 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
doctrine. 0

Appointing 0
bishops 0
who 1
“scandalize” 1
believers 1
with 0
dubious 0
“teaching 0
and 0
pastoral 0
practice.” 0

Giving 0
prelates 0
who 0
object 0
the 0
impression 0
they’ll 1
be 1
“marginalized 1
or 1
worse” 1
if 1
they 1
speak 1
out. 1

Causing 0
faithful 0
Catholics 0
to 0
“lose 0
confidence 0
in 0
their 0
supreme 1
shepherd.” 1

Our 0
friend 0
Edward 0
Pentin 0
has 0
reproduced 0
the 0
full 0
text 0
of 0
the 0
letter 0
at 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register 0
which 0
is 0
definitely 0
worth 0
a 0
read. 0

Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
sent 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
on 0
July 0
31, 0
the 0
Feast 0
of 0
St. 0
Ignatius 0
of 0
Loyola. 0

Like 0
the 0
Dubia 0
cardinals, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
made 0
it 0
public 0
only 0
after 0
the 0
pope 0
had 0
ignored 0
it 0
for 0
months. 0

Notable 0

in 0
his 0
critique 0
is 0
its 0
distinct 0
pastoral 0
flavour, 0
his 0
concern 0
on 0
the 0
effect 0
the 0
situation 0
is 0
having 0
on 0
ordinary 0
people. 0

The 0
pope, 0
he 0
said, 0
seems 0
“to 0
censor 0
and 0
even 0
mock” 0
critics 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
for 0
their 0
desire 0
to 0
interpret 0
it 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
Catholic 0
teaching, 0
and 0
in 0
doing 0
so 0
is 0
committing 0
a 0
“kind 0
of 0
calumny…alien 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
Petrine 0
ministry.” 0

In 0

an 0
interview 0
with 0
Crux, 0
Weinandy 0
said 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
afraid 0
of 0
reprisals 0
but 0
“more 0
concerned 0
about 0
the 0
good 0
that 0
my 0
letter 0
might 0
do.” 0
The 0
letter 0
“expresses 0
the 0
concerns 0
of 0
many 0
more 0
people 0
than 0
just 0
me, 0
ordinary 0
people 0
who’ve 0
come 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
their 0
questions 0
and 0
apprehensions. 0

I 0
wanted 0
them 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
I 0
listened.” 0

“I 0

have 1
done 1
what 1
I 1
believe 1
God 1
wanted 1
me 1
to 1
do,[1]” 1
he 0
said. 0

In 0

fact, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
has 0
bolstered 1
my 1
own 1
“Great 1
Clarifier” 1
theory, 1
saying 0
that 0
this 0
pontificate, 0
and 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
response 0
to 0
it 0
from 0
priests 0
and 0
bishops, 0
is 0
being 0
allowed 0
by 0
God 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
reveal 0
“just 0
how 0
weak 0
is 0
the 0
faith 0
of 0
many 0
within 0
the 0
Church,” 0
He 0
added 0
that 0
Francis 0
has 0
revealed 0
that 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
“hold 0
harmful 0
theological 0
and 0
pastoral 0
views.” 0

Which 0

inevitably 0
brings 0
to 0
mind 0
other 0
responses 0
that 0
have 0
not 0
been 0
quite 0
so 0
clear, 0
nor 0
so 0
pastoral. 0

When 0

Cardinal 0
Muller 0
was 0
removed 0
abruptly 0
from 0
his 0
position 0
as 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CDF, 0
the 0
conservative 0
Catholic 0
world 0
wailed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
another 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
“good” 0
prelate 0
being 0
got 0
rid 0
of. 0

And 0
it 0
seems 0
clear 0
from 0
the 0
way 0
it 0
was 0
done, 0
and 0
the 0
way 0
Francis 0
treated 0
Muller 0
in 0
general, 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
indeed 0
got 1
rid 1
of. 1

But 0
his 0
depiction 0
by 0
conservative 0
writers 0
as 0
a 0
beleaguered 0
champion 0
of 0
Catholic 0
orthodoxy 0
persecuted 0
by 0
the 0
regime 0
for 0
his 0
faithfulness 0
betrays 0
a 0
somewhat 0
selective 0
memory 0
and 0
short 0
attention 0
span. 0

Ed 0
Pentin 0
has 0
a 0
long 0
file 0
of 0
interviews 0
and 0
articles 0
about 0
Muller 0
that 0
clearly 0
show 0
his 0
complete 0
inability 0
to 0
make 0
up 0
his 0
mind 0
whose 0
side 0
he’s 0
on. 0

A 0

quick 0
examination 0
of 0
Muller’s 0
interviews 0
and 0
statements 0
reveal 0
an 0
irresolute 0
and 0
ultimately 0
calculating 0
mind 0
of 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
is 0
– 0
so 0
I 0
am 0
told 0
by 0
sources 0
close 0
to 0
him 0
– 0
motivated 0
mainly 0
by 0
a 0
puerile 0
desire 0
to 0
be 0
approved 0
of 0
by 0
the 1
“cool 1
kids” 1
in 1
the 1
Vatican, 1
on 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
and 0
an 0
unshakeable 0
conviction 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
theological 0
brilliance 0
on 0
the 0
other. 0

Most 0

recently, 0
on 0
October 0
30th, 0
Crux 0
quoted 0
him 0
under 0
the 0
headline, 0
“Cardinal 0
Muller 0
backs 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
against 0
critics 0
of 0
‘Amoris 0
Laetitia’” 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CDF 0
has 0
at 0
last 0
climbed 0
on 0
board 0
the 0
Kasperian 0
train 0
on 0
reception 0
of 0
Communion 0
for 0
unrepentant 0
adulterers. 0

Signaling 1

furiously 1
with 0
the 0
trendy 0
FrancisChurch 0
buzzwords 0
and 0
even 0
trendier 0
blithering 1
incoherence, 1
Muller 0
writes 0
that 0
“mitigating 0
factors 0
in 0
guilt,” 0
can 0
lead, 0
couples 0
in 0
“an 0
uncertain 0
marital 0
situation” 0
through 0
a 0
“path 0
of 0
repentance” 0
– 0
always 0
“accompanied” 0
by 0
an 0
exquisitely 0
sensitive 0
confessor 0
– 0
to 0
a 0
point 0
where 0
the 0
reception 0
of 0
Communion 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
sinful. 0

Presumably 1
because 1
adultery 1
itself 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
sinful. 1

Or 0
sacrilege 0
either, 0
I 0
guess. 0

Or 0
something. 0

Somehow 0
the 0
“new 0
evangelization” 0
is 0
involved 0
in 0
this, 0
though 0
it’s 0
unclear 0
how 0
exactly 0
it 0
makes 0
adultery 0
and 0
sacrilege 0
OK. 0
Also, 0
it’s 0
very 0
important 0
to 0
fulfill 0
the 0
Sunday 0
Mass 0
obligation, 0
and 0
as 0
everyone 0
knows, 0
one 0
can’t 0
possibly 0
go 0
to 0
Mass 0
on 0
a 0
Sunday 0
without 0
receiving 0
Communion. 0

We 0

hear 0
again, 0
as 0
we 0
did 0
incessantly 0
from 0
the 0
Kasperians 0
at 0
the 0
Synods, 0
about 0
the 0
hard 0
case 0
of 0
the 1
poor, 1
poor 1
woman 1
who 0
has 0
been 0
abandoned 0
by 0
the 0
first 0
husband, 0
and 0
who 0
“finds 0
no 0
other 0
way 0
out 0
than 0
to 0
entrust 0
oneself 0
to 0
a 0
kind-hearted 0
person,” 0
… 0
with 1
whom, 1
I 1
guess, 1
she 1
has 1
also 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
have 1
sexual 1
relations. 1

Because 1
of 1
kind-heartedness. 1

Anyway, 0

the 0
result 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
“marriage-like 0
relationship” 0
about 0
which 0
confessors 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
careful 0
not 0
to 0
say 0
mean 0
things. 0

Or 0
be 0
too 0
“extreme”. 0

It’s 0
very 0
important 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
avoid 0
a 0
“cheap 0
adaptation 0
to 0
the 0
relativistic 1
Zeitgeist,” 1
on 0
one 0
side, 0
and 0
a 0
“cold 0
application 0
of 0
the 0
dogmatic 0
commandments 0
and 0
the 0
canonical 0
rules,” 0
on 0
the 0
other. 0

Because 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
too 0
polarizing. 0

And 0
mean. 0

And 0

anyway, 0
sins 0
of 0
the 0
flesh 0
aren’t 0
the 0
worst 0
things 0
ever. 0

There 0
are, 0
like, 0
“different 0
levels” 0
of 0
gravity, 0
you 0
know? 0

And, 0
like, 0
it 0
depends 0
on 0
the 0
type 0
of 0
sin, 0
right? 0

“Spirit’s 0
sins” 0
like 0
spiritual 0
pride 0
and 0
avarice 0
and 0
stuff, 0
are 0
worse 0
than 0
“sins 0
of 0
the 0
flesh,” 0
you 0
know? 0

Which 0
are, 0
like, 0
only 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“human 0
weakness,” 0
right? 0

Apparently 0

the 0
real 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
whole 0
thing 0
has 0
been 0
that 0
the 0
Kasperian 0
kerfuffle 0
has 0
totally 0
been 0
blown 0
way, 0
way, 0
WAY 0
out 0
of 0
proportion, 0
and 0
the 0
“polarization” 0
it 0
has 0
caused 0
has 0
been 0
“regrettable”. 0

The 0
question 0
of 0
Communion 0
for 0
divorced 0
and 0
civilly 0
“remarried” 0
Catholics, 0
he 0
said, 0
has 0
been 0
“falsely 1
elevated 1
to 1
the 1
rank 1
of 1
a 1
decisive 1
question 1
of 1
Catholicism 1
and 1
a 1
measure 1
of 1
ideological 1
comparison 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
decide 1
whether 1
one 1
is 1
conservative 1
or 1
liberal, 1
in 1
favor 1
or 1
against 1
the 1
pope.” 1

For 0

years 0
under 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
Muller 0
was 0
engaged 0
in 0
an 0
open 0
war 0
with 0
the 0
German 0
episcopate 0
who 0
insisted 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
allow 0
Communion 0
for 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried, 0
no 0
matter 0
what 0
Rome 0
said, 0
even 1
threatening 1
to 1
go 1
into 1
schism 1
if 1
they 1
didn’t 1
get 1
their 1
way[2]. 0

Muller, 0

with 0
little 0
backing 0
from 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
– 0
who 0
appeared 0
content 0
to 0
allow 0
his 0
CDF 0
prefect 0
and 0
the 0
Germans 0
shout 0
out 0
their 0
differences 0
– 0
and 0
with 0
outright 0
opposition 0
from 0
Francis, 0
did 0
indeed 0
strive 0
to 0
hold 0
the 0
line. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
Francis 0
orchestrated 0
the 0
Synods 0
to 0
undermine 0
him 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
his 0
fault. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
difficult 0
to 0
imagine 0
anyone 0
being 0
in 0
a 0
worse 0
position 0
than 0
he 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

But 0

since 0
then, 0
Muller 0
has 0
demonstrated 0
very 0
little 0
of 0
his 0
former 0
grit, 0
instead 0
attempting 0
from 0
one 0
day 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
to 0
appease 0
both 0
sides. 0

Reportedly 0
removed 0
from 0
CDF 0
– 0
and 0
of 0
course 0
lionized 1
by 0
“conservatives” 0
– 0
for 0
his 0
mild 0
and 0
equivocating 0
opposition 0
to 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia, 0
Muller 0
has 0
gone 0
back 0
and 0
forth 0
in 0
what 0
can 0
easily 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
a 0
desperate 0
attempt 0
to 0
find 0
friends 0
in 0
both 0
camps. 0

With 0
this 0
in 0
mind 0
one 0
could 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
not 0
taking 0
his 0
October 0
30th 0
essay 0
too 0
seriously. 0

Perhaps 0

one 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
effects 0
to 0
come 0
from 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy’s 0
persecution 0
will 0
be 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
how 0
a 0
pastor 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
act. 0

As 0
my 0
friend 0
said, 0
maybe 0
“it’s 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
harder 0
and 0
harder 0
for 0
men 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
position 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
fence,” 0
assuming 0
there 0
are 0
any 0
left. 0

In 0
this 0
interview, 0
Fr. 0

Weinandy 0
gave 0
a 0
remarkable 0
story 0
of 0
how 0
his 0
prayer 0
for 0
a 0
“sign” 0
that 0
he 0
ought 0
to 0
write 0
the 0
letter 0
was 0
very 0
specifically 0
answered: 0
“If 0
you 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
something, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
give 0
me 0
a 0
clear 0
sign,” 0
Weinandy 0
recalls 0
saying. 0

“Tomorrow 0
morning, 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
Saint 0
Mary 0
Major’s 0
to 0
pray, 0
and 0
then 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
Saint 0
John 0
Lateran. 0

After 0
that, 0
I’m 0
coming 0
back 0
to 0
Saint 0
Peter’s 0
to 0
have 0
lunch 0
with 0
a 0
seminary 0
friend 0
of 0
mine.” 0
“During 0
that 0
interval, 0
I 0
must 0
meet 0
someone 0
that 0
I 0
know 0
but 0
have 0
not 0
seen 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time, 0
and 0
would 0
never 0
expect 0
to 0
see 0
in 0
Rome 0
at 0
this 0
time. 0

That 0
person 0
cannot 0
be 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Canada 0
or 0
Great 0
Britain. 0

Moreover, 0
that 0
person 0
has 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
me, 0
‘Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing’.” 0
Weinandy 0
said, 0
exactly 0
that 0
happened 0
the 0
next 0
day, 0
in 0
a 0
chance 0
meeting 0
with 0
an 0
archbishop 0
he’d 0
known 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago 0
but 0
not 0
seen 0
for 0
over 0
twenty 0
years, 0
who 0
congratulated 0
him 0
for 0
a 0
book 0
on 0
the 0
Incarnation 0
and 0
then 0
said 0
the 0
right 0
words, 0
“Keep 0
up 0
the 0
good 0
writing.” 0
“There 0
was 0
no 0
longer 0
any 0
doubt 0
in 0
my 0
mind 0
that 0
Jesus 0
wanted 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
something,” 0
Weinandy 0
said. 0

[2] 0
It’s 0
notable 0
that 0
these 0
howling 1
tantrums 1
from 0
the 0
German 0
bishops 0

said 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
sure 0
if 0
someone 0
from 0
his 0
office 0
had 0
told 0
the 0
ADL 0
he 0
was 0
misquoted, 0
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
News 0
Foundation 0
on 0
Sunday. 0

“I 0
think 0
that 0
was 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
to 0
write. 0

Nah, 0
I 0
don’t 0
have 0
no 0
problems 0
with 0
Farrakhan, 0
I 0
don’t 0
spend 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
my 0
time 0
dealing 0
with 0
those 0
kind 0
of 0

said. 0

“That’s 0
just 0
one 0
segment 0
of 0
what 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
our 0
world. 0

The 1
world 1
is 1
so 1
much 1
bigger 1
than 1
Farrakhan 1
and 1
the 1
Jewish 1
question 1
and 1
his 1
position 1
on 1
that 1
and 1
so 1
forth. 1

For 0
those 0
heavy 0
into 0
it, 0
that’s 0
their 0
thing, 0
but 0
it 0
ain’t 0
my 0

he 0
said 0

The 1
people 1
who 1
talk 1
about 1
the 1
"Jewish 1
question" 1
are 1
generally 1
anti-Semites. 1

Somehow 0
I 0
don't 0
think 0
a 0
white 0
congressman 0
would 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
saying 0
that 0
he 0
agrees 0
with 0
David 0
Duke 0
on 0
the 0
environment 0
but 0
isn't 0
especially 0
concerned 0
about 0
his 0
racism. 0

But 0
black 0
leaders 0
have 0
gotten 0
away 0
with 0
playing 0
that 0
game 0
with 0
Farrakhan 0
repeatedly. 0

But 0
the 0
ADL 0
and 0
the 0
JTA 0
will 0
whitewash 1
this 0
again. 0

And 1
if 1
they 1
can't 1
whitewash 1
this, 1
they'll 1
ignore 1
it. 1

That’s 0
right, 0
photographic 0
evidence 0
from 0
inside 0
the 0
hotel 0
parking 0

has 0
confirmed 0
that 0
the 0

state 0
and 0
local 0
police, 0
specifically 0
lied 0
about 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
shooting. 0

This 1
throws 1
their 1
entire 1
narrative 1
into 1
question 1
and 1
makes 1
one 1
wonder 1
what 1
else 1
is 1
being 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
public? 1

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
four 0
videos 0
from 0
the 0
scene 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
have 0
already 0
been 0
released 0
that 0
indicate 0
there 0
were 0
multiple 0
shooters. 0

In 0
fact, 0
there 0
are 0
so 0
many 0
unanswered 0
questions 0
that 0
the 0
Drudge 0

even 0
linked 0

an 0

asking 0
them 0
directly. 0

As 0
noted 0

at 0
this 0
point 0
literally 0
every 0
piece 0
of 0
so-called 1
evidence 1
put 0
forth 0
by 0
authorities 0
and 0
then 0
regurgitated 0
by 0
the 0
mainstream 0

cannot 1
be 1
trusted 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
considered 1
as 1
disinformation 1
until 0
proven 0
otherwise. 0

And 0
if 0
Paddock 0
really 0
did 0
act 0
alone 0
and 0
this 0
evidence 0
is 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0

there 0

At 0

University 0

​Despite 0
suffering 0
several 0

those 0

(BDS) 0
against 0

their 0
pernicious 1
campaign 1
of 1
hate. 1

The 0
latest 0
outrage 1
perpetrated 0
by 0
BDS 0
activists 0
occurred 0
at 0
McGill 0
University, 0
where 0
a 0
Jewish 0
student 0
and 0
two 0
non-Jewish 0
students 0
identified 0
as 0
pro-Israel 0
were 0
removed 0
from 0
their 0
positions 0
as 0
directors 0
of 0
the 0
Students 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
(SSMU). 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
his 0
second 0
year, 0
Noah 0
Lew, 0
who 0
is 0
currently 0
third 0
year 0
undergraduate 0
student 0
at 0
McGill 0
University, 0
applied 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
School’s 0
student 0
society. 0

He 1
was 1
warned 1
by 1
others 1
who 1
had 1
prior 1
dealings 1
with 1
the 1
SSMU, 1
to 1
keep 1
his 1
Jewish 1
identity 1
secret 1
lest 1
he 1
sabotage 1
his 1
chances. 1

This 0
is 0
the 0
atmosphere 0
that 0
Jewish 0
students 0
and 0
supporters 0
of 0
Israel 0
must 0
endure 0
on 0
a 0
daily 0
basis 0
at 0
McGill. 0

The 1
toxic 1
environment 1
is 0
due 0
almost 0
exclusively 0
to 0
an 0
active 0
and 0
vocal 0
presence 0
of 0
BDS 1
agitators 1
on 0
campus. 0

Lew 0
followed 0
the 0
advice 0
and 0
was 0
elected 0
as 0
a 0
board 0
member. 0

His 0
“secret” 0
was 0
intact. 0

BDS 1
provocateurs 1
at 0
McGill 0
had 0
relentlessly 0
tried 0
and 0
failed 0
to 0
pass 0
boycott 0
resolutions 0
against 0
Israel. 0

In 0
fact, 0
three 0
attempts 0
within 0
an 0
18-month 0
period 0
were 1
quashed. 1

Finally, 0
in 0
June 0
2016, 0
SSMU’s 0
Judicial 0
Board 0
ruled 0
that 0
the 0
BDS 0
campaign 0
and 0
efforts 0
to 0
institute 0
it 0
at 0
McGill 0
ran 0
counter 0
to 0
the 0
McGill’s 0
undergraduate 0
student 0
union 0
constitution. 0

The 0
Board’s 0
ruling, 0
which 0
is 0
called 0
a 0
“reference,” 0
was 0
then 0
referred 0
to 0
SSMU’s 0
directors 0
for 0
ratification. 0

SSMU’s 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
addressed 0
the 0
issue 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
after 0
the 0
“reference.” 0
Lew 0
and 0
other 0
board 0
members 0
passionately 1
advocated 1
in 0
favor 0
of 0
ratification 0
and 0
their 0
arguments 0
ultimately 0
prevailed 0
over 0
the 0
naysayers. 0

The 1
malevolent 1
BDS 1
campaign 1
at 0
McGill 0
had 0
belatedly 0
come 0
to 0
an 0
ignominious 1
end; 1
or 0
so 0
we 0
thought. 0

Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
directors 0
identified 0
as 0
either 0
Jewish 0
or 0
pro-Israel 0
became 0
instant 0
targets 0
of 0
a 1
campaign 1
of 1
hate 1
laced 1
with 1
blatant 1
anti-Semitic 1
overtones. 1

Campus 0
BDS 0
groups 0
held 0
several 0
meetings 0
to 0
formulate 0
a 0
response 0
and 0
founded 0
the 0
so-called 0
“Democratize 0
SSMU” 0
movement. 0

But 1
Democratize 1
SSMU 1
was 1
anything 1
but 1
democratic. 1

Its 0
raison 0
d'être 0
was 0
to 0
seek 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0
Jewish 0
and 0
anti-BDS 0
students 0
from 0
SSMU’s 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
and 0
place 0
BDS 0
back 0
on 0
the 0
agenda. 0

As 0
an 0
aside, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
more 0
vocal 0
proponents 0
of 0
BDS 0
at 0
McGill 0
is 0
a 0
rancid 0
character 0
named 0
Igor 0
Sadikov, 0
who 0
in 0
February 0
posted 0
a 0
comment 0
on 0
twitter 0
advocating 0
violence 0
against 0
“Zionists.” 0
As 0
a 0
result, 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
resign 0
his 0
position 0
as 0
an 0
SSMU 0
director 0
but 0
dodged 0
an 0
impeachment 0
effort 0
to 0
have 0
him 0
stripped 0
of 0
his 0
position 0
at 0
McGill’s 0
Arts 0
Undergraduate 0
Society. 0

Sadikov 0
made 0
light 0
of 0
his 0
“punch 1
a 1
Zionist” 1
tweet 0
calling 0
it 0
a 0
“misguided 1
joke.” 1
It 0
does 0
not 0
appear 0
that 0
Sadikov 0
was 0
subjected 0
to 0
any 0
form 0
of 0
school 0
disciplinary 0
action 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
his 0
call 0
for 0
violence 0
violated 0
McGill’s 0
Code 0
of 0
Conduct. 0

McGill’s 0
BDS 0
Action 0
Network 0
actively 0
campaigned 0
against 0
Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
board 0
members 0
because 0
of 0
their 0
links 0
to 0
Jewish 0
groups 0
and 0
anti-BDS 0
stances. 0

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
shamefully 1
highlighted 0
Lew’s 0
ethnicity 0
as 0
a 0
reason 0
for 0
his 0
removal. 0

An 1
enlightened, 1
progressive 1
school 1
was 1
suddenly 1
transformed 1
into 1
something 1
harking 1
back 1
to 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
Nazi 1
Germany 1
and 1
the 1
Nuremberg 1
Laws. 1

In 0
October, 0
SSMU’s 0
General 0
Assembly 0
moved 0
to 0
ratify 0
the 0
12-member 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors. 0

According 0
to 0
Lew, 0
“historically, 0
the 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
had 0
been 0
ratified 0
as 0
a 0
bloc, 0
all 0
12 0
at 0
a 0
time.” 0
But 0
BDS 0
activists 0
who 0
showed 0
up 0
for 0
the 0
General 0
Assembly 0
ratification 0
forced 0
the 0
voting 0
to 0
occur 0
on 0
an 0
individual 0
basis 0
rather 0
than 0
a 0
block 0
as 0
was 0
the 0
accepted 0
protocol. 0

In 0
this 0
manner, 0
BDS/ 0
Democratize 0
SSMU 0
activists 0
managed 0
to 0
pick 0
off 0
their 0
opponents 0
one 0
at 0
a 0
time. 0

It 0
was 0
repulsive 1
display 1
leftist-fascist 1
bigotry 1
at 1
its 1
worst. 1

The 1
bigoted 1
BDS 1
provocateurs 1
applauded 0
as 0
Lew 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
two 0
board 0
members 0
were 0
removed 0
from 0
their 0
posts. 0

But 0
this 0
time, 0
they 0
may 0
have 0
gone 0
too 0
far. 0

Even 0
by 0
BDS 0
standards, 0
their 1
manifestly 1
anti-Semitic 1
campaign 1
antics 1
were 1
beyond 1
the 1
pale. 1

BDS 0
activists 0
generally 0
avoid 0
reference 0
to 0
“Jews” 0
by 0
name 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
impolitic 0
and 0
commonly 0
substitute 0
“Zionists” 0
for 0
Jews 0
even 0
though 0
most 0
of 0
us 0
are 0
cognizant 0
of 0
their 0
true 0
intentions. 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
instant 0
case, 0
McGill’s 0
BDS 0
campaigners 0
dispensed 0
with 0
their 0
traditional 0
charade 1
and 0
overtly 0
launched 0
their 0
attack 0
against 0
Jews. 0

The 1
vitriolic 1
BDS 1
campaign 1
immediately 0
sparked 1
outrage 1
among 0
watchdog 0
groups 0
and 0
politicians 0
prompting 0
McGill 0
principal, 0
Suzanne 0
Fortier, 0
to 0
announce 0
that 0
the 0
school 0
would 0
be 0
conducting 0
an 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
matter. 0

Even 0
SSMU 0
president, 0
Muna 0
Tojiboeva, 0
voiced 0
support 0
for 0
Lew 0
and 0
expressed 0
the 0
belief 0
that 0
antisemitism 0
played 0
a 0
key 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
ousting 0
the 0
three 0
board 0
members. 0

One 0
can 0
only 0
hope 0
that 0
Fortier 0
takes 0
the 0
issue 0
seriously 0
and 0
conducts 0
a 0
proper 0
investigation, 0
which 0
leads 0
to 0
disciplinary 0
action. 0

that 0
the 0
officer 0
arrived 0
home 0
in 0
full 0
uniform 0
after 0
working 0
a 0
full 0

that 0

believing 0
that 0

At 0
some 0
point, 0
the 0
officer 0
fired 0
her 0
weapon 0
striking 0
the 0
victim. 0

Responding 0
officers 0
administered 0
aid 0
to 0
the 0
victim, 0
a 0
26-year-old 0
male, 0
at 0
the 0
scene. 0

The 0

transported 0

Next 0
of 0
kin 0

The 0

not 0
injured 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
placed 0
on 0
administrative 0
leave 0
pending 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
investigation. 0

The 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
is 0
conducting 0
a 0
joint 0
investigation 0
with 0
the 0
District 0
Attorney’s 0
Office. 0

This 0
investigation 0
is 0
ongoing 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
release 0
additional 0
details 0
as 0
they 0
become 0
available 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
appropriate 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

If 0
an 0
average 0
citizen 0
walked 0
into 0
the 0
wrong 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
and 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
homeowner, 0
rest 0

now. 0

However, 0
instead 0
of 0
immediately 0
arresting 0
the 0
officer 0
for 0
trespassing 0
and 0
murder, 0
she 0
was 0
simply 0
placed 0
on 0

leave—a 0
glaring 1
function 0
of 0
blue 1
privilege 1
indeed. 0

“Super 1
scary 1
because 0
the 0
police 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0

you 0

Jean’s 0
mother 0
in 0
a 0
phone 0
interview 0
from 0
her 0
home 0
in 0
St. 0
Lucia 0
who 0
was 0
stunned 0
to 0
hear 0
of 0
his 0
death. 0

“He 0
did 0
no 0
one 0
any 0
wrong,” 0
she 0
said. 0

While 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
consistently 0
reports 0
on 0
police 0
officers 0
entering 0
the 0
wrong 0
home 0
during 0
raids 0
and 0
killing, 0
maiming, 1
or 0
traumatizing 1
entirely 1
innocent 1
people, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
we’ve 0
reported 0
a 0
story 0
of 0
an 0
off-duty 0
cop 0
going 0
into 0
the 0
wrong 0
home, 0
on 0
their 0
way 0
home, 0
and 0
killing 0
someone. 0

The 0
details 0
of 0
how 0
or 0
why 0
this 0
officer 0
would 0
walk 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
that 0
was 0
not 0
hers 0
are 0
unclear. 0

However, 0
what 0
is 0
entirely 0
clear 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
a 0
mother 0
and 0
father 0
are 0
now 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
grieving 0
for 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
their 0
lives 0
because 0
of 0
her 0
actions. 0

And, 0
in 0
a 0
slap 0
to 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
parents, 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
their 0
innocent 1
son 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
arrested. 0

from 0

time 0
at 0

accused 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
of 0
exposing 0
himself 0
to 0
her 0
at 0
a 0
party. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
has 0
just 0
published 0
an 0
article 0
written 0
by 0
Ronan 0
Farrow 0
and 0
Jane 0
Mayer, 0
based 0
on 0
information 0
that 0
was 0
reportedly 0
sent 0
to 0
at 0
least 0
four 0
Democratic 0
senators. 0

The 0
article 0
recounted 0
a 0
claim 0
by 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez, 0
a 0
Yale 0
classmate 0
of 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s, 0
concerning 0
“a 0
dormitory 0
party 0
gone 0
awry.” 0
As 0
the 0
article 0
acknowledged, 0
however, 0
“her 0
memories 0
contained 0
gaps 0
because 0
she 0
had 0
been 0
drinking 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident.” 0
The 0
article 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
in 0
her 0
initial 0
conversations 0
with 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker, 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez 0
was 0
“reluctant 0
to 0
characterize 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
with 0
certainty.” 0
It 0
was 0
only 0
after 0
“six 0
days 0
of 0
carefully 0
assessing 0
her 0
memories 0
and 0
consulting 0
with 0
her 0
attorney” 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez 0
was 0
suddenly 0
able 0
to 0
pinpoint 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
having 0
committed 0
an 0
unsavory 0
act, 0
even 0
though 0
she 0
admitted 0
being 0
“foggy” 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
article 0
also 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
magazine 0
“has 0
not 0
confirmed 0
with 0
other 0
eyewitnesses 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
present 0
at 0
the 0
party.” 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
ever-present 0
Michael 0
Avenatti, 0
attorney 0
of 0
porn 0
star 0
Stormy 0
Daniels, 0
tweeted 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
information 0
from 0
anonymous 0
sources 0
that 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
his 0
friend 0
had 0
"targeted" 0
women 0
with 0
drugs 0
and 0
alcohol 0
at 0
parties 0
to 0
facilitate 0
"gang 0
rape." 0

Haters 1
of 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh 1
are 0
turning 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
Senate 0
confirmation 0
of 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
into 0
something 0
worse 1
than 1
a 1
travesty. 1

His 0
opponents 0
in 0
the 0
Senate 0
have 0
transformed 0
their 0
“advise 0
and 0
consent” 0
function 0
into 0
a 0
campaign 0
of 0
no-holds 0
barred 0
character 1
assassination. 1

While 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
weathers 0
these 0
latest 0
accusations, 0
which 0
he 0
adamantly 0
denies, 0
his 0
real 0
test 0
will 0
be 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
assuming 0
that 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
will 0
follow 0
through 0
on 0
her 0
agreement 0
to 0
testify 0
at 0
an 0
open 0
hearing 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee. 0

Her 0
attorneys 0
stalled 0
for 0
a 0
week 0
before 0
making 0
the 0
announcement 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
would 0
testify 0
despite 0
certain 0
“unresolved” 0
issues. 0

Among 0
the 0
issues 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
attorneys 0
have 0
raised 0
was 0
the 0
refusal 0
of 0
the 0
committee 0
to 0
subpoena 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
purported 0
witnesses, 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
who 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
reportedly 0
claims 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
“who 0
on 0
the 0
Majority 0
side 0
will 0
be 0
asking 0
the 0
questions, 0
whether 0
senators 0
or 0
staff 0
attorneys." 0

A 0
week 0
has 0
already 0
gone 0
by 0
since 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
went 0
public 0
with 0
her 0
story 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
while 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
and 0
her 0
attorneys 0
stalled 0
for 0
time. 0

They 0
raised 0
one 0
procedural 0
issue 0
after 0
another 0
while 0
claiming 0
that 0
the 0
committee 0
majority 0
was 0
“bullying” 0
Ms. 0
Ford. 0

Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Chairman 0
Charles 0
Grassley 0
(R-I) 0
has 0
bent 1
over 1
backwards 1
to 0
accommodate 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
preferred 0
scheduling 0
for 0
her 0
appearance. 0

He 0
extended 0
the 0
deadline 0
several 0
times 0
for 0
her 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
a 0
decision 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
testify 0
at 0
all. 0

He 0
had 0
offered 0
various 0
options 0
for 0
her 0
to 0
testify 0
publicly 0
or 0
privately 0
or 0
to 0
be 0
interviewed 0
by 0
committee 0
staff 0
in 0
her 0
home 0
state 0
of 0
California, 0
whichever 0
setting 0
would 0
make 0
her 0
more 0
comfortable. 0

However, 0
in 0
Senator 0
Grassley’s 0
e-mail 0
thanking 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
for 0
finally 0
agreeing 0
to 0
a 0
time 0
certain 0
for 0
her 0
testimony, 0
Senator 0
Grassley 0
correctly 0
reminded 0
her 0
attorneys 0
that 0
“the 0
committee 0
determines 0
which 0
witnesses 0
to 0
call, 0
how 0
many 0
witnesses 0
to 0
call, 0
and 0
what 0
order 0
to 0
call 0
them 0
and 0
who 0
will 0
question 0
them. 0

These 0
are 0
nonnegotiable.” 0

While 0
the 0
negotiations 0
with 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
attorneys 0
for 0
her 0
testimony 0
were 0
underway, 0
Democrats 0
were 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
latest 0
allegations, 0
ready 1
to 1
pounce 1
as 0
soon 0
as 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
accusation 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
be 0
heard. 0

Some 0
Democrats 0
are 0
already 0
using 0
the 0
Ramirez 0
episode 0
to 0
push 0
anew 0
for 0
a 0
fresh 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
and 0
to 0
postpone 0
Thursday’s 0
scheduled 0
hearing. 0

Ideally, 0
if 0
the 0
Democrats 0
cannot 0
apply 0
enough 0
pressure 0
to 0
force 0
a 0
withdrawal 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
through 0
their 0
relentless 0
campaign 0
of 0
character 1
assassination, 1
they 0
want 0
to 0
push 0
any 0
Senate 0
votes 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections 0
at 0
the 0
earliest. 0

Then 0
they 0
will 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
newly 0
elected 0
senators 0
should 0
be 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
confirmation 0
decision. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
adversaries 0
in 0
the 0
Senate, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
and 0
progressive 0
circles 0
continue 1
to 1
bludgeon 1
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
court 0
of 0
public 0
opinion. 0

All 0
of 0
their 0
stratagems 0
are 0
an 0
obvious 0
attempt 0
to 0
buy 0
time 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
persuade 0
any 0
wavering 0
senators 0
that 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
too 0
tainted 0
by 0
sexual 0
assault 0
charges 0
– 0
whether 0
proven 0
or 0
not 0
- 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

Proof 0
does 0
not 0
matter 0
to 0
those 0
wanting 0
to 0
bring 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
down 0
at 0
any 0
cost. 0

Regarding 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
accusation, 0
they 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
proof 0
so 0
far 0
is 0
non-existent, 0
aside 0
from 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
own 0
assertions 0
contained 0
in 0
her 0
confidential 0
letter 0
given 0
to 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein, 0
the 0
ranking 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
last 0
July, 0
and 0
in 0
her 0
Washington 0
Post 0
interview. 0

While 0
a 0
redacted 0
version 0
of 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
letter 0
has 0
been 0
published, 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
has 0
refused 0
to 0
date 0
to 0
give 0
even 0
Senator 0
Grassley 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
completely 0
unredacted 0
version. 0

The 0
FBI 0
has 0
already 0
conducted 0
6 0
background 0
checks, 0
no 0
federal 0
crime 0
is 0
alleged, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
forensic 0
evidence 0
to 0
investigate 0
after 0
30 0
years 0
at 0
a 0
site 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
cannot 0
even 0
identify. 0

What 1
we 1
do 1
know 1
so 1
far 1
tends 1
to 1
undercut 1
the 1
credibility 1
of 1
Ms. 1
Ford’s 1
accusation. 1

Ms. 0
Ford 0
cannot 0
corroborate 0
her 0
decades-old 0
charge 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Whatever 1
corroboration 1
Ms. 1
Ford 1
was 1
hoping 1
for 1
from 1
“witnesses” 1
she 1
claimed 1
were 1
at 1
the 1
alleged 1
party 1
is 1
non-existent. 1

The 0
individuals 0
she 0
reportedly 0
named 0
in 0
her 0
unredacted 0
confidential 0
letter 0
given 0
to 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
have 0
either 0
denied 0
being 0
at 0
such 0
a 0
party 0
or 0
do 0
not 0
recollect 0
what 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
has 0
alleged. 0

Moreover, 0
by 0
her 0
own 0
admission 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
“said 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
some 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
incident.” 0
She 0
does 0
not 0
remember, 0
for 0
example, 0
where 0
it 0
happened, 0
how 0
the 0
party 0
came 0
together 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
or 0
how 0
she 0
got 0
home 0
after 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident. 0

She 0
believes 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
occurred 0
during 0
the 0
summer 0
of 0
1982, 0
but 0
reportedly 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
more 0
precise 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
or 0
even 0
the 0
month 0
of 0
the 0
party. 0

Afraid 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
sexual 0
assault 0
allegation 0
could 0
be 0
readily 0
challenged 0
and 0
anxious 0
to 0
establish 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
pattern 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
beyond 0
this 0
single 0
alleged 0
incident, 0
the 1
Kavanaugh 1
haters 1
have 0
latched 0
onto 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez’s 0
story. 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
published 0
an 0
op-ed 0
column 0
last 0
week 0
by 0
a 0
psychiatrist, 0
Richard 0
A. 0
Friedman, 0
who 0
cited 0
neurological 0
science 0
to 0
conclude 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
claim 0
that 0
she 0
has 0
“a 0
vivid 0
memory 0
of 0
an 0
attack 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
15” 0
is 0
“credible.” 0
The 0
reason, 0
he 0
wrote, 0
is 0
that 0
“memories 0
formed 0
under 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
intense 0
emotion 0
— 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
feelings 0
that 0
accompany 0
a 0
sexual 0
assault 0
— 0
are 0
indelible 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
that 0
memories 0
of 0
a 0
routine 0
day 0
are 0
not.” 0
The 1
only 1
problem 1
with 1
Dr. 1
Friedman’s 1
thesis 1
is 1
that 1
Ms. 1
Ford 1
has 1
apparently 1
forgotten 1
such 1
key 1
details 1
surrounding 1
the 1
alleged 1
sexual 1
assault 1
as 1
when 1
and 1
where 1
it 1
happened 1
and 1
how 1
she 1
got 1
home. 1

Moreover, 0
when 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
finally 0
told 0
someone 0
about 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
any 0
detail 0
some 0
30 0
years 0
later 0
in 0
2012, 0
during 0
a 0
couples 0
therapy 0
session 0
with 0
her 0
husband, 0
she 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
specifically, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
therapist’s 0
notes 0
that 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
had 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
in 0
connection 0
with 0
her 0
interview. 0

The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
therapist’s 0
notes 0
it 0
reviewed 0
“do 0
not 0
mention 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
name 0
but 0
say 0
she 0
reported 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
attacked 0
by 0
students 0
‘from 0
an 0
elitist 1
boys’ 1
school’ 1
who 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
become 0
‘highly 0
respected 0
and 0
high-ranking 0
members 0
of 0
society 0
in 0
Washington.’” 0

Ms. 0
Ramirez’s 0
story 0
is 0
even 0
less 0
credible. 0

It 0
took 0
an 0
attorney 0
and 0
six 0
days 0
of 0
very 0
belated 0
reflection 0
to 0
help 0
revive 0
her 0
memory 0
of 0
an 0
incident 0
she 0
claimed 0
happened 0
while 0
she 0
herself 0
was 0
very 0
drunk. 0

Senator 0
Mazie 0
Hirono 0
(D-Hawaii), 0
one 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
fiercest 0
critics 0
who 0
told 0
men 0
to 0
“shut 0
up” 0
regarding 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
allegations, 0
said 0
she 1
doubts 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
credibility 1
because 1
of 1
“how 1
he 1
approaches 1
his 1
cases.” 1
Aside 0
from 0
mischaracterizing 0
the 0
constitutional 0
textualist 0
reasoning 0
underlying 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
opinions, 0
she 0
is 0
saying 0
that 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
believe 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
denial 0
of 0
the 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
allegations 0
lodged 0
against 0
him 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
opinions 0
he 0
wrote 0
that 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
like. 0

Such 0
circular 0
“reasoning” 0
would 0
be 0
amusing 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
not 0
so 0
emblematic 0
of 0
what 0
one 0
writer 0
called 0
“Kavanaugh 1
Derangement 1
Syndrome." 1

Senator 0
Kirsten 0
Gillibrand 0
(D-N.Y.) 0
is 0
also 0
suffering 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
syndrome. 0

She 0
said 0
Thursday 0
regarding 0
Ms. 0
Ford: 0
"I 0
believe 1
her 1
because 1
she 1
is 1
telling 1
the 1
truth 1
and 1
you 1
know 1
it 1
by 1
her 1
story." 1

Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
supporters 0
are 0
exploiting 0
the 0
“Me 1
Too” 1
movement 1
to 0
declare 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
guilty 0
simply 1
because 1
Ms. 1
Ford 1
is 1
a 1
woman 1
who 1
has 1
made 1
what 1
they 1
call, 1
without 1
any 1
corroborating 1
evidence 1
to 1
date, 1
a 1
“credible” 1
charge. 1

The 0
same 0
would 0
presumably 0
be 0
the 0
case 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Ramirez. 0

They 0
argue 0
that 0
since 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
criminal 0
judicial 0
trial, 0
but 0
rather 0
a 0
legislative 0
hearing 0
for 0
confirmation 0
of 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee, 0
the 0
normal 0
burden 0
of 0
proof 0
shouldered 0
by 0
the 0
accuser 0
should 0
not 0
apply. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
should 0
have 0
to 0
prove 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
guilty, 0
they 0
are 0
in 0
effect 0
insisting. 0

This 0
is 0
another 0
case 0
of 0
Kavanaugh 1
Derangement 1
Syndrome. 1

Let’s 0
assume 0
for 0
the 0
sake 0
of 0
argument 0
that 0
the 0
normal 0
burden 0
on 0
the 0
prosecution 0
in 0
a 0
criminal 0
case 0
- 0
to 0
prove 0
the 0
accused’s 0
guilt 0
beyond 0
a 0
reasonable 0
doubt 0
- 0
is 0
not 0
applicable 0
regarding 0
the 0
charge 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
since 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
defendant 0
in 0
a 0
criminal 0
trial. 0

However, 0
that 0
should 0
not 0
flip 0
the 0
burden 0
of 0
proof 0
onto 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
altogether. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
being 0
subjected 0
to 0
charges 0
of 0
a 0
criminal 0
nature 0
that 0
could 0
not 0
only 0
deprive 0
him 0
of 0
a 0
seat 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
for 0
which 0
he 0
is 0
otherwise 0
eminently 0
qualified. 0

Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
unsubstantiated 0
accusation 0
can 0
completely 1
destroy 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
life 1
by 0
causing 0
irreparable 0
damage 0
to 0
his 0
reputation 0
for 0
integrity 0
and 0
good 0
character 0
and 0
to 0
his 0
career, 0
which 0
he 0
has 0
built 0
up 0
during 0
decades 0
of 0
public 0
service. 0

His 0
family’s 0
lives 0
have 0
been 0
completely 0
upended. 0

Placing 0
the 0
burden 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
prove 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
uncorroborated 0
incident 0
from 0
years 0
ago, 0
about 0
which 0
even 0
his 0
accuser 0
does 0
not 0
recall 0
key 0
details, 0
turns 1
the 1
fundamental 1
constitutional 1
principle 1
of 1
due 1
process 1
upside 1
down. 1

Ms. 0
Ford 0
should 0
have 0
the 0
burden 0
to 0
prove 0
her 0
accusations 0
by 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
preponderance 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
evidence 0
presented. 0

This 1
charade 1
must 0
come 0
to 0
an 0
end. 0

No 0
more 0
extensions 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
and 0
testify. 0

If 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
does 0
not 0
follow 0
through 0
with 0
her 0
agreement 0
to 0
testify 0
in 0
an 0
open 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
hearing 0
this 0
Thursday 0
and 0
do 0
so 0
upon 0
the 0
conditions 0
set 0
by 0
the 0
committee, 0
she 0
should 0
go 0
home 0
while 0
the 0
committee 0
proceeds 0
to 0
an 0
immediate 0
vote 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination. 0

If 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
and 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
do 0
testify, 0
the 0
senators 0
deciding 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
confirm 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
American 0
public 0
following 0
the 0
testimony 0
must 0
remember 0
one 0
cardinal 0
rule. 0

In 1
a 1
nation 1
guided 1
by 1
fairness 1
and 1
law, 1
a 1
person 1
is 1
innocent 1
until 1
proven 1
guilty. 1

Sadly, 0
many 0
of 0
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
haters 1
have 0
thrown 0
that 0
rule 0
aside. 0

If 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
is 0
pulled 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
smears 1
and 0
character 1
assassination, 1
President 0
Trump 0
should 0
immediately 0
nominate 0
someone 0
on 0
his 0
short 0
list 0
such 0
as 0
Amy 0
Coney 0
Barrett 0
and 0
the 0
Senate 0
Republican 0
majority 0
should 0
then 0
push 0
through 0
the 0
new 0
nominee’s 0
confirmation 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible. 0

Delay 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
option. 0

In 0
his 0
speech, 0
he 0
encouraged 0
those 0
listening 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
alone, 0
and 0
said 0
the 0
gathering 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
was 0
meant 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
voice 0
to 0
the 0
UK 0
government 0
to 0
"Free 0
Tommy 0
Robinson!" 0

Batten 0
echoed 0
that 0
sentiment 0
saying, 0
“Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
a 0
political 1
prisoner." 1

“Whatever 0
the 0
legal 0
technicalities 0
of 0
his 0
alleged 0
contempt 0
of 0
court, 0
he 0
was 0
imprisoned 0
more 0
for 0
who 0
he 0
is 0
and 0
what 0
he 0
says 0
rather 0
than 0
what 0
he 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
have 0
done.," 0
he 0
added. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
necessary 0
to 0
agree 0
with 0
everything 0
he 0
says, 0
it’s 0
not 0
necessary 0
to 0
approve 0
of 0
everything 0
he 0
does, 0
but 0
history 0
will 0
judge 0
him 0
as 0
being 0
on 0
the 0
right 0
side 0
of 0
a 0
struggle 1
between 1
good 1
and 1
evil,” 1
Batten 0
continued. 0

He 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
blast 0
the 0
policies 0
of 0
the 0
UK 0
that 0
are 0
truly 0
harming 0
their 0
own 0
people, 0
specifically 0
“widespread, 1
organized, 1
paedophile 1
rape 1
of 1
little 1
girls 1
by 1
organized 1
gangs” 1
while 0
those 0
in 0
authority 0
“brush 0
it 0
under 0
the 0
carpet.” 0

“Governments 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
and 0
across 0
Europe 0
are 0
now 0
the 0
enemies 1
of 0
their 0
own 0
people, 0
[and] 0
they 0
promote 0
policies 0
that 0
are 0
against 0
the 0
interests 0
of 0
their 1
own 1
people,” 1
he 0
railed 0
— 0
citing 0
efforts 0
to 0
sabotage 0
Brexit, 0
uncontrolled 0
mass 0
migration, 0
and 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
“Islamisation” 0
in 0
particular," 0
he 0
said. 0

“A 0
literalist 0
interpretation 0
of 0
the 0
Mohammedan 0
cult 0
is 0
completely 0
alien 0
to 0
everything 0
our 1
country 1
stands 0
for 0
and 0
our 1
traditional 1
way 1
of 1
life," 1
Batten 0
continued. 0

“And 0
yet 0
instead 0
of 0
opposing 0
Islamisation, 0
our 0
government 0
is 0
submitting 0
and 0
surrendering 0
to 0
it. 0

They 0
have 0
betrayed 1
the 1
British 1
people." 1

“Now, 0
‘Islam’ 0
means 0
‘Submission’. 0

You 1
either 1
submit, 1
or 1
you 1
resist. 1

Are 0
you 0
going 0
to 0
submit?” 0
he 0
asked 0
the 0
crowds. 0

“Are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
resist?” 1

The 0
crowd 0
shouted 0
back 0
their 0
support 0
of 0
resisting 0
and 0
not 0
submitting 0
to 0
the 0
Islamization 0
of 0
their 0
culture. 0

Sharia 0
Watch 0
founder 0
Anne 0
Marie 0
Waters 0
also 0
spoke 0
at 0
the 0
rally. 0

“Our 0
leaders, 0
our 0
media, 0
our 0
police, 0
all 0
prioritize 0
Islam 0
in 0
their 0
decision-making,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“Why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
easy 1
for 1
our 1
state 1
to 1
jail 1
Tommy 1
Robinson, 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
so 1
difficult 1
to 1
jail 1
a 1
group 1
of 1
men 1
found 1
with 1
an 1
underage 1
girl 1
in 1
a 1
bedroom? 1

Why 0
is 0
it 0
so 0
much 0
easier 0
to 0
jail 0
Tommy 0
Robinson? 0

“Why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
easy 1
to 0
jail 0
a 0
man 0
for 0
leaving 0
bacon 0
at 0
a 0
mosque, 0

so 0
difficult 0

jihadis 0
who 0

and 0
death 0
to 0
the 0
British 1
people?" 1

she 0
continued 0
in 0
a 0
line 0
of 0
questioning. 0

“Why 1
is 1
it 1
so 1
easy 1
for 0
judges 0
to 0
make 0
rulings 0
that 0
allow 0
known 0
terrorists 0
and 0
jihadists 0
to 0
stay 0
in 0
our 1
country? 1

Why 0
is 0
the 0
British 0
government 0
allowing 0
ISIS 0
fighters 0
to 0
return 0
from 0
Syria 0
and 0
threaten 0
our 1
safety? 1

“Why 0
do 0
we 0
talk 0
and 0
investigate 0
and 0
get 0
angry 0
about 0
an 0
accidental 0
fire 0
in 0
Grenfell, 0

are 0

to 0
immediately 0

‘not 0

back 0

anger’ 0
— 0
about 0
the 0
deliberate, 0
ideology-driven 0
murder 0
of 0
British 1
children?" 1

Waters 0
went 0
on. 0

“And 0
why 1
are 1
Muslims 1
allowed 1
to 1
cover 1
their 1
faces 1
with 1
a 1
black 1
sack 1
while 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
us 1
are 1
subject 1

Why 1
are 0
children 0
being 0
mutilated 1
and 1
forcefully 1
raped 1
while 0
the 1
law 1
looks 1
the 1

Forcefully 1
married, 0
child 0

the 1

Why? 1

Why 1

“Why 1
is 0
it 0
so 0
easy, 0
Theresa 0

to 0

Why?” 1
Waters 0
asked. 0

Well, 0
the 0
questions 0
are 0
obviously 0
rhetorical. 0

We 0
know 0
why. 0

The 0
UK 0
is 0
frightened 0
of 0
the 0
Islamists, 0

by 0
being 0
frightened 0
into 0
submission, 0
they 0
are 0

complicit 0
in 0
the 0

there. 0

Kassam 0
also 0
spoke 0
at 0
the 0
event, 0
reminding 0
supporters 0
of 0
what 0
was 0
happening 0
all 0
across 0
Europe 0
due 0
the 0
mass 0
influx 0
of 0
Muslim 0
migrants. 0

Then 0
he 0
encouraged 0
them 0
with 0
a 0
piece 0
of 0
American 0
history. 0

“I’m 0
sure 0
we 0
have 0
some 0
American 1
friends 1
in 0
the 0

on 0
stage, 0

Kassam 0
concluded. 0

“You 0
know 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
man 0
called 0
Paul 0
Revere. 0

He 0
rode 0
through 0
the 0
night 0
on 0
his 0

said, 0
‘The 0

that 0
is 0
true, 0
but 0
unless 0
the 0
Brits 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
same 0
kind 0
of 0
fear 0
in 0
their 0
representatives 0
that 0
the 0
Muslims 0
are 0
doing, 0
they 0
can't 0
expect 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
they 0
want 0
to 0
do. 0

What 0
Britain 0
needs 0
is 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
the 1
God 1
of 1
their 1
forefathers, 1
the 0
One 0
Oliver 0
Cromwell 0
served. 0

They 0
need 0
to 0
fear 0
Him 0
more 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
the 0
Islamic 0
terrorists 0
and 0
rape 0
gangs. 0

Then, 1
and 1
only 1
then, 1
will 0
they 0
render 0
justice 0
for 0
the 0
Muslim 0
criminals, 0
rid 0
their 0
land 0
of 0
such 0
public 0
idolatry 1
and 0
protect 0
the 0
people 0
like 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
who 0
rightly 0
tell 0

itself 0

of 0
their 0

was 0
a 0
joint 0
invocation 0
performed 0
by 0
a 0
rabbi, 0
two 0
pastors 0
and 0
an 0
imam. 0

The 0
imam, 0
Maulana 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed, 0
is 0
notorious 0
for 0
his 0
unapologetic 0
vilification 0
of 0

is 0
the 0

of 0
the 0
Darul 0
Uloom 0
Institute, 0
located 0
in 0
Pembroke 0
Pines, 0
Florida. 0

The 0
mosque 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
haven 0
for 0
terror-related 0
individuals 0

in 0

– 0
and 0

has 0
been 0
around 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
– 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed’s 0
personal 0
history 0
deals 0
much 0
more 0
in 0
bigotry 0
than 0
terror. 0

One 0
stop 0
on 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed’s 0
Facebook 0
page 0
and 0
one 0
can 0
view 0
his 0
profile 0
photo 0
of 0
him 0
holding 0
a 0
dark 0
green 0
book 0
with 0
gold 0
border 0
and 0
letters 0
on 0
the 0
cover. 0

The 0
book 0
is 0
“The 0
Meaning 0
of 0
THE 0
HOLY 0
QUR’AN,” 0
a 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
Quran 0
that 0
was 0
banned 0
by 0
the 0
Los 0
Angeles 0
public 0
school 0
system, 0
in 0
February 0
2002, 0
for 0
containing 0
numerous 0
anti-Semitic 0
commentaries. 0

In 0
it, 0
Jews 0
are 0
described 0
as: 0
“arrogant,” 1
“jealous,” 1
“selfish,” 1
“spiteful,” 1
“greedy,” 1
“cursed,” 1
“apes 1
and 1
swine,” 1
and 0
“under 1
divine 1
displeasure.” 1

This 1
may 1
seem 1
an 1
innocent 1
mistake 1
on 1
the 1
imam’s 1
part, 1
but 1
his 1
actions 1
against 1
the 1
gay 1
community 1
and 1
sinister 1
views 1
are 1
anything 1
but. 1

In 0
February 0
2005, 0
an 0
article 0
written 0
by 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
was 0
published 0
on 0
the 0
Darul 0
Uloom 0
website, 0
entitled 0
‘Tsunami: 0
Wrath 0
of 0
God.’ 0
In 0
it, 0
he 0
claims 0
that 0
gay 0
sex 0
caused 0
the 0
2004 0
Indonesian 0
tsunami 0
and 0
that 0
most 0
Jews 0
and 0
Christians, 0
whom 0
he 0
refers 0
to 0
as 0
“People 0
of 0
the 0
Book,” 0
are 0
“perverted 1
transgressors.” 1

It 0
is 0
writings 0
such 0
as 0
these 0
that 0
have 0
gotten 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
thrown 0
off 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Broward 0
County 0
boards. 0

Even 0
so, 0
the 0
imam 0
has 0
been 0
unrepentant. 0

In 0
a 0
speech 0
he 0
gave 0
at 0
Darul 0
Uloom, 0
in 0
August 0
2015, 0
titled 0
‘Quraan 0
Torah 0
Bible 0
Forbid 0
Man 0
Marrying 0
Man,’ 0
he 0
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
“got 0
sacked 0
from 0
many 0
[county] 0
boards, 0
because 0
there 0
were 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
gay 0
people 0
who 0
said, 0
‘We 0
don’t 0
want 0
him 0
on 0
that 0
board.’” 0
He 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
choice, 0
to 0
“sit 0
in 0
Paradise 0
or… 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
board 0
and 0
go 0
to 0
Hell.” 0

He 0
began 0
his 0
speech 0
by 0
attacking 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
for 0
supporting 0
same-sex 0
marriage. 0

He 0
asked 0
the 0
following, 0
“Did 0
you 0
hear 0
what 0
President 0
Obama 0
said?… 0
Do 0
you 0
know 0
what 0
a 0
sad 0
situation 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
this 0
country?... 0

Here 0
you 0
have 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
saying 0
that 0
a 0
man 0
could 0
marry 0
a 0
man?… 0
Are 0
we 0
sleeping? 0

Do 0
you 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Quran? 0

Are 0
we 0
gonna 0
sit 0
and 0
have 0
the 0
Quran 0
be 0
ridiculed?” 0
He 0
then 0
cited 0
the 0
Christian 0
and 0
Jewish 0
Bible, 0
barking 1
loudly, 0
“The 0
Bible 0
says 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
man 0
sleeps 0
with 0
a 0
man, 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
killed!” 0

Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
later 0
lamented 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
Muslim 0
homosexuals. 0

He 0
decried, 0
“Listen. 0

Don’t 0
deny 0
it. 0

They 0
already 0
got 0
Muslim 0
gay 0
communities.” 0
He 0
as 0
well 0
spoke 0
of 0
his 0
support 0
for 0
polygamy, 0
an 0
act 0
that 0
is 0
illegal 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

He 0
exclaimed, 0
“Here 0
the 0
President 0
says 0
a 0
man 0
can 0
marry 0
a 0
man, 0
but 0
you 0
can’t 0
say 0
a 0
man 0
can 0
have 0
four 0
wives…!” 0

The 0
October 0
TKJ 0
Dinner 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
Democrat 0
event 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
has 0
participated 0
in. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
has 0
been 0
involved 0
in 0
many, 0
including 0
giving 0
the 0
invocations 0
at 0
the 0
Florida 0
Democratic 0
Party’s 0
annual 0
Leadership 0
Blue 0
Gala 0
in 0
2014 0
(featuring 0
Bill 0
Clinton), 0
2015 0
and 0
2016. 0

And 0
given 0
that 0
this 0
author 0
has 0
written 0
about 0
this 0
before, 0
the 0
October 0
event 0
will 0
probably 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
last 0
occasion 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
embraced 0
by 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Shafayat 0
Mohamed 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
Muslim 0
extremist 0
that 0
has 0
participated 0
in 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party’s 0
TKJ 0
Dinner. 0

In 0
October 0
2015, 0
the 0
dinner 0
invocation 0
was 0
performed 0
by 0
Wilfredo 0
Amr 0
Ruiz, 0
the 0
legal 0
adviser 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
Muslim 0
Association 0
of 0
North 0
America 0
(AMANA), 0
a 0
group 0
that 0
actively 0
promotes 0
former 0
KKK 0
leader 0
and 0
white 1
supremacist 1
David 0
Duke. 0

Ruiz, 0
as 0
well, 0
founded 0
AMANA’s 0
Connecticut 0
and 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
chapters. 0

In 0
July 0
2010, 0
the 0
Anti-Defamation 0
League 0
(ADL) 0
condemned 0
Ruiz’s 0
AMANA 0
for 0
posting 0
what 0
the 0
ADL 0
called 0
a 0
“venomous” 1
anti-Semitic 0
Duke 0
video 0
onto 0
the 0
group’s 0
official 0
website. 0

AMANA 0
is 0
currently 0
promoting 0
another 0
anti-Semitic 0
Duke-produced 0
video, 0
on 0
the 0
AMANA 0
site. 0

The 0
President 0
of 0
AMANA, 0
Sofian 0
Zakkout, 0
has 0
referred 0
to 0
Duke 0
as 0
“David 0
Duke, 0
a 1
man 1
to 1
believe 1
in!” 1

By 0
inviting 0
people 0
like 0
Shafayat 0
Mohamed, 0
an 0
avowed 0
enemy 0
of 0
the 0
gay 0
community, 0
and 0
Wilfredo 0
Ruiz, 0
whose 0
group 0
promotes 0
white 0
supremacists, 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
its 0
functions, 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
has 0
effectively 0
revealed 0
its 0
disregard 0
for 0
the 0
concerns 0
of 0
those 0
it 0
disingenuously 0
claims 0
to 0
advocate 0
for 0
and 0
protect. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
for 0
Democrats 0
to 0
reject 0
the 0
bigotry 0
of 0
these 0
radicals 0
and 0
see 0
them 0
for 0
the 0
liability 0
they 0
present. 0

Failure 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
exposes 1
the 1

Haspel 0
& 0
Pompeo 0

Senator 0
Rand 0
Paul 0
(R-KY) 0
has 0
expressed 0
some 0
of 0
my 0
thoughts 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
newly 0
nominated 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
and 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
Central 0
Intelligence 0
Agency. 0

Paul 0
told 0
CNN’s 0
“State 0
of 0
the 0
Union” 0
and 0
CBS 0
News’ 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation” 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
do 0
"whatever 0
it 0
takes," 0
including 0
a 0
filibuster, 0
to 0
block 0
the 0
confirmations 0
of 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
to 0
head 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
and 0
Gina 0
Haspel 0
to 0
run 0
the 0
CIA. 0

“You 1
really 1
want 1
a 1
diplomat 1
to 1
be 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
the 1
State 1
Department, 1
not 1
someone 1
who 1
is 1
advocating 1
for 1
war,” 1
he 0
told 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation.” 0

“I 0
frankly 0
think 0
that 0
Pompeo’s 0
positions 0
are 0
too 0
much 0
of 0
an 0
advocate 0
for 0
regime 0
change, 0
really 0
everywhere,” 0
he 0
added. 0

"I 0
don't 0
think 0
our 0
policy 0
ought 0
to 0
be 0
for 0
regime 0
change, 0
so 0
I 0
think 0
Pompeo 1
really 1
isn't 1
a 1
good 1
fit 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
diplomat." 1

He's 0
right, 0
too. 0

Pompeo 0
has 0
advocated 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
North 0
Korea. 0

We've 0
seen 0
exactly 0
what 0
happens 0
when 0
the 0
US 0
gets 0
involved 0
in 0
such 0
types 0
of 0
regime 0
changes, 0
and 0
the 0
truth 0
is 0
that 0
they 0
really 0
don't 0
work 0
out 0
too 0
well. 0

As 0
for 0
Haspel, 0
Paul 0
told 0
"Face 0
The 0
Nation," 0
"She 0
oversaw 0
an 0
illegal 0
black 0
ops 0
operation 0
in 0
Thailand 0
that 0
included 0
torture. 0

I 1
don't 1
think 1
torture 1
is 1
what 1
America 1
is 1
about." 1

On 0
"State 0
of 0
the 0
Union," 0
Paul 0
added, 0
"I'll 0
do 0
whatever 0
it 0
takes, 0
and 0
that 0
includes 0
filibuster" 0
to 0
block 0
their 0
confirmation. 0

"I 0
don't 0
have 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
stop 0
her 0
nomination," 0
he 0
said 0
of 0
Haspel. 0

"There's 0
enough 0
votes 0
she'll 0
eventually 0
win. 0

Few 1
things 1
in 1
life 1
. 1

. 1

. 1

[are] 1
worth 1
standing 1
up 1
saying 0
'enough 1
is 1
enough.'" 1

"We 1
are 1
not 1
a 1
people 1
that 1
should 1
be 1
so 1
fearful 1
or 1
vengeful 1
that 1
we 1
think 1
that 1
torture 1
is 1
somehow 1
acceptable," 1
he 0
added. 0

"On 0
what 0
level 0
could 0
torture 0
ever 0
be 0
acceptable? 0

We 1
should 1
make 1
a 1
stand 1
on 1
this. 1

She 1
should 1
never 1
lead 1
the 1
CIA." 1

Both 0
nominations 0
may 0
face 0
tough 0
confirmation 0
hearings, 0
but 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
many 1
Americans 1
are 1
just 1
fine 1
with 1
these 1
types 1
of 1
people 1
being 1
in 1
these 1
types 1
of 1
offices. 1

The 0
only 0
thing 0
I 0
can 0
think 0
for 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
reasoning 0
is 0
that 0
people 1
do 1
not 1
know 1
their 1
Constitution 1
and 1
understand 1
exactly 1
what 1
Senator 1
Paul 1
is 1
trying 1
to 1
warn 1
America 1
about. 1

Instead, 0
people 0
are 0
acting 0
out 0
of 0
emotion 0
and 0
fear. 0

Do 0
I 0
believe 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
concerned 0
about 0
North 0
Korea? 0

Sure, 0
but 0
I'm 0
hardly 0
worried 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
actually 0
attack 0
us. 0

Am 0
I 0
concerned 0
about 0
jihadis? 0

Yep, 0
but 0
I'm 0
not 0
sure 0
I've 0
seen 0
any 0
real 0
hard 0
evidence 0
that 0
torturing 0
them 0
has 0
produced 0
any 0
information 0
that 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
stopping 0
terror 0
attacks. 0

And 0
before 0
you 0
tell 0
me 0
about 0
the 0
media 0
reports 0
and 0
CIA 0
involvement, 0
just 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
a 1
former 1
journalist, 1
who 1
is 1
now 1
dead, 1
told 1
the 1
world 1
that 1
the 1
media 1
lies 1
for 1
the 1
CIA. 1

So, 1
I'm 1
wary 1
of 1
media 1
reports 1
that 1
claim 1
there 1
have 1
been 1
results 1
from 1
the 1
tactics 1
used. 1

Trump 1
has 1
obviously 1
had 1
praise 1
for 1
both 1
Pompeo 1
and 1
Haspel, 1
but 1
then 1
again, 1
his 1
administration 1
has 1
quite 1
a 1
bit 1
of 1
turn 1
over 1
too. 1

Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
will 0
become 0
our 0
new 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

He 1
will 1
do 1
a 1
fantastic 1
job! 1

Thank 0
you 0
to 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
for 0
his 0
service! 0

Gina 0
Haspel 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
new 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
and 0
the 0
first 0
woman 0
so 0
chosen. 0

Congratulations 0
to 0

of 0
the 0
airborne 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
or 0
black 1

in 0

Officials 0

that 0
it’s 0

that 0
this 0

infection 0
that’s 0
infected 0
over 0
2000 0
people 1
will 1
become 1

The 0
only 0
way 0
to 0
treat 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
contracted 0
the 0

is 0
with 0
antibiotics. 0

But 0
experts 0
now 0
warn 0
that 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
used 0
so 0
much 0
to 0
treat 0
the 0
infection, 0
antibiotics 1
resistance 1
is 1

making 0
this 0

Once 1
the 1

the 0

should 0
the 0

can 0
assume 0
that 0
it 0
will 0
be 0

increasing 1

at 0
Attorney 0

In 0
an 0
early 0
Friday 0
post 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
Trump 0
wrote 0
that 0
her 1
sentence 1
of 1
63 1
months 1
in 1
federal 1
prison 1
was 1
unfair 1
and 1
accused 1
Sessions 1
of 1
having 1
a 1
double 1
standard. 1

“Gee, 1
this 1
is 1
‘small 1
potatoes’ 1
compared 1
to 1
what 1

he 0

“So 1
unfair 1
Jeff, 1
Double 1

The 0
tweet 0
drew 0
no 0

But 0
Winner’s 0

a 0
blunt 0
reply: 0
“Please 0

the 0

the 0
26-year-old 0

linguist, 0
who 0
on 0

a 0

and 0
said 0
she 0
takes 0
“full 0

Before 0
her 0
arrest, 0
Winner 0
called 0
Trump 0
an 1
“orange 1
fascist” 1
on 0
Twitter. 0

Her 0
disillusionment 0
about 0

was 0
part 0
of 0
her 0
reason 0
for 0
leaving 0
the 0
Air 0

her 0

told 0

“Something 0

three 0

From 0
here 0
relations 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
nuclear 0
powers 0
deteriorated 0

As 1
I 1

Stephen 1
Cohen 1
have 1
emphasized, 1
the 1
danger 1
of 1
nuclear 1
war 1
is 1
today 1
far 1
higher 1
than 1
ever 1
during 1
the 1
long 1
Cold 1
War 1
as 1
there 1
is 1
today 1
no 1
trust 1
whatsoever 1
between 1
the 1
two 1
governments. 1

Donald 0
Trump 0
is 1
totally 1
correct 1
that 0
nuclear 0
war 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
terminable 0
event 0
and 0
that 0
nothing 1
is 1
more 1
important 1
than 0
restoring 0
a 0
cooperative 0
and 0
mutually 0
respectful 0
relationship 0
between 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
Russia. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
sees 0
it 0
differently. 0

After 0
70 0
years 0
of 0
entrenchment 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
an 0
independent 0
political 0
force. 0

President 0
Eisenhower 0
warned 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
about 0
this 0
likely 0
outcome 0
in 0
1961 0
to 0
no 0
avail. 0

From 0
the 0
standpoint 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex, 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
normalizing 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
downgrades 0
the 0
“Russian 0
threat” 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
essential 0
to 0
the 0
$1,000 0
billion 0
annual 0
budget 0
of 0
the 0
military/security 0
complex 0
and 0
the 0
power 0
that 0
such 0
a 0
massive 1
budget 1
conveys. 0

Only 0
16 0
countries 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
out 0
of 0
195 0
countries 0
have 0
a 0
GDP 0
greater 0
than 0
$1,000 0
billion. 0

The 0
military/security 0
complex 0
is 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
G-20 0
and 0
to 0
have 0
its 0
own 0
currency 0
and 0
military. 0

Obama’s 0
CIA 0
director, 0
John 0
Brennan, 0
quickly 0
organized 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
conspiracy 0
against 0
Trump. 0

Comey, 0
Rosenstein, 0
Clapper, 0
Mueller, 0
McCabe, 0
Peter 0

and 0

were, 0
and 0

participants 0
in 0
orchestrating 0
an 0
alleged 0
collusion 0
between 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
and 0
Vladimir 0
Putin 0
to 0
steal 0
the 0
US 0
presidential 0
election. 0

Based 0
on 0
deception 0
of 0
the 0
FISA 0
Court, 0
warrants 0
were 0
illegally 0
obtained 0
that 0
became 0
the 0
basis 0
for 0
appointing 0
Mueller 0
as 0
a 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
to 0
construct 0
by 0
whatever 0
means 0
possible 0
a 0
case 0
against 0
President 0
Trump. 0

After 0
two 0
years 0
the 0
only 0
evidence 0
we 0
have 0
of 0
Russiagate 0
is 0
that 0
it 1
is 1
a 1
conspiracy 1
against 1
President 1
Trump 1
and 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

Indeed, 0
Mueller, 0
fully 0
aware 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
Trump-Putin 0
conspiracy, 0
has 0
not 0
bothered 0
to 0
look 0
for 0
any 0
evidence 0
as 0
there 0
can 0
be 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
something 0
that 0
did 0
not 0
happen. 0

He 0
pulled 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
hat 0
some 0
phony 0
and 0
meaningless 0
indictments 0
of 0
some 0
Russians 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
look 0
like 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
without 0
having 0
to 0
prove 0
it, 0
but 0
his 0
main 0
focus 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
framing 0
Paul 0
Manafort. 0

Mueller’s 0
investigation 0
of 0
Manafort 0
has 0
nothing 0

with 0
the 0

line. 0

Manafort’s 0
alleged 0
crimes 0
are 0
far 0
outside 0
Mueller’s 0
mandate 0
and 0
took 0
place, 0
if 0
they 0
did, 0
years 0
before 0
the 0
alleged 0
events 0
of 0
Russiagate. 0

Manafort’s 0
conviction 0
by 0
a 0
jury 0
on 0
8 0
of 0
the 0
18 0
counts 0
is 0
being 0
misrepresented 0
by 0
the 0
Trump-hating 0
presstitutes 0
as 0
vindication 0
of 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation 0
and 0
as 0
“A 0
dark 0
day 0
for 0
Trump,” 0
with 0
the 0
presstitutes 0
suggesting 0
a 0
Watergate 0
parallel 0
that 0
will 0
force 0
Trump 0
from 0
office. 0

Manafort 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
not 0
of 0
Russiagate, 0
but 0
of 0
income 0
tax 0
evasion 0
and 0
misrepresenting 0
his 0
financial 0
position 0
on 0
a 0
loan 0
application. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
if 0
Manafort 0
is 0
guilty 0
or 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
Mueller’s 0
frameup 0
and 0
an 1
incompetent 1
jury. 1

American 0
juries 0
are 0
notoriously 0
incompetent, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
97% 0
of 0
felony 0
indictments 0
are 0
settled 0
with 0
a 0
plea 0
bargain. 0

Even 0
the 0
innocent 0
had 0
rather 0
work 0
out 0
a 0
plea 0
arrangement 0
and 0
admit 0
to 0
something 0
that 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
than 0
to 0
face 0
an 1
insouciant 1
American 1
jury. 1

Remember 0
the 0
jury 0
that 0
condemned 0
the 0
survivors 0
of 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
massacre 0
of 0
the 0
Branch 0
Davidians 0
in 0
Waco, 0
Texas, 0
to 0
be 0
locked 0
away 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
not 0
talk 0
and 0
tell 0
of 0
the 0
mass 0
murder 0
inflicted 0
on 0
a 0
religious 0
group 0
by 0
the 0
FBI. 0

It 0
is 0
unclear 0
how 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
crime 0
it 0
can 0
be 0
to 0
misrepresent 0
your 0
financial 0
position 0
on 0
a 0
loan 0
application 0
when 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
causes 0
of 0
the 0
mortgage-backed 0
derivative 0
crisis 0
was 0
the 0
misrepresentation 0
of 0
mortgage 0
applicants 0
on 0
the 0
loan 0
documents 0
by 0
the 0
companies 0
issuing 0

Instead 0
of 0

Washington 0
relied 0
on 0
the 0
Federal 0

to 0
bail 0
out 0
the 0

holding 0
the 0
misrepresented 0

So, 1
why 1
did 1
Mueller 1
focus 1
on 1
Manafort? 1

Let 1
Harvard 1
Law 1
Professor 1
Alan 1
Dershowitz 1
tell 1
you: 1

“All 0
the 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
needs, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
charge 0
a 0
subject 0
of 0
an 0
investigation 0
with 0
lying 0
to 0
a 0
prosecutor, 0
is 0
a 0
single 0
witnesses 0
willing 0
to 0
contradict 0
the 0
subject. 0

“The 1
witness 1
may 1
not 1
only 1
be 1
“singing,” 1
he 1
may 1
also 1
be 1
“composing” 1
— 0
that 0
is, 0
making 0
up 0
or 0
embellishing 0
a 0
story 0
because 0
he 0
knows 0
that 0
the 0
better 0
his 0
story, 0
the 0
better 0
the 0
deal. 0

“Under 0
federal 0
law, 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
such 0
a 0
“flipped 1
witness” 1
need 0
not 0
be 0
corroborated 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
a 0
conviction. 0

“Even 0
one 0
question 0
that 0
results 0
in 0
an 0
answer 0
that 0
is 0
contradicted 0
by 0
one 0
witness 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
spring 1
the 1
perjury 1
trap.” 1

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
made 0
various 0
statements 0
disputing 0
the 0
orchestrated 0
Russiagate 0
accusations 0
that, 0
if 0
Manafort 0
as 0
witness 0
for 0
the 0
Special 0
Prosecutor 0
contradicted, 0
could 0
send 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
to 0
prison 0
for 0
perjury. 0

Knowing 0
this, 0
Mueller, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion 0
a 0
proven 0
corrupt 0
person, 0
decided 0
to 1
put 1
the 1
squeeze 1
on 0
Manafort 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
force 0
Manafort 0
to 0
save 0
himself 0
by 0
giving 0
false 0
testimony 0
against 0
Trump. 0

This 0
tactic 0
is 0
used 0
every 0
day 0
by 0
state, 0
local, 0
and 0
federal 0
prosecutors. 0

Americans 0
who 0
believe 0
the 0
indictments 0
and 0
convictions 0
are 0
unaware 0
that 0
97% 0
of 0
the 0
time 0
the 0
convictions 0
rest 0
on 0
self-incrimination 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
worse 0
punishment. 0

In 0
Manafort’s 0
case 0
it 0
didn’t, 0
or 0
hasn’t, 0
worked. 0

Yet. 0

Manafort 0
is 0
due 0
for 0
a 0
second 0
trial, 0
this 0
time 0
for 0
allegely 0
acting 0
as 0
an 0
unregistered 0
foreign 0
agent 0
for 0
Ukrainian 0
interests 0
and 0
for 0
making 0
false 0
statements 0
not 0
under 0
oath 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
government. 0

Reportedly, 0
Manafort 0
is 0
being 0
held 0
in 0
solitary 0
confinement, 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
torture 0
designed 0
to 0
break 0
a 0
person’s 0
spirit. 0

Like 0
Manafort’s 0
first 0
trial, 0
his 0
second 0
trial 0
has 0
nothing 0
whatsoever 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Russiagate, 0
but 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
learn 0
that 0
from 0
the 0
presstitute 0
media 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Manafort 0
can 0
still 0
be 0
coerced 0
to 0
say 0
something 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
drive 0
Trump 0
from 0
office. 0

What 0
about 0
Michael 0
Cohen, 0
a 0
former 0
attorney 0
for 0
Trump? 0

Mueller 0
saw 0
no 0
value 0
in 0
the 0
Cohen 0
case 0
and 0
passed 0
it 0
off 0
to 0
a 0
regular 0
US 0
attorney 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

Therefore, 0
it 0
would 0
appear 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
investigation. 0

Cohen 0
avoided 0
a 0
jury 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
guilty 0
of 0
five 0
counts 0
of 0
personal 0
income 0
tax 0
evasion, 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
making 0
a 0
false 0
statement 0
to 0
a 0
financial 0
institution 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
loan, 0
and 0
two 0
counts 0
related 0
to 0
illegal 0
campaign 0
contributions. 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
campagin 0
contributions, 0
he 0
contradicted 0
his 0
previous 0
statements. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
on 0
Trump’s 0
instruction, 0
he 0
paid 0
off 0
two 0
women 0
who 0
were 0
claiming 0
sexual 0
affairs 0
with 0
Trump. 0

The 1
intricacies 1
of 1
American 1
laws 1
relating 1
to 1
politics 1
are 1
often 1
unclear. 1

Apparently, 0
the 0
charge 0
is 0
that 0
Cohen 0
used 0
monies 0
raised 0
for 0
a 0
political 0
campaign 0
to 0
pay 0
off 0
two 0
women, 0
who 0
saw 0
and 0
capitalized 0
on 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
extort 0
Trump 0
for 0
money, 0
and 0
this 0
was 0
an 0
illegal 0
use 0
of 0
the 0
money. 0

Why 1
a 1
lawyer 1
would 1
pay 1
off 1
women, 1
whose 1
stories 1
might 1
or 1
might 1
not 1
be 1
true, 1
in 1
an 1
illegal 1
way 1
when 1
his 1
client 1
is 1
a 1
multi-billionaire 1
doesn’t 1
make 1
much 1
sense. 1

But 1
these 1
are 1
not 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
questions 1
that 1
the 1
presstitutes 1
are 1
interested 1
in. 1

Nevertheless, 0
Cohen’s 0
plea 0
is 0
associated 0
with 0
a 0
case 0
brought 0
by 0
another 0
prosecutor, 0
not 0
by 0
Special 0
Prosecutor 0
Mueller. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
sufficiently 0
familiar 0
with 0
US 0
legal 0
procedures 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
say 0
how 0
this 0
gets 0
brought 0
back 0
into 0
Mueller’s 0
investigation. 0

The 0
facts 0
are 0
this: 0

The 0
US 0
military/security 0
complex 0
will 0
not 0
permit 0
any 0
normalization 0
of 0
relations 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Period. 0

At 0
some 0
point 0
Putin 0
and 0
Lavrov 0
and 0
the 0
idiot 0
Russian 0
Atlanticist 0
Integrationists 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
this 0
fact, 0
or 0
Russia 0
will 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

Trump, 0
by 0
declaring 0
normalization 0
of 0
relations 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
his 0
two 0
principal 0
goals 0
for 0
his 0
presidency, 0
earned 0
the 0
emnity 0
of 0
the 0
powerful 0
military/security 0
complex. 0

By 0
defeating 0
Hillary 0
for 0
the 0
presidency, 0
Trump 0
inflamed 1
the 1
US 1
media’s 1
hatred, 1
committed 0
as 0
the 0
presstitutes 0

Identity 0
Politics 0
and 0
hatred 0
of 0
the 1
“white 1
male 1
oppressors” 1
who 1
elected 1
Trump. 1

Trump 0
will 0
never 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
preventing 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
female 0

an 0

crime 0
by 0
a 0
misogynist 0
white 0

The 0

President 0

up 0
for 0
himself 0
on 0

— 0
I 0

surprised 0
that 0

a 1
person 1
committed 1

How 0
can 0

person 0
so 0
unclued 0
survive? 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
during 0
the 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
Trump 0
has 0
no 0
idea 0
of 0
Washington 0
and 0
no 0
idea 0
who 0
to 0
appoint 0
who 0
would 0
support 0
him 0
rather 0
than 0
work 0
against 0
him. 0

Consequently, 0
he 0
has 0
a 0
government 0
working 0
against 0
him. 0

Senators 0
John 0
McCain 0
and 0
Lindsey 0
Graham 0
are 0
working 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
Republican 0
Party 0
from 0
supporting 0
the 0
party’s 0
president. 0

They 0
could 0
easily 0
succeed. 0

The 1
entirety 1
of 1
the 1
House 1
and 1
Senate 1
of 1
both 1
parties 1
is 1
in 1
thrall 1
to 1
the 1
campaign 1
donations 1
of 1
the 1
military/security 1
complex. 1

What 0
can 0
President 0
Trump 0
do? 0

He 0
could 0
fight, 0
not 0
with 0
words 0
on 0
Twitter, 0
but 0
with 0
the 0
powers 0
of 0
the 0
presidency. 0

There 0
is 0
far 0
more 0
evidence 0
that 0
Russiagate 0
is 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
against 0
the 0

that 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
Trump-Putin 0
conspiracy 0
to 0

the 0

If 0

use 0
US 0
military 0
force 0
against 0
Iran 0
is 0
unifying 0
a 0
new 0
alliance 0
that 0
is 0
too 0
powerful 0
for 0
the 0
Washington/Israeli 0
alliance. 0

Russia, 0
China, 0
Syria, 0
Turkey, 0
Iran, 0
India, 0
and 0
Pakistan 0
are 0
the 0
locations 0
of 0
populations 0
that 1
massively 1
outnumber 1
Washington’s 1
empire. 1

Each 0
of 0
these 0
countries 0
are 0
being 0
united 0
by 0
Washington’s 0
stupid 0
and 0
inexplicable 0
actions 0
against 0
each. 0

Militarily, 0
Israel 0
is 0
of 0
no 0
consequence. 0

Twice 0
the 0
vaunted 0
Israeli 0
Army, 0
capable 0
of 0
nothing 0
but 0
murdering 0
unarmed 0
women 0
and 0
children, 0
were 0
defeated 0
and 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
southern 0
Lebanon 0
by 0
a 0
few 0
thousand 0
Hezbollah 0
militia. 0

Israel 0
is 0
too 0
cowardly 0
to 0
try 0
it 0
a 0
third 0
time, 0
and 0
is 0
relying 0
on 0
the 0
stupid 0
Americans 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
job 0
for 0
them. 0

The 1
entire 1
world 1
looks 1
at 1
America 1
and 1
Israel, 1
and 0
what 0
does 0
the 0
world 0
see? 0

Two 0
countries, 0
both 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
exterminating 0
the 0
native 0
populations, 0
distrusted 0
and 0
universally 0
hated, 0
both 0
of 0
which 0
survive 0
by 0
purhasing 0
the 0
governments 0
of 0
other 0
countries 0
and 0
by 0
endless 0
lies 0
that 0
describe 0
everyone 0
but 0
themselves 0
and 0
their 0
vassals 0
as 0
evil 0
criminals 0
that 0
must 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

For 0
example, 0
the 0
Gaza 0
Strip, 0
the 0
largest 0
concentration 0
camp 0
ever 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
is 0
being 0
systematically 0
destroyed 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
life 0
within 0
it 0
by 0
Israel 0
under 1
cover 1
of 1
the 1
obvious 1
and 1
transparanent 1
lie 1
that 0
all 0
within 0
Gaza 0
are 0
terrorists 0
outfitted 0
with 0
bomb 0
belts 0
who 0
are 0
committed 0
to 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
Israel. 0

Not 0
only 0
men 0
of 0
fighting 0
age, 0
but 0
also 0
old 0
men, 0
pregnant 0
women, 0
children, 0
all 0
Palestinians 0
are 0
being 0
murdered 0
by 0
the 0
Israeli 0
military. 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
agrees 0
with 0
Israel 0
that 0
all 0
Palestinians 0
must 0
be 0
destroyed, 0
the 1
sooner 1
the 1
better. 1

The 0
Chinese 0
are 0
busy 0
taking 0
advantage 0
of 0
the 0
financial 0
opportunities 0
that 0
the 1
idiot 1
Americans 1
forfeit, 0
but 0
otherwise 0
do 0
not 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
any 0
strategic 0
sense 0
of 0
how 0
to 0
proceed 0
in 0
the 0
drama 0
unfolding 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
their 0
eyes. 0

For 0
China, 0
money 0
is 0
now 0
all. 0

The 0
Russians 0
are 0
infected 0
with 0
the 0
American 0
propaganda 0
infused 1
into 1
their 1
veins 1
during 0
the 0
Yeltsin 0
era 0
when 0
Russia 0
was 0
an 0
American 0
puppet 0
state. 0

Slowly, 0
if 0
not 0
surely, 0
the 0
Russians 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
their 0
senses 0
and 0
realizing 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
American 0
“partner.” 0

If 1
Trump 1
is 1
defeated 1
and 1
moved 1
off 1
the 1
table, 1
what 1
happens 1
when 1
Russia 1
and 1
China 1
finally 1
realize 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
no 1
conciliation 1
with 1
Washington? 1

When 1
all 1
the 1
false 1
hopes 1
and 1
bets 1
of 1
the 1
Russian 1
and 1
Chinese 1
governments 1
of 1
conciliation 1
on 1
the 1
basis 1
of 1
mutual 1
economic 1
interests 1
come 1
to 1
naught, 1
what 1
happens? 1

It 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
life 1
on 1
earth. 1

The 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation” 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
timed 0
to 0
influence 0
the 0
midterm 0
elections 0
with 0
unsubstantiated 0
accusations 0
made 0
just 0
before 0
the 0
elections 0
in 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
produce 0
a 0
Democratic 0
Congress 0
that 0
would 0
impeach 0
President 0
Trump 0
on 0
false 0
charges. 0

The 0
presstitutes 0
would 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
frameup. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
the 0
real 0
election 0
meddling 0
is 0
being 0
done 0
by 0
the 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation.” 0
See 0
here 0
and 0
here. 0

Such 1
an 1
impeachment 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
coup. 1

The 1
consequence 1
would 1
be 1
deep 1
and 1
permanent 1
divisions 1
in 1
American 1
political 1
life 1
and 1
more 1
rabid 1
Russiaphobia 1
that 1
would 1
result 1
in 1
war. 1

The 0
danger 0
is 0
real 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
Russiagate 0
“investigation” 0
aided 0
and 0
abetted 0
by 0
the 0
presstitute 0
media 0
will 0
result 0
in 0
nuclear 0
Armageddon. 0

The 0
war 0
for 0
dominance 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East, 0
following 0
the 0
crushing 0
of 0
ISIS, 0
appears 0
about 0
to 0
commence 0
in 0
Syria—with 0
NATO 0
allies 0
America 0
and 0
Turkey 0
on 0
opposing 0
sides. 0

Turkey 0
is 0
moving 0
armor 0
and 0
troops 0
south 0
to 0
Syria's 0
border 0
enclave 0
of 0
Afrin, 0
occupied 0
by 0
Kurds, 0
to 0
drive 0
them 0
out, 0
and 0
then 0
drive 0
the 0
Syrian 0
Kurds 0
out 0
of 0
Manbij 0
further 0
south 0
as 0
well. 0

Says 0
President 0
Recep 0
Tayyip 0
Erdogan, 0
" 0
We 0
will 0
destroy 0
all 0
terror 1
nests, 1
one 0
by 0
one, 0
in 0
Syria, 0
starting 0
from 0
Afrin 0
and 0
Manbij." 0

For 0
Erdogan, 0
the 0
Kurdish 0
YPG, 0
the 0
major 0
U.S. 0
ally 0
in 0
Syria, 0
is 0
an 0
arm 0
of 0
the 0
Kurdish 0
PKK 0
in 0
Turkey, 0
which 0
we 0
and 0
the 0
Turks 0
have 0
designated 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization. 0

While 0
the 0
Kurds 0
were 0
our 0
most 0
effective 0
allies 0
against 0
ISIS 0
in 0
Syria, 0
Turkey 0
views 0
them 0
as 0
a 0
mortal 1
peril 1
and 0
intends 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
that 0
threat. 0

If 1
Erdogan 1
is 1
serious, 1
a 1
clash 1
with 1
the 1
U.S. 1
is 1
coming, 1
as 0
our 0
Kurdish 0
allies 0
occupy 0
most 0
of 0
Syria's 0
border 0
with 0
Turkey. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
U.S. 0
has 0
announced 0
plans 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
30,000-man 0
Border 0
Security 0
Force 0
of 0
Kurds 0
and 0
Arabs 0
to 0
keep 0
ISIS 0
out 0
of 0
Syria. 0

Erdogan 0
has 0
branded 0
this 0
BSF 0
a 0
"terror 1
army," 1
and 0
President 0
Bashar 0
Assad 0
of 0
Syria 0
has 0
called 0
BSF 0
members 0
"traitors." 1

This 0
U.S. 0
plan 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
BSF 0
inside 0
Syria, 0
Damascus 0
declared 0
, 0
"represents 0
a 0
blatant 1
attack 1
on 1
the 1
sovereignty 1
and 1
territorial 1
integrity 1
and 0
unity 0
of 0
Syria, 0
and 0
a 0
flagrant 1
violation 1
of 1
international 1
law." 1

Does 1
not 1
the 1
Syrian 1
government 1
have 1
a 1
point? 1

Now 0
that 0
ISIS 0
has 0
been 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
Raqqa 0
and 0
Syria, 0
by 1
what 1
authority 1
do 1
U.S. 1
forces 1
remain 1
to 1
arm 1
troops 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
Damascus 1
government 1
from 1
reimposing 1
its 1
authority 1
on 1
its 1
own 1
territory? 1

Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Tillerson 0
gave 0
Syria 0
the 0
news 0
Wednesday. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
troop 0
commitment 0
to 0
Syria, 0
he 0
said, 0
is 0
now 0
open-ended. 0

Our 0
goals: 0
Guarantee 0
al-Qaida 0
and 0
ISIS 0
do 0
not 0
return 0
and 0
set 0
up 0
sanctuary; 0
cope 0
with 0
rising 0
Iranian 0
influence 0
in 0
Damascus; 0
and 0
pursue 0
the 0
removal 0
of 0
Bashar 0
Assad's 0
ruthless 1
regime. 0

But 1
who 1
authorized 1
this 1
strategic 1
commitment, 1
of 0
indefinite 0
duration, 0
in 0
Syria, 0
when 0
near 0
two 0
decades 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
secure 0
that 0
nation 0
against 0
the 0
return 0
of 0
al-Qaida 0
and 0
ISIS? 0

Again 0
and 0
again, 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
have 0
said 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
dragged 0
into 0
Syria's 0
civil 0
war. 0

Donald 1
Trump 1
won 1
the 1
presidency 1
on 1
a 1
promise 1
of 1
no 1
more 1
unnecessary 1
wars. 1

Have 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
been 1
had 1
again? 1

Will 0
they 0
support 0
a 0
clash 0
with 0
NATO 0
ally 0
Turkey, 0
to 0
keep 0
armed 0
Kurds 0
on 0
Turkey's 0
border, 0
when 0
the 0
Turks 0
regard 0
them 0
as 0
terrorists? 0

Are 1
we 1
prepared 1
for 1
a 1
shooting 1
war 1
with 1
a 1
Syrian 1
army, 1
backed 1
by 1
Russia, 1
Iran, 1
Hezbollah 1
and 1
Shiite 1
militias 1
from 1
Iraq, 1
Afghanistan 1
and 1
Pakistan, 1
to 1
hold 1
onto 1
a 1
fourth 1
of 1
Syria's 1
territory 1
in 1
alliance 1
with 1
Kurds? 1

The 0
U.S. 0
coalition 0
in 0
Syria 0
said 0
this 0
week 0
the 0
BSF 0
will 0
be 0
built 0
up 0
"over 0
the 0
next 0
several 0
years" 0
and 0
"be 0
stationed 0
along 0
the 0
borders 0
... 0
to 0
include 0
portions 0
of 0
the 0
Euphrates 0
river 0
valley 0
and 0
international 0
borders 0
to 0
the 0
east 0
and 0
north." 0

Remarkable: 0
A 0
U.S.-created 0
border 0
army 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
occupy 0
and 0
control 0
long 0
stretches 0
of 0
Syria's 0
borders 0
with 0
Turkey 0
and 0
Iraq, 0
over 0
Syria's 0
objections. 0

And 0
the 0
U.S. 0
military 0
will 0
stand 0
behind 0
the 0
BSF. 0

Are 1
the 1
2,000 1
U.S. 1
troops 1
in 1
Syria 1
really 1
up 1
to 1
that 1
task, 1
should 0
the 0
Turks 0
decide 0
to 0
cleanse 0
the 0
Syrian 0
border 0
of 0
Kurds, 0
or 0
should 0
the 0
Syrian 0
regime 0
decide 0
to 0
take 0
back 0
territory 0
occupied 0
by 0
the 0
Kurds? 0

Who 0
sanctioned 0
this 0
commitment 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
army, 0
which, 0
if 0
Syria 0
and 0
its 0
Russian 0
and 0
Iranian 0
allies, 0
and 0
the 0
Turks, 0
do 0
not 0
all 0
back 0
down, 0
risks 1
a 1
major 1
U.S. 1
war 1
with 1
no 1
allies 1
but 1
the 1
Kurds? 1

As 0
for 0
Syria's 0
Kurds 0
casting 0
their 0
lot 0
with 0
the 0
Americans, 0
one 0
wonders: 0
Did 0
they 0
not 0
observe 0
what 0
happened 0
when 0
their 0
Iraqi 0
cousins, 0
after 0
helping 0
us 0
drive 0
ISIS 0
out 0
of 0
Mosul, 0
were 0
themselves 0
driven 0
out 0
of 0
Kirkuk 0
by 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
army, 0
as 0
their 0
U.S. 0
allies 0
watched? 0

In 0
the 0
six-year 0
Syrian 0
civil 0
war, 0
which 0
may 0
be 0
about 0
to 0
enter 0
a 0
new 0
phase, 0
America 0
faces 0
a 0
familiar 0
situation. 0

While 0
our 0
"allies" 0
and 0
adversaries 0
have 0
vital 0
interests 0
there, 0
we 0
do 0
not. 0

The 0
Assads 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
power 0
for 0
the 0
lifetime 0
of 0
most 0
Americans. 0

And 0
we 0
Americans 0
have 0
never 0
shown 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
fight 0
there. 0

Assad 0
has 0
a 0
vital 0
interest: 0
preservation 0
of 0
his 0
family 0
regime 0
and 0
the 0
reunification 0
of 0
his 0
country. 0

The 0
Turks 0
have 0
a 0
vital 0
interest 0
in 0
keeping 0
armed 0
Kurds 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
border 0
regions 0
adjacent 0
to 0
their 0
own 0
Kurdish 0
minority, 0
which 0
seeks 0
greater 0
independence. 0

The 0
Israelis 0
and 0
Saudi 0
royals 0
want 0
the 0
U.S. 0
to 0
keep 0
Iran 0
from 0
securing 0
a 0
land 0
bridge 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Damascus 0
to 0
Lebanon. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
War 0
Party 0
wants 0
us 0
to 0
smash 0
Iran 0
and 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
forever 0
to 0
assure 0
the 0
hegemony 0
of 0
its 0
favorites. 0

Have 1
the 1
generals 1
taking 1
us 1
into 1
Syria 1
told 1
the 1
president 1
how 1
and 1
when, 1
if 1
ever, 1
they 1
plan 1
to 1
get 1
us 1
out? 1

In 0
2013, 0
Wilson 0
had 0
the 0
information 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
build 0
the 0
gun 0
removed 0
from 0
public 0
access 0
at 0
the 0
request 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
Department 0
of 0
Defense 0
Trade 0
Controls. 0

According 0
to 0
Wilson, 0
they 0
seized 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
information. 0

Clearly, 1
they 1
were 1
acting 1
unlawfully 1
when 1
they 1
did 1
what 1
they 1
did. 1

"I 0
thought 1
my 1
life 1
was 1
over," 1
Wilson 0
said 0
after 0
his 0
attorneys 0
told 0
him 0
he 0
didn't 0
fair 0
well 0
going 0
up 0
against 0
the 0
government. 0

So, 0
what 0
did 0
he 0
do? 0

He 0
fired 0
them, 0
and 0
got 0
a 0
new 0
legal 0
team. 0

Wired 0
has 0
the 0
story. 0

Instead, 0
Wilson 0
has 0
spent 0
the 0
last 0
years 0
on 0
an 0
unlikely 0
project 0
for 0
an 1
anarchist: 1
Not 0
simply 0
defying 0
or 0
skirting 0
the 0
law 0
but 0
taking 0
it 0
to 0
court 0
and 0
changing 0
it. 0

In 0
doing 0
so, 0
he 0
has 0
now 0
not 0
only 0
defeated 0
a 0
legal 0
threat 0
to 0
his 0
own 0
highly 0
controversial 0
gunsmithing 0
project. 0

He 0
may 0
have 0
also 0
unlocked 0
a 0
new 0
era 0
of 0
digital 0
DIY 0
gunmaking 0
that 0
further 0
undermines 0
gun 0
control 0
across 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
the 0
world—another 0
step 0
toward 0
Wilson's 0
imagined 0
future 0
where 0
anyone 1
can 1
make 1
a 1
deadly 1
weapon 1
at 1
home 1
with 1
no 1
government 1
oversight. 1

Two 0
months 0
ago, 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
quietly 0
offered 0
Wilson 0
a 0
settlement 0
to 0
end 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
he 0
and 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
co-plaintiffs 0
have 0
pursued 0
since 0
2015 0
against 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
government. 0

Wilson 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
of 0
lawyers 0
focused 0
their 0
legal 0
argument 0
on 0
a 0
free 0
speech 0
claim: 0
They 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
by 0
forbidding 0
Wilson 0
from 0
posting 0
his 0
3-D-printable 0
data, 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
was 0
not 0
only 0
violating 0
his 0
right 0
to 0
bear 0
arms 0
but 0
his 0
right 0
to 0
freely 0
share 0
information. 0

By 0
blurring 0
the 0
line 0
between 0
a 0
gun 0
and 0
a 0
digital 0
file, 0
Wilson 0
had 0
also 0
successfully 0
blurred 0
the 0
lines 0
between 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
and 0
the 0
First. 0

"If 0
code 0
is 0
speech, 0
the 0
constitutional 0
contradictions 0
are 0
evident," 0
Wilson 0
explained 0
to 0
WIRED 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
launched 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
in 0
2015. 0

"So 1
what 1
if 1
this 1
code 1
is 1
a 1
gun?” 1
The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice's 0
surprising 0
settlement, 0
confirmed 0
in 0
court 0
documents 0
earlier 0
this 0
month, 0
essentially 0
surrenders 0
to 0
that 0
argument. 0

It 0
promises 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
export 0
control 0
rules 0
surrounding 0
any 0
firearm 0
below 0
.50 0
caliber—with 0
a 0
few 0
exceptions 0
like 0
fully 0
automatic 0
weapons 0
and 0
rare 0
gun 0
designs 0
that 0
use 0
caseless 0
ammunition—and 0
move 0
their 0
regulation 0
to 0
the 0
Commerce 0
Department, 0
which 0
won't 0
try 0
to 0
police 0
technical 0
data 0
about 0
the 0
guns 0
posted 0
on 0
the 0
public 0
internet. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
it 0
gives 0
Wilson 0
a 0
unique 0
license 0
to 0
publish 0
data 0
about 0
those 0
weapons 0
anywhere 0
he 0
chooses. 0

"I 0
consider 0
it 0
a 0
truly 0
grand 0
thing," 0
Wilson 0
says. 0

"It 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
part 1
of 1
political 1
life 1
that 1
guns 1
are 1
downloadable, 1
and 1
we 1
helped 1
to 1
do 1
that." 1

BELLEVUE, 0
WA 0
– 0
The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
Foundation 0
have 0
reached 0
a 0
settlement 0
in 0
SAF’s 0
lawsuit 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Cody 0
Wilson 0
and 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
over 0
free 0
speech 0
issues 0
related 0
to 0
3-D 0
files 0
and 0
other 0
information 0
that 0
may 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
manufacture 0
lawful 0
firearms. 0

SAF 0
and 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
had 0
filed 0
suit 0
against 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
under 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration, 0
challenging 0
a 0
May 0
2013 0
attempt 0
to 0
control 0
public 0
speech 0
as 0
an 0
export 0
under 0
the 0
International 0
Traffic 0

(ITAR), 0
a 1
Cold 1
War-era 1
law 1
intended 1
to 1
control 1
exports 1
of 1
military 1
articles. 1

Under 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
settlement, 0
the 0
government 0
has 0
agreed 0
to 0
waive 0
its 0
prior 0

against 0
the 0
plaintiffs, 0
allowing 0
them 0
to 0
freely 0

the 0
3-D 0

other 0

at 0
issue. 0

The 0

a 0
significant 0
portion 0
of 0

as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0

Significantly, 0
the 0
government 0
expressly 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
non-automatic 0
firearms 0
up 0
to 0
.50-caliber 0
– 0
including 0
modern 0
semi-auto 0
sporting 0
rifles 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
popular 0
AR-15 0
and 0
similar 0

– 0
are 0
not 0
inherently 0
military. 0

“Not 0
only 0

this 0
a 0
First 0

it 0
also 0

and 0
Executive 0
Vice 0
President 0
Alan 0
M. 0

“For 0
years, 0
anti-gunners 0
have 0
contended 0
that 0
modern 0
semi-automatic 0

so-called 0
‘weapons 0
of 0

and 0
with 0
this 0
settlement, 0
the 0
government 0
has 0
acknowledged 0
they 0
are 0
nothing 0

“Under 0
this 0

he 0
continued, 0
“the 0
government 0

They 0
will 0

the 0
Commerce 0

which 0
does 0
not 0
impose 0

about 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0

control. 0

What 0
does 0
all 0
this 0
mean? 0

Well, 0
it's 0
pretty 0
simple, 0
and 1
I 1
highly 1
recommend 1
the 1
Wired 1
article, 1
which 1
is 1
quite 1
lengthy 1
and 1
has 1
lots 1
of 1
information, 1
but 0
what 0
this 0
does 0
is 0
demonstrates 0
that 0
the 1
genie 1
is 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
bottle 1
and 0
there 0
is 0
just 0
no 0
way 0
for 0
gun 1
grabbing 1
Communists 1
the 0
world 0
over 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
truly 0
enforce 0
their 0
unlawful 0
acts 0
of 0
fun 1
gun 1
confiscation. 1

Why? 0

Because 0
now, 0
anyone 0
with 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
internet 0
and 0
a 0
3D 0
printer 0
can 0
print 0
their 0
very 0
own 0
gun 0
that 0
is 0
unregistered. 0

That's 0
right, 0
and 0
it's 0
perfectly 0
legal 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

And 0
we 0
aren't 0
just 0
talking 0
a 0
rigid 0
looking 0
one-shot 0
handgun. 0

We're 0
talking 0
ARs, 0
1911s 0
and 0
a 0
host 0
of 0
other 0
guns. 0

This 0
actually 0
may 0
end 0
up 0
undermining 0
the 0
gun 0
manufacturing 0
industry 0
in 0
the 0
future, 0
as 0
people 0
will 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
build 0
their 0
own 0
guns 0
at 0
home 0
in 0
a 0
similar 0
manner 0
to 0
how 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
had 0
a 0
dramatic 0
effect 0
on 0
the 0
retail 0
brick 0
and 0
mortar 0
stores. 0

Wilson 0
boasted 1
that 0
his 1
efforts 1
have 1
officially 1
killed 1
gun 1
control. 1

"I 0
barely 1
put 1
a 1
million 1
bucks 1
into 1
this 1
and 1
I 1
got 1
you 1
the 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
forever," 1
he 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Wire 0
in 0
a 0
phone 0
interview. 0

"What 1
has 1
the 1
NRA 1
done 1
for 1
you 1
lately?" 1

I 0
don't 0
know 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
go 0
quite 0
that 0
far, 0
after 0
all, 0
the 0
settlement 0
does 0
state 0
that 0
"the 0
government 0
expressly 0
acknowledges 0
that 0
non-automatic 0
firearms 0
up 0
to 0
.50-caliber 0
– 0
including 0
modern 0
semi-auto 0

as 0
the 0
popular 0
AR-15 0
and 0
similar 0
firearms 0
– 0
are 0
not 0
inherently 0
military." 0

Therefore, 0
the 0
government 0
still 0
believes 0
it 0
has 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
regulate 0
certain 0
arms, 0
which 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
authority 0
to 0
do. 0

"This 0
doesn’t 0
put 0
the 0
rifle 0
in 0
everyone’s 0
hand, 0
but 0
it 0
does 0
that 0
in 0
essence" 0
he 0
added. 0

"The 1
DNA 1
of 1
our 1
culture 1
is 1
preserved. 1

This 1
is 1
the 1
first 1
pillar 1
in 1
the 1
internet 1
gun 1
culture 1
of 1
tomorrow, 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
permanent." 1

This 1
is 1
a 1
huge 1
milestone 1
in 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
our 1
county, 1
and 0
as 0
such, 0
it 0

Cruz 0
then 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
call 0
the 0
situation 0
a 0
tragedy 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
jury 0
of 0
her 0
peers 0
finds 0
she 0
did 0
something 0
wrong 0
then 0
Guyger 0
should 0
suffer 0
the 0
consequences. 0

To 0
be 0
clear, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
admitted 0
to 0
doing 0
something 0
wrong. 0

While 0
controversy 0
swarms 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
why 0
she 0
may 0
have 0
killed 0
Jean, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
kill 0
him. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

This 0
public 0
servant 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
innocent 1
man’s 0
home 0
and 0
shot 0
him 0
dead. 0

Because 0
of 0
her 0
actions, 0
this 0
man 0
no 0
longer 0
lives. 0

That, 0
Senator 0
Ted 0
Cruz, 0
is 0
wrong. 0

Mistake 0
or 0
not, 0
she 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man. 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
to 0
blame 0
and 0
yet 0
she 0
is 0
still 0
collecting 0
a 0
paycheck 0
from 0
taxpayers. 0

Calling 0
for 0
Gugyer 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
calling 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
for 0
making 0
stupid 0
Instagram 0
posts 0
or 0
saying 0
stupid 0
things—she 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
she 0
should 0
be 0
fired 0
from 0
her 0
job 0
which 0
gave 0
her 0
the 0
gun 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

What 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
is 0
doing 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
their 0
apologists 0
are 0
doing. 0

They 0
are 0
treating 0
Guyger 0
differently 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
system. 0

In 0
Cruz’s 0
eyes, 0
Guyger 0
going 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
that 0
wasn’t 0
her’s 0
and 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
was 0
simply 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
being 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
place 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
time—a 0
tragic 0
mistake 0
that 0
ruined 0
two 0
lives, 0
according 0
to 0
Cruz. 0

But 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
case 0
at 0
all. 0

Would 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
and 0
police 0
officers 0
be 0
following 0
this 0
same 0
narrative 0
if 0
the 0
roles 0
were 0
reversed? 0

If 0
it 0
was 0
Botham 0
Jean, 0
a 1
black 1
man, 1
walking 0
into 0
the 0
apartment 0
of 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
a 0
white 1
female 1
cop, 1
and 0
killing 0
her—would 0
police 0
and 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
simply 0
write 0
it 0
off 0
as 0
a 0
tragic 0
accident? 0

Of 0
course, 0
we 0
know 0
the 0
answer 0
to 0
that 0
question 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
resounding, 0
NO. 0

To 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
peanut 0
gallery 0
before 0
it 0
begins, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
some 0
case 0
of 0
Democrat 0
versus 0
Republican 0
or 0
right 0
versus 0
left. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
right 0
versus 0
wrong, 0
and 0
what 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
did 0
to 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
was 0
wrong. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
way 0
around 0
it, 0
“mistake” 0
or 0
not. 0

From 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
this 0
case, 0
law 0
enforcement 0
have 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
protect 0
Guyger 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
blue 0
line. 0

Amber 0
Guyger’s 0
home 0
was 0
never 0
searched 0
while 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
was 0
searched 0
that 0
night. 0

The 0
results 0
of 0
the 0
blood 0
test 0
to 0
test 0
for 0
alcohol 0
or 0
drugs 0
in 0
her 0
system 0
were 0
never 0
released, 0
yet 0
police 0
— 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
his 0
mother 0
buried 0
her 0
son 0
— 0
claimed 0
they 0
found 0
marijuana 0
in 0
his 0
house. 0

It’s 0
been 0
a 0
smear 0
campaign 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
this 0
way 0
by 0
design. 0

Amber 0
Guyger 0
took 0
an 0
innocent 1
person’s 0
life, 0
and 0
because 0
people 0
are 0
so 0
blinded 0
by 0
the 0
badge, 0
she 0
is 0
being 0
portrayed 0
as 0
the 0
victim. 0

To 0
those 0
who 0
attempt 0
to 0
claim 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
bias 0
in 0
this 0
horrifically 1
flawed 0
system, 0
if 0
ever 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
case 0
to 0
prove 0
you 0
wrong—this 0
is 0
it. 0

A 0
tragedy 0
indeed. 0

O’Malley, 0
the 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Boston, 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
statement 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
had 0
“given 0
much 0
prayerful 1
consideration” 1
to 0
the 0
membership 0
of 0
the 0
panel. 0

“The 0
newly 0
appointed 0
members 0
will 0
add 0
to 0
the 0
Commission’s 0
global 0
perspective 0
in 0
the 0
protection 0
of 0
minors 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
adults,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“The 0
Holy 0
Father 0
has 0
ensured 0
continuity 0
in 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
our 0
Commission, 0
which 0
is 0
to 0
assist 0
local 0
churches 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
in 0
their 0
efforts 0
to 0
safeguard 0
all 0
children, 0
young 0
people, 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
adults 0
from 0
harm.” 0

Local 0
survivors 0
of 0
abuse 0
greeted 0
the 0
announcement 0
warily, 0
hopeful 0
that 0
there 0
could 0
be 0
positive 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
but 0
saying 0
the 0
panel 0
accomplished 0
little 0
under 0
its 0
first 0
three-year 0
mandate. 0

“The 0
objectives 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
when 0
it 0
was 0
first 0
announced, 0
when 0
it 0
was 0
just 0
getting 0
started. 0

an 0

survivor 0
who 0
founded 0
the 0
New 0
England 0
chapter 0
of 0
the 0
Survivors 0

Saviano 0
said 0
the 0
commission 0
is 0
“a 0
good 0
idea,” 0
and 0
added, 0
“I’m 0
not 0
particularly 0
optimistic 0
that 0
much 0
will 0
get 0
accomplished, 0
but 0
a 0
commission 0
is 0
better 0
than 0
no 0
commission.” 0

Given 0
his 0
long 0
experience 0
witnessing 0
the 1
church’s 1
inertia 1
on 1
the 1
issue, 1
Saviano 0
said, 0
he 1
has 1
set 1
his 1
expectations 1
at 1
rock 1
bottom. 1

“That’s 0
kind 0
of 0
my 0
attitude 0
now: 0
If 1
I 1
don’t 1
expect 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
to 1
do 1
anything, 1
then 1
I 1
won’t 1
be 1
too 1
disappointed 1
when 1
they 1
don’t 1
do 1
anything,” 1
he 0
continued. 0

Jim 0
Scanlan, 0
another 0
survivor, 0
said 0
“the 0
timing 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
too 0
perfect” 0
given 0
the 0
controversy 0
last 0
month 0
surrounding 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
remarks 0
that 0
accused 0
victims 0
of 0
a 0
notorious 1
Chilean 1
pedophile 1
priest, 1
the 0
Rev. 0

Fernando 0
Karadima, 0
of 0
“slander” 1
against 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros, 0
who 0
the 0
victims 0
say 0
was 0
complicit 0
in 0
a 0
cover 0
up. 0

The 0
pope 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
seen 0
no 0
proof 0
of 0
Barros’s 0
guilt, 0
but 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
reported 0
that 0
O’Malley 0
and 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
had 0
in 0
2015 0
hand-delivered 0
to 0
him 0
an 0
eight-page 0
letter 0
from 0
a 0

that 0
graphically 0
detailed 0
his 0
abuse 0

said 0
Barros 0

other 0
clergy 0
had 0
witnessed 0
him 0
being 0
fondled 0

Scanlan 0
said 0
his 0
reaction 0
to 0
hearing 0
that 0
Francis 0
has 0
revived 0
the 0
commission 0
was 0
“hopeful 0
but 0
cynical.” 0
Like 0
Saviano, 0
he 0
said 0
the 0
panel 0
accomplished 0
little 0
in 0
its 0
first 0
incarnation. 0

“My 0
expectation 0
is 0
it 0
will 0
probably 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
outcome, 0
because 0
the 0
church 0
is 0
the 0
church, 0
and 0
they 0
do 0
it 0
for 0
appearance, 0
but 0
they’re 0
still 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
by 0
their 0
own 0
rules,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“I’ve 1
seen 1
little 1
that 1
has 1
changed.” 1

Scanlan 0
said 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
given 0
him 0
hope 0
for 0
progress 0
on 0
some 0
issues 0
in 0
the 0
church, 0
but 0
on 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
he 0
“continues 1
to 1
be 1
blind 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
church 1
has 1
done.” 1

Last 0
month, 0
O’Malley 0
denounced 0
the 0
pope’s 0
controversial 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishop. 0

Despite 0
distancing 0
himself 0
from 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
comments, 0
O’Malley 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
witnessed 0
the 0
pontiff’s 0
genuine 0
compassion 0
for 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

“The 0
Pope’s 0
statements 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
place 0
in 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
would 0
abuse 0

and 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
adhere 0
to 0
zero 0
tolerance 0
for 0

Yesterday’s 0
State 0
of 0
the 0
Union 0
address 0
issued 0
by 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
represented 0
a 0
refreshing 0
break 0
from 0
the 0
eight 0
years 0
of 0
pusillanimous 1
foreign 0
policies 0
pursued 0
by 0
past 0
administration. 0

Nowhere 0
was 0
this 0
more 0
evident 0
than 0
in 0
the 0
manner 0
in 0
which 0
Trump 0
described 0
Iran’s 0
repressive 0
regime 0
and 0
attempts 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
people 0
to 0
overthrow 0
it 0
through 0
peaceful 0
protest. 0

When 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
governing 0
authorities, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
is 0
under 0
no 0
illusions 0
about 0
the 1
nefarious 1
nature 1
of 1
this 1
fascist 1
theocracy. 1

“We 0
are 0
restoring 0
clarity 0
about 0
our 0
adversaries,” 0
Trump 0
stated 0
in 0
a 0
not 0
too 0
subtle 0
jibe 0
at 0
his 0
predecessor 0
who 0
seemed 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
a 0
perpetual 0
state 0
of 0
confusion 0
about 0
who 0
his 0
friends 0
and 0
enemies 0
were. 0

Trump 0
also 0
referenced 0
the 0
recent 0
widespread 0
Iranian 0
protests, 0
crushed 0
with 0
extreme 0
ruthlessness 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
Revolutionary 0
Guard 0
Corps 0
and 0
its 0
Basij 0
auxiliary 0
militia. 0

“When 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
rose 0
up 0
against 0
the 0
crimes 0
of 0
a 0
corrupt 0
dictatorship,” 0
he 0
stated, 0
“I 0
did 0
not 0
stay 0
silent. 0

America 1
stands 1
with 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
Iran 1
in 1
their 1
courageous 1
struggle 1
for 1
freedom.” 1

By 0
contrast, 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
and 0
his 0
obsequious 1
acolytes 1
were 0
besotted 0
by 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
forging 0
détente 0
with 0
the 0
despotic 1
mullahs 1
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic. 0

His 0
administration 0
remained 0
largely 0
silent 0
when 0
Iranians 0
took 0
to 0
the 0
streets 0
in 0
2009 0
to 0
protest 0
a 0
rigged 0
election. 0

Some 0
have 0
speculated 0
that 0
his 0
administration 0
missed 0
out 0
on 0
a 0
prime 0
opportunity 0
for 0
regime 0
change. 0

It 0
was 0
only 0
downhill 0
from 0
there. 0

In 0
a 0
misguided 1
effort 1
to 0
secure 0
Iran’s 0
willingness 0
to 0
sign 0
the 0
Joint 0
Comprehensive 0
Plan 0
of 0
Action, 0
Obama 1
sold 1
everything 1
including 1
the 1
kitchen 1
sink. 1

He 0
tried 0
selling 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
naïve 0
notion 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
moderate 0
elements 0
of 0
import 0
in 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
obvious 0
fact 0
that 0
all 0
authority 0
in 0
Iran 0
is 0
vested 0
with 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Leader, 0
Ayatollah 0
Khamenei, 0
and 0
his 0
IRGC 0
henchmen. 0

The 0
tried 0
and 0
true 0
concept 0
of 0
peace 0
through 0
strength 0
gave 0
way 0
to 0
fecklessness 1
through 1
appeasement. 1

Ransom 0
payments 0
to 0
the 0
tune 0
of 0
$1.7 0
billion 0
were 0
transferred 0
to 0
Iran. 0

Promising 0
criminal 0
investigations 0
targeting 0
Iran’s 0
chief 0
terror 0
proxy, 0
Hezbollah, 0
were 0
shut 0
down. 0

Targeted 0
liquidation 0
operations 0
by 0
our 0
Israeli 0
allies 0
against 0
Iranian 0
Quds 0
Force 0
leaders 0
were 0
foiled 0
after 0
Obama 0
tipped 0
off 0
Tehran 0
on 0
Israel’s 0
intentions. 0

Iranian 0
material 0
breaches 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
were 0
all 0
but 0
ignored 0
while 0
Iran’s 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
program 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
proceed 0
at 0
full 0
speed 0
despite 0
being 0
in 0
defiance 0
of 0
United 0
Nations 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolution 0
2231. 0

Obama’s 0
near 0
messianic 1
zealotry 1
in 0
his 0
interactions 0
with 0
the 0
mullahs 0
severely 0
compromised 0
America’s 0
national 0
security 0
and 0
weakened 0
its 0
image 0
on 0
the 0
international 0
stage. 0

Worse, 0
it 0
emboldened 0
the 0
mullahs 0
(appeasement 0
tends 0
to 0
do 0
that) 0
who 0
seemed 0
to 0
revel 0
in 0
Obama’s 1
groveling. 1

Iran’s 0
mischief-making 1
extends 0
far 0
and 0
wide 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
where 0
friction 0
between 0
the 0
IRGC 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
Navy 0
remains 0
constant. 0

Iran 0
regards 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
as 0
its 0
domain 0
and 0
but 0
for 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
5th 0
Fleet, 0
would 0
have 0
full 0
reign 0
over 0
its 0
waters, 0
which 0
include 0
the 0
strategic 0
Strait 0
of 0
Hormuz. 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
securing 0
the 0
Gulf, 0
the 0
5th 0
Fleet 0
serves 0
as 0
a 0
constant 0
reminder 0
to 0
the 0
Iranians 0
of 0
their 0
impotence. 0

But 0
the 0
deterrent 1
effect 1
of 0
the 0
Navy’s 0
5th 0
Fleet, 0
and 0
for 0
that 0
matter 0
America’s 0
military 0
might, 0
is 0
only 0
as 0
effective 0
as 0
the 0
political 0
leadership 0
that 0
commands 0
it, 0
and 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
as 0
Commander 0
in 0
Chief 0
of 0
the 0
armed 0
forces 0
did 0
little 0
to 0
instill 0
fear 0
or 0
project 0
deterrence. 0

On 0
the 0
contrary, 0
the 0
Iranians 0
correctly 0
viewed 0
him 0
as 0
weak, 1
indecisive 1
and 1
ineffectual. 1

On 0
his 0
watch, 0
American 0
warships 0
patrolling 0
the 0
Gulf 0
were 0
harried 0
by 0
armed 0
IRGC 0
speed 0
boats 0
and 0
larger 0
navy 0
frigates 0
with 0
near 0
impunity. 0

At 0
times 0
Iranian 0
naval 0
vessels 0
closed 0
to 0
within 0
600 0
to 0
150 0
yards 0
of 0
American 0
warships. 0

The 0
navy 0
termed 0
these 0
near 0
ritualistic, 1
belligerent 1
encounters, 1
“unsafe 0
and 0
unprofessional.” 0

Iranian 0
arrogance 0
and 0
impudence 0
reached 0
its 0
zenith 0
with 0
the 0
January 0
12th 0
2016 0
seizure 0
of 0
two 0
American 0
riverine 0
command 0
boats 0
and 0
their 0
crews 0
near 0
Farsi 0
Island. 0

The 0
RCBs 0
and 0
crews 0
manning 0
them 0
were 0
returned 0
some 0
16 0
hours 0
later 0
but 0
not 0
before 0
the 0
Iranians 0
stole 0
two 0
satellite 0
phone 0
sim 0
cards, 0
likely 0
containing 0
classified 0
information, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
thousands 0
of 0
pages 0
of 0
information 0
downloaded 0
from 0
laptops, 0
GPS 0
devices 0
and 0
maps 0
used 0
by 0
the 0
sailors. 0

Ironically, 0
the 0
seizure 0
occurred 0
on 0
the 0
very 0
day 0
that 0
Obama 0
was 0
to 0
give 0
his 0
State 0
of 0
the 0
Union 0
address 0
but 0
predictably, 0
he 1
didn’t 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
seizure 1
of 1
Americans 1
was 1
important 1
enough 1
to 1
note. 1

But 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Navy, 0
the 0
past 0
five 0
months 0
have 0
witnessed 0
markedly 0
less 0
belligerent 0
conduct 0
from 0
the 0
Iranians, 0
leaving 0
Navy 0
officials 0
baffled 0
by 0
the 0
sudden 0
positive 0
change 0
in 0
attitude. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Iran’s 0
attitude 0
adjustment 0
in 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
is 0
no 0
mystery 0
and 0
stems 0
from 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
implementation 0
of 0
a 0
new 0
robust 0
foreign 0
policy 0
vis-à-vis 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic. 0

Soon 0
after 0
taking 0
office, 0
Trump 0
noted 0
that 0
“Iran 0
[was] 0
playing 0
with 0
fire” 0
and 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
as 0
“kind” 0
to 0
the 0
mullahs 0
as 0
Obama 0
was. 0

This 0
wasn’t 0
empty 1
rhetoric. 1

It 0
was 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
tangible 0
action. 0

Additional 0
sanctions 0
were 0
imposed 0
against 0
Iran 0
for 0
acting 0
in 0
defiance 0
of 0
UNSCR 0
2231. 0

Sanctions 0
were 0
also 0
imposed 0
against 0
the 0
IRGC 0
for 0
supporting 0
terrorism. 0

Trump’s 0
DOJ 0
revived 0
and 0
breathed 0
new 0
life 0
into 0
Project 0
Cassandra, 0
a 0
promising 0
anti-Hezbollah/IRGC 0
law 0
enforcement 0
initiative 0
shelved 0
by 0
Obama. 0

Most 0
importantly, 0
Trump 0
failed 0
to 0
certify 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
noting 0
material 0
Iranian 0
breaches, 0
and 0
has 0
threatened 0
to 0
abrogate 0
the 0
deal 0
in 0
its 0
entirety 0
unless 0
modifications 0
are 0
implemented. 0

Those 0
modifications 0
would 0
include 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
absurd 0
sunset 0
clauses 0
in 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
and 0
tough 0
restrictions 0
on 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
testing. 0

The 0
mullahs 0
have 0
become 0
cognizant 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 1
new 1
sheriff 1
in 1
town, 1
one 0
that 0
backs 0
up 0
tough 0
talk 0
with 0
action 0
and 0
doesn’t 1
ask 1
“how 1
high” 1
when 1
they 1
say 1
“jump.” 1
Clearly, 1
the 0
IRGC’s 0
new 0
docile 1
posture 1
in 0
the 0
Arabian 0
Gulf 0
is 0
a 0
direct 0
consequence 0
of 0
this 0
realization. 0

founded 0
to 0

These 0

Voice 0
for 0
Peace: 0
an 0
anti-Israel 1

that 0

which 0
sponsored 0
talks 0
by 0
an 0
anti-Semite 0
who 0
accused 1

The 0
fruits 0
of 0
the 0
AJHS 0
and 0
JVP 0
partnership 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
events 0
attacking 0
Israel. 0

Coming 0
up 0
in 0
late 0
October 0
is 0
“The 0
Balfour 0
Declaration: 0
Support 0
for 0
a 0
Jewish 0
Homeland 0
or 0
Jewish 0
State?” 0

The 0
two 0
speakers 0
are 0
Robert 0
Herbst, 0
the 0
coordinator 0
of 0
the 0
Westchester 0
chapter 0
of 0
JVP, 0
and 0
Jonathan 0
Kuttab, 0
who 0
advocates 0
a 0
one-state 0
solution 0
for 0
eliminating 0
Israel. 0

He 0
had 0
tweeted, 0
"EU 1
no 1
longer 1
considers 1
#Hamas 1
a 1
terrorist 1
group. 1

Time 1
for 1
US 1
to 1
do 1
same." 1

Kuttab 0
has 0
defended 0
Islamic 0
anti-Semitism 0
by 0
claiming 0
that 0
the 0
“distrust 0
Moslems 0
feel 0
towards 0
Jews” 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
“two 0
acts 0
of 0
betrayal 0
by 0
Jewish 0
tribes 0
against 0
the 0
Prophet.” 0
And 0
that 0
Jews 0
suffer 0
from 0
a 0
“Holocaust 1
Syndrome” 1
of 1
entitlement. 1

He 0
justified 0
hijacking 0
planes, 0
described 0
suicide 0
bombers 0
as 0
“taking 0
the 0
supreme 0
sacrifice” 0
and 0
defended 0
Hezbollah 1
as 1
“an 1
armed-resistance 1
movement” 1

He 0
has 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
"Jewish 0
community 0
gradually 0
consolidated 0
its 0
power, 0
wealth, 0
and 0
influence 0
in 0
all 0
sectors 0
of 0
society" 0
especially 0
in 0
"crucial 0
sectors 0
like 0
banking, 0
finance, 0
media” 0
where 0
"their 0
influence 0
both 0
as 0
individuals 0
and 0
an 0
organized 0
community 0
far 0
exceeded 0
their 0
numbers" 0
and 0
that 0
their 0
power 0
strengthens 0
“conspiracy 0
theories 0
about 0
‘Jewish 0
control’ 0
that 0
are 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
the 0
infamous 0
“’Protocols 0
of 0
the 0
Elders 0
of 0
Zion.’” 0

Robert 0
Herbst 0
and 0
Jonathan 0
Kuttab 0
are 0
both 0
supporters 0
of 0
a 0
one-state 0
plan 0
for 0
eliminating 0
Israel. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
is 0
co-sponsoring 0
a 0
JVP 0
anti-Israel 0
event 0
by 0
two 0
opponents 0
of 0
Israel, 0
one 0
of 0
whom 0
has 0
defended 0
Hamas. 0

An 0
organization 0
that 0
hands 0
out 0
the 0
Emma 0
Lazarus 0
Award, 0
named 0
after 0
a 0
passionate 0
Zionist, 0
at 0
its 0
posh 0
dinners 0
is 0
hosting 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
Israel. 0

The 0
“Jewish 0
Homeland” 0
or 0
“Jewish 0
State” 0
argument 0
is 0
a 0
hook 0
for 0
contending 0
that 0
the 0
Balfour 0
Declaration 0
didn’t 0
endorse 0
Israel, 0
but 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
Jewish 0
Bantustan 0
within 0
a 0
Muslim 0
country. 0

That 0
worked 0
so 0
well 0
for 0
the 0
Christians 0
and 0
Jews 0
of 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
co-sponsoring 0
a 0
one-state 0
event 0
by 0
an 0
anti-Israel 0
hate 0
group. 0

But 0
it’s 0
also 0
hosting 0
it 0
at 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History’s 0
headquarters. 0

AJHS 0
is 0
a 0
component 0
of 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History. 0

And 0
the 0
partnership 0
between 0
AJHS 0
and 0
JVP 0
sheds 0
light 0
on 0
the 0
controversy 0
over 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
David 0
N. 0
Myers, 0
an 0
anti-Israel 0
activist, 0
to 0
head 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History. 0

During 0
the 0
Myers 0
controversy, 0
the 0
Center 0
took 0
pains 0
to 0
disassociate 0
Myers 0
and 0
themselves 0
from 0
JVP 0
because 0
a 0
JVP 0
handout 0
had 0
listed 0
him 0
as 0
a 0
“JVP 0
Academic 0
Advisory 0
Board 0
Member.” 0
But 0
in 0
reality 0
the 0
Center, 0
through 0
AJHS, 0
has 0
an 0
ongoing 0
relationship 0
with 0
JVP. 0

The 0
Balfour 0
event 0
was 0
not 0
AJHS’ 0
only 0
partnership 0
with 0
JVP. 0

In 0
December, 0
the 0
AJHS 0
will 0
feature 0
“Rubble 0
Rubble”, 0
a 0
play 0
by 0
Dan 0
Fishback 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
trip 0
to 0
Israel. 0

Fishback 0
is 0
a 0
BDS 0
supporter 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
JVP 0
Artists 0
Council. 0

His 0
goal 0
is 0
to 0
“normalize 0
Jewish 0
anti-Zionism”. 0

AJHS 0
and 0
JVP 0
members 0
get 0
discounted 0
admission. 0

The 0
venue 0
is 0
once 0
again 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History. 0

Specifically 0
the 0
Leo 0
and 0
Julia 0
Forchheimer 0
Auditorium 0
at 0
CJH. 0

Leo 0
Forchheimer’s 0
philanthropy 0
had 0
left 0
its 0
mark 0
on 0
Israel. 0

What 0
would 0
he 0
think 0
if 0
he 0
knew 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
purposes 0
that 0
CJH 0
is 0
putting 0
his 0
gift 0
to? 0

A 0
third 0
AJHS-JVP 0
event 0
featured 0
Efrat 0
Yerday, 0
an 1
anti-Israel 1
activist, 0
accusing 0
Israel 0
of 0
racism. 0

Efrat 0
has 0
claimed 0
that, 0
"Zionism 1
does 1
not 1
only 1
dispossess 1
Palestinians, 1
but 1
it 1
also 1
dispossesses 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
sophisticated 1
way, 1
non-white 1
Jews. 1

Being 1
Jewish 1
is 1
highly 1
identified 1
with 1
being 1
white 1
because 1
of 1
Zionism." 1

AJHS 0
will 0
claim 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
only 0
offering 0
different 0
perspectives. 0

But 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Israel, 0
there’s 0
only 0
one 0
perspective. 0

“Balfour” 0
and 0
“Rubble 0
Rubble” 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
part 0
of 0
AJHS’ 0
“1917: 0
How 0
One 0
Year 0
Changed 0
the 0
World”. 0

The 0
exhibition 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
cover 0
WWI, 0
the 0
Bolshevik 0
Revolution, 0
and 0
the 0
Balfour 0
Declaration. 0

But 0
the 0
only 0
Balfour 0
program 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
questions 0
whether 0
Israel 0
should 0
even 0
exist. 0

The 0
exhibition 0
closes 0
with 0
Fishback’s 0
anti-Israel 0
agenda. 0

And 0
these 0
are 0
the 0
only 0
listed 0
AJHS 0
programs 0
that 0
focus 0
on 0
Israel. 0

JVP 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
only 0
organization 0
that 0
AJHS 0
chooses 0
to 0
partner 0
with 0
on 0
political 0
events. 0

The 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
uninterested 0
in 0
holding 0
any 0
pro-Israel 0
events. 0

It’s 0
uninterested 0
in 0
partnering 0
with 0
pro-Israel 0
groups. 0

Instead 0
it’s 0
providing 0
a 0
forum 0
for 0
a 0
BDS 0
hate 0
group. 0

And 0
it’s 0
no 0
mystery 0
why. 0

The 0
AJHS 0
Academic 0

When 0
we 0
look 0
at 0
what 0
is 0
going 0
on 0
in 0
CJH’s 0
components 0
like 0
the 0
AJHS, 0
the 0
elevation 0
of 0
David 0
N. 0
Myers 0
to 0
head 0
CJH 0
is 0
unsurprising. 0

Myers 0
is 0
a 0
symptom 0
of 0
the 0
problem. 0

As 0
is 0
AJHS’s 0
partnership 0
with 0
JVP. 0

A 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
shocking 0
behavior 0
is 0
taking 0
place 0
inside 0
Jewish 0
organizations 0
whose 0
inner 0
workings 0
most 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
Jewish 0
community 0
generally 0
pay 0
very 0
little 0
attention 0
to. 0

Unlike 0
CJH, 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
is 0
an 0
organization 0
that 0
dates 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
19th 0
century. 0

Its 1
perversion 1
by 0
the 0
radical 0
anti-Jewish 0
and 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
to 0
serve 0
anti-Semitic 0
narratives 0
is 0
tragic. 0

And 0
yet 0
it’s 0
inescapable. 0

Even 0
as 0
the 0
Myers 0
scandal 0
continues 0
to 0
simmer, 1
the 0
AJHS 0
partnership 0
with 0
JVP 0
is 0
making 0
the 0
choice 0
painfully 0
clear. 0

The 0
radical 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
satisfied 0
with 0
embedding 0
“moderate” 0
opposing 0
voices 0
into 0
Jewish 0
organizations. 0

Instead 0
it 0
seeks 0
to 0
normalize 0
the 0
furthest 0
extremes 0
of 0
anti-Israel 0
hatred. 0

And 0
it 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
satisfied 0
with 0
anything 0
less. 0

During 0
the 0
Myers 0
controversy, 0
defenders 0
of 0
his 0
appointment, 0
including 0
some 0
figures 0
named 0
here, 0
claimed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
issue 0
of 0
apolitical 0
scholarship. 0

Is 0
co-sponsoring 0
events 0
with 0
a 0
hate 0
group 0
that 0
has 0
sponsored 0
talks 0
by 0
a 0
woman 0
who 0
accused 1
Jews 1
of 1
drinking 1
blood 1
also 0
apolitical 0
scholarship? 0

The 0
anti-Israel 0
leftists 0
at 0
the 0
AJHS 0
are 0
clearly 0
not 0
leaving 0
their 0
politics 0
at 0
home. 0

And 0
support 0
for 0
them 0
and 0
for 0
Myers 0
cannot 0
be 0
distinguished 0
from 0
support 0
for 0
their 0
views. 0

Not 0
when 0
JVP 0
is 0
at 0
AJHS. 0

We 1
all 1
have 1
choices 1
to 1
make. 1

Sometimes 0
the 0
choices 0
are 0
murky. 0

Other 0
times 0
they 0
are 0
simple 0
and 0
easy. 0

When 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society 0
hosts 0
and 0
co-sponsors 0
an 0
event 0
by 0
a 0
BDS 0
hate 0
group 0
attacking 0
the 0
existence 0
of 0
Israel 0
and 0
featuring 0
a 0
speaker 0
who 0
had 0
defended 0
terrorism 0
and 0
anti-Semitism, 0
the 0
choice 0
becomes 0
easy. 0

Either 1
you 1
stand 1
with 1
BDS, 1
Hamas, 1
blood 1
libels 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
want 1
to 1
destroy 1
Israel 1
or 1
with 1
Jews. 1

As 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
radicalism 0
of 0
the 0
left 0
grows, 0
such 0
choices 0
will 0
become 0
even 0
more 0
obscenely 0
simple. 0

But 0
they 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
any 0
less 0
difficult. 0

Opposing 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
makes 0
many 0
important 0
enemies 0
and 0
wins 0
few 0
friends. 0

The 0
anti-Israel 0
left 0
has 0
built 0
networks 0
that 0
can 0
blacklist, 0
smear 0
and 0
silence 0
almost 0
anyone 0
in 0
an 0
academic 0
field. 0

Speaking 0
out 0
against 0
hate 0
is 0
easiest 0
when 0
it’s 0
weakest. 0

It’s 0
hardest 0
when 0
it’s 0
strongest. 0

When 0
we 0
think 0
about 0
Nazi 0
Germany, 0
we 0
remember 0
those 0
who 0
spoke 0
out. 0

We 0
don’t 0
remember 0
those 0
who 0
were 0
too 0
intimidated 0
and 0
uncertain 0
to 0
rise 0
against 0
anti-Semitism 0
when 0
they 0
saw 0
it 0
and 0
heard 0
it. 0

History 0
tells 0
us 0
why 0
so 0
many 0
people 0
are 0
afraid 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
right 0
thing 0
when 0
it 0
counts. 0

It 0
also 0
tells 0
us 0
how 0
irrelevant 0
history 0
makes 0
them. 0

There 0
are 0
lessons 0
here 0
for 0
the 0
Center 0
for 0
Jewish 0
History 0
and 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society, 0
for 0
those 0
on 0
the 0
inside 0
who 0
see 0
the 0
corruption 0
of 0
their 0
organizations 0
every 0
day 0
and 0
for 0
those 0
on 0
the 0
outside 0
who 0
are 0
worried 0
about 0
speaking 0
up. 0

There 0
are 0
lessons 0
here 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
us. 0

If 0
you 0
can’t 0
speak 0
out 0
against 0
the 0
American 0
Jewish 0
Historical 0
Society’s 0
partnership 0
with 0
a 0
hate 0
group 0
linked 0
to 0
a 0
literal 0
blood 0
libels 0
and 0
a 0
speaker 0
who 0
defends 0
Hamas, 0
when 0
will 0
your 0
voice 0
be 0
heard? 0

Tea 0
With 0
the 0
Curate: 0
The 0
Attack 0
on 0
Marriage 0
is 0
an 0
Attack 0
on 0
Christ 0
in 0
the 0
Eucharist 0

Pope 0
Paul 0
VI’s 0
1965 0
encyclical 0
on 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
“Mysterium 0
Fidei,” 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
I 0
saw 0
anyone 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
body 0
and 0
blood, 0
soul 0
and 0
complete 0
divinity 0
of 0
Christ 0
was 0
actually 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
consecrated 0
species. 0

Having 0
been 0
raised 0
in 0
Remi 0
de 0
Roo’s 0
Victoria 0
in 0
the 0
1970s, 0
I 0
had 0
naturally 0
never 0
heard 0
anything 0
at 0
all 0
about 0
the 0
Eucharist. 0

The 0
understanding 0
that 0
Catholics 0
believed 0
what 0
they 0
believe 0
about 0
it 0
came 0
as 0
a 0
bit 0
of 0
a 0
shock. 0

(Read 0
the 0
full 0
document 0
here. 0
) 0

With 0
the 0
hindsight 0
of 0
52 0
years 0
and 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
very 1
dirty 1
and 1
unappealing 1
water 1
under 1
the 1
Catholic 1
bridge, 1
we 0
can 0
see 0
it 0
as 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
warning 0
prophecy. 0

Published 0
just 0
three 0
months 0
before 0
the 0
close 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II 0
and 0
just 0
as 0
Annibale 0
Bugnini 0
was 0
cranking 0
open 0
the 0
floodgates 0
of 0
his 0
never-ending 0
stream 0
of 0
liturgical 0
alterations, 0
Mysterium 0
Fidei 0
is 0
now 0
an 0
important 0
marker 0
of 0
a 0
critical 0
turning 0
point 0
in 0
Catholic 0
history, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
of 0
modern 0
times. 0

Who 1

can 1
read 1
this 1
without 1
cringing 1
at 1
what 1
we 1
now 1
know 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
happen: 1

Therefore, 0
we 0
earnestly 0
hope 0
that 0
the 0
restored 0
sacred 0
liturgy 0
will 0
bring 0
forth 0
abundant 0
fruits 0
of 0
eucharistic 0
devotion, 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
Holy 0
Church, 0
under 0
this 0
saving 0
sign 0
of 0
piety, 0
may 0
make 0
daily 0
progress 0
toward 0
perfect 0
unity 0
and 0
may 0
invite 0
all 0
Christians 0
to 0
a 0
unity 0
of 0
faith 0
and 0
of 0
love, 0
drawing 0
them 0
gently, 0
thanks 0
to 0
the 0
action 0
of 0
divine 0
grace. 0

But 0
in 0
1983 0
at 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
my 0
personal 0
investigations 0
into 0
the 0
Catholic 0
religion, 0
I 0
knew 0
nothing 0
of 0
any 0
of 0
that. 0

The 0
encyclical, 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
I 0
ever 0
read, 0
was 0
also 0
a 0
marker 0
for 0
me 0
of 0
a 0
personal 0
turning 0
point. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
had 0
ever 0
seen 0
Catholic 0
eucharistic 0
doctrine 0
clearly 0
and 0
– 0
most 0
importantly 0
– 0
unapologetically 0
stated. 0

It 0
came 0
right 0
out 0
and 0
said 0
something 0
so 0
astounding, 0
something 0
so 0
completely 0
unlikely, 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
it 0
left 0
very 0
few 0
logical 0
possibilities. 0

Like 0
C.S. 0

Lewis’s 0
assessment 0
of 0
the 0
claims 0
by 0
Christ 0
of 0
His 0
own 0
divinity, 0
this 0
pope 0
was 0
either 0
mad, 0
bad 0
or 0
telling 0
the 0
plain 0
truth. 0

Something 0

that 0
may 0
be 0
much 0
more 0
noteworthy 0
now 0
in 0
our 0
current 0
circumstances 0
than 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
year 0
I 0
read 0
it, 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
pope’s 0
very 0
first 0
quote 0
was 0
not 0
of 0
scripture, 0
but 0
the 0
Council 0
of 0
Trent: 0

“At 0
the 0
Last 0
Supper, 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
He 0
was 0
handed 0
over, 0
Our 0
Lord 0
instituted 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
His 0
Body 0
and 0
Blood, 0
to 0
perpetuate 0
the 0
sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
cross 0
throughout 0
the 0
ages 0
until 0
He 0
should 0
come, 0
and 0
thus 0
entrust 0
to 0
the 0
Church, 0
His 0
beloved 0
spouse, 0
the 0
memorial 0
of 0
His 0
death 0
and 0
resurrection: 0
a 0
sacrament 0
of 0
devotion, 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
unity, 0
a 0
bond 0
of 0
charity, 0
a 0
paschal 0
banquet 0
in 0
which 0
Christ 0
is 0
received, 0
the 0
soul 0
is 0
filled 0
with 0
grace 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
given 0
to 0
us 0
the 0
pledge 0
of 0
future 0
glory.” 0

In 0

these 0
words 0
are 0
highlighted 0
both 0
the 0
sacrifice, 0
which 0
pertains 0
to 0
the 0
essence 0
of 0
the 0
Mass 0
which 0
is 0
celebrated 0
daily, 0
and 0
the 0
sacrament 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
faithful 0
participate 0
in 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
by 0
eating 0
the 0
Flesh 0
of 0
Christ 0
and 0
drinking 0
His 0
Blood, 0
receiving 0
both 0
grace, 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
eternal 0
life, 0
and 0
the 0
medicine 0
of 0
immortality. 0

I 0
remember 0
my 0
thoughts 0
upon 0
reading 0
this 0
shocking 0
statement… 0
“By 0
doing 0
what? 0

!” 0

My 0

acceptance 0
from 0
the 0
reading 0
of 0
this 0
document 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
orthodox 0
eucharistic 0
doctrine 0
was 0
based 0
in 0
part 0
on 0
Pope 1
Paul’s 1
gracious 1
and 1
beautiful 1
exposition, 1
and 1
in 1
part 1
on 1
the 1
sheer 1
radical, 1
mad 1
unlikeliness 1
of 1
it. 1

What 0
could 0
conceivably 0
be 0
the 0
reason 0
to 0
say 0
anything 0
as 0
wild 0
as 0
this 0
if 0
it 0
weren’t 0
true? 0

The 1

idea 1
of 1
transubstantiation 1
struck 1
me 1
as 1
I 1
read 1
that 1
document 1
as 1
possibly 1
the 1
strangest 1
and 1
most 1
earth 1
shattering 1
thing 1
I’d 1
ever 1
heard. 1

It 1
shocked 1
me 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
swamp 1
of 1
intellectual 1
worldliness; 1
presenting 1
the 1
idea 1
to 1
my 1
thirsty 1
mind 1
that 1
there 1
could 1
indeed 1
be 1
fantastic 1
realities 1
far 1
more 1
wonderful 1
than 1
the 1
banal 1
and 1
painfully 1
uninteresting 1
secularist 1
worldview 1
I 1
had 1
been 1
taught 1
to 1
accept. 1

It 1
was 1
as 1
though 1
someone 1
had 1
plausibly 1
told 1
me 1
that, 1
yes, 1
there 1
were 1
fairies 1
and 1
magical 1
kingdoms 1
in 1
real 1
life, 1
“just 1
around 1
the 1
corner”. 1

By 0

the 0
time 0
I 0
read 0
it, 0
I 0
had 0
been 0
through 0
a 0
long, 0
slow 0
transition 0
from 0
a 0
childhood 0
devoted 0
to 0
Our 0
Lady 0
and 0
confirmed 0
in 0
my 0
belief 0
in 0
wonders, 0
to 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
disappointed 0
practical 0
atheism 0
after 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
a 0
diocesan 0
Catholic 0
parochial 0
school. 0

I 0
had 0
been 0
taught, 0
by 0
both 0
word 0
and 0
implication, 0
that 0
everything 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
had 0
taught 0
before 0
Vatican 0
II 0
was 0
pernicious 1
nonsense. 1

Where 0
it 0
was 0
simply 0
wrong 0
it 0
was 0
ridiculous 0
and 0
where 0
it 0
was 0
wrong 0
and 0
political 0
it 1
was 1
outright 1
wicked. 1

What 0

led 0
me 0
to 0
read 0
that 0
particular 0
encyclical 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
clearly 0
identifiable 0
moment 0
of 0
actual 0
grace 0
in 0
my 0
young 0
life 0
to 0
that 0
point. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
it 0
occurred 0
to 0
me 0
to 0
investigate, 0
like 0
an 0
anthropologist, 0
what 0
the 0
Church 0
herself 0
said 0
about 0
her 0
teachings. 0

While 0
mulling 0
grimly 0
one 0
day 0
over 0
all 0
the 0
wickedness 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
I 0
was 0
pulled 0
up 0
short 0
by 0
a 0
single 0
thought: 0
“I 0
could 0
be 0
wrong.” 0
At 0
17 0
it 0
seemed 0
such 0
an 0
unlikely 0
thing 0
to 0
think 0
I 0
was 0
rather 0
shocked. 0

But 0
stopping 0
a 0
moment 0
to 0
consider, 0
I 0
realised 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
only 0
ever 0
heard 0
about 0
Catholic 0
things 0
from 0
people 0
who 0
clearly 0
hated 0
the 0
Church; 0
her 0
enemies, 0
in 0
short. 0

It 0
hardly 0
seemed 0
just 0
to 0
convict 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
these 0
obviously 0
biased 0
witnesses. 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
properly 0
and 0
thoroughly 0
condemn 0
the 0
Church, 0
with 0
convincing 0
due 0
diligence, 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
read 0
something 0
about 0
it 0
that 0
didn’t 0
come 0
from 0
her 0
enemies. 0

The 0

same 0
day, 0
I 0
presented 0
myself 0
at 0
the 0
reference 0
desk 0
of 0
the 0
public 0
library 0
and 0
asked, 0
“Do 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
books 0
about 0
Catholicism? 0

Something 0
official?” 0
The 0
librarian 0
took 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
reference 0
section 0
and 0
showed 0
me 0
the 0
shelves 0
of 0
encyclicals, 0
documents 0
and 0
histories. 0

Saints 0
and 0
popes 0
from 0
one 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
stacks 0
to 0
the 0
other. 0

Having 0
no 0
clear 0
idea 0
what 0
my 0
own 0
question 0
meant, 0
I 0
just 0
picked 0
one 0
at 0
random. 0

The 0

description 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
Eucharist 0
as 0
the 0
supreme 0
Centre 0
from 0
which 0
all 0
our 0
life 0
as 0
Catholics 0
flow, 0
and 0
from 0
which 0
all 0
other 0
doctrines 0
radiated, 0
was 0
something 0
that 0
was 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
come 0
into 0
my 0
head 0
for 0
another 0
eight 0
years 0
of 0
reading. 0

But 0
even 0
so, 0
Mysterium 0
Fidei 0
forced 0
me 0
to 0
face 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
reality 0
I’d 0
never 0
dreamed 0
of 0
before; 0
that 0
this, 0
the 0
little 0
unassuming 0
wafer, 0
was 0
the 0
most 0
important 0
thing 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

Reading 0

through 0
the 0
encyclical 0
again, 0
holding 0
it 0
up 0
next 0
to 0
the 0
current 0
situation 0
in 0
Rome, 0
makes 0
it 0
easier 0
to 0
clarify 0
certain 0
critical 0
issues. 0

Given 0
what 0
we 0
are 0
now 0
seeing, 0
consider 0
the 0
poignancy 0
of 0
the 0
following 0
passages: 0

When 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
restoration 0
of 0
the 0
sacred 0
liturgy, 0
the 0
Fathers 0
of 0
the 0
council, 0
by 0
reason 0
of 0
their 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
whole 0
Church, 0
considered 0
it 0
of 0
the 0
highest 0
importance 0
to 0
exhort 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
participate 0
actively 0
with 0
sound 0
faith 0
and 0
with 0
the 0
utmost 0
devotion 0
in 0
the 0
celebration 0
of 0
this 0
Most 0
Holy 0
Mystery, 0
to 0
offer 0
it 0
with 0
the 0
priest 0
to 0
God 0
as 0
a 0
sacrifice 0
for 0
their 0
own 0
salvation 0
and 0
for 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
whole 0
world, 0
and 0
to 0
find 0
in 0
it 0
spiritual 0
nourishment. 0

This 0
was, 0
remember, 0
1965, 0
four 0
years 0
before 0
the 0
New 0
Mass 0
was 0
issued 0
and 0
before 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani 0
warned 0
the 0
pope 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
precisely 0
this 1
sacramental 1
reality 1
that 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
be 1
catastrophically 1
obscured. 1

Who, 0

reading 0
this 0
passage, 0
does 0
not 0
feel 0
the 0
urge 0
to 0
shout 0
down 0
the 0
years, 0
to 0
do 0
something 0
to 0
stave 0
off 0
the 0
disaster 0
that 0
was 0
coming: 0

[W]e 0
are 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that, 0
among 0
those 0
who 0
deal 0
with 0
this 0
Most 0
Holy 0
Mystery 0
in 0
written 0
or 0
spoken 0
word, 0
there 0
are 0
some 0
who 0
with 0
reference 0
either 0
to 0
Masses 0
which 0
are 0
celebrated 0
in 0
private, 0
or 0
to 0
the 0
dogma 0
of 0
transubstantiation, 0
or 0
to 0
devotion 0
to 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
spread 0
abroad 0
opinions 0
which 0
disturb 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
fill 0
their 0
minds 0
with 0
no 0
little 0
confusion 0
about 0
matters 0
of 0
faith. 0

It 0
is 0
as 0
if 0
everyone 0
were 0
permitted 0
to 0
consign 0
to 0
oblivion 0
doctrine 0
already 0
defined 0
by 0
the 0
Church, 0
or 0
else 0
to 0
interpret 0
it 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
as 0
to 0
weaken 0
the 0
genuine 0
meaning 0
of 0
the 0
words 0
or 0
the 0
recognized 0
force 0
of 0
the 0
concepts 0
involved. 0

Keeping 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani’s 0
Intervention 0
directly 0
before 0
our 0
thoughts, 0
we 0
read 0
with 0
a 0
strange 0
kind 0
of 0
helpless 0
dread… 0

…it 1
is 1
not 1
allowable 1
to 1
emphasize 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
the 1
“communal” 1
Mass 1
to 1
the 1
disparagement 1
of 1
Masses 1
celebrated 1
in 1
private, 1
or 1
to 1
exaggerate 1
the 1
element 1
of 1
sacramental 1
sign 1
as 1
if 1
the 1
symbolism, 1
which 1
all 1
certainly 1
admit 1
in 1
the 1
Eucharist, 1
expresses 1
fully 1
and 1
exhausts 1
completely 1
the 1
mode 1
of 1
Christ’s 1
presence 1
in 1
this 1
sacrament. 1

Nor 1

is 1
it 1
allowable 1
to 1
discuss 1
the 1
mystery 1
of 1
transubstantiation 1
without 1
mentioning 1
what 1
the 1
Council 1
of 1
Trent 1
stated 1
about 1
the 1
marvelous 1
conversion 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
substance 1
of 1
the 1
bread 1
into 1
the 1
Body 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
substance 1
of 1
the 1
wine 1
into 1
the 1
Blood 1
of 1
Christ, 1
speaking 1
rather 1
only 1
of 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
“transignification” 1
and 1
“transfiguration,” 1
or 0
finally 0
to 0
propose 0
and 0
act 0
upon 0
the 0
opinion 0
according 0
to 0
which, 0
in 0
the 0
Consecrated 0
Hosts 0
which 0
remain 0
after 0
the 0
celebration 0
of 0
the 0
sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass, 0
Christ 0
Our 0
Lord 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
present. 0

[…] 0

And 0

therefore, 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
hope 0
aroused 0
by 0
the 0
council, 0
that 0
a 0
flourishing 0
of 0
eucharistic 0
piety 0
which 0
is 0
now 0
pervading 0
the 0
whole 0
Church, 0
be 0
not 0
frustrated 0
by 0
this 0
spread 0
of 0
false 0
opinions, 0
we 0
have 0
with 0
apostolic 0
authority 0
decided 0
to 0
address 0
you, 0
venerable 0
brothers, 0
and 0
to 0
express 0
our 0
mind 0
on 0
this 0
subject. 0

[1] 0

Those 0
of 0
us 0
writing 0
similar 0
jeremiads 0
now 0
have 0
been 0
working 0
to 0
clarify 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
from 0
Rome 0
on 0
the 0
moral 0
doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
isn’t 0
about 0
marriage. 0

It’s 0
about 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
and 0
to 0
a 0
lesser 0
extent 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

The 1
demonic 1
forces 1
we 1
know 1
are 1
the 1
driving 1
force 1
behind 1
this 1
supreme 1
moment 1
of 1
heresy 1
and 1
destruction 1
aren’t 1
really 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
undermining 1
of 1
marriage 1
as 1
their 1
primary 1
goal; 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
get 1
at 1
the 1
Eucharist. 1

We 1
know 1
it 1
is 1
demonically 1
inspired 1
because 1
their 1
hatred 1
is 1
for 1
Christ 1
Himself 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place 1
and 1
for 1
anyone 1
who 1
loves 1
and 1
wants 1
to 1
serve 1
Him 1
second. 1

They 1
are 1
men 1
who 1
refuse 1
to 1
bend 1
the 1
knee 1
before 1
the 1
God 1
whom 1
they 1
will 1
not 1
serve. 1

This 0

knowledge 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
Body 0
and 0
Blood 0
of 0
Christ 0
– 0
can 0
also 0
help 0
readers 0
spot 0
their 0
friends 0
in 0
the 0
crowd. 0

The 0
places 0
where 0
Eucharistic 0
adoration 0
is 0
still 0
offered 0
are 0
places 0
where 0
at 0
least 0
some 0
flicker 0
of 0
the 0
true 0
Faith 0
survives. 0

The 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
now 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
supreme 0
glory 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
and 0
the 0
need 0
to 0
defend 0
it 0
from 0
sacrilege, 0
are 0
lighthouses. 0

A 0
case 0
in 0
point 0
is 0
Bishop 0
Mark 0
Davies, 0
of 0
my 0
own 0
former 0
diocese 0
of 0
Shrewsbury 0
in 0
England. 0

In 0
March, 0
2016, 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
the 0
shouting 0
from 0
Rome, 0
Bishop 0
Davies 0
spoke 0
at 0
his 0
Chrism 0
Mass 0
said 0
that 0
only 0
through 0
the 0
“reality 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist” 0
could 0
new 0
vocations 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
be 0
found. 0

“In 0
treasuring 0
this 0
gift 0
of 0
priestly 0
celibacy 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
recognize 0
more 0
clearly 0
the 0
intimate 0
link 0
between 0
the 0
Ministerial 0
Priesthood 0
and 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist. 0

If 1
the 1
Mass 1
were 1
ever 1
reduced 1
in 1
our 1
minds 1
to 1
being 1
merely 1
a 1
commemorative 1
meal 1
and 1
the 1
priest 1
as 1
only 1
a 1
community 1
leader 1
or 1
functionary, 1
then 1
the 1
celibacy 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Priesthood 1
might 1
seem 1
extravagant.” 1

It’s 0
almost 0
as 0
if 0
someone 0
had 0
slipped 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
the 0
Ottaviani 0
Intervention 0
inside 0
his 0
morning 0
paper. 0

The 0

targeting 0
of 0
marriage, 0
through 0
the 0
instruments 0
of 0
creatures 0
like 0
the 0
myopic 0
and 0
theologically 0
tunnel-visioned 0
Cardinal 0
Kasper, 0
is 1
demonically 1
brilliant. 1

It’s 0
a 0
“stitch-up” 0
as 0
the 0
English 0
call 0
it; 0
a 0
fix. 0

You 0
make 0
it 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
“mercy” 0
(backed 0
up 0
by 0
the 0
iron 0
fist) 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
objective 0
mortal 0
sin 0
can 0
be 0
refused 0
Holy 0
Communion; 0
you 0
give 0
the 0
national 0
bishops 0
conferences 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
start 0
enforcing 0
this, 0
and 0
you 0
have 0
created 0
a 0
previously 0
unimaginable 0
situation 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

You 0
have 0
created 0
a 0
regime 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
refusal 0
to 0
desecrate 0
the 0
sacred 0
species 0
will 0
be 0
grounds 0
for 0
persecution 0
of 0
faithful 0
priests, 0
seminarians 0
and 0
laity. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
we 0
are 0
seeing 0
it 0
starting 0
already. 0

It’s 0

a 0
brilliant 0
strategy, 0
the 0
magic 0
bullet 0
that 0
will 0
revert 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
the 0
1976 0
model 0
on 0
every 0
front, 0
and 0
very 0
likely 0
keep 0
it 0
there 0
forever. 0

As 0
if 0
the 0
goal 0
was 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
in 0
time 0
and 0
erase 0
the 0
entire 0
John 0
Paul 0
II/Benedict 0
XVI 0
period 0
out 0
of 0
history. 0

It 0
will 0
halt 0
the 0
revival 0
of 0
eucharistic 0
piety 0
among 0
seminarians; 0
in 0
fact, 0
it 0
will 0
reverse 0
the 0
general 0
reforming 0
trend 0
of 0
“conservative” 0
seminaries 0
that 0
was 0
such 0
a 0
feature 0
under 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
has 0
for 0
30 0
years 0
been 0
the 0
hook 0
upon 0
which 0
all 0
hopes 0
of 0
restoration 0
have 0
hung. 0

It 0

is 0
easy 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
is 0
coming 0
next. 0

Once 0
certain 0
announcements 0
are 0
published 0
in 0
parish 0
bulletins, 0
laity 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
consider 0
whether 0
they 0
can, 0
in 0
conscience, 0
continue 0
to 0
assist 0
at 0
Masses 0
where 0
systematic 0
sacrilege 0
has 0
been 0
formally 0
adopted 0
as 0
the 0
rule. 0

The 0
few 0
bishops 0
with 0
sufficient 0
spine 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
pressure 0
of 0
both 0
Rome 0
and 0
their 0
own 0
national 0
conferences 0
– 0
newly 0
empowered 0
with 0
directives 0
to 0
make 0
doctrinal 0
declarations 0
– 0
will 1
be 1
ruling 1
embattled 1
islands 1
of 1
Catholicism 1
in 1
a 1
poisoned 1
sea 1
of 1
systematic 1
heresy 1
and 1
desecration. 1

A 1
dark, 1
impenetrable 1
and 1
“irreversible” 1
winter 1
of 1
persecution 1
of 1
the 1
faithful 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
shepherds 1
will 1
fall. 1

Not 0

being 0
a 0
theologian 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
if 0
this 0
encyclical 0
is, 0
as 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
seemingly 0
orthodox 0
documents 0
of 0
that 0
period 0
seem 0
to 0
be, 0
rife 0
with 0
the 0
usual 0
“time 0
bombs,” 0
ambiguities, 0
mushy 0
language 0
or 0
even 0
outright 0
errors. 0

I 0
haven’t 0
looked 0
it 0
up. 0

I’m 0
sure 0
there 0
are 0
plenty 0
of 0
people 0
out 0
there 0
qualified 0
to 0
examine 0
it 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
it’s 0
safe 0
for 0
Trad-Catholic 0
consumption. 0

And 0
I 0
have 0
no 0
doubt 0
at 0
all 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
better, 0
more 0
venerable, 0
even 0
more 0
sublime 0
and 0
poignant 0
works 0
on 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
in 0
the 0
canon 0
of 0
“official” 0
things. 0

From 0
saints 0
and 0
Doctors 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
whatnot, 0
many 0
of 0
which 0
the 0
pope 0
cited. 0

But 1
whatever 1
its 1
flaws, 1
Mysterium 1
Fidei 1
is 1
the 1
one 1
I 1
found, 1
and 1
I’m 1
convinced 1
it 1
wasn’t 1
an 1
accident. 1

O 0

God, 0
in 0
Your 0
infinite 0
mercy, 0
forgive 0
and 0
have 0
mercy 0
on 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
VI 0
Montini 0
for 0
whatever 0
neglect 0
or 0
damage 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
guilty. 0

In 0
this 0
one 0
case 0
at 0
least, 0
a 0
work 0
of 0
his 0
was 0
the 0
exact 0
right 0
thing 0
at 0
the 0
exact 0
right 0
time. 0

For 0
me 0
at 0
least 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
key 0
that 0
opened 0
the 0
Door 0
to 0
Narnia. 0

Pompeo's 0
remarks 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
came 0
hours 0
after 0
the 0
US 0
embassy 0
in 0
China 0
issued 0
a 0
health 0
warning 0
to 0
Americans 0
living 0
there 0
over 0
an 0
"unusual" 0
auditory 0
or 0
sensory 0
phenomena. 0

The 0
embassy 0
said 0
a 0
US 0
government 0
employee 0
in 0
the 0
southern 0
city 0
of 0
Guangzhou 0
reported 0
experiencing 0
a 0
"subtle 0
and 0
vague, 0
but 0
abnormal, 0
sensations 0
of 0
sound 0
and 0
pressure", 0
which 0
led 0
to 0
a 0
mild 0
brain 0
injury. 0

Pompeo 0
told 0
the 0
House 0
Foreign 0
Affairs 0
Committee 0
the 0
"sonic 0
attack" 0
in 0
China 0
was 0
similar 0
to 0
the 0
incidents 0
in 0
Cuba 0
last 0
year. 0

"The 0
medical 0
indications 0
are 0
very 0
similar 0
and 0
entirely 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
medical 0
indications 0
that 0
have 0
taken 0
place 0
to 0
Americans 0
working 0
in 0
Cuba," 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
US 0
was 0
moving 0
medical 0
teams 0
to 0
the 0
area 0
to 0
work 0
on 0
the 0
case, 0
he 0
said. 0

"We 0
are 0
working 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
what 0
took 0
place 0
both 0
in 0
Havana 0
and 0
now 0
in 0
China 0
as 0
well," 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

China's 0
foreign 0
ministry 0
did 0
not 0
comment 0
immediately. 0

Heather 0
Nauert, 0
the 0
state 0
department 0
spokeswoman, 0
said 0
the 0
US 0
embassy 0
learned 0
on 0
Friday 0
that 0
the 0
Guangzhou 0
employee 0
showed 0
concussion 0
symptoms 0
after 0
medical 0
testing. 0

That 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
clinical 0
finding 0
doctors 0
treating 0
the 0
Cuba 0
patients 0
at 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
Philadelphia 0
found. 0

The 0
Guangzhou 0
worker 0
started 0
experiencing 0
"a 0
variety 0
of 0
symptoms" 0
starting 0
in 0
late 0
2017 0
that 0
lasted 0
through 0
April 0
this 0
year, 0
Nauert 0
said. 0

The 0
worker 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
for 0
further 0
evaluation, 0
she 0
added. 0

In 0
Cuba 0
last 0
year, 0
24 0
diplomats 0
and 0
their 0
family 0
members 0
were 0
left 0
with 0
mysterious 0
injuries 0
resembling 0
brain 0
trauma, 0
which 0
were 0
suspected 0
of 0
being 0
caused 0
by 0
a 0
"sonic 0
attack". 0

Ten 0
Canadian 0
diplomats 0
and 0
their 0
relatives 0
also 0
suffered 0
similar 0
illnesses. 0

The 0
still-unexplained 0
incidents 0
sparked 0
a 0
rift 0
in 0
US-Cuban 0
relations, 0
while 0
investigators 0
have 0
chased 0
theories 0
including 0
a 0
sonic 0
attack, 0
an 0
electromagnetic 0
weapon, 0
or 0
a 0
flawed 0
spying 0
device. 0

Symptoms, 0
sounds 0
and 0
sensations 0
reportedly 0
varied 0
dramatically 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person, 0
according 0
to 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press. 0

Some 0
have 0
permanent 0
hearing 0
loss 0
or 0
concussions, 0
while 0
others 0
suffered 0
nausea, 0
headaches 0
and 0
ear-ringing. 0

Some 0
struggle 0
with 0
concentration 0
or 0
common 0
word 0
recall. 0

America's 0
Immigration 0
Voice. 0

The 0
Kurds 0
have 0
no 0
friends 0
but 0
the 0
mountains, 0
is 0
an 0
old 0
lament 0
. 0

Last 0
week, 0
it 0
must 0
have 0
been 0
very 0
much 0
on 0
Kurdish 0
minds. 0

As 0
their 0
U.S. 0
allies 0
watched, 0
the 0
Kurdish 0
peshmerga 0
fighters 0
were 0
run 0
out 0
of 0
Kirkuk 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
territory 0
they 0
had 0
captured 0
fighting 0
ISIS 0
alongside 0
the 0
Americans. 0

The 0
Iraqi 0
army 0
that 0
ran 0
them 0
out 0
was 0
trained 0
and 0
armed 0
by 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
had 0
warned 0
the 0
Kurds 0
against 0
holding 0
the 0
referendum 0
on 0
independence 0
on 0
Sept. 0
25, 0
which 0
carried 0
with 0
92 0
percent. 0

Iran 0
and 0
Turkey 0
had 0
warned 0
against 0
an 0
independent 0
Kurdistan 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
magnet 0
for 0
Kurdish 0
minorities 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
countries. 0

But 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
Kurds 0
went 0
ahead. 0

Now 0
they 0
have 0
lost 0
Kirkuk 0
and 0
its 0
oil, 0
and 0
their 1
dream 1
of 1
independence 1
is 1
all 1
but 1
dead. 1

More 0
troubling 0
for 0
America 0
is 0
the 0
new 0
reality 0
revealed 0
by 0
the 0
rout 0
of 0
the 0
peshmerga. 0

Iraq, 0
which 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
the 0
neocons 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
fashion 0
into 0
a 0
pro-Western 0
democracy 0
and 0
American 0
ally, 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
close 0
to 0
Iran 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

After 0
4,500 0
U.S. 0
dead, 0
scores 0
of 0
thousands 0
wounded 0
and 0
a 0
trillion 0
dollars 0
sunk, 0
our 0
15-year 0
war 0
in 0
Iraq 0
could 0
end 0
with 0
a 0
Shiite-dominated 0
Baghdad 0
aligned 0
with 0
Tehran. 0

With 0
that 0
grim 0
prospect 0
in 0
mind, 0
Secretary 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
said 0
Sunday 0
, 0
"Iranian 0
militias 0
that 0
are 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
fight 0
against 0
... 0
ISIS 0
is 0
coming 0
to 0
a 0
close 0
... 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
home. 0

Any 0
foreign 0
fighters 0
in 0
Iraq 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
home." 0

Tillerson 0
meant 0
Iran's 0
Quds 0
Force 0
in 0
Iraq 0
should 0
go 0
home, 0
and 0
the 0
Shiite 0
militia 0
in 0
Iraq 0
should 0
be 0
conscripted 0
into 0
the 0
army. 0

But 1
what 1
if 1
the 1
Baghdad 1
regime 1
of 1
Haider 1
al-Abadi 1
does 1
not 1
agree? 1

What 1
if 1
the 1
Quds 1
Force 1
does 1
not 1
go 1
home 1
to 1
Iran 1
and 1
the 1
Shiite 1
militias 1
that 1
helped 1
retake 1
Kirkuk 1
refuse 1
to 1
enlist 1
in 1
the 1
Iraqi 1
army? 1

Who 0
then 0
enforces 0
Tillerson's 0
demands? 0

Consider 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
Syria. 0

The 0
U.S.-backed 0
Syrian 0
Democratic 0
Forces, 0
largely 0
Kurdish, 0
just 0
annihilated 0
ISIS 0
in 0
Raqqa 0
and 0
drove 0
60 0
miles 0
to 0
seize 0
Syria's 0
largest 0
oil 0
field, 0
al-Omar, 0
from 0
ISIS. 0

The 0
race 0
is 0
now 0
on 0
between 0
the 0
SDF 0
and 0
Bashar 0
Assad's 0
army 0
to 0
secure 0
the 0
border 0
with 0
Iraq. 0

Bottom 0
line: 0
The 0
U.S. 0
goal 0
of 0
crushing 0
the 0
ISIS 0
caliphate 0
is 0
almost 0
attained. 0

But 0
if 0
our 0
victory 0
in 0
the 0
war 0
against 0
ISIS 0
leaves 0
Iran 0
in 0
the 0
catbird 0
seat 0
in 0
Baghdad 0
and 0
Damascus, 0
and 0
its 0
corridor 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Baghdad, 0
Damascus 0
and 0
Beirut 0
secure, 1
is 1
that 1
really 1
a 1
victory? 1

Do 1
we 1
accept 1
that 1
outcome, 1
pack 1
up 1
and 1
go 1
home? 1

Or 1
do 1
we 1
leave 1
our 1
forces 1
in 1
Syria 1
and 1
Iraq 1
and 1
defy 1
any 1
demand 1
from 1
Assad 1
to 1
vacate 1
his 1
country? 1

Sunday's 0
editorial 0
in 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
"The 0
Next 0
Mideast 0
Wars," 0
raises 0
the 0
crucial 0
questions 0
now 0
before 0
us. 0

Would 0
President 0
Trump 0
be 0
willing 0
to 0
fight 0
a 0
new 0
war 0
to 0
keep 0
Iran 0
from 0
consolidating 0
its 0
position 0
in 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria? 0

Would 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
support 1
such 1
a 1
war 1
with 1
U.S. 1
troops? 1

Would 0
Congress, 0
apparently 1
clueless 1
to 1
the 1
presence 1
of 1
800 1
U.S. 1
troops 1
in 1
Niger, 1
authorize 0
a 0
new 0
U.S. 0
war 0
in 0
Syria 0
or 0
Iraq? 0

If 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
generals 0
felt 0
our 0
vital 0
interests 0
could 0
not 0
allow 0
Syria 0
and 0
Iraq 0
to 0
drift 0
into 0
the 0
orbit 0
of 0
Iran, 0
where 0
would 0
we 0
find 0
allies 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
fight? 0

If 1
we 1
rely 1
on 1
the 1
Kurds 1
in 1
Syria, 1
we 1
lose 1
NATO 1
ally 1
Turkey, 1
which 1
regards 1
Syria's 1
Kurds 1
as 1
collaborators 1
of 1
the 1
PKK 1
in 1
Turkey, 1
which 1
even 1
the 1
U.S. 1
designates 1
a 1
terrorist 1
organization. 1

The 0
decision 0
as 0
to 0
whether 0
this 0
country 0
should 0
engage 0
in 0
new 0
post-ISIS 0
wars 0
in 0
the 0
Mideast, 0
however, 0
may 0
be 0
taken 0
out 0
of 0
our 0
hands. 0

Saturday, 0
Israel 0
launched 0
new 0
air 0
strikes 0
against 0
gun 0
positions 0
in 0
Syria 0
in 0
retaliation 0
for 0
shells 0
fired 0
into 0
the 0
Golan 0
Heights. 0

Damascus 0
claims 0
that 0
Israel's 0
"terrorist" 1
allies 0
inside 0
Syria 0
fired 0
the 0
shells, 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
IDF 0
an 0
excuse 0
to 0
attack. 0

Why 0
would 0
Israel 0
wish 0
to 0
provoke 0
a 0
war 0
with 0
Syria? 0

Because 0
the 0
Israelis 0
see 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
the 0
six-year 0
Syrian 0
civil 0
war 0
as 0
a 0
strategic 0
disaster. 0

Hezbollah, 0
stronger 0
than 0
ever, 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
Assad's 0
victorious 0
coalition. 0

Iran 0
may 0
have 0
secured 0
its 0
land 0
corridor 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0
Beirut. 0

Its 0
presence 0
in 0
Syria 0
could 0
now 0
be 0
permanent. 0

And 1
only 1
one 1
force 1
in 1
the 1
region 1
has 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
reverse 1
the 1
present 1
outcome 1
of 1
Syria's 1
civil 1
war--the 1
United 1
States. 1

Bibi 0
Netanyahu 0
knows 0
that 0
if 0
war 0
with 0
Syria 0
breaks 0
out, 0
a 0
clamor 0
will 0
arise 0
in 0
Congress 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
U.S. 0
rush 0
to 0
Israel's 0
aid. 0

"A 0
failure 1
by 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
to 1
defend 1
its 1
allies 1
or 1
promote 1
new 1
political 1
arrangements 1
for 1
(Syria 1
and 1
Iraq) 1
will 1
lead 1
only 1
to 1
more 1
war, 1
the 1
rise 1
of 1
new 1
terrorist 1
threats, 1
and, 1
ultimately, 1
the 1
necessity 1
of 1
more 1
U.S. 1

intervention." 1

Closing 0
its 0
Sunday 0

the 0

instructed 0
the 0

MAJOR 0
NEW 0
STUDY: 0
Homeschooling 0
Spikes 0
Due 0
to 0
School 1
Violence, 1
Far-Left 0
Bias 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
33-year-long 0
study 0
conducted 0
by 0
the 0
National 0
Home 0
Education 0
Research 0
Institute 0
in 0
Oregon, 0
the 0
top 0
three 0
reasons 0
that 0
parents 0
choose 0
homeschooling 0
are 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
provide 0
religious 0
instruction 0
or 0
different 0
values 0
than 0
those 0
offered 0
in 0
public 0
schools; 0
dissatisfaction 0
with 0
the 0
academic 0
curriculum, 0
and 0
worries 0
about 0
the 0
school 0
environment. 0

As 0
reported 0
by 0
The 0
Washington 0
Times, 0
the 0
recent 0
school 1
shooting 1
at 0
Parkland, 0
Fla., 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
straw 0
for 0
scores 0
of 0
parents. 0

The 0
paper 0
noted 0
that 0
“the 0
phones 0
started 0
ringing 0
at 0
the 0
Texas 0
Home 0
School 0
Coalition, 0
and 0
they 0
haven’t 0
stopped 0
yet.” 0

The 0
Times 0
added:The 0
Lubbock-based 0
organization 0
has 0
been 0
swamped 1
with 0
inquiries 0
for 0
months 0
from 0
parents 0
seeking 0
safer 0
options 0
for 0
their 0
kids 0
in 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
this 0
year’s 0
deadly 1
school 1
massacres, 1
first 0
in 0
Parkland 0
and 0
then 0
in 0
Santa 0
Fe, 0
Texas. 0

“When 0
the 0
Parkland 0
shooting 1
happened, 0
our 0
phone 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
exploded,” 1
said 0
coalition 0
president 0
Tim 0
Lambert. 0

“In 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
months, 0
our 0
numbers 0
have 0
doubled. 0

We’re 0
dealing 0
with 0
probably 0
between 0
1,200 0
and 0
1,400 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
per 0
month, 0
and 0
prior 0
to 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
600 0
to 0
700.” 0

While 0
the 0
debate 0
rages 0
anew 0
over 0
familiar 0
topics 0
following 0
such 0
tragedies 0
— 0
tougher, 0
more 0
restrictive 0
gun 0
control 0
laws 0
and 0
bolstering 0
security 0
at 0
public 0
schools 0
— 0
the 0
revolution 1
in 0
homeschooling 0
has 0
been 0
taking 0
place 0
quietly, 0
behind 0
the 0
scenes 0
and 0
off 0
the 0
radar 0
screens 0
of 0
most 0
political 0
organizations. 0

But 0
again, 0
it’s 0
not 0
just 0
the 0
shootings, 1
which 0
admittedly 0
have 0
increased 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
couple 0
of 0
years. 0

Christopher 0
Chin, 0
head 0
of 0
Homeschool 0
Louisiana, 0
told 0
The 0
Times 0
that 0
parents 0
are 0
fed 0
up 0
with 0
“the 0
violence, 1
the 0
bullying, 1
the 0
unsafe 0
environments.” 0

The 0
Left 0
is 0
driving 0
more 0
kids 0
OUT 0
of 0
public 0
schools 0

There 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
Left-wing 1
social 1
engineering. 1

The 0
craziness 1
over 0
transgender 0
students 0
and 0
bathrooms/locker 0
rooms, 0
allowing 0
students 0
to 0
“take 0
a 0
knee” 0
during 0
the 0
playing 0
of 0
the 0
National 0
Anthem, 0
the 0
Left-wing 0
curriculum, 0
and 0
refusing 0
to 0
allow 0
students 0
to 0
wear 0
shirts 0
that 0
praise 0
POTUS 0
Trump 0
or 0
feature 0

REMNANT 0
COMMENT: 0
We 0
here 0
at 0
The 0
Remnant 0
are 0
always 0
eager 0
to 0
promote 0
the 0
home-schooling 0
movement, 0
and 0
this 0
report 0
helps 0
illustrate 0
why. 0

At 0
the 0
moment 0
and 0
personally 0
speaking, 0
my 0
own 0
family’s 0
home-school 0
is 0
going 0
great 0
guns. 0

We 0

MSM 0
Using 0
Kavanaugh 0
Sex 0
Scandal 0
to 0
Distract 0
You 0
From 0
Real 0
Reason 0
He 0
Shouldn’t 0
Be 0
Confirmed 0

In 0
July, 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
nominated 0
D.C. 0

Circuit 0
Court 0
of 0
Appeals 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

Since 0
then, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
numerous 0
allegations 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
levied 0
toward 0
the 0
Justice 0
to 0
be. 0

Whether 0
or 0
not 0
he 0
is 0
guilty 0
of 0
these 0
allegations 0
is 0
left 0
to 0
be 0
determined. 0

However, 0
it 0
does 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
great 0
distraction 0
from 0
his 0
actual 0
constitution-hating 1
and 1
tyrannical 1
tendencies. 1

While 0
Kavanaugh 0
may 0
be 0
an 0
ostensible 0
supporter 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment, 0
his 1
record 1
indicates 1
that 1
he 1
all 1
but 1
cannot 1
stand 1
the 1
Fourth 1
and 1
he’s 1
not 1
that 1
big 1
a 1
fan 1
of 1
the 1
First 1
either. 1

While 0
the 0
allegations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
should 0
certainly 0
be 0
investigated 0
— 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
spun 0
by 0
the 0
left 0
and 0
the 0
right 0
— 0
he 1
shouldn’t 1
even 1
be 1
in 1
this 1
position 1
based 1
solely 1
on 1
his 1
previous 1
record. 1

But 0
no 0
one 0
is 0
talking 0
about 0
this. 0

Instead, 0
the 0
left 0
and 0
right 0
are 0
involved 0
in 0
a 1
mudslinging 1

of 1

he 0

it 1

just 1
fine 1
and 1

for 0
police 0
and 0
government 0
to 0
track 0
you, 0

on 0
you, 0
and 0
dig 0
through 0
your 0
personal 0
life 0
— 0
without 0
a 0
warrant. 0

On 0
multiple 0
occasions, 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
lone 0
voice 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
supporting 0
the 0
state’s 0
rights 0
to 0
warrantlessly 0
spy 0
on 0
its 0
citizens. 0

As 0
Reason 0
points 0
out, 0
in 0
2010 0
he 0
dissented 0
from 0
the 0
D.C. 0
Circuit’s 0
decision 0
not 0
to 0
rehear 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
three-judge 0
panel 0
had 0
ruled 0
that 0
police 0
violated 0
a 0
suspected 0
drug 0
dealer’s 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
when 0
they 0
tracked 0
his 0
movements 0
for 0
a 0
month 0
by 0
attaching 0
a 0
GPS 0
device 0
to 0
his 0
car 0
without 0
a 0
warrant. 0

Kavanaugh 0
claimed 0
that 0
putting 0
a 0
GPS 0
tracking 0
device 0
on 0
a 0
person’s 0
car 0
without 0
first 0
obtaining 0
a 0
warrant 0
was 0
just 0
fine 0
because 0
it 0
didn’t 0
constitute 0
a 0
“search” 0
as 0
defined 0
by 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment. 0

To 0
Kavanaugh, 0
bypassing 0
the 0
courts 0
and 0
tracking 0
an 0
individual 0
without 0
their 0
consent 0
is 0
“constitutional.” 0
In 0
this 0
line 0
of 0
thinking, 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
is 0
not 0
violated 0
even 0
if 0
police 0
trespass 0
on 0
someone’s 0
physical 0
property, 0
or 0
track 0
someone’s 0
cell 0
phone. 0

Luckily, 0
he 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
judge 0
on 0
the 0
panel 0
to 0
think 0
this. 0

In 0
June, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
ruled 0
specifically 0
on 0
this 0
case 0
noting 0
that 0
collecting 0
such 0
information 0
actually 0
does 0
constitute 0
a 0
search 0
and 0
therefore 0
requires 0
a 0
warrant. 0

But 0
it 0
gets 0
worse. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Kavanaugh 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
strongly 0
defending 0
the 0
NSA’s 0
phone 0
metadata 0
collection 0
program, 0
arguing 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
“entirely 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment.” 0
To 0
Kavanaugh, 0
sweeping 0
programs 0
that 0
collect 0
information 0
from 0
innocent 0
citizens’ 0
phones 0
are 0
not 0
in 0
conflict 0
with 0
having 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
be 0
free 0
from 0
unlawful 0
search 0
and 0
seizure. 0

Seriously. 1

According 0
to 0
Kavanaugh, 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
allows 0
for 0
searches 0
“without 0
individualized 0
suspicion” 0
when 0
the 0
government 0
demonstrates 0
a 0
“special 0
need” 0
that 0
“outweighs 0
the 0
intrusion 0
on 0
individual 0
liberty.” 0

Exactly 0
what 0
this 0
“special 0
need” 0
is 0
that 0
can 0
constitute 0
a 0
Gestapo 1
like 1
police 1
state 1
surveilling 1
its 0
own 0
citizens 0
is 0
a 0
moving 0
target 0
that 0
has 0
already 0
been 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
abused 0
over 0
and 0
over 0
again. 0

“The 0
sacrifice 0
of 0
our 0
personal 0
liberty 0
for 0
security 0
is 0
and 0
will 0
forever 0
be 0
a 0
false 0
choice,” 0
Senator 0
Rand 0
Paul 0
said 0
of 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
views 0
on 0
the 0
disposable 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
constitution. 0

Kavanaugh 0
“has 0
no 0
qualms 0
about 0
applying 0
decades-old 0
case 0
law 0
to 0
the 0
digital 0
age, 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
endorsed 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
a 0
“counterterrorism 0
exception” 0
to 0
the 0
Fourth 0
Amendment’s 0
warrant 0
requirement,” 0
said 0
Liza 0
Goitein, 0
co-director 0
of 0
the 0
Brennan 0
Center 0
for 0
Justice’s 0
Liberty 0
and 0

Security 0
Program. 0

While 0
the 0
left 0
is 0
calling 0
for 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 1
be 1
executed 1
over 1
the 1
sex 1
abuse 1
allegations 1
and 0
the 0
right 0
is 0
attacking 0
the 0
alleged 0
victims, 0
others 0
in 0
Congress 0
who 0
see 0
through 0
the 0
facade 0
and 0
media 0
distraction 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
draw 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
champion 1
of 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
surveillance 1
state 1
and 1
an 1
enemy 1
to 1
privacy. 1

Representative 0
Justin 0
Amash 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Kavanaugh 0
will 0
be 0
appointed. 0

However, 0
this 0
hasn’t 0
prevented 0
him 0
from 0
becoming 0
the 0
only 0
Republican 0
to 0
speak 0
out 0
against 0
the 0
real 0
reasons 0
he 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
appointed 0
to 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

“Privacy 1
advocates 1
must 1
fight,” 1
Amash 0
tweeted. 0

“There 0
are 0
many 0
potential 0
nominees 0
with 0
a 0
conservative 0
record 0
on 0
abortion, 0
guns, 0
and 0
regulations. 0

The 1
only 1
question 1
is 1
will 1
the 1
Senate 1
confirm 1
one 1
who 1
is 1
really 1
bad 1
on 1
the 1
#4thAmendment, 1
when 0
so 0
much 0
is 0
at 0
stake 0
in 0
upcoming 0
digital 0
privacy 0
battles.” 0

Indeed, 0
as 0
technology 0
increases, 0
so 0
does 0
the 0
desire 0
of 0
the 0
state 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
to 0
spy 0
on 0
us. 0

The 0
cases 0
headed 0
to 0
the 0
supreme 0
court 0
in 0
the 0
future 0
over 0
what 0
constitutes 0
an 0
unconstitutional 0
search 0
will 0
undoubtedly 0
be 0
vast 0
in 0
number 0
and 0
detrimental 0
in 0
deciding 0
how 0
much 0
freedom 0
and 0
privacy 0
Americans 0
get 0
to 0
keep. 0

As 0
for 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
gets 0
appointed, 0
Amash 0
has 0
some 0
harsh 0
words 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
blindly 1
supporting 1
him 1
based 0
on 0
party 0
lines: 0

“When 1

on 1
the 1
Supreme 1
Court, 1
undermining 1
our 1

it 1

are 1
blaming 1
the 1

of 1
dealing 1

Even 0
if 0

Muslim 0

is 0
a 0

In 0
retweeting 0
Jayda 0
Fransen’s 0
posts, 0
it 0
is 0
absolutely 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
is 0
supporting 0
and 0
condoning 0
fascism 0
and 0
far-right 0
activity. 0

This 0
activity 0
has 0
frequently 0
taken 0
the 0
form 0
of 0
violence 0
on 0

Ms 0

some 0

Many 0

the 0
people 0
you 0
have 0
rightly 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
UK 0
were 0
guilty 0
of 0
less 0
than 0
this.” 0

“Fascism.” 0
By 0
that 0
Bryant 0
means 0
“defending 1
British 1
values.” 1

While 0
admitting 0
numerous 0
jihad 0
preachers, 0
Britain 0
is 0
keeping 0
out 0
the 1
voices 1
of 1
sanity 1
that 0
would 0
call 1
that 1
nation 1
back 1
to 1
a 1
path 1
that 1
would 1
secure 1
freedom 1
for 1
her 1
children 1
and 1
her 1
children’s 1
children 1
instead 1
of 1
a 1
path 1
to 1

suicide. 1

And 0
now 0
a 0
call 0
to 0
ban 0
the 0

In 0
a 0
statement 0
by 0
Fox 0

President 0
Jay 0
Wallace, 0
he 0
wrote: 0

“Fox 0

in 0
its 0
legal 0
effort 0
to 0
regain 0
its 0
White 0

We 0
intend 0
to 0

Secret 0

While 0
we 0

tone 0
by 0
both 0

and 0

So, 0

On 1
the 1

of 1
what, 1
Mr. 0

The 0

you 0
know 0

Jim 0

CNN 0
continue 0
to 0
lie, 1
just 0
like 0
they 0
have 0
for 0
decades, 0
and 0
here's 0
the 0
proof. 0

Look 0
how 0
they 0
doctored 0
the 0
video 0
to 0
not 0
show 0
what 0
clearly 0
took 0
place 0
and 0
then 0
lied 1
about 0
it, 0
and 0
I 0
suppose 0
Fox 0
falls 0
right 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
that 0
behavior. 0

So, 0
Fox 0
joins 0
with 0
the 1
least 1
trusted 1
name 1
in 1
news, 1
the 1
Clown 1
News 1
Network, 1
to 0
go 0
after 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
something 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
White 0
House's 0
prerogative 0
and 0
claim 0
it's 0
about 0
free 0
press. 0

It's 0
not. 0

Fox 0
reported: 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
Correspondents’ 0
Association 0
– 0
of 0
which 0
Fox 0
News 0
is 0
a 0
member 0
– 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
CNN’s 0
decision 0
to 0
take 0
legal 0
action. 0

“We 0
continue 0
to 0
urge 0
the 0
administration 0
to 0
reverse 0
course 0
and 0
fully 0
reinstate 0
CNN’s 0
correspondent,” 0
WHCA 0
President 0
Olivier 0
Knox 0
said. 0

“The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
business 0
of 0
arbitrarily 0
picking 0
the 0
men 0
and 0
women 0
who 0
cover 0
him.” 0
However, 0
several 0
prominent 0
media 0
members 0
– 0
such 0
as 0
Pulitzer 1
Prize-winning 1
Watergate 1
journalist 1
Bob 1
Woodward 1
– 1
have 1
criticized 1
CNN 1
over 1
the 1
lawsuit. 1

As 0
they 0
should. 0

It's 0
frivolous, 1
but 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
immature 1
children 1
over 0
at 0
CNN, 0
it's 0
not 0
surprising, 0
and 0
frankly, 0
it's 0
no 0
surprise 0
coming 0
from 0
Fox 0
either. 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
called 0
the 0
CNN 0
lawsuit 0
"grandstanding." 0

I 0
wonder 0
what 0
she 0
will 0
call 0
the 0
amicus 0
brief 0
from 0
Fox. 0

"This 0
is 0
just 0
more 0
grandstanding 0
from 0
CNN, 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
vigorously 0
defend 0
against 0
this 0
lawsuit,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“CNN, 0
who 0
has 0
nearly 0
50 0
additional 0
hard 0
pass 0
holders, 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
is 0
no 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
special 0
than 0
any 0
other 0
media 0
outlet 0
or 0
reporter 0
with 0
respect 0
to 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment. 0

After 0
Mr. 0
Acosta 0
asked 0
the 0
President 0
two 0
questions 0
— 0
each 0
of 0
which 0
the 0
President 0
answered 0
— 0
he 0
physically 0
refused 0
to 0
surrender 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
microphone 0
to 0
an 0
intern, 0
so 0
that 0
other 0
reporters 0
might 0
ask 0
their 0
questions. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
this 0
reporter 0
has 0
inappropriately 0
refused 0
to 0
yield 0
to 0
other 0
reporters.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
CNN 0
was 0
thrilled 0
as 0
Fox 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
helped 0
them 0
grow 0
a 0
little 0
in 0
ratings 0
by 0
issuing 0
support. 0

The 0
propaganda 0
outlet 0
tweeted 0
out 0
Fox's 0
statement. 0

Fox 0

will 0
file 0

Here's 0
the 0
thing, 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
press 0
pass 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House, 0
where 0
is 0
mine? 0

and 0
yours? 0

How 0
about 0
Infowars? 0

See? 0

It 0
isn't 0
a 0
right 0
and 0
Fox 0
News 0
just 0
pulled 0
the 0
mask 0
off, 0
people. 0

Do 0
you 0
see 0
who 0
they 0
really 0
are 0
now? 0

If 0
not, 0
I 0
can't 0
help 0
you. 0

The 0
Sun 0
is 0
getting 0
cooler 0
and 0
dimmer, 0
but 1
scientists 1
aren’t 1
worried 1

In 0
what 0
is 0
being 0
considered 0
a 0
particularly 0
rare 0
event, 0
scientists 0
are 0
projecting 0
that 0
the 0
Sun 0
will 0
be 0
an 0
unusually 0
cool 0
customer 0
by 0
the 0
year 0
2050. 0

By 0
combining 0
data 0
and 0
observations 0
from 0
decades 0
of 0
Sun 0
research, 0
experts 0
are 0
predicting 0
a 0
“Grand 0
Solar 0
Minimum” 0
will 0
occur 0
a 0
few 0
decades 0
from 0
now, 0
making 0
our 0
parent 0
star 0
dimmer 0
and 0
cooler 0
than 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
for 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time. 0

The 0
Sun 0
might 0
look 0
the 0
same 0
to 0
you 0
today 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
since 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
you 0
laid 0
eyes 0
on 0
it, 0
but 0
our 0
star 0
actually 0
displays 0
plenty 0
of 0
changes. 0

The 0
Sun 0
goes 0
through 0
regular 0
cycles 0
of 0
solar 0
minimums 0
and 0
solar 0
maximums, 0
which 0
are 0
periods 0
where 0
the 0
Sun 0
is 0
either 0
quite 0
calm 0
(the 0
minimum) 0
or 0
incredibly 0
active 0
(the 0
maximum). 0

These 0
patterns 0
repeat 0
every 0
11 0
years 0
or 0
so, 0
but 0
new 0
research 0
suggests 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 0
pattern 0
behind 0
the 0
pattern, 0
and 0
that 0
a 0
particularly 0
cool 0
solar 0
minimum 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
way. 0

The 0
study, 0
which 0
was 0
published 0
in 0
Astrophysical 0
Journal 0
Letters, 0
was 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
a 0
team 0
led 0
by 0
physicist 0
Dan 0
Lubin 0
of 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
California, 0
San 0
Diego. 0

After 0
combing 0
the 0
data, 0
Lubin’s 0
team 0
has 0
forecasted 0
a 0
grand 0
minimum 0
that 0
will 0
be 0
around 0
seven 0
percent 0
cooler 0
than 0
the 0
typical 0
solar 0
minimum, 0
making 0
it 0
a 0
particularly 0
calm 0
moment 0
for 0
our 0
star. 0

During 0
a 0
solar 0
minimum, 0
the 0
Sun 0
produces 0
far 0
fewer 0
solar 0
flares 0
and 0
sunspots, 0
and 0
as 0
a 0
result, 0
much 0
less 0
ultraviolet 0
radiation 0
is 0
shot 0
out 0
into 0
space 0
and 0
towards 0
Earth. 0

This 0
can 0
have 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
effects 0
on 0
our 0
planet, 0
including 0
changes 0
in 0
the 0
thickness 0
of 0
the 0
stratospheric 0
ozone 0
layer 0
and 0
temperatures 0
far 0
above 0
ground. 0

Those 0
changes 0
can 0
affect 0
weather, 0
though 0
forecasting 0
specific 0
differences 0
has 0
proven 0
difficult. 0

The 0
grand 0
minimum 0
will 0
be 0
an 0
exaggerated 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
typical 0
solar 0
minimum, 0
and 0
could 0
produce 0
some 0
very 0
noticeable 0
effects. 0

The 0
most 0
recent 0
grand 0
minimum 0
is 0
thought 0
to 0
have 0
occurred 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
mid 0
1600s. 0

The 0
event, 0
called 0
the 0
Maunder 0
Minimum, 0
is 0
credited 0
with 0
plunging 0
temperatures 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
where 0
the 0
Thames 0
River 0
and 0
Baltic 0
Sea 0
froze 0
over. 0

However, 0
other 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
planet 0
heated 0
up, 0
including 0
Alaska 0
and 0
Greenland, 0
to 0
far 0
above 0
their 0
normal 0
highs. 0

This 0
temporary 0
shakeup 0
of 0
temperatures 0
could 0
happen 0
again, 0
though 0
the 0
researchers 1
say 1
it 1
will 1
have 1
very 1
little 1
effect 1
on 1
the 1
overall 1
global 1
warming 1
trend 1
that 1
mankind 1
has 1
created 1
for 1
itself. 1

to 0
join 0
a 0
caravan 0
of 0
several 0
thousand 0
trekking 0
through 0

“All 0

Not 0
only 0
did 0
Trump 0
threaten 0
to 0
send 0
the 0

to 0
the 0

but 0
he 0
also 0

to 0
Guatemala, 0
Honduras, 0
and 0
El 0
Salvador 0
if 0
they 0
didn't 0
block 0
the 0
caravan. 0

The 0
obvious 0
question 0
I 0
have 0
is: 0
Why 0
are 0
you 0
not 0
stopping 0
those 0
payments 0
now, 0
Mr. 0
President? 0

They 0
are 0
unconstitutional 1
and 0
neither 0
Congress 0
nor 0
you 0
have 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
give 0
American's 1
money 0
to 0
these 0
countries. 0

Trump 0
also 0
seemed 0
ready 0
to 0
back 0
out 0
on 0
his 0
new 0
trade 0
deal, 0
which 0
is 0
hardly 0
a 0
deal 0
for 0
the 0
US, 0
with 0
Mexico 0
if 0
they 0
failed 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
caravan. 0

He 0
then 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
many 0
who 0
cross 0
the 0
border 0
are 0
criminals 0
and 0
are 0
coming 1
to 1
engage 1
in 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

In 0
fact, 0
every 0
single 0
migrant 0
who 0
crosses 0
over 0
into 0
our 0
country 0
will 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
commit 0
at 0
least 0
28 0
crimes 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
present 0
themselves 0
as 0
legal. 0

“The 0

The 0

is 0
a 0

should 0
be 0
done 0
away 0
with 0
without 0
this 0

of 0

if 0
these 0

stop 0
the 0

or 0
if 0
it 0
continues 0
to 0
the 0

they 0

it 0
here 0
and 0

does 0
nothing 0

them 0

The 0
JFK 0
Cover-Up 0
Continues 0

While 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
was 0
announcing 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
two 0
weeks 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
release 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
long-secret 0
records 0
on 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination, 0
I 0
took 0
a 0
different 0
position. 0

On 0
Monday 0
of 0
this 0
week, 0
I 0
predicted 0
that 0
Trump 0
would 0
make 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0

that 0
would 0
enable 0
the 0

assassination. 0

(See 0

the 0

of 0
the 0
deadline 0
established 0
by 0

for 0

the 0

Trump 0
granted 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
continued 0
secrecy, 0
on 0
grounds 0
of 0

he 0
was 0
obviously 0
pushing 0
to 0

what 0
he 0
wanted 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
very 0
last 0

On 0
Thursday, 0
the 0
deadline 0
established 0
by 0

the 0

the 0

undoubtedly 0

The 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
put 0
in 0
its 0
request 0
to 0
Trump 0
for 0
continued 0
secrecy 0
of 0
its 0

long 0
before 0

But 0
“Art 1
of 1

Trump 1
obviously 1
sat 1
on 1
the 1
request, 1
undoubtedly 1
hoping 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
get 1
what 1
he 1
wanted 1
in 1
return 1
if 1
he 1
just 1
continued 1
holding 1
out 1
and 1
conveying 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
ready 1
to 1
release 1
the 1
records. 1

Don’t 0
forget: 0
According 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
own 0
tweets, 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
ostensibly 0
decided 0
to 0
deny 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
secrecy 0
before 0
the 0
Thursday 0
deadline: 0

Trump 0
tweet 0
sent 0
on 0
Saturday, 0
October 0
21: 0
“Subject 0
to 0
the 0
receipt 0
of 0
further 0

I 0
will 0
be 0
allowing, 0
as 0

So 1
interesting! 1

Now, 0
it’s 0
theoretically 0
possible 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
presented 0
Trump 0
with 1
some 1
earthshattering 1
new 1
information 1
on 0
the 0
Thursday 0
deadline 0
that 0
showed 0
that 0
the 1
United 1
States 1
would 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
if 1
Americans 1
were 1
finally 1
permitted 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
long-secret 1
JFK 0
records. 0

But 1
how 1
likely 1
is 1
that? 1

Not 0
likely 0
at 0
all! 0

Instead, 0
it 1
is 1
a 1
virtual 1
certainly 1
that 1
when 1
Art 1
of 1
the 1
Deal 1
Trump 1
sent 1
out 1
those 1
two 1
tweets, 1
he 1
was 1
sending 1
a 1
message 1
to 1
the 1
CIA 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
negotiations: 1
Give 1
me 1
what 1
I 1
want 1
or 1
I 1
will 1
release 1
the 1
records. 1

In 0
the 0
negotiations, 0
both 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
knew 0
that 0
Trump 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
catbird 0

In 0
the 0
end, 0
the 0
CIA 0
blinked, 0
just 0
as 0
Trump 0
knew 0
it 0
would. 0

Contrary 0
to 0
what 0
the 0
mainstream 0
press 0
is 0
asserting, 0
the 1
records 1
undoubtedly 1
contain 1
more 1
incriminating 1
circumstantial 1
evidence 1
that 1
fills 1
in 1
the 1
mosaic 1
of 1
a 1
U.S. 1
national-security 1
regime-change 1
operation 1
on 1
November 1
22, 1
1963. 1

That’s 0
what 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
forever 0
wedded 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
story 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
ridiculous 1
and 1
illogical 1
it 0
is, 0
simply 0
cannot 0
bring 0
themselves 0
to 0
confront. 0

Trump 0
knew 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
the 0
CIA 0
over 0
a 0
barrel. 0

As 0
I 0
indicated 0
in 0
my 0
two 0
articles 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
between 0
a 0
rock 0
and 0
a 0
hard 0
place. 0

On 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
it 0
could 0
refuse 0
to 0
grant 0
Trump 0
what 0
he 0
wanted 0
and 0
let 0
the 0
records 0
be 0
released, 0
which 0
it 1
knew 1
would 1
point 1
to 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
guilt 1
in 1
the 1
assassination. 1

On 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
it 0
could 0
give 0
Trump 0
what 0
he 0
wanted 0
and 0
have 0
to 0
suffer 0
the 1
obvious 1
inference 1
that 1
people 1
would 1
draw 1
— 1
that 1
the 1
CIA 1
was 1
continuing 1
to 1
cover 1
up 1
incriminatory 1
evidence. 1

What 0
did 0
the 0
CIA 0
give 0
Trump 0
in 0
return 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
extending 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
50-year-plus 0
secrecy? 0

We 0
don’t 0
know, 0
but 0
my 0
hunch 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
pertains 0
to 0
Russia. 0

Here’s 0
my 0
next 0
prediction: 0
the 0
congressional 0
investigations 0
into 0
Trump’s 0
supposed 0
“collusion” 0
with 0
Russia 0
are 0
about 0
to 0
fizzle 0
out. 0

That’s 0
because 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
CIA, 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
deal 0
with 0
Trump, 0
will 0
order 0
its 0
assets 0
in 0
Congress 0
to 0
cease 0
and 0
desist 0
with 0
respect 0
to 0
that 0
investigation. 0

In 0
my 0
opinion, 0
that’s 0
the 0
price 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
to 0
pay 0
in 0
return 0
for 0
its 0
continued 0
cover-up 0
of 0
its 0
U.S. 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
in 0
November 0
1963. 0

Notice 0
something 0
else 0
about 0
the 0
deal 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
presumably 0
made 0
with 0
the 0
CIA: 0
The 0
secrecy 0
arrangement 0
extends 0
only 0
to 0
April. 0

Ostensibly, 0
the 0
next 0
six 0
months 0
are 0
needed 0
to 0
carefully 0
review 0
the 0
records 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
records 0
really 0
to 0
relate 0
to 0
“national 0
security.” 0
Regime 0
Change: 0
The 0
JFK... 0
Jacob 0
Hornberger 0
Check 0

Not 0
surprisingly, 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
isn’t 1
even 1
questioning 1
that 1
ludicrous 1
notion. 1

For 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
years, 0
the 0
CIA 0
has 0
known 0
why 0
it 0
has 0
wanted 0
those 0
particular 0
records 0
to 0
be 0
kept 0
secret. 0

During 0
the 0
term 0
of 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board 0
in 0
the 0
1990s, 0
the 0
CIA 0
decided 0
to 0
keep 0
these 0
particular 0
records 0
secret 0
for 0
another 0
25 0
years. 0

There 0
are 0
bound 0
to 0
be 0
lots 0
of 0
CIA 0
memoranda 0
detailing 0
why 0
it 0
was 0
imperative 0
to 0
keep 0
these 0
particular 0
records 0
secret 0
for 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
possible. 0

Finally, 0
the 0
CIA 0
made 0
its 0
request 0
for 0
secrecy 0
to 0
Trump 0
at 0
least 0
several 0
weeks 0
ago. 0

The 0
notion 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
suddenly 0
hit 0
Trump 0
yesterday 0
with 0
a 0
new 0
argument 0
as 0
to 0
why 0
“national 0
security” 0
would 0
be 0
threatened, 0
after 0
Trump 0
had 0
supposedly 0
already 0
rejected 0
the 0
arguments 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
presented 0
to 0
him, 0
causing 0
Trump 0
to 0
suddenly 0
change 0
his 0
mind, 0
is, 1
well, 1
laughable. 1

So, 0
why 0
the 0
April 0
deadline? 0

Why 0
not 0
extend 0
the 0
secrecy 0
for 0
another 0
25 0
years, 0
which 0
is 0
undoubtedly 0
what 0
the 0
CIA 0
wanted? 0

Because 0
Trump 0
obviously 0
needed 0
collateral 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
complied 0
with 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
deal. 0

If 0
Trump 0
had 0
extended 0
the 0
secrecy 0
for 0
25 0
years, 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
lost 0
leverage 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
complied 0
with 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
bargain. 0

Let’s 0
say, 0
hypothetically, 0
that 0
I’m 0
right: 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
agreed 0
to 0
use 0
its 0
assets 0
in 0
Congress 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

To 0
make 0
certain 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
fulfills 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
bargain, 0
Trump 0
would 0
need 0
the 0
April 0
deadline 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
threat 0
of 0
the 0
records 0
release 0
would 0
continue 0
hanging 0
over 0
the 0
CIA. 0

If 0
the 0
CIA 0
fails 0
to 0
fulfill 0
its 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
bargain, 0
Trump 0
releases 0
the 0
records 0
in 0
April. 0

If 0
the 0
CIA 0
squelches 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigations, 0
Trump 0
grants 0
another 0
extension 0
of 0
time 0
in 0
April. 0

Let’s 1
state 1
the 1
obvious: 1
The 1
CIA 1
records 1
that 1
are 1
still 1
being 1
suppressed 1
have 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
“national 1
security.” 1
They 1
have 1
everything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
covering 1
up 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
role 1
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
national-security 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Dallas 0
in 0
November 0
1963, 0
which 0
succeeded 0
in 0
ousting 0
from 0
power 0
a 0

who 0

that 0
constituted 0
a 1
grave 1
threat 1
to 1
“national 1

i.e., 1
befriending 1

who 1
had 1
absolutely 1
no 1
motive 1
to 1

President 1
Kennedy, 1
the 0
national 0

did 0
have 0
motive, 0
a 0
powerful 0

the 1

that 1

to 1

other 1

Immediately 0
upon 0
the 0

of 0

Harvey 0
Oswald, 0
the 0
official 0
account 0
was 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
just 0
a 1
lone 1
nut, 1
former 1
U.S. 1
Marine 1
communist 1
who 0
decided, 0
for 0
no 0
apparent 0
reason, 0
to 0

Kennedy. 0

One 0
big 0
problem 0
is 0
the 0
official 0
story, 0
however, 0
requires 0
a 0
suspension 1

anyone 0
who 0

a 0

and 0
deference 0
to 0
authority, 0
that 0
story 0
makes 0
sense 0
because 0
nothing 0
is 0
questioned 0
or 0

For 1
anyone 1
who 1
has 1
a 1
critical, 1
analytical, 1

the 1
official 1
story 1
is 1
filled 1
with 1
holes. 1

For 0
example, 0
how 0
many 0
communist 0

have 0
you 0
ever 0
heard 0
of? 0

Why 0
would 0
a 0

join 0
the 0
Marines 0
in 0
the 0

especially 0
since 0
the 0
Marines 0
had 0
just 0
recently 0
killed 0
millions 0
of 0
North 0

Why 0
would 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist 0
join 0
the 0
Marines 0
knowing 0
that 0
he 0
could 0
be 0
called 0

Soon 0
after 0
the 0
Warren 0
Commission 0
was 0
established, 0
Warren 0
called 0
a 0
super-secret 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
to 0
address 0
information 0
that 0
had 0
come 0
into 0
Warren’s 0
possession. 0

That 0
information 0
was 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
actually 0
working 0
for 0
U.S. 0
intelligence. 0

Yes, 0
a 0
spy, 0
the 0
type 0
of 0
people 0
that 0
work 0
for 0
the 0
CIA. 0

That 0
would 0
make 0
sense, 0
especially 0
given 0
that 0
the 0
Marine 0
Corps 0
is 0
a 0
prime 0
recruiting 0
place 0
for 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Semper 0
fidelis! 0

Now, 0
suddenly, 0
all 0
the 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
in 0
the 0
Kennedy 0
assassination 0
falls 0
into 0
place. 0

It 0
begins 0
to 0
make 0
sense. 0

The 0
mosaic 0
starts 0
to 0
be 0
filled 0
out: 0
They 1
needed 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
Kennedy 1
to 1
protect 1
national 1
security 1
and 1
elevate 1
Johnson, 1
who 1
had 1
the 1
same 1
anti-communist 1
mindset 1
as 1
the 1
Pentagon 1
and 1
the 1
CIA, 1
to 1
the 1
presidency. 1

Unlike 0
JFK, 0
who 0
had 0
begun 0
withdrawing 0
troops 0
from 0
Vietnam, 0
Johnson 0
would 0

protect 0
national 0
security 0
by 0
sending 0
more 0
troops 0
to 0
Vietnam. 0

But 0
to 0
avoid 0
detection, 0
they 0
needed 0
a 0
patsy, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
term 0
that 0
Oswald 0
used 0
after 0
his 0
arrest. 0

They 0
needed 0
to 0
frame 0
someone 0
for 0
the 0
crime. 0

And 0
what 0
better 0
person 0
to 0
frame 0
than 0
a 0
communist 0
or 0
an 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
who 0
the 0
public 0
would 0
believe 0
was 0
a 0
communist? 0

Part 0
of 0
the 0
scheme, 0
obviously, 0
would 0
be 0
to 0
establish 0
Oswald’s 0
communist 0
bona 0
fides. 0

That’s 0
why 0
he 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
New 0
Orleans, 0
where, 0
contradictorily, 0
he 0
would 0
work 0
for 0
a 0
right-wing 0
business 0
owner, 0
work 0
with 0
a 0
right-wing 0
former 0
FBI 0
agent, 0
and 0
conduct 0
a 0
public 0
protest 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
Fidel 0
Castro 0
and 0
Cuba. 0

It 0
was 0
also 0
why 0
he 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
where 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
ordered 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
Cuban 0
and 0
Soviet 0
Embassies, 0
no 1
doubt 1
being 1
told 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
prepared 1
for 1
an 1
important 1
mission, 1
maybe 0
to 0
enter 0
Cuba 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Castro. 0

But 0
no 1
government 1
operation 1
ever 1
goes 1
perfectly. 1

Things 0
obviously 0
went 0
dreadfully 1
wrong 1
with 0
the 0
Mexico 0
City 0
operation 0
because 0
the 0
investigation 0
into 0
it 0
after 0
the 0
assassination 0
was 0
quickly 0
shut 0
down. 0

Today, 0
it 0
remains 0
shrouded 1
in 1
mystery. 1

And 0
guess 0
what 0
is 0
included 0
in 0
the 0
records 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
now 0
agreed 0
to 0
continue 0
suppressing. 0

You 0
guessed 0
it! 0

The 0
CIA’s 0
records 0
relating 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City! 0

Ever 0
since 0
the 0
assassination, 0
the 1
CIA 1
has 1
argued 1
that 1
the 1
release 1
of 1
any 1
of 1
its 1
JFK 1
records 1
would 1
threaten 1
“national 1
security.” 1
One 0
thing 0
is 0
for 0
sure 0
and 0
undeniable: 0
Despite 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
records 0
in 0
the 0
1990s 0
and 0
yesterday, 0
the 1
United 1
States 1
did 1
not 1
fall 1
into 1
the 1
ocean 1
or 1
fall 1
to 1
the 1
communists. 1

And 0
neither 0
would 0
it 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
if 0
Trump 0
had 0
not 0
granted 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
continued 0
cover-up 0
of 0
what 0
it 0
did 0
on 0

A 0

from 0
five 0
campus 0
Jewish 0
groups 0
says 0
the 0
report, 0
released 0
this 0
week 0
by 0
principal 0
Suzanne 0
Fortier, 0
“appears 0
to 0
condone 0
discrimination 0
against 0
Jewish 0
students 0
at 0
McGill 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
cultural 0
and 0
religious 0
organizations 0
they 0
affiliate 0
with.” 0

The 0
controversy 0
has 0
its 0
roots 0
in 0
McGill’s 0
long-running 0
debate 0
over 0
the 0
anti-Israel 0
Boycott, 0
Divestment 0
and 0
Sanctions 0
movement. 0

At 0
an 0
Oct. 0
23 0
general 0
assembly 0
of 0
the 0
Student 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University, 0
a 0
routine 0
motion 0
to 0
elect 0
a 0

of 0
directors 0
turned 0
contentious. 0

Supporters 0
of 0
a 0
group 0
called 0

formed 0
to 0
fight 0
a 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0

of 0
directors 0
declaring 0

counter 0
to 0
the 0
SSMU 0
constitution, 0
brought 0
a 0
motion 0
to 0
divide 0
the 0
election 0
vote. 0

In 0
the 0
past 0
they 0
had 0
been 0
ratified 0
as 0
a 0
bloc. 0

The 0
first 0
five 0
candidates 0
were 0
overwhelmingly 1
approved, 1
but 0
when 0
they 0
got 0
to 0
Lew, 0
the 0
only 0
Jewish 0
director, 0
he 0
was 0
rejected 0
105 0
to 0
73. 0

In 0
a 0
subsequent 0
Facebook 0
post, 0
Lew 0
wrote, 0
“My 1
Jewish 1
identity 1
was 1
now 1
public, 1
and 1
a 1

was 1
placed 1
squarely 1
upon 1
me 1
by 1
the 1
McGill 1

movement.” 1

An 1
outcry 1
followed, 0
leading 0
Fortier 0
to 0
appoint 0
former 0
Ombudsperson 0
for 0
Students, 0
Spencer 0

and 0
a 0

Boudreau 0
interviewed 0
38 0
students 0
over 0
his 0
three-and-a-half 0
week 0
investigation. 0

His 0
findings, 0
he 0
wrote, 0
do 0
“not 0
substantiate 0
the 0
notion 0
that 0
the 0
vote 0
was 0
motivated 0
by 0
anti-Semitism,” 0
which 0
he 0
defined 0
as 0

Boudreau’s 0
report 0
said 0
the 0

followed 0
the 0
assembly 0
vote, 0

in 0
fact 0
it 0

which 0
targeted 0
Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
candidates, 0
after 0
the 0
meeting 0
and 0
apologized 0
for 0
publishing 0
material 0
that 0
was 0
“insensitive 0
to 0
anti-Semitic 1
tropes 1
of 1
Jewish 1
people 1
as 0
corrupt 0
and 0
politically 0
powerful.” 0

The 1
Jewish 1
groups 1
said 1
this 1
anti-Semitic 1
rhetoric 1
“was 1
used 1
to 1
encourage 1
students 1
to 1
vote 1
specifically 1
against 1
Noah 1
Lew. 1

It 1
is 1
under 1
this 1
context 1
that 1
the 1
(general 1
assembly) 1
occurred, 1
and 1
the 1
report 1
fundamentally 1
misunderstands 1
this, 1
which 1
alters 1
the 1
entire 1
findings 1
of 1
the 1
report.” 1

They 0
say 0
Boudreau’s 0
report 0
“insinuates 0
that 0
Jewish 0
students 0
who 0
engage 0
with 0
mainstream 0
Jewish 0
community 0

are 0
permitted 0
to 0
be 0

Lew 0
was 0
restored 0
to 0
his 0
post 0
as 0
a 0
director 0
last 0
month 0
after 0
a 0

Michael 0

called 0
the 0

a 1
whitewash. 1

“The 0

Reid 0
Wilson, 0
a 0
correspondent 0
for 0
the 0
Hill, 0
has 0
posted 0
to 0
Twitter 0
a 0
year 0
by 0
year 0
breakdown 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
settlements 0
and 0
awards 0
that 0
he 0
received 0
from 0
the 0
Congressional 0
Office 0
of 0
Compliance. 0

I 0
went 0
ahead 0
and 0
added 0
up 0
each 0
column, 0
and 0
what 0
I 0
discovered 0
is 0
that 0
264 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
Congress 0
have 0
been 0
settled 0
since 0
1997, 0
and 0
the 0
total 0
amount 0
awarded 0
in 0
those 0
settlements 0
comes 0
to 0
a 0
grand 0
total 0
of 0
$17,250,854. 0

So 0
where 0
has 0
the 0
$17,250,854 0
come 0
from 0
to 0
pay 0
those 0
settlements? 0

That 1
money 1
has 1
come 1
from 1
the 1
taxpayers 1
of 1
course. 1

That 0
means 0
that 0
you 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
paying 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
the 1
epidemic 1
of 1
sexual 1
harassment 1
that 0
has 0
been 0
taking 0
place 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill. 0

When 0
U.S. 0
Representative 0
Jackie 0
Speier 0
originally 0
told 0
us 0
that 0
more 0
than 0
15 0
million 0
dollars 0
had 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
recent 0
years, 0
I 0
was 0
envisioning 0
a 0
few 0
dozen 0
cases 0
at 0
most. 0

I 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
that 0
the 0
total 0
number 0
of 0
cases 0
would 0
actually 0
be 0
well 0
over 0
200. 0

If 0
our 0
leaders 0
were 0
serious 0
about 0
stopping 0
this 0
from 0
happening, 0
they 0
would 0
pass 0
a 0
law 0
making 0
it 0
mandatory 0
that 0
all 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
Congress 0
be 0
made 0
public, 0
and 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
would 0
be 0
personally 0
responsible 0
for 0
paying 0
out 0
any 0
settlements. 0

If 1
such 1
a 1
law 1
was 1
instituted, 1
I 1
guarantee 1
you 1
that 1
sexual 1
harassment 1
on 1
Capitol 1
Hill 1
would 1
come 1
to 1
a 1
screeching 1
halt. 1

But 0
they 0
don’t 0
want 0
it 0
to 0
stop. 0

For 1
many 1
in 1
Congress, 1
having 1
so 1
many 1
attractive 1
young 1
women 1
around 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
key 1
benefits 1
of 1
the 1
job. 1

I 0
included 0
the 0
following 0
quote 0
from 0
CNN 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
the 0
other 0
day, 0
but 0
I 0
also 0
believe 0
that 0
it 0
fits 0
just 0
perfectly 0
here… 0

In 0
an 0
environment 0
with 0
“so 0
many 0
young 0
women,” 0
said 0
one 0
ex-House 0
aide, 0
the 1
men 1
“have 1
no 1
self-control.” 1
“Amongst 0
ourselves, 0
we 0
know,” 0
a 0
former 0
Senate 0
staffer 0
said 0
of 0
the 1
lawmakers 1
with 1
the 1
worst 1
reputations. 1

And 0
sometimes, 0
the 0
sexual 0
advances 0
from 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
or 0
senior 0
aides 0
are 0
reciprocated 0
in 0
the 0
hopes 0
of 0
advancing 0
one’s 0
career 0
— 0
what 0
one 0
political 0
veteran 0
bluntly 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
“sex 1
trade 1
on 1
Capitol 1
Hill.” 1

Do 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
from 0
happening? 0

It 1
isn’t 1
going 1
to 1
stop 1
until 1
we 1
boot 1
out 1
the 1
corrupt 1
career 1
politicians 1
that 1
are 1
engaging 1
in 1
this 1
type 1
of 1
behavior. 1

So 0
I 0
am 0
asking 0
you 0
to 0
support 0
my 0
campaign 0
and 0
other 0
“grassroots 1
deplorables” 1
that 0
are 0
running 0
for 0
office 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
nation. 0

Morality 0
really 0
matters 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
serving 0
in 0
public 0
office, 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
send 0
people 0
that 0
engage 0
in 0
sexually 0
inappropriate 0
behavior 0
to 0
Washington 0
anymore. 0

And 0
I 0
am 0
calling 0
on 0
Congress 0
to 0
immediately 0
release 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
264 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
settled 0
since 0
1997. 0

The 1
American 1
people 1
have 1
a 1
right 1
to 1
know, 1
and 0
those 0
that 0
engaged 0
in 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
behavior 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
hide. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
drain 0
the 0
swamp, 0
and 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
really 0
good 0
place 0

start. 0

Omar 0
defended 0
herself 0
against 0
charges 0
of 0
anti-Semitism 0
in 0
a 0
July 0
interview 0
with 0
ABC 0
News, 0
saying: 0
“These 0
accusations 0
are 0
without 0
merit. 0

They 1
are 1
rooted 1
in 1
bigotry 1
toward 1
a 1

about 1

The 0
oft-repeated 0
notion 0
that 0
Israel 0
is 0
an 0
“apartheid” 0
nation 0
is 0
incorrect 0
on 0
multiple 0
grounds. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
succinct 0
refutation 0
of 0
this 0
idea 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
Anti-Defamation 0

(ADL), 0
which 0
writes: 0

Recently, 0
I 0
received 0
a 0
newspaper 0
article 0
from 0
a 1
confused, 1
biblically 1
illiterate 1
friend 1
asking 0
me 0
what 0
my 0
take 0
was 0
on 0
an 0
article 0
titled, 0
“Scripture 0
teaches 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0

with 0
reference 0
to 0
Romans 0
Chapter 0

this 0

the 0
author 0
was 0
calling 0
out 0
a 0
Christian 0
for 0
protesting 0
a 0
corrupt 0
representative 0
in 0
government, 0
even 0
going 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
suggest 0
this 1
protestant 1
ought 1
to 1
have 1
stayed 1
home 1

their 1

rather 1

that 0

First 0
of 0
all, 0
the 0
authority 0
given 0
to 0
our 0

is 0
derived 0
from 0
“We 0

those 0

13: 0
1-7 0

Let 0
every 0
soul 0
be 0
subject 0
unto 0
the 0
higher 0
powers. 0

For 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
power 0
but 0
of 0
God: 0
the 0
powers 0
that 0
be 0
are 0
ordained 0
of 0
God. 0

Whosoever 1
therefore 1
resisteth 1
the 1
power, 1
resisteth 1
the 1
ordinance 1
of 1
God: 1
and 1
they 1
that 1
resist 1
shall 1
receive 1
to 1
themselves 1
damnation. 1

For 0
rulers 0
are 0
not 0
a 0
terror 0
to 0
good 0
works, 0
but 0
to 0
the 0
evil. 0

Wilt 0
thou 0
then 0
not 0
be 0
afraid 0
of 0
the 0
power? 0

do 0
that 0
which 0
is 0
good, 0
and 0
thou 0
shalt 0
have 0
praise 0
of 0
the 0
same: 0

For 0
he 0
is 0
the 0
minister 0
of 0
God 0
to 0
thee 0
for 0
good. 0

But 0
if 0
thou 0
do 0
that 0
which 0
is 0
evil, 0
be 0
afraid; 0
for 0
he 0
beareth 0
not 0
the 0
sword 0
in 0
vain: 0
for 0
he 0
is 0
the 1
minister 1
of 1
God, 1
a 1
revenger 1
to 1
execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
doeth 1
evil. 1

Wherefore 0
ye 0
must 0
needs 0
be 0
subject, 0
not 0
only 0
for 0
wrath, 0
but 0
also 0
for 0
conscience 0
sake. 0

For 0
for 0
this 0
cause 0
pay 0
ye 0
tribute 0
also: 0
for 0
they 0
are 0
God's 0
ministers, 0
attending 0
continually 0
upon 0
this 0

thing. 0

Render 0
therefore 0
to 0
all 0
their 0
dues: 0
tribute 0
to 0
whom 0
tribute 0

Did 0
God 0
tell 0
His 0
Church 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
that 0
which 0
He 0
condemns? 0

(Deuteronomy 0
25:1; 0
Proverbs 0
17:15) 0
Absolutely 1
not! 1

Is 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
transgress 0
His 0
Laws, 0
or 0
to 0
magnify 0
and 0
enforce 0
His 0
Laws 0
unto 0
judgment? 0

(Psalm 0
40:8; 0
Romans 0
3:31) 0
Of 1
course 1
not! 1

If 0
He 0
did, 0
that 0
would 0
make 0
God 0
unjust. 0

Jesus 0
said, 0
"Think 0
not 0
that 0
I 0
am 0
come 0
to 0
destroy 0
the 0
law, 0
or 0
the 0
prophets: 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
come 0
to 0
destroy, 0
but 0
to 0
fulfil” 0
(Matthew 0
5:17). 0

The 0
Lord 0
has, 0
in 0
fact, 0
commanded 0
nowhere 0
in 0
Scripture 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 0
wicked. 0

The 0
Bible 0
teaches 0
just 0
the 0
exact 0
opposite. 0

We 0
are 0
to 0
“have 0
no 0
fellowship 0
with 0
the 0
unfruitful 1
works 1
of 1
darkness, 1
but 0
rather 0
reprove 0
(expose) 0
them” 0
(Ephesians 0
5:11). 0

Furthermore, 0
it 0
would 0
contradict 0
what 0
Scripture 0
teaches 0
us 0
from 0
Genesis 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
Revelation 0
every 0
step 0
of 0
the 0
way. 0

Think 0
of 0
this: 0
Those 0
that 0
serve 0
“We 1
the 1
People,” 1
before 0
taking 0
office, 0
swear 0
to 0
uphold 0
the 0
US 0
Constitution 0
with 0
their 0
hand 0
on 0
the 0
Holy 0
Bible. 0

They 0
are 0
appointed 0
to 0
magnify 0
law 0
against 0
crime, 0
not 0
crime 0
against 0
the 0
law 0
(Psalm 0
94:20). 0

America 0
is 0
based 0
on 0
Common 0
Law, 0

Mosaic 0
Institution. 0

Read 0
the 0
5 0
books 0
of 0

“No 1
enactment 1
of 1
man 1
can 1
be 1
considered 1

unless 1
it 1
conforms 1
to 1
the 1
Law 1
of 1
God.” 1
–William 0
Blackstone, 0
English 0
Common 0
Law 0

Representatives 0
are 0
to 0
magnify 0
the 0
law, 0
not 0
tear 0
it 0
down; 0
and 0
yet, 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
the 1
biblically 1
illiterate 1
are 0
teaching 0
others 0
to 0
do, 0
submit 0
to 0
the 1
tyrants 1
and 0
resist 0
God, 0
His 0
Church 0
and 0
His 0
Word 0
(Micah 0
3:5). 0

I 1
ask, 1
are 1
Christians 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
sanctioned 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
the 1
innocent 1
in 1
the 1
womb 1
(Exodus 0
20:13; 0
Proverbs 0
6:17)? 0

Absolutely 1
not! 1

Are 1
Christians 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
redefined 1
marriage 1
where 1
a 1
man 1
can 1
now 1
"marry" 1
a 1
man 1
and 1
a 1
woman 1
can 1
now 1
"marry" 1
a 1
woman 1
(Leviticus 0
18:22; 0
Romans 0
1:24 0
etc…)? 0

Absolutely 1
not! 1

Submit 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
lie 1
continuously, 1
to 1
them 1
that 1
steal 1
and 1
even 1
kill? 1

Absolutely 1
not! 1

Submit 0
to 0
what 0
God 0
condemns? 0

Yet, 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
the 1
perverse, 1
modern-day, 1
professing 1
Christians 1
are 0
teaching 0
the 1
sheep 1
in 0
the 0
American 0
Church 0
today. 0

It 0
would 0
do 0
you 0
well 0
to 0
now 0
look 0
to 0
the 0
Christ 0
when 0
He 0
said 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
to 0
beware 0
of 0
the 0
leaven 0
of 0
the 0
Pharisee’s 0
(corrupt 0
doctrines 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
the 1
children 1
of 1
God), 1
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
leaven 0
of 0
Herod 0
(corrupt 0
doctrines 0
of 0
government) 0
(Mark 0
8:15). 0

If 0
you 0
remember, 0
it 0
was 0
those 0
same 0
people 0
who 0
called 0
for 0
the 0
crucifixion 0
of 0
Christ 0
while 0
crying 1
out 1
“We 0
have 0
no 0
King 0
but 0
Caesar” 0
(John 0
19:15). 0

Do 0
these 0
that 0
teach 1
such 1
heresy 1
not 0
realize 0
that 0
every 0
apostle, 0
except 0
John, 0
was 0
killed 0
by 0
hostile 1
corrupt 1
civil 1
authorities 1
opposed 0
to 0
their 0
endeavors? 0

Christians 0
throughout 0
history 0
were 0
imprisoned, 0
tortured, 0
or 0
killed 0
by 0
corrupt 1
civil 1
authorities 1
of 1
all 1
stripes 1
for 0
refusing 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
their 0
various, 0
lawless 0
policies 0
and 0
prohibitions. 0

Did 0
Christian 0
martyrs 0
violate 0
God’s 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
authority? 0

Of 1
course, 1
not. 1

Also, 0
keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
magistrates 0
have 0
limited 0
and 0
defined 0
authority 0
in 0
civil 0
matters. 0

Take 0
note 0
that 0
civil 0
government 0
is 0
to 0
be, 0
and 0
must 0
be, 0
a 1
“terror 1
to 1
good 1
works.” 1
It 0
has 0
no 0
power 0
or 0
authority 0
to 0
terrorize 0
good 0
works 0
or 0
good, 1
law-abiding 1
people. 1

God 0
never 0
gave 0
them 0
that 0
authority 0
and 0
any, 0
and 0
all, 0
government 0
that 0
oversteps 0
the 0
divine 0
authority 0
and 0
its 0
boundaries 0
has 0
no 0
divine 0
authority 0
or 0
protection. 0

Civil 0
government 0
is 0
a 0
“minister 0
for 0
God 0
to 0
thee 0
for 0
good” 0
(Romans 0
13:4). 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
minister 0
of 0
God 0
for 0
evil. 0

Civil 0
magistrates 0
have 0
a 0
divine 0
duty 0
to 0
“execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
him 1
that 1
doeth 1
evil.” 1
Anyone 1
who 1
teaches 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
authority 1
to 1
execute 1
wrath 1
upon 1
"him 1
that 1
doeth 1
good” 1
is 1
ignorant 1
and 1
uneducated 1
in 1
their 1
misleadings 1
(1 0
John 0
4:6). 0

To 0
tell 0
Christians 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
evil 1
civil 1
authority 1
is 0
teaching 0
the 0
opposite 0
of 0
what 0
is 0
true. 0

Common 0
sense 0
does 0
come 0
into 0
play 0
here. 0

I 0
ask, 0
did 0
Moses 0
violate 0
God's 0
principle 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
commanded 0
by 0
God, 0
“Go 0
in 0
unto 0
Pharaoh, 0
and 0
tell 0
him, 0
Thus 0
saith 0
the 1
LORD 1
God 1
of 1
the 1
Hebrews, 1
Let 0
my 0
people 0
go, 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
serve 0
me” 0
(Exodus 0
9:1). 0

And 0
when 0
Pharaoh 0
refused, 0
God 0
plagued 0
the 0
Pharaoh 0
and 0
the 0
Egyptians 0
and 0
set 0
His 0
children 0
free. 0

Think 0
of 0
this, 0
the 1
meekest 1
man 1
alive 1
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
Pharaoh 0
to 1
tell 1
him 1
to 1
obey 1
or 1
else. 1

Is 0
this 0
what 0
is 0
being 0
preached 0
from 0
the 0
pulpits 0
across 0
America 0
today? 0

Or 0
what 0
of 0
Gideon 0
who 0
was 0
to 0
deliver 0
the 0
Children 0
of 0
Israel 0
from 0
the 0
Midianites? 0

The 0
first 0
thing 0
the 0
Lord 0
commanded 0
him 0
to 0
do 0
was 0
to 0
tear 0
down 0
his 0
father's 0
altars 0
(Judges 0
6:25). 0

Was 0
this 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
God's 0
principles 0
of 0
submission? 0

The 0
sins 0
of 0
the 0
fathers 0
were 0
the 0
reason 0
the 0
Midianites 0
had 0
power 0
to 0
oppress 0
them. 0

What 0
of 0
that 0
lone 0
prophet, 0
Elijah? 0

The 1
tyrant 1
Ahab 0
called 0
him 0
the 1
troubler 1
of 1
Israel. 1

Elijah 0

this 0
a 0
violation 1
of 1
God's 1
principles 1
when 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
submission 0

What 0
of 0
King 0
David? 0

Was 0
he 0
violating 0
God’s 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
refused 0
to 0
surrender 0
himself 0
to 0
Saul’s 0
troops? 0

David 0
was 0
a 0
king 0
that 0
was 0
to 0
overthrow 0
corrupt 0
governments 0
by 0
dispossessing 0
them 0
and 0
establishing 0
righteousness 0
through 0
justice 0
and 0
judgment 0
(Jeremiah 0
23:5; 0

Did 0
Shadrach, 0

violate 0
God's 0
principle 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
worship 0
King 0
Nebuchadnezzar’s 0
image? 0

Then 0
the 0

the 0

and 0
captains, 0
the 0

the 0

the 0

all 0
the 0

were 0

the 0

that 0
Nebuchadnezzar 0
the 0

up; 0
and 0
they 0
stood 0
before 0
the 0
image 0
that 0
Nebuchadnezzar 0
had 0
set 0
up. 0

Then 0
an 0
herald 0
cried 1
aloud, 1
To 0
you 0
it 0
is 0
commanded, 0
O 0
people, 0
nations, 0

That 0
at 0

ye 0

down 0
and 0
worship 0
the 0
golden 0

that 0
Nebuchadnezzar 0
the 0
king 0
hath 0
set 0
up: 0

And 0
whoso 1
falleth 1
not 1
down 1
and 1
worshippeth 1
shall 1
the 1
same 1
hour 1
be 1
cast 1
into 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
burning 1
fiery 1
furnace. 1

Daniel 0
3:3-6 0

When 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 1
tyrant, 1
the 0
furnace 0
was 0
heated 0
up 0
7 0
times 0
hotter 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
guards 0
were 0
consumed, 0
only 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
fourth 0
man, 0
“like 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
man,” 0
show 0
up 0
to 0

them 0
where 0
the 0
fire 0
had 0
no 0
power 0
over 0
them, 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
hair 0
of 0
their 0
heads 0
was 0
singed. 0

In 0
the 0
end, 0
Only 0
the 1
corrupt 1
king 1
acknowledges 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Shadrach, 0
Meshach, 0
and 0
Abednego. 0

“Blessed 0
be 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Shadrach, 0
Meshach, 0
and 0
Abednego, 0
who 0
hath 0
sent 0
his 0
angel, 0
and 0
delivered 0
his 0
servants 0
that 0
trusted 0
in 0
him, 0
and 0
have 0
changed 0
the 0
king's 0
word, 0
and 0
yielded 0
their 0
bodies, 0
that 0
they 0
might 0
not 0
serve 0
nor 0
worship 0
any 0
god, 0
except 0
their 0
own 0
God.” 0
Daniel 0
3:28 0

Did 0
Daniel 0
violate 0
God's 0
principles 0

when 0
he 0
disobeyed 0
the 0
king's 0
order 0
to 0
stop 0
praying 0
to 0
any 0
god 0
but 0
himself? 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
the 0
punishment 0
was 0
that 0
Daniel 0
was 0
thrown 0
into 0
a 0
den 0
of 0
lions 0
in 0
which 0
God 0
sent 0
forth 0
an 0
angel 0
to 0
protect 0
him. 0

His 0
accusers 0
were 0
then 0
thrown 0
into 0
the 0
den 0
and 0
devoured 0
by 0
the 0
very 0
lions 0
that 0
they 0
meant 0
to 0
have 0
devoured 0
Daniel 0
(Daniel 0
6). 0

What 0
of 0
Jeremiah? 0

Was 0
he 0
violating 0
God's 0
principles 0
of 0
submission 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
preach 0
repentance 0
to 0
the 0
corrupt 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
corrupt 0
kings? 0

For, 0
behold, 0
I 0
have 0
made 0
thee 0
this 0
day 0
a 0
defenced 0
city, 0
and 0
an 0
iron 0
pillar, 0
and 0
brasen 0

against 0
the 0

against 0

Jeremiah 0
1:18 0

Don’t 0
forget 0
about 0
Amos, 0
who 0
was 0
prophesying 0
judgment 0
upon 0
the 1
corrupt 1
priests 1
and 1
the 1
corrupt 1
king 1
of 0
his 0
day 0
(Amos 0
7:10-16). 0

Was 0
that 0
violating, 0
or 0
fulfilling 0
God's 0
principles 0
and 0
purposes? 0

What 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Testament? 0

John 0
the 0
Baptist 0
points 0
out 0
all 1
of 1
the 1
evils 1
of 0
King 0
Herod 0
(Luke 0
3:19). 0

Was 0
this 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
civil 0
government? 0

No, 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
rebuke 0
to 0
corruption 0
in 0
government 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 0
God 0
of 0
Abraham, 0
Isaac 0
and 0
Jacob 0
and 0
His 0
laws. 0

Is 0
it 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
God's 0
principles 0
to 0
keep 0
preaching, 0
“Repent, 0
and 0
be 0
baptized 0
every 0
one 0
of 0
you 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
for 0
the 0
remission 0
of 0
sins…”? 0

Absolutely 1
not! 1

The 1
corrupt 1
Pharisees 1
along 0
with 0
corrupt 1
government 1
did 0
the 0
opposite. 0

“Being 0
grieved 0
that 0
they 0
taught 0
the 0
people, 0
and 0
preached 0
through 0
Jesus 0
the 0
resurrection 0
from 0
the 0
dead. 0

And 0
they 0
laid 0
hands 0
on 0
them, 0
and 0
put 0
them 0
in 0
hold 0
unto 0
the 0
next 0
day: 0
for 0
it 0
was 0
now 0
eventide. 0

Howbeit 0
many 0
of 0
them 0
which 0
heard 0
the 0
word 0
believed; 0
and 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
was 0
about 0
five 0
thousand. 0

And 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
pass 0
on 0
the 0
morrow, 0
that 0
their 0
rulers, 0
and 0
elders, 0
and 0
scribes, 0
and 0
Annas 0
the 0
high 0
priest, 0
and 0
Caiaphas, 0
and 0
John, 0
and 0
Alexander, 0
and 0
as 0
many 0
as 0
were 0
of 0
the 0
kindred 0
of 0
the 0
high 0
priest, 0
were 0
gathered 0
together 0
at 0
Jerusalem. 0

And 0
when 0
they 0
had 0
set 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
midst, 0
they 0
asked, 0
By 0
what 0
power, 0
or 0
by 0
what 0
name, 0
have 0
ye 0
done 0
this? 0

Then 0
Peter, 0
filled 0
with 0
the 0
Holy 0
Ghost, 0
said 0
unto 0
them, 0
Ye 0
rulers 0
of 0
the 0
people, 0
and 0
elders 0
of 0
Israel, 0

If 0
we 0
this 0
day 0
be 0
examined 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
deed 0
done 0
to 0
the 1
impotent 1
man, 1
by 0
what 0
means 0
he 0
is 0
made 0
whole; 0

Be 0
it 0
known 0
unto 0
you 0
all, 0
and 0
to 0
all 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Israel, 0
that 0
by 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
of 0
Nazareth, 0
whom 0
ye 0
crucified, 0
whom 0
God 0
raised 0
from 0
the 0
dead, 0
even 0
by 0
him 0
doth 0
this 0
man 0
stand 0
here 0
before 0
you 0
whole. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
stone 0
which 0
was 0
set 0
at 0
nought 0
of 0
you 0
builders, 0
which 0
is 0
become 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
corner. 0

Neither 0
is 0
there 0
salvation 0
in 0
any 0
other: 0
for 0
there 0
is 0
none 0
other 0
name 0
under 0
heaven 0
given 0
among 0
men, 0
whereby 0
we 0
must 0
be 0
saved. 0

Now 0
when 0
they 0
saw 0
the 0
boldness 0
of 0
Peter 0
and 0
John, 0
and 0
perceived 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
unlearned 1
and 1
ignorant 1
men, 1
they 0
marvelled; 0
and 0
they 0
took 0
knowledge 0
of 0
them, 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
been 0
with 0
Jesus. 0

And 0
beholding 0
the 0
man 0
which 0
was 0
healed 0
standing 0
with 0
them, 0
they 0
could 0
say 0
nothing 0
against 0
it. 0

But 0
when 0
they 0
had 0
commanded 0
them 0
to 0
go 0
aside 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
council, 0
they 0
conferred 0
among 0
themselves, 0

Saying, 0
What 0
shall 0
we 0
do 0
to 0
these 0
men? 0

for 0
that 0
indeed 0
a 0
notable 0
miracle 0
hath 0
been 0
done 0
by 0
them 0
is 0
manifest 0
to 0
all 0
them 0
that 0
dwell 0
in 0
Jerusalem; 0
and 0
we 0
cannot 0
deny 0
it. 0

But 0
that 0
it 0
spread 0
no 0
further 0
among 0
the 0
people, 0
let 0
us 0
straitly 0
threaten 0
them, 0
that 0
they 0
speak 0
henceforth 0
to 0
no 0
man 0
in 0
this 0
name. 0

And 0
they 0
called 0
them, 0
and 0
commanded 0
them 0
not 0
to 0
speak 0
at 0
all 0
nor 0
teach 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jesus. 0

But 0
Peter 0
and 0
John 0
answered 0
and 0
said 0
unto 0
them, 0
Whether 0
it 0
be 0
right 0
in 0
the 0
sight 0
of 0
God 0
to 0
hearken 0
unto 0
you 0
more 0
than 0
unto 0
God, 0
judge 0
ye. 0

For 0
we 0
cannot 0
but 0
speak 0
the 0
things 0
which 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
and 0
heard.” 0
Acts 0
4:2-20 0

Or 0
what 0
of 0
the 0
account 0
found 0
in 0
Acts 0
12:1-11, 0
where 0
the 0
Lord 0
sent 0
an 0
Angel 0
to 0
liberate 0
Peter 0
from 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
tyrants. 1

“Now 0
about 0
that 0
time 0
Herod 0
the 0
king 0
stretched 0
forth 0
his 0
hands 0
to 0
vex 0
certain 0
of 0
the 0
church. 0

And 0
he 0
killed 0
James 0
the 0
brother 0
of 0
John 0
with 0
the 0
sword. 0

And 0
because 0
he 0
saw 0
it 0
pleased 0
the 0
Jews, 0
he 0
proceeded 0
further 0
to 0
take 0
Peter 0
also. 0

(Then 0
were 0
the 0
days 0
of 0
unleavened 0
bread.) 0

And 0
when 0
he 0
had 0
apprehended 0
him, 0
he 0
put 0
him 0
in 0
prison, 0
and 0
delivered 0
him 0
to 0
four 0
quaternions 0
of 0
soldiers 0
to 0
keep 0
him; 0
intending 0
after 0
Easter 0
to 0
bring 0
him 0
forth 0
to 0
the 0
people. 0

Peter 0
therefore 0
was 0
kept 0
in 0
prison: 0
but 0
prayer 0
was 0
made 0
without 0
ceasing 0
of 0
the 0
church 0
unto 0
God 0
for 0
him. 0

And 0
when 0
Herod 0
would 0
have 0
brought 0
him 0
forth, 0
the 0
same 0
night 0
Peter 0
was 0
sleeping 0
between 0
two 0
soldiers, 0
bound 0
with 0
two 0
chains: 0
and 0
the 0
keepers 0
before 0
the 0
door 0
kept 0
the 0
prison. 0

And, 0
behold, 0
the 0
angel 0
of 0
the 0
Lord 0
came 0
upon 0
him, 0
and 0
a 0
light 0
shined 0
in 0
the 0
prison: 0
and 0
he 0
smote 0
Peter 0
on 0
the 0
side, 0
and 0
raised 0
him 0
up, 0
saying, 0
Arise 0
up 0
quickly. 0

And 0
his 0
chains 0
fell 0
off 0
from 0
his 0
hands. 0

And 0
the 0
angel 0
said 0
unto 0
him, 0
Gird 0
thyself, 0
and 0
bind 0
on 0
thy 0
sandals. 0

And 0
so 0
he 0
did. 0

And 0
he 0
saith 0
unto 0
him, 0
Cast 0
thy 0
garment 0
about 0
thee, 0
and 0
follow 0
me. 0

And 0
he 0
went 0
out, 0
and 0
followed 0
him; 0
and 0
wist 0
not 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
true 0
which 0
was 0
done 0
by 0
the 0
angel; 0
but 0
thought 0
he 0
saw 0
a 0
vision. 0

When 0
they 0
were 0
past 0
the 0
first 0
and 0
the 0
second 0
ward, 0
they 0
came 0
unto 0
the 0
iron 0
gate 0
that 0
leadeth 0
unto 0
the 0
city; 0
which 0
opened 0
to 0
them 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
accord: 0
and 0
they 0
went 0
out, 0
and 0
passed 0
on 0
through 0
one 0
street; 0
and 0
forthwith 0
the 0
angel 0
departed 0
from 0
him. 0

And 0
when 0
Peter 0
was 0
come 0
to 0
himself, 0
he 0
said, 0
Now 0
I 0
know 0
of 0
a 0
surety, 0
that 0
the 0
Lord 0
hath 0
sent 0
his 0
angel, 0
and 0
hath 0
delivered 0
me 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
Herod, 0
and 0
from 0
all 0
the 0
expectation 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
the 0
Jews.” 0

Over 0
and 0
over 0
again, 0
you 0
can 0
see 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
was 0
to 0
stand 0
in 0
protest 0
against 0
the 1
wicked 1
that 1
were 1
at 1
war 1
with 1
Christ 1
(Revelation 0
12:17), 0
in 0
dealing 0
with 0
not 0
only 0
the 1
corrupt 1
and 1
wicked 1
priests, 1
but 0
also 0
the 1
corrupt 1
and 1
wicked 1
in 1
government. 1

as 0
well 0
as 0
those 0
who 0
submitted 0
to 0
such. 0

It 0
is 0
important 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
know 0
the 0
Scriptures 0
(History), 0
lest 0
you 0
find 0
yourselves 0
to 0
be 0
fighting 0
against 0
God 0
(Acts 0
5:39). 0

Nowhere 0
in 0
Scripture 0
can 0
you 0
find 0
the 0
Lord 0
telling 0
His 0
children 0
to 0
submit 0
to 0
the 0
wicked 0
in 0
disobedience 0
to 0
His 0
Word. 0

Nowhere! 1

Furthermore, 1
the 1
individual 1
that 1
wrote 1
the 1
article 1
teaching 1
people 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
authorities 1
might 1
want 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
time 1
to 1
read 1
Romans 1
12:21 1
before 1
perverting 1
and 1
twisting 1
Romans 1
13, 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
next 1
time 1
he 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
guilty 1
of 1
twisting 1
Scripture 1
the 1
way 1

Acta 0
Apostolicae 0
Sedis 0
(AAS)—the 0
Vatican's 0
organ 0
for 0
promulgating 0
the 0
Official 0
Acts 0
of 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
See—published 0
Pope 0
Francis' 0
October 0
2016 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
praised 0
their 0
episcopal 0
guidelines 0
allowing 0
divorced 0
and 0
civilly 0
remarried 0
Catholics 0
to 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
in 0
some 0
cases 0
while 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
objective 0
mortal 0
sin. 0

If 0
papal 0
clarification 0
was 0
ever 0
needed 0
on 0
the 0
long-debated 0
issue 0
of 0
the 0
intended 0
meaning 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
chapter 0
VIII, 0
such 0
clarification 0
has 0
now 0
been 0
provided 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
at 0
large. 0

Concerning 0
these 0
guidelines 0
that 0
allow 0
"the 0
possibility 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist" 0
in 0
"complex 0
circumstances" 0
where 0
"limitations 0
that 0
lessen 0
the 0
responsibility 0
and 0
guilt" 0
permit 0
adulterous 0
couples 0
to 0
continue 0
in 0
adultery, 0
the 0
pope 0
said 0
in 0
his 0
letter: 0

"The 1
document 1
is 1
very 1
good 1
and 1
completely 1
explains 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
chapter 1
VIII 1
of 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia. 1

There 1
are 1
no 1
other 1
interpretations." 1

Until 0
now, 0
the 0
pope's 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
Argentinian 0
bishops 0
had 0
been 0
considered 0
a 0
private 0
letter 0
with 0
no 0
binding 0
force, 0
whereas 0
AAS 0
has 0
now 0
elevated 0
Pope 0
Francis' 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
magisterial 0
status 0
of 0
an 0
"Apostolic 0
Letter," 0
while 0
including 0
a 0
special 0
rescript 0
as 0
an 0
addendum 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Pietro 0
Parolin, 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

The 0
rescript 0
declares 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
expressly 0
intends 0
both 0
documents—the 0
papal 0
letter 0
and 0
the 0
episcopal 0
guidelines—to 0
bear 0
the 0
character 0
of 0
his 0
"authentic 0
Magisterium," 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
has 0
personally 0
ordered 0
their 0
publication 0
in 0
AAS 0
and 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website. 0

Hence 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
VIII, 0
which 0
proposes 0
that 0
people 0
living 0
in 0
adultery 0
can 0
be 0
guiltless 0
and 0
thus 0
be 0
admitted 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Confession 0
and 0
Communion 0
when 0
"concrete 0
circumstances" 0
make 0
it 0
difficult 0
to 0
renounce 0
their 0
adulterous 0
state, 0
is 0
now 0
declared 0
"magisterial" 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
is 0
that 0
heresy 0
or 0
sacrilege 0
can 0
never 0
be 0
declared 0
magisterial, 0
so 0
that 0
if 0
it 0
is, 0
it 0
not 0
only 0
has 0
no 0
binding 0
force, 0
but 0
the 0
faithful 0
are 0
obliged 0
to 0
resist 0
and 0
refute 0
such 0
a 0
declaration. 0

St. 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas 0
says 0
in 0
his 0
Summa 0
Theologiae: 0
"If 0
the 0
faith 0
were 0
endangered, 0
a 0
subject 0
ought 0
to 0
rebuke 0
his 0
prelate 0
[pope] 0
even 0
publicly." 0

The 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
this 0
latest 0
promulgation 0
is 0
counter-magisterial, 0
but 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
his 0
right-hand 0
man 0
now 0
feel 0
they 0
have 0
enough 0
support 0
from 0
the 0
dissenting 0
left 0
that 0
enables 0
them 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
with 0
it. 0

Cardinal 0
Parolin's 0
rescript 0
on 0
the 0
papal 0
and 0
episcopal 0
documents 0
reads 0
as 0
follows: 0

Rescript 0
"from 0
an 0
Audience 0
with 0
His 0
Holiness" 0

The 0
Supreme 0
Pontiff 0
decreed 0
that 0
the 0
two 0
preceding 0
documents 0
be 0
promulgated 0
through 0
publication 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website 0
and 0
in 0
Acta 0
Apostolicae 0
Sedis, 0
as 0
authentic 0
Magisterium. 0

From 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Palace, 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
June 0
5 0
in 0
the 0
year 0
2017 0

Pietro 0
Card. 0

Parolin 0

Secretary 0
of 0
State 0

The 0
Catholic 0
Encyclopedia 0
defines 0
a 0
papal 0
rescript 0
as 0
follows: 0
"Rescripts 0
are 0
responses 0
of 0
the 0
pope 0
or 0
a 0
Sacred 0
Congregation, 0
in 0
writing, 0
to 0
queries 0
or 0
petitions 0
of 0
individuals. 0

Some 0
rescripts 0
concern 0
the 0
granting 0
of 0
favors; 0
others 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
justice, 0
e.g. 0

the 0
interpretation 0
of 0
a 0
law." 0

It 0
appears 0
then 0
that 0
Parolin's 0
rescript 0
constitutes 0
a 0
direct 0
reply 0
to 0
the 0
dubia 0
of 0
the 0
Four 0
Cardinals. 0

Pope 0
Francis' 0
praise 0
of 0
the 0
episcopal 0
guidelines 0
clearly 0
answers 0
the 0
cardinals' 0
query 0
concerning 0
his 0
intention 0
in 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
VIII, 0
so 0
will 0
Cardinals 0
Brandmuller 0
and 0
Burke 0
now 0
proceed 0
to 0
issue 0
the 0
formal 0
correction 0
of 0
it? 0

As 0
reported 0
in 0
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope—a 0
remarkable 0
new 0
book 0
which 0
provides 0
an 0
inside 0
look 0
at 0
the 1
most 1
tyrannical 1
and 1
unprincipled 1
papacy 1
of 1
recent 1
history—English 1
Cardinal 0
Cormac 0
Murphy 0
O’Connor 0
who 0
was 0
largely 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
vote 0
canvassing 0
behind 0
Francis' 0
election 0
told 0
journalist 0
Paul 0
Valley 0
in 0
2013, 0
"Four 0
years 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
change 0
things." 0

Each 0
day, 0
we 0
see 0
new 0
evidence 0
that 0
this 0
might 0
have 0
been 0
a 1
gross 1
understatement. 1

We 0
shouldn't 0
rule 0
out 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
Francis 0
may 0
come 0
forward 0
one 0
day 0
and 0
declare 0
"ex-cathedra" 0
that 0
the 0
interpretation 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
VIII, 0
as 0
now 0
taught 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See, 0
is 0
promulgated 0
as 0
"extraordinary 0
magisterium." 0

Should 0
this 0
happen, 0
the 1
Mystical 1
Body 1
would 1
then 1
be 1
without 1
its 1
head. 1

In 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
Catholic 0
World 0
Report 0
(CWR) 0
in 0
December 0
2016, 0
Cardinal 0
Raymond 0
Burke, 0
who 0
is 0
presently 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura, 0
said 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
pope 0
were 0
to 0
"formally 0
profess 0
heresy 0
he 0
would 0
cease, 0
by 0
that 0
act, 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
Pope." 0

Burke 0
was 0
reiterating 0
Church 0
teaching, 0
as 0
expressed 0
by 0
famed 0
canonist 0
Franz 0
Wernz 0
in 0
his 0
Ius 0
Canonicum: 0
"In 0
sum, 0
it 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
said 0
clearly 0
that 0
a 0
[publicly] 0
heretical 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
loses 0
his 0
power 0
upon 0
the 0
very 0
fact." 0

Two 0
DREAMERs 0
Caught 0
Smuggling 0
Illegal 0
Aliens 0

Or 0
rather, 0
"Two 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
caught 0
smuggling 0
less 1
glamorous 1
illegal 0
aliens." 0

The 0
distinction 0
between 0
the 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
who 0
benefited 0
from 0
Obama's 0
illegal 0
amnesty 0
and 0
other 0
illegals 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
rhetoric, 0
not 0
substance. 0

And 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
are 0
not 0
a 0
racial 0
or 0
ethnic 0
group. 0

They're 0
an 0
industry: 0
an 0
economic 0
industry 0
and 0
a 0
political 0
industry. 0

If 0
you 0
legalize 0
them, 0
you 1
move 1
closer 1
to 1
legalizing 1
all 1
illegals. 1

Meanwhile 0
DREAMERs 0
continue 0
violating 0
the 0
law. 0

In 0
more 0
ways 0
than 0
one. 0

Customs 0
and 0
Border 0
Protection 0
said 0
the 0
first 0
smuggling 0
attempt 0
was 0
broken 0
up 0
on 0
Oct. 0
4, 0
after 0
Border 0
Patrol 0
agents 0
stopped 0
a 0
car 0
at 0
a 0
checkpoint 0
on 0
Interstate 0
35 0
and 0
discovered 0
two 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
from 0
Brazil 0
hiding 0
in 0
the 0
trunk. 0

The 0
driver 0
of 0
the 0
car 0
was 0
from 0
Guatemala, 0
a 0
juvenile 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
approved 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
for 0
a 0
DACA 0
permit 0
in 0
2016. 0

Three 0
days 0
later 0
the 0
same 0
checkpoint 0
snared 0
another 0
DACA 0
recipient 0
from 0
Mexico 0
smuggling 0
an 0
illegal 0
immigrant 0
from 0
Mexico 0
in 0
his 0
trunk. 0

Neither 0
of 0
the 0
Dreamers’ 0
names 0
were 0
released. 0

They 0
and 0
the 0
illegal 0
immigrants 0
they 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
smuggle 0
are 0
all 0
being 0

Homeschooling 0
Expands 0
As 0
Parents 0
Seethe 0
Over 0
Liberal 0
Social 0
Engineering 0
And 0
Violence 1

Homeschooling 0
rates 0
are 0
skyrocketing 1
as 0
parents 0
are 0
continually 0
getting 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
upset 0
at 0
the 0
leftist 1
social 1
engineering 1
taking 0
place 0
in 0
public 0
schools. 0

The 0
indoctrination 1
is 0
getting 0
so 1
bad, 1
that 0
some 0
parents 0
are 0
even 0
concerned 1
about 0
liberal 0
violence 1
against 0
those 0
who 0
reject 0
the 0
brainwashing. 1

According 0
to 0
The 0
Washington 0
Times, 0
the 0
recent 0
school 0
shooting 0
at 0
Parkland, 0
Florida, 0
was 0
the 0
last 0
straw 0
for 0
scores 0
of 0
parents. 0

The 0
paper 0
noted 0
that 0
“the 0
phones 0
started 0
ringing 0
at 0
the 0
Texas 0
Home 0
School 0
Coalition, 0
and 0
they 0
haven’t 0
stopped 0
yet.” 0

“When 0
the 0
Parkland 0
shooting 0
happened, 0
our 0
phone 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
exploded,” 1
said 0
coalition 0
president 0
Tim 0
Lambert. 0

“In 0
the 0
last 0
couple 0
of 0
months, 0
our 0
numbers 0
have 0
doubled. 0

We’re 0
dealing 0
with 0
probably 0
between 0
1,200 0
and 0
1,400 0
calls 0
and 0
emails 0
per 0
month, 0
and 0
prior 0
to 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
600 0
to 0
700.” 0
But 0
according 0
to 0
Natural 0
News, 0
it 0
isn’t 0
just 0
the 0
rampant 1
violence 1
worrying 0
some 0
parents. 0

That’s 0
just 0
the 0
tip 0
of 0
the 0
collectivist 0
agenda 0
iceberg. 0

Christopher 0
Chin, 0
head 0
of 0
Homeschool 0
Louisiana, 0
told 0
The 0
Times 0
that 0
parents 0
are 0
fed 0
up 0
with 0
“the 0
violence, 1
the 0
bullying, 1
the 0
unsafe 0
environments.” 0
Many 0
parents 0
are 0
also 0
disturbed 1
by 0
the 0
social 1
engineering, 1
which 0
amounts 0
to 0
brainwashing 1
and 0
indoctrination 1
that 0
goes 0
on 0
in 0
a 0
public 0
school. 0

For 0
example, 0
a 0
Minnesota 0
public 0
school 0
is 0
forcing 1
Kindergarten 0
students 0
to 0
study 0
‘white 0
privilege’. 0

The 0
left-wing 0
curriculum 0
and 0
common 0
core 0
are 0
also 0
driving 0
parents 0
to 0
remove 0
their 0
children 0
from 0
public 0
schools. 0

Brian 0
D. 0
Ray, 0
who 0
heads 0
up 0
the 0
National 0
Home 0
Education 0
Research 0
Institute, 0
in 0
Salem, 0
Oregon, 0
who’s 0
conducted 0
homeschooling 0
research 0
for 0
33 0
years, 0
told 0
The 0
Times 0
that 0
concern 1
over 0
school 0
curriculum 0
has 0
reached 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
charts 0
for 0
most 0
parents. 0

Ray 0
said 0
the 0
top 0
three 0
reasons 0
that 0
parents 0
choose 0
homeschooling 0
are 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
provide 0
religious 0
instruction 0
or 0
different 0
values 0
than 0
those 0
offered 0
in 0
public 0
schools; 0
dissatisfaction 0
with 0
the 0
academic 0
curriculum, 0
and 0
worries 0
about 0
the 0
school 0
environment. 0

Since 0
teachers 0
are 0
not 0
allowed 0
to 0
arm 0
themselves 0
to 0
defend 0
their 0
students 0
against 0
the 0
violence 1
often 0
perpetrated 0
at 0
schools 0
simply 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
gun 0
free 0
zones, 0
homeschooling 0
takes 0
care 0
of 0
that 0
problem. 0

“Most 0
parents 0
homeschool 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
reason,” 0
Ray 0
told 0
the 0
paper. 0

“But 0
when 0
we 0
ask 0
families 0
why 0
do 0
they 0
homeschool, 0
near 0
the 0
top 0
nowadays 0
is 0
concern 1
about 0
the 0
environment 0
of 0
schools, 0
and 0
that 0
includes 0
safety, 0
pressure 0
to 0
get 0
into 0
drugs, 0
pressure 0
to 0
get 0
into 0
sexual 0
activity. 0

It 0
includes 0
all 0
of 0
that.” 0

Indoctrination 1
means 0
to 0
teach 0
a 0
person 0
to 0
accept 0
a 0
belief 0
uncritically. 0

It’s 1
the 1
very 1
reason 1
the 1
governments 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
still 1
exist. 1

People 0
cannot 0
logically 0
and 0
critically 0
understand 0
that 0
hurting 0
people 0
and 0
taking 0
their 0
things 0
is 0
wrong 0
– 0
even 0
if 0
people 0
who 0
declare 0
themselves 0
government 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
doing 0
it. 0

Governments 1
are 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
handful 1
of 1
people 1
and 0
have 0
no 0
right 0
to 0
aggress 0
against 0
others. 0

But 0
humans 0
are 0
taught 0
at 0
a 0
young 0
age 0
to 0
never 0
question 0
this 0
and 0
that 0
belief 0
has 0
kept 0
most 0
of 0
humanity 0
enslaved 1
for 0
centuries. 0

﻿ 0

It 0
isn’t 0
a 0
surprise 0
that 0
so 0
many 0
have 0
decided 0
to 0
educate 0
their 0
children 0
themselves. 0

And 0
as 0
schools 0
continue 0
to 0
fail, 0
and 0
authoritarian 1
policies 0
continue 0
to 0
wreak 1
havoc 1
on 0
our 1
society, 1
more 0
will 0
wake 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
absolute 1
horror 1
of 0
what 0
allowing 0
the 0
state 0
to 0
educate 0
our 0
children 0
has 0
done 0
to 0
the 0
moral 0
fabric 0
of 0
humanity. 0

The 0
Case 0

made 0
to 0
write 0
out 0
the 0
Shahada, 0
which 0
states: 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
god 0
but 0
Allah, 0
and 0
Muhammad 0
is 0
the 0
messenger 0
of 0
Allah.”This 0
is 0
exactly 0
what 0
I 0
warned 0
about 0
in 0
my 0
book, 0
Stop 1
the 1
Islamization 1
of 1
America: 1
A 0
Practical 0
Guide 0

Resistance 0
, 0
in 0
the 0
chapter 0
“The 0
Mosqueing 0

Public 0
Schools.”In 0
order 1
to 1
convert 1
to 1
Islam, 1
one 1
says 1
the 1
shahada. 1

Saying 1
the 1
shahada 1
makes 1
you 1
a 1
Muslim. 1

The 1
shahada 1
is 1
what 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
black 1
flag 1
of 1
jihad. 1

No 0
non-Muslim 0
student 0
should 0
be 0
forced 0
to 0
write 0
or 0
say 0
the 0
shahada 0
without 0
the 0
qualifier 0
“Muslims 0
believe 0
that…” 0
This 0
is 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
statement 0
of 0
faith. 0

If 0
the 0
school 0
exercise 0
is 0
requiring 0
students 0
to 0
write 0
it, 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
clear 0
from 0
the 0
wording 0
of 0
the 0
exercise 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
Islamic 0
faith, 0
not 0
the 0
student’s 0
faith. 0

That 0
distinction 0
has 0
been 0
glossed 0
over 0
in 0
many, 0
many 0
school 0
textbook 0
presentations. 0

This 0
is 0
in 0
West 0
Virginia, 0
not 0
Baghdad. 0

And 0
it’s 0
a 0
problem 0
not 0
just 0
in 0
West 0
Virginia 0
– 0
it’s 0
a 1

the 0

of 0
a 0
Mountain 0

contacted 0

explained 0
the 0

the 0

gave 0
out 0
for 0
the 0
Jewish 0
and 0
the 0

Furthermore 0
the 0
principal 0
of 0
Mountain 0
Ridge 0
Middle 0
School 0
Dr. 0

Branch 0
has 0
used 0
my 0
words 0
against 0
me 0
by 0
saying 0
the 0
teacher 0
did 0
tell 0
the 0
students 0
about 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
prayer 0
(my 0
daughter 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
1 0
other 0
said 0
this 0
is 0
false)[.] 0

He 0
is 0
using 0
my 0
arguments 0
I 0
made 0
to 0
him 0
yesterday 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
teacher. 0

The 0
teacher 0
today 0
told 0
the 0
students 0
the 0
assignment 0
was 0
optional. 0

My 0
daughter 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
other 0
students 0
were 0
under 0
the 0
impression 0
all 0
the 0
packet 0
assignments 0
were 0
mandatory 0
(the 0
Jewish 0
one 0
and 0
the 0
Christian 0
ones 0
were 0
mandatory). 0

I 0
wrote 0
to 0
Dr. 0

Branch 0
to 0
share 0
with 0
him 0
the 0
resource 0
that 0
Miss 0
Hinson 0
used 0
and 0
point 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
material 0
she 0
gave 0
the 0
students 0
did 0
not 0
include 0
all 0
the 0
faith 0
aspects 0
for 0
Christianity. 0

The 0
students 0
received 0
2 0
pages 0
for 0
Christianity 0
from 0
this 0
resource 0
while 0
all 0
the 0
Islamic 0
sections 0
were 0
left 0
intact. 0

Here’s 0
the 0
link 0
for 0
you 0
to 0
review. 0

You 0
will 0
notice 0
all 0
the 0
faith 0
elements 0
were 0
left 0
out 0
for 0
Judaism 0
and 0
Christianity 0
while 0
the 0
Islamic 0
section 0
was 0
left 0
the 0
way 0
it’s 0
presented. 0

https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf 0
So 0
she 0
decided 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
extra 0
resources 0
for 0
Islam 0
and 0
the 0
school 0
is 0
saying 0
that’s 0
not 0
indoctrination 0
or 0
proselytizing? 0

The 0
faith 0
aspects 0
and 0
the 0
same 0
considerations 0
were 0
not 0
given 0
to 0
the 0
others 0
as 0
they 0
were 0
for 0
Islam. 0

This 0
actually 0
further 0
proves 0
my 0
point 0
that 0
Islam 0
was 0
afforded 0
special 0
privilege 0
over 0
the 0
others. 0

The 0
school 0
is 0
backtracking 0
and 0
being 0
deceptive 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
weasel 0
out 0
of 0
this. 0

The 0
teacher 0
today 0
clarified 0
things 0
for 0
the 0
students 0
but 0
that 0
still 0
does 0
not 0
excuse 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
teaching 0
the 0
Islamic 0
faith 0
and 0
asking 0
the 0
kids 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
Sharia. 0

Look 0
at 0
the 0
Islamic 0
packet 0
again. 0

They 0
are 0
asking 0
the 0
kids 0
to 0
write 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
Surahs. 0

The 0
teacher 0
still 0
has 0
not 0
corrected 0
the 0
error 0
that 0
calligraphy 0
was 0
started 0
by 0
the 0
arabs. 0

They 0
are 0
doubling 0
down 0
and 0
only 0
after 0
being 0
called 0
on 0
it 0
are 0
they 0
trying 0
to 0
backtrack. 0

Rich 0
Penkoski 0
is 0
hardly 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
protest 0
this 0
egregious 1
submission 0
to 0
the 1
most 1
vicious 1
and 1
brutal 1
ideology 1
on 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
Earth. 1

In 0
Volusia 0
County, 0
Florida, 0
hundreds 0
protested 0
Islamic 0
lessons 0
in 0
their 0
“World 0
History” 0
text, 0
a 0
Common 0
Core-approved 0
high 0
school 0
history 0
textbook. 0

With 0
an 0
entire 0
chapter 0
dedicated 0
to 0
the 0
virtues 0
of 0
Islam 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
single 0
chapter 0
for 0
Christianity, 0
the 0
textbook 0
had 0
Floridians 0
in 0
a 0
frenzy. 1

And 0
who 0
is 0
the 0
biggest 0
pusher 0
of 0
Common 0
Core 0
besides 0
leftist 0
progressives? 0

The 0
Islamic 0
Society 0
of 0
North 0
America, 0
a 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
front 0
group, 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
Hamas-tied 0
Council 0
on 0
American-Islamic 0
Relations 0
(CAIR). 0

In 0
Florida, 0
CAIR 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
offensive 0
(more 0
here). 0

We 0
have 0
seen 0
the 0
increasing 0
Islamization 1
of 0
the 0
public-school 0
curriculum. 0

History 0
lessons 0
in 0
Islam 0
are 0
dawah 0
– 0
proselytizing 0
for 0
Islam. 0

Large 0
public-school 0
publishers 0
have 0
been 0
bought 0
by 0
the 0
Saudis. 0

In 0
West 0
Virginia, 0
it 0
gets 0
even 0
worse. 0

Rich 0
Penkoski 0
has 0
alerted 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
latest 0
development 0
in 0
the 0
forced 1
Islamization 1
of 0
his 0
children’s 0
school 0
curriculum: 0
after 0
the 0
Daily 0
Caller 0
and 0
Geller 0
Report 0
exposed 0
what 0
was 0
happening, 0
Mountain 0
Ridge 0
administrators 0
and 0
teachers 0
began 0
messaging 0
parents 0
who 0
were 0
sharing 0
the 0
story, 0
asking 0
them 0
to 0
remove 0
their 0
posts. 0

What 0
do 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
hide? 0

Apparently, 0
a 0
great 0
deal. 0

Worse 0
still, 0
Penkoski 0
is 0
now 0
being 0
threatened 1
by 0
students 0
who 0
attend 0
the 0
school 0
with 0
his 0
daughter. 0

(And 0
who 0
is 0
behind 0
them? 0

Unidentified 0
“adult 0
friends.”) 0

He 0
sent 0
this 0
message 0
to 0
me: 0

A 0
student 0
in 0
the 0
school 0
threatened 1
to 0
get 0
her 0
adult 0
friends 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
my 0
home 0
and 0
kill 1
me 0
by 0
stabbing 0
me 0
in 0
the 0
chest 0
and 0
ripping 1
my 1
organs 1
out. 1

They 0
told 0
my 0
daughter 0
“we 0
are 0
gonna 0
get 0
some 0
people 0
and 0
kill 1
your 0
dad.” 0
This 0
student, 0
who 0
is 0
known 0
to 0
me 0
but 0
whom 0
I 0
cannot 0
name 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
a 0
minor, 0
has 0
given 0
students 0
our 0
address 0
and 0
is 0
encouraging 0
them 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
my 0
home 0
over 0
this 0
whole 0
thing. 0

Another 0
student 0
told 0
my 0
daughter 0
that 0
she 0
and 0
the 0
first 0
student 0
and 0
her 0
adult 0
friends 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
kill 1
me 0
and 0
carve 0
a 0
satanic 1
star 0
in 0
my 0
chest 0
and 0
rip 1
out 1
my 1
organs. 1

They 0
then 0
threatened 1
to 0
hang 1
my 1
3-year-old 1
and 1
1-year-old 1
and 1
kidnap 1
my 1
14-year-old. 1

All 0
this 0
in 0
school 0
today 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
articles. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
joke 0
and 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
investigated. 0

I 0
have 0
contacted 0
the 0
school’s 0
principal, 0
Dr. 0

Branch, 0
and 0
I 0
trust 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
take 0
this 0
matter 0
seriously 0
and 0
deal 0
with 0
it 0
appropriately. 0

Is 1
the 1
principal 1
acting 1
on 1
this? 1

And 1
do 1
the 1
police 1
have 1
any 1
interest 1
in 1
this? 1

Or 1
would 1
that 1
be 1
“islamofauxbic”? 1

fear 0
an 0

in 0
Ebola 0
cases 0
after 0
an 0
outbreak 0
in 0
Congo 0
entered 0
a 0
“new 0
phase” 0
and 0
spread 0
from 0
the 0
countryside 0
to 0
a 0
city. 0

The 0
BBC 0
reports 0
that 0
Health 0
Minister 0
Oly 0
Ilunga 0
Kalenga 0
confirmed 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
Mbandaka, 0
a 0
city 0
of 0
a 0
million 0
people 0
about 0
130km 0
(80 0
miles) 0
from 0
the 0
area 0
where 0
the 0
first 0
cases 0
were 0
confirmed 0
earlier 0
this 0
month. 0

The 0
city 0
is 0
a 0
major 0
transportation 0
hub 0
with 0
routes 0
to 0
the 0
capital 0
Kinshasa. 0

Forty-four 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
infected 0
and 0
23 0
people 0
are 0
known 0
to 0
have 0
died. 0

Senior 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
(WHO) 0
official 0
Peter 0
Salama 0
said 0
the 0
spread 0
to 0
Mbandaka 0
meant 0
there 0
was 0
the 0
potential 0
for 0
an 0
“explosive 1
increase” 1
in 0
cases. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
major 0
development 0
in 0
the 0
outbreak,” 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
BBC. 0

“We 0
have 0
urban 0
Ebola, 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
different 0
animal 0
from 0
rural 0
Ebola. 0

The 1
potential 1
for 1
an 1
explosive 1
increase 1
in 1
cases 1
is 0
now 0
there.” 0
Mr 0
Salama, 0
the 0
WHO’s 0
deputy 0
director-general 0
for 0
emergency 0
preparedness 0
and 0
response, 0
said 0
Mbandaka’s 0
location 0
on 0
the 0
Congo 0
river, 0
widely 0
used 0
for 0
transportation, 0
raised 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
Ebola 0
spreading 0
to 0
surrounding 0
countries 0
such 0
as 0
Congo-Brazzaville 0
and 0
the 0
Central 0
African 0
Republic 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
downstream 0
to 0
Kinshasa, 0
a 0
city 0
of 0
10 0
million 0
people. 0

“This 0
puts 0
a 0
whole 0
different 0
lens 0
on 0
this 0
outbreak 0
and 0
gives 0
us 0
increased 0
urgency 0
to 0
move 0
very 0
quickly 0
into 0
Mbandaka 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
new 0
first 0
sign 0
of 0
transmission,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
BBC 0
adds 0
that 0
the 0
WHO 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
recommending 0
any 0
trade 0
or 0
travel 0
restrictions 0
either 0
within 0
DR 0
Congo, 0
for 0
example 0
between 0
Mbandaka 0
and 0
Kinshasa, 0
or 0
internationally. 0

But 0
Mr 0
Salama 0
said 0
that 0
13 0
countries 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
were 0
boosting 0
border 0
screening 0
measures 0
and 0
said 0
DR 0
Congo 0
itself 0
was 0
increasing 0
exit 0
screening 0
measures. 0

“The 0
good 0
news 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
DR 0
Congo 0
population 0
is 0
very 0
used 0
to 0
Ebola 0
outbreaks,” 0
he 0
added. 0

“They 0
know 0
to 0
protect 0
themselves 0
by 0
avoiding 0
mass 0
gatherings 0
and 0
mass 0
funerals. 0

They 0
know 0
as 0
well 0
that 0
traditional 0
healers 0
can 0
amplify 0
the 0
outbreak.” 0

As 0
The 0
Daily 0
Mail 0
notes, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
ninth 0
time 0
Ebola 0
has 0
been 0
recorded 0
in 0

since 0
the 0

its 0
first 0
known 0
appearance 0
near 0
its 0
northern 0
Ebola 0
river 0
in 0
the 0
1970s. 0

Ebola 0
is 0
most 0
feared 0
for 0
the 0
internal 0
and 0
external 0
bleeding 0
it 0
can 0
cause 0
in 0
victims 0
owing 0
to 0
damage 0
done 0
to 0

Common 0

a 0

claimed 0
in 0
the 0

that 0
Kemp, 0

failed 0
to 0
maintain 0
“the 0
security 0
of 0

leading 0
up 0

the 0

The 1
suit 1
blasted 1
the 1
state’s 1
“provisional 1

that 1
could 1
disenfranchise 1

The 0

ruled 0
that 0

to 0
Michael 0
Matt: 0
"Amoris 0
Not 0
An 0
Exercise 0
of 0
Magisterium" 0
(Now 0
what?) 0

Given 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has, 0
since 0
that 0
interview 0
took 0
place, 0
attempted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops’ 0
interpretation 0
of 0
AL 0
'magisterial'--an 0
interpretation 0
that 0
allows 0
public 0
adulterers 0
to 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion--Cardinal 0
Burke’s 0
reply 0
to 0
my 0
question 0
on 0
January 0
9th 0
of 0
this 0
year 0
would 0
seem 0
to 0
take 0
on 0
new 0
relevancy. 0

In 0
my 0
interview 0
of 0
Raymond 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
less 0
than 0
one 0
year 0
ago, 0
I 0
asked 0
His 0
Eminence 0
to 0
clarify 0
what, 0
exactly, 0
is 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
authoritative 0
weight 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
post-synodal 0
exhortation, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

Now, 0
Cardinal 0
Francesco 0
Coccopalmerio, 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council 0
for 0
Legislative 0
Texts, 0
made 0
it 0
very 0
clear 0
to 0
the 0
Catholic 0
News 0
Service 0
on 0
December 0
5 0
what 0
the 0
Pope 0
is 0
up 0
to: 0
“The 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
requested 0
that 0
his 0
letter 0
and 0
the 0
interpretations 0
of 0
the 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
bishops 0
be 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
AAS 0
means 0
that 0
His 0
Holiness 0
has 0
given 0
these 0
documents 0
a 0
particular 0
qualification 0
that 0
elevates 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
being 0
official 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
church. 0

While 0
the 0
content 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
letter 0
itself 0
does 0
not 0
contain 0
teachings 0
on 0
faith 0
and 0
morals, 0
it 0
does 0
point 0
toward 0
the 0
interpretations 0
of 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops 0
and 0
confirms 0
them 0
as 0
authentically 0
reflecting 0
his 0
own 0
mind. 0

Thus 0
together 0
the 0
two 0
documents 0
became 0
the 0
Holy 0
Father’s 0
authentic 0
magisterium 0
for 0
the 0
whole 0
church.” 0

What 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
rightly 0
describes 0
as 0
lacking 1
in 1
any 1
magisterial 1
weight 1
whatsoever—and, 1
in 0
fact, 0
in 0
dire 0
need 0
of 0
clarification 0
and 0
correction— 0
has 0
by 0
papal 0
fiat 0
been 0
declared 0
magisterial, 0
and 0
thus 0
binding 0
on 0
us 0
all. 0

Francis 1
made 1
it 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
Argentine 1
bishops’ 1
interpretation 1
of 1
AL 1
allowing 1
public 1
adulterers 1
to 1
receive 1
Holy 1
Communion 1
“explains 1
precisely 1
the 1
meaning 1
of 1
Chapter 1
VIII 1
of 1
‘Amoris 1
Laetitia.’ 1
There 1
are 1
no 1
other 1
interpretations.” 1

I 0
would 0
imagine 0
this 0
outrageous 1
overreach 1
of 1
papal 1
authority 1
on 0
the 0
Pope's 0
part 0
would 0
make 0
it 0
ominously 1
clear 1
to 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
that 0
the 0
time 0
has 0
come 0
to 0
issue 0
his 0
public 0
correction 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis's 0
erroneous 0
teaching. 0

The 0
moment, 0
it 0
would 0
seem, 0
has 0
come. 0

Cardinal 0
Burke, 0
please 0
and 0
in 0
God's 1
Holy 1
Name, 1
we 1
beg 1
you 1
to 1
act 1
now 1
-- 1
before 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
succeeds 1
in 1
tearing 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
half 1
completely. 1

We 0
fear 0
that 0
your 0
silence 0
now, 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
this 1
latest 1
papal 1
travesty, 1
may 0
suggest 0
consent 0
to 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
is 0
magisterial, 0
and 0
thus 0
prove 0
more 0
damaging 0
than 0
if 0
you 0
had 0
never 0
raised 0
your 0
voice 0
at 0
all. 0

We 0
thank 0
God 0
for 0
the 0
courage 0
you've 0
shown 0
in 0
defending 0
His 0
Church 0
thus 0
far, 0
and 0
we 0
pray 0
he 0
will 0
continue 0

and 0

you 0
as 0
you 0
do 0
what 0
must 0

campaign. 0

Omar 1
Smith, 1
who 1
says 1
he 1
went 1
to 1
college 1
with 1
Gillum, 1
reveals 1
Gillum 1
cannot 1
fulfill 1
his 1
campaign 1
promises 1
even 1
if 1
he 1
wanted 1
to. 1

When 1
asked 1
how 1
Gillum 1
would 1
fund 1
all 1
the 1
programs 1
he 1
says 1
he 1
wants 1
to 1
fund, 1
Smith 1
says 1
Gillum 1
“can’t,” 1
and 0
when 0
asked 0
if 0
voters 0
are 0
aware 0
that 0
Gillum 0
cannot 0
deliver 0
on 0
his 0
proposed 0
programs, 0
Smith 0
says: 0

SMITH: 0
“That’s 0
not 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
know… 0
That’s 0
not 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
know. 0

Remember 0
our 0
saying, 0
modern 0
day 0
fairy 0
tales 0
start 0
with 0
‘once 0
I 0
am 0
elected. 0

'” 0

Smith 1
explains 1
that 1
most 1
of 1
Gillum’s 1
campaign 1
promises 1
could 1
never 1
be 1
implemented, 1
and 0
that 0
the 0
Gillum 0
campaign 0
knows 0
this: 0

SMITH: 0
“So, 1
let’s 1
go 1
back 1
to 1
Mr. 1
Gillum’s 1
platform, 1
right? 1

Raise 1
the 1
corporate 1
tax 1
in 1
Florida 1
from 1
7 1
to 1
11 1
percent. 1

That 1
will 1
never 1
happen. 1

Raise 1
teacher’s 1
pay 1
to 1
$50,000, 1
that 1
will 1
never 1
happen. 1

Give 1
me 1
another 1
position. 1

Medicare 1
for 1
all, 1
that 1
will 1
never 1
happen. 1

The 0
reason 0
being, 0
the 0
legislature 0
that 0
write 0
the 0
bills 0
is 0
all 0
Republican 0
controlled. 0

Democratic 0
governor, 0
Republican 0
legislature. 0

So, 0
unless 0
the 0
legislature 0
writes 0
a 0
bill, 0
and 0
it 0
got 0
voted 0
on 0
the 0
floor, 0
it 0
cannot 0
pass.” 0

Smith 0
says 0
that 0
“the 0
rules 0
in 0
Florida 0
are 1
f***ed 1
up” 1
and 0
that 0
Florida 0
is 0
a 1
“cracker 1
state,” 1
explaining 0
that 0
the 0
Florida 0
legislature 0
has 0
to 0
become 0
racially 0
black 0
for 0
Gillum’s 0
agenda 0
to 0
advance. 0

“Whip 1
up” 1
the 1
poor 1
into 1
a 1
“frenzy 1
in 1
order 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
vote.” 1

Smith 0
says 0
that 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
get 0
voters 0
on 0
board 0
with 0
Gillum’s 1
fairy 1
tale 1
platform, 1
the 0
campaign 0
must 0
“whip” 1
lower 1
income 1
individuals 1
“into 1
a 1
frenzy.” 1

SMITH: 0
“You 1
whip 1
’em 1
up. 1

The 1
poor, 1
the 1
middle 1
income. 1

You 1
have 1
to 1
whip 1
them 1
up 1
into 1
a 1
frenzy 1
in 1
order 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
vote. 1

Once 0
Gillum 0
is 0
in, 0
in 0
another 0
2 0
years, 0
other 0
Republican 0
Senators 0
and 0
Legislators 0
will 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
ballot. 0

So, 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
whip 1
up 1
the 0
Andrew 0
Gillum 0
voters 0
again 0
in 0
those 0
counties 0
to 0
vote 0
out 0
the 0
Republican 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
Democratic 0
Legislature 0
in 0
order 0
for 0
his 0
(Gillum) 0
will 0
to 0
be 0
executed.” 0

Smith 0
adds 0
that 0
because 0
not 0
all 0
Democratic 0
voters 0
are 0
the 0
same, 0
that 0
the 0
Gillum 0
campaign 0
needs 1
to 1
appeal 1
to 1
“white 1
guilt” 1
to 0
turn 0
out 0
the 0
vote: 0

SMITH: 0
“You 1
have 1
to 1
appeal 1
to 1
white 1
guilt… 1
[be]cause 1
that’s 1
what 1
it 1
is.” 1

Smith 0
also 0
explains 0
that 0
the 0
Gillum 0
campaign 0
can’t 0
let 0
voters 0
know 0
what 0
Gillum’s 0
true 0
agenda 0
is 0
before 0
election 0
day: 0

SMITH: 0
“… 0
We 1
don’t, 1
do 1
we 1
have 1
to 1
let 1
[the 1
voters] 1
know 1
what 1
the 1
agenda 1
is 1
ahead 1
of 1
time? 1

We 1
can’t… 1
We 1
cannot… 1
You 1
alienate 1
everybody. 1

Then 0
you 0
get 0
painted 0
like, 0
oh, 0
Gillum 0
is 0
being 0
painted, 0
no. 0

You 0
are 0
a 0
socialist, 0
you 1
are 1
way 1
out 1
of 1
left 1
field…” 1

Gillum 0
is 0
a 1
“crazy, 1
crazy,” 1
Democrat 1

Smith 0
also 0
explains 0
Gillum’s 0
political 0
worldview, 0
saying 0
that 0
“Gillum 0
is 0
a 1
progressive… 1
He 0
is 0
a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
crazy 1
crazy 1
crazies.” 1

Cliff 0
Eserman, 0
who 0
works 0
for 0
the 0
Broward 0
County 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
adds 0
that 0
during 0
the 0
Democratic 0
primary, 0
Gillum 1
had 1
to 1
campaign 1
on 1
values 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
really 1
believe: 1

ESERMAN: 0
“In 0
order 0
to 0
win 0
he 0
had 0
to 0
be… 0
He’s 0
really 0
left 1
of 1
center. 1

So 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
left, 1
not 1
left 1
of 1
center… 1
For 0
the 0
primary. 0

Now 0
[in 0
the 0
general] 0
he’s 0
going 0
back 0
to 0
left 1
of 1
center.” 1

Dale 0
Holeness, 0

is 0
the 0
Broward 0
County 0
Commissioner 0
and 0
also 0
works 0
on 0
Gillum’s 0
campaign, 0
explains 0
Gillum’s 0
gun 0
control 0
views: 0

HOLENESS: 0
“There 0
ought 0
to 0
be 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
three-day 0
waiting 0
period 0
for 0
everybody 0
and 0
a 0
full 0
background 0
check 0
for 0
everybody… 0
And 0
we 0
need 0
to- 0
And 0
these 0
automatic 0
guns 0
with 0
sixteen 0
rounds 0
a 0
minute, 0
they 0
ought 0
to 0
not 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
streets 0
either, 0
so 0
that’s 0
his 0
plan.” 0

Adrian 0
Young, 0

Democratic 0
Party 0
also 0
elaborates 0
on 0
Gillum’s 0
gun 0
control 0
views 0
in 0
the 0
report: 0

YOUNG: 0
“… 0
I 0
do 0
think 0
he’s 0
not 0
saying 0
specifically 0
like 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
ban 0
bump 0
stocks 0
or 0
I’m 0
against 0
ATs, 0
only 0
because 0
he’s 0
running 0
a 0
race 0
right 0
now. 0

I 0
do 0
think 0
he 0
would 0
support 0
anybody 0
doing 0
that 0
stuff, 0
Bill 0
Nelson… 0
But 1
I 1
don’t 1
think 1
he 1
can 1
say 1
it 1
just 1
[be]cause 1
he’s 1
trying 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
moderates 1

the 1

people 1
in 1

Editor’s 0
Note: 0
Over 0
the 0
years, 0
Bishop 0
Robert 0
Morlino 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison 0
has 0
confirmed 0
several 0
of 0
my 0
children 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
traditional 0
Rite 0
of 0
Confirmation, 0
as 0
his 0
diocese 0
has 0
been 0
a 1
port 1
in 1
the 1
storm 1
for 0
many 0
displaced 0
and 0
disillusioned 0
Catholic 0
families. 0

We 0
don’t 0
see 0
eye-to-eye 0
on 0
everything, 0
of 0
course, 0
but 0
his 0
faith 0
and 0
pastoral 0
solicitude 0
have 0
for 0
us 0
been 0
a 0
light 1
in 1
the 1
darkness 1
and 0
proof 0
that 0
God 0
has 0
not 0
left 0
us 0
orphans. 0

And 0
now 0
this, 0
finally, 0
a 1
bishop 1
with 1
the 1
courage 1
to 1
look 1
the 1
beast 1
in 1
the 1
eye 1
and 1
speak 1
its 1
name 1
out 1
loud. 1

Bishop 0
Morlino 0
does 0
this 0
in 0
a 0
moment 0
when 0
he 0
is 0
under 0
heavy 0
attack 0
as 0
a 1
“hater” 1
for 0
defending 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
on 0
marriage—an 0
attack, 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
which 0
prompted 0
us 0
here 0
at 0
The 0
Remnant 0
to 0
join 0
the 0
fight 0
to 0
DEFEND 1
BISHOP 1
MORLINO 1
last 0
year. 0

"If 0
you'll 0
permit 0
me, 0
what 0
the 1
Church 1
needs 1
now 1
is 1
more 1
hatred! 1

As 0
I 0
have 0
said 0
previously, 0
St. 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas 0
said 0
that 0
hatred 0
of 0
wickedness 0
actually 0
belongs 0
to 0
the 0
virtue 0
of 0
charity. 0

As 0
the 0
Book 0
of 0
Proverbs 0
says 0
'My 0
mouth 0
shall 0
meditate 0
truth, 0
and 0
my 0
lips 0
shall 0
hate 0
wickedness 0
(Prov. 0

8:7).' 0

It 1
is 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
hate 1
sin 1
and 1
to 1
call 1
others 1
to 1
turn 1
away 1
from 1
sin. 1

– 0
Bishop 0
Robert 0
Morlino 0

This 0
is 0
what 0
a 1
courageous 1
shepherd 1
looks 0
like! 0

In 1
our 1
opinion, 1
during 1
the 1
most 1
vile 1
clergy 1
sex 1
scandal 1
in 1
history, 1
every 1
bishop 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
must 1
do 1
exactly 1
what 1
Bishop 1
Morlino 1
has 1
done, 1
i.e., 1
issue 1
a 1
statement 1
of 1
fidelity 1
to 1
the 1
Church’s 1
moral 1
theology, 1
specifically 1
her 1
teaching 1
against 1
the 1
mortal 1
sin 1
of 1
homosexual 1
acts. 1

In 0
so 0
doing, 0
the 0
bishops 0
will 0
incur 0
the 1
wrath 1
of 1
the 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
yes. 0

They 1
will 1
be 1
crucified 1
in 1
the 1
media, 1
yes. 1

But 1
they 1
will 1
also 1
be 1
doing 1
their 1
sacred 1
duty 1
before 1
God 1
in 1
reassuring 1
their 1
thoroughly 1
scandalized 1
flocks 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
absolutely 1
committed 1
to 1
the 1
defense 1
and 1
enforcement 1
of 1
the 1
Church’s 1
moral 1
teaching 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
under 1
scurrilous 1
attack 1
from 1
within. 1

Nothing 1
less 1
will 1
do. 1

Bishop 0
Morlino 0
has 0
now 0
done 0
it, 0
and 0
we 1
respectfully 1
demand 1
that 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
bishops 1
either 1
follow 1
suit 1
or 1
face 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
being 1
complicit 1
with 1
the 1
degenerate 1
and 1
even 1
criminal 1
shepherds, 1
accounts 1
of 1
whose 1
betrayal 1
and 1
vice 1
now 1
dominate 1
the 1
news. 1

May 1
God 1
bless 1
and 1
keep 1
Bishop 1
Robert 1
Morlino. 1

to 0

the 0

crisis 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0

August 0

2018 0

Dear 0
brothers 0
and 0
sisters 0
in 0
Christ 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison, 0

The 0
past 0
weeks 0
have 0
brought 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
scandal, 0
justified 0
anger, 0
and 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
answers 0
and 0
action 0
by 0
many 0
faithful 0
Catholics 0
here 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
overseas, 0
directed 0
at 0
the 0
Church 0
hierarchy 0
regarding 0
sexual 0
sins 0
by 0
bishops, 0
priests, 0
and 0
even 0
cardinals. 0

Still 0
more 0
anger 0
is 0
rightly 0
directed 0
at 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
complicit 0
in 0
keeping 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
serious 0
sins 0
from 0
coming 0
to 0
light. 0

For 0
my 0
part 0
— 0
and 0
I 0
know 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
alone 0
— 0
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 1
this. 1

I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
people 0
being 0
hurt, 0
gravely 1
hurt! 1

I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
the 0
obfuscation 0
of 0
truth. 0

I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
sin. 0

And, 0
as 0
one 0
who 0
has 0
tried 0
— 0
despite 0
my 0
many 0
imperfections 0
— 0
to 0
lay 0
down 0
my 0
life 0
for 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Church, 0
I 1
am 1
tired 1
of 0
the 0
regular 0
violation 0
of 0
sacred 0
duties 0
by 0
those 1
entrusted 1
with 1
immense 1
responsibility 1
from 1
the 1
Lord 1
for 1
the 1
care 1
of 1
His 1
people. 1

The 0
stories 0
being 0
brought 0
into 0
light 0
and 0
displayed 0
in 0
gruesome 1
detail 1
with 0
regard 0
to 0
some 0
priests, 0
religious, 0
and 0
now 0
even 0
those 0
in 0
places 0
of 0
highest 0
leadership, 0
are 0
sickening. 1

Hearing 0
even 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
stories 0
is, 0
quite 1
literally, 1
enough 1
to 1
make 1
someone 1
sick. 1

But 0
my 0
own 0
sickness 1
at 0
the 0
stories 0
is 0
quickly 0
put 0
into 0
perspective 0
when 0
I 0
recall 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
many 0
individuals 0
have 0
lived 0
through 0
them 0
for 0
years. 0

For 0
them, 0
these 0
are 0
not 0
stories, 0
they 0
are 0
indeed 0
realities. 0

To 0
them 0
I 0
turn 0
and 0
say, 0
again, 0
I 0
am 0
sorry 0
for 0
what 0
you 0
have 0
suffered 0
and 0
what 0
you 0
continue 0
to 0
suffer 0
in 0
your 0
mind 0
and 0
in 0
your 0
heart. 0

If 0
you 0
have 0
not 0
already 0
done 0
so, 0
I 0
beg 0
you 0
to 0
reach 0
out, 0
as 0
hard 0
as 0
that 0
may 0
be, 0
and 0
seek 0
help 0
to 0
begin 0
to 0
heal. 0

Also, 0
if 0
you’ve 0
been 0
hurt 0
by 0
a 0
priest 0
of 0
our 0
diocese, 0
I 0
encourage 0
you 0
to 0
come 0
forward, 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
report 0
to 0
law 0
enforcement 0
and 0
to 0
our 0
Victim’s 0
Assistance 0
Coordinator, 0
so 0
that 0
we 0
might 0
begin, 0
with 0
you 0
as 0
an 0
individual, 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
set 0
things 0
right 0
to 0
the 0
greatest 0
extent 0
possible. 0

There 0
is 0
nothing 0
about 0
these 0
stories 0
that 0
is 0
okay. 0

These 1
actions, 1
committed 1
by 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
few, 1
can 1
only 1
be 1
classified 1
as 1
evil, 1
evil 1
that 1
cries 1
out 1
for 1
justice 1
and 1
sin 1
that 1
must 1
be 1
cast 1
out 1
from 1
our 1
Church. 1

Faced 0
with 0
stories 0
of 0
the 0
depravity 0
of 0
sinners 0
within 0
the 0
Church, 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
tempted 0
to 0
despair. 0

And 0
why? 0

The 0
reality 0
of 0
sin 0
— 0
even 0
sin 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
— 0
is 0
nothing 0
new. 0

We 0
are 0
a 0
Church 0
made 0
of 0
sinners, 0
but 0
we 0
are 0
sinners 0
called 0
to 0
sanctity. 0

So 0
what 0
is 0
new? 0

What 0
is 0
new 0
is 0
the 0
seeming 0
acceptance 0
of 0
sin 0
by 0
some 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
the 0
apparent 0
efforts 0
to 0
cover 0
over 0
sin 0
by 0
them 0
and 0
others. 0

Unless 1
and 1
until 1
we 1
take 1
seriously 1
our 1
call 1
to 1
sanctity, 1
we, 1
as 1
an 1
institution 1
and 1
as 1
individuals, 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
suffer 1
the 1
“wages 1
of 1
sin.” 1

For 0
too 0
long 0
we 0
have 0
diminished 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
sin 0
— 0
we 0
have 0
refused 0
to 0
call 0
a 0
sin 0
a 0
sin 1
— 0
and 0
we 1
have 1
excused 1
sin 1
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
a 1
mistaken 1
notion 1
of 1
mercy. 1

In 0
our 0
efforts 0
to 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
world 0
we 0
have 0
become 0
all 0
too 0
willing 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Way, 0
the 0
Truth, 0
and 0
the 0
Life. 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
causing 0
offense 0
we 0
offer 0
to 0
ourselves 0
and 0
to 0
others 0
niceties 0
and 0
human 0
consolation. 0

Why 1
do 1
we 1
do 1
this? 1

Is 1
it 1
out 1
of 1
an 1
earnest 1
desire 1
to 1
display 1
a 1
misguided 1
sense 1
of 1
being 1
“pastoral?” 1
Have 1
we 1
covered 1
over 1
the 1
truth 1
out 1
of 1
fear? 1

Are 1
we 1
afraid 1
of 1
being 1
disliked 1
by 1
people 1
in 1
this 1
world? 1

Or 1
are 1
we 1
afraid 1
of 1
being 1
called 1
hypocrites 1
because 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
striving 1
tirelessly 1
for 1
holiness 1
in 1
our 1
own 1
lives? 1

Perhaps 0
these 0
are 0
the 0
reasons, 0
but 0
perhaps 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
complex 0
than 0
this. 0

In 1
the 1
end, 1
the 1
excuses 1
do 1
not 1
matter. 1

We 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
with 1
sin. 1

It 1
must 1
be 1
rooted 1
out 1
and 1
again 1
considered 1
unacceptable. 1

Love 0
sinners? 0

Yes. 0

Accept 0
true 0
repentance? 0

Yes. 0

But 0
do 0
not 0
say 0
sin 0
is 0
okay. 0

And 0
do 0
not 0
pretend 0
that 0
grave 0
violations 0
of 0
office 0
and 0
of 0
trust 0
come 0
without 0
grave, 0
lasting 0
consequences. 0

For 0
the 0
Church, 0
the 0
crisis 0
we 0
face 0
is 0
not 0
limited 0
to 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
affair, 0
or 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
Grand 0
Jury 0
Report, 0
or 0
anything 0
else 0
that 0
may 0
come. 0

The 0
deeper 0
crisis 0
that 0
must 0
be 0
addressed 0
is 0
the 1
license 1
for 1
sin 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
home 1
in 1
individuals 1
at 1
every 1
level 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

There 0
is 0
a 0
certain 0
comfort 0
level 0
with 0
sin 0
that 0
has 0
come 0
to 0
pervade 0
our 0
teaching, 0
our 0
preaching, 0
our 0
decision 0
making, 0
and 0
our 0
very 0
way 0
of 0
living. 0

If 0
you’ll 0
permit 0
me, 0
what 1
the 1
Church 1
needs 1
now 1
is 1
more 1
hatred! 1

As 0
I 0
have 0
said 0
previously, 0
St. 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas 0
said 0
that 0
hatred 0
of 0
wickedness 0
actually 0
belongs 0
to 0
the 0
virtue 0
of 0
charity. 0

As 0
the 0
Book 0
of 0
Proverbs 0
says 0
“My 0
mouth 0
shall 0
meditate 0
truth, 0
and 0
my 0
lips 0
shall 0
hate 0
wickedness 0
(Prov. 0

8:7).” 0
It 1
is 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
love 1
to 1
hate 1
sin 1
and 1
to 1
call 1
others 1
to 1
turn 1
away 1
from 1
sin. 1

There 0
must 0
be 0
no 0
room 0
left, 0
no 0
refuge 0
for 0
sin 0
— 0
either 0
within 0
our 0
own 0
lives, 0
or 0
within 0
the 0
lives 0
of 0
our 0
communities. 0

To 0
be 0
a 0
refuge 0
for 0
sinners 0
(which 0
we 0
should 0
be), 0
the 0
Church 0
must 0
be 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
sinners 0
can 0
turn 0
to 0
be 0
reconciled. 0

In 0
this 0
I 0
speak 0
of 0
all 0
sin. 0

But 0
to 0
be 0
clear, 0
in 0
the 0
specific 0
situations 0
at 0
hand, 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
deviant 1
sexual 1
— 0
almost 0
exclusively 0
homosexual 0
— 0
acts 0
by 0
clerics. 0

We’re 0
also 0
talking 0
about 0
homosexual 0
propositions 0
and 0
abuses 0
against 0
seminarians 0
and 0
young 0
priests 0
by 0
powerful 1
priests, 1
bishops, 1
and 1
cardinals. 1

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
acts 0
and 0
actions 0
which 0
are 0
not 0
only 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
sacred 0
promises 0
made 0
by 0
some, 0
in 0
short, 0
sacrilege, 0
but 1
also 1
are 1
in 1
violation 1
of 1
the 1
natural 1
moral 1
law 1
for 1
all. 1

To 0
call 0
it 0
anything 0
else 0
would 0
be 0
deceitful 0
and 0
would 0
only 0
ignore 0
the 0
problem 0
further. 0

There 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
effort 0
to 0
keep 0
separate 0
acts 0
which 0
fall 0
under 0
the 0
category 0
of 0
now-culturally-acceptable 1
acts 1
of 1
homosexuality 1
from 0
the 0
publically-deplorable 1
acts 1
of 1
pedophilia. 1

That 0
is 0
to 0
say, 0
until 0
recently 0
the 0
problems 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
have 0
been 0
painted 0
purely 0
as 0
problems 0
of 0
pedophilia 0
— 0
this 0
despite 0
clear 0
evidence 0
to 0
the 0
contrary. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
be 0
honest 0
that 0
the 0
problems 0
are 0
both 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
more. 0

To 0
fall 0
into 0
the 0
trap 0
of 0
parsing 0
problems 0
according 0
to 0
what 0
society 0
might 0
find 0
acceptable 0
or 0
unacceptable 0
is 0
ignoring 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
never 0
held 0
ANY 0
of 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
acceptable 0
— 0
neither 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
children, 0
nor 0
any 0
use 0
of 0
one’s 0
sexuality 0
outside 0
of 0
the 0
marital 0
relationship, 0
nor 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
sodomy, 0
nor 0
the 0
entering 0
of 0
clerics 0
into 0
intimate 0
sexual 0
relationships 0
at 0
all, 0
nor 0
the 0
abuse 0
and 0
coercion 0
by 0
those 0
with 0
authority. 0

In 0
this 0
last 0
regard, 0
special 0
mention 0
should 0
be 0
made 0
of 0
the 1
most 1
notorious 1
and 1
highest 1
in 1
ranking 1
case, 1
that 0
being 0
the 0
allegations 0
of 0
former-Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick’s 0
(oft-rumored, 0
now 0
very 0
public) 0
sexual 0
sins, 0
predation, 0
and 0
abuse 0
of 0
power. 0

The 0
well-documented 0
details 0
of 0
this 0
case 0
are 0
disgraceful 1
and 0
seriously 1
scandalous, 1
as 0
is 0
any 0
covering 0
up 0
of 0
such 0
appalling 1
actions 1
by 0
other 0
Church 0
leaders 0
who 0
knew 0
about 0
it 0
based 0
on 0
solid 0
evidence. 0

While 0
recent 0
credible 0
accusations 0
of 0
child 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick 0
have 0
brought 0
a 1
whole 1
slew 1
of 1
issues 1
to 0
light, 0
long-ignored 0
was 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
abuse 0
of 0
his 0
power 0
for 0
the 0
sake 0
of 0
homosexual 0
gratification. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
homosexual 0
subculture 0
within 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
that 0
is 0
wreaking 1
great 1
devastation 1
in 1
the 1
vineyard 1
of 1
the 1
Lord. 1

The 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
homosexual 0
inclination 0
is 0
not 0
in 0
itself 0
sinful, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
intrinsically 0
disordered 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
renders 0
any 0
man 0
stably 0
afflicted 0
by 0
it 0
unfit 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
priest. 0

And 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
act 0
upon 0
this 0
disordered 0
inclination 0
is 0
a 1
sin 1
so 1
grave 1
that 1
it 1
cries 1
out 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
vengeance, 1
especially 0
when 0
it 0
involves 0
preying 0
upon 0
the 0
young 0
or 0
the 0
vulnerable. 0

Such 0
wickedness 1
should 0
be 0
hated 1
with 1
a 1
perfect 1
hatred. 1

Christian 0
charity 0
itself 0
demands 0
that 0
we 0
should 0
hate 0
wickedness 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
love 0
goodness. 0

But 0
while 0
hating 0
the 0
sin, 0
we 0
must 0
never 0
hate 0
the 0
sinner, 0
who 0
is 0
called 0
to 0
conversion, 0
penance, 0
and 0
renewed 0
communion 0
with 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Church, 0
through 0
His 0
inexhaustible 0
mercy. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
however, 0
the 0
love 0
and 0
mercy 0
which 0
we 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
have 0
even 0
for 0
the 0
worst 0
of 0
sinners 0
does 0
not 0
exclude 0
holding 0
them 0
accountable 0
for 0
their 0
actions 0
through 0
a 0
punishment 0
proportionate 0
to 0
the 0
gravity 0
of 0
their 0
offense. 0

In 0
fact, 0
a 0
just 0
punishment 0
is 0
an 0
important 0
work 0
of 0
love 0
and 0
mercy, 0
because, 0
while 0
it 0
serves 0
primarily 0
as 0
retribution 0
for 0
the 0
offense 0
committed, 0
it 1
also 1
offers 1
the 1
guilty 1
party 1
an 1
opportunity 1
to 1
make 1
expiation 1
for 1
his 1
sin 1
in 1
this 1
life 1
(if 1
he 1
willingly 1
accepts 1
his 1
punishment), 1
thus 1
sparing 1
him 1
worse 1
punishment 1
in 1
the 1
life 1
to 1
come. 1

Motivated, 0
therefore, 0
by 0
love 0
and 0
concern 0
for 0
souls, 0
I 0
stand 0
with 0
those 0
calling 0
for 0
justice 0
to 0
be 0
done 0
upon 0
the 0
guilty. 0

The 0
sins 0
and 0
crimes 0
of 0
McCarrick, 0
and 0
of 0
far 0
too 0
many 0
others 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
bring 0
suspicion 0
and 0
mistrust 0
upon 0
many 1
good 1
and 1
virtuous 1
priests, 1
bishops, 1
and 1
cardinals, 1
and 0
suspicion 0
and 0
mistrust 0
upon 0
many 1
great 1
and 1
respectable 1
seminaries 1
and 0
so 1
many 1
holy 1
and 1
faithful 1
seminarians. 1

The 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
instance 0
of 0
mistrust 0
harms 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
very 0
good 0
work 0
we 0
do 0
in 0
Christ’s 0
name. 0

It 0
causes 0
others 0
to 0
sin 0
in 0
their 0
thoughts, 0
words, 0
and 0
deeds 0
— 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
scandal. 0

And 0
the 0
second 0
mistrust 0
harms 0
the 0
future 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
since 0
our 0
future 0
priests 0
are 0
at 0
stake. 0

I 0
said 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
tempted 0
to 0
despair 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

However, 0
that 0
temptation 0
quickly 0
passed, 0
thanks 0
be 0
to 0
God. 0

No 0
matter 0
how 0
large 0
the 0
problem, 0
we 0
know 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
go 0
forward 0
in 0
faith, 0
to 0
rely 0
upon 0
God’s 0
promises 0
to 0
us, 0
and 0
to 0
work 0
hard 0
to 0
make 0
every 0
bit 0
of 0
difference 0
we 0
can, 0
within 0
our 0
spheres 0
of 0
influence. 0

I 0
have 0
recently 0
had 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
talk 0
directly 0
with 0
our 0
seminarians 0
about 0
these 0
very 0
pressing 0
matters, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
begun 0
to, 0
and 0
will 0
continue 0
to, 0
talk 0
with 0
the 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
diocese, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
faithful, 0
in 0
person 0
and 0
through 0
my 0
weekly 0
column 0
and 0
homilies, 0
making 0
things 0
as 0
clear 0
as 0
I 0
can, 0
from 0
my 0
perspective. 0

Here 0
now, 0
I 0
offer 0
a 0
few 0
thoughts 0
to 0
those 0
of 0
my 0
diocese: 0

In 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
we 0
must 0
continue 0
to 0
build 0
upon 0
the 0
good 0
work 0
which 0
we 0
have 0
accomplished 0
in 0
protecting 0
the 0
youth 0
and 0
vulnerable 0
of 0
our 0
diocese. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
work 0
on 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
never 0
rest 0
in 0
our 0
vigilance, 0
nor 0
our 0
efforts 0
to 0
improve. 0

We 0
must 0
continue 0
in 0
our 0
work 0
of 0
education 0
for 0
all 0
and 0
hold 0
to 0
the 0
effective 0
policies 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
implemented, 0
requiring 0
psychological 0
exams 0
for 0
all 0
candidates 0
for 0
ministry, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
across-the-board 0
background 0
checks 0
for 0
anyone 0
working 0
with 0
children 0
or 0
vulnerable 0
individuals. 0

Here 0
again, 0
I 0
state, 0
as 0
we 0
have 0
done 0
consistently, 0
if 0
you 0
have 0
knowledge 0
of 0
any 0
sort 0
of 0
criminal 0
abuse 0
of 0
children 0
by 0
someone 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
contact 0
law 0
enforcement. 0

If 0
you 0
need 0
help 0
in 0
contacting 0
law 0
enforcement 0
contact 0
our 0
Victim’s 0
Assistance 0
Coordinator 0
and 0
she 0
will 0
help 0
connect 0
you 0
with 0
the 0
best 0
resources. 0

If 0
you 0
are 0
an 0
adult 0
victim 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
from 0
childhood, 0
we 0
still 0
encourage 0
you 0
to 0
reach 0
out 0
to 0
law 0
enforcement 0
first, 0
but 0
even 0
if 0
you 0
don’t 0
want 0
to, 0
please 0
still 0
reach 0
out 0
to 0
us. 0

To 0
our 0
seminarians: 0
If 0
you 0
are 0
unchastely 0
propositioned, 0
abused, 0
or 0
threatened 0
(no 0
matter 0
by 0
whom), 0
or 0
if 0
you 0
directly 0
witness 0
unchaste 0
behavior, 0
report 0
it 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
seminary 0
rector. 0

I 0
will 0
address 0
it 0
swiftly 1
and 1
vigorously. 1

I 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
for 1
this 1
in 0
my 0
diocese 0
or 0
anywhere 0
I 0
send 0
men 0
for 0
formation. 0

I 0
trust 0
that 0
the 0
seminaries 0
I 0
choose, 0
very 0
discriminately, 0
to 0
help 0
form 0
our 0
men 0
will 0
not 0
ignore 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
scandalous 1
behavior, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
verify 0
that 0
expectation. 0

To 0
our 0
priests: 0
Most 0
simply, 0
live 0
out 0
the 0
promises 0
you 0
made 0
on 0
your 0
ordination 0
day. 0

You 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
serve 0
Christ’s 0
people, 0
beginning 0
with 0
praying 0
daily 0
the 0
Liturgy 0
of 0
the 0
Hours. 0

This 0
is 0
to 0
keep 0
you 0
very 0
close 0
to 0
God. 0

In 0
addition, 0
you 0
promised 0
to 0
obey 0
and 0
be 0
loyal 0
to 0
your 0
bishop. 0

In 0
obedience, 0
strive 0
to 0
live 0
out 0
your 0
priesthood 0
as 1
a 1
holy 1
priest, 1
a 1
hard 1
working 1
priest, 1
and 1
a 1
pure 1
and 1
happy 1
priest 1
— 0
as 0
Christ 0
Himself 0
is 0
calling 0
you 0
to 0
do. 0

And 0
by 0
extension, 0
live 0
a 0
chaste 0
and 0
celibate 0
life 0
so 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
completely 0
give 0
your 0
life 0
to 0
Christ, 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
the 0
people 0
whom 0
he 0
has 0
called 0
you 0
to 0
serve. 0

God 0
will 0
give 0
you 0
the 0
graces 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Ask 0
Him 0
for 0
the 0
help 0
you 0
need 0
daily 0
and 0
throughout 0
every 0
day. 0

And 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
unchastely 0
propositioned, 0
abused, 0
or 0
threatened 0
(no 0
matter 0
by 0
whom), 0
or 0
if 0
you 0
directly 0
witness 0
unchaste 0
behavior, 0
report 0
it 0
to 0
me. 0

I 1
will 1
not 1
stand 1
for 1
this 1
in 0
my 0
diocese 0
any 0
more 0
than 0
in 0
our 0
seminaries. 0

To 0
the 0
faithful 0
of 0
the 0
diocese: 0
If 0
you 0
are 0
the 0
victim 0
of 0
abuse 0
of 0
any 0
kind 0
by 0
a 0
priest, 0
bishop, 0
cardinal, 0
or 0
any 0
employee 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
bring 0
it 0
forward. 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
addressed 0
quickly 0
and 0
justly. 0

If 0
you 0
have 0
directly 0
witnessed 0
sexual 0
advances 0
or 0
any 0
type 0
of 0
abuse, 0
bring 0
it 0
forward 0
as 0
well. 0

Such 0
actions 0
are 0
sinful 1
and 1
scandalous 1
and 0
we 0
cannot 0
allow 0
anyone 0
to 0
use 0
their 0
position 0
or 0
power 0
to 0
abuse 0
another 0
person. 0

Again, 0
in 0
addition 0
to 0
injuring 0
individuals, 0
these 0
actions 0
injure 1
the 1
very 1
Body 1
of 1
Christ, 1
His 1
Church. 1

Furthermore, 0
I 0
add 0
my 0
name 0
to 0
those 0
calling 0
for 0
real 0
and 0
sustained 0
reform 0
in 0
the 0
episcopate, 0
priesthood, 0
our 0
parishes, 0
schools, 0
universities, 0
and 0
seminaries 0
that 0
would 0
root 0
out 0
and 0
hold 0
accountable 0
any 0
would-be 0
sexual 0
predator 0
or 0
accomplice; 0

I 0
will 0
hold 0
the 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
to 0
their 0
promise 0
to 0
live 0
a 0
chaste 0
and 0
celibate 0
life 0
of 0
service 0
to 0
you 0
and 0
your 0
parish, 0
and 0
evidence 0
of 0
failure 0
in 0
this 0
regard 0
will 0
be 0
justly 0
addressed; 0

I 0
will 0
likewise 0
hold 0
every 0
man 0
studying 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood 0
for 0
our 0
diocese 0
accountable 0
to 0
living 0
a 0
chaste 0
and 0
celibate 0
life 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
his 0
formation 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

Failure 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
will 1
lead 1
to 1
dismissal 1
from 1
diocesan 1
sponsorship; 1

I 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
require 0
(with 0
our 0
men 0
and 0
our 0
funds) 0
that 0
all 0
seminaries 0
to 0
which 0
we 0
send 0
men 0
to 0
study 0
be 0
vigilant 0
that 0
seminarians 0
are 0
protected 0
from 0
sexual 0
predators 0
and 0
provide 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
conducive 0
to 0
their 0
holistic 0
formation 0
as 0
holy 0
priests, 0
in 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Christ; 0

I 0
ask 0
all 0
the 0
faithful 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
to 0
assist 0
in 0
keeping 0
us 0
accountable 0
to 0
civil 0
authorities, 0
the 0
faithful 0
in 0
the 0
pews, 0
and 0
to 0
God 0
Almighty, 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
protect 0
children 0
and 0
the 0
youth 0
from 0
sexual 0
predators 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
but 0
our 0
seminarians, 0
university 0
students, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
faithful 0
as 0
well. 0

I 0
promise 0
to 0
put 0
any 0
victim 0
and 0
their 0
sufferings 0
before 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
personal 0
and 0
professional 0
reputation 0
of 0
a 0
priest, 0
or 0
any 0
Church 0
employee, 0
guilty 0
of 0
abuse; 0

I 0
ask 0
everyone 0
reading 0
this 0
to 0
pray. 0

Pray 1
earnestly 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
all 0
her 0
ministers. 0

Pray 1
for 0
our 0
seminarians. 0

And 0
pray 1
for 0
yourselves 0
and 0
your 0
families. 0

We 0
must 0
all 0
work 0
daily 0
on 0
our 1
own 1
personal 1
holiness 1
and 0
hold 0
ourselves 0
accountable 0
first 0
and, 0
in 0
turn, 0
hold 0
our 0
brothers 0
and 0
sisters 0
accountable 0
as 0
well, 0
and 0

Finally, 0
I 0
ask 0
you 0
all 0
to 0
join 0
me 0
and 0
the 0
entire 0
clergy 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison 0
in 0
making 0
public 0
and 0
private 0
acts 0
of 0
reparation 0
to 0
the 0
Most 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
of 0
Jesus 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
Heart 0
of 0
Mary 0
for 0
all 0
the 0
sins 0
of 0
sexual 0
depravity 0
committed 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
and 0
episcopacy. 0

I 1
will 1
be 1
offering 1
a 1
public 1
Mass 1
of 1
reparation 1
on 1
Friday, 1
September 1
14, 1
the 1
Feast 1
of 1
the 1
Triumph 1
of 1
the 1
Holy 1
Cross, 1
at 1
Holy 1
Name 1
Heights 1
and 1
I 1
ask 1
all 1
pastors 1
to 1
do 1
the 1
same 1
in 1
their 1
own 1
parishes. 1

In 0
addition, 0
I 0
ask 0
that 0
all 0
priests, 0
clergy, 0
religious, 0
and 0
diocesan 0
employees 0
join 0
me 0
in 0
observing 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Autumn 0
Ember 0
Days 0
(Sep. 0
19, 0
21, 0
and 0
22) 0
as 0
days 0
of 0
fasting 0
and 0
abstinence 0
in 0
reparation 0
for 0
the 0
sins 1
and 1
outrages 1
committed 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
and 0
episcopacy 0
and 0
I 0
invite 0
all 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
same. 0

Some 0
sins, 0
like 0
some 0
demons, 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
driven 0
out 0
by 0
prayer 0
and 0
fasting. 0

This 0
letter 0
and 0
these 0
statements 0
and 0
promises 0
are 0
not 0
intended 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
exhaustive 0
list 0
of 0
what 0
we 0
can 0
and 0
need 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
begin 0
to 0
heal 0
from, 0
and 0
stave 1
off, 1
this 1
deep 1
illness 1
in 1
the 1
Church, 1
but 0
rather 0
the 0
next 0
steps 0
I 0
believe 0
we 0
can 0
take 0
locally. 0

More 0
than 0
anything 0
else, 0
we 0
as 0
a 0
Church 0
must 0
cease 0
our 0
acceptance 0
of 0
sin 0
and 0
evil. 0

We 0
must 0
cast 1
out 1
sin 1
from 1
our 1
own 1
lives 1
and 1
run 1
toward 1
holiness. 1

We 0
must 0
refuse 0
to 0
be 0
silent 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
sin 0
and 0
evil 0
in 0
our 0
families 0
and 0
communities 0
and 0
we 0
must 0
demand 0
from 0
our 0
pastors 0
— 0
myself 0
included 0
— 0
that 0
they 0
themselves 0
are 0
striving 0
day 0
in 0
and 0
day 0
out 0
for 0
holiness. 0

We 0
must 0
do 0
this 0
always 0
with 0
loving 0
respect 0
for 0
individuals 0
but 0
with 0
a 0
clear 0
understanding 0
that 0
true 0
love 0
can 0
never 0
exist 0
without 0
truth. 0

Again, 0
right 0
now 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
justified 0
anger 0
and 0
passion 0
coming 0
from 0
many 0
holy 0
and 0
faithful 0
lay 0
people 0
and 0
clerics 0
across 0
the 0
country, 0
calling 0
for 0
real 0
reform 0
and 0
“house 0
cleaning” 0
of 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
depravity. 0

I 0
stand 0
with 0
them. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
yet 0
how 0
this 0
will 0
play 0
out 0
nationally 0
or 0
internationally. 0

But 0
I 0
do 0
know 0
this, 0
and 0
I 0
make 0
this 0
my 0
last 0
point 0
and 0
last 0
promise, 0
for 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Madison: 0
“As 0
for 0
me 0
and 0
my 0
household, 0
we 1
will 1
serve 1
the 1
Lord.” 1

Faithfully 0

BUDAPEST, 0
Feb 0
18 0
(Reuters) 0
- 0
Hungarian 0
leader 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
called 0
on 0
Sunday 0
for 0
a 0
global 0
alliance 0
against 0
migration 0
as 0
his 0
right-wing 0
populist 0
Fidesz 0
party 0
began 0
campaigning 0
for 0
an 0
April 0
8 0
election 0
in 0
which 0
it 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
win 0
a 0
third 0
consecutive 0
landslide 0
victory. 0

Popular 0
at 0
home 0
but 0
increasingly 0
at 0
odds 0
politically 0
and 0
economically 0
with 0
mainstream 0
European 0
Union 0
peers, 0
Orban 0
has 0
thrived 0
on 0
external 0
controversy, 0
including 0
repeated 0
clashes 0
with 0
Brussels 0
and 0
lately 0
the 0
United 0
Nations. 0

Those 0
conflicts, 0
mostly 0
centred 0
on 0
migration 0
since 0
people 0
fleeing 0
war 0
and 0
poverty 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
and 0
Africa 0
flooded 0
into 0
Europe 0
in 0
2015, 0
have 0
intensified 0
as 0
the 0
elections 0
approach 0
and 0
Orban 1
poses 1
as 1
a 1
saviour 1
of 1
Europe's 1
Christian 1
nations. 1

"Christianity 1
is 1
Europe's 1
last 1
hope," 1
Orban 0
told 0
an 0
audience 0
of 0
party 0
faithful 0
at 0
the 0
foot 0
of 0
the 0
Royal 0
Castle 0
in 0
Budapest. 0

With 0
mass 0
immigration, 0
especially 0
from 0
Africa, 0
"our 1
worst 1
nightmares 1
can 1
come 1
true. 1

The 1
West 1
falls 1
as 1
it 1
fails 1
to 1
see 1
Europe 1
being 1
overrun." 1

Orban 0
is 0
widely 0
credited 0
for 0
reversing 0
an 0
economic 0
slump 0
in 0
Hungary 0
and 0
controlling 0
its 0
public 0
finances, 0
culminating 0
in 0
a 0
return 0
to 0
investment-grade 0
for 0
its 0
debt, 0
which 0
was 0
cut 0
to 0
'junk' 0
during 0
the 0
2008 0
global 0
economic 0
crisis. 0

To 0
achieve 0
that 0
and 0
hold 0
onto 0
power 0
the 0
prime 0
minister, 0
54, 0
has 0
used 0
methods 0
that 0
critics 0
have 0
called 0
authoritarian, 0
and 0
picked 0
fights 0
with 0
EU 0
partners, 0
especially 0
in 0
the 0
West. 0

Eastern 0
leaders, 0
most 0
notably 0
in 0
Poland, 0
have 0
followed 0
his 0
lead. 0

But 0
migration 0
dominates 0
his 0
agenda 0
now. 0

Orban 0
said 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
Europe 0
faces 0
a 0
critical 0
fissure 0
between 0
nation 0
states 0
of 0
the 0
East 0
and 0
the 0
West, 0
which 0
he 0
called 0
an 0
"immigrant 0
zone, 0
a 0
mixed 0
population 0
world 0
that 0
heads 0
in 0
a 1
direction 1
different 1
from 1
ours". 1

As 0
the 0
West 0
wants 0
eastern 0
Europe 0
to 0
follow 0
its 0
lead, 0
an 0
increasingly 1
vicious 1
struggle 1
was 0
likely, 0
he 0
said, 0
alluding 0
to 0
a 0
plan 0
to 0
redraw 0
the 0
European 0
alliance 0
advocated 0
by 0
the 0
leaders 0
of 0
France 0
and 0
Germany. 0

"Absurd 0
as 0
it 0
may 0
sound 0
the 1
danger 1
we 1
face 1
comes 1
from 1
the 1
West, 1
from 1
politicians 1
in 1
Brussels, 1
Berlin 1
and 1
Paris," 1
Orban 0
said 0
to 0
loud 0
applause. 0

"Of 0
course 0
we 0
will 0
fight, 0
and 0
use 0
ever 0
stronger 0
legal 0
tools. 0

The 0
first 0
is 0
our 0
'Stop 1
Soros' 1
law." 0

Orban 0
has 0
for 0
years 0
targeted 0
Hungarian-born 0
U.S. 0
financier 0
George 0
Soros, 0
whose 0
philanthropy 0
aims 0
to 0
bolster 0
liberal 0
and 0
open-border 0
values 0
-- 0
anathema 0
to 0
Orban, 0
an 0
advocate 0
of 0
a 0
loose 0
group 0
of 0
strong 0
nation 0
states 0
that 0
reject 0
multiculturalism. 0

The 0
Hungarian 0
leader 0
has 0
advocated 0
"ethnic 0
homogeneity" 0
and 0
compared 0
Soros, 0
a 0
Jew, 0
to 0
a 0
puppet 1
master 1
unleashing 1
immigration 1
onto 1
Europe 1
to 0
undermine 0
its 0
cultural 0
and 0
economic 0
integrity. 0

A 0
defining 0
moment 0
of 0
his 0
premiership 0
came 0
in 0
2015, 0
as 0
the 0
migrant 0
crisis 0
peaked: 0
he 0
built 0
a 0
double 0
razor 0
wire 0
fence 0
that 0
became 0
the 0
symbol 0
of 0
anti-migrant 0
sentiment 0
in 0
Europe. 0

Orban 0
also 0
said 0
the 0
Hungarian 0
opposition 0
had 0
failed 0
to 0
heed 0
the 0
call 0
of 0
history 0
when 0
it 0
opposed 0
his 0
toughness 0
on 0
migrants. 0

Voters 0
have 0
responded 0
favourably 0
and 0
Orban 0
is 0
a 0
clear 0
leader 0
of 0
all 0
polls. 0

POWERFUL 0
ALLIES 0

Orban 0
has 0
conflated 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
immigration 0
with 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Soros, 0
87, 0
whose 0
name 0
was 0
used 0
in 0
a 0
tough 0
anti-migrant 0
bill 0
sent 0
to 0
Parliament 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

Soros, 0
for 0
his 0
part, 0
compared 1
Orban 1
unfavourably 1
to 1
both 1
the 1
Nazis 1
and 1
the 1
Communists, 1
saying 0
his 0
rule 0
evoked 0
dark 0
tones 0
from 0
the 0
1930's 0
-- 0
when 0
Hungary 0
was 0
allied 0
with 0
Nazi 0
Germany 0
-- 0
and 0
was 0

Schaaf, 0

Saturday, 0
writing 0
that 0
“multiple 0

However, 0
in 0
their 0
statement, 0
Facebook 0
then 0
suggested 0
the 0
real 0
reason 0
behind 0
the 0
purge 0
— 0
elections 0
are 0
coming 0
— 0
and 0
pesky 1
folks 1
like 0
the 0
independent 0
media 0
have 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
reporting 0
information 0
on 0
candidates 0
that 0
the 0
mainstream 0
tends 0
to 0
ignore 0
— 0
like 0
war, 0
corruption, 0
and 0
most 0
recently, 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
disdain 0
for 0

“Given 0
the 0
activity 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
— 0
and 0
its 0
timing 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
midterm 0
elections 0
— 0
we 0
wanted 0
to 0
give 0
some 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
types 0
of 0
behavior 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
this 0
action,” 0
Facebook 0
said, 0
before 0
accusing 0
us 0
of 0
hawking 0
fake 0
products 0
or 0
functioning 0
as 0
ad 0
farms 0
that 0
tricked 0
“people 0
into 0
thinking 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
forums 0
for 0
legitimate 0
political 0
debate.” 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
stated 0
that 0
TFTP 0
never 0
hid 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
we 0
worked 0
with 0
other 0
independent 0
media 0
groups 0
to 0
share 0
our 0
information 0
around 0
the 0
web 0
— 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
grassroots. 0

But 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
together 0
certainly 0
posed 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
mainstream 0
so 0
this 0
nonsense 1
about 0
tricking 0
people 0
was 0
brought 0
into 0
play. 0

Within 0
all 0
of 0
our 0
pages 0
under 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
umbrella, 0
we 0
had 0
close 0
to 0
6 0
million 0
followers. 0

Does 0
Facebook 0
think 0
it 0
knows 0
better 0
than 0
the 0
6 0
million 0
people 0
who 0
clicked 0
like 0
on 0
our 0

We 0
also 0
had 0
close 0
to 0
16,000 0
reviews 0
on 0
our 0
page 0
with 0
an 0
average 0
4.1 0
star 0
rating, 0
directly 0
showing 0
that 0
people 0
desired 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
we 0
were 0
putting 0
out. 0

The 0
only 0
ones 0
manipulating 0
people 0
here 0
are 0
the 0
tech 0
giants 0
themselves. 0

All 0
but 0
proving 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
coordinated 0
attack 0
by 0
the 0
tech 0
giant 0
community, 0
shortly 0
after 0
the 0
purge 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
Twitter 0
followed 0
suit, 0
wiping 0
out 0
our 0
profiles 0
on 0
there 0
as 0
well. 0

They 0
gave 0
absolutely 0
no 0
reason 0
for 0
the 0
suspension. 0

“This 0
signifies 0
a 0
re-consolidation 0
of 0
the 0
media. 0

Cable 0
news 0
media 0
controlled 0
the 0
narrative 0
for 0
most 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
but 0
the 0
internet 0
has 0
lowered 0
that 0
barrier 0
to 0
entry 0
and 0
allowed 0
the 0
average 0
person 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
media 0
themselves. 0

This 0
obviously 0
took 0
market 0
share 0
and 0
influence 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
traditional 0
media, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
allowed 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
diverse 0
public 0
conversation. 0

Now 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
platforms 0
that 0
have 0
monopolized 0
the 0
industry 0
are 0
favoring 0
mainstream 0
sources 0
and 0
silencing 0
alternative 0
voices. 0

So 0
now, 0
instead 0
of 0
allowing 0
more 0
people 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
voice, 0
these 0
platforms 0
are 0
creating 0
an 0
atmosphere 0
where 0
only 0
powerful 0
media 0
organizations 0
are 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
we 0
had 0
on 0
cable 0

John 0

poignantly 0
noted. 0

The 0
bottom 0
line 0
is 0
that 0
sites 0
like 0
ours 0
and 0
the 0
others 0
who 0
were 0
wiped 0
from 0
the 0
internet 0
yesterday 0
represent 0
a 0
voice 0
against 0
the 0
plutocratic 1

establishment. 1

We 0
challenge 0
their 0
paradigm 0
of 0
control 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
thorn 0
in 0
their 0

are 0
no 0
longer 0
distinct 0

between 0

Indeed, 0
we 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
precipice 0
of 0
corporate-state 0
censorship. 0

Those 0
who 0
have 0
constantly 0
demanded 0
that 0
tech 0
giants 0
silence 0
their 0
critics 0
and 0
information 0
that 0
‘offends’ 0
them 0
are 0
finally 0
seeing 0
the 0
inevitable 1
results 0
of 0
such 0
irresponsible 1
acts. 0

As 0
we 0
have 0
been 0
pointing 0
out 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
tech 0
monopolies 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
silence 0
those 0
with 0
whom 0
you 0
disagree, 0
are 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
one 0
day 0
silence 0
you. 0

The 0
silver 0
lining 0
to 0
this 0
massive 0
purge 0
of 0
independent 0
media 0

that 0
it 0
signals 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0

commentators 0
for 0
relying 0
on 0
supposedly 0
apocryphal 0

bearing 0
on 0

But 0
these 0
critics 0
never 0
demonstrate 0
that 0
the 0
oft-cited 0
quotations 0
are 0
apocryphal; 0
they 0
merely 0
assert 0
that 0
they 0
must 0
be, 0
as 0
they 0
seem 0

no 0

for 0
a 0

he 1
hasn’t 1
bothered 1
to 1
do 1
any 1
serious 1
investigation 1
beyond 1

Take 0
this 0
quotation 0
of 0
Pius 0
XII, 0
for 0
example, 0
speaking 0
in 0
1931 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
Monsignor 0
Pacelli, 0
serving 0
as 0
Pius 0
XI’s 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State: 0

I 0
am 0
worried 0
by 0
the 0
Blessed 0
Virgin’s 0
messages 0
to 0
Lucy 0
of 0
Fatima. 0

This 0
persistence 0
of 0
Mary 0
about 0
the 0
dangers 0
which 0
menace 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
a 0
divine 0
warning 0
against 0
the 0
suicide 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
represented 0
by 0
the 0
alteration 0
of 0
the 0
faith, 0
in 0
her 0
liturgy, 0
her 0
theology 0
and 0
her 0
soul…. 0

I 0

hear 0
all 0
around 0
me 0
innovators 1
who 1
wish 1
to 1
dismantle 1
the 1
Sacred 1
Chapel, 1
destroy 1
the 1
universal 1
flame 1
of 1
the 1
Church, 1
reject 1
her 1
ornaments 1
and 1
make 1
her 1
feel 1
remorse 1
for 1
her 1
historical 1
past. 1

A 0

day 0
will 0
come 0
when 0
the 0
civilized 0
world 0
will 0
deny 0
its 0
God, 0
when 0
the 0
Church 0
will 0
doubt 0
as 0
Peter 0
doubted. 0

She 0
will 0
be 0
tempted 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
man 0
has 0
become 0
God. 0

In 0
our 0
churches, 0
Christians 1
will 1
search 1
in 1
vain 1
for 1
the 1
red 1
lamp 1
where 1
God 1
awaits 1
them. 1

Like 1
Mary 1
Magdalene, 1
weeping 1
before 1
the 1
empty 1
tomb, 1
they 0
will 0
ask, 0
“Where 0
have 0
they 0
taken 0
Him?” 0

When 0
I 0
first 0
cited 0
this 0
quotation 0
some 0
17 0
years 0
ago, 0
I 0
was 0
contacted 0
by 0
a 0
very 0
prominent 0
neo-Catholic 0
luminary 0
who 0
demanded 0
a 0
source 0
for 0
it, 0
because 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
friends 0
believed 0
it 0
was 0
“apocryphal.” 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
receive 0
the 0
courtesy 0
of 0
a 0
thank-you 0
when 0
I 0
pointed 0
him 0
to 0
pp. 0

52-53 0
of 0
Msgr. 0

Roche’s 0
biography 0
of 0
Pius 0
XII, 0
Pie 0
XII 0
Devant 0
L’Histoire 0
(Paris: 0
Editions 0
Robert 0
Laffont, 0
1972), 0
an 0
out-of-print 0
French-language 0
work 0
I 0
managed 0
to 0
obtain 0
after 0
an 0
extensive 0
search 0
of 0
used 0
book 0
seller 0
inventory. 0

The 0
French 0
original 0
text 0
confirms 0
the 0
accuracy 0
of 0
the 0
English 0
translation 0
I 0
had 0
seen 0
before 0
I 0
cited 0
the 0
statement. 0

A 0

Modernist 0
apostate 0
priest, 0
one 0
Emile 0
Poulet, 0
who 0
left 0
the 0
priesthood 0
and 0
married, 0
attempted 0
to 0
cast 0
doubt 0
on 0
the 0
credibility 0
of 0
Msgr. 0

Roche’s 0
account 0
of 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
future 0
Pius 0
XII. 0

Small 0
wonder: 0
Poulet, 0
who 0
died 0
in 0
2014 0
at 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
94, 0
belonged 0
to 0
the 0
“worker-priest” 0
movement 0
that 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Pius 0
XII 0
had 0
condemned, 0
as 0
I 0
note 0
here. 0

His 0
attempt 0
to 0
debunk 0
the 0
quotation 0
involved 0
nit-picking 0
about 0
what 1
he 1
claimed 1
were 1
factual 1
errors 1
elsewhere 1
in 1
the 1
Roche 1
biography. 1

But 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
evidence 1
that 1
the 1
quotation 1
as 1
such 1
was 1
a 1
fabrication. 1

He 1
simply 1
wished 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
so. 1

Let’s 1

give 1
our 1
neo-Catholic 1
friends 1
another 1
“apocryphal” 1
quotation 1
to 1
dismiss 1
out 1
of 1
hand. 1

This 0
one 0
pertains 0
to 0
an 1
astonishing 1
prophecy 1
by 0
Saint 0
Francis 0
of 0
Assisi 0
about 0
a 0
future 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
Peter: 0

A 0

short 0
time 0
before 0
the 0
holy 0
Father’s 0
[St. 0
Francis’] 0
death, 0
he 0
called 0
together 0
his 0
children 0
and 0
warned 0
them 0
of 0
the 0
coming 0
troubles: 0

“Act 1

bravely, 1
my 1
brethren; 1
take 1
courage 1
and 1
trust 1
in 1
the 1
Lord. 1

The 0
time 0
is 0
fast 0
approaching 0
in 0
which 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
great 0
trials 0
and 0
afflictions; 0
perplexities 0
and 0
dissensions, 0
both 0
spiritual 0
and 0
temporal, 0
will 0
abound; 0
the 0
charity 0
of 0
many 0
will 0
grow 0
cold, 0
and 0
the 1
malice 1
of 1
the 1
wicked 1
will 1
increase. 1

The 1
devils 1
will 1
have 1
unusual 1
power; 1
the 1
immaculate 1
purity 1
of 1
our 1

“Doubtful 0

of 0
which 0
the 0

Thus, 0
the 0

itself 0
carefully 0
distinguished 0
the 0
authentic 0
prophecies 0
of 0
Saint 0
Francis 0
from 0
what 0
might 0
be 0
apocryphal. 0

Moreover, 0
in 0

any 0

"St. 0
Francis 0

Saint 0
Francis’ 0
prophecy 0
is 0
clearly 0
not 0
a 0
prediction 0
of 0
the 0
Great 0
Western 0
Schism 0
(1378-1417), 0
which 0
did 0
not 0
involve 0
a 0
“destroyer” 0
on 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
Peter 0
who 0
leads 0
the 0
faithful 0
into 0
error, 0
widespread 0
apostasy, 0
and 0
the 0
persecution 0
of 0
faithful 0
Catholics 0
as 0
“schismatics.” 0
But 0
it 0
does 0
contain 0
elements 0
very 0
familiar 0
to 0
us 0
today. 0

And 1
what 1
inference 1
might 1
one 1
draw 1
from 1
the 1
coincidence 1
that 1
Saint 1
Francis’ 1
prophecy 1
of 1
a 1
future 1
“destroyer” 1
in 1
the 1
papal 1
office 1
seems 1
to 1
correspond 1
rather 1
well 1
with 1
the 1
pontificate 1
of 1
the 1
only 1
Pope 1
who 1
has 1
taken 1
Francis’ 1
name 1
as 1
his 1
own? 1

Something 0

else 0
to 0
consider: 0
Saint 0
Francis, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
greatest 0
saints 0
in 0
Church 0
history, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
few 0
who 0
is 0
known 0
and 0
revered 0
by 0
the 0
whole 0
world, 0
freely 0
revealed 0
his 0
vision 0
of 0
an 0
ecclesial 0
destroyer 0
who 0
usurps 0
the 0
papal 0
office. 0

That 0
is, 0
Saint 0
Francis 0
did 0
not 0
suffer 0
from 0
the 0
currently 0
reigning 0
papolatry, 0
which 0
holds 0
that 0
the 0
indefectibility 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
depends 0
upon 0
defending 0
every 0
word 0
and 0
deed 0
of 0
a 0
given 0
Pope 0
as 0
somehow 0
consistent 0
with 0
Tradition 0
and 0
declares 0
absolutely 0
inadmissible 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
the 0
holder 0
of 0
the 0
Petrine 0
office 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
Faith. 0

Rather, 0
Saint 0
Francis, 0
illuminated 0
by 0
heaven 0
itself, 0
recognized 0
the 0
coming 0
reality 0
of 0
what 0
Saint 0
Robert 0
Bellarmine, 0
a 0
Doctor 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
hypothesized 0
as 0
possible 0
in 0
principle, 0
to 0
cite 0
another 0
“apocryphal” 0
quotation: 0

Just 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
licit 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
Pontiff 0
that 0
aggresses 0
the 0

it 0
is 0
also 0
licit 0

the 0
one 0
who 0
aggresses 0
souls 0
or 0
who 0
disturbs 0
civil 0
order, 0
or, 0
above 0
all, 0
who 0
attempts 0
to 0
destroy 0
the 0

I 0
say 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
licit 0
to 0
resist 0
by 0
not 0
doing 0
what 0

the 0

arrived 0

after 0

shift. 0

The 0

reported 0

that 0
she 0

believing 0

her 0
own. 0

At 0

the 0

fired 0
her 0

striking 0
the 0

the 0

a 0

at 0

I 0
have 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
you 0
can 0
enter 0
an 0

mistakenly. 0

Does 0
Guyger 0
leave 0
her 0
door 0
unlocked? 0

Furthermore, 0
The 0
Dallas 0
News 0
reports: 0

Jean, 0
who 0
lived 0
on 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
South 0
Side 0
Flats 0
in 0
the 0
Cedars, 0
was 0
home 0
alone 0
when 0
Guyger 0
mistook 0
his 0
apartment 0
for 0
hers, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

Guyger 0
lived 0
on 0
the 0
third 0
floor, 0
directly 0
beneath 0
his 0
apartment, 0
and 0
mistakenly 0
parked 0
on 0
the 0
fourth 0
floor 0
after 0
finishing 0
a 0
shift 0
at 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

When 0
she 0
arrived 0
at 0
Jean's 0
door, 0
Guyger 0
entered 0
a 0
unique 0
door 0
key 0
with 0
an 0
electronic 0
chip 0
into 0
the 0
keyhole, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

The 0
door 0
was 0
already 0
ajar, 0
so 0
the 0
force 0
of 0
pushing 0
the 0
key 0
inside 0
opened 0
the 0
door, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
affidavit. 0

The 1
affidavit 1
says 1
the 0
apartments' 0
"respective 0
interior 0
floorplans 0
are 0
in 0
most 0
ways 0
identical 0
or 0
extremely 0
similar." 0

The 0
apartment 0
was 0
dark 0
and 0
when 0
she 0
saw 0
"a 0
large 0
silhouette," 0
Guyger 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
being 0
burglarized, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

The 1
affidavit 1
says 1
Guyger 0
drew 0
her 0
gun, 0
"gave 0
verbal 0
commands 0
that 0
were 0
ignored" 0
and 0
fired 0
twice. 0

Jean 0
was 0
struck 0
once 0
in 0
the 0
torso. 0

Guyger 0
then 0
called 0
911 0
from 0
her 0
cellphone 0
and 0
started 0
performing 0
first 0
aid. 0

She 0
turned 0
on 0
the 0
lights, 0
then 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
front 0
door 0
again 0
and 0
realized 0
the 0
apartment 0
wasn't 0
hers, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
says. 1

She 0
told 0
the 0
911 0
operator 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
responding 0
officers 0
that 0
she 0
thought 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
her 0
apartment 0
when 0
she 0
shot 0
Jean, 0
according 1
to 1
the 1
affidavit. 1

Ok, 0
some 0
of 0
this 0
seems 0
plausible, 0
but 0
I 0
still 0
am 0
left 0
wondering 0
about 0
the 0
door 0
being 0
ajar. 0

Is 0
this 0
something 0
people 0
are 0
prone 0
to 0
do 0
at 0
1o 0
o'clock 0
at 0
night 0
in 0
Dallas? 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
we 0
all 0
know 0
that 0
any 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
would 0
have 0
immediately 0
been 0
taken 0
into 0
custody. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
case 0
with 0
Guyger, 0
though 0
one 0
officer 0
close 0
to 0
her 0
said, 0
"she 0
is 0
devastated." 0

Knowing 0
this 0
provoked 0
outrage 0
across 0
the 0
nation 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
her 0
first 0
shooting. 0

As 0
a 0
four-year 0
veteran 0
of 0
the 0
force, 0
she 0
was 0
also 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
shooting 0
of 0
another 0
suspect 0
in 0
2017. 0

The 0

In 0

Guyger 0
shot 0
47-year-old 0
Uvaldo 0
Perez, 0
who 0
had 0
wrestled 0
a 0
Taser 0
away 0
from 0
her. 0

Another 0

When 0

with 0
two 0
men 0
in 0
the 0
8300 0
block 0

the 0
officer 0
asked 0
for 0
backup 0
from 0
Guyger 0
and 0
another 0
officer, 0
according 0
to 0
an 0
affidavit. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
officers 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
search 0
Perez 0
when 0
he 0
became 0
combative, 0
the 1
affidavit 1
said. 1

Guyger 0
deployed 0
her 0
Taser 0
before 0
Perez 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
take 0
it 0
from 0
her. 0

After 0
Perez 0
had 0
the 0
Taser, 0
Guyger 0
fired 0
her 0
gun 0
once, 0
striking 0
him 0
in 0
the 0
abdomen, 0
the 0
affidavit 0
said. 0

Neither 0
Guyger 0
nor 0
the 0
other 0
officers 0
were 0
injured 0
in 0
the 0
2017 0
shooting. 0

on 0

of 0
taking 0

of 0

violating 0

In 0

"What’s 0
wrong 0
with 0
me?" 0

I 0
laughingly 0
replied. 0

I 0
said, 0
"Mom, 0
when 0
I 0

in 0
the 1

(1 0
John 0

This 0
reminds 0
me 0
of 0
when 0
I 0
gave 0
a 0
prayer 0
at 0
the 0
state 0
capital 0
in 0
Minnesota. 0

After 0
the 0
prayer 0
was 0
over, 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
minister 0
come 0
up 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
tell 0
me 0
that 0
I 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
dropping 0
the 0
“J” 0
(Jesus) 0
word 0
in 0
the 0
capital. 0

I 0
said 0
that 0
the 1
reason 1
I 1
dropped 1
the 1
“J” 1
word 1
was 1
because 1
you 1
haven’t 1
in 1
40 1
years 1
(Romans 0
1:16). 0

What 0
of 0
public 0
high 0

across 0
the 0
country 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
been 0
going 0
into 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
educate 0
the 0

as 0
to 0
who 0
we 0
are, 0
and 0
not 0
what 0
the 1
revisionists 1
and 1
propagandists 1
would 0
have 0
them 0
believe 0
that 0
we 0
are. 0

We 0
have 0
shown 0
the 0
young 0
people 0
that 0
abortion 1
is 1
murder 1
and 1
that 1
58 1
million 1
babies 1
have 1
been 1
murdered 1
since 1
1973 1
under 1
the 1
guise 1
of 1
woman’s 1
choice 1
(Proverbs 0
6:17). 0

We 1
got 1
kicked 1
out 1
of 1
a 1
public 1
school 1
for 1
re-enforcing 1
America’s 1
value’s 1
by 1
teaching 1
the 1
US 1
Constitution. 1

We 0
have 0
taught 0
that 0
homosexuality 1
is 1
an 1
abomination, 1
and 0
how 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
felony 0
in 0
every 0
state 0
in 0
our 0
union 0
(Leviticus 0
18:22; 0

How 0
true 0
Scripture 0
is 0
when 0
it 0
declares: 0

“Woe 0
unto 0
them 0
that 0
call 0
evil 0
good, 0
and 0
good 0
evil; 0
that 0
put 0
darkness 0

light 0

darkness; 0
that 0

bitter 0

sweet 0
for 0
bitter!" 0

No 0
wonder 0
why 0
the 1
reprobates 1
and 1
hypocrites 1
thought 0
that 0
the 0
Christians 0
who 0
were 0

were 0
turning 0
the 0
world 0
upside 0

They 0
were, 0
in 0

turning 0

right 0
side 0
up 0
(Acts 0
17:6). 0

Identifying 0
the 0
genuine 0
from 0
the 0
counterfeit 0

Last 0
week, 0
I 0
had 0
a 0
woman 0
come 0
up 0
to 0
me 0
at 0
my 0
last 0
meeting 0
in 0
Amery, 0
Wisconsin. 0

She 0
said 0
that 0
she 0
did 0
her 0
research 0
on 0
me 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
media 0
really 0
attacked 0
me. 0

I 0
responded 0
with, 0
"Of 1
course 1
they 1
did, 1
and 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
still 1
do." 1

They 1
are 1
being 1
exposed 1
for 1
who 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
like 1
it. 1

(John 0
15:22). 0

I 0
told 0
her 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
too 0
many 0
counterfeits, 1
self-proclaimed 1
leaders, 1
out 0
there 0
who 1
care 1
more 1
about 1
saving 1
face, 1
than 1
they 1
do 1
the 1
souls 1
of 1
men 1
(Luke 1
19:10), 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
saving 1
their 1
country. 1

Apparently 0
they 0
have 0
a 0
reputation 0
to 0
keep 0
up. 0

Philippians 0
2:7-9 0

These 0
are 0
those 0
that 0
sit 0
behind 0
the 0
status 0
of 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
church 0
or 0
political 1
leader 1
of 1
the 1
pack. 1

Yet, 1
you 1
do 1
not 1
see 1
any 1
warfare 1
or 1
opposition 1
around 1
them 1
and 1
why? 1

because 1
they 1
have 1
simply 1
forsaken 1
the 1
cross. 1

There 0
is 0
no 0
absolutes 0
with 0
these 0
people. 0

They 1
are 1
people 1
pleasers 1
and 1
nothing 1
more. 1

After 0
all 0
you 0
can 0
always 0
tell 0
what 0
a 0
man 0
stands 0
for 0
by 0
the 0
enemies 0
that 0
he 0
has. 0

They 0
hide 1
behind 1
a 1
microphone 1
day 0
after 0
day. 0

Yet, 0
they 0
fail 0
to 0
confront 0
the 0
issues 0
that 0
needed 0
to 0
be 0
confronted. 0

The 1
reason 1
they 1
don't 1
is 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
guilty 1
of 1
what 1
they 1
fail 1
to 1
confront! 1

They 0
are 0
paper 1
tigers. 1

They 1
can 1
write 1
all 1
big 1
and 1
bad 1
but 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
what 1
someone 1
else 1
should 1
do. 1

However, 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
time 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
put 1
boots 1
on 1
the 1
ground, 1
they 1
are 1
simply 1
missing 1
in 1
action 1
(MIA). 1

These 0
are 0
willing 0
to 1
live 1
in 1
the 1
freest 1
country 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
as 0
long 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
them 0
that 0
have 0
to 0
sacrifice 0
to 0
maintain 0
it. 0

There 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
people 0
out 0
there 0
that 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
friends 0
with 0
everyone 0
(and 0
have 0
to 0
apologize 0
to 0
any 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
have 0
told 0
the 0
truth 0
lest 0
they 0
should 0
convict 1
them 1
unto 1
godly 1
repentance 1
(2 0
Corinthians 0
7:10) 0
as 0
they 0
congregate 0
week 0
after 0
week 0
deceiving 1
themselves 1
into 1
believing 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
demanding 1
a 1
lawful 1
change 1
just 1
as 1
long 1
as 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
offend 1
anyone 1
(Matthew 0
5:10). 0

As 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
fact, 0
these 1
counterfeits 1
will 1
be 1
the 1
first 1
ones 1
to 1
get 1
angry 1
with 1
and 1
denounce 1
and 1
attack 1
the 1
ones 1
that 1
are 1
sent 1
by 1
the 1
Spirit 1
of 1
God 1
(Galatians 0
4:29). 0

Maybe 0
this 0
group 0
of 0
people 0
should 0
ask 0
their 0
enemies 0
for 0
instructions 0
as 0
to 0
how 0
change 0
is 0
brought 0
about, 0
and 0
in 1
a 1
righteous 1
sense 1
reverse 1
the 1
lawlessness-taking 1
place 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
(Matthew 0
24:12). 0

These 1
groups 1
of 1
people 1
are 1
simply 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
cross 1
of 1
Christ 1
and 1
know 1
not 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
God 1
unto 1
salvation 1
(Philippians 0
3:18). 0

Furthermore, 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
this 0
woman 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
how 0
you 0
can 0
tell 0
who 0
the 1
genuine 1
Christians 1
are 0
that 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
fight 0
and 0
those 1
who 1
are 1
counterfeits. 1

When 0
the 0
church 0
and 0
the 0
world 0
can 0
jog 1
comfortably 1
along 1
together, 1
you 0
can 0
be 0
sure 0
something 0
is 0
wrong. 0

The 0
world 0
has 0
not 0
compromised—its 0
spirit 0
is 0
exactly 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
it 0
ever 0
was. 0

If 1
Christians 1
were 1
equally 1
as 1
faithful 1
to 1
the 1
Lord, 1
separated 1
from 1
the 1
world 1
(2 1
Corinthians 1
6:17), 1
and 1
living 1
so 1
that 1
their 1
lives 1
were 1
a 1
reproof 1
to 1
all 1
ungodliness, 1
the 1
world 1
would 1
hate 1
them 1
as 1
much 1
as 1
it 1
ever 1
did. 1

(John 0
7:7) 0
It 0
is 0
the 0
church 0
that 0
has 0
compromised, 0
not 0
the 0
world. 0

way 0
to 0
gauge 0
those 0
who 0

the 1

“Islamophobia” 0
and 0
“bigotry.” 0
But 0
no 0
one 0
will 0
take 0
any 0
particular 0
notice 0
of 0
this. 0

They 0
should, 0
however. 0

Khecharem 0
is 0
not 0
some 0
deluded 0
fanatic 0
raving 0
on 0
a 0
Tunisian 0
street 0
corner. 0

He 0
was 0
speaking 0
at 0
Hizb 0
ut-Tahrir’s 0
International 0
Caliphate 0
Conference; 0
although 0
Hizb 0
ut-Tahrir 0
is 0
banned 0
in 0
many 0
countries, 0
it 0
still 0
has 0
an 0
international 0
presence, 0
and 0
recently 0
held 0
a 0
conference 0
in 0
Chicago. 0

Nor 0
is 0
the 0
desire 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
global 0
caliphate 0
limited 0
to 0
Hizb 0
ut-Tahrir 0
alone. 0

The 0
word 0
khalifa 0
means 0
“successor”; 0
the 0
caliph 0
in 0
Sunni 0
Islamic 0
theology 0
is 0
the 0
successor 0
of 0
Muhammad 0
as 0
the 0
military, 0
political, 0
and 0
spiritual 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Muslims. 0

As 0
I 0
show 0
in 0
my 0
book 0
The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
From 0
Muhammad 0
to 0
ISIS 0
, 0
the 0
great 0
caliphates 0
of 0
history, 0
from 0
the 0
immediate 0
post-Muhammad 0
period 0
of 0
the 0
“Rightly 0
Guided 0
Caliphs” 0
to 0
the 0
Umayyads, 0
Abbasids, 0
and 0
Ottomans, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
other 0
Islamic 0
states, 0
all 0
waged 0
relentless 0
jihad 0
warfare 0
against 0
non-Muslims, 0
subjugating 0
them 0
under 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
Islamic 0
law 0
and 0
denying 0
them 0
basic 0
rights. 0

These 0
weren’t 0
the 0
actions 0
of 0
a 1
“tiny 1
minority 1
of 1
extremists,” 1
abhorred 1
by 1
the 1
vast 1
majority 1
of 1
peaceful 1
Muslims 1
for 1
“hijacking” 1
their 1
religion. 1

This 0
was, 0
for 0
fourteen 0
centuries, 0
mainstream, 0
normative 0
Islam, 0
carried 0
forth 0
by 0
the 0
primary 0
authorities 0
in 0
the 0
Islamic 0
world 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
shows 0
from 0
the 0
accounts 0
of 0
eyewitnesses 0
and 0
contemporary 0
chroniclers 0
through 0
the 0
ages 0
that 0
in 0
every 0
age 0
and 0
in 0
every 0
place 0
where 0
there 0
were 0
Muslims, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
believed 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
responsibility 0
given 0
to 0
them 0
by 0
Allah 0
to 0
wage 0
war 0
against 0
and 0
subjugate 0
unbelievers 0
under 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
Islamic 0
law. 0

And 0
so 0
it 0
is 0
today: 0
Said 0
Khecharem 0
has 0
enunciated 0
that 0
responsibility 0
more 0
clearly 0
and 0
directly 0
than 0
most 0
Muslim 0
spokesmen 0
do 0
these 0
days, 0
but 0
he 0
is 0
by 0
no 0
means 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
who 0
believes 0
that 0
it 0
exists. 0

What 0
is 0
noteworthy 0
also 0
about 0
The 0
History 0
of 0
Jihad 0
is 0
something 0
that 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
contain. 0

As 0
the 0
jihadis 0
move 0
against 0
non-Muslim 0
states 0
without 0
any 0
letup, 0
pause, 0
period 0
of 0
coexistence, 0
period 0
of 0
tolerance, 0
reformation, 0
or 0
reconsideration, 0
there 0
never 0
appears 0
any 0
force 0
of 0
Muslims 0
to 0
oppose 0
them. 0

While 0
it 0
is 0
undoubtedly 0
true 0
that 0
not 0
all 0
Muslims 0
in 0
any 0
given 0
age 0
have 0
ever 0
waged 0
jihad, 0
there 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
in 0
Islamic 0
history 0
an 0
Islamic 0
entity 0
or 0
organization 0
that 0
was 0
opposed 0
to 0
waging 0
jihad 0
and 0
dedicated 0
to 0
stopping 0
those 0
who 0
were 0
waging 0
it. 0

So 0
it 0
is 0
today. 0

Islamic 0
groups 0
in 0
the 0
West 0
issue 0
pro-forma 0
condemnations 0
after 0
every 0
jihad 0
terror 0
attack, 0
but 0
are 0
doing 0
little 0
or 0
nothing 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
next 0
one. 0

There 1
is 1
still 1
no 1
mosque 1
or 1
Islamic 1
school 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
that 1
teaches 1
young 1
Muslims 1
why 1
they 1
should 1
reject 1
the 1
understanding 1
of 1
Islam 1
taught 1
by 1
al-Qaeda, 1
ISIS, 1
and 1
other 1
jihad 1
terror 1
groups. 1

Meanwhile, 0
Said 0
Khecharem 0
and 0
other 0
Islamic 0
spokesmen 0
openly 0
call 0
for 0
Muslims 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
jihad 0
conquest. 0

Western 0
authorities 0
should 0
be 0
pondering 0
his 0
words, 0
and 0
their 0
implications, 0
very 0
carefully. 0

Instead, 0
if 0
they 0
have 0
taken 0
any 0
notice 0
of 0
him 0
at 0
all, 0
which 0
is 0
unlikely, 0
they 0
have 0
dismissed 0
him 0
as 0
an 1
“extremist.” 1

They 1
have 1
yet 1
to 1
come 1
to 1
grips 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
“extremism” 1
is 1
and 1
always 1
has 1
been 1
so 1
distressingly 1
widespread 1
in 1
Muslim 1
communities. 1

But 1
they 1
will. 1

Over 0
600 0

An 0
outbreak 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
is 0
spreading 0
at 0
an 0
unprecedented 1
rate. 0

With 0
the 0
ease 0
of 0
spreading 0
the 0
plague, 0
the 1
likelihood 1
that 1
this 1
disease 1
will 1
move 1
to 1
other 1
more 1
densely 1
populated 1
regions 1
of 1
the 1
planet 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
huge 1
concern 1
for 1
many. 1

So 0
far, 0
the 0
plague 0
has 0
claimed 0
57 0
lives 0
and 0
infected 0
more 0
than 0
680 0
others. 0

These 0
figures 0
are 0
from 0
October 0
12, 0
however, 0
and 0
the 0
disease 0
is 0
spreading 0
rapidly. 0

An 0
estimated 0
329 0
of 0
these 0
cases 0
and 0
25 0
of 0
the 0
deaths 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
capital 0
city 0
of 0
Antananarivo. 0

Of 0
the 0
684 0
cases 0
reported 0
as 0
of 0
October 0
12, 0
474 0
were 0
the 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
156 0
bubonic 0
and 0
1 0
septicemic 0
plague. 0

A 0
further 0
54 0
were 0
unspecified, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization. 0

Of 0
Madagascar’s 0
114 0
districts, 0
35 0
have 0
reported 0
cases 0
of 0
plague, 0
including 0
at 0
least 0
10 0
cities. 0

Plague 0
is 0
caused 0
by 0
infection 0
with 0
the 0
bacterium 0
Yersinia 0
pestis 0
and 0
is 0
typically 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
bite 0
of 0
infected 0
fleas, 0
frequently 0
carried 0
by 0
rats. 0

The 0
bacteria 0
will 0
eventually 0
end 0
up 0
causing 0
the 0
often 0
fatal 0
plague. 0

Symptoms 0
can 0
include 0
painful, 0
swollen 0
lymph 0
nodes, 0
called 0
buboes, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
fever, 0
chills, 0
and 0
coughing. 0

Pneumonic 0
plague 0
is 0
more 0
virulent 0
or 0
damaging 0
and 0
is 0
an 0
advanced 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
disease 0
characterized 0
by 0
a 0
severe 0
lung 0
infection. 0

The 0
infection 0
can 0
be 0
transmitted 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person 0
via 0
airborne 0
droplets 0
from 0
coughing 0
or 0
sneezing. 0

The 0
incubation 0
period 0
is 0
extremely 1
short 0
too, 0
and 0
an 0
infected 0
person 0
may 0
die 0
within 0
12 0
to 0
24 0
hours 0
of 0
contracting 0
the 0
bacteria 0
making 1
cures 1
in 1
underdeveloped 1
regions 1
of 1
the 1
globe 1
difficult 1
at 1
best. 1

According 0
to 0
CNN, 0
the 0
cases 0
were 0
reported 0
by 0
both 0
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
(WHO) 0
and 0
the 0
National 0
Bureau 0
for 0
Risk 0
and 0
Disaster 0
Management 0
(BNGRC) 0
in 0
Madagascar. 0

They 0
include 0
probable 0
and 0
suspected 0
cases 0
as 0
well 0
those 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
confirmed 0
by 0
laboratory 0
tests. 0

And 0
while 0
the 0
country 0
experiences 0
regular 0
outbreaks, 0
with 0
an 0
estimated 0
400 0
cases 0
of 0
plague 0
each 0
year, 0
this 0
time 0
things 0
are 0
very 0
different, 0
experts 0
warn. 0

This 0
year, 0
health 0
officials 0
report 0
the 0
infections 0
started 0
much 0
earlier 0
than 0
usual, 0
and 0
they’re 0
occurring 0
in 0
new 0
areas, 0
including 0
urban 0
settings. 0

They’ve 0
also 0
seen 0
an 0
unexpected 0
number 0
of 0
cases 0
of 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
which 0
transmits 0
more 0
easily 0
from 0
person 0
to 0
person. 0

Historically 0
dubbed 0
the 0
“black 1
death” 1
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
has 0
been 0
responsible 0
for 0
several 0
worldwide 0
pandemics 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

Early 0
detection 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
is 0
key 0
since 0
both 0
forms 0
of 0
it 0
can 0
be 0
cured 0
with 0
antibiotics. 0

But, 0
occasionally 0
there 0
can 0
be 0
cases 0
of 0
septicemic 0
plague, 0
where 0
the 0
infection 0
has 0
spread 0
to 0
a 0
person’s 0
bloodstream 0
and 0
can 0
cause 0
bleeding 0
and 0
necrosis 0
of 0
tissue, 0
turning 0
it 0
black. 0

Internationally, 0
this 0
outbreak 0
is 0
also 0
being 0
taken 0
seriously. 0

WHO 0
delivered 0
more 0
than 0
1.2 0
million 0
doses 0
of 0
antibiotics 0
and 0
released 0
$1.5 0
million 0
in 0
emergency 0
funds 0
earlier 0
this 0

will 0
likely 0
enter 0
a 0
cooldown 0

as 0
soon 0
as 0
2050, 0
but 0
the 0
phase 0
has 0
almost 0
no 0
effect 0
on 0

Physicist 0
Dan 0
Lubin 0
at 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
California 0
San 0
Diego 0
and 0
two 0
of 0
his 0
colleges 0
managed 0
to 0
collect 0
and 0
observe 0
relevant 0
data 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
20 0
years 0
and 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
conclusion 0
that 0
the 0
giant 0
burning 0
ball 0
of 0
gas 0
in 0
our 0
planetary 0
system 0
might 0
enter 0
a 0
“grand 0
minimum” 0
period 0
of 0
decreased 0
ultraviolet 0
radiation 0
that 0
would 0
last 0
for 0
some 0
11 0
years 0
by 0
mid-century. 0

“The 0
cooldown… 0
[is] 0
a 0
periodic 0
event 0
during 0
which 0
the 0
Sun’s 0
magnetism 0
diminishes, 0
sunspots 0
form 0
infrequently, 0
and 0
less 0
ultraviolet 0
radiation 0
(UV) 0
makes 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
surface 0
of 0
the 0
planet,” 0
researchers 0
noted 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
earlier 0
this 0
week, 0
adding 0
that 0
“the 0
event 0
is 0
triggered 0
at 0
irregular 0
intervals 0
by 0
random 0
fluctuations 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
Sun’s 0
magnetic 0
field.” 0

The 0
study, 0
whose 0
results 0
were 0
published 0
in 0
The 0
Astrophysical 0
Journal 0
Letters, 0
said 0
the 0
Sun 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
6.9 0
percent 0
cooler 0
than 0
its 0
usual 0
lowest 0
amount 0
of 0
activity 0
in 0
the 0
grand 0
minimum. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
researchers, 0
the 0
cooldown 0
phase 0
could 0
echo 0
those 0
experienced 0
in 0
Europe 0
in 0
the 0
mid-17th 0
century, 0
called 0
the 0
“Maunder 0
Minimum,” 0
or 0
the 0
prolonged 0
sunspot 0
minimum, 0
during 0
which 0
temperatures 0
were 0
low 0
enough 0
to 0
cause 0
London's 0
River 0
Thames 0
to 0
freeze 0
over 0
on 0
a 0
regular 0
basis 0
and 0
to 0
freeze 0
the 0
Baltic 0
Sea 0
to 0
such 0
an 0
extent 0
that 0
Swedish 0
troops 0
were 0
able 0
to 0
invade 0
Denmark 0
in 0
1658 0
on 0
foot 0
by 0
marching 0
across 0
the 0
sea 0
ice. 0

However, 0
scientists 0
warned 0
that 0
it 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
assumed 0
that 0
the 0
ultra-cooling 0
of 0
the 0
sun 0
would 0
potentially 0
prevent 0
the 0
negative 0
effects 0
of 0
global 0
warming. 0

“The 0
cooling 0
effect 0
of 0
a 0
grand 0
minimum 0
is 0
only 0
a 0
fraction 0
of 0
the 0
warming 0
effect 0
caused 0
by 0
the 0
increasing 0
concentration 0
of 0
carbon 0
dioxide 0
in 0
the 0
atmosphere,” 0
they 0
said, 0
adding, 0
“After 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
years 0
of 0
CO2 0
levels 0
never 0
exceeding 0
300 0
parts 0
per 0
million 0
in 0
air, 0
the 0
concentration 0
of 0
the 0
greenhouse 0
gas 0
is 0
now 0
over 0
400 0
parts 0
per 0
million, 0
continuing 0
a 0
rise 0
that 0
began 0
with 0
the 0
Industrial 0
Revolution.” 0

The 0
study 0
estimated 0
that 0
the 0
Sun’s 0
mid-century 0
cooldown 0
would 0
probably 0
only 0
result 0
in 0
cooling 0
the 0
Earth 0
by 0
some 0
0.25 0
percent 0
between 0
2020 0
and 0
2070. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
the 0
temperature 0
at 0
the 0
surface 0
of 0
our 0
cosmic 0
home 0
would 0
decrease 0
by 0
up 0
to 0
several 0
tenths 0
of 0
a 0
degree 0
Celsius, 0
which 0
is 0
not 0
sufficient 0
to 0
stop 0
global 0
warming, 0
but 0
it 0
could 0
at 0
least 0
soften 0
its 0
effects 0
in 0
part. 0

“Now 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
benchmark 0
from 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
perform 0
better 0

We 0
can 0
therefore 0
have 0
a 0
better 0
idea 0
of 0
how 0
changes 0
in 0
solar 0

Powell, 0
who 0
returned 0

role 0
after 0
leaving 0
her 0
job 0
as 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
deputy 0
national 0
security 0
adviser, 0
is 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
strongly 0
considering 0
the 0
job 0
but 0
also 0
weighing 0
family 0
concerns. 0

Powell 0
already 0
lives 0
in 0
New 0
York, 0
where 0
the 0
U.N. 0
is 0
based, 0
but 0
has 0
young 0

and 0
left 0
the 0

She 0
is 0
also 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
happy 0
in 0
her 0
job 0
at 0
Goldman. 0

Born 0
in 0

and 0
raised 0
in 0
the 0
United 0

Powell 0
is 0
well 0
liked 0

as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
president’s 0
daughter 0
Ivanka 0
and 0
son-in-law, 0
Jared 0

But 0
she 0
is 0
already 0
coming 0
under 0
criticism 0
from 0
some 0
conservatives 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
who 0
maintain 0
that 0
Powell 0
is 0
a 0
“globalist” 0
not 0
closely 0
enough 0
aligned 0
with 0
Trump’s 0
“America 1
first” 1
approach 0
to 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

Trump 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
described 0
Powell 0
as 0
a 0
“person 0
I 0
would 0
consider” 0
when 0
asked 0
about 0
her 0
possible 0
nomination. 0

“She 0
is 0
under 0
consideration. 0

We 0
have, 0
actually, 0
many 0
names,” 0
he 0
said. 0

However, 0
according 0
to 0
Bloomberg, 0
Powell 0
isn't 0
interested 0
in 0
the 0
position. 0

firm 0
to 0
rejoin 0
the 0

as 0

to 0
two 0
people 0
familiar 0

President 0
Donald 0

announced 0
her 0

on 0

the 0
people 0
said. 0

He 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
he’s 0
interested 0
in 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
appointing 0
Powell 0
to 0
the 0

clearly 0
opposed 0

Back 0

resigned 0

of 0
Deputy 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0

under 0
Islamic 0
apologist 0
H. 0
R. 0
McMaster, 0
whose 0
failed 0
views 0
she 0
shared. 0

McMaster 0
subscribed 0
to 0
the 0

view 0
that 0

nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0

numerous 0
Islamic 0
texts 0
and 0
teachings 0
that 0
incite 0
Muslims 0
to 0
wage 0
war 0
against 0
unbelievers. 0

McMaster 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
claim 0
that 0
devout 0
jihadis 0
were 0
“irreligious.” 0
McMaster 0
forced 0
out 0
superb 0
K.T. 0

McFarland 0
from 0
her 0
role 0

Again, 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
asked 1
this 1
before, 1
how 1
do 1
you 1
fight 1
the 1
Deep 1
State 1
by 1
putting 1
Deep 1
State 1
operatives 1
in 1
these 1
positions? 1

How 1
do 1
you 1
drain 1
the 1
swamp 1
by 1
adding 1
to 1
it? 1

The 0
answer 0
is 0
clear: 0
You 0
don't. 0

This 0
would 0
actually 0
be 0
the 0
perfect 0
time 0
for 0
Trump 0
not 0
to 0
appoint 0
an 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
and 0
call 0
for 0
the 0
US 0
to 0
exit 0
the 0
anti-American 1
organization 0
and 0
demand 0
Congress 0
stop 0
funding 0
it 0
and 0
evict 0
the 0
UN 0
from 0
US 0
soil, 0
but 0
I'm 0
not 0
holding 0
my 0
breath. 0

Has 0
Trump 0
Opened 1
the 1
Door? 1

Sagacious 1
gun 1
owners 1
have 0
always 0
known 0
that 0
the 0
ultimate 0
goal 0
of 0
gun 1
control 1
extremists 1
such 0
as 0
Chuck 0
Schumer, 0
Nancy 0
Pelosi, 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein, 0
et 0
al., 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
gun 0
confiscation. 0

The 0
plan 0
is 0
not 0
to 0
“control” 0
the 0
private 0
ownership 0
of 0
firearms; 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
PROHIBIT 0
the 0
private 0
ownership 0
of 0
firearms. 0

Enacting 0
ever-encroaching 1
gun 0
control 0
laws 0
is 0
simply 0
an 0
incremental 0
means 0
to 0
the 0
ultimate 0
end 0
of 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
and 0
prohibition. 0

Donald 0
Trump 0
was 0
elected 0
on 0
the 0
promise 0
of 0
protecting 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
(among 0
other 0
things). 0

Instead, 0
he 0
has 0
become 0
the 0
poster 0
boy 0
for 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
egregious 1
gun 1
control 1
machinations 1
of 1
all: 1
gun 1
confiscation. 1

As 0
I 0
reported 0
in 0
this 0
column 0
last 0
week, 0
in 0
a 0
bipartisan 0
meeting 0
with 0
congressmen 0
and 0
senators 0
recently, 0
President 0
Trump 0
“voiced 0
support 0
for 0
confiscating 0
guns 0
from 0
certain 0
individuals 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
dangerous, 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
violates 0
due 0
process 0
rights. 0

“‘I 0
like 0
taking 0
the 0
guns 0
early, 0
like 0
in 0
this 0
crazy 0
man’s 0
case 0
that 0
just 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Florida 0
… 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
court 0
would 0
have 0
taken 0
a 0
long 0
time,’ 0
Trump 0
said 0
at 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
lawmakers 0
on 0
school 0
safety 0
and 0
gun 0
violence. 0

“‘Take 1
the 1
guns 1
first, 1
go 1
through 1
due 1
process 1
second,’ 1
Trump 0
said. 0

“Trump 0
was 0
responding 0
to 0
comments 0
from 0
Vice 0
President 0
Pence 0
that 0
families 0
and 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
should 0
have 0
more 0
tools 0
to 0
report 0
potentially 0
dangerous 0
individuals 0
with 0
weapons. 0

“‘Allow 0
due 0
process 0
so 0
no 0
one’s 0
rights 0
are 0
trampled, 1
but 0
the 0
ability 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
court, 0
obtain 0
an 0
order 0
and 0
then 0
collect 0
not 0
only 0
the 0
firearms 0
but 0
any 0
weapons,’ 0
Pence 0
said. 0

“‘Or, 0
Mike, 0
take 0
the 0
firearms 0
first, 0
and 0
then 0
go 0
to 0
court,’ 0
Trump 0
responded.” 0

Well, 0
Trump’s 0
statements 0
are 0
now 0
the 0
rallying 1
cry 1
for 0
gun 0
grabbers 0
all 0
over 0
America 0
to 0
enact 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
laws. 0

So 0
far, 0
five 0
states 0
have 0
passed 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws 0
that 0
allow 0
police 0
agencies 0
to 0

from 0
someone 0
deemed 0
to 0

This 0

from 0
Seattle:Doubtless, 0
many 0
other 0
states 0
are 0
also 0
considering 0
passing 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws. 0

“The 0

The 0
volume 0
of 0
complaints 0
convinced 0
Seattle 0

to 0
seek 0
an 0
extreme 0
risk 0
protection 0

“The 0
confiscations 0
only 0
last 0
a 0
year, 0
although 0
they 0
can 0
be 0
renewed.” 0

See 0
the 0
report 0
here: 0

Seattle 0
Police 0
First 0
In 0
State 0
To 0
Seize 0
Gun 0
Under 0
Mental 0
Health 0
Law 0

A 0
few 0
observations 0
are 0
in 0
order 0
here: 0

First, 1
the 1
open 1
carry 1
of 1
a 1
firearm 1
is 1
LEGAL 1
in 1
the 1
area 1
where 1
this 1
took 1
place. 1

So, 1
the 1
fellow 1
was 1
violating 1
NO 1
gun 1
laws 1
whatsoever. 1

Plus, 0
he 0
never 0
removed 0
the 0
pistol 0
from 0
its 0
holster 0
or 0
brandished 0
it 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

Secondly, 0
the 0
man 0
was 0
“known” 0
to 0
nearby 0
bars 0
and 0
restaurants 0
near 0
his 0
place 0
of 0
residence. 0

That 0
means 0
nothing. 0

Known 0
for 0
what? 0

The 0
report 0
doesn’t 0
even 0
say 0
the 0
man 0
was 0
known 0
for 0
acting 0
weirdly 0
or 0
strangely. 0

It 0
just 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
“known.” 0
And 0
even 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
act 0
weirdly 0
or 0
strangely, 0
if 0
we 0
denied 0
constitutional 0
rights 0
to 0
everyone 0
in 0
that 0
category, 0
a 0
majority 0
of 0
Americans 0
would 0
have 0
no 0
rights, 0
and 1
ALL 1
of 1
Congress 1
would 1
have 1
no 1
rights. 1

Thirdly, 1
what 1
does 1
“volume 1
of 1
complaints” 1
mean? 1

How 1
many 1
complaints 1
were 1
received 1
over 1
a 1
YEAR’S 1
time? 1

Two? 1

Five? 1

Ten? 1

People 1
complaining 1
about 1
other 1
people 1
happens 1
all 1
of 1
the 1
time. 1

Plus, 0
if 0
complaints 0
had 0
been 0
received 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
an 0
entire 0
year 0
and 0
police 0
just 0
now 0
decided 0
to 0
act, 0
the 0
man 0
must 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
considered 0
much 0
of 0
a 0
threat. 0

Fourthly, 0
there 0
was 0
NO 1
report 0
of 0
the 0
man 0
“exhibiting 0
violent 0
behavior,” 0
as 0
the 0
police 0
sergeant 0
claims. 0

The 0
report 0
says 0
“he 0
had 0
been 0
intimidating 0
people.” 0
How? 0

No 0
specifics 0
except 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
was 0
“staring” 0
at 0
people. 0

Wow! 1

Run 1
for 1
your 1
lives! 1

Fifthly, 1
a 1
U.S. 1
citizen 1
who 1
has 1
committed 1
NO 1
CRIME 1
is 1
denied 1
his 1
Natural 1
right 1
of 1
self-defense 1
for 1
a 1
whole 1
year. 1

And 1
the 1
media 1
report 1
says 1
the 1
confiscations 1
“only” 1
last 1
a 1
year, 1
with 1
the 1
caveat 1
that 1
they 1
may 1
be 1
extended. 1

Indeed. 1

They 1
could 1
and 1
very 1
likely 1
will 1
be 1
extended 1
indefinitely. 1

How 1
many 1
defenseless 1
(unarmed) 1
people 1
are 1
robbed, 1
assaulted, 1
accosted, 1
beaten 1
up, 1
raped, 1
wounded, 1
paralyzed, 1
or 1
killed 1
in 1
a 1
year’s 1
time? 1

It 0
seems 0
many 0
politicians 0
(and 0
many 0
police 0
officers 0
themselves) 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
content 0
until 0
every 0
American 0
citizen 0
is 0
totally 0
defenseless 0
and 0
unable 0
to 0
protect 0
him 0
or 0
herself. 0

I 0
tell 0
you 0
this 0
with 0
all 0
seriousness: 0
At 1
some 1
point, 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
will 1
be 1
forced 1
to 1
view 1
these 1
governmental 1
attacks 1
against 1
our 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
liberties 1
as 1
a 1
declaration 1
of 1
war. 1

Sixthly, 0
the 0
man 0
quoted 0
in 0
the 0
news 0
story 0
who 0
had 0
complained 0
about 0
the 0
armed 0
fellow 0
did 0
so 0
because 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
didn’t 0
like 0
the 0
sight 0
of 0
the 0
man 0
carrying 0
a 0
firearm, 0
as 0
it 0
made 0
him 0
“afraid.” 0

SO 1
WHAT? 1

That 0
the 0
mere 0
sight 0
of 0
a 0
law-abiding 0
citizen 0
openly 0
carrying 0
a 0
sidearm 0
would 0
make 0
someone 0
“afraid” 0
is 0
not 0
sufficient 0
reason 0
to 0
deny 0
the 0
citizen 0
his 0
constitutional 0
right 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
“bear” 0
arms. 0

This 1
“I’m 1
offended” 1
or 1
“his 1
gun 1
scares 1
me” 1
complaint 1
is 1
nothing 1
but 1
cover 1
for 1
little 1
Nazis 1
to 1
try 1
and 1
deny 1
another 1
person 1
their 1
Natural, 1
God-given 1
liberty. 1

But 0
under 0
this 0
new 0
“red 0
flag” 0
law 0
in 0
Washington 0
State, 0
police 0
are 0
now 0
able 0
to 0
confiscate 0
a 0
person’s 0
firearm 0
without 0
the 0
person 0
committing 0
ANY 1
crime—or 0
even 0
threatening 0
to 0
commit 0
a 0
crime. 0

Even 0
when 0
police 0
forced 0
the 0
man 0
to 0
surrender 0
his 0
firearm, 0
the 0
man 0
made 0
no 0
threatening 0
gesture 0
toward 0
the 0
officers. 0

Gun 0
confiscation 0
has 0
started 0
in 0
America—and 0
President 1
Trump’s 1
Stalinist 1
statements 1
about 1
taking 1
guns 1
first 1
and 1
worrying 1
about 1
due 1
process 1
later 1
is 1
the 1
banner 1
under 1
which 1
this 1
is 1
happening. 1

When 0
Trump 0
promised 0
to 0
add 0
“mental 0
health” 0
regulations 0
to 0
gun 0
purchases 0
and 0
ownership, 0
he 1
opened 1
Pandora’s 1
Box. 1

I 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
“mental 0
health” 0
trap 0
in 0
more 0
detail 0
in 0
this 0
column: 0

Trump 0
Set 0
To 0
Enact 0
More 0
Gun 0
Control 0

“Mental 0
health” 0
regulations 0
for 0
gun 0
ownership 0
is 0
what 0
extremist 0
gun 0
grabbers 0
Schumer, 0
Pelosi, 0
Feinstein, 0
et 0
al., 0
have 0
been 0
trying 0
to 0
accomplish 0
for 0
decades. 0

Now, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
“pro-gun” 0
Republican 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
who 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
making 0
it 0
happen. 0

Kris 0
Kobach 0
is 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
of 0
Kansas. 0

He 0
is 0
a 0
former 0
professor 0
of 0
constitutional 0
law 0
at 0
UMKC 0
Law 0
School. 0

He 0
wrote 0
an 0
excellent 0
analysis 0
of 0
the 0
constitutional 0
violations 0
of 0
these 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws: 0

The 0
seizure 0
of 0
guns 0
without 0
any 0
hearing 0
at 0
all. 0

The 0
laws 0
all 0
contain 0
an 0
“ex 0
parte” 0
provision 0
that 0
allows 0
the 0
state 0
to 0
temporarily 0
seize 0
a 0
person’s 0
guns 0
without 0
even 0
notifying 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
or 0
giving 0
him 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
be 0
heard. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
quintessential 0
denial 0
of 0
due 0
process. 0

The 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
makes 0
clear 0
that 0
a 0
person 0
cannot 0
be 0
denied 0
of 0
liberty 0
(to 0
exercise 0
one’s 0
constitutional 0
right 0
to 0
bear 0
arms) 0
without 0
due 0
process 0
of 0
law. 0

This 0
confiscation 0
is 0
“temporary,” 0
but 0
it 0
can 0
easily 0
lead 0
to 0
long-term 0
or 0
permanent 0
confiscation. 0

Based 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
one 0
unrelated 0
person. 0

The 0
confiscation 0
order 0
can 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
only 0
one 0
person 0
claiming 0
that 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
poses 0
a 0
risk 0
to 0
the 0
safety 0
of 0
himself 0
or 0
others. 0

The 0
law 0
deceptively 1
says 1
that 0
it 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
a 0
“family 0
member.” 0
[Most 0
of 0
the 0
“red 0
flag” 0
laws, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
Washington 0
State, 0
do 0
not 0
limit 0
who 0
can 0
claim 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
poses 0
a 0
risk 0
to 0
the 0
safety 0
of 0
himself 0
or 0
others 0
to 0
family 0
members.] 0

But 0
“family 0
member” 0
is 0
defined 0
to 0
include 0
“former 0
dating 0
partners” 0
and 0
anyone 0
who 0
has 0
ever 0
lived 0
with 0
the 0
defendant. 0

So 0
a 0
jilted 0
former 0
boyfriend 0
or 0
girlfriend, 0
or 0
even 0
a 0
roommate 0
from 0
years 0
ago, 0
could 0
easily 0
set 0
in 0
motion 0
the 0
disarming 0
of 0
a 0
lawful 0
gun 0
owner. 0

Using 0
a 0
very 0
low 0
standard 0
of 0
proof. 0

The 0
standard 0
for 0
obtaining 0
an 0
ex 0
parte 0
order 0
against 0
a 0
gun 0
owner 0
is 0
absurdly 1
low 1
– 0
one 0
need 0
only 0
show 0
“reasonable 0
cause” 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
person 0
may 0
pose 0
a 0
risk. 0

That’s 0
even 0
lower 0
than 0
the 0
“probable 0
cause” 0
standard 0
for 0
obtaining 0
a 0
search 0
warrant. 0

In 0
addition, 0
the 0
judge 0
is 0
forced 0
to 0
rush 0
his 0
decision 0
and 0
issue 0
the 0
confiscation 0
order 0
on 0
the 0
same 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
ex 0
parte 0
hearing. 0

Within 0
two 0
weeks 0
of 0
the 0
ex 0
parte 0
hearing, 0
a 0
hearing 0
with 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
present 0
must 0
occur; 0
the 0
purpose 0
is 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
a 0
long-term 0
confiscation 0
order. 0

But 0
even 0
at 0
that 0
hearing, 0
the 0
standard 0
of 0
proof 0
is 0
far 0
below 0
the 0
“beyond 0
a 0
reasonable 0
doubt” 0
standard 0
used 0
in 0
criminal 0
trials. 0

Rather, 0
it 0
need 0
only 0
be 0
shown 0
by 0
“a 0
preponderance 0
of 0
evidence” 0
that 0
the 0
person 0
poses 0
a 0
risk 0
of 0
injury 0
to 0
self 0
or 0
others. 0

What 0
kind 0
of 0
evidence? 0

Things 0
like 0
the 0
“reckless 0
storage” 0
of 0
firearms 0
and 0
drinking 0
habits 0
can 0
be 0
considered. 0

If 1
you 1
keep 1
a 1
handgun 1
in 1
the 1
bedside 1
table 1
and 1
drink 1
beer 1
regularly, 1
you 1
may 1
[be] 1
in 1
trouble. 1

Shifting 0
the 0
burden 0
of 0
proof 0
to 0
the 0
gun 0
owner. 0

The 0
long-term 0
confiscation 0
order 0
lasts 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
year, 0
but 0
may 0
be 0
renewed 0
indefinitely. 0

Once 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
place, 0
it 0
becomes 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
remove. 0

To 0
have 0
the 0
confiscation 0
order 0
lifted, 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0
must 0
provehe 0
does 0
not 0
pose 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
himself 0
or 0
others. 0

Proving 1
a 1
negative 1
is 1
nearly 1
impossible. 1

Adding 1
insult 1
to 1
injury, 1
the 0
bill 0
even 0
authorizes 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
to 0
charge 0
the 0
gun 0
owner 0

After 0
the 0
Parkland 0
school 0
shooting, 0
had 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
simply 0
used 0
his 0
bully 1
pulpit 1
to 0
promote 0
arming 0
teachers 0
and 0
school 0
employees 0
as 0
a 0

and 0
defense 0
against 0
these 0
school 0
shootings 0
without 0
calling 0
for 0
more 0

control, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
HUGE 1
boost 0
for 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
in 0
general 0
and 0
school 0
safety 0
in 0
particular. 0

Instead, 0
Trump 0
fell 0
in 0
with 0
anti-Second 0
Amendment 0
liberals 0
and 0
started 0
calling 0
for 0
more 0
gun 0
control, 0
adding 0
“mental 0
health” 0
restrictions 0
to 0
gun 0
purchases 0
and 0
making 1
his 1
stupid 1
Stalinist 1
statements 1
about 1
taking 1
guns 1
first 1
and 1
worrying 1
about 1
due 1
process 1
later. 1

As 0
a 0
result, 0
anti-gun 0
liberals 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
country 0
are 0
using 0
Trump’s 0
own 0
words 0
and 0
proposed 0
gun 0
control 0
policies 0
as 0
a 0
rallying 1
cry 1
to 0
enact 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
laws. 0

As 0
it 0
stands 0
right 0
now, 0
Donald 1
Trump 1
has 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
for 1
more 1
damage 1
being 1
done 1
to 1
the 1
Second 1
Amendment 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
president, 1
Democrat 1
or 1
Republican, 1
in 1
our 1
lifetime. 1

Freedomists 0
in 0
the 0
50 0
states 0
had 0
better 0
keep 0
a 0
close 0
eye 0
on 0
their 0
State 0
legislatures 0
this 0
year 0
and 0
next, 0
because, 0
thanks 0
to 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
agenda 0
in 0
virtually 0
every 0
single 0
State 0
in 0
the 0
country. 0

And 0
while 0
you 0
are 0
at 0
it, 0
don’t 0
overlook 0
the 0
federal 0
Congress. 0

No 0
wonder 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
looked 0
so 1
deliriously 1
(and 1
devilishly) 1
happy 0
when 0
Trump 0
uttered 1
his 1
stupid 1
comment 1
about 0
gun 0
confiscation 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
bring 0
an 0
assault 0
weapons 0
ban 0
(Feinstein’s 0
bill) 0
into 0
proposed 0
gun 0

But 1
if 1
you 1
are 1
a 1
freedom-loving 1
American 1
who 0
values 0
your 0
liberties 0
and 0
the 0
God-given 0
right 0
to 0
defend 0
them, 0
happy 0
is 0
NOT 1
what 0
you 0
should 0
be 0
feeling 0
right 0
now. 0

You 0
should 0
be 0
OUTRAGED 0
at 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
and 0
you 0
should 0
be 0
absolutely 0
determined 0
to 0
be 0
ever 0
vigilant 0
against 0
ANY 1
attempt 0
from 0
Democrats 0
or 0
Republicans 0
from 0
federal, 0
State, 0
or 0
municipal 0
government 0
to 0
enact 0
further 0
restrictions 0
against 0
your 0
right 0
to 0
keep 0
and 0
bear 0
arms—because 0
Trump 0
has 1
opened 1
the 1
door 1
not 0
only 0
for 0
more 0
gun 0
control 0
but 0
also 0
for 0
gun 0
confiscation. 0

P.S. 0

One 0
more 0
time 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
remind 0
readers 0
that 0
self-defense—including 0
defense 0
against 0
tyrannical 0
government—is 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
right 0
guaranteed 0
in 0
the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
to 0
our 0
Constitution; 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
duty 0
assigned 0
us 0
in 0
Nature 0
by 0
our 0
Creator. 0

For 0
anyone, 0
especially 0
a 0
Christian, 0
to 0
willingly 0
surrender 0
their 0
means 0
of 0
self-defense 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
a 0
crime 0
against 0
liberty; 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
sin 0
against 0
God. 0

I 0
urge 0
my 0
Christian 0
friends 0
(and 0
anyone 0
else) 0
to 0
read 0
the 0
book 0
my 0
constitutional 0
attorney 0
son 0
and 0
I 0
wrote 0
entitled 0
“To 0
Keep 0
or 0
Not 0
To 0
Keep: 0
Why 0
Christians 0
Should 0
Not 0
Give 0
Up 0
Their 0
Guns.” 0

Mark 0
it 0
down: 0
Any 0
law 0
demanding 0
the 0
citizenry 0
to 0
surrender 0
their 0
AR-15 0
rifles 0
would 0
be 0
unconstitutional, 0
unnatural, 0
and 0
unbiblical. 0

And 0
NO 1
Christian 0
or 0
other 0
free 0
man 0
should 0
ever 0
comply 0
with 0
such 0
a 0
law. 0

I 0
know 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
plethora 0
of 0
pastors 0
who 0
teach 0
that 0
Christians 0
ought 0
to 0
obey 0
the 0
government 0
should 0
it 0
outlaw 0
our 0
guns. 0

THEY 0
ARE 0
WRONG. 0

They 1
are 1
wrong 1
biblically, 1
constitutionally, 0
and 0
morally. 0

Our 0
book 0
shows 0
the 0
Natural 0
and 0
Biblical 0
duty 0
of 0
self-defense. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
of 0
another 0
book 0
like 0
it. 0

With 0
all 0
that 0
is 0
happening 0
today, 0
it 0
is 0
CRUCIAL 1
that 0
people 0
(especially 0
Christians) 0
become 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
truths 0
contained 0
in 0
this 0
book. 0

I 0
urge 0
you 0
to 0
order 0
one 0
for 0
yourself 0
and 0
one 0
(at 0
least) 0
for 0
your 0
friends 0
and 0
kinfolk. 0

not 0
immediately 0
respond 0
to 0
questions 0
about 0
the 0
findings, 0
the 0
Associated 0

The 0
US 0
reduced 0
its 0

in 0
Havana, 0
Cuba, 0
in 0
2017 0
after 0
its 0
personnel 0

their 0
families 0
reported 0
experiencing 0
a 0
range 0
of 0
health 1
issues. 1

Investigators 0
have 0
drawn 0
theories 0
including 0
that 0
were 0
targeted 0
by 0
sonic 1
attacks, 1
where 0
the 0
symptoms 0
included 0
dizziness, 0
headaches 0
and 0
vomiting. 0

The 0
attacks 1
can 0
sometimes 0
be 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
emitting 0
"infrasounds", 0
which 0
are 0
low 0
frequency 0
noises 0
that 0
can 0
affect 0
human 0

if 0
they 0

enough. 0

However, 0
Dr 0
Toby 0
Heys 0
told 0
the 0
New 0

in 0
2017 0
that 0
an 0
infrasound 0
attack 1
wouldn't 0
be 0
"very 0

a 0
"large 0

that 0

with 0
you 0
in 0
this 0
article 0
that 0
are 0
deeply 1

but 0
it 0
is 0
for 0
a 0
purpose. 0

The 0
status 0

is 0
not 0
acceptable 0
in 0
Washington, 0
and 1
once 1
people 1
truly 1
understand 1
how 1
deep 1
the 1
corruaption 1
runs 1
I 1
believe 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
get 1
motivated 1
to 1
finally 1
drain 1
the 1
swamp 1
once 1
and 1
for 1
all. 1

So 0
yes, 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
share 0
some 0
things 0
in 0
this 0
article 0
that 0
are 0
truly 1
disgusting, 1
but 0
the 0
goal 0
is 0
to 0
show 0
you 0
that 0
it 1
is 1
time 1
to 1
take 1
our 1
government 1
back 1
from 1
the 1
corrupt 1
career 1
politicians 1
that 1
are 1
completely 1
and 1
utterly 1
out 1
of 1

In 0
recent 0
days, 0
CNN 0
has 0
interviewed 0
dozens 0
of 0
people 0
that 0
worked 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill, 0
and 0
almost 0
every 0
single 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
had 0
stories 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
to 0
share… 0

CNN 0
spoke 0
with 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
lawmakers, 0
current 0
and 0
former 0
Hill 0
aides 0
and 0
political 0
veterans 0
who 0
have 0
worked 0
in 0
Congress, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
whom 0
spoke 0
anonymously 0
to 0
be 0
candid 0
and 0
avoid 0
potential 0
repercussions. 0

With 0
few 0
exceptions, 0
every 0
person 0
said 0
they 0
have 0
personally 0
experienced 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
on 0
the 0
Hill 0
or 0
know 0
of 0
others 0
who 0
have. 0

In 0
an 0
environment 0
with 0
“so 0
many 0
young 0
women,” 0
said 0
one 0
ex-House 0
aide, 0
the 1
men 1
“have 1
no 1
self-control.” 1
“Amongst 0
ourselves, 0
we 0
know,” 0
a 0
former 0
Senate 0
staffer 0
said 0
of 0
the 0
lawmakers 0
with 0
the 0
worst 0
reputations. 0

And 0
sometimes, 0
the 0
sexual 0
advances 0
from 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
or 0
senior 0
aides 0
are 0
reciprocated 0
in 0
the 0
hopes 0
of 0
advancing 0
one’s 0
career 0
— 0
what 0
one 0
political 0
veteran 0
bluntly 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
“sex 1
trade 1
on 1
Capitol 1
Hill.” 1

The 1
American 1
people 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
with 1
this 1
any 1
longer. 1

We 1
have 1
no 1
choice 1
but 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
our 1
government 1
because 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
is 1
laughing 1
at 1
us. 1

“In 0
fact 0
there 0
are 0
two 0

Republican 0
and 0
Democrat, 0
right 0
now, 0
who 0

— 0
who 0

Speier 0
said 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
harassers 0
has 0
propositioned 0
women 0
with 0
the 0
comment, 0
“Are 1
you 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
good 1
girl?” 1
Another 0
has 1
exposed 1
his 1

she 0
said, 0
and 0
some 0

have 0
had 0
“their 1

“All 0

They 0
want 0
the 0
system 0
fixed 0
and 0
the 0
perpetrators 0
held 0
accountable.” 0

And 0
Speier 0
was 0
the 0
one 0
that 0
revealed 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
15 0
million 0
dollars 0
have 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0

The 0
following 0
comes 0
from 0
Breitbart… 0

Rep. 0
Jackie 0
Speier 0
(D-CA) 0
told 0
MSNBC’s 0
Chuck 0
Todd 0
on 0
Meet 0
the 0
Press 0
Daily 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
has 0
paid 0
$15 0
million 0
to 0
alleged 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
by 0
its 0
own 0
members 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

“We 0
do 0
know 0
there 0
is 0
about 0
$15 0
million 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
House 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
harassers 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
ten 0
to 0
15 0
years,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“15 0
million 0
dollars 0
has 0
been 0
paid 0
out 0
over 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
claims,” 0
Todd 0
replied, 0
somewhat 0
shocked. 0

“So, 0
obviously 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
member 0
of 0
Congress.” 0

If 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
are 0
engaged 0
in 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
behavior, 0
why 0
don’t 0
the 0
American 0
people 0
know 0
about 0
it? 0

And 0
why 0
are 0
those 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
still 0
allowed 0
to 0
serve? 0

Representative 0
Barbara 0
Comstock 0
also 0
testified 0
on 0
Tuesday. 0

She 0
said 0
that 0
one 0
current 0
member 0
of 0
Congress 0
exposed 1
his 1
private 1
parts 1
to 1
a 1
female 1
staffer 1
when 0
she 0
delivered 0
papers 0
to 0
his 0
house… 0

Rep. 0
Barbara 0
Comstock 0
(R-Va.) 0
said 0
at 0
a 0
House 0
Administration 0
Committee 0
hearing 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
a 0
sitting 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Congress 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
a 0
young 0
female 0
staffer 0
who 0
delivered 0
papers 0
to 0
his 0
house–at 0
his 0
request. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
told 0
who 0
this 0
member 0
of 0
Congress 0
is 0
so 0
that 0
he 0
can 0
be 0
removed 0
from 0
Congress 0
immediately. 0

This 0
kind 0
of 0
behavior 0
is 0
not 0
acceptable 0
for 0
anyone 0
in 0
a 0
civilized 0
society 0
– 0
and 1
that 1
goes 1
double 1
for 1
someone 1
that 1
is 1
supposed 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
leaders 1
of 1
our 1
nation. 1

Here 0
are 0
the 0
exact 0
words 0
that 0
Comstock 0
used 0
as 0
she 0
described 0
this 0
incident… 0

This 0
member 0
asked 0
a 0
staffer 0
to 0
bring 0
them 0
over 0
some 0
materials, 0
to 0
their 0
residence. 0

And 0
the 0
young 0
staffer 0
— 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
young 0
woman 0
— 0
went 0
there 0
and 0
was 0
greeted 0
with 0
a 0
member 0
in 0
a 0
towel. 0

It 0
was 0
a 0
male, 0
who 0
then 0
invited 0
her 0
in. 0

And 0
at 0
that 0
point, 0
he 0
decided 0
to 0
expose 0
himself. 0

She 0
left, 0
and 0
then 0
she 0
quit 0
her 0
job. 0

She 1
left, 1
she 1
found 1
another 1
job. 1

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
behavior 0
is 0
not 0
just 0
limited 0
to 0
members 0
of 0
Congress. 0

According 0
to 0
an 0
ex-Secret 0
Service 0
agent, 0
Vice-President 0
Joe 0
Biden 0
was 0
regularly 0
engaged 0
in 0
“Weinstein-level” 1
predatory 1
behavior… 1

An 0
ex-Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
is 0
claiming 0
that 0
former 0
Vice 0
President 0
Joe 0
Biden 0
engaged 0
in 0
“Weinstein-level” 1
sexual 1
assault 1
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
walk 0
around 0
the 0
VP 0
residence 0
late 0
at 0
night 0
completely 1
naked. 1

According 0
to 0
Big 0
League 0
Politics’ 0
Cassandra 0
Fairbanks, 0
a 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
who 0
spoke 0
on 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity 0
revealed 0
that 0
Biden 0
“would 1
mess 1
with 1
every 1
single 1
woman 1
or 1
teen,” 1
and 0
that 0
a 0
Christmas 0
get-together 0
at 0
the 0
VP’s 0
house 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
canceled 0
“because 0
Biden 0
would 1
grope 1
all 1
of 1
our 1
wives 1
and 1
girlfriend’s 1
asses.” 1

In 0
fact, 0
things 0
were 0
so 0
bad 0
that 0
at 0
one 0
point 0
a 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
almost 0
got 0
into 0
a 0
fight 0
with 0
Biden. 0

Here 0
is 0
more 0
from 0
Paul 0
Joseph 0
Watson… 0

During 0
one 0
alleged 0
incident 0
in 0
2009, 0
Biden 0
cupped 0
the 0
breast 0
of 0
a 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent’s 0
girlfriend 0
during 0
a 0
photo, 0
prompting 0
the 0
agent 0
to 0
shove 0
Biden 0
and 0
almost 0
hit 0
him. 0

The 0
agent 0
was 0
subsequently 0
suspended 0
for 0
a 0
week, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
source. 0

Men 0
would 0
often 0
stand 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
female 0
agents 0
and 0
Navy 0
women 0
or 0
create 0
false 0
pretenses 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
leave 0
the 0
room 0
just 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
away 0
from 0
Biden, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
agent. 0

When 0
I 0
am 0
elected 0
to 0
Congress, 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
make 0
fighting 0
this 0
sort 0
of 0
predatory 0
behavior 0
a 0
top 0
priority. 0

We 1
are 1
supposed 1
to 1
serve 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
to 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
world, 1
and 1
instead, 1
we 1
have 1
become 1
a 1
bad 1
joke. 1

Those 1
that 1
have 1
been 1
engaging 1
in 1
this 1
sort 1
of 1
shameful 1
behavior 1
have 1
got 1
to 1
go 1
because 1
we 1
simply 1
are 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
put 1
up 1
with 1
it 1
anymore. 1

Stacey 0
Abrams 0
ended 0
her 0
run 0
for 0
Georgia 0
governor 0
on 0
Friday, 0
but 0
the 0
Democrat 0
said 0
she 0
would 0
not 0
concede 0
the 0
contest 0
to 0
Republican 0
Brian 0
Kemp 0
and 0
planned 0
to 0
launch 0
a 0
voting 0
rights 0
group 0
to 0
file 0
“major” 0
litigation 0
challenging 0
election 0
policies. 0

As 0
state 0
officials 0
prepare 0
to 0
certify 0
the 0
vote, 0
Abrams 0
acknowledged 0
the 0
law 0
“allows 0
no 0
further 0
viable 0
remedy” 0
to 0
extend 0
her 0
quest 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
nation’s 0
first 0
black 0
female 0
governor. 0

But 0
she 0
laced 0
her 0
speech 0
with 0
biting 0
criticism 0
of 0
Kemp, 0
who 0
she 0
accused 0
of 0
leveraging 0
his 0
role 0
as 0
the 0
state’s 0
top 0
elections 0
official 0
to 0
suppress 0
voters. 0

“I 0
will 0
not 0
concede,” 0
she 0
added, 0
“because 0
the 0
erosion 0
of 0
our 0
democracy 0
is 0
not 0
right.” 0

You 1
mean 1
like 1
having 1
a 1
sister 1
waiting 1
in 1
the 1
wings 1
of 1
any 1
campaign 1
lawsuits, 1
Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

What 1
about 1
invalid 1
provisional 1
ballots 1
getting 1
mixed 1
in 1
with 1
valid 1
ones? 1

Maybe 1
a 1
little 1
electronic 1
voter 1
manipulation, 1
Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

How 1
about 1
non-citizens 1
and 1
illegal 1

Ms. 1
Abrams? 1

Are 0
these 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
erosion 0
of 0
the 0

process? 0

Sure 0
they 0
are 0
and 0
they 0
appear 0
to 0
all 0
be 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
party 0
that 0
Stacey 0
Abrams 0
represents, 0
but 0
she's 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
that. 0

But 0
she 0
wasn't 0
going 0
to 0
concede. 0

Nope, 0
that 0
arrogant 0
wanna-be 0
first 0
female 0
governor 0
of 0
Georgia 0
simply 0
would 0
not 0
bow 0
out 0
gracefully. 0

“To 0
watch 0
an 0
elected 0
official 0
who 0
claims 0
to 0
represent 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
this 0
state 0
baldly 1
pin 1
his 1
hopes 1
for 0
election 0
on 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
the 0
people’s 0
democratic 0
right 0
to 0
vote 0
has 0
been 0
truly 0
appalling,” 0
Abrams 0
said. 0

“So, 0
let’s 0
be 0
clear," 0
she 0
continued. 0

"This 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
speech 0
of 0
concession. 0

Because 0
concession 0
means 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
an 0
action 0
is 0
right, 0
true 0
or 0
proper. 0

As 0
a 0
woman 0
of 0
conscience 0
and 0
faith, 0
I 0
cannot 0
concede 0
that. 0

But 0
my 0
assessment 0
is 0
the 0
law 0
currently 0
allows 0
no 0
further 0
viable 0
remedy.” 0

No, 0
concession 0
means 0
"a 0
thing 0
that 0
is 0
granted, 0
especially 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
demands; 0
a 0
thing 0
conceded." 0

Abrams 0
was 0
easily 0
defeated 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
votes. 0

She 0
was 0
the 0
one 0
trying 0
to 0
"find" 0
and 0
count 0
votes 0
remember? 0

She 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
claiming 0
there 0
was 0
cancellation 0
of 0
hundreds 0
of 0
thousands 0
of 0
voter 0
registrations. 0

Where 0
is 0
her 0
evidence? 0

She 0
has 0
none. 0

Stacey 0
Abrams 0
is 0
a 0
sore 0
loser 0
just 0
like 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
this 0
little 0

tantrum 0
she 0

as 0

I’ve 0

a 0
criminal 0
trial 0
involving 0
a 0
Muslim 0

at 0
Leeds 0
Crown 0

The 0
judge 0
also 0
put 0
a 0
gag 0
on 0
the 0
press 0
so 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
allowed 0
to 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
arrest, 0
and 0
many 0
reputable 0

Robinson 0
was 0
denied 0
due 0
process, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0

Robinson 0
has 0
been 0
at 0
the 0
forefront 0
of 0
exposing 0
the 0
criminal 0
elements 0
in 0
Islam. 0

Just 0
last 0
week 0
I 0
reported 0
on 0
his 0
previous 0
comments 0
about 0
being 0
incarcerated 0
earlier 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
a 0
plot 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
prison. 0

This 0
isn't 0
far-fetched. 0

In 0
March, 0
we 0
reported 0
on 0
Britain 0
First's 0
Paul 0
Golding 0
was 0
attacked 0
by 0
two 0
inmates 0
at 0
HMP 0
Elmley, 0
on 0
the 0
Isle 0
of 0
Sheppey, 0
Kent. 0

Golding 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
on 0
7 0
March 0
at 0
Folkestone 0
Magistrates’ 0
Court 0
of 0
religiously-aggravated 0
harassment 0
alongside 0
deputy 0
leader 0
Jayda 0
Fransen 0
which 0
they 0
carried 0
out 0
in 0
Kent 0
in 0
May 0
last 0
year. 0

The 0
court 0
heard 0
the 0
pair 0
launched 0
a 0
political 0
campaign 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
trying 0
to 0
expose 0
Muslim 0
men 0
who 0
were 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
a 0
rape 0
trial. 0

So, 0
expose 1
the 1
Islamists 1
fro 1
who 1
and 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
and 1
what 1
Islam's 1
founder 1
not 1
only 1
taught 1
them, 1
but 1
modeled 1
for 1
them, 1
and 0
you 0
may 0
just 0
find 0
yourself 0
in 0
jail 0
in 0

Sadly, 0
the 0

called 0
Robinson's 0

a 0
"disgrace." 1

Tommy 0
Robinson 0

after 0

broadcast 0
details 0
of 0
an 0
ongoing 0
trial 0

He 0
was 0
arrested, 0
brought 0
before 0
a 0
judge, 0
and 0
sentenced 0
within 0
five 0
hours. 0

The 0
judge 0
ordered 0
a 0
media 0
ban 0
on 0
his 0
arrest 0
and 0
imprisonment, 0
even 0
forcing 0
British 0
publications 0
to 0
delete 0
their 0
articles 0
about 0
the 0
case. 0

Such 1
measures 1
are 1
common 1
practice 1
in 1
North 1
Korea 1
and 1
Saudi 1
Arabia. 1

It 0
is 0
sad 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
Britain, 0
the 0
cradle 0
of 0
Western 0
democracy 0
and 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0

is 0
fast 0
descending 1
into 1
tyranny. 1

Tommy 1
is 1
a 1

It 0
is 0
a 0
disgrace 1
that 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
in 0

I'll 0
Say 0
What 0
Kavanaugh 0
Wouldn't: 0
Christine 0
Ford 0
Was 0
Part 0
Of 0
The 0
Political 0
Hit 0
On 0
Him 0
& 0
Here's 0
The 0
Audio 0
Evidence 0

On 0
Thursday, 0
following 0
the 0
hearings 0
where 0
Dr. 0
Christine 0
Ford 0
provided 0
testimony 0
under 0
oath 0
without 0
any 0
evidence 0
at 0
all 0
of 0
a 0
36-year-old 0
alleged 0
sexual 0
attack 0
by 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
his 0
friend 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
Kavanaugh 0
denied 0
the 0
allegations 0
and 0
blasted 1
Senate 1
Democrats 1
for 0
their 0
involvement 0
in 0
ruining 0
his 0
good 0
name. 0

However, 0
when 0
asked 0
by 0
Senator 0
Cory 0
Booker 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Kavanaugh 0
thought 0
Ford 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
what 0
Kavanaugh 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
"political 1
hit" 1
against 0
him, 0
Kavanaugh 0
rightly 0
steered 0
clear 0
of 0
a 0
public 1
relations 1
disaster. 1

However, 0
I 0
am 0
willing 0
to 0
say 0
would 0
he 0
would 0
not: 0
Of 1
course, 1
she 1
was 1
part 1
of 1
it! 1

I 0
don't 0
say 0
this 0
lightly. 0

There 0
are 0
many 0
things 0
that 0
we 0
heard 0
from 0
Ford 0
on 0
Thursday 0
that 0
indicate 0
there 0
is 0
more 0
going 0
on 0
than 0
she 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
say. 0

Clearly, 0
Ford 0
has 0
been 0
outed 0
as 0
a 1
radical 1
political 1
activist 1
who 1
promotes 1
baby 1
murder 1
and 1
other 1
unlawful 1
actions. 1

However, 0
her 1
story 1
didn't 1
exactly 1
lend 1
credibility 1
except 0
with 0
Democrat 0
members 0
of 0
the 0

official 0
who 0
is 0
now 0

to 0

said 0
in 0
July 0
(at 0
roughly 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
as 0
the 0
letter 0
was 0
submitted) 0
that 0
she 0
predicted 0
a 0
"strategy" 0
forming 0
to 1
destroy 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh. 1

She 0
suggested 0
a 0
“strategy 0
will 0
emerge” 0
to 1
destroy 1
Trump's 1
nomination 1
for 1
the 1
Supreme 1
Court 1
in 0
a 0
conference 0
call 0
with 0
the 0
American 0
Constitution 0
Society 0
in 0
July. 0

“I 0
do 0
think 0
that 0
over 0
the 0
coming 0
days 0
and 0
weeks 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
strategy 0
that 0
will 0
emerge, 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
it’s 0
possible 0
that 0
strategy 0
might 0
ultimately 0
defeat 0
the 0
nominee,” 0
Seidman 0
said 0
in 0
audio 0
that 0
was 0
recorded 0
by 0
the 0
Republican 0
National 0
Committee’s 0
War 0
Room. 0

“And 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
it 1
ultimately 1
defeats 1
the 1
nominee 1
it 1
will, 1
I 1
think, 1
help 1
people 1
understand 1
why 1
it’s 1
so 1
important 1
that 1
they 1
vote.” 1

If 1
you 1
think 1
Mrs. 1
Ford 1
is 1
ignorant 1
of 1
this 1
considering 1
her 1
father 1
works 1
for 1
the 1
Central 1
Intelligence 1
Agency 1
and 1
her 1
prior 1
criminal 1
political 1
activism, 1
then 1
you 1
aren't 1
thinking 1
clearly. 1

Ford 1
obviously 1
has 1
mental 1
issues 1
and 1
that 1
was 1
on 1
display 1
on 1
Thursday 1
during 1
her 1
testimony. 1

She 0
clearly 0
tried 0
to 0
present 0
herself 0
as 0
a 0
victim 0
while 0
she 0
accused 0
Kavanaugh 0
of 0
sexual 0
assault 0
with 0
absolutely 1
no 1
evidence. 1

Kavanaugh 0
even 0
responded 0
by 0
pointing 0
out 0
that 0
even 0
her 0
friends 0
said 0
they 0
don't 0
recall 0
such 0
an 0
incident 0
and 0
had 0
literally 0
hundreds 0
of 0
people 0
commend 0
his 0
character 0
as 0
the 0
direct 0
opposite 0
of 0
what 0
Ford 0
claims. 0

As 0
I've 0
said 0
before, 0
I 0
don't 0
support 0
Kavanaugh's 0
appointment 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
on 0
the 0
grounds 0
of 0
lack 0
of 0
constitutional 0
rulings, 0
but 0
that 1
attack 1
on 1
him 1
was 1
orchestrated, 1
it 1
was 1
political 1
and 1
Ford 1
was 1
a 1
part 1
of 1
it. 1

It's 0
wrong. 0

Ford 0
didn't 0
even 0
think 0
to 0
act, 0
according 0
to 0
her 0
testimony, 0
until 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
short 0
list, 0
but 1
did 1
she 1
go 1
to 1
local 1
law 1
enforcement? 1

Nope. 0

She 0
went 0
to 0
her 0
US 0
Democrat 0
representative, 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
and 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post. 0

If 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
political, 0
I 0
don't 0
know 0
what 0
is. 0

Ford 1
is 1
not 1
seeking 1
justice 1
nor 1
is 1
she 1
seeking 1
to 1
do 1
her 1
"civic 1

At 0
the 0
Hammonds’ 0
original 0
sentencing, 0
the 0
judge 0
noted 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
respected 0
in 0
the 0
community 0
and 0
that 0
imposing 0
the 0
mandatory 0
minimum, 0
5-year 0

sentence 0
would 0
“shock 1

conscience” 1
and 0
be 0
“grossly 1

to 1

of 0
their 0
conduct. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
the 0
judge 0
imposed 0
significantly 0
lesser 0
sentences. 0

The 0
previous 0
administration, 0
however, 0
filed 0
an 0
overzealous 1
appeal 0
that 0
resulted 0
in 0
the 0
Hammonds 0
being 0
sentenced 0
to 0
five 0
years 0
in 0
prison. 0

This 0
was 0
unjust. 1

Dwight 0
Hammond 0
is 0
now 0
76 0
years 0
old 0
and 0
has 0
served 0
approximately 0
three 0
years 0

Steven 0
Hammond 0
is 0
49 0
and 0
has 0
served 0
approximately 0
four 0

They 0

paid 0
$400,000 0
to 0
the 0
United 0

to 0

is 0

Dwight 0

Hammond, 0
both 0
of 0
whom 0
are 0
entirely 1

Well, 0
it 0
took 0
long 0
enough, 0
but 0
thank 0
you 0
President 0
Trump. 0

You 0
did 0
the 0

And 0
for 0
all 0
those 0
who 0
took 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
keep 0
this 0
story 0
alive 0
and 0
urge 0
people 0
to 0
petition 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
the 0
Hammonds, 0
thank 0
you! 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
protests 0
that 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
Oregon 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
years 0
ago 0
were 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
injustice 1
the 0
Hammonds 0
faced. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
Robert 0
"LaVoy" 0
Finicum 0
was 0
killed 0
by 0
Oregon 0
State 0
Police. 0

Those 0
who 0
led 0
the 0
protest 0
were 0
all 0
acquitted 0
of 0
all 0
charges 0
and 0
reporter 0
Pete 0
Santilli 0
had 0
all 0
of 0
his 0
charges 0
dismissed. 0

No 0
doubt, 0
Finicum 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
found 0
not 0
guilty 0
as 0
well, 0
but 0
that's 0
not 0
how 0
tyrants 1
work, 0
is 0
it? 0

Today 0
is 0
a 0
day 0
to 0
celebrate 0
a 0
wrong 0
that 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
fully 0

Following 0

appeared 0
for 0
months 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
strained 0
relationship 0
between 0
President 0

and 0
Secretary 0

State 0
Rex 0
Tillerson, 0
the 0
top 0
diplomat 0
is 0
being 0
replaced. 0

Trump 0
announced 0
Tillerson’s 0
ouster 0
via 0
Twitter 0
Tuesday, 0
saying: 0
“Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
will 0
become 0
our 0
new 0
Secretary 0
of 0

and 0
the 0
first 0

so 0
chosen. 0

Congratulations 0
to 0
all!” 0

This 0
is 0
yet 0
another 0
big 0
shake-up 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
still-young 0
administration 0
— 0
and 1
it 1
may 1
be 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
one 1
to 1
date. 1

The 1
move 1
creates 1
some 1
big 1
questions 1
about 1
both 1
the 1
administration’s 1
foreign 1
policy 1
ambitions 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
president’s 1
relationship 1
with 1
the 1
deep 1
state. 1

If 1
you 1
enjoyed 1
Hillary 1
Clinton’s 1
tenure 1
as 1
Secretary 1
of 1
State, 1
you’ll 1
like 1
Pompeo’s. 1

Like 0
Clinton 0
and 0
her 0
Democrat 0
allies, 0
Pompeo 0
has 0
long 0
subscribed 0
to 0
the 0
belief 0
that 0
Russia 0
is 1
perpetually 1
meddling 1
in 0
U.S. 0
affairs. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 1
believes 1
Barack 1
Obama 1
got 1
Russian 1
help 1
too. 1

While 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
confirmed 0
as 0
CIA 0
chief, 0
the 0
former 0
lawmaker 0
lashed 1
out 1
at 1
Russia 1
for 0
reasserting 1
” 1
itself 1
aggressively, 1
invading 1
and 1
occupying 1
Ukraine, 1
threatening 1
Europe, 1
and 1
doing 1
nearly 1
nothing 1
to 1
aid 1
in 1
the 1
destruction 1
and 1
defeat 1
of 1
ISIS.” 1

Again, 0
if 0
you 0
liked 0
Obama-era, 0
world-on-fire, 0
Russians 0
everywhere 0
State 1
Department 1
shenanigans, 1
this 1
is 1
your 1
guy. 1

Pompeo 1
also 1
isn’t 1
a 1
huge 1
fan 1
of 1
calling 1
the 1
federal 1
government 1
out 1
when 1
it 1
is 1
clearly 1
violating 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
Americans, 1
as 0
shown 0
by 0
his 0
statements 0
last 0
year 0

“It 0

that 0

nothing’s 1

She’s 1
a 1
big 1
fan 1
of 1
torture, 1
according 0
to 0
a 0
2013 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article 0
pointed 0
out 0
this 0
morning 0
by 0
The 0
Intercept: 0

IN 0
MAY 0
2013, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
Greg 0
Miller 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
clandestine 0
service 0
was 0
being 0
shifted 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“a 0
management 0
shake-up” 0
by 0
then-Director 0
John 0
Brennan. 0

As 0
Miller 0
documented, 0
this 0
official 0
— 0
whom 0
the 0
paper 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
because 0
she 0
was 0
a 0
covert 0
agent 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
— 0
was 0
centrally 0
involved 0
in 0
the 1
worst 1
abuses 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
Bush-era 1
torture 1
regime. 1

As 0
Miller 0
put 0
it, 0
she 0
was 0
“directly 0
involved 0
in 0
its 0
controversial 0
interrogation 0
program” 0
and 0
had 0
an 0
“extensive 0
role” 0
in 0
torturing 0
detainees. 0

Even 0
more 0
troubling, 0
she 0
“had 0
run 0
a 0
secret 0
prison 0
in 0
Thailand” 0
— 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
network 0
of 0
“black 0
sites” 0
— 0
“where 0
two 0
detainees 0
were 0
subjected 0
to 0
waterboarding 0
and 0
other 0
harsh 1
techniques.” 1
The 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee’s 0
report 0
on 0
torture 0
also 0
detailed 0
the 0
central 0
role 0
she 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
particularly 1
gruesome 1
torture 1
of 0
detainee 0
Abu 0
Zubaydah. 0

Beyond 0
all 0
that, 0
she 0
played 0
a 0
vital 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
interrogation 0
videotapes 0
that 0
showed 0
the 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
both 0
at 0
the 0
black 0
site 0
she 0
ran 0
and 0
other 0
secret 0
agency 0
locations. 0

The 0
concealment 0
of 0
those 0
interrogation 0
tapes, 0
which 0
violated 0
multiple 0
court 0
orders 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
9/11 0
commission 0
and 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
White 0
House 0
lawyers, 0
was 0
condemned 0
as 0
“obstruction” 0
by 0
commission 0
chairs 0
Lee 0
Hamilton 0
and 0
Thomas 0
Keane. 0

A 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
and 0
grand 0
jury 0
investigated 0
those 0
actions 0
but 0
ultimately 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

Bottom 0

The 0
media 0
has 0
2 0
very 0
simple 0
rules 0
for 0
Holocaust 0
analogies. 0

1. 0

The 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood's 0
leaders 0
praising 0
Hitler, 0
calling 0
for 0
another 0
Holocaust 0
and 0
killing 0
Jews 0
is 0
nothing 0
like 0
the 0
Holocaust. 0

And 0
only 1
shameless 1
Zionists 1
would 1
attempt 1
to 1
equate 1
killing 1
Jews 1
with 1
killing 1
Jews. 1

2. 0

Anything 1
a 1
Republican 1
president 1
does 1
is 1
exactly 1
like 1
the 1
Holocaust. 1

A 0
former 0
CIA 0
director 0
compared 1
US 1
immigration 1
policy 1
to 1
Nazi 1
Germany 1
in 0
an 0
ominous 0
Tweet. 0

“Other 0
governments 0
have 0
separated 0
mothers 0
and 0
children,” 0
Former 0
CIA 0
and 0
NSA 0
chief 0
Michael 0
Hayden 0
wrote 0
on 0
Saturday, 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
black 0
and 0
white 0
photo 0
of 0
the 0
Birkenau 0
concentration 0
and 0
death-camp 1
in 0
Poland. 0

Then 0
Hayden 0
doubled 0
down 0
on 0
that 0
analogy. 0

It's 0
particularly 1
stupid 1
of 0
Michael 0
Hayden 0
to 0
make 0
that 0
analogy 0
because 0
during 0
the 0
Bush 0
years, 0
the 0
agencies 0
he 0
ran 0
were 0
compared 0
to 0
Nazi 1
Germany. 0

Repeatedly. 0

You 0
might 0
think 0
that 0
would 0
have 0
cured 0
him 0
of 0
facile 0
Nazi 1
analogies. 0

But 0
instead 0
it 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
whetted 0
his 0
appetite 0
for 0
making 0
them. 0

Yes, 0
the 0
Nazi 1
arrested 0
people, 0
asked 0
them 0
for 0
ID, 0
split 0
up 0
families 0
and... 0
then 0
killed 1
them 1
all. 1

That's 0
the 0
really 0
relevant 0
part. 0

Every 0
country 0
arrests 0
people. 0

Just 0
about 0
every 0
country 0
splits 0
up 0
families 0
when 0
they 0
arrest 0
the 0
parents. 0

That's 0
not 0
unique. 0

Selecting 0
the 0
Jews, 0
based 0
on 0
race, 0
for 0
extermination 1
is 0
more 0
of 0
the 0
reason 0
why 0
the 0
term 0
Nazi 1
is 0
not 0
a 0
positive 0
one. 0

Hayden's 0
thoughtless 1
tweet 0
can 0
just 0
as 0
easily 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
delegitimize 0
any 0
and 0
all 0
law 0
enforcement. 0

The 1
attacks 1
here 1
are 1
motivated 1
by 1
a 1
desire 1
for 1
open 1
borders. 1

Children 0
are 0

was 0
suspended 0
“until 0

back-and-forth 0
over 0
the 0
migrant 0
caravan 0
working 0
its 0
way 0
up 0
through 0
Mexico. 0

Trump 0
characterizes 0
the 0
caravan 0
as 0
“an 1
invasion,” 1
a 0
term 0
to 0
which 0
Acosta 0
objected. 0

“Honestly, 0
I 0
think 0
you 0

let 0
me 0
run 0
the 0
country 0

you 0
run 0

the 0

The 0

him 0
another 0
question 0
before 0
a 0
female 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
walked 0
over 0
to 0
him. 0

Trump 0
then 0
told 0
him, 0
“That’s 0
enough!” 0

Acosta 0
continued 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
talk 0
as 0
the 0
intern 0
was 0
seen 0
trying 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
microphone 0
from 0
his 0
hand. 0

She 0
grabbed 0
the 0
microphone 0
but 0
Acosta 0
wouldn’t 0
give 0
it 0
up 0
and 0
there 0
was 0
brief 0
contact 0
between 0
the 0
two. 0

White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
said 0
the 0
suspension 0
of 0
his 0
press 0
credentials 0
stemmed 0
from 0
his 0
“placing 0
his 0
hands 0
on 0
a 0
young 0
woman 0
just 0
trying 0
to 0
do 0
her 0
job 0
as 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
intern.” 0
She 0
called 0
the 0
behavior 0
“absolutely 1
unacceptable.” 1

Several 0
news 0

accused 0
Sanders 0
of 0
using 0
a 0
“doctored” 0
video 0
as 0
evidence, 0
but 0
the 0

“We 0

His 0

that 0
the 0

“They 0
interpreted 0

say 0
it 0

Saucier 0
told 0

referring 0

“but 1
they 1

We 0

Daigle 0
said 0
that 0

to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
others 0
included 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
December. 0

There 0
is 0
usually 0
a 0
six-month 0
period 0
that 0
must 0
lapse 0
before 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
actually 0
is 0
filed. 0

“We’ll 0

Hillary 0

was 0
prosecuted 0
and 0
how 0
my 0

“We’re 0

no 0
understanding 0
and 0

the 0
facts 0
involved, 0
the 0
information 0
at 0
issue, 0

Saucier 0
confessed 0
to 0
taking 0
photos 0
of 0
the 0
submarine 0
back 0
in 0
2009 0
when 0
he 0
served 0
as 0
a 0
22-year-old 0
machinist 0
mate, 0
saying 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
pictures 0
to 0
his 0
family 0
and 0
future 0
children. 0

Following 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
FBI 0
in 0
2012, 0
he 0
destroyed 0
all 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
pictures, 0
meaning 0
the 0
Naval 0
Criminal 0
Investigative 0
Service 0
could 0
not 0
confirm 0
his 0
claims 0
that 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
share 0
the 0
photos 0
with 0
unauthorized 0
people. 0

“It 0
was 0
a 0
foolish 1
mistake 0
by 0
a 0
very 0
young 0
man,” 0
Saucier’s 0
lawyer, 0
Greg 0
Rinckey, 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
a 0
very 0
sad 0
case 0
because 0
Kristian 0
Saucier 0
is 0
a 1
fine 1
young 1
man. 1

We 0
don’t 0
believe 0
this 0
was 0
really 0
his 0
true 0
character.” 0

“My 0
case 0
was 0
usually 0
something 0
handled 0
by 0
military 0
courts,” 0
Saucier 0
said. 0

“They 1
used 1
me 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
because 1
of 1
[the 1
backlash 1
over] 1
Hillary 1
Clinton,” 1
he 0
continued, 0
alleging 0
his 0
life 0
was 0
ruined 0
for 0
political 0
reasons. 0

President 0
Trump 0
had 0
spoken 0
of 0
his 0
support 0
of 0
Saucier 0
on 0
the 0
campaign 0
trail 0
and 0
blasted 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration's 0
handling 0
of 0
his 0
case. 0

“With 0
a 0
pardon, 0
there’s 0
no 0
magic 0
wand 0
that 0
gets 0
waved 0
and 0
makes 0
everything 0
right,” 0
Saucier 0
said, 0
“But 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
stay 0
positive 0
and 0
look 0
forward.” 0

That's 0
a 0
good 0
attitude 0
considering 0
he 0
has 0
had 0
his 0
cars 0
repossessed 0
and 0
is 0
in 0
a 0
tremendous 1
amount 0
of 0
debt 0
due 0
to 0
his 0
incarceration 0
and 0
now 0
having 0
a 0
felony 0
on 0
his 0
record. 0

But 0
hey, 0
Hillary 0
is 0
free, 0
right? 0

That's 0
all 0
that 0
matters, 0
cause 0
after 0
all, 0
they're 0
(Bill 0
and 0
Hillary) 0
good 0
people, 0
aren't 0
they, 0
Mr. 0
President? 0

I 0
think 0
it's 0
great 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Saucier 0
has 0
been 0
pardoned, 0
I 0
really 0
do, 0
but 0
I 0
continue 0
to 0
ask 0
what 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
Americans 1
continue 0
to 0
ask, 0
why 0
does 0
the 1
known 1
criminal 1
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
remain 0
at 0
large 0
in 0
our 1
country 1
with 0
her 0
corrupt 1
foundation 0
taking 0
in 0
billions, 0
her 0
trashing 1
our 1
Republic 1
and 0
continuing 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
national 0
voice? 0

The 1
American 1
people 1
weren't 0
promised 0
pardons, 0
we 0
were 0
promised 0
a 0
special 0
counsel 0
to 0
dig 0
into 0
the 0
Clintons 0
and 0
bring 0
about 0
justice. 0

It's 0
time 0
that 0
occurred. 0

Et 0
Tu, 0
Benedict? 0
(Some 0
Final 0
Thoughts 0
on 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger) 0

Recently 0

an 0
editor 0
of 0
a 0
“conservative” 0
Catholic 0
magazine 0
asked 0
me 0
if 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
interested 0
in 0
contributing 0
a 0
piece 0
about 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
five 0
years 0
on. 0

I 0
declined, 0
telling 0
him 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
morally 0
certain 0
that 0
anything 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
it 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
his 0
editorial 0
policies. 0

It’s 0
been 0
five 0
years, 0
and 0
I’ve 0
noticed 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
lot 0
fewer 0
people 0
talking 0
about 0
what 0
a 0
“courageous” 0
act 0
it 0
was 0
to 0
give 0
up 0
the 0
pontificate. 0

The 0
consequences 0
of 0
that 0
act 0
have 0
been 0
so 1
outlandish 1
– 0
even 0
for 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
mostly 0
OK 0
with 0
Francis 0
– 0
that 0
very 0
few 0
people 0
are 0
still 0
willing 0
to 0
make 0
polite 0
noises 0
about 0
it. 0

Editor's 0
Note: 0
In 0
a 0
March 0
11th 0
letter 0
signed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Emeritus 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
and 0
addressed 0
to 0
Msgr. 0

Dario 0
Vigano, 0
prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
for 0
Communications, 0
the 0
former 0
pope 0
reportedly 0
offers 0
an 0
impassioned 1
defense 1
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
against 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
he 0
lacks 0
theological 0
and 0
philosophical 0
formation. 0

In 0
no 0
uncertain 0
terms, 0
this 0
letter, 0
bearing 0
Benedict's 0
signature, 0
affirms 0
that 0
“there 0
is 0
an 0
internal 0
continuity 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
pontificates.” 0
Whether 0
Benedict 0
actually 0
wrote 0
this 0
letter 0
or 0
not, 0
it 0
gives 0
rise 0
to 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
grave 1
questions 1
that 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
answered 0
rather 0
urgently 0
before 0
history 0
closes 0
the 0
book 0
on 0
this 0
commedia 1
diabolica. 1

Our 0
thanks 0
to 0
Remnant 0
columnist, 0
Hilary 0
White, 0
for 0
addressing 0
the 0
most 0
pertinent 0
of 0
these 0
here 0
below. 0

MJM 0

In 0
fact, 0
five 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
mostly 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
why; 0
why 0
would 0
a 0
pope 0
– 0
a 0
man 0
with 0
decades 0
of 0
up-close-and-personal 0
experience 0
of 0
the 0
“filth” 1
in 0
the 0
Curia 0
and 0
throughout 0
the 0
church 0
– 0
suddenly 0
just 0
decide 0
to 0
quit? 0

Why 0
would 0
he 0
choose 0
to 0
walk 0
away 0
knowing 0
that 0
his 0
task 0
was 0
not 0
completed? 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
since 0
then, 0
particularly 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
what 0
has 0
been 0
happening, 0
it 0
seems 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
bizarre 1
aspects 1
of 1
this 1
whole 1
bizarre 1
situation 1
that 0
the 0
reasons 0
offered 0
have 0
been 0
so 1
trivial, 1
so 1
inappropriately, 1
so 1
disproportionately 1
petty. 1

These 0
absurd 1
responses 1
to 1
serious 1
questions 1
of 1
grave 1
import 1
have 0
raised 0
the 0
inescapable 0
suspicion 0
that 0
Benedict 0
simply 0
did 0
not 0
take 0
the 0
papacy 0
as 0
seriously 0
as 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
us 0
did. 0

We 0
cannot 0
help 0
but 0
wonder 0
if 0
these 0
trivialised 0
responses 0
reveal 0
some 0
deep 0
flaw 0
that 0
we 0
had 0
never 0
suspected 0
before. 0

Could 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
wrong 1
about 1
him? 1

And 1
if 1
so, 1
could 1
we 1
have 1
been 1
this 1
wrong? 1

For 0
reasons, 0
all 0
we 0
heard 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
was, 0
essentially, 0
“I’m 1
tired.” 1
There 0
was 0
some 0
implication 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
up 0
to 0
international 0
travel 0
anymore, 0
so 0
couldn’t 0
make 0
it 0
to 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day 0
and 0
similar 0
events. 0

The 0
trivialising 0
of 0
the 0
resignation 0
seemed 0
to 0
go 0
hand 0
in 0
hand 0
with 0
the 0
modern 0
concept 0
of 0
the 0
pope-as-pop-star, 1
something 0
we 0
had 0
thought 0
Benedict 0
was 0
too 0
serious 0
a 0
man, 0
too 0
serious 0
a 0
Catholic, 0
to 0
believe 0
himself. 0

Of 0
all 0
people, 0
we 0
had 0
assumed 0
that 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
took 0
the 0
papacy 0
seriously. 0

And 0
since 0
then, 0
as 0
all 0
the 0
poisons 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
lurking 0
for 0
fifty 0
years 0
in 0
the 0
NewChurch 1
mud 1
are 0
busily 0
hatching 0
out, 0
many 0
Catholics 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
we 0
hear 0
nothing 0
from 0
him? 0

This 0
man 0
whom 0
we 0
had 0
believed 0
a 0
“champion 1
of 1
orthodoxy,” 1
whom 0
we 0
thought 0
we 0
knew. 0

Error, 0
even 0
heresy 1
and 1
blasphemy 1
are 0
pouring 0
daily 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
mouth 0
of 0
his 0
successor, 0
who 0
has, 0
literally, 0
turned 1
the 1
Vatican 1
into 1
a 1
den 1
of 1
thieves, 1
and 0
we 0
hear 0
nothing 0
but 0
the 0
occasional, 0
carefully 0
worded 0
statement 0
on 0
how 0
fine 0
everything 0
is. 0

How 0
content 0
he 0
is 0
with 0
his 0
decision 0
and 0
how 0
happy 0
with 0
his 0
current 0
life. 0

After 0
three 0
years 0
of 0
systematic 0
dismantling 0
of 0
everything 0
he 0
had 0
attempted 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
his 0
pontificate, 0
we 0
got 0
this 0
from 0
an 0
apparently 0
utterly 1
insouciant 1
Ratzinger, 0
addressed 0
to 0
Francis: 0
“Your 0
goodness 0
is 0
my 0
home 0
and 0
the 0
place 0
where 0
I 0
feel 0
safe.” 0
Everyone 0
who 0
had 0
ever 0
read 0
anything 0
he 0
had 0
written 0
were 0
amazed 0
he 0
was 0
capable 0
of 0
producing 0
such 0
maudlin 0
drivel, 0
but 0
the 0
video 0
doesn’t 0
lie: 0

So 0
strange 0
was 0
this 0
new 0
tone 0
that 0
speculation 0
started 0
circulating 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
under 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
external 0
compulsion, 0
not 0
free 0
to 0
speak 0
his 0
mind. 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
we 0
see. 0

There 0
he 0
is, 0
manifestly 0
happy 0
and 0
reading 0
it 0
out 0
loud. 0

“Perhaps 0
it 0
was 0
written 0
for 0
him.” 0
Well, 0
why 0
repeat 0
it 0
then? 0

Why, 0
if 0
he 0
has 0
any 0
qualms, 0
allow 0
himself 0
to 0
be 0
trotted 0
out 0
on 0
such 0
occasions, 0
to 0
read 0
this 0
blatant 0
propaganda? 0

If 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
deception, 0
why 0
participate 0
in 0
it? 0

In 0
fact, 0
all 0
the 0
hopeful 0
commenters 0
on 0
blogs 0
and 0
other 0
social 0
media 0
who 0
keep 0
telling 0
me 0
how 0
much 0
they 0
“miss” 0
him 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
respect 0
him 0
in 0
one 0
way; 0
they 0
won’t 0
take 0
him 0
at 0
his 0
word. 0

Some 0
insist 0
that 0
his 0
resignation 0
was 0
under 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
coercion 0
and 0
so 0
isn’t 0
valid. 0

But 0
we 0
have 0
repeatedly 0
heard 0
from 0
him 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
under 0
no 0
constraint, 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
resigned 0
freely. 0

And 0
indeed, 0
far 0
from 0
being 0
an 0
isolated 0
“prisoner 1
of 1
the 1
Vatican,” 1
Benedict 0
has 0
received 0
many 0
guests 0
all 0
of 0
whom 0
report 0
that, 0
though 0
frail, 0
he 0
appears 0
content 0
and 0
never 0
utters 0
a 0
word 0
of 0
criticism. 0

We 0
have 0
yet 0
to 0
hear 0
any 0
report 0
of 0
any 0
notes 0
begging 0
for 0
rescue 0
hidden 0
under 0
a 0
lunch 0
table 0
placemat. 0

There’s 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
extremely 0
strange 0
and 0
frankly 0
fishy 0
situation; 0
something 0
doesn’t 0
add 0
up, 0
it’s 0
true. 0

All 0
the 0
questions 0
have 0
gone 0
ignored, 0
or 0
have 0
received 0
frivolous, 1
jokey 1
responses: 1

Why 0
did 0
you 0
resign? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“I 0
was 0
a 0
bit 0
tired 0
and 0
didn’t 0
feel 0
up 0
to 0
partying 0
with 0
the 0
kids 0
at 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day.” 0

If 0
you’re 0
not 0
pope, 0
why 0
do 0
you 0
still 0
wear 0
the 0
white? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“Oh, 0
there 0
wasn’t 0
a 0
black 0
cassock 0
that 0
fit 0
me.” 0

Why 0
do 0
you 0
continue 0
to 0
call 0
yourself 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
pope? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“Well, 0
I’m 0
an 0
‘emeritus,’ 0
you 0
see…” 0

And 0
where 0
did 0
this 0
“emeritus” 0
business 0
come 0
from? 0

Does 0
it 0
have 0
any 0
precedent 0
in 0
Catholic 0
history? 0

What 0
does 0
it 0
mean 0
canonically 0
and 0
doctrinally? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“…” 0

What 0
was 0
all 1
that 1
rubbish 1
from 0
Ganswein 0
about 0
there 0
being 0
a 0
divided 0
“munus” 0
– 0
with 0
an 0
active 0
member 0
and 0
a 0
“contemplative 0
member”? 0

Doesn’t 0
that 0
just 0
mean 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
popes 0
now? 0

Ratzinger: 0
“…” 0

And 0
perhaps 0
most 0
agonising 0
of 0
all: 0
“How 1
can 1
you 1
just 1
sit 1
there 1
smiling, 1
issuing 1
bland 1
platitudinous 1
nonsense, 1
while 1
this 1
lunatic 1
drives 1
the 1
sheep 1
off 1
a 1
cliff?” 1

A 0
few 0
days 0
ago, 0
my 0
friend 0
Steve 0
Skojec, 0
of 0
the 0
traditionalist/restorationist 0
website 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five, 0
summed 0
up 0
the 0
consternation 0
of 0
those 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
still 0
feel 0
a 0
lingering 0
affection 0
for 0
(the 0
man 0
we 0
used 0
to 0
call) 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

Steve 0
summons 0
up 0
in 0
this 0
brief 0
post 0
all 0
the 0
anger 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
crushing 1
disappointment 1
most 0
of 0
us 0
probably 0
still 0
feel 0
reluctant 0
to 0
express 0
out 0
loud: 0

Five 0
years 0
ago 0
today, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
abdicated 0
the 0
papacy. 0

And 0
through 0
the 0
abandonment 0
of 0
his 0
duty 0
to 0
shepherd 0
the 0
Church, 0
he 0
made 0
way 0
for 0
the 0
worst 0
papacy 0
of 0
all 0
time 0
– 0
one 0
he 0
steadfastly 0
refuses 0
to 0
oppose 0
in 0
word, 0
deed, 0
or 0
even 0
the 0
subtlest 0
gesture. 0

You 0
may 0
love 0
him 0
for 0
various 0
reasons, 0
you 0
may 0
miss 0
him 0
by 0
contrast, 0
but 0
you 0
may 0
not 0
excuse 0
the 0
responsibility 0
he 0
has. 0

He 0
walked 0
away 0
from 0
his 0
family, 0
leaving 0
the 0
door 0
open 0
to 0
an 0
abusive 1
stepfather, 1
and 0
he 0
watches 1
his 1
children 1
beaten 1
and 1
led 1
astray 1
not 0
just 0
in 0
silence, 0
but 0
in 0
apparent 0
contentment. 0

And 0
still, 0
he 0
was 0
the 0
best 0
of 0
the 0
post-conciliar 0
popes, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
he’s 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
who 0
won’t 0
be 0
canonized. 0

Who 0
is 0
the 0
real 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger? 0

I 0
have 0
had 0
long-time 0
Vatican 0
watchers 0
say 0
to 0
me, 0
more 0
than 0
once, 0
“Maybe 0
it’s 0
really 0
just 0
that 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
who 0
we 0
thought 0
he 0
was.” 0
I 0
suspect 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
more 0
to 0
this 0
than 0
most 0
people 0
might 0
imagine. 0

I 0
think 0
we 0
made 0
the 0
mistake 0
of 0
believing 0
the 0
press. 0

We 0
were 0
delighted 0
that 0
the 0
bitterly 1
anti-Catholic 1
media 1
hated 0
and 0
feared 0
him. 0

We 0
failed 0
to 0
recall 0
that 0
they 0
know 0
nothing 0
at 0
all 0
about 0
Catholicism. 0

What 0
the 0
papers 0
never 0
told 0
us 0
was 0
that 0
as 0
a 0
young 0
priest 0
and 0
theologian 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
was 1
known 1
as 1
a 1
“progressive,” 1
as 0
the 0
term 0
was 0
understood 0
in 0
1962. 0

This 0
reputation 0
was 0
cemented 0
during 0
his 0
work 0
as 0
the 0
peritus, 0
the 0
theological 0
advisor, 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
Council’s 0
most 0
influential 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
the 0
progressive 0
camp, 0
Cardinal 0
Josef 0
Frings 0
of 0
Cologne. 0

Frings’ 0
claim 0
to 0
fame 0
in 0
that 0
great 0
drama 0
was 0
a 0
speech 0
criticising 0
the 0
CDF 0
– 0
and 0
its 0
prefect 0
Cardinal 0
Alfredo 0
Ottaviani 0
– 0
for 0
the 0
“conservatism” 0
in 0
the 0
“schema,” 0
the 0
documents 0
prepared 0
by 0
the 0
CDF 0
for 0
guiding 0
the 0
bishops’ 0
discussions. 0

After 0
this 0
speech, 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
uprising 0
among 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
the 0
preparatory 0
committee 0
who 0
demanded 0
that 0
the 0
schema 0
– 0
that 0
had 0
taken 0
years 0
to 0
develop 0
– 0
be 0
abandoned. 0

This 0
was 0
done, 0
over 0
Ottaviani’s 0
futile 1
objections, 1
and 0
new 0
documents 0
were 0
rapidly 0
cobbled 0
together 0
by 0
a 0
coalition 0
of 0
German 0
and 0
French 0
“progressives” 1
who 0
rejoiced 0
that 0
they 0
had, 0
in 0
effect, 0
seized 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
from 0
that 0
moment, 0
before 0
it 0
had 0
even 0
started. 0

It 0
has 0
since 0
been 0
revealed 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
– 0
the 0
maverick 0
“progressive” 1
academic 1
theologian 1
Frings 1
had 0
brought 0
to 0
Rome 0
as 0
his 0
secretary 0
– 0
who 0
wrote 0
that 0
speech. 0

Cardinal 0
Henri 0
de 0
Lubac, 0
writing 0
in 0
1985, 0
recalling 0
that 0
drama, 0
said: 0

“Joseph 0
Ratzinger, 0
an 0
expert 0
at 0
the 0
Council, 0
was 0
also 0
the 0
private 0
secretary 0
of 0
Card. 0

Frings, 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Cologne. 0

Blind, 0
the 0
old 0
Cardinal 0
largely 0
utilized 0
his 0
secretary 0
to 0
write 0
his 0
interventions. 0

Now 0
then, 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
interventions 0
became 0
memorable: 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
radical 0
criticism 0
of 0
the 0
methods 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
Office. 0

Despite 0
a 0
reply 0
by 0
Card. 0

Ottaviani, 0
Frings 0
sustained 0
his 0
critique. 0

“It 0

is 0
not 0
an 0
exaggeration 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
on 0
that 0
day 0
the 0
old 0
Holy 0
Office, 0
as 0
it 0
presented 0
itself 0
then, 0
was 0
destroyed 0
by 0
Ratzinger 0
in 0
union 0
with 0
his 0
Archbishop. 0

“Card. 0

Seper, 0

a 1
man 1
full 1
of 1
goodness, 1
intiated 0
the 0
renovation. 0

Ratzinger, 0
who 0
did 0
not 0
change, 0
continues 0
it.” 0

Ratzinger’s 0
reputation 0
as 0
a 0
“progressive” 1
is 0
not 0
based 0
on 0
one 0
incident, 0
nor 0
was 0
it 0
restricted 0
to 0
his 0
early 0
work. 0

It 0
went 0
unnoticed 0
in 0
the 0
shouting 0
over 0
his 0
running 0
of 0
CDF, 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
written 0
in 0
1982, 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
“never 0
to 0
return” 0
to 0
the 0
Syllabus 0
of 0
Errors 0
of 0
Pius 0
IX. 0

In 0
his 0
book 0
Principles 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Theology, 0
Ratzinger 0
proposed 0
the 0
question, 0
“Should 0
the 0
Council 0
be 0
revoked?” 0
and 0
in 0
response 0
recommended 0
the 0
“razing 0
of 0
the 0
bastions” 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
in 0
relation 0
to 0
the 0
modern 0
world: 0

The 0
duty 0
is, 0
therefore, 0
not 0
to 0
suppress 0
the 0
Council, 0
but 0
to 0
discover 0
the 0
real 0
Council 0
and 0
delve 0
deep 0
into 0
what 0
it 0
truly 0
wants 0
with 0
regard 0
to 0
what 0
has 0
happened 0
since 0
then. 0

This 0

implies 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
possible 0
return 0
to 0
the 0
Syllabus, 0
which 0
could 0
well 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
first 0
step 0
in 0
the 0
combat 0
against 0
Liberalism 0
and 0
the 0
nascent 0
Marxism, 0
but 0
which 0
cannot 0
be 0
the 0
last 0
word. 0

Neither 0
embraces 0
nor 0
the 0
ghetto 0
can 0
resolve 0
the 0
problem 0
of 0
[relations 0
with] 0
the 0
modern 0
world 0
for 0
the 0
Christian. 0

Hence, 0
the 0
'razing 0
of 0
the 0
bastions' 0
that 0
Hans 0
Urs 0
von 0
Balthasar 0
called 0
for 0
already 0
in 0
1952 0
was 0
in 0
effect 0
an 0
urgent 0
duty. 0

It 0
was 0
necessary 0
for 0
her 0
[the 0
Church] 0
to 0
raze 0
the 0
old 0
bastions 0
and 0
confide 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
protection 0
of 0
the 0
faith, 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
word 0
that 0
is 0
her 0
unique, 0
true, 0
and 0
permanent 0
strength. 0

But 0
to 0
raze 0
the 0
bastions 0
cannot 0
signify 0
that 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
has 0
anything 0
to 0
protect, 0
or 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
live 0
owing 0
to 0
different 0
forces 0
than 0
those 0
that 0
engendered 0
her: 0
the 1
water 1
and 1
the 1
blood 1
that 1
poured 1
from 1
the 1
open 1
side 1
of 1
her 1
crucified 1
Lord. 1

His 0
was 0
the 0
thesis 0
– 0
a 0
mainstay 0
of 0
“conservative” 0
ideology 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
“real” 0
Council, 0
if 0
only 0
implemented 0
properly, 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
salvation 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
world, 0
a 0
theme 0
he 0
never 0
left. 0

How 0
ironic 0
it 0
must 0
have 0
seemed 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
remembered 0
this 0
history 0
that 0
Ratzinger 0
would 0
himself 0
be 0
given 0
the 0
office 0
he 0
had 0
“destroyed” 0
and 0
would 0
gain 0
the 0
media-generated 0
reputation 0
as 0
an 0
“arch-conservative”. 1

And 0
it 0
starts 0
to 0
suggest 0
an 0
answer, 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
line 0
of 0
inquiry, 0
about 0
why 0
so 0
little 0
was 0
actually 0
accomplished 0
in 0
his 0
long 0
tenure. 0

With 0
the 0
“arch-conservative” 1
“Rottweiler” 1
Ratzinger 1
in 0
CDF, 0
why 0
do 0
we 0
have 0
the 0
situation 0
we 0
have 0
today? 0

What 0
did 0
he 0
do 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
explosion 0
of 0
neo-modernism 0
– 0
that 0
burned 1
like 1
an 1
unchecked 1
wildfire 1
throughout 1
the 1
Catholic 1
world 1
through 0
the 0
reign 0
of 0
John 0
Paul 0
II? 0

What 0
did 0
“silencing” 0
by 0
Ratzinger’s 0
CDF 0
do 0
to 0
stop 0
Hans 0
Kung 0
becoming 0
a 0
celebrity 1
“priest-theologian,” 1
courted 0
by 0
the 0
media 0
for 0
his 0
loathing 0
of 0
Catholicism? 0

Kung, 0
who 0
was 0
never 0
removed 0
from 0
the 0
priesthood 0
despite 0
his 0
manifest 0
heresy? 0

Can 0
we 0
think 0
of 0
any 0
other 0
names 0
who 0
were 0
corrected 0
even 0
to 0
this 0
degree? 0

Precious 0
few. 0

But 0
we 0
can 0
certainly 0
think 0
of 0
many, 0
many 0
who 0
spent 0
their 0
lives 0
and 0
vocations 0
blatantly 1
denying 1
and 1
undermining 1
the 0
Catholic 0
Faith 0
– 0
academic 0
theologians, 0
religious, 0
priests, 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
– 0
with 0
never 0
a 0
peep 0
of 0
protest 0
from 0
Rome. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
scandalous 0
pack 0
of 0
frauds 0
we 0
currently 0
have 0
in 0
the 0
episcopate 0
is 0
entirely 0
the 0
product 0
of 0
the 0
“arch-conservative” 1
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
the 0
“Rottweiler” 1
Benedict 1
XVI 1
pontificates. 0

Why 0
did 0
we 0
think 0
that 0
Ratzinger, 0
in 0
this 0
crucial 0
role 0
of 0
CDF 0
prefect, 0
was 0
a 0
bulwark 0
of 0
orthodoxy? 0

Is 0
it 0
simply 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
moved 0
so 0
far 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
ancient 0
Faith 0
that 0
we 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
a 0
realistic 0
notion 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
ourselves 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
comparison, 0
to 0
make 0
an 0
objective 0
judgement? 0

The 0
“progressive” 1
destroyer 1
of 1
Ottaviani 1
inheriting 0
his 0
office 0
and 0
the 0
epithet 0
“arch-conservative”… 1

Indeed, 0
Ratzinger 0
himself 0
maintained 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
never 0
changed 0
his 0
theological 0
opinions. 0

He 0
was 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
his 0
old 0
academic 0
colleagues 0
like 0
Kung 0
and 0
Kasper 0
who 0
had 0
moved 0
further 0
to 0
the 0
ideological 0
“left” 0
after 0
the 0
1960s 0
while 0
he 0
stayed 0
in 0
place. 0

Perhaps 0
now, 0
as 0
an 0
answer 0
that 0
fits 0
our 0
apparently 0
contradictory 0
puzzle 0
pieces, 0
we 0
can 0
finally 0
accept 0
his 0
word 0
on 0
this. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
world 0
of 0
Catholic 0
academic 0
theology 0
had 0
become 0
so 0
corrupted 0
that 0
a 1
man 1
called 1
“progressive” 1
in 0
1963, 0
but 0
whose 0
ideas 0
remained 0
the 0
same, 0
would 0
look 0
like 0
a 0
“champion 0
of 0
traditional 0
Catholic 0
orthodoxy” 0
by 0
2005. 0

Is 0
this 0
why 0
he 0
resigned? 0

Is 0
it 0
simply 0
that 0
his 0
conception 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
of 0
the 0
papacy, 0
was 0
never 0
what 0
Catholics 0
believed 0
about 0
it? 0

Perhaps 0
a 0
hint 0
at 0
the 0
answer 0
comes 0
from 0
La 0
Stampa 0
in 0
2015 0
which 0
published 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
memoirs 0
of 0
Silvano 0
Fausti, 0
SJ, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
confessor 0
and 0
spiritual 0
guide 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Martini, 0
the 0
godfather 1
of 1
the 1
“liberal” 1
European 1
Catholic 1
Church, 1
and 0
alleged 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
“Sankt 0
Gallen 0
Mafia” 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Danneels 0
admitted 0
conspired 0
for 0
years 0
against 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

Fausti 0
said 0
that 0
Benedict 0
met 0
with 0
Martini 0
at 0
the 0
bishops’ 0
palace 0
of 0
Milan 0
in 0
June 0
2012. 0

Martini, 0
Fausti 0
said, 0
urged 0
Benedict 0
to 0
resign 0
the 0
papacy. 0

Apparently 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
his 0
election 0
in 0
2005, 0
Martini 0
had 0
said 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
his 0
main 0
task 0
to 0
reform 0
the 0
Curia. 0

By 0
2012, 0
this 0
had 0
proved 0
impossible. 0

Why 0
would 0
Benedict 0
take 0
advice 0
from 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Martini 0
– 0
the 1
“godfather” 1
of 1
the 1
“liberal 1
wing” 1
of 1
European 1
Catholicism? 1

I 0
think 0
the 0
question 0
would 0
not 0
even 0
occur 0
to 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Ratzinger. 0

They 0
were 0
esteemed 0
academic 0
colleagues. 0

They 0
were 0
brothers 0
of 0
the 0
episcopate. 0

They 0
were 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
club. 0

Any 0
appearance 0
of 0
ideological 0
division 0
between 0
them 0
was, 0
in 0
essence, 0
a 0
product 0
of 0
the 0
media 0
narrative. 0

Why 0
wouldn’t 0
the 0
pope 0
take 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
his 0
most 0
respected 0
and 0
senior 0
cardinal? 0

Why 0
is 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
a 0
cardinal? 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
prominent 0
of 0
those 0
puzzle 0
pieces 0
is 0
the 0
apparent 0
inability 0
of 0
these 0
“conservative” 0
prelates, 0
to 0
detect, 0
let 0
alone 0
effectively 0
oppose, 0
these 0
brazen 1
enemies 1
of 1
the 1
Faith 1
within 0
the 0
episcopate 0
and 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals. 0

It 0
beggars 0
belief 0
of 0
ordinary 0
people 0
that, 0
after 0
so 0
many 0
years 0
of 0
hearing 0
and 0
reading 0
them, 0
Ratzinger 0
would 0
remain 0
on 0
such 0
friendly 0
terms 0
with 0
men 0
like 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
and 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Martini, 0
the 0
alleged 1
brains 1
of 1
the 1
Sankt 1
Gallen 1
Mafia. 1

When, 0
at 0
his 0
very 0
first 0
Angelus 0
address 0
in 0
2013, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
how 0
much 0
he 0
loved 0
the 0
writing 0
of 0
Walter 0
Kasper, 0
quite 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
had 0
spent 0
many 0
years 0
watching 0
the 0
Vatican 0
started 0
understanding 0
where 0
we 0
were 0
all 0
headed 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
pope. 0

Jorge 0
Bergoglio 0
might 0
have 0
been 0
unknown 0
to 0
the 0
larger 0
Catholic 0
world, 0
but 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
was 0
a 0
celebrity 1
heretic, 1
the 0
media-savvy 1
frontman 1
for 1
the 1
“ultra-liberal” 1
“wing” 1
of 0
the 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
Church. 0

In 0
an 0
article 0
on 0
the 0
cardinal’s 0
life’s 0
work, 0
Thomas 0
Jansen, 0
the 0
editor-in-chief 0
of 0
Katholisch.de, 0
recently 0
noted 0
that 0
Walter 0
Kasper 0
could 0
not 0
possibly 0
have 0
done 0
the 0
damage 0
he 0
has 0
without 0
the 0
direct 0
assistance 0
of 0
both 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

The 0
monstrous 0
debacle 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
is 0
as 0
much 0
Kasper’s 0
work 0
as 0
Bergoglio’s. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
has, 0
for 0
40 0
years, 0
never 0
troubled 0
to 0
hide 0
his 0
heterodox 0
opinions 0
and 0
has 0
devoted 0
much 0
of 0
his 0
life 0
to 0
a 0
campaign 0
to 0
bring 0
about 0
precisely 0
this 0
outcome. 0

Jansen 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
Kasper 0
had 0
already 0
tried 0
to 0
bring 0
out 0
the 0
same 0
proposal 0
for 0
Communion 0
for 0
divorced 0
and 0
remarried 0
in 0
1993, 0
together 0
with 0
Karl 0
Lehmann, 0
another 1
“Sankt 1
Gallen” 1
member. 1

This 0
was 0
stopped 0
by 0
Ratzinger 0
and 0
the 0
CDF. 0

But 0
that 0
raises 0
the 0
next 0
question; 0
if 0
Ratzinger 0
knew 0
so 0
well 0
what 1
kind 1
of 1
creature 1
Kasper 1
was, 1
why 0
wasn’t 0
the 0
next 0
step 0
to 0
pitch 0
him 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
episcopate 0
on 0
his 0
ear? 0

Why 0
was 0
he 0
not 0
– 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
least 0
– 0
given 0
the 0
same 0
“silencing” 0
treatment 0
as 0
Kung? 0

Kasper 0
has 0
recently 0
gone 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
again 0
to 0
complain 0
of 0
being 0
called 0
a 0
heretic. 0

But 0
it’s 0
a 0
simple 0
truth: 0
he’s 1
a 1
heretic. 1

Everyone 0
knows 0
he’s 0
a 0
heretic 0
because 0
we 0
have 0
heard 0
him 0
trumpeting 1
in 1
his 1
blatant 1
heresies 1
from 1
every 1
rooftop 1
he 1
could 1
find 1
for 0
decades. 0

After 0
openly 0
working 0
against 0
the 0
Faith, 0
instead 0
of 0
being 0
demoted, 0
silenced, 0
laicised 0
and/or 0
excommunicated, 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
made 0
him 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

Remember 0
that 0
his 0
scheme 0
to 0
Amoris-Latitia-ize 0
the 0
Church 0
was 0
stopped 0
by 0
Ratzinger’s 0
CDF 0
in 0
1993. 0

But 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
demoted, 0
reprimanded 0
or 0
corrected 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

Nor 0
was 0
he 0
removed 0
from 0
places 0
of 0
influence. 0

Far 0
from 0
it. 0

In 0
1994 0
Kasper 0
was 0
inserted 0
into 0
the 0
Vatican 0
Curia 0
by 0
being 0
named 0
co-chair 0
of 0
the 0
International 0
Commission 0
for 0
Lutheran-Catholic 0
Dialogue. 0

In 0
1999, 0
he 0
made 0
another 0
step 0
up, 0
being 0
appointed 0
secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council 0
for 0
Promoting 0
Christian 0
Unity, 0
the 0
“ecumenical” 0
office 0
where 0
his 0
manifest 0
religious 0
indifferentism 0
could 0
be 0
given 0
free 0
reign. 0

In 0
2001, 0
he 0
was 0
made 0
a 0
Cardinal-deacon 0
with 0
the 0
awesome 1
responsibility 1
of 0
voting 0
in 0
a 0
Conclave. 0

Then 0
Benedict 0
allowed 0
him 0
to 0
remain 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

And, 0
as 0
if 0
to 0
add 0
a 0
finishing 1
touch 1
to 1
the 1
poisoned 1
cake 1
that 0
is 0
Ratzinger’s 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
creation 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Catholic 0
Paradigm, 0
Benedict 0
is 0
now 0
being 0
said 0
to 0
have 0
deliberately 0
timed 0
his 0
resignation 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
allow 0
his 0
old 0
academic 0
colleague 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
the 0
2013 0
Conclave. 0

As 0
Jansen 0
pointed 0
out, 0
and 0
Maike 0
Hickson 0
quoted 0
in 0
a 0
piece 0
for 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five, 0

Cardinal 0
Kasper 0
barely 0
even 0
made 0
it 0
into 0
the 0
last 0
conclave, 0
because 0
he 0
had 0
just 0
turned 0
80 0
years 0
of 0
age. 0

But 0
since 0
the 0
date 0
of 0
the 0
death 0
(or 0
abdication, 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
case 0
in 0
2013) 0
of 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
decisive, 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
able 0
to 0
attend 0
and 0
vote 0
in 0
that 0
election. 0

(As 0
some 0
observers 0
noted, 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
generous 0
gesture 0
toward 0
Cardinal 0
Kasper 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
had 0
decided 0
to 0
retire 0
in 0
due 0
time.) 0

Excuse 0
me 0
Maike, 0
but 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
parenthetical 0
issue. 0

Is 1
it 1
any 1
wonder 1
that 1
so 1
many 1
Catholics 1
have 1
become 1
disaffected? 1

Cardinal 0
Ratzinger, 0
Pope 0
“Emeritus” 0
Benedict 0
– 0
whatever 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
call 1
yourself 1
– 0
I 0
have 0
one 0
question 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
really 0
like 0
you 0
to 0
answer: 0
Why 1
is 1
this 1
man 1
still 1
a 1
cardinal? 1

Why 1
is 1
he 1
still 1
a 1
bishop? 1

Why 1
is 1
he 1
still 1
allowed 1
to 1
call 1
himself 1
a 1
“Catholic 1
theologian”? 1

Why 1
did 1
you, 1
apparently 1
deliberately, 1
ensure 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
able 1
to 1
enter 1
the 1
Conclave 1
to 1
decide 1
who 1
your 1
successor 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
be? 1

Doesn’t 0
anyone 0
else 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
this? 0

Don’t 0
we 0
all 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
Hans 0
Kung 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
priest? 0

Why 0
was 0
Cardinal 0
Mahony 0
allowed 0
to 0
retire 0
in 0
good 0
standing? 0

Why 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Weakland, 0
the 0
active 1
homosexual 1
who 0
paid 0
off 0
his 0
ex-lover, 0
was 0
not 0
excommunicated? 0

What 0
are 0
the 0
names 0
we 0
all 0
remember, 0
just 0
off 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
our 0
heads? 0

My 0
own 0
bishop 0
in 0
Victoria, 0
the 0
occultist 0
Remi 0
de 0
Roo, 0
Seattle’s 0
Raymond 0
Hunthausen, 0
Miami’s 0
Favalora, 0
Rochester’s 0
Matthew 0
Clark, 0
Derek 0
Worlock 0
of 0
Liverpool… 0
I 0
sometimes 0
wonder 0
how 0
long 0
that 0
list 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
when 0
this 0
is 0
all 0
over. 0

For 0
fifty 0
years 0
Catholics 0
have 0
wanted 0
to 0
know 0
why 0
nothing 0
was 0
ever 0
done, 0
as 0
these 0
wolves 1
in 1
the 1
episcopate 1
were 0
allowed, 0
year 0
after 0
year 0
to 0
continue 0
attacking 0
the 0
Church. 0

Why 1
have 1
we 1
so 1
often 1
seen 1
these 1
men 1
– 1
compromised 1
intellectually 1
and 1
morally 1
– 1
elevated 1
to 1
superior 1
rank, 1
despite 1
the 1
incredible 1
brazenness 1
of 1
their 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Faith? 1

The 0
end 0
of 0
“Big 0
Umbrella 0
Catholicism” 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times’ 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
is 0
among 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
ask 0
these 0
kinds 0
of 0
questions. 0

Maike 0
Hickson 0
quotes 0
him, 0
writing 0
of 0
this 0
bizarre 0
situation 0
– 0
in 0
which 0
each, 0
of 0
the 0
so-called 0
“Sankt 1
Gallen 1
Mafia” 1
prelates, 1
including 0
Kasper, 0
who 0
openly 0
campaigned 0
for 0
the 0
effective 0
abolition 0
of 0
Catholic 0
moral 0
teaching: 0
“It 0
was 0
characteristic 0
of 0
the 0
church’s 0
effective 0
truce 0
[between 0
conservatives 0
and 0
progressivists] 0
that 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
himself 0
had 0
given 0
most 0
of 0
them 0
their 0
red 0
hats, 0
elevating 0
them 0
despite 0
their 0
disagreement 0
with 0
his 0
restorationist 0
approach.” 0

When 0
journalists 0
talk 0
about 0
Catholicism, 0
they 0
often 0
speak 0
of 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Kasper 0
being 0
– 0
as 0
his 0
Wikipedia 0
page 0
puts 0
it 0
– 0
“one 1
of 1
the 1
main 1
figures 1
of 1
the 1
liberal 1
wing 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church.” 1
And 0
this 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
make 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
sense 0
to 0
Catholics, 0
we’re 0
supposed 0
to 0
accept 0
it 0
as 0
the 0
reality 0
of 0
our 0
times. 0

There’s 0
a 0
“liberal 0
wing” 0
and 0
a 0
“conservative 0
wing” 0
and 0
they’re 0
both 0
Catholic. 0

Steve 0
Skojec 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
our 0
willingness 0
to 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
whole 0
“emeritus 1
pope” 1
charade 1
was 0
an 0
error: 0
“I 0
think 0
the 0
problem 0
is 0
that 0
we 0
all 0
went 0
along 0
with 0
their 0
game 0
of 0
make 0
believe, 0
and 0
we 0
shouldn’t 0
have.” 0
In 0
fact, 0
I 0
am 0
starting 0
to 0
think 0
that 0
the 0
willingness 0
of 0
most 0
Catholics 0
to 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
entire 0
charade 1
of 1
post-conciliar 1
Catholicism 1
has 0
been 0
a 0
grave 0
error. 0

By 0
playing 0
along, 0
by 0
pretending 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
be 0
“conservative 0
Catholics” 0
in 0
this 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
that 0
also 0
includes 0
“liberal 0
Catholics” 0
we 0
have 0
helped 0
them 0
perpetrate 0
one 0
the 0
most 0
monstrous 0
frauds 0
in 0
human 0
history. 0

Because 0
of 0
this 0
schizophrenic 1
mindset 1
of 1
the 1
Church’s 1
leadership 1
since 0
1965, 0
we 0
have 0
all 0
come 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
underlying 0
premise; 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
a 0
“big 0
umbrella” 0
with 0
plenty 0
of 0
room 0
for 0
people 0
of 0
all 0
personal 0
opinions, 0
that 0
such 0
issues 0
as 0
liturgy 0
are 0
matters 0
of 0
personal 0
“taste” 0
…that 0
two 0
opposed 0
things 0
can 0
both 0
be 0
Catholic 0
truth. 0

This 0
schizophrenia 1
is 0
the 0
model 0
under 0
which 0
“conservatives” 0
have 0
operated 0
all 0
this 0
time, 0
and 0
by 0
which 0
they 0
have 0
judged 0
a 0
man 0
like 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
“conservative 1
champion 1
of 1
orthodoxy.” 1
And 0
what 0
has 0
this 0
achieved? 0

It 0
created 0
cover 0
for 0
the 0
men 0
of 0
Kasper’s 0
clique 0
to 0
maneuver 0
their 0
man 0
on 0
the 0
throne 0
of 0
Peter 0
five 0
years 0
ago. 0

And 0
just 0
like 0
that, 0
the 0
jargon 0
of 0
“tolerance” 0
and 0
the 0
“big 0
umbrella” 0
is 0
over 0
and 0
the 0
purge 0
of 0
faithful, 0
believing 0
Catholic 0
religious, 0
seminarians, 0
priests, 0
and 0
academics 0
has 0
begun. 0

As 0
it 0
had 0
to. 0

They, 0
at 0
least, 0
do 0
not 0
harbour 0
this 0
insane 0
contradiction, 0
and 0
understand 0
– 0
and 0
frequently 0
say 0
out 0
loud 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
and 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
are 0
not 0
the 0
same. 0

And 0
their 0
New 0
Church 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
left. 0

For 0
five 0
decades 0
we 1
played 1
the 1
Anglican 1
game; 1
as 0
long 0
as 0
we 0
don’t 0
talk 0
about 0
it, 0
there 0
isn’t 0
a 0
problem. 0

Ottaviani’s 0
Holy 0
Office 0
and 0
schema 0
were 0
the 1
last 1
gasp 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
Church 1
– 0
and 0
as 0
de 0
Lubac 0
said 0
above, 0
it 0
was 0
killed 0
by 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger. 0

We 0
had 0
a 0
long 0
hiatus 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
popes 0
pretended 0
nothing 0
essential 0
had 0
changed, 0
while 0
the 0
institution 0
around 0
them 0
fell 0
to 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm, 0
until 0
the 0
papacy 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
left. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
I’ve 0
been 0
saying 0
is 0
a 0
blessing 0
in 0
disguise, 0
and 0
an 0
enormous 0
relief, 0
about 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
era 0
is 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
finally 0
leave 0
behind 0
us 0
the 0
absurd 0
situation 0
of 0
the 0
Wojtyla/Ratzinger 0
era. 0

We 0
were 0
expected 0
for 0
all 0
those 0
years 0
to 0
pretend 0
we 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
“New 0
Springtime 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II,” 0
while 0
we 0
watched 0
these 0
wolves 1
in 1
shepherds’ 1
clothing 1
eating 1
the 1
sheep. 1

Now 0
we 0
can, 0
at 0
least, 0
finally 0
stop 0
pretending 0
that 0
everything 0
is 0
just 0
dandy 0
under 0
the 0
New 1
Paradigm 1
of 1
Merciful 1
Conciliar 1
Wonderfulness. 1

For 0
those 0
still 0
wondering, 0
Bergoglio 0
isn’t 0
a 0
shock, 0
he 0
isn’t 0
even 0
a 0
surprise; 0
he’s 0
just 0
the 0
logical 0
end 0
result. 0

This 0
pontificate 0
isn’t 0
an 0
anomaly; 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
possible 0
outcome, 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
as 0
much 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger 0
as 0
Walter 0
Kasper. 0

Trump 0
calls 0
on 0
Sessions 0
to 0
stop 0
Mueller’s 0
Russia 0
probe, 0
raising 0
specter 0
of 0
attempted 0
obstruction 0

WASHINGTON 0
— 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
called 0
on 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
to 0
“stop 0
this 1
Rigged 1
Witch 1
Hunt 1
right 0
now,” 0
opening 0
the 0
president 0
to 0
further 0
complaints 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
trying 0
to 0
obstruct 0
the 0
investigation 0
into 0
Russia’s 0
election 0
interference 0
and 0
his 0
campaign’s 0
possible 0
complicity. 0

Trump 0
is 0
already 0
reportedly 0
under 0
investigation 0
for 0
potential 0
obstruction 0
of 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe 0
led 0
by 0
special 0
counsel 0
Robert 0
S. 0
Mueller 0
III. 0

The 0
tweet 0
early 0
Wednesday 0
was 0
the 1
president’s 1
most 1
explicit 1
post 1
or 1
statement 1
to 1
date 1
seemingly 0
aimed 0
at 0
getting 0
his 0
attorney 0
general, 0
the 0
nation’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officer, 0
to 0
end 0
the 0
probe 0

The 0
tweet, 0
along 0
with 0
several 0
others 0
Wednesday 0
morning, 0
accelerated 0
the 0
president’s 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
investigation, 0
which 0
he 0
claims 0
is 0
tainted 1
by 1
bias. 1

They 0
were 0
likely 0
prompted 0
by 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
the 0
trial 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
of 0
Paul 0
Manafort, 0
Trump’s 0
former 0
campaign 0
chairman, 0
on 0
18 0
charges 0
of 0
tax 0
evasion, 0
bank 0
fraud 0
and 0
conspiracy. 0

“This 1
is 1
a 1
terrible 1
situation 1
and 1
Attorney 1
General 1
Jeff 1
Sessions 1
should 1
stop 1
this 1
Rigged 1
Witch 1
Hunt 1
right 1
now, 1
before 1
it 1
continues 1
to 1
stain 1
our 1
country 1
any 1
further. 1

Bob 1
Mueller 1

totally 1
conflicted, 1
and 1
his 1
17 1
Angry 1
Democrats 1
that 1
are 1
doing 1
his 1
dirty 1
work 1
are 1
a 1
disgrace 1
to 1
USA!” 1
Trump 0
wrote. 0

The 0
president 0
suggested 0
in 0
a 0
subsequent 0
tweet 0
that 0
Manafort 1
was 1
being 1
treated 1
worse 1

Trump’s 0
tweets 0
prompted 0
Rep. 0
Adam 0
B. 0
Schiff 0
of 0
California, 0
the 0
top 0
Democrat 0
on 0
the 0
House 0
Intelligence 0
Committee, 0
to 0
accuse 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
obstruction 0
“hiding 1
in 1
plain 1
sight.” 1

“The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
just 0
called 0
on 0
his 0
Attorney 0
General 0
to 0
put 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
an 0
investigation 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
President, 0
his 0
family 0
and 0

may 0
be 0
implicated,” 0
Schiff 0
tweeted. 0

“This 1
is 1
an 1
attempt 1
to 1
obstruct 1
justice 1
hiding 1
in 1
plain 1
sight. 1

America 1
must 1
never 1
accept 1
it.” 1

Although 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
said 0
that 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
are 0
official 0
presidential 0
statements, 0
his 0
lawyer, 0
Rudolph 0
W. 0
Giuliani, 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
latest 0
one 0
as 0
he 0
has 0
before, 0
by 0
brushing 0
off 0
suggestions 0
that 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
as 0
evidence 0
of 0
obstruction. 0

“The 0
president 0
was 0
expressing 0
his 0
opinion 0
on 0
his 0
favored 0
medium 0
for 0
asserting 0
his 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right 0
of 0
free 0
speech,” 0
Giuliani 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
interview. 0

“He 0
said 0
‘should,’ 0
not 0
‘must,’ 0
and 0
no 0
presidential 0
order 0
was 0
issued 0
or 0
will 0
be.” 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
spoke 0
with 0
Trump 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
wasn’t 0
actually 0
issuing 0
an 0
order. 0

“I 0
talked 0
to 0
him 0
about 0
it 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
same 0
page 0
as 0
we 0
are,” 0
Giuliani 0
said, 0
and 0
the 0
president 0
indicated 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
ordering 0
Sessions 0
to 0
act. 0

On 0
Sunday, 0
Giuliani 0
told 0
CBS’ 0
“Face 0
the 0
Nation”: 0
“Obstruction 0
by 0
tweet 0
is 0
not 0
something 0
I 0
think 0
works 0
real 0
well. 0

Generally 0
obstruction 0
is 0
secret, 0
it’s 0
clandestine, 0
it’s 0
corrupt.” 0

Giuliani 0
added, 0
“I’ve 1
looked 1
at 1
all 1
those 1
tweets 1
and 1
they 1
don’t 1
amount 1
to 1
anything.” 1

For 0
months, 0
Trump’s 0
lawyers 0
also 0
have 0
argued 0
that 0
it’s 0
impossible 0
for 0
the 0
president 0
to 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
because 0
his 0
constitutional 0
authority 0
extends 0
over 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

That 0
power 0
allows 0
him 0
to 0
direct 0
officials 0
where 0
to 0
focus 0
their 0
resources 0
or 0
to 0
fire 0
them 0
when 0
he 0
chooses, 0
as 0
Trump 0
did 0
when 0
removing 0
James 0
B. 0
Comey 0
as 0
FBI 0
director 0
last 0
year. 0

That 0
firing, 0
however, 0
led 0
to 0
Mueller’s 0
appointment 0
as 0
special 0
counsel. 0

Wednesday’s 0
tweet 0
was 0
a 0
reminder 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
unabated 1
anger 1
at 0
Sessions, 0
who 0
recused 0
himself 0
from 0
overseeing 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
on 0
March 0
2, 0
2017 0
— 0
as 0
members 0
of 0
both 0
parties 0
and 0
legal 0
experts 0
have 0
contended 0
that 0
he 0
should. 0

Sessions 0
pointed 0
to 0
Justice 0
Department 0
regulations 0
to 0
explain 0
that, 0
as 0
one 1
of 1
Trump’s 1
earliest 1
and 1
most 1
active 1
supporters, 1
he 0
shouldn’t 0
participate 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign. 0

He 0
announced 0
the 0
decision 0
after 0
controversy 0
over 0
his 0
own 0
undisclosed 0
contacts, 0
both 0
during 0
the 0
campaign 0
and 0
the 0
post-election 0
transition, 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 0
ambassador 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
Sergey 0
Kislyak. 0

Two 1
months 1
ago, 1
Trump 1
tweeted 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
have 1
chosen 1
a 1
different 1
person 1
as 1
attorney 1
general 1
who 1
wouldn’t 1
have 1
needed 1
to 1
recuse 1
himself. 1

“I 1
wish 1
I 1
did!” 1
he 1
wrote. 1

In 1
his 1
tweets, 1
Trump 1
also 1
quoted 1
criticism 1
of 1
the 1
investigation 1
from 1
Alan 1
Dershowitz, 1
a 1
Harvard 1
Law 1
School 1
professor 1
who 1
frequently 1
defends 1
Trump 1
on 1
television. 1

In 1
an 1
interview 1
with 1
the 1
Los 1
Angeles 1
Times, 1
Dershowitz 1
said 1
he 1
does 1
not 1
believe 1
Sessions 1
has 1
the 1
authority 1
to 1
end 1
the 1
probe. 1

“You 1
can’t 1
be 1
both 1
recused 1
and 1
making 1
decisions 1
about 1
the 1
investigation,” 1
he 1
said. 1

But 0
Dershowitz 0
also 0
cast 0
doubt 0
on 0
whether 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
obstruction. 0

“You 0
cannot 0
obstruct 0
justice 0
by 0
openly 0
exercising 0
your 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights 0
and 0
openly 0
criticizing 0
a 0
prosecution, 0
whether 0
you’re 0
right 0
or 0
wrong,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Obstruction 0
of 0
justice 0
is 0
generally 0
committed 0
behind 0
the 0
scenes, 0
so 0
I 0
think 0
both 0
sides 0
are 0
a 0
little 0
overwrought 0
here.” 0

Stephen 0
Vladeck, 0
a 0
University 0
of 0
Texas 0
law 0
professor, 0
agreed 0
that 0
Sessions 0
cannot 0
stop 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
given 0
that 0
he 0
recused 0
himself. 0

“The 0
president, 0
intentionally 0
or 0
not, 0
is 0
misdirecting 1
his 1
ire,” 1
Vladeck 0
said. 0

If 0
Trump 0
wanted 0
to 0
use 0
his 0
power 0
to 0
end 0
the 0
probe, 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
order 0
to 0
Rod 0
J. 0
Rosenstein, 0
the 0
deputy 0
attorney 0
general 0
supervising 0
the 0
Mueller 0
team’s 0
work, 0
and 0
fire 0
Rosenstein 0
if 0
he 0
does 0
not 0
comply, 0
according 0
to 0
Vladeck. 0

Trump 0
could 0
also 0
try 0
to 0
replace 0
Sessions 0
as 0
attorney 0
general 0
with 0
someone 0
who 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
a 0
conflict 0
of 0
interest 0
from 0
the 0
campaign, 0
allowing 0
that 0
person 0
to 0
relieve 0
Rosenstein 0
of 0
the 0
responsibility 0
to 0
oversee 0

Kavanaugh's 0
Nomination 0
Saved? 0

Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
outstanding 0
performance 0
at 0
yesterday’s 0
evidentiary 0
hearing 0
featuring 0
attempted 0
rape 0
accuser 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
may 0
have 0
revived 0
his 0
embattled 0
nomination 0
for 0
the 0
highest 0
court 0
in 0
America. 0

The 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
showed 0
the 0
underhanded 0
tactics 0
employed 0
by 0
the 0
Left 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

The 0
nominee 0
and 0
Republican 0
senators 0
used 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
attack 0
desperate 0
Democrats 0
for 0
their 0
efforts 0
at 0
character 1
assassination. 1

President 0
Trump 0
was 0
delighted. 0

“Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
showed 0
America 0
exactly 0
why 0
I 0
nominated 0
him[,]” 0
President 0
Trump 0
tweeted 0
at 0
6:46 0
p.m. 0
after 0
the 0
hearing 0
wrapped 0
up. 0

“His 0
testimony 0
was 0
powerful, 0
honest, 0
and 0
riveting. 0

Democrats’ 0
search 1
and 1
destroy 1
strategy 1
is 0
disgraceful 0
and 0
this 0
process 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
total 1
sham 1
and 0
effort 0
to 0
delay, 0
obstruct, 0
and 0
resist. 0

The 1
Senate 1
must 1
vote!” 1

Ford, 0
who 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh 0
tried 0
to 0
rape 0
her 0
decades 0
ago 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
student, 0
appeared 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
for 0
several 0
hours 0
Thursday. 0

Kavanaugh 0
testified 0
separately 0
after 0
Ford’s 0
testimony 0
concluded. 0

Kavanaugh 1
stole 1
the 1
show. 1

The 0
judge 0
forcefully 0
stood 0
up 0
for 0
himself 0
as 0
his 0
voice 0
trembled 1
with 1
righteous 1
indignation, 1
calling 0
out 0
Democratic 0
senators 0
for 0
plotting 0
against 0
him. 0

The 0
behavior 0
of 0
several 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
members 0
of 0
this 0
committee 0
at 0
my 0
hearing 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
ago 0
was 0
an 0
embarrassment. 0

But 0
at 0
least 0
it 0
was 0
just 0
a 0
good 0
old-fashioned 0
attempt 0
at 0
Borking. 0

Those 0
efforts 0
didn't 0
work. 0

When 0
I 0
did 0
at 0
least 0
okay 0
enough 0
at 0
the 0
hearings 0
that 0
it 0
looked 0
like 0
I 0
might 0
actually 0
get 0
confirmed, 0
a 0
new 0
tactic 0
was 0
needed. 0

Some 0
of 0
you 0
were 0
lying 0
in 0
wait 0
and 0
had 0
it 0
ready. 0

This 0
first 0
allegation 0
was 0
held 0
in 0
secret 0
for 0
weeks 0
by 0
a 0
Democratic 0
member 0
of 0
this 0
committee, 0
and 0
by 0
staff. 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
needed 0
only 0
if 0
you 0
couldn't 0
take 0
me 0
out 0
on 0
the 0
merits. 0

When 0
it 0
was 0
needed, 0
this 0
allegation 0
was 0
unleashed 0
and 0
publicly 0
deployed 0
over 0
Dr. 0
Ford's 0
wishes. 0

And 0
then, 0
and 1
then 1
as 0
no 0
doubt 0
was 0
expected, 0
if 0
not 0
planned, 0
came 0
a 0
long 0
series 0
of 0
false 0
last-minute 1
smears 1
designed 0
to 0
scare 0
me 0
and 0
drive 0
me 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
before 0
any 0
hearing 0
occurred. 0

Afraid 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
shadows, 1
committee 0
Republicans 0
didn’t 0
relish 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
their 0
all-male 1
team 1
of 0
11 0
senators 0
questioning 0
a 0
woman 0
so 0
they 0
hired 0
sex-crimes 0
prosecutor 0
Rachel 0
Mitchell 0
of 0
Maricopa 0
County, 0
Arizona, 0
to 0
examine 0
Ford. 0

Opinions 0
differ 0
widely 0
on 0
how 0
Mitchell 0
performed. 0

She 0
tiptoed 0
around 0
the 0
alleged 0
sexual 0
assault 0
itself, 0
instead 0
focusing 0
on 0
process-related 0
questions, 0
presumably 0
in 0
an 0
effort 0
to 0
show 0
undecided 0
senators 0
how 0
Ford 0
and 0
her 0
handlers 0
have 0
been 0
unfairly 0
manipulating 0
the 0
process. 0

In 0
much 0
of 0
her 0
testimony, 0
Ford 0
came 0
across 0
as 0
presentable 0
and 0
seemingly 0
credible, 0
though 0
vague 0
and 0
sometimes 0
evasive, 0
her 0
ridiculous 1
overall 1
story 1
notwithstanding. 0

Ford 0
did 0
well 0
enough 0
that 0
during 0
the 0
break 0
between 0
her 0
testimony 0
and 0
Kavanaugh’s, 0
commentators 0
on 0
Fox 0
News 0
such 0
as 0
Brit 0
Hume 0
and 0
Andrew 0
Napolitano 0
were 0
openly 0
musing 0
about 0
the 0
nominee 0
withdrawing, 0
opinions 0
that 0
were 0
sharply 0
reversed 0
after 0
the 0
nominee 0
completed 0
his 0
testimony 0
hours 0
later. 0

It’s 0
not 0
that 0
Mitchell 0
did 0
a 0
bad 0
job 0
creating 0
an 0
inventory 0
of 0
the 0
irregularities 0
in 0
the 0
process 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
odd 0
behavior 0
of 0
Ford 0
and 0
her 0
lawyers. 0

She 0
could 0
do 0
little 0
else. 0

She 0
had 0
many 0
restrictions 0
placed 0
upon 0
her 0
and 0
was 0
only 0
allowed 0
to 0
question 0
Ford 0
for 0
minutes 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
before 0
surrendering 0
the 0
floor 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
committee 0
Democrat. 0

As 0
commentator 0
Sean 0
Davis 0
tweeted: 0

“Hard 1
to 1
do 1
much 1
else 1
when 1
the 1
witness 1
conveniently 1
has 1
no 1
corroborating 1
evidence, 1
no 1
memory 1
of 1
any 1
verifiable 1
facts 1
of 1
what 1
happened, 1
and 1
everyone 1
she 1
says 1
was 1
present 1
at 1
the 1
alleged 1
incident--even 1
her 1
best 1
friend--has 1
denied 1
it.” 1

Nonetheless, 0
Mitchell’s 0
questioning 0
came 0
across 0
at 0
times 0
as 0
perfunctory, 0
leading 0
many 0
observers 0
to 0
conclude 0
that 0
Republicans 0
threw 0
away 0
a 0
valuable 0
opportunity 0
by 0
using 0
her 0
as 0
a 0
stand-in. 0

She 0
failed 0
to 0
lay 0
a 0
glove 0
on 0
a 0
witness 0
whose 0
implausible, 0
internally 0
contradictory 0
story 0
cried 1
out 1
for 1
vigorous 1
cross-examination. 1

In 0
the 0
end 0
the 0
too-deferential, 0
easygoing 0
Mitchell 0
failed 0
to 0
provide 0
much, 0
if 0
anything, 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
evidence 0
against 0
Ford 0
or 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Whether 0
her 0
work 0
will 0
bring 0
over 0
fence-sitting 0
senators 0
to 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
side 0
remains 0
to 0
be 0
seen. 0

Like 0
other 0
Democrats, 0
Sen. 0
Mazie 0
Hirono 0
of 0
Hawaii 0
tried 0
to 0
help 0
Ford, 0
lobbing 1
her 1
softballs. 1

After 0
saying 0
she 0
thought 0
she 0
knew 0
what 0
Mitchell 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
at 0
in 0
her 0
questions, 0
the 0
senator 0
said, 0
“so 0
I'll 0
just 0
ask 0
you 0
very 0
plainly, 0
Dr. 0
Ford, 0
is 1
there 1
a 1
political 1
motivation 1
for 1
your 1
coming 1
forward 1
with 1
your 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
assault 1
by 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh?” 1

“No, 0
and 0
I'd 0
like 0
to 0
reiterate 0
that 0
again, 0
I 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
information 0
to 0
you 0
while 0
there 0
was 0
still 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
other 0
what 0
looked 0
like 0
equally-qualified 0
candidates,” 0
Ford 0
replied. 0

When 0
Sen. 0
Dick 0
Durbin 0
(D-Ill.) 0
asked 0
Ford 0
“with 0
what 0
degree 0
of 0
certainty 0
do 0
you 0
believe 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
assaulted 0
you?” 0
Ford 0
replied, 0
“one 0
hundred 0
percent.” 0

Strangely, 0
Ford 1
has 1
a 1
bad 1
long-term 1
memory 1
and 1
a 1
bad 1
short-term 1
memory. 1

She 0
doesn’t 0
know 0
when 0
or 0
where 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
took 0
place, 0
yet 0
she 0
is 0
“one 0
hundred 0
percent” 0
certain 0
it 0
was 0
Kavanaugh 0
who 0
attacked 0
her. 0

At 0
the 0
outset 0
of 0
the 0
hearing, 0
Grassley 0
provided 0
an 0
overview 0
of 0
what 0
Kavanaugh 0
had 0
gone 0
through 0
–including 0
the 0
Democrats’ 0
sordid 0
behavior— 0
since 0
President 0
Trump 0
announced 0
the 0
judge’s 0
nomination 0
on 0
July 0
9. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process, 0
Kavanaugh 0
endured 0
his 0
sixth 0
background 0
investigation 0
since 0
1993. 0

“Nowhere 0
in 0
any 0
of 0
these 0
six 0
FBI 0
reports, 0
which 0
committee 0
investigators 0
have 0
reviewed 0
on 0
a 0
bipartisan 0
basis, 0
was 0
there 0
a 0
whiff 0
of 0
any 0
issue 0
– 0
any 1
issue 1
at 0
all 0
related 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
to 0
inappropriate 0
sexual 0
behavior,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

Ford 0
shared 0
her 0
allegations 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
committee’s 0
ranking 0
member, 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
(D-Calif.), 0
in 0
the 0
summer. 0

The 0
letter 0
remained 0
secret 0
from 0
July 0
30 0
through 0
until 0
September 0
13 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
learned 0
about 0
it, 0
the 0
chairman 0
said. 0

Instead 0
of 0
sharing 0
the 0
letter 0
with 0
the 0
committee, 0
Feinstein 0
did 0
nothing. 0

Before 0
the 0
hearing, 0
Kavanaugh 0
met 0
privately 0
with 0
65 0
senators, 0
including 0
Feinstein, 0
who 0
didn’t 0
ask 0
him 0
about 0
the 0
allegations 0
when 0
she 0
met 0
with 0
him 0
in 0
August. 0

The 0
committee 0
held 0
a 0
four-day 0
public 0
hearing 0
from 0
September 0
4 0
to 0
September 0
7 0
during 0
which 0
Kavanaugh 0
testified 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
32 0
hours 0
in 0
public. 0

Feinstein 0
didn’t 0
attend 0
it, 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

Kavanaugh 0
answered 0
almost 0
1,300 0
written 0
questions 0
senators 0
submitted 0
after 0
the 0
hearing. 0

That 0
is 0
“more 0
than 0
all 0
prior 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominees,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Throughout 0
this 0
period, 0
we 0
did 0
not 0
know 0
about 0
the 0
ranking 0
member's 0
secret 0
evidence. 0

Then, 0
only 0
at 0
an 0
11th 0
hour, 0
on 0
the 0
eve 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh's 0
confirmation 0
vote, 0
did 0
the 0
ranking 0
member 0
refer 0
the 0
allegations 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

And 0
then, 0
sadly, 0
the 0
allegations 0
were 0
leaked 0
to 0
the 0
press.” 0

“Every 0
step 0
of 0
the 0
way 0
the 0
Democratic 0
side 0
refused 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
what 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
bipartisan 0
investigation,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

After 0
Ford’s 0
identity 0
became 0
public, 0
Grassley’s 0
staff 0
“contacted 0
all 0
the 0
individuals 0
she 0
said 0
attended 0
the 0
1982 0
party 0
described 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Kavanaugh 0
“immediately 0
submitted 0
to 0
an 0
interview 0
under 0
penalty 0
of 0
felony 0
for 0
any 0
knowingly 0
false 0
statements. 0

He 0
denied 0
the 0
allegations 0
categorically.” 0

“Democratic 0
staff 0
was 0
invited 0
to 0
participate 0
and 0
could 0
have 0
asked 0
any 0
questions 0
they 0
wanted 0
to, 0
but 0
they 0
declined. 0

Which 0
leads 0
me 0
then 0
to 0
wonder: 0
If 1
they're 1
really 1
concerned 1
with 1
going 1
to 1
the 1
truth, 1
why 1
wouldn't 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
the 1
accused?” 1

Grassley 0
said 0
his 0
staff 0
contacted 0
the 0
other 0
individuals 0
who 0
allegedly 0
attended 0
the 0
party 0
at 0
which 0
the 0
conduct 0
Ford 0
complained 0
of 0
allegedly 0
took 0
place: 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
Patrick 0
Smyth, 0
and 0
Leland 0
Keyser. 0

“All 0
three 0
submitted 0
statements 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
under 0
– 0
under 0
penalty 0
of 0
felony, 0
denying 0
any 0

Dr. 0
Ford. 0

Dr. 0
Ford's 0
lifelong 0
friend, 0
Dr. 0
– 0
Miss 0
Keyser, 0
stated 0
she 0
doesn't 0
know 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
doesn't 0
recall 0
ever 0
attending 0
a 0
party 0
with 0
him.” 0

Grassley 0
said 0
his 0
staff 0
repeatedly 0
sought 0
to 0
interview 0
Ford 0
over 0
the 0
past 0
11 0
days, 0
“even 0
volunteering 0
to 0
fly 0
to 0
California 0
to 0
take 0
her 0
testimony, 0
but 0
her 0
attorneys 0
refused 0
to 0
prevent 0
– 0
present 0
her 0
allegations 0
to 0
Congress.” 0

“Consistent 0
with 0
their 0
stated 0
desires 0
to 0
obstruct 0
Kavanaugh's 0
nomination” 0
by 0
any 0
means 0
possible, 0
“pushed 0
for 0
FBI 0
investigations 0
into 0
the 0
allegations.” 0

“We've 0
been 0
trying 0
to 0
investigate 0
other 0
allegations,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

“At 0
this 0
time, 0
we 0
have 0
not 0
had 0
cooperation 0
from 0
attorneys 0
representing 0
other 0
clients, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
made 0
no 0
attempt 0
to 0
substantiate 0
their 0
claims.” 0

Attorneys 0
for 0
new 0
Kavanaugh 0
accusers 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez 0
and 0
Julie 0
Swetnick 0
have 0
been 0
approached 0
by 0
committee 0
staff 0
on 0
eight 0
and 0
six 0
occasions, 0
respectively, 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

“Neither 0
attorney 0
has 0
made 0
their 0
clients 0
available 0
for 0
interview. 0

The 0
committee 0
can't 0
do 0
an 0
investigation 0
if 0
attorneys 0
are 0
stonewalling.” 1

With 0
his 0
performance 0
at 0
the 0
hearing, 0
Sen. 0
Lindsey 0
Graham 0
(R-S.C.), 0
who 0
is 0
frequently 0
a 0
target 0
of 0
conservatives 0
for 0
going 1
rogue 1
on 0
important 0
issues, 0
partly 0
redeemed 0
himself 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
many 0
conservatives. 0

While 0
questioning 0
Kavanaugh, 0
Graham 0
lambasted 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
the 0
judge 0
has 0
been 0
put 0
through, 0
calling 0
it 0
“the 1
most 1
unethical 1
sham 1
since 1
I've 1
been 1
in 1
politics.” 1

Lashing 0
out 0
at 0
Democrats, 0
Graham 0
said, 0
“If 0
you 0
wanted 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation, 0
you 0
could 0
have 0
come 0
to 0
us. 0

What 1
you 1
want 1
to 1
do 1
is 1
destroy 1
this 1
guy's 1
life, 1
hold 1
this 1
seat 1
open 1
and 1
hope 1
you 1
win 1
in 1
2020.” 1

“Boy, 1
you 1
all 1
want 1
power,” 1
he 0
shouted. 0

“God, 0
I 0
hope 0
you 0
never 0
get 0
it. 0

I 1
hope 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
can 1
see 1
through 1
this 1
sham.” 1

Graham 0
warned 0
fellow 0
GOPers 0
about 0
voting 0
against 0
the 0
nomination. 0

“To 0
my 0
Republican 0
colleagues, 0
if 1
you 1
vote 1
no, 1
you're 1
legitimizing 1
the 1
most 1
despicable 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
time 1
in 1
politics. 1

You 0
want 0
this 0
seat? 0

I 1
hope 1
you 1
never 1
get 1
it.” 1

Sen. 0
Orrin 0
Hatch 0
(R-Utah) 0
attacked 0
Democrats, 0
blaming 0
them 0
for 0
the 0
“circus 1
atmosphere 1
that 0
has 0
been 0
created” 0
since 0
they 0
first 0
Ford's 0
allegations 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
“two 0
weeks 0
ago, 0
after 0
sitting 0
on 0
them 0
for 0
six 0
weeks.” 0
This 0
“has 0
brought 0
us 0
the 1
worst 1
in 1
our 1
politics.” 1

“It 0
certainly 0
has 0
brought 0
us 0
no 0
closer 0
to 0
the 0
truth,” 0
Hatch 0
added. 0

“Anonymous 0
letters 0
with 0
no 0

no 0

“porn 1
star 1
lawyers 1

driving 0
the 0
news 0
cycle.” 0

“I 0
hate 0

worse 1

I 1
didn't 1
think 1
it 1

Was 0
100% 0
More 0
Than 0
One 0
Shooter,” 0

Were 0
Locked 0
Shortly 0
Before 0
Attack 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
mass 0
shooting 0
victim 0
Rocky 0
Palermo 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
the 0
pelvis 0
during 0
the 0
horrific 0
attack 0
and 0
is 0
now 0
speaking 0
out 0
about 0
what 0
he 0
saw 0
and 0
believes 0
happened, 0
including 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
multiple 0
shooters 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
locked 0
concert 0
gates 0
and 0
police 0
telling 0
frantic 0
civilians 0
to 0
go 0
in 0
the 0
other 0
direction. 0

Palermo, 0
who 0
has 0
done 0
various 0
interviews 0
since 0
the 0
attack, 0
appeared 0
on 0
“The 0
Blast” 0
with 0
a 0
series 1
of 1
shocking 1
comments 1
that 0
correlate 0
with 0
various 0
other 0
reports 0
indicating 0
that 0
multiple 0
shooters 0
carried 0
out 0
the 0
attack 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
is 0
actively 0
covering 0
this 0
up. 0

“I 0
definitely 0
do 0
believe 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
100% 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
shooter, 0
every 0
other 0
person 0
that 0
I’ve 0
talked 0
to 0
that 0
did 0
unfortunately 0
get 0
hit 0
as 0
well, 0
have 0
all 0
said 0
the 0
same 0
things,” 0
Palermo 0
detailed. 0

The 0
man 0
then 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
explain 0
that 0
after 0
being 0
shot 0
he 0
ran 0
“about 0
200 0
yards” 0
to 0
hide 0
behind 0
a 0
car, 0
all 0
the 0
while 0
hearing 0
bullets 0
fly 0
past 0
him 0
at 0
what 0
he 0
believes 0
was 0
ground 0
level. 0

“I’m 0
waiting 0
and 0
all 0
of 0
a 0
sudden 0
we 0
hear 0
a 0
little 0
whizzing 0
going 0
by 0
us, 0
all 0
of 0
a 0
sudden 0
bullets 0
are 0
just 0
flying 0
by,” 0
he 0
continued. 0

“When 0
something 0
is 0
coming 0
up 0
and 0
down 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
from 0
a 0
different 0
angle 0
they 0
are 0
either 0
going 0
to 0
hit 0
the 0
ground 0
or… 0
alot 0
of 0
different 0
things 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
happen. 0

When 0
someone 0
is 0
shooting 0
form 0
a 0
horizontal 0
line 0
its 0
just 0
going 0
to 0
keep 0
shooting,” 0
Palermo 0
attempted 0
to 0
explain. 0

Take 1
note 1
that 1
what 1
he 1
means 1
here 1
is 1
that 1
people 1
were 1
being 1
shot 1
at 1
from 1
ground 1
level 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
32nd 1
floor 1
of 1
the 1
hotel. 1

Palermo 0
then 0
specifically 0
heard 0
the 0
gun 0
shots 0
get 0
“closer 0
and 0
closer” 0
before 0
quickly 0
deciding 0
it 0
was 0
once 0
again 0
time 0
to 0
run. 0

Shockingly, 0
he 0
then 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
detail 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
concert 0
the 0
previous 0
two 0
nights 0
everyone 0
had 0
exited 0
a 0
specific 0
way 0
but 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
this 0
route 0
was 0
locked 0
down 0
shortly 0
before 0
the 0
attack. 0

“Every 0
other 0
night 0
at 0
the 0
concert, 0
everybody 0
kinda 0
exited 0
right 0
off 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Blvd, 0
that 0
was 0
standard, 0
that 0
was 0
routine, 0
you 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
concert 0
and 0
you 0
go 0
down 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
casino,” 0
he 0
continued. 0

“At 0
10pm 0
they 0
closed 0
every 0
exit 0
on 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Blvd, 0
every 0
single 0
one. 0

They 0
gated 0
them 0
all 0
closed 0
with 0
chain-link 0
fences, 0
10:08 0
the 0
shooting 0
started 0
and 0
we 0
were 0
pigs 0
sitting 0
in 0
a 0
corral. 0

We 0
only 0
had 0
one 0
exit 0
to 0
go 0
out 0
of…..everyone 0
was 0
just 0
kinda 0
following 0
the 0
sheep.” 0

Palermo 0
makes 0
clear 0
this 0
confused 0
concert 0
goers 0
who 0
had 0
used 0
the 0
normal 0
exits 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

“The 0
same 0
exits 0
we 0
had 0
came 0
in 0
and 0
left 0
Friday 0
and 0
Saturday 0
night 0
were 0
definitely 0
closed. 0

There 0
were 0
people 0
that 0
went 0
over 0
there 0
and 0
tried 0
to 0
leave 0
and 0
there 0
were 0
cops 0
that 0
were 0
telling 0
them 0
no, 0
you 0
can’t 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
day, 0
Horowitz 0
was 0
unable 0
to 0
find 0
solid 0
proof 0
that 0
the 0

acted 0
in 0
a 0
politically 0
partisan 0
and 0
biased 0
manner 0
in 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
case. 0

However, 0
the 0
Inspector 0
General 0
left 0
the 0
door 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
political 0
bias 0
did 0
indeed 0
play 0
a 0
role, 0
as 0
his 0
current 0
investigation 0
in 0
the 0
Russia-Collusion 0
probe 0
of 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
DOJ 0
could 0
reveal 0
new 0
evidence 0
to 0
damn 1
the 0
FBI’s 0
Obama 0
era 0
leadership. 0

While 0
the 0
report 0
refuses 0
to 0
say 0
conclusively 0
that 0
political 0
bias 0
was 0
the 0
animus 0
behind 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
Clinton 0
probe, 0
it 0
also 0
indicates 0
that 0
IG 0
Horowitz 0
may 0
have 0
more 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
political 0
leanings 0
in 0
his 0
Russia 0
report. 0

The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
explains: 0

The 0
Justice 0
Department 0
inspector 0
general 0
on 0
Thursday 0
castigated 0
former 0
FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
B. 0
Comey 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
during 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
email 0
investigation 0
and 0
found 0
that 0
other 0
senior 0
bureau 0
officials 0
showed 0
a 0
“willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action” 0
to 0
prevent 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
from 0
becoming 0
president… 0
Some 0
senior 0
bureau 0
officials, 0
the 0
report 0
found, 0
exhibited 0
a 0
disturbing 1
“willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action” 0
to 0
hurt 0
Trump’s 0
chances 0
to 0
become 0
president. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
damaging 1
new 0
revelation 0
in 0
the 0
report 0
is 0
a 0
previously-unreported 0
text 0
message 0
in 0
which 0
Peter 1
Strzok, 1
a 1
key 1
investigator 1
on 1
both 1
the 1
Clinton 1
email 1
case 1
and 1
the 1
investigation 1
of 1
Russia 1
and 1
the 1
Trump 1
campaign, 1
assured 1
an 1
FBI 1
lawyer 1
in 1
August 1
2016 1
that 1
“we’ll 1
stop” 1
Trump 1
from 1
making 1
it 1
to 1
the 1
White 1
House. 1

“[Trump’s] 0
not 0
ever 0
going 0
to 0
become 0
president, 0
right? 0

Right? 0

!” 0
the 0
lawyer, 0
Lisa 0
Page, 0
wrote 0
to 0
Strzok. 0

“No. 0

No 0
he 0
won’t. 0

We’ll 0
stop 0
it,” 0
Strzok 0
responded… 0

The 0
inspector 0
general 0
concluded 0
that 0
Strzok’s 0
text, 0
along 0
with 0
others 0
disparaging 1
Trump, 0
“is 0
not 0
only 0
indicative 0
of 0
a 0
biased 0
state 0
of 0
mind 0
but, 0
even 0
more 0
seriously, 0
implies 0
a 0
willingness 0
to 0
take 0
official 0
action 0
to 0
impact 0
the 0
presidential 0
candidate’s 0
electoral 0
prospects.” 0

The 0
messages 0
“potentially 0
indicated 0
or 0
created 0
the 0
appearance 0
that 0
investigative 0
decisions 0
were 0
impacted 0
by 0
bias 0
or 0
improper 0
considerations,” 0
the 0
inspector 0
general 0
wrote… 0

Strzok 0
has 0
argued 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
just 0
trying 0
to 0
reassure 0
Page 0
that 0
Trump 0
couldn’t 0
win, 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
implying 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
take 0
action 0
to 0
stop 0
his 0
election. 0

But 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
just 0
Page 0
and 0
Strzok, 0
there 0
were 0
FIVE 1
other 0
investigators 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
case 0
who 0
expressed 0
overtly 0
political 0
views 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
Clinton 0
and/or 0
against 0
Trump… 0
DURING 1
the 0
investigation. 0

Page 0
and 0
Strzok 0
are 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
FBI 0
officials 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
probe 0
who 0
were 0
found 0
to 0
have 0
exchanged 0
personal 0
messages 0
indicating 0
either 0
an 0
animus 0
against 0
Trump 0
or 0
frustration 0
with 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
investigating 0
Clinton. 0

The 0
report 0
identified 0
five 0
officials 0
with 0
some 0
connection 0
to 0
the 0
email 0
probe 0
who 0
were 0
expressing 0
political 0
views, 0
faulting 0
them 0
for 0
having 0
brought 0
“discredit 0
to 0
themselves, 0
sowed 0
doubt 0
about 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
midyear 0
investigation, 0
and 0
impacted 0
the 0
reputation 0
of 0
the 0
FBI.” 0
The 0
midyear 0
investigation 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
probe. 0

“The 0
messages 0
cast 0
a 0
cloud 0
over 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigations 0
to 0
which 0
these 0
employees 0
were 0
assigned,” 0
Horowitz 0
alleged. 0

“Ultimately 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
these 0
actions 0
impact 0
not 0
only 0
the 0
senders 0
of 0
these 0
messages 0
but 0
also 0
other 0
who 0
worked 0
on 0
these 0
investigation 0
and, 0
indeed, 0
the 0
entire 0
FBI.” 0

The 0
IG 0
also 0
found 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
moved 0
slowly 0
on 0
new 0
evidence 0
that 0
could 0
have 0
damned 1
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
and 0
did 0
so 0
for 0
reasons 0
that 0
make 0
no 0
sense. 0

The 0
report 0
took 0
particular 0
aim 0
at 0
FBI 0
officials 0
investigating 0
Clinton’s 0
email 0
server 0
for 0
moving 0
slowly 0
after 0
agents 0
in 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Field 0
office 0
discovered 0
messages 0
on 0
the 0
laptop 0
of 0
disgraced 1
former 0
Congressman 0
Anthony 0
Weiner 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
relevant 0
to 0
their 0
case. 0

By 0
no 0
later 0
than 0
September 0
29, 0
the 0
inspector 0
general 0
alleged, 0
the 0
bureau 0
had 0
learned 0
“virtually 0
every 0
fact” 0
it 0
would 0
cite 0
as 0
justification 0
late 0
the 0
next 0
month 0
to 0
search 0
Weiner’s 0
laptop 0
for 0
messages 0
of 0
Clinton 0
and 0
top 0
aide 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

The 0
inspector 0
general 0
derided 0
the 0
bureau’s 0
reasons 0
for 0
not 0
moving 0
more 0
quickly 0
— 0
that 0
agents 0
were 0
waiting 0
for 0
additional 0
information 0
from 0
New 0
York, 0
that 0
they 0
couldn’t 0
move 0
without 0
a 0
warrant 0
and 0
that 0
investigators 0
were 0
more 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
Russia 0
case 0
— 0
as 0
“unpersuasive,” 1
“illogical,” 1
and 1
inconsistent 1
with 0
their 0
assertion 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
leave 0
no 0
stone 0
unturned 0
on 0
Clinton. 0

The 0
report 0
also 0
faulted 0
the 0
bureau 0
for 0
assigning 0
essentially 0
the 0
same 0
personnel 0
to 0
the 0
Russia 0
and 0
Clinton 0
teams, 0
and 0
singled 0
out 0
Strzok, 0
suggesting 0
his 0
anti-Trump 0
views 0
might 0
have 0
played 0
a 0
role 0
in 0
his 0
not 0
acting 0
more 0
expeditiously 0
on 0
the 0
new 0
lead. 0

“Under 0
these 0
circumstances, 0
we 1
did 1
not 1
have 1
confidence 1
that 1
Strzok’s 1
decision 1
to 1
prioritize 1
the 1
Russia 1
investigation 1
over 1
following 1
up 1
on 1
the 1
Midyear-related 1
investigative 1
lead 1
discovered 1
on 1
the 1
Weiner 1
laptop 1
was 1
free 1
from 1
bias,” 1
the 0
report 0
said. 0

Did 0
you 0
get 0
that? 0

IG 0
Horowitz 0
can’t 0
prove 0
it, 0
but 0
he’s 0
not 0
sure 0
that 0
Strzok 0
wasn’t 0
acting 0
in 0
a 0
politically 0
biased 0
manner 0
when 0
he 0
slow-played 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation 0
while 0
moving 0
more 0
quickly 0
on 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

How 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
can 1
we 1
trust 1
them 1
even 0
as 0
they 0
express 0
bias 0
while 0
investigating 0
malfeasance? 0

We 0
see 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
corruption 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
world, 0
why 0
should 0
believe 0
that 0
these 0
officials 0
could 0
be 0
immune 0
to 0
acting 0
on 0
their 0
personal 0
biases? 0

There 0
were 0
7 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
case, 0
and 0
they 0
were 0
comfortable 0
enough 0
with 0
each 0
other 0
to 0
express 0
their 0
biases 0
openly 0
and 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
ever 0
chastised 0
the 0
others 0
for 0
expressing 0
those 0
biases! 0

Not 0
only 0
that, 0
the 0
team 0
that 0
handled 0
Clinton’s 0
investigation 0
so 0
poorly 0
was 0
almost 0
the 0
identical 0
team 0
that 0
was 0
then 0
assigned 0
to 0
handle 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation! 0

Meaning, 0
the 0
obviously 0
politically 0
biased 0
team 0
that 0
had 0
just 0
cleared 0
the 0
woman 0
that 0
they 0
supported, 0
was 0
now 0
tapped 0
to 0
investigate 0
if 0
the 0
man 0
that 0
they 0
hated 0
was 0
tied 0
to 0
Russian 0
corruption. 0

This 0
is 0
INSANE. 1

Meanwhile, 0
another 0
story 0
just 0
breaking 0
at 0
Fox 0
News 0
provides 0
even 0
more 0
evidence 0
that 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
is 0
the 0
big 1
bad 1
guy 1
in 0
the 0
FBI 0
mess. 1

Not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
slow-playing 0
the 0
Clinton 0
investigation, 0
he 0
may 0
be 0
the 0
only 0
reason 0
she 0
was 0
never 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
crime. 0

In 0
a 0
newly 0
released 0
FBI 0
email, 0
we 0
learned 0
that 0
“foreign 0
actors” 0
gained 0
at 0

some 0
access 0
to 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
unsecure 0

highly 0

report 0
on 0

case 0
later 0
Thursday. 0

The 0
House 0
committees, 0
which 0
conducted 0
a 0
joint 0
probe 0
into 0
decisions 0
made 0
by 0
the 0

in 0
2016 0

addressed 0

of 0
issues 0
in 0

“Documents 0

email 0
about 0
Clinton 0

on 0
Scribd 0

The 0
email 0
came 0
from 0
FBI 0
agent 0
Peter 0
Strzok 0
and 0
it’s 0
the 0
first 0
place 0
we 0
see 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Clinton 0
can 0
be 0
found 0
as 0
“grossly 1
negligent,” 1
in 0
the 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
intel. 0

Remember, 0
Strzok 0
is 0
widely 0
credited 0
as 0
the 0
man 0
who 0
changed 0
FBI 0
Director 0
Comey’s 0
language 0
on 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
investigation 0
from 0
the 0
prosecutable 0

to 0
the 0
legally 0
superflous 0
“extremely 1
careless.” 1

At 0
HotAir.com 0
John 0
Sexton 0
explains 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
this 0
discovery: 0

In 0
the 0
FBI 0
memo, 0
you 0
can 0
already 0
see 0
the 0
genesis 0
of 0
the 0
distinction 0
the 0
FBI 0
would 0
rely 0
on 0
to 0
clear 0
Clinton. 0

Strzok 0
writes 0
that 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
been 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
why 0
Hillary 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
getting 0
a 0
pass 0
when 0
“Petraeus/Berger/Libby” 0
did 0
not. 0

He 0
writes, 0
“We 0
draw 0
the 0
distinction 0
in 0
noting 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
evidence 0
classified 0
information 0
was 0
ever 0
shared 0
with 0
an 0
unauthorized 0
party, 0
i.e. 0

notwithstanding 0
the 0
server 0
setup, 0
we 0
have 0
not 0
seen 0
classified 0
information 0
shared 0
with 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
media, 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
a 0
foreign 0
power, 0
a 0
lover, 0
etc.” 0
In 0
other 0
words, 0
Hillary 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
hacked 0
but 0
she 0
didn’t 0
intentionally 0
give 0
anything 0
away. 0

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
statute 0
itself 0
didn’t 0
make 0
intent 0
a 0
prerequisite. 0

Herridge 0
reports 0
that 0
the 0
House 0
committee 0
memo 0
once 0
again 0
raises 0
this 0
same 0
issue: 0
“Officials 0
from 0
both 0

created 0
a 0
perception 0
they 0
misinterpreted 0
the 0
Espionage 0

lacked 0
the 0
requisite 0

belief 0
that 0
intent 0
was 0
required 0
— 0
which 0
the 0
memo 0
says 0
ignored 0
“meaningful 0
aspects” 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

It 0
really 0
does 0
seem 0
that 0
Strzok, 0
an 0
agent 0
who 0
had 0
a 0
personal 0
pro-Hillary 0
bias, 0
was 0
the 0
person 0
who 0
pushed 0
to 0
let 0
her 0
off 0
the 0
hook 0
by 0
focusing 0
on 0
her 0
intent 0
rather 0
than 0
her 0
negligence 0
setting 0
up 0
the 0
server 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place. 0

I 1
fully 1
believe 1
IG 1
Horowitz’ 1
findings 1
here. 0

I 0
believe 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
unable 0
to 0
prove 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
any 0
political 0
motive 0
to 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
case, 0
and 0
I 0
believe 0
that 0
while 0
the 0
case 0
was 0
obviously 0
mishandled, 1
it 0
could 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
conclusion 0
it 0
did 0
honorably. 0

However, 0
I 0
also 0
think 0
that 0
the 0
IG 0
has 0
purposely 0
left 0
room 0
in 0
his 0
conclusion 0
to 0
amend 0
that 0
decision 0
after 0
he’s 0
concluded 0
his 0
Russia 0
investigation. 0

In 0
fact, 0
there 0
are 0
already 0
signs 0
of 0
him 0
doing 0
that 0
in 0
this 0
report. 0

Much 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
that 0
he 0
uses 0
to 0
chastise 0
Strzok’s 0
behavior 0
and 0
judgment 0
in 0
the 0
Clinton 0
email 0
case, 0
would 0
have 0
actually 0
come 0
from 0
his 0
current 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
Russia 0
mess. 0

It’s 0
quite 0
possible 0
that 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
this 0
report 0
is 0
for 0
Comey, 0
Strzok, 0
Page, 0
and 0
Obama’s 0
FBI 0
leadership… 0
Horowitz’ 0
conclusion 0
in 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
could 0
prove 0
to 0
be 0
even 1
worse. 1

We’ll 0
see. 0

Attacking 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
Nominee 0
Is 0
A 0
Good 0
Thing 0
- 0
Here's 0
Why 0

If 0
you 0
don’t 0
like 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
can’t 0
understand 0
how 0
anyone 0
could, 0
look 0
no 0
further 0
than 0
the 0
past 0
week 0
for 0
an 0
excellent 0
example 0
of 0
what 1
on 1
Earth 1
could’ve 0
made 0
a 1
man 1
promising 1
to 1
Drain 1
the 1
Swamp 1
so 0
popular. 0

The 0
Washington 0
establishment 0
politicians 0
act 1
like 1
children 1
when 0
they 0
can’t 0
have 0
their 0
way. 0

They 1
kick 1
and 1
scream 1
and 1
lie 1
and 1
pout. 1

President 1
Trump 1
is 1
the 1
anti-politician 1
and 0
when 0
Congress 0
continues 0
to 0
behave 0
like 0
this, 0
he 0
only 0
gets 0
more 0
popular. 0

President 0
Trump 0
nominated 0
Bret 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
supreme 0
court. 0

He’s 0
a 0
pro-life 1
judge 1
and 0
his 0
vote 0
will 0
certainly 0
tip 0
the 0
scales 0
of 0
justice 0
to 0
the 0
right. 0

The 0
power 0
that 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
has, 0
some 0
would 0
argue, 0
is 0
greater 0
in 0
certain 0
aspects 0
than 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
himself. 0

Perhaps 0
that’s 0
why 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
loss 0
was 0
so 0
devastating 1
to 0
the 0
Democrats. 0

Trump 0
potentially 0
has 0
the 0
ability 0
to 0
nominate 0
3 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
justices 0
during 0
his 0
presidency, 0
thus 0
shaping 0
the 0
laws 0
and 0
morals 0
of 0
this 0
country 0
for 0
about 0
the 0
next 0
30 0
years. 0

Personally, 1
I 1
trust 1
very, 1
very 1
few 1
politicians 1
no 1
matter 1
the 1
party 1
that 1
they 1
claim. 1

So, 0
when 0
a 1
bunch 1
of 1
well-documented 1
liars 1
come 0
out 0
with 0
yet 0
another 0
sexual 0
assault 0
allegation 0
against 0
a 0
Trump 0
appointee, 0

Timing 0

The 0
most 0
suspicious 0
part 0
of 0
this 0
whole 0
situation 0
is 0
the 0
timing. 0

Christine 0
Ford 0
recalled 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
2006 0

She's 0
known 0
about 0
this 0
for 0
over 0
ten 0
years, 0
why 0
come 0
forward 0
now? 0

She's 0
affiliated 0
with 0
the 0
democratic 0
party 0
and 0
the 0
“resist” 0
movement 0

She 0
hired 0
a 0
Clinton 0
attorney, 0
Lisa 0
Banks 0

She 0
can 0
produce 0
exactly 0
zero 0
witnesses 0

Any 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
(and 0
dozens 0
of 0
other) 0
circumstances 0
by 0
themselves 0
are 0
not 0
enough 0
to 0
dismiss 0
this 0
allegation 0
outright. 0

However, 0
taken 1
together 1
as 1
a 1
whole, 1
it’s 1
far 1
too 1
suspicious 1
to 1
lend 1
it 1
any 1
credibility. 1

Ladies, 0
you 0
demand 0
to 0
be 0
believed, 0
no 0
matter 0
what. 0

Well, 0
when 0
every 1
time 1
there's 1
a 1
man 1
that 1
you 1
don't 1
like 1
running 1
for 1
public 1
office 1
or 1
being 1
nominated 1
for 1
a 1
position, 1
some 1
woman 1
crawls 1
out 1
from 1
a 1
line 1
of 1
protesters 1
and 1
makes 1
an 1
ambiguous-at-best 1
claim 1
about 1
unwanted 1
sexual 1
advances, 1
it 0
becomes 0
increasingly 0
difficult 0
to 0
take 0
you 0
seriously. 0

No, 0
an 0
accusation 0
against 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
investigated 0
by 0
the 0
FBI 0
six 0
times 0
prior 0
and 0
has 0
75 0
women 0
publicly 0
vouching 0
for 0
his 0
character 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
process. 0

And 0
guess 0
what, 0
next 1
time 1
a 1
man 1
is 1
nominated 1
to 1
a 1
position 1
who 1
really 1
has 1
committed 1
a 1
crime, 1
people 1
will 1
be 1
that 1
much 1
less 1
likely 1
to 1
believe 1
his 1
accuser. 1

Way 1
to 1
go! 1

By 0
attempting 0
to 0
derail 0
this 0
process 0
with 0
such 1
a 1
pathetic 1
attempt 1
at 1
a 1
smear 1
campaign, 1
you 0
have 0
successfully 0
made 0
it 0
much 0
easier 0
for 0
a 0
real 0
sex 0
offender 0
to 0
point 0
back 0
at 0
this 0
and 0
say, 0
“look, 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
they 0
do"! 0

Women 1
everywhere 1
should 1
be 1
furious. 1

As 0
an 0
outsider, 0
a 0
regular 1
Joe 1
American, 1
this 0
is 0
what 0
I 0
see: 0
Trump 0
nominates 0
a 0
very 0
well 0
known, 0
well-established 0
judge 0
to 0
the 0
supreme 0
court. 0

Immediately 0
every 0
Democrat 0
publicly 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
vote 0
No 0
for 0
his 0
confirmation. 0

On 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
every 0
Republican 0
publicly 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
vote 0
Yes. 0

Currently, 0
there's 0
more 0
Republicans 0
in 0
Congress 0
than 0
Democrats, 0
which 0
means 0
the 0
guy 0
will 0
be 0
confirmed. 0

There's 0
an 0
election 0
2 0
months 0
away. 0

The 0
Democrats 0
think 0
that 0
they'll 0
take 0
back 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
Congress 0
and 0
will 0
thus 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
block 0
Trump's 0
nomination. 0

All 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
delay 0
the 0
confirmation 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
election. 0

So, 0
they 1
dig 1
up 1
some 1
Trump-hating 1
woman 1
from 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
past 1
and 1
convince 1
her 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
he 1
assaulted 1
her 1
thinking 1
that 1
such 1
an 1
allegation 1
will 1
surely 1
delay 1
the 1
vote 1
long 1
enough 1
for 1
them 1
to 1
regain 1
control 1
of 1
Congress. 1

It’s 0
not 0
difficult 0
to 0
see 0
through 0
this 0
plan. 0

These 0
are 0
the 0
facts. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
my 0
opinion. 0

Everything 1
else 1
is 1
just 1
noise. 1

Pope 0
admits 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
has 0
‘long 0
ignored’ 0
problem 0
of 0
child 0
abuse 0

VATICAN 0
CITY 0
— 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
Monday 0
asked 0
forgiveness 0
for 0
child 0
abuse 0
crimes 0
and 0
cover-ups 0
within 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
admitting 0
that 0
the 0
pain 0
of 0
victims 0
“was 0
long 0
ignored, 0
kept 0
quiet 0
or 0
silenced.” 0

The 0
strongly 0
worded 0
statement 0
came 0
ahead 0
of 0
an 0
Aug. 0
25-26 0
papal 0
pilgrimage 0
to 0
Ireland, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
countries 0
rocked 1
by 1
clergy 1
sex 1
abuse 1
scandals, 1
and 0
followed 0
an 0
expose 0
of 0
pedophile 0
priests 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0

“The 1
heart-wrenching 1
pain 1
of 0
these 0
victims, 0
which 1
cries 1
out 1
to 1
heaven, 1
was 0
long 0
ignored, 0
kept 0
quiet 0
or 0
silenced,” 0
Francis 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
Letter 0
to 0
the 0
People 0
of 0
God, 0
a 0
rarely-issued 0
address 0
to 0
the 0
world’s 0
1.3 0
billion 0
Catholics. 0

On 0
Aug. 0
17, 0
a 0
Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report, 0
based 0
on 0
hidden 0
archives 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
church, 0
named 0
301 0
priests 0
from 0
the 0
state 0
as 0
credibly 1
accused 1
child 1
sex 1
abusers 1
and 0
accused 0
church 0
leaders 0
of 0
a 0
systematic 0
cover-up 0
of 0
their 0
crimes. 0

The 0
report 0
“detailed 0
the 0
experiences 0
of 0
at 0
least 0
a 0
thousand 0
survivors, 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
power 0
and 0
of 0
conscience 0
at 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
priests 0
over 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
approximately 0
seventy 0
years,” 0
Francis 0
acknowledged. 0

“It 1
is 1
essential 1
that 1
we, 1
as 1
a 1
Church, 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
acknowledge 1
and 1
condemn, 1
with 1
sorrow 1
and 1
shame, 1
the 1
atrocities 1
perpetrated 1
by 1
consecrated 1
persons, 1
clerics, 1
and 1
all 1
those 1
entrusted 1
with 1
the 1
mission 1
of 1
watching 1
over 1
and 1
caring 1
for 1
those 1
most 1
vulnerable,” 1
he 0
said. 0

“Let 0
us 0
beg 0
forgiveness 0
for 0
our 0
own 0
sins 0
and 0
the 0
sins 0
of 0
others,” 0
he 0
added. 0

In 0
the 0
run-up 0
to 0
Francis’ 0
visit 0
to 0
Ireland, 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Irish 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
Archbishop 0
Eamon 0
Martin, 0
said 0
he 0
expected 0
the 0
pope 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
victims 0
of 0
clergy 0
sex 0
abuse 0
and 0
to 0
promise 0
effective 0
remedies. 0

“I’m 1
not 1
sure 1
what 1
his 1
words 1
will 1
be 1
and 1
I’m 1
not 1
sure 1
that 1
a 1
simple 1
apology 1
is 1
what 1
survivors 1
of 1
abuse 1
want,” 1
Martin 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
BBC 0
interview. 0

“If 1
he 1
expresses 1
an 1
apology, 1
it 1
needs 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
than 1
‘we’re 1
sorry,’” 1
he 0
added. 0

In 0
his 0
letter, 0
Francis 0
repeated 0
a 0
famous 0
2005 0
quote 0
by 0
his 0
predecessor 0
Benedict 0
XVI, 0
who, 0
a 0
month 0
before 0
being 0
elected 0
pope, 0
lamented 0
“how 1
much 1
filth” 1
there 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

“With 1
shame 1
and 1
repentance, 1
we 1
acknowledge 1
as 1
an 1
ecclesial 1
community 1
that 1
we 1
were 1
not 1
where 1
we 1
should 1
have 1
been, 1
that 1
we 1
did 1
not 1
act 1
in 1
a 1
timely 1
manner, 1
realizing 1
the 1
magnitude 1
and 1
the 1
gravity 1
of 1
the 1
damage 1
done 1
to 1
so 1
many 1
lives. 1

We 1
showed 1
no 1
care 1
for 1
the 1
little 1
ones; 1
we 1
abandoned 1
them,” 1
Francis 0
said. 0

“Looking 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
past, 0
no 1
effort 1
to 1
beg 1
pardon 1
and 1
to 1
seek 1
to 1
repair 1
the 1
harm 1
done 1
will 1
ever 1
be 1
sufficient. 1

Looking 0
ahead 0
to 0
the 0
future, 0
no 0
effort 0
must 0
be 0
spared 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
culture 0
able 0
to 0
prevent 0
such 0
situations 0
from 0
happening, 0
but 0
also 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
their 0
being 0
covered 0
up 0
and 0
perpetuated,” 0
he 0
added. 0

Colm 0
O’Gorman, 0
an 0
Irish 0
abuse 0
survivor 0
who 0
founded 0
One 0
in 0
Four, 0
the 0
main 0
survivors’ 0
group 0
in 0
Ireland, 0
commented 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
offered 0
“Much 0
stronger 0
language 0
than 0
ever 0
used 0
before.” 0

But 0
O’Gorman 0
added: 0
“(The 1
pope) 1
begs 1
for 1
forgiveness, 1
but 1
still 1
does 1
not 1
admit 1
or 1
own 1
the 1
deliberate 1
policy 1
of 1
cover 1
up 1
designed 1
& 1
implemented 1
by 1
the 1
#Vatican.” 1

Like 1
his 1
predecessor, 1
Francis 1
has 1
promised 1
“zero 1
tolerance” 1
on 1
child 1
abuse, 1
but 1
scandals 1
have 1
kept 1
recurring 1
in 1
several 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
world 1
— 1
including 1
in 1
Australia 1
recently. 1

In 0
January, 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
insensitivity 0
and 0
tone-deafness 0
after 0
insisting, 0
during 0
a 0
visit 0
to 0
Chile, 0
that 0
local 0
abuse 0
survivors 0
had 0
no 0
“proof” 0
against 0
a 0
bishop 0
who 0
allegedly 0
witnessed 0
abuse 0
and 0
failed 0
to 0
report 0
it. 0

Following 0
an 0
outcry, 1
Francis 0
apologized 0
for 0
his 0
remarks, 0
held 0
private 0
meetings 0
with 0
victims 0
at 0
the 0
Vatican, 0
and, 0

According 1
to 1
church 1
expert 1
John 1
L 1
Allen, 1
an 1
editor 1
at 1
specialized 1
website 1
Crux.com, 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
has 1
a 1
structural 1
problem 1
when 1
it 1
comes 1
to 1
dealing 1
with 1
cover 1
up 1
accusations. 1

“Sixteen 1
years 1
since 1
the 1
crisis 1
first 1
erupted 1
in 1
the 1
U.S., 1
almost 1
ten 1
years 1
since 1
that 1
happened 1
in 1
Ireland, 1
and 1
now 1
more 1
than 1
five 1
years 1
since 1
Francis 1
was 1
elected, 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
still 1
has 1
no 1
credible, 1
transparent 1
process 1
for 1
handling 1
cases 1
when 1
the 1
accusation 1
against 1
a 1
bishop 1
isn’t 1
the 1
direct 1
commission 1
of 1
abuse 1
but 1
rather 1
covering 1
up 1
someone 1
else’s 1
crimes,” 1
Allen 1
said 1
in 1
a 1
Sunday 1
column. 1

Gun 1
Control 1
Is 1
Now 1
Truly 1
Impossible 1

Gun 0
control 0
is 0
the 0
dream 0
of 0
every 0
wannabe 1
statist 1
dictator 1
and 1
naive 1
do-gooder 1
alike. 0

The 1
latter 1
think 1
that 1
removing 1
guns 1
will 1
suddenly 1
force 1
humanity 1
to 1
stop 1
all 1
animosity 1
toward 1
one 1
another, 1
hold 1
hands, 1
and 1
sing 1
Kumbaya. 1

The 1
former 1
recognizes 1
that 1
an 1
armed 1
populace 1
is 1
a 1
threat 1
to 1
any 1
tyrant 1
and 1
pushes 1
for 1
gun 1
control 1
out 1
of 1
self-preservation. 1

However, 0
a 0
new 0
ruling 0
in 0
a 0
court 0
case 0
over 0
3-D 0
printer 0
files 0
of 0

has 1
now 1
made 1
gun 1
control 1
virtually 1
impossible. 1

FIVE 0

25-year-old 0

Cody 0

stood 0

on 0
the 0

When, 0

fired 0
a 0

bullet 0
into 0

without 0

first 0

his 0

was 0
downloaded 0
more 0
than 0
100,000 0

Wilson 0
made 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
go 0
all 0
in 0
on 0
the 0

dropping 0
out 0

as 0

to 0
confirm 0

belief 0
that 0

supersedes 0

The 0
law 0
caught 0
up. 0

Less 0
than 0
a 0
week 0
later, 0
Wilson 0
received 0
a 0
letter 0
from 0
the 0
US 0
State 0

demanding 1
that 1

take 1
down 1
his 1

for 1
violating 1

of 1
US 1
regulations 1
known 0
as 0
the 0
International 0
Trade 0
in 0

(ITAR), 0
Wilson 1
was 1
accused 1
of 1
exporting 1

just 1
as 1
if 1
he’d 1

Mexico 1
rather 1
than 1
put 1
a 1

his 0

warned 0
him 0
that 0

still 0

“I 0

over,” 1
Wilson 0
says. 0

… 0

Two 0
months 0

the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
quietly 0
offered 0
Wilson 0
a 0
settlement 0
to 0
end 0
a 0

he 0
and 0
a 0

of 0
co-plaintiffs 0
have 0
pursued 0
since 0

by 0
forbidding 0

was 0

“If 0
code 0
is 0
speech, 0
the 0
constitutional 0
contradictions 0
are 0
evident,” 0
Wilson 0
explained 0
to 0
WIRED 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
launched 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
in 0
2015. 0

“So 1
what 1
if 1
this 1
code 1
is 1
a 1
gun?” 1

The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice’s 0
surprising 0
settlement, 0
confirmed 0
in 0
court 0
documents 0
earlier 0
this 0
month, 0
essentially 0
surrenders 0
to 0
that 0
argument. 0

It 0
promises 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
export 0
control 0
rules 0
surrounding 0
any 0
firearm 0
below 0
.50 0
caliber—with 0
a 0
few 0
exceptions 0
like 0
fully 0
automatic 0
weapons 0
and 0
rare 0
gun 0
designs 0
that 0
use 0
caseless 0
ammunition—and 0
move 0
their 0
regulation 0
to 0
the 0
Commerce 0
Department, 0
which 0
won’t 0
try 0
to 0
police 0
technical 0
data 0
about 0
the 0
guns 0
posted 0
on 0
the 0
public 0
internet. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
it 0
gives 0
Wilson 0
a 0
unique 0
license 0
to 0
publish 0
data 0
about 0
those 0
weapons 0
anywhere 0
he 0
chooses. 0

“I 0
consider 0
it 0
a 0
truly 0
grand 0
thing,” 0
Wilson 0
says. 0

“It 1
will 1
be 1
an 1
irrevocable 1
part 1
of 1
political 1
life 1
that 1
guns 1
are 1
downloadable, 1
and 1
we 1
helped 1
to 1
do 1
that.” 1

Refused 1

“How 1

of 1
Christianity 1
today 1
walking 1
contrary 1
to 1
the 1
word 1
and 1
spirit 1
of 1
the 1
Living 1
Christ 1
(2 0
Corinthians 0

How 1
willing 1

when 1
it 1

America 0
today 0
we 0
here 0
the 0
events 0
unfold 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorra 0
and 0
how 0
Abraham 0
should 0
have 0
prayed 0
longer 0
in 0
hopes 0
that 0
God 0
would 0
have 0
spared 0
them 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
righteous 0
people 0
in 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorra 0
doing 0
what 0
God 0
had 0
commanded. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
not 0
a 0
second 0
thought 0
on 0
man's 0
behalf 0
is 0
given 0
concerning 0
the 0
victims 0
in 0
these 0
two 0
cities. 0

Here 0
is 0
Abraham’s 0
account… 0

“And 0
the 0
men 0
rose 0
up 0
from 0
thence, 0
and 0
looked 0
toward 0
Sodom: 0
and 0
Abraham 0
went 0
with 0
them 0
to 0
bring 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
way. 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
said, 0
Shall 0
I 0
hide 0
from 0
Abraham 0
that 0
thing 0
which 0
I 0
do; 0
Seeing 0
that 0
Abraham 0
shall 0
surely 0
become 0
a 0
great 0
and 0
mighty 0
nation, 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
nations 0
of 0
the 0
earth 0
shall 0
be 0
blessed 0
in 0
him? 0

For 0
I 0
know 0
him, 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
command 0
his 0
children 0
and 0
his 0
household 0
after 0
him, 0
and 0
they 0
shall 0
keep 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
the 0
Lord, 0
to 0
do 0
justice 0
and 0
judgment; 0
that 0
the 0
Lord 0
may 0
bring 0
upon 0
Abraham 0
that 0
which 0
he 0
hath 0
spoken 0
of 0
him. 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
said, 0
Because 0
the 0
cry 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
is 0
great, 0
and 0
because 0
their 0
sin 0
is 0
very 0
grievous; 0
I 0
will 0
go 0
down 0
now, 0
and 0
see 0
whether 0
they 0
have 0
done 0
altogether 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
cry 0
of 0
it, 0
which 0
is 0
come 0
unto 0
me; 0
and 0
if 0
not, 0
I 0
will 0
know. 0

And 0
the 0
men 0
turned 0
their 0
faces 0
from 0
thence, 0
and 0
went 0
toward 0
Sodom: 0
but 0
Abraham 0
stood 0
yet 0
before 0
the 0
Lord. 0

And 0
Abraham 0
drew 0
near, 0
and 0
said, 0
Wilt 0
thou 0
also 0
destroy 0
the 1
righteous 1
with 0
the 1
wicked? 1

Peradventure 0
there 0
be 0
fifty 0
righteous 1
within 0
the 0
city: 0
wilt 0
thou 0
also 0
destroy 0
and 0
not 0
spare 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
the 0
fifty 0
righteous 1
that 0
are 0
therein? 0

That 0
be 0
far 0
from 0
thee 0
to 0
do 0
after 0
this 0
manner, 0
to 0
slay 0
the 1
righteous 1
with 0
the 1
wicked: 1
and 0
that 0
the 1
righteous 1
should 0
be 0
as 0
the 1
wicked, 1
that 0
be 0
far 0
from 0
thee: 0
Shall 0
not 0
the 0
Judge 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
earth 0
do 0
right? 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
said, 0
If 0
I 0
find 0
in 0
Sodom 0
fifty 0
righteous 1
within 0
the 0
city, 0
then 0
I 0
will 0
spare 0
all 0
the 0
place 0
for 0
their 0
sakes. 0

And 0
Abraham 0
answered 0
and 0
said, 0
Behold 0
now, 0
I 0
have 0
taken 0
upon 0
me 0
to 0
speak 0
unto 0
the 0
Lord, 0
which 0
am 0
but 0
dust 0
and 0
ashes: 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
lack 0
five 0
of 0
the 0
fifty 0
righteous: 1
wilt 0
thou 0
destroy 0
all 0
the 0
city 0
for 0
lack 0
of 0
five? 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
If 0
I 0
find 0
there 0
forty 0
and 0
five, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
destroy 0
it. 0

And 0
he 0
spake 0
unto 0
him 0
yet 0
again, 0
and 0
said, 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
be 0
forty 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
do 0
it 0
for 0
forty's 0
sake. 0

And 0
he 0
said 0
unto 0
him, 0
Oh 0
let 0
not 0
the 0
Lord 0
be 0
angry, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
speak: 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
thirty 0
be 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
do 0
it, 0
if 0
I 0
find 0
thirty 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
Behold 0
now, 0
I 0
have 0
taken 0
upon 0
me 0
to 0
speak 0
unto 0
theLord: 0
Peradventure 0
there 0
shall 0
be 0
twenty 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
destroy 0
it 0
for 0
twenty's 0
sake. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
Oh 0
let 0
not 0
the 0
Lord 0
be 0
angry, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
speak 0
yet 0
but 0
this 0
once: 0
Peradventure 0
ten 0
shall 0
be 0
found 0
there. 0

And 0
he 0
said, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
destroy 0
it 0
for 0
ten's 0
sake. 0

And 0
the 0
Lord 0
went 0
his 0

soon 0
as 0
he 0

19 0
records 0
the 0
two 0
angels, 0
disguised 0
as 0
human 0
men, 0
visiting 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah. 0

Lot 0
met 0
the 0
angels 0
in 0
the 0
city 0
square 0
and 0
urged 0
them 0
to 0
stay 0
at 0
his 0
house. 0

The 0
angels 0
agreed. 0

The 0
Bible 0
then 0
informs 0
us, 0
"Before 0
they 0
had 0
gone 0
to 0
bed, 0
all 0
the 0
men 0
from 0
every 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
city 0
of 0
Sodom 0
— 0
both 0
young 0
and 0
old 0
— 0
surrounded 0
the 0
house. 0

They 0
called 0
to 0
Lot, 0
'Where 0
are 0
the 0
men 0
who 0
came 0
to 0
you 0
tonight? 0

Bring 0
them 0
out 0
to 0
us 0
so 1
that 1
we 1
can 1
have 1
sex 1
with 1
them. 1

Genesis 0
19:4-5 0
The 0
angels 0
then 0
proceed 0
to 0
blind 0
all 0
the 0
men 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
and 0
urge 0
Lot 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
to 0
flee 0
from 0
the 0
cities 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
wrath 0
that 0
God 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
deliver. 0

Lot 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
flee 0
the 0
city, 0
and 0
then 0
"the 1
LORD 1
rained 1
down 1
burning 1
sulfur 1
on 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
— 0
from 0
the 0
LORD 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
heavens. 0

Thus 0
he 0
overthrew 0
those 0
cities 0
and 0
the 0
entire 0
plain, 0
including 0
all 0
those 0
living 0
in 0
the 0
cities..." 0
(Genesis 0
19:2 0
4) 0
. 0

In 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
passage, 0
the 0
most 0
common 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
question, 0
"What 0
was 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah?" 0

is 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
homosexuality. 0

That 0
is 0
how 0
the 0
term 0
”sodomy” 0
came 0
to 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
refer 0
to 0
anal 0
sex 0
between 0
two 0
men, 0
whether 0
consensual 0
or 0
forced. 0

Clearly, 0
homosexuality 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
reason 0
God 0
destroyed 0
the 0
two 0
cities. 0

The 0
men 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
wanted 1
to 1
perform 1
homosexual 1
gang 1
rape 1
on 1
the 1
two 1
angels, 1
who 0
were 0
disguised 0
as 0
men. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
biblical 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
homosexuality 0
was 0
the 0
exclusive 0
reason 0
why 0
God 0
destroyed 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah. 0

The 0
cities 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
definitely 0
not 0
exclusive 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
sins 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
indulged. 0

Ezekiel 0
16:49-50 0
declares, 0
"Now 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
your 0
sister 0
Sodom: 0
She 1
and 1
her 1
daughters 1
were 1
arrogant, 1
overfed 1
and 1
unconcerned; 1
they 1
did 1
not 1
help 1
the 1
poor 1
and 1
needy. 1

They 1
were 1
haughty 1
and 1
did 1
detestable 1
things 1
before 1
me..." 0
The 0
Hebrew 0
word 0
translated 0
"detestable" 0
refers 0
to 0
something 0
that 0
is 0
morally 1
disgusting 1
and 0
is 0
the 0
exact 0
same 0
word 0
used 0
in 0
Leviticus 0
18:22 0
that 0
refers 0
to 0
homosexuality 0
as 0
an 0
"abomination." 1

Similarly, 0
Jude 0
7 0
declares, 0
"...Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
and 0
the 0
surrounding 0
towns 0
gave 1
themselves 1
up 1
to 1
sexual 1
immorality 1
and 1
perversion." 1

So, 0
again, 0
while 0
homosexuality 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
sin 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
cities 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
indulged, 0
it 0
does 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
primary 0
reason 0
for 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
cities. 0

Those 0
who 0
attempt 0
to 0
explain 0
away 0
the 0
biblical 0
condemnations 0
of 0
homosexuality 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
was 0
inhospitality. 0

The 0
men 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
certainly 0
being 0
inhospitable. 0

There 1
is 1
probably 1
nothing 1
more 1
inhospitable 1
than 1
homosexual 1
gang 1
rape. 1

But 0
to 0
say 0
God 0
completely 0
destroyed 0
two 0
cities 0
and 0
all 0
their 0
inhabitants 0
for 0
being 0
inhospitable 0
clearly 0
misses 0
the 0
point. 0

While 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
guilty 0
of 0
many 0
other 0
horrendous 1
sins, 1
homosexuality 1
was 1
the 1
reason 1
God 1
poured 1
fiery 1
sulfur 1
on 1
the 1
cities, 1
completely 1
destroying 1
them 1
and 1
all 1
of 1
their 1
inhabitants. 1

To 0
this 0
day, 0
the 0
area 0
where 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah 0
were 0
located 0
remains 0
a 0
desolate 0
wasteland. 0

Sodom 1
and 1
Gomorrah 1
serve 1
as 1
a 1
powerful 1
example 1
of 1
how 1
God 1
feels 1
about 1
sin 1
in 1
general, 1
and 1
homosexuality 1
specifically. 1

The 0
point 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
no 0
righteous 1
to 0
be 0
spared 0
and 0
the 0
Lord 0
did 0
what 0
man 0
failed 0
to 0
do 0
when 0
they 0
had 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

Question: 0
How 1
do 1
you 1
show 1
mercy 1
to 1
a 1
people 1
who 1
observe 1
lying 1
vanities 1
(Jonah 1
2:4) 1
and 1
refuse 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
Lord 1
(Jeremiah 1
6:16) 1
on 1
His 1
terms? 1

(Jeremiah 0
22:3) 0
God 0
must 0
be 0
true 0
and 0
judgment 0
must 0
commence. 0

Men 0
today, 0
like 0
those 0
of 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah, 0
are 0
not 0
valiant 0
for 0
the 0
truth. 0

They 0
are 0
valiant 0
to 0
proceed 0
from 0
evil 0
to 0
evil 0
(Jeremiah 0
5). 0

They 0
care 0
more 0
about 0
the 0
pleasures 0
of 0
sin 0
for 0
a 0
season, 0
than 0
they 0
are 0
grieved 0
for 0
the 0
afflictions 0
of 0
Joseph 0
(Amos 0
6:6; 0
Hebrews 0
11:25). 0

Men 0
today 0
care 0
more 0
of 0
compromise 0
(where 0
two 0
men 0
both 0
agree 0
on 0
what 0
they 0
both 0
know 0
is 0
wrong) 0
and 0
diplomacy 0
(seduction 0
in 0
another 0
guise) 0
in 0
promoting 0
anarchy 0
through 0
“antinomianism” 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
the 0
Law 0
of 0
God 0
against 0
the 0
sins 0
unto 0
judgment 0
that 0
enslave 0
men 0
(John 0
8:34). 0

Instead 0
of 0
establishing 0
judgment 0
within 0
the 0
gate 0
and 0
hating 0
the 0
evil 0
and 0
loving 0
the 0
good 0
(Amos 0
5:15) 0
in 0
hopes 0
that 0
the 0
Lord 0
may 0
be 0
gracious 0
to 0
their 0
repentance 0
(2 0
Corinthians 0
7:10), 0
they 0
reject 0
the 0
counsel 0
of 0
God 0
against 0
them 0
by 0
hating 0
the 0
good 0
and 0
loving 0
the 0
evil, 0
and 0
that 0
to 0
their 0
own 0
damnation. 0

They 1
care 1
more 0
about 0
the 0
approbation 0
and 0
favor 0
of 0
men 0
than 0
they 0
do 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Living 0
God 0
and 0
what 0
His 0
Word 0
declares 0
(Galatians 0
1:10),not 0
knowing 0
that 0
which 0
his 0
highly 0
favored 0
among 0
men 0
is 0
an 0
abomination 0
unto 0
the 0
Lord 0
(Luke 0
16:15). 0

They 0
wear 0
the 0
cross. 0

Yet, 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
testimony 0
of 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
God 0
unto 0
salvation 0
by 0
the 0
cross 0
because 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
practice 0
what 0
Christ 0
required: 0
“Deny 0
yourselves 0
and 0
take 0
up 0
your 0
cross 0
and 0
follow 0
Me” 0
(Matthew 0
16:24; 0
Romans 0
1:16; 0
2 0
Corinthians 0
5:15, 0
13:4-5; 0
Galatians 0
2:21). 0

Professed 1
Christians 1
in 1
America 1
today 1
talk 1
much 1
of 1
love 1
through 1
inaction, 1
and 1
yet 1
know 1
nothing 1
of 1
it 1
(1 1
John 1
3:18). 1

They 1
read 1
what 1
to 1
do, 1
but 1
do 1
it 1
not! 1

In 1
fact, 1
they 1
declare 1
and 1
proclaim 1
how 1
much 1
they 1
love 1
God, 1
and 1
yet 1
if 1
you 1
were 1
to 1
have 1
them 1
read 1
His 1
moral 1
law 1
and 1
look 1
to 1
their 1
own 1
lives, 1
they 1
would 1
find 1
how 1
much 1
they 1
actually 1
hate 1
God 1
through 1
their 1
actions 1
(Matthew 1
15:8). 1

Then 0
again, 0
these 0
were 0
the 0
same 0
types 0
of 0
people 0
in 0
Jerusalem 0
crying 0
out 0
"Crucify 0
him! 0

Crucify 0
him! 0

We 0
have 0
no 0
king 0
but 0
Caesar" 0
(John 0
19:15). 0

And 0
these 0
are 0
the 0
same 0
people 0
today 0
persecuting 0
living 0
Christians 0
while 0
praising 0
the 0
dead 0
ones 0
(Matthew 0
5:10). 0

They 0
continuously 0
preach 0
of 0
the 0
heroism 0
of 0
Abraham, 0
Moses, 0
Joshua, 0
David, 0
Gideon, 0
Samson 0
and 0
others 0
from 0
the 0
pulpit 0
and 0
fail 0
to 0
understand 0
what 0
these 0
men 0
were 0
doing 0
when 0
serving 0
their 0
generations 0
(Psalm 0
71:18-19; 0
Isaiah 0
51:4). 0

Today, 0
instead 0
of 0
doing 0
the 0
same, 0
they 0
simply 0
hide 0
under 0
a 0
false 0
grace 0
(Isaiah 0
30) 0
and 0
give 0
themselves 0
over 0
to 0
a 0
man, 0
the 0
president, 0
and 0
declare 0
end 0
times. 0

They 0
declare 0
we're 0
in 0
the 0
end 0
times 0
because 0
they 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
and 0
fight 0
for 0
their 0
posterity 0
in 0
keeping 0
the 0
Lord's 0
commandments 0
and 0
His 0
judgments 0
(Psalm 0
78:1-11). 0

Ungrateful 1
reprobates, 1
pretenders, 1
counterfeits 1
and 1
hypocrites 1
are 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
(Matthew 0
23:3). 0

Instead 1
of 1
reaching 1
out 1
to 1
the 1
greatest 1
demographic 1
here 1
in 1
America, 1
public 1
high 1
schools, 1
they 1
send 1
missionaries 1
to 1
foreign 1
lands 1
to 1
do 1
there 1
what 1
they 1
fail 1
to 1
do 1
for 1
their 1
own 1
here. 1

Instead 1
of 1
fighting 1
for 1
their 1
posterity 1
and 1
shutting 1
down 1
the 1
illegalities 1
of 1
sodomy 1
in 1
all 1
50 1
states, 1
they 1
teach 1
them 1
to 1
just 1
do 1
their 1
best 1
to 1
understand 1
that 1
they 1
cannot 1
help 1
themselves 1
while 1
God 1
say’s 1
the 1
opposite 1
(Leviticus 1
20:18). 1

Instead 1
of 1
fighting 1
on 1
their 1
behalf 1
against 1
the 1
federal 1
government 1
that 1
is 1
illegally 1
indoctrinating 1
them, 1
they 1
simply 1
give 1
their 1
kids 1
over 1
to 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
dumbed 1
down. 1

And 1
instead 1
of 1
protesting 1
the 1
murder 1
of 1
58 1
million 1
innocent 1
babies 1
(Proverbs 1
6:17), 1
they 1
merely 1
pass 1
it 1
off 1
as 1
a 1
"choice," 1
that 1
being 1
the 1
lessons 1
that 1
they 1
learned 1
from 1
the 1
media 1
that 1
they 1
say 1
that 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
believe 1
(Romans 1
1:18). 1

The 1
American 1
Church, 1
instead 1
of 1
protesting 1
corruption 1
in 1
government 1
through 1
the 1
example 1
of 1
the 1
Biblical 1
patriarchs 1
and 1
our 1
American 1
forefathers 1
(Matthew 1
5:17-18), 1
teach 1
to 1
submit 1
to 1
tyranny 1
as 1
if 1
to 1
suggest 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
somehow 1
obedience 1
to 1
God 1
(Romans 1
12:21). 1

The 1
Church 1
in 1
America 1
has 1
failed 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
Commandments 1
of 1
the 1
God 1
of 1
Israel. 1

Instead 1
of 1
preaching 1
out 1
against 1
sin, 1
they 1
advocate 1
for 1
that 1
which 1
God 1
clearly 1
condemns, 1
thereby 1
making 1
war 1
against 1
God 1
(Micah 1
3:5), 1
which 1
at 1
length 1
destroys 1
our 1
government, 1
our 1
country 1
and 1
our 1
families. 1

Look 1
to 1
their 1
feigned 1
strength 1
that 1
they 1
profess 1
to 1
possess. 1

It 1
is 1
gauged 1
by 1
simply 1
looking 1
to 1
the 1
prevailing 1
immoralities 1
and 1
debauchers 1
of 1
society. 1

They 1
are 1
weak 1
and 1
pathetic 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
no 1
excuses 1
as 1
to 1
why 1
America 1
is 1
where 1
we 1
is 1
today! 1

Why 0
did 0
God 0
judge 0
Sodom 0
and 0
Gomorrah? 0

It's 1
the 1
same 1
reason 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
judging 1
America 1
today 1
(Amos 1
4:12), 1
He 1
cannot 1
find 1
the 1
righteous 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
spare 1
her 1
(Jeremiah 0
22:3). 0

BEIJING: 0
The 0
US 0
embassy 0
in 0
China 0
issued 0
a 0
health 0
alert 0
Wednesday 0
after 0
a 0
US 0
government 0
employee 0
experienced 0
an 0
"abnormal" 0
sound 0
and 0
suffered 0
a 0
mild 0
brain 0
injury 0
-- 0
in 0
an 0
incident 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
a 0
mysterious 0
illness 0
that 0
hit 0
diplomats 0
in 0
Cuba. 0

US 0
and 0
Chinese 0
authorities 0
are 0
investigating 0
the 0
matter 0
after 0
the 0
employee, 0
who 0
was 0
assigned 0
to 0
the 0
southern 0
city 0
of 0
Guangzhou, 0
was 0
diagnosed 0
with 0
mild 0
traumatic 0
brain 0
injury 0
(MTBI), 0
said 0
embassy 0
spokeswoman 0
Jinnie 0
Lee. 0

In 0
an 0
alert 0
emailed 0
to 0
US 0
citizens 0
in 0
China, 0
the 0
embassy 0
said 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
know 0
what 0
caused 0
the 0
symptoms 0
or 0
of 0
any 0
similar 0
situations 0
in 0
the 0
country. 0

In 0
Cuba 0
last 0
year, 0
the 0
US 0
disclosed 0
that 0
24 0
diplomats 0
and 0
their 0
family 0
members 0
had 0
fallen 0
victim 0
to 0
an 0
unsolved 0
mysterious 0
attack 0
that 0
left 0
them 0
with 0
injuries 0
resembling 0
brain 0
trauma. 0

Ten 0
Canadian 0
diplomats 0
and 0
their 0
relatives 0
also 0
suffered 0
a 0
strange 0
illness. 0

"We 0
cannot 0
at 0
this 0
time 0
connect 0
it 0
with 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
Havana 0
but 0
we 0
are 0
investigating 0
all 0
possibilities," 0
a 0
US 0
embassy 0
official 0
in 0
Beijing 0
told 0
AFP 0
on 0
the 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity. 0

The 0
embassy's 0
health 0
alert 0
says 0
the 0
government 0
employee 0
"recently 0
reported 0
subtle 0
and 0
vague, 0
but 0
abnormal, 0
sensations 0
of 0
sound 0
and 0
pressure". 0

"The 0
US 0
government 0
is 0
taking 0
these 0
reports 0
seriously 0
and 0
has 0
informed 0
its 0
official 0
staff 0
in 0
China 0
of 0
this 0
event," 0
the 0
message 0
says. 0

US 0
and 0
Chinese 0
authorities 0
are 0
investigating 0
the 0
matter, 0
an 0
embassy 0
spokeswoman 0
said 0

"While 0
in 0
China, 0
if 0
you 0
experience 0
any 0
unusual 0
acute 0
auditory 0
or 0
sensory 0
phenomena 0
accompanied 0
by 0
unusual 0
sounds 0
or 0
piercing 0
noises, 0
do 0
not 0
attempt 0
to 0
locate 0
their 0
source. 0

Instead, 0
move 0
to 0
a 0
location 0
where 0
the 0
sounds 0
are 0
not 0
present," 0
it 0
says, 0
urging 0
people 0
with 0
medical 0
problems 0
to 0
consult 0
a 0
doctor. 0

Lee 0
said 0
the 0
employee 0
experienced 0
"a 0
variety 0
of 0
physical 0
symptoms" 0
between 0
late 0
2017 0
through 0
April 0
2018. 0

The 0
person 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
diagnosed 0
with 0
MTBI 0
on 0
May 0
18. 0

"The 0
(State) 0
Department 0
is 0
taking 0
this 0

very 0
seriously 0
and 0
is 0
working 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
cause 0
and 0

the 0

"The 0

has 0
assured 0

also 0
investigating 0

Cuban 0

In 0
Cuba, 0
the 0
American 0
victims 0
had 0
associated 0
the 0
onset 0
of 0
their 0
symptoms 0
with 0
"unusual 0
sounds 0
or 0
auditory 0
sensations", 0
a 0
State 0
Department 0
physician 0
told 0
the 0
US 0
Senate 0
in 0
January. 0

Charles 0
Rosenfarb, 0
a 0
doctor 0
and 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
bureau 0
of 0
medical 0
services, 0
said 0
the 0
symptoms 0
were 0
mixed 0
but 0
consistent 0
with 0
brain 0
trauma. 0

The 0
victims 0
suffered 0
headaches, 0
hearing 0
loss, 0
disorientation 0
and 0
some 0
loss 0
of 0
cognitive 0
ability. 0

(Video 0
YouTube/TIME) 0

Initially 0
officials 0
suspected 0
the 0
Americans 0
had 0
been 0
targeted 0
by 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
acoustic 0
weapon, 0
although 0
in 0
public 0
senior 0
officials 0
were 0
more 0
cautious, 0
speaking 0
of 0
"health 0
attacks". 0

Media 0
reports 0
have 0
suggested 0
that 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
verify 0
any 0
evidence 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
sonic 0
weapon 0
theory. 0

The 0
US 0
government 0
has 0
held 0
Cuba 0
responsible, 0
arguing 0
that 0
Raul 0
Castro's 0
authoritarian 0
state 0
must 0
have 0
either 0
carried 0
out 0
the 0
assaults 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
known 0
who 0
was 0
behind 0
them. 0

The 0
incident 0
prompted 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
last 0
year 0
to 0
withdraw 0
more 0
than 0
half 0
of 0
its 0
personnel 0
at 0
the 0
embassy 0
in 0
Havana, 0
which 0
reopened 0
in 0
2015 0
as 0
the 0
two 0
nations 0
re-established 0
diplomatic 0
relations 0
that 0
had 0
ruptured 0
in 0
1961. 0

Canada 0
announced 0
last 0
month 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
bringing 0
home 0
the 0
families 0
of 0
its 0
diplomats 0
in 0
Cuba 0
after 0
a 0
year-long 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
illness 0
failed 0
to 0
reveal 0
a 0
cause. 0

"The 0
cause 0
(of 0
their 0
symptoms) 0
remains 0
unknown 0
but 0
could 0
be 0
human-made," 0
the 0
Canadian 0
government 0
concluded. 0

Canadian 0
and 0
US 0
authorities 0
had 0
initially 0
suspected 0
a 0
"sonic 0
attack" 0
or 0
a 0
"mass 0
psychosomatic 0
incident", 0
but 0
those 0
are 0
"now 0
considered 0
unlikely", 0
a 0
senior 0
Canadian 0
official 0
said. 0

The 0
symptoms 0
included 0
dizziness, 0
headaches 0
and 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
ability 0
to 0
concentrate. 0

Unlike 0
their 0
American 0
counterparts, 0
however, 0
no 0
Canadian 0
envoy 0
reported 0
hearing 0
any 0
suspicious 0
sound 0
prior 0
to 0
falling 0
ill. 0

While 0
the 0
indictment 0
lists 0
Lambert’s 0
company 0
as 0
“Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A,” 0
a 0
simple 0
search 0
reveals 0
that 0
Lambert 0
is 0
the 0
co-President 0
of 0
DAHER-TLI, 0
“the 0
leading 0
front 0
end 0
freight 0

according 0
to 0
its 0

In 0
2012, 0
the 0
Nuclear 0
Regulatory 0
Commission 0
sent 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Lambert 0
with 0
findings 0
that 0
TLI 0
had 0
exported 0
plutonium 0
“in 0
excess 0
of 0
the 0
maximum 0

and 0
“exported 0
Australian 0

material, 0
which 0
was 0
not 0

conditions.” 0

Prior 0
to 0
his 0
26 0
year 0
tenure 0
in 0
the 0
transportation 0
industry 0
– 0
20 0
of 0
which 0
have 0

Mr. 0
Lambert 0
was 0
an 0

also 1
speaks 1
fluent 1
Arabic 1

Farsi 1
(Persian), 1
along 1
with 1
French 1
and 1
Italian. 1

The 0
indictment 0
against 0
Lambert 0
corroborates 0
prior 0
reporting 0
by 0
The 0
Hill 0
that 0
an 0
FBI 0
mole 0
buried 0
deep 0
within 0
the 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
industry 0
had 0
gathered 0
extensive 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
scheme 0
involving 0
bribes 0
and 0
kickbacks 0
between 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
officials 0
and 0
TLI 0
– 0
which 0
would 0
have 0
transported 0
the 0
U.S. 0
uranium 0
sold 0
to 0
Russia 0
in 0
the 0
’20 0
percent’ 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal. 0

“The 0
Russians 0
were 0
compromising 0
American 0
contractors 0
in 0
the 0
nuclear 0
industry 0
with 0
kickbacks 0
and 0
extortion 0
threats, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
raised 0
legitimate 0
national 1

concerns. 0

And 0
none 0
of 0
that 0
evidence 0
got 0
aired 0
before 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
made 0
those 0
decisions,” 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
worked 0
on 0
the 0
case 0
told 0
The 0
Hill, 0
speaking 0
on 0
condition 0
of 0
anonymity 0
for 0
fear 0
of 0
retribution 0
by 0
U.S. 0
or 0
Russian 0
officials.” 0

Based 0
on 0
what 0
the 0
FBI 0
knew 0
– 0
including 0
evidence 0
which 0
purportedly 0
includes 0
a 0
video 0
of 0
Russians 0
preparing 0
briefcases 0
of 0
bribe 0
money 0
– 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
deal 0
never 0
should 0
have 0
gone 0
through. 0

Moreover, 0
both 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
and 0
current 0
deputy 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein 0
were 0
directly 0

– 0
and 0
current 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
and 0
other 0
Justice 0
Department 0
officials 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
covering 0
for 0
them. 0

In 0
short, 0
the 0
FBI 0
had 0
ample 0

of 0

the 0

Attorney 0

Jeff 0
Sessions 0
originally 0
tried 0
to 0
claim 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
connection 0
between 0
Uranium 0
One 0
and 0
the 0
nuclear 0
transport 0
bribery 0
case, 0
however 0
several 0
congressional 0
republicans 0
pushed 0
back: 0

“Attorney 0
General 0
Sessions 0
seemed 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
bribery, 0
racketeering 0
and 0
money 0
laundering 0
offenses 0
involving 0
Tenex’s 0

of 0

by 0

But 0
we 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
confidential 0

was 0
actively 0
compiling 0
incriminating 0
evidence 0
as 0
far 0
back 0
as 0
2009,” 0
Rep. 0
Ron 0

(R-Fla.) 0
told 0
The 0

“It 0
is 0
hard 0
to 0

without 0
the 0

“largely 0
missed 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

investigations. 0

“The 0
essential 0
question 0
is 0
whether 0

Mr 0
Cruz 0
accuses 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
of 0
"doing 1
all 1
the 1
dirty 1
work 1
of 0
Fernando 0
Karadima", 0
and 0
describes 0
the 0
abuse 0
he 0
suffered 0
and 0
which 0
Bishop 0
Barros 0
allegedly 0
witnessed. 0

"When 0
we 0
were 0
in 0
a 0
room 0
with 0
Karadima 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros, 0
if 0
he 0
[Barros] 0
wasn't 0
kissing 0
Karadima, 0
he 0
watched 0
as 0
one 0
of 0
us, 0
the 0
youngest, 0
was 0
touched 0
by 0
Karadima 0
and 0
forced 0
to 0
give 0
him 0
kisses," 0
he 0
writes. 0

"Karadima 0
would 0
say 0
to 0
me: 0
'Put 0
your 0
mouth 0
next 0
to 0
mine 0
and 0
stick 0
out 0
your 0
tongue.' 0

He'd 0
stick 0
out 0
his 0
and 0
kiss 0
us 0
with 0
his 0
tongue. 0

Juan 0
Barros 0
witnessed 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
on 0
countless 0
occasions, 0
not 0
just 0
in 0
my 0
case 0
but 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
others 0
as 0
well." 0

Addressing 0
himself 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
Mr 0
Cruz 0
says: 0
"Holy 0
Father, 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
says 0
he 0
saw 0
nothing 0
and 0
yet, 0
there 0
are 0
dozens 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
can 0
testify 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
not 0
only 0
was 0
he 0
present 0
when 0
Karadima 0
abused 0
us, 0
but 0
that 0
he, 0
too, 0
kissed 0
Karadima 0
and 0
they 0
touched 0
each 0
other." 0

He 0
concludes 0
the 0
letter 0
with 0
this 0
appeal: 0
"Please 0
Holy 0
Father, 0
don't 1
be 1
like 1
the 1
others. 1

There 0
are 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
who 0
despite 0
everything 0
think 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
do 0
something. 0

I 0
treasure 0
my 0
faith, 0
it's 0
what 0
sustains 0
me, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
slipping 0
away 0
from 0
me." 0

Hasn't 0
the 0
Pope 0
already 0
apologised? 0

remarks 0
that 0
the 0

had 0
made 0
in 0

were: 0
"The 0

a 0

Everything 0
is 0

Is 0
this 0
clear?" 0

The 0
Pope 0
later 0
apologised 0
for 0
hurting 0
victims' 0
feelings 0
"without 0
meaning 0
to" 0
but 0
continued 0
to 0
insist 0
there 0
was 0
"no 0
evidence" 0
against 0
the 0
bishop. 0

"In 0

that 0
the 0
nuclear 0

also 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
solidified 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
grip 0
on 0
power 0
and 0
intentionally 0
prevented 0
the 0
United 0

from 0
fomenting 0

“The 0

off 0

according 0
to 0

Some 0
experts 1
fear 1
the 0
disease 0
(which 0
is 0
so 0
deadly 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
airborne) 0
could 1
mutate 1

during 0
this 0

outbreak 0
– 0
which 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
blight 0
Madagascar 0
until 0

Others 0
worry 0
the 1
plague 1
will 1
go 1
beyond 1
mainland 0
Africa 0
and 0
eventually 0
reach 0
the 0
US, 0

The 0
plague 0
spreads 0
easily 0

That 0
would 0
leave 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Daily 0
Mail, 0
experts 0
warn 0
the 0
outbreak 0
of 0
plague 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
this 0
year 0
is 0
being 0
fueled 0
by 0
a 0
strain 0
more 0
lethal 0
than 0
the 0
one 0
which 0
usually 0
strikes 0
the 0
country. 0

This 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
is 0
airborne, 0
easily 0
spread 0
by 0
a 0
cough 0
or 0
a 0
sneeze, 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
responsible 0
for 0
two-thirds 0
of 0
all 0
infections 0
this 0
year. 0

The 0
bubonic 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
plague, 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
“Black 1
Death” 1
in 0
the 0
14th 0
century 0
strikes 0
the 0
country 0
each 0
year 0
and 0
infects 0
around 0
600 0
people. 0

But 0
with 0
over 0
2000 0
alread 0
infected 0
by 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
(and 0
counting) 0
health 0
officials 0
aren’t 0
willing 0
to 0
quit 0
sounding 0

just 0
yet. 0

Paul 0
Hunter, 0
a 0
professor 0
of 0
health 0
protection 0
at 0
the 0
world-renowned 0
University 0
of 0
East 0
Anglia, 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
expert 0
to 0
predict 0
the 0
plague 0
could 0
travel 0
across 0
the 0
sea. 0

He 0
previously 0
said: 0
“The 0
big 0
anxiety 0
is 0
it 0
could 0
spread 0
to 0
mainland 0
Africa, 0
it’s 0
not 0
probable, 0
but 0
certainly 0
possible, 0
that 0
might 0
then 0
be 0
difficult 0
to 0
control. 0

If 1
we 1
don’t 1
carry 1
on 1
doing 1
stuff 1
here, 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
something 1
will 1
happen 1
and 1
it 1
will 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
control 1
and 1
cause 1
huge 1
devastation 1
all 1
around 1
the 1
world.” 1
There 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
risk 0
with 0
travel 0
that 0
the 0
disease 1
will 1
spread 1
globally, 1
Hunter 0
added. 0

“We 0
don’t 0
want 0
a 0
situation 0
where 0
the 0
disease 0
spreads 0
so 0
fast 0
it 0
gets 0
out 0
of 0
control. 0

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
it 0
spreading 0
in 0
days 0
rather 0
than 0
weeks.” 0
But 0
Hunter 0
is 0
adamant 0
that 0
a 0
well-developed 0
country 0
could 0
manage 0
the 0
plague 0
should 0
a 0
global 0
outbreak 0
occur. 0

Hopefully, 0
most 0
will 0
never 0
have 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
how 0
well 0
another 0
country 0
can 0
manage 0
this 0
infection. 0

A 0
few 0
health 0
experts 0
have 0
warned 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
UK, 0
however, 0
some 1
have 1
warned 1
the 1
plague 1
outbreak 1
will 1
certainly 1
spread 1
to 1
the 1
region. 1

Richard 0
Conroy, 0
the 0
founder 0
of 0
Sick 0
Holiday, 0
has 0
sent 0
a 0
chilling 1
warning 1
to 0
UK 0
authorities. 0

Conway 0
is 0
saying 1
it’s 1
“only 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
time” 1
before 1
the 1
disease 1
arrives 1
on 1
British 1
soil. 1

Conroy 0
warned 1
it 1
is 1
inevitable 1
that 1
the 1
plague 1
will 1
spread 1
due 0
to 0
the 0
vast 0
movement 0
of 0
people 0
across 0
the 0
globe. 0

“I 1
believe 1
that 1
it’s 1
100 1
percent 1
likely 1
that 1
plague 1
will 1
arrive 1
in 1
the 1
UK 1
once 1
more 1
– 1
it’s 1
just 1
a 1
question 1
of 1
‘when’, 1
not 1
‘if’. 1

And 0
it’s 0
not 0
an 0
exaggeration 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
threat 0
– 0
a 1
ticking 1
time 1
bomb 1
that’s 1
waiting 1
to 1
decimate 1
the 1
world,” 1
Conroy 0
continued. 0

“With 0
the 0
current 0
outbreak 0
still 0
remaining 0
treatable 0
with 0
antibiotics, 0
however, 0
the 0
current 0
risk 0
is 0
low.” 0

tactic 1
at 0

to 0

Judge 0

less 0
than 0
a 0

before 0

level 1
of 0

yet. 0

They 0
have 0
resorted 0
to 0
peddling 0
an 0
allegation 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
against 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
that 0
supposedly 0
occurred 0
while 0
the 0
judge 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school. 0

The 0
accuser 0
had 0
refused 0
to 0
identify 0
herself 0
before 0
and 0
during 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
hearings. 0

She 0
conveniently 0
waited 0
until 0
this 0
Sunday 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
via 0
an 0
on-the-record 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post. 0

The 0
accuser’s 0
name 0
is 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford, 0
a 0
registered 0
Democrat 0
who 0
is 0
currently 0
a 0
California 0
professor 0
teaching 0
clinical 0
psychology. 0

Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
on 0
Friday 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
said, 0
"I 0
categorically 1
and 1
unequivocally 1
deny 1
this 0
allegation. 0

I 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
this 0
back 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
or 0
at 0
any 0
time." 0

Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
(D-Calif.), 0
the 0
ranking 0
Democrat 0
on 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
that 0
heard 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
public 0
testimony 0
earlier 0
this 0
month 0
during 0
his 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation 0
hearing, 0
had 0
received 0
last 0
July 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
a 0
letter 0
written 0
by 0
the 0
woman 0
making 0
the 0
charge, 0
who 0
we 0
now 0
know 0
was 0
Ms. 0
Ford. 0

Even 0
though 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
had 0
the 0
letter 0
in 0
hand, 0
she 0
never 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
charge 0
during 0
the 0
public 0
hearing, 0
nor 0
during 0
her 0
own 0
meeting 0
with 0
the 0
judge. 0

Instead, 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
sat 0
on 0
the 0
letter 0
until 0
late 0
last 0
week, 0
when 0
she 0
issued 0
a 0
cryptic 0
release 0
stating 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
received 0
the 0
letter 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
give 0
more 0
details 0
in 0
deference 0
to 0
the 0
woman’s 0
wish 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
matter 0
confidential. 0

Senator 0
Feinstein 0
turned 0
the 0
letter 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

The 0
FBI 0
placed 0
the 0
letter 0
in 0
its 0
background 0
file 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
but 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
pursue 0
any 0
further 0
investigation. 0

Senator 0
Feinstein 0
had 0
initially 0
resisted 0
sharing 0
the 0
contents 0
of 0
the 0
letter 0
with 0
her 0
fellow 0
Democrat 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
or 0
to 0
go 0
public 0
with 0
its 0
existence 0
because 0
“the 0
incident 0
was 0
too 0
distant 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
to 0
merit 0
public 0
discussion” 0
and 0
she 0
had 0
already 0
“taken 0
care 0
of 0
it,” 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
source 0
quoted 0
by 0
The 0
New 0
Yorker. 0

Nevertheless, 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
evidently 0
bowed 0
to 0
pressure 0
from 0
her 0
leftist 1
colleagues 1
to 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
insert 0
the 0
allegation 0
into 0
the 0
cesspool 1
of 1
public 1
gossip 1
at 0
the 0
eleventh 0
hour. 0

The 0
New 0
Yorker 0
article, 0
written 0
before 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
publicly 0
identified 0
herself, 0
provided 0
some 0
details 0
regarding 0
her 0
allegation. 0

However, 0
now 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
has 0
decided 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
she 0
called 0
her 0
“civic 0
responsibility” 0
and 0
tell 0
her 0
own 0
story 0
publicly. 0

How 1
convenient, 1
coming 0
just 0
4 0
days 0
before 0
the 0
scheduled 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
vote! 0

The 0
whole 0
sequence 0
of 0
events 0
surrounding 0
how 0
this 0
allegation 0
has 0
suddenly 0
come 0
to 0
light 0
reeks 1
of 0
a 0
set-up, 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
how 0
Anita 0
Hill 0
surfaced 0
in 0
a 0
last-minute 0
attempt 0
to 0
derail 0
Justice 0
Clarence 0
Thomas's 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation. 0

Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
claims, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article, 0
that 0
“one 0
summer 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s, 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
a 0
friend 0
— 0
both 0
‘stumbling 1
drunk,’ 1
Ford 0
alleges 0
— 0
corralled 0
her 0
into 0
a 0
bedroom 0
during 0
a 0
gathering 0
of 0
teenagers 0
at 0
a 0
house 0
in 0
Montgomery 0
County. 0

While 0
his 0
friend 0
watched, 0
she 0
said, 0
Kavanaugh 0
pinned 0
her 0
to 0
a 0
bed 0
on 0
her 0
back 0
and 0
groped 0
her 0
over 0
her 0
clothes, 0
grinding 0
his 0
body 0
against 0
hers 0
and 0
clumsily 0
attempting 0
to 0
pull 0
off 0
her 0
one-piece 0
bathing 0
suit 0
and 0
the 0
clothing 0
she 0
wore 0
over 0
it. 0

When 0
she 0
tried 0
to 0
scream, 0
she 0
said, 0
he 0
put 0
his 0
hand 0
over 0
her 0
mouth. 0

‘I 0
thought 0
he 0
might 0
inadvertently 0
kill 0
me,’ 0
said 0
Ford. 0

‘He 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
attack 0
me 0
and 0
remove 0
my 0
clothing.’” 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
room 0
and 0
go 0
home 0
without 0
any 0
apparent 0
further 0
incident 0
after 0
“Kavanaugh’s 0
friend 0
and 0
classmate 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Preparatory 0
School, 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
jumped 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
them, 0
sending 0
all 0
three 0
tumbling.” 0

Here 0
is 0
where 0
Ms. 0
Ford’s 0
story 0
becomes 0
quite 0
murky 0
and 0
begins 0
to 0
fall 0
apart. 0

Although 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
believes 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident 0
occurred 0
during 0
the 0
summer 0
of 0
1982, 0
she 0
“said 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
some 0
key 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
incident,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article. 0

For 0
example, 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0
“said 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
how 0
the 0
gathering 0
came 0
together 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
incident.” 0
She 0
also 0
does 0
not 0
remember 0
how 0
she 0
got 0
home. 0

Yet 0
she 0
claims 0
to 0
be 0
absolutely 0
certain 0
that 0
Kavanaugh, 0
whom 0
she 0
presumably 0
knew 0
only 0
as 0
an 0
acquaintance 0
and 0
said 0
she 0
had 0
not 0
spoken 0
to 0
since 0
the 0
night 0
the 0
incident 0
allegedly 0
occurred, 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
incident. 0

Ms. 0
Ford 0
admitted 0
that 0
she 0
“told 0
no 0
one 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
what 0
had 0
happened 0
to 0
her.” 0
In 0
fact, 0
she 0
said 0
she 0
recalled 0
thinking: 0
“I’m 0
not 0
ever 0
telling 0
anyone 0
this. 0

This 0
is 0
nothing, 0
it 0
didn’t 0
happen, 0
and 0
he 0
didn’t 0
rape 0
me.” 0
Even 0
if 0
one 0
explains 0
this 0
behavior 0
as 0
the 0
natural 0
reaction 0
of 0
a 0
frightened 0
teenager 0
to 0
a 0
highly 0
traumatic 0
incident, 0
that 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
why, 0
by 0
her 0
own 0
admission, 0
she 0
“told 0
no 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
any 0
detail 0
until 0
2012, 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
couples 0
therapy 0
with 0
her 0
husband,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
article. 0

Most 0
revealingly, 0
the 0
article 0
reported 0
on 0
a 0
gaping 1
hole 1
in 1
the 1
therapist’s 1
notes, 1
portions 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
provided 0
by 0
Ms. 0
Ford 0

(R-Iowa) 0
and 0

65 0
women 0
who 0
said 0
they 0
knew 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
vouched 0
for 0
his 0
character: 0

We 0
are 0
women 0
who 0
have 0
known 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
35 0
years 0
and 0
knew 0
him 0
while 0
he 0
attended 0
high 0
school 0
between 0
1979 0
and 0
1983. 0

For 1
the 1
entire 1
time 1
we 1
have 1
known 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh, 1
he 1
has 1
behaved 1
honorably 1
and 1
treated 1
women 1
with 1
respect… 1
Brett 0
attended 0
Georgetown 0
Prep, 0
an 0
all-boys 0
high 0
school 0
in 0
Rockville, 0
Maryland. 0

He 0
was 0
an 0
outstanding 0
student 0
and 0
athlete 0
with 0
a 0
wide 0
circle 0
of 0
friends. 0

Almost 0
all 0
of 0
us 0
attended 0
all-girls 0
high 0
schools 0
in 0
the 0
area. 0

We 0
knew 0
Brett 0
well 0
through 0
social 0
events, 0
sports, 0
church, 0
and 0
various 0
other 0
activities. 0

Many 0
of 0
us 0
have 0
remained 0
close 0
friends 0
with 0
him 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
over 0
the 0
years. 0

Through 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
35 0
years 0
we 0
have 0
known 0
him, 0
Brett 0
has 0
stood 0
out 0
for 0
his 0
friendship, 0
character, 0
and 0
integrity. 0

In 0
particular, 0
he 0
has 0
always 0
treated 0
women 0
with 0
decency 0
and 0
respect. 0

That 0
was 0
true 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
remained 0
true 0
to 0
this 0
day. 0

The 0
signers 0
of 0
this 0
letter 0
hold 0
a 0
broad 0
range 0
of 0
political 0
views. 0

Many 0
of 0
us 0
are 0
not 0
lawyers, 0
but 0
we 0
know 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
a 0
person. 0

And 0
he 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
good 0
person. 0

Nevertheless, 0
using 0
their 1
standard 1
contemptible, 1
obstructionist 1
tactics, 1
the 0
Democrats 0
opposed 0
to 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
happily 0
seized 0
on 0
the 0
unsubstantiated 0
allegation 0
of 0
teen 0
sexual 0
misbehavior 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
to 0
assassinate 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
character. 1

They 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
lifetime 0
record 0
of 0
stellar 0
public 0
service, 0
multiple 0
background 0
checks 0
producing 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct, 0
and 0
the 0
letter 0
written 0
by 0
the 0
65 0
women, 0
who 0
knew 0
him 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
and 0
thereafter 0
and 0
who 0
signed 0
their 0
names 0
to 0
a 0
ringing 0
endorsement 0
of 0
his 0
good 0
character. 0

Feminists 0
gave 1
the 1
serial 1
sexual 1
predator 1
Bill 1
Clinton 1
a 1
free 1
pass 1
because 1
his 1
policies 1
were 1
in 1
line 1
with 1
their 1
ideology. 1

Senator 0
Feinstein 0
called 0
Ted 1
“Chappaquiddick” 1
Kennedy 1
an 0
"inspiration 0
and 0
a 0
friend," 0
presumably 0
also 0
based 0
on 0
their 0
compatible 0
ideologies. 0

Hypocritically 0
exploiting 0
an 0
unsubstantiated 0
allegation 0
of 0
decades-old 0
purported 0
teenage 0
sexual 0
mischief, 0
Democrats 0
seeking 1
to 1
torpedo 1
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
confirmation 0
for 0
ideological 0
reasons 0
have 0
debased 0
themselves 0
with 0
a 0
shameless 1
smear 1
campaign 1
against 0
an 0
eminently 0
qualified 0
candidate 0
for 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

Predictably, 0
Senate 0
Minority 0
Leader 0
Charles 0
Schumer 0
(D-N.Y.) 0
and 0
other 0
Democrats, 0
including 0
Senator 0
Feinstein, 0
have 0
called 0
for 0
the 0
Senate 0
to 0
postpone 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh. 0

"Senator 0
Grassley 0
must 0
postpone 0
the 0
vote 0
until, 0
at 0
a 0
very 0
minimum, 0
these 0
serious 0
and 0
credible 0
allegations 0
are 0
thoroughly 0
investigated,” 0
Senator 0
Schumer 0
said. 0

If 0
a 0
thorough 0
investigation 0
was 0
considered 0
to 0
be 0
so 0
important, 0
why 1
didn't 1
Senator 1
Feinstein 1
set 1
the 1
ball 1
rolling 1
back 1
in 1
July 1
when 1
she 1
first 1
received 1
word 1
of 1
the 1
allegation? 1

The 0
answer 0
is 0
that 0
this 1
is 1
all 1
a 1
ruse 1
to 1
block 1
Judge 1
Kavanaugh's 1
confirmation 1
by 1
all 1
means 1
necessary. 1

Senator 0
Schumer 0
is 0
fulfilling 0
his 0
promise 0
to 0
oppose 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
with 0
"everything 0
I've 0
got." 0

As 0
of 0
now, 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
Republican 0
majority 0
plans 0
to 0
move 0
forward 0
with 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh's 0
nomination 0
as 0
scheduled. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
Democrat 0
obstructionists 0
to 0
slink 1
back 1
into 1
their 1
shadowy 1
corner. 1

Couple 0
question 0
why 1
police 1
waited 1
so 1
long 1
to 1
search 1
New 1
Mexico 1
compound 1

(CNN) 0
A 0
New 0
Mexico 0
couple 0
told 0
authorities 0
months 0
ago 0
they 0
thought 0
a 0
missing 0
Georgia 0
boy 0
and 0
his 1
fugitive 1
father 1
were 0
living 0
in 0
a 1
filthy 1
compound 1
on 0
their 0
property. 0

But 0
police 0
did 0
not 0
carry 0
out 0
a 0
search 0
of 0
the 0
property 0
until 0
last 0
week, 0
Taos 0
County 0
Sheriff 0
Jerry 0
Hogrefe 0
said, 0
because 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
believe 0
they 0
had 0
probable 0
cause 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

That 0
delay 0
is 0
facing 0
scrutiny 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
Monday's 0
discovery 0
of 0
a 0
young 0
boy's 0
remains 0
at 0
the 0
compound. 0

"They 1
were 1
dragging 1
their 1
feet. 1

They 1
were 1
taking 1
too 1
long," 1
said 0
Tanya 0
Badger, 0
who 0
with 0
her 0
husband, 0
Jason, 0
told 0
authorities 0
about 0
the 0
boy's 0
suspected 0
presence 0
at 0
the 0
compound. 0

"Even 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
trying 1
to 1
build 1
a 1
case 1
or 1
whatnot, 1
a 1
child's 1
life 1
is 1
at 1
stake." 1

It's 0
not 0
clear 0
whether 0
the 0
remains 0
are 0
those 0
of 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
Wahhaj, 0
a 0
child 0
with 0
severe 0
medical 0
problems 0
who 0
disappeared 0
from 0
Georgia 0
about 0
nine 0
months 0
ago. 0

The 0
remains 0
were 0
discovered 0
in 0
a 1
wretched 1
compound 1
along 0
with 0
11 0
starving 0
children, 0
authorities 0
said. 0

More 0
details 0
about 0
the 1
horrid 1
compound 1
could 0
be 0
revealed 0
Wednesday 0
when 0
the 0
five 0
adults 0
arrested 0
from 0
the 0
site 0
make 0
their 0
first 0
court 0
appearances. 0

Authorities 0
raided 0
the 0
compound 0
in 0
Amalia, 0
New 0
Mexico, 0
on 0
Friday 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
search 0
for 0
Abdul-Ghani, 0
whose 0
father, 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
allegedly 0
abducted 0
him 0
from 0
Georgia 0
in 0
November. 0

Neighbors 0
raised 1
alarm 1
about 0
a 0
suspect 0

The 0
Badgers 0
, 0
whose 0
land 0
the 0
compound 0
was 0
on, 0
said 0
they 0
saw 0
a 0
boy 0
they 0
thought 0
was 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
February. 0

In 0
April, 0
they 0
discovered 0
the 0
boy 0
was 0
listed 0
as 0
missing 0
and 0
his 0
father 0
a 0
fugitive. 0

They 0
reported 0
the 0
sightings 0
to 0
state 0
and 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement, 0
but 0
it 0
was 0
months 0
before 0
police 0
moved 0
in, 0
the 0
couple 0
said. 0

"We 1
are 1
just 1
beyond 1
frustrated 1
that 1
they 1
took 1
so 1
long," 1
Tanya 0
Badger 0
said. 0

New 0
Mexico 0
authorities 0
had 0
suspected 0
the 0
father 0
and 0
son 0
might 0
be 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
after 0
learning 0
about 0
the 0
abduction 0
in 0
May, 0
the 0
sheriff 0
said. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
not 0
enough 0
evidence 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant, 0
and 0
surveillance 0
of 0
the 0
property 0
didn't 0
identify 0
the 0
pair 0
there. 0

"I 0
had 0
no 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
go 0
onto 0
this 0
property," 0
Hogrefe 0
said. 0

"In 0
hindsight 0
I 0
wish 0
there 0
was, 0
but 0
we 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
been 0
there 0
lawfully." 0

The 0
sheriff 0
said 0
that 0
"they 0
did 0
surveillance, 0
both 0
ground 0
and 0
aerial, 0
and 0
photographs 0
were 0
shared 0
with 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
mother 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
boy. 0

The 0
boy 0
Abdul 0
was 0
never 0
identified 0
from 0
those 0
photos. 0

Moving 0
forward 0
we 0
knew 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
this 0
compound, 0
but 0
we 0
had 0
very 0
little 0
details 0
about 0
it 0
or 0
who 0
was 0
occupying 0
it. 0

These 0
people 0
just 0
kind 0
of 0
(sprang) 1
up 1
very 0
quickly." 0

The 0
authorities' 0
view 0
changed 0
Thursday 0
when 0
they 0
said 0
they 0
received 0
a 0
message 0
about 0
possible 0
starving 0
children 0
living 0
on 0
the 0
compound, 0
and 0
had 0
enough 0
probable 0
cause 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
an 0
affidavit 0
for 0
a 0
search 0
warrant. 0

"We 0
are 0
starving 0
and 0
need 0
food 0
and 0
water," 0
the 0
message 0
said, 0
according 0
to 0
authorities. 0

Authorities 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
forwarded 0
to 0
them 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
details 0
on 0
its 0
origin. 0

Compound 1
wasn't 1
searched 1
thoroughly, 1
couple 0
say 0

When 0
officers 0
executed 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
on 0
the 0
compound, 0
they 0
found 0
a 1
horrifying 1
scene. 1

Stacks 0
of 0
tires, 0
piles 0
of 0
trash 0
and 0
plastic 0
sheets 0
surrounded 0
the 0
compound. 0

Obscured 0
by 0
the 0
junk 0
was 0
a 0
trailer 0
where 0
the 0
11 0
children 0
and 0
five 0
adults 0
were 0
living. 0

The 0
children 0
wore 0
dirty 1
rags 1
for 0
clothing 0
with 0
no 0
shoes, 0
and 0
were 0
surrounded 0
by 0
weapons 0
and 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammunition, 0
authorities 0
said. 0

"It 1
was 1
the 1
saddest 1
living 1
conditions 1
and 1
poverty 1
I 1
have 1
seen," 1
Hogrefe 0
said. 0

The 0
father 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
boy, 0
Siraj 0
Wahhaj, 0
was 0
arrested 0
at 0
the 0
compound 0
Friday 0
along 0
with 0
his 0
sisters 0
Hujrah 0
Wahhaj 0
and 0
Subhannah 0
Wahhaj 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
adults 0
-- 0
Lucas 0
Morten 0
and 0
Jany 0
Leveille. 0

All 0
have 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
abuse 0
of 0
the 0
11 0
children. 0

Morten 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
harboring 0
a 0
fugitive. 0

However, 1
the 1
Badgers 1
said 1
that 1
police 1
did 1
not 1
do 1
a 1
thorough 1
job 1
searching 1
the 1
property. 1

The 0
couple 0
said 0
they 0
went 0
back 0
over 0
the 0
weekend 0
after 0
they 0
found 0
out 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
wasn't 0
among 0
the 0
11 0
children 0
discovered 0
during 0
the 0
raid. 0

Tanya 0
and 0
Jason 0
Badger 0
said 0
they 0
told 0
authorities 0
they 0
had 0
seen 0
a 0
boy 0
they 0
thought 0
was 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
Wahhaj. 0

They 1
said 1
they 1
were 1
surprised 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
scene 1
was 1
not 1
taped 1
off 1
and 1
was 1
still 1
largely 1
untouched. 1

They 1
found 1
two 1
guns, 1
ammo, 1
tactical 1
vests 1
and 1
video 1
cameras 1
that 1
police 1
initially 1
missed, 1
Jason 1
Badger 1
said. 1

"When 1
we 1
first 1
went 1
up 1
there, 1
nothing 1
was 1
overturned," 1
he 1
said. 1

"You 1
could 1
tell 1
nobody 1
had 1
looked 1
underneath 1
that, 1
nobody 1
had 1
looked 1
underneath 1
this." 1

Father 1
allegedly 1
took 1
boy 1
in 1
November 1

Abdul-Ghani's 0
mother, 0
Hakima 0
Ramzi, 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
reached 0
after 0
authorities 0
announced 0
the 0
discovery 0
of 0
the 0
remains. 0

But 0
hours 0
earlier, 0
Ramzi 0
told 0
CNN 0
she 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
he'd 0
disappear 0
with 0
their 0
son 0
for 0
nine 0
months, 0
only 0
to 0
be 0
found 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
with 0
11 0
other 0
children 0

"My 0
husband 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
taking 0
Abdul-Ghani 0
to 0
the 0
park, 0
and 0
didn't 0
come 0
back. 0

That 0
was 0
in 0
November 0
2017. 0

When 0
I 0
would 0
ask 0
him 0
where 0
he 0
was, 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
his 0
way, 0
he 0
was 0
coming 0
soon, 0
he 0
was 0
just 0
keeping 0
him 0
for 0
the 0
night. 0

But 0
I 0
haven't 0
seen 0
him 0
since 0
then," 0
Ramzi 0
said 0
Tuesday. 0

there 0

Yet 0
Another 0
Fruit 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II 0

Still, 0
we’re 0
also 0
averse 0
to 0
speaking 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
good 0
and 0
evil. 0

Right 0
and 0
wrong? 0

Maybe. 0

But 0
good 0
and 0
evil 0
have 0
a 0
supernatural 0
ring 0
we 0
usually 0
reserve 0
for 0
dramatic 0
and 0
abominable 1
crimes, 0
like 0
genocide. 1

Yet 1
everything 1
right 1
is 1
good, 1
and 1
everything 1
wrong 1
is 1
evil. 1

The 0
evils 0
we 0
encounter 0
in 0
our 0
day-to-day 0
lives 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
spectacle, 0
like 0
jihadists 0
beheading 0
a 0
journalist 0
on 0
live 0
television. 0

All 0
the 0
same, 0
evil 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
ordinary 0
life. 0

It 0
dwells 0
deep 0
in 0
our 0
hearts 0
– 0
each 0
and 0
every 0
one 0
of 0
us. 0

The 0
Prince 1
of 1
this 1
World 1
has 0
made 0
a 0
grand 0
display 0
of 0
his 0
authority 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
centuries. 0

Our 0
saving 0
grace 0
is 0
that, 0
while 0
Westerners 0
no 0
longer 0
believe 0
in 0
God, 0
they 0
still 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Devil. 0

We’re 0
at 0
least 0
clear-eyed 0
enough 0
to 0
recognize 0
true 0
evil 0
at 0
work 0
in 0
the 0
world, 0
even 0
if 0
we 0
can 0
no 0
longer 0
see 0
the 0
great 0
Good 0
hidden 0
behind 0
the 0
veil. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
point 0
about 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
that 0
even 0
religious 0
commentators 0
tend 0
to 0
overlook. 0

How 0
was 0
he 0
allowed 0
to 0
go 0
on 0
molesting 0
young 0
priests 0
and 0
seminarians 0
when 0
virtually 0
the 0
entire 0
Church 0
hierarchy 0
knew 0
what 0
he 0
was 0
up 0
to? 0

And 0
how 0
was 0
such 0
a 0
depraved 1
individual 0
ordained 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
let 0
alone 0
promoted 0
to 0
Cardinal-Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington? 0

The 0
answer 0
is, 0
ultimately, 0
demonic. 1

As 0
Catholics, 0
we 0
ask 0
St. 0
Michael 0
to 0
“cast 0
into 0
Hell 0
Satan 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
evil 0
spirits 0
who 0
prowl 0
about 0
the 0
world 0
seeking 0
the 0
ruin 0
of 0
souls.” 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
his 0
fellow 0
perverts 1
in 0
the 0
clergy 0
are 0
responsible, 0
not 0
only 0
for 0
their 0
sexual 0
abuses, 0
but 0
also 0
for 0
chasing 0
good 0
men 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

Spend 0
enough 0
time 0
in 0
Catholic 0
World 0
and 0
you 0
inevitably 0
meet 0
good 0
men 0
who 0
quit 0
the 0
seminary 0
because 0
of 0
some 0
rampant 1
(and 0
often 0
violent) 0
depravity. 0

What 0
could 0
suit 0
the 0
Devil 0
more 0
than 0
to 0
watch 0
the 0
Church 0
burn 0
her 0
wheat 0
as 0
she 0
gathers 0
the 0
chaff? 0

The 0
gates 0
of 0
Hell 0
will 0
not 0
prevail 0
against 0
the 0
Church, 0
as 0
Our 0
Lord 0
promised. 0

But 0
they 0
won’t 0
stop 0
trying, 0
either. 0

They’ve 0
attacked 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
sending 0
the 0
Roman 0
pagans, 0
French 0
Revolutionaries, 0
and 0
British 0
American 0
secularists. 0

They 0
flank 0
us 0
by 0
sending 0
heretics 0
like 0
Arius, 0
Luther, 0
and 0
Hans 0
Kung. 0

Today, 0
there’s 0
also 0
a 0
fifth 0
column 0
working 0
to 0
tear 0
down 0
the 0
walls 0
from 0
within 0
– 0
not 0
only 0
pedophiles 0
like 0
John 0
Geoghan, 0
but 0
also 0
predators 1
like 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick. 0

Where 0
did 0
those 0
fifth 0
columnists 0
enter? 0

Why, 0
there’s 1
only 1
one 1
possible 1
explanation: 1
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

Aggiornamento 0
sounds 0
like 0
a 0
Lefebvrist 0
slur. 0

The 0
idea 0
that 0
an 0
ecumenical 0
council 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
would 0
openly 0
seek 0
to 0
“bring 0
itself 0
up 0
to 0
date” 0
is 0
ridiculous. 0

Yet 0
that 0
was 0
precisely 0
the 0
aim. 0

As 0
St 0
Pope 0
John 0
XXIII 0
explained, 0
“Its 0
principal 0
task 0
will 0
be 0
concerned 0
with 0
the 0
conditions 0
and 0
modernization 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
after 0
20 0
centuries 0
of 0
life.” 0
It 0
was 0
not 0
supposed 0
(as 0
some 0
have 0
claimed) 0
to 0
simply 0
update 0
the 0
liturgy 0
from 0
its 0
last 0
redesign 0
in 0
1570. 0

The 0
goal 0
was 0
to 0
align 0
the 0
Church 0
more 0
with 0
modern 0
world: 0
a 0
world 0
defined, 0
to 0
a 0
considerable 0
extent, 0
by 0
its 0
rejection 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
world 0
that 0
flourished 0
before 0
the 0
Protestant 0
Reformation 0
and 0
French 0
Revolution. 0

Now, 0
I 0
don’t 0
believe 0
Pope 0
John 0
saw 0
himself 0
as 0
endangering 0
either 0
orthodoxy 0
or 0
sacred, 0
immutable 0
tradition. 0

I 0
share 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
IV’s 0
view. 0

When 0
he 0
heard 0
that 0
the 0
Council 0
was 0
being 0
convened, 0
then-Cardinal 0
Montini 0
is 0
supposed 0
to 0
have 0
sighed, 0
“This 0
holy 1
old 1
boy 1
doesn’t 0
realise 0
what 0
a 0
hornet’s 0
nest 0
he’s 0
stirring 0
up.” 0

Nonetheless, 0
he 0
stirred 0
it. 0

The 0
spirit 0
of 0
aggiornamento 0
quickly 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
1960s 0
– 0
and 0
the 0
seminaries 0
especially. 0

Seminarians 0
called 0
for 0
a 0
more 0
“participatory” 0
administration. 0

They 0
became 0
involved 0
in 0
socialist 0
politics. 0

They 0
formed 0
trade 0
unions 0
to 0
demand 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
marry. 0

They 0
practiced 0
sauvage 0
intercommunion. 0

Of 0
course, 0
they 0
had 0
their 0
enablers 0
in 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
as 0
well. 0

Perhaps 0
the 0
worst 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
Marty 0
of 0
Paris, 0
a 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
“priest-worker 0
movement” 0
who 0
defended 0
Marxist 0
and 0
existentialist 0
atheisms 0
on 0
the 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
Council. 0

During 0
a 0
homily 0
at 0
the 0
Cathedral, 0
he 0
also 0
praised 0
the 0
soixantehuitards: 0
“the 0
great 0
outburst 0
of 0
the 0
younger 0
generation 0
that 0
suddenly 0
wanted 0
to 0
take 0
its 0
place 0
in 0
life” 0
that 0
occurred 0
in 0
his 0
city 0
in 0
May 0
of 0
1968. 0

“One 0
also 0
felt 0
that, 0
in 0
these 0
events 0
of 0
May,” 0
Marty 0
continued, 0
“the 0
seriousness 0
of 0
the 0
working 0
class, 0
which 0
wants 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
earn 0
a 0
living 0
wage, 0
but 0
also 0
to 0
find 0
its 0
freedom, 0
its 0
independence.” 0
Theaggiornamentistas 0
was 0
never 0
purged 0
from 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
certainly 0
not 0
from 0
the 0
seminaries. 0

As 0
the 0
modern 0
world 0
continued 0
to 0
reject 0
traditional 0
Christian 0
mores, 0
so 0
too 0
does 0
the 0
Church 0
seem 0
increasingly 0
“out 0
of 0
step” 0
and 0
in 0
need 0
of 0
“modernizing”. 0

Inevitably, 0
this 0
came 0
to 0
mean 0
the 0
acceptance 0
of 0
homosexuality. 0

Bishop 0
Wilton 0
D. 0
Gregory, 0
as 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Conference 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Bishops, 0
infamously 0
spoke 0
of 0
“an 0
ongoing 0
struggle 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
Catholic 0
priesthood 0
is 0
not 0
dominated 0
by 0
homosexual 0
men.” 0

But 0
that 0
predominance 0
has 0
very 0
little 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
homosexuality 0
per 0
se. 0

Rather, 0
the 0
1960s 0
rejection 0
of 0
celibacy 0
in 0
the 0
seminaries 0
naturally 0
provided 0
more 0
(shall 0
we 0
say) 0
opportunities 0
for 0
gay 0
men 0
– 0
given 0
that 0
there 0
are, 0
of 0
course, 0
no 0
women 0
in 0
Catholic 0
seminaries. 0

This 0
began 0
driving 0
away 0
heterosexuals, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
homosexuals 0
who 0
upheld 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teachings 0
on 0
chastity 0
and 0
celibacy. 0

Needless 0
to 0
say, 0
not 0
all 0
gay 0
priests 0
are 0
violent 1
predators 1
like 0
McCarrick. 0

But 0
the 0
toleration 0
of 0
sexually 0
active 0
priests 0
gave 0
McCarrick 0
cover 0
to 0
“seduce” 0
his 0
victims. 0

Many 0
have 0
also 0
speculated 0
that, 0
because 0
McCarrick’s 0
victims 0
were 0
overwhelmingly 0
above 0
the 0
age 0
of 0
consent, 0
the 0
media 0
didn’t 0
consider 0
them 0
newsworthy. 0

If 0
he’d 0
fondled 0
a 0
12-year 0
old 0
altar 0
boy, 0
that 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
one 0
thing. 0

Pedophile 1
priests 1
sell 1
papers. 1

But 0
taking 0
an 0
18-year-old 0
seminarian 0
to 0
bed? 0

Running 0
that 0
story 0
would 0
simply 0
be 0
outing 0
a 0
closeted 1
gay 1
man: 1
an 0
act 0
the 0
liberal 0
press 0
would 0
no 0
doubt 0
consider 0
“homophobic”, 0
as 0
Ross 0
Douthat 0
pointed 0
out. 0

Meanwhile, 0
those 0
bishops 0
who 0
didn’t 0
approve 0
of 0
his 0
actions 0
knew 0
the 0
culture 0
– 0
both 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
without 0
her 0
– 0
were 0
against 0
them. 0

The 0
post-Vatican 0
Church 0
doesn’t 0
like 0
to 0
come 0
off 0
as 0
a 0
nag. 0

She’s 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
cause 0
a 0
fuss 0
by 0
purging 0
sexually 0
active 0
gay 0
men 0
from 0
the 0
clergy 0
just 0
because… 0
what? 0

It’s 0
immoral? 0

That’s 0
not 0
very 0
aggiornamentistic! 0

The 0
world 0
and 0
our 0
worldly 0
bishops 0
were, 0
unsurprisingly, 0
of 0
one 0
mind. 0

And 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
were 0
disgusted 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
these 0
prelates 0
weren’t 0
willing 0
to 0
jeopardize 0
their 0
careers 0
by 0
standing 0
for 0
justice 0
against 0
vice. 0

We 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
slouching 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
old 0
traditionalist 0
trope: 0
All 0
the 0
Church’s 0
problems 0
would 0
be 0
solved 0
if 0
we’d 0
just 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
Latin 0
Mass. 0

Something 0
went 0
critically 1
wrong 1
during 0
Vatican 0
II 0
that 0
extends 0
well 0
beyond 0
the 0
Mass. 0

And 0
we 0
can’t 0
drag 0
the 0
Church 0
out 0
of 0
her 0
present 0
crisis 0
until 0
we 0
have 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
brave 0
accusations 0
of 0
“Lefebvrism” 0
and 0
say 0
so. 0

Those 0
who 0
love 0
our 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
– 0
those 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
protect 0
her 0
boys 0
and 0
men 0
from 0
all 0
the 0
McCarricks 0
and 0
their 0
perverse 1
appetites 0
– 0
mustn’t 0
be 0
deceived 0
into 0
thinking 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
small 0
or 0
an 0
isolated 0
issue. 0

It 0
isn’t. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
crisis 0
of 0
an 0
ancient 0
and 0
immortal 0
institution 0
trying 0
desperately 0
to 0
seem 0
young 0
and 0
fashionable; 0
like 0
all 0
old 0
men, 0
it 0
only 0
manages 0
to 0
come 0
across 0
as 0
lecherous 1
and 1
pathetic. 1

Its 0
obsession 0
with 0
“modernization” 0
leads 0
it 0
to 0
only 0
adopt 0
the 0
vices 0
of 0
modernity. 0

Instead 0
of 0
serving 0
as 0
ambassadors 0
from 0
the 0
City 0
of 0
God, 0
far 0
too 0
many 0
of 0
our 0
priests 0
and 0
prelates 0
have 0
become 0
agents 0
of 0
the 0
City 0
of 0
Man. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
what 0
it 0
will 0
take 0
to 0
set 0
things 0
right. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know 1
what 1
it 1
will 1
take 1
to 0
exorcise 0
the 0
“spirit 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II” 0
– 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
aggiornamento 0

But 0
we 1
will. 1

EXPERIMENTAL 0
Ebola 0
Vaccine 0
Will 0
Be 0
Administered 0
In 0
Congo 0
As 0
Ebola 0
Death 0
Toll 0
Climbs 0

An 0
experimental 0
Ebola 0
vaccine 0
is 0
being 0
rolled 0
out 0
in 0
Congo 0
as 0
the 1
death 1
toll 1
from 1
the 1
infectious 1
disease 1
continues 1
to 1
climb. 1

The 0
vaccination 0
campaign 0
will 0
begin 0
today. 0

“The 0
vaccination 0
campaign 0
begins 0
tomorrow, 0
Monday, 0
in 0
Mbandaka, 0
capital 0
of 0
the 0
province,” 0
Minister 0
of 0
Health 0
Oly 0
Ilunga 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press 0
as 0
reported 0
by 0
9 0
News 0
Australia. 0

“It 0
will 0
target, 0
first, 0
the 0
health 0
staff, 0
the 0
contacts 0
of 0
the 0
sick 0
and 0
the 0
contacts 0
of 0
the 0
contacts.” 0
The 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
has 0
been 0
warning 0
about 0
the 0
“Ebola 0
situation” 0
in 0
Congo, 0
and 0
it 0
appears 0
their 0
only 1
solution 1
is 0
an 0
experimental 0
vaccine. 0

An 0
experimental 0
vaccine 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
tried 0
on 0
humans 0
before. 0

Ebola 0
hemorrhagic 0
fever, 0
seen 0
mostly 0
only 0
in 0
Africa, 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 0
feared 0
diseases. 0

It 0
begins 0
with 0
flu-like 0
symptoms, 0
followed 0
by 0
bloody 0
diarrhea 0
and 0
vomiting. 0

Days 0
later, 0
some 0
victims 0
begin 0
bleeding 0
through 0
the 0
nose, 0
mouth, 0
and 0
eyes. 0

Depending 0
on 0
the 0
strain 0
of 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus, 0
it 1
can 1
kill 1
up 1
to 1
90% 1
of 1
victims. 1

There 0
is 0
no 0
cure 0
for 0
Ebola. 0

The 0
virus 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
direct 0
contact 0
with 0
the 0
blood 0
or 0
secretions 0
of 0
an 0
infected 0
person. 0

So, 0
is 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus 0
reaching 0
a 0
terrifying 1
enough 0
level 0
that 0
an 0
experimental 0
vaccine 0
is 0
warranted? 0

The 0
death 0
toll 0
has 0
reached 0
26 0
and 0
the 0
vaccine 0
will 0
be 0
rolled 0
out 0
at 0
Mbandaka, 0
the 0
north-western 0
city 0
of 0
1.2 0
million 0
recently 0
struck 0
by 0
the 0
outbreak. 0

Since 0
the 0
virus 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
direct 0
contact, 0
an 0
isn’t 0
airborne, 0
it 0
isn’t 0
nearly 0
as 0
deadly 0
as 0
it 0
could 0
be. 0

Read 0
more 0
here 0
about 0
Ebola 0
and 0
how 0
it 0
is 0
transmitted: 0

Initially, 0
the 0
campaign 0
will 0
target 0
600 0
people, 0
mainly 0
medical 0
staff, 0
contacts 0
of 0
suspected 0
cases, 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
contact 0
with 0
the 0
contacts, 0
Ilunga 0
said. 0

Officials 0
are 0
working 0
urgently 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
disease 0
from 0
spreading 0
beyond 0
Mbandaka, 0
which 0
lies 0
on 0
the 0
Congo 0
River, 0
a 0
busy 0
traffic 0
corridor, 0
and 0
is 0
an 0
hour’s 0
flight 0
from 0
the 0
capital. 0

The 0
spread 0
of 0
Ebola 0
from 0
a 0
rural 0
area 0
to 0
Mbandaka 0
has 0
raised 0
alarm 1
as 1
Ebola 1
can 1
spread 1
more 1
quickly 1
in 1
urban 1
centers. 1

The 0
fever 0
can 0
cause 0
severe 0
internal 0
bleeding 0
that 0
is 0
often 0
fatal. 0

Meaning, 0
the 0
virus 0
itself 0
doesn’t 0
actually 0
kill. 0

The 0
immune 0
system’s 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
virus 0
is 0
what’s 0
deadly. 0

ZMapp 0
is 0
also 0
an 0
experimental 0
drug 0
that 0
could 0
aid 0
in 0
the 0
recovery 0
from 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus. 0

But, 0
like 0
the 0
vaccine 0
being 0
administered, 0
it 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
tested 0
for 0
safety 0
or 0
efficacy 0
yet. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
vaccine 0
– 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
therapeutic 0
drug. 0

Of 0
the 0
seven 0
people 0
given 0
the 0
drug 0
so 0
far, 0
two 0
have 0
died. 0

ZMapp 0
show 0
“promise,” 0
although 0
scientific 0
results 0
are 0
not 0
definitive. 0

The 0
risk 0
of 0
Ebola 0
spreading 0
within 0
Congo 0
is 0
“very 1
high,” 1
according 0
to 0
authorities, 0
and 0
the 1
disease 1
could 1
also 1
move 1
into 1
nine 1
neighboring 1
countries, 1
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organization 0
has 0
warned. 0

The 0
WHO, 0
however, 0
stopped 0
short 0
of 0
declaring 0
the 0
outbreak 0
a 0
global 0
health 0
emergency. 0

WHO 0
said 0
there 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
restrictions 0
on 0
international 0
travel 0
or 0
trade. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
it’s 0
important 0
to 0
prevent 0
oneself 0
from 0
contracting 0
the 0
virus. 0

Unfortunately, 0
health 0
care 0
workers 0
are 0
at 0
the 0
greatest 0
risk 0
as 0
they 0
try 0
to 0
cull 0
the 0
suffering: 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
experimental 0
vaccine. 0

For 0
their 0
sake, 0
let’s 0
hope 0
it 0
works 0
better 0
than 0
this 1
year’s 1
flu 1
vaccine. 1

Puerto 0

Power 0
Grid 0
Failure 0
Is 0
Causing 0
A 0
Public 0
Health 0
Crisis 1
Of 1
Epic 1
Proportions 1

One 0
month 0
after 0
the 0
devastating 1
Hurricane 0
Maria 0
wreaked 0
havoc 0
on 0
the 0
island 0
of 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
the 0
territory 0
is 0
still 0
facing 0
a 0
public 0
health 0
crisis. 0

And 0
it’s 0
a 0
crisis 1
of 1
epic 1
proportions. 1

On 0
Friday, 0
former 0
Puerto 0
Rican 0
Governor 0
Alejandro 0
García 0
Padilla 0
tweeted 0
a 0
photo 0
from 0
inside 0
a 0
hospital, 0
in 0
which 0
scrubbed-up 0
doctors 0
leaned 0
over 0
an 0
operating 0
table 0
performing 0
surgery 0
lit 0
only 0
by 0
a 0
flashlight. 0

According 0
to 0
Slate, 0
the 0
image 0
quickly 0
made 0
the 0
rounds 0
on 0
the 0
internet; 0
it 0
currently 0
has 0
almost 0
9,000 0
retweets 0
and 0
many 0
speculate 0
that 0
that’s 0
probably 0
because 0
the 1
blurry 1
picture 1
feels 1
like 1
it’s 1
worth 1
a 1
good 1
deal 1
more 1
than 1
1,000 1
words. 1

It 1
illuminates 1
just 1
a 1
small 1
sliver 1
of 1
the 1
public 1
health 1
crisis 1
Puerto 0

Millions 0
of 0
residents 0
still 0
don’t 0
have 0
access 0
to 0
electricity 0
or 0
proper 0
health 0
care, 0
and 0
bacteria 0
in 0
the 0
water 0
have 0
exposed 0
many 0
people 0
to 0
disease. 0

And 0
calls 0
for 0
help 0
have 0
gone 0
unanswered 0
besides 0
the 0
few 0
willing 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
the 0
devastated 1
island 0
privately. 0

Senator 0
Martin 0
Heinrich 0
(D-NM) 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
other 0
lawmakers 0
are 0
calling 0
on 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
provide 0
aid 0
to 0
the 1
post-apocalyptic 1
ravaged 1
territory. 1

“Even 0
before 0
Hurricanes 0
Irma 0
and 0
Maria 0
hit 0
the 0
U.S. 0
territories, 0
the 0
islands’ 0
health 0
care 0
system 0
was 0
suffering 0
from 0
the 0
ongoing 0
economic 0
crisis. 0

The 1
islands 1
are 1
grappling 1
with 1
physician 1
shortages, 1
Medicaid 1
programs 1
facing 1
an 1
impending 1
funding 1
cliff, 1
and 1
widespread 1
disparities 1
in 1
Federal 1
health 1
programs—and 1
that 1
was 1
before 1
hurricane 1
season,” 1
the 0
lawmakers 0
stated 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

“We 0
are 0
grateful 0
for 0
the 0
public 0
health 0
emergency 0
declaration 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
and 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Virgin 0
Islands, 0
but 1
more 1
can 1
and 1
should 1
be 1
done 1
to 1
help 1
Americans 1
impacted 1
by 1
these 1
disasters.” 1

The 0
senators 0
stressed 0
that 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
islands’ 0
power 0
and 0
communication 0
networks 0
are 0
out 0
and, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Federal 0
Emergency 0
Management 0
Agency 0
(FEMA), 0
it 0
will 0
take 0
months 0
before 0
power 0
is 0
fully 0
restored. 0

Hospitals 0
have 0
been 0
forced 0
to 0
prioritize 0
patients, 0
ration 0
services, 0
and 0
forgo 0
elective 0
surgeries. 0

The 0
power 0
grid’s 0
failure 0
has 0
caused 0
more 0
problems 0
than 0
many 0
anticipated, 0
like 0
the 0
stall 0
of 0
relief 0
efforts. 0

Without 0
electricity, 0
communications 0
are 0
non-existent 0
too. 0

Some 0
33 0
days 0
after 0
Hurricane 0
Maria 0
made 0
landfall 0
on 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
only 0
23 0
percent 0
of 0
residents 0
have 0
electricity, 0
according 0
to 0
Status.pr, 0
which 0
provides 0
daily 0
updates 0
on 0
basic 0
services 0
on 0
the 0
island. 0

While 0
there 0
are 0
still 0
other 0
problems 0
as 0
well, 0
such 0
as 0
gas 0
stations 0
being 0
slow 0
to 0
reopen, 0
and 0
roads 0
getting 0
badly 0
damaged, 0
the 1
power 1
grid’s 1
utter 1
annihilation 1
in 0
the 0
category 0
4 0
winds 0
is 0
not 0
just 0
a 0
temporary 0
inconvenience. 0

The 0
different 0
ways 0
that 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
electricity 0
can 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
cascade 0
of 0
other 0
crises 0
is 0
becoming 0
increasingly 0
clear. 0

A 0
giant 0
government-owned 0
hospital 0
ship, 0
the 0
USNS 0
Comfort, 0
arrived 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
weeks 0
ago 0
to 0
help 0
out, 0
but 0
many 0
people 0
don’t 0
know 0
about 0
the 0
ship. 0

Without 0
electricity, 0
most 0
cell 0
phone 0
towers 0
are 0
down. 0

But 0
even 0
if 0
communications 0
were 0
working, 0
residents 0
can’t 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
port, 0
as 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
island’s 0
roads 0
are 0
impassable 0
and 0
most 0
are 0
without 0
gasoline 0
to 0
power 0
a 0
car. 0

The 0
ship 0
has 0
extensive 0
space 0
and 0
equipment 0
for 0
trauma 0
care 0
and 0
a 0
large 0
staff, 0
but 0
CNN 0
reported 0
that 0
as 0
of 0
last 0
Tuesday, 0
only 0
33 0
of 0
250 0
beds 0
were 0
full. 0

The 0
looming 1
crisis 1
seems 0
to 0
be 0
getting 0
worse, 0
not 0
better, 0
and 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
is 0
experiencing 0
a 0
medical 0
crisis 0
of 0
epic 0
proportions. 0

Nigel 0
Farage 0
Warns 0
“We’ll 0
Lose” 0
A 0
Battle 0
Between 0
the 0
West 0
and 0
Islam 0

British 0
politician 0
Nigel 0
Farage 0
once 0
helped 0
convince 0
Britons 0
to 0
vote 0
for 0
Brexit 0
and 0
separate 0
from 0
the 0
European 0
Union, 0
but 1
British 1
establishment 1
politicians 1
have 1
done 1
everything 1
they 1
could 1
to 1
sabotage 1
that 1
vote 1
since 1
then. 1

Now 0
Farage 0
has 0
apparently 0
decided 0
that 0
if 1
he 1
can’t 1
beat 1
them, 1
he’ll 1
join 1
them 1
— 0
if 0
not 0
on 0
Brexit, 0
then 0
in 0
their 0
stance 1
of 1
denial 1
and 1
appeasement 1
regarding 0
the 1
global 1
jihad 1
threat.’ 1

At 0
a 0
recent 0
dinner 0
of 0
the 0
UK 0
Independence 0
Party 0
(UKIP), 0
which 0
he 0
formerly 0
headed, 0
Farage 0
said: 0
“If 1
dealing 1
with 1
Islamic 1
fundamentalism 1
becomes 1
a 1
battle 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
entire 1
religion, 1
I’ll 1
tell 1
you 1
the 1
result: 1
we’ll 1
lose. 1

We 1
will 1
simply 1
lose….We 1
absolutely 1
have 1
to 1
get 1
that 1
Muslim 1
majority 1
living 1
in 1
many 1
of 1
our 1
towns 1
and 1
cities 1
on 1
our 1
side, 1
more 1
attuned 1
to 1
Western 1
values 1
than 1
some 1
pretty 1
hardline 1
interpretations 1
of 1
the 1
Qur’an.” 1

Sure. 1

Now 0
how 0
does 0
Farage 0
propose 0
to 0
do 0
that? 0

His 0
warning 0
against 0
making 0
the 0
resistance 0
to 0
jihad 0
a 1
“battle 1
between 1
us 1
and 1
the 1
entire 1
religion” 1
is 0
odd. 0

No 1
sane 1
person 1
is 1
saying 1
that 1
the 1
West 1
should 1
go 1
to 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
entire 1
Islamic 1
world. 1

The 0
likeliest 0
interpretation 0
of 0
his 0
statement 0
is 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
saying 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
not 0
speak 0
about 0
how 0
jihadis 1
find 0
justification 0
for 0
their 0
actions 0
in 0
the 0
Qur’an 0

But 1
if 1
we 1
don’t 1
speak 1
about 1
such 1
facts, 1
how 1
will 1
we 1
ever 1
convince 1
Muslims 1
not 1
to 1
follow 1
“hardline 1

Another 1
problem 1
with 1
Farage’s 1
statement 1
is 1
that 1
it 1
manifests 1
a 1
remarkable 1
ignorance 1
of 1
history. 1

While 1
he 1
is 1
deeply 1
concerned 1
that 1
British 1
people 1
not 1
begin 1
to 1
think 1
that 1
resisting 1
jihad 1
terror 1
means 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
in 1
a 1
“battle” 1
with 1
the 1
“entire 1
religion” 1
of 1
Islam, 1
he 1
appears 1
unaware 1
of 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
many 1
Muslims 1
throughout 1
history 1
have 1
considered 1
their 1
entire 1
religion 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
entire 1
non-Muslim 1
world. 1

fifteenth-century 1
Persian 1
who 1
wrote 1
a 1
biography 1
of 1
the 1
Mongol 1
Muslim 1
warrior 1
Tamerlane, 1
observed 1
that 1
“the 1
Qur’an 1
says 1
the 1
highest 1
dignity 1
man 1
can 1
attain 1
is 1
that 1
of 1
making 1
war 1
in 1
person 1
against 1
the 1
enemies 1
of 1
his 1
religion. 1

Muhammad 1
advises 1
the 1
same 1
thing, 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
tradition 1
of 1
the 1
Muslim 1
doctors: 1
wherefore 0
the 0
great 0
Temur 0
always 0
strove 0
to 1
exterminate 1
the 1
infidels, 1
as 0
much 0
to 0
acquire 0
that 0
glory, 0
as 0
to 0
signalise 0
himself 0
by 0
the 0
greatness 0
of 0
his 0
conquests.” 0

After 0
conquest 0
came 0
dhimmitude, 0
the 0
subjugated 0
status 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
mandates 0
for 0
“the 1
People 1
of 1
the 1
Book” 1
(primarily 0
Jews 0
and 0
Christians). 0

In 0
the 0
early 0
twelfth 0
century, 0
the 0
Fatimid 1
caliph 1
Al-Amir 1
bi-Ahkamillah 1
issued 1
this 1
edict: 1

Now, 1
the 1
prior 1
degradation 1
of 1
the 1
infidels 1
in 1
this 1
world 1
before 1
the 1
life 1
to 1
come—where 1
it 1
is 1
their 1
lot—is 1
considered 1
an 1
act 1
of 1
piety; 1
and 1
the 1
imposition 1
of 1
their 1
poll 1
tax 1
[jizya], 1
“until 1
they 1
pay 1
the 1
tribute 1
out 1
of 1
hand 1
and 1
have 1
been 1
humbled” 1
(Koran 1
9:29) 1
is 1
a 1
divinely 1
ordained 1
obligation….The 1
dhimmi’s 1
payment 1
of 1
his 1
dues 1
by 1
a 1
bill 1
drawn 1
on 1
a 1
Muslim, 1
or 1
by 1
delegating 1
a 1
real 1
believer 1
to 1
pay 1
it 1
in 1
his 1
name 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
tolerated. 1

It 1
must 1
be 1
exacted 1
from 1
him 1
directly 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
vilify 1
and 1
humiliate 1
him, 1
so 1
that 1
Islam 1
and 1
its 1
people 1
may 1
be 1
exalted 1
and 1
the 1
race 1
of 1
infidels 1
brought 1
low. 1

The 1
jizya 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
imposed 1
on 1
all 1
of 1
them 1
in 1
full, 1
without 1
exception. 1

Underlying 0
this 0
subjugation 0
is 0
a 0
deep 0
contempt 0
for 0
non-Muslims. 0

In 0
the 0
year 0
718, 0
the 1
Umayyad 1
caliph 1
Umar 1
ibn 1
Abd 1
al-Aziz 1
sent 1
out 1
a 1
message 1
to 1
the 1
governors 1
of 1
the 1
various 1
Islamic 1
provinces: 1

O 1
you 1
who 1
believe! 1

The 1
non-Muslims 1
are 1
nothing 1
but 1
dirt. 1

Allah 1
has 1
created 1
them 1
to 1
be 1
partisans 1
of 1
Satan; 1
most 1
treacherous 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
all 1
they 1
do; 1
whose 1
whole 1
endeavor 1
in 1
this 1
nether 1
life 1
is 1
useless, 1
though 1
they 1
themselves 1
imagine 1
that 1
they 1
are 1
doing 1
fine 1
work. 1

Upon 1
them 1
rests 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
Allah, 1
of 1
the 1
Angels 1
and 1
of 1
man 1
collectively 1

We 0
must 0
not 0
think 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
at 1
war 1
with 1
the 1
entire 1
religion. 1

But 1
what, 1
Mr. 1
Farage, 1
are 1
we 1
to 1
think 1
about 1
the 1
Muslims 1
who 1
consider 1
themselves 1
and 1
their 1
religion 1
to 1
be 1
at 1
war 1
with 1
us? 1

Nigel 1

become 1
just 1
another 1
mainstream 1
hack 1

in 0

on 0

This 0
just 0
continues 0
the 0
pattern. 0

I 0
wrote 0
about 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
Sarah 0
Halimi 0
last 0
year. 0

Sarah 0
Lucy 0
Halimi 0
was 0
thrown 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
the 0
third 0
floor 0
Paris 0
apartment 0
while 0
she 0
begged 0
her 0
Muslim 1
killer 1
to 0
spare 0
her 0
life. 0

The 0
66-year-old 0
director 0
of 0
an 0
Orthodox 0
Jewish 0
nursery 0
was 0
woken 0
from 0
her 0
sleep 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
violently 1
beaten 1
by 0
her 0
twenty 0
something 0
Muslim 0
neighbor 0
who 0
then 0
dragged 0
her 0
to 0
the 0
window. 0

She 0
died 0
on 0
the 0
street 0
outside 0
the 0
building 0
where 0
she 0
had 0
lived 0
for 0
thirty 0
years. 0

The 0
killer 0
had 0
allegedly 0
shouted, 0
“Allahu 0
Akbar”. 0

In 0
the 0
tragic 1
comedy 1
of 1
denial 1
that 0
every 1
Islamic 1
terrorism 1
investigation 1
inevitably 1
becomes, 1
the 0
authorities 0
are 0
still 0
hunting 0
around 0
for 0
his 0
motiv 0
Yonathan 0
Halimi, 0
Sarah 0
Lucy’s 0
son, 0
describes 0
the 0
killer’s 0
family 0
as 0
being 0
known 0
for 0
its 0
anti-Semitism. 0

"One 0
day, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
killer's 0
sisters 0
pushed 0
my 0
sister 0
down 0
the 0
stairs, 0
and 0
the 0
next 0
time 0
she 0
called 0
her 0
a 0
dirty 1
Jew," 1
he 0
described. 0

Sarah’s 0
brother 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
killer 0
called 0
Sarah 0
and 0
her 0
daughter, 0
“dirty 1
Jews”. 1

The 0
authorities 0
stonewalled 1
at 0
every 0
turn. 0

And, 0
predictably, 0
the 0
killer 0
gets 0
a 0
pass. 0

Allahu 0
Akbar 0
usually 0
means 0
motive 0
unknown. 0

The 0
28-year-old 0
Muslim 0
man 0
confessed 0
to 0
the 0
killing 0
and 0
was 0
heard 0
shouting 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar” 1
and 0
calling 0
Halimi 0
“Satan” 1
shortly 0
before 0
throwing 0
her 0
out 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
her 0
three-story 0
apartment. 0

In 0
January, 0
Traore 0
was 0
determined 0
to 0
be 0
fit 0
to 0
stand 0
trial. 0

He 0
was 0
placed 0
in 0
a 0
psychiatric 0
hospital 0
for 0
weeks 0
after 0
his 0
arrest 0
in 0
the 0
April 0
2017 0
killing 0
despite 0
having 0
no 0
history 0
of 0
mental 0
illness. 0

But 0
a 0
judge 0
requested 0
a 0
second 0
series 0
of 0
tests, 0
which 0
determined 0
that 0
the 0
Malian 0
immigrant 0
was 0
not 0
able 0
to 0
stand 0
trial, 0
20 0
Minutes 0
reported 0
Wednesday. 0

This 0
tired 1
farce 1
has 0
dragged 0
on. 0

Kobili 0
Traore 0
was 0
hit 1
with 0
hate 0
crimes 0
charges. 0

Then 0
they 0
were 0
dropped. 0

The 1
authorities 1
allowed 1
him 1
to 1
commit 1
the 1
crime. 1

Now 0
they're 0
letting 0
him 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
it. 0

Three 0
minutes 0
later, 0
a 0
unit 0
of 0
the 0
Anti-Crime 0
Brigade 0
(BAC) 0
— 0
who 0
happened 0
to 0
be 0
patrolling 0
the 0
area 0
— 0
took 0
up 0
position 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
Diara’s 0
door. 0

They 0
heard 0
Kobili 0
Traore 0
chanting 0
Muslim 0
prayers 0
and 0
Koranic 0
verses. 0

Unsure 0
about 0
the 0
situation 0
and 0
the 0
potential 0
threats 0
to 0
the 0
family, 0
they 0
asked 0
for 0
reinforcements. 0

Additional 0
policemen 0
arrived 0
quickly. 0

However, 0
for 0
some 0
unclear 0
reason, 0
the 0
BAC 0
unit 0
still 0
refrained 0
from 0
breaking 0
in. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Kobili 0
Traore 0
put 0
on 0
new 0
clothes 0
and 0
climbed 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window 0
to 0
reach 0
Sarah 0
Halimi’s 0
apartment, 0
which 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
level 0
as 0
Diara 0
Traore’s. 0

He 0
allegedly 0
assaulted 0
the 0
Jewish 0
woman 0
and 0
hit 1
her 1
mercilessly. 1

From 0
time 0
to 0
time 0
he 0
resumed 0
Koranic 0
recitation. 0

Many 0
neighbours, 0
woken 0
by 0
the 0
old 0
woman’s 0
screams 0
or 0
the 0
assaulter’s 0
religious 0
chanting, 0
called 0
the 0
police 0
Some 0
gave 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
exact 0
location 0
of 0
the 0
assault, 0
the 0
attacker’s 0
identity, 0
the 0
fact 0
he 0
vilified 0
his 0
victim 0
as 0
a 0
Jewish 0
person 0
and 0
as 0
“a 1
Satan” 1
while 0
hitting 0
her, 0
or 0
even 0
— 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
Muslim 0
neighbours 0
were 0
concerned 0
— 0
the 0
Koranic 0
portions 0
he 0
chanted. 0

Yet 0
the 0
police 0
still 0
failed 0
to 0
storm 0
Sarah 0
Halimi’s 0
apartment 0
and 0
rescue 0
her. 0

Eventually, 0
Kobili 0
Traore 0
is 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
shouted 0
that 0
the 0
woman 0
was 0
“mad 0
and 0
about 0
to 0
commit 0
suicide”, 0
and 0
threw 0
her 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
window. 0

He 0
had 0
time 0
enough 0
to 0
climb 0
back 0
to 0
Diara 0
Traore’s 0
apartment 0
where 0
he 0
finally 0
was 0
arrested. 0

His 0
hands 0
were 0
covered 0
in 0
blood. 0

There 0
was 0
blood 0
everywhere 0
in 0
his 0
victim’s 0
apartment. 0

Sure 0
he 0
was 0
crazy. 1

So 0
crazy 0
he 0
tried 0
to 0
contrive 0
an 0
alibi 0
for 0
his 0
crime. 0

Kobili 0
isn't 0
crazy. 1

But 0
the 0
system 0
that 0
keeps 0
on 0
protecting 0
him 0
is. 0

Wait! 0
Wait! 0

It’s 0
all 0
a 0
MISTRANSLATION! 0

Thus, 0

it 0
took 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year-and-a-half 0
for 0
the 0
Factory 0
to 0
roll 0
out 0
the 1
old 1
reliable 1
“mistranslation” 1
defense 0
to 0
explain 0
away 0
the 0
infamous 0
paragraph 0
303 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetita 0
(AL), 0
which 0
reads 0
as 0
follows 0
in 0
the 0
official 0
English 0
translation 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website: 0

Yet 0
conscience 0
can 0
do 0
more 0
than 0
recognize 0
that 0
a 0
given 0
situation 0
does 0
not 0
correspond 0
objectively 0
to 0
the 0
overall 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel. 0

It 0
can 0
also 0
recognize 0
with 0
sincerity 0
and 0
honesty 0
what 0
for 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
generous 0
response 0
which 0
can 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
God, 0
and 0
come 0
to 0
see 0
with 0
a 0
certain 0
moral 0
security 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
what 0
God 0
himself 0
is 0
asking 0
amid 0
the 0
concrete 0
complexity 0
of 0
one’s 0
limits, 0
while 0
yet 0
not 0
fully 0
the 0
objective 0
ideal. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
the 0
conscience 0
can 0
“inform” 0
a 0
sinner 0
that 0
his 0
continued 0
sinning 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
acceptable 0
to 0
God 0
but 0
is 0
even 0
what 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
“for 0
now,” 0
given 0
one’s 0
particular 0
“limits.” 0
This 0
outrageous 0
proposition, 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
situation 0
ethics 0
that 0
strikes 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
foundation 0
of 0
Catholic 0
moral 0
teaching, 0
has 0
justly 0
provoked 0
a 0
storm 0
of 0
criticism 0
from 0
lay 0
and 0
clerical 0
defenders 0
of 0
the 0
authentic 0
Magisterium. 0

But 0

it’s 0
all 0
a 0
misunderstanding, 0
say 0
Dr. 0

what 0

what? 0

Well, 0
according 0
to 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein, 0
while 0
the 0
English 0
translation 0
reads: 0
“what 0
for 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
generous 0
response 0
which 0
can 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
God,” 0
the 0
Latin 0
employs 0
the 0
word 0
oblationem, 0
which 0
means 0
offering. 0

So, 0
What 0
the 0
Pope 0
Really 0
Means® 0
is: 0
“what 0
for 0
now 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
generous 0
offering 0
which 0
can 0
be 0
given 0
to 0
God.” 0
So, 0
it’s 0
an 0
offering 0
to 0
God, 0
not 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
God. 0

Big 0
difference. 0

But 0

just 0
a 0
moment: 0
how 0
can 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior 0
ever 0
be 0
characterized 0
as 0
an 0
“offering” 0
to 0
God? 0

It 0
would 0
seem 0
the 0
Latin 0
version 0
has 0
graver 0
implications 0
than 0
the 0
English 0
because 0
it 0
suggests 0
that 0
falling 0
short 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
moral 0
law 0
requires 0
is 0
an 0
oblation 0
pleasing 0
to 0
God 0
if 0
one’s 0
“limits” 0
make 0
obedience 0
to 0
the 0
moral 0
law 0
difficult. 0

And 1
that 1
is 1
exactly 1
the 1
nonsense 1
Fastiggi 1
and 1
Goldstein 1
expect 1
us 1
to 1
swallow: 1
“Pope 0
Francis 0
is 0
not 0
talking 0
about 0
an 0
offering 0
of 0
an 0
objectively 0
sinful 0
action 0
but 0
a 0
gift 0
of 0
self 0
that 0
moves 0
toward 0
God 0
and 0
the 0
objective 0
moral 0
norm.” 0

So, 0

our 1
intrepid 1
presenters 1
of 0
What 0
the 0
Pope 0
Really 0
Means® 0
would 0
have 0
us 0
believe 0
that 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior, 0
which 0
is 0
the 0
best 0
one 0
can 0
do 0
according 0
“the 0
“concrete 0
complexity 0
of 0
one’s 0
limits,” 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
simply 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior 0
but 0
rather 0
a 0
gift 0
of 0
self 0
because 0
it 0
moves 0
toward 0
morally 0
licit 0
behavior. 0

Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
have 0
managed 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
problem 0
even 0
worse 0
in 0
their 0
attempt 0
to 0
explain 0
it 0
away. 0

What 0

about 0
the 0
English 0
locution 0
“while 0
yet 0
not 0
fully 0
the 0
objective 0
ideal,” 0
which 0
seems 0
to 0
reduce 0
the 0
negative 0
precepts 0
of 0
the 0
natural 0
law 0
to 0
mere 0
ideals? 0

Not 0
so, 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
contend. 0

Do 0
not 0
all 1
those 1
ignorant 1
critics 1
of 1
AL 1
know 0
that 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
employs 0
the 0
phrase 0
“obiectivum 0
exemplar,” 0
which, 0
translated 0
literally 0
into 0
English 0
is 0
“objective 0
exemplar.” 0
They 0
declare 0
triumphantly: 0
“The 0
Latin 0
term 0
exemplar 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
an 0
unattainable 0
ideal, 0
it 0
specifically 0
means 0
a 0
pattern 0
or 0
model 0
to 0
follow.” 0

Give. 0

Me. 0

A. 0

Break. 0

A 0

pattern 0
or 0
model 0
to 0
follow 0
is 0
an 0
ideal, 0
as 0
a 0
standard 0
Latin 0
dictionary 0
confirms 0
with 0
its 0
definition 0
of 0
exemplar: 0
“(1) 0
copy/reproduction, 0
(2) 0
model, 0
pattern, 0
example, 0
original, 0
ideal. 0

Likewise, 0
the 0
definition 0
of 0
the 0
English 0
word 0
“exemplar” 0
is 0
simply: 0
“an 0
ideal 0
model.” 0

Here 0

too 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldsetein 0
only 0
worsen 0
the 0
problem 0
they 0
try 0
to 0
explain 0
away. 0

For 0
if 0
moral 0
behavior 0
is 0
now 0
to 0
be 0
viewed 0
as 0
merely 0
“exemplary” 0
rather 0
than 0
divinely 0
mandated 0
by 0
the 0
natural 0
law 0
that 0
binds 0
all 0
men—including 0
Thou 0
Shalt 0
Not 0
Commit 0
Adultery—then 0
basic 0
morality 0
becomes 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
heroic 0
virtue. 0

Thus, 0
continence 0
cannot 0
realistically 0
be 0
expected, 0
at 0
least 0
“for 0
now” 0
(AL 0
303), 0
of 0
the 0
average 0
Joe 0
or 0
Jane 0
with 0
an 0
“ex” 0
who 0
has 0
“remarried” 0
and 0
is 0
now 0
mired 0
in 0
the 0
“concrete 0
complexity 0
one’s 0
limits.” 0

So, 0

as 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
would 0
have 0
it, 0
all 1
the 1
tumult 1
triggered 1
by 1
AL 1
is 1
just 1
a 1
misunderstanding 1
caused 1
by 1
uninformed 1
people 1
who 1
haven’t 1
consulted 1
the 1
Latin 1
text—including 0
those 1
ignorant 1
Vatican 1
translators. 1

According 0
to 0
their 0
proposed 0
“alternate 0
translation” 0
into 0
English, 0
What 0
the 0
Pope 0
Really 0
Means® 0
is 0
that 0
objectively 0
immoral 0
behavior 0
one 0
feels 0
unable 0
to 0
correct 0
due 0
to 0
one’s 0
“limits” 0
is 0
“the 0
offering 0
that 0
God 0
himself 0
is 0
asking 0
amid 0
the 0
mass 0
of 0
impediments, 0
although 0
it 0
may 0
not 0
yet 0
be 0
the 0
perfect 0
objective 0
model.” 0
Which 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
official 0
English 0
translation 0
already 0
says 0
but 0
with 0
fewer 0
words. 0

It 0

seems 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
are 0
hoping 0
no 0
one 0
will 0
notice 0
that 0
their 0
linguistic 0
tinkering 0
produces 0
no 0
real 0
change 0
in 0
meaning 0
but 0
only 0
an 0
intensification 0
of 0
its 0
perniciousness. 0

Indeed, 0
their 0
“proposed 0
alternate 0
translation” 0
reduces 0
the 0
avoidance 0
of 0
adulterous 0
relations 0
in 0
“second 0
marriages” 0
to 0
the 0
“perfect 0
objective 0
model.” 0
Now, 0
how 0
could 0
anyone 0
but 0
a 0
Pharisee 0
expect 0
perfection 0
from 0
people 0
living 0
in 0
adultery? 0

Are 0
you 0
perfect? 0

Then 0
again, 0
the 0
Pharisees 0
are 0
precisely 0
the 0
ones 0
Our 0
Lord 0
condemned 0
for 0
accommodating 0
divorce 0
and 0
remarriage 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
natural 0
law. 0

But 1
such 1
embarrassing 1
truths 1
need 1
not 1
impede 1
the 1
Bergoglian 1
Mercy 1
Train 1
as 1
it 1
barrels 1
toward 1
a 1
train 1
wreck 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
line. 1

And 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
are 0
busily 0
helping 0
it 0
along, 0
changing 0
red 0
signals 0
to 0
green. 0

No 0
problem 0
here! 0

has 0
been 0
the 0
mantra 0
of 0
the 0
neo-Catholic 0
establishment 0
for 0
nearly 0
half 0
a 0
century 0
of 0
ecclesial 0
auto-demolition. 0

But 1

wait, 1
there’s 1
more! 1

Our 1
dynamic 1
translators 1
even 0
provide 0
their 0
own 0
dynamic 0
interpretation 0
of 0
AL 0
to 0
mean 0
that 0
the 0
“offering” 0
to 0
God 0
of 0
which 0
Francis 0
speaks 0
is 0
merely 0
the 0
decision 0
by 0
a 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
couple 0
with 0
children 0
not 0
to 0
end 0
their 0
relationship, 0
which 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
“perfect 0
objective 0
model,” 0
but 0
rather 0
to 0
“live 0
in 0
continence 0
until 0
they 0
may—after 0
the 0
hoped 0
for 0
declaration 0
of 0
nullity—enter 0
into 0
a 0
true 0
marriage.” 0
That 0
is, 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
Francis 0
affirming 0
John 0
Paul 0
II’s 0
Familiaris 0
consortio, 0
which 0
repeats 0
the 0
Church’s 0
constant 0
teaching 0
that 0
continence 0
is 0
required 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
entered 0
into 0
adulterous 0
“second 0
marriage,” 0
failing 0
which 0
they 0
cannot 0
be 0
admitted 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments. 0

But 0

the 0
Fastiggi-Goldstein 0
interpretation 0
is 0
precisely 0
the 0
contrary 0
of 0
the 0
interpretation 0
Francis 0
has 0
assiduously 0
promoted 0
and 0
which 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
just 0
as 0
assiduously 0
ignore: 0
i.e., 0
that 0
people 0
in 0
“second 0
marriages” 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
continence, 0
but 0
rather—in 0
“certain 0
cases”—may 0
continue 0
their 0
adulterous 0
relations 0
while 0
receiving 0
absolution 0
and 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
during 0
a 0
“process 0
of 0
discernment.” 0
As 0
we 0
know, 0
in 0
his 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
published 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican 0
website 0
(in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
query 0
he 0
himself 0
may 0
have 0
solicited), 0
Bergoglio 0
informed 0
them 0
“there 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
interpretation.” 0

Moreover, 0

the 0
Maltese 0
bishops' 0
“guidelines” 0
for 0
implementing 0
AL, 0
published 0
in 0
L’Osservatore 0
Romano—for 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
thanked 0
them—declare 0
thus: 0

If, 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
of 0
discernment, 0
undertaken 0
with 0
“humility, 0
discretion 0
and 0
love 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
her 0
teaching, 0
in 0
a 0
sincere 0
search 0
for 0
God’s 0
will 0
and 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
more 0
perfect 0
response 0
to 0
it” 0
(AL 0
300), 0
a 0
separated 0
or 0
divorced 0
person 0
who 0
is 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
new 0
relationship 0
manages, 0
with 0
an 0
informed 0
and 0
enlightened 0
conscience, 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
and 0
believe 0
that 0
he 0
or 0
she 0
are 0
at 0
peace 0
with 0
God, 0
he 0
or 0
she 0
cannot 0
be 0
precluded 0
from 0
participating 0
in 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
(see 0
AL, 0
notes 0
336 0
and 0
351). 0

This 0
Pope’s 0
plan 0
of 0
promulgating 0
a 0
deliberately 0
ambiguous 0
document 0
whose 0
heterodox 0
interpretation 0
and 0
application 0
he 0
would 0
later 0
approve 0
with 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
sub-magisterial 0
winks 0
and 0
nods, 0
both 0
oral 0
and 0
written, 0
is 0
the 0
reason 0
I 0
signed 0
onto 0
the 0
Correctio 0
Filialis. 0

See 0
the 0
piece 0
by 0
Joseph 0
Shaw 0
in 0
this 0
regard. 0

Shaw 0

maintains 0
that 0
AL 0
can 0
be 0
“bent 0
into 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
orthodoxy.” 0
Perhaps. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
our 0
responsibility 0
to 0
bend 0
a 0
Pope’s 0
statements 0
into 0
conformity 0
with 0
the 0
Faith. 0

Moreover, 0
any 0
Pope 0
who 0
promulgates 0
a 0
document 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
read 0
as 0
orthodox 0
only 0
by 0
a 0
forced 0
interpretation 0
imposed 0
by 0
certain 0
readers—while 0
others 0
disagree—has 0
by 0
that 0
very 0
fact 0
inflicted 0
grave 0
harm 0
upon 0
on 0
the 0
Church, 0
which 0
he 0
alone 0
has 0
the 0
duty 0
to 0
correct. 0

But 0
Francis, 0
as 0
any 0
reasonable 0
observer 0
can 0
see, 0
has 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
offering 0
any 0
such 0
correction. 0

Quite 0
to 0
the 0
contrary, 0
confusion 0
as 0
a 0
cover 0
for 0
the 0
introduction 0
of 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
for 1
“certain” 1
public 1
adulterers 1
by 0
Bergoglio’s 0
co-conspirators 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
and 0
various 0
dioceses 0
is 0
exactly 0
what 0
he 0
was 0
aiming 0
to 0
achieve 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
whole 0
synodal 1
charade, 1
which 0
was 0
merely 0
a 0
vehicle 0
for 0
promulgation 0
of 0
AL. 0

As 0
Shaw 0
observes 0
of 0
AL: 0
“What 0
we 0
[the 0
signers 0
of 0
the 0
Correctio] 0
are 0
saying 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
has 0
become 0
clear 0
that 0
orthodoxy 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
wants 0
us 0
to 0
find 0
there.” 0

In 1

a 1
sense, 1
what 1
Bergoglio 1
is 1
doing 1
is 1
worse 1
than 1
explicit 1
heresy, 1
which 0
could 0
at 0
least 0
be 0
readily 0
identified 0
and 0
denounced 0
as 0
such. 0

But 0
Bergoglio 0
wants 0
the 0
effects 0
of 0
heresy—undermining 0
Holy 0
Matrimony, 0
Confession 0
and 0
Holy 0
Communion, 0
whose 0
integrity 0
is 0
affirmed 0
verbally—without 0
the 0
guilt 0
of 0
an 0
explicit 0
promulgation. 0

In 0
so 0
acting, 0
he 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
in 0
the 0
mold 0
of 0
Honorius 0
I, 0
who 0
was 0
posthumously 0
anathematized 0
by 0
an 0
ecumenical 0
council 0
(the 0
Third 0
Council 0
of 0
Constantinople) 0
and 0
by 0
his 0
own 0
successor 0
(Leo 0
II) 0
for 0
aiding 0
and 0
abetting 0
the 0
spread 0
of 0
the 0
Monothelite 0
heresy 0
(no 0
human 0
but 0
only 0
a 0
divine 0
will 0
in 0
Christ). 0

Honorius 0
did 0
so 0
by 0
means 0
of 0
private 0
correspondence 0
with 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
heresy, 0
endorsing 0
the 0
heresy 0
without 0
ever 0
formally 0
proclaiming 0
it 0
as 0
doctrine. 0

And 0
yet 0
Honorius 0
I 0
is 0
listed 0
in 0
the 0
canon 0
of 0
the 0
Popes 0
and 0
is 0
not 0
considered 0
to 0
have 0
fallen 0
from 0
office 0
on 0
account 0
of 0
heresy. 0

A 0
similar 0
judgment 0
might 0
well 0
befall 0
this 0
Pope, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
for 0
us 0
to 0
level 0
it. 0

Meanwhile, 0

as 0
Fastiggi 0
and 0
Goldstein 0
labor 0
to 0
convince 0
us 0
that 0
nothing 0
is 0
amiss 0
with 0
AL, 0
Pope 0
Bergoglio 0
is 0
sending 0
clear 0
signals 0
of 0
concern 0
about 0
the 0
rising 0
opposition 0
among 0
the 0
faithful 0
to 0
his 0
master 0
plan 0
to 0
subvert 0
the 0
Church 0
according 0
to 0
his 0
false 0
notion 0
of 0
mercy. 0

In 0
a 0
classic 0
power 0
move, 0
he 0
has 0
just 0
given 0
a 0
sop 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Burke, 0
the 0
perceived 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
opposition, 0
by 0
appointing 0
him 0
to 0
a 0
minor 0
position 0
on 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Signatura—the 0
same 0
tribunal 0
from 0
which 0
Bergoglio 0
brutally 0
removed 0
him 0
as 0
Prefect. 0

And 0
this 0
after 0
also 0
humiliating 0
Burke 0
as 0
the 0
spiritual 0
patron 0
of 0
the 0
Knights 0
of 0
Malta, 0
to 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
exiled 0
after 0
his 0
removal. 0

Will 0

this 0
sop 0
buy 0
Burke’s 0
silence, 0
staving 0
off 0
the 0
feared 0
public 0
correction? 0

We 0
will 0
soon 0
know 0
if 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
can 0
be 0
bought 0
so 0
easily. 0

But 0
this 0
move 0
demonstrates—if 0
more 0
evidence 0
were 0
needed—that 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
the 1
humble 1
apostle 1
of 1
mercy 1
depicted 1
in 1
his 1
carefully 1
crafted 1
public 1
relations 1
narrative, 1
but 1
rather 1
a 1
cunning 1
ecclesiastical 1
politician, 1
constantly 1
plotting 1
and 1
scheming 1
to 1

WASHINGTON 0
— 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
has 0
a 0
message 0
for 0
Donald 0
Trump: 0
You’re 1
wrong, 1
Mr. 1
President. 1

Sessions 0
long 0
has 0
been 0
one 1
of 1
Trump’s 1
favorite 1
pinatas, 1
often 0
taking 0
the 0
brunt 0
of 0
the 1
president’s 1
public 1
scorn. 1

Trump 0
offered 0
this 0
assessment 0
of 0
his 0
hand-picked 0
attorney 0
general 0
recusing 0
himself 0
from 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department’s 0
special 0
counsel 0
probe 0
of 0
Russian 0
election 0
meddling: 0
“What 1
kind 1
of 1
man 1
is 1
this?” 1

Trump, 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
that 0
aired 0
Thursday 0
morning, 0
also 0
blasted 1
Sessions 0
because, 0
he 0
said, 0
the 1
former 1
Alabama 1
senator 1
“never 1
took 1
control 1
of 1
the 1
Justice 1
Department.” 1

About 0
seven 0
hours 0
later, 0
the 0
country’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officer 0
fired 1
back. 1

And, 0
by 0
doing 0
so, 0
took 0
on 0
Trump 0
publicly 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
few 0
Republicans 0
in 0
Washington 0
have 0
during 0
his 0
turbulent 0
19-month-old 0
presidency. 0

“I 0
took 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
the 0
day 0
I 0
was 0
sworn 0
in, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
we 0
have 0
had 0
unprecedented 1
success 1
at 1
effectuating 1
the 1
President’s 1
agenda 1
— 0
one 1
that 1
protects 1
the 1
safety 1
and 1
security 1
and 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
people, 1
reduces 1
violent 1
crime, 1
enforces 1
our 1
immigration 1
laws, 1
promotes 1
economic 1
growth, 1
and 1
advances 1
religious 1
liberty,” 1
the 0
AG 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“While 0
I 0
am 0
Attorney 0
General, 0
the 0
actions 0
of 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
improperly 0
influenced 0
by 0
political 0
considerations. 0

I 0
demand 0
the 0
highest 0
standards, 0
and 0
where 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
met, 0
I 0
take 0
action,” 0
Sessions 0
added. 0

“However, 1
no 1
nation 1
has 1
a 1
more 1
talented, 1
more 1
dedicated 1
group 1
of 1
law 1
enforcement 1
investigators 1
and 1
prosecutors 1
than 1
the 1
United 1
States.” 1

That 0
last 0
statement 0
comes 0
amid 0
nearly 1
constant 1
complaints 1
from 1
Trump 1
that 0
Justice 0
Department 0
and 0
FBI 0
investigators 0
are 0
being 0
unfair 0
to 0
the 0
president 0
and 0
his 0
allies. 0

That 0
line 0
of 0
criticism 0
has 0
been 0
picked 0
up 0
by, 0
among 0
others, 0
Rep. 0
Duncan 0
Hunter, 0
R-Calif., 0
who 0
was 0
indicted 0
on 0
federal 0
officials 0
this 0
week 0
on 0
charges 0
of 0
misusing 0
campaign 0
finance 0
funds 0
for 0
personal 0
use. 0

Trump 0
did 0
not 0
directly 0
answer 0
a 0
Fox 0
News 0
interviewer’s 0
question 0
about 0
whether 0
he 0
intends 0
to 0
fire 0
Sessions 0
and 0
Deputy 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein, 0
who 0
is 0
overseeing 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
investigation, 0
after 0
November’s 0
congressional 0
elections. 0

He 0
also 0
said 0
he 0
only 0
gave 0
the 0
former 0
senator 0
the 0
job 0
because 0
Sessions 0
was 0
a 0
supporter 0
during 0

Some 0
Farrakhan 0
quotes: 0

“The 0
Jews 0
don’t 0
like 0
Farrakhan, 0
so 0
they 0
call 0
me 0
Hitler. 0

Well, 0
that’s 1
a 1
good 1
name. 1

Hitler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
man.” 1

“My 1
god 1
will 1
wipe 1
this 1
country 1
(America) 1
from 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
earth.” 1

On 0
on 0
the 0
Jewish 0
people: 0
“You 1
are 1
wicked 1
deceivers 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

You 1
have 1
sucked 1
their 1
blood.” 1

“The 1
Jews 1
don’t 1
like 1
Farrakhan, 1
so 1
they 1
call 1
me 1
Hitler. 1

Well, 0
that’s 1
a 1
good 1
name. 1

Hitler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
great 1
man.” 1

“You 0
are 0
not 0
now, 0
nor 0
have 0
you 0
ever 0
been 0
a 0
citizen 0
of 0
America. 0

You 0
are 0
a 0
slave 0
to 0

“America 1
is 1
in 1
trouble, 1
and 1
I 1
say 1
God 1
is 1
about 1
to 1
wipe 1
this 1
nation 1
from 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
the 1
Earth. 1

I’m 1
not 1
crazy, 1
I’m 1
not 1
drunk, 1
how 1
long 1
do 1
you 1
think 1
a 1
nation 1
can 1
do 1
evil 1
and 1
not 1
face 1
the 1
wrath 1
of 1
god?” 1

“You 0
see 0
everybody 0
always 0
talk 0
about 0
Hitler 1
exterminating 1
six 1
million 1
Jews. 1

That’s 0
right. 0

But 1
don’t 1
nobody 1

ask 1
what 1
did 1
they 1

to 1

forcing 0

on 0

According 0
to 0
the 0

Daily 0
News, 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh, 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee, 0
held 0
a 0
woman 0
down, 0
covered 0
her 0
mouth 0
and 0
tried 0
to 0
force 0
himself 0
on 0
her 0
while 0
drunk 0
at 0
a 0
party 0
in 0
high 0
school. 0

That’s 0
the 0
nexus 0
of 0
a 0
letter 0
allegedly 0
acquired 0
by 0
Democrat 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
in 0
July 0
but 0
dropped 0
on 0
the 0
last 0
days 0
before 0
the 0
vote 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
confirmation. 0

The 0
unidentified 0
woman 0
says 0
the 0
incident 0
took 0
place 0
at 0
a 0
party 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s 0
while 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
a 0
student 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Preparatory 0
School 0
in 0
Bethesda, 0
Md., 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
NYDN, 0
which 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
obtained 0
the 0
letter 0
on 0
Friday. 0

She 0
alleges 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
a 0
friend 0
of 0
his, 0
both 0
of 0
whom 0
had 0
been 0
drinking, 0
cornered 0
her 0
in 0
a 0
room 0
and 0
turned 0
up 0
the 0
music 0
to 0
blur 0
out 0
the 0
sound 0
of 0
her 0
protests. 0

Kavanaugh 0
then 0
allegedly 0
covered 0
the 0
woman’s 0
mouth 0
with 0
his 0
hand 0
and 0
attempted 0
to 0
force 0
himself 0
on 0
her, 0
but 0
she 0
says 0
she 0
managed 0
to 0
free 0
herself 0
and 0
bolt 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
room. 0

Kavanaugh, 0
53, 0
vehemently 1
denied 1
the 0
woman’s 0
allegations. 0

“I 0
categorically 1
and 1
unequivocally 1
deny 1
this 1
allegation,” 1
he 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“I 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
this 0
back 0
in 0
high 0
school 0
or 0
at 0
any 0
time.” 0

Kavanaugh’s 0

who 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
identified, 0
did 0
not 0
outright 0
deny 0
the 0
woman’s 0
claims 0
but 0
told 0
the 0
New 0
Yorker 0
he 0
has 0
“no 0
recollection 0
of 0
that.” 0

The 0
woman 0
says 0
she 0
has 0
had 0
to 0
undergo 0
psychological 0
treatment 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
incident. 0

woman’s 0
letter 0
was 0
in 0

it 0
with 0

that 0

the 0

an 1

The 0
official 0
diocesan 0
newspaper, 0

announced 0
on 0
February 0
9 0
that 0
in 0
two 0
different 0
parishes 0
in 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Linz 0
homosexual 0

were 0
explicitly 0
invited 0
to 0

a 0
Church 0
blessing 0
on 0
St. 0
Valentine's 0
Day. 0

As 0
is 0
explained 0
in 0
the 0
article: 0

St. 0
Valentine 0
is 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
saint 0
of 0
friendship 0
and 0
of 0
love. 0

In 0
many 0
parishes 0
and 0
ecclesial 0
institutions, 0
it 0
is 0
already 0
tradition 0
to 0
offer 0
blessings 0
of 0
couples 0
around 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
his 0
feast 0
day. 0

People 0
in 0
homosexual 0
relationships 0
are 0
welcome 0
at 0
the 0
blessing 0
ceremonies 0
in 0
Wels-St. 0
Franziskus 0
[Church] 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
Ursulinenkirche. 0

Paul 0
Stütz, 0
the 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
article, 0
explains 0
that 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
couples 0
“offers 0
an 0
occasion 0
to 0
express 0
love.” 0

“The 0
blessing 0
expresses 0
that 0
one 0
is 0
welcomed 0
by 0
one's 0
partner 0
and 0
by 0
God.” 0
At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
his 0
article, 0
he 0
adds 0
a 0
link 0
to 0
another 0
report 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
Reinhard 0
Marx's 0
recent 0
3 0
February 0
interview 0
showing 0
his 0
openness 0
to 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
blessings 0
of 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
in 0
individual 0
cases 0
as 0
decided 0
by 0
a 0
pastor. 0

Stütz 1
also 1
quotes 1
in 1
the 1
article 1
itself 1
Father 1
Franz 1
Harant, 1
“a 1
pastoral 1
worker 1
in 1
the 1
field 1
of 1
marriage 1
and 1
the 1
family” 1
at 1
the 1
Ursulinenkirche 1
in 1
Linz. 1

Harant 1
himself 1
shows 1
himself 1
a 1
supporter 1
of 1
blessings 1
for 1
homosexual 1
couples, 1
and 1
he 1
makes 1
here 1
an 1
explicit 1
reference 1
to 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia. 1

As 0
Stütz 0
reports: 0

We 0

universally 0
available 0
blessing. 0

There, 0
we 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
forbid,” 0
says 0
Harant. 0

He 1
sees 1
himself 1
in 1
this 1
in 1
union 1
with 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
who 1
himself 1
says 1
in 1
his 1
magisterial 1
document 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia 1
that 1
“each 1
person, 1
independent 1
of 1
his 1
sexual 1
orientation, 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
respected 1
in 1
his 1
dignity 1
and 1
welcomed 1
with 1
respect. 1

As 0
the 0
Austrian 0
Catholic 0
website 0
Kath.net 0
writes, 0
Harant 0
must 0
be 0
quoting 0
here 0
AL 0
250. 0

Irmgard 0
Lehner, 0
the 0
pastoral 0
assistant 0
of 0
the 0
Wels-St. 0
Franziskus 0
Church, 0
the 0
other 0
of 0
the 0
two 0
parishes 0
that 0
welcome 0
homosexual 0
couples, 0
appreciates 0
this 0
blessing 0
ritual 0
for 0
Valentine's 0
Day, 0
saying 0
it 1
has 1
“an 1
enormous 1
power.” 1
During 0
the 0
ceremony, 0
couples 0
come 0
forward 0
in 0
church 0
and 0
receive 0
a 0
hand 0
on 0
their 0
foreheads 0
and 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
the 0
cross. 0

“We 0
thus 0
stress 0
the 0
high 0
value 0
of 0
relationships,” 0
explains 0
Lehner. 0

As 0
the 0
KirchenZeitung 0
journalist 0
adds: 0
“This 0
offer 0
can 0
be 0
accepted 0
by 0
lovers 0
in 0
all 0
kinds 0
of 0
life 0
situations 0
– 0
also 0
by 0
lesbians 0
and 0
homosexuals.” 0
Lehner, 0
who 0
is 0
herself 0
a 0
theologian, 0
regrets 0
that, 0
so 0
far, 0
no 0
homosexual 0
couple 0
has 0
come 0
for 0
the 0
blessing. 0

“Here 0
with 0
us, 0
everybody 0
should 0
feel 0
welcome, 0
just 0
as 0
he 0
or 0
she 0
is.” 0
The 0
pastoral 0
assistant 0
adds 0
that 0
“God 0
is 0
love. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
restrictions.” 0

The 0
Diocesan 0
Working 0
Group 0
on 0
Pastoral 0
Care 0
for 0
Homosexuals 0
(dahop) 0
is 0
rejoicing 0
about 0
such 0
a 0
welcome 0
from 0
a 0
parish. 0

The 0
group 0
says 0
that 0
it 0
repeatedly 0
receives 0
requests 0
from 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
who 0
wish 0
to 0
“receive 0
a 0
blessing 0
in 0
the 0
frame 0
of 0
a 0
liturgy.” 0

The 0
KirchenZeitung 0
then 0
quotes 0
a 0
commentary, 0
saying: 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
good 0
if 0
a 0
clear 0
sign 0
of 0
openness 0
and 0
invitation 0
would 0
be 0
made 0
by 0
many 0
more 0
pastoral 0
workers 0
[male 0
and 0
female], 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
clear 0
signal 0
that 0
love 0
between 0
two 0
persons 0
with 0
equal 0
rights 0
are 0
wished 0
by 0
God 0
and 0
thus 0
already 0
blessed. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
above-quoted 0
Franz 0
Harant 0
himself 0
is 0
the 0
contact 0
person 0
of 0
this 0
Diocesan 0
Working 0
Group 0
– 0
also 0
called 0
“Rainbow 0
Pastoral.” 0
As 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
on 0
the 0
website 0
of 0
dahop, 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Linz 0
offers 0
special 0
liturgical 0
services 0
for 0
homosexuals, 0
called 0
“Queer 0
Church 0
Services” 0
(Queer-Gottesdienste) 0
that 0
take 0
place 0
in 0
Harant's 0
own 0
parish. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
clear 0
whether 0
these 0
church 0
services 0
take 0
place 0
in 0
a 0
form 0
of 0
a 0
Holy 0
Mass. 0

Similar 0
blessings 0
for 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
are 0
currently 0
taking 0
place, 0
or 0
are 0
being 0
considered, 0
also 0
in 0
Gemany, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
diocesan 0
level, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
an 0
individual 0
level. 0

As 0
LifeSiteNews 0
reported 0
in 0
January, 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Limburg 0
is 0
publicly 0
discussing 0
the 0
establishment 0
of 0
a 0
special 0
liturgical 0
rite 0
for 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
homosexuals. 0

Publicly 0
presented 0
by 0
Johannes 0
zu 0
Eltz, 0
a 0
high-ranking 0
priest 0
of 0
the 0
diocese, 0
his 0
so-called 0
Frankfurt 0
proposal 0
has 0
the 0
public 0
support 0
of 0
the 0
local 0
bishop, 0
Georg 0
Bätzing. 0

Additionally, 0
the 0
Austrian 0
Catholic 0
website 0
Kath.net 0
reports 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
Catholics 0
priests 0
in 0
two 0
different 0
German 0
dioceses 0
who 0
publicly 0
state 0
now 0
to 0
have 0
given 0
many 0
blessings 0
to 0
homosexual 0
couples. 0

Father 0
Christoph 0
Simonsen 0
(Diocese 0
of 0
Aachen) 0
says 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
blessed 0
50 0
couples 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
fifteen 0
years; 0
Father 0
Siegfried 0
Modenbach 0
(Archdiocese 0
of 0
Paderborn) 0
has 0
blessed 0
two 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
years. 0

He 0
also 0
conducts 0
church 0
services 0
for 0
homosexuals. 0

Kath.net 0
subsequently 0
contacted 0
both 0
Dioceses 0
and 0
requested 0
information 0
about 0
these 0
two 0
priests. 0

As 0
an 0
answer, 0
they 0
were 0
told 0
that 0
the 0
Diocese 0
intends 0
to 0
talk 0
with 0
the 0
concerned 0
priests, 0
but 0
that 0
this 0
matter 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
addressed 0
among 0
the 0
German 0
bishops 0
in 0
general, 0
such 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops' 0
Conference. 0

This 0
moral 0
turmoil 0
in 0
German 0
dioceses 0
has 0
provoked 0
concern 0
and 0
criticism 0
among 0
Catholics. 0

Mathias 0
von 0
Gersdorff, 0
German 0
pro-life 0
activist 0
and 0
book 0
author, 0
states 0
on 0
his 0
own 0
blog, 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Spring 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops' 0
Conference 0
will 0
become 0
crucial 0
in 0
this 0
matter. 0

As 0
he 0
sees 0
it, 0
“the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Germany 0
who 0
will 0
meet 0
next 0
week 0
for 0
the 0
Spring 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
Bishops' 0
Conference 0
find 0
themselves 0
in 0
a 0
complicated 0
situation,” 0
where 0
they 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
show 0
their 0
colors. 0

They 0
will 0
either 0
be 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church's 0
teaching 0
on 0
sexuality 0
and 0
marriage 0
and 0
forbid 0
such 0
blessings, 0
or 0
“essentially 0
accept 0
them,” 0
at 0
least 0
by 0
“saying 0
nothing.” 0

He 0
concludes: 0

Hillary 0
Cracks 1
Racist 1
Joke 1
After 0
Mixing 0
Up 0
Cory 0
Booker 0
& 0
Eric 0
Holder: 0
"They 0
All 0

Same" 0

So, 0
you 0
were 0
actually 0
asking 0
yourself 0
who 0
the 0
real 0
people 0
are 0
who 0
engage 0
in 0
identity 0
politics 0
and 0
viewing 0
people 0
with 0
different 0
skin 0
colors 0
or 0
ethnic 0
backgrounds 0
as 0
inferior 0
people? 0

Well, 0
this 0
didn't 0
come 0
from 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump. 0

Nope, 0
Former 0

it 0

with 0
a 0

"They 0
all 0

Hillary 0

“What’s 0

politeness,” 0
Clinton 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
not 0

she 0
added. 0

“And 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
it’s 0
politically 0
correct 0
to 0
say 0
we 0
value 0
that," 0
she 0
concluded. 0

"And 0
I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
go 0
around 0
insulting 0
people. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0

broad 0
brush 0
every 0

is 0
this, 0
every 0

is 0
that, 0
every, 0
you 0
know, 0
other 0
person 0
with 0
different 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
or 0
whatever 0
– 0
that’s 1
childish.” 1

Right, 0
except 0
she 0
does 0
just 0
that 0
and 0
so 0
do 0
many 0
in 0
her 0
party. 0

However, 0
in 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
minute 0
she 0
would 0
insult 0
both 0
Booker 0
and 0
Holder, 0
and 1
every 1
person 1
with 1
dark 1
skin 1
on 1
the 1
planet. 1

Swisher 0
asked 0
her, 0
"What 0
do 0
you 0
think 0
of 0
Cory 0
Booker… 0
saying 0
‘kick 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
shins,’ 1
essentially?" 0

Of 0
course, 0
Swisher 0
meant 0
Eric 0
Holder 0
and 0
Clinton 0
corrected 0
her, 0
adding, 0
“Yeah, 0
I 0
know 0
they 0
all 0
look 0
alike." 0

What 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
amazing 1
is 0
that 0
the 0
audience 0
laughed 0
hysterically. 0

Can 0
you 0
imagine 0
if 0
a 0
conservative 0
person 0
uttered 0
those 0
comments? 0

There 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
near 0
lynching 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
the 0
spot 0
and 0
surely 0
for 0
days 0
to 0
come. 0

They 0
might 0
lose 0
their 0
livelihood 0
and 0
get 0
death 0
threats, 0
but 0
not 0
"Crooked" 1
Hillary. 1

Clearly, 1
she 1
was 1
speaking 1
of 1
all 1
black 1
people 1
and 1
not 1
being 1
specific 1
to 1
Holder 1
or 1
Booker 1
as 1
they 1
look 1
nothing 1
alike. 1

The 0
only 0
thing 0
the 0
two 0
of 0
them 0
have 0
in 0
common 0
is 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
criminals 0
and 0
have 0
black 0
skin. 0

Clinton's 0
comments 0
were 0
clearly 0
racist, 0
and 0
those 0
fawning 0
over 0
her 0
during 0
the 0
interview 0
laughed 0
it 0
up 0
right 0
along 0
with 0
her. 0

Here, 0
take 0
a 0
look! 0

Disgusting 1
that 0
she 0
continues 0
to 0
move 0
and 0
speak 0
freely 0
in 0
this 0
country 0
with 0
no 0
justice 0
being 0
brought 0
to 0
bear 0
on 0
her 0
for 0
her 0
many 0
crimes, 0
something 0
we 0
were 0
promised 0
from 0
then-candidate 0
Trump. 0

The 0
Plague 0
Is 0
AIRBORNE 0
And 0
It’s 0
Spreading 0
Because 0
People 1
Are 1
Literally 1
‘Dancing 1
With 1
Corpses’ 1

The 0
plague 0
that’s 0
airborne 0
and 0
has 0
killed 0
at 0
least 0
124 0
people 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
is 0
now 0
blamed 0
on 0
“dancing 1
with 1
corpses.” 1
This 0
is 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
year 0
when 0
the 0
dead 0
are 0
wrapped 0
in 0
sheets 0
and 0
paraded 0
through 0
the 0
streets 0
while 0
others 0
dance 0
around 0
the 0
bodies. 0

The 1
local 1
tradition 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
major 1
causes 1
of 1
the 1
spread 1
of 1
this 1
disease. 1

Since 0
it’s 0
airborne, 0
anyone 0
coming 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
corpse 0
of 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
died 0
of 0
the 0
black 0
death 0
could 0
themselves, 0
catch 0
the 0
infection. 0

Health 1
officials 1
suspect 1
it’s 1
no 1
coincidence 1
that 1
the 1
outbreak 1
coincides 1
with 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
year 1
when 1
families 1
customarily 1
exhume 1
the 1
remains 1
of 1
dead 1
relatives, 1
wrap 0
them 0
in 0
a 0
sheet, 0
and 0
dance 0
with 0
them 0
through 0
the 0
streets 0
in 0
a 0
sacred 0
ritual, 0
AFP 0
reports. 0

“If 0
a 0
person 0
dies 0
of 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
and 0
is 0
then 0
interred 0
in 0
a 0
tomb 0
that 0
is 0
subsequently 0
opened 0
for 0
[the 0
ritual], 0
the 1
bacteria 1
can 1
still 1
be 1
transmitted 1
and 1
contaminate 1
whoever 1
handles 1
the 1
body,” 1
said 0
Willy 0
Randriamarotia, 0
Madagascar’s 0
health 0
ministry 0
chief 0
of 0
staff. 0

Some 1
locals 1
believe 1
the 1
whole 1
plague 1
is 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
a 1
government 1
conspiracy, 1
and 0
say 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
intention 0
of 0
forgoing 0
the 0
ritual 0
known 0
as 0
“famadihana.” 0
They 0
say 0
they 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
dance 0
with 0
the 0
dead 0
and 0
intend 0
to 0
honor 0
their 0
ancestors. 0

“I 0
will 0
always 0
practice 0
the 0
turning 0
of 0
the 0
bones 0
of 0
my 0
ancestors 0
— 0
plague 0
or 0
no 0
plague. 0

The 1
plague 1
is 1
a 1
lie,” 1
Helene 0
Raveloharisoa 0
told 0
the 0
wire 0
service. 0

Josephine 0
Ralisiarisoa 0
firmly 0
believes 0
the 0
country’s 0
cash-strapped 1
government 1
is 1
just 1
exaggerating 1
the 1
problem 1
to 1
get 1
money 1
ahead 1
of 1
an 1
election 1
next 1
year. 1

And 0
it 1
isn’t 1
that 1
anyone 1
is 1
putting 1
this 1
past 1
a 1
government 1
to 1
lie 1
for 1
profits, 1
but 0
health 0
officials 0
have 0
even 0
warned 0
tourists, 0
a 0
source 0
of 0
money, 0
to 0
stay 0
away 0
from 0
Madagascar 0
for 0
their 0

IN 0
MAY 0
2013, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post’s 0
Greg 0
Miller 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
clandestine 0
service 0
was 0
being 0
shifted 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
position 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
“a 0
management 0
shake-up” 0
by 0
then-Director 0
John 0
Brennan. 0

As 0
Miller 0
documented, 0
this 0
official 0
— 0
whom 0
the 0
paper 0
did 0
not 0
name 0
because 0
she 0
was 0
a 0
covert 0
agent 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
— 0
was 0
centrally 0
involved 0
in 0
the 1
worst 1
abuses 1
of 1
the 1
CIA’s 1
Bush-era 1
torture 1
regime. 1

As 0
Miller 0
put 0
it, 0
she 0
was 0
“directly 0
involved 0
in 0
its 0
controversial 0
interrogation 0
program” 0
and 0
had 0
an 0
“extensive 0
role” 0
in 0
torturing 0
detainees. 0

Even 0
more 0
troubling, 0
she 0
“had 0
run 0
a 0
secret 0
prison 0
in 0
Thailand” 0
— 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
network 0
of 0
“black 0
sites” 0
— 0
“where 0
two 0
detainees 0
were 0
subjected 0
to 0
waterboarding 0
and 0
other 0
harsh 1
techniques.” 1
The 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee’s 0
report 0
on 0
torture 0
also 0
detailed 0
the 0
central 0
role 0
she 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
particularly 1
gruesome 1
torture 1
of 0
detainee 0
Abu 0
Zubaydah. 0

Beyond 0
all 0
that, 0
she 0
played 0
a 0
vital 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
interrogation 0
videotapes 0
that 0
showed 0
the 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
both 0
at 0
the 0
black 0
site 0
she 0
ran 0
and 0
other 0
secret 0
agency 0
locations. 0

The 0
concealment 0
of 0
those 0
interrogation 0
tapes, 0
which 0
violated 0
multiple 0
court 0
orders 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
demands 0
of 0
the 0
9/11 0
commission 0
and 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
White 0
House 0
lawyers, 0
was 0
condemned 0
as 0
“obstruction” 0
by 0
commission 0
chairs 0
Lee 0
Hamilton 0
and 0
Thomas 0
Keane. 0

A 0
special 0
prosecutor 0
and 0
grand 0
jury 0
investigated 0
those 0
actions 0
but 0
ultimately 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0
prosecute. 0

The 0
name 0
of 0
that 0
CIA 0
official 0
whose 0
torture 0
activities 0
the 0

Today, 0

by 0
a 0
private 0
surveillance 0

recently 0

Fox 0

Tucker 0

has 0
once 0
again 0
ignited 0
the 0
theory 0
that 0
helicopters 0
were 0
used 0
during 0
the 0
horrific 0
attack. 0

Over 0
the 0
last 0
month 0
multiple 0
videos 0
have 0
been 0
released 0
that 0
many 0
believe 0
show 0
helicopters 0
either 0
conducting 0
an 0
attack 0
on 0
the 0
Vegas 0
Strip 0
or 0
attempting 0
to 0
stop 0
those 0
that 0
were 0
and 0
now, 0
with 0
this 0
latest 0
evidence 0
release, 0
that 0
possibility 0
seems 0
all 0
the 0
more 0
plausible. 0

As 0
Shepard 0
Ambellas 0
reported 0
for 0
Intellihub, 0
“The 0
[footage] 0
is 0
presumed 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
captured 0
by 0
a 0
nearby 0
business’s 0
southward 0

which 0
is 0
located 0
approximately 0
780 0

due 0
east 0
of 0
the 0
venue 0
where 0
the 0
Route 0
91 0
Harvest 0
Music 0

was 0
held 0
on 0
Oct. 0
1. 0

The 0
tape 0
was 0
given 0
to 0
Fox 0
News 0
by 0
an 0
attorney 0
who 0
represents 0
several 0
shooting 0
victims.” 0

Amazingly, 1
the 0
surveillance 0
camera 0
captured 0
what 0
seems 0
to 0
show 0
a 0
“large 0
amount” 0
of 0
wind 0
and 0
debris 0
being 0
kicked 0
up 0
by 0
a 0
nearby 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
above 0
the 0
attack 0
and 0
or 0
taking 0
part 0
in 0
it. 0

“Astonishingly, 0
between 0
the 0
times 0
of 0
10:13 0
and 0
10:16 0
a 0
good 0
amount 0
of 0
debris 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
being 0
pushed 0
downward 0
and 0
sideways 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
the 0
camera,” 0
Ambellas 0
continued. 0

“By 0
10:14 0
much 0
larger 0
crowds 0
of 0
people 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
streaming 0
through 0
the 0
area 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
massacre 0
going 0
on,” 0
Carlson 0
reported. 0

“You 0
can 0
see 0
a 0
large 0
amount 0
of 0
wind 0
and 0
debris, 0
apparently 0
that 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
a 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
overhead.” 0

The 0
footage 0
goes 0
how 0
to 0
show 0
two 0
men 0
attempt 0
to 0
help 0
a 0
victim 0
who 0
had 0
apparently 0
been 0
shot, 0
eventually 0
resorting 0
to 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
body 0
after 0
they 0
realized 0
it 0
was 0
simply 0
too 0
late. 0

Ambellas 0
also 0
reported 0
on 0
what 0
his 0
research 0
indicates 0
were 0
documented 0
helicopters 0
in 0
the 0
air 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

A 0
quick 0
review 0
of 0
flight 0
records 0
during 0
that 0
time 0
reveals 0
that 0
a 0
squadron 0
of 0
EC-130 0
Eurocopters 0
departed 0
from 0
Maverick 0
Leasing 0
LLC 0
at 0
10:12 0
p.m., 0
several 0
of 0
which 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
overflown 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
where 0
the 0
victim 0
and 0
debris 0
were 0
seen. 0

However, 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
the 0
choppers 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
several 0
of 0
them 0
overflew 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
debris 0
being 0
kicked 0
up 0
from 0
by 0
a 0
heavy 0
downdraft, 0
prop 0
wash, 0
possibly 0
from 0
a 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
in 0
place 0
much 0
closer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
downdraft 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
constant 0
from 0
10:13-10:16 0
p.m. 0
and 0
not 0
intermittent 0
as 0
if 0
several 0
choppers 0
had 0
just 0
passed 0
overhead. 0

As 0
I 0
have 0
reported 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
multiple 0
other 0
videos 0
taken 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
attack 0
also 0
seem 0
to 0
point 0
to 0
helicopters 0
being 0
used 0
throughout 0
the 0
city. 0

“Footage 0
has 0
emerged 0
that 0
may 0
show 0

flashes 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
helicopter 0
in 0
what 0
looks 0
to 0

It 0
is 0
also 0
important 0
to 0

in 0

that 0

any 0
more 0
indictments 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
his 0
investigation, 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
announced 0
Friday 0
evening. 0

A 0
senior 0
Justice 0
Department 0
official 0
announced 0
the 0
development 0
shortly 0
after 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
submitted 0
its 0
final 0
report 0
to 0
U.S. 0
Attorney 0
General 0
William 0
Barr. 0

Barr 0
will 0
now 0
review 0
the 0
report 0
and 0
write 0
his 0
own 0
report 0
on 0
Mueller’s 0
findings 0
and 0
present 0
them 0
to 0
Congress 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
weekend. 0

“I 0
am 0
reviewing 0
the 0
report 0
and 0
anticipate 0
that 0
I 0
may 0
be 0
in 0
a 0

advise 0
you 0
of 0
the 0
special 0

principal 0
conclusions 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
weekend,” 0
the 0
attorney 0

wrote 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
to 0
Republican 0
and 0
Democrat 0
leaders 0
on 0
the 0
House 0
and 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committees. 0

He 0
also 0
said 0
at 0
no 0
time 0
did 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
prevent 0
Mueller 0
from 0
any 0
actions 0
he 0
sought 0
to 0
make 0
during 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
his 0
investigation. 0

President 0
Trump’s 0
initial 0
reaction 0
to 0
news 0
of 0
the 0
report’s 0
delivery 0
is 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
“glad 0
it’s 0
over,” 0
reported 0
ABC 0
News. 0

In 0
a 0
separate 0
statement, 0
Trump 0
lawyers 0
Rudy 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Jay 0
Sekulow 0
said:“We’re 0
pleased 0
that 0
the 0
Office 0
of 0

Counsel 0
has 0
delivered 0
its 0
report 0
to 0
the 0

pursuant 0
to 0
the 0
regulations. 0

Attorney 0
General 0
Barr 0
will 0
determine 0
the 0

next 0
steps.” 0

Following 0
confirmation 0
of 0
the 0
report’s 0
delivery, 0
several 0
top 0
Democrat 0
lawmakers 0
demanded 0
its 0
immediate 0
public 0
release. 0

Sen. 0
Mark 0
Warner 0
(D-VA), 0
the 0
top 0
Democrat 0
on 0
the 0
Senate 0
Intelligence 0
Committee, 0
said 0
Mueller’s 0
findings 0
“must 0
be 0
provided 0
to 0
Congress 0
immediately, 0
and 0
the 0
Attorney 0
General 0
should 0
swiftly 0
prepare 0
a 0
declassified 0
version 0
for 0
the 0
public. 0

Nothing 1
short 1
of 1
that 1
will 1
suffice.” 1

Senate 0
Minority 0
Leader 0
Chuck 0
Schumer 0
(D-NY) 0
and 0
House 0
Speaker 0
Nancy 0
Pelosi 0
(D-CA) 0
echoed 0
Warner’s 0
remarks, 0
stating: 0
“It 0
is 0
imperative 0
for 0
Mr. 0
Barr 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
full 0
report 0
public 0
and 0
provide 0
its 0
underlying 0
documentation 0
and 0
findings 0
to 0
Congress.” 0

Sen. 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-IA), 0
the 0
former 0
chair 0
of 0
the 0
Senate’s 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
“that 0
we 0
still 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any 0
evidence 0
of 0
collusion.” 0

“Republicans 0
and 0
Democrats 0
have 0
roundly 0
praised 0
Mueller’s 0
reputation 0
for 0
integrity 0
and 0
thoroughness. 0

Now 0
that 0
he’s 0
wrapped 0
up 0
his 0
investigation, 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Barr 0
must 0
provide 0
Congress 0
and 0
the 1
American 1
people 1
with 0
the 0
findings 0
to 0
finally 0
put 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
the 0
speculation 0
and 0
innuendo 0
that 0
has 0
loomed 0
over 0
this 0
administration 0
since 0
its 0
earliest 0
days,” 0
Grassley 0
said. 0

“Attempts 1
to 1
keep 1
the 1
collusion 1
narrative 1
alive, 1
especially 1
for 1
political 1
reasons, 1
will 1
only 1
serve 1
to 1
further 1
harm 1
our 1
political 1
discourse 1
and 1
play 1
into 1
the 1
hands 1
of 1
our 1
foreign 1
adversaries.” 1

Obama 0
Secretly 0
Tried 0
to 0
Get 0
Banks 0
to 0
Aid 0
Iran, 0
Banks 0
Refused 0

International 0
financial 0
institutions 0
get 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
heat 0
for 0
terror 0
state 0
ties. 0

But 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
where 0
Obama 0
Inc. 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
wrong 0
thing. 0

While 0
they 0
did 0
the 0
right 0
thing. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
secretly 0
sought 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
access 0
— 0
albeit 0
briefly 0
— 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system 0
by 0
sidestepping 0
sanctions 0
kept 0
in 0
place 0
after 0
the 0
2015 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
despite 0
repeatedly 0
telling 0
Congress 0
and 0
the 0
public 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
plans 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Yet 0
another 0
Obama 0
dirty 1
deal 1
with 0
Iran 0
that 0
we're 0
just 0
learning 0
about 0
now. 0

The 0
question 0
is 0
how 1
many 1
more 1
are 1
there? 1

And 0
that's 0
part 0
of 0
why 0
Spygate 0
is 0
happening. 0

The 0
assault 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
cover-up. 0

The 0
report 0
by 0
the 0
Senate 0
Permanent 0
Subcommittee 0
on 0
Investigations 0
revealed 0
that 0
under 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama, 0
the 0
Treasury 0
Department 0
issued 0
a 0
license 0
in 0
February 0
2016, 0
never 0
previously 0
disclosed, 0
that 0
would 0
have 0
allowed 0
Iran 0
to 0
convert 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
it 0
held 0
at 0
a 0
bank 0
in 0
Oman 0
from 0
Omani 0
rials 0
into 0
euros 0
by 0
exchanging 0
them 0
first 0
into 0
U.S. 0
dollars. 0

If 0
the 0
Omani 0
bank 0
had 0
allowed 0
the 0
exchange 0
without 0
such 0
a 0
license, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
violated 0
sanctions 0
that 0
bar 0
Iran 0
from 0
transactions 0
that 0
touch 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system. 0

The 0
effort 0
was 0
unsuccessful 0
because 0
American 0
banks 0
— 0
themselves 0
afraid 0
of 0
running 0
afoul 0
of 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
— 0
declined 0
to 0
participate. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
approached 0
two 0
U.S. 0
banks 0
to 0
facilitate 0
the 0
conversion, 0
the 0
report 0
said, 0
but 0
both 0
refused, 0
citing 0
the 0
reputational 0
risk 0
of 0
doing 0
business 0
with 0
or 0
for 0
Iran. 0

That's 0
how 0
bad 1
Obama 0
was 0
on 0
Iran. 0

The 0
banking 0
system 0
was 0
more 0
reluctant 0
to 0
help 0
Iran 0
launder 0
money 0
than 0
he 0
was. 0

Nor 0
was 0
Obama 0
worried 0
about 0
the 0
reputational 0
risk 0
of 0
loading 0
foreign 0
currency 0
on 0
unmarked 0
cargo 0
planes 0
and 0
flying 0
it 0
to 0
Iran. 0

Issuing 0
the 0
license 0
was 0
not 0
illegal. 0

Still, 0
it 0
went 0
above 0
and 0
beyond 0
what 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
was 0
required 0
to 0
do 0
under 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
agreement. 0

Except 0
Obama 0
Inc. 0
weren't 0
trying 0
to 0
drive 0
a 0
hard 0
bargain. 0

So 0
they 0
didn't 0
stick 0
to 0
it. 0

They 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
aid 0
Iran. 0

Shortly 0
after 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
was 0
sealed 0
in 0
July 0
2015, 0
then-Treasury 0
Secretary 0
Jack 0
Lew 0
testified 0
that 0
even 0
with 0
the 0
sanctions 0
relief, 0
Iran 0
“will 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
denied 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
financial 0
and 0
commercial 0
market.” 0
A 0
month 0
later, 0
one 0
of 0
Lew’s 0
top 0
deputies, 0
Adam 0
Szubin, 0
testified 0
that 0
despite 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
“Iran 0
will 0
be 0
denied 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 1
important 1
market 1
and 0
unable 0
to 0
deal 0
in 0
the 0
world’s 0
most 1
important 1
currency.” 1

This 0
was 0
typical 0
of 0
the 0
worthless 1
assurances 0
that 0
Obama 0
officials 0
made. 0

And 0
disgraced 1
themselves 0
by 0
doing 0
so. 0

Obama 0
administration 0
officials 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
assured 0
concerned 0
lawmakers 0
that 0
a 0
general 0
license 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
coming. 0

But 0
the 0
report 0
from 0
the 0
Republican 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
panel 0
showed 0
that 0
a 0
draft 0
of 0
the 0
license 0
was 0
indeed 0
prepared, 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
never 0
published. 0

And 0
when 0
questioned 0
by 0
lawmakers 0
about 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
granting 0
Iran 0
any 0
kind 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system, 0
Obama-era 0
officials 0
never 0
volunteered 0
that 0
the 0
specific 0
license 0
for 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
in 0
Oman 0
had 0
been 0
issued 0
two 0
months 0
earlier. 0

Scandal-free 1
administration, 0
folks. 0

Not 0
a 0
single 0
scandal 1
to 0
see 0
here. 0

Not 1
a 1
one. 1

The 0
Remnant 0
Newspaper 0

The 0
unmasking 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
exposed 0
the 0
pervasive 1
prelate 1
coverup 1
of 0
homosexual 0
sexual 0
predation 0
in 0
the 0
American 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

These 0
swarmy 1
power 1
brokers 1
have 0
colluded 0
far 0
too 0
long 0
at 0
the 0
tragic 1
expense 0
of 0
innocent 0
boys 0
and 0
seminarians. 0

For 0
60 0
years, 0
Ted 0
McCarrick 0
roamed 0
the 0
halls 0
of 0
seminaries, 0
harassing, 0
raping, 0
and 0
assaulting 0
young 0
males 0
around 0
the 0
world. 0

His 0
brother 0
bishops 0
all 0
knew 0
and 0
they 0
all 0
stayed 0
silent. 0

How 0
fortuitous 0
and 0
revelatory 0
that 0
McCarrick, 0
the 0
Molester 1
would 0
divulge 0
his 0
personal 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
pre-Conclave 0
lobbying 0
effort 0
to 0
elect 0
Jorge 0
Bergoglio 0
as 0
Pope. 0

The 0
notorious 0
lavender 1
mafia 1
anxiously 0
sought 0
a 0
simpatico 0
Pope 0
to 0
advance 0
its 0
reformist 0
homosexual 0
agenda. 0

Bergoglio 0
was 0
their 0
man. 0

The 0
now 0
well 0
known 0
McCarrick 0
Villanova 0
Speech 0
on 0
October 0
13, 0
2013 0
where 0
he 0
relayed 0
the 0
story 0
about 0
a 0
prominent 0
Italian 0
man 0
who 0
met 0
with 0
McCarrick 0
to 0
ask 0
him 0
to 0
lobby 0
for 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
to 0
the 0
papacy. 0

In 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal, 0
the 0
conversation 0
takes 0
on 0
new 0
meaning... 0

McCarrick 0
described 0
the 0
conversation 0
with 0
the 0
Influential 1
Roman: 0

“Before 0
we 0
went 0
into 0
the 0
General 0
Congregation, 0
a 0
very 0
interesting 0
and 0
influential 1
Italian 0
gentleman 0
came 0
to 0
see 0
me 0
at 0
the 0
Seminary 0
(where 0
else?) 0

where 0
I 0
was 0
staying. 0

We 0
sat 0
down 0
and 0
he’s 0
a 0
very 0
brilliant 0
man, 0
very 0
influential 1
in 0
Rome 0
and 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
favor 0
to 0
ask 0
of 0
me 0
back 0
home 0
in 0
the 0
U.S., 0
but 0
then 0
he 0
said:” 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
What 0
about 0
Bergoglio? 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
I 0
was 0
surprised 0
and 0
said, 0
What 0
about 0
Bergoglio? 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
Does 0
he 0
have 0
a 0
chance? 0

Molester 1
McCarrick: 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
so. 0

No 0
one 0
has 0
mentioned 0
his 0
name. 0

He 0
isn’t 0
on 0
anyone’s 0
mind. 0

Influential 1
Roman: 0
He 0
could 0
do 0
it 0
you 0

What 0

do? 0

He 0

If 0

5 0

he 0

If 0

And 0
talk 0
him 0
up, 0
McCarrick 0
the 0
Molester 1
did! 0

Oh, 0
the 0
irony! 0

That 0
the 1
most 1
prolific 1
serial 1
predator 1
Cardinal 0
would 0
divulge 0
the 0
pre-Conclave 0
Bergoglio 0
plot 0
to 0
“reform 1
the 1
Church.” 1
Now 0
we 0
know 0
what 0
“reform 1
the 1
Church” 1
looks 0
like 0
in 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
papacy. 0

Yes, 0
the 0
clever 0
and 0
tyrannical 1
Bergoglio, 0
through 0
his 0
manipulation 0
of 0
synods, 0
footnotes, 0
exhortations, 0
personal 0
phone 0
calls, 0
airplane 0
pressers, 0
and 0
correspondence 0
has 0
nearly 0
completed 0
his 0
task 0
of 0
modernizing 0
the 0
Roman 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
5 0
years. 0

The 0
rallying 0
cry 0
for 0
his 0
homosexual 0
modern 0
agenda 0
was 0
sounded 0
in 0
his 0
July 0
29, 0
2013 0
airplane 0
presser. 0

Who 0
am 0
I 0
to 0
judge 0
set 0
the 0
tone 0
for 0
merciful 0
embrace 0
of 0
homosexual 0
priests. 0

After 0
5 0
long 0
years, 0
his 0
unrelenting 0
mercy 0
mantra 0
seemingly 0
extends 0
only 0
to 0
homosexual 0
clerics, 0
not 0
to 0
the 0
laity 0
or 0
clergy 0
victims 0
who 0
protest 0
the 0
cover 0
ups 0
by 0
prelates. 0

Francis’ 0
wink 0
and 0
nod 0
to 0
the 0
homosexual 0
lifestyle 0
landed 0
him 0
on 0
the 0
cover 0
of 0
the 0
Advocate, 0
the 0
gay 0
magazine, 0
as 0
its 0
Man 0
of 0
the 0
Year. 0

He 0
lapped 0
up 0
the 0
accolades 0
from 0
the 0
secular 0
culture 0
and 0
main 0
stream 0
media. 0

Yet, 0
fame 0
is 0
and 0
predation 1
is 1
unrelenting, 1
even 0
for 0
Popes. 0

In 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
Queen 0
Elizabeth, 0
this 0
year 0
has 0
been 0
annus 0
horribilis 0
for 0
Francis. 0

Excuse 0
the 0
gay 0
slang 0
pun 0
but, 0
the 0
chickens 0
have 0
come 0
home 0
to 0
roost. 0

The 0
cascading 0
revelations 0
of 0
papal 0
sex 0
scandals 0
are 0
toppling 0
the 0
barque 0
of 0
Peter. 0

Will 0
Catholic 0
laity 0
pay 0
attention 0
and 0
take 0
action? 0

The 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
created 0
an 0
earthquake 1
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
with 0
aftershocks 0
that 0
will 0
last 0
for 0
years. 0

The 0
timing 0
is 0
eerily 1
propitious 0
and 0
providential 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
5 0
year 0
deadline. 0

Will 0
the 0
laity 0
step 0
up 0
and 0
reclaim 0
our 0
hijacked 1
Catholic 0
Church? 0

This 0
critical 0
time 0
in 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
demands 0
that 0
the 0
laity 0
step 0
forward 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
Church, 0
its 0
children 0
and 0
seminarians 0
from 0
predators. 0

We 0
must 0
close 0
ranks 0
before 0
another 0
precious 0
child 0
is 0
exploited, 0
a 0
holy 0
seminarian 0
is 0
violated, 0
or 0
another 0
homosexual 0
orgy 1
is 0
covered 0
up 0
at 0
the 0
Vatican. 0

The 0
first 0
order 0
of 0
business 0
is 0
to 0
scuttle 0
the 0
upcoming 0
October 0
Synod 0
on 0
Young 0
People, 0
the 0
Faith, 0
and 0
Vocational 0
Discernment. 0

Remember 0
that 0
influential 1
Roman 0
gentleman 0
friend 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
who 0
said 0
that 0
Bergoglio 0
could 0
reform 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
5 0
years? 0

Bergoglio’s 0
upcoming 0
Synod 0
on 0
Young 0
People 0
will 0
serve 0
as 0
the 0
culminating 0
vehicle 0
for 0
the 0
5 0
year 0
modernist 0
reform 0
of 0
the 0
St. 1
Gallen 1
Mafia. 1

This 0
Synod 0
is 0
designed 0
to 0
exploit 0
the 0
youth, 0
like 0
they’ve 0
been 0
doing 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
60 0
years. 0

If 0
it 0
weren’t 0
so 0
infuriating, 1
it 0
would 0
be 0
laughable 0
that 0
following 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
scandal 0
of 0
sexual 0
predation 0
of 0
young 0
males 0
and 0
seminarians, 0
by 0
a 0
Cardinal, 0
and 0
covered 0
up 0
by 0
Bishops, 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
would 0
host 0
a 0
Synod 0
of 0
Bishops 0
on 0
the 0
topic 0
of 0
young 0
people 0
and 0
vocations! 0

Furthermore, 0
this 0
nightmare 0
of 0
a 0
“sinod" 0
is 0
inviting 0
youth 0
from 0
ages 0
16-29 0
to 0
mingle 0
with 0
the 0
Bishops 0
to 0
discuss 0
the 0
Church, 0
faith 0
and 0
vocations. 0

Are 1
you 1
thoroughly 1
disgusted 1
by 1
this 1
farce? 1

The 0
Bishops 0
have 0
proven 0
that 0
they 0
cannot 0
be 0
trusted 0
to 0
protect 0
young 0
people 0
and 0
seminarians 0
from 0
predators. 0

The 0
ever 0
growing 0
global 0
list 0
of 0
Bishops 0
and 0
Cardinals 0
that 0
have 0
preyed 0
on 0
/and 0
or 0
covered 0
up 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
and 0
seminarians 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
60 0
years 0
continues 0
to 0
enrage 0
the 0
laity. 0

We 0
are 0
no 0
longer 0
Shocked, 0
just 0
fed 0
up. 0

Let’s 0
start 0
with 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
who 0
will 0
lead 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Synod, 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Dicastery 0
for 0
Laity, 0
Family 0
and 0
Life. 0

As 0
the 0
DC 0
roommate 0
and 0
protege 0
of 0
Ted 0
McCarrick, 0
Farrell 0
so 0
respected 0
McCarrick, 0
the 0
Molester, 1
that 0
he 0
fashioned 0
his 0
Coat 0
of 0
Arms 0
as 0
a 0
tribute 0
to 0
Uncle 0
Ted. 0

Farrell’s 0
pathetic 1
and 1
laughable 1
defense 0
“I 0
never 0
knew 0
anything 0
about 0
McCarrick” 0
video 0
highlights 0
the 0
continuing 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
denial 0
by 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Catholic 0
hierarchy. 0

Undoubtedly, 0
Farrell 0
as 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
this 0
Synod 0
chose 0
his 0
dear 0
friend 0
gay 0
friendly, 0
Fr. 0

James 0
Martin, 0
S.J. 0

to 0
keynote 0
the 0
Synod. 0

Farrell’s 0
graciously 0
offers 0
notorious 0
praise 0
for 0
Martin’s 0
new 0
book, 0
Building 0
a 0
Bridge 0
(to 1
hell, 1
ed.) 0

exposes 0
his 0
obvious 0
underlying 0
homosexual 0
agenda 0
and 0
aura 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Synod: 0

“A 0
welcome 0
and 0
much-needed 0
book 0
that 0
will 0
help 0
bishops, 0
priests, 0
pastoral 0
associates, 0
and 0
all 0
church 0
leaders 0
more 0
compassionately 0
minister 0
to 0
the 0
LGBT 0
community. 0

It 0
will 0
also 0
help 0
LGBT 0
Catholics 0
feel 0
more 0
at 0
home 0
in 0
what 0
is, 0
after 0
all, 0
their 0
church.” 0

What 0
merciful 0
praise 0
for 0
Martin’s 0
book, 0
Cardinal 0
Farrell! 0

Contrary 0
to 0
the 0
theme 0
of 0
mercy 0
and 0
compassion 0
to 0
LGBTs, 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
your 0
mentor, 0
McCarrick 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
groom 0
and 0
grow 0
an 0
LGBT 0
community. 0

Clearly, 0
you 0
and 0
Fr. 0

Martin 0
have 0
much 0
in 0
common 0
since 0
you 0
both 0
claimed 0
you 0
were 0
“shocked” 0
by 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
allegations. 0

Explain 0
to 0
Catholics 0
why 0
would 0
you 0
headline 0
a 0
homosexual 0
affirming 0
speaker 0
at 0
a 0
Synod 0
for 0
youth 0
and 0
seminarians? 0

In 0
case 0
you 0
haven’t 0
been 0
reading 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
headlines 0
or 0
noticing 0
the 0
plunging 0
mass 0
attendance 0
and 0
collections, 0
Catholics 0
don’t 0
trust 0
their 0
boys 0
around 0
priests 0
and 0
are 0
furious 0
that 0
their 0
seminarians 0
are 0
subjected 0
to 0
unrelenting 0
homosexual 0
sexual 0
harassment. 0

McCarrick 0
is 0
the 0
last 0
straw. 0

All 1
credibility 1
is 1
lost. 1

The 0
October 0
Synod 0
is 0
yet 0
another 0
example 0
of 0
Church 0
leaders 0
exploiting 0
Catholic 0
youth 0
for 0
their 0
own 0
personal 0
power 0
agenda 0
and 0
selfish 0
motives. 0

Bergoglio’s 0
five 0
year 0
plan 0
is 0
nearly 0
complete. 0

Catholics 0
must 0
shed 0
their 0
trust 0
and 0
naivety 0
in 0
the 0

town 0
hall 0
meeting 0
this 0
week, 0
citizens 0
showed 0
that 0
they 0
still 0
have 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
questions 0
for 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
in 0
regards 0
to 0
the 0
cold-blooded 1
killing 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean. 0

On 0
top 0
of 0
questions 0
as 0
to 0
why 0
it 0
took 0
several 0
days 0
to 0
arrest 0
the 0
cop 0
— 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Guyger 0
admitted 0
to 0
it 0
— 0
were 0
questions 0
like 0
why 0
this 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
threat 1
to 1
society 1
has 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
police 0
force. 0

During 0
the 0
meeting, 0
as 0
Chief 0
Renee 0
Hall 0
dodged 0
several 0
questions 0
over 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
the 0
arrest, 0
she 0
did 0
go 0
out 0
of 0
her 0
way 0
to 0
answer 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
why 0
Guyger 0
is 0
still 0
collecting 0
a 0
paycheck 0
from 0
their 0
department. 0

The 0
short 0
of 0
it, 0
according 0
to 0
Hall, 0
is 0
she 0
can’t 0
fire 0
her. 0

“I 0
can’t 0
do 0
that 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
both 0
local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
that 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action. 0

There 0
are 0
civil 0
service 0
laws 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
adhere 0
to,” 0
said 0
Hall. 0

But 0
experts 0
say 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
reports, 0
Justin 0
Moore, 0
a 0
civil 0
rights 0
attorney 0
was 0
a 0
panelist 0
at 0
the 0
meeting 0
and 0
was 0
surprised 0
by 0
the 0
Chief’s 0
comments. 0

“I 0
was 0
completely 0
mystified, 0
and 0
I 0
really 0
didn’t 0
understand 0
where 0
it 0
came 0
from 0
last 0
night. 0

It 0
seemed 0
like 0
Chief 1
Hall 1
might 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
well 1
informed 1
on 1
the 1
law,” 1
said 0
Moore. 0

WFAA 0
went 0
further 0
and 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
“the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
general 0
orders 0
do 0
allow 0
the 0
chief 0
to 0
take 0
action, 0
saying, 0
‘The 0
Chief 0
of 0
Police 0
may 0
circumvent 0
all 0
formal 0
disciplinary 0
procedures 0
to 0
render 0
an 0
immediate 0
decision 0
when 0
it 0
deems 0
it 0
necessary 0
to 0
preserve 0
the 0
integrity 0
of 0
the 0
department.’” 0

Apparently, 0
this 0
“integrity” 0
is 0
not 0
worth 0
preserving 0
and 0
the 0
Dallas 0
police 0
are 0
going 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
way 0
to 0
keep 0
a 0
killer 1
cop 1
on 0
their 0
payroll. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
pointed 0
out, 0
lots 0
of 0
cops 0
across 0
the 0
state 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
under 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
have 0
been 0
fired 0
by 0
police 0
chiefs. 0

This 0
includes 0
cops 0
within 0
the 0
Dallas 0
police 0
department. 0

Amy 0
Wilburn, 0
a 0
former 0
Dallas 1
cop 1
shot 1
an 1
unarmed 1
teen 1
in 0
the 0
stomach 0
as 0
he 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
his 0
hands 0
in 0
the 0
air 0
in 0
2013. 0

Days 0
later, 0
after 0
her 0
account 0
was 0
found 0
to 0
be 0
entirely 0
false, 0
she 0
was 0
fired 0
for 0
it. 0

Wilburn 0
became 0
the 0
first 0
cop 0
in 0
41 0
years 0
— 0
since 0
officer 1
Darrell 1
Cain 1
murdered 1
a 1
12-year-old 1
boy 1
in 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
his 0
squad 0
car 0
— 0
to 0
be 0
indicted 0
for 0
shooting 0
a 0
suspect. 0

Also 0
in 0
2013, 0
officer 1
Cardan 1
Spencer 1
shot 1
a 1
mentally 1
ill 1
man 1
in 0
his 0
driveway. 0

Days 0
later, 0
he 0
was 0
also 0
fired 0
after 0
surveillance 0
video 0
proved 0
he 0
was 0
lying 0
about 0
what 0
happened. 0

So 0
why 0
hasn’t 0
the 0
chief 0
fired 0
Gugyer, 0
who 0
has 0
actually 0
been 0
charged, 0
arrested, 0
and 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man? 0

Like 0
all 0
those 0
accused 0
of 0
a 0
crime, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
deserves 0
her 0
day 0
in 0
court. 0

However, 0
as 0
far 0
as 0
her 0
job 0
with 0
the 0
department 0
is 0
concerned, 0
she 0
has 0
already 0
proven 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
fit 0
for 0
duty, 0
ever 0
again. 0

WFAA 0
asked 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
Department 0
for 0
the 0
laws 0
she 0
cited 0
claiming 0
that 0
she 0
can’t 0
fire 0
Guyger, 0
but 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
provide 0
them. 0

The 0
department 0
did 0
respond 0
about 0
the 0
general 0
order 0
mentioned 0
by 0
WFAA, 0
however, 0
saying, 0
“General 0
order 0
508 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
Police 0
Chief’s 0
ability 0
to 0
circumvent 0
the 0
formal 0
disciplinary 0
procedures 0
not 0
the 0
investigative 0
process.” 0

Exactly 0
what 0
“investigative 0
process” 0
needs 0
to 0
happen 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
fire 0
her 0
remains 0
unclear 0
as 0
this 0
public 0
servant 0
admitted 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
innocent 1
man 0
in 0
his 0
own 0
home. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
she 0
should 0
be 0
fired 0
for 0
this. 0

But 0
then 0
again, 0
as 0
we’ve 0
reported 0
already 0
this 0
week, 0
Amber 0
Guyger 0
is 0
subject 0
to 0
a 0
different 0
set 0
of 0
rules 0
than 0
common 0
citizens, 0
which 0
apparently 0
includes 0
keeping 0
a 0
paycheck 0
after 0
admitting 0
to 0
killing 0
an 0
unarmed, 0
innocent, 1
pillar 1
of 1
society, 1
Botham 0
Jean. 0

serious 0

in 0
the 0
Muslim 0
world. 0

outside 0

the 0
69-year-old 0
Jewish 0
man 0
(wearing 0
a 0
kippah 0
on 0

of 0
North 0

who 0
hit 0

Long 1

" 0

It 0
can't 0
be 0
a 0
case 0
of 0
Muslim 0
Judeophobia. 0

(That 0
would 0
be 0
Islamophobic.) 0

And 0
since 0
we're 0
in 0
Europe, 0
it's 0
time 0
to 0
default 0
to 0
the 0
standard 0
excuse, 0
mental 0
illness, 0
current 0
flavor, 0
over-excitement. 0

The 0
police 0
quickly 0
intervened 0
to 0
save 0
the 0
victim 0
who 0
lodged 0
a 0
complaint. 0

The 0
anti-Semitic 0
attacker 0
was 0
arrested 0
and 0
placed 0
in 0
police 0
custody 0
and 0
then 0
transferred 0
to 0
the 0
psychiatric 0
infirmary, 0
on 0
the 0
recommendation 0
of 0
the 0
doctor 0
because 0
of 0
his 0
observed 0
state 0
of 0
excitement. 0

It's 0
okay. 0

Getting 0
really 1
excited 1
about 0
Jews 0
is 0
a 0
common 0
problem 0
among 0
Muslim 0
settlers 0
in 0
France. 0

Earlier 0
this 0
month, 0
the 0
suspect 0
in 0
the 0
alleged 0
murder 0
of 0
a 0
Jewish 0
physician 0
in 0
Paris 0
was 0
deemed 0
not 0
responsible 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
in 0
a 0
second 0
psychiatric 0
evaluation 0
ordered 0
by 0
a 0
judge 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
defense 0
did 0
not 0
request 0
it. 0

The 0
suspect, 0
Traore 0
Kobili, 0
is 0
scheduled 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
third 0
evaluation 0
to 0
determine 0
his 0
ability 0
to 0
stand 0
trial 0
for 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
Sarah 0
Halimi 0
in 0
April 0
2017. 0

He 0
is 0
alleged 0
to 0
have 0
beaten 1
her 1
to 1
death 1
while 0
calling 0
her 0
a 0
demon 1
and 0
shouting 0
about 0
Allah 0
before 0
throwing 0
her 0
body 0
from 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
her 0
third-story 0
apartment. 0

They're 1
all 1
crazy 1
in 1
Europe. 1

A 0
Muslim 0
terrorist 0
stabbed 0
four 0
people 0
at 0
a 0
train 0
station 0
near 0
Munich 0
while 0
screaming, 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar”. 1

In 0
between 0
proclaiming 0
the 0
glory 0
of 0
Allah, 0
he 0
also 0
shouted 0
that 0
his 0
victims 0
were 0
all 0
“unbelievers”. 1

A 0
woman 0
heard 0
him 0
say, 0
“Infidel, 1
you 1
must 1
die”. 1

The 0
German 0
authorities 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
inescapable 0
conclusion 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
had 0
nothing 0

was 0
probably 0
not 0
even 0

Gyulchekhra 0

Faced 0
with 0

the 0

blamed 0
mental 1

And 0

Malek, 0
a 0

stabbed 0
three 0

in 0
The 0
Hague 0
while 0
shouting, 0
“Allahu 1

for 0
their 0

by 0

out 0

into 0

On 0
the 0

Malek 0
cut 0

throat. 0

He 0
also 0
stabbed 0
two 0

In 0
December 0

a 0
Syrian 0
refugee 0
wearing 0
a 0
keffiyah 0
and 0
waving 0
a 0
terrorist 0
PLO 0
flag, 0
went 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
Jewish 0
restaurant 0
in 0
Amsterdam, 0
shouted 0
“Allahu 1
Akbar” 1
and 0
began 0
smashing 0
the 0
windows. 0

The 0
police 0
stood 0
by 0
and 0
watched 0
until 0
he 0
was 0
done. 0

And 0
then 0
they 0
arrested 0
him. 0

Ali 0
admitted 0
to 0
having 0
fought 0
with 0
Jihadists 0
in 0
Syria. 0

So 0
the 0
system 0
decided 0
that 0
he 0
needed 0
a 0
psychiatric 0
evaluation 0

Maybe 0
it's 0
not 0
the 0
terrorists 0
who 0
are 0
nuts. 1

Maybe 1
it's 1
the 1
authorities 1
who 1
are 1

declined 0
Wednesday 0
to 0
comment 0
about 0
Haig 0
or 0
the 0
investigation. 0

A 0
law 0
enforcement 0
official 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press 0
in 0
October 0
that 0
Paddock 0
bought 0
1,000 0
rounds 0
of 0

from 0
a 0

seller 0

three 0
weeks 0
before 0

whether 0

Haig 0
told 0
the 0
AP 0
on 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
sold 0
unspecified 0
ammunition 0
to 0
Paddock. 0

He 0
also 0
told 0
"CBS 0
This 0
Morning" 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
he 0
sold 0
more 0
than 0
700 0

to 0
Paddock. 0

"I 0
couldn't 0
detect 0
anything 0
wrong 0
with 0
this 0
guy," 0
he 0
said 0
of 0
Paddock. 0

The 0
ammunition 0
sale 0
took 0
place 0
at 0
Haig's 0
home 0
in 0
Mesa, 0
because 0
he 0
didn't 0
have 0
all 0
the 0
ammunition 0
on 0
hand 0
that 0
Paddock 0
wanted 0
while 0
at 0
the 0
gun 0
show. 0

Victor 0
said 0
a 0
box 0
that 0
Paddock 0
used 0
to 0
carry 0
ammunition 0
out 0
of 0
Haig's 0
house 0

bore 0

later 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
hotel 0
where 0
the 0
attack 0
was 0
launched. 0

It's 0
unknown 0
whether 0
the 0
ammunition 0
Haig 0
sold 0
to 0
Paddock 0
was 0
used 0
in 0
the 0
attack. 0

The 0
lawyer 0
said 0
the 0
type 0
and 0
quantity 0
of 0
ammunition 0
Paddock 0
bought 0
from 0
his 0
client 0
wasn't 0
unusual. 0

are 0
no 0
restrictions 0
on 0
the 0

a 0

a 0

Warren 0
said 0
that 0
AAA 0
made 0
the 0
right 0
decision 0
to 0
remove 0
Patel 0
from 0
the 0
stage 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
his 0
jokes, 0
which 0
contradicted 0
the 0
sensitive 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
event 0
itself. 0

“The 1
message 1
they 1
were 1
trying 1
to 1
send 1
with 1
the 1
event 1
was 1
opposite 1
to 1
the 1
jokes 1
he 1
was 1
making, 1
and 1
using 1
people’s 1
ethnicity 1
as 1
the 1
crux 1
of 1
his 1
jokes 1
could 1
be 1
funny 1
but 1
still 1
offensive...He 1
definitely 1
wasn’t 1
the 1
most 1
crass 1
comedian 1
I’ve 1
ever 1
heard 1
but 1
for 1
the 1
event 1
it 1
was 1
inappropriate,” 1
Warren 0
said. 0

However, 0
audience 0
member 0
Elle 0
Ferguson, 0

‘22, 0
said 0
that 0
while 0
comedians 0
can 0
push 0
the 0
boundaries 0
of 0

she 0
had 0
heard 0
similar 0

did 0
not 0
find 0
them 0
offensive. 0

“While 0
what 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
that 0
he 0
said 0
might 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
bit 0
provoking 0
to 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
audience, 0
as 0
someone 0
who 0
watches 0

a 0

none 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
jokes 0
that 0
I 0
hadn’t 0
heard 0
before 0

none 0
of 0
them 0
were 0
jokes 0
that 0
elicited 0
such 0
a 0

in 0
my 0
experience,” 0
Ferguson 0
said. 0

“[AAA] 0
should 0
have 0
talked 0

because 0

the 0

not 0
in 0
the 0

with 0
Patel’s 0
closing 0
remarks. 0

“I 0
really 0
dislike 0
when 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
older 0
say 0
that 0
our 0

to 0
be 0
exposed 0

Obviously 0
the 0
world 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
safe 0
space 0
but 0
just 0
accepting 0
that 0
it’s 0
not 0
and 0
continuing 0
to 0
perpetuate 0
the 0

of 0
it… 0
is 0
saying 0
that 0
it 0

said 0
Jao. 0

“When 0
older 0
generations 0
say 0
you 0
need 0
to 0
stop 0

it’s 0

Apology 0

Former 0
president 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
has 0
spoken 0
out 0
about 0
what 0
happened 0
during 0
his 0
affair 0
with 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
intern 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky. 0

Among 0
other 0
things, 0
Clinton 0
says 0
Lewinsky 0
is 0
not 0
owed 0
an 0
apology 0
from 0
him 0
and 0
he 0
“did 0
the 0
right 0
thing.” 0

As 0
reported 0
by 0
CNN, 0
Speaking 0
to 0
Today, 0
Clinton 0
defended 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
office 0
following 0
the 0
scandal. 0

“A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
have 0
been 0
conveniently 0
omitted 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
story 0
work, 0
I 0
think 0
partly 0
because 0
they’re 0
frustrated 0
that 0
they 0
got 0
all 0
these 0
serious 0
allegations 0
against 0
the 0
current 0
occupant 0
of 0
the 0
Oval 0
Office 0
and 0
his 0
voters 0
don’t 0
seem 0
to 0
care,” 0
Clinton 0
said, 0
pointing 0
to 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
sexual 1
misconduct 1
allegations 0
against 0
current 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
who 0
has 0
denied 0
them. 0

“I 0
think 0
I 0
did 0
the 0
right 0
thing. 0

I 0
defended 0
the 0
Constitution.” 0

In 0
an 0
essay 0
for 0
Vanity 0
Fair 0
published 0
earlier 0
this 0
year, 0
Lewinsky 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
questioning 0
the 0
narrative 0
surrounding 0
the 0
affair, 0
which 0
played 0
a 0
central 0
role 0
in 0
Clinton’s 0
eventual 0
impeachment. 0

“Now, 0
at 0
44, 0
I’m 0
beginning 0
(just 0
beginning) 0
to 0
consider 0
the 0
implications 0
of 0
power 0
differentials 0
that 0
were 0
so 0
vast 0
between 0
a 0
president 0
and 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
intern,” 0
she 0
wrote. 0

“I’m 0
beginning 0
to 0
entertain 0
the 0
notion 0
that 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
circumstance 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
consent 0
might 0
well 0
be 0
rendered 0
moot.” 0

When 0
asked 0
if 0
he 0
owed 0
Lewinsky 0
an 0
apology, 0
President 0
Clinton 0
told 0
NBC‘s 0
Craig 0
Melvin, 0
“No, 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
— 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
talked 0
to 0
her. 0

But 0
I 0
did 0
say 0
publicly 0
on 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
occasion 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
sorry. 0

That’s 0
very 0
different. 0

The 0
apology 0
was 0
public.” 0
Although 0
some 0
may 0
not 0
have 0
taken 0
what 0
Clinton 0
said 0
as 0
an 0
apology, 0
he 0
did 0
publicly 0
acknowledge 0
at 0
the 0
National 0
Prayer 0
Breakfast 0
in 0
1998 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
“sinned.” 0

“I 0
don’t 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
fancy 0
way 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
sinned. 0

It 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
everybody 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
hurt 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
sorrow 0
I 0
feel 0
is 0
genuine 0
— 0
first 0
and 0
most 0
important, 0
my 0
family, 0
also 0
my 0
friends, 0
my 0
staff, 0
my 0
Cabinet, 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky 0
and 0
her 0
family, 0
and 0
the 1
American 1
people.” 1

Only 0
the 0

who 0
claims 0

tried 0
to 0
rape 0
her 0
decades 0
ago 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
student. 0

The 0
third 0
accuser 0
is 0
Julie 0
Swetnick, 0
a 0
55-year-old 0
certified 0
systems 0
engineer, 0
who 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
claimed 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
others 0
spiked 0
the 0
drinks 0
of 0
young 0
women 0
at 0
high 0
school 0
parties 0
with 0
intoxicants 0
to 0
clear 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
be 0
gang-raped. 0

Incredibly, 0
Swetnick 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
sworn 0
statement 0
that 0
she 0
witnessed 0
gang 0
rapes 0
at 0
these 0
parties 0
but 0
kept 0
on 0
attending 0
them 0
anyway. 0

It 0
gets 0
weirder. 0

Kavanaugh 0
was 0
a 1
“mean 1
drunk,” 1
she 0
stated. 0

He 0
drank 0
excessively 0
at 0
these 0
parties 0
and 0
would 0
grind 0
against 0
girls 0
and 0
try 0
to 0
take 0
their 0
clothing 0
of, 0
she 0
said. 0

Swetnick 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
gang-raped 1
at 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
parties 0
in 0
1982 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
consuming 0
a 0
spiked 0
drink 0
that 0
contained 0
“Quaaludes 0
or 0
something 0
similar.” 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
his 0
friend 0
Mark 0
Judge 0
were 0
present 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
at 0
which 0
she 0
was 0
raped, 0
she 0
states, 0
but 0
she 0
doesn’t 0
accuse 0
them 0
of 0
participating 0
in 0
it. 0

In 0
response, 0
Kavanaugh 0
labeled 0
Swetnick's 0
salacious 0
allegations 0
"ridiculous 1
and 1
from 1
the 1
Twilight 1
Zone." 1

"I 0
don't 0
know 0
who 0
this 0
is 0
and 0
this 0
never 0
happened," 0
the 0
judicial 0
nominee 0
added. 0

of 0

in 0

Swetnick 0
says 0
in 0
her 0
affidavit 0
that 0
she 0
saw 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
1980s 0
"drink 0
excessively 0
at 0
many" 0
house 0
parties 0
in 0
suburban 0
Maryland. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
Judge 0
were 0
students 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Prep, 0
a 0
private 0
Catholic 0
all-boys 0
school. 0

She 0
said 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
Judge 0
engaged 0
in 0
"abusive 0
and 0
physically 0
aggressive 0
behavior 0
toward 0
girls," 0
which 0
"included 0
the 0
fondling 0
and 0
groping 0
of 0
girls 0
without 0
their 0
consent" 0
and 0
"not 0
taking 0
'No' 0
for 0
an 0
answer." 0

Predictably, 0
all 0
10 0
Democrat 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
urged 0
President 0
Trump 0
to 0
either 0
"immediately 0
withdraw 0
the 0
nomination 0
or 0
order 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
into 0
all 0
the 0
allegations." 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
indication 0
so 0
far 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
will 0
oblige 0
them. 0

no 0
one’s 0
surprise, 0
Trump’s 1
legal 1
tormentor, 1
Stormy 0
Daniels 0
attorney 0
Michael 0
Avenatti, 0
whom 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
has 0
dubbed 0
“creepy 1
porn 1
lawyer,” 1
is 0
representing 0
Swetnick. 0

"There 0
should 0
be 0
an 0
immediate 0
investigation" 0
of 0
Swetnick’s 0
dramatic 0
allegations, 0
Avenatti 0
said 0
on 0
MSNBC, 0
"and 0
there 0
should 0
be 0
no 0
rush 0
to 0
confirm 0

The 0

slammed 1
Avenatti. 0

“Avenatti 1

who 1
is 1

“He 1

He 0
rejected 0
Swetnick’s 0
allegations 0
as 0
“another 1

described 0

The 0
transcript 0
of 0
Kavanaugh's 0
Tuesday 0
interview 0
also 0
cited 0
another 0
anonymous 0
claim 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
involving 0
Kavanaugh, 0
dating 0
back 0
to 0
1985 0
and 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
office 0
of 0
Sen. 0
Sheldon 0
Whitehouse 0
(D-R.I.), 0
which 0
the 0
judge 0
also 0
flatly 0
denied 0
to 0
investigators. 0

And 0
GOP 0
investigators 0
said 0
late 0
Wednesday 0
they 0
received 0
an 0
additional 0
anonymous 0
claim 0
of 0
rape 0
passed 0
along 0
by 0
Sen. 0
Kamala 0
Harris 0
(D-Calif.). 0

Accuser 0
number 0
two 0
is 0
Deborah 0
Ramirez, 0
53, 0
who 0
went 0
public 0
with 0
her 0
claims 0
in 0
a 0
New 0
Yorker 0
magazine 0
article 0
Sunday. 0

Ramirez 0
alleges 0
she 0
was 0
assaulted 0
by 0
Kavanaugh 0
at 0
a 0
drunken 0
party 0
decades 0
ago 0
at 0
Yale 0
College. 0

She 0
claims 0
Kavanaugh 0
exposed 0
himself 0
to 0
her 0
and 0
brushed 0
his 0
genitals 0
against 0
her. 0

If 0
Kavanaugh 0
isn’t 0
on 0
the 0
bench 0
Monday, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
will 0
be 0
shorthanded 0
as 0
it 0
begins 0
hearing 0
cases 0
in 0
its 0
new 0
term. 0

It 0
normally 0
has 0
a 0
complement 0
of 0
nine 0
justices 0
but 0
with 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy’s 0
retirement 0
July 0
31, 0
which 0
cleared 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
only 0
eight 0
justices. 0

Roughly 0
speaking 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
4-to-4 0
liberal 0
to 0
conservative 0
ideological 0
split 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

Democrats 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
into 0
the 0
next 0
Congress 0
where 0
they 0
may 0
seize 0
control 0
from 0
Republicans. 0

Election 0
Day 0
is 0
November 0
6. 0

The 0
GOP 0
currently 0
controls 0
the 0
Senate, 0
which 0
has 0
the 0
final 0
say 0
on 0
judicial 0
nominations, 0
by 0
an 0
uncomfortably 0
close 0
margin 0
of 0
51 0
to 0
49. 0

The 0
proceedings 0
Thursday 0
are 0
supposed 0
to 0
get 0
underway 0
at 0
10:00 0
a.m. 0
Eastern 0
time. 0

Committee 0
Republicans 0
considered 0
the 0
political 0
optics 0
and 0
didn’t 0
relish 0
the 0
prospect 0
of 0
their 0
all-male 1
team 1
of 0
11 0
senators 0
questioning 0
a 0
woman 0
so 0
they 0
hired 0
sex-crimes 0
prosecutor 0
Rachel 0
Mitchell 0
of 0
Maricopa 0
County, 0
Arizona, 0
to 0
ask 0
the 0
questions 0
at 0
what 0
promises 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
highly-watched 0
hearing. 0

Democrats 0
predictably 0
freaked 1
out 1
at 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
woman 0
lead 0
the 0
questioning 0
since 0
their 0
primary 0
objective 0
here 0
is 0
to 0
embarrass 0
and 0
discredit 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
other 0
Republicans, 0
not 0
get 0
at 0
the 0
truth. 0

“It 0
is 0
going 0
against 0
everything 0
I’ve 0
seen 0
for 0
44 0
years," 0
huffed 0
committee 0
member 0
Patrick 0
Leahy 0
(D-Vt.). 0

"They’re 0
not 0
following 0
normal 0
procedure." 0

As 0
expected, 0
at 0
today’s 0
hearing 0
Kavanaugh 0
will 0
firmly 0
rebut 0
the 0
increasingly 0
outrageous 0
claims 0
being 0
leveled 0
at 0
him. 0

According 0
to 0
prepared 0
testimony 0
provided 0
to 0
The 0
Hill 0
newspaper, 0
he 0
will 0
say: 0

I 0
categorically 1
and 1
unequivocally 1
deny 1
the 0
allegation 0
against 0
me 0
by 0
Dr. 0
Ford. 0

I 0
never 0
had 0
any 0
sexual 0
or 0
physical 0
encounter 0
of 0
any 0
kind 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Ford. 0

I 0
am 0
not 0
questioning 0
that 0
Dr. 0
Ford 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
sexually 0
assaulted 0
by 0
some 0
person 0
in 0
some 0
place 0
at 0
some 0
time. 0

But 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
done 0
that 0
to 0
her 0
or 0
to 0
anyone. 0

Kavanaugh 0
added: 0
"I 0
am 0
innocent 0
of 0
this 0
charge." 0

Not 0
surprisingly 0
Ford’s 0
prepared 0
testimony 0
also 0
found 0
its 0
way 0
to 0
reporters. 0

“I 0
am 0
here 0
today 0
not 0
because 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
be,” 0
Ford 0
says 0
in 0
her 0
opening 0
statement. 0

“I 0
am 1
terrified. 1

I 0
am 0
here 0
because 0
I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
my 0
civic 0
duty 0
to 0
tell 0
you 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
me 0
while 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
in 0
high 0
school.” 0

She 0
describes 0
the 0
nominee 0
as 0
“Brett 1
Kavanaugh, 1
the 1
boy 1
who 1
sexually 1
assaulted 1
me,” 1
and 0
claims 0
“Brett’s 0
assault 0
on 0
me 0
drastically 1
altered 1
my 1
life,” 1
but 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
acknowledges 0
“Brett 0
did 0
not 0
rape 0
me.” 0

Given 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
already 0
passed 0
six 0
incredibly 0
intrusive 0
FBI 0
investigations, 0
odds 0
are 0
Ford 1
is 1
lying 1
or 1
suffering 1
from 1
some 1
kind 1
of 1
psychological 1
disorder 1
such 1
as 1
false 1
memory 1
syndrome. 1

Many 0
commentators 0
have 0
drawn 0
parallels 0
between 0
Ford 0
and 0
Anita 0
Hill, 0
who 0
in 0
1991 0
accused 0
then-Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
Clarence 0
Thomas 0
of 0
sexual 0
improprieties. 0

Both 0
women 0
are 0
college 0
professors. 0

Both 0
claim 0
to 0
have 0
reluctantly 0
been 0
drawn 0
into 0
confirmation 0
battles. 0

Ford 0
claims 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
attempted 0
rape; 0
Hill 0
claims 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
victim 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
the 0
workplace. 0

Only 0
left-wingers 1
and 1
feminists 1
like 1
Maureen 1
Dowd 1
still 0
believe 0
Hill, 0
now 0
an 0
utterly 1
undistinguished 1
politically 1
correct 1
scholar 1
who 0
discredited 0
herself 0
by 0
–among 0
other 0
things— 0
following 0
her 0
then-boss 0
Thomas 0
as 0
his 0
subordinate 0
when 0
he 0
switched 0
jobs. 0

An 0
abused 0
person 0
wouldn’t 0
do 0
that. 0

But 0
all 0
the 0
lies 0
about 0
Thomas 0
at 0
what 0
he 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
“high-tech 1
lynching 1
for 1
uppity 1
blacks” 1
had 0
an 0
effect. 0

In 0
the 0
end, 0
the 0
Senate 0
barely 0
approved 0
his 0
nomination 0
52 0
to 0
48 0
on 0
October 0
15, 0
1991. 0

With 0
all 0
the 0
mud 1
Democrats 1
have 1
been 1
slinging 1
at 1
Kavanaugh, 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
thrilled 0
to 0
be 0
approved 0
by 0
a 0
margin 0
as 0
wide 0
as 0
52 0
to 0
48. 0

Conservatives 0
need 0
to 0
remember 0
that 0
the 1
purpose 1
of 1
the 1
Left’s 1
frenzied, 1
demagogic 1
assault 1
is 1
to 1
damage 1
the 1
nominee, 1
and 1
by 1
extension, 1
the 1
president 1
who 1
nominated 1
him. 1

If 0
they 0
can 0
derail 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
that 0
is 0
an 0
added 0
bonus. 0

The 0
Left’s 0
attacks 0
on 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
#MeToo 0
era 0
are 0
working, 0
a 0
USA 0
Today 0
article 0
suggests: 0

Disapproval 0
for 0
Kavanaugh 0
… 0
is 0
at 0
an 0
unprecedented 0
level 0
for 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
amid 0
the 0
allegations 0
against 0
him, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
USA 0
TODAY/Ipsos 0
Public 0
Affairs 0
Poll. 0

Those 0
surveyed 0
said 0
by 0
40 0
percent 0
to 0
31 0
percent 0
that 0
the 0
Senate 0
shouldn't 0
vote 0
to 0
approve 0
his 0
nomination, 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
plurality 0
of 0
Americans 0
have 0
opposed 0
a 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominee 0
since 0
polling 0
on 0
the 0
issue 0
began. 0

The 0
case 0
against 0
confirming 0
Kavanaugh 0
may 0
be 0
somewhere 0
between 0
weak 0
and 0
non-existent, 0
but 0
the 0
constant 0
repetition 0
of 0
the 0
unsupported 0
allegations 0
in 0
the 0
Trump-hating 1
media 1
is 0
clearly 0
taking 0
its 0
toll 0
on 0
the 0
nominee. 0

That 0
said, 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
is 0
tentatively 0
scheduled 0
to 0
vote 0
on 0
the 0
nomination 0
Friday 0
at 0
9:30 0
a.m. 0

"If 0
we're 0
ready 0
to 0
vote, 0
we 0
will 0
vote,” 0
Chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
tweeted 0
Tuesday 0
at 0
6:46 0
p.m. 0
“If 0
we 0
aren't 0
ready, 0
we 0
won't.” 0

Obviously, 0
a 0
lot 0
is 0
riding 0
on 0
the 0
confirmation. 0

“We're 0
watching 0
a 0
period 0
where 0
what 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
understand 0
is 0
this 0
is 0
about 0
raw 0
power," 0
former 0
Speaker 0
of 0
the 0
House 0
Newt 0
Gingrich 0
(R-Ga.) 0
said 0
Tuesday. 0

"And 0
if 0
the 0
Left 0
can 0
stop 0
Kavanaugh 0
we 0
will 0
not 0
get 0
another 0
conservative 0
justice 0
in 0
our 0
lifetime 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court." 0

President 0
Trump 0
quoted 0
the 0
nation’s 0
most 0
prominent 0
conservative 0
radio 0
host 0
as 0
he 0
urged 0
GOP 0
senators 0
to 0
get 0
onboard 0
Tuesday: 0

“Rush 0
Limbaugh 0
to 0
Republicans: 0
‘You 1
can 1
kiss 1
the 1
MIDTERMS 1
goodbye 1
if 1
you 1
don’t 1

WASHINGTON 0

A 0

on 0

ordered 0

Judge 0
Timothy 0
Kelly, 0
a 1

said 0
the 0

had 0
violated 0

Fifth 0

to 0

without 0

or 0
a 0
chance 0
for 0

Kelly 0
said 0
White 0
House 0
officials 0
couldn’t 0
say 0
who 0
made 0
the 0
decision 0
or 0
how. 0

The 0

ordered 0
the 0

to 0
restore 0
the 0

the 0

What? 0

Neither 0

I 0

President 0

responded 0
to 0
the 0

He 0
told 0
Fox 0

Chris 0
Wallace, 0
"Yeah, 0
its 0
fine, 0
I 0
mean 0
it’s 0
not 0
a 0
big 0
deal. 0

What 0
they 0
said, 0
though, 0
is 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
create 0
rules 0
and 0
regulations 0
for 0
conduct 0
etc. 0

etc. 0

We’re 0
doing 0
that, 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
write 0
them 0
up 0
right 0
now. 0

It’s 0
not 0
a 0
big 0
deal 0
and 0
if 0
he 0
misbehaves, 0
we’ll 0
throw 0
him 0
out 0
or 0
we’ll 0
stop 0
the 0

In 0
speaking 0
about 0
the 0
rules 0
and 0
regulations 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
is 0
writing 0
up, 0
Trump 0
added, 0
"We’re 1
writing 1
them 1
now. 1

We’ll 0
have 0
rules 0

decorum, 0
you 0
know 0
you 0
can’t 0
keep 0
asking 0

many 1

in 0

they 0
were 0

this 0

up 0

starts, 0
you 0

doing 0
what 0
he’s 0
supposed 0

be 0
doing 0
for 0

for 0

you 0

out 0

You 0
know 0
that 0
isn't 0
going 0
to 0
stop 0
someone 0
like 0
Acosta, 0
who 0
claimed 0
to 0
deal 0
in 0
facts 0
and 0
truth, 0
but 0
clearly 0
demonstrated 0
he 0
was 0
all 1
about 1
lies 1
when 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
putting 0
his 0
hands 0
on 0
a 0
White 0

aide. 0

The 0
order 0
by 0
Judge 0
Kelly 0
is 0
a 0
temporary 0
one 0
that 0
lasts 0
for 0
14 0
days. 0

“I 0
will 0
say 0
this, 0
look, 0
nobody 1
believes 1
in 1
the 1
First 1
Amendment 1
more 1
than 1
I 1
do 1
and 0
if 0
I 0

somebody 0

out 0

I 0

Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0

issued 0
a 0
statement 0
following 0
the 0

“Today, 0

no 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0

we 0
will 0
temporarily 0
reinstate 0

can't 0

to 0

Perhaps 0
there 0
is 0
an 0
easier 0

around 0

Perhaps 0

Prime 0

Hits 1
Nail 1
On 1
The 1
Head: 1
Refugees 1
Are 1
Actually 1
"Muslim 1
Invaders" 1

Hungarian 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
doesn't 0
mince 0
words 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
Muslim 1
invasion 1
in 0
Europe 0
and 0
specifically 0
to 0
his 0
own 0
country. 0

Orban 0
says 0
there 0
is 0
not 0
only 0
Muslim 1
invaders 1
in 0
the 0
mix 0
of 0
"refugees," 0
but 0
also 0
“economic 0
migrants" 0
seeking 0
better 0
lives 0
for 0
themselves. 0

Indeed, 0
both 0
of 0
these 0
are 0
true. 0

There 0
are 0
plenty 0
of 0
these 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
simply 0
happy 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
place 0
to 0
live 0
after 0
many 0
were 0
driven 0
from 0
their 0
homes 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
US, 0
Russia 0
and 0
other 0
countries 0
putting 1
their 1
noses 1
where 0
they 0
didn't 0
belong 0
and 0
funding, 0
training 0
and 0
arming 0
Islamic 0
jihadis 0
there. 0

Then, 0
there 0
are 0
those 0
who 0
clearly 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
country 0
to 0
Islamasize 0
the 0
country 0
because 0
they 0
have 0
an 1
Islamic 1
dominionist 1
attitude 1
borne 0
of 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
Koran 0
and 0
Muhammad 0
. 0

RT 0
reports: 0

Refugees 0
in 0
Europe 0
are 0
just 0
“Muslim 1
invaders” 1
and 0
economic 0
migrants 0
seeking 0
better 0
lives, 0
Hungarian 0
PM 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
has 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
the 0
large 0
number 0
of 0
Muslims 0
in 0
the 0
EU 0
had 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
appearance 0
of 0
‘parallel 0
societies.’ 0
Asked 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
German 0
Bild 0
newspaper 0
why 0
Budapest 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
accept 0
any 0
refugees, 0
Orban 0
replied: 0
“We 0
don’t 0
consider 0
these 0
people 0
to 0
be 0
Muslim 0
refugees.” 0
Instead, 0
the 0
tough-talking 0
politician 0
said 0
they 0
were 0
regarded 0
as 0
“Muslim 1
invaders.” 1
Asylum 0
seekers 0
must 0
cross 0
four 0
countries 0
to 0
reach 0
Hungary 0
from 0
Syria, 0
all 0
of 0
which 0
are 0
not 0
as 0
rich 0
as 0
Germany 0
but 0
are 0
economically 0
stable, 0
the 0
PM 0
said. 0

He 0
was 0
apparently 0
referring 0
to 0
Turkey, 0
Greece, 0
Macedonia 0
and 0
Serbia 0
– 0
a 0
common 0
route 0
for 0
migrants 0
heading 0
for 0
‘wealthy’ 0
Europe. 0

“So, 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
running 0
for 0
their 0
lives 0
[in 0
these 0
countries]. 0

They 0
are 0
merely 0
economic 0
migrants 0
seeking 0
a 0
better 0
life,” 0
Orban 0
concluded. 0

He 0
stressed 0
though, 0
that 0
he 0
can 0
only 0
speak 0
for 0
the 0
Hungarians 0
and 0
they 1
“don’t 1
want” 1
immigration. 1

In 0
his 0
view, 0
the 0
government 0
simply 0
can’t 0
go 0
against 0
the 0
will 0
of 0
the 0
people. 0

And 0
Orban 0
has 0
stayed 0
the 0
course, 0
too 0
while 0
governments 0
like 0
that 0
of 0
Germany 0
have 0
ignored 0
their 0
people 0
to 0
allow 0
for 0
a 0
clear 0
invasion 0
of 0
Germany 0
that 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
untold 1
numbers 1
of 0
sexual 1
assaults 1
by 1
Muslim 1
migrants, 1
attacks 1
on 1
Christians 1
and 1
there's 1
no 1
telling 1
the 1
amount 1
of 1
damage 1
to 1
the 1
unethical 1
welfare 1
system 1
in 1
the 1
country. 1

RT 0
continues: 0

Going 0
further, 0
the 0
prime 0
minister 0
noted 0
that 0
no 0
refugee 0
wants 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
Portugal, 0
for 0
example, 0
adding 0
that 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
asylum 0
seekers 0
simply 0
wanted 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
prosperous 0
Germany. 0

“The 1
reason 1
why 1
people 1
are 1
in 1
your 1
country 1
is 1
not 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
refugees, 1
but 1
because 1
they 1
want 1
a 1
German 1
life,” 1
he 0
said, 0
describing 0
the 0
issue 0
“politically” 0
as 0
a 0
European 0
problem 0
but, 0
“sociologically,” 0
as 0
a 0
German 0
problem. 0

Orban 0
specifically 0
targeted 0
Germany 0
and 0
Chancellor 0
Angela 0
Merkel’s 0
‘open-door’ 0
policy 0
towards 0
asylum 0
seekers. 0

“I’ve 0
never 0
understood 0
how 0
chaos, 1
anarchy 1
and 1
illegal 1
border 1
crossings 1
are 0
viewed 0
as 0
something 0
good 0
in 0
a 0
country 0
like 0
Germany, 0
which 0
we 0
view 0
as 0
the 1
best 1
example 1
of 1
discipline 1
and 1
the 1
rule 1
of 1
law,” 1
he 0
said. 0

The 0
recent 0
wave 0
of 0
refugees 0
reaching 0
Europe 0
is 0
merely 0
an 0
invasion, 1
according 0
to 0
Orban. 0

“If 0
someone 0
wants 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
your 0
house, 0
he 0
knocks 0
on 0
your 0
door 0
and 0
asks: 0
‘Can 0
we 0
come 0
in, 0
can 0
we 0
stay?’ 0
They 0
[asylum 0
seekers] 0
didn’t 0
do 0
that, 0
they 0
crossed 0
the 0
border 0
illegally,” 0
he 0
stated. 0

Orban 0
then 0
did 0
what 0
most 0
political 0
representatives 0
will 0
simply 0
not 0
do, 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
multiculturalism. 0

He 0
called 0
it 0
an 0
"illusion" 0
and 0
said 0
that 0
Christian 1
and 1
Muslim 1
societies 1
“will 1
never 1
unite.” 1

Of 0
course, 0
they 0
won't. 0

They 1
have 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
in 1
common. 1

They 1
cannot 1
agree 1
on 1
God's 1
law, 1
which 1
most 1
Western 1
societies 1
were 1
base 1
on, 1
including 1
the 1
united 1
States. 1

They 1
cannot 1
agree 1
on 0
the 0
Scriptures. 0

They 1
cannot 1
agree 1
on 1
the 0
person 0
and 0
work 0
of 0
Jesus 0
the 0
Christ. 0

They 0
can't 0
even 0
agree 0
on 0
the 0
means 0
of 0
proselytizing 0
and 0
of 0
what 0
real 0
spiritual 0
weapons 0
are. 0

PM 0
Orban 0
has 0
remained 0
consistent. 0

He 0
has 0
publicly 0
told 0
the 0
Muslim 1
invaders 1
to 0
leave 1
Hungary 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back. 1

He 0
has 0
rebuffed 0
Brussels, 0
which 0
is 0
largely 0
Islamic, 0
and 0
told 0
them 0
that 0
Hungary 1
would 1
defend 1
its 1
borders, 1
and 1
it 1
has. 1

Orban's 0
border 0
wall 0
reduced 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
by 0
99%! 0

He 1
has 1
genuinely 1
reached 1
out 1
his 1
hand 1
to 1
help 1
Christian 1
migrants 1
instead 1
of 1
Muslim 1
migrants 1
and 1
he 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
one 1
that 1
holds 1
to 1
the 1
Christian 1
faith, 1
as 1
emulated 1
by 1
the 1
Protestant 1
Reformers, 1
saying, 1
"That 1
which 1
serves 1
the 1
glory 1
of 1
God 1
is 1
the 1
best 1
for 1
the 1
people." 1

Furthermore, 0
Orban 0
has 0
also 0
called 0
out 0
the 0
man 1
behind 1
the 1
curtain 1
in 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
promoting 0
of 0
this 0
Muslim 1
invasion 1
of 0
the 0
West, 0
George 0
Soros. 0

Anti-jihadist 0
activist 0
Pamela 0
Geller 0
praised 0
Orban 0
for 0
his 0
honesty 0
and 0
wrote, 0
"At 0
last, 0
a 0
politician 0
who 0
speaks 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
the 0
Muslim 1
invasion 1
of 0
Europe. 0

And 0
while 0
Orban 0
is 0
right 0
that 0
these 0
are 0
'economic 0
migrants,' 0
they 0
are 0
also 0
'Muslim 1
invaders.'" 1

"They 0
don’t 0
want 0
a 0
'German 0
life' 0
in 0
Germany 0
in 0
the 0
sense 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
willing 0
to 0
accept 0
German 0
values," 0
she 0
added. 0

"Many, 1
all 1
too 1
many, 1
of 0
them 1
want 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
German 1
values, 1
and 1
European 1
values 1
in 1
general, 1
with 1
sharia 1
values. 1

They 1
are 1
in 1
Europe 1
to 1
conquer 1
and 1
Islamize 1
it, 1
with 1
willing 1
and 1
eager 1
help 1
from 1
Europe’s 1
short-sighted, 1
self-serving, 1
internationalist 1
intelligentsia." 1

Indeed! 1

Thank 1
you 1
Prime 1
Minister 1
Orban 1
for 1
saying 1
what 1
needed 1
to 1
be 1
said! 1

was 0
a 0
person 0
of 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
mass 0

As 0
a 0

said 0
that 0
he 0

he 0
said 0
at 0

"People 0

But 0
Haig 0
is 0
an 0
engineer, 0
and 0
he 0
says 0
he's 0
not 0
a 0
former 0
military 0
officer. 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
Haig's 0
rounds 0
were 0
probably 0
not 0
even 0
used 0
in 0
the 0
massacre: 0
Haig 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
tracer 0
ammunition, 0
which 0
emit 0
a 0
flare 0
when 0
fired 0
making 0
them 0
easier 0
to 0
see. 0

Had 0
Paddock 0
fired 0
these 0
rounds 0
during 0
the 0
nighttime 0
massacre 0
at 0
the 0
concert, 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
visible. 0

Haig's 0
attorney 0
Marc 0
Victor 0
told 0
reporters 0
it 0
was 0
perfectly 0
legal 0
for 0
Haig, 0
a 0
private 0
citizen, 0
to 0
sell 0
Paddock 0
hundreds 0
of 0
rounds 0
of 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
— 0
the 0
bullets 0
are 0
legal 0
in 0
Arizona. 0

Paddock 0
showed 0
up 0
to 0
buy 0
ammunition 0
at 0
Haig's 0
home 0
after 0
meeting 0
him 0
at 0
a 0
gun 0
show 0
in 0
Phoenix. 0

"I 0
sold 0
him 0
600 0
rounds 0
of 0
.308 0
tracer, 0
surplus 0
U.S. 0
military. 0

I 0
sold 0
him 0
120 0
rounds 0
of 0
.556 0
tracer, 0
again, 0
surplus 0
U.S. 0
military," 0
Haig 0
said 0
to 0
ABC15. 0

"I 0
put 0
it 0
in 0
a 0
box 0
for 0
him. 0

He 0
paid 0
me, 0
put 0
it 0
in 0
his 0
car, 0
and 0
left." 0

Haig 0
said 0
he's 0
been 0
legally 0
selling 0
ammunition 0
as 0
as 0
a 0
hobby 0
since 0
1991, 0
but 0
after 0
the 0
massacre, 0
he 0
has 0
stopped 0
his 0
side 0
business. 0

It 0
wasn't 0
unusual 0
for 0
a 0
customer 0
to 0
buy 0
over 0
700 0
rounds, 0
he 0
said. 0

"I've 1
seen 1
all 1
kinds 1
of 1
people. 1

There 1
were 1
no 1
tells," 1
Haig 0
said 0
of 0
Paddock. 0

When 0
asked 0
about 0
the 0
threats, 0
Haig 0
said, 0
“I’ve 0
had 0
people 0
screaming 0
they 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
die 0
through 0
my 0
front 0
door." 0

Haig 0
and 0
his 0
attorney 0
did 0
not 0
immediately 0
respond 0
to 0
requests 0
for 0
comment 0
on 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
theorizing. 0

Haig 0
said 0
he's 0
sorry 0
that 0
the 0
massacre 0
took 0
place, 0
but 0
emphasized 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
Paddock's 0
mass 0
shooting. 0

“I 0
had 0
no 0
contribution 0
to 0
what 0
Paddock 0
did,” 0
Haig 0
said 0
at 0
the 0
news 0
conference. 0

“I 0
had 1
no 1
way 1
to 1
see 1
into 1
his 1
mind. 1

The 0
product 0
that 0
I 0
sold 0
him 0
had 1
absolutely 1
nothing 1
to 1
do 1
with 0
what 0
he 0
did.” 0

Nevertheless, 0
it's 0
hard 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
Haig's 0
denials 0
will 0
dissuade 0
the 0
conspiracy-mongers. 0

Jake 0
Morphonios 0
said 0
that 0
for 0
all 0
he 0
knows, 0
Doug 0
Haig 0
didn't 0
play 0
a 0
role 0
in 0
Paddock's 0
massacre. 0

Even 0
so, 0
Morphonious 0
still 0
parlayed 0
an 0
innocent-until-proven-guilty 0

into 0

“drove 0

just 0
can’t 0

have 0

Kazi’s 0
motive. 0

And 0
that 0
in 0
a 0
nutshell 0
shows 0
what’s 0
wrong 0
with 0
today’s 0
FBI. 0

Sean 0
Ragan, 0
FBI 0
special 0
agent 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
Sacramento 0
field 0
office, 0
stated: 0
“We 0
don’t 0
have 0
any 0
nexus 0
of 0
terrorism 0
at 0
this 0
point. 0

Now 0
the 0
question 0
is, 0
why. 0

Why 0
was 0
he 0
there? 0

What 0
led 0
him 0
there? 0

And 0
we 0
don’t 0
know 0

noted 0
that 0
when 0
emergency 0

approached 0
the 0
burning 0
van 0
after 0
it 0
crashed, 0
“they 0
found 0
five 0

Yes, 0
what 0
Kazi 0
could 0
possibly 0
have 0
been 0
up 0
to 0
is 0
a 0
complete 0
mystery. 0

The 0

added 0
that 0
“the 0
dead 0

are 0
not 0

at 0

that 0
some 0

of 0
‘jihad’ 0

no 0

to 0
Sean 0
Ragan. 0

What 0
is 0
a 0
nexus 0
of 0

Ragan 1
most 1
likely 1
means 1
that 1
investigators 1
didn’t 1
find 1
an 1

membership 1
card 1
in 1
Kazi’s 1
wallet, 1
or 1
lots 1
of 1
phone 1
calls 1
to 1
Iraq 1
or 1
Syria, 1
or 1
a 1
note 1
from 1
Kazi 1
reading, 1
“I 1
did 1
this 1
for 1
Allah 1
and 1
Islam. 1

Allahu 1
akbar.” 1

Of 0
course, 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
had 0
found 0
those 0
things, 0
given 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
recent 0
track 0
record 0
of 0
denial 0
and 0
deception, 0
they 0
may 0
still 0
be 0
searching 0
for 0
Kazi’s 0
motive. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
a 0
larger 0
point 0
is 0
being 0
lost 0
here. 0

And 0
that 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
war 0
going 0
on. 0

We 1
know 1
that 1
the 1
Islamic 1
State, 1
al-Qaeda 1
and 1
other 1
groups 1
have 1
called 1
upon 1
Muslims 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
to 1
try 1
to 1
kill 1
military 1
personnel 1
and 1
police, 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
civilians. 1

We 0
know 0
that 0
Kazi, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
propane 0
and 0
gas 0
tanks 0
in 0
his 0
car, 0
was 0
clearly 0
trying 0
to 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
major 0
fire 0
that 0
would 0
kill 0
more 0
people 0
than 0
just 0
himself. 0

Even 0
if 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
to 0
Baghdadi, 0
the 0
likelihood 0
is 0
that 0
when 0
a 0
Muslim 0
drives 0
into 0
a 0
U.S. 0
Air 0
Force 0
Base 0
with 0
a 0
car 0
full 0
of 0
incendiaries, 0
probably 0
this 0
has 0
something 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
global 0
jihad. 0

The 1
FBI’s 1
bafflement 1
here 1
is 1
part 1
of 1
its 1
deep, 1
deep 1
corruption. 1

The 1
FBI 1
doesn’t 1
acknowledge 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
global 1
jihad, 1
or 1
that 1
Islam 1
has 1
anything 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
terrorism. 1

It 1
doesn’t 1
admit 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
war 1
going 1
on, 1
and 1
treats 1
each 1
act 1
of 1
Islamic 1
terror 1
as 1
if 1
it 1
were 1
a 1
separate 1
and 1
discrete 1
criminal 1
event, 1
unrelated 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
others. 1

So 1
each 1
time 1
something 1
like 1
this 1
happens, 1
they’re 1
back 1
at 1
Square 1
One, 1
trying 1
to 1
figure 1
out 1
motive. 1

It’s 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Army 0
stopped 0
to 0
interrogate 0
every 0
German 0
soldier 0
who 0
crashed 0
through 0
the 0
Ardennes 0
Forest 0
at 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Battle 0
of 0
the 0
Bulge 0
in 0
1944, 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
each 0
one’s 0
actions 0
had 0
anything 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
German 1
Army 1
and 1
Adolf 1
Hitler’s 1
war 0
aims. 0

Authorities 0
are 0
also 0
investigating 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Kazi 0
was 0
suffering 0
from 0
any 0
mental 0
health 0
issues. 0

Here 0
again, 0
this 0
is 0
just 0
more 0
of 0
the 0
general 0
refusal 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
the 1
800-pound 1
gorilla 1
sitting 0
in 0
the 0
living 0
room 0
and 0
screaming 1
“Allahu 1
akbar.” 1
Sean 0
Ragan 0
might 0
explain 0
to 0
us 0
that 0
authorities 0
are 0
also 0
trying 0
to 0
determine 0
whether 0
the 0
German 1
invasion 1
of 1
Poland 1
in 1
September 1
1939 1
was 1
motivated 1
by 1
Nazism, 1
or 0
by 0
mental 0
health 0
issues 0
among 0
the 0
German 0
High 0
Command. 0

This 0
willful 0
ignorance 0
leads 0
to 0
a 0
diversion 0
and 0
waste 0
of 0
resources 0
that 0
is 0
astronomical 1
and 1
catastrophic. 1

How 0
long 0
is 0
this 0
comic 0
opera 0
going 0
to 0
continue? 0

If 0
the 0
jihadis 0
advance 0
even 0
into 0
the 0
FBI’s 0
Sacramento 0
offices, 0
will 0
agents 0
there 0
be 0
struggling 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
jihadis’ 0
motive 0
even 0
as 0
the 1
machete 1
begins 1
to 1
slice 1
through 1
their 1
necks? 1

Israel's 0
repeated 0
warnings, 0
Barack 1
Obama's 1
reckless 1
appeasement 1
of 1
the 1
Iranian 1
regime 1
has 1
enabled 1
its 1
rise 1
as 1
a 1
hegemonic 1
threat 1
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
region 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
international 0
peace 0
and 0
security. 0

In 0
2009, 0
Obama 0
turned 1
his 1
back 1
on 1
millions 1
of 1
dissidents 1
in 0
the 0
streets 0
of 0
Tehran 0
and 0

cities, 0
who 0
were 0
peacefully 0
protesting 0
the 0
rigged 0
election 0
of 0
Mahmoud 0
Ahmadinejad 0
as 0
president. 0

In 0
2011, 0
Obama 0
precipitously 0
removed 0
the 0
remaining 0
U.S. 0
combat 0
troops 0
from 0
Iraq, 0
giving 1
rise 1
to 1
ISIS’s 1
re-emergence 1
in 1
Iraq 1
from 0
its 0
bases 0
in 0
Syria. 0

The 0
radical 0
Shiite 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
purported 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
the 0
“rescue” 0
of 0
both 0
countries 0
from 0
the 0
Sunni 0
terrorists, 0
turning 1
Iraq 1
into 1
a 1

vassal 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
largest 1
state 1
sponsor 1
of 1
terrorism 1
in 0
the 0
process. 0

Obama's 0
disastrous 1
nuclear 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran 0
legitimized 1
Iran's 1
path 1
to 1
eventually 1
becoming 1
a 1
nuclear-armed 1
state, 1
while 0
immediately 0
filling 0
its 0
coffers 0
with 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
to 0
fund 0
its 0
aggression. 0

Meanwhile, 0
Syria 0
has 0
become 0
ground 0
zero 0
for 0
Iran's 0
execution 0
of 0
its 0
regional 0
ambitions, 0
which 0
is 0
to 0
establish 0
its 0
Shiite 0
Crescent 0
connecting 0
with 0
its 0
allies, 0
including 0
Iraq, 0
Syria 0
and 0
Lebanon. 0

This 0
plan 0
has 0
included 0
the 0
establishment 0
of 0
a 0
land 0
route 0
that 0
Iranian-backed 0
militias 0
secured 0
in 0
June, 0
beginning 0
on 0
Iran’s 0
border 0
with 0
Iraq 0
and 0
running 0
across 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
to 0
Syria’s 0
Mediterranean 0
coast. 0

This 0
road 0
makes 0
Iran’s 0
job 0
easier 0
in 0
supplying 0
arms 0
by 0
land, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
by 0
air 0
and 0
sea, 0
to 0
prop 0
up 0
Syrian 0
President 0
Bashar 0
al-Assad’s 0
regime 0
and 0
to 0
equip 0
Iran’s 0
own 0
forces 0
fighting 0
inside 0
of 0
Syria 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
Assad. 0

This 0
helps 0
explain 0
why 0
Iran 0
has 0
placed 0
so 0
much 0
importance 0
on 0
helping 0
the 0
Syrian 0
regime 0
establish 0
control 0
over 0
the 0
Deir 0
ez-Zor 0
area 0
in 0
eastern 0
Syria, 0
near 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
border. 0

“Everything 0
depends 0
now 0
on 0
the 0
Americans’ 0
willingness 0
to 0
stop 0
this,” 0
said 0
an 0
Iraqi 0
Kurdish 0
official 0
who 0
was 0
quoted 0
in 0
a 0
New 0
Yorker 0
article. 0

However, 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
forces 0
apparently 0
have 0
done 0
next 0
to 0
nothing 0
to 0
stop 0
this 0
major 0
advance 0
in 0
Iran’s 0
Shiite 0
Crescent 0
expansion. 0

“Obama 0
ran 0
down 0
our 0
options 0
in 0
Syria 0
so 0
thoroughly, 0
by 0
the 0
time 0
this 0
administration 0
took 0
over,” 0
said 0
Andrew 0
Tabler, 0
senior 0
fellow 0
at 0
the 0
Washington 0
Institute 0
for 0
Near 0
East 0
Policy. 0

“The 0
Iranian 0
influence 0
is 0
spreading 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
so 0
heavily 0
involved 0
in 0
regime 0
activities,” 0
Tabler 0
added. 0

“It’s 1
a 1
new 1
monster.” 1

Furthermore, 0
Iran 0
has 0
funded 0
and 0
armed 0
its 0
terrorist 0
proxy 0
Hezbollah, 0
which 0
has 0
sent 0
its 0
militia 0
from 0
its 0
home 0
base 0
of 0
Lebanon 0
to 0
fight 0
alongside 0
Assad's 0
forces. 0

And 0
Iran 0
has 0
used 0
Syria 0
as 0
a 0
transit 0
point 0
for 0
shipment 0
of 0
sophisticated 0
rockets 0
to 0
Hezbollah 0
in 0
Lebanon 0
for 0
future 0
use 0
against 0
Israeli 0
population 0
centers. 0

Despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Hezbollah 0
has 0
American 1
blood 1
on 0
its 0
hands, 0
the 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
has 0
chosen 0
not 0
to 0
do 0
anything 0
about 0
Hezbollah’s 0
presence 0
in 0
Syria, 0
bought 0
and 0
paid 0
for 0
by 0
Iran. 0

While 0
Israel 0
chose 0
not 0
to 0
take 0
sides 0
in 0
Syria's 0
civil 0
war 0
with 0
military 0
intervention 0
of 0
its 0
own, 0
it 0
has 0
bombed 0
weapons 0
storage 0
facilities 0
and 0
convoys 0
inside 0
Syria 0
for 0
its 0
own 0
protection. 0

Just 0
recently, 0
on 0
September 0
7th, 0
Israeli 0
jets 0
struck 0
a 0
Syrian 0
weapons 0
facility 0
near 0
Masyaf, 0
which 0
was 0
reported 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
used 0
for 0
the 0
production 0
of 0
chemical 0
weapons 0
and 0
the 0
storage 0
of 0
missiles. 0

Israel 0
will 0
also 0
do 0
what 0
is 0
necessary 0
to 0
repel 0
Iranian-backed 0
forces 0
if 0
they 0
edge 0
too 0
close 0
to 0
areas 0
near 0
the 0
Golan 0
Heights, 0
shrinking 0
the 0
buffer 0
between 0
Israel 0
and 0
Iranian 0
controlled 0
territories. 0

However, 0
such 0
tactical 0
measures 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
thwart 0
Iran’s 0
larger 0
ambitions. 0

In 0
light 0
of 0
intelligence 0
reports 0
that 0
Assad 0
may 0
be 0
ready 0
to 0
invite 0
Iran 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
military 0
bases 0
in 0
Syria, 0
Israeli 0
leaders 0
have 0
concluded 0
that 0
they 0
cannot 0
wait 0
until 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
decides 0
to 0
deal 0
more 0
forcefully 0
with 0
Iran's 0
growing 0
use 0
of 0
Syria 0
as 0
a 0
staging 0
area 0
for 0
carrying 0
out 0
its 0
expansionist 0
Shiite 0
Crescent 0
strategy. 0

“Their 0
overriding 0
concern 0
in 0
Syria 0
is 0
the 0
free 0
reign 0
that 0
all 0
the 0
major 0
players 0
there 0
seem 0
willing 0
to 0
afford 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
various 0
proxies 0
in 0
the 0
country,” 0
wrote 0
Jonathan 0
Spyer 0
in 0
an 0
article 0
for 0
Foreign 0
Policy. 0

As 0
long 0
as 0
nobody 0
else 0
is 0
addressing 0
the 0
concern 0
Iran’s 0
growing 0
control 0
raises 0
in 0
a 0
satisfactory 0
manner, 0
“Israel 0
is 0
determined 0
to 0
continue 0
addressing 0
it 0
on 0
its 0
own.” 0

At 0
least, 0
Israel 0
has 0
a 0
more 0
sympathetic 0
ear 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
than 0
it 0
did 0
in 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
for 0
raising 0
its 0
concerns 0
about 0
Iran’s 0
growing 0
threat, 0
not 0
only 0
to 0
Israel 0
but 0
to 0
U.S. 0
interests 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
and 0
beyond. 0

President 0
Trump’s 0
sharp 0
denunciation 0
of 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
during 0
his 0
address 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
General 0
Assembly 0
represented 0
a 0
welcome 0
departure 0
from 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
milquetoast 1
approach 0
to 0
Iran. 0

As 0
the 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
continues 0
to 0
drive 0
ISIS 0
from 0
its 0
bases 0
of 0
operation 0
in 0
Syria, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
proclaimed 0
its 0
intention 0
not 0
to 0
allow 0
Iran 0
to 0
turn 0
Syria 0
into 0
its 0
own 0
satellite, 0
as 0
Iran 0
has 0
essentially 0
done 0
in 0
Iraq. 0

National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
H.R. 0

McMaster 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
“so 0
called 0
liberation 0
of 0
areas 0
by 0
Assad’s 0
forces 0
and 0
Iranian 0
proxies 0
could 1
actually 1
accelerate 1
the 1
cycle 1
of 1
violence 1
and 1
perpetuate 1
conflict 1
rather 1
than 1
get 1
us 1
to 1
a 1
sustainable 1
outcome.” 1
He 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
“objectives 0
are 0
to 0
weaken 0
Iranian 0
influence 0
across 0
the 0
region 0
broadly,” 0
without 0
discussing 0
the 0
means 0
to 0
accomplish 0
those 0
objectives. 0

Whether 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
follows 1
through 1
remains 1
to 1
be 1
seen. 1

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
Israel 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
fallout 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
ambitions 0
in 0
Syria 0
itself. 0

THE 0
OPPORTUNITIES 0
AND 0
RISKS 0
OF 0
TRUMP'S 0
IRAN 0
INITIATIVE 0

Originally 0
published 0
the 0
Jerusalem 0
Post. 0

On 0
Friday, 0
US 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
initiated 0
an 0
important 0
change 0
in 0
US 0
policy 0
toward 0
Iran. 0

No, 0

in 0
his 0
speech 0
decertifying 0
Iran’s 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
nuclear 0
accord 0
it 0
struck 0
with 0
his 0
predecessor 0
Barack 0
Obama, 0
Trump 0
didn’t 0
announce 0
a 0
new 0
strategy 0
for 0
preventing 0
Iran 0
from 0
acquiring 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
or 0
stemming 0
its 0
hegemonic 0
rise 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East, 0
or 0
limiting 0
its 0
ability 0
to 0
sponsor 0
terrorism. 0

Trump’s 0
move 0
was 0
not 0
operational. 0

It 0
was 0
directional. 0

In 0

his 0
address 0
Friday, 0
Trump 0
changed 0
the 0
policy 0
dynamics 0
that 0
dictate 0
US 0
policy 0
on 0
Iran. 0

For 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
since 0
2009, 0
when 0
Obama 0
backed 0
the 0
murderous 1
regime 1
in 0
Tehran, 0
spurning 0
the 0
millions 0
of 0
Iranians 0
who 0
rose 0
up 0
in 0
the 0
Green 0
Revolution, 0
Trump 0
opened 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
may 0
begin 0
to 0
base 0
its 0
policies 0
toward 0
Iran 0
on 0
reality. 0

Trump 0

began 0
his 0
remarks 0
by 0
setting 0
out 0
Iran’s 1
long 1
rap 1
sheet 1
of 1
aggression 1
against 1
America. 1

Starting 0

with 0
the 0
US 0
embassy 0
seizure 1
and 1
hostage 1
crisis, 1
Trump 1
described 1
Iran’s 1
crimes 1
and 1
acts 1
of 1
war 1
against 1
America 1
in 0
greater 0
detail 0
than 0
any 0
of 0
his 0
predecessors 0
ever 0
did. 0

Trump’s 0

dossier 0
was 0
interlaced 0
with 0
condemnations 0
of 0
the 0
regime’s 0
repression 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
people. 0

By 0

merging 0
Iran’s 0
external 0
aggression 0
with 0
its 0
internal 0
repression, 0
Trump 0
signaled 0
a 0
readiness 0
to 0
drive 0
a 0
wedge 0
– 0
or 0
expand 0
the 0
wedge 0
– 0
between 0
the 1
authoritarian 1
theocrats 1
that 0
rule 0
Iran 0
and 0
the 0
largely 0
secular, 0
multiethnic 0
and 0
pro-Western 0
people 0
of 0
Iran. 0

Trump 0

then 0
turned 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
illicit 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
program, 0
its 0
sponsorship 1
of 1
terrorism, 1
including 0
its 0
links 0
to 0
al-Qaida, 0
its 0
aggression 0
against 0
its 0
neighbors, 0
its 0
aggressive 0
acts 0
against 0
maritime 0
traffic 0
in 0
the 0
Straits 0
of 0
Hormuz, 0
and 0
its 0
bids 0
to 0
destabilize 0
and 0
control 0
large 0
swaths 0
of 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
through 0
its 0
proxies. 0

It 0

is 0
notable 0
that 0
these 0
remarks 0
preceded 0
Trump’s 0
discussion 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
– 0
which 0
was 0
the 0
ostensible 0
subject 0
of 0
his 0
speech. 0

Before 0
Trump 0
discussed 0
Iran’s 0
breaches 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
he 0
first 0
demonstrated 0
that 0
contrary 0
to 0
the 0
expressed 0
views 0
of 0
his 0
top 0
advisers, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
limit 0
a 0
realistic 0
discussion 0
of 0
the 1
threat 1
Iran 1
constitutes 1
to 1
US 1
national 1
security 1
and 1
interests 1
to 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
and 0
it 0
what 0
manner 0
it 0
is 0
breaching 0
the 0
nuclear 0
accord. 0

This 0

was 0
a 0
critical 0
point 0
because 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
two 0
years, 0
US 0
discourse 0
on 0
Iran 0
has 0
focused 0
solely 0
on 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Iran 0
was 0
complying 0
with 0
Obama’s 0
nuclear 0
pact. 0

By 0
placing 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
consistent, 0
overarching 1
hostility 1
and 1
aggression, 1
Trump 0
made 0
it 0
self-evident 0
that 0
no 0
US 0
interest 0
is 0
served 0
in 0
continuing 0
to 0
give 0
Iran 0
a 0
free 0
pass 0
from 0
congressional 0
sanctions. 0

After 0

accomplishing 0
that 0
goal, 0
Trump 0
turned 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
how 0
Iran 0
is 0
actually 0
breaching 0
the 0
letter 0
and 0
spirit 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
pact. 0

Only 0
then, 0
almost 0
as 0
an 0
afterthought, 0
did 0
he 0
announce 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
decertifying 0
Iranian 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
setting 0
the 0
conditions 0
for 0
the 0
renewal 0
of 0
congressional 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
and 0
opening 0
the 0
floodgates 0
of 0
congressional 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
in 0
retaliation 0
for 0
the 0
full 0
spectrum 0
of 0
its 0
aggressive 1
and 1
illicit 1
acts 1
against 1
the 1
US, 1
its 1
interests 1
and 1
allies. 1

By 0

empowering 0
Congress 0
to 0
prohibit 0
economic 0
cooperation 0
with 0
Iran, 0
Trump 0
put 0
the 0
Europeans, 0
Chinese 0
and 0
Russians 0
on 0
notice 0
that 0
they 0
may 0
soon 0
face 0
a 0
choice 0
between 0
conducting 0
business 0
with 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
conducting 0
business 0
with 0
Iran. 0

After 0

putting 0
them 0
on 0
notice, 0
Trump 0
discussed 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
improving 0
Obama’s 0
nuclear 0
accord. 0

Among 0
other 0
things, 0
he 0
suggested 0
expanding 0
the 0
inspection 0
regime 0
against 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
installations 0
and 0
canceling 0
the 0
so-called 0
“sunset” 0
clause 0
that 0
places 0
an 0
end 0
date 0
on 0
the 0
restrictions 0
governing 0
certain 0
components 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
advancement. 0

Trump’s 0

address 0
has 0
the 0
potential 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
the 0
foundation 0
of 0
a 0
major, 0
positive 0
shift 0
in 0
US 0
policy 0
toward 0
Iran. 0

Such 0
a 0
shift 0
could 0
potentially 0
facilitate 0
the 0
achievement 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
goals 0
of 0
preventing 0
Iran 0
from 0
acquiring 0
nuclear 0
weapons, 0
containing 0
its 0
regional 0
aggression 0
and 0
empowerment 0
and 0
defeating 0
its 0
terrorist 0
proxies. 0

Unfortunately, 1

it 1
is 1
also 1
likely, 1
indeed, 1
it 1
is 1
more 1
likely, 1
that 1
his 1
words 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
translated 1
into 1
policies 1
to 1
achieve 1
these 1
critical 1
aims. 1

Trump’s 0

decision 0
to 0
transfer 0
immediate 0
responsibility 0
to 0
Congress 0
for 0
holding 0
Iran 0
accountable 0
for 0
its 0
hostile 0
actions 0
on 0
the 0
military 0
and 0
other 0
fronts 0
is 0
a 0
risky 0
move. 0

He 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
enemies, 0
and 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
has 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
supporters 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill. 0

Obama 0

would 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
implement 0
his 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
if 0
Senator 0
Bob 0
Corker, 0
chairman 0
of 0
the 0
Senate 0
Foreign 0
Affairs 0
Committee, 0
hadn’t 0
agreed 0
to 0
cast 0
the 0
Constitution 0
aside 0
and 0
ignore 0
Obama’s 0
constitutional 0
duty 0
to 0
present 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
for 0
ratification 0
as 0
a 0
treaty. 0

Over 0

the 0
past 0
week, 0
Trump 0
and 0
Corker 0
have 0
been 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
ugly 1
public 1
fight 1
precipitated 0
by 0
Corker’s 0
announcement 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
seeking 0
reelection 0
next 0
year. 0

Today 0

Corker 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
restrain 0
him 0
from 0
scuttling 0
Trump’s 0
agenda. 0

If 0
he 0
wishes, 0
out 0
of 0
spite, 0
Corker 0
can 0
block 0
effective 0
sanctions 0
from 0
being 0
passed. 0

And 0
he 0
may 0
do 0
so 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
implications 0
for 0
his 0
Senate 0
colleagues 0
would 0
be 0
dire 0
and 0
even 0
though 0
doing 0
so 0
would 0
render 0
him 0
an 0
unofficial 0
protector 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
program. 0

What 0

is 0
true 0
for 0
Corker 0
is 0
doubly 0
true 0
for 0
the 0
Democrats. 0

Leading 0

Democratic 0
senators 0
like 0
Robert 0
Menendez, 0
Ben 0
Cardin 0
and 0
Chuck 0
Schumer, 0
who 0
opposed 0
Obama’s 0
Iran 0
deal 0
may 0
now 0
feel 0
that 0
as 0
opponents 0
of 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration, 0
they 0
are 0
required 0
to 0
oppose 0
any 0
change 0
to 0
the 0
Iran 0
Nuclear 0
Agreement 0
Review 0
Act. 0

Indeed, 0

given 0
the 0
rise 0
of 0
radical 0
forces 0
in 0
their 0
party 0
it 0
is 0
likely 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
rather 0
give 0
Iran 0
a 0
free 0
pass 0
for 0
its 0
anti-American 0
aggression 0
and 0
nuclear 0
proliferation 0
than 0
work 0
with 0
Republicans 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Then 0

again, 0
by 0
framing 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
threat 0
to 0
America 0
as 0
he 0
did, 0
and 0
by 0
transferring 0
responsibility 0
for 0
reinstating 0
sanctions 0
and 0
passing 0
further 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Iran 0
to 0
Congress, 0
Trump 0
opened 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
Congress 0
will 0
conduct 0
substantive 0
– 0
rather 0
than 0
personal 0
– 0
debates 0
on 0
Iran. 0

And 0

the 0
more 0
substantive 0
those 0
debates 0
become, 0
the 0
further 0
away 0
the 0
US 0
discourse 0
will 0
move 0
from 0
the 0
mendacious 0
assumptions 0
of 0
Obama’s 0
Iran 0
policy 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
is 0
a 0
responsible 0
actor 0
and 0
potential 0
US 0
ally, 0
and 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
inherently 0
aggressive 0
or 0
problematic 0
about 0
Iran’s 0
illicit 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
program. 0

The 0

second 0
major 0
risk 0
inherent 0
in 0
Trump’s 0
approach 0
is 0
that 0
he 0
will 0
get 0
his 0
way; 0
that 0
the 0
Europeans, 0
Russians 0
and 0
Chinese 0
and 0
the 0
Iranians 0
will 0
agree 0
to 0
improve 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

The 0
problem 0
here 0
is 0
not 0
obvious. 0

Clearly, 0
it 0
is 0
better 0
if 0
the 0
deal 0
is 0
amended 0
to 0
delete 0
the 0
sunset 0
clauses 0
and 0
expand 0
the 0
inspections 0
regime. 0

Yet 0

even 0
an 0
amended, 0
improved 0
deal 0
will 0
still 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
shield 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
program. 0

An 0
improved 0
deal 1
won’t 1
destroy 1
Iran’s 0
centrifuges. 0

It 1

won’t 1
take 0
away 0
Iran’s 0
enriched 0
uranium. 0

It 1
won’t 1
destroy 1
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
installations. 0

And 0
it 1
won’t 1
bring 1
down 0
the 0
regime 0
which 0
by 0
its 0
nature 0
ensures 0
all 0
of 0
these 0
things 0
will 0
remain 0
a 1
menace 1
to 1
the 1
US, 1
its 1
allies 1
and 1
international 1
security 1
as 1
a 1
whole. 1

So 0

long 0
as 0
the 0
US 0
continues 0
to 0
maintain 0
a 0
policy 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
false 0
view 0
that 0
all 0
that 0
is 0
necessary 0

the 1
most 1
outspoken 1
supporter 1
of 0
decertifying 0

in 0

Trump 0
administration, 0
told 0
NBC 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
intends 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

To 0

understand 0
what 0
must 0
be 0
done 0
we 0
must 0
return 0
to 0
Trump’s 0
speech 0
and 0
its 0
strategic 0
significance. 0

By 0

taking 0
a 0
holistic 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
Iranian 0
threat 0
– 0
grounded 0
in 0
a 0
recognition 0
of 0
the 0
inherent 0
hostility 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
– 0
Trump 0
opened 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
its 0
allies 0
can 0
develop 0
a 0
holistic 0
policy 0
for 0
confronting 0
and 0
defeating 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
proxies. 0

If 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal 0
and 0
sanctions 0
are 0
two 0
components 0
to 0
a 0
larger 0
strategy 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
entire 0
strategy, 0
they 0
can 0
be 0
helpful. 0

A 0

wider 0
strategy 0
would 0
target 0
Iran’s 0
regional 0
aggression 0
by 0
weakening 0
its 0
proxies 0
and 0
clients 0
from 0
Hezbollah 0
and 0
Hamas 0
to 0
the 0
regimes 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Yemen, 0
Syria 0
and 0
Lebanon. 0

It 0
would 0
target 0
the 0
regime 0
itself 0
by 0
empowering 0
the 0
ayatollahs’ 0
domestic 0
opponents. 0

It 0
would 0
pin 0
down 0
Iranian 0
forces 0
by 0
arming 0
and 0
otherwise 0
assisting 0
the 0
Iraqi 0
Kurds 0
to 0
defend 0
and 0
maintain 0
their 0
control 0
over 0
their 0
territory 0
along 0
the 0
Iranian 0
border 0
while 0
strengthening 0
the 0
ties 0
between 0
Iranian 0
Kurds 0
and 0
Iraqi 0
Kurds. 0

Friday, 0

Trump 0
created 0
the 0
possibility 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
strategy. 0

It 0
is 0
up 0
to 0
members 0
of 0
Congress, 0
and 0
US 0
allies 0
like 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Sunni 0
Arab 0
states 0
to 0
help 0
Trump 0
conceive 0
and 0
implement 0
it. 0

If 1
they 1
fail, 1
the 1
possibility 1
Trump 1
created 1
will 1
be 1
lost, 1
perhaps 1
irrevocably. 1

answers 0
about 0
her 0
past 0
involvement 0
in 0
state 0
sponsored 0

programs. 0

As 0
I 0
noted 0
earlier 0
today, 0
Haspel’s 0
long 0
career 0
at 0
the 0
CIA 0
spanned 0
the 0
years 0
of 0
torture 0
carried 0
out 0
under 0
the 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
White 0
House. 0

A 0
2013 0
Washington 0
Post 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
new 0
CIA 0
head 0
called 1
her 1
role 1
in 1
the 1
torture 1
programs 1
of 1
that 1
era 1
“extensive” 1
and 1
noted 1
that 1
at 1
one 1
point 1
she 1
ran 1
a 1
CIA 1
“black 1
site” 1
in 0
Thailand 0
where 0
torture 0
occurred. 0

In 0
a 0
lengthy 0
statement 0
following 0
Haspel’s 0
nomination, 0
McCain 0
expressed 0
big 0
concerns 0
about 0
what 0
it 0
means 0
for 0
the 0
agency’s 0
future, 0
saying: 0

During 0
his 0
own 0
confirmation 0
proceedings 0
for 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
repeatedly 0
committed 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
comply 0
with 0
the 0
law 0
that 0
applies 0
the 0
Army 0
Field 0
Manual’s 0
interrogation 0
requirements 0
to 0
all 0
U.S. 0
agencies, 0
including 0
the 0
CIA. 0

The 0
American 0
people 0
now 0
deserve 0
the 0
same 0
assurances 0
from 0
Gina 0
Haspel, 0
whose 0
career 0
with 0
the 0
agency 0
has 0
intersected 0
with 0
the 0
program 0
of 0
so-called 0
‘enhanced 0
interrogation 0
techniques’ 0
on 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
occasions. 0

The 0
torture 0
of 0
detainees 0
in 0
U.S. 0
custody 0
during 0
the 0
last 0
decade 0
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
darkest 1
chapters 1
in 1
American 1
history. 1

Ms. 0
Haspel 0
needs 0
to 0
explain 0
the 0
nature 0
and 0
extent 0
of 0
her 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
interrogation 0
program 0
during 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process. 0

I 0
know 0
the 0
Senate 0
will 0
do 0
its 0
job 0
in 0
examining 0
Ms. 0
Haspel’s 0
record 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
her 0
beliefs 0
about 0
torture 0
and 0
her 0
approach 0
to 0
current 0
law. 0

In 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
the 0
September 0
11th 0
attacks, 0
our 0
government 0
squandered 0
precious 0
moral 0
authority 0
in 0
a 0
futile 1
effort 1
to 0
produce 0
intelligence 0
by 0
means 0
of 0
torture. 0

We 0
are 0
still 0
dealing 0
with 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
that 0
desperately 1
misguided 1
decision. 1

Current 0
U.S. 0
law 0
is 0
clear 0
in 0
banning 0
enhanced 0
interrogation 0
techniques. 0

Any 0
nominee 0
for 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
must 0
pledge 0
without 0
reservation 0
to 0
uphold 0
this 0
prohibition, 0
which 0
has 0
helped 0
us 0
to 0
regain 0
our 0
position 0
of 0
leadership 0
in 0
the 0
struggle 0
for 0
universal 0
human 0

struggle 1
upon 1
which 1
this 1
country 1
was 1
founded, 1
and 1
which 1
remains 1
its 1
highest 1
aspiration. 1

Americans 1
who 1

with 1

in 0

site 0
in 0
Nevada 0
from 0
2005 0

for 0
this 0

purpose. 0

MEK 0
is 0
the 0

organization 0
that 0
advocates 0
for 0
the 0
violent 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0

They 0
are 0
hardly 0

about 0

Coincidentally, 0
MEK 0
was 0
classified 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
by 0
the 0
United 0

For 0
over 0
a 0

Bolton 0
has 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
Iran. 0

Now, 0
he’s 0
the 0
National 0
Security 0
Advisor. 0

It 0
just 0
so 0
happens 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
calls 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
in 0
Iran 0
was 0
caught 0
on 0

last 0

as 0
Bolton 0
gave 0
a 0
speech 0
at 0
the 0
Grand 0
Gathering 0
of 0
Iranians 0
for 0
Free 1
Iran. 1

“There 0
is 0
a 0
viable 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
the 0
ayatollahs, 0
and 0
that 0
opposition 0
is 0
centered 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
today. 0

I 0
had 0
said 0
for 0
over 0
10 0
years 0
since 0
coming 0
to 0
these 0
events, 0
that 0
the 0
declared 0
policy 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
should 0
be 0
the 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
mullahs’ 0
regime 0
in 0
Tehran. 0

The 0
behavior 0
and 0
the 0
objectives 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
change, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 0
only 0
solution 0
is 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
regime 0
itself. 0

And 0
that’s 0
why, 0
before 0
2019, 0
we 0
here 0
will 0
celebrate 0
in 0
Tehran!” 0

Pay 0
attention 0
to 0
the 0
first 0
line 0
in 0
that 0
quote 0
above 0
in 0
which 0
Bolton 0
notes 0
that 0
the 0
opposition 0
needed 0
to 0
overthrow 0
Iran’s 0
current 0
regime 0
“is 0
centered 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
today.” 0
Who 1
was 1
in 1
that 1
room? 1

Well, 0
the 0
entire 0
event 0
was 0
actually 0
put 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
People’s 0
Mojahedin 0
Organization 0
of 0
Iran, 0
also 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
Mojahedin-e 0
Khalq 0
or 0
MEK. 0

As 0
Politico 0
pointed 0
out 0
in 0
a 0
2016 0
article, 0
despite 0
the 0
neocon 0
attempts 0
to 0
rewrite 0
history, 0
MEK 0
have 0
killed 0
Americans 0
and 0
committed 0
multiple 0
acts 0
of 0
terrorism. 0

For 0
decades, 0
and 0
based 0
on 0
U.S. 0
intelligence, 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
government 0
has 0
blamed 0
the 0
MEK 0
for 0
killing 0
three 0
U.S. 0
Army 0
colonels 0
and 0
three 0
U.S. 0
contractors, 0
bombing 0
the 0
facilities 0
of 0
numerous 0
U.S. 0
companies 0
and 0
killing 0
innocent 0
Iranians. 0

To 0
recap, 0
the 0
formerly 0
terrorist-classified 0
organization 0
MEK, 0
trained 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
and 0
granted 0
special 0
privilege 0
status 0
by 0
then-Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
in 0
2012—which 0
has 0
since 0
been 0
heavily 0
funded 0
to 0
refine 0
their 0
image 0
by 0
having 0
famous 0
US 0
neoconservative 0
war 0
hawks 0
from 0
both 0
sides 0
of 0
the 0
isle 0
actually 0
chant 0
for 0
“regime 0
change” 0
on 0
their 0
behalf—is 0
now 0
the 0
darling 1
child 1
of 0
the 0
neocon 0
agenda 0
and 0
the 0
impetus 0
behind 0
what 0
could 0
kick 0
of 0
World 0
War 0
3. 0

While 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
is 0
certainly 0
no 0
bastion 0
of 0
freedom, 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
US 0
intervention 0
or 0
a 0
violent 0
revolution 0
would 0
be 0
beneficial 0
for 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
or 0
American 0
citizens 0
is 0
outright 1
insane. 1

To 0
see 0
what 0
US 0
intervention—through 0
military 0
support 0
and 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
opposition 0
groups—does 0
to 0
countries, 0
one 0
need 0
only 0
look 0
at 0
Syria, 0
Iraq, 0
Afghanistan, 0
and 0
Libya 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
horrific 1
death 0
tolls 0
and 0
war-ravaged 1
dystopias 1
left 0
in 0
America’s 0
wake. 0

To 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
over 0
the 0
years, 0
Trump’s 0
desire 0
to 0
intervene 0
in 0
Iran, 0
and 0
his 0
subsequent 0
support 0
in 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
from 0
all 0
sides 0
of 0
the 0
political 0
spectrum 0
should 0
come 0
as 0
no 0
surprise 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
plan 0
since 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
was 0
in 0
office 0
and 0
was 0
documented 0
in 0
the 0
neoconservative 0
PNAC 0
report. 0

This 0
was 0
even 0
admitted 0
by 0
General 0
Wesley 0
Clark, 0
former 0
Supreme 0
Allied 0
Commander 0
of 0
NATO, 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
planned 0
on 0
going 0
to 0
war 0
with 0
Iran, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
2001 0
memo 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
memo 0
that 0
describes 0
how 0
we’re 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
out 0
seven 0
countries 0
in 0
five 0
years,” 0
Clark 0
said. 0

“Starting 0
with 0
Iraq, 0
and 0
then 0
Syria, 0
Lebanon, 0
Libya, 0
Somalia, 0
Sudan, 0
and 0
finishing 0
off 0
with 0
Iran.” 0

All 0
presidents 0
since 0

have 0
crossed 0

off 0

Department 0
of 0
Homeland 0
Security 0
(DHS) 0
declined 0
to 0
enforce 0
those 0
deportation 0
orders, 0
called 0
Final 0
Order 0
Of 0
Removal 0

During 0
the 0
10 0
or 0
so 0
years 0
that 0
the 0
cases 0
involving 0
Indonesian 0
Christians 0
were 0
free 0
to 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
those 0
illegal 0
aliens 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
any 0
effort 0
to 0
appeal 0
their 0
outstanding 0
orders. 0

Then 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
had 0
an 0
election, 0
and 0
the 0
policy 0
of 0
not 0
enforcing 0
those 0
and 0
many 0
other 0
Final 0
Orders 0
of 0
Removal 0
was 0
ended. 0

Then 0
suddenly, 0
those 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
claimed 0
they 0
were 0
being 0
denied 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
file 0
for 0
asylum 0
or 0
were 0
not 0
receiving 0
due 0
process. 0

They 0
filed 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
the 0
Federal 0
courts 0
and 0
were 0
assigned 0
to 0
a 0
Kritarch, 0
Patti 0
Saris, 0
who 1
apparently 1
thinks 1
she 1
runs 1
immigration 1
policy, 1
even 0
after 0
aliens 1
have 0
had 0
their 0
day 0
in 0
court. 0

Saris 1
thinks 1
she 1
can 1
usurp 1
the 1
Constitution 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
based 1
on 1
her 1
whims 1
regarding 1

Patti 0
Saris 0

In 0
her 0
latest 0
excursion 0
into 0

enforcement 0
policy, 0
she 0
decided 0
that 0
illegal 1

can't 0
be 0
held 0

for 0
their 0

BOSTON 0
(Reuters) 0
- 0
A 0
U.S. 0
judge 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
ordered 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
an 0
illegal 0
immigrant 0
who 0
is 0
among 0
47 0
Indonesians 0
in 0
New 0
Hampshire 0
challenging 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
order 0
to 0

them. 0

The 0
man, 0
Terry 0
Rombot, 0
had 0
been 0
allowed 0
to 0
remain 0
under 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
a 0
2010 0
deal 0
with 0
U.S. 0
Immigration 0
and 0
Customs 0
Enforcement 0
until 0
this 0
year, 0
when 0
President 0
Donald 0

instructed 0

that 0
all 0
people 0
living 0
in 0
the 0
United 0

illegally 0
were 0
subject 0
to 0

Held 0
By 0

Order, 0
by 0
Nate 0
Raymond, 0
Reuters, 0
November 0
1, 0
2017] 0

First, 0
let's 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
misleading 0
reporting. 0

Rombot 0
was 0
not 0
taken 0
into 0
custody 0
based 0
on 0
any 0
ICE 0
policy 0
of 0
deporting 0
all 0
illegal 1
aliens. 1

Rombot 0
was 0
taken 0
into 0
custody 0
because 0
he 0
had 0
an 0
outstanding 0
Final 0
Order 0
Of 0
Removal; 0
that's 1
a 1
big 1
difference 1
and 1
symptomatic 1
of 1
the 1
lies 1
from 1
reporters 1
like 1
Raymond. 1

Saris 0
previously 0
ordered 0
a 0
stay 0
to 0
the 0
deportations. 0

She 0
is 0
currently 0
weighing 0
whether 0
she 0
can 0
order 0
a 0
longer 0
delay 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
affected 0
people 0
time 0
to 0
renew 0
their 0
efforts 0
to 0
gain 0
legal 0
status. 0

Now, 0
with 0
regard 0
to 0
Saris, 0
she 0
has 0
no 0
authority 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
the 0
pre-deportation 0
custody 0
of 0
an 0
illegal 1
alien 1
with 0
a 0
Final 0
Order 0
Of 0
Removal. 0

Rombot 0
was 0
taken 0
into 0
custody 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
soon 0
to 0
be 0
deported. 0

There 0
was 0
no 0
issue 0
of 0
Indonesia 0
not 0
accepting 0
him 0
nor 0
of 0
Indonesia 0
not 0
providing 0
a 0
travel 0
document, 0
so 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
question 0
of 0
him 0
being 0
held 0
in 0
custody 0
longer 0
than 0
allowed 0
in 0
the 0
St. 0
Cyr 0
decision 0
that 0
restricted 0
custody 0
of 0
illegal 1
aliens 1
with 0
Final 0
Orders 0
Of 0
Removal 0
who 0
for 0
whatever 0
reason 0
were 0
unlikely 0
to 0
be 0
successfully 0
deported. 0

She 0
still 0
thinks 0
that 0
she 0
can 0
review 0
the 0
underlying 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0
immigration 0
court 0
as 0
well.In 0
fact, 0
Saris' 0
actions 0
appear 0
to 0
more 0
akin 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Mexican 0
kritarch 0
Monica 0
Herranz 0
who 0
aided 0
an 0
illegal 1
alien 1
to 0
escape 0
arrest 0
by 0
ICE 0
when 0
she 0
let 0
that 0
illegal 1
alien 1
leave 0
her 0
courtroom 0
through 0
the 0
exit 0
to 0
her 0
judicial 0
chambers. 0

Saris 0
is 0
clearly 0
scheming 0
to 0
help 0
Rombot 0
escape 0
deportation 0
by 0
disappearing 0
into 0

Mysteriously 1
Vanished 1
Into 1

By 0
now, 0
we 0
have 0
all 0
heard 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Campos. 0

He’s 0
the 0
heroic 0
security 0
guard 0
that 0
allegedly 0
located 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
shooter, 0
Steven 0
Paddock. 0

But 0
the 0
narrative 0
surrounding 0
him 0
has 0
changed 0
wildly 0
since 0
the 0
authorities 0
mentioned 0
him, 0
and 0
now, 0
he’s 0
mysteriously 1
vanished 1
into 1
thin 1
air. 1

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
leads 0
many 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
Campos 0
didn’t 0
even 0
exist, 0
to 0
begin 0
with. 0

His 1
mere 1
existence 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
fabricated 1
by 1
the 1
very 1
authorities 1
who 1
are 1
cramming 1
lies 1
down 1
our 1
throats 1
about 1
this 1
massacre 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
political 1
agendas. 1

There 0
are 0
two 0
conflicting 0
timelines 0
of 0
Campos’s 0
injury, 0
but 0
what 0
the 0
media 0
has 0
so 0
far 0
made 0
clear, 0
is 0
that 0
they 1
want 1
the 1
public 1
to 1
believe 1
Campos 0
was 0
walking 0
down 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Hotel 0
& 0
Casino’s 0
32nd 0
floor 0
hallway, 0
when 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
spotted 0
him 0
on 0
a 0
camera 0
he’d 0
allegedly 0
set 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
room 0
service 0
cart, 0
just 0
outside 0
his 0
suite. 0

Once 0
he 0
saw 0
Campos, 0
Paddock 0
reportedly 0
fired 0
nearly 0
200 0
rounds 0
through 0
his 0
suite 0
door, 0
wounding 0
Campos 0
in 0
the 0
leg. 0

Moments 0
later 0
(6 0
minutes 0
actually, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
newly 0
revised 0
timeline 0
regarding 0
Campos) 0
Paddock 0
allegedly 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
a 0
crowd 0
killing 0
more 0
than 0
50 0
and 0
injuring 0
nearly 0
500. 0

But 0
Campos 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
mysterious 0
subject 0
since 0
being 0
wounded 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
moments 0
of 0
Paddock’s 0
assault. 0

After 0
speaking 0
to 0
hotel 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officials, 0
Campos 0
was 0
scheduled 0
to 0
appear 0
on 0
local 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
television 0
for 0
an 0
interview 0
but 0
went 0
missing 0
just 0
moments 0
before 0
he 0
was 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
on 0
the 0
air. 0

said 0
he 0
got 0
a 0

that 0
Campos 0
had 0
been 0
taken 0
to 0
an 0
urgent 0
care 0
facility, 0
UMC 0

But 0
UMC 0

says 0
none 0
of 0
their 0
clinics 0
filled 0
out 0
an 0
intake 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
patient 0
by 0
that 0
name, 0
and 0
Campos 0
has 0
been 0
silent 0
since 0
the 0
text; 0
vanishing 1
into 1
thin 1
air. 1

He 0
also 0
isn’t 0
listed 0
on 0
the 0
registry 0
that 0
shows 0
the 0
names 0
of 0
licensed 0

“Right 0
now 0
I’m 0
just 0
concerned 0
where 0
my 0
member 0
is, 0
and 0
what 0
his 0
condition 0
is. 0

It’s 0
highly 0
unusual,” 0
Hickey 0
told 0

“I’m 0
hoping 0
everything 0
is 0
OK 0
with 0
him 0
and 0
I’m 0
sure 0
MGM 0

the 0
union 0
will 0
let 0
(media) 0
know 0
when 0

he 0
said. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
authorities 0
still 0
have 0
not 0
released 0
a 0
conclusive 0
timeline 0
for 0
the 0
shooting 0
they 1
desperately 1

us 1
to 1

are 0

TIME 0
ONLINE: 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre’s 0
Prophetic 0
Address 0
to 0
The 0
Remnant, 0
1976 0

On 0
that 0
occasion 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
delivered 0
an 0
address 0
on 0
the 0
desperate 1
state 1
of 0
the 0
Church 0
at 0
that 0
time—42 0
years 0
ago—that 0
was 0
never 0
transcribed 0
or 0
published 0
until 0
we 0
did 0
so 0
for 0
the 0
December 0
15, 0
2017 0
print 0
edition 0
of 0
The 0
Remnant. 0

It 0
was 0
held 0
at 0
the 0
Radisson 0
South 0
Hotel, 0
Minneapolis, 0
on 0
Tuesday, 0
May 0
12, 0
1976, 0
and 0
its 0
stated 0
purpose 0
was 0
to 0
assist 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
in 0
gaining 0
a 0
stronger 0
foothold 0
for 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
St. 0
Pius 0
X 0
in 0
the 0
States 0
during 0
the 0
unprecedented 0
crisis 0
Blessed 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
had 0
helped 0
unleash 0
on 0
the 0
Church. 0

I’m 0
posting 0
the 0
address 0
here 0
because 0
I'm 0
convinced 0
the 0
Archbishop’s 0
words 0
provide 0
recent 0
recruits 0
to 0
Tradition 0
with 0
vital 0
historical 0
context 0
for 0
the 0
diabolical 1
debacle 1
that 0
is 0
the 0
pontificate 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

And 0
for 0
those 0
of 0
us 0
who’ve 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
trenches 0
for 0
a 0
long, 0
long 0
time 0
it 0
also 0
provides 0
welcome 0
reminder 0
of 0
why 0
we 0
must 0
continue 0
to 0
fight. 0

Even 0
though 0
I 0
personally 0
was 0
in 0
attendance 0
back 0
in 0
1976 0
when 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
delivered 0
this 0
address 0
in 0
Minneapolis, 0
I 0
was 0
only 0
ten 0
years 0
old 0
and 0
of 0
course 0
didn't 0
realize 0
how 0
prophetic 0
he 0
was 0
on 0
that 0
occasion, 0
or 0
how 0
devastated 0
by 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
the 0
New 0
Mass, 0
and 0
the 0
Freemasonic 0
infiltration 0
of 0
the 0
Vatican. 0

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
transcript 0
reads 0
like 0
a 0
message 0
of 0
encouragement 0
at 0
a 0
crucial 0
moment 0
in 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
this 0
movement—Stay 0
in 1
the 1
fight! 1

Keep 1
the 1
Faith. 1

Never 1
surrender! 1

This 0
address 0
also 0
makes 0
it 0
absolutely 0
clear 0
that 0
everything 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
did 0
was 0
part 0
of 0
an 0
eleventh-hour 0
defence 0
of 0
the 0
Kingship 0
of 0
Christ 0
(ignored 0
completely 0
by 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council) 0
and 0
a 0
desperate 0
last 0
stand 0
for 0
Tradition, 0
the 1
infallible 1
teachings 1
of 1
Mother 1
Church 1
and 0
of 0
course 0
her 0
ancient 0
liturgy. 0

And 0
now 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
inadvertently 0
unmasked 0
the 0
true 0
spirit 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II, 0
it 0
becomes 0
obvious 0
how 0
and 0
why 0
those 0
who 0
resisted 0
that 0
spirit 0
were 0
right 0
to 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
and 0
will 0
certainly 0
be 0
hailed 0
by 0
history 0
as 0
the 0
heroic 0
band 0
of 0
Catholic 0
brothers 0
that 0
mounted 0
the 0
twentieth 0
century’s 0
last 0
stand 0
for 0
Christ 0
the 0
King 0
and, 0
while 0
scorned 0
and 0
mocked 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
were 0
nevertheless 0
totally 0
vindicated 0
fifty 0
years 0
later. 0

May 0
we 0
continue 0
to 0
earn 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
stand 0
with 0
them 0
today. 0

MJM 0

The 0
Archbishop 0
Speaks 0

Ladies 0
and 0
Gentlemen: 0

As 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
Mr. 0
[Walter] 0
Matt, 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
in 0
bad 0
English 0
what 0
he 0
says 0
in 0
good 0
English, 0
because 0
he 0
said 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
say 0
[Referring 0
here 0
to 0
Walter 0
Matt’s 0
introductory 0
talk 0
referenced 0
above.] 0

And 0
I 0
thank 0
you, 0
Mr. 0
Matt, 0
very 0
much, 0
for 0
his 0
invitation, 0
and 0
I 0
thank 0
you 0
for 0
your 0
coming, 0
and 0
I 0
thank 0
Fr. 0

Ward 0
for 0
what 0
he 0
said 0
about 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
St. 0
Pius 0
X. 0

And 0
I 0
hope 0
that 0
you 0
can 0
understand 0
my 0
poor 0
English, 0
but 0
I 0
think 0
it 0
is 0
better 0
to 0
speak 0
some 0
bad 0
English 0
because 0
to 0
translate 0
would 0
take 0
too 0
much 0
time. 0

As 0
Mr. 0
Matt 0
said, 0
the 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
very 0
extraordinary. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
understand 0
the 0
situation 0
today. 0

My 0
seminary 0
in 0
Econe 0
(in 0
Switzerland) 0
and 0
the 0
seminaries 0
in 0
Germany 0
and 0
here 0
in 0
America, 0
in 0
Armada, 0
are 0
in 0
very 0
difficult 0
situations 0
with 0
Rome. 0

Why? 0

These 0
seminaries 0
are 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
seminaries 0
were 0
before 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

They 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
discipline 0
and 0
the 0
same 0
studies, 0
they 0
make 0
good 0
priests; 0
I 0
think 0
they 0
are 0
good 0
seminarians. 0

All 0
is 0
done 0
as 0
all 0
the 0
seminaries 0
before 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

Why 0
are 0
we 0
now 0
in 0
this 0
very 0
sad 0
situation 0
with 0
Rome? 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
because 0
in 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
Council, 0
there 0
is 0
a 1
mutation, 1
a 1
change, 1
in 1
the 1
Church. 1

But 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
change. 0

We 0
continue 0
the 0
Tradition. 0

So 0
why 0
do 0
they 0
now 0
say, 0
as 0
Mgr. 0

(Archbishop) 0
Benelli[1] 0
said 0
to 0
me 0
months 0
ago 0
on 0
the 0
19th 0
of 0
March, 0
“you 0
are 0
out 0
of 0
communion 0
with 0
the 0
Church.” 0
I 0
am 0
out 0
of 0
communion 0
with 0
the 0
Church 0
because 0
I 0
continue 0
the 0
Tradition 0
of 0
the 0
Church? 0

This 0
is 0
possible? 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
understand. 0

Why? 0

I 0
have 0
done 0
nothing. 0

I 0
believe 0
nothing 0
other 0
than 0
what 0
the 0
Church 0
has 0
believed 0
for 0
twenty 0
centuries. 0

Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
then 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
you 0
must 0
put 0
down 0
in 0
a 0
writing 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
Father 0
that 0
you 0
accept 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council, 0
you 0
accept 0
the 0
reform 0
that 0
followed 0
the 0
Council, 0
and 0
that 0
you 0
accept 0
the 0
orientations 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
given 0
by 0
Rome. 0

Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
took 0
the 0
book 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Ordo, 0
gave 0
it 0
to 0
me, 0
and 0
said, 0
“You 0
must 0
say 0
this 0
New 0
Mass 0
in 0
all 0
of 0
your 0
houses.” 0

I 0
wonder 0
why 0
Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
did 0
not 0
communicate 0
this 0
condition 0
to 0
me 0
before 0
our 0
meeting. 0

[2] 0
He 0
could 0
have 0
done 0
so. 0

For 0
example, 0
one 0
year 0
ago 0
three 0
cardinals 0
sent 0
me 0
a 0
letter 0
(Cardinals 0
Wright, 0
Tabera 0
[Arturo 0
Carinal 0
Tabera 0
Araoz, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
Fathers 0
MJM], 0
and 0
Gabriel-Marie 0
Garrone) 0
telling 0
me 0
(in 0
effect) 0
that 0
I 0
must 0
close 0
the 0
seminaries. 0

Well, 0
I 0
refused, 0
because 0
I 1
refuse 1
to 1
contribute 1
to 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

Because 0
now 0
they 0
are 0
destroying 1
the 1
Church. 1

When 0
I 0
die 0
and 0
go 0
before 0
the 0
judge, 0
God 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
me, 0
“You 1
destroyed 1
the 1
Church.” 1
I 0
refused 0
to 0
contribute 0
to 0
the 0
destruction 1
of 1
the 1
Church. 1

I 0
am 0
sure 0
that 0
my 0
seminaries 0
are 0
contributing 0
to 0
the 0
restoration 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
destroy 0
the 0
Church. 0

And 0
so 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
Mgr. 0

Benelli, 0
“No, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
sign 0
that 0
writing.” 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
the 1
mutation 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
came 0
in 0
through 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

And 0
do 0
you 0
think 0
this 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
came 0
suddenly? 0

When, 0
then? 0

At 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Council? 0

No, 0
this 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
began 0
one 0
century 0
before 0
[the 0
Council]. 0

Pope 0
Pius 0
VI 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
French 0
Revolution 0
that 0
if 1
the 1
Church 1
continues 1
to 1
remain 1
under 1
the 1
influence 1
of 1
the 1
prince 1
of 1
the 1
revolution, 1
then, 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
a 1
crisis 1
will 1
come 1
upon 1
the 1
Church. 1

In 0
[1844], 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
IX 0
ordered 0
Cardinal 0
Rigoli 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
Instructions 0
of 0
the 0
Carbonari. 0

[3] 0
The 0
Pope 0
himself 0
asked 0
Cardinal 0
Rigoli 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
Instructions 0
of 0
the 0
Carbonari. 0

And 0
what 0
did 0
these 0
Instructions 0
say? 0

The 0
Instructions 0
said 0
that 0
they 0
[the 0
Carbonari/Freemasons] 0
must 0
begin 0
to 0
fight 0
against 0
the 0
Church 0
by 0
bringing 0
reform 0
into 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
Instructions 0
said 0
the 0
infiltration 0
will 0
take 0
perhaps 0
not 0
one 0
year, 0
perhaps 0
not 0
ten 0
years, 0
but 0
perhaps 0
a 0
century. 0

The 0
Carbonari 0
must 0
enter 0
into 0
the 0
seminary, 0
into 0
the 0
convent, 0
into 0
the 0
sacristy, 0
and 0
slowly, 0
very 0
slowly, 0
the 0
priests 0
will 0
have 0
the 0
ideals 0
of 0
the 0
revolution; 0
of 0
the 0
Freemasons. 0

One 0
day 0
these 0
priests, 0
imbued 0
with 0
Masonic 0
principles, 0
will 0
become 0
bishops, 0
and 0
these 0
bishops 0
can 0
then 0
choose 0
a 0
pope. 0

And 0
even 0
if 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
Freemason, 0
he 0
will 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
ideals 0
as 0
the 0
Freemasons. 0

Pope 0
Pius 0
IX 0
called 0
for 0
the 0
publishing 0
of 0
these 0
Instructions 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
warn 0
the 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
of 0
those 0
times 0
of 0
the 0
fight 0
against 0
the 0
church. 0

In 0
1895, 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Antonia 0
Fogazzaro, 0
a 0
known 0
modernist, 0
founded 0
a 0
masonic 0
lodge 0
in 0
Milan. 0

He 0
wrote 0
in 0
his 0
book, 0
Il 0
Santo, 0
that 0
“We 0
[modernists]…want 0
a 0
reform 0
in 0
the 0
Church…without 0
rebellion, 0
carried 0
out 0
by 0
legitimate 0
authority…even 0
if 0
this 0
takes 0
20, 0
30, 0
or 0
50 0
years.”[4] 0
“The 0
reform 0
will 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
brought 0
about 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
obedience.” 0
The 0
modernist 0
ideas 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
introduced 0
and 0
enacted 0
through 0
obedience! 0

And 0
I 0
think…well, 0
here 0
we 0
are! 0

In 0
this 0
time! 0

The 0
reform 0
is 0
here, 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
brought 0
about 0
through 0
obedience, 0
to 0
the 0
Council, 0
to 0
the 0
bishop, 0
to 0
the 0
priest. 0

And 0
all 0
they 0
say 0
is 0
“Obedience, 0
obedience, 0
obedience.” 0

The 0
Instructions 0
of 0
the 0
Carbonari 0
say 0
the 0
bishop 0
and 0
the 0
priest 0
will 0
think 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
following 0
the 0
tiara 0
of 0
the 0
Pope, 0
but 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
following 0
the 0
flag 0
of 0
Freemasonry 0
[“the 0
banner 0
of 0
revolution”]. 0

They 1
said 1
that. 1

They 1
wrote 1
that! 1

One 0
century 0
before 0
[the 0
Council]! 0

Thus, 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
they 0
prepared 0
for 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
for 0
a 0
century, 0
perhaps 0
two 0
centuries! 0

As 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Dakar 0
and 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Commission 0
for 0
French-speaking 0
West 0
Africa, 0
I 0
was 0
appointed 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Central 0
Preparatory 0
Commission 0
of 0
the 0
Second 0
Vatican 0
Council. 0

There 0
were 0
some 0
seventy 0
cardinals, 0
twenty 0
bishops, 0
and 0
four 0
super-authorities 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
orders, 0
among 0
others. 0

Before 0
the 0
last 0
meeting 0
of 0
this 0
Commission 0
the 0
members 0
received 0
two 0
schemas 0
on 0
the 0
same 0
subject: 0
one 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani 0
and 0
another 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Bea. 0

The 0
schema 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani 0
was 0
titled 0
“…On 0
Religious 0
Tolerance” 0
and 0
the 0
other, 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
Bea, 0
was 0
titled 0
“On 0
Religious 0
Freedom 0
[Liberty].” 0
When 0
we 0
read 0
these 0
two 0
schemas, 0
we 0
thought, 0
“This 0
is 0
impossible. 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
we 0
can 0
receive 0
two 0
opposing 0
theses? 0

One 0
says 0
we 0
must 0
not 0
tolerate 0
error. 0

The 0
other 0
says 0
that 0
error 0
has 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
exist 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
dignity 0
of 0
the 0
human 0
person.” 0
And 0
so, 0
we 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
meeting. 0

Cardinal 0
Ottaviani, 0
standing, 0
says 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Bea, 0
“You 1
have 1
no 1
authority 1
to 1
compose 1
this 1
schema, 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
theological 1
thesis 1
and 1
therefore 1
within 1
the 1
competence 1
of 1
the 1
Theological 1
Commission.” 1
As 0
Cardinal 0
Bea 0
stands 0
up, 0
he 0
says, 0
“I 0
do 1
have 1
the 1
right 1
to 1
compose 1
this 1
schema 1
because 1
if 1
anything 1
concerns 1
Christian 1
Unity 1
it 1
is 1
religious 1
liberty, 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
the 1
President 1
of 1
the 1
Secretariat 1
for 1
Promoting 1
Christian 1
Unity.” 1
Cardinal 0
Bea, 0
addressing 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani, 0
further 0
said, 0
“I 0
am 0
opposed 0
to 0
your 0
schema.” 0

Impossible! 1

We 1
were 1
in 1
a 1
very 1
sad, 1
serious 1
situation. 1

Cardinal 0
Ruffini 0
had 0
to 0
intervene 0
as 0
we 0
were 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
two 0
cardinals, 0
our 0
brothers. 0

He 0
said 0
we 0
must 0
wait 0
for 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
say 0
who 0
is 0
right 0
and 0
who 0
is 0
wrong. 0

But 0
before 0
the 0
Pope 0
came 0
(because 0
the 0
Pope 0
came 0
many 0
times 0
to 0
present 0
at 0
these 0
meetings) 0
we 0
voted 0
on 0
the 0
schema. 0

Who 0
is 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Ottaviani? 0

Who 0
is 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Bea? 0

The 0
conservatives 0
and 0
the 0
liberals. 0

As 0
the 0
last 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Preparatory 0
Commission, 0
it 0
was 0
for 0
me 0
the 0
first 0
image 0
of 0
the 0
future 0
Council. 0

This 0
historic 0
address 0
appeared 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
ever 0
in 0
a 0
print 0
edition 0
of 0
The 0
Remnant 0
last 0
year. 0

Isn't 0
it 0
time 0
for 0
you 0
to 0
subscribe? 0

And 0
as 0
we 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
Council, 0
you 0
know 0
that 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
Council, 0
Cardinal 0
Lienart 0
was 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
the 0
liberal 0
cardinals 0
in 0
the 0
Council, 0
[together] 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
Cardinals 0
of 0
the 0
Rhine 0
(such 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
Alfrink, 0
Cardinal 0
Frings, 0
Cardinal 0
Dopfner, 0
Cardinal 0
Suenens, 0
Cardinal 0
Leinart, 0
and 0
Cardinal 0
Koenig 0
of 0
Austria). 0

And 0
now 0
one 0
month 0
ago 0
in 0
Rome, 0
the 0
traditional 0
periodical 0
Chiesa 0
Viva 0
published 0
a 0
photo 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Lienart 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
appurtenances 0
of 0
Freemasonry, 1
the 0
date 0
of 0
his 0
inscription 0
in 0
Masonry, 0
the 0
date 0
[of 0
his 0
rising 0
to] 0
the 0
20th 0
Degree 0
of 0
Freemasonry, 1
the 0
date 0
[of 0
his 0
rising 0
to] 0
the 0
30th 0
Degree 0
of 0
Freemasonry, 1
and 0
the 0
places 0
where 0
he 0
[attended] 0
the 0
meetings 0
of 0
Freemasonry. 1

This 0
Cardinal 0
was 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
the 0
liberals 0
in 0
the 0
Council. 0

That 0
is 0
my 0
cardinal; 0
he 0
ordained 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood, 0
and 0
he 0
consecrated 0
me 0
a 0
bishop. 0

And 0
now 0
this 0
is 0
public. 0

Nobody 0
has 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
refute 0
the 0
publication. 0

And 0
so, 0
we 0
have 0
(I 0
am 0
confident) 0
a 1
mutation 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
by 0
the 0
Council 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
reform 0
after 0
the 0
Council. 0

Now, 0
some 0
say 0
the 0
Council 0
is 0
(was) 0
good, 0
but 0
only 0
the 0
reforms 0
were 0
bad. 0

That 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

Why? 0

Because 0
when 0
the 0
reforms 0
come, 0
Rome 0
always 0
says 0
the 0
reforms 0
are 0
being 0
done 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Council. 0

In 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Council! 1

It 0
is 0
evident 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
reforms 0
came 0
from 0
the 0
Council. 0

And 0
if 1
the 1
reforms 1
are 1
bad, 1
then 1
it 1
is 1
impossible 1
that 1
the 1
Council 1
is 1
good 1
and 1
all 1
the 1
reforms 1
are 1
bad, 1
because 1
that 1
is 1
the 1
authentic 1
interpretation 1
of 1
the 1
Council 1
by 1
Rome. 1

Rome 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Declaration 0
of 0
Liturgy, 0
we 0
[implement] 0
the 0
liturgical 0
reform. 0

We 0
can 0
say 0
that 0
[these 0
bad 0
changes 0
are] 0
not 0
in 0
the 0
text 0
of 0
the 0
Declaration, 0
but 0
this 0
man 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
from 0
the 0
Council. 0

They 0
know 0
that. 0

And 0
I 0
am 0
sure 0
that 0
it 0
[the 0
mutation] 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
Council. 0

Even 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
explicitly 0
[stated] 0
in 0
the 0
Council 0
but 0
[rather] 0
in 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
the 0
Council, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same! 0

For 0
example, 0
with 0
religious 0
freedom: 0
now 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
Nuncios 0
are 0
against 0
the 0
Catholic 0
State 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
- 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Declaration 0
of 0
Religious 0
Freedom. 0

I 0
have 0
heard 0
this 0
(personally) 0
twice. 0

The 0
first 0
time 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Columbia. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Columbia, 0
I 0
read 0
in 0
the 0
paper 0
about 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
article 0
of 0
the 0
Constitution 0
of 0
the 0
Republic 0
of 0
Columbia. 0

[The 0
first 0
article] 0
stated 0
that 0
only 0
the 0
Republic 0
of 0
Columbia 0
recognizes 0
only 0
the 0
Catholic 0
religion. 0

They 0
changed 0
it. 0

They 0
removed 0
this 0
article. 0

I 0
read 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
Columbia 0
with 0
the 0
Nuncios 0
of 0
Columbia 0
and 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference 0
in 0
Columbia. 0

The 0
President 0
said 0
he 0
is 0
very, 1
very 1
anxious. 1

He 0
said 0
to 0
the 0
people, 0
“even 0
though 0
we 0
remove 0
this 0
article 0
we 0
remain 0
Catholic. 0

I 0
am 0
a 0
Catholic, 0
I 0
shall 0
remain 0
Catholic, 0
and 0
I 1
do 1
everything 1
possible 1
for 1
the 1
Council 1
and 1
the 1
Catholics 1
in 1
our 1
country.” 1

Then, 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
was 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
a 0
Freemason: 0
all 0
of 0
it 0
was 0
“progress,” 0
“humanity,” 0
“evolution,” 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
hubris 0
of 0
a 0
Freemason. 0

And 0
during 0
the 0
discourse 0
of 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference, 0
[the 0
Secretary] 0
said, 0
“in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Declaration 1
of 1
Religious 1
Freedom 1
[of 1
Vatican 1
II], 1
we 1
ask 1
the 1
President 1
to 1
remove 1
this 1
article 1
in 1
the 1
Constitution.” 1

I 0
met 0
this 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference 0
during 0
my 0
visit 0
in 0
Columbia, 0
and 0
he 0
said 0
for 0
two 0
years 0
they 0
[had 0
been 0
asking] 0
the 0
President, 0
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Holy 1
See, 1
to 0
change 0
this 0
article 0
in 0
their 0
Constitution. 0

But 0
I 0
will 0
never…I 0
do 0
not 0
accept 0
the 0
concept, 0
because 0
you 0
destroy 0
the 0
Catholic 0
State 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Council. 0

Are 0
you 0
sure? 0

Yes, 0
sure. 0

It 0
is 0
evident. 0

Now 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
the 0
[Secretary], 0
“As 0
I 0
speak 0
with 0
you 0
now 0
about 0
Columbia, 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
the 0
one 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
constitution 0
of 0
Valais 0
in 0
Switzerland 0
one 0
year 0
ago. 0

The 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Constitution 0
of 0
Valais 0
was 0
the 0
same.” 0
(Because 0
you 0
know 0
Switzerland 0
is 0
a 0
Federation 0
where 0
some 0
states 0
are 0
Protestant 0
and 0
some 0
states 0
are 0
Catholic. 0

The 0
Valais 0
is 0
Catholic. 0

And 0
in 0
its 0
constitution, 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
article 0
[of 0
the 0
constitution] 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
of 0
Valais 0
– 0
Econe, 0
where 0
we 0
are 0
located, 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
State 0
of 0
Valais 0
- 0
only 0
one 0
religion 0
is 0
recognized: 0
The 0
Catholic 0
Church.) 0

And 0
[the 0
Secretary] 0
said, 0
“Yes, 0
I 0
am 0
responsible 0
for 0
this 0
change.” 0
Brother, 0
what 0
did 0
you 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
Social 0
Kingship 0
of 0
Christ? 0

What 0
is 0
this 0
for 0
you? 0

What 0
do 0
you 0
say 0
when 0
you 0
say 0
“thy 0
kingdom 0
come” 0
in 0
your 0
prayer, 0
the 0
Our 0
Father? 0

“Ah,” 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
“Now 0
it 0
is 0
impossible.” 0
What 0
did 0
you 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
encyclical 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XI, 0
Quas 0
Primas? 0

“Ah, 0
but 0
now 0
the 0
Pope 0
cannot 0
write 0
an 0
encyclical 0
like 0
Quas 0
Primas.” 0

It 0
is 0
incredible. 0

And 0
all 0
in 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
Council. 1

We 1
must 1
take 1
care, 1
because 1
this 1
change 1
in 1
the 1
church 1
is 1
a 1
liberal 1
change. 1

The 1
liberal 1
principles 1
have 1
entered 1
the 1
Church 1
now, 1
and 1
they 1
destroy 1
the 1
Church. 1

If 0
we 0
cannot 0
set 0
out 0
the 0
true 0
principles 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
if 0
we 0
in 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
religious 0
freedom 0
said 0
that 0
all 0
religions 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
right 0
in 0
every 0
state 0
in 0
the 0
world… 0

[missing 0
audio...] 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
King 0
of 0
the 0
World 0
is 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

We 0
say 0
in 0
the 0
Gloria 0
in 0
Excelsis 0
Deo, 0
“Tu 0
solus 0
Altissimus,” 0
“Tu 0
solus 0
Dominus,” 0
“You 0
alone 0
are 0
the 0
Highest,” 0
“You 0
alone 0
are 0
the 0
Lord.” 0
But 0
practically, 0
we 0
would 0
refuse 0
this 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
if 0
we 0
said 0
that 0
Luther, 0
Mohammed, 0
Buddha 0
and 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
are 0
all 0
the 0
same. 0

We 0
cannot 0
say 0
that. 0

Impossible. 1

We 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
many 0
states 0
(it 0
is 0
a 0
pity) 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
[to 0
recognize 0
Catholicism 0
as 0
the 0
state 0
religion]. 0

We 1
must 1
tolerate 1
- 1
have 1
tolerance 1
for 1
the 1
error 1
- 1
but 1
never 1
give 1
the 1
same 1
right 1
to 1
error 1
and 1
truth. 1

That 1
is 1
impossible. 1

And 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
liturgy 0
is 0
very 0
important. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
bad. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
principles 0
of 0
modern 0
man, 0
as 0
they 0
say 0
now, 0
“modern 0
man,” 0
is 0
democracy. 0

And 0
democracy 0
can 0
have 0
a 0
good 0
sense 0
but 0
not 0
if 0
[by 0
that 0
term 0
is 0
meant] 0
that 0
those 0
who 0
govern 0
receive 0
their 0
authority 0
from 0
the 0
people. 0

The 1
authority 1
comes 1
from 1
God. 1

Not 1
from 1
the 1
people. 1

Not 1
from 1
the 1
masses. 1

From 1
God. 1

But 0
today 0
the 0
principle, 0
the 0
democratic 1
principle, 1
is 0
that 0
the 0
authority 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
people. 0

It 0
is 0
in 1
the 1
masses. 1

That 0
is 0
not 0
true. 0

It 0
is 0
impossible. 0

And 0
our 0
liturgy 0
is 0
the 0
school 0
of 0
our 0
Faith. 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
school 0
of 0
our 0
Faith 0
for 0
all 0
people. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
Africa 0
as 0
a 0
missionary 0
and 0
as 0
bishop 0
for 0
30 0
years. 0

I 0
know 0
the 0
liturgy 0
was 0
the 0
best 0
school 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
for 0
people 0
who 0
cannot 0
read. 0

They 0
can 0
see 0
what 0
the 0
priest 0
does. 0

They 0
can 0
see 0
what 0
the 0
priest 0
does 0
at 0
the 0
adoration 0
of 0
the 0
Body 0
and 0
the 0
Blood 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

And 0
they 0
know 0
that 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
is 0
present 0
- 0
His 0
real 0
presence 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
altar 0
- 0
by 0
the 0
attitude 0
of 0
the 0
priest. 0

They 0
know 0
that. 0

That 0
is 0
very 0
important. 0

But 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
the 0
Mass 0
destroys 1
the 1
Church. 1

Because 0
we 0
know 0
the 0
liturgy 0
teaches 0
us 0
hierarchy. 0

The 0
true 0
liturgy 0
is 0
hierarchical. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
democratic 0
but 0
hierarchical. 1

Why? 0

Because 0
we 0
have 0
God, 0
the 0
priest, 0
and 0
then 0
the 0
people. 0

That 0
is 0
hierarchy. 0

When 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
Church 0
we 0
know 0
God 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
altar; 0
the 0
priest 0
is 0
between 0
God 0
and 0
the 0
people; 0
and 0
the 0
people 0
receive 0
God 0
at 0
the 0
hand 0
of 0
the 0
priest. 0

That 1
is 1
hierarchy. 1

But 0
now 0
the 0
new 0
liturgy 0
is 0
more 0
democratic 0
- 0
all 0
around 0
the 0
table. 0

The 0
priest 0
is 0
only 0
the 0
president, 0
and 0
sometimes 0
another 0
man 0
can 0
take 0
the 0
role 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
meal. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
liturgy. 0

That 0
is 0
very 0
bad, 0
because 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
sense 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchical; 0
whereas 0
the 0
sense 0
of 0
hierarchy 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
in 0
our 0
life. 0

We 0
need 0
the 0
authority 0
of 0
God. 0

We 0
need 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence 0
of 0
God 0
on 0
our 0
altar. 0

We 0
need 0
the 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass 0
– 0
not 0
a 0
meal 0
only 0
– 0
but 0
the 0
Sacrifice. 0

So, 0
the 0
Victim 0
of 0
the 0
Sacrifice 0
is 0
really 0
present 0
on 0
our 0
altar. 0

That 0
is 0
the 0
school 0
of 0
our 0
Faith. 0

And 0
slowly, 0
slowly, 0
this 0
new 0
Mass 0
equivocates. 0

It 0
moves 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
in 0
a 0
Protestant 0
[direction]. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
say 0
that 0
all 0
[Novus 0
Ordo] 0
Masses 0
are 0
invalid. 0

I 1
do 1
not 1
say 1
that. 1

But 0
perhaps, 0
more 0
and 0
more, 0
they 0
become 0
invalid 0
because 0
[the 0
ministers 0
lose 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence]. 0

Recently, 0
in 0
France, 0
a 0
progressive 0
paper 0
conducted 0
a 0
statistical 0
survey 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
many 0
priests 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence. 0

They 0
found 0
that 0
twenty-two 0
percent 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
the 0
faith, 0
the 1
belief 1
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence. 0

But 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
directed 0
this 0
question 0
to 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
priests 0
who 0
are 0
under 0
50 0
years 0
of 0
age, 0
they 0
would 0
find 0
that 0
fifty 0
percent 0
[have 0
lost 0
the 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence], 0
because 0
the 0
young 0
priests 0
have 0
no 0
faith. 0

No 1
faith. 1

Last 0
year, 0
Bishop 0
Adam 0
(in 0
our 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Sion, 0
Switzerland) 0
ordained 0
one 0
priest 0
for 0
my 0
Congregation 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
Ghost 0
Fathers. 0

This 0
one 0
priest 0
came 0
from 0
France. 0

His 0
uncle 0
had 0
died 0
in 0
a 0
road 0
accident 0
when 0
his 0
cab 0
fell 0
in 0
the 0
river. 0

The 0
uncle 0
had 0
nine 0
children. 0

The 0
Bishop 0
said 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
priest, 0
“Now 0
you 0
can 0
say 0
Mass 0
for 0
your 0
uncle. 0

Now 0
you 0
are 0
a 0
priest, 0
and 0
you 0
can 0
say 0
Mass 0
for 0
your 0
uncle.” 0
The 0
new 0
priest 0
said, 0
“No, 0
never.” 0
Why? 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
useful 0
to 0
say 0
Mass 0
for 0
the 0
dead? 0

“No, 0
no, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible. 0

They 0
are 0
already 0
in 0
heaven.” 0
This 0
young 0
priest 0
who 0
was 0
ordained 0
by 0
the 0
Bishop 0
last 0
year 0
for 0
my 0
Congregation 0
is 0
now 0
a 0
professor 0
in 0
the 0
minor 0
seminary 0
in 0
Switzerland. 0

They 0
are 0
not 0
learning 0
theology, 0
not 0
philosophy, 0
not 0
anything. 0

They 1
learn 1
nothing 1
now. 1

Another 0
example. 0

Recently, 0
I 0
had 0
two 0
young 0
[potential] 0
seminarians 0
come 0
to 0
my 0
house 0
near 0
Paris. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
works 0
in 0
a 0
factory, 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
is 0
a 0
university 0
student. 0

They 0
told 0
me 0
they 0
were 0
[considering] 0
the 0
seminary 0
of 0
Paris. 0

I 0
asked 0
them, 0
“Why 0
do 0
you 0
come 0
to 0
see 0
me?” 0
They 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
meeting 0
in 0
the 0
house 0
of 0
the 0
Oblate 0
of 0
Maria 0
with 0
the 0
priest 0
who 0
oversees 0
young 0
men 0
who 0
may 0
have 0
vocations 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
in 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Paris. 0

There 0
was 0
a 0
total 0
of 0
fifteen 0
young 0
men 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
Paris. 0

During 0
the 0
meeting, 0
the 0
priest, 0
before 0
he 0
celebrated 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
said, 0
“Today 0
we 0
celebrate 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
but 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence.” 0
These 0
two 0
young 0
men 0
said 0
“That 0
is 0
impossible. 1

We 0
cannot 0
remain 0
in 0
this 0
seminary.” 0
So, 0
they 0
came 0
to 0
meet 0
me. 0

They 0
said 0
that 0
Econe 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
seminary 0
where 0
they 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
True 0
Faith. 0

They 0
asked 0
for 0
admittance 0
to 0
Econe. 0

And 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
they 0
shall 0
be 0
coming 0
to 0
Econe 0
next 0
October. 0

But 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
religion. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
Protestant 0
religion. 0

That 1
is 1
a 1
fact. 1

Perhaps 0
you 0
can 0
say, 0
“How 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
that 1
the 1
pope 1
gives 1
the 1
authorization 1
to 1
this 1
change? 1

How 1
is 1
it 1
possible 1
the 1
pope 1
signed 1
this 1
decree? 1

Signed 1
this 1
constitution?” 1
I 0
don’t 0
know. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know. 1

It 0
is 0
a 0
big 0
mystery. 0

A 1
big 1
mystery. 1

There 0
are 0
many 0
proposed 0
theological 0
answers. 0

I 0
cannot 0
subscribe 0
to 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

Some 0
say 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
not 0
responsible. 0

Perhaps 0
someone 0
gave 0
the 0
pope 0
an 0
injection, 0
a 0
drug, 0
and 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
responsible. 0

Perhaps, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know. 0

Some 0
say 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
popes 0
[(a 0
body 0
double)]. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know. 1

Some 0
say 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
liberal 0
before 0
he 0
was 0
elected 0
pope, 0
and 0
perhaps 0
(we 0
do 0
not 0
know) 0
he 0
gave 0
his 0
name 0
to 0
Freemasonry 0
(thereby 0
incurring 0
excommunication 0
before 0
the 0
conclave). 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
know. 0

We 0
do 0
know 0
now 0
that 0
Bugnini 0
was 0
primarily 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
change 0
in 0
liturgy, 0
and 0
that 0
he 1
is 1
an 1
infamous 1
Freemason. 1

And 0
because 0
he 0
had 0
an 0
indiscretion 0
with 0
his 0
Masonic 0
appurtenances, 0
the 0
Pope 0
sent 0
him 0
as 0
a 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Iran. 0

I 1
don’t 1
know. 1

We 1
don’t 1
know. 1

Now, 0
you 0
cannot 0
say 0
that 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre 0
said 0
the 0
pope 0
gave 0
his 0
name 0
to 0
Freemasonry. 0

No, 0
you 0
cannot 0
say 0
that. 0

It 0
is 0
possible, 0
but 0
we 1
do 1
not 1
know. 1

But 0
if 0
he 0
was 0
excommunicated, 0
then 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
pope. 0

Not 1
pope. 1

Illegitimate. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
mystery 0
I 0
cannot 0
understand. 0

But 0
the 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
is 0
being 0
destroyed, 0
and 0
now 0
even 0
the 0
pope 0
himself 0
says 0
that. 0

This 0
pope 0
has 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
auto-demolition 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

He 0
said, 0
“The 0
smoke 1
of 1
Satan 1
has 0
entered 0
the 0
Church.” 0
But 0
where 0
are 0
the 0
men 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
Church? 0

Well, 0
there 0
they 0
are. 0

They 0
are 0
the 0
men 0
who 0
destroy 0
the 0
Church. 0

We 0
must 0
show 0
where 0
they 0
are. 0

Where 0
is 0
this 0
smoke 1
of 1
Satan 1
that 0
has 0
entered 0
the 0
Church? 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
know, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
pope 0
himself 0
who 0
said 0
that. 0

And 0
I 0
have 0
these 0
experiences 0
every 0
day. 0

I 0
visit 0
many 0
countries. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
Spain 0
during 0
the 0
Christmas 0
Holy 0
Days. 0

Then 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Bonn, 0
near 0
Cologne, 0
Germany, 0
three 0
weeks 0
ago, 0
to 0
speak 0
at 0
a 0
conference. 0

Many 0
people 0
came. 0

Many 0
people 0
are 0
confused. 0

What 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
the 0
Church? 0

They 0
are 0
anxious. 0

But 0
many 0
people 0
say 0
that 0
we 0
disobey. 0

Disobey? 0

Obedience 0
is 0
relative. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
absolute. 0

It 0
is 0
relative 0
to 0
the 0
good, 0
but 0
not 0
to 0
the 0
evil. 0

We 0
cannot 0
obey 0
our 0
parents 0
if 0
they 0
command 0
a 0
bad 0
thing. 0

We 0
cannot 0
obey. 0

It 0
is 0
clear. 0

And 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
in 0
Spain, 0
for 0
example, 0
the 0
situation 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
very 0
bad. 0

The 0
new 0
nominees 0
of 0
bishops 0
and 0
many 0
auxiliary 0
bishops 0
are, 0
approximately, 0
communist, 0
Marxist, 0
and 0
socialist. 0

And 0
so, 0
a 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
in 0
the 0
Episcopal 0
Conference 0
of 0
Spain 0
are 0
progressives. 0

They 0
are 0
modernists. 0

Whereas, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
[from 0
Spain] 0
during 0
the 0
Council 0
were 0
conservative. 0

So, 0
Rome 0
is 0
responsible 0
[for 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Spain] 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
Rome 0
who 0
approves 0
the 0
nominations 0
for 0
bishops. 0

And 0
we 0
know 0
in 0
France, 0
in 0
Germany, 0
and 0
in 0
Europe 0
generally, 0
that 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
young 0
bishops 0
are 0
worse 0
[than 0
the 0
bishops 0
in 0
Spain] 0
in 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
Marxist. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

That 0
is 0
impossible. 0

How 0
can 0
they 0
do 0
that? 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
know. 0

I 1
do 1
not 1
know. 1

I 0
have 0
not 0
spent 0
my 0
whole 0
life 0
in 0
Rome. 0

I 0
do 0
know 0
Rome 0
very 0
well, 0
because 0
I 0
was 0
an 0
apostolic 0
delegate, 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
Secretariate 0
of 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

And 0
I 0
know 0
that 0
very 0
well. 0

But 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
the 1
devil 1
is 1
in 1
Rome, 1
as 0
was 0
said 0
by 0
our 0
Lady 0
of 0
Fatima 0
and 0
Our 0
Lady 0
of 0
La 0
Salette. 0

We 0
must 0
pray. 0

We 0
must 0
ask 0
God 0
to 0
put 0
an 0
end 0
to 0
this 0
crisis 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

Because 1
if 1
this 1
crisis 1
continues, 1
many 1
people 1
will 1
go 1
to 1
hell. 1

They 0
lose 0
the 0
faith. 0

They 0
cannot 0
go 0
into 0
the 0
church. 0

They 0
abandon 0
the 0
faith. 0

You 0
know 0
that 0
many 0
priests 0
have 0
abandoned 0
the 0
faith. 0

Many 0
priests 0
have 0
gotten 0
married. 0

And 0
many 0
sisters 0
have 0
abandoned 0
their 0
congregations. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
pity. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
everywhere. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
Melbourne, 0
Australia, 0
during 0
the 0
40th 0
International 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress. 0

Cardinal 0
Knox, 0
who 0
was 0
the 0
man 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress, 0
is 0
now 0
the 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Divine 0
Worship. 0

I 0
read 0
in 0
the 0
newspaper 0
about 0
a 0
Mass 0
Cardinal 0
Knox 0
celebrated 0
during 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress 0
where 0
sensual 1
dancing 1
was 0
performed 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
the 0
Consecration 0
were 0
pronounced. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
sacrilege. 1

You 0
cannot 0
go 0
to 0
that 0
Mass. 0

That 1
is 1
sacrilege. 1

This 0
is 0
a 0
fact. 0

They 0
also 0
called 0
me 0
by 0
phone 0
in 0
Melbourne 0
to 0
say 0
I 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
[attending] 0
the 0
Eucharistic 0
Congress. 0

They 0
asked 0
me 0
to 0
concelebrate 0
Mass 0
with 0
a 0
Protestant 0
pastor 0
and 0
a 0
rabbi. 0

Ay. 1

Impossible. 1

Impossible. 1

No, 1
no, 1
no, 1
no. 1

[applause] 0

This 0
change 0
is 0
not 0
accidental. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
superficial. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
deep. 0

Very 0
bad. 0

It 0
is 0
against 0
our 0
faith. 0

Against 1
our 1
faith. 1

And 0
so, 0
we 0
cannot 0
accept 0
this 0
Council 0
and 0
this 0
reform 0
and 0
this 0
orientation 0
even 0
though 0
it 0
comes 0
from 0
Rome. 0

From 0
Rome 0
we 0
expect 0
only 0
the 0
good. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
expect 0
the 0
bad, 0
the 0
ill. 0
We 0
do 0
not 0
expect 0
the 0
abandonment 0
of 0
adoration 0
in 0
the 0
Mass. 0

We 0
need 0
this 0
adoration. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
faith 0
in 0
the 0
divinity 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

Because 0
all 0
[of 0
this 0
change] 0
is 0
[oriented] 0
against 0
the 0
divinity 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ, 0
against 0
the 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ, 0
against 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
in 0
the 0
Mass. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
sin 0
when 0
we 0
abandon 0
the 0
truth 0
of 0
the 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ, 0
everywhere, 0
and 0
we 0
abandon 0
the 0
Faith 0
of 0
the 0
divinity 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ. 0

He 0
is 0
King 0
because 0
he 0
is 0
God. 0

He 0
is 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
God. 0

So, 0
He 0
is 0
King 0
by 0
His 0
nature. 0

This 0
is 0
essential. 0

Essential! 1

And 1
if 1
He 1
is 1
God, 1
we 1
must 1
give 1
Him 1
the 1
adoration 1
of 1
God. 1

And 0
so, 0
we 0
cannot 0
accept 0
the 0
diminution 0
of 0
this 0
Truth. 0

Jesus 0
Christ 0
is 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
God. 0

Jesus 0
Christ 0
is 0
God. 0

That 0
is 0
a 0
fundamental 0
truth 0
of 0
our 0
Faith. 0

And 0
it 0
all 0
depends 0
on 0
this 0
Truth. 0

And 0
we 0
know 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
theologians 0
and 0
the 0
bishops 0
have 0
[a 0
new 0
orientation]. 0

They 0
do 0
not 0
express 0
this 0
truth 0
clearly 0
and 0
perfectly. 0

They 0
are 0
afraid 0
of 0
the 0
truth. 0

That 0
is 0
very 0
bad. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
in 0
Rome. 0

I 0
think 0
they 0
refuse 0
[to 0
grant 0
me 0
an 0
audience 0
with] 0
the 0
pope, 0
[because 0
they 0
are 0
afraid 0
of 0
the 0
Truth]. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Rome 0
one 0
month 0
ago, 0
Mgr. 0

Benelli 0
told 0
me 0
he 0
visits 0
the 0
pope 0
every 0
day. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
when 0
he 0
left 0
me, 0
he 0
would 0
go 0
immediately 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
to 0
express 0
the 0
importance 0
of 0
the 0
work 0
we 0
had 0
conducted 0
during 0
our 0
meeting. 0

Immediately, 0
he 0
said, 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
going. 0

So, 0
why 0
do 0
they 0
not 0
grant 0
me 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
visiting 0
the 0
pope? 0

Because 0
they 0
are 0
afraid. 0

Meanwhile 0
the 0
Vatican 0
operated 0
a 0
veritable 0
swinging 0
door 0
where 0
actual 0
heretics 0
and 0
schismatics 0
were 0
concerned. 0

Here, 0
again, 0
is 0
Blessed 0
Paul 0
VI, 0
famously 0
meeting 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
ever 0
with 0
the 0
heretic 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Canterbury 0
in 0
St. 0
Peter's: 0

Cardinal 0
Villot 0
said, 0
“We 0
are 0
afraid 0
if 0
Msgr. 0

Lefebvre 0
meets 0
and 0
speaks 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
that 0
perhaps 0
the 0
pope 0
will 0
change 0
his 0
mind.” 0
Because 0
[the 0
pope] 0
is 0
not 0
too 0
sure; 0
the 1
pope 1
is 1
not 1
man 1
of 1
true 1
conviction. 1

He 0
is 0
a 0
mysterious 0
man. 0

We 0
cannot 0
give 0
a 0
definition 0
of 0
the 0
man. 0

He 0
expresses 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
then 0
he 0
does 0
the 0
contrary/opposite. 0

Some 0
part 0
of 0
him 0
will 0
speak 0
the 0
truth. 0

Another 0
part 0
of 0
him 0
is 0
open 0
to 0
error. 0

Very 0
curious. 0

And 0
they 0
are 0
afraid 0
that 0
if 0
I 0
reveal 0
the 0
truth 0
[and 0
tell 0
the 0
Pope] 0
“you 0
must 0
affirm 0
the 0
Kingdom 0
of 0
Jesus 0
Christ 0
everywhere 0
and 0
always 0
each 0
day. 0

You 0
must 0
affirm 0
the 0
Real 0
Presence 0
in 0
the 0
Mass 0
- 0
in 0
the 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass,” 0
then 0
perhaps 0
it 0
is 0
possible 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
will 0
change 0
his 0
mind. 0

And 0
so, 0
Cardinal 0
Villot 0
says, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
confusion, 0
and 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
me 0
to 0
visit 0
the 0
pope. 0

It 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
admit 0
me. 0

And 0
I 0
know 0
the 0
pope 0
very 0
well! 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
the 0
apostolic 0
delegate 0
to 0
Pius 0
XII, 0
I 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
Rome 0
every 0
year. 0

And 0
during 0
those 0
eleven 0
years, 0
I 0
met 0
Msgr. 0

Montini. 0

I 1
know 1
him 1
very 1
well. 1

He 0
received 0
me 0
twice 0
during 0
the 0
Council, 0
for 0
a 0
private 0
audience 0
with 0
the 0
pope. 0

But, 0
now, 0
with 0
my 0
position 0
against 0
the 0
Council 0
and 0
the 0
reforms, 0
he 0
says: 0
“No, 0
impossible! 0

You 0
must 0
sign 0
in 0
writing 0
that 0
you 0
[accept] 0
the 0
Council 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
reforms 0
before 0
I 0
will 0
receive 0
you 0
in 0
audience.” 0
But 0
I 0
cannot 0
do 0
that. 0

For 0
me, 0
if 1
I 1
do 1
that, 1
then 1
I 1
betray 1
my 1
mother, 1
the 1
Church. 1

The 1
Church! 1

So, 0
I 0
thank 0
you 0
very 0
much 0
for 0
your 0
encouragement, 0
and 0
I 0
must 0
say 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
generation 0
of 0
young 0
men 0
and 0
good 0
vocations. 0

For 0
the 0
coming 0
year 0
we 0
have 0
59 0
applications 0
to 0
our 0
seminary 0
in 0
Econe, 0
Switzerland 0
– 0
applications 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
from 0
England, 0
from 0
Germany, 0
from 0
France, 0
and 0
Spain. 0

Good 0
young 0
men 0
with 0
good 0
dispositions 0
are 0
coming 0
from 0
everywhere. 0

And 0
why? 0

Why 0
do 0
they 0
come 0
to 0
this 0
seminary 0
when 0
they 0
know 0
we 0
are 0
in 0
difficulties 0
with 0
Rome? 0

They 0
know 0
that. 0

But 0
still 0
they 0
come. 0

I 0
ask 0
them, 0
why 0
do 0
you 0
come 0
to 0
Econe? 0

You 0
know 0
our 0
situation. 0

They 0
say, 0
“Yes, 0
we 0
know 0
your 0
situation, 0
but 0
we 0
want 0
to 0
become 0
true 0
priests 0
and 0
not 0
protestant 0
pastors 0
or 0
modernist 0
priests. 0

We 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
your 0
seminary 0
because 0
we 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
priest 0
is 0
to 0
offer 0
the 0
true 0
Sacrifice 0
of 0
the 0
Mass. 0

And 0
so, 0
we 0
are 0
Coming 0
to 0
Econe.” 0

And 0
as 0
I 0
have 0
visited 0
my 0
seminary 0
here 0
in 0
Armada 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
five 0
days, 0
I 0
can 0
see 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
here. 0

We 0
have 0
very 0
good 0
young 0
men. 0

I 0
also 0
have 0
some 0
Americans 0
in 0
my 0
seminary 0
in 0
Econe. 0

In 0
six 0
weeks 0
I 0
will 0
ordain 0
one 0
American 0
priest 0
from 0
Detroit, 0
who 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
seminarian 0
and 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
priest. 0

But 0
these 0
young 0
men 0
refuse 0
to 0
become 0
protestants. 0

They 0
refuse 0
to 0
become 0
modernist. 0

They 0
ask 0
to 0
become 0
true 0
priests. 0

And 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
pity 0
there 0
are 0
not 0
100 0
bishops 0
opening 0
good 0
seminaries. 0

So, 0
I 0
ask 0
you 0
to 0
pray 0
for 0
these 0
seminarians 0
because 0
when 0
they 0
become 0
priests 0
they 0
will 0
have 0
many 0
worries 0
and 0
many 0
difficulties. 0

I 0
think, 0
however, 0
they 0
are 0
very 0
well 0
prepared 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
these 0
difficulties 0
and 0
worries. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
confidence 0
in 0
God. 0

Since 0
I 0
began 0
this 0
work 0
six 0
years 0
ago, 0
now, 0
I 0
have 0
evidence 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
assisting 0
us. 0

Because 0
it 0
is 0
impossible, 0
I 0
realize, 0
to 0
do 0
this 0
by 0
myself. 0

We 0
now 0
have 0
houses 0
in 0
Switzerland 0
(3), 0
Munich, 0
France 0
(6), 0
Brussels 0
(1), 0
England, 0
Armada, 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
and 0
New 0
York. 0

In 0
Albano, 0
near 0
Rome, 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
congregation 0
of 0
sisters 0
where 0
I 0
have 0
five 0
vocations 0
from 0
the 0
states 0
(good 0
sisters). 0

And 0
I 0
am 0
building 0
a 0
seminary 0
in 0
Switzerland. 0

It 1
is 1
impossible 1
to 1
do 1
all 1
this 1
without 1
God’s 1
assistance. 1

So, 0
I 0
have 0
confidence. 0

It 0
is 0
impossible 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
change 0
its 0
tradition. 0

The 0
tradition 0
of 0
twenty 0
centuries. 0

That 1
we 1
cannot 1
change. 1

The 0
Church 0
is 0
tradition. 0

The 1
Church 1
is 1
tradition. 1

It 0
is 0
not 0
revolution. 0

I 1
thank 1
you 1
for 1
your 1
attention. 1

from 0

the 0

of 0

examples 0
of 0
how 0
the 0

bans 1

admitting 1

Pamela 0

and 0
I 0
are 0
banned 0

entering 0
the 0
country 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
telling 0
the 0
truth 0
about 0
Islam 0
and 0
jihad. 0

According 0
to 0
Breitbart, 0
“Sellner, 0
who 0
described 0
the 0
detention 0
centre 0
as 0
looking 0
akin 0
to 0
a 0
typical 0
American 0
prison, 0
said 0
he 1
was 1
told 1
by 1
authorities 1
that 1
his 1
speaking 1
at 1
Hyde 1
Park 1
could 1
cause 1
violence 1
and 1
disrupt 1
community 1
cohesion.” 1

That’s 1
just 1
what 1
they 1
claimed 1
about 1
Pamela 1
Geller 1
and 1
me: 1
that 1
our 1
visit 1
could 1
cause 1
violence 1
and 1
disrupt 1
community 1
cohesion. 1

But 0
we, 0
of 0
course, 0
have 0
never 0
advocated 0
or 0
approved 0
of 0
any 0
violence. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
meant 0
that 0
our 0
visit 0
could 0
cause 0
violence 0
from 0
Muslims. 0

They 1
were 1
bowing 1
to 1
jihadist 1
intimidation. 1

Meanwhile, 1
Britain 1
has 1
a 1
steadily 1
lengthening 1
record 1
of 1
admitting 1
jihad 1
preachers 1
without 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
hesitation. 1

Syed 0
Muzaffar 0
Shah 0
Qadri’s 0
preaching 1
of 1
hatred 1
and 1
jihad 1
violence 1
was 0
so 0
hardline 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
preaching 0
in 0
Pakistan, 0
but 0
the 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
welcomed 0
him 0
into 0
Britain. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
also 0
admitted 0
Shaykh 0
Hamza 0
Sodagar 0
into 0
the 0
country, 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
said: 0
“If 1
there’s 1
homosexual 1
men, 1
the 1
punishment 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
five 1
things. 1

One 1
– 1
the 1
easiest 1
one 1
maybe 1
– 1
chop 1
their 1
head 1
off, 1
that’s 1
the 1
easiest. 1

Second 1
– 1
burn 1
them 1
to 1
death. 1

Third 1
– 1
throw 1
’em 1
off 1
a 1
cliff. 1

Fourth 1
– 1
tear 1
down 1
a 1
wall 1
on 1
them 1
so 1
they 1
die 1
under 1
that. 1

Fifth 1
– 1
a 1
combination 1
of 1
the 1
above.” 1

Theresa 0
May’s 0
relentlessly 1
appeasement-minded 1
government 1
also 0
admitted 0
two 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
who 0
had 0
praised 0
the 0
murderer 0
of 0
a 0
foe 0
of 0
Pakistan’s 0
blasphemy 0
laws. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
was 0
welcomed 0
by 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Canterbury. 0

Nor 0
does 0
the 0
UK 0
admit 0
only 0
preachers 0
of 0
jihad 0
terror. 0

It 0
admits 0
jihad 0
terrorists 0
as 0
well, 0
even 0
when 0
it 0
knows 0
they 0
are 0
jihad 0
terrorists. 0

The 0
Muslim 0
migrant 0
teen 0
who 0
bombed 0
the 0

border 0
officials 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
trained 0
by 0
ISIS, 0
but 0
was 0
admitted 0
anyway. 0

Above 1

“We 0

not 0

his 1

we 0

During 0
his 0
January 0
confirmation 0
hearings 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee, 0
Barr 0
testified 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
“provide 0
as 0
much 0
transparency” 0
as 0
he 0
could 0
regarding 0
Mueller’s 0
report. 0

“I 0
also 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
that 0
the 0
public 0
and 0
Congress 0
be 0
informed 0
of 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
the 0
special 0
counsel’s 0

For 0
that 0
reason 0
my 0
goal 0
will 0
be 0
to 0
provide 0
as 0
much 0
transparency 0
as 0
I 0
can 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
law,” 0
Barr 0
told 0
the 0
committee. 0

“I 0
can 0
assure 0
you 0
that, 0
where 0
judgments 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
by 0
me, 0
I 0
will 0
make 0
those 0

Well, 0
it’s 0

quite 0
a 0

weeks 0

the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0

I 0

some 0
people 0
are, 0
to 0
put 0

bluntly, 0
freaking 1
out. 1

The 0

the 0

over 0
the 0
McCarrick 0

is 0
boiling 0
over 0
into 0
the 0

we 0

“the 0

Bishop 0
Thomas 0
Tobin 0

- 0
nicknamed 0
the 0
“Good 1
Tobin” 1
in 0

to 0
the 0
“Bad 1

and 0
FrancisCardinal, 0
Joseph 0
Tobin 0

Newark 0

got 0
quite 0
an 0
earful 0
when 0
he 0

“Despite 0

despite 0

I’m 0

I 0
admire 0
and 0
applaud 0
the 0
great 0
work 0
they 0
do 0
everyday 0
for 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Church.” 0

The 0
replies 0
haven’t 0
topped 0
out 0
yet, 0
at 0
121, 0
nearly 0
all 0
of 0
them 0
expressing 0
outrage 1
at 0
this 0
cavalier 0
attitude 0
toward 0
the 0
revelation 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
has 0
been 0
proven 0
to 0
be 0
a 1
life-long 1
homosexual 1
rapist 1
and 1
sexual 1
predator, 1
grooming 0
and 0
trapping 0
young 0
men 0
and 0
children 0
into 0
unwanted 0
sexual 0
contact; 0
and 0
that 0
nearly 0
the 0
entire 0
episcopate 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
either 0
colluded 0
directly 0
or 0
kept 0
quiet 0
about 0
it. 0

It’s 0
clear 0
that 0
even 0
the 0
“good 0
bishops” 0
have 0
simply 0
no 0
idea 0
how 0
close 0
they 0
are 0
to 0
being 0
bodily 0
chucked 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
own 0
churches 0
by 0
furious 0
mobs. 0

As 0
I 0
wrote 0
elsewhere, 0
since 0
2002, 0
most 0
Catholics 0
know 0
perfectly 1
well, 0
despite 0
the 0
lame 1
whitewashing 0
attempt, 0
that 0
“the 0
US 0
bishops 0
gave 0
themselves 0
a 0
pass” 0
on 0
clerical 0
sex 0
abuse 0
with 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Charter 0
“a 0
thing 0
that 0
brazenly 0
shifted 0
blame.” 0
And 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
though 0
they’re 0
still 0
doing 0
this, 0
quite 0
a 0
few 0
lay 0
Catholics 0
just 0
aren’t 0
having 0
it. 0

We 0
are 0
seeing 0
the 0
final 0
slide, 0
the 0
expected 0
and 0
inevitable 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
100 0
years. 0

The 0
Church 0
was 0
infiltrated, 0
we 0
know 0
this, 0
in 0
the 0
19th 0
century 0
by 0
some 0
pretty 0
dark 1
forces, 1
and 0
they 0
have 0
finally 0
come 0
into 0
the 0
ascendancy 0
and 0
are 0
showing 0
themselves 0
quite 0
clearly 0
for 0
what 0
they 0
are. 0

The 0
McCarrick 0
news 0
– 0
and 0
all 0
the 0
stuff 0
swirling 0
around 0
it 0
like 0
the 0
latest 0
about 0
Bishop 0
Pineda 0
and 0
his 0
connection 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
through 0
Cardinal 0
Maradiaga 0
– 0
has 0
not 0
come 0
in 0
contrast 0
to 0
this 0
but 0
as 0
an 0
intrinsic 0
part 0
of 0
it. 0

The 0
scandal 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
toxic 1
emission, 0
a 0
venting 0
of 0
the 0
gasses 0
that 0
build 0
up 0
naturally 0
around 0
any 0
rotting 1
thing. 0

Rod 0
Dreher[1] 0
is 0
doing 0
excellent 0
work 0
compiling 0
testimony 0
from 0
priests 0
and 0
others 0
saying 0
out 0
loud 0
at 0
last 0
what 0
many 0
of 0
us 0
had 0
known 0
for 0
many 0
years 0
about 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
his 0
gang. 0

It 0
has 0
shown 0
the 0
world 0
what 0
Traditionalists 0
have 0
known, 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
emphatically 0
NOT 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
one 0
“bad 0
apple” 0
or 0
even 0
only 0
a 0
“few” 0
as 0
the 0
hapless 0
“conservative” 0
Bishop 0
Tobin 0
tried 0
to 0
claim 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
result 0
of 0
a 0
mass-collusion. 0

As 0
our 0
friend 0
Steve 0
Skojec 0
put 0
it 0
the 0
other 0
day, 0
“We’ve 0
got 0
to 0
stop 0
pretending 0
it’s 0
just 0
the 0
progressive 0
element 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
‘conservatives’ 0
are 0
complicit, 0
too.” 0
In 0
short, 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
during 0
his 0
days 0
of 0
glory, 0
globe 0
trotting 0
on 0
the 0
dime 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
Department, 0
hosting 0
presidents 0
for 0
dinner 0
and 0
inviting 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Mother 0
Theresa 0
to 0
tea, 0
so 0
it 0
is 0
now: 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm. 0

Whether 0
he 0
now 0
has 0
to 0
go 0
live 0
in 0
obscurity 0
in 0
some 0
beach 0
house 0
in 0
the 0
Caymans, 0
it 0
will 0
remain 0
true: 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
the 0
“New 0
Church.” 0

A 0
point 0
that 0
Dreher’s 0
informants 0
have 0
brought 0
up 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
emphatic: 0
the 0
homosexualist 1
cabal 1
that 0
is 0
currently 0
reported 0
to 0
be 0
dominant 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
hierarchy 0
(and 0
don’t 0
imagine 0
this 0
is 0
confined 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
English 0
speaking 0
world) 0
have 0
a 0
well 0
documented 0
methodology 0
of 0
mutual 0
protection-and-threat 0
that 0
keeps 0
the 0
whole 0
apparatus 0
afloat. 0

In 0
briefest 0
and 0
simplest 0
possible 0
terms, 0
immoral 0
or 0
even 0
illegal 0
sexual 0
activity 0
is 0
preferred 0
because 0
it 0
leaves 0
a 0
man 0
open 0
to 0
blackmail, 0
to 0
control 0
through 0
fear 0
of 0
exposure[2]. 0

When 0
that 0
blackmailing 0
culture 0
becomes 0
ascendant, 0
it 0
will 0
always 0
reject 0
the 0
morally 0
upright 0
as 0
too 0
dangerous, 0
too 0
difficult 0
to 0
control. 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
faithful 0
seminarians 0
are 0
rejected 0
and 0
why 0
faithful 0
priests 0
are 0
harassed. 0

As 0
Dreher 0
reported, 0

When 0
predatory 1
gay 1
priests 1
run 0
seminaries, 0
they 0
select 0
on 0
a 0
bias 0
for 0
gay 0
candidates... 0

Gay 0
seminarians 0
who 0
intend 0
to 0
be 0
celibate, 0
Sipe 0
said, 0
face 0
tremendous 0
pressure 0
to 0
have 0
sex. 0

If 0
they 0
slip 0
up 0
even 0
once, 0
their 0
failure 0
will 0
be 0
noted, 0
and 0
shared… 0
And 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
made 0
to 0
understand 0
that 0
their 0
lapse 0
is 0
remembered. 0

Later, 0
as 0
a 0
priest, 0
predators 0
within 0
the 0
priesthood 0
have 0
that 0
knowledge 0
to 0
hold 0
over 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
other 0
gay 0
priests, 0
to 0
keep 0
them 0
silent 0
if 0
they 0
ever 0
have 0
the 0
desire 0
to 0
blow 0
whistles. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
covering 0
the 0
scandal 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
2000s, 0
I 0
spoke 0
to 0
several, 0
unconnected 0
heterosexual 0
men 0
— 0
priests, 0
former 0
priests, 0
seminarians 0
— 0
who 0
said 0
that 0
gay 0
seminary 0
rectors 0
or 0
diocesan 0
officials 0
encouraged 0
them 0
to 0
take 0
female 0
sexual 0
partners, 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
too 0
would 0
be 0
complicit 0
in 0
sexual 0
secret-keeping, 0
and 0
therefore 0
no 0
longer 0
[be] 0
a 0
potential 0
danger. 0

Nothing 0
in 0
a 0
system 0
like 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
greater 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
corrupt 0
than 0
men 0
who 0
are 0
not 0
corrupt. 0

For 0
many 0
priests, 0
one 0
might 0
say 0
all 0
good 0
priests, 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
sustainable 0
situation, 0
to 0
say 0
the 0
least. 0

I’ve 0
had 0
quite 0
a 0
few 0
conversations 0
with 0
priests 0
who 0
are 0
now 0
asking 0
how 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
it. 0

How 0
are 0
they 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
offer 0
the 0
sacraments 0
in 0
this 0
situation? 0

Where 0
are 0
they 0
to 0
live? 0

How 0
are 0
they 0
to 0
maintain 0
themselves? 0

These 0
are 0
the 0
priests 0
who 0
did 0
make 0
it 0
through 0
this 0
institutional 0
gauntlet, 0
who 0
remain 0
faithful 0
now 0
but 0
are 0
still 0
under 0
the 0
control 0
of 0
these 0
often 0
grossly 1
corrupt 1
and 1
evil 1
men. 1

As 0
men 0
known 0
to 0
be 0
incorruptible 0
themselves, 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
big 0
target 0
painted 0
on 0
their 0
backs. 0

In 0
short, 0
not 0
only 0
can 0
a 0
bad 0
bishop 0
harry 0
a 0
man 0
out 0
of 0
his 0
ministry, 0
he 0
has 0
complete 0
control 0
over 0
the 0
priest’s 0
material 0
life. 0

The 0
bishop 0
can, 0
with 0
the 0
flick 0
of 0
a 0
pen 0
or 0
a 0
single 0
phone 0
call, 0
render 0
a 0
priest 0
homeless, 0
penniless 0
and 0
jobless. 0

And 0
these, 0
remember, 0
are 0
men, 0
often 0
well 0
on 0
in 0
years, 0
whose 0
only 0
education 0
and 0
employment 0
training 0
has 0
likely 0
been 0
academic 0
degrees 0
in 0
philosophy 0
and 0
theology, 0
and 0
whose 0
only 0
professional 0
contacts 0
are 0
ecclesiastical. 0

Moreover, 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
globalisation 0
of 0
the 0
bishop-network, 0
a 0
man 0
blackballed 0
for 0
his 0
authentic 0
Catholicity 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
pariah 0
in 0
every 0
diocese 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

And 0
with 0
the 0
advent 0
of 0
Bergoglio 0
in 0
Rome, 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
more 0
havens; 0
as 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
former 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
have 0
learned, 0
the 0
blackballing 0
has 0
gone 0
global 0
with 0
this 0
pontificate. 0

He 0
will 0
remain 0
a 0
pariah 0
even 0
among 0
the 0
so-called 0
“good” 0
bishops 0
who 0
live 0
in 0
terror 0
of 0
the 0
immense 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
cabal… 0
(see 0
above 0
re: 0
McCarrick 0
& 0
President 0
Bush/John 0
Paul 0
II.) 0

I 0
have 0
been 0
hearing 0
from 0
priests 0
who 0
are 0
saying 0
in 0
effect, 0
“We’re 0
trapped 0
in 0
this 0
situation 0
and 0
forced 0
to 0
remain 0
silent 0
because 0
if 0
we 0
don’t 0
we’ll 0
not 0
only 0
be 0
unable 0
to 0
function 0
as 0
priests, 0
but 0
we’ll 0
be 0
homeless 0
and 0
penniless. 0

We’re 0
unemployable 0
in 0
any 0
other 0
field.” 0
And 0
as 0
much 0
as 0
we 0
might 0
be 0
tempted 0
to 0
say, 0
“Well 1
suck 1
it 1
up, 1
this 0
is 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
souls,” 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
that 0
these 0
are 0
not 0
small 0
considerations. 0

Many 0
priests 0
are 0
getting 0
older 0
– 0
many 0
of 0
them 0
with 0
health 0
issues 0
– 0
and 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
has 0
already 0
given 0
20 0
or 0
30 0
years 0
of 0
his 0
life 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
faced 0
with 0
a 0
practical 0
impossibility 0
if 0
he 0
finds 0
himself 0
blacklisted. 0

Of 0
course 0
there 0
are 0
some 0
who 0
don’t 0
fit 0
this 0
mould; 0
there 0
are 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
second 0
careers 0
in 0
the 0
priesthood 0
and 0
plenty 0
of 0
people 0
go 0
into 0
seminary 0
after 0
some 0
years 0
in 0
the 0
normal 0
workforce 0
and 0
can 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
it 0
at 0
need. 0

Some 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
now 0
coming 0
forward 0
with 0
complaints 0
against 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
left 0
the 0
priesthood 0
over 0
their 0
experiences, 0
have 0
gone 0
on 0
to 0
have 0
normal, 0
healthy 0
working 0
lives. 0

But 0
I 0
think 0
honestly 0
most 0
priests 0
are 0
in 0
this 0
corner 0
and 0
they 0
know 0
it 0
and 0
so 0
do 0
their 0
bishops. 0

I 0
think 0
a 0
young 0
man 0
goes 0
forward 0
in 0
great 0
faith, 0
spends 0
ten 0
to 0
fifteen 0
years 0
studying 0
philosophy 0
and 0
theology 0
- 0
fields 0
that 0
have 0
almost 0
no 0
application 0
in 0
the 0
workforce 0
outside 0
academia 0
or 0
the 0
Church 0
- 0
with 0
the 0
honest, 0
and 0
frankly 0
fair, 0
expectation 0
of 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
employment 0
and 0
a 0
safety 0
net 0
at 0
the 0
end. 0

As 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
“The 0
old 0
arrangement 0
was, 0
‘Remain 0
faithful, 0
do 0
the 0
work, 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
look 0
after 0
you. 0

We’ll 0
house, 0
feed 0
and 0
clothe 0
you 0
and 0
look 0
after 0
your 0
retirement.’ 0
The 0
new 0
arrangement 0
is 0
a 0
perversion 0
of 0
that: 0
‘Keep 0
quiet 0
and 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
it 0
all 0
and 0
you’ll 0
be 0
fine, 0
but 0
step 0
an 0
inch 0
out 0
of 0
line 0
and 0
we’ll 1
destroy 1
you.’” 1

So 0
what 0
do 0
we 0
do? 0

The 0
Old 0
Paradigm 0
is 0
destroyed 0
and 0
going 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
is 0
a 0
guarantee 0
of 0
destruction 0
for 0
yourself 0
and 0
everyone 0
else. 0

As 0
we 0
saw 0
in 0
Ireland 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
Purge 0
has 0
started. 0

It’s 0
not 0
enough 0
to 0
simply 0
demand 0
that 0
a 0
priest 0
continue 0
in 0
his 0
ministry 0
no 0
matter 0
what. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
start 0
working 0
together 0
with 0
faithful 0
priests 0
– 0
while 0
there 0
still 0
are 0
some 0
– 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
create 0
practical 0
material 0
alternatives. 0

If 0
we 0
who 0
still 0
love 0
the 0
Church 0
want 0
priests 0
to 0
be 0
faithful, 0
and 0
even 0
to 0
start 0
denouncing 0
the 0
evil 0
and 0
corruption 0
they 0
see, 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
create 0
a 0
modicum 0
of 0
independence 0
and 0
security 0
in 0
which 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

The 0
other 0
day 0
the 0
American 0
conservative 0
writer, 0
John 0
Zmirak, 0
wrote 0
a 0
sound 0
suggestion 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
I 0
think 0
it’s 0
time 0
we 0
all 0
started 0
taking 0
seriously. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
continued 0
outrages 0
of 0
both 0
“good” 0
and 0
bad 0
bishops, 0
Zmirak 0
suggested 0
establishing 0
“an 0
escrow 0
fund 0
in 0
each 0
scandal-plagued 0
diocese, 0
where 0
laymen 0
[can] 0
deposit 0
the 0
funds 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
donated 0
to 0
[the] 0
local 0
church, 0
until 0
[a] 0
new 0
bishop 0
[is] 0
appointed.” 0

I 0
responded: 0
“And 0
the 0
money 0
could 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
purchase 0
properties 0
to 0
house 0
faithful 0
priests 0
punished 0
by 0
their 0
bishops 0
for 0
refusing 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm. 0

We 0
could 0
even 0
perhaps 0
buy 0
a 0
few 0
convents 0
so 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
could 0
continue 0
to 0
pray 0
in 0
peace, 0
without 0
harassment 0
from 0
the 0
evil 0
men 0
in 0
Rome.” 0

I 0
am 0
hearing 0
lately 0
from 0
laymen 0
who 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
setting 0
up 0
financial 0
structures 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
authentic 0
Catholic 0
life 0
can 0
be 0
maintained 0
through 0
what 0
is 0
obviously 0
soon 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
general 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
institution. 0

This 0
would 0
mean 0
independent 0
non-profit 0
foundations 0
that 0
could 0
build 0
or 0
buy 0
church 0
buildings, 0
convents 0
and 0
even 0
schools 0
and 0
provide 0
salaries 0
for 0
priests 0
and 0
other 0
staff. 0

I 0
started 0
thinking 0
about 0
this 0
recently 0
when 0
I 0
received 0
a 0
note 0
from 0
a 0
reader 0
with 0
a 0
link 0
to 0
an 0
online 0
petition 0
from 0
Germany, 0
addressed 0
to 0
the 0
German 0
bishops 0
[!!!] 0

“begging” 0
those 0
manifestly 1
evil 1
and 1
apostate 1
men 1
not 0
to 0
close 0
a 0
famous 0
and 0
ancient 0
monastic 0
house. 0

I 0
responded 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
going 0
about 0
things 0
the 0
wrong 0
way. 0

Catholics 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
get 0
their 0
heads 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
mindset 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
helpless 0
petitioners, 0
“begging” 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
to 0
maintain 0
the 0
Faith. 0

First 0
of 0
all, 0
it 0
only 0
gives 0
them 0
a 0
frisson 0
of 0
pleasure 0
to 0
see 0
us 0
groveling 0
and 0
begging 0
for 0
mercy. 0

Let’s 0
not 0
give 0
them 0
that, 0
OK? 0

There’s 0
already 0
enough 0
“frissons 0
of 0
pleasure” 0
in 0
their 0
lives. 0

Second, 0
it’s 0
simply 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
work. 0

In 0
Germany, 0
in 0
the 0
US, 0
in 0
Canada, 0
in 0
Italy, 0
in 0
Britain… 0
throughout 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
1st 0
world, 0
and 0
in 0
much 0
of 0
it 0
elsewhere, 0
the 0
men 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
“institutional 0
Church” 0
– 0
that 0
is, 0
whose 0
names 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
bank 0
accounts 0
– 0
are 0
dedicated 1
to 1
the 1
destruction 1
of 1
everything 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
preserve. 1

The 0
wolves 1
are 0
now 0
looking 0
with 0
ravening 0
eyes 0
at 0
the 0
faithful. 0

They 0
are, 0
in 0
short, 0
our 1
enemies. 1

They’ve 0
become 0
so 0
by 0
making 0
themselves 0
the 0
enemies 0
of 0
Christ 0
and 0
His 0
Holy 0
Church. 0

They 0
know 0
it 0
and 0
it’s 0
time 0
we 0
stopped 0
imagining 0
otherwise. 0

The 0
other 0
suggestion 0
I 0
have 0
is 0
for 0
young 0
men 0
interested 0
in 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
fortify 0
themselves 0
not 0
only 0
spiritually 0
but 0
in 0
the 0
material 0
sphere. 0

There’s 0
one 0
big 0
vulnerability 0
we 0
can 0
guard 0
against 0
pretty 0
easily. 0

No 0
one 0
should 0
be 0
facing 0
penury 0
and 0
permanent 0
unemployment 0
because 0
he’s 0
a 0
faithful 0
Catholic. 0

We 0
should 0
never 0
be 0
letting 0
any 0
young 0
man 0
go 0
into 0
any 0
diocesan 0
seminary 0
without 0
being 0
a 0
property 0
owner. 0

He 0
should 0
own 0
a 0
house 0
or 0
stand 0
to 0
inherit 0
one. 0

Families 0
have 0
to 0
come 0
to 0
see 0
this 0
as 0
a 0
duty 0
to 0
the 0
child 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
Church. 0

And 0
more 0
than 0
that, 0
the 0
potential 0
priest 0
needs 0
to 0
have 0
job 0
skills 0
that 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
priesthood. 0

Among 0
the 0
working 0
classes 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
bias 0
against 0
intellectual 0
work. 0

But 0
most 0
working 0
class 0
people 0
have 0
a 0
pretty 0
sensible 0
attitude 0
towards 0
ambitions 0
in 0
academia: 0
get 0
something 0
under 0
your 0
belt 0
you 0
can 0
fall 0
back 0
on. 0

How 0
many 0
philosophy 0
PhDs 0
can 0
build 0
himself 0
a 0
bookshelf? 0

Change 0
the 0
oil 0
in 0
a 0
car? 0

Rewire 0
a 0
house? 0

The 0
standard 0
cliché 0
of 0
young 0
people 0
with 0
useless 0
academic 0
degrees 0
working 0
at 0
Starbucks 0
has 0
become 0
so 0
common 0
it’s 0
not 0
even 0
worth 0
memeing 0
anymore. 0

How 0
many 0
young 0
men 0
do 0
we 0
foresee 0
being 0
forced 0
out 0
of 0
seminary 0
for 0
having 0
the 0
wrong 0
“sexual 0
orientation”? 0

Every 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
guys 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
snap 0
his 0
fingers 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
rector 0
and 0
walk 0
straight 0
into 0
a 0
decent 0
job, 0
based 0
not 0
on 0
any 0
recommendation 0
from 0
a 0
corrupt 0
bishop, 0
but 0
on 0
his 0
solid 0
skills. 0

Among 0
the 0
white 0
collar 0
classes 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
bias 0
against 0
blue 0
collar 0
work, 0
but 0
the 0
trades 0
are 0
crying 0
out 0
for 0
skilled 0
men 0
and 0
a 0
trade 0
school 0
diploma 0
in 0
fixing 0
tractors 0
is 0
a 0
lot 0
cheaper 0
and 0
a 0
lot 0
faster 0
to 0
get 0
than 0
a 0
university 0
degree. 0

That’s 0
an 0
economic 0
asset 0
that 0
we 0
can’t 0
afford 0
to 0
turn 0
up 0
our 0
well-educated 0
noses 0
at. 0

It 0

reminds 0

me 0
of 0
a 0
discussion 0
I 0
had 0
some 0
years 0
ago 0
with 0
the 0
prior 0
of 0
a 0
Benedictine 0
monastery 0
that 0
is 0
attracting 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
young 0
vocations. 0

One 0
kid 0
wanted 0
to 0
join 0
and 0
told 0
me 0
they 0
had 0
recommended 0
he 0
go 0
to 0
some 0
college 0
or 0
other 0
to 0
study 0
philosophy 0
first. 0

This 0
college, 0
apparently, 0
waives 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
tuition 0
and 0
gives 0
work 0
studies 0
to 0
people 0
going 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood 0
and 0
religious 0
life 0
so 0
they 0
can 0
avoid 0
the 0
student 0
loan 0
trap. 0

This 0
is 0
fine, 0
good 0
idea. 0

But 0
I 0
asked 0
him 0
what 0
he 0
knew 0
how 0
to 0
do. 0

“Can 0
you 0
fix 0
a 0
bathroom 0
pipe? 0

Do 0
you 0
know 0
anything 0
about 0
what 0
to 0
feed 0
a 0
sheep 0
or 0
how 0
to 0
care 0
for 0
a 0
cow? 0

Can 0
you 0
drive 0
a 0
tractor?” 0
This 0
nice 0
kid, 0
who 0
certainly 0
does 0
have 0
a 0
vocation, 0
could 0
read 0
books 0
and 0
look 0
things 0
up 0
on 0
the 0
internet 0
and 0
write 0
a 0
pretty 0
mean 0
paper 0
on 0
Thomas 0
Aquinas, 0
but 0
not 0
a 0
lot 0
else. 0

There 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
shift 0
in 0
attitude 0
in 0
our 0
remaining 0
faithful 0
institutions. 0

Does 0
a 0
monastery 0
really 0
need 0
all 0
of 0
its 0
members 0
to 0
have 0
PhDs 0
in 0
philosophy 0
and 0
theology? 0

Wouldn’t 0
it 0
also 0
be 0
useful 0
to 0
have 0
an 0
electrician, 0
a 0
plumber, 0
a 0
carpenter, 0
a 0
cook, 0
someone 0
who 0
knows 0
how 0
to 0
fix 0
a 0
car 0
or 0
a 0
tractor? 0

Or 0
for 0
that 0
matter, 0
a 0
certified 0
accountant 0
or 0
an 0
investment 0
banker? 0

If 0
you 0
insist 0
on 0
having 0
people 0
with 0
degrees, 0
maybe 0
a 0
degree 0
in 0
agriculture 0
would 0
be 0
a 0
good 0
fit 0
for 0
a 0
big 0
monastic 0
foundation 0
with 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
land 0
like, 0
say, 0
Clear 0
Creek 0
or 0
that 0
new 0
Carmelite 0
place 0
in 0
Nebraska. 0

I 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
time 0
we 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
start 0
overcoming 0
our 0
class 0
snobbery. 0

Young 0
men 0
with 0
ambitions 0
for 0
the 0
priesthood 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
have 0
to 0
tuck 0
away 0
employability 0
and 0
an 0
independent 0
financial 0
foundation, 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
way 0
people 0
used 0
to 0
tuck 0
money 0
away 0
against 0
a 0
rainy 0
day. 0

Simply 0
put, 0
they’ve 0
got 0
to 0
stop 0
being 0
materially 0
dependent 0
on 0
the 0
hierarchy. 0

This 0
vulnerability 0
is 0
a 0
gun 0
to 0
their 0
heads 0
in 0
this 0
time. 0

The 0
next 0
kid 0
who 0
says 0
anything 0
to 0
me 0
about 0
wanting 0
to 0
enter 0
the 0
diocesan 0
priesthood, 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
ask, 0
“How 0
sound 0
is 0
your 0
investment 0
portfolio?” 0
The 0
next 0
candidate 0
for 0
religious 0
life, 0
I’ll 0
ask, 0
“Great! 0

What’s 0
your 0
trade? 0

What 0
do 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
fall 0
back 0
on?” 0

I’m 0
given 0
to 0
understand 0
that 0
some 0
houses 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
of 0
the 0
Oratory 0
ask 0
candidates 0
to 0
come 0
with 0
an 0
independent 0
income, 0
which, 0
given 0
what 0
we’re 0
seeing 0
elsewhere 0
doesn’t 0
sound 0
like 0
a 0
bad 0
idea. 0

Perhaps 0
Catholic 0
financial 0
advisors 0
could 0
be 0
encouraged 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
a 0
programme 0
to 0
teach 0
young 0
men 0
how 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
sound 0
financial 0
footing 0
with 0
investments. 0

Meanwhile, 0
we 0
must 0
refocus 0
our 0
energy 0
on 0
the 0
Faith 0
itself, 0
instead 0
of 0
the 0
physical 0
and 0
even 0
canonical 0
structures 0
that 0
house 0
it. 0

That 0
monastery 0
in 0
Germany 0
is 0
lost. 0

Those 0
bishops 0
want 0
the 0
property 0
and 0
they’ll 0
get 0
it. 0

What 0
the 0
group 0
of 0
laymen 0
should 0
be 0
doing, 0
instead 0
of 0
petitioning 0
that 0
it 0
be 0
saved, 0
is 0
finding 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
the 0
nuns 0
can 0
live 0
their 0
charism 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
without 0
episcopal 0
harassment. 0

Bishops 0
won’t 0
protect 0
and 0
support 0
good 0
priests? 0

Then 1
it’s 1
up 1
to 1
us. 1

The 0
Vatican 0
wants 0
to 0
force 0
all 0
religious 0
congregations 0
into 0
the 0
pants-wearing, 0
Marxist 0
anti-nun, 0
LCWR 0
pattern? 0

We’re 0
not 0
helpless. 0

We 0
start 0
buying 0
convent 0
buildings 0
and 0
start 0
a 0
fund 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
nun-refugees. 0

Our 0
goal 0
must 0
be 0
preserving 0
the 0
precious 0
treasure, 0
the 0
Deposit 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
the 0
sacramental 0
life, 0
the 0
great 0
charisms 0
and 0
artifacts 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
life. 0

I 0
am 0
reminded 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
curators 0
of 0
the 0
Hermitage 0
Museum 0
in 0
St. 0
Petersburg 0
did 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
advancing 0
German 0
army. 0

They 0
took 0
down, 0
packed 0
up 0
and 0
hid 0
the 0
art 0
treasures, 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
greatest 0
in 0
the 0
world. 0

Over 0
a 0
million 0
precious 0
works 0
of 0
art 0
were 0
sent 0
on 0
trains 0
to 0
be 0
hidden 0
in 0
the 0
Urals. 0

Two 0
trains 0
got 0
away 0
to 0
safety, 0
but 0
one 0
was 0
still 0
there 0
when 0
the 0
Germans 0
surrounded 0
the 0
city 0
and 0
began 0
the 0
siege. 0

The 0
museum’s 0
website 0
tells 0
us: 0

“Despite 0
starvation 0
and 0
severely 0
cold 0
temperatures, 0
the 0
Museum 0

the 0

were 0

they 0
and 0
their 0

give 0
tours 0
and 0
lectures, 0
describing 0
perfectly 0
the 0

that 0
had 0
been 0
removed. 0

They 0
understood 0
the 0
value 0
of 0
what 0
they 0
had, 0
and 0
did 0
everything 0
within 0
their 0
power 0
to 0
preserve 0
and 0
protect 0
it. 0

Does 0
this 0
all 0
sound 0
a 0
bit, 0
well, 0
schismatic? 0

Not 0
necessarily. 0

Any 0
bishop 0
who 0
can 0
demonstrate 0
through 0
his 0
actions 0
and 0
not 0
just 0
with 0
his 0
tweets, 0
who 0
can 0
prove 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
Catholic 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
wolf, 1
is 0
welcome 0
to 0
join 0
us. 0

But 0
we’d 0
be 0
fools 0
to 0
wait 0
for 0
them. 0

Whatever 0
you 0
might 0
think 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Lefebvre’s 0
solution 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
decades, 0
it 0
certainly 0
seems 0
inarguable 0
that 0
the 0
“state 0
of 0
emergency” 0
for 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
preparing 0
has 0
come 0
at 0
last. 0

And 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
emergency, 0
certain 0
norms 0
are 0
naturally 0
suspended. 0

The 0
simple 0
fact 0
is 0
that 0
soon 0
there 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
“vagus” 0
priests 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
thrown 0
out 0
of 0
their 0
ministry 0
for 0
maintaining 0
the 0
Faith. 0

There 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
nuns 0
and 0
monks 0
without 0
homes, 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
England 0
of 0
Henry 0
VIII. 0

I 0
think 0
it’s 0
only 0
reasonable 0
that 0
those 0
who 0
also 0
want 0
to 0
maintain 0
the 0
Faith 0
should 0
reach 0
out 0
to 0
them 0
and 0
offer 0
what 0
shelter 0
we 0
can. 0

What 0
we 0
have 0
seen 0
this 0
week 0
is 0
making 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
simply 0
no 0
longer 0
sit 0
back 0
and 0
“beg” 0
bishops 0
to 0
maintain 0
and 0
defend 0
the 0
Faith. 0

It’s 0
not 0
enough 0
now 0
to 0
go 0
into 0
seminary 0
or 0
a 0
monastery 0
with 0
glowing 0
eyes 0
and 0
a 0
firm 0
faith. 0

Sentiment 0
isn’t 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
much 0
comfort 0
when 0
the 0
young 0
man 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
so 0
very 0
young 0
and 0
finds 0
himself 0
standing 0
on 0
the 0
street 0
outside 0
the 0
chancery 0
with 0
no 0
skills, 0
no 0
money, 0
no 0
job, 0
(no 0
health 0
insurance) 0
and 0
no 0
prospects. 0

If 0
it 0
is 0
true 0
that 0
we 0
really 0
are 0
alone 0
in 0
this, 0
then 1
so 1
be 1
it. 1

Let’s 0
stop 0
lamenting 0
and 0
start 0
doing 0
practical 0
things 0
about 0
it. 0

___________________________________ 0

[1] 0
Dreher 0
and 0
others 0
are 0
asking 0
some 0
very 0
important 0
questions 0
now 0
about 0
the 0
activities 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
McCarrick 0
is 0
known 0
to 0
have 0
mentored, 0
one 0
of 0
whom 0
is 0
currently 0
making 0
interesting 0
headlines 0
as 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
Cardinal 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
Dicastery 0
for 0
Laity, 0
Family 0
and 0
Life, 0
and 0
as 0
the 0
primary 0
organiser 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Families 0
in 0
his 0
native 0
Dublin. 0

It 0
should 0
probably 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
time 0
he 0
left 0
over 0
a 0
“difference 0
of 0
opinion” 0
with 0
the 0
group’s 0
leadership, 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell 0
as 0
also 0
deeply 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ. 0

He 0
joined 0
in 0
1966, 0
was 0
ordained 0
in 0
’78, 0
and 0
was 0
quickly 0
appointed 0
to 0
a 0
high-ranking 0
position 0
as 0
general 0
director 0
with 0
responsibility 0
for 0
seminaries 0
and 0
schools 0
of 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ 0
in 0
Italy, 0
Spain 0
and 0
Ireland 0
until 0
1983. 0

This 0
period 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
peak 0
of 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 0
grotesquely 0
corrupt 0
Fr. 0

Maciel, 0
for 0
whom 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
shown 0
ALL 0
the 0
Legion’s 0
leadership 0
was 0
covering. 0

The 0
Farrell 0
family’s 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
Legion 0
continues 0
with 0
his 0
brother, 0
Bishop 0
Brian 0
Farrell, 0
who 0
ordained 0
20 0
new 0
priests 0
to 0
the 0
questionable-but-officially-reformed 0
community 0
in 0
2015. 0

A 0
recent 0
post 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
Regnum 0
Christi 0
website 0
shows 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
is 0
still 0
close 0
enough 0
to 0
the 0
Legion-related 0
“lay” 0
organisation 0
to 0
hire 0
dicastery 0
staff 0
from 0
their 0
ranks. 0

After 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
Legion, 0
Kevin 0
Farrell 0
joined 0
the 0
diocesan 0
clergy 0
in 0
Washington 0
DC 0
and 0
became 0
a 0
protégé 0
of 0
the 0
archbishop, 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl. 0

So 0
close 0
is 0
he 0
to 0
McCarrick 0
that 0
Farrell’s 0
coat 0
of 0
arms, 0
as 0
Elizabeth 0
Yore 0
reported 0
in 0
these 0
pages, 0
is 0
not 0
much 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
tribute 0
to 0
his 0
belatedly-disgraced 0
mentor. 0

So, 0
someone 0
in 0
a 0
journalistic 0
capacity 0
might 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
asking 0
a 0
few 0
questions 0
about 0
these 0
things 0
too. 0

[2] 0
It 0
should 0
also 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
in 0
his 0
book, 0
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope, 0
historian 0
Henry 0
Sire 0
documented 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
how 0
Jorge 0
Bergoglio 0
has 0
always 0
operated, 0
collecting 0
bad 0
men 0
around 0
him 0
and 0
controlling 0
them 0
with 0
a 0
masterful 0
combination 0
of 0
threats 0
and 0
rewards. 0

The 0
natural 0
question, 0
“Why 0
does 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
keep 0
such 0
bad 0
men 0
around 0
him?” 0
is 0
now 0
easy 0
to 0
answer. 0

asked 0
whether 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
important 0
for 0
voters 0
to 0
know 0
that 0
or 0
not, 0
Smith 0
said, 0
“That’s 1
not 1
for 1

to 1
know.” 1

Of 0
course, 0
anyone 0
following 0
what 0
Gillum 0
has 0
been 0
promoting 0
knows 0
he 0
isn't 0
planning 0
on 0
delivering 0
just 0
like 0
many 0
politicians. 0

“So, 0
let’s 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Gillum’s 0
platform, 0
right?” 0
said 0
Smith. 0

“Raise 0
the 0
corporate 0
tax 0
in 0
Florida 0
from 0
7 0
to 0
11 0
percent. 0

That 0
will 0

happen. 0

Raise 0

that 0
will 0
never 0
happen. 0

Give 0
me 0
another 0
position. 0

Medicare 0
for 0
all, 0
that 0
will 0
never 0
happen.” 0

What's 0
even 0
more 0
amazing, 0
but 0
not 0
surprising, 0
is 0
that 0
Gillum 0
has 0
claimed 0
that 0
his 0
opponent 0
is 0
a 0
racist, 0
but 0
the 0
video 0
demonstrates 0
the 1
utter 1
racism 1
of 1
Smith, 1
which 0
one 0
can 0
then 0
conclude 0
that 0
Gillum 0
knows 0
about 0
Smith's 0
racism 0
and 0
keeps 0
him 0
on 0
staff 0
anyway. 0

“This 1
is 1
a 1
f***ed 1
up 1
state,” 1
said 0
Smith. 0

“It’s 1
a 1
cracker 1
state.” 1

Smith 0
also 0
stated 0
that 0
the 0
campaign 0
has 0
“to 1
appeal 1
to 1
white 1
guilt.” 1

Good 1
luck 1
with 1
that! 1

It 0
gets 0
worse 0
though. 0

Smith 0
says 0
that 0
Gillum 0
is 1
“a 1
progressive” 1
who 1
is 1
“a 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
crazy, 1
crazy, 1
crazies.” 1

NEW: 0
The 0
honesty 0
of 0
Gillum's 0
campaign 0
staff 0
on 0
undercover 0
video 0
is 0
refreshing, 0
especially 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
who 0
the 0
real 0
Andrew 0
Gillum 0
is. 0

While 0
trying 0
to 0
appear 0
as 0
a 0
moderate, 0
"Gillum 0
is 0
a 0
Progressive" 0
and 0
"He 0

Since 0
the 0
airborne 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
can 0
kill 0
a 0
person 0
in 0
just 0
three 0
hours, 0
experts 0
warn 0
that 0
its 0
too 0
soon 0
to 0
think 0
that 0
since 0
there 0
hasn’t 0
been 0
a 0
person 0
infected 0
in 0
recent 0
days, 0
that 0
it 0
won’t 0
pop 0
up 0
again. 0

That’s 0
because 0
the 1
bacteria 1
that 1
causes 1
plague 1
is 1
now 1
so 1
widespread 1
in 1
wildlife, 1
that 1
humans 1
can’t 1
do 1
anything 1
to 1
get 1
rid 1
of 1
it, 1

“It’s 1
not 1
possible 1
to 1
eradicate 1
plague, 1
as 0
it 0
is 0
widespread 0
in 0
wildlife 0
rodents 0
outside 0
the 0
sphere 0
of 0
human 0
influence,” 0
Cheng 0
wrote 0
on 0
The 0
Conversation. 0

“Outbreaks, 0
generally, 0
are 0
managed 0
reactively 0
by 0
‘firefighting 0
teams’, 0
deployed 0
to 0
clear 0
houses 0
of 0
fleas, 0
identify 0
and 0
treat 0
cases 0
and 0
give 0
pre-emptive 0
treatment 0
to 0

A 0
more 0
preventative 0
approach, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
identification 0
of 0
areas 0
at 0
risk 0
using 0
climate 0
models 0
and 0
animal 0
surveys 0
to 0
focus 0
flea 0
and 0
rat 0
control 0
efforts, 0
would 0
be 0
better,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“But, 0
this 0
requires 0
a 0
better 0
understanding 0
of 0
transmission 0
pathways 0
in 0
each 0
region 0
where 0
disease 0
persists.” 0

The 0
best 0
way 0
to 0
stop 0
the 0
plague 0
spreading 0
was 0
to 0
focus 0
on 0
flea 0

at 0

171 0

died 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
over 0
an 0
outbreak 0
of 0
plague. 0

Nine 0
countries 0
were 0
urged 0
by 0
the 0
World 0
Health 0
Organisation 0
(WHO) 0
to 0
prepare 1
for 1
a 1
black 1
death 1

at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
October. 0

It’s 0
been 0
reported 0
that 0
plague 0
has 0
been 0
transmitted 0
to 0
humans 0
by 0
camels, 0
goats, 0
prairie 0
dogs, 0
rock 0
squirrels 0
and 0
guinea 0
pigs 0
since 0
the 0
1960’s. 0

There 0
are 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
remaining 0
hotspots 0
for 0
plague 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
– 0
Madagascar 0
being 0
one 0
of 0
them. 0

This 0
outbreak 0
was 0
also 0
highly 0
“unusual”, 0
in 0
that 0
several 0
different 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
island 0
were 0
affected, 0
including 0
areas 0
with 0

WHO 0
has 0
reported 0
2119 0
cases 0
of 0
the 0

as 0
of 0
November 0
10. 0

171 0
have 0
died 0
of 0
the 0
disease 0
so 0
far. 0

We 0
Should 0
Be 0
More 0
Like 0
Sweden: 0
Gov 0
May 0
Use 0
Army 0
Against 0
Immigrant 0
Gangs 0

Progressives 0
say 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
more 0
like 0
Sweden. 0

That 0
means 0
turning 0
our 0
country 0
into 0
a 1
hopeless 1
hellhole 1
where 1
the 1
native 1
population 1
is 1
overtaxed 1
and 1
terrorized 1
by 1
warring 1
foreign 1
gangs. 1

We're 0
getting 0
there 0
too. 0

What 0
should 0
we 0
do? 0

Maybe 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
more 0
like 0
Sweden? 0

Sweden 0
will 0
do 0
whatever 0
it 0
takes, 0
including 0
sending 0
in 0
the 0
army, 0
to 0
end 0
a 0
wave 0
of 0
gang 0
violence 0
that 0
has 0
seen 0
a 0
string 0
of 0
deadly 0
shootings, 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Stefan 0
Lofven 0
said 0
in 0
Wednesday. 0

Sweden's 0
murder 0
rate 0
is 0
relatively 0
low 0
in 0
international 0
terms, 0
but 0
gang 0
violence 0
has 0
surged 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
and 0
Swedes 0
are 0
worried 0
that 0
the 0
police 0
are 0
unable 0
to 0
cope. 0

Of 1
course 1
they 1
can't 1
cope. 1

It's 0
Demolition 1
Man 1
in 0
real 0
life 0
pitting 0
refugee 0
war 0
criminals 0
and 0
terrorists 0
against 0
bureaucrats 0
with 0
badges 0
who 0
are 0
used 0
to 0
telling 0
people 0
not 0
to 0
raise 0
their 0
voices. 0

Four 0
people 0
were 0
shot 0
dead 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
week 0
of 0
this 0
year. 0

One 0
man 0
died 0
after 0
picking 0
up 0
a 0
hand 0
grenade 0
outside 0
a 0
subway 0
station 0
in 0
a 0
suburb 0
of 0
Stockholm. 0

Law 0
and 0
order 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
major 0
issue 0
in 0
a 0
parliamentary 0
election 0
scheduled 0
for 0
September 0
with 0
the 0
populist, 0
opposition 0
Sweden 0
Democrats 0
linking 0
public 0
concern 0
about 0
the 0
rising 0
crime 0
rate 0
to 0
a 0
large 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
numbers 0
of 0
immigrants. 0

"It 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
my 0
first 0
option 0
to 0
bring 0
in 0
the 0
military, 0
but 0
I 0
am 0
prepared 0
to 0
do 0
whatever 0
is 0
necessary 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
that 0
serious, 0
organized 0
crime 0
is 0
stamped 1
out," 1
Lofven 0
told 0
news 0
agency 0
TT. 0

Bringing 0
in 0
the 0
military 0
comes 0
in 0
as 0
an 0
option 0
ahead 0
of 0
cutting 0
migration 0
to 0
Sweden. 1

That 1
tells 1
you 1
everything. 1

Why 0
would 0
anyone 0
associate 0
rising 0
crime 0
and 0
immigration? 0

Maybe 0
because 0
the 0
gangs 0
in 0
question 0
are 0
immigrant 0
gangs. 0

The 0
government 0
has 0
promised 0
police 0
an 0
extra 0
7.1 0
billion 0
crowns 0
($880 0
million) 0
through 0
2020, 0
toughened 0
laws 0
on 0
gun 0
crimes 0
and 0
made 0
it 0
easier 0
for 0
the 0
police 0
to 0
monitor 0
private 0
phone 0
calls 0
and 0
emails, 0
among 0
other 0
measures. 0

Sound 0
familiar? 0

Mass 1
repression 1
and 1
police 1
powers 1
that 1
don't 1
actually 1
address 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
the 1
problem. 1

Meanwhile 0
the 0
Grenade 0
Amnesty 0
doesn't 0
seem 0
to 0
have 0
worked. 0

And 0
the 0
gang 0
violence 0
keeps 0
rising. 0

But 0
who 0
are 0
these 0
gangs? 0

The 0
criminal 0
gang 0
Loyal 0
to 0
Familia 0
has 0
already 0
spread 0
across 0
Denmark 0
from 0
its 0
base 0
in 0
the 0
Nørrebro 0
district 0
of 0
Copenhagen 0
and 0
now 0
it 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
set 0
its 0
sights 0
on 0
Sweden. 0

Swedish 0
police 0
told 0
the 0
Danish 0
tabloid 0
Ekstra 0
Bladet 0
that 0
the 0
gang 0
is 0
trying 0
to 0
build 0
a 0
presence 0
in 0
both 0
Malmö 0
and 0
Helsingborg. 0

An 0
expansion 0
into 0
Malmö 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
recipe 0
for 0
increased 0
violence 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
gun 0
violence 0
claimed 0
the 0
lives 0
of 0
11 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
southern 0
Swedish 0
city 0
last 0
year. 0

The 0
gang's 0
leader, 0
Shuaib 0
Khan, 0
confirmed 0
that 0
the 0
group 0
is 0
eyeing 0
the 0
two 0
Swedish 0
cities 0
but 0
denied 0
that 0
Loyal 0
to 0
Familia 0
was 0
a 0
“criminal 0
gang”. 0

Just 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
Danish 0
gangs 0
led 0
by 0
a 0
fellow 0
named 0
Khan. 0

Former 0

Accuses 0

of 0
McCarrick 0
Cover-up, 0
Calls 0
on 0
Francis 0
to 0
Resign 0

In 0
this 0
tragic 1
moment 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
various 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world 0
— 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Chile, 0
Honduras, 0
Australia, 0
etc. 0

— 0
bishops 0
have 0
a 0
very 1
grave 1
responsibility. 0

I 0
am 0
thinking 0
in 0
particular 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America, 0
where 0
I 0
was 0
sent 0
as 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
on 0
October 0
19, 0
2011, 0
the 0
memorial 0
feast 0
of 0
the 0
First 0
North 0
American 0
Martyrs. 0

The 0
Bishops 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
are 0
called, 0
and 0
I 0
with 0
them, 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
example 0
of 0
these 0
first 0
martyrs 0
who 0
brought 0
the 0
Gospel 0
to 0
the 0
lands 0
of 0
America, 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
witnesses 0
of 0
the 0
immeasurable 0
love 0
of 0
Christ, 0
the 0
Way, 0
the 0
Truth 0
and 0
the 0
Life. 0

Also, 0
as 0
this 0
is 0
an 0
unprecedented 0
moment 0
in 0
papal 0
history, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
unprecedented 0
step 0
of 0
recalling 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
to 0
the 0
Chair 0
of 0
St. 0
Peter 0
should 0
also 0
be 0
considered 0
sooner 0
rather 0
than 0
later, 0
before 1
this 1
crisis 1
gets 1
any 1
more 1
out-of-control 1
than 1
it 1
already 1
is. 1

May 0
God 0
save 0
His 0
Church 0
MJM 0

So 0
serious 0
is 0
the 0
cover-up 0
that 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
protection 0
of 0
the 0
faithful, 0
Archbishop 0
Vigano 0
has 0
called 0
on 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
resign. 0

But 0
before 0
Francis 0
resigns, 0
we 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
demand 0
that 0
he 0
also 0
remove 0
from 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals 0
those 0
who 0
conspired 0
even 0
before 0
the 0
2013 0
conclave 0
to 0
make 0
Jorge 0
Mario 0
Bergoglio 0
pope 0
come 0
hell 0
or 0
high 0
water. 0

He 0
and 0
the 0
St. 0
Gallen 0
Group 0
know 0
exactly 0
who 0
they 0
are. 0

Archbishop 0
Carlo 0
Maria 0
Viganò's 0
11-page 0
statement, 0
released 0
to 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register, 0
accuses 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
of 0
covering 0
for 0
McCarrick, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
sanctions 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
imposed 0
on 0
McCarrick, 0
and 0
also 0
of 0
making 0
McCarrick 0
a 0
trusted 0
counselor 0
who 0
became 0
Francis's 0
"kingmaker" 0
when 0
it 0
came 0
to 0
American 0
appointments 0
and 0
was 0
highly 0
instrumental 0
in 0
the 0
Pope's 0
decision 0
to 0
elevate 0
far-Left 0
bishops 0
such 0
as 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
of 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Joseph 0
Tobin 0
of 0
Newark 0
to 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals. 0

Remnant 0
Editor's 0
Note: 0
This 0
could 0
well 0
mark 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
disastrous 1
pontificate 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

The 0
former 0
apostolic 0
nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
accused 0
Francis 0
of 0
repealing 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
on 0
then-Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
for 0
sexual 0
abuse. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
charge 0
most 1
serious, 1
perhaps 0
without 0
precedent 0
in 0
modern 0
times. 0

Bishops 0
and 0
priests, 0
abusing 0
their 0
authority, 0
have 0
committed 0
horrendous 1
crimes 0
to 0
the 0
detriment 0
of 0
their 0
faithful, 0
minors, 0
innocent 0
victims, 0
and 0
young 0
men 0
eager 0
to 0
offer 0
their 0
lives 0
to 0
the 0
Church, 0
or 0
by 0
their 0
silence 0
have 0
not 0
prevented 0
that 0
such 0
crimes 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
perpetrated. 0

To 0
restore 0
the 0
beauty 0
of 0
holiness 0
to 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
the 0
Bride 0
of 0
Christ, 0
which 0
is 0
terribly 1
disfigured 1
by 0
so 0
many 0
abominable 1
crimes, 1
and 0
if 0
we 0
truly 0
want 0
to 0
free 0
the 0
Church 0
from 0
the 0
fetid 0
swamp 0
into 0
which 0
she 0
has 0
fallen, 0
we 0
must 0
have 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
tear 0
down 0
the 0
culture 0
of 0
secrecy 0
and 0
publicly 0
confess 0
the 0
truths 0
we 0
have 0
kept 0
hidden. 0

We 1
must 1
tear 0
down 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
with 0
which 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests 0
have 0
protected 0
themselves 0
at 0
the 0
expense 0
of 0
their 0
faithful, 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
the 0
world 0
risks 0
making 0
the 0
Church 0
look 0
like 0
a 0
sect, 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
not 0
so 0
dissimilar 0
from 0
the 0
one 0
that 0
prevails 0
in 0
the 0
mafia. 0

“Whatever 0
you 0
have 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
dark 0
... 0
shall 0
be 0
proclaimed 0
from 0
the 0
housetops” 0
(Lk. 0

12:3). 0

I 0
had 0
always 0
believed 0
and 0
hoped 0
that 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
could 0
find 0
within 0
itself 0
the 0
spiritual 0
resources 0
and 0
strength 0
to 0
tell 0
the 0
whole 0
truth, 0
to 0
amend 0
and 0
to 0
renew 0
itself. 0

That 0
is 0
why, 0
even 0
though 0
I 0
had 0
repeatedly 0
been 0
asked 0
to 0
do 0
so, 0
I 0
always 0
avoided 0
making 0
statements 0
to 0
the 0
media, 0
even 0
when 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
my 0
right 0
to 0
do 0
so, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
defend 0
myself 0
against 0
the 0
calumnies 0
published 0
about 0
me, 0
even 0
by 0
high-ranking 0
prelates 0
of 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia. 0

But 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
corruption 0
has 0
reached 0
the 0
very 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
hierarchy, 0
my 0
conscience 0
dictates 0
that 0
I 0
reveal 0
those 0
truths 0
regarding 0
the 0
heart-breaking 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
Emeritus 0
of 0
Washington, 0
D.C., 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
which 0
I 0
came 0
to 0
know 0
in 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
duties 0
entrusted 0
to 0
me 0
by 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
as 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations, 0
from 0
1998 0
to 0
2009, 0

as 0

to 0
the 0
United 0

of 0
America, 0
from 0
October 0
19, 0
2011 0

2016. 0

As 0

also 0
included 0

and 0
the 0
examination 0
of 0
delicate 0
cases, 0
including 0
those 0
regarding 0
cardinals 0
and 0
bishops, 0
that 0
were 0
entrusted 0
to 0
the 0
Delegate 0
by 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
or 0
by 0
the 0
Substitute 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State. 0

To 0
dispel 0
suspicions 0
insinuated 0
in 0
several 0
recent 0
articles, 0
I 0
will 0
immediately 0
say 0
that 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncios 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Gabriel 0
Montalvo 0
and 0
Pietro 0
Sambi, 0
both 0
prematurely 0
deceased, 0
did 0
not 0
fail 0
to 0
inform 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
immediately, 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
they 0
learned 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick’s 0
gravely 1
immoral 1
behavior 1
with 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests. 0

Indeed, 0
according 0
to 0
what 0
Nuncio 0
Pietro 0
Sambi 0
wrote, 0
Father 0
Boniface 0
Ramsey, 0
O.P.’s 0
letter, 0
dated 0
November 0
22, 0
2000, 0
was 0
written 0
at 0
the 0
request 0
of 0
the 0
late 0
Nuncio 0
Montalvo. 0

In 0
the 0
letter, 0
Father 0
Ramsey, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
professor 0
at 0
the 0
diocesan 0
seminary 0
in 0
Newark 0
from 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
’80s 0
until 0
1996, 0
affirms 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
recurring 0
rumor 0
in 0
the 0
seminary 0
that 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
“shared 0
his 0
bed 0
with 0
seminarians,” 0
inviting 0
five 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
to 0
spend 0
the 0
weekend 0
with 0
him 0
at 0
his 0
beach 0
house. 0

And 0
he 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
a 0
certain 0
number 0
of 0
seminarians, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
were 0
later 0
ordained 0
priests 0
for 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
Newark, 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
invited 0
to 0
this 0
beach 0
house 0
and 0
had 0
shared 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
the 0
Archbishop. 0

The 0
office 0
that 0
I 0
held 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
was 0
not 0
informed 0
of 0
any 0
measure 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
after 0
those 0
charges 0
were 0
brought 0
by 0
Nuncio 0
Montalvo 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
2000, 0
when 0
Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
was 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

Likewise, 0
Nuncio 0
Sambi 0
transmitted 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
an 0
Indictment 0
Memorandum 0
against 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
the 0
priest 0
Gregory 0
Littleton 0
of 0
the 0
diocese 0
of 0
Charlotte, 0
who 0
was 0
reduced 0
to 0
the 0
lay 0
state 0
for 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
minors, 0
together 0
with 0
two 0
documents 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
Littleton, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
recounted 0
his 0
tragic 1
story 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
the 0
then-Archbishop 0
of 0
Newark 0
and 0
several 0
other 0
priests 0
and 0
seminarians. 0

The 0
Nuncio 0
added 0
that 0
Littleton 0
had 0
already 0
forwarded 0
his 0
Memorandum 0
to 0
about 0
twenty 0
people, 0
including 0
civil 0
and 0
ecclesiastical 0
judicial 0
authorities, 0
police 0
and 0
lawyers, 0
in 0
June 0
2006, 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
therefore 0
very 0
likely 0
that 0
the 0
news 0
would 0
soon 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

He 0
therefore 0
called 0
for 0
a 0
prompt 0
intervention 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

In 0
writing 0
up 0
a 0
memo[1] 0
on 0
these 0
documents 0
that 0
were 0
entrusted 0
to 0
me, 0
as 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations, 0
on 0
December 0
6, 0
2006, 0
I 0
wrote 0
to 0
my 0
superiors, 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone 0
and 0
the 0
Substitute 0
Leonardo 0
Sandri, 0
that 0
the 0
facts 0
attributed 0
to 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
Littleton 0
were 0
of 0
such 0
gravity 0
and 0
vileness 0
as 0
to 0
provoke 0
bewilderment, 0
a 0
sense 0
of 0
disgust, 1
deep 1
sorrow 1
and 0
bitterness 0
in 0
the 0
reader, 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
constituted 0
the 0
crimes 0
of 0
seducing, 0
requesting 0
depraved 0
acts 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests, 0
repeatedly 0
and 0
simultaneously 0
with 0
several 0
people, 0
derision 0
of 0
a 0
young 0
seminarian 0
who 0
tried 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
Archbishop’s 0
seductions 0
in 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
two 0
other 0
priests, 0
absolution 0
of 0
the 0
accomplices 0
in 0
these 0
depraved 0
acts, 0
sacrilegious 0
celebration 0
of 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
priests 0
after 0
committing 0
such 0
acts. 0

In 0
my 0
memo, 0
which 0
I 0
delivered 0
on 0
that 0
same 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
to 0
my 0
direct 0
superior, 0
the 0
Substitute 0
Leonardo 0
Sandri, 0
I 0
proposed 0
the 0
following 0
considerations 0
and 0
course 0
of 0
action 0
to 0
my 0
superiors: 0

- 0
Given 0
that 0
it 0
seemed 0
a 0
new 0
scandal 0
of 0
particular 0
gravity, 0
as 0
it 0
regarded 0
a 0
cardinal, 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
added 0
to 0
the 0
many 0
scandals 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0

- 0
and 0
that, 0
since 0
this 0
matter 0
had 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
a 0
cardinal, 0
and 0
according 0
to 0
can. 0

1405 0
§ 0
1, 0
No. 0

2˚, 0
“ipsius 0
Romani 0
Pontificis 0
dumtaxat 0
ius 0
est 0
iudicandi”; 0

- 0
I 0
proposed 0
that 0
an 0
exemplary 0
measure 0
be 0
taken 0
against 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
that 0
could 0
have 0
a 0
medicinal 0
function, 0
to 0
prevent 0
future 0
abuses 0
against 0
innocent 0
victims 0
and 0
alleviate 0
the 0
very 0
serious 0
scandal 0
for 0
the 0
faithful, 0
who 0
despite 0
everything 0
continued 0
to 0
love 0
and 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

I 0
added 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
salutary 0
if, 0
for 0
once, 0
ecclesiastical 0
authority 0
would 0
intervene 0
before 0
the 0
civil 0
authorities 0
and, 0
if 0
possible, 0
before 0
the 0
scandal 0
had 0
broken 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
press. 0

This 0
could 0
have 0
restored 0
some 0
dignity 0
to 0
a 0
Church 0
so 0
sorely 0
tried 0
and 0
humiliated 0
by 0
so 0
many 0
abominable 0
acts 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
some 0
pastors. 0

If 0
this 0
were 0
done, 0
the 0
civil 0
authority 0
would 0
no 0
longer 0
have 0
to 0
judge 0
a 0
cardinal, 0
but 0
a 0
pastor 0
with 0
whom 0
the 0
Church 0
had 0
already 0
taken 0
appropriate 0
measures 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
cardinal 0
from 0
abusing 0
his 0
authority 0
and 0
continuing 0
to 0
destroy 1
innocent 0
victims. 0

My 0
memo 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
was 0
kept 0
by 0
my 0
superiors, 0
and 0
was 0
never 0
returned 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
any 0
actual 0
decision 0
by 0
the 0
superiors 0
on 0
this 0
matter. 0

Subsequently, 0
around 0
April 0
21-23, 0
2008, 0
the 0
Statement 0
for 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
about 0
the 0
pattern 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
by 0
Richard 0
Sipe, 0
was 0
published 0
on 0
the 0
internet, 0
at 0
richardsipe.com. 0

On 0
April 0
24, 0
it 0
was 0
passed 0
on 0
by 0
the 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
Cardinal 0
William 0
Levada, 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone. 0

It 0
was 0
delivered 0
to 0
me 0
one 0
month 0
later, 0
on 0
May 0
24, 0
2008. 0

The 0
following 0
day, 0
I 0
delivered 0
a 0
new 0
memo 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Substitute, 0
Fernando 0
Filoni, 0
which 0
included 0
my 0
previous 0
one 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006. 0

In 0
it, 0
I 0
summarized 0
Richard 0
Sipe’s 0
document, 0
which 0
ended 0
with 0
this 0
respectful 0
and 0
heartfelt 0
appeal 0
to 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI: 0
“I 0
approach 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
with 0
due 0
reverence, 0
but 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
intensity 0
that 0
motivated 0
Peter 0
Damian 0
to 0
lay 0
out 0
before 0
your 0
predecessor, 0
Pope 0
Leo 0
IX, 0
a 0
description 0
of 0
the 0
condition 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
during 0
his 0
time. 0

The 0
problems 0
he 0
spoke 0
of 0
are 0
similar 0
and 0
as 0
great 0
now 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
as 0
they 0
were 0
then 0
in 0
Rome. 0

If 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
requests, 0
I 0
will 0
personally 0
submit 0
to 0
you 0
documentation 0
of 0
that 0
about 0
which 0
I 0
have 0
spoken.” 0

I 0
ended 0
my 0
memo 0
by 0
repeating 0
to 0
my 0
superiors 0
that 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
necessary 0
to 0
intervene 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible 0
by 0
removing 0
the 0
cardinal’s 0
hat 0
from 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
subjected 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
established 0
by 0
the 0
Code 0
of 0
Canon 0
Law, 0
which 0
also 0
provide 0
for 0
reduction 0
to 0
the 0
lay 0
state. 0

This 0
second 0
memo 0
of 0
mine 0
was 0
also 0
never 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
Personnel 0
Office, 0
and 0
I 0
was 0
greatly 1
dismayed 1
at 0
my 0
superiors 0
for 0
the 0
inconceivable 0
absence 0
of 0
any 0
measure 0
against 0
the 0
Cardinal, 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
continuing 0
lack 0
of 0
any 0
communication 0
with 0
me 0
since 0
my 0
first 0
memo 0
in 0
December 0
2006. 0

But 0
finally 0
I 0
learned 0
with 0
certainty, 0
through 0
Cardinal 0
Giovanni 0
Battista 0
Re, 0
then-Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
that 0
Richard 0
Sipe’s 0
courageous 1
and 1
meritorious 1
Statement 0
had 0
had 0
the 0
desired 0
result. 0

Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
imposed 0
on 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
sanctions 0
similar 0
to 0
those 0
now 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
by 0
Pope 0
Francis: 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
was 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
seminary 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
living, 0
he 0
was 0
forbidden 0
to 0
celebrate 0
[Mass] 0
in 0
public, 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
public 0
meetings, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures, 0
to 0
travel, 0
with 0
the 0
obligation 0
of 0
dedicating 0
himself 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
when 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
took 0
these 0
measures 0
against 0
McCarrick, 0
whether 0
in 0
2009 0
or 0
2010, 0
because 0
in 0
the 0
meantime 0
I 0
had 0
been 0
transferred 0
to 0
the 0
Governorate 0
of 0
Vatican 0
City 0
State, 0
just 0
as 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
who 0
was 0
responsible 0
for 0
this 0
incredible 1
delay. 0

I 0
certainly 0
do 0
not 0
believe 0
it 0
was 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
who 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
had 0
repeatedly 0
denounced 0
the 0
corruption 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
months 0
of 0
his 0
pontificate 0
had 0
already 0
taken 0
a 0
firm 0
stand 0
against 0
the 0
admission 0
into 0
seminary 0
of 0
young 0
men 0
with 0
deep 0
homosexual 0
tendencies. 0

I 0
believe 0
it 0
was 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
first 0
collaborator 0
at 0
the 0
time, 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
who 0
notoriously 0
favored 0
promoting 0
homosexuals 0
into 0
positions 0
of 0
responsibility, 0
and 0
was 0
accustomed 0
to 0
managing 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
thought 0
appropriate 0
to 0
convey 0
to 0
the 0
Pope. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
what 0
is 0
certain 0
is 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
imposed 0
the 0
above 0
canonical 0
sanctions 0
on 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
communicated 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Pietro 0
Sambi. 0

Monsignor 0
Jean-François 0
Lantheaume, 0
then 0
first 0
Counsellor 0
of 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
Chargé 0
d'Affaires 0
a.i. 0

after 0
the 0
unexpected 0
death 0
of 0
Nuncio 0
Sambi 0
in 0
Baltimore, 0
told 0
me 0
when 0
I 0
arrived 0
in 0
Washington 0
— 0
and 0
he 0
is 0
ready 0
to 0
testify 0
to 0
it— 0
about 0
a 0
stormy 0
conversation, 0
lasting 0
over 0
an 0
hour, 0
that 0
Nuncio 0
Sambi 0
had 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
whom 0
he 0
had 0
summoned 0
to 0
the 0
Nunciature. 0

Monsignor 0
Lantheaume 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
“the 0
Nuncio’s 0
voice 0
could 0
be 0
heard 0
all 0
the 0
way 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
corridor.” 0

Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
same 0
dispositions 0
were 0
then 0
also 0
communicated 0
to 0
me 0
by 0
the 0
new 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
Cardinal 0
Marc 0
Ouellet, 0
in 0
November 0
2011, 0
in 0
a 0
conversation 0
before 0
my 0
departure 0
for 0
Washington, 0
and 0
were 0
included 0
among 0
the 0
instructions 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
Nuncio. 0

In 0
turn, 0
I 0
repeated 0
them 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
at 0
my 0
first 0
meeting 0
with 0
him 0
at 0
the 0
Nunciature. 0

The 0
Cardinal, 0
muttering 0
in 0
a 0
barely 0
comprehensible 0
way, 0
admitted 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
perhaps 0
made 0
the 0
mistake 0
of 0
sleeping 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
bed 0
with 0
some 0
seminarians 0
at 0
his 0
beach 0
house, 0
but 0
he 0
said 0
this 0
as 0
if 0
it 0
had 0
no 0
importance. 0

The 0
faithful 0
insistently 0
wonder 0
how 0
it 0
was 0
possible 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
be 0
appointed 0
to 0
Washington, 0
and 0
as 0
Cardinal, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
every 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
who 0
knew, 0
and 0
who 0
covered 0
up 0
his 0
grave 1
misdeeds. 1

It 0
is 0
therefore 0
my 0
duty 0
to 0
reveal 0
what 0
I 0
know 0
about 0
this, 0
beginning 0
with 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia. 0

Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Sodano 0
was 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
until 0
September 0
2006: 0
all 0
information 0
was 0
communicated 0
to 0
him. 0

In 0
November 0
2000, 0
Nunzio 0
Montalvo 0
sent 0
him 0
his 0
report, 0
passing 0
on 0
to 0
him 0
the 0
aforementioned 0
letter 0
from 0
Father 0
Boniface 0
Ramsey 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
denounced 0
the 0
serious 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

It 0
is 0
known 0
that 0
Sodano 0
tried 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
the 0
Father 0
Maciel 0
scandal 0
to 0
the 0
end. 0

He 0
even 0
removed 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
in 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
Justo 0
Mullor, 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
accomplice 0
in 0
his 0
scheme 0
to 0
cover 0
Maciel, 0
and 0
in 0
his 0
place 0
appointed 0
Sandri, 0
then-Nuncio 0
to 0
Venezuela, 0
who 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
collaborate 0
in 0
the 0
cover-up. 0

Sodano 0
even 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
issue 0
a 0
statement 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican 0
press 0
office 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
falsehood 0
was 0
affirmed, 0
that 0
is, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
decided 0
that 0
the 0
Maciel 0
case 0
should 0
be 0
considered 0
closed. 0

Benedict 0
reacted, 0
despite 0
Sodano’s 0
strenuous 0
defense, 0
and 0
Maciel 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
and 0
irrevocably 0
condemned. 0

Was 0
McCarrick’s 0
appointment 0
to 0
Washington 0
and 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
the 0
work 0
of 0
Sodano, 0
when 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
was 0
already 0
very 0
ill? 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
given 0
to 0
know. 0

However, 0
it 0
is 0
legitimate 0
to 0
think 0
so, 0
but 0
I 0
do 0
not 0
think 0
he 0
was 0
the 0
only 0
one 0
responsible 0
for 0
this. 0

McCarrick 0
frequently 0
went 0
to 0
Rome 0
and 0
made 0
friends 0
everywhere, 0
at 0
all 0
levels 0
of 0
the 0
Curia. 0

If 0
Sodano 0
had 0
protected 0
Maciel, 0
as 0
seems 0
certain, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
reason 0
why 0
he 0
wouldn’t 0
have 0
done 0
so 0
for 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
according 0
to 0
many 0
had 0
the 0
financial 0
means 0
to 0
influence 0
decisions. 0

His 0
nomination 0
to 0
Washington 0
was 0
opposed 0
by 0
then-Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
Cardinal 0
Giovanni 0
Battista 0
Re. 0

At 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
note, 0
written 0
in 0
his 0
hand, 0
in 0
which 0
Cardinal 0
Re 0
disassociates 0
himself 0
from 0
the 0
appointment 0
and 0
states 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
14th 0
on 0
the 0
list 0
for 0
Washington. 0

Nuncio 0
Sambi’s 0
report, 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
attachments, 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Tarcisio 0
Bertone, 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

My 0
two 0
above-mentioned 0
memos 0
of 0
December 0
6, 0
2006 0
and 0
May 0
25, 0
2008, 0
were 0
also 0
presumably 0
handed 0
over 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
the 0
Substitute. 0

As 0
already 0
mentioned, 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
had 0
no 0
difficulty 0
in 0
insistently 0
presenting 0
for 0
the 0
episcopate 0
candidates 0
known 0
to 0
be 0
active 0
homosexuals 0
— 0
I 0
cite 0
only 0
the 0
well-known 0
case 0
of 0
Vincenzo 0
de 0
Mauro, 0
who 0
was 0
appointed 0
Archbishop-Bishop 0
of 0
Vigevano 0
and 0
later 0
removed 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
undermining 0
his 0
seminarians 0
— 0
and 0
in 0
filtering 0
and 0
manipulating 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
conveyed 0
to 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

Cardinal 0
Pietro 0
Parolin, 0
the 0
current 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State, 0
was 0
also 0
complicit 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
misdeeds 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
who 0
had, 0
after 0
the 0
election 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
boasted 0
openly 0
of 0
his 0
travels 0
and 0
missions 0
to 0
various 0
continents. 0

In 0
April 0
2014, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Times 0
had 0
a 0
front 0
page 0
report 0
on 0
McCarrick’s 0
trip 0
to 0
the 0
Central 0
African 0
Republic, 0
and 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
no 0
less. 0

As 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
Washington, 0
I 0
wrote 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin 0
asking 0
him 0
if 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
McCarrick 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
were 0
still 0
valid. 0

Ça 0
va 0
sans 0
dire 0
that 0
my 0
letter 0
never 0
received 0
any 0
reply! 0

The 0
same 0
can 0
be 0
said 0
for 0
Cardinal 0
William 0
Levada, 0
former 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
for 0
Cardinals 0
Marc 0
Ouellet, 0
Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
Lorenzo 0
Baldisseri, 0
former 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
and 0
Archbishop 0
Ilson 0
de 0
Jesus 0
Montanari, 0
current 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation. 0

They 0
were 0
all 0
aware 0
by 0
reason 0
of 0
their 0
office 0
of 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
on 0
McCarrick. 0

Cardinals 0
Leonardo 0
Sandri, 0
Fernando 0
Filoni 0
and 0
Angelo 0
Becciu, 0
as 0
Substitutes 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State, 0
knew 0
in 0
every 0
detail 0
the 0
situation 0
regarding 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

Nor 0
could 0
Cardinals 0
Giovanni 0
Lajolo 0
and 0
Dominique 0
Mamberti 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
know. 0

As 0
Secretaries 0
for 0
Relations 0
with 0
States, 0
they 0
participated 0
several 0
times 0
a 0
week 0
in 0
collegial 0
meetings 0
with 0
the 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State. 0

As 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
Roman 0
Curia 0
is 0
concerned, 0
for 0
the 0
moment 0
I 0
will 0
stop 0
here, 0
even 0
if 0
the 0
names 0
of 0
other 0
prelates 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
are 0
well 0
known, 0
even 0
some 0
very 0
close 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
such 0
as 0
Cardinal 0
Francesco 0
Coccopalmerio 0
and 0
Archbishop 0
Vincenzo 0
Paglia, 0
who 0
belong 0
to 0
the 0
homosexual 0
current 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
subverting 0
Catholic 0
doctrine 0
on 0
homosexuality, 0
a 0
current 0
already 0
denounced 0
in 0
1986 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Joseph 0
Ratzinger, 0
then-Prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith, 0
in 0
the 0
Letter 0
to 0
the 0
Bishops 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
on 0
the 0
Pastoral 0
Care 0
of 0
Homosexual 0
Persons. 0

Cardinals 0
Edwin 0
Frederick 0
O’Brien 0
and 0
Renato 0
Raffaele 0
Martino 0
also 0
belong 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
current, 0
albeit 0
with 0
a 0
different 0
ideology. 0

Others 0
belonging 0
to 0
this 0
current 0
even 0
reside 0
at 0
the 0
Domus 0
Sanctae 0
Marthae. 0

Now 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Obviously, 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
informed 0
of 0
the 0
measures 0
taken 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
was 0
McCarrick’s 0
successor 0
in 0
Washington 0
See, 0
Cardinal 0
Donald 0
Wuerl, 0
whose 0
situation 0
is 0
now 0
completely 0
compromised 0
by 0
the 0
recent 0
revelations 0
regarding 0
his 0
behavior 0
as 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Pittsburgh. 0

It 0
is 0
absolutely 0
unthinkable 0
that 0
Nunzio 0
Sambi, 0
who 0
was 0
an 0
extremely 0
responsible 0
person, 0
loyal, 0
direct 0
and 0
explicit 0
in 0
his 0
way 0
of 0
being 0
(a 0
true 0
son 0
of 0
Romagna) 0
did 0
not 0
speak 0
to 0
him 0
about 0
it. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
I 0
myself 0
brought 0
up 0
the 0
subject 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
on 0
several 0
occasions, 0
and 0
I 0
certainly 0
didn’t 0
need 0
to 0
go 0
into 0
detail 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
immediately 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
fully 0
aware 0
of 0
it. 0

I 0
also 0
remember 0
in 0
particular 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
to 0
draw 0
his 0
attention 0
to 0
it, 0
because 0
I 0
realized 0
that 0
in 0
an 0
archdiocesan 0
publication, 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
cover 0
in 0
color, 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
announcement 0
inviting 0
young 0
men 0
who 0
thought 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
vocation 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

I 0
immediately 0
phoned 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
who 0
expressed 0
his 0
surprise 0
to 0
me, 0
telling 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
that 0
announcement 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
cancel 0
it. 0

If, 0
as 0
he 0
now 0
continues 0
to 0
state, 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
of 0
the 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
measures 0
taken 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
how 0
can 0
his 0
answer 0
be 0
explained? 0

His 0
recent 0
statements 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it, 0
even 0
though 0
at 0
first 0
he 0
cunningly 0
referred 0
to 0
compensation 0
for 0
the 0
two 0
victims, 0
are 0
absolutely 1
laughable. 1

The 0
Cardinal 0
lies 0
shamelessly 1
and 0
prevails 0
upon 0
his 0
Chancellor, 0
Monsignor 0
Antonicelli, 0
to 0
lie 0
as 0
well. 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
also 0
clearly 0
lied 0
on 0
another 0
occasion. 0

Following 0
a 0
morally 0
unacceptable 0
event 0
authorized 0
by 0
the 0
academic 0
authorities 0
of 0
Georgetown 0
University, 0
I 0
brought 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
its 0
President, 0
Dr. 0
John 0
DeGioia, 0
sending 0
him 0
two 0
subsequent 0
letters. 0

Before 0
forwarding 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
addressee, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
handle 0
things 0
properly, 0
I 0
personally 0
gave 0
a 0
copy 0
of 0
them 0
to 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
with 0
an 0
accompanying 0
letter 0
I 0
had 0
written. 0

The 0
Cardinal 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it. 0

However, 0
he 0
failed 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
receipt 0
of 0
my 0
two 0
letters, 0
contrary 0
to 0
what 0
he 0
customarily 0
did. 0

I 0
subsequently 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
event 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
had 0
taken 0
place 0
for 0
seven 0
years. 0

But 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
knew 0
nothing 0
about 0
it! 0

Cardinal 0
Wuerl, 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
continuous 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
the 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
transgressing 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
order, 0
also 0
allowed 0
him 0
to 0
reside 0
at 0
a 0
seminary 0
in 0
Washington 0
D.C. 0

In 0
doing 0
so, 0
he 0
put 0
other 0
seminarians 0
at 0
risk. 0

Bishop 0
Paul 0
Bootkoski, 0
emeritus 0
of 0
Metuchen, 0
and 0
Archbishop 0
John 0
Myers, 0
emeritus 0
of 0
Newark, 0
covered 0
up 0
the 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick 0
in 0
their 0
respective 0
dioceses 0
and 0
compensated 0
two 0
of 0
his 0
victims. 0

They 0
cannot 0
deny 0
it 0
and 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
interrogated 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
reveal 0
every 0
circumstance 0
and 0
all 0
responsibility 0
regarding 0
this 0
matter. 0

Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
who 0
was 0
recently 0
interviewed 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
have 0
the 0
slightest 0
idea 0
about 0
the 0
abuses 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

Given 0
his 0
tenure 0
in 0
Washington, 0
Dallas 0
and 0
now 0
Rome, 0
I 0
think 0
no 0
one 0
can 0
honestly 0
believe 0
him. 0

I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
he 0
was 0
ever 0
asked 0
if 0
he 0
knew 0
about 0
Maciel’s 0
crimes. 0

If 0
he 0
were 0
to 0
deny 0
this, 0
would 0
anybody 0
believe 0
him 0
given 0
that 0
he 0
occupied 0
positions 0
of 0
responsibility 0
as 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Legionaries 0
of 0
Christ? 0

Regarding 0
Cardinal 0
Sean 0
O’Malley, 0
I 0
would 0
simply 0
say 0
that 0
his 0
latest 0
statements 0
on 0
the 0
McCarrick 0
case 0
are 0
disconcerting, 1
and 0
have 0
totally 1
obscured 0
his 0
transparency 0
and 0
credibility. 0

* 0
* 0
* 0

My 0
conscience 0
requires 0
me 0
also 0
to 0
reveal 0
facts 0
that 0
I 0
have 0
experienced 0
personally, 0
concerning 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
that 0
have 0
a 0
dramatic 1
significance, 0
which 0
as 0
Bishop, 0
sharing 0
the 0
collegial 0
responsibility 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
bishops 0
for 0
the 0
universal 0
Church, 0
do 0
not 0
allow 0
me 0
to 0
remain 0
silent, 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
state 0
here, 0
ready 0
to 0
reaffirm 0
them 0
under 0
oath 0
by 0
calling 0
on 0
God 0
as 0
my 0
witness. 0

In 0
the 0
last 0
months 0
of 0
his 0
pontificate, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
had 0
convened 0
a 0
meeting 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
apostolic 0
nuncios 0
in 0
Rome, 0
as 0
Paul 0
VI 0
and 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
had 0
done 0
on 0
several 0
occasions. 0

The 0
date 0
set 0
for 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
the 0
Pope 0
was 0
Friday, 0
June 0
21, 0
2013. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
kept 0
this 0
commitment 0
made 0
by 0
his 0
predecessor. 0

Of 0
course 0
I 0
also 0
came 0
to 0
Rome 0
from 0
Washington. 0

It 0
was 0
my 0
first 0
meeting 0
with 0
the 0
new 0
Pope 0
elected 0
only 0
three 0
months 0
prior, 0
after 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict. 0

On 0
the 0
morning 0
of 0
Thursday, 0
June 0
20, 0
2013, 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
Domus 0
Sanctae 0
Marthae, 0
to 0
join 0
my 0
colleagues 0
who 0
were 0
staying 0
there. 0

As 0
soon 0
as 0
I 0
entered 0
the 0
hall 0
I 0
met 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
wore 0
the 0
red-trimmed 0
cassock. 0

I 0
greeted 0
him 0
respectfully 0
as 0
I 0
had 0
always 0
done. 0

He 0
immediately 0
said 0
to 0
me, 0
in 0
a 0
tone 0
somewhere 0
between 0
ambiguous 0
and 0
triumphant: 0
“The 0
Pope 0
received 0
me 0
yesterday, 0
tomorrow 0
I 0
am 0
going 0
to 0
China.” 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
I 0
knew 0
nothing 0
of 0
his 0
long 0
friendship 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Bergoglio 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
important 0
part 0
he 0
had 0
played 0
in 0
his 0
recent 0
election, 0
as 0
McCarrick 0
himself 0
would 0
later 0
reveal 0
in 0
a 0
lecture 0
at 0
Villanova 0
University 0
and 0
in 0
an 0
interview 0
with 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter. 0

Nor 0
had 0
I 0
ever 0
thought 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
participated 0
in 0
the 0
preliminary 0
meetings 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
conclave, 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
role 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
able 0
to 0
have 0
as 0
a 0
cardinal 0
elector 0
in 0
the 0
2005 0
conclave. 0

Therefore 0
I 0
did 0
not 0
immediately 0
grasp 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
the 0
encrypted 0
message 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
communicated 0
to 0
me, 0
but 0
that 0
would 0
become 0
clear 0
to 0
me 0
in 0
the 0
days 0
immediately 0
following. 0

The 0
next 0
day 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
took 0
place. 0

After 0
his 0
address, 0
which 0
was 0
partly 0
read 0
and 0
partly 0
delivered 0
off 0
the 0
cuff, 0
the 0
Pope 0
wished 0
to 0
greet 0
all 0
the 0
nuncios 0
one 0
by 0
one. 0

In 0
single 0
file, 0
I 0
remember 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
among 0
the 0
last. 0

When 0
it 0
was 0
my 0
turn, 0
I 0
just 0
had 0
time 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
him, 0
“I 0
am 0
the 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States.” 0
He 0
immediately 0
assailed 0
me 0
with 0
a 0
tone 0
of 0
reproach, 0
using 0
these 0
words: 0
“The 0
Bishops 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
ideologized! 0

They 0
must 0
be 0
shepherds!”Of 0
course 0
I 0
was 0
not 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
explanations 0
about 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
his 0
words 0
and 0
the 0
aggressive 1
way 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
had 0
upbraided 0
me. 0

I 0
had 0
in 0
my 0
hand 0
a 0
book 0
in 0
Portuguese 0
that 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
had 0
sent 0
me 0
for 0
the 0
Pope 0
a 0
few 0
days 0
earlier, 0
telling 0
me 0
“so 0
he 0
could 0
go 0
over 0
his 0
Portuguese 0
before 0
going 0
to 0
Rio 0
for 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day.” 0
I 0
handed 0
it 0
to 0
him 0
immediately, 0
and 0
so 0
freed 0
myself 0
from 0
that 0
extremely 0
disconcerting 0
and 0
embarrassing 0
situation. 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
audience 0
the 0
Pope 0
announced: 0
“Those 0
of 0
you 0
who 0
are 0
still 0
in 0
Rome 0
next 0
Sunday 0
are 0
invited 0
to 0
concelebrate 0
with 0
me 0
at 0
the 0
Domus 0
Sanctae 0
Marthae.” 0
I 0
naturally 0
thought 0
of 0
staying 0
on 0
to 0
clarify 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible 0
what 0
the 0
Pope 0
intended 0
to 0
tell 0
me. 0

On 0
Sunday 0
June 0
23, 0
before 0
the 0
concelebration 0
with 0
the 0
Pope, 0
I 0
asked 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca, 0
who 0
as 0
the 0
person 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
house 0
helped 0
us 0
put 0
on 0
the 0
vestments, 0
if 0
he 0
could 0
ask 0
the 0
Pope 0
if 0
he 0
could 0
receive 0
me 0
sometime 0
in 0
the 0
following 0
week. 0

How 0
could 0
I 0
have 0
returned 0
to 0
Washington 0
without 0
having 0
clarified 0
what 0
the 0
Pope 0
wanted 0
of 0
me? 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
Mass, 0
while 0
the 0
Pope 0
was 0
greeting 0
the 0
few 0
lay 0
people 0
present, 0
Monsignor 0
Fabian 0
Pedacchio, 0
his 0
Argentine 0
secretary, 0
came 0
to 0
me 0
and 0
said: 0
“The 0
Pope 0
told 0
me 0
to 0
ask 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
free 0
now!” 0
Naturally, 0
I 0
replied 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
disposal 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
thanked 0
him 0
for 0
receiving 0
me 0
immediately. 0

The 0
Pope 0
took 0
me 0
to 0
the 0
first 0
floor 0
in 0
his 0
apartment 0
and 0
said: 0
“We 0
have 0
40 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
Angelus.” 0

I 0
began 0
the 0
conversation, 0
asking 0
the 0
Pope 0
what 0
he 0
intended 0
to 0
say 0
to 0
me 0
with 0
the 0
words 0
he 0
had 0
addressed 0
to 0
me 0
when 0
I 0
greeted 0
him 0
the 0
previous 0
Friday. 0

And 0
the 0
Pope, 0
in 0
a 0
very 0
different, 0
friendly, 0
almost 0
affectionate 0
tone, 0
said 0
to 0
me: 0
“Yes, 0
the 0
Bishops 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
ideologized, 0
they 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
right-wing 0
like 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Philadelphia, 0
(the 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
give 0
me 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
Archbishop) 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
shepherds; 0
and 0
they 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
left-wing 0
— 0
and 0
he 0
added, 0
raising 0
both 0
arms 0
— 0
and 0
when 0
I 0
say 0
left-wing 0
I 0
mean 0
homosexual.” 0
Of 0
course, 0
the 0
logic 0
of 0
the 0
correlation 0
between 0
being 0
left-wing 0
and 0
being 0
homosexual 0
escaped 0
me, 0
but 0
I 0
added 0
nothing 0
else. 0

Immediately 0
after, 0
the 0
Pope 0
asked 0
me 0
in 0
a 0
deceitful 0
way: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
I 0
answered 0
him 0
with 0
complete 0
frankness 0
and, 0
if 0
you 0
want, 0
with 0
great 0
naiveté: 0
“Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
if 0
you 0
know 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick, 0
but 0
if 0
you 0
ask 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
dossier 0
this 0
thick 0
about 0
him. 0

He 0
corrupted 0
generations 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests 0
and 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
ordered 0
him 0
to 0
withdraw 0
to 0
a 0
life 0
of 0
prayer 0
and 0
penance.” 0
The 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
the 0
slightest 0
comment 0
about 0
those 0
very 1
grave 1
words 0
of 0
mine 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
any 0
expression 0
of 0
surprise 0
on 0
his 0
face, 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
known 0
the 0
matter 0
for 0
some 0
time, 0
and 0
he 0
immediately 0
changed 0
the 0
subject. 0

But 0
then, 0
what 0
was 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
purpose 0
in 0
asking 0
me 0
that 0
question: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
like?” 0
He 0
clearly 0
wanted 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
if 0
I 0
was 0
an 0
ally 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
or 0
not. 0

Back 0
in 0
Washington 0
everything 0
became 0
very 0
clear 0
to 0
me, 0
thanks 0
also 0
to 0
a 0
new 0
event 0
that 0
occurred 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
days 0
after 0
my 0
meeting 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

When 0
the 0
new 0
Bishop 0
Mark 0
Seitz 0
took 0
possession 0
of 0
the 0
Diocese 0
of 0
El 0
Paso 0
on 0
July 0
9, 0
2013, 0
I 0
sent 0
the 0
first 0
Counsellor, 0
Monsignor 0
Jean-François 0
Lantheaume, 0
while 0
I 0
went 0
to 0
Dallas 0
that 0
same 0
day 0
for 0
an 0
international 0
meeting 0
on 0
Bioethics. 0

When 0
he 0
got 0
back, 0
Monsignor 0
Lantheaume 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
in 0
El 0
Paso 0
he 0
had 0
met 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
who, 0
taking 0
him 0
aside, 0
told 0
him 0
almost 0
the 0
same 0
words 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
had 0
said 0
to 0
me 0
in 0
Rome: 0
“the 0
Bishops 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
ideologized, 0
they 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
right-wing, 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
shepherds….” 0
I 0
was 0
astounded! 0

It 0
was 0
therefore 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
reproach 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
had 0
addressed 0
to 0
me 0
on 0
June 0
21, 0
2013 0
had 0
been 0
put 0
into 0
his 0
mouth 0
the 0
day 0
before 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

Also 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
mention 0
“not 0
like 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Philadelphia” 0
could 0
be 0
traced 0
to 0
McCarrick, 0
because 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
strong 0
disagreement 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
of 0
them 0
about 0
the 0
admission 0
to 0
Communion 0
of 0
pro-abortion 0
politicians. 0

In 0
his 0
communication 0
to 0
the 0
bishops, 0
McCarrick 0
had 0
manipulated 0
a 0
letter 0
of 0
then-Cardinal 0
Ratzinger 0
who 0
prohibited 0
giving 0
them 0
Communion. 0

Indeed, 0
I 0
also 0
knew 0
how 0
certain 0
Cardinals 0
such 0
as 0
Mahony, 0
Levada 0
and 0
Wuerl, 0
were 0
closely 0
linked 0
to 0
McCarrick; 0
they 0
had 0
opposed 0
the 0
most 0
recent 0
appointments 0
made 0
by 0
Pope 0
Benedict, 0
for 0
important 0
posts 0
such 0
as 0
Philadelphia, 0
Baltimore, 0
Denver 0
and 0
San 0
Francisco. 0

Not 0
happy 0
with 0
the 0
trap 0
he 0
had 0
set 0
for 0
me 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013, 0
when 0
he 0
asked 0
me 0
about 0
McCarrick, 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
months 0
later, 0
in 0
the 0
audience 0
he 0
granted 0
me 0
on 0
October 0
10, 0
2013, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
set 0
a 0
second 0
one 0
for 0
me, 0
this 0
time 0
concerning 0
a 0
second 0
of 0
his 0
protégés, 0
Cardinal 0
Donald 0
Wuerl. 0

He 0
asked 0
me: 0
“What 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl 0
like, 0
is 0
he 0
good 0
or 0
bad?” 0
I 0
replied, 0
“Holy 0
Father, 0
I 0
will 0
not 0
tell 0
you 0
if 0
he 0
is 0
good 0
or 0
bad, 0
but 0
I 0
will 0
tell 0
you 0
two 0
facts.” 0
They 0
are 0
the 0
ones 0
I 0
have 0
already 0
mentioned 0
above, 0
which 0
concern 0
Wuerl’s 0
pastoral 1
carelessness 1
regarding 0
the 0
aberrant 0
deviations 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
University 0
and 0
the 0
invitation 0
by 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
Washington 0
to 0
young 0
aspirants 0
to 0
the 0
priesthood 0
to 0
a 0
meeting 0
with 0
McCarrick! 0

Once 0
again 0
the 0
Pope 0
did 0
not 0
show 0
any 0
reaction. 0

It 0
was 0
also 0
clear 0
that, 0
from 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
election, 0
McCarrick, 0
now 0
free 0
from 0
all 0
constraints, 0
had 0
felt 0
free 0
to 0
travel 0
continuously, 0
to 0
give 0
lectures 0
and 0
interviews. 0

In 0
a 0
team 0
effort 0
with 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
he 0
had 0
become 0
the 0
kingmaker 0
for 0
appointments 0
in 0
the 0
Curia 0
and 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
and 0
the 0
most 0
listened 0
to 0
advisor 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
for 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

This 0
is 0
how 0
one 0
explains 0
that, 0
as 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
the 0
Pope 0
replaced 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
with 0
Wuerl 0
and 0
immediately 0
appointed 0
Cupich 0
right 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
made 0
a 0
cardinal. 0

With 0
these 0
appointments 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
in 0
Washington 0
was 0
now 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
picture 0
in 0
the 0
appointment 0
of 0
bishops. 0

In 0
addition, 0
he 0
appointed 0
the 0
Brazilian 0
Ilson 0
de 0
Jesus 0
Montanari 0
— 0
the 0
great 0
friend 0
of 0
his 0
private 0
Argentine 0
secretary 0
Fabian 0
Pedacchio 0
— 0
as 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
and 0
Secretary 0
of 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals, 0
promoting 0
him 0
in 0
one 0
single 0
leap 0
from 0
a 0
simple 0
official 0
of 0
that 0
department 0
to 0
Archbishop 0
Secretary. 0

Something 0
unprecedented 1
for 0
such 0
an 0
important 0
position! 0

The 0
appointments 0
of 0
Blase 0
Cupich 0
to 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Joseph 0
W. 0
Tobin 0
to 0
Newark 0
were 0
orchestrated 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
Maradiaga 0
and 0
Wuerl, 0
united 0
by 0
a 0
wicked 1
pact 0
of 0
abuses 0
by 0
the 0
first, 0
and 0
at 0
least 0
of 0
coverup 0
of 0
abuses 0
by 0
the 0
other 0
two. 0

Their 0
names 0
were 0
not 0
among 0
those 0
presented 0
by 0
the 0
Nunciature 0
for 0
Chicago 0
and 0
Newark. 0

Regarding 0
Cupich, 0
one 0
cannot 0
fail 0
to 0
note 0
his 0
ostentatious 1
arrogance, 1
and 0
the 0
insolence 0
with 0
which 0
he 0
denies 0
the 0
evidence 0
that 0
is 0
now 0
obvious 0
to 0
all: 0
that 0
80% 0
of 0
the 0
abuses 0
found 0
were 0
committed 0
against 0
young 0
adults 0
by 0
homosexuals 0
who 0
were 0
in 0
a 0
relationship 0
of 0
authority 0
over 0
their 0
victims. 0

During 0
the 0
speech 0
he 0
gave 0
when 0
he 0
took 0
possession 0
of 0
the 0
Chicago 0
See, 0
at 0
which 0
I 0
was 0
present 0
as 0
a 0
representative 0
of 0
the 0
Pope, 0
Cupich 0
quipped 0
that 0
one 0
certainly 0
should 0
not 0
expect 0
the 0
new 0
Archbishop 0
to 0
walk 0
on 0
water. 0

Perhaps 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
enough 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
remain 0
with 0
his 0
feet 0
on 0
the 0
ground 0
and 0
not 0
try 0
to 0
turn 0
reality 0
upside-down, 0
blinded 0
by 0
his 0
pro-gay 0
ideology, 0
as 0
he 0
stated 0
in 0
a 0
recent 0
interview 0
with 0
America 0
Magazine. 0

Extolling 0
his 0
particular 0
expertise 0
in 0
the 0
matter, 0
having 0
been 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Committee 0
on 0
Protection 0
of 0
Children 0
and 0
Young 0
People 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
he 0
asserted 0
that 0
the 0
main 0
problem 0
in 0
the 0
crisis 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
clergy 0
is 0
not 0
homosexuality, 0
and 0
that 0
affirming 0
this 0
is 0
only 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
diverting 0
attention 0
from 0
the 0
real 0
problem 0
which 0
is 0
clericalism. 0

In 0
support 0
of 0
this 0
thesis, 0
Cupich 0
“oddly” 0
made 0
reference 0
to 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
research 0
carried 0
out 0
at 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
crisis 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
2000s, 0
while 0
he 0
“candidly” 0
ignored 0
that 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
that 0

were 0
totally 0

the 0
John 0
Jay 0
College 0
of 0
Criminal 0
Justice 0
in 0
2004 0
and 0
2011, 0
which 0
concluded 0
that, 0
in 0
cases 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse, 0
81% 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
were 0
male. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Father 0
Hans 0
Zollner, 0

Vice-Rector 0
of 0

Pontifical 0
Gregorian 0

and 0
Member 0
of 0
the 0

recently 0
told 0
the 0
newspaper 0
La 0
Stampa 0
that 0
“in 0
most 0
cases 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
question 0
of 0
homosexual 0
abuse.” 0

The 0
appointment 0
of 0
McElroy 0
in 0
San 0
Diego 0
was 0
also 0
orchestrated 0
from 0
above, 0
with 0
an 0
encrypted 0
peremptory 0
order 0
to 0
me 0
as 0
Nuncio, 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin: 0
“Reserve 0
the 0
See 0
of 0
San 0
Diego 0
for 0

McElroy 0
was 0
also 0
well 0
aware 0
of 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses, 0
as 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
from 0
a 0
letter 0
sent 0
to 0
him 0
by 0
Richard 0

These 0
characters 0
are 0
closely 0
associated 0
with 0
individuals 0
belonging 0
in 0
particular 0
to 0
the 0
deviated 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
Jesus, 0
unfortunately 0
today 0
a 0
majority, 0
which 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
a 0
cause 0
of 0
serious 0
concern 0
to 0
Paul 0
VI 0
and 0
subsequent 0
pontiffs. 0

We 0
need 0
only 0
consider 0
Father 0
Robert 0
Drinan, 0
S.J., 0
who 0
was 0
elected 0
four 0
times 0
to 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives, 0
and 0
was 0
a 0
staunch 0
supporter 0
of 0
abortion; 0
or 0
Father 0
Vincent 0
O’Keefe, 0
S.J., 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
principal 0
promoters 0
of 0
The 0
Land 0
O’Lakes 0
Statement 0
of 0
1967, 0
which 0
seriously 0
compromised 0
the 0
Catholic 0
identity 0
of 0
universities 0
and 0
colleges 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

It 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
McCarrick, 0
then 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
University 0
of 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
also 0
participated 0
in 0
that 0
inauspicious 0
undertaking 0
which 0
was 0
so 0
harmful 0
to 0
the 0
formation 0
of 0
the 0
consciences 0
of 0
American 0
youth, 0
closely 0
associated 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
with 0
the 0
deviated 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Jesuits. 0

Father 0
James 0
Martin, 0
S.J., 0
acclaimed 0
by 0
the 0
people 0
mentioned 0
above, 0
in 0
particular 0
Cupich, 0
Tobin, 0
Farrell 0
and 0
McElroy, 0
appointed 0
Consultor 0
of 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
for 0
Communications, 0
well-known 0
activist 0
who 0
promotes 0
the 0
LGBT 0
agenda, 0
chosen 0
to 0
corrupt 0
the 0
young 0
people 0
who 0
will 0
soon 0
gather 0
in 0
Dublin 0
for 0
the 0
World 0
Meeting 0
of 0
Families, 0
is 0
nothing 0
but 0
a 0
sad 0
recent 0
example 0
of 0
that 0
deviated 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Society 0
of 0
Jesus. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
asked 0
for 0
total 0
transparency 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
for 0
bishops 0
and 0
faithful 0
to 0
act 0
with 0
parrhesia. 0

The 0
faithful 0
throughout 0
the 0
world 0
also 0
demand 0
this 0
of 0
him 0
in 0
an 0
exemplary 0
manner. 0

He 0
must 0
honestly 0
state 0
when 0
he 0
first 0
learned 0
about 0
the 0
crimes 0
committed 0
by 0
McCarrick, 0
who 0
abused 0
his 0
authority 0
with 0
seminarians 0
and 0
priests. 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
the 0
Pope 0
learned 0
about 0
it 0
from 0
me 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
and 0
continued 0
to 0
cover 0
for 0
him. 0

He 0
did 0
not 0
take 0
into 0
account 0
the 0
sanctions 0
that 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
imposed 0
on 0
him 0
and 0
made 0
him 0
his 0
trusted 0
counselor 0
along 0
with 0
Maradiaga. 0

The 0
latter 0
[Maradiaga] 0
is 0
so 0
confident 0
of 0
the 0
Pope’s 0
protection 0
that 0
he 0
can 0
dismiss 0
as 0
“gossip” 0
the 0
heartfelt 0
appeals 0
of 0
dozens 0
of 0
his 0
seminarians, 0
who 0
found 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
write 0
to 0
him 0
after 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
tried 0
to 0
commit 0
suicide 0
over 0
homosexual 0
abuse 0
in 0
the 0
seminary. 0

By 0
now 0
the 0
faithful 0
have 0
well 0
understood 0
Maradiaga’s 0
strategy: 0
insult 0
the 0
victims 0
to 0
save 0
himself, 0
lie 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
a 0
chasm 0
of 0
abuses 0
of 0
power, 0
of 0
mismanagement 0
in 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Church 0
property, 0
and 0
of 0
financial 0
disasters 1
even 0
against 0
close 0
friends, 0
as 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Ambassador 0
of 0
Honduras 0
Alejandro 0
Valladares, 0
former 0
Dean 0
of 0
the 0
Diplomatic 0
Corps 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

In 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
former 0
Auxiliary 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
José 0
Pineda, 0
after 0
the 0
article 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
[Italian] 0
weekly 0
L’Espresso 0
last 0
February, 0
Maradiaga 0
stated 0
in 0
the 0
newspaper 0
Avvenire: 0
“It 0
was 0
my 0
auxiliary 0
bishop 0
Pineda 0
who 0
asked 0
for 0
the 0
visitation, 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
‘clear’ 0
his 0
name 0
after 0
being 0
subjected 0
to 0
much 0
slander.” 0
Now, 0
regarding 0
Pineda 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
public 0
is 0
that 0
his 0
resignation 0
has 0
simply 0
been 0
accepted, 0
thus 0
making 0
any 0
possible 0
responsibility 0
of 0
his 0
and 0
Maradiaga 0
vanish 0
into 0
nowhere. 0

In 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
the 0
transparency 0
so 0
hailed 0
by 0
the 0
Pope, 0
the 0
report 0
that 0
the 0
Visitator, 0
Argentine 0
bishop 0
Alcides 0
Casaretto, 0
delivered 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
ago 0
only 0
and 0
directly 0
to 0
the 0
Pope, 0
must 0
be 0
made 0
public. 0

Finally, 0
the 0
recent 0
appointment 0
as 0
Substitute 0
of 0
Archbishop 0
Edgar 0
Peña 0
Parra 0
is 0
also 0
connected 0
with 0
Honduras, 0
that 0
is, 0
with 0
Maradiaga. 0

From 0
2003 0
to 0
2007 0
Peña 0
Parra 0
worked 0
as 0
Counsellor 0
at 0
the 0
Tegucigalpa 0
Nunciature. 0

As 0
Delegate 0
for 0
Pontifical 0
Representations 0
I 0
received 0
worrisome 0
information 0
about 0
him. 0

In 0
Honduras, 0
a 0
scandal 0
as 0
huge 0
as 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
Chile 0
is 0
about 0
to 0
be 0
repeated. 0

The 0
Pope 0
defends 0
his 0
man, 0
Cardinal 0
Rodriguez 0
Maradiaga, 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end, 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
done 0
in 0
Chile 0
with 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
de 0
la 0
Cruz 0
Barros, 0
whom 0
he 0
himself 0
had 0
appointed 0
Bishop 0
of 0
Osorno 0
against 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
the 0
Chilean 0
Bishops. 0

First 0
he 0
insulted 0
the 0
abuse 0
victims. 0

Then, 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
and 0
a 0
revolt 0
by 0
the 0
Chilean 0
victims 0
and 0
faithful, 0
did 0
he 0
recognize 0
his 0
error 0
and 0
apologize, 0
while 0
stating 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
misinformed, 0
causing 0
a 0
disastrous 1
situation 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Chile, 0
but 0
continuing 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
two 0
Chilean 0
Cardinals 0
Errazuriz 0
and 0
Ezzati. 0

Even 0
in 0
the 0
tragic 0
affair 0
of 0
McCarrick, 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
behavior 0
was 0
no 0
different. 0

He 0
knew 0
from 0
at 0
least 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
that 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
a 0
serial 1
predator. 1

Although 0
he 0
knew 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
corrupt 0
man, 0
he 0
covered 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
bitter 0
end; 0
indeed, 0
he 0
made 0
McCarrick’s 0
advice 0
his 0
own, 0
which 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
inspired 0
by 0
sound 0
intentions 0
and 0
for 0
love 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

It 0
was 0
only 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
report 0
of 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
a 0
minor, 0
again 0
on 0
the 0
basis 0
of 0
media 0
attention, 0
that 0
he 0
took 0
action 0
[regarding 0
McCarrick] 0
to 0
save 0
his 0
image 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

Now 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
a 0
chorus 0
of 0
voices 0
is 0
rising 0
especially 0
from 0
the 0
lay 0
faithful, 0
and 0
has 0
recently 0
been 0
joined 0
by 0
several 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests, 0
asking 0
that 0
all 0
those 0
who, 0
by 0
their 0
silence, 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
criminal 0
behavior, 0
or 0
who 0
used 0
him 0
to 0
advance 0
their 0
career 0
or 0
promote 0
their 0
intentions, 0
ambitions 0
and 0
power 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
should 0
resign. 0

But 0
this 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
enough 0
to 0
heal 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
extremely 1
grave 1
immoral 1
behavior 1
by 0
the 0
clergy: 0
bishops 0
and 0
priests. 0

A 0
time 0
of 0
conversion 0
and 0
penance 0
must 0
be 0
proclaimed. 0

The 0
virtue 0
of 0
chastity 0
must 0
be 0
recovered 0
in 0
the 0
clergy 0
and 0
in 0
seminaries. 0

Corruption 0
in 0
the 0
misuse 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
resources 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
offerings 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
must 0
be 0
fought 0
against. 0

The 0
seriousness 0
of 0
homosexual 0
behavior 0
must 0
be 0
denounced. 0

The 0
homosexual 0
networks 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
must 0
be 0
eradicated, 0
as 0
Janet 0
Smith, 0
Professor 0
of 0
Moral 0
Theology 0
at 0
the 0
Sacred 0
Heart 0
Major 0
Seminary 0
in 0
Detroit, 0
recently 0
wrote. 0

“The 0
problem 0
of 0
clergy 0
abuse,” 0
she 0
wrote, 0
“cannot 0
be 0
resolved 0
simply 0
by 0
the 0
resignation 0
of 0
some 0
bishops, 0
and 0
even 0
less 0
so 0
by 0
bureaucratic 0
directives. 0

The 0
deeper 0
problem 0
lies 0
in 0
homosexual 0
networks 0
within 0
the 0
clergy 0
which 0
must 0
be 0
eradicated.” 0
These 0
homosexual 0
networks, 0
which 0
are 0
now 0
widespread 0
in 0
many 0
dioceses, 0
seminaries, 0
religious 0
orders, 0
etc., 0
act 0
under 0
the 0
concealment 0
of 0
secrecy 0
and 0
lies 0
with 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
octopus 0
tentacles, 0
and 0
strangle 0
innocent 0
victims 0
and 0
priestly 0
vocations, 0
and 0
are 0
strangling 0
the 0
entire 0
Church. 0

I 0
implore 0
everyone, 0
especially 0
Bishops, 0
to 0
speak 0
up 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
defeat 0
this 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
widespread, 0
and 0
to 0
report 0
the 0
cases 0
of 0
abuse 0
they 0
know 0
about 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
civil 0
authorities. 0

Let 0
us 0
heed 0
the 0
most 0
powerful 0
message 0
that 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
left 0
us 0
as 0
an 0
inheritance:Do 0
not 1
be 1
afraid! 1

Do 1
not 1
be 1
afraid! 1

In 0
his 0
2008 0
homily 0
on 0
the 0
Feast 0
of 0
the 0
Epiphany, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
reminded 0
us 0
that 0
the 0
Father’s 0
plan 0
of 0
salvation 0
had 0
been 0
fully 0
revealed 0
and 0
realized 0
in 0
the 0
mystery 0
of 0
Christ’s 0
death 0
and 0
resurrection, 0
but 0
it 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
welcomed 0
in 0
human 0
history, 0
which 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
history 0
of 0
fidelity 0
on 0
God’s 0
part 0
and 0
unfortunately 0
also 0
of 0
infidelity 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
us 0
men. 0

The 0
Church, 0
the 0
depositary 0
of 0
the 0
blessing 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Covenant, 0
signed 0
in 0
the 0
blood 0
of 0
the 0
Lamb, 0
is 0
holy 0
but 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
sinners, 0
as 0
Saint 0
Ambrose 0
wrote: 0
the 0
Church 0
is 0
“immaculata 0
ex 0
maculatis,” 0
she 0
is 0
holy 0
and 0
spotless 0
even 0
though, 0
in 0
her 0
earthly 0
journey, 0
she 0
is 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
men 0
stained 1
with 1
sin. 1

I 0
want 0
to 0
recall 0
this 0
indefectible 0
truth 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
holiness 0
to 0
the 0
many 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
so 0
deeply 1
scandalized 1
by 0
the 0
abominable 1
and 0
sacrilegious 0
behavior 0
of 0
the 0
former 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Washington, 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick; 0
by 0
the 0
grave, 0
disconcerting 0
and 0
sinful 1
conduct 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
by 0
the 0
conspiracy 0
of 0
silence 0
of 0
so 0
many 0
pastors, 0
and 0
who 0
are 0
tempted 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Church, 0
disfigured 0
by 0
so 0
many 0
ignominies. 0

At 0
the 0
Angelus 0
on 0
Sunday, 0
August 0
12, 0
2018 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
said 0
these 0
words: 0
“Everyone 0
is 0
guilty 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
he 0
could 0
have 0
done 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
do 0
... 0

If 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
oppose 0
evil, 0
we 0
tacitly 0
feed 0
it. 0

We 0
need 0
to 0
intervene 0
where 0
evil 0
is 0
spreading; 0
for 0
evil 0
spreads 0
where 0
daring 0
Christians 0
who 0
oppose 0
evil 0
with 0
good 0
are 0
lacking.” 0
If 0
this 0
is 0
rightly 0
to 0
be 0
considered 0
a 0
serious 0
moral 0
responsibility 0
for 0
every 0
believer, 0
how 0
much 0
graver 0
is 0
it 0
for 0
the 0
Church’s 0
supreme 0
pastor, 0
who 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
not 0
only 0
did 0
not 0
oppose 0
evil 0
but 0
associated 0
himself 0
in 0
doing 0
evil 0
with 0
someone 0
he 0
knew 0
to 0
be 0
deeply 0
corrupt. 0

He 0
followed 0
the 0
advice 0
of 0
someone 0
he 0
knew 0
well 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
pervert, 1
thus 0
multiplying 0
exponentially 0
with 0
his 0
supreme 0
authority 0
the 0
evil 0
done 0
by 0
McCarrick. 0

And 0
how 0
many 0
other 0
evil 0
pastors 0
is 0

still 0
continuing 0
to 0
prop 0
up 0
in 0
their 0
active 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
Church! 0

Francis 0
is 0
abdicating 0
the 0
mandate 0
which 0
Christ 0
gave 0
to 0
Peter 0
to 0
confirm 0
the 0

Indeed, 0
by 0
his 0
action 0
he 0
has 0
divided 0
them, 0
led 0
them 0
into 0

and 0
encouraged 0
the 0

to 0
continue 0
to 0
tear 0

In 0
this 0
extremely 0
dramatic 0
moment 0
for 0
the 0
universal 0
Church, 0
he 0
must 0
acknowledge 0
his 0

and, 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
the 0
proclaimed 0
principle 0
of 0
zero 0
tolerance, 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
must 0
be 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
set 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
for 0
cardinals 0

who 0
covered 0
up 0
McCarrick’s 0
abuses 0
and 0
resign 0
along 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
them. 0

Even 0
in 0
dismay 0
and 0
sadness 0
over 0
the 0
enormity 0
of 0
what 0
is 0
happening, 0
let 0
us 0
not 0
lose 0
hope! 0

We 0
well 0
know 0
that 0
the 0
great 0
majority 0
of 0
our 0
pastors 0
live 0
their 0
priestly 0
vocation 0
with 0
fidelity 0
and 0
dedication. 0

It 0
is 0
in 0
moments 0
of 0
great 0
trial 0
that 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
grace 0
is 0
revealed 0
in 0
abundance 0
and 0
makes 0
His 0
limitless 0
mercy 0
available 0
to 0
all; 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
granted 0
only 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
truly 0
repentant 0
and 0
sincerely 0
propose 0
to 0
amend 0
their 0
lives. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
favorable 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
confess 0
her 0
sins, 0
to 0
convert, 0
and 0
to 0
do 0
penance. 0

Let 0
us 0
all 0
pray 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
Pope, 0
let 0
us 0
remember 0
how 0
many 0
times 0
he 0
has 0
asked 0
us 0
to 0
pray 0
for 0
him! 0

“I 0

“However, 0
I 0
ask 0
that 0

be 0
civil 0

respectful 0
in 0
your 0

that 0
is 0

Cussing 1

threatening 1
the 0
people 0
involved 0
will 0
not 0
accomplish 0
justice 0
and 0
serves 0
no 0
useful 0
purpose. 0

Remember, 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
all 0
the 0
facts. 0

That 0
will 0
develop 0
as 0
the 0

Yeah, 0
well, 0
that's 1
about 1
as 1
trustworthy 1
as 1
the 1
FBI 1
in 1
this 1
matter. 1

This 0
latest 0
move, 0
while 0
welcome, 0
may 0
only 0
be 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump's 0
vow 0
to 0
"get 0
involved." 0

However, 1
I 1
ask, 1
why 1
were 1
you 1
not 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
place, 1
Mr. 1
President? 1

According 1
to 1
the 1
Constitution, 1
you, 1
and 1
you 1
alone, 1
are 1
the 1
sole 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
executive 1
branch, 1
and 1
as 1
such 1
you 1
are 1
where 1
the 1
buck 1
stop 1
in 1
making 1
sure 1
the 1
laws 1
are 1
faithfully 1
executed. 1

So, 0
if 0
Trump 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
fire 0
Sessions, 0
perhaps 1
he 1
should 1
stop 1
talking 1
about 1
it 1
and 1
get 1
to 1
it 1
and 1
actually 1
put 1
someone 1
in 1
the 1
Justice 1
Department 1
as 1
attorney 1
general 1
who 1
will 1
do 1
the 1
job 1
faithfully, 1
and 1
by 1
that, 1
I 1
don't 1
mean 1
Trey 1
Gowdy. 1

I 1
mean 1
someone 1
who 1
is 1
serious 1
about 1
justice, 1
not 1
political 1
grandstanding 1
or 1
covering 1
up 1
criminal 1
activity. 1

Until 0
then, 0
I'll 0
consider 0
this 0
the 0
means 0
the 0
FBI 0
will 0
use 0
to 0
engage 0
in 0
the 0
further 0
coverup 0
of 0
what 0
really 0
took 0
place 0
at 0
that 0
compound 0
beyond 0
the 0

SPECIAL 0
REPORT: 0
Papal 0
Cover-up 0
Alleged, 0
Pope 0
Accused 0
in 0
International 0
Sex 0
Abuse 0
Case 0

Hey, 0
remember 0
five 0
minutes 0
ago 0
when 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
shouted 0
at 0
a 0
reporter 0
in 0
Chile 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
supporting 0
complaints 0
against 0
his 1
good 1
friend 1
Bishop 1
Juan 1
Barros? 1

And, 0
just 0
for 0
good 0
measure 0
he 0
accused 0
the 0
people 0
accusing 0
him 0
– 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
by 0
Barros’ 0
mentor, 0
the 1
convicted 1
sex-predator 1
Karadima 1
– 0
of 0
committing 0
“calumny”? 1

[1] 0
And 0
remember 0
when 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
told 0
the 0
pope 0
off 0
in 0
public 0
over 0
the 0
“pain” 1
these 0
accusations 0
had 0
caused 0
the 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse? 0

And 0
then 0
remember 0
how 0
the 0
pope 0
had 1
apologised-except-not-really 1
because 0
the 1
accusations 1
are, 1
after 1
all, 1
still 1
lies, 1
and 1
that 1
there’s 1
still 1
“no 1
evidence” 1
against 1
Barros…? 1

The 0
press, 0
secular 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Catholic, 0
is 0
full 0
this 0
week 0
of 0
the 0
story 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
did 0
indeed 0
see 0
evidence 0
of 0
Barros’ 0
complicity 0
in 0
Karadima’s 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
– 0
not 0
only 0
that 0
Barros 0
had 0
helped 0
to 0
cover 0
it 0
up 0
but 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
present 0
and 0
a 0
direct 0
witness 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
therefore 0
a 0
passive 0
participant. 0

Nicole 0
Winfield 0
and 0
the 0
Associated 0
Press 0
dropped 1
the 1
bomb 1
that 0
the 0
information 0
came 0
directly 0
from 0
the 0
victims, 0
whom 0
Francis 0
had 0
dismissed 0
and 0
refused 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
on 0
his 0
trip, 0
and 0
delivered 0
through 0
his 0
own 0
Commission 0
on 0
sexual 0
abuse: 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
received 0
a 0
victim’s 0
letter 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0
graphically 0
detailed 0
how 0
a 0
priest 0
sexually 0
abused 0
him 0
and 0
how 0
other 0
Chilean 0
clergy 0
ignored 0
it, 0
contradicting 0
the 0
pope’s 0
recent 0
insistence 0
that 0
no 0
victims 0
had 0
come 0
forward 0
to 0
denounce 0
the 0
cover-up, 0
the 0
letter’s 0
author 0
and 0
members 0
of 0
Francis’ 0
own 0
sex- 0
abuse 0
commission 0
have 0
told 0
The 0
Associated 0
Press. 0

The 0

fact 0
that 0
Francis 0
received 0
the 0
eight-page 0
letter, 0
obtained 0
by 0
the 0
AP, 0
challenges 0
his 0
insistence 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
“zero 0
tolerance” 0
for 0
sex 0
abuse 0
and 0
cover-ups. 0

It 1
also 1
calls 1
into 1
question 1
his 1
stated 1
empathy 1
with 1
abuse 1
survivors, 1
compounding 0
the 0
most 0
serious 0
crisis 0
of 0
his 0
five-year 0
papacy. 0

Now 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
Francis 0
had 0
also 0
overruled 0
a 0
2015 0
warning 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
the 0
Doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Faith 0
that 0
Barros 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
made 0
a 0
bishop. 0

The 0
Italian 0
Catholic 0
daily 0
La 0
Nuova 0
Bussola 0
Quotidiana 0
reports 0
that 0
not 0
only 0
did 0
the 0
pope 0
see 0
a 0
letter 0
from 0
victims, 0
but 0
that 0
the 0
CDF, 0
under 0
Muller, 0
“had 0
already 0
conducted 0
an 0
preliminary 0
investigation 0
into 0
Barros 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
bishops 0
close 0
to 0
Karadima 0
which 0
had 0
led 0
to 0
the 0
decision 0
to 0
relieve 0
them 0
of 0
their 0
duties.” 0

“But 0
with 0
a 0
letter 0
signed 0
by 0
the 0
Pope 0
in 0
January 0
2015 0
and 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Chilean 0
bishops, 0
the 0
request 0
for 0
exemption 0
is 0
blocked 0
and 0
shortly 0
thereafter 0
Barros 0
is 0
promoted 0
to…Osorno.” 0

The 0
article 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
while 0
Karadima 0
was 0
convicted 0
by 0
a 0
Vatican 0
tribunal 0
on 0
the 0
testimony 0
of 0
the 0
victims, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
same 0
testimony 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
victim-witnesses 0
that 0
Francis 0
now 0
dismisses 0
in 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
Barros. 0

The 0
accusations 0
that 0
stood 0
against 0
Karadima 0
come 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
sources 0
as 0
those 0
against 0
Barros, 0
who 0
the 0
victims 0
said 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
room 0
watching 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

While 0
the 0
specifics 0
are 0
still 0
not 0
known, 0
readers 0
may 0
be 0
reminded 0
by 0
this 0
of 0
a 0
peculiar 0
incident 0
about 0
a 0
year 0
later 0
in 0
which 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
summarily 0
ordered 0
the 0
dismissal 0
of 0
three 0
priests 0
of 0
the 0
CDF, 0
whose 0
remit 0
was 0
investigations 0
of 0
clerics 0
accused 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse. 0

The 0
website 0
One 0
Peter 0
Five 0
reports, 0
via 0
Marco 0
Tosatti, 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
ordered 0
their 0
removal 0
without 0
offering 0
any 0
explanation 0
to 0
then-cardinal 0
prefect 0
Gerhard 0
Muller. 0

When, 0
after 0
several 0
attempts 0
and 0
three 0
months 0
later[2], 0
Muller 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
an 0
audience 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
to 0
ask 0
the 0
reason, 0
he 0
received 0
the 0
response, 0
“I 0
am 1
the 1
pope, 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
need 1
to 1
give 1
reasons 1
for 1
any 1
of 1
my 1
decisions. 1

I 1
have 1
decided 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
leave 1
and 1
they 1
have 1
to 1
leave.” 1

Marco 0
Tosatti 0
reports 0
the 0
CDF 0
incident, 0
but 0
it 0
follows 0
an 0
odd 0
story 0
of 0
a 0
meeting 0
of 0
curial 0
officials 0
to 0
discuss 0
certain 0
bishop 0
appointments. 0

Without 0
naming 0
names, 0
(or, 0
frustratingly, 0
giving 0
dates[3]) 0
Tosatti 0
relates: 0

“It 0
was 0
some 0
time 0
ago 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
bishop, 0
not 0
in 0
Italy. 0

The 0
nuncio 0
has 0
prepared 0
the 0
triad 0
[the 0
“terna” 0
or 0
list 0
of 0
three 0
candidates]. 0

A 0
cardinal, 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
dicastery, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
same 0
holder 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops, 0
during 0
the 0
ordinary 0
assembly 0
took 0
the 0
floor, 0
saying: 0
‘The 0
first 0
candidate 0
indicated 0
is 0
excellent, 0
the 0
second 0
is 0
good. 0

But 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
warn 0
of 0
the 0
third, 0
whom 0
I 0
know 0
well, 0
since 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
seminarian, 0
and 0
who 0
presents 0
problems 0
both 0
on 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
doctrine 0
and 0
morality. 0

He 0
responds 0
little 0
to 0
the 0
necessary 0
criteria. 0

But 0
the 0
third 0
was 0
a 0
friend 0
of 0
someone 0
and 0
another 0
cardinal, 0
of 0
the 0
circle 0
currently 0
in 0
power, 0
has 0
flung 0
himself 0
at 0
his 0
colleague, 0
accusing 0
him 0
of 0
impropriety.’ 0
The 0
meeting 0
ended 0
without 0
further 0
decisions.” 0

Whatever 0
the 0
details 0
of 0
these 0
strange 0
incidents, 0
what 0
is 0
clear 0
in 0
Chile 0
is 0
that 0
no 0
amount 0
of 0
eyewitness 0
testimony 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
slightest 0
difference. 0

Bergoglio 0
wanted 0
Barros 0
as 0
a 0
bishop 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
that. 0

Even 0
while 0
“apologising” 0
the 0
pope 0
had 0
doubled 0
down 0
when 0
questioned 0
about 0
it 0
by 0
journalists, 0
saying, 0
“You, 0
in 0
all 0
good 0
will, 0
tell 0
me 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
victims, 0
but 0
I 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any, 0
because 0
they 0
haven’t 0
come 0
forward.” 0

“In 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Barros 0
it’s 0
been 0
observed, 0
it’s 0
been 0
studied; 0
there’s 0
no 0
evidence. 0

The 0
best 0
thing 0
to 0
do 0
if 0
someone 0
believes 0
it’s 0
the 0
case 0
is 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
quickly 0
with 0
evidence.” 0

The 0
AP 0
report, 0
however, 0
says 0
exactly 0
the 0
opposite; 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
(now 0
defunct[4]) 0
abuse 0
Commission 0
had 0
approached 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley, 0
the 0
pope’s 0
“top 0
abuse 0
advisor,” 0
with 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
deliver 0
to 0
the 0
pope. 0

Marie 0
Collins, 0
the 0
Irish 0
abuse 0
survivor 0
and 0
Commission 0
member 0
who 0
resigned, 0
citing 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
refusal 0
to 0
take 0
meaningful 0
action, 0
told 0
AP, 0
“When 0
we 0
gave 0
him 0
[O’Malley] 0
the 0
letter 0
for 0
the 0
pope, 0
he 0
assured 0
us 0
he 0
would 0
give 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
speak 0
of 0
the 0
concerns. 0

And 0
at 0
a 0
later 0
date, 0
he 0
assured 0
us 0
that 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
done.” 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz, 0
the 0
Karadima 0
victim 0
whose 0
membership 0
on 0
the 0
Commission 0
the 0
Vatican 0
had 0
blocked, 0
told 0
AP, 0
“Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
called 0
me 0
after 0
the 0
pope’s 0
visit 0
here 0
in 0
Philadelphia 0
and 0
he 0
told 0
me, 0
among 0
other 0
things, 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
given 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
– 0
in 1
his 1
hands.” 1

On 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
it, 0
there 0
are 0
only 0
a 0
few 0
logical 0
possibilities 0
here. 0

In 0
fact, 0
unless 0
Cardinal 0
O’Malley 0
– 0
who 0
has, 0
as 0
of 0
this 0
writing, 0
remained 0
silent 0
– 0
comes 0
forward 0
and 0
says 0
that 0
he 0
didn’t 0
hand 0
the 0
letter 0
over 0
pope, 0
there 0
is 0
really 0
only 0
one; 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
lied. 0

And 0
this 0
is 0
what 0
is 0
now 0
being 0
said 0
quite 0
openly 0
by 0
a 0
vast 0
array 0
of 0
voices, 0
secular 0
and 0
Catholic, 0
left 0
and 0
right. 0

As 0
Winfield 0
writes, 0

“The 0
revelation 0
could 0
be 0
costly 0
for 0
Francis, 0
whose 0
track 0
record 0
on 0
the 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
was 0
already 0
shaky 0
after 0
a 0
botched 0
Italian 0
abuse 0
case 0
he 0
intervened 0
in 0
became 0
public[5]. 0

More 0
recently, 0
he 0
let 0
the 0
abuse 0
commission 0
lapse 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
last 0
year. 0

Vatican 0
analysts 0
now 0
openly 0
question 0
whether 0
he 0
‘gets 0
it,’ 0
and 0
some 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
advisers 0
privately 0
acknowledge 0
that 0
maybe 0
he 0
doesn’t.” 0

“No 0
evidence…” 0
Lie 1
big, 1
lie 1
often, 1
and 1
when 1
caught, 1
keep 1
lying. 1

One 0
of 0
the 0
many 0
things 0
these 0
secular 1
reporters 1
seem 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
paying 0
attention 0
to 0
is 0
that 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
is 0
in 0
fact 0
a 0
well-rehearsed, 0
stock 0
response 0
for 0
Bergoglio. 0

He 0
said 0
almost 0
exactly 0
the 0
same 0
in 0
2013 0
when 0
confronted 0
about 0
another 0
predatory 1
homosexual 1
he 0
was 0
sheltering. 0

The 0
hoopla 0
surrounding 0
the 0
“Who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge” 1
comment 0
tends 0
to 0
obscure 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
comment. 0

It 0
was 0
made 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
by 0
a 0
journalist 0
about 0
Monsignore 0
Battista 0
Ricca 0
– 0
a 0
prelate 0
whose 0
promiscuous 0
homosexuality 0
is 0
so 0
well 0
known 0
it 0
was 0
covered 0
by 0
the 0
Telegraph 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
July 0
2013. 0

Ilze 0
Scamparini 0
asked 0
the 0
pope 0
about 0
Ricca, 0
saying, 0
“What 0
you 0
intend 0
to 0
do 0
about 0
this? 0

How 0
are 0
you 0
confronting 0
this 0
issue 0
and 0
how 0
does 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
intend 0
to 0
confront 0
the 0
whole 0
question 0
of 0
the 0
gay 0
lobby?” 0

What 0
reply 0
did 0
Bergoglio 0
give? 0

His 0
standard 0
one: 0
“No 1
evidence.” 1

About 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca: 0
I 0
did 0
what 0
canon 0
law 0
calls 0
for, 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
preliminary 0
investigation. 0

And 0
from 0
this 0
investigation, 0
there 0
was 0
nothing 0
of 0
what 0
had 0
been 0
alleged. 0

We 0
did 0
not 0
find 0
anything 0
of 0
that. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
response.” 0

He 0
added, 0
“In 0
this 0
case, 0
I 0
conducted 0
the 0
preliminary 0
investigation 0
and 0
we 0
didn’t 0
find 0
anything.” 0

But 0
Ricca’s 0
activities, 0
for 0
which 0
the 0
pope 0
claimed 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
evidence, 0
were 0
notorious. 0

They 0
include 0
being 0
caught 0
in 0
flagrante 0
in 0
an 0
elevator 0
with 0
a 0
teenaged 0
male 0
prostitute, 0
and 0
his 0
sexual 0
relationship 0
with 0
a 0
captain 0
in 0
the 0
Swiss 0
army. 0

So 0
flagrant 1
was 0
Ricca’s 0
behaviour 0
that 0
it 0
took 0
intervention 0
by 0
Uruguay’s 0
nuncio 0
to 0
have 0
him 0
removed. 0

It 0
was 0
reported 0
in 0
1999 0
and 0
2000 0
by 0
L’Espresso, 0
who 0
said 0
the 0
information 0
was 0
confirmed 0
by 0
“numerous 0
bishops, 0
priests, 0
religious 0
and 0
laity” 0
in 0
Uruguay[6]. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
evidence 0
shows 0
that 0
Ricca 0
is 0
completely 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
Bergoglio’s 0
normal 0
procedures. 0

As 0
“Marcantonio 0
Colonna” 0
wrote 0
in 0
the 0
Dictator 0
Pope, 0
“In 0
fact 0
his 0
patronage 0
of 0
Monsignor 0
Ricca 0
fits 0
the 0
pattern 0
which 0
was 0
well 0
established 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
whereby 0
he 0
surrounds 0
himself 0
with 0
morally 0
weak 0
people 0
so 0
as 0
to 0
have 0
them 0
under 1
his 1
thumb.” 1

It 0
was 0
at 0
this 0
early 0
“no 0
evidence” 0
comment 0
on 0
the 0
plane 0
home 0
from 0
Rio 0
that 0
some 0
of 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
started 0
to 0
understand 0
that 0
Bergoglio’s 0
policy 0
is 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
that 0
of 0
certain 0
leaders 0
of 0
the 0
past 0
who 0
recommended 0
that 0
if 0
a 0
politician 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
lie, 0
he 0
should 0
lie 1
big 1
and 1
lie 1
brazenly. 1

And 0
in 0
case 0
anyone 0
was 0
wondering 0
what 0
will 0
happen 0
next, 0
the 0
same 0
advice 0
said 0
to 0
keep 0
on 0
lying 0
after 0
you’re 0
caught. 0

The 0
pattern 0
of 0
silence 0
and, 0
when 0
pressed, 0
flat-out 0
denial 0
has 0
been 0
Bergoglio’s 0
policy 0
since 0
long 0
before 0
he 0
came 0
on 0
the 0
international 0
scene. 0

He 0
has 0
a 0
long 0
record 0
in 0
Argentina 0
of 0
shaving 0
close 0
to 0
scandals 0
and 0
vociferously 0
denying 0
involvement, 0
and 0
relying 0
heavily 0
on 0
the 0
broad 0
good 0
will 0
of 0
Catholics 0
towards 0
bishops 0
to 0
pull 0
it 0
off. 0

Perhaps 0
his 0
biggest 0
error 0
with 0
Barros 0
was 0
failing 0
to 0
understand 0
just 0
how 0
little 0
of 0
that 0
capital 0
of 0
trust 0
there 0
is 0
left 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
world 0
as 0
a 0
whole. 0

Indeed, 0
on 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
priests 0
sexually 0
abusing 0
young 0
people, 0
it 0
could 0
only 0
be 0
measured 0
in 0
the 0
negative 0
numbers. 0

“Argentine 0
Victims 0
Who 0
Tried 0
to 0
Meet 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis…” 0

Though 0
the 0
website 0
Bishop 0
Accountability 0
is 0
blatantly 0
anti-clerical, 0
their 0
data 0
is 0
unassailable 0
since 0
most 0
of 0
it 0
comes 0
from 0
information 0
that 0
is 0
already 0
public. 0

On 0
their 0
Argentina 0
page 0
is 0
a 0
long 0
list 0
of 0
accusations 0
that 0
Bergoglio/Francis 0
simply 0
isn’t 0
interested 0
in 0
hearing 0
from 0
victims. 0

“In 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
21 0
years 0
as 0
bishop 0
and 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
the 0
Wall 0
Street 0
Journal 0
reports, 0
including 0
the 0
years 0
when 0
he 0
headed 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops’ 0
conference, 0
he 0
declined 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
abuse.” 0

“All 0

of 0
them 0
tried 0
to 0
contact 0
the 0
cardinal 0
archbishop 0
in 0
2002 0
or 0
later,” 0
the 0
same 0
period 0
when 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
and 0
other 0
bishops 0
were 0
striving 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
victims 0
and 0
demonstrate 0
an 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
problem. 0

The 0
site 0
says 0
that 0
“in 0
addition 0
to 0
Bergoglio’s 0
failure 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
victims, 0
the 0
public 0
record 0
contains 0
no 0
evidence 0
that 0
he 0
released 0
any 0
information 0
about 0
abusers.” 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
went 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
to 0
flatly 0
deny 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
any 0
instances 0
of 0
abuse 0
in 0
his 0
archdiocese. 0

Weeks 0
after 0
his 0
election 0
to 0
the 0
papacy, 0
he 0
was 0
quoted 0
by 0
his 0
close 0
friend, 0
Rabbi 0
Abraham 0
Skorka, 0
“In 0
my 0
diocese 0
it 0
never 0
happened 0
to 0
me, 0
but 0
a 0
bishop 0
called 0
me 0
once 0
by 0
phone 0
to 0
ask 0
me 0
what 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
this.” 0
Francis 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
agreed 0
with 0
the 0
“zero 0
tolerance” 0
attitude 0
of 0
the 0
Irish 0
episcopate 0
and 0
admired 0
Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
reforms 0
– 0
most 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
later 0
to 0
quietly 0
reverse. 0

It 0
was 0
at 0
exactly 0
this 0
time, 0
however, 0
that 0
victims 0
from 0
Argentina 0
were 0
attempting 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
new 0
pope’s 0
attention. 0

One, 0
known 0
to 0
the 0
press 0
only 0
as 0
“Gabriel,” 0
wanted 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
Francis 0
about 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
he 0
suffered 0
at 0
the 0
hands 0
of 0
Julio 0
César 0
Grassi, 0
accused 0
of 0
molesting 0
at 0
least 0
five 0
boys, 0
“who 0
has 0
been 0
avoiding 0
the 0
sentences 0
of 0
the 0
justice 0
of 0
Morón 0
and 0
the 0
Court 0
of 0
Cassation. 0

So 0
far, 0
judges 0
and 0
prosecutors 0
at 0
all 0
instances 0
found 0
him 0
guilty.” 0

In 0
case 0
anyone 0
thinks 0
the 0
Grassi-Gabriel 0
case 0
was 0
not 0
serious 0
enough 0
for 0
the 0
pope’s 0
attention, 0
Bishop 0
Accountability 0
summarises, 0
“A 0
year 0
after 0
Gabriel 0
had 0
filed 0
criminal 0
charges 0
[2003] 0
but 0
before 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
Grassi’s 0
trial, 0
three 0
men 0
ransacked 0
the 0
survivor’s 0
apartment 0
and 0
beat 0
him.” 0
These 0
men 0
threatened 0
to 0
kill 0
him 0
if 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
retract 0
his 0
testimony 0
and 0
quit 0
the 0
case. 0

Ten 0
years 0
[after 0
Gabriel 0
filed 0
criminal 0
charges], 0
in 0
May 0
2013, 0
with 0
Grassi 0
still 0
free 0
despite 0
his 0
conviction 0
in 0
2009, 0
“Gabriel 0
and 0
his 0
attorney, 0
Juan 0
Pablo 0
Gallego, 0
brought 0
a 0
two-page 0
letter 0
addressed 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
the 0
office 0
of 0
the 0
papal 0
nuncio 0
in 0
Buenos 0
Aires. 0

An 0
employee 0
refused 0
to 0
accept 0
the 0
letter 0
after 0
learning 0
of 0
its 0
topic 0
and 0
threatened 0
to 0
call 0
security 0
if 0
Gabriel 0
and 0
Gallego 0
did 0
not 0
leave 0
the 0
premises.” 0

The 0
group 0
surmises 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
Bergoglio’s 0
direct 0
intervention 0
with 0
judges 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
prevented 0
a 0
conviction 0
against 0
Grassi 0
for 0
so 0
long 0
and 0
delayed 0
his 0
sentencing 0
through 0
multiple 0
appeals. 0

In 0
2006, 0
then-Archbishop 0
Bergoglio 0
complained 0
of 0
a 0
“media 0
campaign” 0
and 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Grassi 0
case 0
was 0
“different” 0
from 0
other 0
accusations. 0

During 0
his 0
criminal 0
trial 0
Grassi 0
said 0
Bergoglio 0
“never 0
let 0
go” 0
of 0
his 0
hand. 0

In 0
2009, 0
Grassi 0
was 0
convicted 0
of 0
two 0
counts 0
of 0
aggravated 0
sexual 0
assault 0
and 0
corruption 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
“Gabriel,” 0
who 0
was 0
aged 0
13 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
abuse, 0
but 0
the 0
appeals 0
dragged 0
on 0
until 0
he 0
was 0
finally 0
sent 0
to 0
prison 0
in 0
September 0
2013. 0

Several 0
more 0
similar 0
cases, 0
all 0
of 0
whom 0
were 0
rebuffed 0
in 0
their 0
attempts 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
Bergoglio, 0
are 0
detailed 0
here, 0
for 1
the 1
strong-of-stomach. 1

A 1
virtuoso 1
performance-liar 1

Looking 0
back 0
and 0
carefully 0
examining 0
his 0
record, 0
Jorge 0
Bergoglio’s 0
mastery 1
of 0
using 0
the 0
weaknesses 0
of 0
morally 0
compromised 0
men 0
is 0
becoming 0
evident. 0

It 0
is 0
arguable 0
that 0
even 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
so-called 0
“San 0
Gallen 0
Mafia” 0
who 0
apparently 0
conspired 0
to 0
put 0
him 0
on 0
Peter’s 0
throne 0
were 0
used 0
by 0
him. 0

But 0
he 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
master 0
of 0
judging 0
an 0
audience 0
and 0
telling 0
them 0
what 0
they 0
expect 0
to 0
hear; 0
a 0
key 0
skill 0
for 0
all 0
grifters 0
and 0
confidence 0
tricksters. 0

Looking 0
carefully 0
at 0
the 0
infamous 0
“Who 0
am 0
I 0
to 0
judge” 0
comment, 0
this 0
was 0
clear 0
early 0
on. 0

The 0
first 0
part 0
of 0
that 0
interview 0
is 0
a 0
blatant 1
and 1
enormous 1
lie, 1
and 0
it 0
was 0
from 0
there 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
moved 0
on 0
to 0
his 0
apology 0
for 0
homosexuality 0
in 0
general. 0

Recall 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
airplane 0
interview, 0
on 0
the 0
trip 0
back 0
to 0
Rome 0
from 0
World 0
Youth 0
Day 0
in 0
Rio, 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
weeks 0
after 0
his 0
election. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
the 0
papal 1
apologists 1
sprang 0
instantly 0
into 0
action 0
and 0
we 0
heard 0
all 0
about 0
how 0
the 0
pope 0
was 0
talking 0
strictly 0
within 0
the 0
boundaries 0
of 0
Catholic 0
doctrine. 0

But 0
perhaps 0
in 0
hindsight, 0
we 0
are 0
ready 0
to 0
examine 0
the 0
full 0
implications 0
of 0
his 0
little 0
speech, 0
one 0
that 0
was 0
clearly 0
well-rehearsed. 0

(Don’t 0
forget, 0
no 0
question 0
is 0
asked 0
in 0
a 0
papal 0
interview 0
without 0
being 0
thoroughly 1
vetted 1
ahead 0
of 0
time. 0

Journalists 0
must 0
submit 0
their 0
questions 0
well 0
in 0
advance.) 0

This 0
was 0
the 0
pope 0
laying 0
out 0
his 0
policy 0
regarding 0
homosexuality, 0
a 0
policy 0
for 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
duly 1
rewarded 1
by 0
being 0
lauded 0
on 0
the 0
cover 0
of 0
the 0
homosexualist 0
lobby’s 0
US 0
trade 0
magazine. 0

carefully: 0

I 0
see 0
that 0
many 0
times 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
over 0
and 0
above 0
this 0
case, 0
but 0
including 0
this 0
case, 0
people 0
search 0
for 0
“sins 0
from 0
youth”, 0
for 0
example, 0
and 0
then 0
publish 0
them. 0

They 0
are 0
not 0
crimes, 0
right? 0

Crimes 0
are 0
something 0
different: 0
the 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
is 0
a 0
crime. 0

No, 0
sins. 0

But 0

if 0
a 0
person, 0
whether 0
it 0
be 0
a 0
lay 0
person, 0
a 0
priest 0
or 0
a 0
religious 0
sister, 0
commits 0
a 0
sin 0
and 0
then 0
converts, 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgives, 0
and 0
when 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgives, 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgets 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
very 0
important 0
for 0
our 0
lives. 0

When 0
we 0
confess 0
our 0
sins 0
and 0
we 0
truly 0
say, 0
“I 0
have 0
sinned 0
in 0
this”, 0
the 0
Lord 0
forgets, 0
and 0
so 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
right 0
not 0
to 0
forget, 0
because 0
otherwise 0
we 0
would 0
run 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
the 0
Lord 0
not 0
forgetting 0
our 0
sins. 0

That 1
is 1
a 1
danger. 1

This 0

is 0
important: 0
a 0
theology 0
of 0
sin. 0

Many 0
times 0
I 0
think 0
of 0
Saint 0
Peter. 0

He 0
committed 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
worst 0
sins, 0
that 0
is 0
he 0
denied 0
Christ, 0
and 0
even 0
with 0
this 0
sin 0
they 0
made 0
him 0
Pope. 0

We 0
have 0
to 0
think 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
about 0
that. 0

But, 0

returning 0
to 0
your 0
question 0
more 0
concretely. 0

In 0
this 0
case, 0
I 0
conducted 0
the 0
preliminary 0
investigation 0
and 0
we 0
didn’t 0
find 0
anything. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
question. 0

Then, 0
you 0
spoke 0
about 0
the 0
gay 0
lobby. 0

So 0
much 0
is 0
written 0
about 0
the 0
gay 0
lobby. 0

I 0
still 0
haven’t 0
found 0
anyone 0
with 0
an 0
identity 0
card 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
with 0
“gay” 0
on 0
it. 0

They 0
say 0
there 0
are 0
some 0
there. 0

I 0

believe 0
that 0
when 0
you 0
are 0
dealing 0
with 0
such 0
a 0
person, 0
you 0
must 0
distinguish 0
between 0
the 0
fact 0
of 0
a 0
person 0
being 0
gay 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
of 0
someone 0
forming 0
a 0
lobby, 0
because 0
not 0
all 0
lobbies 0
are 0
good. 0

This 0
one 0
is 0
not 0
good. 0

If 0

someone 0
is 0
gay 0
and 0
is 0
searching 0
for 0
the 0
Lord 0
and 0
has 0
good 0
will, 0
then 0
who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge 1
him? 1

The 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
explains 0
this 0
in 0
a 0
beautiful 0
way, 0
saying 0
... 0
wait 0
a 0
moment, 0
how 0
does 0
it 0
say 0
it 0
... 0
it 0
says: 0
“no 0
one 0
should 0
marginalize 0
these 0
people 0
for 0
this, 0
they 0
must 0
be 0
integrated 0
into 0
society”. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
having 0
this 0
tendency, 0
no, 0
we 0
must 0
be 0
brothers 0
and 0
sisters 0
to 0
one 0
another, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
this 0
one 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
that 0
one. 0

The 0
problem 0
is 0
in 0
making 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
this 0
tendency: 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
misers, 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
politicians, 0
a 0
lobby 0
of 0
masons, 0
so 1
many 1
lobbies. 1

For 0
me, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
greater 0
problem. 0

Thank 0
you 0
so 0
much 0
for 0
asking 0
this 0
question. 0

Many 0
thanks. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
favourite 0
rhetorical 0
techniques 0
is 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
Begging 0
the 0
Question 0
and 0
conspiracy. 0

He 0
starts 0
by 0
assuming, 0
without 0
any 0
effort 0
at 0
defence 0
or 0
explanation, 0
a 0
point 0
that 0
concedes 0
the 0
whole 0
issue. 0

This 0
was 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
pope 0
had 0
ever 0
used 0
the 0
political 0
term 0
“gay”. 0

Not 0
“homosexual,” 0
not 0
“same-sex 0
attracted,” 0
but 0
“gay,” 0
meaning 0
that 0
he 0
started 0
by 0
adopting 0
the 0
entirety 0
of 0
the 0
homosexualist 0
movement’s 0
linguistic 0
manipulations. 0

Language 0
counts 0
in 0
politics, 0
and 0
a 0
pope 0
using 0
that 0
term 0
means 0
he 0
is 0
by 0
implication 0
starting 0
the 0
discussion 0
– 0
and 0
his 0
pontificate 0
– 0
by 0
aligning 0
himself 0
with 0
the 0
basic 0
tenets 0
of 0
a 0
movement 0
that 0
is 0
violently 1
opposed 1
to 0
Catholic 0
moral 0
teaching, 0
and 0
in 0
direct 0
opposition 0
to 0
his 0
immediate, 0
and 0
still 0
living, 0
predecessor. 0

In 0
this 0
case 0
too, 0
he 0
was 0
addressing 0
a 0
plane 0
load 0
of 0
journalists 0
who 0
were 0
either 0
secular 0
themselves, 0
or 0
for 0
the 0
most 0
part 0
are 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
Catholic 0
who 0
believes 0
it 0
is 0
fine 0
to 0
“disagree” 0
with 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
on 0
sexuality. 0

There 0
are 0
very 0
few 0
“conservative” 0
Catholics 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
journalist 0
pool. 0

This 0
means 0
that 0
his 0
use 0
of 0
this 0
language 0
was 0
a 0
conspiratorial 0
wink 0
and 0
nod 0
to 0
his 0
immediate 0
audience, 0
a 0
sly 0
message 0
to 0
say, 0
“People 0
talk 0
all 0
the 0
time 0
about 0
a 0
gay 0
lobby, 0
but 0
you 0
and 0
I 0
both 0
know 0
this 0
is 0
mostly 0
nonsense, 1
propaganda 1
from 0
those 0
people… 0
those 0
conservatives…We 0
cool 1
and 1
hip 1
people 1
don’t 1
hate 1
gays, 1
do 1
we?” 1

This 0
astonishing 0
departure 0
follows 0
an 0
implied 0
but 0
very 0
clear 0
assertion 0
that 0
Ricca 0
has 0
repented 0
and 0
given 0
up 0
his 0
activity, 0
an 0
assertion 0
that 0
has 0
absolutely 0
no 0
evidence 0
to 0
back 0
it 0
up. 0

We 1
are 1
simply 1
asked 1
to 1
take 1
the 1
pope’s 1
word 1
for 1
it, 1
but 0
given 0
that 0
it 0
follows 0
his 0
astoundingly 1
brazen 1
lie 1
that 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
evidence 0
for 0
Ricca’s 0
homosexual 0
activity 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place, 0
we 0
can 0
take 0
the 0
assurance 0
for 0
what 0
it 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
worth. 0

Next, 0
after 0
another 0
little 0
inside 0
nudge-nudge-wink-wink 1
joke 1
about 0
the 0
“gay 0
lobby” 0
– 0
implying 0
(but 0
of 0
course 0
never 0
outright 0
saying) 0
that 0
the 0
whole 0
thing 0
is 0
hysterical 1
nonsense 1
– 0
we 0
hear 0
a 0
direct 0
contradiction 0
to 0
Catholic 0
teaching 0
from 0
no 0
less 0
a 0
source 0
than 0
his 0
predecessor, 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
Ratzinger. 0

“The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
having 0
this 0
tendency.” 0
Well, 0
actually, 0
your 0
holiness, 0
yes 0
it 0
is, 0
particularly 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
priests. 0

The 0
“tendency” 0
is 0
called 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
catechism 0
you 0
quote 0
“intrinsically 1
disordered” 1
and 0
Ratzinger 0
was 0
very 0
clear 0
that 0
this 0
“tendency” 0
is 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
a 1
serious 1
emotional 1
dysfunction 1
that 1
“must” 1
preclude 1
a 1
man 1
from 1
being 1
ordained. 1

Squandering 1
the 1
capital 1
of 1
trust 1

A 0
few 0
months 0
ago 0
in 0
a 0
piece 0
for 0
the 0
Remnant, 0
I 0
talked 0
about 0
why 0
the 0
Church 0
(and 0
nearly 0
all 0
human 0
societies) 0
regard 0
lying 0
as 0
a 0
sin: 0

A 0
mistake 0
many 0
make 0
about 0
lying 0
is 0
to 0
understand 0
it 0
only 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
morality. 0

But 0
Thomas 0
makes 0
the 0
point 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
first 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
metaphysics. 0

Lying 0
is 0
an 0
act 0
at 0
variance 0
in 0
its 0
essence 0
with 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
reality. 0

Thomistic 0
theology 0
teaches 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
by 0
lying 0
that 0
we 0
become 0
most 0
like 0
the 0
devil, 0
and 0
most 0
unlike 0
God, 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
reality 0
to 0
suit 0
our 0
own 0
purposes. 0

Habitual 0
lying 0
in 0
effect 0
changes 0
you 0
into 0
a 0
different 0
kind 0
of 0
being, 0
one 0
that 0
is 0
by 0
nature 0
an 0
opponent 0
of 0
Truth, 0
ordered 0
against 0
Truth. 0

This 0
of 0
course 0
means 0
that 0
a 0
person 0
whose 0
“orientation,” 0
as 0
we 0
might 0
say, 0
is 0
towards 0
falsehood, 0
even 0
when 0
he 0
is 0
at 0
any 0
given 0
moment 0
saying 0
something 0
true, 0
is 0
still 0
servicing 0
his 0
lies. 0

He 0
tells 0
the 0
truth 0
only 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
control 0
and 0
manipulate 0
reality. 0

It 0
was 0
not 0
by 0
violence, 0
but 0
by 0
lying 0
and 0
manipulation, 0
by 0
issuing 0
half-truths 0
and 0
pretending 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
man 0
he 0
was 0
not, 0
that 0
Shakespeare’s 0
character 0
Iago 0
earned 0
the 0
title 0
of 0
most 0
evil 0
character 0
in 0
English 0
literature. 0

Human 0
beings 0
are 0
naturally 0
ordered 0
towards 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
to 0
work 0
at 0
assuming 0
a 0
lie. 0

This 0
is 0
why 0
confidence 0
tricksters 0
can 0
be 0
successful, 0
why 0
lying 0
works 0
for 0
getting 0
what 0
you 0
want; 0
people 0
don’t 0
see 0
it 0
coming. 0

The 0
first 0
natural 0
assumption 0
is 0
trust, 0
at 0
least 0
at 0
the 0
basic 0
level 0
of 0
expecting 0
truth 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
time. 0

We 0
therefore 0
instinctively 0
see 0
lying 0
as 0
a 0
betrayal 0
of 0
trust. 0

Considering 0
how 0
much 0
trust 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
had 0
in 0
the 0
papacy 0
until 0
about 0
1965, 0
how 0
much 0
un-earned 0
trust 0
Francis 0
started 0
with 0
just 0
by 0
being 0
elected, 0
this 0
pontificate 0
should 0
be 0
remembered 0
as 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
confidence 1
scams 1
in 0
history. 0

Believing 0
Catholics 0
have 0
watched 1
aghast 1
as 0
this 0
pope 0
has 0
habitually 0
trampled 0
on 0
every 0
aspect 0
of 0
Catholic 0
teaching. 0

Sandro 0
Magister 0
recently 0
published 0
a 0
piece 0
on 0
his 0
website 0
that 0
listed 0
in 0
dizzying 1
detail 1
the 0
many 0
times, 0
in 0
only 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
months, 0
that 0
pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
falsified 0
with 0
obvious 0
intention, 0
the 0
words 0
of 0
Christ 0
in 0
Scripture 0
and 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

Of 0
course 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
of 0
little 0
interest 0
to 0
secular 1
journalists, 1
who 0
have 0
paid 0
no 0
mind 0
to 0
his 0
habit 0
of 0
rewriting 0
Catholicism, 0
but 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
is 0
something 0
secular 1
journalists 1
are 0
very 0
interested 0
in, 0
a 0
fact 0
Bergoglio 0
seems 0
not 0
to 0
have 0
understood. 0

It 0
is 0
now 0
irrefutable 0
that 0
Pope 0
Bergoglio 0
is 0
a 0
habitual 1
liar 1
– 0
that 0
in 0
fact 0
truth, 0
like 0
reality, 0
seems 0
to 0
mean 0
nothing 0
to 0
him 0
except 0
as 0
a 0
tool. 0

Sociologists 0
talk 0
about 0
the 0
concept 0
of 0
the 0
“high 0
trust 0
society,” 0
one 0
in 0
which 0
citizens 0
believe 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
told 0
by 0
the 0
elites 0
and 0
trust 0
them 0
to 0
govern 0
and 0
protect 0
them 0
adequately. 0

They 1
warn 1
that 1
the 1
general 1
loss 1
of 1
trust 1
in 1
institutions 1
leads 1
to 1
a 1
general 1
state 1
of 1
chaos, 1
in 1
which 1
laws 1
on 1
the 1
books 1
matter 1
little 1
as 1
citizens 1
turn 1
to 1
their 1
last 1
resort 1
of 1
protecting 1
themselves 1
and 1
their 1
own 1
families. 1

This 0
is 0
the 0
way 0
societies 0
disintegrate. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
said 0
many 0
times 0
that 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
massive 0
loss 0
of 0
trust 0
in 0
prelates 0
among 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful, 0
and 0
this 0
is 0
true. 0

With 0
a 0
professional 1
confidence 1
trickster 1
on 0
the 0
papal 0
throne, 0
blatantly 1
using 1
lies 1
and 1
manipulation 1
to 0
maintain 0
power 0
and 0
ram 0
through 0
an 0
agenda 0
at 0
radical 0
variance 0
with 0
Catholic 0
doctrine, 0
how 0
long 0
before 0
that 0
predictable 0
disintegration 0
occurs? 0

Are 0
we 0
seeing 0
it 0
already? 0

Are 0
we 0
seeing 0
it 0
in 0
the 0
declarations 0
of 0
this 0
or 0
that 0
episcopate 0
on 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
and 0
Communion 0
for 0
divorced 0
and 0
civilly 0
remarried 0
Catholics? 0

With 0
Cardinal 0
Marx 0
and 0
others 0
promoting 0
“blessings” 0
for 0
“same-sex 0
unions” 0
are 0
we 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
seeing 0
an 0
escalation 0
of 0
it? 0

I 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
veritable 0
chorus 0
of 0
Catholics 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
declaring 0
that 0
if 1
Paul 1
VI 1
is 1
canonised, 1
their 1
loss 1
of 1
faith 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
as 1
an 1
institution 1
will 1
be 1
complete. 1

I 0
am 0
told 0
from 0
contacts 0
inside 0
the 0
Vatican 0
that 0
after 0
the 0
trip 0
to 0
Chile 0
Bergoglio’s 0
support 0
has 0
completely 0
dried 0
up. 0

He 0
has 0
no 0
more 0
resources 0
of 0
trust 0
even 0
among 0
the 0
people 0
he 0
has 0
chosen 0
to 0
surround 0
himself 0
with 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
reports 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Sandri 0
going 0
toe-to-toe 0
with 0
him 0
in 0
a 0
shouting 1
match, 1
it 0
seems 0
that 0
perhaps 0
even 0
his 0
legendary 0
vicious 1
temper 1
tantrums 1
are 0
failing 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
desired 0
effect 0
of 0
terrorising 1
his 1
subordinates 1
into 1
submission. 1

Marie 0
Collins, 0
by 0
no 0
stretch 0
even 0
a 0
“conservative” 0
Catholic, 0
echoed 0
this 0
concern, 0

the 0
Barros 0
affair 0
has 0
“definitely 0
undermined 0
credibility, 0
trust, 0
and 0
hope” 0
in 0
Francis. 0

“All 0
I 0
can 0
say 0
is 0
that 0
people 0
who 0
had 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
hope 0
in 0
this 0
particular 0
pope, 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
talking 0
about 0
just 0
ordinary 0
Catholics 0
that 0
I 0
know 0
in 0
my 0
own 0

would 0
find 0
it 0
very 0
difficult 0
now…and 0
cannot 0
understand 0
and 0
cannot 0
believe 0
that 0
this 0

the 0
things 0
he 0
has 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
weeks,” 0
she 0
told 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Reporter. 0

It 0
may 0
seem 0
like 0
a 0
moment 0
to 0
enjoy, 0
seeing 0
the 0
apparently 1
unbreachable 1
shell 1
of 1
papal 1
teflon 1
finally 0
cracking, 0
but 0
in 0
reality 0
this 0
situation 0
is 0
potentially 0
very 0
harmful 0
for 0
souls 0
in 0
the 0
long 0
run. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
multitude 0
of 0
problems 0
this 0
pontificate 0
has 0
created 0
or 0
made 0
worse 0
that 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
dealing 0
with 0
for 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
after 0
Bergoglio 0
is 0
gone, 0
but 0
perhaps 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
bigger 0
ones 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
trust. 0

Already 0
fractured 0
since 0
the 0
collapse 0
of 0
all 0
Catholic 0
institutions 0
after 0
Vatican 0
II 0
and 0
the 0
horrors 1
of 0
the 0
sex 0
abuse 0
crisis, 0
how 0
much 0
will 0
there 0
be 0
to 0
repair 0
of 0
the 0
once-steadfast 0
trust 0
Catholics 0
instinctively 0
had 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
after 0
this? 0

This 0

Is 0
that 0
clear?” 0

[2] 0
The 0
book 0
“The 0
Dictator 0
Pope” 0
relates 0
that 0
regular 0
meetings 0
between 0
the 0
pope 0
and 0
dicastery 0
heads 0
have 0
been 0
abolished 0
and 0
even 0
high-ranking 0
curia 0
prefects 0
are 0
often 0
unable 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
pope, 0
whose 0
appointments 0
are 0
now 0
completely 0
controlled 0
by 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State. 0

It 0
is 0
certainly 0
clear 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
sees 0
the 0
pope 0
unless 0
Cardinal 0
Parolin 0
approves, 0
which 0
may 0
be 0
the 0
reason 0
Cardinal 0
Zen, 0
in 0
his 0
efforts 0
to 0
warn 0
Francis 0
of 0
the 0
dangers 0
of 0
a 0
Vatican 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
communist 0
Chinese 0
government 0
had 0
to 0
wait 0
in 0
the 0
rain 0
at 0
a 0
Wednesday 0
general 0
audience. 0

[3] 0
This 0
is 0
common 0
in 0
Italian 0
journalism 0
that 0
has 0
somewhat 0
different 0
standards 0
from 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Anglo 0
world… 0
and 0
drives 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0

Italians 0
care 0
about 0
getting 0
a 0
general 0
picture 0
of 0
what’s 0
going 0
on, 0
where 0
Anglo-Saxons 0
are 0
considered 0
weirdly 0
obsessed 0
with 0
trivial 0
details. 0

[4] 0
Though 0
she 0
never 0
blamed 0
the 0
pope, 0
Marie 0
Collins 0
complained 0
that 0
Vatican 0
officialdom 0
had 0
simply 0
not 0
implemented 0
the 0
Commission’s 0
recommendations. 0

The 0
time 0
limit 0
of 0
the 0
Commission’s 0
members 0
was 0
allowed 0
to 0
lapse 0
without 0
renewal 0
and 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
not 0
dissolved 0
formally 0
the 0
Commission 0
has 0
ceased 0
to 0
function 0
with 0
no 0
word 0
of 0
any 0
plan 0
to 0
revive 0
it. 0

[5] 0
Probably 0
a 0
reference 0
to 0
the 0
Inzoli 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
Francis 0
overturned 0
a 0
previous 0
sentence 0
of 0
a 0

tribunal 0
after 0
the 0

approached 0

A 0
caller 0
to 0
the 0
Michael 0
Savage 0
radio 0
show 0
who 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
neighbors 0
with 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
gunman 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
asserts 0
that 0
Paddock 1
could 1
not 1
have 1
carried 1
out 1
the 1
massacre 1
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
actually 0
a 0
“set-up”. 0

The 0
man, 0
a 0
former 0
Marine 0
who 0
called 0
himself 0
Rick, 0
says 0
he 0
was 0
Paddock’s 0
neighbor 0
between 0
December 0
2015 0
and 0
June 0
2016 0
in 0
Mesquite, 0
Nevada. 0

“I 0
can 1
tell 1
you 1
100% 1
this 1
is 1
not 1
that 1
kind 1
of 1
guy,” 1
said 0
Rick, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
see 0
Paddock 0
every 0
other 0
day 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
two 0
would 0
go 0
to 0
a 0
local 0
bar 0
and 0
play 0
slot 0
machines. 0

“He 0
never 0
even 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
he 0
owned 0
a 0
gun,” 0
continued 0
the 0
shooter’s 0
neighbor, 0
adding 0
that 0
Paddock 0
did 0
not 0
express 0
any 0
religious 0
or 0
political 0
opinions 0
during 0
their 0
conversations. 0

“I’m 1
not 1
a 1
big 1
conspiracy 1
theory 1
guy, 1
but 1
it 1
don’t 1
sit 1
right,” 1
said 0
Rick, 0
before 0
making 0
the 0
extraordinary 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
whole 0
shooting 0
was 0
a 0
“set 0
up” 0
and 0
that 0
Paddock’s 1
body 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
left 1
in 1
the 1
hotel 1
room 1
while 1
other 1
assailants 1
carried 1
out 1
the 1
shooting. 1

The 0
caller 0
mentioned 0
how 0
some 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
crowd 0
were 0
warned 0
45 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
shooting 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
going 0
to 0
die, 0
suggesting 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
wider 0
plot 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
“lone 0
wolf” 0
attack. 0

As 0
a 0
firearms 0
expert, 0
he 0
also 0
questioned 0
the 0
lack 0
of 0
flashes 0
coming 0
from 0
the 0
hotel 0
windows 0
where 0
the 0
shooter 0
was 0
supposedly 0
firing 0
from. 0

Rick 0
said 0
he 0
had 0
already 0
contacted 0
the 0
Clark 0
County 0
Sheriff’s 0
Office 0
to 0
relay 0
all 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
knew. 0

Although 0
the 0
claims 0
are 0
intriguing, 0
it 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
remember 0
that 0
after 1
virtually 1
every 1
terror 1
attack 1
and 1
mass 1
shooting, 1
friends 1
and 1
neighbors 1
express 1
shock 1
that 0
the 0
culprit 0
would 0
be 0
capable 0
of 0
carrying 0
out 0
such 0
horrors, 0
with 0
some 0
outright 0
denying 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
possible. 0

If 0
Paddock 0
was 0
planning 0
such 0
a 0
sophisticated 0
operation 0
and 0
hoping 0
to 0
evade 0
detection, 0
he 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
blabbing 0
details 0
about 0
it 0
to 0
his 0
neighbors. 0

However, 0
the 0
neighbor’s 0
claims 0
are 0
certain 0
to 0
attract 0
more 0
attention 0
given 0
that 0
no 0
specific 0
motive 0
has 0
yet 0
to 0
be 0
uncovered 0
for 0
the 0
shooting. 0

What's 0
amazing 0
is 0
that 0
Democrats 0
cover 0
for 0
their 0
own, 0
ignoring 0
the 0
obvious 1
hypocrisy 1
they 0
demonstrate 0
when 0
they 0
opponents 0
are 0
accused 0
of 0
such 0
things. 0

Even 0
one 0

in 0

says, 0
why 0
are 0
they 0
waiting 0
till 0
now 0
to 0
bring 0
this 0
forward? 0

Well, 0
for 0
Ms. 0
Monahan, 0
perhaps 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
asked, 0
but 0
not 0
for 0
Amy 0
Alexander. 0

That 0
report 0
was 0
filed 0
more 0
than 0
a 0

It 0
appears 0
that 0
with 0

Ellison's 0
unwillingness 0
to 0
address 0

the 0
story 0
that 0
perhaps, 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
changed 0
his 0
ways 0
at 0
all. 0

In 0
fact, 0
he 0
can 0
more 0
than 0

justify 0
his 0
actions 0
based 0

The 0
Dallas 0
Police 0
on 0
Thursday 0
announced 0
the 0
findings 0
of 0
a 0
search 0
warrant 0
they 0
executed 0
on 0
the 0
home 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
after 0
he 0
was 0
gunned 0
down 0
in 0
his 0
apartment 0
by 0
one 0
of 0
their 0
own. 0

The 0
department 0
is 0
now 0
accused 0
of 0
trying 0
to 0
“smear” 1
Jean 0
by 0
claiming 0
they 0
found 0
a 0
tiny 1
bit 1
of 0
marijuana 0
in 0
his 0
house—as 0
if 0
this 0
justifies 0
going 0
into 0
someone’s 0
home 0
and 0
murdering 0
them. 0

The 0
timing 0
couldn’t 0
have 0
been 0
more 0
insidiously 0
planned 0
as 0
police 0
released 0
the 0
affidavit 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
funeral—despite 0
having 0
allegedly 0
found 0
the 0
marijuana 0
last 0
week. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
affidavit, 0
when 0
they 0
searched 0
his 0
home, 0
police 0
claimed 0
to 0
have 0
found 0
10.4 0
grams 0
of 0
pot—less 0
than 0
half 0
an 0
ounce. 0

Police 0
also 0
said 0
they 0
found 0
two 0
fired 0
cartridge 0
casings, 0
a 0
police 0
backpack 0
and 0
vest, 0
and 0
a 0
metal 0
marijuana 0
grinder—the 0
horror. 1

Even 1
if 1

did 1
find 1
marijuana, 1
why 1
on 1
earth 1
would 1
they 1
execute 1
a 1
search 1
warrant 1
on 1
an 1
innocent 1

“They 0
[police] 0
immediately 0
began 0
looking 0
to 0
smear 1
him,” 0
attorney 0
Lee 0
Merritt 0
said. 0

“I 0
think 0
it’s 0
unfortunate 1
that 0
law 0
enforcement 0
begin 0
to 0
immediately 0
criminalize 0
the 0
victim—in 0
this 0
case, 0
someone 0
who 0
was 0
clearly 0
was 0
the 0
victim 0
that 0
has 0
absolutely 0
no 0
bearing 0
on 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
his 0
home,” 0
Merritt 0
added 0
to 0
Fox 0
4. 0

Pointing 0
out 0
the 0
glaring 1
nature 0
of 0
the 0
smear 1
campaign 0
was 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
absolutely 0
zero 0
information 0
released 0
about 0
the 0
warrants 0
conducted 0
on 0
officer 0
Amber 0
Guyger, 0
the 0
killer 1
cop 1
who 0
lived 0
just 0
below 0
Jean. 0

“I 0
would 0
love 0
to 0
see 0
more 0
information 0
coming 0
out 0
about 0
the 0
warrants 0
executed 0
on 0
the 0
home 0
of 0
the 0
shooter 0
who 0
lived 0
just 0
below 0
him. 0

I 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any 0
of 0
those,” 0
said 0
Merritt. 0

Merritt 0
accused 0
the 0
department 0
of 0
conducting 0
a 0
“common 0
assassination 0
attempt 0
on 0
the 0
victim 0
that 0
we 0
often 0
see 0
in 0
law 0
enforcement 0
involved 0
shootings.” 0
Sadly, 0
he 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
correct 0
in 0
his 0
accusations. 0

It 0
is 0
standard 0
procedure 0
for 0
police 0
to 0
dig 1
up 1
dirt 1
on 1
their 0
victims 0
in 0
attempts 0
to 0
smear 1
and 0
assassinate 0
their 0
character 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
killer 1
cops 1
look 0
good 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
eye. 0

Even 0
sadder, 0
however, 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
these 0
smear 1
campaigns 0
work 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
time. 0

As 0
the 0
Free 0
Thought 0
Project 0
reported 0
on 0
Wednesday, 0
according 0
to 0
police 0
— 0
who 0
continue 0
to 0
attempt 0
to 0
spin 0
this 0
story 0
into 0
some 0
tragic 0
mistake 0
— 0
Guyger 0
accidentally 0
went 0
into 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment, 0
mistook 0
Jean 0
for 0
an 0
intruder 0
and 0
killed 0
him. 0

“Guyger 0
entered 0
the 0
building 0
and 0
walked 0
down 0
the 0
fourth-floor 0
hallway 0
to 0
what 0
she 0
thought 0
was 0
her 0
apartment,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
arrest 0
warrant 0
made 0
public 0
Monday 0
afternoon. 0

“She 0
inserted 0
a 0
unique 0
door 0
key, 0
with 0
an 0
electronic 0
chip, 0
into 0
the 0
door 0
keyhole. 0

The 0
door, 0
which 0
was 0
slightly 0
ajar 0
prior 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
arrival, 0
fully 0
opened 0
under 0
the 0
force 0
of 0
the 0
key 0
insertion.” 0

“Guyger 0
drew 0
her 0
firearm, 0
gave 0
verbal 0
commands 0
that 0
were 0
ignored 0
by 0
… 0
Jean,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
warrant. 0

“Guyger 0
fired 0
her 0
handgun 0
two 0
times 0
striking 0
[Jean] 0
in 0
the 0
torso. 0

Guyger 0
entered 0
the 0
apartment, 0
immediately 0
called 0
911, 0
requesting 0
police 0
and 0
EMS, 0
and 0
provided 0
first 0
aid 0
to 0
… 0
Jean. 0

“Due 0
to 0
the 0
interior 0
darkness 0
of 0
the 0
apartment, 0
Guyger 0
turned 0
on 0
the 0
interior 0
lights 0
while 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
with 0
911. 0

Upon 0
being 0
asked 0
where 0
she 0
was 0
located 0
by 0
emergency 0
dispatchers, 0
Guyger 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
front 0
door 0
to 0
observe 0
the 0
address 0
and 0
discovered 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
arrest 0
warrant. 0

At 0
no 0
time, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
warrant, 0
does 0
Guyger 0
say 0
what 0
“verbal 0
commands” 0
she 0
gave. 0

What’s 0
more, 0
any 0
verbal 0
commands 0
she 0
did 0
give 0
were 0
entirely 0
irrelevant 0
as 0
she 0
was 0
the 0
intruder—not 0
Jean. 0

Attempting 0
to 0
imply 0
that 0
Jean 0
was 0
somehow 0
at 0
fault 0
for 0
his 0
own 0
death 0
for 0
disobeying 0
the 0
commands 0
of 0
a 0
homicidal 1
cop 1
who’d 0
just 0
illegally 0
broken 0
into 0
his 0
home 0
is 0
as 0
irresponsible 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
reprehensible. 0

What’s 0
more, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
attorneys 0
for 0
Jean, 0
when 0
Guyger 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
phone 0
with 0
police, 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address 0
of 0
the 0
apartment—implying 0
that 0
she 0
knew 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
wrong 0
apartment 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

“From 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
when 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
an 0
affidavit 0
and 0
I’m 0
thinking 0
that 0
I’m 0
at 0
my 0
house 0
and 0
I 0
call 0
911 0
because 0
someone 0
was 0
just 0
shot,” 0
Attorney 0
Daryl 0
Washington 0
said. 0

“Well, 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
thing 0
that 0
I’m 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
is 0
I’m 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
and 0
look 0
at 0
my 0

I’m 0
going 0

this. 0

Why 0
did 0
she 0
have 0
to 0
go 0
outside 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address? 0

It 0
makes 0
no 0
sense 0
whatsoever.” 0

Even 0
more 0
ominous 1
than 0
having 0
to 0
verify 0
the 0
address 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
according 0
to 0
witnesses, 0
Guyger’s 0
story 0
of 0
inserting 0
the 0
key 0
into 0
Jean’s 0
door 0
and 0
it 0
opening 0
up 0
was 0
simply 0
not 0
true. 0

According 0
to 0
witnesses, 0
Guyger 0
was 0
banging 0
on 0
Jean’s 0
door, 0
demanding 0
he 0
let 0
her 0
in. 0

“Independent 0
witnesses 0
have 0
already 0
come 0
forward 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
they 0
heard 0
this 0
officer 0
pounding 0
on 0
the 0
door 0
and 0
demanding 0
to 0
be 0
let 0
in,” 0
Lee 0
Merritt, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
attorneys 0
representing 0
the 0
Jean 0
family, 0
told 0
ABC 0
News. 0

“The 0
contradictions 0
begin 0
to 0
build 0
from 0
there.” 0

The 0
doors 0
in 0
the 0
complex 0
are 0
also 0
equipped 0
with 0
an 0
automatic 0
closing 0
mechanism. 0

This 0
was 0
demonstrated 0
by 0
the 0
attorneys 0
who 0
opened 0
the 0
door 0
and 0
released 0
it 0
several 0
times—showing 0
that 0
it 0
closed 0
every 0
single 0
time—blowing 0
the 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
door 0
was 0
somehow 0
ajar 0
completely 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
water. 0

Jean’s 0
family 0
also 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
incredibly 0
unlikely 0
for 0
Guyger 0
to 0
mistake 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
for 0
her 0
own 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
a 0
distinct 0
red 0
door 0
mat 0
which 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
enough 0
for 0
the 0
cop 0
to 0
know 0
she 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
wrong 0
place. 0

Even 0
as 0
cops 0
come 0
to 0
Guyger’s 0
defense 0
and 0
attempt 0
to 0
shame, 0
smear, 1
and 0
discredit 0
her 0
victim—who 0
was 0
an 0
upstanding 1
member 1
of 1
society 1
regardless 0
of 0
the 0
plant 0
they 0
claim 0
to 0
have 0
found—they 0
are 0
failing 0
miserably. 1

Despite 0
cops 0
rallying 0
behind 0
the 0

to 0
defend 0
this 0
killer 1
cop, 1
the 0

not 0
buying 0
it. 0

In 0

Kashana 0

summed 0
up 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0

campaign 0
quite 0
succinctly. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
cops 0
claiming 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
tiny 0
bit 0
of 0
weed, 0
she 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
also 0
a 0
homicidal 1
cop 1
inside 0
too. 0

also 0
contained 0
an 0
off 0

Being 0
the 0
paragon 0
of 0
political-correctness 0
and 0
queen 0
of 0
virtue-signaling 0
opportunism, 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
Recode’s 0
Kara 0
Swisher 0
this 0
weekend 0
to 0
answer 0
questions 0
about 0
just 1
how 1
evil 1
and 1
awful 1
conservative 0
opponents 0
have 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
months. 0

The 0
conversation 0
began 0
normally, 0
with 0
Clinton 0
hypocritically 1
toeing 1
the 0
progressive 0
line 0
of 0
identity 0
politics 0
by 0
explaining 0
how 0
each 0
of 0
the 0
groups 0
are 0
different 0
but 0
can 0
be 0
managed 0
by 0
the 0
same 0
liberal 0
movement: 0

“What’s 0
often 0
called 0
political 0
correctness 0
is 0
politeness,” 0
Clinton 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
being 0
rude 0
and 0
insulting 0
to 0
people. 0

It’s 0
respecting 0
the 0
diversity 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
in 0
our 0
society,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“The 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
is 0
a 0
much 0
more 0
diverse 0
political 0
party, 0
attracting 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
African-American, 0
Latino, 0
LGBT, 0
whatever 0
the 0
reason 0
why 0
people 0
feel 0
more 0
comfortable 0
where 0
they 0
are 0
taken 0
in, 0
where 0
they 0
are 0
included 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
political 0
movement 0
or 0
party.” 0
“And 0
I 0
don’t 0
think 0
it’s 0
politically 0
correct 0
to 0
say 0
we 0
value 0
that. 0

And 0
I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
go 0
around 0
insulting 0
people. 0

I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
paint 0
with 0
a 0
broad 0
brush 0
every 0
immigrant 0
is 0
this, 0
every 0
African-American 0
is 0
that, 0
every, 0
you 0
know, 0
other 0
person 0
with 0
different 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
or 0
whatever 0
– 0
that’s 1
childish.” 1

Childish, 1
indeed. 1

Insulting, 1
indeed. 1

Just 0
30 0
seconds 0
later, 0
as 0
Swisher 0
asked: 0

“what 0
do 0
you 0
think 0
of 0
Cory 0
Booker… 0
saying 0
‘kick 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
shins,’ 1
essentially…” 0
incorrectly 0
recalling 0
Eric 0
Holder’s 0
recent 0
comments. 0

Which 0
Clinton 0
quickly 0
corrected: 0

“Well 0
that 0
was 0
Eric 0
Holder…” 0

Adding, 0
rather 1
extraordinarily, 1

“Yeah, 0
I 0
know 0
they 0
all 0
look 0
alike,” 0
Clinton 0
joked, 0
triggering 0
howls 0
of 0
laughter 0
from 0
the 0
apparently 0
mind-numbed 0
audience. 0

Sorry 1
Hillary, 1
we 1
don’t 1
think 1
they 1
look 1
anything 1
alike. 1

Or 1
did 1
you 1
mean 1
all 1
black 1
people? 1

Finally, 0
we 0
have 0
one 0
question 0
– 0
what 0
would 0
have 0
happened 0
if 0
Trump 0
said 0
it? 0

As 1
The 1
American 1
Mirror’s 1
Kyle 1
Olsen 1
concludes 1
so 1
eloquently, 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
appears 1
to 1
benefit 1
from 1
her 1
progressive 1
privilege 1
– 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
protects 1
her 1
from 1
getting 1
the 1
‘Roseanne 1
treatment’, 1
and 1
not 1
being 1
dismissed 1
in 1
disgrace. 1

The 0
statement 0
came 0
just 0
a 0
day 0
after 0
Senate 0
Democrats 0
continued 0
their 0
smear 1
of 0
Kavanaugh 0
by 0
declaring 0
they 0
believed 0
Dr. 0
Christine 0
Ford's 0
allegations 0
against 0
him 0
while 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
obviously 0
not 0
believing 0
his 0
denial 0
of 0
the 0
allegations. 0

On 0
top 0
of 0
that, 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
zero 0
evidence 0
submitted 0
to 0
the 0
committee 0
that 0
Ford's 0
allegations 0
are 0
true. 0

In 0
fact, 0
everything 0
submitted 0
has 0
refuted 0
her 0
claims, 0
from 0
sworn 0
statements 0
by 0
those 0
she 0
claims 0
were 0
there 0
to 0
Kavanaugh's 0
calendar 0
to 0
character 0
statements 0
by 0
dozens 0
of 0
women 0
who 0
have 0
known 0
him 0
since 0
high 0
school 0
to 0
those 0
he 0
has 0
worked 0
with 0
in 0
DC. 0

All 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
named 0
by 0
Ford 0
have 0
already 0
submitted 0
statements 0
that 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
memory 0
of 0
the 0
event 0
ever 0
occurring, 0
including 0
a 0
female 0
friend 0
of 0
hers 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

Two 0
of 0
those 0
named 0
have 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
cooperate 0
with 0
the 0
FBI. 0

“I 0
will 0
cooperate 0
with 0
any 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agency 0
that 0
is 0
assigned 0
to 0
confidentially 0
investigate 0
these 0
allegations,” 0
Kavanaugh 0
friend 0
Mark 0
Judge 0
said. 0

“My 0
client, 0
Patrick 0
J. 0
Smyth, 0
is 0
happy 0
to 0
cooperate 0
fully 0
with 0
this 0
FBI 0
investigation,” 0
said 0
attorney 0
Eric 0
B. 0
Bruce. 0

Kavanaugh 0
also 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
cooperating 0
as 0
he 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

“Throughout 0
this 0
process, 0
I’ve 0
been 0
interviewed 0
by 0
the 0
FBI, 0
I’ve 0
done 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
‘background’ 0
calls 0
directly 0
with 0
the 0
Senate, 0
and 0
yesterday, 0
I 0
answered 0
questions 0
under 0
oath 0
about 0
every 0
topic 0
the 0
Senators 0
and 0
their 0
counsel 0
asked 0
me," 0
Kavanaugh 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
that 0
was 0
released 0
by 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

"I’ve 0
done 0
everything 0
they 0
have 0
requested 0
and 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
cooperate." 0

Well, 0
Senator 0
Flake 0
has 0
given 0
the 0
Democrats 0
what 0
they 0
wanted 0
and 0
you 0
can 0
bet 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
still 0
going 0
to 0
vote 0
pretty 0
much 0
on 0
party 0
lines 0
concerning 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Now, 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
gone 0
along 0
with 0
it. 0

My 0
guess 0
is 0
that 0
one 0
of 0
two 0
things 0
will 0
occur 0
with 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigation: 0
(1) 0
Absolutely 1
nothing 1
will 1
be 1
found, 1
and 0
this 0
will 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
huge 1
waste 1
of 1
time 1
or 0
(2) 0
look 0
for 0
this 0
thing 0
to 0
expand 0
and 0
the 0
need 0
will 0
arise 0
to 0
make 0
this 0
more 1
of 1
a 1
circus 1
than 1
it 1
already 1
is, 1
which 0
will 0
dwarf 0
anything 0
Clarence 0
Thomas 0
had 0
to 0
face 0
from 0
the 0
slanderous 1
accusations 0
of 0
Anita 0
Hill. 0

Remember, 0
whether 0
you 0
like 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh 0
or 0
not, 0
this 0
has 0
been 0
nothing 0
but 0
a 0
political 1
hit. 1

Pope 0
Francis 0
Denounces 0
“Murderous 1
Indifference” 1
To 0
Persecution 0
Of 0
Christians, 0
Of 0
Which 0
He 0
Is 0
A 0
Chief 0
Architect 0

Associated 0
Press 0
reported 0
that 0
the 0
Ecumenical 0
Patriarch 0
Bartholomew 0
and 0
other 0
Orthodox 0
Patriarchs 0
met 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
Saturday, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
had 0
some 0
strong 0
words 0
to 0
say 0
about 0
the 0
persecution 0
of 0
Christians 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

The 0
Pope 0
couldn’t 1
resist 1
an 1
anti-Semitic 1
shot 1
at 1
Israeli 1
“occupation,” 1
but 0
he 0
also 0
seemed 0
to 0
denounce 0
Islamic 0
jihad 0
activity, 0
saying: 0
“So 0
many 0
conflicts 0
have 0
been 0
stoked 0
too 0
by 0
forms 0
of 0
fundamentalism 0
and 0
fanaticism 0
that, 0
under 0
the 0
guise 0
of 0
religion, 0
have 1
profaned 1
God’s 1
name 1
– 0
which 0
is 0
peace 0
– 0
and 0
persecuted 0
age-old 0
neighbors.” 0
He 1
decried 1
the 0
“thirst 0
for 0
profit 0
that 0
surreptitiously 0
exploits 0
oil 0
and 0
gas 0
fields 0
without 0
regard 0
for 0
our 0
common 0
home, 0
with 0
no 0
scruples 0
about 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
energy 0
market 0
now 0
dictates 0
the 0
law 0
of 0
coexistence 0
among 0
peoples!” 0

The 0
Pope 0
lamented 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
has 0
been 0
“covered 0
by 0
dark 0
clouds 0
of 0
war, 0
violence 0
and 0
destruction, 0
instances 0
of 0
occupation 0
and 0
varieties 0
of 0
fundamentalism, 0
forced 0
migration 0
and 0
neglect.” 0
And 0
he 1
deplored 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
“all 0
this 0
has 0
taken 0
place 0
amid 0
the 0
complicit 0
silence 0
of 0
many. 0

The 0
Middle 0
East 0
has 0
become 0
a 0
land 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
leave 0
their 0
own 0
lands 0
behind.” 0
He 0
cried: 0
“Indifference 1
kills, 1
and 0
we 0
desire 0
to 0
lift 0
up 0
our 0
voices 0
in 0
opposition 0
to 0
this 0
murderous 1
indifference. 1

For 0
the 1
Middle 1
East 1
today 1
is 1
weeping, 1
suffering 1
and 1
silent 1
as 1
others 1
trample 1
upon 1
those 1
lands 1
in 0
search 0
of 0

These 1
are 1
odd 1
statements 1
coming 1
from 1
Pope 1
Francis, 1
a 1
world-class 1
Islamopanderer; 1
notice 1
that 1
he 1
said 1
nothing 1
about 1
who 1
was 1
doing 1
the 1
persecuting, 1
and 1
implied 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
the 1
fault 1
of 1
powers 1
outside 1
the 1
Middle 1
East. 1

The 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
as 0
a 0
whole 0
has 0
committed 0
itself 0
to 0
Islamopandering, 0
such 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
largely 0
silent 0
about 0
the 0
Muslim 0
persecution 0
of 0
Christians 0
that 0
has 0
taken 0
place 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

Why? 0

The 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
is 1
following 1
Pope 1
Francis’ 1
lead, 1
and 1
Francis 1
has 1
said: 1
“Christian 1
terrorism 1
does 1
not 1
exist, 1
Jewish 1
terrorism 1
does 1
not 1
exist, 1
and 1
Muslim 1
terrorism 1
does 1
not 1
exist. 1

They 1
do 1
not 1
exist.” 1
And 1
he 1
has 1
also 1
said: 1
“Authentic 1
Islam 1
and 1
the 1
proper 1
reading 1
of 1
the 1
Koran 1
are 1
opposed 1

Jean-Clément 0
Jeanbart, 0
the 0
Melkite 0
Greek 0
Catholic 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Aleppo, 0
gave 0
an 0
interview 0
to 0
a 0
French 0
reporter 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
was 0
highly 0
critical 0
of 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
and 0
even 0
of 0
his 0
fellow 0
bishops 0
for 0
ignoring 0
the 0
Muslim 0
persecution 0
of 0
Middle 0
Eastern 0
Christians. 0

“The 0
European 0
media,” 0
he 0
charged, 0
“have 0
not 0
ceased 0
to 0
suppress 0
the 0
daily 0
news 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
suffering 0
in 0
Syria 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
even 0
justified 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
our 0
country 0
by 0
using 0
information 0
without 0
taking 0
the 0
trouble 0
to 0
verify 0
it.” 0
And 0
as 0
for 0
his 0
brother 0
bishops 0
in 0
France, 0
“the 0
conference 0
of 0
French 0
bishops 0
should 0
have 0
trusted 0
us, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
better 0
informed. 0

Why 1
are 1
your 1
bishops 1
silent 1
on 1
a 1
threat 1
that 1
is 1
yours 1
today 1
as 1
well? 1

Because 0
the 0
bishops 0
are 0
like 0
you, 0
raised 0
in 0
political 0
correctness. 0

But 0
Jesus 0
was 0
never 0
politically 0
correct, 0
he 0
was 0
politically 0
just!” 0

Archbishop 0
Jeanbart 0
was 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
to 0
say 0
this. 0

“Why, 1
we 1
ask 1
the 1
western 1
world, 1
why 1
not 1
raise 1
one’s 1
voice 1
over 1
so 1
much 1
ferocity 1
and 1
injustice?” 1
asked 0
Cardinal 0
Angelo 0
Bagnasco, 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Italian 0
Bishops 0
Conference 0
(CEI). 0

Syriac 0
Catholic 0
Patriarch 0
Ignatius 0
Ephrem 0
Joseph 0
III 0
Younan 0
himself 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
appealed 0
to 0
the 0
West“not 0
to 0
forget 0
the 0
Christians 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East.” 0
The 0
former 0
Melkite 0
Greek 0
Catholic 0
Patriarch 0
Gregory 0
III 0
has 0
also 0
said: 0
“I 0
do 0
not 0
understand 0
why 0
the 0
world 0
does 0
not 0
raise 0
its 0
voice 0
against 0
such 0
acts 1
of 1
brutality.” 1

But 0
Gregory 0
III 0
should 0
have 0
understood, 0
since 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
problem. 0

He 0
himself 0
said: 0
“No 1
one 1
defends 1
Islam 1
like 1
Arab 1
Christians.” 1
It 1
is 1
to 1
defend 1
Islam 1
that 1
Western 1
clerics 1
do 1
not 1
raise 1
their 1
voice 1
against 1
such 1
acts 1
of 1
brutality. 1

It 1
is 1
to 1
pursue 1
a 1
fruitless 1
and 1
chimerical 1
“dialogue” 1
that 1
bishops 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
and 1
Europe 1
keep 1
silent 1
about 1
Muslim 1
persecution 1
of 1
Christians, 1
and 1
enforce 1
that 1
silence 1
upon 1
others. 1

he 0
was 0
suppressing 0
a 0

at 0
a 0

conference 0
on 0
that 0
persecution: 0
“Talk 1
about 1
extreme, 1
militant 1
Islamists 1
and 1
the 1
atrocities 1
that 1
they 1
have 1

The 0

Alpha 0

a 0

The 0

allegations 0
by 0
Ellison’s 0
ex-girlfriend, 0
Karen 0
Monahan, 0
that 0
Ellison 0
domestically 0
abused 0
her 0
in 0
2016. 0

He 0
has 0
denied 0
the 0

repeatedly, 0
and 0
Monahan 0
has 0
continued 0
to 0
press 0
her 0
case 0
in 0
frequent 0
tweets 0
about 0

On 0
Sunday, 0
Monahan 0
tweeted 0
to 0
Ellison: 0
“This 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
away 0
and 0
you 0
are 0
making 0
it 0
worse 0
for 0
you, 0

dragging 0
her 0
off 0

which 0
he 0

did 0
not 0
happen. 0

She 0
has 0
declined 0
to 0
show 0
the 0
video, 0
saying 0
it 0
is 0
traumatizing. 1

She 0
also 0
told 0

she 0
misplaced 0
it. 0

Monahan 0
also 0
recently 0
released 0
a 0
medical 0
record 0
that 0
shows 0
she 0
told 0
a 0
doctor 0
in 0
2017 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
an 0
abusive 0
relationship 0
with 0
Ellison. 0

Ken 0
Martin, 0
the 0
chairman 0
of 0
the 0
Minnesota 0
DFL, 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
the 0
party’s 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
allegations 0
against 0
Ellison 0
will 0
be 0
finished 0
soon, 0
then 0
released 0
to 0
the 0
public. 0

An 0
external 0
investigator 0
was 0
hired 0
to 0
conduct 0
the 0
inquiry. 0

The 0
Star 0
Tribune 0
argued 0
that, 0
given 0
the 0
public 0
interest 0
around 0
that 0
situation 0
and 0
Kim 0
Ellison’s 0
public 0
support 0
of 0
her 0
ex-husband, 0
the 0
divorce 0
records 0
are 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
concern 0
to 0
voters. 0

Divorce 0
records 0
are 0
typically 0
public, 0
but 0
judges 0
will 0
often 0
agree 0
to 0
seal 0
them 0
if 0
both 0
parties 0
to 0
the 0
case 0
agree 0
and 0
no 0
one 0
else 0
objects. 0

The 0
Ellison 0
campaign 0
released 0
a 0
statement 0
from 0
Kim 0
Ellison 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
both 0
her 0
and 0
Keith 0
Ellison. 0

“Our 0
divorce 0
simply 0
isn’t 0
the 0
public’s 0
business, 0
and 0
therefore, 0
when 0
we 0
separated, 0
we 0
jointly 0
asked 0
the 0
court 0
to 0
seal 0
the 0
file. 0

Now, 0
one 0
month 0
before 0
a 0
closely 0
contested 0
election 0
for 0
Minnesota 0
Attorney 0
General, 0
a 0

wants 0
to 0
probe 0
our 0
divorce 0
file 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
something 0
to 0
use 0
against 0
Keith 0
in 0
this 0
race. 0

I 0
am 0
disappointed 0
that 0
the 0
Star 0

would 0
choose 0
to 0
file 0
this 0
motion.” 0

Julian 0
Assange 0

The 1
persecution 1
of 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
must 1
end. 1

Or 1
it 1
will 1
end 1
in 1
tragedy. 1

The 0
Australian 0
government 0
and 0
prime 0
minister 0
Malcolm 0
Turnbull 0
have 0
an 0
historic 0
opportunity 0
to 0
decide 0
which 0
it 0
will 0
be. 0

They 1
can 1
remain 1
silent, 1
for 1
which 1
history 1
will 1
be 1
unforgiving. 1

Or 1
they 1
can 1
act 1
in 1
the 1
interests 1
of 1
justice 1
and 1
humanity 1
and 1
bring 1
this 1
remarkable 1
Australian 1
citizen 1
home. 1

Assange 0
does 0
not 0
ask 0
for 0
special 0
treatment. 0

The 0
government 0
has 0
clear 0
diplomatic 0
and 0
moral 0
obligations 0
to 0
protect 0
Australian 0
citizens 0
abroad 0
from 0
gross 1
injustice: 1
in 0
Julian’s 0
case, 0
from 0
a 0
gross 1
miscarriage 1
of 1
justice 1
and 1
the 1
extreme 1
danger 1
that 1
await 1
him 1
should 0
he 0
walk 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
Ecuadorean 0

We 0

warrant 0
is 0
successful 0
— 0
a 0
United 0

Special 0
Rapporteur 0
called 0
it 0
torture. 0

I 0
know 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
well; 0
I 0
regard 0
him 0
as 0
a 0
close 0
friend, 0
a 1
person 1
of 1
extraordinary 1
resilience 1
and 1
courage. 1

I 0
have 0
watched 0
a 1

engulf 1
him, 1
endlessly, 1
vindictively, 1

him. 0

Last 0

Hillary 0

over 1
whom 1
she 1
fawned 1
as 0
“the 1
icon 1
for 1

This 0
was 0
the 0
same 0
Clinton 0
who 0
threatened 0
to 0
“obliterate 1
totally” 1
Iran 0
and, 0
who, 0
as 0

was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1

destruction 1
of 1
Libya 1
as 1
a 1
modern 1

with 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
40,000 0

Like 1
the 1

Iraq, 1
it 1

Libya 1

gloated 1
on 1
his 1
blog 1
that 0
“Scotland 0
Yard 0
may 0
get 0
the 0
last 0
laugh”. 0

The 0
question 0
is 0
why. 0

Julian 0
Assange 0
has 0
committed 0
no 0
crime. 0

He 0
has 0
never 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0

The 0

Katrin 0
Axelsson 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Longstaff 0
of 0

summed 0
it 0
up 0
when 0
they 0
wrote, 0
“The 0

are 0
a 0
smokescreen 0

which 0
a 0
number 0

that 1

This 0

was 0
lost 0

buried 0
in 0
a 1

that 0
disgracefully 0
associated 0
Assange 0
with 0

included 0
voices 0
who 0
described 0
themselves 0

evidence 0
of 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
document 0
released 0
by 0

Assange 0
is 0
on 0
a 1
“Manhunt 1

One 0

memo 0
says: 0

Seven 0

in 0

I 0
arranged 0
to 0
meet 0
a 0
prominent 0
Liberal 0
Member 0

the 0

Malcolm 0

deliver 0
a 0
letter 0
from 0
Gareth 0
Peirce, 0
Assange’s 0
lawyer, 0
to 0
the 0
government. 0

We 0
talked 0
about 0
his 0
famous 0
victory 0
— 0
in 0
the 0
1980s 0
when, 0
as 0
a 0
young 0
barrister, 0
he 0
had 0
fought 0
the 0
British 0

to 0
suppress 0
free 0
speech 0
and 0
prevent 0
the 0

a 0
WikiLeaks 0
of 0
the 0

it 0
revealed 0
the 0
crimes 0
of 0
state 0

The 0
prime 0
minister 0
of 0
Australia 0
was 0
then 0
Julia 0
Gillard, 0
a 0
Labor 0
Party 0
politician 0
who 0
had 0
declared 0
WikiLeaks 0
“illegal” 0
and 0
wanted 0
to 0
cancel 0
Assange’s 0
passport 0
— 0
until 1
she 1
was 1
told 1
she 1
could 1
not 1
do 1
this: 1
that 1
Assange 1
had 1
committed 1
no 1
crime: 1
that 1
WikiLeaks 1
was 1
a 1
publisher, 1
whose 1
work 1
was 1
protected 1
under 1
Article 1
19 1
of 1
the 1
Universal 1
Declaration 1
of 1
Human 1
Rights, 1
to 1
which 1
Australia 1
was 1

of 1

signatories. 1

In 0
abandoning 0
Assange, 0
an 1
Australian 1
citizen, 1
and 0
colluding 0
in 0
his 0
persecution, 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Gillard’s 0
outrageous 1

forced 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
his 0
recognition, 0
under 0
international 0
law, 0
as 0
a 0
political 0
refugee 0
whose 0
life 0
was 0
at 0
risk. 0

Ecuador 0
invoked 0
the 0
1951 0
Convention 0

granted 0
Assange 0

it 0
a 0
warmongering, 1
sycophantic, 1

she 0
made 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
Congress 0
soon 0
after 0
she 0
demanded 0
the 0
illegal 0
cancellation 0
of 0
Julian’s 0
passport. 0

Malcolm 0
Turnbull 0
is 0
now 0
the 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
of 0
Australia. 0

Julian 0
Assange’s 0
father 0
has 0
written 0
to 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
moving 0
letter, 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
has 0
appealed 0
to 0
the 0

his 0

He 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
real 0

I 0
have 0

his 0

Malcolm 1

it 1

now 1
solidly 1

in 1
the 1

It 1
promotes 1
neo-liberalism 1

a 1
delves 1

about 1

says 0
the 1

His 0

declined 0
to 0
answer 0
the 0

The 0
piece 0

its 0
5.4 0
million 0
followers 0
one 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
hour 0
before 0
it 0
was 0
published. 0

The 0
Guardian 0
piece 0
came 0
at 0
a 0
critical 0
moment. 0

Currently 0
the 0
U.K. 0
and 0
Ecuador 0
conspire 0
to 0
deliver 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
to 0
U.S. 0
authorities. 0

On 0
Monday 0
special 0
counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
said 0
Manafort 0
lied 0
to 0
investigators, 0
violating 0
his 0
recent 0
plea 0
deal. 0

The 0
new 0
sensational 1
claim 1
was 0
immediately 0
picked 0
up 0
by 0
prominent 0
reporters 0
and 0
major 0
main 0
stream 0
outlets. 0

They 0
distributed 0
is 0
as 0
a 0
factual 0
account. 0

It 0
is 0
likely 0
that 0
millions 0
of 0
people 0
took 0
note 0
of 0
its 0
claim. 0

But 1
several 1
people 1
who 1
had 1
followed 1
the 1
Russiagate 1
fairytale 1
and 1
the 1
Mueller 1
investigation 1
were 1
immediately 1
suspicious 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian 1
claim. 1

The 1
story 1
was 1
weakly 1
sourced 1
and 1
included 1
some 1
details 1
that 1
seemed 1
unlikely 1
to 1
be 1
true. 1

Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
noted 0
that 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
embassy 0
is 0
under 0
heavy 0
CCTV 0
surveillance. 0

There 0
are 0
several 0
guards, 0
and 0
visitors 0
have 0
to 0
provide 0
their 0
identity 0
to 0
enter 0
it. 0

Every 0
visit 0
is 0
logged. 0

If 0
Manafort 0
had 0
really 0
visited 0
Assange, 0
it 0
would 0
have 0
long 0
been 0
known: 0

In 1
sum, 1
the 1
Guardian 1
published 1
a 1
story 1
today 1
that 1
it 1
knew 1
would 1
explode 1
into 1
all 1
sorts 1
of 1
viral 1
benefits 1
for 1
the 1
paper 1
and 1
its 1
reporters 1
even 1
though 1
there 1
are 1
gaping 1
holes 1
and 1
highly 1
sketchy 1
aspects 1
to 1
the 1
story. 1

Moreover, 1
the 1
main 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
story, 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
is 1
known 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
notorious 1
fraud, 1
a 1
russo-phobe 1
intelligence 1
asset 1
with 1
a 1
personal 1
grievance 1
towards 1
Assange 1
and 1
Wikileaks. 1

A 0

From 0

Harding: 0

The 0
people 0
who 0
promote 0
the 1
"Russian 1
influence" 1
nonsense 1
are 0
political 1
operatives 1
or 1
hacks. 1

Take 1
for 1
example 1
Luke 1
Harding 1
of 1
the 1
Guardian 1
who 1
just 1
published 1
a 1
book 1
titled 1
Collusion: 1
Secret 1
Meetings, 1
Dirty 1
Money, 1
and 1
How 1
Russia 1
Helped 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
Win. 1

He 1
was 1
taken 1
apart 1
in 1
a 1
Real 1
News 1
interview 1
(vid) 1
about 1
the 1
book. 1

The 1
interviewer 1
pointed 1
out 1
that 1
there 1
is 1
absolutely 1
no 1
evidence 1
in 1
the 1
book 1
to 1
support 1
its 1
claims. 1

When 1
asked 1
for 1
any 1
proof 1
for 1
his 1
assertion 1
Harding 1
defensively 1
says 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
just 1
"storytelling" 1
- 1
in 1
other 1
words: 1
it 1
is 1
fiction. 1

Harding 1
earlier 1
wrote 1
a 1
book 1
about 1
Edward 1
Snowden 1
which 1
was 1
a 1
similar 1
sham. 1

Julian 1
Assange 1
called 1
it 1
"a 1
hack 1
job 1
in 1
the 1
purest 1
sense 1
of 1
the 1
term". 1

Harding 1
is 1
also 1
known 1
as 1
plagiarizer. 1

When 1
he 1
worked 1
in 1
Moscow 1
he 1
copied 1
stories 1
and 1
passages 1
from 1
the 1
now 1
defunct 1
Exile, 1
run 1
by 1
Matt 1
Taibbi 1
and 1
Mark 1
Ames. 1

The 1
Guardian 1
had 1
to 1
publish 1
an 1
apology. 1

The 1
new 1
Guardian 1
story 1
looked 1
like 1
another 1
weak 1
attempt 1
to 1
connect 1
the 1
alleged 1
Russian 1
malfeasance 1
with 1
Assange 1
and 1
the 1
Wikileaks 1
publishing 1
of 1
the 1
DNC 1
emails. 1

Assange 1
and 1
other 1
involved 1
people 1
deny 1
that 1
such 1
a 1
relation 1
existed. 1

There 1
is 1
no 1
public 1
evidence 1
that 1
support 1
such 1
claims. 1

Shortly 0
after 0
the 0
Guardian's 0
fake 0
news 0
story 0
went 0
public 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
issued 0
an 0
unequivocal 0
denial: 0

“I 0
have 0
never 0
met 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
or 0
anyone 0
connected 0
to 0
him,” 0
the 0
statement 0
said. 0

“I 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
contacted 0
by 0
anyone 0
connected 0
to 0
Wikileaks, 0
either 0
directly 0
or 0
indirectly. 0

I 1
have 1
never 1
reached 0
out 0
to 0
Assange 0
or 0
Wikileaks 0
on 0
any 0
matter. 0

We 0

from 0

the 0

prior 0

Neither 0
responded 0

taking 0
place. 0

We 0
have 0
since 0
updated 0
the 0
story 0
to 0
reflect 0
their 0
denials. 0

This 1
defensive 1
Guardian 1
claim 1
is, 1
like 1
its 1
story, 1
evidently 1
completely 1
false. 1

Wikileaks 1
publicly 1
denied 1
the 1
Guardian's 1
claims 1
90 1
minutes 1
before 1
the 1
story 1
was 1
first 1
published. 1

Manafort 1
asserts 1
that 1
his 1
lawyers 1
had 1
notified 1
the 1
Guardian 1
that 1
the 1
story 1
was 1
false 1
before 1
the 1
Guardian 1
'proceeded 1

the 1

At 0
21:05 0

a 0
third 0

published 0
which 0
included 0
Manafort's 0
denial. 0

Half 0
an 0
hour 0
later 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
instructed 0
his 0
lawyers 0
to 0
sue 0
the 0
Guardian 0
for 0
libel. 0

Wikileaks 0
opened 0
a 0
fund 0
to 0
support 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

A 0
day 0
after 0
the 0
Guardian 1
smear 1
piece 1
the 0
Washington 0
Times 0
reported 0
that 0
Manafort's 0
passports, 0
entered 0
into 0
evidence 0
by 0
the 0
Mueller 0
prosecution, 0
show 0
that 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
visit 0
London 0
in 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
years 0
the 0
Guardian 0
claimed 0
he 0
was 0
there 0
to 0
visit 0
Assange. 0

The 1
story 1
was 1
completely 1
false 1
and 1
the 1
Guardian 1
knew 1
it 1
was. 1

It 1
disregarded 1
and 1
left 1
out 1
the 1
denials 1
the 1
subjects 1
of 1
the 1
story 1
had 1
issued 1
before 1
it 1
was 1
published. 1

The 1

Guardian 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
main 1
outlet 1
for 1
British 1
government 1
disinformation 1
operations 1
aimed 1
at 1
defaming 1
Russia. 1

It 1
smeared 1
Assange 1
and 1
Snowden 1
as 1
Russian 1
collaborators. 1

It 1
uncritically 1
peddled 1
the 1
Russiagate 1
story 1
and 1
the 1
nonsensical 1
Skripal 1
claims 1
which 1
are 1
both 1
obviously 1
concocted 1
by 1
British 1
intelligence 1
services. 1

That 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
become 1
its 1
main 1
purpose. 1

As 0
Disobediant 0
Media 0
notes 0
(emphasis 0
in 0
the 0
original): 0

While 1
most 1
readers 1
with 1
functional 1
critical 1
thinking 1
capacity 1
may 1
readily 1
dismiss 1
the 1
Guardian’s 1
smear 1
on 1
its 1
face, 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
published 1
this 1
piece, 1
and 1
that 1
Luke 1
Harding 1
is 1
still 1
operating 1
with 1
even 1
the 1
tiniest 1
modicum 1
of 1
respect 1
as 1
a 1
journalist 1
despite 1
his 1
history 1
of 1
deceit, 1
tells 1
us 1
something 1
bone-chilling 1
about 1
journalism. 1

It 1
is 1
no 1
accident 1
that 1
Luke 1
Harding 1
is 1
still 1
employed: 1
in 1
fact, 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
of 1
Harding’s 1
consistent 1
loyalty 1
to 1
establishment, 1
specifically 1
the 1
UK 1
intelligence 1
apparatus, 1
over 1
the 1
truth 1
that 1
determines 1
his 1
“success” 1
amongst 1
legacy 1
press 1
outlets. 1

Harding 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
defacement 1
or 1
a 1
departure 1
from 1
the 1
norm, 1
but 1
the 1
personification 1
of 1
it. 1

Jonathan 0
Cook, 0
a 0
former 0
Guardian 0
writer, 0
makes 0
a 0
similar 0
point: 0

The 0
truth 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Guardian 0
has 0
not 0
erred 0
in 0
this 0
latest 0
story 0
attacking 0
Assange, 0
or 0
in 0
its 0
much 0
longer-running 0
campaign 0
to 1
vilify 1
him. 1

With 1
this 1
story, 1
it 1
has 1
done 1
what 1
it 1
regularly 1
does 1
when 1
supposedly 1
vital 1
western 1
foreign 1
policy 1
interests 1
are 1
at 1
stake 1
– 1
it 1
simply 1
regurgitates 1
an 1
elite-serving, 1
western 1
narrative. 1

Its 1
job 1
is 1
to 1
shore 1
up 1
a 1
consensus 1
on 1
the 1
left 1
for 1
attacks 1
on 1
leading 1
threats 1
to 1
the 1
existing, 1
neoliberal 1
order: 1
... 1

The 1
Guardian 1
did 1
not 1
make 1
a 1
mistake 1
in 1
vilifying 1
Assange 1
without 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
evidence. 1

It 1
did 1
what 1
it 1
is 1
designed 1
to 1
do. 1

We 1
have 1
previously 1
shown 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
even 1
uses 1
fascist 1
propaganda 1
tropes 1
to 1
smear 1
the 1
Russian 1
people. 1

It 1
is 1
openly 1
publishing 1
Goebbels' 1
cartoons 1
and 1
rhetoric 1
against 1
Europes 1
biggest 1
state. 1

There 1
is 1
no 1
longer 1
any 1
line 1
that 1
it 1
does 1
not 1
dare 1
to 1
cross. 1

Unfortunately 1
other 1
'western' 1
media 1
are 1
not 1
much 1
better. 1

Within 0
hours 0
of 0
being 0
published 0
the 0
Guardian 0
piece 0
was 0
debunked 0
as 0
fake 0
news. 0

That 0
did 0
not 0
hinder 0
other 0
outlets 0
to 0
add 0
to 0
its 0
smear. 1

Politico 1
allowed 1
"a 1
former 1
CIA 1
officer," 1
writing 1
under 1
a 1
pen 1
name, 1
to 1
suggest 1
- 1
without 1
any 1
evidence 1
- 1
that 1
the 1
Guardian 1
has 1
been 1
duped 1
- 1
not 1
by 1
its 1
MI5/6 1
and 1
Ecuadorian 1
spy 1
sources, 1
but 1
by 1
Russian 1
disinformation: 1

Rather 0
than 0
being 0
the 1
bombshell 1
smoking 1
gun 1
that 1
directly 1
connects 1
the 1
Trump 1
campaign 1
to 1
WikiLeaks, 1
perhaps 0
the 0
report 0
is 0
something 0
else 0
entirely: 0
a 1
disinformation 1
campaign. 1

Is 1
it 1
possible 1
someone 1
planted 1
this 1
story 1
as 1
a 1
means 1
to 1
discredit 1
the 1
journalists? 1

... 0

Harding 0
is 0
likely 0
a 0
major 0
target 0
for 0
anyone 0
wrapped 0
up 0
in 0
Russia’s 0
intelligence 0
operation 0
against 0
the 0
West’s 0
democratic 0
institutions. 0

... 0

If 0
this 0
latest 0
story 0
about 0
Manafort 0
and 0
Assange 0
is 0
false—that 0
is, 0
if, 0
for 0
example, 0
the 0
sources 0
lied 0
to 0
Harding 0
and 0
Collyns 0
(or 0
if 0
the 0
sources 0
themselves 0
were 0
lied 0
to 0
and 0
thus 0
thought 0
they 0
were 0
being 0
truthful 0
in 0
their 0
statements 0
to 0
the 0
journalists), 0
or 0
if 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
intelligence 0
document 0
is 0
a 0
fake, 0
the 0
most 0
logical 0
explanation 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
make 0
Harding 0
look 0
bad. 0

The 1
is 1
zero 1
evidence 1
in 1
the 1
Politico 1
screed 1
that 1
supports 1
its 1
suggestions 1
and 1
claims. 1

It 1
is 1
fake 1
news 1
about 1
a 1
fake 1
news 1
story. 1

It 0
also 0
included 0
the 0
false 0
claim 0
that 0
Glenn 0
Greenwald 0
worked 0
with 0
Wikileaks 0
on 0
the 0
Snowden 0
papers. 0

That 0
claim 0
was 0
later 0
removed. 0

We 0
have 0
seen 0
a 0
similar 0
pattern 0
in 0
the 0
Skripal 0
affair. 0

When 0
'western' 0
intelligence 0
get 0
caught 0
in 0
spreading 0
disinformation, 0
they 0
accuse 0
Russia 0
of 0
being 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
fake. 0

Unfortunately 1
no 1
western 1
main 1
stream 1
media 1
can 1
any 1
longer 1
be 1
trusted 1
to 1
publish 1
the 1
truth. 1

The 0
Guardian 0
is 0
only 0
one 0
of 0
many 0
which 0
peddle 1
smears 1
and 0
disinformation 0
about 0
the 1
'enemies' 1
of 1
the 1
ruling 1
'western 1

It 1
is 1
on 1
all 1

to 1
debunk 1

The 0

authored 0

emphasizing 0

something 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
opposed 0
when 0
popular 0

gripped 0
Iran 0

The 0
regime 0
change 0
plan 0
seeks 0
to 0
fundamentally 0
shift 0
U.S. 0
policy 0
towards 0
Iran 0
and 0
has 0
found 0
a 0
receptive 0
audience 0
in 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
moving 0
in 0
this 0
direction 0
since 0
Bolton—a 0
longtime 0
and 0
vocal 0
supporter 0
of 0
regime 0
change—entered 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

Ah, 0
yes, 0
John 0
Bolton. 0

While 0
I 0
applaud 0
Bolton 0
for 0
his 0
willingness 0
to 0
call 0
Islamic 0
jihadis 0
just 0
that, 0
I 0
am 0
not 0
so 0
naive 0
as 0
to 0
consider 0
that 0
his 0
membership 0
in 0
the 0
Council 0
on 0
Foreign 0
Relations 0
has 0
no 0
effect 0
in 0
this 0
decision. 0

"The 0
ordinary 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
are 0
suffering 0
under 0
economic 0
stagnation, 0
while 0
the 0
regime 0
ships 0
its 0
wealth 0
abroad 0
to 0
fight 0
its 0
expansionist 0
wars 0
and 0
to 0
pad 0
the 0
bank 0
accounts 0
of 0
the 0
Mullahs 0
and 0
the 0
IRGC 0
command," 0
SSG 0
writes 0
in 0
the 0
paper. 0

"This 0
has 0
provoked 0
noteworthy 0
protests 0
across 0
the 0
country 0
in 0
recent 0
months." 0

Well, 0
why 0
is 0
that? 0

It's 0
due 0
to 0
sanctions 0
imposed 0
by 0
the 0
likes 0
of 0
the 0
US. 0

As 0
has 0
been 0
pointed 0
out 0
before, 0
sanctions 0
hurt 0
the 0
people, 0
not 0
the 0
governments 0
that 0
lead 0
them 0
and 0
then 0
those 0
same 0
governments 0
use 0
the 0
effects 0
to 0
propagandize 0
the 0
people 0
against 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
ordering 0
the 0
sanctions. 0

I'm 0
not 0
saying 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government 0
is 0
good, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
Iran's 0
government. 0

Honestly, 0
I 0
see 0
a 0
ton 0
of 0
corruption 0
and 0
warmongering 0
in 0
our 0
own 0
government 0
that 0
rivals 0
some 0
of 0
that 0
of 0
governments 0
that 0
America 0
stands 0
against. 0

Still, 0
as 0
was 0
pointed 0
out 0
by 0
Matt 0
Agorist, 0
Bolton 0

“There 0
is 0
a 0
viable 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
the 0
ayatollahs, 0
and 0
that 0
opposition 0
is 0
centered 0
in 0
this 0
room 0
today. 0

I 0
had 0
said 0
for 0
over 0
10 0
years 0
since 0
coming 0
to 0
these 0
events, 0
that 0
the 0
declared 0
policy 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
of 0
America 0
should 0
be 0
the 0
overthrow 0
of 0
the 0
mullahs’ 0
regime 0
in 0
Tehran. 0

The 0
behavior 0
and 0
the 0
objectives 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
are 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
change, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 1
only 1
solution 1
is 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
regime 0
itself. 0

And 0
that’s 0
why, 0
before 0
2019, 0
we 0
here 0
will 0
celebrate 0
in 0
Tehran!” 0

And 0
again, 0
this 0
really 0
has 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
US. 0

One 0
source 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
who 0
has 0
previewed 0
the 0
plan 0
told 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
that 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
also 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
solidified 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
grip 0
on 0
power 0
and 0
intentionally 0
prevented 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
from 0
fomenting 0
regime 0
change. 0

“The 0
JCPOA 0
purposefully 0
destroyed 0
the 0
carefully 0
created 0
global 0
consensus 0
against 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic,” 0
said 0
the 0
source, 0
who 0
would 0
only 0
speak 0
to 0
the 0
Free 0
Beacon 0
on 0
background 0
about 0
the 0
sensitive 0
issue. 0

“Prior 0
to 0
that, 0
everyone 0
understood 0
the 0
dangers 0
of 0
playing 0
footsie 0
with 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
state 0
sponsor 0
of 0
terrorism. 0

It’s 0
now 0
Trump, 0
Bolton, 0
and 0
[Mike] 0
Pompeo’s 0
job 0
to 0
put 0
this 0
consensus 0
back 0
in 0
place.” 0

The 0
source 0
told 0
the 0
Beacon 0
that 0
Bolton 0
is 0
“acutely 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
danger 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
poses 0
to 0
the 0
region.” 0

“John 0
is 0
someone 0
who 0
understands 0
the 0
danger 0
of 0
Iran 0
viscerally, 0
and 0
knows 0
that 0
you’re 0
never 0
going 0
to 0
fundamentally 0
change 0
its 0
behavior—and 0
the 0
threats 0
against 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Saudis 0
especially—until 0
that 0
revolutionary 0
regime 0
is 0
gone,” 0
the 0
source 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
“nothing’s 0
off 0
the 0
table 0
right 0
now 0
if 0
Israel 0
is 0
attacked.” 0

OK, 0
I 0
get 0
they 0
may 0
pose 0
a 0
danger, 0
but 0
let's 0
look 0
at 0
the 0
reality 0
here. 0

Those 0
they 0
pose 0
a 0
danger 0
to, 0
namely 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
and 0
Israel 0
can 0
both 0
fend 0
perfectly 0
well 0
for 0
themselves 0
and 0
have 0
demonstrated 0
that 0
ability 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
need 0
for 0
the 0
US 0
to 0
be 0
involved 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
any 0
way. 0

Why 0
should 0
we 0
be 0
fighting 0
a 0
battle 0
or 0
encouraging, 0
funding, 0
and 0
I'm 0
quite 0
sure 0
arming, 0
a 0
rebellion? 0

Where 0
is 0
that 0
authorized 0
in 0
our 1
Constitution? 1

Simple. 0

It 0
isn't. 0

I 0
care 0
little 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
government 0
as 0
they 0
help 0
push 0
Sharia 0
and 0
is 0
the 0
land 0
where 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
9-11 0
hijackers 0
came 0
from. 0

The 0
Iranian 0
government 0
I 0
care 0
for 0
even 0
less, 0
but 0
out 0
of 0
each 0
of 0
those, 0
which 0
one 0
should 0
America 0
have 0
dealt 0
with 0
militarily 0
following 0
9-11? 0

Both, 0
if 0
you're 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
by 0
information 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
record 0
on. 0

Why 0
can't 0
America 0
focus 0
on 0
it's 0
own 0
issues 0
and 0
solve 0
those? 0

It's 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
too 0
busy 0
trying 0
to 0
police 0
the 0
world, 0
keeping 0
the 0
spotlight 0
off 0
of 0
those 0
in 0
our 0
government 0
who 0
are 0
attacking 0
our 0
rights 0
and 0
spending 0
us 0
into 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
debt. 0

And 0
lest 0
you 0
think 0
this 0
is 0
about 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

It 0
isn't. 0

“The 0
problem 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
Iran 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
it’s 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime,” 0
the 0
source 0
told 0
the 0
Beacon. 0

“Team 0
Bolton 0
has 0
spent 0
years 0
creating 0
Plans 0
B, 0
C, 0
and 0
D 0
for 0
dealing 0
with 0
that 0
problem. 0

President 0
Trump 0
hired 0
him 0
knowing 0
all 0
of 0
that. 0

The 0
administration 0
will 0
now 0
start 0
aggressively 1
moving 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
root 0
cause 0
of 0
chaos 0
and 0
violence 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
in 0
a 0
clear-eyed 0
way.” 0

Bolton 0
says 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
accomplished 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
six 0
months. 0

I 1
don't 1
doubt 1
it. 1

This 0
will 0
probably 0
end 0
up 0
being 0
another 0
Ukraine 0
situation, 0
something 0
we 0
just 0
don't 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
in, 0
and 0
yes, 0
I 0
know, 0
I'll 0
be 0
called 0
a 0
liberal 0
but 0
honest 1
readers 0
who 0
have 0
followed 0
me 0
for 0
some 0
time 0
know 0
that's 0
not 0
the 0
case. 0

Notice 0
some 0
things 0
that 0
are 0
taking 0
place 0
in 0
Iran 0
that 0
the 0
plan 0
speaks 0
about. 0

“More 0
than 0
one 0
third 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
population 0
is 0
minority 0
groups, 0
many 0
of 0
whom 0
already 0
seek 0
independence,” 0
the 0
paper 0
explains. 0

“U.S. 0

support 0
for 0
these 0
independence 0
movements, 0
both 0
overt 0
and 0
covert, 0
could 0
force 0
the 0
regime 0
to 0
focus 0
attention 0
on 0
them 0
and 0
limit 0
its 0
ability 0
to 0
conduct 0
other 0
malign 0
activities.” 0

“The 0
probability 0
the 0
current 0
Iranian 0
theocracy 0
will 0
stop 0
its 0
nuclear 0
program 0
willingly 0
or 0
even 0
under 0
significant 0
pressure 0
is 0
low,” 0
the 0
plan 0
states. 0

“Absent 0
a 0
change 0
in 0
government 0
within 0
Iran, 0
America 1
will 1
face 1
a 1
choice 1
between 1
accepting 1
a 1
nuclear-armed 1
Iran 1
or 1
acting 1
to 1
destroy 1
as 1
much 1
of 1
this 1
capability 1
as 1
possible.” 1

President 0
Trump 0
did 0
made 0
clear 0
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
week 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
make 0
efforts 0
to 0
differentiate 0
between 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
Iran 0
and 0
its 0
ruling 0
regime. 0

Well, 0
I 0
agree, 0
but 0
that 0
gets 0
real 0
messy 0
when 0
you 0
start 0
intervening 0
in 0
this 0
manner. 0

“Any 0
public 0
discussion 0
of 0
these 0
options, 0
and 0
any 0
messaging 0
about 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
in 0
general, 0
should 0
make 0
a 0
bright 0
line 0
distinction 0
between 0
the 0
theocratic 0
regime 0
along 0
with 0
its 0
organs 0
of 0
oppression 0
and 0
the 0
general 0
populace,” 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
plan. 0

“We 0
must 0
constantly 0
reinforce 0
our 0
support 0
for 0
removing 0
the 0
iron 0
sandal 0
from 0
the 0
necks 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
to 0
allow 0
them 0
the 0
freedom 0
they 0
deserve.” 0

But 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
spoken 0
out 0
on 0
other 0
countries 0
where 0
the 0
people 0
want 0
their 0
independence. 0

Remember 0
the 0
Kurds? 0

How 0
about 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
Catalan 0
region 0
of 0
Spain? 0

No 0
support 0
for 0
those 0
people, 0
and 0
why? 0

Cause 0
it's 0
not 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
agenda. 0

I 0
say 0
if 0
the 0
Iranian 0
people 0
want 0
their 0
freedom, 0
let 0
them 0
first 0
free 0
themselves 0
from 0
the 0
bondage 0
of 0
Islam, 0
and 0
then 0
let 0
the 0
passion 0
that 0
burns 0
inside 0
men 0
to 0
be 0
free 0
rise 0
up 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
in 0
our 0
forefathers 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
teachings 0
fo 0
the 0
Holy 0
Scriptures 0
and 0
stand 0
and 0
fight. 0

Then, 0
they 0
will 0
be 0
in 0
a 0
position 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
aid, 0
but 0
only 0
then. 0

‘Suicide 0

last 0

when 0
photos 0
from 0

On 0
Thursday, 0
investigators 0
revealed 0
that 0
the 0
note 0
in 0
the 0
photo 0
was 0
not, 0
in 0
fact, 0
a 0
suicide 0
note 0
but 0
neglected 0
to 0
provide 0
further 0
details 0
about 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
the 0
note. 0

In 0
their 0
first 0
in-depth 0
interview, 0
which 0
will 0
air 0
on 0
CBS 0
Sunday 0
evening, 0
the 0
officers 0
who 0
stormed 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
hotel 0
room 0
revealed 0
new 0
details 0
to 0
60 0
Minutes 0
that 0
finally 0
explain 0
what 0
was 0
written 0
on 0
the 0
mysterious 0
note. 0

“I 0
could 0
see 0
on 0
it 0
he 0
had 0
written 0
the 0
distance, 0
the 0
elevation 0
he 0
was 0
on, 0
the 0
drop 0
of 0
what 0
his 0
bullet 0
was 0
gonna 0
be 0
for 0
the 0
crowd,” 0
said 0
Officer 0
Dave 0
Newton 0
from 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Police 0
in 0
a 0
preview 0
clip 0
of 0
Sunday’s 0
report. 0

“So 0
he 0
had 0
that 0
written 0
down 0
and 0
figured 0
out 0
so 0
he 0
would 0
know 0
where 0
to 0
shoot 0
to 0
hit 0
his 0
targets 0
from 0
there.” 0

Paddock’s 0
note 0
was 0
clearly 0
not 0
a 0
suicide 0
letter. 0

Rather, 0
it 0
detailed 0
bullet 0
trajectory 0
and 0
included 0
calculations 0
about 0
where 0
he 0
needed 0
to 0
aim 0
his 0
weapons 0
to 0
maximize 0
accuracy 0
and 0
optimize 0
his 0
kill 0
rate. 0

Investigators 0
have 0
also 0
been 0
looking 0
for 0
a 0
‘mystery 0
woman’ 0
who 0
was 0
seen 0
with 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
in 0
the 0
days 0
leading 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
shooting. 0

According 0
to 0
ABC 0
News, 0
the 0
‘mystery 0
woman’ 0
everyone 0
on 0
the 0
internet 0
was 0
talking 0
about 0
has 0
been 0
identified. 0

While 1
officials 1
did 1
not 1
reveal 1
the 1
woman’s 1
name, 1
they 1
did 1
tell 1
reporters 1
she 1
was 1
a 1
prostitute. 1

Police 0
are 0
still 0
investigating 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
Paddock 0
acted 0
alone. 0

They 0
believe 0
he 0
may 0
have 0
had 0
an 0
accomplice 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
elaborate 0
planning 0
needed 0
to 0
undertake 0
such 0
a 0
massacre 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
some 0
ammunition 1
was 1
purchased 1
under 1
someone 1
else’s 1
name. 1

As 0
ABC 0
reported 0
Friday 0
evening: 0

“Meantime, 0
investigators 0
are 0
still 0
trying 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
whether 0
Paddock 0
acted 0
alone. 0

Authorities 0
believe 0
he 0
may 0
have 0
had 0
an 0
accomplice, 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
elaborate 0
planning 0
on 0
Sunday 0
night’s 0
rampage. 0

Officials 0

also 0
believe 0
he 0
had 0
help 0
because 0
of 0
the 0
amount 0
of 0
guns 0
in 0
his 0
hotel 0
room, 0
and 0
because 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
ammo 1
was 1
bought 1
under 1
someone 1
else’s 1
name.” 1

Though 0
more 0
details 0
are 0
being 0
released 0
each 0
day, 0
Paddock’s 0
motives 0
remain 0
unclear. 0

of 0

Paul, 0

to 0
the 0
McCarrick 0

(The 0

Every 0
time 0

celebrated, 0
the 0
priest 0
prays 0
that 0
Jesus 0
will 0
“look 0
not 0

but 0
on 0
the 0
faith 0

That’s 0
been 0
an 0

in 0

that 0
I 0

Church. 0

I’ve 0
been 0
praying 0
that 0
prayer 0
even 0
more 0
earnestly 0
in 0
these 0
past 0
weeks 0
as 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
once 0
again 0
come 0
face-to-face 0
with 0
its 0
sins, 0
with 0
reports 0
that 0
former 0
cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
prominent 1
Churchmen 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
in 1
the 1
last 1
quarter 1
century, 1
has 0
been 0
accused 0
of 0
abusing 0
two 0
minors 0
and 0
sexually 0
harassing 0
or 0
assaulting 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
seminarians 0
and 0
young 0
priests. 0

To 1
make 1
matters 1
worse 1
(if 1
that 1
is 1
even 1
possible), 1
evidence 0
has 0
surfaced 0
that 0
indicates 0
that 0
a 0
bishop, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
some 0
priests 0
and 0
laity, 0
had 0
brought 0
the 0
allegations 0
about 0
misconduct 0
with 0
seminarians 0
to 0
the 0
attention 0
of 0
Church 0
authorities 0
but 0
to 0
no 0
avail: 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
nonetheless 0
“promoted” 0
to 0
become 0
the 0
archbishop 0
in 0
our 1
nation’s 1
capital, 0
and 0
elevated 0
to 0
the 0
College 0
of 0
Cardinals. 0

While 0
I 0
realize 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
always 0
easy 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
credibility 0
of 0
those 0
bringing 0
allegations, 0
and 0
that 0
there’s 0
often 0
a 0
tendency 0
to 0
believe 0
those 0
we 0
know 0
over 0
those 0
we 0
don’t, 0
I 1
don’t 1
think 1
that 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
will 1
rest 1
— 1
and 1
confidence 1
will 1
be 1
restored 1
— 1
until 1
the 1
matter 1
is 1
independently 1
investigated 1
and 1
explained, 1
and 1
assurances 1
are 1
given 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
safeguards 1
in 1
place 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
that 1
something 1
like 1
this 1
couldn’t 1
happen 1
again. 1

The 0
matter 0
has 0
been 0
particularly 0
troubling 0
to 0
me 0
personally 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
served 0
in 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
Newark 0
as 0
coadjutor 0
archbishop 0
from 0
November 0
4, 0
2013, 0
to 0
March 0
25, 0
2016, 0
when 0
I 0
was 0
named 0
archbishop 0
here. 0

It 0
was 0
while 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
Newark 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
introduced 0
to 0
then-Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

A 0
number 0
of 0
good 1
Catholics 1
have 0
written 0
to 0
ask 0
for 0
a 0
personal 0
accounting 0
on 0
my 0
part, 0
inquiring 0
whether 0
I 0
was 0
made 0
aware 0
in 0
my 0
time 0
in 0
Newark 0
of 0
the 0
2005 0
and 0
2007 0
settlements 0
involving 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick, 0
or 0
if 0
I 0
knew 0
of 0
any 0
allegations 0
against 0
him. 0

I 0
can 0
state 0
unequivocally 0
that 0
I 0
learned 0
of 0
those 0
settlements 0
only 0
in 0
June 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
as 0
news 0
broke 0
about 0
the 0
unrelated 0
claim 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
filed 0
in 0
the 0
Archdiocese 0
of 0
New 0
York. 0

What 0
I 0
know 0
of 0
the 0
settlements 0
I 0
know 0
from 0
the 0
newspapers. 0

When 0
serving 0
in 0
Newark, 0
I 0
was 0
regularly 0
briefed 0
on 0
current 0
legal 0
matters 0
of 0
all 0
sorts, 0
but 0
not 0
on 0
past 0
legal 0
matters 0
(unless 0
they 0
were 0
still 0
being 0
discussed 0
in 0
the 0
press). 0

By 0
the 0
time 0
I 0
arrived 0
in 0
Newark 0
in 0
November 0
2013, 0
the 1
2005 1
and 1
2007 1
settlements 1
were 1
apparently 1
considered 1
ancient 1
history. 1

It 0
would 0
be 0
untrue 0
to 0
state 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
never 0
heard 0
any 0
allegations 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick. 0

Years 0
before 0
I 0
ever 0
lived 0
in 0
Newark, 0
and 0
never 0
imagining 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
assigned 0
there, 0
I 0
had 0
indeed 0
read 0
— 0
as 0
a 1
somewhat 1
geeky 1
ex-lawyer 1
— 0
an 0
allegation 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
a 0
2005 0
lawsuit 0
in 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York 0
against 0
Archbishop 0
Myers, 0
Cardinal 0
Eagan, 0
Bishop 0
Hubbard 0
and 0
the 0
Irish 0
Christian 0
Brothers. 0

While 0
the 0
complaint 0
didn’t 0
supply 0
any 0
details, 0
the 0
plaintiff 0
was 0
reported 0
to 0
have 0
said 0
to 0
a 0
journalist 0
that 0
“Archbishop 0
McCarrick 0
would 0
share 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
seminarians 0
but 0
not 0
engage 0
in 0
any 0
activity 0
with 0
them.” 0
The 0
complaint 0
would 0
later 0
be 0
formally 0
amended 0
to 0
include 0
that 0
allegation. 0

Knowing, 0
however, 0
that 0
this 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
completely 0
dismissed 0
by 0
the 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
courts, 0
I 0
never 0
gave 0
the 0
particular 0
allegation 0
about 0
Cardinal 0
McCarrick 0
any 0
credence. 0

I 0
can 0
also 0
state 0
without 0
exception 0
that 0
no 0
one 0
in 0
my 0
years 0
in 0
Newark 0
ever 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
improperly 0
touched 0
by 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick, 0
and 0
no 0
one 0
ever 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
to 0
share 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
him 0
or 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
seen 0
anyone 0
share 0
a 0
bed 0
with 0
him. 0

I 0
heard 0
lots 0
of 0
gut-wrenching 1
stories 1
in 0
my 0
two-and-a-half 0
years 0
there, 0
but 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
involved 0
Archbishop 0
McCarrick. 0

With 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II’s 0
1995 0
visit, 0
he 0
was 0
remembered 0
for 0
“bringing 1
a 1
saint 1
to 1
Newark,” 1
not 0
as 0
an 1
abuser 1
of 1
seminarians, 1
minors 1
or 1
priests. 1

When 0
I 0
was 0
installed 0
here 0
in 0
St. 0
Paul, 0
he 0
joined 0
me 0
at 0
lunch 0
along 0
with 0
my 0
father, 0
sister, 0
godmother 0
and 0
then 0
12-year-old 0
nephew. 0

I 0
can 0
assure 0
you 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
never 0
have 0
allowed 0
that 0
to 0
happen 0
if 0
I 0
had 0
any 0
reason 0
to 0
know 0
or 0
even 0
suspect 0
the 0
things 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
reported 0
in 0
the 0
newspapers 0
this 0
past 0
month. 0

While 0
the 0
letters 0
and 0
emails 0
of 0
recent 0
days 0
are 0
sober 1
reminders 1
that 0
there’s 0
still 0
a 0
long 0
way 0
to 0
go 0
in 0
restoring 0
trust, 0
I 0
nonetheless 0
welcome 0
the 0
efforts 0
to 0
hold 0
me 0
accountable 0
to 0
you, 0
the 0
faithful 0
of 0
this 0
archdiocese. 0

The 0
events 0
of 0
these 0
past 0
weeks 0
have 0
shown 0
that 0
no 1
one 1
can 1
be 1
above 1
the 1
law, 1
regardless 1
of 1
rank 1
or 1
privilege. 1

I 0
was 0
grateful 0
for 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
reinforce 0
that 0
with 0
our 0
seminarians 0
this 0
past 0
weekend, 0
and 0
I 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
continuing 0
my 0
work 0
with 0
the 0
Office 0
of 0
Ministerial 0
Standards 0
and 0
Safe 0
Environment, 0
and 0
our 0
Archdiocesan 0
Review 0
Board, 0
in 0
creating 0
a 0
culture 0
in 0
which 0
no 0
one 0
need 0
be 0
afraid 0
or 0
reluctant 0
to 0
bring 0
forth 0
an 0
allegation 0
of 0
misconduct. 0

Our 0
heavenly 1
patron, 1
St. 0
Paul, 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
“where 0
sin 0
abounds, 0
grace 0
abounds 0
all 0
the 0
more.” 0
May 0
these 0
difficult 0
days 0
be 0
days 0
of 0
great 0
grace 0
for 0
this 0
local 0
Church. 0

REMNANT 0
COMMENT: 0
While 0
we 0
certainly 0
appreciate 0
His 0
Excellency's 0
candid 1
explanation 1
of 0
what 0
he 0
knew 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
know 0
about 0
this 0
horrific 1
scandal 1
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
we 1
would 1
also 1
humbly 1
beg 1
him 1
to 1
take 1
it 1
one 1
step 1
further 1
by 1
publicly 1
proclaiming 1
his 1
profession 1
of 1
belief 1
in 1
the 1
Church's 1
official 1
teaching 1
against 1
the 1
mortal 1
sin 1
of 1
homosexual 1
acts 1
and 1
the 1
so-called 1
"gay 1
lifestyle," 1
which 1
includes 1
her 1
long-held 1
teaching 1
that 1
homosexual 1
activity 1
between 1
clerics 1
is 1
an 1
ecclesiastical 1
crime. 1

Far 0
from 0
being 0
reassured 0
of 0
this 0
by 0
their 0
bishops, 0
many 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
today 0
are 0
informed 0
that 0
the 0
modern 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
is 0
now 0
an 1
"inclusive 1
community" 1
that 1
"welcomes 1
all" 1
and 1
"judges 1
none." 1

All 1
very 1
well 1
and 1
good, 1
except 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
the 1
Church's 1
constant 1
and 1
unchanging 1
moral 1
teaching 1
on 1
this 1
makes 1
no 1
such 1
allowance. 1

In 0
fact, 0
this 0
binding 0
and 0
constant 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
was 0
reaffirmed 0
most 0
recently 0
in 0
her 0
most 0
authoritative 0
modern 0
catechism, 0
which 0
holds 0
the 0
exact 0
opposite 0
position 0
from 0
that 0
apparently 0
held 0
by 0
many 0
bishops: 0

Homosexuality 0
refers 0
to 0
relations 0
between 0
men 0
or 0
between 0
women 0
who 0
experience 0
an 0
exclusive 0
or 0
predominant 0
sexual 0
attraction 0
toward 0
persons 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
sex... 0
Basing 1
itself 1
on 1
Sacred 1
Scripture, 1
which 1
presents 1
homosexual 1
acts 1
as 1
acts 1
of 1
grave 1
depravity, 1
tradition 1
has 1
always 1
declared 1
that 1
"homosexual 1
acts 1
are 1
intrinsically 1
disordered." 1

They 1
are 1
contrary 1
to 1
the 1
natural 1
law. 1

They 1
close 1
the 1
sexual 1
act 1
to 1
the 1
gift 1
of 1
life. 1

They 1
do 1
not 1
proceed 1
from 1
a 1
genuine 1
affective 1
and 1
sexual 1
complementarity. 1

Under 1
no 1
circumstances 1
can 1
they 1
be 1
approved. 1

(Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
2357) 0

Under 1
no 1
circumstances…except 1
for 1
those 1
dreamed 1
up 1
by 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
bishops 1
in 1
this 1
country 1
who 1
apparently 1
think 1
that 1
it 1
should 1
be 1
left 1
up 1
to 1
individual 1
parishes 1
to 1
decide 1
if 1
they 1
are 1
LGBTQ-friendly 1
or 1
not. 1

Even 0
Pope 1
John 1
Paul 1
"The 1
GREAT's" 1
Vatican 0
clarified 0
the 0
Church's 0
teaching 0
on 0
October 0
31, 0
1986, 0
in 0
the 0
“Letter 0
to 0
the 0
Bishops 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
on 0
the 0
Pastoral 0
Care 0
of 0
Homosexual 0
Persons”: 0

Although 0
the 0
particular 0
inclination 0
of 0
the 0
homosexual 0
person 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
sin, 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
strong 0
tendency 0
ordered 0
toward 0
an 0
intrinsic 0
moral 0
evil; 0
thus 1
the 1
inclination 1
itself 1
must 1
be 1
seen 1
as 1
an 1
objective 1
disorder. 1

Therefore 1
special 1
concern 1
and 1
pastoral 1
attention 1
should 1
be 1
directed 1
to 1
those 1
who 1
have 1
this 1
condition, 1
lest 1
they 1
be 1
led 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
living 1
out 1
of 1
this 1
orientation 1
in 1
homosexual 1
activity 1
is 1
a 1
morally 1
acceptable 1
option. 1

It 1
is 1
not. 1

Notice 0
the 0
late 0
pope 0
does 0
not 0
say, 0
“Let 0
the 0
practicing 0
homosexuals 0
have 0
a 0
spiritual 0
home 0
among 0
your 0
faithful,” 0
as 0
Father 0
James 0
Martin 0
and 0
his 0
episcopal 1
fans 1
are 0
at 0
least 0
implying 0
on 0
a 0
regular 0
basis 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

Does 0
Archbishop 0
Hebda 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
time 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
stop 1
humiliating 1
herself 1
by 1
stooping 1
to 1
accommodate 1
a 1
special 1
interest 1
group 1
that 1
obviously 1
doesn't 1
care 1
about 1
her 1
or 1
the 1
moral 1
code 1
by 1
which 1
she 1
governs? 1

Does 0
he 0
believe 0
that 0
all 0
Catholics 0
must 0
follow 0
the 0
rules 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
pertaining 0
to 0
the 0
Sixth 0
Commandment...or 0
just 0
the 1
straight 1
Catholics? 1

Does 0
His 0
Excellency 0
believe 0
that 0
if 0
some 0
homosexual 0
Catholics 0
feel 0
they 0
need 0
not 0
bother 0
following 0
the 0
rules 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
warmly 0
welcomed 0
into 0
our 0
"Catholic 0
Christian" 0
community 0
anyway, 0
even 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
in 0
same-sex 0
unions? 0

Pope 0
John 0
Paul 0
certainly 0
didn't 0
accept 0
that. 0

In 0
his 0
2005 0
book 0
Memory 0
and 0
Identity, 0
John 0
Paul 0
referred 0
to 0
homosexuality 0
as 0
an 1
“ideology 1
of 1
evil,” 1
insisting 0
of 0
so-called 0
'gay 0
marriage' 0
that: 0

“It 0
is 0
legitimate 0
and 0
necessary 0
to 0
ask 0
oneself 0
if 0
this 0
is 0
not 0
perhaps 0
part 0
of 0
a 1
new 1
ideology 1
of 1
evil, 1
perhaps 0
more 1
insidious 1
and 0
hidden, 0
which 0
attempts 0
to 1
pit 1
human 1
rights 1
against 1
the 1
family 1
and 1
man.” 1

Was 0
Pope 1
John 1
Paul 1
THE 1
GREAT 1
an 1
intolerant 1
homophobe? 1

Are 1
Father 1
Martin 1
and 1
his 1
pals 1
in 1
the 1
episcopacy 1
really 1
so 1
enlightened 1
over 1
every 1
pope, 1
saint, 1
and 1
moral 1
theologian 1
in 1
history? 1

Or 1
is 1
it 1
not 1
so 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
both 1
negligent 1
and 1
uncharitable 1
for 1
some 1
bishops 1
to 1
refuse 1
to 1
inform 1
their 1
faithful 1
that 1
according 1
to 1
the 1
Church's 1
own 1
infallible 1
teaching, 1
everlasting 1
damnation 1
is 1
the 1
price 1
to 1
be 1
paid 1
for 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
inclusivity 1
and 1
toleration? 1

And 0
if 0
the 0
episcopal 0
retort 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
that 0
this 0
acceptance 0
refers 0
only 0
to 0
chaste 0
homosexuals, 0
then 0
we 1
call 1
FOUL 1
even 1
louder 1
since 0
this 0
crosses 0
the 0
line 0
into 0
willful 1
deception. 1

We're 1
all 1
sinners, 1
of 1
course--- 1
and 0
the 0
Church 0
already 0
accepts 0
repentant 0
homosexuals 0
as 0
they 0
are, 0
just 0
as 0
she 0
accepts 0
repentant 0
practitioners 0
of 0
ANY 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
flesh. 1

So 1
why 1
are 1
our 1
bishops 1
playing 1
dumb? 1

Quite 1
obviously, 1
it 1
is 1
because 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
actually 1
closing 1
an 1
episcopal 1
eye 1
to 1
are 1
the 1
folks 1
who 1
want 1
to 1
keep 1
right 1
on 1
sinning--and 1
sinning 1
proudly. 1

This 1
is 1
what 1
the 1
Church 1
of 1
Accompaniment 1
is 1
all 1
about! 1

But, 0
practically 0
speaking--in 0
the 0
real 0
world--this 0
kind 0
of 0
"accompaniment" 0
is 0
only 0
green-lighting 1
vice 1
and 1
mortal 1
sin, 1
and 0
as 0
such 0
constitutes 0
a 1
hideous 1
violation 1
of 1
everything 1
these 1
bishops 1
supposedly 1
believe 1
as 1
Catholic 1
priests. 1

So 0
what's 0
going 0
on 0
here? 0

Who 1
are 1
these 1
bishops 1
that 1
think 1
they 1
can 1
play 1
fast 1
and 1
loose 1
not 1
only 1
with 1
the 1
moral 1
theology 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church, 1
but 1
also 1
with 1
the 1
immortal 1
souls 1
of 1
their 1
flock? 1

Is 1
it 1
any 1
wonder 1
that 1
priests 1
and 1
laity 1
alike 1
are 1
changing 1
their 1
attitude 1
on 1
the 1
"gay 1
lifestyle" 1
and 1
violations 1
of 1
the 1
Sixth 1
Commandment 1
when 1
so 1
many 1
bishops 1
are 1
working 1
to 1
remove 1
the 1
stigma 1
attached 1
to 1
this 1
sin 1
that 1
Scripture 1
tells 1
us 1
cries 1
to 1
heaven 1
for 1
vengeance? 1

The 1
Catholic 1
Church's 1
new-found 1
"climate 1
of 1
tolerance" 1
is 1
exactly 1
what 1
McCarrick 1
and 1
company 1
are 1
counting 1
on! 1

It 1
is 1
truly 1
homophobic 1
for 1
any 1
bishop 1
to 1
lie 1
to 1
the 1
gay 1
community 1
about 1
this, 1
and 1
to 1
risk 1
the 1
immortal 1
souls 1
of 1
the 1
sheep 1
merely 1
so 1
that 1
the 1
shepherd 1
might 1
pride 1
himself 1
on 1
occupying 1
the 1
politically 1
correct 1
high 1
ground. 1

This 1
is 1
gross 1
dereliction 1
of 1
duty, 1
and 1
we 1
hope 1
and 1
pray 1
that 1
all 1
the 1
good 1
U.S. 1
bishops 1
would 1
jump 1
at 1
the 1
opportunity 1
to 1
issue 1
statements 1
reaffirming 1
the 1
Church's 1
clear 1
teaching 1
against 1
all 1
sins 1
of 1
the 1
flesh, 1
homo- 1
and 1
heterosexual. 1

Again, 0
God 0
bless 0
Archbishop 0
Hebda 0
for 0
this 0
welcome 0
statement, 0
and 0
may 0
God 0
grant 0
him 0
the 0
courage 0
now 0
to 0
finish 0
the 0
task 0
by 0
publicly 0
reassuring 0
the 1
scandalized 1
faithful 1
that 0
it’s 0
not 0
just 0
abuse 0
of 0
minors 0
or 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
that’s 0
going 0
on 0
here. 0

Our 1
bishops 1
must 1
make 1
it 1
absolutely 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
Church's 1
moral 1
theology 1
on 1
homosexuality 1
will 1
not 1
and 1
can 1
not 1
be 1
trumped 1
by 1
the 1
dictates 1
of 1
political 1
correctness. 1

And 0
neither 0
can 0
God's 0
law 0
be 0
changed 0
to 0
accommodate 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
our 0
“most 0
enlightened” 0
age---which 0
is, 0
of 0
course, 0
an 1
evil 1
spirit 1
that 1
can 1
be 1
driven 1
out 1
only 1
by 1
prayer 1
and 1
fasting. 1

Until 1
the 1
Church 1
and 1
her 1
bishops 1
get 1
back 1
to 1
reaffirming 1
traditional 1
Catholic 1
teaching 1
on 1
human 1
sexuality 1
we 1
can 1
forget 1
about 1
seeing 1
an 1
end 1
to 1
the 1
sexual 1
abuse 1
crisis 1
and 1
the 1
massive 1
problem 1
of 1
homosexuality 1
in 1
the 1
clergy. 1

McCarrick 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
norm, 0
not 0
the 0
exception, 0
and 0
confidence 0
in 0
the 0
leadership 0
and 0
moral 0
authority 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
will 1
remain 1
in 1
the 1
toilet 1
indefinitely... 1
exactly 0
as 0
the 1
forces 1
of 1
darkness 1
intended 0
all 0
along. 0

The 0
island’s 0
electrical 0
grid 0
was 0
all 0
but 0
completely 0
destroyed 0
during 0
Hurricane 0
Maria, 0
and 0
many 0
are 0
still 0
struggling 0
without 0
the 0
most 0
basic 0
of 0
necessities. 0

This 0
news 0
comes 0
just 0
one 0
day 0
after 0
Puerto 0
Rico’s 0
Governor 0
Ricardo 0
Rossello 0
asked 0
the 0
federal 0
government 0
for 0
an 0
additional 0
$4.6 0
billion 0
in 0
funding 0
beyond 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
request 0
last 0
week 0
for 0
$29 0
billion 0
from 0
Congress 0
for 0
relief 0
efforts. 0

“Puerto 0
Rico 0
has 0
experienced 0
a 1
natural 1
disaster 1
of 1
a 1
magnitude 1
not 1
seen 1
in 1
over 1
a 1
century, 1
and 0
we 1
are 1
doing 1
everything 1
possible 1
to 1
address 1
the 1
needs 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
citizens 1
of 1
Puerto 1
Rico 1
during 1
this 1
time 1
of 1
crisis,” 1
Rosselló 0
wrote. 0

“However, 0
the 1
unprecedented 1
level 1
of 1
destruction, 1
coupled 0
with 0
the 0
almost 0
complete 0
shut-down 0
of 0
business 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
have 0
made 0
it 0
impossible 0
for 0
us 0
to 0
meet 0
the 0
considerable 0
human 0
needs 0
without 0
the 0
measures 0
proposed 0
above,” 0
he 0
added. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
also 0
announced 0
Monday 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
allow 0
a 0
10-day 0
waiver 0
temporarily 0
blocking 0
the 0
Jones 0
Act 0
to 0
expire. 0

This 0
is 0
devastating 0
news 0
for 0
those 0
living 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico, 0
as 0
foreign 0
ships 0
can 0
no 0
longer 0
bring 0
aid 0
to 0
the 1
hurricane-ravaged 1
island 1
from 0
U.S. 0
ports. 0

Officials 0
still 0
expect 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
six 0
more 0
months 0
before 0
electricity 0
can 0
be 0
fully 0
restored 0
to 0
Puerto 0
Rico. 0

As 1
the 1
days 1
have 1
become 1
weeks, 1
the 1
weeks 1
will 1
become 1
months, 1
and 1
survival 1
will 1
get 1
more 1
difficult. 1

Many 0
are 0
now 0
fleeing 0
to 0
the 0
mainland 0
United 0
States 0
just 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
can 0
survive. 0

The 0
economy 0
in 0
Puerto 0
Rico 0
is 0
at 0
a 0
standstill, 0
and 0
without 0
clean 0
drinking 0
water, 0
many 0
are 0
finding 0
life 0
too 0
difficult 0
should 0
they 0
remain 0
on 0
the 0
island 0
and 0
isolated. 0

Jeanine 0
Pirro 0
spoke 0
to 0
Hannity 0
on 0
Thursday 0
night 0
and 0
asked, 0
"Since 0
when 0
does 0
truth 0
and 0
justice 0
or 0
guilt 0
and 0
innocence 0
depend 0
on 0
your 0
political 0
party. 0

I 1
fear 1
for 1
this 1
nation 1
when 1
this 1
is 1
now 1
the 1
standard. 1

You 1
believe 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
goes 1
against 1
a 1
Republican 1
and 1
you 1
don't 1
believe 1
any 1
woman 1
who 1
goes 1
against 1
a 1
Democrat." 1

She 0
continued. 0

"I 0
worry 1
about 1
this 1
country. 1

I 0
don't 0
want 0
these 0
people 0
to 0
sit 0
on 0
juries. 0

It's 0
no 0
longer 0
about 0
truth 0
and 0
justice. 0

It's 0
about 0
politics." 0

Hannity 0
asks, 0
"Why 0
are 0
people 0
willing 0
to 0
throw 0
out 0
due 0
process, 0
equal 0
justice 0
under 0
the 0
law 0
and 0
the 0
presumption 0
of 0
innocence?" 0

Gregg 0
Jarrett 0
says 0
it's 0
"because 0
they're 1
zealous 1
to 0
the 0
point 0
where 0
they've 0
lost 0
their 0
common 0
sense." 0

Their 0
commentary 0
on 0
the 0
video 0
below 0
is 0
interesting. 0

Sen. 0
Charles 0
Grassley 0
(R-IA) 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
commended 0
on 0
his 0
handling 0
of 0
the 0
situation. 0

In 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
compromise, 0
he 0
called 0
off 0
the 0
Senate 0
committee 0
vote 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
on 0
the 0
calendar 0
for 0
Thursday 0
and 0
scheduled 0
a 0
hearing 0
for 0
next 0
Monday 0
so 0
that 0
both 0
Christine 0
Ford 0
and 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
could 0
state 0
their 0
cases. 0

Kavanaugh 0
immediately 0
responded 0
to 0
Grassley. 0

For 0
36 0
hours, 0
there 0
was 0
silence 0
from 0
the 0
Ford 0
camp. 0

Then, 0
their 0
demands 0
began. 0

First, 0
it 0
was 0
reported 0
that 0
Ford 0
would 0
answer 0
questions, 0
but 0
only 0
at 0
a 0
closed 0
hearing 0
and 0
only 0
after 0
an 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
had 0
been 0
completed. 0

Republicans 0
felt 0
that 0
the 0
request 0
for 0
a 0
closed 0
hearing 0
was 0
reasonable, 0
but 0
the 0
demand 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
FBI 0
investigation 0
was 0
not. 0

The 0
FBI 0
investigates 0
federal 0
crimes 0
and/or 0
national 0
security 0
issues. 0

When 0
the 0
FBI 0
received 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein’s 0
letter 0
last 0
week, 0
they 0
forwarded 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
place 0
in 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
background 0
check 0
file. 0

(Note: 0
The 0
FBI 0
has 0
already 0
conducted 0
six 0
background 0
checks 0
on 0
Kavanaugh, 0
the 0
most 0
recent 0
one 0
was 0
done 0
this 0
summer.) 0

It 0
was 0
announced 0
later 0
that 0
Sen. 0
Grassley 0
would 0
not 0
change 0
the 0
date 0
of 0
the 0
hearing 0
set 0
for 0
Monday. 0

Even 0
Senators 0
Jeff 0
Flake, 0
Bob 0
Corker 0
and 0
Lindsey 0
Graham, 0
who 0
have 0
all 0
said 0
Ford 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
heard, 0
have 0
indicated 0
that 0
if 0
she 0
does 0
not 0
show 0
up 0
for 0
Monday's 0
hearing, 0
they 0
will 0
schedule 0
a 0
vote 0
on 0
Kavanaugh's 0
confirmation. 0

On 0
Thursday 0
afternoon, 0
Ford's 0
highly 1
partisan, 1
activist 1
attorney 1
emailed 0
Grassley 0
saying, 0
although 0
her 0
client 0
strongly 0
prefers 0
that 0
an 0
investigation 0
take 0
place 0
beforehand, 0
Ford 0
will 0
testify 0
next 0
week, 0
but 0
she 0
cannot 0
do 0
so 0
on 0
Monday. 0

And 0
she 0
will 0
only 0
be 0
questioned 0
by 0
members 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
the 0

that 0

no 0

come 0
anyway, 0
the 0
Republicans 0
on 0
the 0

committee 0
have 0
tried 0
very 0
hard 0
to 0
oblige 0
Ford's 0
requests, 0
even 0
offering 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
California 0
to 0
hear 0
her 0
testimony. 0

She 0
and 0
her 0

feel 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
driver's 0
seat 0
and 0
thus, 0
can 0
call 0
all 0
the 0
shots. 0

Democrats 1
want 1
to 1
delay 1
this 1
vote 1
until 1
after 1
the 1
midterms 1
because 1
they 1
believe 1
they 1
have 1
a 1
chance 1
to 1
retake 1
the 1
Senate 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
House. 1

Rush 0
Limbaugh 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Senate 0
has 0
bent 1
over 1
backwards 1
to 0
accommodate 0
the 0
accuser. 0

"I 0
don’t 1
care 1
who 1
you 1
are, 1
determine 0
the 0
scope 0
and 0
the 0
parameters 0
of 0
an 0
investigation. 0

The 0
accuser 0
doesn’t 0
get 0
to 0
determine 0
when 0
and 0
who 0
investigates. 0

In 1
no 1
circumstance 1
in 1
the 1
country 1
does 1
that 1
happen." 1

In 0
addition 0
to 0
the 0
political 0
reasons 0
for 0
the 0
delay 0
requests, 0
it 0
appears 0
as 0
if 0
this 0
woman 0
is 0
reluctant 0
to 0
testify 0
under 0
oath, 0
possibly 0
because 0
she 0
doesn’t 0
want 0
to 0
perjure 0
herself. 0

Maybe 0
she 0
realizes 0
the 0
magnitude 0
of 0
what 0
her 0
accusations 0
have 0
unleashed. 0

Either 0
this 0
did 0
not 0
happen 0
at 0
all 0
or 0
a 0
much 0
milder 0
version 0
of 0
the 0
situation 0
she 0
alleges 0
occurred. 0

Kavanaugh 0
may 0
have 0
made 0
a 0
pass 0
at 0
her 0
as 0
17-year-old 0
boys 0
(and 0
even 0
some 0
17-year-old 0
girls) 0
are 0
known 0
to 0
do. 0

Ford 0
said 0
no 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
it. 0

Even 0
she 0
admits, 0
they 0
did 0
not 0
have 0
sex, 0
nor 0
was 0
this 0
a 0
hostage 0
situation. 0

The 0
perception 0
of 0
events 0
by 0
a 0
15-year-old 0
girl 0
may 0
differ 0
significantly 0
from 0
reality. 0

And 0
36 0
years 0
can 0
distort 0
memories, 0
one 0
way 0
or 0
another. 0

What 1
is 1
happening 1
in 1
the 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh 1
nomination 1
process 1
should 1
concern 1
every 1
American. 1

Whatever 0
happened 0
or 0
did 0
not 0
happen, 0
it's 0
difficult 0
to 0
feel 0
sorry 0
for 0
someone 0
who 0
comes 0
forward 0
at 0
such 0
a 0
politically 0
opportune 0
moment. 0

There 0

ample 0
time 0
to 0

this 0
in 0

the 1
moment 1
it 1
could 1
inflict 1
maximum 1

damage. 1

Democrats 0

overestimating 0

told 0

“I 0
don’t 0
regard 0

an 0
aberration 0

anything, 0
I 1
regard 1
him 1

was 0

have 0
a 0

Like 0
this. 0

Farrakhan 1
had 1
praised 1
Hitler 1
and 1
declared 1
that 1
the 1
Jews, 1
"can't 1
say 1
'Never 1
Again' 1
to 1
God, 1
because 1
when 1
he 1
puts 1
you 1
in 1
the 1
ovens, 1
you're 1
there 1
forever.” 1

"Here 1
come 1
the 1
Jews. 1

They 1
don't 1
like 1
Farrakhan, 1
so 1
they 1
call 1
me 1
Hitler. 1

Well, 1
that's 1
a 1
good 1
name. 1

Hitler 1
was 1
a 1
very 1
great 1

Would 1
a 1

get 1
a 1

said 0
at 0
the 0
conclusion 0
of 0
the 0
landmark 0
summit. 0

"People 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
be 1
very 1
impressed. 1

People 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
happy." 0

The 0
document 0
he 0
and 0
Kim 0
signed 0
said 0
the 0
North 0
Korean 0
leader 0
"reaffirmed 0
his 0
firm 0
and 0
unwavering 1
commitment 0
to 0
complete 0
denuclearization 0
of 0
the 0
Korean 0
Peninsula." 0

In 0
exchange, 0
Trump 0
agreed 0
to 0
"provide 0
security 0
guarantees" 0
to 0
North 0
Korea. 0

But 0
there 0
was 0
no 0
mentioning 0
the 0
previous 0
US 0
aim 0
of 0
"complete, 0
verifiable 0
and 0
irreversible 0
denuclearization." 0

And 0
Kim's 0
commitments 0
did 0
not 0
appear 0
to 0
go 0
beyond 0
what 0
he 0
already 0
pledged 0
to 0
do 0
in 0
April 0
when 0
he 0
met 0
South 0
Korean 0
President 0
Moon 0
Jae-in 0
along 0
their 0
countries' 0
border. 0

Trump 0
insisted 0
during 0
a 0
news 0
conference 0
the 0
agreement 0
went 0
further 0
than 0
many 0
people 0
expected. 0

But 0
he 0
acknowledged 0
the 0
effort 0
to 0
rid 0
North 0
Korea 0
of 0
its 0
nuclear 0
arsenal 0
was 0
in 0
its 0
early 0
stages. 0

"We 0
will 0
do 0
it 0
as 0
fast 0
as 0
it 0
can 0
mechanically 0
and 0
physically 0
be 0
done," 0
he 0
said. 0

More 0
critical, 0
in 0
Trump's 0
telling, 0
was 0
the 0
development 0
of 0
a 0
personal 0
bond 0
with 0
Kim, 0
a 0
brutal 1
dictator 1
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
deaths 0
not 0
only 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
citizens 0
but 0
of 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
American, 0
Otto 0
Warmbier, 0
who 0
was 0
returned 0
to 0
the 0
US 0
in 0
a 0
coma 0
only 0
to 0
die 0
days 0
later. 0

"I 0
think 0
our 0
whole 0
relationship 0
with 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
Korean 0
Peninsula 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
very 0
much 0
different 0
situation 0
than 0
it 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past," 0
Trump 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
summit. 0

Later, 0
during 0
his 0
news 0
conference, 0
Trump 0
said 0
Warmbier's 0
death 0
contributed 0
to 0
the 0
summit 0
taking 0
place. 0

"Without 0
Otto, 0
this 0
would 0
not 0
have 0
happened," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

Trump 0
and 0
Kim 0
-- 0
both 0
intent 0
on 0
making 0
history 0
-- 0
greeted 0
each 0
other 0
early 0
in 0
the 0
day 0
with 0
extended 0
hands 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
a 0
row 0
of 0
US 0
and 0
North 0
Korean 0
flags, 0
a 0
previously 0
unthinkable 1
sight 0
that 0
reflects 0
a 0
new 0
chapter 0
in 0
the 0
two 0
countries' 0
acrimonious 1
relationship. 0

Trump's 0
threats 0
to 0
politely 0
walk 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
meeting 0
if 0
his 0
expectations 0
were 0
unmet 0
did 0
not 0
materialize. 0

Instead 0
he 0
predicted 0
he 0
could 0
"solve 0
a 0
big 1
problem, 1
a 0
big 1
dilemma" 1
alongside 0
his 0
new 0
partner. 0

"Working 1
together, 1
we'll 1
get 1
it 1
taken 1
care 1
of," 1
Trump 0
said. 0

The 0
remarks 0
came 0
amid 0
an 0
improbable 0
series 0
of 0
events 0
that 0
few 0
could 0
have 0
anticipated 0
even 0
three 0
months 0
ago. 0

The 0
unlikely 0
images 0
of 0
US 0
and 0
North 0
Korean 0
counterparts 0
engaging 0
in 0
friendly 0
dialogue 0
lent 0
the 0
day 0
an 0
air 0
of 0
unreality. 0

In 0
a 0
detailed 0
menu, 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
the 0
men 0
were 0
served 0
Häagen-Dazs 0
vanilla 0
ice 0
cream 0
for 0
dessert. 0

Other 0
unforeseen 0
events 0
also 0
surrounded 0
the 0
summit, 0
increasing 1
the 1
drama. 1

Minutes 0
before 0
the 0
historic 1
handshake, 0
Trump 0
tweeted 0
that 0
his 0
top 0
economic 0
adviser 0
Larry 0
Kudlow 0
had 0
suffered 0
a 0
heart 0
attack. 0

Immediately 0
after 0
the 0
encounter, 0
Dennis 0
Rodman 0
-- 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
only 0
Americans 0
to 0
have 0
met 0
Kim 0
-- 0
was 0
openly 0
weeping 0
while 0
being 0
interviewed 0
by 0
CNN's 0
Chris 0
Cuomo. 0

Even 0
Kim 0
seemed 0
to 0
acknowledge 0
the 0
surreality 1
of 0
the 0
day. 0

"Many 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
will 0
think 0
of 0
this 0
as 0
a 0
(inaudible) 0
form 0
of 0
fantasy 0
... 0
from 0
a 0
science 0
fiction 0
movie," 0
his 0
translator 0
was 0
overheard 0
saying 0
as 0
the 0
two 0
leaders 0
walked 0
down 0
a 0
white-columned 0
colonnade. 0

At 0
the 0
conclusion 0
of 0
the 0
summit, 0
Trump 0
hailed 1
the 0
talks 0
as 0
a 0
historic, 1
and 0
personal, 0
achievement. 0

"We 0
learned 0
a 0
lot 0
about 0
each 0
other 0
and 0
our 0
countries," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"I 0
learned 0
he's 0
a 0
very 1
talented 1
man." 1

When 0
pressed 0
about 0
those 0
comments 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
Kim's 0
brutal 1
tactics, 0
Trump 0
continued 0
praising 1
the 0
North 0
Korean 0
leaders' 0
ability 0
to 0
run 0
a 0
country 0
at 0
a 0
young 0
age. 0

"He 0
is 0
very 1
talented," 1
Trump 0
said, 0
citing 0
Kim's 0
ability 0
to 0
"take 0
over 0
a 0
situation 0
like 0
he 0
did 0
at 0
26 0
years 0
of 0
age 0
and 0
run 0
it, 0
and 0
run 0
it 0
tough." 0

Kim 0
assumed 0
power 0
after 0
his 0
father 0
Kim 0
Jong 0
Il, 0
also 0
a 0
brutal 1
dictator, 1
died 0
in 0
2011. 0

Throughout 0
the 0
day, 0
Trump 0
and 0
Kim's 0
body 0
language 0
was 0
openly 0
friendly, 0
a 0
striking 1
warmth 0
given 0
Kim's 0
iron 0
grip 0
on 0
power 0
and 0
dismal 0
record 0
on 0
human 0
rights. 0

Trump's 0
move 0
to 0
meet 0
him 0
attracted 0
fierce 1
criticism 1
for 0
normalizing 0
a 0
regime 0
routinely 0
called 0
out 0
for 0
its 0
human 0
rights 0
abuses, 0
that 0
over 0
years 0
has 0
built 0
an 0
image 0
of 0
fearsome 1
renegade 1
regime, 0
throwing 0
around 0
threats 0
of 0
nuclear 0
war. 0

The 0
day 0
began 0
with 0
Trump 0
patting 0
Kim 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
and 0
placing 0
his 0
hand 0
on 0
the 0
North 0
Korean's 0
shoulder 0
as 0
they 0
walked 0
into 0
their 0
first 0
meeting. 0

Later 0
they 0
were 0
seen 0
smiling 0
and 0
laughing 0
over 0
lunch. 0

Trump 0
told 0
reporters 0
he 0
would 0
"absolutely" 1
extend 0
an 0
invitation 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
Kim, 0
who 0
also 0
heralded 1
a 1
new 1
era. 1

"Today, 0
we 0
had 0
a 0
historic 1
meeting 0
and 0
decided 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
past 0
behind," 0
Kim 0
said 0
through 0
a 0
translator. 0

"The 1
world 1
will 0
see 0
a 0
major 0
change." 0

The 0
meeting 0
came 0
only 0
months 0
after 0
the 0
two 0
men 0
traded 0
nuclear 0
taunts, 0
ratcheting 0
up 0
tensions 0
and 0
leading 0
to 0
fears 0
of 0
war. 0

By 0
contrast, 0
Trump 0
appeared 0
to 0
back 0
off 0
a 0
military 0
footing 0
on 0
Tuesday, 0
declaring 0
the 0
US 0
will 0
stop 0
the 0
"war 0
games," 0
an 0
apparent 0
reference 0
to 0
joint 0
military 0
exercises 0
with 0
South 0
Korea 0
that 0
North 0
Korea 0
has 0
long 0
rebuked 0
as 0
provocative. 0

Trump 0
also 0
said 0
he 0
hopes 0
to 0
eventually 0
withdraw 0
US 0
forces 0
from 0
South 0
Korea, 0
but 0
said 0
"that's 0
not 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
equation 0
right 0
now." 0

"I 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
our 1
soldiers 1
out. 0

I 0
want 0
to 0
bring 0
our 1
soldiers 1
back 0
home," 0
Trump 0
said. 0

"But 0
that's 0
not 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
equation 0
right 0
now. 0

I 0
hope 0
it 0
will 0
be 0
eventually." 0

Tuesday's 0
meeting, 0
convened 0
at 0
a 0
luxury 0
hotel 0
on 0
the 0
island 0
of 0
Sentosa, 0
came 0
just 0
three 0
months 0
after 0
Trump 0
accepted 0
North 0
Korea's 0
invitation 0
for 0
talks 0
on 0
the 0
spot. 0

It 0
was 0
an 0
extraordinarily 0
compressed 0
timeline 0
for 0
the 0
landmark 0
summit, 0
which 0
at 0
one 0
point 0
was 0
called 0
off 0
entirely 0
as 0
communication 0
broke 0
down 0
between 0
Washington 0
and 0
Pyongyang. 0

The 0
talks 0
were 0
quickly 0
revived, 0
leading 0
to 0
the 0
highly 0
choreographed 0
event 0
that 0
unfolded 0
Tuesday. 0

After 0
the 0
men 0
shook 0
hands, 0
they 0
repaired 0
inside 0
for 0
one-on-one 0
talks. 0

In 0
that 0
first 0
meeting 0
they 0
were 0
joined 0
only 0
by 0
translators, 0
a 0
break 0
from 0
standard 0
practice 0
of 0
having 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
aide 0
present 0
for 0
high-stakes 0
huddles. 0

Later 0
in 0
the 0
day, 0
advisers 0
joined 0
the 0
talks 0
for 0
a 0
larger 0
bilateral 0
session 0
and 0
a 0
working 0
lunch. 0

Trump 0
took 0
keen 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
pageantry 0
of 0
the 0
day, 0
insisting 0
the 0
pictures 0
beamed 0
around 0
the 0
world 0
reflect 0
a 0
commanding 1
leader 1
making 0
a 0
decisive, 0
world-altering 1
move. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
he'd 0
admitted 0
he 0
didn't 0
believe 0
he 0
required 0
extensive 0
preparation 0
to 0
take 0
stock 0
of 0
Kim. 0

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
advance 0
work, 0
Trump 0
commissioned 0
a 0
highly 0
produced 0
video 0
meant 0
to 0
convince 0
Kim 0
to 0
relinquish 0
his 0
weapons 0
and 0
open 0
his 0
country 0
to 0
outside 0
investment. 0

Trump 0
showed 0
Kim 0
the 0
movie 0
on 0
an 0
iPad 0
during 0
their 0
talks. 0

Here 0
in 0
futuristic 1
Singapore, 0
however, 0
Kim 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
view 0
the 0
benefits 0
of 0
economic 0
advancement 0
at 0
close 0
range. 0

He 0
was 0
spotted 0
taking 0
a 0
moonlit 0
stroll 0
around 0
the 0
high-end 0
Marina 0
Bay 0
Sands 0
hotel 0
and 0
casino, 0
owned 0
by 0
GOP 0
mega-donor 0
Sheldon 0
Adelson, 0
the 0
type 0
of 0
glitzy 0
development 0
few 0
North 0
Koreans 0
could 0
ever 0
imagine 0
coming 0
to 0
their 0
country. 0

Kim 0
was 0
cheered 0
by 0
onlookers 0
who 0
caught 0
sight 0
of 0
the 0
dictator, 1
who 0
until 0
earlier 0
this 0
spring 0
was 0
not 0
believed 0
to 0

ever 0
left 0

and 0
on 0

Orban's 0
words 0
are 0
reminiscent 0
of 0
those 0
of 0
US 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
who 0
spoke 0
about 0
putting 0
"America 1
First." 1

"The 0
presidency 0
of 0
Fidesz 0
has 0
discussed 0
yesterday 0
the 0
announcement 0
of 0
the 0
Belgian 0
Prime 0
Minister, 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
– 0
if 0
necessary 0
with 0
force 0
– 0
obligate 0
Central 0
European 0
countries, 0
including 0
Hungary, 0
to 0
accept 0
migrants,” 0
Orban 0
stated. 0

“According 0
to 0
their 0
plan, 0
this 0
will 0
happen 0
in 0
June 0
at 0
the 0
summit 0
of 0
the 0

in 0
Brussels," 0

“Our 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Hungarian 0
Government's 0
website, 0
posted 0
about 0
the 0
ultimatum 0
that 0
was 0
given 0
over 0
the 0
weekend. 0

Over 0
the 0
weekend, 0
Belgian 0
prime 0
minister 0
Charles 0
Michel 0
spoke 0
about 0
sending 0
“an 0
ultimatum” 0
to 0
the 0
Visegrád 0
countries 0
which 0
“reject 0
solidarity”. 0

The 0
essence 0
of 0
this 0
ultimatum 0
would 0
be 0
that 0
if 0
by 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
June 0
a 0
consensus 0
is 0
not 0
reached 0
in 0
the 0

of 0
EU 0

then 0
the 0
planned 0
reforms 0
would 0
be 0
adopted 0
with 0
a 0
qualified 0
majority 0
vote 0
which 0
would 0
overrule 0
dissenters. 0

Minister 0
of 0
Foreign 0
Affairs 0
and 0
Trade 0
Péter 0
Szijjártó 0
said 0
on 0
Tuesday,“Hungary 0
will 1
not 1

an 1

it 1
has 1
never 1
admitted 1

never 1

He 0
also 0
referred 0
to 0
Michel's 0
ultimatum 0
as 0
unacceptable 1
and 1
shocking. 1

“Hungary 1

Szijjártó 0
said. 0

“The 0
Belgian 0
Prime 0

also 0
outrageous 1

this 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
that 0

are 0
openly 0
planning 0

the 0
mandatory 0

quota 0
through 0

“We 0

this 0
whole 0
thing 0
as 0
unacceptable 0
and 0
we 0
reject 0
it," 0
he 0
added. 0

“The 0
countries 0
of 0
the 0
Visegrád 0
Group 0
do 0
not 0
support 0
the 0
introduction 0
of 0
any 0
kind 0
of 0
mandatory 0
quota.” 0

“Perhaps 0
it 0
doesn’t 0
bother 0
the 0
Belgian 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
no-go 0
zones 0
in 0
many 0
Western 0
European 0
cities, 0
or 0
that 0
people 1
with 1
immigrant 1
backgrounds 1
have 1
committed 1
27 1
major 1
terrorist 1
attacks 1
in 1
Europe 1
recently, 0
but 0
this 0
bothers 0
the 0
V4 0
because 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
live 0
on 0
a 0
continent 0
were 0
the 1
threat 1
of 1
terrorism 1
becomes 1
an 1
everyday 1
regularity," 1
he 0
continued. 0

Just 0
this 0
week, 0
we 0
reported 0
that 0
Hungary 0
had 0
grown 0
weary 0
of 0
the 0
talks 0
of 0
pushing 0
illegal 0
Muslim 0
migrants 0
on 0
their 0
country 0
and 0
Europe, 0
and 0
was 0
preparing 0
to 0
walk 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
negotiating 0
table. 0

Orban 0
has 0
taken 0
a 0
tough 0
stance 0
in 0
Hungary. 0

He 0
has 0
ordered 1
all 1
illegal 1
Muslim 1
invaders 1
to 1
get 1
out 1
of 1
Hungary 1
and 1
never 1
come 1
back. 1

In 0
December, 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
concerned 0
with 0
what 0
Brussels 0
wanted, 0
but 0
was 0
determined 0
to 0
defend 0
Hungary's 0
borders. 0

PM 0
Orban 0
has 0
done 0
just 0
that, 0
too. 0

Orban's 0
border 0
wall 0
virtually 0
eliminated 0
illegal 0
immigration. 0

Orban 0
is 0
openly 1
Christian 1
and 0
seems 0
to 0
understand 0
something 0
that 0
many 0
do 0
not 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
allow 0
a 0
wholesale 0
flood 1
of 1
antichrists 1
to 0
pour 0
into 0
your 0
country. 0

Were 1
the 1
Ammonites 1
and 1
Moabites 1
not 1
kept 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
assembly 1
of 1
Israel 1
because 1
of 1
their 1
hatred 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
of 1
God? 1

(Deuteronoy 1
23:3-6) 1
Yes, 0
they 0
were. 0

While 0
Muslims 0
need 0
the 0
Gospel 0
for 0
sure, 0
one 1
cannot 1
allow 1
such 1
an 1
influx 1
into 1
the 1
country, 1
or 1
all 1
you 1
are 1
asking 1
for 1
is 1
the 1
judgments 1
God 1
warned 1
about 1
in 1
Deuteronomy 1
28. 1

I 0
say, 0
well 1
done 1
Mr. 0
Orban. 0

I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
hear 0
more 0
of 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
talk 0
from 0
America's 0
representatives. 0

Newt 0
Gingrich: 0
The 0
truth 0
about 0
Trump, 0
Putin, 0
and 0
Obama 0

President 0
Trump’s 0
summit 0
Monday 0
with 0
Russian 0
President 0
Vladimir 0
Putin 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
created 0
a 0
firestorm 1
of 0
controversy. 0

President 0
Trump 0
seemed 0
to 0
be 0
publicly 0
siding 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 1
dictator 1
against 0
the 0
American 0
intelligence 0
agencies. 0

The 0
initial 0
appearance 0
was 0
so 0
bad 1
that 0
I 0
tweeted: 0
“President 0
Trump 0
must 0
clarify 0
his 0
statements 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
on 0
our 0
intelligence 0
system 0
and 0
Putin. 0

It 0
is 0
the 1
most 1
serious 1
mistake 0
of 0
his 0
presidency 0
and 0
must 0
be 0
corrected 0
– 0
immediately.” 0

After 0
flying 0
home 0
from 0
Helsinki 0
and 0
reviewing 0
the 0
tape 0
and 0
transcript 0
of 0
his 0
press 0
conference 0
with 0
Putin, 0
President 0
Trump 0
said 0
he 0
has 0
“full 0
faith 0
and 0
support 0
for 0
America’s 1
great 1
intelligence 1
agencies” 1
and 0
that 0
he 0
accepts 0
“our 0
intelligence 0
community’s 0
conclusion 0
that 0
Russia’s 0
meddling 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
took 0
place.” 0

In 0
his 0
remarks 0
to 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
were 0
televised 0
by 0
the 0
media, 0
President 0
Trump 0
went 0
on 0
to 0
admit 0
that 0
he 0
realized 0
he 0
needed 0
to 0
clarify 0
his 0
statements 0
in 0
Helsinki. 0

The 0
president 0
said: 0
“It 0
should 0
have 0
been 0
obvious 0
– 0
I 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
obvious 0
– 0
but 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
clarify, 0
just 0
in 0
case 0
it 0
wasn’t. 0

In 0
a 0
key 0
sentence 0
in 0
my 0
remarks, 0
I 0
said 0
the 0
word 0
‘would’ 0
instead 0
of 0
“wouldn’t.” 0
The 0
sentence 0
should 0
have 0
been: 0
I 0
don’t 0
see 0
any 0
reason 0
why 0
I 0
wouldn’t 0
– 0
or 0
why 0
it 0
wouldn’t 0
be 0
Russia. 0

So 0
just 0
to 0
repeat 0
it, 0
I 0
said 0
the 0
word 0
‘would’ 0
instead 0
of 0
‘wouldn’t’ 0
… 0

“I 0
have, 0
on 0
numerous 0
occasions, 0
noted 0
our 0
intelligence 0
findings 0
that 0
Russians 0
attempted 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
our 1
elections. 0

Unlike 0
previous 0
administrations, 0
my 0
administration 0
has 0
and 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
move 0
aggressively 1
to 0
repeal 0
any 0
efforts 0
– 0
and 0
repel 0
– 0
we 0
will 0
stop 0
it, 0
we 0
will 0
repel 0
it 0
– 0
any 0
efforts 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
our 1
elections. 0

We’re 0
doing 0
everything 0
in 0
our 1
power 0
to 0
prevent 0
Russian 0
interference 0
in 0
2018.” 0

Anyone 0
who 0
has 0
studied 0
President 0
Trump 0
knows 0
he 0
hates 0
to 0
admit 0
a 0
mistake. 0

His 0
natural 0
pattern 0
is 0
to 0
move 0
forward 0
and 0
ignore 0
mistakes. 0

For 0
him, 0
this 0
was 0
a 0
big 0
correction 0
(and 0
as 0
I 0
noted 0
the 0
day 0
before, 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
absolutely 0
necessary 0
one). 0

President 1
Trump 1
then 1
reminded 1
everyone 1
of 1
the 1
Obama 1
administration’s 1
failures 1
in 1
dealing 1
with 1
Russian 1
meddling 1
in 1
the 1
election. 1

President 0
Trump 0
noted 0
that 0
President 0
Obama 0
and 0
his 0
advisers 0
had 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
Russians 0
had 0
been 0
working 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
the 0
election 0
and 0
they 0
ignored 0
it, 0
because 1
they 1
thought 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
win. 1

President 0
Trump 0
said: 0
“President 0
Obama, 0
along 0
with 0
(then-CIA 0
Director 0
John) 0
Brennan 0
and 0
(then 0
Director 0
of 0
National 0
Intelligence 0
James) 0
Clapper 0
and 0
the 0
whole 0
group 0
that 0
you 0
see 0
on 0
television 0
now 0
– 0
probably 0
getting 0
paid 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
money 0
by 0
your 0
networks 0
– 0
they 0
knew 0
about 0
Russia’s 0
attempt 0
to 0
interfere 0
in 0
the 0
election 0
in 0
September, 0
and 0
they 0
totally 0
buried 0
it. 0

And 0
as 0
I 0
said, 0
they 0
buried 0
it 0
because 1
they 1
thought 1
that 1
Hillary 1
Clinton 1
was 1
going 1
to 1
win. 1

It 0
turned 0
out 0
it 0
didn’t 0
happen 0
that 0
way. 0

“By 0
contrast, 0
my 0
administration 0
has 0
taken 0
a 0
very 0
firm 0
stance 0
– 0
it’s 1
a 1
very 1
firm 1
stance 1
– 0
on 0
a 0
strong 0
action. 0

We’re 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
strong 1
action 1
to 0
secure 0
our 0
election 0
systems 0
and 0
the 0
process.” 0

There 0
are 0
two 0
key 0
facts 0
in 0
this 0
statement. 0

First, 0
the 0
very 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
loudest 1
in 0
attacking 0
President 0
Trump 0
about 0
his 0
performance 0
at 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
summit 0
are 0
the 0
people 0
who 0
failed 0
to 0
protect 0
America 0
from 0
Russian 0
meddling 0
in 0
2016. 0

The 1
very 1
intensity 0
and 0
nastiness 1
of 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Brennan 0
and 0
former 0
Director 0
of 0
National 0
Intelligence 0
Clapper 0
is 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
distract 0
attention 0
from 0
their 0
failure 0
to 1
protect 1
America. 1

It 0
was 0
their 0
duty 0
in 0
2016 0
– 0
not 0
candidate 0
Trump’s. 0

Second, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
been 0
far 0
tougher 0
on 0
Russia 0
than 0
President 0
Obama 0
ever 0
dreamed 0
of 0
being. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
is 0
taking 0
real 0
actions 0
designed 0
to 0
weaken 0
Russia 0
and 0
force 0
Putin 0
to 0
change 0
his 0
aggressive 1
behavior. 0

The 1
Trump 1
administration 1
has 0
levied 0
tough 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Russia. 0

Also, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
public 0
lecture 0
about 0
Germany 0
not 0
buying 0
natural 0
gas 0
from 0
Russia 0
was 0
aimed 0
at 0
cutting 0
Putin 0
off 0
from 0
hard 0
currency 0
worth 0
tens 0
of 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
and 0
further 0
weakening 0
the 0
Russian 0
economy. 0

Furthermore, 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
efforts 0
to 0
get 0
our 0
European 0
allies 0
to 0
increase 0
their 0
defense 0
spending 0
has 0
a 0
direct 0
impact 0
on 0
Putin. 0

The 1
stronger 1
NATO 1
is, 1
the 1
less 1
maneuvering 1
room 1
Russia 1
has. 1

Beyond 0
pressuring 0
our 1
allies, 0
consider 0
these 0
specific 0
steps 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
taken 0
against 0
Russia: 0

Where 0
President 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
provide 0
serious 0
weapons 0
to 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
help 0
them 0
defend 0
themselves 0
(his 0
response 0
was 0
weakness 1
on 1
a 1
pathetic 1
scale), 1
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
approved 0
the 0
sale 0
of 0
offensive 0
weapons 0
to 0
enable 0
the 0
Ukrainians 0
to 0
increase 0
the 0
cost 0
of 0
Russian 0
aggression. 0

When 0
the 0
Russians 0
used 0
chemical 0
weapons 0
in 0
Great 0
Britain, 0
President 0
Trump 0
joined 0
our 1
allies 0
and 0
expelled 0
60 0
Russian 0
intelligence 0
officers 0
from 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

When 0
the 0
Russians 0
retaliated, 0
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
closed 0
the 0
Russian 0
consulate 0
in 0
Seattle. 0

President 0
Trump 0
had 0
previously 0
shuttered 0
the 0
Russian 0
consulate 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco 0
and 0
smaller 0
annexes 0
in 0
Washington 0
and 0
New 0
York. 0

More 0
than 0
100 0
Russian 0
individuals 0
and 0
companies 0
have 0
been 0
sanctioned 0
for 0
a 0
variety 0
of 0
reasons. 0

Despite 0
the 0
hysteria 0
of 0
the 0
left, 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
to 0
see 0
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
as 0
anything 0
but 0
firm 1
in 0
its 0
dealing 0
with 0
Russia. 0

Nothing 0
done 0
in 0
Helsinki 0
made 0
life 0
easier 0
for 0
the 0
Putin 0
regime 0
in 0
its 0
continued 0
economic 0
decay 0
and 0
diplomatic 0
isolation 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
sanctions 0
regime. 0

Finally, 0
a 0
brief 0
word 0
about 0
the 0
strong 0
language 0
and 0
vicious 1
comments 0
about 0
the 0
president. 0

We 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
early 0
stages 0
of 0
a 0
cultural 0
civil 0
war 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
left 0
sees 0
itself 0
losing. 0

This 0
is 0
what 0
led 0
me 0
to 0
write 0
my 0
new 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
best-selling 0
book, 0
“Trump’s 1
America: 1
The 0
Truth 0
About 0
Our 1
Nation’s 1
Great 1
Comeback.” 1
With 0
each 0
passing 0
month 0
the 0
radical-extremist 0
wing 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party 0
dominates 0
the 0
progressive 0
wing 0
more 0
and 0
more. 0

With 0
President 0
Trump’s 0
nomination 0
of 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court, 0
it 0
was 0
clear 0
that 0
anyone 0
Trump 0
nominated 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
attacked. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
demonstrators 0
protesting 0
the 0
nomination 0
had 0
signs 0
for 0
all 0
four 0
of 0
the 0
finalists 0
and 0
were 0
instantly 0
ready 0
to 0
oppose 0
the 0
president 0
regardless 0
of 0
his 0
choice. 0

Similarly, 0
Obama-era 0
national 0
security 0
officials 0
seem 0
determined 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
harshest 1
possible 1
language 0
to 0
attack 0
President 0
Trump. 0

I 0
think 0
their 0
strong 0
words 0
and 0
hysteria 1
are 0
driven 1
by 1
their 1
own 1
guilt. 1

Whatever 0
the 0
Russians 0
did, 0
they 0
did 0
while 0
Brennan 0
was 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
CIA, 0
Clapper 0
was 0
director 0
of 0
national 0
intelligence, 0
and 0
James 0
Comey 0
was 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Investigation. 0

These 0
former 0
officials 0
attack 0
Trump 0
ferociously 1
to 0
hide 0
their 0
own 0
failure 0
and 0
their 0
own 0
guilt. 0

Just 0
keep 0
that 0
in 0
mind 0
the 0
next 0
time 0
you 0
see 0
one 0
of 0
them 0
on 0
TV. 0

My 0
prediction 0
is 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
will 0
remain 0
tough 0
on 0
Russia, 0
and 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
press 0
conference 0
will 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
the 0
aberration 0
it 0
was. 0

Asteroid 0
Will 0
Skim 0
By 0
Earth 0
Days 0
Before 0
Christmas: 0
It 0
Is 0
‘Potentially 0
Hazardous’ 0

An 0
asteroid 0
called 0
3200 0
Phaethon 0
will 0
skim 0
past 0
the 0
Earth 0
just 0
days 0
before 0
many 0
will 0
celebrate 0
with 0
Christmas 0
festivities. 0

The 0
three-mile-wide 0
asteroid 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
miss 0
the 0
Earth, 0
but 0
it’s 0
still 0
labeled 0
as 0
“potentially 0
hazardous,” 0
and 0
for 0
good 0
reasons. 0

With 0
a 0
diameter 0
of 0
about 0
3 0
miles, 0
the 0
asteroid 0
named 0
3200 0
Phaethon 0
(after 0
the 0
Greek 0
demi-god 0
who, 0
according 0
to 0
legend, 0
nearly 0
set 0
the 0
Earth 0
on 0
fire) 0
is 0
classified 0
as 0
“potentially 1
hazardous” 1
by 0
the 0
Minor 0
Planet 0
Center. 0

The 0
asteroid 0
will 0
pass 0
within 0
6.5 0
million 0
miles 0
of 0
the 0
Earth, 0
which 0
is 0
relatively 0
close 0
in 0
space 0
terms, 0
but 0
still 0
around 0
27 0
times 0
the 0
distance 0
of 0
the 0
moon. 0

Much 0
closer 0
flybys 0
have 0
occurred 0
in 0
the 0
very 0
recent 0
past. 0

Scientists 0
at 0
NASA’s 0
Jet 0
Propulsion 0
Laboratory 0
are 0
planning 0
to 0
use 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
detailed 0
3D 0
model 0
of 0
the 0
asteroid, 0
which 0
has 0
a 0
particularly 0
irregular 0
shape. 0

First 0
detected 0
in 0
December 0
2007, 0
3200 0
Phaethon 0
is 0
widely 0
thought 0
to 0
be 0
the 0

for 0
the 0
Geminid 0
meteor 0
shower, 0
which 0
is 0
due 0
to 0
peak 0
this 0
year 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
December 0
13. 0

This 0
would 0
make 0
the 0
Geminids 0
one 0
of 0
only 0
two 0
major 0
meteor 0
showers 0
not 0
originating 0
from 0
a 0
comet; 0
the 0
other 0
being 0
the 0
Quadrantids 0
in 0
January. 0

The 0
main 0
difference 0
between 0
asteroids 0
and 0
comets 0
is 0
their 0
composition. 0

Asteroids 0
are 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
metals 0
and 0
rocky 0
material, 0
while 0
comets 0
are 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
ice, 0
dust 0
and 0
rocky 0
material. 0

Comets 0
which 0
approach 0
the 0
Sun 0
lose 0
material 0
with 0
each 0
orbit 0
because 0
some 0
of 0
their 0
ice 0
melts 0
and 0
vaporizes 0
to 0
form 0
a 0
tail. 0

But 0
the 0
real 0
question 0
is 0
will 0
anyone 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
asteroid’s 0
close 0
approach 0
to 0
our 0
planet. 0

According 0
to 0
NASA, 0
3200 0
Phaethon 0
will 0
be 0
visible 0
in 0
small 0
telescopes 0
for 0
experienced 0
observers 0
in 0
areas 0
with 0
dark 0
skies. 0

It 0
is 0
potentially 0
detectable 0
for 0
three 0
weeks 0
but 0
will 0
be 0
at 0
its 0
brightest 0
between 0
December 0
11 0
and 0
21. 0

If 0
you 0
don’t 0
see 0
the 0
asteroid 0
itself, 0
be 0
sure 0
to 0
look 0
out 0
for 0
the 0
Geminid 0
meteor 0
shower, 0
which 0
is 0
set 0
to 0
provide 0
a 1
spectacular 1
show 1
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
10 0

Here’s 0
what 0
the 0

up 0
to, 0
when 0
CNN 0
and 0
the 0
rest 0
had 0
their 0
little 0
fever 0
dreams 0
about 0
cross-border 0

If 0

on 0
dragging 0
its 0
feet 0
with 0
the 0
building 0

funding 0
of 0

every 0

they’ve 0

him 0
down 0
and 0
out, 0
he 0
stands 0
back 0
up 0
and 0
keeps 0
on 0
coming. 0

They 0
laughed 0
when 0
he 0
announced 0
his 0
candidacy. 0

They 0
thought 0
he 0
was 0
just 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
a 0

They 1
couldn’t 1
have 1
been 1

He 0
survived 0
the 0

got 0

He 0
knocked 1

He 0

Judge 0
Robert 0

granted 0

Tuesday 0
to 0
take 0

down. 0

The 0
Donald 0

administration 0
last 0

gave 0
permission 0
for 0
Wilson 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
blueprints, 0
but 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
unaware 0
of 0
the 0
decision 0
and 0
was 0
glad 0
it 0
was 0
being 0
reviewed. 0

Eight 0
US 0

and 0
the 0
District 0
of 0

sued, 0
arguing 0
the 0

could 0

anyone 0
-- 0
from 0

a 0
'lone 0

gunman 0
-- 0
to 0
make 0
untraceable, 1

plastic 1
weapons. 1

Wilson 0
complied 0
with 0
the 0

but 0
put 0
out 0
a 0
call 0
for 0
financial 0

for 0
the 0
legal 0
battle 0
ahead, 0
including 0
a 0
scheduled 0
August 0
10 0

hearing. 0

He 0
told 0
CBS 0

ahead 0
of 0
the 0

that 0
he 0
believes 0
"access 0
to 0

It's 0
a 0
fundamental 0
human 0
right." 0

"What 0
I'm 0
doing 0
is 0
legally 0
protected," 0
he 0
said. 0

"I 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
the 0

I 0
will 0
go 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0

I 0
will 0
waste 0
all 0
my 0
time." 0

President 0
'glad' 0
for 0
review 0
- 0

As 0
uproar 0
was 0
building 0
Tuesday 0
over 0
Wilson's 0
efforts, 0
the 0
president 0
tweeted 0
that 0
making 0
plastic 0
3D-printed 0
guns 0
publicly 0
available 0
"doesn't 0
seem 0
to 0
make 0
much 0
sense." 0

White 0
House 0
spokeswoman 0
Sarah 0
Sanders 0
elaborated 0
Wednesday, 0
saying 0
the 0
administration's 0
Justice 0
Department 0
had 0
acted 0
on 0
its 0
own 0
in 0
granting 0
Wilson 0
permission 0
to 0
publish 0
the 0
blueprints 0
on 0
his 0
Defcad 0
website 0
-- 0
settling 0
a 0
five-year 0
legal 0
battle. 0

"The 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
made 0
a 0
deal 0
without 0
the 0
president's 0
approval," 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

"The 0
president's 0
glad 0
this 0
effort 0
was 0
delayed 0
to 0
give 0
more 0
time 0
to 0
review 0
the 0
issue." 0

Sanders 0
also 0
repeated 0
the 0
administration's 0
claim 0
from 0
a 0
day 0
earlier 0
that 0
existing 0
law 0
already 0
prohibits 0
plastic 0
firearms. 0

The 0
National 0
Rifle 0
Association, 0
the 0
nation's 0
most 0
politically 0
influential 0
gun 0
rights 0
group, 0
echoed 0
that 0
claim, 0
contending 0
that 0
the 0
1988 0
law 0
made 0
the 0
current 0
3D-printed 0
gun 0
issue 0
moot. 0

"Regardless 0
of 0
what 0
a 0
person 0
may 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
publish 0
on 0
the 0
Internet, 0
undetectable 0
plastic 0
guns 0
have 0
been 0
illegal 0
for 0
30 0
years," 0
the 0
NRA 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

But 0
Wilson 0
has 0
gotten 0
around 0
the 0
legal 0
prohibition 0
by 0
providing 0
instructions 0
with 0
the 0
digital 0
files 0
for 0
3D 0
printing 0
his 0
"Liberator" 0
plastic 0
gun 0
that 0
call 0
for 0
an 0
approximately 0
six-ounce 0
block 0
of 0
steel 0
to 0
be 0
affixed 0
to 0
the 0
weapon. 0

Should 0
those 0
who 0
print 0
the 0
gun 0
follow 0
those 0
instructions, 0
metal 0
detectors 0
would 0
pick 0
up 0
the 0
weapons, 0
thus 0
complying 0
with 0
the 0
law. 0

But 0
while 0
users 0
can 0
build 0
the 0
gun, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
to 0
ensure 0
they 0
affix 0
metal 0
to 0
it. 0

'The 0

Late 0
Tuesday, 0
dozens 0
of 0
Democratic 0
senators 0
introduced 0
legislation 0
to 0
prohibit 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
3D-printable 0

a 0
move 0
gun 0
control 0
groups 0
applauded. 0

But 0
some 0
damage 0
was 0
already 0
done. 0

Wilson's 0
blueprints 0
had 0
been 0
posted 0
on 0
Defcad 0
before 0
the 0
court 0
order 0
took 0
effect 0
and 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
downloaded 0
thousands 0
of 0
times. 0

"The 0

over. 0

The 0

are 0
downloadable. 0

The 0
files 0
are 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
domain 0
-- 0
you 0
cannot 0
take 0
them 0
back," 0
Wilson 0
told 0
CBS. 0

Gun 0
control 0
groups 0
nevertheless 0
were 0
relieved 0
by 0
the 0
judge's 0
decision, 0
with 0
the 0
Brady 0
Campaign 0
to 0
Prevent 0
Gun 0
Violence 0
calling 0
3D-printed 0
firearms 0
"nothing 1
short 1
of 1
a 1
menace 1
to 0
society." 0

"There 0
is 0
simply 0
no 0
way 0
of 0
telling 0
how 0
much 0
damage 0
has 0
already 0
been 0
done 0
by 0
Cody 0
Wilson's 0
dangerous 1
and 1
reckless 1
actions," 0
Brady 0
Campaign 0
co-president 0
Kris 0
Brown 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

"This 0
is 0
a 0
strong 0
step 0
and 0
a 0
clear 0
victory 0
for 0
the 0
entire 0
gun 0
safety 0
movement, 0
but 0
we 0
simply 0
can't 0
let 0
up." 0

Prior 0
to 0
last 0
month, 0
Wilson 0
had 0
actually 0
been 0
losing 0
his 0
drawn-out 0
legal 0
battle, 0
after 0
both 0
a 0
federal 0
district 0
court 0
and 0
an 0
appellate 0
court 0
ruled 0
against 0
him. 0

The 0
US 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
declined 0
to 0
take 0
up 0
his 0
case. 0

But 0
in 0
a 0
sign 0
of 0
his 0
determination 0
to 0
continue 0
the 0
legal 0
fight, 0
a 0
message 0
on 0
the 0
Defense 0
Distributed 0
website 0
made 0
a 0
public 0
appeal 0
for 0
financial 0
support 0
"to 0
uncensor 0
the 0
site." 0

Homeschooling 0
Protects 0
Children 0
from 0
Violence 1
and 0
Marxism 0

The 0
February 0
mass 1
shooting 1
at 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
in 0
Parkland, 0
Florida 0
prompted 0
many 0
parents 0
to 0
consider 0
homeschooling. 1

This 0
is 0
hardly 0
surprising, 0
as 0
the 1
misnamed 1
federal 1
“Gun-Free 1
Schools” 1
law 1
leaves 0
schoolchildren 0
defenseless 1
against 0
mass 0
shooters. 0

Removing 0
one’s 0
children 0
from 0
government 0
schools 0
seems 0
a 0
rational 0
response 0
to 0
school 0
shootings. 1

School 0
shootings 1
are 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
form 0
of 0
violence 1
causing 0
more 0
parents 0
to 0
consider 0
homeschooling. 1

Many 0
potential 0
homeschooling 1
parents 0
are 0
concerned 0
about 0
the 0
failure 0
of 0
school 0
administrators 0
to 0
effectively 0
protect 1
children 0
from 0
bullying 0
by 0
other 0
students. 0

Of 0
course, 0
many 0
parents 0
choose 0
homeschooling 1
as 0
a 0
means 0
of 0
protecting 1
their 0
children 0
from 0
federal 0
education 0
“reforms” 0
such 0
as 0
Common 0

Other 0

a 0
desire 0
to 0
protect 1

The 0
spread 0
of 0
cultural 0
Marxism 0
has 0
contributed 0
to 0
the 0
dumbing 1
down 1
of 0
public 0
education. 0

Too 0
many 0
government 0
schools 0
are 0
more 0
concerned 0
with 0
promoting 0
political 0
correctness 0
than 0
ensuring 0
that 0
students 0
receive 0
a 0
good 0
education. 0

Even 0
if 0
cultural 0
Marxism 0
did 0
not 0
dumb 1
down 1
education, 0
concerns 0
that 0
government 0
schools 0
are 0
indoctrinating 0
children 0
with 0
beliefs 0
that 0
conflict 0
with 0
parents’ 0
political, 0
social, 0
and 0
even 0
religious 0
beliefs 0
would 0
motivate 0
many 0
families 0
to 0
homeschool. 1

Even 0
when 0
government 0
schools 0
are 0
not 0
intentionally 0
promoting 0
cultural 0
Marxism 0
or 0
other 0
left-wing 0
ideologies, 0
they 0
are 0
still 0
implicitly 0
biased 0
toward 0
big 0

For 0
example, 0
how 0
many 0
government 0
schools 0
teach 0
the 0
Austrian 0
economics 0
explanation 0
for 0
the 0
Great 0

— 0
much 0
less 0
question 0

— 0
or 0
critically 0

the 0

Parents 0
interested 0
in 0
providing 0
their 0
children 0
with 0
a 0
quality 0
education 0
emphasizing 0
the 0
ideas 0
of 0
liberty 0
should 0
consider 0
looking 0
into 0
my 0
homeschooling 1
curriculum. 0

The 0
Ron 0
Paul 0
Curriculum 0
provides 0
students 0
with 0
a 0
well-rounded 1
education 1
that 0
includes 0
rigorous 0
programs 0
in 0
history, 0
mathematics, 0
and 0
the 0
physical 0
and 0
natural 0
sciences. 0

The 0
curriculum 0
also 0
provides 0
instruction 0
in 0
personal 0
finance. 0

Students 0
can 0
develop 0
superior 0
oral 0
and 0
verbal 0
communication 0
skills 0
via 0
intensive 0
writing 0
and 0
public 0
speaking 0
courses. 0

Another 0
feature 0
of 0
my 1
curriculum 1
is 0
that 0
it 0
provides 0
students 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
create 0
and 0
run 0
their 0
own 0
internet 0
businesses. 0

The 0
government 0
and 0
history 0
sections 0
of 0
the 0
curriculum 0
emphasize 0
Austrian 0
economics, 0
libertarian 0
political 0
theory, 0
and 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
liberty. 0

However, 0
unlike 0
government 0
schools, 0
my 1
curriculum 1
never 0
puts 0
ideological 0
indoctrination 1
ahead 0
of 0
education. 0

While 0
government 0
schools 0
— 0
and 0
even 0
many 0
private 0
schools 0
— 0
pretend 0
religion 0
played 0
no 0
significant 0
role 0
in 0
history, 0
my 1
curriculum 1
addresses 0
the 0
crucial 1
role 0
religion 0
played 0
in 0
the 0
development 0
of 0
Western 0
civilization. 0

However, 0
the 0
materials 0
are 0
drafted 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
any 0
Christian, 0
Jewish, 0
Muslim, 0
or 0
atheist 0
parent 0
can 0
feel 0
comfortable 0
using 0
the 0
curriculum. 0

Interactive 0
forums 0
allow 0
students 0
to 0
engage 0
with 0
and 0
learn 0
from 0
each 0
other. 0

The 0
forums 0
ensure 0
students 0
are 0
actively 0
engaged 0
in 0
their 0
education 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
give 0
them 0
an 0
opportunity 0
to 0
interact 0
with 0
their 0
peers 0
outside 0
of 0
a 0
formal 0
setting. 0

Concern 0
about 0
the 0
safety 0
of 0
students 0
in 0
government-run 0
schools 0
is 0
one 0
reason 0
many 0
parents 0
are 0
considering 0
homeschooling, 1
but 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
only 0
reason. 0

Many 0
parents 0
are 0
motivated 0
by 0
a 0
desire 0
to 0
give 0
their 0
children 0
something 0
better 0
than 0
a 0
curriculum 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
dumbed 1
down 1
by 0
federal 0
initiatives 0
like 0
Common 0
Core. 0

Other 0
parents 0
do 0
not 0
wish 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
children 0
indoctrinated 1
with 0
views 0
that 0
contradict 0
the 0
parents’ 0
political, 0
social, 0
or 0
even 0
religious 0
beliefs. 0

I 0
encourage 0
all 0
parents 0
looking 0
at 0
alternatives 0
to 0
government 0
schools 0
—alternatives 0
that 0
provide 0

The 0
attack 0
took 0
place 0
in 0
a 0
Whataburger 0
restaurant, 0
and 0
the 0
corporation 0
was 0
quick 0
to 0
condemn 0
the 0
man’s 0
actions: 0

“We 0
were 0
shocked 0
to 0
see 0
this 0
video 0
and 0
certainly 0
don’t 0
condone 0
this 0
type 0
of 0
customer 0
behavior 0
in 0
our 0
restaurants. 0

To 0
be 0
clear, 0
no 0
Whataburger 0
employees 0
were 0
involved 0
or 0
witnessed 0
the 0
incident, 0
and 0
we 0
ask 0
that 0
questions 0
be 0
directed 0
to 0
San 0
Antonio 0
PD 0
as 0
we 0
continue 0
supporting 0
their 0
efforts.” 0

Jimenez, 0
who 0
is 0
30, 0
seems 0
to 0
have 0
only 0
had 0
a 0
part-time 0
job. 0

His 0
employer 0
was 0
a 0
San 0
Antonio 0
nightspot 0
called 0
Rumble. 0

Immediately 0
upon 0
learning 0
of 0
the 0
altercation, 1
the 0
bar 0
announced 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
fired 0
Jimenez 0
because 0
they 0
believed 0
such 0
behavior 0
was 0
immoral, 1
uncalled 0
for, 0
and 0
not 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
Rumble’s 0
welcoming 0
personality. 0

On 0
their 0
Facebook 0
page, 0
they 0
wrote, 0
“…We 0
have 0
since 0
terminated 0
this 0
employee, 0
as 0
his 0
actions 0
go 0
against 0
everything 0
that 0
this 0

stands 0
for. 0

Rumble 0
has, 0
and 0

as 0

could 0
possibly 0
be. 0

THIS 0

IS 0
A 0

FOR 1
EVERYONE! 1

No 0

identity, 0
and 0

stance, 0
you 0
are 0
welcomed 0
here!” 0
Rumble 0
said 0
on 0
Facebook 0
that 0
Jimenez 0
worked 0
as 0
a 0
“part-time 0
door 0
guy.” 0
They 0
added, 0
“We 0
do 0
not 0
condone 0
these 0
types 0
of 0
actions 0
or 0
behavior. 0

If 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
questions 0
or 0
concerns 0
please 0
message 0
us 0
privately. 0

We 0
support 0
and 0
appreciate 0
your 0
business.” 0

Contrary 0
to 0
what 0
you 0
might 0
believe 0
about 0
Jimenez… 0
he 0
is/was 0
NOT 1
a 0
Democrat! 0

No, 0
he 0
is 0
further 0
to 0
the 0
Left 0
and 0
was 0
an 0
active 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
Green 0
Party. 0

However, 0
upon 0
learning 0
of 0
his 0
behavior 0
the 0
local 0
Green 0
Party 0
told 0
the 0
media 0
that 0
Jimenez 0
had 0
been 0
cut 0
off 0
from 0
the 0
party 0
for 0
his 0
uncalled 0
for 0
attack 0
on 0
a 0
child. 0

“We 0
all 0
have 0
different 0
opinions 0
of 0
our 1
president, 1
but 0
we 0
don’t 0
take 0
it 0
out 0
on 0
innocent 1
kids 1
who 0
just 0
happen 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
hat 0
on,” 0
Gavino 0
Zarate, 0
secretary 0
of 0
the 0
Harris 0
County 0
Green 0
Party 0
told 0
Heavy. 0

“You 0
may 0
not 0
like 0
the 0
hat 0
or 0
you 0
may 0
not 0
like 0
the 0
president, 0
but 0
you 0
don’t 0
show 0
that 0
kind 0
of 0
aggression 0
toward 0
teenagers. 0

It 0
goes 0
against 0
everything 0
the 0
Green 0
Party 0
stands 0
for. 0

We 1
are 1
not 1
violent. 1

We 0
do 0
not 0
take 0
our 0
aggression 0
out 0
on 0
innocent 0
young 0
people.” 0

Some 0
on 0
the 0
right 0
have 0
connected 0
the 0
attack 0
to 0
Maxine 0
Waters’ 0
call 0
for 0
Democrats 0
to 0
confront 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
whenever, 0
and 0
wherever 0
they 0
happened 0
to 0
find 0
them. 0

Leftists 0
have 0
said 0
the 0
connection 0
is 0
unfair, 0
because 0
Waters’ 0
was 0
only 0
calling 0
for 0
accosting 0
Trump 0
administration 0
officials. 0

My 0
question 0
is; 0
how 0
big 0
of 0
a 0
leap 0
would 0
it 0
be 0
for 0
a 0
normal, 0
rational 0
adult 0
to 0
go 0
from 0
confronting 0
administration 0
officials 0
to 0
attacking 0
the 0
people 0
who 0
elected 0
them 0
to 0
power? 0

Not 0
much 0
in 0
my 0
mind. 0

The 0
reality 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Democrats 0
are 0
as 0
much 0
to 0
blame 0
for 0
the 0
corrosive 1
and 0
ugly 1
rhetoric 0

today 0

Sessions, 0
who 0
was 0
a 0
Trump 0
campaign 0
adviser 0
and 0
the 0
first 0
sitting 0
senator 0
to 0
endorse 0
his 0
candidacy, 0
recused 0
himself 0
from 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe 0
in 0
March 0
2016 0
because 0
he 0
expected 0
the 0
campaign 0
to 0
be 0
one 0
focus 0
of 0
the 0
investigation. 0

That 0
gave 0
the 0
reins 0
to 0
his 0
deputy 0
Rod 0
Rosenstein, 0
who 0
later 0
appointed 0

Trump 0
has 0
publicly 0
criticized 0
Sessions 0
before, 0
tweeting 0
in 0
June 0
that 0
the 1
Mueller 1
‘witch 1
hunt’ 1
was 0
only 0
proceeding 0
‘because 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
didn’t 0
tell 0
me 0
he 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
recuse 0
himself.’ 0

‘I 0
would 0
have 0
quickly 0
picked 0
someone 0
else. 0

So 1
much 1
time 1
and 1
money 1
wasted, 1
so 1
many 1

Sessions 0
knew 0
better 0

most 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
No 0
Collusion’ 0
with 0

added. 0

the 0

and 0
the 0
nation’s 0
top 0
law 0
enforcer 0
come 0
as 0
Mueller’s 0
team 0
is 0
prosecuting 0
former 0

chairman 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
on 0
money 0
laundering, 0
tax 0
evasion 0
and 0
bank 0
fraud 0
charges. 0

The 0
allegations 0
in 0
that 0
trial, 0
which 0
began 0
Tuesday, 0
are 0
related 0
to 0
Manafort’s 0
financial 0
dealings 0
long 0
before 0
he 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
cycle. 0

But 0
firing 0
Mueller 0
would 0
likely 0
send 0
a 0
signal 0
to 0
Democrats 0
that 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
is 0
worried 0
about 0
potential 1
blowback 1

blared: 0

"The 0
Pentagon 0
and 0
State 0
Department 0
have 0
already 0
condemned 0
Iran 0
and 0
thrown 0
their 0
support 0
behind 0
Israel. 0

The 0
question 0
now 0
is 0
whether 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
will 0
go 0
further. 0

... 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Rex 0
Tillerson 0
(has) 0
affirmed 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
seeks 0
not 0
only 0

security 0
but 0
to 0
deny 0
Iran 0
its 0
'dreams 0
of 0
a 0
northern 0
arch' 0
from 0
Tehran 0
to 0

A 0
good 0
way 0
to 0
achieve 0
both 0

would 0
be 0
back 0
Israel's 0
response 0
to 0

Chagai 0
Tzuriel 0
, 0
who 0
heads 0
the 0
Israeli 0
Ministry 0
of 0
Intelligence, 0
echoed 0
the 0
FDD: 0
"If 1
you 1
(Americans) 1
are 1
committed 1

countering 1
Iran 1
in 1

region, 1
then 1
you 1
must 1
do 1
so 1
in 1
Syria--first." 1

Our 0
orders 0
have 0
been 0
cut. 0

Iran 0
has 0
dismissed 0
as 0
"lies" 1
and 1
"ridiculous" 1
the 0
charge 0
that 0
it 0
sent 0
the 0
drone 0
into 0
Israeli 0
airspace. 0

If 0
Tehran 0
did, 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
monumental 1
stupidity. 1

Not 0
only 0
did 0
the 0
drone 0
bring 0
devastating 0
Israeli 0
reprisals 0
against 0
Syria 0
and 0
embarrass 0
Iran's 0
ally 0
Russia, 0
it 0
brought 0
attacks 0
on 0
Russian-provided 0
and 0
possibly 0
Russian-manned 0

Moreover, 0
in 0
recent 0
months 0
Iranian 0
policy--suspending 0
patrol 0
boat 0
harassment 0
of 0
U.S. 0
warships--appears 0
crafted 0
to 0
ease 0
tensions 0
and 0
provide 0
no 0
new 0
causes 0
for 0
Trump 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Hassan 0
Rouhani 0
regards 0
as 0
his 0
legacy. 0

Indeed, 0
why 0
would 0
Iran, 0
which, 0
with 0
Assad, 0
Russia 0
and 0
Hezbollah, 0
is 0
among 0
the 0
victors 0
in 0
Syria's 0
six-year 0
civil 0
war, 0
wish 0
to 0
reignite 0
the 0
bloodletting 0
and 0
bring 0
Israeli 0
and 0
U.S. 0
firepower 0
in 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
side? 0

In 0
Syria's 0
southeast, 0
another 0
incident 0
a 0
week 0
ago 0
may 0
portend 0
an 0
indefinite 0
U.S. 0
stay 0
in 0
that 0
broken 0
and 0
bleeding 0
country. 0

To 0
recapture 0
oil 0
fields 0
lost 0
in 0
the 0
war, 0
forces 0
backed 0
by 0
Assad 0
crossed 0
the 0
Euphrates 0
into 0
territory 0
taken 0
from 0
ISIS 0
by 0
the 0
U.S. 0
and 0
our 0
Kurd 0
allies. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
response 0
was 0
a 0
barrage 0
of 0
air 0
and 0
artillery 0
strikes 0
that 0
killed 0
100 0
soldiers. 0

What 0
this 0
signals 0
is 0
that, 0
though 0
ISIS 0
has 0
been 0
all 0
but 0
evicted 0
from 0
Syria, 0
the 0
U.S. 0
intends 0
to 0
retain 0
that 0
fourth 0
of 0
Syria 0
as 0
a 0
bargaining 1
chip 1
in 0
negotiations. 0

In 0
the 0
northwest, 0
Turkey 0
has 0
sent 0
its 0
Syrian 0
allies 0
to 0
attack 0
Afrin 0
and 0
President 0
Recep 0
Tayyip 0
Erdogan 0
has 0
threatened 0
Manbij, 0
80 0
miles 0
to 0
the 0
east, 0
where 0
U.S. 0
troops 0
commingle 0
with 0
the 0
Kurd 0
defenders 0
and 0
U.S. 0
generals 0
were 0
visible 0
last 0
week. 0

Midweek, 0
Erdogan 1
exploded: 1
"(The 0
Americans) 0
tell 0
us, 0
'Don't 0
come 0
to 0
Manbij.' 0

We 0
will 0
come 0
to 0
Manbij 0
to 0
hand 0
over 0
these 0
territories 0
to 0
their 0
rightful 0
owners." 0

The 0
U.S. 0
and 0
Turkey, 0
allies 0
for 0
six 0
decades, 0
with 0
the 0
largest 0
armies 0
in 0
NATO, 0
may 0
soon 0
be 0
staring 0
down 0
each 0
other's 0
gun 0
barrels. 0

Has 1
President 1
Trump 1
thought 1
through 1
where 1
we 1
are 1
going 1
with 1
this 1
deepening 1
commitment 1
in 1
Syria, 1
where 0
we 0
have 0
only 0
2,000 0
troops 0
and 0
no 0
allies 0
but 0
the 0
Kurds, 0
while 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
side 0
is 0
the 0
Syrian 0
army, 0
Hezbollah, 0
Russia 0
and 0
Iran, 0
and 0
Shiite 0
militias 0
from 0
Iraq, 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
Pakistan? 0

Clearly, 0
we 0
have 0
an 0
obligation 0
not 0
to 0
abandon 0
the 0
Kurds, 0
who 0
took 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
casualties 0
in 0
liberating 0
eastern 0
Syria 0
from 0
ISIS. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
strategic 0
interest 0
in 0
not 0
losing 0
Turkey 0
as 0
an 0
ally. 0

But 0
this 0
calls 0
for 0
active 1
diplomacy, 1
not 1
military 1
action. 1

And 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
rebels 0
have 0
been 0
defeated 0
and 0
the 0
civil 0
war 0
is 0
almost 0
over, 0
what 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
cost 0
and 0
what 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
prospects 0
of 0
fighting 0
a 0
new 0
and 0
wider 0
war? 0

What 0
would 0
victory 0
look 0
like? 0

Bibi 0
and 0
the 0
FDD 0
want 0
to 0
see 0
U.S. 0
power 0
deployed 0
alongside 0
that 0
of 0
Israel, 0
against 0
Iran, 0
Assad 0
and 0
Hezbollah. 0

But 0
while 0
Israel's 0
interests 0
are 0
clear, 0
what 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
U.S. 1
vital 1
interest? 1

What 1
outcome 1
would 1
justify 1
another 1
U.S. 1
war 1
in 1
a 1
region 1
where 1
all 1
the 1
previous 1
wars 1
in 1
this 1
century 1
have 1
left 1
us 1
bleeding, 1
bankrupt, 1
divided 1
and 1
disillusioned? 1

When 1
he 1
was 1
running 1
, 1
Donald 1
Trump 1
seemed 1
to 1
understand 1
this. 1

Dwight 0

in 0

a 0
fire 0
that 0

a 0

The 0
evidence 0
at 0
trial 0
regarding 0
the 0
Hammonds’ 0
responsibility 0
for 0
the 0
fire 0
was 0
conflicting, 0
and 0
the 0
jury 0
acquitted 0
them 0
on 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
charges. 0

At 0
the 0
Hammonds’ 0
original 0
sentencing, 0
the 0
judge 0
noted 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
respected 0
in 0
the 0
community 0
and 0
that 0
imposing 0
the 0

minimum, 0

would 0
“shock 1

“grossly 1

of 0
their 0
conduct. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
the 0

imposed 0
significantly 0
lesser 0

The 0
previous 0

that 0
resulted 0
in 0
the 0
Hammonds 0
being 0
sentenced 0
to 0
five 0

This 0
was 0

approximately 0
three 0

that 0

The 0
length 0

according 0
to 0
an 0
English 0

published 0

“Our 0

agreed 0
not 0
to 0
stamp 0

whether 0

for 0

of 0

own,” 0
Kristine 0
Phillips 0
and 0
Deanna 0
Paul 0
wrote 0
for 0
The 0
Post. 0

After 0

repeated 0
protests, 0
Police 0
Chief 0
U. 0
Reneé 0
Hall 0
gave 0
contradictory 0
explanations 0
last 0
week 0
for 0
why 0
she 0
could 0
not 0
fire 0
the 0
officer. 0

She 0
told 0
a 0
town 0
hall 0
that 0
“local, 0
state 0
and 0
federal 0
laws 0
prohibit 0
me 0
from 0
taking 0
action,” 0
according 0
to 0
ABC 0
affiliate 0
WFAA. 0

Two 0

days 0
later, 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Morning 0
News 0
reported 0
that 0
police 0
could 0
fire 0
Guyger 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
plan 0
to 0
review 0
her 0
employment 0
until 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
wrapped 0
up 0
— 0
probably 0
months 0
away. 0

In 0
a 0
statement, 0
Hall 0
said 0
that 0
any 0
disciplinary 0
investigation 0
would 0
risk 0
compromising 0
the 0
criminal 0
case. 0

“That 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
risk 0
I 0
am 0
willing 0
to 0
take,” 0
she 0
said. 0

Police 0

did 0
not 0
explain 0
what 0
changed 0
by 0
Monday, 0
when 0
the 0
department 0
announced 0
that 0
an 0
internal-affairs 0
investigation 0
had 0
been 0
launched 0
and 0
already 0
“concluded” 0
that 0
Guyger’s 0
arrest 0
was 0
a 0
fireable 0
offense. 0

The 0
officer, 0
who 0
was 0
hired 0
in 0
late 0
2013, 0
was 0
terminated 0
during 0
a 0
hearing 0
Monday 0
morning 0
“for 0
her 0
actions.” 0

The 0

statement 0
notes 0
that 0
Guyger 0
can 0
appeal 0
her 0
firing. 0

Police 0
did 0
not 0
comment 0
on 0
whether 0
Hall 0
is 0
still 0
worried 0
that 0
the 0
termination 0
might 0
affect 0
the 0
criminal 0
investigation. 0

As 0

Paul 0
wrote 0
for 0
The 0
Post, 0
the 0
more 0
significant 0
legal 0
questions 0
are 0
whether 0
Guyger 0
is 0
prosecuted 0
as 0
a 0
police 0
officer 0
or 0
civilian 0
and 0
whether 0
a 0
jury 0
decides 0
she 0
acted 0
reasonably 0
in 0
using 0
deadly 0
force. 0

President 0

Immigration 0

To 1

On 0
Monday, 0
President 0

what 0
he 0
sees 0
as 0
an 0
ideal 0

during 0
a 0

“We 0

where 0
when 0
people 0
come 0
in 0
illegally, 0
they 0
have 0
to 0
go 0
out,” 0
Trump 0
told 0
reporters. 0

“A 0
nice 0
simple 0
system 0
that 0
works.” 0

Trump 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
system 0
that 0
Mexico 0
uses 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
illegals 0
by 0
holding 0
them 0
a 0
few 0
hours 0
and 0
then 0
sending 0
them 0
away 0
is 0
preferable 0
to 0

I 0
completely 0
agree. 0

In 0
fact, 0
I've 0
often 0
said 0
if 0
we 0
catch 0
people 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
border, 0
we 0
should 0
not 0
even 0
bring 0
them 0
into 0
the 0
system 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
citizens, 0
but 0
walk 0
them 0
back 0
over 0
the 0
border 0
and 0
make 0
sure 0
they 0
keep 0
walking. 0

Often, 0
by 0
putting 0
illegals 0
into 0
the 0
system, 0
it 0
takes 0
years 0
to 0
deport 0
them, 0
which 0
costs 0
the 0
American 1
people 1
lots 0
of 0
money. 0

That 0
system 0
would 0
require 0
more 0
judges 0
to 0
handle 0
more 0
illegals 0
and 0
Trump 0
ripped 0
the 0
calls 0
for 0
more 0
judges 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
a 0
more 0
"simple 0
immigration 0
plan." 0

“We 0
want 0
strong 0
borders 0
and 0
we 0
want 0
no 0
crime,” 0
Trump 0
said. 0

“The 1
Democrats 1
want 1
open 1
borders 1
and 1
they 1
don’t 1
care 1
about 1
crime.” 1

Trump 0
then 0
called 0
on 0
Congress 0
to 0
correct 0
the 0
problems 0
created 0
by 0
legislation 0
with 0
more 0
legislation. 0

“The 0
laws 0
are 0
obsolete, 0
the 0
laws 0
are 0
horrible, 1
having 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
border, 0
both 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
security 0
and 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
taking 0
care 0
of 0
people,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“We 1
want 1
children 1
staying 1
together,” 1
Trump 0
said, 0
blasting 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
report 0
that 0
said 0
he 0
didn't 0
really 0
want 0
to 0
sign 0
his 0
executive 0
order 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
would 0
keep 0
families 0
together 0
in 0
detention 0
while 0
they 0
awaited 0
the 0
judicial 0
process. 0

Of 0
course, 0
Trump 0
has 0
inherited 0
a 0
problem 0
that 0
has 0
existed 0
for 0
several 0
administrations, 0
both 0
Republican 0
and 0
Democrat, 0
for 0
decades. 0

It 0
is 0
time 0
that 0
Congress 0
sure 0
up 0
things 0
so 0
that 0
America's 1
tax 1
dollars 1
are 0
not 0
bound 0
up 0
in 0
a 0
worthless 1
judicial 0
process 0
when 0
people 0
are 0
clearly 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
illegally. 0

Sadly, 0
too 0
many 0
people 0
want 0
more 0
amnesty 0
which 0
begs 0
the 0
question 0
if 0
any 0
of 0
them 0
take 0
the 0
law 0
seriously 0
in 0
the 0
first 0
place. 0

We 0
continue 0
our 0
discussion 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
now 0
in 0
the 0
Ecuadorian 0
embassy 0
in 0
Great 0
Britain. 0

John 0
Pilger, 0
it 0
is 0
great 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
you 0
again. 0

But 0
it 0
is 0
a 1
profound 1
tragedy, 1
John, 0
the 0
way 0
they 0
are 0
treating 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
this 0
prolific 1
journalist 1
and 1
publisher 1
who 0
so 0
many 0
other 0
journalists 0
have 0
depended 0
on 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

He 0
has 0
been 0
totally 1
left 1
out 1
in 1
the 1
cold 1
to 1
fend 1
for 1
himself. 1

John 0
Pilger: 0
I 0
have 0
never 0
known 0
anything 0
like 0
it. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
eerie 1
silence 1
around 0
the 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
case. 0

Julian 0
has 0
been 0
vindicated 0
in 0
every 0
possible 0
way 0
and 0
yet 0
he 0
is 0
isolated 0
as 0
few 0
people 0
are 0
these 0
days. 0

He 0
is 0
cut 0
off 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
tools 0
of 0
his 0
trade, 0
visitors 0
aren’t 0
allowed. 0

I 0
was 0
in 0
London 0
recently 0
and 0
I 0
couldn’t 0
see 0
him, 0
although 0
I 0
spoke 0
to 0
people 0
who 0
had 0
seen 0
him. 0

Rafael 0
Correa, 0
the 0
former 0
president 0
of 0
Ecuador, 0
said 0
recently 0
that 0
he 1
regarded 1
what 1
they 1
are 1
doing 1
to 1
Julian 1
now 1
as 1
torture. 1

It 0
was 0
Correa’s 0
government 0
that 0
gave 0
Julian 0
political 0
refuge, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
betrayed 0
now 0
by 0
his 0
successor, 0
the 0
government 0
led 0
by 0
Lenin 0
Moreno, 0
which 0
is 0
back 0
to 0
sucking 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
in 1
the 1
time-honored 1
way, 1
with 0
Julian 0
as 0
the 0
pawn 0
and 0
victim. 0

Should 0
be 0
a 1
‘Constitutional 1
Hero’ 1

But 0
really 0
it 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
the 0
British 0
government. 0

Although 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
in 0
a 0
foreign 0
embassy 0
and 0
actually 0
has 0
Ecuadorian 0
nationality, 0
his 0
right 0
of 0
passage 0
out 0
of 0
that 0
embassy 0
should 0
be 0
guaranteed 0
by 0
the 0
British 0
government. 0

The 0
United 0
Nations 0
Working 0
Party 0
on 0
Unlawful 0
Detentions 0
has 0
made 0
that 0
clear. 0

Britain 0
took 0
part 0
in 0
an 0
investigation 0
which 0
determined 0
that 0
Julian 0
was 0
a 0
political 0
refugee 0
and 0
that 0
a 1
great 1
miscarriage 1
of 1
justice 1
had 0
been 0
imposed 0
on 0
him. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
good 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
doing 0
this, 0
Dennis, 0
because 0
even 0
in 0
the 0
media 0
outside 0
the 0
mainstream, 0
there 0
is 0
this 0
silence 0
about 0
Julian. 0

The 0
streets 0
outside 0
the 0
embassy 0
are 1
virtually 1
empty, 1
whereas 0
they 1
should 1
be 1
full 1
of 1
people 1
saying 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
with 1
you. 1

The 0
principles 0
involved 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
are 0
absolutely 1
clear-cut. 1

Number 0
one 0
is 0
justice. 0

The 1
injustice 1
done 1
to 1
this 1
man 1
is 1
legion, 1
both 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
the 1
bogus 1
Swedish 1
case 1
and 0
now 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
must 0
remain 0
in 0
the 0
embassy 0
and 0
can’t 0
leave 0
without 0
being 0
arrested, 0
extradited 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
ending 1
up 1
in 1
a 1
hell 1
hole. 1

But 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
about 1
freedom 1
of 1
speech, 1
about 1
our 1
right 1
to 1
know, 1
which 1
is 1
enshrined 1
in 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
Constitution. 1

If 0
the 0
Constitution 0
were 0
taken 0
literally, 0
Julian 0
would 0
be 0
a 1
constitutional 1
hero, 1
actually. 0

Instead, 0
I 0
understand 0
the 0
indictment 0
they 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
concoct 0
reads 0
like 0
a 0
charge 0
of 0
espionage! 0

It’s 1
so 1
ridiculous.That 1
is 0
the 0
situation 0
as 0
I 0
see 0
it, 0
Dennis. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
happy 0
one 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
one 0
that 0
people 0
should 0
rally 0
to 0
quickly. 0

DB: 0
His 1
journalistic 1
brethren 1
are 0
sounding 0
like 0
his 0
prosecutors. 0

They 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
behind 0
Russia-gate 1
freaks 1
like 0
Congressman 0
Adam 0
Schiff 0
and 0
Mike 0
Pompeo, 0
who 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
see 0
Assange 0
in 1
jail 1
forever 1
or 1
even 1
executed. 1

How 0
do 0
you 0
respond 0
to 0
journalists 0
acting 0
like 0
prosecutors, 0
some 0
of 0
whom 0
used 0
his 0
material 0
to 0
do 0
stories? 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
terrible 0
time 0
for 0
journalism. 0

JP: 0
You 0
are 0
absolutely 0
right: 0
It 0
is 0
a 0
terrible 0
time 0
for 0
journalism. 0

I 1
have 1
never 1
known 1
anything 1
quite 1
like 1
it 1
in 1
my 1
career. 1

That 0
said, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
new. 0

There 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
a 0
so-called 0
mainstream 0
which 0
really 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
great 0
power 0
in 0
media. 0

It 0
has 0
always 0
existed, 0
particularly 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

The 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize 0
this 0
year 0
was 0
awarded 0
to 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
and 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
for 0
witch-hunting 1
around 1
Russia-gate! 1

They 0
were 0
praised 0
for 0
“how 0
deeply 0
sourced 0
their 0
investigations 0
were.” 0
Their 1
investigations 1
turned 1
up 1
not 1
a 1
shred 1
of 1
real 1
evidence 1
to 0
suggest 0
any 0
serious 0
Russian 0
intervention 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
election. 0

Like 0
Webb 0

The 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
case 0
reminds 0
me 0
of 0
the 0
Gary 0
Webb 0
case. 0

Bob 0
Parry 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
Gary 0
Webb’s 0
few 0
supporters 0
in 0
the 0
media. 0

Webb’s 0
“Dark 0
Alliance” 0
series 0
contained 0
evidence 0
that 0
cocaine 0
trafficking 0
was 0
going 0
on 0
with 0
the 0
connivance 0
of 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Later 0
Webb 0
was 1
hounded 1
by 0
fellow 0
journalists 0
and, 0
unable 0
to 0
find 0
work, 0
he 0
eventually 0
committed 0
suicide. 0

The 0
CIA 0
Inspector 0
General 0
subsequently 0
vindicated 0
him. 0

Now, 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
a 0
long 0
way 0
from 0
taking 0
his 0
own 0
life. 0

His 0
resilience 0
is 0
remarkable. 0

But 0
he 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
human 0
being 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
taken 1
such 1
a 1
battering. 1

Probably 0
the 0
hardest 0
thing 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
take 0
is 0
the 1
utter 1
hypocrisy 1
of 1
news 1
organizations—like 1
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times, 0
which 0
published 0
the 0
WikiLeaks 0
“War 0
Logs” 0
and 0
“Cablegate,” 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
The 0
Guardian, 0
which 0
has 0
taken 0
a 1
vindictive 1
delight 1
in 1
tormenting 1
Julian. 1

The 0
Guardian 0
a 0
few 0
years 0
ago 0
got 0
a 0
Pulitzer 0
Prize 0
writing 0
about 0
Snowden. 0

But 0
their 0
coverage 0
of 0
Snowden 0
left 0
him 0
in 0
Hong 0
Kong. 0

It 0
was 0
WikiLeaks 0
that 0
got 0
Snowden 0
out 0
of 0
Hong 0
Kong 0
and 0
to 0
safety. 0

Professionally, 0
I 1
find 1
this 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
unsavory 1
and 1
immoral 1
things 1
I 1
have 1
seen 1
in 1
my 1
career. 1

The 0
persecution 0
of 0
this 0
man 0
by 0
huge 0
media 0
organizations 0
which 0
have 0
drawn 0
great 0
benefit 0
from 0
WikiLeaks. 0

One 1
of 1
Assange’s 1
great 1
tormentors, 1
The 1
Guardian‘s 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
made 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
money 0
with 0
a 0
Hollywood 0
version 0
of 0
a 0
book 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
David 0
Lee 0
wrote 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
basically 0
attacked 0
their 0
source. 0

I 0
suppose 0
you 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
psychiatrist 0
to 0
understand 0
all 0
of 0
this. 0

My 0
understanding 0
is 0
that 0
so 0
many 0
of 0
these 0
journalists 0
are 0
shamed. 0

They 0
realize 0
that 0
WikiLeaks 0
has 0
done 0
what 0
they 0
should 0
have 0
done 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
to 0
tell 0
us 0
how 0
governments 0
lie. 0

DB: 0
One 0
thing 0
that 0
disturbs 0
me 0
greatly 0
is 0
the 0
way 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
Western 0
corporate 0
press 0
speculate 0
about 0
Russian 0
involvement 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
2016 0
election, 0
that 0
it 1
was 1
a 1
hack 1
through 1
Julian 1
Assange. 1

Any 0
serious 0
investigator 0
would 0
want 0
to 0
know 0
who 0
would 0
be 0
motivated. 0

And 0
yet 0
the 0
possibility 0
that 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
the 1
dozen 1
or 1
so 1
pissed-off 1
people 1
who 0
went 0
to 0
work 0
for 0
the 1
Clinton 1
machine 1
and 0
learned 0
from 0
the 0
inside 0
that 0
the 0
DNC 0
was 0
all 0
about 0
getting 0
rid 0
of 0
Bernie 0
Sanders…this 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
story! 0

Eight 0
Hundred 0
Thousand 0
Disclosures 0
on 0
Russia 0

JP: 0
What 0
happened 0
to 0
Sanders 0
and 0
the 0
way 0
that 0
he 1
was 1
rolled 1
by 1
the 1
Clinton 1
organization, 1
everybody 0
knows 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
story. 0

And 0
now 0
we 0
have 0
the 0
DNC 0
suing 0
WikiLeaks! 0

There’s 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
farcical 1
element 1
to 0
this. 0

I 0
mean, 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
came 0
from 0
the 0
Russians. 0

That 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
somehow 0
in 1
bed 1
with 1
the 1
Russians 1
is 1
ludicrous. 1

WikiLeaks 0
published 0
about 0
800,000 0
major 0
disclosures 0
about 0
Russia, 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
extremely 1
critical 1
of 0
the 0
Russian 0
government. 0

If 0
you 0
are 0
a 0
government 0
and 0
you 0
are 0
doing 0
something 0
untoward 0
or 0
you 0
are 0
lying 0
to 0
your 0
people 0
and 0
WikiLeaks 0
gets 0
the 0
documents 0
to 0
show 0
it, 0
they 0
will 0
publish 0
no 0
matter 0
who 0
you 0
are, 0
be 0
they 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
Russia. 0

DB: 0
Randy 0
Credico, 0
because 0
of 0
his 0
work 0
and 0
his 0
decision 0
to 0
devote 0
a 0
very 0
high-profile 0
series 0
to 0
the 0
persecution 0
of 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
recently 0
found 0
himself 0
under 0
attack. 0

He 0
went 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Roast 0
and, 0
after 0
having 0
a 0
nice 0
discussion 0
with 0
Congressman 0
Schiff, 0
he 1
yelled 1
out 1
“What 0
about 0
Julian 0
Assange?” 0
The 0
room 0
was 0
packed 0
full 0
of 0
reporters 0
but 0
Randy 0
was 0
attacked 0
and 0
dragged 0
out. 0

It 0
was 0
if 0
everyone 0
there 0
was 0
embarrassed 0
to 0
recognize 0
that 0
one 1
of 1
their 1
brethren 1
was 1
being 1
brutalized. 1

JP: 0
Randy 0
shouted 0
some 0
truth. 0

It 0
is 0
very 0
similar 0
to 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
Ray 0
McGovern. 0

Ray 0
is 0
a 0
former 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
but 0
extremely 0
principled. 0

I 0
might 0
suggest 0
he 1
is 1
a 1
renegade 1
now. 0

DB: 0
It 1
was 1
hysterical 1
to 0
watch 0
these 0
four 0
armed 0
guards 0
who 0
kept 0
shouting 0
“Stop 0
resisting, 0
stop 0
resisting!” 0
and 0
they 0
are 0
beating 1
the 1
hell 1
out 1
of 1
him! 1

JP: 0
I 0
thought 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Ray 0
being 1
hauled 1
off 1
was 0
particularly 0
telling. 0

These 1
four 1
overweight, 1
obviously 1
ill-trained 1
young 1
men 1
manhandling 1
Ray, 0
who 0
is 0
78 0
years 0
old. 0

There 0
was 0
something 0
highly 0
emblematic 0
about 0
that 0
for 0
me. 0

He 0
stood 0
up 0
to 0
challenge 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
hand 0
over 0
leadership 0
to 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
torture. 0

It 0
is 0
both 1
shocking 1
and 1
surreal, 1
which 0
of 0
course 0
the 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
case 0
is 0
as 0
well. 0

But 0
real 0
journalism 0
should 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
through 0
the 1
shocking 1
and 1
the 1
surreal 1
and 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
truth. 0

There 0
is 0
so 0
much 0
collusion 0
now, 0
with 0
all 0
these 0
dark 1
and 1
menacing 1
developments. 1

It 0
is 0
almost 0
as 0
if 0
the 1
word 1
“journalism” 1
is 1
becoming 1
blighted. 1

DB: 0
There 0
has 0
certainly 0
been 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
collusion 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
Israel. 0

Then 0
the 0
word 0
“collusion” 0
is 0
quite 0
appropriate. 0

JP:That’s 0
the 0
ultimate 0
collusion. 0

But 0
that’s 0
collusion 1
with 0
silence. 0

Never 1
has 1
there 1
been 1
a 1
collusion 1
like 1
the 1
one 1
between 1
the 1
U.S. 1
and 1
Israel. 1

It 0
suggests 0
another 0
word 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
“immunity.” 0
It 0
has 0
a 0
moral 0
immunity, 0
a 0
cultural 0
immunity, 0
a 0
geopolitical 0
immunity, 0
a 0
legal 0
immunity, 0
and 0
certainly 0
a 0
media 0
immunity. 1

We 0
see 0
the 0
gunning 1
down 1
of 0
over 0
60 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
inauguration 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
U.S. 0
embassy 0
in 0
Jerusalem. 0

Israel 0
has 0
some 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
wickedly 1
experimental 1
munitions 1
in 1
the 1
world 1
and 0
they 0
fired 0
them 0
at 0
people 0
who 0
were 0
protesting 0
the 0
occupation 0
of 0
their 0
homeland 0
and 0
trying 0
to 0
remind 0
people 0
of 0
the 0
Nakba 0
and 0
the 0
right 0
of 0
return. 0

In 0
the 0
media 0
these 0
were 0
described 0
as 0
“clashes.” 0
Although 0
they 0
did 0
become 0
so 0
bad 0
that 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
in 0
a 0
later 0
edition 0
changed 0
its 0
front 0
page 0
headline 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
Israel 0
was 0
actually 0
killing 0
people. 0

A 0
rare 0
moment, 0
indeed, 0
when 0
the 0
immunity, 0
the 0
collusion 0
was 0
interrupted. 0

All 1
the 1
talk 1
of 1
Iran 1
and 1
nuclear 1
weapons 1
is 1
without 1
any 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
biggest 1
nuclear 1
power 1
in 1
the 1
Middle 1
East. 1

DB: 0
What 0
would 0
you 0
say 0
have 0
been 0
the 0
contributions 0
that 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
has 0
made 0
in 0
this 0
age 0
of 0
censorship 0
and 0
cowardice 1
in 1
journalism? 1

Where 0
does 0
he 0
come 0
into 0
the 0
picture? 0

JP:I 0
think 0
it 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
information. 0

If 0
you 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
when 0
WikiLeaks 0
started, 0
when 0
Julian 0
was 0
sitting 0
in 0
his 0
hotel 0
room 0
in 0
Paris 0
beginning 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
whole 0
thing 0
together, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
things 0
he 0
wrote 0
was 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
morality 0
in 0
transparency, 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
those 0
who 0
wish 0
to 0
control 0
our 0
lives 0
are 0
doing 0
in 0
secret. 0

The 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
what 0
governments 0
are 0
doing 0
in 0
our 0
name—on 0
our 0
behalf 0
or 0
to 0
our 0
detriment—is 0
our 0
moral 0
right. 0

Julian 0
feels 0
very 0
passionately 0
about 0
this. 0

There 0
were 0
times 0
when 0
he 0
could 0
have 0
compromised 0
slightly 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
possibly 0
help 0
his 0
situation. 0

There 0
were 0
times 0
when 0
I 0
said 0
to 0
him, 0
“Why 0
don’t 0
you 0
just 0
suspend 0
that 0
for 0
a 0
while 0
and 0
go 0
along 0
with 0
it?” 0
Of 0
course, 0
I 0
knew 0
beforehand 0
what 0
his 0
answer 0
would 0
be 0
and 0
that 0
was 0
“no.” 0
The 0
enormous 0
amount 0
of 0
information 0
that 0
has 0
come 0
from 0
WikiLeaks, 0
particularly 0
in 0
recent 0
years, 0
has 0
amounted 0
to 0
an 1
extraordinary 1
public 1
service. 1

I 0
was 0
reading 0
just 0
the 0
other 0
day 0
a 0
2006 0
WikiLeaks 0
cable 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
embassy 0
in 0
Caracas 0
which 0
was 0
addressed 0
to 0
other 0
agencies 0
in 0
the 0
region. 0

This 0
was 0
four 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
U.S. 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
rid 0
of 0
Chavez 0
in 0
a 0
coup. 0

It 0
detailed 0
how 0
subversion 0
should 0
work. 0

Of 0
course, 0
they 1
dressed 1
it 1
up 1
as 0
human 0
rights 0
work 0
and 0
so 0
on. 0

I 0
was 0
reading 0
this 0
official 0
document 0
thinking 0
how 0
the 0
information 0
contained 0
in 0
it 0
was 0
worth 0
years 0
of 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
distorted 0
reporting 0
from 0
Venezuela. 0

It 0
also 0
reminds 0
us 0
that 0
so-called 0
“meddling” 0
by 0
Russia 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
is 0
just 0
nonsense. 0

The 0
word 0
“meddling” 0
doesn’t 0
apply 0
to 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
action 0
implied 0
in 0
this 0
document. 0

It 0
is 0
intervention 0
in 0
another 0
country’s 0
affairs. 0

WikiLeaks 0
has 0
done 0
that 0
all 0
over 0
the 0
world. 0

It 0
has 0
given 0
people 0
the 0
information 0
they 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
have. 0

They 0
had 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
from 0
the 0
so-called 0
“War 0
Logs” 0
the 0
criminality 0
of 0
our 0
wars 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
Iraq. 0

They 1
had 1
a 1
right 1
to 0
find 0
out 0
about 0
Cablegate. 0

That’s 0
when, 0
on 0
Clinton’s 0
watch, 0
we 0
learned 0
that 0
the 0
NSA 0
was 0
gathering 0
personal 0
information 0
on 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
Security 0
Council, 0
including 0
their 0
credit 0
card 0
numbers. 0

You 0
can 0
see 0
why 0
Julian 0
made 0
enemies. 0

But 0
he 0
should 0
also 0
have 0
made 0
a 0
huge 0
number 0
of 0
friends. 0

This 0
is 0
critical 0
information 0
because 0
it 0
tells 0
us 0
how 0
power 0
works 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
never 0
learn 0
about 0
it 0
otherwise. 0

I 0
think 0
WikiLeaks 0
has 0
opened 0
a 0
world 0
of 0
transparency 0
and 1
put 1
flesh 1
on 1
the 1
expression 1
“right 0
to 0
know.” 0
This 0
must 0
explain 0
why 0
he 0
is 0
attacked 0
so 0
much, 0
because 0
that 0
is 0
so 0
threatening. 0

The 1
enemy 1
to 1
great 1
power 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
likes 1
of 1
the 1
Taliban, 1
it 1
is 1
us. 1

DB: 0
And 0
who 0
can 0
forget 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
“collateral 0
murder” 0
footage 0
by 0
Chelsea 0
Manning? 0

JP: 0
That 0
kind 0
of 0
thing 0

Vietnam 0
was 0
meant 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
open 0
war 0
but 0
really 0
it 0
wasn’t. 0

There 0
weren’t 0
the 0
cameras 0
around. 0

It 0
is 0
indeed 0
shocking 1
information 1
but 0
it 0
informs 0
people, 0
and 0
we 0
have 0
Chelsea 0
Manning’s 0
courage 0
to 0
thank 0
for 0
that. 0

DB: 0
Yes, 0
and 0
the 0
thanks 0
he 0
got 0
was 0
seven 0
years 0
in 0
solitary 0
confinement. 0

They 0
want 0
to 0
prosecute 0
Assange 0
and 0
maybe 0
hang 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
rafters 1
in 0
Congress, 0

about 1
Judith 1
Miller 1
and 1
The 1
New 1

There 0
is 0
no 0
end 0
of 0
horrific 1
examples 1
of 0
what 0

Note: 0
This 0
is 0
probably 0
a 0
reason 0
why 0
reporters 0
Laura 0
Loomer 0
and 0
Mike 0
Tokes 0
were 0
barred 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
presser. 0

They 0
would 0
have 0
posed 0
real 0
genuine 0
questions 0
of 0
Sheriff 0
Lombardo 0
and 0
forced 0
him 0
to 0
stumble 0
all 0
over 0
himself 0
in 0
answering 0
them. 0

The 0
words 0
“conspiracy 1
theorists” 1
are 0
being 0
bandied 0
about. 0

Are 1
they 1
for 1
real? 1

A 0
well-coordinated, 0
meticulously 0
planned 0
attack 0
on 0
concertgoers 0
leads 0
to 0
the 0
murder 0
of 0
58 0
Americans 0
at 0
a 0
country 0
music 0
festival 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas, 0
with 0
over 0
500 0
injured, 0
and 0
they 0
have 0
no 0
explanation 0
or 0
motive. 0

Do 1
the 1
FBI 1
and 1
law 1
enforcement 1
think 1
people 1
won’t 1
talk 1
about 1
it 1
or 1
speculate 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
happened? 1

Are 1
they 1
for 1
real? 1

Further, 1
the 1
FBI 1
insists 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
jihad 1
motive, 1
while 1
saying 1
they 1
don’t 1
know 1
his 1
motive. 1

How 0
can 0
they 0
possibly 0
hold 0
those 0
two 0
contradictory 0
ideas 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time? 0

The 0
sheriff, 0
alluding 0
to 0
allegations 0
of 0
a 0
conspiracy 0
between 0
his 0
department, 0
the 0
F.B.I., 0
and 0
MGM 0
— 0
supposedly 0
in 0
an 0
effort 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
legal 0
case 0
— 0
said, 0
“there 0
is 0
no 0
conspiracy.” 0

William 0
Jacobson 0
explains 0
the 0
latest 0
“revise” 0
by 0
the 0
authorities 0

the 0
now 0
infamously 0

Legal 0
Insurrection 0

Police 0

and 0
hotel 0
still 0
don’t 0
agree 0
on 0
some 0
details. 0

I 0
realize 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
heat 0
of 0
a 0
shooting, 0
particularly 0
a 0
mass 0
shooting, 0
it 0
may 0
take 0
some 0
time 0
for 0
a 0
precise 0
timeline 0
to 0
develop. 0

But 0
it 0
didn’t 0
take 0
very 0
long 0
for 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
to 0
release 0
a 0
precise 0
timeline. 0

The 0
initial 0
timeline 0
was 0
that 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
shooting 0
stopped 0
when, 0
approximately 0
6 0
minutes 0
after 0
he 0
started, 0
he 0
was 0
interrupted 0
by 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
from 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
hotel. 0

Paddock 0
then 0
turned 0
his 0
fire 0
into 0
the 0
hallway, 0
firing 0
some 0
200 0
bullets, 0
and 0
after 0
that 0
the 0
shooting 0
stopped 0
as 0
police 0
arrived. 0

That 0
was 0
Version 0
No. 0

1. 0

Some 0
days 0
later, 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
backed 0
away 0
from 0
that 0
timeline, 0
and 0
stated 0
that 0
the 0
security 0
guard 0
actually 0
arrived 0
6 0
minutes 0
before 0
Paddock 0
started 0
shooting 0
into 0
the 0
crowd 0
32 0
stories 0
below 0
him. 0

That 1
raised 1
a 1
number 1
of 1
question, 1
including 0
why 0
no 0
one 0
called 0
911 0
after 0
what 0
must 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
loud 0
volley 0
of 0
shots 0
in 0
a 0
hotel 0
hallway. 0

That 0
was 0
Version 0
No. 0

But 0
now 0
that 0
is 0
disputed, 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
said 0
Friday 0
that 0
the 0
gunman 0
who 0
opened 0
fire 0
on 0
a 0
country 0
music 0
festival 0
far 0
below 0
his 0
hotel 0
suite 0
did 0
not 0
shoot 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
that 0
rampage, 0
contradicting 1
a 1
timeline 1
they 1
had 1
offered 1
earlier 1
this 1
week…. 1

The 0
confusion 0
began 0
Monday 0
when 0
police 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
gunman 0
fired 0
at 0
the 0
hotel 0
security 0
guard, 0
Jesus 0
Campos, 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began, 0
not 0
during 0
the 0
massacre 0
as 0
they 0
had 0
said. 0

Lombardo 0
also 0
said 0
police 0
had 0
hunted 0
for 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
gunfire 0
and 0
that 0
officers 0
responding 0
to 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
floor 0
were 0
unaware 0
that 0
a 0
guard 0
was 0
shot 0
until 0
they 0
arrived 0
there, 0
at 0
which 0
point 0
the 0
shooting 0
rampage 0
had 0
ended. 0

MGM 0
Resorts 0
pushed 0
back 0
on 0
this 0
account, 0
first 0
saying 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
unspecified 0
inaccuracies 0
and 0
then, 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
releasing 0
a 0
statement 0
directly 0
contradicting 0
parts 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
police 0
had 0
said…. 0

Lombardo 0
had 0
said 0
Monday 0
that 0
Campos, 0
the 0
guard, 0
was 0
shot 0
at 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began 0
at 0
10:05 0
p.m. 0

This 0
six-minute 0
gap 0
relayed 0
by 0
Lombardo 0
left 0
uncertain 0
whether 0
there 0
was 0
any 0
lag 0
in 0
alerting 0
police 0
to 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
gunfire 0
during 0
critical 0
moments. 0

Police 0
said 0
officers 0
arrived 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
at 0
10:17 0
p.m., 0
two 0
minutes 0
after 0
Paddock 0
had 0
stopped 0
firing. 0

MGM, 0
though, 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
“confident” 0
that 0
the 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
time 0
was 0
inaccurate 0
and 0
“was 0
derived 0
from 0
a 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
report 0
manually 0
created 0
after 0
the 0
fact 0
without 0
the 0
benefit 0
of 0
information 0
we 0
now 0
have.” 0
The 0
company 0
also 0
disputed 0
the 0
suggestion 0
of 0
a 0
lag, 0
saying 0
the 0
shooting 0
rampage 0
began 0
within 0
a 0
minute 0
of 0
Campos 0
reporting 0
his 0
injury 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor. 0

On 0
Friday, 0
Lombardo 0
effectively 0
agreed 0
with 0
the 0
company’s 0
statement, 0
though 0
he 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
time 0
he 0
had 0
offered 0
four 0
days 0
earlier 0
“wasn’t 0
inaccurate 0
when 0
I 0
provided 0
it.” 0
Lombardo 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
told 0
this 0
time 0
had 0
been 0
written 0
by 0
someone 0
in 0
a 0
security 0
log. 0

Upon 0
investigation, 0
Lombardo 0
said, 0
police 0
learned 0
that 0
Campos 0
first 0
encountered 0
a 0
barricaded 0
door 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
at 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0

The 0
guard 0
was 0
eventually 0
fired 0
upon 0
by 0
Paddock 0
“in 0
close 0
proximity 0
to” 0
10:05 0
p.m., 0
when 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began, 0
Lombardo 0
continued. 0

Clear, 0
right? 0

Not 0
so 0
fast, 0
the 0
police 0
and 0
hotel 0
still 0
have 0
disagreement 0
over 0
important 0
details, 0
such 0
as 0
when 0
police 0
arrived 0
relative 0
to 0
Paddock’s 0
shooting 0
at 0
the 0
crowd: 0
An 0
enormous, 0
important 0
discrepancy 0
has 0
emerged 0
over 0
what 0
happened 0
during 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
massacre: 0
When 0
did 0
police 0
arrive 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
where 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
was 0
firing 0
his 0
deadly 0
fusillade 0
onto 0
concertgoers 0
below? 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
say 0
they 0
didn’t 0
get 0
to 0
the 0
floor 0
until 0
after 0
the 0
shooting 0
was 0
over. 0

But 0
MGM 0
Resorts 0
International, 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
Mandalay 0
Bay, 0
says 0
police 0
officers 0
were 0
there 0
shortly 0
after 0
the 0
shooting 0
began, 0
responding 0
to 0
a 0
report 0
of 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
being 0
shot. 0

The 0
discrepancy 0
could 0
raise 0
questions 0
about 0
whether 0
police 0
might 0
have 0
taken 0
steps 0
to 0
intervene 0
while 0
Paddock 0
was 0
launching 0
his 0
devastating 0
10-minute 0
onslaught…. 0

… 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
inquiries 0
about 0
when 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
notified 0
police 0
of 0
the 0
Campos 0
shooting, 0
MGM 0
Resorts 0
issued 0
a 0
statement 0
that 0
was 0
unequivocal: 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police 0
officers 0
accompanied 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
to 0
the 0
Campos 0
shooting 0
and 0
“immediately 0
responded.” 0
MGM 0
said 0
that 0
“Metro 0
officers 0
were 0
together 0
with 0
armed 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
officers 0
in 0
the 0
building 0
when 0
Campos 0
first 0
reported 0
that 0
shots 0
were 0
fired 0
over 0
the 0
radio. 0

These 0
Metro 0
officers 0
and 0
armed 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
officers 0
immediately 0
responded 0
to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor.” 0
The 0
statement 0
says 0
MGM 0
believes 0
Paddock 0
began 0
firing 0
out 0
the 0
window 0
of 0
his 0
room 0
within 0
40 0
seconds 0
of 0
Campos 0
reporting 0
his 0
shooting, 0
and 0
Lombardo 0
said 0
Friday, 0
“I 0
agree 0
with 0
the 0
statement.” 0
These 1
discrepancies 1
on 1
basic 1
facts 1
are 1
feeding 1
conspiracy 1
theories. 1

As 0
to 0
Paddock’s 0
motive, 0
still 0
nothing 0
from 0
the 0
investigation. 0

John, 0
what 0
is 0
the 0
latest 0
we 0
know 0
about 0
how 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
being 0
treated 0
and 0
his 0
current 0
state? 0

John 0
Pilger: 0
His 0
state 0
of 0
health 0
is 0
just 0
about 0
the 0
same, 0
as 0
I 0
understand 0
it. 0

He 0
needs 0
medical 0
attention, 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
treatment 0
you 0
get 0
only 0
in 0
a 0
hospital. 0

But 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
clear 0
to 0
him 0
that 0
if 0
he 0
attempts 0
to 0
go 0
to 0
a 0
hospital 0
he 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
given 0
free 0
passage 0
and 0
he 0
will 0
be 0
arrested. 0

Since 0
he 0
was 0
arrested 0
in 0
2010, 0
Assange 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
a 0
single 0
crime. 0

His 0
treatment 0
amounts 0
to 0
the 1
most 1
unprecedented 1
persecution. 1

Julian 0
could 0
leave 0
the 0
embassy 0
if 0
his 1
own 1
government, 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
his 1
homeland, 1
Australia, 1
applied 1
legitimate 1
diplomatic 1
pressure 1
on 1
behalf 1
of 1
its 1
citizen. 1

We 1
must 1
ask 1
ourselves 1
why 1
this 1
hasn’t 1
happened. 1

My 0
own 0
feeling 0
is 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
collusion 0
between 0
the 0
Australian, 0
the 0
British 0
and 0
the 0
US 0
governments–meant 0
to 0
close 0
down 0
WikiLeaks 0
completely 0
and/or 0
deliver 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
to 0
the 0
Americans. 0

Recently 0
the 0
Australian 0
foreign 0
minister, 0
Julie 0
Bishop, 0
traveled 0
with 0
senior 0
officials 0
to 0
London 0
and 0
to 0
Washington 0
and 0
raised 0
the 0
whole 0
matter 0
of 0
Julian. 0

But 0
they 0
raised 0
it 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
didn’t 0
support 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
a 0
government 0
should 0
represent 0
its 0
citizens. 0

These 0
people 0
listened 0
to 0
the 0
more 0
powerful 0
governments. 0

In 0
Washington 0
they 0
met 0
Mr. 0
Pompeo, 0
who 0
refused 0
to 0
discuss 0
Assange 0
altogether. 0

I 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
collusion 0
which 0
amounts 0
to 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
do 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Assange 0
whereby 0
he 0
might 0
be 0
allowed 0
free 0
passage 0
of 0
return 0
to 0
Australia 0
if 0
he 0
shuts 0
down 0
WikiLeaks. 0

I 0
think 0
that 0
is 0
very, 0
very 0
likely. 0

As 0
I 0
understand 0
Julian, 0
this 0
is 0
something 1
he 1
would 1
not 1
even 1
contemplate. 1

But 0
that 0
might 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
so-called 0
“wretched 1
deals” 1
that 0
are 0
being 0
offered 0
Assange. 0

Some 0
very 0
strange 0
things 0
are 0
being 0
said 0
by 0
senior 0
members 0
of 0
these 0
two 0
governments. 0

The 0
new 0
foreign 0
secretary 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
Kingdom, 0
Jeremy 0
Hunt, 0
said 0
sarcastically 0
that 0
the 1
British 1
police 1
would 1
offer 1
Julian 1
“a 1
warm 1
welcome” 1
when 1
he 1
came 1
out, 1
when 0
he 0
would 0
face 0
serious 0
charges. 0

There 0
are 0
no 0
serious 0
charges. 0

He 0
hasn’t 0
been 0
charged 0
with 0
anything. 0

of 1
this 1
man 1
has 1
been 1
something 1
that 1

community. 0

John, 0
I 0
would 0
like 0
you 0
to 0
explain 0
once 0
again 0
why 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
such 1
a 1
significant 1
journalist, 1
why 0
so 0
many 0
journalistic 0
institutions 0
have 0
collaborated 0
with 0
him 0
based 0
on 0
the 0
information 0
he 0
provided. 0

We 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
a 1
publisher 1
and 1
reporter 1
who 1
has 1
changed 1
history. 1

JP: 0
Nothing 1
in 1
my 1
time 1
as 1
a 1
journalist 1
has 1
equaled 1
the 1
rise 1
of 1
WikiLeaks 1
and 1
its 1
extraordinary 1
impact 1
on 1
journalism. 1

It 0
is 0
probably 0
the 1
only 1
journalistic 1
organization 1
that 1
has 1
a 1
100% 1
record 1
of 1
accuracy 1
and 1
authenticity! 1

All 0
of 0
WikiLeaks’ 0
revelations 0
have 0
been 0
authentic. 0

And 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
done 0
“without 0
fear 0
or 0
favor.” 0
Although 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
concentration 0
on, 0
say, 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton/Podesta 0
emails, 0
or 0
the 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Afghan 0
war 0
logs, 0
WikiLeaks 0
has 0
released 0
information 0
that 0
people 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
across 0
the 0
spectrum. 0

It 0
has 0
released 0
something 0
like 0
800,000 0
documents 0
from 0
Russia, 0
and 0
now 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
accused 0
of 0
being 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
Russia! 0

WikiLeaks’ 0
journalism 0
has 0
covered 0
a 0
universal 0
space 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
this 0
has 0
happened. 0

In 0
Tunisia, 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
WikiLeaks 0
documents 0
foretold 0
the 0
Arab 0
Spring. 0

The 0
people 0
at 0
the 0
forefront 0
of 0
the 0
uprising 0
in 0
Tunisia 0
credit 0
WikiLeaks 0
for 0
informing 0
them 0
of 0
what 0
their 0
repressive 0
government 0
was 0
doing 0
behind 0
their 0
backs. 0

In 0
Venezuela, 0
WikiLeaks 0
released 0
cables 0
which 0
described 0
in 0
great 0
detail 0
how 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
intended 0
to 0
subvert 0
the 0
government 0
of 0
Hugo 0
Chavez. 0

Some 0
of 0
this 0
was 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
when 0
there 0
was 0
still 0
a 0
collaboration 0
with 0
WikiLeaks. 0

The 0
Clinton/Podesta 0
emails, 0
which 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
made 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
people 0
resentful, 0
were 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times. 0

These 0
emails 0
showed 0
the 0
close 0
role 0
that 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation 0
played 0
in 0
support 0
of 0
extreme 1
jihadism 1
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

That 0
was 0
a 0
very 0
important 0
piece 0
of 0
information 0
for 0
people 0
to 0
know 0
and 0
understand. 0

By 0
doing 0
that, 0
WikiLeaks 0
performed 0
an 1
extraordinary 1
public 1
service, 1
while 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
making 0
some 0
very 0
serious 0
enemies. 0

Randy 0
Credico: 0
People 0
sometimes 0
forget 0
that, 0
apart 0
from 0
being 0
a 0
journalist, 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is 0
a 0
human 0
being. 0

You 0
have 0
known 0
him 0
a 0
long 0
time. 0

Could 0
you 0
give 0
us 0
a 0
feel 0
for 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
person 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
is? 0

JP: 0
Julian 0
is 0
a 1
very 1
principled 1
individual. 1

He 0
feels 0
very 0
strongly 0
about 0
the 0
moral 0
basis 0
of 0
WikiLeaks. 0

When 0
he 0
first 0
put 0
up 0
WikiLeaks, 0
he 0
wrote 0
that 0
the 0
whole 0
idea 0
of 0
transparency, 0
honoring 0
people’s 0
right 0
to 0
know, 0
was 0
the 0
central 0
aim 0
of 0
the 0
website. 0

He 0
feels 0
that 0
very 0
strongly. 0

Any 0
attempt 0
to 0
do 0
a 0
deal 0
with 0
Julian 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
WikiLeaks 0
will 0
no 0
doubt 0
be 0
resisted. 0

As 0
a 0
person, 0
Julian 0
is 0
an 1
extremely 1
interesting 1
man. 1

He 0
is 0
very 0
well 0
read. 0

He 0
studied 0
physics. 0

He 0
has 0
a 0
very 0
good 0
sense 0
of 0
humor, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
often 0
laughed 0
out 0
loud 0
with 0
him 0
about 0
situations 0
that 0
others 0
might 0
consider 0
too 0
bleak 0
to 0
discuss. 0

His 0
black 0
humor 0
is 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
his 0
survival 0
kit. 0

Obviously, 0
he 0
is 0
incredibly 0
resilient. 0

Personally, 0
I 0
could 0
never 0
endure 0
what 0
he 0
has, 0
especially 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

But 0
this 0
comes 0
with 0
a 0
cost 0
and 0
his 0
health 0
is 0
continuing 0
to 0
deteriorate. 0

Those 0
close 0
to 0
him 0
are 0
extremely 1
worried. 1

That 0
is 0
why 0
this 0
is 0
such 0
an 0
urgent 0
case 0
of 0
justice 0
toward 0
a 0

right 0

and 0
our 0
right 0
to 0

the 0
information 0
it 0
provides. 0

Only 0
seven 0
years 0
ago, 0
the 0
current 0
prime 0
minister 0
said 0
that 0
when 0
an 0
Australian 0
citizen 0
is 0
threatened 0
in 0
this 0
way 0
the 0
prime 0
minister 0
should 0
respond. 0

That 0
was 0
Turnbull 0
before 0
he 0
became 0
prime 0
minister. 0

Now 0
the 0
government 0
is 0
playing 0
its 0
usual 0
role 0
of 0
being 0
the 1
fifty-first 1
state 1
of 1
the 1
United 1
States. 1

It 1
is 1
a 1
true 1
disgrace. 1

RC: 0
What 1
about 1
Theresa 1
May 1
and 1
the 1
British 1
government? 1

Are 1
they 1
getting 1
pressure 1
from 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
or 1
are 1
there 1
internal 1
reasons 1
why 1
they 1
want 1
to 1
keep 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
quiet? 1

JP: 0
Everything 0
comes 0
down 0
to 0
the 0
relationship 0
with 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

Australia 0
has 0
an 1
almost 1
totally 1
servile 1
relationship 1
with 0
America, 0
in 0
which 0
its 0
national 0
security 0
structure, 0
much 0
of 0
its 0
academic 0
life 0
and 0
certainly 0
much 0
of 0
its 0
media 0
is 0
integrated 0
into 0
the 0
US 0
system. 0

That 0
is 0
not 0
entirely 0
the 0
case 0
in 0
Britain. 0

Since 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
its 0
empire 0
after 0
the 0
Second 0
World 0
War, 0
Britain 0
has 0
been 0
eager 0
to 0
play 0
a 0
secondary 0
role 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
imperial 0
power. 0

In 0
many 0
parts 0
of 0
the 0
world, 0
Britain 0
is 0
still 0
the 0
biggest 0
corporate 0
investor. 0

But 0
it 1
does 1
move 1
in 1
lockstep 1
with 1
the 1
US 1
on 0
much 0
of 0
its 0
foreign 0
policy. 0

It 0
is 0
interesting 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
corruption 0
that 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
relationship 0
produces. 0

Information 0
has 0
come 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Crown 0
Prosecution 0
Service 0
tried 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
Swedes 0
from 0
giving 0
up 0
the 0
case 0
against 0
Julian 0
on 0
bogus 1
sexual 1
assault 1
charges. 1

The 0
pressure 0
was 0
on 0
from 0
London 0
to 0
keep 0
it 0
going. 0

Julian 0
is 0
also 0
seen 0
as 0
defying 0
a 0
system 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
just 0
not 0
acceptable. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
real 0
element 0
of 0
vindictiveness 0
here. 0

The 0
Crown 0
Prosecution 0
Service 0
kept 0
this 0
case 0
going 0
when 0
otherwise 0
the 0
European 0
warrant 0
put 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
Swedes 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
abandoned 0
in 0
2013. 0

When 0
Julian 0
came 0
up 0
to 0
a 0
bail 0
hearing 0
last 0
year, 0
it 1
was 1
an 1
absolute 1
disgrace. 1

The 0
judge 0
described 0
Julian’s 0
circumstances 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
were 0
on 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
extended 0
vacation. 0

What 1
didn’t 1
emerge 1
was 1
the 1
whole 1
conflict 1
of 1
interest 1
in 1
this 1
hearing. 1

The 1
judge’s 1
husband 1
is 1
a 1
figure 1
deep 1
within 1
the 1
national 1
security 1
establishment 1
in 1
Britain 1
who 1
was 1
named 1
in 1
WikiLeaks 1
documents. 1

Because 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
serious 1
media 1
examining 1
the 1
whole 1
WikiLeaks 1
witch 1
hunt, 1
virtually 1
none 1
of 1
this 1
emerges. 1

DB: 0
The 0
corporate 0
press 0
has 0
a 0
major 0
responsibility 0
if 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
goes 0
down, 0
don’t 0
you 0
agree? 0

JP: 0
As 0
you 0
know, 0
Dennis, 0
governments 0
do 0
respond 0
to 0
pressure 0
from 0
powerful 0
media 0
interests. 0

It 0
rarely 0
happens 0
but 0
when 0
it 0
does 0
governments 0
do 0
change 0
their 0
tune. 0

There 0
has 0
been 0
no 0
pressure 0
from 0
media 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
Britain, 0
Australia 0
or 0
pretty 0
much 0
anywhere 0
except 0
in 0
programs 0
like 0
yours 0
outside 0
the 0
mainstream. 0

You 1
are 1
absolutely 1
right 1
in 0
that 0
the 0
responsibility 0
of 0
journalists 0
for 0
what 0
has 0
happened 0
to 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
and 0
what 0
might 0
happen 0
to 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
undeniable. 0

I 0
was 0
looking 0
this 0
morning 0
at 0
a 0
report 0
by 0
Media 0
Lens 0
in 0
Britain 0
describing 0
how 0
the 0
British 0
press 0
has 0
reported 0
on 0
Julian 0
Assange. 0

It 0
describes 0
the 1
tsunami 1
of 1
vindictive 1
personal 1
abuse 1
that 0
has 0
been 0
heaped 1
upon 1
Julian 0
from 0
well-known 0
journalists, 0
many 0
claiming 0
liberal 0
credentials. 0

The 0
Guardian, 0
which 1
used 1
to 1
consider 1
itself 1
the 1
most 1
enlightened 1
newspaper 1
in 1
the 1
country, 1
has 0
probably 0
been 0
the 0
worst. 0

The 0
frontal 0
attacks 0
have 0
been 0
coming 0
not 0
from 0
governments 0
but 0
from 0
journalists. 0

I 0
described 0
this 0
recently 0
as 0
“Vichy 1
journalism,” 1
a 0
term 0
which 0
now 0
fits 0
so 0
much 0
of 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media. 0

It 1
collaborates 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
that 1
the 1
Vichy 1
government 1
in 1
France 1
collaborated 1
with 1
the 1
Nazis. 1

what 0

the 0

the 0

I 0
have 0

a 0

for 0
a 0
very 0
long 0
time 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
always 0

the 0

and 0
one 0
of 0

Julian 0

and 0
WikiLeaks. 0

is 1
precisely 1
because 1

is 1
producing 1
the 1
kind 1
of 1
journalism 1
that 1
they 1

what 0

DB: 0

the 0

could 0
get 0
prosecuted 0
under 0
the 0

It 0
could 0
but 0
I 0
don’t 0
believe 0
it 0

be, 0
because 0
power 1
respects 1
power. 1

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
the 0

The 0
difference 0
with 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
outside 0
of 0
the 0
establishment 0
and 0
is 0
truly 0
independent. 0

DB: 0
What 0
would 0
be 0
your 0
strongest 0
plea 0
for 0
Julian 0
Assange? 0

JP: 0
It’s 0
very 0
simple. 0

This 0
is 0
about 0
justice. 0

In 0
a 0
famous 0
speech 0
given 0
in 0
the 0
1930’s 0
by 0
Parson 0
Martin 0
Niemoller, 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
first 0
the 0
Nazis 0
came 0
for 0
socialists, 0
but 0
he 0
didn’t 0
speak 0
up 0
because 0
that 0
didn’t 0
concern 0
him. 0

Then 0
they 0
came 0
for 0
trade 0
unionists, 0
but 0
he 0
didn’t 0
speak 0
up 0
because 0
that 0
didn’t 0
concern 0
him. 0

He 0
didn’t 0
speak 0
up 0
when 0
they 0
came 0
for 0
the 0
Jews 0
because 0
he 0
wasn’t 0
a 0
Jew. 0

And, 0
of 0
course, 0
finally 0
they 0
came 0
for 0
him. 0

That 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
precise 0
parallel, 0
but 0
if 1
Julian 1
Assange 1
is 1
allowed 1
to 1
literally 1
go 1
under, 1
it 1
represents 1
the 1
conquest 1
of 1
all 1
of 1
us. 1

It 0
means 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
kept 0
quiet. 0

Keeping 0
quiet 0
has 0
allowed 0
the 1
great 1
atrocities 1
of 1
histories 1
to 0
take 0
place. 0

If 1
Julian 1
is 1
allowed 1
to 1
be 1
spirited 1
away 1
to 1
some 1
super-max 1
hellhole, 1
it 1
will 1

What 0
is 0
Ebola? 0

Rare 0
but 0
deadly, 0
the 0
viral 0
disease 0
is 0
most 0
commonly 0
affecting 0
primates 0
and 0
humans. 0

Initial 0
symptoms 0
can 0
include 0
fever, 0
headache, 0
joint 0
and 0
muscle 0
aches, 0
weakness, 0
diarrhoea, 0
vomiting, 0
stomach 0
pain 0
lack 0
of 0
appetite 0
and 0
in 0
some 0
cases 0
internal 0
and 0
external 0
bleeding, 0
according 0
to 0
WHO. 0

Where 0
did 0
it 0
originate 0
from? 0

Ebola 0
virus 0
disease 0
(EVD) 0
was 0
first 0
discovered 0
in 0
1976 0
in 0
two 0
simultaneous 0
outbreaks. 0

One 0
in 0
what 0
is 0
now 0
Nzara 0
in 0
South 0
Sudan. 0

The 0
other 0
outbreak 0
in 0
Yambuku 0
in 0
Zaire 0
in 0
what 0
is 0
now 0
DR 0
Congo. 0

The 0
latter 0
occurred 0
in 0
a 0
village 0
near 0
the 0
Ebola 0
River, 0
from 0
which 0
the 0
disease 0
takes 0
its 0
name. 0

Why 0
is 0
it 0
so 0
dangerous? 0

The 0
average 0
Ebola 0
fatality 0
rate 0
is 0
about 0
50 0
percent. 0

But 0
the 0
rates 0
have 0
varied 0
from 0
25 0
percent 0
to 0
90 0
percent 0
in 0
recent 0
outbreaks. 0

There 0
is 0
as 0
of 0
yet 0
no 0
proven 0
cure 0
available 0
for 0
Ebola, 0
though 0
some 0
vaccines 0
are 0
being 0
tested. 0

Some 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
recovered 0
from 0
Ebola 0
have 0
developed 0
long-term 0
complications, 0
such 0
as 0
joint 0
and 0
vision 0
problems. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
known 0
why 0
some 0
people 0
recover 0
from 0
Ebola 0
while 0
most 0
succumb 0
to 0
the 0
disease. 0

Why 0
does 0
it 0
keep 0
coming 0
back? 0

The 0
disease 0
infects 0
humans 0
through 0
close 0
contact 0
with 0
infected 0
animals, 0
including 0
chimpanzees, 0
fruit 0
bats 0
and 0
forest 0
antelope. 0

In 0
Africa 0
where 0
most 0
outbreaks 0
happen, 0
particular 0
species 0
of 0
fruit 0
bats 0
are 0
considered 0
natural 0
hosts 0
for 0
the 0
Ebola 0
virus. 0

Infected 0
bats 0
are 0
believed 0
to 0
transmit 0
the 0
disease 0
to 0
humans, 0
or 0
indirectly 0
through 0
other 0
animals 0
that 0
are 0
hunted 0
for 0
their 0
meat. 0

The 0
family 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
victim 0
of 0
the 0
2014 0
outbreak, 0
a 0
two-year-old 0
child, 0
hunted 0
bats 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
believed 0
bushmeat 0
was 0
the 0
origin 0
of 0
the 0
outbreak. 0

An 0
estimated 0
five 0
million 0
tonnes 0
of 0
bushmeat 0
is 0
consumed 0
on 0
the 0
continent 0
every 0
year, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Centre 0
for 0
International 0
Forestry 0
Research. 0

The 0
virus 0
then 0
spreads 0
between 0
humans 0
by 0
direct 0
contact 0
with 0
infected 0
blood, 0
bodily 0
fluids 0
or 0
organs, 0
or 0
indirectly 0
through 0
contact 0
with 0
contaminated 0
environments. 0

Even 0
funerals 0
of 0
Ebola 1
victims 1
can 1
be 1
a 1
risk, 1
if 1
mourners 1
have 1
direct 1
contact 1
with 1
the 1
body 1
of 1
the 1
deceased. 1

just 0
three 0
days 0
after 0

invited 0

the 0

of 0

of 0

and 0
of 0

of 0
the 0

Schneider 0
told 0
LifesiteNews 0
in 0
an 0
exclusive 0
Jan. 0

interview. 0

Raising 0
a 0
Common 0
Voice 0

In 0
conversation 0
with 0
LifeSiteNews, 0
Schneider 0
said 0
greater 0
public 0
support 0
of 0
the 0
document 0
from 0
the 0
world’s 0
5,000 0
bishops 0
would 0
be 0
“a 0
stronger 0
voice 0
for 0
professing 0
the 0
constant 0
truths 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 1
it 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
beautiful 1
common 1
voice 1
defending 1
the 1
sanctity 1
and 1
the 1
indissolubility 1
of 1
marriage 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
a 1
real 1
neo-pagan 1
society 1
where 1
divorce 1
has 1
become 1
a 1
plague 1
and 1
where 1
sexual 1
depravity 1
is 1
increasingly 1
spreading.” 1

The 0
Profession 0
of 0
Immutable 0
Truths 0
about 0
Sacramental 0
Marriage 0
was 0
issued 0
by 0
three 0
Kazakh 0
Ordinaries, 0
including 0
Bishop 0
Schneider, 0
in 0
early 0
January. 0

In 0
the 0
document, 0
the 0
three 0
bishops 0
solemnly 0
professed 0
the 0
Church’s 0
received 0
teaching 0
and 0
discipline 0
regarding 0
sacramental 0
marriage 0
and 0
the 0
limited 0
conditions 0
(see 0
Familiaris 0
Consortio, 0
n. 0
84) 0
under 0
which 0
Catholics 0
who 0
are 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
may 0
receive 0
sacramental 0
absolution 0
and 0
Holy 0
Communion. 0

They 0
presented 0
their 0
profession 0
“before 0
God 0
who 0
will 0
judge 0
us,” 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
certain 0
pastoral 0
norms 0
issued 0
by 0
several 0
bishops’ 0
conferences 0
aimed 0
at 0
implementing 0
chapter 0
8 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
apostolic 0
exhortation 0
on 0
the 0
family, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

Some 1
of 1
these 1
norms, 1
Schneider 1
told 1
LifeSiteNews, 1
give 1
“implicit 1
approval” 1
of 1
divorce 1
and 1
of 1
sexual 1
activity 1
outside 1
a 1
valid 1
marriage. 1

Such 1
a 1
reading 1
is 1
causing 1
“rampant 1
confusion,” 1
will 1
spread 1
“a 1
plague 1
of 1
divorce” 1
in 1
the 1
Church, 1
and 1
is 1
“alien” 1
to 1
the 1
Church’s 1
entire 1
faith 1
and 1
Tradition, 1
the 0
three 0
bishops 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
profession. 0

“This 0
is 0
contrary 0
to 0
Divine 0
Revelation,” 0
Schneider 0
further 0
told 0
LifeSite, 0
adding 0
that 0
the 1
“beautiful 1
explanations” 1
that 1
are 1
being 1
presented 1
to 1
clergy 1
and 1
faithful 1
as 1
“discernment” 1
and 1
“pastoral 1
accompaniment,” 1
or 1
a 1
“change 1
of 1
paradigm” 1
and 1
“discovery 1
of 1
the 1
subjective 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
truth,” 1
when 1
translated 1
into 1
“common 1
sense 1
language,” 1
are 1
tantamount 1
to 1
an 1
allowance 1
to 1
sin. 1

“Our 0
conscience 0
as 0
bishops 0
calls 0
to 0
us 0
to 0
do 0
this,” 0
Schneider 0
explained. 0

“We 0
were 0
forced 0
by 0
our 0
conscience, 0
in 0
the 0
conscience 0
of 0
the 0
Successors 0
of 0
the 0
Apostles 0
and 0
colleagues 0
of 0
the 0
Pope.” 0

As 1
Successors 1
of 1
the 1
Apostles, 1
Schneider 1
said 1
they 1
“could 1
not 1
act 1
in 1
another 1
way.” 1

The 1
very 1
word 1
“secrecy” 0
is 0
repugnant 1
in 0
a 0
free 0
and 0
open 0
society; 0
and 0
we 0
are 0
as 0
a 0
people 0
inherently 0
and 0
historically 0
opposed 0
to 0
secret 0
societies, 0
to 0
secret 0
oaths 0
and 0
to 0
secret 0

We 0
decided 0
long 0

that 0
the 0
dangers 1
of 0
excessive 1
and 1
unwarranted 1
concealment 1
of 0
pertinent 0
facts 0
far 0
outweighed 0
the 0
dangers 0
which 0
are 0
cited 0
to 0
justify 0
it. 0

Even 0
today, 0
there 0
is 0
little 0
value 0
in 0
opposing 0
the 0
threat 0
of 0
a 0
closed 0
society 0
by 0
imitating 0
its 0
arbitrary 0
restrictions. 0

Even 1
today, 1
there 1
is 1
little 1
value 1
in 1
insuring 0
the 0
survival 0
of 0
our 1
nation 1
if 0
our 1
traditions 1
do 0
not 0
survive 0
with 0
it. 0

And 1
there 1
is 1
very 1
grave 1
danger 1
that 1
an 1
announced 1
need 1
for 1
increased 1
security 1
will 1
be 1
seized 1
upon 1
by 0
those 0
anxious 0

you 0
that 0

us 0
have 0
been 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0

initiative 0
for 0
a 0

it 0

approximately 0
three 0

One 0
thing 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
remember 0
here 0
is, 0
this 0
isn’t 0
about 0
democrats 0
vs 0
republicans, 0
it’s 0
about 0
the 0
elite 1
preserving 0
their 0
control, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
moment, 0
they 0
are 0
using 0
the 0
DNC 0
as 0
the 0
mouthpiece 0
for 0
that. 0

Thus, 0
anything 0
that 0
slandered 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
during 0
the 0
presidential 0
campaign, 0
for 0
example, 0
was 0
labelled 0
as 0
fake 0
news, 0
even 0
if 0
evidence 0
and 0
credible 0
sources 0
were 0
used. 0

This 0
is 0
because 0
she 0
is 0
part 0
of 0
that 0
elite. 1

This 0
is 0
cyber 0

its 0
finest, 0
where 0
authority 0

decide 0
for 0
the 0
people 0
what 0
is 0

and 0
what 0

not, 0
These 0

are 0
complemented 0
by 0
a 0

since 0

now 0
spearheading 0
their 0

What 0
is 0
Facebook’s 0
mission? 0

Well 0
at 0
the 0
moment 0
it 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
censoring 0
of 0
information. 0

Their 0
key 0
strategy 0
is 0
to 0
label 0
everything 0
as 0
fake 0
news 0
to 0
build 0
an 0
excuse 0
to 0
delete 0
Facebook 0
pages 0
that 0
are 0
dissenting 0
voices. 0

You 0
see, 0
independent 0
media, 0
like 0
CE, 0
became 0
extremely 0
popular, 0
receiving 0
many 0
millions 0
in 0
website 0
every 0
single 0
month, 0
that 0
traffic 0
came 0
from 0
Facebook. 0

Independent 0
media 0
outlets 0
were 0
greatly 0
surpassing 0
mainstream 0
media 0
in 0
their 0
power 0
and 0
voice. 0

This 0
is 0
something 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
outside 0
can’t 0
really 0
see 0
as 0
all 0
of 0
this 0
happens, 0
but 0
I 0
am 0
on 0
the 0
inside, 0
so 0
I 0
see 0
exactly 0
what’s 0
taking 0
place. 0

Eyes 0
were 0
shifting 0
away 0
from 0
the 0
small 0
group 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
have 0
controlled 0
media 0
since 0
media’s 0
inception. 0

Independent 0
media 0
brought 0
to 0
light 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
facts 0
that 0
threaten 0
the 0
agenda 0
of 0
the 0
global 1
elite, 1
like 0
intelligence 0
agency/government 0
connections 0
to 0
mainstream 0
media 0
for 0
example, 0
and 0
their 0
plans 0
in 0
the 0
middle 0
east 0
to 0
basically 0
invade, 0
take-over, 0
and 0
establish 0
a 0
government 0
that 0
suits 0
the 0
Deep 0
State’s 0
best 0
interests. 0

There 0
are 0
several 0
examples 0
from 0
all 0
fields 0
that 0
surround 0
human 0
life, 0
from 0
healthcare 0
to 0
politics, 0
and 0
it 0
all 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
controlled 0
by 0
one 0
massive 0
conglomerate 0
at 0
the 0
top. 0

We’ve 0
been 0
writing 0
about 0
this 0
for 0
nearly 0
a 0
decade 0
now. 0

The 0
Deep 0

Has 0
Power 0
Due 0

They 0
(global 1

continue 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
they 0
are 0
able 0
to 0
do 0
because 0
of 0
human 0
consciousness. 0

The 0
more 0
people 0
who 0
consider 0
this 0
a 0
“conspiracy 0
theory” 0
and 0
turn 0
their 0
heads 0
away, 0
the 0
easier 0
it 0
is 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
continue 0
and 0
have 0
power. 0

I 0
don’t 0
understand 0
how 0
so 0
much 0
information 0
can 0
come 0
to 0
light, 0
yet 0
when 0
it’s 0
deemed 0
a 0
“conspiracy” 0
theory” 0
within 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
everybody 0
simply 0
follows 0
the 0
rhetoric, 0
without 0
doing 0
any 0
investigation 0
or 0
research 0
for 0
themselves. 0

If 0
you 0
don’t 0
look 0
into 0
it, 0
don’t 0
share 0
an 0
opinion 0
on 0
it. 0

“Condemnation 0
without 0
investigation 0
is 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
ignorance.” 0
– 0

All 0
of 0
these 0
media 0
sources 0
were 0
operating 0
normally 0
until 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
became 0
president, 0
and 0
until 0
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
Obama, 0
Bush, 0
etc 0
were 0
outed 0
as 0
global 1
elite 1
puppets. 1

Heck, 0
the 0
Clinton’s 0
and 0
John 0
Podesta 0
have 0
even 0
referenced 0
Wikileaks 0
before 0
that 0
became 0
‘fake.’ 0
Despite 0
operating 0
with 0
credibility 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
decade 0
before 0
the 0
accusations. 0

What 0
does 0
the 0
media 0
operating 0
normally 0
mean? 0

Still 0
manipulating 0
the 0
public, 0
but 0
at 0
least 0
they 0
were 0
reporting 0
on 0
both 0
sides 0
as 0
a 0
whole. 0

Now, 0
it’s 0
quite 0
different. 0

Donald 0
Trump 0
is 0
extremely 1
vilified 1
not 0
because 0
he 0
allegedly 0
is/was 0
racist/sexist, 0
but 0
because 1
he 1
threatens 1
neoliberalism 1
and 1
neoconservatism, 1
the 1
American 1
empire, 1
one 0
that 0
continues 0
to 0
try 0
and 0
push 0
an 0
Orwellian 0
state 0
type 0
of 0
existence, 0
which 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
ramping 0
up 0
every 0
single 0
year. 0

Trump 0
was 0
not 0
supposed 0
to 0
win, 0
and 0
no 1
this 1
isn’t 1
about 1
democrats 1
vs 1
republicans 1
or 0
that 0
Trump 0
is 0
a 1
saviour. 1

The 0
Deep 0
State 0
responded 0
like 0
they 0
always 0
do 0
every 0
time 0
something 0
‘goes 0
wrong,’ 0
they 0
blamed 0
Russia, 0
as 0
well 0

media 0

Evolution 0
and 0
others. 0

The 0
Takeaway 0

Recognize 0
what’s 0
happening, 0
the 0
massive 0
censorship 0
of 0
information, 0
coupled 0
with 0
the 0
ridicule 0
or 0
finger 0
pointing, 0
or 0
even 0
arrest 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
choose 0
to 0
voice 0
an 0
opinion 0
in 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
rhetoric 0
that’s 0
constantly 0
spewed 1
by 0
mainstream 0
media, 0
which 0
in 0
turn 0
is 0
usually 0
believed 0
by 0
the 0
masses. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
independent 0
media 0
represents 0
a 0
shift 0
in 0
consciousness. 0

A 0
shift 0
in 0
our 0
perceptions, 0
thoughts, 0
feelings 0
and 0
general 0
self-awareness 0
about 0
our 0
own 0
planet 0
is 0
changing, 0
and 0
thus, 0
change 0
has 0
been 0
sprouted 0
in 0
multiple 0
different 0
areas, 0
including 0
political 0
corruption 0
and 0
the 0
stranglehold 0
it 0
has 0
over 0
our 0
world. 0

We 0
are 0
more 0
aware, 0
but 0
there 0
is 0
still 0
some 0
ways 0
to 0
go… 0

A 0
good 0
chunk 0
of 0
work 0
has 0
been 0
done. 0

A 0
massive 1
transformation 0
of 0
consciousness 0
has 0
taken 0
place 0
and 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
a 0
global 0
mass 0
is 0
growing 0
closer 0
to 0
a 0
critical 0
mass. 0

The 0
censorship 0
of 0
independent 0
media 0
is 0
irrelevant 0
in 0
a 0
sense, 0
because 0
the 0
shift 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
happen, 0
change 0
will 1
continue 1
to 1
happen, 1
and 0
information 0
that 0
the 0
deep 0
state 0
does 0
not 0
want 0
the 0
public 0
to 0
become 0
aware 0
of 0
will 0
keep 0
making 0
its 0
way 0
into 0
transparency. 0

Independent 0
media 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
share 0
information 0
because 1
of 1
a 1
lack 1
of 1
credible 1
information 1
and 1
plain 1
truth 1
within 1
the 1
mainstream. 1

People 0
are 0
hungry 0
for 0
it, 0
and 0
will 0
seek 0
it 0
out 0
themselves. 0

it 0
does 0
not 0

Larger 0
Than 0
The 0
Milky 0
Way 0

In 0
astronomy, 0
a 0
light-year 0
is 0
a 0
commonly 0
used 0
unit 0
to 0
measure 0
distance, 0
but 0
some 0
astronomers 0
prefer 0
to 0
use 0
a 0
unit 0
called 0
the 0
parsec. 0

When 0
referring 0
to 0
something 0
larger, 0
they 0
use 0
kiloparsecs, 0
which 0
are 0
equal 0
to 0
1,000 0
parsecs, 0
and 0
megaparsecs, 0
equal 0
to 0
one 0
million 0
parsecs. 0

The 0
Milky 0
Way 0
measures 0
about 0
100,000 0
light-years 0
or 0
30 0
kiloparsecs 0
across. 0

This 0
may 0
seem 0
large, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
rather 0
small 0
when 0
compared 0
to 0
other 0
galaxies. 0

The 0
Andromeda 0
Galaxy 0
has 0
an 0
approximate 0
diameter 0
of 0
220,000 0
light 0
years, 0
which 0
is 0
more 0
than 0
double 0
of 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
Milky 0
Way. 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
largest 0
galaxy 0
in 0
the 0
Local 0
Cluster. 0

If 0
it 0
were 0
bright 0
enough, 0
the 0
Andromeda 0
Galaxy 0
would 0
appear 0
larger 0
than 0
the 0
Moon 0
in 0
the 0
sky 0
(as 0
depicted 0
above), 0
even 0
with 0
it 0
being 0
much 0
farther 0

The 0
galaxy 0
is 0
9.5 0

away 0
from 0

whereas 0
the 0
Moon 0

only 0
384,400 0

of 0

allegations 0
says 0
he’s 0
certain 0

a 0
report 0
into 0
the 0
incident 0
was 0
made 0
public 0
this 0
week. 0

Noah 0
Lew 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
students 0
were 0
voted 0
off 0
the 0
Students’ 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
last 0
October 0
after 0
they 0
were 0
identified 0
as 0
having 0
pro-Israel 0
viewpoints. 0

They 0
were 0
since 0
reinstated. 0

A 0
report 0
made 0
public 0
this 0
week 0
by 0
Spencer 0
Boudreau 0
concluded 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
determine 0
if 0
students 0
who 0
organized 0
against 0
the 0
three 0
board 0
members 0
had 0
anti-Semitic 0
intentions. 0

Boudreau, 0
a 0
retired 0
professor 0
of 0
education 0
and 0
former 0
ombudsperson 0
for 0
students, 0
however, 0
said 0
he 0
understood 0
why 0
the 0
students 0
felt 0
they 0
were 0
targeted 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
Jewish. 0

After 0
criticism 0
from 0
several 0
Jewish 0
groups 0
both 0
on 0
and 0
off 0
campus, 0
Boudreau 0
issued 0
a 0
clarification 0
to 0
the 0
report, 0
saying 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
determine 0
if 0
the 0
vote 0
was 0
motivated 0
by 0
anti-Semitism, 0
but 0
he 0
acknowledged 0
there 0
were 0
“in 0
fact 0
anti-Semitic 0
effects 0
felt 0
by 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Jewish 0
community.” 0

Speaking 0
to 0
the 0
Montreal 0
Gazette 0
on 0
Friday, 0
Lew, 0
the 0
SSMU’s 0
vice-president 0
of 0
finance 0
for 0
the 0
Arts, 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
initially 0
upset 0
with 0
the 0
report, 0
but 0
felt 0
vindicated 0
by 0
Boudreau’s 0
clarification. 0

“I 0
thought 0
this 0
acknowledgement 0
was 0
very 0
important 0
and 0
I 0
really 0
did 0
appreciate 0
that 0
he 0
clarified 0
the 0
matter,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Jewish 0
groups 0
had 0
criticized 0
Boudreau’s 0
report, 0
saying 0
it 0
ignored 0
anti-Semitic 0
language 0
used 0
on 0
Facebook 0
by 0
a 0
group 0
called 0
Democratize 0
SSMU. 0

The 0
group 0
was 0
urging 0
students 0
to 0
vote 0
against 0
Lew, 0
and 0
two 0
other 0
board 0
members 0
who 0
were 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
pro-Israel, 0
alleging 1
“layers 1
of 1
corruption” 1
within 1
the 1
student 1
government 1
and 1
favouritism 1
in 1
appointing 1
board 1
members, 1
then 0
singled 0
out 0
three 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
board 0
“who 0
are 0
all 0
either 0
fellows 0
at 0
the 0
Canadian 0
Jewish 0
Political 0
Affairs 0
Committee, 0
an 0
organization 0
whose 0
explicit 0
mandate 0
is 0
to 0
promote 0
pro-Israel 0
discourse 0
in 0
Canadian 0
politics, 0
or 0
primary 0
organizers 0
for 0
the 0
anti-BDS 0
initiative 0
at 0
McGill.” 0

Boudreau 0
made 0
his 0
clarification 0
after 0
it 0
was 0
pointed 0
out 0
the 0
anti-Semitic 0
language 0
was 0
published 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
vote. 0

While 0
Democratize 0
SSMU 0
later 0
apologized 0
for 0
the 0
language 0
and 0
deleted 0
it 0
from 0
its 0
site, 0
the 0
damage 0
had 0
already 0
been 0
done, 0
Boudreau 0
concluded. 0

Lew 0
said 0
he 0
feels 0
vindicated 0
to 0
some 0
extent, 0
but 0
is 0
concerned 0
anti-Semitism 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
problem 0
within 0
student 0
government. 0

“There 0
have 0
been 0
some 0
steps 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
administration 0
and 0
the 0
student 0
body 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction, 0
but 0
it’s 0
certainly 0
not 0
over,” 0
he 0
said. 0

In 0
the 0
months 0
leading 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
vote, 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
other 0
anti-Semitic 0
incidents, 0
including 0
a 0
tweet 0
by 0
Igor 0
Sadikov, 0
an 0
elected 0
representative 0
of 0
students 0
in 0
McGill’s 0
faculty 0
of 0
arts, 0
saying: 0
“punch 1
a 1
zionist.” 1

Among 0
the 0
measures 0
taken 0
by 0
SSMU 0
after 0
the 0
October 0
vote 0
was 0
the 0
creation 0
of 0
a 0
committee 0
looking 0
into 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
anti-Semitism 0
within 0
the 0
student 0
government, 0
which 0
Lew 0
sits 0
on. 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
McGill 0
Principal 0
Suzanne 0
Fortier 0
said 0
the 0
University 0
wants 0
to 0
ensure 0
a 0
safe 0
space 0
for 0
all 0
students. 0

“I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
take 0
this 0
opportunity 0
to 0
make 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
there 1
is 1
absolutely 1
no 1
place 1
for 0
anti-Semitism 0
at 0
McGill 0
University 0
and 0
that, 0
as 0
principal 0
and 0
vice-chancellor, 0
I 0
will 0
remain 0
vigilant 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
all 0
members 0
of 0
our 0
community 0
feel 0
safe, 0
welcomed 0
and 0
respected 0
on 0
our 0
campuses.” 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
ordering 0
the 0
report, 0
Fortier 0
set 0
up 0
a 0
hotline 0
to 0
report 0
incidents 0
of 0
of 0
intolerance 0
and 0
a 0
task 0
force 0
to 0
investigate 0
incidents 0
of 0

freedom 0

the 0
co-chair 0
for 0

Affairs, 0
said 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
McGill 0
in 0
general 0
is 0
a 0
safe 0
space 0
for 0
Jewish 0
students. 0

However, 1
he 1
said 1
any 1
Jewish 1
students 1
thinking 1
of 1
being 1
involved 1
in 1
student 1
politics 1
or 1
activism 1
“will 1
have 1
encounters 1
that 1
are 1
profoundly 1
disturbing 1
and 1
unpleasant.” 1

He 1
said 1
McGill 1
is 1
not 1
alone 1
in 1
this 1
respect, 1
as 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
continent-wide 1
phenomenon 1
within 1
student 1
politics. 1

of 0
fancy 1
image-gathering 1
hardware 1
on 0
Earth 0

in 0

we’ve 0

countless 0
of 0
stunning 1

taken 0
from 0
here 0
on 0
Earth 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
nearby 0
planets 0
like 0
Mars, 0
Jupiter 0
and 0
Saturn. 0

The 0
pictures 0
are 0
often 0
gorgeously 1

eye 1
candy, 1
but 0
the 0
latest 0
batch 0
of 0
images 0
from 0
the 0
space 0
agency 0
is 0
remarkable 0
for 0
an 0
entirely 0
different 0
reason. 0

Captured 0
by 0
NASA’s 0
New 0
Horizons 0
spacecraft, 0
the 0
images 0
were 0
gathered 0
at 0
a 1

distance 1
from 1

than 1
any 1
in 1
the 1

So, 0
just 0
how 0
far 0
is 0
“the 0
farthest 0
ever”? 0

Right 0
around 0
3.79 0
billion 0
miles. 0

Yeah, 1
it’s 1
kind 1
of 1
crazy. 1

There 0
are 0
three 0
images 0
in 0
total, 0
each 0
focusing 0
on 0
a 0
different 0
distant 0
object. 0

The 0
subjects 0
include 0
the 0
‘Wishing 0
Well’ 0
star 0
cluster 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
two 0
large 0
objects 0
in 0
the 0
Kuiper 0
Belt 0
which 0
have 0
never 0
been 0
observed 0
from 0
such 0
a 0
distance 0
before. 0

“New 0

has 0
long 0
been 0
a 0
mission 0

— 0
first 0
to 0

“And 0

The 0

as 0
seen 0
above 0
(Kuiper 0
Belt 0
objects) 0
and 0
below 0
(Wishing 0

are 0
somewhat 0
grainy 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
most 0
detailed 0
we’ve 0
seen 0
from 0
NASA, 0
but 0
that 0
doesn’t 0
make 0
the 0
feat 0
any 0
less 0
remarkable. 0

New 0
Horizons 0
originally 0
launched 0
way 0
back 0
in 0
early 0
2006, 0
and 0
it 0
the 0
spacecraft 0
has 0
made 0
close 0
passes 0
of 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
planets 0
during 0
its 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
decade 0
of 0
cruising 0
through 0
our 0
Solar 0
System. 0

Its 0
primary 0
mission 0
was 0
set 0
to 0
last 0
roughly 0
10 0
years, 0
but 0
was 0
extended 0
once 0
it 0
became 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
spacecraft 0
was 0
healthy 0
enough 0
to 0
continue 0
sending 0
back 0
observations 0
for 0
a 0
while 0
longer. 0

Its 0
new 0
extended 0
mission 0
will 0
wrap 0
up 0
in 0
early 0
2021 0
after 0
it 0
performs 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
flybys 0
of 0
large 0
objects 0
in 0
the 0
Kuiper 0
Belt 0
that 0
scientists 0
want 0
to 0
learn 0
more 0
about. 0

However, 0
that 0
might 0
not 0
be 0
the 0
last 0
we 0
hear 0
from 0
New 0
Horizons, 0
as 0
its 0
power 0
source 0
could 0
continue 0
to 0
provide 0
life 0
into 0
2026 0
and 0
beyond. 0

If 0
it 0
makes 0
it 0
that 0
long, 0

at 0

in 0
Europe 0
in 0
standing 0
against 0
illegal 0
immigration 0
and 0
the 1

of 1

into 0
his 0

has 0
called 0
for 0
a 0
global 0
alliance 0
to 0
stand 0
against 0
the 0
migrant 1
invasion. 1

Viktor 0
Orban, 0
who 0
openly 0
professes 0
the 0
Reformed 0
faith 0
of 0
Christianity, 0
told 0
an 0
audience 0
at 0
the 0
Royal 0
Castle 0
in 0

“Christianity 1
is 1
Europe’s 1
last 1

He 0
continued 0
by 0
stating 0
that 0
mass 0
immigration, 0
especially 0
from 0
Africa, 0
“our 1
worst 1
nightmares 1
can 1
come 1
true. 1

The 1

falls 1
as 1
it 1
fails 1
to 1

Europe 1
being 1
overrun.” 1

Reuters 0
reports: 0

Hungarian 0
leader 0
Viktor 0
Orban 0
called 0
on 0
Sunday 0
for 0
a 0
global 0
alliance 0
against 0
migration 0
as 0
his 0
right-wing 0
populist 0
Fidesz 0
party 0
began 0
campaigning 0
for 0
an 0
April 0
8 0
election 0
in 0
which 0
it 0
is 0
expected 0
to 0
win 0
a 0
third 0
consecutive 0
landslide 0
victory. 0

Popular 0
at 0
home 0
but 0
increasingly 0
at 0
odds 0
politically 0
and 0
economically 0
with 0
mainstream 0
European 0
Union 0
peers, 0
Orban 0
has 0
thrived 0
on 0
external 0
controversy, 0
including 0
repeated 0
clashes 0
with 0
Brussels 0
and 0
lately 0
the 0
United 0
Nations. 0

Those 0
conflicts, 0
mostly 0
centered 0
on 0
migration 0
since 0
people 0
fleeing 0
war 0
and 0
poverty 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
and 0
Africa 0
flooded 0
into 0
Europe 0
in 0
2015, 0
have 0
intensified 0
as 0
the 0
elections 0
approach 0
and 0
Orban 0
poses 0
as 1
a 1
savior 1
of 1
Europe’s 1
Christian 1
nations. 1

One 0
thing 0
to 0
note 0
is 0
that 0
Christianity 1
is 1
not 1
Europe's 1
"last 1
hope," 1
it's 1
the 1
world's 1
"only 1
hope." 1

In 0
speaking 0
of 0
the 0
influx 0
of 0
Muslim 0
migrants 0
into 0
Europe, 0
Orban 0
sees 0
it 0
as 0
destroying 0
the 0
culture 0
of 0
Europe 0
and 0
referred 0
to 0
it 0
as 0
an 0
“immigrant 0
zone, 0
a 0
mixed 0
population 0
world 0
that 0
heads 0
in 0
a 0
direction 1
different 1
from 1
ours.” 1

Orban 0
then 0
called 0
out 0
the 1
traitors 1
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
Europe 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
push 0
Hungary 0
to 0
accept 0
Muslim 1
invaders. 1

“Absurd 0
as 0
it 0
may 0
sound 0
the 0
danger 0
we 0
face 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
West, 0
from 0
politicians 0
in 0
Brussels, 0
Berlin 0
and 0
Paris,” 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
crowd 0
to 0
applause. 0

“Of 0
course 0
we 0
will 0
fight, 0
and 0
use 0
ever 0
stronger 0
legal 0
tools. 0

The 0
first 0
is 0
our 0
‘Stop 1
Soros’ 1
law.” 0

Orban 0
has 0
seen 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
George 0
Soros 0
and 0
his 0
organizations 0
in 0
Hungary 0
and 0
has 0
openly 0
criticized 0
it 0
and 0
Soros, 0
calling 0
Soros 0
a 0
"public 1
enemy." 1

He 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
Soros 0
has 0
"ruined" 1
millions 0
of 0
lives 0
via 0
his 0
"mafia 1
network." 1

Reuters 0
adds: 0

Soros, 0
for 0
his 0
part, 0
compared 1
Orban 1
unfavorably 1
to 1
both 1
the 1
Nazis 1
and 1
the 1
Communists, 1
saying 0
his 0
rule 0
evoked 0
dark 0
tones 0
from 0
the 0
1930’s 0
— 0
when 0
Hungary 0
was 0
allied 0
with 0
Nazi 0
Germany 0
— 0
and 0
was 0
more 0
oppressive 0
than 0
Cold 0
War 0
Soviet 0
occupation. 0

Orban 0
has 0
tightened 0
the 0
screws 0
on 0
non-government 0
organizations, 0
particularly 0
ones 0
funded 0
by 0
Soros, 0
and 0
attempted 0
to 0
close 0
a 0
prominent 0
Soros-founded 0
university. 0

Attributing 0
to 0
Soros 0
a 0
recent 0
United 0
Nations 0
plan 0
on 0
creating 0
a 0
global 0
blueprint 0
to 0
handle 0
the 0
migration 0
crisis, 0
Orban 0
said 0
he 0
anticipated 0
that 0
powerful 0
allies 0
would 0
help 0
him 0
prevent 0
the 0
U.N. 0
from 0
greasing 0
the 0
wheels 0
of 0
migration. 0

“Soros 0
has 0
antagonized 0
not 0
only 0
us 0
but 0
also 0
England, 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
Israel 0
too,” 0
Orban 0
said. 0

“Everywhere 0
he 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
migration 0
accepted. 0

It 0
won’t 0
work. 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
alone 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
fight 0
together 0
… 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
succeed.” 0

“We 0
don’t 0
think 0
the 0
fight 0
is 0
hopeless, 0
on 0
the 0
contrary, 0
we 0
are 0
winning,” 0
Orban 0
said. 0

“The 0
V4 0
is 0
firm, 0
Croatia 0
has 0
come 0
around, 0
Austria 0
has 0
turned 0
in 0
the 0
patriotic 0
direction, 0
and 0
in 0
Bavaria 0
the 0
CSU 0
has 0
created 0
a 0
resistance.” 0

The 1
fight 1
isn't 1
hopeless 1
for 1
those 1
whose 1
hope 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
Lord 1
and 1
will 1
stay 1
the 1
course. 1

I 0
wish 0
Orban 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
support 0
him 0
success! 0

News: 0
‘Huge 0

Trump 0
‘Vindicated’ 1

A 0
panel 0
on 0
CNN’s 0
Situation 0
Room 0
With 0
Wolf 0
Blitzer 0
reacted 0
live 0
on 0
air 0
to 0
news 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
has 0
concluded 0
and 0
resulted 0
in 0
no 0
new 0
indictments 0
by 0
admitting 0
that 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
won 0
a 0
“huge 1
victory.” 1

“He’s 1
been 1
vindicated 1
by 0
them,” 0
Evan 0
Pérez 0
said 0
of 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report. 0

“And 0
then 0
he’s 0
now 0
vindicated, 1
exactly,” 0
Gloria 0
Borger 0
said. 0

“You 0
know–how 0
do 0
you 0
manage 0
that 0
politically? 0

I 0
mean, 0
we 0
obviously 0
can’t 0
jump 1
the 1
gun 1
here. 0

We 0
have 0
to 0
see 0
what 0
comes 0
out 0
from 0
Barr, 0
and 0
what’s 0
in 0
the 0
report. 0

But 0
if 0
I’m 0
at 0
Mar-A-Lago 0
with 0
the 0
president, 0
as 0
Pamela 0
has 0
been 0
reporting, 0
the 0
lawyers 0
are 0
… 0
that 0
I 0
would 0
be 0
very 0
happy,” 0
she 0
added. 0

Later, 0
a 0
panel 0
member 0
concluded 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
was 0
in 0
fact 0
a 0
“huge 0
victory” 0
for 0
President 0
Trump. 0

“A 0
couple 0
of 0
victories 0
here,” 0
CNN’s 0
Shimon 0
Prokupecz 0
said. 0

“The 0
president 0
did 0
not 0
have 0
to 0
sit 0
down 0
for 0
an 0
interview. 0

They 1
were 1
so 1
concerned 1
about 1
that, 1
because 1
he’d 1
get 1
caught 1
up 1
in 1
lies–and 1
there’d 1
be 1
perjury 1
traps. 1

Okay, 0
so 0
that’s 0
now 0
over. 0

No 0
more 0
people 0
being 0
indicted. 0

Sealed, 0
unsealed–no 0
more 0
indictments. 0

Mueller 0
is 0
done. 0

Huge 1
victory 1
for 0
the 0
president,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Special 0
counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
concluded 0
the 0
Russia 0
investigation 0
and 0
turned 0
over 0
his 0
report 0
to 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Willian 0
Barr 0
Friday 0

According 0
to 0

there 0
will 0

The 0

how 0
the 0
Jihadist 1
Psychopath 1
has, 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
the 0
Left, 0
successfully 0
built 0

following 1

Jamie 0

how 0

ban 0
on 0

apologizing 0

saying 0
that 0
the 0
block 0
was 0
a 0
“mistake”. 0

We 1
have 1
no 1
doubt, 1
of 1
course, 1
that 1
no 1
“mistake” 1
had 1
actually 1
occurred 1
in 1
this 1
matter 1

that 1
the 1

only 1
been 1
lifted 1

that 0

(for 0

this 1

is 1
crucial 1
to 1
amplify 1
now 1
more 1
than 1
ever, 1
seeing 0
that 0
Facebook, 0

all 0
of 0
leftist-run 1

is, 0
at 0
this 0

A 0
brief 0
recap 0
of 0
Jamie's 0
story: 0
on 0
Sept. 0
11, 0
the 0
17th 0
Anniversary 0
of 0
the 0
9/11 0
terror 0
strike, 0
Facebook's 1
Unholy 1
Alliance 1
masters 1
informed 0
Jamie 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
suspended 0
from 0
Facebook 0
for 0
30 0
days 0
due 0
to 0
his 0
posting 0
of 0
his 0
article, 0
9 0
Steps 0
to 0
Successfully 0
Counter 0
Jihad, 0
which 0
Facebook 0
informed 0
him 0
violated 0
their 0
"community 0
standards." 0

This 1
suggested, 1
of 1
course, 1
that 1
giving 1
advice 1
on 1
how 1
to 1
prevent 1
another 1
9/11, 1
and 1
all 1
other 1
Jihadist 1
attacks 1
against 1
America, 1
is 1
now 1
against 1
Facebook’s 1
‘community 1
standards’. 1

(Read 0
the 0
whole 0
story 0
HERE.) 0

Frontpage 0
and 0
Jamie 0
immediately 0
publicized 0
this 0
tyrannical 1
behavior 1
of 0
Facebook. 0

Then, 0
yesterday, 0
on 0
Sept. 0
13, 0
Facebook 0
notified 0
Jamie 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
made 0
a 0
mistake 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
lifting 0
his 0
block. 0

It 1
goes 1
without 1
saying 1
that 1
this 1
retraction 1
and 1
surrender 1
by 1
Facebook 1
occurred 1
only 1
because 1
of 1
the 1
wide 1
publicity 1
that 1
Jamie's 1
banning 1
had 1
received. 1

And 0
we 1
are 1
immensely 1
grateful 1
for 1
all 1
the 1
massive 1
support 1
that 1
was 1
given 1
to 1
us 1
across 1
the 1
Internet, 1
including 0
especially 0
from 0
Breitbart, 0
PJMedia, 0
WorldNetDaily 0
and 0
Thomas 0
Lifson 0
at 0
American 0
Thinker. 0

Leading 1
brave 1
conservative 1
figures 1
such 0
as 0
Michelle 0
Malkin 0
and 0
Laura 0
Loomer 0
also 0
stood 0
up 0
for 0
Jamie, 0
tweeting 0
about 0
his 0
ban 0
-- 0
and 0
to 0
them 0
we 0
send 0
our 0
heartfelt 0
appreciation. 0

Jamie 0
is, 0
of 0
course, 0
no 0
stranger 0
to 0
social 0
media 0
censorship 0
-- 0
especially 0
of 1
the 1
insane 1
variety. 1

The 0
Counter 0
Jihad 0
Coalition's 0
(CJC) 0
Facebook 0
page, 0
which 0
Jamie 0
helped 0
run 0
with 0
CJC 0
President 0
Steve 0
Amundson, 0
was 0
removed 0
a 0
few 0
years 0
ago 0
with 1
absolutely 1
no 1
explanation. 1

The 0
CJC 0
is 0
a 0
human 0
rights 0
and 0
pro-national 0
security 0
group 0
that 0
is 0
dedicated 0
to 0
protecting 0
America 0
and 0
the 0
West 0
from 0
Jihad 0
-- 0
and 0
Muslim 0
and 0
non-Muslim 0
people 0
from 0
Sharia 0
oppression. 0

The 0
question 0
remains: 0
why 1
would 1
Facebook 1
remove 1
such 1
a 1
page, 1
let 1
alone 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
fascistic 1
manner 1
-- 1
and 1
never 1
explain 1
why? 1

In 0
April 0
earlier 0
this 0
year, 0
Jamie 0
was 0
suspended 0
from 0
Facebook 0
for 0
posting 0
screenshots 0
of 0
a 0
Muslim's 0
threat 0
to 0
him 0
on 0
the 0
platform. 0

Then, 0
in 0
May, 0
his 0
Twitter 0
account 0
was 0
temporarily 0
suspended 0
and 0
he 0
was 0
forced 0
to 0
delete 0
tweets 0
he 0
posted 0
which 0
directly 0
quoted 0
Islamic 0
religious 0
texts. 0

His 0
account 0
was 0
suspended 0
for 0
violating 0
Twitter’s 0
rules 0
relating 0
to 0
“hateful 1
conduct.” 1
It 0
is 0
"hateful 1
conduct", 1
apparently, 0
to 0
reference 0
what 0
Islamic 0
texts 0
themselves 0
say. 0

Indeed, 0
Frontpage's 0
editor 0
had 0
simply 0
referred 0
to 0
Sahih 0
Bukhari’s 0
texts 0
discussing 0
Mohammed’s 0
marriage 0
to 0
Aisha 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
six 0
years 0
old 0
(7.62.88) 0
and 0
to 0
Qur'anic 0
Suras 0
that 0
mandate 0
the 0
Hijab 0
for 0
women 0
(24:31; 0
33:59) 0
and 0
sanction 0
sexual 0
slavery 0
(4:3; 0
33:50). 0

One 0
thing 0
we 0
know 0
for 0
sure 0
is 0
that, 0
despite 0
this 0
lifting 0
of 0
Jamie’s 0
ban, 0
Facebook 0
and 0
the 1
leftist 1
totalitarians 1
in 0
other 0
social 0
media 0
venues 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
culture 0
at 0
large 0
will 0
continue 0
their 1
unrelenting 1
effort 1
to 1
suffocate 1
dissent 1
and 1
conservative 1
voices. 1

On 0
Facebook, 0
many 0
brave 1
conservative 1
truth-tellers 1
continue 0
to 0
be 0
censored 0
in 0
myriad 0
ways; 0
these 0
individuals 0
include 0
Anni 0
Cyrus, 0
Bosch 0
Fawstin, 0
Mark 0
Lutchman 0
and, 0
of 0
course, 0
Diamond 0
& 0
Silk. 0

The 0
case 0
of 0
#WalkAway 0
leader 0
Brandon 0
Straka 0
is 0
especially 1
disturbing: 1
he 0
was 0
recently 0
banned 0
by 0
Facebook 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
announcing 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
be 0
interviewed 0
by 0
Alex 0
Jones. 0

Prager 0
U 0
has 0
had 0
its 0
videos 0
mysteriously 0
disappear 0
off 0
of 0
Facebook 0
and 0
then, 0
only 0
after 0
vociferous 1
protest, 1
re-appear. 0

Facebook 0
is, 0
of 0
course, 0
just 0
one 0
terrain 0
of 0
this 0
leftist 1
brownshirt-style 1
assault 1
on 1
free 1
speech. 1

Everyone 0
knows 0
by 0
now, 0
for 0
instance, 0
what 0
has 0
happened, 0
in 0
the 0
most 0
Orwellian 0
sense, 0
to 0
Alex 0
Jones 0
and 0
InfoWars 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
YouTube 0
and 0
Twitter. 0

Leading 0
scholar 0
of 0
Islam 0
and 0
JihadWatch.org 0
Director 0
Robert 0
Spencer, 0
meanwhile, 0
is 0
not 0
just 0
a 0
target 0
at 0
Facebook, 0
where 0
his 0
referrals 0
are 0
down 0
90% 0
from 0
what 0
they 0
once 0
were; 0
he 0
has 0
been 0
banned 0
by 0
Patreon 0
at 0
the 0
behest 0
of 0
MasterCard 0
-- 0
and 0

yet 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
his 0
lawyer’s 0
letter. 0

because 0
of 0
a 0
smear 1
by 0
the 1
Southern 1

(SPLC) 1
hate 1
machine. 1

Speaking 0
of 0
Mastercard, 0
the 0
David 0
Horowitz 0
Freedom 0
Center 0
just 0
recently 0
won 0
a 0
major 0
battle 0
with 0
the 0
credit 0
card, 0
defeating 0
well-financed 0
leftwing 0
groups 0
that 0
are 0
trying 1
to 1
run 1
the 1
Center 1
out 1
of 1
business 1
and 1
suffocate 1
free 1
speech 1
in 1
America. 1

The 0
Freedom 0
Center 0
emerged 0
victorious, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
leftist 1
hate 1
groups 1
such 0
as 0
the 0
SPLC 0
and 0
Color 0
of 0
Change.org 0
are 1
preparing 1
new 1
attacks 1
against 1
the 1
Freedom 1
Center 1
and 1
other 1
conservative 1
groups 1
and 1
individuals 1
24/7. 1

To 0
be 0
sure, 0
the 0
Left's 0
attacks 0
on 0
the 0
David 0
Horowitz 0
Freedom 0
Center 0
continue 0
unabated: 0
just 0
recently 0
a 0
hit 0
piece 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
smeared 1
a 1
stand-up 1
noble 1
gentleman 1
like 0
Florida 0
Gubernatorial 0
Candidate 0
Republican 0
Ron 0
DeSantis, 0
libeling 0
David 0
Horowitz 0
in 0
the 0
process. 0

The 0
article 0
stated 0
falsely 1
and 1
maliciously 1
that 0
Horowitz's 0
Restoration 0
Weekend, 0
that 0
DeSantis 0
had 0
attended, 0
was 0
somehow 0
“a 0
racially 1
charged 1
event” 1
-- 0
a 1
vicious 1
lie 1
that 0
Frontpage 0
has 0
exposed 0
and 0
for 0
which 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
is 0
still 0
to 0
apologize 0
and 0
issue 0
a 0
retraction. 0

(To 0
learn 0
why 0
David 0
Horowitz 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
central 0
targets 0
of 0
the 0
Left, 0
make 0
sure 0
to 0
watch 0
this 0
video). 0

Thus, 0
we 0
clearly 0
gauge 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
disgusting 1
and 1
venomous 1
level 1
to 0
which 0
the 0
Left 0
will 0
not 0
stoop 0
in 0
its 0
destructive 1
agenda. 1

Yes, 0
Frontpage 0
editor 0
Jamie 0
Glazov 0
has 0
had 0
his 0
ban 0
lifted 0
at 0
Facebook, 0
but 0
this 0
is 0
clearly 0
only 0
a 0
brief 0
reprieve 0
for 0
him 0
on 0
that 0
platform 0
-- 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
only, 0
obviously, 0
a 0
very 0
tiny 0
space 0
in 0
the 1
Stalinist 1
Left's 1
war 1
on 1
America 1
and 1
on 1
everything 1
on 1
which 1
it 1
stands. 1

At 1
this 1
dire 1
moment, 1
we 1
all 1
need 1
to 1
amplify 1
our 1
voices 1
in 1
defense 1
of 1
free 1
speech. 1

And 1
we 1
need 1
to 1
adamantly 1
defend 1
all 1
the 1
truth-tellers 1
at 1
the 1
very 1
moment 1
they 1
come 1
under 1
attack. 1

We 1
also 1
need 1
to 1
contact 1
our 1
representatives 1
and 1
to 1
call 1
for 1
a 1
Congressional 1
investigation 1
into 1
this 1
pernicious 1
assault 1
by 1
the 1
fascist 1
Left 1
on 1
our 1
liberties. 1

The 1
battle 1
for 1
America 1
-- 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
West 1
-- 1
is 1
on. 1

Why 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan 0
Is 0
Back 0
in 0

News 0

Louis 0
Farrakhan, 0
the 0
84-year-old 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam, 0
has 0
been 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
headlines 0
after 0
a 0
previously 0
unreleased 0
photo 0
of 0
him 0
with 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
was 0
published 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
gave 0
an 0
anti-Semitic 0
speech 0
at 0
his 0
organization’s 0
annual 0
convention 0
last 0
month. 0

The 0

Feb. 0
25 0
speech, 0
which 0
was 0
given 0
at 0
an 0
event 0
for 0
Saviour’s 0
Day, 0
a 0
religious 0
gathering 0
of 0
the 0
Nation, 0
ran 0
for 0
almost 0
three 0
hours. 0

During 0
it, 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
“powerful 0
Jews” 0
were 0
his 0
enemies, 0
and 0
that 0
Jews 1
were 1
“responsible 1
for 1
all 1
of 1
this 1
filth 1
and 1
degenerate 1
behavior 1
that 1
Hollywood 1
is 1
putting 1
out 1
turning 1
men 1
into 1
women 1

women 1
into 1
men,” 1
as 0
well 0
as 0
other 0
incendiary 0
remarks. 0

A 0

religious 0
fundamentalist 0
whose 0
group 0
has 0
been 0
condemned 0
by 0
the 0
Southern 0
Poverty 0
Law 0
Center, 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
is 0
fervently 1
opposed 0
to 0
the 0
legitimacy 0
of 0
the 0
state 0
of 0
Israel, 0
and 0
his 0
political 0
positions 0
regarding 0
the 0
country 0
frequently 0
spill 0
over 0
into 0
bigoted 0
remarks 0
about 0
Jews, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
many 0
public 0
officials 0
have 0
avoided 0
association 0
with 0
him. 0

Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
has 0
denied 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
anti-Semitic 0
and 0
has 0
even 0
said 0
that 0
his 0
father 0
may 0
have 0
been 0
Jewish. 0

Much 0

of 0
the 0
recent 0

on 0
Tamika 0

of 0

came 0
to 0

Their 0
reluctance 0
to 0

Mr. 0

led 0
to 0
criticism 0

this 0

What 0

is 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam? 0

The 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
is 0
a 0
political 0
and 0
religious 0
movement 0
that 0
was 0
started 0
by 0
W.D. 0

Fard 0
Muhammad 0
in 0
1931 0
and 0
continued 0
by 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad 0
in 0
1933. 0

It 0
first 0
became 0
prominent 0
after 0
a 0
man 0
named 0
Malcolm 0
Little 0
joined 0
the 0
organization. 0

Encouraged 0
by 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad, 0
he 0
changed 0
his 0
last 0
name 0
to 0
X 0
and 0
became 0

in 0
the 0
movement. 0

Edward 1

E. 1
Curtis 1
IV, 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
“Black 1
Muslim 1
Religion 1
in 1
the 1
Nation 1
of 1
Islam,” 1
said 1
that 1
while 1
estimates 1
ranged 1
wildly 1
about 1
how 1
many 1
bona 1
fide 1
members 1
belonged 1
to 1
the 1
Nation, 1
he 1
believes 1
that 1
there 1
were 1
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
members 1
in 1
the 1
1960s 1
and 1
early 1
1970s. 1

Who 0

is 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan? 0

Born 0
Louis 0
Eugene 0
Walcott 0
in 0
New 0
York 0
in 0
1933, 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
joined 0
the 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
in 0
the 0
mid-1950s 0
and 0
rose 0
quickly 0
within 0
the 0
organization, 0
becoming 0
close 0
to 0
Malcolm 0
X. 0

After 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
Malcolm 0
X 0
in 0
1965, 0
he 0
became 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
powerful 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Nation 0
and 0
its 0
chief 0
spokesman, 0
the 0
position 0
that 0
Malcolm 0
X 0
had 0
held. 0

The 0

Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
had 0
gained 0
followers 0
around 0
the 0
nation 0
in 0
the 0
1940s 0
and 0
’50s 0
by 0
providing 0
something 0
of 0
a 0
religious 0
answer 0
to 0
antiblack 0
racism. 0

It 0
was 0
not 0
widely 0
recognized 0
as 0
an 0
anti-Jewish 0
organization 0
during 0
its 0
early 0
years 0
(its 0
early 0
literature, 0
though, 0
focused 0
on 0
“the 1
white 1
man” 1
as 1
“the 1
white 1
devil”). 1

But 0
in 0
1967, 0
it 0
became 0
outspokenly 1
and 1
flagrantly 1
anti-Zionist, 1
in 0
an 0
expression 0
of 0
solidarity 0
with 0
Palestinians. 0

That 0
political 0
position 0
became 0
a 0
vehicle 0
for 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
to 0
express 0
his 0
anti-Semitism. 0

(Among 0
his 0
more 0
infamous 0
comments 0
is 0
his 1
1984 1
description 1
of 1
Adolf 1
Hitler 1
as 1
“a 1
very 1
great 1
man.”) 1

In 0

1975, 0
when 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad 0
died, 0
the 0
Nation 0
split 0
into 0
two 0
factions. 0

The 0
faction 0
reconstituted 0
under 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan 0
in 0
the 0
late 0
1970s 0
retained 0
the 0
original 0
name, 0
though 0
not 0
the 0
influence 0
or 0
support 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
when 0
its 0
leaders 0
were 0
Malcolm 0
X, 0
Muhammad 0
Ali 0
and 0
Elijah 0
Muhammad. 0

Mr. 0
Curtis 0
said 0
that 0
today 0
the 0
membership 0
could 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
thousands, 0
and 0
there 0
could 0
even 0
be 0
as 0
many 0
as 0
10,000 0
followers. 0

Mr. 0
Farrakhan, 0
whose 0
name, 0
the 0
Anti-Defamation 0
League 0
wrote 0
after 0
the 0
February 0
event, 0
is 0
“virtually 0
synonymous 0
with 0
anti-Semitism,” 0
then 0
drew 0
national 0
attention 0
in 0
1984, 0
when 0
he 0
exhorted 0
his 0
followers 0
to 0
support 0
Jesse 0
Jackson’s 0
bid 0
for 0
the 0
Democratic 0
presidential 0
nomination. 0

In 0

a 0
radio 0
address, 0
he 0
urged 0
listeners 0
to 0
“make 0
an 0
example” 0
of 0
a 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reporter 0
who 0
had 0
reported 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Jackson 0
had 0
used 0
anti-Semitic 0
terms 0
in 0
private. 0

Mr. 0
Jackson 0
repudiated 0
Mr. 0
Farrakhan, 0
but 0
the 0
minister’s 0
support 0
proved 0
troublesome 0
to 0
his 0
1988 0
campaign 0
as 0
well. 0

He 0

was 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
news 0
in 0
1995 0
when 0
he 0
organized 0
what 0
became 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
“Million 0
Man 0
March,” 0
a 0
political 0
and 0
religious 0
revival 0

A 0

the 0

to 0

“For 0

those 0

it 0
is 0
a 0

what 0

that 0
the 0

covering 1
up 1
a 1

about 1

During 0
an 0
appearance 0
with 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
on 0
Fox, 0
Rep. 0
Scott 0
Perry 0
(R-Pa.) 0
said 0
he’s 0
seen 0
credible 0
evidence 0
that 0
ISIS 0
was 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
devastating 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
shooting. 0

ISIS 0
terrorists, 0
he 0
said, 0
infiltrated 0
the 0
U.S. 0
via 0
the 0
southern 0
border 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
attack 0
blamed 0
on 0
alleged 0
lone 0
gunman 0
Stephen 0
Paddock. 0

“Recently 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
made 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
I 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
evidence, 0
credible 0
information 0
regarding 0
potential 0
terrorist 0
infiltration 0
through 0
the 0
southern 0
border 0
regarding 0
this 0
incident,” 0
Perry 0
said. 0

Perry 0
added 0
that 0
ISIS 0
warnings 0
of 0
a 0
forthcoming 0
attack 0
on 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
shooting 0
make 0
a 0
terror 0
link 0
even 0
more 0
likely. 0

“Well, 0
they 0
could 0
be–lets 0
face 0
it, 0
ISIS 0
twice 0
before 0
the 0
attack, 0
ISIS 0
warned 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
attack 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
in 0
June 0
and 0
August 0
after 0
the 0
attack 0
claimed 0
responsibility 0
four 0
times. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
investigative 0
services 0
are 0
telling 0
us 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
terrorist 0
connection–lone 0
gunman, 0
again, 0
something 1
is 1
not 1
adding 1
up,” 1
Perry 0
replied. 0

An 0
incredulous 0
Carlson 0
asked 0
fellow 0
guest 0
Catherine 0
Lombardo, 0
a 0
lawyer 0
representing 0
families 0
affected 0
by 0
the 0
tragedy, 0
about 0
the 0
law 0

investigation 0
into 0
the 0
shooting. 0

“The 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
metro 0
police 0
department 0
have 0
been 0
conducting 0
the 0
investigation, 0
” 0
she 0
said. 0

“We’ve 0
seen 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
terrorist 0
attack, 0
and 0
I 0
will 0
ask 0
with 0
all 0
due 0
respect, 0
congressman, 0
unless 0
have 0
you 0
specific 0
evidence 0
to 0
back 0
that 0
up, 0
it 0
seems 0
a 0
bit 0
irresponsible 0
to 0
make 0
that 0
allegation 0
so, 0
if 0
you 0
do, 0
or 0
make 0
that 0
assertion, 0
if 0
do 0
you 0
have 0
any 0
evidence 0
of 0
that, 0
I’m 0
asking 0
you 0
right 0
now 0
to 0
share 0
it 0
with 0
us 0
and 0
tell 0
us 0
what 0
that 0
is. 0

My 0
clients… 0
victims, 0
all 0
22,000 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
waiting 1
and 1
waiting 1
and 1
waiting 1
for 0
evidence.” 0

Perry 0
noted 0
that 0
all 1
Americans 1
are 0
still 0
lacking 0
all 0
the 0
evidence. 0

“We’ve 0
all 0
been 0
waiting, 0
and 0
I’m 0
waiting, 0
too. 0

Like 0
I 0
said, 0
nothing 0
adds 0
up, 0
but 0
I’m 0
just 0
telling 0
you, 0
I 0
have 0
received 0
what 0
I 0
feel 0
to 0
be 0
and 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0
credible 0
evidence 0
of 0
a 0
possible 0
terrorist 0
nexus, 0
and 0
we’re 0
gonna 0
have 0
to 0
wait… 0
until 0
the 0
situation 0
develops,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
lawmaker 0
said 0
he 0
wants 0
the 0
nation’s 0
counterterror 0
agencies 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
investigation. 0

“If 1
ISIS 1
warns 1
about 1
an 1
attack 1
and 1
then 1
an 1
attack 1
occurs 1
and 1
claims 1
responsibility 1
after 1
the 1
fact, 1
it 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
at 1
a 1
minimum, 1
they 1
should 1
have 1
some 1
portion 1
of 1
the 1
investigation 1
to 1
clearly 1
debunk 1
that 1
claim 1
and, 1
yet, 1
it 1
hasn’t 1
happened,” 1
he 1
said. 1

Another 0

similar 0
to 0
those 0
reported 0
by 0

in 0
Cuba. 0

The 0

worker 0
reported, 0
“subtle 0
and 0
vague, 0

abnormal, 0
sensations 0
of 0
sound 0

The 0

from 0

2017 0

April 0
of 0
2018, 0

the 0

It 0

in 0
a 0

When 0

the 0

being 0
heard 0
by 0

is 0
taking 0
the 0

seriously. 0

“If 0

they 0

very 0
little 0
additional 0
information 0
is 0
known 0
about 0
those 0
who 0
suffered 0
through 0
the 0
strange 0
ordeal. 0

After 0
months 0

investigations, 0
U.S. 0
officials 0
concluded 0
that 0
the 0

had 0
been 0
exposed 0
to 0
an 0
advanced 0
device 0
that 0
operated 0
outside 0

sound 0
and 0
had 0
been 0
deployed 0
either 0
inside 0

It 0
was 0
not 0
immediately 0
clear 0
if 0
the 0

was 0
a 0

in 0

Cunning 0
CIA 0

Whatever 0
else 0
might 0
be 0
said 0
about 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
President 0
Kennedy, 0
one 0
thing 0
is 0
for 0
sure: 0
The 1
cover-up 1
of 1
this 1
particular 1
U.S. 1
regime-change 1
operation 1
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
ingenious 1
and 1
cunning 1
plots 1
ever 1
designed. 1

This 0
shouldn’t 0
surprise 0
anyone, 0
given 0
that 0
practically 0
from 0
its 0
inception 0
in 0
1947 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
specializing 0
in 0
the 0
arts 0
of 0
assassination, 0
regime 0
change, 0
and 0
cover-up. 0

As 0
far 0
back 0
as 0
1953, 0
the 0
CIA 0
published 0
an 0
assassination 0
manual 0
that 0
the 1
CIA 1
succeeded 1
in 1
keeping 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
for 0
more 0
than 0
40 0
years. 0

It 0
came 0
to 0
light 0
in 0
1997 0
as 0
a 0
result 0
of 0
a 0
Freedom 0
of 0
Information 0
request. 0

That 0
was 0
around 0
the 0
time 0
that 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0
Review 0
Board, 0
which 0
was 0
overseeing 0
the 0
mandatory 0
release 0
of 0
JFK-related 0

records 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
other 0

agencies 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
kept 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
since 1
1963. 1

Today, 0
Americans 0
can 0
read 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
assassination 0
manual 0
online. 0

Titled 0
“Study 0
of 0
Assassination,” 0
the 0
manual 0
spells 0
out 0
various 0
ways 0
to 0
assassinate 0
people. 0

Here 0
is 0
what 0
the 0
manual 0
states 0
in 0
part 0
regarding 0
the 0
use 0
of 0
firearms: 0

Firearms 0
are 0
often 0
used 0
in 0
assassination, 0
often 0
very 0
ineffectively…. 0

Public 0
figures 0
or 0
guarded 0
officials 0
may 0
be 0
killed 0
with 0
great 0
reliability 0
and 0
some 0
safety 0
if 0
a 0
firing 0
point 0
can 0
be 0
established 0
prior 0
to 0
an 0
official 0
occasion. 0

The 0
propaganda 0
value 0
of 0
this 0
system 0
may 0
be 0
very 0
high. 0

Time 0
to 0
buy 0
old 0
US 0
gold 0
coins 0

The 0
manual 0
also 0
makes 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
studying 0
ways 0
to 0
assassinate 0
people 0
without 0
being 0
detected. 0

Note 0
the 0
following 0
excerpt: 0

For 0
secret 0
assassination, 0
either 0
simple 0
or 0
chase, 0
the 0
contrived 0
accident 0
is 0
the 0
most 0
effective 0
technique. 0

When 0
successfully 0
executed, 0
it 0
causes 0
little 0
excitement 0
and 0
is 0
only 0
casually 0
investigated. 0

It 0
would 0
be 0
safe 0
to 0
assume 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
continued 0
developing 0
and 0
expanding 0
on 0
the 0
assassination 0
principles 0
enunciated 0
in 0
that 0
early 0
assassination 0
manual. 0

That’s 0
what 0
we 0
would 0
expect 0
from 0
an 0
agency 0
whose 0
specialties 0
included 0
assassination. 0

We 0
can 0
also 0
assume 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
continued 0
to 0
refine 0
the 0
ways 0
to 0
avoid 0
detection 0
when 0
assassinating 0
someone. 0

The 0
CIA 0
published 0
that 0
secret 0
assassination 0
manual 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
preparations 0
for 0
a 0
U.S. 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
in 0
Guatemala, 0
one 0
that 0
was 0
designed 0
to 0
violently 1
remove 1
the 0
nation’s 0
democratically 0
elected 0
socialist 0
president, 0
Jacobo 0
Arbenz, 0
from 0
office 0
and 0
replace 0
him 0
with 0
an 0
unelected, 1
right-wing, 1
pro-U.S. 1
military 1
general. 1

As 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Guatemala 0
regime-change 0
operation, 0
the 0
CIA 0
prepared 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
Guatemalan 0
officials 0
to 0
be 0
assassinated. 0

While 0
the 0
CIA 0
has 0
never 0
revealed 0
the 0
names 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
it 0
targeted 0
for 0
assassination, 0
there 0
is 0
little 0
doubt 0
that 0
Arbenz, 0
the 0
president, 0
was 0
at 0
the 0
top 0
of 0
the 0
list. 0

There 0
is 0
something 0
important 0
to 0
note: 0
Neither 0
Arbenz 0
nor 0
any 0
other 0
Guatemalan 0
official 0
had 0
ever 0
attacked 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
or 0
even 0
threatened 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

So, 0
why 0
were 0
they 0
targeted 0
for 0
assassination? 0

Because 0
Arbenz 0
had 0
reached 0
out 0
to 0
the 0
Russians 0
and 0
Cubans 0
in 0
a 0
spirit 0
of 0
peace 0
and 0
friendship, 0
just 0
as 0
John 0
Kennedy 0
would 0
do 0
ten 0
years 0
later. 0

That’s 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
targeted 0
Guatemala 0
for 0
regime 0
change 0
and 0
why 0
it 0
targeted 0
Arbenz 0
and 0
other 0
Guatemalan 0
officials 0
for 0
assassination. 0

Although 0
Arbenz 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
escape 0
the 0
country, 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
was 0
a 1
total 1
success, 1
with 0
Arbenz 0
being 0
replaced 0
by 0
the 0
pro-U.S. 0
Gen. 0
Carlos 0
Castillo 0
Armas, 0
who 0
proceeded 0
to 0
instigate 0
a 1
reign 1
of 1
terror 1
across 0
Guatemala. 0

The 1
Guatemalan 1
operation 1
was 1
brilliant 1
and 1
ingenious. 1

The 0
CIA 0
officials 0
were 0
secretly 0
honored 0
for 0
protecting 0
“national 0
security” 0
by 0
removing 0
President 0
Arbenz 0
from 0
office 0
and 0
replacing 0
him 0
with 0
a 0
pro-U.S. 0
military 0
general. 0

Tracy 0
Barnes, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
officials 0
responsible 0
for 0
the 0
operation, 0
was 0
awarded 0
the 0
Distinguished 0
Intelligence 0
Medal, 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
second-highest 0
medal. 0

The 1
CIA’s 1
cover-up 1
in 1
the 1
JFK 1
assassination 1
was 1
even 1
more 1
brilliant 1
and 1
ingenious. 1

The 0
doctors 0
at 0
Parkland 0
Hospital 0
stated 0
that 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
a 0
big 0
exit-sized 0
wound 0
in 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
his 0
head, 0
which 0
implied 0
a 0
shot 0
having 0
been 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front. 0

At 0
a 0
press 0
conference 0
immediately 0
after 0
the 0
president 0
died, 0
two 0
treating 0
physicians 0
stated 0
that 0
the 0
other 0
wound 0
— 0
the 0
one 0
in 0
the 0
front 0
of 0
Kennedy’s 0
neck 0
— 0
was 0
an 0
entry 0
wound, 0
which 0
implied 0
that 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
been 0
hit 0
by 0
another 0
shot 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front. 0

This 0
necessarily 0
meant 0
that 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
been 0
shot 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
not 0
the 0
rear, 0
where 0
accused 0
assassin 0
Lee 0
Harvey 0
Oswald 0
was 0
situated. 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
something 0
important: 0
After 0
he 0
was 0
arrested, 0
Oswald 0
claimed 0
his 0
innocence. 0

But 0
he 0
also 0
went 0
a 0
step 0
further. 0

He 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
framed 0
for 0
the 0
crime. 0

The 0
obvious 0
question 0
arises: 0
Why 0
frame 0
an 0
innocent 0
man 0
who 0
is 0
situated 0
in 0
the 0
rear 0
by 0
killing 0
the 0
president 0
with 0
shots 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front? 0

Wouldn’t 0
it 0
be 0
more 0
logical 0
to 0
either 0
have 0
the 0
shots 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
rear, 0
where 0
Oswald 0
was, 0
or, 0
alternatively, 0
place 0
Oswald 0
in 0
the 0
front, 0
where 0
the 0
shots 0
were 0
fired? 0

That’s 0
where 0
the 1
brilliance, 1
ingenuity, 1
and 1
cunningness 1
of 1
the 1
cover-up 1
come 0
into 0
play. 0

If 0
Oswald 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
rear 0
and 0
since 0
shots 0
are 0
fired 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
that 0
could 0
mean 0
only 0
one 0
thing: 0
that 0
Oswald 0
had 0
confederates 0
firing 0
from 0
the 0
front. 0

Who 0
would 0
those 0
confederates 0
be? 0

There 1
could 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
answer: 1
communists. 1

Soviet 1
and 1
Cuban 1
communists, 1
to 1
be 1
more 1
specific. 1

How 0
would 0
we 0
know 0
this? 0

That’s 0
where 0
Oswald’s 0
trip 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City 0
right 0
before 0
the 0
assassination 0
comes 0
into 0
play. 0

Oswald 0
traveled 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City 0
where 0
he 0
purportedly 0
visited 0
the 0
Soviet 0
and 0
Cuban 0
embassies 0
and 0
where 0
he 0
supposedly 0
met 0
with 0
a 0
premier 0
assassin 0
for 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union. 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
the 0
Cold 0
War 0
between 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
Cuban 0
Missile 0
Crisis, 0
which 0
brought 0
the 0
world 0
to 0
the 0
brink 0
of 0
nuclear 0
war, 0
had 0
taken 0
place 0
the 0
previous 0
year. 0

So, 0
President 0
Kennedy 0
has 0
been 0
assassinated. 0

Oswald 0
is 0
immediately 0
arrested. 0

He 0
has 0
confederates 0
firing 0
from 0
the 0
front, 0
who 1
almost 1
certainly 1
are 1
Soviet 1
and 1
Cuban 1
communists, 1
especially 0
since 0
Oswald 0
has 0
supposedly 0
just 0
recently 0
visited 0
the 0
Soviet 0
and 0
Cuban 0
embassies 0
in 0
Mexico 0
City. 0

What 0
does 0
all 0
that 0
mean? 0

An 0
assassination 0
of 0
the 0
president 0
by 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union 0
and 0
Cuba 0
is 0
obviously 0
an 0
act 0
of 0
war. 0

That 0
means 0
nuclear 0
war 0
is 0
about 0
to 0
break 0
out 0
because 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
that 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
sit 0
idly 0
by 0
when 0
the 1
Reds 1
have 0
just 0
assassinated 0
America’s 0
president. 0

Except 0
for 0
one 0
thing: 0
The 1
communist 1
part 1
and 1
the 1
nuclear-war 1
part 1
were 1
concocted. 1

That 1
was 1
all 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
plan. 1

That 0
was 0
the 1
ingenious 1
way 1
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
get 0
the 0
investigation 0
into 0
the 0
assassination 0
squelched 0
just 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
Oswald 0
was 0
murdered. 0

In 0
the 0
early 0
days 0
of 0
the 0
Warren 0
Commission, 0
commission 0
chairman 0
Earl 0
Warren 0
called 0
a 0
top-secret 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
commission. 0

Its 0
purpose 0
was 0
to 0
discuss 0
information 0
that 0
Warren 0
had 0
received 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
actually 0
a 0
U.S. 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
or 0
an 0
informant 0
for 0
the 0
FBI 0
or 0
both. 0

How 0
did 0
Warren 0
resolve 0
this 0
troubling 0
issue? 0

He 0
simply 0
asked 0
the 0
heads 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
FBI 0
whether 0
it 0
was 0
true. 0

They 0
said 0
no. 0

That 0
was 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
matter. 0

The 0
issue 0
was 0
so 0
sensitive 0
that 0
Warren 0
ordered 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
commission 0
to 1
never 1
reveal 1
the 1
meeting 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

He 0
ordered 0
all 0
notes 0
and 0
other 0
written 0
references 0
to 0
be 0
destroyed. 0

He 0
also 0
ordered 0
the 0
court 0
reporter 0
to 0
destroy 0
her 0
notes 0
of 0
the 0
meeting. 0

Unbeknownst 0
to 0
him, 0
the 0
court 0
reporter 0
inadvertently 0
kept 0
a 0
recording 0
of 0
the 0
meeting 0
that 0
ultimately 0
came 0
to 0
light. 0

This 0
troubling 0
issue 0

out 0
that 0
among 0
the 0
long-secret 0

that 0

was 0
a 0

BELIN: 0
Well, 0
now, 0
the 0
final 0
area 0
of 0
my 0
interrogation 0
relates 0
to 0
charges 0
that 0
the 0
CIA 0
was 0
in 0
some 0
way 0
conspiratorially 0
involved 0
with 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0

That’s 0
where 0
the 0
transcript 0
ends 0
according 0
to 0
few 0
secret 0
records 0
of 0
the 0
CIA 0
that 0
were 0
recently 0
released 0
by 0
the 0

Shapira 0
points 0
out, 0
“Several 0
news 0
organizations, 0
including 0
The 0
Washington 0

seized 0
on 0

secrecy 0
about 0

Shapira 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
Helms’ 0
full 0
deposition 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
arena 0
since 0
1994. 0

(The 0
year 0
1994 0
was 0
during 0
the 0
tenure 0
of 0
the 0
Assassination 0
Records 0

Board, 0
the 0
agency 0
charged 0
with 0
securing 0
the 0
mandated 0
release 0
of 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
records 0
from 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
other 0

agencies. 0

The 0
ARRB 0

been 0

had 0
learned 0
of 0
the 0
official 0
secrecy 0
after 0

Oliver 0
Stone’s 0
movie 0
JFK, 0
which 0
posited 0
that 0
the 0
JFK 0
assassination 0
was 0
a 0
U.S. 0

operation, 0
no 0
different 0
in 0

from 0
the 0
one 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
carried 0
out 0
in 0
Guatemala 0
nine 0
years 0
before.) 0

Shapira 0
then 0
proceeds 0
to 0
provide 0
the 0
answer 0
that 0
Helms 0
gave, 0
which, 0
as 0
he 0
points 0
out, 0
has 0
been 0
public: 0

HELMS: 0
Mr. 0
Belin, 0
this 0
question, 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
you 0
may 0
recall 0
this, 0
was 0
raised 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
and 0
the 0
Agency 0
was 0
never 0
able 0
to 0
find 0
any 0
evidence 0
whatsoever, 0
and 0
we 0
really 0
searched 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
any 0
contact 0
with 0
Lee 0
Harvey 0
Oswald. 0

As 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
FBI 0
was 0
concerned, 0
my 0
recollection 0
is 0
not 0
all 0
that 0
precise. 0

I 0
believe 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Hoover 0
testified 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
not 0
been 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
theirs 0
either. 0

He 0
was 0
certainly 0
not 0
an 0
agent 0
of 0
the 0
CIA. 0

He 0
was 0
certainly 0
never 0
used 0
by 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Whether 0
any 0
CIA 0
officer 0
ever 0
talked 0
to 0
him 0
any 0
place 0
or 0
not 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
but 0
I 0
certainly 0
felt 0
quite 0
comfortable 0
— 0
I 0
believe 0
Mr. 0
[John] 0
McCone 0
[a 0
previous 0
CIA 0
director] 0
was 0
asked 0
to 0
testify 0
before 0
the 0
Commission 0
on 0
this 0
point. 0

I 0
believe 0
he 0
was 0
asked 0
to 0
testify. 0

It 0
was 0
a 0
hot 0
item 0
anyway 0
at 0
the 0
time. 0

And 0
my 0
recollection 0
is 0
that 0
I 0
informed 0
Mr. 0
McCone 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
find 0
no 0
evidence 0
that 0
Oswald 0
had 0
any 0
connection 0
with 0
the 0
CIA. 0

Shapira 0
ends 0
his 0
article 0
by 0
suggesting 0
that 0
commentators 1
should 1
do 1
more 1
complete 1
research, 1
maybe 1
even 1
use 1
Google, 1
before 1
they 1
jump 1
to 1
conclusions. 1

But 1
Shapira 1
would 1
be 1
wise 1
to 1
follow 1
his 1
own 1
advice 1
because 1
he 1
himself 1
is 1
guilty 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
accuses 1
others 1
of. 1

That’s 0
because 0
he 1
failed 1
to 1
conclude 1
his 1
article 1
with 1
one 1
great 1
big 1
important 1
point 1
about 1
former 1
CIA 1
Director 1
Richard 1
Helms. 1

What 0
is 0
that 0
great 1
big 1
important 1
point 1
that 0
Shapira, 0
who, 1
according 1
to 1
his 1
tagline 1
on 1
his 1
article, 1
“enjoys 1
writing 1
about 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
served 1
in 1
the 1
military 1
and 1
intelligence 1
communities,” 1
left 0
out 0
of 0
his 0
article? 0

Perjury. 0

He 0
left 0
out 0
that 0
former 0
CIA 0
Director 0
Richard 0
Helms 0
was 0
a 1
perjurer. 1

A 1
liar. 1

A 0
CIA 0
official 0
who 0
would 0
tell 0
falsehoods, 0
even 0
under 0
oath, 0
whenever 0
he 0
felt 0
that 0
“national 0
security” 0
required 0
it. 0

Shapira 1
failed 1
to 1
note 1
that 1
Helms 1
was 1
convicted 1
in 1
a 1
federal 1
district 1
court 1
of 1
lying 1
to 1
Congress 1
under 1
oath 1
about 0
another 0
CIA 0
regime-change 0
operation 0
ten 0
years 0
after 0
the 0
Kennedy 0
assassination 0
in 0
Chile. 0

Interesting 0
enough, 0
in 0
the 0
Chile 0
regime-change 0
operation, 0
the 0
CIA 0
and 0
the 0
Pentagon 0
were 0
telling 0
their 0
counterparts 0
in 0
the 0
Chilean 0
national-security 0
establishment 0
that 0
they 0
had 0
a 0
moral 0
duty 0
to 0
violate 0
their 0
nation’s 0
constitution 0
and 0
violently 1
remove 1
their 0
nation’s 0
democratically 0
elected 0
president, 0
Salvador 0
Allende, 0
from 0
office. 0

The 0
reason? 0

Allende 0
was 0
reaching 0
out 0
to 0
the 0
Russians 0
and 0
Cubans 0
in 0
a 0
spirit 0
of 0
peace 0
and 0
friendship, 0
just 0
as 0
Arbenz 0
had 0
done 0
and 0
just 0
as 0
Kennedy 0
had 0
done. 0

Thus, 0
given 0
that 0
Helms 0
was 0
an 0
admitted 1
perjurer 1
and 1
convicted 1
liar, 1
what 0
value 0
does 0
his 0
denial 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
an 0
intelligence 0
agent 0
have? 0

It 0
has 0
no 0
value 0
at 0
all. 0

And 0
Shapira, 0
who 1
“enjoys 1
writing 1
about 1
people 1
who 1
have 1
served 1
in 1
the 1
military 1
and 1
intelligence 1
communities” 1
had 0
an 0
ethical 0
duty 0
to 0
point 0
out 0
Helms’ 0
proclivity 0
for 0
lying 0
in 0
his 0
article. 0

The 0
circumstantial 0
evidence 0
overwhelmingly 1
establishes 0
that 0
Oswald 0
was 0
working 0
for 0
U.S. 0
intelligence. 0

How 0
often 0
have 0
you 0
ever 0
heard 0
of 0
a 0
U.S. 0
Marine 0
communist? 0

If 0
Oswald 0
was 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist, 0
why 0
would 0
he 0
have 0
joined 0
the 0
Marines 0
in 0
the 0
1950s, 0
given 0
that 0
the 0
Marines 0
hated 0
communists 0
and 0
had 0
just 0
helped 0
kill 0
millions 0
of 0
them 0
in 0
the 0
Korean 0
War? 0

Why 0
would 0
a 0
genuine 0
communist 0
want 0
to 0
join 0
an 0
organization 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
could 0
be 0
ordered, 0
on 0
a 0
moment’s 0
notice, 0
to 0
return 0
to 0
Korea 0
or 0
be 0
sent 0
to 0
Vietnam, 0
Laos, 0
China, 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union, 0
or 0
Europe 0
to 0
kill 0
communists? 0

Don’t 0
forget: 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
height 0
of 0
the 0
Cold 0
War! 0

After 0
Oswald 0
supposedly 0
tried 0
to 0
“defect” 0
to 0
the 0
Soviet 0
Union 0
and 0
promised 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
Russians 0
all 0
the 0
secrets 0
he 0
learned 0
about 0
in 0
the 0
military, 0
why 0
would 0
U.S. 0
officials 0
agree 0
to 0
let 0
him 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
country, 0
and 0
with 0
a 0
communist 1
wife? 1

Why 0
wouldn’t 0
they 0
indict 0
him 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
haul 0
him 0
before 0
a 0
federal 0
grand 0
jury 0
to 0
testify 0
as 0
to 0
what 0
secrets 0
he 0
gave 0
the 0
Russians? 0

Why 0
wouldn’t 0
they 0
harass, 1
abuse, 1
humiliate, 1
persecute, 1
or 1
prosecute 1
him, 1
like 0
they 0
did 0
to 0
Martin 0
Luther 0
King, 0
Dalton 0
Trumbo, 0
John 0
Walker 0
Lindh, 0
Chelsea 0
Manning, 0
Edward 0
Snowden, 0
and 0
other 0
people 0
they 0
have 0
deemed 0
to 0
be 0
communists 0
or 0
traitors? 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
that 0
Oswald 0
could 0
learn 0
fluent 0
Russian 0
while 0
serving 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
military 0
without 0
having 0
U.S. 0
military 0
tutors 0
teaching 0
him? 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
that 0
a 0
veteran 0
who 0
embarrasses 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Marine 0
Corps 0
by 0
openly 0
proselytizing 0
for 0
communism 0
in 0
New 0
Orleans 0
is 0
able 0
to 0
saunter 0
across 0
the 0
Cold 0
War 0
stage 0
of 0
history, 0
not 0
long 0
after 0
the 0
McCarthy 0
hearings, 0
without 1
nary 1
a 1
care 1
in 1
the 1
world? 1

The 1
answer: 1
Helms 1
lied. 1

There 1
is 1
no 1
reasonable 1
doubt 1
that 1
Oswald 1
was 1
a 1
U.S. 1
intelligence 1
agent, 1
one 0
who 0
was 0
ordered 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
Mexico 0
City 0
to 0
set 0
the 0
framework 0
for 0
his 0
frame-up. 0

But 0
things 0
obviously 0
went 0
dreadfully 1
wrong 1
in 0
Mexico 0
City, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
the 0
CIA 0
had 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
that 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
post-assassination 0
investigation. 0

Not 0
surprisingly, 0
the 0
CIA’s 0
Mexico 0
City 0
operations 0
regarding 0
Oswald 0
are 0
among 0
the 0
98 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
records 0
that 0
Trump 0
and 0
the 0
CIA 0
have 0
chosen 0
to 0
continue 0
keeping 1
secret 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people, 1
on 0
grounds 0
of 0
“national 0
security” 0
of 0
course. 0

Thus, 0
when 1
Oswald 1
was 1
claiming 1
that 1
he 1
was 1
being 1
framed, 1
there 1
could 1
be 1
only 1
one 1
entity 1
that 1
he 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
thinking 1
about: 1
the 1
CIA, 1
the 0
agency 0
whose 0
officials, 0
as 0
former 0
Washington 0
Post 0
investigative 0
reporter 0
Jefferson 0
Morley 0
has 0
documented, 0
were 1
secretly 1
monitoring 1
his 1
activities 1
in 1
the 1
weeks 1
leading 1
up 1
to 1
the 1
assassination, 1
no 1
doubt 1
to 1
ensure 1
that 1
Oswald 1
had 1
not 1
figured 1
out 1
what 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
happen 1
to 1
him. 1

We 0
can 0
assume 0
that 0
any 0
frame-up 0
by 0
the 0
CIA 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
good. 0

The 0
operation 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
carefully 0
planned 0
and 0
executed. 0

But 1
no 1
plan 1
is 1
perfect. 1

Things 0
are 0
inevitably 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
wrong. 0

The 0
pieces 0
aren’t 0
going 0
to 0
fit 0
together 0
perfectly. 0

The 0
Mexico 0
City 0
operation 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
of 0
that. 0

That’s 1
why 1
the 1
CIA 1
has 1
to 1
continue 1
keeping 1
those 1
records 1
secret. 1

But 0
here’s 0
another 0
example, 0
a 0
small 0
but 0
important 0
one: 0
Recall 0
that 0
Oswald 0
supposedly 0
hid 0
the 0
rifle 0
before 0
he 0
headed 0
down 0
the 0
steps 0
from 0
the 0
sixth 0
floor 0
of 0
the 0
school 0
book 0
depository. 0

Ask 0
yourself: 0
If 0
someone 0
has 0
just 0
assassinated 0
the 0
president 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States, 0
is 0
he 0
really 0
going 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
hide 0
the 0
rifle? 0

What 0
good 0
would 0
that 0
do? 0

Wouldn’t 0
officials 0
conduct 0
a 0
thorough 0
search 0
of 0
the 0
area? 0

Wouldn’t 0
an 0
assassin 0
instead 0
simply 0
leave 0
the 0
rifle 0
there 0
and 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
there 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
he 0
could? 0

Then 1
why 1
the 1
hidden 1
rifle? 1

Because 1
it’s 1
consistent 1
with 1
a 1
frame-up. 1

The 0
framers 0
had 0
to 0
hide 0
the 0
rifle 0
in 0
advance 0
in 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
no 0

& 0

Secret 0

would 0
see 0
it 0
during 0
the 0
morning 0
of 0
the 0
assassination, 0
which 0
took 0
place 0
after 0
noon. 0

No 0
matter 0
how 0
good 0
a 0
frame-up 0
was, 0
the 0
CIA 0
knew 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
detected 0
with 0
an 0
aggressive 0
investigation. 0

That’s 0
where 0
ingenuity 1
and 1
cunning 1
come 1
into 1
play. 1

They 0
had 0
to 0
figure 0
out 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
the 0
investigation 0
so 0
that 0
the 0
frame-up 0
would 0
remain 0
intact. 0

That’s 1
why 1
they 1
had 1
shots 1
fired 1
from 1
the 1
front 1
and 1
placed 1
Oswald 1
in 1
the 1
rear. 1

The 0
idea 0
was 0
that 0
since 0
an 0
investigation 0
would 0
lead 0
to 0
Oswald’s 0
supposed 0
communist 0
confederates 0
in 0
the 0
front, 0
which 0
in 0
turn 0
would 0
lead 0
to 0
nuclear 0
war, 0
the 0
investigation 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
shut 0
down 0
immediately, 0
especially 0
since 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
CIA 0
itself 0
that 0
had 0
started 0
the 0
assassination 0
game 0
by 0
repeatedly 0
attempting, 0
in 0
partnership 0
with 0
the 0
Mafia, 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Castro. 0

It 0
was 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
brilliant 1
and 1
cunning 1
ruses 1
in 1
history. 1

They 0
get 0
the 0
body 0
out 0
of 0
Parkland 0
by 0
force, 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
Texas 0
law, 0
and 0
put 0
it 0
in 0
the 0
hands 0

“uses 0

to 0
Mr. 1

the 0
increase, 0
while 0
provocative, 0
does 0
not 0
violate 0
its 0
commitments 0
under 0

to 0

from 0
a 0
top 0
Iranian 0
official 0
that 0
the 0
activities 1
could 1
be 1
quickly 1

The 0

alive 0
despite 0

Salehi, 0
said 0
Tehran 0
is 0
prepared 0
to 0
dramatically 1
increase 0
its 0
capacity 0

that 0
the 0
work 0
so 0

Wednesday. 0

Under 0

given 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
reclaim 0

in 0
state 0
assets 0
and 0
bank 0

The 0

by 0
U.S. 0

to 0
convert 0

Iran 0

elevated 0
the 0

On 0
the 0
day 0
the 0
nuclear 0

was 0
implemented 0
in 0
2015, 0
Tehran 0
had 0
some 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
worth 0
of 0
assets 0
at 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
in 0
Muscat, 0
Oman, 0
according 0
to 0
Senate 0
investigators, 0
who 0
said 0
Tehran 0
moved 0
quickly 0
to 0
request 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
dollar. 0

On 0
Tehran’s 0
request, 0
Bank 0
Muscat 0
contacted 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Treasury 0
Department’s 0
office 0
of 0
foreign 0
assets 0
control. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
report: 0
“Muscat 0
sought 0
to 0
convert 0
$5.7 0
billion 0
in 0
Omai 0
rials 0
into 0
euros. 0

[But] 0
because 0
the 0
rial 0
is 0
pegged 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
dollar, 0
the 0
most 0
efficient 0
conversion 0
was 0
with 0
an 0
intermediary 0
step 0
through 0
a 0
U.S. 0
bank 0
using 0
U.S. 0

Obama 0
Treasury 0
Secretary 0
Jack 0
Lew 0
told 0
the 0
Senate 0
Foreign 0
Relations 0
Committee 0
in 0
July 0
2015 0
that 0
Iran 0
would 0
“continue 0
to 0
be 0
denied 0

to 0
the 0
[U.S.] 0
financial 0
and 0
commercial 0
market” 0
under 0
the 0
proposed 0
accord, 0
but 0
the 0
Treasury 0
office 0
went 0
ahead 0
with 0
attempts 0
to 0
quietly 0
allow 0
the 0
currency 0
transaction 0
sought 0
by 0
Iran. 0

“On 0
February 0
24, 0
2016, 0
OFAC 0
issued 0
a 0
specific 0

to 0
Bank 0

authorizing 0

assets 0
worth 0
roughly 0
$5.7 0

to 0
flow 0
through 0
the 0
U.S. 0

according 0
to 0
the 0
Senate 0
report, 0
which 0
claims 0
the 0
move 0
was 0
made 0
“even 0
though 0
U.S. 0
sanctions 0
prohibited 0
it.” 0

Even 0
as 0
office 0
of 0

officials 0
directly 0
“encouraged 0
two 0
U.S. 0
correspondent 0
banks 0
to 0
convert 0
the 0
funds,” 0
the 0
Treasury 0
Department 0
continued 0
to 0
deny 0
it 0
was 0
working 0
to 0
facilitate 0
the 0
currency 0
transaction, 0
said 0
the 0
report, 0
which 0
cites 0
a 0
2016 0
letter 0
from 0
the 0

to 0
Sen. 0
Marco 0
Rubio, 0
Florida 0
Republican, 0

Sen. 0
Mark 0
Kirk, 0
Illinois 0
Republican, 0
that 0
contended 0
the 0
Obama 0
“administration 0
has 0
not 0

not 0
planning 0
to 0

the 0
U.S. 0

The 0
catch, 0
according 0
to 0
Senate 0
investigators, 0
was 0
that 0
neither 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0

that 0
“the 0

Iran.” 0

“Despite 0
claims 0
both 0
before 0
and 0
after 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal 0
was 0
completed 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0

remain 0

the 0
Obama 0

issued 0
a 0

allowing 0
Iran 0
to 0
convert 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
assets 0
using 0
the 0
U.S. 0
financial 0
system,” 0
Mr. 0
Portman 0
said. 0

“The 0
only 0
reason 0
this 0
transaction 0
wasn’t 0
executed 0
was 0
because 0
two 0
U.S. 0
banks 0
refused, 0
even 0
though 0
the 0

asked 0
them 0
to 0
help 0

Such 0

added, 0
“are 0

the 0

despite 0
the 0

of 0
statesmen 0
like 0
George 0

to 0

that 0
had 0
lost 0
a 0
third 0

and 0

We 0
moved 0
NATO 0
into 0
Eastern 0

the 0

onto 0

doorstep. 0

We 0

the 0

Nixon 0

moved 0

much 0
new 0
information, 0
and 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
meeting, 0
they 0
refused 0
to 0
take 0
questions. 0

Since 0
that 0
day, 0
the 0
only 0
person 0
who 0
has 0
shed 0
more 0
light 0
on 0
the 0
investigation 0
is 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
security 0
guard 0
Jesus 0
Campos, 0
who 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
the 0
leg 0
while 0
approaching 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
room. 0

His 0
platform 0
to 0
share 0
that 0
information? 0

“The 0
Ellen 0
DeGeneres 0
Show,” 0
which 0
aired 0
last 0
week. 0

He 0
hasn’t 0
made 0
himself 0
available 0
to 0
the 0
media 0
since. 0

“It 0
doesn’t 0
matter,” 0
FBI 0
spokeswoman 0
Sandra 0
Breault 0
told 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Review-Journal 0
on 0
Thursday, 0
when 0
asked 0
why 0
there 0
had 0
been 0
no 0
significant 0
updates 0
in 0
two 0
weeks. 0

“It’s 0
an 0
ongoing 0
investigation, 0
and 0
unless 0
there’s 0
something 0
to 0
report, 0
there 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
a 0
briefing.” 0
Calls 0
to 0
the 0
national 0
FBI 0
office 0
were 0
forwarded 0
back 0
to 0
Breault 0
at 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
office. 0

At 0
least 0
twice 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Review-Journal 0
has 0
asked 0
to 0
speak 0
with 0
Sheriff 0
Joe 0
Lombardo 0
about 0
the 0
shooting 0
investigation. 0

Both 0
times, 0
reporters 0
were 0
told 0
by 0
Carla 0
Alston, 0
the 0
Police 0
Department’s 0
director 0
of 0
communications, 0
that 0
the 0
sheriff 0
“will 0
not 0
be 0
conducting 0
interviews.” 0
“As 0
he 0
has 0
stated 0
previously, 0
the 0
case 0
is 0
still 0
ongoing” 0
she 0
said 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
Thursday. 0

“Another 0
media 0
briefing 0
will 0
be 0
held 0
when 0
we 0
have 0
new 0
and 0
accurate 0
information.” 0
When 0
asked 0
when 0
that 0
briefing 0
would 0
be, 0
Alston 0
guessed 0
it 0
could 0
occur 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
two 0
weeks. 0

The 0
Review-Journal 0
also 0
specifically 0
asked 0
about 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
50,000 0
hours 0
of 0
overtime 0
that 0
Metro 0
officers 0
have 0
logged 0
since 0
Oct. 0
1 0
on 0
work 0
directly 0
related 0
to 0
the 0
shooting 0
investigation. 0

“Investigators 0
have 0
made 0
progress 0
on 0
investigative 0
leads 0
and 0
in 0
mapping 0
out 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
life 0
for 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
years 0
— 0
and 0
they’re 0
still 0
not 0
done,” 0
Alston 0
said. 0

“We 0
still 0
have 0
officers 0
dedicated 0
to 0
this 0
case 0
24/7.” 0
She 0
agreed 0
that 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
public 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
know 0
more, 0
“but 0
they 0
have 0
a 0
right 0
to 0
accurate 0
information 0
and 0
not 0
the 0
speculation 0
… 0
that 0
has 0
filled 0
so 0
many 0
news 0
stories 0
the 0
past 0
month.” 0
Nearly 0
a 0
month 0
after 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting, 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
motive 0
remains 0
a 0
mystery. 0

More 0
straightforward 0
questions 0
also 0
remain 0
unanswered, 0
including 0
whether 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
of 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
— 0
where 0
the 0
gunman 0
was 0
staying 0
— 0
has 0
surveillance 0
cameras, 0
and 0
what 0
exactly 0
investigators 0
collected 0
in 0
the 0
gunman’s 0
hotel 0
room 0
and 0
homes. 0

Authorities 0
also 0
have 0
not 0
said 0
how 0
long 0
the 0
gunman 0
had 0
a 0
“do 0
not 0
disturb” 0
sign 0
on 0
his 0
hotel 0
door, 0
and 0
whether 0
hotel 0
staff 0
saw 0
something 0
suspicious 0
in 0
his 0
room 0
but 0
failed 0
to 0
report 0
it. 0

Though 0
authorities 0
have 0
described 0
the 0
investigation 0
as 0
a 0
team 0
effort, 0
they 0
have 0
not 0
explained 0
what 0
role 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
police, 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
the 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Alcohol, 0

"It 0

October 0

The 0

who 0

unnamed 0
by 0
the 0

on 0

in 0
the 0

footage 0
reveals 0
“helicopter 0
hovering 0
overhead” 0
at 0
time 0
of 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Massacre, 0
FBI 0
never 0
asked 0
for 0
tape, 0
after 0
an 0
excerpt 0
of 0
the 0
footage 0
aired 0
on 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
Tonight. 0

At 0
10:16 0
p.m., 0
two 0
men 0
drag 0
a 0
“fallen 0
victim” 0
across 0
the 0
parking 0
lot. 0

The 0
men 0
position 0
the 0
victim 0
behind 0
a 0
Ford 0
pickup 0
truck, 0
presumably 0
to 0
shield 0
themselves 0
and 0
the 0
victim 0
from 0
taking 0
any 0
further 0
incoming 0
rounds 0
as 0
they 0
attempted 0
to 0
give 0
the 0
victim 0
medical 0
assistance. 0

“Later 0
at 0
ten-twenty-four 0
p.m., 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
places 0
his 0
shirt 0
across 0
the 0
victim’s 0
face 0
and 0
then 0
at 0
ten-thirty-two 0
a 0
man 0
places 0
what 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
blanket 0
or 0
towel 0
over 0
the 0
body 0
after 0
they 0
had 0
given 0
up 0
hope,” 0
Tucker 0
Carlson 0
said. 0

“Police 0
only 0
arrive 0
in 0
this 0
area 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
around 0
ten-forty-five 0
p.m. 0
when 0
the 0
body 0
is 0
still 0
there.” 0
The 0
victim’s 0
body 0
was 0
eventually 0
was 0
loaded 0
into 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
a 0
Ford 0
Raptor 0
pickup 0
truck 0
at 0
11:50 0
p.m. 0
and 0
taken 0
away. 0

Astonishingly, 0
between 0
the 0
times 0
of 0
10:13 0
p.m. 0
and 0
10:16 0
p.m. 0
a 0
good 0
amount 0
of 0
debris 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
being 0
pushed 0
downward 0
and 0
sideways 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
the 0
camera 0
which 0
Carlson 0
claims 0
is 0
from 0
a 0
“helicopter 0
hovering 0
overhead.” 0
A 0
quick 0
review 0
of 0
flight 0
records 0
during 0
that 0
time 0
reveals 0
that 0
a 0
squadron 0
of 0
EC-130 0
Eurocopters 0
departed 0
from 0
Maverick 0
Leasing 0
LLC 0
at 0
10:12 0
p.m., 0
several 0
of 0
which 0
appear 0
to 0
have 0
overflown 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
where 0
the 0
victim 0
and 0
debris 0
were 0
seen. 0

However, 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
the 0
choppers 0
and 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
several 0
of 0
them 0
overflew 0
the 0
parking 0
lot 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
debris 0
being 0
kicked 0
up 0
from 0
by 0
a 0
heavy 0
downdraft, 0
prop 0
wash, 0
possibly 0
from 0
a 0
helicopter 0
hovering 0
in 0
place 0
much 0
closer. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
downdraft 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
constant 0
from 0
10:13-10:16 0
p.m. 0
and 0
not 0
intermittent 0
as 0
if 0
several 0
choppers 0
had 0
just 0
passed 0
overhead. 0

According 0
to 0
Carlson, 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
the 0
tape 0
maintains 0
that 0
law 1
enforcement 1
investigators 1
have 1
never 1
asked 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
footage. 1

A 0

two 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
over 0

Two 0
days 0
later, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
official 0
story, 0
on 0
August 0
4, 0
1962, 0
the 0
NSA 0
reported 0
that 0
a 0
second 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident 0
occurred 0
and 0
US 0
ships 0
were 0
attacked 0
once 0
again. 0

The 0
next 0
day, 0
without 0
question, 0
on 0
August 0
5, 0
1964, 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reported 0
“President 0
Johnson 0
has 0
ordered 0
retaliatory 0
action 0
against 0
gunboats 0
and 0
‘certain 0
supporting 0
facilities 0
in 0
North 0
Vietnam’ 0
after 0
renewed 0
attacks 0
against 0
American 0
destroyers 0
in 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin.” 0
Additional 0
outlets, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
echoed 0
this 0
claim. 0

The 0
outcome 0
of 0
these 0
two 0
incidents 0
was 0
the 0
passage 0
by 0
Congress 0
of 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
Resolution, 0
which 0
granted 0
then-President 0
Lyndon 0
B. 0
Johnson 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
assist 0
any 0
Southeast 0
Asian 0
country 0
whose 0
government 0
was 0
considered 0
to 0
be 0
jeopardized 0
by 0
“communist 0
aggression.” 0
The 0
resolution 0
served 0
as 0
Johnson’s 0
legal 0
justification 0
for 0
deploying 0
U.S. 0
conventional 0
forces 0
and 0
the 0
commencement 0
of 0
open 0
warfare 0
against 0
North 0
Vietnam. 0

As 0
a 0
result, 0
58,177 0
Americans 1
would 0
lose 0
their 0
lives. 0

Additionally, 0
over 0
one 0
million 0
North 0
and 0
South 0
Vietnamese, 0
including 0
627,000 0
civilians 0
would 0
be 0
slaughtered. 1

But 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
true. 0

At 1
all. 1

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident, 0
as 0
it 0
became 0
known, 0
turned 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
fictitious 0
creation 0
courtesy 0
of 0
the 0
government 0
to 0
escalate 0
war 0
in 0
Vietnam 0
— 0
leading 0
to 0
the 0
deaths 0
of 0
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 0
U.S. 0
troops 0
and 0
millions 0
of 0
Vietnamese, 0
fomenting 0
the 0
largest 0
anti-war 0
movement 0
in 0
American 0
history, 0
and 0
tarnishing 0
the 0
reputation 0
of 0
a 0
nation 0
once 0
considered 0
at 0
least 0
somewhat 0
noble 0
in 0
the 0
eyes 0
of 0
the 0
world. 0

The 0
truth 0
of 0
the 0
matter 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
Maddox 0
was 0
engaged 0
in 0
an 0
aggressive 1
intelligence 0
gathering 0
operation 0
working 0
hand 0
in 0
hand 0
in 0
coordinated 0
attacks 0
on 0
North 0
Vietnam 0
by 0
the 0
South 0
Vietnamese 0
navy 0
and 0
the 0
Laotian 0
air 0
force. 0

When 0
the 0
government 0
announced 0
that 0
it 0
had 0
been 0
the 0
victim 0
of 0
an 0
unprovoked 0
attack—this 0
was 0
a 0
lie. 0

In 0
the 0
2003 0
documentary 0
The 0
Fog 0
of 0
War 0
, 0
the 0
former 0
United 0
States 0
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense 0
Robert 0
S. 0
McNamara 0
admitted 0
that 0
the 0
August 0
4 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
attack 0
never 0
happened. 0

In 0
1995, 0
McNamara 0
met 0
with 0
former 0
Vietnam 0
People’s 0
Army 0
General 0
Võ 0
Nguyên 0
Giáp 0
to 0
ask 0
what 0
happened 0
on 0
August 0
4, 0
1964 0
in 0
the 0
second 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
Incident. 0

“Absolutely 0
nothing”, 0
Giáp 0
replied. 0

Giáp 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
attack 0
had 0
been 0
imaginary. 0

In 0
2010, 0
more 0
than 0
1,100 0
transcripts 0
from 0
the 0
Vietnam 0
era 0
were 0
released, 0
proving 0
Congress 0
and 0
officials 0
raised 0
serious 0
doubts 0
about 0
the 0
information 0
fed 0
to 0
them 0
by 0
the 0
Pentagon 0
and 0
White 0
House. 0

But 0
while 0
this 0
internal 0
grumbling 0
took 0
place, 0
mainstream 0
media 0
dutifully 0
reported 0
official 0
statements 0
as 0
if 0
the 0
veracity 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
disputed. 0

Tom 0
Wells, 0
author 0
of 0
the 0
exhaustive 0
exposé 0
“The 0
War 0
Within: 0
America’s 0
Battle 0
Over 0
Vietnam 0
,” 0
explained 0
the 0
media 0
egregiously 0
erred 0
in 0
“almost 0
exclusive 0
reliance 0
on 0
U.S. 0
government 0
officials 0
as 0
sources 0
of 0
information” 0
and 0
“reluctance 0
to 0
question 0
official 0
pronouncements 0
on 0
‘national 0
security 0
issues.’” 0

If 0
due 0
diligence 0
had 0
been 0
performed, 0
and 0
reporters 0
had 0
raised 0
appropriate 0
doubts 0
about 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
false 0
flag, 0
it’s 0
arguable 0
whether 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
contentious 0
war 0
would 0
have 0
lasted 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
it 0
did 0
and 0
over 0
a 0
million 0
lives 0
would’ve 0
been 0
saved. 0

Now, 0
retired 0
military 0
officials—who 0
pay 0
attention 0
to 0
history—are 0
even 0
warning 0
about 0
more 0
staged 0
events 0
to 0
pull 0
us 0
into 0
war. 0

“I 0
think 0
the 0
president 0
needs 0
to 0
watch 0
carefully 0
for 0
the 0
potential 0
for 0
something 0
like 0
the 0
Gulf 0
of 0
Tonkin 0
incident,” 0
Col. 0
Macgregor 0
said. 0

“Many 0
of 0
your 0
viewers 0
may 0
not 0
remember 0
that 0
it 0
never 0
happened 0
and 0
we 0
could 0
very 0
well 0
be 0
treated 0
to 0
something 0
like 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
Gulf. 0

We 0
should 0
watch 0
for 0
that, 0

this 0

an 0

comments 0
on 0

AP 0
reports 0
that 0
U.S. 0
immigration 0
officials 0
say 0
they 0
will 0
deport 0
the 0

man 0
found 0
not 0

As 0
we 0
detailed 0
earlier, 0
in 0
a 0
verdict 0
that 0
has 0
shocked 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
Bay 0
Area 0
(and 0
across 0
America), 0
a 0
jury 0
of 0
six 0
men 0
and 0
six 0
women 0
in 0
sanctuary 0
city 0
San 0
Francisco 0
found 0
illegal 0
immigrant 0
(and 0
five-time 0
deportee) 0
Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
not 0
guilty 0
in 0
the 0
death 0
of 0
Kate 0
Steinle. 0

Mr. 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
been 0
homeless 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
and 0
had 0
multiple 0
felony 0
convictions 0
and 0
five 0
prior 0
deportations 0
to 0
Mexico. 0

He 0
had 0
been 0
set 0
free 0
from 0
jail 0
only 0
months 0
before 0
the 0
shooting, 0
in 0
defiance 0
of 0
requests 0
by 0
federal 0
immigration 0
authorities, 0
who 0
had 0
asked 0
that 0
he 0
be 0
held 0
longer 0
so 0
he 0
could 0
be 0
deported 0
again. 0

The 1
backlash 1
to 1
his 1
release 1
into 1
the 1
community 1
crescendoed 1
when 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
invoked 0
Ms. 0
Steinle’s 0
killing 0
as 0
he 0
campaigned 0
for 0
president. 0

As 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reports, 0
Ms. 0
Steinle’s 0
death 0
in 0
July 0
2015 0
fed 0
into 0
a 0
fierce 1
debate 1
over 0
whether 0
immigrants 0
without 0
legal 0
status 0
should 0
be 0
deported 0
more 0
aggressively, 0
and 0
over 0
the 0
role 0
local 0
law 0
enforcement 0
should 0
play. 0

Ms. 0
Steinle, 0
known 0
as 0
Kate, 0
a 0
32-year-old 0
medical 0
equipment 0
saleswoman, 0
was 0
walking 0
along 0
Pier 0
14 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
struck 0
by 0
a 0
bullet 0
and 0
collapsed 0
into 0
her 0
father’s 0
arms. 0

Mr. 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
acknowledged 0
firing 0
the 0
weapon, 0
but 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
accident. 0

Zarate 0
and 0
his 0
defense 0
team 0
maintained 0
the 0
argument 0
that 0
the 0
suspect 0
found 0
the 0
stolen 0
weapon 0
on 0
the 0
pier 0
that 0
day 0
and 0
it 0
“just 1
fired.” 1
The 0
gun 0
belonged 0
to 0
a 0
federal 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Land 0
Management 0
ranger 0
and 0
was 0
stolen 0
from 0
his 0
parked 0
car 0
a 0
week 0
earlier. 0

The 0
bullet 0
ricocheted 0
on 0
the 0
pier’s 0
concrete 0
walkway 0
before 0
it 0
struck 0
Steinle, 0
killing 0
her. 0

Zarate 0
has 0
admitted 0
to 0
shooting 0
Steinle, 0
but 0
says 0
it 0
was 0
an 0
accident. 0

Defense 0
attorney 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
said 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
found 0
the 0
gun 0
at 0
the 0
pier… 0
but 0
the 0
stories 0
of 0
what 0
happened 0
copntradicted 0
one 0
another… 0

He 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
wrapped 0
in 0
cloth, 0
and 0
when 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
unwrapped 0
it, 0
the 0
gun 0
accidentally 0
discharged. 0

But 0
in 0
a 0
police 0
interrogation, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
admitted 0
to 0
firing 0
the 0
gun, 0
saying 0
he 0
was 0
aiming 0
at 0
a 0
seal. 0

He 0
also 0
told 0
police 0
that 0
he 0
stepped 0
on 0
the 0
gun, 0
causing 0
it 0
to 0
fire. 0

But 0
still, 0
after 0
six 0
days 0
of 0
deliberation, 0
the 0
illegal 0
Mexcian 0
immigrant 0
was 0
acquitted 0
of 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges 0
and 0
also 0
found 0
not 0
guilty 0
of 0
assault 0
with 0
a 0
firearm. 0

Garcia 0
Zarate 0
was 0
found 0
guilty 0
of 0
illegal 0
firearms 0
possession, 0
which 0
carries 0
a 0
sentence 0
of 0
16 0
months 0
to 0
three 0
years. 0

The 0
public 0
defender 0
wasted 0
no 0
time 0
in 0
focusing 0
his 0
thoughts 0
on 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
administration…saying 0
Zarate 0
was 0
“extremely 1
relieved” 1
by 0
the 0
outcome 0
and 0
that 0
while 0
Steinle’s 0
death 0
“was 0
a 1
horrible 1
tragedy,” 1
it 0
was 0
used 0
as 0
“political 1
fodder 1
for 0
then 0
candidate 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
anti-immigration 0
agenda.” 0

Adachi 0
added, 0
“Despite 0
the 0
unfairly 1
politicized 1
atmosphere 0
surrounding 0
this 0
case, 0
jurors 0
focused 0
on 0
the 0
evidence, 0
which 0
was 0
clear 0
and 0
convincing, 0
and 0
rendered 0
a 0
just 0
verdict.” 0

In 0
a 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
verdict, 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Jeff 0
Sessions 0
released 0
a 0
statement 0
saying 0
that 0
despite 0
California’s 0
attempt 0
at 0
a 0
murder 0
conviction, 0
Zarate 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
walk 0
away 0
with 0
only 0
a 0
firearm 0
possession 0
conviction 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
not 0
turned 0
over 0
by 0
San 0
Francisco 0
to 0
ICE. 0

“When 1
jurisdictions 1
choose 1
to 1
return 1
criminal 1
aliens 1
to 1
the 1
streets 1
rather 1
than 1
turning 1
them 1
over 1
to 1
federal 1
immigration 1
authorities, 1
they 1
put 1
the 1
public’s 1
safety 1
at 1
risk,” 1
the 0
statement 0
said. 0

“San 1
Francisco’s 1
decision 1
to 1
protect 1
criminal 1
aliens 1
led 1
to 1
the 1
preventable 1
and 1
heartbreaking 1
death 1
of 1
Kate 1
Steinle.” 1
Sessions 0
continued, 0
“I 0
urge 0
the 0
leaders 0
of 0
the 0
nation’s 0
communities 0
to 0
reflect 0
on 0
the 0
outcome 0
of 0
this 0
case 0
and 0
consider 0
carefully 0
the 0
harm 0
they 0
are 0
doing 0
to 0
their 0
citizens 0
by 0
refusing 0
to 0
cooperate 0
with 0
federal 0
law 0
enforcement 0
officers.” 0

Social 0
media 0
erupted 0
with 0
outrage 0
at 0
the 0
verdict 0
(with 0
very 0
few 0
– 0
if 0
any 0
attempting 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
verdict)… 0

I 0
don't 0
know 0
any 0
American 1
citizen 1
who 0
is 0
a 0
5x 0
felon 0
and 0
could 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
killing 0
someone 0
with 0
a 0

the 0

announced 0
an 0

The 0

of 0
its 0
legal 0
battle 0
to 0
get 0

back 0
in 0

granted 0
the 0

order 0
and 0
preliminary 0
injunction 0
Friday 0
that 0

Kelly 0
ordered 0
that 0

be 0

immediately. 0

He 0
did 0
not 0
rule 0
on 0
CNN’s 0
claim 0
that 0
the 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
pass 0
violated 0

under 0

did 0
not 0
provide 0
Acosta 0
with 0
due 0
process 0
to 0
legally 0
remove 0

The 0

held 0
Wednesday 0
in 0
Washington, 0
where 0
lawyers 0
for 0
CNN 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
faced 0
off 0
over 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
press 0
access. 0

CNN 0
had 0
the 0
broad 0
support 0
of 0
other 0
news 0
organizations 0
that 0
believed 0
the 0
White 0
House’s 0
actions 0
posed 0
a 0
challenge 0
to 0
press 0
freedom. 0

“We 0
are 0
gratified 0
with 0
this 0
result 0
and 0
we 0
look 0
forward 0
to 0
a 0
full 0
resolution 0
in 0
the 0
coming 0
days,” 0
a 0
CNN 0
representative 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

“Our 0
sincere 0
thanks 0
to 0
all 0
who 0
have 0
supported 0
not 0
just 0
CNN, 0
but 0
a 0
free, 1
strong 1
and 1
independent 1
American 1
press.” 1

The 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
it 0
would 0
abide 0
by 0
Kelly’s 0
ruling. 0

“Today, 0
the 0
court 0
made 0
clear 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
absolute 0
right 0
to 0
access 0
the 0
White 0
House. 0

In 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
court, 0
we 0
will 0
temporarily 0
reinstate 0
the 0
reporter’s 0
hard 0
pass,” 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
secretary 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0

said 0
in 0

“We 0

There 0
must 0
be 0

in 0
the 0

Acosta’s 0

credential 0
was 0
revoked 0
by 0

on 0

after 0
a 0
testy 1
exchange 0
with 0
President 0
Donald 0

at 0
a 0

House 0
news 0
conference. 0

point, 0

refused 0
to 0
relinquish 0
the 0

to 0
a 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
who 0
tried 0
to 0
retrieve 0
it 0

him. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
latest 0
in 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
public 0
confrontations 0
between 0
Acosta 0
and 0
Trump, 0
who 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
characterized 0
CNN’s 0
critical 0
coverage 0
of 0
him 0
as 0
“fake 1
news” 1
since 0
the 0
2016 0

campaign. 0

CNN’s 0
suit 0
filed 0
Tuesday 0
says 0
the 0
suspension 0
of 0
Acosta’s 0
credential 0
violates 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment’s 0
protection 0
of 0
free 0

It 0
also 0
says 0
the 0
way 0
the 0

revoked 0
the 0
pass, 0
with 0
no 0
direct 0
notice 0
to 0

or 0

“This 0

is 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
years 0
of 0

by 0

based 0

exclude 0

says. 0

Responding 0
to 0
the 0
CNN 0
suit, 0
lawyers 0
for 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
said 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
had 0
broad 0
discretion 0
to 0
regulate 0
access 0
to 0
journalists 0
and 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
public. 0

“If 0
the 0
president 0
wants 0
to 0
exclude 0
all 0
reporters 0
from 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
grounds, 0
he 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
do 0
that,” 0
Deputy 0
Assistant 0
Attorney 0
General 0
James 0
Burnham 0
said 0
during 0
the 0
hearing. 0

“There’s 0
no 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right.” 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
argued 0
that 0
Acosta’s 0
behavior, 0
which 0
it 0
described 0
as 0
rude 1
and 0
aggressive, 1
was 0
the 0
reason 0
for 0
revoking 0
his 0
credential. 0

Mark 0
Lukasiewicz, 0
dean 0
of 0
The 0
Lawrence 0
Herbert 0
School 0
of 0
Communication 0
at 0
Hofstra 0
University 0
and 0
a 0
former 0

executive, 0
praised 0
the 0
judge’s 0
decision, 0
which 0
he 0
said 0
was 0
not 0
a 0
surprise. 0

“The 0
White 0

has 0
lots 0
of 0
other 0
ways 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
the 0
behavior 0
of 0

if 0
that’s 0
their 0
concern, 0
but 0
closing 0
the 0
gate 0
to 0
a 0
news 0
organization 0
is 0
not 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
ways, 0
and 0
it’s 0
important 0
that 0
the 0
court 0
stood 0
up 0

said 0
that,” 0
Lukasiewicz 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
a 0
reporter 0
has 0
behaved 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
a 0
president 0
doesn’t 0
like.” 0

Lukasiewicz 0
believed 0
CNN 0
would 0
reach 0
a 0
compromise 0
with 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
rather 0
than 0
engage 0
in 0
a 0
prolonged 0
court 0
battle. 0

“The 0
law 0
and 0
the 0
Constitution 0
is 0
very 0
clear 0
here,” 0
he 0
said. 0

CNN’s 0
suit 0
received 0
the 0
support 0
of 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
dozen 0
news 0
organizations 0
including 0
Fox 0
News, 0
where 0
commentators 0
have 0
often 0
echoed 0
Trump’s 0
criticisms 0
of 0
the 0
network’s 0
coverage. 0

Rival 0
news 0
organizations 0
came 0
to 0
the 0
defense 0
of 0
Fox 0
News 0
in 0
2009 0
when 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
attempted 0
to 0
exclude 0
its 0
reporters 0
from 0
interviews 0
with 0
officials 0
that 0
were 0
offered 0
to 0
all 0
other 0

Fox 0
News 0

were 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
harshest 0
critics 0
during 0
his 0
eight 0
years 0
in 0
office, 0
and 0
he 0
often 0
complained 0
about 0
it 0
in 0

But 0
the 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
vs 0
Contemplative 0
Orders 0

The 0
Francis 0
Vatican’s 0
approach 0
to 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
is 0
probably 0
the 0
most 0
illustrative 0
of 0
our 0
entire 0
crisis. 0

Contemplative 0
life 0
is 0
aimed 0
only 0
at 0
a 0
purely 0
supernatural 0
end. 0

It 0
has 0
no 0
“use” 0
in 0
the 0
sense 0
that 0
either 0
the 0
Bergoglians 0
– 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
their 0
political 0
machinations 0
– 0
or 0
the 0
world 0
can 0
understand. 0

There 0
is 0
probably 0
no 0
other 0
place 0
where 0
the 0
differences 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
programmes 0
- 0
the 0
Catholic 0
programme 0
of 0
Christ 0
and 0
the 0
Bergoglian/Kasperian 0
programme 0
- 0
are 0
more 0
sharply 0
contrasted. 0

One 0
aspect 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
character 0
that 0
seems 0
little-explored 0
by 0
the 0
Catholic 0
and 0
secular 0
media 0
alike 0
is 0
his 0
apparent 0
disdain 0
for 0
contemplative 0
religious 0
life 0
– 0
a 0
facet 0
of 0
Catholic 0
life 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
described 0
as 0
the 0
most 0
purely 0
religious 0
of 0
all 0
the 0
Church’s 0
undertakings. 0

The 0
world 0
does 0
not 0
understand 0
it 0
or 0
want 0
it. 0

Therefore, 0
it 0
is 0
something 0
of 0
a 0
thorn 0
in 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
side, 0
and 0
he 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
expressed 0
his 0
contempt 0
for 0
it. 0

So 0
when, 0
in 0
2016 0
he 0
issued 0
a 0
document 0
on 0
contemplative 0
nuns, 0
the 0
faithful 0
braced 0
for 0
impact 0
. 0

In 0
his 0
recent 0
document, 0
ostensibly 0
on 0
holiness, 0
“Gaudete 0
et 0
Exultate,” 0
the 0
pope 0
attacked 1
the 0
religious 0
desire 0
for 0
silence 0
and 0
solitude, 0
to 0
be 0
alone 0
with 0
God 0
in 0
prayer, 0
seeking 0
unity 0
with 0
Him, 0
saying 0
in 0
essence 0
that 0
the 0
Christian 0
life 0
is 0
inherently 0
about 0
social 0
activism, 0
about 0
material, 0
worldly 0
ends. 0

To 0
these 0
foundations 0
of 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
– 0
indeed 0
of 0
any 0
form 0
of 0
religious 0
life 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
– 0
Francis 0
set 0
up 0
another 0
of 0
his 0
false 1
dichotomies, 0
contemplation 0
in 0
opposition 0
to 0
serving 0
others, 0
giving 0
a 0
Jesuit 0
maxim 0
as 0
an 0
imperative 0
for 0
all 0
Catholics: 0
“We 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
be 0
contemplatives 0
even 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
action, 0
and 0
to 0
grow 0
in 0
holiness 0
by 0
responsibly 0
and 0
generously 0
carrying 0
out 0
our 0
proper 0
mission.” 0

Italian 0
Vaticanist 0
Marco 0
Tosatti 0
commented 0
dryly, 0
“Rejoice 0
and 0
be 0
glad… 0
but 0
not 0
if 0
you’re 0
a 0
cloistered 0
contemplative.” 0

In 0
2016, 0
I 0
wrote 0
that 0
Francis’ 0
Apostolic 0
Constitution, 0
“Vultum 0
dei 0
quaerere” 0
was 0
in 0
some 0
respects 0
the 1
most 1
damaging 1
object 0
of 0
the 0
wrecking-ball 1
pontificate 0
to 0
date. 0

Unfortunately, 0
it 0
was 0
about 0
a 0
subject 0
that 0
the 0
world, 0
and 0
therefore 0
the 0
modern 0
Church, 0
cares 0
so 0
little 0
about 0
that 0
hardly 0
anyone 0
noticed. 0

Aimed 0
specifically 0
at 0
female 0
contemplative 0
religious, 0
the 0
document 0
threatened 0
that 0
in 0
a 0
year 0
or 0
so 0
another 0
would 0
be 0
forthcoming 0
laying 0
out 0
precisely 0
what 0
would 0
now 0
be 0
required 0
of 0
nuns 0
to 0
continue 0
in 0
their 0
vocations. 0

The 0
new 0
document 0
issued 0
last 0
week, 0
“Cor 0
orans,” 0
is 0
juridical, 0
that 0
is, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
much 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
specific 0
norms, 0
or 0
rules 0
– 0
289 0
of 0
them! 0

– 0
that 0
all 0
communities 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
now 0
follow. 0

One 0
odd 0
remark 0
in 0
article 0
19 0
is 0
maybe 0
the 0
most 0
succinct 0
description 0
of 0
the 0
direction 0
planned 0
for 0
contemplatives: 0

“A 0
monastery 0
of 0
nuns, 0
as 0
every 0
religious 0
house, 0
is 0
erected 0
while 0
keeping 0
in 0
mind 0
its 0
usefulness 0
for 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
Institute.” 0
(emphasis 0
added) 0

Wait… 0
its 0
“usefulness”? 0

I 0
think 0
a 0
fair 0
question 0
for 0
the 0
Faithful 0
to 0
ask 0
this 0
Vatican 0
department 0
might 0
be, 0
“According 0
to 0
what 0
specific 0
criteria 0
is 0
a 0
monastery’s 0
‘usefulness’ 0
actually 0
determined?” 0

One 0
can’t 0
help 0
but 0
hearken 0
back 0
to 0
the 0
criteria 0
for 0
monasteries 0
that 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
survive 0
the 0
revolutionary 0
purges 0
in 0
18th 0
and 0
19th 0
century 0
Europe. 0

A 0
house 0
that 0
could 0
prove 0
to 0
the 0
secularists 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
“useful” 0
– 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
care 0
for 0
the 0
indigent 0
elderly, 0
teach 0
children 0
or 0
nurse 0
the 0
sick 0
– 0
would 0
be 0
allowed 0
to 0
continue. 0

Those 0
which 0
were 0
purely 0
contemplative 0
– 0
a 0
single-minded 0
devotion 0
to 0
the 0
adoration 0
of 0
God 0
– 0
were 0
closed. 0

It 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
insignificant 0
quirk 0
of 0
modern 0
history, 0
and 0
one 0
that 0
tells 0
us 0
much 0
about 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
pontificate, 0
that 0
houses 0
of 0
contemplatives 0
are 0
always 0
attacked 0
by 0
secularist 0
regimes, 0
from 1
Henry 1
VIII 1
to 1
the 1
Soviet 1
Union. 1

Rupture? 0

What 0
rupture? 0

The 0
first 0
thing 0
Cor 0
orans 0
does 0
is 0
claim 0
continuity 0
with 0
both 0
pre 0
and 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
theology. 0

In 0
the 0
Introduction, 0
it 0
seems 0
anxious 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
“hermeneutic 0
of 0
continuity” 0
with 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
his 0
document 0
Sponsa 0
Christi 0
Ecclesia 0
of 0
1950. 0

The 0
authors 0
insist 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
contradiction 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
– 0
except, 0
of 0
course, 0
where 0
there 0
are 0
contradictions 0
– 0
and 0
that 0
both 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
Francis 0
are 0
keen 0
to 0
see 0
nuns 0
reaching 0
the 0
“aim 0
of 0
their 0
specific 0
vocation.” 0
It 0
describes 0
Francis 0
as 0
promulgating 0
this 0
document 0
“in 0
the 0
wake” 0
of 0
Pius 0
XII[1]. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Pope 0
Francis, 0
by 0
promulgating 0
the 0
Apostolic 0
Constitution 0
Vultum 0
Dei 0
quaerere, 0
on 0
June 0
29, 0
2016, 0
to 0
help 0
the 0
contemplatives 0
reach 0
the 0
aim 0
of 0
their 0
specific 0
vocation, 0
invited 0
reflection 0
and 0
discernment 0
on 0
the 0
precise 0
content 0
tied 0
to 0
consecrated 0
life 0
in 0
general 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
monastic 0
tradition 0
in 0
particular, 0
but 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
intend 0
to 0
abrogate 0
Sponsa 0
Christi 0
Ecclesia 0
that 0
was 0
derogated 0
only 0
in 0
some 0
points. 0

As 0
a 0
consequence, 0
the 0
two 0
pontifical 0
documents 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
held 0
as 0
normative 0
in 0
force 0
for 0
monasteries 0
of 0
nuns 0
and 0
must 0
be 0
read 0
in 0
a 0
unitary 0
vision. 0

But 0
of 0
course, 0
the 0
entire 0
game 0
is 0
given 0
away 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
paragraph: 0

Pope 0
Francis, 0
in 0
the 0
wake 0
of 0
the 0
teaching 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
and 0
reaffirmed 0
by 0
Ecumenical 0
Vatican 0
Council 0
II, 0
intended 0
to 0
present 0
in 0
Vultum 0
Dei 0
quaerere 0
the 0
intense 0
and 0
fruitful 1
path 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
decades, 0
in 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
teachings 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Council 0
and 0
considering 0
the 0
changed 0
socio-cultural 0
conditions. 0

Yes, 0
that’s 0
what 0
it 0
said. 0

Here’s 0
my 1
translation: 1

“The 0
Church’s 0
‘path’ 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
50 0
years 0
has 0
been 0
‘fruitful’. 1

How 0
do 0
you 0
know? 0

Because 0
we’re 0
telling 0
you 0
it 0
has.” 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
there 0
have 0
been 0
absolutely 1
no 1
problems 1
whatever 1
with 0
the 0
direction 0
taken 0
either 0
by 0
the 0
Church 0
or 0
by 0
the 0
religious 0
life 0
since 0
Vatican 0
II. 0

Everything 0
that 0
has 0
happened 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
complete 1
and 1
perfect 1
continuity 0
between 0
the 0
Before 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
After 0
Church; 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
no 0
rupture 0
or 0
break 0
with 0
the 0
past. 0

All 0
changes 0
undertaken 0
by 0
religious 0
houses 0
were 0
perfectly 1
legitimate 0
and 0
good 0
- 0
“fruitful” 1
if, 0
perhaps, 0
a 0
bit 0
“intense” 0
– 0
and 0
have 0
been 0
made 0
in 0
“light 0
of 0
the 0
teachings” 0
of 0
Vatican 0
II 0
and 0
“changed 0
socio-cultural 0
conditions.” 0
There 0
is, 0
therefore, 0
no 0
legitimate 0
reason 0
whatever 0
for 0
any 0
religious 0
house 0
to 0
attempt 0
to 0
“turn 0
back 0
the 0
clock” 0
to 0
the 0
pre-Vatican 0
II 0
norms 0
or 0
styles 0
of 0
religious 0
life. 0

Anyone 1
attempting 1
to 1
do 1
this 1
are 1
Bad 1
Nuns 1
[insert 0
string 0
of 0
incomprehensible 0
papal 0
insults 0
here.] 0

This 0
is 0
what 0
might 0
be 0
considered 0
the 0
guiding 0
principle 0
of 0
the 0
document; 0
“Nothing 0
to 0
see 0
here. 0

And 0
if 0
you 0
say 0
there 0
is, 0
you’re 0
the 0
problem.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
kind 0
of 0
bold 0
proclamation 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
in 0
keeping 0
with 0
the 0
habit 0
of 0
this 0
pontificate 0
to 0
simply 0
claim 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
problems 0
and 0
become 0
gravely 1
offended 1
and 1
outraged 1
when 0
the 0
contrary 0
is 0
pointed 0
out. 0

It’s 0
your 0
fault 0
if 0
you 0
find 0
contradictions, 0
not 0
theirs; 0
they’ve 0
said 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
contradictions, 0
therefore 0
there 0
aren’t 0
any. 0

After 0
all, 0
this 0
is 0
the 0
papacy 0
where 0
2 0
+ 0
2 0
= 0
5 0
if 0
the 0
pope 0
says 0
it 0
does. 0

The 0
irony, 0
of 0
course, 0
is 0
built 0
in, 0
since 0
this 0
document 0
is 0
intended 0
as 0
a 0
legal 0
chopping 0
block 0
for 0
the 0
dissolution 0
of 0
any 0
house 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
that 0
is 0
judged 0
to 0
be 0
hovering 0
on 0
the 0
edge 0
of 0
extinction 1
or 0
is 0
for 0
some 0
other 0
reason 0
in 0
need 0
of 0
the 0
chop. 0

Why 0
would 0
the 0
Vatican 0
need 0
a 0
document 0
giving 0
extensive 0
norms 0
for 0
the 0
closure 0
of 0
monasteries 0
that 0
have 0
too 0
few 0
nuns 0
or 0
do 0
not 0
follow 0
their 0
originally 0
intended 0
charisms 0
if 0
everything 0
about 0
the 0
religious 0
life 0
since 0
Vatican 0
II 0
has 0
been 0
hunky 0
dory? 0

Let’s 0
remember 0
that 0
this 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
of 0
Braz 0
de’Aviz 0
and 0
Jose 0
Rodriguez 0
Carballo. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
Cardinal 0
Braz 0
de’Aviz[2] 0
who 0
wasted 0
no 0
time 0
in 0
orienting 0
himself 0
in 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
when, 0
close 0
on 0
the 0
heels 0
of 0
the 0
Conclave 0
he 0
slammed 0
the 0
attempt 0
by 0
his 0
predecessor 0
– 0
and 0
by 0
extension 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
– 0
to 0
reign 0
in 0
the 0
notorious 0
Leadership 0
Conference 0
of 0
Women 0
Religious 0
in 0
the 0
US. 0

He 0
complained 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
shut 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
process 0
under 0
Cardinal 0
Rode, 0
and 0
later 0
made 0
a 0
large 0
and 0
public 0
point 0
of 0
appeasing 0
and 0
mollifying 0
the 1
most 1
outspokenly 1
heretical 1
and 1
politicised 1
organisation 1
of 1
female 1
religious 1
in 1
the 1
world. 1

Apparently 0
the 0
total 0
statistical 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
religious 0
life 0
following 0
Vatican 0
II[3] 0
had 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0
the 0
massive 0
systemic 0
changes 0
to 0
the 0
forms 0
of 0
that 0
life 0
– 0
always 0
claimed 0
to 0
be 0
“mandated” 0
by 0
“the 0
Council”. 0

And 0
of 0
course 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
priorities 0
of 0
a 0
pope 0
who 0
has 0
said 0
that 0
seeing 0
a 0
“restorationist” 0
community 0
enjoying 0
a 0
large 0
number 0
of 0
vocations 0
makes 0
him 0
“worry.” 0
Apparently 0
this 0
worry 0
was 0
serious 0
enough 0
to 0
move 0
him 0
to 0
torpedo 1
one 0
of 0
the 1
most 1
flourishing 1
communities 0
in 0
the 0
modern 0
Church; 0
the 0
gaunt 1
spectre 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
and 0
Sisters 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate 0
haunts 0
this 0
document. 0

Autonomy 1
vs. 0

Independence 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
talking 0
points 0
the 0
media 0
have 0
latched 0
onto 0
is 0
the 0
whole 0
business 0
of 0
“autonomy” 1
of 0
monasteries. 0

Many 0
of 0
the 0
headlines 0
crowed: 0
“Vatican 0
confirms 0
nuns’ 0
autonomy,” 1
or 0
similar. 0

But 0
that 0
word 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
what 0
they 0
think 0
it 0
means. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
word 0
“autonomy” 1
is 0
the 0
key 0
to 0
understanding 0
this 0
whole 0
thing. 0

It 0
appears 0
in 0
the 0
document 0
16 0
times 0
and 0
“autonomous” 1
30 0
times. 0

In 0
fact, 0
“autonomy” 1
is 0
held 0
up 0
as 0
the 0
single 0
most 0
important 0
criterion 0
for 0
determining 0
a 0
monastery’s 0
viability. 0

This 0
emphasis 0
is 0
repeated 0
so 0
often 0
one 0
might 0
almost 0
think 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
concern 0
in 0
Rome 0
that 0
the 0
“fruitful” 1
post-conciliar 0
monastic 0
life 0
is 0
in 0
danger 0
of 0
fizzling 0
out… 0
for… 0
some 0
reason… 0

Monastery 0
sui 0
juris 0
refers 0
to 0
the 0
religious 0
house 0
of 0
a 0
female 0
monastic 0
community 0
that, 0
having 0
the 0
requisites 0
for 0
real 0
autonomy 1
of 0
life, 0
was 0
legitimately 0
erected 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
and 0
enjoys 0
juridical 0
autonomy 1
under 0
the 0
law. 0

18 0
In 0
order 0
to 0
obtain 0
juridical 0
autonomy 1
for 0
a 0
monastery 0
of 0
nuns, 0
it 0
must 0
presuppose 0
a 0
real 0
autonomy 1
of 0
life, 0
that 0
is, 0
the 0
ability 0
to 0
manage 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
monastery 0
in 0
all 0
its 0
dimensions 0
(vocational, 0
formative, 0
governmental, 0
relational, 0
liturgical, 0
economic 0
...). 0

In 0
this 0
case, 0
an 0
autonomous 1
monastery 0
is 0
alive 0
and 0
vital. 0

43 0
Autonomy 1
of 0
life, 0
a 0
constant 0
prerequisite 0
for 0
maintaining 0
juridical 0
autonomy, 1
must 0
be 0
constantly 0
verified 0
by 0
the 0
Federal 0
President 0
who, 0
when 0
in 0
her 0
judgment 0
a 0
monastery 0
lacks 0
autonomy 1
of 0
life, 0
must 0
inform 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
in 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
nomination 0
of 0
an 0
ad 0
hoc 0
commission. 0

67 0
Affiliation 0
[with 0
another 0
monastery, 0
appointed 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican] 0
can 0
be 0
an 0
opportunity 0
for 0
recovery 0
and 0
rebirth 0
when 0
autonomy 1
of 0
life 0
is 0
partially 0
compromised. 0

If 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
incapacity 0
is 0
irreversible, 0
the 0
solution, 0
as 0
painful 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
necessary, 0
is 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
the 0
monastery. 0

no 0
longer 0
possesses 0
a 0
real 0
autonomy 1
of 0
life 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
responsibility 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
President 0
to 0
report 0
the 0
matter 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

When 0
an 0
autonomous 0
monastery 0
, 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
responsibility 0
ofto 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

At 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
this 0
document 0
is 0
redefining 0
the 0
term 0
“autonomous” 1
to 0
exclude 0
independence. 0

What 0
got 0
no 0
mention 0
in 0
the 0
brief 0
press 0
interest 0
was 0
the 0
document’s 0
insistence 0
that 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
nuns 0
must 0
belong 0
to 0
a 0
federation 0
and 0
while 0
monasteries 0
must 0
demonstrate 0
“autonomy” 1
they 0
will 0
be 0
granted 0
little 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
powers 0
of 0
self-governance. 0

As 0
we 0
will 0
see, 0
the 0
federations 0
are 0
now 0
a 0
multilayered 0
system 0
of 0
internal 0
surveillance 0
and 0
centralised 0
control 0
that 0
leaves 0
Orwell 0
in 0
the 0
dust: 0

overcome 0
isolation 0
and 0
promote 0
regular 0
observance 0
and 0
contemplative 0
life. 0

Federation 0
of 0
monasteries 0
means 0
a 0
structure 0
of 0
communion 0
among 0
some 0
autonomous 0
monasteries 0
of 0
the 0
same 0
Institute 0
[4] 0
, 0
erected 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
that 0
approves 0
the 0
Statutes, 0
so 0
that 0
in 0
sharing 0
the 0
same 0
charism, 0
the 0
federated 0
monasteriesand 0
promote 0
regular 0
observance 0
and 0
contemplative 0
life. 0

Note 0
the 0
change: 0
“independent” 0
is 0
replaced 0
with 0
“isolated[5].” 0
It 0
reminds 0
me 0
of 0
a 0
conversation 0
I 0
had 0
with 0
a 0
superior 0
of 0
a 0
Benedictine 0
house 0
in 0
the 0
UK. 0

She 0
said 0
she 0
thought 0
that 0
the 0
psychiatric 0
testing, 0
that 0
in 0
2008 0
was 0
still 0
all 0
the 0
rage 0
among 0
the 0
houses 0
of 0
her 0
monastery’s 0
federation, 0
was 0
excessive 0
and 0
not 0
helpful. 0

She 0
didn’t 0
trust 0
the 0
heavily 0
secularised 0
field 0
of 0
psychology 0
to 0
help 0
in 0
determining 0
a 0
candidate’s 0
suitability 0
for 0
religious 0
life, 0
so 0
she 0
didn’t 0
require 0
these 0
tests 0
of 0
her 0
monastery’s 0
postulants. 0

She 0
also 0
said 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
under 0
constant 0
pressure, 0
both 0
the 0
subtle 0
pressure 0
of 0
general 0
peer 0
disapproval 0
and 0
overt 0
requests 0
to 0
conform 0
by 0
the 0
federation’s 0
leadership. 0

Was 0
that 0
monastery 0
“isolated”? 0

Or 0
just 0
exercising 0
lawful 0
self-governance? 0

And 0
given 0
that 0
autonomy 1
is 0
being 0
held 0
up 0
as 0
the 0
sole 0
criterion 0
for 0
viability 0
of 0
a 0
monastery, 0
it 0
seems 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
is 0
not 0
interested 0
in 0
asking 0
whether 0
it 0
is 0
actually 0
faithful 0
to 0
the 0
charism, 0
or 0
even 0
to 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Faith, 0
a 0
question 0
that 0
has 0
burned 0
brightly 0
for 0
serious 0
Catholics 0
for 0
some 0
time. 0

The 0
word 0
“fidelity” 0
appears 0
in 0
the 0
document 0
four 0
times, 0
which 0
may 0
give 0
an 0
idea 0
of 0
how 0
much 0
interest 0
the 0
Vatican 0
has 0
in 0
this 0
issue. 0

Funny 0
you 0
should 0
mention 0
autonomy: 1
Bioethics 0
and 0
the 0
dissolution 0
of 0
“unviable” 0
monasteries 0

It’s 0
funny 0
that 0
the 0
buzzword 0
of 0
the 0
day 0
in 0
Rome 0
should 0
be 0
“autonomy”. 1

As 0
we 0
shall 0
see, 0
the 0
document 0
is 0
what 0
I’ve 0
called 0
above 0
a 0
“chopping 0
block”. 0

Vultum 0
dei 0
quaerere 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
this 0
juridical 0
document 0
would 0
provide 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
legal 0
criteria 0
by 0
which 0
a 0
monastery 0
can 0
be 0
considered 0
viable, 0
religious 0
life 0
worthy 0
of 0
life, 0
so 0
to 0
speak, 0
and 0
that 0
those 0
considered 0
to 0
have 0
failed 0
the 0
test 0
would 0
be 0
closed. 0

Note 0
the 0
language 0
used 0
here: 0

If 0
the 0
situation 0
of 0
incapacity 0
is 0
irreversible, 0
the 0
solution, 0
as 0
painful 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
necessary, 0
is 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
the 0
monastery. 0

It 0
jogged 0
a 0
memory 0
for 0
me. 0

“Incapacity”… 0
Where 0
had 0
I 0
heard 0
that 0
language 0
used 0
before? 0

Most 0
pro-life 0
observers 0
in 0
Britain 0
will 0
tell 0
you 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
the 0
“Mental 0
Capacity 0
Act” 0
of 0
2005 0
that 0
established 0
in 0
British 0
law 0
the 0
concept 0
that 0
a 0
person 0
with 0
permanently 0
“reduced 0
capacity” 0
could 0
be 0
legally 0
starved 0
and/or 0
dehydrated 0
to 0
death 0
by 0
doctors. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
world, 0
the 0
language, 0
of 0
Bioethics, 0
applied 0
utilitarianism, 0
also 0
called 0
“Principlism” 0
after 0
its 0
three 0
bioethical 0
criteria 0
of 0
“justice, 0
beneficence[6] 0
and 0
autonomy” 1
– 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
patient’s 0
ability 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
his 0
“autonomy” 1
or 0
“quality 0
of 0
life,[7]” 0
either 0
currently 0
or 0
potentially, 0
that 0
decides 0
his 0
fate. 0

This 0
set 0
of 0
criteria 0
is 0
being 0
applied 0
in 0
medical 0
institutions 0
across 0
the 0
western 0
world 0
now, 0
a 0
“new 0
paradigm” 0
of 0
ethics 0
replacing 0
traditional 0
“Hippocratic” 0
or 0
“Natural 0
Law” 0
medical 0
ethics. 0

Under 0
this 0
system 0
the 0
onus, 0
effectively, 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
patient 0
to 0
prove 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
new 0
criteria 0
that 0
he 0
is 0
worthy 0
of 0
receiving 0
medical 0
treatment 0
– 0
of 0
continuing 0
to 0
live. 0

Medical 0
treatment 0
(which 0
legally 0
includes 0
food 0
and 0
water) 0
can 0
be 0
withdrawn 0
from 0
patients 0
who 0
fail 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
recover 0
sufficiently 0
to 0
return 0
to 0
an 0
autonomous 1
lifestyle. 0

Health 0
care 0
systems 0
like 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
UK 0
have 0
government 0
regulatory 0
boards 0
giving 0
out 0
“guidelines” 0
to 0
determine 0
in 0
a 0
uniform 0
way 0
how 0
health 0
care 0
resources 0
are 0
allocated. 0

These 0
guidelines 0
are 0
collated 0
by 0
professional 0
Bioethicists 0
applying 0
their 0
utilitarian 0
criteria. 0

If 0
the 0
equation 0
doesn’t 0
come 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
patient’s 0
favour, 0
the 0
“treatment” 0
recommended 0
for 0
the 0
patient’s 0
“best 0
interests” 0
will 0
include 0
his 0
demise, 0
often 0
procured 0
by 0
withdrawing 0
nutrition 0
and 0
hydration 0
and/or 0
administering 0
slowly 0
lethal 0
doses 0
of 0
sedatives. 0

The 0
NHS 0
in 0
the 0
UK 0
has 0
actually 0
gone 0
to 0
court, 0
and 0
won, 0
declaring 0
that 0
they 0
must 0
retain 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
kill 0
patients 0
who 0
fail 0
the 0
Bioethics 0
test. 0

The 0
result 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
quiet 0
reign 1
of 1
terror 1
in 0
which 0
elderly 0
and 0
disabled 0
people 0
have 0
started 0
carrying 0
cards 0
stating 0
in 0
legalese 0
that 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
killed 0
by 0
their 0
doctors. 0

In 0
one 0
case 0
a 0
man 0
with 0
ALS 0
took 0
the 0
NHS 0
to 0
court 0
in 0
an 0
ultimately 0
unsuccessful 0
attempt 0
to 0
preemptively 0
preclude 0
his 0
medical 0
murder 0
when 0
his 0
illness 0
left 0
him 0
incapacitated. 0

The 0
system, 0
in 0
other 0
words, 0
is 0
stacked 0
against 0
the 0
patient, 0
in 0
favour 0
of 0
the 0
government 0
that 0
holds 0
all 0
the 0
cards. 0

Keep 0
these 0
facts 0
in 0
mind 0
as 0
we 0
read 0
through 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
document. 0

I 0
think 0
we 0
can 0
find 0
an 0
almost 0
perfect 0
analogy 0
by 0
replacing 0
the 0
term 0
“patient” 0
with 0
“monastery.” 0
Think 0
about 0
how 0
one 0
would 0
apply 0
concepts 0
like 0
“autonomy,” 1
“viability,” 0
“incapacity,” 0
“quality 0
of 0
life” 0
and 0
“equitable 0
distribution 0
of 0
scarce 0
resources” 0
to 0
this 0
context. 0

When 0
the 0
language 0
of 0
utilitarianism 0
appears 0
in 0
Vatican 0
documents 0
as 0
guiding 0
criteria 0
for 0
the 0
contemplative 0
religious 0
life, 0
one 0
has 0
to 0
wonder 0
at 0
what 0
point 0
has 0
the 0
entire 0
project 0
gone 0
so 0
disastrously 1
off 0
the 0
rails. 0

Federations 0
as 0
Vatican 0
watchdogs 0

Under 0
this 0
law, 0
all 0
monasteries 0
of 0
contemplative 0
nuns 0
must 0
belong 0
to 0
a 0
federation. 0

Previously 0
only 0
voluntary 0
and 0
consultative, 0
federations 0
will 0
now 0
have 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
supervise 0
and 0
guide 0
the 0
formation 0
of 0
candidates, 0
nuns 0
and 0
of 0
their 0
formators, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
possess 0
broad 0
powers 0
over 0
temporal 0
goods 0
of 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
and 0
powers 0
of 0
suppression. 0

The 0
document 0
makes 0
it 0
inarguable 0
that 0
the 0
federation’s 0
main 0
role 0
will 0
be 0
to 0
establish 0
and 0
monitor 0
for 0
conformity 0
to 0
a 0
particular 0
programme 0
– 0
the 0
“intense 0
and 0
fruitful 1
path” 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
since 0
1965 0
– 0
both 0
within 0
the 0
various 0
orders 0
and 0
between 0
them: 0

The 0
Federal 0
Assembly: 0

deals 0
with 0
issues 0
of 0
major 0
importance; 0
makes 0
decisions 0
and 0
issues 0
norms 0
that 0
all 0
nuns 0
are 0
required 0
to 0
observe, 0
after 0
the 0
definitive 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
See; 0

More 0
than 0
just 0
federations; 0
a 0
multi-tier 0
system 0
of 0
control 0

Conference 0
of 0
monasteries 0
means 0
a 0
structure 0
of 0
communion 0
among 0
autonomous 1
monasteries, 0
belonging 0
to 0
diverse 0
Institutes 0
and 0
present 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
region... 0
in 0
particular 0
geographical 0
or 0
linguistic 0
contexts. 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
Benedictine 0
federations 0
of 0
a 0
given 0
area 0
will 0
form 0
a 0
“Conference” 0
with 0
Carmelite 0
federations 0
and 0
Dominican 0
federations 0
and 0
Poor 0
Clare 0
federations, 0
etc. 0

This 0
will 0
be 0
of 0
interest 0
to 0
Carmelite 0
houses 0
especially, 0
since 0
they 0
tend 0
to 0
be 0
generally 0
more 0
on 0
the 0
“conservative” 0
end 0
of 0
things. 0

Imagine 0
a 0
house 0
of 0
traditional 0
Carmelites 0
attending 0
regional 0
Conference 0
meetings 0
– 0
and 0
attempting 0
to 0
keep 0
up 0
their 0
Office 0
schedule 0
– 0
with 0
the 0
balloons-and-guitars, 0
break 0
dancing 0
Franciscans…What 0
fun! 0

And 0
finally, 0
just 0
in 0
case 0
one 0
entire 0
federation 0
decides 0
to 0
turn 0
back 0
the 0
clock, 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
an 0
umbrella 0
for 0
the 0
umbrellas; 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
watchers 0

Confederation 0
means 0
a 0
structure 0
of 0
connection 0
among 0
Federations 0
of 0
monasteries, 0
erected 0
by 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
that 0
approves 0
the 0
Statutes, 0
for 0
the 0
study 0
of 0
themes 0
relative 0
to 0
contemplative 0
life 0
in 0
relation 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
charism, 0
to 0
give 0
unitary 0
direction 0
and 0
a 0
certain 0
coordination 0
to 0
the 0
activity 0
of 0
the 0
individual 0
Federations. 0

Broad 0
powers 0

Federations 0
will 0
now 0
have 0
extremely 0
broad 0
powers 0
both 0
over 0
money 0
and 0
property 0
and, 0
crucially, 0
over 0
formation 0
of 0
nuns. 0

It 0
is 0
the 0
Federation 0
that 0
now 0
has 0
the 0
power 0
to 0
monitor 0
for 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
rules, 0
to 0
report 0
non-compliance 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See, 0
to 0
make 0
new 0
foundations 0
and, 0
apparently, 0
to 0
“encourage” 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
to 0
“communicate” 0
their 0
goods. 0

The 0
legitimately 0
established 0
Federation 0
is 0
a 0
public 0
juridic 0
person 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
is 0
therefore 0
able 0
to 0
acquire, 0
possess, 0
administer, 0
and 0
alienate 0
temporal, 0
movable 0
and 0
immovable 0
goods, 0
which 0
are 0
ecclesiastical 0
assets, 0
in 0
accordance 0
with 0
the 0
universal 0
and 0
proper 0
law. 0

To 0
keep 0
alive 0
and 0
strengthen 0
the 0
union 0
of 0
monasteries, 0
implementing 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
aims 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
a 0
certain 0
communication 0
of 0
goods 0
is 0
encouraged 0
among 0
the 0
monasteries, 0
coordinated 0
by 0
the 0
Federal 0
President. 0

The 0
communication 0
of 0
goods 0
in 0
a 0
Federation 0
is 0
implemented 0
through 0
contributions, 0
gifts, 0
loans 0
that 0
monasteries 0
offer 0
other 0
monasteries 0
that 0
have 0
financial 0
difficulties, 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
common 0
needs 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

The 0
Federation 0
considers 0
the 0
assets 0
in 0
its 0
possession 0
as 0
necessary 0
and 0
useful 0
means 0
to 0
achieve 0
its 0
goals. 0

Financial 0
incentives 0

Given 0
that 0
we 0
shall 0
see 0
below 0
that 0
the 0
provisions 0
for 0
suppression 0
of 0
monasteries 0
include 0
vague 0
and 0
indefinable 0
qualities 0
like 0
“vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism” 0
and 0
“dynamic 0
fidelity” 0
to 0
the 0
order’s 0
charism, 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
goods 0
of 0
extinct 0
monasteries 0
will 0
be 0
assumed 0
by 0
the 0
federation, 0
one 0
might 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
asking 0
if 0
this 0
creates 0
an 0
incentive 0
to 0
see 0
to 0
it 0
that 0
certain 0
houses 0
go 0
extinct[8]. 0

Since 0
the 0
document 0
provides 0
several 0
mechanisms 0
by 0
which 0
a 0
federation 0
can 0
move 0
nuns 0
out 0
of 0
a 0
monastery, 0
this 0
could 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
indelicate 0
questions 0
some 0
superiors 0
might 0
want 0
to 0
keep 0
in 0
mind. 0

Article 0
94 0
requires 0
that 0
once 0
it 0
is 0
canonically 0
erected 0
the 0
federation 0
is 0
to 0
seek 0
“legal 0
recognition 0
also 0
in 0
the 0
civil 0
sphere.” 0
This, 0
presumably, 0
will 0
bear 0
upon 0
legal 0
disputes 0
in 0
civil 0
courts 0
over 0
the 0
property 0
of 0
suppressed 0
monasteries. 0

extinct: 0

In 0
the 0

of 0
a 0
totally 0
extinct 0

when 0

in 0
compliance 0
with 0

go 0
to 0
the 0
respective 0

juridical 0

that 0
is, 0
to 0
the 0

to 0
another 0
structure 0

by 0

by 0

deriving 0
from 0
the 0

in 0

The 0
Federation 0
President, 0
in 0
particular, 0
watches 0
over 0
initial 0
and 0
ongoing 0
formation 0
in 0
the 0
monasteries 0
to 0
see 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
conformity 0
with 0
the 0
charism 0
proper 0
to 0
the 0
Institute, 0
so 0
that 0
every 0
community 0
may 0
be 0
a 0
beacon 0
that 0
illumines 0
the 0
journey 0
of 0
the 0
men 0
and 0
women 0
of 0
our 0
time. 0

At 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
visit, 0
she 0
will 0
inform 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
about 0
the 0
real 0
possibilities 0
that 0
the 0
monastery 0
has 0
or 0
does 0
not 0
have 0
of 0
guaranteeing 0
initial 0
formation. 0

The 0
formation 0
of 0
the 0
formators 0
and 0
their 0
collaborators 0
is 0
entrusted 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
the 0
monasteries 0
and 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
the 0
Federation, 0
therefore, 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
is 0
called 0
to 0
strengthen 0
formation 0
at 0
the 0
federal 0
level 0
and 0
to 0
require 0
the 0
participation 0
of 0
those 0
who 0
exercise 0
the 0
service 0
of 0
formation; 0
if 0
this 0
does 0
not 0
happen, 0
she 0
will 0
refer 0
the 0
matter 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

The 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
having 0
heard 0
the 0
opinion 0
of 0
the 0
Federal 0
Council, 0
chooses 0
the 0
most 0
appropriate 0
places 0
to 0
hold 0
the 0
specific 0
formative 0
courses 0
for 0
the 0
formators 0
and 0
their 0
collaborators, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
called 0
to 0
exercise 0
the 0
service 0
of 0
authority, 0
establishing 0
the 0
duration 0
of 0
these 0

in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
detrimental 0
to 0
the 0
needs 0
of 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
and 0
of 0
the 0

Who 0
makes 0
new 0
foundations 0
and 0
why? 0

Throughout 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
prerogative 0
of 0
bishops 0
to 0
establish 0
houses 0
of 0
contemplatives 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
dioceses. 0

Now, 0
with 0
the 0
pope 0
having 0
forbidden 0
bishops 0
to 0
exercise 0
this 0
ancient 0
right, 0
according 0
to 0
this 0
document, 0
the 0
federations 0
themselves 0
can 0
make 0
foundations. 0

goods 0
of 0
the 0
monastery. 0

c) 0
Rooms 0
adapted 0
to 0
the 0
lifestyle 0
of 0
the 0
community, 0
to 0
ensure 0
that 0
the 0
nuns 0
can 0
regularly 0
lead 0
the 0
contemplative 0
life 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
nature 0
and 0
spirit 0
of 0
their 0
Institute. 0

d) 0
Economic 0
conditions 0
that 0
guarantee 0
the 0
community 0
itself 0
can 0
provide 0
for 0
the 0
needs 0
of 0
daily 0
life. 0

One 0
of 0
these 0
things 0
is 0
not 0
like 0
the 0
others. 0

Did 0
you 0
notice? 0

One 0
criterion 0
stands 0
out 0
as 0
indeterminate, 0
vague, 0
compared 0
with 0
the 0
other 0
concrete 0
and 0
measurable 0
standards. 0

One 0
aspect 0
of 0
legislative 0
analysis 0
that 0
I 0
learned 0
early 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
terms 0
used 0
are 0
of 0
utmost 0
importance. 0

If 0
a 0
term 0
is 0
vague 0
or 0
is 0
defined 0
incorrectly 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
“loophole”. 0

Or 0
it 0
could 0
perhaps 0
be 0
described 0
as 0
a 0
handle; 0
a 0
place 0
where 0
a 0
person 0
who 0
wants 0
to 0
effect 0
a 0
particular 0
outcome 0
can 0
grasp 0
a 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation 0
to 0
use 0
it 0
like 0
an 0
axe. 0

So, 0
how, 0
exactly, 0
is 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
determined 0
– 0
and 0
by 0
whom 0
– 0
that 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
nuns 0
possess 0
“the 0
necessary 0
vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism”? 0

What, 0
precisely, 0
does 0
the 0
term 0
“vitality” 0
mean 0
and 0
exactly 0
how 0
is 0
one 0
to 0
measure 0
out 0
how 0
much 0
is 0
required? 0

Is 0
this 0
one 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
little 0
personal, 0
secret 0
expressions 0
of 0
which 0
only 0
he 0
knows 0
the 0
meaning? 0

Like 0
the 0
secret 0
to 0
how 0
nuns 0
are 0
to 0
smile 0
properly? 0

Does 0
the 0
inclusion 0
of 0
completely 0
subjective 0
criteria 0
belong 0
in 0
a 0
juridical 0
document? 0

Or 0
is 0
it 0
in 0
there 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
provide 0
cover 0
for 0
prelates? 0

The 0
next 0
article 0
tells 0
us, 0
“It 0
is 0
the 0
responsibility 0
of 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
these 0
requisites.” 0
Do 0
they 0
have 0
an 0
electronic 0
meter 0
in 0
a 0
cupboard 0
in 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious 0
that 0
measures 0
“charism 0
vitality”? 0

It 0
seems 0
important 0
to 0
ask 0
because 0
article 0
70, 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
suppress 0
a 0
monastery, 0
includes 0
it: 0

Among 0
the 0
criteria 0
that 0
can 0
contribute 0
to 0
determine 0
a 0
judgment 0
concerning 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
a 0
monastery, 0
after 0
having 0
examined 0
all 0
the 0
circumstances, 0
the 0
following 0
points 0
should 0
be 0
considered 0
as 0
a 0
whole: 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
nuns, 0
the 0
advanced 0
age 0
of 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
members, 0
the 0
real 0
capacity 0
for 0
government 0
and 0
formation, 0
lack 0
of 0
candidates 0
for 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
years, 0
lack 0
of 0
the 0
necessary 0
vitality 0
in 0
living 0
and 0
transmitting 0
the 0
charism 0
in 0
dynamic 0
fidelity[10]. 0

You 0
will 0
be 0
affiliated; 0
resistance 0
is 0
futile… 0

It 0
seems 0
there 0
are 0
two 0
themes 0
running 0
through 0
the 0
document: 0
to 0
establish 0
a 0
certain 0
value 0
of 0
“autonomy” 1
as 0
the 0
indispensable 0
criterion 0
for 0
viability, 0
while 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
asserting 0
top-down 0
oversight 0
and 0
control 0
over 0
who 0
gets 0
to 0
make 0
this 0
determination. 0

In 0
short, 0
a 0
monastery 0
must 0
be 0
autonomous, 1
but 0
heaven 0
help 0
the 0
community 0
that 0
asserts 0
its 0
independence. 0

Articles 0
54-64 0
offer 0
an 0
interim 0
measure 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
“incapacity” 0
that 0
is 0
really 0
just 0
more 0
of 0
the 0
second 0
thing. 0

Once 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
autonomy 1
has 0
been 0
established… 0

54 0
Affiliation 0
is 0
a 0
particular 0
form 0
of 0
help 0
that 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
establishes 0
in 0
particular 0
situations 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
the 0
community 0
of 0
a 0
monastery 0
sui 0
juris 0
which 0
has 0
only 0
an 0
asserted 0
autonomy, 0
but 0
in 0
reality, 0
very 0
precarious 0
or, 0
in 0
fact, 0
non-existent. 0

55 0
Affiliation 0
is 0
configured 0
as 0
a 0
juridical 0
support 0
that 0
must 0
assess 0
whether 0
the 0
inability 0
to 0
manage 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
autonomous 1
monastery 0
in 0
all 0
its 0
dimensions 0
is 0
only 0
temporary 0
or 0
is 0
irreversible, 0
helping 0
the 0
community 0
of 0
the 0
affiliated 0
monastery 0
to 0
overcome 0
difficulties 0
or 0
to 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
what 0
is 0
necessary 0
to 0
bring 0
about 0
the 0
suppression 0
of 0
this 0
monastery. 0

How 0
does 0
affiliation 0
work? 0

Well, 0
the 0
federation 0
and 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
between 0
them 0
work 0
it 0
out: 0

In 0
these 0
cases, 0
it 0
is 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
opportunity 0
of 0
setting 0
up 0
an 0
ad 0
hoc 0
commission 0
formed 0
by 0
the 0
Ordinary, 0
the 0
Federation 0
President, 0
the 0
Federal 0
Assistant, 0
and 0
the 0
Major 0
Superior 0
of 0
the 0
monastery 0

It’s 0
starting 0
to 0
be 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
federation 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
little 0
more 0
than 0
the 0
Big 1
Brother 1
hit-squad 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious. 0

It’s 0
worth 0
remembering 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
German 0
men’s 0
monastery 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
superior 0
tried 0
to 0
return 0
the 0
community 0
to 0
pre-Vatican 0
II 0
practices. 0

Mariawald 0
Trappist 0
monastery 0
– 0
900 0
years 0
old 0
– 0
was 0
finally 0
dissolved, 0
affiliated 0
to 0
death. 0

Its 0
superior 0
had 0
made 0
the 0
fatal 1
error 0
of 0
openly 0
declaring 0
– 0
in 0
2008, 0
after 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
Summorum 0
Pontificum 0
– 0
that 0
the 0
monastery’s 0
problems 0
all 0
began 0
when 0
it 0
adopted 0
the 0
new 0
liturgical 0
rites 0
and 0
implemented 0
the 0
trends 0
of 0
all 0
religious 0
after 0
Vatican 0
II, 0
and 0
that 0
clearly 0
the 0
solution 0
was 0
to 0
go 0
back 0
to 0
pre-conciliar 0
ways. 0

Mariawald 0
was 0
consequently 0
affiliated, 0
in 0
the 0
manner 0
this 0
document 0
describes, 0
with 0
a 0
liberal 0
house 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
whose 0
superior, 0
unsurprisingly, 0
discovered 0
that 0
the 0
house 0
was 0
hopelessly 0
divided 0
and 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
saved. 0

What 0
would 0
make 0
forced 0
affiliation 0
a 0
truly 1
devastating 1
weapon 0
against 0
conservative 0
or 0
traditional 0
communities 0
is 0
the 0
proviso 0
that 0
an 0
affiliated 0
monastery 0
may 0
not 0
form 0
its 0
own 0
novices: 0

60 0
The 0
affiliated 0
monastery 0
can 0
accept 0
candidates, 0
but 0
the 0
novitiate 0
and 0
initial 0
formation 0
must 0
be 0
performed 0
in 0
the 0
affiliating 0
monastery 0
or 0
in 0
another 0
monastery 0
established 0
by 0
the 0
Federation.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
this 0
means 0
it 0
is 0
the 0
affiliating 0
monastery’s 0
formation 0
team 0
that 0
would 0
make 0
the 0
determination 0
to 0
dismiss 0
recalcitrant, 0
“neo-pelagian” 0
postulants 0
and 0
novices. 0

This 0
brings 0
us 0
to 0
about 0
article 0
155 0
of 0
the 0
document. 0

Part 0
two 0
to 0
come. 0

_______________ 0

[1] 0
It 0
would 0
seem, 0
therefore, 0
that 0
a 0
useful 0
task 0
for 0
someone 0
writing 0
about 0
what 0
this 0
pope 0
intends 0
for 0
nuns 0
would 0
be 0
to 0
read 0
Sponsa 0
Christi 0
Ecclesia 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
Francis’ 0
Apostolic 0
Constitution 0
and 0
make 0
a 0
careful 0
comparison. 0

I’m 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
that 0
here, 0
but 0
it 0
might 0
be 0
helpful 0
to 0
examine 0
the 0
two 0
documents 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
a 0
expert 0
at 0
some 0
point. 0

[2] 0
Worth 0
remembering, 0
however, 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
Benedict 0
the 0
“conservative,” 0
not 0
Francis, 0
who 0
appointed 0
Braz 0
de’ 0
Aviz 0
in 0
the 0
office 0
to 0
replace 0
Cardinal 0
Rode 0
– 0
presumably 0
under 0
that 0
good 0
old 0
“conservative” 0
rubric 0
of 0
the 0
“big 0
umbrella” 0
– 0
under 0
whom 0
these 0
culpably 0
belated 0
attempts 0
to 0
save 0
US 0
religious 0
life 0
were 0
started. 0

[3] 0
Just 0
considering 0
the 0
numbers 0
of 0
course. 0

Leaving 0
alone 0
the 0
doctrinal 0
issues. 0

[4] 0
“The 0
same 0
Institute” 0
means 0
the 0
order 0
in 0
question, 0
whether 0
Benedictine, 0
Dominican, 0
Carmelite 0
etc. 0

[5] 0
I’d 0
love 0
to 0
hear 0
from 0
some 0
monastic 0
superior 0
who 0
had 0
the 0
nerve 0
to 0
tell 0
Rome, 0
“Actually, 0
given 0
that 0
all 0
our 0
neighbours 0
in 0
religion 0
are 0
raging 0
neo-modernist 0
heretics, 0
if 0
not 0
schismatics, 0
we 0
think 0
‘isolation’ 0
is 0
a 0
desirable 0
thing 0
– 0
like 0
quarantine 0
during 0
an 0
outbreak 0
of 0
Bubonic 0
Plague 0
– 0
and 0
would 0
therefore 0
like 0
to 0
be 0
dispensed 0
from 0
the 0
federation 0
requirement.” 0
I’d 0
pay 0
good 0
money 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
shade 0
of 0
purple 0
the 0
well-fed 1
Braz 0
de’Aviz 0
turned. 0

[6] 0
“justice 0
and 0
beneficence” 0
are 0
considered 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
the 0
community, 0
not 0
the 0
patient 0

[7] 0
Bioethicists 0
take 0
it 0
as 0
read 0
that 0
in 0
order 0
for 0
a 0
life 0
to 0
have 0
sufficient 0
“quality” 0
it 0
must 0
demonstrate 0
sufficient 0
autonomy. 0

Dependence 0
upon 0
the 0
care 0
of 0
others 0
is, 0
quite 1
literally, 1
a 0
capital 0
offence. 0

[8] 0
Readers 0
may 0
think 0
I’m 0
exaggerating 0
the 0
danger 0
of 0
material 0
motivations 0
for 0
suppressing 0
monasteries, 0
but 0
as 0
we 0
will 0
see, 0
the 0
distinction 0
between 0
the 0
federations 0
and 0
the 0
Holy 0
See 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
paperwork 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
well 0
to 0
recall 0
that 0
the 0
secretary 0
for 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious, 0
Jose 0
Rodrigues 0
Carballo, 0
was 0
a 0
person 0
of 0
interest 0
to 0
international 0
police 0
agencies 0
for 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
“tens 0
of 0
millions” 0
of 0
Euros 0
from 0
the 0
coffers 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
Minor, 0
the 0
original 0
Franciscan 0
order 0
of 0
which 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
the 0
head. 0

Shortly 0
after 0
Carballo’s 0
appointment, 0
it 0
was 0
revealed 0
that 0
the 0
Swiss 0
prosecutor’s 0
office 0
was 0
investigating 0
the 0
money 0
missing 0
from 0
the 0
Friars 0
Minor 0
in 0
connection 0
with 0
drugs, 0
money 0
laundering 0
operations 0
and 0
gun 0
running. 0

Carballo 0
was 0
Francis’ 0
very 0
first 0
appointment, 0
April 0
6, 0
2013, 0
three 0
weeks 0
after 0
the 0
Conclave 0
and 0
it 0
was 0
to 0
him 0
that 0
the 0
pope 0
gave 0
the 0
task 0
of 0
the 0
destruction 0
of 0
the 0
FFIs, 0
and 0
a 0
major 0
part 0
of 0
that 0
operation 0
was 0
to 0
separate 0
the 0
FFIs 0
from 0
real 0
assets 0
valued 0
at 0
about 0
30 0
million 0
Euros. 0

[9] 0
So 0
much 0
for 0
the 0
principle 0
of 0
subsidiarity. 0

I 0
can 0
imagine 0
what 0
a 0
monastery 0
founded 0
by 0
a 0
committee 0
would 0
be 0
like 0
to 0
live 0
in. 0

[10] 0
We’ll 0
pass 0
over 0
“dynamic 1
fidelity” 1
in 0
silence 0
for 0
now… 0

World 0

BUDAPEST, 0
Hungary, 0
February 0
19, 0
2018 0
(LifeSiteNews) 0
– 0
Brushing 0
aside 0
any 0
semblance 0
of 0
political 0
correctness, 0
Hungary’s 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
said 0
in 0
his 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
nation 0
speech 0
on 0
Sunday 0
that, 0
“Christianity 1
is 1
Europe's 1
last 1
hope.” 1

Addressing 0
his 0
country 0
and 0
the 0
world, 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Viktor 0
Orbán 0
warned 0
that 0
European 1
nations 1
which 1
have 1
encouraged 1
migration 1
have, 1
“opened 1
the 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
decline 1
of 1
Christian 1
culture 1
and 1
the 1
advance 1
of 1
Islam.” 1

Orbán 0
painted 0
an 0
image 0
of 0
Western 0
Europe 0
being 0
overwhelmed 0
by 0
the 0
accelerating 0
influx 0
Muslim 0
immigrants 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

“According 0
to 0
estimates, 0
the 0
proportion 0
of 0
immigrants 0
will 0
grow 0
at 0
an 0
accelerated 0
pace 0
in 0
the 0
European 0
countries 0
west 0
of 0
us,” 0
said 0
Orbán. 0

“I 0
won't 0
even 0
say 0
anything 0
about 0
France 0
and 0
Holland, 0
but 0
even 0
the 0
born 0
Germans 0
are 0
being 0
forced 0
back 0
from 0
most 0
large 0
German 0
cities 0
as 0
migrants 0
always 0
occupy 0
big 0
cities 0
first.” 0

Orbán 0
warned 0
that 0
as 0
Western 1
Europe 1
becomes 1
saturated 1
with 1
Muslim 1
occupants, 1
Islamists 1
would 1
soon 1
seek 1
to 1
stream 1
in 1
to 1
his 1
country 1
from 1
both 1
Western 1
Europe 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
from 1
Islamic 1
nations. 1

“This 0
means 0
that 0
the 1
Islamic 1
civilization, 1
which 1
always 1
considers 1
its 1
vocation 1
to 1
convert 1
Europe 1
to 1
what 1
it 1
calls 1
the 1
true 1
faith, 1
in 0
the 0
future 0
will 0
be 0
knocking 0
on 0
the 0
door 0
of 0
Central 0
Europe 0
not 0
only 0
from 0
the 0
south, 0
but 0
from 0
the 0
west, 0
as 0
well,” 0
he 0
said. 0

Prime 0
Minister 0
Orbán 0
said 0
his 0
government 0
will 0
oppose 0
efforts 0
by 0
the 0
United 0

In 0
June, 0
LifeSiteNews 0
reported 0
that 0
Orbán 0
had 0
taken 0
a 0
strong 0
stand 0
and 0
not 0
backed 0
down 0
against 0
outside 0

influences 0
seeking 0
to 0
control 0
his 0
nation’s 0
politics. 0

Billionaire 0
George 0
Soros, 0
who 0
famously 0
backs 0
many 0
progressive 0
initiatives 0
around 0
the 0
world, 0
locked 0
horns 0
with 0
Orbán 0
over 0
the 0
Central 0
European 0
University 0
(CEU) 0
he 0
founded 0
in 0
1989, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
criticized 0
as 0
a 1
funnel 1
for 1
anti-nationalist 1
views. 1

Orbán 0
and 0
Soros 0
have 0
a 0
history, 0
beginning 0
in 0
partnership 0
and 0
ending 0
in 0
acrimony. 0

Orbán 0
started 0
public 0
life 0
as 0
a 0
crusader 0
against 0
communism 0
and 0
attended 0
Oxford 0
University 0
on 0
a 0
Soros 0
scholarship. 0

Soros, 0
who 0
expatriated 0
from 0
Hungary, 0
also 0
funded 0
Orbán’s 0
political 0
organization, 0
the 0
Alliance 0
for 0
Young 0
Democrats. 0

But 0
Orbán’s 0
defense 0
of 0
conservative 0
values 0
has 0
led 0
to 0
breaking 0
ties 0
with 0
Soros, 0
whom 0
he 0
now 0
criticizes 0
as 0
a 0
foreigner 1
meddling 1
in 1
his 1
country’s 1
affairs. 1

After 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Orbán 0
delivered 0
his 0
strongly 0
worded 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
nation 0
speech, 0
a 0
UK 0
Daily 0
Mail 0
report 0
said, 0
“Orbán 0
has 0
conflated 0
the 0
issue 0
of 0
immigration 0
with 0
the 0
image 0
of 0
Soros, 1
87, 1
whose 1
name 1
was 1
used 1
in 1
a 1
tough 1
anti-migrant 1
bill 1
sent 0
to 0
Parliament 0
on 0
Wednesday.” 0

The 0
Daily 0
Mail 0
report 0
continued: 0

Soros, 0
for 0
his 0
part, 0
compared 1
Orbán 1
unfavourably 1
to 1
both 1
the 1
Nazis 1
and 1
the 1
Communists, 1
saying 0
his 0
rule 0
evoked 0
dark 0
tones 0
from 0
the 0
1930's, 0
when 0
Hungary 0
was 0
allied 0
with 0
Nazi 0
Germany. 0

But 0
Orbán 0
remains 0
committed 0
to 0
his 0
policy, 0
claiming 0
that 0
Soros 0
and 0
supporters 0
of 0
migration 0
are 0
losing 0
the 0
fight. 0

He 0
said: 0
“Soros 0
has 0
antagonised 0
not 0
only 0
us 0
but 0
also 0
England, 0
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
Israel 0
too. 0

Everywhere 0
he 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
migration 0
accepted. 0

It 0
won't 0
work. 0

We 0
are 0
not 0
alone 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
fight 0
together 0
and 0
we 0
will 0
succeed.” 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
inviting 0
Soros’ 0
ire, 0
Orbán 0
came 0
under 0
fire 0
a 0
couple 0
years 0
ago 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
State 0
Department 0
under 0
President 0
Obama 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
the 0
European 0
Parliament 0
for 0
purportedly 0
discriminating 0
against 0
homosexuals 0
because 0
of 0
Hungary’s 0
insistence 0
on 0
defining 0
marriage 0
between 0
a 0
man 0
and 0
a 0
woman, 0
and 0
that 0
pre-born 0
babies 0
have 0
rights. 0

Last 0
year, 0
Orbán 0
also 0
criticized 0
liberals 0
and 0
encouraged 0
citizens 0
to 0
give 0
life 0
to 0
more 0
children 0
during 0
the 0
11th 0
conference 0
of 0
the 0
World 0

Three 0
thousand 0

who 0
attended 0
the 0
four-day 0

Orbán 0
in 0

lambaste 0
the 0

The 1

government 1
of 1

to 1
churn 1
out 1
its 1
production 1
line 1
of 1
fake 1
documents 1

Luke 1

Amazingly, 0
more 0
Ecuadorean 0
Government 0
documents 0
have 0
just 0
been 0
discovered 0
for 0
the 0
Guardian, 0
this 0
time 0
spy 0
agency 0
reports 0
detailing 0
visits 0
of 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
and 0
unspecified 1
“Russians” 1
to 0
the 0
Embassy. 0

By 1
a 1
wonderful 1
coincidence 1
of 1
timing, 1
this 0
is 0
the 0
day 0
after 0
Mueller 0
announced 0
that 0
Manafort’s 0
plea 0
deal 0
was 0
over. 0

The 0
problem 0
with 0
this 0
latest 0
fabrication 0
is 0
that 0
Moreno 0
had 0
already 0
released 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs 0
to 0
the 0
Mueller 0
inquiry. 0

Neither 0
Manafort 0
nor 0
these 0
“Russians” 1
are 0
in 0
the 0
visitor 0
logs. 0

This 0
is 0
impossible. 0

The 0
visitor 0
logs 0
were 0
not 0
kept 0
by 0
Wikileaks, 0
but 0
by 0
the 0
very 0
strict 0
Ecuadorean 0
security. 0

Nobody 0
was 0
ever 0
admitted 0
without 0
being 0
entered 0
in 0
the 0
logs. 0

The 0
procedure 0
was 0
very 0
thorough. 0

To 0
go 0
in, 0
you 0
had 0
to 0
submit 0
your 0
passport 0
(no 0
other 0
type 0
of 0
document 0
was 0
accepted). 0

A 0
copy 0
of 0
your 0
passport 0
was 0
taken 0
and 0
the 0
passport 0
details 0
entered 0
into 0
the 0
log. 0

Your 0
passport, 0
along 0
with 0
your 0
mobile 0
phone 0
and 0
any 0
other 0
electronic 0
equipment, 0
was 0
retained 0
until 0
you 0
left, 0
along 0
with 0
your 0
bag 0
and 0
coat. 0

I 0
feature 0
in 0
the 0
logs 0
every 0
time 0
I 0
visited. 0

There 0
were 0
no 0
exceptions. 0

For 0
an 0
exception 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
for 0
Manafort 0
and 0
the 1
“Russians” 1
would 0
have 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
decision 0
of 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
Ecuador, 0
not 0
of 0
Wikileaks, 0
and 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
so 0
exceptional 0
the 0
reason 0
for 0
it 0
would 0
surely 0
have 0
been 0
noted 0
in 0
the 0
now 0
leaked 0
supposed 0
Ecuadorean 0
“intelligence 0
report” 0
of 0
the 0
visits. 0

What 0
possible 0
motive 0
would 0
the 0
Ecuadorean 0
government 0
have 0
for 0
facilitating 0
secret 0
unrecorded 0
visits 0
by 0
Paul 0
Manafort? 0

Furthermore 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
that 0
the 0
intelligence 0
agency 0
– 0
who 0
were 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
the 0
security 0
– 0
would 0
not 0
know 0
the 0
identity 0
of 0
these 0
alleged 0
“Russians”. 1

Previously 1
Harding 1
and 1
the 1
Guardian 1
have 1
published 1
documents 1
faked 1
by 1
the 1
Moreno 1
government 1
regarding 1
a 1
diplomatic 1
appointment 1
to 1
Russia 1
for 1
Assange 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
had 1
no 1
knowledge. 1

Now 1
they 1
follow 1
this 1
up 1
with 1
more 1
documents 1
aimed 1
to 1
provide 1
fictitious 1
evidence 1
to 1
bolster 1
Mueller’s 1
pathetically 1
failed 1
attempt 1
to 1
substantiate 1
the 1
story 1
that 1
Russia 1
deprived 1
Hillary 1
of 1
the 1
Presidency. 1

My 0
friend 0
William 0
Binney, 0
probably 1
the 1
world’s 1
greatest 1
expert 1
on 1
electronic 1
surveillance, 1
former 0
Technical 0
Director 0
of 0
the 0
NSA, 0
has 0
stated 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
impossible 0
the 0
DNC 0
servers 0
were 0
hacked, 0
the 0
technical 0
evidence 0
shows 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
download 0
to 0
a 0
directly 0
connected 0
memory 0
stick. 0

I 1
knew 1
the 1
US 1
security 1
services 1
were 1
conducting 1
a 1
fake 1
investigation 1
the 1
moment 1
it 1
became 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
FBI 1
did 1
not 1
even 1
themselves 1
look 1
at 1
the 1
DNC 1
servers, 1
instead 1
accepting 1
a 1
report 1
from 1
the 1
Clinton 1
linked 1
DNC 1
“security 1
consultants” 1
Crowdstrike. 1

I 0
would 0
love 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
fact 0
Julian 0
has 0
never 0
met 0
Manafort 0
is 0
bound 0
to 0
be 0
established. 0

But 1
I 1
fear 1
that 1
state 1
control 1
of 1
propaganda 1
may 1
be 1
such 1
that 1
this 1
massive 1
“Big 1
Lie” 1
will 1
come 1
to 1
enter 1
public 1
consciousness 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
as 1
the 1
non-existent 1
Russian 1
hack 1
of 1
the 1
DNC 1
servers. 1

Assange 1
never 1
met 1
Manafort. 1

The 1
DNC 1
emails 1
were 1
downloaded 1
by 1
an 1
insider. 1

Assange 1
never 1
even 1
considered 1
fleeing 1
to 1
Russia. 1

Those 1
are 1
the 1
facts, 1
and 1
I 1
am 1
in 1
a 1
position 1
to 1
give 1
you 1
a 1
personal 1
assurance 1
of 1
them. 1

I 1
can 1
also 1
assure 1
you 1
that 1
Luke 1
Harding, 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
Washington 1
Post 1
and 1
New 1
York 1
Times 1
have 1
been 1
publishing 1
a 1
stream 1
of 1
deliberate 1
lies, 1
in 1
collusion 1
with 1
the 1
security 1
services. 1

I 0
am 0
not 0
a 0
fan 0
of 0
Donald 0
Trump. 0

But 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
partisans 1
of 1
the 1
defeated 1
candidate 1
(and 1
a 1
particularly 1
obnoxious 1
defeated 1
candidate) 1
manipulate 1
the 1
security 1
services 1
and 1
the 1
media 1
to 1
create 1
an 1
entirely 1
false 1
public 1
perception, 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
attempt 1
to 1
overturn 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
US 1
Presidential 1
election, 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
astonishing 1
thing 1
I 1
have 1
witnessed 1
in 1
my 1
lifetime. 1

Plainly 1
the 1
government 1
of 1
Ecuador 1
is 1
releasing 1
lies 1
about 1
Assange 1
to 1
curry 1
favour 1
with 1
the 1
security 1
establishment 1
of 1
the 1
USA 1
and 1
UK, 1
and 1
to 1
damage 1
Assange’s 1
support 1
prior 1
to 1
expelling 1
him 1
from 1
the 1
Embassy. 1

He 1
will 1
then 1
be 1
extradited 1
from 1
London 1
to 1
the 1
USA 1
on 1
charges 1
of 1
espionage. 1

Assange 0
is 0
not 0
a 1
whistleblower 1
or 1
a 1
spy 1
– 0
he 0
is 0
the 1
greatest 1
publisher 1
of 1
his 1
age, 1
and 1
has 1
done 1
more 1
to 1
bring 1
the 1
crimes 1
of 1
governments 1
to 1
light 1
than 1
the 1
mainstream 1
media 1
will 1
ever 1
be 1
motivated 1
to 1
achieve. 1

That 1
supposedly 1
great 1
newspaper 1
titles 1
like 1
the 1
Guardian, 1
New 1
York 1
Times 1
and 1
Washington 1
Post 1
are 1
involved 1
in 1
the 1
spreading 1
of 1
lies 1
to 1
damage 1
Assange, 1
and 1
are 1
seeking 1
his 1
imprisonment 1
for 1
publishing 1
state 1
secrets, 1
is 1
clear 1
evidence 1
that 1
the 1
idea 1
of 1
the 1
“liberal 1
media” 1
no 1
longer 1
exists 1
in 1
the 1
new 1
plutocratic 1
age. 1

The 1

not 1

Murillo 0
wrote 0
at 0
the 0
outset 0
of 0
the 0
lengthy 0
message: 0

We 0
worked 0
very 0
hard. 0

Many 0
people 0
did. 0

We 0
pushed 0
tp 0
get 0
out 0
the 0
Latino 0
vote 0
with 0
our 0
features, 0
our 0
partners, 0
and 0
our 0
voices. 0

We 0
kept 0
our 0
Google 0
efforts 0
non-partisan 1
and 0
followed 0
our 0
company’s 0
protocols 0
for 0
the 0
elections 0
strategy. 0

We 0
emphasized 0
our 0
mission 0
to 0
give 0
Latinos 0
access 0
to 0
information 0
so 0
that 0
they 0
can 0
make 0
an 0
informed 0
decision 0
at 0
the 0
polls, 0
and 0
we 0
feel 0
very 0
grateful 0
for 0
all 0
the 0
support 0
to 0
do 0
this 0
important 0
work. 0

Latinos 0
voted 1
in 1
record-breaking 1
numbers, 1
particularly 0
with 0
early 0
votes. 0

A 0
large 0
percentage 0
of 0
Latino 0
voters 0
in 0
Florida 0
were 0
new 0
voters 0
who 0
had 0
become 0
citizens 0
just 0
in 0
time 0
to 0
vote. 0

We 0
saw 0
high 0
traffic 0
for 0
the 0
search 0
queries 0
‘votar,’ 0
‘como 0
votar,’ 0
and 0
‘donde 0
voter,’ 0
in 0
key 0
states 0
like 0
Florida 0
and 0
Nevada. 0

We 0
will 0
be 0
pulling 0
in 0
more 0
info 0
in 0
the 0
coming 0
hours/days 0
but 0
so 0
far 0
we 0
definitely 0
know 0
there 0
was 0
high 0
traffic 0
on 0
search 0
in 0
Spanish. 0

Without 0
translating 0
our 0
tools 0
the 0
users 0
wouldn’t 0
have 0
found 0
the 0
information 0
they 0
needed. 0

Objectively 0
speaking, 0
our 0
goal 0
was 0
met 0
— 0
we 0
pushed 0
and 0
successfully 0
launched 0
the 0
search 0

and 0
we 0
thank 0
Lisa 0

and 0
we 0
greatly 0

it. 0

Even 0
Sundar 0
gave 0
the 0
effort 0
a 0

a 0

in 0

compared 0
the 0

Dr. 1
Robert 1
Epstein, 1
a 1

and 1
an 1
expert 1
on 1
Google, 1
who 1
has 1
said, 1
in 1
Carlson’s 1
words, 1
“Google 1
alone 1
could 1
determine 1
the 1
outcome 1
of 1
almost 1
any 1
election 1
just 1
by 1
altering 1
its 1
search 1
selections 1
and 1
we 1
would 1
never 1
know 1
it.” 1

Epstein 0

published 0

detailing 0
how 0
Google 0
could 0
influence 0
the 0
results 0
of 0
U.S. 0

Breitbart 0
News 0
has 0
exclusively 0
published 0
several 0
of 0
Epstein’s 0
reports, 0
including 0
a 0
recent 0
one 0
showing 0
that 0
Google 0

huge 1
swaths 1
of 1

In 0
his 0

Carlson 0
then 0
described 0
the 0
emails 0
he 0
obtained, 0
which 0
Breitbart 0
News 0
also 0
obtained. 0

Carlson 0
said: 0

This 0
wasn’t 0
a 0
get-out-the-vote 1
effort 1
or 0
whatever 0
they 0
say. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
aimed 0
at 0
all 0
potential 0
voters. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
even 0
aimed 0
at 0
a 0
balanced 0
cross-section 0
of 0
subgroups. 0

Google 0
didn’t 0
try 0
to 0
get 0
out 0
the 0
vote 0
among 0
say 0
Christian 0
Arabs 0
in 0
Michigan 0
or 0
say 0
Persian 0
Jews 0
in 0
Los 0
Angeles—they 0
sometimes 0
vote 0
Republican. 0

It 0
was 0
aimed 0
only 0
at 0
one 0
group, 0
a 0
group 0
that 0
Google 0
cynically 1
assumed 1
would 0
vote 0
exclusively 0
for 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Party. 0

Furthermore, 0
this 0

targeted 0
not 0
only 0
the 0
entire 0
country 0
but 0
swing 0
states 0
vital 0
to 0
the 0
Hillary 0
campaign. 0

This 0
was 0
not 0
an 0
exercise 0
in 0
civics, 0
this 0
was 0
political 0
consulting. 0

It 0
was 0
in 0
effect 0
an 0
in-kind 0
contribution 0
to 0
the 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
campaign.” 0

Carlson 0
noted 0
that 0
in 0
communication 0
with 0
Google, 0
the 0
company 0
“did 0
not 0
deny 0
that 0
the 0
email 0
was 0
real 0
or 0
that 0
it 0
showed 0
a 0
clear 0
political 0
preference.” 0

“Their 0
only 0
defense 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
activities 0
they 0
described 0
were 0
either 0
non-partisan 1
or 0
were 0
not 0
officially 0
taken 0
by 0
the 0
company,” 0
Carlson 0
said 0
Monday 0
night, 0
describing 0
Google’s 0
official 0
response 0
to 0
his 0
requests 0
for 0
comment, 0
before 0
challenging 0
the 0
company’s 0
response: 0
“But 1
of 1
course 1
they 1
were 1
both. 1

Plenty 0
of 0
people 0
in 0
Google 0
knew 0
what 0
was 0
going 0
on 0
and 0
we 0
haven’t 0
seen 0
any 0
evidence 0
anyone 0
at 0
Google 0
disapproved 0

tried 1

it 1
in.” 1

The 0
email 0
from 0
Murillo 0
continues 0
by 0
explaining 0
just 0
how 0
expansive 0
the 0
efforts 0
the 0
company 0
undertook 0
to 0
achieve 0
its 0
objective 0
were: 0

We 0
had 0
our 0
partners 0
help 0
spread 0
the 0
word 0
about 0
our 0
features 0
on 0
social 0
media, 0

more. 0

We 0
promoted 0
our 0

the 1
Latino 1

Foundation’s 1
non-partisan 1

reach 0
to 0
hit 0
over 0
11M 0
impressions 0
with 0
that 0

We 0
hosted 0
an 0

with 0
over 0
200 0

a 0
hangout 0
with 0
social 1

about 0
the 0
power 0

the 0
Latino 0
vote 0
and 0
the 0
new 0
research 0
Nielsen 0
published 0
about 0
the 0
Latino 0
electorate. 0

This 0
reached 0
4.4M 0
social 0
media 0
impressions 0
and 0
signaled 0
to 0
many 0
that 0
Google 0
and 0
our 0
partners 0
value 0
the 0
Latino 0
community 0
and 0
our 0
role 0
in 0
this 0
election. 0

We 0
brought 0
the 0
same 0
research 0
to 0
the 0
LATISM 0
conference, 0
where 0
people 0
were 0
beyond 1
thrilled 1
to 0
see 0
Google’s 0
support 0
and 0
acknowledgment 0
of 0
the 0
Latino 0
community. 0

If 0
Murillo 0
had 0
ended 0
her 0
email 0
there, 0
this 0
probably 0
would 0
not 0
amount 0
to 0
the 0
level 0
of 0
a 0
national 0
news 0
story. 0

But 0
she 0
did 0
not: 0
She 0
went 0
on 0
for 0
another 0
several 0
paragraphs 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
page 0
and 0
an 0
extra 0
three 0
pages 0
to 0
admit 0
the 1
openly 1
partisan 1
intent 1
of 1
Google’s 1
actions, 1
including 0
a 0
remarkable 0
in-writing 0
confirmation 0
that 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
of 0
Google’s 0
actions 0
amounted 0
to 0
a 1
“silent 1
donation”—something 0
that 0
could 0
raise 0
Federal 0
Election 0
Commission 0
(FEC) 0
red 0
flags 0
if 0
authorities 0
decide 0
to 0
launch 0
an 0
official 0
investigation 0
into 0
this 0
matter, 0
now 0
that 0
these 0
emails 0
have 0
been 0
publicly 0
revealed. 0

It 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
paragraph 0
that 0
Murillo 0
openly 0
admits 0
that 0
Google 0
made 0
a 1
“silent 1
donation,” 1
in 0
her 0
words, 0
paying 0
for 0
rides 0
to 0
polls 0
via 0
leftist 1
organization 1
Voto 0
Latino. 0

Murillo 0
wrote 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
paragraph: 0

We 0
also 0
supported 0
partners 0
like 0
Voto 0
Latino 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
rides 0
to 0
the 0
polls 0
in 0
key 0
states 0
(silent 1
donation). 1

We 0
even 0
helped 0
them 0
create 0
ad 0
campaigns 0
to 0
promote 0
the 0
rides 0
(with 0
support 0
from 0
HOLA 0
folks 0
who 0
rallied 0

their 0

We 0

land 0
an 0

to 0

to 0

information 0
about 0
how 0
to 0
vote. 0

They 0
were 0
a 0
strong 0
partner, 0
among 0
many 0
in 0
this 0
effort. 0

The 0
next 0
paragraph 0
is 0
where 0
Murillo 0
begins 0
to 0
make 0
her 0
next 0
major 0
admission: 0
that 0
the 0
effort 0
was 0
not 0
just 0
to 0
increase 0
voter 0
turnout 0
generally 0
but 0
to 0
elect 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
over 0
Donald 0
Trump. 0

“Ultimately, 0
after 0
all 0
was 0
said 0
and 0
done, 0
the 0
Latino 0
community 0
did 0
come 0
out 0
to 0
vote, 0
and 0
completely 0
surprised 0
us,” 0
Murillo 0
wrote. 0

“We 0
never 0
anticipated 0
that 0
29% 0
of 0
Latinos 0
would 0
vote 0
for 0
Trump. 0

No 1
one 1
did. 1

We 0
saw 0
headlines 0
like 0
this 0
about 0
early 0
voter 0
turn 0
out 0
and 0
thought 0
that 0
this 1
was 1
finally 1
the 1
year 1
that 1
the 1
‘sleeping 1
giant’ 1
had 1
awoken.” 1

On 0
the 0
next 0
page, 0
the 0
email 0
continues 0
with 0
a 0
headline 0
from 0
an 0

in 0
The 0
Atlantic 0
by 0
James 0
Fallows: 0
“2016: 0

Under 0

from 0
Jon 0
Ralston 0
of 0

Reports 0
in 0
Nevada 0
saying, 0
among 0
other 0
things, 0
that 0
“Trump 1
is 1
dead” 1
because 0
of 0
Latino 0
turnout 0
in 0
early 0
voting 0
in 0
the 0
state. 0

Trump 0
did 0
not 0
end 0
up 0
winning 0
Nevada 0
in 0
the 0
end, 0
but 0
he 0
did 0
beat 0
Clinton 0
in 0
30 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
other 0
states. 0

… 0

At 0
that 0
point, 0
after 0
the 0
Ralston 0
tweet, 0
Murillo 0
openly 0
admits 0
the 0
partisan 1
motives 1
of 0
Google’s 0
electioneering 0
efforts. 0

“On 0
personal 0
note, 0
we 0
really 0
thought 0
we 0
had 0
shown 0
up 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
our 0
political 0
power 0
against 0
a 0

who 0
had 0
vehemently 1
offended 1
our 0

Murillo 0
wrote. 0

“We 0

did 0
it!” 0

Murillo’s 0

from 0

Benjamin 0
Wallace-Wells: 0
“Latino 1

was 0
written 0
on 0
Nov. 0
7, 0
2016, 0
the 0
day 0
before 0
the 0

Then 0
she 0
begins 0
writing 0
again: 0
“But 0
then 0
reality 0
set 0
in. 0

Only 0
71% 0

that 0

In 1

again 1
openly 1
admits 1
she 1
was 1
not 1
“objective” 1
when 1
it 1
came 1
to 1
the 1

“I 0
have 0

I 0
ask 0
that 0
you 0
please 0
give 0
us 0
some 0
time 0

pause 0

Murillo 0
wrote. 0

“This 1
is 1
devastating 1
for 0
our 0

After 0

what 0
we 0
thought 0

the 0

are 0
not 0
what 0
we 0

are 0

As 0
a 0
reminder, 0
in 0
late 0
October 0
of 0
2016 0
it 0
was 0
revealed 0
that 0
just 0
days 0
prior 0
to 0
the 0
April 0
15, 0
2014 0
email, 0
Schmidt 0
had 0
sent 0
another 0
email 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
expressed 0
his 0
eagerness 0
to 0
“fund” 0
the 0
campaign 0
efforts 0
and 0
wants 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
“head 0
outside 0
advisor.” 0
In 0
the 0
email 0
from 0
John 0
Podesta 0
to 0
Robby 0
Mook 0
we 0
learned 0
that: 0

I 0
met 0
with 0
Eric 0
Schmidt 0
tonight. 0

As 0
David 0
reported, 0
he’s 0
ready 0
to 0
fund, 0
advise 0
recruit 0
talent, 0
etc. 0

He 0
was 0
more 0
deferential 0
on 0
structure 0
than 0
I 0
expected. 0

Wasn’t 0
pushing 0
to 0
run 0
through 0
one 0
of 0
his 0
existing 0
firms. 0

Clearly 0
wants 0
to 0
be 0
head 0
outside 0
advisor, 0
but 0
didn’t 0
seem 0
like 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
push 0
others 0
out. 0

Clearly 0
wants 0
to 0
get 0
going. 0

He’s 0
still 0
in 0
DC 0
tomorrow 0
and 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
you 0
if 0
you 0
are 0
in 0
DC 0
in 0
the 0
afternoon. 0

I 0
think 0
it’s 0
worth 0
doing. 0

You 0
around? 0

If 0
you 0
are, 0
and 0
want 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
him, 0
maybe 0
the 0
four 0
of 0

can 0

Another 0
email 0
from 0
February 0
2015 0
suggested 0
that 0
the 0
Google 0
Chairman 0
remained 0
active 0
in 0
its 0
collaboration 0
with 0
the 0

campaign: 0
John 0

that 0
Eric 0

Thursday, 0

that 0
has 0
cost 0
the 0

its 0

Francis 0
said 0
that 0
until 0
he 0
sees 0
proof 0
that 0
Bishop 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
was 0
complicit 0
in 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
sex 0
crimes 0
of 0
the 0
Rev. 0

Fernando 0
Karadima, 0
such 0
accusations 0
against 0
Barros 0
are 0
“all 1
calumny.” 1
The 0
pope’s 0
remarks 0
drew 0
shock 1
from 0
Chileans 0
and 0
immediate 0
rebuke 0
from 0
victims 0
and 0
their 0
advocates. 0

They 0
noted 0
the 0
accusers 0
were 0
deemed 0
credible 0
enough 0
by 0
the 0
Vatican 0
that 0
it 0
sentenced 0
Karadima 0
to 0
a 0
lifetime 0
of 0
“penance 0
and 0
prayer” 0
for 0
his 0
crimes 0
in 0
2011. 0

A 0
Chilean 0
judge 0
also 0
found 0
the 0
victims 0
to 0
be 0
credible, 0
saying 0
that 0
while 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
drop 0
criminal 0
charges 0
against 0
Karadima 0
because 0
too 0
much 0
time 0
had 0
passed, 0
proof 0
of 0
his 0
crimes 0
wasn’t 0
lacking. 0

[…] 0
The 0
Karadima 0
scandal 0
dominated 0
Francis’ 0
visit 0
to 0
Chile 0
and 0
the 0
overall 0
issue 0
of 0
sex 0
abuse 0
and 0
church 0
cover-up 0
was 0
likely 0
to 0
factor 0
into 0
his 0
three-day 0
trip 0
to 0
Peru 0
that 0
began 0
late 0
Thursday. 0

Karadima’s 0
victims 0
reported 0
to 0
church 0
authorities 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
2002 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
kiss 1
and 1
fondle 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
swank 1
Santiago 0
parish 0
he 0
ran, 0
but 0
officials 0
refused 0
to 0
believe 0
them. 0

Only 0
when 0
the 0
victims 0
went 0
public 0
with 0
their 0
accusations 0
in 0
2010 0
did 0
the 0
Vatican 0
launch 0
an 0
investigation 0
that 0
led 0
to 0
Karadima 0
being 0
removed 0
from 0
ministry. 0

The 0
emeritus 0
archbishop 0
of 0
Santiago 0
subsequently 0
apologized 0
for 0
having 0
refused 0
to 0
believe 0
the 0
victims 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
victims 0
made 0
clear 0
his 0
disgust 0
at 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
for 0
essentially 0
covering 0
up 0
for 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
watched 0
as 0
another 0
bishop 0
sexually 0
abused 0
him. 0

“As 0
if 0
I 0
could 0
have 0
taken 0
a 0
selfie 0
or 0
a 0
photo 0
while 0
Karadima 0
abused 0
me 0
and 0
others 0
and 0
Juan 0
Barros 0
stood 0
by 0
watching 0
it 0
all,” 0
tweeted 0
Juan 0
Carlos 0
Cruz. 0

“These 1
people 1
are 1
truly 1
crazy, 1
and 0
the 0
pontiff 0
talks 0
about 0
atonement 0
to 0
the 0
victims. 0

Nothing 0
has 0
changed, 0
and 0
his 0
plea 0
for 0
forgiveness 0
is 0
empty.” 0

This 0
obviously 0
does 0
not 0
look 0
good 0
for 0
the 0
Pope 0
or 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
as 0
they 0
are 0
now 0
apparently 0
engaging 0
in 0
attacking 0
the 0

instead 0
of 0
actually 0

nearly 0
a 0

later. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
evidence 0
appears 0
to 0
have 0
been 0
compromised: 0
In 0
December 0
2016, 0
the 0
CAO 0
notified 0
congressmen 0
that 0
the 0
caucus 0
server 0
had 0
physically 0
disappeared. 0

Though 0
Abid 0
played 0
a 0
prominent 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
late-2016 0
IG 0
report, 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
arrested, 0
with 0
congressmen 0
saying 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
is 0
ongoing. 0

In 0
January 0
2017, 0
in 0
the 0
days 0
around 0
his 0
father’s 0
death, 0
Abid 0
removed 0
Gilani 0
as 0
the 0
beneficiary 0
of 0
his 0
father’s 0
life 0
insurance 0
and 0
replaced 0
her 0
with 0
himself, 0
which 0
led 0
to 0
a 0
lawsuit, 0
TheDCNF 0
previously 0
reported. 0

Abid’s 0
attorney, 0
Jim 0
Bacon, 0
used 0
the 0
life 0
insurance 0
lawsuit 0
to 0
force 0
Gilani 0
to 0
sit 0
for 0
a 0
sworn 0
deposition 0
Oct. 0
4, 0
2017 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
told 0
her 0
to 0
reveal 0
what 0
she 0
told 0
the 0
FBI 0
about 0
the 0
congressional 0
criminal 0
probe 0
and 0
tried 0
to 0
get 0
her 0
to 0
find 0
out 0
details 0
from 0
investigators. 0

In 0
one 0
exchange, 0
Bacon 0
knew 0
that 0
she 0
had 0
emailed 0
with 0
the 0
FBI. 0

BACON 0
Q: 0
[redacted] 0
is 0
your 0
email 0
address, 0
isn’t 0
it? 0

And 0
you 0
send 0
emails 0
from 0
that 0
address 0
including 0
two 0
emails 0
to 0
the 0
FBI, 0
didn’t 0
you? 0

GILANI 0
A: 0
Yes, 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago. 0

Q: 0
No, 0
not 0
a 0

Ma’am, 1
you 1
lied 1

me, 1
didn’t 1
you? 1

You 1
lied 1
to 1
me, 1
didn’t 1
you? 1

You’re 1
a 1
liar, 1
aren’t 1
you? 1

A: 0
I 0
forgot 0
about 0
that. 0

It 1
was 1
not 1
in 1
my 1
mind. 1

BACON: 0
Ah. 0

I 0
think 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
take 0
a 0
break 0
before 1
I 1
explode. 1

"There 1
is 1
no 1
Republican 1
Party. 1

There's 1
a 1
Trump 1
party," 1
John 0
Boehner 0
told 0
a 0
Mackinac, 0
Michigan, 0
gathering 0
of 0
the 0
GOP 0
faithful 0
last 0
week. 0

"The 0
Republican 0
Party 0
is 0
kind 0
of 0
taking 0
a 0
nap 0
somewhere." 0

Ex-Speaker 0
Boehner 0
should 0
probably 0
re-check 0
the 0
old 0
party's 0
pulse, 0
for 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
GOP 0
may 0
not 0
just 0
be 0
napping. 0

It 0
could 0
be 0
comatose. 1

Consider. 0

That 0
GOP 0
was 0
dedicated 0
to 0
free 0
trade, 0
open 0
borders, 0
amnesty 0
and 0
using 0
U.S. 0
power 0
to 0
punish 1
aggressors 1
and 0
"end 1
tyranny 1
in 1
our 1
world." 1

That 0
GOP 0
set 0
out 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
new 0
world 0
order 0
where 0
dictatorships 0
were 0
threatened 0
with 0
"regime 0
change," 0
and 0
democratic 0
capitalism 0
was 0
the 0
new 0
order 0
of 0
the 0
ages. 0

Yet, 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
captured 0
the 0
Republican 0
nomination 0
and 0
won 0
the 0
presidency—by 0
saying 0
goodbye 0
to 0
all 0
that. 0

How 0
probable 0
is 0
it 0
that 0
a 0
future 0
GOP 0
presidential 0
candidate 0
will 0
revive 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
agenda 0
the 0
party 0
rejected 0
in 0
2016, 0
run 0
on 0
it, 0
win, 0
and 0
impose 0
it 0
on 0
the 0
party 0
and 0
nation? 0

Bush-Boehner 0
Republicanism 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
as 0
dead 1
today 0
as 0
was 0
Harding-Coolidge 0
Republicanism 0
after 0
1933. 0

And 0
if 1
Trumpism 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
future 1
of 1
the 1
GOP, 1
it 1
is 1
hard 1
to 1
see 1
what 1
a 1
promising 1
GOP 1
agenda 1
might 1
look 1
like. 1

A 0
brief 0
history: 0
In 0
seven 0
elections 0
starting 0
in 0
1992, 0
Republicans 0
won 0
the 0
presidency 0
three 0
times, 0
but 0
the 0
popular 0
vote 0
only 0
once, 0
in 0
2004, 0
when 0
George 0
W. 0
was 0
still 0
basking 0
in 0
his 0
"Mission 0
Accomplished" 0
in 0
Iraq. 0

What 0
fractured 0
and 0
overwhelmed 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
Republican 0
Party? 0

First, 0
demography. 0

The 0
mass 0
immigration 0
of 0
Third 0
World 0
peoples 0
that 0
began 0
with 0
the 0
1965 0
immigration 0
act, 0
and 0
the 0
decline 0
in 0
the 0
birth 0
rate 0
of 0
native-born 0
Americans, 0
began 0
to 0
swamp 0
the 0
Nixon-Reagan 0
New 0
Majority. 0

Second, 0
the 0
collapse 0
of 0
the 0
Soviet 1
Empire 1
and 0
USSR 0
removed 0
the 0
party's 0
great 1
unifying 0
cause 0
from 0
Eisenhower 0
to 0
Bush 0
I—the 0
Cold 0
War. 0

After 0
the 0
Red 0
Army 0
went 0
home, 0
"America 1
First" 1
had 0
a 0
new 0
appeal! 0

Third, 0
faithful 0
to 0
the 0
free 0
trade 0
cult 1
in 0
which 0
they 0
were 0
raised, 0
Republicans 0
championed 0
NAFTA, 0
the 0
WTO, 0
and 0
MFN 0
for 0
China. 0

Historians 0
will 0
look 0
back 0
in 0
amazement 0
at 0
how 0
America's 0
free 0
trade 0
zealots 1
gave 0
away 0
the 0
greatest 0
manufacturing 0
base 0
the 0
world 0
had 0
ever 0
seen, 0
as 0
they 0
quoted 0
approvingly 0
18th- 0
and 0
19th-century 0
scribblers 0
whose 0
ideas 0
had 0
done 0
so 0
much 0
to 0
bring 0
down 0
their 1
own 1
country, 1
Great 1
Britain. 1

Between 0
1997 0
and 0
2017, 0
the 0
EU 0
ran 0
up, 0
at 0
America's 0
expense, 0
trade 0
surpluses 0
in 0
goods 0
in 0
excess 0
of 0
$2 0
trillion, 0
while 0
we 0
also 0
picked 0
up 0
the 0
bill 0
for 0
Europe's 0
defense. 0

Between 0
1992 0
and 0
2016, 0
China 1
was 1
allowed 1
to 1
run 1
$4 1
trillion 1
in 1
trade 1
surpluses 1
at 1
our 1
expense, 1
converting 1
herself 1
into 1
the 1
world's 1
first 1
manufacturing 1
power 1
and 1
denuding 1
America 1
of 1
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
factories 1
and 1
millions 1
of 1
manufacturing 1
jobs. 1

In 0
Trump's 0
first 0
year, 0
China's 0
trade 0
surplus 0
with 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
hit 0
$375 0
billion. 0

From 0
January 0
to 0
March 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
our 0
trade 0
deficit 0
with 0
China 0
was 0
running 0
at 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
same 0
astronomical 0
rate. 0

"Trade 0
deficits 0
do 0
not 0
matter," 0
we 0
hear 0
from 0
the 0
economists. 0

They 0
might 0
explain 0
that 0
to 0
Ohio, 0
Michigan 0
and 0
Pennsylvania. 0

And 0
perhaps 0
someone 0
can 0
explain 0
the 0
wisdom 0
of 0
handing 0
4 0
percent 0
of 0
our 0
GDP 0
each 0
year 0
to 0
an 0
adversary 0
nation, 0
as 0
U.S. 0
admirals 0
talk 0
tough 0
about 0
confronting 0
that 0
adversary 0
nation 0
over 0
islets 0
and 0
reefs 0
in 0
the 0
South 0
China 0
Sea. 0

Why 0
are 0
we 0
enriching 0
and 0
empowering 0
so 0
exorbitantly 0
those 0
whom 0
we 0
are 0
told 0
we 0
may 0
have 0
to 0
fight? 0

Fourth, 0
under 0
Bush 0
II 0
and 0
Obama, 0
the 0
U.S. 0
intervened 0
massively 0
in 0
the 0
Near 0
and 0
Middle 0
East—in 0
Afghanistan, 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
Syria, 0
Yemen. 0

And 0
the 0
forces 0
that 0
pushed 0
up 0
into 0
those 0
conflicts, 0
and 0
so 1
disillusioned 1
the 1
nation 1
that 1
it 1
elected 1
Barack 1
Obama, 1
are 0
back, 0
pushing 0
for 0
a 0
new 0
war, 0
on 0
Iran. 0

They 0
may 0
get 0
this 0
war, 0
too. 0

Yet, 0
given 0
the 0
anti-interventionist 0
and 0
anti-war 0
stance 0
of 0
Trump's 0
winning 0
campaign, 0
and 0
of 0
the 0
Bernie 0
Sanders 0
campaign, 0
U.S. 0
involvement 0
in 0
Middle 0
East 0
wars 0
seems 0
less 0
America's 0
future 0
than 0
it 0
does 0
her 0
past. 0

After 0
his 0
16 0
months 0
in 0
office, 0
it 0
appears 0
as 0
though 0
the 0
Trump 0
presidency, 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
brief, 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
watershed 1
moment 1
in 1
U.S. 1
and 1
world 1
history, 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
future 1
of 1
the 1
GOP. 1

The 0
world 0
is 0
changing. 0

NATO 0
and 0
the 0
EU 0
are 0
showing 0
their 0
age. 0

Nationalism, 0
populism 0
and 0
tribalism 0
are 0
pervasive 0
on 0
the 0
Old 0
Continent. 0

And 0
America's 0
willingness 0
to 0
bear 0
the 0
burden 0
of 0
Europe's 0
defense, 0
as 0
they 0
ride 0
virtually 0
free, 0
is 0
visibly 0
waning. 0

It 0
is 0
hard 0
to 0
see 0
why 0
or 0
how 0
Republicans 0
are 0
ever 0
again 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
party 0
that 0
preceded 0
the 0
rise 0
of 0
Trump. 0

What 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
argument 0
for 0
returning 0
to 0
a 0
repudiated 1
platform? 0

Trump 0
not 0
only 0
defeated 0
16 0
Bush 0
Republicans, 0
he 0
presented 0
an 0
agenda 0
on 0
immigration, 0
border 0
security, 0
amnesty, 0
intervention 0
abroad, 0
the 0
Middle 0
East, 0
NAFTA, 0
free 0
trade, 0
Putin 0
and 0
Russia 0
that 0
was 0
a 0
rejection 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
Bush-Boehner 0
Party 0
had 0
stood 0
for 0
and 0
what 0
its 0
presidential 0
candidates 0
in 0
2008 0
and 0
2012, 0
John 0
McCain 0
and 0
Mitt 0
Romney, 0
had 0
run 0
on. 0

If 0
the 0
Republican 0
Party 0
is 0
"napping," 0
let 0
it 0
slumber 0
on, 0
undisturbed, 0
for 0
its 1
time 1
has 1
come 1
and 1
gone. 1

are 0

A 0
colossal 0
Neptunian 0
storm 0
just 0
vanished 0
before 0
our 0
eyes 0

You 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
look 0
far 0
for 0
fresh 0
news 0
about 0
Mars, 0
Saturn, 0
or 0
Jupiter 0
these 0
days, 0
but 0
Neptune 0
doesn’t 0
always 0
get 0
the 0
same 0
kind 0
of 0
attention. 0

The 0
big 0
frigid 0
blue 0
ball 0
is 0
the 0
farthest 0
planet 0
from 0
the 0
Sun 0
— 0
since 0
we 0
don’t 0
count 0
Pluto 0
as 0
a 0
planet 0
anymore 0
— 0
and 0
it 0
hasn’t 0
been 0
studied 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
intensity 0
of 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
others. 0

Thankfully 0
the 0
Hubble 0
Space 0
Telescope 0
hasn’t 0
lost 0
interest 0
in 0
the 0
distant 0
planet, 0
because 0
it 0
just 0
captured 0
one 0
of 0
Neptunes 0
massive 0
storms 0
losing 0
steam 0
as 0
it 0
roars 0
across 0
the 0
planet. 0

Storms 0
on 0
Neptune 0
appear 0
as 0
giant 0
dark 0
ovals, 0
a 0
bit 0
like 0
Jupiter’s 0
Great 0
Red 0
Spot. 0

However, 0
unlike 0
Jupiter’s 0
centuries-old 0
storm, 0
Neptune’s 0
hurricane-like 0
weather 0
events 0
only 0
last 0
a 0
few 0
years 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
before 0
eventually 0
dissipating. 0

Of 0
course, 0
that’s 0
not 0
to 0
say 0
the 0
storms 0
are 0
insignificant 0
— 0
many 0
are 0
large 0
enough 0
to 0
swallow 0
and 0
entire 0
continent 0
here 0
on 0
Earth 0
— 0
so 0
watching 0
one 0
breathe 1
its 1
dying 1
gasps 1
is 0
still 0
a 0
special 0
sight. 0

The 0
planet, 0
which 0
NASA 0
says 0
is 0
the 0
windiest 0
in 0
our 0
Solar 0
System, 0
hosts 0
regular 0
storms 0
which 0
appear 0
as 0
large 0
spots 0
on 0
its 0
surface, 0
but 0
scientists 0
are 0
still 0
at 0
a 0
loss 0
as 0
to 0
how 0
they 0
actually 0
occur. 0

“We 0
have 0
no 0
evidence 0
of 0
how 0
these 0
vortices 0
are 0
formed 0
or 0
how 0
fast 0
they 0
rotate,” 0
Agustín 0
Sánchez-Lavega 0
of 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
the 0
Basque 0
Country 0
in 0
Spain 0
explains. 0

“It 0
is 0
most 0
likely 0
that 0
they 0
arise 0
from 0
an 0
instability 0
in 0
the 0
sheared 0
eastward 0
and 0
westward 0
winds.” 0

The 0
observation 0
of 0
this 0
particular 0
storm 0
dying 0
out 0
is 0
significant 0
because 0
it’s 0
the 0
very 0
first 0
time 0
one 0
of 0
Neptune’s 0
storms 0
has 0
been 0
observed 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way. 0

It 0
also 0
goes 0
against 0
everything 0
that 0
scientists 0
thought 0
they 0
knew 0
about 0
how 0
forms 0
on 0

On 0

the 0

spit 0
out 0
a 0

As 0

this 0

cause 0

may 0
even 0
have 0
a 0

almost 1
immediately 1

Once 0

this 0

we 0
see 0
that 0
Ramadan 1
is 1
quintessentially 1
the 1
month 1
of 1

A 0
jihad 0
group 0
explained 0

back 0
in 0

“The 0

Does 0
Ramadan 0
remind 0
us 0
of 0
“the 0
richness 0
Muslims 0
add 0
to 0
the 1
religious 1
tapestry 1
of 1
American 1
life,” 1
or 0
is 0
Ramadan 0
“a 0
month 0
of 0
calamity 0
everywhere 0
for 0
nonbelievers”? 0

Islam’s 1
core 1
beliefs 1
make 1
it 1
clear 1
that 1
the 1
latter 1
statement 1
is 1
closer 1
to 1
the 1
truth. 1

During 0
Ramadan, 0
Muslims 0
are 0
exhorted 0
to 0
renew 0
and 0
deepen 0
their 0
devotion 0
to 0
Allah. 0

Hence 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
time 0
when 0
they’re 0
supposed 0
to 0
grow 0
more 0
generous 0
and 0
kind 0
toward 0
their 0
fellow 0
Muslims. 0

However, 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
says: 0
“Muhammad 0
is 0
the 0
Messenger 0
of 0
Allah, 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
with 0
him 0
are 0
severe 1
against 1
disbelievers, 0
and 0
merciful 0
among 0
themselves” 0
(48:29). 0

If 0
the 0
Ramadan 0
imperative 0
is 0
to 0
become 0
more 0
devout, 0
the 0
Muslim 0
who 0
applies 0
himself 0
diligently 0
to 0
the 0
Ramadan 0
observance 0
will 0
simultaneously 0
become 0
more 0
both 0
merciful 0
to 0
his 0
fellow 0
Muslims 0
and 0
more 1
severe 1
against 1
the 0
unbelievers. 0

Murdering 1
infidels 1
thus 1
doesn’t 1
contradict 1
the 1
spirit 1
of 1
Ramadan; 1
it 1
embodies 1
it. 1

The 0
Kavkaz 0
Center, 0
a 0
website 0
operated 0
by 0
Chechen 1
jihadists, 1
explained 0
in 0
a 0
2010 0
article 0
that 0
the 0
idea 0
of 0
Ramadan 0
as 0
a 0
time 0
for 0
warfare 0
against 0
infidels 1
went 0
back 0
to 0
Muhammad’s 0
time: 0
“The 0
month 0
of 0
Ramadan 0
in 0
the 0
life 0
of 0
the 0
Prophet 0
(pbuh) 0
and 0
the 0
righteous 0
ancestors 0
was 0
a 0
month 0
of 0
forthcoming. 0

The 0
greatest 0
battles 0
during 0
the 0
lifetime 0
of 0
the 0
Prophet 0
(pbuh) 0
occurred 0
in 0
this 1
blessed 1
month, 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad, 1
zeal 0
and 0
enthusiasm.” 0

Trump 0
was, 0
unfortunately, 0
following 0
the 0
example 0
of 0
his 0
two 0
immediate 0
predecessors 0
when 0
he 0
claimed 0
that 0
“Ramadan 0
reminds 0
us 0
of 0
the 0
richness 0
Muslims 0
add 0
to 1
the 1
religious 1
tapestry 1
of 1
American 1
life,” 1
and 0
was 0
severely 1
misleading 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

Ironically, 0
even 0
in 0
doing 0
this 0
he 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
fail 0
to 0
satisfy 0
Muslims, 0
or 0
anyone. 0

After 0
all, 0
after 0
the 0
Trump 0
White 0
House 0
issued 0
a 0
similar 0
statement 0
last 0
year, 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
ran 0
a 0
lengthy 0
piece 0
in 0
which 0
several 0
Muslims 0
explained 0
why 0
the 0
statement 0
was 0
unsatisfactory 0
to 0
them. 0

Shadi 0
Hamid 0
of 0
the 0
Qatar-funded 0
Brookings 0
Institution 0
declared: 0
“Trump 1
has 1
so 1
rarely 1

but 1
this 1

proof 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
aware 1
of 1
our 1
existence. 1

Great! 1

Putting 0
all 0
that 0
context 0
aside, 0
it’s 0
offensive 0
and 0
pretty 1
much 1
terrible.” 1

Why? 0

Because 0
Trump 0
had 0
the 0
temerity 0
to 0
mention 0
jihad 0
terrorism. 0

Hamid 0
continued: 0
“We, 0
as 0
American 0
Muslims, 0
shouldn’t 0
be 0
defined 0
solely 0
in 0
our 0
relationship 0
to 0
bad 0
things 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with. 0

We’re 0
also 0
normal 0
people 0
who 0
happen 0
to 0
be 0
Muslim 0
and 0
to 0
see 0
us 0
and 0
our 0
history 0
in 0
America 0
so 0
narrowly 0
is 0
plain 1
out 1
offensive.” 1

What 1
is 1
actually 1
offensive 1
is 1
that 1
Hamid 1
would 1
try 1
in 1
this 1
way 1
to 1
absolve 1
the 1
Muslim 1
community 1
of 1
any 1
responsibility 1
to 1
root 1
out 1
jihad 1
terrorist 1
from 1
its 1
midst. 1

There 0
is 0
certain 0
to 0
be 0
more 0
jihad 0
terrorism 0
during 0
this 0
Ramadan, 0
and 0
some 0
of 0
it 0
may 0
be 0
committed 0
by 0
Muslims 0
in 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Hamid, 1
if 1
he 1
cared 1
about 1
this, 1
would 1
be 1
confronting 1
honestly 1
the 1
teachings 1
of 1
Islam 1
that 1
make 1
Ramadan 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad, 1
and 1
working 1
to 1
reform 1
them. 1

Meanwhile, 0
it 1
would 1
be 1
dangerous, 1
suicidal 1
folly 1
for 1
Infidels 1
to 1
pretend 1
that 1
Ramadan 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
month 1
of 1
jihad. 1

And 1
as 1
our 1
Ramadan 1
willful 1
blindness 1
continues, 1
more 1
Infidels 1
will 1
die. 1

which 1
mentioned 1

are 1
apparently 1
at 1
odds 1
with 1
the 1

McLetchie 0
has 0

“The 0

fought 0
to 0

Black 1
Death 1
Epidemic 1
Could 1
‘Explode’ 1

The 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
outbreak 0
that 0
is 0
taking 0
Madagascar 0
to 0
its 0
knees 0
will 0
more 0
than 0
likely 0
last 0
another 0
six 0
months. 0

But 0
the 0
worst 0
news 0
is 0
that 0
the 1
epidemic 1
could 1
explode 1
anytime 1
unleashing 1
the 1
sickness 1
on 1
the 1
globe. 1

At 0
least 0
128 0
people 0
have 0
been 0
killed 0
and 0
more 0
than 0
1,300 0
infected 0
by 0
the 0
deadlier 0
pneumonic 0
strain 0
of 0
the 0
medieval 0
disease. 0

But 0
the 0
oncoming 0
rainy 0
season 0
could 0
see 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
those 0
infected 0
explode 1
exponentially. 0

The 0
rainy 0
season 0
poses 0
a 0
threat 0
to 0
the 0
containment 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
because 0
outbreaks 0
of 0
this 0
magnitude 0
often 0
seem 0
to 0
be 0
seasonal. 0

The 0
Foreign 0
Office 0
recently 0
warned 0
that 0
the 1
deadly 1
outbreak 1
is 1
entering 1
its 1
most 1
dangerous 1
phase. 1

Its 0
website 0
said 0
that 0
“outbreaks 0
of 0
plague 0
tend 0
to 0
be 0
seasonal 0
and 0
occur 0
mainly 0
during 0
the 0
rainy 0
season.” 0
The 0
African 0
island’s 0
wet 0
season 0
officially 0
began 0
today 0
and 0
will 0
last 0
until 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
April, 0
meaning 0
the 1
downward 1
trend 1
the 1
plague 1
had 1
seen 1
over 1
the 1
past 1
few 1
days, 1
will 1
likely 1
turn 1
upward 1
again. 1

Because 0
the 0
disease 0
can 0
be 0
spread 0
easily 0
through 0
a 0
cough 0
or 0
sneeze, 0
experts 0
are 0
fearful. 0

It 1
would 1
take 1
just 1
one 1
infected 1
traveler 0
who 0
made 0
it 0
to 0
Africa’s 0
mainland 0
or 0
even 0
nearby 0
British 0
honeymoon 0
paradises 0
like 0
Mauritius, 0
the 0
Maldives 0
or 0
the 0
Seychelles 0
to 0
spread 0
the 0
disease 0
globally. 0

The 0
Seychelles 0
is 0
currently 0
putting 0
anyone 0
traveling 0
from 0
Madagascar 0
into 0
quarantine 0
on 0
arrival 0
as 0
a 0
precaution. 0

The 1
outbreak 1
has 1
been 1
fueled 1
by 1
performing 1
the 1
ancient 1
practice 1
of 1
Famadihana. 1

Famadihana 0
is 0
the 0
“dancing 0
with 0
the 0
dead” 0
ritual 0
which 0
sees 0
locals 0
dig 0
up 0
deceased 0
relatives 0
and 0
dance 0
with 0
them 0
before 0
they 0
are 0
reburied. 0

Just 0
contact 0
with 0
a 0
corpse 0
who’s 0
death 0
was 0
because 0
they 0
contracted 0
the 0
plague 0
could 0
sicken 0
a 0
person. 0

The 0
country’s 0
health 0
chief 0
Willy 0
Randriamarotia 0
said: 0
“If 0
a 0
person 0
dies 0
of 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
and 0
is 0
then 0
interred 0
in 0
a 0
tomb 0
that 0
is 0
subsequently 0
opened 0
for 0
a 0
Famadihana, 0
the 0
bacteria 0
can 1
still 1
be 1
transmitted 1
and 1
contaminate 1
whoever 1
handles 1
the 1
body.” 1
The 1
tradition 1
has 1
been 1
banned 1
since 1
the 1
outbreak 1
began, 1
but 0
it 0
is 0

as 0
local 1
continue 1
to 1
balk 1
that 1
their 1
rituals 1
have 1
contributed 1
to 1
the 1
outbreak. 1

This 0
latest 0
warning 0
that 0
the 0
rainy 0
season 0
could 0
worsen 0
the 0
outbreak 0
comes 0
on 0
the 0
heels 0
of 0

Julian 0
Assange 0

During 0
World 0
War 0
II 0
Cardinal 0
Jozsef 0
Mindszenty 0
was 0
a 0
huge 0
critic 0
of 0
fascism 0
and 0
wound 0
up 0
in 0
prison. 0

In 0
Oct. 0
1945 0
he 0
became 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
Hungary 0
and 0
spoke 0
out 0
just 0
as 0
strongly 0
against 0
Communist 0
oppression. 0

He 0
wound 0
up 0
back 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
eight 0
more 0
years, 0
including 0
long 0
periods 0
of 0
solitary 0
confinement 0
and 0
endured 0
other 0
forms 0
of 0
torture. 0

In 0
1949 0
he 0
was 0
sentenced 0
to 0
life 0
in 0
a 1
show 1
trial 1
that 0
generated 1
worldwide 1
condemnation. 1

Two 0
weeks 0
after 0
the 0
trial 0
began 0
in 0
early 0
1949, 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
(having 0
failed 0
to 0
speak 0
out 0
forcefully 0
against 0
the 0
Third 0
Reich) 0
did 0
summon 0
the 0
courage 0
to 0
condemn 0
what 0
was 0
happening 0
to 0
Mindszenty. 0

Pius 0
excommunicated 0
everyone 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
Mindszenty 0
trial. 0

Then, 0
addressing 0
a 0
huge 0
crowd 0
on 0
St. 0
Peter’s 0
Square, 0
he 0
asked, 0
“Do 1
you 1
want 1
a 1
Church 1
that 1
remains 1
silent 1
when 1
she 1
should 1
speak 1
… 1
a 1
Church 1
that 1
does 1
not 1
condemn 1
the 1
suppression 1
of 1
conscience 1
and 1
does 1
not 1
stand 1
up 1
for 1
the 1
just 1
liberty 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
… 1
a 1
Church 1
that 1
locks 1
herself 1
up 1
within 1
the 1
four 1
walls 1
of 1
her 1
temple 1
in 1
unseemly 1

…?” 0

When 0
the 0
Hungarian 0
revolution 0
broke 0
out 0
in 0
1956, 0
Mindszenty 0
was 0
freed, 0
but 0
only 0
for 0
four 0
days. 0

When 0
Soviet 0
tanks 0
rolled 0
back 0
into 0

he 0
fled 0
to 0

Fourth 1

on 1
Life 1
Support 1

In 0
2010, 0
while 0
he 0
was 0
still 0
a 0
free 0
man, 0
the 0
Sam 0
Adams 0
Associates 0
for 0
Integrity 0
gave 0
its 0
annual 0
award 0
to 0
Assange. 0

The 0
citation 0
read: 0

“It 0
seems 0
altogether 0
fitting 0
and 0
proper 0
that 0
this 0
year’s 0
award 0
be 0
presented 0
in 0
London, 0
where 0
Edmund 0
Burke 0
coined 0
the 0
expression 0
“Fourth 0
Estate.” 0
Comparing 0
the 0
function 0
of 0
the 0
press 0
to 0
that 0
of 0
the 0
three 0
Houses 0
then 0
in 0
Parliament, 0
Burke 0
said: 0
“…but 0
in 0
the 0
Reporters 0
Gallery 0
yonder, 0
there 0
sits 0
a 1
Fourth 1
Estate 1
more 1
important 1
far 1
then 1
they 1
all.” 1
The 0
year 0
was 0
1787—the 0
year 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Constitution 0
was 0
adopted. 0

The 0
First 0
Amendment, 0
approved 0
four 0
years 0
later, 0
aimed 0
at 0
ensuring 0
that 0
the 0
press 0
would 0
be 0
free 0
of 0
government 0
interference. 0

That 0
was 0
then. 0

With 0
the 0
Fourth 1
Estate 1
now 1
on 1
life 1
support, 1
there 0
is 0
a 0
high 0
premium 0
on 0
the 0
fledgling 0
Fifth 0
Estate, 0
which 0
uses 0
the 0
ether 0
and 0
is 0
not 0
susceptible 0
of 0
government 0
or 0
corporation 0
control. 0

Small 1
wonder 1
that 0
governments 0
with 0
lots 0
to 0
hide 0
feel 0
very 0
threatened. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
said: 0
“You 0
shall 0
know 0
the 0
truth, 0
and 0
the 0
truth 0
shall 0
set 0
you 0
free.” 0
WikiLeaks 0
is 0
helping 0
make 0
that 0
possible 0
by 0
publishing 0
documents 0
that 0
do 0
not 0
lie. 0

Last 0
spring, 0
when 0
we 0
chose 0
WikiLeaks 0
and 0
Julian 0
Assange 0
for 0
this 0
award, 0
Julian 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
accept 0
only 0
“on 0
behalf 0
or 0
our 0
sources, 0
without 0
which 0
WikiLeaks’ 0
contributions 0
are 0
of 0
no 0
significance.” 0
We 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
if 0
Pvt. 0

Bradley 0
Manning 0
gave 0
WikiLeaks 0
the 0
gun-barrel 0
video 0
of 0
July 0
12, 0
2007 0
called 0
“Collateral 0
Murder.” 0
Whoever 0
did 0
provide 0
that 0
graphic 0
footage, 0
showing 0
the 1
brutality 1
of 1
the 1
celebrated 1
“surge” 1
in 1
Iraq, 1
was 0
certainly 0
far 1
more 1
a 1
patriot 1
than 0
the 1
“mainstream” 1
journalist 1
embedded 0
in 0
that 0
same 0
Army 0
unit. 0

He 0
suppressed 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
Baghdad 0
that 0
day, 0
dismissed 0
it 0
as 0
simply 0
“one 1
bad 1
day 1
in 1
a 1
surge 1
that 1
was 1
filled 1
with 1
such 1
days,” 1
and 0
then 0
had 1
the 1
temerity 1
to 1
lavish 1
praise 1
on 0
the 0
unit 0
in 0
a 0
book 0
he 0
called 0
“The 0
Good 0
Soldiers.” 0
Julian 0
is 0
right 0
to 0
emphasize 0
that 0
the 0
world 0
is 0
deeply 0
indebted 0
to 0
patriotic 1
truth-tellers 1
like 0
the 0
sources 0
who 0
provided 0
the 0
gun-barrel 0
footage 0
and 0
the 0
many 0
documents 0
on 0
Afghanistan 0
and 0
Iraq 0
to 0
WikiLeaks. 0

We 0
hope 0
to 0
have 0
a 0
chance 0
to 0
honor 0
them 0
in 0
person 0
in 0
the 0
future. 0

Today 0
we 0
honor 0
WikiLeaks, 0
and 0
one 0
of 0
its 0
leaders, 0
Julian 0
Assange, 0
for 0
their 0
ingenuity 0
in 0
creating 0
a 0
new 0
highway 0
by 0
which 0
important 0
documentary 0
evidence 0
can 0
make 0
its 0
way, 0
quickly 0
and 0
confidentially, 0
through 0
the 0
ether 0
and 0
into 0
our 0
in-boxes. 0

Long 1
live 1
the 1
Fifth 1
Estate!” 1

Eventually 0
a 0
compromise 0
was 0
found 0
in 0
1971 0
when 0
Pope 0
Paul 0
VI 0
lifted 0
the 0
excommunications 0
and 0
Mindszenty 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
leave 0
the 0
U.S. 0
embassy. 0

Can 0
such 0
a 0
diplomatic 0
solution 0
be 0
found 0
to 0
free 0
Assange? 0

It 0
is 0
looking 0
more 0
and 0
more 0
unlikely 0
with 0
each 0
passing 0
year. 0

Iranian 0
Aggression 0
Intensifies 0

Last 0
July, 0
Major 0
General 0
Mohammad 0
Bagheri, 0
the 0
Iranian 0
Revolutionary 0
Guards 0
(IRGC) 0
military 0
commander 0
and 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
armed 0
forces, 0
warned 0
that 0
“putting 1
the 1
Revolutionary 1
Guard 1
in 1
the 1
terrorist 1
lists 1
with 1
terrorist 1
groups 1
can 1
be 1
very 1
costly 1
to 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
and 1
its 1
military 1
bases 1
and 1
forces 1
in 1
the 1
region.” 1
IRGC 0
commander 0
Mohammad 0
Ali 0
Jafari 0
said 0
on 0
October 0
8th 0
that 0
"if 0
the 0
news 0
is 0
correct 0
about 0
the 1
stupidity 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
government 1
in 0
considering 0
the 0
Revolutionary 0
Guards 0
a 0
terrorist 0
group, 0
then 0
the 0
Revolutionary 0
Guards 0
will 0
consider 0
the 0
American 0
army 0
to 0
be 0
like 0
Islamic 0
State 0
all 0
around 0
the 0
world." 0

The 0
next 0
day 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
warned 0
of 0
a 0
"crushing" 0
response 0
if 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
were 0
to 0
designate 0
the 0
IRGC 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization. 0

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
called 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
bluff 0
with 0
his 0
announcement 0
last 0
week 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
do 0
just 0
that. 0

Designating 0
the 0
IRGC 0
as 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
and 0
imposing 0
new 0
sanctions 0
for 0
its 0
aggressive 0
actions 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
restoration 0
of 0
the 0
sanctions 0
lifted 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
its 0
disastrous 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
with 0
Iran. 0

If 0
Iran 0
insists 0
it 0
can 0
do 0
what 0
it 0
wants 0
militarily 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
missile 0
launches, 0
support 0
of 0
terrorist 0
groups 0
such 0
as 0
Hezbollah 0
and 0
Hamas, 0
and 0
arms 0
transfers 0
without 0
violating 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
then 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
can 0
certainly 0
act 0
to 0
curb 0
such 0
activities 0
through 0
financial 0
pressure. 0

The 0
U.S. 0
can 0
impose 0
sanctions 0
against 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime’s 0
principal 0
instrument 0
for 0
projecting 0
aggressive, 0
destabilizing 0
force 0
outside 0
of 0
its 0
borders 0
without 0
violating 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

The 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
does 0
not 0
see 0
it 0
that 0
way, 0
however. 0

With 0
the 0
lifting 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear-related 0
sanctions 0
making 0
available 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
leaders 0
to 0
further 0
finance 0
the 0
IRGC’s 0
exploits 0
in 0
Iraq, 0
Syria, 0
Lebanon, 0
Yemen 0
and 0
elsewhere, 0
the 0
regime 0
is 0
furious 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
is 0
tightening 0
the 0
financial 0
screws 0
again, 0
even 0
if 0
for 0
reasons 0
not 0
directly 0
related 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal. 0

Thus, 1
it 1
is 1
threatening 1
U.S. 1
forces 1
and 1
bases 1
in 1
the 1
region. 1

A 0
couple 0
of 0
seemingly 0
unrelated 0
events 0
this 0
past 0
week 0
point 1
to 1
Iran’s 1
positioning 1
itself 1
for 1
more 1
aggressive 1
military 1
actions 1
that 1
could 1
place 1
U.S. 1
forces 1
in 1
harm’s 1
way. 1

On 0
Tuesday, 0
Major 0
General 0
Bagheri 0
landed 0
in 0
Damascus 0
for 0
talks 0
with 0
Syrian 0
President 0
Bashar 0
Assad 0
and 0
senior 0
Syrian 0
officials, 0
including 0
the 0
defense 0
minister 0
and 0
the 0
chief 0
of 0
staff 0
of 0
the 0
Syrian 0
armed 0
forces. 0

Bagheri 0
is 0
quoted 0
as 0
saying 0
that 0
his 0
visit’s 0
purpose 0
was 0
to 0
“put 0
a 0
joint 0
strategy 0
on 0
continuing 0
co-ordination 0
and 0
co-operation 0
at 0
the 0
military 0
level.” 0
Some 0
experts 0
on 0
Iran 0
believe 0
that 0
Bagheri’s 0
visit 0
to 0
Damascus 0
at 0
this 0
time 0
is 0
intended 0
to 0
reinforce 0
a 0
message 0
that 0
Iran 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
supply 0
weaponry 0
to 0
Syria 0
and 0
to 0
reinforce 0
the 0
presence 0
of 0
its 0
terrorist 0
proxy 0
Hezbollah 0
in 0
Syria. 0

This 1
will 1
not 1
only 1
serve 1
to 1
bolster 1
the 1
Assad 1
regime, 1
but 1
it 1
also 1
will 1
strengthen 1
Iran's 1
ability 1
to 1
follow 1
through 1
on 1
its 1
threats 1
to 1
the 1
U.S. 1
and 1
its 1
allies, 1
principally 1
Israel. 1

Meanwhile, 0
following 0
the 0
departure 0
of 0
the 0
Kurds 0
from 0
Kirkuk, 0
Iraq 0
earlier 0
this 0
week, 0
the 0
IRGC’s 0
operational 0
Al 0
Qods 0
arm 0
reportedly 0
established 0
a 0
command 0
center 0
and 0
five 0
bases 0
there. 0

According 0
to 0
Debkafile, 0
this 0
constitutes 0
“the 0
first 0
military 0
facility 0
Iran 0
has 0
ever 0
established 0
openly 0
in 0
Iraq.” 0
The 0
Kirkuk 0
region 0
holds 0
45 0
percent 0
of 0
Iraqi’s 0
oil. 0

The 1
Iraqi 1
branch 1
of 1
Iran’s 1
terrorist 1
proxy 1
Hezbollah 1
has 1
vowed 1
that 1
once 1
ISIS 1
is 1
defeated 1
it 1
will 1
start 1
killing 1
Americans, 1
as 1
it 1
has 1
done 1
before. 1

It 0
is 0
against 0
this 0
backdrop 0
that 0
U.S. 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
Nations 0
Nikki 0
Haley 0
used 0
her 0
entire 0
speech 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
Security 0
Council 0
on 0
Wednesday 0
to 0
denounce 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
on 0
multiple 0
grounds. 0

The 0
session 0
was 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
devoted 0
to 0
the 0
Israeli-Palestinian 0
conflict, 0
but 0
Ambassador 0
Haley 0
departed 0
from 0
the 0
monthly 0
ritual 0
during 0
which 0
Israel 0
is 0
normally 0
singled 0
out 0
for 0
criticism 0
by 0
other 0
Council 0
members. 0

She 0
went 0
after 0
Iran 0
instead. 0

She 0
explained 0
why 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
decided 0
to 0
take 0
“a 0
comprehensive 0
approach 0
to 0
confronting 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime,” 0
which 0
does 0
not 0
give 0
the 0
regime 0
a 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
jail 0
free 0
card 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
is 0
in 0
technical 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
loophole-ridden 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
agreed 0
to 0
by 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration. 0

“We 0
can’t 0
talk 0
about 0
stability 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
without 0
talking 0
about 0
Iran,” 0
Ambassador 0
Haley 0
said. 0

“That’s 0
because 0
nearly 0
every 0
threat 0
to 0
peace 0
and 0
security 0
in 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
is 0
connected 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
outlaw 1
behavior. 1

The 0
United 0
States 0
has 0
now 0
embarked 0
on 0
a 0
course 0
that 0
attempts 0
to 0
address 0
all 0
aspects 0
of 0
Iran’s 0
destructive 0
conduct, 0
not 0
just 0
one 0
aspect. 0

It’s 0
critical 0
that 0
the 0
international 0
community 0
do 0
the 0
same. 0

Judging 0
Iran 0
by 0
the 0
narrow 0
confines 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
misses 0
the 0
true 0
nature 0
of 0

Iran 0
must 0
be 0
judged 0
in 0
totality 0
of 0
its 1
aggressive, 1
destabilizing, 1
and 1
unlawful 1
behavior. 1

To 1
do 1
otherwise 1
would 1
be 1
foolish.” 1

Ambassador 0
Haley 0
accused 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
of 0
continuing 0
to 0
“play” 0
the 0
Security 0
Council. 0

“Iran 0
hides 0
behind 0
its 0
assertion 0
of 0
technical 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
while 0
it 0
brazenly 0
violates 0
the 0
other 0
limits 0
on 0
its 0
behavior. 0

And 0
we 0
have 0
allowed 0
them 0
to 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
it. 0

This 0
must 0
stop.” 0

Ambassador 0
Haley 0
proceeded 0
to 0
list 0
various 0
violations 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
of 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolutions 0
pertaining 0
to 0
the 0
transfer 0
of 0
conventional 0
weapons 0
from 0
Iran 0
and 0
the 0
arming 0
of 0
terrorist 0
groups, 0
including 0
the 0
Houthi 0
rebels 0
in 0
Yemen 0
and 0
Hezbollah. 0

She 0
also 0
pointed 0
to 0
what 0
she 0
called 0
the 1
Iranian 1
regime’s 1
“most 1
threatening 1
act” 1
– 0
its 0
launch 0
of 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
capable 0
of 0
carrying 0
nuclear 0
weapons. 0

“When 0
a 0
rogue 0
regime 0
starts 0
down 0
the 0
path 0
of 0
ballistic 0
missiles, 0
it 1
tells 1
us 1
that 1
we 1
will 1
soon 1
have 1
another 1
North 1
Korea 1
on 1
our 1
hands,” 1
Ambassador 0
Haley 0
said. 0

“If 1
it 1
is 1
wrong 1
for 1
North 1
Korea 1
to 1
do 1
this, 1
why 1
doesn’t 1
that 1
same 1
mentality 1
apply 1
to 1
Iran? 1

As 0

Atomic 0
Energy 0
Agency 0
(IAEA) 0
Director 0
General 0
Yukiya 0

admitted 0
last 0

that 0
when 0
it 0

to 0
the 0
IAEA’s 0
capacity 0
to 0
check 0
whether 0
Iran 0
was 0
conducting 0
work 0
on 0
a 0
nuclear 0
explosive 0
device, 0
his 0
agency’s 0
“tools 0
are 0
limited.” 0
The 0
Iranian 0
regime 0
has 0
also 0
attempted 0
to 0
skirt 0
the 0
restrictions 0
in 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
on 0
its 0
procurement 0
of 0
materials, 0
equipment, 0
goods 0
and 0
technology 0
related 0
to 0
Iran’s 0
nuclear 0
activities. 0

The 0
Heritage 0
Foundation 0
noted 0
in 0
its 0
recent 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
JCPOA, 0
for 0
example, 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
“caught 1
red-handed 1
trying 0
to 0
purchase 0
nuclear 0
technology 0
and 0
restricted 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
technology 0
from 0
German 0
companies.” 0

U.S. 0
intelligence 0
had 0
discovered 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
transfer 0
of 0
missile 0
parts 0
to 0
Iran 0
at 0
the 0
very 0
same 0
time 0
that 0
Iran 0
was 0
negotiating 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
in 0
clear 0
violation 0
of 0
UN 0
Security 0
Council 0
resolutions 0
then 0
in 0
effect. 0

The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
chose 0
to 0
look 0
the 0
other 0
way. 0

Does 0
anybody 0
with 0
a 1
modicum 1
of 1
sense 1
really 0
believe 0
that 0
such 0
collaboration 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
rogue 0
nations 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
on 0
today? 0

Iran 0
is 0
flush 0
with 0
cash, 0
thanks 0
to 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

It 0
wants 0
to 0
build 0
out 0
its 0
missile 0
and 0
nuclear 0
enrichment 0
capabilities. 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
covert 0
transfers 0
of 0
materials 0
and 0
technology 0
to 0
Iran 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal, 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
may 0
provide 0
a 0
loophole 0
for 0
Iran 0
to 0
exploit 0
in 0
outsourcing 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
development 0
work 0
to 0
North 0
Korea 0
for 0
hard 0
currency, 0
which 0
North 0
Korea 0
desperately 0
needs. 0

They 1
are 1
a 1
perfect 1
match 1
for 1
each 1
other. 1

Proponents 0
of 0
the 0
JCPOA 0
argue 0
that 0
exiting 0
the 0
nuclear 0
deal 0
unless 0
it 0
is 0
changed 0
to 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration’s 0
satisfaction 0
would 0
undermine 0
U.S. 0
credibility 0
with 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
thereby 0
kill 0
any 0
chance 0
of 0
negotiations 0
to 0
resolve 0
the 0
crisis 0
caused 0
by 0
North 0
Korea's 0
continued 0
testing 0
of 0
sophisticated 0
nuclear 0
arms 0
and 0
ballistic 0
missiles. 0

"If 1
we 1
want 1
to 1
talk 1
to 1
North 1
Korea 1
now, 1
the 1
possible 1
end 1
for 1
the 1
nuclear 1
deal 1
with 1
Iran 1
would 1
jeopardize 1
the 1
credibility 1
of 1
such 1
treaties," 1
Reuters 0

German 0
Foreign 0
Minister 0
Sigmar 0

as 0

Germany 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
parties 0
to 0
the 0
JCPOA. 0

Other 0
European 0

voiced 0
similar 0

So 0
have 0
Obama’s 0
former 0
Secretaries 0
of 0

Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
John 0
Kerry. 0

This 0
argument 0
is 0
absurd 0
on 0
its 0
face. 0

The 0
whole 0
point 0
is 0
to 0
prevent 0
Iran 0
from 0
becoming 0
the 0
next 0
North 0
Korea, 0
not 0
to 1
kick 1
the 1

down 1
the 1
road 1
as 1
usual. 1

North 0
Korea’s 0
aggressive 0
pursuit 0
of 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
and 0
of 0
intercontinental 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
equipped 0
