Leeann 0 4 5
Tweeden, 0 4 5
a 0 4 5
radio 0 4 5
news 0 4 5
anchor, 0 4 5
says 0 4 5
Franken 0 4 5
groped 0 4 5
and 0 4 5
forcibly 0 4 5
kissed 0 4 5
her 0 4 5
during 0 4 5
a 0 4 5
USO 0 4 5
tour 0 4 5
in 0 4 5
2006, 0 4 5
before 0 4 5
the 0 4 5
former 0 4 5
comedian 0 4 5
was 0 4 5
a 0 4 5
senator. 0 4 5

She 0 4 6
says 0 4 6
Franken 0 4 6
"aggressively 1 4 6
stuck 1 4 6
his 1 4 6
tongue 1 4 6
in 1 4 6
my 1 4 6
mouth" 1 4 6
when 0 4 6
the 0 4 6
pair 0 4 6
rehearsed 0 4 6
a 0 4 6
skit 0 4 6
that 0 4 6
featured 0 4 6
a 0 4 6
kiss. 0 4 6

A 0 4 7
photo 0 4 7
also 0 4 7
surfaced 0 4 7
showing 0 4 7
Franken 0 4 7
looking 0 4 7
at 0 4 7
a 0 4 7
camera 0 4 7
while 0 4 7
pretending 0 4 7
to 0 4 7
grab 0 4 7
Tweeden's 0 4 7
breasts 0 4 7
as 0 4 7
she 0 4 7
was 0 4 7
sleeping 0 4 7
while 0 4 7
clothed. 0 4 7

The 0 4 8
senator 0 4 8
apologized 0 4 8
for 0 4 8
the 0 4 8
photo 0 4 8
but 0 4 8
said 0 4 8
he 0 4 8
remembered 0 4 8
the 0 4 8
skit 0 4 8
incident 0 4 8
differently. 0 4 8

Lindsay 0 4 9
Menz 0 4 9
says 0 4 9
Franken 0 4 9
grabbed 0 4 9
her 0 4 9
buttocks 0 4 9
when 0 4 9
the 0 4 9
pair 0 4 9
posed 0 4 9
for 0 4 9
a 0 4 9
photo 0 4 9
at 0 4 9
the 0 4 9
Minnesota 0 4 9
State 0 4 9
Fair 0 4 9

2010. 0 4 9

Franken 0 4 10
later 0 4 10
said 0 4 10
he 0 4 10
did 0 4 10
not 0 4 10
remember 0 4 10
taking 0 4 10
the 0 4 10
picture 0 4 10
but 0 4 10
"felt 0 4 10
badly" 0 4 10
that 0 4 10
Menz 0 4 10
felt 0 4 10
disrespected. 0 4 10

Two 0 4 11
other 0 4 11
unidentified 0 4 11
women 0 4 11
told 0 4 11
HuffPost 0 4 11
that 0 4 11
Franken 0 4 11
grabbed 0 4 11
their 0 4 11
buttocks 0 4 11
at 0 4 11
separate 0 4 11
events 0 4 11
in 0 4 11
2007 0 4 11
and 0 4 11
2008. 0 4 11

One 0 4 12
of 0 4 12
the 0 4 12
women 0 4 12
says 0 4 12
Franken 0 4 12
suggested 0 4 12
that 0 4 12
he 0 4 12
and 0 4 12
she 0 4 12
should 0 4 12
go 0 4 12
to 0 4 12
the 0 4 12
bathroom 0 4 12
together. 0 4 12

Franken 0 4 13
said 0 4 13
he 0 4 13
did 0 4 13
not 0 4 13
remember 0 4 13
the 0 4 13
events 0 4 13
and 0 4 13
denied 0 4 13
asking 0 4 13
anyone 0 4 13
to 0 4 13
visit 0 4 13
the 0 4 13
bathroom 0 4 13
with 0 4 13
him. 0 4 13

Stephanie 0 4 14
Kemplin, 0 4 14
an 0 4 14
Army 0 4 14
veteran, 0 4 14
says 0 4 14
Franken 0 4 14
put 0 4 14
his 0 4 14
hand 0 4 14
on 0 4 14
her 0 4 14
breast 0 4 14
during 0 4 14
a 0 4 14
USO 0 4 14
tour 0 4 14
in 0 4 14
2003. 0 4 14

In 0 4 15
a 0 4 15
statement 0 4 15
following 0 4 15
that 0 4 15
accusation, 0 4 15
Franken's 1 4 15
office 1 4 15
said 1 4 15
he 1 4 15
has 1 4 15
not 1 4 15
"intentionally 1 4 15
engage 1 4 15
in" 1 4 15
the 1 4 15
"kind 1 4 15
of 1 4 15
conduct" 1 4 15
described. 1 4 15

A 0 4 16
woman 0 4 16
described 0 4 16
as 0 4 16
a 0 4 16
"former 0 4 16
elected 0 4 16
official 0 4 16

New 0 4 16

told 0 4 16
the 0 4 16
Jezebel 0 4 16

that 0 4 16
Franken 0 4 16
tried 0 4 16
to 0 4 16
give 0 4 16
her 0 4 16
a 0 4 16
"wet, 1 4 16
open-mouthed 1 4 16
kiss" 1 4 16
during 0 4 16
an 0 4 16
event 0 4 16
in 0 4 16
2006. 0 4 16

The 0 4 17
senator 0 4 17
has 0 4 17
not 0 4 17
appeared 0 4 17
to 0 4 17
respond 0 4 17
specifically 0 4 17
to 0 4 17
the 0 4 17
allegation. 0 4 17

An 0 4 18
unnamed 0 4 18
former 0 4 18
Democratic 0 4 18
congressional 0 4 18
aide 0 4 18
told 0 4 18
Politico 0 4 18
that 0 4 18
the 0 4 18
senator 0 4 18
tried 0 4 18
to 0 4 18
forcibly 0 4 18
kiss 0 4 18
her 0 4 18
after 0 4 18
he 0 4 18
taped 0 4 18
a 0 4 18
radio 0 4 18
show 0 4 18
in 0 4 18
2006. 0 4 18

She 0 4 19
says 0 4 19
she 0 4 19
avoided 0 4 19
the 0 4 19
kiss, 0 4 19
then 0 4 19
heard 0 4 19
Franken 0 4 19
say 0 4 19
"it's 0 4 19
my 0 4 19
right 0 4 19
as 0 4 19
an 0 4 19
entertainer." 0 4 19

Franken 0 4 20
called 0 4 20
the 0 4 20
allegation 0 4 20
"categorically 0 4 20
not 0 4 20
true." 0 4 20

Tina 0 4 21

recent 0 6 3

days 0 6 5
later 0 6 5
on 0 6 5

she 0 6 5
confused 0 6 5
Jean’s 0 6 5
home 0 6 5

her 0 6 5
own, 0 6 5

for 0 6 5
an 0 6 5

The 0 6 7

the 0 6 7
police 0 6 7
department, 0 6 7
which 0 6 7
waited 0 6 7
days 0 6 7
to 0 6 7

went 0 6 7
weeks 0 6 7
without 0 6 7
disciplining 0 6 7
her 0 6 7
even 0 6 7
though 0 6 7
she 0 6 7
was 0 6 7
placed 0 6 7
on 0 6 7
leave. 0 6 7

“The 0 6 8

about 0 6 8

contradictory 0 6 9

last 0 6 9

why 0 6 9
she 0 6 9
could 0 6 9

She 0 6 10

“local, 0 6 10

months 0 6 11

away. 0 6 12
In 0 6 12
a 0 6 12

Hall 0 6 12
said 0 6 12
that 0 6 12
any 0 6 12

what 0 6 14
changed 0 6 14

Monday, 0 6 14

“concluded” 0 6 14
that 0 6 14
Guyger’s 0 6 14

a 0 6 14

Kavanaugh 0 7 0
Nomination 0 7 0
Is 0 7 0
Exploding 1 7 0
in 1 7 0
Trump’s 1 7 0
Face 1 7 0

The 0 7 1
president 0 7 1
is 0 7 1
doubling 0 7 1
down 0 7 1
on 0 7 1
an 0 7 1
increasingly 0 7 1
risky 0 7 1
candidate. 0 7 1

Justice 0 7 2
Anthony 0 7 2
Kennedy 0 7 2
gave 0 7 2
President 0 7 2
Donald 0 7 2
Trump 0 7 2
the 1 7 2
biggest 1 7 2
political 1 7 2
gift 1 7 2
possible 1 7 2
when 0 7 2
he 0 7 2
announced 0 7 2
his 0 7 2
resignation 0 7 2
in 0 7 2
the 0 7 2
spring. 0 7 2

Even 0 7 3
though 0 7 3
not 0 7 3
everything 0 7 3
that’s 0 7 3
gone 0 7 3
wrong 0 7 3
is 0 7 3
Trump’s 0 7 3
fault, 0 7 3
he 0 7 3
has 0 7 3
managed 0 7 3
to 0 7 3
make 0 7 3
a 0 7 3
complete 1 7 3
hash 1 7 3
of 0 7 3
Brett 0 7 3
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 3
nomination 0 7 3
to 0 7 3
fill 0 7 3
the 0 7 3
empty 0 7 3
seat 0 7 3
on 0 7 3
the 0 7 3
court. 0 7 3

It’s 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
good 0 7 4
example 0 7 4
of 0 7 4
how 1 7 4
badly 1 7 4
Trump 1 7 4
does 1 7 4
his 1 7 4
job 1 7 4
more 0 7 4
than 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
year 0 7 4
and 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
half 0 7 4
into 0 7 4
his 0 7 4
administration. 0 7 4

To 0 7 5
begin 0 7 5
with, 0 7 5
Trump 0 7 5
has 0 7 5
outsourced 0 7 5
his 0 7 5
judicial 0 7 5
nominations 0 7 5
to 0 7 5
outside, 0 7 5
party-aligned 0 7 5
groups, 0 7 5
the 0 7 5
Heritage 0 7 5
Foundation 0 7 5
and 0 7 5
the 0 7 5
Federalist 0 7 5
Society. 0 7 5

That 0 7 6
included 0 7 6
an 0 7 6
unusually 0 7 6
central 0 7 6
role 0 7 6
for 0 7 6
the 0 7 6
Federalist 0 7 6
Society’s 0 7 6
Leonard 0 7 6
Leo. 0 7 6

That 0 7 7
wasn’t 0 7 7
entirely 0 7 7
a 0 7 7
Trump 0 7 7
mistake. 0 7 7

His 0 7 8
decision 0 7 8
during 0 7 8
the 0 7 8
campaign 0 7 8
to 0 7 8
release 0 7 8
a 0 7 8
list 0 7 8
of 0 7 8
potential 0 7 8
justices 0 7 8
drafted 0 7 8
by 0 7 8
Leo 0 7 8
reflected 1 7 8
the 1 7 8
reality-TV 1 7 8
star’s 1 7 8
weakness 1 7 8
as 1 7 8
a 1 7 8
presidential 1 7 8
candidate. 1 7 8

The 0 7 9
party 0 7 9
was 0 7 9
worried 0 7 9
that 0 7 9
Trump 0 7 9
might 0 7 9
turn 0 7 9
out 0 7 9
not 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
be 0 7 9
a 0 7 9
conservative; 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
reassure 0 7 9
them, 0 7 9
he 0 7 9
publicly 0 7 9
committed 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
their 0 7 9
top 0 7 9
goal. 0 7 9

In 0 7 10
some 0 7 10
ways, 0 7 10
that’s 0 7 10
successful 0 7 10
coalition-building, 0 7 10
and 0 7 10
what 0 7 10
he’s 0 7 10
done 0 7 10
in 0 7 10
office 0 7 10
is 0 7 10
just 0 7 10
keeping 0 7 10
his 0 7 10
promises 0 7 10
on 0 7 10
judges. 0 7 10

Still, 0 7 11
it’s 0 7 11
one 0 7 11
thing 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
form 0 7 11
an 0 7 11
alliance 0 7 11
with 0 7 11
conservatives; 0 7 11
it’s 0 7 11
another 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
turn 0 7 11
the 0 7 11
whole 0 7 11
process 0 7 11
over 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
them. 0 7 11

We 0 7 12
don’t 0 7 12
know 0 7 12
to 0 7 12
what 0 7 12
extent 0 7 12
Kavanaugh 0 7 12
was 0 7 12
Trump’s 0 7 12
choice 0 7 12
and 0 7 12
to 0 7 12
what 0 7 12
extent 0 7 12
he 0 7 12
was 0 7 12
manipulated 0 7 12
into 0 7 12
choosing 0 7 12
him. 0 7 12

We 0 7 13
have 0 7 13
plenty 0 7 13
of 0 7 13
evidence 0 7 13
that 0 7 13
Trump 1 7 13
is 1 7 13
easily 1 7 13
manipulated 1 7 13
by 1 7 13
those 1 7 13
around 1 7 13
him, 1 7 13
and 0 7 13
that 0 7 13
Kavanaugh 0 7 13
is 0 7 13
a 0 7 13
good 0 7 13
fit 0 7 13
for 0 7 13
Trump’s 0 7 13
biases: 0 7 13
The 0 7 13
judge 0 7 13
has 0 7 13
Ivy 0 7 13
League 0 7 13
credentials 0 7 13
and 0 7 13
he 0 7 13
passes 0 7 13
Trump’s 0 7 13
cut-of-his-jib 1 7 13
test 1 7 13
by 0 7 13
looking 0 7 13
the 0 7 13
part. 0 7 13

1 0 7 14

Either 0 7 15
way, 0 7 15
Kavanaugh 0 7 15
was 0 7 15
a 0 7 15
poor 0 7 15
choice 0 7 15
from 0 7 15
the 0 7 15
point 0 7 15
of 0 7 15
view 0 7 15
of 0 7 15
good 0 7 15
presidenting. 0 7 15

The 0 7 16
judge 0 7 16
was 0 7 16
certain 0 7 16
to 0 7 16
be 0 7 16
a 0 7 16
highly 0 7 16
controversial 0 7 16
selection 0 7 16
from 0 7 16
the 0 7 16
start. 0 7 16

After 0 7 17
all, 0 7 17
he 0 7 17
had 0 7 17
been 0 7 17
a 0 7 17
highly 0 7 17
controversial 0 7 17
selection 0 7 17
for 0 7 17
his 0 7 17
current 0 7 17
circuit 0 7 17
court 0 7 17
seat, 0 7 17
eventually 0 7 17
getting 0 7 17
confirmed 0 7 17
with 0 7 17
only 0 7 17
four 0 7 17
Democratic 0 7 17
votes 0 7 17
after 0 7 17
a 0 7 17
long 0 7 17
delay. 0 7 17

Kavanaugh 0 7 18
is 0 7 18
a 0 7 18
longtime 0 7 18
Republican 0 7 18
operative, 0 7 18
a 0 7 18
hard-liner 0 7 18
during 0 7 18
both 0 7 18
the 0 7 18
Vince 0 7 18
Foster 0 7 18
and 0 7 18
Monica 0 7 18
Lewinsky 0 7 18
investigations. 0 7 18

Nominating 0 7 19
him, 0 7 19
rather 0 7 19
than 0 7 19
a 0 7 19
conservative 0 7 19
with 0 7 19
similar 0 7 19
views 0 7 19
but 0 7 19
a 0 7 19
different 0 7 19
background, 0 7 19
was 0 7 19
bound 0 7 19
to 0 7 19
stir 0 7 19
up 0 7 19
trouble. 0 7 19

It 0 7 20
was 0 7 20
also 0 7 20
true, 0 7 20
as 0 7 20
Senate 0 7 20
Majority 0 7 20
Leader 0 7 20
Mitch 0 7 20
McConnell 0 7 20
reportedly 0 7 20
warned, 0 7 20
that 0 7 20
normal 0 7 20
disclosure 0 7 20
of 0 7 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 20
record, 0 7 20
especially 0 7 20
his 0 7 20
service 0 7 20
during 0 7 20
the 0 7 20
George 0 7 20
W. 0 7 20
Bush 0 7 20
administration, 0 7 20
was 0 7 20
going 0 7 20
to 0 7 20
delay 0 7 20
confirmation 0 7 20
even 0 7 20
more. 0 7 20

Senate 0 7 21
Republicans 0 7 21
dealt 0 7 21
with 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
problem 0 7 21
by 0 7 21
deciding 0 7 21
to 0 7 21
not 0 7 21
bother 0 7 21
with 0 7 21
any 0 7 21
Kavanaugh 0 7 21
documents 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
couldn’t 0 7 21
be 0 7 21
produced 0 7 21
rapidly, 0 7 21
which 0 7 21
further 0 7 21
riled 0 7 21
up 0 7 21
the 0 7 21
Democrats 0 7 21
and 0 7 21
gave 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
party 0 7 21
some 0 7 21
good 0 7 21
talking 0 7 21
points. 0 7 21

2 0 7 22

Sometimes 0 7 23
it’s 0 7 23
worth 0 7 23
taking 0 7 23

risks. 0 7 24
Presidents 0 7 24
who 0 7 24
shy 0 7 24
away 0 7 24
from 0 7 24
anything 0 7 24
that’s 0 7 24
not 0 7 24
a 0 7 24
sure 0 7 24
thing 0 7 24
can 0 7 24
fail 0 7 24
to 0 7 24
exploit 0 7 24
opportunities. 0 7 24

It’s 0 7 25
just 0 7 25
very 0 7 25
hard 0 7 25
to 0 7 25
see 0 7 25
any 0 7 25
upside 0 7 25
for 0 7 25
Trump 0 7 25
in 0 7 25
choosing 0 7 25
Kavanaugh 0 7 25
instead 0 7 25
of 0 7 25
a 0 7 25
safer, 0 7 25
but 0 7 25
still 0 7 25
very 0 7 25
conservative, 0 7 25
other 0 7 25
option. 0 7 25

3 0 7 26

When 0 7 27
serious 0 7 27
charges 0 7 27
of 0 7 27
sexual 0 7 27
misconduct 0 7 27
were 0 7 27
raised 0 7 27
against 0 7 27
Kavanaugh, 0 7 27
Trump 0 7 27
decided 0 7 27
to 0 7 27
stick 0 7 27
with 0 7 27
him 0 7 27
instead 0 7 27
of 0 7 27
moving 0 7 27
on 0 7 27
to 0 7 27
another 0 7 27
candidate. 0 7 27

It’s 0 7 28
still 0 7 28
not 0 7 28
clear 0 7 28
that 0 7 28
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 28
nomination 0 7 28
is 0 7 28
doomed, 0 7 28
but 0 7 28
it’s 0 7 28
certainly 0 7 28
in 0 7 28
severe 1 7 28
trouble. 1 7 28

Losing 0 7 29
a 0 7 29
high-profile 0 7 29
fight 0 7 29
is 0 7 29
always 0 7 29
going 0 7 29
to 0 7 29
hurt 0 7 29
a 0 7 29
president, 0 7 29
which 0 7 29
is 0 7 29
why 0 7 29
they 0 7 29
should 0 7 29
take 0 7 29
care 0 7 29
to 0 7 29
avoid 0 7 29
high-risk, 0 7 29
low-reward 0 7 29
conflicts. 0 7 29

But 0 7 30
there’s 0 7 30
an 0 7 30
art 0 7 30
to 0 7 30
minimizing 0 7 30

damage. 0 7 31
And 0 7 31
Trump 1 7 31
hasn’t 1 7 31
learned 1 7 31

it 1 7 32
yet. 1 7 32
For 0 7 32
one 0 7 32
thing, 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
president 0 7 32
has 0 7 32
made 0 7 32
this 0 7 32
an 0 7 32
extremely 1 7 32
high-profile 1 7 32
episode 1 7 32
by 0 7 32
stringing 0 7 32
out 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
process 0 7 32
as 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
accusations 0 7 32
against 0 7 32
Kavanaugh 0 7 32
gained 0 7 32
credibility 0 7 32
and 0 7 32
even 0 7 32
multiplied. 0 7 32

Whether 0 7 33
that 0 7 33
matters 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
terms 0 7 33
of 0 7 33
public 0 7 33
opinion 0 7 33
for 0 7 33
Trump 0 7 33
is 0 7 33
unclear, 0 7 33
but 0 7 33
it 0 7 33
certainly 0 7 33
isn’t 0 7 33
good 0 7 33
for 0 7 33
any 0 7 33
Republican 0 7 33
senators 0 7 33
caught 0 7 33
up 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
the 0 7 33
middle, 0 7 33
along 0 7 33
with 0 7 33
any 0 7 33
other 0 7 33
candidates 0 7 33
who 0 7 33
have 0 7 33
had 0 7 33
to 0 7 33
weigh 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
only 0 7 33
to 0 7 33
find 0 7 33
the 0 7 33
facts 0 7 33
as 0 7 33
they 0 7 33
knew 0 7 33
them 0 7 33
constantly 0 7 33
changing. 0 7 33

It’s 0 7 34
also 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
case 0 7 34
that 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
more 0 7 34
negative 0 7 34
information 0 7 34
comes 0 7 34
out, 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
more 0 7 34
it 0 7 34
appears 0 7 34
that 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
Trump 1 7 34
and 1 7 34
his 1 7 34
White 1 7 34
House 1 7 34
staff 1 7 34
failed 1 7 34
to 1 7 34
do 1 7 34
their 1 7 34
jobs 1 7 34
in 0 7 34
vetting 0 7 34
and 0 7 34
managing 0 7 34
Kavanaugh. 0 7 34

If 0 7 35
the 0 7 35
nomination 0 7 35
had 0 7 35
been 0 7 35
pulled 0 7 35
right 0 7 35
after 0 7 35
Christine 0 7 35
Blasey 0 7 35
Ford 0 7 35
made 0 7 35
her 0 7 35
initial 0 7 35
assertions 0 7 35
about 0 7 35
Kavanaugh, 0 7 35
the 0 7 35
public 0 7 35
might 0 7 35
have 0 7 35
concluded 0 7 35
that 0 7 35
it 0 7 35
wasn’t 0 7 35
Trump’s 0 7 35
fault 0 7 35
that 0 7 35
a 0 7 35
previously 0 7 35
unaired 0 7 35
accusation 0 7 35
came 0 7 35

to 0 7 36
light. 0 7 36
Meanwhile, 0 7 36
Trump’s 0 7 36
behavior 0 7 36
has 0 7 36
been 0 7 36
as 0 7 36
erratic 0 7 36

as 0 7 37
ever. 0 7 37
First 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
said 0 7 37
that 0 7 37
Brasey 0 7 37
had 0 7 37
to 0 7 37
be 0 7 37
heard; 0 7 37
then 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
attacked 0 7 37
her 0 7 37
in 0 7 37
terms 0 7 37
that 0 7 37
were 0 7 37
a 1 7 37
slur 1 7 37
on 1 7 37
all 1 7 37
women 1 7 37
who 0 7 37
have 0 7 37
been 0 7 37
assaulted 0 7 37
without 0 7 37
immediately 0 7 37
reporting 0 7 37
it 0 7 37
to 0 7 37
the 0 7 37
police, 0 7 37
and 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
also 0 7 37
blamed 0 7 37
the 0 7 37
Senate 0 7 37
for 0 7 37
not 0 7 37
voting 0 7 37
before 0 7 37
she 0 7 37
came 0 7 37

forward. 0 7 38
He 0 7 38
sometimes 0 7 38
praises 0 7 38
Kavanaugh, 0 7 38
but 0 7 38
also 0 7 38
let 0 7 38
it 0 7 38
be 0 7 38
known 0 7 38
that 0 7 38
he 0 7 38
thought 0 7 38
the 0 7 38
nominee 0 7 38
had 0 7 38
performed 0 7 38
badly 0 7 38
in 0 7 38
his 0 7 38
Fox 0 7 38
News 0 7 38

interview. 0 7 39
The 0 7 39
White 0 7 39
House 0 7 39
demanded 0 7 39
a 0 7 39
final 0 7 39
up 0 7 39
and 0 7 39
down 0 7 39

he 0 7 39

saying 0 7 39
that 0 7 39
the 0 7 39
nomination 0 7 39
would 0 7 39
die 0 7 39
if 0 7 39
Kavanaugh 0 7 39

do 0 7 39
well 0 7 39
before 0 7 39
the 0 7 39
Judiciary 0 7 39
Committee 0 7 39
on 0 7 39

Thursday. 0 7 40
The 0 7 40
sum 0 7 40
of 0 7 40
all 0 7 40
this 0 7 40
has 0 7 40
been, 0 7 40
as 0 7 40
in 0 7 40
many 0 7 40
other 0 7 40
episodes, 0 7 40
that 0 7 40
Trump 0 7 40
and 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
White 0 7 40
House 0 7 40
are 0 7 40
a 1 7 40
gang 1 7 40
that 1 7 40
can’t 1 7 40
shoot 1 7 40
straight 1 7 40
and 0 7 40
that 0 7 40
he’s 0 7 40
eager 0 7 40
to 0 7 40
blame 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
allies 0 7 40
and 0 7 40
lash 0 7 40
out 0 7 40
at 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
enemies 0 7 40
in 0 7 40
ugly 1 7 40
ways 1 7 40
when 0 7 40
things 0 7 40

go 0 7 41
wrong. 0 7 41
A 0 7 41
botched 0 7 41
nomination 0 7 41
matters 0 7 41
because 0 7 41
allies 0 7 41
will 0 7 41
be 0 7 41
less 0 7 41
likely 0 7 41
to 0 7 41
trust 0 7 41
Trump, 0 7 41
not 0 7 41
just 0 7 41
on 0 7 41
Supreme 0 7 41
Court 0 7 41
choices, 0 7 41
but 0 7 41
on 0 7 41
any 0 7 41

initiative. 0 7 42
And, 0 7 42
for 0 7 42
that 0 7 42
matter, 0 7 42
they’ll 0 7 42
be 0 7 42
less 0 7 42
likely 0 7 42
to 0 7 42
trust 0 7 42
him 0 7 42
when 0 7 42
he 0 7 42
asserts 0 7 42
that 0 7 42
there’s 0 7 42
nothing 0 7 42
remaining 0 7 42
for 0 7 42
Special 0 7 42
Counsel 0 7 42
Robert 0 7 42
Mueller 0 7 42

to 0 7 43
reveal. 0 7 43
Trump’s 0 7 43
professional 0 7 43
reputation 0 7 43
is 0 7 43
already 0 7 43
terrible, 0 7 43
but 0 7 43
everything 0 7 43

counts. 0 7 44
As 1 7 44
the 1 7 44
political 1 7 44
scientist 1 7 44
Richard 1 7 44
Neustadt 1 7 44
said, 1 7 44
political 1 7 44
elites 1 7 44
are 1 7 44
constantly 1 7 44
evaluating 1 7 44
and 1 7 44
re-evaluating 1 7 44
the 1 7 44

president. 1 7 45
Trump 0 7 45
is 0 7 45
hurting 0 7 45
himself 0 7 45
right 0 7 45
now, 0 7 45
and 0 7 45
will 0 7 45
have 0 7 45
hurt 0 7 45
himself 0 7 45
more 0 7 45
if 0 7 45
Kavanaugh 0 7 45
is 0 7 45
not 0 7 45

confirmed. 0 7 46
And 0 7 46
yes, 0 7 46
I 0 7 46
call 0 7 46
it 0 7 46
the 0 7 46
cut-of-his-jib 1 7 46
test 1 7 46
quite 0 7 46
deliberately. 0 7 46

It's 0 7 47
no 0 7 47
surprise 0 7 47
that 0 7 47
someone 1 7 47
who 1 7 47
hires 1 7 47
based 1 7 47
on 1 7 47
what 1 7 47
he 1 7 47
thinks 1 7 47
someone 1 7 47
doing 1 7 47
that 1 7 47
job 1 7 47
should 1 7 47
look 1 7 47
like, 1 7 47
which 0 7 47
seems 0 7 47
to 0 7 47
be 0 7 47
based 0 7 47
on 0 7 47
hazy 1 7 47
old-time 1 7 47
Hollywood 1 7 47
casting, 1 7 47
would 0 7 47
wind 0 7 47
up 0 7 47
with 0 7 47
fewer 0 7 47
women 0 7 47
in 0 7 47
his 0 7 47
administration 0 7 47
than 0 7 47
any 0 7 47
of 0 7 47
his 0 7 47
recent 0 7 47
predecessors. 0 7 47

I've 0 7 48
argued 0 7 48
that 0 7 48
too 0 7 48
much 0 7 48
disclosure 0 7 48
is 0 7 48
required, 0 7 48
and 0 7 48
that 0 7 48
Democrats 0 7 48
(and 0 7 48
any 0 7 48
wavering 0 7 48
Republicans) 0 7 48
had 0 7 48
more 0 7 48
than 0 7 48
enough 0 7 48
information 0 7 48
to 0 7 48
make 0 7 48
up 0 7 48

their 0 7 49
mind. 0 7 49
I 0 7 49
still 0 7 49
think 0 7 49

that's 0 7 50
true. 0 7 50
But 0 7 50
it 0 7 50
did 0 7 50
leave 0 7 50
Republicans 0 7 50
vulnerable 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
claims 0 7 50
about 0 7 50
transparency 0 7 50
which 0 7 50
were 0 7 50
likely 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
be 0 7 50
popular 0 7 50
-- 0 7 50
most 0 7 50
people, 0 7 50
and 0 7 50
the 0 7 50
entire 0 7 50
press 0 7 50
corps, 0 7 50
love 0 7 50
transparency 0 7 50
-- 0 7 50
and 0 7 50
vulnerable 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
bombshells 1 7 50
in 0 7 50
the 0 7 50
documentary 0 7 50
record 0 7 50
which 0 7 50
hadn't 0 7 50
been 0 7 50
initially 0 7 50

disclosed. 0 7 51
In 0 7 51
the 0 7 51
event, 0 7 51
that's 0 7 51
not 0 7 51
what's 0 7 51
causing 0 7 51
the 0 7 51
trouble, 0 7 51
but 0 7 51
still 0 7 51
it's 0 7 51
an 0 7 51
example 0 7 51
of 0 7 51
Trump 0 7 51
taking 0 7 51
needless 0 7 51

risks. 0 7 52
Some 0 7 52
have 0 7 52
speculated 0 7 52
that 0 7 52
Kavanaugh 0 7 52
would 0 7 52
be 0 7 52
especially 0 7 52
likely 0 7 52
to 0 7 52
rule 0 7 52
in 0 7 52
Trump's 0 7 52
favor 0 7 52
if 0 7 52
any 0 7 52
cases 0 7 52
stemming 0 7 52
from 0 7 52
the 0 7 52
Robert 0 7 52
Mueller 0 7 52
investigation 0 7 52
wind 0 7 52
up 0 7 52
at 0 7 52
the 0 7 52

high 0 7 53
court. 0 7 53

Perhaps. 0 7 54
There 0 7 54
are 0 7 54
plenty 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
other 0 7 54
partisan, 1 7 54
conservative 1 7 54
judges, 1 7 54
and 0 7 54
plenty 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
conservative 0 7 54
judges 0 7 54
who 0 7 54
lean 0 7 54
towards 0 7 54
an 0 7 54
expansive 0 7 54
view 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
presidential 0 7 54

powers. 0 7 55
And 0 7 55
if 0 7 55
Kavanaugh 0 7 55
is 0 7 55
really 0 7 55
an 0 7 55
outlier 0 7 55
on 0 7 55
that 0 7 55
issue, 0 7 55
then 0 7 55
he 0 7 55
won't 0 7 55
be 0 7 55
in 0 7 55
the 0 7 55
majority 0 7 55
on 0 7 55
any 0 7 55
future 0 7 55
decision 0 7 55

anyway. 0 7 55

So, 0 7 55

no, 0 7 55

I 0 7 55

don't 0 7 55

think 0 7 55

there's 0 7 55

any 0 7 55

good 0 7 55

reason 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

think 0 7 55

Kavanaugh 0 7 55

would 0 7 55

be 0 7 55

especially 0 7 55

helpful 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

Trump 0 7 55

compared 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

others 0 7 55

he 0 7 55

could 0 7 55

have 0 7 55

selected. 0 7 55

Nearly 0 10 1
five 0 10 1
hours 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
unprecedented 1 10 1

fulsome 1 10 1
declarations 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
a 0 10 1

just 0 10 1
vague 0 10 1
pledges 0 10 1
of 0 10 1
nuclear 0 10 1
disarmament. 0 10 1

For 0 10 2
Trump, 0 10 2
that 0 10 2
amounted 0 10 2
to 0 10 2
a 0 10 2
triumphant 1 10 2
outcome 0 10 2
in 0 10 2
his 0 10 2

But 0 10 3
there 0 10 3
were 0 10 3
scant 0 10 3
details 0 10 3
on 0 10 3
what 0 10 3
new 0 10 3
commitments 0 10 3
had 0 10 3
been 0 10 3
secured 0 10 3
from 0 10 3
Kim, 0 10 3
even 0 10 3
as 0 10 3
Trump 0 10 3
announced 0 10 3

would 0 10 3
end 0 10 3
the 0 10 3

Whether 0 10 4
nuclear 0 10 4
disarmament 0 10 4
is 0 10 4
indeed 0 10 4
the 0 10 4
final 0 10 4
outcome 0 10 4
of 0 10 4
Tuesday's 0 10 4
summit 0 10 4
won't 0 10 4
be 0 10 4
known 0 10 4
for 0 10 4
years, 0 10 4
if 0 10 4
not 0 10 4
decades. 0 10 4

But 0 10 5
the 0 10 5
dramatic 1 10 5
act 0 10 5
of 0 10 5
extending 0 10 5
his 0 10 5
hand 0 10 5
to 0 10 5
one 0 10 5
of 0 10 5
America's 0 10 5
longtime 0 10 5
adversaries 0 10 5
will 0 10 5
forever 1 10 5
illustrate 0 10 5
Trump's 1 10 5
gut-driven, 1 10 5
norm-shattering 1 10 5
tenure. 1 10 5

"We 0 10 6
both 0 10 6
want 0 10 6
to 0 10 6
do 0 10 6
something. 0 10 6

We 0 10 7
both 0 10 7
are 0 10 7
going 0 10 7
to 0 10 7
do 0 10 7
something. 0 10 7

And 0 10 8
we 0 10 8
have 0 10 8
developed 0 10 8
a 0 10 8
very 0 10 8
special 0 10 8
bond," 0 10 8
Trump 0 10 8
said 0 10 8
at 0 10 8
the 0 10 8
conclusion 0 10 8
of 0 10 8
the 0 10 8
landmark 0 10 8
summit. 0 10 8

"People 1 10 9
are 1 10 9
going 1 10 9
to 1 10 9
be 1 10 9
very 1 10 9
impressed. 1 10 9

People 0 10 10
are 0 10 10
going 0 10 10
to 0 10 10
be 0 10 10
very 0 10 10
happy." 0 10 10

The 0 10 11
document 0 10 11
he 0 10 11
and 0 10 11
Kim 0 10 11
signed 0 10 11
said 0 10 11
the 0 10 11
North 0 10 11
Korean 0 10 11
leader 0 10 11
"reaffirmed 0 10 11
his 0 10 11
firm 0 10 11
and 0 10 11
unwavering 1 10 11
commitment 0 10 11
to 0 10 11
complete 0 10 11
denuclearization 0 10 11
of 0 10 11
the 0 10 11
Korean 0 10 11
Peninsula." 0 10 11

In 0 10 12
exchange, 0 10 12
Trump 0 10 12
agreed 0 10 12
to 0 10 12
"provide 0 10 12
security 0 10 12
guarantees" 0 10 12
to 0 10 12
North 0 10 12
Korea. 0 10 12

But 0 10 13
there 0 10 13
was 0 10 13
no 0 10 13
mentioning 0 10 13
the 0 10 13
previous 0 10 13
US 0 10 13
aim 0 10 13
of 0 10 13
"complete, 0 10 13
verifiable 0 10 13
and 0 10 13
irreversible 0 10 13
denuclearization." 0 10 13

And 0 10 14
Kim's 0 10 14
commitments 0 10 14
did 0 10 14
not 0 10 14
appear 0 10 14
to 0 10 14
go 0 10 14
beyond 0 10 14
what 0 10 14
he 0 10 14
already 0 10 14
pledged 0 10 14
to 0 10 14
do 0 10 14
in 0 10 14
April 0 10 14
when 0 10 14
he 0 10 14
met 0 10 14
South 0 10 14

President 0 10 14

along 0 10 14
their 0 10 14
countries' 0 10 14
border. 0 10 14

Trump 0 10 15
insisted 0 10 15
during 0 10 15
a 0 10 15
news 0 10 15
conference 0 10 15
the 0 10 15
agreement 0 10 15
went 0 10 15
further 0 10 15
than 0 10 15
many 0 10 15
people 0 10 15
expected. 0 10 15

But 0 10 16
he 0 10 16
acknowledged 0 10 16
the 0 10 16
effort 0 10 16
to 0 10 16
rid 0 10 16
North 0 10 16
Korea 0 10 16
of 0 10 16
its 0 10 16
nuclear 0 10 16
arsenal 0 10 16
was 0 10 16
in 0 10 16
its 0 10 16
early 0 10 16
stages. 0 10 16

"We 0 10 17
will 0 10 17
do 0 10 17
it 0 10 17
as 0 10 17
fast 0 10 17
as 0 10 17
it 0 10 17
can 0 10 17
mechanically 0 10 17
and 0 10 17
physically 0 10 17
be 0 10 17
done," 0 10 17
he 0 10 17
said. 0 10 17

More 0 10 18
critical, 0 10 18
in 0 10 18
Trump's 0 10 18
telling, 0 10 18
was 0 10 18
the 0 10 18
development 0 10 18
of 0 10 18
a 0 10 18
personal 0 10 18

only 0 10 18
of 0 10 18

"I 0 10 19

were 0 10 23
unmet 0 10 23
did 0 10 23
not 0 10 23
materialize. 0 10 23

Instead 0 10 24
he 0 10 24
predicted 0 10 24
he 0 10 24
could 0 10 24
"solve 0 10 24
a 0 10 24
big 1 10 24
problem, 1 10 24
a 0 10 24
big 1 10 24
dilemma" 1 10 24
alongside 0 10 24
his 0 10 24
new 0 10 24
partner. 0 10 24

"Working 1 10 25
together, 1 10 25
we'll 1 10 25
get 1 10 25
it 1 10 25
taken 1 10 25
care 1 10 25
of," 1 10 25
Trump 0 10 25
said. 0 10 25

The 0 10 26
remarks 0 10 26
came 0 10 26
amid 0 10 26
an 0 10 26
improbable 0 10 26
series 0 10 26
of 0 10 26
events 0 10 26
that 0 10 26
few 0 10 26
could 0 10 26
have 0 10 26
anticipated 0 10 26
even 0 10 26
three 0 10 26
months 0 10 26
ago. 0 10 26

The 0 10 27
unlikely 0 10 27
images 0 10 27
of 0 10 27
US 0 10 27
and 0 10 27
North 0 10 27
Korean 0 10 27
counterparts 0 10 27
engaging 0 10 27
in 0 10 27
friendly 0 10 27
dialogue 0 10 27
lent 0 10 27
the 0 10 27
day 0 10 27
an 0 10 27
air 0 10 27
of 0 10 27
unreality. 0 10 27

In 0 10 28
a 0 10 28
detailed 0 10 28
menu, 0 10 28
the 0 10 28
White 0 10 28
House 0 10 28
said 0 10 28
the 0 10 28
men 0 10 28
were 0 10 28
served 0 10 28
Häagen-Dazs 0 10 28
vanilla 0 10 28
ice 0 10 28
cream 0 10 28
for 0 10 28
dessert. 0 10 28

Other 0 10 29
unforeseen 0 10 29
events 0 10 29
also 0 10 29
surrounded 0 10 29
the 0 10 29
summit, 0 10 29
increasing 1 10 29
the 1 10 29
drama. 1 10 29

Minutes 0 10 30
before 0 10 30
the 0 10 30
historic 1 10 30
handshake, 0 10 30
Trump 0 10 30
tweeted 0 10 30
that 0 10 30
his 0 10 30
top 0 10 30
economic 0 10 30
adviser 0 10 30
Larry 0 10 30
Kudlow 0 10 30
had 0 10 30
suffered 0 10 30
a 0 10 30
heart 0 10 30
attack. 0 10 30

Immediately 0 10 31
after 0 10 31
the 0 10 31
encounter, 0 10 31
Dennis 0 10 31
Rodman 0 10 31
-- 0 10 31
one 0 10 31
of 0 10 31
the 0 10 31
only 0 10 31
Americans 0 10 31
to 0 10 31
have 0 10 31
met 0 10 31
Kim 0 10 31
-- 0 10 31
was 0 10 31
openly 0 10 31
weeping 0 10 31
while 0 10 31
being 0 10 31
interviewed 0 10 31
by 0 10 31
CNN's 0 10 31
Chris 0 10 31
Cuomo. 0 10 31

Even 0 10 32
Kim 0 10 32
seemed 0 10 32
to 0 10 32
acknowledge 0 10 32
the 0 10 32
surreality 1 10 32
of 0 10 32
the 0 10 32
day. 0 10 32

"Many 0 10 33
people 0 10 33
in 0 10 33
the 0 10 33
world 0 10 33
will 0 10 33
think 0 10 33
of 0 10 33
this 0 10 33
as 0 10 33
a 0 10 33
(inaudible) 0 10 33
form 0 10 33
of 0 10 33
fantasy 0 10 33
... 0 10 33
from 0 10 33
a 0 10 33
science 0 10 33
fiction 0 10 33
movie," 0 10 33
his 0 10 33
translator 0 10 33
was 0 10 33
overheard 0 10 33
saying 0 10 33
as 0 10 33
the 0 10 33
two 0 10 33
leaders 0 10 33
walked 0 10 33
down 0 10 33
a 0 10 33
white-columned 0 10 33
colonnade. 0 10 33

At 0 10 34
the 0 10 34
conclusion 0 10 34
of 0 10 34
the 0 10 34
summit, 0 10 34
Trump 0 10 34
hailed 1 10 34
the 0 10 34
talks 0 10 34
as 0 10 34
a 0 10 34
historic, 1 10 34
and 0 10 34
personal, 0 10 34
achievement. 0 10 34

"We 0 10 35
learned 0 10 35
a 0 10 35
lot 0 10 35
about 0 10 35
each 0 10 35
other 0 10 35
and 0 10 35
our 0 10 35
countries," 0 10 35
Trump 0 10 35
said. 0 10 35

"I 0 10 36
learned 0 10 36
he's 0 10 36
a 0 10 36
very 1 10 36
talented 1 10 36
man." 1 10 36

When 0 10 37
pressed 0 10 37
about 0 10 37
those 0 10 37
comments 0 10 37
in 0 10 37
light 0 10 37
of 0 10 37
Kim's 0 10 37
brutal 1 10 37
tactics, 0 10 37
Trump 0 10 37
continued 0 10 37
praising 1 10 37
the 0 10 37
North 0 10 37
Korean 0 10 37
leaders' 0 10 37
ability 0 10 37
to 0 10 37
run 0 10 37
a 0 10 37
country 0 10 37
at 0 10 37
a 0 10 37
young 0 10 37
age. 0 10 37

"He 0 10 38
is 0 10 38
very 1 10 38
talented," 1 10 38
Trump 0 10 38
said, 0 10 38
citing 0 10 38
Kim's 0 10 38
ability 0 10 38
to 0 10 38
"take 0 10 38
over 0 10 38
a 0 10 38
situation 0 10 38
like 0 10 38
he 0 10 38
did 0 10 38
at 0 10 38
26 0 10 38
years 0 10 38
of 0 10 38
age 0 10 38
and 0 10 38
run 0 10 38
it, 0 10 38
and 0 10 38
run 0 10 38
it 0 10 38
tough." 0 10 38

Kim 0 10 39
assumed 0 10 39
power 0 10 39
after 0 10 39
his 0 10 39
father 0 10 39
Kim 0 10 39
Jong 0 10 39
Il, 0 10 39
also 0 10 39
a 0 10 39
brutal 1 10 39
dictator, 1 10 39
died 0 10 39
in 0 10 39
2011. 0 10 39

Throughout 0 10 40
the 0 10 40
day, 0 10 40
Trump 0 10 40
and 0 10 40
Kim's 0 10 40
body 0 10 40
language 0 10 40
was 0 10 40
openly 0 10 40
friendly, 0 10 40
a 0 10 40
striking 1 10 40
warmth 0 10 40
given 0 10 40
Kim's 0 10 40
iron 0 10 40
grip 0 10 40
on 0 10 40
power 0 10 40
and 0 10 40
dismal 0 10 40
record 0 10 40
on 0 10 40
human 0 10 40
rights. 0 10 40

Trump's 0 10 41
move 0 10 41
to 0 10 41
meet 0 10 41
him 0 10 41
attracted 0 10 41
fierce 1 10 41
criticism 1 10 41
for 0 10 41
normalizing 0 10 41
a 0 10 41
regime 0 10 41
routinely 0 10 41
called 0 10 41
out 0 10 41
for 0 10 41
its 0 10 41
human 0 10 41
rights 0 10 41
abuses, 0 10 41
that 0 10 41
over 0 10 41
years 0 10 41
has 0 10 41
built 0 10 41
an 0 10 41
image 0 10 41
of 0 10 41
fearsome 1 10 41
renegade 1 10 41
regime, 0 10 41
throwing 0 10 41
around 0 10 41
threats 0 10 41
of 0 10 41
nuclear 0 10 41
war. 0 10 41

The 0 10 42
day 0 10 42
began 0 10 42
with 0 10 42
Trump 0 10 42
patting 0 10 42
Kim 0 10 42
on 0 10 42
the 0 10 42
back 0 10 42
and 0 10 42
placing 0 10 42
his 0 10 42
hand 0 10 42
on 0 10 42
the 0 10 42
North 0 10 42
Korean's 0 10 42
shoulder 0 10 42
as 0 10 42
they 0 10 42
walked 0 10 42
into 0 10 42
their 0 10 42
first 0 10 42
meeting. 0 10 42

Later 0 10 43
they 0 10 43
were 0 10 43
seen 0 10 43
smiling 0 10 43
and 0 10 43
laughing 0 10 43
over 0 10 43
lunch. 0 10 43

Trump 0 10 44
told 0 10 44
reporters 0 10 44
he 0 10 44
would 0 10 44
"absolutely" 1 10 44
extend 0 10 44
an 0 10 44
invitation 0 10 44
to 0 10 44
the 0 10 44
White 0 10 44
House 0 10 44
to 0 10 44
Kim, 0 10 44
who 0 10 44
also 0 10 44
heralded 1 10 44
a 1 10 44
new 1 10 44
era. 1 10 44

"Today, 0 10 45
we 0 10 45
had 0 10 45
a 0 10 45
historic 1 10 45
meeting 0 10 45
and 0 10 45
decided 0 10 45
to 0 10 45
leave 0 10 45
the 0 10 45
past 0 10 45
behind," 0 10 45
Kim 0 10 45
said 0 10 45
through 0 10 45
a 0 10 45
translator. 0 10 45

"The 1 10 46
world 1 10 46
will 0 10 46
see 0 10 46
a 0 10 46
major 0 10 46
change." 0 10 46

The 0 10 47
meeting 0 10 47
came 0 10 47
only 0 10 47
months 0 10 47
after 0 10 47
the 0 10 47
two 0 10 47
men 0 10 47
traded 0 10 47
nuclear 0 10 47
taunts, 0 10 47
ratcheting 0 10 47
up 0 10 47
tensions 0 10 47
and 0 10 47
leading 0 10 47
to 0 10 47
fears 0 10 47
of 0 10 47
war. 0 10 47

By 0 10 48
contrast, 0 10 48
Trump 0 10 48
appeared 0 10 48
to 0 10 48
back 0 10 48
off 0 10 48
a 0 10 48
military 0 10 48
footing 0 10 48
on 0 10 48
Tuesday, 0 10 48
declaring 0 10 48
the 0 10 48
US 0 10 48
will 0 10 48
stop 0 10 48
the 0 10 48
"war 0 10 48
games," 0 10 48
an 0 10 48
apparent 0 10 48
reference 0 10 48
to 0 10 48
joint 0 10 48
military 0 10 48
exercises 0 10 48
with 0 10 48
South 0 10 48
Korea 0 10 48
that 0 10 48
North 0 10 48
Korea 0 10 48
has 0 10 48
long 0 10 48
rebuked 0 10 48
as 0 10 48
provocative. 0 10 48

Trump 0 10 49
also 0 10 49
said 0 10 49
he 0 10 49
hopes 0 10 49
to 0 10 49
eventually 0 10 49
withdraw 0 10 49
US 0 10 49
forces 0 10 49
from 0 10 49
South 0 10 49
Korea, 0 10 49
but 0 10 49
said 0 10 49
"that's 0 10 49
not 0 10 49
part 0 10 49
of 0 10 49
the 0 10 49
equation 0 10 49
right 0 10 49
now." 0 10 49

"I 0 10 50
want 0 10 50
to 0 10 50
get 0 10 50
our 1 10 50
soldiers 1 10 50
out. 0 10 50

I 0 10 51
want 0 10 51
to 0 10 51
bring 0 10 51
our 1 10 51
soldiers 1 10 51
back 0 10 51
home," 0 10 51
Trump 0 10 51
said. 0 10 51

"But 0 10 52
that's 0 10 52
not 0 10 52
part 0 10 52
of 0 10 52
the 0 10 52
equation 0 10 52
right 0 10 52
now. 0 10 52

I 0 10 53
hope 0 10 53
it 0 10 53
will 0 10 53
be 0 10 53
eventually." 0 10 53

Tuesday's 0 10 54
meeting, 0 10 54
convened 0 10 54
at 0 10 54
a 0 10 54
luxury 0 10 54
hotel 0 10 54
on 0 10 54
the 0 10 54
island 0 10 54
of 0 10 54
Sentosa, 0 10 54
came 0 10 54
just 0 10 54
three 0 10 54
months 0 10 54
after 0 10 54
Trump 0 10 54
accepted 0 10 54
North 0 10 54
Korea's 0 10 54
invitation 0 10 54
for 0 10 54
talks 0 10 54
on 0 10 54
the 0 10 54
spot. 0 10 54

It 0 10 55
was 0 10 55
an 0 10 55
extraordinarily 0 10 55
compressed 0 10 55
timeline 0 10 55
for 0 10 55
the 0 10 55
landmark 0 10 55
summit, 0 10 55
which 0 10 55
at 0 10 55
one 0 10 55
point 0 10 55
was 0 10 55
called 0 10 55
off 0 10 55
entirely 0 10 55
as 0 10 55
communication 0 10 55
broke 0 10 55
down 0 10 55
between 0 10 55
Washington 0 10 55
and 0 10 55
Pyongyang. 0 10 55

The 0 10 56
talks 0 10 56
were 0 10 56
quickly 0 10 56
revived, 0 10 56
leading 0 10 56
to 0 10 56
the 0 10 56
highly 0 10 56
choreographed 0 10 56
event 0 10 56
that 0 10 56
unfolded 0 10 56
Tuesday. 0 10 56

After 0 10 57
the 0 10 57
men 0 10 57
shook 0 10 57
hands, 0 10 57
they 0 10 57
repaired 0 10 57
inside 0 10 57
for 0 10 57
one-on-one 0 10 57
talks. 0 10 57

In 0 10 58
that 0 10 58
first 0 10 58
meeting 0 10 58
they 0 10 58
were 0 10 58
joined 0 10 58
only 0 10 58
by 0 10 58
translators, 0 10 58
a 0 10 58
break 0 10 58
from 0 10 58
standard 0 10 58
practice 0 10 58
of 0 10 58
having 0 10 58
at 0 10 58
least 0 10 58
one 0 10 58
aide 0 10 58
present 0 10 58
for 0 10 58
high-stakes 0 10 58
huddles. 0 10 58

Later 0 10 59
in 0 10 59
the 0 10 59
day, 0 10 59
advisers 0 10 59
joined 0 10 59
the 0 10 59
talks 0 10 59
for 0 10 59
a 0 10 59
larger 0 10 59
bilateral 0 10 59
session 0 10 59
and 0 10 59
a 0 10 59
working 0 10 59
lunch. 0 10 59

Trump 0 10 60
took 0 10 60
keen 0 10 60
interest 0 10 60
in 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
pageantry 0 10 60
of 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
day, 0 10 60
insisting 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
pictures 0 10 60
beamed 0 10 60
around 0 10 60
the 0 10 60
world 0 10 60
reflect 0 10 60
a 0 10 60
commanding 1 10 60
leader 1 10 60
making 0 10 60
a 0 10 60
decisive, 0 10 60
world-altering 1 10 60
move. 0 10 60

At 0 10 61
the 0 10 61
same 0 10 61
time, 0 10 61
he'd 0 10 61
admitted 0 10 61
he 0 10 61
didn't 0 10 61
believe 0 10 61
he 0 10 61
required 0 10 61
extensive 0 10 61
preparation 0 10 61
to 0 10 61
take 0 10 61
stock 0 10 61
of 0 10 61
Kim. 0 10 61

As 0 10 62
part 0 10 62
of 0 10 62
the 0 10 62
advance 0 10 62
work, 0 10 62
Trump 0 10 62
commissioned 0 10 62

that 0 11 16

“My 0 11 17

Trenton’s 0 11 21

also 0 11 21

“I 0 11 22

it’s 0 11 22
a 0 11 22
great 0 11 22

mainly 0 11 22
because 0 11 22
it’s 0 11 22

Courtney 0 11 25
Tolliver, 0 11 25

a 0 11 25
teacher 0 11 25
in 0 11 25
the 0 11 25
district, 0 11 25
agrees. 0 11 25

“It’s 0 11 26
not 0 11 26
teaching 0 11 26
religion, 0 11 26

it 0 11 26
teaches 0 11 26
character 0 11 26

how 0 11 26

she 0 11 26

said. 0 11 27
“The 0 11 27

the 0 11 28

the 0 11 28
suit 0 11 28

their 0 11 28

that 0 11 28
the 0 11 28

shouldn’t 0 11 28

The 0 11 29

that 0 11 29

historical 0 11 29

fact. 0 11 30
The 0 11 30
suit 0 11 30
quotes 0 11 30
from 0 11 30
one 0 11 30
lesson: 0 11 30
“If 0 11 30
all 0 11 30
of 0 11 30
the 0 11 30

chosen 0 11 30
to 0 11 30
follow 0 11 30
the 0 11 30

how 0 11 30

Another 0 11 30

to 0 11 30
imagine 0 11 30
that 0 11 30
humans 0 11 30

existed 0 11 30
at 0 11 30
the 0 11 30
same 0 11 30

time. 0 11 31
It 0 11 31
says: 0 11 31
“So 0 11 31

the 0 11 37

out. 0 11 38
Her 0 11 38

a 0 11 39

Bypassing 1 11 39
the 1 11 39

left 1 11 39
her 1 11 39
vulnerable 1 11 39

bullying. 1 11 40
Deal 0 11 40
said 0 11 40
other 0 11 40
students 0 11 40
told 0 11 40
her 0 11 40

that 0 11 40
she 0 11 40
was 0 11 40
going 1 11 40

to 1 11 41
hell. 1 11 41
One 0 11 41
day 0 11 41
a 0 11 41
student 0 11 41
saw 0 11 41
her 0 11 41
daughter 0 11 41
reading 0 11 41
a 0 11 41
“Harry 0 11 41

novel 0 11 41
and 0 11 41
told 0 11 41
her, 0 11 41
according 0 11 41
to 0 11 41
the 0 11 41
mother: 0 11 41
“You 1 11 41
don’t 1 11 41

this. 1 11 42

Eventually 0 11 43

said 0 11 45
she 0 11 45
joined 0 11 45
the 0 11 45

she 0 11 45

“When 0 11 46

The 0 12 2
Trump 0 12 2
administration 0 12 2
stood 0 12 2
down 0 12 2
on 0 12 2
Monday 0 12 2
from 0 12 2
its 0 12 2
nearly 0 12 2
two-week-long 0 12 2
dispute 0 12 2
with 0 12 2

over 0 12 2
the 0 12 2

credentials 0 12 2
of 0 12 2
Mr. 0 12 2

informing 0 12 2
the 0 12 2
correspondent 0 12 2
that 0 12 2
his 0 12 2

was 0 12 2
formally 0 12 2
restored. 0 12 2

CNN 0 12 3
in 0 12 3
turn 0 12 3
dropped 0 12 3
its 0 12 3
lawsuit 0 12 3
on 0 12 3
the 0 12 3
matter, 0 12 3
which 0 12 3
had 0 12 3
ballooned 1 12 3
into 0 12 3
a 0 12 3
test 0 12 3
of 0 12 3
press 0 12 3
freedoms 0 12 3
in 0 12 3
the 0 12 3
Trump 0 12 3
era. 0 12 3

But 0 12 4
while 0 12 4
it 0 12 4
yielded 0 12 4
to 0 12 4
Mr. 0 12 4
Acosta 0 12 4
— 0 12 4
whose 0 12 4
testy 1 12 4
questions 0 12 4
had 0 12 4
touched 0 12 4
off 0 12 4
Mr. 0 12 4
Trump’s 0 12 4
ire 1 12 4
— 0 12 4
the 0 12 4
administration 0 12 4
used 0 12 4
the 0 12 4
occasion 0 12 4
to 0 12 4
lay 0 12 4
down 0 12 4
a 0 12 4
set 0 12 4
of 0 12 4
formal 0 12 4
rules 0 12 4
governing 0 12 4
reporters’ 0 12 4
behavior 0 12 4
at 0 12 4
future 0 12 4
White 0 12 4
House 0 12 4
news 0 12 4
conferences, 0 12 4
a 0 12 4
highly 0 12 4
unusual 0 12 4
step. 0 12 4

Among 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
guidelines 0 12 5
was 0 12 5
a 0 12 5
restriction 0 12 5
of 0 12 5
one 0 12 5
question 0 12 5
per 0 12 5
reporter, 0 12 5
with 0 12 5
follow-ups 0 12 5
allowed 0 12 5
at 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
discretion 0 12 5
of 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
president 0 12 5
or 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
White 0 12 5
House 0 12 5
official 0 12 5
at 0 12 5
the 0 12 5
lectern. 0 12 5

“Failure 0 12 6
to 0 12 6
abide,” 0 12 6
the 0 12 6
administration 0 12 6
warned, 0 12 6
“may 0 12 6
result 0 12 6
in 0 12 6
suspension 0 12 6
or 0 12 6
revocation 0 12 6
of 0 12 6
the 0 12 6
journalist’s 0 12 6
hard 0 12 6
pass.” 0 12 6

The 0 12 7
White 0 12 7
House 0 12 7
sought 0 12 7
to 0 12 7
blame 0 12 7
Mr. 0 12 7
Acosta 0 12 7
for 0 12 7
behaving 0 12 7
disrespectfully, 0 12 7
although 0 12 7
Mr. 0 12 7
Trump 0 12 7
often 0 12 7
lobs 0 12 7
insults 1 12 7
at 0 12 7
journalists 0 12 7
and 0 12 7
encourages 0 12 7
a 0 12 7
free-for-all 0 12 7
format 0 12 7
when 0 12 7
taking 0 12 7
questions 0 12 7
from 0 12 7
reporters. 0 12 7

Codifying 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
behavior 0 12 8
of 0 12 8
journalists 0 12 8
struck 0 12 8
some 0 12 8
as 0 12 8
an 0 12 8
ominous 1 12 8
encroachment 1 12 8
into 0 12 8
freedom 0 12 8
of 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
press, 0 12 8
and 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
White 0 12 8
House 0 12 8
Correspondents’ 0 12 8
Association 0 12 8
said 0 12 8
on 0 12 8
Monday 0 12 8
that 0 12 8
it 0 12 8
had 0 12 8
not 0 12 8
been 0 12 8
consulted 0 12 8
about 0 12 8
the 0 12 8
new 0 12 8
guidelines. 0 12 8

The 0 12 9
American 0 12 9
Civil 0 12 9
Liberties 0 12 9
Union, 0 12 9
in 0 12 9
a 0 12 9
statement, 0 12 9
said: 0 12 9
“These 0 12 9
rules 0 12 9
give 0 12 9
the 0 12 9
White 0 12 9
House 0 12 9
far 0 12 9
too 0 12 9
much 0 12 9
discretion 0 12 9
to 0 12 9
avoid 0 12 9
real 0 12 9
scrutiny. 0 12 9

The 0 12 10
White 0 12 10
House 0 12 10
belongs 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
public, 0 12 10
not 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
president, 0 12 10
and 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
job 0 12 10
of 0 12 10
the 0 12 10
press 0 12 10
is 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
ask 0 12 10
hard 0 12 10
questions, 0 12 10
not 0 12 10
to 0 12 10
be 0 12 10
polite 0 12 10
company.” 0 12 10

Still, 0 12 11
the 0 12 11
guidelines 0 12 11
are 0 12 11
not 0 12 11
far 0 12 11
removed 0 12 11
from 0 12 11
the 0 12 11
manner 0 12 11
in 0 12 11
which 0 12 11
White 0 12 11
House 0 12 11
news 0 12 11
conferences 0 12 11
typically 0 12 11
proceed. 0 12 11

Mr. 0 12 12
Trump 0 12 12
made 0 12 12
clear 0 12 12
last 0 12 12
week 0 12 12
that 0 12 12
he 0 12 12
would 0 12 12
introduce 0 12 12
“regulations” 0 12 12
after 0 12 12
a 0 12 12
federal 0 12 12
judge 0 12 12
criticized 0 12 12
the 0 12 12
White 0 12 12
House 0 12 12
for 0 12 12
stripping 0 12 12
Mr. 0 12 12
Acosta’s 0 12 12
credentials 0 12 12
without 0 12 12
due 0 12 12
process 0 12 12
or 0 12 12
a 0 12 12
coherent 0 12 12
rationale. 0 12 12

“We 0 12 13
would 0 12 13
have 0 12 13
greatly 0 12 13
preferred 0 12 13
to 0 12 13
continue 0 12 13
hosting 0 12 13
White 0 12 13
House 0 12 13
press 0 12 13
conferences 0 12 13
in 0 12 13

of 0 12 13
understood 0 12 13

we 0 12 13

the 0 12 13
overwhelming 0 12 13

of 0 12 13
journalists 0 12 13
covering 0 12 13

that 0 12 13
preference,” 0 12 13
Sarah 0 12 13
Huckabee 0 12 13
Sanders, 0 12 13
the 0 12 13
press 0 12 13
secretary, 0 12 13
said 0 12 13
in 0 12 13
a 0 12 13
statement. 0 12 13

Press 0 12 14
relations 0 12 14
were 0 12 14
not 0 12 14
always 0 12 14
rosy 0 12 14
in 0 12 14
pre-Trump 0 12 14

days. 0 12 15
President 0 12 15
Barack 0 12 15
Obama’s 0 12 15
aides 0 12 15
preselected 0 12 15
the 0 12 15
news 0 12 15
outlets 0 12 15
that 0 12 15
were 0 12 15
allowed 0 12 15
to 0 12 15
ask 0 12 15
questions 0 12 15
at 0 12 15
his 0 12 15
news 0 12 15
conferences. 0 12 15

Mr. 0 12 16
Obama 0 12 16
often 0 12 16
chastised 0 12 16
reporters, 0 12 16
including 0 12 16
Mr. 0 12 16
Acosta 0 12 16
on 0 12 16
one 0 12 16
occasion, 0 12 16
for 0 12 16
questions 0 12 16
he 0 12 16
deemed 0 12 16
overly 1 12 16
aggressive 1 12 16
or 0 12 16
grandstanding. 1 12 16

But 0 12 17
Mr. 0 12 17
Trump, 0 12 17
a 0 12 17
devoted 1 12 17
news 1 12 17
consumer 1 12 17
who 0 12 17
relishes 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
coverage, 0 12 17
plays 0 12 17
up 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
conflicts 0 12 17
with 0 12 17
reporters 0 12 17
in 0 12 17
part 0 12 17
to 0 12 17
excite 0 12 17
his 0 12 17
supporters. 0 12 17

He 0 12 18
has 0 12 18
held 0 12 18
far 0 12 18
fewer 0 12 18
formal 0 12 18
news 0 12 18
conferences 0 12 18
than 0 12 18
his 0 12 18

the 0 12 18
daily 0 12 18
White 0 12 18

briefing 0 12 18
has 0 12 18
virtually 0 12 18

Mr. 0 12 19
Acosta’s 0 12 19
White 0 12 19
House 0 12 19

was 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
most 0 12 19
severe 1 12 19
step 0 12 19
yet, 0 12 19
and 0 12 19
it 0 12 19
soon 0 12 19
became 0 12 19
apparent 0 12 19
that 0 12 19
the 0 12 19
move 0 12 19
would 0 12 19
not 0 12 19

Mr. 0 12 19

his 0 12 19

by 0 12 19
a 0 12 19
federal 0 12 19

A 0 12 20
back-and-forth 0 12 20

over 0 12 20
the 0 12 20

a 0 12 21
letter 0 12 21
to 0 12 21
Mr. 0 12 21
Acosta 0 12 21
that 0 12 21
listed 0 12 21
several 0 12 21
reasons 0 12 21
that 0 12 21
his 0 12 21
pass 0 12 21
had 0 12 21
been 0 12 21
revoked, 0 12 21
perhaps 0 12 21
an 0 12 21
attempt 0 12 21
to 0 12 21
satisfy 0 12 21
the 0 12 21
judge’s 0 12 21
request 0 12 21
for 0 12 21
a 0 12 21
clear 0 12 21
rationale. 0 12 21

CNN’s 0 12 22

called 0 12 22
the 0 12 22
note 0 12 22
an 0 12 22
“after-the-fact 0 12 22

By 0 12 22
Monday 0 12 22

the 0 12 22

Aides 0 12 23
to 0 12 23
Mr. 0 12 23

say 0 12 23
that 0 12 23

does 0 12 23
not 0 12 23
mind 0 12 23
answering 0 12 23
questions, 0 12 23
pointing 0 12 23
to 0 12 23
his 0 12 23
numerous 0 12 23
impromptu 0 12 23
sessions 0 12 23

that 0 12 25
the 0 12 25

was 0 12 25
on 0 12 25
the 0 12 25

that 0 12 25
a 0 12 25

said 1 14 13
that 1 14 13
while 1 14 13

the 0 14 17

that 0 14 17

the 0 14 18
1940s 0 14 18
and 0 14 18
’50s 0 14 18
by 0 14 18
providing 0 14 18
something 0 14 18
of 0 14 18
a 0 14 18
religious 0 14 18
answer 0 14 18
to 0 14 18
antiblack 0 14 18

racism. 0 14 19
It 0 14 19
was 0 14 19
not 0 14 19
widely 0 14 19
recognized 0 14 19
as 0 14 19
an 0 14 19
anti-Jewish 0 14 19
organization 0 14 19
during 0 14 19
its 0 14 19
early 0 14 19
years 0 14 19
(its 0 14 19
early 0 14 19
literature, 0 14 19
though, 0 14 19
focused 0 14 19
on 0 14 19
“the 1 14 19
white 1 14 19
man” 1 14 19
as 1 14 19
“the 1 14 19
white 1 14 19
devil”). 1 14 19

But 0 14 20
in 0 14 20
1967, 0 14 20
it 0 14 20
became 0 14 20
outspokenly 1 14 20
and 1 14 20
flagrantly 1 14 20
anti-Zionist, 1 14 20
in 0 14 20
an 0 14 20

That 0 14 21
political 0 14 21
position 0 14 21
became 0 14 21
a 0 14 21
vehicle 0 14 21
for 0 14 21
Mr. 0 14 21
Farrakhan 0 14 21
to 0 14 21
express 0 14 21
his 0 14 21
anti-Semitism. 0 14 21

(Among 0 14 22
his 0 14 22
more 0 14 22
infamous 0 14 22

is 0 14 22
his 1 14 22

In 0 14 23
1975, 0 14 23

the 0 14 23

split 0 14 23
into 0 14 23
two 0 14 23

The 0 14 24
faction 0 14 24

in 0 14 24
the 0 14 24

that 0 14 24
it 0 14 24
had 0 14 24
when 0 14 24
its 0 14 24

Mr. 0 14 25

said 0 14 25
that 0 14 25
today 0 14 25
the 0 14 25

the 0 14 25

there 0 14 25
could 0 14 25
even 0 14 25
be 0 14 25

after 0 14 26
the 0 14 26
February 0 14 26

is 0 14 26
“virtually 0 14 26
synonymous 0 14 26
with 0 14 26
anti-Semitism,” 0 14 26
then 0 14 26
drew 0 14 26
national 0 14 26
attention 0 14 26
in 0 14 26
1984, 0 14 26
when 0 14 26
he 0 14 26

In 0 14 27
a 0 14 27

Mr. 0 14 28
Jackson 0 14 28
repudiated 0 14 28
Mr. 0 14 28
Farrakhan, 0 14 28
but 0 14 28
the 0 14 28
minister’s 0 14 28

Obama's 0 17 5
disastrous 1 17 5
nuclear 0 17 5
deal 0 17 5
with 0 17 5
Iran 0 17 5
legitimized 1 17 5
Iran's 1 17 5
path 1 17 5
to 1 17 5
eventually 1 17 5
becoming 1 17 5
a 1 17 5
nuclear-armed 1 17 5

immediately 0 17 5

dollars 0 17 5
to 0 17 5
fund 0 17 5
its 0 17 5
aggression. 0 17 5

Meanwhile, 0 17 6
Syria 0 17 6
has 0 17 6
become 0 17 6
ground 0 17 6
zero 0 17 6
for 0 17 6
Iran's 0 17 6
execution 0 17 6
of 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
regional 0 17 6
ambitions, 0 17 6
which 0 17 6
is 0 17 6
to 0 17 6
establish 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
Shiite 0 17 6
Crescent 0 17 6
connecting 0 17 6
with 0 17 6
its 0 17 6
allies, 0 17 6
including 0 17 6
Iraq, 0 17 6
Syria 0 17 6
and 0 17 6
Lebanon. 0 17 6

This 0 17 7
plan 0 17 7
has 0 17 7
included 0 17 7
the 0 17 7
establishment 0 17 7
of 0 17 7
a 0 17 7
land 0 17 7
route 0 17 7
that 0 17 7
Iranian-backed 0 17 7
militias 0 17 7
secured 0 17 7
in 0 17 7
June, 0 17 7
beginning 0 17 7
on 0 17 7
Iran’s 0 17 7
border 0 17 7
with 0 17 7
Iraq 0 17 7
and 0 17 7
running 0 17 7
across 0 17 7
Iraq 0 17 7
and 0 17 7
Syria 0 17 7
all 0 17 7
the 0 17 7
way 0 17 7
to 0 17 7
Syria’s 0 17 7
Mediterranean 0 17 7
coast. 0 17 7

This 0 17 8
road 0 17 8
makes 0 17 8
Iran’s 0 17 8
job 0 17 8
easier 0 17 8
in 0 17 8
supplying 0 17 8
arms 0 17 8
by 0 17 8
land, 0 17 8
as 0 17 8
well 0 17 8
as 0 17 8
by 0 17 8
air 0 17 8
and 0 17 8
sea, 0 17 8
to 0 17 8
prop 0 17 8
up 0 17 8
Syrian 0 17 8
President 0 17 8
Bashar 0 17 8
al-Assad’s 0 17 8
regime 0 17 8
and 0 17 8
to 0 17 8
equip 0 17 8
Iran’s 0 17 8
own 0 17 8
forces 0 17 8
fighting 0 17 8
inside 0 17 8
of 0 17 8
Syria 0 17 8
in 0 17 8
support 0 17 8
of 0 17 8
Assad. 0 17 8

This 0 17 9
helps 0 17 9
explain 0 17 9
why 0 17 9
Iran 0 17 9
has 0 17 9
placed 0 17 9
so 0 17 9
much 0 17 9
importance 0 17 9
on 0 17 9
helping 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Syrian 0 17 9
regime 0 17 9
establish 0 17 9
control 0 17 9
over 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Deir 0 17 9
ez-Zor 0 17 9
area 0 17 9
in 0 17 9
eastern 0 17 9
Syria, 0 17 9
near 0 17 9
the 0 17 9
Iraqi 0 17 9
border. 0 17 9

“Everything 0 17 10
depends 0 17 10
now 0 17 10
on 0 17 10
the 0 17 10
Americans’ 0 17 10
willingness 0 17 10
to 0 17 10
stop 0 17 10
this,” 0 17 10

an 0 17 10
Iraqi 0 17 10

However, 0 17 11
U.S.-led 0 17 11

forces 0 17 11
apparently 0 17 11
have 0 17 11

next 0 17 11
to 0 17 11
nothing 0 17 11

in 0 17 11

“Obama 0 17 12

Syria 0 17 12
so 0 17 12
thoroughly, 0 17 12
by 0 17 12
the 0 17 12
time 0 17 12
this 0 17 12

“The 0 17 13
Iranian 0 17 13
influence 0 17 13
is 0 17 13
spreading 0 17 13
because 0 17 13
they 0 17 13
are 0 17 13

added. 0 17 13

“It’s 1 17 14
a 1 17 14
new 1 17 14

Furthermore, 0 17 15
Iran 0 17 15
has 0 17 15
funded 0 17 15

forces. 0 17 15

And 0 17 16
Iran 0 17 16
has 0 17 16
used 0 17 16
Syria 0 17 16
as 0 17 16
a 0 17 16
transit 0 17 16
point 0 17 16

Despite 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
fact 0 17 17
that 0 17 17
Hezbollah 0 17 17
has 0 17 17
American 1 17 17

on 0 17 17
its 0 17 17
hands, 0 17 17
the 0 17 17
U.S.-led 0 17 17
coalition 0 17 17
has 0 17 17
chosen 0 17 17
not 0 17 17
to 0 17 17
do 0 17 17
anything 0 17 17
about 0 17 17
Hezbollah’s 0 17 17

sides 0 17 18
in 0 17 18

on 0 17 19
September 0 17 19

Israeli 0 17 19

Israel 0 17 20
will 0 17 20
also 0 17 20
do 0 17 20
what 0 17 20
is 0 17 20
necessary 0 17 20
to 0 17 20
repel 0 17 20

shrinking 0 17 20
the 0 17 20

between 0 17 20
Israel 0 17 20
and 0 17 20
Iranian 0 17 20
controlled 0 17 20
territories. 0 17 20

However, 0 17 21
such 0 17 21
tactical 0 17 21
measures 0 17 21
may 0 17 21
not 0 17 21
be 0 17 21
enough 0 17 21
to 0 17 21
thwart 0 17 21
Iran’s 0 17 21

light 0 17 22
of 0 17 22

reports 0 17 22
that 0 17 22

Israeli 0 17 22

concluded 0 17 22
that 0 17 22
they 0 17 22
cannot 0 17 22
wait 0 17 22
until 0 17 22
the 0 17 22

decides 0 17 22
to 0 17 22
deal 0 17 22
more 0 17 22
forcefully 0 17 22
with 0 17 22
Iran's 0 17 22

“Their 0 17 23

At 0 17 25

Israel 0 17 25
has 0 17 25
a 0 17 25

a 0 18 6

that 0 18 6

The 0 18 7

how 0 18 7
some 0 18 7
people 0 18 7
in 0 18 7
the 0 18 7

were 0 18 7
warned 0 18 7
45 0 18 7
minutes 0 18 7
before 0 18 7
the 0 18 7
shooting 0 18 7
that 0 18 7
they 0 18 7
were 0 18 7
going 0 18 7
to 0 18 7
die, 0 18 7
suggesting 0 18 7
that 0 18 7
this 0 18 7
was 0 18 7
evidence 0 18 7
of 0 18 7
a 0 18 7

not 0 18 7
a 0 18 7

attack. 0 18 7

As 0 18 8
a 0 18 8
firearms 0 18 8

he 0 18 8
also 0 18 8

Although 0 18 10
the 0 18 10
claims 0 18 10
are 0 18 10
intriguing, 0 18 10
it 0 18 10
is 0 18 10
important 0 18 10
to 0 18 10
remember 0 18 10
that 0 18 10
after 1 18 10
virtually 1 18 10
every 1 18 10
terror 1 18 10
attack 1 18 10
and 1 18 10
mass 1 18 10
shooting, 1 18 10
friends 1 18 10
and 1 18 10
neighbors 1 18 10
express 1 18 10
shock 1 18 10
that 0 18 10
the 0 18 10
culprit 0 18 10
would 0 18 10
be 0 18 10
capable 0 18 10
of 0 18 10
carrying 0 18 10
out 0 18 10
such 0 18 10
horrors, 0 18 10
with 0 18 10
some 0 18 10
outright 0 18 10
denying 0 18 10
it 0 18 10
to 0 18 10
be 0 18 10
possible. 0 18 10

If 0 18 11
Paddock 0 18 11
was 0 18 11
planning 0 18 11
such 0 18 11
a 0 18 11
sophisticated 0 18 11
operation 0 18 11
and 0 18 11
hoping 0 18 11
to 0 18 11
evade 0 18 11
detection, 0 18 11
he 0 18 11
would 0 18 11
not 0 18 11
be 0 18 11
blabbing 0 18 11
details 0 18 11
about 0 18 11
it 0 18 11
to 0 18 11
his 0 18 11
neighbors. 0 18 11

However, 0 18 12
the 0 18 12
neighbor’s 0 18 12
claims 0 18 12
are 0 18 12
certain 0 18 12
to 0 18 12
attract 0 18 12
more 0 18 12
attention 0 18 12
given 0 18 12
that 0 18 12
no 0 18 12
specific 0 18 12
motive 0 18 12
has 0 18 12
yet 0 18 12
to 0 18 12
be 0 18 12
uncovered 0 18 12
for 0 18 12
the 0 18 12
shooting. 0 18 12

On 0 21 16

revealed 0 21 16
that 0 21 16
the 0 21 16

in 0 21 16
the 0 21 16

in 0 21 16
fact, 0 21 16
a 0 21 16

about 0 21 16

Minutes 0 21 17
that 0 21 17
finally 0 21 17
explain 0 21 17
what 0 21 17
was 0 21 17
written 0 21 17
on 0 21 17
the 0 21 17
mysterious 0 21 17
note. 0 21 17

“I 0 21 18
could 0 21 18
see 0 21 18
on 0 21 18
it 0 21 18
he 0 21 18
had 0 21 18
written 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
distance, 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
elevation 0 21 18
he 0 21 18
was 0 21 18
on, 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
drop 0 21 18
of 0 21 18
what 0 21 18
his 0 21 18
bullet 0 21 18
was 0 21 18
gonna 0 21 18
be 0 21 18
for 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
crowd,” 0 21 18
said 0 21 18

Dave 0 21 18

from 0 21 18

preview 0 21 18
clip 0 21 18
of 0 21 18
Sunday’s 0 21 18
report. 0 21 18

“So 0 21 19
he 0 21 19
had 0 21 19
that 0 21 19
written 0 21 19
down 0 21 19
and 0 21 19
figured 0 21 19
out 0 21 19
so 0 21 19
he 0 21 19
would 0 21 19
know 0 21 19
where 0 21 19
to 0 21 19

to 0 21 19
hit 0 21 19
his 0 21 19
targets 0 21 19
from 0 21 19
there.” 0 21 19

Paddock’s 0 21 20
note 0 21 20
was 0 21 20
clearly 0 21 20
not 0 21 20
a 0 21 20
suicide 0 21 20
letter. 0 21 20

Rather, 0 21 21
it 0 21 21
detailed 0 21 21
bullet 0 21 21
trajectory 0 21 21
and 0 21 21
included 0 21 21
calculations 0 21 21
about 0 21 21
where 0 21 21
he 0 21 21
needed 0 21 21
to 0 21 21
aim 0 21 21
his 0 21 21
weapons 0 21 21
to 0 21 21
maximize 0 21 21
accuracy 0 21 21
and 0 21 21
optimize 0 21 21
his 0 21 21
kill 0 21 21
rate. 0 21 21

Investigators 0 21 22
have 0 21 22

looking 0 21 22
for 0 21 22

the 0 21 23

While 1 21 24

not 1 21 24
reveal 1 21 24
the 1 21 24

they 1 21 24

tell 1 21 24
reporters 1 21 24
she 1 21 24
was 1 21 24
a 1 21 24

Police 0 21 25
are 0 21 25
still 0 21 25
investigating 0 21 25
whether 0 21 25
or 0 21 25
not 0 21 25
Paddock 0 21 25
acted 0 21 25
alone. 0 21 25

They 0 21 26
believe 0 21 26
he 0 21 26
may 0 21 26
have 0 21 26
had 0 21 26
an 0 21 26

such 0 21 26
a 0 21 26

the 0 21 26
fact 0 21 26
that 0 21 26
some 0 21 26

purchased 1 21 26
under 1 21 26
someone 1 21 26

As 0 21 27

“Meantime, 0 21 28

also 0 21 30
believe 0 21 30

sponsored 0 22 3
talks 0 22 3
by 0 22 3
an 0 22 3
anti-Semite 0 22 3
who 0 22 3
accused 1 22 3

The 0 22 4
fruits 0 22 4
of 0 22 4
the 0 22 4
AJHS 0 22 4
and 0 22 4
JVP 0 22 4
partnership 0 22 4
have 0 22 4
been 0 22 4
a 0 22 4
series 0 22 4
of 0 22 4
events 0 22 4
attacking 0 22 4
Israel. 0 22 4

Coming 0 22 5
up 0 22 5
in 0 22 5
late 0 22 5
October 0 22 5
is 0 22 5
“The 0 22 5
Balfour 0 22 5
Declaration: 0 22 5
Support 0 22 5
for 0 22 5
a 0 22 5
Jewish 0 22 5

or 0 22 5
Jewish 0 22 5
State?” 0 22 5

The 0 22 6
two 0 22 6
speakers 0 22 6
are 0 22 6
Robert 0 22 6
Herbst, 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
coordinator 0 22 6
of 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
Westchester 0 22 6
chapter 0 22 6
of 0 22 6
JVP, 0 22 6
and 0 22 6
Jonathan 0 22 6
Kuttab, 0 22 6
who 0 22 6
advocates 0 22 6
a 0 22 6
one-state 0 22 6
solution 0 22 6
for 0 22 6
eliminating 0 22 6
Israel. 0 22 6

He 0 22 7
had 0 22 7
tweeted, 0 22 7
"EU 1 22 7
no 1 22 7
longer 1 22 7
considers 1 22 7
#Hamas 1 22 7
a 1 22 7
terrorist 1 22 7
group. 1 22 7

Time 1 22 8
for 1 22 8
US 1 22 8
to 1 22 8
do 1 22 8
same." 1 22 8

Kuttab 0 22 9
has 0 22 9
defended 0 22 9
Islamic 0 22 9
anti-Semitism 0 22 9
by 0 22 9
claiming 0 22 9
that 0 22 9
the 0 22 9
“distrust 0 22 9
Moslems 0 22 9
feel 0 22 9
towards 0 22 9
Jews” 0 22 9
is 0 22 9
due 0 22 9
to 0 22 9
“two 0 22 9
acts 0 22 9
of 0 22 9
betrayal 0 22 9
by 0 22 9
Jewish 0 22 9
tribes 0 22 9
against 0 22 9
the 0 22 9
Prophet.” 0 22 9
And 0 22 9
that 0 22 9
Jews 0 22 9
suffer 0 22 9
from 0 22 9
a 0 22 9
“Holocaust 1 22 9
Syndrome” 1 22 9
of 1 22 9
entitlement. 1 22 9

He 0 22 10
justified 0 22 10
hijacking 0 22 10
planes, 0 22 10
described 0 22 10
suicide 0 22 10
bombers 0 22 10
as 0 22 10
“taking 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
supreme 0 22 10
sacrifice” 0 22 10
and 0 22 10
defended 0 22 10
Hezbollah 1 22 10
as 1 22 10
“an 1 22 10
armed-resistance 1 22 10
movement” 1 22 10

He 0 22 11
has 0 22 11
claimed 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
"Jewish 0 22 11
community 0 22 11
gradually 0 22 11
consolidated 0 22 11
its 0 22 11
power, 0 22 11
wealth, 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
influence 0 22 11
in 0 22 11
all 0 22 11
sectors 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
society" 0 22 11
especially 0 22 11
in 0 22 11
"crucial 0 22 11
sectors 0 22 11
like 0 22 11
banking, 0 22 11
finance, 0 22 11
media” 0 22 11
where 0 22 11
"their 0 22 11
influence 0 22 11
both 0 22 11
as 0 22 11
individuals 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
an 0 22 11
organized 0 22 11
community 0 22 11
far 0 22 11
exceeded 0 22 11
their 0 22 11
numbers" 0 22 11
and 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
their 0 22 11
power 0 22 11
strengthens 0 22 11
“conspiracy 0 22 11
theories 0 22 11
about 0 22 11
‘Jewish 0 22 11
control’ 0 22 11
that 0 22 11
are 0 22 11
reminiscent 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
infamous 0 22 11
“’Protocols 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
the 0 22 11
Elders 0 22 11
of 0 22 11
Zion.’” 0 22 11

Robert 0 22 12
Herbst 0 22 12
and 0 22 12
Jonathan 0 22 12
Kuttab 0 22 12
are 0 22 12
both 0 22 12
supporters 0 22 12
of 0 22 12
a 0 22 12
one-state 0 22 12
plan 0 22 12
for 0 22 12
eliminating 0 22 12
Israel. 0 22 12

The 0 22 13
American 0 22 13
Jewish 0 22 13
Historical 0 22 13
Society 0 22 13
is 0 22 13
co-sponsoring 0 22 13
a 0 22 13

event 0 22 13
by 0 22 13
two 0 22 13
opponents 0 22 13
of 0 22 13
Israel, 0 22 13
one 0 22 13
of 0 22 13
whom 0 22 13
has 0 22 13
defended 0 22 13
Hamas. 0 22 13

An 0 22 14
organization 0 22 14
that 0 22 14
hands 0 22 14
out 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
Emma 0 22 14
Lazarus 0 22 14
Award, 0 22 14
named 0 22 14
after 0 22 14
a 0 22 14
passionate 0 22 14
Zionist, 0 22 14
at 0 22 14
its 0 22 14
posh 0 22 14
dinners 0 22 14
is 0 22 14
hosting 0 22 14
attacks 0 22 14
on 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
existence 0 22 14
of 0 22 14
Israel. 0 22 14

The 0 22 15
“Jewish 0 22 15
Homeland” 0 22 15
or 0 22 15
“Jewish 0 22 15
State” 0 22 15
argument 0 22 15
is 0 22 15
a 0 22 15
hook 0 22 15
for 0 22 15
contending 0 22 15
that 0 22 15
the 0 22 15
Balfour 0 22 15
Declaration 0 22 15
didn’t 0 22 15
endorse 0 22 15
Israel, 0 22 15
but 0 22 15
some 0 22 15
sort 0 22 15
of 0 22 15
Jewish 0 22 15
Bantustan 0 22 15
within 0 22 15
a 0 22 15
Muslim 0 22 15
country. 0 22 15

That 0 22 16
worked 0 22 16
so 0 22 16
well 0 22 16
for 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
Christians 0 22 16
and 0 22 16
Jews 0 22 16
of 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
Middle 0 22 16
East. 0 22 16

The 0 22 17
American 0 22 17
Jewish 0 22 17
Historical 0 22 17
Society 0 22 17
is 0 22 17
not 0 22 17
only 0 22 17
co-sponsoring 0 22 17
a 0 22 17

by 0 22 17
an 0 22 17
anti-Israel 0 22 17
hate 0 22 17
group. 0 22 17

But 0 22 18
it’s 0 22 18
also 0 22 18
hosting 0 22 18
it 0 22 18
at 0 22 18
the 0 22 18
Center 0 22 18
for 0 22 18
Jewish 0 22 18
History’s 0 22 18
headquarters. 0 22 18

AJHS 0 22 19
is 0 22 19
a 0 22 19
component 0 22 19
of 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
Center 0 22 19
for 0 22 19
Jewish 0 22 19
History. 0 22 19

And 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
partnership 0 22 20
between 0 22 20
AJHS 0 22 20
and 0 22 20
JVP 0 22 20
sheds 0 22 20
light 0 22 20
on 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
controversy 0 22 20
over 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
appointment 0 22 20
of 0 22 20
David 0 22 20
N. 0 22 20
Myers, 0 22 20
an 0 22 20
anti-Israel 0 22 20
activist, 0 22 20
to 0 22 20
head 0 22 20
the 0 22 20
Center 0 22 20
for 0 22 20
Jewish 0 22 20
History. 0 22 20

During 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Myers 0 22 21
controversy, 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Center 0 22 21
took 0 22 21
pains 0 22 21
to 0 22 21
disassociate 0 22 21
Myers 0 22 21
and 0 22 21
themselves 0 22 21
from 0 22 21
JVP 0 22 21
because 0 22 21
a 0 22 21
JVP 0 22 21
handout 0 22 21
had 0 22 21
listed 0 22 21
him 0 22 21
as 0 22 21
a 0 22 21
“JVP 0 22 21
Academic 0 22 21
Advisory 0 22 21
Board 0 22 21
Member.” 0 22 21
But 0 22 21
in 0 22 21
reality 0 22 21
the 0 22 21
Center, 0 22 21
through 0 22 21
AJHS, 0 22 21
has 0 22 21
an 0 22 21
ongoing 0 22 21
relationship 0 22 21
with 0 22 21
JVP. 0 22 21

The 0 22 22
Balfour 0 22 22
event 0 22 22
was 0 22 22
not 0 22 22
AJHS’ 0 22 22
only 0 22 22
partnership 0 22 22
with 0 22 22
JVP. 0 22 22

In 0 22 23
December, 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
AJHS 0 22 23
will 0 22 23
feature 0 22 23
“Rubble 0 22 23
Rubble”, 0 22 23
a 0 22 23
play 0 22 23
by 0 22 23
Dan 0 22 23
Fishback 0 22 23
based 0 22 23
on 0 22 23
his 0 22 23
trip 0 22 23
to 0 22 23
Israel. 0 22 23

Fishback 0 22 24
is 0 22 24
a 0 22 24
BDS 0 22 24
supporter 0 22 24
and 0 22 24
a 0 22 24
member 0 22 24
of 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
JVP 0 22 24
Artists 0 22 24
Council. 0 22 24

His 0 22 25
goal 0 22 25
is 0 22 25
to 0 22 25
“normalize 0 22 25
Jewish 0 22 25
anti-Zionism”. 0 22 25

AJHS 0 22 26
and 0 22 26
JVP 0 22 26
members 0 22 26
get 0 22 26
discounted 0 22 26
admission. 0 22 26

The 0 22 27
venue 0 22 27
is 0 22 27
once 0 22 27
again 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Center 0 22 27
for 0 22 27
Jewish 0 22 27
History. 0 22 27

Specifically 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
Leo 0 22 28
and 0 22 28
Julia 0 22 28
Forchheimer 0 22 28
Auditorium 0 22 28
at 0 22 28
CJH. 0 22 28

Leo 0 22 29
Forchheimer’s 0 22 29
philanthropy 0 22 29
had 0 22 29
left 0 22 29
its 0 22 29
mark 0 22 29
on 0 22 29
Israel. 0 22 29

What 0 22 30
would 0 22 30
he 0 22 30
think 0 22 30
if 0 22 30
he 0 22 30
knew 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
anti-Israel 0 22 30
purposes 0 22 30
that 0 22 30
CJH 0 22 30
is 0 22 30
putting 0 22 30
his 0 22 30
gift 0 22 30
to? 0 22 30

A 0 22 31
third 0 22 31
AJHS-JVP 0 22 31
event 0 22 31
featured 0 22 31
Efrat 0 22 31
Yerday, 0 22 31
an 1 22 31
anti-Israel 1 22 31
activist, 0 22 31
accusing 0 22 31
Israel 0 22 31
of 0 22 31
racism. 0 22 31

Efrat 0 22 32
has 0 22 32
claimed 0 22 32
that, 0 22 32
"Zionism 1 22 32
does 1 22 32
not 1 22 32
only 1 22 32
dispossess 1 22 32
Palestinians, 1 22 32
but 1 22 32
it 1 22 32
also 1 22 32
dispossesses 1 22 32
in 1 22 32
a 1 22 32
very 1 22 32
sophisticated 1 22 32
way, 1 22 32
non-white 1 22 32
Jews. 1 22 32

Being 1 22 33
Jewish 1 22 33
is 1 22 33
highly 1 22 33
identified 1 22 33
with 1 22 33
being 1 22 33
white 1 22 33
because 1 22 33
of 1 22 33
Zionism." 1 22 33

AJHS 0 22 34
will 0 22 34
claim 0 22 34
that 0 22 34
it 0 22 34
is 0 22 34
only 0 22 34
offering 0 22 34
different 0 22 34
perspectives. 0 22 34

But 0 22 35
when 0 22 35
it 0 22 35
comes 0 22 35
to 0 22 35
Israel, 0 22 35
there’s 0 22 35
only 0 22 35
one 0 22 35
perspective. 0 22 35

“Balfour” 0 22 36
and 0 22 36
“Rubble 0 22 36
Rubble” 0 22 36
are 0 22 36
to 0 22 36
be 0 22 36
part 0 22 36
of 0 22 36
AJHS’ 0 22 36
“1917: 0 22 36
How 0 22 36
One 0 22 36
Year 0 22 36
Changed 0 22 36
the 0 22 36
World”. 0 22 36

The 0 22 37
exhibition 0 22 37
is 0 22 37
supposed 0 22 37
to 0 22 37
cover 0 22 37
WWI, 0 22 37
the 0 22 37
Bolshevik 0 22 37
Revolution, 0 22 37
and 0 22 37
the 0 22 37
Balfour 0 22 37
Declaration. 0 22 37

But 0 22 38
the 0 22 38
only 0 22 38
Balfour 0 22 38
program 0 22 38
on 0 22 38
the 0 22 38
list 0 22 38
questions 0 22 38
whether 0 22 38
Israel 0 22 38
should 0 22 38
even 0 22 38
exist. 0 22 38

The 0 22 39
exhibition 0 22 39
closes 0 22 39
with 0 22 39
Fishback’s 0 22 39
anti-Israel 0 22 39
agenda. 0 22 39

And 0 22 40
these 0 22 40
are 0 22 40
the 0 22 40
only 0 22 40
listed 0 22 40
AJHS 0 22 40
programs 0 22 40
that 0 22 40
focus 0 22 40
on 0 22 40
Israel. 0 22 40

JVP 0 22 41
is 0 22 41
also 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
only 0 22 41
organization 0 22 41
that 0 22 41
AJHS 0 22 41
chooses 0 22 41
to 0 22 41
partner 0 22 41
with 0 22 41
on 0 22 41
political 0 22 41
events. 0 22 41

The 0 22 42
American 0 22 42
Jewish 0 22 42
Historical 0 22 42
Society 0 22 42
appears 0 22 42
to 0 22 42
be 0 22 42
uninterested 0 22 42
in 0 22 42
holding 0 22 42
any 0 22 42
pro-Israel 0 22 42

It’s 0 22 43
uninterested 0 22 43
in 0 22 43
partnering 0 22 43
with 0 22 43
pro-Israel 0 22 43
groups. 0 22 43

Instead 0 22 44
it’s 0 22 44
providing 0 22 44
a 0 22 44
forum 0 22 44
for 0 22 44
a 0 22 44

group. 0 22 44

And 0 22 45
it’s 0 22 45
no 0 22 45
mystery 0 22 45
why. 0 22 45

The 0 22 46
AJHS 0 22 46

Council 0 22 46
is 0 22 46

When 0 22 52
we 0 22 52
look 0 22 52
at 0 22 52
what 0 22 52
is 0 22 52
going 0 22 52
on 0 22 52
in 0 22 52
CJH’s 0 22 52
components 0 22 52
like 0 22 52
the 0 22 52

the 0 22 52
elevation 0 22 52
of 0 22 52

N. 0 22 52
Myers 0 22 52
to 0 22 52
head 0 22 52
CJH 0 22 52
is 0 22 52
unsurprising. 0 22 52

Myers 0 22 53
is 0 22 53
a 0 22 53
symptom 0 22 53
of 0 22 53
the 0 22 53
problem. 0 22 53

As 0 22 54
is 0 22 54
AJHS’s 0 22 54
partnership 0 22 54
with 0 22 54
JVP. 0 22 54

A 0 22 55
great 0 22 55
deal 0 22 55
of 0 22 55
shocking 0 22 55
behavior 0 22 55
is 0 22 55
taking 0 22 55
place 0 22 55
inside 0 22 55
Jewish 0 22 55
organizations 0 22 55
whose 0 22 55
inner 0 22 55
workings 0 22 55
most 0 22 55
people 0 22 55
in 0 22 55
the 0 22 55
Jewish 0 22 55
community 0 22 55
generally 0 22 55
pay 0 22 55
very 0 22 55
little 0 22 55
attention 0 22 55
to. 0 22 55

Unlike 0 22 56
CJH, 0 22 56
the 0 22 56
American 0 22 56
Jewish 0 22 56
Historical 0 22 56
Society 0 22 56
is 0 22 56
an 0 22 56
organization 0 22 56
that 0 22 56
dates 0 22 56
back 0 22 56
to 0 22 56
the 0 22 56
19th 0 22 56
century. 0 22 56

Its 1 22 57
perversion 1 22 57
by 0 22 57
the 0 22 57
radical 0 22 57
anti-Jewish 0 22 57
and 0 22 57
anti-Israel 0 22 57
left 0 22 57
to 0 22 57
serve 0 22 57
anti-Semitic 0 22 57
narratives 0 22 57
is 0 22 57
tragic. 0 22 57

And 0 22 58
yet 0 22 58
it’s 0 22 58
inescapable. 0 22 58

Even 0 22 59
as 0 22 59
the 0 22 59
Myers 0 22 59
scandal 0 22 59
continues 0 22 59
to 0 22 59
simmer, 1 22 59
the 0 22 59
AJHS 0 22 59
partnership 0 22 59
with 0 22 59
JVP 0 22 59
is 0 22 59
making 0 22 59
the 0 22 59
choice 0 22 59
painfully 0 22 59
clear. 0 22 59

The 0 22 60
radical 0 22 60
anti-Israel 0 22 60
left 0 22 60
will 0 22 60
not 0 22 60
be 0 22 60
satisfied 0 22 60
with 0 22 60
embedding 0 22 60
“moderate” 0 22 60
opposing 0 22 60
voices 0 22 60
into 0 22 60
Jewish 0 22 60
organizations. 0 22 60

Instead 0 22 61
it 0 22 61
seeks 0 22 61
to 0 22 61
normalize 0 22 61
the 0 22 61
furthest 0 22 61
extremes 0 22 61
of 0 22 61
anti-Israel 0 22 61
hatred. 0 22 61

And 0 22 62
it 0 22 62
will 0 22 62
not 0 22 62
be 0 22 62
satisfied 0 22 62
with 0 22 62
anything 0 22 62
less. 0 22 62

During 0 22 63
the 0 22 63
Myers 0 22 63
controversy, 0 22 63
defenders 0 22 63
of 0 22 63
his 0 22 63
appointment, 0 22 63
including 0 22 63
some 0 22 63
figures 0 22 63
named 0 22 63
here, 0 22 63
claimed 0 22 63
that 0 22 63
it 0 22 63
was 0 22 63
an 0 22 63
issue 0 22 63
of 0 22 63
apolitical 0 22 63
scholarship. 0 22 63

Is 0 22 64
co-sponsoring 0 22 64
events 0 22 64
with 0 22 64
a 0 22 64
hate 0 22 64
group 0 22 64
that 0 22 64
has 0 22 64
sponsored 0 22 64
talks 0 22 64
by 0 22 64
a 0 22 64
woman 0 22 64
who 0 22 64
accused 1 22 64
Jews 1 22 64
of 1 22 64
drinking 1 22 64
blood 1 22 64
also 0 22 64
apolitical 0 22 64
scholarship? 0 22 64

The 0 22 65
anti-Israel 0 22 65
leftists 0 22 65
at 0 22 65
the 0 22 65
AJHS 0 22 65
are 0 22 65
clearly 0 22 65
not 0 22 65
leaving 0 22 65
their 0 22 65
politics 0 22 65
at 0 22 65
home. 0 22 65

And 0 22 66
support 0 22 66
for 0 22 66
them 0 22 66
and 0 22 66
for 0 22 66
Myers 0 22 66
cannot 0 22 66
be 0 22 66
distinguished 0 22 66
from 0 22 66
support 0 22 66
for 0 22 66
their 0 22 66
views. 0 22 66

Not 0 22 67
when 0 22 67
JVP 0 22 67
is 0 22 67
at 0 22 67
AJHS. 0 22 67

We 1 22 68
all 1 22 68
have 1 22 68
choices 1 22 68
to 1 22 68
make. 1 22 68

Sometimes 0 22 69
the 0 22 69
choices 0 22 69
are 0 22 69
murky. 0 22 69

Other 0 22 70
times 0 22 70
they 0 22 70
are 0 22 70
simple 0 22 70
and 0 22 70
easy. 0 22 70

When 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
American 0 22 71
Jewish 0 22 71
Historical 0 22 71
Society 0 22 71
hosts 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
co-sponsors 0 22 71
an 0 22 71
event 0 22 71
by 0 22 71
a 0 22 71
BDS 0 22 71
hate 0 22 71
group 0 22 71
attacking 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
existence 0 22 71
of 0 22 71
Israel 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
featuring 0 22 71
a 0 22 71
speaker 0 22 71
who 0 22 71
had 0 22 71
defended 0 22 71
terrorism 0 22 71
and 0 22 71
anti-Semitism, 0 22 71
the 0 22 71
choice 0 22 71
becomes 0 22 71
easy. 0 22 71

Either 1 22 72
you 1 22 72
stand 1 22 72
with 1 22 72
BDS, 1 22 72
Hamas, 1 22 72
blood 1 22 72
libels 1 22 72
and 1 22 72
those 1 22 72
who 1 22 72
want 1 22 72
to 1 22 72
destroy 1 22 72
Israel 1 22 72
or 1 22 72
with 1 22 72
Jews. 1 22 72

As 0 22 73
the 0 22 73
anti-Israel 0 22 73
radicalism 0 22 73
of 0 22 73
the 0 22 73
left 0 22 73
grows, 0 22 73
such 0 22 73
choices 0 22 73
will 0 22 73
become 0 22 73
even 0 22 73
more 0 22 73
obscenely 0 22 73
simple. 0 22 73

But 0 22 74
they 0 22 74
will 0 22 74
not 0 22 74
be 0 22 74
any 0 22 74
less 0 22 74
difficult. 0 22 74

Opposing 0 22 75
the 0 22 75
anti-Israel 0 22 75
left 0 22 75
makes 0 22 75
many 0 22 75
important 0 22 75
enemies 0 22 75
and 0 22 75
wins 0 22 75
few 0 22 75
friends. 0 22 75

The 0 22 76
anti-Israel 0 22 76
left 0 22 76
has 0 22 76
built 0 22 76
networks 0 22 76
that 0 22 76
can 0 22 76
blacklist, 0 22 76
smear 0 22 76
and 0 22 76
silence 0 22 76
almost 0 22 76
anyone 0 22 76
in 0 22 76
an 0 22 76
academic 0 22 76
field. 0 22 76

Speaking 0 22 77
out 0 22 77
against 0 22 77
hate 0 22 77
is 0 22 77
easiest 0 22 77
when 0 22 77
it’s 0 22 77
weakest. 0 22 77

It’s 0 22 78
hardest 0 22 78
when 0 22 78
it’s 0 22 78
strongest. 0 22 78

When 0 22 79
we 0 22 79
think 0 22 79
about 0 22 79
Nazi 0 22 79
Germany, 0 22 79
we 0 22 79
remember 0 22 79
those 0 22 79
who 0 22 79
spoke 0 22 79
out. 0 22 79

We 0 22 80
don’t 0 22 80
remember 0 22 80
those 0 22 80
who 0 22 80
were 0 22 80
too 0 22 80
intimidated 0 22 80
and 0 22 80
uncertain 0 22 80
to 0 22 80
rise 0 22 80
against 0 22 80
anti-Semitism 0 22 80
when 0 22 80
they 0 22 80
saw 0 22 80
it 0 22 80
and 0 22 80
heard 0 22 80
it. 0 22 80

History 0 22 81
tells 0 22 81
us 0 22 81
why 0 22 81
so 0 22 81
many 0 22 81
people 0 22 81
are 0 22 81
afraid 0 22 81
to 0 22 81
do 0 22 81
the 0 22 81
right 0 22 81
thing 0 22 81
when 0 22 81
it 0 22 81
counts. 0 22 81

It 0 22 82
also 0 22 82
tells 0 22 82
us 0 22 82
how 0 22 82
irrelevant 0 22 82
history 0 22 82
makes 0 22 82
them. 0 22 82

before 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
close 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
Vatican 0 23 6
II 0 23 6
and 0 23 6
just 0 23 6
as 0 23 6
Annibale 0 23 6
Bugnini 0 23 6
was 0 23 6
cranking 0 23 6
open 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
floodgates 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
his 0 23 6
never-ending 0 23 6
stream 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
liturgical 0 23 6
alterations, 0 23 6
Mysterium 0 23 6
Fidei 0 23 6
is 0 23 6
now 0 23 6
an 0 23 6
important 0 23 6
marker 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
a 0 23 6
critical 0 23 6
turning 0 23 6
point 0 23 6
in 0 23 6
Catholic 0 23 6
history, 0 23 6
perhaps 0 23 6
the 0 23 6
most 0 23 6
important 0 23 6
of 0 23 6
modern 0 23 6
times. 0 23 6

Who 1 23 7
can 1 23 7
read 1 23 7
this 1 23 7
without 1 23 7
cringing 1 23 7
at 1 23 7
what 1 23 7
we 1 23 7
now 1 23 7
know 1 23 7
was 1 23 7
about 1 23 7
to 1 23 7
happen: 1 23 7

Therefore, 0 23 8
we 0 23 8
earnestly 0 23 8
hope 0 23 8
that 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
restored 0 23 8
sacred 0 23 8
liturgy 0 23 8
will 0 23 8
bring 0 23 8
forth 0 23 8
abundant 0 23 8
fruits 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
eucharistic 0 23 8
devotion, 0 23 8
so 0 23 8
that 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
Holy 0 23 8
Church, 0 23 8
under 0 23 8
this 0 23 8
saving 0 23 8
sign 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
piety, 0 23 8
may 0 23 8
make 0 23 8
daily 0 23 8
progress 0 23 8
toward 0 23 8
perfect 0 23 8
unity 0 23 8
and 0 23 8
may 0 23 8
invite 0 23 8
all 0 23 8
Christians 0 23 8
to 0 23 8
a 0 23 8
unity 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
faith 0 23 8
and 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
love, 0 23 8
drawing 0 23 8
them 0 23 8
gently, 0 23 8
thanks 0 23 8
to 0 23 8
the 0 23 8
action 0 23 8
of 0 23 8
divine 0 23 8
grace. 0 23 8

But 0 23 9
in 0 23 9
1983 0 23 9
at 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
start 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
my 0 23 9
personal 0 23 9
investigations 0 23 9
into 0 23 9
the 0 23 9
Catholic 0 23 9
religion, 0 23 9
I 0 23 9
knew 0 23 9
nothing 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
any 0 23 9
of 0 23 9
that. 0 23 9

The 0 23 10
encyclical, 0 23 10
the 0 23 10
very 0 23 10
first 0 23 10
I 0 23 10
ever 0 23 10
read, 0 23 10
was 0 23 10
also 0 23 10
a 0 23 10
marker 0 23 10
for 0 23 10
me 0 23 10
of 0 23 10
a 0 23 10
personal 0 23 10
turning 0 23 10
point. 0 23 10

It 0 23 11
was 0 23 11
the 0 23 11
first 0 23 11
time 0 23 11
I 0 23 11
had 0 23 11
ever 0 23 11
seen 0 23 11
Catholic 0 23 11
eucharistic 0 23 11
doctrine 0 23 11
clearly 0 23 11
and 0 23 11
– 0 23 11
most 0 23 11
importantly 0 23 11
– 0 23 11
unapologetically 0 23 11
stated. 0 23 11

It 0 23 12
came 0 23 12
right 0 23 12
out 0 23 12
and 0 23 12
said 0 23 12
something 0 23 12
so 0 23 12
astounding, 0 23 12
something 0 23 12
so 0 23 12
completely 0 23 12
unlikely, 0 23 12
that 0 23 12
I 0 23 12
had 0 23 12
to 0 23 12
admit 0 23 12
that 0 23 12
it 0 23 12
left 0 23 12
very 0 23 12
few 0 23 12
logical 0 23 12
possibilities. 0 23 12

Like 0 23 13
C.S. 0 23 13

Lewis’s 0 23 14
assessment 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
claims 0 23 14
by 0 23 14
Christ 0 23 14
of 0 23 14
His 0 23 14
own 0 23 14
divinity, 0 23 14
this 0 23 14
pope 0 23 14
was 0 23 14
either 0 23 14
mad, 0 23 14
bad 0 23 14
or 0 23 14
telling 0 23 14
the 0 23 14
plain 0 23 14
truth. 0 23 14

Something 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
may 0 23 15
be 0 23 15
much 0 23 15
more 0 23 15
noteworthy 0 23 15
now 0 23 15
in 0 23 15
our 0 23 15
current 0 23 15
circumstances 0 23 15
than 0 23 15
it 0 23 15
was 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
year 0 23 15
I 0 23 15
read 0 23 15
it, 0 23 15
is 0 23 15
that 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
pope’s 0 23 15
very 0 23 15
first 0 23 15
quote 0 23 15
was 0 23 15
not 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
scripture, 0 23 15
but 0 23 15
the 0 23 15
Council 0 23 15
of 0 23 15
Trent: 0 23 15

“At 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Last 0 23 16
Supper, 0 23 16
on 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
night 0 23 16
He 0 23 16
was 0 23 16
handed 0 23 16
over, 0 23 16
Our 0 23 16
Lord 0 23 16
instituted 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Eucharistic 0 23 16
Sacrifice 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
Body 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
Blood, 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
perpetuate 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
sacrifice 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
cross 0 23 16
throughout 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
ages 0 23 16
until 0 23 16
He 0 23 16
should 0 23 16
come, 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
thus 0 23 16
entrust 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
Church, 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
beloved 0 23 16
spouse, 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
memorial 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
His 0 23 16
death 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
resurrection: 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
sacrament 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
devotion, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
sign 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
unity, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
bond 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
charity, 0 23 16
a 0 23 16
paschal 0 23 16
banquet 0 23 16
in 0 23 16
which 0 23 16
Christ 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
received, 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
soul 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
filled 0 23 16
with 0 23 16
grace 0 23 16
and 0 23 16
there 0 23 16
is 0 23 16
given 0 23 16
to 0 23 16
us 0 23 16
the 0 23 16
pledge 0 23 16
of 0 23 16
future 0 23 16
glory.” 0 23 16

In 0 23 17
these 0 23 17
words 0 23 17
are 0 23 17
highlighted 0 23 17
both 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
sacrifice, 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
pertains 0 23 17
to 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
essence 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Mass 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
is 0 23 17
celebrated 0 23 17
daily, 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
sacrament 0 23 17
in 0 23 17
which 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
faithful 0 23 17
participate 0 23 17
in 0 23 17
Holy 0 23 17
Communion 0 23 17
by 0 23 17
eating 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
Flesh 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
Christ 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
drinking 0 23 17
His 0 23 17
Blood, 0 23 17
receiving 0 23 17
both 0 23 17
grace, 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
beginning 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
eternal 0 23 17
life, 0 23 17
and 0 23 17
the 0 23 17
medicine 0 23 17
of 0 23 17
immortality. 0 23 17

I 0 23 18
remember 0 23 18
my 0 23 18
thoughts 0 23 18
upon 0 23 18
reading 0 23 18
this 0 23 18
shocking 0 23 18
statement… 0 23 18
“By 0 23 18
doing 0 23 18
what? 0 23 18

!” 0 23 19

My 0 23 20
acceptance 0 23 20
from 0 23 20
the 0 23 20
reading 0 23 20
of 0 23 20
this 0 23 20
document 0 23 20
of 0 23 20
the 0 23 20
Church’s 0 23 20
orthodox 0 23 20
eucharistic 0 23 20
doctrine 0 23 20
was 0 23 20
based 0 23 20
in 0 23 20
part 0 23 20
on 0 23 20
Pope 1 23 20
Paul’s 1 23 20
gracious 1 23 20
and 1 23 20
beautiful 1 23 20
exposition, 1 23 20
and 1 23 20
in 1 23 20
part 1 23 20
on 1 23 20
the 1 23 20
sheer 1 23 20
radical, 1 23 20
mad 1 23 20
unlikeliness 1 23 20
of 1 23 20

it. 1 23 21
What 0 23 21
could 0 23 21
conceivably 0 23 21
be 0 23 21
the 0 23 21
reason 0 23 21
to 0 23 21
say 0 23 21
anything 0 23 21
as 0 23 21
wild 0 23 21
as 0 23 21
this 0 23 21
if 0 23 21
it 0 23 21
weren’t 0 23 21
true? 0 23 21

The 1 23 22
idea 1 23 22
of 1 23 22
transubstantiation 1 23 22
struck 1 23 22
me 1 23 22
as 1 23 22
I 1 23 22
read 1 23 22
that 1 23 22
document 1 23 22
as 1 23 22
possibly 1 23 22
the 1 23 22
strangest 1 23 22
and 1 23 22
most 1 23 22
earth 1 23 22
shattering 1 23 22
thing 1 23 22
I’d 1 23 22
ever 1 23 22
heard. 1 23 22

It 1 23 23
shocked 1 23 23
me 1 23 23
out 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
a 1 23 23
kind 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
swamp 1 23 23
of 1 23 23
intellectual 1 23 23
worldliness; 1 23 23
presenting 1 23 23
the 1 23 23
idea 1 23 23
to 1 23 23
my 1 23 23
thirsty 1 23 23
mind 1 23 23
that 1 23 23
there 1 23 23
could 1 23 23
indeed 1 23 23
be 1 23 23
fantastic 1 23 23
realities 1 23 23
far 1 23 23
more 1 23 23
wonderful 1 23 23
than 1 23 23
the 1 23 23
banal 1 23 23
and 1 23 23
painfully 1 23 23
uninteresting 1 23 23
secularist 1 23 23
worldview 1 23 23
I 1 23 23
had 1 23 23
been 1 23 23
taught 1 23 23
to 1 23 23
accept. 1 23 23

It 1 23 24
was 1 23 24
as 1 23 24
though 1 23 24
someone 1 23 24
had 1 23 24
plausibly 1 23 24
told 1 23 24
me 1 23 24
that, 1 23 24
yes, 1 23 24
there 1 23 24
were 1 23 24
fairies 1 23 24
and 1 23 24
magical 1 23 24
kingdoms 1 23 24
in 1 23 24
real 1 23 24
life, 1 23 24
“just 1 23 24
around 1 23 24
the 1 23 24
corner”. 1 23 24

By 0 23 25
the 0 23 25
time 0 23 25
I 0 23 25
read 0 23 25
it, 0 23 25
I 0 23 25
had 0 23 25
been 0 23 25
through 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
long, 0 23 25
slow 0 23 25
transition 0 23 25
from 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
childhood 0 23 25
devoted 0 23 25
to 0 23 25
Our 0 23 25
Lady 0 23 25
and 0 23 25
confirmed 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
my 0 23 25
belief 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
wonders, 0 23 25
to 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
kind 0 23 25
of 0 23 25
disappointed 0 23 25
practical 0 23 25
atheism 0 23 25
after 0 23 25
three 0 23 25
years 0 23 25
in 0 23 25
a 0 23 25
diocesan 0 23 25
Catholic 0 23 25
parochial 0 23 25
school. 0 23 25

I 0 23 26
had 0 23 26
been 0 23 26
taught, 0 23 26
by 0 23 26
both 0 23 26
word 0 23 26
and 0 23 26
implication, 0 23 26
that 0 23 26
everything 0 23 26
the 0 23 26
Catholic 0 23 26
Church 0 23 26
had 0 23 26
taught 0 23 26
before 0 23 26
Vatican 0 23 26
II 0 23 26
was 0 23 26
pernicious 1 23 26
nonsense. 1 23 26

Where 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
simply 0 23 27
wrong 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
ridiculous 0 23 27
and 0 23 27
where 0 23 27
it 0 23 27
was 0 23 27
wrong 0 23 27
and 0 23 27
political 0 23 27
it 1 23 27
was 1 23 27
outright 1 23 27
wicked. 1 23 27

What 0 23 28
led 0 23 28
me 0 23 28
to 0 23 28
read 0 23 28
that 0 23 28
particular 0 23 28
encyclical 0 23 28
is 0 23 28
the 0 23 28
most 0 23 28
clearly 0 23 28
identifiable 0 23 28
moment 0 23 28
of 0 23 28
actual 0 23 28
grace 0 23 28
in 0 23 28
my 0 23 28
young 0 23 28
life 0 23 28
to 0 23 28
that 0 23 28

point. 0 23 29
It 0 23 29
was 0 23 29
the 0 23 29
first 0 23 29
time 0 23 29
it 0 23 29
occurred 0 23 29
to 0 23 29
me 0 23 29
to 0 23 29
investigate, 0 23 29
like 0 23 29
an 0 23 29
anthropologist, 0 23 29
what 0 23 29
the 0 23 29
Church 0 23 29
herself 0 23 29
said 0 23 29
about 0 23 29
her 0 23 29
teachings. 0 23 29

While 0 23 30
mulling 0 23 30
grimly 0 23 30
one 0 23 30
day 0 23 30
over 0 23 30
all 0 23 30
the 0 23 30
wickedness 0 23 30
of 0 23 30
the 0 23 30
Catholic 0 23 30
Church, 0 23 30
I 0 23 30
was 0 23 30
pulled 0 23 30
up 0 23 30
short 0 23 30
by 0 23 30
a 0 23 30
single 0 23 30
thought: 0 23 30
“I 0 23 30
could 0 23 30
be 0 23 30
wrong.” 0 23 30
At 0 23 30
17 0 23 30
it 0 23 30
seemed 0 23 30
such 0 23 30
an 0 23 30
unlikely 0 23 30
thing 0 23 30
to 0 23 30
think 0 23 30
I 0 23 30
was 0 23 30
rather 0 23 30
shocked. 0 23 30

But 0 23 31
stopping 0 23 31
a 0 23 31
moment 0 23 31
to 0 23 31
consider, 0 23 31
I 0 23 31
realised 0 23 31
that 0 23 31
I 0 23 31
had 0 23 31
only 0 23 31
ever 0 23 31
heard 0 23 31
about 0 23 31
Catholic 0 23 31
things 0 23 31
from 0 23 31
people 0 23 31
who 0 23 31
clearly 0 23 31
hated 0 23 31
the 0 23 31
Church; 0 23 31
her 0 23 31
enemies, 0 23 31
in 0 23 31

short. 0 23 32
It 0 23 32
hardly 0 23 32
seemed 0 23 32
just 0 23 32
to 0 23 32
convict 0 23 32
on 0 23 32
the 0 23 32
testimony 0 23 32
of 0 23 32
these 0 23 32
obviously 0 23 32
biased 0 23 32
witnesses. 0 23 32

In 0 23 33
order 0 23 33
to 0 23 33
properly 0 23 33
and 0 23 33
thoroughly 0 23 33
condemn 0 23 33
the 0 23 33
Church, 0 23 33
with 0 23 33
convincing 0 23 33
due 0 23 33
diligence, 0 23 33
I 0 23 33
had 0 23 33
to 0 23 33
read 0 23 33
something 0 23 33
about 0 23 33
it 0 23 33
that 0 23 33
didn’t 0 23 33
come 0 23 33
from 0 23 33
her 0 23 33
enemies. 0 23 33

The 0 23 34
same 0 23 34
day, 0 23 34
I 0 23 34
presented 0 23 34
myself 0 23 34
at 0 23 34
the 0 23 34
reference 0 23 34
desk 0 23 34
of 0 23 34
the 0 23 34
public 0 23 34
library 0 23 34
and 0 23 34
asked, 0 23 34
“Do 0 23 34
you 0 23 34
have 0 23 34
any 0 23 34
books 0 23 34
about 0 23 34
Catholicism? 0 23 34

Something 0 23 35
official?” 0 23 35
The 0 23 35
librarian 0 23 35
took 0 23 35
me 0 23 35
to 0 23 35
the 0 23 35
reference 0 23 35
section 0 23 35
and 0 23 35
showed 0 23 35
me 0 23 35
the 0 23 35
shelves 0 23 35
of 0 23 35
encyclicals, 0 23 35
documents 0 23 35
and 0 23 35
histories. 0 23 35

Saints 0 23 36
and 0 23 36
popes 0 23 36
from 0 23 36
one 0 23 36
end 0 23 36
of 0 23 36
the 0 23 36
stacks 0 23 36
to 0 23 36
the 0 23 36

other. 0 23 37
Having 0 23 37
no 0 23 37
clear 0 23 37
idea 0 23 37
what 0 23 37
my 0 23 37
own 0 23 37
question 0 23 37
meant, 0 23 37
I 0 23 37
just 0 23 37
picked 0 23 37
one 0 23 37
at 0 23 37

random. 0 23 38
The 0 23 38
description 0 23 38
of 0 23 38
the 0 23 38
Holy 0 23 38
Eucharist 0 23 38
as 0 23 38
the 0 23 38
supreme 0 23 38
Centre 0 23 38
from 0 23 38
which 0 23 38
all 0 23 38
our 0 23 38
life 0 23 38
as 0 23 38
Catholics 0 23 38
flow, 0 23 38
and 0 23 38
from 0 23 38
which 0 23 38
all 0 23 38
other 0 23 38
doctrines 0 23 38
radiated, 0 23 38
was 0 23 38
something 0 23 38
that 0 23 38
was 0 23 38
not 0 23 38
going 0 23 38
to 0 23 38
come 0 23 38
into 0 23 38
my 0 23 38
head 0 23 38
for 0 23 38
another 0 23 38
eight 0 23 38
years 0 23 38
of 0 23 38

reading. 0 23 39
But 0 23 39
even 0 23 39
so, 0 23 39
Mysterium 0 23 39
Fidei 0 23 39
forced 0 23 39
me 0 23 39
to 0 23 39
face 0 23 39
up 0 23 39
to 0 23 39
a 0 23 39
reality 0 23 39
I’d 0 23 39
never 0 23 39
dreamed 0 23 39
of 0 23 39
before; 0 23 39
that 0 23 39
this, 0 23 39
the 0 23 39
little 0 23 39
unassuming 0 23 39
wafer, 0 23 39
was 0 23 39
the 0 23 39
most 0 23 39
important 0 23 39
thing 0 23 39
in 0 23 39
the 0 23 39

world. 0 23 40
Reading 0 23 40
through 0 23 40
the 0 23 40
encyclical 0 23 40
again, 0 23 40
holding 0 23 40
it 0 23 40
up 0 23 40
next 0 23 40
to 0 23 40
the 0 23 40
current 0 23 40
situation 0 23 40
in 0 23 40
Rome, 0 23 40
makes 0 23 40
it 0 23 40
easier 0 23 40
to 0 23 40
clarify 0 23 40
certain 0 23 40
critical 0 23 40

issues. 0 23 41
Given 0 23 41
what 0 23 41
we 0 23 41
are 0 23 41
now 0 23 41
seeing, 0 23 41
consider 0 23 41
the 0 23 41
poignancy 0 23 41
of 0 23 41
the 0 23 41
following 0 23 41

passages: 0 23 42
When 0 23 42
dealing 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
restoration 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
sacred 0 23 42
liturgy, 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
Fathers 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
council, 0 23 42
by 0 23 42
reason 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
their 0 23 42
pastoral 0 23 42
concern 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
whole 0 23 42
Church, 0 23 42
considered 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
highest 0 23 42
importance 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
exhort 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
faithful 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
participate 0 23 42
actively 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
sound 0 23 42
faith 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
utmost 0 23 42
devotion 0 23 42
in 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
celebration 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
this 0 23 42
Most 0 23 42
Holy 0 23 42
Mystery, 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
offer 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
with 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
priest 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
God 0 23 42
as 0 23 42
a 0 23 42
sacrifice 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
their 0 23 42
own 0 23 42
salvation 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
for 0 23 42
that 0 23 42
of 0 23 42
the 0 23 42
whole 0 23 42
world, 0 23 42
and 0 23 42
to 0 23 42
find 0 23 42
in 0 23 42
it 0 23 42
spiritual 0 23 42
nourishment. 0 23 42

This 0 23 43
was, 0 23 43
remember, 0 23 43
1965, 0 23 43
four 0 23 43
years 0 23 43
before 0 23 43
the 0 23 43
New 0 23 43
Mass 0 23 43
was 0 23 43
issued 0 23 43
and 0 23 43
before 0 23 43
Cardinal 0 23 43
Ottaviani 0 23 43
warned 0 23 43
the 0 23 43
pope 0 23 43
that 0 23 43
it 0 23 43
was 0 23 43
precisely 0 23 43
this 1 23 43
sacramental 1 23 43
reality 1 23 43
that 1 23 43
was 1 23 43
about 1 23 43
to 1 23 43
be 1 23 43
catastrophically 1 23 43

obscured. 1 23 44
Who, 0 23 44
reading 0 23 44
this 0 23 44
passage, 0 23 44
does 0 23 44
not 0 23 44
feel 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
urge 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
shout 0 23 44
down 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
years, 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
do 0 23 44
something 0 23 44
to 0 23 44
stave 0 23 44
off 0 23 44
the 0 23 44
disaster 0 23 44
that 0 23 44

was 0 23 45
coming: 0 23 45
[W]e 0 23 45
are 0 23 45
aware 0 23 45
of 0 23 45
the 0 23 45
fact 0 23 45
that, 0 23 45
among 0 23 45
those 0 23 45
who 0 23 45
deal 0 23 45
with 0 23 45
this 0 23 45
Most 0 23 45
Holy 0 23 45
Mystery 0 23 45
in 0 23 45

some 0 23 45

either 0 23 45
to 0 23 45

in 0 23 45

abroad 0 23 45
opinions 0 23 45
which 0 23 45
disturb 0 23 45
the 0 23 45

confusion 0 23 45
about 0 23 45

of 0 23 46
faith. 0 23 46
It 0 23 46
is 0 23 46
as 0 23 46
if 0 23 46
everyone 0 23 46
were 0 23 46
permitted 0 23 46
to 0 23 46

it 0 23 46
in 0 23 46
such 0 23 46
a 0 23 46
way 0 23 46
as 0 23 46
to 0 23 46
weaken 0 23 46
the 0 23 46
genuine 0 23 46

of 0 23 46

involved. 0 23 47
Keeping 0 23 47
Cardinal 0 23 47
Ottaviani’s 0 23 47
Intervention 0 23 47
directly 0 23 47
before 0 23 47
our 0 23 47
thoughts, 0 23 47
we 0 23 47
read 0 23 47
with 0 23 47
a 0 23 47
strange 0 23 47
kind 0 23 47
of 0 23 47
helpless 0 23 47

dread… 0 23 48
…it 1 23 48
is 1 23 48
not 1 23 48
allowable 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
emphasize 1 23 48
what 1 23 48
is 1 23 48
called 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
“communal” 1 23 48
Mass 1 23 48
to 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
disparagement 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
Masses 1 23 48
celebrated 1 23 48
in 1 23 48

the 1 23 48
element 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
sacramental 1 23 48
sign 1 23 48

if 1 23 48

all 1 23 48
certainly 1 23 48
admit 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
Eucharist, 1 23 48
expresses 1 23 48
fully 1 23 48
and 1 23 48
exhausts 1 23 48
completely 1 23 48
the 1 23 48
mode 1 23 48
of 1 23 48
Christ’s 1 23 48
presence 1 23 48
in 1 23 48
this 1 23 48

sacrament. 1 23 49
Nor 1 23 49
is 1 23 49
it 1 23 49
allowable 1 23 49
to 1 23 49
discuss 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
mystery 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
transubstantiation 1 23 49
without 1 23 49
mentioning 1 23 49
what 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Council 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
Trent 1 23 49
stated 1 23 49
about 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
marvelous 1 23 49
conversion 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
whole 1 23 49
substance 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
bread 1 23 49
into 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Body 1 23 49

of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
whole 1 23 49
substance 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
wine 1 23 49
into 1 23 49
the 1 23 49
Blood 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
Christ, 1 23 49
speaking 1 23 49
rather 1 23 49
only 1 23 49
of 1 23 49
what 1 23 49
is 1 23 49
called 1 23 49
“transignification” 1 23 49
and 1 23 49
“transfiguration,” 1 23 49
or 0 23 49
finally 0 23 49
to 0 23 49

act 0 23 49
upon 0 23 49
the 0 23 49

of 0 23 49
the 0 23 49

this 0 23 51

of 0 23 51
false 0 23 51

with 0 23 51
apostolic 0 23 51

about 0 23 53

marriage. 0 23 54
It’s 0 23 54
about 0 23 54
the 0 23 54
Eucharist 0 23 54
and 0 23 54
to 0 23 54
a 0 23 54
lesser 0 23 54
extent 0 23 54
the 0 23 54

priesthood. 0 23 55
The 1 23 55
demonic 1 23 55
forces 1 23 55
we 1 23 55
know 1 23 55
are 1 23 55
the 1 23 55
driving 1 23 55
force 1 23 55
behind 1 23 55
this 1 23 55
supreme 1 23 55
moment 1 23 55
of 1 23 55
heresy 1 23 55
and 1 23 55
destruction 1 23 55
aren’t 1 23 55
really 1 23 55
looking 1 23 55
at 1 23 55
the 1 23 55
undermining 1 23 55
of 1 23 55
marriage 1 23 55
as 1 23 55
their 1 23 55
primary 1 23 55
goal; 1 23 55
they 1 23 55
want 1 23 55
to 1 23 55
get 1 23 55
at 1 23 55
the 1 23 55

Eucharist. 1 23 56
We 1 23 56
know 1 23 56
it 1 23 56
is 1 23 56
demonically 1 23 56
inspired 1 23 56
because 1 23 56
their 1 23 56
hatred 1 23 56
is 1 23 56
for 1 23 56
Christ 1 23 56
Himself 1 23 56
in 1 23 56
the 1 23 56
first 1 23 56
place 1 23 56
and 1 23 56
for 1 23 56
anyone 1 23 56
who 1 23 56
loves 1 23 56
and 1 23 56
wants 1 23 56
to 1 23 56
serve 1 23 56

Him 1 23 57
second. 1 23 57
They 1 23 57
are 1 23 57
men 1 23 57
who 1 23 57
refuse 1 23 57
to 1 23 57
bend 1 23 57
the 1 23 57
knee 1 23 57
before 1 23 57
the 1 23 57
God 1 23 57
whom 1 23 57
they 1 23 57
will 1 23 57

not 1 23 58
serve. 1 23 58
This 0 23 58
knowledge 0 23 58
– 0 23 58
that 0 23 58
the 0 23 58
attack 0 23 58
is 0 23 58
on 0 23 58
the 0 23 58
Body 0 23 58
and 0 23 58
Blood 0 23 58
of 0 23 58
Christ 0 23 58
– 0 23 58
can 0 23 58
also 0 23 58
help 0 23 58
readers 0 23 58
spot 0 23 58
their 0 23 58
friends 0 23 58

in 0 23 59
the 0 23 59
crowd. 0 23 59
The 0 23 59
places 0 23 59
where 0 23 59
Eucharistic 0 23 59
adoration 0 23 59
is 0 23 59
still 0 23 59
offered 0 23 59
are 0 23 59
places 0 23 59
where 0 23 59
at 0 23 59
least 0 23 59
some 0 23 59
flicker 0 23 59
of 0 23 59
the 0 23 59
true 0 23 59
Faith 0 23 59

survives. 0 23 60
The 0 23 60
bishops 0 23 60
and 0 23 60
priests 0 23 60
now 0 23 60
talking 0 23 60
about 0 23 60
the 0 23 60
supreme 0 23 60
glory 0 23 60
of 0 23 60
the 0 23 60
Eucharist, 0 23 60
and 0 23 60
the 0 23 60
need 0 23 60
to 0 23 60
defend 0 23 60
it 0 23 60
from 0 23 60
sacrilege, 0 23 60
are 0 23 60

lighthouses. 0 23 61
A 0 23 61
case 0 23 61
in 0 23 61
point 0 23 61
is 0 23 61
Bishop 0 23 61
Mark 0 23 61
Davies, 0 23 61
of 0 23 61
my 0 23 61
own 0 23 61
former 0 23 61
diocese 0 23 61
of 0 23 61
Shrewsbury 0 23 61

in 0 23 62
England. 0 23 62
In 0 23 62
March, 0 23 62
2016, 0 23 62
in 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
midst 0 23 62
of 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
shouting 0 23 62
from 0 23 62
Rome, 0 23 62
Bishop 0 23 62
Davies 0 23 62
spoke 0 23 62
at 0 23 62
his 0 23 62
Chrism 0 23 62
Mass 0 23 62
said 0 23 62
that 0 23 62
only 0 23 62
through 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
“reality 0 23 62
of 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
Eucharist” 0 23 62
could 0 23 62
new 0 23 62
vocations 0 23 62
to 0 23 62
the 0 23 62
priesthood 0 23 62

be 0 23 63
found. 0 23 63
“In 0 23 63
treasuring 0 23 63
this 0 23 63
gift 0 23 63
of 0 23 63
priestly 0 23 63
celibacy 0 23 63
we 0 23 63
need 0 23 63
to 0 23 63
recognize 0 23 63
more 0 23 63
clearly 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
intimate 0 23 63
link 0 23 63
between 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
Ministerial 0 23 63
Priesthood 0 23 63
and 0 23 63
the 0 23 63
reality 0 23 63
of 0 23 63

the 0 23 64
Eucharist. 0 23 64
If 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
Mass 1 23 64
were 1 23 64
ever 1 23 64
reduced 1 23 64
in 1 23 64
our 1 23 64
minds 1 23 64
to 1 23 64
being 1 23 64
merely 1 23 64
a 1 23 64
commemorative 1 23 64
meal 1 23 64
and 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
priest 1 23 64
as 1 23 64
only 1 23 64
a 1 23 64
community 1 23 64
leader 1 23 64
or 1 23 64
functionary, 1 23 64
then 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
celibacy 1 23 64
of 1 23 64
the 1 23 64
Catholic 1 23 64
Priesthood 1 23 64
might 1 23 64
seem 1 23 64

extravagant.” 1 23 65
It’s 0 23 65
almost 0 23 65
as 0 23 65
if 0 23 65
someone 0 23 65
had 0 23 65
slipped 0 23 65
a 0 23 65
copy 0 23 65

the 0 23 65
Ottaviani 0 23 65
Intervention 0 23 65

his 0 23 65

morning 0 23 66
paper. 0 23 66
The 0 23 66
targeting 0 23 66
of 0 23 66
marriage, 0 23 66
through 0 23 66
the 0 23 66
instruments 0 23 66
of 0 23 66
creatures 0 23 66
like 0 23 66
the 0 23 66
myopic 0 23 66
and 0 23 66
theologically 0 23 66
tunnel-visioned 0 23 66
Cardinal 0 23 66
Kasper, 0 23 66
is 1 23 66
demonically 1 23 66

brilliant. 1 23 67
It’s 0 23 67
a 0 23 67
“stitch-up” 0 23 67
as 0 23 67
the 0 23 67
English 0 23 67

call 0 23 68
it; 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
fix. 0 23 68
You 0 23 68
make 0 23 68
it 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
matter 0 23 68
of 0 23 68
“mercy” 0 23 68
(backed 0 23 68
up 0 23 68
by 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
iron 0 23 68
fist) 0 23 68
that 0 23 68
no 0 23 68
one 0 23 68
in 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
state 0 23 68
of 0 23 68
objective 0 23 68
mortal 0 23 68
sin 0 23 68
can 0 23 68
be 0 23 68
refused 0 23 68
Holy 0 23 68
Communion; 0 23 68
you 0 23 68
give 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
national 0 23 68
bishops 0 23 68
conferences 0 23 68
the 0 23 68
power 0 23 68
to 0 23 68
start 0 23 68
enforcing 0 23 68
this, 0 23 68
and 0 23 68
you 0 23 68
have 0 23 68
created 0 23 68
a 0 23 68
previously 0 23 68
unimaginable 0 23 68
situation 0 23 68

in 0 23 69
the 0 23 69
Church. 0 23 69
You 0 23 69
have 0 23 69
created 0 23 69
a 0 23 69
regime 0 23 69
in 0 23 69
which 0 23 69
a 0 23 69
refusal 0 23 69
to 0 23 69
desecrate 0 23 69
the 0 23 69
sacred 0 23 69
species 0 23 69
will 0 23 69
be 0 23 69
grounds 0 23 69
for 0 23 69
persecution 0 23 69
of 0 23 69
faithful 0 23 69
priests, 0 23 69
seminarians 0 23 69

and 0 23 70
laity. 0 23 70
And 0 23 70
of 0 23 70
course, 0 23 70
we 0 23 70
are 0 23 70
seeing 0 23 70
it 0 23 70
starting 0 23 70

already. 0 23 71
It’s 0 23 71
a 0 23 71
brilliant 0 23 71
strategy, 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
magic 0 23 71
bullet 0 23 71
that 0 23 71
will 0 23 71
revert 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
Church 0 23 71
to 0 23 71
the 0 23 71
1976 0 23 71
model 0 23 71
on 0 23 71
every 0 23 71
front, 0 23 71
and 0 23 71
very 0 23 71
likely 0 23 71
keep 0 23 71
it 0 23 71

there 0 23 72
forever. 0 23 72
As 0 23 72
if 0 23 72
the 0 23 72
goal 0 23 72
was 0 23 72
to 0 23 72
go 0 23 72
back 0 23 72
in 0 23 72
time 0 23 72
and 0 23 72
erase 0 23 72
the 0 23 72
entire 0 23 72
John 0 23 72
Paul 0 23 72
II/Benedict 0 23 72
XVI 0 23 72
period 0 23 72

out 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
history. 0 23 73
It 0 23 73
will 0 23 73
halt 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
revival 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
eucharistic 0 23 73
piety 0 23 73
among 0 23 73
seminarians; 0 23 73
in 0 23 73
fact, 0 23 73
it 0 23 73
will 0 23 73
reverse 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
general 0 23 73
reforming 0 23 73
trend 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
“conservative” 0 23 73
seminaries 0 23 73
that 0 23 73
was 0 23 73
such 0 23 73
a 0 23 73
feature 0 23 73
under 0 23 73
John 0 23 73
Paul 0 23 73
II 0 23 73
and 0 23 73
has 0 23 73
for 0 23 73
30 0 23 73
years 0 23 73
been 0 23 73
the 0 23 73
hook 0 23 73
upon 0 23 73
which 0 23 73
all 0 23 73
hopes 0 23 73
of 0 23 73
restoration 0 23 73

have 0 23 74
hung. 0 23 74
It 0 23 74
is 0 23 74
easy 0 23 74
to 0 23 74
see 0 23 74
what 0 23 74

is 0 23 75
coming 0 23 75
next. 0 23 75
Once 0 23 75
certain 0 23 75
announcements 0 23 75
are 0 23 75
published 0 23 75
in 0 23 75
parish 0 23 75
bulletins, 0 23 75
laity 0 23 75
will 0 23 75
have 0 23 75
to 0 23 75
consider 0 23 75
whether 0 23 75
they 0 23 75
can, 0 23 75
in 0 23 75
conscience, 0 23 75
continue 0 23 75
to 0 23 75
assist 0 23 75
at 0 23 75
Masses 0 23 75
where 0 23 75
systematic 0 23 75
sacrilege 0 23 75
has 0 23 75
been 0 23 75
formally 0 23 75
adopted 0 23 75

as 0 23 76
the 0 23 76
rule. 0 23 76
The 0 23 76
few 0 23 76
bishops 0 23 76
with 0 23 76
sufficient 0 23 76
spine 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
stand 0 23 76
up 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
the 0 23 76
pressure 0 23 76
of 0 23 76
both 0 23 76
Rome 0 23 76
and 0 23 76
their 0 23 76
own 0 23 76
national 0 23 76
conferences 0 23 76
– 0 23 76
newly 0 23 76
empowered 0 23 76
with 0 23 76
directives 0 23 76
to 0 23 76
make 0 23 76
doctrinal 0 23 76
declarations 0 23 76
– 0 23 76
will 1 23 76
be 1 23 76
ruling 1 23 76
embattled 1 23 76
islands 1 23 76
of 1 23 76
Catholicism 1 23 76
in 1 23 76
a 1 23 76
poisoned 1 23 76
sea 1 23 76
of 1 23 76
systematic 1 23 76
heresy 1 23 76

and 1 23 77
desecration. 1 23 77
A 1 23 77
dark, 1 23 77
impenetrable 1 23 77
and 1 23 77
“irreversible” 1 23 77
winter 1 23 77
of 1 23 77
persecution 1 23 77
of 1 23 77
the 1 23 77
faithful 1 23 77
by 1 23 77
their 1 23 77
own 1 23 77
shepherds 1 23 77

will 1 23 78
fall. 1 23 78
Not 0 23 78
being 0 23 78
a 0 23 78
theologian 0 23 78
I 0 23 78
have 0 23 78
no 0 23 78
idea 0 23 78
if 0 23 78
this 0 23 78
encyclical 0 23 78
is, 0 23 78
as 0 23 78
so 0 23 78
many 0 23 78
of 0 23 78
these 0 23 78
seemingly 0 23 78
orthodox 0 23 78
documents 0 23 78
of 0 23 78
that 0 23 78
period 0 23 78
seem 0 23 78
to 0 23 78
be, 0 23 78
rife 0 23 78
with 0 23 78
the 0 23 78
usual 0 23 78
“time 0 23 78
bombs,” 0 23 78
ambiguities, 0 23 78
mushy 0 23 78
language 0 23 78
or 0 23 78
even 0 23 78

outright 0 23 79
errors. 0 23 79
I 0 23 79
haven’t 0 23 79

looked 0 23 80
it 0 23 80
up. 0 23 80
I’m 0 23 80
sure 0 23 80
there 0 23 80
are 0 23 80
plenty 0 23 80
of 0 23 80
people 0 23 80
out 0 23 80
there 0 23 80
qualified 0 23 80
to 0 23 80
examine 0 23 80
it 0 23 80
to 0 23 80
see 0 23 80
if 0 23 80
it’s 0 23 80
safe 0 23 80
for 0 23 80
Trad-Catholic 0 23 80

consumption. 0 23 81
And 0 23 81
I 0 23 81
have 0 23 81
no 0 23 81
doubt 0 23 81
at 0 23 81
all 0 23 81
that 0 23 81
there 0 23 81
are 0 23 81
better, 0 23 81
more 0 23 81
venerable, 0 23 81
even 0 23 81
more 0 23 81
sublime 0 23 81
and 0 23 81
poignant 0 23 81
works 0 23 81
on 0 23 81
the 0 23 81
Eucharist 0 23 81
in 0 23 81
the 0 23 81
canon 0 23 81
of 0 23 81

“official” 0 23 82
things. 0 23 82
From 0 23 82
saints 0 23 82
and 0 23 82
Doctors 0 23 82
of 0 23 82
the 0 23 82
Church 0 23 82
and 0 23 82
whatnot, 0 23 82
many 0 23 82
of 0 23 82
which 0 23 82

the 0 23 83
pope 0 23 83
cited. 0 23 83
But 1 23 83
whatever 1 23 83
its 1 23 83
flaws, 1 23 83
Mysterium 1 23 83
Fidei 1 23 83
is 1 23 83
the 1 23 83
one 1 23 83
I 1 23 83
found, 1 23 83
and 1 23 83
I’m 1 23 83
convinced 1 23 83
it 1 23 83
wasn’t 1 23 83

an 1 23 84
accident. 1 23 84
O 0 23 84

a 0 26 2
series 1 26 2
of 1 26 2
shocking 1 26 2
comments 1 26 2
that 0 26 2
correlate 0 26 2
with 0 26 2

“I 0 26 3
definitely 0 26 3

there 0 26 3
was 0 26 3

man 0 26 4

that 0 26 4
after 0 26 4
being 0 26 4
shot 0 26 4
he 0 26 4
ran 0 26 4
“about 0 26 4

yards” 0 26 4
to 0 26 4
hide 0 26 4
behind 0 26 4
a 0 26 4
car, 0 26 4
all 0 26 4
the 0 26 4
while 0 26 4
hearing 0 26 4
bullets 0 26 4
fly 0 26 4
past 0 26 4
him 0 26 4
at 0 26 4
what 0 26 4
he 0 26 4
believes 0 26 4
was 0 26 4
ground 0 26 4
level. 0 26 4

“I’m 0 26 5
waiting 0 26 5
and 0 26 5
all 0 26 5
of 0 26 5
a 0 26 5
sudden 0 26 5
we 0 26 5
hear 0 26 5
a 0 26 5
little 0 26 5
whizzing 0 26 5
going 0 26 5
by 0 26 5
us, 0 26 5
all 0 26 5
of 0 26 5
a 0 26 5
sudden 0 26 5
bullets 0 26 5
are 0 26 5
just 0 26 5
flying 0 26 5
by,” 0 26 5

continued. 0 26 5

“When 0 26 6
something 0 26 6
is 0 26 6
coming 0 26 6
up 0 26 6

down 0 26 6

at 0 26 6

from 0 26 6
a 0 26 6
different 0 26 6
angle 0 26 6
they 0 26 6
are 0 26 6
either 0 26 6
going 0 26 6
to 0 26 6

the 0 26 6
ground 0 26 6
or… 0 26 6
alot 0 26 6
of 0 26 6
different 0 26 6
things 0 26 6
are 0 26 6
going 0 26 6

someone 0 26 7
is 0 26 7
shooting 0 26 7

keep 0 26 7
shooting,” 0 26 7
Palermo 0 26 7
attempted 0 26 7
to 0 26 7
explain. 0 26 7

Take 1 26 8
note 1 26 8
that 1 26 8
what 1 26 8
he 1 26 8
means 1 26 8
here 1 26 8
is 1 26 8
that 1 26 8
people 1 26 8
were 1 26 8
being 1 26 8
shot 1 26 8
at 1 26 8
from 1 26 8
ground 1 26 8
level 1 26 8
rather 1 26 8
than 1 26 8
the 1 26 8
32nd 1 26 8
floor 1 26 8
of 1 26 8
the 1 26 8
hotel. 1 26 8

Palermo 0 26 9
then 0 26 9
specifically 0 26 9
heard 0 26 9
the 0 26 9
gun 0 26 9
shots 0 26 9
get 0 26 9
“closer 0 26 9
and 0 26 9
closer” 0 26 9
before 0 26 9
quickly 0 26 9
deciding 0 26 9
it 0 26 9
was 0 26 9
once 0 26 9
again 0 26 9
time 0 26 9
to 0 26 9

he 0 26 10
then 0 26 10
goes 0 26 10
on 0 26 10

the 0 26 10

of 0 26 10
the 0 26 10

this 0 26 10

down 0 26 10

“At 0 26 12

only 0 26 14

Palermo 0 26 15
makes 0 26 15
clear 0 26 15
this 0 26 15
confused 0 26 15
concert 0 26 15
goers 0 26 15
who 0 26 15
had 0 26 15
used 0 26 15
the 0 26 15
normal 0 26 15

There 0 26 17
were 0 26 17

that 0 26 17
went 0 26 17
over 0 26 17

tried 0 26 17
to 0 26 17

there 0 26 17

no, 0 26 17
you 0 26 17
can’t 0 26 17

narrative 0 28 5
now 0 28 5
though, 0 28 5
seems 0 28 5
to 0 28 5
swirl 0 28 5
around 0 28 5
this 0 28 5
unknown 0 28 5
mystery 0 28 5
security 0 28 5
guard. 0 28 5

At 0 28 6
first, 0 28 6
Campos, 0 28 6
a 0 28 6
guard 0 28 6
at 0 28 6
the 0 28 6
Mandalay 0 28 6
Bay 0 28 6
Resort 0 28 6
and 0 28 6
Casino, 0 28 6
was 0 28 6
hailed 0 28 6
a 0 28 6
hero 0 28 6
for 0 28 6
helping 0 28 6
guide 0 28 6
police 0 28 6
to 0 28 6
gunman 0 28 6
Stephen 0 28 6
Paddock’s 0 28 6
room 0 28 6
on 0 28 6
the 0 28 6
32nd 0 28 6
floor. 0 28 6

Police 0 28 7
said 0 28 7
Campos 0 28 7
was 0 28 7
shot 0 28 7
in 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
leg 0 28 7
at 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
end 0 28 7
of 0 28 7
Paddock’s 0 28 7
assault 0 28 7
on 0 28 7
concertgoers—potentially 0 28 7
distracting 0 28 7
the 0 28 7
gunman 0 28 7
and 0 28 7
causing 0 28 7
him 0 28 7
to 0 28 7
panic 0 28 7
and 0 28 7
kill 0 28 7
himself. 0 28 7

But 0 28 8
now, 0 28 8
questions 0 28 8
have 0 28 8
been 0 28 8
raised 0 28 8
after 0 28 8
Clark 0 28 8
County 0 28 8
Sheriff 0 28 8
Joe 0 28 8
Lombardo 0 28 8
revised 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
timeline 0 28 8
and 0 28 8
said 0 28 8
Campos 0 28 8
had 0 28 8
actually 0 28 8
been 0 28 8
shot 0 28 8
about 0 28 8
9:59 0 28 8
p.m. 0 28 8
a 0 28 8
(full 0 28 8
six 0 28 8
minutes 0 28 8
before 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
mass 0 28 8
shooting 0 28 8
began 0 28 8
at 0 28 8
10:05 0 28 8
p.m.) 0 28 8
which 0 28 8
means 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
guard 0 28 8
could 0 28 8
have 0 28 8
instead 0 28 8
led 0 28 8
Paddock 0 28 8
to 0 28 8
start 0 28 8
opening 0 28 8
fire 0 28 8
on 0 28 8
the 0 28 8
crowd 0 28 8
for 0 28 8
fear 0 28 8
of 0 28 8
being 0 28 8
caught. 0 28 8

Police 0 28 9
have 0 28 9
said 0 28 9
it 0 28 9
was 0 28 9
difficult 0 28 9
to 0 28 9
identify 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
source 0 28 9
of 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
bullets 0 28 9
during 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
attack, 0 28 9
and 0 28 9
the 0 28 9
confusion 0 28 9
added 0 28 9
more 0 28 9
minutes 0 28 9
to 0 28 9
their 0 28 9
lengthy 0 28 9
response. 0 28 9

But 0 28 10
the 0 28 10
revised 0 28 10
timeline 0 28 10
shows 0 28 10
officers 0 28 10
would 0 28 10
have 0 28 10
known 0 28 10
where 0 28 10
Paddock 0 28 10
was 0 28 10
before 0 28 10
the 0 28 10
mass 0 28 10
shooting 0 28 10
even 0 28 10
started. 0 28 10

Did 0 28 11
Campos 0 28 11
call 0 28 11
911? 0 28 11

What 0 28 12
happened 0 28 12
during 0 28 12
those 0 28 12
six 0 28 12
minutes? 0 28 12

Much 0 28 13
of 0 28 13
Campos’s 0 28 13
story 0 28 13
and 0 28 13
background 0 28 13
remains 0 28 13
a 0 28 13
mystery. 0 28 13

–Newsweek 0 28 14

Campos’s 0 28 15
co-worker 0 28 15
Liliana 0 28 15
Rodriguez 0 28 15
started 0 28 15
a 0 28 15

account 0 28 15
for 0 28 15
him 0 28 15
on 0 28 15
October 0 28 15

explaining 0 28 15
that 0 28 15
he’d 0 28 15
been 0 28 15
shot 0 28 15
while 0 28 15
on 0 28 15
“random 0 28 15

and 0 28 15
it 0 28 15
could 0 28 15
have 0 28 15
been 0 28 15
anyone 0 28 15
of 0 28 15

says. 0 28 16

“This 0 28 17

Strangely, 0 28 19
a 0 28 19
picture 0 28 19
of 0 28 19
Campos 0 28 19
wasn’t 0 28 19

as 0 28 19
part 0 28 19
of 0 28 19

indicated 0 28 19
that 0 28 19
“due 0 28 19
to 0 28 19
privacy 0 28 19
from 0 28 19

There 1 28 20
are 1 28 20
obviously 1 28 20
certain 1 28 20
things 1 28 20
that 1 28 20
the 1 28 20
FBI 1 28 20

seem 1 28 20
intent 1 28 20
on 1 28 20
covering 1 28 20
up. 1 28 20

Their 0 28 21
own 0 28 21

quickly 0 28 21
shattering. 0 28 21

the 0 28 22

in 0 28 22
some 0 28 22
of 0 28 22
what 0 28 22

it 0 28 22
only 0 28 22
added 0 28 22

in 0 28 22

McMahill 0 28 23
told 0 28 23
KNPR, 0 28 23
a 0 28 23
local 0 28 23
NPR 0 28 23
affiliate, 0 28 23
that 0 28 23
Campos 0 28 23
went 0 28 23
up 0 28 23
to 0 28 23
the 0 28 23
32nd 0 28 23
floor 0 28 23
to 0 28 23
investigate 0 28 23
a 0 28 23
door 0 28 23
alarm. 0 28 23

While 0 28 24
on 0 28 24
the 0 28 24
32nd 0 28 24
floor, 0 28 24
he 0 28 24
found 0 28 24
that 0 28 24
a 0 28 24
stairwell 0 28 24
door 0 28 24
was 0 28 24
jammed 0 28 24
and 0 28 24
radioed 0 28 24
down 0 28 24
to 0 28 24
maintenance. 0 28 24

Campos 0 28 25
heard 0 28 25
a 0 28 25
drilling 0 28 25
sound 0 28 25
and 0 28 25
thought 0 28 25
it 0 28 25
was 0 28 25
odd. 0 28 25

A 0 28 26
maintenance 0 28 26
worker 0 28 26
came 0 28 26
up 0 28 26
to 0 28 26
the 0 28 26
32nd 0 28 26
floor. 0 28 26

As 0 28 27
the 0 28 27
pair 0 28 27
started 0 28 27
talking, 0 28 27
Paddock 0 28 27
began 0 28 27
firing 0 28 27
through 0 28 27
the 0 28 27
door 0 28 27
of 0 28 27
his 0 28 27
room, 0 28 27
first 0 28 27
with 0 28 27
a 0 28 27
single-fire 0 28 27
gun 0 28 27
and 0 28 27
then 0 28 27
with 0 28 27
a 0 28 27
rapid-fire 0 28 27
rifle. 0 28 27

Police 0 28 28
have 0 28 28
said 0 28 28
that 0 28 28
when 0 28 28
Campos 0 28 28
radioed 0 28 28
what 0 28 28
happened, 0 28 28
it 0 28 28
helped 0 28 28
them 0 28 28
track 0 28 28
where 0 28 28
Paddock 0 28 28
was 0 28 28
holed 0 28 28
up 0 28 28
– 0 28 28
so 1 28 28
why 1 28 28
change 1 28 28
the 1 28 28
narrative 1 28 28
to 1 28 28
make 1 28 28
it 1 28 28
even 1 28 28
more 1 28 28
unbelievable? 1 28 28

And 0 28 29
still, 0 28 29
none 0 28 29
of 0 28 29
this 0 28 29
explains 0 28 29
why 0 28 29
Campos 0 28 29
is 0 28 29
not 0 28 29
registered 0 28 29
as 0 28 29
a 0 28 29
security 0 28 29
guard 0 28 29
either, 0 28 29
and 0 28 29
why 0 28 29
the 0 28 29
timeline 0 28 29
is 0 28 29
being 0 28 29
changed 0 28 29

exactly 1 28 30
do 1 28 30
they 1 28 30
want 1 28 30

This 0 256 1
has 0 256 1
long 0 256 1
been 0 256 1
known, 0 256 1
although 0 256 1
the 0 256 1
mainstream 0 256 1

dismissed 0 256 1
it 0 256 1
as 0 256 1
a 0 256 1
conspiracy 0 256 1
theory. 0 256 1

But 0 256 2
now 0 256 2
we 0 256 2
have 0 256 2
definitive 0 256 2
confirmation. 0 256 2

It 0 256 3
was 0 256 3
Iran 0 256 3
Bush 0 256 3
should 0 256 3
have 0 256 3

after 0 256 3
9/11 0 256 3
, 0 256 3
not 0 256 3
Iraq. 0 256 3

Now 0 256 4
consider 0 256 4
this: 0 256 4
even 0 256 4
though, 0 256 4
as 0 256 4

the 0 256 4

does 0 256 4
not 0 256 4
have, 0 256 4
and 0 256 4
certainly 0 256 4
knew 0 256 4
of 0 256 4
Iran’s 0 256 4
involvement 0 256 4
in 0 256 4
the 0 256 4

academic 0 257 25
should 0 257 25
do, 0 257 25
attempt 0 257 25
to 0 257 25
test 0 257 25
ideas 0 257 25
and 0 257 25
consider 0 257 25
alternative 0 257 25
explanations. 0 257 25

(Oddly 0 257 26
enough, 0 257 26
this 0 257 26
makes 0 257 26
it 0 257 26
rather 0 257 26
like 0 257 26
the 0 257 26
groups 0 257 26
it 0 257 26
claims 0 257 26
to 0 257 26

And 0 257 27
the 0 257 27
label 0 257 27
of 0 257 27
“violent 1 257 27
extremist” 1 257 27
turns 0 257 27
out 0 257 27
to 0 257 27
be 0 257 27
used 0 257 27
very 0 257 27
generously. 0 257 27

Ganesh 0 257 28
makes 0 257 28
wild 1 257 28
leaps 0 257 28
and 0 257 28
inferences. 0 257 28

He 0 257 29
talks 0 257 29
of 0 257 29
Darren 0 257 29
Osborne, 0 257 29
the 0 257 29
perpetrator 0 257 29
of 0 257 29
the 0 257 29
vehicular 0 257 29
attack 0 257 29
on 0 257 29
Finsbury 0 257 29
Park 0 257 29
Mosque. 0 257 29

This 0 257 30
was 0 257 30
a 0 257 30
heinous 1 257 30
crime, 0 257 30
and 0 257 30
should 0 257 30
rightly 0 257 30
be 0 257 30
condemned. 0 257 30

But 0 257 31
why 0 257 31
did 0 257 31
Osborne 0 257 31
do 0 257 31
this, 0 257 31
according 0 257 31
to 0 257 31
Ganesh? 0 257 31

The 0 257 32
attack 0 257 32
“was 0 257 32
executed 0 257 32
after 0 257 32
he 0 257 32
had 0 257 32
become 0 257 32
indignant 0 257 32
after 0 257 32
watching 0 257 32
a 0 257 32
BBC 0 257 32
broadcast 0 257 32
on 0 257 32
child 0 257 32
sexual 0 257 32
exploitation 0 257 32
and 0 257 32
turned 0 257 32
to 0 257 32
social 0 257 32
media 0 257 32
to 0 257 32
make 0 257 32
sense 0 257 32
of 0 257 32
it. 0 257 32

He 0 257 33
found 0 257 33
a 0 257 33
narrative 0 257 33
from 0 257 33
British 0 257 33
counter-jihad 0 257 33
groups 0 257 33
closely 0 257 33
aligned 0 257 33
with 0 257 33
the 0 257 33
alt-right, 0 257 33
such 0 257 33
as 0 257 33

and 0 257 33
the 0 257 33

English 0 257 33

Tommy 0 257 33
Robinson.” 0 257 33
The 0 257 33
British 0 257 33
counter-jihad 0 257 33
movement 0 257 33
is 0 257 33
thus 0 257 33
swept 0 257 33
into 0 257 33
the 0 257 33
same 0 257 33
group 0 257 33
of 0 257 33
violent 1 257 33
extremists 1 257 33
as 0 257 33
Osborne, 0 257 33
because 0 257 33
Ganesh 0 257 33
“knows” 1 257 33
they 0 257 33
encouraged 0 257 33
him. 0 257 33

The 0 257 34
BBC 0 257 34
broadcast 0 257 34
was 0 257 34
the 0 257 34
drama 0 257 34
based 0 257 34
on 0 257 34
real 0 257 34
life, 0 257 34
Three 0 257 34
Girls, 0 257 34
which 0 257 34
showed 0 257 34
real-life 0 257 34
events 0 257 34
of 0 257 34
three 0 257 34
of 0 257 34
the 0 257 34
(very 0 257 34
many) 0 257 34
victims 0 257 34
of 0 257 34
the 0 257 34
Rochdale 0 257 34
Muslim 0 257 34
rape 0 257 34
gangs. 0 257 34

Ganesh 0 257 35
somehow 0 257 35
knows 0 257 35
precisely 0 257 35
what 0 257 35
went 0 257 35
on 0 257 35
in 0 257 35
Osborne’s 0 257 35
mind. 0 257 35

Rather 0 257 36
than 0 257 36
thinking 0 257 36
that 0 257 36
it 0 257 36
was 0 257 36
outrage 0 257 36
at 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
behavior 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
gangs 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
Muslim 0 257 36
men 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
Pakistani 0 257 36
background 0 257 36
who 0 257 36
abused 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
girls 0 257 36
portrayed 0 257 36
in 0 257 36
Three 0 257 36
Girls 0 257 36
that 0 257 36
caused 0 257 36
Osborne 0 257 36
to 0 257 36
lose 0 257 36
his 0 257 36
mind 0 257 36
and 0 257 36
commit 0 257 36
his 0 257 36
terrible 1 257 36
crime, 0 257 36
Ganesh 0 257 36
blames 0 257 36
Obsorne’s 0 257 36
act 0 257 36
on 0 257 36
the 0 257 36
likes 0 257 36
of 0 257 36
Tommy 0 257 36
Robinson. 0 257 36

Yet 0 257 37
Robinson 0 257 37
explicitly 0 257 37
fights 0 257 37
AGAINST 1 257 37
political 0 257 37
violence. 0 257 37

What 1 257 38
“narrative 1 257 38
from 1 257 38
British 1 257 38
counter-jihad 1 257 38
groups” 1 257 38
can 1 257 38
one 1 257 38
find 1 257 38
which 1 257 38
suggests 1 257 38
driving 1 257 38
vehicles 1 257 38
into 1 257 38
innocent 1 257 38
Muslims 1 257 38
standing 1 257 38
outside 1 257 38
a 1 257 38
mosque? 1 257 38

I’m 0 257 39
sure 0 257 39
if 0 257 39
there 0 257 39
was 0 257 39
any, 0 257 39
Ganesh 0 257 39
would, 0 257 39
as 0 257 39
a 0 257 39
researcher 0 257 39
at 0 257 39
an 0 257 39
elite 0 257 39
institution, 0 257 39
be 0 257 39
able 0 257 39
to 0 257 39
find 0 257 39
it. 0 257 39

But 0 257 40
there 1 257 40
is 1 257 40
none 1 257 40
offered 1 257 40
– 0 257 40
only 0 257 40
surmise 0 257 40
and 0 257 40
Ganesh’s 0 257 40
mindreading 0 257 40
techniques. 0 257 40

I 0 257 41
suppose 0 257 41
if 0 257 41
you’re 0 257 41
paid 0 257 41
to 0 257 41
fight 0 257 41
online 0 257 41
extremism, 0 257 41
you’d 0 257 41
better 0 257 41
find 0 257 41
it, 0 257 41
or 0 257 41
you’re 0 257 41
out 0 257 41
of 0 257 41
a 0 257 41
job 0 257 41
and 0 257 41
short 0 257 41
of 0 257 41
academic 0 257 41
publication. 0 257 41

We 0 257 42
have 0 257 42
also 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
ridiculous 1 257 42
idea 0 257 42
that 0 257 42
Tommy 0 257 42
Robinson 0 257 42
is 0 257 42
“alt-right.” 0 257 42
He, 0 257 42
in 0 257 42
fact, 0 257 42
describes 0 257 42
himself 0 257 42
as 0 257 42
a 0 257 42
centrist 0 257 42
– 0 257 42
he’s 0 257 42
said 0 257 42
he 0 257 42
agrees 0 257 42
with 0 257 42
Labour 0 257 42
on 0 257 42
some 0 257 42
things, 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
Tories 0 257 42
on 0 257 42
other 0 257 42
things, 0 257 42
and 0 257 42
he 0 257 42
left 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
EDL 0 257 42
precisely 0 257 42
because 0 257 42
he 0 257 42
didn’t 0 257 42
like 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
infiltration 0 257 42
by 0 257 42
the 0 257 42
far 0 257 42
right. 0 257 42

He 0 257 43
shows 0 257 43
no 0 257 43
hint 0 257 43
of 0 257 43
racism 0 257 43
or 0 257 43
of 0 257 43
white 0 257 43
supremacism. 0 257 43

The 0 257 44
writer 0 257 44

this 0 257 44

We 0 257 45
have 0 257 45
to 0 257 45
ask. 0 257 45

Is 0 257 46
it 0 257 46
simply 0 257 46
a 0 257 46
coincidence 0 257 46
that 0 257 46

is 0 257 46
now 0 257 46
in 0 257 46

that 0 257 46
a 0 257 46

who 0 257 46
presents 0 257 46
such 0 257 46
a 0 257 46
misleading 0 257 46
account 0 257 46
of 0 257 46

“Russia-gate 0 258 5

Pilger’s 0 258 6
Statement 0 258 6

“There 0 258 7
is 0 258 7
a 0 258 7
silence 0 258 7

The 0 258 8
silence 0 258 8
is 0 258 8
Julian 0 258 8

As 0 258 9
every 0 258 9

the 1 258 10

of 1 258 10

The 1 258 11
fakery 1 258 11
of 0 258 11
Russia-gate, 0 258 11
the 0 258 11

raw 1 258 11

They 0 258 12
have 0 258 12
not 0 258 12
won, 0 258 12
not 0 258 12
yet, 0 258 12
and 0 258 12
they 0 258 12
have 1 258 12
not 1 258 12
destroyed 1 258 12
the 1 258 12

Only 1 258 13
the 1 258 13
silence 1 258 13
of 1 258 13
good 1 258 13

Dennis 0 258 18
Bernstein: 0 258 18
We 0 258 18
continue 0 258 18
our 0 258 18
discussion 0 258 18
of 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
case 0 258 18
of 0 258 18
Julian 0 258 18
Assange, 0 258 18
now 0 258 18
in 0 258 18
the 0 258 18
Ecuadorian 0 258 18
embassy 0 258 18
in 0 258 18
Great 0 258 18
Britain. 0 258 18

John 0 258 19
Pilger, 0 258 19
it 0 258 19
is 0 258 19
great 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
talk 0 258 19
to 0 258 19
you 0 258 19
again. 0 258 19

But 0 258 20
it 0 258 20
is 0 258 20
a 1 258 20
profound 1 258 20
tragedy, 1 258 20
John, 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
way 0 258 20
they 0 258 20
are 0 258 20
treating 0 258 20
Julian 0 258 20
Assange, 0 258 20
this 0 258 20
prolific 1 258 20
journalist 1 258 20
and 1 258 20
publisher 1 258 20
who 0 258 20
so 0 258 20
many 0 258 20
other 0 258 20
journalists 0 258 20
have 0 258 20
depended 0 258 20
on 0 258 20
in 0 258 20
the 0 258 20
past. 0 258 20

He 0 258 21
has 0 258 21
been 0 258 21
totally 1 258 21
left 1 258 21
out 1 258 21
in 1 258 21
the 1 258 21
cold 1 258 21
to 1 258 21
fend 1 258 21
for 1 258 21
himself. 1 258 21

John 0 258 22
Pilger: 0 258 22
I 0 258 22
have 0 258 22
never 0 258 22
known 0 258 22
anything 0 258 22
like 0 258 22
it. 0 258 22

There 0 258 23
is 0 258 23
a 0 258 23
kind 0 258 23
of 0 258 23
eerie 1 258 23
silence 1 258 23
around 0 258 23
the 0 258 23
Julian 0 258 23
Assange 0 258 23
case. 0 258 23

Julian 0 258 24
has 0 258 24
been 0 258 24
vindicated 0 258 24
in 0 258 24
every 0 258 24
possible 0 258 24
way 0 258 24
and 0 258 24
yet 0 258 24
he 0 258 24
is 0 258 24
isolated 0 258 24
as 0 258 24
few 0 258 24
people 0 258 24
are 0 258 24
these 0 258 24
days. 0 258 24

He 0 258 25
is 0 258 25
cut 0 258 25
off 0 258 25
from 0 258 25
the 0 258 25
very 0 258 25
tools 0 258 25
of 0 258 25
his 0 258 25
trade, 0 258 25
visitors 0 258 25
aren’t 0 258 25
allowed. 0 258 25

I 0 258 26
was 0 258 26
in 0 258 26
London 0 258 26
recently 0 258 26
and 0 258 26
I 0 258 26
couldn’t 0 258 26
see 0 258 26
him, 0 258 26
although 0 258 26
I 0 258 26
spoke 0 258 26
to 0 258 26
people 0 258 26
who 0 258 26
had 0 258 26
seen 0 258 26
him. 0 258 26

Rafael 0 258 27
Correa, 0 258 27
the 0 258 27
former 0 258 27
president 0 258 27
of 0 258 27
Ecuador, 0 258 27
said 0 258 27
recently 0 258 27
that 0 258 27
he 1 258 27
regarded 1 258 27
what 1 258 27
they 1 258 27
are 1 258 27
doing 1 258 27
to 1 258 27
Julian 1 258 27
now 1 258 27
as 1 258 27
torture. 1 258 27

It 0 258 28
was 0 258 28
Correa’s 0 258 28
government 0 258 28
that 0 258 28
gave 0 258 28
Julian 0 258 28
political 0 258 28
refuge, 0 258 28
which 0 258 28
has 0 258 28
been 0 258 28
betrayed 0 258 28
now 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
his 0 258 28
successor, 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
government 0 258 28
led 0 258 28
by 0 258 28
Lenin 0 258 28
Moreno, 0 258 28
which 0 258 28
is 0 258 28
back 0 258 28
to 0 258 28
sucking 1 258 28
up 1 258 28
to 1 258 28
the 1 258 28
United 1 258 28
States 1 258 28
in 1 258 28
the 1 258 28
time-honored 1 258 28
way, 1 258 28
with 0 258 28
Julian 0 258 28
as 0 258 28
the 0 258 28
pawn 0 258 28
and 0 258 28
victim. 0 258 28

Should 0 258 29
be 0 258 29
a 1 258 29
‘Constitutional 1 258 29
Hero’ 1 258 29

But 0 258 30
really 0 258 30
it 0 258 30
comes 0 258 30
down 0 258 30
to 0 258 30
the 0 258 30
British 0 258 30
government. 0 258 30

Although 0 258 31
he 0 258 31
is 0 258 31
still 0 258 31
in 0 258 31
a 0 258 31
foreign 0 258 31
embassy 0 258 31
and 0 258 31
actually 0 258 31
has 0 258 31
Ecuadorian 0 258 31
nationality, 0 258 31
his 0 258 31
right 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
passage 0 258 31
out 0 258 31
of 0 258 31
that 0 258 31
embassy 0 258 31
should 0 258 31
be 0 258 31
guaranteed 0 258 31
by 0 258 31
the 0 258 31
British 0 258 31
government. 0 258 31

The 0 258 32
United 0 258 32
Nations 0 258 32
Working 0 258 32
Party 0 258 32
on 0 258 32
Unlawful 0 258 32
Detentions 0 258 32
has 0 258 32
made 0 258 32
that 0 258 32
clear. 0 258 32

Britain 0 258 33
took 0 258 33
part 0 258 33
in 0 258 33
an 0 258 33
investigation 0 258 33
which 0 258 33
determined 0 258 33
that 0 258 33
Julian 0 258 33
was 0 258 33
a 0 258 33
political 0 258 33
refugee 0 258 33
and 0 258 33
that 0 258 33
a 1 258 33
great 1 258 33
miscarriage 1 258 33
of 1 258 33
justice 1 258 33
had 0 258 33
been 0 258 33
imposed 0 258 33
on 0 258 33
him. 0 258 33

It 0 258 34
is 0 258 34
very 0 258 34
good 0 258 34
that 0 258 34
you 0 258 34
are 0 258 34
doing 0 258 34
this, 0 258 34
Dennis, 0 258 34
because 0 258 34
even 0 258 34
in 0 258 34
the 0 258 34
media 0 258 34
outside 0 258 34
the 0 258 34
mainstream, 0 258 34
there 0 258 34
is 0 258 34
this 0 258 34
silence 0 258 34
about 0 258 34
Julian. 0 258 34

The 0 258 35
streets 0 258 35
outside 0 258 35
the 0 258 35
embassy 0 258 35
are 1 258 35
virtually 1 258 35
empty, 1 258 35
whereas 0 258 35
they 1 258 35
should 1 258 35
be 1 258 35
full 1 258 35
of 1 258 35
people 1 258 35
saying 1 258 35
that 1 258 35
we 1 258 35
are 1 258 35
with 1 258 35
you. 1 258 35

The 0 258 36
principles 0 258 36
involved 0 258 36
in 0 258 36
this 0 258 36
case 0 258 36
are 0 258 36
absolutely 1 258 36
clear-cut. 1 258 36

Number 0 258 37
one 0 258 37
is 0 258 37
justice. 0 258 37

The 1 258 38
injustice 1 258 38
done 1 258 38
to 1 258 38
this 1 258 38
man 1 258 38
is 1 258 38
legion, 1 258 38
both 0 258 38
in 0 258 38
terms 0 258 38
of 0 258 38
the 1 258 38
bogus 1 258 38
Swedish 1 258 38
case 1 258 38
and 0 258 38
now 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
fact 0 258 38
that 0 258 38
he 0 258 38
must 0 258 38
remain 0 258 38
in 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
embassy 0 258 38
and 0 258 38
can’t 0 258 38
leave 0 258 38
without 0 258 38
being 0 258 38
arrested, 0 258 38
extradited 0 258 38
to 0 258 38
the 0 258 38
United 0 258 38
States 0 258 38
and 0 258 38
ending 1 258 38
up 1 258 38
in 1 258 38
a 1 258 38
hell 1 258 38
hole. 1 258 38

But 1 258 39
it 1 258 39
is 1 258 39
also 1 258 39
about 1 258 39
freedom 1 258 39
of 1 258 39
speech, 1 258 39
about 1 258 39
our 1 258 39
right 1 258 39
to 1 258 39
know, 1 258 39
which 1 258 39
is 1 258 39
enshrined 1 258 39
in 1 258 39
the 1 258 39
United 1 258 39
States 1 258 39
Constitution. 1 258 39

If 0 258 40
the 0 258 40
Constitution 0 258 40
were 0 258 40
taken 0 258 40
literally, 0 258 40
Julian 0 258 40
would 0 258 40
be 0 258 40
a 1 258 40
constitutional 1 258 40
hero, 1 258 40
actually. 0 258 40

Instead, 0 258 41
I 0 258 41
understand 0 258 41
the 0 258 41
indictment 0 258 41
they 0 258 41
are 0 258 41
trying 0 258 41
to 0 258 41
concoct 0 258 41
reads 0 258 41
like 0 258 41
a 0 258 41
charge 0 258 41
of 0 258 41
espionage! 0 258 41

It’s 1 258 42
so 1 258 42
ridiculous.That 1 258 42
is 0 258 42
the 0 258 42
situation 0 258 42
as 0 258 42
I 0 258 42
see 0 258 42
it, 0 258 42
Dennis. 0 258 42

It 0 258 43
is 0 258 43
not 0 258 43
a 0 258 43
happy 0 258 43
one 0 258 43
but 0 258 43
it 0 258 43
is 0 258 43
one 0 258 43
that 0 258 43
people 0 258 43
should 0 258 43
rally 0 258 43
to 0 258 43
quickly. 0 258 43

DB: 0 258 44
His 1 258 44
journalistic 1 258 44
brethren 1 258 44
are 0 258 44
sounding 0 258 44
like 0 258 44
his 0 258 44
prosecutors. 0 258 44

They 0 258 45
want 0 258 45
to 0 258 45
get 0 258 45
behind 0 258 45
Russia-gate 1 258 45
freaks 1 258 45
like 0 258 45
Congressman 0 258 45
Adam 0 258 45
Schiff 0 258 45
and 0 258 45
Mike 0 258 45
Pompeo, 0 258 45
who 0 258 45
would 0 258 45
like 0 258 45
to 0 258 45
see 0 258 45
Assange 0 258 45
in 1 258 45
jail 1 258 45
forever 1 258 45
or 1 258 45
even 1 258 45
executed. 1 258 45

How 0 258 46
do 0 258 46
you 0 258 46
respond 0 258 46
to 0 258 46
journalists 0 258 46
acting 0 258 46
like 0 258 46
prosecutors, 0 258 46
some 0 258 46
of 0 258 46
whom 0 258 46
used 0 258 46
his 0 258 46
material 0 258 46
to 0 258 46
do 0 258 46
stories? 0 258 46

This 0 258 47
is 0 258 47
a 0 258 47
terrible 0 258 47
time 0 258 47
for 0 258 47
journalism. 0 258 47

JP: 0 258 48
You 0 258 48
are 0 258 48
absolutely 0 258 48
right: 0 258 48
It 0 258 48
is 0 258 48
a 0 258 48
terrible 0 258 48
time 0 258 48
for 0 258 48
journalism. 0 258 48

I 1 258 49
have 1 258 49
never 1 258 49
known 1 258 49
anything 1 258 49
quite 1 258 49
like 1 258 49
it 1 258 49
in 1 258 49
my 1 258 49
career. 1 258 49

That 0 258 50
said, 0 258 50
it 0 258 50
is 0 258 50
not 0 258 50
new. 0 258 50

There 0 258 51
has 0 258 51
always 0 258 51
been 0 258 51
a 0 258 51
so-called 0 258 51
mainstream 0 258 51
which 0 258 51
really 0 258 51
comes 0 258 51
down 0 258 51
to 0 258 51
great 0 258 51
power 0 258 51
in 0 258 51
media. 0 258 51

It 0 258 52
has 0 258 52
always 0 258 52
existed, 0 258 52
particularly 0 258 52
in 0 258 52
the 0 258 52
United 0 258 52
States. 0 258 52

The 0 258 53
Pulitzer 0 258 53
Prize 0 258 53
this 0 258 53
year 0 258 53
was 0 258 53
awarded 0 258 53
to 0 258 53
The 0 258 53
New 0 258 53
York 0 258 53
Times 0 258 53
and 0 258 53
The 0 258 53
Washington 0 258 53
Post 0 258 53
for 0 258 53
witch-hunting 1 258 53
around 1 258 53
Russia-gate! 1 258 53

They 0 258 54
were 0 258 54
praised 0 258 54
for 0 258 54
“how 0 258 54
deeply 0 258 54
sourced 0 258 54
their 0 258 54
investigations 0 258 54
were.” 0 258 54
Their 1 258 54
investigations 1 258 54
turned 1 258 54
up 1 258 54
not 1 258 54
a 1 258 54
shred 1 258 54
of 1 258 54
real 1 258 54
evidence 1 258 54
to 0 258 54
suggest 0 258 54
any 0 258 54
serious 0 258 54
Russian 0 258 54
intervention 0 258 54
in 0 258 54
the 0 258 54
2016 0 258 54
election. 0 258 54

Like 0 258 55
Webb 0 258 55

The 0 258 56
Julian 0 258 56
Assange 0 258 56
case 0 258 56
reminds 0 258 56
me 0 258 56
of 0 258 56
the 0 258 56
Gary 0 258 56
Webb 0 258 56
case. 0 258 56

Bob 0 258 57
Parry 0 258 57
was 0 258 57
one 0 258 57
of 0 258 57
Gary 0 258 57
Webb’s 0 258 57
few 0 258 57
supporters 0 258 57
in 0 258 57
the 0 258 57
media. 0 258 57

Webb’s 0 258 58
“Dark 0 258 58
Alliance” 0 258 58
series 0 258 58
contained 0 258 58
evidence 0 258 58
that 0 258 58
cocaine 0 258 58
trafficking 0 258 58
was 0 258 58
going 0 258 58
on 0 258 58
with 0 258 58
the 0 258 58
connivance 0 258 58
of 0 258 58
the 0 258 58
CIA. 0 258 58

Later 0 258 59
Webb 0 258 59
was 1 258 59
hounded 1 258 59
by 0 258 59
fellow 0 258 59
journalists 0 258 59
and, 0 258 59
unable 0 258 59
to 0 258 59
find 0 258 59
work, 0 258 59
he 0 258 59
eventually 0 258 59
committed 0 258 59
suicide. 0 258 59

The 0 258 60
CIA 0 258 60
Inspector 0 258 60
General 0 258 60
subsequently 0 258 60
vindicated 0 258 60
him. 0 258 60

Now, 0 258 61
Julian 0 258 61
Assange 0 258 61
is 0 258 61
a 0 258 61
long 0 258 61
way 0 258 61
from 0 258 61
taking 0 258 61
his 0 258 61
own 0 258 61
life. 0 258 61

His 0 258 62
resilience 0 258 62
is 0 258 62
remarkable. 0 258 62

But 0 258 63
he 0 258 63
is 0 258 63
still 0 258 63
a 0 258 63
human 0 258 63
being 0 258 63
and 0 258 63
he 0 258 63
has 0 258 63
taken 1 258 63
such 1 258 63
a 1 258 63
battering. 1 258 63

Probably 0 258 64
the 0 258 64
hardest 0 258 64
thing 0 258 64
for 0 258 64
him 0 258 64
to 0 258 64
take 0 258 64
is 0 258 64
the 1 258 64
utter 1 258 64
hypocrisy 1 258 64
of 1 258 64
news 1 258 64
organizations—like 1 258 64
The 0 258 64
New 0 258 64
York 0 258 64
Times, 0 258 64
which 0 258 64
published 0 258 64
the 0 258 64
WikiLeaks 0 258 64
“War 0 258 64
Logs” 0 258 64
and 0 258 64
“Cablegate,” 0 258 64
The 0 258 64
Washington 0 258 64
Post 0 258 64
and 0 258 64
The 0 258 64
Guardian, 0 258 64
which 0 258 64
has 0 258 64
taken 0 258 64
a 1 258 64
vindictive 1 258 64
delight 1 258 64
in 1 258 64
tormenting 1 258 64
Julian. 1 258 64

The 0 258 65
Guardian 0 258 65
a 0 258 65
few 0 258 65
years 0 258 65
ago 0 258 65
got 0 258 65
a 0 258 65
Pulitzer 0 258 65
Prize 0 258 65
writing 0 258 65
about 0 258 65
Snowden. 0 258 65

But 0 258 66
their 0 258 66
coverage 0 258 66
of 0 258 66
Snowden 0 258 66
left 0 258 66
him 0 258 66
in 0 258 66
Hong 0 258 66
Kong. 0 258 66

It 0 258 67
was 0 258 67
WikiLeaks 0 258 67
that 0 258 67
got 0 258 67
Snowden 0 258 67
out 0 258 67
of 0 258 67
Hong 0 258 67
Kong 0 258 67
and 0 258 67
to 0 258 67
safety. 0 258 67

Professionally, 0 258 68
I 1 258 68
find 1 258 68
this 1 258 68
one 1 258 68
of 1 258 68
the 1 258 68
most 1 258 68
unsavory 1 258 68
and 1 258 68
immoral 1 258 68
things 1 258 68
I 1 258 68
have 1 258 68
seen 1 258 68
in 1 258 68
my 1 258 68
career. 1 258 68

The 0 258 69
persecution 0 258 69
of 0 258 69
this 0 258 69
man 0 258 69
by 0 258 69
huge 0 258 69
media 0 258 69
organizations 0 258 69
which 0 258 69
have 0 258 69
drawn 0 258 69
great 0 258 69
benefit 0 258 69
from 0 258 69
WikiLeaks. 0 258 69

One 1 258 70
of 1 258 70
Assange’s 1 258 70
great 1 258 70
tormentors, 1 258 70
The 1 258 70
Guardian‘s 1 258 70
Luke 1 258 70
Harding, 1 258 70
made 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
great 0 258 70
deal 0 258 70
of 0 258 70
money 0 258 70
with 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
Hollywood 0 258 70
version 0 258 70
of 0 258 70
a 0 258 70
book 0 258 70
that 0 258 70
he 0 258 70
and 0 258 70
David 0 258 70
Lee 0 258 70
wrote 0 258 70
in 0 258 70
which 0 258 70
they 0 258 70
basically 0 258 70
attacked 0 258 70
their 0 258 70
source. 0 258 70

I 0 258 71
suppose 0 258 71
you 0 258 71
have 0 258 71
to 0 258 71
be 0 258 71
a 0 258 71
psychiatrist 0 258 71
to 0 258 71
understand 0 258 71
all 0 258 71
of 0 258 71
this. 0 258 71

My 0 258 72
understanding 0 258 72
is 0 258 72
that 0 258 72
so 0 258 72
many 0 258 72
of 0 258 72
these 0 258 72
journalists 0 258 72
are 0 258 72
shamed. 0 258 72

They 0 258 73
realize 0 258 73
that 0 258 73
WikiLeaks 0 258 73
has 0 258 73
done 0 258 73
what 0 258 73
they 0 258 73
should 0 258 73
have 0 258 73
done 0 258 73
a 0 258 73
long 0 258 73
time 0 258 73
ago, 0 258 73
and 0 258 73
that 0 258 73
is 0 258 73
to 0 258 73
tell 0 258 73
us 0 258 73
how 0 258 73
governments 0 258 73
lie. 0 258 73

DB: 0 258 74
One 0 258 74
thing 0 258 74
that 0 258 74
disturbs 0 258 74
me 0 258 74
greatly 0 258 74
is 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
way 0 258 74
in 0 258 74
which 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
Western 0 258 74
corporate 0 258 74
press 0 258 74
speculate 0 258 74
about 0 258 74
Russian 0 258 74
involvement 0 258 74
in 0 258 74
the 0 258 74
U.S. 0 258 74
2016 0 258 74
election, 0 258 74
that 0 258 74
it 1 258 74
was 1 258 74
a 1 258 74
hack 1 258 74
through 1 258 74
Julian 1 258 74
Assange. 1 258 74

Any 0 258 75
serious 0 258 75
investigator 0 258 75
would 0 258 75
want 0 258 75
to 0 258 75
know 0 258 75
who 0 258 75
would 0 258 75
be 0 258 75
motivated. 0 258 75

And 0 258 76
yet 0 258 76
the 0 258 76
possibility 0 258 76
that 0 258 76
it 0 258 76
might 0 258 76
be 0 258 76
the 1 258 76
dozen 1 258 76
or 1 258 76
so 1 258 76
pissed-off 1 258 76
people 1 258 76
who 0 258 76
went 0 258 76
to 0 258 76
work 0 258 76
for 0 258 76
the 1 258 76
Clinton 1 258 76
machine 1 258 76
and 0 258 76
learned 0 258 76
from 0 258 76
the 0 258 76
inside 0 258 76
that 0 258 76
the 0 258 76
DNC 0 258 76
was 0 258 76
all 0 258 76
about 0 258 76
getting 0 258 76
rid 0 258 76
of 0 258 76
Bernie 0 258 76
Sanders…this 0 258 76
is 0 258 76
not 0 258 76
a 0 258 76
part 0 258 76
of 0 258 76
the 0 258 76
story! 0 258 76

Eight 0 258 77
Hundred 0 258 77
Thousand 0 258 77
Disclosures 0 258 77
on 0 258 77
Russia 0 258 77

JP: 0 258 78
What 0 258 78
happened 0 258 78
to 0 258 78
Sanders 0 258 78
and 0 258 78
the 0 258 78
way 0 258 78
that 0 258 78
he 1 258 78
was 1 258 78
rolled 1 258 78
by 1 258 78
the 1 258 78
Clinton 1 258 78
organization, 1 258 78
everybody 0 258 78
knows 0 258 78
that 0 258 78
this 0 258 78
is 0 258 78
the 0 258 78
story. 0 258 78

And 0 258 79
now 0 258 79
we 0 258 79
have 0 258 79
the 0 258 79
DNC 0 258 79
suing 0 258 79
WikiLeaks! 0 258 79

There’s 0 258 80
a 0 258 80
kind 0 258 80
of 0 258 80
farcical 1 258 80
element 1 258 80
to 0 258 80
this. 0 258 80

I 0 258 81
mean, 0 258 81
none 0 258 81
of 0 258 81
this 0 258 81
came 0 258 81
from 0 258 81
the 0 258 81
Russians. 0 258 81

That 0 258 82
WikiLeaks 0 258 82
is 0 258 82
somehow 0 258 82
in 1 258 82
bed 1 258 82
with 1 258 82
the 1 258 82
Russians 1 258 82
is 1 258 82
ludicrous. 1 258 82

a 0 258 85
very 0 258 85
high-profile 0 258 85
series 0 258 85
to 0 258 85
the 0 258 85
persecution 0 258 85
of 0 258 85

recently 0 258 85
found 0 258 85
himself 0 258 85

with 0 258 86
Congressman 0 258 86

he 1 258 86
yelled 1 258 86
out 1 258 86
“What 0 258 86
about 0 258 86
Julian 0 258 86

Randy 0 258 86
was 0 258 86
attacked 0 258 86

dragged 0 258 86
out. 0 258 86

It 0 258 87
was 0 258 87
if 0 258 87
everyone 0 258 87
there 0 258 87
was 0 258 87
embarrassed 0 258 87

that 0 258 87
one 1 258 87
of 1 258 87
their 1 258 87
brethren 1 258 87
was 1 258 87

brutalized. 1 258 87

JP: 0 258 88
Randy 0 258 88
shouted 0 258 88
some 0 258 88
truth. 0 258 88

It 0 258 89
is 0 258 89
very 0 258 89
similar 0 258 89
to 0 258 89
what 0 258 89
happened 0 258 89
to 0 258 89
Ray 0 258 89

former 0 258 90
member 0 258 90
of 0 258 90
the 0 258 90
CIA 0 258 90
but 0 258 90
extremely 0 258 90
principled. 0 258 90

I 0 258 91
might 0 258 91
suggest 0 258 91
he 1 258 91
is 1 258 91
a 1 258 91
renegade 1 258 91
now. 0 258 91

It 1 258 92
was 1 258 92
hysterical 1 258 92
to 0 258 92
watch 0 258 92
these 0 258 92
four 0 258 92
armed 0 258 92
guards 0 258 92
who 0 258 92
kept 0 258 92
shouting 0 258 92
“Stop 0 258 92
resisting, 0 258 92
stop 0 258 92
resisting!” 0 258 92
and 0 258 92
they 0 258 92
are 0 258 92
beating 1 258 92
the 1 258 92
hell 1 258 92
out 1 258 92
of 1 258 92
him! 1 258 92

JP: 0 258 93
I 0 258 93
thought 0 258 93
the 0 258 93
image 0 258 93
of 0 258 93
Ray 0 258 93
being 1 258 93
hauled 1 258 93
off 1 258 93
was 0 258 93
particularly 0 258 93
telling. 0 258 93

These 1 258 94
four 1 258 94
overweight, 1 258 94
obviously 1 258 94
ill-trained 1 258 94
young 1 258 94
men 1 258 94
manhandling 1 258 94
Ray, 0 258 94
who 0 258 94
is 0 258 94
78 0 258 94
years 0 258 94
old. 0 258 94

There 0 258 95
was 0 258 95
something 0 258 95
highly 0 258 95
emblematic 0 258 95
about 0 258 95
that 0 258 95
for 0 258 95
me. 0 258 95

He 0 258 96
stood 0 258 96
up 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
challenge 0 258 96
the 0 258 96
fact 0 258 96
that 0 258 96
the 0 258 96
CIA 0 258 96
was 0 258 96
about 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
hand 0 258 96
over 0 258 96
leadership 0 258 96
to 0 258 96
a 0 258 96
person 0 258 96
who 0 258 96
had 0 258 96
been 0 258 96
in 0 258 96
charge 0 258 96
of 0 258 96
torture. 0 258 96

It 0 258 97
is 0 258 97
both 1 258 97
shocking 1 258 97
and 1 258 97
surreal, 1 258 97
which 0 258 97
of 0 258 97
course 0 258 97
the 0 258 97
Julian 0 258 97
Assange 0 258 97
case 0 258 97
is 0 258 97
as 0 258 97
well. 0 258 97

But 0 258 98
real 0 258 98
journalism 0 258 98
should 0 258 98
be 0 258 98
able 0 258 98
to 0 258 98
get 0 258 98
through 0 258 98
the 1 258 98
shocking 1 258 98
and 1 258 98
the 1 258 98
surreal 1 258 98
and 0 258 98
get 0 258 98
to 0 258 98
the 0 258 98
truth. 0 258 98

There 0 258 99
is 0 258 99
so 0 258 99
much 0 258 99
collusion 0 258 99
now, 0 258 99
with 0 258 99
all 0 258 99
these 0 258 99
dark 1 258 99
and 1 258 99
menacing 1 258 99
developments. 1 258 99

It 0 258 100
is 0 258 100
almost 0 258 100
as 0 258 100
if 0 258 100
the 1 258 100
word 1 258 100
“journalism” 1 258 100
is 1 258 100
becoming 1 258 100
blighted. 1 258 100

DB: 0 258 101
There 0 258 101
has 0 258 101
certainly 0 258 101
been 0 258 101
a 0 258 101
lot 0 258 101
of 0 258 101
collusion 0 258 101
when 0 258 101
it 0 258 101
comes 0 258 101
to 0 258 101
Israel. 0 258 101

Then 0 258 102
the 0 258 102
word 0 258 102
“collusion” 0 258 102
is 0 258 102
quite 0 258 102
appropriate. 0 258 102

JP:That’s 0 258 103
the 0 258 103
ultimate 0 258 103
collusion. 0 258 103

But 0 258 104
that’s 0 258 104
collusion 1 258 104
with 0 258 104
silence. 0 258 104

Never 1 258 105
has 1 258 105
there 1 258 105
been 1 258 105
a 1 258 105
collusion 1 258 105
like 1 258 105
the 1 258 105
one 1 258 105
between 1 258 105
the 1 258 105
U.S. 1 258 105
and 1 258 105
Israel. 1 258 105

It 0 258 106
suggests 0 258 106
another 0 258 106
word 0 258 106
and 0 258 106
that 0 258 106
is 0 258 106
“immunity.” 0 258 106
It 0 258 106
has 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
moral 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
cultural 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
geopolitical 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
legal 0 258 106
immunity, 0 258 106

certainly 0 258 106
a 0 258 106
media 0 258 106
immunity. 1 258 106

some 1 258 108
of 1 258 108
the 1 258 108

at 0 258 108
people 0 258 108

were 0 258 108
protesting 0 258 108
the 0 258 108
occupation 0 258 108
of 0 258 108
their 0 258 108
homeland 0 258 108

of 0 258 108

were 0 258 118
times 0 258 118
when 0 258 118
he 0 258 118
could 0 258 118
have 0 258 118
compromised 0 258 118
slightly 0 258 118
in 0 258 118
order 0 258 118
to 0 258 118
possibly 0 258 118
help 0 258 118
his 0 258 118
situation. 0 258 118

There 0 258 119
were 0 258 119
times 0 258 119
when 0 258 119
I 0 258 119
said 0 258 119
to 0 258 119
him, 0 258 119
“Why 0 258 119
don’t 0 258 119
you 0 258 119
just 0 258 119
suspend 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
for 0 258 119
a 0 258 119
while 0 258 119
and 0 258 119
go 0 258 119
along 0 258 119
with 0 258 119
it?” 0 258 119
Of 0 258 119
course, 0 258 119
I 0 258 119
knew 0 258 119
beforehand 0 258 119
what 0 258 119
his 0 258 119
answer 0 258 119
would 0 258 119
be 0 258 119
and 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
was 0 258 119
“no.” 0 258 119
The 0 258 119
enormous 0 258 119
amount 0 258 119
of 0 258 119
information 0 258 119
that 0 258 119
has 0 258 119
come 0 258 119
from 0 258 119
WikiLeaks, 0 258 119
particularly 0 258 119
in 0 258 119
recent 0 258 119
years, 0 258 119
has 0 258 119
amounted 0 258 119
to 0 258 119
an 1 258 119
extraordinary 1 258 119
public 1 258 119
service. 1 258 119

I 0 258 120
was 0 258 120
reading 0 258 120
just 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
other 0 258 120
day 0 258 120
a 0 258 120
2006 0 258 120
WikiLeaks 0 258 120
cable 0 258 120
from 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
U.S. 0 258 120
embassy 0 258 120
in 0 258 120
Caracas 0 258 120
which 0 258 120
was 0 258 120
addressed 0 258 120
to 0 258 120
other 0 258 120
agencies 0 258 120
in 0 258 120
the 0 258 120
region. 0 258 120

This 0 258 121
was 0 258 121
four 0 258 121
years 0 258 121
after 0 258 121
the 0 258 121
U.S. 0 258 121
tried 0 258 121
to 0 258 121
get 0 258 121
rid 0 258 121
of 0 258 121
Chavez 0 258 121
in 0 258 121
a 0 258 121
coup. 0 258 121

It 0 258 122
detailed 0 258 122
how 0 258 122
subversion 0 258 122
should 0 258 122
work. 0 258 122

Of 0 258 123
course, 0 258 123
they 1 258 123
dressed 1 258 123
it 1 258 123
up 1 258 123
as 0 258 123
human 0 258 123
rights 0 258 123
work 0 258 123
and 0 258 123
so 0 258 123
on. 0 258 123

I 0 258 124
was 0 258 124
reading 0 258 124
this 0 258 124
official 0 258 124
document 0 258 124
thinking 0 258 124
how 0 258 124
the 0 258 124
information 0 258 124
contained 0 258 124
in 0 258 124
it 0 258 124
was 0 258 124
worth 0 258 124
years 0 258 124
of 0 258 124
the 0 258 124
kind 0 258 124
of 0 258 124
distorted 0 258 124
reporting 0 258 124
from 0 258 124
Venezuela. 0 258 124

It 0 258 125
also 0 258 125
reminds 0 258 125
us 0 258 125
that 0 258 125
so-called 0 258 125
“meddling” 0 258 125
by 0 258 125
Russia 0 258 125
in 0 258 125
the 0 258 125
U.S. 0 258 125
is 0 258 125
just 0 258 125
nonsense. 0 258 125

The 0 258 126
word 0 258 126
“meddling” 0 258 126
doesn’t 0 258 126
apply 0 258 126
to 0 258 126
the 0 258 126
kind 0 258 126
of 0 258 126
action 0 258 126
implied 0 258 126
in 0 258 126
this 0 258 126
document. 0 258 126

It 0 258 127
is 0 258 127
intervention 0 258 127
in 0 258 127
another 0 258 127
country’s 0 258 127
affairs. 0 258 127

WikiLeaks 0 258 128
has 0 258 128
done 0 258 128
that 0 258 128
all 0 258 128
over 0 258 128
the 0 258 128
world. 0 258 128

It 0 258 129
has 0 258 129
given 0 258 129
people 0 258 129
the 0 258 129
information 0 258 129
they 0 258 129
have 0 258 129
a 0 258 129
right 0 258 129
to 0 258 129
have. 0 258 129

They 0 258 130
had 0 258 130
a 0 258 130
right 0 258 130
to 0 258 130
find 0 258 130
out 0 258 130
from 0 258 130
the 0 258 130
so-called 0 258 130
“War 0 258 130
Logs” 0 258 130
the 0 258 130
criminality 0 258 130
of 0 258 130
our 0 258 130
wars 0 258 130
in 0 258 130
Afghanistan 0 258 130
and 0 258 130
Iraq. 0 258 130

They 1 258 131
had 1 258 131
a 1 258 131
right 1 258 131
to 0 258 131
find 0 258 131
out 0 258 131
about 0 258 131
Cablegate. 0 258 131

That’s 0 258 132
when, 0 258 132
on 0 258 132
Clinton’s 0 258 132
watch, 0 258 132
we 0 258 132
learned 0 258 132
that 0 258 132
the 0 258 132
NSA 0 258 132
was 0 258 132
gathering 0 258 132
personal 0 258 132
information 0 258 132
on 0 258 132
members 0 258 132
of 0 258 132
the 0 258 132
United 0 258 132
Nations 0 258 132
Security 0 258 132
Council, 0 258 132
including 0 258 132
their 0 258 132
credit 0 258 132
card 0 258 132
numbers. 0 258 132

You 0 258 133
can 0 258 133
see 0 258 133
why 0 258 133
Julian 0 258 133
made 0 258 133
enemies. 0 258 133

But 0 258 134
he 0 258 134
should 0 258 134
also 0 258 134
have 0 258 134
made 0 258 134
a 0 258 134
huge 0 258 134
number 0 258 134
of 0 258 134
friends. 0 258 134

This 0 258 135
is 0 258 135
critical 0 258 135
information 0 258 135
because 0 258 135
it 0 258 135
tells 0 258 135
us 0 258 135
how 0 258 135
power 0 258 135
works 0 258 135
and 0 258 135
we 0 258 135
will 0 258 135
never 0 258 135
learn 0 258 135
about 0 258 135
it 0 258 135
otherwise. 0 258 135

I 0 258 136
think 0 258 136
WikiLeaks 0 258 136
has 0 258 136
opened 0 258 136
a 0 258 136
world 0 258 136
of 0 258 136
transparency 0 258 136
and 1 258 136
put 1 258 136
flesh 1 258 136
on 1 258 136
the 1 258 136
expression 1 258 136
“right 0 258 136
to 0 258 136
know.” 0 258 136
This 0 258 136
must 0 258 136
explain 0 258 136
why 0 258 136
he 0 258 136
is 0 258 136
attacked 0 258 136
so 0 258 136
much, 0 258 136
because 0 258 136
that 0 258 136
is 0 258 136
so 0 258 136
threatening. 0 258 136

The 1 258 137
enemy 1 258 137
to 1 258 137
great 1 258 137
power 1 258 137
is 1 258 137
not 1 258 137
the 1 258 137
likes 1 258 137
of 1 258 137
the 1 258 137
Taliban, 1 258 137
it 1 258 137
is 1 258 137
us. 1 258 137

DB: 0 258 138
And 0 258 138
who 0 258 138
can 0 258 138
forget 0 258 138
the 0 258 138
release 0 258 138
of 0 258 138
the 0 258 138
“collateral 0 258 138
murder” 0 258 138
footage 0 258 138
by 0 258 138
Chelsea 0 258 138
Manning? 0 258 138

JP: 0 258 139
That 0 258 139
kind 0 258 139
of 0 258 139
thing 0 258 139
is 0 258 139
not 0 258 139
uncommon. 0 258 139

Vietnam 0 258 140
was 0 258 140
meant 0 258 140
to 0 258 140
be 0 258 140
the 0 258 140
open 0 258 140
war 0 258 140
but 0 258 140
really 0 258 140
it 0 258 140
wasn’t. 0 258 140

There 0 258 141
weren’t 0 258 141
the 0 258 141
cameras 0 258 141
around. 0 258 141

It 0 258 142
is 0 258 142
indeed 0 258 142
shocking 1 258 142
information 1 258 142
but 0 258 142
it 0 258 142
informs 0 258 142
people, 0 258 142
and 0 258 142
we 0 258 142
have 0 258 142
Chelsea 0 258 142
Manning’s 0 258 142
courage 0 258 142
to 0 258 142
thank 0 258 142
for 0 258 142
that. 0 258 142

DB: 0 258 143
Yes, 0 258 143
and 0 258 143
the 0 258 143
thanks 0 258 143
he 0 258 143
got 0 258 143
was 0 258 143
seven 0 258 143
years 0 258 143
in 0 258 143
solitary 0 258 143
confinement. 0 258 143

They 0 258 144
want 0 258 144
to 0 258 144
prosecute 0 258 144
Assange 0 258 144
and 0 258 144
maybe 0 258 144
hang 1 258 144
him 1 258 144
from 1 258 144
the 1 258 144
rafters 1 258 144
in 0 258 144
Congress, 0 258 144

what 1 258 144
about 1 258 144

There 0 258 145
is 0 258 145
no 0 258 145
end 0 258 145
of 0 258 145
horrific 1 258 145
examples 1 258 145
of 0 258 145
what 0 258 145
passes 0 258 145
for 0 258 145

in 0 258 145
contrast 0 258 145
to 0 258 145
the 0 258 145
amazing 0 258 145
contribution 0 258 145
that 0 258 145
Julian 0 258 145

Geert 0 259 1
Wilders 0 259 1
spoke 0 259 1
at 0 259 1
a 0 259 1
massive 0 259 1
rally 0 259 1
for 0 259 1
Tommy 0 259 1
Robinson 0 259 1
on 0 259 1
Saturday. 0 259 1

20,000 0 259 2
people 0 259 2
came 0 259 2
out 0 259 2
to 0 259 2
call 0 259 2
for 0 259 2
Tommy’s 0 259 2
release, 0 259 2
and 0 259 2
Wilders 0 259 2
took 0 259 2
the 0 259 2
opportunity 0 259 2
to 0 259 2
put 0 259 2
the 0 259 2
political 0 259 2
elites 0 259 2
of 0 259 2
Britain 0 259 2
and 0 259 2
continental 0 259 2
Europe 0 259 2
on 0 259 2
notice. 0 259 2

“Our 1 259 3
governments,” 1 259 3
Wilders 0 259 3
declared, 0 259 3
“sold 0 259 3
us 0 259 3
out 0 259 3
with 0 259 3
mass 0 259 3
immigration. 0 259 3

With 0 259 4
Islamization. 0 259 4

With 0 259 5
open 0 259 5
borders. 0 259 5

We 0 259 6
are 0 259 6
almost 0 259 6
foreigners 0 259 6
in 0 259 6
our 0 259 6
own 0 259 6
lands. 0 259 6

And 0 259 7
if 0 259 7
we 0 259 7
complain 0 259 7
about 0 259 7
it, 0 259 7
they 0 259 7
call 0 259 7
us 0 259 7
racists 1 259 7
and 1 259 7
Islamophobes. 1 259 7

But 0 259 8
I 0 259 8
say, 0 259 8
no 1 259 8
more! 1 259 8

And 0 259 9
what 0 259 9
do 0 259 9
you 0 259 9
say? 0 259 9

No 1 259 10
more! 1 259 10

And 0 259 11
that’s 0 259 11
right: 0 259 11
enough 0 259 11
is 0 259 11
enough. 0 259 11

We 0 259 12
will 0 259 12
not 0 259 12
be 0 259 12
gagged 0 259 12
anymore. 0 259 12

No 1 259 13
more 1 259 13
tyranny.” 1 259 13

It 0 259 14
was 0 259 14
extraordinary 0 259 14
that 0 259 14
the 0 259 14
British 0 259 14
authorities 0 259 14
allowed 0 259 14
Wilders 0 259 14
into 0 259 14
the 0 259 14
country 0 259 14
at 0 259 14
all. 0 259 14

Several 0 259 15
years 0 259 15
ago 0 259 15
he 0 259 15
was 0 259 15
banned 0 259 15
from 0 259 15
entering 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
country, 0 259 15
but 0 259 15
although 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
ban 0 259 15
was 0 259 15
reversed 0 259 15
on 0 259 15
appeal, 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
British 0 259 15
government 0 259 15
recently 0 259 15
banned 0 259 15
Martin 0 259 15
Sellner, 0 259 15
Brittany 0 259 15
Pettibone, 0 259 15
Lauren 0 259 15
Southern 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
Lutz 0 259 15
Bachmann 0 259 15
from 0 259 15
entering, 0 259 15
all 0 259 15
for 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
crime 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
opposing 0 259 15
jihad 0 259 15
terror 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
Sharia 0 259 15
oppression, 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
thereby 0 259 15
made 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
clear 0 259 15
that 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
is 0 259 15
more 0 259 15
authoritarian 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
unwilling 0 259 15
to 0 259 15
uphold 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
freedom 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
speech 0 259 15
than 0 259 15
ever 0 259 15
– 0 259 15
at 0 259 15
least 0 259 15
when 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
comes 0 259 15
to 0 259 15
criticism 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
Islam, 0 259 15
Muslim 1 259 15
rape 1 259 15
gangs, 1 259 15
and 0 259 15
mass 0 259 15
Muslim 0 259 15
migration. 0 259 15

Even 0 259 16
worse, 0 259 16
the 0 259 16
bannings 0 259 16
of 0 259 16
Sellner, 0 259 16
Pettibone, 0 259 16
Southern, 0 259 16
and 0 259 16
Bachmann 0 259 16
were 0 259 16
just 0 259 16
part 0 259 16
of 0 259 16
a 0 259 16
long 0 259 16
pattern. 0 259 16

Pamela 0 259 17
Geller 0 259 17
and 0 259 17
I 0 259 17
were 0 259 17
banned 0 259 17
from 0 259 17
entering 0 259 17
Britain 0 259 17
in 0 259 17
2013, 0 259 17
apparently 0 259 17
for 0 259 17
life, 0 259 17
also 0 259 17
for 0 259 17
the 0 259 17
crime 0 259 17
of 0 259 17
telling 0 259 17
the 1 259 17
truth 1 259 17
about 1 259 17
Islam 1 259 17
and 1 259 17
jihad. 1 259 17

Meanwhile, 0 259 18
Britain 0 259 18
has 0 259 18
a 0 259 18
steadily 0 259 18
lengthening 0 259 18
record 0 259 18
of 0 259 18
admitting 0 259 18
jihad 0 259 18
preachers 0 259 18
without 1 259 18
a 1 259 18
moment 1 259 18
of 1 259 18
hesitation. 1 259 18

Syed 0 259 19
Muzaffar 0 259 19
Shah 0 259 19
Qadri’s 0 259 19
preaching 1 259 19
of 1 259 19
hatred 1 259 19
and 1 259 19
jihad 1 259 19
violence 1 259 19
was 0 259 19
so 0 259 19
hardline 1 259 19
that 0 259 19
he 0 259 19
was 0 259 19
banned 0 259 19
from 0 259 19
preaching 0 259 19
in 0 259 19
Pakistan, 0 259 19
but 0 259 19
the 0 259 19
UK 0 259 19
Home 0 259 19
Office 0 259 19
welcomed 0 259 19
him 0 259 19
into 0 259 19
Britain. 0 259 19

The 0 259 20
UK 0 259 20
Home 0 259 20
Office 0 259 20
also 0 259 20
admitted 0 259 20
Shaykh 0 259 20
Hamza 0 259 20
Sodagar 0 259 20
into 0 259 20
the 0 259 20
country, 0 259 20
despite 0 259 20
the 0 259 20
fact 0 259 20
that 0 259 20
he 0 259 20
has 0 259 20
said: 0 259 20
“If 0 259 20
there’s 0 259 20
homosexual 0 259 20
men, 0 259 20
the 0 259 20
punishment 0 259 20
is 0 259 20
one 0 259 20
of 0 259 20
five 0 259 20
things. 0 259 20

One 0 259 21
– 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
easiest 0 259 21
one 0 259 21
maybe 0 259 21
– 0 259 21
chop 0 259 21
their 0 259 21
head 0 259 21
off, 0 259 21
that’s 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
easiest. 0 259 21

Second 0 259 22
– 0 259 22
burn 0 259 22
them 0 259 22
to 0 259 22
death. 0 259 22

Third 0 259 23
– 0 259 23
throw 0 259 23
’em 0 259 23
off 0 259 23
a 0 259 23
cliff. 0 259 23

Fourth 0 259 24
– 0 259 24
tear 0 259 24
down 0 259 24
a 0 259 24
wall 0 259 24
on 0 259 24
them 0 259 24
so 0 259 24
they 0 259 24
die 0 259 24
under 0 259 24
that. 0 259 24

Fifth 0 259 25
– 0 259 25
a 0 259 25
combination 0 259 25
of 0 259 25
the 0 259 25
above.” 0 259 25

Theresa 0 259 26
May’s 0 259 26
relentlessly 1 259 26
appeasement-minded 1 259 26
government 0 259 26
also 0 259 26
admitted 0 259 26
two 0 259 26
jihad 0 259 26
preachers 0 259 26
who 0 259 26
had 0 259 26
praised 0 259 26
the 0 259 26
murderer 0 259 26
of 0 259 26
a 0 259 26
foe 0 259 26
of 0 259 26
Pakistan’s 0 259 26
blasphemy 0 259 26
laws. 0 259 26

One 0 259 27
of 0 259 27
them 0 259 27
was 0 259 27
welcomed 0 259 27
by 0 259 27
the 0 259 27
Archbishop 0 259 27
of 0 259 27
Canterbury. 0 259 27

Meanwhile, 0 259 28
the 0 259 28
UK 0 259 28
banned 0 259 28
three 0 259 28
bishops 0 259 28
from 0 259 28
areas 0 259 28
of 0 259 28
Iraq 0 259 28
and 0 259 28
Syria 0 259 28
where 0 259 28
Christians 0 259 28
are 0 259 28
persecuted 0 259 28
from 0 259 28
entering 0 259 28
the 0 259 28
country. 0 259 28

But 0 259 29
now 0 259 29
matters 0 259 29
are 0 259 29
coming 0 259 29
to 0 259 29
a 0 259 29
head. 0 259 29

Apparently 0 259 30
British 0 259 30
authorities 0 259 30
decided 0 259 30
that 0 259 30
it 0 259 30
would 0 259 30
be 0 259 30
too 0 259 30
politically 0 259 30
costly 0 259 30
for 0 259 30
them 0 259 30
to 0 259 30
bar 0 259 30
Wilders 0 259 30
again. 0 259 30

And 0 259 31
so 0 259 31
he 0 259 31
entered, 0 259 31
and 0 259 31
spoke, 0 259 31
and 0 259 31
gave 0 259 31
them 0 259 31
a 0 259 31
strong 0 259 31
dose 0 259 31
of 0 259 31
the 0 259 31
reality 1 259 31
that 0 259 31
they 0 259 31
are 0 259 31
determined 0 259 31
to 0 259 31
ignore 0 259 31
and 0 259 31
deny. 0 259 31

Tommy 0 259 32
Robinson 0 259 32
is 0 259 32
in 0 259 32
prison 0 259 32
today 0 259 32
because 0 259 32
he 0 259 32
violated 0 259 32
a 0 259 32
court 0 259 32
order 0 259 32
demanding 0 259 32
that 0 259 32
he 0 259 32
not 0 259 32
film 0 259 32
videos 0 259 32
outside 0 259 32
the 0 259 32
trials 0 259 32
of 0 259 32
Muslim 1 259 32
rape 1 259 32
gangs. 1 259 32

Clearly 0 259 33
the 1 259 33
government’s 1 259 33
intent 1 259 33
was 1 259 33
to 1 259 33
make 1 259 33
sure 1 259 33
that 1 259 33
as 1 259 33
few 1 259 33
people 1 259 33
as 1 259 33
possible 1 259 33
discovered 1 259 33
the 1 259 33
truth 1 259 33
about 0 259 33
its 0 259 33
massive, 0 259 33
years-long 0 259 33
cover-up 0 259 33
of 0 259 33
those 0 259 33
rape 1 259 33
gangs, 1 259 33
and 0 259 33
refusal 0 259 33
to 0 259 33
prosecute 0 259 33
the 0 259 33
perpetrators. 0 259 33

Theresa 0 259 34
May 0 259 34
and 0 259 34
company 0 259 34
obvious 0 259 34
hope 0 259 34
that 0 259 34
other 0 259 34
Britons 0 259 34
who 0 259 34
are 0 259 34
furious 0 259 34
about 0 259 34
the 0 259 34
sacrifice 1 259 34
of 1 259 34
thousands 1 259 34
of 0 259 34
British 1 259 34
girls 1 259 34
to 0 259 34
the 0 259 34
idols 0 259 34
of 0 259 34
“diversity” 0 259 34
and 0 259 34
“multiculturalism” 0 259 34
will 0 259 34
see 0 259 34
what 0 259 34
happened 0 259 34
to 0 259 34
Tommy, 0 259 34
and 0 259 34
be 0 259 34
frightened 0 259 34
into 0 259 34
silence. 0 259 34

The 0 259 35
British 0 259 35
government, 0 259 35
in 0 259 35
imprisoning 0 259 35
Tommy 0 259 35
Robinson, 0 259 35
has 0 259 35
shown 0 259 35
itself 0 259 35
willing 0 259 35
to 0 259 35
incarcerate 0 259 35
people 0 259 35
for 0 259 35
having 0 259 35
opinions 0 259 35
that 0 259 35
it 0 259 35
considers 0 259 35
unacceptable. 0 259 35

That 0 259 36
heralds 0 259 36
the 1 259 36
death 1 259 36
of 1 259 36
Britain 1 259 36
as 1 259 36
a 1 259 36
free 1 259 36
society 1 259 36
and 0 259 36
the 0 259 36
beginning 1 259 36
of 1 259 36
an 1 259 36
authoritarian 1 259 36
police 1 259 36
state 1 259 36
there, 0 259 36
unless 1 259 36
this 1 259 36
slide 1 259 36
to 1 259 36
totalitarianism 1 259 36
is 1 259 36
stopped 1 259 36
now. 1 259 36

British 0 259 37
public 0 259 37
figures, 0 259 37
whatever 0 259 37
criticism 0 259 37
they 0 259 37
have 0 259 37
leveled 0 259 37
against 0 259 37
Tommy 0 259 37
Robinson 0 259 37
in 0 259 37
the 0 259 37
past, 0 259 37
should 0 259 37
be 0 259 37
calling 0 259 37
for 0 259 37
him 0 259 37
to 0 259 37
be 0 259 37
freed 0 259 37
today, 0 259 37
or 1 259 37
else 1 259 37
they 1 259 37
will 1 259 37
be 1 259 37
exposing 1 259 37
themselves 1 259 37
as 1 259 37
supporting 1 259 37
the 1 259 37
degeneration 1 259 37
of 1 259 37
Britain 1 259 37
into 0 259 37
a 0 259 37
police 0 259 37
state. 0 259 37

Wilders 0 259 38
addressed 0 259 38
this 0 259 38
endeavor 0 259 38
head-on, 0 259 38
declaring: 0 259 38
“We 1 259 38
will 1 259 38
not 1 259 38
be 1 259 38
silenced. 1 259 38

We 1 259 39
will 1 259 39
not 1 259 39
be 1 259 39
intimidated. 1 259 39

And 1 259 40
we 1 259 40
tell 1 259 40
the 1 259 40
governments, 1 259 40
we 1 259 40
are 1 259 40
not 1 259 40
afraid 1 259 40
of 1 259 40
you. 1 259 40

We 1 259 41
will 1 259 41
never 1 259 41
surrender. 1 259 41

We 1 259 42
will 1 259 42
stand 1 259 42
strong 1 259 42
and 1 259 42
do 1 259 42
our 1 259 42
duty. 1 259 42

We 1 259 43
will 1 259 43
defend 1 259 43
our 1 259 43
civilization. 1 259 43

And 1 259 44
we 1 259 44
will 1 259 44
protect 1 259 44
our 1 259 44
people.” 1 259 44

Wilders 0 259 45
added: 0 259 45
“And 0 259 45
I 0 259 45
tell 0 259 45
you, 0 259 45
to 0 259 45
the 0 259 45
governments. 0 259 45

You 0 259 46
can 0 259 46
throw 0 259 46
us 0 259 46
in 0 259 46
jail, 0 259 46
but 0 259 46
you 0 259 46
will 0 259 46
never 0 259 46
defeat 0 259 46
us. 0 259 46

Because, 0 259 47
my 0 259 47
friends, 0 259 47
for 0 259 47
every 0 259 47
Tommy 0 259 47
whom 0 259 47
you 0 259 47
imprison, 0 259 47
thousands 0 259 47
will 0 259 47
rise 0 259 47
up. 0 259 47

So 0 259 48
take 1 259 48
notice, 1 259 48
Theresa 0 259 48
May. 0 259 48

Take 1 259 49
notice, 1 259 49
Dutch 0 259 49
Prime 0 259 49
Minister 0 259 49
Rutte. 0 259 49

Take 1 259 50
notice, 1 259 50
Mrs. 0 259 50
Merkel 0 259 50
or 0 259 50
President 0 259 50
Macron. 0 259 50

Take 1 259 51
notice: 1 259 51
the 1 259 51
future 1 259 51
is 1 259 51
ours 1 259 51
and 1 259 51
not 1 259 51
yours. 1 259 51

We 0 259 52
will 0 259 52
defeat 0 259 52
you 0 259 52
politically, 0 259 52
because 0 259 52
we, 0 259 52
my 0 259 52
friends, 0 259 52
we 1 259 52
are 1 259 52
the 1 259 52
people.” 1 259 52

If 1 259 53
Wilders’ 1 259 53
words 1 259 53
don’t 1 259 53
prove 1 259 53
true, 1 259 53
it 1 259 53
will 1 259 53
be 1 259 53
because 1 259 53
the 1 259 53
death 1 259 53
of 1 259 53
free 1 259 53
societies 1 259 53
in 1 259 53
Britain 1 259 53
and 1 259 53
Western 1 259 53
Europe 1 259 53
is 1 259 53
truly 1 259 53
at 1 259 53
hand. 1 259 53

“And 0 260 44
why 1 260 44

asked. 0 260 51

Well, 0 260 52
the 0 260 52
questions 0 260 52
are 0 260 52
obviously 0 260 52
rhetorical. 0 260 52

We 0 260 53
know 0 260 53
why. 0 260 53

The 0 260 54
UK 0 260 54
is 0 260 54
frightened 0 260 54
of 0 260 54
the 0 260 54

and 0 260 54
by 0 260 54

they 0 260 54
are 0 260 54

complicit 0 260 54
in 0 260 54
the 0 260 54

Kassam 0 260 58
also 0 260 58
spoke 0 260 58
at 0 260 58
the 0 260 58
event, 0 260 58
reminding 0 260 58
supporters 0 260 58
of 0 260 58
what 0 260 58
was 0 260 58
happening 0 260 58
all 0 260 58
across 0 260 58
Europe 0 260 58
due 0 260 58
the 0 260 58
mass 0 260 58
influx 0 260 58
of 0 260 58
Muslim 0 260 58
migrants. 0 260 58

Then 0 260 59
he 0 260 59
encouraged 0 260 59
them 0 260 59
with 0 260 59
a 0 260 59
piece 0 260 59
of 0 260 59
American 0 260 59
history. 0 260 59

“I’m 0 260 60
sure 0 260 60
we 0 260 60
have 0 260 60
some 0 260 60
American 1 260 60
friends 1 260 60
in 0 260 60
the 0 260 60
crowd, 0 260 60
on 0 260 60
stage, 0 260 60
and 0 260 60
watching 0 260 60
at 0 260 60
home,” 0 260 60
Kassam 0 260 60
concluded. 0 260 60

“You 0 260 61
know 0 260 61
there 0 260 61
was 0 260 61
a 0 260 61
man 0 260 61
called 0 260 61
Paul 0 260 61
Revere. 0 260 61

He 0 260 62
rode 0 260 62
through 0 260 62
the 0 260 62
night 0 260 62
on 0 260 62
his 0 260 62
horse. 0 260 62

He 0 260 63
said, 0 260 63
‘The 0 260 63
British 0 260 63
are 0 260 63
coming, 0 260 63
the 0 260 63
British 0 260 63
are 0 260 63
coming!’ 0 260 63
Well, 0 260 63
let 0 260 63
you 0 260 63
tell 0 260 63
you 0 260 63
something; 0 260 63
we’re 0 260 63
here 0 260 63
today 0 260 63
to 0 260 63
say 0 260 63
a 0 260 63
similar 0 260 63
thing: 0 260 63
The 1 260 63
British 1 260 63
are 1 260 63
coming 1 260 63
back!” 1 260 63

I 0 260 64
do 0 260 64
hope 0 260 64
that 0 260 64
is 0 260 64
true, 0 260 64
but 0 260 64
unless 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
Brits 0 260 64
are 0 260 64
going 0 260 64
to 0 260 64
put 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
same 0 260 64
kind 0 260 64
of 0 260 64
fear 0 260 64
in 0 260 64
their 0 260 64
representatives 0 260 64
that 0 260 64
the 0 260 64
Muslims 0 260 64
are 0 260 64
doing, 0 260 64
they 0 260 64
can't 0 260 64
expect 0 260 64
to 0 260 64
do 0 260 64
what 0 260 64
they 0 260 64
want 0 260 64
to 0 260 64
do. 0 260 64

What 0 260 65
Britain 0 260 65
needs 0 260 65
is 0 260 65
a 0 260 65
return 0 260 65
to 0 260 65
the 1 260 65
God 1 260 65
of 1 260 65
their 1 260 65
forefathers, 1 260 65
the 0 260 65
One 0 260 65
Oliver 0 260 65
Cromwell 0 260 65
served. 0 260 65

They 0 260 66
need 0 260 66
to 0 260 66
fear 0 260 66
Him 0 260 66
more 0 260 66
than 0 260 66
they 0 260 66
do 0 260 66
the 0 260 66
Islamic 0 260 66
terrorists 0 260 66
and 0 260 66
rape 0 260 66
gangs. 0 260 66

Then, 1 260 67
and 1 260 67
only 1 260 67
then, 1 260 67
will 0 260 67
they 0 260 67
render 0 260 67
justice 0 260 67
for 0 260 67
the 0 260 67

— 0 261 8
the 0 261 8
revolution 1 261 8

again, 0 261 9
it’s 0 261 9

We 0 261 14

The 0 261 14
Remnant 0 261 14

promote 0 261 14
the 0 261 14

and 0 261 14
this 0 261 14
report 0 261 14
helps 0 261 14
illustrate 0 261 14
why. 0 261 14

At 0 261 15
the 0 261 15
moment 0 261 15
and 0 261 15
personally 0 261 15

my 0 261 15

We 0 261 16

and 0 261 16
three 0 261 16
in 0 261 16

Our 0 261 17
family 0 261 17
couldn't 1 261 17
be 1 261 17
happier 1 261 17
with 0 261 17

I 0 261 24
realize 0 261 24
it’s 0 261 24

few 0 261 24

greater 0 261 24

that? 0 264 40

IG 0 264 41

can’t 0 264 41

it, 0 264 41

he’s 0 264 41

that 0 264 41

How 1 264 42
in 1 264 42
the 1 264 42

can 1 264 42
we 1 264 42
trust 1 264 42
them 1 264 42
even 0 264 42

they 0 264 42

We 0 264 43
see 0 264 43
this 0 264 43
kind 0 264 43
of 0 264 43
corruption 0 264 43
all 0 264 43
over 0 264 43
the 0 264 43
world, 0 264 43
why 0 264 43
should 0 264 43
believe 0 264 43
that 0 264 43
these 0 264 43
officials 0 264 43
could 0 264 43
be 0 264 43
immune 0 264 43
to 0 264 43
acting 0 264 43
on 0 264 43
their 0 264 43
personal 0 264 43

There 0 264 44
were 0 264 44
7 0 264 44
of 0 264 44
them 0 264 44
on 0 264 44
the 0 264 44
case, 0 264 44
and 0 264 44
they 0 264 44
were 0 264 44
comfortable 0 264 44
enough 0 264 44
with 0 264 44
each 0 264 44
other 0 264 44
to 0 264 44
express 0 264 44

none 0 264 44
of 0 264 44
them 0 264 44
ever 0 264 44
chastised 0 264 44
the 0 264 44
others 0 264 44
for 0 264 44
expressing 0 264 44
those 0 264 44
biases! 0 264 44

Not 0 264 45
only 0 264 45
that, 0 264 45
the 0 264 45
team 0 264 45
that 0 264 45
handled 0 264 45
Clinton’s 0 264 45
investigation 0 264 45
so 0 264 45
poorly 0 264 45
was 0 264 45
almost 0 264 45
the 0 264 45
identical 0 264 45

assigned 0 264 45
to 0 264 45
handle 0 264 45
the 0 264 45
Russia 0 264 45
investigation! 0 264 45

Meaning, 0 264 46
the 0 264 46
obviously 0 264 46
politically 0 264 46
biased 0 264 46
team 0 264 46
that 0 264 46
had 0 264 46
just 0 264 46
cleared 0 264 46
the 0 264 46
woman 0 264 46
that 0 264 46
they 0 264 46
supported, 0 264 46
was 0 264 46
now 0 264 46
tapped 0 264 46
to 0 264 46

the 0 264 46
man 0 264 46
that 0 264 46
they 0 264 46
hated 0 264 46
was 0 264 46
tied 0 264 46
to 0 264 46

corruption. 0 264 46

In 0 264 60

you 0 264 60
can 0 264 60
already 0 264 60

the 0 264 60

of 0 264 60
the 0 264 60

the 0 264 60

Strzok 0 264 61
writes 0 264 61
that 0 264 61
the 0 264 61
media 0 264 61
has 0 264 61
been 0 264 61
focused 0 264 61
on 0 264 61
the 0 264 61
question 0 264 61
of 0 264 61
why 0 264 61
Hillary 0 264 61
seems 0 264 61
to 0 264 61
be 0 264 61
getting 0 264 61
a 0 264 61
pass 0 264 61
when 0 264 61
“Petraeus/Berger/Libby” 0 264 61
did 0 264 61
not. 0 264 61

He 0 264 62
writes, 0 264 62
“We 0 264 62
draw 0 264 62
the 0 264 62
distinction 0 264 62
in 0 264 62
noting 0 264 62
we 0 264 62
have 0 264 62
no 0 264 62

was 0 264 62
ever 0 264 62
shared 0 264 62
with 0 264 62
an 0 264 62
unauthorized 0 264 62
party, 0 264 62
i.e. 0 264 62

notwithstanding 0 264 63
the 0 264 63
server 0 264 63
setup, 0 264 63
we 0 264 63
have 0 264 63
not 0 264 63
seen 0 264 63
classified 0 264 63
information 0 264 63
shared 0 264 63
with 0 264 63
a 0 264 63
member 0 264 63
of 0 264 63
the 0 264 63

an 0 264 63
agent 0 264 63
of 0 264 63
a 0 264 63
foreign 0 264 63

a 0 264 63
lover, 0 264 63
etc.” 0 264 63
In 0 264 63
other 0 264 63
words, 0 264 63
Hillary 0 264 63
may 0 264 63
have 0 264 63
been 0 264 63
hacked 0 264 63
but 0 264 63
she 0 264 63
didn’t 0 264 63
intentionally 0 264 63
give 0 264 63
anything 0 264 63
away. 0 264 63

Of 0 264 64
course, 0 264 64
the 0 264 64
statute 0 264 64
itself 0 264 64
didn’t 0 264 64
make 0 264 64
intent 0 264 64
a 0 264 64
prerequisite. 0 264 64

Herridge 0 264 65
reports 0 264 65
that 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
House 0 264 65
committee 0 264 65
memo 0 264 65
once 0 264 65
again 0 264 65
raises 0 264 65
this 0 264 65
same 0 264 65
issue: 0 264 65
“Officials 0 264 65
from 0 264 65
both 0 264 65
agencies 0 264 65
have 0 264 65

they 0 264 65
misinterpreted 0 264 65
the 0 264 65

Act 0 264 65
by 0 264 65
stating 0 264 65

lacked 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
requisite 0 264 65
‘intent’ 0 264 65
for 0 264 65
charges 0 264 65
to 0 264 65
be 0 264 65
filed,” 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
memo 0 264 65
says, 0 264 65
before 0 264 65
pointing 0 264 65
to 0 264 65
statements 0 264 65
by 0 264 65
Comey 0 264 65
that 0 264 65
indicated 0 264 65
a 0 264 65
belief 0 264 65
that 0 264 65
intent 0 264 65
was 0 264 65
required 0 264 65
— 0 264 65
which 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
memo 0 264 65
says 0 264 65
ignored 0 264 65
“meaningful 0 264 65
aspects” 0 264 65
of 0 264 65
the 0 264 65
law. 0 264 65

It 0 264 66
really 0 264 66
does 0 264 66
seem 0 264 66
that 0 264 66
Strzok, 0 264 66
an 0 264 66
agent 0 264 66
who 0 264 66
had 0 264 66
a 0 264 66
personal 0 264 66
pro-Hillary 0 264 66
bias, 0 264 66
was 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
person 0 264 66
who 0 264 66
pushed 0 264 66
to 0 264 66
let 0 264 66
her 0 264 66
off 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
hook 0 264 66
by 0 264 66
focusing 0 264 66
on 0 264 66
her 0 264 66
intent 0 264 66
rather 0 264 66
than 0 264 66
her 0 264 66
negligence 0 264 66
setting 0 264 66
up 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
server 0 264 66
in 0 264 66
the 0 264 66
first 0 264 66
place. 0 264 66

I 1 264 67
fully 1 264 67
believe 1 264 67
IG 1 264 67
Horowitz’ 1 264 67
findings 1 264 67
here. 0 264 67

I 0 264 68
believe 0 264 68
that 0 264 68
he 0 264 68
was 0 264 68
unable 0 264 68
to 0 264 68
prove 0 264 68
that 0 264 68
there 0 264 68
was 0 264 68
any 0 264 68
political 0 264 68
motive 0 264 68
to 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
FBI’s 0 264 68
handling 0 264 68
of 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
Clinton 0 264 68
email 0 264 68
case, 0 264 68
and 0 264 68
I 0 264 68
believe 0 264 68
that 0 264 68
while 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
case 0 264 68
was 0 264 68
obviously 0 264 68
mishandled, 1 264 68
it 0 264 68
could 0 264 68
have 0 264 68
reached 0 264 68
the 0 264 68
conclusion 0 264 68
it 0 264 68
did 0 264 68
honorably. 0 264 68

However, 0 264 69
I 0 264 69
also 0 264 69
think 0 264 69
that 0 264 69
the 0 264 69
IG 0 264 69
has 0 264 69
purposely 0 264 69
left 0 264 69
room 0 264 69
in 0 264 69
his 0 264 69
conclusion 0 264 69
to 0 264 69
amend 0 264 69
that 0 264 69
decision 0 264 69
after 0 264 69
he’s 0 264 69
concluded 0 264 69
his 0 264 69
Russia 0 264 69
investigation. 0 264 69

In 0 264 70
fact, 0 264 70
there 0 264 70
are 0 264 70
already 0 264 70
signs 0 264 70
of 0 264 70
him 0 264 70
doing 0 264 70
that 0 264 70
in 0 264 70
this 0 264 70
report. 0 264 70

Much 0 264 71
of 0 264 71
the 0 264 71
information 0 264 71
that 0 264 71
he 0 264 71
uses 0 264 71
to 0 264 71
chastise 0 264 71
Strzok’s 0 264 71
behavior 0 264 71
and 0 264 71
judgment 0 264 71
in 0 264 71
the 0 264 71
Clinton 0 264 71
email 0 264 71
case, 0 264 71
would 0 264 71
have 0 264 71
actually 0 264 71
come 0 264 71
from 0 264 71
his 0 264 71
current 0 264 71
investigation 0 264 71
into 0 264 71
the 0 264 71
Russia 0 264 71
mess. 0 264 71

It’s 0 264 72
quite 0 264 72
possible 0 264 72
that 0 264 72
as 0 264 72
bad 0 264 72
as 0 264 72
this 0 264 72
report 0 264 72
is 0 264 72
for 0 264 72
Comey, 0 264 72
Strzok, 0 264 72
Page, 0 264 72
and 0 264 72
Obama’s 0 264 72
FBI 0 264 72
leadership… 0 264 72
Horowitz’ 0 264 72
conclusion 0 264 72
in 0 264 72
the 0 264 72
Russia 0 264 72
investigation 0 264 72
could 0 264 72
prove 0 264 72
to 0 264 72
be 0 264 72
even 1 264 72
worse. 1 264 72

did 0 265 3
the 0 265 3
scripture 0 265 3
of 0 265 3
Islam 0 265 3

the 1 265 3
duty 1 265 3
to 1 265 3
kill 1 265 3

are 0 265 4
sure 0 265 4
it 0 265 4
is 0 265 4
there, 0 265 4
though 0 265 4
it 0 265 4
isn’t. 0 265 4

Then 0 265 5
what 0 265 5
does 0 265 5
it 0 265 5
say 0 265 5
about 0 265 5

Not 0 265 6
a 0 265 6
thing 0 265 6

That 1 265 7
would 1 265 7
be 1 265 7
good 1 265 7
to 1 265 7
know, 1 265 7
were 1 265 7
Wills 1 265 7
a 1 265 7
reliable 1 265 7

Unfortunately, 1 265 8
he 1 265 8
proves 1 265 8
to 1 265 8
be 1 265 8
just 1 265 8
the 1 265 8
opposite: 1 265 8

not 1 265 10

about 0 265 11

Wills 0 265 12
seems 0 265 12
determined 0 265 12
to 0 265 12
put 0 265 12
the 1 265 12
best 1 265 12
possible 1 265 12
face 1 265 12
on 1 265 12
the 1 265 12
Qur’an, 1 265 12
which 0 265 12
requires 0 265 12
him 0 265 12
to 0 265 12
ignore 0 265 12
a 0 265 12
great 0 265 12

of 0 265 12

incitement 1 265 12
and 1 265 12
hatred. 1 265 12

For 0 265 13
example, 0 265 13
he 0 265 13
quotes 0 265 13
5:51 0 265 13
-- 0 265 13
“You 0 265 13

Because 0 265 27
these 0 265 27

aside. 0 265 27

Throughout 0 265 28
his 0 265 28
book, 0 265 28
Wills’ 0 265 28
assurances 0 265 28
that 0 265 28
the 0 265 28
Qur’an 0 265 28
is 0 265 28
not 0 265 28
really 0 265 28

bad 0 265 28
as 0 265 28
“right-wing 1 265 28

that 0 265 28

that 1 265 28

worse, 1 265 28
dissolve 0 265 28
under 0 265 28
close 0 265 28
scrutiny. 0 265 28

Again 1 265 29
and 1 265 29
again 1 265 29
it 1 265 29
turns 1 265 29
out 1 265 29
that 1 265 29
Wills 1 265 29
has 1 265 29
ignored 1 265 29
key 1 265 29
passages 1 265 29
in 1 265 29
order 1 265 29
to 1 265 29
make 1 265 29
his 1 265 29
case. 1 265 29

He 0 265 30
asks 0 265 30
why 0 265 30
the 0 265 30
Qur’an 0 265 30
is 0 265 30
“so 1 265 30
ferocious 1 265 30

and 0 265 30
apostates” 0 265 30
(p. 0 265 30
124). 0 265 30

Then 0 265 31
he 0 265 31
offers 0 265 31
a 0 265 31
quotation 0 265 31
from 0 265 31
the 0 265 31
New 0 265 31
Testament 0 265 31
Letter 0 265 31
to 0 265 31
the 0 265 31
Hebrews 0 265 31
saying 0 265 31
that 0 265 31
“if 0 265 31
we 0 265 31
sin 0 265 31
again 0 265 31
on 0 265 31
purpose” 0 265 31
there 0 265 31
is 0 265 31
“only 0 265 31
a 1 265 31

come” 0 265 31
(p. 0 265 31

Wills 0 265 32
concludes: 0 265 32
“The 0 265 32
Qur’an 0 265 32
is 0 265 32
not 0 265 32
as 0 265 32
absolute 0 265 32
as 0 265 32
this, 0 265 32
because 0 265 32
it 0 265 32
always 0 265 32
leaves 0 265 32
room 0 265 32
for 0 265 32
God’s 0 265 32
inexhaustible 1 265 32
mercy 1 265 32
and 1 265 32
forgiveness” 1 265 32
(p. 0 265 32
126). 0 265 32

That 1 265 33
sounds 1 265 33
wonderful, 1 265 33
and 0 265 33
certainly 0 265 33
pleasing 0 265 33
to 0 265 33
multicultural 0 265 33
ears 0 265 33
to 0 265 33

that 0 265 33
the 0 265 33

Sara 0 75 16
Berg, 0 75 16
a 0 75 16
senior 0 75 16
writer 0 75 16
at 0 75 16
AMA, 0 75 16
was 0 75 16
the 0 75 16
author 0 75 16
of 0 75 16
the 0 75 16
lengthy 0 75 16

which 0 75 16
calls 0 75 16

all 0 75 16
sorts 0 75 16
of 0 75 16
government 0 75 16
overreach 0 75 16
and 0 75 16
unconstitutional 0 75 16
legislation. 0 75 16

And 0 75 17
though 0 75 17
she 0 75 17
has 0 75 17
a 0 75 17
huge 0 75 17

she 0 75 17
fails, 0 75 17
like 0 75 17
every 0 75 17
other 0 75 17
Socialist 0 75 17

Communist, 0 75 17
to 0 75 17

us 0 75 17
exactly 0 75 17
how 0 75 17
these 0 75 17

out 0 75 17

Berg 0 75 18
and 0 75 18
the 0 75 18
AMA 0 75 18
want 0 75 18
to 0 75 18
pull 0 75 18
a 0 75 18
Dick's 0 75 18

Does 0 75 19
Berg 0 75 19
and 0 75 19
the 0 75 19
AMA 0 75 19
support 0 75 19
our 1 75 19
military? 0 75 19

Do 0 75 20
they 0 75 20
not 0 75 20
know 0 75 20
that 0 75 20
18-year-olds 0 75 20
carry 0 75 20
firearms, 0 75 20
both 0 75 20
handguns 0 75 20
and 0 75 20
rifles? 0 75 20

I 0 75 21
ask, 0 75 21
as 0 75 21
I 0 75 21
do 0 75 21
with 0 75 21
the 0 75 21
issue 0 75 21
concerning 0 75 21
alcohol, 0 75 21
what 0 75 21
is 0 75 21
magic 0 75 21
about 0 75 21
the 0 75 21
age 0 75 21
of 0 75 21
21? 0 75 21

I 0 75 22
ask, 0 75 22
where 0 75 22
does 0 75 22
government 0 75 22
get 0 75 22
to 0 75 22
determine 0 75 22
who 0 75 22
gets 0 75 22
to 0 75 22
do 0 75 22
whatever 0 75 22
at 0 75 22
whatever 0 75 22
age 0 75 22
based 0 75 22
on 0 75 22
an 0 75 22
ambiguous 0 75 22
age 0 75 22
number? 0 75 22

Yet, 0 75 23
if 1 75 23
we 1 75 23
do 1 75 23
that, 1 75 23
we 1 75 23
won't 1 75 23
have 1 75 23
to 1 75 23
worry 1 75 23
about 1 75 23
mass 1 75 23
shooters, 1 75 23
right? 0 75 23

Wrong. 0 75 24

Yeah, 0 75 25
that's 0 75 25
gonna 0 75 25
keep 0 75 25
people 0 75 25
safe. 0 75 25

It's 0 75 26
going 0 75 26
to 0 75 26
infringe 0 75 26
on 0 75 26
the 0 75 26
rights 0 75 26
of 0 75 26
those 0 75 26
who 0 75 26
don't 0 75 26
commit 0 75 26
crimes 0 75 26
and 0 75 26
need 0 75 26
a 0 75 26
gun 0 75 26
to 0 75 26
protect 0 75 26
themselves 0 75 26
or 0 75 26
be 0 75 26
part 0 75 26
of 0 75 26
the 0 75 26
constitutional 0 75 26
militia. 0 75 26

The 0 75 27
AMA 0 75 27
also 0 75 27
wants 0 75 27
to 0 75 27
bypass 0 75 27
the 0 75 27
Fifth 0 75 27
Amendment 0 75 27

found 0 75 27
guilty 0 75 27
of 0 75 27
a 0 75 27

being 0 75 27
deprived 0 75 27
of 0 75 27
their 0 75 27
liberty 0 75 27
and 0 75 27
property 0 75 27
as 0 75 27
they 0 75 27
promote 0 75 27
a 0 75 27
new 0 75 27
legal 0 75 27
procedure 0 75 27
by 0 75 27
which 0 75 27
“family 0 75 27
members, 0 75 27
intimate 0 75 27
partners, 0 75 27

members 0 75 27
and 0 75 27
law 0 75 27
enforcement 0 75 27
personnel” 0 75 27
can 0 75 27
petition 0 75 27
courts 0 75 27
to 0 75 27
confiscate 0 75 27
firearms 0 75 27
from 0 75 27
people 0 75 27
“when 0 75 27
there 0 75 27

or 0 75 27
imminent 0 75 27
risk 0 75 27
for 0 75 27
violence.” 0 75 27

They 0 75 28
want 0 75 28
to 0 75 28
do 0 75 28
what 0 75 28
President 0 75 28
Donald 0 75 28
Trump 0 75 28
suggested 0 75 28
and 0 75 28
"take 0 75 28

first" 0 75 28
and 0 75 28
forget 0 75 28
due 0 75 28
process. 0 75 28

See? 0 75 29

This 0 75 30
is 0 75 30
why 0 75 30
they 0 75 30
should 0 75 30
be 0 75 30
honest 0 75 30
about 0 75 30
who 0 75 30
they 0 75 30
are 0 75 30
and 0 75 30

Non-American 1 75 30
Medical 0 75 30
Association. 0 75 30

I'm 0 75 31
all 0 75 31
for 0 75 31
situations 0 75 31
like 0 75 31
Nikolas 0 75 31
Cruz 0 75 31
who 0 75 31
assaulted 0 75 31

students 0 75 31
being 0 75 31
arrested 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
tried 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
dealt 0 75 31
with 0 75 31
lawfully, 0 75 31
but 0 75 31
to 0 75 31
go 0 75 31
seizing 0 75 31
people's 0 75 31
property 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
denying 0 75 31
them 0 75 31
their 0 75 31

base 0 75 31
on 0 75 31
the 0 75 31
hearsay 0 75 31
of 0 75 31
another 0 75 31
person 0 75 31
is 0 75 31
anti-constitutional 0 75 31
and 0 75 31
anti-American. 1 75 31

Who 0 75 32
knows 0 75 32
exactly 0 75 32
what 0 75 32
they 0 75 32
mean 0 75 32
by 0 75 32
high-capacity 0 75 32
magazines. 0 75 32

I 0 75 33
mean, 0 75 33
for 0 75 33
the 0 75 33
most 0 75 33
part, 0 75 33
you 0 75 33
can 0 75 33
obtain 0 75 33
20 0 75 33
or 0 75 33
30 0 75 33
round 0 75 33

for 0 75 33
both 0 75 33
handguns 0 75 33
and 0 75 33
rifles. 0 75 33

In 0 75 34
some 0 75 34
cases, 0 75 34
you 0 75 34
can 0 75 34
purchase 0 75 34
drums 0 75 34
which 0 75 34
hold 0 75 34
50-100 0 75 34
rounds, 0 75 34
but 0 75 34
if 0 75 34
you 0 75 34
are 0 75 34
in 0 75 34
New 0 75 34

more 0 75 34
than 0 75 34
7 0 75 34
rounds. 0 75 34

As 0 75 35
for 0 75 35
the 0 75 35
nonsensical 1 75 35
call 0 75 35
to 0 75 35
ban 0 75 35

you 0 75 35
are 0 75 35
using 0 75 35

They 0 75 48
also 0 75 48
oppose 0 75 48
concealed 0 75 48
carry 0 75 48
reciprocity, 0 75 48
which 0 75 48
I 0 75 48
do 0 75 48
as 0 75 48
well, 0 75 48
but 0 75 48
based 0 75 48
on 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
principle 0 75 48
that 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
Second 0 75 48
Amendment's 0 75 48
protections 0 75 48
extend 0 75 48
to 0 75 48
the 0 75 48
various 0 75 48
states 0 75 48
as 0 75 48
well, 0 75 48
since 0 75 48
it 0 75 48
recognizes 0 75 48
a 1 75 48
right, 1 75 48
not 1 75 48
a 1 75 48
permission, 1 75 48
to 1 75 48
keep 1 75 48
and 1 75 48
bear 1 75 48
arms. 1 75 48

I 0 75 49
also 0 75 49
oppose 0 75 49
it 0 75 49
because 0 75 49
it's 0 75 49
just 0 75 49
another 0 75 49
step 0 75 49
for 0 75 49
the 0 75 49
federal 0 75 49
government 0 75 49
to 0 75 49
say 0 75 49
they 0 75 49
need 0 75 49
a 0 75 49
database 0 75 49
so 0 75 49
states 0 75 49
can 0 75 49
check, 0 75 49
thus 0 75 49
identifying 0 75 49
gun 0 75 49
owners 0 75 49
and 0 75 49
possibly 0 75 49
their 0 75 49
weapons. 0 75 49

they 0 75 56

them, 1 75 56

plain 0 75 56

Stop 0 266 0
Comparing 0 266 0
Immigration 0 266 0
Enforcement 0 266 0
to 0 266 0
the 0 266 0
Holocaust 0 266 0

The 0 266 1
media 0 266 1
has 0 266 1
2 0 266 1
very 0 266 1
simple 0 266 1
rules 0 266 1
for 0 266 1
Holocaust 0 266 1
analogies. 0 266 1

1. 0 266 2

The 0 266 3
Muslim 0 266 3
Brotherhood's 0 266 3
leaders 0 266 3
praising 0 266 3
Hitler, 0 266 3
calling 0 266 3
for 0 266 3
another 0 266 3
Holocaust 0 266 3
and 0 266 3
killing 0 266 3
Jews 0 266 3
is 0 266 3
nothing 0 266 3
like 0 266 3
the 0 266 3
Holocaust. 0 266 3

And 0 266 4
only 1 266 4
shameless 1 266 4
Zionists 1 266 4
would 1 266 4
attempt 1 266 4
to 1 266 4
equate 1 266 4
killing 1 266 4
Jews 1 266 4
with 1 266 4
killing 1 266 4
Jews. 1 266 4

2. 0 266 5

Anything 1 266 6
a 1 266 6
Republican 1 266 6
president 1 266 6
does 1 266 6
is 1 266 6
exactly 1 266 6
like 1 266 6
the 1 266 6
Holocaust. 1 266 6

A 0 266 7
former 0 266 7
CIA 0 266 7
director 0 266 7
compared 1 266 7
US 1 266 7
immigration 1 266 7
policy 1 266 7
to 1 266 7
Nazi 1 266 7
Germany 1 266 7
in 0 266 7
an 0 266 7
ominous 0 266 7
Tweet. 0 266 7

“Other 0 266 8
governments 0 266 8
have 0 266 8
separated 0 266 8
mothers 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
children,” 0 266 8
Former 0 266 8
CIA 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
NSA 0 266 8
chief 0 266 8
Michael 0 266 8
Hayden 0 266 8
wrote 0 266 8
on 0 266 8
Saturday, 0 266 8
along 0 266 8
with 0 266 8
a 0 266 8
black 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
white 0 266 8
photo 0 266 8
of 0 266 8
the 0 266 8
Birkenau 0 266 8
concentration 0 266 8
and 0 266 8
death-camp 1 266 8
in 0 266 8
Poland. 0 266 8

Then 0 266 9
Hayden 0 266 9
doubled 0 266 9
down 0 266 9
on 0 266 9
that 0 266 9
analogy. 0 266 9

It's 0 266 10
particularly 1 266 10
stupid 1 266 10
of 0 266 10
Michael 0 266 10
Hayden 0 266 10
to 0 266 10
make 0 266 10
that 0 266 10
analogy 0 266 10
because 0 266 10
during 0 266 10
the 0 266 10
Bush 0 266 10
years, 0 266 10
the 0 266 10
agencies 0 266 10
he 0 266 10
ran 0 266 10
were 0 266 10
compared 0 266 10
to 0 266 10
Nazi 1 266 10
Germany. 0 266 10

Repeatedly. 0 266 11

You 0 266 12
might 0 266 12
think 0 266 12
that 0 266 12
would 0 266 12
have 0 266 12
cured 0 266 12
him 0 266 12
of 0 266 12
facile 0 266 12
Nazi 1 266 12
analogies. 0 266 12

But 0 266 13
instead 0 266 13
it 0 266 13
seems 0 266 13
to 0 266 13
have 0 266 13
whetted 0 266 13
his 0 266 13
appetite 0 266 13
for 0 266 13
making 0 266 13
them. 0 266 13

Yes, 0 266 14
the 0 266 14
Nazi 1 266 14
arrested 0 266 14
people, 0 266 14
asked 0 266 14
them 0 266 14
for 0 266 14
ID, 0 266 14
split 0 266 14
up 0 266 14
families 0 266 14
and... 0 266 14
then 0 266 14
killed 1 266 14
them 1 266 14
all. 1 266 14

That's 0 266 15
the 0 266 15
really 0 266 15
relevant 0 266 15
part. 0 266 15

Every 0 266 16
country 0 266 16
arrests 0 266 16
people. 0 266 16

Just 0 266 17
about 0 266 17
every 0 266 17
country 0 266 17
splits 0 266 17
up 0 266 17
families 0 266 17
when 0 266 17
they 0 266 17
arrest 0 266 17
the 0 266 17
parents. 0 266 17

That's 0 266 18
not 0 266 18
unique. 0 266 18

Selecting 0 266 19
the 0 266 19
Jews, 0 266 19
based 0 266 19
on 0 266 19
race, 0 266 19
for 0 266 19
extermination 1 266 19
is 0 266 19
more 0 266 19
of 0 266 19
the 0 266 19
reason 0 266 19
why 0 266 19
the 0 266 19
term 0 266 19
Nazi 1 266 19
is 0 266 19
not 0 266 19
a 0 266 19
positive 0 266 19
one. 0 266 19

Hayden's 0 266 20
thoughtless 1 266 20
tweet 0 266 20
can 0 266 20
just 0 266 20
as 0 266 20
easily 0 266 20
be 0 266 20
used 0 266 20
to 0 266 20
delegitimize 0 266 20
any 0 266 20
and 0 266 20
all 0 266 20
law 0 266 20
enforcement. 0 266 20

The 1 266 21
attacks 1 266 21
here 1 266 21
are 1 266 21
motivated 1 266 21
by 1 266 21
a 1 266 21
desire 1 266 21
for 1 266 21
open 1 266 21
borders. 1 266 21

Children 0 266 21

are 0 266 21

being 0 266 21

used 0 266 21

as 0 266 21

human 1 266 21

shields 1 266 21

Between 0 267 0

British 0 267 1
politician 0 267 1
Nigel 0 267 1
Farage 0 267 1
once 0 267 1
helped 0 267 1
convince 0 267 1
Britons 0 267 1
to 0 267 1
vote 0 267 1
for 0 267 1
Brexit 0 267 1
and 0 267 1
separate 0 267 1
from 0 267 1
the 0 267 1
European 0 267 1
Union, 0 267 1
but 1 267 1
British 1 267 1
establishment 1 267 1
politicians 1 267 1
have 1 267 1
done 1 267 1
everything 1 267 1
they 1 267 1
could 1 267 1
to 1 267 1
sabotage 1 267 1
that 1 267 1
vote 1 267 1
since 1 267 1
then. 1 267 1

Now 0 267 2
Farage 0 267 2
has 0 267 2
apparently 0 267 2
decided 0 267 2
that 0 267 2
if 1 267 2
he 1 267 2
can’t 1 267 2
beat 1 267 2
them, 1 267 2
he’ll 1 267 2
join 1 267 2
them 1 267 2
— 0 267 2
if 0 267 2
not 0 267 2
on 0 267 2
Brexit, 0 267 2
then 0 267 2
in 0 267 2
their 0 267 2
stance 1 267 2
of 1 267 2
denial 1 267 2
and 1 267 2
appeasement 1 267 2
regarding 0 267 2
the 1 267 2
global 1 267 2
jihad 1 267 2
threat.’ 1 267 2

At 0 267 3
a 0 267 3
recent 0 267 3
dinner 0 267 3
of 0 267 3
the 0 267 3
UK 0 267 3
Independence 0 267 3
Party 0 267 3
(UKIP), 0 267 3
which 0 267 3
he 0 267 3
formerly 0 267 3
headed, 0 267 3
Farage 0 267 3
said: 0 267 3
“If 1 267 3
dealing 1 267 3
with 1 267 3
Islamic 1 267 3
fundamentalism 1 267 3
becomes 1 267 3
a 1 267 3
battle 1 267 3
between 1 267 3
us 1 267 3
and 1 267 3
the 1 267 3
entire 1 267 3
religion, 1 267 3
I’ll 1 267 3
tell 1 267 3
you 1 267 3
the 1 267 3
result: 1 267 3
we’ll 1 267 3
lose. 1 267 3

We 1 267 4
will 1 267 4
simply 1 267 4
lose….We 1 267 4
absolutely 1 267 4
have 1 267 4
to 1 267 4
get 1 267 4
that 1 267 4
Muslim 1 267 4
majority 1 267 4
living 1 267 4
in 1 267 4
many 1 267 4
of 1 267 4
our 1 267 4
towns 1 267 4
and 1 267 4
cities 1 267 4
on 1 267 4
our 1 267 4
side, 1 267 4
more 1 267 4
attuned 1 267 4
to 1 267 4
Western 1 267 4
values 1 267 4
than 1 267 4
some 1 267 4
pretty 1 267 4
hardline 1 267 4
interpretations 1 267 4
of 1 267 4
the 1 267 4
Qur’an.” 1 267 4

Sure. 1 267 5

Now 0 267 6
how 0 267 6
does 0 267 6
Farage 0 267 6
propose 0 267 6
to 0 267 6
do 0 267 6
that? 0 267 6

His 0 267 7
warning 0 267 7
against 0 267 7

is 0 267 7
odd. 0 267 7

No 1 267 8

if 1 267 20

about 1 267 20

Another 1 267 21
problem 1 267 21
with 1 267 21
Farage’s 1 267 21
statement 1 267 21
is 1 267 21
that 1 267 21
it 1 267 21
manifests 1 267 21
a 1 267 21
remarkable 1 267 21
ignorance 1 267 21
of 1 267 21
history. 1 267 21

While 1 267 22
he 1 267 22
is 1 267 22
deeply 1 267 22
concerned 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
British 1 267 22
people 1 267 22
not 1 267 22
begin 1 267 22
to 1 267 22
think 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
resisting 1 267 22
jihad 1 267 22
terror 1 267 22
means 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
they 1 267 22
are 1 267 22
in 1 267 22
a 1 267 22
“battle” 1 267 22
with 1 267 22
the 1 267 22
“entire 1 267 22
religion” 1 267 22
of 1 267 22
Islam, 1 267 22
he 1 267 22
appears 1 267 22
unaware 1 267 22
of 1 267 22
the 1 267 22
fact 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
many 1 267 22
Muslims 1 267 22
throughout 1 267 22
history 1 267 22
have 1 267 22
considered 1 267 22
their 1 267 22

Yazdi, 1 267 24
a 1 267 24
fifteenth-century 1 267 24
Persian 1 267 24
who 1 267 24
wrote 1 267 24
a 1 267 24
biography 1 267 24
of 1 267 24
the 1 267 24
Mongol 1 267 24
Muslim 1 267 24
warrior 1 267 24
Tamerlane, 1 267 24
observed 1 267 24
that 1 267 24

of 1 267 24

Muhammad 1 267 25
advises 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
same 1 267 25
thing, 1 267 25
according 1 267 25
to 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
tradition 1 267 25
of 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
Muslim 1 267 25
doctors: 1 267 25
wherefore 0 267 25
the 0 267 25
great 0 267 25
Temur 0 267 25
always 0 267 25
strove 0 267 25
to 1 267 25
exterminate 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
infidels, 1 267 25
as 0 267 25
much 0 267 25
to 0 267 25
acquire 0 267 25
that 0 267 25
glory, 0 267 25
as 0 267 25
to 0 267 25
signalise 0 267 25
himself 0 267 25
by 0 267 25
the 0 267 25
greatness 0 267 25
of 0 267 25
his 0 267 25
conquests.” 0 267 25

After 0 267 26
conquest 0 267 26
came 0 267 26
dhimmitude, 0 267 26
the 0 267 26
subjugated 0 267 26
status 0 267 26
that 0 267 26
the 0 267 26

mandates 0 267 26
for 0 267 26
“the 1 267 26

(primarily 0 267 26
Jews 0 267 26

Christians). 0 267 26

Now, 1 267 28
the 1 267 28
prior 1 267 28
degradation 1 267 28
of 1 267 28
the 1 267 28
infidels 1 267 28
in 1 267 28

it 1 267 28
is 1 267 28
their 1 267 28
lot—is 1 267 28
considered 1 267 28
an 1 267 28
act 1 267 28
of 1 267 28
piety; 1 267 28
and 1 267 28
the 1 267 28

“until 1 267 28

(Koran 1 267 28

is 1 267 28
a 1 267 28
divinely 1 267 28
ordained 1 267 28
obligation….The 1 267 28
dhimmi’s 1 267 28
payment 1 267 28
of 1 267 28
his 1 267 28

will 1 267 28
not 1 267 28
be 1 267 28
tolerated. 1 267 28

It 1 267 29
must 1 267 29
be 1 267 29
exacted 1 267 29
from 1 267 29
him 1 267 29
directly 1 267 29
in 1 267 29
order 1 267 29
to 1 267 29
vilify 1 267 29
and 1 267 29
humiliate 1 267 29
him, 1 267 29
so 1 267 29
that 1 267 29
Islam 1 267 29
and 1 267 29
its 1 267 29
people 1 267 29
may 1 267 29
be 1 267 29
exalted 1 267 29
and 1 267 29
the 1 267 29
race 1 267 29
of 1 267 29
infidels 1 267 29
brought 1 267 29
low. 1 267 29

The 1 267 30
jizya 1 267 30
is 1 267 30
to 1 267 30
be 1 267 30
imposed 1 267 30
on 1 267 30
all 1 267 30
of 1 267 30
them 1 267 30
in 1 267 30
full, 1 267 30
without 1 267 30
exception. 1 267 30

Underlying 0 267 31
this 0 267 31
subjugation 0 267 31
is 0 267 31
a 0 267 31
deep 0 267 31
contempt 0 267 31
for 0 267 31
non-Muslims. 0 267 31

In 0 267 32
the 0 267 32
year 0 267 32
718, 0 267 32
the 1 267 32
Umayyad 1 267 32
caliph 1 267 32
Umar 1 267 32
ibn 1 267 32
Abd 1 267 32
al-Aziz 1 267 32
sent 1 267 32
out 1 267 32
a 1 267 32
message 1 267 32
to 1 267 32
the 1 267 32
governors 1 267 32
of 1 267 32
the 1 267 32
various 1 267 32
Islamic 1 267 32
provinces: 1 267 32

O 1 267 33
you 1 267 33
who 1 267 33
believe! 1 267 33

The 1 267 34
non-Muslims 1 267 34
are 1 267 34
nothing 1 267 34
but 1 267 34
dirt. 1 267 34

Allah 1 267 35
has 1 267 35
created 1 267 35
them 1 267 35
to 1 267 35
be 1 267 35
partisans 1 267 35
of 1 267 35
Satan; 1 267 35
most 1 267 35
treacherous 1 267 35
in 1 267 35
regard 1 267 35
to 1 267 35
all 1 267 35
they 1 267 35
do; 1 267 35
whose 1 267 35
whole 1 267 35
endeavor 1 267 35
in 1 267 35
this 1 267 35
nether 1 267 35
life 1 267 35
is 1 267 35
useless, 1 267 35
though 1 267 35
they 1 267 35
themselves 1 267 35
imagine 1 267 35
that 1 267 35
they 1 267 35
are 1 267 35
doing 1 267 35
fine 1 267 35
work. 1 267 35

Upon 1 267 36
them 1 267 36
rests 1 267 36
the 1 267 36
curse 1 267 36
of 1 267 36
Allah, 1 267 36
of 1 267 36

Angels 1 267 36
and 1 267 36
of 1 267 36
man 1 267 36
collectively 1 267 36

We 0 267 37
must 0 267 37
not 0 267 37
think 0 267 37
that 0 267 37
we 0 267 37
are 0 267 37
at 1 267 37
war 1 267 37
with 1 267 37
the 1 267 37

But 1 267 38
what, 1 267 38
Mr. 1 267 38
Farage, 1 267 38
are 1 267 38
we 1 267 38
to 1 267 38
think 1 267 38
about 1 267 38
the 1 267 38
Muslims 1 267 38
who 1 267 38
consider 1 267 38
themselves 1 267 38
and 1 267 38
their 1 267 38
religion 1 267 38
to 1 267 38

journalists 1 268 22
— 0 268 22
after 1 268 22

that 1 268 22
served 1 268 22

enabled 1 268 22
the 1 268 22

of 1 268 22
wartime 1 268 22

Last 0 268 23
October, 0 268 23
the 0 268 23

Broadcasting 0 268 23
Corporation 0 268 23
journalist 0 268 23
Sarah 0 268 23
Ferguson 0 268 23
interviewed 0 268 23
Hillary 0 268 23
Clinton, 0 268 23
over 1 268 23
whom 1 268 23
she 1 268 23
fawned 1 268 23
as 0 268 23
“the 1 268 23
icon 1 268 23
for 1 268 23
your 1 268 23
generation”. 1 268 23

This 0 268 24
was 0 268 24
the 0 268 24
same 0 268 24
Clinton 0 268 24
who 0 268 24
threatened 0 268 24
to 0 268 24
“obliterate 1 268 24
totally” 1 268 24
Iran 0 268 24
and, 0 268 24
who, 0 268 24
as 0 268 24
U.S. 0 268 24
secretary 0 268 24
of 0 268 24
State 0 268 24
in 0 268 24
2011, 0 268 24
was 0 268 24
one 1 268 24
of 1 268 24
the 1 268 24
instigators 1 268 24
of 1 268 24
the 1 268 24
invasion 1 268 24
and 1 268 24
destruction 1 268 24
of 1 268 24
Libya 1 268 24
as 1 268 24
a 1 268 24
modern 1 268 24
state, 1 268 24
with 0 268 24
the 0 268 24
loss 0 268 24
of 0 268 24
40,000 0 268 24
lives. 0 268 24

Like 1 268 25
the 1 268 25
invasion 1 268 25
of 1 268 25
Iraq, 1 268 25
it 1 268 25
was 1 268 25
based 1 268 25
on 1 268 25
lies. 1 268 25

When 0 268 26
the 0 268 26
Libyan 0 268 26
President 0 268 26
was 0 268 26
murdered 1 268 26
publicly 1 268 26
and 1 268 26
gruesomely 1 268 26
with 0 268 26
a 0 268 26
knife, 0 268 26
Clinton 0 268 26
was 0 268 26
filmed 0 268 26
whooping 1 268 26
and 1 268 26
cheering. 1 268 26

Thanks 1 268 27
largely 1 268 27
to 1 268 27
her, 1 268 27
Libya 1 268 27
became 1 268 27
a 1 268 27
breeding 1 268 27
ground 1 268 27
for 1 268 27
ISIS 1 268 27

a 1 268 33
highly 1 268 33

Instead, 0 268 34
she 0 268 34
invited 0 268 34
Clinton 0 268 34
to 0 268 34

as 0 268 35

Seven 0 268 75
years 0 268 75
ago, 0 268 75
in 0 268 75
Sydney, 0 268 75
I 0 268 75
arranged 0 268 75
to 0 268 75
meet 0 268 75
a 0 268 75
prominent 0 268 75
Liberal 0 268 75

the 0 268 75
Federal 0 268 75
Parliament, 0 268 75
Malcolm 0 268 75
Turnbull. 0 268 75

I 0 268 76
wanted 0 268 76
to 0 268 76
ask 0 268 76
him 0 268 76
to 0 268 76
deliver 0 268 76
a 0 268 76

Gareth 0 268 76

Assange’s 0 268 76
lawyer, 0 268 76
to 0 268 76
the 0 268 76
government. 0 268 76

We 0 268 77
talked 0 268 77
about 0 268 77
his 0 268 77
famous 0 268 77
victory 0 268 77
— 0 268 77
in 0 268 77
the 0 268 77
1980s 0 268 77
when, 0 268 77
as 0 268 77
a 0 268 77
young 0 268 77
barrister, 0 268 77
he 0 268 77
had 0 268 77
fought 0 268 77
the 0 268 77
British 0 268 77
Government’s 0 268 77
attempts 0 268 77
to 0 268 77
suppress 0 268 77

of 0 268 77
the 0 268 77

Spycatcher 0 268 77
— 0 268 77
in 0 268 77
its 0 268 77
way, 0 268 77
a 0 268 77
WikiLeaks 0 268 77
of 0 268 77
the 0 268 77
time, 0 268 77
for 0 268 77

The 0 268 78

of 0 268 78
Australia 0 268 78
was 0 268 78
then 0 268 78
Julia 0 268 78
Gillard, 0 268 78
a 0 268 78
Labor 0 268 78

politician 0 268 78
who 0 268 78
had 0 268 78
declared 0 268 78

“illegal” 0 268 78
and 0 268 78
wanted 0 268 78
to 0 268 78
cancel 0 268 78
Assange’s 0 268 78
passport 0 268 78
— 0 268 78
until 1 268 78
she 1 268 78
was 1 268 78
told 1 268 78
she 1 268 78
could 1 268 78
not 1 268 78
do 1 268 78
this: 1 268 78
that 1 268 78
Assange 1 268 78
had 1 268 78
committed 1 268 78
no 1 268 78
crime: 1 268 78
that 1 268 78
WikiLeaks 1 268 78
was 1 268 78
a 1 268 78
publisher, 1 268 78
whose 1 268 78
work 1 268 78
was 1 268 78

Prime 0 268 79

forced 0 268 79

in 0 268 81

If 0 268 82
there 0 268 82

anything 0 268 82
to 0 268 82
remember 0 268 82
Gillard 0 268 82
by, 0 268 82
it 0 268 82
a 0 268 82
warmongering, 1 268 82
sycophantic, 1 268 82
embarrassing 1 268 82
speech 1 268 82
she 0 268 82
made 0 268 82
to 0 268 82
the 0 268 82
US 0 268 82
Congress 0 268 82
soon 0 268 82
after 0 268 82
she 0 268 82
demanded 0 268 82
the 0 268 82
illegal 0 268 82
cancellation 0 268 82
of 0 268 82

Malcolm 0 268 83

now 0 268 83
the 0 268 83
Prime 0 268 83
Minister 0 268 83
of 0 268 83
Australia. 0 268 83

Julian 0 268 84
Assange’s 0 268 84
father 0 268 84
has 0 268 84
written 0 268 84
to 0 268 84
Turnbull. 0 268 84

It 0 268 85
is 0 268 85
a 0 268 85
moving 0 268 85
letter, 0 268 85
in 0 268 85
which 0 268 85
he 0 268 85
has 0 268 85
appealed 0 268 85
to 0 268 85
the 0 268 85
prime 0 268 85
minister 0 268 85
to 0 268 85
bring 0 268 85
his 0 268 85
son 0 268 85
home. 0 268 85

He 0 268 86
refers 0 268 86
to 0 268 86
the 0 268 86
real 0 268 86
possibility 0 268 86
of 0 268 86
a 0 268 86
tragedy. 0 268 86

I 0 268 87
have 0 268 87
watched 0 268 87
Assange’s 0 268 87
health 0 268 87
deteriorate 0 268 87
in 0 268 87
his 0 268 87
years 0 268 87
of 0 268 87
confinement 0 268 87
without 0 268 87
sunlight. 0 268 87

He 0 268 88
has 0 268 88
had 0 268 88
a 0 268 88
relentless 0 268 88
cough, 0 268 88
but 0 268 88
is 0 268 88
not 0 268 88
even 0 268 88
allowed 0 268 88
safe 0 268 88
passage 0 268 88
to 0 268 88
and 0 268 88
from 0 268 88
a 0 268 88

for 0 268 88
an 0 268 88
X-ray. 0 268 88

Malcolm 1 268 89
Turnbull 1 268 89
can 1 268 89
remain 1 268 89
silent. 1 268 89

Or 1 268 90
he 1 268 90
can 1 268 90
seize 1 268 90
this 1 268 90
opportunity 1 268 90
and 1 268 90
use 1 268 90
his 1 268 90
government’s 1 268 90
diplomatic 1 268 90
influence 1 268 90
to 1 268 90
defend 1 268 90
the 1 268 90
life 1 268 90
of 1 268 90
an 1 268 90
Australian 1 268 90

whose 1 268 90
courageous 1 268 90

people 1 268 90

If 0 270 13

of 0 270 13

Horowitz 0 270 14
“would 0 270 14

the 0 270 14

himself.” 0 270 14

Rep. 0 270 15
King 0 270 15
asked 0 270 15
Horowitz 0 270 15
about 0 270 15
his 0 270 15
first 0 270 15
encounter 0 270 15
with 0 270 15
the 0 270 15
switch 0 270 15
of 0 270 15
“extremely 1 270 15
careless” 1 270 15
for 0 270 15
‘gross 1 270 15
negligence,” 1 270 15
which 0 270 15
violated 0 270 15
a 0 270 15
criminal 0 270 15
statute. 0 270 15

Horowitz 0 270 16
found 0 270 16
that 0 270 16
Peter 0 270 16
Strzok, 0 270 16
Lisa 0 270 16
Page, 0 270 16
and 0 270 16
James 0 270 16
Comey 0 270 16
were 0 270 16
all 0 270 16
involved. 0 270 16

The 0 270 17
IG 0 270 17
also 0 270 17
said 0 270 17
his 0 270 17
team 0 270 17
focused 0 270 17
on 0 270 17
the 0 270 17
fact 0 270 17
that 0 270 17
the 0 270 17
classified 0 270 17
material 0 270 17
on 0 270 17
Clinton’s 0 270 17
server 0 270 17
was 0 270 17
“not 0 270 17
clearly 0 270 17
marked,” 0 270 17
which 0 270 17
repeated 0 270 17
one 0 270 17
of 0 270 17
Clinton’s 0 270 17
claims 0 270 17
about 0 270 17
her 0 270 17
negligence. 1 270 17

As 0 270 18
for 0 270 18
the 0 270 18
question 0 270 18
of 0 270 18
her 0 270 18
“intent,” 0 270 18
Horowitz 0 270 18
said 0 270 18
it 0 270 18
arose 0 270 18
“months 0 270 18
earlier,” 0 270 18
maybe 0 270 18
in 0 270 18
2015, 0 270 18
though 0 270 18
he 0 270 18
couldn’t 0 270 18
be 0 270 18
sure. 0 270 18

King 0 270 19
said 0 270 19
President 0 270 19
Obama 0 270 19
had 0 270 19
suggested 0 270 19
the 0 270 19
“careless 0 270 19
but 0 270 19
not 0 270 19
intentional” 0 270 19
language 0 270 19
in 0 270 19
a 0 270 19

2015. 0 270 19

And 0 270 20
King 0 270 20
had 0 270 20
observed 0 270 20
that 0 270 20
in 0 270 20
his 0 270 20
July 0 270 20

2016 0 270 20

James 0 270 20
Comey 0 270 20
used 0 270 20
“intent” 0 270 20
six 0 270 20
times. 0 270 20

Horowitz 0 270 21
said 0 270 21
Comey 0 270 21
“concealed 0 270 21

The 0 270 21
IG 0 270 21

a 0 270 21
“thorough, 0 270 21

The 0 270 22

Strzok 0 270 23

Ohio 0 270 23
Rep. 0 270 23
James 0 270 23
Jordan 0 270 23
asked 0 270 23
Horowitz 0 270 23
when 0 270 23
his 0 270 23
team 0 270 23
had 0 270 23
discovered 0 270 23
the 0 270 23
message 0 270 23
about 0 270 23
“we’ll 0 270 23
stop” 0 270 23
Trump. 0 270 23

Horowitz 0 270 24
conceded 0 270 24
that 0 270 24
this 0 270 24
meant 0 270 24
“stop 0 270 24
Trump 0 270 24
from 0 270 24
becoming 0 270 24
president.” 0 270 24
The 0 270 24
IG 0 270 24
said 0 270 24
they 0 270 24
uncovered 0 270 24
that 0 270 24
text 0 270 24
in 0 270 24
May, 0 270 24
and 0 270 24
Jordan 0 270 24
asked 0 270 24

Horowitz 0 270 25

adding 0 270 25
that 0 270 25
it 0 270 25

Rod 0 270 25
Rosenstein’s 0 270 25
department 0 270 25
at 0 270 25
the 0 270 25
DOJ. 0 270 25

Jordan 0 270 26
concluded 0 270 26
that 0 270 26
Rosenstein 0 270 26
“made 0 270 26
the 0 270 26

Several 0 270 27

“The 0 270 28

Meadows, 0 270 30
who 0 270 30
charged 0 270 30
that 0 270 30
the 0 270 30

gave 0 270 30
the 0 270 30
IG 0 270 30
“false 0 270 30

key 0 270 30

reports. 0 270 30

“How 0 270 31
did 0 270 31

Comey 0 270 32
didn’t 0 270 32
see 0 270 32
the 0 270 32
whole 0 270 32
thing, 0 270 32
but 0 270 32
explained 0 270 32
that 0 270 32
he 0 270 32
allowed 0 270 32
those 0 270 32
the 0 270 32

By 0 270 33
the 0 270 33
end 0 270 33
of 0 270 33
the 0 270 33
day 0 270 33
it 0 270 33
was 0 270 33
evident 0 270 33
that 0 270 33
Congress 0 270 33
would 0 270 33
have 0 270 33
to 0 270 33
hear 0 270 33
from 0 270 33
Comey, 0 270 33

Strzok 0 270 33
and 0 270 33

Horowitz 0 270 34
confirmed 0 270 34
that 0 270 34
the 0 270 34
IG 0 270 34

Peter 0 270 34
Strzok’s 0 270 34
anti-Trump 0 270 34

Also 0 270 35
on 0 270 35
Tuesday 0 270 35
Peter 0 270 35
Strzok 0 270 35
was 0 270 35
“escorted” 0 270 35
from 0 270 35
the 0 270 35
FBI 0 270 35

As 0 270 36
his 0 270 36
lawyer 0 270 36
told 0 270 36
reporters, 0 270 36
Strzok 0 270 36
had 0 270 36
“played 0 270 36
by 0 270 36
the 0 270 36
rules,” 0 270 36

seems 0 271 36
altogether 0 271 36
fitting 0 271 36
and 0 271 36
proper 0 271 36
that 0 271 36
this 0 271 36

The 0 271 36
year 0 271 36
was 0 271 36
1787—the 0 271 36
year 0 271 36
the 0 271 36
U.S. 0 271 36
Constitution 0 271 36
was 0 271 36
adopted. 0 271 36

The 0 271 37
First 0 271 37
Amendment, 0 271 37
approved 0 271 37
four 0 271 37
years 0 271 37
later, 0 271 37
aimed 0 271 37
at 0 271 37
ensuring 0 271 37
that 0 271 37

make 0 271 41
that 0 271 41

Last 0 271 42
spring, 0 271 42
when 0 271 42

Julian 0 271 42
Assange 0 271 42
for 0 271 42
this 0 271 42
award, 0 271 42
Julian 0 271 42
said 0 271 42
he 0 271 42
would 0 271 42
accept 0 271 42
only 0 271 42
“on 0 271 42

know 0 271 42
if 0 271 42

Bradley 0 271 43

gave 0 271 43

video 0 271 43
of 0 271 43
July 0 271 43
12, 0 271 43
2007 0 271 43
called 0 271 43
“Collateral 0 271 43
Murder.” 0 271 43
Whoever 0 271 43
did 0 271 43
provide 0 271 43
that 0 271 43
graphic 0 271 43
footage, 0 271 43
showing 0 271 43
the 1 271 43
brutality 1 271 43
of 1 271 43
the 1 271 43
celebrated 1 271 43
“surge” 1 271 43
in 1 271 43
Iraq, 1 271 43
was 0 271 43
certainly 0 271 43
far 1 271 43
more 1 271 43
a 1 271 43
patriot 1 271 43
than 0 271 43
the 1 271 43
“mainstream” 1 271 43
journalist 1 271 43
embedded 0 271 43
in 0 271 43
that 0 271 43
same 0 271 43
Army 0 271 43
unit. 0 271 43

He 0 271 44
suppressed 0 271 44
what 0 271 44
happened 0 271 44
in 0 271 44
Baghdad 0 271 44
that 0 271 44
day, 0 271 44
dismissed 0 271 44
it 0 271 44
as 0 271 44
simply 0 271 44
“one 1 271 44
bad 1 271 44
day 1 271 44
in 1 271 44
a 1 271 44
surge 1 271 44
that 1 271 44
was 1 271 44
filled 1 271 44
with 1 271 44
such 1 271 44
days,” 1 271 44
and 0 271 44
then 0 271 44
had 1 271 44
the 1 271 44
temerity 1 271 44
to 1 271 44
lavish 1 271 44
praise 1 271 44
on 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
unit 0 271 44
in 0 271 44
a 0 271 44
book 0 271 44
he 0 271 44
called 0 271 44
“The 0 271 44
Good 0 271 44
Soldiers.” 0 271 44
Julian 0 271 44
is 0 271 44
right 0 271 44
to 0 271 44
emphasize 0 271 44
that 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
world 0 271 44
is 0 271 44
deeply 0 271 44
indebted 0 271 44
to 0 271 44
patriotic 1 271 44
truth-tellers 1 271 44
like 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
sources 0 271 44
who 0 271 44
provided 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
gun-barrel 0 271 44
footage 0 271 44
and 0 271 44
the 0 271 44
many 0 271 44
documents 0 271 44
on 0 271 44
Afghanistan 0 271 44
and 0 271 44
Iraq 0 271 44

We 0 271 45
hope 0 271 45
to 0 271 45
have 0 271 45
a 0 271 45
chance 0 271 45
to 0 271 45
honor 0 271 45
them 0 271 45
in 0 271 45

in 0 271 45
the 0 271 45
future. 0 271 45

Today 0 271 46
we 0 271 46
honor 0 271 46
WikiLeaks, 0 271 46
and 0 271 46
one 0 271 46
of 0 271 46
its 0 271 46
leaders, 0 271 46
Julian 0 271 46
Assange, 0 271 46
for 0 271 46
their 0 271 46
ingenuity 0 271 46
in 0 271 46
creating 0 271 46
a 0 271 46
new 0 271 46
highway 0 271 46
by 0 271 46
which 0 271 46
important 0 271 46
documentary 0 271 46
evidence 0 271 46
can 0 271 46
make 0 271 46
its 0 271 46
way, 0 271 46
quickly 0 271 46
and 0 271 46
confidentially, 0 271 46
through 0 271 46
the 0 271 46
ether 0 271 46
and 0 271 46
into 0 271 46
our 0 271 46
in-boxes. 0 271 46

Long 1 271 47
live 1 271 47
the 1 271 47
Fifth 1 271 47
Estate!” 1 271 47

Eventually 0 271 48
a 0 271 48
compromise 0 271 48
was 0 271 48
found 0 271 48
in 0 271 48
1971 0 271 48
when 0 271 48
Pope 0 271 48
Paul 0 271 48
VI 0 271 48
lifted 0 271 48
the 0 271 48
excommunications 0 271 48
and 0 271 48
Mindszenty 0 271 48
was 0 271 48
able 0 271 48
to 0 271 48
leave 0 271 48
the 0 271 48
U.S. 0 271 48
embassy. 0 271 48

Can 0 271 49
such 0 271 49
a 0 271 49
diplomatic 0 271 49
solution 0 271 49
be 0 271 49
found 0 271 49
to 0 271 49
free 0 271 49
Assange? 0 271 49

It 0 271 50
is 0 271 50
looking 0 271 50
more 0 271 50
and 0 271 50

No 0 272 2

should 0 272 2
be 0 272 2
surprised 0 272 2
by 0 272 2

on 0 272 2
illegals 0 272 2
entering 0 272 2
the 0 272 2
country, 0 272 2

since 0 272 2

When 0 272 3
it 0 272 3
comes 0 272 3
to 0 272 3
the 0 272 3
separation 0 272 3
of 0 272 3
children 0 272 3
from 0 272 3
their 0 272 3
families, 0 272 3
there 0 272 3
is 0 272 3
nothing 0 272 3
new 0 272 3
today 0 272 3
that 0 272 3
was 0 272 3
not 0 272 3
being 0 272 3
done 0 272 3
during 0 272 3
the 0 272 3
Obama 0 272 3
reign. 0 272 3

In 0 272 4
2013, 0 272 4
Obama 0 272 4
began 0 272 4
bringing 0 272 4
into 0 272 4
the 0 272 4
US 0 272 4
literally 0 272 4
over 0 272 4

people, 0 272 4
mainly 0 272 4
below 0 272 4
age 0 272 4
21. 0 272 4

They 0 272 5
were 0 272 5
bused, 0 272 5
flown, 0 272 5
and 0 272 5
met 0 272 5
at 0 272 5
the 0 272 5
US 0 272 5
border 0 272 5
with 0 272 5
Mexico 0 272 5

could 0 272 6
not 0 272 6
be 0 272 6
set 0 272 6

thus 0 272 6
Obama 0 272 6

The 0 272 17
surge 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
children 0 272 17
into 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
US 0 272 17
from 0 272 17
various 0 272 17
countries 0 272 17
south 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
border 0 272 17
was 0 272 17
said 0 272 17
to 0 272 17
be 0 272 17
the 0 272 17
result 0 272 17
of 0 272 17
economics, 0 272 17
high 0 272 17
crime 0 272 17
rates, 0 272 17
and 0 272 17
actual 0 272 17
threats 0 272 17
from 0 272 17
organized 0 272 17
crime 0 272 17
entities. 0 272 17

Another 0 272 18
excuse 1 272 18
used 0 272 18
by 0 272 18
the 0 272 18
Obama 0 272 18
government 0 272 18
was 0 272 18
to 0 272 18
bring 0 272 18
them 0 272 18
here 0 272 18
to 0 272 18
find 0 272 18
their 0 272 18
families 0 272 18
already 0 272 18
in 0 272 18
the 0 272 18
US. 0 272 18

Thus, 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
idea 0 272 19
that 0 272 19
separating 1 272 19
children 0 272 19
from 0 272 19
their 0 272 19
parents 0 272 19
as 0 272 19
being 0 272 19
something 0 272 19
new, 0 272 19
done 0 272 19
only 0 272 19
by 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
Trump 0 272 19
Administration 0 272 19
is 0 272 19
absurd, 1 272 19
since 0 272 19
we 0 272 19
really 0 272 19
have 0 272 19
no 0 272 19
idea 0 272 19
whether 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
children 0 272 19
brought 0 272 19
here 0 272 19
during 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
Obama 0 272 19
reign 0 272 19
were 0 272 19
intentionally 0 272 19
separated 1 272 19
from 0 272 19
their 0 272 19
parents 0 272 19
by 0 272 19
the 0 272 19
US 0 272 19
government 0 272 19
at 0 272 19
that 0 272 19
time, 0 272 19
or 0 272 19
not. 0 272 19

We 0 272 20
have 0 272 20
only 0 272 20
what 0 272 20
little 0 272 20
information 0 272 20
the 0 272 20
government 0 272 20
told 0 272 20
us 0 272 20
then, 0 272 20
which 0 272 20
was 0 272 20
not 0 272 20
very 0 272 20
much, 0 272 20
considering 0 272 20
the 0 272 20
fact 0 272 20
that 0 272 20
Obama 0 272 20
wanted 0 272 20
to 0 272 20
keep 0 272 20
as 0 272 20
much 0 272 20
of 0 272 20
this 0 272 20
situation 0 272 20
as 0 272 20
secret 0 272 20
as 0 272 20
possible. 0 272 20

What 0 272 21
many 0 272 21
do 0 272 21
not 0 272 21
realize 0 272 21
is, 0 272 21
today's 0 272 21
policy 0 272 21
of 0 272 21
separating 1 272 21
underage 0 272 21
siblings 0 272 21
from 0 272 21
their 0 272 21
parents 0 272 21
once 0 272 21
they 0 272 21
cross 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
border 0 272 21
illegally 0 272 21
into 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
US 0 272 21
seems 0 272 21
to 0 272 21
be 0 272 21
a 0 272 21
planned 0 272 21
event 0 272 21
by 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
US 0 272 21
government 0 272 21
going 0 272 21
all 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
way 0 272 21
back 0 272 21
to 0 272 21
the 0 272 21
domestic 0 272 21
military 0 272 21
exercises 0 272 21
known 0 272 21
as 0 272 21
Jade 0 272 21
Helm 0 272 21
in 0 272 21
2015. 0 272 21

Many 0 272 22
remember 0 272 22
the 0 272 22
military 0 272 22
taking 0 272 22
over 0 272 22
several 0 272 22
Walmart 0 272 22
locations, 0 272 22
mainly 0 272 22
in 0 272 22
Texas, 0 272 22
during 0 272 22
the 0 272 22
Jade 0 272 22
Helm 0 272 22
exercises. 0 272 22

This, 0 272 23
along 0 272 23
with 0 272 23
the 0 272 23
federal 0 272 23
government 0 272 23
grab 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
millions 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
acres 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
land 0 272 23
during 0 272 23
the 0 272 23
Obama 0 272 23
years, 0 272 23
speaks 0 272 23
volumes 0 272 23
in 0 272 23
the 0 272 23
government's 0 272 23
plan 0 272 23
to 0 272 23
be 0 272 23
able 0 272 23
to 0 272 23
handle 0 272 23
millions 0 272 23
of 0 272 23
people. 0 272 23

Since 0 272 24
Obama 0 272 24
planned 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
have 0 272 24
over 0 272 24
a 0 272 24
million 0 272 24
Muslim 0 272 24
refugees 0 272 24
brought 0 272 24
into 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
US 0 272 24
over 0 272 24
a 0 272 24
short 0 272 24
period 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
time, 0 272 24
along 0 272 24
with 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
hundreds 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
thousands 0 272 24
of 0 272 24
illegal 0 272 24
immigrants 0 272 24
coming 0 272 24
in, 0 272 24
one 0 272 24
can 0 272 24
understand 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
reason 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
Feds 0 272 24
had 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
have 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
Walmart 0 272 24
stores 0 272 24
and 0 272 24
so 0 272 24
much 0 272 24
land, 0 272 24
as 0 272 24
they 0 272 24
needed 0 272 24
housing 0 272 24
for 0 272 24
the 0 272 24
millions 0 272 24
they 0 272 24
planned 0 272 24
to 0 272 24
bring 0 272 24
in. 0 272 24

Despite 0 272 25
President 0 272 25
Trump 0 272 25
signing 0 272 25
an 0 272 25
Executive 0 272 25
Order 0 272 25
suspending 0 272 25
Syrian 0 272 25

from 0 272 25
entering 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
US 0 272 25

120 0 272 25
days 0 272 25
on 0 272 25
Jan. 0 272 25
26, 0 272 25
2017 0 272 25
while 0 272 25
security 0 272 25
measures 0 272 25
were 0 272 25
reviewed, 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
US 0 272 25
still 0 272 25
imported 0 272 25
110,000 0 272 25
refugees 0 272 25
from 0 272 25
Syria 0 272 25
and 0 272 25
various 0 272 25
other 0 272 25
countries 0 272 25
into 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
US 0 272 25
in 0 272 25
2017 0 272 25
alone, 0 272 25
up 0 272 25
from 0 272 25
85,000 0 272 25
the 0 272 25
previous 0 272 25
year. 0 272 25

These 0 272 26
numbers 0 272 26
follow 0 272 26
Obama's 0 272 26
projections 0 272 26
of 0 272 26
the 0 272 26
expected 0 272 26
amount 0 272 26
of 0 272 26

US. 0 272 26

Of 0 272 27
course, 0 272 27
as 0 272 27
with 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
number 0 272 27
of 0 272 27
illegal 0 272 27
immigrants 0 272 27
entering 0 272 27
our 0 272 27
county, 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
Feds 0 272 27
downplay 0 272 27
the 0 272 27
actual 0 272 27
number 0 272 27
which 0 272 27
always 0 272 27
ends 0 272 27
up 0 272 27
to 0 272 27
be 0 272 27
more 0 272 27
than 0 272 27
quadruple 0 272 27
their 0 272 27
stated 0 272 27
number. 0 272 27

What 0 272 28
we 0 272 28
seem 0 272 28
to 0 272 28
have 0 272 28
here 0 272 28
with 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
illegal 0 272 28
immigration 0 272 28
situation 0 272 28
today 0 272 28
is 0 272 28
some 1 272 28
very 1 272 28
good 1 272 28
actors 1 272 28
on 1 272 28
the 1 272 28
Left 1 272 28
accusing 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
Trump 0 272 28
Administration 0 272 28
of 0 272 28
being 0 272 28
cruel 1 272 28
and 0 272 28
insensitive 1 272 28
with 0 272 28
separating 1 272 28
children 0 272 28
from 0 272 28
their 0 272 28
families 0 272 28
once 0 272 28
they 0 272 28

Mexican 0 272 28
border 0 272 28
into 0 272 28
the 0 272 28
US. 0 272 28

When 0 272 29
in 0 272 29
fact, 0 272 29
their 0 272 29
idol, 1 272 29
Obama 0 272 29
did 0 272 29
the 0 272 29
same 0 272 29
thing 0 272 29
for 0 272 29
years 0 272 29
during 0 272 29
his 0 272 29
time 0 272 29
in 0 272 29
power. 0 272 29

What 0 272 30
they 0 272 30
do 0 272 30
not 0 272 30
want 0 272 30
to 0 272 30
admit 0 272 30
to 0 272 30
is 0 272 30
the 0 272 30
fact 0 272 30
that 0 272 30
today's 0 272 30
illegal 0 272 30
immigration 0 272 30
picture 0 272 30
is 0 272 30
one 0 272 30
that 0 272 30
follows 0 272 30
the 0 272 30
Obama 0 272 30
plan 0 272 30
on 0 272 30
dealing 0 272 30
with 0 272 30

President 0 272 31
Trump, 0 272 31
on 0 272 31
the 0 272 31
other 0 272 31
hand, 0 272 31
is 0 272 31
following 0 272 31
along 0 272 31
with 0 272 31
it 0 272 31
by 0 272 31
detaining 0 272 31
illegal 0 272 31
immigrants 0 272 31
at 0 272 31

children 0 272 31
from 0 272 31
their 0 272 31
apparent 0 272 31
families. 0 272 31

Since 0 272 32
no 0 272 32
one 0 272 32
can 0 272 32
know 0 272 32
if 0 272 32
the 0 272 32
children 0 272 32
really 0 272 32
belong 0 272 32
to 0 272 32
the 0 272 32
illegals 0 272 32
who 0 272 32
say 0 272 32
they 0 272 32
are 0 272 32
their 0 272 32
parents, 0 272 32
they 0 272 32
are 0 272 32
separated 1 272 32
until 0 272 32
that 0 272 32
can 0 272 32

along 0 272 32
with 0 272 32

The 0 272 33
bottom 0 272 33

is, 0 272 33
both 0 272 33
the 0 272 33
Left 0 272 33
and 0 272 33
the 0 272 33
Trump 0 272 33

seem 0 272 33
to 0 272 33
be 0 272 33

of 0 272 33

All 0 272 34
of 0 272 34
which 0 272 34
seems 0 272 34
to 0 272 34
be 0 272 34
a 0 272 34

event. 0 272 34

In 0 272 35
any 0 272 35
case, 0 272 35
neither 0 272 35
side 0 272 35

everywhere 0 160 9

Why? 0 160 10

No. 0 160 12

‘Cause 1 160 13

the 1 160 13

exactly 0 68 14
when 0 68 14

that 0 68 19
slowly 0 68 19

surely 0 68 19

The 0 163 15

that 0 163 15
the 0 163 15
Church 0 163 15

Yore 0 163 16
called 0 163 16
the 0 163 16
example 0 163 16
Pope 0 163 16

have 0 163 20
said, 0 163 20
contradicting 0 163 20
the 0 163 20
Pope’s 0 163 20
recent 0 163 20
insistence 0 163 20
that 0 163 20

no 0 163 20
evidence 0 163 20
had 0 163 20
been 0 163 20
produced. 0 163 20

Francis 0 163 21
encountered 0 163 21
protests 0 163 21
in 0 163 21
Chile 0 163 21
over 0 163 21
his 0 163 21
defense 0 163 21
of 0 163 21
Barros 0 163 21
during 0 163 21
his 0 163 21
visit 0 163 21
there 0 163 21
last 0 163 21
month, 0 163 21
calling 0 163 21
the 0 163 21
accusations 0 163 21
against 0 163 21
the 0 163 21
priest 0 163 21
“calumny.” 1 163 21

While 0 163 22
Francis 0 163 22
later 0 163 22
apologized, 0 163 22
he 0 163 22
persisted 0 163 22
in 0 163 22
defending 0 163 22
Barros, 0 163 22
denying 0 163 22
that 0 163 22
he 0 163 22
had 0 163 22
received 0 163 22
any 0 163 22
testimony 0 163 22
himself 0 163 22
and 0 163 22
restating 0 163 22
that 0 163 22
such 0 163 22
unproven 0 163 22
accusations 0 163 22
are 0 163 22
“slander.” 1 163 22

The 0 163 23
Pope 0 163 23
later 0 163 23
said 0 163 23
he 0 163 23
would 0 163 23
send 0 163 23
Malta 0 163 23
Archbishop 0 163 23

Chile 0 163 23
to 0 163 23
investigate 0 163 23
the 0 163 23
matter. 0 163 23

Expectations 0 163 24
were 0 163 24
high 0 163 24
in 0 163 24
2014 0 163 24
when 0 163 24
the 0 163 24
Pope 0 163 24
created 0 163 24
the 0 163 24
abuse 0 163 24
commission. 0 163 24

And 0 163 25
while 0 163 25
he 0 163 25
has 0 163 25
continually 0 163 25
condemned 0 163 25
clergy 0 163 25
sex 0 163 25
abuse 0 163 25
throughout 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
pontificate, 0 163 25
some 0 163 25
have 0 163 25
argued 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
actions 0 163 25
in 0 163 25
some 0 163 25
serious 0 163 25
cases 0 163 25
don’t 0 163 25
match 0 163 25
his 0 163 25
tough 0 163 25
stances 0 163 25
on 0 163 25
abuse. 0 163 25

Four 0 163 26
members 0 163 26
of 0 163 26
the 0 163 26
commission 0 163 26
had 0 163 26
met 0 163 26
with 0 163 26
Cardinal 0 163 26
O’Malley 0 163 26
in 0 163 26
2015, 0 163 26
conveying 0 163 26
their 0 163 26
objections 0 163 26
to 0 163 26
Francis’s 0 163 26
2015 0 163 26
appointment 0 163 26
of 0 163 26
Barros 0 163 26
as 0 163 26
bishop 0 163 26
of 0 163 26
Osorno. 0 163 26

It 0 163 27
was 0 163 27
at 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
meeting 0 163 27
with 0 163 27
O’Malley 0 163 27
that 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
abuse 0 163 27
commission 0 163 27
representatives 0 163 27
reportedly 0 163 27
gave 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
letter 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
cardinal 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
deliver 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
Francis, 0 163 27
and 0 163 27
O’Malley 0 163 27
later 0 163 27
confirmed 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
a 0 163 27
commission 0 163 27
member 0 163 27
that 0 163 27
he 0 163 27
had 0 163 27
in 0 163 27
fact 0 163 27
personally 0 163 27
delivered 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
letter 0 163 27
to 0 163 27
the 0 163 27
Pope. 0 163 27

Yore 0 163 28
explained 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
Pope 0 163 28
has 0 163 28
been 0 163 28
told 0 163 28
from 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
moment 0 163 28
he 0 163 28
appointed 0 163 28
Barros 0 163 28
in 0 163 28
2015 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
it 0 163 28
was 0 163 28
a 0 163 28
bad 0 163 28
decision, 0 163 28
between 0 163 28
the 0 163 28
Chilean 0 163 28
bishops’ 0 163 28
conference, 0 163 28
petitions, 0 163 28
letters 0 163 28
and 0 163 28
calls, 0 163 28
that 0 163 28
were 0 163 28
all 0 163 28
ignored. 0 163 28

Further, 0 163 29
a 0 163 29
Chilean 0 163 29
judicial 0 163 29
inquiry 0 163 29
found 0 163 29
all 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
victims 0 163 29
who 0 163 29
testified 0 163 29
— 0 163 29
including 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
letter’s 0 163 29
author 0 163 29
Juan 0 163 29
Carlos 0 163 29
— 0 163 29
to 0 163 29
be 0 163 29
credible, 0 163 29
and 0 163 29
that 0 163 29
there 0 163 29
was 0 163 29
a 0 163 29
major 0 163 29
cover-up 0 163 29
of 0 163 29
the 0 163 29
abuse 0 163 29
by 0 163 29
Father 0 163 29
Karadima. 0 163 29

Arroyo 0 163 30
spoke 0 163 30
with 0 163 30
Cruz 0 163 30
as 0 163 30
well, 0 163 30
who 0 163 30
said 0 163 30
he 0 163 30
was 0 163 30
“incredibly 1 163 30
frustrated” 1 163 30
when 0 163 30
Barros 0 163 30
was 0 163 30
going 0 163 30
to 0 163 30
be 0 163 30
appointed. 0 163 30

He’d 0 163 31
testified 0 163 31
about 0 163 31
three 0 163 31
bishops 0 163 31
who 0 163 31
had 0 163 31
witnessed 0 163 31
abuse, 0 163 31
he 0 163 31
said, 0 163 31
but 0 163 31
Barros 0 163 31
had 0 163 31
special 0 163 31
significance 0 163 31
for 0 163 31
him 0 163 31
because 0 163 31
Barros’ 0 163 31
part 0 163 31
went 0 163 31
beyond 0 163 31
witnessing 0 163 31
the 0 163 31
abuse, 0 163 31
to 0 163 31
violating 1 163 31
his 1 163 31
seal 1 163 31
of 1 163 31
Confession 1 163 31
with 1 163 31
Karadima 1 163 31
and 0 163 31
psychological 0 163 31
abuse 0 163 31
through 0 163 31
intimidation. 0 163 31

Cruz 0 163 32
recounted 0 163 32
how 0 163 32
he 0 163 32
and 0 163 32
other 0 163 32
victims 0 163 32
had 0 163 32
been 0 163 32
dismissed 0 163 32
or 0 163 32
slandered 0 163 32
by 0 163 32
local 0 163 32
Church 0 163 32
hierarchy 0 163 32
for 0 163 32
numerous 0 163 32
attempts 0 163 32
to 0 163 32
be 0 163 32
heard. 0 163 32

And 0 163 33
he 0 163 33
spoke 0 163 33
about 0 163 33
holding 0 163 33
out 0 163 33
hope 0 163 33
that 0 163 33
there 0 163 33
would 0 163 33
be 0 163 33
a 0 163 33
different 0 163 33
response 0 163 33
from 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
Pope, 0 163 33
discussing 0 163 33
specifics 0 163 33
of 0 163 33
getting 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
letter 0 163 33
to 0 163 33
the 0 163 33
Francis 0 163 33
via 0 163 33
Cardinal 0 163 33
O’Malley. 0 163 33

Cruz 0 163 34
told 0 163 34
Arroyo 0 163 34
he 0 163 34
was 0 163 34
really 0 163 34
hurt 0 163 34
and 0 163 34
felt 0 163 34
betrayed 0 163 34
by 0 163 34
the 0 163 34
Pope’s 0 163 34
comments 0 163 34
that 0 163 34
the 0 163 34
accusations 0 163 34
were 0 163 34
slander, 0 163 34
and 0 163 34
there 0 163 34
were 0 163 34
no 0 163 34
witnesses 0 163 34
or 0 163 34
evidence. 0 163 34

“To 0 163 35
hear 0 163 35
him 0 163 35
talk 0 163 35
about 0 163 35
us 0 163 35
that 0 163 35
way,” 0 163 35
Cruz 0 163 35
said, 0 163 35
“calling 0 163 35
us 0 163 35
slanderers, 0 163 35
it 0 163 35
was 0 163 35
terrible 0 163 35
because 0 163 35
it 0 163 35
set 0 163 35
the 0 163 35
clock 0 163 35
back 0 163 35
for 0 163 35
so 0 163 35
many 0 163 35
victims.” 0 163 35

Scicluna 0 163 36
will 0 163 36
be 0 163 36
meeting 0 163 36
with 0 163 36
Cruz, 0 163 36
who 0 163 36
said 0 163 36
he 0 163 36
hopes 0 163 36
other 0 163 36
abuse 0 163 36
survivors 0 163 36
will 0 163 36
be 0 163 36
heard 0 163 36
as 0 163 36
a 0 163 36
result 0 163 36
of 0 163 36
his 0 163 36

in 0 163 43

of 0 163 43
children. 0 163 43

“So 0 163 44
I 0 163 44
don’t 0 163 44
think 0 163 44
this 0 163 44
is 0 163 44

maybe 0 163 48
even 0 163 48
some 0 163 48
even 0 163 48

the 0 165 12
Israeli 0 165 12
Ministry 0 165 12
of 0 165 12
Intelligence, 0 165 12
echoed 0 165 12
the 0 165 12
FDD: 0 165 12
"If 1 165 12
you 1 165 12
(Americans) 1 165 12
are 1 165 12
committed 1 165 12
to 1 165 12
countering 1 165 12
Iran 1 165 12
in 1 165 12
the 1 165 12
region, 1 165 12
then 1 165 12
you 1 165 12
must 1 165 12
do 1 165 12
so 1 165 12
in 1 165 12
Syria--first." 1 165 12

Our 0 165 13
orders 0 165 13
have 0 165 13
been 0 165 13
cut. 0 165 13

Iran 0 165 14
has 0 165 14
dismissed 0 165 14
as 0 165 14
"lies" 1 165 14
and 1 165 14
"ridiculous" 1 165 14
the 0 165 14
charge 0 165 14
that 0 165 14
it 0 165 14
sent 0 165 14
the 0 165 14
drone 0 165 14
into 0 165 14
Israeli 0 165 14
airspace. 0 165 14

If 0 165 15
Tehran 0 165 15
did, 0 165 15
it 0 165 15
would 0 165 15
be 0 165 15
an 0 165 15
act 0 165 15
of 0 165 15
monumental 1 165 15
stupidity. 1 165 15

Not 0 165 16
only 0 165 16
did 0 165 16
the 0 165 16
drone 0 165 16
bring 0 165 16
devastating 0 165 16
Israeli 0 165 16
reprisals 0 165 16
against 0 165 16
Syria 0 165 16
and 0 165 16
embarrass 0 165 16
Iran's 0 165 16
ally 0 165 16
Russia, 0 165 16
it 0 165 16
brought 0 165 16
attacks 0 165 16

and 0 165 16
possibly 0 165 16
Russian-manned 0 165 16

Moreover, 0 165 17
in 0 165 17
recent 0 165 17
months 0 165 17
Iranian 0 165 17
policy--suspending 0 165 17

boat 0 165 17
harassment 0 165 17
of 0 165 17
U.S. 0 165 17

crafted 0 165 17
to 0 165 17
ease 0 165 17
tensions 0 165 17
and 0 165 17
provide 0 165 17
no 0 165 17
new 0 165 17
causes 0 165 17
for 0 165 17
Trump 0 165 17

as 0 165 17
his 0 165 17
legacy. 0 165 17

Indeed, 0 165 18
why 0 165 18
would 0 165 18
Iran, 0 165 18
which, 0 165 18
with 0 165 18
Assad, 0 165 18
Russia 0 165 18
and 0 165 18
Hezbollah, 0 165 18
is 0 165 18
among 0 165 18
the 0 165 18
victors 0 165 18
in 0 165 18
Syria's 0 165 18
six-year 0 165 18

war, 0 165 18
wish 0 165 18
to 0 165 18
reignite 0 165 18
the 0 165 18
bloodletting 0 165 18
and 0 165 18
bring 0 165 18
Israeli 0 165 18
and 0 165 18
U.S. 0 165 18
firepower 0 165 18
in 0 165 18
on 0 165 18
the 0 165 18
other 0 165 18
side? 0 165 18

In 0 165 19
Syria's 0 165 19
southeast, 0 165 19
another 0 165 19
incident 0 165 19
a 0 165 19
week 0 165 19
ago 0 165 19
may 0 165 19
portend 0 165 19
an 0 165 19
indefinite 0 165 19
U.S. 0 165 19
stay 0 165 19
in 0 165 19
that 0 165 19
broken 0 165 19
and 0 165 19
bleeding 0 165 19
country. 0 165 19

To 0 165 20
recapture 0 165 20
oil 0 165 20
fields 0 165 20
lost 0 165 20
in 0 165 20
the 0 165 20
war, 0 165 20
forces 0 165 20
backed 0 165 20
by 0 165 20
Assad 0 165 20
crossed 0 165 20
the 0 165 20
Euphrates 0 165 20
into 0 165 20
territory 0 165 20
taken 0 165 20
from 0 165 20
ISIS 0 165 20
by 0 165 20
the 0 165 20
U.S. 0 165 20
and 0 165 20
our 0 165 20
Kurd 0 165 20
allies. 0 165 20

The 0 165 21
U.S. 0 165 21
response 0 165 21
was 0 165 21
a 0 165 21
barrage 0 165 21
of 0 165 21
air 0 165 21
and 0 165 21
artillery 0 165 21
strikes 0 165 21
that 0 165 21
killed 0 165 21
100 0 165 21
soldiers. 0 165 21

What 0 165 22
this 0 165 22
signals 0 165 22
is 0 165 22
that, 0 165 22
though 0 165 22
ISIS 0 165 22
has 0 165 22
been 0 165 22
all 0 165 22
but 0 165 22
evicted 0 165 22
from 0 165 22
Syria, 0 165 22
the 0 165 22
U.S. 0 165 22
intends 0 165 22
to 0 165 22
retain 0 165 22
that 0 165 22
fourth 0 165 22
of 0 165 22
Syria 0 165 22
as 0 165 22
a 0 165 22
bargaining 1 165 22
chip 1 165 22
in 0 165 22
negotiations. 0 165 22

In 0 165 23
the 0 165 23
northwest, 0 165 23
Turkey 0 165 23
has 0 165 23
sent 0 165 23
its 0 165 23
Syrian 0 165 23
allies 0 165 23
to 0 165 23
attack 0 165 23
Afrin 0 165 23
and 0 165 23
President 0 165 23
Recep 0 165 23
Tayyip 0 165 23
Erdogan 0 165 23
has 0 165 23
threatened 0 165 23
Manbij, 0 165 23
80 0 165 23
miles 0 165 23
to 0 165 23
the 0 165 23
east, 0 165 23
where 0 165 23
U.S. 0 165 23
troops 0 165 23
commingle 0 165 23
with 0 165 23
the 0 165 23
Kurd 0 165 23
defenders 0 165 23
and 0 165 23
U.S. 0 165 23
generals 0 165 23
were 0 165 23
visible 0 165 23
last 0 165 23
week. 0 165 23

Midweek, 0 165 24
Erdogan 1 165 24
exploded: 1 165 24
"(The 0 165 24
Americans) 0 165 24
tell 0 165 24
us, 0 165 24
'Don't 0 165 24
come 0 165 24
to 0 165 24
Manbij.' 0 165 24

We 0 165 25
will 0 165 25
come 0 165 25
to 0 165 25
Manbij 0 165 25
to 0 165 25
hand 0 165 25
over 0 165 25
these 0 165 25
territories 0 165 25
to 0 165 25
their 0 165 25
rightful 0 165 25
owners." 0 165 25

The 0 165 26
U.S. 0 165 26
and 0 165 26
Turkey, 0 165 26
allies 0 165 26
for 0 165 26
six 0 165 26
decades, 0 165 26
with 0 165 26
the 0 165 26
largest 0 165 26
armies 0 165 26
in 0 165 26
NATO, 0 165 26
may 0 165 26
soon 0 165 26
be 0 165 26
staring 0 165 26
down 0 165 26
each 0 165 26
other's 0 165 26
gun 0 165 26
barrels. 0 165 26

Has 1 165 27
President 1 165 27
Trump 1 165 27
thought 1 165 27
through 1 165 27
where 1 165 27
we 1 165 27
are 1 165 27
going 1 165 27
with 1 165 27
this 1 165 27
deepening 1 165 27
commitment 1 165 27
in 1 165 27
Syria, 1 165 27
where 0 165 27
we 0 165 27
have 0 165 27
only 0 165 27
2,000 0 165 27
troops 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
no 0 165 27
allies 0 165 27
but 0 165 27
the 0 165 27
Kurds, 0 165 27
while 0 165 27
on 0 165 27
the 0 165 27
other 0 165 27
side 0 165 27
is 0 165 27
the 0 165 27
Syrian 0 165 27
army, 0 165 27
Hezbollah, 0 165 27
Russia 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
Iran, 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
Shiite 0 165 27
militias 0 165 27
from 0 165 27
Iraq, 0 165 27
Afghanistan 0 165 27
and 0 165 27
Pakistan? 0 165 27

Clearly, 0 165 28
we 0 165 28
have 0 165 28
an 0 165 28
obligation 0 165 28
not 0 165 28
to 0 165 28
abandon 0 165 28
the 0 165 28
Kurds, 0 165 28
who 0 165 28
took 0 165 28
most 0 165 28
of 0 165 28
the 0 165 28
casualties 0 165 28
in 0 165 28
liberating 0 165 28
eastern 0 165 28
Syria 0 165 28
from 0 165 28
ISIS. 0 165 28

And 0 165 29
we 0 165 29
have 0 165 29
a 0 165 29
strategic 0 165 29
interest 0 165 29
in 0 165 29
not 0 165 29
losing 0 165 29
Turkey 0 165 29
as 0 165 29
an 0 165 29
ally. 0 165 29

But 0 165 30
this 0 165 30
calls 0 165 30
for 0 165 30
active 1 165 30
diplomacy, 1 165 30
not 1 165 30
military 1 165 30
action. 1 165 30

And 0 165 31
now 0 165 31
that 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
rebels 0 165 31
have 0 165 31
been 0 165 31
defeated 0 165 31
and 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
civil 0 165 31
war 0 165 31
is 0 165 31
almost 0 165 31
over, 0 165 31
what 0 165 31
would 0 165 31
be 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
cost 0 165 31
and 0 165 31
what 0 165 31
would 0 165 31
be 0 165 31
the 0 165 31
prospects 0 165 31
of 0 165 31
fighting 0 165 31
a 0 165 31
new 0 165 31
and 0 165 31
wider 0 165 31
war? 0 165 31

What 0 165 32
would 0 165 32
victory 0 165 32
look 0 165 32
like? 0 165 32

Bibi 0 165 33
and 0 165 33
the 0 165 33
FDD 0 165 33
want 0 165 33
to 0 165 33
see 0 165 33
U.S. 0 165 33
power 0 165 33
deployed 0 165 33
alongside 0 165 33
that 0 165 33
of 0 165 33
Israel, 0 165 33
against 0 165 33
Iran, 0 165 33
Assad 0 165 33
and 0 165 33
Hezbollah. 0 165 33

But 0 165 34
while 0 165 34
Israel's 0 165 34
interests 0 165 34
are 0 165 34
clear, 0 165 34
what 1 165 34
would 1 165 34
be 1 165 34
the 1 165 34
U.S. 1 165 34
vital 1 165 34
interest? 1 165 34

What 1 165 35
outcome 1 165 35
would 1 165 35
justify 1 165 35
another 1 165 35
U.S. 1 165 35
war 1 165 35
in 1 165 35
a 1 165 35
region 1 165 35
where 1 165 35
all 1 165 35
the 1 165 35
previous 1 165 35
wars 1 165 35
in 1 165 35
this 1 165 35
century 1 165 35
have 1 165 35
left 1 165 35
us 1 165 35
bleeding, 1 165 35
bankrupt, 1 165 35
divided 1 165 35
and 1 165 35
disillusioned? 1 165 35

When 1 165 36
he 1 165 36
was 1 165 36
running 1 165 36
, 1 165 36
Donald 1 165 36

to 1 165 36

this. 1 165 36

Dear 0 166 6
Cardinal 0 166 6
Marx 0 166 6
and 0 166 6
dear 0 166 6
Bishop 0 166 6
Bode, 0 166 6
there 1 166 6
is 1 166 6
only 1 166 6
one 1 166 6
Catholic 1 166 6
answer: 1 166 6
No! 1 166 6

And 0 166 7
your 1 166 7
addition 1 166 7
“in 1 166 7
individual 1 166 7
cases” 1 166 7
is 1 166 7
absolutely 1 166 7
worthless, 1 166 7
it 1 166 7
has 1 166 7
no 1 166 7
argumentative 1 166 7
force. 1 166 7

A 0 166 8
clear 0 166 8
statement 0 166 8
by 0 166 8
Bishop 0 166 8
Andreas 0 166 8
Laun 0 166 8
for 0 166 8
Kath.net. 0 166 8

Cardinal 0 166 9
Marx 0 166 9
and 0 166 9
also 0 166 9
Bishop 0 166 9
Bode 0 166 9
have 0 166 9
now 0 166 9
opened 0 166 9
up 0 166 9
to 0 166 9
the 0 166 9
idea 0 166 9
to 0 166 9
offer 0 166 9
homosexual 0 166 9
couples 0 166 9
a 0 166 9
blessing. 0 166 9

Why 1 166 10
not, 1 166 10
one 1 166 10
could 1 166 10
say, 1 166 10
since 1 166 10
the 1 166 10
Church 1 166 10
is 1 166 10
ready 1 166 10
to 1 166 10
bless 1 166 10
nearly 1 166 10
everything 1 166 10
on 1 166 10
the 1 166 10
earth? 1 166 10

Now, 0 166 11
the 0 166 11
Church 0 166 11
especially 0 166 11
blesses 0 166 11
people, 0 166 11
but 0 166 11
also 0 166 11
deeds 0 166 11
and 0 166 11
objects. 0 166 11

The 0 166 12
Jesuit 0 166 12
Father 0 166 12
Eckhard 0 166 12
Bieger 0 166 12
writes 0 166 12
in 0 166 12
the 0 166 12
Internet 0 166 12
about 0 166 12
Catholic 0 166 12
blessings: 0 166 12

For 0 166 13
Catholics, 0 166 13
really 0 166 13
everything 0 166 13
can 0 166 13
be 0 166 13
blessed, 0 166 13
not 0 166 13
only 0 166 13
places 0 166 13
of 0 166 13
worship, 0 166 13
chalices, 0 166 13
and 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
faithful 0 166 13
after 0 166 13
each 0 166 13
prayer 0 166 13
service 0 166 13
– 0 166 13
whether 0 166 13
after 0 166 13
a 0 166 13
Mass, 0 166 13
or 0 166 13
after 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
prayers 0 166 13
for 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
hours 0 166 13
of 0 166 13
the 0 166 13
day. 0 166 13

The 0 166 14
blessing 0 166 14
is 0 166 14
also 0 166 14
not 0 166 14
limited 0 166 14
to 0 166 14
rosaries 0 166 14
or 0 166 14
religious 0 166 14
medal, 0 166 14
but 0 166 14
one 0 166 14
may 0 166 14
also 0 166 14
bless 0 166 14
cars, 0 166 14
factory 0 166 14
halls, 0 166 14
animals, 0 166 14
herbs, 0 166 14
and 0 166 14
much 0 166 14
more. 0 166 14

Some 0 166 15
blessings 0 166 15
are 0 166 15
only 0 166 15
to 0 166 15
be 0 166 15
made 0 166 15
by 0 166 15
priests 0 166 15
and 0 166 15
deacons, 0 166 15
especially 0 166 15
when 0 166 15
it 0 166 15
is 0 166 15
about 0 166 15
objects 0 166 15
of 0 166 15
worship 0 166 15
such 0 166 15
as 0 166 15
chalices 0 166 15
or 0 166 15
vestments. 0 166 15

But 0 166 16
parents 0 166 16
can 0 166 16
bless 0 166 16
their 0 166 16
children. 0 166 16

The 0 166 17
faithful 0 166 17
may 0 166 17
also 0 166 17
take 0 166 17
home 0 166 17
holy 0 166 17
water 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
sprinkle 0 166 17
it 0 166 17
on 0 166 17
members 0 166 17
of 0 166 17
the 0 166 17
family, 0 166 17
but 0 166 17
also 0 166 17
the 0 166 17
stable 0 166 17
and 0 166 17
the 0 166 17
animals, 0 166 17
thus 0 166 17
blessing 0 166 17
them. 0 166 17

[...] 0 166 18

What 0 166 19
kind 0 166 19
of 0 166 19
hope 0 166 19
is 0 166 19
connected 0 166 19
with 0 166 19
a 0 166 19
blessing? 0 166 19

With 0 166 20
regard 0 166 20
to 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
car, 0 166 20
certainly 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
wish 0 166 20
for 0 166 20
heavenly 0 166 20
protection 0 166 20
– 0 166 20
sometimes 0 166 20
also 0 166 20
expressed 0 166 20
with 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
help 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
a 0 166 20
medal 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
St. 0 166 20
Christopher, 0 166 20
the 0 166 20
patron 0 166 20
saint 0 166 20
of 0 166 20
car 0 166 20
drivers. 0 166 20

With 0 166 21
the 0 166 21
weather 0 166 21
blessing, 0 166 21
one 0 166 21
prays 0 166 21
explicitly 0 166 21
for 0 166 21
protection 0 166 21
against 0 166 21
hail, 0 166 21
lightning 0 166 21
and 0 166 21
drought. 0 166 21

[…] 0 166 22

To 1 166 23
bless 1 166 23
always 1 166 23
means 1 166 23
that 1 166 23
something 1 166 23
shall 1 166 23
flourish, 1 166 23
because 1 166 23
only 1 166 23
then 1 166 23
when 1 166 23
there 1 166 23
is 1 166 23
a 1 166 23
blessing 1 166 23
upon 1 166 23
a 1 166 23
cause 1 166 23
or 1 166 23
a 1 166 23
project, 1 166 23
will 1 166 23
something 1 166 23
good 1 166 23
come 1 166 23
out 1 166 23
of 1 166 23
it. 1 166 23

The 0 166 24
blessing 0 166 24
comes 0 166 24
from 0 166 24
God, 0 166 24
He 0 166 24
is 0 166 24
being 0 166 24
addressed 0 166 24
in 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
form 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
a 0 166 24
request; 0 166 24
and 0 166 24
it 0 166 24
is 0 166 24
given 0 166 24
to 0 166 24
people, 0 166 24
objects, 0 166 24
and 0 166 24
buildings, 0 166 24
with 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
help 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
sign 0 166 24
of 0 166 24
the 0 166 24
cross, 0 166 24
holy 0 166 24
water, 0 166 24
and 0 166 24
incense. 0 166 24

[…] 0 166 25

But 0 166 26
now 0 166 26
concerning 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
question 0 166 26
of 0 166 26
Cardinal 0 166 26
Marx, 0 166 26
and 0 166 26
not 0 166 26
a 0 166 26
few 0 166 26
of 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
priests, 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
answer 0 166 26
is 0 166 26
simple: 0 166 26
one 0 166 26
may 0 166 26
ask 0 166 26
for 0 166 26
God's 0 166 26
blessing 0 166 26
for 0 166 26
sinners, 0 166 26
but 0 166 26
not 0 166 26
for 0 166 26
the 0 166 26
sin. 0 166 26

That 1 166 27
is 1 166 27
to 1 166 27
say, 1 166 27
one 1 166 27
could 1 166 27
not 1 166 27
consecrate 1 166 27
a 1 166 27
brothel, 1 166 27
one 1 166 27
could 1 166 27
not 1 166 27
bless 1 166 27
a 1 166 27
concentration 1 166 27
camp 1 166 27
or 1 166 27
weapons 1 166 27
which 1 166 27
are 1 166 27
not 1 166 27
explicitly 1 166 27
ordained 1 166 27
for 1 166 27
hunting 1 166 27
or 1 166 27
for 1 166 27
legitimate 1 166 27
self-defense. 1 166 27

Therefore 0 166 28
it 0 166 28
is 0 166 28
clear 0 166 28
that 0 166 28
one 1 166 28
may 1 166 28
not 1 166 28
bless 1 166 28
a 1 166 28
relationship 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
is 1 166 28
sinful; 1 166 28
[one 1 166 28
may 1 166 28
not 1 166 28
bless] 1 166 28
the 1 166 28
mafia; 1 166 28
no 1 166 28
blessing 1 166 28
for 1 166 28
organizations 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
institutions 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
promote 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
procure 1 166 28
abortions 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
propagate 1 166 28
ideologies 1 166 28
which 1 166 28
are 1 166 28
against 1 166 28
the 1 166 28
Faith, 1 166 28
antisemitic 1 166 28
contents, 1 166 28
or 1 166 28
other 1 166 28
forms 1 166 28
of 1 166 28
racist 1 166 28
thought. 1 166 28

If 1 166 29
one 1 166 29
considers 1 166 29
and 1 166 29
weighs 1 166 29
this 1 166 29
matter, 1 166 29
one 1 166 29
knows: 1 166 29
one 1 166 29
may 1 166 29
not 1 166 29
bless 1 166 29
a 1 166 29
union 1 166 29
of 1 166 29
two 1 166 29
homosexual 1 166 29
men 1 166 29
or 1 166 29
of 1 166 29
lesbian 1 166 29
women. 1 166 29

Of 0 166 30
course 0 166 30
[one 0 166 30
could 0 166 30
bless] 0 166 30
two 0 166 30
men 0 166 30
or 0 166 30
women 0 166 30
who 0 166 30
are 0 166 30
de 0 166 30
facto 0 166 30
homosexual, 0 166 30
and 0 166 30
that 0 166 30
it 0 166 30
what 0 166 30
happens 0 166 30
in 0 166 30
each 0 166 30
Holy 0 166 30
Mass 0 166 30
which 0 166 30
is 0 166 30
being 0 166 30
attended 0 166 30
by 0 166 30
them. 0 166 30

This 0 166 31
blessing 0 166 31
– 0 166 31
which 0 166 31
is 0 166 31
not 0 166 31
related 0 166 31
to 0 166 31
their 0 166 31
acts 0 166 31
– 0 166 31
is 0 166 31
being 0 166 31
received 0 166 31
also 0 166 31
by 0 166 31
all 0 166 31
the 0 166 31
other 0 166 31
sinners, 0 166 31
and 0 166 31
the 0 166 31
Church 0 166 31
thereby 0 166 31
hopes 0 166 31
that 0 166 31
they 0 166 31
will 0 166 31
convert 0 166 31
under 0 166 31
the 0 166 31
influence 0 166 31
of 0 166 31
God's 0 166 31
Grace! 0 166 31

This 1 166 32
position 1 166 32
which 1 166 32
is 1 166 32
really 1 166 32
simple 1 166 32
and 1 166 32
easily 1 166 32
to 1 166 32
be 1 166 32
understood 1 166 32
has 0 166 32
been 0 166 32
clearly 0 166 32
and 0 166 32
convincingly 0 166 32
presented 0 166 32
– 0 166 32
since 0 166 32
the 0 166 32
statement 0 166 32
of 0 166 32
the 0 166 32
two 0 166 32
bishops 0 166 32
[Marx 0 166 32
and 0 166 32
Bode] 0 166 32
– 0 166 32

Dear 1 166 34
Cardinal 1 166 34
Marx 1 166 34
and 1 166 34
dear 1 166 34
Bishop 1 166 34
Bode, 1 166 34
there 1 166 34
is 1 166 34
only 1 166 34
one 1 166 34
Catholic 1 166 34
answer: 1 166 34
No! 1 166 34

And 1 166 35
your 1 166 35
addition 1 166 35
“in 1 166 35
individual 1 166 35
cases” 1 166 35
is 1 166 35
absolutely 1 166 35
worthless, 1 166 35
it 1 166 35
has 1 166 35
no 1 166 35
argumentative 1 166 35
force. 1 166 35

What 0 166 36
would 0 166 36
St. 0 166 36
John 0 166 36
the 0 166 36
Baptist 0 166 36
have 0 166 36
said 0 166 36
if 0 166 36
Herod, 0 166 36
taking 0 166 36
for 0 166 36
himself 0 166 36
his 0 166 36
brother's 0 166 36
wife, 0 166 36
would 0 166 36
have 0 166 36
excusingly 0 166 36
called 0 166 36
himself 0 166 36
an 0 166 36
“individual 0 166 36
case”! 0 166 36

The 0 166 37
idea 0 166 37
to 0 166 37
bless 0 166 37
sinful 0 166 37
conduct 0 166 37
is 0 166 37
really 0 166 37
what 0 166 37
Isaiah 0 166 37
described 0 166 37
quite 0 166 37
vividly, 0 166 37
as 0 166 37
follows: 0 166 37
“Woe 0 166 37
to 0 166 37
you 0 166 37
that 0 166 37
call 0 166 37
evil 0 166 37
good, 0 166 37
and 0 166 37
good 0 166 37
evil: 0 166 37
that 0 166 37
put 0 166 37
darkness 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
light, 0 166 37
and 0 166 37
light 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
darkness: 0 166 37
that 0 166 37
put 0 166 37
bitter 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
sweet, 0 166 37
and 0 166 37
sweet 0 166 37
for 0 166 37
bitter.” 0 166 37
[Isaiah 0 166 37
5:20] 0 166 37

Is 0 166 38
this 0 166 38
not 0 166 38
exactly 0 166 38
what 0 166 38
Cardinal 0 166 38
Marx 0 166 38
– 0 166 38
and 0 166 38
others 0 166 38
who 0 166 38
are 0 166 38
thinking 0 166 38
like 0 166 38
him 0 166 38
– 0 166 38
are 0 166 38
doing? 0 166 38

If 0 166 39
one 0 166 39
were 0 166 39
to 0 166 39
place 0 166 39
on 0 166 39
a 0 166 39
bottle 0 166 39
of 0 166 39
sour 0 166 39
cucumbers 0 166 39
a 0 166 39
tag 0 166 39
“honey,” 0 166 39
the 0 166 39
cucumbers 0 166 39
still 0 166 39
remain 0 166 39
sour! 0 166 39

Even 0 166 40
blessing 0 166 40
bishops 0 166 40
cannot 0 166 40
change 0 166 40
that. 0 166 40

Nor 0 166 41
can 0 166 41
the 0 166 41
pope, 0 166 41
in 0 166 41
calling 0 166 41
for 0 166 41
a 0 166 41
cultural 0 166 41
revolution, 0 166 41
especially 0 166 41
since 0 166 41
he 0 166 41
does 0 166 41
not 0 166 41
explain 0 166 41
what 0 166 41
he 0 166 41
exactly 0 166 41
means 0 166 41
by 0 166 41
it. 0 166 41

He 0 166 42
says 0 166 42
that 0 166 42
he 0 166 42
“allows 0 166 42
himself” 0 166 42
to 0 166 42
talk 0 166 42
like 0 166 42
that 0 166 42
– 0 166 42
but 1 166 42
if 1 166 42
one 1 166 42
dares 1 166 42
something, 1 166 42
one 1 166 42
might 1 166 42
win, 1 166 42
but 1 166 42
one 1 166 42
also 1 166 42
can 1 166 42
perish. 1 166 42

That 0 166 43
seems 0 166 43
to 0 166 43
catch 0 166 43
on 0 166 43
these 0 166 43
days. 0 166 43

For 0 166 44
example, 0 166 44
the 0 166 44
Italian 0 166 44
moral 0 166 44
theologian, 0 166 44
Maurizio 0 166 44
Chiodi, 0 166 44
recently 0 166 44
claimed 0 166 44
in 0 166 44
his 0 166 44
talk 0 166 44
at 0 166 44
the 0 166 44
Gregorian 0 166 44
Pontifical 0 166 44
University 0 166 44
that 0 166 44
contraception 0 166 44
is 0 166 44
sometimes 0 166 44
not 0 166 44
only 0 166 44
not 0 166 44
forbidden, 0 166 44
but 0 166 44
even 0 166 44
demanded! 0 166 44

To 1 166 45
contradict 1 166 45
two 1 166 45
popes 1 166 45
– 1 166 45
whom 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
Church 1 166 45
has 1 166 45
already 1 166 45
“beatified” 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
one 1 166 45
and 1 166 45
“canonized” 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
other 1 166 45
– 1 166 45
so 1 166 45
shortly 1 166 45
after 1 166 45
their 1 166 45
deaths, 1 166 45
and 1 166 45
in 1 166 45
such 1 166 45
a 1 166 45
radical 1 166 45
and 1 166 45
open 1 166 45
manner, 1 166 45
probably 1 166 45
has 1 166 45
never 1 166 45
happened 1 166 45
before 1 166 45
in 1 166 45
the 1 166 45
Church's 1 166 45
history. 1 166 45

Isaiah 1 166 46
says 1 166 46
that 1 166 46
such 1 166 46
people 1 166 46
draw 1 166 46
unto 1 166 46
them 1 166 46
God's 1 166 46
punishment, 1 166 46
with 1 166 46
thick 1 166 46
cords! 1 166 46

Nevertheless, 0 166 47
one 0 166 47
should 0 166 47
wish 0 166 47
for 0 166 47
Cardinal 0 166 47
Marx, 0 166 47
Bishop 0 166 47
Bode, 0 166 47
and 0 166 47
Professor 0 166 47
Chiodi 0 166 47
that 0 166 47
they 0 166 47
sleep 0 166 47
well. 0 166 47

Whether 0 166 47

their 0 166 47

conscience 0 166 47

will 0 166 47

allow 0 166 47

it, 0 166 47

is 0 166 47

not 0 166 47

if 0 166 47

it 0 166 47

does 0 166 47

not 0 166 47

[allow 0 166 47

it], 0 166 47

it 0 166 47

would 0 166 47

be 0 166 47

a 0 166 47

In 0 170 31
astronomy, 0 170 31
a 0 170 31
light-year 0 170 31
is 0 170 31
a 0 170 31
commonly 0 170 31
used 0 170 31
unit 0 170 31
to 0 170 31
measure 0 170 31
distance, 0 170 31
but 0 170 31
some 0 170 31
astronomers 0 170 31
prefer 0 170 31
to 0 170 31
use 0 170 31
a 0 170 31
unit 0 170 31
called 0 170 31
the 0 170 31
parsec. 0 170 31

When 0 170 32
referring 0 170 32
to 0 170 32
something 0 170 32
larger, 0 170 32
they 0 170 32
use 0 170 32
kiloparsecs, 0 170 32
which 0 170 32
are 0 170 32
equal 0 170 32
to 0 170 32
1,000 0 170 32

This 0 170 34

seem 0 170 34

it 0 170 34

220,000 0 170 35
light 0 170 35
years, 0 170 35
which 0 170 35
is 0 170 35

the 0 170 37

that 0 173 37

They 0 173 41

on 0 175 7
external 0 175 7

Those 0 175 8
conflicts, 0 175 8
mostly 0 175 8
centred 0 175 8
on 0 175 8

of 1 175 8

"Christianity 1 175 9
is 1 175 9
Europe's 1 175 9
last 1 175 9
hope," 1 175 9
Orban 0 175 9

"our 1 175 10
worst 1 175 10
nightmares 1 175 10

come 1 175 10

The 1 175 11
West 1 175 11

as 1 175 11
it 1 175 11
fails 1 175 11
to 1 175 11
see 1 175 11
Europe 1 175 11
being 1 175 11
overrun." 1 175 11

Orban 0 175 12
is 0 175 12
widely 0 175 12
credited 0 175 12
for 0 175 12
reversing 0 175 12
an 0 175 12
economic 0 175 12
slump 0 175 12
in 0 175 12
Hungary 0 175 12
and 0 175 12
controlling 0 175 12
its 0 175 12
public 0 175 12
finances, 0 175 12
culminating 0 175 12
in 0 175 12
a 0 175 12
return 0 175 12
to 0 175 12
investment-grade 0 175 12
for 0 175 12
its 0 175 12
debt, 0 175 12
which 0 175 12
was 0 175 12
cut 0 175 12
to 0 175 12
'junk' 0 175 12
during 0 175 12
the 0 175 12
2008 0 175 12

To 0 175 13
achieve 0 175 13
that 0 175 13
and 0 175 13
hold 0 175 13
onto 0 175 13
power 0 175 13
the 0 175 13
prime 0 175 13
minister, 0 175 13
54, 0 175 13
has 0 175 13
used 0 175 13
methods 0 175 13
that 0 175 13
critics 0 175 13
have 0 175 13
called 0 175 13
authoritarian, 0 175 13
and 0 175 13
picked 0 175 13
fights 0 175 13
with 0 175 13
EU 0 175 13
partners, 0 175 13
especially 0 175 13
in 0 175 13
the 0 175 13
West. 0 175 13

Eastern 0 175 14
leaders, 0 175 14
most 0 175 14
notably 0 175 14
in 0 175 14
Poland, 0 175 14
have 0 175 14
followed 0 175 14
his 0 175 14
lead. 0 175 14

But 0 175 15
migration 0 175 15
dominates 0 175 15
his 0 175 15
agenda 0 175 15
now. 0 175 15

Orban 0 175 16
said 0 175 16
on 0 175 16
Sunday 0 175 16
that 0 175 16
Europe 0 175 16
faces 0 175 16
a 0 175 16
critical 0 175 16
fissure 0 175 16
between 0 175 16
nation 0 175 16
states 0 175 16
of 0 175 16
the 0 175 16
East 0 175 16
and 0 175 16
the 0 175 16
West, 0 175 16
which 0 175 16
he 0 175 16
called 0 175 16
an 0 175 16
"immigrant 0 175 16
zone, 0 175 16
a 0 175 16
mixed 0 175 16
population 0 175 16
world 0 175 16
that 0 175 16
heads 0 175 16
in 0 175 16
a 1 175 16
direction 1 175 16
different 1 175 16
from 1 175 16
ours". 1 175 16

As 0 175 17
the 0 175 17
West 0 175 17
wants 0 175 17
eastern 0 175 17
Europe 0 175 17
to 0 175 17
follow 0 175 17
its 0 175 17
lead, 0 175 17
an 0 175 17
increasingly 1 175 17
vicious 1 175 17
struggle 1 175 17
was 0 175 17
likely, 0 175 17
he 0 175 17

“The 0 177 8
commission’s 0 177 8

Why 0 177 9
is 0 177 9
it 0 177 9

What 0 177 13
did 0 177 13
the 0 177 13
first 0 177 13
commission 0 177 13
achieve? 0 177 13

The 0 177 14
Vatican 0 177 14
has 0 177 14
said 0 177 14
it 0 177 14
“worked 0 177 14
with 0 177 14
almost 0 177 14
200 0 177 14
dioceses 0 177 14

institutions.” 0 177 14

What 0 177 15
didn’t 0 177 15
it 0 177 15
do? 0 177 15

Commission 0 177 16
members 0 177 16
quickly 0 177 16
realized 0 177 16
they 0 177 16
needed 0 177 16
to 0 177 16
go 0 177 16
beyond 0 177 16
raising 0 177 16
awareness 0 177 16
and 0 177 16
deal 0 177 16
with 0 177 16
the 0 177 16
bishops 0 177 16
who 0 177 16
quietly 0 177 16
shift 0 177 16
offenders 0 177 16
to 0 177 16
new 0 177 16
dioceses 0 177 16
when 0 177 16
they 0 177 16
are 0 177 16
exposed 0 177 16
as 0 177 16
molesters 0 177 16
and 0 177 16
rapists. 0 177 16

Even 0 177 17
if 0 177 17
church 0 177 17
laws 0 177 17
already 0 177 17
existed 0 177 17
to 0 177 17
hold 0 177 17
bishops 0 177 17
accountable 0 177 17
for 0 177 17
their 0 177 17
priests’ 0 177 17
behavior, 0 177 17
those 0 177 17
strictures 0 177 17
were 0 177 17
not 0 177 17
enough, 0 177 17
O’Malley 0 177 17
said 0 177 17
in 0 177 17
2014. 0 177 17

“There 0 177 18
are, 0 177 18
theoretically 0 177 18
I 0 177 18
guess, 0 177 18
canons 0 177 18
that 0 177 18
could 0 177 18
apply 0 177 18
here, 0 177 18
but 0 177 18
obviously 0 177 18
they 0 177 18
have 0 177 18
not 0 177 18
been 0 177 18
sufficient,” 0 177 18
he 0 177 18
said. 0 177 18

The 0 177 19
commission 0 177 19
was 0 177 19
behind 0 177 19
Francis’ 0 177 19
decision 0 177 19
in 0 177 19
2015 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
create 0 177 19
a 0 177 19
new 0 177 19
tribunal 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
judge 0 177 19
bishops 0 177 19
caught 0 177 19
covering 0 177 19
up 0 177 19
for 0 177 19
abusive 1 177 19
priests, 1 177 19
and 0 177 19
to 0 177 19
fund 0 177 19
it 0 177 19
for 0 177 19
five 0 177 19
years. 0 177 19

But 0 177 20
amid 0 177 20
myriad 0 177 20
legal 0 177 20
questions 0 177 20
over 0 177 20
what 0 177 20
exact 0 177 20
powers 0 177 20
the 0 177 20
court 0 177 20
would 0 177 20
have, 0 177 20
it 0 177 20
never 0 177 20
got 0 177 20
off 0 177 20
the 0 177 20
ground. 0 177 20

In 0 177 21
2016, 0 177 21
Francis 0 177 21
officially 0 177 21
killed 0 177 21
the 0 177 21
plan 0 177 21
to 0 177 21
create 0 177 21
it, 0 177 21
issuing 0 177 21
a 0 177 21
document 0 177 21
that 0 177 21
essentially 0 177 21
called 0 177 21
on 0 177 21
using 0 177 21
existing 0 177 21
procedures 0 177 21
to 0 177 21
tackle 0 177 21
the 0 177 21
problem. 0 177 21

Francis 0 177 22
was 0 177 22
also 0 177 22
criticized 0 177 22
when 0 177 22
Australian 0 177 22
Cardinal 0 177 22
George 0 177 22
Pell, 0 177 22
whom 0 177 22
he 0 177 22
had 0 177 22
brought 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
Rome 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
clean 0 177 22
up 0 177 22
Vatican 0 177 22
finances, 0 177 22
was 0 177 22
forced 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
return 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
Australia 0 177 22
last 0 177 22
year 0 177 22
to 0 177 22
face 0 177 22
charges 0 177 22
of 0 177 22
sexual 0 177 22
assault. 0 177 22

Any 0 177 23
other 0 177 23
problems? 0 177 23

Commission 0 177 24
members 0 177 24
said 0 177 24
bishops 0 177 24
should 0 177 24
call 0 177 24
the 0 177 24
police 0 177 24
when 0 177 24
they 0 177 24
discovered 0 177 24
predator 1 177 24
priests, 1 177 24
rather 0 177 24
than 0 177 24
phone 0 177 24
the 0 177 24
nearest 0 177 24
religious 0 177 24
retreat 0 177 24
to 0 177 24
“park” 1 177 24
the 1 177 24
priest 1 177 24
out 1 177 24
of 1 177 24
harm’s 1 177 24
way. 1 177 24

But 0 177 25
this 0 177 25
simple 0 177 25
message 0 177 25
was 0 177 25
hard 0 177 25
to 0 177 25
get 0 177 25
across. 0 177 25

It 0 177 26
emerged 0 177 26
that 0 177 26
during 0 177 26
a 0 177 26
Vatican 0 177 26
training 0 177 26
course 0 177 26
for 0 177 26
new 0 177 26
bishops 0 177 26
in 0 177 26
September 0 177 26
2015 0 177 26
a 0 177 26
French 0 177 26
priest 0 177 26
informed 0 177 26
bishops 0 177 26
they 0 177 26
had 0 177 26
no 0 177 26
obligation 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
report 0 177 26
abuse 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
the 0 177 26
police, 0 177 26
forcing 0 177 26
the 0 177 26
commission 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
issue 0 177 26
a 0 177 26
strong 0 177 26
statement 0 177 26
saying 0 177 26
bishops 0 177 26
had 0 177 26
every 0 177 26
obligation 0 177 26
to 0 177 26
do 0 177 26
so. 0 177 26

Did 0 177 27
commission 0 177 27
members 0 177 27
persevere? 0 177 27

Not 0 177 28
all 0 177 28
of 0 177 28
them. 0 177 28

British 0 177 29

ousted 0 177 29
in 0 177 29
2016. 0 177 29

He 0 177 30
said 0 177 30
the 0 177 30
group 0 177 30
was 0 177 30
a 0 177 30
toothless, 1 177 30
paper-shuffling 1 177 30
exercise. 1 177 30

in 0 177 31
March 0 177 31
last 0 177 31
year 0 177 31
and 0 177 31
said 0 177 31
Vatican 0 177 31

not. 0 177 35

In 0 177 36
2015, 0 177 36

stuck 0 177 38
by 0 177 38

dismissing 0 177 38
the 0 177 38

That 0 177 40
was 0 177 40
too 0 177 40
much 0 177 40
for 0 177 40
O’Malley, 0 177 40
who 0 177 40
said 0 177 40
Francis 0 177 40
had 1 177 40
caused 1 177 40
"great 1 177 40
pain” 1 177 40
to 1 177 40
victims. 1 177 40

If 1 177 41
Francis 1 177 41
was 1 177 41
not 1 177 41
listening 1 177 41
to 1 177 41
the 1 177 41
commission 1 177 41
about 1 177 41
Barros, 1 177 41
whom 1 177 41
was 1 177 41
he 1 177 41
listening 1 177 41
to? 1 177 41

Vatican 0 177 42
watchers 0 177 42
believe 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
pope 0 177 42
was 0 177 42
influenced 0 177 42
by 0 177 42
Chilean 0 177 42
Cardinal 0 177 42
Francisco 0 177 42
Javier 0 177 42
Errazuriz, 0 177 42
a 0 177 42
member 0 177 42
of 0 177 42
the 0 177 42
G9 0 177 42
group 0 177 42
who 0 177 42
has 0 177 42
backed 0 177 42
Barros 0 177 42
and 0 177 42
reportedly 0 177 42
helped 0 177 42
block 0 177 42
moves 0 177 42

So 0 177 43
is 0 177 43
the 0 177 43
pope 0 177 43
intransigent 0 177 43
on 0 177 43

No. 0 177 44

much 1 182 16

it 0 182 17
ain’t 0 182 17

The 1 182 18
people 1 182 18
who 1 182 18
talk 1 182 18
about 1 182 18
the 1 182 18

are 1 182 18
generally 1 182 18
anti-Semites. 1 182 18

Somehow 0 182 19
I 0 182 19
don't 0 182 19
think 0 182 19
a 0 182 19
white 0 182 19

would 0 182 19
get 0 182 19
away 0 182 19

David 0 182 19
Duke 0 182 19
on 0 182 19
the 0 182 19

isn't 0 182 19
especially 0 182 19
concerned 0 182 19
about 0 182 19
his 0 182 19
racism. 0 182 19

But 0 182 20
black 0 182 20
leaders 0 182 20
have 0 182 20
gotten 0 182 20
away 0 182 20
with 0 182 20
playing 0 182 20
that 0 182 20
game 0 182 20
with 0 182 20

repeatedly. 0 182 20

the 0 182 21
ADL 0 182 21
and 0 182 21
the 0 182 21

if 1 182 21

they 1 182 21

can't 1 182 21

“I 0 361 16

But 0 361 18
experts 0 361 18
say 0 361 18
this 0 361 18
is 0 361 18
not 0 361 18
true. 0 361 18

As 0 361 19
WFAA 0 361 19
reports, 0 361 19
Justin 0 361 19
Moore, 0 361 19
a 0 361 19
civil 0 361 19
rights 0 361 19
attorney 0 361 19
was 0 361 19
a 0 361 19
panelist 0 361 19
at 0 361 19
the 0 361 19
meeting 0 361 19
and 0 361 19
was 0 361 19
surprised 0 361 19
by 0 361 19
the 0 361 19
Chief’s 0 361 19
comments. 0 361 19

“I 0 361 20
was 0 361 20
completely 0 361 20
mystified, 0 361 20
and 0 361 20
I 0 361 20
really 0 361 20
didn’t 0 361 20
understand 0 361 20
where 0 361 20
it 0 361 20
came 0 361 20
from 0 361 20
last 0 361 20
night. 0 361 20

It 0 361 21
seemed 0 361 21
like 0 361 21
Chief 1 361 21
Hall 1 361 21
might 1 361 21
not 1 361 21
have 1 361 21
been 1 361 21
well 1 361 21
informed 1 361 21
on 1 361 21
the 1 361 21
law,” 1 361 21
said 0 361 21
Moore. 0 361 21

WFAA 0 361 22
went 0 361 22
further 0 361 22
and 0 361 22
noted 0 361 22
that 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
“the 0 361 22
Dallas 0 361 22
Police 0 361 22
Department 0 361 22
general 0 361 22
orders 0 361 22
do 0 361 22
allow 0 361 22
the 0 361 22
chief 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
take 0 361 22
action, 0 361 22
saying, 0 361 22
‘The 0 361 22
Chief 0 361 22
of 0 361 22
Police 0 361 22
may 0 361 22
circumvent 0 361 22
all 0 361 22
formal 0 361 22
disciplinary 0 361 22
procedures 0 361 22
to 0 361 22
render 0 361 22
an 0 361 22
immediate 0 361 22
decision 0 361 22
when 0 361 22
it 0 361 22
deems 0 361 22
it 0 361 22
necessary 0 361 22
to 0 361 22

the 0 361 22
integrity 0 361 22
of 0 361 22

Apparently, 0 361 23
this 0 361 23
“integrity” 0 361 23
is 0 361 23
not 0 361 23
worth 0 361 23
preserving 0 361 23
and 0 361 23
the 0 361 23
Dallas 0 361 23

going 0 361 23
out 0 361 23

on 0 361 23
their 0 361 23
payroll. 0 361 23

As 0 361 24
WFAA 0 361 24
pointed 0 361 24
out, 0 361 24
lots 0 361 24
of 0 361 24
cops 0 361 24
across 0 361 24

been 0 361 24
fired 0 361 24
by 0 361 24
police 0 361 24
chiefs. 0 361 24

This 0 361 25
includes 0 361 25
cops 0 361 25
within 0 361 25
the 0 361 25
Dallas 0 361 25
police 0 361 25
department. 0 361 25

Amy 0 361 26
Wilburn, 0 361 26
a 0 361 26
former 0 361 26
Dallas 1 361 26
cop 1 361 26
shot 1 361 26
an 1 361 26
unarmed 1 361 26
teen 1 361 26
in 0 361 26
the 0 361 26

sat 0 361 26
down 0 361 26

his 0 361 26
hands 0 361 26
in 0 361 26
the 0 361 26

in 0 361 26
2013. 0 361 26

Days 0 361 27
later, 0 361 27
after 0 361 27
her 0 361 27
account 0 361 27
was 0 361 27
found 0 361 27
to 0 361 27
be 0 361 27
entirely 0 361 27
false, 0 361 27
she 0 361 27
was 0 361 27
fired 0 361 27
for 0 361 27
it. 0 361 27

Wilburn 0 361 28
became 0 361 28
the 0 361 28
first 0 361 28
cop 0 361 28
in 0 361 28
41 0 361 28
years 0 361 28
— 0 361 28
since 0 361 28
officer 1 361 28
Darrell 1 361 28
Cain 1 361 28
murdered 1 361 28
a 1 361 28
12-year-old 1 361 28
boy 1 361 28
in 0 361 28
the 0 361 28
back 0 361 28
of 0 361 28
his 0 361 28
squad 0 361 28
car 0 361 28
— 0 361 28
to 0 361 28
be 0 361 28
indicted 0 361 28
for 0 361 28
shooting 0 361 28
a 0 361 28
suspect. 0 361 28

Also 0 361 29
in 0 361 29
2013, 0 361 29
officer 1 361 29
Cardan 1 361 29
Spencer 1 361 29
shot 1 361 29
a 1 361 29
mentally 1 361 29
ill 1 361 29
man 1 361 29
in 0 361 29
his 0 361 29
driveway. 0 361 29

Days 0 361 30
later, 0 361 30
he 0 361 30
was 0 361 30
also 0 361 30
fired 0 361 30
after 0 361 30
surveillance 0 361 30
video 0 361 30
proved 0 361 30
he 0 361 30
was 0 361 30
lying 0 361 30
about 0 361 30
what 0 361 30
happened. 0 361 30

So 0 361 31
why 0 361 31
hasn’t 0 361 31
the 0 361 31
chief 0 361 31
fired 0 361 31
Gugyer, 0 361 31
who 0 361 31
has 0 361 31
actually 0 361 31
been 0 361 31
charged, 0 361 31
arrested, 0 361 31
and 0 361 31
admitted 0 361 31
to 0 361 31
killing 0 361 31
an 0 361 31
innocent 1 361 31
man? 0 361 31

Like 0 361 32
all 0 361 32
those 0 361 32
accused 0 361 32
of 0 361 32
a 0 361 32
crime, 0 361 32
Amber 0 361 32
Guyger 0 361 32
deserves 0 361 32
her 0 361 32
day 0 361 32
in 0 361 32
court. 0 361 32

However, 0 361 33
as 0 361 33
far 0 361 33
as 0 361 33
her 0 361 33
job 0 361 33
with 0 361 33
the 0 361 33
department 0 361 33
is 0 361 33
concerned, 0 361 33
she 0 361 33
has 0 361 33
already 0 361 33
proven 0 361 33
that 0 361 33
she 0 361 33
is 0 361 33
no 0 361 33
longer 0 361 33
fit 0 361 33
for 0 361 33
duty, 0 361 33
ever 0 361 33
again. 0 361 33

WFAA 0 361 34
asked 0 361 34
the 0 361 34
Dallas 0 361 34
Police 0 361 34
Department 0 361 34
for 0 361 34
the 0 361 34
laws 0 361 34
she 0 361 34
cited 0 361 34
claiming 0 361 34
that 0 361 34
she 0 361 34
can’t 0 361 34
fire 0 361 34
Guyger, 0 361 34
but 0 361 34
they 0 361 34
did 0 361 34
not 0 361 34
provide 0 361 34
them. 0 361 34

The 0 361 35
department 0 361 35
did 0 361 35
respond 0 361 35
about 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
general 0 361 35
order 0 361 35
mentioned 0 361 35
by 0 361 35
WFAA, 0 361 35
however, 0 361 35
saying, 0 361 35
“General 0 361 35
order 0 361 35
508 0 361 35
refers 0 361 35
to 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
Police 0 361 35
Chief’s 0 361 35
ability 0 361 35
to 0 361 35
circumvent 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
formal 0 361 35
disciplinary 0 361 35
procedures 0 361 35
not 0 361 35
the 0 361 35
investigative 0 361 35
process.” 0 361 35

Exactly 0 361 36
what 0 361 36
“investigative 0 361 36
process” 0 361 36
needs 0 361 36
to 0 361 36
happen 0 361 36
before 0 361 36
they 0 361 36
can 0 361 36
fire 0 361 36
her 0 361 36
remains 0 361 36
unclear 0 361 36
as 0 361 36
this 0 361 36
public 0 361 36
servant 0 361 36
admitted 0 361 36
to 0 361 36
killing 0 361 36
an 0 361 36
innocent 1 361 36
man 0 361 36
in 0 361 36
his 0 361 36
own 0 361 36
home. 0 361 36

At 0 361 37
the 0 361 37
very 0 361 37
least, 0 361 37
she 0 361 37
should 0 361 37
be 0 361 37
fired 0 361 37
for 0 361 37
this. 0 361 37

But 0 361 38
then 0 361 38
again, 0 361 38
as 0 361 38
we’ve 0 361 38
reported 0 361 38

Amber 0 361 38

"Since 0 362 33

justice 0 362 33

I 1 362 34
fear 1 362 34

this 1 362 34

She 0 362 36
continued. 0 362 36

"I 0 362 37
worry 1 362 37
about 1 362 37
this 1 362 37
country. 1 362 37

I 0 362 38
don't 0 362 38

Hannity 0 362 41

"Why 0 362 41

Gregg 0 362 42
Jarrett 0 362 42
says 0 362 42
it's 0 362 42
"because 0 362 42

point 0 362 42
where 0 362 42
they've 0 362 42
lost 0 362 42
their 0 362 42
common 0 362 42
sense." 0 362 42

Their 0 362 43
commentary 0 362 43
on 0 362 43
the 0 362 43
video 0 362 43
below 0 362 43
is 0 362 43
interesting. 0 362 43

Sen. 0 362 44
Charles 0 362 44
Grassley 0 362 44
(R-IA) 0 362 44
is 0 362 44
to 0 362 44
be 0 362 44
commended 0 362 44
on 0 362 44
his 0 362 44
handling 0 362 44
of 0 362 44
the 0 362 44
situation. 0 362 44

In 0 362 45
the 0 362 45
spirit 0 362 45
of 0 362 45
compromise, 0 362 45
he 0 362 45
called 0 362 45
off 0 362 45
the 0 362 45
Senate 0 362 45
committee 0 362 45
vote 0 362 45
that 0 362 45
had 0 362 45
been 0 362 45
on 0 362 45
the 0 362 45
calendar 0 362 45
for 0 362 45
Thursday 0 362 45
and 0 362 45
scheduled 0 362 45
a 0 362 45
hearing 0 362 45
for 0 362 45
next 0 362 45
Monday 0 362 45
so 0 362 45
that 0 362 45
both 0 362 45
Christine 0 362 45
Ford 0 362 45
and 0 362 45
Brett 0 362 45
Kavanaugh 0 362 45
could 0 362 45
state 0 362 45
their 0 362 45
cases. 0 362 45

Kavanaugh 0 362 46
immediately 0 362 46
responded 0 362 46
to 0 362 46
Grassley. 0 362 46

For 0 362 47
36 0 362 47
hours, 0 362 47
there 0 362 47
was 0 362 47
silence 0 362 47
from 0 362 47
the 0 362 47
Ford 0 362 47
camp. 0 362 47

Then, 0 362 48
their 0 362 48
demands 0 362 48
began. 0 362 48

First, 0 362 49
it 0 362 49
was 0 362 49
reported 0 362 49
that 0 362 49
Ford 0 362 49
would 0 362 49
answer 0 362 49
questions, 0 362 49
but 0 362 49
only 0 362 49
at 0 362 49
a 0 362 49
closed 0 362 49
hearing 0 362 49
and 0 362 49
only 0 362 49
after 0 362 49
an 0 362 49
FBI 0 362 49
investigation 0 362 49
had 0 362 49
been 0 362 49
completed. 0 362 49

Republicans 0 362 50
felt 0 362 50
that 0 362 50
the 0 362 50
request 0 362 50
for 0 362 50
a 0 362 50
closed 0 362 50
hearing 0 362 50
was 0 362 50
reasonable, 0 362 50
but 0 362 50
the 0 362 50
demand 0 362 50
for 0 362 50
a 0 362 50
new 0 362 50
FBI 0 362 50
investigation 0 362 50
was 0 362 50
not. 0 362 50

The 0 362 51
FBI 0 362 51
investigates 0 362 51
federal 0 362 51
crimes 0 362 51
and/or 0 362 51
national 0 362 51
security 0 362 51
issues. 0 362 51

When 0 362 52
the 0 362 52
FBI 0 362 52
received 0 362 52
Dianne 0 362 52
Feinstein’s 0 362 52
letter 0 362 52
last 0 362 52
week, 0 362 52
they 0 362 52
forwarded 0 362 52
it 0 362 52
to 0 362 52
the 0 362 52
White 0 362 52
House 0 362 52
to 0 362 52
place 0 362 52
in 0 362 52
Kavanaugh’s 0 362 52
background 0 362 52
check 0 362 52
file. 0 362 52

(Note: 0 362 53
The 0 362 53
FBI 0 362 53
has 0 362 53
already 0 362 53
conducted 0 362 53
six 0 362 53
background 0 362 53
checks 0 362 53
on 0 362 53
Kavanaugh, 0 362 53
the 0 362 53
most 0 362 53
recent 0 362 53
one 0 362 53
was 0 362 53
done 0 362 53
this 0 362 53
summer.) 0 362 53

It 0 362 54
was 0 362 54
announced 0 362 54
later 0 362 54
that 0 362 54
Sen. 0 362 54
Grassley 0 362 54
would 0 362 54
not 0 362 54
change 0 362 54
the 0 362 54
date 0 362 54
of 0 362 54
the 0 362 54
hearing 0 362 54
set 0 362 54
for 0 362 54
Monday. 0 362 54

Even 0 362 55
Senators 0 362 55
Jeff 0 362 55
Flake, 0 362 55
Bob 0 362 55
Corker 0 362 55
and 0 362 55
Lindsey 0 362 55
Graham, 0 362 55
who 0 362 55
have 0 362 55
all 0 362 55
said 0 362 55
Ford 0 362 55
needs 0 362 55
to 0 362 55
be 0 362 55
heard, 0 362 55
have 0 362 55
indicated 0 362 55
that 0 362 55
if 0 362 55
she 0 362 55
does 0 362 55
not 0 362 55
show 0 362 55
up 0 362 55
for 0 362 55
Monday's 0 362 55
hearing, 0 362 55
they 0 362 55
will 0 362 55
schedule 0 362 55
a 0 362 55
vote 0 362 55
on 0 362 55
Kavanaugh's 0 362 55
confirmation. 0 362 55

On 0 362 56
Thursday 0 362 56
afternoon, 0 362 56
Ford's 0 362 56
highly 1 362 56
partisan, 1 362 56
activist 1 362 56
attorney 1 362 56
emailed 0 362 56
Grassley 0 362 56
saying, 0 362 56
although 0 362 56
her 0 362 56
client 0 362 56
strongly 0 362 56
prefers 0 362 56
that 0 362 56
an 0 362 56
investigation 0 362 56
take 0 362 56
place 0 362 56
beforehand, 0 362 56
Ford 0 362 56
will 0 362 56
testify 0 362 56
next 0 362 56
week, 0 362 56
but 0 362 56
she 0 362 56
cannot 0 362 56
do 0 362 56
so 0 362 56
on 0 362 56
Monday. 0 362 56

And 0 362 57
she 0 362 57
will 0 362 57
only 0 362 57
be 0 362 57
questioned 0 362 57
by 0 362 57
members 0 362 57
of 0 362 57
the 0 362 57
Senate 0 362 57
panel, 0 362 57
not 0 362 57
outside 0 362 57
lawyers. 0 362 57

Why 1 362 58
not 1 362 58
Monday? 1 362 58

Does 1 362 59
she 1 362 59
have 1 362 59
an 1 362 59
important 1 362 59
dentist 1 362 59
appointment 1 362 59
she 1 362 59
can't 1 362 59
get 1 362 59
out 1 362 59
of? 1 362 59

In 0 362 60
order 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
avoid 0 362 60
the 0 362 60
criticism 0 362 60
that 0 362 60
will 0 362 60
no 0 362 60
doubt 0 362 60
come 0 362 60
anyway, 0 362 60
the 0 362 60
Republicans 0 362 60
on 0 362 60
the 0 362 60
Senate 0 362 60
Judicial 0 362 60
committee 0 362 60
have 0 362 60
tried 0 362 60
very 0 362 60
hard 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
oblige 0 362 60
Ford's 0 362 60
requests, 0 362 60
even 0 362 60
offering 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
go 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
California 0 362 60
to 0 362 60
hear 0 362 60
her 0 362 60
testimony. 0 362 60

She 0 362 61
and 0 362 61
her 0 362 61
attorneys 0 362 61
feel 0 362 61
that 0 362 61
they 0 362 61
are 0 362 61
in 0 362 61
the 0 362 61
driver's 0 362 61
seat 0 362 61
and 0 362 61
thus, 0 362 61
can 0 362 61
call 0 362 61
all 0 362 61
the 0 362 61
shots. 0 362 61

Democrats 1 362 62
want 1 362 62
to 1 362 62
delay 1 362 62
this 1 362 62
vote 1 362 62
until 1 362 62
after 1 362 62
the 1 362 62
midterms 1 362 62
because 1 362 62
they 1 362 62
believe 1 362 62
they 1 362 62
have 1 362 62
a 1 362 62
chance 1 362 62
to 1 362 62
retake 1 362 62
the 1 362 62
Senate 1 362 62
as 1 362 62
well 1 362 62
as 1 362 62
the 1 362 62
House. 1 362 62

Rush 0 362 63
Limbaugh 0 362 63
points 0 362 63
out 0 362 63
that 0 362 63
the 0 362 63
Senate 0 362 63
has 0 362 63
bent 1 362 63
over 1 362 63
backwards 1 362 63
to 0 362 63
accommodate 0 362 63
the 0 362 63
accuser. 0 362 63

"I 0 362 64
don’t 1 362 64
care 1 362 64
who 1 362 64
you 1 362 64
are, 1 362 64
determine 0 362 64
the 0 362 64
scope 0 362 64
and 0 362 64
the 0 362 64
parameters 0 362 64
of 0 362 64
an 0 362 64
investigation. 0 362 64

The 0 362 65
accuser 0 362 65
doesn’t 0 362 65
get 0 362 65
to 0 362 65
determine 0 362 65
when 0 362 65
and 0 362 65
who 0 362 65
investigates. 0 362 65

In 1 362 66
no 1 362 66
circumstance 1 362 66
in 1 362 66
the 1 362 66
country 1 362 66
does 1 362 66
that 1 362 66
happen." 1 362 66

In 0 362 67
addition 0 362 67
to 0 362 67
the 0 362 67
political 0 362 67
reasons 0 362 67
for 0 362 67
the 0 362 67
delay 0 362 67
requests, 0 362 67
it 0 362 67
appears 0 362 67
as 0 362 67
if 0 362 67
this 0 362 67
woman 0 362 67
is 0 362 67
reluctant 0 362 67
to 0 362 67
testify 0 362 67
under 0 362 67
oath, 0 362 67
possibly 0 362 67
because 0 362 67
she 0 362 67
doesn’t 0 362 67
want 0 362 67
to 0 362 67
perjure 0 362 67
herself. 0 362 67

Maybe 0 362 68
she 0 362 68
realizes 0 362 68
the 0 362 68
magnitude 0 362 68
of 0 362 68
what 0 362 68
her 0 362 68
accusations 0 362 68
have 0 362 68
unleashed. 0 362 68

Either 0 362 69
this 0 362 69
did 0 362 69
not 0 362 69
happen 0 362 69
at 0 362 69
all 0 362 69
or 0 362 69
a 0 362 69
much 0 362 69
milder 0 362 69
version 0 362 69
of 0 362 69
the 0 362 69
situation 0 362 69
she 0 362 69
alleges 0 362 69
occurred. 0 362 69

Kavanaugh 0 362 70
may 0 362 70
have 0 362 70
made 0 362 70
a 0 362 70
pass 0 362 70
at 0 362 70
her 0 362 70
as 0 362 70
17-year-old 0 362 70
boys 0 362 70
(and 0 362 70
even 0 362 70
some 0 362 70
17-year-old 0 362 70
girls) 0 362 70
are 0 362 70
known 0 362 70
to 0 362 70
do. 0 362 70

Ford 0 362 71
said 0 362 71
no 0 362 71
and 0 362 71
that 0 362 71
was 0 362 71
it. 0 362 71

Even 0 362 72
she 0 362 72
admits, 0 362 72
they 0 362 72
did 0 362 72
not 0 362 72
have 0 362 72
sex, 0 362 72
nor 0 362 72
was 0 362 72
this 0 362 72
a 0 362 72
hostage 0 362 72
situation. 0 362 72

The 0 362 73
perception 0 362 73
of 0 362 73
events 0 362 73
by 0 362 73
a 0 362 73
15-year-old 0 362 73
girl 0 362 73
may 0 362 73
differ 0 362 73
significantly 0 362 73
from 0 362 73
reality. 0 362 73

And 0 362 74
36 0 362 74
years 0 362 74
can 0 362 74
distort 0 362 74
memories, 0 362 74
one 0 362 74
way 0 362 74
or 0 362 74
another. 0 362 74

What 1 362 75
is 1 362 75
happening 1 362 75
in 1 362 75
the 1 362 75
Brett 1 362 75
Kavanaugh 1 362 75
nomination 1 362 75
process 1 362 75
should 1 362 75
concern 1 362 75
every 1 362 75
American. 1 362 75

Whatever 0 362 76
happened 0 362 76
or 0 362 76
did 0 362 76
not 0 362 76
happen, 0 362 76
it's 0 362 76
difficult 0 362 76
to 0 362 76
feel 0 362 76
sorry 0 362 76
for 0 362 76
someone 0 362 76
who 0 362 76
comes 0 362 76
forward 0 362 76
at 0 362 76
such 0 362 76
a 0 362 76
politically 0 362 76
opportune 0 362 76
moment. 0 362 76

There 0 362 77
was 0 362 77
ample 0 362 77
time 0 362 77
to 0 362 77
have 0 362 77
addressed 0 362 77
this 0 362 77
in 0 362 77
July 0 362 77
or 0 362 77
August, 0 362 77
but 0 362 77
Dianne 0 362 77
Feinstein 0 362 77
chose 1 362 77
to 1 362 77
sit 1 362 77
on 1 362 77
it 1 362 77
until 1 362 77
the 1 362 77
moment 1 362 77
it 1 362 77
could 1 362 77
inflict 1 362 77
maximum 1 362 77
political 1 362 77
damage. 1 362 77

Democrats 0 362 78
may 0 362 78
be 0 362 78
overestimating 0 362 78
the 0 362 78
strength 0 362 78
of 0 362 78
their 0 362 78
hand. 0 362 78

And 0 362 79
Ms. 0 362 79
Ford 0 362 79
may 0 362 79
be 0 362 79
overestimating 1 362 79
the 1 362 79
integrity 1 362 79
of 1 362 79
the 1 362 79
"supportive" 1 362 79
lawmakers 1 362 79
and 1 362 79
lawyers 1 362 79
currently 1 362 79
handling 1 362 79
her. 1 362 79

Watch 0 362 80
all 0 362 80
these 0 362 80
sensitive 1 362 80
lawmakers 1 362 80
and 1 362 80
high 1 362 80
profile, 1 362 80
activist 1 362 80
attorneys 1 362 80
scatter 1 362 80
like 1 362 80
mice 1 362 80
from 0 362 80
her 0 362 80
once 0 362 80
the 0 362 80
Senate 0 362 80

The 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
recounted 0 365 5
a 0 365 5
claim 0 365 5
by 0 365 5
Deborah 0 365 5
Ramirez, 0 365 5
a 0 365 5
Yale 0 365 5

concerning 0 365 5
“a 0 365 5
dormitory 0 365 5
party 0 365 5
gone 0 365 5
awry.” 0 365 5
As 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
acknowledged, 0 365 5
however, 0 365 5
“her 0 365 5
memories 0 365 5
contained 0 365 5
gaps 0 365 5
because 0 365 5
she 0 365 5
had 0 365 5
been 0 365 5
drinking 0 365 5
at 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
time 0 365 5
of 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
alleged 0 365 5
incident.” 0 365 5
The 0 365 5
article 0 365 5
goes 0 365 5
on 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
say 0 365 5
that 0 365 5
in 0 365 5
her 0 365 5
initial 0 365 5
conversations 0 365 5
with 0 365 5
The 0 365 5
New 0 365 5
Yorker, 0 365 5
Ms. 0 365 5
Ramirez 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
“reluctant 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
characterize 0 365 5
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 5

the 0 365 5
alleged 0 365 5

with 0 365 5
certainty.” 0 365 5
It 0 365 5
was 0 365 5
only 0 365 5
after 0 365 5
“six 0 365 5

that 0 365 5
Ms. 0 365 5

was 0 365 5
suddenly 0 365 5
able 0 365 5
to 0 365 5
pinpoint 0 365 5
Judge 0 365 5
Kavanaugh 0 365 5
as 0 365 5
having 0 365 5
committed 0 365 5
an 0 365 5
unsavory 0 365 5
act, 0 365 5
even 0 365 5
though 0 365 5
she 0 365 5
admitted 0 365 5
being 0 365 5
“foggy” 0 365 5
at 0 365 5
the 0 365 5
time. 0 365 5

The 0 365 6
New 0 365 6

article 0 365 6
also 0 365 6
noted 0 365 6
that 0 365 6
the 0 365 6

Haters 1 365 8
of 1 365 8
Judge 1 365 8

are 0 365 8
turning 0 365 8

something 0 365 8
worse 1 365 8

He 0 365 17

how 0 365 18

to 0 365 21
postpone 0 365 21
Thursday’s 0 365 21
scheduled 0 365 21
hearing. 0 365 21

Ideally, 0 365 22
if 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
Democrats 0 365 22
cannot 0 365 22
apply 0 365 22
enough 0 365 22
pressure 0 365 22
to 0 365 22
force 0 365 22
a 0 365 22
withdrawal 0 365 22
of 0 365 22
Judge 0 365 22
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 22
nomination 0 365 22
through 0 365 22
their 0 365 22
relentless 0 365 22
campaign 0 365 22
of 0 365 22
character 1 365 22
assassination, 1 365 22
they 0 365 22
want 0 365 22
to 0 365 22
push 0 365 22
any 0 365 22
Senate 0 365 22
votes 0 365 22
until 0 365 22
after 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
midterm 0 365 22
elections 0 365 22
at 0 365 22
the 0 365 22
earliest. 0 365 22

Then 0 365 23
they 0 365 23
will 0 365 23
claim 0 365 23
that 0 365 23
the 0 365 23
newly 0 365 23
elected 0 365 23
senators 0 365 23
should 0 365 23
be 0 365 23
involved 0 365 23
in 0 365 23
the 0 365 23
confirmation 0 365 23
decision. 0 365 23

In 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
meantime, 0 365 24
Judge 0 365 24
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 24
adversaries 0 365 24
in 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
Senate, 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
mainstream 0 365 24
media 0 365 24
and 0 365 24
progressive 0 365 24
circles 0 365 24
continue 1 365 24
to 1 365 24
bludgeon 1 365 24
Judge 0 365 24
Kavanaugh 0 365 24
in 0 365 24
the 0 365 24
court 0 365 24
of 0 365 24
public 0 365 24
opinion. 0 365 24

All 0 365 25
of 0 365 25
their 0 365 25
stratagems 0 365 25
are 0 365 25
an 0 365 25
obvious 0 365 25
attempt 0 365 25
to 0 365 25
buy 0 365 25
time 0 365 25
in 0 365 25

to 0 365 25
persuade 0 365 25
any 0 365 25
wavering 0 365 25
senators 0 365 25
that 0 365 25
Judge 0 365 25
Kavanaugh 0 365 25
is 0 365 25
too 0 365 25
tainted 0 365 25
by 0 365 25

on 0 365 25
the 0 365 25
Supreme 0 365 25
Court. 0 365 25

Proof 0 365 26
does 0 365 26
not 0 365 26
matter 0 365 26
to 0 365 26
those 0 365 26
wanting 0 365 26
to 0 365 26

Ms. 0 365 27
Ford’s 0 365 27

Senator 0 365 28

The 0 365 29
FBI 0 365 29

checks, 0 365 29
no 0 365 29
federal 0 365 29

no 0 365 29
forensic 0 365 29
evidence 0 365 29

30 0 365 29
years 0 365 29
at 0 365 29
a 0 365 29
site 0 365 29
that 0 365 29
Ms. 0 365 29
Ford 0 365 29
cannot 0 365 29
even 0 365 29
identify. 0 365 29

What 1 365 30
we 1 365 30
do 1 365 30
know 1 365 30
so 1 365 30
far 1 365 30
tends 1 365 30
to 1 365 30
undercut 1 365 30
the 1 365 30
credibility 1 365 30
of 1 365 30
Ms. 1 365 30
Ford’s 1 365 30
accusation. 1 365 30

Ms. 0 365 31
Ford 0 365 31
cannot 0 365 31
corroborate 0 365 31
her 0 365 31
decades-old 0 365 31
charge 0 365 31
of 0 365 31
sexual 0 365 31
assault 0 365 31
against 0 365 31
Judge 0 365 31
Kavanaugh. 0 365 31

Whatever 1 365 32
corroboration 1 365 32
Ms. 1 365 32
Ford 1 365 32
was 1 365 32
hoping 1 365 32
for 1 365 32
from 1 365 32
“witnesses” 1 365 32
she 1 365 32
claimed 1 365 32
were 1 365 32
at 1 365 32
the 1 365 32
alleged 1 365 32
party 1 365 32
is 1 365 32
non-existent. 1 365 32

The 0 365 33
individuals 0 365 33
she 0 365 33
reportedly 0 365 33
named 0 365 33
in 0 365 33
her 0 365 33
unredacted 0 365 33
confidential 0 365 33
letter 0 365 33
given 0 365 33
to 0 365 33
Senator 0 365 33
Feinstein 0 365 33
have 0 365 33
either 0 365 33
denied 0 365 33
being 0 365 33
at 0 365 33
such 0 365 33
a 0 365 33
party 0 365 33
or 0 365 33
do 0 365 33
not 0 365 33
recollect 0 365 33
what 0 365 33
Ms. 0 365 33
Ford 0 365 33
has 0 365 33
alleged. 0 365 33

Moreover, 0 365 34
by 0 365 34
her 0 365 34
own 0 365 34
admission 0 365 34
to 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
Washington 0 365 34
Post, 0 365 34
Ms. 0 365 34
Ford 0 365 34
“said 0 365 34
she 0 365 34
does 0 365 34
not 0 365 34
remember 0 365 34
some 0 365 34
key 0 365 34
details 0 365 34
of 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
incident.” 0 365 34
She 0 365 34
does 0 365 34
not 0 365 34
remember, 0 365 34
for 0 365 34
example, 0 365 34
where 0 365 34
it 0 365 34
happened, 0 365 34
how 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
party 0 365 34
came 0 365 34
together 0 365 34
in 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
first 0 365 34
place, 0 365 34
or 0 365 34
how 0 365 34
she 0 365 34
got 0 365 34
home 0 365 34
after 0 365 34
the 0 365 34
alleged 0 365 34
incident. 0 365 34

She 0 365 35
believes 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
alleged 0 365 35
incident 0 365 35
occurred 0 365 35
during 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
summer 0 365 35
of 0 365 35
1982, 0 365 35
but 0 365 35
reportedly 0 365 35
could 0 365 35
not 0 365 35
be 0 365 35
more 0 365 35
precise 0 365 35
on 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
day 0 365 35
or 0 365 35
even 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
month 0 365 35
of 0 365 35
the 0 365 35
party. 0 365 35

Afraid 0 365 36
that 0 365 36
Ms. 0 365 36
Ford’s 0 365 36
sexual 0 365 36
assault 0 365 36
allegation 0 365 36
could 0 365 36
be 0 365 36
readily 0 365 36
challenged 0 365 36
and 0 365 36
anxious 0 365 36
to 0 365 36
establish 0 365 36
some 0 365 36
sort 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
pattern 0 365 36
of 0 365 36
sexual 0 365 36
misconduct 0 365 36
beyond 0 365 36
this 0 365 36
single 0 365 36
alleged 0 365 36
incident, 0 365 36
the 1 365 36
Kavanaugh 1 365 36
haters 1 365 36
have 0 365 36
latched 0 365 36
onto 0 365 36
Ms. 0 365 36
Ramirez’s 0 365 36
story. 0 365 36

The 0 365 37
New 0 365 37
York 0 365 37
Times 0 365 37
published 0 365 37
an 0 365 37
op-ed 0 365 37
column 0 365 37
last 0 365 37
week 0 365 37
by 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
psychiatrist, 0 365 37
Richard 0 365 37
A. 0 365 37
Friedman, 0 365 37
who 0 365 37
cited 0 365 37
neurological 0 365 37
science 0 365 37
to 0 365 37
conclude 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
Ms. 0 365 37
Ford’s 0 365 37
claim 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
she 0 365 37
has 0 365 37
“a 0 365 37
vivid 0 365 37
memory 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
an 0 365 37
attack 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
took 0 365 37
place 0 365 37
when 0 365 37
she 0 365 37
was 0 365 37
15” 0 365 37
is 0 365 37
“credible.” 0 365 37
The 0 365 37
reason, 0 365 37
he 0 365 37
wrote, 0 365 37
is 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
“memories 0 365 37
formed 0 365 37
under 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
influence 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
intense 0 365 37
emotion 0 365 37
— 0 365 37
such 0 365 37
as 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
feelings 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
accompany 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
sexual 0 365 37
assault 0 365 37
— 0 365 37
are 0 365 37
indelible 0 365 37
in 0 365 37
the 0 365 37
way 0 365 37
that 0 365 37
memories 0 365 37
of 0 365 37
a 0 365 37
routine 0 365 37
day 0 365 37
are 0 365 37
not.” 0 365 37
The 1 365 37
only 1 365 37
problem 1 365 37
with 1 365 37
Dr. 1 365 37
Friedman’s 1 365 37
thesis 1 365 37
is 1 365 37
that 1 365 37
Ms. 1 365 37
Ford 1 365 37
has 1 365 37
apparently 1 365 37
forgotten 1 365 37
such 1 365 37
key 1 365 37
details 1 365 37
surrounding 1 365 37
the 1 365 37
alleged 1 365 37
sexual 1 365 37
assault 1 365 37
as 1 365 37
when 1 365 37
and 1 365 37
where 1 365 37
it 1 365 37
happened 1 365 37
and 1 365 37
how 1 365 37
she 1 365 37
got 1 365 37
home. 1 365 37

Moreover, 0 365 38
when 0 365 38
Ms. 0 365 38
Ford 0 365 38
finally 0 365 38
told 0 365 38
someone 0 365 38
about 0 365 38
the 0 365 38
incident 0 365 38
in 0 365 38
any 0 365 38

years 0 365 38

in 0 365 38
2012, 0 365 38

a 0 365 38
couples 0 365 38
therapy 0 365 38
session 0 365 38
with 0 365 38

to 0 365 38
the 0 365 38

notes 0 365 38
that 0 365 38
Ms. 0 365 38

Ms. 0 365 40

reflection 0 365 41
to 0 365 41
help 0 365 41
revive 0 365 41
her 0 365 41
memory 0 365 41
of 0 365 41
an 0 365 41
incident 0 365 41
she 0 365 41
claimed 0 365 41
happened 0 365 41
while 0 365 41
she 0 365 41
herself 0 365 41
was 0 365 41
very 0 365 41
drunk. 0 365 41

Senator 0 365 42
Mazie 0 365 42
Hirono 0 365 42
(D-Hawaii), 0 365 42
one 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
fiercest 0 365 42
critics 0 365 42
who 0 365 42
told 0 365 42
men 0 365 42
to 0 365 42
“shut 0 365 42
up” 0 365 42
regarding 0 365 42
Ms. 0 365 42
Ford’s 0 365 42
allegations, 0 365 42
said 0 365 42
she 1 365 42
doubts 1 365 42
Judge 1 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 42
credibility 1 365 42
because 1 365 42
of 1 365 42
“how 1 365 42
he 1 365 42
approaches 1 365 42
his 1 365 42
cases.” 1 365 42
Aside 0 365 42
from 0 365 42
mischaracterizing 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
constitutional 0 365 42
textualist 0 365 42
reasoning 0 365 42
underlying 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
opinions, 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
is 0 365 42
saying 0 365 42
that 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
does 0 365 42
not 0 365 42
believe 0 365 42
Judge 0 365 42
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 42
denial 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
sexual 0 365 42
misconduct 0 365 42
allegations 0 365 42
lodged 0 365 42
against 0 365 42
him 0 365 42
because 0 365 42
of 0 365 42
the 0 365 42
opinions 0 365 42
he 0 365 42
wrote 0 365 42
that 0 365 42
she 0 365 42
does 0 365 42
not 0 365 42
like. 0 365 42

Such 0 365 43
circular 0 365 43
“reasoning” 0 365 43
would 0 365 43
be 0 365 43
amusing 0 365 43
if 0 365 43
it 0 365 43
were 0 365 43
not 0 365 43
so 0 365 43
emblematic 0 365 43
of 0 365 43
what 0 365 43
one 0 365 43
writer 0 365 43
called 0 365 43
“Kavanaugh 1 365 43
Derangement 1 365 43
Syndrome." 1 365 43

Senator 0 365 44
Kirsten 0 365 44
Gillibrand 0 365 44
(D-N.Y.) 0 365 44
is 0 365 44
also 0 365 44
suffering 0 365 44
from 0 365 44
the 0 365 44
same 0 365 44
syndrome. 0 365 44

She 0 365 45
said 0 365 45
Thursday 0 365 45
regarding 0 365 45
Ms. 0 365 45
Ford: 0 365 45
"I 0 365 45
believe 1 365 45
her 1 365 45
because 1 365 45
she 1 365 45
is 1 365 45
telling 1 365 45
the 1 365 45
truth 1 365 45
and 1 365 45
you 1 365 45
know 1 365 45
it 1 365 45
by 1 365 45
her 1 365 45
story." 1 365 45

Ms. 0 365 46
Ford’s 0 365 46
supporters 0 365 46
are 0 365 46
exploiting 0 365 46
the 0 365 46
“Me 1 365 46
Too” 1 365 46
movement 1 365 46
to 0 365 46
declare 0 365 46
Judge 0 365 46
Kavanaugh 0 365 46
guilty 0 365 46
simply 1 365 46
because 1 365 46
Ms. 1 365 46
Ford 1 365 46
is 1 365 46
a 1 365 46
woman 1 365 46
who 1 365 46
has 1 365 46
made 1 365 46
what 1 365 46
they 1 365 46
call, 1 365 46
without 1 365 46
any 1 365 46
corroborating 1 365 46
evidence 1 365 46
to 1 365 46
date, 1 365 46
a 1 365 46
“credible” 1 365 46
charge. 1 365 46

The 0 365 47
same 0 365 47
would 0 365 47
presumably 0 365 47
be 0 365 47
the 0 365 47
case 0 365 47
for 0 365 47
Ms. 0 365 47
Ramirez. 0 365 47

They 0 365 48
argue 0 365 48
that 0 365 48
since 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
Senate 0 365 48
Judiciary 0 365 48
Committee 0 365 48
is 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
criminal 0 365 48
judicial 0 365 48
trial, 0 365 48
but 0 365 48
rather 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
legislative 0 365 48
hearing 0 365 48
for 0 365 48
confirmation 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
a 0 365 48
Supreme 0 365 48
Court 0 365 48
nominee, 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
normal 0 365 48
burden 0 365 48
of 0 365 48
proof 0 365 48
shouldered 0 365 48
by 0 365 48
the 0 365 48
accuser 0 365 48
should 0 365 48
not 0 365 48
apply. 0 365 48

Judge 0 365 49
Kavanaugh 0 365 49
should 0 365 49
have 0 365 49
to 0 365 49
prove 0 365 49
that 0 365 49
he 0 365 49
is 0 365 49
not 0 365 49
guilty, 0 365 49
they 0 365 49
are 0 365 49
in 0 365 49
effect 0 365 49
insisting. 0 365 49

This 0 365 50
is 0 365 50
another 0 365 50
case 0 365 50
of 0 365 50
Kavanaugh 1 365 50
Derangement 1 365 50
Syndrome. 1 365 50

Let’s 0 365 51
assume 0 365 51
for 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
sake 0 365 51
of 0 365 51
argument 0 365 51
that 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
normal 0 365 51
burden 0 365 51
on 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
prosecution 0 365 51
in 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
criminal 0 365 51
case 0 365 51
- 0 365 51
to 0 365 51
prove 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
accused’s 0 365 51
guilt 0 365 51
beyond 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
reasonable 0 365 51
doubt 0 365 51
- 0 365 51
is 0 365 51
not 0 365 51
applicable 0 365 51
regarding 0 365 51
the 0 365 51
charge 0 365 51
against 0 365 51
Judge 0 365 51
Kavanaugh 0 365 51
since 0 365 51
he 0 365 51
is 0 365 51
not 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
defendant 0 365 51
in 0 365 51
a 0 365 51
criminal 0 365 51
trial. 0 365 51

However, 0 365 52
that 0 365 52
should 0 365 52
not 0 365 52
flip 0 365 52
the 0 365 52
burden 0 365 52
of 0 365 52
proof 0 365 52
onto 0 365 52
Judge 0 365 52
Kavanaugh 0 365 52
altogether. 0 365 52

Judge 0 365 53
Kavanaugh 0 365 53
is 0 365 53
being 0 365 53
subjected 0 365 53
to 0 365 53
charges 0 365 53
of 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
criminal 0 365 53
nature 0 365 53
that 0 365 53
could 0 365 53
not 0 365 53
only 0 365 53
deprive 0 365 53
him 0 365 53
of 0 365 53
a 0 365 53
seat 0 365 53
on 0 365 53
the 0 365 53
Supreme 0 365 53
Court 0 365 53
for 0 365 53
which 0 365 53
he 0 365 53
is 0 365 53
otherwise 0 365 53
eminently 0 365 53
qualified. 0 365 53

Ms. 0 365 54
Ford’s 0 365 54
unsubstantiated 0 365 54
accusation 0 365 54
can 0 365 54
completely 1 365 54
destroy 1 365 54
Judge 1 365 54
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 54
life 1 365 54
by 0 365 54
causing 0 365 54
irreparable 0 365 54
damage 0 365 54
to 0 365 54
his 0 365 54
reputation 0 365 54
for 0 365 54
integrity 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
good 0 365 54
character 0 365 54
and 0 365 54
to 0 365 54
his 0 365 54
career, 0 365 54
which 0 365 54
he 0 365 54
has 0 365 54
built 0 365 54
up 0 365 54
during 0 365 54
decades 0 365 54
of 0 365 54
public 0 365 54
service. 0 365 54

His 0 365 55
family’s 0 365 55
lives 0 365 55
have 0 365 55
been 0 365 55
completely 0 365 55
upended. 0 365 55

Placing 0 365 56
the 0 365 56
burden 0 365 56
on 0 365 56
Judge 0 365 56
Kavanaugh 0 365 56
to 0 365 56
prove 0 365 56
that 0 365 56
he 0 365 56
was 0 365 56
not 0 365 56
involved 0 365 56
in 0 365 56
an 0 365 56
uncorroborated 0 365 56
incident 0 365 56
from 0 365 56
years 0 365 56
ago, 0 365 56
about 0 365 56
which 0 365 56
even 0 365 56
his 0 365 56
accuser 0 365 56
does 0 365 56
not 0 365 56
recall 0 365 56
key 0 365 56
details, 0 365 56
turns 1 365 56
the 1 365 56
fundamental 1 365 56
constitutional 1 365 56
principle 1 365 56
of 1 365 56
due 1 365 56
process 1 365 56
upside 1 365 56
down. 1 365 56

Ms. 0 365 57
Ford 0 365 57
should 0 365 57
have 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
burden 0 365 57
to 0 365 57
prove 0 365 57
her 0 365 57
accusations 0 365 57
by 0 365 57
at 0 365 57
least 0 365 57
a 0 365 57
preponderance 0 365 57
of 0 365 57
all 0 365 57
the 0 365 57
evidence 0 365 57
presented. 0 365 57

This 1 365 58
charade 1 365 58
must 0 365 58
come 0 365 58
to 0 365 58
an 0 365 58
end. 0 365 58

No 0 365 59
more 0 365 59
extensions 0 365 59
for 0 365 59
Ms. 0 365 59
Ford 0 365 59
to 0 365 59
come 0 365 59
forward 0 365 59
and 0 365 59
testify. 0 365 59

If 0 365 60
Ms. 0 365 60
Ford 0 365 60
does 0 365 60
not 0 365 60
follow 0 365 60
through 0 365 60
with 0 365 60
her 0 365 60
agreement 0 365 60
to 0 365 60
testify 0 365 60
in 0 365 60
an 0 365 60
open 0 365 60
Senate 0 365 60
Judiciary 0 365 60
Committee 0 365 60
hearing 0 365 60
this 0 365 60
Thursday 0 365 60
and 0 365 60
do 0 365 60
so 0 365 60
upon 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
conditions 0 365 60
set 0 365 60
by 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
committee, 0 365 60
she 0 365 60
should 0 365 60
go 0 365 60
home 0 365 60
while 0 365 60
the 0 365 60
committee 0 365 60
proceeds 0 365 60
to 0 365 60
an 0 365 60
immediate 0 365 60
vote 0 365 60
on 0 365 60
Judge 0 365 60
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 60
nomination. 0 365 60

If 0 365 61
Ms. 0 365 61
Ford 0 365 61
and 0 365 61
Judge 0 365 61
Kavanaugh 0 365 61
do 0 365 61
testify, 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
senators 0 365 61
deciding 0 365 61
on 0 365 61
whether 0 365 61
to 0 365 61
confirm 0 365 61
Judge 0 365 61
Kavanaugh 0 365 61
as 0 365 61
well 0 365 61
as 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
American 0 365 61
public 0 365 61
following 0 365 61
the 0 365 61
testimony 0 365 61
must 0 365 61
remember 0 365 61
one 0 365 61
cardinal 0 365 61
rule. 0 365 61

In 1 365 62
a 1 365 62
nation 1 365 62
guided 1 365 62
by 1 365 62
fairness 1 365 62
and 1 365 62
law, 1 365 62
a 1 365 62
person 1 365 62
is 1 365 62
innocent 1 365 62
until 1 365 62
proven 1 365 62
guilty. 1 365 62

Sadly, 0 365 63
many 0 365 63
of 0 365 63
Judge 1 365 63
Kavanaugh’s 1 365 63
haters 1 365 63
have 0 365 63
thrown 0 365 63
that 0 365 63
rule 0 365 63
aside. 0 365 63

If 0 365 64
Judge 0 365 64
Kavanaugh’s 0 365 64
nomination 0 365 64
is 0 365 64
pulled 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
a 0 365 64
result 0 365 64
of 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
smears 1 365 64
and 0 365 64
character 1 365 64
assassination, 1 365 64
President 0 365 64
Trump 0 365 64
should 0 365 64
immediately 0 365 64
nominate 0 365 64
someone 0 365 64
on 0 365 64
his 0 365 64
short 0 365 64
list 0 365 64
such 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
Amy 0 365 64
Coney 0 365 64
Barrett 0 365 64
and 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
Senate 0 365 64
Republican 0 365 64
majority 0 365 64
should 0 365 64
then 0 365 64
push 0 365 64
through 0 365 64
the 0 365 64
new 0 365 64
nominee’s 0 365 64
confirmation 0 365 64
as 0 365 64
soon 0 365 64
as 0 365 64

police 0 368 23
to 0 368 23
ensure 0 368 23
that 0 368 23
he 0 368 23

Loomer 0 368 24
peppered 0 368 24
him 0 368 24
with 0 368 24
questions 0 368 24
about 0 368 24

Ellison 0 368 26
not 0 368 26
only 0 368 26
claimed 0 368 26
the 0 368 26
women 0 368 26
were 0 368 26
lying 0 368 26
but 0 368 26
then 0 368 26
fled 0 368 26
the 0 368 26
scene. 0 368 26

At 0 368 27
least 0 368 27
he 0 368 27
said 0 368 27
something 0 368 27
there, 0 368 27
which 0 368 27
is 0 368 27
more 0 368 27
than 0 368 27
I 0 368 27
can 0 368 27
say 0 368 27
for 0 368 27
his 0 368 27
response 0 368 27
earlier 0 368 27
in 0 368 27
September 0 368 27
when 0 368 27
Loomer 0 368 27
confronted 0 368 27
him 0 368 27
at 0 368 27
another 0 368 27
event 0 368 27
with 0 368 27
questions. 0 368 27

Failing 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
answer, 0 368 28
Ellison 0 368 28
tried 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
move 0 368 28
from 0 368 28
person 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
person, 0 368 28
allowing 0 368 28
his 0 368 28
minions 1 368 28
to 0 368 28
try 0 368 28
and 0 368 28
provide 0 368 28
cover 0 368 28
for 0 368 28
him, 0 368 28
similar 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
that 0 368 28
of 0 368 28
Maxine 0 368 28
Waters, 0 368 28
but 0 368 28
there 0 368 28
was 0 368 28
no 0 368 28
"member's 0 368 28
only" 0 368 28
elevator 0 368 28
to 0 368 28
flee 0 368 28
into. 0 368 28

Finally, 0 368 29
Ellison 0 368 29
fled 0 368 29
the 0 368 29
scene, 0 368 29
hounding 0 368 29
by 0 368 29
Loomer 0 368 29

baldly 0 368 34
dissembled 0 368 34
about 0 368 34
this 0 368 34
history 0 368 34
since 0 368 34
2006. 0 368 34

Ellison 0 368 35
simply 0 368 35
omitted 0 368 35
it 0 368 35
and 0 368 35
presented 0 368 35
himself 0 368 35
as 0 368 35

This 0 368 36
past 0 368 36
June, 0 368 36
Ellison 0 368 36
told 0 368 36
Jake 0 368 36
Tapper 0 368 36
on 0 368 36
CNN, 0 368 36
“I 0 368 36

Police 0 368 44
later 0 368 44
determined 0 368 44
that 0 368 44

the 0 368 45

Despite 0 368 46
the 0 368 46
fact 0 368 46
that 0 368 46
two 0 368 46

At 0 368 47
the 0 368 47

In 0 368 49

In 0 368 70
2013, 0 368 70
the 0 368 70
FBI 0 368 70
made 0 368 70

The 0 368 71
FBI 0 368 71
has 0 368 71
offered 0 368 71
a 0 368 71

of 0 368 71
up 0 368 71
to 0 368 71
$1,000,000 0 368 71
for 0 368 71
her 0 368 71
capture. 0 368 71

Yet 0 368 72
Ellison 0 368 72
prayed 0 368 72
for 0 368 72
Chesimard 0 368 72
in 0 368 72
his 0 368 72
National 0 368 72
Lawyers 0 368 72
Guild 0 368 72
speech: 0 368 72
“I 0 368 72

people,” 0 368 72
he 0 368 72
told 0 368 72
the 0 368 72
crowd. 0 368 72

“I 0 368 73
hope 0 368 73

on 0 368 73
it.” 0 368 73
Ellison’s 0 368 73
support 0 368 73
for 0 368 73
Soliah/Olson 0 368 73
in 0 368 73
the 0 368 73
speech 0 368 73
is 0 368 73
equally 0 368 73
notable. 0 368 73

He 0 368 74
denounced 0 368 74
law 0 368 74
enforcement 0 368 74
authorities 0 368 74
for 0 368 74
prosecuting 0 368 74

attempted 0 368 74
murder 0 368 74
of 0 368 74

officers. 0 368 74

Referring 0 368 75
to 0 368 75
the 0 368 75
days 0 368 75
Soliah/Olson 0 368 75
had 0 368 75
spent 0 368 75
in 0 368 75
the 0 368 75
SLA 0 368 75
under 0 368 75
the 0 368 75
leadership 0 368 75
of 0 368 75
Donald 0 368 75
DeFreeze 0 368 75
(“Field 0 368 75
Marshal 0 368 75
Cinque”), 0 368 75
Ellison 0 368 75
hailed 0 368 75
Soliah/Olson 0 368 75
as 0 368 75
a 0 368 75
“black 1 368 75
gang 1 368 75
member” 1 368 75
and 0 368 75
portrayed 0 368 75
her 0 368 75
as 0 368 75
a 0 368 75
victim 0 368 75
of 0 368 75
government 0 368 75
persecution. 0 368 75

He 0 368 76
described 0 368 76
her 0 368 76
as 0 368 76
one 0 368 76
of 0 368 76
those 0 368 76
who 0 368 76
had 0 368 76
been 0 368 76
“fighting 0 368 76
for 0 368 76
freedom 0 368 76
in 0 368 76
the 0 368 76
‘60s 0 368 76
and’70s” 0 368 76
and 0 368 76
called 0 368 76
for 0 368 76
her 0 368 76
release. 0 368 76

Ellison 0 368 77
to 0 368 77
the 0 368 77
contrary 0 368 77
notwithstanding, 0 368 77
Soliah/Olson 0 368 77
pleaded 0 368 77
guilty 0 368 77
to 0 368 77
the 0 368 77
crimes 0 368 77
charged 0 368 77
in 0 368 77
Los 0 368 77
Angeles 0 368 77
and 0 368 77
to 0 368 77
an 0 368 77
additional 0 368 77
murder 0 368 77
charge 0 368 77
in 0 368 77
Sacramento. 0 368 77

According 0 368 78
to 0 368 78
Ellison, 0 368 78
Soliah/Olson 0 368 78
was 0 368 78
a 0 368 78
social 0 368 78
justice 0 368 78
warrior 0 368 78
fighting 0 368 78
the 0 368 78
good 0 368 78
fight. 0 368 78

The 0 368 79
case 0 368 79
had 0 368 79
nothing 0 368 79
to 0 368 79
do 0 368 79
with 0 368 79
the 0 368 79
attempted 0 368 79
murder 0 368 79
of 0 368 79
police 0 368 79
officers; 0 368 79
that 0 368 79
was 0 368 79
but 0 368 79
a 0 368 79
pretext. 0 368 79

Seems 0 368 80
he 0 368 80
is 0 368 80
more 0 368 80
than 0 368 80
willing 0 368 80
to 0 368 80
use 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
police 0 368 80
to 0 368 80

him 0 368 80
from 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
press 0 368 80
who 0 368 80
will 0 368 80
confront 0 368 80
him 0 368 80
publicly 0 368 80
while 0 368 80
taking 0 368 80
the 0 368 80
side 0 368 80
of 0 368 80
their 0 368 80

Friday, 0 370 21
Hall 0 370 21
refused 0 370 21
to 0 370 21
fire 0 370 21

“There 0 370 21
is 0 370 21
one 0 370 21

to 0 370 23
refuse 0 370 23
to 0 370 23
fire 0 370 23
Guyger, 0 370 23
claiming 0 370 23
it 0 370 23
would 0 370 23
be 0 370 23
against 0 370 23
the 0 370 23

“I 0 370 24

to 0 370 25
adhere 0 370 25
to,” 0 370 25
said 0 370 25
Hall. 0 370 25

Apparently, 0 370 26
it 0 370 26
is 0 370 26
no 0 370 26
longer 0 370 26
against 0 370 26
the 0 370 26
law. 0 370 26

This 0 370 27
news 0 370 27
will 0 370 27
likely 0 370 27
be 0 370 27
well 0 370 27
received 0 370 27
by 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
Jean 0 370 27
family 0 370 27
as 0 370 27
well 0 370 27
as 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
activists 0 370 27
who 0 370 27
have 0 370 27
been 0 370 27
calling 0 370 27
for 0 370 27
justice 0 370 27
for 0 370 27
Botham 0 370 27
since 0 370 27
the 0 370 27
beginning. 0 370 27

As 0 370 28
TFTP 0 370 28
previously 0 370 28
reported, 0 370 28
the 0 370 28
idea 0 370 28
of 0 370 28
not 0 370 28
firing 0 370 28
Guyger 0 370 28
seemed 0 370 28
utterly 1 370 28
preposterous 1 370 28
as 0 370 28
she 0 370 28
admitted 0 370 28
to 0 370 28
doing 0 370 28
something 0 370 28
wrong. 0 370 28

While 0 370 29
controversy 0 370 29
swarms 0 370 29
the 0 370 29
case 0 370 29
of 0 370 29
why 0 370 29
she 0 370 29
may 0 370 29
have 0 370 29
killed 0 370 29
Jean, 0 370 29
there 0 370 29
is 0 370 29
no 0 370 29
doubt 0 370 29
that 0 370 29
she 0 370 29
did 0 370 29
kill 0 370 29
him. 0 370 29

This 0 370 30
is 0 370 30
a 0 370 30
fact. 0 370 30

This 0 370 31
public 0 370 31
servant 0 370 31
walked 0 370 31
into 0 370 31
an 0 370 31
innocent 1 370 31
man’s 0 370 31
home 0 370 31
and 0 370 31
shot 0 370 31
him 0 370 31
dead. 0 370 31

Because 0 370 32
of 0 370 32
her 0 370 32
actions, 0 370 32
this 0 370 32
man 0 370 32
no 0 370 32
longer 0 370 32
lives. 0 370 32

This 0 370 33
alone 0 370 33
should 0 370 33
have 0 370 33
been 0 370 33
enough 0 370 33
to 0 370 33
fire 0 370 33
her. 0 370 33

Surprisingly 0 370 34
enough, 0 370 34
NRA 0 370 34
spokesperson 0 370 34
Dana 0 370 34
Loesch 0 370 34
responded 0 370 34
to 0 370 34
the 0 370 34
firing 0 370 34
of 0 370 34
Guyger 0 370 34
with 0 370 34
one 0 370 34
word, 0 370 34
“Good,” 0 370 34
showing 0 370 34
her 0 370 34
support 0 370 34
for 0 370 34
the 0 370 34
move. 0 370 34

For 0 370 35
those 0 370 35
who 0 370 35
don’t 0 370 35
recall, 0 370 35
Loesch 0 370 35
sparked 0 370 35
controversy 0 370 35
earlier 0 370 35
this 0 370 35
month 0 370 35
by 0 370 35
claiming 0 370 35
that 0 370 35
if 0 370 35
Botham 0 370 35
Jean 0 370 35
were 0 370 35
a 0 370 35
gun 0 370 35
owner, 0 370 35
he 0 370 35
may 0 370 35
be 0 370 35
alive 0 370 35
today. 0 370 35

Indeed, 0 370 36
as 0 370 36
TFTP 0 370 36
reported 0 370 36
over 0 370 36
the 0 370 36
weekend, 0 370 36
a 0 370 36
father 0 370 36
in 0 370 36
Prince 0 370 36
George’s 0 370 36
County 0 370 36
opened 0 370 36
fire 0 370 36
on 0 370 36
officers 0 370 36
as 0 370 36
they 0 370 36
wrongly 0 370 36
entered 0 370 36
his 0 370 36
apartment. 0 370 36

He 0 370 37
shot 0 370 37
two 0 370 37
officers. 0 370 37

Not 0 370 38
only 0 370 38
was 0 370 38
he 0 370 38
not 0 370 38
arrested, 0 370 38
but 0 370 38
the 0 370 38
police 0 370 38
chief 0 370 38
praised 0 370 38
him 0 370 38
and 0 370 38
apologized. 0 370 38

In 0 370 39
response 0 370 39
to 0 370 39
Guyger’s 0 370 39
termination, 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
family’s 0 370 39
attorney, 0 370 39
Lee 0 370 39
Merritt 0 370 39
noted 0 370 39
that 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
family 0 370 39
expressed 0 370 39
“satisfaction” 0 370 39
with 0 370 39
the 0 370 39
move. 0 370 39

“The 0 370 40

a 0 82 8
55-year-old 0 82 8
certified 0 82 8
systems 0 82 8
engineer, 0 82 8
who 0 82 8
on 0 82 8
Wednesday 0 82 8
claimed 0 82 8
that 0 82 8
in 0 82 8
the 0 82 8
early 0 82 8
1980s 0 82 8
Kavanaugh 0 82 8

at 0 82 8

clear 0 82 8
the 0 82 8
way 0 82 8
for 0 82 8
them 0 82 8
to 0 82 8
be 0 82 8
gang-raped. 0 82 8

Incredibly, 0 82 9
Swetnick 0 82 9
said 0 82 9
in 0 82 9
a 0 82 9
sworn 0 82 9
statement 0 82 9
that 0 82 9

at 0 82 9
these 0 82 9
parties 0 82 9
but 0 82 9
kept 0 82 9
on 0 82 9
attending 0 82 9
them 0 82 9
anyway. 0 82 9

It 0 82 10
gets 0 82 10
weirder. 0 82 10

Kavanaugh 0 82 11
was 0 82 11
a 1 82 11
“mean 1 82 11
drunk,” 1 82 11
she 0 82 11
stated. 0 82 11

He 0 82 12
drank 0 82 12
excessively 0 82 12
at 0 82 12
these 0 82 12
parties 0 82 12
and 0 82 12
would 0 82 12
grind 0 82 12
against 0 82 12

try 0 82 12

said. 0 82 12

Swetnick 0 82 13

of 0 82 13
these 0 82 13

in 0 82 13
1982 0 82 13
as 0 82 13
a 0 82 13
result 0 82 13
of 0 82 13
consuming 0 82 13
a 0 82 13

that 0 82 13
contained 0 82 13
“Quaaludes 0 82 13

something 0 82 13
similar.” 0 82 13
Kavanaugh 0 82 13
and 0 82 13
his 0 82 13
friend 0 82 13
Mark 0 82 13
Judge 0 82 13
were 0 82 13
present 0 82 13
at 0 82 13
the 0 82 13
party 0 82 13
at 0 82 13
which 0 82 13
she 0 82 13
was 0 82 13
raped, 0 82 13
she 0 82 13
states, 0 82 13
but 0 82 13
she 0 82 13
doesn’t 0 82 13
accuse 0 82 13
them 0 82 13
of 0 82 13
participating 0 82 13
in 0 82 13
it. 0 82 13

In 0 82 14
response, 0 82 14
Kavanaugh 0 82 14
labeled 0 82 14
Swetnick's 0 82 14
salacious 0 82 14
allegations 0 82 14
"ridiculous 1 82 14
and 1 82 14
from 1 82 14

"I 0 82 15

expected, 0 82 53
at 0 82 53
today’s 0 82 53

some 0 82 57
time. 0 82 57

But 0 82 58
I 0 82 58
have 0 82 58
never 0 82 58
done 0 82 58
that 0 82 58
to 0 82 58
her 0 82 58
or 0 82 58
to 0 82 58
anyone. 0 82 58

Kavanaugh 0 82 59
added: 0 82 59
"I 0 82 59
am 0 82 59
innocent 0 82 59
of 0 82 59
this 0 82 59
charge." 0 82 59

Not 0 82 60
surprisingly 0 82 60
Ford’s 0 82 60
prepared 0 82 60
testimony 0 82 60
also 0 82 60
found 0 82 60
its 0 82 60
way 0 82 60
to 0 82 60
reporters. 0 82 60

“I 0 82 61
am 0 82 61
here 0 82 61
today 0 82 61
not 0 82 61
because 0 82 61
I 0 82 61
want 0 82 61
to 0 82 61
be,” 0 82 61
Ford 0 82 61
says 0 82 61
in 0 82 61
her 0 82 61
opening 0 82 61
statement. 0 82 61

“I 0 82 62
am 1 82 62
terrified. 1 82 62

I 0 82 63
am 0 82 63
here 0 82 63
because 0 82 63
I 0 82 63
believe 0 82 63
it 0 82 63
is 0 82 63
my 0 82 63
civic 0 82 63
duty 0 82 63
to 0 82 63
tell 0 82 63
you 0 82 63
what 0 82 63
happened 0 82 63
to 0 82 63
me 0 82 63
while 0 82 63
Brett 0 82 63
Kavanaugh 0 82 63
and 0 82 63
I 0 82 63
were 0 82 63
in 0 82 63
high 0 82 63
school.” 0 82 63

She 0 82 64
describes 0 82 64
the 0 82 64
nominee 0 82 64
as 0 82 64
“Brett 1 82 64
Kavanaugh, 1 82 64
the 1 82 64
boy 1 82 64
who 1 82 64
sexually 1 82 64
assaulted 1 82 64
me,” 1 82 64
and 0 82 64
claims 0 82 64
“Brett’s 0 82 64
assault 0 82 64
on 0 82 64
me 0 82 64
drastically 1 82 64
altered 1 82 64
my 1 82 64
life,” 1 82 64
but 0 82 64
at 0 82 64
the 0 82 64
same 0 82 64
time 0 82 64
acknowledges 0 82 64
“Brett 0 82 64
did 0 82 64
not 0 82 64
rape 0 82 64
me.” 0 82 64

Given 0 82 65
that 0 82 65
Kavanaugh 0 82 65
has 0 82 65
already 0 82 65
passed 0 82 65
six 0 82 65
incredibly 0 82 65
intrusive 0 82 65
FBI 0 82 65
investigations, 0 82 65
odds 0 82 65
are 0 82 65
Ford 1 82 65
is 1 82 65
lying 1 82 65
or 1 82 65
suffering 1 82 65
from 1 82 65
some 1 82 65
kind 1 82 65
of 1 82 65
psychological 1 82 65
disorder 1 82 65
such 1 82 65
as 1 82 65
false 1 82 65
memory 1 82 65
syndrome. 1 82 65

Many 0 82 66
commentators 0 82 66
have 0 82 66
drawn 0 82 66
parallels 0 82 66
between 0 82 66
Ford 0 82 66
and 0 82 66
Anita 0 82 66
Hill, 0 82 66
who 0 82 66
in 0 82 66
1991 0 82 66
accused 0 82 66
then-Supreme 0 82 66
Court 0 82 66
nominee 0 82 66
Clarence 0 82 66
Thomas 0 82 66
of 0 82 66
sexual 0 82 66
improprieties. 0 82 66

Both 0 82 67
women 0 82 67
are 0 82 67
college 0 82 67
professors. 0 82 67

Both 0 82 68
claim 0 82 68
to 0 82 68
have 0 82 68
reluctantly 0 82 68
been 0 82 68
drawn 0 82 68
into 0 82 68
confirmation 0 82 68
battles. 0 82 68

Ford 0 82 69
claims 0 82 69
to 0 82 69
be 0 82 69
a 0 82 69
victim 0 82 69
of 0 82 69
attempted 0 82 69
rape; 0 82 69
Hill 0 82 69
claims 0 82 69
to 0 82 69
have 0 82 69
been 0 82 69
a 0 82 69
victim 0 82 69
of 0 82 69
sexual 0 82 69
harassment 0 82 69
in 0 82 69
the 0 82 69
workplace. 0 82 69

Only 0 82 70
left-wingers 1 82 70
and 1 82 70
feminists 1 82 70
like 1 82 70
Maureen 1 82 70
Dowd 1 82 70
still 0 82 70
believe 0 82 70
Hill, 0 82 70
now 0 82 70
an 0 82 70
utterly 1 82 70
undistinguished 1 82 70
politically 1 82 70
correct 1 82 70
scholar 1 82 70
who 0 82 70
discredited 0 82 70
herself 0 82 70
by 0 82 70
–among 0 82 70
other 0 82 70
things— 0 82 70
following 0 82 70
her 0 82 70
then-boss 0 82 70
Thomas 0 82 70
as 0 82 70
his 0 82 70
subordinate 0 82 70
when 0 82 70
he 0 82 70
switched 0 82 70
jobs. 0 82 70

An 0 82 71
abused 0 82 71
person 0 82 71
wouldn’t 0 82 71
do 0 82 71
that. 0 82 71

But 0 82 72
all 0 82 72
the 0 82 72
lies 0 82 72
about 0 82 72
Thomas 0 82 72
at 0 82 72
what 0 82 72
he 0 82 72
described 0 82 72
as 0 82 72
a 0 82 72
“high-tech 1 82 72
lynching 1 82 72
for 1 82 72
uppity 1 82 72
blacks” 1 82 72
had 0 82 72
an 0 82 72
effect. 0 82 72

In 0 82 73
the 0 82 73
end, 0 82 73
the 0 82 73
Senate 0 82 73
barely 0 82 73
approved 0 82 73
his 0 82 73
nomination 0 82 73
52 0 82 73
to 0 82 73
48 0 82 73
on 0 82 73
October 0 82 73
15, 0 82 73
1991. 0 82 73

With 0 82 74
all 0 82 74
the 0 82 74
mud 1 82 74
Democrats 1 82 74
have 1 82 74
been 1 82 74
slinging 1 82 74
at 1 82 74
Kavanaugh, 0 82 74
he 0 82 74
would 0 82 74
be 0 82 74
thrilled 0 82 74
to 0 82 74
be 0 82 74
approved 0 82 74
by 0 82 74
a 0 82 74
margin 0 82 74
as 0 82 74
wide 0 82 74
as 0 82 74
52 0 82 74
to 0 82 74
48. 0 82 74

Conservatives 0 82 75
need 0 82 75
to 0 82 75
remember 0 82 75
that 0 82 75
the 1 82 75
purpose 1 82 75
of 1 82 75
the 1 82 75
Left’s 1 82 75
frenzied, 1 82 75
demagogic 1 82 75
assault 1 82 75
is 1 82 75
to 1 82 75
damage 1 82 75
the 1 82 75
nominee, 1 82 75
and 1 82 75
by 1 82 75
extension, 1 82 75
the 1 82 75
president 1 82 75
who 1 82 75
nominated 1 82 75
him. 1 82 75

If 0 82 76
they 0 82 76
can 0 82 76
derail 0 82 76
Kavanaugh’s 0 82 76
nomination, 0 82 76
that 0 82 76
is 0 82 76
an 0 82 76

The 0 82 80
case 0 82 80
against 0 82 80
confirming 0 82 80
Kavanaugh 0 82 80
may 0 82 80
be 0 82 80
somewhere 0 82 80
between 0 82 80
weak 0 82 80
and 0 82 80
non-existent, 0 82 80

the 0 82 80
constant 0 82 80

the 0 82 80

clearly 0 82 80
taking 0 82 80
its 0 82 80
toll 0 82 80
on 0 82 80
the 0 82 80
nominee. 0 82 80

That 0 82 81
said, 0 82 81
the 0 82 81
Senate 0 82 81
Judiciary 0 82 81

time 0 372 50
Ellison 0 372 50
has 0 372 50
faced 0 372 50
misconduct 0 372 50
allegations. 0 372 50

In 0 372 51
2006, 0 372 51
a 0 372 51
woman 0 372 51
named 0 372 51
Amy 0 372 51
Alexandar 0 372 51
claimed 0 372 51
that 0 372 51
Ellison 0 372 51
ostracized 0 372 51
her 0 372 51
and 0 372 51
smeared 0 372 51
her 0 372 51
name 0 372 51
after 0 372 51
having 0 372 51
an 0 372 51
extramarital 0 372 51
affair 0 372 51
with 0 372 51
her 0 372 51
in 0 372 51
the 0 372 51
1990s 0 372 51
and 0 372 51
then 0 372 51
again 0 372 51
in 0 372 51
the 0 372 51
2000s. 0 372 51

Ellison 0 372 52
in 0 372 52
2005 0 372 52
filed 0 372 52
a 0 372 52
restraining 0 372 52
order 0 372 52
against 0 372 52
her 0 372 52
after 0 372 52
what 0 372 52
he 0 372 52
described 0 372 52
as 0 372 52
phone 0 372 52
and 0 372 52
email 0 372 52
harassment. 0 372 52

She 0 372 53
subsequently 0 372 53
tried 0 372 53
to 0 372 53
get 0 372 53
a 0 372 53
restraining 0 372 53
order 0 372 53
against 0 372 53
him, 0 372 53
which 0 372 53
a 0 372 53
judge 0 372 53
denied, 0 372 53
ordering 0 372 53
her 0 372 53
to 0 372 53
stop 0 372 53
repeating 0 372 53
allegations 0 372 53
of 0 372 53
an 0 372 53
affair 0 372 53
or 0 372 53
intimidation. 0 372 53

Ellison 0 372 54
subsequently 0 372 54
agreed 0 372 54
to 0 372 54
dismiss 0 372 54
his 0 372 54
restraining 0 372 54
order 0 372 54
against 0 372 54
her 0 372 54
if 0 372 54
she 0 372 54
no 0 372 54
longer 0 372 54
contacted 0 372 54
him. 0 372 54

I'm 0 372 55
not 0 372 55
sure 0 372 55
that 0 372 55
this 0 372 55
is 0 372 55
nothing 0 372 55
more 0 372 55
than 0 372 55
damage 0 372 55
control 0 372 55
just 0 372 55
before 0 372 55
the 0 372 55
elections. 0 372 55

Ellison 0 372 56
won 0 372 56
the 0 372 56
primary 0 372 56
days 0 372 56
after 0 372 56
the 0 372 56
allegations 0 372 56
were 0 372 56
made 0 372 56
public. 0 372 56

Of 0 372 57
course, 0 372 57
accusations 0 372 57
does 0 372 57
not 0 372 57
make 0 372 57
one 0 372 57
guilty 0 372 57
for 0 372 57
Ellison 0 372 57
anymore 0 372 57
than 0 372 57
they 0 372 57
do 0 372 57
for 0 372 57
Judge 0 372 57
Kavanaugh. 0 372 57

However, 0 372 58
at 0 372 58
least 0 372 58
in 0 372 58
the 0 372 58
case 0 372 58
of 0 372 58
Ellison, 0 372 58
at 0 372 58
least 0 372 58
one 0 372 58
of 0 372 58
the 0 372 58
women 0 372 58
were 0 372 58
not 0 372 58
scared 0 372 58
about 0 372 58
their 0 372 58
reputation 0 372 58
and 0 372 58
had 0 372 58
any 0 372 58
political 0 372 58
motive 0 372 58
to 0 372 58
call 0 372 58
the 0 372 58
police 0 372 58
and 0 372 58
file 0 372 58
a 0 372 58
report. 0 372 58

When 0 372 59
it 0 372 59
comes 0 372 59
to 0 372 59
Ellison 0 372 59
though, 0 372 59
we 0 372 59
know 0 372 59
he 0 372 59
is 0 372 59
an 0 372 59

answer 0 372 59
to 0 372 59
the 0 372 59
American 1 372 59

and 0 372 59
even 0 372 59

Court. 0 373 2

Since 0 373 3
then, 0 373 3
there 0 373 3
have 0 373 3
been 0 373 3
numerous 0 373 3
allegations 0 373 3
of 0 373 3
sexual 0 373 3
misconduct 0 373 3
levied 0 373 3
toward 0 373 3

Whether 0 373 4
or 0 373 4

he 0 373 4
is 0 373 4

is 0 373 4
left 0 373 4
to 0 373 4

determined. 0 373 4

However, 0 373 5
it 0 373 5
does 0 373 5
serve 0 373 5
as 0 373 5
a 0 373 5
great 0 373 5
distraction 0 373 5
from 0 373 5
his 0 373 5
actual 0 373 5
constitution-hating 1 373 5
and 1 373 5
tyrannical 1 373 5
tendencies. 1 373 5

While 0 373 6
Kavanaugh 0 373 6
may 0 373 6
be 0 373 6
an 0 373 6
ostensible 0 373 6
supporter 0 373 6
of 0 373 6
the 0 373 6
Second 0 373 6
Amendment, 0 373 6
his 1 373 6
record 1 373 6
indicates 1 373 6
that 1 373 6
he 1 373 6
all 1 373 6
but 1 373 6
cannot 1 373 6
stand 1 373 6
the 1 373 6
Fourth 1 373 6
and 1 373 6
he’s 1 373 6
not 1 373 6
that 1 373 6
big 1 373 6
a 1 373 6
fan 1 373 6
of 1 373 6

While 0 373 7
the 0 373 7
allegations 0 373 7
against 0 373 7
Kavanaugh 0 373 7
should 0 373 7
certainly 0 373 7
be 0 373 7

no 0 373 7

how 0 373 7

he 1 373 7
shouldn’t 1 373 7
even 1 373 7
be 1 373 7
in 1 373 7
this 1 373 7

On 0 373 21
multiple 0 373 21
occasions, 0 373 21
Kavanaugh 0 373 21
has 0 373 21
been 0 373 21
the 0 373 21
lone 0 373 21
voice 0 373 21
when 0 373 21
it 0 373 21

warrantlessly 0 373 21

As 0 373 22
Reason 0 373 22
points 0 373 22
out, 0 373 22
in 0 373 22
2010 0 373 22
he 0 373 22
dissented 0 373 22
from 0 373 22
the 0 373 22
D.C. 0 373 22
Circuit’s 0 373 22

not 0 373 22
to 0 373 22
rehear 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
case 0 373 22
in 0 373 22
which 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
three-judge 0 373 22
panel 0 373 22
had 0 373 22
ruled 0 373 22
that 0 373 22
police 0 373 22
violated 0 373 22
a 0 373 22

drug 0 373 22
dealer’s 0 373 22
Fourth 0 373 22
Amendment 0 373 22
rights 0 373 22
when 0 373 22
they 0 373 22
tracked 0 373 22
his 0 373 22
movements 0 373 22
for 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
month 0 373 22

to 0 373 22
his 0 373 22
car 0 373 22
without 0 373 22
a 0 373 22
warrant. 0 373 22

Kavanaugh 0 373 23
claimed 0 373 23
that 0 373 23
putting 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
GPS 0 373 23

without 0 373 23
first 0 373 23
obtaining 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
warrant 0 373 23
was 0 373 23
just 0 373 23
fine 0 373 23
because 0 373 23
it 0 373 23
didn’t 0 373 23
constitute 0 373 23
a 0 373 23
“search” 0 373 23
as 0 373 23
defined 0 373 23
by 0 373 23
the 0 373 23
Fourth 0 373 23
Amendment. 0 373 23

To 0 373 24
Kavanaugh, 0 373 24
bypassing 0 373 24
the 0 373 24
courts 0 373 24
and 0 373 24
tracking 0 373 24
an 0 373 24
individual 0 373 24
without 0 373 24
their 0 373 24
consent 0 373 24
is 0 373 24
“constitutional.” 0 373 24
In 0 373 24
this 0 373 24
line 0 373 24
of 0 373 24
thinking, 0 373 24
the 0 373 24
Fourth 0 373 24
Amendment 0 373 24
is 0 373 24
not 0 373 24
violated 0 373 24
even 0 373 24
if 0 373 24
police 0 373 24
trespass 0 373 24
on 0 373 24
someone’s 0 373 24
physical 0 373 24
property, 0 373 24
or 0 373 24
track 0 373 24
someone’s 0 373 24
cell 0 373 24
phone. 0 373 24

Luckily, 0 373 25
he 0 373 25
was 0 373 25
the 0 373 25
only 0 373 25
judge 0 373 25
on 0 373 25
the 0 373 25
panel 0 373 25
to 0 373 25
think 0 373 25
this. 0 373 25

In 0 373 26
June, 0 373 26
the 0 373 26
Supreme 0 373 26
Court 0 373 26
ruled 0 373 26
specifically 0 373 26
on 0 373 26
this 0 373 26
case 0 373 26
noting 0 373 26
that 0 373 26
collecting 0 373 26
such 0 373 26
information 0 373 26
actually 0 373 26
does 0 373 26
constitute 0 373 26
a 0 373 26
search 0 373 26
and 0 373 26
therefore 0 373 26
requires 0 373 26
a 0 373 26
warrant. 0 373 26

But 0 373 27
it 0 373 27
gets 0 373 27
worse. 0 373 27

In 0 373 28
2015, 0 373 28
Kavanaugh 0 373 28
issued 0 373 28
a 0 373 28
statement 0 373 28
strongly 0 373 28
defending 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
NSA’s 0 373 28
phone 0 373 28
metadata 0 373 28
collection 0 373 28
program, 0 373 28
arguing 0 373 28
that 0 373 28
it 0 373 28
is 0 373 28
“entirely 0 373 28
consistent 0 373 28
with 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
Fourth 0 373 28
Amendment.” 0 373 28
To 0 373 28
Kavanaugh, 0 373 28
sweeping 0 373 28
programs 0 373 28
that 0 373 28
collect 0 373 28
information 0 373 28
from 0 373 28
innocent 0 373 28
citizens’ 0 373 28
phones 0 373 28
are 0 373 28
not 0 373 28
in 0 373 28
conflict 0 373 28
with 0 373 28
having 0 373 28
the 0 373 28
right 0 373 28
to 0 373 28
be 0 373 28
free 0 373 28
from 0 373 28
unlawful 0 373 28
search 0 373 28
and 0 373 28
seizure. 0 373 28

Seriously. 1 373 29

According 0 373 30
to 0 373 30
Kavanaugh, 0 373 30
the 0 373 30
Fourth 0 373 30
Amendment 0 373 30
allows 0 373 30
for 0 373 30
searches 0 373 30
“without 0 373 30
individualized 0 373 30
suspicion” 0 373 30
when 0 373 30
the 0 373 30
government 0 373 30
demonstrates 0 373 30
a 0 373 30
“special 0 373 30
need” 0 373 30
that 0 373 30
“outweighs 0 373 30
the 0 373 30
intrusion 0 373 30
on 0 373 30
individual 0 373 30
liberty.” 0 373 30

Exactly 0 373 31
what 0 373 31
this 0 373 31
“special 0 373 31
need” 0 373 31
is 0 373 31
that 0 373 31
can 0 373 31
constitute 0 373 31
a 0 373 31
Gestapo 1 373 31
like 1 373 31
police 1 373 31
state 1 373 31
surveilling 1 373 31
its 0 373 31
own 0 373 31
citizens 0 373 31
is 0 373 31
a 0 373 31
moving 0 373 31
target 0 373 31
that 0 373 31
has 0 373 31
already 0 373 31
been 0 373 31
proven 0 373 31
to 0 373 31
be 0 373 31
abused 0 373 31
over 0 373 31
and 0 373 31
over 0 373 31
again. 0 373 31

“The 0 373 32
sacrifice 0 373 32
of 0 373 32
our 0 373 32
personal 0 373 32
liberty 0 373 32
for 0 373 32
security 0 373 32
is 0 373 32
and 0 373 32
will 0 373 32
forever 0 373 32
be 0 373 32
a 0 373 32
false 0 373 32
choice,” 0 373 32
Senator 0 373 32
Rand 0 373 32
Paul 0 373 32
said 0 373 32
of 0 373 32
Kavanaugh’s 0 373 32
views 0 373 32
on 0 373 32
the 0 373 32
disposable 0 373 32
nature 0 373 32
of 0 373 32
the 0 373 32
constitution. 0 373 32

Kavanaugh 0 373 33
“has 0 373 33
no 0 373 33
qualms 0 373 33
about 0 373 33
applying 0 373 33

to 0 373 33
the 0 373 33
digital 0 373 33
age, 0 373 33
and 0 373 33
he 0 373 33
has 0 373 33
endorsed 0 373 33
the 0 373 33
idea 0 373 33
of 0 373 33
a 0 373 33
“counterterrorism 0 373 33
exception” 0 373 33
to 0 373 33
the 0 373 33
Fourth 0 373 33
Amendment’s 0 373 33
warrant 0 373 33
requirement,” 0 373 33
said 0 373 33

While 0 373 34
the 0 373 34
left 0 373 34
is 0 373 34
calling 0 373 34
for 0 373 34

to 1 373 34

executed 1 373 34
over 1 373 34
the 1 373 34

alleged 0 373 34
victims, 0 373 34
others 0 373 34
in 0 373 34

who 0 373 34
see 0 373 34

the 0 373 34
facade 0 373 34
and 0 373 34
media 0 373 34

are 0 373 34
trying 0 373 34
to 0 373 34
draw 0 373 34
attention 0 373 34
to 0 373 34
the 0 373 34
fact 0 373 34
that 0 373 34
Kavanaugh 0 373 34
is 0 373 34
a 0 373 34
champion 1 373 34
of 1 373 34
the 1 373 34
police 1 373 34
and 1 373 34
surveillance 1 373 34
state 1 373 34
and 1 373 34
an 1 373 34
enemy 1 373 34
to 1 373 34
privacy. 1 373 34

Representative 0 373 35
Justin 0 373 35
Amash 0 373 35
does 0 373 35
not 0 373 35
have 0 373 35
a 0 373 35
vote 0 373 35
on 0 373 35
whether 0 373 35
or 0 373 35
not 0 373 35
Kavanaugh 0 373 35
will 0 373 35
be 0 373 35
appointed. 0 373 35

However, 0 373 36
this 0 373 36
hasn’t 0 373 36
prevented 0 373 36
him 0 373 36
from 0 373 36
becoming 0 373 36
the 0 373 36
only 0 373 36
Republican 0 373 36
to 0 373 36
speak 0 373 36
out 0 373 36
against 0 373 36
the 0 373 36
real 0 373 36
reasons 0 373 36
he 0 373 36
should 0 373 36
not 0 373 36
be 0 373 36
appointed 0 373 36
to 0 373 36
Supreme 0 373 36
Court. 0 373 36

“Privacy 1 373 37
advocates 1 373 37
must 1 373 37
fight,” 1 373 37
Amash 0 373 37
tweeted. 0 373 37

“There 0 373 38
are 0 373 38
many 0 373 38
potential 0 373 38
nominees 0 373 38
with 0 373 38
a 0 373 38
conservative 0 373 38
record 0 373 38
on 0 373 38
abortion, 0 373 38
guns, 0 373 38
and 0 373 38
regulations. 0 373 38

The 1 373 39
only 1 373 39
question 1 373 39
is 1 373 39
will 1 373 39
the 1 373 39
Senate 1 373 39
confirm 1 373 39
one 1 373 39
who 1 373 39
is 1 373 39
really 1 373 39
bad 1 373 39
on 1 373 39
the 1 373 39

in 0 373 39
upcoming 0 373 39

battles.” 0 373 39

Indeed, 0 373 40
as 0 373 40
technology 0 373 40
increases, 0 373 40
so 0 373 40
does 0 373 40
the 0 373 40
desire 0 373 40
of 0 373 40
the 0 373 40
state 0 373 40
to 0 373 40
use 0 373 40
it 0 373 40
to 0 373 40

us. 0 373 40

The 0 373 41

headed 0 373 41
to 0 373 41

supreme 0 373 41

in 0 373 41

what 0 373 41
constitutes 0 373 41
an 0 373 41
unconstitutional 0 373 41
search 0 373 41
will 0 373 41
undoubtedly 0 373 41
be 0 373 41
vast 0 373 41
in 0 373 41
number 0 373 41
and 0 373 41
detrimental 0 373 41
in 0 373 41

Americans 0 373 41
get 0 373 41

As 0 373 42
for 0 373 42
if 0 373 42
Kavanaugh 0 373 42
gets 0 373 42
appointed, 0 373 42
Amash 0 373 42
has 0 373 42
some 0 373 42
harsh 0 373 42
words 0 373 42
to 0 373 42
those 0 373 42
who 0 373 42

lines: 0 373 42

“When 1 373 43

to 0 374 28

“This 0 374 28
is 0 374 28
not 0 374 28

you 0 374 28

did 0 374 28
not 0 374 28
happen. 0 374 28

She 0 374 29

in 0 374 31

that 0 374 31

an 0 374 31

chairman 0 374 32
of 0 374 32
the 0 374 32

Tuesday 0 374 32
that 0 374 32
the 0 374 32
party’s 0 374 32
investigation 0 374 32
of 0 374 32
the 0 374 32
allegations 0 374 32
against 0 374 32
Ellison 0 374 32
will 0 374 32
be 0 374 32
finished 0 374 32
soon, 0 374 32
then 0 374 32
released 0 374 32
to 0 374 32
the 0 374 32
public. 0 374 32

An 0 374 33
external 0 374 33

was 0 374 33
hired 0 374 33
to 0 374 33
conduct 0 374 33
the 0 374 33
inquiry. 0 374 33

The 0 374 34
Star 0 374 34
Tribune 0 374 34
argued 0 374 34
that, 0 374 34
given 0 374 34
the 0 374 34
public 0 374 34
interest 0 374 34
around 0 374 34
that 0 374 34

her 0 374 34
ex-husband, 0 374 34
the 0 374 34
divorce 0 374 34
records 0 374 34
are 0 374 34
a 0 374 34
matter 0 374 34
of 0 374 34
concern 0 374 34
to 0 374 34
voters. 0 374 34

Divorce 0 374 35
records 0 374 35
are 0 374 35
typically 0 374 35
public, 0 374 35
but 0 374 35
judges 0 374 35
will 0 374 35
often 0 374 35
agree 0 374 35
to 0 374 35
seal 0 374 35
them 0 374 35
if 0 374 35
both 0 374 35
parties 0 374 35
to 0 374 35
the 0 374 35
case 0 374 35
agree 0 374 35
and 0 374 35
no 0 374 35
one 0 374 35
else 0 374 35
objects. 0 374 35

The 0 374 36
Ellison 0 374 36
campaign 0 374 36
released 0 374 36
a 0 374 36
statement 0 374 36
from 0 374 36
Kim 0 374 36
Ellison 0 374 36
on 0 374 36

of 0 374 36
both 0 374 36
her 0 374 36
and 0 374 36
Keith 0 374 36
Ellison. 0 374 36

“Our 0 374 37

and 0 374 37
therefore, 0 374 37
when 0 374 37
we 0 374 37

we 0 374 37

Kavanaugh 1 376 11
stole 1 376 11
the 1 376 11
show. 1 376 11

The 0 376 12
judge 0 376 12
forcefully 0 376 12
stood 0 376 12
up 0 376 12
for 0 376 12
himself 0 376 12
as 0 376 12
his 0 376 12
voice 0 376 12
trembled 1 376 12
with 1 376 12
righteous 1 376 12
indignation, 1 376 12
calling 0 376 12
out 0 376 12
Democratic 0 376 12
senators 0 376 12
for 0 376 12
plotting 0 376 12
against 0 376 12
him. 0 376 12

The 0 376 13
behavior 0 376 13
of 0 376 13
several 0 376 13
of 0 376 13
the 0 376 13
Democratic 0 376 13
members 0 376 13
of 0 376 13
this 0 376 13
committee 0 376 13
at 0 376 13
my 0 376 13
hearing 0 376 13
a 0 376 13
few 0 376 13
weeks 0 376 13
ago 0 376 13
was 0 376 13
an 0 376 13
embarrassment. 0 376 13

But 0 376 14
at 0 376 14
least 0 376 14
it 0 376 14
was 0 376 14
just 0 376 14
a 0 376 14
good 0 376 14
old-fashioned 0 376 14
attempt 0 376 14
at 0 376 14
Borking. 0 376 14

Those 0 376 15
efforts 0 376 15
didn't 0 376 15
work. 0 376 15

When 0 376 16
I 0 376 16
did 0 376 16
at 0 376 16
least 0 376 16
okay 0 376 16
enough 0 376 16
at 0 376 16
the 0 376 16
hearings 0 376 16
that 0 376 16
it 0 376 16
looked 0 376 16
like 0 376 16
I 0 376 16
might 0 376 16
actually 0 376 16
get 0 376 16
confirmed, 0 376 16
a 0 376 16
new 0 376 16
tactic 0 376 16
was 0 376 16
needed. 0 376 16

Some 0 376 17
of 0 376 17
you 0 376 17
were 0 376 17
lying 0 376 17
in 0 376 17
wait 0 376 17
and 0 376 17
had 0 376 17
it 0 376 17
ready. 0 376 17

This 0 376 18
first 0 376 18
allegation 0 376 18
was 0 376 18
held 0 376 18
in 0 376 18
secret 0 376 18
for 0 376 18
weeks 0 376 18
by 0 376 18
a 0 376 18
Democratic 0 376 18
member 0 376 18
of 0 376 18
this 0 376 18
committee, 0 376 18
and 0 376 18
by 0 376 18
staff. 0 376 18

It 0 376 19
would 0 376 19
be 0 376 19
needed 0 376 19
only 0 376 19
if 0 376 19
you 0 376 19
couldn't 0 376 19
take 0 376 19
me 0 376 19
out 0 376 19
on 0 376 19
the 0 376 19
merits. 0 376 19

When 0 376 20
it 0 376 20
was 0 376 20
needed, 0 376 20
this 0 376 20
allegation 0 376 20
was 0 376 20
unleashed 0 376 20
and 0 376 20
publicly 0 376 20
deployed 0 376 20
over 0 376 20
Dr. 0 376 20
Ford's 0 376 20
wishes. 0 376 20

And 0 376 21
then, 0 376 21
and 1 376 21
then 1 376 21
as 0 376 21
no 0 376 21
doubt 0 376 21
was 0 376 21
expected, 0 376 21
if 0 376 21
not 0 376 21
planned, 0 376 21
came 0 376 21
a 0 376 21
long 0 376 21
series 0 376 21
of 0 376 21
false 0 376 21
last-minute 1 376 21
smears 1 376 21
designed 0 376 21
to 0 376 21
scare 0 376 21
me 0 376 21
and 0 376 21
drive 0 376 21
me 0 376 21
out 0 376 21
of 0 376 21
the 0 376 21
process 0 376 21
before 0 376 21
any 0 376 21
hearing 0 376 21
occurred. 0 376 21

Afraid 1 376 22
of 1 376 22
their 1 376 22
own 1 376 22
shadows, 1 376 22
committee 0 376 22
Republicans 0 376 22
didn’t 0 376 22
relish 0 376 22
the 0 376 22
prospect 0 376 22
of 0 376 22
their 0 376 22
all-male 1 376 22
team 1 376 22
of 0 376 22
11 0 376 22
senators 0 376 22
questioning 0 376 22
a 0 376 22
woman 0 376 22
so 0 376 22
they 0 376 22
hired 0 376 22
sex-crimes 0 376 22
prosecutor 0 376 22
Rachel 0 376 22
Mitchell 0 376 22
of 0 376 22
Maricopa 0 376 22
County, 0 376 22
Arizona, 0 376 22
to 0 376 22
examine 0 376 22
Ford. 0 376 22

Opinions 0 376 23
differ 0 376 23
widely 0 376 23
on 0 376 23
how 0 376 23
Mitchell 0 376 23
performed. 0 376 23

She 0 376 24
tiptoed 0 376 24
around 0 376 24
the 0 376 24
alleged 0 376 24
sexual 0 376 24
assault 0 376 24
itself, 0 376 24
instead 0 376 24
focusing 0 376 24
on 0 376 24
process-related 0 376 24
questions, 0 376 24
presumably 0 376 24
in 0 376 24
an 0 376 24
effort 0 376 24
to 0 376 24
show 0 376 24
undecided 0 376 24
senators 0 376 24
how 0 376 24
Ford 0 376 24
and 0 376 24
her 0 376 24
handlers 0 376 24
have 0 376 24
been 0 376 24
unfairly 0 376 24
manipulating 0 376 24
the 0 376 24
process. 0 376 24

In 0 376 25
much 0 376 25
of 0 376 25
her 0 376 25
testimony, 0 376 25
Ford 0 376 25
came 0 376 25
across 0 376 25
as 0 376 25
presentable 0 376 25
and 0 376 25
seemingly 0 376 25
credible, 0 376 25
though 0 376 25
vague 0 376 25
and 0 376 25
sometimes 0 376 25
evasive, 0 376 25
her 0 376 25
ridiculous 1 376 25
overall 1 376 25
story 1 376 25
notwithstanding. 0 376 25

Ford 0 376 26
did 0 376 26
well 0 376 26
enough 0 376 26
that 0 376 26
during 0 376 26
the 0 376 26
break 0 376 26
between 0 376 26
her 0 376 26
testimony 0 376 26
and 0 376 26
Kavanaugh’s, 0 376 26
commentators 0 376 26
on 0 376 26

the 0 376 26
nominee 0 376 26
withdrawing, 0 376 26
opinions 0 376 26

were 0 376 26
sharply 0 376 26
reversed 0 376 26

It’s 0 376 27
not 0 376 27
that 0 376 27
Mitchell 0 376 27
did 0 376 27
a 0 376 27
bad 0 376 27
job 0 376 27
creating 0 376 27
an 0 376 27
inventory 0 376 27
of 0 376 27
the 0 376 27
irregularities 0 376 27
in 0 376 27
the 0 376 27
process 0 376 27
and 0 376 27
of 0 376 27
the 0 376 27
odd 0 376 27
behavior 0 376 27
of 0 376 27
Ford 0 376 27
and 0 376 27
her 0 376 27
lawyers. 0 376 27

She 0 376 28
could 0 376 28
do 0 376 28
little 0 376 28
else. 0 376 28

She 0 376 29
had 0 376 29
many 0 376 29
restrictions 0 376 29
placed 0 376 29
upon 0 376 29
her 0 376 29
and 0 376 29
was 0 376 29
only 0 376 29
allowed 0 376 29
to 0 376 29
question 0 376 29
Ford 0 376 29
for 0 376 29
minutes 0 376 29
at 0 376 29
a 0 376 29
time 0 376 29
before 0 376 29
surrendering 0 376 29
the 0 376 29
floor 0 376 29
to 0 376 29
the 0 376 29
next 0 376 29
committee 0 376 29
Democrat. 0 376 29

As 0 376 30
commentator 0 376 30
Sean 0 376 30
Davis 0 376 30
tweeted: 0 376 30

“Hard 1 376 31
to 1 376 31
do 1 376 31
much 1 376 31
else 1 376 31
when 1 376 31
the 1 376 31
witness 1 376 31
conveniently 1 376 31
has 1 376 31
no 1 376 31
corroborating 1 376 31
evidence, 1 376 31
no 1 376 31
memory 1 376 31
of 1 376 31
any 1 376 31
verifiable 1 376 31
facts 1 376 31
of 1 376 31
what 1 376 31
happened, 1 376 31
and 1 376 31
everyone 1 376 31
she 1 376 31
says 1 376 31
was 1 376 31
present 1 376 31
at 1 376 31
the 1 376 31
alleged 1 376 31
incident--even 1 376 31
her 1 376 31
best 1 376 31
friend--has 1 376 31
denied 1 376 31
it.” 1 376 31

Nonetheless, 0 376 32
Mitchell’s 0 376 32
questioning 0 376 32
came 0 376 32
across 0 376 32
at 0 376 32
times 0 376 32
as 0 376 32
perfunctory, 0 376 32
leading 0 376 32
many 0 376 32
observers 0 376 32
to 0 376 32
conclude 0 376 32
that 0 376 32
Republicans 0 376 32
threw 0 376 32
away 0 376 32
a 0 376 32
valuable 0 376 32
opportunity 0 376 32
by 0 376 32
using 0 376 32
her 0 376 32
as 0 376 32
a 0 376 32
stand-in. 0 376 32

She 0 376 33
failed 0 376 33
to 0 376 33
lay 0 376 33
a 0 376 33
glove 0 376 33
on 0 376 33
a 0 376 33
witness 0 376 33
whose 0 376 33
implausible, 0 376 33
internally 0 376 33
contradictory 0 376 33
story 0 376 33
cried 1 376 33
out 1 376 33
for 1 376 33
vigorous 1 376 33
cross-examination. 1 376 33

In 0 376 34
the 0 376 34
end 0 376 34
the 0 376 34
too-deferential, 0 376 34
easygoing 0 376 34
Mitchell 0 376 34
failed 0 376 34
to 0 376 34
provide 0 376 34
much, 0 376 34
if 0 376 34
anything, 0 376 34
in 0 376 34
the 0 376 34
way 0 376 34
of 0 376 34
evidence 0 376 34
against 0 376 34
Ford 0 376 34
or 0 376 34
in 0 376 34
favor 0 376 34
of 0 376 34
Kavanaugh. 0 376 34

Whether 0 376 35
her 0 376 35
work 0 376 35
will 0 376 35
bring 0 376 35
over 0 376 35
fence-sitting 0 376 35
senators 0 376 35
to 0 376 35
Kavanaugh’s 0 376 35
side 0 376 35
remains 0 376 35
to 0 376 35
be 0 376 35
seen. 0 376 35

Like 0 376 36
other 0 376 36
Democrats, 0 376 36
Sen. 0 376 36
Mazie 0 376 36
Hirono 0 376 36
of 0 376 36
Hawaii 0 376 36
tried 0 376 36
to 0 376 36
help 0 376 36
Ford, 0 376 36
lobbing 1 376 36
her 1 376 36
softballs. 1 376 36

After 0 376 37
saying 0 376 37
she 0 376 37
thought 0 376 37
she 0 376 37
knew 0 376 37
what 0 376 37
Mitchell 0 376 37
was 0 376 37
trying 0 376 37
to 0 376 37
get 0 376 37
at 0 376 37
in 0 376 37
her 0 376 37
questions, 0 376 37
the 0 376 37
senator 0 376 37
said, 0 376 37
“so 0 376 37
I'll 0 376 37
just 0 376 37
ask 0 376 37
you 0 376 37
very 0 376 37
plainly, 0 376 37
Dr. 0 376 37
Ford, 0 376 37
is 1 376 37
there 1 376 37
a 1 376 37
political 1 376 37
motivation 1 376 37
for 1 376 37
your 1 376 37
coming 1 376 37
forward 1 376 37
with 1 376 37
your 1 376 37
account 1 376 37
of 1 376 37
the 1 376 37
assault 1 376 37
by 1 376 37
Brett 1 376 37
Kavanaugh?” 1 376 37

“No, 0 376 38
and 0 376 38
I'd 0 376 38
like 0 376 38
to 0 376 38
reiterate 0 376 38
that 0 376 38
again, 0 376 38
I 0 376 38
was 0 376 38
trying 0 376 38
to 0 376 38
get 0 376 38
the 0 376 38
information 0 376 38
to 0 376 38
you 0 376 38
while 0 376 38
there 0 376 38
was 0 376 38
still 0 376 38
a 0 376 38
list 0 376 38
of 0 376 38
other 0 376 38
what 0 376 38
looked 0 376 38
like 0 376 38
equally-qualified 0 376 38
candidates,” 0 376 38
Ford 0 376 38
replied. 0 376 38

When 0 376 39
Sen. 0 376 39
Dick 0 376 39
Durbin 0 376 39
(D-Ill.) 0 376 39
asked 0 376 39
Ford 0 376 39
“with 0 376 39
what 0 376 39
degree 0 376 39
of 0 376 39
certainty 0 376 39
do 0 376 39
you 0 376 39
believe 0 376 39
Brett 0 376 39
Kavanaugh 0 376 39
assaulted 0 376 39
you?” 0 376 39
Ford 0 376 39
replied, 0 376 39
“one 0 376 39
hundred 0 376 39
percent.” 0 376 39

Strangely, 0 376 40
Ford 1 376 40
has 1 376 40
a 1 376 40
bad 1 376 40
long-term 1 376 40
memory 1 376 40
and 1 376 40
a 1 376 40
bad 1 376 40
short-term 1 376 40
memory. 1 376 40

She 0 376 41
doesn’t 0 376 41
know 0 376 41
when 0 376 41
or 0 376 41
where 0 376 41
the 0 376 41
alleged 0 376 41
incident 0 376 41
took 0 376 41
place, 0 376 41
yet 0 376 41
she 0 376 41
is 0 376 41
“one 0 376 41
hundred 0 376 41
percent” 0 376 41
certain 0 376 41
it 0 376 41
was 0 376 41
Kavanaugh 0 376 41
who 0 376 41
attacked 0 376 41
her. 0 376 41

At 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
outset 0 376 42
of 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
hearing, 0 376 42
Grassley 0 376 42
provided 0 376 42
an 0 376 42
overview 0 376 42
of 0 376 42
what 0 376 42
Kavanaugh 0 376 42
had 0 376 42
gone 0 376 42
through 0 376 42
–including 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
Democrats’ 0 376 42
sordid 0 376 42
behavior— 0 376 42
since 0 376 42
President 0 376 42
Trump 0 376 42
announced 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
judge’s 0 376 42
nomination 0 376 42
on 0 376 42
July 0 376 42
9. 0 376 42

As 0 376 43
part 0 376 43
of 0 376 43
the 0 376 43
confirmation 0 376 43
process, 0 376 43
Kavanaugh 0 376 43
endured 0 376 43
his 0 376 43
sixth 0 376 43
background 0 376 43
investigation 0 376 43
since 0 376 43
1993. 0 376 43

“Nowhere 0 376 44
in 0 376 44
any 0 376 44
of 0 376 44
these 0 376 44
six 0 376 44
FBI 0 376 44
reports, 0 376 44
which 0 376 44
committee 0 376 44
investigators 0 376 44
have 0 376 44
reviewed 0 376 44
on 0 376 44
a 0 376 44
bipartisan 0 376 44
basis, 0 376 44
was 0 376 44
there 0 376 44
a 0 376 44
whiff 0 376 44
of 0 376 44
any 0 376 44
issue 0 376 44
– 0 376 44
any 1 376 44
issue 1 376 44
at 0 376 44
all 0 376 44
related 0 376 44
in 0 376 44
any 0 376 44
way 0 376 44
to 0 376 44
inappropriate 0 376 44
sexual 0 376 44
behavior,” 0 376 44
Grassley 0 376 44
said. 0 376 44

Ford 0 376 45
shared 0 376 45
her 0 376 45
allegations 0 376 45
in 0 376 45
a 0 376 45
letter 0 376 45
to 0 376 45
the 0 376 45
committee’s 0 376 45
ranking 0 376 45
member, 0 376 45
Dianne 0 376 45
Feinstein 0 376 45
(D-Calif.), 0 376 45
in 0 376 45
the 0 376 45
summer. 0 376 45

The 0 376 46
letter 0 376 46
remained 0 376 46
secret 0 376 46
from 0 376 46
July 0 376 46
30 0 376 46
through 0 376 46
until 0 376 46
September 0 376 46
13 0 376 46
when 0 376 46
he 0 376 46
first 0 376 46
learned 0 376 46
about 0 376 46
it, 0 376 46
the 0 376 46
chairman 0 376 46
said. 0 376 46

Instead 0 376 47
of 0 376 47
sharing 0 376 47
the 0 376 47
letter 0 376 47
with 0 376 47
the 0 376 47
committee, 0 376 47
Feinstein 0 376 47
did 0 376 47
nothing. 0 376 47

Before 0 376 48
the 0 376 48
hearing, 0 376 48
Kavanaugh 0 376 48
met 0 376 48
privately 0 376 48
with 0 376 48
65 0 376 48
senators, 0 376 48
including 0 376 48
Feinstein, 0 376 48
who 0 376 48
didn’t 0 376 48
ask 0 376 48
him 0 376 48
about 0 376 48
the 0 376 48
allegations 0 376 48
when 0 376 48
she 0 376 48
met 0 376 48
with 0 376 48
him 0 376 48
in 0 376 48
August. 0 376 48

The 0 376 49
committee 0 376 49
held 0 376 49
a 0 376 49
four-day 0 376 49
public 0 376 49
hearing 0 376 49
from 0 376 49
September 0 376 49
4 0 376 49
to 0 376 49
September 0 376 49
7 0 376 49
during 0 376 49
which 0 376 49
Kavanaugh 0 376 49
testified 0 376 49
for 0 376 49
more 0 376 49
than 0 376 49
32 0 376 49
hours 0 376 49
in 0 376 49
public. 0 376 49

Feinstein 0 376 50
didn’t 0 376 50
attend 0 376 50
it, 0 376 50
Grassley 0 376 50
said. 0 376 50

Kavanaugh 0 376 51
answered 0 376 51
almost 0 376 51
1,300 0 376 51
written 0 376 51
questions 0 376 51
senators 0 376 51
submitted 0 376 51
after 0 376 51
the 0 376 51
hearing. 0 376 51

That 0 376 52
is 0 376 52
“more 0 376 52
than 0 376 52
all 0 376 52
prior 0 376 52
Supreme 0 376 52
Court 0 376 52
nominees,” 0 376 52
he 0 376 52
said. 0 376 52

“Throughout 0 376 53
this 0 376 53
period, 0 376 53
we 0 376 53
did 0 376 53
not 0 376 53
know 0 376 53
about 0 376 53
the 0 376 53
ranking 0 376 53
member's 0 376 53
secret 0 376 53
evidence. 0 376 53

Then, 0 376 54
only 0 376 54
at 0 376 54
an 0 376 54
11th 0 376 54
hour, 0 376 54
on 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
eve 0 376 54
of 0 376 54
Judge 0 376 54
Kavanaugh's 0 376 54
confirmation 0 376 54
vote, 0 376 54
did 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
ranking 0 376 54
member 0 376 54
refer 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
allegations 0 376 54
to 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
FBI. 0 376 54

And 0 376 55
then, 0 376 55
sadly, 0 376 55
the 0 376 55
allegations 0 376 55
were 0 376 55
leaked 0 376 55
to 0 376 55
the 0 376 55
press.” 0 376 55

“Every 0 376 56
step 0 376 56
of 0 376 56
the 0 376 56
way 0 376 56
the 0 376 56
Democratic 0 376 56
side 0 376 56
refused 0 376 56
to 0 376 56
participate 0 376 56
in 0 376 56
what 0 376 56
should 0 376 56
have 0 376 56
been 0 376 56
a 0 376 56
bipartisan 0 376 56
investigation,” 0 376 56
Grassley 0 376 56
said. 0 376 56

After 0 376 57
Ford’s 0 376 57
identity 0 376 57
became 0 376 57
public, 0 376 57
Grassley’s 0 376 57
staff 0 376 57
“contacted 0 376 57
all 0 376 57
the 0 376 57
individuals 0 376 57
she 0 376 57
said 0 376 57
attended 0 376 57
the 0 376 57
1982 0 376 57
party 0 376 57
described 0 376 57
in 0 376 57
the 0 376 57
Washington 0 376 57
Post 0 376 57
article,” 0 376 57
he 0 376 57
said. 0 376 57

Kavanaugh 0 376 58
“immediately 0 376 58
submitted 0 376 58
to 0 376 58
an 0 376 58
interview 0 376 58
under 0 376 58
penalty 0 376 58
of 0 376 58
felony 0 376 58
for 0 376 58
any 0 376 58
knowingly 0 376 58
false 0 376 58
statements. 0 376 58

He 0 376 59

about 1 377 18

Senator 1 377 18
Flake? 1 377 18

It's 0 377 19
a 0 377 19
good 0 377 19
thing 0 377 19
he'll 0 377 19
be 0 377 19
leaving 0 377 19
the 0 377 19
Senate. 0 377 19

Perhaps 1 377 20
Arizona 1 377 20
will 1 377 20
put 1 377 20
someone 1 377 20
in 1 377 20
that 1 377 20
actually 1 377 20
has 1 377 20
a 1 377 20
spine 1 377 20
rather 1 377 20
than 1 377 20
living 1 377 20
up 1 377 20

Senator 1 377 20
Flake's 1 377 20
name. 1 377 20

Why 0 377 21
that 0 377 21
investigation 0 377 21
is 0 377 21
needed 0 377 21
is 0 377 21
unclear 0 377 21
since 0 377 21
all 0 377 21
the 0 377 21
people 0 377 21
Dr. 0 377 21
Christine 0 377 21
Ford 0 377 21
named 0 377 21
to 0 377 21
be 0 377 21
at 0 377 21
the 0 377 21
alleged 0 377 21
house 0 377 21
where 0 377 21
the 0 377 21
alleged 0 377 21
attack 0 377 21
took 0 377 21

all 0 377 21
categorically 0 377 21
denied 0 377 21
the 0 377 21
attack 0 377 21
took 0 377 21

including 0 377 21

What 0 378 0
Kavanaugh 0 378 0
Wouldn't: 0 378 0
Christine 0 378 0
Ford 0 378 0
Was 0 378 0
Part 0 378 0
Of 0 378 0

& 0 378 0
Here's 0 378 0
The 0 378 0
Audio 0 378 0
Evidence 0 378 0

On 0 378 1
Thursday, 0 378 1
following 0 378 1
the 0 378 1
hearings 0 378 1
where 0 378 1
Dr. 0 378 1
Christine 0 378 1
Ford 0 378 1
provided 0 378 1
testimony 0 378 1
under 0 378 1
oath 0 378 1
without 0 378 1
any 0 378 1
evidence 0 378 1
at 0 378 1
all 0 378 1
of 0 378 1
a 0 378 1
36-year-old 0 378 1
alleged 0 378 1
sexual 0 378 1
attack 0 378 1
by 0 378 1
Supreme 0 378 1
Court 0 378 1
nominee 0 378 1
Brett 0 378 1
Kavanaugh 0 378 1
and 0 378 1
his 0 378 1
friend 0 378 1
Mark 0 378 1
Judge, 0 378 1
Kavanaugh 0 378 1
denied 0 378 1
the 0 378 1
allegations 0 378 1
and 0 378 1
blasted 1 378 1
Senate 1 378 1
Democrats 1 378 1
for 0 378 1
their 0 378 1
involvement 0 378 1
in 0 378 1
ruining 0 378 1
his 0 378 1
good 0 378 1
name. 0 378 1

However, 0 378 2
when 0 378 2
asked 0 378 2
by 0 378 2
Senator 0 378 2
Cory 0 378 2
Booker 0 378 2
whether 0 378 2
or 0 378 2
not 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
thought 0 378 2
Ford 0 378 2
was 0 378 2
part 0 378 2
of 0 378 2
what 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
referred 0 378 2
to 0 378 2
as 0 378 2
a 0 378 2
"political 1 378 2
hit" 1 378 2
against 0 378 2
him, 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
rightly 0 378 2
steered 0 378 2
clear 0 378 2
of 0 378 2
a 0 378 2
public 1 378 2
relations 1 378 2
disaster. 1 378 2

However, 0 378 3
I 0 378 3
am 0 378 3
willing 0 378 3
to 0 378 3
say 0 378 3
would 0 378 3
he 0 378 3
would 0 378 3
not: 0 378 3
Of 1 378 3
course, 1 378 3
she 1 378 3
was 1 378 3
part 1 378 3
of 1 378 3
it! 1 378 3

I 0 378 4
don't 0 378 4
say 0 378 4
this 0 378 4
lightly. 0 378 4

There 0 378 5
are 0 378 5
many 0 378 5
things 0 378 5
that 0 378 5
we 0 378 5
heard 0 378 5
from 0 378 5
Ford 0 378 5
on 0 378 5
Thursday 0 378 5
that 0 378 5
indicate 0 378 5
there 0 378 5
is 0 378 5
more 0 378 5
going 0 378 5
on 0 378 5
than 0 378 5
she 0 378 5
was 0 378 5
willing 0 378 5
to 0 378 5
say. 0 378 5

Clearly, 0 378 6
Ford 0 378 6
has 0 378 6
been 0 378 6
outed 0 378 6
as 0 378 6
a 1 378 6
radical 1 378 6
political 1 378 6
activist 1 378 6
who 1 378 6
promotes 1 378 6
baby 1 378 6
murder 1 378 6

an 0 378 23
advisor 0 378 23
to 0 378 23
Mrs. 0 378 23
Ford, 0 378 23
said 0 378 23
in 0 378 23
July 0 378 23
(at 0 378 23
roughly 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
same 0 378 23
time 0 378 23
as 0 378 23
the 0 378 23

that 0 378 23
she 0 378 23
predicted 0 378 23
a 0 378 23
"strategy" 0 378 23
forming 0 378 23
to 1 378 23
destroy 1 378 23
Brett 1 378 23
Kavanaugh. 1 378 23

She 0 378 24
suggested 0 378 24
a 0 378 24
“strategy 0 378 24
will 0 378 24
emerge” 0 378 24
to 1 378 24
destroy 1 378 24
Trump's 1 378 24
nomination 1 378 24
for 1 378 24
the 1 378 24
Supreme 1 378 24
Court 1 378 24
in 0 378 24
a 0 378 24

call 0 378 24
with 0 378 24
the 0 378 24
American 0 378 24
Constitution 0 378 24
Society 0 378 24
in 0 378 24

“I 0 378 25
do 0 378 25
think 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
over 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
coming 0 378 25
days 0 378 25
and 0 378 25
weeks 0 378 25
there 0 378 25

a 0 378 25
strategy 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
will 0 378 25
emerge, 0 378 25
and 0 378 25
I 0 378 25
think 0 378 25
it’s 0 378 25
possible 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
strategy 0 378 25
might 0 378 25
ultimately 0 378 25
defeat 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
nominee,” 0 378 25
Seidman 0 378 25
said 0 378 25
in 0 378 25
audio 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
was 0 378 25
recorded 0 378 25
by 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
Republican 0 378 25
National 0 378 25
Committee’s 0 378 25
War 0 378 25
Room. 0 378 25

“And 1 378 26
whether 1 378 26
or 1 378 26
not 1 378 26
it 1 378 26
ultimately 1 378 26
defeats 1 378 26
the 1 378 26
nominee 1 378 26
it 1 378 26
will, 1 378 26
I 1 378 26
think, 1 378 26
help 1 378 26
people 1 378 26
understand 1 378 26
why 1 378 26
it’s 1 378 26
so 1 378 26
important 1 378 26
that 1 378 26
they 1 378 26
vote.” 1 378 26

If 1 378 27
you 1 378 27
think 1 378 27
Mrs. 1 378 27
Ford 1 378 27
is 1 378 27
ignorant 1 378 27
of 1 378 27
this 1 378 27
considering 1 378 27
her 1 378 27
father 1 378 27
works 1 378 27
for 1 378 27
the 1 378 27
Central 1 378 27
Intelligence 1 378 27
Agency 1 378 27
and 1 378 27
her 1 378 27
prior 1 378 27
criminal 1 378 27
political 1 378 27
activism, 1 378 27
then 1 378 27
you 1 378 27
aren't 1 378 27
thinking 1 378 27
clearly. 1 378 27

Ford 1 378 28
obviously 1 378 28
has 1 378 28
mental 1 378 28
issues 1 378 28
and 1 378 28
that 1 378 28
was 1 378 28
on 1 378 28
display 1 378 28
on 1 378 28
Thursday 1 378 28
during 1 378 28
her 1 378 28
testimony. 1 378 28

She 0 378 29
clearly 0 378 29
tried 0 378 29
to 0 378 29
present 0 378 29
herself 0 378 29
as 0 378 29
a 0 378 29
victim 0 378 29
while 0 378 29
she 0 378 29
accused 0 378 29
Kavanaugh 0 378 29
of 0 378 29
sexual 0 378 29
assault 0 378 29
with 0 378 29
absolutely 1 378 29
no 1 378 29
evidence. 1 378 29

Kavanaugh 0 378 30
even 0 378 30
responded 0 378 30
by 0 378 30
pointing 0 378 30
out 0 378 30
that 0 378 30
even 0 378 30
her 0 378 30
friends 0 378 30
said 0 378 30
they 0 378 30
don't 0 378 30
recall 0 378 30
such 0 378 30
an 0 378 30
incident 0 378 30
and 0 378 30
had 0 378 30
literally 0 378 30
hundreds 0 378 30
of 0 378 30
people 0 378 30
commend 0 378 30
his 0 378 30
character 0 378 30
as 0 378 30
the 0 378 30
direct 0 378 30
opposite 0 378 30
of 0 378 30
what 0 378 30
Ford 0 378 30
claims. 0 378 30

As 0 378 31
I've 0 378 31
said 0 378 31
before, 0 378 31
I 0 378 31
don't 0 378 31
support 0 378 31
Kavanaugh's 0 378 31
appointment 0 378 31
to 0 378 31
the 0 378 31
Supreme 0 378 31
Court 0 378 31
on 0 378 31
the 0 378 31
grounds 0 378 31
of 0 378 31
lack 0 378 31
of 0 378 31
constitutional 0 378 31
rulings, 0 378 31
but 0 378 31
that 1 378 31
attack 1 378 31
on 1 378 31
him 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
orchestrated, 1 378 31
it 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
political 1 378 31
and 1 378 31
Ford 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
a 1 378 31
part 1 378 31
of 1 378 31
it. 1 378 31

It's 0 378 32
wrong. 0 378 32

Ford 0 378 33
didn't 0 378 33
even 0 378 33
think 0 378 33
to 0 378 33
act, 0 378 33
according 0 378 33
to 0 378 33
her 0 378 33
testimony, 0 378 33
until 0 378 33
Kavanaugh 0 378 33
was 0 378 33
on 0 378 33
the 0 378 33
short 0 378 33
list, 0 378 33
but 1 378 33
did 1 378 33
she 1 378 33
go 1 378 33
to 1 378 33
local 1 378 33
law 1 378 33
enforcement? 1 378 33

Nope. 0 378 34

She 0 378 35
went 0 378 35
to 0 378 35
her 0 378 35
US 0 378 35
Democrat 0 378 35
representative, 0 378 35
Senator 0 378 35
Dianne 0 378 35
Feinstein 0 378 35
and 0 378 35
The 0 378 35
Washington 0 378 35
Post. 0 378 35

If 0 378 36
that 0 378 36
is 0 378 36
not 0 378 36
political, 0 378 36
I 0 378 36
don't 0 378 36
know 0 378 36
what 0 378 36
is. 0 378 36

Ford 1 378 37
is 1 378 37
not 1 378 37
seeking 1 378 37
justice 1 378 37
nor 1 378 37
is 1 378 37
she 1 378 37
seeking 1 378 37
to 1 378 37
do 1 378 37
her 1 378 37
"civic 1 378 37
duty." 1 378 37

She 1 378 38
is 1 378 38
seeking 1 378 38
to 1 378 38
slander 1 378 38
a 1 378 38
man's 1 378 38
character 1 378 38
for 1 378 38
something 1 378 38
she 1 378 38
cannot 1 378 38
prove 1 378 38
that 1 378 38
she 1 378 38
claims 1 378 38
happened 1 378 38
over 1 378 38
36 1 378 38
years 1 378 38
ago. 1 378 38

Kavanaugh's 0 378 39

She 0 382 66
is 0 382 66
part 0 382 66
of 0 382 66
the 0 382 66
swamp, 0 382 66
part 0 382 66
of 0 382 66
the 0 382 66
willfully 1 382 66
ignorant 1 382 66
McMaster 0 382 66

that 0 382 66

failed 0 382 67
views 0 382 67
she 0 382 67
shared. 0 382 67

McMaster 0 382 68
subscribed 0 382 68
to 0 382 68
the 0 382 68

that 0 382 68

nothing 0 382 68
to 0 382 68
do 0 382 68
with 0 382 68
Islam, 0 382 68
despite 0 382 68
the 0 382 68
numerous 0 382 68
Islamic 0 382 68
texts 0 382 68
and 0 382 68
teachings 0 382 68
that 0 382 68
incite 0 382 68

war 0 382 68
against 0 382 68

McMaster 0 382 69
went 0 382 69
so 0 382 69
far 0 382 69
as 0 382 69
to 0 382 69
claim 0 382 69
that 0 382 69
devout 0 382 69

were 0 382 69
“irreligious.” 0 382 69

Again, 1 382 71
and 1 382 71
I 1 382 71
have 1 382 71
asked 1 382 71
this 1 382 71
before, 1 382 71
how 1 382 71
do 1 382 71
you 1 382 71
fight 1 382 71
the 1 382 71
Deep 1 382 71
State 1 382 71
by 1 382 71
putting 1 382 71
Deep 1 382 71
State 1 382 71
operatives 1 382 71
in 1 382 71
these 1 382 71
positions? 1 382 71

How 1 382 72
do 1 382 72
you 1 382 72
drain 1 382 72
the 1 382 72
swamp 1 382 72
by 1 382 72
adding 1 382 72
to 1 382 72
it? 1 382 72

The 0 382 73
answer 0 382 73
is 0 382 73
clear: 0 382 73
You 0 382 73
don't. 0 382 73

This 0 382 73

would 0 382 73

actually 0 382 73

be 0 382 73

the 0 382 73

perfect 0 382 73

time 0 382 73

for 0 382 73

stop 0 382 73

it 0 382 73

the 0 382 73

UN 0 382 73

from 0 382 73

are 0 384 33
the 0 384 33

themselves. 0 384 33

All 0 384 34
but 0 384 34
proving 0 384 34
the 0 384 34
case 0 384 34
that 0 384 34
this 0 384 34
was 0 384 34
a 0 384 34
coordinated 0 384 34
attack 0 384 34
by 0 384 34
the 0 384 34
tech 0 384 34

shortly 0 384 34
after 0 384 34
the 0 384 34
purge 0 384 34
on 0 384 34
Facebook, 0 384 34
Twitter 0 384 34
followed 0 384 34
suit, 0 384 34
wiping 0 384 34
out 0 384 34
our 0 384 34
profiles 0 384 34
on 0 384 34
there 0 384 34
as 0 384 34
well. 0 384 34

They 0 384 35
gave 0 384 35
absolutely 0 384 35
no 0 384 35
reason 0 384 35
for 0 384 35
the 0 384 35
suspension. 0 384 35

“This 0 384 36
signifies 0 384 36
a 0 384 36
re-consolidation 0 384 36
of 0 384 36
the 0 384 36
media. 0 384 36

Cable 0 384 37
news 0 384 37
media 0 384 37
controlled 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
narrative 0 384 37
for 0 384 37
most 0 384 37
of 0 384 37
modern 0 384 37
history, 0 384 37
but 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
internet 0 384 37
has 0 384 37
lowered 0 384 37
that 0 384 37
barrier 0 384 37
to 0 384 37
entry 0 384 37
and 0 384 37
allowed 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
average 0 384 37
person 0 384 37
to 0 384 37
become 0 384 37
the 0 384 37
media 0 384 37
themselves. 0 384 37

This 0 384 38
obviously 0 384 38
took 0 384 38
market 0 384 38
share 0 384 38
and 0 384 38
influence 0 384 38
away 0 384 38
from 0 384 38
the 0 384 38
traditional 0 384 38
media, 0 384 38
and 0 384 38
it 0 384 38
has 0 384 38
allowed 0 384 38
for 0 384 38
a 0 384 38
more 0 384 38
diverse 0 384 38
public 0 384 38
conversation. 0 384 38

Now 0 384 39
it 0 384 39
seems 0 384 39
the 0 384 39
platforms 0 384 39
that 0 384 39
have 0 384 39
monopolized 0 384 39
the 0 384 39
industry 0 384 39
are 0 384 39
favoring 0 384 39
mainstream 0 384 39
sources 0 384 39
and 0 384 39
silencing 0 384 39
alternative 0 384 39
voices. 0 384 39

So 0 384 40
now, 0 384 40
instead 0 384 40
of 0 384 40
allowing 0 384 40
more 0 384 40
people 0 384 40

a 0 384 40

where 0 384 40
only 0 384 40

are 0 384 40

just 0 384 40
as 0 384 40

poignantly 0 384 40
noted. 0 384 40

The 0 384 41
bottom 0 384 41

is 0 384 41
that 0 384 41

The 0 385 6

“direct 0 385 6

Pompeo 0 385 7
reminded 0 385 7
his 0 385 7
hosts 0 385 7
that 0 385 7
despite 0 385 7
the 0 385 7
numerous 0 385 7
bilateral 0 385 7
issues 0 385 7
the 0 385 7
two 0 385 7
governments 0 385 7
share, 0 385 7
determining 0 385 7
Khashoggi’s 0 385 7
fate 0 385 7
was 0 385 7
the 0 385 7
urgent 0 385 7
purpose 0 385 7
of 0 385 7
this 0 385 7
trip, 0 385 7
she 0 385 7
said. 0 385 7

Khashoggi, 0 385 8
a 0 385 8
prominent 0 385 8
critic 0 385 8
of 0 385 8
the 0 385 8
autocratic 0 385 8
Saudi 0 385 8
leadership, 0 385 8
was 0 385 8
last 0 385 8
seen 0 385 8
entering 0 385 8
the 0 385 8
Saudi 0 385 8
Consulate 0 385 8
in 0 385 8
Istanbul, 0 385 8
Turkey, 0 385 8
on 0 385 8
Oct. 0 385 8
2, 0 385 8
where 0 385 8
he 0 385 8
was 0 385 8
seeking 0 385 8
papers 0 385 8
to 0 385 8
marry 0 385 8

Turkish 0 385 9
media 0 385 9
reports, 0 385 9
based 0 385 9
in 0 385 9
part 0 385 9
on 0 385 9
apparent 0 385 9
audio 0 385 9
recordings, 0 385 9
have 0 385 9
said 0 385 9
Khashoggi 0 385 9
was 0 385 9
beaten 1 385 9
to 1 385 9
death 1 385 9
and 1 385 9
then 1 385 9
dismembered 1 385 9
in 0 385 9
the 0 385 9
building. 0 385 9

A 0 385 10
15-member 0 385 10
Saudi 0 385 10
military 0 385 10
team 0 385 10
had 0 385 10
entered 0 385 10
the 0 385 10
consulate 0 385 10
with 0 385 10
a 0 385 10
bone 0 385 10
saw 0 385 10
shortly 0 385 10
before 0 385 10
Khashoggi 0 385 10
arrived, 0 385 10
and 0 385 10
flew 0 385 10
out 0 385 10
of 0 385 10
the 0 385 10
country 0 385 10
soon 0 385 10
after, 0 385 10
the 0 385 10
reports 0 385 10
said. 0 385 10

Saudi 0 385 11
officials 0 385 11
insisted 0 385 11
that 0 385 11
Khashoggi 0 385 11
left 0 385 11
the 0 385 11
consulate 0 385 11
but 0 385 11
have 0 385 11
provided 0 385 11
no 0 385 11
video 0 385 11
or 0 385 11
other 0 385 11
evidence. 0 385 11

They 0 385 12
have 0 385 12
denied 0 385 12
any 0 385 12
responsibility 0 385 12
for 0 385 12
his 0 385 12
disappearance. 0 385 12

Hoping 0 385 13
to 0 385 13
stem 0 385 13
a 0 385 13
growing 0 385 13
furor, 0 385 13
Trump 0 385 13
on 0 385 13
Monday 0 385 13
suggested 0 385 13
“rogue 0 385 13
killers,” 0 385 13
not 0 385 13
the 0 385 13
Saudi 0 385 13
royal 0 385 13
family, 0 385 13
may 0 385 13
have 0 385 13
carried 0 385 13
out 0 385 13
the 0 385 13
murder. 0 385 13

Critics 0 385 14
quickly 0 385 14
said 0 385 14
that 0 385 14
Trump 0 385 14
was 0 385 14
providing 0 385 14
an 0 385 14
excuse 0 385 14
for 0 385 14
the 0 385 14
Saudi 0 385 14
leaders, 0 385 14
and 0 385 14
participating 0 385 14
in 0 385 14
a 0 385 14
cover-up. 0 385 14

That 0 385 15
seemed 0 385 15
to 0 385 15
set 0 385 15
the 0 385 15
stage 0 385 15
for 0 385 15
Saudi 0 385 15
officials 0 385 15
to 0 385 15
find 0 385 15
a 0 385 15
way 0 385 15
to 0 385 15
explain 0 385 15
away 0 385 15
the 0 385 15
alleged 0 385 15
shocking 1 385 15
death. 1 385 15

They 0 385 16
floated 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
idea 0 385 16
later 0 385 16
Monday 0 385 16
of 0 385 16
claiming 0 385 16
that 0 385 16
Khashoggi, 0 385 16
who 0 385 16
wrote 0 385 16
opinion 0 385 16
pieces 0 385 16
for 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
Washington 0 385 16
Post 0 385 16
and 0 385 16
Arab 0 385 16
media, 0 385 16
was 0 385 16
accidentally 0 385 16
killed 0 385 16
in 0 385 16
an 0 385 16
interrogation 0 385 16
gone 0 385 16
awry 0 385 16
inside 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
consulate 0 385 16
— 0 385 16
supposedly 0 385 16
without 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
approval 0 385 16
of 0 385 16
the 0 385 16
king 0 385 16
or 0 385 16
crown 0 385 16
prince. 0 385 16

Publicly, 0 385 17
Pompeo 0 385 17
and 0 385 17
his 0 385 17
hosts 0 385 17
looked 0 385 17
calm 0 385 17
and 0 385 17
friendly 0 385 17
when 0 385 17
they 0 385 17
met 0 385 17
Tuesday 0 385 17
in 0 385 17
Riyadh. 0 385 17

At 0 385 18
one 0 385 18
point, 0 385 18
as 0 385 18
they 0 385 18
greeted 0 385 18
each 0 385 18
other, 0 385 18
Prince 0 385 18
Mohammed 0 385 18
noted 0 385 18
the 0 385 18
two 0 385 18
countries 0 385 18
were 0 385 18
important 0 385 18
allies. 0 385 18

“Absolutely,” 0 385 19
Pompeo 0 385 19
said, 0 385 19
smiling. 0 385 19

The 0 385 20
United 0 385 20
States 0 385 20
long 0 385 20
guaranteed 0 385 20
Saudi 0 385 20
security 0 385 20
in 0 385 20
exchange 0 385 20
for 0 385 20
a 0 385 20
steady 0 385 20
supply 0 385 20
of 0 385 20
oil. 0 385 20

Those 0 385 21
ties 0 385 21
have 0 385 21
frayed 0 385 21
even 0 385 21
as 0 385 21
the 0 385 21
Trump 0 385 21
administration 0 385 21
has 0 385 21
embraced 0 385 21
the 0 385 21
Saudi 0 385 21
rulers 0 385 21
as 0 385 21
a 0 385 21
crucial 0 385 21
regional 0 385 21
ally 0 385 21
in 0 385 21
efforts 0 385 21
to 0 385 21
constrain 0 385 21
Iran 0 385 21
and 0 385 21
to 0 385 21
craft 0 385 21
a 0 385 21
peace 0 385 21
plan 0 385 21
between 0 385 21
Israel 0 385 21
and 0 385 21
the 0 385 21
Palestinians. 0 385 21

The 0 385 22
current 0 385 22
crisis 0 385 22
has 0 385 22
put 0 385 22
those 0 385 22
broader 0 385 22
goals 0 385 22
at 0 385 22
risk, 0 385 22
and 0 385 22
the 0 385 22
White 0 385 22
House 0 385 22
has 0 385 22
scrambled 0 385 22
to 0 385 22
find 0 385 22
a 0 385 22
face-saving 0 385 22
solution 0 385 22
for 0 385 22
the 0 385 22
Saudi 0 385 22
rulers. 0 385 22

Trump 0 385 23
has 0 385 23
said 0 385 23
he 0 385 23
would 0 385 23
impose 0 385 23
“severe” 1 385 23
punishment 0 385 23
if 0 385 23
proof 0 385 23
emerges 0 385 23
that 0 385 23
Saudi 0 385 23
rulers 0 385 23
sanctioned 0 385 23
Khashoggi’s 0 385 23
murder, 0 385 23
but 0 385 23
he 0 385 23
has 0 385 23
not 0 385 23
said 0 385 23
what 0 385 23
that 0 385 23
would 0 385 23
entail. 0 385 23

He 0 385 24
has 0 385 24
ruled 0 385 24
out 0 385 24
cancelling 0 385 24
or 0 385 24
suspending 0 385 24

deals 0 385 24
with 0 385 24
the 0 385 24
oil-rich 0 385 24
country. 0 385 24

Many 0 385 25
members 0 385 25
of 0 385 25
Congress 0 385 25
have 0 385 25
demanded 0 385 25
the 0 385 25
White 0 385 25
House 0 385 25
take 0 385 25
tougher 0 385 25
actions, 0 385 25
including 0 385 25
punitive 0 385 25
sanctions 0 385 25
on 0 385 25
Saudi 0 385 25
rulers. 0 385 25

But 0 385 26
Congress 0 385 26
has 0 385 26
taken 0 385 26
no 0 385 26
action 0 385 26
on 0 385 26
its 0 385 26

Pompeo 0 387 9

the 0 387 9
Saudis 0 387 9
“understand 0 387 9
the 0 387 9

nature” 0 387 9
of 0 387 9

“timely” 0 387 9

Their 0 387 10
findings, 0 387 10
Pompeo 0 387 10
said, 0 387 10
“will 0 387 10
be 0 387 10
transparent 0 387 10
for 0 387 10

to 0 387 10
its 0 387 10
thoroughness.” 0 387 10

He 0 387 11
said 0 387 11
he 0 387 11
told 0 387 11
the 0 387 11
president 0 387 11
“that 0 387 11
we 0 387 11
ought 0 387 11

so 0 387 11
that 0 387 11
we 0 387 11
too 0 387 11
have 0 387 11
a 0 387 11
complete 0 387 11
understanding 0 387 11
of 0 387 11
the 0 387 11
facts” 0 387 11
before 0 387 11
making 0 387 11
decisions 0 387 11
on 0 387 11
how 0 387 11
the 0 387 11
U.S. 0 387 11
should 0 387 11
respond. 0 387 11

Turkey 0 387 12
is 0 387 12
conducting 0 387 12
its 0 387 12
own 0 387 12
probe, 0 387 12
and 0 387 12
Pompeo 0 387 12
said 0 387 12
those 0 387 12
results 0 387 12
will 0 387 12
also 0 387 12
be 0 387 12
taken 0 387 12
into 0 387 12
consideration. 0 387 12

He 0 387 13
again 0 387 13
stressed 0 387 13
the 0 387 13
importance 0 387 13
of 0 387 13
Saudi 0 387 13
Arabia 0 387 13
as 0 387 13
a 0 387 13
strategic 0 387 13
ally, 0 387 13
in 0 387 13
a 0 387 13
relationship, 0 387 13
he 0 387 13
noted, 0 387 13
that 0 387 13
dates 0 387 13
back 0 387 13
more 0 387 13
than 0 387 13
80 0 387 13
years. 0 387 13

The 0 387 14
administration’s 0 387 14
reluctance 0 387 14
to 0 387 14
condemn 0 387 14
the 0 387 14
Saudi 0 387 14
government 0 387 14
has 0 387 14
fueled 0 387 14
criticism 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
Democrats 0 387 14
and 0 387 14
Republicans 0 387 14
in 0 387 14
Congress, 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
diplomats 0 387 14
and 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
even 0 387 14
some 0 387 14
corporations 0 387 14
that 0 387 14
long 0 387 14
have 0 387 14
profited 0 387 14
from 0 387 14
close 0 387 14
relations 0 387 14
with 0 387 14
the 0 387 14
Saudi 0 387 14
royal 0 387 14
family. 0 387 14

“We 0 387 15
just 0 387 15
are 0 387 15
going 0 387 15
to 0 387 15
allow 0 387 15

Pompeo 0 387 15
said. 0 387 15

“And 0 387 16

they 0 387 16

Barr 0 391 3
described 0 391 3
Mueller’s 0 391 3
submission 0 391 3
as 0 391 3
a 0 391 3
“confidential 0 391 3

what 0 391 5
the 0 391 5
report 0 391 5
contains, 0 391 5
but 0 391 5
did 0 391 5
say 0 391 5
that 0 391 5
the 0 391 5
Justice 0 391 5
Department 0 391 5
did 0 391 5
not 0 391 5

he 0 391 6

overseen 0 391 6
the 0 391 6
Special 0 391 6
Counsel’s 0 391 6

about 0 391 6
“what 0 391 6
other 0 391 6
information 0 391 6
from 0 391 6

House 0 391 7
and 0 391 7
President 0 391 7
Trump’s 0 391 7
lawyers 0 391 7
said 0 391 7
the 0 391 7
next 0 391 7
decisions 0 391 7
are 0 391 7
up 0 391 7
to 0 391 7
Barr. 0 391 7

There 0 391 8
is 0 391 8
a 0 391 8
possibility 0 391 8
that 0 391 8
Barr 0 391 8
releases 0 391 8
two 0 391 8
separate 0 391 8
reports. 0 391 8

One 0 391 9
would 0 391 9
summarize 0 391 9
Mueller’s 0 391 9
findings 0 391 9
without 0 391 9
including 0 391 9
classified 0 391 9
information 0 391 9
and 0 391 9
would 0 391 9
be 0 391 9
given 0 391 9
to 0 391 9
Congress—and 0 391 9
would 0 391 9
then 0 391 9
most 0 391 9
likely 0 391 9
find 0 391 9
its 0 391 9
way 0 391 9
out 0 391 9
into 0 391 9
the 0 391 9
public. 0 391 9

The 0 391 10
other 0 391 10
would 0 391 10
be 0 391 10

such 0 391 10

called 0 391 11
for 0 391 11
transparency. 0 391 11

“Mueller’s 0 391 12
investigation 0 391 12
began 0 391 12
as 0 391 12
a 0 391 12
counterintelligence 0 391 12
inquiry 0 391 12
into 0 391 12
whether 0 391 12
individuals 0 391 12

with 0 391 12
the 0 391 12
Trump 0 391 12

by 0 391 12
a 0 391 12
foreign 0 391 12
power. 0 391 12

By 0 391 13
law, 0 391 13
that 0 391 13

with 0 391 13

in 0 391 13
a 0 391 13
tweet. 0 391 13

“And 0 391 14
his 0 391 14

also 0 391 14
be 0 391 14
made 0 391 14
public. 0 391 14

Now.” 1 391 15

Trump 0 391 16
has 0 391 16
previously 0 391 16
said 0 391 16
he 0 391 16
supports 0 391 16
the 0 391 16
idea 0 391 16
of 0 391 16
making 0 391 16
the 0 391 16
report 0 391 16
public. 0 391 16

“I 0 391 17
don’t 0 391 17
mind,” 0 391 17
he 0 391 17
has 0 391 17
said. 0 391 17

“I 0 391 18
mean, 0 391 18
frankly, 0 391 18
I 0 391 18
told 0 391 18
the 0 391 18

‘If 0 391 18
you 0 391 18
want, 0 391 18
let 0 391 18
them 0 391 18
see 0 391 18
it.’” 0 391 18

Trump 0 391 19
has 0 391 19
also 0 391 19
vigorously 0 391 19
denied 0 391 19
any 0 391 19
wrongdoing 0 391 19
and 0 391 19
has 0 391 19
repeatedly 0 391 19
branded 0 391 19
the 0 391 19
probe 0 391 19
as 0 391 19
a 0 391 19
“total 1 391 19
witch 1 391 19
hunt.” 1 391 19

Mueller 0 391 20
will 0 391 20
remain 0 391 20
as 0 391 20
special 0 391 20
counsel 0 391 20
for 0 391 20
a 0 391 20
period 0 391 20
of 0 391 20
time 0 391 20
as 0 391 20
he 0 391 20
and 0 391 20
a 0 391 20
small 0 391 20
contingent 0 391 20
of 0 391 20
staff 0 391 20
close 0 391 20
the 0 391 20
office, 0 391 20
a 0 391 20
Justice 0 391 20
Department 0 391 20
spokesperson 0 391 20
reportedly 0 391 20
said. 0 391 20

The 0 391 21
handover 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
the 0 391 21
report 0 391 21
marks 0 391 21
the 0 391 21
end 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
an 0 391 21
investigation 0 391 21
that 0 391 21
has 0 391 21
for 0 391 21
nearly 0 391 21
two 0 391 21
years 0 391 21
transfixed 1 391 21
the 1 391 21
nation, 1 391 21
yielded 0 391 21
dozens 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
indictments 0 391 21
and 0 391 21
convictions, 0 391 21
and 0 391 21
brought 0 391 21
down 0 391 21
a 0 391 21
handful 0 391 21
of 0 391 21
Trump’s 0 391 21
closest 0 391 21
advisers. 0 391 21

The 0 391 22
Special 0 391 22
Counsel’s 0 391 22
Office 0 391 22
was 0 391 22
tasked 0 391 22
broadly 0 391 22
with 0 391 22
investigating 0 391 22
any 0 391 22
links 0 391 22
or 0 391 22
coordination 0 391 22
between 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
Russian 0 391 22
government 0 391 22
and 0 391 22
individuals 0 391 22
associated 0 391 22
with 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
Trump 0 391 22
campaign, 0 391 22
as 0 391 22
well 0 391 22
as 0 391 22
any 0 391 22
matters 0 391 22
that 0 391 22
arose 0 391 22
directly 0 391 22
from 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
probe. 0 391 22

However, 0 391 23
the 0 391 23
scope 0 391 23
of 0 391 23
the 0 391 23
investigation 0 391 23
seems 0 391 23
to 1 391 23
have 1 391 23
bled 1 391 23
outside 1 391 23
those 1 391 23
lines. 1 391 23

Several 0 391 24
witnesses, 0 391 24
for 0 391 24
example, 0 391 24
have 0 391 24
been 0 391 24
questioned 0 391 24
about 0 391 24
other 0 391 24
countries’ 0 391 24
efforts 0 391 24
to 0 391 24
meddle 0 391 24
in 0 391 24
American 1 391 24
politics, 0 391 24
including 0 391 24
Saudi 0 391 24
Arabia, 0 391 24
Israel, 0 391 24
the 0 391 24
UAE 0 391 24
and 0 391 24
Qatar. 0 391 24

So 0 391 25
far, 0 391 25
the 0 391 25
Special 0 391 25
Counsel’s 0 391 25
Office 0 391 25
has 0 391 25
indicted 0 391 25
or 0 391 25
obtained 0 391 25
guilty 0 391 25
pleas 0 391 25
from 0 391 25
34 0 391 25
people 0 391 25
and 0 391 25
three 0 391 25
companies. 0 391 25

Six 0 391 26
of 0 391 26
those 0 391 26
are 0 391 26
former 0 391 26
Trump 0 391 26
associates, 0 391 26
and 0 391 26
25 0 391 26
of 0 391 26
them 0 391 26
are 0 391 26
Russians. 0 391 26

No 0 391 27
Americans 0 391 27
have 0 391 27
been 0 391 27
charged 0 391 27
with 0 391 27
conspiring 0 391 27
with 0 391 27
Russians 0 391 27
to 0 391 27
meddle 0 391 27
in 0 391 27
the 0 391 27
2016 0 391 27
elections—at 0 391 27
least 0 391 27
none 0 391 27
the 0 391 27
public 0 391 27
knows 0 391 27
about. 0 391 27

But 0 391 28
major 0 391 28
Trumpworld 1 391 28
figures 1 391 28
were 0 391 28
charged 0 391 28
with 0 391 28
a 0 391 28
variety 0 391 28
of 0 391 28
other 0 391 28
crimes, 0 391 28
including 0 391 28
former 0 391 28
National 0 391 28

to 0 391 29
three 0 391 29
years 0 391 29

over 0 393 16
the 0 393 16

of 0 393 16

As 0 393 17
The 0 393 17
New 0 393 17
York 0 393 17
Times 0 393 17
reported 0 393 17

of 1 393 17

Still, 0 393 18
even 0 393 18
after 0 393 18
the 0 393 18
Mueller 0 393 18

it 0 393 18
is 0 393 18
very 0 393 18
much 0 393 18
the 0 393 18
beginning, 0 393 18
not 0 393 18

Friday, 0 393 19
The 0 393 19

President 0 393 20
Trump 0 393 20
himself 0 393 20
appears 0 393 20
to 0 393 20

even 0 393 21
after 0 393 21
the 0 393 21

Trump 0 393 22
broached 0 393 22
the 0 393 22

multiple 0 393 22

late 0 393 22

if 0 393 23
the 0 393 23

a 0 61 2

now 0 63 2
warning 0 63 2
the 1 63 2

bacteria 1 63 2
could 1 63 2
mutate 1 63 2

as 0 63 2
it 0 63 2

Coupled 0 63 3
with 0 63 3
the 0 63 3

that 0 63 3

Professor 0 63 4
Paul 0 63 4
Hunter 0 63 4
has 0 63 4
warned 0 63 4
that, 0 63 4
while 0 63 4
it 0 63 4
would 0 63 4
be 0 63 4
rather 0 63 4
easy 0 63 4
for 0 63 4
an 0 63 4
advanced 0 63 4
country 0 63 4
to 0 63 4
contain 0 63 4
the 0 63 4
disease 0 63 4
in 0 63 4
its 0 63 4
current 0 63 4
form, 0 63 4
he 1 63 4
fears 1 63 4
that 1 63 4
it 1 63 4
could 1 63 4
evolve 1 63 4
into 1 63 4
something 1 63 4
far 1 63 4
more 1 63 4
dangerous. 1 63 4

Hunter, 0 63 5
who 0 63 5
is 0 63 5
a 0 63 5
disease 0 63 5
expert 0 63 5
at 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
University 0 63 5
of 0 63 5
East 0 63 5
Anglia, 0 63 5
told 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
Daily 0 63 5
Star: 0 63 5
“If 0 63 5
it 0 63 5
reaches 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
UK, 0 63 5
Europe 0 63 5
or 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
US 0 63 5
it 0 63 5
would 0 63 5
be 0 63 5
similar 0 63 5
to 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
Ebola 0 63 5
outbreak. 0 63 5

We 0 63 6
would 0 63 6
have 0 63 6
a 0 63 6
few 0 63 6
isolated 0 63 6
cases 0 63 6
but 0 63 6
it 0 63 6
shouldn’t 0 63 6
spread 0 63 6
like 0 63 6
it 0 63 6
has 0 63 6
in 0 63 6
Madagascar.” 0 63 6
But 0 63 6
he 0 63 6
had 0 63 6
more 0 63 6
to 0 63 6
add. 0 63 6

“As 0 63 7
with 0 63 7
any 0 63 7
disease, 0 63 7
it’s 1 63 7
a 1 63 7
real 1 63 7
worry 1 63 7
that 1 63 7
it 1 63 7
mutates 1 63 7
and 1 63 7
become 1 63 7
untreatable,” 1 63 7
Hunter 0 63 7
said. 0 63 7

So 0 63 8
far, 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
majority 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
recent 0 63 8
cases 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
black 0 63 8
death 0 63 8
have 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
been 0 63 8
pneumonic 0 63 8
plague, 0 63 8
a 0 63 8
more 0 63 8
deadly 0 63 8
form 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
bubonic 0 63 8
plague 0 63 8
which 0 63 8
devastated 1 63 8
Europe’s 0 63 8
population 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
1300s. 0 63 8

While 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
bubonic 0 63 9
plague 0 63 9
is 0 63 9
spread 0 63 9
through 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
bites 0 63 9
of 0 63 9
infected 0 63 9
fleas, 0 63 9
pneumonic 0 63 9
plague 0 63 9
is 0 63 9
spread 0 63 9
through 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
air, 0 63 9
usually 0 63 9
by 0 63 9
coughing. 0 63 9

Airborne 0 63 10
infections 0 63 10
are 0 63 10
difficult 1 63 10
at 1 63 10
best 1 63 10
to 0 63 10
control. 0 63 10

Symptoms 0 63 11
of 0 63 11
the 0 63 11
plague 0 63 11
include 0 63 11

an 0 155 6

As 0 155 7
part 0 155 7
of 0 155 7
her 0 155 7
final 0 155 7
class, 0 155 7
for 0 155 7
which 0 155 7
she 0 155 7
paid 0 155 7
almost 0 155 7
$1,000, 0 155 7
students 0 155 7
were 0 155 7
required 0 155 7
to 0 155 7
complete 0 155 7
a 0 155 7
project 0 155 7
outline 0 155 7
last 0 155 7
month 0 155 7
in 0 155 7
which 0 155 7
they 0 155 7
would 0 155 7
compare 0 155 7
a 0 155 7
social 0 155 7
norm 0 155 7
in 0 155 7
the 0 155 7
US 0 155 7
and 0 155 7
another 0 155 7
country. 0 155 7

For 0 155 8
her 0 155 8
"norm" 0 155 8
Arnold 0 155 8
picked 0 155 8
social 0 155 8
media 0 155 8
use, 0 155 8
and 0 155 8
for 0 155 8
her 0 155 8
country 0 155 8
she 0 155 8
chose 0 155 8
Australia. 0 155 8

But 0 155 9
when 0 155 9
Arnold 0 155 9
got 0 155 9
her 0 155 9
grade 0 155 9
back 0 155 9
on 0 155 9
Feb. 0 155 9
1, 0 155 9
she 0 155 9
was 0 155 9
shocked 1 155 9
to 0 155 9
see 0 155 9
her 0 155 9
professor 0 155 9
had 0 155 9
failed 0 155 9
her. 0 155 9

Why? 0 155 10

Because, 0 155 11
according 0 155 11
to 0 155 11
the 0 155 11
teacher, 0 155 11
"Australia 0 155 11
is 0 155 11
a 0 155 11
continent; 0 155 11
not 0 155 11
a 0 155 11
country." 0 155 11

Sociology. 1 155 12

You 1 155 13
really 1 155 13
don't 1 155 13
need 1 155 13
to 1 155 13
know 1 155 13
anything. 1 155 13

The 1 155 14
professor, 1 155 14
who 1 155 14
has 1 155 14
a 1 155 14
PhD 1 155 14
in 1 155 14
philosophy... 1 155 14

Of 1 155 15
course 1 155 15
she 1 155 15
does. 1 155 15

I 0 155 16
believe 0 155 16
I 0 155 16
got 0 155 16
zero 0 155 16
or 0 155 16
partial 0 155 16
credit 0 155 16
because 0 155 16
the 0 155 16
instructor 0 155 16
said, 0 155 16
'Australia 0 155 16
is 0 155 16
a 0 155 16
continent; 0 155 16
not 0 155 16
a 0 155 16
country. 0 155 16

However, 0 155 17
I 0 155 17
believe 0 155 17
that 0 155 17
Australia 0 155 17
is 0 155 17
a 0 155 17
country. 0 155 17

The 0 155 18
research 0 155 18
starter 0 155 18
on 0 155 18
the 0 155 18
SNHU’s 0 155 18
Shapiro 0 155 18

written 0 155 18
by 0 155 18
John 0 155 18
Pearson 0 155 18
(2013) 0 155 18
states, 0 155 18
that 0 155 18
Australia 0 155 18
is 0 155 18
the 0 155 18
'sixth-largest 0 155 18
country 0 155 18
in 0 155 18
the 0 155 18
world' 0 155 18
(n.p.). 0 155 18

The 0 155 19
full 0 155 19
name 0 155 19
of 0 155 19
the 0 155 19
country 0 155 19
is 0 155 19
the 0 155 19
Commonwealth 0 155 19
of 0 155 19
Australia, 0 155 19
meaning 0 155 19
Australia 0 155 19
is 0 155 19
both 0 155 19
a 0 155 19
continent 0 155 19
and 0 155 19
a 0 155 19
country. 0 155 19

Therefore, 0 155 20
these 0 155 20
sections 0 155 20
of 0 155 20
the 0 155 20
rubric 0 155 20
should 0 155 20
be 0 155 20
amended. 0 155 20

Australia's 0 155 21
nationhood 0 155 21
is 0 155 21
not 0 155 21
a 0 155 21
matter 0 155 21
of 0 155 21
belief. 0 155 21

But 0 155 22
we 0 155 22
are 0 155 22
in 0 155 22
the 1 155 22
age 1 155 22
of, 1 155 22
"My 1 155 22
truth". 1 155 22

And 0 155 23
my 1 155 23
truth 1 155 23
has 0 155 23
a 0 155 23
different 0 155 23
belief 0 155 23
about 0 155 23
Australia 0 155 23
than 0 155 23
yours 0 155 23
does 0 155 23
because 0 155 23
of 0 155 23
my 0 155 23
degree 0 155 23
of 0 155 23
oppression. 0 155 23

Finally, 0 155 24

the 0 155 25
professor 0 155 25
responded: 0 155 25
Thank 0 155 25
you 0 155 25

After 0 155 26
I 0 155 26

There's 0 189 7
also 0 189 7
a 0 189 7
quote 0 189 7
from 0 189 7
an 0 189 7
Obama 0 189 7
spokeswoman 0 189 7
claiming 0 189 7
that, 0 189 7
“President 0 189 7
Obama 0 189 7
has 0 189 7
denounced 0 189 7
racism 0 189 7
and 0 189 7
anti-Semitism 0 189 7
his 0 189 7
entire 0 189 7
life. 0 189 7

That 0 189 8
includes 0 189 8
his 0 189 8
public 0 189 8
and 0 189 8
repeated 0 189 8
repudiations 0 189 8
of 0 189 8
Louis 0 189 8
Farrakhan’s 0 189 8
views 0 189 8
over 0 189 8
the 0 189 8
years. 0 189 8

Today 0 189 9
is 0 189 9
no 0 189 9
different 0 189 9
– 0 189 9
he 0 189 9
still 0 189 9
rejects 0 189 9
the 1 189 9
harmful 1 189 9
and 1 189 9
divisive 1 189 9
views 1 189 9
Farrakhan 0 189 9
continues 0 189 9
to 0 189 9
espouse.” 0 189 9

That 0 189 10
fails 1 189 10
to 1 189 10
explain 1 189 10
why 1 189 10
he 1 189 10
met 1 189 10
with 1 189 10
him. 1 189 10

And 0 189 11
maybe 0 189 11
one 0 189 11
of 0 189 11
these 0 189 11
days 0 189 11
someone 0 189 11
will 0 189 11
ask 0 189 11
him 0 189 11
that 0 189 11
question. 0 189 11

And 0 189 12
then 0 189 12
Obama 0 189 12
can 0 189 12
give 0 189 12
a 0 189 12
new 0 189 12
remix 0 189 12
of 0 189 12
his 0 189 12
Wright 0 189 12
speech. 0 189 12

"I 0 189 13
can 0 189 13
no 0 189 13
more 0 189 13
disavow 0 189 13
Calypso 0 189 13

Rep. 0 189 14
Danny 0 189 14
Davis, 0 189 14
after 0 189 14
defending 0 189 14
Farrakhan, 0 189 14
now 0 189 14
has 0 189 14
a 0 189 14
statement 0 189 14
condemning 0 189 14
him. 0 189 14

But 1 189 15
we've 1 189 15
seen 1 189 15
that 1 189 15
before. 1 189 15

So 1 189 16
it 1 189 16
likely 1 189 16
doesn't 1 189 16
represent 1 189 16
his 1 189 16
views. 1 189 16

After 0 189 17
a 0 189 17
previous 0 189 17
statement, 0 189 17
Rep. 0 189 17
Davis 0 189 17
made 0 189 17
an 0 189 17
infamous 0 189 17
comment 0 189 17
about 0 189 17
the 0 189 17
"Jewish 0 189 17
question". 0 189 17

So 0 189 18
it 0 189 18
probably 0 189 18
still 0 189 18
isn't 0 189 18
over. 0 189 18

The 1 189 19
statement 1 189 19
though 1 189 19
is 1 189 19
full 1 189 19
of 1 189 19
conspiracy 1 189 19
theories 1 189 19
and 1 189 19
blames 1 189 19
everyone 1 189 19
else 1 189 19
for 1 189 19
Davis' 1 189 19
behavior 1 189 19
except 1 189 19
him. 1 189 19

And 0 189 20
now 0 189 20

in 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
2008 0 216 1
presidential 0 216 1
race, 0 216 1
I 0 216 1
explained 0 216 1
to 0 216 1
then-candidate 0 216 1
Rudy 0 216 1
Giuliani 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
concept 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
“blowback.” 0 216 1
Years 0 216 1
of 0 216 1
US 0 216 1

and 0 216 1

attacks 0 216 1
against 0 216 1
the 0 216 1
United 0 216 1
States 0 216 1
on 0 216 1
9/11. 0 216 1

They 0 216 2
didn’t 0 216 2
do 0 216 2
it 0 216 2
because 0 216 2
we 0 216 2
are 0 216 2
so 0 216 2
rich 0 216 2
and 0 216 2
so 0 216 2
free, 0 216 2
as 0 216 2
the 0 216 2
neocons 0 216 2
would 0 216 2
have 0 216 2
us 0 216 2
believe. 0 216 2

They 0 216 3
came 0 216 3
over 0 216 3
here 0 216 3
because 0 216 3
we 0 216 3
had 0 216 3
been 0 216 3
killing 0 216 3
Muslims 0 216 3
“over 0 216 3
there” 0 216 3
for 0 216 3
decades. 0 216 3

How 0 216 4
do 0 216 4
we 0 216 4
know 0 216 4
this? 0 216 4

Well, 0 216 5
they 0 216 5
told 0 216 5
us. 0 216 5

Osama 0 216 6
bin 0 216 6
Laden 0 216 6
made 0 216 6
it 0 216 6
clear 0 216 6
why 0 216 6
al-Qaeda 0 216 6
sought 0 216 6
to 0 216 6
attack 0 216 6
the 0 216 6
US. 0 216 6

They 0 216 7
didn’t 0 216 7
like 0 216 7
the 0 216 7
US 0 216 7
taking 0 216 7
sides 0 216 7
in 0 216 7
the 0 216 7

they 0 216 7
didn’t 0 216 7

a 0 216 8
terrorist, 0 216 8
some 0 216 8
responded. 0 216 8

Unfortunately, 0 216 20
it 0 216 20
is 0 216 20
clear 0 216 20
that 0 216 20
Giuliani 0 216 20
never 0 216 20
really 0 216 20
understood 0 216 20
what 0 216 20
I 0 216 20
was 0 216 20
trying 0 216 20
to 0 216 20
tell 0 216 20
him. 0 216 20

Like 0 216 21
the 0 216 21
rest 0 216 21
of 0 216 21
the 0 216 21
neocons, 0 216 21
he 0 216 21
either 0 216 21
doesn’t 0 216 21
get 0 216 21
it 0 216 21
or 0 216 21
doesn’t 0 216 21
want 0 216 21
to 0 216 21
get 0 216 21
it. 0 216 21

In 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
recent 0 216 22
speech 0 216 22
to 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
MeK 0 216 22
– 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
violent 1 216 22
Islamist-Marxist 0 216 22
cult 0 216 22
that 0 216 22
spent 0 216 22
two 0 216 22
decades 0 216 22
on 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
US 0 216 22
terror 0 216 22
watch 0 216 22
list 0 216 22
– 0 216 22
Giuliani 0 216 22
promised 0 216 22
that 0 216 22
the 0 216 22
Trump 0 216 22
Administration 0 216 22
had 0 216 22
made 0 216 22
“regime 0 216 22
change” 0 216 22
a 0 216 22
priority 0 216 22
for 0 216 22
Iran. 0 216 22

He 0 216 23
even 0 216 23
told 0 216 23
the 0 216 23
members 0 216 23
of 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
organization 0 216 23
– 0 216 23
an 0 216 23
organization 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
has 0 216 23
killed 1 216 23
dozens 1 216 23
of 1 216 23
Americans 1 216 23
– 0 216 23
that 0 216 23
Trump 0 216 23
would 0 216 23
put 0 216 23
them 0 216 23
in 0 216 23
charge 0 216 23
of 0 216 23
Iran! 0 216 23

Giuliani 0 216 24
shares 0 216 24
with 0 216 24
numerous 0 216 24
other 0 216 24
neocons 0 216 24
like 0 216 24
John 0 216 24
Bolton 0 216 24
a 0 216 24
strong 0 216 24
relationship 0 216 24
with 0 216 24
this 0 216 24
group. 0 216 24

In 0 216 25
fact, 0 216 25
both 0 216 25
Giuliani 0 216 25
and 0 216 25
Bolton 0 216 25
have 0 216 25
been 0 216 25
on 0 216 25
the 0 216 25
payroll 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
the 0 216 25
MeK 0 216 25
and 0 216 25
have 0 216 25
received 0 216 25
tens 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
thousands 0 216 25
of 0 216 25
dollars 0 216 25
to 0 216 25
speak 0 216 25
to 0 216 25
their 0 216 25
followers. 0 216 25

This 0 216 26
is 0 216 26
another 0 216 26
example 0 216 26
of 0 216 26
how 0 216 26
foreign 0 216 26
lobbies 0 216 26
and 0 216 26
special 0 216 26
interest 0 216 26
groups 0 216 26
maintain 0 216 26
an 0 216 26
iron 0 216 26
grip 0 216 26
on 0 216 26
our 0 216 26
foreign 0 216 26
policy. 0 216 26

Does 1 216 27
anyone 1 216 27
really 1 216 27
think 1 216 27
Iran 1 216 27
will 1 216 27
be 1 216 27
better 1 216 27
off 1 216 27
if 1 216 27
Trump 1 216 27
puts 1 216 27
a 1 216 27
bunch 1 216 27
of 1 216 27
“former” 1 216 27
terrorists 1 216 27
in 1 216 27
charge 1 216 27
of 1 216 27
the 1 216 27
country? 1 216 27

How 1 216 28
did 1 216 28
that 1 216 28
work 1 216 28
in 1 216 28
Libya? 1 216 28

It’s 0 216 29
easy 0 216 29
to 0 216 29
dismiss 0 216 29
the 0 216 29
bombastic 0 216 29
Giuliani 0 216 29
as 0 216 29
he 0 216 29
speaks 0 216 29
to 0 216 29
his 0 216 29
financial 0 216 29
benefactors 0 216 29
in 0 216 29
the 0 216 29
MeK. 0 216 29

Unfortunately, 0 216 30
however, 0 216 30
Giuliani’s 0 216 30
claims 0 216 30
were 0 216 30
confirmed 0 216 30
late 0 216 30
last 0 216 30
week, 0 216 30
when 0 216 30
the 0 216 30
Washington 0 216 30
Free 0 216 30
Beacon 0 216 30
published 0 216 30
a 0 216 30
three-page 0 216 30
policy 0 216 30
paper 0 216 30
being 0 216 30
circulated 0 216 30
among 0 216 30
National 0 216 30
Security 0 216 30
Council 0 216 30
officials 0 216 30
containing 0 216 30
plans 0 216 30
to 0 216 30
spark 0 216 30
regime 0 216 30
change 0 216 30
in 0 216 30
Iran. 0 216 30

The 0 216 31
paper 0 216 31
suggests 0 216 31
that 0 216 31
the 0 216 31
US 0 216 31
focus 0 216 31
on 0 216 31
Iran’s 0 216 31
many 0 216 31
ethnic 0 216 31
minority 0 216 31
groups 0 216 31
to 0 216 31
spark 0 216 31
unrest 0 216 31
and 0 216 31
an 0 216 31
eventual 0 216 31
overthrow 0 216 31
of 0 216 31
the 0 216 31
government. 0 216 31

This 0 216 32
is 0 216 32
virtually 0 216 32
the 0 216 32
same 0 216 32
road 0 216 32
map 0 216 32
that 0 216 32
the 0 216 32
US 0 216 32
has 0 216 32
followed 0 216 32
in 0 216 32
Iraq, 0 216 32
Libya, 0 216 32
Syria, 0 216 32
and 0 216 32
so 0 216 32
on. 0 216 32

The 0 216 33
results 0 216 33
have 0 216 33
been 0 216 33
unmitigated 0 216 33
disaster 1 216 33
after 1 216 33
disaster. 1 216 33

Unleashing 0 216 34
terrorists 0 216 34
on 0 216 34
Iran 0 216 34
to 0 216 34
overthrow 0 216 34
its 0 216 34
government 0 216 34
is 0 216 34
not 0 216 34
only 0 216 34
illegal 0 216 34
and 0 216 34
immoral: 0 216 34
it’s 0 216 34
also 0 216 34
incredibly 1 216 34
stupid. 1 216 34

We 0 216 35
know 0 216 35
from 0 216 35
9/11 0 216 35
that 0 216 35
blowback 0 216 35
is 0 216 35
real, 0 216 35
even 0 216 35
if 0 216 35
Giuliani 0 216 35
and 0 216 35
the 0 216 35
neocons 0 216 35
refuse 0 216 35
to 0 216 35
understand 0 216 35
it. 0 216 35

Iran 0 216 36
does 0 216 36
not 0 216 36
threaten 0 216 36
the 0 216 36
United 0 216 36
States. 0 216 36

Unlike 0 216 37
Washington’s 0 216 37
Arab 0 216 37
allies 0 216 37
in 0 216 37
the 0 216 37
region, 0 216 37
Iran 0 216 37
actually 0 216 37
holds 0 216 37
reasonably 0 216 37
democratic 0 216 37
elections 0 216 37
and 0 216 37
has 0 216 37
a 0 216 37

The 0 255 2

getting 0 255 2

The 0 255 4

“When 0 255 5

rampant 1 255 7

That’s 0 255 8
just 0 255 8

said 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
top 0 255 13
three 0 255 13
reasons 0 255 13
that 0 255 13
parents 0 255 13
choose 0 255 13

are 0 255 13
a 0 255 13
desire 0 255 13
to 0 255 13
provide 0 255 13
religious 0 255 13
instruction 0 255 13
or 0 255 13
different 0 255 13

those 0 255 13
offered 0 255 13

dissatisfaction 0 255 13
with 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
academic 0 255 13
curriculum, 0 255 13
and 0 255 13
worries 0 255 13
about 0 255 13
the 0 255 13
school 0 255 13
environment. 0 255 13

Since 0 255 14
teachers 0 255 14
are 0 255 14
not 0 255 14
allowed 0 255 14
to 0 255 14

violence 1 255 14
often 0 255 14
perpetrated 0 255 14
at 0 255 14
schools 0 255 14
simply 0 255 14
because 0 255 14
they 0 255 14
are 0 255 14
gun 0 255 14
free 0 255 14
zones, 0 255 14
homeschooling 0 255 14
takes 0 255 14
care 0 255 14
of 0 255 14
that 0 255 14
problem. 0 255 14

“Most 0 255 15
parents 0 255 15
homeschool 0 255 15
for 0 255 15
more 0 255 15
than 0 255 15
one 0 255 15
reason,” 0 255 15
Ray 0 255 15
told 0 255 15
the 0 255 15
paper. 0 255 15

“But 0 255 16
when 0 255 16
we 0 255 16
ask 0 255 16
families 0 255 16
why 0 255 16
do 0 255 16
they 0 255 16
homeschool, 0 255 16
near 0 255 16
the 0 255 16
top 0 255 16

of 0 255 17
that.” 0 255 17

Indoctrination 1 255 18
means 0 255 18
to 0 255 18
teach 0 255 18

person 0 255 18
to 0 255 18
accept 0 255 18
a 0 255 18

uncritically. 0 255 18

It’s 1 255 19
the 1 255 19
very 1 255 19
reason 1 255 19
the 1 255 19
governments 1 255 19

cannot 0 255 20
logically 0 255 20

critically 0 255 20
understand 0 255 20
that 0 255 20
hurting 0 255 20
people 0 255 20
and 0 255 20
taking 0 255 20
their 0 255 20
things 0 255 20
is 0 255 20
wrong 0 255 20
– 0 255 20
even 0 255 20
if 0 255 20
people 0 255 20
who 0 255 20
declare 0 255 20
themselves 0 255 20
government 0 255 20
is 0 255 20
the 0 255 20
one 0 255 20
doing 0 255 20
it. 0 255 20

Governments 1 255 21
are 1 255 21
nothing 1 255 21
more 1 255 21
than 1 255 21
a 1 255 21
handful 1 255 21
of 1 255 21
people 1 255 21
and 0 255 21
have 0 255 21

right 0 255 21
to 0 255 21
aggress 0 255 21
against 0 255 21

But 0 255 22
humans 0 255 22

billed 0 274 5
as 0 274 5
a 0 274 5
second-coming 0 274 5
extravaganza 0 274 5
between 0 274 5
the 0 274 5
two 0 274 5
leaders 0 274 5
– 0 274 5
who 0 274 5
have 0 274 5
been 0 274 5
trading 0 274 5
insults 0 274 5
of 0 274 5
‘little 1 274 5
rocket 1 274 5
man’ 1 274 5
and 0 274 5
‘dotard’ 1 274 5
(someone 0 274 5
who 0 274 5
is 0 274 5
senile) 0 274 5
turned 0 274 5
out 0 274 5
to 0 274 5
be 0 274 5
a 0 274 5
very 1 274 5
expensive 1 274 5
photo 0 274 5
op 0 274 5
for 0 274 5
both 0 274 5
publicity 0 274 5
seekers 0 274 5
that 0 274 5
made 0 274 5
much 0 274 5
noise 0 274 5
but 0 274 5
produced 0 274 5
very 0 274 5
little 0 274 5
– 0 274 5
at 0 274 5
least 0 274 5
so 0 274 5
far. 0 274 5

It 0 274 6
seemed 0 274 6
as 0 274 6
if 0 274 6
two 0 274 6
schoolyard 1 274 6
bullies 1 274 6
had 0 274 6
been 0 274 6
forced 0 274 6

the 0 274 6
principal 0 274 6
to 0 274 6
shake 0 274 6
hands. 0 274 6

Beyond 0 274 7
gestures, 0 274 7
North 0 274 7
Korea’s 0 274 7
leader 0 274 7
certainly 0 274 7
came 0 274 7
out 0 274 7
ahead. 0 274 7

Trump’s 0 274 9
objectives, 0 274 9
at 0 274 9
least 0 274 9
initially, 0 274 9
were 0 274 9
to 1 274 9

Japan 0 274 9
and 0 274 9
South 0 274 9
Korea. 0 274 9

Trump 0 274 10
sought 0 274 10
to 0 274 10
set 0 274 10
up 0 274 10
Kim 0 274 10
as 0 274 10
a 0 274 10
bogeyman, 1 274 10
and 0 274 10
himself 0 274 10
as 0 274 10
America’s 1 274 10
savior. 1 274 10

Trump 0 274 11
knew 0 274 11
perfectly 1 274 11
well 1 274 11
that 0 274 11
he 0 274 11
could 0 274 11
not 0 274 11
destroy 0 274 11
all 0 274 11
of 0 274 11
North 0 274 11
Korea’s 0 274 11
deeply 0 274 11
buried 0 274 11
nuclear-armed 0 274 11
missiles, 0 274 11
and, 0 274 11
in 0 274 11
spite 0 274 11
of 0 274 11
his 0 274 11
huffing 0 274 11
and 0 274 11
puffing, 0 274 11
had 1 274 11
no 1 274 11
stomach 1 274 11
for 1 274 11
an 1 274 11
invasion 1 274 11
of 0 274 11
North 0 274 11
Korea 0 274 11
that 0 274 11
could 0 274 11
cost 0 274 11
the 0 274 11
US 0 274 11
an 0 274 11
estimated 0 274 11
250,000 0 274 11
casualties. 0 274 11

So 0 274 12
Trump’s 0 274 12
solution 0 274 12
was 0 274 12
more 0 274 12
show-biz. 1 274 12

A 0 274 13
much 1 274 13
ballyhooed 1 274 13
flight 0 274 13
to 0 274 13
Singapore, 0 274 13
backslapping 0 274 13
a 0 274 13
delighted 1 274 13
Kim, 0 274 13
and 0 274 13
a 0 274 13
love-fest 1 274 13
between 0 274 13
the 0 274 13
two 0 274 13
chunky 1 274 13
leaders 0 274 13
was 1 274 13
sold 1 274 13
to 1 274 13
Americans 0 274 13
as 0 274 13
the 0 274 13
dawn 0 274 13
of 0 274 13
peace. 0 274 13

America’s 0 274 14
media 0 274 14
was 0 274 14
quick 0 274 14
to 0 274 14
retail 0 274 14
the 0 274 14
story 0 274 14
and 0 274 14
burnish 1 274 14
Trump’s 0 274 14
credentials 0 274 14
among 0 274 14
the 0 274 14
seriously 0 274 14
credulous. 0 274 14

No 0 274 15
more 0 274 15
hiding 0 274 15
under 0 274 15
your 0 274 15
school 0 274 15
desks 0 274 15
or 0 274 15
in 0 274 15
dank 0 274 15
basements. 0 274 15

As 0 274 16
Trump 0 274 16
grandly 1 274 16
proclaimed, 0 274 16
Americans 1 274 16
no 1 274 16
longer 1 274 16
have 1 274 16
to 1 274 16
fear 1 274 16
North 1 274 16
Korea 1 274 16
and 0 274 16
can 1 274 16
sleep 1 274 16
peacefully 1 274 16
at 1 274 16
night! 1 274 16

Why? 1 274 17

Korea 0 274 18
still 0 274 18
has 0 274 18
all 0 274 18
of 0 274 18
its 0 274 18
medium 0 274 18
and 0 274 18
long-ranged 0 274 18
missiles 0 274 18
and 0 274 18
an 0 274 18
estimated 0 274 18
40 0 274 18
or 0 274 18
more 0 274 18
nuclear 0 274 18
warheads. 0 274 18

The 0 274 19
North 0 274 19
is 0 274 19
developing 0 274 19
submarines 0 274 19
that 0 274 19
can 0 274 19
launch 0 274 19
nuclear-armed 0 274 19
missiles 0 274 19
from 0 274 19
underwater 0 274 19
off 0 274 19
America’s 0 274 19
coasts. 0 274 19

For 0 274 20
Kim, 0 274 20
these 0 274 20
weapons 0 274 20
are 0 274 20
purely 0 274 20
defensive, 0 274 20
designed 0 274 20
to 0 274 20
prevent 0 274 20
a 0 274 20
US 0 274 20
attack 0 274 20
on 0 274 20
his 0 274 20
nation. 0 274 20

But 0 274 21
he 0 274 21
is 0 274 21
now 0 274 21
a 0 274 21
full-fledged 0 274 21
member 0 274 21
of 0 274 21
the 0 274 21
nuclear 0 274 21
club. 0 274 21

Equally 0 274 22
important, 0 274 22
North 0 274 22
Korea 0 274 22
still 0 274 22
has 0 274 22
an 0 274 22
estimated 0 274 22
14,000 0 274 22
170mm 0 274 22
guns 0 274 22
and 0 274 22
hundreds 0 274 22
of 0 274 22
300mm 0 274 22
long-ranged 0 274 22
rocket 0 274 22
launchers 0 274 22
emplaced 0 274 22
in 0 274 22
caves 0 274 22
just 0 274 22
north 0 274 22
of 0 274 22
the 0 274 22
Demilitarized 0 274 22
Zone 0 274 22
between 0 274 22
the 0 274 22
two 0 274 22
Koreas. 0 274 22

They 0 274 23
threaten 0 274 23
almost 0 274 23
all 0 274 23
of 0 274 23
South 0 274 23
Korea’s 0 274 23
capital 0 274 23

north 0 274 23
of 0 274 23
the 0 274 23

and 0 274 23
key 0 274 23
airfields, 0 274 23
notably 0 274 23
Osan. 0 274 23

This 0 274 24
is 0 274 24
a 1 274 24
very 1 274 24
real 1 274 24
threat 1 274 24
– 0 274 24
one 0 274 24
that 0 274 24
is 0 274 24

of 0 274 28
this 0 274 28

it 0 274 29

a 0 274 29
key 0 274 29
demand 0 274 29
by 0 274 29
Kim. 0 274 29

This 0 274 30
column 0 274 30
has 0 274 30
been 0 274 30
calling 0 274 30
for 0 274 30
their 0 274 30
end 0 274 30
for 0 274 30
a 0 274 30

North 0 274 31
Korea 0 274 31
will 0 274 31
seemingly 0 274 31
halt 0 274 31
its 0 274 31
missile 0 274 31
tests. 0 274 31

This 0 274 32
is 0 274 32
not 0 274 32
the 0 274 32
‘denuclearization’ 0 274 32
of 0 274 32
North 0 274 32
Korea 0 274 32
that 0 274 32
has 0 274 32
been 0 274 32
bandied 0 274 32
about. 0 274 32

There 0 274 33
may 0 274 33
be 0 274 33
a 0 274 33
few 0 274 33
gestures 0 274 33
of 0 274 33

but 0 274 33
Kim 0 274 33

know 0 274 33
that 0 274 33
his 0 274 33

are 0 274 33
his 0 274 33
means 0 274 33
of 0 274 33
survival. 0 274 33

In 0 274 34
case 0 274 34
Kim 0 274 34
didn’t 0 274 34
remember 0 274 34
the 0 274 34
dire 0 274 34
fate 0 274 34
of 0 274 34

of 0 274 34
Libya’s 0 274 34
murdered 0 274 34

Khadaffi. 0 274 34

The 0 274 35
Singapore 0 274 35
summit 0 274 35
was 0 274 35
also 0 274 35
a 0 274 35

In 0 274 36
Asia, 0 274 36
preserving 0 274 36
‘face’ 0 274 36
is 0 274 36
essential. 0 274 36

Trump 0 274 37
completely 0 274 37
ignored 0 274 37
America’s 0 274 37
two 0 274 37
old 0 274 37
allies 0 274 37
after 0 274 37
his 0 274 37
meeting 0 274 37
with 0 274 37
Kim 0 274 37
– 0 274 37
who 0 274 37
routinely 0 274 37
blasts 0 274 37
Japan 0 274 37
and 0 274 37
South 0 274 37
Korea 0 274 37
as 0 274 37
‘America’s 1 274 37
stooges.’ 1 274 37
Instead, 0 274 37
Trump 0 274 37
sent 0 274 37
his 0 274 37
beginner 0 274 37
Secretary 0 274 37
of 0 274 37
State 0 274 37
Mike 0 274 37
Pompeo 0 274 37
to 0 274 37
explain 0 274 37
what 0 274 37
happened 0 274 37
in 0 274 37
Singapore, 0 274 37
inflicting 0 274 37
a 0 274 37
deep 0 274 37

was 0 274 38
a 0 274 38
terrible 1 274 38
insult 1 274 38
and 0 274 38
could 0 274 38

the 0 302 19

support 0 302 20

Sadly, 0 302 21
the 0 302 21

over 0 302 21

now, 0 302 22
a 0 302 22

into 0 302 22
war 0 302 22
with 0 302 22
Iran. 0 302 22

As 0 302 23
President 0 302 23
Donald 0 302 23

The 0 302 24

is 0 302 24
becoming 0 302 24

that 0 302 26

explicitly 0 302 26

president 0 302 28
in 0 302 28
a 0 302 28
mess 0 302 28
in 0 302 28
Iran,” 0 302 28
Carlson 0 302 28
said. 0 302 28

“Let’s 0 302 29
hope 0 302 29
that 0 302 29

exactly 0 302 29
what’s 0 302 29
going 0 302 29
on.” 0 302 29

Pointing 0 302 30
out 0 302 30
Trump’s 0 302 30
recent 0 302 30
attempts 0 302 30
at 0 302 30
diplomacy 0 302 30
with 0 302 30
North 0 302 30
Korea 0 302 30
and 0 302 30
Russia, 0 302 30
Col. 0 302 30
Macgregor 0 302 30
weighed 0 302 30
in, 0 302 30
noting 0 302 30
that 0 302 30
he 0 302 30
thinks 0 302 30
Trump 0 302 30
will 0 302 30
attempt 0 302 30
to 0 302 30
avoid 0 302 30
war 0 302 30
with 0 302 30
Iran. 0 302 30

However, 0 302 31
he 0 302 31
noted 0 302 31
that 0 302 31
a 0 302 31
false 0 302 31
flag 0 302 31
could 0 302 31
be 0 302 31
used 0 302 31
to 0 302 31
drag 0 302 31
us 0 302 31
into 0 302 31
it. 0 302 31

“I 0 302 32
think 0 302 32
the 0 302 32
president 0 302 32
needs 0 302 32
to 0 302 32
watch 0 302 32
carefully 0 302 32
for 0 302 32
the 0 302 32
potential 0 302 32
for 0 302 32
something 0 302 32
like 0 302 32
the 0 302 32
Gulf 0 302 32
of 0 302 32
Tonkin 0 302 32
incident,” 0 302 32
Col. 0 302 32
Macgregor 0 302 32
said. 0 302 32

“Many 0 302 33
of 0 302 33
your 0 302 33
viewers 0 302 33
may 0 302 33
not 0 302 33
remember 0 302 33
that 0 302 33
it 0 302 33
never 0 302 33
happened 0 302 33
and 0 302 33
we 0 302 33
could 0 302 33
very 0 302 33
well 0 302 33
be 0 302 33
treated 0 302 33
to 0 302 33
something 0 302 33
like 0 302 33
that 0 302 33
in 0 302 33
the 0 302 33
Gulf. 0 302 33

We 0 302 34
should 0 302 34
watch 0 302 34
for 0 302 34
that, 0 302 34
and 0 302 34
this 0 302 34
is 0 302 34
an 0 302 34
example 0 302 34
of 0 302 34
President 0 302 34
Trump’s 0 302 34
comments 0 302 34
on 0 302 34
fake 0 302 34
news, 0 302 34
he 0 302 34
should 0 302 34
not 0 302 34
be 0 302 34
sabotage 0 302 34
by 0 302 34
fake 0 302 34
news.” 0 302 34

Carlson 0 302 35
then 0 302 35
pointed 0 302 35
out 0 302 35
how 0 302 35
the 0 302 35
Trump 0 302 35
admin 0 302 35
has 0 302 35
reacted 0 302 35
to 0 302 35
fake 0 302 35
news 0 302 35
by 0 302 35
attacking 0 302 35
Syria—twice. 0 302 35

For 0 302 36
those 0 302 36
who 0 302 36
may 0 302 36
be 0 302 36
unaware, 0 302 36
the 0 302 36
plan 0 302 36
to 0 302 36
overthrow 0 302 36
Iran 0 302 36
has 0 302 36
long 0 302 36
been 0 302 36
in 0 302 36
the 0 302 36
works. 0 302 36

In 0 302 37
fact, 0 302 37
in 0 302 37
April 0 302 37
2012, 0 302 37
Pulitzer 0 302 37
Prize-winning 0 302 37
journalist, 0 302 37
Seymour 0 302 37
Hersh 0 302 37
reported 0 302 37
that 0 302 37

at 0 302 37
a 0 302 37
secret 0 302 37
site 0 302 37
in 0 302 37
Nevada 0 302 37
from 0 302 37
2005 0 302 37
to 0 302 37
2009. 0 302 37

MEK 0 302 38
is 0 302 38
the 0 302 38
Iranian 0 302 38
political-militant 0 302 38
organization 0 302 38
that 0 302 38
advocates 0 302 38
for 0 302 38
the 0 302 38
violent 0 302 38
overthrow 0 302 38
of 0 302 38
the 0 302 38
current 0 302 38
Iranian 0 302 38
regime. 0 302 38

They 0 302 39
are 0 302 39
hardly 0 302 39
quiet 0 302 39
about 0 302 39
it. 0 302 39

According 0 302 40
to 0 302 40
Hersh, 0 302 40
MEK 0 302 40
members 0 302 40
were 0 302 40
trained 0 302 40
in 0 302 40
intercepting 0 302 40
communications, 0 302 40
cryptography, 0 302 40
weaponry 0 302 40
and 0 302 40

at 0 302 40
the 0 302 40

until 0 302 40
President 0 302 40
Barack 0 302 40
Obama 0 302 40
took 0 302 40
office 0 302 40
in 0 302 40
2009. 0 302 40

Hersh 0 302 41
also 0 302 41
reported 0 302 41
additional 0 302 41
names 0 302 41
of 0 302 41
former 0 302 41
U.S. 0 302 41

paid 0 302 41
to 0 302 41
speak 0 302 41
in 0 302 41
support 0 302 41
of 0 302 41
MEK, 0 302 41
including 0 302 41
former 0 302 41
CIA 0 302 41
directors 0 302 41
James 0 302 41

Bolton. 0 302 42

Coincidentally, 0 302 43
MEK 0 302 43
was 0 302 43
classified 0 302 43
as 0 302 43
a 0 302 43
terrorist 0 302 43
organization 0 302 43
by 0 302 43
the 0 302 43
United 0 302 43
States 0 302 43
and 0 302 43
its 0 302 43
allies—during 0 302 43
this 0 302 43
training 0 302 43
period—until 0 302 43
they 0 302 43
suddenly 0 302 43
removed 0 302 43
them 0 302 43
from 0 302 43
the 0 302 43
list 0 302 43
in 0 302 43
2012. 0 302 43

While 0 302 44
the 0 302 44
current 0 302 44
Iranian 0 302 44
regime 0 302 44
is 0 302 44
certainly 0 302 44
no 0 302 44
bastion 0 302 44
of 0 302 44
freedom, 0 302 44
the 0 302 44
idea 0 302 44
that 0 302 44
US 0 302 44
intervention 0 302 44
or 0 302 44
a 0 302 44
violent 0 302 44
revolution 0 302 44
would 0 302 44
be 0 302 44
beneficial 0 302 44
for 0 302 44
the 0 302 44
people 0 302 44
of 0 302 44
Iran 0 302 44
is 0 302 44
outright 1 302 44
insane. 1 302 44

To 0 302 45
see 0 302 45
what 0 302 45
US 0 302 45
intervention—through 0 302 45
military 0 302 45
support 0 302 45
and 0 302 45
the 0 302 45
support 0 302 45
of 0 302 45
‘protesters’—does 0 302 45
to 0 302 45
countries, 0 302 45
one 0 302 45
need 0 302 45
only 0 302 45
look 0 302 45
at 0 302 45
Syria, 0 302 45
Iraq, 0 302 45
Afghanistan, 0 302 45
and 0 302 45
Libya 0 302 45
to 0 302 45
see 0 302 45
the 0 302 45
horrific 1 302 45
death 0 302 45

and 0 302 45
war-ravaged 1 302 45
dystopias 1 302 45
left 0 302 45
in 0 302 45
America’s 0 302 45

To 0 302 46
those 0 302 46
paying 0 302 46
attention 0 302 46
over 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
years, 0 302 46
Trump’s 0 302 46
desire 0 302 46
to 0 302 46
intervene 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
Iran, 0 302 46
and 0 302 46
his 0 302 46
subsequent 0 302 46
support 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
media 0 302 46
should 0 302 46
come 0 302 46
as 0 302 46
no 0 302 46
surprise 0 302 46
as 0 302 46
it 0 302 46
has 0 302 46
been 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
plan 0 302 46
since 0 302 46
Bill 0 302 46
Clinton 0 302 46
was 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
office 0 302 46
and 0 302 46
was 0 302 46
documented 0 302 46
in 0 302 46
the 0 302 46
neoconservative 0 302 46
PNAC 0 302 46
report. 0 302 46

This 0 302 47
was 0 302 47
even 0 302 47
admitted 0 302 47
by 0 302 47
General 0 302 47

former 0 302 47
Supreme 0 302 47

NATO, 0 302 47
that 0 302 47
the 0 302 47
U.S. 0 302 47
planned 0 302 47
on 0 302 47
going 0 302 47
to 0 302 47
war 0 302 47
with 0 302 47
Iran, 0 302 47
according 0 302 47
to 0 302 47
a 0 302 47
2001 0 302 47
memo 0 302 47
from 0 302 47
the 0 302 47
U.S. 0 302 47
Secretary 0 302 47
of 0 302 47
Defense. 0 302 47

“This 0 302 48
is 0 302 48
a 0 302 48

we’re 0 302 48
going 0 302 48

out 0 302 48
seven 0 302 48
countries 0 302 48
in 0 302 48
five 0 302 48

Clark 0 302 48
said. 0 302 48

“Starting 0 302 49
with 0 302 49

The 0 327 6

to 0 327 6
create 0 327 6
problems 0 327 6
for 0 327 6
Russia 0 327 6
that 0 327 6

the 1 327 9

Donald 0 327 10
Trump 0 327 10
is 1 327 10
totally 1 327 10
correct 1 327 10
that 0 327 10
nuclear 0 327 10
war 0 327 10
would 0 327 10
be 0 327 10
a 0 327 10
terminable 0 327 10
event 0 327 10
and 0 327 10
that 0 327 10
nothing 1 327 10
is 1 327 10
more 1 327 10
important 1 327 10
than 0 327 10
restoring 0 327 10
a 0 327 10

The 0 327 11
problem 0 327 11
is 0 327 11
that 0 327 11
the 0 327 11
military/security 0 327 11
complex 0 327 11
sees 0 327 11
it 0 327 11
differently. 0 327 11

After 0 327 12
70 0 327 12
years 0 327 12

entrenchment 0 327 12
the 0 327 12

is 0 327 12
an 0 327 12
independent 0 327 12
political 0 327 12
force. 0 327 12

in 0 327 13

to 0 327 13
no 0 327 13

From 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
standpoint 0 327 14
of 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
military/security 0 327 14
complex, 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
problem 0 327 14
of 0 327 14
normalizing 0 327 14
relations 0 327 14
with 0 327 14
Russia 0 327 14
is 0 327 14
that 0 327 14
it 0 327 14
downgrades 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
“Russian 0 327 14
threat” 0 327 14
that 0 327 14
is 0 327 14
so 0 327 14
essential 0 327 14
to 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
$1,000 0 327 14

and 0 327 14
the 0 327 14
power 0 327 14
that 0 327 14
such 0 327 14
a 0 327 14

conveys. 0 327 14

a 0 327 19
case 0 327 19
against 0 327 19

After 0 327 20
two 0 327 20
years 0 327 20
the 0 327 20
only 0 327 20
evidence 0 327 20
we 0 327 20
have 0 327 20
of 0 327 20
Russiagate 0 327 20
is 0 327 20
that 0 327 20
it 1 327 20
is 1 327 20
a 1 327 20
conspiracy 1 327 20
against 1 327 20
President 1 327 20
Trump 1 327 20
and 1 327 20
the 1 327 20
American 1 327 20
people. 1 327 20

Indeed, 0 327 21
Mueller, 0 327 21
fully 0 327 21
aware 0 327 21
that 0 327 21
there 0 327 21
was 0 327 21
no 0 327 21
Trump-Putin 0 327 21
conspiracy, 0 327 21
has 0 327 21
not 0 327 21
bothered 0 327 21
to 0 327 21
look 0 327 21
for 0 327 21
any 0 327 21

that 0 327 21
did 0 327 21
not 0 327 21
happen. 0 327 21

pulled 0 327 22
out 0 327 22

hat 0 327 22
some 0 327 22
phony 0 327 22

Russians 0 327 22

it 0 327 22
look 0 327 22
like 0 327 22
there 0 327 22
was 0 327 22
a 0 327 22
conspiracy 0 327 22
without 0 327 22
having 0 327 22
to 0 327 22
prove 0 327 22
it, 0 327 22
but 0 327 22
his 0 327 22
main 0 327 22

has 0 327 22
been 0 327 22
on 0 327 22
framing 0 327 22
Paul 0 327 22

Mueller’s 0 327 23
investigation 0 327 23
of 0 327 23
Manafort 0 327 23
has 0 327 23
nothing 0 327 23
to 0 327 23
do 0 327 23
with 0 327 23
the 0 327 23
Russiagate 0 327 23
story 0 327 23
line. 0 327 23

Manafort’s 0 327 24
alleged 0 327 24
crimes 0 327 24
are 0 327 24
far 0 327 24
outside 0 327 24
Mueller’s 0 327 24
mandate 0 327 24
and 0 327 24
took 0 327 24
place, 0 327 24
if 0 327 24
they 0 327 24
did, 0 327 24
years 0 327 24
before 0 327 24
the 0 327 24
alleged 0 327 24
events 0 327 24
of 0 327 24
Russiagate. 0 327 24

Manafort’s 0 327 25
conviction 0 327 25
by 0 327 25
a 0 327 25
jury 0 327 25
on 0 327 25
8 0 327 25
of 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
18 0 327 25
counts 0 327 25
is 0 327 25
being 0 327 25
misrepresented 0 327 25
by 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
Trump-hating 0 327 25
presstitutes 0 327 25
as 0 327 25
vindication 0 327 25
of 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
Russiagate 0 327 25
investigation 0 327 25
and 0 327 25
as 0 327 25
“A 0 327 25
dark 0 327 25
day 0 327 25
for 0 327 25
Trump,” 0 327 25
with 0 327 25
the 0 327 25
presstitutes 0 327 25
suggesting 0 327 25
a 0 327 25
Watergate 0 327 25
parallel 0 327 25
that 0 327 25
will 0 327 25
force 0 327 25
Trump 0 327 25
from 0 327 25
office. 0 327 25

Manafort 0 327 26
was 0 327 26
found 0 327 26
guilty 0 327 26
not 0 327 26
of 0 327 26
Russiagate, 0 327 26
but 0 327 26
of 0 327 26
income 0 327 26
tax 0 327 26
evasion 0 327 26
and 0 327 26
misrepresenting 0 327 26
his 0 327 26
financial 0 327 26
position 0 327 26
on 0 327 26
a 0 327 26
loan 0 327 26
application. 0 327 26

We 0 327 27
do 0 327 27
not 0 327 27
know 0 327 27
if 0 327 27
Manafort 0 327 27
is 0 327 27
guilty 0 327 27
or 0 327 27
is 0 327 27
simply 0 327 27
a 0 327 27
victim 0 327 27
of 0 327 27
Mueller’s 0 327 27
frameup 0 327 27
and 0 327 27
an 1 327 27
incompetent 1 327 27
jury. 1 327 27

American 0 327 28
juries 0 327 28
are 0 327 28
notoriously 0 327 28
incompetent, 0 327 28
which 0 327 28
is 0 327 28
why 0 327 28
97% 0 327 28
of 0 327 28
felony 0 327 28
indictments 0 327 28
are 0 327 28
settled 0 327 28
with 0 327 28
a 0 327 28
plea 0 327 28
bargain. 0 327 28

Even 0 327 29
the 0 327 29
innocent 0 327 29
had 0 327 29
rather 0 327 29
work 0 327 29
out 0 327 29
a 0 327 29
plea 0 327 29
arrangement 0 327 29
and 0 327 29
admit 0 327 29
to 0 327 29
something 0 327 29
that 0 327 29
they 0 327 29
did 0 327 29
not 0 327 29
do 0 327 29
than 0 327 29
to 0 327 29
face 0 327 29
an 1 327 29
insouciant 1 327 29
American 1 327 29
jury. 1 327 29

Remember 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
jury 0 327 30
that 0 327 30
condemned 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
survivors 0 327 30
of 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
FBI’s 0 327 30
massacre 0 327 30
of 0 327 30
the 0 327 30
Branch 0 327 30
Davidians 0 327 30
in 0 327 30
Waco, 0 327 30

to 0 327 30

locked 0 327 30
away 0 327 30
for 0 327 30
many 0 327 30
years 0 327 30
so 0 327 30
that 0 327 30
they 0 327 30
could 0 327 30
not 0 327 30
talk 0 327 30

is 0 327 31

much 0 327 31
of 0 327 31
a 0 327 31

the 0 327 31

giving 0 327 42
false 0 327 42
testimony 0 327 42
against 0 327 42

This 0 327 43
tactic 0 327 43
is 0 327 43
used 0 327 43
every 0 327 43
day 0 327 43
by 0 327 43
state, 0 327 43
local, 0 327 43

believe 0 327 44
the 0 327 44

it 0 327 45
didn’t, 0 327 45
or 0 327 45
hasn’t, 0 327 45
worked. 0 327 45

Yet. 0 327 46

Manafort 0 327 47
is 0 327 47
due 0 327 47
for 0 327 47
a 0 327 47
second 0 327 47
trial, 0 327 47
this 0 327 47
time 0 327 47
for 0 327 47
allegely 0 327 47
acting 0 327 47
as 0 327 47
an 0 327 47
unregistered 0 327 47
foreign 0 327 47
agent 0 327 47
for 0 327 47
Ukrainian 0 327 47
interests 0 327 47

for 0 327 47
making 0 327 47
false 0 327 47
statements 0 327 47
not 0 327 47
under 0 327 47
oath 0 327 47
to 0 327 47
the 0 327 47
US 0 327 47
government. 0 327 47

Reportedly, 0 327 48
Manafort 0 327 48
is 0 327 48
being 0 327 48
held 0 327 48
in 0 327 48
solitary 0 327 48
confinement, 0 327 48
a 0 327 48
form 0 327 48
of 0 327 48
torture 0 327 48
designed 0 327 48
to 0 327 48
break 0 327 48
a 0 327 48
person’s 0 327 48
spirit. 0 327 48

Like 0 327 49
Manafort’s 0 327 49
first 0 327 49
trial, 0 327 49
his 0 327 49
second 0 327 49
trial 0 327 49
has 0 327 49
nothing 0 327 49
whatsoever 0 327 49
to 0 327 49
do 0 327 49
with 0 327 49
Russiagate, 0 327 49
but 0 327 49
you 0 327 49
will 0 327 49
never 0 327 49
learn 0 327 49
that 0 327 49
from 0 327 49
the 0 327 49
presstitute 0 327 49
media 0 327 49
or 0 327 49
from 0 327 49
the 0 327 49
Democratic 0 327 49
Party. 0 327 49

Manafort 0 327 50
can 0 327 50
still 0 327 50
be 0 327 50
coerced 0 327 50
to 0 327 50
say 0 327 50
something 0 327 50
that 0 327 50
can 0 327 50
be 0 327 50
used 0 327 50
to 0 327 50
drive 0 327 50
Trump 0 327 50
from 0 327 50
office. 0 327 50

What 0 327 51
about 0 327 51
Michael 0 327 51
Cohen, 0 327 51
a 0 327 51
former 0 327 51
attorney 0 327 51
for 0 327 51
Trump? 0 327 51

Mueller 0 327 52
saw 0 327 52
no 0 327 52
value 0 327 52
in 0 327 52
the 0 327 52
Cohen 0 327 52
case 0 327 52
and 0 327 52
passed 0 327 52
it 0 327 52
off 0 327 52
to 0 327 52
a 0 327 52
regular 0 327 52
US 0 327 52
attorney 0 327 52
to 0 327 52
prosecute. 0 327 52

Therefore, 0 327 53
it 0 327 53
would 0 327 53
appear 0 327 53
not 0 327 53
to 0 327 53
be 0 327 53
part 0 327 53
of 0 327 53
the 0 327 53
Russiagate 0 327 53
investigation. 0 327 53

Cohen 0 327 54
avoided 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
jury 0 327 54
and 0 327 54
said 0 327 54
he 0 327 54
was 0 327 54
guilty 0 327 54
of 0 327 54
five 0 327 54
counts 0 327 54
of 0 327 54
personal 0 327 54
income 0 327 54
tax 0 327 54
evasion, 0 327 54
one 0 327 54
count 0 327 54
of 0 327 54
making 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
false 0 327 54
statement 0 327 54
to 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
financial 0 327 54
institution 0 327 54
in 0 327 54
order 0 327 54
to 0 327 54
get 0 327 54
a 0 327 54
loan, 0 327 54
and 0 327 54
two 0 327 54
counts 0 327 54
related 0 327 54
to 0 327 54
illegal 0 327 54
campaign 0 327 54
contributions. 0 327 54

With 0 327 55
regard 0 327 55
to 0 327 55
the 0 327 55
campagin 0 327 55
contributions, 0 327 55
he 0 327 55
contradicted 0 327 55
his 0 327 55
previous 0 327 55
statements. 0 327 55

He 0 327 56
said 0 327 56
that 0 327 56
on 0 327 56
Trump’s 0 327 56
instruction, 0 327 56
he 0 327 56
paid 0 327 56
off 0 327 56
two 0 327 56
women 0 327 56
who 0 327 56
were 0 327 56
claiming 0 327 56
sexual 0 327 56
affairs 0 327 56
with 0 327 56
Trump. 0 327 56

The 1 327 57
intricacies 1 327 57
of 1 327 57
American 1 327 57
laws 1 327 57
relating 1 327 57
to 1 327 57
politics 1 327 57
are 1 327 57
often 1 327 57
unclear. 1 327 57

Apparently, 0 327 58
the 0 327 58
charge 0 327 58
is 0 327 58
that 0 327 58
Cohen 0 327 58
used 0 327 58
monies 0 327 58
raised 0 327 58
for 0 327 58
a 0 327 58
political 0 327 58
campaign 0 327 58
to 0 327 58
pay 0 327 58
off 0 327 58
two 0 327 58
women, 0 327 58
who 0 327 58
saw 0 327 58
and 0 327 58
capitalized 0 327 58
on 0 327 58
an 0 327 58
opportunity 0 327 58
to 0 327 58
extort 0 327 58
Trump 0 327 58
for 0 327 58
money, 0 327 58
and 0 327 58
this 0 327 58
was 0 327 58
an 0 327 58
illegal 0 327 58
use 0 327 58
of 0 327 58
the 0 327 58
money. 0 327 58

Why 1 327 59
a 1 327 59
lawyer 1 327 59
would 1 327 59
pay 1 327 59
off 1 327 59
women, 1 327 59
whose 1 327 59
stories 1 327 59
might 1 327 59
or 1 327 59
might 1 327 59
not 1 327 59
be 1 327 59
true, 1 327 59
in 1 327 59
an 1 327 59
illegal 1 327 59
way 1 327 59
when 1 327 59
his 1 327 59
client 1 327 59
is 1 327 59
a 1 327 59
multi-billionaire 1 327 59
doesn’t 1 327 59
make 1 327 59
much 1 327 59
sense. 1 327 59

But 1 327 60
these 1 327 60
are 1 327 60
not 1 327 60
the 1 327 60
kind 1 327 60
of 1 327 60
questions 1 327 60
that 1 327 60
the 1 327 60
presstitutes 1 327 60
are 1 327 60
interested 1 327 60
in. 1 327 60

Nevertheless, 0 327 61
Cohen’s 0 327 61
plea 0 327 61
is 0 327 61
associated 0 327 61
with 0 327 61
a 0 327 61
case 0 327 61
brought 0 327 61
by 0 327 61
another 0 327 61
prosecutor, 0 327 61
not 0 327 61
by 0 327 61
Special 0 327 61
Prosecutor 0 327 61

up 0 327 72

himself 0 327 72

— 0 327 72
I 0 327 72
am 0 327 72
surprised 0 327 72
that 0 327 72

Whoever 0 327 73
advised 0 327 73
Trump 0 327 73
to 0 327 73
appoint 0 327 73
Rosenstein, 0 327 73
a 1 327 73
person 1 327 73
committed 1 327 73
to 1 327 73
Trump’s 1 327 73
destruction, 1 327 73
as 0 327 73
deputy 0 327 73
attorney 0 327 73
general, 0 327 73
which 0 327 73
is 0 327 73
the 0 327 73
ruling 0 327 73
position 0 327 73
in 0 327 73
view 0 327 73
of 0 327 73

weak 0 327 73

stupid 0 327 73
AG 0 327 73

recused 0 327 73
himself 0 327 73
from 0 327 73
the 0 327 73
Russiagate 0 327 73
investigation, 0 327 73
intended 0 327 73
Trump’s 0 327 73
destruction. 0 327 73

A 0 327 74
disreputable 0 327 74
person 0 327 74
committed 0 327 74
to 0 327 74
Trump’s 0 327 74
destruction 0 327 74
is 0 327 74
appointed 0 327 74
by 0 327 74
Trump 0 327 74
to 0 327 74
destroy 0 327 74
Trump. 0 327 74

How 0 327 75
can 0 327 75
a 0 327 75
person 0 327 75
so 0 327 75
unclued 0 327 75
survive? 0 327 75

As 0 327 76
I 0 327 76
wrote 0 327 76
during 0 327 76
the 0 327 76
presidential 0 327 76
campaign, 0 327 76
Trump 0 327 76
has 0 327 76
no 0 327 76
idea 0 327 76
of 0 327 76
Washington 0 327 76
and 0 327 76
no 0 327 76
idea 0 327 76
who 0 327 76
to 0 327 76
appoint 0 327 76
who 0 327 76
would 0 327 76
support 0 327 76
him 0 327 76
rather 0 327 76
than 0 327 76
work 0 327 76
against 0 327 76
him. 0 327 76

Consequently, 0 327 77
he 0 327 77
has 0 327 77
a 0 327 77
government 0 327 77
working 0 327 77
against 0 327 77
him. 0 327 77

Senators 0 327 78
John 0 327 78
McCain 0 327 78
and 0 327 78
Lindsey 0 327 78
Graham 0 327 78
are 0 327 78
working 0 327 78
to 0 327 78
prevent 0 327 78
the 0 327 78
Republican 0 327 78
Party 0 327 78
from 0 327 78
supporting 0 327 78
the 0 327 78
party’s 0 327 78
president. 0 327 78

They 0 327 79
could 0 327 79
easily 0 327 79
succeed. 0 327 79

The 1 327 80
entirety 1 327 80
of 1 327 80
the 1 327 80
House 1 327 80

Senate 1 327 80
of 1 327 80

What 0 327 81
can 0 327 81
President 0 327 81
Trump 0 327 81
do? 0 327 81

He 0 327 82
could 0 327 82
fight, 0 327 82
not 0 327 82
with 0 327 82
words 0 327 82
on 0 327 82

but 0 327 82
with 0 327 82
the 0 327 82
powers 0 327 82
of 0 327 82
the 0 327 82

more 0 327 83

He 0 327 96
is 0 327 96
in 0 327 96
Israel’s 0 327 96
hands, 0 327 96
hoping 0 327 96
that 0 327 96

power 0 327 96

the 0 327 96

for 0 327 97

Militarily, 0 327 100
Israel 0 327 100
is 0 327 100
of 0 327 100
no 0 327 100

nothing 0 327 101

murdering 0 327 101
unarmed 0 327 101

Israel 0 327 102

too 0 327 102
cowardly 0 327 102
to 0 327 102
try 0 327 102
it 0 327 102
a 0 327 102
third 0 327 102
time, 0 327 102
and 0 327 102
is 0 327 102
relying 0 327 102
on 0 327 102
the 0 327 102
stupid 0 327 102
Americans 0 327 102

the 0 327 102

at 1 327 103
America 1 327 103

Israel, 1 327 103
and 0 327 103
what 0 327 103
does 0 327 103
the 0 327 103
world 0 327 103
see? 0 327 103

Two 0 327 104
countries, 0 327 104
both 0 327 104
the 0 327 104
result 0 327 104
of 0 327 104
exterminating 0 327 104
the 0 327 104
native 0 327 104
populations, 0 327 104
distrusted 0 327 104
and 0 327 104
universally 0 327 104
hated, 0 327 104
both 0 327 104
of 0 327 104
which 0 327 104
survive 0 327 104
by 0 327 104
purhasing 0 327 104
the 0 327 104
governments 0 327 104
of 0 327 104
other 0 327 104
countries 0 327 104
and 0 327 104
by 0 327 104
endless 0 327 104
lies 0 327 104
that 0 327 104
describe 0 327 104
everyone 0 327 104
but 0 327 104
themselves 0 327 104
and 0 327 104
their 0 327 104
vassals 0 327 104
as 0 327 104
evil 0 327 104
criminals 0 327 104
that 0 327 104
must 0 327 104
be 0 327 104
destroyed. 0 327 104

For 0 327 105
example, 0 327 105
the 0 327 105
Gaza 0 327 105
Strip, 0 327 105
the 0 327 105

ever 0 327 105
in 0 327 105
the 0 327 105
world, 0 327 105
is 0 327 105
being 0 327 105
systematically 0 327 105
destroyed 0 327 105
along 0 327 105
with 0 327 105
all 0 327 105
life 0 327 105
within 0 327 105
it 0 327 105
by 0 327 105
Israel 0 327 105
under 1 327 105
cover 1 327 105
of 1 327 105
the 1 327 105
obvious 1 327 105
and 1 327 105
transparanent 1 327 105
lie 1 327 105
that 0 327 105
all 0 327 105
within 0 327 105
Gaza 0 327 105
are 0 327 105
terrorists 0 327 105
outfitted 0 327 105
with 0 327 105
bomb 0 327 105
belts 0 327 105
who 0 327 105
are 0 327 105
committed 0 327 105
to 0 327 105
the 0 327 105
destruction 0 327 105
of 0 327 105
Israel. 0 327 105

Not 0 327 106
only 0 327 106
men 0 327 106
of 0 327 106
fighting 0 327 106
age, 0 327 106
but 0 327 106
also 0 327 106
old 0 327 106
men, 0 327 106
pregnant 0 327 106
women, 0 327 106
children, 0 327 106
all 0 327 106
Palestinians 0 327 106
are 0 327 106
being 0 327 106
murdered 0 327 106
by 0 327 106
the 0 327 106
Israeli 0 327 106
military. 0 327 106

The 0 327 107
United 0 327 107
States 0 327 107
Secretary 0 327 107
of 0 327 107
State 0 327 107
agrees 0 327 107
with 0 327 107
Israel 0 327 107
that 0 327 107
all 0 327 107
Palestinians 0 327 107
must 0 327 107
be 0 327 107
destroyed, 0 327 107
the 1 327 107
sooner 1 327 107
the 1 327 107
better. 1 327 107

The 0 327 108
Chinese 0 327 108
are 0 327 108
busy 0 327 108
taking 0 327 108
advantage 0 327 108
of 0 327 108
the 0 327 108
financial 0 327 108
opportunities 0 327 108
that 0 327 108
the 1 327 108
idiot 1 327 108
Americans 1 327 108
forfeit, 0 327 108
but 0 327 108
otherwise 0 327 108
do 0 327 108
not 0 327 108
seem 0 327 108
to 0 327 108
have 0 327 108
any 0 327 108
strategic 0 327 108
sense 0 327 108
of 0 327 108
how 0 327 108
to 0 327 108
proceed 0 327 108
in 0 327 108
the 0 327 108
drama 0 327 108
unfolding 0 327 108
in 0 327 108
front 0 327 108
of 0 327 108
their 0 327 108
eyes. 0 327 108

For 0 327 109
China, 0 327 109
money 0 327 109
is 0 327 109
now 0 327 109
all. 0 327 109

The 0 327 110
Russians 0 327 110
are 0 327 110
infected 0 327 110
with 0 327 110
the 0 327 110
American 0 327 110
propaganda 0 327 110
infused 1 327 110
into 1 327 110
their 1 327 110
veins 1 327 110
during 0 327 110
the 0 327 110
Yeltsin 0 327 110
era 0 327 110
when 0 327 110
Russia 0 327 110
was 0 327 110
an 0 327 110
American 0 327 110
puppet 0 327 110
state. 0 327 110

Slowly, 0 327 111
if 0 327 111
not 0 327 111
surely, 0 327 111
the 0 327 111
Russians 0 327 111
are 0 327 111
coming 0 327 111
to 0 327 111
their 0 327 111
senses 0 327 111
and 0 327 111
realizing 0 327 111
that 0 327 111
they 0 327 111
have 0 327 111
no 0 327 111
American 0 327 111
“partner.” 0 327 111

If 1 327 112
Trump 1 327 112
is 1 327 112
defeated 1 327 112
and 1 327 112
moved 1 327 112
off 1 327 112
the 1 327 112
table, 1 327 112
what 1 327 112
happens 1 327 112
when 1 327 112
Russia 1 327 112
and 1 327 112
China 1 327 112
finally 1 327 112
realize 1 327 112
that 1 327 112
there 1 327 112
is 1 327 112
to 1 327 112
be 1 327 112
no 1 327 112
conciliation 1 327 112
with 1 327 112
Washington? 1 327 112

When 1 327 113
all 1 327 113
the 1 327 113
false 1 327 113
hopes 1 327 113
and 1 327 113
bets 1 327 113
of 1 327 113
the 1 327 113
Russian 1 327 113
and 1 327 113
Chinese 1 327 113
governments 1 327 113
of 1 327 113
conciliation 1 327 113
on 1 327 113
the 1 327 113
basis 1 327 113
of 1 327 113
mutual 1 327 113
economic 1 327 113
interests 1 327 113
come 1 327 113
to 1 327 113
naught, 1 327 113
what 1 327 113
happens? 1 327 113

It 1 327 114
will 1 327 114
be 1 327 114
the 1 327 114
end 1 327 114
of 1 327 114
life 1 327 114
on 1 327 114
earth. 1 327 114

The 0 327 115
Russiagate 0 327 115
“investigation” 0 327 115
appears 0 327 115
to 0 327 115
be 0 327 115
timed 0 327 115
to 0 327 115
influence 0 327 115
the 0 327 115
midterm 0 327 115
elections 0 327 115
with 0 327 115
unsubstantiated 0 327 115
accusations 0 327 115
made 0 327 115
just 0 327 115
before 0 327 115
the 0 327 115
elections 0 327 115
in 0 327 115
an 0 327 115
attempt 0 327 115
to 0 327 115
produce 0 327 115
a 0 327 115
Democratic 0 327 115
Congress 0 327 115
that 0 327 115
would 0 327 115
impeach 0 327 115
President 0 327 115
Trump 0 327 115
on 0 327 115
false 0 327 115
charges. 0 327 115

The 0 327 116
presstitutes 0 327 116
would 0 327 116
cover 0 327 116
up 0 327 116
the 0 327 116
frameup. 0 327 116

In 0 327 117
other 0 327 117
words, 0 327 117
the 0 327 117
real 0 327 117
election 0 327 117
meddling 0 327 117
is 0 327 117
being 0 327 117
done 0 327 117
by 0 327 117
the 0 327 117
Russiagate 0 327 117
“investigation.” 0 327 117
See 0 327 117
here 0 327 117
and 0 327 117
here. 0 327 117

Such 1 327 118
an 1 327 118
impeachment 1 327 118
would 1 327 118
be 1 327 118
a 1 327 118
coup. 1 327 118

The 1 327 119
consequence 1 327 119
would 1 327 119
be 1 327 119
deep 1 327 119
and 1 327 119
permanent 1 327 119
divisions 1 327 119
in 1 327 119
American 1 327 119
political 1 327 119
life 1 327 119
and 1 327 119
more 1 327 119
rabid 1 327 119
Russiaphobia 1 327 119
that 1 327 119
would 1 327 119
result 1 327 119
in 1 327 119
war. 1 327 119

The 0 327 120
danger 0 327 120
is 0 327 120
real 0 327 120
that 0 327 120

Paul 0 89 15
Hunter, 0 89 15
a 0 89 15
professor 0 89 15
of 0 89 15
health 0 89 15
protection 0 89 15
at 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
world-renowned 0 89 15
University 0 89 15
of 0 89 15
East 0 89 15
Anglia, 0 89 15
was 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
first 0 89 15
expert 0 89 15
to 0 89 15
predict 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
plague 0 89 15
could 0 89 15
travel 0 89 15
across 0 89 15
the 0 89 15
sea. 0 89 15

He 0 89 16
previously 0 89 16
said: 0 89 16
“The 0 89 16
big 0 89 16
anxiety 0 89 16
is 0 89 16
it 0 89 16
could 0 89 16
spread 0 89 16
to 0 89 16
mainland 0 89 16
Africa, 0 89 16
it’s 0 89 16
not 0 89 16
probable, 0 89 16
but 0 89 16
certainly 0 89 16
possible, 0 89 16
that 0 89 16
might 0 89 16
then 0 89 16
be 0 89 16
difficult 0 89 16
to 0 89 16
control. 0 89 16

If 1 89 17
we 1 89 17
don’t 1 89 17
carry 1 89 17
on 1 89 17
doing 1 89 17
stuff 1 89 17
here, 1 89 17
at 1 89 17
one 1 89 17
point 1 89 17
something 1 89 17
will 1 89 17
happen 1 89 17
and 1 89 17
it 1 89 17
will 1 89 17
get 1 89 17
out 1 89 17
of 1 89 17
our 1 89 17
control 1 89 17
and 1 89 17
cause 1 89 17
huge 1 89 17
devastation 1 89 17
all 1 89 17
around 1 89 17
the 1 89 17
world.” 1 89 17
There 0 89 17
is 0 89 17
always 0 89 17
a 0 89 17
risk 0 89 17
with 0 89 17
travel 0 89 17
that 0 89 17
the 0 89 17
disease 1 89 17
will 1 89 17
spread 1 89 17
globally, 1 89 17
Hunter 0 89 17
added. 0 89 17

“We 0 89 18
don’t 0 89 18
want 0 89 18
a 0 89 18
situation 0 89 18
where 0 89 18
the 0 89 18
disease 0 89 18
spreads 0 89 18
so 0 89 18
fast 0 89 18
it 0 89 18
gets 0 89 18
out 0 89 18
of 0 89 18
control. 0 89 18

We 0 89 19
are 0 89 19
talking 0 89 19
about 0 89 19
it 0 89 19
spreading 0 89 19
in 0 89 19
days 0 89 19
rather 0 89 19
than 0 89 19
weeks.” 0 89 19
But 0 89 19
Hunter 0 89 19
is 0 89 19
adamant 0 89 19
that 0 89 19
a 0 89 19
well-developed 0 89 19
country 0 89 19
could 0 89 19
manage 0 89 19
the 0 89 19
plague 0 89 19
should 0 89 19
a 0 89 19
global 0 89 19
outbreak 0 89 19
occur. 0 89 19

Hopefully, 0 89 20
most 0 89 20
will 0 89 20
never 0 89 20
have 0 89 20
to 0 89 20
find 0 89 20
out 0 89 20
how 0 89 20
well 0 89 20
another 0 89 20
country 0 89 20
can 0 89 20
manage 0 89 20
this 0 89 20
infection. 0 89 20

A 0 89 21
few 0 89 21
health 0 89 21
experts 0 89 21
have 0 89 21
warned 0 89 21
that 0 89 21
there 0 89 21
is 0 89 21
no 0 89 21
threat 0 89 21
to 0 89 21
the 0 89 21
UK, 0 89 21
however, 0 89 21
some 1 89 21
have 1 89 21
warned 1 89 21
the 1 89 21
plague 1 89 21
outbreak 1 89 21
will 1 89 21
certainly 1 89 21
spread 1 89 21
to 1 89 21
the 1 89 21
region. 1 89 21

Richard 0 89 22
Conroy, 0 89 22
the 0 89 22
founder 0 89 22
of 0 89 22
Sick 0 89 22
Holiday, 0 89 22
has 0 89 22
sent 0 89 22
a 0 89 22
chilling 1 89 22
warning 1 89 22
to 0 89 22
UK 0 89 22
authorities. 0 89 22

Conway 0 89 23
is 0 89 23
saying 1 89 23
it’s 1 89 23
“only 1 89 23
a 1 89 23
matter 1 89 23
of 1 89 23
time” 1 89 23
before 1 89 23
the 1 89 23
disease 1 89 23
arrives 1 89 23
on 1 89 23
British 1 89 23
soil. 1 89 23

Conroy 0 89 24
warned 1 89 24
it 1 89 24
is 1 89 24
inevitable 1 89 24
that 1 89 24
the 1 89 24
plague 1 89 24
will 1 89 24
spread 1 89 24
due 0 89 24
to 0 89 24
the 0 89 24
vast 0 89 24
movement 0 89 24
of 0 89 24
people 0 89 24
across 0 89 24
the 0 89 24
globe. 0 89 24

“I 1 89 25
believe 1 89 25
that 1 89 25
it’s 1 89 25
100 1 89 25
percent 1 89 25
likely 1 89 25
that 1 89 25
plague 1 89 25
will 1 89 25
arrive 1 89 25
in 1 89 25
the 1 89 25
UK 1 89 25
once 1 89 25
more 1 89 25
– 1 89 25
it’s 1 89 25
just 1 89 25
a 1 89 25
question 1 89 25
of 1 89 25
‘when’, 1 89 25
not 1 89 25
‘if’. 1 89 25

And 0 89 26
it’s 0 89 26
not 0 89 26
an 0 89 26
exaggeration 0 89 26
to 0 89 26
say 0 89 26
that 0 89 26
this 0 89 26
is 0 89 26
a 0 89 26
real 0 89 26
threat 0 89 26
– 0 89 26
a 1 89 26
ticking 1 89 26
time 1 89 26
bomb 1 89 26
that’s 1 89 26
waiting 1 89 26
to 1 89 26
decimate 1 89 26
the 1 89 26

Conroy 0 89 26
continued. 0 89 26

“With 0 89 26

the 0 89 26

I 0 90 2
am 0 90 2
going 0 90 2
to 0 90 2
share 0 90 2
some 0 90 2
things 0 90 2
with 0 90 2
you 0 90 2
in 0 90 2
this 0 90 2
article 0 90 2
that 0 90 2
are 0 90 2
deeply 1 90 2
disturbing, 1 90 2
but 0 90 2
it 0 90 2
is 0 90 2
for 0 90 2
a 0 90 2
purpose. 0 90 2

The 0 90 3
status 0 90 3
quo 0 90 3
is 0 90 3
not 0 90 3
acceptable 0 90 3
in 0 90 3
Washington, 0 90 3
and 1 90 3
once 1 90 3
people 1 90 3
truly 1 90 3
understand 1 90 3
how 1 90 3
deep 1 90 3
the 1 90 3
corruaption 1 90 3
runs 1 90 3
I 1 90 3
believe 1 90 3
that 1 90 3
they 1 90 3
will 1 90 3
get 1 90 3
motivated 1 90 3
to 1 90 3
finally 1 90 3
drain 1 90 3
the 1 90 3

for 1 90 3

So 0 90 4
yes, 0 90 4
I 0 90 4
am 0 90 4
going 0 90 4
to 0 90 4
share 0 90 4
some 0 90 4
things 0 90 4
in 0 90 4
this 0 90 4
article 0 90 4
that 0 90 4
are 0 90 4
truly 1 90 4
disgusting, 1 90 4
but 0 90 4
the 0 90 4
goal 0 90 4
is 0 90 4
to 0 90 4
show 0 90 4
you 0 90 4
that 0 90 4
it 1 90 4
is 1 90 4
time 1 90 4
to 1 90 4
take 1 90 4
our 1 90 4

back 1 90 4
from 1 90 4
the 1 90 4

In 0 90 5
recent 0 90 5

almost 0 90 5
every 0 90 5

one 0 90 5
of 0 90 5
them 0 90 5
had 0 90 5
stories 0 90 5
of 0 90 5
sexual 0 90 5

to 0 90 5
share… 0 90 5

CNN 0 90 6
spoke 0 90 6
with 0 90 6
more 0 90 6
than 0 90 6
50 0 90 6
lawmakers, 0 90 6
current 0 90 6

the 0 90 6
majority 0 90 6

to 0 90 6
be 0 90 6

and 0 90 6
avoid 0 90 6

With 0 90 7
few 0 90 7
exceptions, 0 90 7
every 0 90 7
person 0 90 7
said 0 90 7
they 0 90 7
have 0 90 7
personally 0 90 7
experienced 0 90 7
sexual 0 90 7
harassment 0 90 7
on 0 90 7
the 0 90 7
Hill 0 90 7
or 0 90 7
know 0 90 7
of 0 90 7
others 0 90 7
who 0 90 7
have. 0 90 7

In 0 90 8
an 0 90 8
environment 0 90 8
with 0 90 8
“so 0 90 8
many 0 90 8
young 0 90 8
women,” 0 90 8
said 0 90 8
one 0 90 8
ex-House 0 90 8
aide, 0 90 8
the 1 90 8
men 1 90 8
“have 1 90 8
no 1 90 8
self-control.” 1 90 8
“Amongst 0 90 8
ourselves, 0 90 8
we 0 90 8
know,” 0 90 8
a 0 90 8
former 0 90 8
Senate 0 90 8
staffer 0 90 8
said 0 90 8
of 0 90 8
the 0 90 8

with 0 90 8
the 0 90 8
worst 0 90 8
reputations. 0 90 8

And 0 90 9
sometimes, 0 90 9
the 0 90 9
sexual 0 90 9
advances 0 90 9
from 0 90 9
members 0 90 9
of 0 90 9
Congress 0 90 9
or 0 90 9
senior 0 90 9
aides 0 90 9
are 0 90 9
reciprocated 0 90 9
in 0 90 9
the 0 90 9
hopes 0 90 9
of 0 90 9
advancing 0 90 9
one’s 0 90 9
career 0 90 9
— 0 90 9
what 0 90 9
one 0 90 9
political 0 90 9
veteran 0 90 9
bluntly 0 90 9
referred 0 90 9
to 0 90 9

a 0 90 9
“sex 1 90 9
trade 1 90 9

The 1 90 10
American 1 90 10
people 1 90 10
are 1 90 10
not 1 90 10
going 1 90 10
to 1 90 10
put 1 90 10
up 1 90 10
with 1 90 10
this 1 90 10
any 1 90 10
longer. 1 90 10

We 1 90 11
have 1 90 11
no 1 90 11
choice 1 90 11
but 1 90 11
to 1 90 11
clean 1 90 11
up 1 90 11
our 1 90 11
government 1 90 11
because 1 90 11
the 1 90 11
rest 1 90 11
of 1 90 11
the 1 90 11
world 1 90 11
is 1 90 11
laughing 1 90 11
at 1 90 11
us. 1 90 11

On 0 90 12
Tuesday, 0 90 12
U.S. 0 90 12
Representative 0 90 12
Jackie 0 90 12
Speier 0 90 12
told 0 90 12
a 0 90 12
congressional 0 90 12
hearing 0 90 12
that 0 90 12
she 0 90 12
personally 0 90 12
knows 0 90 12
of 0 90 12
two 0 90 12
current 0 90 12
members 0 90 12
of 0 90 12
Congress 0 90 12
that 0 90 12
have 0 90 12
“engaged 0 90 12
in 0 90 12

harassment”… 0 90 12

“In 0 90 13
fact 0 90 13
there 0 90 13
are 0 90 13
two 0 90 13

right 0 90 13
now, 0 90 13
who 0 90 13

who 0 90 13
have…engaged 0 90 13
in 0 90 13

harassment.” 0 90 13
Speier 0 90 13
said 0 90 13
one 0 90 13
of 0 90 13
the 0 90 13
harassers 0 90 13
has 0 90 13
propositioned 0 90 13
women 0 90 13
with 0 90 13
the 0 90 13
comment, 0 90 13
“Are 1 90 13
you 1 90 13
going 1 90 13
to 1 90 13
be 1 90 13
a 1 90 13
good 1 90 13
girl?” 1 90 13
Another 0 90 13
has 1 90 13
exposed 1 90 13
his 1 90 13
genitals, 1 90 13
she 0 90 13
said, 0 90 13
and 0 90 13
some 0 90 13
victims 0 90 13
have 0 90 13
had 0 90 13
“their 1 90 13
private 1 90 13
parts 1 90 13
grabbed 1 90 13

“All 0 90 13

They 0 90 14
want 0 90 14
the 0 90 14

the 0 90 14

And 0 90 15
Speier 0 90 15
was 0 90 15
the 0 90 15
one 0 90 15
that 0 90 15

Here 0 90 28

the 0 90 30

it 0 90 30
was 0 90 30
a 0 90 30
young 0 90 30
woman 0 90 30
— 0 90 30
went 0 90 30
there 0 90 30

It 0 90 31
was 0 90 31
a 0 90 31

who 0 90 31
then 0 90 31
invited 0 90 31
her 0 90 31

And 0 90 32
at 0 90 32
that 0 90 32
point, 0 90 32
he 0 90 32

himself. 0 90 32

She 0 90 33

Of 0 90 35
course, 0 90 35
this 0 90 35
sort 0 90 35
of 0 90 35

in 0 90 36
“Weinstein-level” 1 90 36
predatory 1 90 36

An 0 90 37
ex-Secret 0 90 37

former 0 90 37

in 0 90 37
“Weinstein-level” 1 90 37
sexual 1 90 37
assault 1 90 37
and 0 90 37
that 0 90 37
he 0 90 37
would 0 90 37
walk 0 90 37
around 0 90 37
the 0 90 37
VP 0 90 37
residence 0 90 37
late 0 90 37
at 0 90 37
night 0 90 37
completely 1 90 37
naked. 1 90 37

According 0 90 38
to 0 90 38

who 0 90 38
spoke 0 90 38
on 0 90 38
condition 0 90 38
of 0 90 38
anonymity 0 90 38
revealed 0 90 38
that 0 90 38
Biden 0 90 38
“would 1 90 38
mess 1 90 38
with 1 90 38
every 1 90 38
single 1 90 38
woman 1 90 38
or 1 90 38
teen,” 1 90 38
and 0 90 38
that 0 90 38
a 0 90 38
Christmas 0 90 38
get-together 0 90 38
at 0 90 38
the 0 90 38
VP’s 0 90 38
house 0 90 38
had 0 90 38
to 0 90 38
be 0 90 38
canceled 0 90 38
“because 0 90 38
Biden 0 90 38

our 1 90 38
wives 1 90 38
and 1 90 38
girlfriend’s 1 90 38
asses.” 1 90 38

In 0 90 39
fact, 0 90 39
things 0 90 39
were 0 90 39
so 0 90 39
bad 0 90 39
that 0 90 39
at 0 90 39
one 0 90 39
point 0 90 39
a 0 90 39
Secret 0 90 39
Service 0 90 39
agent 0 90 39
almost 0 90 39
got 0 90 39
into 0 90 39
a 0 90 39
fight 0 90 39
with 0 90 39
Biden. 0 90 39

During 0 90 41
one 0 90 41
alleged 0 90 41
incident 0 90 41
in 0 90 41
2009, 0 90 41
Biden 0 90 41
cupped 0 90 41
the 0 90 41
breast 0 90 41
of 0 90 41
a 0 90 41

prompting 0 90 41
the 0 90 41

to 0 90 41

Biden 0 90 41
and 0 90 41
almost 0 90 41
hit 0 90 41
him. 0 90 41

The 0 90 42
agent 0 90 42
was 0 90 42
subsequently 0 90 42
suspended 0 90 42

a 0 90 42

according 0 90 42
to 0 90 42
the 0 90 42

Men 0 90 43

false 0 90 43

to 0 90 43

When 0 90 44

We 1 90 45

instead, 1 90 45
we 1 90 45
have 1 90 45
become 1 90 45
a 1 90 45

Those 1 90 46

we 1 90 46

in 0 91 8
what 0 91 8

Earlier 0 92 6
this 0 92 6
week, 0 92 6
I 0 92 6
wrote 0 92 6
an 0 92 6
article 0 92 6
about 0 92 6
how 0 92 6
“sexual 1 92 6
harassment 1 92 6
is 1 92 6
rampant 1 92 6
in 1 92 6
the 1 92 6

and 0 92 6
that 0 92 6
was 0 92 6
before 0 92 6
a 0 92 6
female 0 92 6
radio 0 92 6
anchor 0 92 6
named 0 92 6
LeeAnn 0 92 6

revealed 0 92 6
that 0 92 6
Al 0 92 6

had 0 92 6
“forcibly 0 92 6
kissed” 0 92 6

her 0 92 6
during 0 92 6
a 0 92 6

tour 0 92 6
in 0 92 6

The 0 92 7
following 0 92 7
comes 0 92 7
from 0 92 7
an 0 92 7
article 0 92 7
in 0 92 7
which 0 92 7
Tweeden 0 92 7
shared 0 92 7
her 0 92 7
story… 0 92 7

I 0 92 8
couldn’t 0 92 8
believe 0 92 8
it. 0 92 8

He 0 92 9
groped 0 92 9
me, 0 92 9
without 0 92 9
my 0 92 9
consent, 0 92 9
while 0 92 9
I 0 92 9
was 0 92 9
asleep. 0 92 9

I 1 92 10
felt 1 92 10
violated 1 92 10
all 1 92 10
over 1 92 10
again. 1 92 10

Embarrassed. 1 92 11

Belittled. 1 92 12

Humiliated. 1 92 13

How 0 92 14
dare 0 92 14
anyone 0 92 14
grab 0 92 14
my 0 92 14
breasts 0 92 14
like 0 92 14
this 0 92 14
and 0 92 14
think 0 92 14
it’s 0 92 14
funny? 0 92 14

I 0 92 15
told 0 92 15
my 0 92 15
husband 0 92 15
everything 0 92 15
that 0 92 15
happened 0 92 15
and 0 92 15
showed 0 92 15
him 0 92 15
the 0 92 15
picture. 0 92 15

I 0 92 16
wanted 0 92 16
to 0 92 16
shout 1 92 16
my 1 92 16
story 1 92 16
to 1 92 16
the 1 92 16
world 1 92 16
with 1 92 16
a 1 92 16
megaphone 1 92 16
to 0 92 16
anyone 0 92 16
who 0 92 16
would 0 92 16
listen, 0 92 16
but 0 92 16
even 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
angry 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
I 0 92 16
was, 0 92 16
I 0 92 16
was 0 92 16
worried 0 92 16
about 0 92 16
the 0 92 16
potential 0 92 16
backlash 0 92 16
and 0 92 16
damage 0 92 16
going 0 92 16
public 0 92 16
might 0 92 16
have 0 92 16
on 0 92 16
my 0 92 16
career 0 92 16
as 0 92 16
a 0 92 16
broadcaster. 0 92 16

But 0 92 17
that 0 92 17
was 0 92 17
then, 0 92 17
this 0 92 17
is 0 92 17
now. 0 92 17

I’m 1 92 18
no 1 92 18
longer 1 92 18
afraid. 1 92 18

When 0 92 19
the 0 92 19
story 0 92 19
initially 0 92 19
broke, 0 92 19
Franken 0 92 19
rushed 0 92 19
to 0 92 19
issue 0 92 19
an 0 92 19
apology… 0 92 19

“I 0 92 20
certainly 0 92 20
don’t 0 92 20
remember 0 92 20
the 0 92 20

the 0 92 20
skit 0 92 20
in 0 92 20
the 0 92 20
same 0 92 20
way, 0 92 20
but 0 92 20
I 0 92 20
send 0 92 20
my 0 92 20
sincerest 0 92 20
apologies 0 92 20
to 0 92 20

“As 0 92 21
to 0 92 21
the 0 92 21
photo, 0 92 21
it 0 92 21
was 0 92 21
clearly 0 92 21
intended 0 92 21
to 0 92 21
be 0 92 21
funny 0 92 21
but 0 92 21
wasn’t. 0 92 21

I 0 92 22
shouldn’t 0 92 22
have 0 92 22
done 0 92 22
it.” 0 92 22

Needless 0 92 23
to 0 92 23

many 0 92 23

in 0 92 28
which 0 92 28
Franken 0 92 28
has 0 92 28
acted 0 92 28
inappropriately. 0 92 28

And 0 92 29
of 0 92 29
course, 0 92 29
since 0 92 29
we 0 92 29
are 0 92 29
talking 0 92 29
about 0 92 29
Al 0 92 29
Franken, 0 92 29
it 0 92 29
wasn’t 0 92 29
exactly 0 92 29
difficult 0 92 29
to 0 92 29
find 0 92 29
material. 0 92 29

For 0 92 30
example, 0 92 30
a 0 92 30
photo 0 92 30

of 0 92 30
Franken 0 92 30
grabbing 0 92 30
Joy 0 92 30
Behar 0 92 30
in 0 92 30
a 0 92 30
very 1 92 30

manner. 1 92 30

The 0 92 31
following 0 92 31
comes 0 92 31
from 0 92 31
Breitbart… 0 92 31

comedian 0 92 32
Joy 0 92 32
Behar’s 0 92 32
breast 0 92 32
has 0 92 32
also 0 92 32
resurfaced. 0 92 32

Franken 0 92 33
was 0 92 33
a 0 92 33
comedian 0 92 33
before 0 92 33
he 0 92 33
ever 0 92 33
entered 0 92 33
the 0 92 33
world 0 92 33
of 0 92 33
politics, 0 92 33
and 0 92 33
we 0 92 33
understand 0 92 33
that. 0 92 33

But 0 92 34
just 0 92 34
because 0 92 34
he 0 92 34
was 0 92 34
a 0 92 34
comedian 0 92 34
does 0 92 34
not 0 92 34
mean 0 92 34
that 0 92 34
he 0 92 34
gets 0 92 34
to 0 92 34
play 0 92 34
by 0 92 34
a 0 92 34
different 0 92 34
set 0 92 34
of 0 92 34
rules. 0 92 34

There 0 92 35
appears 0 92 35
to 0 92 35
be 0 92 35
an 0 92 35
ongoing 0 92 35
pattern 0 92 35
of 0 92 35
behavior, 0 92 35
and 0 92 35
Fox 0 92 35

some 0 92 35
of 0 92 35
the 0 92 35
other 0 92 35

at 0 92 37
the 0 92 37
time 0 92 37
a 0 92 37
writer 0 92 37
for 0 92 37
“SNL,” 0 92 37
suggested 0 92 37
one 0 92 37
skit 0 92 37
should 0 92 37

out 0 92 37

was 0 92 40
quoted 0 92 40
saying. 0 92 40

The 0 92 41
article, 0 92 41
along 0 92 41
with 0 92 41
a 0 92 41
2000 0 92 41

talked 0 92 41
about 0 92 41
fantasizing 1 92 41
a 1 92 41
machine 1 92 41
would 1 92 41
perform 1 92 41
oral 1 92 41

on 1 92 41
him, 1 92 41

As 1 92 42
much 1 92 42
as 1 92 42
we 1 92 42
may 1 92 42
be 1 92 42
appalled 1 92 42
by 1 92 42
some 1 92 42
of 1 92 42
the 1 92 42
things 1 92 42
that 1 92 42

has 1 92 42
done, 1 92 42
the 1 92 42
truth 1 92 42
is 1 92 42
that 1 92 42
there 1 92 42
are 1 92 42

is 0 92 44
that 0 92 44
now 0 92 44

even 1 92 45
half 1 92 45

their 1 92 45
allegations 1 92 45
are 1 92 45
true 1 92 45

In 0 92 46
my 0 92 46
article 0 92 46
yesterday, 0 92 46
I 0 92 46
discussed 0 92 46
how 0 92 46
one 0 92 46
Secret 0 92 46
Service 0 92 46
agent 0 92 46
is 0 92 46
charging 0 92 46
former 0 92 46
Vice-President 0 92 46
Joe 0 92 46
Biden 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
engaging 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
“Weinstein-level” 1 92 46
behavior, 1 92 46
and 0 92 46
I 0 92 46
also 0 92 46
talked 0 92 46
about 0 92 46
how 0 92 46
15 0 92 46
million 0 92 46
dollars 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
settlements 0 92 46
have 0 92 46
been 0 92 46
secretly 0 92 46
paid 0 92 46
out 0 92 46
to 0 92 46
victims 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
sexual 0 92 46
harassment 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
the 0 92 46
House 0 92 46
of 0 92 46
Representatives 0 92 46
in 0 92 46
recent 0 92 46
years. 0 92 46

There 1 92 47
is 1 92 47
a 1 92 47
culture 1 92 47
of 1 92 47
corruption 1 92 47
in 1 92 47
Washington 1 92 47
D.C., 1 92 47
and 1 92 47
we 1 92 47
desperately 1 92 47
need 1 92 47
to 1 92 47
drain 1 92 47
the 1 92 47
swamp. 1 92 47

If 1 92 48
you 1 92 48
agree, 1 92 48
I 1 92 48
hope 1 92 48
that 1 92 48
you 1 92 48
will 1 92 48
support 1 92 48
my 1 92 48
campaign 1 92 48
and 1 92 48
the 1 92 48
campaigns 1 92 48
of 1 92 48
other 1 92 48
anti-establishment 1 92 48
candidates 1 92 48
that 1 92 48
want 1 92 48
to 1 92 48
clean 1 92 48
up 1 92 48
the 1 92 48
halls 1 92 48
of 1 92 48
Congress. 1 92 48

It 0 92 49
is 0 92 49
time 0 92 49
to 0 92 49
take 0 92 49
our 0 92 49

back 0 92 49
because 0 92 49
at 0 92 49
this 0 92 49
point 0 92 49
it 0 92 49
has 0 92 49
become 0 92 49
an 0 92 49
absolutely 1 92 49
disgusting 1 92 49
cesspool 1 92 49
of 1 92 49

An 0 94 2
expert 0 94 2
is 0 94 2
warning 1 94 2
the 1 94 2
plague 1 94 2
that 1 94 2
has 1 94 2
sickened 1 94 2
over 1 94 2
2000 1 94 2
people 1 94 2
in 1 94 2
Madagascar 1 94 2
since 1 94 2
August 1 94 2
is 1 94 2
impossible 1 94 2
to 1 94 2
eradicate. 1 94 2

Even 0 94 3
though 0 94 3
the 0 94 3
number 0 94 3
of 0 94 3
those 0 94 3
infected 0 94 3
has 0 94 3
dropped 0 94 3
in 0 94 3
recent 0 94 3
weeks, 0 94 3
the 1 94 3
plague 1 94 3
will 1 94 3
never 1 94 3
truly 1 94 3
be 1 94 3
gone. 1 94 3

Since 0 94 4
the 0 94 4
airborne 0 94 4
version 0 94 4
of 0 94 4
the 0 94 4
plague 0 94 4
can 0 94 4
kill 0 94 4
a 0 94 4
person 0 94 4
in 0 94 4
just 0 94 4
three 0 94 4
hours, 0 94 4
experts 0 94 4
warn 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
its 0 94 4
too 0 94 4
soon 0 94 4
to 0 94 4
think 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
since 0 94 4
there 0 94 4
hasn’t 0 94 4
been 0 94 4
a 0 94 4
person 0 94 4
infected 0 94 4
in 0 94 4
recent 0 94 4
days, 0 94 4
that 0 94 4
it 0 94 4
won’t 0 94 4
pop 0 94 4
up 0 94 4
again. 0 94 4

That’s 0 94 5
because 0 94 5
the 1 94 5
bacteria 1 94 5
that 1 94 5
causes 1 94 5
plague 1 94 5
is 1 94 5
now 1 94 5
so 1 94 5
widespread 1 94 5
in 1 94 5
wildlife, 1 94 5
that 1 94 5
humans 1 94 5
can’t 1 94 5
do 1 94 5
anything 1 94 5
to 1 94 5
get 1 94 5
rid 1 94 5
of 1 94 5
it, 1 94 5

must 0 96 2

most 0 96 2
annoying 1 96 2
for 0 96 2
the 0 96 2
Clinton 0 96 2

is 0 96 2
that 0 96 2
these 0 96 2
investigations 0 96 2
all 0 96 2
started 0 96 2
as 0 96 2
a 0 96 2
way 0 96 2
to 0 96 2
undermine 0 96 2
the 0 96 2

than 0 96 3
a 0 96 3
year 0 96 3
after 0 96 3
the 0 96 3

began, 0 96 3
it’s 0 96 3
looking 0 96 3
less 0 96 3
likely 0 96 3
than 0 96 3
ever 0 96 3
that 0 96 3
President 0 96 3

did 0 96 3
anything 0 96 3
wrong… 0 96 3
but 0 96 3
the 0 96 3
investigations 0 96 3
seem 0 96 3
to 0 96 3
be 0 96 3
zeroing 0 96 3

that 0 96 26
uranium 0 96 26
one 0 96 26
was 0 96 26
part 0 96 26
of 0 96 26
a 0 96 26
Russia 0 96 26
strategy 0 96 26
to 0 96 26
control, 1 96 26
not 0 96 26
just 0 96 26
benefit 0 96 26
from 0 96 26
the 0 96 26
global 0 96 26
market, 0 96 26
controlled 1 96 26
the 0 96 26
global 0 96 26
market. 0 96 26

That 0 96 27
would 0 96 27
put 0 96 27
the 0 96 27
United 0 96 27
States 0 96 27
at 0 96 27
a 0 96 27
disadvantage. 0 96 27

That 0 96 28
is 0 96 28
the 0 96 28
sort 0 96 28
of 0 96 28
evidence 0 96 28
that 0 96 28
this 0 96 28
FBI 0 96 28
informant 0 96 28
has 0 96 28
right 0 96 28
now. 0 96 28

If 0 96 29
you 0 96 29
go 0 96 29
back 0 96 29
on 0 96 29
the 0 96 29
last 0 96 29
week 0 96 29
we 0 96 29
heard 0 96 29
several 0 96 29
things 0 96 29
from 0 96 29
the 0 96 29
Justice 0 96 29
Department, 0 96 29
there’s 0 96 29
no 0 96 29
connection 0 96 29
to 0 96 29
uranium 0 96 29
one. 0 96 29

These 0 96 30
are 0 96 30
emails 0 96 30
that 0 96 30
say 0 96 30
uranium 0 96 30
one 0 96 30
that 0 96 30
are 0 96 30
in 0 96 30
the 0 96 30
FBI 0 96 30
files. 0 96 30

They 0 96 31
said 0 96 31
that 0 96 31
there 0 96 31
was 0 96 31
no 0 96 31
connection 0 96 31
between 0 96 31
the 0 96 31
uranium 0 96 31
one 0 96 31
case 0 96 31
and 0 96 31
the 0 96 31
criminal 0 96 31
case. 0 96 31

We 0 96 32
now 0 96 32
know 0 96 32
the 0 96 32
criminal 0 96 32
case 0 96 32
got 0 96 32
its 0 96 32
first 0 96 32
evidence 0 96 32
in 0 96 32
2009, 0 96 32
a 0 96 32
whole 0 96 32
year 0 96 32
before 0 96 32
the 0 96 32
uranium 0 96 32
one 0 96 32
deal 0 96 32
was 0 96 32
approved 0 96 32
by 0 96 32
the 0 96 32
Obama 0 96 32
administration. 0 96 32

There 0 96 33
are 0 96 33
a 0 96 33
lot 0 96 33
of 0 96 33
things 0 96 33
that 0 96 33
people 0 96 33
have 0 96 33
been 0 96 33
saying 0 96 33
that 0 96 33
these 0 96 33
documents 0 96 33
simply 0 96 33
don’t 0 96 33
agree 0 96 33
with. 0 96 33

HANNITY: 0 96 34
All 0 96 34
right. 0 96 34

I 0 96 35
got 0 96 35
a 0 96 35
very 0 96 35
high 0 96 35
ranking 0 96 35
Congressman 0 96 35
and 0 96 35
that 0 96 35
knows, 0 96 35
let 0 96 35
us 0 96 35
put 0 96 35
it 0 96 35
that 0 96 35
way, 0 96 35
and 0 96 35
actually 0 96 35
sent 0 96 35
me 0 96 35
a 0 96 35
note. 0 96 35

The 0 96 36
knowledge 0 96 36
of 0 96 36
key 0 96 36
administration 0 96 36
officials 0 96 36
will 0 96 36
be 0 96 36
the 0 96 36
next 0 96 36
thing 0 96 36
proven 0 96 36
by 0 96 36
both 0 96 36
of 0 96 36
you, 0 96 36
and 0 96 36
the 0 96 36
links 0 96 36
to 0 96 36
the 0 96 36
Clinton 0 96 36
foundation. 0 96 36

Sara, 0 96 37
is 0 96 37
that 0 96 37
true? 0 96 37

CARTER: 0 96 38
I 0 96 38
believe 0 96 38
that 0 96 38
is 0 96 38
true. 0 96 38

I 0 96 39
mean 0 96 39
especially 0 96 39
when 0 96 39
we 0 96 39
at 0 96 39
— 0 96 39

HANNITY: 0 96 40
Do 0 96 40
believe 0 96 40
or 0 96 40
you 0 96 40
know? 0 96 40

I 0 96 41
can’t 0 96 41
ask 0 96 41
Victoria 0 96 41
that 0 96 41
question 0 96 41
because 0 96 41
she 0 96 41
won’t 0 96 41
tell 0 96 41
me. 0 96 41

CARTER: 0 96 42
I 0 96 42
know 0 96 42
it’s 0 96 42
true. 0 96 42

I 0 96 43
know 0 96 43
that 0 96 43
looking 0 96 43
at 0 96 43
these 0 96 43
documents 0 96 43
following 0 96 43
the 0 96 43
money, 0 96 43
following 0 96 43
the 0 96 43
money 0 96 43
is 0 96 43
what’s 0 96 43
important 0 96 43
here. 0 96 43

The 0 96 44
Justice 0 96 44
Department 0 96 44
has 0 96 44
not 0 96 44
pointed 0 96 44
out 0 96 44
that 0 96 44
they 0 96 44
will 0 96 44
possibly 0 96 44
call 0 96 44
a 0 96 44
special 0 96 44
counsel 0 96 44
to 0 96 44
this. 0 96 44

This 0 96 45
is 0 96 45
still 0 96 45
out 0 96 45
there. 0 96 45

They 0 96 46
are 0 96 46
looking 0 96 46
into 0 96 46
it. 0 96 46

That 0 96 47
is 0 96 47
something 0 96 47
that 0 96 47
they 0 96 47
need 0 96 47
to 0 96 47
decide. 0 96 47

But 0 96 48
whether 0 96 48
it’s 0 96 48
a 0 96 48
special 0 96 48
counsel 0 96 48
or 0 96 48
whether 0 96 48
it’s 0 96 48
a 0 96 48
prosecutor 0 96 48
that 0 96 48
is 0 96 48
investigating 0 96 48
this, 0 96 48
they 0 96 48
will 0 96 48
be 0 96 48
able 0 96 48
to 0 96 48
follow 0 96 48
the 0 96 48
money. 0 96 48

There 0 96 49
are 0 96 49
somethings 0 96 49
said 0 96 49
… 0 96 49

HANNITY: 0 96 50
When 0 96 50
you 0 96 50
say 0 96 50
follow 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
money, 0 96 50
my 0 96 50
suspicion 0 96 50
would 0 96 50
go 0 96 50
to 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
money 0 96 50
came 0 96 50
directly 0 96 50
from 0 96 50
Russia, 0 96 50
was 0 96 50
funneled 0 96 50
through 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
Canadian 0 96 50
donors 0 96 50
to 0 96 50
the 0 96 50
Clinton 0 96 50
Foundation. 0 96 50

How 0 96 51
good 0 96 51
are 0 96 51
my 0 96 51
instincts? 0 96 51

CARTER: 0 96 52
You 0 96 52
have 0 96 52
pretty 0 96 52
good 0 96 52
instincts. 0 96 52

I 0 96 53
think 0 96 53
there’s 0 96 53
a 0 96 53
lot 0 96 53
of 0 96 53
other 0 96 53
areas 0 96 53
that 0 96 53
they 0 96 53
will 0 96 53
be 0 96 53
looking 0 96 53
at 0 96 53
as 0 96 53
well. 0 96 53

Remember 0 96 54
this 0 96 54
is 0 96 54
like 0 96 54
peeling 0 96 54
back 0 96 54
an 0 96 54
onion. 0 96 54

You 0 96 55
peel 0 96 55
one 0 96 55
part 0 96 55
and 0 96 55
then 0 96 55
you 0 96 55
find 0 96 55
another 0 96 55
part. 0 96 55

And 0 96 56
that 0 96 56
is 0 96 56
what’s 0 96 56
going 0 96 56
to 0 96 56
require 0 96 56
somebody 0 96 56
to 0 96 56
do 0 96 56
an 0 96 56
extensive 0 96 56
investigation. 0 96 56

HANNITY: 0 96 57
But 0 96 57
it 0 96 57
is 0 96 57
beginning 0 96 57
to 0 96 57
cascade 0 96 57
Sara. 0 96 57

CARTER: 0 96 58
It 0 96 58
is. 0 96 58

HANNITY: 0 96 59
John, 0 96 59
I 0 96 59
want 0 96 59
her 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
respond 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
same 0 96 59
thing, 0 96 59
that 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
Clinton 0 96 59
Foundation, 0 96 59
that 0 96 59
this 0 96 59
will 0 96 59
be 0 96 59
traced 0 96 59
back 0 96 59
to 0 96 59
high-ranking 0 96 59
Obama 0 96 59
administration 0 96 59
officials 0 96 59
and 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
Clinton 0 96 59
Foundation, 0 96 59
and 0 96 59
if 0 96 59
you 0 96 59
add 0 96 59
the 0 96 59
money 0 96 59
portion 0 96 59
Sara 0 96 59
mentioned? 0 96 59

SOLOMON: 0 96 60
I 0 96 60
do. 0 96 60

I 0 96 61
think 0 96 61
the 0 96 61
place 0 96 61
we 0 96 61
will 0 96 61
be 0 96 61
talking 0 96 61
about 0 96 61
in 0 96 61
the 0 96 61
next 0 96 61
couple 0 96 61
weeks 0 96 61
as 0 96 61
the 0 96 61
Clinton 0 96 61
global 0 96 61
initiative. 0 96 61

Sort 0 96 62
of 0 96 62
a 0 96 62
side 0 96 62
project 0 96 62
of 0 96 62
the 0 96 62
Clinton 0 96 62
Foundation. 0 96 62

There 0 96 63
are 0 96 63
new 0 96 63
flows 0 96 63
of 0 96 63
money 0 96 63
there 0 96 63
that 0 96 63
we 0 96 63
will 0 96 63
report 0 96 63
on 0 96 63
then 0 96 63
the 0 96 63
next 0 96 63
couple 0 96 63
of 0 96 63
weeks. 0 96 63

There 0 96 64
were 0 96 64
also 0 96 64
some 0 96 64
personal 0 96 64
business 0 96 64
projects, 0 96 64
some 0 96 64
very 0 96 64
senior 0 96 64
Clinton 0 96 64
people 0 96 64
that 0 96 64
got 0 96 64
a 0 96 64
remarkable 1 96 64
infusion 0 96 64
of 0 96 64
cash 0 96 64
from 0 96 64
Russia. 0 96 64

It 0 96 65
will 0 96 65
be 0 96 65
able 0 96 65
to 0 96 65
talk 0 96 65
about 0 96 65
that 0 96 65
in 0 96 65
the 0 96 65
next 0 96 65
couple 0 96 65
of 0 96 65
weeks. 0 96 65

Another 0 96 66
layer 0 96 66
of 0 96 66
interest 0 96 66
of 0 96 66
the 0 96 66
story. 0 96 66

HANNITY: 0 96 67
All 0 96 67
right. 0 96 67

We 0 96 68
have 0 96 68
a 0 96 68
lot 0 96 68
of 0 96 68
time 0 96 68
in 0 96 68
the 0 96 68
segment 0 96 68
so 0 96 68
I 0 96 68
want 0 96 68
to 0 96 68
go 0 96 68
very 0 96 68
slowly 0 96 68
here. 0 96 68

Both 0 96 69
of 0 96 69
you, 0 96 69
before 0 96 69
I 0 96 69
get 0 96 69
to 0 96 69
Victoria, 0 96 69
Sara 0 96 69
and 0 96 69
John, 0 96 69
you 0 96 69
both 0 96 69
in 0 96 69
your 0 96 69
pieces 0 96 69
said 0 96 69
5,000 0 96 69
documents. 0 96 69

I 0 96 70
hear 0 96 70
the 0 96 70
number 0 96 70
the 0 96 70
FBI 0 96 70
informant 0 96 70
is 0 96 70
much, 0 96 70
much 0 96 70
greater, 0 96 70
tens 0 96 70
of 0 96 70
thousands. 0 96 70

True 0 96 71
or 0 96 71
false? 0 96 71

SOLOMON: 0 96 72
That 0 96 72
seems 0 96 72
to 0 96 72
be 0 96 72
accurate. 0 96 72

We 0 96 73
have 0 96 73
a 0 96 73
subset 0 96 73
of 0 96 73
the 0 96 73
documents 0 96 73
and 0 96 73
they 0 96 73
are 0 96 73
very 0 96 73
voluminous. 0 96 73

HANNITY: 0 96 74
Now 0 96 74
let 0 96 74
me 0 96 74
go 0 96 74
to 0 96 74
Victoria. 0 96 74

One 0 96 75
of 0 96 75
the 0 96 75
great 0 96 75
attorneys. 0 96 75

She 0 96 76
is 0 96 76
the 0 96 76
most 0 96 76
difficult 0 96 76
to 0 96 76
get 0 96 76
any 0 96 76
information 0 96 76
out 0 96 76
of. 0 96 76

Victoria, 0 96 77
one 0 96 77
of 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
things 0 96 77
I’ve 0 96 77
known 0 96 77
about 0 96 77
you, 0 96 77
and 0 96 77
I’ve 0 96 77
interviewed 0 96 77
you 0 96 77
so 0 96 77
many 0 96 77
times 0 96 77
over 0 96 77
the 0 96 77
years, 0 96 77
you 0 96 77
now 0 96 77
have 0 96 77
been 0 96 77
doing 0 96 77
a 0 96 77
deep 0 96 77
dive 0 96 77
into 0 96 77
all 0 96 77
of 0 96 77
this. 0 96 77

You 0 96 78
are 0 96 78
now 0 96 78
representing 0 96 78
this 0 96 78
FBI 0 96 78
informant. 0 96 78

I 0 96 79
think 0 96 79
they 0 96 79
will 0 96 79
become 0 96 79
an 0 96 79
American 1 96 79
hero 1 96 79
out 0 96 79
of 0 96 79
all 0 96 79
of 0 96 79
this, 0 96 79
but 0 96 79
apparently, 0 96 79
he 0 96 79
was 0 96 79
fighting 0 96 79
and 0 96 79
begging 0 96 79
and 0 96 79
pleading 0 96 79
and 0 96 79
saying 0 96 79
the 0 96 79
Russians 0 96 79
are 0 96 79
here, 0 96 79
they 0 96 79
are 0 96 79
doing 0 96 79
this, 0 96 79
why 0 96 79
are 0 96 79
you 0 96 79
paying 0 96 79
attention? 0 96 79

I 0 96 80
hope 0 96 80
my 0 96 80
instincts 0 96 80
are 0 96 80
right 0 96 80
there, 0 96 80
and 0 96 80
number 0 96 80
two, 0 96 80
how 0 96 80
devastating 1 96 80
it 0 96 80
legally 0 96 80
is 0 96 80
this 0 96 80
going 0 96 80
to 0 96 80
be 0 96 80
based 0 96 80
on 0 96 80
what 0 96 80
I 0 96 80
was 0 96 80
just 0 96 80
asking 0 96 80
Sara 0 96 80
and 0 96 80
John 0 96 80
about 0 96 80
impacting 0 96 80
former 0 96 80

VICTORIA 0 96 81
TOENSING, 0 96 81
ATTORNEY 0 96 81
REPRESENTING 0 96 81
FBI 0 96 81
INFORMANT: 0 96 81
Let 0 96 81
me 0 96 81
go 0 96 81
to 0 96 81
number 0 96 81
one 0 96 81
first, 0 96 81
that 0 96 81
is 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
whole 0 96 81
essence 0 96 81
of 0 96 81
what 0 96 81
John 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
Sara 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
I 0 96 81
are 0 96 81
talking 0 96 81
about 0 96 81
is 0 96 81
that 0 96 81
in 0 96 81
2009, 0 96 81
2010, 0 96 81
our 0 96 81
FBI 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
presumably 0 96 81
our 0 96 81
Justice 0 96 81
Department, 0 96 81
and 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
White 0 96 81
House, 0 96 81
as 0 96 81
my 0 96 81
client 0 96 81
was 0 96 81
told, 0 96 81
all 0 96 81
knew 0 96 81
about 0 96 81
this 0 96 81
corruption 0 96 81
in 0 96 81
the 0 96 81
Russian 0 96 81
nuclear 0 96 81
energy 0 96 81
area. 0 96 81

There’s 0 96 82
no 0 96 82
separate 0 96 82
companies. 0 96 82

They 0 96 83
are 0 96 83
all 0 96 83
related. 0 96 83

The 0 96 84
Russian 0 96 84
nuclear 0 96 84
energy 0 96 84
is 0 96 84
controlled 1 96 84
from 0 96 84
the 0 96 84
top, 0 96 84
from 0 96 84
Putin. 0 96 84

They 0 96 85
are 0 96 85
all 0 96 85
one. 0 96 85

They 0 96 86
all 0 96 86
talk 0 96 86
to 0 96 86
each 0 96 86
other. 0 96 86

So 0 96 87
the 0 96 87
evidence 0 96 87
about 0 96 87
this 0 96 87
corruption 0 96 87
was 0 96 87
known 0 96 87
to 0 96 87
our 0 96 87
government 0 96 87
in 0 96 87
2009, 0 96 87
2010, 0 96 87
and 0 96 87
why 0 96 87
is 0 96 87
it 0 96 87
that 0 96 87
CFIUS 0 96 87
either 0 96 87
wasn’t 0 96 87
told, 0 96 87
or 0 96 87
CFIUS 0 96 87
people 0 96 87
knowing 0 96 87
about 0 96 87
it 0 96 87
— 0 96 87

HANNITY: 0 96 88
Explain 0 96 88
CFIUS, 0 96 88
13 0 96 88
agencies, 0 96 88
I 0 96 88
am 0 96 88
sorry 0 96 88
9 0 96 88
agencies 0 96 88
approving 0 96 88
the 0 96 88
deal 0 96 88
that 0 96 88
gave 0 96 88
control 1 96 88
of 0 96 88
uranium 0 96 88
one 0 96 88
to 0 96 88
the 0 96 88
bad 1 96 88
actor, 1 96 88
hostile 1 96 88
regime, 1 96 88
Putin 0 96 88
Russia. 0 96 88

TOENSING: 0 96 89
They 0 96 89
said, 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
CFIUS 0 96 89
board 0 96 89
said 0 96 89
that 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
bad 1 96 89
Russians 0 96 89
could 0 96 89
buy 0 96 89
uranium 0 96 89
one, 0 96 89
which 0 96 89
contains 0 96 89
access 0 96 89
to 0 96 89
20 0 96 89
percent 0 96 89
of 0 96 89
the 0 96 89
U.S. 0 96 89

Uranium, 0 96 90
why 0 96 90
was 0 96 90
that 0 96 90
decision 0 96 90
made? 0 96 90

Was 0 96 91
CFIUS 0 96 91
told? 0 96 91

Did 0 96 92
Bob 0 96 92

go 0 96 92
to 0 96 92
Eric 0 96 92

and 0 96 92
tell 0 96 92
him? 0 96 92

Eric 0 96 93
Holder 0 96 93
sat 0 96 93
on 0 96 93
it. 0 96 93

HANNITY: 0 96 94
He 0 96 94
was 0 96 94
one 0 96 94
of 0 96 94
the 0 96 94
nine. 0 96 94

TOENSING: 0 96 95
Did 0 96 95
Bob 0 96 95
Mueller 0 96 95
go 0 96 95
to 0 96 95
the 0 96 95
White 0 96 95
House 0 96 95
and 0 96 95
tell 0 96 95
him? 0 96 95

The 0 96 96
FBI 0 96 96
agents 0 96 96
told 0 96 96
my 0 96 96
client 0 96 96
that 0 96 96
they 0 96 96
were 0 96 96
briefing 0 96 96
the 0 96 96
President 0 96 96
about 0 96 96
his 0 96 96
conduct. 0 96 96

Of 0 96 97
course, 0 96 97
when 0 96 97
the 0 96 97
CFIUS 0 96 97
decision 0 96 97
was 0 96 97
made. 0 96 97

My 0 96 98
client 0 96 98
said, 0 96 98
what 0 96 98
happened? 0 96 98

HANNITY: 0 96 99
Back 0 96 99
to 0 96 99
my 0 96 99
original 0 96 99
question, 0 96 99
counselor, 0 96 99
if 0 96 99
I 0 96 99
may. 0 96 99

You 0 96 100
are 0 96 100
too 0 96 100
good 0 96 100
at 0 96 100
your 0 96 100
job. 0 96 100

This 0 96 101
is 0 96 101
a 0 96 101
very 0 96 101
serious 0 96 101
point. 0 96 101

Putting 0 96 102
your 0 96 102
legal 0 96 102
hat 0 96 102
on, 0 96 102
objectively 0 96 102
speaking, 0 96 102
yes 0 96 102
they 0 96 102
knew, 0 96 102
the 0 96 102
evidence 0 96 102
will 0 96 102
prove 0 96 102
it 0 96 102
based 0 96 102
on 0 96 102
the 0 96 102
documents 0 96 102
and 0 96 102
your 0 96 102
client, 0 96 102
crimes 0 96 102
committed 0 96 102
on 0 96 102
a 0 96 102
high 0 96 102
level? 0 96 102

National 0 96 103
security 0 96 103
compromise? 0 96 103

TOENSING: 0 96 104
Of 0 96 104
course, 0 96 104
it 0 96 104
goes 0 96 104
without 0 96 104
saying 0 96 104
giving 0 96 104
the 0 96 104
Russians 0 96 104
control 1 96 104
of 0 96 104
the 0 96 104
uranium 0 96 104
was 0 96 104
a 0 96 104
national 0 96 104
security 0 96 104
compromise. 0 96 104

I 0 96 105
think 0 96 105
that 0 96 105
we 0 96 105
are 0 96 105
going 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
have 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
do 0 96 105
is 0 96 105
continue 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
follow 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
money 0 96 105
because 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
reporting 0 96 105
that 0 96 105
John 0 96 105
and 0 96 105
Sara 0 96 105
are 0 96 105
going 0 96 105
to 0 96 105
be 0 96 105
doing 0 96 105
in 0 96 105
a 0 96 105
few 0 96 105
days 0 96 105
will 0 96 105
be 0 96 105
revealing 0 96 105
about 0 96 105
where 0 96 105
lots 0 96 105
of 0 96 105
the 0 96 105
various 0 96 105
money 0 96 105
went 0 96 105
and 0 96 105
where 0 96 105
it 0 96 105
came 0 96 105
from. 0 96 105

HANNITY: 0 96 106
Always 0 96 106
we 0 96 106
go 0 96 106
back, 0 96 106
and 0 96 106
I 0 96 106
believe 0 96 106
at 0 96 106
the 0 96 106
end 0 96 106
of 0 96 106
this 0 96 106
you 0 96 106
guys 0 96 106
deserve 0 96 106
a 0 96 106
Pulitzer, 0 96 106
and 0 96 106
I’m 0 96 106
not 0 96 106
the 0 96 106
only 0 96 106
one 0 96 106
thinking 0 96 106
that. 0 96 106

You 0 96 107
have 0 96 107
dug 0 96 107
so 0 96 107
deep 0 96 107
on 0 96 107
this, 0 96 107
this 0 96 107
has 0 96 107
been 0 96 107
a 0 96 107
deep 0 96 107
dive 0 96 107
and 0 96 107
I 0 96 107
applaud 0 96 107
you 0 96 107
both. 0 96 107

I 0 96 108
want 0 96 108
to 0 96 108
ask 0 96 108
as 0 96 108
it 0 96 108
relates 0 96 108
to 0 96 108
who 0 96 108
knew 0 96 108
what, 0 96 108
and 0 96 108
when. 0 96 108

What 0 96 109
did 0 96 109
they 0 96 109
know, 0 96 109
when 0 96 109
did 0 96 109
they 0 96 109
know 0 96 109
it, 0 96 109
John 0 96 109
Solomon? 0 96 109

I’m 0 96 110
talking 0 96 110
about 0 96 110
Obama, 0 96 110
Mueller, 0 96 110
Eric 0 96 110
Holder, 0 96 110
and 0 96 110
Hillary 0 96 110
Clinton. 0 96 110

SOLOMON: 0 96 111
We 0 96 111
are 0 96 111
at 0 96 111
a 0 96 111
little 0 96 111
disadvantage 0 96 111
right 0 96 111
now, 0 96 111
because 0 96 111
we 0 96 111
don’t 0 96 111
have 0 96 111
those 0 96 111
records, 0 96 111
and 0 96 111
also 0 96 111
the 0 96 111
records 0 96 111
that 0 96 111
Congress 0 96 111
needs 0 96 111
to 0 96 111
go 0 96 111
get, 0 96 111
but 0 96 111
I 0 96 111
can 0 96 111
tell 0 96 111
you 0 96 111
I 0 96 111
have 0 96 111
a 0 96 111
person 0 96 111
quoted 0 96 111
in 0 96 111
my 0 96 111
story 0 96 111
who 0 96 111
has 0 96 111
direct 0 96 111
knowledge 0 96 111
of 0 96 111
what 0 96 111
the 0 96 111
Justice 0 96 111
Department 0 96 111
knew. 0 96 111

This 0 96 112
person 0 96 112
said 0 96 112
without 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
shred 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
doubt, 1 96 112
we 0 96 112
knew 0 96 112
in 0 96 112
2009 0 96 112
a 0 96 112
year 0 96 112
before 0 96 112
CFIUS 0 96 112
ruled 0 96 112
that 0 96 112
Thomas 0 96 112
were 0 96 112
engaged 0 96 112
in 0 96 112
criminality, 0 96 112
without 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
shadow 1 96 112
of 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
doubt, 1 96 112
we 0 96 112
knew 0 96 112
that 0 96 112
Russia 0 96 112
was 0 96 112
trying 0 96 112
to 0 96 112
gain 0 96 112
a 0 96 112
corner 0 96 112
on 0 96 112
the 0 96 112
U.S. 0 96 112
market, 0 96 112
get 0 96 112
a 0 96 112
strong 0 96 112
hold 0 96 112
on 0 96 112
our 0 96 112
uranium, 0 96 112
and 0 96 112
without 1 96 112
a 1 96 112
doubt 1 96 112
we 0 96 112
knew 0 96 112
they 0 96 112
were 0 96 112
using 0 96 112
political 0 96 112
levers 0 96 112
to 0 96 112
try 0 96 112
to 0 96 112
get 0 96 112
their 0 96 112
way 0 96 112
here. 0 96 112

We 0 96 113
are 0 96 113
talking 0 96 113
about 0 96 113
control, 1 96 113
like 0 96 113
this 0 96 113
document 0 96 113
says, 0 96 113
they 0 96 113
are 0 96 113
trying 0 96 113
to 0 96 113
gain 0 96 113
control 1 96 113
of 0 96 113
our 0 96 113
markets. 0 96 113

That 0 96 114
has 0 96 114
to 0 96 114
be 0 96 114
national 1 96 114
security 1 96 114
interest 0 96 114
that 0 96 114
should 0 96 114
have 0 96 114
been 0 96 114
raised 0 96 114
in 0 96 114
CFIUS. 0 96 114

HANNITY: 0 96 115
President 0 96 115
daily 0 96 115
briefings 0 96 115
were 0 96 115
told. 0 96 115

Had 0 96 116
this 0 96 116
information 0 96 116
in 0 96 116
it 0 96 116
before 0 96 116
CFIUS 0 96 116
approves 0 96 116
this. 0 96 116

CARTER: 0 96 117
Sean. 0 96 117

That 0 96 118
is 0 96 118
what 0 96 118
we 0 96 118
need 0 96 118
to 0 96 118
find 0 96 118
out. 0 96 118

We 0 96 119
need 0 96 119
to 0 96 119
see 0 96 119
those 0 96 119
Presidential 0 96 119
daily 0 96 119
briefings. 0 96 119

Congress 0 96 120
can 0 96 120
get 0 96 120
those. 0 96 120

They 0 96 121
will 0 96 121
be 0 96 121
able 0 96 121
to 0 96 121
know 0 96 121
whether 0 96 121
or 0 96 121
not 0 96 121
President 0 96 121
Obama 0 96 121
was 0 96 121
briefed 0 96 121
on 0 96 121
this 0 96 121
and 0 96 121
according 0 96 121
to 0 96 121
a 0 96 121
number 0 96 121
of 0 96 121
people 0 96 121
that 0 96 121
I 0 96 121
have 0 96 121
spoken 0 96 121
with 0 96 121
as 0 96 121
well, 0 96 121
he 0 96 121
was. 0 96 121

I 0 96 122
think 0 96 122
that 0 96 122
will 0 96 122
reveal 0 96 122
a 0 96 122
whole 0 96 122
other 0 96 122
layer 0 96 122
of 0 96 122
who 0 96 122
knew 0 96 122
what, 0 96 122
where 0 96 122
and 0 96 122

The 0 96 133

The 0 98 9
main 0 98 9
difference 0 98 9
between 0 98 9
asteroids 0 98 9
and 0 98 9
comets 0 98 9
is 0 98 9
their 0 98 9
composition. 0 98 9

Asteroids 0 98 10
are 0 98 10
made 0 98 10
up 0 98 10
of 0 98 10
metals 0 98 10
and 0 98 10
rocky 0 98 10
material, 0 98 10
while 0 98 10
comets 0 98 10
are 0 98 10
made 0 98 10
up 0 98 10
of 0 98 10
ice, 0 98 10
dust 0 98 10
and 0 98 10
rocky 0 98 10
material. 0 98 10

Comets 0 98 11
which 0 98 11
approach 0 98 11
the 0 98 11
Sun 0 98 11
lose 0 98 11
material 0 98 11
with 0 98 11
each 0 98 11
orbit 0 98 11
because 0 98 11
some 0 98 11
of 0 98 11
their 0 98 11
ice 0 98 11
melts 0 98 11
and 0 98 11
vaporizes 0 98 11
to 0 98 11
form 0 98 11
a 0 98 11
tail. 0 98 11

But 0 98 12
the 0 98 12
real 0 98 12
question 0 98 12
is 0 98 12
will 0 98 12
anyone 0 98 12
be 0 98 12
able 0 98 12
to 0 98 12
see 0 98 12
the 0 98 12
asteroid’s 0 98 12
close 0 98 12
approach 0 98 12
to 0 98 12
our 0 98 12
planet. 0 98 12

According 0 98 13
to 0 98 13
NASA, 0 98 13
3200 0 98 13
Phaethon 0 98 13
will 0 98 13
be 0 98 13
visible 0 98 13
in 0 98 13
small 0 98 13
telescopes 0 98 13
for 0 98 13
experienced 0 98 13
observers 0 98 13
in 0 98 13
areas 0 98 13
with 0 98 13
dark 0 98 13
skies. 0 98 13

It 0 98 14
is 0 98 14
potentially 0 98 14
detectable 0 98 14
for 0 98 14
three 0 98 14
weeks 0 98 14
but 0 98 14
will 0 98 14
be 0 98 14
at 0 98 14
its 0 98 14
brightest 0 98 14

that 0 99 32
happen, 0 99 32

the 0 99 35

Mr. 0 100 9

Zarate 0 100 9

by 0 100 10
federal 0 100 10

The 1 100 11

fed 0 100 12
into 0 100 12
a 0 100 12

over 0 100 12
whether 0 100 12

Mr. 0 100 14

Zarate 0 100 14
acknowledged 0 100 14
firing 0 100 14
the 0 100 14

said 0 100 14
it 0 100 14

Zarate 0 100 15
and 0 100 15
his 0 100 15
defense 0 100 15
team 0 100 15
maintained 0 100 15
the 0 100 15
argument 0 100 15
that 0 100 15
the 0 100 15
suspect 0 100 15
found 0 100 15
the 0 100 15
stolen 0 100 15

on 0 100 15
the 0 100 15
pier 0 100 15

day 0 100 15
and 0 100 15
it 0 100 15
“just 1 100 15
fired.” 1 100 15
The 0 100 15
gun 0 100 15
belonged 0 100 15
to 0 100 15
a 0 100 15

The 0 100 16
bullet 0 100 16
ricocheted 0 100 16
on 0 100 16
the 0 100 16
pier’s 0 100 16
concrete 0 100 16
walkway 0 100 16

struck 0 100 16
Steinle, 0 100 16
killing 0 100 16
her. 0 100 16

Zarate 0 100 17
has 0 100 17
admitted 0 100 17
to 0 100 17
shooting 0 100 17
Steinle, 0 100 17

Zarate 0 100 18
found 0 100 18
the 0 100 18
gun 0 100 18
at 0 100 18
the 0 100 18
pier… 0 100 18
but 0 100 18
the 0 100 18
stories 0 100 18
of 0 100 18
what 0 100 18
happened 0 100 18
copntradicted 0 100 18
one 0 100 18
another… 0 100 18

He 0 100 19
said 0 100 19
it 0 100 19
was 0 100 19
wrapped 0 100 19
in 0 100 19
cloth, 0 100 19
and 0 100 19
when 0 100 19

Zarate 0 100 19
unwrapped 0 100 19
it, 0 100 19
the 0 100 19
gun 0 100 19
accidentally 0 100 19
discharged. 0 100 19

But 0 100 20
in 0 100 20
a 0 100 20
police 0 100 20
interrogation, 0 100 20
Garcia 0 100 20
Zarate 0 100 20
admitted 0 100 20
to 0 100 20
firing 0 100 20
the 0 100 20
gun, 0 100 20
saying 0 100 20
he 0 100 20
was 0 100 20
aiming 0 100 20
at 0 100 20
a 0 100 20

He 0 100 21

he 0 100 21
stepped 0 100 21
on 0 100 21

gun, 0 100 21
causing 0 100 21
it 0 100 21
to 0 100 21
fire. 0 100 21

But 0 100 22
still, 0 100 22
after 0 100 22
six 0 100 22

– 1 64 21
the 1 64 21
easiest 1 64 21
one 1 64 21

head 1 64 21
off, 1 64 21
that’s 1 64 21
the 1 64 21
easiest. 1 64 21

Second 1 64 22
– 1 64 22
burn 1 64 22
them 1 64 22
to 1 64 22
death. 1 64 22

Third 1 64 23
– 1 64 23
throw 1 64 23
’em 1 64 23
off 1 64 23
a 1 64 23
cliff. 1 64 23

– 1 64 24

down 1 64 24
a 1 64 24
wall 1 64 24

they 1 64 24
die 1 64 24
under 1 64 24
that. 1 64 24

– 1 64 25

of 1 64 25
the 1 64 25

In 0 104 13
2003, 0 104 13
as 0 104 13
board 0 104 13

“traffic 0 104 13

As 0 104 13
Gonzalez 0 104 13
explained, 0 104 13
“This 0 104 13
is 0 104 13
a 0 104 13
sentiment 0 104 13
I 0 104 13

all 0 104 13
of 0 104 13
us 0 104 13
have 0 104 13
had. 0 104 13

You 0 104 14
have 0 104 14
to 0 104 14
rally 0 104 14
and 0 104 14
find 0 104 14
ways 0 104 14

opposing 0 104 14
what 0 104 14
you 0 104 14
don’t 0 104 14
like.” 0 104 14

In 0 104 15
2003 0 104 15
Gonzalez 0 104 15
ran 0 104 15
for 0 104 15
mayor 0 104 15
of 0 104 15
San 0 104 15
Francisco 0 104 15
but 0 104 15
lost 0 104 15

In 0 104 16
2008 0 104 16
Green 0 104 16
Party 0 104 16
presidential 0 104 16
candidate 0 104 16
Ralph 0 104 16

tapped 0 104 16
Gonzalez 0 104 16
for 0 104 16
vice 0 104 16
president. 0 104 16

“He 1 104 17
has 1 104 17
a 1 104 17
great, 1 104 17
steadfast 1 104 17
commitment 1 104 17
to 1 104 17
justice,” 1 104 17
Nader 0 104 17
told 0 104 17
reporters. 0 104 17

On 0 104 18
that 0 104 18
score, 0 104 18
the 0 104 18
Steinle 0 104 18
family 0 104 18
and 0 104 18
other 0 104 18
relatives 0 104 18
of 0 104 18
murder 0 104 18
victims 0 104 18
have 0 104 18
room 0 104 18
for 0 104 18
reasonable 0 104 18
doubt. 0 104 18

In 0 104 19
jury 0 104 19
selection, 0 104 19
Gonzalez 0 104 19
and 0 104 19
the 0 104 19
prosecutor, 0 104 19
assistant 0 104 19
district 0 104 19
attorney 0 104 19
Diana 0 104 19
Garcia, 0 104 19
included 0 104 19
three 0 104 19
“immigrants,” 0 104 19
quite 0 104 19
possibly 0 104 19
false-documented 0 104 19
illegals. 0 104 19

True 0 104 20
to 0 104 20
form, 0 104 20
judge 0 104 20
Samuel 0 104 20
Feng 0 104 20
sealed 0 104 20
the 0 104 20
identities 0 104 20
of 0 104 20
the 0 104 20
jurors. 0 104 20

So 0 104 21
observers 0 104 21
have 0 104 21
grounds 0 104 21
to 0 104 21
believe 0 104 21
that 0 104 21
Garcia 0 104 21
and 0 104 21
Gonzalez 0 104 21
both 0 104 21
got 0 104 21
the 0 104 21
jury 0 104 21
they 0 104 21
wanted. 0 104 21

Garcia 0 104 22
told 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
court 0 104 22
Zarate 0 104 22
was 0 104 22
playing 0 104 22
his 0 104 22
own 0 104 22
“secret 1 104 22
version 1 104 22
of 1 104 22
Russian 1 104 22
roulette,” 1 104 22
and 0 104 22
thus 0 104 22
parroted 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
defense’s 0 104 22
contention 0 104 22
that 0 104 22
the 0 104 22
shooting 0 104 22
was 0 104 22
all 0 104 22
a 0 104 22
matter 0 104 22
of 0 104 22
chance. 0 104 22

As 0 104 23
it 0 104 23
happens, 0 104 23
in 0 104 23
Russian 0 104 23
roulette 0 104 23
a 0 104 23
shooter 0 104 23
loads 0 104 23
one 0 104 23
bullet 0 104 23
into 0 104 23
a 0 104 23
six-shot 0 104 23
revolver, 0 104 23
spins 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
cylinder, 0 104 23
then 0 104 23
puts 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
gun 0 104 23
to 0 104 23
his 0 104 23
own 0 104 23
head 0 104 23
and 0 104 23
pulls 0 104 23
the 0 104 23
trigger. 0 104 23

In 0 104 24
a 0 104 24
central 0 104 24
fact 0 104 24
of 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
case, 0 104 24
Zarate 0 104 24
did 0 104 24
not 0 104 24
aim 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
gun 0 104 24
at 0 104 24
himself 0 104 24
but 0 104 24
fired 0 104 24
in 0 104 24
the 0 104 24
direction 0 104 24
of 0 104 24
Kate 0 104 24
Steinle. 0 104 24

In 0 104 25
another 0 104 25
established 0 104 25
fact, 0 104 25
the 0 104 25
bullet 0 104 25
struck 0 104 25
her 0 104 25
in 0 104 25
the 0 104 25
lower 0 104 25
back 0 104 25
and 0 104 25
tore 0 104 25
through 0 104 25
her 0 104 25
abdominal 0 104 25
aorta. 0 104 25

This 0 104 26
happened 0 104 26
in 0 104 26
broad 0 104 26
daylight, 0 104 26
but 0 104 26
as 0 104 26
in 0 104 26
In 0 104 26
the 0 104 26
Heat 0 104 26
of 0 104 26
the 0 104 26
Night, 0 104 26
they 0 104 26
had 0 104 26
the 0 104 26
body 0 104 26
which 0 104 26
was 0 104 26
dead. 0 104 26

Garcia 0 104 27
Zarate 0 104 27
confessed 0 104 27
to 0 104 27
firing 0 104 27
the 0 104 27
shot 0 104 27
and 0 104 27
had 0 104 27
gunpowder 0 104 27
residue 0 104 27
on 0 104 27
his 0 104 27
hands. 0 104 27

After 0 104 28
firing, 0 104 28
he 0 104 28
tossed 0 104 28
the 0 104 28
gun 0 104 28
in 0 104 28
the 0 104 28
water. 0 104 28

He 0 104 29
said 0 104 29
he 0 104 29
had 0 104 29
found 0 104 29
the 0 104 29
stolen 0 104 29
weapon 0 104 29
wrapped 0 104 29
in 0 104 29
a 0 104 29
cloth 0 104 29
and 0 104 29
that 0 104 29
it 0 104 29
discharged 0 104 29
by 0 104 29
itself, 0 104 29
both 0 104 29
utterly 0 104 29
unbelievable 0 104 29
claims. 0 104 29

Even 0 104 30
so, 0 104 30
the 0 104 30
politically 0 104 30
correct 0 104 30
jury 0 104 30
found 0 104 30
the 0 104 30
career 0 104 30
criminal 0 104 30
not 0 104 30
guilty 0 104 30
of 0 104 30
murder 0 104 30
and 0 104 30
manslaughter. 0 104 30

Any 0 104 31
observer 0 104 31
could 0 104 31
be 0 104 31
forgiven 0 104 31
for 0 104 31
believing 0 104 31
that 0 104 31
prosecution 0 104 31
and 0 104 31
defense 0 104 31
both 0 104 31
got 0 104 31
the 0 104 31
outcome 0 104 31
they 0 104 31
wanted. 0 104 31

Unlike 1 104 32
Stalin’s 1 104 32
trials 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
old 1 104 32
Bolsheviks, 1 104 32
and 1 104 32
Fidel 1 104 32
Castro’ 1 104 32
trial 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
General 1 104 32
Arnaldo 1 104 32
Ochoa, 1 104 32
this 1 104 32
show 1 104 32
trial 1 104 32
aimed 1 104 32
to 1 104 32
establish 1 104 32
innocence 1 104 32
for 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
guilty, 1 104 32
and 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
dynamics 1 104 32
of 1 104 32
the 1 104 32
left 1 104 32
were 1 104 32
on 1 104 32
full 1 104 32
display. 1 104 32

Denunciations 0 104 33
of 0 104 33
“gun 0 104 33
violence” 0 104 33
were 0 104 33
nowhere 0 104 33
in 0 104 33
evidence 0 104 33
and 0 104 33
expressions 0 104 33
of 0 104 33
sympathy 0 104 33
for 0 104 33
the 0 104 33
Steinle 0 104 33
family 0 104 33
proved 0 104 33
pathetically 0 104 33
weak. 0 104 33

As 0 104 34
Arthur 0 104 34
Koestler 0 104 34
said, 0 104 34
on 0 104 34
the 0 104 34
left 0 104 34
the 0 104 34
truth 0 104 34
is 0 104 34
spoken 0 104 34
with 0 104 34
loathing 0 104 34
and 0 104 34
falsehood 0 104 34
with 0 104 34
love. 0 104 34

On 0 104 35
the 0 104 35
left, 0 104 35
as 0 104 35
Orwell 0 104 35
had 0 104 35
it 0 104 35
in 0 104 35
Animal 0 104 35
Farm, 0 104 35
rats 0 104 35
are 0 104 35
comrades, 0 104 35
and 0 104 35
criminals 0 104 35
are 0 104 35
victims 0 104 35
of 0 104 35
capitalist 0 104 35
society. 0 104 35

In 0 104 36
the 0 104 36
view 0 104 36
of 0 104 36
Gonzalez, 0 104 36
society 1 104 36
is 1 104 36
progressing 1 104 36
toward 1 104 36
a 1 104 36
social 1 104 36
justice 1 104 36
paradise 1 104 36
ruled 1 104 36
by 1 104 36
a 1 104 36
wise 1 104 36
elite 1 104 36
that 1 104 36
knows 1 104 36
what’s 1 104 36
best 1 104 36
for 1 104 36
all. 1 104 36

In 0 104 37
this 0 104 37
inexorable 0 104 37
progress, 0 104 37
determined 0 104 37
by 0 104 37
history, 0 104 37
some 0 104 37
people 0 104 37
are 0 104 37
going 0 104 37
to 0 104 37
have 0 104 37
to 0 104 37
die. 0 104 37

As 1 104 38
Bertolt 1 104 38
Brecht 1 104 38
told 1 104 38
Sidney 1 104 38
Hook 1 104 38
about 1 104 38
Stalin’s 1 104 38
victims, 1 104 38
“the 1 104 38
more 1 104 38
innocent 1 104 38
they 1 104 38
are, 1 104 38
the 1 104 38
more 1 104 38
they 1 104 38
deserve 1 104 38
to 1 104 38
be 1 104 38
shot.” 1 104 38

Out 0 104 39
for 0 104 39
a 0 104 39
summer-day 0 104 39
walk 0 104 39
with 0 104 39
her 0 104 39
father 0 104 39
and 0 104 39
a 0 104 39
friend, 0 104 39
Kate 0 104 39
Steinle 0 104 39
was 0 104 39
a 0 104 39
completely 0 104 39
innocent 0 104 39
victim, 0 104 39
gunned 0 104 39
down 0 104 39
by 0 104 39
a 0 104 39
career 0 104 39
criminal 0 104 39
who 0 104 39
was 0 104 39
not 0 104 39
even 0 104 39
supposed 0 104 39
to 0 104 39
be 0 104 39
in 0 104 39
the 0 104 39
country 0 104 39
but 0 104 39
found 0 104 39
special 0 104 39
protection 0 104 39
in 0 104 39
the 0 104 39
sanctuary 0 104 39

part 0 104 39
of 0 104 39
the 0 104 39
sanctuary 0 104 39
state 0 104 39
of 0 104 39
California. 0 104 39

As 0 104 40
defense 0 104 40
attorney 0 104 40
Francisco 0 104 40
Ugarte 0 104 40
said, 0 104 40
the 0 104 40
verdict 0 104 40
was 0 104 40
a 0 104 40
“vindication 0 104 40
for 0 104 40
the 0 104 40
rights 0 104 40
of 0 104 40
immigrants.” 0 104 40

Since 0 104 41
Donald 0 104 41
Trump 0 104 41
mentioned 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
case, 0 104 41
former 0 104 41
vice-presidential 0 104 41
candidate 0 104 41
Matt 0 104 41
Gonzalez 0 104 41
had 0 104 41
to 0 104 41
establish 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
complete 0 104 41
innocence 0 104 41
of 0 104 41
the 0 104 41
shooter. 0 104 41

That 1 104 42
explains 1 104 42
the 1 104 42
effort 1 104 42
of 1 104 42
“The 1 104 42
Great 1 104 42

Any 0 104 42

What 0 105 7
then 0 105 7
indeed? 0 105 7

The 1 105 8
Dictator 1 105 8
Pope 1 105 8
even 0 105 8
feels 0 105 8
at 0 105 8
liberty 0 105 8
to 0 105 8
demand 0 105 8
that 0 105 8

God’s 0 105 8
words: 0 105 8
“And 0 105 8

which 0 105 8
Francis 0 105 8
has 0 105 8
decided, 0 105 8
after 0 105 8
2,000 0 105 8

a 0 105 8
“not 0 105 8
a 0 105 8
good 0 105 8
translation.” 0 105 8
Apparently 0 105 8
lost 0 105 8
on 0 105 8
Francis, 0 105 8
given 1 105 8
the 1 105 8
disordered 1 105 8
mélange 1 105 8
of 1 105 8

of 1 105 8
things 1 105 8

has 1 105 8
read 1 105 8
that 1 105 8
constitutes 1 105 8
his 1 105 8
theology, 1 105 8
is 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
distinction 0 105 8
between 0 105 8
sin, 0 105 8
a 0 105 8
culpable 0 105 8
act, 0 105 8
and 0 105 8
temptation, 0 105 8
which 0 105 8
arises 0 105 8
from 0 105 8
concupiscence 0 105 8
or 0 105 8
what 0 105 8
Saint 0 105 8
Thomas 0 105 8
called 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
fomes, 0 105 8
or 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
fleshly 0 105 8
inclination 0 105 8
to 0 105 8
sin, 0 105 8
which 0 105 8
grace 0 105 8
enables 0 105 8
us 0 105 8
to 0 105 8
control 0 105 8
by 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
rule 0 105 8
of 0 105 8
reason 0 105 8
over 0 105 8
the 0 105 8
passions. 0 105 8

But 0 105 9
now 0 105 9
we 0 105 9
are 0 105 9
witness 0 105 9
to 0 105 9
the 0 105 9
single 1 105 9
worst 1 105 9
act 1 105 9

the 0 105 9
entire 0 105 9
history 0 105 9
of 0 105 9
the 0 105 9
papacy. 0 105 9

The 0 105 10
Church 0 105 10
has 0 105 10
seen 0 105 10
a 0 105 10
number 0 105 10
of 0 105 10
Popes 0 105 10
who 0 105 10
have 0 105 10
abused 0 105 10
their 0 105 10
power, 0 105 10
Alexander 0 105 10
VI 0 105 10
being 0 105 10
the 0 105 10
most 0 105 10
popularly 0 105 10
known 0 105 10
example. 0 105 10

But 1 105 11
never, 1 105 11
before 1 105 11

has 1 105 11
there 1 105 11
been 1 105 11

dared 1 105 11
to 1 105 11
tyrannize 1 105 11
the 1 105 11
Magisterium 1 105 11
itself 1 105 11
by 1 105 11
attempting 1 105 11
to 1 105 11
bend 1 105 11
it 1 105 11
to 1 105 11
his 1 105 11
errant 1 105 11
personal 1 105 11
opinions. 1 105 11

has 0 105 12
officially 0 105 12
declared 0 105 12
that 0 105 12
the 0 105 12
“authentic 0 105 12
Magisterium” 0 105 12
includes 0 105 12
the 0 105 12

the 0 105 12
bishops 0 105 12
of 0 105 12
Buenos 0 105 12

for 0 105 12

of 0 105 12
Amoris 0 105 12

(AL), 0 105 12
which 0 105 12
he 0 105 12
expressly 0 105 12
approved 0 105 12
in 0 105 12
his 0 105 12
letter 0 105 12
to 0 105 12
them 0 105 12
as 0 105 12
the 0 105 12
only 0 105 12
correct 0 105 12
interpretation 0 105 12
of 0 105 12
his 0 105 12
will. 0 105 12

The 0 105 13
guidelines 0 105 13
have 0 105 13
been 0 105 13
published 0 105 13
in 0 105 13
the 0 105 13
AAS 0 105 13
along 0 105 13
with 0 105 13
Francis’s 0 105 13
private 0 105 13
missive, 0 105 13
which 0 105 13
is 0 105 13
suddenly 0 105 13
declared 0 105 13
to 0 105 13
be 0 105 13
“an 0 105 13
apostolic 0 105 13
letter.” 0 105 13

The 0 105 14
normalist 0 105 14
narrative 0 105 14
has 0 105 14
just 0 105 14
been 0 105 14
stripped 0 105 14
of 0 105 14
any 0 105 14
colorable 0 105 14
argument 0 105 14
that 0 105 14
nothing 0 105 14
is 0 105 14
too 0 105 14
terribly 0 105 14
amiss 0 105 14
with 0 105 14
this 0 105 14
pontificate. 0 105 14

We 0 105 15
are 0 105 15
now 0 105 15
expected 0 105 15
to 0 105 15
believe 0 105 15
that 0 105 15
the 0 105 15
“authentic 0 105 15
Magisterium”—meaning 0 105 15
simply 0 105 15
and 0 105 15
only 0 105 15
AL—teaches 0 105 15
what 0 105 15
the 0 105 15
guidelines 0 105 15
preposterously 0 105 15
declare, 0 105 15
solely 0 105 15
in 0 105 15
reliance 0 105 15
on 0 105 15
AL: 0 105 15

When 0 105 16
the 0 105 16
concrete 0 105 16
circumstances 0 105 16
of 0 105 16
a 0 105 16
couple 0 105 16
make 0 105 16
it 0 105 16
feasible, 0 105 16
especially 0 105 16
when 0 105 16
both 0 105 16
are 0 105 16
Christians 0 105 16
with 0 105 16
a 0 105 16
journey 0 105 16
of 0 105 16
faith, 0 105 16
one 0 105 16
may 0 105 16
propose 0 105 16
that 0 105 16
they 0 105 16
commit 0 105 16
to 0 105 16
living 0 105 16
in 0 105 16
continence…. 0 105 16

In 0 105 17
other 0 105 17
more 0 105 17
complex 0 105 17
circumstances, 0 105 17
and 0 105 17
when 0 105 17
it 0 105 17
is 0 105 17
not 0 105 17
possible 0 105 17
to 0 105 17
obtain 0 105 17
a 0 105 17
declaration 0 105 17
of 0 105 17
nullity, 0 105 17
the 0 105 17
aforementioned 0 105 17
option 0 105 17
may 0 105 17
not, 0 105 17
in 0 105 17
fact, 0 105 17
be 0 105 17
viable. 0 105 17

Nonetheless, 0 105 18
it 0 105 18
is 0 105 18
equally 0 105 18
possible 0 105 18
to 0 105 18
undertake 0 105 18
a 0 105 18
journey 0 105 18
of 0 105 18
discernment…. 0 105 18

[I]f 0 105 19
one 0 105 19
arrives 0 105 19
at 0 105 19
the 0 105 19
recognition 0 105 19
that, 0 105 19
in 0 105 19
a 0 105 19
concrete 0 105 19
case, 0 105 19
there 0 105 19
are 0 105 19
limitations 0 105 19
that 0 105 19
diminish 0 105 19
responsibility 0 105 19
and 0 105 19
culpability 0 105 19
(cf. 0 105 19

301-302), 0 105 20
particularly 0 105 20
when 0 105 20
a 0 105 20
person 0 105 20
judges 0 105 20
that 0 105 20
he 0 105 20
would 0 105 20
fall 0 105 20
into 0 105 20
a 0 105 20
subsequent 0 105 20
fault 0 105 20
by 0 105 20
damaging 0 105 20
the 0 105 20
children 0 105 20
of 0 105 20
the 0 105 20
new 0 105 20
union, 0 105 20
Amoris 0 105 20
Laetitia 0 105 20

up 0 105 20
the 0 105 20
possibility 0 105 20
of 0 105 20
access 0 105 20

As 0 105 22
Francis 0 105 22
would 0 105 22
have 0 105 22
it, 0 105 22
then, 0 105 22
the 0 105 22
“authentic 0 105 22
Magisterium” 0 105 22
has 0 105 22
just 0 105 22
flatly 0 105 22
contradicted 0 105 22
itself 0 105 22
for 0 105 22

Francis, 0 105 32
however, 0 105 32
has 0 105 32
purported 0 105 32
to 0 105 32
do 0 105 32

the 0 105 32
doctrine 0 105 32
of 0 105 32
the 0 105 32
Church. 0 105 32

The 0 105 33
attempt 0 105 33
is 0 105 33
void, 0 105 33
of 0 105 33
course, 0 105 33
and 0 105 33
the 0 105 33
appellation 0 105 33
“authentic 0 105 33
Magisterium” 0 105 33
is 0 105 33
fraudulent. 0 105 33

But 0 105 34
the 0 105 34
consequences 0 105 34
of 0 105 34
this 0 105 34
Pope’s 0 105 34
toying 1 105 34
with 1 105 34
the 1 105 34
teaching 1 105 34

of 0 105 34
the 0 105 34
Church 0 105 34
to 0 105 34
advance 0 105 34
half-baked 1 105 34
theological 1 105 34
notions, 1 105 34
such 0 105 34
as 0 105 34

strips 0 105 34
of 0 105 34
its 0 105 34
original 0 105 34
meaning) 0 105 34
are 0 105 34
catastrophic. 0 105 34

Over 0 105 35
the 0 105 35
past 0 105 35
year, 0 105 35
Cardinal 0 105 35
Burke 0 105 35

other 0 105 35
members 0 105 35
of 0 105 35
the 0 105 35
hierarchy 0 105 35
have 0 105 35
called 0 105 35
upon 0 105 35
Francis 0 105 35
to 0 105 35
“clarify” 0 105 35
his 0 105 35
intention 0 105 35
respecting 0 105 35
AL. 0 105 35

That 0 105 36
clarification 0 105 36
has 0 105 36
now 0 105 36
been 0 105 36
given: 0 105 36
Francis 0 105 36
intends, 0 105 36
if 0 105 36
it 0 105 36
were 0 105 36
possible, 0 105 36
to 0 105 36
change 0 105 36
the 0 105 36
unchangeable 0 105 36
teaching 0 105 36
of 0 105 36
the 0 105 36
Church 0 105 36
regarding 0 105 36
an 0 105 36
irrevocable 0 105 36
moral 0 105 36
norm 0 105 36
rooted 0 105 36
in 0 105 36
divine 0 105 36
law. 0 105 36

Even 1 105 37
if 1 105 37
the 1 105 37
attempt 1 105 37
is 1 105 37
void 1 105 37
and 1 105 37
of 1 105 37
no 1 105 37
effect 1 105 37
before 1 105 37
man 1 105 37
and 1 105 37
God—an 1 105 37
immoral 1 105 37
law 1 105 37
is 1 105 37
no 1 105 37
law 1 105 37
at 1 105 37
all—Francis 0 105 37
clearly 0 105 37
means 0 105 37
to 0 105 37
impose 0 105 37
his 0 105 37
will 0 105 37
by 0 105 37
fiat, 0 105 37
daring 0 105 37
invoke 0 105 37
the 0 105 37
“authentic 0 105 37
Magisterium” 0 105 37
to 0 105 37
cloak 1 105 37
his 1 105 37
absurd 1 105 37
novelties. 1 105 37

No 1 105 38
Pope 1 105 38
before 1 105 38
him 1 105 38
has 1 105 38
ever 1 105 38
dared 1 105 38
to 1 105 38
do 1 105 38
such 1 105 38
a 1 105 38
thing. 1 105 38

So 0 105 39
now 0 105 39
it 0 105 39
must 0 105 39
be 0 105 39
asked: 0 105 39
Where 0 105 39
are 0 105 39
the 0 105 39
cardinals 0 105 39
and 0 105 39
the 0 105 39
bishops? 0 105 39

With 0 105 40
one 0 105 40
or 0 105 40
two 0 105 40
noble 0 105 40
(however 0 105 40
inconsistent) 0 105 40
exceptions, 0 105 40
their 0 105 40
response 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Bergoglian 0 105 40
Debacle 0 105 40
thus 0 105 40
far 0 105 40
ranges 0 105 40
from 0 105 40
silence, 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
active 0 105 40
complicity, 0 105 40
to—at 0 105 40
best—hand-wringing 0 105 40
over 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
increasingly 0 105 40
chaotic 0 105 40
state 0 105 40
of 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Church 0 105 40
while 0 105 40
begging 0 105 40
the 0 105 40
Pope 0 105 40
to 0 105 40
“clarify” 0 105 40
his 0 105 40
already 0 105 40
perfectly 0 105 40
clear 0 105 40
intentions. 0 105 40

At 0 105 41
this 0 105 41
point, 0 105 41
continued 0 105 41
pleading 0 105 41
for 0 105 41
a 0 105 41
Bergoglian 0 105 41
“clarification” 0 105 41
can 0 105 41
only 0 105 41
give 0 105 41
rise 0 105 41
to 0 105 41
an 0 105 41
impression 0 105 41
of 0 105 41
disingenuousness, 0 105 41
whereas 0 105 41
continued 0 105 41
silence 0 105 41
about 0 105 41
the 0 105 41
papal 0 105 41
origin 0 105 41
of 0 105 41
this 0 105 41
ongoing 0 105 41
catastrophe 0 105 41
is 1 105 41
a 1 105 41
standing 1 105 41
rebuke 1 105 41
to 1 105 41
all 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
hierarchs 1 105 41
who 1 105 41
know 1 105 41
what 1 105 41
we 1 105 41
all 1 105 41
know: 1 105 41
that 1 105 41
at 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
epicenter 1 105 41
of 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
chaos 1 105 41
is 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
most 1 105 41
wayward 1 105 41
Pope 1 105 41
the 1 105 41
Church 1 105 41
has 1 105 41
ever 1 105 41
had 1 105 41
to 1 105 41
endure. 1 105 41

Continued 1 105 42

as 1 105 42
best 1 105 42
they 1 105 42
can, 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
constant 1 105 42
teaching 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Church 1 105 42
against 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
abuses 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
tyrant 1 105 42
on 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Chair 1 105 42

Peter 1 105 42

the 1 105 42
hierarchs 1 105 42
with 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
legacy 1 105 42
of 1 105 42
shame 1 105 42
and 1 105 42
a 1 105 42
terrible 1 105 42
accountability 1 105 42
before 1 105 42
the 1 105 42
Just 1 105 42
Judge. 1 105 42

Their 0 105 43
failure 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
defend 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Faith 0 105 43
by 0 105 43

the 0 105 43
one 0 105 43
they 0 105 43
know 0 105 43
full 0 105 43
well 0 105 43
is 0 105 43
attacking 0 105 43
it 0 105 43
almost 0 105 43
daily 0 105 43
lends 0 105 43
itself 0 105 43
ever 0 105 43
more 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
an 0 105 43
indictment 0 105 43
for 0 105 43
timidity 0 105 43
in 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
face 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
unprecedented 0 105 43
danger 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Church 0 105 43
and 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
cause 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
the 0 105 43
Gospel 0 105 43
of 0 105 43
which 0 105 43
they 0 105 43
are 0 105 43
divinely 0 105 43
charged 0 105 43
to 0 105 43
be 0 105 43
leaders. 0 105 43

The 1 105 44
time 1 105 44
for 1 105 44
“prudence” 1 105 44
is 1 105 44
long 1 105 44
past. 1 105 44

Prudence 0 105 45
now 0 105 45
gives 0 105 45
way 0 105 45
to 0 105 45
mere 0 105 45
pusillanimity. 0 105 45

The 0 105 46
time 0 105 46
for 0 105 46
hierarchical 0 105 46
action 0 105 46
is 0 105 46
now, 0 105 46
before 0 105 46
the 0 105 46
damage 0 105 46
to 0 105 46
the 0 105 46
Church 0 105 46
becomes 0 105 46
irreparable. 0 105 46

The 0 105 47
members 0 105 47
of 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
hierarchy 0 105 47
seemingly 0 105 47
cowed 0 105 47
by 0 105 47
a 1 105 47
papal 1 105 47
tyranny 1 105 47
the 1 105 47
Church 1 105 47
has 1 105 47
never 1 105 47
before 1 105 47
seen 1 105 47
must 0 105 47
rise 0 105 47
immediately 0 105 47
and 0 105 47
give 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
courageous 0 105 47
answer 0 105 47
to 0 105 47
the 0 105 47
challenge 0 105 47
posed 0 105 47
long 0 105 47
ago 0 105 47
by 0 105 47
Monsignor 0 105 47
Klaus 0 105 47
Gamber, 0 105 47
when 0 105 47
an 0 105 47
already 0 105 47
monumental 0 105 47
ecclesial 0 105 47
crisis 0 105 47
was 0 105 47
still 0 105 47
in 0 105 47
what 0 105 47
can 0 105 47
now 0 105 47
can 0 105 47
be 0 105 47
seen 0 105 47
as 0 105 47
merely 0 105 47
a 0 105 47
preliminary 0 105 47
stage: 0 105 47

Where 0 105 48
in 0 105 48
our 0 105 48
Church 0 105 48
are 0 105 48
the 0 105 48
leaders 0 105 48
who 0 105 48
can 0 105 48
show 0 105 48
us 0 105 48
the 0 105 48
right 0 105 48
path? 0 105 48

Where 0 105 49
are 0 105 49
the 0 105 49
bishops 0 105 49
courageous 0 105 49
enough 0 105 49
to 1 105 49
cut 1 105 49
out 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
cancerous 1 105 49
growth 1 105 49
of 1 105 49
modernist 1 105 49
theology 1 105 49
that 1 105 49
has 1 105 49
implanted 1 105 49
itself 1 105 49
and 1 105 49
is 1 105 49
festering 1 105 49
within 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
celebration 1 105 49
of 1 105 49
even 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
most 1 105 49
sacred 1 105 49
mysteries, 1 105 49
before 1 105 49
the 1 105 49
cancer 1 105 49
spreads 1 105 49
and 1 105 49
causes 1 105 49
even 1 105 49
greater 1 105 49
damage? 1 105 49

What 0 105 50
we 0 105 50
need 0 105 50
today 0 105 50
is 0 105 50
a 0 105 50
new 0 105 50
Athanasius, 0 105 50
a 0 105 50
new 0 105 50
Basil, 0 105 50
bishops 0 105 50
like 0 105 50
those 0 105 50
who 0 105 50
in 0 105 50
the 0 105 50
fourth 0 105 50
century 0 105 50
fought 0 105 50
courageously 0 105 50
against 0 105 50
Arianism 0 105 50
when 0 105 50
almost 0 105 50
the 0 105 50
whole 0 105 50
of 0 105 50
Christendom 0 105 50
had 0 105 50
succumbed 0 105 50
to 0 105 50
heresy. 0 105 50

Will 0 105 51
none 0 105 51
of 0 105 51
the 0 105 51
hierarchs 0 105 51
rise 0 105 51
to 0 105 51
defend 0 105 51
the 0 105 51
Church 0 105 51
as 0 105 51
“a 0 105 51
new 0 105 51
Athanasius, 0 105 51
a 0 105 51
new 0 105 51
Basil”? 0 105 51

Even 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
best 0 105 52
among 0 105 52
them 0 105 52
continue 0 105 52
to 0 105 52
limit 0 105 52
themselves 0 105 52
to 0 105 52
generalized 0 105 52
lamentations 0 105 52
at 0 105 52
conferences 0 105 52
or 0 105 52
in 0 105 52
interviews 0 105 52
about 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
parlous 0 105 52
state 0 105 52
of 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
Church 0 105 52
or 0 105 52
at 0 105 52
most 0 105 52
the 0 105 52
“confusion” 0 105 52
Francis 0 105 52
has 0 105 52
caused 0 105 52
by 0 105 52
not 0 105 52
“clarifying” 0 105 52
precisely 0 105 52
what 0 105 52
he 0 105 52
has 0 105 52
just 0 105 52
clarified. 0 105 52

They 0 105 53
avoid 0 105 53
the 0 105 53
absolutely 0 105 53
necessary 0 105 53
direct 0 105 53
and 0 105 53
public 0 105 53
exposure 0 105 53
of 0 105 53
error 0 105 53
at 0 105 53
its 0 105 53
source. 0 105 53

That 1 105 54
error 1 105 54
threatens 1 105 54
to 1 105 54
overwhelm 1 105 54
the 1 105 54
Church 1 105 54
while 1 105 54
they 1 105 54
do 1 105 54
little 1 105 54
more 1 105 54
than 1 105 54
fret 1 105 54
about 1 105 54
a 1 105 54
situation 1 105 54
whose 1 105 54
self-evident 1 105 54
cause—a 1 105 54
reckless 1 105 54
Pope 1 105 54
in 1 105 54
love 1 105 54
with 1 105 54
his 1 105 54
own 1 105 54
ideas 1 105 54
and 1 105 54
filled 1 105 54
with 1 105 54
contempt 1 105 54
for 1 105 54
Tradition—they 1 105 54
seem 1 105 54
incapable 1 105 54
of 1 105 54
identifying. 1 105 54

Concerned 0 105 55
clergy 0 105 55
and 0 105 55
laity 0 105 55
throughout 0 105 55
the 0 105 55
Catholic 0 105 55
world 0 105 55
are 0 105 55
doing 0 105 55
what 0 105 55
they 0 105 55
can 0 105 55
according 0 105 55
to 0 105 55
their 0 105 55
stations. 0 105 55

But 0 105 56
in 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
midst 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
that 0 105 56
“final 0 105 56
battle” 0 105 56
over 0 105 56
marriage 0 105 56
and 0 105 56
family 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
which 0 105 56
Sister 0 105 56
Lucia 0 105 56
warned 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
late 0 105 56
Cardinal 0 105 56
Caffarra 0 105 56
in 0 105 56
light 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
Third 0 105 56
Secret 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
Fatima, 0 105 56
within 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
human 0 105 56
element 0 105 56
of 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
Church 0 105 56
only 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
cardinals 0 105 56
and 0 105 56
the 0 105 56
bishops 0 105 56
possess 0 105 56
the 1 105 56
divinely 1 105 56
bestowed 1 105 56
power 1 105 56
to 1 105 56
repel 1 105 56
an 1 105 56
assault 1 105 56
on 1 105 56
marriage, 1 105 56
family 1 105 56
and 1 105 56
the 1 105 56
very 1 105 56
integrity 1 105 56
of 1 105 56
the 1 105 56
Faith 1 105 56
that 1 105 56
is 1 105 56
now, 1 105 56
for 1 105 56
the 1 105 56
first 1 105 56
time 1 105 56
in 1 105 56
Church 1 105 56
history, 1 105 56
being 0 105 56
led 0 105 56
by 0 105 56
a 0 105 56
Roman 0 105 56
Pontiff. 0 105 56

This 0 105 57
undeniably 0 105 57
apocalyptic 0 105 57
development 0 105 57
imposes 0 105 57
upon 0 105 57
the 0 105 57
hierarchs—first 0 105 57
and 0 105 57
foremost 0 105 57
in 0 105 57
the 0 105 57
Church—the 0 105 57
duty 0 105 57
to 0 105 57
act. 0 105 57

True 1 105 58
love 1 105 58
for 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
Church, 1 105 58
indeed 1 105 58
true 1 105 58
charity 1 105 58
toward 1 105 58
Francis 1 105 58
himself, 1 105 58
requires 1 105 58
of 1 105 58
them 1 105 58
nothing 1 105 58
less 1 105 58
than 1 105 58
what 1 105 58
was 1 105 58
required 1 105 58
of 1 105 58
Saint 1 105 58
Paul 1 105 58
when 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
first 1 105 58
Pope 1 105 58
fell 1 105 58
into 1 105 58
error 1 105 58
that 1 105 58
jeopardized 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
very 1 105 58
mission 1 105 58
of 1 105 58
the 1 105 58
Church: 1 105 58
that 1 105 58
Peter 1 105 58
be 1 105 58
withstood 1 105 58
to 1 105 58
his 1 105 58

Francesco 0 106 3
Coccopalmerio, 0 106 3
president 0 106 3
of 0 106 3

Pontifical 0 106 3
Council 0 106 3
for 0 106 3

made 0 106 3
it 0 106 3
very 0 106 3
clear 0 106 3
to 0 106 3
the 0 106 3

News 0 106 3
Service 0 106 3
on 0 106 3
December 0 106 3
5 0 106 3
what 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Pope 0 106 3
is 0 106 3
up 0 106 3
to: 0 106 3
“The 0 106 3
fact 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
pope 0 106 3
requested 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
his 0 106 3
letter 0 106 3
and 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
interpretations 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Buenos 0 106 3
Aires 0 106 3
bishops 0 106 3
be 0 106 3
published 0 106 3
in 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
AAS 0 106 3
means 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
His 0 106 3
Holiness 0 106 3
has 0 106 3
given 0 106 3
these 0 106 3
documents 0 106 3
a 0 106 3
particular 0 106 3
qualification 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
elevates 0 106 3
them 0 106 3
to 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
level 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
being 0 106 3
official 0 106 3
teachings 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
church. 0 106 3

While 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
content 0 106 4
of 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
pope’s 0 106 4
letter 0 106 4
itself 0 106 4
does 0 106 4
not 0 106 4
contain 0 106 4
teachings 0 106 4
on 0 106 4
faith 0 106 4
and 0 106 4
morals, 0 106 4
it 0 106 4
does 0 106 4
point 0 106 4
toward 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
interpretations 0 106 4
of 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
Argentine 0 106 4
bishops 0 106 4
and 0 106 4
confirms 0 106 4
them 0 106 4
as 0 106 4
authentically 0 106 4
reflecting 0 106 4
his 0 106 4
own 0 106 4
mind. 0 106 4

Thus 0 106 5
together 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
two 0 106 5
documents 0 106 5
became 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
Holy 0 106 5
Father’s 0 106 5
authentic 0 106 5
magisterium 0 106 5
for 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
whole 0 106 5
church.” 0 106 5

What 0 106 6
Cardinal 0 106 6
Burke 0 106 6
rightly 0 106 6
describes 0 106 6
as 0 106 6
lacking 1 106 6
in 1 106 6
any 1 106 6
magisterial 1 106 6
weight 1 106 6
whatsoever—and, 1 106 6
in 0 106 6
fact, 0 106 6
in 0 106 6
dire 0 106 6
need 0 106 6
of 0 106 6
clarification 0 106 6
and 0 106 6
correction— 0 106 6
has 0 106 6
by 0 106 6
papal 0 106 6
fiat 0 106 6
been 0 106 6
declared 0 106 6
magisterial, 0 106 6
and 0 106 6
thus 0 106 6
binding 0 106 6
on 0 106 6
us 0 106 6
all. 0 106 6

Francis 1 106 7
made 1 106 7
it 1 106 7
clear 1 106 7
that 1 106 7
the 1 106 7
Argentine 1 106 7
bishops’ 1 106 7
interpretation 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
AL 1 106 7
allowing 1 106 7
public 1 106 7
adulterers 1 106 7
to 1 106 7
receive 1 106 7
Holy 1 106 7
Communion 1 106 7
“explains 1 106 7
precisely 1 106 7
the 1 106 7
meaning 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
Chapter 1 106 7
VIII 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
‘Amoris 1 106 7
Laetitia.’ 1 106 7
There 1 106 7
are 1 106 7
no 1 106 7
other 1 106 7
interpretations.” 1 106 7

I 0 106 8
would 0 106 8
imagine 0 106 8
this 0 106 8
outrageous 1 106 8
overreach 1 106 8
of 1 106 8
papal 1 106 8
authority 1 106 8
on 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
Pope's 0 106 8
part 0 106 8
would 0 106 8
make 0 106 8
it 0 106 8
ominously 1 106 8
clear 1 106 8
to 0 106 8
Cardinal 0 106 8
Burke 0 106 8
that 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
time 0 106 8
has 0 106 8
come 0 106 8
to 0 106 8
issue 0 106 8
his 0 106 8
public 0 106 8
correction 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
Pope 0 106 8
Francis's 0 106 8
erroneous 0 106 8
teaching. 0 106 8

The 0 106 9
moment, 0 106 9
it 0 106 9
would 0 106 9
seem, 0 106 9
has 0 106 9
come. 0 106 9

Cardinal 0 106 10
Burke, 0 106 10
please 0 106 10
and 0 106 10
in 0 106 10
God's 1 106 10
Holy 1 106 10
Name, 1 106 10
we 1 106 10
beg 1 106 10
you 1 106 10
to 1 106 10
act 1 106 10
now 1 106 10
-- 1 106 10
before 1 106 10
Pope 1 106 10
Francis 1 106 10
succeeds 1 106 10
in 1 106 10
tearing 1 106 10
the 1 106 10
Church 1 106 10
in 1 106 10
half 1 106 10
completely. 1 106 10

We 0 106 11
fear 0 106 11
that 0 106 11
your 0 106 11
silence 0 106 11
now, 0 106 11
in 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
face 0 106 11
of 0 106 11
this 1 106 11
latest 1 106 11
papal 1 106 11
travesty, 1 106 11
may 0 106 11
suggest 0 106 11
consent 0 106 11
to 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
claim 0 106 11
that 0 106 11
Amoris 0 106 11
Laetitia 0 106 11
is 0 106 11
magisterial, 0 106 11
and 0 106 11
thus 0 106 11
prove 0 106 11
more 0 106 11
damaging 0 106 11
than 0 106 11
if 0 106 11
you 0 106 11
had 0 106 11
never 0 106 11
raised 0 106 11
your 0 106 11
voice 0 106 11
at 0 106 11

you 0 107 12

this 0 107 12

as 0 107 12
the 0 107 12

our 0 107 12

get 0 107 12

it 0 107 12

It’s 0 109 1
no 0 109 1
secret 0 109 1
that 0 109 1
the 0 109 1
Trump 0 109 1

has 0 109 1
a 0 109 1
strong 0 109 1
distaste 0 109 1
for 0 109 1
Iran. 0 109 1

Iran 0 109 2
is 0 109 2
one 0 109 2
of 0 109 2
the 0 109 2
only 0 109 2
issues 0 109 2
on 0 109 2
which 0 109 2
the 0 109 2
U.S. 0 109 2
president 0 109 2
has 0 109 2
remained 0 109 2
relatively 0 109 2
consistent. 0 109 2

Trump 0 109 3
berated 0 109 3
the 0 109 3
country 0 109 3
both 0 109 3
before 0 109 3
and 0 109 3
after 0 109 3
taking 0 109 3
office. 0 109 3

However, 0 109 4
Trump’s 0 109 4
anti-Iran 0 109 4
strategy 0 109 4
goes 1 109 4
against 1 109 4
the 1 109 4
better 1 109 4
judgment 1 109 4
of 0 109 4
even 0 109 4

to 1 109 4
see 1 109 4
the 1 109 4
U.S. 1 109 4
isolated 1 109 4
on 1 109 4
the 1 109 4
world 1 109 4
stage. 1 109 4

Fortunately 0 109 5
for 0 109 5
Trump, 0 109 5
however, 0 109 5
he 0 109 5
is 0 109 5
not 0 109 5
alone 0 109 5
in 0 109 5
his 0 109 5
bid 0 109 5

Haley’s 0 109 7
essential 0 109 7

by 0 109 7
the 0 109 7
Iranian 0 109 7

and 0 109 7
that 0 109 7

not 0 109 7
sit 0 109 7

“If 1 109 8

“There 0 109 9
is 0 109 9

of 0 109 44

extra-marital 0 110 2

so 0 110 2

an 0 110 2
ill-defined 0 110 2

As 0 110 2
Father 0 110 2
Brian 0 110 2
Harrison 0 110 2
has 0 110 2
so 0 110 2
trenchantly 0 110 2
observed, 0 110 2
this 0 110 2
means 0 110 2
that 0 110 2
people 0 110 2
embroiled 0 110 2
in 0 110 2
adultery 0 110 2
can 0 110 2

they 0 110 2
“discern” 0 110 2
that 0 110 2

not 0 110 2
be 0 110 2
receiving 0 110 2

they 1 110 3

Then 0 110 4
there 0 110 4
is 0 110 4
the 0 110 4
endlessly 0 110 4
double-talking 0 110 4
Cardinal 0 110 4
Müller. 0 110 4

In 0 110 5
a 0 110 5
recent 0 110 5
interview 0 110 5
concerning 0 110 5
Rocco 0 110 5
Buttiglione’s 0 110 5
verbal 1 110 5
contortions 1 110 5
aimed 0 110 5
at 0 110 5
demonstrating 0 110 5
that 0 110 5
the 0 110 5
administration 0 110 5
of 0 110 5
Holy 0 110 5
Communion 0 110 5
to 0 110 5
public 0 110 5
adulterers 0 110 5
is 0 110 5
consistent 0 110 5
with 0 110 5
the 0 110 5
Church’s 0 110 5
bimillenial 0 110 5
prohibition 0 110 5
of 0 110 5
precisely 0 110 5
that, 0 110 5
Müller 0 110 5
proposed 0 110 5
this 0 110 5
preposterous 1 110 5
“solution” 1 110 5
to 0 110 5
a 0 110 5
“problem” 0 110 5
that 0 110 5
does 0 110 5
not 0 110 5
exist: 0 110 5

It 0 110 6
is 0 110 6
possible 0 110 6
that 0 110 6
the 0 110 6
penitent 0 110 6
may 0 110 6
be 0 110 6
convinced 0 110 6
in 0 110 6
conscience, 0 110 6
and 0 110 6
with 0 110 6
good 0 110 6
reasons, 0 110 6
of 0 110 6
the 0 110 6
invalidity 0 110 6
of 0 110 6
the 0 110 6
first 0 110 6
marriage 0 110 6
even 0 110 6
though 0 110 6
they 0 110 6
cannot 0 110 6
offer 0 110 6
canonical 0 110 6
proof. 0 110 6

In 0 110 7
this 0 110 7
case 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
marriage 0 110 7
valid 0 110 7
before 0 110 7
God 0 110 7
would 0 110 7
be 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
second 0 110 7
one 0 110 7
and 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
pastor 0 110 7
could 0 110 7
grant 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
sacrament, 0 110 7
certainly 0 110 7
with 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
appropriate 0 110 7
precautions 0 110 7
as 0 110 7
not 0 110 7
to 0 110 7
scandalize 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
community 0 110 7
of 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
faithful 0 110 7
and 0 110 7
not 0 110 7
to 0 110 7
weaken 0 110 7
the 0 110 7
conviction 0 110 7
of 0 110 7
marriage 0 110 7
indissolubility. 0 110 7

The 0 110 8
Cardinal 0 110 8
knows 0 110 8
this 0 110 8
is 0 110 8
moral 1 110 8
and 1 110 8
canonical 1 110 8
nonsense. 1 110 8

No 1 110 9
Catholic, 1 110 9
whether 1 110 9
or 1 110 9
not 1 110 9
he 1 110 9
consults 1 110 9
a 1 110 9
priest, 1 110 9
can 1 110 9
declare 1 110 9
for 1 110 9
himself 1 110 9
that 1 110 9
his 1 110 9
marriage 1 110 9
in 1 110 9
the 1 110 9
Church 1 110 9
was 1 110 9
invalid, 1 110 9
especially 1 110 9
when—indeed 1 110 9
because—he 1 110 9
lacks 1 110 9
canonical 1 110 9
proof 1 110 9
of 1 110 9
invalidity. 1 110 9

Moreover, 0 110 10
absent 0 110 10
an 0 110 10
annulment 0 110 10
granted 0 110 10
by 0 110 10
the 0 110 10
competent 0 110 10

tribunal, 0 110 10
a 0 110 10
purported 0 110 10
“second 0 110 10
marriage” 0 110 10

an 0 110 10
invalid 0 110 10
civil 0 110 10
ceremony 0 110 10
and 0 110 10
thus 0 110 10
a 0 110 10

case 0 110 16
in 0 110 16
which 0 110 16
a 0 110 16

the 0 110 16

a 0 110 16

Even 0 110 17
then, 0 110 17
the 0 110 17

Müller 0 110 18
think 0 110 18
we 0 110 18
are 0 110 18
fools? 0 110 18

Some 0 110 19
of 0 110 19
us 0 110 19
apparently 0 110 19
are, 0 110 19
or 0 110 19
at 0 110 19

are 0 110 19

neo-Pharisaical 0 110 19

we 1 110 29

all 1 110 31

President 0 65 8

This 0 65 9

Syria, 0 65 9
Damascus 0 65 9

have 1 65 10
a 1 65 10
point? 1 65 10

Now 0 65 11
that 0 65 11
ISIS 0 65 11
has 0 65 11
been 0 65 11

Syria, 0 65 11
by 1 65 11

The 0 65 13

commitment 0 65 13
to 0 65 13
Syria, 0 65 13
he 0 65 13
said, 0 65 13
is 0 65 13
now 0 65 13
open-ended. 0 65 13

Our 0 65 14
goals: 0 65 14
Guarantee 0 65 14
al-Qaida 0 65 14
and 0 65 14
ISIS 0 65 14
do 0 65 14
not 0 65 14
return 0 65 14
and 0 65 14
set 0 65 14
up 0 65 14
sanctuary; 0 65 14
cope 0 65 14
with 0 65 14

Iranian 0 65 14

the 0 65 14
removal 0 65 14
of 0 65 14
Bashar 0 65 14
Assad's 0 65 14
ruthless 1 65 14
regime. 0 65 14

But 1 65 15
who 1 65 15
authorized 1 65 15
this 1 65 15
strategic 1 65 15
commitment, 1 65 15
of 0 65 15
indefinite 0 65 15
duration, 0 65 15
in 0 65 15
Syria, 0 65 15
when 0 65 15
near 0 65 15
two 0 65 15

Again 0 65 16
and 0 65 16
again, 0 65 16
the 0 65 16
American 0 65 16
people 0 65 16
have 0 65 16

not 0 65 16

of 1 65 17
no 1 65 17

Have 1 65 18
the 1 65 18
American 1 65 18
people 1 65 18
been 1 65 18

Will 0 65 19

armed 0 65 19
Kurds 0 65 19
on 0 65 19
Turkey's 0 65 19

when 0 65 19
the 0 65 19
Turks 0 65 19
regard 0 65 19
them 0 65 19
as 0 65 19
terrorists? 0 65 19

Are 1 65 20
we 1 65 20
prepared 1 65 20
for 1 65 20
a 1 65 20
shooting 1 65 20

The 0 65 21
U.S. 0 65 21
coalition 0 65 21
in 0 65 21
Syria 0 65 21
said 0 65 21
this 0 65 21
week 0 65 21
the 0 65 21

Remarkable: 0 65 22
A 0 65 22
U.S.-created 0 65 22
border 0 65 22
army 0 65 22
is 0 65 22

and 0 65 22
Iraq, 0 65 22
over 0 65 22
Syria's 0 65 22
objections. 0 65 22

And 0 65 23
the 0 65 23
U.S. 0 65 23
military 0 65 23
will 0 65 23
stand 0 65 23
behind 0 65 23
the 0 65 23
BSF. 0 65 23

Are 1 65 24
the 1 65 24
2,000 1 65 24
U.S. 1 65 24
troops 1 65 24
in 1 65 24
Syria 1 65 24
really 1 65 24
up 1 65 24
to 1 65 24
that 1 65 24
task, 1 65 24
should 0 65 24
the 0 65 24
Turks 0 65 24
decide 0 65 24
to 0 65 24

the 0 65 24
Syrian 0 65 24
border 0 65 24

or 0 65 24
should 0 65 24
the 0 65 24

Who 0 65 25
sanctioned 0 65 25
this 0 65 25
commitment 0 65 25
to 0 65 25
a 0 65 25
new 0 65 25

which, 0 65 25
if 0 65 25

its 0 65 25
Russian 0 65 25

and 0 65 25
the 0 65 25
Turks, 0 65 25
do 0 65 25
not 0 65 25
all 0 65 25
back 0 65 25
down, 0 65 25
risks 1 65 25
a 1 65 25
major 1 65 25
U.S. 1 65 25
war 1 65 25
with 1 65 25
no 1 65 25
allies 1 65 25
but 1 65 25
the 1 65 25
Kurds? 1 65 25

As 0 65 26
for 0 65 26
Syria's 0 65 26
Kurds 0 65 26
casting 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
lot 0 65 26
with 0 65 26
the 0 65 26
Americans, 0 65 26
one 0 65 26
wonders: 0 65 26
Did 0 65 26
they 0 65 26
not 0 65 26
observe 0 65 26
what 0 65 26
happened 0 65 26
when 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
Iraqi 0 65 26
cousins, 0 65 26
after 0 65 26
helping 0 65 26
us 0 65 26
drive 0 65 26
ISIS 0 65 26
out 0 65 26
of 0 65 26
Mosul, 0 65 26
were 0 65 26
themselves 0 65 26
driven 0 65 26
out 0 65 26
of 0 65 26
Kirkuk 0 65 26
by 0 65 26
the 0 65 26
Iraqi 0 65 26
army, 0 65 26
as 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
U.S. 0 65 26
allies 0 65 26
watched? 0 65 26

In 0 65 27
the 0 65 27
six-year 0 65 27
Syrian 0 65 27
civil 0 65 27
war, 0 65 27
which 0 65 27
may 0 65 27
be 0 65 27
about 0 65 27
to 0 65 27
enter 0 65 27
a 0 65 27
new 0 65 27
phase, 0 65 27
America 0 65 27
faces 0 65 27
a 0 65 27
familiar 0 65 27
situation. 0 65 27

While 0 65 28
our 0 65 28
"allies" 0 65 28
and 0 65 28
adversaries 0 65 28
have 0 65 28
vital 0 65 28
interests 0 65 28
there, 0 65 28
we 0 65 28
do 0 65 28
not. 0 65 28

The 0 65 29
Assads 0 65 29
have 0 65 29
been 0 65 29
in 0 65 29
power 0 65 29
for 0 65 29
the 0 65 29
lifetime 0 65 29
of 0 65 29
most 0 65 29
Americans. 0 65 29

And 0 65 30
we 0 65 30
Americans 0 65 30
have 0 65 30
never 0 65 30
shown 0 65 30
a 0 65 30
desire 0 65 30
to 0 65 30
fight 0 65 30
there. 0 65 30

Assad 0 65 31
has 0 65 31
a 0 65 31
vital 0 65 31
interest: 0 65 31
preservation 0 65 31
of 0 65 31
his 0 65 31
family 0 65 31
regime 0 65 31
and 0 65 31
the 0 65 31
reunification 0 65 31
of 0 65 31
his 0 65 31
country. 0 65 31

The 0 65 32
Turks 0 65 32
have 0 65 32
a 0 65 32
vital 0 65 32
interest 0 65 32
in 0 65 32
keeping 0 65 32

minority, 0 65 32
which 0 65 32
seeks 0 65 32
greater 0 65 32
independence. 0 65 32

The 0 65 33
Israelis 0 65 33
and 0 65 33
Saudi 0 65 33
royals 0 65 33
want 0 65 33
the 0 65 33

to 0 65 33
keep 0 65 33

The 0 65 34
U.S. 0 65 34

wants 0 65 34
us 0 65 34
to 0 65 34
smash 0 65 34
Iran 0 65 34

Have 1 65 35

Representative 0 117 6

that 0 117 6

in 0 117 6
the 0 117 6
deadly 0 117 6
attack. 0 117 6

Perry 0 117 7
brought 0 117 7
up 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
fact 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
we 0 117 7
can't 0 117 7
seem 0 117 7
to 0 117 7
get 0 117 7
information 0 117 7
in 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
case 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
public 0 117 7
needs 0 117 7
to 0 117 7
be 0 117 7
made 0 117 7
aware 0 117 7
of, 0 117 7
something 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
was 0 117 7
brought 0 117 7
up 0 117 7
in 0 117 7
a 0 117 7
district 0 117 7
courtroom 0 117 7
earlier 0 117 7
this 0 117 7
week. 0 117 7

Additionally, 0 117 8
the 0 117 8
family 0 117 8
of 0 117 8
Stephen 0 117 8
Paddock 0 117 8
just 0 117 8
received 0 117 8
his 0 117 8
cremated 0 117 8
remains 0 117 8
on 0 117 8
Thursday 0 117 8
and 0 117 8
his 0 117 8
brother 0 117 8
said 0 117 8
that 0 117 8
the 0 117 8
family 0 117 8
has 0 117 8
yet 0 117 8
to 0 117 8
receive 0 117 8
an 0 117 8
autopsy 0 117 8
report. 0 117 8

Why 0 117 9
is 0 117 9
that? 0 117 9

Everyone 0 117 10
who 0 117 10
was 0 117 10
killed 0 117 10
that 0 117 10
night 0 117 10
had 0 117 10
autopsies 0 117 10
and 0 117 10
those 0 117 10
have 0 117 10
been 0 117 10
released. 0 117 10

We're 0 117 11

Paddock 0 117 11
shot 0 117 11
himself 0 117 11
in 0 117 11
the 0 117 11
head, 0 117 11
right? 0 117 11

Why 1 117 12
would 1 117 12
the 1 117 12
autopsy 1 117 12
report 1 117 12
be 1 117 12
something 1 117 12
that 1 117 12
needs 1 117 12

be 1 117 12
withheld 1 117 12
from 1 117 12
the 1 117 12

or 1 117 12
his 1 117 12
family? 1 117 12

"Recently 0 117 13
I’ve 0 117 13
been 0 117 13
made 0 117 13

they 0 117 14
would 0 117 14

"In 0 117 15
June 0 117 15
and 0 117 15
August." 0 117 15

"And 0 117 16
then 0 117 16
after 0 117 16
the 0 117 16

four 0 117 16

"Something’s 1 117 17
not 1 117 17
adding 1 117 17
up." 1 117 17

"I’m 0 117 18
just 0 117 18
telling 0 117 18

possible 0 117 18

Perry 0 117 18

The 0 117 19
investigation 0 117 19
has 0 117 19
been 0 117 19
conducted 0 117 19
by 0 117 19
local 0 117 19
and 0 117 19
state 0 117 19
police, 0 117 19
not 0 117 19
the 0 117 19
feds, 0 117 19
and 0 117 19
yet, 0 117 19
they 0 117 19
continue 0 117 19
to 0 117 19
claim 0 117 19
there 0 117 19
is 0 117 19
not 0 117 19
Islamic 0 117 19
terrorist 0 117 19
involvement. 0 117 19

Yet, 0 117 20
though 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
claim 0 117 20
that 0 117 20
Paddock 0 117 20
was 0 117 20
a 0 117 20
lone 0 117 20

they 0 117 20
continue 0 117 20
to 0 117 20
withhold 0 117 20

of 0 117 20
him 0 117 20
in 0 117 20
Mandalay 0 117 20

because 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
are 0 117 20

investigating 0 117 20
other 0 117 20

to 0 117 20
charge 0 117 20
in 0 117 20
the 0 117 20

And 0 117 21
no 0 117 21
one 0 117 21
seems 0 117 21
to 0 117 21

None 0 117 22
of 0 117 22
this 0 117 22
is 0 117 22
really 0 117 22
that 0 117 22
surprising. 0 117 22

If 0 117 23
you 0 117 23
recall, 0 117 23
we 0 117 23
reported 0 117 23
on 0 117 23
Islamic 0 117 23
terrorists 0 117 23
settling 0 117 23

some 0 117 23
years 0 117 23
back 0 117 23

that 0 117 23
came 0 117 23
out 0 117 23
as 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
infamous 0 117 23
"Gang 0 117 23

just 0 117 23
seven 0 117 23
years 0 117 23

with 0 117 23
a 0 117 23
majority 0 117 23
of 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
Senate 0 117 23
saying 0 117 23
they 0 117 23
didn't 0 117 23

the 0 117 23

was 0 117 23
being 0 117 23
built. 0 117 23

Three 0 117 24
years 0 117 24
prior 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
report, 0 117 24
there 0 117 24
was 0 117 24
a 0 117 24
video 0 117 24
report 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
seems 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
have 0 117 24
provided 0 117 24
a 0 117 24
bit 0 117 24
of 0 117 24
evidence 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
the 0 117 24
claim 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
Islamists 0 117 24
were 0 117 24
crossing 0 117 24
our 0 117 24
southern 0 117 24
border. 0 117 24

And 0 117 25
even 0 117 25
though 0 117 25
Islamic 0 117 25
jihadis 0 117 25
have 0 117 25
been 0 117 25
apprehended 0 117 25
on 0 117 25
our 0 117 25
border 0 117 25
in 0 117 25
2014, 0 117 25
the 0 117 25
Homeland 0 117 25
Security 0 117 25
waved 0 117 25
their 0 117 25
hand 0 117 25
and 0 117 25
said, 0 117 25
"There's 1 117 25
no 1 117 25
threat." 1 117 25

In 0 117 26
fact, 0 117 26
DHS 0 117 26
had 0 117 26
denied 0 117 26
Muslim 0 117 26
terrorists 0 117 26
were 0 117 26
crossing 0 117 26
the 0 117 26
border, 0 117 26
but 0 117 26
a 0 117 26
local 0 117 26
investigator 0 117 26
produced 0 117 26
evidence 0 117 26
to 0 117 26
the 0 117 26
contrary. 0 117 26

Reports 0 117 27
indicated 0 117 27
that 0 117 27
some 0 117 27
jihadis 0 117 27
were 0 117 27
paying 0 117 27
as 0 117 27
much 0 117 27
as 0 117 27
$50,000 0 117 27
to 0 117 27
get 0 117 27
across 0 117 27

Maury 0 220 45
County 0 220 45
Director 0 220 45
of 0 220 45
Schools, 0 220 45
Chris 0 220 45
Marczak, 0 220 45
defended 0 220 45
the 0 220 45
curriculum: 0 220 45
“It 0 220 45
is 0 220 45
our 0 220 45
job 0 220 45
as 0 220 45
a 0 220 45
public 0 220 45
school 0 220 45
system 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
educate 0 220 45
our 0 220 45
students 0 220 45
on 0 220 45
world 0 220 45
history 0 220 45
in 0 220 45
order 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
be 0 220 45
ready 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
compete 0 220 45
in 0 220 45
a 0 220 45
global 0 220 45
society, 0 220 45
not 0 220 45
to 0 220 45
endorse 0 220 45
one 0 220 45
religion 0 220 45
over 0 220 45
another 0 220 45
or 0 220 45
indoctrinate.” 1 220 45
Porterfield, 0 220 45
however, 0 220 45
shot 0 220 45
back: 0 220 45
“They 0 220 45
are 0 220 45
not 0 220 45
going 0 220 45
over 0 220 45
anything 0 220 45
else. 0 220 45

So 0 220 46
for 0 220 46
the 0 220 46
students 0 220 46
to 0 220 46
have 0 220 46
to 0 220 46
memorize 0 220 46
this 0 220 46
prayer, 0 220 46
it 0 220 46
does 0 220 46
seem 0 220 46
like 0 220 46
it 0 220 46
is 0 220 46
indoctrination.” 1 220 46

None 0 220 47
of 0 220 47
the 0 220 47
encroachments 0 220 47
of 0 220 47
Islam 0 220 47
in 0 220 47
public 0 220 47
schools 0 220 47
should 0 220 47
come 0 220 47
as 0 220 47
any 0 220 47
real 0 220 47
surprise. 0 220 47

Multiculturalism, 0 220 48
after 0 220 48
all, 0 220 48
amounts 0 220 48
to 0 220 48
respect 0 220 48
for 0 220 48
every 0 220 48
culture 0 220 48
except 0 220 48
one’s 0 220 48
own. 0 220 48

The 0 220 49
embarrassment, 0 220 49
regret, 0 220 49
and 0 220 49
even 0 220 49
self-hatred 0 220 49
that 0 220 49
has 0 220 49
been 0 220 49
inculcated 0 220 49
in 0 220 49
American 0 220 49
public 0 220 49
school 0 220 49
students 0 220 49
for 0 220 49
decades 0 220 49
now 0 220 49
has 0 220 49
created 0 220 49
a 0 220 49
vacuum, 0 220 49
which 0 220 49
Muslims 0 220 49
have 0 220 49
shown 0 220 49
themselves 0 220 49
to 0 220 49
be 0 220 49
all 0 220 49
too 0 220 49
eager 0 220 49
to 0 220 49
fill. 0 220 49

Certainly, 0 220 50
those 0 220 50
who 0 220 50
are 0 220 50
furthering 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
Islamization 0 220 50
of 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
schools 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
deny 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
they 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
like 0 220 50
to 0 220 50
see 0 220 50
Islamic 0 220 50
law 0 220 50
implemented 0 220 50
in 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
United 0 220 50
States, 0 220 50
and 0 220 50
would 0 220 50
indignantly 0 220 50
reject 0 220 50
the 0 220 50
claim 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
their 0 220 50
efforts 0 220 50
were 0 220 50
furthering 0 220 50
that 0 220 50
end 0 220 50
in 0 220 50
any 0 220 50
way. 0 220 50

They 0 220 51
would 0 220 51
say 0 220 51
that 0 220 51
they 0 220 51
are 0 220 51
doing 0 220 51
it 0 220 51
all 0 220 51
for 0 220 51
tolerance, 0 220 51
pluralism, 0 220 51
and 0 220 51
multiculturalism. 0 220 51

Unfortunately, 0 220 52
in 0 220 52
the 0 220 52
end, 0 220 52
it 0 220 52
amounts 0 220 52
to 0 220 52
the 0 220 52
same 0 220 52
thing. 0 220 52

only 1 221 4
solution 1 221 4
is 0 221 4
an 0 221 4

An 0 221 5
experimental 0 221 5

is 0 221 5
one 0 221 5
that 0 221 5

never 0 221 5
been 0 221 5

on 0 221 5

before. 0 221 5

Ebola 0 221 6
hemorrhagic 0 221 6
fever, 0 221 6
seen 0 221 6
mostly 0 221 6
only 0 221 6

the 0 221 6
world’s 0 221 6
most 0 221 6
feared 0 221 6

followed 0 221 7
by 0 221 7

vomiting. 0 221 7

Days 0 221 8
later, 0 221 8
some 0 221 8
victims 0 221 8
begin 0 221 8
bleeding 0 221 8
through 0 221 8
the 0 221 8
nose, 0 221 8
mouth, 0 221 8
and 0 221 8

Depending 0 221 9
on 0 221 9
the 0 221 9
strain 0 221 9
of 0 221 9
the 0 221 9
Ebola 0 221 9

it 1 221 9
can 1 221 9
kill 1 221 9
up 1 221 9
to 1 221 9
90% 1 221 9
of 1 221 9
victims. 1 221 9

There 0 221 10
is 0 221 10
no 0 221 10
cure 0 221 10
for 0 221 10
Ebola. 0 221 10

So, 0 221 12
is 0 221 12
the 0 221 12
Ebola 0 221 12

reaching 0 221 12

to 0 221 17

disease 0 221 17
from 0 221 17

beyond 0 221 17
Mbandaka, 0 221 17
which 0 221 17
lies 0 221 17
on 0 221 17

Congo 0 221 17

corridor, 0 221 17
and 0 221 17
is 0 221 17
an 0 221 17
hour’s 0 221 17
flight 0 221 17
from 0 221 17

The 0 221 18
spread 0 221 18
of 0 221 18
Ebola 0 221 18
from 0 221 18
a 0 221 18
rural 0 221 18
area 0 221 18
to 0 221 18
Mbandaka 0 221 18
has 0 221 18
raised 0 221 18
alarm 1 221 18
as 1 221 18
Ebola 1 221 18
can 1 221 18
spread 1 221 18
more 1 221 18
quickly 1 221 18
in 1 221 18
urban 1 221 18
centers. 1 221 18

The 0 221 19
fever 0 221 19
can 0 221 19
cause 0 221 19
severe 0 221 19
internal 0 221 19
bleeding 0 221 19
that 0 221 19
is 0 221 19
often 0 221 19
fatal. 0 221 19

Meaning, 0 221 20
the 0 221 20
virus 0 221 20
itself 0 221 20
doesn’t 0 221 20
actually 0 221 20
kill. 0 221 20

The 0 221 21
immune 0 221 21
system’s 0 221 21
response 0 221 21
to 0 221 21
the 0 221 21
virus 0 221 21
is 0 221 21
what’s 0 221 21
deadly. 0 221 21

ZMapp 0 221 22
is 0 221 22
also 0 221 22
an 0 221 22
experimental 0 221 22
drug 0 221 22
that 0 221 22
could 0 221 22
aid 0 221 22
in 0 221 22
the 0 221 22
recovery 0 221 22
from 0 221 22
the 0 221 22
Ebola 0 221 22
virus. 0 221 22

But, 0 221 23
like 0 221 23
the 0 221 23
vaccine 0 221 23
being 0 221 23
administered, 0 221 23
it 0 221 23
has 0 221 23
not 0 221 23
been 0 221 23
tested 0 221 23
for 0 221 23
safety 0 221 23
or 0 221 23
efficacy 0 221 23
yet. 0 221 23

It 0 221 24
is 0 221 24
not 0 221 24
a 0 221 24
vaccine 0 221 24
– 0 221 24
it 0 221 24
is 0 221 24
a 0 221 24
therapeutic 0 221 24
drug. 0 221 24

Of 0 221 25
the 0 221 25
seven 0 221 25
people 0 221 25
given 0 221 25
the 0 221 25

ruptured 0 223 27
in 0 223 27
1961. 0 223 27

Canada 0 223 28
announced 0 223 28
last 0 223 28
month 0 223 28
that 0 223 28
it 0 223 28
was 0 223 28
bringing 0 223 28
home 0 223 28
the 0 223 28
families 0 223 28
of 0 223 28
its 0 223 28
diplomats 0 223 28
in 0 223 28
Cuba 0 223 28
after 0 223 28
a 0 223 28
year-long 0 223 28
investigation 0 223 28
into 0 223 28
the 0 223 28
illness 0 223 28
failed 0 223 28
to 0 223 28
reveal 0 223 28
a 0 223 28
cause. 0 223 28

"The 0 223 29
cause 0 223 29
(of 0 223 29
their 0 223 29
symptoms) 0 223 29
remains 0 223 29
unknown 0 223 29
but 0 223 29
could 0 223 29
be 0 223 29
human-made," 0 223 29
the 0 223 29
Canadian 0 223 29
government 0 223 29
concluded. 0 223 29

Canadian 0 223 30
and 0 223 30
US 0 223 30
authorities 0 223 30
had 0 223 30
initially 0 223 30
suspected 0 223 30
a 0 223 30
"sonic 0 223 30
attack" 0 223 30
or 0 223 30
a 0 223 30
"mass 0 223 30
psychosomatic 0 223 30
incident", 0 223 30
but 0 223 30
those 0 223 30
are 0 223 30
"now 0 223 30
considered 0 223 30
unlikely", 0 223 30
a 0 223 30
senior 0 223 30
Canadian 0 223 30
official 0 223 30
said. 0 223 30

The 0 223 31
symptoms 0 223 31
included 0 223 31
dizziness, 0 223 31
headaches 0 223 31
and 0 223 31
a 0 223 31
lack 0 223 31
of 0 223 31
ability 0 223 31
to 0 223 31
concentrate. 0 223 31

Unlike 0 223 31

their 0 223 31

counterparts, 0 223 31

however, 0 223 31

no 0 223 31

Pope 0 224 0
Francis 0 224 0
vs 0 224 0
Contemplative 0 224 0
Orders 0 224 0

The 0 224 1
Francis 0 224 1
Vatican’s 0 224 1
approach 0 224 1
to 0 224 1
the 0 224 1
contemplative 0 224 1
life 0 224 1
is 0 224 1
probably 0 224 1
the 0 224 1
most 0 224 1
illustrative 0 224 1
of 0 224 1
our 0 224 1
entire 0 224 1
crisis. 0 224 1

Contemplative 0 224 2
life 0 224 2
is 0 224 2
aimed 0 224 2
only 0 224 2
at 0 224 2
a 0 224 2
purely 0 224 2
supernatural 0 224 2
end. 0 224 2

It 0 224 3
has 0 224 3
no 0 224 3
“use” 0 224 3
in 0 224 3
the 0 224 3
sense 0 224 3
that 0 224 3
either 0 224 3
the 0 224 3
Bergoglians 0 224 3
– 0 224 3
in 0 224 3
terms 0 224 3
of 0 224 3
their 0 224 3
political 0 224 3
machinations 0 224 3
– 0 224 3
or 0 224 3
the 0 224 3
world 0 224 3
can 0 224 3
understand. 0 224 3

There 0 224 4
is 0 224 4
probably 0 224 4
no 0 224 4
other 0 224 4
place 0 224 4
where 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
differences 0 224 4
between 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
two 0 224 4
programmes 0 224 4
- 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
Catholic 0 224 4
programme 0 224 4
of 0 224 4
Christ 0 224 4
and 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
Bergoglian/Kasperian 0 224 4
programme 0 224 4
- 0 224 4
are 0 224 4
more 0 224 4
sharply 0 224 4
contrasted. 0 224 4

One 0 224 5
aspect 0 224 5
of 0 224 5
Pope 0 224 5
Francis’ 0 224 5
character 0 224 5
that 0 224 5
seems 0 224 5
little-explored 0 224 5
by 0 224 5
the 0 224 5
Catholic 0 224 5
and 0 224 5
secular 0 224 5
media 0 224 5
alike 0 224 5
is 0 224 5
his 0 224 5
apparent 0 224 5
disdain 0 224 5
for 0 224 5
contemplative 0 224 5
religious 0 224 5
life 0 224 5
– 0 224 5
a 0 224 5
facet 0 224 5
of 0 224 5
Catholic 0 224 5
life 0 224 5
that 0 224 5
could 0 224 5
be 0 224 5
described 0 224 5
as 0 224 5
the 0 224 5
most 0 224 5
purely 0 224 5
religious 0 224 5
of 0 224 5
all 0 224 5
the 0 224 5
Church’s 0 224 5
undertakings. 0 224 5

The 0 224 6
world 0 224 6
does 0 224 6
not 0 224 6
understand 0 224 6
it 0 224 6
or 0 224 6
want 0 224 6
it. 0 224 6

Therefore, 0 224 7
it 0 224 7
is 0 224 7
something 0 224 7
of 0 224 7
a 0 224 7
thorn 0 224 7
in 0 224 7
the 0 224 7
Bergoglian 0 224 7
side, 0 224 7
and 0 224 7
he 0 224 7
has 0 224 7
repeatedly 0 224 7
expressed 0 224 7
his 0 224 7
contempt 0 224 7
for 0 224 7
it. 0 224 7

So 0 224 8
when, 0 224 8
in 0 224 8
2016 0 224 8
he 0 224 8
issued 0 224 8
a 0 224 8
document 0 224 8
on 0 224 8
contemplative 0 224 8
nuns, 0 224 8
the 0 224 8
faithful 0 224 8
braced 0 224 8
for 0 224 8
impact 0 224 8
. 0 224 8

In 0 224 9
his 0 224 9
recent 0 224 9
document, 0 224 9
ostensibly 0 224 9
on 0 224 9
holiness, 0 224 9
“Gaudete 0 224 9
et 0 224 9
Exultate,” 0 224 9
the 0 224 9
pope 0 224 9
attacked 1 224 9
the 0 224 9
religious 0 224 9
desire 0 224 9
for 0 224 9
silence 0 224 9
and 0 224 9
solitude, 0 224 9
to 0 224 9
be 0 224 9
alone 0 224 9
with 0 224 9
God 0 224 9
in 0 224 9
prayer, 0 224 9
seeking 0 224 9
unity 0 224 9
with 0 224 9
Him, 0 224 9
saying 0 224 9
in 0 224 9
essence 0 224 9
that 0 224 9
the 0 224 9
Christian 0 224 9
life 0 224 9
is 0 224 9
inherently 0 224 9
about 0 224 9
social 0 224 9
activism, 0 224 9
about 0 224 9
material, 0 224 9
worldly 0 224 9
ends. 0 224 9

To 0 224 10
these 0 224 10
foundations 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
the 0 224 10
contemplative 0 224 10
life 0 224 10
– 0 224 10
indeed 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
any 0 224 10
form 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
religious 0 224 10
life 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
the 0 224 10
Church 0 224 10
– 0 224 10
Francis 0 224 10
set 0 224 10
up 0 224 10
another 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
his 0 224 10
false 1 224 10
dichotomies, 0 224 10
contemplation 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
opposition 0 224 10
to 0 224 10
serving 0 224 10
others, 0 224 10
giving 0 224 10
a 0 224 10
Jesuit 0 224 10
maxim 0 224 10
as 0 224 10
an 0 224 10
imperative 0 224 10
for 0 224 10
all 0 224 10
Catholics: 0 224 10
“We 0 224 10
are 0 224 10
called 0 224 10
to 0 224 10
be 0 224 10
contemplatives 0 224 10
even 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
the 0 224 10
midst 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
action, 0 224 10
and 0 224 10
to 0 224 10
grow 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
holiness 0 224 10
by 0 224 10
responsibly 0 224 10
and 0 224 10
generously 0 224 10
carrying 0 224 10
out 0 224 10
our 0 224 10
proper 0 224 10
mission.” 0 224 10

Italian 0 224 11
Vaticanist 0 224 11
Marco 0 224 11
Tosatti 0 224 11
commented 0 224 11
dryly, 0 224 11
“Rejoice 0 224 11
and 0 224 11
be 0 224 11
glad… 0 224 11
but 0 224 11
not 0 224 11
if 0 224 11
you’re 0 224 11
a 0 224 11
cloistered 0 224 11
contemplative.” 0 224 11

In 0 224 12
2016, 0 224 12
I 0 224 12
wrote 0 224 12
that 0 224 12
Francis’ 0 224 12
Apostolic 0 224 12
Constitution, 0 224 12
“Vultum 0 224 12
dei 0 224 12
quaerere” 0 224 12
was 0 224 12
in 0 224 12
some 0 224 12
respects 0 224 12
the 1 224 12
most 1 224 12
damaging 1 224 12
object 0 224 12
of 0 224 12
the 0 224 12
wrecking-ball 1 224 12
pontificate 0 224 12
to 0 224 12
date. 0 224 12

Unfortunately, 0 224 13
it 0 224 13
was 0 224 13
about 0 224 13
a 0 224 13
subject 0 224 13
that 0 224 13
the 0 224 13
world, 0 224 13
and 0 224 13
therefore 0 224 13
the 0 224 13
modern 0 224 13
Church, 0 224 13
cares 0 224 13
so 0 224 13
little 0 224 13
about 0 224 13
that 0 224 13
hardly 0 224 13
anyone 0 224 13
noticed. 0 224 13

Aimed 0 224 14
specifically 0 224 14
at 0 224 14
female 0 224 14
contemplative 0 224 14
religious, 0 224 14
the 0 224 14
document 0 224 14
threatened 0 224 14
that 0 224 14
in 0 224 14
a 0 224 14
year 0 224 14
or 0 224 14
so 0 224 14
another 0 224 14
would 0 224 14
be 0 224 14
forthcoming 0 224 14
laying 0 224 14
out 0 224 14
precisely 0 224 14
what 0 224 14
would 0 224 14
now 0 224 14
be 0 224 14
required 0 224 14
of 0 224 14
nuns 0 224 14
to 0 224 14
continue 0 224 14
in 0 224 14
their 0 224 14
vocations. 0 224 14

The 0 224 15
new 0 224 15
document 0 224 15
issued 0 224 15
last 0 224 15
week, 0 224 15
“Cor 0 224 15
orans,” 0 224 15
is 0 224 15
juridical, 0 224 15
that 0 224 15
is, 0 224 15
it 0 224 15
is 0 224 15
not 0 224 15
much 0 224 15
more 0 224 15
than 0 224 15
a 0 224 15
list 0 224 15
of 0 224 15
specific 0 224 15
norms, 0 224 15
or 0 224 15
rules 0 224 15
– 0 224 15
289 0 224 15
of 0 224 15
them! 0 224 15

– 0 224 16
that 0 224 16
all 0 224 16
communities 0 224 16
of 0 224 16
contemplative 0 224 16
nuns 0 224 16
must 0 224 16
now 0 224 16
follow. 0 224 16

One 0 224 17
odd 0 224 17
remark 0 224 17
in 0 224 17
article 0 224 17
19 0 224 17
is 0 224 17
maybe 0 224 17
the 0 224 17
most 0 224 17
succinct 0 224 17
description 0 224 17
of 0 224 17
the 0 224 17
direction 0 224 17
planned 0 224 17
for 0 224 17
contemplatives: 0 224 17

“A 0 224 18
monastery 0 224 18
of 0 224 18
nuns, 0 224 18
as 0 224 18
every 0 224 18
religious 0 224 18
house, 0 224 18
is 0 224 18
erected 0 224 18
while 0 224 18
keeping 0 224 18
in 0 224 18
mind 0 224 18
its 0 224 18
usefulness 0 224 18
for 0 224 18
the 0 224 18
Church 0 224 18
and 0 224 18
for 0 224 18
the 0 224 18
Institute.” 0 224 18
(emphasis 0 224 18
added) 0 224 18

Wait… 0 224 19
its 0 224 19
“usefulness”? 0 224 19

I 0 224 20
think 0 224 20
a 0 224 20
fair 0 224 20
question 0 224 20
for 0 224 20
the 0 224 20
Faithful 0 224 20
to 0 224 20
ask 0 224 20
this 0 224 20
Vatican 0 224 20
department 0 224 20
might 0 224 20
be, 0 224 20
“According 0 224 20
to 0 224 20
what 0 224 20
specific 0 224 20
criteria 0 224 20
is 0 224 20
a 0 224 20
monastery’s 0 224 20
‘usefulness’ 0 224 20
actually 0 224 20
determined?” 0 224 20

One 0 224 21
can’t 0 224 21
help 0 224 21
but 0 224 21
hearken 0 224 21
back 0 224 21
to 0 224 21
the 0 224 21
criteria 0 224 21
for 0 224 21
monasteries 0 224 21
that 0 224 21
were 0 224 21
allowed 0 224 21
to 0 224 21
survive 0 224 21
the 0 224 21
revolutionary 0 224 21
purges 0 224 21
in 0 224 21
18th 0 224 21
and 0 224 21
19th 0 224 21
century 0 224 21
Europe. 0 224 21

A 0 224 22
house 0 224 22
that 0 224 22
could 0 224 22
prove 0 224 22
to 0 224 22
the 0 224 22
secularists 0 224 22
that 0 224 22
it 0 224 22
was 0 224 22
“useful” 0 224 22
– 0 224 22
that 0 224 22
it 0 224 22
could 0 224 22
care 0 224 22
for 0 224 22
the 0 224 22
indigent 0 224 22
elderly, 0 224 22
teach 0 224 22
children 0 224 22
or 0 224 22
nurse 0 224 22
the 0 224 22
sick 0 224 22
– 0 224 22
would 0 224 22
be 0 224 22
allowed 0 224 22
to 0 224 22
continue. 0 224 22

Those 0 224 23
which 0 224 23
were 0 224 23
purely 0 224 23
contemplative 0 224 23
– 0 224 23
a 0 224 23
single-minded 0 224 23
devotion 0 224 23

God 0 224 23

were 0 224 23
closed. 0 224 23

It 0 224 24
is 0 224 24
not 0 224 24
an 0 224 24
insignificant 0 224 24
quirk 0 224 24
of 0 224 24
modern 0 224 24
history, 0 224 24
and 0 224 24
one 0 224 24
that 0 224 24
tells 0 224 24
us 0 224 24
much 0 224 24
about 0 224 24
the 0 224 24
nature 0 224 24
of 0 224 24
the 0 224 24
current 0 224 24
pontificate, 0 224 24
that 0 224 24
houses 0 224 24
of 0 224 24
contemplatives 0 224 24
are 0 224 24
always 0 224 24
attacked 0 224 24
by 0 224 24
secularist 0 224 24
regimes, 0 224 24
from 1 224 24
Henry 1 224 24
VIII 1 224 24
to 1 224 24
the 1 224 24

Rupture? 0 224 25

What 0 224 26
rupture? 0 224 26

The 0 224 27
first 0 224 27
thing 0 224 27
Cor 0 224 27
orans 0 224 27
does 0 224 27
is 0 224 27
claim 0 224 27
continuity 0 224 27
with 0 224 27
both 0 224 27
pre 0 224 27
and 0 224 27
post-Vatican 0 224 27
II 0 224 27
theology. 0 224 27

In 0 224 28
the 0 224 28
Introduction, 0 224 28
it 0 224 28
seems 0 224 28
anxious 0 224 28
to 0 224 28
establish 0 224 28
a 0 224 28
“hermeneutic 0 224 28
of 0 224 28
continuity” 0 224 28
with 0 224 28
Pius 0 224 28
XII 0 224 28
and 0 224 28
his 0 224 28
document 0 224 28
Sponsa 0 224 28
Christi 0 224 28
Ecclesia 0 224 28
of 0 224 28
1950. 0 224 28

The 0 224 29
authors 0 224 29
insist 0 224 29
there 0 224 29
is 0 224 29
no 0 224 29
contradiction 0 224 29
between 0 224 29
the 0 224 29
two 0 224 29
– 0 224 29
except, 0 224 29
of 0 224 29
course, 0 224 29
where 0 224 29
there 0 224 29
are 0 224 29
contradictions 0 224 29
– 0 224 29
and 0 224 29
that 0 224 29
both 0 224 29
Pius 0 224 29
XII 0 224 29
and 0 224 29
Francis 0 224 29
are 0 224 29
keen 0 224 29
to 0 224 29
see 0 224 29
nuns 0 224 29
reaching 0 224 29
the 0 224 29
“aim 0 224 29
of 0 224 29
their 0 224 29
specific 0 224 29
vocation.” 0 224 29
It 0 224 29
describes 0 224 29
Francis 0 224 29
as 0 224 29
promulgating 0 224 29
this 0 224 29
document 0 224 29
“in 0 224 29
the 0 224 29
wake” 0 224 29
of 0 224 29
Pius 0 224 29
XII[1]. 0 224 29

In 0 224 30
fact, 0 224 30
Pope 0 224 30
Francis, 0 224 30
by 0 224 30
promulgating 0 224 30
the 0 224 30
Apostolic 0 224 30
Constitution 0 224 30
Vultum 0 224 30
Dei 0 224 30
quaerere, 0 224 30
on 0 224 30
June 0 224 30
29, 0 224 30
2016, 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
help 0 224 30
the 0 224 30
contemplatives 0 224 30
reach 0 224 30
the 0 224 30
aim 0 224 30
of 0 224 30
their 0 224 30
specific 0 224 30
vocation, 0 224 30
invited 0 224 30
reflection 0 224 30
and 0 224 30
discernment 0 224 30
on 0 224 30
the 0 224 30
precise 0 224 30
content 0 224 30
tied 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
consecrated 0 224 30
life 0 224 30
in 0 224 30
general 0 224 30
and 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
the 0 224 30
monastic 0 224 30
tradition 0 224 30
in 0 224 30
particular, 0 224 30
but 0 224 30
he 0 224 30
did 0 224 30
not 0 224 30
intend 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
abrogate 0 224 30
Sponsa 0 224 30
Christi 0 224 30
Ecclesia 0 224 30
that 0 224 30
was 0 224 30
derogated 0 224 30
only 0 224 30
in 0 224 30
some 0 224 30
points. 0 224 30

As 0 224 31
a 0 224 31
consequence, 0 224 31
the 0 224 31
two 0 224 31
pontifical 0 224 31
documents 0 224 31
are 0 224 31
to 0 224 31
be 0 224 31
held 0 224 31
as 0 224 31
normative 0 224 31
in 0 224 31
force 0 224 31
for 0 224 31
monasteries 0 224 31
of 0 224 31
nuns 0 224 31
and 0 224 31
must 0 224 31
be 0 224 31
read 0 224 31
in 0 224 31
a 0 224 31
unitary 0 224 31
vision. 0 224 31

But 0 224 32
of 0 224 32
course, 0 224 32
the 0 224 32
entire 0 224 32
game 0 224 32
is 0 224 32
given 0 224 32
away 0 224 32
in 0 224 32
the 0 224 32
next 0 224 32
paragraph: 0 224 32

Pope 0 224 33
Francis, 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
wake 0 224 33
of 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
teaching 0 224 33
of 0 224 33
Pope 0 224 33
Pius 0 224 33
XII 0 224 33
and 0 224 33
reaffirmed 0 224 33
by 0 224 33
Ecumenical 0 224 33
Vatican 0 224 33
Council 0 224 33
II, 0 224 33
intended 0 224 33
to 0 224 33
present 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
Vultum 0 224 33
Dei 0 224 33
quaerere 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
intense 0 224 33
and 0 224 33
fruitful 1 224 33
path 0 224 33
taken 0 224 33
by 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
Church 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
last 0 224 33
decades, 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
light 0 224 33
of 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
teachings 0 224 33
of 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
same 0 224 33
Council 0 224 33
and 0 224 33
considering 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
changed 0 224 33
socio-cultural 0 224 33
conditions. 0 224 33

Yes, 0 224 34
that’s 0 224 34
what 0 224 34
it 0 224 34
said. 0 224 34

Here’s 0 224 35
my 1 224 35
translation: 1 224 35

“The 0 224 36
Church’s 0 224 36
‘path’ 0 224 36
of 0 224 36
the 0 224 36
last 0 224 36
50 0 224 36
years 0 224 36
has 0 224 36
been 0 224 36
‘fruitful’. 1 224 36

How 0 224 37
do 0 224 37
you 0 224 37
know? 0 224 37

Because 0 224 38
we’re 0 224 38
telling 0 224 38
you 0 224 38
it 0 224 38
has.” 0 224 38

In 0 224 39
other 0 224 39
words, 0 224 39
there 0 224 39
have 0 224 39
been 0 224 39
absolutely 1 224 39
no 1 224 39
problems 1 224 39
whatever 1 224 39
with 0 224 39
the 0 224 39
direction 0 224 39
taken 0 224 39
either 0 224 39
by 0 224 39
the 0 224 39
Church 0 224 39
or 0 224 39
by 0 224 39
the 0 224 39
religious 0 224 39
life 0 224 39
since 0 224 39
Vatican 0 224 39
II. 0 224 39

Everything 0 224 40
that 0 224 40
has 0 224 40
happened 0 224 40
has 0 224 40
been 0 224 40
in 0 224 40
complete 1 224 40
and 1 224 40
perfect 1 224 40
continuity 0 224 40
between 0 224 40
the 0 224 40
Before 0 224 40
Church 0 224 40
and 0 224 40
the 0 224 40
After 0 224 40
Church; 0 224 40
there 0 224 40
has 0 224 40
been 0 224 40
no 0 224 40
rupture 0 224 40
or 0 224 40
break 0 224 40
with 0 224 40
the 0 224 40
past. 0 224 40

All 0 224 41
changes 0 224 41
undertaken 0 224 41
by 0 224 41
religious 0 224 41
houses 0 224 41
were 0 224 41
perfectly 1 224 41
legitimate 0 224 41
and 0 224 41
good 0 224 41
- 0 224 41
“fruitful” 1 224 41
if, 0 224 41
perhaps, 0 224 41
a 0 224 41
bit 0 224 41
“intense” 0 224 41
– 0 224 41
and 0 224 41
have 0 224 41
been 0 224 41
made 0 224 41
in 0 224 41
“light 0 224 41
of 0 224 41
the 0 224 41
teachings” 0 224 41
of 0 224 41
Vatican 0 224 41
II 0 224 41
and 0 224 41
“changed 0 224 41
socio-cultural 0 224 41
conditions.” 0 224 41
There 0 224 41
is, 0 224 41
therefore, 0 224 41
no 0 224 41
legitimate 0 224 41
reason 0 224 41
whatever 0 224 41
for 0 224 41
any 0 224 41
religious 0 224 41
house 0 224 41
to 0 224 41
attempt 0 224 41
to 0 224 41
“turn 0 224 41
back 0 224 41
the 0 224 41
clock” 0 224 41
to 0 224 41
the 0 224 41
pre-Vatican 0 224 41
II 0 224 41
norms 0 224 41
or 0 224 41
styles 0 224 41
of 0 224 41
religious 0 224 41
life. 0 224 41

Anyone 1 224 42
attempting 1 224 42
to 1 224 42
do 1 224 42
this 1 224 42
are 1 224 42
Bad 1 224 42
Nuns 1 224 42
[insert 0 224 42
string 0 224 42
of 0 224 42
incomprehensible 0 224 42
papal 0 224 42
insults 0 224 42
here.] 0 224 42

This 0 224 43
is 0 224 43
what 0 224 43
might 0 224 43
be 0 224 43
considered 0 224 43
the 0 224 43
guiding 0 224 43
principle 0 224 43
of 0 224 43
the 0 224 43
document; 0 224 43
“Nothing 0 224 43
to 0 224 43
see 0 224 43
here. 0 224 43

And 0 224 44
if 0 224 44
you 0 224 44
say 0 224 44
there 0 224 44
is, 0 224 44
you’re 0 224 44
the 0 224 44
problem.” 0 224 44

Of 0 224 45
course, 0 224 45
this 0 224 45
kind 0 224 45
of 0 224 45
bold 0 224 45
proclamation 0 224 45
is 0 224 45
very 0 224 45
much 0 224 45
in 0 224 45
keeping 0 224 45
with 0 224 45
the 0 224 45
habit 0 224 45
of 0 224 45
this 0 224 45
pontificate 0 224 45
to 0 224 45
simply 0 224 45
claim 0 224 45
there 0 224 45
are 0 224 45
no 0 224 45
problems 0 224 45
and 0 224 45
become 0 224 45
gravely 1 224 45
offended 1 224 45
and 1 224 45
outraged 1 224 45
when 0 224 45
the 0 224 45
contrary 0 224 45
is 0 224 45
pointed 0 224 45
out. 0 224 45

It’s 0 224 46
your 0 224 46
fault 0 224 46
if 0 224 46
you 0 224 46
find 0 224 46
contradictions, 0 224 46
not 0 224 46
theirs; 0 224 46
they’ve 0 224 46
said 0 224 46
there 0 224 46
are 0 224 46
no 0 224 46
contradictions, 0 224 46
therefore 0 224 46
there 0 224 46
aren’t 0 224 46
any. 0 224 46

After 0 224 47
all, 0 224 47
this 0 224 47
is 0 224 47
the 0 224 47
papacy 0 224 47
where 0 224 47
2 0 224 47
+ 0 224 47
2 0 224 47
= 0 224 47
5 0 224 47
if 0 224 47
the 0 224 47
pope 0 224 47
says 0 224 47
it 0 224 47
does. 0 224 47

The 0 224 48
irony, 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
course, 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
built 0 224 48
in, 0 224 48
since 0 224 48
this 0 224 48
document 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
intended 0 224 48
as 0 224 48
a 0 224 48
legal 0 224 48
chopping 0 224 48
block 0 224 48
for 0 224 48
the 0 224 48
dissolution 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
any 0 224 48
house 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
contemplative 0 224 48
nuns 0 224 48
that 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
judged 0 224 48
to 0 224 48
be 0 224 48
hovering 0 224 48
on 0 224 48
the 0 224 48
edge 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
extinction 1 224 48
or 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
for 0 224 48
some 0 224 48
other 0 224 48
reason 0 224 48
in 0 224 48
need 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
the 0 224 48
chop. 0 224 48

Why 0 224 49
would 0 224 49
the 0 224 49
Vatican 0 224 49
need 0 224 49
a 0 224 49
document 0 224 49
giving 0 224 49
extensive 0 224 49
norms 0 224 49
for 0 224 49
the 0 224 49
closure 0 224 49
of 0 224 49
monasteries 0 224 49
that 0 224 49
have 0 224 49
too 0 224 49
few 0 224 49
nuns 0 224 49
or 0 224 49
do 0 224 49
not 0 224 49
follow 0 224 49
their 0 224 49
originally 0 224 49
intended 0 224 49
charisms 0 224 49
if 0 224 49
everything 0 224 49
about 0 224 49
the 0 224 49
religious 0 224 49
life 0 224 49
since 0 224 49
Vatican 0 224 49
II 0 224 49
has 0 224 49
been 0 224 49
hunky 0 224 49
dory? 0 224 49

Let’s 0 224 50
remember 0 224 50
that 0 224 50
this 0 224 50
comes 0 224 50
from 0 224 50
the 0 224 50
Congregation 0 224 50
for 0 224 50
Religious 0 224 50
of 0 224 50
Braz 0 224 50
de’Aviz 0 224 50
and 0 224 50
Jose 0 224 50
Rodriguez 0 224 50

orienting 0 224 51
himself 0 224 51

He 0 224 52
complained 0 224 52
that 0 224 52

public 0 224 52
point 0 224 52
of 0 224 52
appeasing 0 224 52
and 0 224 52
mollifying 0 224 52
the 1 224 52
most 1 224 52

and 1 224 52

Apparently 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
total 0 224 53
statistical 0 224 53
collapse 0 224 53
of 0 224 53

following 0 224 53
Vatican 0 224 53
II[3] 0 224 53
had 0 224 53
nothing 0 224 53
to 0 224 53
do 0 224 53
with 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
massive 0 224 53
systemic 0 224 53
changes 0 224 53
to 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
forms 0 224 53
of 0 224 53
that 0 224 53
life 0 224 53
– 0 224 53
always 0 224 53
claimed 0 224 53
to 0 224 53
be 0 224 53
“mandated” 0 224 53
by 0 224 53
“the 0 224 53

And 0 224 54
of 0 224 54
course 0 224 54
we 0 224 54
are 0 224 54
talking 0 224 54
about 0 224 54
the 0 224 54

of 0 224 54
a 0 224 54

makes 0 224 54
him 0 224 54
“worry.” 0 224 54
Apparently 0 224 54
this 0 224 54
worry 0 224 54
was 0 224 54
serious 0 224 54
enough 0 224 54
to 0 224 54

him 0 224 54

Autonomy 1 224 55
vs. 0 224 55

Independence 0 224 56

One 0 224 57
of 0 224 57
the 0 224 57
talking 0 224 57
points 0 224 57
the 0 224 57
media 0 224 57
have 0 224 57
latched 0 224 57
onto 0 224 57
is 0 224 57
the 0 224 57
whole 0 224 57
business 0 224 57
of 0 224 57
“autonomy” 1 224 57
of 0 224 57
monasteries. 0 224 57

Many 0 224 58
of 0 224 58
the 0 224 58
headlines 0 224 58
crowed: 0 224 58
“Vatican 0 224 58
confirms 0 224 58
nuns’ 0 224 58
autonomy,” 1 224 58
or 0 224 58
similar. 0 224 58

But 0 224 59
that 0 224 59
word 0 224 59
does 0 224 59
not 0 224 59
mean 0 224 59
what 0 224 59
they 0 224 59
think 0 224 59
it 0 224 59
means. 0 224 59

In 0 224 60
fact, 0 224 60
the 0 224 60
word 0 224 60
“autonomy” 1 224 60
is 0 224 60
the 0 224 60
key 0 224 60
to 0 224 60
understanding 0 224 60
this 0 224 60
whole 0 224 60
thing. 0 224 60

It 0 224 61
appears 0 224 61
in 0 224 61
the 0 224 61
document 0 224 61
16 0 224 61
times 0 224 61
and 0 224 61
“autonomous” 1 224 61
30 0 224 61
times. 0 224 61

In 0 224 62
fact, 0 224 62
“autonomy” 1 224 62
is 0 224 62
held 0 224 62
up 0 224 62
as 0 224 62
the 0 224 62
single 0 224 62
most 0 224 62
important 0 224 62
criterion 0 224 62
for 0 224 62
determining 0 224 62
a 0 224 62
monastery’s 0 224 62
viability. 0 224 62

This 0 224 63
emphasis 0 224 63
is 0 224 63
repeated 0 224 63
so 0 224 63
often 0 224 63
one 0 224 63
might 0 224 63
almost 0 224 63
think 0 224 63
there 0 224 63
is 0 224 63
a 0 224 63
concern 0 224 63
in 0 224 63
Rome 0 224 63
that 0 224 63
the 0 224 63
“fruitful” 1 224 63
post-conciliar 0 224 63
monastic 0 224 63
life 0 224 63
is 0 224 63
in 0 224 63
danger 0 224 63
of 0 224 63
fizzling 0 224 63
out… 0 224 63
for… 0 224 63
some 0 224 63

this 0 224 72

redefining 0 224 72

in 0 224 73
the 0 224 73

was 0 224 73
the 0 224 73
document’s 0 224 73

that 0 224 73
all 0 224 73

we 0 224 74
will 0 224 74
see, 0 224 74
the 0 224 74

now 0 224 74
a 0 224 74

a 0 224 76

that 0 224 76

Note 0 224 77
the 0 224 77
change: 0 224 77
“independent” 0 224 77

replaced 0 224 77
with 0 224 77
“isolated[5].” 0 224 77

had 0 224 77
with 0 224 77
a 0 224 77
superior 0 224 77
of 0 224 77
a 0 224 77
Benedictine 0 224 77
house 0 224 77
in 0 224 77
the 0 224 77
UK. 0 224 77

She 0 224 78
said 0 224 78
she 0 224 78
thought 0 224 78
that 0 224 78
the 0 224 78
psychiatric 0 224 78
testing, 0 224 78
that 0 224 78
in 0 224 78
2008 0 224 78
was 0 224 78
still 0 224 78
all 0 224 78
the 0 224 78
rage 0 224 78
among 0 224 78
the 0 224 78
houses 0 224 78
of 0 224 78
her 0 224 78
monastery’s 0 224 78
federation, 0 224 78
was 0 224 78
excessive 0 224 78
and 0 224 78
not 0 224 78
helpful. 0 224 78

She 0 224 79
didn’t 0 224 79
trust 0 224 79
the 0 224 79
heavily 0 224 79
secularised 0 224 79
field 0 224 79
of 0 224 79
psychology 0 224 79
to 0 224 79
help 0 224 79
in 0 224 79
determining 0 224 79
a 0 224 79
candidate’s 0 224 79
suitability 0 224 79
for 0 224 79
religious 0 224 79
life, 0 224 79
so 0 224 79
she 0 224 79
didn’t 0 224 79
require 0 224 79
these 0 224 79
tests 0 224 79
of 0 224 79
her 0 224 79
monastery’s 0 224 79
postulants. 0 224 79

She 0 224 80
also 0 224 80
said 0 224 80
that 0 224 80
she 0 224 80
was 0 224 80
under 0 224 80
constant 0 224 80
pressure, 0 224 80
both 0 224 80
the 0 224 80
subtle 0 224 80
pressure 0 224 80
of 0 224 80
general 0 224 80
peer 0 224 80
disapproval 0 224 80
and 0 224 80
overt 0 224 80
requests 0 224 80
to 0 224 80
conform 0 224 80
by 0 224 80
the 0 224 80
federation’s 0 224 80
leadership. 0 224 80

Was 0 224 81
that 0 224 81
monastery 0 224 81
“isolated”? 0 224 81

Or 0 224 82
just 0 224 82
exercising 0 224 82
lawful 0 224 82
self-governance? 0 224 82

And 0 224 83
given 0 224 83
that 0 224 83
autonomy 1 224 83
is 0 224 83
being 0 224 83
held 0 224 83
up 0 224 83
as 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
sole 0 224 83
criterion 0 224 83
for 0 224 83
viability 0 224 83
of 0 224 83
a 0 224 83
monastery, 0 224 83
it 0 224 83
seems 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
Holy 0 224 83
See 0 224 83
is 0 224 83
not 0 224 83
interested 0 224 83
in 0 224 83
asking 0 224 83
whether 0 224 83
it 0 224 83
is 0 224 83
actually 0 224 83
faithful 0 224 83
to 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
charism, 0 224 83
or 0 224 83
even 0 224 83
to 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
Catholic 0 224 83
Faith, 0 224 83
a 0 224 83
question 0 224 83
that 0 224 83
has 0 224 83
burned 0 224 83
brightly 0 224 83
for 0 224 83
serious 0 224 83
Catholics 0 224 83
for 0 224 83
some 0 224 83
time. 0 224 83

The 0 224 84
word 0 224 84
“fidelity” 0 224 84
appears 0 224 84
in 0 224 84
the 0 224 84
document 0 224 84
four 0 224 84
times, 0 224 84
which 0 224 84
may 0 224 84
give 0 224 84
an 0 224 84
idea 0 224 84
of 0 224 84
how 0 224 84
much 0 224 84
interest 0 224 84
the 0 224 84
Vatican 0 224 84
has 0 224 84
in 0 224 84
this 0 224 84
issue. 0 224 84

Funny 0 224 85
you 0 224 85
should 0 224 85
mention 0 224 85
autonomy: 1 224 85
Bioethics 0 224 85
and 0 224 85
the 0 224 85
dissolution 0 224 85
of 0 224 85
“unviable” 0 224 85
monasteries 0 224 85

It’s 0 224 86
funny 0 224 86
that 0 224 86
the 0 224 86
buzzword 0 224 86
of 0 224 86
the 0 224 86
day 0 224 86
in 0 224 86
Rome 0 224 86
should 0 224 86
be 0 224 86
“autonomy”. 1 224 86

As 0 224 87
we 0 224 87
shall 0 224 87
see, 0 224 87
the 0 224 87
document 0 224 87
is 0 224 87
what 0 224 87
I’ve 0 224 87
called 0 224 87
above 0 224 87
a 0 224 87
“chopping 0 224 87
block”. 0 224 87

Vultum 0 224 88
dei 0 224 88
quaerere 0 224 88
made 0 224 88
it 0 224 88
clear 0 224 88
that 0 224 88
this 0 224 88
juridical 0 224 88
document 0 224 88
would 0 224 88
provide 0 224 88
a 0 224 88
set 0 224 88
of 0 224 88
legal 0 224 88
criteria 0 224 88
by 0 224 88
which 0 224 88
a 0 224 88
monastery 0 224 88
can 0 224 88
be 0 224 88
considered 0 224 88
viable, 0 224 88
religious 0 224 88
life 0 224 88
worthy 0 224 88
of 0 224 88
life, 0 224 88
so 0 224 88
to 0 224 88
speak, 0 224 88
and 0 224 88
that 0 224 88
those 0 224 88
considered 0 224 88
to 0 224 88
have 0 224 88
failed 0 224 88
the 0 224 88
test 0 224 88
would 0 224 88
be 0 224 88
closed. 0 224 88

Note 0 224 89
the 0 224 89
language 0 224 89
used 0 224 89
here: 0 224 89

If 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
situation 0 224 90
of 0 224 90
incapacity 0 224 90
is 0 224 90
irreversible, 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
solution, 0 224 90
as 0 224 90
painful 0 224 90
as 0 224 90
it 0 224 90
is 0 224 90
necessary, 0 224 90
is 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
suppression 0 224 90
of 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
monastery. 0 224 90

It 0 224 91
jogged 0 224 91
a 0 224 91
memory 0 224 91
for 0 224 91
me. 0 224 91

“Incapacity”… 0 224 92
Where 0 224 92
had 0 224 92
I 0 224 92
heard 0 224 92
that 0 224 92
language 0 224 92
used 0 224 92
before? 0 224 92

Most 0 224 93
pro-life 0 224 93
observers 0 224 93
in 0 224 93
Britain 0 224 93
will 0 224 93
tell 0 224 93
you 0 224 93
that 0 224 93
it 0 224 93
was 0 224 93
the 0 224 93
“Mental 0 224 93
Capacity 0 224 93
Act” 0 224 93
of 0 224 93
2005 0 224 93
that 0 224 93
established 0 224 93
in 0 224 93
British 0 224 93
law 0 224 93
the 0 224 93
concept 0 224 93
that 0 224 93
a 0 224 93
person 0 224 93
with 0 224 93
permanently 0 224 93
“reduced 0 224 93
capacity” 0 224 93
could 0 224 93
be 0 224 93
legally 0 224 93
starved 0 224 93
and/or 0 224 93
dehydrated 0 224 93
to 0 224 93
death 0 224 93
by 0 224 93
doctors. 0 224 93

This 0 224 94
is 0 224 94
the 0 224 94
world, 0 224 94
the 0 224 94
language, 0 224 94
of 0 224 94
Bioethics, 0 224 94
applied 0 224 94
utilitarianism, 0 224 94
also 0 224 94
called 0 224 94
“Principlism” 0 224 94
after 0 224 94
its 0 224 94
three 0 224 94
bioethical 0 224 94
criteria 0 224 94
of 0 224 94
“justice, 0 224 94
beneficence[6] 0 224 94
and 0 224 94
autonomy” 1 224 94
– 0 224 94
it 0 224 94
is 0 224 94
a 0 224 94
patient’s 0 224 94
ability 0 224 94
to 0 224 94
demonstrate 0 224 94
his 0 224 94
“autonomy” 1 224 94
or 0 224 94
“quality 0 224 94
of 0 224 94
life,[7]” 0 224 94
either 0 224 94
currently 0 224 94
or 0 224 94
potentially, 0 224 94
that 0 224 94
decides 0 224 94
his 0 224 94
fate. 0 224 94

This 0 224 95
set 0 224 95
of 0 224 95
criteria 0 224 95
is 0 224 95
being 0 224 95
applied 0 224 95
in 0 224 95
medical 0 224 95
institutions 0 224 95
across 0 224 95
the 0 224 95
western 0 224 95
world 0 224 95
now, 0 224 95
a 0 224 95
“new 0 224 95
paradigm” 0 224 95
of 0 224 95
ethics 0 224 95
replacing 0 224 95
traditional 0 224 95
“Hippocratic” 0 224 95
or 0 224 95
“Natural 0 224 95
Law” 0 224 95
medical 0 224 95
ethics. 0 224 95

Under 0 224 96
this 0 224 96
system 0 224 96
the 0 224 96
onus, 0 224 96
effectively, 0 224 96
is 0 224 96
on 0 224 96
the 0 224 96
patient 0 224 96
to 0 224 96
prove 0 224 96
according 0 224 96
to 0 224 96
the 0 224 96
new 0 224 96
criteria 0 224 96
that 0 224 96
he 0 224 96
is 0 224 96
worthy 0 224 96
of 0 224 96
receiving 0 224 96
medical 0 224 96
treatment 0 224 96
– 0 224 96
of 0 224 96
continuing 0 224 96
to 0 224 96

Medical 0 224 97

(which 0 224 97
legally 0 224 97
includes 0 224 97
food 0 224 97

from 0 224 97
patients 0 224 97
who 0 224 97

that 0 224 97
they 0 224 97
will 0 224 97
recover 0 224 97
sufficiently 0 224 97
to 0 224 97
return 0 224 97

an 0 224 97

If 0 224 100
the 0 224 100

gone 0 224 101
to 0 224 101
court, 0 224 101

has 0 224 102
been 0 224 102
a 0 224 102
quiet 0 224 102

a 0 224 103

all 0 224 104
the 0 224 104

Keep 0 224 105
these 0 224 105
facts 0 224 105
in 0 224 105
mind 0 224 105
as 0 224 105
we 0 224 105
read 0 224 105
through 0 224 105
the 0 224 105
rest 0 224 105
of 0 224 105
the 0 224 105

I 0 224 106
think 0 224 106
we 0 224 106
can 0 224 106
find 0 224 106
an 0 224 106
almost 0 224 106
perfect 0 224 106
analogy 0 224 106
by 0 224 106
replacing 0 224 106
the 0 224 106
term 0 224 106
“patient” 0 224 106
with 0 224 106
“monastery.” 0 224 106
Think 0 224 106
about 0 224 106
how 0 224 106
one 0 224 106
would 0 224 106
apply 0 224 106
concepts 0 224 106
like 0 224 106
“autonomy,” 1 224 106
“viability,” 0 224 106
“incapacity,” 0 224 106
“quality 0 224 106
of 0 224 106
life” 0 224 106
and 0 224 106
“equitable 0 224 106
distribution 0 224 106
of 0 224 106
scarce 0 224 106
resources” 0 224 106
to 0 224 106
this 0 224 106
context. 0 224 106

When 0 224 107
the 0 224 107
language 0 224 107
of 0 224 107

in 0 224 107

one 0 224 107
has 0 224 107
to 0 224 107
wonder 0 224 107
at 0 224 107
what 0 224 107

has 0 224 107
the 0 224 107
entire 0 224 107

needs 0 224 153
of 0 224 153
daily 0 224 153
life. 0 224 153

One 0 224 154
of 0 224 154
these 0 224 154
things 0 224 154
is 0 224 154
not 0 224 154
like 0 224 154
the 0 224 154
others. 0 224 154

Did 0 224 155
you 0 224 155
notice? 0 224 155

One 0 224 156
criterion 0 224 156
stands 0 224 156
out 0 224 156
as 0 224 156
indeterminate, 0 224 156
vague, 0 224 156
compared 0 224 156
with 0 224 156
the 0 224 156
other 0 224 156
concrete 0 224 156
and 0 224 156
measurable 0 224 156
standards. 0 224 156

One 0 224 157
aspect 0 224 157
of 0 224 157
legislative 0 224 157
analysis 0 224 157
that 0 224 157
I 0 224 157
learned 0 224 157
early 0 224 157
was 0 224 157
that 0 224 157
the 0 224 157
terms 0 224 157
used 0 224 157
are 0 224 157
of 0 224 157
utmost 0 224 157
importance. 0 224 157

If 0 224 158
a 0 224 158
term 0 224 158
is 0 224 158
vague 0 224 158
or 0 224 158
is 0 224 158
defined 0 224 158
incorrectly 0 224 158
that 0 224 158
is 0 224 158
a 0 224 158
“loophole”. 0 224 158

Or 0 224 159
it 0 224 159
could 0 224 159
perhaps 0 224 159
be 0 224 159
described 0 224 159
as 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
handle; 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
place 0 224 159
where 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
person 0 224 159
who 0 224 159
wants 0 224 159
to 0 224 159
effect 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
particular 0 224 159
outcome 0 224 159
can 0 224 159
grasp 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
piece 0 224 159
of 0 224 159
legislation 0 224 159
to 0 224 159
use 0 224 159
it 0 224 159
like 0 224 159
an 0 224 159
axe. 0 224 159

So, 0 224 160
how, 0 224 160
exactly, 0 224 160
is 0 224 160
it 0 224 160
to 0 224 160
be 0 224 160
determined 0 224 160
– 0 224 160
and 0 224 160
by 0 224 160
whom 0 224 160
– 0 224 160
that 0 224 160
a 0 224 160
group 0 224 160
of 0 224 160
nuns 0 224 160
possess 0 224 160
“the 0 224 160
necessary 0 224 160

and 0 224 160
transmitting 0 224 160
the 0 224 160
charism”? 0 224 160

What, 0 224 161
precisely, 0 224 161
does 0 224 161
the 0 224 161
term 0 224 161
“vitality” 0 224 161
mean 0 224 161
and 0 224 161
exactly 0 224 161
how 0 224 161
is 0 224 161
one 0 224 161
to 0 224 161
measure 0 224 161
out 0 224 161
how 0 224 161
much 0 224 161
is 0 224 161
required? 0 224 161

Is 0 224 162
this 0 224 162
one 0 224 162
of 0 224 162
Pope 0 224 162
Francis 0 224 162
little 0 224 162
personal, 0 224 162

which 0 224 162
only 0 224 162
he 0 224 162
knows 0 224 162
the 0 224 162
meaning? 0 224 162

Like 0 224 163
the 0 224 163
secret 0 224 163
to 0 224 163
how 0 224 163
nuns 0 224 163
are 0 224 163
to 0 224 163
smile 0 224 163
properly? 0 224 163

Does 0 224 164
the 0 224 164
inclusion 0 224 164
of 0 224 164
completely 0 224 164
subjective 0 224 164
criteria 0 224 164
belong 0 224 164
in 0 224 164
a 0 224 164
juridical 0 224 164
document? 0 224 164

Or 0 224 165
is 0 224 165
it 0 224 165
in 0 224 165
there 0 224 165
in 0 224 165
order 0 224 165
to 0 224 165
provide 0 224 165

for 0 224 165
prelates? 0 224 165

The 0 224 166
next 0 224 166
article 0 224 166
tells 0 224 166
us, 0 224 166
“It 0 224 166
is 0 224 166
the 0 224 166

Do 0 224 166
they 0 224 166

It 0 224 167
seems 0 224 167
important 0 224 167
to 0 224 167
ask 0 224 167

article 0 224 167

the 0 224 168
suppression 0 224 168
of 0 224 168

the 0 224 168

be 0 224 168
considered 0 224 168
as 0 224 168
a 0 224 168
whole: 0 224 168
the 0 224 168

for 0 224 168
government 0 224 168
and 0 224 168

You 0 224 169
will 0 224 169
be 0 224 169
affiliated; 0 224 169
resistance 0 224 169
is 0 224 169
futile… 0 224 169

It 0 224 170
seems 0 224 170
there 0 224 170
are 0 224 170
two 0 224 170
themes 0 224 170
running 0 224 170
through 0 224 170
the 0 224 170
document: 0 224 170
to 0 224 170
establish 0 224 170
a 0 224 170
certain 0 224 170
value 0 224 170
of 0 224 170
“autonomy” 1 224 170
as 0 224 170
the 0 224 170
indispensable 0 224 170
criterion 0 224 170
for 0 224 170
viability, 0 224 170
while 0 224 170
at 0 224 170
the 0 224 170
same 0 224 170
time 0 224 170
asserting 0 224 170
top-down 0 224 170

to 0 224 170
make 0 224 170
this 0 224 170
determination. 0 224 170

In 0 224 171
short, 0 224 171
a 0 224 171
monastery 0 224 171
must 0 224 171
be 0 224 171
autonomous, 1 224 171
but 0 224 171
heaven 0 224 171
help 0 224 171
the 0 224 171

that 0 224 171

its 0 224 171
independence. 0 224 171

the 0 224 172

starting 0 224 179

that 0 224 182
clearly 0 224 182
the 0 224 182

the 0 224 183
manner 0 224 183
this 0 224 183

house 0 224 183

the 0 224 183
Netherlands 0 224 183
whose 0 224 183
superior, 0 224 183
unsurprisingly, 0 224 183
discovered 0 224 183
that 0 224 183
the 0 224 183
house 0 224 183
was 0 224 183
hopelessly 0 224 183
divided 0 224 183

could 0 224 183
not 0 224 183

seem, 0 224 191

that 0 224 191

a 0 224 191
careful 0 224 191

it 0 224 192
might 0 224 192
be 0 224 192
helpful 0 224 192

to 0 224 201

to 0 224 201

Shortly 0 224 202
after 0 224 202
Carballo’s 0 224 202
appointment, 0 224 202
it 0 224 202
was 0 224 202
revealed 0 224 202
that 0 224 202
the 0 224 202
Swiss 0 224 202

Carballo 0 224 203
was 0 224 203
Francis’ 0 224 203
very 0 224 203
first 0 224 203
appointment, 0 224 203
April 0 224 203
6, 0 224 203
2013, 0 224 203
three 0 224 203
weeks 0 224 203
after 0 224 203
the 0 224 203
Conclave 0 224 203
and 0 224 203
it 0 224 203
was 0 224 203
to 0 224 203
him 0 224 203
that 0 224 203
the 0 224 203
pope 0 224 203
gave 0 224 203
the 0 224 203
task 0 224 203
of 0 224 203
the 0 224 203
destruction 0 224 203
of 0 224 203

a 0 224 203
major 0 224 203
part 0 224 203
of 0 224 203
that 0 224 203

separate 0 224 203

from 0 224 203

30 0 224 203
million 0 224 203
Euros. 0 224 203

So 0 224 204
much 0 224 204
for 0 224 204
the 0 224 204
principle 0 224 204
of 0 224 204
subsidiarity. 0 224 204

I 0 224 205
can 0 224 205
imagine 0 224 205
what 0 224 205
a 0 224 205

founded 0 224 205
by 0 224 205
a 0 224 205

as 0 230 35
they 0 230 35
were 0 230 35
for 0 230 35
Islam. 0 230 35

This 0 230 36
actually 0 230 36
further 0 230 36
proves 0 230 36
my 0 230 36
point 0 230 36
that 0 230 36
Islam 0 230 36
was 0 230 36
afforded 0 230 36
special 0 230 36
privilege 0 230 36
over 0 230 36
the 0 230 36
others. 0 230 36

The 0 230 37
school 0 230 37
is 0 230 37
backtracking 0 230 37
and 0 230 37
being 0 230 37
deceptive 0 230 37
to 0 230 37
try 0 230 37
and 0 230 37
weasel 0 230 37
out 0 230 37
of 0 230 37
this. 0 230 37

The 0 230 38
teacher 0 230 38

clarified 0 230 38
things 0 230 38
for 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
students 0 230 38
but 0 230 38
that 0 230 38
still 0 230 38
does 0 230 38
not 0 230 38
excuse 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
fact 0 230 38
that 0 230 38
they 0 230 38
are 0 230 38
teaching 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
Islamic 0 230 38
faith 0 230 38
and 0 230 38
asking 0 230 38
the 0 230 38
kids 0 230 38
to 0 230 38
participate 0 230 38
in 0 230 38
Sharia. 0 230 38

Look 0 230 39
at 0 230 39
the 0 230 39
Islamic 0 230 39

again. 0 230 39

They 0 230 40
are 0 230 40
asking 0 230 40

the 0 230 40

The 0 230 41
teacher 0 230 41
still 0 230 41
has 0 230 41
not 0 230 41
corrected 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
error 0 230 41
that 0 230 41
calligraphy 0 230 41
was 0 230 41
started 0 230 41
by 0 230 41
the 0 230 41
arabs. 0 230 41

They 0 230 42
are 0 230 42
doubling 0 230 42
down 0 230 42
and 0 230 42
only 0 230 42
after 0 230 42
being 0 230 42
called 0 230 42
on 0 230 42
it 0 230 42
are 0 230 42

it 0 230 52
gets 0 230 52
even 0 230 52
worse. 0 230 52

Rich 0 230 53
Penkoski 0 230 53
has 0 230 53
alerted 0 230 53
me 0 230 53
to 0 230 53

What 0 230 54
do 0 230 54
they 0 230 54

Apparently, 0 230 55
a 0 230 55

Worse 0 230 56
still, 0 230 56

Unidentified 0 230 58
“adult 0 230 58

He 0 230 59
sent 0 230 59
this 0 230 59
message 0 230 59
to 0 230 59
me: 0 230 59

A 0 230 60
student 0 230 60
in 0 230 60
the 0 230 60
school 0 230 60
threatened 1 230 60
to 0 230 60

and 0 230 60
kill 1 230 60
me 0 230 60
by 0 230 60
stabbing 0 230 60
me 0 230 60
in 0 230 60
the 0 230 60
chest 0 230 60
and 0 230 60
ripping 1 230 60
my 1 230 60
organs 1 230 60
out. 1 230 60

They 0 230 61
told 0 230 61
my 0 230 61
daughter 0 230 61
“we 0 230 61
are 0 230 61
gonna 0 230 61

people 0 230 61
and 0 230 61
kill 1 230 61
your 0 230 61

This 0 230 61
student, 0 230 61
who 0 230 61
is 0 230 61
known 0 230 61
to 0 230 61
me 0 230 61
but 0 230 61
whom 0 230 61
I 0 230 61
cannot 0 230 61
name 0 230 61
because 0 230 61
she 0 230 61
is 0 230 61
a 0 230 61
minor, 0 230 61
has 0 230 61
given 0 230 61
students 0 230 61
our 0 230 61
address 0 230 61
and 0 230 61
is 0 230 61
encouraging 0 230 61
them 0 230 61
to 0 230 61
come 0 230 61
to 0 230 61
my 0 230 61
home 0 230 61
over 0 230 61
this 0 230 61
whole 0 230 61
thing. 0 230 61

Another 0 230 62
student 0 230 62
told 0 230 62
my 0 230 62
daughter 0 230 62
that 0 230 62
she 0 230 62
and 0 230 62
the 0 230 62
first 0 230 62
student 0 230 62
and 0 230 62
her 0 230 62
adult 0 230 62
friends 0 230 62
are 0 230 62
going 0 230 62
to 0 230 62
kill 1 230 62
me 0 230 62
and 0 230 62
carve 0 230 62
a 0 230 62
satanic 1 230 62
star 0 230 62
in 0 230 62
my 0 230 62
chest 0 230 62
and 0 230 62
rip 1 230 62
out 1 230 62
my 1 230 62
organs. 1 230 62

They 0 230 63
then 0 230 63
threatened 1 230 63
to 0 230 63
hang 1 230 63
my 1 230 63
3-year-old 1 230 63
and 1 230 63
1-year-old 1 230 63
and 1 230 63
kidnap 1 230 63
my 1 230 63
14-year-old. 1 230 63

All 0 230 64
this 0 230 64
in 0 230 64
school 0 230 64
today 0 230 64
because 0 230 64
of 0 230 64
the 0 230 64
articles. 0 230 64

This 0 230 65
is 0 230 65
not 0 230 65
a 0 230 65
joke 0 230 65
and 0 230 65
needs 0 230 65
to 0 230 65
be 0 230 65
investigated. 0 230 65

I 0 230 66
have 0 230 66
contacted 0 230 66
the 0 230 66
school’s 0 230 66
principal, 0 230 66
Dr. 0 230 66

Branch, 0 230 67
and 0 230 67
I 0 230 67
trust 0 230 67
that 0 230 67
he 0 230 67
will 0 230 67
take 0 230 67
this 0 230 67
matter 0 230 67
seriously 0 230 67
and 0 230 67
deal 0 230 67
with 0 230 67
it 0 230 67
appropriately. 0 230 67

Is 1 230 68
the 1 230 68
principal 1 230 68
acting 1 230 68
on 1 230 68
this? 1 230 68

And 1 230 69
do 1 230 69
the 1 230 69
police 1 230 69
have 1 230 69
any 1 230 69
interest 1 230 69
in 1 230 69
this? 1 230 69

Or 1 230 70
would 1 230 70
that 1 230 70
be 1 230 70
“islamofauxbic”? 1 230 70

The 0 231 11
Daily 0 231 11
Mail 0 231 11
reported 0 231 11
that 0 231 11
one 0 231 11
diplomat 0 231 11
described 0 231 11
being 0 231 11
jolted 0 231 11
awake 0 231 11
in 0 231 11
a 0 231 11
Havana 0 231 11
hotel 0 231 11

by 0 231 11
a 0 231 11
grinding, 0 231 11
blaring 0 231 11
cacophony. 0 231 11

When 0 231 12
he 0 231 12
moved 0 231 12
a 0 231 12
few 0 231 12
feet 0 231 12
across 0 231 12
the 0 231 12
room, 0 231 12
the 0 231 12
noise 0 231 12
stopped. 0 231 12

When 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
got 0 231 13
back 0 231 13
into 0 231 13
bed, 0 231 13
the 0 231 13
agonizing 1 231 13
sound 0 231 13
hit 0 231 13
him 0 231 13
again; 0 231 13
as 0 231 13
if, 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
told 0 231 13
doctors, 0 231 13
he 0 231 13
had 0 231 13
walked 0 231 13
through 0 231 13
some 0 231 13
invisible 0 231 13
wall 0 231 13
cutting 0 231 13
straight 0 231 13
down 0 231 13
the 0 231 13
middle 0 231 13
of 0 231 13
his 0 231 13
room. 0 231 13

Whether 0 231 14
they 0 231 14
heard 0 231 14
anything 0 231 14
or 0 231 14
not, 0 231 14
the 0 231 14
consequences 0 231 14
have 0 231 14
been 0 231 14
unmistakable 0 231 14
— 0 231 14
symptoms 0 231 14
ranging 0 231 14
from 0 231 14
nosebleeds, 0 231 14
nausea, 0 231 14
dizziness 0 231 14
and 0 231 14
severe 0 231 14
headaches 0 231 14

Oddly, 0 231 15

as 0 231 15
some 0 231 15

Islam’s 1 234 19

the 1 234 19
latter 1 234 19

During 0 234 20

generous 0 234 21
and 0 234 21
kind 0 234 21
toward 0 234 21
their 0 234 21
fellow 0 234 21
Muslims. 0 234 21

However, 0 234 22
the 0 234 22
Qur’an 0 234 22
says: 0 234 22
“Muhammad 0 234 22
is 0 234 22
the 0 234 22
Messenger 0 234 22
of 0 234 22
Allah, 0 234 22
and 0 234 22
those 0 234 22
who 0 234 22
are 0 234 22
with 0 234 22
him 0 234 22
are 0 234 22
severe 1 234 22
against 1 234 22
disbelievers, 0 234 22
and 0 234 22
merciful 0 234 22
among 0 234 22
themselves” 0 234 22
(48:29). 0 234 22

If 0 234 23
the 0 234 23
Ramadan 0 234 23
imperative 0 234 23
is 0 234 23
to 0 234 23
become 0 234 23
more 0 234 23
devout, 0 234 23
the 0 234 23
Muslim 0 234 23
who 0 234 23
applies 0 234 23
himself 0 234 23
diligently 0 234 23
to 0 234 23
the 0 234 23
Ramadan 0 234 23
observance 0 234 23
will 0 234 23
simultaneously 0 234 23
become 0 234 23
more 0 234 23
both 0 234 23
merciful 0 234 23
to 0 234 23
his 0 234 23
fellow 0 234 23
Muslims 0 234 23
and 0 234 23
more 1 234 23
severe 1 234 23
against 1 234 23
the 0 234 23
unbelievers. 0 234 23

Murdering 1 234 24
infidels 1 234 24
thus 1 234 24
doesn’t 1 234 24
contradict 1 234 24
the 1 234 24
spirit 1 234 24
of 1 234 24
Ramadan; 1 234 24
it 1 234 24
embodies 1 234 24
it. 1 234 24

was 0 234 25
a 0 234 25
month 0 234 25
of 0 234 25
forthcoming. 0 234 25

The 0 234 26
greatest 0 234 26

during 0 234 26
the 0 234 26
lifetime 0 234 26

of 1 234 26

zeal 0 234 26
and 0 234 26
enthusiasm.” 0 234 26

Trump 0 234 27
was, 0 234 27
unfortunately, 0 234 27
following 0 234 27
the 0 234 27
example 0 234 27
of 0 234 27
his 0 234 27
two 0 234 27
immediate 0 234 27
predecessors 0 234 27
when 0 234 27
he 0 234 27
claimed 0 234 27
that 0 234 27
“Ramadan 0 234 27
reminds 0 234 27
us 0 234 27
of 0 234 27
the 0 234 27
richness 0 234 27
Muslims 0 234 27
add 0 234 27
to 1 234 27
the 1 234 27
religious 1 234 27
tapestry 1 234 27
of 1 234 27
American 1 234 27
life,” 1 234 27
and 0 234 27
was 0 234 27
severely 1 234 27
misleading 1 234 27
the 1 234 27
American 1 234 27
people. 1 234 27

Ironically, 0 234 28
even 0 234 28
in 0 234 28
doing 0 234 28
this 0 234 28
he 0 234 28
is 0 234 28
likely 0 234 28
to 0 234 28
fail 0 234 28
to 0 234 28
satisfy 0 234 28
Muslims, 0 234 28
or 0 234 28
anyone. 0 234 28

After 0 234 29
all, 0 234 29
after 0 234 29
the 0 234 29
Trump 0 234 29
White 0 234 29
House 0 234 29
issued 0 234 29
a 0 234 29
similar 0 234 29
statement 0 234 29
last 0 234 29
year, 0 234 29
the 0 234 29
Washington 0 234 29
Post 0 234 29
ran 0 234 29
a 0 234 29
lengthy 0 234 29
piece 0 234 29
in 0 234 29
which 0 234 29
several 0 234 29
Muslims 0 234 29
explained 0 234 29
why 0 234 29
the 0 234 29
statement 0 234 29
was 0 234 29
unsatisfactory 0 234 29
to 0 234 29
them. 0 234 29

Shadi 0 234 30
Hamid 0 234 30
of 0 234 30
the 0 234 30
Qatar-funded 0 234 30
Brookings 0 234 30
Institution 0 234 30
declared: 0 234 30
“Trump 1 234 30
has 1 234 30
so 1 234 30
rarely 1 234 30
recognized 1 234 30
that 1 234 30
American 1 234 30
Muslims 1 234 30
even 1 234 30
exist, 1 234 30
but 1 234 30
this 1 234 30
offers 1 234 30
apparent 1 234 30
proof 1 234 30
that 1 234 30
he 1 234 30
is 1 234 30
aware 1 234 30
of 1 234 30
our 1 234 30
existence. 1 234 30

Great! 1 234 31

Putting 0 234 32
all 0 234 32
that 0 234 32
context 0 234 32
aside, 0 234 32
it’s 0 234 32
offensive 0 234 32
and 0 234 32
pretty 1 234 32
much 1 234 32
terrible.” 1 234 32

Why? 0 234 33

Because 0 234 34
Trump 0 234 34
had 0 234 34
the 0 234 34
temerity 0 234 34
to 0 234 34
mention 0 234 34
jihad 0 234 34
terrorism. 0 234 34

Hamid 0 234 35
continued: 0 234 35
“We, 0 234 35
as 0 234 35
American 0 234 35
Muslims, 0 234 35
shouldn’t 0 234 35
be 0 234 35
defined 0 234 35
solely 0 234 35
in 0 234 35
our 0 234 35
relationship 0 234 35
to 0 234 35
bad 0 234 35
things 0 234 35
that 0 234 35
we 0 234 35
have 0 234 35
nothing 0 234 35
to 0 234 35
do 0 234 35
with. 0 234 35

We’re 0 234 36
also 0 234 36
normal 0 234 36
people 0 234 36
who 0 234 36
happen 0 234 36
to 0 234 36
be 0 234 36
Muslim 0 234 36
and 0 234 36
to 0 234 36
see 0 234 36
us 0 234 36
and 0 234 36
our 0 234 36
history 0 234 36
in 0 234 36
America 0 234 36
so 0 234 36
narrowly 0 234 36
is 0 234 36
plain 1 234 36
out 1 234 36
offensive.” 1 234 36

What 1 234 37
is 1 234 37
actually 1 234 37
offensive 1 234 37
is 1 234 37
that 1 234 37
Hamid 1 234 37
would 1 234 37
try 1 234 37
in 1 234 37
this 1 234 37
way 1 234 37
to 1 234 37
absolve 1 234 37
the 1 234 37
Muslim 1 234 37
community 1 234 37
of 1 234 37
any 1 234 37
responsibility 1 234 37
to 1 234 37
root 1 234 37
out 1 234 37
jihad 1 234 37
terrorist 1 234 37
from 1 234 37
its 1 234 37
midst. 1 234 37

There 0 234 38
is 0 234 38
certain 0 234 38
to 0 234 38
be 0 234 38
more 0 234 38
jihad 0 234 38
terrorism 0 234 38
during 0 234 38
this 0 234 38
Ramadan, 0 234 38
and 0 234 38
some 0 234 38
of 0 234 38
it 0 234 38
may 0 234 38
be 0 234 38
committed 0 234 38
by 0 234 38
Muslims 0 234 38
in 0 234 38
the 0 234 38
U.S. 0 234 38
Hamid, 1 234 38
if 1 234 38
he 1 234 38
cared 1 234 38
about 1 234 38
this, 1 234 38
would 1 234 38
be 1 234 38
confronting 1 234 38
honestly 1 234 38
the 1 234 38
teachings 1 234 38
of 1 234 38
Islam 1 234 38
that 1 234 38
make 1 234 38
Ramadan 1 234 38
the 1 234 38
month 1 234 38
of 1 234 38
jihad, 1 234 38
and 1 234 38
working 1 234 38
to 1 234 38
reform 1 234 38
them. 1 234 38

Meanwhile, 0 234 39
it 1 234 39
would 1 234 39
be 1 234 39
dangerous, 1 234 39
suicidal 1 234 39
folly 1 234 39
for 1 234 39
Infidels 1 234 39
to 1 234 39
pretend 1 234 39
that 1 234 39
Ramadan 1 234 39
is 1 234 39
not 1 234 39
the 1 234 39
month 1 234 39
of 1 234 39
jihad. 1 234 39

And 1 234 40
as 1 234 40
our 1 234 40
Ramadan 1 234 40
willful 1 234 40
blindness 1 234 40
continues, 1 234 40
more 1 234 40
Infidels 1 234 40
will 1 234 40
die. 1 234 40

this 0 235 6

of 0 235 12

the 0 235 16

marching 0 235 16
orders. 0 235 16

This 0 235 17
is 0 235 17

programme: 0 235 17

“Do 0 235 18
not 0 235 18

sooner 1 235 18
or 1 235 18
later, 1 235 18
they 1 235 18
will 1 235 18
die. 1 235 18

They 0 235 19
will 0 235 19
not 0 235 19

breathing 0 235 22
this 0 235 22

are 0 235 22
fundamentally 0 235 22

Carmel 0 235 42

Sister 0 235 43
T. 0 235 43
continued, 0 235 43
saying 0 235 43
that 0 235 43
the 0 235 43
document 0 235 43
explicitly 0 235 43
derogates 0 235 43
the 0 235 43
founding 0 235 43
intentions 0 235 43
of 0 235 43
St. 0 235 43
Teresa 0 235 43
for 0 235 43
whom 0 235 43
real 0 235 43
autonomy 0 235 43
was 0 235 43
a 0 235 43
crucial 0 235 43
element 0 235 43
of 0 235 43
her 0 235 43
Carmelite 0 235 43
reform. 0 235 43

She 0 235 44
acknowledges 0 235 44
that 0 235 44
cloistered 0 235 44
orders 0 235 44
of 0 235 44
nuns 0 235 44
have 0 235 44
for 0 235 44
some 0 235 44
time 0 235 44
been 0 235 44
gathered 0 235 44
into 0 235 44
federations. 0 235 44

These 0 235 45
are 0 235 45
already 0 235 45
doing 0 235 45
the 0 235 45
Cor 0 235 45
orans 0 235 45
programme, 0 235 45
having 0 235 45
shared 0 235 45
initial 0 235 45
formation 0 235 45
programmes 0 235 45
for 0 235 45
postulants 0 235 45
and 0 235 45
novices, 0 235 45
“ongoing 0 235 45
formation” 0 235 45
courses 0 235 45
for 0 235 45
professed 0 235 45
nuns, 0 235 45
a 0 235 45
federal 0 235 45
abbess 0 235 45
or 0 235 45
president 0 235 45
who 0 235 45
oversees 0 235 45
all 0 235 45
the 0 235 45
federated 0 235 45
monasteries. 0 235 45

Their 0 235 46
funds 0 235 46
are 0 235 46
already 0 235 46
interconnected 0 235 46
and 0 235 46
they 0 235 46
have 0 235 46
regular 0 235 46
meetings 0 235 46
with 0 235 46
and 0 235 46
input 0 235 46
from 0 235 46
the 0 235 46
male 0 235 46
branches. 0 235 46

In 0 235 47
2015, 0 235 47
Carmelite 0 235 47
monasteries 0 235 47
received 0 235 47
a 0 235 47
questionnaire 0 235 47
from 0 235 47
the 0 235 47
Father 0 235 47
General 0 235 47
Fr. 0 235 47

Saverio 0 235 48
Cannistra, 0 235 48
a 0 235 48
Mexican 0 235 48
and 0 235 48
devotee 0 235 48
of 0 235 48
Liberation 0 235 48
Theology, 0 235 48
to 0 235 48
ask 0 235 48
if 0 235 48
they 0 235 48
wanted 0 235 48
an 0 235 48
International 0 235 48
Commission 0 235 48
of 0 235 48
Nuns 0 235 48
to 0 235 48
oversee 0 235 48
the 0 235 48
female 0 235 48
houses 0 235 48
place 0 235 48
of 0 235 48
the 0 235 48
Carmelite 0 235 48
Fathers. 0 235 48

This 0 235 49
suggestion 0 235 49
was 0 235 49
rejected, 0 235 49
to 0 235 49
the 0 235 49
annoyance 0 235 49
of 0 235 49
Maccise. 0 235 49

Maccise 0 235 50
also 0 235 50
promoted 0 235 50
the 0 235 50
idea 0 235 50
of 0 235 50
having 0 235 50
no 0 235 50
superiors 0 235 50
in 0 235 50
the 0 235 50
individual 0 235 50
monasteries, 0 235 50
but 0 235 50
only 0 235 50
federation 0 235 50
presidents 0 235 50
and 0 235 50
shared 0 235 50
formation 0 235 50
of 0 235 50
novices. 0 235 50

The 0 235 51
push 0 235 51
for 0 235 51
these 0 235 51
changes 0 235 51
is 0 235 51
still 0 235 51
on, 0 235 51
however, 0 235 51
under 0 235 51
the 0 235 51
current 0 235 51
General, 0 235 51
an 0 235 51
Italian, 0 235 51
Saverio 0 235 51
Cannistrà. 0 235 51

Given 0 235 52
the 0 235 52
Marxist 0 235 52
leanings 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
the 0 235 52
recent 0 235 52
crop 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
Fathers 0 235 52
General, 0 235 52
it 0 235 52
seems 0 235 52
clear 0 235 52
that 0 235 52
what 0 235 52
can 0 235 52
be 0 235 52
expected 0 235 52
by 0 235 52
“ongoing 0 235 52
formation” 0 235 52
is, 0 235 52
in 0 235 52
essence, 0 235 52
some 0 235 52
form 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
political 0 235 52
indoctrination, 0 235 52
sprayed 0 235 52
over 0 235 52
with 0 235 52
a 0 235 52
micro-thin 0 235 52
layer 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
pious 0 235 52
language. 0 235 52

But 0 235 53
for 0 235 53
Carmelite 0 235 53
nuns, 0 235 53
Sister 0 235 53
said, 0 235 53
these 0 235 53
ideas 0 235 53
are 0 235 53
the 0 235 53
antithesis 0 235 53
of 0 235 53
the 0 235 53
intentions 0 235 53
of 0 235 53
St. 0 235 53
Teresa. 0 235 53

Authentic 0 235 54
autonomy, 0 235 54
independence 0 235 54
of 0 235 54
formation 0 235 54
and 0 235 54
finances, 0 235 54
“are 0 235 54
essential 0 235 54
points 0 235 54
of 0 235 54
our 0 235 54
charism 0 235 54
that 0 235 54
Our 0 235 54
Holy 0 235 54

do 0 235 54
away 0 235 54
with 0 235 54

“They 0 235 55
go 0 235 55
against 0 235 55

even 0 235 55
though 0 235 55
Cor 0 235 55

states 0 235 55
that 0 235 55
everything 0 235 55

not 0 235 56

Formation 0 235 57

specifically 0 235 59
set 0 235 59
up 0 235 59

that 0 235 59

now 0 235 60
it’s 0 235 60
going 0 235 60

She 0 235 61
points 0 235 61
to 0 235 61
the 0 235 61
extended 0 235 61

of 0 235 61

Cor 0 235 61
orans 0 235 61
now 0 235 61
nine 0 235 61

as 0 235 61
absurd, 1 235 61
saying 0 235 61
it 0 235 61
will 0 235 61
tend 0 235 61
to 0 235 61

“As 0 235 62

Our 0 235 63

a 0 235 63
three 0 235 63

dissuade 0 235 63

It 0 235 64
will 0 235 64
also 0 235 64
help 0 235 64
the 0 235 64
monastery 0 235 64

Another 0 236 27
feature 0 236 27
of 0 236 27
my 1 236 27
curriculum 1 236 27
is 0 236 27
that 0 236 27
it 0 236 27
provides 0 236 27
students 0 236 27
the 0 236 27
opportunity 0 236 27
to 0 236 27
create 0 236 27

The 0 236 28
government 0 236 28
and 0 236 28
history 0 236 28
sections 0 236 28
of 0 236 28
the 0 236 28
curriculum 0 236 28
emphasize 0 236 28
Austrian 0 236 28
economics, 0 236 28
libertarian 0 236 28
political 0 236 28
theory, 0 236 28
and 0 236 28
the 0 236 28
history 0 236 28
of 0 236 28
liberty. 0 236 28

However, 0 236 29
unlike 0 236 29
government 0 236 29
schools, 0 236 29
my 1 236 29
curriculum 1 236 29
never 0 236 29
puts 0 236 29
ideological 0 236 29
indoctrination 1 236 29
ahead 0 236 29
of 0 236 29
education. 0 236 29

While 0 236 30
government 0 236 30
schools 0 236 30
— 0 236 30
and 0 236 30
even 0 236 30
many 0 236 30
private 0 236 30
schools 0 236 30
— 0 236 30
pretend 0 236 30
religion 0 236 30
played 0 236 30
no 0 236 30
significant 0 236 30
role 0 236 30
in 0 236 30
history, 0 236 30
my 1 236 30
curriculum 1 236 30
addresses 0 236 30
the 0 236 30
crucial 1 236 30
role 0 236 30
religion 0 236 30
played 0 236 30
in 0 236 30
the 0 236 30
development 0 236 30
of 0 236 30
Western 0 236 30

However, 0 236 31
the 0 236 31
materials 0 236 31
are 0 236 31
drafted 0 236 31
in 0 236 31
such 0 236 31
a 0 236 31
way 0 236 31
that 0 236 31
any 0 236 31

or 0 236 31

reason 0 236 34
many 0 236 34
parents 0 236 34
are 0 236 34
considering 0 236 34

it 0 236 34
is 0 236 34
not 0 236 34
the 0 236 34
only 0 236 34
reason. 0 236 34

Many 0 236 35

are 0 236 35
motivated 0 236 35
by 0 236 35
a 0 236 35

"There 1 240 2
is 1 240 2
no 1 240 2
Republican 1 240 2
Party. 1 240 2

There's 1 240 3
a 1 240 3
Trump 1 240 3
party," 1 240 3
John 0 240 3
Boehner 0 240 3
told 0 240 3
a 0 240 3
Mackinac, 0 240 3
Michigan, 0 240 3
gathering 0 240 3
of 0 240 3

"The 0 240 4
Republican 0 240 4
Party 0 240 4
is 0 240 4
kind 0 240 4
of 0 240 4
taking 0 240 4
a 0 240 4
nap 0 240 4
somewhere." 0 240 4

Ex-Speaker 0 240 5
Boehner 0 240 5
should 0 240 5
probably 0 240 5
re-check 0 240 5
the 0 240 5
old 0 240 5
party's 0 240 5
pulse, 0 240 5
for 0 240 5
the 0 240 5
Bush-Boehner 0 240 5
GOP 0 240 5
may 0 240 5
not 0 240 5
just 0 240 5
be 0 240 5
napping. 0 240 5

It 0 240 6
could 0 240 6
be 0 240 6
comatose. 1 240 6

Consider. 0 240 7

That 0 240 8
GOP 0 240 8
was 0 240 8
dedicated 0 240 8
to 0 240 8
free 0 240 8
trade, 0 240 8
open 0 240 8
borders, 0 240 8
amnesty 0 240 8
and 0 240 8
using 0 240 8
U.S. 0 240 8
power 0 240 8
to 0 240 8
punish 1 240 8
aggressors 1 240 8
and 0 240 8
"end 1 240 8
tyranny 1 240 8
in 1 240 8
our 1 240 8
world." 1 240 8

That 0 240 9
GOP 0 240 9
set 0 240 9
out 0 240 9
to 0 240 9
create 0 240 9
a 0 240 9
new 0 240 9
world 0 240 9
order 0 240 9
where 0 240 9
dictatorships 0 240 9
were 0 240 9
threatened 0 240 9
with 0 240 9
"regime 0 240 9
change," 0 240 9
and 0 240 9
democratic 0 240 9
capitalism 0 240 9
was 0 240 9
the 0 240 9
new 0 240 9
order 0 240 9
of 0 240 9
the 0 240 9
ages. 0 240 9

Yet, 0 240 10
Donald 0 240 10
Trump 0 240 10
captured 0 240 10
the 0 240 10
Republican 0 240 10
nomination 0 240 10
and 0 240 10
won 0 240 10
the 0 240 10
presidency—by 0 240 10
saying 0 240 10
goodbye 0 240 10
to 0 240 10
all 0 240 10
that. 0 240 10

How 0 240 11
probable 0 240 11
is 0 240 11
it 0 240 11
that 0 240 11
a 0 240 11
future 0 240 11
GOP 0 240 11
presidential 0 240 11

will 0 240 11
revive 0 240 11
the 0 240 11
Bush-Boehner 0 240 11
agenda 0 240 11
the 0 240 11
party 0 240 11

it, 0 240 11

it 0 240 11
on 0 240 11
the 0 240 11
party 0 240 11
and 0 240 11
nation? 0 240 11

Bush-Boehner 0 240 12
Republicanism 0 240 12
appears 0 240 12
to 0 240 12
be 0 240 12
as 0 240 12
dead 1 240 12
today 0 240 12
as 0 240 12
was 0 240 12
Harding-Coolidge 0 240 12
Republicanism 0 240 12
after 0 240 12
1933. 0 240 12

And 0 240 13
if 1 240 13
Trumpism 1 240 13
is 1 240 13
not 1 240 13
the 1 240 13
future 1 240 13
of 1 240 13
the 1 240 13
GOP, 1 240 13
it 1 240 13
is 1 240 13
hard 1 240 13
to 1 240 13
see 1 240 13
what 1 240 13
a 1 240 13
promising 1 240 13
GOP 1 240 13
agenda 1 240 13
might 1 240 13
look 1 240 13

A 0 240 14
brief 0 240 14
history: 0 240 14
In 0 240 14
seven 0 240 14
elections 0 240 14
starting 0 240 14
in 0 240 14
1992, 0 240 14
Republicans 0 240 14
won 0 240 14
the 0 240 14
presidency 0 240 14
three 0 240 14
times, 0 240 14
but 0 240 14
the 0 240 14
popular 0 240 14
vote 0 240 14
only 0 240 14
once, 0 240 14
in 0 240 14
2004, 0 240 14
when 0 240 14
George 0 240 14
W. 0 240 14
was 0 240 14
still 0 240 14
basking 0 240 14
in 0 240 14
his 0 240 14
"Mission 0 240 14
Accomplished" 0 240 14
in 0 240 14
Iraq. 0 240 14

What 0 240 15
fractured 0 240 15
and 0 240 15
overwhelmed 0 240 15
the 0 240 15
Bush-Boehner 0 240 15
Republican 0 240 15
Party? 0 240 15

First, 0 240 16
demography. 0 240 16

The 0 240 17
mass 0 240 17
immigration 0 240 17
of 0 240 17
Third 0 240 17
World 0 240 17
peoples 0 240 17
that 0 240 17
began 0 240 17
with 0 240 17
the 0 240 17
1965 0 240 17
immigration 0 240 17
act, 0 240 17
and 0 240 17
the 0 240 17
decline 0 240 17
in 0 240 17
the 0 240 17
birth 0 240 17
rate 0 240 17
of 0 240 17
native-born 0 240 17
Americans, 0 240 17
began 0 240 17
to 0 240 17
swamp 0 240 17
the 0 240 17
Nixon-Reagan 0 240 17
New 0 240 17
Majority. 0 240 17

Second, 0 240 18
the 0 240 18
collapse 0 240 18
of 0 240 18
the 0 240 18
Soviet 1 240 18
Empire 1 240 18
and 0 240 18
USSR 0 240 18
removed 0 240 18
the 0 240 18

Eisenhower 0 240 18
to 0 240 18
Bush 0 240 18
I—the 0 240 18
Cold 0 240 18
War. 0 240 18

After 0 240 19
the 0 240 19
Red 0 240 19
Army 0 240 19
went 0 240 19
home, 0 240 19
"America 1 240 19
First" 1 240 19
had 0 240 19
a 0 240 19
new 0 240 19
appeal! 0 240 19

Third, 0 240 20
faithful 0 240 20
to 0 240 20
the 0 240 20
free 0 240 20
trade 0 240 20
cult 1 240 20
in 0 240 20
which 0 240 20
they 0 240 20
were 0 240 20
raised, 0 240 20
Republicans 0 240 20
championed 0 240 20
NAFTA, 0 240 20
the 0 240 20
WTO, 0 240 20
and 0 240 20
MFN 0 240 20

China. 0 240 20

Historians 0 240 21
will 0 240 21
look 0 240 21
back 0 240 21
in 0 240 21
amazement 0 240 21
at 0 240 21
how 0 240 21
America's 0 240 21
free 0 240 21
trade 0 240 21
zealots 1 240 21
gave 0 240 21
away 0 240 21
the 0 240 21
greatest 0 240 21
manufacturing 0 240 21
base 0 240 21
the 0 240 21
world 0 240 21
had 0 240 21
ever 0 240 21
seen, 0 240 21
as 0 240 21
they 0 240 21
quoted 0 240 21
approvingly 0 240 21
18th- 0 240 21
and 0 240 21
19th-century 0 240 21
scribblers 0 240 21
whose 0 240 21
ideas 0 240 21
had 0 240 21
done 0 240 21
so 0 240 21
much 0 240 21
to 0 240 21
bring 0 240 21
down 0 240 21
their 1 240 21
own 1 240 21
country, 1 240 21
Great 1 240 21
Britain. 1 240 21

Between 0 240 22
1997 0 240 22
and 0 240 22
2017, 0 240 22
the 0 240 22
EU 0 240 22
ran 0 240 22
up, 0 240 22
at 0 240 22
America's 0 240 22
expense, 0 240 22
trade 0 240 22
surpluses 0 240 22
in 0 240 22
goods 0 240 22
in 0 240 22
excess 0 240 22
of 0 240 22
$2 0 240 22
trillion, 0 240 22
while 0 240 22
we 0 240 22
also 0 240 22
picked 0 240 22
up 0 240 22
the 0 240 22
bill 0 240 22
for 0 240 22
Europe's 0 240 22
defense. 0 240 22

Between 0 240 23
1992 0 240 23
and 0 240 23
2016, 0 240 23
China 1 240 23
was 1 240 23
allowed 1 240 23
to 1 240 23
run 1 240 23
$4 1 240 23
trillion 1 240 23
in 1 240 23
trade 1 240 23
surpluses 1 240 23
at 1 240 23
our 1 240 23
expense, 1 240 23
converting 1 240 23
herself 1 240 23
into 1 240 23
the 1 240 23
world's 1 240 23
first 1 240 23
manufacturing 1 240 23
power 1 240 23
and 1 240 23
denuding 1 240 23
America 1 240 23
of 1 240 23
tens 1 240 23
of 1 240 23
thousands 1 240 23
of 1 240 23
factories 1 240 23
and 1 240 23
millions 1 240 23
of 1 240 23
manufacturing 1 240 23
jobs. 1 240 23

In 0 240 24
Trump's 0 240 24
first 0 240 24
year, 0 240 24
China's 0 240 24
trade 0 240 24
surplus 0 240 24
with 0 240 24
the 0 240 24
United 0 240 24
States 0 240 24
hit 0 240 24
$375 0 240 24
billion. 0 240 24

From 0 240 25
January 0 240 25
to 0 240 25
March 0 240 25
of 0 240 25
this 0 240 25
year, 0 240 25
our 0 240 25
trade 0 240 25
deficit 0 240 25
with 0 240 25
China 0 240 25
was 0 240 25
running 0 240 25
at 0 240 25
close 0 240 25
to 0 240 25
the 0 240 25
same 0 240 25
astronomical 0 240 25
rate. 0 240 25

"Trade 0 240 26
deficits 0 240 26
do 0 240 26
not 0 240 26
matter," 0 240 26
we 0 240 26
hear 0 240 26
from 0 240 26
the 0 240 26
economists. 0 240 26

They 0 240 27
might 0 240 27
explain 0 240 27
that 0 240 27
to 0 240 27
Ohio, 0 240 27
Michigan 0 240 27
and 0 240 27
Pennsylvania. 0 240 27

And 0 240 28
perhaps 0 240 28
someone 0 240 28
can 0 240 28
explain 0 240 28
the 0 240 28
wisdom 0 240 28
of 0 240 28
handing 0 240 28
4 0 240 28
percent 0 240 28
of 0 240 28
our 0 240 28
GDP 0 240 28
each 0 240 28
year 0 240 28
to 0 240 28
an 0 240 28
adversary 0 240 28
nation, 0 240 28
as 0 240 28
U.S. 0 240 28
admirals 0 240 28
talk 0 240 28
tough 0 240 28
about 0 240 28
confronting 0 240 28
that 0 240 28
adversary 0 240 28
nation 0 240 28
over 0 240 28
islets 0 240 28
and 0 240 28
reefs 0 240 28
in 0 240 28
the 0 240 28
South 0 240 28
China 0 240 28
Sea. 0 240 28

Why 0 240 29
are 0 240 29
we 0 240 29
enriching 0 240 29
and 0 240 29
empowering 0 240 29
so 0 240 29
exorbitantly 0 240 29
those 0 240 29
whom 0 240 29
we 0 240 29
are 0 240 29
told 0 240 29
we 0 240 29
may 0 240 29
have 0 240 29
to 0 240 29
fight? 0 240 29

Fourth, 0 240 30
under 0 240 30
Bush 0 240 30
II 0 240 30
and 0 240 30
Obama, 0 240 30
the 0 240 30
U.S. 0 240 30
intervened 0 240 30
massively 0 240 30
in 0 240 30
the 0 240 30
Near 0 240 30
and 0 240 30
Middle 0 240 30
East—in 0 240 30
Afghanistan, 0 240 30
Iraq, 0 240 30
Libya, 0 240 30
Syria, 0 240 30
Yemen. 0 240 30

And 0 240 31
the 0 240 31
forces 0 240 31
that 0 240 31
pushed 0 240 31
up 0 240 31
into 0 240 31
those 0 240 31
conflicts, 0 240 31
and 0 240 31
so 1 240 31
disillusioned 1 240 31
the 1 240 31
nation 1 240 31
that 1 240 31
it 1 240 31
elected 1 240 31
Barack 1 240 31
Obama, 1 240 31
are 0 240 31
back, 0 240 31
pushing 0 240 31
for 0 240 31
a 0 240 31
new 0 240 31
war, 0 240 31
on 0 240 31
Iran. 0 240 31

They 0 240 32
may 0 240 32
get 0 240 32
this 0 240 32
war, 0 240 32
too. 0 240 32

Yet, 0 240 33
given 0 240 33
the 0 240 33
anti-interventionist 0 240 33
and 0 240 33
anti-war 0 240 33
stance 0 240 33
of 0 240 33
Trump's 0 240 33
winning 0 240 33
campaign, 0 240 33
and 0 240 33
of 0 240 33
the 0 240 33
Bernie 0 240 33
Sanders 0 240 33
campaign, 0 240 33
U.S. 0 240 33
involvement 0 240 33
in 0 240 33
Middle 0 240 33
East 0 240 33
wars 0 240 33
seems 0 240 33
less 0 240 33
America's 0 240 33
future 0 240 33
than 0 240 33
it 0 240 33
does 0 240 33
her 0 240 33
past. 0 240 33

After 0 240 34
his 0 240 34
16 0 240 34
months 0 240 34
in 0 240 34
office, 0 240 34
it 0 240 34
appears 0 240 34
as 0 240 34
though 0 240 34
the 0 240 34
Trump 0 240 34

The 0 240 35
world 0 240 35

changing. 0 240 35

NATO 0 240 36

Nationalism, 0 240 37
populism 0 240 37
and 0 240 37

are 0 240 37
pervasive 0 240 37
on 0 240 37
the 0 240 37

And 0 240 38
America's 0 240 38

It 0 240 39
is 0 240 39
hard 0 240 39
to 0 240 39
see 0 240 39
why 0 240 39
or 0 240 39
how 0 240 39
Republicans 0 240 39
are 0 240 39
ever 0 240 39

the 0 240 39

What 0 240 40
would 0 240 40
be 0 240 40
the 0 240 40
argument 0 240 40
for 0 240 40
returning 0 240 40

Putin 0 240 41

Russia 0 240 41
that 0 240 41
was 0 240 41
a 0 240 41
rejection 0 240 41
of 0 240 41

the 0 240 41
Bush-Boehner 0 240 41
Party 0 240 41
had 0 240 41
stood 0 240 41

If 0 240 42
the 0 240 42

It's 0 241 9
no 0 241 9
wonder 0 241 9
the 0 241 9
establishment 0 241 9
is 0 241 9

Trump 0 241 10
"dangerous 1 241 10
to 1 241 10
our 1 241 10

But 0 241 11
the 0 241 11
real 0 241 11
threat 0 241 11
Trump 0 241 11
represents 0 241 11
is 0 241 11
to 0 241 11
the 0 241 11
GOP 0 241 11
establishment's 0 241 11
control 0 241 11
of 0 241 11

U.S. 0 241 12
politics 0 241 12
have 0 241 12
indeed 0 241 12
been 0 241 12
coarsened, 0 241 12
with 0 241 12
Trump 0 241 12
playing 0 241 12
a 0 241 12
lead 0 241 12
role. 0 241 12

Yet, 0 241 13
beneath 0 241 13
the 0 241 13
savagery 1 241 13

personal 0 241 13
insults 0 241 13

personality 0 241 13
clashes. 0 241 13

This 0 241 14
is 0 241 14
a 0 241 14
struggle 0 241 14
about 0 241 14
policy, 0 241 14
about 1 241 14
the 1 241 14
future. 1 241 14

And 0 241 15
Trump 1 241 15
is 1 241 15
president 1 241 15
because 1 241 15
he 1 241 15
read 1 241 15
the 1 241 15
party 1 241 15
and 1 241 15
the 1 241 15
country 1 241 15
right, 1 241 15
while 0 241 15
the 0 241 15
Bush-McCain 0 241 15
Republican 0 241 15
establishment 0 241 15
had 0 241 15

Times 0 241 33
recognized 0 241 33
Trump's 0 241 33
triumph: 1 241 33

"Despite 0 241 34
the 0 241 34
fervor 0 241 34
of 0 241 34
President 0 241 34
Trump's 0 241 34
Republican 0 241 34
opponents, 0 241 34
the 0 241 34
president's 0 241 34
brand 0 241 34
of 0 241 34
hard-edged 1 241 34
nationalism—with 0 241 34

taking 0 241 34
root 0 241 34
within 0 241 34
his 0 241 34

party." 0 241 34

Moreover, 0 241 35
a 0 241 35
new 0 241 35
question 0 241 35
arises: 0 241 35

Can 0 241 36
the 0 241 36
GOP 0 241 36
establishment 0 241 36
believe 0 241 36
that 0 241 36
if 0 241 36
Trump 0 241 36
falls, 0 241 36
or 0 241 36
they 0 241 36
bring 0 241 36
him 0 241 36
down, 0 241 36
they 0 241 36
will 0 241 36
inherit 0 241 36
the 0 241 36
estate 0 241 36
and 0 241 36
be 0 241 36
welcomed 0 241 36
home 0 241 36
like 0 241 36
the 0 241 36
Prodigal 1 241 36
Son? 1 241 36

Do 1 241 37
they 1 241 37
believe 1 241 37
their 1 241 37
old 1 241 37
agenda 1 241 37
of 1 241 37
open 1 241 37
borders, 1 241 37
amnesty, 1 241 37
free 1 241 37
trade 1 241 37
globalism 1 241 37
and 1 241 37
democracy-crusading 1 241 37
can 1 241 37
become 1 241 37
America's 1 241 37
agenda 1 241 37
again? 1 241 37

Trumpism 1 241 38
is 0 241 38
not 0 241 38
a 0 241 38
detour, 0 241 38
after 0 241 38
which 0 241 38
we 0 241 38
can 0 241 38
all 0 241 38
get 0 241 38
back 0 241 38
on 0 241 38
the 0 241 38
interstate 0 241 38
to 0 241 38
the 0 241 38
New 0 241 38
World 0 241 38
Order. 0 241 38

For 0 241 39
though 0 241 39
unpleasant, 0 241 39
it 0 241 39
is 0 241 39
not 0 241 39
unfair 0 241 39
to 0 241 39
say 0 241 39
that 0 241 39
if 0 241 39
there 0 241 39
was 0 241 39
one 0 241 39
desire 0 241 39
common 0 241 39
to 0 241 39
Bernie 0 241 39
Sanders, 0 241 39
Ted 0 241 39
Cruz 0 241 39
and 0 241 39
Donald 0 241 39
Trump 0 241 39
voters, 0 241 39
it 0 241 39
was 0 241 39
be 0 241 39
rid 0 241 39
of 0 241 39
the 0 241 39
regime 0 241 39
resting 0 241 39
on 0 241 39
top 0 241 39
of 0 241 39
all 0 241 39
of 0 241 39
us. 0 241 39

Should 1 241 40
Trump 1 241 40
fall, 1 241 40
and 1 241 40
a 1 241 40
restored 1 241 40
establishment 1 241 40
attempt 1 241 40
to 1 241 40
reimpose 1 241 40
the 1 241 40
old 1 241 40
policies, 1 241 40
there 1 241 40
will 1 241 40
be 1 241 40
a 1 241 40
truly 1 241 40
uncivil 1 241 40
war 1 241 40
in 1 241 40
this 1 241 40
country. 1 241 40

After 1 241 41
the 1 241 41
Trumpian 1 241 41
revolt, 1 241 41
there 1 241 41
is 1 241 41
no 1 241 41
going 1 241 41
back. 1 241 41

As 0 241 42
that 0 241 42
most 1 241 42
American 1 241 42
of 1 241 42
writers, 1 241 42
Thomas 0 241 42
Wolfe, 0 241 42
put 0 241 42
it, 0 241 42
"You 0 241 42
can't 0 241 42
go 0 241 42
home 0 241 42
again." 0 241 42

Traditionalists 0 241 43
have 0 241 43
been 0 241 43
told 0 241 43
that 0 241 43
for 0 241 43
years. 0 241 43

Now 0 241 44
it's 0 241 44
the 0 241 44
turn 0 241 44
of 0 241 44
the 0 241 44
GOP 0 241 44
establishment 0 241 44
to 0 241 44
learn 0 241 44
the 0 241 44
truth 0 241 44
as 0 241 44
well. 0 241 44

Goldwater 0 241 45
lost 0 241 45
badly, 0 241 45
but 0 241 45
the 0 241 45
establishment 0 241 45
that 0 241 45
abandoned 0 241 45
him 0 241 45
never 0 241 45

“It 0 245 25

lawyer, 0 245 25
Greg 0 245 25

said. 0 245 25

“It’s 0 245 26
a 0 245 26
very 0 245 26
sad 0 245 26
case 0 245 26
because 0 245 26
Kristian 0 245 26
Saucier 0 245 26
is 0 245 26
a 1 245 26
fine 1 245 26

man. 1 245 26

We 0 245 27
don’t 0 245 27
believe 0 245 27
this 0 245 27
was 0 245 27
really 0 245 27
his 0 245 27
true 0 245 27
character.” 0 245 27

“My 0 245 28
case 0 245 28
was 0 245 28
usually 0 245 28
something 0 245 28
handled 0 245 28
by 0 245 28
military 0 245 28

Saucier 0 245 28
said. 0 245 28

“They 1 245 29
used 1 245 29
me 1 245 29
as 1 245 29
an 1 245 29
example 1 245 29
because 1 245 29
of 1 245 29
[the 1 245 29
backlash 1 245 29
over] 1 245 29
Hillary 1 245 29
Clinton,” 1 245 29
he 0 245 29
continued, 0 245 29
alleging 0 245 29
his 0 245 29
life 0 245 29
was 0 245 29
ruined 0 245 29
for 0 245 29
political 0 245 29
reasons. 0 245 29

President 0 245 30
Trump 0 245 30
had 0 245 30
spoken 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
his 0 245 30
support 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
Saucier 0 245 30
on 0 245 30
the 0 245 30
campaign 0 245 30
trail 0 245 30
and 0 245 30
blasted 0 245 30
the 0 245 30
Obama 0 245 30
administration's 0 245 30
handling 0 245 30
of 0 245 30
his 0 245 30
case. 0 245 30

“With 0 245 31
a 0 245 31
pardon, 0 245 31
there’s 0 245 31
no 0 245 31
magic 0 245 31
wand 0 245 31
that 0 245 31
gets 0 245 31
waved 0 245 31
and 0 245 31
makes 0 245 31
everything 0 245 31
right,” 0 245 31
Saucier 0 245 31
said, 0 245 31
“But 0 245 31
I 0 245 31
try 0 245 31
to 0 245 31
stay 0 245 31
positive 0 245 31
and 0 245 31
look 0 245 31

That's 0 245 32
a 0 245 32
good 0 245 32
attitude 0 245 32
considering 0 245 32
he 0 245 32
has 0 245 32
had 0 245 32

a 0 245 32
tremendous 1 245 32
amount 0 245 32
of 0 245 32

due 0 245 32
to 0 245 32

So, 0 246 30
expose 1 246 30
the 1 246 30
Islamists 1 246 30
fro 1 246 30
who 1 246 30
and 1 246 30
what 1 246 30
they 1 246 30
are 1 246 30
and 1 246 30
what 1 246 30
Islam's 1 246 30
founder 1 246 30
not 1 246 30
only 1 246 30
taught 1 246 30
them, 1 246 30
but 1 246 30
modeled 1 246 30
for 1 246 30
them, 1 246 30
and 0 246 30
you 0 246 30
may 0 246 30
just 0 246 30
find 0 246 30
yourself 0 246 30
in 0 246 30
jail 0 246 30
in 0 246 30
the 0 246 30
UK. 0 246 30

Sadly, 0 246 31
the 0 246 31
same 0 246 31
scenario 0 246 31
is 0 246 31
making 0 246 31
some 0 246 31
strides 0 246 31
in 0 246 31
the 0 246 31

Dutch 0 246 32
MP 0 246 32

he 0 246 32

join 0 246 32
those 0 246 32

Wilders 0 246 33
has 0 246 33
called 0 246 33
Robinson's 0 246 33
imprisonment 0 246 33
a 0 246 33
"disgrace." 1 246 33

He 0 246 34
told 0 246 34
Breitbart: 0 246 34

Tommy 0 246 35
Robinson 0 246 35

25 0 246 35
outside 0 246 35
Leeds 0 246 35

He 0 246 36
was 0 246 36
arrested, 0 246 36
brought 0 246 36
before 0 246 36
a 0 246 36
judge, 0 246 36
and 0 246 36
sentenced 0 246 36
within 0 246 36
five 0 246 36

The 0 246 37

his 0 246 37

even 0 246 37
forcing 0 246 37
British 0 246 37

their 0 246 37

about 0 246 37
the 0 246 37

Such 1 246 38
measures 1 246 38
are 1 246 38
common 1 246 38
practice 1 246 38
in 1 246 38
North 1 246 38
Korea 1 246 38
and 1 246 38
Saudi 1 246 38

It 0 246 39
is 0 246 39
sad 0 246 39
to 0 246 39
see 0 246 39
how 0 246 39
Britain, 0 246 39
the 0 246 39

the 0 246 39

is 0 246 39
fast 0 246 39
descending 1 246 39

tyranny. 1 246 39

Tommy 1 246 40
is 1 246 40
a 1 246 40
hero. 1 246 40

It 0 246 41
is 0 246 41
a 0 246 41

that 0 246 41

A 0 248 1
rough 0 248 1
patch—or 0 248 1
a 0 248 1
double-dip 0 248 1
recession? 0 248 1

Economists 0 248 2
are 0 248 2
increasingly 1 248 2
befuddled 1 248 2
at 0 248 2
what 0 248 2
awaits 0 248 2
the 0 248 2

And 0 248 3
Wall 0 248 3

is 0 248 3
plainly 0 248 3
beginning 0 248 3
to 0 248 3
panic. 0 248 3

Unemployment 0 248 4
is 0 248 4
a 0 248 4
case 0 248 4
in 0 248 4
point. 0 248 4

It 0 248 5
now 0 248 5
seems 0 248 5
obvious 0 248 5
that 0 248 5
one 0 248 5
of 0 248 5
those 0 248 5
mysterious 1 248 5
memos 1 248 5
has 0 248 5
gone 0 248 5

to 0 248 5
the 0 248 5

mention 0 248 5
the 0 248 5

solution. 0 248 5

But 0 248 6
unemployment 0 248 6
is 0 248 6
befuddling 0 248 6
anyway. 0 248 6

Just 0 248 7
a 0 248 7
few 0 248 7
weeks 0 248 7
ago 0 248 7
professional 0 248 7

the 0 248 8

that 0 248 10

back 0 248 20
further 0 248 20
and 0 248 20
the 1 248 20

is 1 248 20
still 1 248 20
bleaker. 1 248 20

Since 0 248 21

a 0 248 22

Simply 1 248 23
put, 1 248 23
the 1 248 23
21st 1 248 23
century 1 248 23
has 1 248 23
not 1 248 23

for 1 248 23
non-Hispanic 1 248 23

This 0 248 24
Hispanic/non-Hispanic 0 248 24
divide 0 248 24
was, 0 248 24
of 0 248 24

a 0 248 24

of 0 248 25

because 0 248 25
the 0 248 25

declined 0 248 25

lack 0 74 6

of 0 74 6
this 0 74 6

One 0 74 7
source 0 74 7
is 0 74 7
Paul 0 74 7
Ryan: 0 74 7
Evidence: 0 74 7
“House 0 74 7
Speaker 0 74 7
Paul 0 74 7
Ryan 0 74 7
said 0 74 7
Wednesday 0 74 7
that 0 74 7
Oversight 0 74 7
Chairman 0 74 7
Trey 0 74 7
Gowdy 0 74 7
was 0 74 7
‘accurate’ 0 74 7
when 0 74 7
he 0 74 7
argued 0 74 7
the 0 74 7
FBI 0 74 7
has 0 74 7
acted 0 74 7
appropriately 0 74 7
in 0 74 7
its 0 74 7
ongoing 0 74 7
probe 0 74 7
of 0 74 7
potential 0 74 7
Russian 0 74 7
links 0 74 7
to 0 74 7
the 0 74 7
Trump 0 74 7
campaign.” 0 74 7
How 1 74 7
could 1 74 7
Ryan 1 74 7
possibly 1 74 7
know 1 74 7
this? 1 74 7

Isn’t 1 74 8
he 1 74 8
prejudging 1 74 8
the 1 74 8
case 1 74 8
without 1 74 8
even 1 74 8
finding 1 74 8
out 1 74 8
what 1 74 8
actually 1 74 8
happened? 1 74 8

If 0 74 9
Ryan 0 74 9
is 0 74 9
correct, 0 74 9
an 0 74 9
investigation 0 74 9
will 0 74 9
show 0 74 9
it; 0 74 9
but 0 74 9
the 0 74 9
current 0 74 9
evidence 0 74 9
suggests 0 74 9
he 0 74 9
is 0 74 9
wrong. 0 74 9

By 0 74 10
short-circuiting 0 74 10
the 0 74 10
investigation, 0 74 10
Ryan 0 74 10
is 0 74 10
betraying 1 74 10
the 1 74 10
interest 1 74 10
of 1 74 10
the 1 74 10
American 1 74 10
people 1 74 10
to 0 74 10
learn 0 74 10
what 0 74 10
the 0 74 10
FBI 0 74 10
and 0 74 10
CIA 0 74 10
actually 0 74 10
did 0 74 10
against 0 74 10
Trump. 0 74 10

Another 0 74 11
Republican 0 74 11
who 0 74 11
wants 0 74 11
to 0 74 11
stop 0 74 11

is 0 74 11
former 0 74 11
RNC 0 74 11

Michael 0 74 11
Steele: 0 74 11
“There 0 74 11
is 0 74 11
no 0 74 11

because 0 74 11
there 0 74 11
are 0 74 11
no 0 74 11
spies 0 74 11
in 0 74 11
the 0 74 11

The 0 74 11
attitude 0 74 11
of 0 74 11
Steve 0 74 11
Scalise 0 74 11
is 0 74 11
wishy-washy. 1 74 11

He’s 0 74 12
open 0 74 12
to 0 74 12
a 0 74 12
special 0 74 12
prosecutor, 0 74 12
but 0 74 12
his 0 74 12
responses 0 74 12
come 0 74 12
across 0 74 12
as 0 74 12
passive, 0 74 12
lacking 1 74 12
push, 1 74 12
zeal 1 74 12
and 1 74 12
enthusiasm 1 74 12
to 0 74 12
delve 0 74 12

But 0 251 2
this 0 251 2
is 0 251 2
a 0 251 2
case 0 251 2
where 0 251 2
Obama 0 251 2
Inc. 0 251 2
tried 0 251 2
to 0 251 2
get 0 251 2
them 0 251 2

While 0 251 3
they 0 251 3
did 0 251 3
the 0 251 3

thing. 0 251 3

The 0 251 4
Obama 0 251 4
administration 0 251 4
secretly 0 251 4
sought 0 251 4
to 0 251 4
give 0 251 4
Iran 0 251 4
access 0 251 4
— 0 251 4
albeit 0 251 4
briefly 0 251 4
— 0 251 4
to 0 251 4
the 0 251 4
U.S. 0 251 4
financial 0 251 4
system 0 251 4
by 0 251 4
sidestepping 0 251 4
sanctions 0 251 4
kept 0 251 4
in 0 251 4
place 0 251 4
after 0 251 4
the 0 251 4
2015 0 251 4
nuclear 0 251 4
deal, 0 251 4
despite 0 251 4
repeatedly 0 251 4
telling 0 251 4
Congress 0 251 4
and 0 251 4
the 0 251 4
public 0 251 4
it 0 251 4
had 0 251 4
no 0 251 4
plans 0 251 4
to 0 251 4
do 0 251 4
so. 0 251 4

Yet 0 251 5
another 0 251 5
Obama 0 251 5
dirty 1 251 5
deal 1 251 5
with 0 251 5
Iran 0 251 5
that 0 251 5
we're 0 251 5
just 0 251 5
learning 0 251 5
about 0 251 5
now. 0 251 5

The 0 251 6
question 0 251 6
is 0 251 6
how 1 251 6
many 1 251 6
more 1 251 6
are 1 251 6
there? 1 251 6

And 0 251 7
that's 0 251 7
part 0 251 7
of 0 251 7
why 0 251 7
Spygate 0 251 7
is 0 251 7
happening. 0 251 7

The 0 251 8
assault 0 251 8
is 0 251 8
also 0 251 8
a 0 251 8
cover-up. 0 251 8

The 0 251 9
report 0 251 9
by 0 251 9
the 0 251 9
Senate 0 251 9
Permanent 0 251 9
Subcommittee 0 251 9
on 0 251 9
Investigations 0 251 9
revealed 0 251 9
that 0 251 9
under 0 251 9
President 0 251 9
Barack 0 251 9
Obama, 0 251 9
the 0 251 9
Treasury 0 251 9
Department 0 251 9
issued 0 251 9
a 0 251 9
license 0 251 9
in 0 251 9
February 0 251 9
2016, 0 251 9
never 0 251 9
previously 0 251 9
disclosed, 0 251 9
that 0 251 9
would 0 251 9
have 0 251 9
allowed 0 251 9
Iran 0 251 9
to 0 251 9
convert 0 251 9
$5.7 0 251 9
billion 0 251 9
it 0 251 9
held 0 251 9
at 0 251 9
a 0 251 9
bank 0 251 9
in 0 251 9
Oman 0 251 9
from 0 251 9
Omani 0 251 9
rials 0 251 9
into 0 251 9
euros 0 251 9
by 0 251 9
exchanging 0 251 9
them 0 251 9
first 0 251 9
into 0 251 9
U.S. 0 251 9
dollars. 0 251 9

If 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
Omani 0 251 10
bank 0 251 10
had 0 251 10
allowed 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
exchange 0 251 10
without 0 251 10
such 0 251 10
a 0 251 10
license, 0 251 10
it 0 251 10
would 0 251 10
have 0 251 10
violated 0 251 10
sanctions 0 251 10
that 0 251 10
bar 0 251 10
Iran 0 251 10
from 0 251 10
transactions 0 251 10
that 0 251 10
touch 0 251 10
the 0 251 10
U.S. 0 251 10
financial 0 251 10
system. 0 251 10

The 0 251 11
effort 0 251 11
was 0 251 11
unsuccessful 0 251 11
because 0 251 11
American 0 251 11
banks 0 251 11
— 0 251 11
themselves 0 251 11
afraid 0 251 11
of 0 251 11
running 0 251 11
afoul 0 251 11
of 0 251 11
U.S. 0 251 11
sanctions 0 251 11
— 0 251 11
declined 0 251 11
to 0 251 11
participate. 0 251 11

The 0 251 12
Obama 0 251 12
administration 0 251 12
approached 0 251 12
two 0 251 12
U.S. 0 251 12
banks 0 251 12
to 0 251 12
facilitate 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
conversion, 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
report 0 251 12
said, 0 251 12
but 0 251 12
both 0 251 12
refused, 0 251 12
citing 0 251 12
the 0 251 12
reputational 0 251 12
risk 0 251 12
of 0 251 12
doing 0 251 12
business 0 251 12
with 0 251 12
or 0 251 12
for 0 251 12
Iran. 0 251 12

That's 0 251 13
how 0 251 13
bad 1 251 13
Obama 0 251 13
was 0 251 13
on 0 251 13
Iran. 0 251 13

The 0 251 14
banking 0 251 14
system 0 251 14
was 0 251 14
more 0 251 14
reluctant 0 251 14
to 0 251 14
help 0 251 14
Iran 0 251 14
launder 0 251 14
money 0 251 14
than 0 251 14
he 0 251 14
was. 0 251 14

Nor 0 251 15
was 0 251 15
Obama 0 251 15
worried 0 251 15
about 0 251 15
the 0 251 15
reputational 0 251 15
risk 0 251 15
of 0 251 15
loading 0 251 15
foreign 0 251 15
currency 0 251 15
on 0 251 15
unmarked 0 251 15
cargo 0 251 15
planes 0 251 15
and 0 251 15
flying 0 251 15
it 0 251 15
to 0 251 15
Iran. 0 251 15

Issuing 0 251 16
the 0 251 16
license 0 251 16
was 0 251 16
not 0 251 16
illegal. 0 251 16

Still, 0 251 17
it 0 251 17
went 0 251 17
above 0 251 17
and 0 251 17
beyond 0 251 17
what 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
Obama 0 251 17
administration 0 251 17
was 0 251 17
required 0 251 17
to 0 251 17
do 0 251 17
under 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
terms 0 251 17
of 0 251 17
the 0 251 17
nuclear 0 251 17
agreement. 0 251 17

Except 0 251 18
Obama 0 251 18
Inc. 0 251 18
weren't 0 251 18
trying 0 251 18
to 0 251 18
drive 0 251 18
a 0 251 18
hard 0 251 18
bargain. 0 251 18

So 0 251 19
they 0 251 19
didn't 0 251 19
stick 0 251 19
to 0 251 19
it. 0 251 19

They 0 251 20
were 0 251 20
trying 0 251 20
to 0 251 20
aid 0 251 20
Iran. 0 251 20

Shortly 0 251 21
after 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
nuclear 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
was 0 251 21
sealed 0 251 21
in 0 251 21
July 0 251 21
2015, 0 251 21
then-Treasury 0 251 21
Secretary 0 251 21
Jack 0 251 21
Lew 0 251 21
testified 0 251 21
that 0 251 21
even 0 251 21
with 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
sanctions 0 251 21
relief, 0 251 21
Iran 0 251 21
“will 0 251 21
continue 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
be 0 251 21
denied 0 251 21
access 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
largest 0 251 21
financial 0 251 21
and 0 251 21
commercial 0 251 21
market.” 0 251 21
A 0 251 21
month 0 251 21
later, 0 251 21
one 0 251 21
of 0 251 21
Lew’s 0 251 21
top 0 251 21
deputies, 0 251 21
Adam 0 251 21
Szubin, 0 251 21
testified 0 251 21
that 0 251 21
despite 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
nuclear 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
“Iran 0 251 21
will 0 251 21
be 0 251 21
denied 0 251 21
access 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
most 1 251 21
important 1 251 21
market 1 251 21
and 0 251 21
unable 0 251 21
to 0 251 21
deal 0 251 21
in 0 251 21
the 0 251 21
world’s 0 251 21
most 1 251 21
important 1 251 21
currency.” 1 251 21

This 0 251 22
was 0 251 22
typical 0 251 22
of 0 251 22
the 0 251 22
worthless 1 251 22
assurances 0 251 22
that 0 251 22
Obama 0 251 22
officials 0 251 22
made. 0 251 22

And 0 251 23
disgraced 1 251 23
themselves 0 251 23
by 0 251 23
doing 0 251 23
so. 0 251 23

Obama 0 251 24
administration 0 251 24
officials 0 251 24
at 0 251 24
the 0 251 24
time 0 251 24
assured 0 251 24
concerned 0 251 24
lawmakers 0 251 24
that 0 251 24
a 0 251 24
general 0 251 24
license 0 251 24
wouldn’t 0 251 24
be 0 251 24
coming. 0 251 24

But 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
report 0 251 25
from 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
Republican 0 251 25
members 0 251 25
of 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
Senate 0 251 25
panel 0 251 25
showed 0 251 25
that 0 251 25
a 0 251 25
draft 0 251 25
of 0 251 25
the 0 251 25
license 0 251 25
was 0 251 25
indeed 0 251 25
prepared, 0 251 25
though 0 251 25
it 0 251 25
was 0 251 25
never 0 251 25
published. 0 251 25

And 0 251 26
when 0 251 26
questioned 0 251 26
by 0 251 26
lawmakers 0 251 26
about 0 251 26
the 0 251 26

completed 0 304 35
his 0 304 35
task 0 304 35
of 0 304 35
modernizing 0 304 35
the 0 304 35
Roman 0 304 35
Catholic 0 304 35
Church 0 304 35
in 0 304 35

The 0 304 36

for 0 304 36
his 0 304 36
homosexual 0 304 36
modern 0 304 36

was 0 304 36
sounded 0 304 36

am 0 304 37
I 0 304 37
to 0 304 37

merciful 0 304 37
embrace 0 304 37
of 0 304 37

priests. 0 304 37

After 0 304 38
5 0 304 38
long 0 304 38
years, 0 304 38
his 0 304 38
unrelenting 0 304 38
mercy 0 304 38
mantra 0 304 38
seemingly 0 304 38
extends 0 304 38
only 0 304 38
to 0 304 38
homosexual 0 304 38
clerics, 0 304 38
not 0 304 38

by 0 304 38
prelates. 0 304 38

Francis’ 0 304 39
wink 0 304 39
and 0 304 39
nod 0 304 39
to 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
homosexual 0 304 39
lifestyle 0 304 39

him 0 304 39
on 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
cover 0 304 39
of 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
Advocate, 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
gay 0 304 39
magazine, 0 304 39
as 0 304 39
its 0 304 39
Man 0 304 39
of 0 304 39
the 0 304 39
Year. 0 304 39

He 0 304 40
lapped 0 304 40
up 0 304 40
the 0 304 40
accolades 0 304 40
from 0 304 40
the 0 304 40
secular 0 304 40
culture 0 304 40
and 0 304 40
main 0 304 40
stream 0 304 40
media. 0 304 40

Yet, 0 304 41
fame 0 304 41
is 0 304 41
and 0 304 41
predation 1 304 41
is 1 304 41
unrelenting, 1 304 41
even 0 304 41
for 0 304 41
Popes. 0 304 41

In 0 304 42
the 0 304 42
words 0 304 42
of 0 304 42
Queen 0 304 42
Elizabeth, 0 304 42
this 0 304 42
year 0 304 42
has 0 304 42
been 0 304 42
annus 0 304 42
horribilis 0 304 42
for 0 304 42
Francis. 0 304 42

Excuse 0 304 43
the 0 304 43
gay 0 304 43
slang 0 304 43
pun 0 304 43
but, 0 304 43
the 0 304 43
chickens 0 304 43
have 0 304 43
come 0 304 43
home 0 304 43
to 0 304 43
roost. 0 304 43

The 0 304 44
cascading 0 304 44
revelations 0 304 44
of 0 304 44
papal 0 304 44
sex 0 304 44
scandals 0 304 44
are 0 304 44
toppling 0 304 44
the 0 304 44
barque 0 304 44
of 0 304 44
Peter. 0 304 44

Will 0 304 45
Catholic 0 304 45
laity 0 304 45
pay 0 304 45
attention 0 304 45
and 0 304 45
take 0 304 45
action? 0 304 45

The 0 304 46
McCarrick 0 304 46
scandal 0 304 46
created 0 304 46
an 0 304 46
earthquake 1 304 46
in 0 304 46
the 0 304 46
Catholic 0 304 46
Church 0 304 46
with 0 304 46
aftershocks 0 304 46
that 0 304 46
will 0 304 46
last 0 304 46
for 0 304 46
years. 0 304 46

The 0 304 47
timing 0 304 47
is 0 304 47
eerily 1 304 47
propitious 0 304 47
and 0 304 47
providential 0 304 47
based 0 304 47
on 0 304 47
the 0 304 47
5 0 304 47
year 0 304 47
deadline. 0 304 47

Will 0 304 48
the 0 304 48
laity 0 304 48
step 0 304 48
up 0 304 48
and 0 304 48
reclaim 0 304 48
our 0 304 48
hijacked 1 304 48
Catholic 0 304 48
Church? 0 304 48

This 0 304 49
critical 0 304 49
time 0 304 49
in 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
history 0 304 49
of 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
Catholic 0 304 49
Church 0 304 49
demands 0 304 49
that 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
laity 0 304 49
step 0 304 49
forward 0 304 49
to 0 304 49
protect 0 304 49
the 0 304 49
Church, 0 304 49
its 0 304 49
children 0 304 49
and 0 304 49
seminarians 0 304 49
from 0 304 49
predators. 0 304 49

We 0 304 50
must 0 304 50
close 0 304 50
ranks 0 304 50
before 0 304 50
another 0 304 50
precious 0 304 50
child 0 304 50
is 0 304 50
exploited, 0 304 50
a 0 304 50
holy 0 304 50
seminarian 0 304 50
is 0 304 50
violated, 0 304 50
or 0 304 50
another 0 304 50
homosexual 0 304 50

is 0 304 50
covered 0 304 50
up 0 304 50
at 0 304 50
the 0 304 50
Vatican. 0 304 50

The 0 304 51
first 0 304 51

of 0 304 51

Discernment. 0 304 51

Remember 0 304 52
that 0 304 52
influential 1 304 52
Roman 0 304 52
gentleman 0 304 52
friend 0 304 52
of 0 304 52
McCarrick 0 304 52
who 0 304 52
said 0 304 52
that 0 304 52
Bergoglio 0 304 52
could 0 304 52
reform 0 304 52
the 0 304 52
Church 0 304 52
in 0 304 52
5 0 304 52
years? 0 304 52

Bergoglio’s 0 304 53
upcoming 0 304 53
Synod 0 304 53
on 0 304 53
Young 0 304 53
People 0 304 53
will 0 304 53
serve 0 304 53
as 0 304 53
the 0 304 53
culminating 0 304 53
vehicle 0 304 53
for 0 304 53
the 0 304 53
5 0 304 53
year 0 304 53
modernist 0 304 53
reform 0 304 53
of 0 304 53
the 0 304 53
St. 1 304 53
Gallen 1 304 53
Mafia. 1 304 53

This 0 304 54
Synod 0 304 54
is 0 304 54
designed 0 304 54
to 0 304 54
exploit 0 304 54
the 0 304 54
youth, 0 304 54
like 0 304 54
they’ve 0 304 54
been 0 304 54
doing 0 304 54
for 0 304 54
the 0 304 54
last 0 304 54
60 0 304 54
years. 0 304 54

If 0 304 55
it 0 304 55
weren’t 0 304 55
so 0 304 55
infuriating, 1 304 55
it 0 304 55
would 0 304 55
be 0 304 55
laughable 0 304 55
that 0 304 55
following 0 304 55
the 0 304 55
McCarrick 0 304 55
scandal 0 304 55
of 0 304 55
sexual 0 304 55
predation 0 304 55
of 0 304 55
young 0 304 55
males 0 304 55
and 0 304 55
seminarians, 0 304 55
by 0 304 55
a 0 304 55
Cardinal, 0 304 55
and 0 304 55
covered 0 304 55
up 0 304 55
by 0 304 55
Bishops, 0 304 55
the 0 304 55
Catholic 0 304 55
Church 0 304 55
would 0 304 55
host 0 304 55
a 0 304 55
Synod 0 304 55
of 0 304 55
Bishops 0 304 55
on 0 304 55
the 0 304 55
topic 0 304 55
of 0 304 55
young 0 304 55
people 0 304 55
and 0 304 55
vocations! 0 304 55

Furthermore, 0 304 56
this 0 304 56
nightmare 0 304 56
of 0 304 56
a 0 304 56
“sinod" 0 304 56
is 0 304 56
inviting 0 304 56
youth 0 304 56
from 0 304 56
ages 0 304 56
16-29 0 304 56
to 0 304 56
mingle 0 304 56
with 0 304 56
the 0 304 56
Bishops 0 304 56
to 0 304 56
discuss 0 304 56
the 0 304 56
Church, 0 304 56
faith 0 304 56
and 0 304 56
vocations. 0 304 56

Are 1 304 57
you 1 304 57
thoroughly 1 304 57
disgusted 1 304 57
by 1 304 57
this 1 304 57
farce? 1 304 57

The 0 304 58
Bishops 0 304 58
have 0 304 58
proven 0 304 58
that 0 304 58
they 0 304 58
cannot 0 304 58
be 0 304 58
trusted 0 304 58
to 0 304 58
protect 0 304 58
young 0 304 58
people 0 304 58
and 0 304 58
seminarians 0 304 58
from 0 304 58
predators. 0 304 58

The 0 304 59
ever 0 304 59
growing 0 304 59
global 0 304 59
list 0 304 59
of 0 304 59
Bishops 0 304 59
and 0 304 59
Cardinals 0 304 59
that 0 304 59
have 0 304 59
preyed 0 304 59
on 0 304 59
/and 0 304 59
or 0 304 59
covered 0 304 59
up 0 304 59
the 0 304 59
sexual 0 304 59
abuse 0 304 59
of 0 304 59
minors 0 304 59
and 0 304 59
seminarians 0 304 59
over 0 304 59
the 0 304 59
last 0 304 59
60 0 304 59
years 0 304 59
continues 0 304 59
to 0 304 59
enrage 0 304 59
the 0 304 59
laity. 0 304 59

We 0 304 60
are 0 304 60
no 0 304 60
longer 0 304 60
Shocked, 0 304 60
just 0 304 60
fed 0 304 60
up. 0 304 60

Let’s 0 304 61
start 0 304 61
with 0 304 61
the 0 304 61
Cardinal 0 304 61
who 0 304 61
will 0 304 61
lead 0 304 61
the 0 304 61
upcoming 0 304 61
Synod, 0 304 61
none 0 304 61
other 0 304 61
than 0 304 61
Cardinal 0 304 61
Kevin 0 304 61
Farrell, 0 304 61
Prefect 0 304 61
of 0 304 61
the 0 304 61
Dicastery 0 304 61
for 0 304 61
Laity, 0 304 61
Family 0 304 61
and 0 304 61
Life. 0 304 61

As 0 304 62
the 0 304 62
DC 0 304 62
roommate 0 304 62
and 0 304 62
protege 0 304 62
of 0 304 62
Ted 0 304 62
McCarrick, 0 304 62
Farrell 0 304 62
so 0 304 62
respected 0 304 62
McCarrick, 0 304 62
the 0 304 62
Molester, 1 304 62
that 0 304 62
he 0 304 62
fashioned 0 304 62
his 0 304 62
Coat 0 304 62
of 0 304 62
Arms 0 304 62
as 0 304 62
a 0 304 62
tribute 0 304 62
to 0 304 62
Uncle 0 304 62
Ted. 0 304 62

Farrell’s 0 304 63
pathetic 1 304 63
and 1 304 63
laughable 1 304 63
defense 0 304 63
“I 0 304 63
never 0 304 63
knew 0 304 63
anything 0 304 63
about 0 304 63
McCarrick” 0 304 63
video 0 304 63
highlights 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
continuing 0 304 63
conspiracy 0 304 63
of 0 304 63
denial 0 304 63
by 0 304 63
the 0 304 63
U.S. 0 304 63
Catholic 0 304 63
hierarchy. 0 304 63

Undoubtedly, 0 304 64
Farrell 0 304 64
as 0 304 64
the 0 304 64
head 0 304 64
of 0 304 64
this 0 304 64
Synod 0 304 64

Synod. 0 304 66

Farrell’s 0 304 67
graciously 0 304 67
offers 0 304 67
notorious 0 304 67

exposes 0 304 68
his 0 304 68
obvious 0 304 68
underlying 0 304 68
homosexual 0 304 68
agenda 0 304 68
and 0 304 68
aura 0 304 68
of 0 304 68
the 0 304 68
upcoming 0 304 68
Synod: 0 304 68

“A 0 304 69
welcome 0 304 69

in 0 305 2
the 0 305 2
matter 0 305 2

the 0 305 2

that 0 305 2

The 0 305 4
judge 0 305 4
should 0 305 4
understand 0 305 4
that 0 305 4

that 0 305 4
any 0 305 4

the 0 305 40

Washington 0 305 41
has 0 305 41
a 0 305 41
robust 0 305 41

That 0 305 42
system 0 305 42

by 0 305 42
the 0 305 42
Trump 0 305 42

Since 0 305 46

He 0 305 55
told 0 305 55
me 0 305 55
five 0 305 55
years 0 305 55
ago, 0 305 55
when 0 305 55
I 0 305 55
was 0 305 55
writing 0 305 55
a 0 305 55

over 0 305 55
gun-making 0 305 55

that 0 305 55
"This 0 305 55
has 0 305 55
been 0 305 55
a 0 305 55
continuous 0 305 55

of 0 305 55
different 0 305 55
levels 0 305 55
of 0 305 55

figures 0 305 55
trying 0 305 55

it 0 305 55
from 0 305 55
happening 0 305 55
and 0 305 55
thus 0 305 55
allowing 0 305 55
it 0 305 55
to 0 305 55
happen...Of 0 305 55
course 0 305 55
we 0 305 55
are 0 305 55
going 0 305 55
to 0 305 55
succeed—because 0 305 55
you 0 305 55
all 0 305 55
are 0 305 55
trying 0 305 55
to 0 305 55

That 0 305 56
seemed 0 305 56
natural 0 305 56

ended 0 305 56
up 0 305 56
being 0 305 56
true." 0 305 56

far, 0 305 57
that 0 305 57
has 0 305 57
continued 0 305 57

be 0 305 57
true. 0 305 57

This 1 305 58

know 1 305 58
what 1 305 58

brushing 0 308 14
off 0 308 14
suggestions 0 308 14
that 0 308 14
Trump’s 0 308 14

“The 0 308 15

Giuliani 0 308 15

in 0 308 15
an 0 308 15
interview. 0 308 15

“He 0 308 16
said 0 308 16

no 0 308 16

He 0 308 17
said 0 308 17
he 0 308 17
spoke 0 308 17
with 0 308 17
Trump 0 308 17
to 0 308 17
make 0 308 17
sure 0 308 17
that 0 308 17
the 0 308 17
president 0 308 17
wasn’t 0 308 17
actually 0 308 17
issuing 0 308 17
an 0 308 17
order. 0 308 17

“I 0 308 18

on 0 308 18
the 0 308 18
same 0 308 18
page 0 308 18
as 0 308 18
we 0 308 18
are,” 0 308 18
Giuliani 0 308 18
said, 0 308 18
and 0 308 18
the 0 308 18
president 0 308 18
indicated 0 308 18
he 0 308 18
was 0 308 18
not 0 308 18
ordering 0 308 18
Sessions 0 308 18
to 0 308 18
act. 0 308 18

On 0 308 19
Sunday, 0 308 19
Giuliani 0 308 19
told 0 308 19
CBS’ 0 308 19
“Face 0 308 19
the 0 308 19
Nation”: 0 308 19
“Obstruction 0 308 19
by 0 308 19
tweet 0 308 19
is 0 308 19
not 0 308 19
something 0 308 19
I 0 308 19
think 0 308 19
works 0 308 19
real 0 308 19
well. 0 308 19

Generally 0 308 20
obstruction 0 308 20
is 0 308 20
secret, 0 308 20
it’s 0 308 20
clandestine, 0 308 20
it’s 0 308 20
corrupt.” 0 308 20

Giuliani 0 308 21
added, 0 308 21
“I’ve 1 308 21
looked 1 308 21
at 1 308 21
all 1 308 21
those 1 308 21
tweets 1 308 21
and 1 308 21
they 1 308 21
don’t 1 308 21
amount 1 308 21
to 1 308 21
anything.” 1 308 21

For 0 308 22
months, 0 308 22
Trump’s 0 308 22
lawyers 0 308 22
also 0 308 22
have 0 308 22
argued 0 308 22
that 0 308 22
it’s 0 308 22
impossible 0 308 22
for 0 308 22
the 0 308 22
president 0 308 22
to 0 308 22
obstruct 0 308 22
justice 0 308 22
because 0 308 22
his 0 308 22
constitutional 0 308 22
authority 0 308 22
extends 0 308 22
over 0 308 22
the 0 308 22
Justice 0 308 22
Department. 0 308 22

That 0 308 23
power 0 308 23
allows 0 308 23
him 0 308 23
to 0 308 23
direct 0 308 23
officials 0 308 23
where 0 308 23
to 0 308 23
focus 0 308 23
their 0 308 23
resources 0 308 23
or 0 308 23
to 0 308 23
fire 0 308 23
them 0 308 23
when 0 308 23
he 0 308 23
chooses, 0 308 23
as 0 308 23
Trump 0 308 23
did 0 308 23
when 0 308 23
removing 0 308 23
James 0 308 23
B. 0 308 23
Comey 0 308 23
as 0 308 23
FBI 0 308 23
director 0 308 23
last 0 308 23
year. 0 308 23

That 0 308 24
firing, 0 308 24
however, 0 308 24
led 0 308 24
to 0 308 24
Mueller’s 0 308 24
appointment 0 308 24
as 0 308 24
special 0 308 24
counsel. 0 308 24

Wednesday’s 0 308 25
tweet 0 308 25
was 0 308 25
a 0 308 25
reminder 0 308 25
of 0 308 25
Trump’s 0 308 25
unabated 1 308 25
anger 1 308 25
at 0 308 25
Sessions, 0 308 25
who 0 308 25
recused 0 308 25
himself 0 308 25
from 0 308 25

contended 0 308 25
that 0 308 25

regulations 0 308 26
to 0 308 26

that, 0 308 26
as 0 308 26
one 1 308 26
of 1 308 26
Trump’s 1 308 26
earliest 1 308 26
and 1 308 26
most 1 308 26
active 1 308 26
supporters, 1 308 26
he 0 308 26
shouldn’t 0 308 26

in 0 308 26
the 0 308 26
investigation 0 308 26
of 0 308 26
the 0 308 26
Trump 0 308 26
campaign. 0 308 26

He 0 308 27
announced 0 308 27
the 0 308 27
decision 0 308 27
after 0 308 27
controversy 0 308 27
over 0 308 27
his 0 308 27
own 0 308 27
undisclosed 0 308 27

both 0 308 27
during 0 308 27

the 0 308 27

at 0 308 27
the 0 308 27

Two 1 308 28
months 1 308 28
ago, 1 308 28
Trump 1 308 28
tweeted 1 308 28
that 1 308 28
he 1 308 28
should 1 308 28
have 1 308 28
chosen 1 308 28
a 1 308 28
different 1 308 28
person 1 308 28
as 1 308 28
attorney 1 308 28
general 1 308 28
who 1 308 28
wouldn’t 1 308 28
have 1 308 28
needed 1 308 28
to 1 308 28
recuse 1 308 28
himself. 1 308 28

“I 1 308 29
wish 1 308 29
I 1 308 29
did!” 1 308 29
he 1 308 29
wrote. 1 308 29

In 1 308 30
his 1 308 30
tweets, 1 308 30
Trump 1 308 30
also 1 308 30
quoted 1 308 30
criticism 1 308 30
of 1 308 30
the 1 308 30
investigation 1 308 30
from 1 308 30
Alan 1 308 30

a 1 308 30
Harvard 1 308 30

School 1 308 30
professor 1 308 30
who 1 308 30
frequently 1 308 30
defends 1 308 30
Trump 1 308 30
on 1 308 30
television. 1 308 30

In 1 308 31
an 1 308 31
interview 1 308 31
with 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
Los 1 308 31
Angeles 1 308 31
Times, 1 308 31
Dershowitz 1 308 31
said 1 308 31
he 1 308 31
does 1 308 31
not 1 308 31
believe 1 308 31
Sessions 1 308 31
has 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
authority 1 308 31
to 1 308 31
end 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
probe. 1 308 31

“You 1 308 32
can’t 1 308 32
be 1 308 32
both 1 308 32
recused 1 308 32
and 1 308 32
making 1 308 32
decisions 1 308 32
about 1 308 32
the 1 308 32
investigation,” 1 308 32
he 1 308 32
said. 1 308 32

But 0 308 33
Dershowitz 0 308 33
also 0 308 33
cast 0 308 33
doubt 0 308 33
on 0 308 33
whether 0 308 33
Trump’s 0 308 33
tweets 0 308 33
can 0 308 33
be 0 308 33
seen 0 308 33
as 0 308 33
an 0 308 33
act 0 308 33
of 0 308 33
obstruction. 0 308 33

“You 0 308 34
cannot 0 308 34
obstruct 0 308 34
justice 0 308 34
by 0 308 34
openly 0 308 34
exercising 0 308 34
your 0 308 34
First 0 308 34
Amendment 0 308 34
rights 0 308 34
and 0 308 34
openly 0 308 34
criticizing 0 308 34
a 0 308 34
prosecution, 0 308 34
whether 0 308 34
you’re 0 308 34
right 0 308 34
or 0 308 34
wrong,” 0 308 34
he 0 308 34
said. 0 308 34

“Obstruction 0 308 35
of 0 308 35
justice 0 308 35
is 0 308 35
generally 0 308 35
committed 0 308 35
behind 0 308 35
the 0 308 35
scenes, 0 308 35
so 0 308 35
I 0 308 35
think 0 308 35
both 0 308 35
sides 0 308 35
are 0 308 35
a 0 308 35
little 0 308 35
overwrought 0 308 35
here.” 0 308 35

Stephen 0 308 36
Vladeck, 0 308 36
a 0 308 36
University 0 308 36
of 0 308 36
Texas 0 308 36
law 0 308 36
professor, 0 308 36
agreed 0 308 36
that 0 308 36
Sessions 0 308 36
cannot 0 308 36
stop 0 308 36
the 0 308 36
Russia 0 308 36
investigation 0 308 36
given 0 308 36
that 0 308 36
he 0 308 36
recused 0 308 36
himself. 0 308 36

“The 0 308 37
president, 0 308 37
intentionally 0 308 37
or 0 308 37
not, 0 308 37
is 0 308 37
misdirecting 1 308 37
his 1 308 37
ire,” 1 308 37
Vladeck 0 308 37
said. 0 308 37

If 0 308 38
Trump 0 308 38
wanted 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
use 0 308 38
his 0 308 38
power 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
end 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
probe, 0 308 38
he 0 308 38
would 0 308 38
have 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
give 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
order 0 308 38

according 0 308 38
to 0 308 38

and 0 311 2

shadow 1 311 3
without 1 311 3
hope 1 311 3
of 1 311 3
reprieve. 1 311 3

God 0 311 4
made 0 311 4
that 0 311 4
clear 0 311 4
when 0 311 4
He 0 311 4
told 0 311 4
Adam 0 311 4
that 0 311 4
“in 0 311 4
what 0 311 4
day 0 311 4
soever” 0 311 4
he 0 311 4
preferred 0 311 4
his 0 311 4
own 0 311 4
will 0 311 4
above 0 311 4
his 0 311 4
Creator’s, 0 311 4
“thou 1 311 4
shalt 1 311 4
die 1 311 4
the 1 311 4
death,” 1 311 4
condemning 0 311 4
him 0 311 4
sooner 0 311 4
or 0 311 4
later 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
“return 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
the 0 311 4
earth 0 311 4
out 0 311 4
of 0 311 4
which 0 311 4
thou 0 311 4
wast 0 311 4
taken: 0 311 4
for 0 311 4
dust 0 311 4
thou 0 311 4
art, 0 311 4
and 0 311 4
to 0 311 4
dust 0 311 4
thou 0 311 4
shalt 0 311 4
return” 0 311 4
(Gen. 0 311 4
3:19). 0 311 4

In 0 311 5
other 0 311 5
words, 0 311 5
there 1 311 5
has 1 311 5
always 1 311 5
been 1 311 5
a 1 311 5
death 1 311 5
penalty. 1 311 5

God 1 311 6
instituted 1 311 6
it, 1 311 6
and 1 311 6
He 1 311 6
was 1 311 6
the 1 311 6
first 1 311 6
to 1 311 6
impose 1 311 6
it, 1 311 6
embedding 1 311 6
it 1 311 6
in 1 311 6
the 1 311 6
very 1 311 6
fabric 1 311 6
of 1 311 6
natural 1 311 6
law. 1 311 6

When 0 311 7
Cain 0 311 7
took 0 311 7
it 0 311 7
upon 0 311 7
himself 0 311 7
to 0 311 7
inflict 0 311 7
death 0 311 7
on 0 311 7
his 0 311 7
brother 0 311 7
Abel 0 311 7
“in 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
field,” 0 311 7
he 0 311 7
soon 0 311 7
learned 0 311 7
that 0 311 7
God 0 311 7
furthermore 0 311 7
reserved 0 311 7
the 0 311 7
exercise 0 311 7
of 0 311 7
this 0 311 7
right 0 311 7
to 0 311 7
himself 0 311 7
alone. 0 311 7

Cain 0 311 8
is 0 311 8
told, 0 311 8
“What 0 311 8
hast 0 311 8
thou 0 311 8
done? 0 311 8

The 0 311 9
voice 0 311 9
of 0 311 9
thy 0 311 9
brother’s 0 311 9
blood 0 311 9
crieth 0 311 9
to 0 311 9
me 0 311 9
from 0 311 9
the 0 311 9
earth,” 0 311 9
and 0 311 9
God 1 311 9
curses 1 311 9
him 1 311 9
for 0 311 9
his 0 311 9
presumption 0 311 9
by 0 311 9
dooming 1 311 9
him 1 311 9
to 0 311 9
homelessness 0 311 9
and 0 311 9
unproductive 0 311 9
labor. 0 311 9

When 0 311 10
Cain 0 311 10
complains 0 311 10
that 0 311 10
being 0 311 10
a 1 311 10
“vagabond 1 311 10
. 0 311 10

. 0 311 11

. 0 311 12

on 0 311 13
the 0 311 13
earth, 0 311 13
every 0 311 13
one 0 311 13
therefore 0 311 13
that 0 311 13
findeth 0 311 13
me, 0 311 13
shall 0 311 13
kill 0 311 13
me,” 0 311 13
God 0 311 13
laid 0 311 13
down 0 311 13
that 0 311 13
“whoever 0 311 13
shall 0 311 13
kill 0 311 13
Cain 0 311 13
shall 0 311 13
be 0 311 13
punished 1 311 13
sevenfold,” 1 311 13
setting 0 311 13
a 0 311 13
mysterious 0 311 13
identifying 0 311 13
mark 0 311 13
on 0 311 13
him 0 311 13
to 0 311 13
protect 0 311 13
him 0 311 13
from 0 311 13
the 0 311 13
vengeance 0 311 13
of 0 311 13
others. 0 311 13

The 0 311 14
Fifth 0 311 14
Commandment 0 311 14
later 0 311 14
delivered 0 311 14
to 0 311 14
Moses, 0 311 14
“Thou 0 311 14
shalt 0 311 14
not 0 311 14
kill,” 0 311 14
therefore 0 311 14
dates 0 311 14
from 0 311 14
adamic 0 311 14
times, 0 311 14
when 0 311 14
it 0 311 14
operated 0 311 14
as 0 311 14
God’s 0 311 14
exclusive 0 311 14
prerogative, 0 311 14
allowing 0 311 14
no 0 311 14
exceptions. 0 311 14

Although 0 311 15
men 0 311 15
certainly 0 311 15
continued 0 311 15
to 0 311 15
kill 0 311 15
one 0 311 15
another 0 311 15
in 0 311 15
a 0 311 15
society 0 311 15
which 0 311 15
in 0 311 15
fact 0 311 15
became 0 311 15
so 1 311 15
wicked 1 311 15
"that 0 311 15
all 0 311 15
the 0 311 15
thought 0 311 15
of 0 311 15
their 0 311 15
heart 0 311 15
was 0 311 15
bent 0 311 15
upon 0 311 15
evil 0 311 15
at 0 311 15
all 0 311 15
times," 0 311 15
they 0 311 15
did 0 311 15
so 0 311 15
as 0 311 15
murderers, 0 311 15
outside 0 311 15
God's 0 311 15
law 0 311 15
without 0 311 15
legal 0 311 15
right. 0 311 15

Only 0 311 16
after 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
Flood, 0 311 16
when 0 311 16
Noah 0 311 16
and 0 311 16
his 0 311 16
sons 0 311 16
set 0 311 16
about 0 311 16
repopulating 0 311 16
the 0 311 16
earth, 0 311 16
did 0 311 16
God 0 311 16
delegate 0 311 16
to 0 311 16
human 0 311 16
society 0 311 16
His 0 311 16
exclusive 0 311 16
authority 0 311 16

the 0 311 16
death 0 311 16
penalty 0 311 16
for 0 311 16
just 0 311 16

He 0 311 17
told 0 311 17
Noah, 0 311 17
“For 0 311 17

In 0 311 47
the 0 311 47
metaphysical 0 311 47
order, 0 311 47
penalty 0 311 47
is 0 311 47

of 0 311 47

If 0 311 48
it 0 311 48

Today 0 311 49
the 0 311 49
death 0 311 49

is 0 311 49
imposed 0 311 49

The 0 311 55
circumstances 0 311 55
pertaining 0 311 55
to 0 311 55
our 0 311 55
day 0 311 55
would 0 311 55
therefore 0 311 55
dictate 0 311 55
a 0 311 55
reassessment 0 311 55
of 0 311 55
the 0 311 55
death 0 311 55
penalty, 0 311 55
which 0 311 55
the 1 311 55
new 1 311 55
man-centered 1 311 55
theology 1 311 55

on 0 311 55

the 0 311 55
criminal 0 311 55
and 0 311 55
human 0 311 55
society 0 311 55
rather 0 311 55
than 0 311 55
from 0 311 55
God’s. 0 311 55

At 0 311 56
the 0 311 56
same 0 311 56
time, 0 311 56
there 0 311 56
is 0 311 56
more 0 311 56
and 0 311 56
more 0 311 56
discussion 0 311 56
about 0 311 56
society’s 0 311 56
responsibility 0 311 56
for 0 311 56
having 0 311 56
produced 0 311 56
criminals 0 311 56
in 0 311 56
the 0 311 56
first 0 311 56
place, 0 311 56
together 0 311 56
with 0 311 56
our 0 311 56
moral 0 311 56
obligation 0 311 56
to 0 311 56
rehabilitate 0 311 56
them 0 311 56
rather 0 311 56
than 0 311 56
to 0 311 56
wreak 0 311 56
what 0 311 56
is 0 311 56
now 0 311 56
considered 0 311 56
a 0 311 56

guilty 1 311 56
“vengeance” 1 311 56
on 0 311 56

them. 0 311 57
The 0 311 57
idea 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
man 0 311 57
is 0 311 57
by 0 311 57
nature 0 311 57
good 0 311 57
and 0 311 57
perfectible 0 311 57
is 0 311 57
allowed 0 311 57
to 0 311 57
override 0 311 57
all 0 311 57
documented 0 311 57
evidence 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
hardened 0 311 57
criminals 0 311 57
are 0 311 57
in 0 311 57
fact 0 311 57
almost 0 311 57
impossible 0 311 57
to 0 311 57
rehabilitate 0 311 57
and 0 311 57
that 0 311 57
those 0 311 57
handed 0 311 57
life 0 311 57
sentences 0 311 57
rarely 0 311 57
repent 0 311 57
of 0 311 57
their 0 311 57
wrongdoing. 0 311 57

According 0 311 58
to 0 311 58
one 0 311 58
widely 0 311 58
held 0 311 58
opinion, 0 311 58
the 0 311 58
death 0 311 58
penalty 0 311 58
has 0 311 58
proved 0 311 58
to 0 311 58
be 0 311 58
no 0 311 58
effective 0 311 58
deterrent 0 311 58
to 0 311 58
crime 0 311 58
in 0 311 58
any 0 311 58
case, 0 311 58
and 0 311 58
should 0 311 58
be 0 311 58
discarded 0 311 58
as 0 311 58
impractical. 0 311 58

What 1 311 59
proof 1 311 59
of 1 311 59
this 1 311 59
can 1 311 59
possibly 1 311 59
be 1 311 59
offered? 1 311 59

How 1 311 60
can 1 311 60
we 1 311 60

know? 1 311 61
Deterrence 0 311 61
from 0 311 61
evil 0 311 61
is 0 311 61
not 0 311 61
the 0 311 61
primary 0 311 61
purpose 0 311 61
of 0 311 61
meting 0 311 61
out 0 311 61
punishment 0 311 61
in 0 311 61
any 0 311 61
case, 0 311 61
yet 0 311 61
Scripture 0 311 61
attests 0 311 61
to 0 311 61
deterrence 0 311 61
as 0 311 61
an 0 311 61
important 0 311 61
side 0 311 61

of 0 311 61

do 0 311 65
such 0 311 65
things. 0 311 65

Thou 0 311 66
shalt 0 311 66
not 0 311 66

(Deut. 0 311 67
19:19-21). 0 311 67

And 0 311 68
the 0 311 68
Preacher 0 311 68
notes 0 311 68
that 0 311 68
when 1 311 68
“sentence 1 311 68

the 1 311 68
evil, 1 311 68

children 1 311 68

To 0 311 70
illustrate 0 311 70
how 1 311 70
shallow 1 311 70
Catholic 1 311 70
thinking 1 311 70
on 1 311 70
the 1 311 70
death 1 311 70
penalty 1 311 70
has 1 311 70
become 1 311 70
and 1 311 70
how 1 311 70
far 1 311 70
it 1 311 70
has 1 311 70
deviated 1 311 70
from 1 311 70
the 1 311 70
age-old 1 311 70
doctrine 1 311 70
of 1 311 70
the 1 311 70
Church, 1 311 70
a 0 311 70
priest 0 311 70
of 0 311 70
a 0 311 70
presumably 0 311 70
traditional 0 311 70
Catholic 0 311 70
Fraternity 0 311 70
writes 0 311 70
in 0 311 70

to 0 311 70
a 0 311 70
query 0 311 70
addressed 0 311 70
to 0 311 70
him 0 311 70
on 0 311 70
the 0 311 70
subject 0 311 70
by 0 311 70

saying: 0 311 71
The 0 311 71
death 0 311 71
penalty 0 311 71
is 0 311 71
based 0 311 71
on 0 311 71
the 0 311 71
common 0 311 71
teachings 0 311 71
of 0 311 71
theologians, 0 311 71
but 0 311 71
is 0 311 71
not 0 311 71
itself 0 311 71
a 0 311 71
declared 0 311 71

dogma. 0 311 72
Therefore 0 311 72
it 0 311 72
is 0 311 72
not 0 311 72
permissible 0 311 72
to 0 311 72
call 0 311 72
those 0 311 72
who 0 311 72
hold 0 311 72
it 0 311 72
is, 0 311 72
immoral 1 311 72
heretics. 1 311 72

To 0 311 73
approach 0 311 73
this 0 311 73
as 0 311 73
a 0 311 73
dogmatic 0 311 73
teaching 0 311 73
is 0 311 73
imprudent. 1 311 73

Those 0 311 74
who 0 311 74
argue 0 311 74
for 0 311 74
its 0 311 74
abolition 0 311 74
do 0 311 74
not 0 311 74
necessarily 0 311 74
put 0 311 74
society 0 311 74
in 0 311 74
danger 0 311 74
considering 0 311 74
possibilities 0 311 74
of 0 311 74
penal 0 311 74
systems. 0 311 74

Those, 0 311 75
however, 0 311 75

it 0 311 75

as 0 311 75
a 1 311 75
tool 1 311 75
for 1 311 75

Please 0 311 76
consider 0 311 76
that 0 311 76
in 0 311 76
anger 0 311 76
and 0 311 76
tragedy, 0 311 76
the 0 311 76
desire 0 311 76
for 0 311 76
revenge 0 311 76
usually 0 311 76
overrides 0 311 76
reason 0 311 76
and 0 311 76
an 0 311 76
honest 0 311 76
answering 0 311 76
of 0 311 76
the 0 311 76
question 0 311 76
“must 0 311 76
this 0 311 76
person’s 0 311 76
life 0 311 76
be 0 311 76
taken 0 311 76
to 0 311 76
preserve 0 311 76
society?” 0 311 76
The 1 311 76
desire 1 311 76
for 1 311 76
swift 1 311 76
and 1 311 76
firm 1 311 76
convictions 1 311 76
has 1 311 76
sent 1 311 76
many 1 311 76
to 1 311 76
death 1 311 76
who 1 311 76
never 1 311 76
deserved 1 311 76
such 1 311 76
a 1 311 76
punishment, 1 311 76
nor 1 311 76
was 1 311 76
such 1 311 76
a 1 311 76
punishment 1 311 76
truly 1 311 76
necessary 1 311 76
for 1 311 76
the 1 311 76
safety 1 311 76
of 1 311 76
society. 1 311 76

I 0 311 77
do 0 311 77
not 0 311 77
believe 0 311 77
the 0 311 77
death 0 311 77
penalty 0 311 77
is 0 311 77
necessary 0 311 77
in 0 311 77
90 0 311 77
percent 0 311 77
of 0 311 77
the 0 311 77
cases 0 311 77
where 0 311 77
it 0 311 77
is 0 311 77
applied. 0 311 77

Thus 0 311 78
to 0 311 78
call 0 311 78
for 0 311 78
a 0 311 78
moratorium 0 311 78

. 0 311 79

. 0 311 80

. 0 311 81
is 0 311 81
not 0 311 81
unjust 0 311 81
or 0 311 81
incorrect. 0 311 81

That 0 311 82
the 0 311 82
death 0 311 82
penalty 0 311 82
can 0 311 82
become 0 311 82
an 0 311 82
instrument 0 311 82
of 0 311 82
revenge, 0 311 82
and 0 311 82
that 0 311 82
unjust 0 311 82
sentences 0 311 82
are 0 311 82
sometimes 0 311 82
handed 0 311 82
down 0 311 82
can 0 311 82
be 0 311 82
dismissed 0 311 82
as 0 311 82
irrelevant 0 311 82
to 0 311 82
the 0 311 82
argument. 0 311 82

Given 0 311 83
the 1 311 83
fallen 1 311 83
human 1 311 83
condition, 1 311 83
such 1 311 83
injustices 1 311 83
are 1 311 83
bound 1 311 83
to 1 311 83
occur 1 311 83
in 1 311 83
any 1 311 83
judicial 1 311 83
system, 1 311 83
and 0 311 83
everyone 0 311 83
agrees 0 311 83
that 0 311 83
they 0 311 83
should 0 311 83
be 0 311 83
ruthlessly 1 311 83
remedied. 1 311 83

What 0 311 84
is 0 311 84
not 0 311 84
irrelevant 0 311 84
is 0 311 84
that 0 311 84
the 1 311 84
author 1 311 84
of 1 311 84
the 1 311 84
letter 1 311 84
falls 1 311 84
headlong 1 311 84
into 1 311 84
the 1 311 84
very 1 311 84
error 1 311 84

he 0 311 85
feels 0 311 85
the 0 311 85

can 0 311 85
now 0 311 85

That 0 311 86
the 0 311 86

It 0 311 123

still 0 311 123
“appointed 0 311 123

even 0 311 128
from 0 311 128
the 0 311 128

who 1 311 129
is 1 311 129
Christ 1 311 129
the 1 311 129
King, 1 311 129

Father 0 311 130
(Matt. 0 311 130

From 1 311 131
that 1 311 131

it 1 311 131

Christ 1 311 131

both 1 311 131
Scripture 1 311 131
and 1 311 131
tradition 1 311 131
testify 1 311 131
that 1 311 131
it 1 311 131

lawfully 1 311 131
wielded 1 311 131
by 1 311 131
those 1 311 131
to 1 311 131
whom 1 311 131
He 1 311 131

His 1 311 132

As 0 311 132
He 0 311 132
told 0 311 132
Pontius 0 311 132
Pilate 0 311 132
at 0 311 132
the 0 311 132
time 0 311 132
of 0 311 132
His 0 311 132
trial, 0 311 132
“Thou 0 311 132

Pope 0 311 133
Leo 0 311 133

Sapientiae 0 311 133
Christianae 0 311 133
in 0 311 133
1890, 0 311 133
when 0 311 133
he 0 311 133
declared 0 311 133
that 0 311 133
“true 0 311 133

The 0 311 134

Even 0 311 134
though 0 311 134
they 0 311 134
may 0 311 134
be 0 311 134
unaware 0 311 134
of 0 311 134

source 0 311 134
of 0 311 134
their 0 311 134
power, 0 311 134
it 0 311 134

death 0 311 134

if 0 311 135
appropriate. 0 311 135
As 0 311 135

St. 0 311 136
Paul 0 311 136
said: 0 311 136
Therefore 0 311 136

damnation. 0 311 137
For 0 311 137
rulers 0 311 137

not 0 311 137
a 0 311 137
terror 0 311 137

the 0 311 144
penalty 0 311 144

of 0 311 145
death. 0 311 145
It 0 311 145

(Rom 0 311 145

A 0 311 146

making 0 311 146
restitution 0 311 146

accorded 0 311 146
to 0 311 146
all 0 311 146
of 0 311 146
us, 0 311 146

although 0 311 146
our 0 311 146
Lord’s 0 311 146
ignominious 0 311 146
death 0 311 146
removed 0 311 146
from 0 311 146
us 0 311 146
the 0 311 146
guilt 0 311 146
of 0 311 146
the 0 311 146
original 0 311 146
transgression 0 311 146
through 0 311 146
Baptism, 0 311 146
it 0 311 146

not 0 311 146
remove 0 311 146

its 0 311 147
effects. 0 311 147
These 0 311 147
were 0 311 147
allowed 0 311 147
to 0 311 147

incalculably 1 311 147
more 1 311 147
grievous 1 311 147
sins 1 311 147
than 1 311 147

heretofore. 1 311 148
As 0 311 148
for 0 311 148
the 0 311 148
death 0 311 148
penalty, 0 311 148
it 0 311 148
remains 0 311 148
the 1 311 148
inescapable 1 311 148
consequence 1 311 148
of 1 311 148
our 1 311 148
fallen 1 311 148
nature 1 311 148
and 0 311 148
is 0 311 148
of 0 311 148
the 0 311 148
highest 0 311 148
utility 0 311 148
in 0 311 148
deterring 0 311 148

our 1 311 148
hereditary 1 311 148

to 1 311 149
evil. 1 311 149
What 0 311 149
Christ 0 311 149
did 0 311 149
was 0 311 149
to 0 311 149
sanctify 0 311 149
the 0 311 149
death 0 311 149
penalty, 0 311 149
transforming 0 311 149
it 0 311 149
into 0 311 149
a 0 311 149
sacrament 0 311 149
of 0 311 149

for 0 311 149
those 0 311 149

believe. 0 311 150
As 0 311 150
St. 0 311 150
Paul 0 311 150
declared, 0 311 150
“Death 0 311 150

up 0 311 151
in 0 311 151

O 0 311 151
death, 0 311 151

“That 0 313 7
all 0 313 7
changed 0 313 7
for 0 313 7
me 0 313 7
when 0 313 7

Georgia 0 313 7
Detective 0 313 7
that 0 313 7
we 0 313 7
reasonably 0 313 7
believed 0 313 7

from 0 313 7
someone 0 313 7
at 0 313 7
the 0 313 7
compound 0 313 7
– 0 313 7
the 0 313 7
message 0 313 7
sent 0 313 7
to 0 313 7
a 0 313 7
third 0 313 7
party 0 313 7
simply 0 313 7
said 0 313 7
in 0 313 7
part 0 313 7
“we 0 313 7
are 0 313 7

I 0 313 8
absolutely 0 313 8

I 0 313 8
got 0 313 8
that 0 313 8
intercepted 0 313 8

approach 0 313 8
for 0 313 8
our 0 313 8
own 0 313 8

because 0 313 8
we 0 313 8
had 0 313 8
learned 0 313 8
the 0 313 8

were 0 313 8
most 0 313 8
likely 0 313 8
heavily 0 313 8
armed 0 313 8

We 0 313 9
also 0 313 9
knew 0 313 9

the 0 313 9
layout 0 313 9
of 0 313 9
the 0 313 9

would 0 313 9
have 0 313 9

"My 0 314 46

That 0 314 47

When 0 314 48
I 0 314 48
would 0 314 48
ask 0 314 48
him 0 314 48
where 0 314 48
he 0 314 48

I 0 314 49

with 0 322 6
prosecutors 0 322 6

many 0 322 6

The 0 322 7
report 0 322 7
has 0 322 7
helped 0 322 7
renew 0 322 7
a 0 322 7
crisis 0 322 7
many 0 322 7
in 0 322 7
the 0 322 7
church 0 322 7
thought 0 322 7
and 0 322 7
hoped 0 322 7
had 0 322 7
ended 0 322 7
nearly 0 322 7
20 0 322 7
years 0 322 7

after 1 322 7
the 1 322 7
scandal 1 322 7
erupted 1 322 7
in 0 322 7
Boston. 0 322 7

But 1 322 8
recent 1 322 8
abuse-related 1 322 8
scandals, 1 322 8
from 1 322 8
Chile 1 322 8
to 1 322 8
Australia, 1 322 8
have 1 322 8
reopened 1 322 8
wounding 1 322 8
questions 1 322 8
about 1 322 8
accountability 1 322 8
and 1 322 8
whether 1 322 8
church 1 322 8
officials 1 322 8
are 1 322 8
still 1 322 8
covering 1 322 8
up 1 322 8
crimes 1 322 8
at 1 322 8
the 1 322 8
highest 1 322 8
levels. 1 322 8

The 1 322 9
new 1 322 9
wave 1 322 9
of 1 322 9
allegations 1 322 9
has 1 322 9
called 1 322 9
Pope 1 322 9
Francis’s 1 322 9
handling 1 322 9
of 1 322 9
abuse 1 322 9
into 1 322 9
question 1 322 9
as 1 322 9
many 1 322 9
Catholics 1 322 9
look 1 322 9
to 1 322 9
him 1 322 9
to 1 322 9
help 1 322 9
the 1 322 9
church 1 322 9
regain 1 322 9
its 1 322 9
credibility. 1 322 9

The 1 322 10
pope’s 1 322 10
track 1 322 10
record 1 322 10
has 1 322 10
been 1 322 10
mixed, 1 322 10
something 1 322 10
some 1 322 10
outsiders 1 322 10
attribute 1 322 10
to 1 322 10
his 1 322 10
learning 1 322 10
curve 1 322 10
or 1 322 10
shortcomings 1 322 10
and 0 322 10
others 0 322 10
chalk 0 322 10
up 0 322 10
to 0 322 10
resistance 0 322 10
from 0 322 10
a 1 322 10
notoriously 1 322 10
change-averse 1 322 10
institution. 1 322 10

The 0 322 11
Pennsylvania 0 322 11
grand 0 322 11
jury 0 322 11
report 0 322 11
follows 0 322 11
the 0 322 11
resignation 0 322 11
last 0 322 11
month 0 322 11
of 0 322 11
Cardinal 0 322 11
Theodore 0 322 11
McCarrick, 0 322 11
a 1 322 11
towering 1 322 11
figure 1 322 11
in 1 322 11
the 1 322 11
U.S. 1 322 11
church 1 322 11
and 0 322 11
former 0 322 11
D.C. 0 322 11
archbishop 0 322 11
who 0 322 11
was 0 322 11
accused 0 322 11
of 0 322 11
sexually 0 322 11
abusing 0 322 11
minors 0 322 11
and 0 322 11
adults 0 322 11
for 0 322 11
decades. 0 322 11

Both 0 322 12
have 0 322 12
further 0 322 12
polarized 0 322 12
the 0 322 12
church 0 322 12
on 0 322 12
homosexuality, 0 322 12
celibacy 0 322 12
and 0 322 12
whether 0 322 12
laypeople 0 322 12
should 0 322 12
have 0 322 12
more 0 322 12

power. 0 322 13
It 0 322 13
has 0 322 13
also 0 322 13
triggered 0 322 13
debate 0 322 13
about 0 322 13
whether 0 322 13
statutes 0 322 13
of 0 322 13
limitations 0 322 13
should 0 322 13
be 0 322 13
expanded. 0 322 13

“We’re 0 322 14
dealing 0 322 14
with 0 322 14
a 0 322 14
long-term 0 322 14
struggle 0 322 14
not 0 322 14
only 0 322 14
about 0 322 14
the 0 322 14
meaning 0 322 14
of 0 322 14
justice, 0 322 14
but 0 322 14
about 0 322 14
the 0 322 14
meaning 0 322 14
of 0 322 14
memory,” 0 322 14
said 0 322 14
Jason 0 322 14
Berry, 0 322 14
a 0 322 14
reporter 0 322 14
and 0 322 14
author 0 322 14
who 0 322 14
has 0 322 14
covered 0 322 14
the 0 322 14
sexual 0 322 14
abuse 0 322 14
crisis 0 322 14
for 0 322 14
decades. 0 322 14

“And 1 322 15
how 1 322 15
honest 1 322 15
the 1 322 15
church 1 322 15
has 1 322 15
been 1 322 15
about 1 322 15
this 1 322 15

crisis. 1 322 16
Most 1 322 16
bishops, 1 322 16
besides 1 322 16
apologies, 1 322 16
have 1 322 16
not 1 322 16
been 1 322 16
on 1 322 16
the 1 322 16
cutting 1 322 16
edge 1 322 16
of 1 322 16
change.” 1 322 16

Church 0 322 17
officials 0 322 17
began 0 322 17
bracing 0 322 17
for 0 322 17
the 0 322 17
aftermath 0 322 17
of 0 322 17
the 0 322 17

is 0 324 22
now 0 324 22
emerging. 0 324 22

Many 0 324 23

were 0 324 23
active 0 324 23

Many 0 324 25

than 1 79 10
‘we’re 1 79 10

he 0 79 10

In 0 79 11
his 0 79 11

a 0 79 11
famous 0 79 11
2005 0 79 11
quote 0 79 11
by 0 79 11
his 0 79 11

Benedict 0 79 11
XVI, 0 79 11
who, 0 79 11
a 0 79 11
month 0 79 11
before 0 79 11
being 0 79 11
elected 0 79 11
pope, 0 79 11
lamented 0 79 11
“how 1 79 11
much 1 79 11
filth” 1 79 11
there 0 79 11
was 0 79 11
in 0 79 11
the 0 79 11
Catholic 0 79 11
Church. 0 79 11

“With 1 79 12
shame 1 79 12
and 1 79 12
repentance, 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
acknowledge 1 79 12
as 1 79 12
an 1 79 12
ecclesial 1 79 12
community 1 79 12
that 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
were 1 79 12
not 1 79 12
where 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
should 1 79 12
have 1 79 12
been, 1 79 12
that 1 79 12
we 1 79 12
did 1 79 12
not 1 79 12
act 1 79 12
in 1 79 12
a 1 79 12
timely 1 79 12
manner, 1 79 12
realizing 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
magnitude 1 79 12
and 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
gravity 1 79 12
of 1 79 12
the 1 79 12
damage 1 79 12
done 1 79 12
to 1 79 12
so 1 79 12
many 1 79 12
lives. 1 79 12

We 1 79 13
showed 1 79 13
no 1 79 13
care 1 79 13
for 1 79 13
the 1 79 13
little 1 79 13
ones; 1 79 13
we 1 79 13
abandoned 1 79 13
them,” 1 79 13
Francis 0 79 13
said. 0 79 13

“Looking 0 79 14
back 0 79 14
to 0 79 14
the 0 79 14
past, 0 79 14
no 1 79 14
effort 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
beg 1 79 14
pardon 1 79 14
and 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
seek 1 79 14
to 1 79 14
repair 1 79 14
the 1 79 14
harm 1 79 14
done 1 79 14
will 1 79 14
ever 1 79 14
be 1 79 14
sufficient. 1 79 14

Looking 0 79 15
ahead 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
the 0 79 15
future, 0 79 15
no 0 79 15
effort 0 79 15
must 0 79 15
be 0 79 15
spared 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
create 0 79 15
a 0 79 15
culture 0 79 15
able 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
prevent 0 79 15
such 0 79 15
situations 0 79 15
from 0 79 15
happening, 0 79 15
but 0 79 15
also 0 79 15
to 0 79 15
prevent 0 79 15
the 0 79 15
possibility 0 79 15
of 0 79 15
their 0 79 15
being 0 79 15
covered 0 79 15
up 0 79 15
and 0 79 15
perpetuated,” 0 79 15
he 0 79 15
added. 0 79 15

Colm 0 79 16
O’Gorman, 0 79 16
an 0 79 16
Irish 0 79 16
abuse 0 79 16
survivor 0 79 16
who 0 79 16
founded 0 79 16
One 0 79 16
in 0 79 16
Four, 0 79 16
the 0 79 16
main 0 79 16
survivors’ 0 79 16
group 0 79 16
in 0 79 16
Ireland, 0 79 16
commented 0 79 16
on 0 79 16
Twitter 0 79 16
that 0 79 16
the 0 79 16
pope 0 79 16
offered 0 79 16
“Much 0 79 16
stronger 0 79 16
language 0 79 16
than 0 79 16
ever 0 79 16
used 0 79 16
before.” 0 79 16

But 0 79 17
O’Gorman 0 79 17
added: 0 79 17
“(The 1 79 17
pope) 1 79 17
begs 1 79 17
for 1 79 17
forgiveness, 1 79 17
but 1 79 17
still 1 79 17
does 1 79 17
not 1 79 17
admit 1 79 17
or 1 79 17
own 1 79 17
the 1 79 17
deliberate 1 79 17
policy 1 79 17
of 1 79 17
cover 1 79 17
up 1 79 17
designed 1 79 17
& 1 79 17
implemented 1 79 17
by 1 79 17
the 1 79 17
#Vatican.” 1 79 17

Like 1 79 18
his 1 79 18
predecessor, 1 79 18
Francis 1 79 18
has 1 79 18
promised 1 79 18
“zero 1 79 18
tolerance” 1 79 18
on 1 79 18
child 1 79 18
abuse, 1 79 18
but 1 79 18
scandals 1 79 18
have 1 79 18
kept 1 79 18
recurring 1 79 18
in 1 79 18
several 1 79 18
parts 1 79 18
of 1 79 18
the 1 79 18
world 1 79 18
— 1 79 18
including 1 79 18
in 1 79 18
Australia 1 79 18
recently. 1 79 18

In 0 79 19
January, 0 79 19
the 0 79 19
pope 0 79 19
was 0 79 19
accused 0 79 19
of 0 79 19
insensitivity 0 79 19
and 0 79 19
tone-deafness 0 79 19
after 0 79 19
insisting, 0 79 19
during 0 79 19
a 0 79 19
visit 0 79 19
to 0 79 19
Chile, 0 79 19
that 0 79 19
local 0 79 19
abuse 0 79 19
survivors 0 79 19
had 0 79 19
no 0 79 19
“proof” 0 79 19
against 0 79 19
a 0 79 19
bishop 0 79 19
who 0 79 19
allegedly 0 79 19
witnessed 0 79 19
abuse 0 79 19
and 0 79 19
failed 0 79 19
to 0 79 19
report 0 79 19
it. 0 79 19

Following 0 79 20
an 0 79 20
outcry, 1 79 20
Francis 0 79 20
apologized 0 79 20
for 0 79 20
his 0 79 20
remarks, 0 79 20
held 0 79 20
private 0 79 20
meetings 0 79 20
with 0 79 20
victims 0 79 20
at 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
Vatican, 0 79 20
and, 0 79 20
after 0 79 20
envoys 0 79 20
he 0 79 20
sent 0 79 20
to 0 79 20
Chile 0 79 20
backed 0 79 20
up 0 79 20
victims’ 0 79 20
claims, 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
entire 0 79 20
leadership 0 79 20
of 0 79 20
the 0 79 20
Chilean 0 79 20
Catholic 0 79 20
church 0 79 20
tendered 0 79 20
their 0 79 20
resignations. 0 79 20

to 1 79 21

expert 1 79 21
John 1 79 21

an 1 79 21
editor 1 79 21
at 1 79 21

website 1 79 21
Crux.com, 1 79 21
the 1 79 21
Catholic 1 79 21
Church 1 79 21
has 1 79 21
a 1 79 21
structural 1 79 21
problem 1 79 21
when 1 79 21
it 1 79 21

to 1 79 21

“Sixteen 1 79 22

the 1 79 22

the 1 79 22
direct 1 79 22
commission 1 79 22
of 1 79 22

Patel 0 84 5
questioned 0 84 5
why 0 84 5
this 0 84 5
was 0 84 5
happening. 0 84 5

The 0 84 6
organizers 0 84 6
replied 0 84 6
that 0 84 6
the 0 84 6
person 0 84 6
in 0 84 6
charge 0 84 6
of 0 84 6
tech 0 84 6
had 0 84 6
to 0 84 6
leave 0 84 6
early, 0 84 6
but 0 84 6
Patel 0 84 6
continued 0 84 6
to 0 84 6
claim 0 84 6
that 0 84 6
he 0 84 6
was 0 84 6
being 0 84 6
cut 0 84 6
off 0 84 6
because 0 84 6
the 0 84 6
audience 0 84 6
didn’t 0 84 6
like 0 84 6
his 0 84 6
jokes. 0 84 6

At 0 84 7
one 0 84 7
point, 0 84 7
one 0 84 7
organizer 0 84 7
told 0 84 7
Patel 0 84 7
he 0 84 7
was 0 84 7
being 0 84 7
disrespectful. 0 84 7

When 0 84 8
asked 0 84 8
for 0 84 8
closing 0 84 8
remarks, 0 84 8
Patel 0 84 8
responded: 0 84 8
“I’m 1 84 8

called 0 84 8
the 0 84 8

incorrect 0 84 8
in 0 84 8
ending 0 84 8
his 0 84 8

He 0 84 9
tried 0 84 9

until 0 84 9

that 0 401 5

gay 0 401 5
cannot 0 401 5
be 0 401 5
a 0 401 5

“no 1 401 5

even 0 404 23
more 0 404 23
amazing, 0 404 23

not 0 404 23
surprising, 0 404 23
is 0 404 23
that 0 404 23

Smith, 1 404 23
which 0 404 23
one 0 404 23
can 0 404 23
then 0 404 23
conclude 0 404 23
that 0 404 23
Gillum 0 404 23
knows 0 404 23
about 0 404 23

Smith. 0 404 24

“It’s 1 404 25
a 1 404 25
cracker 1 404 25

Smith 0 404 26
also 0 404 26
stated 0 404 26
that 0 404 26
the 0 404 26
campaign 0 404 26
has 0 404 26
“to 1 404 26
appeal 1 404 26
to 1 404 26
white 1 404 26
guilt.” 1 404 26

Good 1 404 27

that! 1 404 27

It 0 404 28
gets 0 404 28
worse 0 404 28
though. 0 404 28

Smith 0 404 29
says 0 404 29
that 0 404 29
Gillum 0 404 29
is 1 404 29
“a 1 404 29
progressive” 1 404 29
who 1 404 29
is 1 404 29
“a 1 404 29

NEW: 0 404 30
The 0 404 30
honesty 0 404 30
of 0 404 30
Gillum's 0 404 30
campaign 0 404 30
staff 0 404 30
on 0 404 30
undercover 0 404 30
video 0 404 30

refreshing, 0 404 30
especially 0 404 30

riding 1 412 20

top 0 412 21

we 0 412 22
have 0 412 22
an 1 412 22
ace 1 412 22
up 1 412 22

a 0 412 23
recent 0 412 23
study, 0 412 23
the 0 412 23
gun 0 412 23
issue 0 412 23
is 0 412 23
an 1 412 23
incredibly 1 412 23
powerful, 1 412 23
motivating 1 412 23
issue 1 412 23
in 1 412 23
politics. 1 412 23

The 0 412 24
study 0 412 24
reported 0 412 24
that 0 412 24
gun 0 412 24
owners 0 412 24
are 0 412 24
more 0 412 24
likely 0 412 24
to 0 412 24
show 0 412 24
up 0 412 24
to 0 412 24
vote 0 412 24
than 0 412 24
those 0 412 24
who 0 412 24
support 0 412 24
gun 0 412 24
control. 0 412 24

This 0 412 25
is 0 412 25
encouraging 0 412 25
news. 0 412 25

Having 0 412 26
said 0 412 26
that, 0 412 26
gun 0 412 26
owners 0 412 26
can’t 0 412 26
make 0 412 26
informed 0 412 26
choices 0 412 26
if 0 412 26
they 0 412 26
don’t 0 412 26
know 0 412 26
who 0 412 26
the 0 412 26

neither 1 413 2

Tlaib 0 413 4

to 0 413 4
be 0 413 4
an 0 413 4

against 1 413 4
the 0 413 4

only 0 413 4
democracy. 0 413 4

The 0 413 5
House 0 413 5
is 0 413 5
likely 0 413 5
to 0 413 5
do 0 413 5
all 0 413 5
it 0 413 5
can 0 413 5
to 0 413 5
roll 0 413 5
back 0 413 5
President 0 413 5

public 0 413 5
faces 0 413 5
of 0 413 5
the 0 413 5
effort. 0 413 5

According 0 413 6
to 0 413 6
the 0 413 6
JTA, 0 413 6
when 0 413 6
Tlaib 0 413 6
was 0 413 6
asked 0 413 6
if 0 413 6
she 0 413 6
would 0 413 6
vote 0 413 6
against 0 413 6
military 0 413 6
aid 0 413 6
to 0 413 6
Israel, 0 413 6
Tlaib 0 413 6
responded: 0 413 6
“Absolutely, 0 413 6
if 0 413 6
it 0 413 6
has 0 413 6
something 0 413 6
to 0 413 6

access 0 413 6

having 0 413 6
justice. 0 413 6

For 1 413 7
me, 1 413 7
U.S. 1 413 7
aid 1 413 7
should 1 413 7
be 1 413 7
leverage. 1 413 7

I 1 413 8
will 1 413 8
be 1 413 8
using 1 413 8
my 1 413 8
position 1 413 8
in 1 413 8
Congress 1 413 8
so 1 413 8
that 1 413 8
no 1 413 8
country, 1 413 8
not 1 413 8
one, 1 413 8
should 1 413 8
be 1 413 8
able 1 413 8
to 1 413 8
get 1 413 8
aid 1 413 8
from 1 413 8
the 1 413 8
U.S. 1 413 8
when 1 413 8
they 1 413 8
still 1 413 8
promote 1 413 8
that 1 413 8
kind 1 413 8

What 0 413 9
kind 0 413 9
of 0 413 9
injustice? 0 413 9

Tlaib, 1 413 10
of 1 413 10
course, 1 413 10
had 1 413 10
nothing 1 413 10

that 1 413 10
regularly 1 413 10
features 1 413 10
on 1 413 10
Palestinian 1 413 10
television. 1 413 10

She 0 413 11
did 0 413 11
say, 0 413 11
however, 0 413 11
that 0 413 11
she 0 413 11
favors 0 413 11
a 0 413 11
one-state, 0 413 11
not 0 413 11
two-state, 0 413 11
“solution” 0 413 11
to 0 413 11
the 0 413 11
Israeli-Palestinian 0 413 11
conflict: 0 413 11
“One 0 413 11
state. 0 413 11

It 0 413 12
has 0 413 12
to 0 413 12
be 0 413 12
one 0 413 12
state. 0 413 12

Separate 0 413 13
but 0 413 13
equal 0 413 13
does 0 413 13
not 0 413 13
work. 0 413 13

I’m 0 413 14
only 0 413 14
42 0 413 14
years 0 413 14
old 0 413 14
but 0 413 14
my 0 413 14
teachers 0 413 14
were 0 413 14
of 0 413 14
that 0 413 14
generation 0 413 14
that 0 413 14
marched 0 413 14
with 0 413 14
Martin 0 413 14
Luther 0 413 14
King. 0 413 14

This 0 413 15
whole 0 413 15
idea 0 413 15
of 0 413 15
a 0 413 15
two-state 0 413 15
solution, 0 413 15
it 1 413 15
doesn’t 1 413 15
work.” 1 413 15

Indeed 0 413 16
it 0 413 16
doesn’t. 0 413 16

A 0 413 17
Palestinian 0 413 17
state 0 413 17
would 0 413 17
be 0 413 17
a 0 413 17
new 0 413 17
base 0 413 17
for 0 413 17
renewed 0 413 17
jihad 0 413 17
attacks 0 413 17
against 0 413 17
Israel. 0 413 17

But 0 413 18
a 0 413 18
“one-state 0 413 18
solution” 0 413 18
would 0 413 18
be 0 413 18
even 0 413 18
worse, 0 413 18
unless 0 413 18
that 0 413 18
state 0 413 18
is 0 413 18
the 0 413 18
current 0 413 18
State 0 413 18
of 0 413 18
Israel, 0 413 18
but 0 413 18
that 0 413 18
is 0 413 18
not 0 413 18
the 0 413 18
one 0 413 18
state 0 413 18
Tlaib 0 413 18
has 0 413 18
in 0 413 18
mind. 0 413 18

She 0 413 19
is 0 413 19
calling 0 413 19
for 0 413 19
an 0 413 19
Israeli/Palestinian 0 413 19
state 0 413 19
that 0 413 19
would 0 413 19
not 0 413 19
be 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
Jewish 0 413 19
State 0 413 19
or 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
homeland 0 413 19
for 0 413 19
the 0 413 19
Jewish 0 413 19
people, 0 413 19
but 0 413 19
a 0 413 19
federation 0 413 19
in 0 413 19
which 0 413 19
Palestinians 0 413 19
would 0 413 19
soon 0 413 19
overwhelm 0 413 19
Jews 0 413 19
demographically. 0 413 19

Progressive 0 413 20
denial 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
their 0 413 20
rights 0 413 20
would 0 413 20
soon 0 413 20
follow: 0 413 20
as 0 413 20
I 0 413 20
show 0 413 20
in 0 413 20
my 0 413 20
book 0 413 20

From 0 413 20
Muhammad 0 413 20
to 0 413 20

there 0 413 20
has 0 413 20
never 0 413 20
been 0 413 20
a 0 413 20
majority 0 413 20
Muslim 0 413 20
nation 0 413 20
in 0 413 20
which 0 413 20
Jews 0 413 20
enjoyed 0 413 20
equality 0 413 20
of 0 413 20
rights 0 413 20
with 0 413 20
Muslims. 0 413 20

Tlaib’s 0 413 21
unitary 0 413 21
state 0 413 21
would 0 413 21
be 0 413 21
no 0 413 21
different. 0 413 21

The 0 413 22
hijabed 0 413 22
(and 0 413 22
therefore 0 413 22
pro-Sharia) 0 413 22
Ilhan 0 413 22
Omar, 0 413 22
meanwhile, 0 413 22
is 1 413 22
even 1 413 22
more 1 413 22

than 1 413 22
Tlaib. 1 413 22

According 0 413 23
to 0 413 23

in 0 413 23

Challenged 0 413 24
about 0 413 24
this 0 413 24

much 0 413 24
more 0 413 24
recently, 0 413 24
she 1 413 24
doubled 1 413 24
down 1 413 24
and 1 413 24
attacked 1 413 24
the 0 413 24
man 0 413 24
who 0 413 24
called 0 413 24
attention 0 413 24
to 0 413 24
the 0 413 24

is 1 413 26
much, 1 413 26
much 1 413 26
worse 1 413 26
about 1 413 26

David 0 413 27
Steinberg 0 413 27
of 0 413 27
PJ 0 413 27
Media 0 413 27
has 0 413 27
done 0 413 27
extraordinary 1 413 27
work 1 413 27
in 0 413 27
shedding 0 413 27
light 0 413 27
on 0 413 27
aspects 0 413 27
of 0 413 27
Omar’s 0 413 27
record 0 413 27
that 0 413 27
the 0 413 27
establishment 0 413 27

has 0 413 27
steadfastly 1 413 27
ignored. 1 413 27

Steinberg 0 413 28
reports 0 413 28
that 0 413 28
Omar 0 413 28
has 0 413 28
“faced 0 413 28
allegations 0 413 28
-- 0 413 28
soon 0 413 28
backed 0 413 28
by 0 413 28
a 0 413 28
remarkable 0 413 28
amount 0 413 28
of 0 413 28
evidence 0 413 28
-- 0 413 28
that 0 413 28
she 0 413 28
had 0 413 28
married 0 413 28
her 0 413 28
own 0 413 28
brother 0 413 28
in 0 413 28
2009, 0 413 28
and 0 413 28
was 0 413 28
still 0 413 28
legally 0 413 28
his 0 413 28
wife. 0 413 28

They 0 413 29
officially 0 413 29
divorced 0 413 29
in 0 413 29
December 0 413 29
2017. 0 413 29

The 0 413 30
motivation 0 413 30
for 0 413 30
the 0 413 30
marriage 0 413 30
remains 0 413 30
unclear. 0 413 30

However, 0 413 31
the 0 413 31
totality 0 413 31
of 0 413 31
the 0 413 31
evidence 0 413 31
points 0 413 31
to 0 413 31
possible 0 413 31
immigration 0 413 31
fraud 0 413 31

What’s 0 413 31
more, 0 413 31
she 0 413 31
swore 0 413 31
to 0 413 31
apparent 0 413 31
falsehoods 0 413 31
in 0 413 31
court. 0 413 31

But 0 413 32
Leftists 0 413 32
rarely 0 413 32
have 0 413 32
to 0 413 32
answer 0 413 32
for 0 413 32
their 0 413 32
corruption, 0 413 32
and 0 413 32
in 0 413 32
a 0 413 32
Democrat 0 413 32
House, 0 413 32
Omar 0 413 32
will 0 413 32
much 0 413 32
more 0 413 32
likely 0 413 32
be 0 413 32
celebrated 0 413 32
than 0 413 32
investigated. 0 413 32

She 0 413 33
and 0 413 33
Tlaib 0 413 33
will 0 413 33
enjoy 0 413 33
establishment 0 413 33

accolades 0 413 33
as 0 413 33
they 0 413 33
pursue 0 413 33
their 0 413 33
hard-Left, 0 413 33
anti-American, 0 413 33
anti-Israel 0 413 33
agenda. 0 413 33

Their 0 413 34
presence 0 413 34
in 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
House 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
Representatives 0 413 34
may 0 413 34
be 0 413 34
evidence 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
“diversity,” 0 413 34
but 0 413 34
it 0 413 34
is 0 413 34
also 0 413 34
a 0 413 34
disquieting 0 413 34
sign 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
the 0 413 34
continued 0 413 34
dominance 0 413 34
of 0 413 34
identity 0 413 34
politics, 0 413 34

the 1 413 34

of 0 413 34

Forthrightly 1 413 35
pro-America, 1 413 35
pro-Israel 1 413 35
candidates 1 413 35
would 1 413 35
stand 1 413 35
little 1 413 35

And 1 413 35

that 1 413 35

is 1 413 35

indicative 1 413 35

of 1 413 35

a 1 413 35

The 0 85 3
conversation 0 85 3
began 0 85 3
normally, 0 85 3
with 0 85 3
Clinton 0 85 3
hypocritically 1 85 3
toeing 1 85 3
the 0 85 3
progressive 0 85 3
line 0 85 3
of 0 85 3
identity 0 85 3
politics 0 85 3
by 0 85 3
explaining 0 85 3
how 0 85 3
each 0 85 3
of 0 85 3
the 0 85 3
groups 0 85 3
are 0 85 3
different 0 85 3

can 0 85 3
be 0 85 3
managed 0 85 3
by 0 85 3
the 0 85 3
same 0 85 3
liberal 0 85 3
movement: 0 85 3

“What’s 0 85 4
often 0 85 4
called 0 85 4
political 0 85 4
correctness 0 85 4
is 0 85 4
politeness,” 0 85 4
Clinton 0 85 4
said. 0 85 4

“It’s 0 85 5
not 0 85 5
being 0 85 5
rude 0 85 5
and 0 85 5
insulting 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
people. 0 85 5

It’s 0 85 6
respecting 0 85 6
the 0 85 6
diversity 0 85 6
that 0 85 6
we 0 85 6
have 0 85 6

“The 0 85 7

Childish, 1 85 10
indeed. 1 85 10

Insulting, 1 85 11
indeed. 1 85 11

Just 0 85 12
30 0 85 12
seconds 0 85 12
later, 0 85 12
as 0 85 12
Swisher 0 85 12
asked: 0 85 12

“what 0 85 13
do 0 85 13
you 0 85 13
think 0 85 13
of 0 85 13
Cory 0 85 13
Booker… 0 85 13
saying 0 85 13
‘kick 1 85 13
them 1 85 13
in 1 85 13
the 1 85 13
shins,’ 1 85 13
essentially…” 0 85 13
incorrectly 0 85 13
recalling 0 85 13
Eric 0 85 13
Holder’s 0 85 13
recent 0 85 13
comments. 0 85 13

Which 0 85 14
Clinton 0 85 14
quickly 0 85 14
corrected: 0 85 14

“Well 0 85 15
that 0 85 15
was 0 85 15
Eric 0 85 15
Holder…” 0 85 15

Adding, 0 85 16
rather 1 85 16
extraordinarily, 1 85 16

“Yeah, 0 85 17
I 0 85 17
know 0 85 17
they 0 85 17
all 0 85 17
look 0 85 17
alike,” 0 85 17
Clinton 0 85 17
joked, 0 85 17
triggering 0 85 17
howls 0 85 17
of 0 85 17
laughter 0 85 17
from 0 85 17
the 0 85 17
apparently 0 85 17
mind-numbed 0 85 17
audience. 0 85 17

Sorry 1 85 18
Hillary, 1 85 18
we 1 85 18
don’t 1 85 18
think 1 85 18
they 1 85 18
look 1 85 18
anything 1 85 18
alike. 1 85 18

Or 1 85 19
did 1 85 19
you 1 85 19
mean 1 85 19
all 1 85 19
black 1 85 19
people? 1 85 19

Finally, 0 85 20
we 0 85 20
have 0 85 20
one 0 85 20
question 0 85 20
– 0 85 20
what 0 85 20
would 0 85 20
have 0 85 20
happened 0 85 20
if 0 85 20
Trump 0 85 20
said 0 85 20
it? 0 85 20

American 1 85 20

eloquently, 1 85 20

Clinton 1 85 20

appears 1 85 20

to 1 85 20

benefit 1 85 20

from 1 85 20

her 1 85 20

progressive 1 85 20

– 1 85 20

it 1 85 20

is 1 85 20

the 1 85 20

only 1 85 20

thing 1 85 20

that 1 85 20

protects 1 85 20

her 1 85 20

from 1 85 20

getting 1 85 20

the 1 85 20

‘Roseanne 1 85 20

treatment’, 1 85 20

and 1 85 20

not 1 85 20

being 1 85 20

dismissed 1 85 20

in 1 85 20

disgrace. 1 85 20

What 0 416 15
I 0 416 15

Furthermore, 0 416 17
why 0 416 17
are 0 416 17
Democrats 0 416 17
such 0 416 17
as 0 416 17
Keith 0 416 17

has 0 416 17
a 0 416 17
long 0 416 17
history 0 416 17
of 0 416 17
friendship 0 416 17
with 0 416 17
Farrakhan, 0 416 17
despite 0 416 17
the 0 416 17
lies 0 416 17
he 0 416 17
tells 0 416 17
to 0 416 17
try 0 416 17
and 0 416 17
distance 0 416 17
himself 0 416 17
from 0 416 17
Farrakhan 0 416 17

Here’s 0 427 12
what 0 427 12
the 0 427 12
military 0 427 12
was 0 427 12
REALLY 0 427 12
up 0 427 12
to, 0 427 12
when 0 427 12
CNN 0 427 12

The 0 427 15
Trumpinator: 0 427 15
every 0 427 15
time 0 427 15
his 0 427 15
rivals 0 427 15
think 0 427 15
they’ve 0 427 15
got 0 427 15
him 0 427 15
down 0 427 15
and 0 427 15
out, 0 427 15
he 0 427 15
stands 0 427 15
back 0 427 15
up 0 427 15
and 0 427 15
keeps 0 427 15
on 0 427 15
coming. 0 427 15

They 0 427 16
laughed 0 427 16
when 0 427 16
he 0 427 16
announced 0 427 16
his 0 427 16
candidacy. 0 427 16

They 0 427 17
thought 0 427 17
he 0 427 17
was 0 427 17
just 0 427 17
some 0 427 17
kind 0 427 17

They 1 427 18
couldn’t 1 427 18
have 1 427 18
been 1 427 18
more 1 427 18
wrong. 1 427 18

He 0 427 19
survived 0 427 19
the 0 427 19
primaries 0 427 19
and 0 427 19
got 0 427 19

He 0 427 20
knocked 1 427 20
out 1 427 20
Crooked 0 427 20
Hillary. 0 427 20

He 0 427 21
beat 0 427 21

at 0 427 21
their 0 427 21
own 0 427 21

their 0 427 21
ratings 0 427 21
are 0 427 21
now 0 427 21
circling 0 427 21
the 0 427 21
toilet. 0 427 21

Mueller 0 427 22
and 0 427 22
the 0 427 22
Dossier 0 427 22
aren’t 0 427 22
just 0 427 22
coming 0 427 22
up 0 427 22
empty, 0 427 22
they’re 0 427 22

all 0 427 22
the 0 427 22

And 0 427 23
Trump 0 427 23
is 0 427 23
still 0 427 23
keeping 0 427 23
promises, 0 427 23
and 0 427 23
getting 0 427 23
things 0 427 23
done. 0 427 23

The 0 427 24
economy 0 427 24
is 0 427 24
doing 0 427 24
exactly 0 427 24
what 0 427 24

Infowars' 0 433 3

went 0 433 4

New 0 433 28

Times, 0 433 28
you're 0 433 28
lying. 1 433 28

Every 0 433 29
media 0 433 29
outlet 0 433 29
from 0 433 29
the 0 433 29
Associated 0 433 29
Press 0 433 29
to 0 433 29
NBC, 0 433 29
you're 0 433 29
lying 1 433 29
when 0 433 29
you 0 433 29
say 0 433 29
the 0 433 29
video 0 433 29
was 0 433 29
doctored 0 433 29
and 0 433 29
that 0 433 29
Acosta 0 433 29
didn't 0 433 29
touch 0 433 29
the 0 433 29
woman. 0 433 29

At 0 433 30
least 0 433 30
C-SPAN 0 433 30
is 0 433 30
neutral 0 433 30
in 0 433 30
the 0 433 30
matter 0 433 30
and 0 433 30
simply 0 433 30
let 0 433 30
the 0 433 30
video 0 433 30
reprove 0 433 30
every 0 433 30
single 0 433 30
one 0 433 30
of 0 433 30
them. 0 433 30

But 0 433 31
it's 0 433 31
more 0 433 31
than 0 433 31
that, 0 433 31
self-proclaimed 1 433 31
"fact 1 433 31
checkers" 1 433 31
like 0 433 31
Snopes 0 433 31
simply 0 433 31
posted 0 433 31
an 0 433 31
Associated 0 433 31
Press 0 433 31
article, 0 433 31
which 0 433 31
clearly 0 433 31
biased 0 433 31
towards 0 433 31
indicating 0 433 31
the 0 433 31
video 0 433 31
was 0 433 31
"doctored" 0 433 31
by 0 433 31
saying 0 433 31
it 0 433 31
was 0 433 31
sped 0 433 31
up, 0 433 31
but 0 433 31
that's 0 433 31
not 0 433 31
doctoring. 0 433 31

Doctoring 0 433 32
is 0 433 32
when 0 433 32
you 0 433 32
manipulate 0 433 32
the 0 433 32
content 0 433 32
to 0 433 32
misconstrue 0 433 32
the 0 433 32
reality 0 433 32
of 0 433 32
what 0 433 32
took 0 433 32
place. 0 433 32

If 1 433 33
you 1 433 33
want 1 433 33
to 1 433 33
see 1 433 33
doctoring, 1 433 33
go 1 433 33
to 1 433 33
0:58 1 433 33
of 1 433 33
the 1 433 33
video 1 433 33
above, 1 433 33
and 1 433 33
don't 1 433 33
be 1 433 33
drinking 1 433 33
anything 1 433 33
when 1 433 33
you 1 433 33
do 1 433 33
because 1 433 33
it's 1 433 33
hilarious. 1 433 33

But 0 433 34
it 0 433 34
isn't 0 433 34
just 0 433 34
Snopes 0 433 34
or 0 433 34
Politifact 0 433 34
and 0 433 34
outlets 0 433 34
like 0 433 34
that. 0 433 34

Take, 0 433 35
for 0 433 35
instance, 0 433 35
websites 0 433 35
like 0 433 35
MediaBiasFactCheck.com, 0 433 35
whom 0 433 35
I 0 433 35
had 0 433 35
to 0 433 35
have 0 433 35
my 0 433 35
attorneys 0 433 35
send 0 433 35
a 0 433 35
letter 0 433 35
for 0 433 35
their 0 433 35
libel 0 433 35
and 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
didn't 0 433 35
just 0 433 35
correct 0 433 35
it, 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
removed 0 433 35
it 0 433 35
entirely 0 433 35
because 0 433 35
they 0 433 35
knew 0 433 35
I 0 433 35
was 0 433 35
two 0 433 35
days 0 433 35
away 0 433 35
from 0 433 35
filing 0 433 35
a 0 433 35
lawsuit 0 433 35
against 0 433 35
them. 0 433 35

MBFC 0 433 36
actually 0 433 36
called 0 433 36
CNN 0 433 36
"left 1 433 36
biased," 1 433 36
which 0 433 36
is 0 433 36
correct 0 433 36
but 0 433 36
followed 0 433 36
up 0 433 36
with: 0 433 36

Overall, 0 433 37
we 0 433 37
rate 0 433 37
CNN 0 433 37
left 0 433 37
biased 0 433 37
based 0 433 37
on 0 433 37
story 0 433 37
selection 0 433 37
that 0 433 37
often 0 433 37
favors 0 433 37
the 0 433 37
left. 0 433 37

We 0 433 38
rate 0 433 38
them 0 433 38
Mixed 0 433 38
for 0 433 38
factual 0 433 38

However, 0 433 39
CNN’s 0 433 39
straight 0 433 39

Why 0 433 44
yes, 0 433 44
yes, 0 433 44
he 0 433 44
did! 0 433 44

Not 0 433 45
only 0 433 45
that 0 433 45
but 0 433 45
it 0 433 45
appears 0 433 45
the 0 433 45

telling 0 433 45

to 0 433 46
comment 0 433 46
on 0 433 46
the 0 433 46
subject. 0 433 46

It 0 433 47
isn't 0 433 47

though. 0 433 47

This 0 433 49
is 0 433 49

to 0 433 49
be 0 433 49
an 0 433 49

at 0 433 49

what 0 433 49
I 0 433 49
was 0 433 49

to 0 433 49
determine 0 433 49
transparency 0 433 49
of 0 433 49

Instead, 0 433 50
they 0 433 50
not 0 433 50
only 0 433 50
do 0 433 50
that, 0 433 50

they 0 433 50
go 0 433 50

need 0 433 52
to 0 433 52
update 0 433 52
this 0 433 52
in 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
light 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
obvious 0 433 52
lies 1 433 52
and 0 433 52
editing 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
Acosta 0 433 52
video 0 433 52
and 0 433 52
decades 0 433 52
of 0 433 52
documented, 0 433 52
outright 1 433 52
lies 1 433 52
and 0 433 52
propaganda 1 433 52
by 0 433 52
the 0 433 52
Clown 1 433 52
News 1 433 52
Network, 1 433 52
but 0 433 52
you 0 433 52
can't 0 433 52
expect 0 433 52
real 0 433 52
transparency 0 433 52
from 0 433 52
an 0 433 52
outlet 0 433 52
like 0 433 52
Newsguard 0 433 52
whose 0 433 52
writers 0 433 52
aren't 0 433 52
transparent 0 433 52
about 0 433 52
their 0 433 52
own 0 433 52
political 0 433 52
bias, 0 433 52
can 0 433 52
you? 0 433 52

Nope, 0 433 53
you 1 433 53
can't, 1 433 53
and 0 433 53
you 1 433 53
can't 1 433 53
expect 0 433 53
it 0 433 53
when 0 433 53
some 0 433 53
of 0 433 53
those 0 433 53
writers 0 433 53
write 0 433 53
for 0 433 53
other 0 433 53
publications 0 433 53
that 0 433 53
don't 0 433 53
measure 0 433 53
up 0 433 53
to 0 433 53
NewsGuard's 0 433 53
standards 0 433 53
either. 0 433 53

The 0 433 54
reason 0 433 54
this 0 433 54
little 0 433 54
incident 0 433 54
shouldn't 0 433 54
be 0 433 54
let 0 433 54
go 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
so 0 433 54
soon 0 433 54
is 0 433 54
that 0 433 54
it 0 433 54
is 0 433 54
one 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
the 0 433 54
clearest 0 433 54
demonstrations 0 433 54
of 0 433 54
the 0 433 54
media's 0 433 54
bias, 0 433 54
which 0 433 54
we 0 433 54
all 0 433 54
have, 0 433 54
lies 1 433 54
and 0 433 54
propaganda. 1 433 54

It 0 433 55
should 0 433 55
be 0 433 55
used 0 433 55
over 0 433 55
and 0 433 55
over 0 433 55
in 0 433 55
article 0 433 55
after 0 433 55
article 0 433 55
to 0 433 55
remind 0 433 55
people 0 433 55
about 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
total 1 433 55
dishonesty 1 433 55
and 0 433 55
complete 1 433 55
disregard 1 433 55
for 0 433 55
reporting 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
facts 0 433 55
by 0 433 55
outlets 0 433 55
such 0 433 55
as 0 433 55
CNN 0 433 55
and 0 433 55
to 0 433 55
not 0 433 55
blindly 0 433 55
trust 0 433 55
self-proclaimed 1 433 55
fact-checkers 1 433 55
who 0 433 55
will 0 433 55
not 0 433 55
tell 0 433 55
you 0 433 55
the 0 433 55
truth 0 433 55
either. 0 433 55

CNN 0 433 56
has 0 433 56
lost 1 433 56
its 1 433 56
mind 1 433 56
to 0 433 56
the 0 433 56
point 0 433 56
that 0 433 56
they 0 433 56
are 0 433 56
suing 0 433 56
over 0 433 56
Acosta 0 433 56
losing 0 433 56
his 0 433 56
press 0 433 56
pass. 0 433 56

He 1 433 57
was 1 433 57
their 1 433 57
inside 1 433 57
boy, 1 433 57
after 0 433 57
all. 0 433 57

But 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
real 0 433 58
irony 0 433 58
here 0 433 58
is 0 433 58
that 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
media 0 433 58
labeled 0 433 58
Paul 0 433 58
Joseph 0 433 58
Watson 0 433 58
and 0 433 58
Infowars 0 433 58
as 0 433 58
"conspiracy 1 433 58
theorists" 1 433 58
and 0 433 58
yet, 0 433 58
PJW 0 433 58
has 0 433 58
exposed 0 433 58
their 0 433 58
blatant 1 433 58
conspiracy 1 433 58
to 0 433 58
smear 0 433 58
President 0 433 58
Trump, 0 433 58
Sarah 0 433 58
Sanders 0 433 58
and 0 433 58
the 0 433 58
White 0 433 58
House 0 433 58
aide. 0 433 58

And 0 433 59
Jim 0 433 59
Acosta 0 433 59
believes 0 433 59
he 0 433 59
and 0 433 59
CNN 0 433 59

with 0 433 59

and 0 433 59

doesn't. 0 433 59

Yeah, 0 433 60
right! 0 433 60

I'm 0 433 61
sorry 0 433 61
Jim, 0 433 61
I 0 433 61
can't 0 433 61

mishandling 0 434 43
in 0 434 43
Florida, 0 434 43
this 0 434 43
is 0 434 43
the 0 434 43
first 0 434 43
that 0 434 43
has 0 434 43
been 0 434 43
referred 0 434 43
to 0 434 43
the 0 434 43
federal 0 434 43
government. 0 434 43

While 0 434 44
Democrats 0 434 44
seem 0 434 44
to 0 434 44
have 0 434 44
told 0 434 44

It 1 434 45

So 0 438 41

far, 0 438 41

we 0 438 41

are 0 438 41

being 0 438 41

told 0 438 41

they 0 438 41

celebrate 0 438 41

their 0 438 41

but 0 438 41

no 0 438 41

reports 0 438 41

have 0 438 41

been 0 438 41

issued 0 438 41

they 0 438 41

what 0 439 1
many 0 439 1

They 0 439 2

of 0 439 2
people 0 439 2
that 0 439 2

are 0 439 2
conservative. 0 439 2

Other 0 439 3
than 0 439 3
that, 0 439 3
they 0 439 3

they 0 439 4

even 0 439 4
going 0 439 4
so 0 439 4
far 0 439 4
as 0 439 4
to 0 439 4
file 0 439 4
an 0 439 4

One 0 439 5
would 0 439 5
think 0 439 5
these 0 439 5

would 0 439 5

If 0 439 6

it 0 439 7
seems 0 439 7
that 0 439 7

However, 0 439 38
several 0 439 38
prominent 0 439 38
media 0 439 38
members 0 439 38
– 0 439 38
such 0 439 38
as 0 439 38
Pulitzer 1 439 38
Prize-winning 1 439 38
Watergate 1 439 38
journalist 1 439 38
Bob 1 439 38
Woodward 1 439 38
– 1 439 38
have 1 439 38
criticized 1 439 38
CNN 1 439 38
over 1 439 38
the 1 439 38
lawsuit. 1 439 38

As 0 439 39
they 0 439 39
should. 0 439 39

It's 0 439 40
frivolous, 1 439 40
but 0 439 40
because 0 439 40
they 0 439 40
are 0 439 40
immature 1 439 40
children 1 439 40
over 0 439 40
at 0 439 40
CNN, 0 439 40
it's 0 439 40
not 0 439 40
surprising, 0 439 40
and 0 439 40
frankly, 0 439 40
it's 0 439 40
no 0 439 40
surprise 0 439 40
coming 0 439 40
from 0 439 40

"grandstanding." 0 439 41

I 0 439 42

call 0 439 42

"This 0 439 43

just 0 439 43
more 0 439 43

said. 0 439 43

“CNN, 0 439 44

asked 0 439 45
the 0 439 45

two 0 439 45
questions 0 439 45
— 0 439 45

of 0 439 45
which 0 439 45
the 0 439 45
President 0 439 45
answered 0 439 45
— 0 439 45
he 0 439 45
physically 0 439 45

that 0 439 45

Of 0 439 47

CNN 0 439 47
was 0 439 47
thrilled 0 439 47
as 0 439 47

the 0 443 19

has 0 443 19
been 0 443 19
told. 0 443 19

Sources 0 443 20
have 0 443 20
said 0 443 20
Manafort 0 443 20
went 0 443 20
to 0 443 20

Assange 0 443 20
in 0 443 20
2013, 0 443 20

in 0 443 20
spring 0 443 20
2016 0 443 20
– 0 443 20
during 0 443 20
the 0 443 20
period 0 443 20
when 0 443 20
he 0 443 20
was 0 443 20

the 0 443 20
White 0 443 20
House. 0 443 20

It 0 443 21
is 0 443 21
unclear 0 443 21
why 0 443 21
Manafort 0 443 21
wanted 0 443 21
to 0 443 21
see 0 443 21
Assange 0 443 21
and 0 443 21
what 0 443 21
was 0 443 21
discussed. 0 443 21

But 0 443 22
the 0 443 22
last 0 443 22
meeting 0 443 22
is 0 443 22
likely 0 443 22
to 0 443 22
come 0 443 22
under 0 443 22
scrutiny 0 443 22

A 0 443 23
well-placed 0 443 23
source 0 443 23
has 0 443 23
told 0 443 23
the 0 443 23
Guardian 0 443 23
that 0 443 23
Manafort 0 443 23
went 0 443 23
to 0 443 23

Assange 0 443 23
around 0 443 23
March 0 443 23
2016. 0 443 23

Months 0 443 24
later 0 443 24

Russian 0 443 24
intelligence 0 443 24
officers. 0 443 24

Manafort, 0 443 25
69, 0 443 25
denies 0 443 25
involvement 0 443 25
in 0 443 25
the 0 443 25
hack 0 443 25
and 0 443 25
says 0 443 25
the 1 443 25
claim 1 443 25
is 1 443 25
“100% 1 443 25
false”. 1 443 25

His 0 443 26
lawyers 0 443 26
declined 0 443 26
to 0 443 26
answer 0 443 26
the 0 443 26
Guardian’s 0 443 26
questions 0 443 26
about 0 443 26
the 0 443 26
visits. 0 443 26

The 0 443 27
piece 0 443 27
did 0 443 27
not 0 443 27
include 0 443 27
the 0 443 27
public 0 443 27
denial 0 443 27
Wikileaks 0 443 27
issued 0 443 27

its 0 443 27
5.4 0 443 27
million 0 443 27

one 0 443 27
and 0 443 27
a 0 443 27
half 0 443 27
hour 0 443 27
before 0 443 27
it 0 443 27
was 0 443 27
published. 0 443 27

The 0 443 28
Guardian 0 443 28
piece 0 443 28
came 0 443 28
at 0 443 28
a 0 443 28
critical 0 443 28
moment. 0 443 28

Currently 0 443 29
the 0 443 29
U.K. 0 443 29
and 0 443 29
Ecuador 0 443 29
conspire 0 443 29
to 0 443 29
deliver 0 443 29
Julian 0 443 29
Assange 0 443 29
to 0 443 29
U.S. 0 443 29
authorities. 0 443 29

On 0 443 30
Monday 0 443 30
special 0 443 30
counsel 0 443 30
Robert 0 443 30
Mueller 0 443 30
said 0 443 30
Manafort 0 443 30
lied 0 443 30
to 0 443 30
investigators, 0 443 30
violating 0 443 30
his 0 443 30
recent 0 443 30
plea 0 443 30
deal. 0 443 30

The 0 443 31
new 0 443 31
sensational 1 443 31
claim 1 443 31
was 0 443 31
immediately 0 443 31
picked 0 443 31
up 0 443 31
by 0 443 31
prominent 0 443 31
reporters 0 443 31
and 0 443 31
major 0 443 31
main 0 443 31
stream 0 443 31
outlets. 0 443 31

They 0 443 32
distributed 0 443 32
is 0 443 32
as 0 443 32
a 0 443 32
factual 0 443 32
account. 0 443 32

It 0 443 33
is 0 443 33
likely 0 443 33
that 0 443 33
millions 0 443 33
of 0 443 33
people 0 443 33
took 0 443 33
note 0 443 33
of 0 443 33
its 0 443 33
claim. 0 443 33

But 1 443 34
several 1 443 34
people 1 443 34
who 1 443 34
had 1 443 34
followed 1 443 34
the 1 443 34
Russiagate 1 443 34
fairytale 1 443 34
and 1 443 34
the 1 443 34
Mueller 1 443 34
investigation 1 443 34
were 1 443 34
immediately 1 443 34
suspicious 1 443 34
of 1 443 34
the 1 443 34
Guardian 1 443 34
claim. 1 443 34

The 1 443 35
story 1 443 35
was 1 443 35
weakly 1 443 35
sourced 1 443 35
and 1 443 35
included 1 443 35
some 1 443 35
details 1 443 35
that 1 443 35
seemed 1 443 35
unlikely 1 443 35
to 1 443 35
be 1 443 35
true. 1 443 35

Glenn 0 443 36
Greenwald 0 443 36
noted 0 443 36
that 0 443 36
the 0 443 36
Ecuadorian 0 443 36
embassy 0 443 36
is 0 443 36
under 0 443 36
heavy 0 443 36
CCTV 0 443 36
surveillance. 0 443 36

There 0 443 37
are 0 443 37
several 0 443 37
guards, 0 443 37
and 0 443 37
visitors 0 443 37
have 0 443 37
to 0 443 37
provide 0 443 37
their 0 443 37
identity 0 443 37
to 0 443 37
enter 0 443 37
it. 0 443 37

Every 0 443 38
visit 0 443 38
is 0 443 38
logged. 0 443 38

If 0 443 39
Manafort 0 443 39
had 0 443 39
really 0 443 39
visited 0 443 39
Assange, 0 443 39
it 0 443 39
would 0 443 39
have 0 443 39
long 0 443 39
been 0 443 39
known: 0 443 39

In 1 443 40
sum, 1 443 40
the 1 443 40
Guardian 1 443 40
published 1 443 40
a 1 443 40
story 1 443 40
today 1 443 40
that 1 443 40
it 1 443 40
knew 1 443 40
would 1 443 40
explode 1 443 40
into 1 443 40
all 1 443 40
sorts 1 443 40
of 1 443 40
viral 1 443 40
benefits 1 443 40
for 1 443 40
the 1 443 40
paper 1 443 40
and 1 443 40
its 1 443 40
reporters 1 443 40
even 1 443 40
though 1 443 40
there 1 443 40
are 1 443 40
gaping 1 443 40
holes 1 443 40
and 1 443 40
highly 1 443 40
sketchy 1 443 40
aspects 1 443 40
to 1 443 40
the 1 443 40
story. 1 443 40

Moreover, 1 443 41
the 1 443 41
main 1 443 41
author 1 443 41
of 1 443 41
the 1 443 41
story, 1 443 41
Luke 1 443 41
Harding, 1 443 41
is 1 443 41
known 1 443 41
to 1 443 41
be 1 443 41
a 1 443 41
notorious 1 443 41
fraud, 1 443 41
a 1 443 41
russo-phobe 1 443 41
intelligence 1 443 41
asset 1 443 41
with 1 443 41
a 1 443 41
personal 1 443 41

towards 1 443 41
Assange 1 443 41
and 1 443 41
Wikileaks. 1 443 41

A 0 443 42
year 0 443 42
ago 0 443 42
an 0 443 42
important 0 443 42
Moon 0 443 42
of 0 443 42
Alabama 0 443 42
piece 0 443 42
- 0 443 42
From 0 443 42

To 0 443 42
Russia-gate 0 443 42

Harding: 0 443 42

The 0 443 43
people 0 443 43
who 0 443 43
promote 0 443 43
the 1 443 43
"Russian 1 443 43
influence" 1 443 43
nonsense 1 443 43
are 0 443 43
political 1 443 43
operatives 1 443 43
or 1 443 43
hacks. 1 443 43

Take 1 443 44
for 1 443 44
example 1 443 44
Luke 1 443 44
Harding 1 443 44
of 1 443 44
the 1 443 44
Guardian 1 443 44
who 1 443 44
just 1 443 44
published 1 443 44
a 1 443 44
book 1 443 44
titled 1 443 44
Collusion: 1 443 44
Secret 1 443 44
Meetings, 1 443 44
Dirty 1 443 44
Money, 1 443 44
and 1 443 44
How 1 443 44
Russia 1 443 44
Helped 1 443 44
Donald 1 443 44
Trump 1 443 44
Win. 1 443 44

He 1 443 45
was 1 443 45
taken 1 443 45
apart 1 443 45
in 1 443 45
a 1 443 45
Real 1 443 45
News 1 443 45
interview 1 443 45
(vid) 1 443 45
about 1 443 45
the 1 443 45
book. 1 443 45

The 1 443 46
interviewer 1 443 46
pointed 1 443 46
out 1 443 46
that 1 443 46
there 1 443 46
is 1 443 46
absolutely 1 443 46
no 1 443 46
evidence 1 443 46
in 1 443 46
the 1 443 46
book 1 443 46
to 1 443 46
support 1 443 46
its 1 443 46
claims. 1 443 46

When 1 443 47
asked 1 443 47
for 1 443 47
any 1 443 47
proof 1 443 47
for 1 443 47
his 1 443 47
assertion 1 443 47
Harding 1 443 47
defensively 1 443 47
says 1 443 47
that 1 443 47
he 1 443 47
is 1 443 47
just 1 443 47
"storytelling" 1 443 47
- 1 443 47
in 1 443 47
other 1 443 47
words: 1 443 47
it 1 443 47
is 1 443 47
fiction. 1 443 47

Harding 1 443 48
earlier 1 443 48
wrote 1 443 48
a 1 443 48
book 1 443 48
about 1 443 48
Edward 1 443 48
Snowden 1 443 48
which 1 443 48
was 1 443 48
a 1 443 48
similar 1 443 48
sham. 1 443 48

Julian 1 443 49
Assange 1 443 49
called 1 443 49
it 1 443 49
"a 1 443 49
hack 1 443 49
job 1 443 49
in 1 443 49
the 1 443 49
purest 1 443 49
sense 1 443 49
of 1 443 49
the 1 443 49
term". 1 443 49

Harding 1 443 50
is 1 443 50
also 1 443 50
known 1 443 50
as 1 443 50
plagiarizer. 1 443 50

When 1 443 51
he 1 443 51
worked 1 443 51
in 1 443 51
Moscow 1 443 51
he 1 443 51
copied 1 443 51
stories 1 443 51
and 1 443 51
passages 1 443 51
from 1 443 51
the 1 443 51
now 1 443 51
defunct 1 443 51
Exile, 1 443 51
run 1 443 51
by 1 443 51
Matt 1 443 51
Taibbi 1 443 51
and 1 443 51
Mark 1 443 51
Ames. 1 443 51

The 1 443 52
Guardian 1 443 52
had 1 443 52
to 1 443 52
publish 1 443 52
an 1 443 52
apology. 1 443 52

The 1 443 53
new 1 443 53
Guardian 1 443 53
story 1 443 53
looked 1 443 53
like 1 443 53
another 1 443 53
weak 1 443 53
attempt 1 443 53
to 1 443 53
connect 1 443 53
the 1 443 53
alleged 1 443 53
Russian 1 443 53
malfeasance 1 443 53
with 1 443 53
Assange 1 443 53
and 1 443 53
the 1 443 53
Wikileaks 1 443 53
publishing 1 443 53
of 1 443 53
the 1 443 53
DNC 1 443 53
emails. 1 443 53

Assange 1 443 54
and 1 443 54
other 1 443 54
involved 1 443 54
people 1 443 54
deny 1 443 54
that 1 443 54
such 1 443 54
a 1 443 54
relation 1 443 54
existed. 1 443 54

There 1 443 55
is 1 443 55
no 1 443 55
public 1 443 55
evidence 1 443 55
that 1 443 55
support 1 443 55
such 1 443 55
claims. 1 443 55

Shortly 0 443 56
after 0 443 56
the 0 443 56
Guardian's 0 443 56
fake 0 443 56

Paul 0 443 56
Manafort 0 443 56
issued 0 443 56
an 0 443 56

Manafort 0 443 64

It 0 443 65
is 0 443 65

Manafort 0 443 65

the 0 443 66

The 1 443 87
story 1 443 87

completely 1 443 87
false 1 443 87
and 1 443 87
the 1 443 87
Guardian 1 443 87
knew 1 443 87
it 1 443 87
was. 1 443 87

It 1 443 88
disregarded 1 443 88

left 1 443 88
out 1 443 88

for 1 443 89
British 1 443 89

operations 1 443 89
aimed 1 443 89

defaming 1 443 89

It 1 443 90
smeared 1 443 90
Assange 1 443 90
and 1 443 90
Snowden 1 443 90
as 1 443 90
Russian 1 443 90
collaborators. 1 443 90

It 1 443 91
uncritically 1 443 91
peddled 1 443 91
the 1 443 91
Russiagate 1 443 91

and 1 443 91
the 1 443 91
nonsensical 1 443 91

which 1 443 91
are 1 443 91
both 1 443 91

concocted 1 443 91

on 1 443 94
its 1 443 94

the 1 443 94
fact 1 443 94
that 1 443 94
the 1 443 94
Guardian 1 443 94
published 1 443 94
this 1 443 94
piece, 1 443 94

that 1 443 94
Luke 1 443 94

the 1 443 94
tiniest 1 443 94
modicum 1 443 94
of 1 443 94
respect 1 443 94
as 1 443 94
a 1 443 94
journalist 1 443 94
despite 1 443 94
his 1 443 94
history 1 443 94
of 1 443 94
deceit, 1 443 94
tells 1 443 94
us 1 443 94
something 1 443 94
bone-chilling 1 443 94
about 1 443 94
journalism. 1 443 94

It 1 443 95
is 1 443 95
no 1 443 95
accident 1 443 95
that 1 443 95
Luke 1 443 95
Harding 1 443 95
is 1 443 95
still 1 443 95
employed: 1 443 95
in 1 443 95
fact, 1 443 95
it 1 443 95
is 1 443 95
because 1 443 95
of 1 443 95
Harding’s 1 443 95
consistent 1 443 95
loyalty 1 443 95
to 1 443 95
establishment, 1 443 95
specifically 1 443 95
the 1 443 95
UK 1 443 95
intelligence 1 443 95
apparatus, 1 443 95
over 1 443 95
the 1 443 95
truth 1 443 95
that 1 443 95
determines 1 443 95
his 1 443 95
“success” 1 443 95
amongst 1 443 95
legacy 1 443 95
press 1 443 95
outlets. 1 443 95

Harding 1 443 96
is 1 443 96
not 1 443 96
a 1 443 96
defacement 1 443 96
or 1 443 96
a 1 443 96
departure 1 443 96
from 1 443 96
the 1 443 96
norm, 1 443 96

it. 1 443 96

Jonathan 0 443 97

makes 0 443 97
a 0 443 97
similar 0 443 97
point: 0 443 97

The 0 443 98
truth 0 443 98
is 0 443 98
that 0 443 98
the 0 443 98
Guardian 0 443 98
has 0 443 98
not 0 443 98
erred 0 443 98
in 0 443 98
this 0 443 98
latest 0 443 98
story 0 443 98
attacking 0 443 98
Assange, 0 443 98
or 0 443 98
in 0 443 98
its 0 443 98
much 0 443 98
longer-running 0 443 98
campaign 0 443 98
to 1 443 98
vilify 1 443 98
him. 1 443 98

With 1 443 99
this 1 443 99
story, 1 443 99
it 1 443 99
has 1 443 99
done 1 443 99
what 1 443 99
it 1 443 99
regularly 1 443 99
does 1 443 99
when 1 443 99
supposedly 1 443 99
vital 1 443 99
western 1 443 99
foreign 1 443 99
policy 1 443 99
interests 1 443 99
are 1 443 99
at 1 443 99
stake 1 443 99
– 1 443 99
it 1 443 99
simply 1 443 99
regurgitates 1 443 99
an 1 443 99
elite-serving, 1 443 99
western 1 443 99
narrative. 1 443 99

Its 1 443 100

to 1 443 100
the 1 443 100
existing, 1 443 100
neoliberal 1 443 100
order: 1 443 100
... 1 443 100

The 1 443 101
Guardian 1 443 101
did 1 443 101
not 1 443 101
make 1 443 101
a 1 443 101
mistake 1 443 101
in 1 443 101
vilifying 1 443 101
Assange 1 443 101
without 1 443 101
a 1 443 101
shred 1 443 101
of 1 443 101
evidence. 1 443 101

It 1 443 102
did 1 443 102
what 1 443 102
it 1 443 102
is 1 443 102
designed 1 443 102
to 1 443 102
do. 1 443 102

We 1 443 103
have 1 443 103
previously 1 443 103
shown 1 443 103
that 1 443 103
the 1 443 103
Guardian 1 443 103
even 1 443 103
uses 1 443 103
fascist 1 443 103
propaganda 1 443 103
tropes 1 443 103
to 1 443 103
smear 1 443 103
the 1 443 103
Russian 1 443 103
people. 1 443 103

It 1 443 104
is 1 443 104
openly 1 443 104
publishing 1 443 104
Goebbels' 1 443 104
cartoons 1 443 104
and 1 443 104
rhetoric 1 443 104
against 1 443 104
Europes 1 443 104
biggest 1 443 104
state. 1 443 104

There 1 443 105
is 1 443 105
no 1 443 105
longer 1 443 105
any 1 443 105
line 1 443 105
that 1 443 105
it 1 443 105
does 1 443 105
not 1 443 105
dare 1 443 105
to 1 443 105
cross. 1 443 105

Unfortunately 1 443 106
other 1 443 106
'western' 1 443 106
media 1 443 106
are 1 443 106
not 1 443 106
much 1 443 106
better. 1 443 106

Within 0 443 107

published 0 443 107
the 0 443 107

That 0 443 108
did 0 443 108
not 0 443 108
hinder 0 443 108

its 0 443 108

Politico 1 443 109

Is 1 443 111
it 1 443 111
possible 1 443 111

was 0 125 1
brief: 0 125 1
on 0 125 1
the 0 125 1
Thursday 0 125 1

an 0 125 1
impromptu 0 125 1
question 0 125 1
tossed 1 125 1
out 1 125 1
by 0 125 1
a 0 125 1
Chilean 0 125 1
reporter, 0 125 1
the 0 125 1
pope 0 125 1
responded 0 125 1
in 0 125 1
what 0 125 1
one 0 125 1
reporter 0 125 1
described 0 125 1
as 0 125 1
a 0 125 1
“snippy 1 125 1
tone”: 1 125 1
“The 0 125 1
day 0 125 1
I 0 125 1
see 0 125 1
proof 0 125 1
against 0 125 1
Bishop 0 125 1

then 0 125 1
I 0 125 1
will 0 125 1
talk. 0 125 1

There 0 125 2
is 0 125 2
not 0 125 2
a 0 125 2
single 0 125 2
piece 0 125 2
of 0 125 2
evidence 0 125 2
against 0 125 2
him. 0 125 2

It 0 125 3
is 0 125 3
all 0 125 3
calumny. 0 125 3

Is 0 125 4
that 0 125 4
clear?” 0 125 4

This 0 125 5
month 0 125 5
has 0 125 5
been 0 125 5
quite 0 125 5
a 0 125 5
spectacle, 0 125 5
even 0 125 5
for 0 125 5
this 0 125 5
pontificate; 0 125 5
an 0 125 5
apparently 0 125 5
unending 1 125 5
stream 1 125 5
of 1 125 5
outrages 1 125 5
and 1 125 5
embarrassments, 1 125 5
with 0 125 5
the 0 125 5
pope 0 125 5
and 0 125 5
his 0 125 5
Vatican 0 125 5

one 0 125 5

to 0 125 5
the 0 125 5
next. 0 125 5

But 0 125 6
among 0 125 6
secular 0 125 6
reporters 0 125 6
the 0 125 6
sex 0 125 6
abuse 0 125 6
issue 0 125 6
trumps 0 125 6
all 0 125 6
others 0 125 6
and 0 125 6
the 0 125 6
fallout 0 125 6
continues 0 125 6
to 1 125 6
blaze 1 125 6
down 1 125 6
on 0 125 6
the 0 125 6
Bergoglian 0 125 6
pontificate 0 125 6
in 0 125 6
response 0 125 6
to 0 125 6
his 0 125 6
amazing 0 125 6
accusation 0 125 6
earlier 0 125 6
this 0 125 6
month 0 125 6
that 0 125 6
victims 0 125 6
of 0 125 6

It 0 125 7
seems 0 125 7
the 0 125 7
shine 0 125 7
is 0 125 7
coming 0 125 7
off 0 125 7
the 0 125 7

it 0 125 9
gets 0 125 9
worse 0 125 9
than 0 125 9

“These 0 125 14

at 0 125 14
the 0 125 14
least 0 125 14
shameful. 0 125 14

At 0 125 15
the 0 125 15
most, 0 125 15
they 0 125 15
suggest 0 125 15
that 0 125 15

The 0 125 16

all 0 125 16
too 0 125 16
familiar: 0 125 16

“The 0 125 17

exactly 0 125 18
he 0 125 18

the 0 125 19
flight 0 125 19

a 0 125 19
Chilean 0 125 19

As 0 125 20
she 0 125 20
spoke 0 125 20
to 0 125 20
the 0 125 20
pope, 0 125 20
her 1 125 20
voice 1 125 20
cracked 1 125 20
with 1 125 20
nervousness 1 125 20
at 0 125 20
questioning 0 125 20
the 0 125 20
church’s 0 125 20
top 0 125 20
leader. 0 125 20

She 0 125 21
asked: 0 125 21
‘Why 0 125 21
are 0 125 21
not 0 125 21
the 0 125 21
victims’ 0 125 21

Why 0 125 22
do 0 125 22
you 0 125 22
not 0 125 22
believe 0 125 22
them?’ 0 125 22
The 0 125 22
pope 0 125 22
gave 0 125 22
no 0 125 22
satisfying 0 125 22
answer, 0 125 22
only 0 125 22
repeating 0 125 22
a 0 125 22

‘no 0 125 22
evidence’ 0 125 22
against 0 125 22
the 0 125 22
bishop.” 0 125 22

Indeed, 0 125 23
it 0 125 23
was 0 125 23
understood, 0 125 23
as 0 125 23
the 0 125 23

part 0 125 23

as 0 125 23
“an 0 125 23
apology 0 125 23
tour” 0 125 23
to 0 125 23
abuse 0 125 23
survivors. 0 125 23

Which 0 125 24
is 0 125 24
why 0 125 24
his 0 125 24
accusation 0 125 24
of 0 125 24
calumny 0 125 24

those 0 125 24
same 0 125 24
victims 0 125 24

came 0 125 24
as 0 125 24
such 0 125 24
a 0 125 24
shock 0 125 24
to 0 125 24
observers 0 125 24
unused 0 125 24

ability 0 125 24
to 0 125 24
turn 0 125 24
on 0 125 24
a 0 125 24
dime. 0 125 24

of 0 125 26
sexual 0 125 26
abuse 0 125 26
by 0 125 26
priests. 0 125 26

He 0 125 27
made 0 125 27
all 0 125 27
the 0 125 27
right 0 125 27
noises, 0 125 27
talking 0 125 27
about 0 125 27
his 0 125 27
“pain 0 125 27

shame,” 0 125 27
and 0 125 27
reportedly 0 125 27

what 0 125 27
happened. 0 125 27

“I 0 125 28

“What 0 125 31
the 0 125 31
Pope 0 125 31

done 0 125 31
today 0 125 31

offensive 0 125 31

and 0 125 31
not 0 125 31
only 0 125 31

“Does 0 125 31

Sorry 0 125 32
Austen, 0 125 32
we 0 125 32
didn’t 0 125 32
think 0 125 32
of 0 125 32
it 0 125 32
as 0 125 32
we 0 125 32

of 0 125 33

the 0 125 33
outcry 0 125 33
has 0 125 33

forces. 0 125 34

Barros 0 125 35
claimed 0 125 35
in 0 125 35
court 0 125 35
that 0 125 35
the 0 125 35
first 0 125 35

This 0 125 36
is 0 125 36
refuted 0 125 36
by 0 125 36
Karadima’s 0 125 36
victims 0 125 36
– 0 125 36

Last 0 125 37
Thursday, 0 125 37
however, 0 125 37
was 0 125 37
not 0 125 37
the 0 125 37
first 0 125 37
time 0 125 37
Francis, 0 125 37
confronted 0 125 37
unexpectedly 0 125 37
in 0 125 37
public 0 125 37
over 0 125 37
the 0 125 37
Barros 0 125 37
question, 0 125 37
has 0 125 37
responded 0 125 37
testily 0 125 37
and 0 125 37
with 0 125 37
insults. 0 125 37

In 0 125 38
2015 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
Italian 0 125 38
newspaper 0 125 38

published 0 125 38
a 0 125 38
video 0 125 38
of 0 125 38
him 0 125 38
scolding 0 125 38
two 0 125 38
women 0 125 38
who 0 125 38
spoke 0 125 38
with 0 125 38
him 0 125 38
in 0 125 38
St. 0 125 38
Peter’s 0 125 38
Piazza, 0 125 38
asking 0 125 38
that 0 125 38
he 0 125 38
reconsider 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
appointment, 0 125 38
citing 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
“suffering” 0 125 38
of 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
Church 0 125 38
in 0 125 38
Chile 0 125 38
over 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
issue. 0 125 38

The 0 125 39
pope 0 125 39
told 0 125 39
the 0 125 39
women, 0 125 39
“The 0 125 39
Church 0 125 39
has 0 125 39
lost 0 125 39
its 0 125 39
freedom, 0 125 39
letting 0 125 39
its 0 125 39
head 0 125 39
fill 0 125 39
with 0 125 39
politicians 0 125 39
and 0 125 39
accusing 0 125 39
a 0 125 39
bishop 0 125 39
without 0 125 39
having 0 125 39
any 0 125 39
proof, 0 125 39
after 0 125 39
twenty 0 125 39
years 0 125 39
of 0 125 39
service, 0 125 39
so 0 125 39
think 1 125 39
with 1 125 39
your 1 125 39
head.” 1 125 39
He 0 125 39
warned 0 125 39
them 0 125 39
not 0 125 39
to 0 125 39
allow 0 125 39
themselves 0 125 39
to 0 125 39
be 0 125 39
led 0 125 39
by 0 125 39
“leftists 1 125 39
who 1 125 39
have 1 125 39
set 1 125 39
up 1 125 39
this 1 125 39
thing.” 1 125 39

“The 0 125 40
only 0 125 40
charge 0 125 40
against 0 125 40
this 0 125 40
bishop 0 125 40
has 0 125 40
been 0 125 40
discredited 0 125 40
by 0 125 40
the 0 125 40
Court 0 125 40
of 0 125 40
Justice, 0 125 40
so 0 125 40
please 0 125 40
do 0 125 40
not 0 125 40
lose 0 125 40
your 0 125 40
serenity, 0 125 40
you 0 125 40
suffer, 0 125 40
but 0 125 40
because 0 125 40
you 1 125 40
are 1 125 40
foolish...I 1 125 40
am 0 125 40
the 0 125 40
first 0 125 40
to 0 125 40
judge 0 125 40
and 0 125 40
punish 0 125 40
those 0 125 40
accused 0 125 40
of 0 125 40
similar 0 125 40
crimes, 0 125 40
but 0 125 40
in 0 125 40
this 0 125 40
case 0 125 40
there 0 125 40
is 0 125 40
not 0 125 40
even 0 125 40
a 0 125 40
proof.” 0 125 40

The 0 125 41
insults 0 125 41
were 0 125 41
not 0 125 41
forgotten. 0 125 41

Among 0 125 42
the 0 125 42
signs 0 125 42
held 0 125 42
by 0 125 42
protesters 0 125 42
in 0 125 42
Chile 0 125 42
last 0 125 42
week 0 125 42
were 0 125 42
those 0 125 42
reading, 0 125 42
“Ni 0 125 42
zurdos, 0 125 42
ni 0 125 42
tontos,” 0 125 42
(Neither 1 125 42
lefties 1 125 42
nor 1 125 42
stupid). 1 125 42

The 0 125 43
jab 0 125 43
certainly 0 125 43
wasn’t 0 125 43
lost 0 125 43
on 0 125 43
Francis, 0 125 43
since 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
signs 0 125 43
were 0 125 43
being 0 125 43
held 0 125 43
by 0 125 43
protesters 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
full 0 125 43
length 0 125 43
of 0 125 43
his 0 125 43
auto 0 125 43
route 0 125 43
to 0 125 43
Santiago 0 125 43
from 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
airport. 0 125 43

One 0 125 44
of 0 125 44
the 0 125 44
protesters 0 125 44
told 0 125 44
the 0 125 44
BBC, 0 125 44
“He 0 125 44
doesn’t 0 125 44
even 0 125 44
know 0 125 44
us, 0 125 44
so 0 125 44
how 0 125 44
can 0 125 44
he 0 125 44
accuse 0 125 44
us 0 125 44
of 0 125 44
being 0 125 44
such 0 125 44
things? 0 125 44

He 0 125 45
thinks 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
politically 0 125 45
motivated 0 125 45
even 0 125 45
though 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
come 0 125 45
from 0 125 45
different 0 125 45
parishes 0 125 45
in 0 125 45
Osorno 0 125 45
and 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
doing 0 125 45
this 0 125 45
because 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
against 0 125 45
priests 0 125 45
being 0 125 45
allowed 0 125 45
to 0 125 45
abuse 0 125 45
children.” 0 125 45

Apparently 0 125 46
His 0 125 46
Holiness 0 125 46
was 0 125 46
informed 0 125 46
that 0 125 46
the 0 125 46
“calumny” 1 125 46
comment 1 125 46
had 0 125 46
caused 0 125 46
some 0 125 46
blow-back 0 125 46
because 0 125 46
a 0 125 46
couple 0 125 46
of 0 125 46
days 0 125 46
later 0 125 46
we 0 125 46
got 0 125 46
something 0 125 46
touted 0 125 46
– 0 125 46
though 0 125 46
somewhat 0 125 46
skeptically 0 125 46
– 0 125 46
as 0 125 46
a 0 125 46
“contrite” 0 125 46
papal 0 125 46
apology. 0 125 46

This 0 125 47
also 0 125 47
followed 0 125 47
an 0 125 47
astonishing 0 125 47
public 0 125 47
rebuke 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
the 0 125 47
pope 0 125 47
by 0 125 47
Sean 0 125 47

the 0 125 47
pope’s 0 125 47
sex 0 125 47
abuse 0 125 47
commission 0 125 47
– 0 125 47
who 0 125 47
said, 0 125 47
“It 0 125 47
is 0 125 47
understandable 0 125 47
that 0 125 47
Pope 0 125 47
Francis’ 0 125 47
statements 0 125 47
yesterday 0 125 47
in 0 125 47
Santiago, 0 125 47
Chile 0 125 47
were 0 125 47
a 0 125 47
source 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
great 0 125 47
pain 0 125 47
for 0 125 47

“Pope 0 125 48
Francis 0 125 48
fully 0 125 48
recognizes 0 125 48
the 1 125 48
egregious 1 125 48
failures 1 125 48
of 0 125 48
the 0 125 48
Church 0 125 48
and 0 125 48
its 0 125 48
clergy 0 125 48
who 0 125 48
abused 0 125 48
children 0 125 48

the 0 125 48
devastating 1 125 48
impact 1 125 48
those 0 125 48
crimes 0 125 48

O’Malley 0 125 48
said. 0 125 48

Of 0 125 49
course, 0 125 49
Francis 0 125 49
being 0 125 49
Francis 0 125 49
the 0 125 49
apology 0 125 49
was 0 125 49
banked 0 125 49
around 0 125 49
with 0 125 49
assertions 0 125 49
of 0 125 49
how 0 125 49
right 0 125 49
he 0 125 49
was. 0 125 49

“I 0 125 50
have 0 125 50
to 0 125 50
ask 0 125 50
forgiveness 0 125 50
because 0 125 50
the 0 125 50
word 0 125 50
‘proof’ 0 125 50
wounded,” 0 125 50
he 0 125 50
said. 0 125 50

“It 0 125 51
wounded 0 125 51
many 0 125 51

were 0 125 51
abused…I 0 125 51
ask 0 125 51
them 0 125 51
for 0 125 51
forgiveness 0 125 51

I 0 125 51
wounded 0 125 51
them 0 125 51
without 0 125 51
realizing 0 125 51
it, 0 125 51

it 0 125 51
was 0 125 51
an 0 125 51
unintended 0 125 51
wound. 0 125 51

And 0 125 52
this 1 125 52
horrified 1 125 52
me 1 125 52
a 1 125 52
lot, 1 125 52

“And 0 125 53
I 0 125 53
know 0 125 53
how 0 125 53
much 0 125 53
they 0 125 53
suffer, 0 125 53
to 0 125 53
feel 0 125 53
that 0 125 53
the 0 125 53
Pope 0 125 53
says 0 125 53
in 0 125 53
their 0 125 53
face 0 125 53
‘bring 0 125 53
me 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
letter, 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
proof.’ 0 125 53
It’s 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
slap. 0 125 53

And 0 125 54
I 0 125 54
agree 0 125 54
that 0 125 54
my 0 125 54
expression 0 125 54
was 0 125 54
not 0 125 54
apt, 0 125 54
because 0 125 54
I 0 125 54
didn’t 0 125 54
think.” 0 125 54

He 0 125 55
doubled 0 125 55
down, 0 125 55
saying, 0 125 55
“I 0 125 55
have 0 125 55
not 0 125 55
heard 0 125 55
any 0 125 55

They 0 125 56
did 0 125 56
not 0 125 56
come, 0 125 56
they 0 125 56
did 0 125 56
not 0 125 56
show 0 125 56
themselves, 0 125 56
they 0 125 56
did 0 125 56
not 0 125 56
give 0 125 56
evidence 0 125 56

It’s 1 125 57
all 1 125 57
in 1 125 57
the 1 125 57
air. 1 125 57

It 0 125 58
is 0 125 58
true 0 125 58
that 0 125 58
Barros 0 125 58
was 0 125 58
in 0 125 58
Karadima’s 0 125 58
group 0 125 58
of 0 125 58
young 0 125 58
people. 0 125 58

But 0 125 59
let 0 125 59
us 0 125 59
be 0 125 59
clear: 0 125 59
if 0 125 59
you 0 125 59
accuse 0 125 59
someone 0 125 59
without 0 125 59
evidence 0 125 59
with 0 125 59
pertinacity, 0 125 59
that 0 125 59
is 0 125 59
calumny.” 0 125 59

“This 0 125 60
is 0 125 60
what 0 125 60
I 0 125 60
can 0 125 60
say 0 125 60
with 0 125 60
sincerity. 0 125 60

Barros 0 125 61
will 0 125 61
remain 0 125 61
there 0 125 61
if 0 125 61
I 0 125 61
don’t 0 125 61

Is 0 125 64
that 0 125 64
clear?” 0 125 64

This 0 125 65
“contrite” 0 125 65
papal 0 125 65
apology 0 125 65

the 0 125 66

it 0 125 66
as 0 125 66
“an 0 125 66
extremely 0 125 66
rare 0 125 66

of 0 125 66
self-criticism,” 0 125 66
for 0 125 66
the 0 125 66
“unusually 1 125 66
contrite” 1 125 66
Bergoglio, 0 125 66
and 0 125 66
noted 0 125 66
that, 0 125 66
“While 0 125 66
the 0 125 66

for 0 125 66

abuse, 0 125 66
his 0 125 66

sputtered.” 0 125 66

Indeed, 0 125 67

the 0 125 69

were 0 125 69
told 0 125 69

that 0 125 69
his 0 125 69

already 0 125 69
final, 0 125 69
some 0 125 69
six 0 125 69
months 0 125 69
before 0 125 69
the 0 125 69
trip.” 0 125 69

Who 0 125 70
is 0 125 70
Barros? 0 125 70

Some 0 125 71
may 0 125 71
remember 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
video 0 125 71
that 0 125 71
made 0 125 71
the 0 125 71
internet 0 125 71
rounds 0 125 71
of 0 125 71
an 0 125 71
uproar 0 125 71
in 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
Chilean 0 125 71
cathedral 0 125 71
at 0 125 71
the 0 125 71
installation 0 125 71
ceremony 0 125 71
of 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
bishop. 0 125 71

At 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
time 0 125 72
it 0 125 72
didn’t 0 125 72
draw 0 125 72
much 0 125 72
attention 0 125 72
from 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
English 0 125 72
language 0 125 72
press 0 125 72
– 0 125 72
mostly 0 125 72
at 0 125 72
that 0 125 72
time 0 125 72
distracted 0 125 72
by 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
ongoing 0 125 72
battle 0 125 72
of 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
notorious 0 125 72

Proposal 0 125 72
and 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
oncoming 0 125 72
Synods. 0 125 72

But 0 125 73
despite 0 125 73
the 0 125 73
pope’s 0 125 73
claim, 0 125 73
the 0 125 73
charges 0 125 73
against 0 125 73
Barros 0 125 73
are 0 125 73
serious 0 125 73
and 0 125 73
have 0 125 73
been 0 125 73
deemed 0 125 73
credible 0 125 73
by 0 125 73
a 0 125 73
judge. 0 125 73

He 0 125 74
is 0 125 74
accused 0 125 74
of 0 125 74
having 0 125 74
covered 0 125 74
up 0 125 74
sexual 0 125 74
abuse, 0 125 74
including 0 125 74
destroying 0 125 74
evidence, 0 125 74
committed 0 125 74
by 0 125 74
Karadima 0 125 74
in 0 125 74
the 0 125 74
‘80s 0 125 74
and 0 125 74
‘90s. 0 125 74

In 0 125 75
fact 0 125 75
– 0 125 75
and 0 125 75
this 0 125 75
point 0 125 75
has 0 125 75
tended 0 125 75
to 0 125 75
get 0 125 75
glossed 0 125 75
over 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
press 0 125 75
– 0 125 75
Barros 0 125 75
is 0 125 75
accused 0 125 75
by 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
victims 0 125 75
of 0 125 75
having 0 125 75
been 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
room, 0 125 75
watching 0 125 75
at 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
time, 0 125 75
and 0 125 75
of 0 125 75
engaging 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
sexual 0 125 75
activity 0 125 75
with 0 125 75
Karadima. 0 125 75

This 0 125 76
is 0 125 76
not, 0 125 76
therefore, 0 125 76
merely 0 125 76
a 0 125 76
matter 0 125 76
of 0 125 76
a 0 125 76
bishop 0 125 76
or 0 125 76
colleague 0 125 76
discovering 0 125 76
the 0 125 76
abuse 0 125 76
after 0 125 76
the 0 125 76
fact, 0 125 76
but 0 125 76
of 0 125 76
being 0 125 76
a 1 125 76
voyeuristic 1 125 76
participant. 1 125 76

that 0 125 80

The 0 125 108
pope 0 125 108

this 0 125 108

that 0 125 112
you 0 125 112
have 0 125 112
about 0 125 112

Monsignor 0 125 112

I 0 125 113
understand 0 125 113
what 0 125 113
you’re 0 125 113
telling 0 125 113
me 0 125 113
and 0 125 113
I’m 0 125 113
aware 0 125 113
that 0 125 113
the 0 125 113
situation 0 125 113
of 0 125 113
the 0 125 113
church 0 125 113
in 0 125 113
Chile 0 125 113
is 0 125 113
difficult 0 125 113
due 0 125 113
to 0 125 113
the 0 125 113
trials 0 125 113
you’ve 0 125 113
had 0 125 113
to 0 125 113
undergo.” 0 125 113
The 0 125 113
letter 0 125 113
said 0 125 113
that 0 125 113
in 0 125 113
2014 0 125 113
the 0 125 113
nuncio, 0 125 113
Archbishop 0 125 113
Scapolo, 0 125 113
had 0 125 113
asked 0 125 113
Barros 0 125 113
to 0 125 113
resign 0 125 113
as 0 125 113
bishop 0 125 113
of 0 125 113
the 0 125 113
armed 0 125 113
forces 0 125 113
and 0 125 113
had 0 125 113
“encouraged 0 125 113
him 0 125 113

also 0 125 114

doubt 0 125 114
the 0 125 114

was 0 125 114
fully 0 125 114

the 0 125 118
earliest 0 125 118

that 0 125 118

often 0 125 119

was 0 125 119
followed 0 125 119
with 0 125 119

from 0 125 119
Francis 0 125 119
about 0 125 119
there 0 125 119

the 0 125 120
pattern 0 125 120
which 0 125 120
was 0 125 120
well 0 125 120

even 0 125 121
before 0 125 121

as 0 125 123

a 0 125 124
cloud 0 125 124
of 0 125 124
scandal 0 125 124
when 0 125 124
he 0 125 124
was 0 125 124
accused 0 125 124
of 0 125 124
having 0 125 124

determined 0 125 125
undeniably 0 125 125
that 0 125 125
Danneels 0 125 125
had 0 125 125
told 0 125 125

The 0 125 126
cardinal 0 125 126
even 0 125 126
went 0 125 126
so 0 125 126
far 0 125 126
as 0 125 126
to 0 125 126
suggest 0 125 126
that 0 125 126
the 0 125 126

Danneels 0 125 127
had 0 125 127
also 0 125 127

In 0 125 128
the 0 125 128
book, 0 125 128
Colonna 0 125 128
asks 0 125 128
the 0 125 128
question, 0 125 128
“What 1 125 128

“This 0 125 132
Pope 0 125 132

they 0 125 133
said 0 125 133
no, 0 125 133

simply 0 125 133
removed 0 125 133
them.” 0 125 133

Despite 0 125 135
his 0 125 135
claims 0 125 135
that 0 125 135
he 0 125 135
punishes 0 125 135
the 0 125 135

the 0 125 135
now-equally 0 125 135
notorious 0 125 135
Cardinal 0 125 135
Coccopalmerio. 0 125 135

Inzoli 0 125 136
was 0 125 136
found 0 125 136
guilty 0 125 136
in 0 125 136
2012 0 125 136
by 0 125 136
an 0 125 136
ecclesiastical 0 125 136
court 0 125 136
of 0 125 136
abusing 0 125 136

as 0 125 136
twelve 0 125 136

suspended. 0 125 136

Inzoli 0 125 137
had 0 125 137
even 0 125 137
abused 0 125 137
boys 0 125 137
in 0 125 137
the 0 125 137
confessional, 0 125 137
convincing 0 125 137
them 0 125 137
that 0 125 137
the 1 125 137
abuse 1 125 137
was 1 125 137
approved 1 125 137
by 1 125 137
God. 1 125 137

Following 0 125 138
an 0 125 138
appeal 0 125 138
by 0 125 138
Coccopalmerio, 0 125 138
Francis 0 125 138
reduced 0 125 138
the 0 125 138
priest’s 0 125 138
penalty 0 125 138
to 0 125 138

away 0 125 138

The 0 125 139
uproar 0 125 139
over 0 125 139
this 0 125 139
caused 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
Italian 0 125 139
prosecutors 0 125 139
to 0 125 139
reopen 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
case 0 125 139
against 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
priest, 0 125 139
and 0 125 139
eventually 0 125 139
Inzoli 0 125 139
went 0 125 139
to 0 125 139
prison 0 125 139
and 0 125 139
was 0 125 139
laicized. 0 125 139

As 0 125 140
for 0 125 140
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0 125 140
procedural 0 125 140

rumours 0 125 140
continue 0 125 140
to 0 125 140
circulate 0 125 140
that 0 125 140
the 0 125 140

intends 0 125 140
to 0 125 140
reverse 0 125 140
them 0 125 140
as 0 125 140
well, 0 125 140
placing 0 125 140
competence 0 125 140
back 0 125 140
into 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
hands 0 125 140
of 0 125 140

denied 0 125 141
by 0 125 141

Burke, 0 125 141
but 0 125 141
given 1 125 141

usual 1 125 141

it’s 1 125 141
anyone’s 1 125 141

who 1 125 141
in 1 125 141

is 1 125 141
actually 1 125 141

… 0 127 18
During 0 127 18

to 0 127 21

that’s 0 127 21
there 0 127 21
is 0 127 21
more 0 127 21

During 0 127 22
the 0 127 22
2008 0 127 22
presidential 0 127 22
election, 0 127 22
conservatives 0 127 22
questioned 0 127 22
the 0 127 22
indirect 0 127 22
ties 0 127 22
between 0 127 22
Farrakhan 0 127 22
and 0 127 22
Obama, 0 127 22
who 0 127 22
attended 0 127 22
a 0 127 22
church 0 127 22
that 0 127 22
gave 0 127 22
Farrakhan 0 127 22
an 0 127 22
award. 0 127 22

Rev. 0 127 23

Jeremiah 0 127 24

but 0 127 24
the 0 127 24
story 0 127 24
didn’t 0 127 24
make 0 127 24
the 0 127 24
press 0 127 24
until 0 127 24
the 0 127 24
following 0 127 24
year. 0 127 24

Similarly, 0 127 25
very 0 127 25
little 0 127 25
media 0 127 25
attention 0 127 25
was 0 127 25
paid 0 127 25
to 0 127 25
the 0 127 25
close 0 127 25
relationship 0 127 25

Obama’s 0 127 25
fundraiser 0 127 25
and 0 127 25
private 0 127 25
mentor 0 127 25
Tony 0 127 25
Rezko 0 127 25
and 0 127 25
the 0 127 25
Nation 0 127 25
of 0 127 25
Islam, 0 127 25
even 0 127 25
though 0 127 25
Rezko’s 0 127 25
role 0 127 25
was 0 127 25
business 0 127 25
manager 0 127 25
for 0 127 25
Nation 0 127 25
of 0 127 25
Islam 0 127 25
assets, 0 127 25
such 0 127 25
as 0 127 25
the 0 127 25
career 0 127 25
of 0 127 25

But 0 127 26
after 0 127 26
all, 0 127 26
what 0 127 26
could 0 127 26
be 0 127 26
more 0 127 26
boring 0 127 26
than 0 127 26
a 0 127 26

unprofessional.” 0 132 28

Iranian 0 132 29
arrogance 0 132 29
and 0 132 29
impudence 0 132 29
reached 0 132 29
its 0 132 29
zenith 0 132 29
with 0 132 29
the 0 132 29
January 0 132 29
12th 0 132 29
2016 0 132 29
seizure 0 132 29

American 0 132 29

command 0 132 29

and 0 132 29
their 0 132 29
crews 0 132 29
near 0 132 29
Farsi 0 132 29
Island. 0 132 29

The 0 132 30
RCBs 0 132 30
and 0 132 30
crews 0 132 30
manning 0 132 30
them 0 132 30
were 0 132 30
returned 0 132 30
some 0 132 30
16 0 132 30
hours 0 132 30
later 0 132 30
but 0 132 30
not 0 132 30
before 0 132 30
the 0 132 30
Iranians 0 132 30
stole 0 132 30
two 0 132 30
satellite 0 132 30
phone 0 132 30
sim 0 132 30
cards, 0 132 30
likely 0 132 30
containing 0 132 30
classified 0 132 30
information, 0 132 30
as 0 132 30
well 0 132 30
as 0 132 30
thousands 0 132 30
of 0 132 30
pages 0 132 30
of 0 132 30
information 0 132 30
downloaded 0 132 30
from 0 132 30
laptops, 0 132 30
GPS 0 132 30
devices 0 132 30
and 0 132 30
maps 0 132 30
used 0 132 30
by 0 132 30
the 0 132 30
sailors. 0 132 30

Ironically, 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
seizure 0 132 31
occurred 0 132 31
on 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
very 0 132 31
day 0 132 31
that 0 132 31
Obama 0 132 31
was 0 132 31
to 0 132 31
give 0 132 31
his 0 132 31
State 0 132 31
of 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
Union 0 132 31
address 0 132 31
but 0 132 31
predictably, 0 132 31
he 1 132 31
didn’t 1 132 31
think 1 132 31
that 1 132 31
the 1 132 31
seizure 1 132 31
of 1 132 31
Americans 1 132 31
was 1 132 31
important 1 132 31
enough 1 132 31
to 1 132 31
note. 1 132 31

But 0 132 32
according 0 132 32
to 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
Navy, 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
past 0 132 32
five 0 132 32
months 0 132 32
have 0 132 32
witnessed 0 132 32
markedly 0 132 32
less 0 132 32
belligerent 0 132 32
conduct 0 132 32
from 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
Iranians, 0 132 32
leaving 0 132 32
Navy 0 132 32
officials 0 132 32
baffled 0 132 32
by 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
sudden 0 132 32
positive 0 132 32
change 0 132 32
in 0 132 32
attitude. 0 132 32

In 0 132 33
fact, 0 132 33
Iran’s 0 132 33
attitude 0 132 33
adjustment 0 132 33
in 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Arabian 0 132 33
Gulf 0 132 33
is 0 132 33
no 0 132 33
mystery 0 132 33
and 0 132 33
stems 0 132 33
from 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Trump 0 132 33
administration’s 0 132 33
implementation 0 132 33
of 0 132 33
a 0 132 33
new 0 132 33
robust 0 132 33
foreign 0 132 33
policy 0 132 33
vis-à-vis 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Islamic 0 132 33
Republic. 0 132 33

Soon 0 132 34
after 0 132 34
taking 0 132 34
office, 0 132 34
Trump 0 132 34
noted 0 132 34
that 0 132 34
“Iran 0 132 34
[was] 0 132 34
playing 0 132 34
with 0 132 34
fire” 0 132 34
and 0 132 34
added 0 132 34
that 0 132 34
he 0 132 34
wouldn’t 0 132 34
be 0 132 34
as 0 132 34
“kind” 0 132 34
to 0 132 34
the 0 132 34
mullahs 0 132 34
as 0 132 34
Obama 0 132 34
was. 0 132 34

This 0 132 35
wasn’t 0 132 35
empty 1 132 35
rhetoric. 1 132 35

It 0 132 36
was 0 132 36
backed 0 132 36
up 0 132 36
by 0 132 36
tangible 0 132 36
action. 0 132 36

Additional 0 132 37
sanctions 0 132 37
were 0 132 37
imposed 0 132 37
against 0 132 37
Iran 0 132 37
for 0 132 37
acting 0 132 37
in 0 132 37
defiance 0 132 37
of 0 132 37
UNSCR 0 132 37
2231. 0 132 37

Sanctions 0 132 38
were 0 132 38
also 0 132 38
imposed 0 132 38
against 0 132 38
the 0 132 38
IRGC 0 132 38
for 0 132 38
supporting 0 132 38
terrorism. 0 132 38

Trump’s 0 132 39
DOJ 0 132 39
revived 0 132 39
and 0 132 39
breathed 0 132 39
new 0 132 39
life 0 132 39
into 0 132 39
Project 0 132 39
Cassandra, 0 132 39
a 0 132 39
promising 0 132 39
anti-Hezbollah/IRGC 0 132 39
law 0 132 39
enforcement 0 132 39
initiative 0 132 39
shelved 0 132 39
by 0 132 39
Obama. 0 132 39

Most 0 132 40
importantly, 0 132 40
Trump 0 132 40
failed 0 132 40
to 0 132 40
certify 0 132 40
the 0 132 40
JCPOA 0 132 40
noting 0 132 40
material 0 132 40
Iranian 0 132 40
breaches, 0 132 40
and 0 132 40
has 0 132 40
threatened 0 132 40
to 0 132 40
abrogate 0 132 40
the 0 132 40
deal 0 132 40
in 0 132 40
its 0 132 40
entirety 0 132 40
unless 0 132 40
modifications 0 132 40
are 0 132 40
implemented. 0 132 40

Those 0 132 41
modifications 0 132 41
would 0 132 41
include 0 132 41
an 0 132 41
end 0 132 41
to 0 132 41
absurd 0 132 41
sunset 0 132 41
clauses 0 132 41
in 0 132 41
the 0 132 41
JCPOA 0 132 41
and 0 132 41
tough 0 132 41
restrictions 0 132 41
on 0 132 41
ballistic 0 132 41
missile 0 132 41
testing. 0 132 41

The 0 132 41

mullahs 0 132 41

have 0 132 41

become 0 132 41

cognizant 0 132 41

of 0 132 41

the 0 132 41

fact 0 132 41

that 0 132 41

there’s 0 132 41

a 1 132 41

new 1 132 41

sheriff 1 132 41

in 1 132 41

town, 1 132 41

one 0 132 41

that 0 132 41

backs 0 132 41

up 0 132 41

tough 0 132 41

talk 0 132 41

with 0 132 41

action 0 132 41

and 0 132 41

doesn’t 1 132 41

ask 1 132 41

“how 1 132 41

high” 1 132 41

when 1 132 41

they 1 132 41

say 1 132 41

“jump.” 1 132 41

Clearly, 1 132 41

the 0 132 41

IRGC’s 0 132 41

new 0 132 41

docile 1 132 41

in 0 132 41

Douthat 0 137 6
laid 0 137 6
out 0 137 6

Faggioli, 0 137 9
meanwhile, 0 137 9
outlined 0 137 9
a 1 137 9
genuinely 1 137 9
surprising 1 137 9
position. 1 137 9

Rather 0 137 10
than 0 137 10
making 0 137 10
a 0 137 10
straightforward 0 137 10
case 0 137 10
for 0 137 10
why 0 137 10
Pope 0 137 10
Francis 0 137 10
has 0 137 10
changed 0 137 10
the 0 137 10
Church 0 137 10
for 0 137 10
the 0 137 10
better, 0 137 10
Faggioli 0 137 10
rejected 0 137 10
the 0 137 10
possibility 0 137 10
of 0 137 10
evaluating 0 137 10
his 0 137 10
papacy 0 137 10
in 0 137 10
terms 0 137 10
of 0 137 10
“continuity” 0 137 10
with 0 137 10
past 0 137 10
popes, 0 137 10
since 0 137 10
doing 0 137 10
so 0 137 10
would 0 137 10
assume 0 137 10
that 0 137 10
“Christianity 0 137 10
at 0 137 10
some 0 137 10
point 0 137 10
. 0 137 10

. 0 137 11

. 0 137 12

was 0 137 13
complete,” 0 137 13
which 0 137 13
Faggioli 0 137 13
does 0 137 13
not 0 137 13
think 0 137 13
is 0 137 13
true. 0 137 13

While 0 137 14
I 0 137 14
emphatically 0 137 14
disagree 0 137 14
with 0 137 14
this 0 137 14
argument, 0 137 14
I 0 137 14
have 0 137 14
to 0 137 14
hand 0 137 14
it 0 137 14
to 0 137 14
Faggioli: 0 137 14
From 0 137 14
the 0 137 14
outset, 0 137 14
he 0 137 14
made 0 137 14
clear 0 137 14
that 0 137 14
he 0 137 14
was 0 137 14
not 0 137 14
planning 0 137 14
to 0 137 14
debate 0 137 14
Douthat 0 137 14
on 0 137 14
the 0 137 14
implications 0 137 14
of 0 137 14
the 0 137 14
Francis 0 137 14
papacy. 0 137 14

Instead, 0 137 15
through 0 137 15
a 1 137 15
combination 1 137 15
of 1 137 15
rhetorical 1 137 15
tricks 1 137 15
and 1 137 15
soft-peddled 1 137 15
Hegelianism, 1 137 15
he 0 137 15
would 0 137 15
completely 0 137 15
redefine 0 137 15
the 0 137 15
role 0 137 15
and 0 137 15
nature 0 137 15
of 0 137 15
the 0 137 15
Catholic 0 137 15
Church. 0 137 15

During 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
crux 0 137 16
of 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
debate 0 137 16
— 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
discussion 0 137 16
of 0 137 16
communion 0 137 16
for 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
divorced 0 137 16
and 0 137 16
remarried 0 137 16
— 0 137 16
Faggioli 0 137 16
raised 0 137 16
his 1 137 16
most 1 137 16
theologically 1 137 16
unsettling 1 137 16
point. 1 137 16

To 0 137 17
defend 0 137 17
his 0 137 17
position 0 137 17
that 0 137 17
remarried 0 137 17
persons 0 137 17
should 0 137 17
be 0 137 17
able 0 137 17
to 0 137 17
receive 0 137 17
communion, 0 137 17
Faggioli 0 137 17
invoked 0 137 17
the 0 137 17
case 0 137 17
of 0 137 17
Germany, 0 137 17
where 0 137 17
50 0 137 17
percent 0 137 17
of 0 137 17
Catholic 0 137 17
marriages 0 137 17
end 0 137 17
in 0 137 17
divorce. 0 137 17

For 1 137 18
Faggioli, 1 137 18
the 1 137 18
implication 1 137 18
is 1 137 18
that 1 137 18
at 1 137 18
least 1 137 18
50 1 137 18
percent 1 137 18
of 1 137 18
German 1 137 18
Catholic 1 137 18
children 1 137 18
never 1 137 18
see 1 137 18
their 1 137 18
parents 1 137 18
receive 1 137 18
communion 1 137 18
and 1 137 18
lose 1 137 18
their 1 137 18
faith 1 137 18
because 1 137 18
of 1 137 18
it. 1 137 18

This, 0 137 19
he 0 137 19
says, 0 137 19
is 0 137 19
“bad 1 137 19
for 1 137 19
evangelization,” 1 137 19
and 0 137 19
in 0 137 19
order 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
keep 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
pews 0 137 19
full, 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
Church’s 0 137 19
role 0 137 19
should 0 137 19
not 0 137 19
be 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
deny 0 137 19
communion 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
divorced 0 137 19
and 0 137 19
remarried, 0 137 19
but 0 137 19
instead 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
ask, 0 137 19
“What 0 137 19
can 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
Catholic 0 137 19
Church 0 137 19
do 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
make 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
faithful 0 137 19
able 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
receive 0 137 19
sacraments?” 0 137 19

I’m 0 137 21
not 0 137 21
entirely 0 137 21
unsympathetic 0 137 21
to. 0 137 21

However, 0 137 22
the 0 137 22
fact 0 137 22
remains 0 137 22
that 0 137 22
Faggioli 0 137 22
is 0 137 22
suggesting 0 137 22
the 0 137 22
Church 0 137 22
do 0 137 22
much 0 137 22
more 0 137 22
than 0 137 22
provide 0 137 22
sacraments 0 137 22
to 0 137 22
the 0 137 22
faithful. 0 137 22

Just 0 137 23
before 0 137 23
invoking 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
German 0 137 23
case, 0 137 23
Faggioli 0 137 23
characterized 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
country 0 137 23
as 0 137 23
one 0 137 23
of 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
most 0 137 23
secular 0 137 23
in 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
world. 0 137 23

But 0 137 24
rather 0 137 24
than 0 137 24
lamenting 0 137 24
what 0 137 24
secularism 0 137 24
has 0 137 24
wrought 0 137 24
on 0 137 24
marital 0 137 24
life 0 137 24
in 0 137 24
Germany, 0 137 24
reasserting 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
Church’s 0 137 24
position 0 137 24
on 0 137 24
marriage, 0 137 24
and 0 137 24
insisting 0 137 24
that 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
faithful 0 137 24
strive 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
live 0 137 24
according 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
her 0 137 24
laws, 0 137 24
Faggioli 0 137 24
argues 0 137 24
that 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
Church 0 137 24
ought 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
bend 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
will 0 137 24
of 0 137 24
secular 0 137 24
society. 0 137 24

It 0 137 26
should 0 137 26
be 0 137 26
clear 0 137 26
to 0 137 26
anyone, 0 137 26
not 0 137 26
just 0 137 26
practicing 0 137 26
Catholics, 0 137 26
that 0 137 26
this 0 137 26
is 0 137 26
absurd. 0 137 26

If 0 137 27
the 0 137 27
Church 0 137 27
exists 0 137 27
simply 0 137 27
to 0 137 27
accommodate 0 137 27
the 0 137 27
whims 0 137 27
and 0 137 27
failures 0 137 27
of 0 137 27
secular 0 137 27
modernity, 0 137 27
then 0 137 27
what 0 137 27
is 0 137 27
the 0 137 27
point 0 137 27
of 0 137 27
the 0 137 27
Church? 0 137 27

Pope 0 137 28
Benedict 0 137 28
XVI 0 137 28
has 0 137 28
warned 0 137 28
against 0 137 28
precisely 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
kind 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
“accommodation” 0 137 28
Faggioli 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
calling 0 137 28
for, 0 137 28
writing 0 137 28
that 0 137 28
when 0 137 28
“the 0 137 28
people 0 137 28
cannot 0 137 28
cope” 0 137 28
with 0 137 28
God, 0 137 28
they 0 137 28
“bring 0 137 28
him 0 137 28
down 0 137 28
into 0 137 28
their 0 137 28
own 0 137 28
world,” 0 137 28
and 0 137 28
insist 0 137 28
that 0 137 28
“he 0 137 28
must 0 137 28
be 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
kind 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
God 0 137 28
that 0 137 28
[they 0 137 28
need].” 0 137 28
In 0 137 28
other 0 137 28
words, 0 137 28
“Man 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
using 0 137 28
God, 0 137 28
and, 0 137 28
in 0 137 28
reality, 0 137 28
even 0 137 28
if 0 137 28
it 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
not 0 137 28
outwardly 0 137 28
discernible, 0 137 28
he 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
placing 0 137 28
himself 0 137 28
above 0 137 28
God.” 0 137 28
To 0 137 28
fully 0 137 28
drive 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
point 0 137 28
home, 0 137 28
Benedict 0 137 28
equates 0 137 28
this 0 137 28
kind 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
worship 0 137 28
with 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
Israelites 0 137 28
desert 0 137 28
worship 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
bull 0 137 28
calf. 0 137 28

Unsurprisingly, 0 137 29
this 0 137 29
progressive 0 137 29
interpretation 0 137 29
of 0 137 29
Catholic 0 137 29
doctrine 0 137 29
eventually 0 137 29
reveals 0 137 29
itself 0 137 29
to 0 137 29
be 0 137 29
rank 1 137 29
historicism. 1 137 29

Throughout 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
debate, 0 137 30
Faggioli 0 137 30
drew 0 137 30
out 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
argument 0 137 30
that 0 137 30
allowing 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
remarried 0 137 30
to 0 137 30
receive 0 137 30
communion 0 137 30
would 0 137 30
not 0 137 30
represent 0 137 30
a 0 137 30
radical 0 137 30
change 0 137 30
in 0 137 30
doctrine 0 137 30
but 0 137 30
a 0 137 30
return 0 137 30
to 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
teachings 0 137 30
of 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
Gospel. 0 137 30

Eventually, 0 137 31
Douthat 0 137 31
drew 0 137 31
his 0 137 31
argument 0 137 31
to 0 137 31
its 0 137 31
logical 0 137 31
conclusion 0 137 31
with 0 137 31
this 0 137 31
question: 0 137 31
Were 1 137 31
priests 1 137 31
throughout 1 137 31
history 1 137 31
in 1 137 31
fact 1 137 31
misleading 1 137 31
their 1 137 31
divorced 1 137 31
and 1 137 31
remarried 1 137 31
parishioners 1 137 31
by 1 137 31
telling 1 137 31
them 1 137 31
they 1 137 31
could 1 137 31
not 1 137 31
receive 1 137 31
communion? 1 137 31

After 0 137 32
a 0 137 32
few 0 137 32
seconds’ 0 137 32
pause, 0 137 32
Faggioli 0 137 32
gave 0 137 32
the 0 137 32
only 0 137 32
answer 0 137 32
he 0 137 32
could: 0 137 32
“There 1 137 32
are 1 137 32
different 1 137 32
responses 1 137 32
to 1 137 32
the 1 137 32
same 1 137 32
question 1 137 32
in 1 137 32
different 1 137 32
times.” 1 137 32

Throughout 0 137 34
their 0 137 34
conversation, 0 137 34
both 0 137 34
Douthat 0 137 34
and 0 137 34
Faggioli 0 137 34
repeatedly 0 137 34
observed 0 137 34
that 0 137 34
the 0 137 34
debate 0 137 34
over 0 137 34
Pope 0 137 34
Francis 0 137 34
and 0 137 34
the 0 137 34
future 0 137 34
of 0 137 34
the 0 137 34
Church 0 137 34
is 0 137 34
carried 0 137 34
on 0 137 34
primarily 0 137 34
among 0 137 34
Catholic 0 137 34
intellectuals, 0 137 34
unbeknownst 0 137 34
to 0 137 34
most 0 137 34
of 0 137 34
“the 0 137 34
flock.” 0 137 34

Advertisement 0 137 35

It 0 137 36
strikes 0 137 36
me, 0 137 36
however, 0 137 36
that 0 137 36
everybody 0 137 36
— 0 137 36
Catholic 0 137 36
or 0 137 36
not 0 137 36
— 0 137 36
has 1 137 36
a 1 137 36
dog 1 137 36
in 1 137 36
this 1 137 36
fight, 1 137 36
which 0 137 36
is 0 137 36
about 0 137 36
more 0 137 36
than 0 137 36
communion 0 137 36
and 0 137 36
canon 0 137 36
law. 0 137 36

At 0 137 37
its 0 137 37
core, 0 137 37
this 0 137 37
debate 0 137 37
is 0 137 37
about 0 137 37
truth 0 137 37
and 0 137 37
our 0 137 37
ability 0 137 37
to 0 137 37
judge 0 137 37
right 0 137 37
from 0 137 37
wrong. 0 137 37

Could 1 137 38
we 1 137 38
possibly 1 137 38
say, 1 137 38
for 1 137 38
instance, 1 137 38
that 1 137 38
it’s 1 137 38
impossible 1 137 38
to 1 137 38
judge 1 137 38
the 1 137 38
presidency 1 137 38
of 1 137 38
Donald 1 137 38
Trump 1 137 38
relative 1 137 38
to 1 137 38
past 1 137 38
presidents? 1 137 38

Of 0 137 39
course 0 137 39
not 0 137 39
— 0 137 39
that 0 137 39
would 0 137 39
be 0 137 39
preposterous, 0 137 39
as 0 137 39
I’m 0 137 39
sure 0 137 39
Faggioli 0 137 39
would 0 137 39
agree. 0 137 39

To 0 137 40
pass 0 137 40
moral 0 137 40
judgements 0 137 40
on 0 137 40
papacies, 0 137 40
presidencies, 0 137 40
or 0 137 40
anything 0 137 40
else, 0 137 40
we 0 137 40
must 0 137 40
have 0 137 40
recourse 0 137 40
to 0 137 40
truth, 0 137 40
and 0 137 40
to 0 137 40
the 0 137 40
institutions 0 137 40
that 0 137 40
have 0 137 40
upheld 0 137 40
this 0 137 40
truth 0 137 40
for 0 137 40
centuries. 0 137 40

Whether 0 137 41
in 0 137 41
the 0 137 41
Church 0 137 41
or 0 137 41
in 0 137 41
the 0 137 41
academy, 0 137 41
we 0 137 41
must 0 137 41
resist 0 137 41
this 0 137 41
dangerous 0 137 41
historicist 0 137 41
impulse. 0 137 41

If 1 137 42
we 1 137 42
don’t, 1 137 42
we 1 137 42
will 1 137 42
find 1 137 42
ourselves, 1 137 42
in 1 137 42
the 1 137 42
words 1 137 42
of 1 137 42
Pope 1 137 42
Benedict, 1 137 42
in 1 137 42
“a 1 137 42

of 1 137 42
relativism 1 137 42

does 1 137 42
not 1 137 42
recognize 1 137 42
anything 1 137 42

definitive 1 137 42

whose 1 137 42
ultimate 1 137 42

a 0 143 4
long, 0 143 4
long 0 143 4
time 0 143 4
it 0 143 4
also 0 143 4
provides 0 143 4
welcome 0 143 4
reminder 0 143 4
of 0 143 4
why 0 143 4
we 0 143 4
must 0 143 4
continue 0 143 4
to 0 143 4
fight. 0 143 4

Even 0 143 5
though 0 143 5
I 0 143 5
personally 0 143 5
was 0 143 5
in 0 143 5
attendance 0 143 5
back 0 143 5
in 0 143 5
1976 0 143 5
when 0 143 5
Archbishop 0 143 5
Lefebvre 0 143 5
delivered 0 143 5
this 0 143 5
address 0 143 5
in 0 143 5
Minneapolis, 0 143 5
I 0 143 5
was 0 143 5
only 0 143 5
ten 0 143 5
years 0 143 5
old 0 143 5
and 0 143 5
of 0 143 5
course 0 143 5
didn't 0 143 5
realize 0 143 5
how 0 143 5
prophetic 0 143 5
he 0 143 5
was 0 143 5
on 0 143 5
that 0 143 5
occasion, 0 143 5
or 0 143 5
how 0 143 5
devastated 0 143 5
by 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
Second 0 143 5
Vatican 0 143 5
Council, 0 143 5
the 0 143 5
New 0 143 5

of 0 143 5

In 0 143 6
fact, 0 143 6
this 0 143 6
transcript 0 143 6
reads 0 143 6
like 0 143 6
a 0 143 6
message 0 143 6
of 0 143 6
encouragement 0 143 6
at 0 143 6
a 0 143 6
crucial 0 143 6
moment 0 143 6
in 0 143 6
the 0 143 6
history 0 143 6
of 0 143 6
this 0 143 6
movement—Stay 0 143 6
in 1 143 6
the 1 143 6
fight! 1 143 6

Keep 1 143 7
the 1 143 7
Faith. 1 143 7

Never 1 143 8
surrender! 1 143 8

This 0 143 9
address 0 143 9
also 0 143 9
makes 0 143 9
it 0 143 9
absolutely 0 143 9
clear 0 143 9
that 0 143 9
everything 0 143 9
Archbishop 0 143 9
Lefebvre 0 143 9
did 0 143 9
was 0 143 9
part 0 143 9
of 0 143 9
an 0 143 9
eleventh-hour 0 143 9
defence 0 143 9
of 0 143 9
the 0 143 9
Kingship 0 143 9
of 0 143 9
Christ 0 143 9
(ignored 0 143 9
completely 0 143 9
by 0 143 9
the 0 143 9
Second 0 143 9
Vatican 0 143 9
Council) 0 143 9
and 0 143 9
a 0 143 9
desperate 0 143 9
last 0 143 9
stand 0 143 9
for 0 143 9
Tradition, 0 143 9
the 1 143 9
infallible 1 143 9
teachings 1 143 9
of 1 143 9
Mother 1 143 9
Church 1 143 9
and 0 143 9
of 0 143 9
course 0 143 9
her 0 143 9
ancient 0 143 9
liturgy. 0 143 9

And 0 143 10
now 0 143 10
that 0 143 10
Pope 0 143 10
Francis 0 143 10
has 0 143 10
inadvertently 0 143 10
unmasked 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
true 0 143 10
spirit 0 143 10
of 0 143 10
Vatican 0 143 10
II, 0 143 10
it 0 143 10
becomes 0 143 10
obvious 0 143 10
how 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
why 0 143 10
those 0 143 10
who 0 143 10
resisted 0 143 10
that 0 143 10
spirit 0 143 10
were 0 143 10
right 0 143 10
to 0 143 10
have 0 143 10
done 0 143 10
so 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
will 0 143 10
certainly 0 143 10
be 0 143 10
hailed 0 143 10
by 0 143 10
history 0 143 10
as 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
heroic 0 143 10
band 0 143 10
of 0 143 10
Catholic 0 143 10
brothers 0 143 10
that 0 143 10
mounted 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
twentieth 0 143 10
century’s 0 143 10
last 0 143 10
stand 0 143 10
for 0 143 10
Christ 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
King 0 143 10
and, 0 143 10
while 0 143 10
scorned 0 143 10
and 0 143 10
mocked 0 143 10
at 0 143 10
the 0 143 10
time, 0 143 10
were 0 143 10
nevertheless 0 143 10
totally 0 143 10
vindicated 0 143 10
fifty 0 143 10
years 0 143 10
later. 0 143 10

May 0 143 11
we 0 143 11
continue 0 143 11
to 0 143 11
earn 0 143 11
the 0 143 11
right 0 143 11
to 0 143 11
stand 0 143 11
with 0 143 11
them 0 143 11
today. 0 143 11

Ladies 0 143 14
and 0 143 14
Gentlemen: 0 143 14

As 0 143 15
I 0 143 15
said 0 143 15
to 0 143 15
Mr. 0 143 15
[Walter] 0 143 15
Matt, 0 143 15
I 0 143 15
can 0 143 15
say 0 143 15
in 0 143 15
bad 0 143 15
English 0 143 15
what 0 143 15
he 0 143 15
says 0 143 15
in 0 143 15
good 0 143 15
English, 0 143 15
because 0 143 15
he 0 143 15
said 0 143 15
all 0 143 15
of 0 143 15
the 0 143 15
things 0 143 15
I 0 143 15
want 0 143 15
to 0 143 15
say 0 143 15
[Referring 0 143 15
here 0 143 15
to 0 143 15
Walter 0 143 15
Matt’s 0 143 15
introductory 0 143 15
talk 0 143 15
referenced 0 143 15
above.] 0 143 15

And 0 143 16
I 0 143 16
thank 0 143 16
you, 0 143 16
Mr. 0 143 16
Matt, 0 143 16
very 0 143 16
much, 0 143 16
for 0 143 16
his 0 143 16
invitation, 0 143 16
and 0 143 16
I 0 143 16
thank 0 143 16
you 0 143 16
for 0 143 16
your 0 143 16
coming, 0 143 16
and 0 143 16
I 0 143 16
thank 0 143 16
Fr. 0 143 16

Ward 0 143 17
for 0 143 17
what 0 143 17
he 0 143 17
said 0 143 17
about 0 143 17
the 0 143 17
Society 0 143 17
of 0 143 17
St. 0 143 17
Pius 0 143 17
X. 0 143 17

And 0 143 18
I 0 143 18
hope 0 143 18
that 0 143 18
you 0 143 18
can 0 143 18
understand 0 143 18
my 0 143 18
poor 0 143 18
English, 0 143 18
but 0 143 18
I 0 143 18
think 0 143 18
it 0 143 18
is 0 143 18
better 0 143 18
to 0 143 18
speak 0 143 18
some 0 143 18
bad 0 143 18
English 0 143 18
because 0 143 18
to 0 143 18
translate 0 143 18
would 0 143 18
take 0 143 18
too 0 143 18
much 0 143 18
time. 0 143 18

As 0 143 19
Mr. 0 143 19
Matt 0 143 19
said, 0 143 19
the 0 143 19
crisis 0 143 19
in 0 143 19
the 0 143 19
Church 0 143 19
is 0 143 19
very 0 143 19
extraordinary. 0 143 19

It 0 143 20
is 0 143 20
very 0 143 20
difficult 0 143 20
to 0 143 20
understand 0 143 20
the 0 143 20
situation 0 143 20
today. 0 143 20

My 0 143 21
seminary 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
Econe 0 143 21
(in 0 143 21
Switzerland) 0 143 21
and 0 143 21
the 0 143 21
seminaries 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
Germany 0 143 21
and 0 143 21
here 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
America, 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
Armada, 0 143 21
are 0 143 21
in 0 143 21
very 0 143 21
difficult 0 143 21
situations 0 143 21
with 0 143 21
Rome. 0 143 21

Why? 0 143 22

These 0 143 23
seminaries 0 143 23
are 0 143 23
the 0 143 23
same 0 143 23
as 0 143 23
seminaries 0 143 23
were 0 143 23
before 0 143 23
the 0 143 23
Second 0 143 23
Vatican 0 143 23
Council. 0 143 23

They 0 143 24
have 0 143 24
the 0 143 24
same 0 143 24
discipline 0 143 24
and 0 143 24
the 0 143 24
same 0 143 24
studies, 0 143 24
they 0 143 24
make 0 143 24
good 0 143 24
priests; 0 143 24
I 0 143 24
think 0 143 24
they 0 143 24
are 0 143 24
good 0 143 24
seminarians. 0 143 24

All 0 143 25
is 0 143 25
done 0 143 25
as 0 143 25
all 0 143 25
the 0 143 25
seminaries 0 143 25
before 0 143 25
the 0 143 25
Second 0 143 25
Vatican 0 143 25
Council. 0 143 25

Why 0 143 26
are 0 143 26
we 0 143 26
now 0 143 26
in 0 143 26
this 0 143 26
very 0 143 26
sad 0 143 26
situation 0 143 26
with 0 143 26
Rome? 0 143 26

I 0 143 27
think 0 143 27
that 0 143 27
because 0 143 27
in 0 143 27
the 0 143 27
Second 0 143 27
Vatican 0 143 27
Council, 0 143 27
and 0 143 27
after 0 143 27
the 0 143 27
Council, 0 143 27
there 0 143 27
is 0 143 27
a 1 143 27
mutation, 1 143 27
a 1 143 27
change, 1 143 27
in 1 143 27
the 1 143 27
Church. 1 143 27

But 0 143 28
we 0 143 28
do 0 143 28
not 0 143 28
change. 0 143 28

We 0 143 29
continue 0 143 29
the 0 143 29
Tradition. 0 143 29

So 0 143 30
why 0 143 30
do 0 143 30
they 0 143 30
now 0 143 30
say, 0 143 30
as 0 143 30
Mgr. 0 143 30

(Archbishop) 0 143 31
Benelli[1] 0 143 31
said 0 143 31
to 0 143 31
me 0 143 31
months 0 143 31
ago 0 143 31
on 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
19th 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
March, 0 143 31
“you 0 143 31
are 0 143 31
out 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
communion 0 143 31
with 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Church.” 0 143 31
I 0 143 31
am 0 143 31
out 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
communion 0 143 31
with 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Church 0 143 31
because 0 143 31
I 0 143 31
continue 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Tradition 0 143 31
of 0 143 31
the 0 143 31
Church? 0 143 31

This 0 143 32
is 0 143 32
possible? 0 143 32

I 0 143 33
do 0 143 33
not 0 143 33
understand. 0 143 33

Why? 0 143 34

I 0 143 35
have 0 143 35
done 0 143 35
nothing. 0 143 35

I 0 143 36
believe 0 143 36
nothing 0 143 36
other 0 143 36
than 0 143 36
what 0 143 36
the 0 143 36
Church 0 143 36
has 0 143 36
believed 0 143 36
for 0 143 36
twenty 0 143 36
centuries. 0 143 36

Mgr. 0 143 37

Benelli 0 143 38
then 0 143 38
said 0 143 38
to 0 143 38
me, 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
must 0 143 38
put 0 143 38
down 0 143 38
in 0 143 38
a 0 143 38
writing 0 143 38
to 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
Holy 0 143 38
Father 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
accept 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
Second 0 143 38
Vatican 0 143 38
Council, 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
accept 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
reform 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
followed 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
Council, 0 143 38
and 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
you 0 143 38
accept 0 143 38
the 0 143 38
orientations 0 143 38
that 0 143 38
have 0 143 38
been 0 143 38
given 0 143 38
by 0 143 38
Rome. 0 143 38

Mgr. 0 143 39

Benelli 0 143 40
took 0 143 40
the 0 143 40
book 0 143 40
of 0 143 40
the 0 143 40
New 0 143 40
Ordo, 0 143 40
gave 0 143 40
it 0 143 40
to 0 143 40
me, 0 143 40
and 0 143 40
said, 0 143 40
“You 0 143 40
must 0 143 40
say 0 143 40
this 0 143 40
New 0 143 40
Mass 0 143 40
in 0 143 40
all 0 143 40
of 0 143 40
your 0 143 40
houses.” 0 143 40

I 0 143 41
wonder 0 143 41
why 0 143 41
Mgr. 0 143 41

Benelli 0 143 42
did 0 143 42
not 0 143 42
communicate 0 143 42
this 0 143 42
condition 0 143 42
to 0 143 42
me 0 143 42
before 0 143 42
our 0 143 42
meeting. 0 143 42

[2] 0 143 43
He 0 143 43
could 0 143 43
have 0 143 43
done 0 143 43
so. 0 143 43

For 0 143 44
example, 0 143 44
one 0 143 44
year 0 143 44
ago 0 143 44
three 0 143 44
cardinals 0 143 44
sent 0 143 44
me 0 143 44
a 0 143 44
letter 0 143 44
(Cardinals 0 143 44
Wright, 0 143 44
Tabera 0 143 44
[Arturo 0 143 44
Carinal 0 143 44
Tabera 0 143 44
Araoz, 0 143 44
one 0 143 44
of 0 143 44
the 0 143 44
Council 0 143 44
Fathers 0 143 44
MJM], 0 143 44
and 0 143 44
Gabriel-Marie 0 143 44
Garrone) 0 143 44
telling 0 143 44
me 0 143 44
(in 0 143 44
effect) 0 143 44
that 0 143 44
I 0 143 44
must 0 143 44
close 0 143 44
the 0 143 44
seminaries. 0 143 44

Well, 0 143 45
I 0 143 45
refused, 0 143 45
because 0 143 45
I 1 143 45
refuse 1 143 45
to 1 143 45
contribute 1 143 45
to 1 143 45
the 1 143 45
destruction 1 143 45
of 1 143 45
the 1 143 45
Church. 1 143 45

Because 0 143 46
now 0 143 46
they 0 143 46
are 0 143 46
destroying 1 143 46
the 1 143 46
Church. 1 143 46

When 0 143 47
I 0 143 47
die 0 143 47
and 0 143 47
go 0 143 47
before 0 143 47
the 0 143 47
judge, 0 143 47
God 0 143 47
will 0 143 47
not 0 143 47
be 0 143 47
able 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
say 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
me, 0 143 47
“You 1 143 47
destroyed 1 143 47
the 1 143 47
Church.” 1 143 47
I 0 143 47
refused 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
contribute 0 143 47
to 0 143 47
the 0 143 47
destruction 1 143 47
of 1 143 47
the 1 143 47
Church. 1 143 47

I 0 143 48
am 0 143 48
sure 0 143 48
that 0 143 48
my 0 143 48
seminaries 0 143 48
are 0 143 48
contributing 0 143 48
to 0 143 48
the 0 143 48
restoration 0 143 48
of 0 143 48
the 0 143 48
Church. 0 143 48

I 0 143 49
do 0 143 49
not 0 143 49
destroy 0 143 49
the 0 143 49
Church. 0 143 49

And 0 143 50
so 0 143 50
I 0 143 50
said 0 143 50
to 0 143 50
Mgr. 0 143 50

Benelli, 0 143 51
“No, 0 143 51
I 0 143 51
will 0 143 51
not 0 143 51
sign 0 143 51
that 0 143 51
writing.” 0 143 51

I 0 143 52
think 0 143 52
that 0 143 52
the 1 143 52
mutation 1 143 52
in 1 143 52
the 1 143 52
Church 1 143 52
came 0 143 52
in 0 143 52
through 0 143 52
the 0 143 52
Second 0 143 52
Vatican 0 143 52
Council. 0 143 52

And 0 143 53
do 0 143 53
you 0 143 53
think 0 143 53
this 0 143 53
change 0 143 53
in 0 143 53
the 0 143 53
Church 0 143 53
came 0 143 53
suddenly? 0 143 53

When, 0 143 54
then? 0 143 54

At 0 143 55
the 0 143 55
beginning 0 143 55
of 0 143 55
the 0 143 55
Council? 0 143 55

No, 0 143 56
this 0 143 56
change 0 143 56
in 0 143 56
the 0 143 56
Church 0 143 56
began 0 143 56
one 0 143 56
century 0 143 56
before 0 143 56
[the 0 143 56
Council]. 0 143 56

Pope 0 143 57
Pius 0 143 57
VI 0 143 57
said 0 143 57
during 0 143 57
the 0 143 57
French 0 143 57
Revolution 0 143 57
that 0 143 57
if 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
Church 1 143 57
continues 1 143 57
to 1 143 57
remain 1 143 57
under 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
influence 1 143 57
of 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
prince 1 143 57
of 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
revolution, 1 143 57
then, 1 143 57
in 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
future 1 143 57
a 1 143 57
crisis 1 143 57
will 1 143 57
come 1 143 57
upon 1 143 57
the 1 143 57
Church. 1 143 57

In 0 143 58
[1844], 0 143 58
Pope 0 143 58
Pius 0 143 58
IX 0 143 58
ordered 0 143 58
Cardinal 0 143 58
Rigoli 0 143 58
to 0 143 58
publish 0 143 58
the 0 143 58
Instructions 0 143 58
of 0 143 58
the 0 143 58
Carbonari. 0 143 58

[3] 0 143 59
The 0 143 59
Pope 0 143 59
himself 0 143 59
asked 0 143 59
Cardinal 0 143 59
Rigoli 0 143 59
to 0 143 59
publish 0 143 59
the 0 143 59
Instructions 0 143 59
of 0 143 59
the 0 143 59
Carbonari. 0 143 59

And 0 143 60
what 0 143 60
did 0 143 60
these 0 143 60
Instructions 0 143 60
say? 0 143 60

The 0 143 61
Instructions 0 143 61
said 0 143 61
that 0 143 61
they 0 143 61
[the 0 143 61
Carbonari/Freemasons] 0 143 61
must 0 143 61
begin 0 143 61
to 0 143 61
fight 0 143 61
against 0 143 61
the 0 143 61
Church 0 143 61
by 0 143 61
bringing 0 143 61
reform 0 143 61
into 0 143 61
the 0 143 61
Church. 0 143 61

The 0 143 62
Instructions 0 143 62
said 0 143 62
the 0 143 62
infiltration 0 143 62
will 0 143 62
take 0 143 62
perhaps 0 143 62
not 0 143 62
one 0 143 62
year, 0 143 62
perhaps 0 143 62
not 0 143 62
ten 0 143 62
years, 0 143 62
but 0 143 62
perhaps 0 143 62
a 0 143 62
century. 0 143 62

The 0 143 63
Carbonari 0 143 63
must 0 143 63
enter 0 143 63
into 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
seminary, 0 143 63
into 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
convent, 0 143 63
into 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
sacristy, 0 143 63
and 0 143 63
slowly, 0 143 63
very 0 143 63
slowly, 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
priests 0 143 63
will 0 143 63
have 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
ideals 0 143 63
of 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
revolution; 0 143 63
of 0 143 63
the 0 143 63
Freemasons. 0 143 63

One 0 143 64
day 0 143 64
these 0 143 64
priests, 0 143 64
imbued 0 143 64
with 0 143 64
Masonic 0 143 64
principles, 0 143 64
will 0 143 64
become 0 143 64
bishops, 0 143 64
and 0 143 64
these 0 143 64
bishops 0 143 64
can 0 143 64
then 0 143 64
choose 0 143 64
a 0 143 64
pope. 0 143 64

And 0 143 65
even 0 143 65
if 0 143 65
the 0 143 65
pope 0 143 65
is 0 143 65
not 0 143 65
a 0 143 65
Freemason, 0 143 65
he 0 143 65
will 0 143 65
have 0 143 65
the 0 143 65
same 0 143 65
ideals 0 143 65
as 0 143 65
the 0 143 65
Freemasons. 0 143 65

Pope 0 143 66
Pius 0 143 66
IX 0 143 66
called 0 143 66
for 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
publishing 0 143 66
of 0 143 66
these 0 143 66
Instructions 0 143 66
in 0 143 66
order 0 143 66
to 0 143 66
warn 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
bishops 0 143 66
and 0 143 66
priests 0 143 66
of 0 143 66
those 0 143 66
times 0 143 66
of 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
fight 0 143 66
against 0 143 66
the 0 143 66
church. 0 143 66

In 0 143 67
1895, 0 143 67
the 0 143 67
Catholic 0 143 67
Antonia 0 143 67
Fogazzaro, 0 143 67
a 0 143 67
known 0 143 67
modernist, 0 143 67
founded 0 143 67
a 0 143 67
masonic 0 143 67
lodge 0 143 67
in 0 143 67
Milan. 0 143 67

He 0 143 68
wrote 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
his 0 143 68
book, 0 143 68
Il 0 143 68
Santo, 0 143 68
that 0 143 68
“We 0 143 68
[modernists]…want 0 143 68
a 0 143 68
reform 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
the 0 143 68
Church…without 0 143 68
rebellion, 0 143 68
carried 0 143 68
out 0 143 68
by 0 143 68
legitimate 0 143 68
authority…even 0 143 68
if 0 143 68
this 0 143 68
takes 0 143 68
20, 0 143 68
30, 0 143 68
or 0 143 68
50 0 143 68
years.”[4] 0 143 68
“The 0 143 68
reform 0 143 68
will 0 143 68
have 0 143 68
to 0 143 68
be 0 143 68
brought 0 143 68
about 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
the 0 143 68
name 0 143 68
of 0 143 68
obedience.” 0 143 68
The 0 143 68
modernist 0 143 68
ideas 0 143 68
in 0 143 68
the 0 143 68
Church 0 143 68
introduced 0 143 68
and 0 143 68
enacted 0 143 68
through 0 143 68
obedience! 0 143 68

And 0 143 69
I 0 143 69
think…well, 0 143 69
here 0 143 69
we 0 143 69
are! 0 143 69

In 0 143 70
this 0 143 70
time! 0 143 70

The 0 143 71
reform 0 143 71
is 0 143 71
here, 0 143 71
and 0 143 71
it 0 143 71
is 0 143 71
brought 0 143 71
about 0 143 71
through 0 143 71
obedience, 0 143 71
to 0 143 71
the 0 143 71
Council, 0 143 71
to 0 143 71
the 0 143 71
bishop, 0 143 71
to 0 143 71
the 0 143 71
priest. 0 143 71

And 0 143 72
all 0 143 72
they 0 143 72
say 0 143 72
is 0 143 72
“Obedience, 0 143 72
obedience, 0 143 72
obedience.” 0 143 72

The 0 143 73
Instructions 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
Carbonari 0 143 73
say 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
bishop 0 143 73
and 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
priest 0 143 73
will 0 143 73
think 0 143 73
that 0 143 73
they 0 143 73
are 0 143 73
following 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
tiara 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
Pope, 0 143 73
but 0 143 73
they 0 143 73
will 0 143 73
be 0 143 73
following 0 143 73
the 0 143 73
flag 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
Freemasonry 0 143 73
[“the 0 143 73
banner 0 143 73
of 0 143 73
revolution”]. 0 143 73

They 1 143 74
said 1 143 74
that. 1 143 74

They 1 143 75
wrote 1 143 75
that! 1 143 75

One 0 143 76
century 0 143 76
before 0 143 76
[the 0 143 76
Council]! 0 143 76

Thus, 0 143 77
it 0 143 77
is 0 143 77
very 0 143 77
important 0 143 77
to 0 143 77
know 0 143 77
that 0 143 77
they 0 143 77
prepared 0 143 77
for 0 143 77
the 0 143 77
beginning 0 143 77
of 0 143 77
the 0 143 77
Second 0 143 77
Vatican 0 143 77
Council 0 143 77
for 0 143 77
a 0 143 77
century, 0 143 77
perhaps 0 143 77
two 0 143 77
centuries! 0 143 77

As 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Archbishop 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
Dakar 0 143 78
and 0 143 78
President 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Episcopal 0 143 78
Commission 0 143 78
for 0 143 78
French-speaking 0 143 78
West 0 143 78
Africa, 0 143 78
I 0 143 78
was 0 143 78
appointed 0 143 78
member 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Central 0 143 78
Preparatory 0 143 78
Commission 0 143 78
of 0 143 78
the 0 143 78
Second 0 143 78
Vatican 0 143 78
Council. 0 143 78

There 0 143 79
were 0 143 79
some 0 143 79
seventy 0 143 79
cardinals, 0 143 79
twenty 0 143 79
bishops, 0 143 79
and 0 143 79
four 0 143 79
super-authorities 0 143 79
of 0 143 79
the 0 143 79
religious 0 143 79
orders, 0 143 79
among 0 143 79
others. 0 143 79

Before 0 143 80
the 0 143 80
last 0 143 80
meeting 0 143 80
of 0 143 80
this 0 143 80
Commission 0 143 80
the 0 143 80
members 0 143 80
received 0 143 80
two 0 143 80
schemas 0 143 80
on 0 143 80
the 0 143 80
same 0 143 80
subject: 0 143 80
one 0 143 80
from 0 143 80
Cardinal 0 143 80
Ottaviani 0 143 80
and 0 143 80
another 0 143 80
from 0 143 80
Cardinal 0 143 80
Bea. 0 143 80

The 0 143 81
schema 0 143 81
from 0 143 81
Cardinal 0 143 81
Ottaviani 0 143 81
was 0 143 81
titled 0 143 81
“…On 0 143 81
Religious 0 143 81
Tolerance” 0 143 81
and 0 143 81
the 0 143 81
other, 0 143 81
from 0 143 81
Cardinal 0 143 81
Bea, 0 143 81
was 0 143 81
titled 0 143 81
“On 0 143 81
Religious 0 143 81
Freedom 0 143 81
[Liberty].” 0 143 81
When 0 143 81
we 0 143 81
read 0 143 81
these 0 143 81
two 0 143 81
schemas, 0 143 81
we 0 143 81
thought, 0 143 81
“This 0 143 81
is 0 143 81
impossible. 0 143 81

How 0 143 82
is 0 143 82
it 0 143 82
we 0 143 82
can 0 143 82
receive 0 143 82
two 0 143 82
opposing 0 143 82
theses? 0 143 82

One 0 143 83
says 0 143 83
we 0 143 83
must 0 143 83
not 0 143 83
tolerate 0 143 83
error. 0 143 83

The 0 143 84
other 0 143 84
says 0 143 84
that 0 143 84
error 0 143 84
has 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
right 0 143 84
to 0 143 84
exist 0 143 84
in 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
name 0 143 84
of 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
dignity 0 143 84
of 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
human 0 143 84
person.” 0 143 84
And 0 143 84
so, 0 143 84
we 0 143 84
go 0 143 84
into 0 143 84
the 0 143 84
meeting. 0 143 84

Cardinal 0 143 85
Ottaviani, 0 143 85
standing, 0 143 85
says 0 143 85
to 0 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Bea, 0 143 85
“You 1 143 85
have 1 143 85
no 1 143 85
authority 1 143 85
to 1 143 85
compose 1 143 85
this 1 143 85
schema, 1 143 85
because 1 143 85
it 1 143 85
is 1 143 85
a 1 143 85
theological 1 143 85
thesis 1 143 85
and 1 143 85
therefore 1 143 85
within 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
competence 1 143 85
of 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
Theological 1 143 85
Commission.” 1 143 85
As 0 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Bea 0 143 85
stands 0 143 85
up, 0 143 85
he 0 143 85
says, 0 143 85
“I 0 143 85
do 1 143 85
have 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
right 1 143 85
to 1 143 85
compose 1 143 85
this 1 143 85
schema 1 143 85
because 1 143 85
if 1 143 85
anything 1 143 85
concerns 1 143 85
Christian 1 143 85
Unity 1 143 85
it 1 143 85
is 1 143 85
religious 1 143 85
liberty, 1 143 85
and 1 143 85
I 1 143 85
am 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
President 1 143 85
of 1 143 85
the 1 143 85
Secretariat 1 143 85
for 1 143 85
Promoting 1 143 85
Christian 1 143 85
Unity.” 1 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Bea, 0 143 85
addressing 0 143 85
Cardinal 0 143 85
Ottaviani, 0 143 85
further 0 143 85
said, 0 143 85
“I 0 143 85
am 0 143 85
opposed 0 143 85
to 0 143 85
your 0 143 85
schema.” 0 143 85

Impossible! 1 143 86

We 1 143 87
were 1 143 87
in 1 143 87
a 1 143 87
very 1 143 87
sad, 1 143 87
serious 1 143 87
situation. 1 143 87

Cardinal 0 143 88
Ruffini 0 143 88
had 0 143 88
to 0 143 88
intervene 0 143 88
as 0 143 88
we 0 143 88
were 0 143 88
in 0 143 88
front 0 143 88
of 0 143 88
two 0 143 88
cardinals, 0 143 88
our 0 143 88
brothers. 0 143 88

He 0 143 89
said 0 143 89
we 0 143 89
must 0 143 89
wait 0 143 89
for 0 143 89
the 0 143 89
authority 0 143 89
to 0 143 89
say 0 143 89
who 0 143 89
is 0 143 89
right 0 143 89
and 0 143 89
who 0 143 89
is 0 143 89
wrong. 0 143 89

But 0 143 90
before 0 143 90
the 0 143 90
Pope 0 143 90
came 0 143 90
(because 0 143 90
the 0 143 90
Pope 0 143 90
came 0 143 90
many 0 143 90
times 0 143 90
to 0 143 90
present 0 143 90
at 0 143 90
these 0 143 90
meetings) 0 143 90
we 0 143 90
voted 0 143 90
on 0 143 90
the 0 143 90
schema. 0 143 90

Who 0 143 91
is 0 143 91
with 0 143 91
Cardinal 0 143 91
Ottaviani? 0 143 91

Who 0 143 92
is 0 143 92
with 0 143 92
Cardinal 0 143 92
Bea? 0 143 92

The 0 143 93
conservatives 0 143 93
and 0 143 93
the 0 143 93
liberals. 0 143 93

As 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
last 0 143 94
meeting 0 143 94
of 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
Preparatory 0 143 94
Commission, 0 143 94
it 0 143 94
was 0 143 94
for 0 143 94
me 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
first 0 143 94
image 0 143 94
of 0 143 94
the 0 143 94
future 0 143 94
Council. 0 143 94

This 0 143 95
historic 0 143 95
address 0 143 95
appeared 0 143 95
for 0 143 95
the 0 143 95
first 0 143 95
time 0 143 95
ever 0 143 95
in 0 143 95
a 0 143 95

edition 0 143 95
of 0 143 95
The 0 143 95
Remnant 0 143 95
last 0 143 95
year. 0 143 95

Isn't 0 143 96
it 0 143 96
time 0 143 96
for 0 143 96
you 0 143 96
to 0 143 96
subscribe? 0 143 96

And 0 143 97
as 0 143 97
we 0 143 97
go 0 143 97
into 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
Council, 0 143 97
you 0 143 97
know 0 143 97
that 0 143 97
on 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
first 0 143 97
day 0 143 97
of 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
Council, 0 143 97
Cardinal 0 143 97
Lienart 0 143 97
was 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
chief 0 143 97
of 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
liberal 0 143 97
cardinals 0 143 97
in 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
Council, 0 143 97
[together] 0 143 97
with 0 143 97
all 0 143 97
of 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
Cardinals 0 143 97
of 0 143 97
the 0 143 97
Rhine 0 143 97
(such 0 143 97
as 0 143 97
Cardinal 0 143 97
Alfrink, 0 143 97
Cardinal 0 143 97
Frings, 0 143 97
Cardinal 0 143 97
Dopfner, 0 143 97
Cardinal 0 143 97

and 0 143 97
Cardinal 0 143 97
Koenig 0 143 97
of 0 143 97
Austria). 0 143 97

And 0 143 98
now 0 143 98
one 0 143 98
month 0 143 98
ago 0 143 98
in 0 143 98
Rome, 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
traditional 0 143 98
periodical 0 143 98
Chiesa 0 143 98
Viva 0 143 98
published 0 143 98
a 0 143 98
photo 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Cardinal 0 143 98
Lienart 0 143 98
with 0 143 98
all 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
appurtenances 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry, 1 143 98
the 0 143 98
date 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
his 0 143 98
inscription 0 143 98
in 0 143 98
Masonry, 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
date 0 143 98
[of 0 143 98
his 0 143 98
rising 0 143 98
to] 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
20th 0 143 98
Degree 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry, 1 143 98
the 0 143 98
date 0 143 98
[of 0 143 98
his 0 143 98
rising 0 143 98
to] 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
30th 0 143 98
Degree 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry, 1 143 98
and 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
places 0 143 98
where 0 143 98
he 0 143 98
[attended] 0 143 98
the 0 143 98
meetings 0 143 98
of 0 143 98
Freemasonry. 1 143 98

This 0 143 99
Cardinal 0 143 99
was 0 143 99
the 0 143 99
chief 0 143 99
of 0 143 99
the 0 143 99
liberals 0 143 99
in 0 143 99
the 0 143 99
Council. 0 143 99

That 0 143 100
is 0 143 100
my 0 143 100
cardinal; 0 143 100
he 0 143 100
ordained 0 143 100
me 0 143 100
to 0 143 100
the 0 143 100
priesthood, 0 143 100
and 0 143 100
he 0 143 100
consecrated 0 143 100
me 0 143 100
a 0 143 100
bishop. 0 143 100

And 0 143 101
now 0 143 101
this 0 143 101
is 0 143 101
public. 0 143 101

Nobody 0 143 102
has 0 143 102
been 0 143 102
able 0 143 102
to 0 143 102
refute 0 143 102
the 0 143 102
publication. 0 143 102

And 0 143 103
so, 0 143 103
we 0 143 103
have 0 143 103
(I 0 143 103
am 0 143 103
confident) 0 143 103
a 1 143 103
mutation 1 143 103
in 1 143 103
the 1 143 103
church 1 143 103
by 0 143 103
the 0 143 103
Council 0 143 103
and 0 143 103
by 0 143 103
the 0 143 103
reform 0 143 103
after 0 143 103
the 0 143 103
Council. 0 143 103

Now, 0 143 104
some 0 143 104
say 0 143 104
the 0 143 104
Council 0 143 104
is 0 143 104
(was) 0 143 104
good, 0 143 104
but 0 143 104
only 0 143 104
the 0 143 104
reforms 0 143 104
were 0 143 104
bad. 0 143 104

That 0 143 105
is 0 143 105
not 0 143 105
true. 0 143 105

Why? 0 143 106

Because 0 143 107
when 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
reforms 0 143 107
come, 0 143 107
Rome 0 143 107
always 0 143 107
says 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
reforms 0 143 107
are 0 143 107
being 0 143 107
done 0 143 107
in 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
name 0 143 107
of 0 143 107
the 0 143 107
Council. 0 143 107

In 1 143 108
the 1 143 108
name 1 143 108
of 1 143 108
the 1 143 108
Council! 1 143 108

It 0 143 109
is 0 143 109
evident 0 143 109
that 0 143 109
all 0 143 109
of 0 143 109
the 0 143 109
reforms 0 143 109
came 0 143 109
from 0 143 109
the 0 143 109
Council. 0 143 109

And 0 143 110
if 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
reforms 1 143 110
are 1 143 110
bad, 1 143 110
then 1 143 110
it 1 143 110
is 1 143 110
impossible 1 143 110
that 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
Council 1 143 110
is 1 143 110
good 1 143 110
and 1 143 110
all 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
reforms 1 143 110
are 1 143 110
bad, 1 143 110
because 1 143 110
that 1 143 110
is 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
authentic 1 143 110
interpretation 1 143 110
of 1 143 110
the 1 143 110
Council 1 143 110
by 1 143 110
Rome. 1 143 110

Rome 0 143 111
said 0 143 111
in 0 143 111
the 0 143 111
name 0 143 111
of 0 143 111
the 0 143 111
Declaration 0 143 111
of 0 143 111
Liturgy, 0 143 111
we 0 143 111
[implement] 0 143 111
the 0 143 111
liturgical 0 143 111
reform. 0 143 111

We 0 143 112
can 0 143 112
say 0 143 112
that 0 143 112
[these 0 143 112
bad 0 143 112
changes 0 143 112
are] 0 143 112
not 0 143 112
in 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
text 0 143 112
of 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
Declaration, 0 143 112
but 0 143 112
this 0 143 112
man 0 143 112
has 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
authority 0 143 112
to 0 143 112
say 0 143 112
that 0 143 112
this 0 143 112
is 0 143 112
from 0 143 112
the 0 143 112
Council. 0 143 112

They 0 143 113
know 0 143 113
that. 0 143 113

And 0 143 114
I 0 143 114
am 0 143 114
sure 0 143 114
that 0 143 114
it 0 143 114
[the 0 143 114
mutation] 0 143 114
is 0 143 114
in 0 143 114
the 0 143 114
Council. 0 143 114

Even 0 143 115
if 0 143 115
it 0 143 115
is 0 143 115
not 0 143 115
explicitly 0 143 115
[stated] 0 143 115
in 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
Council 0 143 115
but 0 143 115
[rather] 0 143 115
in 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
spirit 0 143 115
of 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
Council, 0 143 115
it 0 143 115
is 0 143 115
the 0 143 115
same! 0 143 115

For 0 143 116
example, 0 143 116
with 0 143 116
religious 0 143 116
freedom: 0 143 116
now 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Holy 0 143 116
See 0 143 116
and 0 143 116
all 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Nuncios 0 143 116
are 0 143 116
against 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Catholic 0 143 116
State 0 143 116
in 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
name 0 143 116
of 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Council 0 143 116
- 0 143 116
in 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
name 0 143 116
of 0 143 116
the 0 143 116
Declaration 0 143 116
of 0 143 116
Religious 0 143 116
Freedom. 0 143 116

I 0 143 117
have 0 143 117
heard 0 143 117
this 0 143 117
(personally) 0 143 117
twice. 0 143 117

The 0 143 118
first 0 143 118
time 0 143 118
I 0 143 118
was 0 143 118
in 0 143 118
Columbia. 0 143 118

When 0 143 119
I 0 143 119
was 0 143 119
in 0 143 119
Columbia, 0 143 119
I 0 143 119
read 0 143 119
in 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
paper 0 143 119
about 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
change 0 143 119
in 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
first 0 143 119
article 0 143 119
of 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
Constitution 0 143 119
of 0 143 119
the 0 143 119
Republic 0 143 119
of 0 143 119
Columbia. 0 143 119

[The 0 143 120
first 0 143 120
article] 0 143 120
stated 0 143 120
that 0 143 120
only 0 143 120
the 0 143 120
Republic 0 143 120
of 0 143 120
Columbia 0 143 120
recognizes 0 143 120
only 0 143 120
the 0 143 120
Catholic 0 143 120
religion. 0 143 120

They 0 143 121
changed 0 143 121
it. 0 143 121

They 0 143 122
removed 0 143 122
this 0 143 122
article. 0 143 122

I 0 143 123
read 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
discourse 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
President 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
Columbia 0 143 123
with 0 143 123
the 0 143 123
Nuncios 0 143 123
of 0 143 123
Columbia 0 143 123
and 0 143 123
the 0 143 123

Columbia. 0 143 123

The 0 143 124
President 0 143 124
said 0 143 124
he 0 143 124
is 0 143 124
very, 1 143 124
very 1 143 124
anxious. 1 143 124

He 0 143 125
said 0 143 125
to 0 143 125
the 0 143 125
people, 0 143 125
“even 0 143 125
though 0 143 125
we 0 143 125
remove 0 143 125
this 0 143 125
article 0 143 125
we 0 143 125
remain 0 143 125
Catholic. 0 143 125

I 0 143 126
am 0 143 126
a 0 143 126

I 0 143 126
shall 0 143 126
remain 0 143 126
Catholic, 0 143 126
and 0 143 126
I 1 143 126
do 1 143 126
everything 1 143 126
possible 1 143 126
for 1 143 126
the 1 143 126

our 1 143 126

Then, 0 143 127
the 0 143 127
discourse 0 143 127
of 0 143 127
the 0 143 127
Nuncio 0 143 127

a 0 143 127
Freemason: 0 143 127
all 0 143 127
of 0 143 127
it 0 143 127
was 0 143 127
“progress,” 0 143 127
“humanity,” 0 143 127
“evolution,” 0 143 127
and 0 143 127
all 0 143 127
the 0 143 127

of 0 143 127
a 0 143 127

And 0 143 128
during 0 143 128
the 0 143 128
discourse 0 143 128
of 0 143 128
the 0 143 128
Secretary 0 143 128

Episcopal 0 143 128
Conference, 0 143 128
[the 0 143 128
Secretary] 0 143 128
said, 0 143 128
“in 1 143 128

I 0 143 129
met 0 143 129
this 0 143 129

of 0 143 129
the 0 143 129

my 0 143 129

in 0 143 129
Columbia, 0 143 129
and 0 143 129
he 0 143 129
said 0 143 129
for 0 143 129
two 0 143 129
years 0 143 129
they 0 143 129
[had 0 143 129
been 0 143 129
asking] 0 143 129
the 0 143 129
President, 0 143 129
in 1 143 129
the 1 143 129

the 1 143 129
Holy 1 143 129
See, 1 143 129
to 0 143 129

this 0 143 129
article 0 143 129
in 0 143 129
their 0 143 129
Constitution. 0 143 129

But 0 143 130
I 0 143 130
will 0 143 130
never…I 0 143 130
do 0 143 130
not 0 143 130
accept 0 143 130
the 0 143 130
concept, 0 143 130
because 0 143 130
you 0 143 130
destroy 0 143 130
the 0 143 130
Catholic 0 143 130
State 0 143 130
in 0 143 130
the 0 143 130

Council. 0 143 130

Are 0 143 131
you 0 143 131
sure? 0 143 131

Yes, 0 143 132
sure. 0 143 132

It 0 143 133
is 0 143 133
evident. 0 143 133

Now 0 143 134
I 0 143 134
said 0 143 134
to 0 143 134
the 0 143 134
[Secretary], 0 143 134
“As 0 143 134
I 0 143 134

(Because 0 143 135
you 0 143 135
know 0 143 135
Switzerland 0 143 135

a 0 143 135

And 0 143 138
[the 0 143 138
Secretary] 0 143 138
said, 0 143 138
“Yes, 0 143 138
I 0 143 138
am 0 143 138

Brother, 0 143 138
what 0 143 138
did 0 143 138
you 0 143 138

is 0 143 139
this 0 143 139
for 0 143 139
you? 0 143 139

What 0 143 140
do 0 143 140
you 0 143 140
say 0 143 140
when 0 143 140
you 0 143 140
say 0 143 140
“thy 0 143 140
kingdom 0 143 140
come” 0 143 140
in 0 143 140
your 0 143 140
prayer, 0 143 140
the 0 143 140
Our 0 143 140
Father? 0 143 140

“Ah,” 0 143 141
the 0 143 141
Nuncio 0 143 141
said 0 143 141
to 0 143 141
me, 0 143 141
“Now 0 143 141
it 0 143 141
is 0 143 141
impossible.” 0 143 141
What 0 143 141
did 0 143 141
you 0 143 141
do 0 143 141
with 0 143 141
the 0 143 141
encyclical 0 143 141
of 0 143 141
Pope 0 143 141
Pius 0 143 141
XI, 0 143 141
Quas 0 143 141
Primas? 0 143 141

“Ah, 0 143 142
but 0 143 142
now 0 143 142
the 0 143 142
Pope 0 143 142
cannot 0 143 142
write 0 143 142
an 0 143 142
encyclical 0 143 142
like 0 143 142
Quas 0 143 142
Primas.” 0 143 142

It 0 143 143
is 0 143 143
incredible. 0 143 143

And 0 143 144
all 0 143 144
in 1 143 144
the 1 143 144
name 1 143 144
of 1 143 144
the 1 143 144
Council. 1 143 144

We 1 143 145
must 1 143 145
take 1 143 145
care, 1 143 145
because 1 143 145
this 1 143 145
change 1 143 145
in 1 143 145
the 1 143 145
church 1 143 145
is 1 143 145
a 1 143 145
liberal 1 143 145
change. 1 143 145

The 1 143 146
liberal 1 143 146
principles 1 143 146
have 1 143 146
entered 1 143 146
the 1 143 146
Church 1 143 146
now, 1 143 146
and 1 143 146
they 1 143 146
destroy 1 143 146
the 1 143 146
Church. 1 143 146

If 0 143 147
we 0 143 147
cannot 0 143 147
set 0 143 147
out 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
true 0 143 147
principles 0 143 147
of 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
Church, 0 143 147
if 0 143 147
we 0 143 147
in 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
name 0 143 147
of 0 143 147
religious 0 143 147
freedom 0 143 147
said 0 143 147
that 0 143 147
all 0 143 147
religions 0 143 147
have 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
same 0 143 147
right 0 143 147
in 0 143 147
every 0 143 147

in 0 143 147
the 0 143 147
world… 0 143 147

[missing 0 143 148
audio...] 0 143 148

The 0 143 149
truth 0 143 149
is 0 143 149
the 0 143 149
only 0 143 149
one 0 143 149
King 0 143 149
of 0 143 149
the 0 143 149
World 0 143 149
is 0 143 149
Jesus 0 143 149
Christ. 0 143 149

We 0 143 150
say 0 143 150
in 0 143 150
the 0 143 150
Gloria 0 143 150
in 0 143 150
Excelsis 0 143 150
Deo, 0 143 150
“Tu 0 143 150
solus 0 143 150
Altissimus,” 0 143 150
“Tu 0 143 150
solus 0 143 150
Dominus,” 0 143 150
“You 0 143 150
alone 0 143 150

the 0 143 150
Highest,” 0 143 150
“You 0 143 150
alone 0 143 150
are 0 143 150
the 0 143 150
Lord.” 0 143 150
But 0 143 150
practically, 0 143 150
we 0 143 150
would 0 143 150
refuse 0 143 150
this 0 143 150
Kingdom 0 143 150
of 0 143 150
Jesus 0 143 150
Christ 0 143 150
if 0 143 150
we 0 143 150
said 0 143 150
that 0 143 150
Luther, 0 143 150
Mohammed, 0 143 150
Buddha 0 143 150
and 0 143 150
Jesus 0 143 150
Christ 0 143 150
are 0 143 150
all 0 143 150
the 0 143 150
same. 0 143 150

We 0 143 151
cannot 0 143 151
say 0 143 151
that. 0 143 151

Impossible. 1 143 152

We 0 143 153
know 0 143 153
that 0 143 153
in 0 143 153
many 0 143 153
states 0 143 153
(it 0 143 153
is 0 143 153
a 0 143 153
pity) 0 143 153
it 0 143 153
is 0 143 153
impossible 0 143 153
[to 0 143 153
recognize 0 143 153
Catholicism 0 143 153
as 0 143 153
the 0 143 153
state 0 143 153
religion]. 0 143 153

We 1 143 154
must 1 143 154
tolerate 1 143 154
- 1 143 154
have 1 143 154
tolerance 1 143 154
for 1 143 154
the 1 143 154
error 1 143 154
- 1 143 154
but 1 143 154
never 1 143 154
give 1 143 154
the 1 143 154
same 1 143 154
right 1 143 154
to 1 143 154
error 1 143 154
and 1 143 154
truth. 1 143 154

That 1 143 155
is 1 143 155
impossible. 1 143 155

And 0 143 156
the 0 143 156
change 0 143 156
in 0 143 156
the 0 143 156
liturgy 0 143 156
is 0 143 156
very 0 143 156
important. 0 143 156

It 0 143 157
is 0 143 157
very 0 143 157
bad. 0 143 157

One 0 143 158
of 0 143 158
the 0 143 158
principles 0 143 158
of 0 143 158
modern 0 143 158
man, 0 143 158
as 0 143 158
they 0 143 158
say 0 143 158
now, 0 143 158
“modern 0 143 158
man,” 0 143 158
is 0 143 158
democracy. 0 143 158

And 0 143 159
democracy 0 143 159
can 0 143 159
have 0 143 159
a 0 143 159
good 0 143 159
sense 0 143 159
but 0 143 159
not 0 143 159
if 0 143 159
[by 0 143 159
that 0 143 159
term 0 143 159
is 0 143 159
meant] 0 143 159
that 0 143 159
those 0 143 159
who 0 143 159
govern 0 143 159
receive 0 143 159
their 0 143 159
authority 0 143 159
from 0 143 159
the 0 143 159
people. 0 143 159

The 1 143 160
authority 1 143 160
comes 1 143 160
from 1 143 160
God. 1 143 160

Not 1 143 161
from 1 143 161
the 1 143 161
people. 1 143 161

Not 1 143 162
from 1 143 162
the 1 143 162
masses. 1 143 162

From 1 143 163
God. 1 143 163

But 0 143 164
today 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
principle, 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
democratic 1 143 164
principle, 1 143 164
is 0 143 164
that 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
authority 0 143 164
is 0 143 164
in 0 143 164
the 0 143 164
people. 0 143 164

It 0 143 165
is 0 143 165
in 1 143 165
the 1 143 165
masses. 1 143 165

That 0 143 166
is 0 143 166
not 0 143 166
true. 0 143 166

It 0 143 167
is 0 143 167
impossible. 0 143 167

And 0 143 168
our 0 143 168
liturgy 0 143 168
is 0 143 168
the 0 143 168
school 0 143 168
of 0 143 168
our 0 143 168
Faith. 0 143 168

It 0 143 169
is 0 143 169
the 0 143 169
first 0 143 169
school 0 143 169
of 0 143 169
our 0 143 169
Faith 0 143 169
for 0 143 169
all 0 143 169
people. 0 143 169

I 0 143 170
was 0 143 170
in 0 143 170
Africa 0 143 170
as 0 143 170
a 0 143 170
missionary 0 143 170
and 0 143 170
as 0 143 170
bishop 0 143 170
for 0 143 170
30 0 143 170
years. 0 143 170

I 0 143 171
know 0 143 171
the 0 143 171
liturgy 0 143 171
was 0 143 171
the 0 143 171
best 0 143 171
school 0 143 171
of 0 143 171
the 0 143 171
Faith 0 143 171
for 0 143 171
people 0 143 171
who 0 143 171
cannot 0 143 171
read. 0 143 171

They 0 143 172
can 0 143 172
see 0 143 172
what 0 143 172
the 0 143 172
priest 0 143 172
does. 0 143 172

They 0 143 173
can 0 143 173
see 0 143 173
what 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
priest 0 143 173
does 0 143 173
at 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
adoration 0 143 173
of 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
Body 0 143 173
and 0 143 173
the 0 143 173
Blood 0 143 173
of 0 143 173
Jesus 0 143 173
Christ. 0 143 173

And 0 143 174
they 0 143 174
know 0 143 174
that 0 143 174
Jesus 0 143 174
Christ 0 143 174
is 0 143 174
present 0 143 174
- 0 143 174
His 0 143 174
real 0 143 174
presence 0 143 174
is 0 143 174
on 0 143 174
the 0 143 174
altar 0 143 174
- 0 143 174
by 0 143 174
the 0 143 174
attitude 0 143 174
of 0 143 174
the 0 143 174
priest. 0 143 174

They 0 143 175
know 0 143 175
that. 0 143 175

That 0 143 176
is 0 143 176
very 0 143 176
important. 0 143 176

But 0 143 177
the 0 143 177
change 0 143 177
in 0 143 177
the 0 143 177
Mass 0 143 177
destroys 1 143 177
the 1 143 177
Church. 1 143 177

Because 0 143 178
we 0 143 178
know 0 143 178
the 0 143 178
liturgy 0 143 178
teaches 0 143 178
us 0 143 178
hierarchy. 0 143 178

The 0 143 179
true 0 143 179
liturgy 0 143 179
is 0 143 179
hierarchical. 0 143 179

It 0 143 180
is 0 143 180
not 0 143 180
democratic 0 143 180
but 0 143 180
hierarchical. 1 143 180

Why? 0 143 181

Because 0 143 182
we 0 143 182
have 0 143 182
God, 0 143 182
the 0 143 182
priest, 0 143 182
and 0 143 182
then 0 143 182
the 0 143 182
people. 0 143 182

That 0 143 183
is 0 143 183
hierarchy. 0 143 183

When 0 143 184
we 0 143 184
are 0 143 184
in 0 143 184
Church 0 143 184
we 0 143 184
know 0 143 184
God 0 143 184
is 0 143 184
on 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
altar; 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
priest 0 143 184
is 0 143 184
between 0 143 184
God 0 143 184
and 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
people; 0 143 184
and 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
people 0 143 184
receive 0 143 184
God 0 143 184
at 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
hand 0 143 184
of 0 143 184
the 0 143 184
priest. 0 143 184

That 1 143 185
is 1 143 185
hierarchy. 1 143 185

But 0 143 186
now 0 143 186
the 0 143 186
new 0 143 186
liturgy 0 143 186
is 0 143 186
more 0 143 186
democratic 0 143 186
- 0 143 186
all 0 143 186
around 0 143 186
the 0 143 186
table. 0 143 186

The 0 143 187
priest 0 143 187
is 0 143 187
only 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
president, 0 143 187
and 0 143 187
sometimes 0 143 187
another 0 143 187
man 0 143 187
can 0 143 187
take 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
role 0 143 187
of 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
president 0 143 187
of 0 143 187
the 0 143 187
meal. 0 143 187

That 0 143 188
is 0 143 188
a 0 143 188
new 0 143 188
liturgy. 0 143 188

That 0 143 189
is 0 143 189
very 0 143 189
bad, 0 143 189
because 0 143 189
we 0 143 189
have 0 143 189
no 0 143 189
sense 0 143 189
of 0 143 189
the 0 143 189
hierarchical; 0 143 189
whereas 0 143 189
the 0 143 189
sense 0 143 189
of 0 143 189
hierarchy 0 143 189
is 0 143 189
very 0 143 189
important 0 143 189
in 0 143 189
our 0 143 189
life. 0 143 189

We 0 143 190
need 0 143 190
the 0 143 190
authority 0 143 190
of 0 143 190
God. 0 143 190

We 0 143 191
need 0 143 191
the 0 143 191
Real 0 143 191
Presence 0 143 191
of 0 143 191
God 0 143 191
on 0 143 191
our 0 143 191
altar. 0 143 191

We 0 143 192
need 0 143 192
the 0 143 192
Sacrifice 0 143 192
of 0 143 192
the 0 143 192
Mass 0 143 192
– 0 143 192
not 0 143 192
a 0 143 192
meal 0 143 192
only 0 143 192
– 0 143 192
but 0 143 192
the 0 143 192
Sacrifice. 0 143 192

So, 0 143 193
the 0 143 193
Victim 0 143 193
of 0 143 193
the 0 143 193
Sacrifice 0 143 193
is 0 143 193
really 0 143 193
present 0 143 193
on 0 143 193
our 0 143 193
altar. 0 143 193

That 0 143 194
is 0 143 194
the 0 143 194
school 0 143 194
of 0 143 194
our 0 143 194
Faith. 0 143 194

And 0 143 195
slowly, 0 143 195
slowly, 0 143 195
this 0 143 195
new 0 143 195
Mass 0 143 195
equivocates. 0 143 195

It 0 143 196
moves 0 143 196
the 0 143 196
minds 0 143 196
of 0 143 196
the 0 143 196
faithful 0 143 196
in 0 143 196
a 0 143 196
Protestant 0 143 196
[direction]. 0 143 196

I 0 143 197
do 0 143 197
not 0 143 197
say 0 143 197
that 0 143 197
all 0 143 197
[Novus 0 143 197
Ordo] 0 143 197
Masses 0 143 197
are 0 143 197
invalid. 0 143 197

I 1 143 198
do 1 143 198
not 1 143 198
say 1 143 198
that. 1 143 198

But 0 143 199
perhaps, 0 143 199
more 0 143 199
and 0 143 199
more, 0 143 199
they 0 143 199
become 0 143 199
invalid 0 143 199
because 0 143 199
[the 0 143 199
ministers 0 143 199
lose 0 143 199
faith 0 143 199
in 0 143 199
the 0 143 199
Real 0 143 199
Presence]. 0 143 199

Recently, 0 143 200
in 0 143 200
France, 0 143 200
a 0 143 200
progressive 0 143 200
paper 0 143 200
conducted 0 143 200
a 0 143 200
statistical 0 143 200
survey 0 143 200
to 0 143 200
see 0 143 200
how 0 143 200
many 0 143 200
priests 0 143 200
no 0 143 200
longer 0 143 200
have 0 143 200
faith 0 143 200
in 0 143 200
the 0 143 200
Real 0 143 200
Presence. 0 143 200

They 0 143 201
found 0 143 201
that 0 143 201
twenty-two 0 143 201
percent 0 143 201
no 0 143 201
longer 0 143 201
have 0 143 201
the 0 143 201
faith, 0 143 201
the 1 143 201
belief 1 143 201
in 0 143 201
the 0 143 201
Real 0 143 201
Presence. 0 143 201

But 0 143 202
I 0 143 202
think 0 143 202
that 0 143 202
if 0 143 202
they 0 143 202
directed 0 143 202
this 0 143 202
question 0 143 202
to 0 143 202
all 0 143 202
of 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
priests 0 143 202
who 0 143 202
are 0 143 202
under 0 143 202
50 0 143 202
years 0 143 202
of 0 143 202
age, 0 143 202
they 0 143 202
would 0 143 202
find 0 143 202
that 0 143 202
fifty 0 143 202
percent 0 143 202
[have 0 143 202
lost 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
faith 0 143 202
in 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
Real 0 143 202
Presence], 0 143 202
because 0 143 202
the 0 143 202
young 0 143 202
priests 0 143 202
have 0 143 202
no 0 143 202
faith. 0 143 202

No 1 143 203
faith. 1 143 203

Last 0 143 204
year, 0 143 204
Bishop 0 143 204
Adam 0 143 204
(in 0 143 204
our 0 143 204
Diocese 0 143 204
of 0 143 204
Sion, 0 143 204
Switzerland) 0 143 204
ordained 0 143 204
one 0 143 204
priest 0 143 204
for 0 143 204
my 0 143 204
Congregation 0 143 204
of 0 143 204
the 0 143 204
Holy 0 143 204
Ghost 0 143 204
Fathers. 0 143 204

This 0 143 205
one 0 143 205
priest 0 143 205
came 0 143 205
from 0 143 205
France. 0 143 205

His 0 143 206
uncle 0 143 206
had 0 143 206
died 0 143 206
in 0 143 206
a 0 143 206
road 0 143 206
accident 0 143 206
when 0 143 206
his 0 143 206
cab 0 143 206
fell 0 143 206
in 0 143 206
the 0 143 206
river. 0 143 206

The 0 143 207
uncle 0 143 207
had 0 143 207
nine 0 143 207
children. 0 143 207

The 0 143 208
Bishop 0 143 208
said 0 143 208
to 0 143 208
the 0 143 208
new 0 143 208
priest, 0 143 208
“Now 0 143 208
you 0 143 208
can 0 143 208
say 0 143 208
Mass 0 143 208
for 0 143 208
your 0 143 208
uncle. 0 143 208

Now 0 143 209
you 0 143 209
are 0 143 209
a 0 143 209
priest, 0 143 209
and 0 143 209
you 0 143 209
can 0 143 209
say 0 143 209
Mass 0 143 209
for 0 143 209
your 0 143 209
uncle.” 0 143 209
The 0 143 209
new 0 143 209
priest 0 143 209
said, 0 143 209
“No, 0 143 209
never.” 0 143 209
Why? 0 143 209

It 0 143 210
is 0 143 210
not 0 143 210
useful 0 143 210
to 0 143 210
say 0 143 210
Mass 0 143 210
for 0 143 210
the 0 143 210
dead? 0 143 210

“No, 0 143 211
no, 0 143 211
it 0 143 211
is 0 143 211
impossible. 0 143 211

They 0 143 212
are 0 143 212
already 0 143 212
in 0 143 212
heaven.” 0 143 212
This 0 143 212
young 0 143 212
priest 0 143 212
who 0 143 212
was 0 143 212
ordained 0 143 212
by 0 143 212
the 0 143 212
Bishop 0 143 212
last 0 143 212
year 0 143 212
for 0 143 212
my 0 143 212
Congregation 0 143 212
is 0 143 212
now 0 143 212
a 0 143 212
professor 0 143 212
in 0 143 212
the 0 143 212
minor 0 143 212
seminary 0 143 212
in 0 143 212
Switzerland. 0 143 212

They 0 143 213
are 0 143 213
not 0 143 213
learning 0 143 213
theology, 0 143 213
not 0 143 213
philosophy, 0 143 213
not 0 143 213
anything. 0 143 213

They 1 143 214
learn 1 143 214
nothing 1 143 214
now. 1 143 214

Another 0 143 215
example. 0 143 215

Recently, 0 143 216
I 0 143 216
had 0 143 216
two 0 143 216
young 0 143 216
[potential] 0 143 216
seminarians 0 143 216
come 0 143 216
to 0 143 216
my 0 143 216
house 0 143 216
near 0 143 216
Paris. 0 143 216

One 0 143 217
of 0 143 217
them 0 143 217
works 0 143 217
in 0 143 217
a 0 143 217
factory, 0 143 217
and 0 143 217
the 0 143 217
other 0 143 217
is 0 143 217
a 0 143 217
university 0 143 217
student. 0 143 217

They 0 143 218
told 0 143 218
me 0 143 218
they 0 143 218
were 0 143 218
[considering] 0 143 218
the 0 143 218
seminary 0 143 218
of 0 143 218
Paris. 0 143 218

I 0 143 219
asked 0 143 219
them, 0 143 219
“Why 0 143 219
do 0 143 219
you 0 143 219
come 0 143 219
to 0 143 219
see 0 143 219
me?” 0 143 219
They 0 143 219
told 0 143 219
me 0 143 219
that 0 143 219
they 0 143 219
had 0 143 219
a 0 143 219
meeting 0 143 219
in 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
house 0 143 219
of 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
Oblate 0 143 219
of 0 143 219
Maria 0 143 219
with 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
priest 0 143 219
who 0 143 219
oversees 0 143 219
young 0 143 219
men 0 143 219
who 0 143 219
may 0 143 219
have 0 143 219
vocations 0 143 219
to 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
priesthood 0 143 219
in 0 143 219
the 0 143 219
Diocese 0 143 219
of 0 143 219
Paris. 0 143 219

There 0 143 220
was 0 143 220
a 0 143 220
total 0 143 220
of 0 143 220
fifteen 0 143 220
young 0 143 220
men 0 143 220
for 0 143 220
all 0 143 220
of 0 143 220
the 0 143 220
Diocese 0 143 220
of 0 143 220
Paris. 0 143 220

During 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
meeting, 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
priest, 0 143 221
before 0 143 221
he 0 143 221
celebrated 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
Eucharist, 0 143 221
said, 0 143 221
“Today 0 143 221
we 0 143 221
celebrate 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
Eucharist, 0 143 221
but 0 143 221
we 0 143 221
do 0 143 221
not 0 143 221
believe 0 143 221
in 0 143 221
the 0 143 221
Real 0 143 221
Presence.” 0 143 221
These 0 143 221
two 0 143 221
young 0 143 221
men 0 143 221
said 0 143 221
“That 0 143 221
is 0 143 221
impossible. 1 143 221

We 0 143 222
cannot 0 143 222
remain 0 143 222
in 0 143 222
this 0 143 222
seminary.” 0 143 222
So, 0 143 222
they 0 143 222
came 0 143 222
to 0 143 222
meet 0 143 222
me. 0 143 222

They 0 143 223
said 0 143 223
that 0 143 223
Econe 0 143 223
is 0 143 223
the 0 143 223
only 0 143 223
seminary 0 143 223
where 0 143 223
they 0 143 223
seem 0 143 223
to 0 143 223
be 0 143 223
able 0 143 223
to 0 143 223
find 0 143 223
the 0 143 223
True 0 143 223
Faith. 0 143 223

They 0 143 224
asked 0 143 224
for 0 143 224
admittance 0 143 224
to 0 143 224
Econe. 0 143 224

And 0 143 225
I 0 143 225
think 0 143 225
that 0 143 225
they 0 143 225
shall 0 143 225
be 0 143 225
coming 0 143 225
to 0 143 225
Econe 0 143 225
next 0 143 225
October. 0 143 225

But 0 143 226
that 0 143 226
is 0 143 226
a 0 143 226
new 0 143 226
religion. 0 143 226

It 0 143 227
is 0 143 227
a 0 143 227
Protestant 0 143 227
religion. 0 143 227

That 1 143 228
is 1 143 228
a 1 143 228
fact. 1 143 228

Perhaps 0 143 229
you 0 143 229
can 0 143 229
say, 0 143 229
“How 1 143 229
is 1 143 229
it 1 143 229
possible 1 143 229
that 1 143 229
the 1 143 229
pope 1 143 229
gives 1 143 229
the 1 143 229
authorization 1 143 229
to 1 143 229
this 1 143 229
change? 1 143 229

How 1 143 230
is 1 143 230
it 1 143 230
possible 1 143 230
the 1 143 230
pope 1 143 230
signed 1 143 230
this 1 143 230
decree? 1 143 230

Signed 1 143 231
this 1 143 231
constitution?” 1 143 231
I 0 143 231
don’t 0 143 231
know. 0 143 231

I 1 143 232
don’t 1 143 232
know. 1 143 232

It 0 143 233
is 0 143 233
a 0 143 233
big 0 143 233
mystery. 0 143 233

A 1 143 234
big 1 143 234
mystery. 1 143 234

There 0 143 235
are 0 143 235
many 0 143 235
proposed 0 143 235
theological 0 143 235
answers. 0 143 235

I 0 143 236
cannot 0 143 236
subscribe 0 143 236
to 0 143 236
all 0 143 236
of 0 143 236
them. 0 143 236

Some 0 143 237
say 0 143 237
the 0 143 237
pope 0 143 237
is 0 143 237
not 0 143 237
responsible. 0 143 237

Perhaps 0 143 238
someone 0 143 238
gave 0 143 238
the 0 143 238
pope 0 143 238
an 0 143 238
injection, 0 143 238
a 0 143 238
drug, 0 143 238
and 0 143 238
he 0 143 238
is 0 143 238
not 0 143 238
responsible. 0 143 238

Perhaps, 0 143 239
I 0 143 239
don’t 0 143 239
know. 0 143 239

Some 0 143 240
say 0 143 240
there 0 143 240
are 0 143 240
two 0 143 240
popes 0 143 240
[(a 0 143 240
body 0 143 240
double)]. 0 143 240

I 1 143 241
don’t 1 143 241
know. 1 143 241

Some 0 143 242
say 0 143 242
the 0 143 242
pope 0 143 242
was 0 143 242
liberal 0 143 242
before 0 143 242
he 0 143 242
was 0 143 242
elected 0 143 242
pope, 0 143 242
and 0 143 242
perhaps 0 143 242
(we 0 143 242
do 0 143 242
not 0 143 242
know) 0 143 242
he 0 143 242
gave 0 143 242
his 0 143 242
name 0 143 242
to 0 143 242
Freemasonry 0 143 242
(thereby 0 143 242
incurring 0 143 242
excommunication 0 143 242
before 0 143 242
the 0 143 242
conclave). 0 143 242

We 0 143 243
do 0 143 243
not 0 143 243
know. 0 143 243

We 0 143 244
do 0 143 244
know 0 143 244
now 0 143 244
that 0 143 244
Bugnini 0 143 244
was 0 143 244
primarily 0 143 244
responsible 0 143 244
for 0 143 244
the 0 143 244
change 0 143 244
in 0 143 244
liturgy, 0 143 244
and 0 143 244
that 0 143 244
he 1 143 244
is 1 143 244
an 1 143 244
infamous 1 143 244
Freemason. 1 143 244

And 0 143 245
because 0 143 245
he 0 143 245
had 0 143 245
an 0 143 245
indiscretion 0 143 245
with 0 143 245
his 0 143 245
Masonic 0 143 245
appurtenances, 0 143 245
the 0 143 245
Pope 0 143 245
sent 0 143 245
him 0 143 245
as 0 143 245
a 0 143 245
Nuncio 0 143 245
in 0 143 245
Iran. 0 143 245

I 1 143 246
don’t 1 143 246
know. 1 143 246

We 1 143 247
don’t 1 143 247
know. 1 143 247

Now, 0 143 248
you 0 143 248
cannot 0 143 248
say 0 143 248
that 0 143 248
Archbishop 0 143 248
Lefebvre 0 143 248
said 0 143 248
the 0 143 248
pope 0 143 248
gave 0 143 248
his 0 143 248
name 0 143 248
to 0 143 248
Freemasonry. 0 143 248

No, 0 143 249
you 0 143 249
cannot 0 143 249
say 0 143 249
that. 0 143 249

It 0 143 250
is 0 143 250
possible, 0 143 250
but 0 143 250
we 1 143 250
do 1 143 250
not 1 143 250
know. 1 143 250

But 0 143 251
if 0 143 251
he 0 143 251
was 0 143 251
excommunicated, 0 143 251
then 0 143 251
he 0 143 251
is 0 143 251
not 0 143 251
pope. 0 143 251

Not 1 143 252
pope. 1 143 252

Illegitimate. 0 143 253

I 0 143 254
don’t 0 143 254
know. 0 143 254

It 0 143 255
is 0 143 255
a 0 143 255
mystery 0 143 255
I 0 143 255
cannot 0 143 255
understand. 0 143 255

But 0 143 256
the 0 143 256
fact 0 143 256
is 0 143 256
that 0 143 256
the 0 143 256
Catholic 0 143 256
Church 0 143 256
is 0 143 256
being 0 143 256
destroyed, 0 143 256
and 0 143 256
now 0 143 256
even 0 143 256
the 0 143 256
pope 0 143 256
himself 0 143 256
says 0 143 256
that. 0 143 256

This 0 143 257
pope 0 143 257
has 0 143 257
referred 0 143 257
to 0 143 257
the 0 143 257
auto-demolition 0 143 257
of 0 143 257
the 0 143 257
Church. 0 143 257

He 0 143 258
said, 0 143 258
“The 0 143 258
smoke 1 143 258
of 1 143 258
Satan 1 143 258
has 0 143 258
entered 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
Church.” 0 143 258
But 0 143 258
where 0 143 258
are 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
men 0 143 258
responsible 0 143 258
for 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
destruction 0 143 258
of 0 143 258
the 0 143 258
Church? 0 143 258

Well, 0 143 259
there 0 143 259
they 0 143 259
are. 0 143 259

They 0 143 260
are 0 143 260
the 0 143 260
men 0 143 260
who 0 143 260
destroy 0 143 260
the 0 143 260
Church. 0 143 260

We 0 143 261
must 0 143 261
show 0 143 261
where 0 143 261
they 0 143 261
are. 0 143 261

Where 0 143 262
is 0 143 262
this 0 143 262
smoke 1 143 262
of 1 143 262
Satan 1 143 262
that 0 143 262
has 0 143 262
entered 0 143 262
the 0 143 262
Church? 0 143 262

I 0 143 263
do 0 143 263
not 0 143 263
know, 0 143 263
but 0 143 263
it 0 143 263
is 0 143 263
the 0 143 263
pope 0 143 263
himself 0 143 263
who 0 143 263
said 0 143 263
that. 0 143 263

And 0 143 264
I 0 143 264
have 0 143 264
these 0 143 264
experiences 0 143 264
every 0 143 264
day. 0 143 264

I 0 143 265
visit 0 143 265
many 0 143 265
countries. 0 143 265

I 0 143 266
was 0 143 266
in 0 143 266
Spain 0 143 266
during 0 143 266
the 0 143 266
Christmas 0 143 266
Holy 0 143 266
Days. 0 143 266

Then 0 143 267
I 0 143 267
was 0 143 267
in 0 143 267
Bonn, 0 143 267
near 0 143 267
Cologne, 0 143 267
Germany, 0 143 267
three 0 143 267
weeks 0 143 267
ago, 0 143 267
to 0 143 267
speak 0 143 267
at 0 143 267
a 0 143 267
conference. 0 143 267

Many 0 143 268
people 0 143 268
came. 0 143 268

Many 0 143 269
people 0 143 269
are 0 143 269
confused. 0 143 269

What 0 143 270
is 0 143 270
happening 0 143 270
in 0 143 270
the 0 143 270
Church? 0 143 270

They 0 143 271
are 0 143 271
anxious. 0 143 271

But 0 143 272
many 0 143 272
people 0 143 272
say 0 143 272
that 0 143 272
we 0 143 272
disobey. 0 143 272

Disobey? 0 143 273

Obedience 0 143 274
is 0 143 274
relative. 0 143 274

It 0 143 275
is 0 143 275
not 0 143 275
absolute. 0 143 275

It 0 143 276
is 0 143 276
relative 0 143 276
to 0 143 276
the 0 143 276
good, 0 143 276
but 0 143 276
not 0 143 276
to 0 143 276
the 0 143 276
evil. 0 143 276

We 0 143 277
cannot 0 143 277
obey 0 143 277
our 0 143 277
parents 0 143 277
if 0 143 277
they 0 143 277
command 0 143 277
a 0 143 277
bad 0 143 277
thing. 0 143 277

We 0 143 278
cannot 0 143 278
obey. 0 143 278

It 0 143 279
is 0 143 279
clear. 0 143 279

And 0 143 280
I 0 143 280
know 0 143 280
that 0 143 280
in 0 143 280
Spain, 0 143 280
for 0 143 280
example, 0 143 280
the 0 143 280
situation 0 143 280
in 0 143 280
the 0 143 280
Church 0 143 280
is 0 143 280
very 0 143 280
bad. 0 143 280

The 0 143 281
new 0 143 281
nominees 0 143 281
of 0 143 281
bishops 0 143 281
and 0 143 281
many 0 143 281
auxiliary 0 143 281
bishops 0 143 281
are, 0 143 281
approximately, 0 143 281
communist, 0 143 281
Marxist, 0 143 281
and 0 143 281
socialist. 0 143 281

And 0 143 282
so, 0 143 282
a 0 143 282
majority 0 143 282
of 0 143 282
the 0 143 282
bishops 0 143 282
in 0 143 282
the 0 143 282
Episcopal 0 143 282
Conference 0 143 282
of 0 143 282
Spain 0 143 282
are 0 143 282
progressives. 0 143 282

They 0 143 283
are 0 143 283
modernists. 0 143 283

Whereas, 0 143 284
the 0 143 284
majority 0 143 284
of 0 143 284
the 0 143 284
bishops 0 143 284
[from 0 143 284
Spain] 0 143 284
during 0 143 284
the 0 143 284
Council 0 143 284
were 0 143 284
conservative. 0 143 284

So, 0 143 285
Rome 0 143 285
is 0 143 285
responsible 0 143 285
[for 0 143 285
the 0 143 285
situation 0 143 285
of 0 143 285
the 0 143 285
Church 0 143 285
in 0 143 285
Spain] 0 143 285
because 0 143 285
it 0 143 285
is 0 143 285
Rome 0 143 285
who 0 143 285
approves 0 143 285
the 0 143 285
nominations 0 143 285
for 0 143 285
bishops. 0 143 285

And 0 143 286
we 0 143 286
know 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
France, 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
Germany, 0 143 286
and 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
Europe 0 143 286
generally, 0 143 286
that 0 143 286
all 0 143 286
of 0 143 286
the 0 143 286
young 0 143 286
bishops 0 143 286
are 0 143 286
worse 0 143 286
[than 0 143 286
the 0 143 286
bishops 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
Spain] 0 143 286
in 0 143 286
that 0 143 286
they 0 143 286
are 0 143 286
more 0 143 286
or 0 143 286
less 0 143 286
Marxist. 0 143 286

That 0 143 287
is 0 143 287
a 0 143 287
fact. 0 143 287

That 0 143 288
is 0 143 288
impossible. 0 143 288

How 0 143 289
can 0 143 289
they 0 143 289
do 0 143 289
that? 0 143 289

I 0 143 290
do 0 143 290
not 0 143 290
know. 0 143 290

I 1 143 291
do 1 143 291
not 1 143 291
know. 1 143 291

I 0 143 292
have 0 143 292
not 0 143 292
spent 0 143 292
my 0 143 292
whole 0 143 292
life 0 143 292
in 0 143 292
Rome. 0 143 292

I 0 143 293
do 0 143 293
know 0 143 293
Rome 0 143 293
very 0 143 293
well, 0 143 293
because 0 143 293
I 0 143 293
was 0 143 293
an 0 143 293
apostolic 0 143 293
delegate, 0 143 293
and 0 143 293
I 0 143 293
was 0 143 293
in 0 143 293
the 0 143 293
Secretariate 0 143 293
of 0 143 293
the 0 143 293
Secretary 0 143 293
of 0 143 293
State. 0 143 293

And 0 143 294
I 0 143 294
know 0 143 294
that 0 143 294
very 0 143 294
well. 0 143 294

But 0 143 295
I 0 143 295
think 0 143 295
that 0 143 295
the 1 143 295
devil 1 143 295
is 1 143 295
in 1 143 295
Rome, 1 143 295
as 0 143 295
was 0 143 295
said 0 143 295
by 0 143 295
our 0 143 295
Lady 0 143 295
of 0 143 295
Fatima 0 143 295
and 0 143 295
Our 0 143 295
Lady 0 143 295
of 0 143 295
La 0 143 295
Salette. 0 143 295

We 0 143 296
must 0 143 296
pray. 0 143 296

We 0 143 297
must 0 143 297
ask 0 143 297
God 0 143 297
to 0 143 297
put 0 143 297
an 0 143 297
end 0 143 297
to 0 143 297
this 0 143 297
crisis 0 143 297
of 0 143 297
the 0 143 297
Church. 0 143 297

Because 1 143 298
if 1 143 298
this 1 143 298
crisis 1 143 298
continues, 1 143 298
many 1 143 298
people 1 143 298
will 1 143 298
go 1 143 298
to 1 143 298
hell. 1 143 298

They 0 143 299
lose 0 143 299
the 0 143 299
faith. 0 143 299

They 0 143 300
cannot 0 143 300
go 0 143 300
into 0 143 300
the 0 143 300
church. 0 143 300

They 0 143 301
abandon 0 143 301
the 0 143 301
faith. 0 143 301

You 0 143 302
know 0 143 302
that 0 143 302
many 0 143 302
priests 0 143 302
have 0 143 302
abandoned 0 143 302
the 0 143 302
faith. 0 143 302

Many 0 143 303
priests 0 143 303
have 0 143 303
gotten 0 143 303
married. 0 143 303

And 0 143 304
many 0 143 304
sisters 0 143 304
have 0 143 304
abandoned 0 143 304
their 0 143 304
congregations. 0 143 304

It 0 143 305
is 0 143 305
a 0 143 305
pity. 0 143 305

And 0 143 306
it 0 143 306
is 0 143 306
everywhere. 0 143 306

I 0 143 307
was 0 143 307
in 0 143 307
Melbourne, 0 143 307
Australia, 0 143 307
during 0 143 307
the 0 143 307
40th 0 143 307
International 0 143 307
Eucharistic 0 143 307
Congress. 0 143 307

Cardinal 0 143 308
Knox, 0 143 308
who 0 143 308
was 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
man 0 143 308
responsible 0 143 308
for 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
Eucharistic 0 143 308
Congress, 0 143 308
is 0 143 308
now 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
Prefect 0 143 308
of 0 143 308
the 0 143 308
Congregation 0 143 308
for 0 143 308
Divine 0 143 308
Worship. 0 143 308

I 0 143 309
read 0 143 309
in 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
newspaper 0 143 309
about 0 143 309
a 0 143 309
Mass 0 143 309
Cardinal 0 143 309
Knox 0 143 309
celebrated 0 143 309
during 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
Eucharistic 0 143 309
Congress 0 143 309
where 0 143 309
sensual 1 143 309
dancing 1 143 309
was 0 143 309
performed 0 143 309
at 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
same 0 143 309
time 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
words 0 143 309
of 0 143 309
the 0 143 309
Consecration 0 143 309
were 0 143 309
pronounced. 0 143 309

That 0 143 310
is 0 143 310
a 0 143 310
sacrilege. 1 143 310

You 0 143 311
cannot 0 143 311
go 0 143 311
to 0 143 311
that 0 143 311
Mass. 0 143 311

That 1 143 312
is 1 143 312
sacrilege. 1 143 312

This 0 143 313
is 0 143 313
a 0 143 313
fact. 0 143 313

They 0 143 314
also 0 143 314
called 0 143 314
me 0 143 314
by 0 143 314
phone 0 143 314
in 0 143 314
Melbourne 0 143 314
to 0 143 314
say 0 143 314
I 0 143 314
was 0 143 314
on 0 143 314
the 0 143 314
list 0 143 314
of 0 143 314
the 0 143 314
bishops 0 143 314
[attending] 0 143 314
the 0 143 314
Eucharistic 0 143 314
Congress. 0 143 314

They 0 143 315
asked 0 143 315
me 0 143 315
to 0 143 315
concelebrate 0 143 315
Mass 0 143 315
with 0 143 315
a 0 143 315
Protestant 0 143 315
pastor 0 143 315
and 0 143 315
a 0 143 315
rabbi. 0 143 315

Ay. 1 143 316

Impossible. 1 143 317

Impossible. 1 143 318

No, 1 143 319
no, 1 143 319
no, 1 143 319
no. 1 143 319

[applause] 0 143 320

This 0 143 321
change 0 143 321
is 0 143 321
not 0 143 321
accidental. 0 143 321

It 0 143 322
is 0 143 322
not 0 143 322
superficial. 0 143 322

It 0 143 323
is 0 143 323
very 0 143 323
deep. 0 143 323

Very 0 143 324
bad. 0 143 324

It 0 143 325
is 0 143 325
against 0 143 325
our 0 143 325
faith. 0 143 325

Against 1 143 326
our 1 143 326
faith. 1 143 326

And 0 143 327
so, 0 143 327
we 0 143 327
cannot 0 143 327
accept 0 143 327
this 0 143 327
Council 0 143 327
and 0 143 327
this 0 143 327
reform 0 143 327
and 0 143 327
this 0 143 327
orientation 0 143 327
even 0 143 327
though 0 143 327
it 0 143 327
comes 0 143 327
from 0 143 327
Rome. 0 143 327

From 0 143 328
Rome 0 143 328
we 0 143 328
expect 0 143 328
only 0 143 328
the 0 143 328
good. 0 143 328

We 0 143 329
do 0 143 329
not 0 143 329
expect 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
bad, 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
ill. 0 143 329
We 0 143 329
do 0 143 329
not 0 143 329
expect 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
abandonment 0 143 329
of 0 143 329
adoration 0 143 329
in 0 143 329
the 0 143 329
Mass. 0 143 329

We 0 143 330
need 0 143 330
this 0 143 330
adoration. 0 143 330

We 0 143 331
need 0 143 331
to 0 143 331
have 0 143 331
the 0 143 331
faith 0 143 331
in 0 143 331
the 0 143 331
divinity 0 143 331
of 0 143 331
Jesus 0 143 331
Christ. 0 143 331

Because 0 143 332
all 0 143 332
[of 0 143 332
this 0 143 332
change] 0 143 332
is 0 143 332
[oriented] 0 143 332
against 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
divinity 0 143 332
of 0 143 332
Jesus 0 143 332
Christ, 0 143 332
against 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
Kingdom 0 143 332
of 0 143 332
Jesus 0 143 332
Christ, 0 143 332
against 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
Real 0 143 332
Presence 0 143 332
of 0 143 332
Jesus 0 143 332
Christ 0 143 332
in 0 143 332
the 0 143 332
Mass. 0 143 332

It 0 143 333
is 0 143 333
a 0 143 333
sin 0 143 333
when 0 143 333
we 0 143 333
abandon 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
truth 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
Kingdom 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
Jesus 0 143 333
Christ, 0 143 333
everywhere, 0 143 333
and 0 143 333
we 0 143 333
abandon 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
Faith 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
the 0 143 333
divinity 0 143 333
of 0 143 333
Jesus 0 143 333
Christ. 0 143 333

He 0 143 334
is 0 143 334
King 0 143 334
because 0 143 334
he 0 143 334
is 0 143 334
God. 0 143 334

He 0 143 335
is 0 143 335
the 0 143 335
Son 0 143 335
of 0 143 335
God. 0 143 335

So, 0 143 336
He 0 143 336
is 0 143 336
King 0 143 336
by 0 143 336
His 0 143 336
nature. 0 143 336

This 0 143 337
is 0 143 337
essential. 0 143 337

Essential! 1 143 338

And 1 143 339
if 1 143 339
He 1 143 339
is 1 143 339
God, 1 143 339
we 1 143 339
must 1 143 339
give 1 143 339
Him 1 143 339
the 1 143 339
adoration 1 143 339
of 1 143 339
God. 1 143 339

And 0 143 340
so, 0 143 340
we 0 143 340
cannot 0 143 340
accept 0 143 340
the 0 143 340
diminution 0 143 340
of 0 143 340
this 0 143 340
Truth. 0 143 340

Jesus 0 143 341
Christ 0 143 341
is 0 143 341
the 0 143 341
Son 0 143 341
of 0 143 341
God. 0 143 341

Jesus 0 143 342
Christ 0 143 342
is 0 143 342
God. 0 143 342

That 0 143 343
is 0 143 343
a 0 143 343
fundamental 0 143 343
truth 0 143 343
of 0 143 343
our 0 143 343
Faith. 0 143 343

And 0 143 344
it 0 143 344
all 0 143 344
depends 0 143 344
on 0 143 344
this 0 143 344
Truth. 0 143 344

And 0 143 345
we 0 143 345
know 0 143 345
now 0 143 345
that 0 143 345
the 0 143 345
theologians 0 143 345
and 0 143 345
the 0 143 345
bishops 0 143 345
have 0 143 345
[a 0 143 345
new 0 143 345
orientation]. 0 143 345

They 0 143 346
do 0 143 346
not 0 143 346
express 0 143 346
this 0 143 346
truth 0 143 346
clearly 0 143 346
and 0 143 346
perfectly. 0 143 346

They 0 143 347
are 0 143 347
afraid 0 143 347
of 0 143 347
the 0 143 347
truth. 0 143 347

That 0 143 348
is 0 143 348
very 0 143 348
bad. 0 143 348

And 0 143 349
it 0 143 349
is 0 143 349
the 0 143 349
same 0 143 349
in 0 143 349
Rome. 0 143 349

I 0 143 350
think 0 143 350
they 0 143 350
refuse 0 143 350
[to 0 143 350
grant 0 143 350
me 0 143 350
an 0 143 350
audience 0 143 350
with] 0 143 350
the 0 143 350
pope, 0 143 350
[because 0 143 350
they 0 143 350
are 0 143 350
afraid 0 143 350
of 0 143 350
the 0 143 350
Truth]. 0 143 350

When 0 143 351
I 0 143 351
was 0 143 351
in 0 143 351
Rome 0 143 351
one 0 143 351
month 0 143 351
ago, 0 143 351
Mgr. 0 143 351

Benelli 0 143 352
told 0 143 352
me 0 143 352
he 0 143 352
visits 0 143 352
the 0 143 352
pope 0 143 352
every 0 143 352
day. 0 143 352

He 0 143 353
said 0 143 353
that 0 143 353
when 0 143 353
he 0 143 353
left 0 143 353
me, 0 143 353
he 0 143 353
would 0 143 353
go 0 143 353
immediately 0 143 353
to 0 143 353
the 0 143 353
pope 0 143 353
to 0 143 353
express 0 143 353
the 0 143 353
importance 0 143 353
of 0 143 353
the 0 143 353
work 0 143 353
we 0 143 353
had 0 143 353
conducted 0 143 353
during 0 143 353
our 0 143 353
meeting. 0 143 353

Immediately, 0 143 354
he 0 143 354
said, 0 143 354
he 0 143 354
would 0 143 354
be 0 143 354
going. 0 143 354

So, 0 143 355
why 0 143 355
do 0 143 355
they 0 143 355
not 0 143 355
grant 0 143 355
me 0 143 355
the 0 143 355
possibility 0 143 355
of 0 143 355
visiting 0 143 355
the 0 143 355
pope? 0 143 355

Because 0 143 356
they 0 143 356
are 0 143 356
afraid. 0 143 356

Meanwhile 0 143 357
the 0 143 357
Vatican 0 143 357
operated 0 143 357
a 0 143 357
veritable 0 143 357
swinging 0 143 357
door 0 143 357
where 0 143 357
actual 0 143 357
heretics 0 143 357
and 0 143 357
schismatics 0 143 357
were 0 143 357
concerned. 0 143 357

Here, 0 143 358
again, 0 143 358
is 0 143 358
Blessed 0 143 358
Paul 0 143 358
VI, 0 143 358
famously 0 143 358
meeting 0 143 358
for 0 143 358
the 0 143 358
first 0 143 358
time 0 143 358
ever 0 143 358
with 0 143 358
the 0 143 358
heretic 0 143 358
Archbishop 0 143 358
of 0 143 358
Canterbury 0 143 358
in 0 143 358
St. 0 143 358
Peter's: 0 143 358

Cardinal 0 143 359
Villot 0 143 359
said, 0 143 359
“We 0 143 359
are 0 143 359
afraid 0 143 359
if 0 143 359
Msgr. 0 143 359

Lefebvre 0 143 360
meets 0 143 360
and 0 143 360
speaks 0 143 360
with 0 143 360
the 0 143 360
pope 0 143 360
that 0 143 360
perhaps 0 143 360
the 0 143 360
pope 0 143 360
will 0 143 360
change 0 143 360
his 0 143 360
mind.” 0 143 360
Because 0 143 360
[the 0 143 360
pope] 0 143 360
is 0 143 360
not 0 143 360
too 0 143 360
sure; 0 143 360
the 1 143 360
pope 1 143 360
is 1 143 360
not 1 143 360
man 1 143 360
of 1 143 360
true 1 143 360
conviction. 1 143 360

He 0 143 361
is 0 143 361
a 0 143 361
mysterious 0 143 361
man. 0 143 361

We 0 143 362
cannot 0 143 362
give 0 143 362
a 0 143 362
definition 0 143 362
of 0 143 362
the 0 143 362
man. 0 143 362

He 0 143 363
expresses 0 143 363
the 0 143 363
truth, 0 143 363
and 0 143 363
then 0 143 363
he 0 143 363
does 0 143 363
the 0 143 363
contrary/opposite. 0 143 363

Some 0 143 364
part 0 143 364
of 0 143 364
him 0 143 364
will 0 143 364
speak 0 143 364
the 0 143 364
truth. 0 143 364

Another 0 143 365
part 0 143 365
of 0 143 365
him 0 143 365
is 0 143 365
open 0 143 365
to 0 143 365
error. 0 143 365

Very 0 143 366
curious. 0 143 366

And 0 143 367
they 0 143 367
are 0 143 367
afraid 0 143 367
that 0 143 367
if 0 143 367
I 0 143 367
reveal 0 143 367
the 0 143 367
truth 0 143 367
[and 0 143 367
tell 0 143 367
the 0 143 367
Pope] 0 143 367
“you 0 143 367
must 0 143 367
affirm 0 143 367
the 0 143 367
Kingdom 0 143 367
of 0 143 367
Jesus 0 143 367
Christ 0 143 367
everywhere 0 143 367
and 0 143 367
always 0 143 367
each 0 143 367
day. 0 143 367

You 0 143 368
must 0 143 368
affirm 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Real 0 143 368
Presence 0 143 368
in 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Mass 0 143 368
- 0 143 368
in 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Sacrifice 0 143 368
of 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Mass,” 0 143 368
then 0 143 368
perhaps 0 143 368
it 0 143 368
is 0 143 368
possible 0 143 368
that 0 143 368
the 0 143 368
Pope 0 143 368
will 0 143 368
change 0 143 368
his 0 143 368
mind. 0 143 368

And 0 143 369
so, 0 143 369
Cardinal 0 143 369
Villot 0 143 369
says, 0 143 369
there 0 143 369
is 0 143 369
a 0 143 369
confusion, 0 143 369
and 0 143 369
they 0 143 369
do 0 143 369
not 0 143 369
want 0 143 369
me 0 143 369
to 0 143 369
visit 0 143 369
the 0 143 369
pope. 0 143 369

It 0 143 370
is 0 143 370
impossible 0 143 370
to 0 143 370
admit 0 143 370
me. 0 143 370

And 0 143 371
I 0 143 371
know 0 143 371
the 0 143 371
pope 0 143 371
very 0 143 371
well! 0 143 371

When 0 143 372
I 0 143 372
was 0 143 372
the 0 143 372
apostolic 0 143 372
delegate 0 143 372
to 0 143 372
Pius 0 143 372
XII, 0 143 372
I 0 143 372
was 0 143 372
going 0 143 372
to 0 143 372
Rome 0 143 372
every 0 143 372
year. 0 143 372

And 0 143 373
during 0 143 373
those 0 143 373
eleven 0 143 373
years, 0 143 373
I 0 143 373
met 0 143 373
Msgr. 0 143 373

Montini. 0 143 374

I 1 143 375
know 1 143 375
him 1 143 375
very 1 143 375
well. 1 143 375

He 0 143 376
received 0 143 376
me 0 143 376
twice 0 143 376
during 0 143 376
the 0 143 376
Council, 0 143 376
for 0 143 376
a 0 143 376
private 0 143 376
audience 0 143 376
with 0 143 376
the 0 143 376
pope. 0 143 376

But, 0 143 377
now, 0 143 377
with 0 143 377
my 0 143 377
position 0 143 377
against 0 143 377
the 0 143 377
Council 0 143 377
and 0 143 377
the 0 143 377
reforms, 0 143 377
he 0 143 377
says: 0 143 377
“No, 0 143 377
impossible! 0 143 377

You 0 143 378
must 0 143 378
sign 0 143 378
in 0 143 378
writing 0 143 378
that 0 143 378
you 0 143 378
[accept] 0 143 378
the 0 143 378
Council 0 143 378
and 0 143 378
all 0 143 378
the 0 143 378
reforms 0 143 378
before 0 143 378
I 0 143 378
will 0 143 378
receive 0 143 378
you 0 143 378
in 0 143 378
audience.” 0 143 378
But 0 143 378
I 0 143 378
cannot 0 143 378
do 0 143 378
that. 0 143 378

For 0 143 379
me, 0 143 379
if 1 143 379
I 1 143 379
do 1 143 379
that, 1 143 379
then 1 143 379
I 1 143 379
betray 1 143 379
my 1 143 379
mother, 1 143 379
the 1 143 379
Church. 1 143 379

The 1 143 380
Church! 1 143 380

So, 0 143 381
I 0 143 381
thank 0 143 381
you 0 143 381
very 0 143 381
much 0 143 381
for 0 143 381
your 0 143 381
encouragement, 0 143 381
and 0 143 381
I 0 143 381
must 0 143 381
say 0 143 381
that 0 143 381
we 0 143 381
have 0 143 381
a 0 143 381
very 0 143 381
good 0 143 381
generation 0 143 381
of 0 143 381
young 0 143 381
men 0 143 381
and 0 143 381
good 0 143 381
vocations. 0 143 381

For 0 143 382
the 0 143 382
coming 0 143 382
year 0 143 382
we 0 143 382
have 0 143 382
59 0 143 382
applications 0 143 382
to 0 143 382
our 0 143 382
seminary 0 143 382
in 0 143 382
Econe, 0 143 382
Switzerland 0 143 382
– 0 143 382
applications 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
the 0 143 382
United 0 143 382
States, 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
England, 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
Germany, 0 143 382
from 0 143 382
France, 0 143 382
and 0 143 382
Spain. 0 143 382

Good 0 143 383
young 0 143 383
men 0 143 383
with 0 143 383
good 0 143 383
dispositions 0 143 383
are 0 143 383
coming 0 143 383
from 0 143 383
everywhere. 0 143 383

And 0 143 384
why? 0 143 384

Why 0 143 385
do 0 143 385
they 0 143 385
come 0 143 385
to 0 143 385
this 0 143 385
seminary 0 143 385
when 0 143 385
they 0 143 385
know 0 143 385
we 0 143 385
are 0 143 385
in 0 143 385
difficulties 0 143 385
with 0 143 385
Rome? 0 143 385

They 0 143 386
know 0 143 386
that. 0 143 386

But 0 143 387
still 0 143 387
they 0 143 387
come. 0 143 387

I 0 143 388
ask 0 143 388
them, 0 143 388
why 0 143 388
do 0 143 388
you 0 143 388
come 0 143 388
to 0 143 388
Econe? 0 143 388

You 0 143 389
know 0 143 389
our 0 143 389
situation. 0 143 389

They 0 143 390
say, 0 143 390
“Yes, 0 143 390
we 0 143 390
know 0 143 390
your 0 143 390
situation, 0 143 390
but 0 143 390
we 0 143 390
want 0 143 390
to 0 143 390
become 0 143 390
true 0 143 390
priests 0 143 390
and 0 143 390
not 0 143 390
protestant 0 143 390
pastors 0 143 390
or 0 143 390
modernist 0 143 390
priests. 0 143 390

We 0 143 391
are 0 143 391
coming 0 143 391
to 0 143 391
your 0 143 391
seminary 0 143 391
because 0 143 391
we 0 143 391
know 0 143 391
that 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
end 0 143 391
of 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
priest 0 143 391
is 0 143 391
to 0 143 391
offer 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
true 0 143 391
Sacrifice 0 143 391
of 0 143 391
the 0 143 391
Mass. 0 143 391

And 0 143 392
so, 0 143 392
we 0 143 392
are 0 143 392
Coming 0 143 392
to 0 143 392
Econe.” 0 143 392

And 0 143 393
as 0 143 393
I 0 143 393
have 0 143 393
visited 0 143 393
my 0 143 393
seminary 0 143 393
here 0 143 393
in 0 143 393
Armada 0 143 393
for 0 143 393
the 0 143 393
past 0 143 393
five 0 143 393
days, 0 143 393
I 0 143 393
can 0 143 393
see 0 143 393
it 0 143 393
is 0 143 393
the 0 143 393
same 0 143 393
here. 0 143 393

We 0 143 394
have 0 143 394
very 0 143 394
good 0 143 394
young 0 143 394
men. 0 143 394

I 0 143 395
also 0 143 395
have 0 143 395
some 0 143 395
Americans 0 143 395
in 0 143 395
my 0 143 395
seminary 0 143 395
in 0 143 395
Econe. 0 143 395

In 0 143 396
six 0 143 396
weeks 0 143 396
I 0 143 396
will 0 143 396
ordain 0 143 396
one 0 143 396
American 0 143 396
priest 0 143 396
from 0 143 396
Detroit, 0 143 396
who 0 143 396
is 0 143 396
a 0 143 396
very 0 143 396
good 0 143 396
seminarian 0 143 396
and 0 143 396
will 0 143 396
be 0 143 396
a 0 143 396
good 0 143 396
priest. 0 143 396

But 0 143 397
these 0 143 397
young 0 143 397
men 0 143 397
refuse 0 143 397
to 0 143 397
become 0 143 397
protestants. 0 143 397

They 0 143 398
refuse 0 143 398
to 0 143 398
become 0 143 398
modernist. 0 143 398

They 0 143 399
ask 0 143 399
to 0 143 399
become 0 143 399
true 0 143 399
priests. 0 143 399

And 0 143 400
it 0 143 400
is 0 143 400
a 0 143 400
pity 0 143 400
there 0 143 400
are 0 143 400
not 0 143 400
100 0 143 400
bishops 0 143 400
opening 0 143 400
good 0 143 400
seminaries. 0 143 400

So, 0 143 401
I 0 143 401
ask 0 143 401
you 0 143 401
to 0 143 401
pray 0 143 401
for 0 143 401
these 0 143 401
seminarians 0 143 401
because 0 143 401
when 0 143 401
they 0 143 401
become 0 143 401
priests 0 143 401
they 0 143 401
will 0 143 401
have 0 143 401
many 0 143 401
worries 0 143 401
and 0 143 401
many 0 143 401
difficulties. 0 143 401

I 0 143 402
think, 0 143 402
however, 0 143 402
they 0 143 402
are 0 143 402
very 0 143 402
well 0 143 402
prepared 0 143 402
to 0 143 402
deal 0 143 402
with 0 143 402
these 0 143 402
difficulties 0 143 402
and 0 143 402
worries. 0 143 402

And 0 143 403
we 0 143 403
have 0 143 403
confidence 0 143 403
in 0 143 403
God. 0 143 403

Since 0 143 404
I 0 143 404
began 0 143 404
this 0 143 404
work 0 143 404
six 0 143 404
years 0 143 404
ago, 0 143 404
now, 0 143 404
I 0 143 404
have 0 143 404
evidence 0 143 404
that 0 143 404
God 0 143 404
is 0 143 404
assisting 0 143 404
us. 0 143 404

Because 0 143 405
it 0 143 405
is 0 143 405
impossible, 0 143 405
I 0 143 405
realize, 0 143 405
to 0 143 405
do 0 143 405
this 0 143 405
by 0 143 405
myself. 0 143 405

We 0 143 406
now 0 143 406
have 0 143 406
houses 0 143 406
in 0 143 406
Switzerland 0 143 406

England, 0 143 406

and 0 143 406
New 0 143 406
York. 0 143 406

In 0 143 407
Albano, 0 143 407
near 0 143 407
Rome, 0 143 407
we 0 143 407
have 0 143 407
a 0 143 407
congregation 0 143 407
of 0 143 407
sisters 0 143 407
where 0 143 407
I 0 143 407
have 0 143 407
five 0 143 407
vocations 0 143 407
from 0 143 407
the 0 143 407
states 0 143 407
(good 0 143 407
sisters). 0 143 407

And 0 143 408
I 0 143 408
am 0 143 408
building 0 143 408
a 0 143 408
seminary 0 143 408
in 0 143 408
Switzerland. 0 143 408

It 1 143 409
is 1 143 409
impossible 1 143 409
to 1 143 409
do 1 143 409
all 1 143 409
this 1 143 409
without 1 143 409
God’s 1 143 409
assistance. 1 143 409

So, 0 143 410
I 0 143 410
have 0 143 410
confidence. 0 143 410

It 0 143 411
is 0 143 411
impossible 0 143 411
for 0 143 411
the 0 143 411
Church 0 143 411
to 0 143 411
change 0 143 411
its 0 143 411
tradition. 0 143 411

The 0 143 412
tradition 0 143 412
of 0 143 412
twenty 0 143 412
centuries. 0 143 412

That 1 143 413
we 1 143 413
cannot 1 143 413
change. 1 143 413

The 0 143 414
Church 0 143 414
is 0 143 414
tradition. 0 143 414

The 1 143 415
Church 1 143 415
is 1 143 415
tradition. 1 143 415

It 0 143 416
is 0 143 416
not 0 143 416
revolution. 0 143 416

I 1 143 417
thank 1 143 417
you 1 143 417
for 1 143 417

His 0 67 30

Hey, 0 149 1
remember 0 149 1
five 0 149 1
minutes 0 149 1
ago 0 149 1
when 0 149 1
Pope 0 149 1
Francis 0 149 1
shouted 0 149 1
at 0 149 1
a 0 149 1
reporter 0 149 1
in 0 149 1
Chile 0 149 1
that 0 149 1
there 0 149 1
was 0 149 1
“no 0 149 1

supporting 0 149 1
complaints 0 149 1

his 1 149 1
good 1 149 1
friend 1 149 1
Bishop 1 149 1
Juan 1 149 1
Barros? 1 149 1

And, 0 149 2
just 0 149 2
for 0 149 2
good 0 149 2
measure 0 149 2
he 0 149 2
accused 0 149 2
the 0 149 2
people 0 149 2
accusing 0 149 2
him 0 149 2
– 0 149 2
victims 0 149 2
of 0 149 2
sexual 0 149 2

by 0 149 2

the 1 149 2
convicted 1 149 2

– 0 149 2
of 0 149 2
committing 0 149 2
“calumny”? 1 149 2

[1] 0 149 3
And 0 149 3
remember 0 149 3
when 0 149 3
Cardinal 0 149 3
O’Malley 0 149 3
told 0 149 3
the 0 149 3
pope 0 149 3
off 0 149 3
in 0 149 3
public 0 149 3
over 0 149 3
the 0 149 3
“pain” 1 149 3
these 0 149 3
accusations 0 149 3
had 0 149 3
caused 0 149 3
the 0 149 3
victims 0 149 3
of 0 149 3
sexual 0 149 3
abuse? 0 149 3

And 0 149 4
then 0 149 4
remember 0 149 4
how 0 149 4
the 0 149 4
pope 0 149 4
had 1 149 4
apologised-except-not-really 1 149 4
because 0 149 4
the 1 149 4
accusations 1 149 4
are, 1 149 4
after 1 149 4
all, 1 149 4
still 1 149 4
lies, 1 149 4
and 1 149 4
that 1 149 4
there’s 1 149 4
still 1 149 4
“no 1 149 4
evidence” 1 149 4
against 1 149 4
Barros…? 1 149 4

full 0 149 5
this 0 149 5
week 0 149 5
of 0 149 5
the 0 149 5
story 0 149 5
that 0 149 5
the 0 149 5

indeed 0 149 5

– 0 149 5
not 0 149 5
only 0 149 5
that 0 149 5
Barros 0 149 5
had 0 149 5
helped 0 149 5
to 0 149 5
cover 0 149 5
it 0 149 5
up 0 149 5
but 0 149 5
that 0 149 5
he 0 149 5
had 0 149 5
been 0 149 5
present 0 149 5
and 0 149 5
a 0 149 5

from 0 149 6
the 0 149 6

whom 0 149 6

Pope 0 149 7
Francis 0 149 7

a 0 149 7
victim’s 0 149 7
letter 0 149 7
in 0 149 7
2015 0 149 7
that 0 149 7
graphically 0 149 7
detailed 0 149 7
how 0 149 7
a 0 149 7
priest 0 149 7
sexually 0 149 7
abused 0 149 7
him 0 149 7
and 0 149 7
how 0 149 7
other 0 149 7
Chilean 0 149 7
clergy 0 149 7
ignored 0 149 7
it, 0 149 7
contradicting 0 149 7
the 0 149 7
pope’s 0 149 7
recent 0 149 7
insistence 0 149 7
that 0 149 7
no 0 149 7
victims 0 149 7
had 0 149 7
come 0 149 7
forward 0 149 7
to 0 149 7
denounce 0 149 7
the 0 149 7
cover-up, 0 149 7
the 0 149 7
letter’s 0 149 7
author 0 149 7
and 0 149 7
members 0 149 7
of 0 149 7

told 0 149 7
The 0 149 7

The 0 149 8
fact 0 149 8
that 0 149 8
Francis 0 149 8
received 0 149 8
the 0 149 8
eight-page 0 149 8
letter, 0 149 8
obtained 0 149 8
by 0 149 8
the 0 149 8
AP, 0 149 8
challenges 0 149 8
his 0 149 8
insistence 0 149 8
that 0 149 8
he 0 149 8
has 0 149 8
“zero 0 149 8
tolerance” 0 149 8
for 0 149 8
sex 0 149 8
abuse 0 149 8
and 0 149 8
cover-ups. 0 149 8

It 1 149 9
also 1 149 9
calls 1 149 9
into 1 149 9
question 1 149 9
his 1 149 9
stated 1 149 9
empathy 1 149 9
with 1 149 9

of 0 149 9
his 0 149 9
five-year 0 149 9
papacy. 0 149 9

Now 0 149 10
it 0 149 10
appears 0 149 10
that 0 149 10
Francis 0 149 10

a 0 149 11

that 0 149 11
the 0 149 11

under 0 149 11

“had 0 149 11

that 0 149 16
the 0 149 16

after 0 149 17
several 0 149 17

and 0 149 17
three 0 149 17
months 0 149 17
later[2], 0 149 17
Muller 0 149 17
was 0 149 17
able 0 149 17
to 0 149 17
get 0 149 17
an 0 149 17
audience 0 149 17
with 0 149 17

“I 0 149 17
am 1 149 17

Marco 0 149 19
Tosatti 0 149 19
reports 0 149 19
the 0 149 19
CDF 0 149 19
incident, 0 149 19
but 0 149 19
it 0 149 19
follows 0 149 19
an 0 149 19
odd 0 149 19
story 0 149 19
of 0 149 19
a 0 149 19
meeting 0 149 19
of 0 149 19
curial 0 149 19
officials 0 149 19
to 0 149 19
discuss 0 149 19
certain 0 149 19
bishop 0 149 19
appointments. 0 149 19

Without 0 149 20
naming 0 149 20
names, 0 149 20
(or, 0 149 20
frustratingly, 0 149 20
giving 0 149 20
dates[3]) 0 149 20
Tosatti 0 149 20
relates: 0 149 20

“It 0 149 21
was 0 149 21
some 0 149 21
time 0 149 21
ago 0 149 21
to 0 149 21
make 0 149 21
a 0 149 21
bishop, 0 149 21
not 0 149 21
in 0 149 21
Italy. 0 149 21

The 0 149 22
nuncio 0 149 22
has 0 149 22
prepared 0 149 22
the 0 149 22
triad 0 149 22
[the 0 149 22
“terna” 0 149 22
or 0 149 22
list 0 149 22
of 0 149 22
three 0 149 22
candidates]. 0 149 22

A 0 149 23
cardinal, 0 149 23
head 0 149 23
of 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
dicastery, 0 149 23
perhaps 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
same 0 149 23
holder 0 149 23
of 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
Congregation 0 149 23
for 0 149 23
Bishops, 0 149 23
during 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
ordinary 0 149 23
assembly 0 149 23
took 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
floor, 0 149 23
saying: 0 149 23
‘The 0 149 23
first 0 149 23
candidate 0 149 23
indicated 0 149 23
is 0 149 23
excellent, 0 149 23
the 0 149 23
second 0 149 23
is 0 149 23
good. 0 149 23

But 0 149 24
I 0 149 24
would 0 149 24
like 0 149 24
to 0 149 24
warn 0 149 24
of 0 149 24
the 0 149 24
third, 0 149 24
whom 0 149 24
I 0 149 24
know 0 149 24
well, 0 149 24
since 0 149 24
he 0 149 24
was 0 149 24
a 0 149 24
seminarian, 0 149 24
and 0 149 24
who 0 149 24
presents 0 149 24
problems 0 149 24
both 0 149 24
on 0 149 24
the 0 149 24
level 0 149 24
of 0 149 24
doctrine 0 149 24
and 0 149 24
morality. 0 149 24

He 0 149 25
responds 0 149 25
little 0 149 25
to 0 149 25
the 0 149 25
necessary 0 149 25
criteria. 0 149 25

But 0 149 26
the 0 149 26
third 0 149 26
was 0 149 26
a 0 149 26
friend 0 149 26
of 0 149 26
someone 0 149 26
and 0 149 26
another 0 149 26
cardinal, 0 149 26
of 0 149 26
the 0 149 26
circle 0 149 26
currently 0 149 26
in 0 149 26
power, 0 149 26
has 0 149 26
flung 0 149 26
himself 0 149 26
at 0 149 26
his 0 149 26
colleague, 0 149 26
accusing 0 149 26
him 0 149 26
of 0 149 26
impropriety.’ 0 149 26
The 0 149 26
meeting 0 149 26
ended 0 149 26
without 0 149 26
further 0 149 26
decisions.” 0 149 26

Whatever 0 149 27
the 0 149 27
details 0 149 27
of 0 149 27
these 0 149 27
strange 0 149 27
incidents, 0 149 27
what 0 149 27
is 0 149 27
clear 0 149 27
in 0 149 27
Chile 0 149 27
is 0 149 27
that 0 149 27
no 0 149 27
amount 0 149 27
of 0 149 27
eyewitness 0 149 27
testimony 0 149 27
was 0 149 27
going 0 149 27
to 0 149 27
make 0 149 27
the 0 149 27
slightest 0 149 27
difference. 0 149 27

Bergoglio 0 149 28
wanted 0 149 28
Barros 0 149 28
as 0 149 28
a 0 149 28
bishop 0 149 28
and 0 149 28
that 0 149 28
was 0 149 28
that. 0 149 28

Even 0 149 29
while 0 149 29
“apologising” 0 149 29
the 0 149 29
pope 0 149 29
had 0 149 29
doubled 0 149 29
down 0 149 29
when 0 149 29
questioned 0 149 29
about 0 149 29
it 0 149 29
by 0 149 29
journalists, 0 149 29
saying, 0 149 29
“You, 0 149 29
in 0 149 29
all 0 149 29
good 0 149 29
will, 0 149 29
tell 0 149 29
me 0 149 29
that 0 149 29
there 0 149 29
are 0 149 29
victims, 0 149 29
but 0 149 29
I 0 149 29
haven’t 0 149 29
seen 0 149 29
any, 0 149 29
because 0 149 29
they 0 149 29
haven’t 0 149 29
come 0 149 29
forward.” 0 149 29

“In 0 149 30
the 0 149 30
case 0 149 30
of 0 149 30
Barros 0 149 30
it’s 0 149 30
been 0 149 30
observed, 0 149 30
it’s 0 149 30
been 0 149 30
studied; 0 149 30
there’s 0 149 30
no 0 149 30
evidence. 0 149 30

The 0 149 31
best 0 149 31
thing 0 149 31
to 0 149 31
do 0 149 31
if 0 149 31
someone 0 149 31
believes 0 149 31
it’s 0 149 31
the 0 149 31
case 0 149 31

to 0 149 31
come 0 149 31

evidence.” 0 149 31

The 0 149 32
AP 0 149 32
report, 0 149 32
however, 0 149 32
says 0 149 32
exactly 0 149 32
the 0 149 32
opposite; 0 149 32
that 0 149 32

and 0 149 33
Commission 0 149 33
member 0 149 33
who 0 149 33
resigned, 0 149 33
citing 0 149 33
the 0 149 33
Vatican’s 0 149 33
refusal 0 149 33
to 0 149 33
take 0 149 33
meaningful 0 149 33
action, 0 149 33
told 0 149 33
AP, 0 149 33
“When 0 149 33
we 0 149 33
gave 0 149 33
him 0 149 33

on 0 149 34
the 0 149 34
Commission 0 149 34
the 0 149 34
Vatican 0 149 34
had 0 149 34
blocked, 0 149 34
told 0 149 34
AP, 0 149 34
“Cardinal 0 149 34

that 0 149 34

pope 0 149 34
– 0 149 34
in 1 149 34
his 1 149 34
hands.” 1 149 34

On 0 149 35
the 0 149 35
face 0 149 35
of 0 149 35
it, 0 149 35
there 0 149 35
are 0 149 35
only 0 149 35
a 0 149 35
few 0 149 35
logical 0 149 35
possibilities 0 149 35
here. 0 149 35

In 0 149 36
fact, 0 149 36
unless 0 149 36
Cardinal 0 149 36
O’Malley 0 149 36
– 0 149 36
who 0 149 36
has, 0 149 36
as 0 149 36
of 0 149 36
this 0 149 36
writing, 0 149 36
remained 0 149 36
silent 0 149 36
– 0 149 36
comes 0 149 36
forward 0 149 36
and 0 149 36
says 0 149 36
that 0 149 36
he 0 149 36
didn’t 0 149 36
hand 0 149 36
the 0 149 36
letter 0 149 36
over 0 149 36
pope, 0 149 36
there 0 149 36
is 0 149 36
really 0 149 36
only 0 149 36
one; 0 149 36
that 0 149 36
the 0 149 36
pope 0 149 36
lied. 0 149 36

And 0 149 37
this 0 149 37
is 0 149 37
what 0 149 37
is 0 149 37
now 0 149 37
being 0 149 37
said 0 149 37
quite 0 149 37
openly 0 149 37
by 0 149 37
a 0 149 37
vast 0 149 37
array 0 149 37

left 0 149 37
and 0 149 37
right. 0 149 37

As 0 149 38
Winfield 0 149 38
writes, 0 149 38

“The 0 149 39
revelation 0 149 39
could 0 149 39
be 0 149 39
costly 0 149 39

record 0 149 39
on 0 149 39
the 0 149 39
abuse 0 149 39
crisis 0 149 39
was 0 149 39
already 0 149 39
shaky 0 149 39
after 0 149 39
a 0 149 39
botched 0 149 39
Italian 0 149 39

at 0 149 40
the 0 149 40
end 0 149 40
of 0 149 40
last 0 149 40
year. 0 149 40

Vatican 0 149 41
analysts 0 149 41
now 0 149 41
openly 0 149 41
question 0 149 41
whether 0 149 41
he 0 149 41
‘gets 0 149 41
it,’ 0 149 41
and 0 149 41
some 0 149 41
of 0 149 41
his 0 149 41
own 0 149 41
advisers 0 149 41

acknowledge 0 149 41
that 0 149 41

he 0 149 41
doesn’t.” 0 149 41

“No 0 149 42
evidence…” 0 149 42
Lie 1 149 42
big, 1 149 42
lie 1 149 42
often, 1 149 42
and 1 149 42
when 1 149 42
caught, 1 149 42
keep 1 149 42
lying. 1 149 42

One 0 149 43
of 0 149 43
the 0 149 43
many 0 149 43
things 0 149 43
these 0 149 43
secular 1 149 43
reporters 1 149 43

be 0 149 43
paying 0 149 43
attention 0 149 43
to 0 149 43
is 0 149 43
that 0 149 43
“no 0 149 43

is 0 149 43
in 0 149 43
fact 0 149 43
a 0 149 43
well-rehearsed, 0 149 43
stock 0 149 43
response 0 149 43
for 0 149 43
Bergoglio. 0 149 43

He 0 149 44
said 0 149 44
almost 0 149 44
exactly 0 149 44
the 0 149 44
same 0 149 44
in 0 149 44
2013 0 149 44
when 0 149 44
confronted 0 149 44
about 0 149 44
another 0 149 44
predatory 1 149 44
homosexual 1 149 44
he 0 149 44
was 0 149 44
sheltering. 0 149 44

The 0 149 45
hoopla 0 149 45
surrounding 0 149 45
the 0 149 45
“Who 1 149 45
am 1 149 45
I 1 149 45
to 1 149 45
judge” 1 149 45
comment 0 149 45
tends 0 149 45
to 0 149 45
obscure 0 149 45
the 0 149 45
context 0 149 45
of 0 149 45
the 0 149 45
comment. 0 149 45

It 0 149 46
was 0 149 46
made 0 149 46
in 0 149 46
response 0 149 46
to 0 149 46
a 0 149 46
question 0 149 46
by 0 149 46
a 0 149 46
journalist 0 149 46
about 0 149 46
Monsignore 0 149 46
Battista 0 149 46
Ricca 0 149 46
– 0 149 46
a 0 149 46
prelate 0 149 46
whose 0 149 46
promiscuous 0 149 46
homosexuality 0 149 46
is 0 149 46
so 0 149 46
well 0 149 46
known 0 149 46
it 0 149 46
was 0 149 46
covered 0 149 46
by 0 149 46
the 0 149 46
Telegraph 0 149 46
as 0 149 46
early 0 149 46
as 0 149 46
July 0 149 46
2013. 0 149 46

Ilze 0 149 47
Scamparini 0 149 47
asked 0 149 47
the 0 149 47
pope 0 149 47
about 0 149 47
Ricca, 0 149 47
saying, 0 149 47
“What 0 149 47
you 0 149 47
intend 0 149 47
to 0 149 47
do 0 149 47
about 0 149 47
this? 0 149 47

How 0 149 48
are 0 149 48
you 0 149 48
confronting 0 149 48
this 0 149 48
issue 0 149 48
and 0 149 48
how 0 149 48
does 0 149 48
Your 0 149 48
Holiness 0 149 48
intend 0 149 48
to 0 149 48
confront 0 149 48
the 0 149 48
whole 0 149 48
question 0 149 48
of 0 149 48
the 0 149 48
gay 0 149 48
lobby?” 0 149 48

What 0 149 49
reply 0 149 49
did 0 149 49
Bergoglio 0 149 49
give? 0 149 49

His 0 149 50
standard 0 149 50
one: 0 149 50
“No 1 149 50
evidence.” 1 149 50

About 0 149 51
Monsignor 0 149 51
Ricca: 0 149 51
I 0 149 51
did 0 149 51
what 0 149 51
canon 0 149 51
law 0 149 51
calls 0 149 51
for, 0 149 51
that 0 149 51
is 0 149 51
a 0 149 51
preliminary 0 149 51
investigation. 0 149 51

And 0 149 52
from 0 149 52
this 0 149 52
investigation, 0 149 52
there 0 149 52
was 0 149 52
nothing 0 149 52
of 0 149 52
what 0 149 52
had 0 149 52
been 0 149 52
alleged. 0 149 52

We 0 149 53
did 0 149 53
not 0 149 53
find 0 149 53
anything 0 149 53
of 0 149 53
that. 0 149 53

This 0 149 54
is 0 149 54
the 0 149 54
response.” 0 149 54

He 0 149 55
added, 0 149 55
“In 0 149 55
this 0 149 55
case, 0 149 55
I 0 149 55
conducted 0 149 55
the 0 149 55
preliminary 0 149 55
investigation 0 149 55
and 0 149 55
we 0 149 55
didn’t 0 149 55
find 0 149 55
anything.” 0 149 55

But 0 149 56
Ricca’s 0 149 56
activities, 0 149 56
for 0 149 56
which 0 149 56
the 0 149 56
pope 0 149 56
claimed 0 149 56
there 0 149 56
was 0 149 56
no 0 149 56
evidence, 0 149 56
were 0 149 56
notorious. 0 149 56

They 0 149 57
include 0 149 57
being 0 149 57
caught 0 149 57
in 0 149 57
flagrante 0 149 57
in 0 149 57
an 0 149 57
elevator 0 149 57
with 0 149 57
a 0 149 57
teenaged 0 149 57
male 0 149 57
prostitute, 0 149 57
and 0 149 57
his 0 149 57
sexual 0 149 57
relationship 0 149 57
with 0 149 57
a 0 149 57
captain 0 149 57
in 0 149 57
the 0 149 57
Swiss 0 149 57
army. 0 149 57

So 0 149 58
flagrant 1 149 58
was 0 149 58
Ricca’s 0 149 58
behaviour 0 149 58
that 0 149 58
it 0 149 58
took 0 149 58
intervention 0 149 58
by 0 149 58
Uruguay’s 0 149 58
nuncio 0 149 58
to 0 149 58
have 0 149 58
him 0 149 58
removed. 0 149 58

It 0 149 59
was 0 149 59
reported 0 149 59
in 0 149 59
1999 0 149 59
and 0 149 59
2000 0 149 59
by 0 149 59
L’Espresso, 0 149 59
who 0 149 59
said 0 149 59
the 0 149 59
information 0 149 59
was 0 149 59
confirmed 0 149 59
by 0 149 59
“numerous 0 149 59
bishops, 0 149 59
priests, 0 149 59
religious 0 149 59
and 0 149 59
laity” 0 149 59
in 0 149 59
Uruguay[6]. 0 149 59

In 0 149 60
fact, 0 149 60
the 0 149 60
evidence 0 149 60
shows 0 149 60
that 0 149 60
Ricca 0 149 60
is 0 149 60
completely 0 149 60
in 0 149 60
line 0 149 60
with 0 149 60
Bergoglio’s 0 149 60
normal 0 149 60
procedures. 0 149 60

As 0 149 61
“Marcantonio 0 149 61
Colonna” 0 149 61
wrote 0 149 61
in 0 149 61
the 0 149 61
Dictator 0 149 61
Pope, 0 149 61
“In 0 149 61
fact 0 149 61
his 0 149 61
patronage 0 149 61
of 0 149 61
Monsignor 0 149 61
Ricca 0 149 61
fits 0 149 61
the 0 149 61
pattern 0 149 61
which 0 149 61
was 0 149 61
well 0 149 61
established 0 149 61
when 0 149 61
he 0 149 61
was 0 149 61
Archbishop 0 149 61
of 0 149 61
Buenos 0 149 61
Aires, 0 149 61
whereby 0 149 61
he 0 149 61
surrounds 0 149 61
himself 0 149 61
with 0 149 61
morally 0 149 61
weak 0 149 61
people 0 149 61
so 0 149 61
as 0 149 61
to 0 149 61
have 0 149 61
them 0 149 61
under 1 149 61
his 1 149 61
thumb.” 1 149 61

It 0 149 62
was 0 149 62
at 0 149 62
this 0 149 62
early 0 149 62
“no 0 149 62
evidence” 0 149 62
comment 0 149 62
on 0 149 62
the 0 149 62
plane 0 149 62
home 0 149 62
from 0 149 62
Rio 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
some 0 149 62
of 0 149 62
those 0 149 62
paying 0 149 62
attention 0 149 62
started 0 149 62
to 0 149 62
understand 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
Bergoglio’s 0 149 62
policy 0 149 62
is 0 149 62
in 0 149 62
line 0 149 62
with 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
of 0 149 62
certain 0 149 62
leaders 0 149 62
of 0 149 62
the 0 149 62
past 0 149 62
who 0 149 62
recommended 0 149 62
that 0 149 62
if 0 149 62
a 0 149 62
politician 0 149 62
was 0 149 62
going 0 149 62
to 0 149 62
lie, 0 149 62
he 0 149 62
should 0 149 62
lie 1 149 62
big 1 149 62
and 1 149 62
lie 1 149 62
brazenly. 1 149 62

And 0 149 63
in 0 149 63
case 0 149 63
anyone 0 149 63
was 0 149 63
wondering 0 149 63
what 0 149 63
will 0 149 63
happen 0 149 63
next, 0 149 63
the 0 149 63
same 0 149 63
advice 0 149 63
said 0 149 63
to 0 149 63
keep 0 149 63
on 0 149 63
lying 0 149 63
after 0 149 63
you’re 0 149 63
caught. 0 149 63

The 0 149 64
pattern 0 149 64
of 0 149 64
silence 0 149 64
and, 0 149 64
when 0 149 64
pressed, 0 149 64
flat-out 0 149 64
denial 0 149 64
has 0 149 64
been 0 149 64
Bergoglio’s 0 149 64
policy 0 149 64
since 0 149 64
long 0 149 64
before 0 149 64
he 0 149 64
came 0 149 64
on 0 149 64
the 0 149 64
international 0 149 64
scene. 0 149 64

He 0 149 65
has 0 149 65
a 0 149 65
long 0 149 65
record 0 149 65
in 0 149 65
Argentina 0 149 65
of 0 149 65
shaving 0 149 65
close 0 149 65
to 0 149 65
scandals 0 149 65
and 0 149 65
vociferously 0 149 65
denying 0 149 65
involvement, 0 149 65
and 0 149 65
relying 0 149 65
heavily 0 149 65
on 0 149 65
the 0 149 65
broad 0 149 65
good 0 149 65
will 0 149 65
of 0 149 65
Catholics 0 149 65
towards 0 149 65
bishops 0 149 65
to 0 149 65
pull 0 149 65
it 0 149 65
off. 0 149 65

Perhaps 0 149 66
his 0 149 66
biggest 0 149 66
error 0 149 66
with 0 149 66
Barros 0 149 66
was 0 149 66
failing 0 149 66
to 0 149 66
understand 0 149 66
just 0 149 66
how 0 149 66
little 0 149 66
of 0 149 66
that 0 149 66
capital 0 149 66
of 0 149 66
trust 0 149 66
there 0 149 66
is 0 149 66
left 0 149 66
in 0 149 66
the 0 149 66
Catholic 0 149 66
world 0 149 66
as 0 149 66
a 0 149 66
whole. 0 149 66

Indeed, 0 149 67
on 0 149 67
the 0 149 67
subject 0 149 67
of 0 149 67
priests 0 149 67
sexually 0 149 67
abusing 0 149 67
young 0 149 67
people, 0 149 67
it 0 149 67
could 0 149 67
only 0 149 67
be 0 149 67
measured 0 149 67
in 0 149 67
the 0 149 67
negative 0 149 67
numbers. 0 149 67

“Argentine 0 149 68

Though 0 149 69
the 0 149 69
website 0 149 69

their 0 149 69
data 0 149 69
is 0 149 69
unassailable 0 149 69
since 0 149 69
most 0 149 69
of 0 149 69
it 0 149 69
comes 0 149 69
from 0 149 69
information 0 149 69
that 0 149 69
is 0 149 69
already 0 149 69
public. 0 149 69

On 0 149 70
their 0 149 70
Argentina 0 149 70
page 0 149 70
is 0 149 70
a 0 149 70
long 0 149 70
list 0 149 70
of 0 149 70
accusations 0 149 70
that 0 149 70
Bergoglio/Francis 0 149 70
simply 0 149 70
isn’t 0 149 70
interested 0 149 70
in 0 149 70

an 0 149 72

so 0 149 74
far 0 149 74

was 0 149 75
quoted 0 149 75
by 0 149 75
his 0 149 75
close 0 149 75
friend, 0 149 75
Rabbi 0 149 75
Abraham 0 149 75
Skorka, 0 149 75
“In 0 149 75
my 0 149 75
diocese 0 149 75
it 0 149 75
never 0 149 75
happened 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
me, 0 149 75
but 0 149 75
a 0 149 75
bishop 0 149 75
called 0 149 75
me 0 149 75
once 0 149 75
by 0 149 75
phone 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
ask 0 149 75
me 0 149 75
what 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
do 0 149 75
in 0 149 75
a 0 149 75
situation 0 149 75
like 0 149 75
this.” 0 149 75
Francis 0 149 75
added 0 149 75
that 0 149 75
he 0 149 75
agreed 0 149 75
with 0 149 75
the 0 149 75
“zero 0 149 75
tolerance” 0 149 75
attitude 0 149 75
of 0 149 75
the 0 149 75
Irish 0 149 75
episcopate 0 149 75
and 0 149 75
admired 0 149 75
Pope 0 149 75
Benedict’s 0 149 75
reforms 0 149 75
– 0 149 75
most 0 149 75
of 0 149 75
which 0 149 75
he 0 149 75
was 0 149 75
later 0 149 75
to 0 149 75
quietly 0 149 75
reverse. 0 149 75

It 0 149 76
was 0 149 76
at 0 149 76
exactly 0 149 76
this 0 149 76
time, 0 149 76
however, 0 149 76
that 0 149 76
victims 0 149 76
from 0 149 76
Argentina 0 149 76
were 0 149 76
attempting 0 149 76
to 0 149 76
get 0 149 76
the 0 149 76
new 0 149 76
pope’s 0 149 76
attention. 0 149 76

One, 0 149 77
known 0 149 77
to 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
press 0 149 77
only 0 149 77
as 0 149 77
“Gabriel,” 0 149 77
wanted 0 149 77
to 0 149 77
talk 0 149 77
to 0 149 77
Francis 0 149 77
about 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
sexual 0 149 77
abuse 0 149 77
he 0 149 77
suffered 0 149 77
at 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
hands 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
Julio 0 149 77
César 0 149 77
Grassi, 0 149 77
accused 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
molesting 0 149 77
at 0 149 77
least 0 149 77
five 0 149 77
boys, 0 149 77
“who 0 149 77
has 0 149 77
been 0 149 77
avoiding 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
sentences 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
justice 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
Morón 0 149 77
and 0 149 77
the 0 149 77
Court 0 149 77
of 0 149 77
Cassation. 0 149 77

So 0 149 78
far, 0 149 78
judges 0 149 78
and 0 149 78
prosecutors 0 149 78
at 0 149 78
all 0 149 78
instances 0 149 78
found 0 149 78
him 0 149 78
guilty.” 0 149 78

In 0 149 79
case 0 149 79
anyone 0 149 79
thinks 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
Grassi-Gabriel 0 149 79
case 0 149 79
was 0 149 79
not 0 149 79
serious 0 149 79
enough 0 149 79
for 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
pope’s 0 149 79
attention, 0 149 79
Bishop 0 149 79
Accountability 0 149 79
summarises, 0 149 79
“A 0 149 79
year 0 149 79
after 0 149 79
Gabriel 0 149 79

filed 0 149 79
criminal 0 149 79
charges 0 149 79
[2003] 0 149 79

before 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
start 0 149 79
of 0 149 79
Grassi’s 0 149 79
trial, 0 149 79
three 0 149 79
men 0 149 79
ransacked 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
survivor’s 0 149 79
apartment 0 149 79
and 0 149 79
beat 0 149 79
him.” 0 149 79
These 0 149 79
men 0 149 79
threatened 0 149 79
to 0 149 79
kill 0 149 79
him 0 149 79
if 0 149 79
he 0 149 79
did 0 149 79
not 0 149 79
retract 0 149 79
his 0 149 79
testimony 0 149 79
and 0 149 79
quit 0 149 79
the 0 149 79
case. 0 149 79

charges], 0 149 80
in 0 149 80
May 0 149 80
2013, 0 149 80

his 0 149 80
conviction 0 149 80

2009, 0 149 80
“Gabriel 0 149 80
and 0 149 80
his 0 149 80
attorney, 0 149 80
Juan 0 149 80
Pablo 0 149 80
Gallego, 0 149 80
brought 0 149 80
a 0 149 80
two-page 0 149 80
letter 0 149 80
addressed 0 149 80

An 0 149 81

refused 0 149 81
to 0 149 81
accept 0 149 81
the 0 149 81

did 0 149 81
not 0 149 81
leave 0 149 81
the 0 149 81
premises.” 0 149 81

The 0 149 82
group 0 149 82
surmises 0 149 82
that 0 149 82
it 0 149 82
was 0 149 82
Bergoglio’s 0 149 82
direct 0 149 82
intervention 0 149 82
with 0 149 82
judges 0 149 82
in 0 149 82
the 0 149 82
case 0 149 82
that 0 149 82
prevented 0 149 82
a 0 149 82
conviction 0 149 82
against 0 149 82
Grassi 0 149 82
for 0 149 82
so 0 149 82
long 0 149 82
and 0 149 82
delayed 0 149 82
his 0 149 82
sentencing 0 149 82
through 0 149 82
multiple 0 149 82
appeals. 0 149 82

In 0 149 83
2006, 0 149 83
then-Archbishop 0 149 83
Bergoglio 0 149 83
complained 0 149 83
of 0 149 83
a 0 149 83
“media 0 149 83
campaign” 0 149 83
and 0 149 83
claimed 0 149 83
that 0 149 83
the 0 149 83
Grassi 0 149 83
case 0 149 83
was 0 149 83
“different” 0 149 83
from 0 149 83
other 0 149 83
accusations. 0 149 83

During 0 149 84
his 0 149 84
criminal 0 149 84
trial 0 149 84
Grassi 0 149 84
said 0 149 84
Bergoglio 0 149 84
“never 0 149 84
let 0 149 84
go” 0 149 84
of 0 149 84
his 0 149 84
hand. 0 149 84

In 0 149 85
2009, 0 149 85
Grassi 0 149 85
was 0 149 85
convicted 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
two 0 149 85
counts 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
aggravated 0 149 85

assault 0 149 85
and 0 149 85
corruption 0 149 85
in 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
case 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
“Gabriel,” 0 149 85
who 0 149 85
was 0 149 85
aged 0 149 85
13 0 149 85
at 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
time 0 149 85
of 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
abuse, 0 149 85
but 0 149 85
the 0 149 85
appeals 0 149 85
dragged 0 149 85
on 0 149 85
until 0 149 85
he 0 149 85
was 0 149 85
finally 0 149 85
sent 0 149 85

Several 0 149 86
more 0 149 86
similar 0 149 86
cases, 0 149 86
all 0 149 86
of 0 149 86
whom 0 149 86
were 0 149 86
rebuffed 0 149 86

their 0 149 86
attempts 0 149 86
to 0 149 86
meet 0 149 86
with 0 149 86
Bergoglio, 0 149 86
are 0 149 86
detailed 0 149 86
here, 0 149 86
for 1 149 86
the 1 149 86
strong-of-stomach. 1 149 86

A 1 149 87
virtuoso 1 149 87
performance-liar 1 149 87

Looking 0 149 88
back 0 149 88
and 0 149 88
carefully 0 149 88
examining 0 149 88
his 0 149 88
record, 0 149 88
Jorge 0 149 88
Bergoglio’s 0 149 88
mastery 1 149 88
of 0 149 88
using 0 149 88
the 0 149 88
weaknesses 0 149 88
of 0 149 88
morally 0 149 88
compromised 0 149 88
men 0 149 88
is 0 149 88
becoming 0 149 88
evident. 0 149 88

It 0 149 89
is 0 149 89
arguable 0 149 89
that 0 149 89
even 0 149 89
the 0 149 89
members 0 149 89
of 0 149 89
the 0 149 89
so-called 0 149 89
“San 0 149 89
Gallen 0 149 89
Mafia” 0 149 89
who 0 149 89
apparently 0 149 89
conspired 0 149 89
to 0 149 89
put 0 149 89
him 0 149 89
on 0 149 89
Peter’s 0 149 89
throne 0 149 89
were 0 149 89
used 0 149 89
by 0 149 89
him. 0 149 89

But 0 149 90
he 0 149 90
is 0 149 90
also 0 149 90
a 0 149 90
master 0 149 90
of 0 149 90
judging 0 149 90
an 0 149 90
audience 0 149 90
and 0 149 90
telling 0 149 90
them 0 149 90
what 0 149 90
they 0 149 90
expect 0 149 90
to 0 149 90
hear; 0 149 90
a 0 149 90
key 0 149 90
skill 0 149 90
for 0 149 90
all 0 149 90
grifters 0 149 90
and 0 149 90
confidence 0 149 90
tricksters. 0 149 90

Looking 0 149 91
carefully 0 149 91
at 0 149 91
the 0 149 91
infamous 0 149 91
“Who 0 149 91
am 0 149 91
I 0 149 91
to 0 149 91
judge” 0 149 91
comment, 0 149 91
this 0 149 91
was 0 149 91
clear 0 149 91
early 0 149 91
on. 0 149 91

The 0 149 92
first 0 149 92
part 0 149 92
of 0 149 92
that 0 149 92
interview 0 149 92
is 0 149 92
a 0 149 92
blatant 1 149 92
and 1 149 92
enormous 1 149 92
lie, 1 149 92
and 0 149 92
it 0 149 92
was 0 149 92
from 0 149 92
there 0 149 92
that 0 149 92
the 0 149 92
pope 0 149 92
moved 0 149 92
on 0 149 92
to 0 149 92
his 0 149 92
apology 0 149 92
for 0 149 92
homosexuality 0 149 92
in 0 149 92
general. 0 149 92

Recall 0 149 93
that 0 149 93
this 0 149 93
was 0 149 93
the 0 149 93
very 0 149 93
first 0 149 93
airplane 0 149 93
interview, 0 149 93
on 0 149 93
the 0 149 93
trip 0 149 93
back 0 149 93
to 0 149 93
Rome 0 149 93
from 0 149 93
World 0 149 93
Youth 0 149 93
Day 0 149 93
in 0 149 93
Rio, 0 149 93
a 0 149 93
matter 0 149 93
of 0 149 93
weeks 0 149 93
after 0 149 93
his 0 149 93
election. 0 149 93

At 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
time, 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
papal 1 149 94
apologists 1 149 94
sprang 0 149 94
instantly 0 149 94
into 0 149 94
action 0 149 94
and 0 149 94
we 0 149 94
heard 0 149 94
all 0 149 94
about 0 149 94
how 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
pope 0 149 94
was 0 149 94
talking 0 149 94
strictly 0 149 94
within 0 149 94
the 0 149 94
boundaries 0 149 94
of 0 149 94
Catholic 0 149 94
doctrine. 0 149 94

But 0 149 95
perhaps 0 149 95
in 0 149 95
hindsight, 0 149 95
we 0 149 95
are 0 149 95
ready 0 149 95
to 0 149 95
examine 0 149 95
the 0 149 95
full 0 149 95
implications 0 149 95
of 0 149 95
his 0 149 95
little 0 149 95
speech, 0 149 95
one 0 149 95
that 0 149 95
was 0 149 95
clearly 0 149 95
well-rehearsed. 0 149 95

(Don’t 0 149 96
forget, 0 149 96
no 0 149 96
question 0 149 96
is 0 149 96
asked 0 149 96
in 0 149 96
a 0 149 96
papal 0 149 96
interview 0 149 96
without 0 149 96
being 0 149 96
thoroughly 1 149 96
vetted 1 149 96
ahead 0 149 96
of 0 149 96
time. 0 149 96

Journalists 0 149 97
must 0 149 97
submit 0 149 97
their 0 149 97
questions 0 149 97
well 0 149 97
in 0 149 97
advance.) 0 149 97

This 0 149 98
was 0 149 98
the 0 149 98
pope 0 149 98
laying 0 149 98
out 0 149 98
his 0 149 98
policy 0 149 98
regarding 0 149 98
homosexuality, 0 149 98
a 0 149 98
policy 0 149 98
for 0 149 98
which 0 149 98
he 0 149 98
was 0 149 98
duly 1 149 98
rewarded 1 149 98
by 0 149 98
being 0 149 98
lauded 0 149 98
on 0 149 98
the 0 149 98
cover 0 149 98
of 0 149 98
the 0 149 98
homosexualist 0 149 98
lobby’s 0 149 98
US 0 149 98
trade 0 149 98
magazine. 0 149 98

Read 0 149 99
his 0 149 99
full 0 149 99
answer 0 149 99
carefully: 0 149 99

I 0 149 100
see 0 149 100
that 0 149 100
many 0 149 100
times 0 149 100
in 0 149 100
the 0 149 100
Church, 0 149 100
over 0 149 100
and 0 149 100
above 0 149 100
this 0 149 100
case, 0 149 100
but 0 149 100
including 0 149 100
this 0 149 100
case, 0 149 100
people 0 149 100
search 0 149 100
for 0 149 100
“sins 0 149 100
from 0 149 100
youth”, 0 149 100
for 0 149 100
example, 0 149 100
and 0 149 100
then 0 149 100
publish 0 149 100
them. 0 149 100

They 0 149 101
are 0 149 101
not 0 149 101
crimes, 0 149 101
right? 0 149 101

Crimes 0 149 102
are 0 149 102
something 0 149 102
different: 0 149 102
the 0 149 102
abuse 0 149 102
of 0 149 102
minors 0 149 102
is 0 149 102
a 0 149 102
crime. 0 149 102

No, 0 149 103
sins. 0 149 103

But 0 149 104
if 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
person, 0 149 104
whether 0 149 104
it 0 149 104
be 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
lay 0 149 104
person, 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
priest 0 149 104
or 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
religious 0 149 104
sister, 0 149 104
commits 0 149 104
a 0 149 104
sin 0 149 104
and 0 149 104
then 0 149 104
converts, 0 149 104
the 0 149 104
Lord 0 149 104
forgives, 0 149 104
and 0 149 104
when 0 149 104
the 0 149 104
Lord 0 149 104
forgives, 0 149 104
the 0 149 104
Lord 0 149 104
forgets 0 149 104
and 0 149 104
this 0 149 104
is 0 149 104
very 0 149 104
important 0 149 104
for 0 149 104
our 0 149 104
lives. 0 149 104

When 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
confess 0 149 105
our 0 149 105
sins 0 149 105
and 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
truly 0 149 105
say, 0 149 105
“I 0 149 105
have 0 149 105
sinned 0 149 105
in 0 149 105
this”, 0 149 105
the 0 149 105
Lord 0 149 105
forgets, 0 149 105
and 0 149 105
so 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
have 0 149 105
no 0 149 105
right 0 149 105
not 0 149 105
to 0 149 105
forget, 0 149 105
because 0 149 105
otherwise 0 149 105
we 0 149 105
would 0 149 105
run 0 149 105
the 0 149 105
risk 0 149 105
of 0 149 105
the 0 149 105
Lord 0 149 105
not 0 149 105
forgetting 0 149 105
our 0 149 105
sins. 0 149 105

That 1 149 106
is 1 149 106
a 1 149 106
danger. 1 149 106

This 0 149 107
is 0 149 107
important: 0 149 107
a 0 149 107
theology 0 149 107
of 0 149 107

sin. 0 149 108
Many 0 149 108
times 0 149 108
I 0 149 108
think 0 149 108
of 0 149 108
Saint 0 149 108
Peter. 0 149 108

He 0 149 109
committed 0 149 109
one 0 149 109
of 0 149 109
the 0 149 109
worst 0 149 109
sins, 0 149 109
that 0 149 109
is 0 149 109
he 0 149 109
denied 0 149 109
Christ, 0 149 109
and 0 149 109
even 0 149 109
with 0 149 109
this 0 149 109
sin 0 149 109
they 0 149 109
made 0 149 109
him 0 149 109
Pope. 0 149 109

We 0 149 110
have 0 149 110
to 0 149 110
think 0 149 110
a 0 149 110
great 0 149 110
deal 0 149 110
about 0 149 110
that. 0 149 110

But, 0 149 111
returning 0 149 111
to 0 149 111
your 0 149 111
question 0 149 111
more 0 149 111
concretely. 0 149 111

In 0 149 112
this 0 149 112
case, 0 149 112
I 0 149 112
conducted 0 149 112
the 0 149 112
preliminary 0 149 112
investigation 0 149 112
and 0 149 112
we 0 149 112
didn’t 0 149 112
find 0 149 112
anything. 0 149 112

This 0 149 113
is 0 149 113
the 0 149 113
first 0 149 113
question. 0 149 113

Then, 0 149 114
you 0 149 114
spoke 0 149 114
about 0 149 114
the 0 149 114
gay 0 149 114
lobby. 0 149 114

So 0 149 115
much 0 149 115
is 0 149 115
written 0 149 115
about 0 149 115
the 0 149 115
gay 0 149 115
lobby. 0 149 115

I 0 149 116
still 0 149 116
haven’t 0 149 116
found 0 149 116
anyone 0 149 116
with 0 149 116
an 0 149 116
identity 0 149 116
card 0 149 116
in 0 149 116
the 0 149 116
Vatican 0 149 116
with 0 149 116
“gay” 0 149 116
on 0 149 116

it. 0 149 117
They 0 149 117
say 0 149 117
there 0 149 117
are 0 149 117
some 0 149 117
there. 0 149 117

I 0 149 118
believe 0 149 118
that 0 149 118
when 0 149 118
you 0 149 118
are 0 149 118
dealing 0 149 118
with 0 149 118
such 0 149 118
a 0 149 118
person, 0 149 118
you 0 149 118
must 0 149 118
distinguish 0 149 118
between 0 149 118
the 0 149 118
fact 0 149 118
of 0 149 118
a 0 149 118
person 0 149 118
being 0 149 118
gay 0 149 118
and 0 149 118
the 0 149 118
fact 0 149 118
of 0 149 118
someone 0 149 118
forming 0 149 118
a 0 149 118
lobby, 0 149 118
because 0 149 118
not 0 149 118
all 0 149 118
lobbies 0 149 118
are 0 149 118

good. 0 149 119
This 0 149 119
one 0 149 119
is 0 149 119
not 0 149 119

good. 0 149 120
If 0 149 120
someone 0 149 120
is 0 149 120
gay 0 149 120
and 0 149 120
is 0 149 120
searching 0 149 120
for 0 149 120
the 0 149 120
Lord 0 149 120
and 0 149 120
has 0 149 120
good 0 149 120
will, 0 149 120
then 0 149 120
who 1 149 120
am 1 149 120
I 1 149 120
to 1 149 120
judge 1 149 120

him? 1 149 121
The 0 149 121
Catechism 0 149 121
of 0 149 121
the 0 149 121
Catholic 0 149 121
Church 0 149 121
explains 0 149 121
this 0 149 121
in 0 149 121
a 0 149 121
beautiful 0 149 121
way, 0 149 121
saying 0 149 121
... 0 149 121
wait 0 149 121
a 0 149 121
moment, 0 149 121
how 0 149 121
does 0 149 121
it 0 149 121
say 0 149 121
it 0 149 121
... 0 149 121
it 0 149 121
says: 0 149 121
“no 0 149 121
one 0 149 121
should 0 149 121
marginalize 0 149 121
these 0 149 121
people 0 149 121
for 0 149 121
this, 0 149 121
they 0 149 121
must 0 149 121
be 0 149 121
integrated 0 149 121
into 0 149 121
society”. 0 149 121

The 0 149 122
problem 0 149 122
is 0 149 122
not 0 149 122
having 0 149 122
this 0 149 122
tendency, 0 149 122
no, 0 149 122
we 0 149 122
must 0 149 122
be 0 149 122
brothers 0 149 122
and 0 149 122
sisters 0 149 122
to 0 149 122
one 0 149 122
another, 0 149 122
and 0 149 122
there 0 149 122
is 0 149 122
this 0 149 122
one 0 149 122
and 0 149 122
there 0 149 122
is 0 149 122
that 0 149 122

one. 0 149 123
The 0 149 123
problem 0 149 123
is 0 149 123
in 0 149 123
making 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
this 0 149 123
tendency: 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
misers, 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
politicians, 0 149 123
a 0 149 123
lobby 0 149 123
of 0 149 123
masons, 0 149 123
so 1 149 123
many 1 149 123
lobbies. 1 149 123

For 0 149 124
me, 0 149 124
this 0 149 124
is 0 149 124
the 0 149 124
greater 0 149 124
problem. 0 149 124

Thank 0 149 125
you 0 149 125
so 0 149 125
much 0 149 125
for 0 149 125
asking 0 149 125
this 0 149 125
question. 0 149 125

Many 0 149 126

thanks. 0 149 127
One 0 149 127
of 0 149 127
the 0 149 127
pope’s 0 149 127
favourite 0 149 127
rhetorical 0 149 127
techniques 0 149 127
is 0 149 127
a 0 149 127
combination 0 149 127
of 0 149 127
Begging 0 149 127
the 0 149 127
Question 0 149 127
and 0 149 127
conspiracy. 0 149 127

He 0 149 128
starts 0 149 128
by 0 149 128
assuming, 0 149 128
without 0 149 128
any 0 149 128
effort 0 149 128
at 0 149 128
defence 0 149 128
or 0 149 128
explanation, 0 149 128
a 0 149 128
point 0 149 128
that 0 149 128
concedes 0 149 128
the 0 149 128
whole 0 149 128

issue. 0 149 129
This 0 149 129
was 0 149 129
the 0 149 129
first 0 149 129
time 0 149 129
a 0 149 129
pope 0 149 129
had 0 149 129
ever 0 149 129
used 0 149 129
the 0 149 129
political 0 149 129
term 0 149 129

“gay”. 0 149 130
Not 0 149 130
“homosexual,” 0 149 130
not 0 149 130
“same-sex 0 149 130
attracted,” 0 149 130
but 0 149 130
“gay,” 0 149 130
meaning 0 149 130
that 0 149 130
he 0 149 130
started 0 149 130
by 0 149 130
adopting 0 149 130
the 0 149 130
entirety 0 149 130
of 0 149 130
the 0 149 130
homosexualist 0 149 130
movement’s 0 149 130
linguistic 0 149 130
manipulations. 0 149 130

Language 0 149 131
counts 0 149 131
in 0 149 131
politics, 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
a 0 149 131
pope 0 149 131
using 0 149 131
that 0 149 131
term 0 149 131
means 0 149 131
he 0 149 131
is 0 149 131
by 0 149 131
implication 0 149 131
starting 0 149 131
the 0 149 131
discussion 0 149 131
– 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
his 0 149 131
pontificate 0 149 131
– 0 149 131
by 0 149 131
aligning 0 149 131
himself 0 149 131
with 0 149 131
the 0 149 131
basic 0 149 131
tenets 0 149 131
of 0 149 131
a 0 149 131
movement 0 149 131
that 0 149 131
is 0 149 131
violently 1 149 131
opposed 1 149 131
to 0 149 131
Catholic 0 149 131
moral 0 149 131
teaching, 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
in 0 149 131
direct 0 149 131
opposition 0 149 131
to 0 149 131
his 0 149 131
immediate, 0 149 131
and 0 149 131
still 0 149 131
living, 0 149 131
predecessor. 0 149 131

In 0 149 132
this 0 149 132
case 0 149 132
too, 0 149 132
he 0 149 132
was 0 149 132
addressing 0 149 132
a 0 149 132
plane 0 149 132
load 0 149 132
of 0 149 132
journalists 0 149 132
who 0 149 132
were 0 149 132
either 0 149 132
secular 0 149 132
themselves, 0 149 132
or 0 149 132
for 0 149 132
the 0 149 132
most 0 149 132
part 0 149 132
are 0 149 132
the 0 149 132
kind 0 149 132
of 0 149 132
Catholic 0 149 132
who 0 149 132
believes 0 149 132
it 0 149 132
is 0 149 132
fine 0 149 132
to 0 149 132
“disagree” 0 149 132
with 0 149 132
Catholic 0 149 132
teaching 0 149 132
on 0 149 132
sexuality. 0 149 132

There 0 149 133
are 0 149 133
very 0 149 133
few 0 149 133
“conservative” 0 149 133
Catholics 0 149 133
in 0 149 133
the 0 149 133
Vatican 0 149 133
journalist 0 149 133

pool. 0 149 134
This 0 149 134
means 0 149 134
that 0 149 134
his 0 149 134
use 0 149 134
of 0 149 134
this 0 149 134
language 0 149 134
was 0 149 134
a 0 149 134
conspiratorial 0 149 134
wink 0 149 134
and 0 149 134
nod 0 149 134
to 0 149 134
his 0 149 134
immediate 0 149 134
audience, 0 149 134
a 0 149 134
sly 0 149 134
message 0 149 134
to 0 149 134
say, 0 149 134
“People 0 149 134
talk 0 149 134
all 0 149 134
the 0 149 134
time 0 149 134
about 0 149 134
a 0 149 134
gay 0 149 134
lobby, 0 149 134
but 0 149 134
you 0 149 134
and 0 149 134
I 0 149 134
both 0 149 134
know 0 149 134
this 0 149 134
is 0 149 134

and 1 149 134
hip 1 149 134

don’t 1 149 134
hate 1 149 134
gays, 1 149 134

do 1 149 135
we?” 1 149 135
This 0 149 135
astonishing 0 149 135
departure 0 149 135
follows 0 149 135
an 0 149 135
implied 0 149 135
but 0 149 135
very 0 149 135
clear 0 149 135
assertion 0 149 135
that 0 149 135
Ricca 0 149 135
has 0 149 135
repented 0 149 135
and 0 149 135
given 0 149 135
up 0 149 135
his 0 149 135
activity, 0 149 135
an 0 149 135
assertion 0 149 135
that 0 149 135
has 0 149 135
absolutely 0 149 135
no 0 149 135
evidence 0 149 135
to 0 149 135
back 0 149 135

it 0 149 136
up. 0 149 136
We 1 149 136
are 1 149 136
simply 1 149 136
asked 1 149 136
to 1 149 136
take 1 149 136
the 1 149 136
pope’s 1 149 136
word 1 149 136
for 1 149 136
it, 1 149 136
but 0 149 136
given 0 149 136
that 0 149 136
it 0 149 136
follows 0 149 136
his 0 149 136
astoundingly 1 149 136
brazen 1 149 136
lie 1 149 136
that 0 149 136
there 0 149 136
was 0 149 136
no 0 149 136
evidence 0 149 136
for 0 149 136
Ricca’s 0 149 136

activity 0 149 136
in 0 149 136
the 0 149 136
first 0 149 136
place, 0 149 136
we 0 149 136
can 0 149 136
take 0 149 136
the 0 149 136
assurance 0 149 136
for 0 149 136
what 0 149 136
it 0 149 136
seems 0 149 136
to 0 149 136
be 0 149 136

worth. 0 149 137
Next, 0 149 137
after 0 149 137
another 0 149 137
little 0 149 137
inside 0 149 137

about 0 149 137

(but 0 149 137
of 0 149 137
course 0 149 137
never 0 149 137

that 0 149 137
the 0 149 137
whole 0 149 137
thing 0 149 137
is 0 149 137
hysterical 1 149 137
nonsense 1 149 137
– 0 149 137
we 0 149 137
hear 0 149 137
a 0 149 137
direct 0 149 137
contradiction 0 149 137
to 0 149 137
Catholic 0 149 137

his 0 149 137
predecessor, 0 149 137
Pope 0 149 137
Benedict 0 149 137
Ratzinger. 0 149 137

“The 0 149 138
problem 0 149 138
is 0 149 138
not 0 149 138
having 0 149 138
this 0 149 138
tendency.” 0 149 138
Well, 0 149 138
actually, 0 149 138
your 0 149 138
holiness, 0 149 138
yes 0 149 138
it 0 149 138
is, 0 149 138
particularly 0 149 138
in 0 149 138
the 0 149 138
case 0 149 138
of 0 149 138
priests. 0 149 138

The 0 149 139
“tendency” 0 149 139
is 0 149 139
called 0 149 139
in 0 149 139
the 0 149 139
same 0 149 139
catechism 0 149 139
you 0 149 139
quote 0 149 139
“intrinsically 1 149 139
disordered” 1 149 139
and 0 149 139
Ratzinger 0 149 139
was 0 149 139
very 0 149 139
clear 0 149 139
that 0 149 139
this 0 149 139
“tendency” 0 149 139
is 0 149 139
a 0 149 139
sign 0 149 139
of 0 149 139
a 1 149 139
serious 1 149 139
emotional 1 149 139
dysfunction 1 149 139
that 1 149 139
“must” 1 149 139
preclude 1 149 139
a 1 149 139
man 1 149 139

A 0 149 141
few 0 149 141
months 0 149 141
ago 0 149 141
in 0 149 141
a 0 149 141
piece 0 149 141
for 0 149 141
the 0 149 141
Remnant, 0 149 141
I 0 149 141
talked 0 149 141
about 0 149 141
why 0 149 141
the 0 149 141
Church 0 149 141
(and 0 149 141
nearly 0 149 141
all 0 149 141
human 0 149 141
societies) 0 149 141
regard 0 149 141
lying 0 149 141
as 0 149 141

a 0 149 142
sin: 0 149 142
A 0 149 142
mistake 0 149 142
many 0 149 142
make 0 149 142
about 0 149 142
lying 0 149 142
is 0 149 142
to 0 149 142
understand 0 149 142
it 0 149 142
only 0 149 142
in 0 149 142
terms 0 149 142
of 0 149 142
morality. 0 149 142

But 0 149 143
Thomas 0 149 143
makes 0 149 143
the 0 149 143
point 0 149 143
that 0 149 143
it 0 149 143
is 0 149 143
first 0 149 143
a 0 149 143
matter 0 149 143
of 0 149 143
metaphysics. 0 149 143

Lying 0 149 144
is 0 149 144
an 0 149 144
act 0 149 144
at 0 149 144
variance 0 149 144
in 0 149 144
its 0 149 144
essence 0 149 144
with 0 149 144
the 0 149 144
nature 0 149 144
of 0 149 144
reality. 0 149 144

Thomistic 0 149 145
theology 0 149 145
teaches 0 149 145
that 0 149 145
it 0 149 145
is 0 149 145
by 0 149 145
lying 0 149 145
that 0 149 145
we 0 149 145
become 0 149 145
most 0 149 145
like 0 149 145
the 0 149 145
devil, 0 149 145
and 0 149 145
most 0 149 145
unlike 0 149 145
God, 0 149 145
because 0 149 145
we 0 149 145
are 0 149 145
trying 0 149 145
to 0 149 145
change 0 149 145
the 0 149 145
nature 0 149 145
of 0 149 145
reality 0 149 145
to 0 149 145
suit 0 149 145
our 0 149 145
own 0 149 145
purposes. 0 149 145

Habitual 0 149 146
lying 0 149 146
in 0 149 146
effect 0 149 146
changes 0 149 146
you 0 149 146
into 0 149 146
a 0 149 146
different 0 149 146
kind 0 149 146
of 0 149 146
being, 0 149 146
one 0 149 146
that 0 149 146
is 0 149 146
by 0 149 146
nature 0 149 146
an 0 149 146
opponent 0 149 146
of 0 149 146
Truth, 0 149 146
ordered 0 149 146
against 0 149 146

Truth. 0 149 147
This 0 149 147
of 0 149 147
course 0 149 147
means 0 149 147
that 0 149 147
a 0 149 147
person 0 149 147
whose 0 149 147
“orientation,” 0 149 147
as 0 149 147
we 0 149 147
might 0 149 147
say, 0 149 147
is 0 149 147
towards 0 149 147
falsehood, 0 149 147
even 0 149 147
when 0 149 147
he 0 149 147
is 0 149 147
at 0 149 147
any 0 149 147
given 0 149 147
moment 0 149 147
saying 0 149 147
something 0 149 147
true, 0 149 147
is 0 149 147
still 0 149 147
servicing 0 149 147
his 0 149 147

lies. 0 149 148
He 0 149 148
tells 0 149 148
the 0 149 148
truth 0 149 148
only 0 149 148
to 0 149 148
continue 0 149 148
to 0 149 148
control 0 149 148
and 0 149 148
manipulate 0 149 148
reality. 0 149 148

It 0 149 149
was 0 149 149
not 0 149 149
by 0 149 149
violence, 0 149 149
but 0 149 149
by 0 149 149
lying 0 149 149
and 0 149 149
manipulation, 0 149 149
by 0 149 149
issuing 0 149 149
half-truths 0 149 149
and 0 149 149
pretending 0 149 149
to 0 149 149
be 0 149 149
the 0 149 149
kind 0 149 149
of 0 149 149
man 0 149 149
he 0 149 149
was 0 149 149
not, 0 149 149
that 0 149 149
Shakespeare’s 0 149 149
character 0 149 149
Iago 0 149 149
earned 0 149 149
the 0 149 149
title 0 149 149
of 0 149 149
most 0 149 149
evil 0 149 149
character 0 149 149
in 0 149 149
English 0 149 149
literature. 0 149 149

Human 0 149 150
beings 0 149 150
are 0 149 150
naturally 0 149 150
ordered 0 149 150
towards 0 149 150
the 0 149 150
truth, 0 149 150
and 0 149 150
we 0 149 150
have 0 149 150
to 0 149 150
work 0 149 150
at 0 149 150
assuming 0 149 150

a 0 149 151
lie. 0 149 151
This 0 149 151
is 0 149 151
why 0 149 151
confidence 0 149 151
tricksters 0 149 151
can 0 149 151
be 0 149 151
successful, 0 149 151
why 0 149 151
lying 0 149 151
works 0 149 151
for 0 149 151
getting 0 149 151
what 0 149 151
you 0 149 151
want; 0 149 151
people 0 149 151
don’t 0 149 151
see 0 149 151
it 0 149 151

coming. 0 149 152
The 0 149 152
first 0 149 152
natural 0 149 152
assumption 0 149 152
is 0 149 152
trust, 0 149 152
at 0 149 152
least 0 149 152
at 0 149 152
the 0 149 152
basic 0 149 152
level 0 149 152
of 0 149 152
expecting 0 149 152
truth 0 149 152
most 0 149 152
of 0 149 152
the 0 149 152

time. 0 149 153
We 0 149 153
therefore 0 149 153
instinctively 0 149 153
see 0 149 153
lying 0 149 153
as 0 149 153
a 0 149 153
betrayal 0 149 153
of 0 149 153

trust. 0 149 154
Considering 0 149 154
how 0 149 154
much 0 149 154
trust 0 149 154
the 0 149 154
Catholic 0 149 154
faithful 0 149 154
had 0 149 154
in 0 149 154
the 0 149 154
papacy 0 149 154
until 0 149 154
about 0 149 154
1965, 0 149 154
how 0 149 154
much 0 149 154
un-earned 0 149 154
trust 0 149 154
Francis 0 149 154
started 0 149 154
with 0 149 154
just 0 149 154
by 0 149 154
being 0 149 154
elected, 0 149 154
this 0 149 154
pontificate 0 149 154
should 0 149 154
be 0 149 154
remembered 0 149 154
as 0 149 154
one 1 149 154
of 1 149 154
the 1 149 154
great 1 149 154
confidence 1 149 154

in 0 149 154
history. 0 149 154

Believing 0 149 155
Catholics 0 149 155
have 0 149 155
watched 1 149 155
aghast 1 149 155
as 0 149 155
this 0 149 155
pope 0 149 155
has 0 149 155
habitually 0 149 155
trampled 0 149 155
on 0 149 155
every 0 149 155
aspect 0 149 155
of 0 149 155
Catholic 0 149 155
teaching. 0 149 155

Sandro 0 149 156
Magister 0 149 156

piece 0 149 156
on 0 149 156
his 0 149 156
website 0 149 156
that 0 149 156
listed 0 149 156
in 0 149 156
dizzying 1 149 156
detail 1 149 156
the 0 149 156
many 0 149 156
times, 0 149 156
in 0 149 156
only 0 149 156
the 0 149 156
last 0 149 156
few 0 149 156
months, 0 149 156
that 0 149 156
pope 0 149 156

has 0 149 156
falsified 0 149 156
with 0 149 156
obvious 0 149 156
intention, 0 149 156
the 0 149 156
words 0 149 156
of 0 149 156
Christ 0 149 156
in 0 149 156
Scripture 0 149 156

the 0 149 156
teaching 0 149 156
of 0 149 156
the 0 149 156

Church. 0 149 157
Of 0 149 157
course 0 149 157
this 0 149 157
would 0 149 157
be 0 149 157
of 0 149 157
little 0 149 157
interest 0 149 157
to 0 149 157
secular 1 149 157
journalists, 1 149 157
who 0 149 157
have 0 149 157
paid 0 149 157
no 0 149 157
mind 0 149 157
to 0 149 157
his 0 149 157
habit 0 149 157
of 0 149 157
rewriting 0 149 157

the 0 149 157
sex 0 149 157

is 0 149 157
something 0 149 157
secular 1 149 157
journalists 1 149 157
are 0 149 157
very 0 149 157

a 0 149 157

is 0 149 158
a 0 149 158

– 0 149 158
that 0 149 158

truth, 0 149 158

to 0 149 158
him 0 149 158

as 0 149 158

a 0 149 159
tool. 0 149 159
Sociologists 0 149 159
talk 0 149 159
about 0 149 159
the 0 149 159
concept 0 149 159
of 0 149 159
the 0 149 159
“high 0 149 159
trust 0 149 159
society,” 0 149 159
one 0 149 159
in 0 149 159
which 0 149 159
citizens 0 149 159
believe 0 149 159
what 0 149 159
they 0 149 159
are 0 149 159
told 0 149 159
by 0 149 159
the 0 149 159
elites 0 149 159
and 0 149 159
trust 0 149 159
them 0 149 159
to 0 149 159
govern 0 149 159
and 0 149 159
protect 0 149 159
them 0 149 159
adequately. 0 149 159

They 1 149 160
warn 1 149 160
that 1 149 160
the 1 149 160
general 1 149 160
loss 1 149 160
of 1 149 160
trust 1 149 160
in 1 149 160
institutions 1 149 160
leads 1 149 160
to 1 149 160
a 1 149 160
general 1 149 160
state 1 149 160
of 1 149 160
chaos, 1 149 160
in 1 149 160
which 1 149 160
laws 1 149 160
on 1 149 160
the 1 149 160
books 1 149 160
matter 1 149 160
little 1 149 160
as 1 149 160
citizens 1 149 160
turn 1 149 160
to 1 149 160
their 1 149 160
last 1 149 160
resort 1 149 160
of 1 149 160
protecting 1 149 160
themselves 1 149 160
and 1 149 160
their 1 149 160
own 1 149 160
families. 1 149 160

This 0 149 161
is 0 149 161
the 0 149 161
way 0 149 161
societies 0 149 161
disintegrate. 0 149 161

It 0 149 162
has 0 149 162
been 0 149 162
said 0 149 162
many 0 149 162
times 0 149 162
that 0 149 162
the 0 149 162

has 0 149 162

the 0 149 162
Catholic 0 149 162
faithful, 0 149 162
and 0 149 162
this 0 149 162
is 0 149 162

true. 0 149 163
With 0 149 163
a 0 149 163
professional 1 149 163

trickster 1 149 163
on 0 149 163
the 0 149 163
papal 0 149 163
throne, 0 149 163
blatantly 1 149 163
using 1 149 163
lies 1 149 163
and 1 149 163
manipulation 1 149 163
to 0 149 163
maintain 0 149 163
power 0 149 163

through 0 149 163
an 0 149 163

radical 0 149 163
variance 0 149 163
with 0 149 163

before 0 149 163
that 0 149 163
predictable 0 149 163

occurs? 0 149 164
Are 0 149 164

of 0 149 167
it? 0 149 167
I 0 149 167
have 0 149 167
seen 0 149 167
a 0 149 167
veritable 0 149 167
chorus 0 149 167
of 0 149 167
Catholics 0 149 167
on 0 149 167
social 0 149 167
media 0 149 167
declaring 0 149 167
that 0 149 167
if 1 149 167
Paul 1 149 167
VI 1 149 167
is 1 149 167
canonised, 1 149 167
their 1 149 167
loss 1 149 167
of 1 149 167
faith 1 149 167
in 1 149 167
the 1 149 167
Church 1 149 167
as 1 149 167
an 1 149 167
institution 1 149 167
will 1 149 167
be 1 149 167
complete. 1 149 167

I 0 149 168
am 0 149 168
told 0 149 168
from 0 149 168
contacts 0 149 168
inside 0 149 168
the 0 149 168
Vatican 0 149 168

after 0 149 168
the 0 149 168
trip 0 149 168
to 0 149 168
Chile 0 149 168
Bergoglio’s 0 149 168
support 0 149 168
has 0 149 168
completely 0 149 168
dried 0 149 168

up. 0 149 169
He 0 149 169
has 0 149 169
no 0 149 169

he 0 149 169

to 0 149 169

himself 0 149 169

after 0 149 169
the 0 149 169

it 0 149 169
seems 0 149 169
that 0 149 169
perhaps 0 149 169
even 0 149 169
his 0 149 169

the 0 149 169
desired 0 149 169
effect 0 149 169
of 0 149 169
terrorising 1 149 169

even 0 149 170
a 0 149 170
“conservative” 0 149 170
Catholic, 0 149 170
echoed 0 149 170
this 0 149 170
concern, 0 149 170
saying 0 149 170
the 0 149 170
Barros 0 149 170
affair 0 149 170
has 0 149 170
“definitely 0 149 170

“All 0 149 171

find 0 149 171
it 0 149 171
very 0 149 171
difficult 0 149 171
now…and 0 149 171
cannot 0 149 171
understand 0 149 171
and 0 149 171
cannot 0 149 171
believe 0 149 171
that 0 149 171
this 0 149 171

It 0 149 172
may 0 149 172
seem 0 149 172
like 0 149 172
a 0 149 172
moment 0 149 172
to 0 149 172

in 0 149 172
reality 0 149 172
this 0 149 172

is 0 149 172
potentially 0 149 172
very 0 149 172
harmful 0 149 172
for 0 149 172
souls 0 149 172
in 0 149 172
the 0 149 172
long 0 149 172

There 0 149 173
is 0 149 173
a 0 149 173

this 0 152 21
bothers 0 152 21
the 0 152 21

because 0 152 21
they 0 152 21

an 1 152 21

he 0 152 21
continued. 0 152 21

Just 0 152 22
this 0 152 22
week, 0 152 22
we 0 152 22
reported 0 152 22
that 0 152 22
Hungary 0 152 22
had 0 152 22
grown 0 152 22
weary 0 152 22
of 0 152 22
the 0 152 22
talks 0 152 22
of 0 152 22
pushing 0 152 22
illegal 0 152 22
Muslim 0 152 22
migrants 0 152 22
on 0 152 22
their 0 152 22
country 0 152 22
and 0 152 22
Europe, 0 152 22
and 0 152 22
was 0 152 22
preparing 0 152 22
to 0 152 22
walk 0 152 22
away 0 152 22
from 0 152 22
the 0 152 22
negotiating 0 152 22
table. 0 152 22

Orban 0 152 23
has 0 152 23
taken 0 152 23
a 0 152 23
tough 0 152 23
stance 0 152 23
in 0 152 23
Hungary. 0 152 23

He 0 152 24
has 0 152 24
ordered 1 152 24
all 1 152 24
illegal 1 152 24
Muslim 1 152 24
invaders 1 152 24
to 1 152 24
get 1 152 24
out 1 152 24
of 1 152 24
Hungary 1 152 24
and 1 152 24
never 1 152 24
come 1 152 24
back. 1 152 24

In 0 152 25
December, 0 152 25
he 0 152 25
said 0 152 25
that 0 152 25
he 0 152 25
was 0 152 25
not 0 152 25
concerned 0 152 25
with 0 152 25
what 0 152 25
Brussels 0 152 25
wanted, 0 152 25
but 0 152 25
was 0 152 25
determined 0 152 25
to 0 152 25
defend 0 152 25
Hungary's 0 152 25
borders. 0 152 25

PM 0 152 26
Orban 0 152 26
has 0 152 26
done 0 152 26
just 0 152 26
that, 0 152 26
too. 0 152 26

Orban's 0 152 27
border 0 152 27
wall 0 152 27
virtually 0 152 27
eliminated 0 152 27
illegal 0 152 27
immigration. 0 152 27

Orban 0 152 28
is 0 152 28
openly 1 152 28
Christian 1 152 28
and 0 152 28
seems 0 152 28
to 0 152 28
understand 0 152 28
something 0 152 28
that 0 152 28
many 0 152 28
do 0 152 28
not 0 152 28
and 0 152 28
that 0 152 28
is 0 152 28
you 0 152 28
do 0 152 28
not 0 152 28
allow 0 152 28
a 0 152 28
wholesale 0 152 28
flood 1 152 28
of 1 152 28
antichrists 1 152 28
to 0 152 28
pour 0 152 28
into 0 152 28
your 0 152 28
country. 0 152 28

Were 1 152 29
the 1 152 29
Ammonites 1 152 29
and 1 152 29
Moabites 1 152 29
not 1 152 29
kept 1 152 29

of 1 152 29
the 1 152 29
assembly 1 152 29
of 1 152 29
Israel 1 152 29
because 1 152 29
of 1 152 29
their 1 152 29
hatred 1 152 29
of 1 152 29
the 1 152 29

of 1 152 29
God? 1 152 29

(Deuteronoy 1 152 30

Yes, 0 152 30
they 0 152 30
were. 0 152 30

While 0 152 31
Muslims 0 152 31
need 0 152 31
the 0 152 31
Gospel 0 152 31
for 0 152 31
sure, 0 152 31
one 1 152 31
cannot 1 152 31

such 1 152 31
an 1 152 31

into 1 152 31
the 1 152 31

or 1 152 31
all 1 152 31
you 1 152 31
are 1 152 31
asking 1 152 31
for 1 152 31
is 1 152 31
the 1 152 31
judgments 1 152 31
God 1 152 31
warned 1 152 31
about 1 152 31
in 1 152 31

I 0 152 32
say, 0 152 32
well 1 152 32
done 1 152 32
Mr. 0 152 32
Orban. 0 152 32

Note: 0 31 1
This 0 31 1
is 0 31 1
probably 0 31 1
a 0 31 1
reason 0 31 1
why 0 31 1
reporters 0 31 1
Laura 0 31 1
Loomer 0 31 1
and 0 31 1
Mike 0 31 1
Tokes 0 31 1
were 0 31 1
barred 0 31 1
from 0 31 1
entering 0 31 1
the 0 31 1
presser. 0 31 1

They 0 31 2
would 0 31 2
have 0 31 2
posed 0 31 2
real 0 31 2
genuine 0 31 2
questions 0 31 2
of 0 31 2
Sheriff 0 31 2
Lombardo 0 31 2

forced 0 31 2
him 0 31 2
to 0 31 2

all 0 31 2
over 0 31 2
himself 0 31 2

them. 0 31 2

The 0 31 3
words 0 31 3
“conspiracy 1 31 3
theorists” 1 31 3
are 0 31 3
being 0 31 3
bandied 0 31 3
about. 0 31 3

Are 1 31 4
they 1 31 4
for 1 31 4
real? 1 31 4

A 0 31 5
well-coordinated, 0 31 5
meticulously 0 31 5
planned 0 31 5
attack 0 31 5

Americans 0 31 5

with 0 31 5
over 0 31 5
500 0 31 5

and 0 31 5
they 0 31 5
have 0 31 5
no 0 31 5
explanation 0 31 5
or 0 31 5
motive. 0 31 5

Do 1 31 6
the 1 31 6
FBI 1 31 6
and 1 31 6
law 1 31 6
enforcement 1 31 6
think 1 31 6
people 1 31 6
won’t 1 31 6
talk 1 31 6
about 1 31 6
it 1 31 6
or 1 31 6
speculate 1 31 6
as 1 31 6
to 1 31 6
what 1 31 6
happened? 1 31 6

Are 1 31 7
they 1 31 7
for 1 31 7
real? 1 31 7

Further, 1 31 8
the 1 31 8
FBI 1 31 8
insists 1 31 8
there 1 31 8
is 1 31 8
no 1 31 8
jihad 1 31 8
motive, 1 31 8
while 1 31 8
saying 1 31 8
they 1 31 8
don’t 1 31 8
know 1 31 8
his 1 31 8
motive. 1 31 8

How 0 31 9
can 0 31 9
they 0 31 9
possibly 0 31 9
hold 0 31 9
those 0 31 9
two 0 31 9
contradictory 0 31 9
ideas 0 31 9
at 0 31 9
the 0 31 9

don’t 0 31 13
agree 0 31 13
on 0 31 13
some 0 31 13
details. 0 31 13

I 0 31 14
realize 0 31 14
that 0 31 14
in 0 31 14
the 0 31 14
heat 0 31 14
of 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
shooting, 0 31 14
particularly 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
mass 0 31 14
shooting, 0 31 14
it 0 31 14
may 0 31 14
take 0 31 14
some 0 31 14
time 0 31 14
for 0 31 14
a 0 31 14
precise 0 31 14
timeline 0 31 14
to 0 31 14
develop. 0 31 14

But 0 31 15
it 0 31 15
didn’t 0 31 15
take 0 31 15
very 0 31 15
long 0 31 15
for 0 31 15
the 0 31 15
Las 0 31 15

to 0 31 15
release 0 31 15
a 0 31 15
precise 0 31 15
timeline. 0 31 15

The 0 31 16
initial 0 31 16
timeline 0 31 16
was 0 31 16
that 0 31 16
Stephen 0 31 16
Paddock’s 0 31 16
shooting 0 31 16
stopped 0 31 16
when, 0 31 16
approximately 0 31 16
6 0 31 16
minutes 0 31 16
after 0 31 16
he 0 31 16
started, 0 31 16
he 0 31 16
was 0 31 16
interrupted 0 31 16
by 0 31 16
a 0 31 16

Paddock 0 31 17
then 0 31 17
turned 0 31 17
his 0 31 17
fire 0 31 17
into 0 31 17
the 0 31 17
hallway, 0 31 17
firing 0 31 17
some 0 31 17
200 0 31 17
bullets, 0 31 17
and 0 31 17
after 0 31 17
that 0 31 17
the 0 31 17
shooting 0 31 17
stopped 0 31 17
as 0 31 17

backed 0 31 20
away 0 31 20
from 0 31 20
that 0 31 20

and 0 31 20
stated 0 31 20
that 0 31 20
the 0 31 20

actually 0 31 20
arrived 0 31 20
6 0 31 20

him. 0 31 20

That 1 31 21
raised 1 31 21
a 1 31 21
number 1 31 21
of 1 31 21
question, 1 31 21

why 0 31 21
no 0 31 21
one 0 31 21
called 0 31 21

after 0 31 21
what 0 31 21
must 0 31 21
have 0 31 21
been 0 31 21
a 0 31 21

six 0 31 27

The 0 31 28
confusion 0 31 28
began 0 31 28
Monday 0 31 28
when 0 31 28

back 0 31 30
on 0 31 30
this 0 31 30

first 0 31 30
saying 0 31 30
Tuesday 0 31 30
that 0 31 30
there 0 31 30
were 0 31 30
unspecified 0 31 30

then, 0 31 30
on 0 31 30
Thursday, 0 31 30
releasing 0 31 30
a 0 31 30
statement 0 31 30
directly 0 31 30
contradicting 0 31 30
parts 0 31 30
of 0 31 30
what 0 31 30
the 0 31 30

said…. 0 31 30

Lombardo 0 31 31
had 0 31 31
said 0 31 31
Monday 0 31 31
that 0 31 31
Campos, 0 31 31
the 0 31 31
guard, 0 31 31
was 0 31 31
shot 0 31 31
at 0 31 31
9:59 0 31 31
p.m. 0 31 31
and 0 31 31
that 0 31 31
the 0 31 31
mass 0 31 31
shooting 0 31 31
began 0 31 31
at 0 31 31
10:05 0 31 31
p.m. 0 31 31

This 0 31 32
six-minute 0 31 32
gap 0 31 32
relayed 0 31 32
by 0 31 32
Lombardo 0 31 32
left 0 31 32
uncertain 0 31 32
whether 0 31 32
there 0 31 32
was 0 31 32
any 0 31 32
lag 0 31 32
in 0 31 32
alerting 0 31 32
police 0 31 32
to 0 31 32
the 0 31 32
source 0 31 32
of 0 31 32
the 0 31 32
gunfire 0 31 32
during 0 31 32
critical 0 31 32
moments. 0 31 32

Police 0 31 33
said 0 31 33
officers 0 31 33
arrived 0 31 33
on 0 31 33
the 0 31 33
32nd 0 31 33
floor 0 31 33
at 0 31 33
10:17 0 31 33
p.m., 0 31 33
two 0 31 33
minutes 0 31 33
after 0 31 33
Paddock 0 31 33
had 0 31 33
stopped 0 31 33
firing. 0 31 33

MGM, 0 31 34
though, 0 31 34
said 0 31 34
it 0 31 34
was 0 31 34
“confident” 0 31 34
that 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
9:59 0 31 34
p.m. 0 31 34
time 0 31 34
was 0 31 34
inaccurate 0 31 34
and 0 31 34
“was 0 31 34
derived 0 31 34
from 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
Mandalay 0 31 34
Bay 0 31 34
report 0 31 34
manually 0 31 34
created 0 31 34

without 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
benefit 0 31 34
of 0 31 34

we 0 31 34
now 0 31 34
have.” 0 31 34
The 0 31 34
company 0 31 34
also 0 31 34
disputed 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
suggestion 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
lag, 0 31 34
saying 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
shooting 0 31 34
rampage 0 31 34
began 0 31 34
within 0 31 34
a 0 31 34
minute 0 31 34
of 0 31 34
Campos 0 31 34
reporting 0 31 34
his 0 31 34
injury 0 31 34
on 0 31 34
the 0 31 34
32nd 0 31 34
floor. 0 31 34

On 0 31 35
Friday, 0 31 35
Lombardo 0 31 35
effectively 0 31 35
agreed 0 31 35
with 0 31 35
the 0 31 35
company’s 0 31 35
statement, 0 31 35
though 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
argued 0 31 35
that 0 31 35
the 0 31 35
9:59 0 31 35
p.m. 0 31 35
time 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
had 0 31 35
offered 0 31 35
four 0 31 35
days 0 31 35
earlier 0 31 35
“wasn’t 0 31 35
inaccurate 0 31 35
when 0 31 35
I 0 31 35
provided 0 31 35
it.” 0 31 35
Lombardo 0 31 35
said 0 31 35
he 0 31 35
was 0 31 35
told 0 31 35
this 0 31 35
time 0 31 35
had 0 31 35
been 0 31 35
written 0 31 35
by 0 31 35
someone 0 31 35
in 0 31 35
a 0 31 35
security 0 31 35
log. 0 31 35

Upon 0 31 36
investigation, 0 31 36
Lombardo 0 31 36
said, 0 31 36
police 0 31 36
learned 0 31 36
that 0 31 36
Campos 0 31 36
first 0 31 36
encountered 0 31 36
a 0 31 36
barricaded 0 31 36
door 0 31 36
on 0 31 36
the 0 31 36
32nd 0 31 36
floor 0 31 36
at 0 31 36
9:59 0 31 36
p.m. 0 31 36

The 0 31 37
guard 0 31 37
was 0 31 37
eventually 0 31 37
fired 0 31 37
upon 0 31 37
by 0 31 37
Paddock 0 31 37
“in 0 31 37
close 0 31 37
proximity 0 31 37
to” 0 31 37
10:05 0 31 37
p.m., 0 31 37
when 0 31 37
the 0 31 37
mass 0 31 37
shooting 0 31 37
began, 0 31 37
Lombardo 0 31 37
continued. 0 31 37

Clear, 0 31 38
right? 0 31 38

Not 0 31 39
so 0 31 39
fast, 0 31 39
the 0 31 39
police 0 31 39
and 0 31 39
hotel 0 31 39
still 0 31 39
have 0 31 39
disagreement 0 31 39
over 0 31 39
important 0 31 39
details, 0 31 39
such 0 31 39
as 0 31 39
when 0 31 39
police 0 31 39
arrived 0 31 39
relative 0 31 39
to 0 31 39
Paddock’s 0 31 39
shooting 0 31 39
at 0 31 39
the 0 31 39
crowd: 0 31 39
An 0 31 39
enormous, 0 31 39
important 0 31 39
discrepancy 0 31 39
has 0 31 39
emerged 0 31 39
over 0 31 39
what 0 31 39
happened 0 31 39
during 0 31 39
the 0 31 39
Las 0 31 39
Vegas 0 31 39
massacre: 0 31 39
When 0 31 39
did 0 31 39
police 0 31 39
arrive 0 31 39
on 0 31 39
the 0 31 39
32nd 0 31 39
floor 0 31 39
where 0 31 39
Stephen 0 31 39
Paddock 0 31 39
was 0 31 39
firing 0 31 39
his 0 31 39
deadly 0 31 39
fusillade 0 31 39
onto 0 31 39
concertgoers 0 31 39
below? 0 31 39

Las 0 31 40
Vegas 0 31 40
police 0 31 40
say 0 31 40
they 0 31 40
didn’t 0 31 40
get 0 31 40
to 0 31 40
the 0 31 40
floor 0 31 40
until 0 31 40
after 0 31 40
the 0 31 40
shooting 0 31 40
was 0 31 40
over. 0 31 40

But 0 31 41
MGM 0 31 41
Resorts 0 31 41
International, 0 31 41
the 0 31 41
owner 0 31 41
of 0 31 41
Mandalay 0 31 41
Bay, 0 31 41
says 0 31 41
police 0 31 41
officers 0 31 41
were 0 31 41
there 0 31 41
shortly 0 31 41
after 0 31 41
the 0 31 41
shooting 0 31 41
began, 0 31 41
responding 0 31 41
to 0 31 41
a 0 31 41
report 0 31 41
of 0 31 41
a 0 31 41
security 0 31 41
guard 0 31 41
being 0 31 41
shot. 0 31 41

The 0 31 42
discrepancy 0 31 42
could 0 31 42
raise 0 31 42
questions 0 31 42
about 0 31 42
whether 0 31 42

have 0 31 42
taken 0 31 42
steps 0 31 42
to 0 31 42
intervene 0 31 42
while 0 31 42
Paddock 0 31 42
was 0 31 42
launching 0 31 42
his 0 31 42
devastating 0 31 42
10-minute 0 31 42
onslaught…. 0 31 42

in 0 31 43
response 0 31 43
to 0 31 43

MGM 0 31 43

issued 0 31 43
a 0 31 43

unequivocal: 0 31 43
Las 0 31 43
Vegas 0 31 43
police 0 31 43
officers 0 31 43
accompanied 0 31 43

to 0 31 43
the 0 31 43

and 0 31 43
“immediately 0 31 43

MGM 0 31 43

that 0 31 43
“Metro 0 31 43

reported 0 31 43
that 0 31 43

The 0 31 44
statement 0 31 44
says 0 31 44
MGM 0 31 44
believes 0 31 44
Paddock 0 31 44

out 0 31 44
the 0 31 44

These 1 31 44
discrepancies 1 31 44

The 0 32 3
JCPOA’s 0 32 3
fundamental 0 32 3
flaws 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
President 0 32 3
Trump 0 32 3

after 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
current 0 32 3

are 0 32 3
lifted. 0 32 3

Obama 0 32 4
and 0 32 4
Kerry 0 32 4
had 0 32 4
promised 0 32 4
that 0 32 4
these 0 32 4

was 1 32 6
the 1 32 6

that 1 32 6
recklessly 1 32 6
abandoned 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
facts 1 32 6
in 1 32 6
pressing 1 32 6
ahead 1 32 6
with 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
deal. 1 32 6

The 1 32 7
Obama 1 32 7
administration 1 32 7
lied 1 32 7
to 1 32 7
the 1 32 7
American 1 32 7
people, 1 32 7
abandoning 0 32 7
its 0 32 7
own 0 32 7
promises 0 32 7
to 0 32 7
ensure 0 32 7
that 0 32 7
the 0 32 7
deal 0 32 7
contained 0 32 7
ironclad 0 32 7
protections. 0 32 7

Moreover, 0 32 8
all 0 32 8
that 0 32 8
President 0 32 8
Trump 0 32 8
has 0 32 8
done 0 32 8
so 0 32 8
far 0 32 8
is 0 32 8
to 0 32 8
return 0 32 8
the 0 32 8
JCPOA 0 32 8
to 0 32 8
Congress 0 32 8
for 0 32 8
review. 0 32 8

Had 0 32 9
Obama 0 32 9
followed 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
Constitution 0 32 9
and 0 32 9
submitted 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
JCPOA 0 32 9
to 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
Senate 0 32 9
as 0 32 9
a 0 32 9
treaty 0 32 9
in 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
first 0 32 9
place, 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
JCPOA 0 32 9
in 0 32 9
its 0 32 9
present 0 32 9
form 0 32 9
almost 0 32 9
certainly 0 32 9
would 0 32 9
not 0 32 9
have 0 32 9
been 0 32 9
approved. 0 32 9

Congress 0 32 10
should 0 32 10
now 0 32 10
have 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
opportunity 0 32 10
to 0 32 10
revisit 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
JCPOA 0 32 10
to 0 32 10
determine 0 32 10
whether 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
protections 0 32 10
that 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
Obama 0 32 10
administration 0 32 10
promised 0 32 10
are 0 32 10
working 0 32 10
as 0 32 10
advertised. 0 32 10

Congress 0 32 11
should 0 32 11
also 0 32 11
consider 0 32 11
whether 0 32 11
time 0 32 11
limits 0 32 11
on 0 32 11
Iran’s 0 32 11
commitments 0 32 11
continue 0 32 11
to 0 32 11
make 0 32 11
sense 0 32 11
in 0 32 11
light 0 32 11
of 0 32 11
what 0 32 11
we 0 32 11
are 0 32 11
now 0 32 11
experiencing 0 32 11
with 0 32 11
Iran’s 0 32 11
nuclear 0 32 11
technology 0 32 11
collaborator, 0 32 11
North 0 32 11
Korea. 0 32 11

It 0 32 12
bought 0 32 12
time 0 32 12
to 0 32 12
turn 0 32 12
into 0 32 12
a 0 32 12
full-fledged 0 32 12
nuclear 0 32 12
power 0 32 12
under 0 32 12
our 0 32 12
noses. 0 32 12

Kerry 0 32 13
had 0 32 13
promised 0 32 13
that 0 32 13
the 0 32 13
Iranian 0 32 13
regime 0 32 13
would 0 32 13
be 0 32 13
prohibited 0 32 13
from 0 32 13
testing 0 32 13
ballistic 0 32 13
missiles. 0 32 13

This 0 32 14
turned 0 32 14
out 0 32 14
to 0 32 14
be 0 32 14
a 0 32 14
lie. 0 32 14

After 0 32 15
the 0 32 15
JCPOA 0 32 15
was 0 32 15
finalized, 0 32 15
with 0 32 15
no 0 32 15
such 0 32 15
prohibition 0 32 15
included, 0 32 15
Iran 0 32 15
continued 0 32 15
to 0 32 15
test 0 32 15
such 0 32 15
missiles. 0 32 15

The 0 32 16
Obama 0 32 16
administration’s 0 32 16
response 0 32 16
was 0 32 16
that 0 32 16
the 0 32 16
missiles 0 32 16
had 0 32 16
become 0 32 16
a 0 32 16
separate 0 32 16
issue, 0 32 16
to 0 32 16
be 0 32 16
dealt 0 32 16
with 0 32 16
under 0 32 16
a 0 32 16

the 0 32 16
JCPOA. 0 32 16

The 0 32 17
new 0 32 17
resolution 0 32 17
replaced 0 32 17
clear 0 32 17
prohibitions 0 32 17
imposed 0 32 17
on 0 32 17
Iran’s 0 32 17
ballistic 0 32 17
missile 0 32 17
program 0 32 17
with 0 32 17
a 0 32 17
weak 0 32 17
declaration 0 32 17
in 0 32 17
an 0 32 17
annex 0 32 17
that 0 32 17
simply 0 32 17
“calls 0 32 17
upon” 0 32 17
Iran 0 32 17
not 0 32 17
to 0 32 17

of 0 32 17
delivering 0 32 17
nuclear 0 32 17
weapons 0 32 17
for 0 32 17
eight 0 32 17
years. 0 32 17

Iran 0 32 18
has 0 32 18
tested 0 32 18
several 0 32 18
ballistic 0 32 18
missiles 0 32 18
during 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
last 0 32 18
two 0 32 18
years, 0 32 18
including 0 32 18
two 0 32 18
Qadr 0 32 18
H 0 32 18
missiles 0 32 18
with 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
phrase 0 32 18
“Israel 1 32 18
must 1 32 18
be 1 32 18
wiped 1 32 18
out” 1 32 18
emblazoned 0 32 18
on 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
sides. 0 32 18

The 0 32 19
commander 0 32 19
of 0 32 19
Iran’s 0 32 19
Army, 0 32 19
Major 0 32 19
General 0 32 19
Ataollah 0 32 19
Salehi, 0 32 19
had 0 32 19
told 0 32 19
reporters 0 32 19
just 0 32 19
a 0 32 19
month 0 32 19
before 0 32 19
the 0 32 19
launch 0 32 19
of 0 32 19
those 0 32 19
missiles 0 32 19
that 0 32 19
Iran 0 32 19
was 0 32 19
"neither 0 32 19
paying 0 32 19

nor 0 32 19
implementing 0 32 19
them. 0 32 19

This 0 32 20
is 0 32 20
not 0 32 20
a 0 32 20
breach 0 32 20
of 0 32 20
the 0 32 20

under 0 32 21
the 0 32 21

resolution, 0 32 21
asserted 0 32 21
that 0 32 21
the 0 32 21
Iranian 0 32 21
missile 0 32 21
test 0 32 21
did 0 32 21
not 0 32 21
violate 0 32 21
the 0 32 21
resolution. 0 32 21

“A 0 32 22

is 0 32 22
different 0 32 22
from 0 32 22
a 0 32 22
ban 0 32 22
so 0 32 22
legally 0 32 22
you 0 32 22
cannot 0 32 22

a 0 32 22

you 0 32 22

the 0 32 22

In 0 32 23
short, 0 32 23
the 0 32 23
JCPOA 0 32 23
did 0 32 23
not 0 32 23
cover 0 32 23
the 0 32 23
missile 0 32 23

National 0 32 24

Advisor 0 32 24
Ben 0 32 24
Rhodes 0 32 24
told 0 32 24
CNN, 0 32 24
during 0 32 24
an 0 32 24
interview 0 32 24
aired 0 32 24
on 0 32 24
April 0 32 24
6, 0 32 24
2015, 0 32 24
that 0 32 24
under 0 32 24
the 0 32 24
deal’s 0 32 24
terms 0 32 24
then 0 32 24
still 0 32 24
being 0 32 24
negotiated, 0 32 24
“you 0 32 24
will 0 32 24
have 0 32 24
anywhere, 0 32 24
anytime, 0 32 24
24/7 0 32 24
access 0 32 24
as 0 32 24
it 0 32 24
relates 0 32 24
to 0 32 24
the 0 32 24
nuclear 0 32 24
facilities 0 32 24
that 0 32 24
Iran 0 32 24
has." 0 32 24

Rhodes 0 32 25
claimed 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
“if 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
see 0 32 25
a 0 32 25
site 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
need 0 32 25
to 0 32 25
inspect 0 32 25
on 0 32 25
a 0 32 25
military 0 32 25
facility, 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
can 0 32 25
get 0 32 25
access 0 32 25
to 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
site 0 32 25
and 0 32 25
inspect 0 32 25
it. 0 32 25

So 0 32 26
if 0 32 26
it's 0 32 26
a 0 32 26
suspicious 0 32 26
site 0 32 26
that 0 32 26
we 0 32 26
believe 0 32 26

we 0 32 26

the 0 32 26

This 1 32 26
was 1 32 26
another 1 32 26
lie. 1 32 26

After 0 32 27
the 0 32 27
JCPOA 0 32 27

finalized 0 32 27
in 0 32 27
July 0 32 27
2015, 0 32 27
Rhodes 0 32 27
shamelessly 1 32 27
denied 1 32 27
that 0 32 27
anytime, 0 32 27
anywhere 0 32 27
inspections 0 32 27
were 0 32 27

the 0 32 27
negotiations. 0 32 27

“We 0 32 28
never 0 32 28
sought 0 32 28
in 0 32 28
this 0 32 28
negotiation 0 32 28
the 0 32 28
capacity 0 32 28
for 0 32 28
so-called 0 32 28
anytime, 0 32 28
anywhere,” 0 32 28
Rhodes 0 32 28
said 0 32 28
on 0 32 28
July 0 32 28
14, 0 32 28
2015. 0 32 28

The 0 32 29
JCPOA’s 0 32 29
supporters, 0 32 29
including 0 32 29
Kerry, 0 32 29
have 0 32 29
made 0 32 29
much 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
fact 0 32 29
that 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
International 0 32 29
Atomic 0 32 29
Energy 0 32 29
Agency 0 32 29
(IAEA) 0 32 29
has 0 32 29
on 0 32 29
several 0 32 29
occasions 0 32 29
verified 0 32 29
Iran’s 0 32 29
compliance 0 32 29
with 0 32 29
its 0 32 29
commitments 0 32 29
under 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
JCPOA, 0 32 29
keeping 0 32 29
its 0 32 29
stock 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
low-enriched 0 32 29

set 0 32 29
forth 0 32 29
in 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
JCPOA 0 32 29

not 0 32 29
pursuing 0 32 29
further 0 32 29
construction 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
Arak 0 32 29
reactor. 0 32 29

Iran 0 32 30
was 0 32 30
found 0 32 30
to 0 32 30
have 0 32 30
slightly 0 32 30
exceeded 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
limit 0 32 30
on 0 32 30
its 0 32 30
stock 0 32 30
of 0 32 30
heavy 0 32 30
water, 0 32 30
but 0 32 30
has 0 32 30
remedied 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
problem 0 32 30
to 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
IAEA’s 0 32 30
satisfaction. 0 32 30

IAEA 0 32 31
chief 0 32 31
Yukiya 0 32 31
Amano 0 32 31
reiterated 0 32 31
in 0 32 31
a 0 32 31
statement 0 32 31
he 0 32 31
issued 0 32 31
on 0 32 31
October 0 32 31
9th 0 32 31
that 0 32 31
Iran 0 32 31
has 0 32 31
remained 0 32 31
in 0 32 31
compliance 0 32 31
with 0 32 31
its 0 32 31
JCPOA 0 32 31
commitments. 0 32 31

The 0 32 32
problem, 0 32 32
as 0 32 32
any 0 32 32
clear-eyed 0 32 32
observer 0 32 32
of 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
process 0 32 32
recognizes, 0 32 32
is 0 32 32
that 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
IAEA 0 32 32
relies 0 32 32
on 0 32 32
Iran 0 32 32
for 0 32 32
self-inspection 0 32 32
of 0 32 32
certain 0 32 32
sites 0 32 32
that 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
regime 0 32 32
does 0 32 32
not 0 32 32
want 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
IAEA 0 32 32
to 0 32 32
inspect 0 32 32
freely 0 32 32
on 0 32 32
its 0 32 32
own. 0 32 32

IAEA 0 32 33
inspectors 0 32 33
have 0 32 33
avoided 0 32 33
examining 0 32 33
military 0 32 33
sites 0 32 33
it 0 32 33
knows 0 32 33
exists 0 32 33
and 0 32 33
has 0 32 33
no 0 32 33
reliable 0 32 33
way 0 32 33
of 0 32 33
tracking 0 32 33
undeclared 0 32 33
sites. 0 32 33

The 0 32 34
IAEA’s 0 32 34
explanation 0 32 34
for 0 32 34
not 0 32 34

is 0 32 34
that 0 32 34
it 0 32 34
had 0 32 34
“no 0 32 34
reason 0 32 34
to 0 32 34
ask” 0 32 34
for 0 32 34
access. 0 32 34

Evidently, 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
IAEA 0 32 35
is 0 32 35
supposed 0 32 35
to 0 32 35
block 0 32 35
out 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
fact 0 32 35
that 0 32 35
Iran 0 32 35
had 0 32 35
conducted 0 32 35
tests 0 32 35
relevant 0 32 35
to 0 32 35
nuclear 0 32 35
bomb 0 32 35
detonations 0 32 35
at 0 32 35
a 0 32 35
military 0 32 35
site 0 32 35
before 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
JCPOA’s 0 32 35
finalization 0 32 35
in 0 32 35
2015. 0 32 35

The 0 32 36
IAEA 0 32 36
should 0 32 36
just 0 32 36
pretend 0 32 36
that 0 32 36
such 0 32 36
tests 0 32 36
could 0 32 36
not 0 32 36
possibly 0 32 36
happen 0 32 36
again. 0 32 36

“Nobody 0 32 37
is 0 32 37
allowed 0 32 37
to 0 32 37
visit 0 32 37
Iran's 0 32 37
military 0 32 37
sites,” 0 32 37
said 0 32 37
Iran’s 0 32 37
Head 0 32 37
of 0 32 37
Strategic 0 32 37
Research 0 32 37
Center 0 32 37
at 0 32 37
the 0 32 37
Expediency 0 32 37
Council 0 32 37
and 0 32 37
adviser 0 32 37
to 0 32 37
Supreme 0 32 37
Leader 0 32 37
Ayatollah 0 32 37
Khamenei, 0 32 37
Ali 0 32 37
Akbar 0 32 37
Velayati. 0 32 37

Intimidation 0 32 38
works. 0 32 38

The 0 32 39
IAEA 0 32 39
knows 0 32 39
not 0 32 39
to 0 32 39
ask. 0 32 39

As 0 32 40
to 0 32 40
the 0 32 40
JCPOA’s 0 32 40
sunset 0 32 40
provisions, 0 32 40
the 0 32 40
Obama 1 32 40
administration 1 32 40
lied 1 32 40
about 1 32 40
that 1 32 40
too. 1 32 40

Kerry 0 32 41
claimed 0 32 41
on 0 32 41
September 0 32 41
2, 0 32 41
2015 0 32 41
that 0 32 41
the 0 32 41
JCPOA 0 32 41
“never 0 32 41
sunsets. 0 32 41

There’s 0 32 42
no 0 32 42
sunset 0 32 42
in 0 32 42
this 0 32 42
agreement.” 0 32 42

This 0 32 43
month 0 32 43
Kerry 0 32 43
has 0 32 43
resorted 0 32 43
to 0 32 43
parsing 0 32 43
words. 0 32 43

He 0 32 44
claims 0 32 44
the 0 32 44
phrase 0 32 44
'sunset 0 32 44
provisions' 0 32 44
is 0 32 44
a 0 32 44
“misnomer,” 0 32 44
before 0 32 44
then 0 32 44
defending 0 32 44
the 0 32 44
JCPOA’s 0 32 44
time 0 32 44
limits. 0 32 44

"We 0 32 45
were 0 32 45
comfortable 0 32 45
because 0 32 45
the 0 32 45
cap 0 32 45
on 0 32 45
Iran’s 0 32 45
low-enriched 0 32 45
uranium 0 32 45
stockpile 0 32 45
remains 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
place 0 32 45
until 0 32 45
2030,” 0 32 45
Kerry 0 32 45
wrote 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
an 0 32 45
article 0 32 45
published 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
the 0 32 45
Washington 0 32 45
Post 0 32 45
late 0 32 45
last 0 32 45
month. 0 32 45

In 0 32 46
other 0 32 46
words, 0 32 46
let’s 1 32 46
just 1 32 46
kick 1 32 46
the 1 32 46
can 1 32 46
down 1 32 46
the 1 32 46
road 1 32 46
and 0 32 46
hope 0 32 46
for 0 32 46
a 0 32 46
more 0 32 46
reasonable 0 32 46
Iranian 0 32 46
regime 0 32 46
in 0 32 46
13 0 32 46
years 0 32 46
that 0 32 46
would 0 32 46
agree 0 32 46
to 0 32 46
extend 0 32 46
the 0 32 46
time 0 32 46
limits. 0 32 46

In 0 32 47
the 0 32 47
meantime, 0 32 47
Kerry 0 32 47
advises 0 32 47
us 0 32 47
not 0 32 47
to 0 32 47
worry. 0 32 47

Kerry 0 32 48
declared, 0 32 48
“15 0 32 48
or 0 32 48
25 0 32 48
years 0 32 48
from 0 32 48
now, 0 32 48
we 0 32 48
still 0 32 48
have 0 32 48
the 0 32 48
same 0 32 48
military 0 32 48
options 0 32 48
we 0 32 48
have 0 32 48
today.” 0 32 48

John 0 32 49
Kerry 0 32 49
has 0 32 49
obviously 0 32 49
learned 0 32 49
nothing 0 32 49
from 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korean 0 32 49
fiasco, 1 32 49
which 0 32 49
resulted 0 32 49
from 0 32 49
years 0 32 49
of 0 32 49
phony 1 32 49
agreements 1 32 49
with 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
rogue 0 32 49
regime 0 32 49
and 0 32 49
so-called 0 32 49
“strategic 0 32 49
patience.” 0 32 49
The 0 32 49
United 0 32 49
States 0 32 49
clearly 0 32 49
does 0 32 49
not 0 32 49
have 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
same 0 32 49
military 0 32 49
options 0 32 49
today 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
deal 0 32 49
with 0 32 49
a 0 32 49
nuclear 0 32 49
armed 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korea 0 32 49
as 0 32 49
it 0 32 49
did 0 32 49
23 0 32 49
years 0 32 49
ago 0 32 49
when 0 32 49
former 0 32 49
President 0 32 49
Bill 0 32 49
Clinton 0 32 49
decided 0 32 49
not 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
use 0 32 49
military 0 32 49
force 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
stamp 0 32 49
out 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korea’s 0 32 49
nuclear 0 32 49
program 0 32 49
at 0 32 49
its 0 32 49
inception. 0 32 49

Instead, 0 32 50
Clinton 0 32 50
started 0 32 50
us 0 32 50
down 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
primrose 0 32 50
path 0 32 50
of 0 32 50
naïve 0 32 50
diplomacy 0 32 50
with 0 32 50
a 0 32 50
duplicitous 0 32 50
regime 0 32 50
that 0 32 50
now 0 32 50
is 0 32 50
on 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
verge 0 32 50
of 0 32 50
being 0 32 50
able 0 32 50
to 0 32 50
strike 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
U.S. 0 32 50
mainland 0 32 50
with 0 32 50
nuclear 0 32 50
warheads 0 32 50
delivered 0 32 50
by 0 32 50
intercontinental 0 32 50
ballistic 0 32 50
missiles. 0 32 50

It 0 32 51
is 0 32 51
precisely 0 32 51
because 0 32 51
North 1 32 51
Korea’s 1 32 51
actions 1 32 51
over 1 32 51
the 1 32 51
last 1 32 51
23 1 32 51
years 1 32 51
have 1 32 51
proven 1 32 51
that 1 32 51
making 1 32 51
concessions 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
a 1 32 51
rogue 1 32 51
regime 1 32 51
in 1 32 51
order 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
obtain 1 32 51
denuclearization 1 32 51
commitments 1 32 51
is 1 32 51
so 1 32 51
dangerous 1 32 51
that 1 32 51
President 1 32 51
Trump 1 32 51
does 1 32 51
not 1 32 51
want 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
make 1 32 51
the 1 32 51
same 1 32 51
mistake 1 32 51
with 1 32 51
Iran. 1 32 51

America’s 0 32 52
European 0 32 52
allies 0 32 52
are 0 32 52
also 0 32 52
upset 0 32 52
with 0 32 52
President 0 32 52
Trump 0 32 52
for 0 32 52
refusing 0 32 52
to 0 32 52
recertify 0 32 52
the 0 32 52
deal 0 32 52
and 0 32 52
threatening 0 32 52
to 0 32 52
pull 0 32 52
out 0 32 52
if 0 32 52
certain 0 32 52
conditions 0 32 52
are 0 32 52
not 0 32 52
met. 0 32 52

British 0 32 53
Prime 0 32 53
Minister 0 32 53
Theresa 0 32 53
May, 0 32 53
French 0 32 53
President 0 32 53
Emmanuel 0 32 53
Macron 0 32 53
and 0 32 53
German 0 32 53
Chancellor 0 32 53
Angela 0 32 53
Merkel 0 32 53
issued 0 32 53
a 0 32 53
joint 0 32 53
statement 0 32 53
last 0 32 53
Friday 0 32 53
praising 0 32 53
the 0 32 53
JCPOA 0 32 53
and 0 32 53
its 0 32 53
implementation. 0 32 53

They 0 32 54
said 0 32 54
that 0 32 54
the 0 32 54
nuclear 0 32 54
deal 0 32 54
with 0 32 54
Iran 0 32 54
was 0 32 54
“the 0 32 54
culmination 0 32 54
of 0 32 54
13 0 32 54
years 0 32 54
of 0 32 54
diplomacy 0 32 54
and 0 32 54
was 0 32 54
a 0 32 54
major 0 32 54
step 0 32 54
towards 0 32 54
ensuring 0 32 54
that 0 32 54
Iran’s 0 32 54
nuclear 0 32 54
programme 0 32 54
is 0 32 54
not 0 32 54
diverted 0 32 54
for 0 32 54
military 0 32 54
purposes. 0 32 54

Therefore, 0 32 55
we 0 32 55
encourage 0 32 55
the 1 32 55
US 1 32 55
Administration 1 32 55
and 1 32 55
Congress 1 32 55
to 1 32 55
consider 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
implications 1 32 55
to 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
security 1 32 55
of 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
US 1 32 55
and 1 32 55
its 1 32 55
allies 1 32 55
before 1 32 55
taking 1 32 55
any 1 32 55
steps 1 32 55
that 1 32 55
might 1 32 55
undermine 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
JCPOA, 1 32 55
such 1 32 55
as 1 32 55
re-imposing 1 32 55
sanctions 1 32 55
on 1 32 55
Iran 1 32 55
lifted 1 32 55
under 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
agreement.” 1 32 55

Perhaps 0 32 56
these 0 32 56
European 0 32 56
leaders 0 32 56
should 0 32 56
remember 0 32 56
their 0 32 56
own 0 32 56
history. 0 32 56

Mysteriously 1 34 0
Vanished 1 34 0
Into 1 34 0
Thin 1 34 0
Air 1 34 0

By 0 34 1
now, 0 34 1
we 0 34 1
have 0 34 1
all 0 34 1
heard 0 34 1
of 0 34 1
Jesus 0 34 1
Campos. 0 34 1

He’s 0 34 2
the 0 34 2
heroic 0 34 2
security 0 34 2
guard 0 34 2
that 0 34 2
allegedly 0 34 2
located 0 34 2
the 0 34 2
Las 0 34 2
Vegas 0 34 2
shooter, 0 34 2
Steven 0 34 2
Paddock. 0 34 2

But 0 34 3
the 0 34 3
narrative 0 34 3
surrounding 0 34 3
him 0 34 3
has 0 34 3
changed 0 34 3
wildly 0 34 3
since 0 34 3
the 0 34 3
authorities 0 34 3
mentioned 0 34 3
him, 0 34 3
and 0 34 3
now, 0 34 3
he’s 0 34 3
mysteriously 1 34 3
vanished 1 34 3
into 1 34 3
thin 1 34 3
air. 1 34 3

Of 0 34 4
course, 0 34 4
this 0 34 4
leads 0 34 4
many 0 34 4
to 0 34 4
believe 0 34 4
that 0 34 4
Campos 0 34 4
didn’t 0 34 4
even 0 34 4
exist, 0 34 4
to 0 34 4
begin 0 34 4
with. 0 34 4

His 1 34 5
mere 1 34 5
existence 1 34 5
appears 1 34 5
to 1 34 5
have 1 34 5
been 1 34 5
fabricated 1 34 5
by 1 34 5
the 1 34 5
very 1 34 5
authorities 1 34 5
who 1 34 5
are 1 34 5
cramming 1 34 5
lies 1 34 5
down 1 34 5
our 1 34 5
throats 1 34 5
about 1 34 5
this 1 34 5
massacre 1 34 5
for 1 34 5
the 1 34 5
sake 1 34 5
of 1 34 5
political 1 34 5
agendas. 1 34 5

There 0 34 6
are 0 34 6
two 0 34 6
conflicting 0 34 6
timelines 0 34 6
of 0 34 6
Campos’s 0 34 6
injury, 0 34 6
but 0 34 6
what 0 34 6
the 0 34 6
media 0 34 6
has 0 34 6
so 0 34 6
far 0 34 6
made 0 34 6
clear, 0 34 6
is 0 34 6
that 0 34 6
they 1 34 6
want 1 34 6
the 1 34 6
public 1 34 6
to 1 34 6
believe 1 34 6
Campos 0 34 6
was 0 34 6
walking 0 34 6
down 0 34 6
the 0 34 6
Mandalay 0 34 6
Bay 0 34 6
Hotel 0 34 6
& 0 34 6
Casino’s 0 34 6
32nd 0 34 6
floor 0 34 6
hallway, 0 34 6
when 0 34 6
Stephen 0 34 6
Paddock 0 34 6
spotted 0 34 6
him 0 34 6
on 0 34 6
a 0 34 6
camera 0 34 6
he’d 0 34 6
allegedly 0 34 6
set 0 34 6
up 0 34 6
in 0 34 6
a 0 34 6
room 0 34 6
service 0 34 6
cart, 0 34 6
just 0 34 6
outside 0 34 6
his 0 34 6
suite. 0 34 6

Once 0 34 7
he 0 34 7
saw 0 34 7
Campos, 0 34 7
Paddock 0 34 7
reportedly 0 34 7
fired 0 34 7
nearly 0 34 7
200 0 34 7
rounds 0 34 7
through 0 34 7
his 0 34 7
suite 0 34 7
door, 0 34 7
wounding 0 34 7
Campos 0 34 7
in 0 34 7
the 0 34 7
leg. 0 34 7

Moments 0 34 8
later 0 34 8
(6 0 34 8
minutes 0 34 8
actually, 0 34 8

But 0 34 9
Campos 0 34 9
has 0 34 9
been 0 34 9
a 0 34 9
mysterious 0 34 9
subject 0 34 9
since 0 34 9
being 0 34 9
wounded 0 34 9
in 0 34 9
the 0 34 9

Campos’s 0 34 11

said 0 34 11
he 0 34 11
got 0 34 11
a 0 34 11
text 0 34 11
that 0 34 11
Campos 0 34 11
had 0 34 11
been 0 34 11
taken 0 34 11
to 0 34 11

says 0 34 12
none 0 34 12

filled 0 34 12
out 0 34 12
an 0 34 12

for 0 34 12
a 0 34 12
patient 0 34 12
by 0 34 12
that 0 34 12
name, 0 34 12
and 0 34 12
Campos 0 34 12
has 0 34 12
been 0 34 12
silent 0 34 12
since 0 34 12
the 0 34 12
text; 0 34 12
vanishing 1 34 12
into 1 34 12
thin 1 34 12
air. 1 34 12

He 0 34 13
also 0 34 13
isn’t 0 34 13

“Right 0 34 14
now 0 34 14
I’m 0 34 14
just 0 34 14
concerned 0 34 14
where 0 34 14
my 0 34 14
member 0 34 14
is, 0 34 14
and 0 34 14
what 0 34 14
his 0 34 14
condition 0 34 14
is. 0 34 14

It’s 0 34 15
highly 0 34 15
unusual,” 0 34 15
Hickey 0 34 15
told 0 34 15
media. 0 34 15

“I’m 0 34 16
hoping 0 34 16
everything 0 34 16
is 0 34 16
OK 0 34 16
with 0 34 16
him 0 34 16

I’m 0 34 16
sure 0 34 16
MGM 0 34 16

the 0 34 16

will 0 34 16

know 0 34 16
when 0 34 16
we 0 34 16
hear 0 34 16
something,” 0 34 16
he 0 34 16
said. 0 34 16

In 0 34 17
the 0 34 17
meantime, 0 34 17
authorities 0 34 17
still 0 34 17
have 0 34 17
not 0 34 17
released 0 34 17
a 0 34 17
conclusive 0 34 17

for 0 34 17

President 0 35 2
Donald 0 35 2

No, 0 35 3
in 0 35 3
his 0 35 3

decertifying 0 35 3

with 0 35 3
his 0 35 3

Trump 0 35 3
didn’t 0 35 3
announce 0 35 3
a 0 35 3
new 0 35 3
strategy 0 35 3
for 0 35 3
preventing 0 35 3

Trump’s 0 35 4
move 0 35 4
was 0 35 4
not 0 35 4
operational. 0 35 4

It 0 35 5
was 0 35 5
directional. 0 35 5

In 0 35 6
his 0 35 6
address 0 35 6
Friday, 0 35 6
Trump 0 35 6
changed 0 35 6
the 0 35 6
policy 0 35 6
dynamics 0 35 6
that 0 35 6
dictate 0 35 6
US 0 35 6
policy 0 35 6
on 0 35 6
Iran. 0 35 6

For 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
first 0 35 7
time 0 35 7
since 0 35 7
2009, 0 35 7
when 0 35 7
Obama 0 35 7
backed 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
murderous 1 35 7
regime 1 35 7
in 0 35 7
Tehran, 0 35 7
spurning 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
millions 0 35 7
of 0 35 7
Iranians 0 35 7
who 0 35 7
rose 0 35 7
up 0 35 7
in 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
Green 0 35 7
Revolution, 0 35 7
Trump 0 35 7
opened 0 35 7
up 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
possibility 0 35 7
that 0 35 7
the 0 35 7

on 0 35 7

Trump 0 35 8
began 0 35 8
his 0 35 8
remarks 0 35 8
by 0 35 8
setting 0 35 8
out 0 35 8
Iran’s 1 35 8
long 1 35 8
rap 1 35 8
sheet 1 35 8
of 1 35 8
aggression 1 35 8
against 1 35 8
America. 1 35 8

Starting 0 35 9
with 0 35 9
the 0 35 9
US 0 35 9
embassy 0 35 9
seizure 1 35 9
and 1 35 9
hostage 1 35 9
crisis, 1 35 9
Trump 1 35 9
described 1 35 9
Iran’s 1 35 9
crimes 1 35 9
and 1 35 9
acts 1 35 9
of 1 35 9
war 1 35 9
against 1 35 9
America 1 35 9
in 0 35 9
greater 0 35 9
detail 0 35 9
than 0 35 9
any 0 35 9
of 0 35 9
his 0 35 9
predecessors 0 35 9
ever 0 35 9

did. 0 35 10
Trump’s 0 35 10
dossier 0 35 10
was 0 35 10
interlaced 0 35 10
with 0 35 10
condemnations 0 35 10
of 0 35 10
the 0 35 10
regime’s 0 35 10
repression 0 35 10
of 0 35 10
its 0 35 10
own 0 35 10
people. 0 35 10

By 0 35 11
merging 0 35 11
Iran’s 0 35 11
external 0 35 11
aggression 0 35 11
with 0 35 11
its 0 35 11
internal 0 35 11
repression, 0 35 11
Trump 0 35 11
signaled 0 35 11
a 0 35 11
readiness 0 35 11
to 0 35 11
drive 0 35 11
a 0 35 11
wedge 0 35 11
– 0 35 11
or 0 35 11
expand 0 35 11
the 0 35 11
wedge 0 35 11
– 0 35 11
between 0 35 11
the 1 35 11
authoritarian 1 35 11
theocrats 1 35 11
that 0 35 11
rule 0 35 11

and 0 35 11
the 0 35 11
largely 0 35 11
secular, 0 35 11
multiethnic 0 35 11
and 0 35 11
pro-Western 0 35 11
people 0 35 11
of 0 35 11

Iran. 0 35 12
Trump 0 35 12
then 0 35 12
turned 0 35 12
his 0 35 12
attention 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
Iran’s 0 35 12
illicit 0 35 12
ballistic 0 35 12
missile 0 35 12
program, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
sponsorship 1 35 12
of 1 35 12
terrorism, 1 35 12
including 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
links 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
al-Qaida, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
aggression 0 35 12
against 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
neighbors, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
aggressive 0 35 12
acts 0 35 12
against 0 35 12
maritime 0 35 12
traffic 0 35 12
in 0 35 12
the 0 35 12
Straits 0 35 12
of 0 35 12
Hormuz, 0 35 12
and 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
bids 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
destabilize 0 35 12
and 0 35 12
control 0 35 12
large 0 35 12
swaths 0 35 12
of 0 35 12
the 0 35 12
Middle 0 35 12
East 0 35 12
through 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
proxies. 0 35 12

It 0 35 13
is 0 35 13
notable 0 35 13
that 0 35 13
these 0 35 13
remarks 0 35 13
preceded 0 35 13
Trump’s 0 35 13
discussion 0 35 13
of 0 35 13
the 0 35 13
nuclear 0 35 13
deal 0 35 13
– 0 35 13
which 0 35 13
was 0 35 13
the 0 35 13
ostensible 0 35 13
subject 0 35 13
of 0 35 13
his 0 35 13

speech. 0 35 14
Before 0 35 14
Trump 0 35 14
discussed 0 35 14
Iran’s 0 35 14
breaches 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
nuclear 0 35 14
deal, 0 35 14
he 0 35 14
first 0 35 14
demonstrated 0 35 14
that 0 35 14
contrary 0 35 14
to 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
expressed 0 35 14
views 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
his 0 35 14
top 0 35 14
advisers, 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
is 0 35 14
impossible 0 35 14
to 0 35 14
limit 0 35 14
a 0 35 14
realistic 0 35 14
discussion 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
the 1 35 14
threat 1 35 14
Iran 1 35 14
constitutes 1 35 14
to 1 35 14
US 1 35 14
national 1 35 14
security 1 35 14
and 1 35 14
interests 1 35 14
to 0 35 14
whether 0 35 14
or 0 35 14
not 0 35 14
and 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
what 0 35 14
manner 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
is 0 35 14
breaching 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
nuclear 0 35 14

accord. 0 35 15
This 0 35 15
was 0 35 15
a 0 35 15
critical 0 35 15
point 0 35 15
because 0 35 15
for 0 35 15
the 0 35 15
past 0 35 15
two 0 35 15
years, 0 35 15
US 0 35 15
discourse 0 35 15
on 0 35 15
Iran 0 35 15
has 0 35 15
focused 0 35 15
solely 0 35 15
on 0 35 15
whether 0 35 15
or 0 35 15
not 0 35 15
Iran 0 35 15
was 0 35 15
complying 0 35 15
with 0 35 15
Obama’s 0 35 15
nuclear 0 35 15

pact. 0 35 16
By 0 35 16
placing 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
nuclear 0 35 16
deal 0 35 16
in 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
context 0 35 16
of 0 35 16
Iran’s 0 35 16
consistent, 0 35 16
overarching 1 35 16
hostility 1 35 16
and 1 35 16
aggression, 1 35 16
Trump 0 35 16
made 0 35 16
it 0 35 16
self-evident 0 35 16
that 0 35 16
no 0 35 16
US 0 35 16
interest 0 35 16
is 0 35 16
served 0 35 16
in 0 35 16
continuing 0 35 16
to 0 35 16
give 0 35 16
Iran 0 35 16
a 0 35 16
free 0 35 16
pass 0 35 16
from 0 35 16
congressional 0 35 16
sanctions. 0 35 16

After 0 35 17
accomplishing 0 35 17
that 0 35 17
goal, 0 35 17
Trump 0 35 17
turned 0 35 17
his 0 35 17
attention 0 35 17
to 0 35 17
how 0 35 17
Iran 0 35 17
is 0 35 17
actually 0 35 17
breaching 0 35 17
the 0 35 17
letter 0 35 17
and 0 35 17
spirit 0 35 17
of 0 35 17
the 0 35 17
nuclear 0 35 17

pact. 0 35 18
Only 0 35 18
then, 0 35 18
almost 0 35 18
as 0 35 18
an 0 35 18
afterthought, 0 35 18
did 0 35 18
he 0 35 18
announce 0 35 18
that 0 35 18
he 0 35 18
was 0 35 18
decertifying 0 35 18
Iranian 0 35 18
compliance 0 35 18
with 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
nuclear 0 35 18
deal, 0 35 18
setting 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
conditions 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
renewal 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
congressional 0 35 18
sanctions 0 35 18
on 0 35 18
Iran 0 35 18
and 0 35 18
opening 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
floodgates 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
congressional 0 35 18
sanctions 0 35 18
on 0 35 18
Iran 0 35 18
in 0 35 18
retaliation 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
full 0 35 18
spectrum 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
its 0 35 18
aggressive 1 35 18
and 1 35 18
illicit 1 35 18
acts 1 35 18

and 0 35 19
Russians 0 35 19

that 0 35 19
they 0 35 19

After 0 35 20
putting 0 35 20
them 0 35 20
on 0 35 20
notice, 0 35 20
Trump 0 35 20
discussed 0 35 20
the 0 35 20
possibility 0 35 20
of 0 35 20
improving 0 35 20
Obama’s 0 35 20
nuclear 0 35 20

accord. 0 35 21
Among 0 35 21
other 0 35 21
things, 0 35 21
he 0 35 21
suggested 0 35 21
expanding 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
inspection 0 35 21
regime 0 35 21
against 0 35 21
Iran’s 0 35 21

advancement. 0 35 22
Trump’s 0 35 22
address 0 35 22
has 0 35 22
the 0 35 22
potential 0 35 22
to 0 35 22
serve 0 35 22
as 0 35 22
the 0 35 22
foundation 0 35 22
of 0 35 22
a 0 35 22
major, 0 35 22
positive 0 35 22
shift 0 35 22
in 0 35 22
US 0 35 22
policy 0 35 22

toward 0 35 23
Iran. 0 35 23
Such 0 35 23
a 0 35 23
shift 0 35 23
could 0 35 23
potentially 0 35 23
facilitate 0 35 23
the 0 35 23
achievement 0 35 23
of 0 35 23
Trump’s 0 35 23
goals 0 35 23
of 0 35 23
preventing 0 35 23
Iran 0 35 23
from 0 35 23
acquiring 0 35 23
nuclear 0 35 23
weapons, 0 35 23
containing 0 35 23
its 0 35 23
regional 0 35 23
aggression 0 35 23
and 0 35 23
empowerment 0 35 23
and 0 35 23
defeating 0 35 23
its 0 35 23
terrorist 0 35 23

proxies. 0 35 24
Unfortunately, 1 35 24
it 1 35 24
is 1 35 24
also 1 35 24
likely, 1 35 24
indeed, 1 35 24
it 1 35 24
is 1 35 24
more 1 35 24
likely, 1 35 24
that 1 35 24
his 1 35 24
words 1 35 24
will 1 35 24
not 1 35 24
be 1 35 24
translated 1 35 24
into 1 35 24
policies 1 35 24
to 1 35 24
achieve 1 35 24
these 1 35 24

critical 1 35 25
aims. 1 35 25
Trump’s 0 35 25
decision 0 35 25
to 0 35 25
transfer 0 35 25
immediate 0 35 25
responsibility 0 35 25
to 0 35 25
Congress 0 35 25
for 0 35 25
holding 0 35 25

accountable 0 35 25
for 0 35 25
its 0 35 25
hostile 0 35 25
actions 0 35 25
on 0 35 25
the 0 35 25
military 0 35 25
and 0 35 25
other 0 35 25
fronts 0 35 25
is 0 35 25

a 0 35 26
risky 0 35 26
move. 0 35 26
He 0 35 26
has 0 35 26
a 0 35 26
lot 0 35 26
of 0 35 26
enemies, 0 35 26
and 0 35 26
the 0 35 26
nuclear 0 35 26
deal 0 35 26
has 0 35 26
a 0 35 26
lot 0 35 26
of 0 35 26
supporters 0 35 26
on 0 35 26

Capitol 0 35 27
Hill. 0 35 27
Obama 0 35 27
would 0 35 27
have 0 35 27
never 0 35 27
been 0 35 27
able 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
implement 0 35 27
his 0 35 27
nuclear 0 35 27
deal 0 35 27
if 0 35 27
Senator 0 35 27
Bob 0 35 27
Corker, 0 35 27
chairman 0 35 27
of 0 35 27
the 0 35 27
Senate 0 35 27
Foreign 0 35 27
Affairs 0 35 27
Committee, 0 35 27
hadn’t 0 35 27
agreed 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
cast 0 35 27
the 0 35 27
Constitution 0 35 27
aside 0 35 27
and 0 35 27
ignore 0 35 27
Obama’s 0 35 27
constitutional 0 35 27
duty 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
present 0 35 27
the 0 35 27
nuclear 0 35 27

to 0 35 27
the 0 35 27
Senate 0 35 27
for 0 35 27
ratification 0 35 27

as 0 35 28
a 0 35 28
treaty. 0 35 28
Over 0 35 28
the 0 35 28
past 0 35 28
week, 0 35 28
Trump 0 35 28
and 0 35 28
Corker 0 35 28
have 0 35 28
been 0 35 28
involved 0 35 28
in 0 35 28
an 0 35 28
ugly 1 35 28
public 1 35 28
fight 1 35 28
precipitated 0 35 28
by 0 35 28
Corker’s 0 35 28
announcement 0 35 28
that 0 35 28
he 0 35 28
will 0 35 28
not 0 35 28
be 0 35 28
seeking 0 35 28
reelection 0 35 28

next 0 35 29
year. 0 35 29
Today 0 35 29
Corker 0 35 29
has 0 35 29
nothing 0 35 29
to 0 35 29
restrain 0 35 29
him 0 35 29
from 0 35 29
scuttling 0 35 29

Trump’s 0 35 30
agenda. 0 35 30
If 0 35 30
he 0 35 30
wishes, 0 35 30
out 0 35 30
of 0 35 30
spite, 0 35 30
Corker 0 35 30
can 0 35 30
block 0 35 30
effective 0 35 30
sanctions 0 35 30

from 0 35 31
being 0 35 31
passed. 0 35 31
And 0 35 31
he 0 35 31
may 0 35 31
do 0 35 31
so 0 35 31
even 0 35 31
though 0 35 31
the 0 35 31
implications 0 35 31
for 0 35 31
his 0 35 31
Senate 0 35 31
colleagues 0 35 31
would 0 35 31
be 0 35 31
dire 0 35 31
and 0 35 31
even 0 35 31
though 0 35 31
doing 0 35 31
so 0 35 31
would 0 35 31
render 0 35 31
him 0 35 31
an 0 35 31
unofficial 0 35 31
protector 0 35 31
of 0 35 31
Iran’s 0 35 31

nuclear 0 35 32
program. 0 35 32
What 0 35 32
is 0 35 32
true 0 35 32
for 0 35 32
Corker 0 35 32
is 0 35 32
doubly 0 35 32
true 0 35 32

for 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Democrats. 0 35 33
Leading 0 35 33
Democratic 0 35 33
senators 0 35 33
like 0 35 33
Robert 0 35 33
Menendez, 0 35 33
Ben 0 35 33
Cardin 0 35 33
and 0 35 33
Chuck 0 35 33
Schumer, 0 35 33
who 0 35 33
opposed 0 35 33
Obama’s 0 35 33
Iran 0 35 33
deal 0 35 33
may 0 35 33
now 0 35 33
feel 0 35 33
that 0 35 33
as 0 35 33
opponents 0 35 33
of 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Trump 0 35 33
administration, 0 35 33
they 0 35 33
are 0 35 33
required 0 35 33
to 0 35 33
oppose 0 35 33
any 0 35 33
change 0 35 33
to 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Iran 0 35 33
Nuclear 0 35 33
Agreement 0 35 33

Review 0 35 34
Act. 0 35 34
Indeed, 0 35 34
given 0 35 34
the 0 35 34
rise 0 35 34
of 0 35 34
radical 0 35 34
forces 0 35 34
in 0 35 34
their 0 35 34
party 0 35 34
it 0 35 34
is 0 35 34
likely 0 35 34
that 0 35 34
they 0 35 34
would 0 35 34
rather 0 35 34
give 0 35 34
Iran 0 35 34
a 0 35 34
free 0 35 34
pass 0 35 34
for 0 35 34
its 0 35 34
anti-American 0 35 34
aggression 0 35 34
and 0 35 34
nuclear 0 35 34
proliferation 0 35 34
than 0 35 34
work 0 35 34
with 0 35 34
Republicans 0 35 34
on 0 35 34
Capitol 0 35 34
Hill 0 35 34
and 0 35 34

in 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
White 0 35 35
House. 0 35 35
Then 0 35 35
again, 0 35 35
by 0 35 35
framing 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
issue 0 35 35
of 0 35 35
Iran’s 0 35 35
threat 0 35 35
to 0 35 35
America 0 35 35
as 0 35 35
he 0 35 35
did, 0 35 35
and 0 35 35
by 0 35 35
transferring 0 35 35
responsibility 0 35 35
for 0 35 35
reinstating 0 35 35
sanctions 0 35 35
and 0 35 35
passing 0 35 35
further 0 35 35
sanctions 0 35 35
on 0 35 35
Iran 0 35 35
to 0 35 35
Congress, 0 35 35
Trump 0 35 35
opened 0 35 35
up 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
possibility 0 35 35
that 0 35 35
Congress 0 35 35
will 0 35 35
conduct 0 35 35
substantive 0 35 35
– 0 35 35
rather 0 35 35
than 0 35 35
personal 0 35 35

– 0 35 36
debates 0 35 36
on 0 35 36
Iran. 0 35 36
And 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
more 0 35 36
substantive 0 35 36
those 0 35 36
debates 0 35 36
become, 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
further 0 35 36
away 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
US 0 35 36
discourse 0 35 36
will 0 35 36
move 0 35 36
from 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
mendacious 0 35 36
assumptions 0 35 36
of 0 35 36
Obama’s 0 35 36
Iran 0 35 36
policy 0 35 36
– 0 35 36
that 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
Iranian 0 35 36
regime 0 35 36
is 0 35 36
a 0 35 36
responsible 0 35 36
actor 0 35 36
and 0 35 36
potential 0 35 36
US 0 35 36
ally, 0 35 36
and 0 35 36
that 0 35 36
there 0 35 36
is 0 35 36
nothing 0 35 36
inherently 0 35 36
aggressive 0 35 36
or 0 35 36
problematic 0 35 36
about 0 35 36
Iran’s 0 35 36
illicit 0 35 36
nuclear 0 35 36

weapons 0 35 37
program. 0 35 37
The 0 35 37
second 0 35 37
major 0 35 37
risk 0 35 37
inherent 0 35 37
in 0 35 37
Trump’s 0 35 37
approach 0 35 37
is 0 35 37
that 0 35 37
he 0 35 37
will 0 35 37
get 0 35 37
his 0 35 37
way; 0 35 37
that 0 35 37
the 0 35 37
Europeans, 0 35 37
Russians 0 35 37
and 0 35 37
Chinese 0 35 37
and 0 35 37
the 0 35 37
Iranians 0 35 37
will 0 35 37
agree 0 35 37
to 0 35 37
improve 0 35 37

the 0 35 38
nuclear 0 35 38
deal. 0 35 38
The 0 35 38
problem 0 35 38

here 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
not 0 35 39
obvious. 0 35 39
Clearly, 0 35 39
it 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
better 0 35 39
if 0 35 39
the 0 35 39
deal 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
amended 0 35 39
to 0 35 39
delete 0 35 39
the 0 35 39
sunset 0 35 39
clauses 0 35 39
and 0 35 39
expand 0 35 39

the 0 35 40
inspections 0 35 40
regime. 0 35 40
Yet 0 35 40
even 0 35 40
an 0 35 40
amended, 0 35 40
improved 0 35 40
deal 0 35 40
will 0 35 40
still 0 35 40
serve 0 35 40
as 0 35 40
a 0 35 40
shield 0 35 40
to 0 35 40

Iran’s 0 35 41
nuclear 0 35 41
program. 0 35 41
An 0 35 41
improved 0 35 41
deal 1 35 41
won’t 1 35 41
destroy 1 35 41

Iran’s 0 35 42
centrifuges. 0 35 42
It 1 35 42
won’t 1 35 42
take 0 35 42
away 0 35 42

Iran’s 0 35 43
enriched 0 35 43
uranium. 0 35 43
It 1 35 43
won’t 1 35 43
destroy 1 35 43
Iran’s 0 35 43

nuclear 0 35 44
installations. 0 35 44
And 0 35 44
it 1 35 44
won’t 1 35 44
bring 1 35 44
down 0 35 44
the 0 35 44
regime 0 35 44
which 0 35 44
by 0 35 44
its 0 35 44
nature 0 35 44
ensures 0 35 44
all 0 35 44
of 0 35 44
these 0 35 44
things 0 35 44
will 0 35 44
remain 0 35 44
a 1 35 44
menace 1 35 44
to 1 35 44
the 1 35 44
US, 1 35 44
its 1 35 44
allies 1 35 44
and 1 35 44
international 1 35 44

security 1 35 45
as 1 35 45
a 1 35 45
whole. 1 35 45
So 0 35 45
long 0 35 45
as 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
US 0 35 45
continues 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
maintain 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
policy 0 35 45
based 0 35 45
on 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
false 0 35 45
view 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
all 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
is 0 35 45
necessary 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
destroy 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
threat 0 35 45
of 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
armed 0 35 45
Iran 0 35 45
is 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
combination 0 35 45
of 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
deal 0 35 45
and 0 35 45
economic 0 35 45
sanctions, 0 35 45
it 0 35 45
will 0 35 45
continue 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
ensure 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
Iran 0 35 45
and 0 35 45
its 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
program 0 35 45

remain 0 35 46
a 0 35 46
major 0 35 46
threat. 0 35 46
Distressingly, 0 35 46
US 0 35 46
Ambassador 0 35 46
to 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
UN 0 35 46
Nikki 0 35 46
Haley, 0 35 46
the 1 35 46
most 1 35 46
outspoken 1 35 46
supporter 1 35 46
of 0 35 46
decertifying 0 35 46
Iranian 0 35 46
compliance 0 35 46
in 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
Trump 0 35 46
administration, 0 35 46
told 0 35 46
NBC 0 35 46
on 0 35 46
Sunday 0 35 46

its 0 35 48

of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48

– 0 35 48
grounded 0 35 48
in 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
recognition 0 35 48
of 0 35 48

inherent 0 35 48
hostility 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48

– 0 35 48
Trump 0 35 48
opened 0 35 48
up 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
possibility 0 35 48
that 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
US 0 35 48
and 0 35 48
its 0 35 48

policy 0 35 48
for 0 35 48
confronting 0 35 48
and 0 35 48
defeating 0 35 48

Iran 0 35 49
and 0 35 49
its 0 35 49
proxies. 0 35 49
If 0 35 49
the 0 35 49
Iran 0 35 49
deal 0 35 49
and 0 35 49
sanctions 0 35 49
are 0 35 49
two 0 35 49
components 0 35 49
to 0 35 49
a 0 35 49
larger 0 35 49
strategy 0 35 49
rather 0 35 49
than 0 35 49
the 0 35 49
entire 0 35 49
strategy, 0 35 49

they 0 35 50
can 0 35 50
be 0 35 50
helpful. 0 35 50
A 0 35 50
wider 0 35 50
strategy 0 35 50
would 0 35 50
target 0 35 50
Iran’s 0 35 50
regional 0 35 50
aggression 0 35 50
by 0 35 50

Iraq, 0 35 50

Yemen, 0 35 51
Syria 0 35 51
and 0 35 51
Lebanon. 0 35 51
It 0 35 51
would 0 35 51
target 0 35 51
the 0 35 51

itself 0 35 51
by 0 35 51

the 0 35 51

domestic 0 35 52
opponents. 0 35 52
It 0 35 52
would 0 35 52
pin 0 35 52
down 0 35 52
Iranian 0 35 52
forces 0 35 52
by 0 35 52
arming 0 35 52

along 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
Iranian 0 35 52

and 0 35 53
Iraqi 0 35 53
Kurds. 0 35 53
Friday, 0 35 53
Trump 0 35 53
created 0 35 53
the 0 35 53
possibility 0 35 53

for 0 35 54
such 0 35 54
a 0 35 54
strategy. 0 35 54
It 0 35 54
is 0 35 54
up 0 35 54
to 0 35 54
members 0 35 54
of 0 35 54
Congress, 0 35 54
and 0 35 54
US 0 35 54
allies 0 35 54
like 0 35 54
Israel 0 35 54
and 0 35 54
the 0 35 54
Sunni 0 35 54

Trump 0 35 54

conceive 0 35 54

and 0 35 54

implement 0 35 54

it. 0 35 54

If 1 35 54

they 1 35 54

fail, 1 35 54

the 1 35 54

possibility 1 35 54

Trump 1 35 54

created 1 35 54

will 1 35 54

be 1 35 54

perhaps 1 35 54

irrevocably. 1 35 54

aggressive 0 37 4
actions 0 37 4
in 0 37 4
the 0 37 4

lifted 0 37 4

If 0 37 5

what 0 37 5

see 0 37 7
it 0 37 7
that 0 37 7
way, 0 37 7
however. 0 37 7

With 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
lifting 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
nuclear-related 0 37 8
sanctions 0 37 8
making 0 37 8
available 0 37 8
billions 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
dollars 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
Iran’s 0 37 8
leaders 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
further 0 37 8
finance 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
IRGC’s 0 37 8
exploits 0 37 8
in 0 37 8
Iraq, 0 37 8
Syria, 0 37 8
Lebanon, 0 37 8
Yemen 0 37 8
and 0 37 8
elsewhere, 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
regime 0 37 8
is 0 37 8
furious 0 37 8
that 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
Trump 0 37 8
administration 0 37 8
is 0 37 8
tightening 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
financial 0 37 8
screws 0 37 8
again, 0 37 8
even 0 37 8
if 0 37 8
for 0 37 8
reasons 0 37 8
not 0 37 8
directly 0 37 8
related 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
Iran’s 0 37 8
compliance 0 37 8
with 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
terms 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
nuclear 0 37 8
deal. 0 37 8

Thus, 1 37 9
it 1 37 9
is 1 37 9
threatening 1 37 9
U.S. 1 37 9
forces 1 37 9
and 1 37 9
bases 1 37 9
in 1 37 9
the 1 37 9
region. 1 37 9

A 0 37 10
couple 0 37 10
of 0 37 10
seemingly 0 37 10
unrelated 0 37 10
events 0 37 10
this 0 37 10
past 0 37 10
week 0 37 10
point 1 37 10
to 1 37 10
Iran’s 1 37 10
positioning 1 37 10
itself 1 37 10
for 1 37 10
more 1 37 10
aggressive 1 37 10
military 1 37 10
actions 1 37 10
that 1 37 10
could 1 37 10
place 1 37 10
U.S. 1 37 10
forces 1 37 10
in 1 37 10
harm’s 1 37 10
way. 1 37 10

On 0 37 11
Tuesday, 0 37 11
Major 0 37 11
General 0 37 11
Bagheri 0 37 11
landed 0 37 11
in 0 37 11
Damascus 0 37 11
for 0 37 11
talks 0 37 11
with 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
President 0 37 11
Bashar 0 37 11
Assad 0 37 11
and 0 37 11
senior 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
officials, 0 37 11
including 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
defense 0 37 11
minister 0 37 11
and 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
chief 0 37 11
of 0 37 11
staff 0 37 11
of 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
armed 0 37 11
forces. 0 37 11

Bagheri 0 37 12
is 0 37 12
quoted 0 37 12
as 0 37 12
saying 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
his 0 37 12
visit’s 0 37 12
purpose 0 37 12
was 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
“put 0 37 12
a 0 37 12
joint 0 37 12
strategy 0 37 12
on 0 37 12
continuing 0 37 12
co-ordination 0 37 12
and 0 37 12
co-operation 0 37 12
at 0 37 12
the 0 37 12
military 0 37 12
level.” 0 37 12
Some 0 37 12
experts 0 37 12
on 0 37 12
Iran 0 37 12
believe 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
Bagheri’s 0 37 12
visit 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
Damascus 0 37 12
at 0 37 12
this 0 37 12
time 0 37 12
is 0 37 12
intended 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
reinforce 0 37 12
a 0 37 12
message 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
Iran 0 37 12
will 0 37 12
continue 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
supply 0 37 12
weaponry 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
Syria 0 37 12
and 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
reinforce 0 37 12
the 0 37 12
presence 0 37 12
of 0 37 12
its 0 37 12
terrorist 0 37 12
proxy 0 37 12
Hezbollah 0 37 12
in 0 37 12
Syria. 0 37 12

This 1 37 13
will 1 37 13
not 1 37 13
only 1 37 13
serve 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
bolster 1 37 13
the 1 37 13
Assad 1 37 13
regime, 1 37 13
but 1 37 13
it 1 37 13
also 1 37 13
will 1 37 13
strengthen 1 37 13
Iran's 1 37 13
ability 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
follow 1 37 13
through 1 37 13
on 1 37 13
its 1 37 13
threats 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
the 1 37 13
U.S. 1 37 13
and 1 37 13
its 1 37 13
allies, 1 37 13
principally 1 37 13
Israel. 1 37 13

Meanwhile, 0 37 14
following 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
departure 0 37 14
of 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
Kurds 0 37 14
from 0 37 14
Kirkuk, 0 37 14
Iraq 0 37 14
earlier 0 37 14
this 0 37 14
week, 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
IRGC’s 0 37 14
operational 0 37 14
Al 0 37 14
Qods 0 37 14
arm 0 37 14
reportedly 0 37 14
established 0 37 14
a 0 37 14
command 0 37 14
center 0 37 14
and 0 37 14
five 0 37 14
bases 0 37 14
there. 0 37 14

According 0 37 15
to 0 37 15
Debkafile, 0 37 15
this 0 37 15
constitutes 0 37 15
“the 0 37 15
first 0 37 15
military 0 37 15
facility 0 37 15
Iran 0 37 15
has 0 37 15
ever 0 37 15
established 0 37 15
openly 0 37 15
in 0 37 15
Iraq.” 0 37 15
The 0 37 15
Kirkuk 0 37 15
region 0 37 15
holds 0 37 15
45 0 37 15
percent 0 37 15
of 0 37 15
Iraqi’s 0 37 15
oil. 0 37 15

The 1 37 16
Iraqi 1 37 16
branch 1 37 16
of 1 37 16
Iran’s 1 37 16
terrorist 1 37 16
proxy 1 37 16
Hezbollah 1 37 16
has 1 37 16
vowed 1 37 16
that 1 37 16
once 1 37 16
ISIS 1 37 16
is 1 37 16
defeated 1 37 16
it 1 37 16
will 1 37 16
start 1 37 16
killing 1 37 16
Americans, 1 37 16
as 1 37 16
it 1 37 16
has 1 37 16
done 1 37 16
before. 1 37 16

It 0 37 17
is 0 37 17
against 0 37 17
this 0 37 17
backdrop 0 37 17
that 0 37 17
U.S. 0 37 17
ambassador 0 37 17
to 0 37 17
the 0 37 17
United 0 37 17
Nations 0 37 17
Nikki 0 37 17
Haley 0 37 17
used 0 37 17
her 0 37 17
entire 0 37 17
speech 0 37 17
to 0 37 17
the 0 37 17
UN 0 37 17
Security 0 37 17
Council 0 37 17
on 0 37 17
Wednesday 0 37 17
to 0 37 17
denounce 0 37 17
the 0 37 17
Iranian 0 37 17
regime 0 37 17
on 0 37 17
multiple 0 37 17
grounds. 0 37 17

The 0 37 18
session 0 37 18
was 0 37 18
supposed 0 37 18
to 0 37 18
be 0 37 18
devoted 0 37 18
to 0 37 18
the 0 37 18
Israeli-Palestinian 0 37 18
conflict, 0 37 18
but 0 37 18
Ambassador 0 37 18
Haley 0 37 18
departed 0 37 18
from 0 37 18
the 0 37 18
monthly 0 37 18
ritual 0 37 18
during 0 37 18
which 0 37 18
Israel 0 37 18
is 0 37 18
normally 0 37 18
singled 0 37 18
out 0 37 18
for 0 37 18
criticism 0 37 18
by 0 37 18
other 0 37 18
Council 0 37 18
members. 0 37 18

She 0 37 19
went 0 37 19
after 0 37 19
Iran 0 37 19
instead. 0 37 19

She 0 37 20
explained 0 37 20
why 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Trump 0 37 20
administration 0 37 20
decided 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
take 0 37 20
“a 0 37 20
comprehensive 0 37 20
approach 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
confronting 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Iranian 0 37 20
regime,” 0 37 20
which 0 37 20
does 0 37 20
not 0 37 20
give 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
regime 0 37 20
a 0 37 20
get 0 37 20
out 0 37 20
of 0 37 20
jail 0 37 20
free 0 37 20
card 0 37 20
even 0 37 20
if 0 37 20
it 0 37 20
is 0 37 20
in 0 37 20
technical 0 37 20
compliance 0 37 20
with 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
loophole-ridden 0 37 20
nuclear 0 37 20
deal 0 37 20
agreed 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
by 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Obama 0 37 20
administration. 0 37 20

“We 0 37 21
can’t 0 37 21
talk 0 37 21
about 0 37 21
stability 0 37 21
in 0 37 21
the 0 37 21
Middle 0 37 21
East 0 37 21
without 0 37 21
talking 0 37 21
about 0 37 21
Iran,” 0 37 21
Ambassador 0 37 21
Haley 0 37 21
said. 0 37 21

“That’s 0 37 22
because 0 37 22
nearly 0 37 22
every 0 37 22
threat 0 37 22
to 0 37 22
peace 0 37 22
and 0 37 22
security 0 37 22
in 0 37 22
the 0 37 22
Middle 0 37 22
East 0 37 22
is 0 37 22
connected 0 37 22
to 0 37 22
Iran’s 0 37 22
outlaw 1 37 22
behavior. 1 37 22

The 0 37 23
United 0 37 23
States 0 37 23
has 0 37 23
now 0 37 23
embarked 0 37 23
on 0 37 23
a 0 37 23
course 0 37 23
that 0 37 23
attempts 0 37 23
to 0 37 23
address 0 37 23
all 0 37 23
aspects 0 37 23
of 0 37 23
Iran’s 0 37 23
destructive 0 37 23
conduct, 0 37 23
not 0 37 23
just 0 37 23
one 0 37 23
aspect. 0 37 23

It’s 0 37 24
critical 0 37 24
that 0 37 24
the 0 37 24
international 0 37 24
community 0 37 24
do 0 37 24
the 0 37 24
same. 0 37 24

Judging 0 37 25
Iran 0 37 25
by 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
narrow 0 37 25
confines 0 37 25
of 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
nuclear 0 37 25
deal 0 37 25
misses 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
true 0 37 25
nature 0 37 25
of 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
threat. 0 37 25

Iran 0 37 26
must 0 37 26
be 0 37 26
judged 0 37 26
in 0 37 26
totality 0 37 26
of 0 37 26
its 1 37 26
aggressive, 1 37 26
destabilizing, 1 37 26
and 1 37 26
unlawful 1 37 26
behavior. 1 37 26

To 1 37 27
do 1 37 27
otherwise 1 37 27
would 1 37 27
be 1 37 27
foolish.” 1 37 27

Ambassador 0 37 28
Haley 0 37 28
accused 0 37 28
the 0 37 28
Iranian 0 37 28
regime 0 37 28
of 0 37 28
continuing 0 37 28
to 0 37 28
“play” 0 37 28
the 0 37 28
Security 0 37 28
Council. 0 37 28

“Iran 0 37 29
hides 0 37 29
behind 0 37 29
its 0 37 29
assertion 0 37 29
of 0 37 29
technical 0 37 29
compliance 0 37 29
with 0 37 29
the 0 37 29
nuclear 0 37 29
deal 0 37 29
while 0 37 29
it 0 37 29
brazenly 0 37 29
violates 0 37 29
the 0 37 29
other 0 37 29
limits 0 37 29
on 0 37 29
its 0 37 29
behavior. 0 37 29

And 0 37 30
we 0 37 30
have 0 37 30
allowed 0 37 30
them 0 37 30
to 0 37 30
get 0 37 30
away 0 37 30
with 0 37 30
it. 0 37 30

This 0 37 31
must 0 37 31
stop.” 0 37 31

Ambassador 0 37 32
Haley 0 37 32
proceeded 0 37 32
to 0 37 32
list 0 37 32
various 0 37 32
violations 0 37 32
by 0 37 32
the 0 37 32
Iranian 0 37 32
regime 0 37 32
of 0 37 32
Security 0 37 32
Council 0 37 32
resolutions 0 37 32
pertaining 0 37 32
to 0 37 32
the 0 37 32
transfer 0 37 32
of 0 37 32
conventional 0 37 32
weapons 0 37 32
from 0 37 32
Iran 0 37 32
and 0 37 32
the 0 37 32
arming 0 37 32
of 0 37 32
terrorist 0 37 32
groups, 0 37 32
including 0 37 32
the 0 37 32
Houthi 0 37 32
rebels 0 37 32
in 0 37 32
Yemen 0 37 32
and 0 37 32
Hezbollah. 0 37 32

She 0 37 33
also 0 37 33
pointed 0 37 33
to 0 37 33
what 0 37 33
she 0 37 33
called 0 37 33
the 1 37 33
Iranian 1 37 33
regime’s 1 37 33
“most 1 37 33
threatening 1 37 33
act” 1 37 33
– 0 37 33
its 0 37 33
launch 0 37 33
of 0 37 33
ballistic 0 37 33
missiles 0 37 33
capable 0 37 33
of 0 37 33
carrying 0 37 33
nuclear 0 37 33
weapons. 0 37 33

“When 0 37 34
a 0 37 34
rogue 0 37 34
regime 0 37 34
starts 0 37 34
down 0 37 34
the 0 37 34
path 0 37 34
of 0 37 34
ballistic 0 37 34
missiles, 0 37 34
it 1 37 34
tells 1 37 34
us 1 37 34
that 1 37 34
we 1 37 34
will 1 37 34
soon 1 37 34
have 1 37 34
another 1 37 34
North 1 37 34
Korea 1 37 34
on 1 37 34
our 1 37 34
hands,” 1 37 34
Ambassador 0 37 34
Haley 0 37 34
said. 0 37 34

“If 1 37 35
it 1 37 35
is 1 37 35
wrong 1 37 35
for 1 37 35
North 1 37 35
Korea 1 37 35
to 1 37 35
do 1 37 35
this, 1 37 35
why 1 37 35
doesn’t 1 37 35
that 1 37 35
same 1 37 35

apply 1 37 35

The 0 37 39

on 0 37 40

for 0 37 40

that 0 37 40

at 0 37 41
the 0 37 41
very 0 37 41
same 0 37 41
time 0 37 41
that 0 37 41
Iran 0 37 41
was 0 37 41
negotiating 0 37 41
the 0 37 41
nuclear 0 37 41

with 0 37 43
a 1 37 43
modicum 1 37 43
of 1 37 43
sense 1 37 43
really 0 37 43
believe 0 37 43
that 0 37 43
such 0 37 43

today? 0 37 43

Iran 0 37 44
is 0 37 44
flush 0 37 44
with 0 37 44
cash, 0 37 44
thanks 0 37 44
to 0 37 44
the 0 37 44
JCPOA. 0 37 44

It 0 37 45
wants 0 37 45
to 0 37 45
build 0 37 45
out 0 37 45

the 0 37 46
nuclear 0 37 46
deal, 0 37 46
the 0 37 46
JCPOA 0 37 46
may 0 37 46
provide 0 37 46
a 0 37 46
loophole 0 37 46
for 0 37 46
Iran 0 37 46
to 0 37 46
exploit 0 37 46

which 0 37 46
North 0 37 46
Korea 0 37 46
desperately 0 37 46
needs. 0 37 46

Proponents 0 37 48
of 0 37 48
the 0 37 48

to 0 37 48
the 0 37 48
Trump 0 37 48

kill 0 37 48
any 0 37 48

of 0 37 48

of 0 38 15
a 0 38 15
Yersinia 0 38 15

infection. 0 38 15

Although 0 38 16
the 0 38 16
black 0 38 16
plague 0 38 16
can 0 38 16
be 0 38 16
treated 0 38 16
effectively 0 38 16
with 0 38 16
antibiotics, 0 38 16
the 0 38 16
incubation 0 38 16
time 0 38 16
of 0 38 16
this 0 38 16
bacteria 0 38 16
is 0 38 16
incredibly 1 38 16
short. 0 38 16

Death 0 38 17
often 0 38 17
occurs 0 38 17
within 0 38 17
12-24 0 38 17
hours 0 38 17
of 0 38 17
becoming 0 38 17
infected. 0 38 17

The 0 38 18
bubonic 0 38 18
strain 0 38 18
of 0 38 18
the 0 38 18
disease 0 38 18

spread 0 38 18
through 0 38 18
the 0 38 18
bites 0 38 18
of 0 38 18
infected 0 38 18
fleas, 0 38 18
whereas 0 38 18

deadly 0 38 18

said 0 38 19
that 0 38 19
overcoming 0 38 19
the 0 38 19
epidemic 0 38 19
would 0 38 19
require 0 38 19
long-term 0 38 19
help, 0 38 19
not 0 38 19
“just 0 38 19
intervening 0 38 19
at 0 38 19
the 0 38 19

“It 1 38 21

Will 0 40 0
Trump 0 40 0
Continue 0 40 0
the 0 40 0
CIA’s 0 40 0
JFK 0 40 0
Cover-Up? 0 40 0

Last 0 40 1
Friday, 0 40 1
President 0 40 1
Trump 0 40 1
made 0 40 1
the 0 40 1
following 0 40 1
announcement: 0 40 1

I 0 40 2
have 0 40 2
decided 0 40 2
not 0 40 2
to 0 40 2
block 0 40 2
release 0 40 2
of 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
CIA’s 0 40 2
remaining 0 40 2
JFK-assassination 0 40 2
related 0 40 2
records 0 40 2
except 0 40 2
for 0 40 2
those 0 40 2
records 0 40 2
that 0 40 2
directly 0 40 2
implicate 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
CIA 0 40 2
in 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
assassination, 0 40 2
which 0 40 2
will 0 40 2
continue 0 40 2
to 0 40 2
remain 0 40 2
secret.” 0 40 2

Okay, 0 40 3
he 0 40 3
didn’t 0 40 3
really 0 40 3
put 0 40 3
it 0 40 3
like 0 40 3
that. 0 40 3

But 0 40 4
that’s 0 40 4
the 0 40 4
potential 0 40 4
and 0 40 4
likely 0 40 4
import 0 40 4
of 0 40 4
his 0 40 4
announcement, 0 40 4
which 0 40 4
actually 0 40 4
read 0 40 4
as 0 40 4
follows: 0 40 4

Subject 0 40 5
to 0 40 5
the 0 40 5
receipt 0 40 5
of 0 40 5
further 0 40 5
information, 0 40 5
I 0 40 5
will 0 40 5
be 0 40 5
allowing, 0 40 5
as 0 40 5
President, 0 40 5
the 0 40 5
long 0 40 5
blocked 0 40 5

FILES 0 40 5
to 0 40 5
be 0 40 5
opened.” 0 40 5
(Italics 0 40 5
added.) 0 40 5

The 0 40 6
operative 0 40 6
words, 0 40 6
of 0 40 6
course, 0 40 6
are: 0 40 6
“Subject 0 40 6
to 0 40 6
the 0 40 6
receipt 0 40 6
of 0 40 6
further 0 40 6
information….” 0 40 6

What 0 40 7
is 0 40 7
going 0 40 7
on 0 40 7
here? 0 40 7

Negotiations. 0 40 8

The 0 40 9
art 0 40 9
of 0 40 9
the 0 40 9
deal. 0 40 9

The 0 40 10
CIA 0 40 10
desperately 0 40 10
does 0 40 10
not 0 40 10
want 0 40 10
to 0 40 10
show 0 40 10
the 0 40 10
American 0 40 10
people 0 40 10
its 0 40 10
long-secret 0 40 10
JFK-related 0 40 10
records. 0 40 10

It 0 40 11
has 0 40 11
asked 0 40 11
Trump 0 40 11
to 0 40 11
continue 0 40 11
keeping 0 40 11
at 0 40 11
least 0 40 11
some 0 40 11
of 0 40 11
them 0 40 11
secret 0 40 11
notwithstanding 0 40 11
the 0 40 11
passage 0 40 11
of 0 40 11
more 0 40 11
than 0 40 11
50 0 40 11
years 0 40 11
since 0 40 11
the 0 40 11
Kennedy 0 40 11
assassination. 0 40 11

Under 0 40 12
long-established 0 40 12
custom 0 40 12
and 0 40 12
tradition 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
Washington, 0 40 12
D.C., 0 40 12
when 0 40 12
someone 0 40 12
asks 0 40 12
someone 0 40 12
else 0 40 12
for 0 40 12
a 0 40 12
favor, 0 40 12
the 0 40 12
person 0 40 12
who 0 40 12
is 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
a 0 40 12
position 0 40 12
to 0 40 12
grant 0 40 12
the 0 40 12
favor 0 40 12
demands 0 40 12
something 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
return. 0 40 12

That’s 0 40 13
where 0 40 13
the 0 40 13
negotiations 0 40 13
between 0 40 13
Trump 0 40 13
and 0 40 13
the 0 40 13
CIA 0 40 13
come 0 40 13
into 0 40 13
play. 0 40 13

Trump 0 40 14
wants 0 40 14
something 0 40 14
in 0 40 14
return. 0 40 14

We 0 40 15
don’t 0 40 15
know 0 40 15
what 0 40 15
— 0 40 15
maybe 0 40 15
laying 0 40 15
off 0 40 15
on 0 40 15
the 0 40 15
Russia 0 40 15
investigation 0 40 15
— 0 40 15
but 0 40 15
his 0 40 15
announcement 0 40 15
last 0 40 15
Friday 0 40 15
is 0 40 15
obviously 0 40 15
part 0 40 15
of 0 40 15
the 0 40 15
concluding 0 40 15
steps 0 40 15
of 0 40 15
such 0 40 15
negotiations. 0 40 15

Time 0 40 16
to 0 40 16
buy 0 40 16
old 0 40 16
US 0 40 16
gold 0 40 16
coins 0 40 16

What 0 40 17
Trump 0 40 17
has 0 40 17
done 0 40 17
with 0 40 17
his 0 40 17
announcement 0 40 17
is 0 40 17
send 0 40 17
a 0 40 17
clear 0 40 17
message 0 40 17
to 0 40 17
the 0 40 17
CIA: 0 40 17
“Give 0 40 17
me 0 40 17
what 0 40 17
I 0 40 17
want 0 40 17
and 0 40 17
I’ll 0 40 17
give 0 40 17
you 0 40 17
want 0 40 17
you 0 40 17
want. 0 40 17

Otherwise, 0 40 18
I 0 40 18
will 0 40 18
let 0 40 18
all 0 40 18
your 0 40 18
cherished 1 40 18
long-secret 1 40 18
records 1 40 18
relating 0 40 18
to 0 40 18
the 0 40 18
JFK 0 40 18
assassination 0 40 18
be 0 40 18
shown 0 40 18
to 0 40 18
the 0 40 18
American 0 40 18
people.” 0 40 18

Make 0 40 19
no 0 40 19
mistake 0 40 19
about 0 40 19
it: 0 40 19
A 0 40 19
deal 0 40 19
is 0 40 19
about 0 40 19
to 0 40 19
be 0 40 19
made. 0 40 19

The 0 40 20
CIA 0 40 20
will 0 40 20
cave. 0 40 20

It 0 40 21
will 0 40 21
end 0 40 21
up 0 40 21
giving 0 40 21
Trump 0 40 21
whatever 0 40 21
it 0 40 21
is 0 40 21
he 0 40 21
wants. 0 40 21

Trump 1 40 22
is 1 40 22
in 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
driver’s 1 40 22
seat 1 40 22
because 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
CIA 1 40 22
cannot 1 40 22
afford 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
permit 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
American 1 40 22
people 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
see 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
records 1 40 22
it 1 40 22
wants 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
continue 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
be 1 40 22
kept 1 40 22
secret. 1 40 22

And 0 40 23
once 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
CIA 1 40 23
gives 1 40 23
Trump 1 40 23
what 1 40 23
he 1 40 23
wants, 1 40 23
he 1 40 23
will 1 40 23
cave 1 40 23
and 1 40 23
give 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
CIA 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
continued 1 40 23
secrecy 1 40 23
it 1 40 23
so 1 40 23
desperately 1 40 23
needs. 1 40 23

All 0 40 24
this 0 40 24
will 0 40 24
happen 0 40 24
by 0 40 24
this 0 40 24
Thursday, 0 40 24
the 0 40 24
date 0 40 24
set 0 40 24
by 0 40 24
law 0 40 24
for 0 40 24
release 0 40 24
of 0 40 24
all 0 40 24
the 0 40 24
JFK 0 40 24
records 0 40 24
that 0 40 24
Trump 0 40 24
has 0 40 24
not 0 40 24
blocked. 0 40 24

Think 0 40 25
about 0 40 25
it: 0 40 25
The 0 40 25
CIA 0 40 25
has 0 40 25
asked 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
president 0 40 25
to 0 40 25
continue 0 40 25
secrecy 0 40 25
of 0 40 25
records 0 40 25
that 0 40 25
are 0 40 25
more 0 40 25
than 0 40 25
50 0 40 25
years 0 40 25
old 0 40 25
or, 0 40 25
apparently, 0 40 25
some 0 40 25
relating 0 40 25
to 0 40 25
secret 0 40 25
correspondence 0 40 25
between 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
CIA 0 40 25
and 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
Assassination 0 40 25
Records 0 40 25
Review 0 40 25
Board 0 40 25
back 0 40 25
in 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
1990s. 0 40 25

The 0 40 26
CIA’s 0 40 26
ground? 0 40 26

“National 0 40 27
security” 0 40 27
of 0 40 27
course, 0 40 27
the 1 40 27
two 1 40 27
most 1 40 27
important 1 40 27
and 1 40 27
meaningless 1 40 27
words 1 40 27
in 0 40 27
the 0 40 27
American 0 40 27
political 0 40 27
lexicon. 0 40 27

National 0 40 28
security? 0 40 28

Really? 0 40 29

Whatever 0 40 30
definition 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
one 0 40 30
might 0 40 30
put 0 40 30
on 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
nebulous 0 40 30
term, 0 40 30
no 1 40 30
reasonable 1 40 30
person 1 40 30
can 1 40 30
honestly 1 40 30
believe 1 40 30
that 0 40 30
the 0 40 30
release 0 40 30
of 0 40 30
50-year-old 0 40 30
records 0 40 30
are 0 40 30
going 0 40 30
to 0 40 30
result 1 40 30
in 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
United 1 40 30
States 1 40 30
falling 1 40 30
into 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
ocean 1 40 30
or 0 40 30
even 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
the 1 40 30
communists 1 40 30
are 1 40 30
going 1 40 30
to 1 40 30
take 1 40 30
over 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
federal 1 40 30
government. 1 40 30

The 0 40 31
CIA 0 40 31
says 0 40 31
that 0 40 31
releasing 0 40 31
its 0 40 31
decades-old 0 40 31
JFK 0 40 31
records 0 40 31
will 0 40 31
reveal 0 40 31
secret 0 40 31
“methods” 0 40 31
of 0 40 31
intelligence 0 40 31
gathering. 0 40 31

Really? 1 40 32

What, 1 40 33
like 1 40 33
the 1 40 33
CIA 1 40 33
was 1 40 33
using 1 40 33
typewriters 1 40 33
instead 1 40 33
of 1 40 33
computers 1 40 33
and 1 40 33
pay 1 40 33
telephones 1 40 33
instead 1 40 33
of 1 40 33
cell 1 40 33
phones? 1 40 33

What 0 40 34
is 0 40 34
amazing 0 40 34
(or 0 40 34
not) 0 40 34
is 0 40 34
the 1 40 34
extreme 1 40 34
nonchalance 1 40 34
of 0 40 34
the 0 40 34
mainstream 0 40 34
media 0 40 34
to 0 40 34
the 0 40 34
CIA’s 0 40 34
request 0 40 34
for 0 40 34
continued 0 40 34
secrecy. 0 40 34

That 0 40 35
should 0 40 35
be 0 40 35
big 0 40 35
news. 0 40 35

It’s 1 40 36
essentially 1 40 36
an 1 40 36
admission 1 40 36
of 1 40 36
guilt, 1 40 36
given 0 40 36
that 0 40 36
it 0 40 36
is 0 40 36
absolutely 1 40 36
ludicrous 1 40 36
to 0 40 36
think 0 40 36
that 0 40 36
“national 0 40 36
security” 0 40 36
would 0 40 36
be 0 40 36
threatened 0 40 36
by 0 40 36
the 0 40 36
release 0 40 36
of 0 40 36
the 0 40 36
CIA’s 0 40 36
long-secret 0 40 36
JFK-assassination-related 0 40 36
records. 0 40 36

You 0 40 37
see, 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
mainstream 0 40 37
media 0 40 37
starts 0 40 37
with 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
assumption 0 40 37
that 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
CIA 0 40 37
had 0 40 37
nothing 0 40 37
to 0 40 37
do 0 40 37
with 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
assassination. 0 40 37

In 0 40 38
their 0 40 38
minds, 0 40 38
the 0 40 38
assassination 0 40 38
was 0 40 38
committed 0 40 38
by 0 40 38
a 0 40 38
lone 1 40 38
nut 1 40 38
former 1 40 38
U.S. 1 40 38
Marine 1 40 38
communist, 1 40 38
one 0 40 38
who 0 40 38
had 0 40 38
no 0 40 38
motive 0 40 38
to 0 40 38
kill 0 40 38
the 0 40 38
president. 0 40 38

Such 0 40 39
being 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
case, 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
mainstream 0 40 39
media, 0 40 39
deferring 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
CIA, 0 40 39
automatically 0 40 39
concludes 0 40 39
that 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
wish 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
continue 0 40 39
keeping 0 40 39
secret 0 40 39
has 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
be 0 40 39
based 0 40 39
on 0 40 39
“national 0 40 39
security” 0 40 39
grounds 0 40 39
rather 0 40 39
than 0 40 39
an 0 40 39
attempt 0 40 39
by 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
CIA 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
continue 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
cover-up 0 40 39
of 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
assassination 0 40 39
of 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
president. 0 40 39

Let’s 0 40 40
proceed 0 40 40
from 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
opposite 0 40 40
assumption: 0 40 40
That 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
CIA, 0 40 40
in 0 40 40
partnership 0 40 40
with 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
military 0 40 40
and 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
Mafia, 0 40 40
orchestrated 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
assassination 0 40 40
by 0 40 40
framing 0 40 40
a 0 40 40
former 0 40 40
U.S. 0 40 40
Marine 0 40 40
who 0 40 40
was 0 40 40
then 0 40 40
working 0 40 40
for 0 40 40
U.S. 0 40 40
intelligence, 0 40 40
either 0 40 40
Navy 0 40 40
intelligence, 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
CIA, 0 40 40
or 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
FBI, 0 40 40
or 0 40 40
a 0 40 40
combination 0 40 40
of 0 40 40
all 0 40 40
three. 0 40 40

Don’t 0 40 41
forget, 0 40 41
after 0 40 41
all, 0 40 41
that 0 40 41
that’s 0 40 41
what 0 40 41
Oswald 0 40 41
said. 0 40 41

He 0 40 42
said 0 40 42
he 0 40 42
was 0 40 42
being 0 40 42
framed. 0 40 42

Yet, 0 40 43
from 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
very 0 40 43
beginning, 0 40 43
the 1 40 43
mainstream 1 40 43
media 1 40 43
has 1 40 43
never 1 40 43
given 1 40 43
any 1 40 43
serious 1 40 43
consideration 1 40 43
to 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
possibility 0 40 43
that 0 40 43
Oswald 0 40 43
was 0 40 43
framed 0 40 43
for 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
crime. 0 40 43

Instead, 0 40 44
they 0 40 44
have 0 40 44
steadfastly 0 40 44
stuck 0 40 44
with 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
official 0 40 44
story, 0 40 44
one 0 40 44
that 0 40 44
has 0 40 44
all 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
characteristics 0 40 44
of 0 40 44
a 0 40 44
pat 1 40 44
frame-up: 1 40 44
That 0 40 44
Oswald 0 40 44
acted 0 40 44
alone 0 40 44
or 0 40 44
possibly 0 40 44
acted 0 40 44
in 0 40 44
concert 0 40 44
with 0 40 44
others, 0 40 44
both 0 40 44
of 0 40 44
which 0 40 44
lead 0 40 44
to 0 40 44
nothing 0 40 44
but 0 40 44
dead 0 40 44
ends, 0 40 44
contradictions, 0 40 44
and 0 40 44
anomalies. 0 40 44

Now, 0 40 45
let’s 0 40 45
assume 0 40 45
instead 0 40 45
that 0 40 45
Oswald 0 40 45
was 0 40 45
telling 0 40 45
the 0 40 45
truth 0 40 45
when 0 40 45
he 0 40 45
said 0 40 45
he 0 40 45
was 0 40 45
being 0 40 45
framed. 0 40 45

In 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
case, 0 40 46
it 0 40 46
would 0 40 46
be 0 40 46
imperative 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
CIA 0 40 46
and 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
military 0 40 46
keep 0 40 46
as 0 40 46
tight 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
lid 0 40 46
on 0 40 46
their 0 40 46
records 0 40 46
as 0 40 46
possible 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
ensure 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
investigators 0 40 46
or 0 40 46
investigative 0 40 46
reporters 0 40 46
would 0 40 46
have 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
difficult 0 40 46
time 0 40 46
piercing 0 40 46
through 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
circumstantial 0 40 46
evidence 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
establishes 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
frame-up. 0 40 46

As 0 40 47
part 0 40 47
of 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
frame-up, 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
CIA 0 40 47
would 0 40 47
have 0 40 47
to 0 40 47
fortify 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
persona 0 40 47
of 0 40 47
Oswald, 0 40 47
its 0 40 47
intelligence 0 40 47
agent, 0 40 47
as 0 40 47
a 0 40 47
purported 1 40 47
communist. 1 40 47

That 1 40 48
would 1 40 48
enable 1 40 48
the 1 40 48
CIA 1 40 48
to 1 40 48
blame 1 40 48
the 1 40 48
assassination 1 40 48
on 1 40 48
a 1 40 48
communist, 1 40 48
which, 0 40 48
not 0 40 48
coincidentally, 0 40 48
was 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
advice 0 40 48
that 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
Pentagon 0 40 48
and 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
CIA 0 40 48
were 0 40 48
doling 0 40 48
out 0 40 48
to 0 40 48
Latin 0 40 48
American 0 40 48
military 0 40 48
dictatorships 0 40 48
at 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
School 0 40 48
of 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
Americas. 0 40 48

In 0 40 49
cases 0 40 49
of 0 40 49
covert 0 40 49
state-sponsored 0 40 49
assassinations, 0 40 49
Latin 0 40 49
American 0 40 49
regimes 0 40 49
were 0 40 49
taught, 0 40 49
a 1 40 49
good 1 40 49
strategy 1 40 49
was 1 40 49
to 1 40 49
blame 1 40 49
the 1 40 49
assassination 1 40 49
on 1 40 49
a 1 40 49
communist 1 40 49
because 1 40 49
then 1 40 49
they 1 40 49
could 1 40 49
smear 1 40 49
anyone 1 40 49
who 1 40 49
challenged 1 40 49
the 1 40 49
official 1 40 49
story 1 40 49
as 1 40 49
a 1 40 49
communist 1 40 49
sympathizer. 1 40 49

It 0 40 50
would 0 40 50
also 0 40 50
explain 0 40 50
why 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
CIA 0 40 50
was 0 40 50
closely 0 40 50
monitoring 0 40 50
Oswald’s 0 40 50
movements 0 40 50
prior 0 40 50
to 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
assassination, 0 40 50
something 0 40 50
else 0 40 50
that 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
CIA 0 40 50
kept 0 40 50
secret 0 40 50
for 0 40 50
decades. 0 40 50

They 1 40 51
had 1 40 51
to 1 40 51
make 1 40 51
certain 1 40 51
that 1 40 51
Oswald 1 40 51
was 1 40 51
not 1 40 51
on 1 40 51
to 1 40 51
them 1 40 51
and 1 40 51
had 1 40 51
not 1 40 51
discovered 1 40 51
that 1 40 51
he 1 40 51
was 1 40 51
being 1 40 51
set 1 40 51
up 1 40 51
for 1 40 51
a 1 40 51
frame-up. 1 40 51

The 0 40 52
first 0 40 52
organization 0 40 52
that 0 40 52
came 0 40 52
out 0 40 52
with 0 40 52
a 0 40 52
press 0 40 52
release 0 40 52
advertising 0 40 52
Oswald’s 0 40 52
bona 0 40 52
fides 0 40 52
was 0 40 52
the 0 40 52
DRE, 0 40 52
an 0 40 52
anti-communist 0 40 52
group 0 40 52
in 0 40 52
New 0 40 52
Orleans 0 40 52
with 0 40 52
which 0 40 52
Oswald 0 40 52
had 0 40 52
had 0 40 52
contact. 0 40 52

What 0 40 53
no 0 40 53
one 0 40 53
knew 0 40 53
at 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
time, 0 40 53
and 0 40 53
what 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
CIA 0 40 53
intentionally 0 40 53
kept 0 40 53
secret 0 40 53
for 0 40 53
decades, 0 40 53
was 0 40 53
that 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
DRE 0 40 53
was 0 40 53
a 0 40 53
CIA 0 40 53
front 0 40 53
organization. 0 40 53

It 0 40 54
was 0 40 54
being 0 40 54
generously 0 40 54
funded 0 40 54
by 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
and 0 40 54
controlled 0 40 54
by 0 40 54
a 0 40 54
secret 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
agent 0 40 54
named 0 40 54
George 0 40 54
Joannides, 0 40 54
which 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
would 0 40 54
intentionally 0 40 54
keep 0 40 54
secret 0 40 54
from 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
Warren 0 40 54
Commission 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1960s, 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
House 0 40 54
Select 0 40 54
Committee 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1970s, 0 40 54
and 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
Assassination 0 40 54
Records 0 40 54
Review 0 40 54
Board 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1990s. 0 40 54

But 0 40 55
there 0 40 55
was 0 40 55
another 0 40 55
big 0 40 55
operation 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
establish 0 40 55
Oswald’s 0 40 55
communist 0 40 55
bona 0 40 55
fides 0 40 55
before 0 40 55
the 0 40 55
assassination. 0 40 55

It 0 40 56
had 0 40 56
to 0 40 56
do 0 40 56
with 0 40 56
Oswald’s 0 40 56
trip 0 40 56
to 0 40 56
Mexico 0 40 56
City, 0 40 56
where 0 40 56
he 0 40 56
visited 0 40 56
the 0 40 56
Cuban 0 40 56
and 0 40 56
Soviet 0 40 56
embassies. 0 40 56

Something 1 40 57
dreadful 1 40 57
obviously 0 40 57
went 0 40 57
wrong 0 40 57
with 0 40 57
that 0 40 57
part 0 40 57
of 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
operation 0 40 57
because 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
official 0 40 57
investigation 0 40 57
into 0 40 57
it 0 40 57
was 0 40 57
quickly 0 40 57
shut 0 40 57
down 0 40 57
during 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
early 0 40 57
post-assassination 0 40 57
period. 0 40 57

Today, 0 40 58
Oswald’s 0 40 58
Mexico 0 40 58
City 0 40 58
trip, 0 40 58
which 0 40 58
is 0 40 58
part 0 40 58
of 0 40 58
those 0 40 58
CIA 0 40 58
records 0 40 58
ready 0 40 58
to 0 40 58
be 0 40 58
released, 0 40 58
is 0 40 58
still 0 40 58
shrouded 0 40 58
in 0 40 58
mystery. 0 40 58

The 0 40 59
CIA’s 0 40 59
continued 0 40 59
secrecy 0 40 59
in 0 40 59
the 0 40 59
JFK 0 40 59
assassination 0 40 59
is 0 40 59
no 0 40 59
big 0 40 59
surprise. 0 40 59

As 0 40 60
I 0 40 60
wrote 0 40 60
in 0 40 60
my 0 40 60
October 0 40 60
11 0 40 60
article, 0 40 60
“Will 0 40 60
Trump 0 40 60

the 0 40 60
CIA 0 40 60

between 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
rock 0 40 60
and 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
hard 0 40 60
place. 0 40 60

On 0 40 61
the 0 40 61
one 0 40 61
hand, 0 40 61
it 1 40 61
knows 1 40 61
that 1 40 61
those 1 40 61

On 0 40 62
the 0 40 62
other 0 40 62
hand, 0 40 62
it 0 40 62
knows 0 40 62
that 0 40 62
by 1 40 62
seeking 1 40 62
continued 1 40 62
secrecy, 1 40 62
it’s 1 40 62
essentially 1 40 62
an 1 40 62
implicit 1 40 62
acknowledgment 1 40 62
of 1 40 62
guilt. 1 40 62

Not 0 40 63
surprisingly, 0 40 63
it 0 40 63
is 0 40 63
choosing 0 40 63
the 0 40 63
latter 0 40 63
course, 0 40 63
especially 0 40 63
because 1 40 63
it 1 40 63
knows 1 40 63
that 1 40 63
its 1 40 63
assets 1 40 63
and 1 40 63
allies 1 40 63
in 1 40 63
the 1 40 63
mainstream 1 40 63
press 1 40 63
will 1 40 63
continue 1 40 63
to 1 40 63
come 1 40 63
to 1 40 63
its 1 40 63
defense 1 40 63
with 0 40 63
respect 0 40 63
to 0 40 63
its 0 40 63
ridiculous 0 40 63
claim 0 40 63
of 0 40 63
“national 0 40 63
security.” 0 40 63

Do 0 40 64
the 0 40 64
CIA’s 0 40 64
long-secret 0 40 64
records 0 40 64
contain 0 40 64
a 0 40 64
video-taped 0 40 64
confession? 0 40 64

Of 0 40 65
course 0 40 65
not. 0 40 65

And 0 40 66
they 0 40 66
don’t 0 40 66
contain 0 40 66
any 0 40 66
reference 0 40 66
to 0 40 66
assassinating 0 40 66
Kennedy. 0 40 66

The 0 40 67
CIA’s 0 40 67
practice 0 40 67
from 0 40 67
the 0 40 67
very 0 40 67
beginning 0 40 67
has 0 40 67
been 0 40 67
to 0 40 67
not 0 40 67
put 0 40 67
any 0 40 67
reference 0 40 67
to 0 40 67
a 0 40 67
state-sponsored 0 40 67
assassination 0 40 67
into 0 40 67
writing. 0 40 67

But 0 40 68
there 0 40 68
has 0 40 68
to 0 40 68
be 0 40 68
a 0 40 68
reason 0 40 68
why 0 40 68
the 0 40 68
CIA 0 40 68
chose 0 40 68
to 0 40 68
keep 0 40 68
this 0 40 68
particular 0 40 68
batch 0 40 68
of 0 40 68
records 0 40 68
secret 0 40 68
for 0 40 68
more 0 40 68
than 0 40 68
50 0 40 68
years. 0 40 68

Those 0 40 69
long-secret 0 40 69
records 0 40 69
undoubtedly 0 40 69
include 0 40 69
small 0 40 69
bits 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
important 0 40 69
circumstantial 0 40 69
evidence 0 40 69
that 0 40 69
fill 0 40 69
out 0 40 69
even 0 40 69
further 0 40 69
the 0 40 69
mosaic 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
a 0 40 69
regime-change 0 40 69
operation 0 40 69
that 0 40 69
took 0 40 69
place 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
Dallas 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
November 0 40 69
1963, 0 40 69
the 0 40 69
same 0 40 69
types 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
regime-change 0 40 69
operation 0 40 69
that 0 40 69
took 0 40 69
place 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
Iran 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1953, 0 40 69

1961, 0 40 69
and 0 40 69
Chile 0 40 69
in 0 40 69
1973, 0 40 69
all 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
which 0 40 69
the 1 40 69
CIA 1 40 69
steadfastly 1 40 69
kept 1 40 69
secret 1 40 69
from 1 40 69
the 1 40 69
American 1 40 69
people. 1 40 69

In 0 40 70
1953, 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
CIA 0 40 70
was 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
process 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
developing 0 40 70
a 0 40 70
top-secret 0 40 70
manual 0 40 70
on 0 40 70
assassinations, 0 40 70
one 0 40 70
that 0 40 70
showed 0 40 70
that 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
CIA 0 40 70
was 0 40 70
specializing 0 40 70
not 0 40 70
only 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
art 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
assassination 0 40 70
but 0 40 70
also 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
art 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
covering 0 40 70
up 0 40 70
its 0 40 70
role 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
state-sponsored 0 40 70
assassinations. 0 40 70

Every 1 40 71
American 1 40 71
owes 1 40 71
it 1 40 71
to 1 40 71
himself 1 40 71
to 1 40 71
read 1 40 71
that 1 40 71
manual. 1 40 71

Too 0 40 72
bad 0 40 72
the 0 40 72
mainstream 0 40 72
press 0 40 72
has 0 40 72
never 0 40 72
given 0 40 72
that 0 40 72
manual 0 40 72
the 0 40 72
consideration 0 40 72
it 0 40 72
deserves. 0 40 72

If 0 40 73
it 0 40 73
did, 0 40 73
it 0 40 73
might 0 40 73
not 0 40 73
be 0 40 73
so 0 40 73
deferential 0 40 73
to 0 40 73
the 0 40 73

that 0 40 73
Trump 0 40 73

many 0 41 4
speculate 0 41 4
that 0 41 4

“With 0 43 7
anything 0 43 7

there 0 43 7
is 0 43 7
a 0 43 7

prevent 0 43 8
its 0 43 8

The 0 43 9
outbreak 0 43 9
is 0 43 9
considered 0 43 9
a 0 43 9
much 0 43 9
bigger 0 43 9
threat 0 43 9
to 0 43 9
the 0 43 9

than 0 43 9
in 0 43 9
previous 0 43 9
years 0 43 9
because 0 43 9
it 0 43 9
has 0 43 9
taken 0 43 9

its 0 43 9
pneumonic 0 43 9

That 0 43 10
means 0 43 10
it 0 43 10

that, 0 43 11

the 0 43 11

a 0 43 11

Once 0 43 12

Experts 0 43 13

the 1 43 13
epidemic 1 43 13

“We 0 43 16
don’t 0 43 16
want 0 43 16

situation 0 43 16
where 0 43 16
the 0 43 16

Most 0 43 17
of 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
cases 0 43 17
in 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
past 0 43 17

been 0 43 17
of 0 43 17
the 0 43 17

if 0 43 17
you 0 43 17
look 0 43 17
at 0 43 17
this 0 43 17
particular 0 43 17
outbreak, 0 43 17
70 0 43 17
percent 0 43 17
of 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
cases 0 43 17
are 0 43 17
pneumonic 0 43 17
plague, 0 43 17
which 0 43 17
is 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
most 0 43 17
deadly 0 43 17
form 0 43 17
of 0 43 17
the 0 43 17
disease. 0 43 17

If 1 43 18
the 1 43 18
treatment 1 43 18
is 1 43 18
not 1 43 18
given 1 43 18

a 1 43 18
very 1 43 18

these 1 43 18

up 1 43 18

Both 0 43 18

forms 0 43 18

of 0 43 18

the 0 43 18

can 0 43 18

The 0 62 7
ratification 0 62 7
vote 0 62 7
is 0 62 7
typically 0 62 7
a 0 62 7
mere 0 62 7
formality, 0 62 7
but 0 62 7
Monday’s 0 62 7
was 0 62 7
different 0 62 7
due 0 62 7
to 0 62 7

Student 0 62 7
Society 0 62 7
of 0 62 7
McGill 0 62 7
University 0 62 7

an 0 62 7
organization 0 62 7
that 0 62 7
was 0 62 7

to 0 62 7

Democratize 0 62 8
SSMU 0 62 8
was 0 62 8
able 0 62 8
to 0 62 8
pass 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
motion 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
required 0 62 8
each 0 62 8
board 0 62 8

to 0 62 8
be 0 62 8
voted 0 62 8
upon 0 62 8
separately 0 62 8
under 0 62 8
the 0 62 8
grounds 0 62 8
that 0 62 8
they 0 62 8
weren’t 0 62 8
a 0 62 8
fan 0 62 8
of 0 62 8
the 0 62 8

When 0 62 9
it 0 62 9
was 0 62 9
Lew’s 0 62 9
turn, 0 62 9
he 0 62 9

Two 0 62 10

were 0 62 10
also 0 62 10
voted 0 62 10
down. 0 62 10

Democratize 0 62 11
SSMU 0 62 11
had 0 62 11
targeted 0 62 11
Lew 0 62 11
and 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
other 0 62 11
two 0 62 11
students 0 62 11
on 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
board 0 62 11
because 0 62 11
they 0 62 11
had 0 62 11
connections 0 62 11
to 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
Canadian 0 62 11
Jewish 0 62 11
Political 0 62 11
Affairs 0 62 11
Committee 0 62 11
(CJPAC) 0 62 11
and 0 62 11
were 0 62 11
involved 0 62 11
in 0 62 11
getting 0 62 11
the 0 62 11
BDS 0 62 11
ban 0 62 11
passed, 0 62 11
which 0 62 11
Democratize 0 62 11
SSMU 0 62 11
claimed 0 62 11
were 0 62 11
“conflicts 0 62 11
of 0 62 11
interests.” 0 62 11

Somehow 0 62 12
I 0 62 12
don't 0 62 12
think 0 62 12
being 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
member 0 62 12
of 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
Muslim 0 62 12
student 0 62 12
group 0 62 12
and 0 62 12
supporting 0 62 12
BDS 0 62 12
would 0 62 12
be 0 62 12
considered 0 62 12
a 0 62 12
conflict 0 62 12
of 0 62 12
interest. 0 62 12

But 0 62 13
the 1 62 13
campus 1 62 13
anti-Israel 1 62 13
crowd 1 62 13
has 0 62 13
been 0 62 13
working 0 62 13
rather 0 62 13
hard 0 62 13
to 0 62 13
intimidate 0 62 13
and 0 62 13
penalize 0 62 13
anyone 0 62 13
involved 0 62 13
in 0 62 13
pro-Israel 0 62 13
organizations. 0 62 13

And 0 62 14
to 0 62 14
keep 0 62 14
their 0 62 14
racist 1 62 14
boycott 1 62 14
movement 1 62 14
going 0 62 14
by 0 62 14
maintaining 0 62 14
control 0 62 14
over 0 62 14
student 0 62 14
governments. 0 62 14

Lew 0 62 15
shared 0 62 15
the 0 62 15
experience 0 62 15
on 0 62 15
Facebook. 0 62 15

“I 0 62 16
have 1 62 16

the 1 62 16

me 1 62 16
prior 1 62 16
to 1 62 16
this 1 62 16
vote 1 62 16
that 1 62 16
this 1 62 16
was 1 62 16
about 1 62 16
my 1 62 16

nothing 1 62 16
more,” 1 62 16

“I 0 62 17

Lew 0 62 17
added 0 62 17
that 0 62 17
the 0 62 17

inherent 0 62 17
anti-Semitism 0 62 17
in 0 62 17
the 0 62 17

movement. 0 62 17

“If 0 62 18

not 0 62 18

“If 1 62 19

On 0 62 21
Monday 0 62 21
night, 0 62 21
three 0 62 21
students 0 62 21
were 0 62 21
removed 0 62 21
from 0 62 21
the 0 62 21
Board 0 62 21
of 0 62 21

main 0 62 21
student 0 62 21
government. 0 62 21

All 0 62 22
three 0 62 22
were 0 62 22
targeted 0 62 22
for 0 62 22
removal 0 62 22
either 0 62 22
because 0 62 22
they 0 62 22
are 0 62 22
Jewish 0 62 22
or 0 62 22
have 0 62 22
vocally 0 62 22
opposed 0 62 22
anti-Jewish 0 62 22
discrimination 0 62 22
on 0 62 22
campus. 0 62 22

This 0 62 23
episode 0 62 23
is 0 62 23
utterly 1 62 23
unacceptable, 1 62 23
and 0 62 23
is 0 62 23
merely 0 62 23
the 0 62 23
latest 0 62 23
in 0 62 23
a 0 62 23
long 0 62 23
string 0 62 23
of 0 62 23
antisemitic 0 62 23
incidents 0 62 23
at 0 62 23
your 0 62 23
university. 0 62 23

Indeed, 0 62 24
according 0 62 24
to 0 62 24
eyewitnesses, 0 62 24
one 0 62 24
of 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
members 0 62 24
of 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
mob 0 62 24
that 0 62 24
removed 0 62 24
the 0 62 24
three 0 62 24
directors 0 62 24
was 0 62 24
Igor 0 62 24
Sadikov. 0 62 24

You 0 62 25
will 0 62 25
remember 0 62 25
Sadikov 0 62 25
as 0 62 25
the 0 62 25
student 0 62 25
politician 0 62 25
who 0 62 25
in 0 62 25
February 0 62 25
told 0 62 25
his 0 62 25
followers 0 62 25
to 0 62 25
“punch 1 62 25
a 1 62 25
Zionist 1 62 25
today.” 1 62 25
It 0 62 25
is 0 62 25
unclear 0 62 25
whether 0 62 25
Sadikov 0 62 25
has 0 62 25
faced 0 62 25
any 0 62 25
disciplinary 0 62 25
action 0 62 25
for 0 62 25
this 0 62 25
incitement 0 62 25
to 0 62 25
violence 0 62 25
from 0 62 25
your 0 62 25
administration. 0 62 25

Antisemitism 0 62 26
at 0 62 26
McGill 0 62 26
does 0 62 26
not 0 62 26
emerge 0 62 26
from 0 62 26
a 0 62 26
vacuum. 0 62 26

Rather, 0 62 27
it 0 62 27
has 0 62 27
been 0 62 27
nurtured 0 62 27
in 0 62 27
part 0 62 27
by 0 62 27
a 1 62 27
toxic 1 62 27
campus 1 62 27
press, 1 62 27
especially 0 62 27
the 0 62 27
McGill 0 62 27
Daily, 0 62 27
a 0 62 27
publication 0 62 27
which 0 62 27
openly 0 62 27
refuses 0 62 27
to 0 62 27
publish 0 62 27
any 0 62 27
“Zionist” 0 62 27
content. 0 62 27

In 0 62 28
practice, 0 62 28
this 0 62 28
prevents 0 62 28
McGill’s 0 62 28
Jewish 0 62 28
community 0 62 28
from 0 62 28
defending 0 62 28
itself 0 62 28
against 0 62 28
the 1 62 28
absurd 1 62 28
attacks 1 62 28
to 0 62 28
which 0 62 28
it 0 62 28
is 0 62 28
subjected. 0 62 28

If 0 62 29
the 0 62 29
Daily 0 62 29
is 0 62 29
committed 0 62 29
to 0 62 29
systematically 0 62 29
excluding 0 62 29
the 0 62 29
voices 0 62 29
of 0 62 29
an 0 62 29
ethno-religious 0 62 29

Khweis 0 48 3
is 0 48 3
an 0 48 3
interesting 0 48 3
case 0 48 3
for 0 48 3
numerous 0 48 3
reasons. 0 48 3

First, 0 48 4
there 0 48 4
was 0 48 4
no 0 48 4
particular 0 48 4
event 0 48 4
or 0 48 4
friend 0 48 4
who 0 48 4
ignited 0 48 4
his 0 48 4
radicalization. 0 48 4

Second, 0 48 5
he 0 48 5
successfully 0 48 5
made 0 48 5
it 0 48 5
to 0 48 5
Syria 0 48 5
via 0 48 5
Turkey. 0 48 5

And 0 48 6
third, 0 48 6
he 0 48 6
came 0 48 6
from 0 48 6
a 0 48 6
secular 0 48 6
home 0 48 6
that 0 48 6
was 0 48 6
stable. 0 48 6

His 0 48 7
life 0 48 7
before 0 48 7
joining 0 48 7
the 0 48 7
caliphate 0 48 7
was 0 48 7
unremarkable. 0 48 7

He 0 48 8
obtained 0 48 8
an 0 48 8
associate’s 0 48 8
degree 0 48 8
in 0 48 8
criminal 0 48 8

a 0 48 8

driver 0 48 8
in 0 48 8

At 0 49 40
least 0 49 40
twice 0 49 40
this 0 49 40
week, 0 49 40
the 0 49 40
Las 0 49 40
Vegas 0 49 40
Review-Journal 0 49 40
has 0 49 40
asked 0 49 40
to 0 49 40
speak 0 49 40
with 0 49 40
Sheriff 0 49 40
Joe 0 49 40
Lombardo 0 49 40
about 0 49 40
the 0 49 40
shooting 0 49 40
investigation. 0 49 40

Both 0 49 41
times, 0 49 41
reporters 0 49 41
were 0 49 41
told 0 49 41
by 0 49 41
Carla 0 49 41
Alston, 0 49 41
the 0 49 41
Police 0 49 41
Department’s 0 49 41
director 0 49 41
of 0 49 41
communications, 0 49 41
that 0 49 41
the 0 49 41
sheriff 0 49 41
“will 0 49 41
not 0 49 41
be 0 49 41
conducting 0 49 41
interviews.” 0 49 41
“As 0 49 41
he 0 49 41
has 0 49 41
stated 0 49 41
previously, 0 49 41
the 0 49 41
case 0 49 41
is 0 49 41
still 0 49 41
ongoing” 0 49 41
she 0 49 41
said 0 49 41
in 0 49 41
an 0 49 41
email 0 49 41
Thursday. 0 49 41

“Another 0 49 42
media 0 49 42
briefing 0 49 42
will 0 49 42
be 0 49 42
held 0 49 42
when 0 49 42
we 0 49 42
have 0 49 42
new 0 49 42
and 0 49 42
accurate 0 49 42
information.” 0 49 42
When 0 49 42
asked 0 49 42
when 0 49 42
that 0 49 42
briefing 0 49 42
would 0 49 42
be, 0 49 42
Alston 0 49 42
guessed 0 49 42
it 0 49 42
could 0 49 42
occur 0 49 42
in 0 49 42
the 0 49 42
next 0 49 42
two 0 49 42
weeks. 0 49 42

The 0 49 43
Review-Journal 0 49 43
also 0 49 43
specifically 0 49 43
asked 0 49 43
about 0 49 43
the 0 49 43
more 0 49 43
than 0 49 43
50,000 0 49 43
hours 0 49 43
of 0 49 43
overtime 0 49 43
that 0 49 43
Metro 0 49 43
officers 0 49 43
have 0 49 43
logged 0 49 43
since 0 49 43
Oct. 0 49 43
1 0 49 43
on 0 49 43
work 0 49 43
directly 0 49 43
related 0 49 43
to 0 49 43
the 0 49 43
shooting 0 49 43
investigation. 0 49 43

“Investigators 0 49 44
have 0 49 44
made 0 49 44
progress 0 49 44
on 0 49 44
investigative 0 49 44

the 0 49 44
last 0 49 44
few 0 49 44
years 0 49 44
— 0 49 44
and 0 49 44
they’re 0 49 44
still 0 49 44
not 0 49 44
done,” 0 49 44
Alston 0 49 44
said. 0 49 44

“We 0 49 45
still 0 49 45
have 0 49 45
officers 0 49 45
dedicated 0 49 45
to 0 49 45
this 0 49 45
case 0 49 45
24/7.” 0 49 45
She 0 49 45
agreed 0 49 45
that 0 49 45
members 0 49 45
of 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
public 0 49 45
have 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
right 0 49 45
to 0 49 45
know 0 49 45
more, 0 49 45
“but 0 49 45
they 0 49 45
have 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
right 0 49 45
to 0 49 45
accurate 0 49 45
information 0 49 45
and 0 49 45
not 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
speculation 0 49 45
… 0 49 45
that 0 49 45
has 0 49 45
filled 0 49 45
so 0 49 45
many 0 49 45
news 0 49 45
stories 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
past 0 49 45
month.” 0 49 45
Nearly 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
month 0 49 45
after 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
mass 0 49 45
shooting, 0 49 45
the 0 49 45
gunman’s 0 49 45
motive 0 49 45
remains 0 49 45
a 0 49 45
mystery. 0 49 45

More 0 49 46
straightforward 0 49 46
questions 0 49 46
also 0 49 46
remain 0 49 46
unanswered, 0 49 46
including 0 49 46
whether 0 49 46
the 0 49 46
32nd 0 49 46
floor 0 49 46
of 0 49 46
Mandalay 0 49 46
Bay 0 49 46
— 0 49 46
where 0 49 46
the 0 49 46
gunman 0 49 46
was 0 49 46
staying 0 49 46
— 0 49 46
has 0 49 46
surveillance 0 49 46
cameras, 0 49 46
and 0 49 46
what 0 49 46
exactly 0 49 46
investigators 0 49 46
collected 0 49 46
in 0 49 46
the 0 49 46
gunman’s 0 49 46
hotel 0 49 46
room 0 49 46
and 0 49 46
homes. 0 49 46

Authorities 0 49 47
also 0 49 47
have 0 49 47
not 0 49 47
said 0 49 47
how 0 49 47
long 0 49 47
the 0 49 47
gunman 0 49 47
had 0 49 47
a 0 49 47
“do 0 49 47
not 0 49 47
disturb” 0 49 47
sign 0 49 47
on 0 49 47
his 0 49 47
hotel 0 49 47
door, 0 49 47
and 0 49 47
whether 0 49 47
hotel 0 49 47
staff 0 49 47
saw 0 49 47
something 0 49 47
suspicious 0 49 47
in 0 49 47
his 0 49 47
room 0 49 47
but 0 49 47
failed 0 49 47
to 0 49 47
report 0 49 47
it. 0 49 47

Though 0 49 48
authorities 0 49 48
have 0 49 48
described 0 49 48
the 0 49 48
investigation 0 49 48

At 0 50 9
a 0 50 9
Friday 0 50 9
hearing, 0 50 9
Saris 0 50 9
expressed 0 50 9
concern 0 50 9
that 0 50 9
ICE 0 50 9
had 0 50 9
broken 0 50 9
its 0 50 9
word 0 50 9
with 0 50 9
Rombot 0 50 9
after 0 50 9
telling 0 50 9
him 0 50 9
in 0 50 9
2015 0 50 9
that 0 50 9
he 0 50 9
would 0 50 9
"be 0 50 9
given 0 50 9
an 0 50 9
opportunity 0 50 9
to 0 50 9
prepare 0 50 9
for 0 50 9
an 0 50 9
orderly 0 50 9
departure" 0 50 9
before 0 50 9
being 0 50 9
deported. 0 50 9

She 0 50 10
also 0 50 10
expressed 0 50 10
concern 0 50 10
he 0 50 10
was 0 50 10
being 0 50 10
held 0 50 10
alongside 0 50 10
potentially 0 50 10
violent 0 50 10
criminals. 0 50 10

Her 0 50 11
problem 0 50 11
though 0 50 11
was 0 50 11
that 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
law 0 50 11
and 0 50 11
precedent 0 50 11
are 0 50 11
on 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
side 0 50 11
of 0 50 11
the 0 50 11
continued 0 50 11
deportation 0 50 11
of 0 50 11
aliens. 0 50 11

Kritarch 0 50 12
Saris 0 50 12
has 0 50 12
apparently 0 50 12
seen 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
SCOTUS 0 50 12
writing 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
wall, 0 50 12
and 0 50 12
perhaps 0 50 12
had 1 50 12
an 1 50 12
attack 1 50 12
of 1 50 12
her 1 50 12
legal 1 50 12
conscience 1 50 12
and 0 50 12
decided 0 50 12
that 0 50 12
she 0 50 12
will 0 50 12
acquiesce 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
the 0 50 12
major 0 50 12
issue, 0 50 12
but 0 50 12
fight 0 50 12
on 0 50 12
a 0 50 12
minor 0 50 12
issue. 0 50 12

this 0 50 13
the 0 50 13
pattern 0 50 13
of 0 50 13

Saris 0 50 14
has 0 50 14
apparently 0 50 14
decided 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
bend 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
inevitable 0 50 14
in 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
case 0 50 14
of 0 50 14
Indonesians, 0 50 14
who 0 50 14
had 0 50 14
years 0 50 14
of 0 50 14
hearings 0 50 14
and 0 50 14
appeals, 0 50 14
all 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
naught, 0 50 14
but 0 50 14
do 0 50 14
a 0 50 14
little 0 50 14
sabotage 0 50 14
instead.However, 0 50 14
she 1 50 14
will 1 50 14
not 1 50 14
let 1 50 14
it 1 50 14
go 1 50 14
quietly 1 50 14
into 1 50 14
the 1 50 14
night.What 1 50 14
we 0 50 14
have 0 50 14
here 0 50 14
is 0 50 14
that 0 50 14
Saris 0 50 14
realized 0 50 14
she 0 50 14
has 0 50 14
no 0 50 14
authority 0 50 14
over 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
deportation 0 50 14
of 0 50 14
illegal 1 50 14
aliens, 1 50 14
but 0 50 14
she 0 50 14
will 0 50 14
do 0 50 14
her 0 50 14
best 0 50 14
to 0 50 14
throw 1 50 14
a 1 50 14
wrench 1 50 14
in 0 50 14

to 0 50 14
get 0 50 14
illegal 1 50 14
aliens 1 50 14
released 0 50 14
from 0 50 14
custody, 0 50 14
so 0 50 14
they 0 50 14
can 0 50 14
then 0 50 14
disappear 0 50 14
into 0 50 14
the 0 50 14
United 0 50 14

consequently 0 50 14
not 0 50 14
be 0 50 14

the 0 51 2
worst 0 51 2
news 0 51 2
is 0 51 2
that 0 51 2
the 1 51 2

of 0 51 3
the 0 51 3

But 0 51 4
the 0 51 4

The 0 51 5
rainy 0 51 5

to 0 51 5
the 0 51 5
containment 0 51 5
of 0 51 5
the 0 51 5

because 0 51 5
outbreaks 0 51 5

this 0 51 5
magnitude 0 51 5
often 0 51 5
seem 0 51 5

seasonal. 0 51 5

The 0 51 6
Foreign 0 51 6
Office 0 51 6
recently 0 51 6
warned 0 51 6
that 0 51 6

is 1 51 6
entering 1 51 6
its 1 51 6
most 1 51 6
dangerous 1 51 6
phase. 1 51 6

Its 0 51 7
website 0 51 7
said 0 51 7
that 0 51 7
“outbreaks 0 51 7
of 0 51 7

tend 0 51 7
to 0 51 7

and 0 51 7
occur 0 51 7
mainly 0 51 7
during 0 51 7
the 0 51 7

season.” 0 51 7
The 0 51 7
African 0 51 7
island’s 0 51 7
wet 0 51 7
season 0 51 7
officially 0 51 7
began 0 51 7
today 0 51 7
and 0 51 7
will 0 51 7
last 0 51 7
until 0 51 7
the 0 51 7
end 0 51 7
of 0 51 7
April, 0 51 7
meaning 0 51 7
the 1 51 7
downward 1 51 7
trend 1 51 7
the 1 51 7

had 1 51 7

likely 1 51 7
turn 1 51 7

again. 1 51 7

Because 0 51 8
the 0 51 8
disease 0 51 8

precaution. 0 51 10

The 1 51 11
outbreak 1 51 11
has 1 51 11
been 1 51 11
fueled 1 51 11
by 1 51 11
performing 1 51 11
the 1 51 11
ancient 1 51 11
practice 1 51 11
of 1 51 11

Famadihana 0 51 12
is 0 51 12
the 0 51 12
“dancing 0 51 12

a 0 51 13

because 0 51 13
they 0 51 13
contracted 0 51 13
the 0 51 13

It 0 52 3
took 0 52 3
a 0 52 3
matter 0 52 3
of 0 52 3
hours 0 52 3
for 0 52 3
the 0 52 3

to 0 52 3

the 0 52 3
Catholic 0 52 3
Faith 0 52 3
and 0 52 3
faithful. 0 52 3

Or 0 52 4
at 0 52 4
least 0 52 4
to 0 52 4
stop 0 52 4
attacking 0 52 4
them. 0 52 4

In 0 52 5
a 0 52 5
letter 0 52 5
made 0 52 5
public 0 52 5
November 0 52 5
1st, 0 52 5
Fr. 0 52 5

Weinandy, 0 52 6
a 0 52 6
former 0 52 6
chief 0 52 6
of 0 52 6
staff 0 52 6
for 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
U.S. 0 52 6
Bishops’ 0 52 6
Committee 0 52 6
on 0 52 6
Doctrine 0 52 6
and 0 52 6
a 0 52 6
member 0 52 6
of 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
Vatican’s 0 52 6
International 0 52 6
Theological 0 52 6
Commission, 0 52 6
warned 0 52 6
Pope 0 52 6
Francis 0 52 6
that 0 52 6
he 0 52 6
has 0 52 6
caused 0 52 6
“chronic 0 52 6
confusion” 0 52 6
among 0 52 6
the 0 52 6
faithful 0 52 6
and 0 52 6
bishops. 0 52 6

He 0 52 7
wrote 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
the 0 52 7
pope, 0 52 7
“To 1 52 7
teach 1 52 7
with 1 52 7
such 1 52 7
an 1 52 7
intentional 1 52 7
lack 1 52 7
of 1 52 7
clarity 1 52 7
inevitably 1 52 7
risks 1 52 7
sinning 1 52 7
against 1 52 7
the 1 52 7
Holy 1 52 7
Spirit, 1 52 7
the 1 52 7
Spirit 1 52 7
of 1 52 7
truth.” 1 52 7
He 0 52 7
added 0 52 7
that 0 52 7
Catholics 0 52 7
are 0 52 7
“disconcerted” 0 52 7
by 0 52 7
the 0 52 7
appointment 0 52 7
of 0 52 7
bishops 0 52 7
“who 0 52 7
seem 0 52 7
not 0 52 7
merely 0 52 7
open 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
those 0 52 7
who 0 52 7
hold 0 52 7
views 0 52 7
counter 0 52 7
to 0 52 7
Christian 0 52 7
belief, 0 52 7
but 0 52 7
who 0 52 7
support 0 52 7
and 0 52 7
even 0 52 7
defend 0 52 7
them.” 0 52 7

In 0 52 8
an 0 52 8
interview 0 52 8
yesterday 0 52 8
with 0 52 8
John 0 52 8
Allen’s 0 52 8
Crux, 0 52 8
he 0 52 8
added, 0 52 8
more 0 52 8
prophetically 0 52 8
than 0 52 8
he 0 52 8
had 0 52 8
perhaps 0 52 8
intended, 0 52 8
“I 0 52 8
don’t 0 52 8
think 0 52 8
anyone 0 52 8
can, 0 52 8
or 0 52 8
should, 0 52 8
associate 0 52 8
my 0 52 8
letter 0 52 8
with 0 52 8
the 0 52 8
USCCB 0 52 8
or 0 52 8
the 0 52 8
American 0 52 8
bishops. 0 52 8

Neither 0 52 9
was 0 52 9
involved 0 52 9
in 0 52 9
my 0 52 9
writing 0 52 9
the 0 52 9
letter, 0 52 9
and 0 52 9
its 0 52 9
publication 0 52 9
will 0 52 9
be 0 52 9
news 0 52 9
to 0 52 9

them.” 0 52 10
“Bishops 0 52 10
are 0 52 10
quick 0 52 10
learners,” 0 52 10
he 0 52 10
wrote 0 52 10
in 0 52 10
his 0 52 10
letter, 0 52 10
“and 0 52 10
what 0 52 10
many 0 52 10
have 0 52 10
learned 0 52 10
from 0 52 10
your 0 52 10
pontificate 0 52 10
is 0 52 10
not 0 52 10
that 0 52 10
you 0 52 10
are 0 52 10
open 0 52 10
to 0 52 10
criticism, 0 52 10
but 0 52 10
that 0 52 10
you 0 52 10
resent 0 52 10
it,” 0 52 10
claiming 0 52 10
that 0 52 10
many 0 52 10
bishops 0 52 10
don’t 1 52 10
speak 1 52 10
out 1 52 10
publicly 1 52 10
for 1 52 10
fear 1 52 10
they 1 52 10
will 1 52 10
be 1 52 10
“marginalized 1 52 10
or 1 52 10

worse.” 1 52 11
And 0 52 11
sure 0 52 11
enough, 0 52 11
within 0 52 11
hours 0 52 11
of 0 52 11
making 0 52 11
his 0 52 11
letter 0 52 11
public, 0 52 11
we 0 52 11
learned 0 52 11

that 0 52 12
Fr. 0 52 12
Weinandy 0 52 12
had 0 52 12
been 0 52 12
given 1 52 12

the 1 52 13
boot. 1 52 13
Of 0 52 13
course, 0 52 13
the 0 52 13
Twitterverse 0 52 13
is 0 52 13
busy 0 52 13
commenting 0 52 13
on 0 52 13
the 0 52 13
irony: 0 52 13
how 0 52 13
a 0 52 13
man 0 52 13
expressing 0 52 13
grave 0 52 13
concerns 0 52 13
that 0 52 13
there 0 52 13
is 0 52 13
an 0 52 13
atmosphere 0 52 13
of 0 52 13
fear 0 52 13
of 0 52 13
being 0 52 13
punished 0 52 13
for 0 52 13
expressing 0 52 13
grave 0 52 13
concerns, 0 52 13
was 0 52 13
immediately 0 52 13

fired. 0 52 14
Perhaps 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
most 0 52 14
astonishing 0 52 14
aspect 0 52 14
of 0 52 14
this 0 52 14
little 1 52 14
incident 1 52 14
is 0 52 14
just 0 52 14
how 0 52 14
completely 0 52 14
blind 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
US 0 52 14
bishops 0 52 14
– 0 52 14
as 0 52 14
with 0 52 14
nearly 0 52 14
all 0 52 14
the 0 52 14
episcopate 0 52 14
– 0 52 14
are 0 52 14
to 0 52 14
what 0 52 14
political 0 52 14
analysts 0 52 14
call 0 52 14

the 0 52 15
“optics”. 0 52 15
Political 0 52 15
consultants 0 52 15
often 0 52 15
ask: 0 52 15
how 0 52 15

does 0 52 16
it 0 52 16
look? 0 52 16
And 0 52 16
it 0 52 16
looks 0 52 16

extremely 1 52 17
bad. 1 52 17
As 0 52 17
though 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
fog 0 52 17
of 0 52 17
irony 0 52 17
weren’t 0 52 17
thick 0 52 17
enough, 0 52 17
in 0 52 17
response 0 52 17
to 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
outrage 0 52 17
from 0 52 17
Catholics, 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
USCCB 0 52 17
has 0 52 17
done 0 52 17
what 0 52 17
all 0 52 17
the 0 52 17
other 0 52 17
members 0 52 17
of 0 52 17
Pope 0 52 17
Francis’ 0 52 17
cabal 0 52 17
have 0 52 17
done 0 52 17
and 0 52 17
started 0 52 17
blocking 0 52 17
critics 0 52 17
from 0 52 17
its 0 52 17
Twitter 0 52 17

account. 0 52 18
Which, 0 52 18
it 0 52 18
must 0 52 18
be 0 52 18
said, 0 52 18

only 0 52 19
proves 0 52 19
Fr. 0 52 19
Weinandy’s 0 52 19
point 0 52 19

once 0 52 20
again. 0 52 20
Some 0 52 20
of 0 52 20
the 0 52 20
criticism 0 52 20
has 0 52 20
been 0 52 20

unusually 0 52 21

sharp. 0 52 22
Fr. 0 52 22
Hunwicke 0 52 22
wrote 0 52 22
this 0 52 22
afternoon, 0 52 22
“This 0 52 22

has, 0 52 23
in 0 52 23

just 0 52 24
said.” 0 52 24
As 0 52 24
I 0 52 24
write 0 52 24
this, 0 52 24
the 0 52 24
outrage 0 52 24
is 0 52 24
doing 0 52 24
the 0 52 24
opposite 0 52 24
of 0 52 24
dying 0 52 24
down, 0 52 24
and 0 52 24
is 0 52 24
surely 0 52 24
a 0 52 24
sign 0 52 24
of 0 52 24
how 0 52 24
fed 0 52 24
up 0 52 24
Catholics 0 52 24
– 0 52 24
even 0 52 24
those 0 52 24
who 0 52 24
would 0 52 24
never 0 52 24
identify 0 52 24
themselves 0 52 24
as 0 52 24
Traditionalists 0 52 24
– 0 52 24
have 0 52 24
become 0 52 24
with 0 52 24
this 0 52 24
pope 0 52 24

his 0 52 24
cadre 0 52 24

of 0 52 25
episcopal 1 52 25

In 0 52 26
his 0 52 26
letter, 0 52 26
Fr. 0 52 26
Weinandy 0 52 26
made 0 52 26
a 0 52 26
point 0 52 26
of 0 52 26
stating 0 52 26
that 0 52 26

a 0 52 27
former 0 52 27

one 0 52 30
of 0 52 30
the 0 52 30
most 0 52 30
mild-mannered, 0 52 30

the 0 52 31
church 0 52 31
and 0 52 31
the 0 52 31
papacy 0 52 31

is 0 52 32
very 0 52 32
significant. 0 52 32
He 0 52 32

to 0 52 32
the 0 52 32

Church 0 52 33
and 0 52 33
Her 0 52 33
teaching. 0 52 33
I 0 52 33
would 0 52 33
be 0 52 33
surprised 0 52 33
now 0 52 33
if 0 52 33

harder 0 52 34

Our 0 52 45

worth 0 52 47

Fr. 0 52 47
Weinandy 0 52 47
sent 0 52 47
the 0 52 47
letter 0 52 47
to 0 52 47
the 0 52 47
pope 0 52 47
on 0 52 47
July 0 52 47
31, 0 52 47
the 0 52 47
Feast 0 52 47

of 0 52 48
St. 0 52 48
Ignatius 0 52 48
of 0 52 48
Loyola. 0 52 48
Like 0 52 48
the 0 52 48
Dubia 0 52 48
cardinals, 0 52 48
he 0 52 48
said 0 52 48
he 0 52 48
made 0 52 48
it 0 52 48
public 0 52 48
only 0 52 48
after 0 52 48
the 0 52 48
pope 0 52 48

had 0 52 49
ignored 0 52 49
it 0 52 49
for 0 52 49
months. 0 52 49
Notable 0 52 49
in 0 52 49
his 0 52 49
critique 0 52 49
is 0 52 49
its 0 52 49
distinct 0 52 49
pastoral 0 52 49
flavour, 0 52 49
his 0 52 49
concern 0 52 49
on 0 52 49
the 0 52 49
effect 0 52 49
the 0 52 49
situation 0 52 49
is 0 52 49

having 0 52 50
on 0 52 50
ordinary 0 52 50
people. 0 52 50
The 0 52 50
pope, 0 52 50
he 0 52 50
said, 0 52 50
seems 0 52 50
“to 0 52 50
censor 0 52 50
and 0 52 50
even 0 52 50
mock” 0 52 50
critics 0 52 50
of 0 52 50
Amoris 0 52 50
Laetitia 0 52 50
for 0 52 50
their 0 52 50
desire 0 52 50
to 0 52 50
interpret 0 52 50
it 0 52 50
in 0 52 50
keeping 0 52 50
with 0 52 50
Catholic 0 52 50
teaching, 0 52 50
and 0 52 50
in 0 52 50
doing 0 52 50
so 0 52 50
is 0 52 50
committing 0 52 50
a 0 52 50
“kind 0 52 50
of 0 52 50
calumny…alien 0 52 50
to 0 52 50
the 0 52 50
nature 0 52 50

of 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
Petrine 0 52 51
ministry.” 0 52 51
In 0 52 51
an 0 52 51
interview 0 52 51
with 0 52 51
Crux, 0 52 51
Weinandy 0 52 51
said 0 52 51
he 0 52 51
is 0 52 51
not 0 52 51
afraid 0 52 51
of 0 52 51
reprisals 0 52 51
but 0 52 51
“more 0 52 51
concerned 0 52 51
about 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
good 0 52 51
that 0 52 51
my 0 52 51
letter 0 52 51
might 0 52 51
do.” 0 52 51
The 0 52 51
letter 0 52 51
“expresses 0 52 51
the 0 52 51
concerns 0 52 51
of 0 52 51
many 0 52 51
more 0 52 51
people 0 52 51
than 0 52 51
just 0 52 51
me, 0 52 51
ordinary 0 52 51
people 0 52 51
who’ve 0 52 51
come 0 52 51
to 0 52 51
me 0 52 51
with 0 52 51
their 0 52 51

questions 0 52 52
and 0 52 52
apprehensions. 0 52 52
I 0 52 52
wanted 0 52 52
them 0 52 52

to 0 52 53
know 0 52 53
that 0 52 53
I 0 52 53
listened.” 0 52 53
“I 0 52 53
have 1 52 53
done 1 52 53
what 1 52 53
I 1 52 53
believe 1 52 53
God 1 52 53

wanted 1 52 54
me 1 52 54
to 1 52 54

do,[1]” 1 52 55
he 0 52 55
said. 0 52 55
In 0 52 55
fact, 0 52 55
Fr. 0 52 55
Weinandy 0 52 55
has 0 52 55
bolstered 1 52 55
my 1 52 55
own 1 52 55
“Great 1 52 55
Clarifier” 1 52 55
theory, 1 52 55
saying 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
this 0 52 55
pontificate, 0 52 55
and 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
lack 0 52 55
of 0 52 55
response 0 52 55
to 0 52 55
it 0 52 55
from 0 52 55
priests 0 52 55
and 0 52 55
bishops, 0 52 55
is 0 52 55
being 0 52 55
allowed 0 52 55
by 0 52 55
God 0 52 55
in 0 52 55
order 0 52 55
to 0 52 55
reveal 0 52 55
“just 0 52 55
how 0 52 55
weak 0 52 55
is 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
faith 0 52 55
of 0 52 55
many 0 52 55
within 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
Church,” 0 52 55
He 0 52 55
added 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
Francis 0 52 55
has 0 52 55
revealed 0 52 55
that 0 52 55
many 0 52 55
in 0 52 55
the 0 52 55
Church 0 52 55
“hold 0 52 55
harmful 0 52 55
theological 0 52 55

and 0 52 56
pastoral 0 52 56
views.” 0 52 56
Which 0 52 56
inevitably 0 52 56
brings 0 52 56
to 0 52 56
mind 0 52 56
other 0 52 56
responses 0 52 56
that 0 52 56
have 0 52 56
not 0 52 56
been 0 52 56
quite 0 52 56

so 0 52 57
clear, 0 52 57
nor 0 52 57
so 0 52 57
pastoral. 0 52 57
When 0 52 57
Cardinal 0 52 57
Muller 0 52 57
was 0 52 57
removed 0 52 57
abruptly 0 52 57
from 0 52 57
his 0 52 57
position 0 52 57
as 0 52 57
head 0 52 57
of 0 52 57
the 0 52 57
CDF, 0 52 57
the 0 52 57
conservative 0 52 57
Catholic 0 52 57
world 0 52 57
wailed 0 52 57
that 0 52 57
it 0 52 57
was 0 52 57
another 0 52 57
case 0 52 57
of 0 52 57
a 0 52 57

“good” 0 52 58
prelate 0 52 58
being 0 52 58
got 0 52 58
rid 0 52 58
of. 0 52 58
And 0 52 58
it 0 52 58
seems 0 52 58
clear 0 52 58
from 0 52 58
the 0 52 58
way 0 52 58
it 0 52 58
was 0 52 58
done, 0 52 58
and 0 52 58
the 0 52 58
way 0 52 58
Francis 0 52 58
treated 0 52 58
Muller 0 52 58
in 0 52 58
general, 0 52 58

that 0 52 59
he 0 52 59
was 0 52 59
indeed 0 52 59
got 1 52 59
rid 1 52 59
of. 1 52 59
But 0 52 59
his 0 52 59
depiction 0 52 59
by 0 52 59
conservative 0 52 59
writers 0 52 59
as 0 52 59
a 0 52 59
beleaguered 0 52 59
champion 0 52 59
of 0 52 59
Catholic 0 52 59
orthodoxy 0 52 59
persecuted 0 52 59
by 0 52 59
the 0 52 59
regime 0 52 59
for 0 52 59
his 0 52 59
faithfulness 0 52 59
betrays 0 52 59
a 0 52 59
somewhat 0 52 59
selective 0 52 59

memory 0 52 60
and 0 52 60
short 0 52 60
attention 0 52 60
span. 0 52 60
Ed 0 52 60
Pentin 0 52 60
has 0 52 60
a 0 52 60
long 0 52 60
file 0 52 60
of 0 52 60
interviews 0 52 60
and 0 52 60
articles 0 52 60
about 0 52 60
Muller 0 52 60
that 0 52 60
clearly 0 52 60
show 0 52 60
his 0 52 60
complete 0 52 60
inability 0 52 60
to 0 52 60
make 0 52 60

up 0 52 61
his 0 52 61
mind 0 52 61
whose 0 52 61
side 0 52 61
he’s 0 52 61
on. 0 52 61
A 0 52 61
quick 0 52 61
examination 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
Muller’s 0 52 61
interviews 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
statements 0 52 61
reveal 0 52 61
an 0 52 61
irresolute 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
ultimately 0 52 61
calculating 0 52 61
mind 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
a 0 52 61
man 0 52 61
who 0 52 61
is 0 52 61
– 0 52 61
so 0 52 61
I 0 52 61
am 0 52 61
told 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
sources 0 52 61
close 0 52 61
to 0 52 61
him 0 52 61
– 0 52 61
motivated 0 52 61
mainly 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
a 0 52 61
puerile 0 52 61
desire 0 52 61
to 0 52 61
be 0 52 61
approved 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
by 0 52 61
the 1 52 61
“cool 1 52 61
kids” 1 52 61
in 1 52 61
the 1 52 61
Vatican, 1 52 61
on 0 52 61
the 0 52 61
one 0 52 61
hand, 0 52 61
and 0 52 61
an 0 52 61
unshakeable 0 52 61
conviction 0 52 61
of 0 52 61
his 0 52 61
own 0 52 61
theological 0 52 61

brilliance 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
other. 0 52 62
Most 0 52 62
recently, 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
October 0 52 62
30th, 0 52 62
Crux 0 52 62
quoted 0 52 62
him 0 52 62
under 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
headline, 0 52 62
“Cardinal 0 52 62
Muller 0 52 62
backs 0 52 62
Pope 0 52 62
Francis 0 52 62
against 0 52 62
critics 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
‘Amoris 0 52 62
Laetitia’” 0 52 62
in 0 52 62
which 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
former 0 52 62
head 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
CDF 0 52 62
has 0 52 62
at 0 52 62
last 0 52 62
climbed 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
board 0 52 62
the 0 52 62
Kasperian 0 52 62
train 0 52 62
on 0 52 62
reception 0 52 62
of 0 52 62
Communion 0 52 62

for 0 52 63
unrepentant 0 52 63
adulterers. 0 52 63
Signaling 1 52 63
furiously 1 52 63
with 0 52 63
the 0 52 63
trendy 0 52 63
FrancisChurch 0 52 63
buzzwords 0 52 63
and 0 52 63
even 0 52 63
trendier 0 52 63
blithering 1 52 63
incoherence, 1 52 63
Muller 0 52 63
writes 0 52 63
that 0 52 63
“mitigating 0 52 63
factors 0 52 63
in 0 52 63
guilt,” 0 52 63
can 0 52 63
lead, 0 52 63
couples 0 52 63
in 0 52 63
“an 0 52 63
uncertain 0 52 63
marital 0 52 63
situation” 0 52 63
through 0 52 63
a 0 52 63
“path 0 52 63
of 0 52 63
repentance” 0 52 63
– 0 52 63
always 0 52 63
“accompanied” 0 52 63
by 0 52 63
an 0 52 63
exquisitely 0 52 63
sensitive 0 52 63
confessor 0 52 63
– 0 52 63
to 0 52 63
a 0 52 63
point 0 52 63
where 0 52 63
the 0 52 63
reception 0 52 63

of 0 52 64
Communion 0 52 64
is 0 52 64
no 0 52 64
longer 0 52 64
sinful. 0 52 64
Presumably 1 52 64
because 1 52 64
adultery 1 52 64

itself 1 52 65
is 1 52 65
no 1 52 65
longer 1 52 65
sinful. 1 52 65

Or 0 52 66
sacrilege 0 52 66

either, 0 52 67
I 0 52 67
guess. 0 52 67
Or 0 52 67
something. 0 52 67
Somehow 0 52 67
the 0 52 67
“new 0 52 67
evangelization” 0 52 67
is 0 52 67
involved 0 52 67
in 0 52 67
this, 0 52 67
though 0 52 67
it’s 0 52 67
unclear 0 52 67
how 0 52 67
exactly 0 52 67
it 0 52 67
makes 0 52 67
adultery 0 52 67
and 0 52 67
sacrilege 0 52 67
OK. 0 52 67
Also, 0 52 67
it’s 0 52 67
very 0 52 67
important 0 52 67
to 0 52 67
fulfill 0 52 67
the 0 52 67
Sunday 0 52 67
Mass 0 52 67
obligation, 0 52 67
and 0 52 67
as 0 52 67
everyone 0 52 67
knows, 0 52 67
one 0 52 67
can’t 0 52 67
possibly 0 52 67
go 0 52 67
to 0 52 67
Mass 0 52 67
on 0 52 67
a 0 52 67

Sunday 0 52 68
without 0 52 68
receiving 0 52 68
Communion. 0 52 68
We 0 52 68
hear 0 52 68
again, 0 52 68
as 0 52 68
we 0 52 68
did 0 52 68
incessantly 0 52 68
from 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
Kasperians 0 52 68
at 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
Synods, 0 52 68
about 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
hard 0 52 68
case 0 52 68
of 0 52 68
the 1 52 68
poor, 1 52 68
poor 1 52 68
woman 1 52 68
who 0 52 68
has 0 52 68
been 0 52 68
abandoned 0 52 68
by 0 52 68
the 0 52 68
first 0 52 68
husband, 0 52 68
and 0 52 68
who 0 52 68
“finds 0 52 68
no 0 52 68
other 0 52 68
way 0 52 68
out 0 52 68
than 0 52 68
to 0 52 68
entrust 0 52 68
oneself 0 52 68
to 0 52 68
a 0 52 68
kind-hearted 0 52 68
person,” 0 52 68
… 0 52 68
with 1 52 68
whom, 1 52 68
I 1 52 68
guess, 1 52 68
she 1 52 68
has 1 52 68
also 1 52 68
no 1 52 68

choice 1 52 69
but 1 52 69
to 1 52 69
have 1 52 69
sexual 1 52 69
relations. 1 52 69

Because 1 52 70
of 1 52 70
kind-heartedness. 1 52 70
Anyway, 0 52 70
the 0 52 70
result 0 52 70
of 0 52 70
this 0 52 70
is 0 52 70
a 0 52 70
“marriage-like 0 52 70
relationship” 0 52 70
about 0 52 70
which 0 52 70
confessors 0 52 70
have 0 52 70
to 0 52 70
be 0 52 70

very 0 52 71
careful 0 52 71
not 0 52 71
to 0 52 71

say 0 52 72
mean 0 52 72
things. 0 52 72
Or 0 52 72
be 0 52 72
too 0 52 72
“extreme”. 0 52 72
It’s 0 52 72
very 0 52 72
important 0 52 72
for 0 52 72
him 0 52 72
to 0 52 72
avoid 0 52 72
a 0 52 72
“cheap 0 52 72
adaptation 0 52 72
to 0 52 72
the 0 52 72
relativistic 1 52 72
Zeitgeist,” 1 52 72
on 0 52 72
one 0 52 72
side, 0 52 72
and 0 52 72
a 0 52 72
“cold 0 52 72
application 0 52 72
of 0 52 72
the 0 52 72
dogmatic 0 52 72
commandments 0 52 72
and 0 52 72

the 0 52 73
canonical 0 52 73
rules,” 0 52 73
on 0 52 73
the 0 52 73
other. 0 52 73

Because 0 52 74
that 0 52 74

could 0 52 75
be 0 52 75
too 0 52 75
polarizing. 0 52 75
And 0 52 75
mean. 0 52 75
And 0 52 75
anyway, 0 52 75
sins 0 52 75
of 0 52 75
the 0 52 75

flesh 0 52 76
aren’t 0 52 76
the 0 52 76
worst 0 52 76
things 0 52 76
ever. 0 52 76
There 0 52 76
are, 0 52 76
like, 0 52 76
“different 0 52 76

levels” 0 52 77
of 0 52 77
gravity, 0 52 77
you 0 52 77
know? 0 52 77
And, 0 52 77
like, 0 52 77

it 0 52 78
depends 0 52 78
on 0 52 78
the 0 52 78
type 0 52 78
of 0 52 78
sin, 0 52 78
right? 0 52 78
“Spirit’s 0 52 78
sins” 0 52 78
like 0 52 78
spiritual 0 52 78
pride 0 52 78
and 0 52 78
avarice 0 52 78
and 0 52 78
stuff, 0 52 78
are 0 52 78
worse 0 52 78

than 0 52 79
“sins 0 52 79
of 0 52 79
the 0 52 79
flesh,” 0 52 79
you 0 52 79
know? 0 52 79
Which 0 52 79
are, 0 52 79
like, 0 52 79
only 0 52 79

a 0 52 80
result 0 52 80
of 0 52 80
“human 0 52 80
weakness,” 0 52 80
right? 0 52 80
Apparently 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
real 0 52 80
problem 0 52 80
with 0 52 80
this 0 52 80
whole 0 52 80
thing 0 52 80
has 0 52 80
been 0 52 80
that 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
Kasperian 0 52 80
kerfuffle 0 52 80
has 0 52 80
totally 0 52 80
been 0 52 80
blown 0 52 80
way, 0 52 80
way, 0 52 80
WAY 0 52 80
out 0 52 80
of 0 52 80
proportion, 0 52 80
and 0 52 80
the 0 52 80
“polarization” 0 52 80

it 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
caused 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
been 0 52 81
“regrettable”. 0 52 81
The 0 52 81
question 0 52 81
of 0 52 81
Communion 0 52 81
for 0 52 81
divorced 0 52 81
and 0 52 81
civilly 0 52 81
“remarried” 0 52 81
Catholics, 0 52 81
he 0 52 81
said, 0 52 81
has 0 52 81
been 0 52 81
“falsely 1 52 81
elevated 1 52 81
to 1 52 81
the 1 52 81
rank 1 52 81
of 1 52 81
a 1 52 81
decisive 1 52 81
question 1 52 81
of 1 52 81
Catholicism 1 52 81
and 1 52 81
a 1 52 81
measure 1 52 81
of 1 52 81
ideological 1 52 81
comparison 1 52 81
in 1 52 81
order 1 52 81
to 1 52 81

whether 1 52 81
one 1 52 81
is 1 52 81
conservative 1 52 81
or 1 52 81

liberal, 1 52 82
in 1 52 82
favor 1 52 82
or 1 52 82
against 1 52 82
the 1 52 82
pope.” 1 52 82
For 0 52 82
years 0 52 82
under 0 52 82
Pope 0 52 82
Benedict, 0 52 82
Muller 0 52 82
was 0 52 82
engaged 0 52 82
in 0 52 82
an 0 52 82
open 0 52 82
war 0 52 82
with 0 52 82
the 0 52 82
German 0 52 82
episcopate 0 52 82
who 0 52 82
insisted 0 52 82
that 0 52 82
they 0 52 82
were 0 52 82
going 0 52 82
to 0 52 82
allow 0 52 82
Communion 0 52 82
for 0 52 82
the 0 52 82

and 0 52 82
remarried, 0 52 82
no 0 52 82
matter 0 52 82
what 0 52 82
Rome 0 52 82
said, 0 52 82
even 1 52 82
threatening 1 52 82
to 1 52 82
go 1 52 82
into 1 52 82

schism 1 52 83
if 1 52 83
they 1 52 83
didn’t 1 52 83
get 1 52 83
their 1 52 83
way[2]. 0 52 83
Muller, 0 52 83
with 0 52 83
little 0 52 83
backing 0 52 83
from 0 52 83
Pope 0 52 83
Benedict 0 52 83
– 0 52 83
who 0 52 83
appeared 0 52 83
content 0 52 83
to 0 52 83
allow 0 52 83
his 0 52 83
CDF 0 52 83
prefect 0 52 83
and 0 52 83
the 0 52 83
Germans 0 52 83
shout 0 52 83
out 0 52 83
their 0 52 83
differences 0 52 83
– 0 52 83
and 0 52 83
with 0 52 83
outright 0 52 83
opposition 0 52 83
from 0 52 83
Francis, 0 52 83

did 0 52 84
indeed 0 52 84
strive 0 52 84
to 0 52 84
hold 0 52 84
the 0 52 84
line. 0 52 84
The 0 52 84
fact 0 52 84
that 0 52 84
Francis 0 52 84
orchestrated 0 52 84
the 0 52 84
Synods 0 52 84
to 0 52 84
undermine 0 52 84

him 0 52 85
was 0 52 85
certainly 0 52 85
not 0 52 85
his 0 52 85
fault. 0 52 85
And 0 52 85
it 0 52 85
is 0 52 85
difficult 0 52 85
to 0 52 85
imagine 0 52 85
anyone 0 52 85
being 0 52 85
in 0 52 85

a 0 52 86
worse 0 52 86
position 0 52 86
than 0 52 86
he 0 52 86
was 0 52 86
at 0 52 86
the 0 52 86
time. 0 52 86
But 0 52 86
since 0 52 86
then, 0 52 86
Muller 0 52 86
has 0 52 86
demonstrated 0 52 86
very 0 52 86
little 0 52 86
of 0 52 86
his 0 52 86
former 0 52 86
grit, 0 52 86
instead 0 52 86
attempting 0 52 86
from 0 52 86

one 0 52 87
day 0 52 87
to 0 52 87
the 0 52 87
next 0 52 87
to 0 52 87
appease 0 52 87
both 0 52 87
sides. 0 52 87
Reportedly 0 52 87
removed 0 52 87
from 0 52 87
CDF 0 52 87
– 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
of 0 52 87
course 0 52 87
lionized 1 52 87
by 0 52 87
“conservatives” 0 52 87
– 0 52 87
for 0 52 87
his 0 52 87
mild 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
equivocating 0 52 87
opposition 0 52 87
to 0 52 87
Amoris 0 52 87
Laetitia, 0 52 87
Muller 0 52 87
has 0 52 87
gone 0 52 87
back 0 52 87
and 0 52 87
forth 0 52 87
in 0 52 87
what 0 52 87
can 0 52 87
easily 0 52 87
be 0 52 87
seen 0 52 87
as 0 52 87
a 0 52 87
desperate 0 52 87

attempt 0 52 88
to 0 52 88
find 0 52 88
friends 0 52 88
in 0 52 88
both 0 52 88
camps. 0 52 88
With 0 52 88
this 0 52 88
in 0 52 88
mind 0 52 88
one 0 52 88
could 0 52 88
be 0 52 88
forgiven 0 52 88
for 0 52 88
not 0 52 88
taking 0 52 88

his 0 52 89
October 0 52 89
30th 0 52 89
essay 0 52 89
too 0 52 89
seriously. 0 52 89
Perhaps 0 52 89

one 0 52 90
of 0 52 90
the 0 52 90
good 0 52 90

of 0 52 91
the 0 52 91
Catholic 0 52 91
Church 0 52 91
is 0 52 91
supposed 0 52 91
to 0 52 91
act. 0 52 91
As 0 52 91
my 0 52 91
friend 0 52 91
said, 0 52 91
maybe 0 52 91
“it’s 0 52 91
going 0 52 91
to 0 52 91
become 0 52 91
harder 0 52 91

harder 0 52 91

In 0 52 95
this 0 52 95
interview, 0 52 95
Fr. 0 52 95
Weinandy 0 52 95
gave 0 52 95
a 0 52 95
remarkable 0 52 95
story 0 52 95
of 0 52 95
how 0 52 95
his 0 52 95
prayer 0 52 95
for 0 52 95
a 0 52 95
“sign” 0 52 95
that 0 52 95
he 0 52 95
ought 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
write 0 52 95
the 0 52 95
letter 0 52 95
was 0 52 95
very 0 52 95
specifically 0 52 95
answered: 0 52 95
“If 0 52 95
you 0 52 95
want 0 52 95
me 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
write 0 52 95
something, 0 52 95
you 0 52 95
have 0 52 95
to 0 52 95
give 0 52 95

me 0 52 96
a 0 52 96
clear 0 52 96
sign,” 0 52 96
Weinandy 0 52 96
recalls 0 52 96
saying. 0 52 96
“Tomorrow 0 52 96
morning, 0 52 96
I’m 0 52 96
going 0 52 96
to 0 52 96
Saint 0 52 96
Mary 0 52 96
Major’s 0 52 96
to 0 52 96
pray, 0 52 96

and 0 52 97
then 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
am 0 52 97
going 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
Saint 0 52 97
John 0 52 97
Lateran. 0 52 97
After 0 52 97
that, 0 52 97
I’m 0 52 97
coming 0 52 97
back 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
Saint 0 52 97
Peter’s 0 52 97
to 0 52 97
have 0 52 97
lunch 0 52 97
with 0 52 97
a 0 52 97
seminary 0 52 97
friend 0 52 97
of 0 52 97
mine.” 0 52 97
“During 0 52 97
that 0 52 97
interval, 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
must 0 52 97
meet 0 52 97
someone 0 52 97
that 0 52 97
I 0 52 97
know 0 52 97
but 0 52 97
have 0 52 97
not 0 52 97
seen 0 52 97
in 0 52 97
a 0 52 97
very 0 52 97
long 0 52 97
time, 0 52 97
and 0 52 97
would 0 52 97

never 0 52 98
expect 0 52 98
to 0 52 98
see 0 52 98
in 0 52 98
Rome 0 52 98
at 0 52 98
this 0 52 98
time. 0 52 98
That 0 52 98
person 0 52 98
cannot 0 52 98
be 0 52 98
from 0 52 98

the 0 52 99
United 0 52 99
States, 0 52 99
Canada 0 52 99
or 0 52 99
Great 0 52 99
Britain. 0 52 99
Moreover, 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
person 0 52 99
has 0 52 99
to 0 52 99
say 0 52 99
to 0 52 99
me, 0 52 99
‘Keep 0 52 99
up 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
good 0 52 99
writing’.” 0 52 99
Weinandy 0 52 99
said, 0 52 99
exactly 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
happened 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
next 0 52 99
day, 0 52 99
in 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
chance 0 52 99
meeting 0 52 99
with 0 52 99
an 0 52 99
archbishop 0 52 99
he’d 0 52 99
known 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
long 0 52 99
time 0 52 99
ago 0 52 99
but 0 52 99
not 0 52 99
seen 0 52 99
for 0 52 99
over 0 52 99
twenty 0 52 99
years, 0 52 99
who 0 52 99
congratulated 0 52 99
him 0 52 99
for 0 52 99
a 0 52 99
book 0 52 99
on 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
Incarnation 0 52 99
and 0 52 99
then 0 52 99
said 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
right 0 52 99
words, 0 52 99
“Keep 0 52 99
up 0 52 99
the 0 52 99
good 0 52 99
writing.” 0 52 99
“There 0 52 99
was 0 52 99
no 0 52 99
longer 0 52 99
any 0 52 99
doubt 0 52 99
in 0 52 99
my 0 52 99
mind 0 52 99
that 0 52 99
Jesus 0 52 99
wanted 0 52 99

me 0 52 99

to 0 52 99

write 0 52 99

something,” 0 52 99

Weinandy 0 52 99

said. 0 52 99

thing 0 54 1
is 0 54 1
for 0 54 1
sure: 0 54 1
The 1 54 1

this 1 54 1
particular 1 54 1

that 0 54 2
practically 0 54 2
from 0 54 2

inception 0 54 2
in 0 54 2
1947 0 54 2

as 0 54 3
1953, 0 54 3
the 0 54 3
CIA 0 54 3
published 0 54 3
an 0 54 3
assassination 0 54 3
manual 0 54 3
that 0 54 3
the 1 54 3
CIA 1 54 3
succeeded 1 54 3
in 1 54 3
keeping 1 54 3
secret 1 54 3
from 1 54 3
the 1 54 3
American 1 54 3
people 1 54 3
for 0 54 3
more 0 54 3
than 0 54 3
40 0 54 3
years. 0 54 3

It 0 54 4
came 0 54 4
to 0 54 4

manual 0 54 13
also 0 54 13
makes 0 54 13
it 0 54 13
clear 0 54 13
that 0 54 13
the 0 54 13
CIA 0 54 13
was 0 54 13

Note 0 54 14
the 0 54 14
following 0 54 14
excerpt: 0 54 14

For 0 54 15
secret 0 54 15
assassination, 0 54 15
either 0 54 15
simple 0 54 15
or 0 54 15
chase, 0 54 15
the 0 54 15
contrived 0 54 15
accident 0 54 15
is 0 54 15
the 0 54 15
most 0 54 15
effective 0 54 15
technique. 0 54 15

When 0 54 16
successfully 0 54 16
executed, 0 54 16
it 0 54 16
causes 0 54 16
little 0 54 16
excitement 0 54 16
and 0 54 16
is 0 54 16
only 0 54 16
casually 0 54 16
investigated. 0 54 16

It 0 54 17
would 0 54 17
be 0 54 17
safe 0 54 17
to 0 54 17
assume 0 54 17
that 0 54 17
the 0 54 17
CIA 0 54 17
continued 0 54 17
developing 0 54 17
and 0 54 17
expanding 0 54 17
on 0 54 17
the 0 54 17
assassination 0 54 17
principles 0 54 17
enunciated 0 54 17
in 0 54 17
that 0 54 17
early 0 54 17
assassination 0 54 17
manual. 0 54 17

That’s 0 54 18
what 0 54 18
we 0 54 18
would 0 54 18
expect 0 54 18
from 0 54 18
an 0 54 18
agency 0 54 18
whose 0 54 18
specialties 0 54 18
included 0 54 18
assassination. 0 54 18

We 0 54 19
can 0 54 19
also 0 54 19
assume 0 54 19
that 0 54 19
the 0 54 19
CIA 0 54 19
continued 0 54 19
to 0 54 19
refine 0 54 19
the 0 54 19
ways 0 54 19
to 0 54 19

The 0 54 21
CIA 0 54 21
published 0 54 21
that 0 54 21
secret 0 54 21
assassination 0 54 21
manual 0 54 21
as 0 54 21
part 0 54 21
of 0 54 21
its 0 54 21
preparations 0 54 21
for 0 54 21
a 0 54 21
U.S. 0 54 21
regime-change 0 54 21
operation 0 54 21
in 0 54 21
Guatemala, 0 54 21
one 0 54 21
that 0 54 21
was 0 54 21
designed 0 54 21
to 0 54 21
violently 1 54 21
remove 1 54 21
the 0 54 21
nation’s 0 54 21
democratically 0 54 21
elected 0 54 21
socialist 0 54 21
president, 0 54 21
Jacobo 0 54 21
Arbenz, 0 54 21
from 0 54 21
office 0 54 21
and 0 54 21
replace 0 54 21
him 0 54 21
with 0 54 21
an 0 54 21
unelected, 1 54 21
right-wing, 1 54 21
pro-U.S. 1 54 21
military 1 54 21
general. 1 54 21

As 0 54 22
part 0 54 22
of 0 54 22
the 0 54 22
Guatemala 0 54 22
regime-change 0 54 22
operation, 0 54 22
the 0 54 22
CIA 0 54 22
prepared 0 54 22
a 0 54 22
list 0 54 22
of 0 54 22
Guatemalan 0 54 22
officials 0 54 22
to 0 54 22
be 0 54 22
assassinated. 0 54 22

While 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
CIA 0 54 23
has 0 54 23
never 0 54 23
revealed 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
names 0 54 23
of 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
people 0 54 23
it 0 54 23
targeted 0 54 23
for 0 54 23
assassination, 0 54 23
there 0 54 23
is 0 54 23
little 0 54 23
doubt 0 54 23
that 0 54 23
Arbenz, 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
president, 0 54 23
was 0 54 23
at 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
top 0 54 23
of 0 54 23
the 0 54 23
list. 0 54 23

There 0 54 24
is 0 54 24
something 0 54 24
important 0 54 24
to 0 54 24
note: 0 54 24
Neither 0 54 24
Arbenz 0 54 24
nor 0 54 24
any 0 54 24
other 0 54 24
Guatemalan 0 54 24
official 0 54 24
had 0 54 24
ever 0 54 24
attacked 0 54 24
the 0 54 24
United 0 54 24
States 0 54 24
or 0 54 24
even 0 54 24
threatened 0 54 24
to 0 54 24
do 0 54 24
so. 0 54 24

So, 0 54 25
why 0 54 25
were 0 54 25
they 0 54 25
targeted 0 54 25
for 0 54 25
assassination? 0 54 25

Because 0 54 26
Arbenz 0 54 26
had 0 54 26
reached 0 54 26
out 0 54 26
to 0 54 26
the 0 54 26
Russians 0 54 26
and 0 54 26
Cubans 0 54 26
in 0 54 26
a 0 54 26
spirit 0 54 26
of 0 54 26
peace 0 54 26
and 0 54 26
friendship, 0 54 26
just 0 54 26
as 0 54 26
John 0 54 26
Kennedy 0 54 26
would 0 54 26
do 0 54 26
ten 0 54 26
years 0 54 26
later. 0 54 26

That’s 0 54 27
why 0 54 27
the 0 54 27
CIA 0 54 27
targeted 0 54 27
Guatemala 0 54 27
for 0 54 27
regime 0 54 27
change 0 54 27
and 0 54 27
why 0 54 27
it 0 54 27
targeted 0 54 27
Arbenz 0 54 27
and 0 54 27
other 0 54 27
Guatemalan 0 54 27
officials 0 54 27
for 0 54 27
assassination. 0 54 27

Although 0 54 28
Arbenz 0 54 28
was 0 54 28
able 0 54 28
to 0 54 28
escape 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
country, 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
CIA’s 0 54 28
regime-change 0 54 28
operation 0 54 28
was 0 54 28
a 1 54 28
total 1 54 28
success, 1 54 28
with 0 54 28
Arbenz 0 54 28
being 0 54 28
replaced 0 54 28
by 0 54 28
the 0 54 28
pro-U.S. 0 54 28
Gen. 0 54 28
Carlos 0 54 28
Castillo 0 54 28
Armas, 0 54 28
who 0 54 28
proceeded 0 54 28
to 0 54 28
instigate 0 54 28
a 1 54 28
reign 1 54 28
of 1 54 28
terror 1 54 28
across 0 54 28
Guatemala. 0 54 28

The 1 54 29
Guatemalan 1 54 29
operation 1 54 29
was 1 54 29
brilliant 1 54 29
and 1 54 29
ingenious. 1 54 29

The 0 54 30
CIA 0 54 30
officials 0 54 30
were 0 54 30
secretly 0 54 30
honored 0 54 30
for 0 54 30
protecting 0 54 30
“national 0 54 30
security” 0 54 30
by 0 54 30
removing 0 54 30
President 0 54 30
Arbenz 0 54 30
from 0 54 30
office 0 54 30
and 0 54 30
replacing 0 54 30
him 0 54 30
with 0 54 30
a 0 54 30
pro-U.S. 0 54 30
military 0 54 30
general. 0 54 30

Tracy 0 54 31
Barnes, 0 54 31
one 0 54 31
of 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
CIA 0 54 31
officials 0 54 31
responsible 0 54 31
for 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
operation, 0 54 31
was 0 54 31
awarded 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
Distinguished 0 54 31
Intelligence 0 54 31
Medal, 0 54 31
the 0 54 31
CIA’s 0 54 31
second-highest 0 54 31
medal. 0 54 31

The 1 54 32
CIA’s 1 54 32
cover-up 1 54 32
in 1 54 32
the 1 54 32
JFK 1 54 32
assassination 1 54 32
was 1 54 32
even 1 54 32
more 1 54 32
brilliant 1 54 32
and 1 54 32
ingenious. 1 54 32

The 0 54 33
doctors 0 54 33
at 0 54 33
Parkland 0 54 33
Hospital 0 54 33
stated 0 54 33
that 0 54 33
President 0 54 33
Kennedy 0 54 33
had 0 54 33
a 0 54 33
big 0 54 33
exit-sized 0 54 33
wound 0 54 33
in 0 54 33
the 0 54 33
back 0 54 33
of 0 54 33
his 0 54 33
head, 0 54 33
which 0 54 33
implied 0 54 33
a 0 54 33
shot 0 54 33
having 0 54 33
been 0 54 33
fired 0 54 33
from 0 54 33
the 0 54 33
front. 0 54 33

At 0 54 34
a 0 54 34
press 0 54 34
conference 0 54 34
immediately 0 54 34
after 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
president 0 54 34
died, 0 54 34
two 0 54 34
treating 0 54 34
physicians 0 54 34
stated 0 54 34
that 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
other 0 54 34
wound 0 54 34
— 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
one 0 54 34
in 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
front 0 54 34
of 0 54 34
Kennedy’s 0 54 34
neck 0 54 34
— 0 54 34
was 0 54 34
an 0 54 34
entry 0 54 34
wound, 0 54 34
which 0 54 34
implied 0 54 34
that 0 54 34
Kennedy 0 54 34
had 0 54 34
been 0 54 34
hit 0 54 34
by 0 54 34
another 0 54 34
shot 0 54 34
fired 0 54 34
from 0 54 34
the 0 54 34
front. 0 54 34

This 0 54 35
necessarily 0 54 35
meant 0 54 35
that 0 54 35
Kennedy 0 54 35
had 0 54 35
been 0 54 35
shot 0 54 35
from 0 54 35
the 0 54 35
front, 0 54 35
not 0 54 35
the 0 54 35
rear, 0 54 35
where 0 54 35
accused 0 54 35
assassin 0 54 35
Lee 0 54 35
Harvey 0 54 35
Oswald 0 54 35
was 0 54 35
situated. 0 54 35

Keep 0 54 36
in 0 54 36
mind 0 54 36
something 0 54 36
important: 0 54 36
After 0 54 36
he 0 54 36
was 0 54 36
arrested, 0 54 36
Oswald 0 54 36
claimed 0 54 36
his 0 54 36
innocence. 0 54 36

But 0 54 37
he 0 54 37
also 0 54 37
went 0 54 37
a 0 54 37
step 0 54 37
further. 0 54 37

He 0 54 38
said 0 54 38
that 0 54 38
he 0 54 38
was 0 54 38
being 0 54 38
framed 0 54 38
for 0 54 38
the 0 54 38
crime. 0 54 38

The 0 54 39
obvious 0 54 39
question 0 54 39
arises: 0 54 39
Why 0 54 39
frame 0 54 39
an 0 54 39
innocent 0 54 39
man 0 54 39
who 0 54 39
is 0 54 39
situated 0 54 39
in 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
rear 0 54 39
by 0 54 39
killing 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
president 0 54 39
with 0 54 39
shots 0 54 39
fired 0 54 39
from 0 54 39
the 0 54 39
front? 0 54 39

Wouldn’t 0 54 40
it 0 54 40
be 0 54 40
more 0 54 40
logical 0 54 40
to 0 54 40
either 0 54 40
have 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
shots 0 54 40
fired 0 54 40
from 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
rear, 0 54 40
where 0 54 40
Oswald 0 54 40
was, 0 54 40
or, 0 54 40
alternatively, 0 54 40
place 0 54 40
Oswald 0 54 40
in 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
front, 0 54 40
where 0 54 40
the 0 54 40
shots 0 54 40
were 0 54 40
fired? 0 54 40

That’s 0 54 41
where 0 54 41
the 1 54 41
brilliance, 1 54 41
ingenuity, 1 54 41
and 1 54 41
cunningness 1 54 41
of 1 54 41
the 1 54 41
cover-up 1 54 41
come 0 54 41
into 0 54 41
play. 0 54 41

If 0 54 42
Oswald 0 54 42
is 0 54 42
in 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
rear 0 54 42
and 0 54 42
since 0 54 42
shots 0 54 42
are 0 54 42
fired 0 54 42
from 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
front, 0 54 42
that 0 54 42
could 0 54 42
mean 0 54 42
only 0 54 42
one 0 54 42
thing: 0 54 42
that 0 54 42
Oswald 0 54 42
had 0 54 42
confederates 0 54 42
firing 0 54 42
from 0 54 42
the 0 54 42
front. 0 54 42

Who 0 54 43
would 0 54 43
those 0 54 43
confederates 0 54 43
be? 0 54 43

There 1 54 44
could 1 54 44
be 1 54 44
only 1 54 44
one 1 54 44
answer: 1 54 44
communists. 1 54 44

Soviet 1 54 45
and 1 54 45
Cuban 1 54 45
communists, 1 54 45
to 1 54 45
be 1 54 45
more 1 54 45
specific. 1 54 45

How 0 54 46
would 0 54 46
we 0 54 46
know 0 54 46
this? 0 54 46

That’s 0 54 47
where 0 54 47
Oswald’s 0 54 47
trip 0 54 47
to 0 54 47
Mexico 0 54 47
City 0 54 47
right 0 54 47
before 0 54 47
the 0 54 47
assassination 0 54 47
comes 0 54 47
into 0 54 47
play. 0 54 47

Regime 0 54 48

Oswald 0 54 49
traveled 0 54 49
to 0 54 49
Mexico 0 54 49
City 0 54 49
where 0 54 49
he 0 54 49
purportedly 0 54 49
visited 0 54 49
the 0 54 49
Soviet 0 54 49
and 0 54 49
Cuban 0 54 49
embassies 0 54 49
and 0 54 49
where 0 54 49
he 0 54 49
supposedly 0 54 49
met 0 54 49
with 0 54 49
a 0 54 49
premier 0 54 49
assassin 0 54 49
for 0 54 49
the 0 54 49
Soviet 0 54 49
Union. 0 54 49

Keep 0 54 50
in 0 54 50
mind 0 54 50
that 0 54 50
this 0 54 50
was 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
height 0 54 50
of 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
Cold 0 54 50
War 0 54 50
between 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
United 0 54 50
States 0 54 50
and 0 54 50
that 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
Cuban 0 54 50
Missile 0 54 50
Crisis, 0 54 50
which 0 54 50
brought 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
world 0 54 50
to 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
brink 0 54 50
of 0 54 50
nuclear 0 54 50
war, 0 54 50
had 0 54 50
taken 0 54 50
place 0 54 50
the 0 54 50
previous 0 54 50
year. 0 54 50

So, 0 54 51
President 0 54 51
Kennedy 0 54 51
has 0 54 51
been 0 54 51
assassinated. 0 54 51

Oswald 0 54 52
is 0 54 52
immediately 0 54 52
arrested. 0 54 52

He 0 54 53
has 0 54 53
confederates 0 54 53
firing 0 54 53
from 0 54 53
the 0 54 53
front, 0 54 53
who 1 54 53
almost 1 54 53
certainly 1 54 53
are 1 54 53
Soviet 1 54 53
and 1 54 53
Cuban 1 54 53
communists, 1 54 53
especially 0 54 53
since 0 54 53
Oswald 0 54 53
has 0 54 53
supposedly 0 54 53
just 0 54 53
recently 0 54 53
visited 0 54 53
the 0 54 53
Soviet 0 54 53
and 0 54 53
Cuban 0 54 53
embassies 0 54 53
in 0 54 53
Mexico 0 54 53
City. 0 54 53

What 0 54 54
does 0 54 54
all 0 54 54
that 0 54 54
mean? 0 54 54

An 0 54 55
assassination 0 54 55
of 0 54 55
the 0 54 55
president 0 54 55
by 0 54 55
the 0 54 55
Soviet 0 54 55
Union 0 54 55
and 0 54 55
Cuba 0 54 55
is 0 54 55
obviously 0 54 55
an 0 54 55
act 0 54 55
of 0 54 55
war. 0 54 55

That 0 54 56
means 0 54 56
nuclear 0 54 56
war 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
about 0 54 56
to 0 54 56
break 0 54 56
out 0 54 56
because 0 54 56
there 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
no 0 54 56
way 0 54 56
that 0 54 56
the 0 54 56
United 0 54 56
States 0 54 56
is 0 54 56
going 0 54 56
to 0 54 56
sit 0 54 56
idly 0 54 56
by 0 54 56
when 0 54 56
the 1 54 56
Reds 1 54 56
have 0 54 56
just 0 54 56
assassinated 0 54 56
America’s 0 54 56
president. 0 54 56

Except 0 54 57
for 0 54 57
one 0 54 57
thing: 0 54 57
The 1 54 57
communist 1 54 57
part 1 54 57
and 1 54 57
the 1 54 57
nuclear-war 1 54 57
part 1 54 57
were 1 54 57
concocted. 1 54 57

That 1 54 58
was 1 54 58
all 1 54 58
part 1 54 58
of 1 54 58
the 1 54 58
plan. 1 54 58

That 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
the 1 54 59
ingenious 1 54 59
way 1 54 59
that 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
CIA 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
able 0 54 59
to 0 54 59
get 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
investigation 0 54 59
into 0 54 59
the 0 54 59
assassination 0 54 59
squelched 0 54 59
just 0 54 59
as 0 54 59
soon 0 54 59
as 0 54 59
Oswald 0 54 59
was 0 54 59
murdered. 0 54 59

In 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
early 0 54 60
days 0 54 60
of 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
Warren 0 54 60
Commission, 0 54 60
commission 0 54 60
chairman 0 54 60
Earl 0 54 60
Warren 0 54 60
called 0 54 60
a 0 54 60
top-secret 0 54 60
meeting 0 54 60
of 0 54 60
the 0 54 60
commission. 0 54 60

Its 0 54 61
purpose 0 54 61
was 0 54 61
to 0 54 61
discuss 0 54 61
information 0 54 61
that 0 54 61
Warren 0 54 61
had 0 54 61
received 0 54 61
that 0 54 61
Oswald 0 54 61
was 0 54 61
actually 0 54 61
a 0 54 61
U.S. 0 54 61
intelligence 0 54 61
agent 0 54 61
or 0 54 61
an 0 54 61
informant 0 54 61
for 0 54 61
the 0 54 61
FBI 0 54 61
or 0 54 61
both. 0 54 61

How 0 54 62
did 0 54 62
Warren 0 54 62
resolve 0 54 62
this 0 54 62
troubling 0 54 62
issue? 0 54 62

He 0 54 63
simply 0 54 63
asked 0 54 63
the 0 54 63
heads 0 54 63
of 0 54 63
the 0 54 63
CIA 0 54 63
and 0 54 63
FBI 0 54 63
whether 0 54 63
it 0 54 63
was 0 54 63
true. 0 54 63

They 0 54 64
said 0 54 64
no. 0 54 64

That 0 54 65
was 0 54 65
the 0 54 65
end 0 54 65
of 0 54 65
the 0 54 65
matter. 0 54 65

The 0 54 66
issue 0 54 66
was 0 54 66
so 0 54 66
sensitive 0 54 66
that 0 54 66
Warren 0 54 66
ordered 0 54 66
the 0 54 66
members 0 54 66
of 0 54 66
the 0 54 66
commission 0 54 66
to 1 54 66
never 1 54 66
reveal 1 54 66
the 1 54 66
meeting 1 54 66
to 1 54 66
the 1 54 66
American 1 54 66
people. 1 54 66

He 0 54 67
ordered 0 54 67
all 0 54 67
notes 0 54 67
and 0 54 67
other 0 54 67
written 0 54 67
references 0 54 67
to 0 54 67
be 0 54 67
destroyed. 0 54 67

He 0 54 68
also 0 54 68
ordered 0 54 68
the 0 54 68
court 0 54 68
reporter 0 54 68
to 0 54 68
destroy 0 54 68
her 0 54 68
notes 0 54 68
of 0 54 68
the 0 54 68
meeting. 0 54 68

Unbeknownst 0 54 69
to 0 54 69
him, 0 54 69
the 0 54 69
court 0 54 69
reporter 0 54 69
inadvertently 0 54 69
kept 0 54 69
a 0 54 69
recording 0 54 69
of 0 54 69
the 0 54 69
meeting 0 54 69
that 0 54 69
ultimately 0 54 69
came 0 54 69
to 0 54 69
light. 0 54 69

This 0 54 70
troubling 0 54 70
issue 0 54 70
arose 0 54 70
again 0 54 70
yesterday, 0 54 70
November 0 54 70
2, 0 54 70
in 0 54 70

BELIN: 0 54 71
Well, 0 54 71
now, 0 54 71
the 0 54 71
final 0 54 71
area 0 54 71
of 0 54 71
my 0 54 71
interrogation 0 54 71
relates 0 54 71
to 0 54 71
charges 0 54 71
that 0 54 71
the 0 54 71
CIA 0 54 71
was 0 54 71
in 0 54 71
some 0 54 71
way 0 54 71
conspiratorially 0 54 71

the 0 54 71

is 0 54 72
that 0 54 72
correct? 0 54 72

HELMS: 0 54 73
I 0 54 73
believe 0 54 73
so. 0 54 73

where 0 54 75
the 0 54 75
transcript 0 54 75
ends 0 54 75
according 0 54 75
to 0 54 75

Shapira 0 54 76
points 0 54 76
out, 0 54 76
“Several 0 54 76

the 0 54 76
assassination.” 0 54 76
Shapira 0 54 76
points 0 54 76
out 0 54 76
that 0 54 76
Helms’ 0 54 76
full 0 54 76
deposition 0 54 76
has 0 54 76
been 0 54 76
in 0 54 76
the 0 54 76
public 0 54 76
arena 0 54 76
since 0 54 76
1994. 0 54 76

(The 0 54 77
year 0 54 77
1994 0 54 77
was 0 54 77
during 0 54 77
the 0 54 77

The 0 54 78

been 0 54 78
formed 0 54 78
after 0 54 78

posited 0 54 78

Shapira 0 54 79
then 0 54 79
proceeds 0 54 79
to 0 54 79
provide 0 54 79
the 0 54 79
answer 0 54 79
that 0 54 79
Helms 0 54 79
gave, 0 54 79
which, 0 54 79
as 0 54 79

out, 0 54 79
has 0 54 79

public: 0 54 79

HELMS: 0 54 80
Mr. 0 54 80
Belin, 0 54 80
this 0 54 80
question, 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
I 0 54 80
think 0 54 80
you 0 54 80
may 0 54 80
recall 0 54 80
this, 0 54 80
was 0 54 80
raised 0 54 80
at 0 54 80
the 0 54 80
time 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
the 0 54 80
Agency 0 54 80
was 0 54 80
never 0 54 80
able 0 54 80
to 0 54 80
find 0 54 80
any 0 54 80
evidence 0 54 80
whatsoever, 0 54 80
and 0 54 80
we 0 54 80
really 0 54 80
searched 0 54 80
that 0 54 80
it 0 54 80
had 0 54 80
any 0 54 80
contact 0 54 80
with 0 54 80
Lee 0 54 80
Harvey 0 54 80
Oswald. 0 54 80

As 0 54 81
far 0 54 81
as 0 54 81
the 0 54 81
FBI 0 54 81
was 0 54 81
concerned, 0 54 81
my 0 54 81
recollection 0 54 81
is 0 54 81
not 0 54 81
all 0 54 81
that 0 54 81
precise. 0 54 81

I 0 54 82
believe 0 54 82
that 0 54 82
Mr. 0 54 82
Hoover 0 54 82
testified 0 54 82
that 0 54 82
he 0 54 82
had 0 54 82
not 0 54 82
been 0 54 82
an 0 54 82
agent 0 54 82
of 0 54 82
theirs 0 54 82
either. 0 54 82

He 0 54 83
was 0 54 83
certainly 0 54 83
not 0 54 83
an 0 54 83
agent 0 54 83
of 0 54 83
the 0 54 83
CIA. 0 54 83

He 0 54 84
was 0 54 84
certainly 0 54 84
never 0 54 84
used 0 54 84
by 0 54 84
the 0 54 84
CIA. 0 54 84

Whether 0 54 85
any 0 54 85
CIA 0 54 85
officer 0 54 85
ever 0 54 85
talked 0 54 85
to 0 54 85
him 0 54 85
any 0 54 85
place 0 54 85
or 0 54 85
not 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
don’t 0 54 85
know 0 54 85
but 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
certainly 0 54 85
felt 0 54 85
quite 0 54 85
comfortable 0 54 85
— 0 54 85
I 0 54 85
believe 0 54 85
Mr. 0 54 85
[John] 0 54 85
McCone 0 54 85
[a 0 54 85
previous 0 54 85
CIA 0 54 85
director] 0 54 85
was 0 54 85
asked 0 54 85
to 0 54 85
testify 0 54 85
before 0 54 85
the 0 54 85
Commission 0 54 85
on 0 54 85
this 0 54 85
point. 0 54 85

I 0 54 86
believe 0 54 86
he 0 54 86
was 0 54 86
asked 0 54 86
to 0 54 86
testify. 0 54 86

It 0 54 87
was 0 54 87
a 0 54 87
hot 0 54 87
item 0 54 87
anyway 0 54 87
at 0 54 87
the 0 54 87
time. 0 54 87

And 0 54 88
my 0 54 88
recollection 0 54 88
is 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
I 0 54 88
informed 0 54 88
Mr. 0 54 88
McCone 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
we 0 54 88
could 0 54 88
find 0 54 88
no 0 54 88
evidence 0 54 88
that 0 54 88
Oswald 0 54 88
had 0 54 88
any 0 54 88
connection 0 54 88
with 0 54 88
the 0 54 88
CIA. 0 54 88

Shapira 0 54 89
ends 0 54 89
his 0 54 89
article 0 54 89
by 0 54 89
suggesting 0 54 89
that 0 54 89
commentators 1 54 89
should 1 54 89
do 1 54 89
more 1 54 89
complete 1 54 89
research, 1 54 89
maybe 1 54 89
even 1 54 89
use 1 54 89
Google, 1 54 89
before 1 54 89
they 1 54 89
jump 1 54 89
to 1 54 89
conclusions. 1 54 89

But 1 54 90
Shapira 1 54 90
would 1 54 90
be 1 54 90
wise 1 54 90
to 1 54 90
follow 1 54 90
his 1 54 90
own 1 54 90
advice 1 54 90
because 1 54 90
he 1 54 90
himself 1 54 90
is 1 54 90
guilty 1 54 90
of 1 54 90
what 1 54 90
he 1 54 90
accuses 1 54 90
others 1 54 90
of. 1 54 90

That’s 0 54 91
because 0 54 91
he 1 54 91
failed 1 54 91
to 1 54 91
conclude 1 54 91
his 1 54 91
article 1 54 91
with 1 54 91
one 1 54 91
great 1 54 91
big 1 54 91
important 1 54 91
point 1 54 91
about 1 54 91
former 1 54 91
CIA 1 54 91
Director 1 54 91
Richard 1 54 91
Helms. 1 54 91

What 0 54 92
is 0 54 92
that 0 54 92
great 1 54 92
big 1 54 92
important 1 54 92
point 1 54 92
that 0 54 92
Shapira, 0 54 92
who, 1 54 92
according 1 54 92

the 0 54 98

Thus, 0 54 102
given 0 54 102
that 0 54 102

The 0 54 105
circumstantial 0 54 105
evidence 0 54 105
overwhelmingly 1 54 105
establishes 0 54 105
that 0 54 105
Oswald 0 54 105
was 0 54 105
working 0 54 105
for 0 54 105
U.S. 0 54 105
intelligence. 0 54 105

How 0 54 106
often 0 54 106
have 0 54 106
you 0 54 106
ever 0 54 106
heard 0 54 106
of 0 54 106
a 0 54 106
U.S. 0 54 106
Marine 0 54 106
communist? 0 54 106

If 0 54 107
Oswald 0 54 107
was 0 54 107
a 0 54 107
genuine 0 54 107
communist, 0 54 107
why 0 54 107
would 0 54 107
he 0 54 107
have 0 54 107
joined 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Marines 0 54 107
in 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
1950s, 0 54 107
given 0 54 107
that 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Marines 0 54 107
hated 0 54 107
communists 0 54 107
and 0 54 107
had 0 54 107
just 0 54 107
helped 0 54 107
kill 0 54 107
millions 0 54 107
of 0 54 107
them 0 54 107
in 0 54 107
the 0 54 107
Korean 0 54 107
War? 0 54 107

Why 0 54 108
would 0 54 108
a 0 54 108
genuine 0 54 108
communist 0 54 108
want 0 54 108
to 0 54 108
join 0 54 108
an 0 54 108
organization 0 54 108
in 0 54 108
which 0 54 108
he 0 54 108
could 0 54 108
be 0 54 108
ordered, 0 54 108
on 0 54 108
a 0 54 108
moment’s 0 54 108
notice, 0 54 108
to 0 54 108

Don’t 0 54 109

this 0 54 109

the 0 54 109
height 0 54 109
of 0 54 109
the 0 54 109
Cold 0 54 109
War! 0 54 109

After 0 54 110
Oswald 0 54 110
supposedly 0 54 110
tried 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
“defect” 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
Soviet 0 54 110
Union 0 54 110
and 0 54 110
promised 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
give 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
Russians 0 54 110
all 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
secrets 0 54 110
he 0 54 110
learned 0 54 110
about 0 54 110
in 0 54 110
the 0 54 110
military, 0 54 110
why 0 54 110
would 0 54 110
U.S. 0 54 110
officials 0 54 110
agree 0 54 110
to 0 54 110
let 0 54 110
him 0 54 110
back 0 54 110

country, 0 54 110
and 0 54 110
with 0 54 110
a 0 54 110
communist 1 54 110

Why 0 54 111
wouldn’t 0 54 111
they 0 54 111
indict 0 54 111
him 0 54 111
or 0 54 111
at 0 54 111
least 0 54 111
haul 0 54 111
him 0 54 111
before 0 54 111
a 0 54 111
federal 0 54 111
grand 0 54 111
jury 0 54 111
to 0 54 111
testify 0 54 111
as 0 54 111
to 0 54 111
what 0 54 111
secrets 0 54 111
he 0 54 111
gave 0 54 111
the 0 54 111
Russians? 0 54 111

Why 0 54 112
wouldn’t 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
harass, 1 54 112
abuse, 1 54 112
humiliate, 1 54 112
persecute, 1 54 112
or 1 54 112
prosecute 1 54 112
him, 1 54 112
like 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
did 0 54 112
to 0 54 112
Martin 0 54 112
Luther 0 54 112
King, 0 54 112

and 0 54 112
other 0 54 112
people 0 54 112
they 0 54 112
have 0 54 112
deemed 0 54 112
to 0 54 112
be 0 54 112
communists 0 54 112
or 0 54 112
traitors? 0 54 112

How 0 54 113
is 0 54 113
it 0 54 113
possible 0 54 113
that 0 54 113
Oswald 0 54 113
could 0 54 113
learn 0 54 113
fluent 0 54 113
Russian 0 54 113
while 0 54 113
serving 0 54 113
in 0 54 113
the 0 54 113
U.S. 0 54 113
military 0 54 113
without 0 54 113
having 0 54 113
U.S. 0 54 113
military 0 54 113
tutors 0 54 113
teaching 0 54 113
him? 0 54 113

How 0 54 114
is 0 54 114
it 0 54 114
possible 0 54 114
that 0 54 114
a 0 54 114
veteran 0 54 114
who 0 54 114
embarrasses 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
U.S. 0 54 114
Marine 0 54 114
Corps 0 54 114
by 0 54 114
openly 0 54 114
proselytizing 0 54 114
for 0 54 114
communism 0 54 114
in 0 54 114
New 0 54 114
Orleans 0 54 114
is 0 54 114
able 0 54 114
to 0 54 114
saunter 0 54 114
across 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
Cold 0 54 114
War 0 54 114
stage 0 54 114
of 0 54 114
history, 0 54 114
not 0 54 114
long 0 54 114
after 0 54 114
the 0 54 114
McCarthy 0 54 114
hearings, 0 54 114
without 1 54 114
nary 1 54 114
a 1 54 114
care 1 54 114
in 1 54 114
the 1 54 114
world? 1 54 114

The 1 54 115
answer: 1 54 115
Helms 1 54 115
lied. 1 54 115

There 1 54 116
is 1 54 116
no 1 54 116
reasonable 1 54 116
doubt 1 54 116
that 1 54 116
Oswald 1 54 116
was 1 54 116
a 1 54 116
U.S. 1 54 116
intelligence 1 54 116
agent, 1 54 116
one 0 54 116
who 0 54 116
was 0 54 116
ordered 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
travel 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
Mexico 0 54 116
City 0 54 116
to 0 54 116
set 0 54 116
the 0 54 116
framework 0 54 116
for 0 54 116
his 0 54 116
frame-up. 0 54 116

But 0 54 117
things 0 54 117
obviously 0 54 117
went 0 54 117
dreadfully 1 54 117
wrong 1 54 117
in 0 54 117
Mexico 0 54 117
City, 0 54 117
which 0 54 117
is 0 54 117
why 0 54 117
the 0 54 117
CIA 0 54 117
had 0 54 117
to 0 54 117
shut 0 54 117
down 0 54 117
that 0 54 117
part 0 54 117
of 0 54 117
the 0 54 117
post-assassination 0 54 117
investigation. 0 54 117

Not 0 54 118
surprisingly, 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
CIA’s 0 54 118
Mexico 0 54 118
City 0 54 118
operations 0 54 118
regarding 0 54 118
Oswald 0 54 118
are 0 54 118
among 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
98 0 54 118
percent 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
records 0 54 118
that 0 54 118
Trump 0 54 118
and 0 54 118
the 0 54 118
CIA 0 54 118
have 0 54 118
chosen 0 54 118
to 0 54 118
continue 0 54 118
keeping 1 54 118
secret 1 54 118
from 1 54 118
the 1 54 118
American 1 54 118
people, 1 54 118
on 0 54 118
grounds 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
“national 0 54 118
security” 0 54 118
of 0 54 118
course. 0 54 118

Thus, 0 54 119
when 1 54 119
Oswald 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
claiming 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
he 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
being 1 54 119
framed, 1 54 119
there 1 54 119
could 1 54 119
be 1 54 119
only 1 54 119
one 1 54 119
entity 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
he 1 54 119
could 1 54 119
have 1 54 119
been 1 54 119
thinking 1 54 119
about: 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
CIA, 1 54 119
the 0 54 119
agency 0 54 119
whose 0 54 119
officials, 0 54 119
as 0 54 119
former 0 54 119
Washington 0 54 119
Post 0 54 119
investigative 0 54 119
reporter 0 54 119
Jefferson 0 54 119
Morley 0 54 119
has 0 54 119
documented, 0 54 119
were 1 54 119
secretly 1 54 119
monitoring 1 54 119
his 1 54 119
activities 1 54 119
in 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
weeks 1 54 119
leading 1 54 119
up 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
the 1 54 119
assassination, 1 54 119
no 1 54 119
doubt 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
ensure 1 54 119
that 1 54 119
Oswald 1 54 119
had 1 54 119
not 1 54 119
figured 1 54 119
out 1 54 119
what 1 54 119
was 1 54 119
about 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
happen 1 54 119
to 1 54 119
him. 1 54 119

We 0 54 120
can 0 54 120
assume 0 54 120
that 0 54 120
any 0 54 120
frame-up 0 54 120
by 0 54 120
the 0 54 120
CIA 0 54 120
is 0 54 120
going 0 54 120
to 0 54 120
be 0 54 120
good. 0 54 120

The 0 54 121
operation 0 54 121
is 0 54 121
going 0 54 121
to 0 54 121
be 0 54 121
carefully 0 54 121
planned 0 54 121
and 0 54 121
executed. 0 54 121

But 1 54 122
no 1 54 122
plan 1 54 122
is 1 54 122
perfect. 1 54 122

Things 0 54 123
are 0 54 123
inevitably 0 54 123
going 0 54 123
to 0 54 123
go 0 54 123
wrong. 0 54 123

The 0 54 124
pieces 0 54 124
aren’t 0 54 124
going 0 54 124
to 0 54 124
fit 0 54 124
together 0 54 124
perfectly. 0 54 124

The 0 54 125
Mexico 0 54 125
City 0 54 125
operation 0 54 125
is 0 54 125
a 0 54 125
good 0 54 125
example 0 54 125
of 0 54 125
that. 0 54 125

That’s 1 54 126
why 1 54 126
the 1 54 126
CIA 1 54 126
has 1 54 126
to 1 54 126
continue 1 54 126
keeping 1 54 126
those 1 54 126
records 1 54 126
secret. 1 54 126

But 0 54 127
here’s 0 54 127
another 0 54 127
example, 0 54 127
a 0 54 127
small 0 54 127
but 0 54 127
important 0 54 127
one: 0 54 127
Recall 0 54 127
that 0 54 127
Oswald 0 54 127
supposedly 0 54 127
hid 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
rifle 0 54 127
before 0 54 127
he 0 54 127
headed 0 54 127
down 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
steps 0 54 127
from 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
sixth 0 54 127
floor 0 54 127
of 0 54 127
the 0 54 127
school 0 54 127
book 0 54 127
depository. 0 54 127

Ask 0 54 128
yourself: 0 54 128
If 0 54 128
someone 0 54 128
has 0 54 128
just 0 54 128
assassinated 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
president 0 54 128
of 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
United 0 54 128
States, 0 54 128
is 0 54 128
he 0 54 128
really 0 54 128
going 0 54 128
to 0 54 128
take 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
time 0 54 128
to 0 54 128
hide 0 54 128
the 0 54 128
rifle? 0 54 128

What 0 54 129
good 0 54 129
would 0 54 129
that 0 54 129
do? 0 54 129

Wouldn’t 0 54 130
officials 0 54 130
conduct 0 54 130
a 0 54 130
thorough 0 54 130
search 0 54 130
of 0 54 130
the 0 54 130
area? 0 54 130

Wouldn’t 0 54 131
an 0 54 131
assassin 0 54 131
instead 0 54 131
simply 0 54 131
leave 0 54 131
the 0 54 131
rifle 0 54 131
there 0 54 131
and 0 54 131
get 0 54 131
out 0 54 131
of 0 54 131
there 0 54 131
as 0 54 131
soon 0 54 131
as 0 54 131
he 0 54 131
could? 0 54 131

Then 1 54 132
why 1 54 132
the 1 54 132
hidden 1 54 132
rifle? 1 54 132

Because 1 54 133
it’s 1 54 133
consistent 1 54 133
with 1 54 133
a 1 54 133
frame-up. 1 54 133

The 0 54 134
framers 0 54 134
had 0 54 134
to 0 54 134
hide 0 54 134
the 0 54 134
rifle 0 54 134
in 0 54 134
advance 0 54 134
in 0 54 134
a 0 54 134
place 0 54 134
where 0 54 134
no 0 54 134
one 0 54 134
CIA 0 54 134
& 0 54 134
JFK: 0 54 134
The 0 54 134

Morley 0 54 134
Check 0 54 134
Amazon 0 54 134
for 0 54 134
Pricing. 0 54 134

would 0 54 135
see 0 54 135
it 0 54 135
during 0 54 135
the 0 54 135
morning 0 54 135
of 0 54 135
the 0 54 135
assassination, 0 54 135
which 0 54 135
took 0 54 135
place 0 54 135
after 0 54 135
noon. 0 54 135

No 0 54 136
matter 0 54 136
how 0 54 136
good 0 54 136
a 0 54 136
frame-up 0 54 136
was, 0 54 136
the 0 54 136
CIA 0 54 136
knew 0 54 136
that 0 54 136
it 0 54 136
could 0 54 136
be 0 54 136
detected 0 54 136
with 0 54 136
an 0 54 136
aggressive 0 54 136
investigation. 0 54 136

That’s 0 54 137
where 0 54 137
ingenuity 1 54 137
and 1 54 137
cunning 1 54 137
come 1 54 137
into 1 54 137
play. 1 54 137

They 0 54 138
had 0 54 138
to 0 54 138
figure 0 54 138
out 0 54 138
a 0 54 138
way 0 54 138
to 0 54 138
shut 0 54 138
down 0 54 138
the 0 54 138
investigation 0 54 138
so 0 54 138
that 0 54 138
the 0 54 138
frame-up 0 54 138
would 0 54 138
remain 0 54 138
intact. 0 54 138

That’s 1 54 139
why 1 54 139
they 1 54 139
had 1 54 139
shots 1 54 139
fired 1 54 139
from 1 54 139
the 1 54 139
front 1 54 139
and 1 54 139
placed 1 54 139
Oswald 1 54 139
in 1 54 139
the 1 54 139
rear. 1 54 139

The 0 54 140
idea 0 54 140
was 0 54 140
that 0 54 140
since 0 54 140
an 0 54 140
investigation 0 54 140
would 0 54 140
lead 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
Oswald’s 0 54 140
supposed 0 54 140
communist 0 54 140
confederates 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
front, 0 54 140
which 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
turn 0 54 140
would 0 54 140
lead 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
nuclear 0 54 140
war, 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
investigation 0 54 140
had 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
be 0 54 140
shut 0 54 140
down 0 54 140
immediately, 0 54 140
especially 0 54 140
since 0 54 140
it 0 54 140
was 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
CIA 0 54 140
itself 0 54 140
that 0 54 140
had 0 54 140
started 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
assassination 0 54 140
game 0 54 140
by 0 54 140
repeatedly 0 54 140
attempting, 0 54 140
in 0 54 140
partnership 0 54 140
with 0 54 140
the 0 54 140
Mafia, 0 54 140
to 0 54 140
assassinate 0 54 140
Castro. 0 54 140

It 0 54 141
was 0 54 141
one 1 54 141
of 1 54 141
the 1 54 141
most 1 54 141
brilliant 1 54 141
and 1 54 141
cunning 1 54 141
ruses 1 54 141
in 1 54 141
history. 1 54 141

They 0 54 142
get 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
body 0 54 142
out 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
Parkland 0 54 142
by 0 54 142
force, 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
violation 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
Texas 0 54 142
law, 0 54 142
and 0 54 142
put 0 54 142
it 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
hands 0 54 142
of 0 54 142
the 0 54 142
military 0 54 142
in 0 54 142
Maryland, 0 54 142
which 0 54 142
conducts 0 54 142
a 1 54 142
secret 1 54 142
fraudulent 1 54 142
and 1 54 142

concerning 0 58 9

for 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
recklessness, 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
deliberate 0 58 10
ambiguity, 0 58 10
his 0 58 10
fomenting 0 58 10
of 0 58 10

his 0 58 10

of 0 58 10

unheard-of 0 58 10
calumnies 0 58 10
of 0 58 10
the 0 58 10

of 0 58 10

Your 0 58 11
Holiness, 0 58 11
a 1 58 11
chronic 1 58 11
confusion 1 58 11
seems 1 58 11
to 1 58 11
mark 1 58 11
your 1 58 11
pontificate…. 1 58 11

This 0 58 12
fosters 0 58 12
within 0 58 12
the 0 58 12
faithful 0 58 12
a 0 58 12
growing 0 58 12
unease 0 58 12

…. 0 58 13
In 0 58 13
"Amoris 0 58 13
Laetitia," 0 58 13
your 0 58 13
guidance 0 58 13
at 0 58 13
times 0 58 13
seems 0 58 13
intentionally 0 58 13
ambiguous, 0 58 13
thus 0 58 13
inviting 0 58 13
both 0 58 13
a 0 58 13
traditional 0 58 13
interpretation 0 58 13
of 0 58 13
Catholic 0 58 13
teaching 0 58 13
on 0 58 13
marriage 0 58 13
and 0 58 13
divorce 0 58 13
as 0 58 13
well 0 58 13
as 0 58 13
one 0 58 13
that 0 58 13
might 0 58 13
imply 0 58 13
a 0 58 13
change 0 58 13
in 0 58 13
that 0 58 13
teaching…. 0 58 13

To 1 58 14
teach 1 58 14
with 1 58 14
such 1 58 14
a 1 58 14
seemingly 1 58 14
intentional 1 58 14
lack 1 58 14
of 1 58 14
clarity 1 58 14
inevitably 1 58 14
risks 1 58 14
sinning 1 58 14
against 1 58 14
the 1 58 14
Holy 1 58 14
Spirit, 1 58 14
the 1 58 14
Spirit 1 58 14
of 1 58 14
truth. 1 58 14

The 0 58 15
Holy 0 58 15
Spirit 0 58 15
is 0 58 15
given 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
the 0 58 15
Church, 0 58 15
and 0 58 15
particularly 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
yourself, 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
dispel 0 58 15
error, 0 58 15
not 0 58 15
to 0 58 15
foster 0 58 15
it. 0 58 15

[Y]ou 0 58 16
seem 0 58 16
to 0 58 16
censor 0 58 16
and 0 58 16
even 0 58 16
mock 0 58 16
those 0 58 16
who 0 58 16
interpret 0 58 16
Chapter 0 58 16
8 0 58 16
of 0 58 16
"Amoris 0 58 16
Laetitia" 0 58 16
in 0 58 16
accord 0 58 16
with 0 58 16
Church 0 58 16
tradition 0 58 16
as 0 58 16
Pharisaic 1 58 16
stone-throwers 1 58 16
who 1 58 16
embody 1 58 16
a 1 58 16
merciless 1 58 16
rigorism. 1 58 16

This 0 58 17
kind 0 58 17
of 0 58 17
calumny 0 58 17
is 0 58 17
alien 0 58 17
to 0 58 17
the 0 58 17
nature 0 58 17
of 0 58 17
the 0 58 17
Petrine 0 58 17
ministry…. 0 58 17

Such 0 58 18
behavior 0 58 18
gives 0 58 18
the 0 58 18
impression 0 58 18
that 0 58 18
your 0 58 18
views 0 58 18
cannotsurvive 0 58 18
theological 0 58 18
scrutiny, 0 58 18
and 0 58 18
so 0 58 18
must 0 58 18
be 0 58 18
sustained 0 58 18
by 0 58 18
“ad 0 58 18
hominem” 0 58 18
arguments. 0 58 18

[T]oo 0 58 19
often 0 58 19
your 0 58 19
manner 0 58 19
seems 0 58 19
to 0 58 19
demean 0 58 19
the 0 58 19
importance 0 58 19
of 0 58 19
Church 0 58 19
doctrine. 0 58 19

Again 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
again 0 58 20
you 0 58 20
portray 0 58 20
doctrine 0 58 20
as 0 58 20
dead 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
bookish, 0 58 20
and 0 58 20
far 0 58 20
from 0 58 20
the 0 58 20
pastoral 0 58 20
concerns 0 58 20
of 0 58 20
everyday 0 58 20
life. 0 58 20

Your 0 58 21
critics 0 58 21
have 0 58 21
been 0 58 21
accused, 0 58 21
in 0 58 21
your 0 58 21
own 0 58 21
words, 0 58 21
of 0 58 21
making 0 58 21
doctrine 0 58 21
an 0 58 21
ideology. 0 58 21

But 0 58 22
it 0 58 22
is 0 58 22
precisely 0 58 22
Christian 0 58 22
doctrine… 0 58 22
that 0 58 22
frees 0 58 22
people 0 58 22
from 0 58 22
worldly 0 58 22
ideologies 0 58 22
and 0 58 22
assures 0 58 22
that 0 58 22
they 0 58 22
are 0 58 22
actually 0 58 22
preaching 0 58 22
and 0 58 22
teaching 0 58 22
the 0 58 22
authentic, 0 58 22
life-giving 0 58 22
Gospel. 0 58 22

Those 0 58 23
who 0 58 23
devalue 0 58 23
the 0 58 23
doctrines 0 58 23
of 0 58 23
the 0 58 23
Church 0 58 23
[i.e., 0 58 23
Francis!] 0 58 23

separate 0 58 24
themselves 0 58 24
from 0 58 24
Jesus, 0 58 24
the 0 58 24
author 0 58 24
of 0 58 24
truth… 0 58 24
What 0 58 24
they 0 58 24
[i.e., 0 58 24
Francis] 0 58 24
then 0 58 24
possess, 0 58 24
and 0 58 24
can 0 58 24
only 0 58 24
possess, 0 58 24
is 0 58 24
an 0 58 24
ideology 0 58 24
– 0 58 24
one 0 58 24
that 0 58 24
conforms 0 58 24
to 0 58 24
the 0 58 24
world 0 58 24
of 0 58 24
sin 0 58 24
and 0 58 24
death. 0 58 24

[F]aithful 0 58 25
Catholics 0 58 25
can 0 58 25
only 0 58 25
be 0 58 25
disconcerted 0 58 25
by 0 58 25
your 0 58 25
choice 0 58 25
of 0 58 25
some 0 58 25
bishops, 0 58 25
men 0 58 25
who 0 58 25
seem 0 58 25
not 0 58 25
merely 0 58 25
open 0 58 25
to 0 58 25
those 0 58 25
who 0 58 25
hold 0 58 25
views 0 58 25
counter 0 58 25
to 0 58 25
Christian 0 58 25
belief 0 58 25
but 0 58 25
who 0 58 25
support 0 58 25
and 0 58 25
even 0 58 25
defend 0 58 25
them. 0 58 25

What 0 58 26
scandalizes 0 58 26
believers, 0 58 26
and 0 58 26
even 0 58 26
some 0 58 26
fellow 0 58 26
bishops, 0 58 26
is 0 58 26
not 0 58 26
only 0 58 26
your 0 58 26
having 0 58 26
appointed 0 58 26
such 0 58 26
men 0 58 26
to 0 58 26
be 0 58 26
shepherds 0 58 26
of 0 58 26
the 0 58 26
Church, 0 58 26
but 0 58 26
that 0 58 26
you 0 58 26
also 0 58 26
seem 0 58 26
silent 0 58 26
in 0 58 26
the 0 58 26
face 0 58 26
of 0 58 26
their 0 58 26
teaching 0 58 26
and 0 58 26
pastoral 0 58 26
practice…. 0 58 26

As 0 58 27
a 0 58 27
result, 0 58 27
many 0 58 27
of 0 58 27
the 0 58 27
faithful, 0 58 27
who 0 58 27
embody 0 58 27
the 0 58 27
"sensus 0 58 27
fidelium," 0 58 27
are 0 58 27
losing 0 58 27
confidence 0 58 27
in 0 58 27
their 0 58 27
supreme 0 58 27
shepherd. 0 58 27

[T]he 0 58 28
Church 0 58 28
is 0 58 28
one 0 58 28
body, 0 58 28
the 0 58 28
Mystical 0 58 28
Body 0 58 28
of 0 58 28
Christ, 0 58 28
and 0 58 28
you 0 58 28
are 0 58 28
commissioned 0 58 28
by 0 58 28
the 0 58 28
Lord 0 58 28
himself 0 58 28
to 0 58 28
promote 0 58 28
and 0 58 28
strengthen 0 58 28
her 0 58 28
unity. 0 58 28

But 0 58 29
your 0 58 29
actions 0 58 29
and 0 58 29
words 0 58 29
too 0 58 29
often 0 58 29
seem 0 58 29
intent 0 58 29
on 0 58 29
doing 0 58 29
the 0 58 29
opposite…. 0 58 29

You 0 58 30
have 0 58 30
often 0 58 30
spoken 0 58 30
about 0 58 30
the 0 58 30
need 0 58 30
for 0 58 30
transparency 0 58 30
within 0 58 30
the 0 58 30
Church. 0 58 30

You 0 58 31
have 0 58 31
frequently 0 58 31
encouraged… 0 58 31
all 0 58 31
persons, 0 58 31
especially 0 58 31
bishops, 0 58 31
to 0 58 31
speak 0 58 31
their 0 58 31
mind 0 58 31
and 0 58 31
not 0 58 31
be 0 58 31
fearful 0 58 31
of 0 58 31
what 0 58 31
the 0 58 31
pope 0 58 31
may 0 58 31
think. 0 58 31

But… 0 58 32
what 0 58 32
many 0 58 32
[bishops] 0 58 32
have 0 58 32
learned 0 58 32
from 0 58 32
your 0 58 32
pontificate 0 58 32
is 0 58 32
not 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
you 0 58 32
are 0 58 32
open 0 58 32
to 0 58 32
criticism, 0 58 32
but 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
you 0 58 32
resent 0 58 32
it… 0 58 32
Many 0 58 32
fear 0 58 32
that 0 58 32
if 0 58 32
they 0 58 32
speak 0 58 32
their 0 58 32
mind, 0 58 32
they 0 58 32
will 0 58 32
be 0 58 32
marginalized 0 58 32
or 0 58 32
worse. 0 58 32

I 0 58 33
have 0 58 33
often 0 58 33
asked 0 58 33
myself: 0 58 33
"Why 0 58 33
has 0 58 33
Jesus 0 58 33
let 0 58 33
all 0 58 33
of 0 58 33
this 0 58 33
happen?" 0 58 33

The 1 58 34
only 1 58 34
answer 1 58 34
that 1 58 34
comes 1 58 34
to 1 58 34
mind 1 58 34
is 1 58 34
that 1 58 34
Jesus 1 58 34
wants 1 58 34
to 1 58 34
manifest 1 58 34
just 1 58 34
how 1 58 34
weak 1 58 34
is 1 58 34
the 1 58 34
faith 1 58 34
of 1 58 34
many 1 58 34
within 1 58 34
the 1 58 34
Church, 1 58 34
even 1 58 34
among 1 58 34
too 1 58 34
many 1 58 34
of 1 58 34
her 1 58 34
bishops. 1 58 34

Ironically, 1 58 35
your 1 58 35
pontificate 1 58 35
has 1 58 35
given 1 58 35
those 1 58 35
who 1 58 35
hold 1 58 35
harmful 1 58 35
theological 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
pastoral 1 58 35
views 1 58 35
the 1 58 35
license 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
confidence 1 58 35
to 1 58 35
come 1 58 35
into 1 58 35
the 1 58 35
light 1 58 35
and 1 58 35
expose 1 58 35
their 1 58 35
previously 1 58 35
hidden 1 58 35
darkness…. 1 58 35

Father 0 58 36
Weinandy 0 58 36
reveals 0 58 36
that 0 58 36
he 0 58 36
decided 0 58 36
to 0 58 36
publicize 0 58 36
this 0 58 36
historic 0 58 36
missive 0 58 36
only 0 58 36
after 0 58 36
receiving 0 58 36
an 0 58 36
unmistakable 0 58 36
sign 0 58 36
from 0 58 36
heaven. 0 58 36

As 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
recounts 0 58 37
here, 0 58 37
after 0 58 37
repeatedly 0 58 37
“beseeching 0 58 37
Jesus 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
Mary, 0 58 37
St. 0 58 37

and 0 58 37
all 0 58 37
of 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
saintly 0 58 37
popes 0 58 37
who 0 58 37
are 0 58 37
buried 0 58 37
there 0 58 37
to 0 58 37

something 0 58 37
to 0 58 37
rectify 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
confusion 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
turmoil 0 58 37
within 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
Church 0 58 37
today, 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
chaos 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
an 0 58 37
uncertainty 0 58 37
that 0 58 37
I 0 58 37
felt 0 58 37
Pope 0 58 37
Francis 0 58 37
had 0 58 37
himself 0 58 37
caused,” 0 58 37
he 0 58 37
asked 0 58 37
for 0 58 37

that 0 58 37
the 0 58 37

he 0 58 37
would 0 58 37

someone 0 58 37
he 0 58 37

in 0 58 37
a 0 58 37
very 0 58 37

to 0 58 37

in 0 58 37
Rome, 0 58 37
and 0 58 37
was 0 58 37
not 0 58 37
from 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
United 0 58 37
States, 0 58 37
Canada 0 58 37
or 0 58 37
Great 0 58 37
Britain, 0 58 37
which 0 58 37
person 0 58 37
would 0 58 37
utter 0 58 37
the 0 58 37
particular 0 58 37

“Keep 0 58 37
up 0 58 37

the 0 58 38
next 0 58 38
day, 0 58 38
the 0 58 38
sign 0 58 38
was 0 58 38
given. 0 58 38

An 0 58 39
old 0 58 39

he 0 58 39
had 0 58 39
not 0 58 39
seen 0 58 39
in 0 58 39
more 0 58 39
than 0 58 39
twenty 0 58 39

would 0 58 39
never 0 58 39
have 0 58 39
expected 0 58 39
to 0 58 39
meet 0 58 39
in 0 58 39
Rome, 0 58 39
who 0 58 39
is 0 58 39
now 0 58 39
an 0 58 39
archbishop, 0 58 39
appeared 0 58 39
suddenly 0 58 39
from 0 58 39
between 0 58 39
two 0 58 39
parked 0 58 39
cars, 0 58 39
renewed 0 58 39
acquaintances 0 58 39
and, 0 58 39
referring 0 58 39
to 0 58 39
one 0 58 39
of 0 58 39
Father 0 58 39
Weinandy’s 0 58 39
books, 0 58 39
said: 0 58 39
“Keep 0 58 39
up 0 58 39
the 0 58 39
good 0 58 39
writing.” 0 58 39

Writes 0 58 40

Fr. 0 58 41
Weinandy: 0 58 41
“I 0 58 41
could 0 58 41
hardly 0 58 41
believe 0 58 41
that 0 58 41
this 0 58 41
just 0 58 41
happened 0 58 41
in 0 58 41
a 0 58 41
matter 0 58 41
of 0 58 41
a 0 58 41
few 0 58 41
minutes. 0 58 41

But 0 58 42
there 0 58 42
was 0 58 42
no 0 58 42
longer 0 58 42
any 0 58 42
doubt 0 58 42
in 0 58 42
my 0 58 42
mind 0 58 42
that 0 58 42
Jesus 0 58 42
wanted 0 58 42
me 0 58 42
to 0 58 42
write 0 58 42
something. 0 58 42

I 0 58 43
also 0 58 43
think 0 58 43
it 0 58 43
significant 0 58 43
that 0 58 43
it 0 58 43
was 0 58 43
an 0 58 43
Archbishop 0 58 43
that 0 58 43
Jesus 0 58 43
used. 0 58 43

I 0 58 44
considered 0 58 44
it 0 58 44
an 0 58 44
apostolic 0 58 44
mandate.” 0 58 44

Can 0 58 45
we 0 58 45
doubt 0 58 45
that 0 58 45
it 0 58 45
was 0 58 45
indeed 0 58 45
an 0 58 45
apostolic 0 58 45
mandate? 0 58 45

Can 0 58 46
we 0 58 46
not 0 58 46

Leftists 0 279 42
have 0 279 42
said 0 279 42
the 0 279 42
connection 0 279 42
is 0 279 42
unfair, 0 279 42
because 0 279 42
Waters’ 0 279 42
was 0 279 42
only 0 279 42
calling 0 279 42

My 0 279 43
question 0 279 43
is; 0 279 43
how 0 279 43
big 0 279 43
of 0 279 43
a 0 279 43
leap 0 279 43
would 0 279 43
it 0 279 43
be 0 279 43
for 0 279 43
a 0 279 43
normal, 0 279 43
rational 0 279 43
adult 0 279 43
to 0 279 43
go 0 279 43
from 0 279 43
confronting 0 279 43
administration 0 279 43
officials 0 279 43
to 0 279 43
attacking 0 279 43
the 0 279 43
people 0 279 43
who 0 279 43
elected 0 279 43
them 0 279 43
to 0 279 43
power? 0 279 43

Not 0 279 44
much 0 279 44
in 0 279 44
my 0 279 44
mind. 0 279 44

The 0 279 45
reality 0 279 45
is 0 279 45
that 0 279 45
the 0 279 45
Democrats 0 279 45
are 0 279 45
as 0 279 45
much 0 279 45

the 0 279 45

replied. 0 280 18

I 0 280 19
said, 0 280 19
"Mom, 0 280 19
when 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
in 0 280 19
the 1 280 19
rock 1 280 19
n 1 280 19
roll 1 280 19
world 1 280 19
doing 0 280 19
the 0 280 19
things 0 280 19
that 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
doing, 0 280 19
nobody 0 280 19
said 0 280 19
anything, 0 280 19
and 0 280 19
no 0 280 19
one 0 280 19
had 0 280 19
a 0 280 19
problem 0 280 19
with 0 280 19
what 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
was 0 280 19
doing, 0 280 19
that 0 280 19
is 0 280 19
until 0 280 19
I 0 280 19
started 0 280 19
to 0 280 19
emulate 0 280 19
(obey) 0 280 19
Jesus 0 280 19
Christ" 0 280 19
(1 0 280 19
John 0 280 19
2:6). 0 280 19

This 0 280 20
reminds 0 280 20
me 0 280 20
of 0 280 20
when 0 280 20
I 0 280 20
gave 0 280 20
a 0 280 20
prayer 0 280 20
at 0 280 20
the 0 280 20
state 0 280 20
capital 0 280 20
in 0 280 20
Minnesota. 0 280 20

After 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
prayer 0 280 21
was 0 280 21
over, 0 280 21
I 0 280 21
had 0 280 21
a 0 280 21
minister 0 280 21
come 0 280 21
up 0 280 21
to 0 280 21
me 0 280 21
and 0 280 21
tell 0 280 21
me 0 280 21
that 0 280 21
I 0 280 21
could 0 280 21
not 0 280 21
be 0 280 21
dropping 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
“J” 0 280 21
(Jesus) 0 280 21
word 0 280 21
in 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
capital. 0 280 21

I 0 280 22
said 0 280 22
that 0 280 22
the 1 280 22
reason 1 280 22
I 1 280 22
dropped 1 280 22
the 1 280 22
“J” 1 280 22
word 1 280 22
was 1 280 22
because 1 280 22
you 1 280 22
haven’t 1 280 22
in 1 280 22
40 1 280 22
years 1 280 22
(Romans 0 280 22
1:16). 0 280 22

What 0 280 23
of 0 280 23
public 0 280 23
high 0 280 23
schools 0 280 23
across 0 280 23
the 0 280 23
country 0 280 23
that 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
have 0 280 23
been 0 280 23
going 0 280 23
into 0 280 23
in 0 280 23
order 0 280 23
to 0 280 23
educate 0 280 23
the 0 280 23
youth 0 280 23
as 0 280 23
to 0 280 23
who 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
are, 0 280 23
and 0 280 23
not 0 280 23
what 0 280 23
the 1 280 23
revisionists 1 280 23
and 1 280 23
propagandists 1 280 23
would 0 280 23
have 0 280 23
them 0 280 23
believe 0 280 23
that 0 280 23
we 0 280 23
are. 0 280 23

We 0 280 24
have 0 280 24
shown 0 280 24
the 0 280 24
young 0 280 24
people 0 280 24
that 0 280 24
abortion 1 280 24
is 1 280 24
murder 1 280 24
and 1 280 24
that 1 280 24
58 1 280 24
million 1 280 24
babies 1 280 24
have 1 280 24
been 1 280 24
murdered 1 280 24
since 1 280 24
1973 1 280 24
under 1 280 24
the 1 280 24
guise 1 280 24
of 1 280 24
woman’s 1 280 24
choice 1 280 24
(Proverbs 0 280 24
6:17). 0 280 24

We 1 280 25
got 1 280 25
kicked 1 280 25
out 1 280 25
of 1 280 25
a 1 280 25
public 1 280 25
school 1 280 25
for 1 280 25
re-enforcing 1 280 25
America’s 1 280 25
value’s 1 280 25
by 1 280 25
teaching 1 280 25
the 1 280 25
US 1 280 25
Constitution. 1 280 25

We 0 280 26
have 0 280 26
taught 0 280 26
that 0 280 26
homosexuality 1 280 26
is 1 280 26
an 1 280 26
abomination, 1 280 26
and 0 280 26
how 0 280 26
it 0 280 26
is 0 280 26
a 0 280 26
felony 0 280 26
in 0 280 26
every 0 280 26
state 0 280 26
in 0 280 26
our 0 280 26
union 0 280 26
(Leviticus 0 280 26
18:22; 0 280 26
20:13; 0 280 26
Jude 0 280 26
1:7). 0 280 26

How 0 280 27
true 0 280 27
Scripture 0 280 27
is 0 280 27
when 0 280 27
it 0 280 27
declares: 0 280 27

“Woe 0 280 28
unto 0 280 28
them 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
call 0 280 28
evil 0 280 28
good, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
good 0 280 28
evil; 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
put 0 280 28
darkness 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
light, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
light 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
darkness; 0 280 28
that 0 280 28
put 0 280 28
bitter 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
sweet, 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
sweet 0 280 28
for 0 280 28
bitter!" 0 280 28

No 0 280 29
wonder 0 280 29
why 0 280 29
the 1 280 29
reprobates 1 280 29
and 1 280 29
hypocrites 1 280 29
thought 0 280 29
that 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
Christians 0 280 29
who 0 280 29
were 0 280 29
following 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
living 0 280 29
Christ 0 280 29
were 0 280 29
turning 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
world 0 280 29
upside 0 280 29
down 0 280 29
in 0 280 29
the 0 280 29
book 0 280 29
of 0 280 29
Acts. 0 280 29

They 0 280 30
were, 0 280 30
in 0 280 30
fact, 0 280 30
turning 0 280 30
the 0 280 30
world 0 280 30
right 0 280 30
side 0 280 30
up 0 280 30
(Acts 0 280 30
17:6). 0 280 30

Identifying 0 280 31
the 0 280 31
genuine 0 280 31
from 0 280 31
the 0 280 31
counterfeit 0 280 31

Last 0 280 32
week, 0 280 32
I 0 280 32
had 0 280 32
a 0 280 32
woman 0 280 32
come 0 280 32
up 0 280 32
to 0 280 32
me 0 280 32
at 0 280 32
my 0 280 32
last 0 280 32
meeting 0 280 32
in 0 280 32
Amery, 0 280 32
Wisconsin. 0 280 32

She 0 280 33
said 0 280 33
that 0 280 33
she 0 280 33
did 0 280 33
her 0 280 33
research 0 280 33
on 0 280 33
me 0 280 33
and 0 280 33
said 0 280 33
that 0 280 33
the 0 280 33
media 0 280 33
really 0 280 33
attacked 0 280 33
me. 0 280 33

I 0 280 34
responded 0 280 34
with, 0 280 34
"Of 1 280 34
course 1 280 34
they 1 280 34
did, 1 280 34
and 1 280 34
of 1 280 34
course 1 280 34
they 1 280 34
still 1 280 34
do." 1 280 34

They 1 280 35
are 1 280 35
being 1 280 35
exposed 1 280 35
for 1 280 35
who 1 280 35
they 1 280 35
are 1 280 35
and 1 280 35
they 1 280 35
do 1 280 35
not 1 280 35
like 1 280 35
it. 1 280 35

(John 0 280 36
15:22). 0 280 36

I 0 280 37
told 0 280 37
her 0 280 37
that 0 280 37
there 0 280 37
are 0 280 37
too 0 280 37
many 0 280 37
counterfeits, 1 280 37
self-proclaimed 1 280 37
leaders, 1 280 37
out 0 280 37
there 0 280 37
who 1 280 37
care 1 280 37
more 1 280 37
about 1 280 37
saving 1 280 37
face, 1 280 37
than 1 280 37
they 1 280 37
do 1 280 37
the 1 280 37
souls 1 280 37
of 1 280 37
men 1 280 37
(Luke 1 280 37
19:10), 1 280 37
as 1 280 37
well 1 280 37
as 1 280 37
saving 1 280 37
their 1 280 37
country. 1 280 37

Apparently 0 280 38
they 0 280 38
have 0 280 38
a 0 280 38
reputation 0 280 38
to 0 280 38
keep 0 280 38
up. 0 280 38

Philippians 0 280 39
2:7-9 0 280 39

These 0 280 40
are 0 280 40
those 0 280 40
that 0 280 40
sit 0 280 40
behind 0 280 40
the 0 280 40
status 0 280 40
of 0 280 40
some 0 280 40
sort 0 280 40
of 0 280 40
church 0 280 40
or 0 280 40
political 1 280 40
leader 1 280 40
of 1 280 40
the 1 280 40
pack. 1 280 40

Yet, 1 280 41
you 1 280 41
do 1 280 41
not 1 280 41
see 1 280 41
any 1 280 41
warfare 1 280 41
or 1 280 41
opposition 1 280 41
around 1 280 41
them 1 280 41
and 1 280 41
why? 1 280 41

because 1 280 42
they 1 280 42
have 1 280 42
simply 1 280 42
forsaken 1 280 42
the 1 280 42
cross. 1 280 42

There 0 280 43
is 0 280 43
no 0 280 43
absolutes 0 280 43
with 0 280 43
these 0 280 43
people. 0 280 43

They 1 280 44
are 1 280 44
people 1 280 44
pleasers 1 280 44
and 1 280 44
nothing 1 280 44
more. 1 280 44

After 0 280 45
all 0 280 45
you 0 280 45
can 0 280 45
always 0 280 45
tell 0 280 45
what 0 280 45
a 0 280 45
man 0 280 45
stands 0 280 45
for 0 280 45
by 0 280 45
the 0 280 45
enemies 0 280 45
that 0 280 45
he 0 280 45
has. 0 280 45

They 0 280 46
hide 1 280 46
behind 1 280 46
a 1 280 46
microphone 1 280 46
day 0 280 46
after 0 280 46
day. 0 280 46

Yet, 0 280 47
they 0 280 47
fail 0 280 47
to 0 280 47
confront 0 280 47
the 0 280 47
issues 0 280 47
that 0 280 47
needed 0 280 47
to 0 280 47
be 0 280 47
confronted. 0 280 47

The 1 280 48
reason 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
don't 1 280 48
is 1 280 48
because 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
are 1 280 48
guilty 1 280 48
of 1 280 48
what 1 280 48
they 1 280 48
fail 1 280 48
to 1 280 48
confront! 1 280 48

They 0 280 49
are 0 280 49
paper 1 280 49
tigers. 1 280 49

They 1 280 50
can 1 280 50
write 1 280 50
all 1 280 50
big 1 280 50
and 1 280 50
bad 1 280 50
but 1 280 50
when 1 280 50
it 1 280 50
comes 1 280 50
to 1 280 50
what 1 280 50
someone 1 280 50
else 1 280 50
should 1 280 50
do. 1 280 50

However, 1 280 51
when 1 280 51
it 1 280 51
is 1 280 51
time 1 280 51
for 1 280 51
them 1 280 51
to 1 280 51
put 1 280 51
boots 1 280 51
on 1 280 51
the 1 280 51
ground, 1 280 51
they 1 280 51
are 1 280 51
simply 1 280 51
missing 1 280 51
in 1 280 51
action 1 280 51
(MIA). 1 280 51

These 0 280 52
are 0 280 52
willing 0 280 52
to 1 280 52
live 1 280 52
in 1 280 52
the 1 280 52
freest 1 280 52
country 1 280 52
in 1 280 52
the 1 280 52
world 1 280 52
as 0 280 52
long 0 280 52
as 0 280 52
it 0 280 52
is 0 280 52
not 0 280 52
them 0 280 52
that 0 280 52
have 0 280 52
to 0 280 52
sacrifice 0 280 52
to 0 280 52
maintain 0 280 52
it. 0 280 52

There 0 280 53
is 0 280 53
also 0 280 53
a 0 280 53
group 0 280 53
of 0 280 53
people 0 280 53
out 0 280 53
there 0 280 53
that 0 280 53
have 0 280 53
to 0 280 53
be 0 280 53
friends 0 280 53
with 0 280 53
everyone 0 280 53
(and 0 280 53
have 0 280 53
to 0 280 53
apologize 0 280 53
to 0 280 53
any 0 280 53
that 0 280 53
they 0 280 53
may 0 280 53
have 0 280 53
told 0 280 53
the 0 280 53
truth 0 280 53
lest 0 280 53
they 0 280 53
should 0 280 53
convict 1 280 53
them 1 280 53
unto 1 280 53
godly 1 280 53
repentance 1 280 53
(2 0 280 53
Corinthians 0 280 53
7:10) 0 280 53
as 0 280 53
they 0 280 53
congregate 0 280 53
week 0 280 53
after 0 280 53
week 0 280 53
deceiving 1 280 53
themselves 1 280 53
into 1 280 53
believing 1 280 53
that 1 280 53
they 1 280 53
are 1 280 53
demanding 1 280 53
a 1 280 53
lawful 1 280 53
change 1 280 53
just 1 280 53
as 1 280 53
long 1 280 53
as 1 280 53
it 1 280 53
does 1 280 53
not 1 280 53
offend 1 280 53
anyone 1 280 53
(Matthew 0 280 53
5:10). 0 280 53

As 0 280 54
a 0 280 54
matter 0 280 54
of 0 280 54
fact, 0 280 54
these 1 280 54
counterfeits 1 280 54
will 1 280 54
be 1 280 54
the 1 280 54
first 1 280 54
ones 1 280 54
to 1 280 54
get 1 280 54
angry 1 280 54
with 1 280 54
and 1 280 54
denounce 1 280 54
and 1 280 54

the 1 280 54
ones 1 280 54
that 1 280 54
are 1 280 54
sent 1 280 54
by 1 280 54
the 1 280 54
Spirit 1 280 54
of 1 280 54
God 1 280 54
(Galatians 0 280 54

Maybe 0 280 55
this 0 280 55
group 0 280 55
of 0 280 55
people 0 280 55
should 0 280 55
ask 0 280 55
their 0 280 55
enemies 0 280 55
for 0 280 55
instructions 0 280 55
as 0 280 55
to 0 280 55
how 0 280 55
change 0 280 55
is 0 280 55
brought 0 280 55
about, 0 280 55
and 0 280 55
in 1 280 55
a 1 280 55
righteous 1 280 55
sense 1 280 55
reverse 1 280 55
the 1 280 55
lawlessness-taking 1 280 55
place 0 280 55
in 0 280 55
this 0 280 55
country 0 280 55
(Matthew 0 280 55
24:12). 0 280 55

These 1 280 56
groups 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
people 1 280 56
are 1 280 56
simply 1 280 56
enemies 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
the 1 280 56
cross 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
Christ 1 280 56
and 1 280 56
know 1 280 56
not 1 280 56
the 1 280 56
power 1 280 56
of 1 280 56
God 1 280 56
unto 1 280 56
salvation 1 280 56
(Philippians 0 280 56
3:18). 0 280 56

Furthermore, 0 280 57
I 0 280 57
said 0 280 57
to 0 280 57
this 0 280 57
woman 0 280 57
that 0 280 57
this 0 280 57
is 0 280 57
how 0 280 57
you 0 280 57
can 0 280 57
tell 0 280 57
who 0 280 57
the 1 280 57
genuine 1 280 57
Christians 1 280 57
are 0 280 57
that 0 280 57
are 0 280 57
in 0 280 57
the 0 280 57
fight 0 280 57
and 0 280 57
those 1 280 57
who 1 280 57
are 1 280 57
counterfeits. 1 280 57

When 0 280 58
the 0 280 58
church 0 280 58
and 0 280 58
the 0 280 58
world 0 280 58
can 0 280 58
jog 1 280 58
comfortably 1 280 58
along 1 280 58
together, 1 280 58
you 0 280 58
can 0 280 58
be 0 280 58
sure 0 280 58
something 0 280 58
is 0 280 58
wrong. 0 280 58

The 0 280 59
world 0 280 59
has 0 280 59
not 0 280 59
compromised—its 0 280 59
spirit 0 280 59
is 0 280 59
exactly 0 280 59
the 0 280 59
same 0 280 59
as 0 280 59
it 0 280 59
ever 0 280 59
was. 0 280 59

If 1 280 60
Christians 1 280 60
were 1 280 60
equally 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
faithful 1 280 60
to 1 280 60
the 1 280 60
Lord, 1 280 60
separated 1 280 60

and 1 280 60
living 1 280 60
so 1 280 60
that 1 280 60
their 1 280 60

were 1 280 60
a 1 280 60
reproof 1 280 60
to 1 280 60
all 1 280 60
ungodliness, 1 280 60
the 1 280 60

would 1 280 60
hate 1 280 60
them 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
much 1 280 60
as 1 280 60
it 1 280 60
ever 1 280 60
did. 1 280 60

(John 0 280 61

It 0 280 61
is 0 280 61
the 0 280 61

At 0 286 10
the 0 286 10
Hammonds’ 0 286 10
original 0 286 10
sentencing, 0 286 10
the 0 286 10
judge 0 286 10
noted 0 286 10
that 0 286 10
they 0 286 10
are 0 286 10
respected 0 286 10
in 0 286 10
the 0 286 10

minimum, 0 286 10
5-year 0 286 10

sentence 0 286 10
would 0 286 10
“shock 1 286 10

be 0 286 10
“grossly 1 286 10
disproportionate 1 286 10
to 1 286 10
the 1 286 10
severity” 1 286 10
of 0 286 10

conduct. 0 286 10

As 0 286 11
a 0 286 11
result, 0 286 11
the 0 286 11
judge 0 286 11
imposed 0 286 11
significantly 0 286 11
lesser 0 286 11

The 0 286 12
previous 0 286 12
administration, 0 286 12
however, 0 286 12
filed 0 286 12
an 0 286 12
overzealous 1 286 12
appeal 0 286 12
that 0 286 12
resulted 0 286 12

their 0 286 18

At 0 288 17
the 0 288 17
Hammonds’ 0 288 17
original 0 288 17
sentencing, 0 288 17
the 0 288 17
judge 0 288 17
noted 0 288 17
that 0 288 17
they 0 288 17
are 0 288 17
respected 0 288 17
in 0 288 17

minimum, 0 288 17
5-year 0 288 17

“shock 1 288 17
the 1 288 17

be 0 288 17
“grossly 1 288 17
disproportionate 1 288 17
to 1 288 17
the 1 288 17
severity” 1 288 17
of 0 288 17
their 0 288 17
conduct. 0 288 17

As 0 288 18
a 0 288 18
result, 0 288 18
the 0 288 18
judge 0 288 18
imposed 0 288 18
significantly 0 288 18
lesser 0 288 18
sentences. 0 288 18

The 0 288 19
previous 0 288 19
administration, 0 288 19
however, 0 288 19
filed 0 288 19
an 0 288 19
overzealous 1 288 19
appeal 0 288 19
that 0 288 19
resulted 0 288 19
in 0 288 19
the 0 288 19

five 0 288 19
years 0 288 19

This 0 288 20

thank 0 288 26
you 0 288 26
President 0 288 26

You 0 288 27
did 0 288 27
the 0 288 27
right 0 288 27
thing 0 288 27
in 0 288 27
this 0 288 27

And 0 288 28
for 0 288 28
all 0 288 28
those 0 288 28
who 0 288 28
took 0 288 28
the 0 288 28

keep 0 288 28

to 0 288 28
petition 0 288 28
the 0 288 28

the 0 288 28
Hammonds, 0 288 28
thank 0 288 28
you! 0 288 28

It 0 288 29
should 0 288 29
be 0 288 29

that 0 288 29
the 0 288 29

that 0 288 29
took 0 288 29
place 0 288 29
in 0 288 29

a 0 288 29
couple 0 288 29

were 0 288 29

to 0 288 29
the 0 288 29
injustice 1 288 29
the 0 288 29

faced. 0 288 29

Robert 0 288 30

Those 0 288 31

were 0 288 31
all 0 288 31
acquitted 0 288 31

all 0 288 31

dismissed. 0 288 31

No 0 288 32

Finicum 0 288 32
would 0 288 32
have 0 288 32
been 0 288 32

guilty 0 288 32
as 0 288 32
well, 0 288 32
but 0 288 32
that's 0 288 32
not 0 288 32
how 0 288 32

is 0 288 32

to 0 290 15

But 0 290 17
a 0 290 17

a 0 290 17
second 0 290 17

This 0 290 18

dragged 0 290 18

hit 1 290 19
with 0 290 19
hate 0 290 19

charges. 0 290 19

Then 0 290 20
they 0 290 20
were 0 290 20
dropped. 0 290 20

The 1 290 21
authorities 1 290 21
allowed 1 290 21
him 1 290 21
to 1 290 21
commit 1 290 21
the 1 290 21
crime. 1 290 21

Now 0 290 22
they're 0 290 22
letting 0 290 22
him 0 290 22
get 0 290 22
away 0 290 22
with 0 290 22
it. 0 290 22

Three 0 290 23

of 0 290 23
the 0 290 23
Anti-Crime 0 290 23

patrolling 0 290 23
the 0 290 23
area 0 290 23

took 0 290 23
up 0 290 23
position 0 290 23
in 0 290 23
front 0 290 23
of 0 290 23

They 0 290 24
heard 0 290 24
Kobili 0 290 24
Traore 0 290 24
chanting 0 290 24
Muslim 0 290 24
prayers 0 290 24

Koranic 0 290 24

Unsure 0 290 25
about 0 290 25

the 0 290 25

the 0 290 25
family, 0 290 25
they 0 290 25
asked 0 290 25
for 0 290 25
reinforcements. 0 290 25

Additional 0 290 26
policemen 0 290 26
arrived 0 290 26
quickly. 0 290 26

However, 0 290 27
for 0 290 27
some 0 290 27
unclear 0 290 27
reason, 0 290 27
the 0 290 27
BAC 0 290 27
unit 0 290 27
still 0 290 27
refrained 0 290 27
from 0 290 27
breaking 0 290 27
in. 0 290 27

In 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
meantime, 0 290 28
Kobili 0 290 28
Traore 0 290 28
put 0 290 28
on 0 290 28
new 0 290 28
clothes 0 290 28
and 0 290 28
climbed 0 290 28
out 0 290 28
of 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
window 0 290 28
to 0 290 28
reach 0 290 28
Sarah 0 290 28
Halimi’s 0 290 28
apartment, 0 290 28
which 0 290 28
was 0 290 28
at 0 290 28
the 0 290 28
same 0 290 28
level 0 290 28
as 0 290 28
Diara 0 290 28
Traore’s. 0 290 28

He 0 290 29
allegedly 0 290 29
assaulted 0 290 29
the 0 290 29
Jewish 0 290 29
woman 0 290 29
and 0 290 29
hit 1 290 29
her 1 290 29
mercilessly. 1 290 29

From 0 290 30
time 0 290 30
to 0 290 30
time 0 290 30
he 0 290 30
resumed 0 290 30
Koranic 0 290 30
recitation. 0 290 30

Many 0 290 31
neighbours, 0 290 31
woken 0 290 31
by 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
old 0 290 31
woman’s 0 290 31
screams 0 290 31
or 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
assaulter’s 0 290 31
religious 0 290 31
chanting, 0 290 31
called 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
police 0 290 31
Some 0 290 31
gave 0 290 31
details 0 290 31
about 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
exact 0 290 31
location 0 290 31
of 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
assault, 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
attacker’s 0 290 31
identity, 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
fact 0 290 31
he 0 290 31
vilified 0 290 31
his 0 290 31
victim 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
a 0 290 31
Jewish 0 290 31
person 0 290 31
and 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
“a 1 290 31
Satan” 1 290 31
while 0 290 31
hitting 0 290 31
her, 0 290 31
or 0 290 31
even 0 290 31
— 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
far 0 290 31
as 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
Muslim 0 290 31
neighbours 0 290 31
were 0 290 31
concerned 0 290 31
— 0 290 31
the 0 290 31
Koranic 0 290 31
portions 0 290 31
he 0 290 31
chanted. 0 290 31

Yet 0 290 32
the 0 290 32
police 0 290 32
still 0 290 32
failed 0 290 32
to 0 290 32

Sarah 0 290 32
Halimi’s 0 290 32
apartment 0 290 32
and 0 290 32

her. 0 290 32

Eventually, 0 290 33
Kobili 0 290 33
Traore 0 290 33
is 0 290 33
claimed 0 290 33
to 0 290 33
have 0 290 33
shouted 0 290 33
that 0 290 33
the 0 290 33
woman 0 290 33
was 0 290 33
“mad 0 290 33
and 0 290 33
about 0 290 33
to 0 290 33
commit 0 290 33
suicide”, 0 290 33
and 0 290 33
threw 0 290 33
her 0 290 33
out 0 290 33
of 0 290 33
the 0 290 33

information. 0 293 18

Clearly, 1 293 19
they 1 293 19
were 1 293 19
acting 1 293 19
unlawfully 1 293 19
when 1 293 19
they 1 293 19
did 1 293 19
what 1 293 19
they 1 293 19
did. 1 293 19

"I 0 293 20
thought 1 293 20
my 1 293 20
life 1 293 20
was 1 293 20
over," 1 293 20
Wilson 0 293 20
said 0 293 20
after 0 293 20
his 0 293 20
attorneys 0 293 20
told 0 293 20
him 0 293 20
he 0 293 20
didn't 0 293 20
fair 0 293 20
well 0 293 20
going 0 293 20
up 0 293 20
against 0 293 20
the 0 293 20
government. 0 293 20

So, 0 293 21
what 0 293 21
did 0 293 21
he 0 293 21
do? 0 293 21

He 0 293 22
fired 0 293 22
them, 0 293 22
and 0 293 22
got 0 293 22
a 0 293 22
new 0 293 22
legal 0 293 22
team. 0 293 22

Wired 0 293 23
has 0 293 23
the 0 293 23
story. 0 293 23

Instead, 0 293 24
Wilson 0 293 24
has 0 293 24
spent 0 293 24
the 0 293 24
last 0 293 24
years 0 293 24
on 0 293 24
an 0 293 24
unlikely 0 293 24
project 0 293 24
for 0 293 24
an 1 293 24
anarchist: 1 293 24
Not 0 293 24
simply 0 293 24
defying 0 293 24
or 0 293 24
skirting 0 293 24
the 0 293 24
law 0 293 24
but 0 293 24
taking 0 293 24
it 0 293 24
to 0 293 24
court 0 293 24
and 0 293 24
changing 0 293 24
it. 0 293 24

In 0 293 25
doing 0 293 25
so, 0 293 25
he 0 293 25
has 0 293 25
now 0 293 25
not 0 293 25
only 0 293 25
defeated 0 293 25
a 0 293 25
legal 0 293 25
threat 0 293 25
to 0 293 25
his 0 293 25
own 0 293 25
highly 0 293 25
controversial 0 293 25
gunsmithing 0 293 25
project. 0 293 25

He 0 293 26
may 0 293 26
have 0 293 26
also 0 293 26
unlocked 0 293 26
a 0 293 26
new 0 293 26
era 0 293 26
of 0 293 26
digital 0 293 26
DIY 0 293 26
gunmaking 0 293 26
that 0 293 26
further 0 293 26
undermines 0 293 26
gun 0 293 26
control 0 293 26
across 0 293 26
the 0 293 26
United 0 293 26
States 0 293 26
and 0 293 26
the 0 293 26
world—another 0 293 26
step 0 293 26
toward 0 293 26
Wilson's 0 293 26
imagined 0 293 26
future 0 293 26
where 0 293 26
anyone 1 293 26
can 1 293 26
make 1 293 26
a 1 293 26
deadly 1 293 26
weapon 1 293 26
at 1 293 26

with 1 293 26
no 1 293 26

to 0 293 27

and 0 293 28
his 0 293 28

his 0 293 28

in 0 293 47

The 0 293 47

grown 0 293 47
to 0 293 47

What 0 293 48
does 0 293 48
all 0 293 48
this 0 293 48
mean? 0 293 48

Well, 0 293 49
it's 0 293 49
pretty 0 293 49
simple, 0 293 49
and 1 293 49
I 1 293 49
highly 1 293 49
recommend 1 293 49
the 1 293 49
Wired 1 293 49
article, 1 293 49
which 1 293 49
is 1 293 49
quite 1 293 49
lengthy 1 293 49
and 1 293 49
has 1 293 49
lots 1 293 49
of 1 293 49
information, 1 293 49
but 0 293 49
what 0 293 49
this 0 293 49
does 0 293 49
is 0 293 49
demonstrates 0 293 49
that 0 293 49
the 1 293 49
genie 1 293 49
is 1 293 49
out 1 293 49
of 1 293 49
the 1 293 49
bottle 1 293 49
and 0 293 49
there 0 293 49
is 0 293 49
just 0 293 49
no 0 293 49
way 0 293 49
for 0 293 49
gun 1 293 49
grabbing 1 293 49
Communists 1 293 49
the 0 293 49
world 0 293 49
over 0 293 49
to 0 293 49
be 0 293 49
able 0 293 49
to 0 293 49
truly 0 293 49
enforce 0 293 49
their 0 293 49
unlawful 0 293 49
acts 0 293 49
of 0 293 49
fun 1 293 49
gun 1 293 49
confiscation. 1 293 49

Why? 0 293 50

Because 0 293 51
now, 0 293 51
anyone 0 293 51
with 0 293 51
access 0 293 51
to 0 293 51
the 0 293 51
internet 0 293 51
and 0 293 51
a 0 293 51
3D 0 293 51
printer 0 293 51
can 0 293 51
print 0 293 51
their 0 293 51
very 0 293 51
own 0 293 51
gun 0 293 51
that 0 293 51
is 0 293 51
unregistered. 0 293 51

That's 0 293 52
right, 0 293 52
and 0 293 52
it's 0 293 52
perfectly 0 293 52
legal 0 293 52
to 0 293 52
do 0 293 52
so. 0 293 52

And 0 293 53
we 0 293 53
aren't 0 293 53
just 0 293 53
talking 0 293 53
a 0 293 53
rigid 0 293 53
looking 0 293 53
one-shot 0 293 53
handgun. 0 293 53

We're 0 293 54
talking 0 293 54
ARs, 0 293 54
1911s 0 293 54
and 0 293 54
a 0 293 54
host 0 293 54
of 0 293 54
other 0 293 54
guns. 0 293 54

This 0 293 55
actually 0 293 55
may 0 293 55
end 0 293 55
up 0 293 55
undermining 0 293 55
the 0 293 55

in 0 293 55

as 0 293 55

in 0 293 55
a 0 293 55
similar 0 293 55
manner 0 293 55
to 0 293 55
how 0 293 55
the 0 293 55

had 0 293 55
a 0 293 55

Wilson 0 293 56

that 0 293 56
his 1 293 56

officially 1 293 56
killed 1 293 56
gun 1 293 56
control. 1 293 56

"I 0 293 57
barely 1 293 57

into 1 293 57

I 1 293 57
got 1 293 57
you 1 293 57
the 1 293 57
Second 1 293 57
Amendment 1 293 57
forever," 1 293 57
he 0 293 57
told 0 293 57
The 0 293 57
Daily 0 293 57
Wire 0 293 57
in 0 293 57
a 0 293 57
phone 0 293 57
interview. 0 293 57

"What 1 293 58
has 1 293 58
the 1 293 58
NRA 1 293 58
done 1 293 58
for 1 293 58
you 1 293 58
lately?" 1 293 58

I 0 293 59
don't 0 293 59
know 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
I 0 293 59
would 0 293 59
go 0 293 59
quite 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
far, 0 293 59
after 0 293 59
all, 0 293 59
the 0 293 59
settlement 0 293 59
does 0 293 59
state 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
"the 0 293 59
government 0 293 59
expressly 0 293 59
acknowledges 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
non-automatic 0 293 59
firearms 0 293 59
up 0 293 59
to 0 293 59
.50-caliber 0 293 59
– 0 293 59
including 0 293 59
modern 0 293 59
semi-auto 0 293 59
sporting 0 293 59
rifles 0 293 59
such 0 293 59
as 0 293 59
the 0 293 59
popular 0 293 59
AR-15 0 293 59
and 0 293 59
similar 0 293 59
firearms 0 293 59
– 0 293 59
are 0 293 59
not 0 293 59
inherently 0 293 59
military." 0 293 59

Therefore, 0 293 60
the 0 293 60
government 0 293 60
still 0 293 60
believes 0 293 60
it 0 293 60
has 0 293 60
a 0 293 60
right 0 293 60
to 0 293 60
regulate 0 293 60
certain 0 293 60
arms, 0 293 60
which 0 293 60
it 0 293 60
does 0 293 60
not 0 293 60
have 0 293 60
authority 0 293 60
to 0 293 60
do. 0 293 60

"This 0 293 61
doesn’t 0 293 61
put 0 293 61
the 0 293 61
rifle 0 293 61
in 0 293 61
everyone’s 0 293 61
hand, 0 293 61
but 0 293 61
it 0 293 61
does 0 293 61
that 0 293 61
in 0 293 61
essence" 0 293 61
he 0 293 61
added. 0 293 61

"The 1 293 62
DNA 1 293 62
of 1 293 62
our 1 293 62
culture 1 293 62
is 1 293 62

This 1 293 63

tomorrow, 1 293 63
and 1 293 63
it 1 293 63
is 1 293 63
permanent." 1 293 63

This 1 293 64
is 1 293 64
a 1 293 64

Americans 1 294 42
are 1 294 42
so 1 294 42
unaware 1 294 42
that 1 294 42
they 1 294 42
have 1 294 42
no 1 294 42

For 0 294 43
example, 0 294 43
during 0 294 43
the 0 294 43
last 0 294 43
half 0 294 43
of 0 294 43
the 0 294 43
1970s 0 294 43

I 0 294 44
was 0 294 44
working 0 294 44
together 0 294 44
with 0 294 44
a 0 294 44

threatened 0 294 44

ability 0 294 44
to 0 294 44
meet 0 294 44
its 0 294 44
obligations. 0 294 44

Republican 0 294 45
Senators 0 294 45
Hatch, 0 294 45
Roth, 0 294 45
and 0 294 45
Hayakawa 0 294 45
were 0 294 45
trying 0 294 45
to 0 294 45
introduce 0 294 45
a 0 294 45
supply-side 0 294 45
economic 0 294 45
policy 0 294 45
as 0 294 45

the 0 294 45
stagflation 0 294 45
that 0 294 45
was 0 294 45
threatening 0 294 45
the 0 294 45
US 0 294 45
economy 0 294 45
with 0 294 45
failure. 0 294 45

The 0 294 46
Democrats, 0 294 46
who 0 294 46
later 0 294 46
in 0 294 46
the 0 294 46
Senate 0 294 46
led 0 294 46
the 0 294 46
way 0 294 46
to 0 294 46
a 0 294 46
supply-side 0 294 46
policy, 0 294 46
were, 0 294 46
at 0 294 46
this 0 294 46
time, 0 294 46
opposed 0 294 46
(see 0 294 46
Paul 0 294 46

Harvard 0 294 46
University 0 294 46
Press, 0 294 46
1984). 0 294 46

The 0 294 47
Democrats 0 294 47
claimed 0 294 47
that 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
policy 0 294 47
would 0 294 47
worsen 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
budget 0 294 47
deficit, 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
only 0 294 47
time 0 294 47
in 0 294 47
those 0 294 47
days 0 294 47
Democrats 0 294 47
cared 0 294 47
about 0 294 47
the 0 294 47
budget 0 294 47
deficit. 0 294 47

The 0 294 48
Democrats 0 294 48
said 0 294 48
that 0 294 48
they 0 294 48
would 0 294 48
support 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
tax 0 294 48
rate 0 294 48
reductions 0 294 48
if 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
Republicans 0 294 48
would 0 294 48
support 0 294 48
offsetting 0 294 48
cuts 0 294 48
in 0 294 48
the 0 294 48
budget 0 294 48
to 0 294 48
support 0 294 48
a 0 294 48
balanced 0 294 48
budget. 0 294 48

This 0 294 49
was 0 294 49
a 0 294 49
ploy 0 294 49
to 0 294 49
put 0 294 49
Republicans 0 294 49
on 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
spot 0 294 49
for 0 294 49
taking 0 294 49
away 0 294 49
some 0 294 49
groups’ 0 294 49
handouts 0 294 49
in 0 294 49
order 0 294 49
“to 0 294 49
cut 0 294 49
tax 0 294 49
rates 0 294 49
for 0 294 49
the 0 294 49
rich.” 0 294 49

The 0 294 50
supply-side 0 294 50
policy 0 294 50
did 0 294 50
not 0 294 50
require 0 294 50
budget 0 294 50
cuts, 0 294 50
but 0 294 50
in 0 294 50
order 0 294 50
to 0 294 50
demonstrate 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
Democrats 0 294 50
lack 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
sincerety, 0 294 50
Hayakawa’s 0 294 50
aid 0 294 50
and 0 294 50
I 0 294 50
had 0 294 50
our 0 294 50
senators 0 294 50
introduce 0 294 50
a 0 294 50
series 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
budget 0 294 50
cuts 0 294 50
together 0 294 50
with 0 294 50
tax 0 294 50
cuts 0 294 50
that, 0 294 50
on 0 294 50
a 0 294 50
static 0 294 50
revenue 0 294 50
basis 0 294 50
(not 0 294 50
counting 0 294 50
tax 0 294 50
revenue 0 294 50
feedbacks 0 294 50
from 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
incentives 0 294 50
of 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
lower 0 294 50
tax 0 294 50
rates) 0 294 50
kept 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
budget 0 294 50
even, 0 294 50
and 0 294 50
the 0 294 50
Democrats 0 294 50
voted 0 294 50
against 0 294 50
them 0 294 50
every 0 294 50
time. 0 294 50

When 0 294 51
the 0 294 51
combination 0 294 51
of 0 294 51
tax 0 294 51
cuts 0 294 51
with 0 294 51
defense 0 294 51
budget 0 294 51
cuts 0 294 51
came 0 294 51
up 0 294 51
for 0 294 51
a 0 294 51
vote, 0 294 51
the 1 294 51
legendary 1 294 51
senator 1 294 51
Strom 0 294 51
Thurmond, 0 294 51
a 0 294 51
48-year 0 294 51
member 0 294 51
of 0 294 51
the 0 294 51
US 0 294 51
Senate 0 294 51
from 0 294 51
South 0 294 51
Carolina, 0 294 51
tapped 0 294 51
me 0 294 51
on 0 294 51
the 0 294 51
shoulder. 0 294 51

He 0 294 52
said: 0 294 52
“son, 1 294 52
never 1 294 52
set 1 294 52
your 1 294 52
senator 1 294 52
up 1 294 52
against 1 294 52
the 1 294 52
military/security 1 294 52
complex. 1 294 52

He 1 294 53
will 1 294 53
not 1 294 53
be 1 294 53
re-elected, 1 294 53
and 1 294 53
you 1 294 53
will 1 294 53
be 1 294 53
out 1 294 53
of 1 294 53
a 1 294 53
job.” 1 294 53
I 0 294 53
replied 0 294 53
that 0 294 53
we 0 294 53
were 0 294 53
just 0 294 53
establishing 0 294 53
for 0 294 53
the 0 294 53
record 0 294 53
that 0 294 53
under 0 294 53
no 0 294 53
conditions 0 294 53
would 0 294 53
the 0 294 53
Democrats, 0 294 53
who 0 294 53
wanted 0 294 53
more 0 294 53
government, 0 294 53
vote 0 294 53
for 0 294 53
a 0 294 53
tax 0 294 53
rate 0 294 53
reduction 0 294 53
even 0 294 53
if 0 294 53
there 0 294 53
was 0 294 53
a 0 294 53
case 0 294 53
that 0 294 53
it 0 294 53
would 0 294 53
cure 0 294 53
stagflation. 0 294 53

He 0 294 54
replied: 0 294 54
“son, 0 294 54
the 1 294 54
military/security 1 294 54
complex 1 294 54
doesn’t 1 294 54
care.” 1 294 54

My 0 294 55
emergence 1 294 55
from 1 294 55
The 1 294 55
Matrix 1 294 55
began 0 294 55
with 0 294 55
Thurmond’s 0 294 55
pat 0 294 55
on 0 294 55
my 0 294 55
shoulder. 0 294 55

It 0 294 56
grew 0 294 56
with 0 294 56
my 0 294 56
time 0 294 56
at 0 294 56
the 0 294 56
Wall 0 294 56
Street 0 294 56
Journal 0 294 56
when 0 294 56
I 0 294 56
learned 0 294 56
that 0 294 56
some 0 294 56
truthful 0 294 56
things 0 294 56
simply 0 294 56
could 0 294 56
not 0 294 56
be 0 294 56
said. 0 294 56

In 0 294 57
the 0 294 57
Treasury 0 294 57
I 0 294 57
experienced 0 294 57
how 0 294 57
those 0 294 57
outside 0 294 57
interests 0 294 57
opposed 0 294 57
to 0 294 57
a 0 294 57
president’s 0 294 57
policy 0 294 57
marshall 1 294 57
their 1 294 57
forces 1 294 57
and 0 294 57
the 0 294 57
media 0 294 57
that 0 294 57
they 0 294 57
own 0 294 57
to 0 294 57
block 0 294 57
it. 0 294 57

Later 0 294 58
as 0 294 58
a 0 294 58
member 0 294 58
of 0 294 58
a 0 294 58
secret 0 294 58
presidential 0 294 58
committee, 0 294 58
I 0 294 58
saw 0 294 58
how 0 294 58
the 0 294 58
CIA 0 294 58
attempted 0 294 58
to 0 294 58
prevent 0 294 58
President 0 294 58
Reagan 0 294 58
from 0 294 58
ending 0 294 58
the 0 294 58
Cold 0 294 58
War. 0 294 58

Today, 1 294 59
right 1 294 59
now, 1 294 59
at 1 294 59
this 1 294 59
moment, 1 294 59
we 1 294 59
are 1 294 59
faced 1 294 59
with 1 294 59
a 1 294 59
massive 1 294 59
effort 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
military/security 1 294 59
complex, 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
neoconservatives, 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
Democratic 1 294 59
Party, 1 294 59
and 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
presstitute 1 294 59
media 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
discredit 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
elected 1 294 59
President 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
United 1 294 59
States 1 294 59
and 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
overthrow 1 294 59
him 1 294 59
in 1 294 59
order 1 294 59
that 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
utterly 1 294 59
corrupt 1 294 59
elite 1 294 59
that 1 294 59
rule 1 294 59
American 1 294 59
can 1 294 59
continue 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
hold 1 294 59
on 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
power 1 294 59
and 1 294 59
to 1 294 59
protect 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
massive 1 294 59
budget 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
military/security 1 294 59
complex 1 294 59
that, 1 294 59
along 1 294 59
with 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
Israel 1 294 59
Lobby, 1 294 59
funds 1 294 59
the 1 294 59
elections 1 294 59
of 1 294 59
those 1 294 59
who 1 294 59
rule 1 294 59
us. 1 294 59

Trump, 0 294 60
like 0 294 60
Reagan, 0 294 60
was 0 294 60
an 0 294 60
exception, 0 294 60
and 0 294 60
it 0 294 60
is 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
exceptions 0 294 60
that 0 294 60
accumulate 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
ire 0 294 60
of 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
corrupt 0 294 60
leftwing, 0 294 60
bought 0 294 60
off 0 294 60
with 0 294 60
money, 0 294 60
and 0 294 60
the 1 294 60
ire 1 294 60
of 1 294 60
the 1 294 60
media, 1 294 60
concentrated 0 294 60
into 0 294 60
small 0 294 60
tight 0 294 60
ownership 0 294 60
groups 0 294 60
indebted 0 294 60
to 0 294 60
those 0 294 60
who 0 294 60
permitted 0 294 60
the 0 294 60
illegal 0 294 60
concentration 0 294 60
of 0 294 60
a 0 294 60
once 0 294 60
independent 0 294 60
and 0 294 60
diverse 0 294 60
American 0 294 60
media 0 294 60
that 0 294 60
once 0 294 60
served, 0 294 60
on 0 294 60
occasion, 0 294 60
as 0 294 60
a 1 294 60
watchdog 1 294 60
over 1 294 60
government. 1 294 60

The 1 294 61
rightwing, 1 294 61
wrapped 1 294 61
in 1 294 61
the 1 294 61
flag, 1 294 61
dismisses 1 294 61
all 1 294 61
truth 1 294 61
as 1 294 61
“anti-American.” 1 294 61

If 0 294 62

If 0 294 82

listen 0 294 82
to 0 294 82
him, 0 294 82
Russia 0 294 82

the 1 294 82

of 1 294 82

Keep 1 294 83
in 1 294 83
mind 1 294 83
that 1 294 83
no 1 294 83

you 0 294 84

No 1 294 85

If 1 294 86
you 1 294 86

you 1 294 86
are 1 294 86
brainwashed 1 294 86
beyond 1 294 86
all 1 294 86
hope. 1 294 86

Not 1 294 87
even 1 294 87
I 1 294 87
can 1 294 87
rescue 1 294 87
you. 1 294 87

Nor 1 294 88
God 1 294 88
himself. 1 294 88

Americans, 0 294 89
and 0 294 89
indeed 0 294 89
the 0 294 89
Russians 0 294 89
themselves, 0 294 89
are 0 294 89
incapable 0 294 89
of 0 294 89
realizing 0 294 89
it, 0 294 89
but 0 294 89
there 0 294 89
is 0 294 89
a 0 294 89
chance 0 294 89
that 0 294 89
Trump 0 294 89

be 0 294 89
overthrown 0 294 89
and 0 294 89
a 0 294 89
Western 0 294 89
assault 0 294 89
will 0 294 89
be 0 294 89
launched 0 294 89
against 0 294 89
the 0 294 89
handful 0 294 89
of 0 294 89
countries 0 294 89
that 0 294 89
insist 0 294 89
on 0 294 89
sovereignty. 0 294 89

I 1 294 90
doubt 1 294 90
that 1 294 90
few 1 294 90
of 1 294 90
the 1 294 90
Americans 1 294 90
who 1 294 90
elected 1 294 90
Trump 1 294 90
will 1 294 90
be 1 294 90
taken 1 294 90
in 1 294 90
by 1 294 90
the 1 294 90
anti-Trump 1 294 90
propagana, 1 294 90
but 0 294 90
they 0 294 90
are 0 294 90
not 0 294 90
organized 0 294 90
and 0 294 90
have 0 294 90
no 0 294 90
armed 0 294 90
power. 0 294 90

The 0 294 91
police, 0 294 91
militarized 0 294 91

George 0 294 91
W. 0 294 91
Bush 0 294 91

Obama, 0 294 91
will 0 294 91
be 0 294 91
set 0 294 91
against 0 294 91
them. 0 294 91

The 0 294 92

will 0 294 92
be 0 294 92
local 0 294 92

In 0 77 6
this 0 77 6

the 0 77 6

even 0 77 6
going 0 77 6
so 0 77 6
far 0 77 6
as 0 77 6
to 0 77 6
suggest 0 77 6
this 1 77 6
protestant 1 77 6
ought 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
have 1 77 6
stayed 1 77 6
home 1 77 6
to 1 77 6
read 1 77 6
their 1 77 6

He 0 77 7

then 0 77 35
quotes 0 77 35
Romans 0 77 35
13: 0 77 35
1-7 0 77 35

Let 0 77 36
every 0 77 36
soul 0 77 36
be 0 77 36
subject 0 77 36
unto 0 77 36
the 0 77 36
higher 0 77 36
powers. 0 77 36

For 0 77 37
there 0 77 37
is 0 77 37
no 0 77 37
power 0 77 37
but 0 77 37
of 0 77 37
God: 0 77 37
the 0 77 37
powers 0 77 37
that 0 77 37
be 0 77 37
are 0 77 37
ordained 0 77 37
of 0 77 37
God. 0 77 37

Whosoever 1 77 38
therefore 1 77 38
resisteth 1 77 38
the 1 77 38
power, 1 77 38
resisteth 1 77 38
the 1 77 38
ordinance 1 77 38
of 1 77 38
God: 1 77 38
and 1 77 38
they 1 77 38
that 1 77 38
resist 1 77 38
shall 1 77 38
receive 1 77 38
to 1 77 38
themselves 1 77 38
damnation. 1 77 38

For 0 77 39
rulers 0 77 39
are 0 77 39
not 0 77 39
a 0 77 39
terror 0 77 39
to 0 77 39
good 0 77 39
works, 0 77 39
but 0 77 39
to 0 77 39
the 0 77 39
evil. 0 77 39

Wilt 0 77 40
thou 0 77 40
then 0 77 40
not 0 77 40
be 0 77 40
afraid 0 77 40
of 0 77 40
the 0 77 40
power? 0 77 40

do 0 77 41
that 0 77 41
which 0 77 41
is 0 77 41
good, 0 77 41
and 0 77 41
thou 0 77 41
shalt 0 77 41
have 0 77 41
praise 0 77 41
of 0 77 41
the 0 77 41
same: 0 77 41

For 0 77 42
he 0 77 42
is 0 77 42
the 0 77 42
minister 0 77 42
of 0 77 42
God 0 77 42
to 0 77 42
thee 0 77 42
for 0 77 42
good. 0 77 42

But 0 77 43
if 0 77 43
thou 0 77 43
do 0 77 43
that 0 77 43
which 0 77 43
is 0 77 43
evil, 0 77 43
be 0 77 43
afraid; 0 77 43
for 0 77 43
he 0 77 43
beareth 0 77 43
not 0 77 43
the 0 77 43
sword 0 77 43
in 0 77 43
vain: 0 77 43
for 0 77 43
he 0 77 43
is 0 77 43
the 1 77 43
minister 1 77 43
of 1 77 43
God, 1 77 43
a 1 77 43
revenger 1 77 43
to 1 77 43
execute 1 77 43
wrath 1 77 43
upon 1 77 43
him 1 77 43
that 1 77 43
doeth 1 77 43
evil. 1 77 43

Wherefore 0 77 44
ye 0 77 44
must 0 77 44
needs 0 77 44
be 0 77 44
subject, 0 77 44
not 0 77 44
only 0 77 44
for 0 77 44
wrath, 0 77 44
but 0 77 44
also 0 77 44
for 0 77 44
conscience 0 77 44
sake. 0 77 44

For 0 77 45
for 0 77 45
this 0 77 45
cause 0 77 45
pay 0 77 45
ye 0 77 45
tribute 0 77 45
also: 0 77 45
for 0 77 45
they 0 77 45
are 0 77 45
God's 0 77 45
ministers, 0 77 45
attending 0 77 45
continually 0 77 45
upon 0 77 45
this 0 77 45
very 0 77 45
thing. 0 77 45

Render 0 77 46
therefore 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
all 0 77 46
their 0 77 46
dues: 0 77 46
tribute 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
tribute 0 77 46
is 0 77 46
due; 0 77 46
custom 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
custom; 0 77 46
fear 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
fear; 0 77 46
honour 0 77 46
to 0 77 46
whom 0 77 46
honour. 0 77 46

The 0 77 47
first 0 77 47
Scripture 0 77 47
says: 0 77 47

Let 0 77 48
every 0 77 48
soul 0 77 48
be 0 77 48
subject 0 77 48
unto 0 77 48
the 0 77 48
higher 0 77 48
powers. 0 77 48

For 0 77 49
there 0 77 49
is 0 77 49
no 0 77 49
power 0 77 49
but 0 77 49
of 0 77 49
God: 0 77 49
the 0 77 49
powers 0 77 49
that 0 77 49
be 0 77 49
are 0 77 49
ordained 0 77 49
of 0 77 49
God. 0 77 49

God 0 77 50
ordained 0 77 50
the 0 77 50
power, 0 77 50
and 0 77 50
that 0 77 50
“rulers 0 77 50
are 0 77 50
not 0 77 50
a 0 77 50
terror 0 77 50
to 0 77 50
good 0 77 50
works, 0 77 50
but 0 77 50
to 0 77 50
the 0 77 50
evil." 0 77 50

Did 0 77 51
God 0 77 51
tell 0 77 51
His 0 77 51
Church 0 77 51
to 0 77 51
submit 0 77 51
to 0 77 51
that 0 77 51
which 0 77 51
He 0 77 51
condemns? 0 77 51

(Deuteronomy 0 77 52
25:1; 0 77 52
Proverbs 0 77 52
17:15) 0 77 52
Absolutely 1 77 52
not! 1 77 52

Is 0 77 53
the 0 77 53
Church 0 77 53
to 0 77 53
transgress 0 77 53
His 0 77 53
Laws, 0 77 53
or 0 77 53
to 0 77 53
magnify 0 77 53
and 0 77 53
enforce 0 77 53
His 0 77 53
Laws 0 77 53
unto 0 77 53
judgment? 0 77 53

(Psalm 0 77 54
40:8; 0 77 54
Romans 0 77 54
3:31) 0 77 54
Of 1 77 54
course 1 77 54
not! 1 77 54

If 0 77 55
He 0 77 55
did, 0 77 55
that 0 77 55
would 0 77 55
make 0 77 55
God 0 77 55
unjust. 0 77 55

Jesus 0 77 56
said, 0 77 56
"Think 0 77 56
not 0 77 56
that 0 77 56
I 0 77 56
am 0 77 56
come 0 77 56
to 0 77 56
destroy 0 77 56
the 0 77 56
law, 0 77 56
or 0 77 56
the 0 77 56
prophets: 0 77 56
I 0 77 56
am 0 77 56
not 0 77 56
come 0 77 56
to 0 77 56
destroy, 0 77 56
but 0 77 56
to 0 77 56
fulfil” 0 77 56
(Matthew 0 77 56
5:17). 0 77 56

The 0 77 57
Lord 0 77 57
has, 0 77 57
in 0 77 57
fact, 0 77 57
commanded 0 77 57
nowhere 0 77 57
in 0 77 57
Scripture 0 77 57
for 0 77 57
the 0 77 57
Church 0 77 57
to 0 77 57
submit 0 77 57
to 0 77 57
the 0 77 57
wicked. 0 77 57

The 0 77 58
Bible 0 77 58
teaches 0 77 58
just 0 77 58
the 0 77 58
exact 0 77 58
opposite. 0 77 58

We 0 77 59
are 0 77 59
to 0 77 59
“have 0 77 59
no 0 77 59
fellowship 0 77 59
with 0 77 59
the 0 77 59
unfruitful 1 77 59
works 1 77 59
of 1 77 59
darkness, 1 77 59
but 0 77 59
rather 0 77 59
reprove 0 77 59
(expose) 0 77 59
them” 0 77 59
(Ephesians 0 77 59
5:11). 0 77 59

Furthermore, 0 77 60
it 0 77 60
would 0 77 60
contradict 0 77 60
what 0 77 60
Scripture 0 77 60
teaches 0 77 60
us 0 77 60
from 0 77 60
Genesis 0 77 60
all 0 77 60
the 0 77 60
way 0 77 60
to 0 77 60
Revelation 0 77 60
every 0 77 60
step 0 77 60
of 0 77 60
the 0 77 60
way. 0 77 60

Think 0 77 61
of 0 77 61
this: 0 77 61
Those 0 77 61
that 0 77 61
serve 0 77 61
“We 1 77 61
the 1 77 61
People,” 1 77 61
before 0 77 61
taking 0 77 61
office, 0 77 61
swear 0 77 61
to 0 77 61
uphold 0 77 61
the 0 77 61
US 0 77 61

their 0 77 61
hand 0 77 61
on 0 77 61
the 0 77 61
Holy 0 77 61
Bible. 0 77 61

They 0 77 62
are 0 77 62
appointed 0 77 62
to 0 77 62
magnify 0 77 62
law 0 77 62
against 0 77 62
crime, 0 77 62
not 0 77 62
crime 0 77 62
against 0 77 62
the 0 77 62
law 0 77 62
(Psalm 0 77 62
94:20). 0 77 62

America 0 77 63
is 0 77 63

on 0 77 63
Common 0 77 63

“No 1 77 65

not 0 77 66
tear 0 77 66
it 0 77 66
down; 0 77 66
and 0 77 66
yet, 0 77 66
this 0 77 66
is 0 77 66
what 0 77 66
the 1 77 66
biblically 1 77 66
illiterate 1 77 66
are 0 77 66
teaching 0 77 66

do, 0 77 66
submit 0 77 66
to 0 77 66
the 1 77 66

and 0 77 66
His 0 77 66

(Micah 0 77 66

I 1 77 67
ask, 1 77 67
are 1 77 67
Christians 1 77 67
to 1 77 67
submit 1 77 67
to 1 77 67
those 1 77 67
who 1 77 67
have 1 77 67
sanctioned 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
murder 1 77 67
of 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
innocent 1 77 67
in 1 77 67
the 1 77 67
womb 1 77 67
(Exodus 0 77 67
20:13; 0 77 67
Proverbs 0 77 67
6:17)? 0 77 67

Absolutely 1 77 68
not! 1 77 68

Are 1 77 69
Christians 1 77 69
to 1 77 69
submit 1 77 69
to 1 77 69
those 1 77 69
who 1 77 69
have 1 77 69
redefined 1 77 69
marriage 1 77 69
where 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
man 1 77 69
can 1 77 69
now 1 77 69
"marry" 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
man 1 77 69
and 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
woman 1 77 69
can 1 77 69
now 1 77 69
"marry" 1 77 69
a 1 77 69
woman 1 77 69
(Leviticus 0 77 69

Romans 0 77 69

etc…)? 0 77 69

Absolutely 1 77 70
not! 1 77 70

Submit 1 77 71
to 1 77 71
those 1 77 71
who 1 77 71
lie 1 77 71
continuously, 1 77 71
to 1 77 71
them 1 77 71
that 1 77 71
steal 1 77 71
and 1 77 71
even 1 77 71
kill? 1 77 71

Absolutely 1 77 72
not! 1 77 72

Submit 0 77 73
to 0 77 73
what 0 77 73
God 0 77 73
condemns? 0 77 73

Yet, 0 77 74
this 0 77 74
is 0 77 74
what 0 77 74
the 1 77 74
perverse, 1 77 74
modern-day, 1 77 74
professing 1 77 74
Christians 1 77 74
are 0 77 74
teaching 0 77 74
the 1 77 74
sheep 1 77 74
in 0 77 74
the 0 77 74
American 0 77 74
Church 0 77 74
today. 0 77 74

It 0 77 75
would 0 77 75
do 0 77 75
you 0 77 75
well 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
now 0 77 75
look 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
Christ 0 77 75
when 0 77 75
He 0 77 75
said 0 77 75
that 0 77 75
we 0 77 75
are 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
beware 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
leaven 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
Pharisee’s 0 77 75
(corrupt 0 77 75
doctrines 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
those 0 77 75
who 0 77 75
claimed 0 77 75
to 0 77 75
be 0 77 75
the 1 77 75
children 1 77 75
of 1 77 75
God), 1 77 75
as 0 77 75
well 0 77 75
as 0 77 75
the 0 77 75
leaven 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
Herod 0 77 75
(corrupt 0 77 75
doctrines 0 77 75
of 0 77 75
government) 0 77 75
(Mark 0 77 75
8:15). 0 77 75

If 0 77 76
you 0 77 76
remember, 0 77 76
it 0 77 76
was 0 77 76
those 0 77 76
same 0 77 76
people 0 77 76
who 0 77 76
called 0 77 76
for 0 77 76
the 0 77 76
crucifixion 0 77 76
of 0 77 76
Christ 0 77 76
while 0 77 76
crying 1 77 76
out 1 77 76
“We 0 77 76
have 0 77 76
no 0 77 76
King 0 77 76
but 0 77 76
Caesar” 0 77 76
(John 0 77 76
19:15). 0 77 76

Do 0 77 77
these 0 77 77
that 0 77 77
teach 1 77 77
such 1 77 77
heresy 1 77 77
not 0 77 77
realize 0 77 77
that 0 77 77
every 0 77 77
apostle, 0 77 77
except 0 77 77
John, 0 77 77
was 0 77 77

by 0 77 77
hostile 1 77 77
corrupt 1 77 77
civil 1 77 77
authorities 1 77 77
opposed 0 77 77
to 0 77 77
their 0 77 77
endeavors? 0 77 77

Christians 0 77 78
throughout 0 77 78
history 0 77 78
were 0 77 78
imprisoned, 0 77 78

killed 0 77 78
by 0 77 78
corrupt 1 77 78
civil 1 77 78
authorities 1 77 78
of 1 77 78
all 1 77 78
stripes 1 77 78
for 0 77 78
refusing 0 77 78

to 0 77 78
their 0 77 78
various, 0 77 78

Did 0 77 79

violate 0 77 79
God’s 0 77 79

Of 1 77 80
course, 1 77 80
not. 1 77 80

Also, 0 77 81
keep 0 77 81
in 0 77 81
mind 0 77 81
that 0 77 81
magistrates 0 77 81
have 0 77 81

defined 0 77 81

Take 0 77 82
note 0 77 82
that 0 77 82
civil 0 77 82
government 0 77 82
is 0 77 82
to 0 77 82
be, 0 77 82

must 0 77 82
be, 0 77 82
a 1 77 82
“terror 1 77 82
to 1 77 82
good 1 77 82
works.” 1 77 82
It 0 77 82
has 0 77 82
no 0 77 82
power 0 77 82

authority 0 77 82
to 0 77 82
terrorize 0 77 82
good 0 77 82
works 0 77 82
or 0 77 82
good, 1 77 82
law-abiding 1 77 82
people. 1 77 82

God 0 77 83
never 0 77 83

any, 0 77 83

its 0 77 83

has 0 77 83
no 0 77 83

or 0 77 83
protection. 0 77 83

Civil 0 77 84
government 0 77 84
is 0 77 84
a 0 77 84
“minister 0 77 84

(Romans 0 77 84

It 0 77 85
is 0 77 85
not 0 77 85
a 0 77 85

God 0 77 85

Civil 0 77 86

“execute 1 77 86

Anyone 1 77 86

"him 1 77 86

uneducated 1 77 86
in 1 77 86

to 0 77 87
evil 1 77 87
civil 1 77 87

I 0 77 89
ask, 0 77 89
did 0 77 89
Moses 0 77 89
violate 0 77 89
God's 0 77 89
principle 0 77 89
of 0 77 89
submission 0 77 89
when 0 77 89
he 0 77 89
was 0 77 89
commanded 0 77 89
by 0 77 89
God, 0 77 89
“Go 0 77 89
in 0 77 89
unto 0 77 89
Pharaoh, 0 77 89

him, 0 77 89
Thus 0 77 89
saith 0 77 89
the 1 77 89
LORD 1 77 89
God 1 77 89
of 1 77 89

serve 0 77 89
me” 0 77 89
(Exodus 0 77 89
9:1). 0 77 89

And 0 77 90
when 0 77 90
Pharaoh 0 77 90
refused, 0 77 90
God 0 77 90
plagued 0 77 90

His 0 77 90

Think 0 77 91
of 0 77 91
this, 0 77 91
the 1 77 91
meekest 1 77 91
man 1 77 91

Is 0 77 92
this 0 77 92
what 0 77 92
is 0 77 92
being 0 77 92
preached 0 77 92
from 0 77 92

Or 0 77 93
what 0 77 93
of 0 77 93
Gideon 0 77 93

The 0 77 94

the 0 77 94
Lord 0 77 94

his 0 77 94
father's 0 77 94

(Judges 0 77 94

Was 0 77 95
this 0 77 95
a 0 77 95
violation 0 77 95
of 0 77 95
God's 0 77 95
principles 0 77 95
of 0 77 95

The 0 77 96
sins 0 77 96
of 0 77 96
the 0 77 96
fathers 0 77 96
were 0 77 96
the 0 77 96

them. 0 77 96

What 0 77 97
of 0 77 97

The 1 77 98

called 0 77 98
him 0 77 98
the 1 77 98
troubler 1 77 98
of 1 77 98
Israel. 1 77 98

Elijah 0 77 99
set 0 77 99
the 0 77 99
record 0 77 99
straight 0 77 99
when 0 77 99
he 0 77 99
answered, 0 77 99
"I 0 77 99

God's 0 77 114

Keep 0 77 115
in 0 77 115
mind 0 77 115
that 0 77 115
the 0 77 115

No, 0 77 126
it 0 77 126

with 0 77 129

the 0 77 129
opposite. 0 77 129

“Being 0 77 130
grieved 0 77 130
that 0 77 130
they 0 77 130
taught 0 77 130
the 0 77 130
people, 0 77 130
and 0 77 130
preached 0 77 130

the 0 77 130
resurrection 0 77 130
from 0 77 130

And 0 77 131
they 0 77 131
laid 0 77 131
hands 0 77 131
on 0 77 131
them, 0 77 131

it 0 77 131

now 0 77 131
eventide. 0 77 131

Howbeit 0 77 132
many 0 77 132
of 0 77 132
them 0 77 132
which 0 77 132
heard 0 77 132
the 0 77 132

the 0 77 132
number 0 77 132
of 0 77 132
the 0 77 132
men 0 77 132

about 0 77 132
five 0 77 132

it 0 77 133
came 0 77 133
to 0 77 133

Jerusalem. 0 77 133

And 0 77 134
when 0 77 134
they 0 77 134
had 0 77 134
set 0 77 134
them 0 77 134
in 0 77 134
the 0 77 134

they 0 77 134
asked, 0 77 134
By 0 77 134
what 0 77 134
power, 0 77 134
or 0 77 134
by 0 77 134

have 0 77 134
ye 0 77 134

this? 0 77 134

Then 0 77 135
Peter, 0 77 135
filled 0 77 135
with 0 77 135
the 0 77 135
Holy 0 77 135
Ghost, 0 77 135
said 0 77 135
unto 0 77 135
them, 0 77 135
Ye 0 77 135
rulers 0 77 135
of 0 77 135
the 0 77 135
people, 0 77 135
and 0 77 135
elders 0 77 135
of 0 77 135
Israel, 0 77 135

If 0 77 136
we 0 77 136
this 0 77 136
day 0 77 136

examined 0 77 136

by 0 77 136
what 0 77 136
means 0 77 136
he 0 77 136
is 0 77 136
made 0 77 136
whole; 0 77 136

Be 0 77 137
it 0 77 137
known 0 77 137
unto 0 77 137
you 0 77 137
all, 0 77 137
and 0 77 137
to 0 77 137
all 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
people 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Israel, 0 77 137
that 0 77 137
by 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
name 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Jesus 0 77 137
Christ 0 77 137
of 0 77 137
Nazareth, 0 77 137
whom 0 77 137
ye 0 77 137
crucified, 0 77 137
whom 0 77 137
God 0 77 137
raised 0 77 137
from 0 77 137
the 0 77 137
dead, 0 77 137
even 0 77 137
by 0 77 137
him 0 77 137
doth 0 77 137
this 0 77 137
man 0 77 137
stand 0 77 137
here 0 77 137
before 0 77 137
you 0 77 137
whole. 0 77 137

This 0 77 138
is 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
stone 0 77 138
which 0 77 138
was 0 77 138
set 0 77 138
at 0 77 138
nought 0 77 138
of 0 77 138
you 0 77 138
builders, 0 77 138
which 0 77 138
is 0 77 138
become 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
head 0 77 138
of 0 77 138
the 0 77 138
corner. 0 77 138

Neither 0 77 139
is 0 77 139
there 0 77 139
salvation 0 77 139
in 0 77 139
any 0 77 139
other: 0 77 139
for 0 77 139
there 0 77 139
is 0 77 139
none 0 77 139
other 0 77 139
name 0 77 139
under 0 77 139
heaven 0 77 139
given 0 77 139
among 0 77 139
men, 0 77 139
whereby 0 77 139
we 0 77 139
must 0 77 139
be 0 77 139
saved. 0 77 139

Now 0 77 140
when 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
saw 0 77 140
the 0 77 140
boldness 0 77 140
of 0 77 140
Peter 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
John, 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
perceived 0 77 140
that 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
were 0 77 140
unlearned 1 77 140
and 1 77 140
ignorant 1 77 140
men, 1 77 140
they 0 77 140
marvelled; 0 77 140
and 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
took 0 77 140
knowledge 0 77 140
of 0 77 140
them, 0 77 140
that 0 77 140
they 0 77 140
had 0 77 140
been 0 77 140
with 0 77 140
Jesus. 0 77 140

And 0 77 141
beholding 0 77 141
the 0 77 141
man 0 77 141
which 0 77 141
was 0 77 141
healed 0 77 141
standing 0 77 141
with 0 77 141
them, 0 77 141
they 0 77 141
could 0 77 141
say 0 77 141
nothing 0 77 141
against 0 77 141
it. 0 77 141

But 0 77 142
when 0 77 142
they 0 77 142
had 0 77 142
commanded 0 77 142
them 0 77 142
to 0 77 142
go 0 77 142
aside 0 77 142
out 0 77 142
of 0 77 142
the 0 77 142
council, 0 77 142
they 0 77 142
conferred 0 77 142
among 0 77 142
themselves, 0 77 142

Saying, 0 77 143
What 0 77 143
shall 0 77 143
we 0 77 143
do 0 77 143
to 0 77 143
these 0 77 143
men? 0 77 143

for 0 77 144
that 0 77 144
indeed 0 77 144
a 0 77 144
notable 0 77 144
miracle 0 77 144
hath 0 77 144
been 0 77 144
done 0 77 144
by 0 77 144
them 0 77 144
is 0 77 144
manifest 0 77 144
to 0 77 144
all 0 77 144
them 0 77 144
that 0 77 144
dwell 0 77 144
in 0 77 144
Jerusalem; 0 77 144
and 0 77 144
we 0 77 144
cannot 0 77 144
deny 0 77 144
it. 0 77 144

But 0 77 145
that 0 77 145
it 0 77 145
spread 0 77 145
no 0 77 145
further 0 77 145
among 0 77 145
the 0 77 145
people, 0 77 145
let 0 77 145
us 0 77 145
straitly 0 77 145
threaten 0 77 145
them, 0 77 145
that 0 77 145
they 0 77 145
speak 0 77 145
henceforth 0 77 145
to 0 77 145
no 0 77 145
man 0 77 145
in 0 77 145
this 0 77 145
name. 0 77 145

And 0 77 146
they 0 77 146
called 0 77 146
them, 0 77 146
and 0 77 146
commanded 0 77 146
them 0 77 146
not 0 77 146
to 0 77 146
speak 0 77 146
at 0 77 146
all 0 77 146
nor 0 77 146
teach 0 77 146
in 0 77 146
the 0 77 146
name 0 77 146
of 0 77 146

Peter 0 77 147

unto 0 77 147
them, 0 77 147
Whether 0 77 147
it 0 77 147
be 0 77 147
right 0 77 147
in 0 77 147

For 0 77 148
we 0 77 148
cannot 0 77 148
but 0 77 148
speak 0 77 148
the 0 77 148
things 0 77 148
which 0 77 148
we 0 77 148
have 0 77 148
seen 0 77 148
and 0 77 148
heard.” 0 77 148
Acts 0 77 148
4:2-20 0 77 148

Or 0 77 149
what 0 77 149
of 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
account 0 77 149
found 0 77 149
in 0 77 149
Acts 0 77 149
12:1-11, 0 77 149
where 0 77 149
the 0 77 149
Lord 0 77 149
sent 0 77 149
an 0 77 149
Angel 0 77 149
to 0 77 149
liberate 0 77 149
Peter 0 77 149
from 0 77 149
the 0 77 149

of 0 77 149

“Now 0 77 150
about 0 77 150
that 0 77 150
time 0 77 150
Herod 0 77 150
the 0 77 150
king 0 77 150
stretched 0 77 150
forth 0 77 150
his 0 77 150
hands 0 77 150
to 0 77 150
vex 0 77 150
certain 0 77 150
of 0 77 150
the 0 77 150
church. 0 77 150

And 0 77 151
he 0 77 151
killed 0 77 151
James 0 77 151
the 0 77 151
brother 0 77 151
of 0 77 151
John 0 77 151
with 0 77 151
the 0 77 151
sword. 0 77 151

And 0 77 152
because 0 77 152
he 0 77 152
saw 0 77 152
it 0 77 152
pleased 0 77 152
the 0 77 152
Jews, 0 77 152
he 0 77 152
proceeded 0 77 152
further 0 77 152
to 0 77 152
take 0 77 152
Peter 0 77 152
also. 0 77 152

(Then 0 77 153
were 0 77 153
the 0 77 153
days 0 77 153
of 0 77 153
unleavened 0 77 153
bread.) 0 77 153

And 0 77 154
when 0 77 154
he 0 77 154
had 0 77 154
apprehended 0 77 154
him, 0 77 154
he 0 77 154
put 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
in 0 77 154
prison, 0 77 154
and 0 77 154
delivered 0 77 154
him 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
four 0 77 154
quaternions 0 77 154
of 0 77 154
soldiers 0 77 154
to 0 77 154

intending 0 77 154
after 0 77 154
Easter 0 77 154
to 0 77 154
bring 0 77 154

the 0 77 154

Peter 0 77 155
therefore 0 77 155
was 0 77 155
kept 0 77 155
in 0 77 155
prison: 0 77 155
but 0 77 155
prayer 0 77 155
was 0 77 155
made 0 77 155
without 0 77 155
ceasing 0 77 155
of 0 77 155
the 0 77 155
church 0 77 155
unto 0 77 155
God 0 77 155
for 0 77 155
him. 0 77 155

And 0 77 156
when 0 77 156
Herod 0 77 156
would 0 77 156
have 0 77 156
brought 0 77 156
him 0 77 156
forth, 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
same 0 77 156
night 0 77 156
Peter 0 77 156
was 0 77 156
sleeping 0 77 156
between 0 77 156
two 0 77 156
soldiers, 0 77 156
bound 0 77 156
with 0 77 156
two 0 77 156
chains: 0 77 156
and 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
keepers 0 77 156
before 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
door 0 77 156
kept 0 77 156
the 0 77 156
prison. 0 77 156

And, 0 77 157
behold, 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
angel 0 77 157
of 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
Lord 0 77 157
came 0 77 157
upon 0 77 157
him, 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
a 0 77 157
light 0 77 157
shined 0 77 157
in 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
prison: 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
he 0 77 157
smote 0 77 157
Peter 0 77 157
on 0 77 157
the 0 77 157
side, 0 77 157
and 0 77 157
raised 0 77 157
him 0 77 157
up, 0 77 157
saying, 0 77 157
Arise 0 77 157
up 0 77 157
quickly. 0 77 157

And 0 77 158
his 0 77 158
chains 0 77 158
fell 0 77 158
off 0 77 158
from 0 77 158
his 0 77 158
hands. 0 77 158

And 0 77 159
the 0 77 159
angel 0 77 159
said 0 77 159
unto 0 77 159
him, 0 77 159
Gird 0 77 159
thyself, 0 77 159
and 0 77 159
bind 0 77 159
on 0 77 159
thy 0 77 159
sandals. 0 77 159

And 0 77 160
so 0 77 160
he 0 77 160
did. 0 77 160

And 0 77 161
he 0 77 161
saith 0 77 161
unto 0 77 161
him, 0 77 161
Cast 0 77 161
thy 0 77 161
garment 0 77 161
about 0 77 161
thee, 0 77 161
and 0 77 161
follow 0 77 161
me. 0 77 161

And 0 77 162
he 0 77 162
went 0 77 162
out, 0 77 162
and 0 77 162
followed 0 77 162
him; 0 77 162
and 0 77 162
wist 0 77 162
not 0 77 162
that 0 77 162
it 0 77 162
was 0 77 162
true 0 77 162
which 0 77 162
was 0 77 162
done 0 77 162
by 0 77 162
the 0 77 162
angel; 0 77 162
but 0 77 162
thought 0 77 162
he 0 77 162
saw 0 77 162
a 0 77 162
vision. 0 77 162

When 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
were 0 77 163
past 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
first 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
second 0 77 163
ward, 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
came 0 77 163
unto 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
iron 0 77 163
gate 0 77 163
that 0 77 163
leadeth 0 77 163
unto 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
city; 0 77 163
which 0 77 163
opened 0 77 163
to 0 77 163
them 0 77 163
of 0 77 163
his 0 77 163
own 0 77 163
accord: 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
they 0 77 163
went 0 77 163
out, 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
passed 0 77 163
on 0 77 163
through 0 77 163
one 0 77 163
street; 0 77 163
and 0 77 163
forthwith 0 77 163
the 0 77 163
angel 0 77 163
departed 0 77 163
from 0 77 163
him. 0 77 163

And 0 77 164
when 0 77 164
Peter 0 77 164
was 0 77 164
come 0 77 164
to 0 77 164
himself, 0 77 164
he 0 77 164
said, 0 77 164
Now 0 77 164
I 0 77 164
know 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
a 0 77 164
surety, 0 77 164
that 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
Lord 0 77 164
hath 0 77 164
sent 0 77 164
his 0 77 164
angel, 0 77 164
and 0 77 164
hath 0 77 164
delivered 0 77 164
me 0 77 164
out 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
hand 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
Herod, 0 77 164
and 0 77 164
from 0 77 164
all 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
expectation 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
people 0 77 164
of 0 77 164
the 0 77 164
Jews.” 0 77 164

Over 0 77 165
and 0 77 165
over 0 77 165
again, 0 77 165
you 0 77 165
can 0 77 165
see 0 77 165
that 0 77 165
the 0 77 165
Church 0 77 165
was 0 77 165
to 0 77 165
stand 0 77 165
in 0 77 165
protest 0 77 165
against 0 77 165
the 1 77 165
wicked 1 77 165
that 1 77 165
were 1 77 165
at 1 77 165
war 1 77 165
with 1 77 165
Christ 1 77 165
(Revelation 0 77 165
12:17), 0 77 165
in 0 77 165
dealing 0 77 165
with 0 77 165
not 0 77 165
only 0 77 165
the 1 77 165
corrupt 1 77 165
and 1 77 165
wicked 1 77 165
priests, 1 77 165
but 0 77 165
also 0 77 165
the 1 77 165
corrupt 1 77 165
and 1 77 165
wicked 1 77 165
in 1 77 165
government. 1 77 165

as 0 77 166
well 0 77 166
as 0 77 166
those 0 77 166
who 0 77 166
submitted 0 77 166
to 0 77 166
such. 0 77 166

It 0 77 167
is 0 77 167
important 0 77 167
for 0 77 167
people 0 77 167
to 0 77 167
know 0 77 167
the 0 77 167
Scriptures 0 77 167
(History), 0 77 167
lest 0 77 167
you 0 77 167
find 0 77 167
yourselves 0 77 167
to 0 77 167
be 0 77 167
fighting 0 77 167
against 0 77 167
God 0 77 167
(Acts 0 77 167
5:39). 0 77 167

Nowhere 0 77 168
in 0 77 168
Scripture 0 77 168
can 0 77 168
you 0 77 168
find 0 77 168
the 0 77 168
Lord 0 77 168
telling 0 77 168
His 0 77 168
children 0 77 168
to 0 77 168
submit 0 77 168
to 0 77 168
the 0 77 168
wicked 0 77 168
in 0 77 168
disobedience 0 77 168
to 0 77 168
His 0 77 168
Word. 0 77 168

Nowhere! 1 77 169

and 0 298 5
applaud 0 298 5
the 0 298 5
great 0 298 5
work 0 298 5
they 0 298 5
do 0 298 5
everyday 0 298 5
for 0 298 5
Christ 0 298 5
and 0 298 5

The 0 298 6
replies 0 298 6
haven’t 0 298 6
topped 0 298 6
out 0 298 6
yet, 0 298 6
at 0 298 6
121, 0 298 6
nearly 0 298 6
all 0 298 6
of 0 298 6
them 0 298 6
expressing 0 298 6
outrage 1 298 6
at 0 298 6
this 0 298 6
cavalier 0 298 6
attitude 0 298 6
toward 0 298 6
the 0 298 6
revelation 0 298 6
that 0 298 6
Cardinal 0 298 6
McCarrick 0 298 6
has 0 298 6
been 0 298 6
proven 0 298 6
to 0 298 6
be 0 298 6
a 1 298 6
life-long 1 298 6
homosexual 1 298 6
rapist 1 298 6
and 1 298 6
sexual 1 298 6
predator, 1 298 6
grooming 0 298 6
and 0 298 6
trapping 0 298 6
young 0 298 6
men 0 298 6
and 0 298 6
children 0 298 6
into 0 298 6
unwanted 0 298 6
sexual 0 298 6
contact; 0 298 6
and 0 298 6
that 0 298 6
nearly 0 298 6
the 0 298 6
entire 0 298 6
episcopate 0 298 6
of 0 298 6
the 0 298 6
United 0 298 6
States 0 298 6
either 0 298 6
colluded 0 298 6
directly 0 298 6
or 0 298 6
kept 0 298 6
quiet 0 298 6
about 0 298 6
it. 0 298 6

It’s 0 298 7
clear 0 298 7
that 0 298 7
even 0 298 7
the 0 298 7
“good 0 298 7
bishops” 0 298 7
have 0 298 7
simply 0 298 7
no 0 298 7
idea 0 298 7
how 0 298 7
close 0 298 7
they 0 298 7
are 0 298 7
to 0 298 7
being 0 298 7
bodily 0 298 7
chucked 0 298 7
out 0 298 7
of 0 298 7
their 0 298 7
own 0 298 7
churches 0 298 7
by 0 298 7
furious 0 298 7
mobs. 0 298 7

As 0 298 8
I 0 298 8
wrote 0 298 8
elsewhere, 0 298 8
since 0 298 8
2002, 0 298 8
most 0 298 8
Catholics 0 298 8
know 0 298 8
perfectly 1 298 8
well, 0 298 8
despite 0 298 8
the 0 298 8
lame 1 298 8
whitewashing 0 298 8
attempt, 0 298 8
that 0 298 8
“the 0 298 8
US 0 298 8
bishops 0 298 8
gave 0 298 8
themselves 0 298 8
a 0 298 8
pass” 0 298 8
on 0 298 8
clerical 0 298 8
sex 0 298 8
abuse 0 298 8
with 0 298 8
the 0 298 8
Dallas 0 298 8
Charter 0 298 8
“a 0 298 8
thing 0 298 8
that 0 298 8
brazenly 0 298 8
shifted 0 298 8
blame.” 0 298 8
And 0 298 8
it 0 298 8
seems 0 298 8
that 0 298 8
though 0 298 8
they’re 0 298 8
still 0 298 8
doing 0 298 8
this, 0 298 8
quite 0 298 8
a 0 298 8
few 0 298 8
lay 0 298 8
Catholics 0 298 8
just 0 298 8
aren’t 0 298 8
having 0 298 8
it. 0 298 8

We 0 298 9
are 0 298 9
seeing 0 298 9
the 0 298 9
final 0 298 9
slide, 0 298 9
the 0 298 9
expected 0 298 9
and 0 298 9
inevitable 0 298 9
result 0 298 9
of 0 298 9
the 0 298 9
last 0 298 9
100 0 298 9
years. 0 298 9

The 0 298 10
Church 0 298 10
was 0 298 10
infiltrated, 0 298 10
we 0 298 10
know 0 298 10
this, 0 298 10
in 0 298 10
the 0 298 10
19th 0 298 10
century 0 298 10
by 0 298 10
some 0 298 10
pretty 0 298 10
dark 1 298 10
forces, 1 298 10
and 0 298 10
they 0 298 10
have 0 298 10
finally 0 298 10
come 0 298 10
into 0 298 10
the 0 298 10
ascendancy 0 298 10
and 0 298 10
are 0 298 10
showing 0 298 10
themselves 0 298 10
quite 0 298 10
clearly 0 298 10
for 0 298 10
what 0 298 10
they 0 298 10
are. 0 298 10

The 0 298 11
McCarrick 0 298 11
news 0 298 11
– 0 298 11
and 0 298 11
all 0 298 11
the 0 298 11
stuff 0 298 11
swirling 0 298 11
around 0 298 11
it 0 298 11
like 0 298 11
the 0 298 11
latest 0 298 11
about 0 298 11
Bishop 0 298 11
Pineda 0 298 11
and 0 298 11
his 0 298 11
connection 0 298 11
to 0 298 11
Pope 0 298 11
Francis 0 298 11
through 0 298 11
Cardinal 0 298 11
Maradiaga 0 298 11
– 0 298 11
has 0 298 11
not 0 298 11
come 0 298 11
in 0 298 11
contrast 0 298 11
to 0 298 11
this 0 298 11
but 0 298 11
as 0 298 11
an 0 298 11
intrinsic 0 298 11
part 0 298 11
of 0 298 11
it. 0 298 11

The 0 298 12
scandal 0 298 12
of 0 298 12
McCarrick 0 298 12
is 0 298 12
simply 0 298 12
a 0 298 12
toxic 1 298 12
emission, 0 298 12
a 0 298 12
venting 0 298 12
of 0 298 12
the 0 298 12
gasses 0 298 12
that 0 298 12
build 0 298 12
up 0 298 12
naturally 0 298 12
around 0 298 12
any 0 298 12
rotting 1 298 12
thing. 0 298 12

Rod 0 298 13
Dreher[1] 0 298 13
is 0 298 13
doing 0 298 13
excellent 0 298 13
work 0 298 13
compiling 0 298 13
testimony 0 298 13
from 0 298 13
priests 0 298 13
and 0 298 13
others 0 298 13
saying 0 298 13
out 0 298 13
loud 0 298 13
at 0 298 13
last 0 298 13
what 0 298 13
many 0 298 13
of 0 298 13
us 0 298 13
had 0 298 13
known 0 298 13
for 0 298 13
many 0 298 13
years 0 298 13
about 0 298 13
McCarrick 0 298 13
and 0 298 13
his 0 298 13
gang. 0 298 13

It 0 298 14
has 0 298 14
shown 0 298 14
the 0 298 14
world 0 298 14
what 0 298 14
Traditionalists 0 298 14
have 0 298 14
known, 0 298 14
that 0 298 14
it 0 298 14
is 0 298 14
emphatically 0 298 14
NOT 0 298 14
the 0 298 14
result 0 298 14
of 0 298 14
one 0 298 14
“bad 0 298 14
apple” 0 298 14
or 0 298 14
even 0 298 14
only 0 298 14
a 0 298 14
“few” 0 298 14
as 0 298 14
the 0 298 14
hapless 0 298 14
“conservative” 0 298 14
Bishop 0 298 14
Tobin 0 298 14
tried 0 298 14
to 0 298 14
claim 0 298 14
on 0 298 14
Twitter. 0 298 14

This 0 298 15
is 0 298 15
the 0 298 15
result 0 298 15
of 0 298 15
a 0 298 15
mass-collusion. 0 298 15

As 0 298 16
our 0 298 16
friend 0 298 16
Steve 0 298 16
Skojec 0 298 16
put 0 298 16
it 0 298 16
the 0 298 16
other 0 298 16
day, 0 298 16
“We’ve 0 298 16
got 0 298 16
to 0 298 16
stop 0 298 16
pretending 0 298 16
it’s 0 298 16
just 0 298 16
the 0 298 16
progressive 0 298 16
element 0 298 16
in 0 298 16
the 0 298 16
Church. 0 298 16

The 0 298 17
‘conservatives’ 0 298 17
are 0 298 17
complicit, 0 298 17
too.” 0 298 17
In 0 298 17
short, 0 298 17
as 0 298 17
it 0 298 17
was 0 298 17
during 0 298 17
his 0 298 17
days 0 298 17
of 0 298 17
glory, 0 298 17
globe 0 298 17
trotting 0 298 17
on 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
dime 0 298 17
of 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
State 0 298 17
Department, 0 298 17
hosting 0 298 17
presidents 0 298 17
for 0 298 17
dinner 0 298 17
and 0 298 17
inviting 0 298 17
John 0 298 17
Paul 0 298 17
II 0 298 17
and 0 298 17
Mother 0 298 17
Theresa 0 298 17
to 0 298 17
tea, 0 298 17
so 0 298 17
it 0 298 17
is 0 298 17
now: 0 298 17
McCarrick 0 298 17
is 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
face 0 298 17
of 0 298 17
the 0 298 17
New 0 298 17
Paradigm. 0 298 17

Whether 0 298 18
he 0 298 18
now 0 298 18
has 0 298 18
to 0 298 18
go 0 298 18
live 0 298 18
in 0 298 18
obscurity 0 298 18
in 0 298 18
some 0 298 18
beach 0 298 18
house 0 298 18
in 0 298 18
the 0 298 18
Caymans, 0 298 18
it 0 298 18
will 0 298 18
remain 0 298 18
true: 0 298 18
McCarrick 0 298 18
is 0 298 18
the 0 298 18
“New 0 298 18
Church.” 0 298 18

A 0 298 19
point 0 298 19
that 0 298 19
Dreher’s 0 298 19
informants 0 298 19
have 0 298 19
brought 0 298 19
up 0 298 19
needs 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
be 0 298 19
made 0 298 19
emphatic: 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
homosexualist 1 298 19
cabal 1 298 19
that 0 298 19
is 0 298 19
currently 0 298 19
reported 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
be 0 298 19
dominant 0 298 19
in 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
Catholic 0 298 19
hierarchy 0 298 19
(and 0 298 19
don’t 0 298 19
imagine 0 298 19
this 0 298 19
is 0 298 19
confined 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
United 0 298 19
States 0 298 19
or 0 298 19
even 0 298 19
to 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
English 0 298 19
speaking 0 298 19
world) 0 298 19
have 0 298 19
a 0 298 19
well 0 298 19
documented 0 298 19
methodology 0 298 19
of 0 298 19
mutual 0 298 19
protection-and-threat 0 298 19
that 0 298 19
keeps 0 298 19
the 0 298 19
whole 0 298 19
apparatus 0 298 19
afloat. 0 298 19

In 0 298 20
briefest 0 298 20
and 0 298 20
simplest 0 298 20
possible 0 298 20
terms, 0 298 20
immoral 0 298 20
or 0 298 20
even 0 298 20
illegal 0 298 20
sexual 0 298 20
activity 0 298 20
is 0 298 20
preferred 0 298 20
because 0 298 20
it 0 298 20
leaves 0 298 20
a 0 298 20
man 0 298 20
open 0 298 20
to 0 298 20
blackmail, 0 298 20
to 0 298 20
control 0 298 20
through 0 298 20
fear 0 298 20
of 0 298 20
exposure[2]. 0 298 20

When 0 298 21
that 0 298 21
blackmailing 0 298 21
culture 0 298 21
becomes 0 298 21
ascendant, 0 298 21
it 0 298 21
will 0 298 21
always 0 298 21
reject 0 298 21
the 0 298 21
morally 0 298 21
upright 0 298 21
as 0 298 21
too 0 298 21
dangerous, 0 298 21
too 0 298 21
difficult 0 298 21
to 0 298 21
control. 0 298 21

This 0 298 22
is 0 298 22
why 0 298 22
faithful 0 298 22
seminarians 0 298 22
are 0 298 22
rejected 0 298 22
and 0 298 22
why 0 298 22
faithful 0 298 22
priests 0 298 22
are 0 298 22
harassed. 0 298 22

As 0 298 23
Dreher 0 298 23
reported, 0 298 23

When 0 298 24
predatory 1 298 24
gay 1 298 24
priests 1 298 24
run 0 298 24
seminaries, 0 298 24
they 0 298 24
select 0 298 24
on 0 298 24
a 0 298 24
bias 0 298 24
for 0 298 24
gay 0 298 24
candidates... 0 298 24

Gay 0 298 25
seminarians 0 298 25
who 0 298 25
intend 0 298 25
to 0 298 25
be 0 298 25
celibate, 0 298 25
Sipe 0 298 25
said, 0 298 25
face 0 298 25
tremendous 0 298 25
pressure 0 298 25
to 0 298 25
have 0 298 25
sex. 0 298 25

If 0 298 26
they 0 298 26
slip 0 298 26
up 0 298 26
even 0 298 26
once, 0 298 26
their 0 298 26
failure 0 298 26
will 0 298 26
be 0 298 26
noted, 0 298 26
and 0 298 26
shared… 0 298 26
And 0 298 26
they 0 298 26
will 0 298 26
be 0 298 26
made 0 298 26
to 0 298 26
understand 0 298 26
that 0 298 26
their 0 298 26
lapse 0 298 26
is 0 298 26
remembered. 0 298 26

Later, 0 298 27
as 0 298 27
a 0 298 27
priest, 0 298 27
predators 0 298 27
within 0 298 27
the 0 298 27
priesthood 0 298 27
have 0 298 27
that 0 298 27
knowledge 0 298 27
to 0 298 27
hold 0 298 27
over 0 298 27
the 0 298 27
heads 0 298 27
of 0 298 27
other 0 298 27
gay 0 298 27
priests, 0 298 27
to 0 298 27
keep 0 298 27
them 0 298 27
silent 0 298 27
if 0 298 27
they 0 298 27
ever 0 298 27
have 0 298 27
the 0 298 27
desire 0 298 27
to 0 298 27
blow 0 298 27
whistles. 0 298 27

When 0 298 28
I 0 298 28
was 0 298 28
covering 0 298 28
the 0 298 28
scandal 0 298 28
in 0 298 28
the 0 298 28
early 0 298 28
2000s, 0 298 28
I 0 298 28
spoke 0 298 28
to 0 298 28
several, 0 298 28
unconnected 0 298 28
heterosexual 0 298 28
men 0 298 28
— 0 298 28
priests, 0 298 28
former 0 298 28
priests, 0 298 28
seminarians 0 298 28
— 0 298 28
who 0 298 28
said 0 298 28
that 0 298 28
gay 0 298 28
seminary 0 298 28
rectors 0 298 28
or 0 298 28
diocesan 0 298 28
officials 0 298 28
encouraged 0 298 28
them 0 298 28
to 0 298 28
take 0 298 28
female 0 298 28
sexual 0 298 28
partners, 0 298 28
so 0 298 28
that 0 298 28
they 0 298 28
too 0 298 28
would 0 298 28
be 0 298 28
complicit 0 298 28
in 0 298 28
sexual 0 298 28
secret-keeping, 0 298 28
and 0 298 28
therefore 0 298 28
no 0 298 28
longer 0 298 28
[be] 0 298 28
a 0 298 28
potential 0 298 28
danger. 0 298 28

Nothing 0 298 29
in 0 298 29
a 0 298 29
system 0 298 29
like 0 298 29
that 0 298 29
is 0 298 29
a 0 298 29
greater 0 298 29
threat 0 298 29
to 0 298 29
the 0 298 29
corrupt 0 298 29
than 0 298 29
men 0 298 29
who 0 298 29
are 0 298 29
not 0 298 29
corrupt. 0 298 29

For 0 298 30
many 0 298 30
priests, 0 298 30
one 0 298 30
might 0 298 30
say 0 298 30
all 0 298 30
good 0 298 30
priests, 0 298 30
this 0 298 30
is 0 298 30
not 0 298 30
a 0 298 30
sustainable 0 298 30
situation, 0 298 30
to 0 298 30
say 0 298 30
the 0 298 30
least. 0 298 30

I’ve 0 298 31
had 0 298 31
quite 0 298 31
a 0 298 31
few 0 298 31
conversations 0 298 31
with 0 298 31
priests 0 298 31
who 0 298 31
are 0 298 31
now 0 298 31
asking 0 298 31
how 0 298 31
to 0 298 31
deal 0 298 31
with 0 298 31
it. 0 298 31

How 0 298 32
are 0 298 32
they 0 298 32
to 0 298 32
continue 0 298 32
to 0 298 32
offer 0 298 32
the 0 298 32
sacraments 0 298 32
in 0 298 32
this 0 298 32
situation? 0 298 32

Where 0 298 33
are 0 298 33
they 0 298 33
to 0 298 33
live? 0 298 33

How 0 298 34
are 0 298 34
they 0 298 34
to 0 298 34
maintain 0 298 34
themselves? 0 298 34

These 0 298 35
are 0 298 35
the 0 298 35
priests 0 298 35
who 0 298 35
did 0 298 35
make 0 298 35
it 0 298 35
through 0 298 35
this 0 298 35
institutional 0 298 35
gauntlet, 0 298 35
who 0 298 35
remain 0 298 35
faithful 0 298 35
now 0 298 35
but 0 298 35
are 0 298 35
still 0 298 35
under 0 298 35
the 0 298 35
control 0 298 35
of 0 298 35
these 0 298 35
often 0 298 35
grossly 1 298 35
corrupt 1 298 35
and 1 298 35
evil 1 298 35
men. 1 298 35

As 0 298 36
men 0 298 36
known 0 298 36
to 0 298 36
be 0 298 36
incorruptible 0 298 36
themselves, 0 298 36
there 0 298 36
is 0 298 36
a 0 298 36
big 0 298 36
target 0 298 36
painted 0 298 36
on 0 298 36
their 0 298 36
backs. 0 298 36

In 0 298 37
short, 0 298 37
not 0 298 37
only 0 298 37
can 0 298 37
a 0 298 37
bad 0 298 37
bishop 0 298 37
harry 0 298 37
a 0 298 37
man 0 298 37
out 0 298 37
of 0 298 37
his 0 298 37
ministry, 0 298 37
he 0 298 37
has 0 298 37
complete 0 298 37
control 0 298 37
over 0 298 37
the 0 298 37
priest’s 0 298 37
material 0 298 37
life. 0 298 37

The 0 298 38
bishop 0 298 38
can, 0 298 38
with 0 298 38
the 0 298 38
flick 0 298 38
of 0 298 38
a 0 298 38
pen 0 298 38
or 0 298 38
a 0 298 38
single 0 298 38
phone 0 298 38
call, 0 298 38
render 0 298 38
a 0 298 38
priest 0 298 38
homeless, 0 298 38
penniless 0 298 38
and 0 298 38
jobless. 0 298 38

And 0 298 39
these, 0 298 39
remember, 0 298 39
are 0 298 39
men, 0 298 39
often 0 298 39
well 0 298 39
on 0 298 39
in 0 298 39
years, 0 298 39
whose 0 298 39
only 0 298 39
education 0 298 39
and 0 298 39
employment 0 298 39
training 0 298 39
has 0 298 39
likely 0 298 39
been 0 298 39
academic 0 298 39
degrees 0 298 39
in 0 298 39
philosophy 0 298 39
and 0 298 39
theology, 0 298 39
and 0 298 39
whose 0 298 39
only 0 298 39
professional 0 298 39
contacts 0 298 39
are 0 298 39
ecclesiastical. 0 298 39

Moreover, 0 298 40
because 0 298 40
of 0 298 40
the 0 298 40
globalisation 0 298 40
of 0 298 40
the 0 298 40
bishop-network, 0 298 40
a 0 298 40
man 0 298 40
blackballed 0 298 40
for 0 298 40
his 0 298 40
authentic 0 298 40
Catholicity 0 298 40
will 0 298 40
be 0 298 40
a 0 298 40
pariah 0 298 40
in 0 298 40
every 0 298 40
diocese 0 298 40
in 0 298 40
the 0 298 40
world. 0 298 40

And 0 298 41
with 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
advent 0 298 41
of 0 298 41
Bergoglio 0 298 41
in 0 298 41
Rome, 0 298 41
there 0 298 41
are 0 298 41
no 0 298 41
more 0 298 41
havens; 0 298 41
as 0 298 41
many 0 298 41
of 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
former 0 298 41
Franciscan 0 298 41
Friars 0 298 41
of 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
Immaculate 0 298 41
have 0 298 41
learned, 0 298 41
the 0 298 41
blackballing 0 298 41
has 0 298 41
gone 0 298 41
global 0 298 41
with 0 298 41
this 0 298 41
pontificate. 0 298 41

He 0 298 42
will 0 298 42
remain 0 298 42
a 0 298 42
pariah 0 298 42
even 0 298 42
among 0 298 42
the 0 298 42
so-called 0 298 42
“good” 0 298 42
bishops 0 298 42
who 0 298 42
live 0 298 42
in 0 298 42
terror 0 298 42
of 0 298 42
the 0 298 42
immense 0 298 42
power 0 298 42
of 0 298 42
the 0 298 42
cabal… 0 298 42
(see 0 298 42
above 0 298 42
re: 0 298 42
McCarrick 0 298 42
& 0 298 42
President 0 298 42
Bush/John 0 298 42
Paul 0 298 42
II.) 0 298 42

I 0 298 43
have 0 298 43
been 0 298 43
hearing 0 298 43
from 0 298 43
priests 0 298 43
who 0 298 43
are 0 298 43
saying 0 298 43
in 0 298 43
effect, 0 298 43
“We’re 0 298 43
trapped 0 298 43
in 0 298 43
this 0 298 43
situation 0 298 43
and 0 298 43
forced 0 298 43
to 0 298 43
remain 0 298 43
silent 0 298 43
because 0 298 43
if 0 298 43
we 0 298 43
don’t 0 298 43
we’ll 0 298 43
not 0 298 43
only 0 298 43
be 0 298 43
unable 0 298 43
to 0 298 43
function 0 298 43
as 0 298 43
priests, 0 298 43
but 0 298 43
we’ll 0 298 43
be 0 298 43
homeless 0 298 43
and 0 298 43
penniless. 0 298 43

We’re 0 298 44
unemployable 0 298 44
in 0 298 44
any 0 298 44
other 0 298 44
field.” 0 298 44
And 0 298 44
as 0 298 44
much 0 298 44
as 0 298 44
we 0 298 44
might 0 298 44
be 0 298 44
tempted 0 298 44
to 0 298 44
say, 0 298 44
“Well 1 298 44
suck 1 298 44
it 1 298 44
up, 1 298 44
this 0 298 44
is 0 298 44
for 0 298 44
the 0 298 44
good 0 298 44
of 0 298 44
souls,” 0 298 44
the 0 298 44
reality 0 298 44
is 0 298 44
that 0 298 44
these 0 298 44
are 0 298 44
not 0 298 44
small 0 298 44
considerations. 0 298 44

Many 0 298 45
priests 0 298 45
are 0 298 45
getting 0 298 45
older 0 298 45
– 0 298 45
many 0 298 45
of 0 298 45
them 0 298 45
with 0 298 45
health 0 298 45
issues 0 298 45
– 0 298 45
and 0 298 45
a 0 298 45
man 0 298 45
who 0 298 45
has 0 298 45
already 0 298 45
given 0 298 45
20 0 298 45
or 0 298 45
30 0 298 45
years 0 298 45
of 0 298 45
his 0 298 45
life 0 298 45
to 0 298 45
the 0 298 45
Church 0 298 45
is 0 298 45
faced 0 298 45
with 0 298 45
a 0 298 45
practical 0 298 45
impossibility 0 298 45
if 0 298 45
he 0 298 45
finds 0 298 45
himself 0 298 45
blacklisted. 0 298 45

Of 0 298 46
course 0 298 46
there 0 298 46
are 0 298 46
some 0 298 46
who 0 298 46
don’t 0 298 46
fit 0 298 46
this 0 298 46
mould; 0 298 46
there 0 298 46
are 0 298 46
a 0 298 46
lot 0 298 46
of 0 298 46
second 0 298 46
careers 0 298 46
in 0 298 46
the 0 298 46
priesthood 0 298 46
and 0 298 46
plenty 0 298 46
of 0 298 46
people 0 298 46
go 0 298 46
into 0 298 46
seminary 0 298 46
after 0 298 46
some 0 298 46
years 0 298 46
in 0 298 46
the 0 298 46
normal 0 298 46
workforce 0 298 46
and 0 298 46
can 0 298 46
go 0 298 46
back 0 298 46
to 0 298 46
it 0 298 46
at 0 298 46
need. 0 298 46

Some 0 298 47
of 0 298 47
the 0 298 47
men 0 298 47
now 0 298 47
coming 0 298 47
forward 0 298 47
with 0 298 47
complaints 0 298 47
against 0 298 47
McCarrick, 0 298 47
who 0 298 47
left 0 298 47
the 0 298 47
priesthood 0 298 47
over 0 298 47
their 0 298 47
experiences, 0 298 47
have 0 298 47
gone 0 298 47
on 0 298 47
to 0 298 47
have 0 298 47
normal, 0 298 47
healthy 0 298 47
working 0 298 47
lives. 0 298 47

But 0 298 48
I 0 298 48
think 0 298 48
honestly 0 298 48
most 0 298 48
priests 0 298 48
are 0 298 48
in 0 298 48
this 0 298 48
corner 0 298 48
and 0 298 48
they 0 298 48
know 0 298 48
it 0 298 48
and 0 298 48
so 0 298 48
do 0 298 48
their 0 298 48
bishops. 0 298 48

I 0 298 49
think 0 298 49
a 0 298 49
young 0 298 49
man 0 298 49
goes 0 298 49
forward 0 298 49
in 0 298 49
great 0 298 49
faith, 0 298 49
spends 0 298 49
ten 0 298 49
to 0 298 49
fifteen 0 298 49
years 0 298 49
studying 0 298 49
philosophy 0 298 49
and 0 298 49
theology 0 298 49
- 0 298 49
fields 0 298 49
that 0 298 49
have 0 298 49
almost 0 298 49
no 0 298 49
application 0 298 49
in 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
workforce 0 298 49
outside 0 298 49
academia 0 298 49
or 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
Church 0 298 49
- 0 298 49
with 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
honest, 0 298 49
and 0 298 49
frankly 0 298 49
fair, 0 298 49
expectation 0 298 49
of 0 298 49
a 0 298 49
lifetime 0 298 49
of 0 298 49
employment 0 298 49
and 0 298 49
a 0 298 49
safety 0 298 49
net 0 298 49
at 0 298 49
the 0 298 49
end. 0 298 49

As 0 298 50
one 0 298 50
of 0 298 50
them 0 298 50
said 0 298 50
to 0 298 50
me, 0 298 50
“The 0 298 50
old 0 298 50
arrangement 0 298 50
was, 0 298 50
‘Remain 0 298 50
faithful, 0 298 50
do 0 298 50
the 0 298 50
work, 0 298 50
and 0 298 50
we 0 298 50
will 0 298 50
look 0 298 50
after 0 298 50
you. 0 298 50

We’ll 0 298 51
house, 0 298 51
feed 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
clothe 0 298 51
you 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
look 0 298 51
after 0 298 51
your 0 298 51
retirement.’ 0 298 51
The 0 298 51
new 0 298 51
arrangement 0 298 51
is 0 298 51
a 0 298 51
perversion 0 298 51
of 0 298 51
that: 0 298 51
‘Keep 0 298 51
quiet 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
go 0 298 51
along 0 298 51
with 0 298 51
it 0 298 51
all 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
you’ll 0 298 51
be 0 298 51
fine, 0 298 51
but 0 298 51
step 0 298 51
an 0 298 51
inch 0 298 51
out 0 298 51
of 0 298 51
line 0 298 51
and 0 298 51
we’ll 1 298 51
destroy 1 298 51
you.’” 1 298 51

So 0 298 52
what 0 298 52
do 0 298 52
we 0 298 52
do? 0 298 52

The 0 298 53
Old 0 298 53
Paradigm 0 298 53
is 0 298 53
destroyed 0 298 53
and 0 298 53
going 0 298 53
along 0 298 53
with 0 298 53
the 0 298 53
New 0 298 53
Paradigm 0 298 53
is 0 298 53
a 0 298 53
guarantee 0 298 53
of 0 298 53
destruction 0 298 53
for 0 298 53
yourself 0 298 53
and 0 298 53
everyone 0 298 53
else. 0 298 53

As 0 298 54
we 0 298 54
saw 0 298 54
in 0 298 54
Ireland 0 298 54
this 0 298 54
week, 0 298 54
the 0 298 54
Purge 0 298 54
has 0 298 54
started. 0 298 54

It’s 0 298 55
not 0 298 55
enough 0 298 55
to 0 298 55
simply 0 298 55
demand 0 298 55
that 0 298 55
a 0 298 55
priest 0 298 55
continue 0 298 55
in 0 298 55
his 0 298 55
ministry 0 298 55
no 0 298 55
matter 0 298 55
what. 0 298 55

We 0 298 56
need 0 298 56
to 0 298 56
start 0 298 56
working 0 298 56
together 0 298 56
with 0 298 56
faithful 0 298 56
priests 0 298 56
– 0 298 56
while 0 298 56
there 0 298 56
still 0 298 56
are 0 298 56
some 0 298 56
– 0 298 56
to 0 298 56
help 0 298 56
them 0 298 56
create 0 298 56
practical 0 298 56
material 0 298 56
alternatives. 0 298 56

If 0 298 57
we 0 298 57
who 0 298 57
still 0 298 57
love 0 298 57
the 0 298 57
Church 0 298 57
want 0 298 57
priests 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
be 0 298 57
faithful, 0 298 57
and 0 298 57
even 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
start 0 298 57
denouncing 0 298 57
the 0 298 57
evil 0 298 57
and 0 298 57
corruption 0 298 57
they 0 298 57
see, 0 298 57
we 0 298 57
are 0 298 57
going 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
have 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
help 0 298 57
them 0 298 57
create 0 298 57
a 0 298 57
modicum 0 298 57
of 0 298 57
independence 0 298 57
and 0 298 57
security 0 298 57
in 0 298 57
which 0 298 57
to 0 298 57
do 0 298 57
it. 0 298 57

The 0 298 58
other 0 298 58
day 0 298 58
the 0 298 58
American 0 298 58
conservative 0 298 58
writer, 0 298 58
John 0 298 58
Zmirak, 0 298 58
wrote 0 298 58
a 0 298 58
sound 0 298 58
suggestion 0 298 58
on 0 298 58
Twitter 0 298 58
that 0 298 58
I 0 298 58
think 0 298 58
it’s 0 298 58
time 0 298 58
we 0 298 58
all 0 298 58
started 0 298 58
taking 0 298 58
seriously. 0 298 58

In 0 298 59
response 0 298 59
to 0 298 59
the 0 298 59
continued 0 298 59
outrages 0 298 59
of 0 298 59
both 0 298 59
“good” 0 298 59
and 0 298 59
bad 0 298 59
bishops, 0 298 59
Zmirak 0 298 59
suggested 0 298 59
establishing 0 298 59
“an 0 298 59
escrow 0 298 59
fund 0 298 59
in 0 298 59
each 0 298 59
scandal-plagued 0 298 59
diocese, 0 298 59
where 0 298 59
laymen 0 298 59
[can] 0 298 59
deposit 0 298 59
the 0 298 59
funds 0 298 59
they 0 298 59
would 0 298 59
have 0 298 59
donated 0 298 59
to 0 298 59
[the] 0 298 59
local 0 298 59
church, 0 298 59
until 0 298 59
[a] 0 298 59
new 0 298 59
bishop 0 298 59
[is] 0 298 59
appointed.” 0 298 59

I 0 298 60
responded: 0 298 60
“And 0 298 60
the 0 298 60
money 0 298 60
could 0 298 60
be 0 298 60
used 0 298 60
to 0 298 60
purchase 0 298 60
properties 0 298 60
to 0 298 60
house 0 298 60
faithful 0 298 60
priests 0 298 60
punished 0 298 60
by 0 298 60
their 0 298 60
bishops 0 298 60
for 0 298 60
refusing 0 298 60
the 0 298 60
New 0 298 60
Paradigm. 0 298 60

We 0 298 61
could 0 298 61
even 0 298 61
perhaps 0 298 61
buy 0 298 61
a 0 298 61
few 0 298 61
convents 0 298 61
so 0 298 61
contemplative 0 298 61
nuns 0 298 61
could 0 298 61
continue 0 298 61
to 0 298 61
pray 0 298 61
in 0 298 61
peace, 0 298 61
without 0 298 61
harassment 0 298 61
from 0 298 61
the 0 298 61
evil 0 298 61
men 0 298 61
in 0 298 61
Rome.” 0 298 61

I 0 298 62
am 0 298 62
hearing 0 298 62
lately 0 298 62
from 0 298 62
laymen 0 298 62
who 0 298 62
are 0 298 62
starting 0 298 62
to 0 298 62
talk 0 298 62
about 0 298 62
setting 0 298 62
up 0 298 62
financial 0 298 62
structures 0 298 62
to 0 298 62
ensure 0 298 62
that 0 298 62
the 0 298 62
authentic 0 298 62
Catholic 0 298 62
life 0 298 62
can 0 298 62
be 0 298 62
maintained 0 298 62
through 0 298 62
what 0 298 62
is 0 298 62
obviously 0 298 62
soon 0 298 62
to 0 298 62
be 0 298 62
a 0 298 62
general 0 298 62
collapse 0 298 62
of 0 298 62
the 0 298 62
institution. 0 298 62

This 0 298 63
would 0 298 63
mean 0 298 63
independent 0 298 63
non-profit 0 298 63
foundations 0 298 63
that 0 298 63
could 0 298 63
build 0 298 63
or 0 298 63
buy 0 298 63
church 0 298 63
buildings, 0 298 63
convents 0 298 63
and 0 298 63
even 0 298 63
schools 0 298 63
and 0 298 63
provide 0 298 63
salaries 0 298 63
for 0 298 63
priests 0 298 63
and 0 298 63
other 0 298 63
staff. 0 298 63

I 0 298 64
started 0 298 64
thinking 0 298 64
about 0 298 64
this 0 298 64
recently 0 298 64
when 0 298 64
I 0 298 64
received 0 298 64
a 0 298 64
note 0 298 64
from 0 298 64
a 0 298 64
reader 0 298 64
with 0 298 64
a 0 298 64
link 0 298 64
to 0 298 64
an 0 298 64
online 0 298 64
petition 0 298 64
from 0 298 64
Germany, 0 298 64
addressed 0 298 64
to 0 298 64
the 0 298 64
German 0 298 64
bishops 0 298 64
[!!!] 0 298 64

“begging” 0 298 65
those 0 298 65
manifestly 1 298 65
evil 1 298 65
and 1 298 65
apostate 1 298 65
men 1 298 65
not 0 298 65
to 0 298 65
close 0 298 65
a 0 298 65
famous 0 298 65
and 0 298 65
ancient 0 298 65
monastic 0 298 65
house. 0 298 65

I 0 298 66
responded 0 298 66
that 0 298 66
this 0 298 66
was 0 298 66
going 0 298 66
about 0 298 66
things 0 298 66
the 0 298 66
wrong 0 298 66
way. 0 298 66

Catholics 0 298 67
are 0 298 67
going 0 298 67
to 0 298 67
have 0 298 67
to 0 298 67
get 0 298 67
their 0 298 67
heads 0 298 67
out 0 298 67
of 0 298 67
the 0 298 67
mindset 0 298 67
that 0 298 67
they 0 298 67
are 0 298 67
helpless 0 298 67
petitioners, 0 298 67
“begging” 0 298 67
the 0 298 67
hierarchy 0 298 67
to 0 298 67
maintain 0 298 67
the 0 298 67
Faith. 0 298 67

First 0 298 68
of 0 298 68
all, 0 298 68
it 0 298 68
only 0 298 68
gives 0 298 68
them 0 298 68
a 0 298 68
frisson 0 298 68
of 0 298 68
pleasure 0 298 68
to 0 298 68
see 0 298 68
us 0 298 68
groveling 0 298 68
and 0 298 68
begging 0 298 68
for 0 298 68
mercy. 0 298 68

Let’s 0 298 69
not 0 298 69
give 0 298 69
them 0 298 69
that, 0 298 69
OK? 0 298 69

There’s 0 298 70
already 0 298 70
enough 0 298 70
“frissons 0 298 70
of 0 298 70
pleasure” 0 298 70
in 0 298 70
their 0 298 70
lives. 0 298 70

Second, 0 298 71
it’s 0 298 71
simply 0 298 71
not 0 298 71
going 0 298 71
to 0 298 71
work. 0 298 71

In 0 298 72
Germany, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
US, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
Canada, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
Italy, 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
Britain… 0 298 72
throughout 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
Church 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
1st 0 298 72
world, 0 298 72
and 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
much 0 298 72
of 0 298 72
it 0 298 72
elsewhere, 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
men 0 298 72
in 0 298 72
charge 0 298 72
of 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
“institutional 0 298 72
Church” 0 298 72
– 0 298 72
that 0 298 72
is, 0 298 72
whose 0 298 72
names 0 298 72
are 0 298 72
on 0 298 72
the 0 298 72
bank 0 298 72
accounts 0 298 72
– 0 298 72
are 0 298 72
dedicated 1 298 72
to 1 298 72
the 1 298 72
destruction 1 298 72
of 1 298 72
everything 1 298 72
we 1 298 72
want 1 298 72
to 1 298 72
preserve. 1 298 72

The 0 298 73
wolves 1 298 73
are 0 298 73
now 0 298 73
looking 0 298 73
with 0 298 73
ravening 0 298 73
eyes 0 298 73
at 0 298 73
the 0 298 73
faithful. 0 298 73

They 0 298 74
are, 0 298 74
in 0 298 74
short, 0 298 74
our 1 298 74
enemies. 1 298 74

They’ve 0 298 75
become 0 298 75
so 0 298 75
by 0 298 75
making 0 298 75
themselves 0 298 75
the 0 298 75
enemies 0 298 75
of 0 298 75
Christ 0 298 75
and 0 298 75
His 0 298 75
Holy 0 298 75
Church. 0 298 75

They 0 298 76
know 0 298 76
it 0 298 76
and 0 298 76
it’s 0 298 76
time 0 298 76
we 0 298 76
stopped 0 298 76
imagining 0 298 76
otherwise. 0 298 76

The 0 298 77
other 0 298 77
suggestion 0 298 77
I 0 298 77
have 0 298 77
is 0 298 77
for 0 298 77
young 0 298 77
men 0 298 77
interested 0 298 77
in 0 298 77
the 0 298 77
priesthood 0 298 77
to 0 298 77
fortify 0 298 77
themselves 0 298 77
not 0 298 77
only 0 298 77
spiritually 0 298 77
but 0 298 77
in 0 298 77
the 0 298 77
material 0 298 77
sphere. 0 298 77

There’s 0 298 78
one 0 298 78
big 0 298 78
vulnerability 0 298 78
we 0 298 78
can 0 298 78
guard 0 298 78
against 0 298 78
pretty 0 298 78
easily. 0 298 78

No 0 298 79
one 0 298 79
should 0 298 79
be 0 298 79
facing 0 298 79
penury 0 298 79
and 0 298 79
permanent 0 298 79
unemployment 0 298 79
because 0 298 79
he’s 0 298 79
a 0 298 79
faithful 0 298 79
Catholic. 0 298 79

We 0 298 80
should 0 298 80
never 0 298 80
be 0 298 80
letting 0 298 80
any 0 298 80
young 0 298 80
man 0 298 80
go 0 298 80
into 0 298 80
any 0 298 80
diocesan 0 298 80
seminary 0 298 80
without 0 298 80
being 0 298 80
a 0 298 80
property 0 298 80
owner. 0 298 80

He 0 298 81
should 0 298 81
own 0 298 81
a 0 298 81
house 0 298 81
or 0 298 81
stand 0 298 81
to 0 298 81
inherit 0 298 81
one. 0 298 81

Families 0 298 82
have 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
come 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
see 0 298 82
this 0 298 82
as 0 298 82
a 0 298 82
duty 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
the 0 298 82
child 0 298 82
and 0 298 82
to 0 298 82
the 0 298 82
Church. 0 298 82

And 0 298 83
more 0 298 83
than 0 298 83
that, 0 298 83
the 0 298 83
potential 0 298 83
priest 0 298 83
needs 0 298 83
to 0 298 83
have 0 298 83
job 0 298 83
skills 0 298 83
that 0 298 83
have 0 298 83
nothing 0 298 83
to 0 298 83
do 0 298 83
with 0 298 83
the 0 298 83
priesthood. 0 298 83

Among 0 298 84
the 0 298 84
working 0 298 84
classes 0 298 84
there 0 298 84
is 0 298 84
a 0 298 84
bias 0 298 84
against 0 298 84
intellectual 0 298 84
work. 0 298 84

But 0 298 85
most 0 298 85
working 0 298 85
class 0 298 85
people 0 298 85
have 0 298 85
a 0 298 85
pretty 0 298 85
sensible 0 298 85
attitude 0 298 85
towards 0 298 85
ambitions 0 298 85
in 0 298 85
academia: 0 298 85
get 0 298 85
something 0 298 85
under 0 298 85
your 0 298 85
belt 0 298 85
you 0 298 85
can 0 298 85
fall 0 298 85
back 0 298 85
on. 0 298 85

How 0 298 86
many 0 298 86
philosophy 0 298 86
PhDs 0 298 86
can 0 298 86
build 0 298 86
himself 0 298 86
a 0 298 86
bookshelf? 0 298 86

Change 0 298 87
the 0 298 87
oil 0 298 87
in 0 298 87
a 0 298 87
car? 0 298 87

Rewire 0 298 88
a 0 298 88
house? 0 298 88

The 0 298 89
standard 0 298 89
cliché 0 298 89
of 0 298 89
young 0 298 89
people 0 298 89
with 0 298 89
useless 0 298 89
academic 0 298 89
degrees 0 298 89
working 0 298 89
at 0 298 89
Starbucks 0 298 89
has 0 298 89
become 0 298 89
so 0 298 89
common 0 298 89
it’s 0 298 89
not 0 298 89
even 0 298 89
worth 0 298 89
memeing 0 298 89
anymore. 0 298 89

How 0 298 90
many 0 298 90
young 0 298 90
men 0 298 90
do 0 298 90
we 0 298 90
foresee 0 298 90
being 0 298 90
forced 0 298 90
out 0 298 90
of 0 298 90
seminary 0 298 90
for 0 298 90
having 0 298 90
the 0 298 90
wrong 0 298 90
“sexual 0 298 90
orientation”? 0 298 90

Every 0 298 91
one 0 298 91
of 0 298 91
those 0 298 91
guys 0 298 91
needs 0 298 91
to 0 298 91
be 0 298 91
able 0 298 91
to 0 298 91
snap 0 298 91
his 0 298 91
fingers 0 298 91
in 0 298 91
the 0 298 91
face 0 298 91
of 0 298 91
the 0 298 91
rector 0 298 91
and 0 298 91
walk 0 298 91
straight 0 298 91
into 0 298 91
a 0 298 91
decent 0 298 91
job, 0 298 91
based 0 298 91
not 0 298 91
on 0 298 91
any 0 298 91
recommendation 0 298 91
from 0 298 91
a 0 298 91
corrupt 0 298 91
bishop, 0 298 91
but 0 298 91
on 0 298 91
his 0 298 91
solid 0 298 91
skills. 0 298 91

Among 0 298 92
the 0 298 92
white 0 298 92
collar 0 298 92
classes 0 298 92
there 0 298 92
is 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
bias 0 298 92
against 0 298 92
blue 0 298 92
collar 0 298 92
work, 0 298 92
but 0 298 92
the 0 298 92
trades 0 298 92
are 0 298 92
crying 0 298 92
out 0 298 92
for 0 298 92
skilled 0 298 92
men 0 298 92
and 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
trade 0 298 92
school 0 298 92
diploma 0 298 92
in 0 298 92
fixing 0 298 92
tractors 0 298 92
is 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
lot 0 298 92
cheaper 0 298 92
and 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
lot 0 298 92
faster 0 298 92
to 0 298 92
get 0 298 92
than 0 298 92
a 0 298 92
university 0 298 92
degree. 0 298 92

That’s 0 298 93
an 0 298 93
economic 0 298 93
asset 0 298 93
that 0 298 93
we 0 298 93
can’t 0 298 93
afford 0 298 93
to 0 298 93
turn 0 298 93
up 0 298 93
our 0 298 93
well-educated 0 298 93

It 0 298 95
reminds 0 298 95
me 0 298 95
of 0 298 95
a 0 298 95
discussion 0 298 95
I 0 298 95
had 0 298 95
some 0 298 95
years 0 298 95
ago 0 298 95
with 0 298 95
the 0 298 95
prior 0 298 95
of 0 298 95
a 0 298 95
Benedictine 0 298 95
monastery 0 298 95
that 0 298 95
is 0 298 95
attracting 0 298 95
a 0 298 95
lot 0 298 95
of 0 298 95
young 0 298 95
vocations. 0 298 95

One 0 298 96
kid 0 298 96
wanted 0 298 96
to 0 298 96
join 0 298 96
and 0 298 96
told 0 298 96
me 0 298 96
they 0 298 96
had 0 298 96
recommended 0 298 96
he 0 298 96
go 0 298 96
to 0 298 96
some 0 298 96
college 0 298 96
or 0 298 96
other 0 298 96
to 0 298 96
study 0 298 96
philosophy 0 298 96
first. 0 298 96

This 0 298 97
college, 0 298 97
apparently, 0 298 97
waives 0 298 97
much 0 298 97
of 0 298 97
the 0 298 97
tuition 0 298 97
and 0 298 97
gives 0 298 97
work 0 298 97
studies 0 298 97
to 0 298 97
people 0 298 97
going 0 298 97
for 0 298 97
the 0 298 97
priesthood 0 298 97
and 0 298 97
religious 0 298 97
life 0 298 97
so 0 298 97
they 0 298 97
can 0 298 97
avoid 0 298 97
the 0 298 97
student 0 298 97
loan 0 298 97
trap. 0 298 97

This 0 298 98
is 0 298 98
fine, 0 298 98
good 0 298 98
idea. 0 298 98

But 0 298 99
I 0 298 99
asked 0 298 99
him 0 298 99
what 0 298 99
he 0 298 99
knew 0 298 99
how 0 298 99
to 0 298 99
do. 0 298 99

“Can 0 298 100
you 0 298 100
fix 0 298 100
a 0 298 100
bathroom 0 298 100
pipe? 0 298 100

Do 0 298 101
you 0 298 101
know 0 298 101
anything 0 298 101
about 0 298 101
what 0 298 101
to 0 298 101
feed 0 298 101
a 0 298 101
sheep 0 298 101
or 0 298 101
how 0 298 101
to 0 298 101
care 0 298 101
for 0 298 101
a 0 298 101
cow? 0 298 101

Can 0 298 102
you 0 298 102
drive 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
tractor?” 0 298 102
This 0 298 102
nice 0 298 102
kid, 0 298 102
who 0 298 102
certainly 0 298 102
does 0 298 102
have 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
vocation, 0 298 102
could 0 298 102
read 0 298 102
books 0 298 102
and 0 298 102
look 0 298 102
things 0 298 102
up 0 298 102
on 0 298 102
the 0 298 102
internet 0 298 102
and 0 298 102
write 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
pretty 0 298 102
mean 0 298 102
paper 0 298 102
on 0 298 102
Thomas 0 298 102
Aquinas, 0 298 102
but 0 298 102
not 0 298 102
a 0 298 102
lot 0 298 102
else. 0 298 102

There 0 298 103
is 0 298 103
going 0 298 103
to 0 298 103
have 0 298 103
to 0 298 103
be 0 298 103
a 0 298 103
shift 0 298 103
in 0 298 103
attitude 0 298 103
in 0 298 103
our 0 298 103
remaining 0 298 103
faithful 0 298 103
institutions. 0 298 103

Does 0 298 104
a 0 298 104
monastery 0 298 104
really 0 298 104
need 0 298 104
all 0 298 104
of 0 298 104
its 0 298 104
members 0 298 104
to 0 298 104
have 0 298 104
PhDs 0 298 104
in 0 298 104
philosophy 0 298 104
and 0 298 104
theology? 0 298 104

Wouldn’t 0 298 105
it 0 298 105
also 0 298 105
be 0 298 105
useful 0 298 105
to 0 298 105
have 0 298 105
an 0 298 105
electrician, 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
plumber, 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
carpenter, 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
cook, 0 298 105
someone 0 298 105
who 0 298 105
knows 0 298 105
how 0 298 105
to 0 298 105
fix 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
car 0 298 105
or 0 298 105
a 0 298 105
tractor? 0 298 105

Or 0 298 106
for 0 298 106
that 0 298 106
matter, 0 298 106
a 0 298 106
certified 0 298 106
accountant 0 298 106
or 0 298 106
an 0 298 106
investment 0 298 106
banker? 0 298 106

If 0 298 107
you 0 298 107
insist 0 298 107
on 0 298 107
having 0 298 107
people 0 298 107
with 0 298 107
degrees, 0 298 107
maybe 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
degree 0 298 107
in 0 298 107
agriculture 0 298 107
would 0 298 107
be 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
good 0 298 107
fit 0 298 107
for 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
big 0 298 107
monastic 0 298 107
foundation 0 298 107
with 0 298 107
a 0 298 107
lot 0 298 107
of 0 298 107
land 0 298 107
like, 0 298 107
say, 0 298 107
Clear 0 298 107
Creek 0 298 107
or 0 298 107
that 0 298 107
new 0 298 107
Carmelite 0 298 107
place 0 298 107
in 0 298 107
Nebraska. 0 298 107

I 0 298 108
think 0 298 108
this 0 298 108
is 0 298 108
the 0 298 108
time 0 298 108
we 0 298 108
are 0 298 108
going 0 298 108
to 0 298 108
have 0 298 108
to 0 298 108
start 0 298 108
overcoming 0 298 108
our 0 298 108
class 0 298 108
snobbery. 0 298 108

Young 0 298 109
men 0 298 109
with 0 298 109
ambitions 0 298 109
for 0 298 109
the 0 298 109
priesthood 0 298 109
are 0 298 109
going 0 298 109
to 0 298 109
have 0 298 109
to 0 298 109
tuck 0 298 109
away 0 298 109
employability 0 298 109
and 0 298 109
an 0 298 109
independent 0 298 109
financial 0 298 109
foundation, 0 298 109
in 0 298 109
the 0 298 109
same 0 298 109
way 0 298 109
people 0 298 109
used 0 298 109
to 0 298 109
tuck 0 298 109
money 0 298 109
away 0 298 109
against 0 298 109
a 0 298 109
rainy 0 298 109
day. 0 298 109

Simply 0 298 110
put, 0 298 110
they’ve 0 298 110
got 0 298 110
to 0 298 110
stop 0 298 110
being 0 298 110
materially 0 298 110
dependent 0 298 110
on 0 298 110
the 0 298 110
hierarchy. 0 298 110

This 0 298 111
vulnerability 0 298 111
is 0 298 111
a 0 298 111
gun 0 298 111
to 0 298 111
their 0 298 111
heads 0 298 111
in 0 298 111
this 0 298 111
time. 0 298 111

The 0 298 112
next 0 298 112
kid 0 298 112
who 0 298 112
says 0 298 112
anything 0 298 112
to 0 298 112
me 0 298 112
about 0 298 112
wanting 0 298 112
to 0 298 112
enter 0 298 112
the 0 298 112
diocesan 0 298 112
priesthood, 0 298 112
I’m 0 298 112
going 0 298 112
to 0 298 112
ask, 0 298 112
“How 0 298 112
sound 0 298 112
is 0 298 112
your 0 298 112
investment 0 298 112
portfolio?” 0 298 112
The 0 298 112
next 0 298 112
candidate 0 298 112
for 0 298 112
religious 0 298 112
life, 0 298 112
I’ll 0 298 112
ask, 0 298 112
“Great! 0 298 112

What’s 0 298 113
your 0 298 113
trade? 0 298 113

What 0 298 114
do 0 298 114
you 0 298 114
have 0 298 114
to 0 298 114
fall 0 298 114
back 0 298 114
on?” 0 298 114

I’m 0 298 115
given 0 298 115
to 0 298 115
understand 0 298 115
that 0 298 115
some 0 298 115
houses 0 298 115
of 0 298 115
the 0 298 115
Congregation 0 298 115
of 0 298 115
the 0 298 115
Oratory 0 298 115
ask 0 298 115
candidates 0 298 115
to 0 298 115
come 0 298 115
with 0 298 115
an 0 298 115
independent 0 298 115
income, 0 298 115
which, 0 298 115
given 0 298 115
what 0 298 115
we’re 0 298 115
seeing 0 298 115
elsewhere 0 298 115
doesn’t 0 298 115
sound 0 298 115
like 0 298 115
a 0 298 115
bad 0 298 115
idea. 0 298 115

Perhaps 0 298 116
Catholic 0 298 116
financial 0 298 116
advisors 0 298 116
could 0 298 116
be 0 298 116
encouraged 0 298 116
to 0 298 116
set 0 298 116
up 0 298 116
a 0 298 116
programme 0 298 116
to 0 298 116
teach 0 298 116
young 0 298 116
men 0 298 116
how 0 298 116
to 0 298 116
create 0 298 116
a 0 298 116
sound 0 298 116
financial 0 298 116
footing 0 298 116
with 0 298 116
investments. 0 298 116

Meanwhile, 0 298 117
we 0 298 117
must 0 298 117
refocus 0 298 117
our 0 298 117
energy 0 298 117
on 0 298 117
the 0 298 117
Faith 0 298 117
itself, 0 298 117
instead 0 298 117
of 0 298 117
the 0 298 117
physical 0 298 117
and 0 298 117
even 0 298 117
canonical 0 298 117
structures 0 298 117
that 0 298 117
house 0 298 117
it. 0 298 117

That 0 298 118
monastery 0 298 118
in 0 298 118
Germany 0 298 118
is 0 298 118
lost. 0 298 118

Those 0 298 119
bishops 0 298 119
want 0 298 119
the 0 298 119
property 0 298 119
and 0 298 119
they’ll 0 298 119
get 0 298 119
it. 0 298 119

What 0 298 120
the 0 298 120
group 0 298 120
of 0 298 120
laymen 0 298 120
should 0 298 120
be 0 298 120
doing, 0 298 120
instead 0 298 120
of 0 298 120
petitioning 0 298 120
that 0 298 120
it 0 298 120
be 0 298 120
saved, 0 298 120
is 0 298 120
finding 0 298 120
a 0 298 120
place 0 298 120
where 0 298 120
the 0 298 120
nuns 0 298 120
can 0 298 120
live 0 298 120
their 0 298 120
charism 0 298 120
of 0 298 120
religious 0 298 120
life 0 298 120
without 0 298 120
episcopal 0 298 120
harassment. 0 298 120

Bishops 0 298 121
won’t 0 298 121
protect 0 298 121
and 0 298 121
support 0 298 121
good 0 298 121
priests? 0 298 121

Then 1 298 122
it’s 1 298 122
up 1 298 122
to 1 298 122
us. 1 298 122

The 0 298 123
Vatican 0 298 123
wants 0 298 123
to 0 298 123
force 0 298 123
all 0 298 123
religious 0 298 123
congregations 0 298 123
into 0 298 123
the 0 298 123
pants-wearing, 0 298 123
Marxist 0 298 123
anti-nun, 0 298 123
LCWR 0 298 123
pattern? 0 298 123

We’re 0 298 124
not 0 298 124
helpless. 0 298 124

We 0 298 125
start 0 298 125
buying 0 298 125
convent 0 298 125
buildings 0 298 125
and 0 298 125
start 0 298 125
a 0 298 125
fund 0 298 125
to 0 298 125
support 0 298 125
the 0 298 125
nun-refugees. 0 298 125

Our 0 298 126
goal 0 298 126
must 0 298 126
be 0 298 126
preserving 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
precious 0 298 126
treasure, 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
Deposit 0 298 126
of 0 298 126
the 0 298 126
Faith, 0 298 126
the 0 298 126

the 0 298 126

and 0 298 126
artifacts 0 298 126
of 0 298 126
the 0 298 126

I 0 298 127
am 0 298 127
reminded 0 298 127
of 0 298 127
what 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
curators 0 298 127
of 0 298 127
the 0 298 127

Museum 0 298 127
in 0 298 127
St. 0 298 127
Petersburg 0 298 127
did 0 298 127
in 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
face 0 298 127
of 0 298 127
the 0 298 127
advancing 0 298 127
German 0 298 127
army. 0 298 127

They 0 298 128
took 0 298 128
down, 0 298 128
packed 0 298 128
up 0 298 128
and 0 298 128
hid 0 298 128
the 0 298 128
art 0 298 128
treasures, 0 298 128
some 0 298 128
of 0 298 128
the 0 298 128
greatest 0 298 128
in 0 298 128
the 0 298 128
world. 0 298 128

Over 0 298 129
a 0 298 129
million 0 298 129
precious 0 298 129
works 0 298 129
of 0 298 129
art 0 298 129
were 0 298 129
sent 0 298 129
on 0 298 129
trains 0 298 129
to 0 298 129
be 0 298 129
hidden 0 298 129
in 0 298 129
the 0 298 129
Urals. 0 298 129

Two 0 298 130
trains 0 298 130
got 0 298 130
away 0 298 130
to 0 298 130
safety, 0 298 130
but 0 298 130
one 0 298 130
was 0 298 130
still 0 298 130
there 0 298 130
when 0 298 130
the 0 298 130
Germans 0 298 130
surrounded 0 298 130
the 0 298 130
city 0 298 130
and 0 298 130
began 0 298 130
the 0 298 130
siege. 0 298 130

The 0 298 131

us: 0 298 131

To 0 298 137
keep 0 298 137
up 0 298 137
everyone’s 0 298 137
morale, 0 298 137
the 0 298 137
museum 0 298 137
staff, 0 298 137
while 0 298 137

they 0 298 137

perfectly 0 298 137
the 0 298 137
artworks 0 298 137
that 0 298 137
had 0 298 137
been 0 298 137
removed. 0 298 137

They 0 298 138
understood 0 298 138
the 0 298 138
value 0 298 138
of 0 298 138
what 0 298 138
they 0 298 138
had, 0 298 138

did 0 298 138
everything 0 298 138

Does 0 298 139
this 0 298 139
all 0 298 139
sound 0 298 139
a 0 298 139
bit, 0 298 139
well, 0 298 139
schismatic? 0 298 139

Not 0 298 140
necessarily. 0 298 140

Any 0 298 141
bishop 0 298 141
who 0 298 141
can 0 298 141
demonstrate 0 298 141
through 0 298 141
his 0 298 141
actions 0 298 141
and 0 298 141
not 0 298 141
just 0 298 141
with 0 298 141
his 0 298 141
tweets, 0 298 141
who 0 298 141
can 0 298 141
prove 0 298 141
that 0 298 141
he 0 298 141
is 0 298 141
still 0 298 141
a 0 298 141
Catholic 0 298 141
and 0 298 141
not 0 298 141
a 0 298 141
wolf, 1 298 141
is 0 298 141
welcome 0 298 141
to 0 298 141
join 0 298 141
us. 0 298 141

But 0 298 142
we’d 0 298 142
be 0 298 142
fools 0 298 142
to 0 298 142
wait 0 298 142
for 0 298 142
them. 0 298 142

Whatever 0 298 143
you 0 298 143
might 0 298 143
think 0 298 143
of 0 298 143
Archbishop 0 298 143
Lefebvre’s 0 298 143
solution 0 298 143
over 0 298 143
the 0 298 143
last 0 298 143
few 0 298 143
decades, 0 298 143
it 0 298 143
certainly 0 298 143
seems 0 298 143
inarguable 0 298 143
that 0 298 143
the 0 298 143
“state 0 298 143
of 0 298 143
emergency” 0 298 143
for 0 298 143
which 0 298 143
he 0 298 143
was 0 298 143
preparing 0 298 143
has 0 298 143
come 0 298 143
at 0 298 143
last. 0 298 143

And 0 298 144
in 0 298 144
a 0 298 144
state 0 298 144
of 0 298 144
emergency, 0 298 144
certain 0 298 144
norms 0 298 144
are 0 298 144
naturally 0 298 144
suspended. 0 298 144

The 0 298 145
simple 0 298 145
fact 0 298 145
is 0 298 145
that 0 298 145
soon 0 298 145
there 0 298 145
are 0 298 145
going 0 298 145
to 0 298 145
be 0 298 145
“vagus” 0 298 145
priests 0 298 145
who 0 298 145
have 0 298 145
been 0 298 145
thrown 0 298 145
out 0 298 145
of 0 298 145
their 0 298 145
ministry 0 298 145
for 0 298 145
maintaining 0 298 145
the 0 298 145
Faith. 0 298 145

There 0 298 146
are 0 298 146
going 0 298 146
to 0 298 146
be 0 298 146
nuns 0 298 146
and 0 298 146
monks 0 298 146
without 0 298 146
homes, 0 298 146
as 0 298 146
in 0 298 146
the 0 298 146
England 0 298 146
of 0 298 146
Henry 0 298 146
VIII. 0 298 146

I 0 298 147
think 0 298 147
it’s 0 298 147
only 0 298 147
reasonable 0 298 147
that 0 298 147
those 0 298 147
who 0 298 147
also 0 298 147
want 0 298 147
to 0 298 147
maintain 0 298 147
the 0 298 147
Faith 0 298 147
should 0 298 147
reach 0 298 147
out 0 298 147
to 0 298 147
them 0 298 147
and 0 298 147
offer 0 298 147
what 0 298 147
shelter 0 298 147
we 0 298 147
can. 0 298 147

What 0 298 148
we 0 298 148
have 0 298 148
seen 0 298 148
this 0 298 148
week 0 298 148
is 0 298 148
making 0 298 148
it 0 298 148
clear 0 298 148
that 0 298 148
we 0 298 148
can 0 298 148
simply 0 298 148
no 0 298 148
longer 0 298 148
sit 0 298 148
back 0 298 148
and 0 298 148
“beg” 0 298 148
bishops 0 298 148
to 0 298 148
maintain 0 298 148
and 0 298 148
defend 0 298 148
the 0 298 148
Faith. 0 298 148

It’s 0 298 149
not 0 298 149
enough 0 298 149
now 0 298 149
to 0 298 149
go 0 298 149
into 0 298 149
seminary 0 298 149
or 0 298 149
a 0 298 149
monastery 0 298 149
with 0 298 149
glowing 0 298 149
eyes 0 298 149
and 0 298 149
a 0 298 149
firm 0 298 149
faith. 0 298 149

Sentiment 0 298 150
isn’t 0 298 150
going 0 298 150
to 0 298 150
be 0 298 150
much 0 298 150
comfort 0 298 150
when 0 298 150
the 0 298 150
young 0 298 150
man 0 298 150
is 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
longer 0 298 150
so 0 298 150
very 0 298 150
young 0 298 150
and 0 298 150
finds 0 298 150
himself 0 298 150
standing 0 298 150
on 0 298 150
the 0 298 150
street 0 298 150
outside 0 298 150
the 0 298 150
chancery 0 298 150
with 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
skills, 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
money, 0 298 150
no 0 298 150
job, 0 298 150

If 0 298 151
it 0 298 151
is 0 298 151
true 0 298 151
that 0 298 151
we 0 298 151
really 0 298 151
are 0 298 151
alone 0 298 151
in 0 298 151
this, 0 298 151
then 1 298 151
so 1 298 151
be 1 298 151
it. 1 298 151

Let’s 0 298 152
stop 0 298 152
lamenting 0 298 152
and 0 298 152
start 0 298 152
doing 0 298 152
practical 0 298 152
things 0 298 152
about 0 298 152

1983. 0 298 156

This 0 298 157

at 0 298 157

2015. 0 298 159

A 0 298 160
recent 0 298 160
post 0 298 160
to 0 298 160
the 0 298 160
official 0 298 160
Regnum 0 298 160
Christi 0 298 160
website 0 298 160
shows 0 298 160
that 0 298 160
Cardinal 0 298 160
Kevin 0 298 160
is 0 298 160
still 0 298 160
close 0 298 160
enough 0 298 160
to 0 298 160
the 0 298 160
Legion-related 0 298 160
“lay” 0 298 160
organisation 0 298 160
to 0 298 160
hire 0 298 160
dicastery 0 298 160
staff 0 298 160
from 0 298 160
their 0 298 160
ranks. 0 298 160

After 0 298 161
he 0 298 161
left 0 298 161
the 0 298 161
Legion, 0 298 161
Kevin 0 298 161
Farrell 0 298 161
joined 0 298 161
the 0 298 161
diocesan 0 298 161
clergy 0 298 161
in 0 298 161
Washington 0 298 161
DC 0 298 161
and 0 298 161
became 0 298 161
a 0 298 161
protégé 0 298 161
of 0 298 161
the 0 298 161
archbishop, 0 298 161
Cardinal 0 298 161
Wuerl. 0 298 161

So 0 298 162
close 0 298 162
is 0 298 162
he 0 298 162
to 0 298 162
McCarrick 0 298 162
that 0 298 162
Farrell’s 0 298 162
coat 0 298 162
of 0 298 162
arms, 0 298 162
as 0 298 162
Elizabeth 0 298 162
Yore 0 298 162
reported 0 298 162
in 0 298 162
these 0 298 162
pages, 0 298 162
is 0 298 162
not 0 298 162
much 0 298 162
more 0 298 162
than 0 298 162
a 0 298 162
tribute 0 298 162
to 0 298 162
his 0 298 162
belatedly-disgraced 0 298 162
mentor. 0 298 162

So, 0 298 163
someone 0 298 163
in 0 298 163
a 0 298 163
journalistic 0 298 163
capacity 0 298 163
might 0 298 163
want 0 298 163
to 0 298 163
be 0 298 163
asking 0 298 163
a 0 298 163
few 0 298 163
questions 0 298 163
about 0 298 163
these 0 298 163
things 0 298 163
too. 0 298 163

[2] 0 298 164
It 0 298 164
should 0 298 164
also 0 298 164
be 0 298 164
noted 0 298 164
that 0 298 164
in 0 298 164
his 0 298 164
book, 0 298 164
The 0 298 164

Pope, 0 298 164
historian 0 298 164
Henry 0 298 164
Sire 0 298 164
documented 0 298 164
that 0 298 164
this 0 298 164
is 0 298 164
how 0 298 164
Jorge 0 298 164
Bergoglio 0 298 164
has 0 298 164
always 0 298 164
operated, 0 298 164
collecting 0 298 164
bad 0 298 164
men 0 298 164
around 0 298 164
him 0 298 164
and 0 298 164
controlling 0 298 164
them 0 298 164
with 0 298 164
a 0 298 164
masterful 0 298 164
combination 0 298 164
of 0 298 164
threats 0 298 164
and 0 298 164
rewards. 0 298 164

The 0 298 164

natural 0 298 164

question, 0 298 164

“Why 0 298 164

does 0 298 164

Pope 0 298 164

Francis 0 298 164

keep 0 298 164

such 0 298 164

bad 0 298 164

men 0 298 164

around 0 298 164

him?” 0 298 164

is 0 298 164

now 0 298 164

easy 0 298 164

to 0 298 164

answer. 0 298 164

Obama 0 300 0
Was 0 300 0
Never 0 300 0
As 0 300 0
Tough 0 300 0

This 0 300 1
is 0 300 1
just 0 300 1
silly. 1 300 1

The 0 300 2
constant 0 300 2
hand-wringing, 0 300 2
from 0 300 2
the 0 300 2
left-wing 0 300 2

over 0 300 2
President 0 300 2
Trump’s 0 300 2

and 0 300 2
his 0 300 2
connection 0 300 2
with 0 300 2
Russia 0 300 2
is 0 300 2
just 0 300 2
silly. 1 300 2

The 0 300 3
media 0 300 3
has 0 300 3
been 0 300 3
hanging 0 300 3
on 0 300 3
every 0 300 3
word 0 300 3
the 0 300 3
President 0 300 3
says 0 300 3
and 0 300 3
arguing 0 300 3
that 0 300 3
his 0 300 3
rhetoric 0 300 3
is 0 300 3
proof 0 300 3
positive 0 300 3
that 0 300 3
he 0 300 3
is 0 300 3
some 0 300 3
kind 0 300 3
of 0 300 3

that 0 300 5

Our 0 300 23

Russia 0 300 23
is 0 300 23
at 0 300 23

just 0 300 23

or 0 300 24
nuclear 0 300 24
arms. 0 300 24

I’m 0 300 25
kind 0 300 25
of 0 300 25
surprised 0 300 25
there’s 0 300 25
been 0 300 25
this 0 300 25
much 0 300 25
angst 0 300 25
over 0 300 25
this 0 300 25
press 0 300 25
conference. 0 300 25

Not 0 300 26
that 0 300 26
he 0 300 26
said 0 300 26
things 0 300 26
the 0 300 26
way 0 300 26
he 0 300 26
should 0 300 26
have. 0 300 26

President 0 300 27
Trump 0 300 27
really 0 300 27
did 0 300 27
mess 0 300 27
up 0 300 27
with 0 300 27
that 0 300 27
press 0 300 27
conference 0 300 27
but 0 300 27
I 0 300 27
don’t 0 300 27
quite 0 300 27
know 0 300 27
what 0 300 27
people 0 300 27
want. 0 300 27

He 0 300 28
actually 0 300 28
is 0 300 28
pretty 0 300 28
tough 1 300 28
on 0 300 28
Russia. 0 300 28

And 0 300 29
in 0 300 29
the 0 300 29
last 0 300 29
couple 0 300 29
of 0 300 29
years, 0 300 29
we’ve 0 300 29
seen 0 300 29
an 0 300 29
increase 0 300 29
in 0 300 29
the 0 300 29
military 0 300 29
budget, 0 300 29
we’ve 0 300 29
seen 0 300 29
an 0 300 29
increase 0 300 29
in 0 300 29
the 0 300 29
intelligence 0 300 29
budget. 0 300 29

We 0 300 30
are 0 300 30
doing 0 300 30
NATO 0 300 30
exercises 0 300 30
in 0 300 30
the 0 300 30
Baltics. 0 300 30

We 0 300 31
provided 0 300 31
legal 0 300 31
aid 0 300 31
to 0 300 31
Ukraine 0 300 31
and 0 300 31
Georgia. 0 300 31

We’re 0 300 32
developing 0 300 32
low-yield 0 300 32
nuclear 0 300 32
weapons. 0 300 32

He 0 300 33
implemented 0 300 33
sanctions 0 300 33
that 0 300 33
were 0 300 33
even 0 300 33
stronger 0 300 33
than 0 300 33
required 0 300 33
by 0 300 33
Congressional 0 300 33
mandate. 0 300 33

So 0 300 34
if 0 300 34
you 0 300 34
care 0 300 34
about 0 300 34
actual 0 300 34
actions, 0 300 34
I 0 300 34
think 0 300 34
there’s 0 300 34
a 0 300 34
lot 0 300 34
to 0 300 34
be 0 300 34
happy 0 300 34
about 0 300 34
in 0 300 34
terms 0 300 34
of 0 300 34
a 0 300 34
tough 1 300 34
posture 0 300 34
towards 0 300 34
Russia. 0 300 34

People 0 300 35
are 0 300 35
obsessed 0 300 35
about 0 300 35
words 0 300 35
and 0 300 35
they 0 300 35
should 0 300 35
maybe 0 300 35
focus 0 300 35
on 0 300 35
the 0 300 35
actions 0 300 35
as 0 300 35
well. 0 300 35

Former 0 300 36
Speaker 0 300 36
of 0 300 36
the 0 300 36
House, 0 300 36
Newt 0 300 36
Gingrich, 0 300 36
concurred 0 300 36
with 0 300 36
Hemingway 0 300 36
arguing 0 300 36
that 0 300 36
by 0 300 36
any 0 300 36
standard 0 300 36
Trump 0 300 36
has 0 300 36
been 0 300 36
far 0 300 36
tougher 0 300 36
on 0 300 36
Russia 0 300 36
than 0 300 36
Obama 0 300 36
was. 0 300 36

First, 0 300 37
the 0 300 37
very 0 300 37
people 0 300 37
who 0 300 37
have 0 300 37
been 0 300 37
loudest 0 300 37
in 0 300 37
attacking 0 300 37
President 0 300 37
Trump 0 300 37
about 0 300 37
his 0 300 37
performance 0 300 37
at 0 300 37
the 0 300 37
Helsinki 0 300 37
summit 0 300 37
are 0 300 37
the 0 300 37
people 0 300 37
who 0 300 37
failed 0 300 37
to 0 300 37
protect 1 300 37
America 1 300 37
from 0 300 37
Russian 0 300 37
meddling 0 300 37
in 0 300 37
2016. 0 300 37

The 0 300 38
very 1 300 38
intensity 0 300 38
and 0 300 38
nastiness 1 300 38
of 0 300 38
former 0 300 38
CIA 0 300 38
Director 0 300 38
Brennan 0 300 38
and 0 300 38
former 0 300 38
Director 0 300 38
of 0 300 38
National 0 300 38
Intelligence 0 300 38
Clapper 0 300 38
is 0 300 38
an 0 300 38
attempt 0 300 38
to 0 300 38
distract 0 300 38
attention 0 300 38
from 0 300 38
their 0 300 38
failure 0 300 38
to 0 300 38
protect 1 300 38
America. 1 300 38

It 0 300 39
was 0 300 39
their 0 300 39
duty 0 300 39
in 0 300 39
2016 0 300 39
– 0 300 39
not 0 300 39
candidate 0 300 39
Trump’s. 0 300 39

Second, 0 300 40
the 0 300 40
Trump 0 300 40
administration 0 300 40
has 0 300 40
been 0 300 40
far 0 300 40
tougher 1 300 40
on 0 300 40
Russia 0 300 40
than 0 300 40
President 0 300 40
Obama 0 300 40
ever 0 300 40
dreamed 0 300 40
of 0 300 40
being. 0 300 40

The 1 300 41
Trump 1 300 41
administration 1 300 41
is 0 300 41
taking 0 300 41
real 0 300 41
actions 0 300 41
designed 0 300 41
to 0 300 41
weaken 0 300 41
Russia 0 300 41
and 0 300 41
force 0 300 41
Putin 0 300 41
to 0 300 41
change 0 300 41
his 0 300 41
aggressive 1 300 41
behavior. 0 300 41

The 1 300 42
Trump 1 300 42
administration 1 300 42
has 0 300 42
levied 0 300 42
tough 1 300 42
sanctions 0 300 42
on 0 300 42
Russia. 0 300 42

Also, 0 300 43
President 0 300 43
Trump’s 0 300 43
public 0 300 43
lecture 0 300 43
about 0 300 43
Germany 0 300 43
not 0 300 43
buying 0 300 43
natural 0 300 43
gas 0 300 43
from 0 300 43
Russia 0 300 43
was 0 300 43
aimed 0 300 43
at 0 300 43
cutting 0 300 43
Putin 0 300 43
off 0 300 43
from 0 300 43
hard 0 300 43
currency 0 300 43
worth 0 300 43
tens 0 300 43
of 0 300 43
billions 0 300 43
of 0 300 43
dollars 0 300 43
and 0 300 43
further 0 300 43
weakening 0 300 43
the 0 300 43
Russian 0 300 43
economy. 0 300 43

Furthermore, 0 300 44
President 0 300 44
Trump’s 0 300 44
efforts 0 300 44
to 0 300 44
get 0 300 44
our 1 300 44
European 0 300 44
allies 0 300 44
to 0 300 44
increase 0 300 44
their 0 300 44
defense 0 300 44
spending 0 300 44
has 0 300 44
a 0 300 44
direct 0 300 44
impact 0 300 44
on 0 300 44
Putin. 0 300 44

The 0 300 45
stronger 0 300 45
NATO 0 300 45
is, 0 300 45
the 0 300 45
less 0 300 45
maneuvering 0 300 45
room 0 300 45
Russia 0 300 45
has. 0 300 45

Beyond 0 300 46
pressuring 0 300 46
our 1 300 46
allies, 1 300 46
consider 0 300 46
these 0 300 46
specific 0 300 46
steps 0 300 46
President 0 300 46
Trump 0 300 46
has 0 300 46
taken 0 300 46
against 0 300 46
Russia: 0 300 46
Where 0 300 46
President 0 300 46
Obama 0 300 46
refused 0 300 46
to 0 300 46
provide 0 300 46
serious 0 300 46
weapons 0 300 46
to 0 300 46
the 0 300 46
Ukrainians 0 300 46
to 0 300 46
help 0 300 46
them 0 300 46
defend 0 300 46
themselves 0 300 46
(his 0 300 46
response 0 300 46
was 0 300 46
weakness 1 300 46
on 1 300 46
a 1 300 46
pathetic 1 300 46
scale), 1 300 46
President 0 300 46
Trump 0 300 46
has 0 300 46
approved 0 300 46
the 0 300 46
sale 0 300 46
of 0 300 46
offensive 0 300 46
weapons 0 300 46
to 0 300 46
enable 0 300 46
the 0 300 46
Ukrainians 0 300 46
to 0 300 46
increase 0 300 46
the 0 300 46
cost 0 300 46
of 0 300 46
Russian 0 300 46
aggression. 0 300 46

When 0 300 47
the 0 300 47
Russians 0 300 47
used 0 300 47
chemical 0 300 47
weapons 0 300 47
in 0 300 47
Great 0 300 47
Britain, 0 300 47
President 0 300 47
Trump 0 300 47
joined 0 300 47
our 1 300 47
allies 1 300 47
and 0 300 47
expelled 0 300 47
60 0 300 47
Russian 0 300 47
intelligence 0 300 47
officers 0 300 47
from 0 300 47
the 0 300 47
United 0 300 47
States. 0 300 47

When 0 300 48
the 0 300 48
Russians 0 300 48
retaliated, 0 300 48
the 1 300 48
Trump 1 300 48
administration 1 300 48
closed 0 300 48
the 0 300 48
Russian 0 300 48
consulate 0 300 48
in 0 300 48
Seattle. 0 300 48

President 0 300 49
Trump 0 300 49
had 0 300 49
previously 0 300 49
shuttered 0 300 49
the 0 300 49
Russian 0 300 49
consulate 0 300 49
in 0 300 49
San 0 300 49
Francisco 0 300 49
and 0 300 49
smaller 0 300 49
annexes 0 300 49
in 0 300 49
Washington 0 300 49
and 0 300 49
New 0 300 49
York. 0 300 49

More 0 300 50
than 0 300 50
100 0 300 50
Russian 0 300 50
individuals 0 300 50
and 0 300 50
companies 0 300 50
have 0 300 50
been 0 300 50
sanctioned 0 300 50
for 0 300 50
a 0 300 50
variety 0 300 50
of 0 300 50
reasons. 0 300 50

Despite 0 300 51
the 0 300 51
hysteria 1 300 51
of 0 300 51
the 0 300 51
left, 0 300 51
it 0 300 51
is 0 300 51
impossible 0 300 51
to 0 300 51
see 0 300 51
the 1 300 51
Trump 1 300 51
administration 1 300 51
as 0 300 51
anything 0 300 51
but 0 300 51
firm 0 300 51
in 0 300 51
its 0 300 51
dealing 0 300 51
with 0 300 51
Russia. 0 300 51

Nothing 0 300 52
done 0 300 52
in 0 300 52
Helsinki 0 300 52
made 0 300 52
life 0 300 52
easier 0 300 52
for 0 300 52
the 0 300 52
Putin 0 300 52
regime 0 300 52
in 0 300 52
its 0 300 52
continued 0 300 52
economic 0 300 52
decay 0 300 52
and 0 300 52
diplomatic 0 300 52
isolation 0 300 52
due 0 300 52
to 0 300 52
the 0 300 52

foreign 0 300 53

would 0 300 53

to 0 300 53

that 0 300 53
President 0 300 53
Trump 0 300 53
has 0 300 53
most 0 300 53
assuredly 0 300 53

tougher 1 300 53

According 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
Breitbart, 0 70 3
“Sellner, 0 70 3
who 0 70 3
described 0 70 3
the 0 70 3
detention 0 70 3

as 0 70 3
looking 0 70 3

a 0 70 3
typical 0 70 3
American 0 70 3

said 0 70 3
he 1 70 3
was 1 70 3
told 1 70 3

that 1 70 3
his 1 70 3

cause 1 70 3
violence 1 70 3
and 1 70 3
disrupt 1 70 3
community 1 70 3
cohesion.” 1 70 3

That’s 1 70 4
just 1 70 4
what 1 70 4
they 1 70 4
claimed 1 70 4
about 1 70 4

me: 1 70 4
that 1 70 4

community 1 70 4
cohesion. 1 70 4

But 0 70 5
we, 0 70 5
of 0 70 5
course, 0 70 5
have 0 70 5
never 0 70 5
advocated 0 70 5
or 0 70 5
approved 0 70 5
of 0 70 5
any 0 70 5
violence. 0 70 5

The 0 70 6
UK 0 70 6
Home 0 70 6
Office 0 70 6
meant 0 70 6
that 0 70 6
our 0 70 6

cause 0 70 6
violence 0 70 6
from 0 70 6

They 1 70 7
were 1 70 7

five 1 70 10
things. 1 70 10

One 1 70 11
– 1 70 11
the 1 70 11
easiest 1 70 11
one 1 70 11
maybe 1 70 11
– 1 70 11
chop 1 70 11
their 1 70 11
head 1 70 11
off, 1 70 11
that’s 1 70 11
the 1 70 11
easiest. 1 70 11

Second 1 70 12
– 1 70 12
burn 1 70 12
them 1 70 12
to 1 70 12
death. 1 70 12

Third 1 70 13
– 1 70 13
throw 1 70 13
’em 1 70 13
off 1 70 13
a 1 70 13
cliff. 1 70 13

Fourth 1 70 14
– 1 70 14
tear 1 70 14
down 1 70 14
a 1 70 14
wall 1 70 14
on 1 70 14
them 1 70 14
so 1 70 14
they 1 70 14
die 1 70 14
under 1 70 14
that. 1 70 14

Fifth 1 70 15
– 1 70 15
a 1 70 15
combination 1 70 15
of 1 70 15
the 1 70 15
above.” 1 70 15

I 0 191 3
had 0 191 3
to 0 191 3
say 0 191 3
about 0 191 3
it 0 191 3
would 0 191 3
not 0 191 3
be 0 191 3
in 0 191 3
keeping 0 191 3
with 0 191 3
his 0 191 3
editorial 0 191 3
policies. 0 191 3

It’s 0 191 4
been 0 191 4
five 0 191 4
years, 0 191 4
and 0 191 4
I’ve 0 191 4
noticed 0 191 4
that 0 191 4
there 0 191 4
are 0 191 4
a 0 191 4
lot 0 191 4
fewer 0 191 4
people 0 191 4
talking 0 191 4
about 0 191 4
what 0 191 4
a 0 191 4
“courageous” 0 191 4
act 0 191 4
it 0 191 4
was 0 191 4
to 0 191 4
give 0 191 4
up 0 191 4
the 0 191 4
pontificate. 0 191 4

The 0 191 5
consequences 0 191 5
of 0 191 5
that 0 191 5
act 0 191 5
have 0 191 5
been 0 191 5
so 1 191 5
outlandish 1 191 5
– 0 191 5
even 0 191 5
for 0 191 5
people 0 191 5
who 0 191 5
are 0 191 5
mostly 0 191 5
OK 0 191 5
with 0 191 5
Francis 0 191 5
– 0 191 5
that 0 191 5
very 0 191 5
few 0 191 5
people 0 191 5
are 0 191 5
still 0 191 5
willing 0 191 5
to 0 191 5
make 0 191 5
polite 0 191 5
noises 0 191 5
about 0 191 5
it. 0 191 5

for 0 191 7
Communications, 0 191 7
the 0 191 7
former 0 191 7
pope 0 191 7
reportedly 0 191 7
offers 0 191 7
an 0 191 7
impassioned 1 191 7
defense 1 191 7
of 0 191 7
Pope 0 191 7
Francis 0 191 7
against 0 191 7
the 0 191 7
claim 0 191 7
that 0 191 7

In 0 191 8
no 0 191 8
uncertain 0 191 8
terms, 0 191 8
this 0 191 8
letter, 0 191 8
bearing 0 191 8
Benedict's 0 191 8
signature, 0 191 8
affirms 0 191 8
that 0 191 8
“there 0 191 8
is 0 191 8
an 0 191 8
internal 0 191 8
continuity 0 191 8

Whether 0 191 8

actually 0 191 8
wrote 0 191 8
this 0 191 8
letter 0 191 8
or 0 191 8
not, 0 191 8
it 0 191 8

to 0 191 8
a 0 191 8

grave 1 191 8
questions 1 191 8
that 0 191 8

MJM 0 191 10

In 0 191 11
fact, 0 191 11
five 0 191 11
years 0 191 11
after 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
resignation 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
Pope 0 191 11
Benedict 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
Catholic 0 191 11
faithful 0 191 11
mostly 0 191 11
want 0 191 11
to 0 191 11
know 0 191 11
why; 0 191 11
why 0 191 11
would 0 191 11
a 0 191 11
pope 0 191 11
– 0 191 11
a 0 191 11
man 0 191 11
with 0 191 11
decades 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
up-close-and-personal 0 191 11
experience 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
“filth” 1 191 11
in 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
Curia 0 191 11
and 0 191 11
throughout 0 191 11
the 0 191 11
church 0 191 11
– 0 191 11
suddenly 0 191 11
just 0 191 11
decide 0 191 11
to 0 191 11
quit? 0 191 11

Why 0 191 12
would 0 191 12
he 0 191 12
choose 0 191 12
to 0 191 12
walk 0 191 12
away 0 191 12
knowing 0 191 12
that 0 191 12
his 0 191 12
task 0 191 12
was 0 191 12
not 0 191 12
completed? 0 191 12

At 0 191 13
the 0 191 13
time 0 191 13
and 0 191 13
since 0 191 13
then, 0 191 13
particularly 0 191 13
in 0 191 13
light 0 191 13
of 0 191 13
what 0 191 13
has 0 191 13
been 0 191 13
happening, 0 191 13
it 0 191 13
seems 0 191 13
one 1 191 13
of 1 191 13
the 1 191 13
most 1 191 13
bizarre 1 191 13
aspects 1 191 13
of 1 191 13
this 1 191 13
whole 1 191 13
bizarre 1 191 13
situation 1 191 13
that 0 191 13
the 0 191 13
reasons 0 191 13
offered 0 191 13
have 0 191 13
been 0 191 13
so 1 191 13
trivial, 1 191 13
so 1 191 13
inappropriately, 1 191 13
so 1 191 13
disproportionately 1 191 13
petty. 1 191 13

These 0 191 14
absurd 1 191 14
responses 1 191 14
to 1 191 14
serious 1 191 14
questions 1 191 14
of 1 191 14
grave 1 191 14
import 1 191 14
have 0 191 14
raised 0 191 14
the 0 191 14
inescapable 0 191 14
suspicion 0 191 14
that 0 191 14
Benedict 0 191 14
simply 0 191 14
did 0 191 14
not 0 191 14
take 0 191 14
the 0 191 14
papacy 0 191 14
as 0 191 14
seriously 0 191 14
as 0 191 14
the 0 191 14
rest 0 191 14
of 0 191 14
us 0 191 14
did. 0 191 14

We 0 191 15
cannot 0 191 15
help 0 191 15
but 0 191 15
wonder 0 191 15
if 0 191 15
these 0 191 15
trivialised 0 191 15
responses 0 191 15
reveal 0 191 15
some 0 191 15
deep 0 191 15
flaw 0 191 15
that 0 191 15
we 0 191 15
had 0 191 15
never 0 191 15
suspected 0 191 15
before. 0 191 15

Could 1 191 16
we 1 191 16
have 1 191 16
been 1 191 16
wrong 1 191 16
about 1 191 16
him? 1 191 16

And 1 191 17
if 1 191 17
so, 1 191 17
could 1 191 17
we 1 191 17
have 1 191 17
been 1 191 17
this 1 191 17
wrong? 1 191 17

For 0 191 18
reasons, 0 191 18
all 0 191 18
we 0 191 18
heard 0 191 18
at 0 191 18
the 0 191 18
time 0 191 18
was, 0 191 18
essentially, 0 191 18
“I’m 1 191 18
tired.” 1 191 18
There 0 191 18
was 0 191 18
some 0 191 18
implication 0 191 18
that 0 191 18
he 0 191 18
didn’t 0 191 18
feel 0 191 18
up 0 191 18
to 0 191 18
international 0 191 18
travel 0 191 18
anymore, 0 191 18
so 0 191 18
couldn’t 0 191 18
make 0 191 18
it 0 191 18
to 0 191 18
World 0 191 18
Youth 0 191 18
Day 0 191 18
and 0 191 18
similar 0 191 18
events. 0 191 18

The 0 191 19
trivialising 0 191 19
of 0 191 19
the 0 191 19
resignation 0 191 19
seemed 0 191 19
to 0 191 19
go 0 191 19
hand 0 191 19
in 0 191 19
hand 0 191 19
with 0 191 19
the 0 191 19
modern 0 191 19
concept 0 191 19
of 0 191 19
the 0 191 19
pope-as-pop-star, 1 191 19
something 0 191 19
we 0 191 19
had 0 191 19
thought 0 191 19
Benedict 0 191 19
was 0 191 19
too 0 191 19
serious 0 191 19
a 0 191 19
man, 0 191 19
too 0 191 19
serious 0 191 19
a 0 191 19
Catholic, 0 191 19
to 0 191 19
believe 0 191 19
himself. 0 191 19

Of 0 191 20
all 0 191 20
people, 0 191 20
we 0 191 20
had 0 191 20
assumed 0 191 20
that 0 191 20
Benedict 0 191 20
XVI 0 191 20
took 0 191 20
the 0 191 20
papacy 0 191 20
seriously. 0 191 20

And 0 191 21
since 0 191 21
then, 0 191 21
as 0 191 21
all 0 191 21
the 0 191 21
poisons 0 191 21
that 0 191 21
had 0 191 21
been 0 191 21
lurking 0 191 21
for 0 191 21
fifty 0 191 21
years 0 191 21
in 0 191 21
the 0 191 21
NewChurch 1 191 21
mud 1 191 21
are 0 191 21
busily 0 191 21
hatching 0 191 21
out, 0 191 21
many 0 191 21
Catholics 0 191 21
want 0 191 21
to 0 191 21
know 0 191 21
why 0 191 21
we 0 191 21
hear 0 191 21
nothing 0 191 21
from 0 191 21
him? 0 191 21

This 0 191 22
man 0 191 22
whom 0 191 22
we 0 191 22
had 0 191 22
believed 0 191 22
a 0 191 22
“champion 1 191 22
of 1 191 22
orthodoxy,” 1 191 22
whom 0 191 22
we 0 191 22
thought 0 191 22
we 0 191 22
knew. 0 191 22

Error, 0 191 23
even 0 191 23
heresy 1 191 23
and 1 191 23
blasphemy 1 191 23
are 0 191 23
pouring 0 191 23
daily 0 191 23
out 0 191 23
of 0 191 23
the 0 191 23
mouth 0 191 23
of 0 191 23
his 0 191 23
successor, 0 191 23
who 0 191 23
has, 0 191 23
literally, 0 191 23
turned 1 191 23
the 1 191 23
Vatican 1 191 23
into 1 191 23
a 1 191 23
den 1 191 23
of 1 191 23
thieves, 1 191 23
and 0 191 23
we 0 191 23
hear 0 191 23
nothing 0 191 23
but 0 191 23
the 0 191 23
occasional, 0 191 23
carefully 0 191 23
worded 0 191 23
statement 0 191 23
on 0 191 23
how 0 191 23
fine 0 191 23
everything 0 191 23
is. 0 191 23

How 0 191 24
content 0 191 24
he 0 191 24
is 0 191 24
with 0 191 24
his 0 191 24
decision 0 191 24
and 0 191 24
how 0 191 24
happy 0 191 24
with 0 191 24
his 0 191 24
current 0 191 24
life. 0 191 24

After 0 191 25
three 0 191 25
years 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
systematic 0 191 25
dismantling 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
everything 0 191 25
he 0 191 25
had 0 191 25
attempted 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
do 0 191 25
in 0 191 25
his 0 191 25
pontificate, 0 191 25
we 0 191 25
got 0 191 25
this 0 191 25
from 0 191 25
an 0 191 25
apparently 0 191 25
utterly 1 191 25
insouciant 1 191 25
Ratzinger, 0 191 25
addressed 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
Francis: 0 191 25
“Your 0 191 25
goodness 0 191 25
is 0 191 25
my 0 191 25
home 0 191 25
and 0 191 25
the 0 191 25
place 0 191 25
where 0 191 25
I 0 191 25
feel 0 191 25
safe.” 0 191 25
Everyone 0 191 25
who 0 191 25
had 0 191 25
ever 0 191 25
read 0 191 25
anything 0 191 25
he 0 191 25
had 0 191 25
written 0 191 25
were 0 191 25
amazed 0 191 25
he 0 191 25
was 0 191 25
capable 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
producing 0 191 25
such 0 191 25
maudlin 0 191 25
drivel, 0 191 25
but 0 191 25
the 0 191 25
video 0 191 25
doesn’t 0 191 25
lie: 0 191 25

So 0 191 26
strange 0 191 26
was 0 191 26
this 0 191 26
new 0 191 26
tone 0 191 26
that 0 191 26
speculation 0 191 26
started 0 191 26
circulating 0 191 26
that 0 191 26
he 0 191 26
was 0 191 26
under 0 191 26
some 0 191 26
kind 0 191 26
of 0 191 26
external 0 191 26
compulsion, 0 191 26
not 0 191 26
free 0 191 26
to 0 191 26
speak 0 191 26
his 0 191 26
mind. 0 191 26

But 0 191 27
this 0 191 27
is 0 191 27
not 0 191 27
what 0 191 27
we 0 191 27
see. 0 191 27

There 0 191 28
he 0 191 28
is, 0 191 28
manifestly 0 191 28
happy 0 191 28
and 0 191 28
reading 0 191 28
it 0 191 28
out 0 191 28
loud. 0 191 28

“Perhaps 0 191 29
it 0 191 29
was 0 191 29
written 0 191 29
for 0 191 29
him.” 0 191 29
Well, 0 191 29
why 0 191 29
repeat 0 191 29
it 0 191 29
then? 0 191 29

Why, 0 191 30
if 0 191 30
he 0 191 30
has 0 191 30
any 0 191 30
qualms, 0 191 30
allow 0 191 30
himself 0 191 30
to 0 191 30
be 0 191 30
trotted 0 191 30
out 0 191 30
on 0 191 30
such 0 191 30
occasions, 0 191 30
to 0 191 30
read 0 191 30
this 0 191 30
blatant 0 191 30
propaganda? 0 191 30

If 0 191 31
it 0 191 31
is 0 191 31
a 0 191 31
deception, 0 191 31
why 0 191 31
participate 0 191 31
in 0 191 31
it? 0 191 31

In 0 191 32
fact, 0 191 32
all 0 191 32
the 0 191 32
hopeful 0 191 32
commenters 0 191 32
on 0 191 32
blogs 0 191 32
and 0 191 32
other 0 191 32
social 0 191 32
media 0 191 32
who 0 191 32
keep 0 191 32
telling 0 191 32
me 0 191 32
how 0 191 32
much 0 191 32
they 0 191 32
“miss” 0 191 32
him 0 191 32
have 0 191 32
failed 0 191 32
to 0 191 32
respect 0 191 32
him 0 191 32
in 0 191 32
one 0 191 32
way; 0 191 32
they 0 191 32
won’t 0 191 32
take 0 191 32
him 0 191 32
at 0 191 32
his 0 191 32
word. 0 191 32

Some 0 191 33
insist 0 191 33
that 0 191 33
his 0 191 33
resignation 0 191 33
was 0 191 33
under 0 191 33
some 0 191 33
sort 0 191 33
of 0 191 33
coercion 0 191 33
and 0 191 33
so 0 191 33
isn’t 0 191 33
valid. 0 191 33

But 0 191 34
we 0 191 34
have 0 191 34
repeatedly 0 191 34
heard 0 191 34
from 0 191 34
him 0 191 34
that 0 191 34
he 0 191 34
was 0 191 34
under 0 191 34
no 0 191 34
constraint, 0 191 34
that 0 191 34
he 0 191 34
had 0 191 34
resigned 0 191 34
freely. 0 191 34

And 0 191 35
indeed, 0 191 35
far 0 191 35
from 0 191 35
being 0 191 35
an 0 191 35
isolated 0 191 35
“prisoner 1 191 35
of 1 191 35
the 1 191 35
Vatican,” 1 191 35
Benedict 0 191 35
has 0 191 35
received 0 191 35
many 0 191 35
guests 0 191 35
all 0 191 35
of 0 191 35
whom 0 191 35
report 0 191 35
that, 0 191 35
though 0 191 35
frail, 0 191 35
he 0 191 35
appears 0 191 35
content 0 191 35
and 0 191 35
never 0 191 35
utters 0 191 35
a 0 191 35
word 0 191 35
of 0 191 35
criticism. 0 191 35

We 0 191 36
have 0 191 36
yet 0 191 36
to 0 191 36
hear 0 191 36
any 0 191 36
report 0 191 36
of 0 191 36
any 0 191 36
notes 0 191 36
begging 0 191 36
for 0 191 36
rescue 0 191 36
hidden 0 191 36
under 0 191 36
a 0 191 36
lunch 0 191 36
table 0 191 36
placemat. 0 191 36

There’s 0 191 37
no 0 191 37
doubt 0 191 37
that 0 191 37
this 0 191 37
is 0 191 37
an 0 191 37
extremely 0 191 37
strange 0 191 37
and 0 191 37
frankly 0 191 37
fishy 0 191 37
situation; 0 191 37
something 0 191 37
doesn’t 0 191 37
add 0 191 37
up, 0 191 37
it’s 0 191 37
true. 0 191 37

All 0 191 38
the 0 191 38
questions 0 191 38
have 0 191 38
gone 0 191 38
ignored, 0 191 38
or 0 191 38
have 0 191 38
received 0 191 38
frivolous, 1 191 38
jokey 1 191 38
responses: 1 191 38

Why 0 191 39
did 0 191 39
you 0 191 39
resign? 0 191 39

Ratzinger: 0 191 40
“I 0 191 40
was 0 191 40
a 0 191 40
bit 0 191 40
tired 0 191 40
and 0 191 40
didn’t 0 191 40
feel 0 191 40
up 0 191 40
to 0 191 40
partying 0 191 40
with 0 191 40
the 0 191 40
kids 0 191 40
at 0 191 40
World 0 191 40
Youth 0 191 40
Day.” 0 191 40

If 0 191 41
you’re 0 191 41
not 0 191 41
pope, 0 191 41
why 0 191 41
do 0 191 41
you 0 191 41
still 0 191 41
wear 0 191 41
the 0 191 41
white? 0 191 41

Ratzinger: 0 191 42
“Oh, 0 191 42
there 0 191 42
wasn’t 0 191 42
a 0 191 42
black 0 191 42
cassock 0 191 42
that 0 191 42
fit 0 191 42
me.” 0 191 42

Why 0 191 43
do 0 191 43
you 0 191 43
continue 0 191 43
to 0 191 43
call 0 191 43
yourself 0 191 43
Benedict 0 191 43
XVI 0 191 43
if 0 191 43
you 0 191 43
are 0 191 43
no 0 191 43
longer 0 191 43
pope? 0 191 43

Ratzinger: 0 191 44
“Well, 0 191 44
I’m 0 191 44
an 0 191 44
‘emeritus,’ 0 191 44
you 0 191 44
see…” 0 191 44

And 0 191 45
where 0 191 45
did 0 191 45
this 0 191 45
“emeritus” 0 191 45
business 0 191 45
come 0 191 45
from? 0 191 45

Does 0 191 46
it 0 191 46
have 0 191 46
any 0 191 46
precedent 0 191 46
in 0 191 46
Catholic 0 191 46
history? 0 191 46

What 0 191 47
does 0 191 47
it 0 191 47
mean 0 191 47
canonically 0 191 47
and 0 191 47
doctrinally? 0 191 47

Ratzinger: 0 191 48
“…” 0 191 48

What 0 191 49
was 0 191 49
all 1 191 49
that 1 191 49
rubbish 1 191 49
from 0 191 49
Ganswein 0 191 49
about 0 191 49
there 0 191 49
being 0 191 49
a 0 191 49
divided 0 191 49
“munus” 0 191 49
– 0 191 49
with 0 191 49
an 0 191 49
active 0 191 49
member 0 191 49
and 0 191 49
a 0 191 49
“contemplative 0 191 49
member”? 0 191 49

Doesn’t 0 191 50
that 0 191 50
just 0 191 50
mean 0 191 50
there 0 191 50
are 0 191 50
two 0 191 50
popes 0 191 50
now? 0 191 50

Ratzinger: 0 191 51
“…” 0 191 51

And 0 191 52
perhaps 0 191 52
most 0 191 52
agonising 0 191 52
of 0 191 52
all: 0 191 52
“How 1 191 52
can 1 191 52
you 1 191 52
just 1 191 52
sit 1 191 52
there 1 191 52
smiling, 1 191 52
issuing 1 191 52
bland 1 191 52
platitudinous 1 191 52
nonsense, 1 191 52
while 1 191 52
this 1 191 52
lunatic 1 191 52
drives 1 191 52
the 1 191 52
sheep 1 191 52
off 1 191 52
a 1 191 52
cliff?” 1 191 52

A 0 191 53
few 0 191 53
days 0 191 53
ago, 0 191 53
my 0 191 53
friend 0 191 53
Steve 0 191 53
Skojec, 0 191 53
of 0 191 53
the 0 191 53
traditionalist/restorationist 0 191 53
website 0 191 53
One 0 191 53
Peter 0 191 53
Five, 0 191 53
summed 0 191 53
up 0 191 53
the 0 191 53
consternation 0 191 53
of 0 191 53
those 0 191 53
of 0 191 53
us 0 191 53
who 0 191 53
still 0 191 53
feel 0 191 53
a 0 191 53
lingering 0 191 53
affection 0 191 53
for 0 191 53
(the 0 191 53
man 0 191 53
we 0 191 53
used 0 191 53
to 0 191 53
call) 0 191 53
Pope 0 191 53
Benedict. 0 191 53

Steve 0 191 54
summons 0 191 54
up 0 191 54
in 0 191 54
this 0 191 54
brief 0 191 54
post 0 191 54
all 0 191 54
the 0 191 54
anger 0 191 54
and 0 191 54
all 0 191 54
the 0 191 54
crushing 1 191 54
disappointment 1 191 54
most 0 191 54
of 0 191 54
us 0 191 54
probably 0 191 54
still 0 191 54
feel 0 191 54
reluctant 0 191 54
to 0 191 54
express 0 191 54
out 0 191 54
loud: 0 191 54

Five 0 191 55
years 0 191 55
ago 0 191 55
today, 0 191 55
Pope 0 191 55
Benedict 0 191 55
XVI 0 191 55
abdicated 0 191 55
the 0 191 55
papacy. 0 191 55

And 0 191 56
through 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
abandonment 0 191 56
of 0 191 56
his 0 191 56
duty 0 191 56
to 0 191 56
shepherd 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
Church, 0 191 56
he 0 191 56
made 0 191 56
way 0 191 56
for 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
worst 0 191 56
papacy 0 191 56
of 0 191 56
all 0 191 56
time 0 191 56
– 0 191 56
one 0 191 56
he 0 191 56
steadfastly 0 191 56
refuses 0 191 56
to 0 191 56
oppose 0 191 56
in 0 191 56
word, 0 191 56
deed, 0 191 56
or 0 191 56
even 0 191 56
the 0 191 56
subtlest 0 191 56
gesture. 0 191 56

You 0 191 57
may 0 191 57
love 0 191 57
him 0 191 57
for 0 191 57
various 0 191 57
reasons, 0 191 57
you 0 191 57
may 0 191 57
miss 0 191 57
him 0 191 57
by 0 191 57
contrast, 0 191 57
but 0 191 57
you 0 191 57
may 0 191 57
not 0 191 57
excuse 0 191 57
the 0 191 57
responsibility 0 191 57
he 0 191 57
has. 0 191 57

He 0 191 58
walked 0 191 58
away 0 191 58
from 0 191 58
his 0 191 58
family, 0 191 58
leaving 0 191 58
the 0 191 58
door 0 191 58
open 0 191 58
to 0 191 58
an 0 191 58
abusive 1 191 58
stepfather, 1 191 58
and 0 191 58
he 0 191 58
watches 1 191 58
his 1 191 58
children 1 191 58
beaten 1 191 58
and 1 191 58
led 1 191 58
astray 1 191 58
not 0 191 58
just 0 191 58
in 0 191 58
silence, 0 191 58
but 0 191 58
in 0 191 58
apparent 0 191 58
contentment. 0 191 58

And 0 191 59
still, 0 191 59
he 0 191 59
was 0 191 59
the 0 191 59
best 0 191 59
of 0 191 59
the 0 191 59
post-conciliar 0 191 59
popes, 0 191 59
which 0 191 59
is 0 191 59
why 0 191 59
he’s 0 191 59
the 0 191 59
only 0 191 59
one 0 191 59
who 0 191 59
won’t 0 191 59
be 0 191 59
canonized. 0 191 59

Who 0 191 60
is 0 191 60
the 0 191 60
real 0 191 60
Joseph 0 191 60
Ratzinger? 0 191 60

I 0 191 61
have 0 191 61
had 0 191 61
long-time 0 191 61
Vatican 0 191 61
watchers 0 191 61
say 0 191 61
to 0 191 61
me, 0 191 61
more 0 191 61
than 0 191 61
once, 0 191 61
“Maybe 0 191 61
it’s 0 191 61
really 0 191 61
just 0 191 61
that 0 191 61
he 0 191 61
wasn’t 0 191 61
who 0 191 61
we 0 191 61
thought 0 191 61
he 0 191 61
was.” 0 191 61
I 0 191 61
suspect 0 191 61
there 0 191 61
is 0 191 61
a 0 191 61
lot 0 191 61
more 0 191 61
to 0 191 61
this 0 191 61
than 0 191 61
most 0 191 61
people 0 191 61
might 0 191 61
imagine. 0 191 61

I 0 191 62
think 0 191 62
we 0 191 62
made 0 191 62
the 0 191 62
mistake 0 191 62
of 0 191 62
believing 0 191 62
the 0 191 62
press. 0 191 62

We 0 191 63
were 0 191 63
delighted 0 191 63
that 0 191 63
the 0 191 63
bitterly 1 191 63
anti-Catholic 1 191 63
media 1 191 63
hated 0 191 63
and 0 191 63
feared 0 191 63
him. 0 191 63

We 0 191 64
failed 0 191 64
to 0 191 64
recall 0 191 64
that 0 191 64
they 0 191 64
know 0 191 64
nothing 0 191 64
at 0 191 64
all 0 191 64
about 0 191 64
Catholicism. 0 191 64

What 0 191 65
the 0 191 65
papers 0 191 65
never 0 191 65
told 0 191 65
us 0 191 65
was 0 191 65
that 0 191 65
as 0 191 65
a 0 191 65
young 0 191 65
priest 0 191 65
and 0 191 65
theologian 0 191 65
Joseph 0 191 65
Ratzinger 0 191 65
was 1 191 65
known 1 191 65
as 1 191 65
a 1 191 65
“progressive,” 1 191 65
as 0 191 65
the 0 191 65
term 0 191 65
was 0 191 65
understood 0 191 65
in 0 191 65
1962. 0 191 65

This 0 191 66
reputation 0 191 66
was 0 191 66
cemented 0 191 66
during 0 191 66
his 0 191 66
work 0 191 66
as 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
peritus, 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
theological 0 191 66
advisor, 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
one 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
Council’s 0 191 66
most 0 191 66
influential 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
bishops 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
the 0 191 66
progressive 0 191 66
camp, 0 191 66
Cardinal 0 191 66
Josef 0 191 66
Frings 0 191 66
of 0 191 66
Cologne. 0 191 66

Frings’ 0 191 67
claim 0 191 67
to 0 191 67
fame 0 191 67
in 0 191 67
that 0 191 67
great 0 191 67
drama 0 191 67
was 0 191 67
a 0 191 67
speech 0 191 67
criticising 0 191 67

guiding 0 191 67
the 0 191 67
bishops’ 0 191 67
discussions. 0 191 67

After 0 191 68
this 0 191 68
speech, 0 191 68
there 0 191 68
was 0 191 68
an 0 191 68
uprising 0 191 68
among 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
bishops 0 191 68
of 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
preparatory 0 191 68
committee 0 191 68
who 0 191 68
demanded 0 191 68
that 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
schema 0 191 68
– 0 191 68
that 0 191 68
had 0 191 68
taken 0 191 68
years 0 191 68
to 0 191 68
develop 0 191 68
– 0 191 68
be 0 191 68
abandoned. 0 191 68

This 0 191 69
was 0 191 69
done, 0 191 69
over 0 191 69
Ottaviani’s 0 191 69
futile 1 191 69
objections, 1 191 69
and 0 191 69
new 0 191 69
documents 0 191 69
were 0 191 69
rapidly 0 191 69
cobbled 0 191 69
together 0 191 69
by 0 191 69
a 0 191 69
coalition 0 191 69
of 0 191 69
German 0 191 69
and 0 191 69
French 0 191 69
“progressives” 1 191 69
who 0 191 69
rejoiced 0 191 69
that 0 191 69
they 0 191 69
had, 0 191 69
in 0 191 69
effect, 0 191 69
seized 0 191 69
control 0 191 69
of 0 191 69
the 0 191 69
Council 0 191 69
from 0 191 69
that 0 191 69
moment, 0 191 69
before 0 191 69
it 0 191 69
had 0 191 69
even 0 191 69
started. 0 191 69

It 0 191 70
has 0 191 70
since 0 191 70
been 0 191 70
revealed 0 191 70
that 0 191 70
it 0 191 70
was 0 191 70
Joseph 0 191 70
Ratzinger 0 191 70
– 0 191 70
the 0 191 70
maverick 0 191 70
“progressive” 1 191 70
academic 1 191 70
theologian 1 191 70
Frings 1 191 70
had 0 191 70
brought 0 191 70
to 0 191 70
Rome 0 191 70
as 0 191 70
his 0 191 70
secretary 0 191 70
– 0 191 70
who 0 191 70
wrote 0 191 70
that 0 191 70
speech. 0 191 70

Cardinal 0 191 71
Henri 0 191 71
de 0 191 71
Lubac, 0 191 71
writing 0 191 71
in 0 191 71
1985, 0 191 71
recalling 0 191 71
that 0 191 71
drama, 0 191 71
said: 0 191 71

“Joseph 0 191 72
Ratzinger, 0 191 72
an 0 191 72
expert 0 191 72
at 0 191 72
the 0 191 72
Council, 0 191 72
was 0 191 72
also 0 191 72
the 0 191 72
private 0 191 72

Blind, 0 191 74
the 0 191 74
old 0 191 74
Cardinal 0 191 74
largely 0 191 74
utilized 0 191 74
his 0 191 74
secretary 0 191 74
to 0 191 74
write 0 191 74
his 0 191 74
interventions. 0 191 74

Now 0 191 75
then, 0 191 75
one 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
these 0 191 75
interventions 0 191 75
became 0 191 75
memorable: 0 191 75
it 0 191 75
was 0 191 75
a 0 191 75
radical 0 191 75
criticism 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
the 0 191 75
methods 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
the 0 191 75
Holy 0 191 75
Office. 0 191 75

Despite 0 191 76
a 0 191 76
reply 0 191 76
by 0 191 76
Card. 0 191 76

Ottaviani, 0 191 77
Frings 0 191 77
sustained 0 191 77
his 0 191 77
critique. 0 191 77

“It 0 191 78
is 0 191 78
not 0 191 78
an 0 191 78

itself 0 191 78
then, 0 191 78
was 0 191 78

by 0 191 78
Ratzinger 0 191 78
in 0 191 78

“Card. 0 191 79

man 1 191 80
full 1 191 80

Ratzinger, 0 191 81
who 0 191 81
did 0 191 81
not 0 191 81
change, 0 191 81
continues 0 191 81
it.” 0 191 81

Ratzinger’s 0 191 82
reputation 0 191 82
as 0 191 82
a 0 191 82
“progressive” 1 191 82
is 0 191 82
not 0 191 82
based 0 191 82
on 0 191 82
one 0 191 82
incident, 0 191 82
nor 0 191 82
was 0 191 82
it 0 191 82
restricted 0 191 82
to 0 191 82
his 0 191 82
early 0 191 82
work. 0 191 82

It 0 191 83
went 0 191 83
unnoticed 0 191 83
in 0 191 83
the 0 191 83
shouting 0 191 83
over 0 191 83
his 0 191 83
running 0 191 83
of 0 191 83
CDF, 0 191 83
that 0 191 83
he 0 191 83
had 0 191 83
written 0 191 83
in 0 191 83
1982, 0 191 83
a 0 191 83
call 0 191 83
for 0 191 83
the 0 191 83
Church 0 191 83
“never 0 191 83
to 0 191 83
return” 0 191 83
to 0 191 83
the 0 191 83
Syllabus 0 191 83
of 0 191 83
Errors 0 191 83
of 0 191 83
Pius 0 191 83
IX. 0 191 83

In 0 191 84
his 0 191 84
book 0 191 84
Principles 0 191 84
of 0 191 84
Catholic 0 191 84
Theology, 0 191 84
Ratzinger 0 191 84
proposed 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
question, 0 191 84
“Should 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
Council 0 191 84
be 0 191 84
revoked?” 0 191 84
and 0 191 84
in 0 191 84
response 0 191 84
recommended 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
“razing 0 191 84
of 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
bastions” 0 191 84
of 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
Catholic 0 191 84
Church 0 191 84
in 0 191 84
relation 0 191 84
to 0 191 84
the 0 191 84
modern 0 191 84
world: 0 191 84

The 0 191 85
duty 0 191 85
is, 0 191 85
therefore, 0 191 85
not 0 191 85
to 0 191 85
suppress 0 191 85
the 0 191 85
Council, 0 191 85
but 0 191 85
to 0 191 85
discover 0 191 85
the 0 191 85
real 0 191 85
Council 0 191 85
and 0 191 85
delve 0 191 85
deep 0 191 85
into 0 191 85
what 0 191 85
it 0 191 85
truly 0 191 85
wants 0 191 85
with 0 191 85
regard 0 191 85
to 0 191 85
what 0 191 85
has 0 191 85
happened 0 191 85
since 0 191 85
then. 0 191 85

This 0 191 86
implies 0 191 86
that 0 191 86
there 0 191 86
is 0 191 86
no 0 191 86
possible 0 191 86
return 0 191 86
to 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
Syllabus, 0 191 86
which 0 191 86
could 0 191 86
well 0 191 86
have 0 191 86
been 0 191 86
a 0 191 86
first 0 191 86
step 0 191 86
in 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
combat 0 191 86
against 0 191 86
Liberalism 0 191 86
and 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
nascent 0 191 86
Marxism, 0 191 86
but 0 191 86
which 0 191 86
cannot 0 191 86
be 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
last 0 191 86
word. 0 191 86

Neither 0 191 87
embraces 0 191 87
nor 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
ghetto 0 191 87
can 0 191 87
resolve 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
problem 0 191 87
of 0 191 87
[relations 0 191 87
with] 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
modern 0 191 87
world 0 191 87
for 0 191 87
the 0 191 87
Christian. 0 191 87

Hence, 0 191 88
the 0 191 88
'razing 0 191 88
of 0 191 88
the 0 191 88
bastions' 0 191 88
that 0 191 88
Hans 0 191 88
Urs 0 191 88
von 0 191 88
Balthasar 0 191 88
called 0 191 88
for 0 191 88
already 0 191 88
in 0 191 88
1952 0 191 88
was 0 191 88
in 0 191 88
effect 0 191 88
an 0 191 88
urgent 0 191 88
duty. 0 191 88

It 0 191 89
was 0 191 89
necessary 0 191 89
for 0 191 89
her 0 191 89
[the 0 191 89
Church] 0 191 89
to 0 191 89
raze 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
old 0 191 89
bastions 0 191 89
and 0 191 89
confide 0 191 89
only 0 191 89
in 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
protection 0 191 89
of 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
faith, 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
power 0 191 89
of 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
word 0 191 89
that 0 191 89
is 0 191 89
her 0 191 89
unique, 0 191 89
true, 0 191 89
and 0 191 89
permanent 0 191 89
strength. 0 191 89

But 0 191 90
to 0 191 90
raze 0 191 90
the 0 191 90
bastions 0 191 90
cannot 0 191 90
signify 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
she 0 191 90
no 0 191 90
longer 0 191 90
has 0 191 90
anything 0 191 90
to 0 191 90
protect, 0 191 90
or 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
she 0 191 90
can 0 191 90
live 0 191 90
owing 0 191 90
to 0 191 90
different 0 191 90
forces 0 191 90
than 0 191 90
those 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
engendered 0 191 90
her: 0 191 90
the 1 191 90
water 1 191 90
and 1 191 90
the 1 191 90
blood 1 191 90
that 1 191 90
poured 1 191 90
from 1 191 90
the 1 191 90
open 1 191 90
side 1 191 90
of 1 191 90
her 1 191 90
crucified 1 191 90
Lord. 1 191 90

His 0 191 91
was 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
thesis 0 191 91
– 0 191 91
a 0 191 91
mainstay 0 191 91
of 0 191 91
“conservative” 0 191 91
ideology 0 191 91
– 0 191 91
that 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
“real” 0 191 91
Council, 0 191 91
if 0 191 91
only 0 191 91
implemented 0 191 91
properly, 0 191 91
would 0 191 91
be 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
salvation 0 191 91
of 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
Church 0 191 91
and 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
world, 0 191 91
a 0 191 91
theme 0 191 91
he 0 191 91
never 0 191 91
left. 0 191 91

How 0 191 92
ironic 0 191 92
it 0 191 92
must 0 191 92
have 0 191 92
seemed 0 191 92
to 0 191 92
those 0 191 92
who 0 191 92
remembered 0 191 92
this 0 191 92
history 0 191 92
that 0 191 92
Ratzinger 0 191 92
would 0 191 92
himself 0 191 92
be 0 191 92
given 0 191 92
the 0 191 92
office 0 191 92
he 0 191 92
had 0 191 92
“destroyed” 0 191 92
and 0 191 92
would 0 191 92
gain 0 191 92
the 0 191 92
media-generated 0 191 92
reputation 0 191 92
as 0 191 92
an 0 191 92
“arch-conservative”. 1 191 92

And 0 191 93
it 0 191 93
starts 0 191 93
to 0 191 93
suggest 0 191 93
an 0 191 93
answer, 0 191 93
or 0 191 93
at 0 191 93
least 0 191 93
a 0 191 93
line 0 191 93
of 0 191 93
inquiry, 0 191 93
about 0 191 93
why 0 191 93
so 0 191 93
little 0 191 93
was 0 191 93
actually 0 191 93
accomplished 0 191 93
in 0 191 93
his 0 191 93
long 0 191 93
tenure. 0 191 93

With 0 191 94
the 0 191 94
“arch-conservative” 1 191 94
“Rottweiler” 1 191 94
Ratzinger 1 191 94
in 0 191 94
CDF, 0 191 94
why 0 191 94
do 0 191 94
we 0 191 94
have 0 191 94
the 0 191 94
situation 0 191 94
we 0 191 94
have 0 191 94
today? 0 191 94

What 0 191 95
did 0 191 95
he 0 191 95
do 0 191 95
to 0 191 95
stop 0 191 95
the 0 191 95
explosion 0 191 95
of 0 191 95
neo-modernism 0 191 95
– 0 191 95
that 0 191 95
burned 1 191 95
like 1 191 95
an 1 191 95
unchecked 1 191 95
wildfire 1 191 95
throughout 1 191 95
the 1 191 95

did 0 191 96
“silencing” 0 191 96
by 0 191 96

by 0 191 96

we 0 191 98
think 0 191 98
of 0 191 98
any 0 191 98
other 0 191 98
names 0 191 98
who 0 191 98
were 0 191 98
corrected 0 191 98
even 0 191 98
to 0 191 98
this 0 191 98
degree? 0 191 98

Precious 0 191 99
few. 0 191 99

But 0 191 100
we 0 191 100
can 0 191 100
certainly 0 191 100
think 0 191 100
of 0 191 100
many, 0 191 100
many 0 191 100
who 0 191 100
spent 0 191 100
their 0 191 100
lives 0 191 100
and 0 191 100
vocations 0 191 100
blatantly 1 191 100
denying 1 191 100
and 1 191 100
undermining 1 191 100
the 0 191 100
Catholic 0 191 100
Faith 0 191 100
– 0 191 100
academic 0 191 100
theologians, 0 191 100
religious, 0 191 100
priests, 0 191 100
bishops 0 191 100
and 0 191 100
cardinals 0 191 100
around 0 191 100
the 0 191 100
world 0 191 100
– 0 191 100
with 0 191 100
never 0 191 100
a 0 191 100
peep 0 191 100
of 0 191 100
protest 0 191 100
from 0 191 100
Rome. 0 191 100

Moreover, 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
scandalous 0 191 101
pack 0 191 101
of 0 191 101
frauds 0 191 101
we 0 191 101
currently 0 191 101
have 0 191 101
in 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
episcopate 0 191 101
is 0 191 101
entirely 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
product 0 191 101
of 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
“arch-conservative” 1 191 101
John 0 191 101
Paul 0 191 101
II 0 191 101
and 0 191 101
the 0 191 101
“Rottweiler” 1 191 101
Benedict 1 191 101
XVI 1 191 101
pontificates. 0 191 101

Why 0 191 102
did 0 191 102
we 0 191 102
think 0 191 102
that 0 191 102
Ratzinger, 0 191 102
in 0 191 102
this 0 191 102
crucial 0 191 102
role 0 191 102
of 0 191 102
CDF 0 191 102
prefect, 0 191 102
was 0 191 102
a 0 191 102
bulwark 0 191 102
of 0 191 102
orthodoxy? 0 191 102

Is 0 191 103
it 0 191 103
simply 0 191 103
that 0 191 103
we 0 191 103
have 0 191 103
moved 0 191 103
so 0 191 103
far 0 191 103
away 0 191 103
from 0 191 103
the 0 191 103
ancient 0 191 103
Faith 0 191 103
that 0 191 103
we 0 191 103
no 0 191 103
longer 0 191 103
have 0 191 103
a 0 191 103
realistic 0 191 103
notion 0 191 103
of 0 191 103
the 0 191 103
Faith 0 191 103
ourselves 0 191 103
to 0 191 103
make 0 191 103
a 0 191 103
comparison, 0 191 103
to 0 191 103
make 0 191 103
an 0 191 103
objective 0 191 103
judgement? 0 191 103

The 0 191 104
“progressive” 1 191 104
destroyer 1 191 104
of 1 191 104
Ottaviani 1 191 104
inheriting 0 191 104
his 0 191 104
office 0 191 104
and 0 191 104
the 0 191 104
epithet 0 191 104
“arch-conservative”… 1 191 104

Indeed, 0 191 105
Ratzinger 0 191 105
himself 0 191 105
maintained 0 191 105
that 0 191 105
he 0 191 105
had 0 191 105
never 0 191 105
changed 0 191 105
his 0 191 105
theological 0 191 105
opinions. 0 191 105

He 0 191 106
was 0 191 106
to 0 191 106
say 0 191 106
that 0 191 106
it 0 191 106
was 0 191 106
his 0 191 106
old 0 191 106
academic 0 191 106
colleagues 0 191 106
like 0 191 106
Kung 0 191 106
and 0 191 106
Kasper 0 191 106
who 0 191 106
had 0 191 106
moved 0 191 106
further 0 191 106
to 0 191 106
the 0 191 106
ideological 0 191 106
“left” 0 191 106
after 0 191 106
the 0 191 106
1960s 0 191 106
while 0 191 106
he 0 191 106
stayed 0 191 106
in 0 191 106
place. 0 191 106

Perhaps 0 191 107
now, 0 191 107
as 0 191 107
an 0 191 107
answer 0 191 107
that 0 191 107
fits 0 191 107
our 0 191 107
apparently 0 191 107
contradictory 0 191 107
puzzle 0 191 107
pieces, 0 191 107
we 0 191 107
can 0 191 107
finally 0 191 107
accept 0 191 107
his 0 191 107
word 0 191 107
on 0 191 107
this. 0 191 107

Perhaps 0 191 108
the 0 191 108
world 0 191 108
of 0 191 108
Catholic 0 191 108
academic 0 191 108
theology 0 191 108
had 0 191 108
become 0 191 108
so 0 191 108
corrupted 0 191 108
that 0 191 108
a 1 191 108
man 1 191 108
called 1 191 108
“progressive” 1 191 108
in 0 191 108
1963, 0 191 108
but 0 191 108
whose 0 191 108
ideas 0 191 108
remained 0 191 108
the 0 191 108
same, 0 191 108
would 0 191 108
look 0 191 108
like 0 191 108
a 0 191 108
“champion 0 191 108
of 0 191 108
traditional 0 191 108
Catholic 0 191 108
orthodoxy” 0 191 108
by 0 191 108
2005. 0 191 108

Is 0 191 109
this 0 191 109
why 0 191 109
he 0 191 109
resigned? 0 191 109

Is 0 191 110
it 0 191 110
simply 0 191 110
that 0 191 110
his 0 191 110
conception 0 191 110
of 0 191 110
the 0 191 110
Church, 0 191 110
of 0 191 110
the 0 191 110
papacy, 0 191 110
was 0 191 110
never 0 191 110
what 0 191 110
Catholics 0 191 110
believed 0 191 110
about 0 191 110

it? 0 191 111
Perhaps 0 191 111
a 0 191 111
hint 0 191 111
at 0 191 111
the 0 191 111
answer 0 191 111
comes 0 191 111
from 0 191 111
La 0 191 111
Stampa 0 191 111
in 0 191 111
2015 0 191 111
which 0 191 111
published 0 191 111
some 0 191 111
of 0 191 111
the 0 191 111

of 0 191 111
Silvano 0 191 111

who 0 191 111

of 0 191 111
Cardinal 0 191 111
Carlo 0 191 111
Maria 0 191 111
Martini, 0 191 111
the 0 191 111
godfather 1 191 111
of 1 191 111
the 1 191 111

Catholic 1 191 111
Church, 1 191 111

the 0 191 111
“Sankt 0 191 111

that 0 191 111
Cardinal 0 191 111
Danneels 0 191 111
admitted 0 191 111
conspired 0 191 111
for 0 191 111
years 0 191 111
against 0 191 111
Pope 0 191 111
Benedict. 0 191 111

Fausti 0 191 112
said 0 191 112
that 0 191 112
Benedict 0 191 112
met 0 191 112
with 0 191 112
Martini 0 191 112
at 0 191 112
the 0 191 112
bishops’ 0 191 112
palace 0 191 112
of 0 191 112
Milan 0 191 112
in 0 191 112
June 0 191 112
2012. 0 191 112

Martini, 0 191 113
Fausti 0 191 113
said, 0 191 113
urged 0 191 113
Benedict 0 191 113
to 0 191 113
resign 0 191 113
the 0 191 113
papacy. 0 191 113

Apparently 0 191 114
at 0 191 114
the 0 191 114
time 0 191 114
of 0 191 114
his 0 191 114
election 0 191 114
in 0 191 114
2005, 0 191 114
Martini 0 191 114
had 0 191 114
said 0 191 114
it 0 191 114
would 0 191 114
be 0 191 114
his 0 191 114
main 0 191 114
task 0 191 114
to 0 191 114
reform 0 191 114
the 0 191 114
Curia. 0 191 114

By 0 191 115
2012, 0 191 115
this 0 191 115
had 0 191 115
proved 0 191 115
impossible. 0 191 115

Why 0 191 116
would 0 191 116
Benedict 0 191 116
take 0 191 116
advice 0 191 116
from 0 191 116
a 0 191 116
man 0 191 116
like 0 191 116
Martini 0 191 116
– 0 191 116
the 1 191 116
“godfather” 1 191 116
of 1 191 116
the 1 191 116
“liberal 1 191 116
wing” 1 191 116
of 1 191 116
European 1 191 116
Catholicism? 1 191 116

I 0 191 117
think 0 191 117
the 0 191 117
question 0 191 117
would 0 191 117
not 0 191 117
even 0 191 117
occur 0 191 117
to 0 191 117
a 0 191 117
man 0 191 117
like 0 191 117
Ratzinger. 0 191 117

They 0 191 118
were 0 191 118
esteemed 0 191 118
academic 0 191 118
colleagues. 0 191 118

They 0 191 119
were 0 191 119
brothers 0 191 119
of 0 191 119
the 0 191 119
episcopate. 0 191 119

They 0 191 120
were 0 191 120
members 0 191 120
of 0 191 120
the 0 191 120
club. 0 191 120

Any 0 191 121
appearance 0 191 121
of 0 191 121
ideological 0 191 121
division 0 191 121
between 0 191 121
them 0 191 121
was, 0 191 121
in 0 191 121
essence, 0 191 121
a 0 191 121
product 0 191 121
of 0 191 121
the 0 191 121
media 0 191 121
narrative. 0 191 121

Why 0 191 122
wouldn’t 0 191 122
the 0 191 122
pope 0 191 122
take 0 191 122
the 0 191 122
advice 0 191 122
of 0 191 122
his 0 191 122
most 0 191 122
respected 0 191 122
and 0 191 122
senior 0 191 122
cardinal? 0 191 122

Why 0 191 123
is 0 191 123
Walter 0 191 123
Kasper 0 191 123
a 0 191 123
cardinal? 0 191 123

One 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
the 0 191 124
most 0 191 124
prominent 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
those 0 191 124
puzzle 0 191 124
pieces 0 191 124
is 0 191 124
the 0 191 124
apparent 0 191 124
inability 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
these 0 191 124
“conservative” 0 191 124
prelates, 0 191 124
to 0 191 124
detect, 0 191 124
let 0 191 124
alone 0 191 124
effectively 0 191 124
oppose, 0 191 124
these 0 191 124
brazen 1 191 124
enemies 1 191 124
of 1 191 124
the 1 191 124
Faith 1 191 124
within 0 191 124
the 0 191 124

and 0 191 124
College 0 191 124
of 0 191 124
Cardinals. 0 191 124

It 0 191 125
beggars 0 191 125
belief 0 191 125
of 0 191 125
ordinary 0 191 125
people 0 191 125
that, 0 191 125
after 0 191 125
so 0 191 125
many 0 191 125
years 0 191 125
of 0 191 125
hearing 0 191 125
and 0 191 125
reading 0 191 125
them, 0 191 125
Ratzinger 0 191 125
would 0 191 125
remain 0 191 125
on 0 191 125
such 0 191 125
friendly 0 191 125

When, 0 191 126
at 0 191 126
his 0 191 126
very 0 191 126
first 0 191 126
Angelus 0 191 126

in 0 191 126
2013, 0 191 126

told 0 191 126
the 0 191 126
crowd 0 191 126
how 0 191 126
much 0 191 126
he 0 191 126
loved 0 191 126
the 0 191 126

quite 0 191 126
a 0 191 126
lot 0 191 126
of 0 191 126
us 0 191 126
who 0 191 126

years 0 191 126
watching 0 191 126

all 0 191 126
headed 0 191 126

Jorge 0 191 127

the 0 191 127

of 0 191 127

In 0 191 128
an 0 191 128
article 0 191 128
on 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
cardinal’s 0 191 128
life’s 0 191 128
work, 0 191 128
Thomas 0 191 128
Jansen, 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
editor-in-chief 0 191 128
of 0 191 128
Katholisch.de, 0 191 128
recently 0 191 128
noted 0 191 128
that 0 191 128
Walter 0 191 128
Kasper 0 191 128
could 0 191 128
not 0 191 128
possibly 0 191 128
have 0 191 128
done 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
damage 0 191 128
he 0 191 128
has 0 191 128
without 0 191 128
the 0 191 128
direct 0 191 128
assistance 0 191 128
of 0 191 128
both 0 191 128
John 0 191 128
Paul 0 191 128
II 0 191 128
and 0 191 128
Pope 0 191 128
Benedict. 0 191 128

The 0 191 129
monstrous 0 191 129
debacle 0 191 129
of 0 191 129
Amoris 0 191 129
Laetitia 0 191 129
is 0 191 129
as 0 191 129
much 0 191 129
Kasper’s 0 191 129
work 0 191 129
as 0 191 129
Bergoglio’s. 0 191 129

This 0 191 130
is 0 191 130
a 0 191 130
man 0 191 130
who 0 191 130
has, 0 191 130
for 0 191 130
40 0 191 130
years, 0 191 130
never 0 191 130
troubled 0 191 130
to 0 191 130
hide 0 191 130
his 0 191 130
heterodox 0 191 130
opinions 0 191 130
and 0 191 130
has 0 191 130
devoted 0 191 130
much 0 191 130
of 0 191 130
his 0 191 130
life 0 191 130
to 0 191 130
a 0 191 130
campaign 0 191 130
to 0 191 130
bring 0 191 130
about 0 191 130
precisely 0 191 130
this 0 191 130
outcome. 0 191 130

Jansen 0 191 131
points 0 191 131
out 0 191 131
that 0 191 131
Kasper 0 191 131
had 0 191 131
already 0 191 131
tried 0 191 131
to 0 191 131
bring 0 191 131
out 0 191 131
the 0 191 131
same 0 191 131
proposal 0 191 131
for 0 191 131
Communion 0 191 131
for 0 191 131
divorced 0 191 131
and 0 191 131
remarried 0 191 131
in 0 191 131
1993, 0 191 131
together 0 191 131
with 0 191 131
Karl 0 191 131
Lehmann, 0 191 131
another 1 191 131
“Sankt 1 191 131
Gallen” 1 191 131
member. 1 191 131

This 0 191 132
was 0 191 132
stopped 0 191 132
by 0 191 132
Ratzinger 0 191 132
and 0 191 132
the 0 191 132
CDF. 0 191 132

But 0 191 133
that 0 191 133
raises 0 191 133
the 0 191 133
next 0 191 133
question; 0 191 133
if 0 191 133
Ratzinger 0 191 133
knew 0 191 133
so 0 191 133
well 0 191 133
what 1 191 133
kind 1 191 133
of 1 191 133
creature 1 191 133
Kasper 1 191 133
was, 1 191 133
why 0 191 133
wasn’t 0 191 133
the 0 191 133
next 0 191 133
step 0 191 133
to 0 191 133
pitch 0 191 133
him 0 191 133
out 0 191 133
of 0 191 133
the 0 191 133
episcopate 0 191 133
on 0 191 133
his 0 191 133
ear? 0 191 133

Why 0 191 134
was 0 191 134
he 0 191 134
not 0 191 134
– 0 191 134
at 0 191 134
the 0 191 134
very 0 191 134
least 0 191 134
– 0 191 134
given 0 191 134
the 0 191 134
same 0 191 134
“silencing” 0 191 134
treatment 0 191 134
as 0 191 134
Kung? 0 191 134

Kasper 0 191 135
has 0 191 135
recently 0 191 135
gone 0 191 135
to 0 191 135
the 0 191 135
media 0 191 135
again 0 191 135
to 0 191 135
complain 0 191 135
of 0 191 135
being 0 191 135
called 0 191 135
a 0 191 135
heretic. 0 191 135

But 0 191 136
it’s 0 191 136
a 0 191 136
simple 0 191 136
truth: 0 191 136
he’s 1 191 136
a 1 191 136
heretic. 1 191 136

Everyone 0 191 137
knows 0 191 137
he’s 0 191 137
a 0 191 137
heretic 0 191 137
because 0 191 137
we 0 191 137
have 0 191 137
heard 0 191 137
him 0 191 137
trumpeting 1 191 137
in 1 191 137
his 1 191 137
blatant 1 191 137
heresies 1 191 137
from 1 191 137
every 1 191 137
rooftop 1 191 137
he 1 191 137
could 1 191 137
find 1 191 137
for 0 191 137
decades. 0 191 137

After 0 191 138
openly 0 191 138
working 0 191 138
against 0 191 138
the 0 191 138
Faith, 0 191 138
instead 0 191 138
of 0 191 138
being 0 191 138
demoted, 0 191 138
silenced, 0 191 138
laicised 0 191 138
and/or 0 191 138
excommunicated, 0 191 138
John 0 191 138
Paul 0 191 138
II 0 191 138
made 0 191 138
him 0 191 138
a 0 191 138
cardinal. 0 191 138

Remember 0 191 139
that 0 191 139
his 0 191 139
scheme 0 191 139
to 0 191 139
Amoris-Latitia-ize 0 191 139
the 0 191 139
Church 0 191 139
was 0 191 139
stopped 0 191 139
by 0 191 139
Ratzinger’s 0 191 139
CDF 0 191 139
in 0 191 139
1993. 0 191 139

But 0 191 140
he 0 191 140
was 0 191 140
not 0 191 140
demoted, 0 191 140
reprimanded 0 191 140
or 0 191 140
corrected 0 191 140
in 0 191 140
any 0 191 140
way. 0 191 140

Nor 0 191 141
was 0 191 141
he 0 191 141
removed 0 191 141
from 0 191 141
places 0 191 141
of 0 191 141
influence. 0 191 141

Far 0 191 142
from 0 191 142

it. 0 191 143
In 0 191 143
1994 0 191 143
Kasper 0 191 143
was 0 191 143
inserted 0 191 143
into 0 191 143
the 0 191 143
Vatican 0 191 143
Curia 0 191 143
by 0 191 143
being 0 191 143
named 0 191 143
co-chair 0 191 143
of 0 191 143
the 0 191 143
International 0 191 143
Commission 0 191 143
for 0 191 143
Lutheran-Catholic 0 191 143
Dialogue. 0 191 143

In 0 191 144
1999, 0 191 144
he 0 191 144
made 0 191 144
another 0 191 144
step 0 191 144
up, 0 191 144
being 0 191 144
appointed 0 191 144
secretary 0 191 144
of 0 191 144
the 0 191 144
Pontifical 0 191 144
Council 0 191 144
for 0 191 144
Promoting 0 191 144
Christian 0 191 144
Unity, 0 191 144
the 0 191 144
“ecumenical” 0 191 144
office 0 191 144
where 0 191 144
his 0 191 144
manifest 0 191 144
religious 0 191 144
indifferentism 0 191 144
could 0 191 144
be 0 191 144
given 0 191 144
free 0 191 144
reign. 0 191 144

In 0 191 145
2001, 0 191 145
he 0 191 145
was 0 191 145
made 0 191 145
a 0 191 145
Cardinal-deacon 0 191 145
with 0 191 145
the 0 191 145
awesome 1 191 145
responsibility 1 191 145
of 0 191 145
voting 0 191 145
in 0 191 145
a 0 191 145
Conclave. 0 191 145

Then 0 191 146
Benedict 0 191 146
allowed 0 191 146
him 0 191 146
to 0 191 146
remain 0 191 146
a 0 191 146
cardinal. 0 191 146

And, 0 191 147
as 0 191 147
if 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
add 0 191 147
a 0 191 147
finishing 1 191 147
touch 1 191 147
to 1 191 147
the 1 191 147
poisoned 1 191 147
cake 1 191 147
that 0 191 147
is 0 191 147
Ratzinger’s 0 191 147
involvement 0 191 147
in 0 191 147
the 0 191 147
creation 0 191 147
of 0 191 147
the 0 191 147
New 0 191 147
Catholic 0 191 147
Paradigm, 0 191 147
Benedict 0 191 147
is 0 191 147
now 0 191 147
being 0 191 147
said 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
have 0 191 147
deliberately 0 191 147
timed 0 191 147
his 0 191 147
resignation 0 191 147
in 0 191 147
order 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
allow 0 191 147
his 0 191 147
old 0 191 147
academic 0 191 147
colleague 0 191 147
to 0 191 147
participate 0 191 147
in 0 191 147
the 0 191 147
2013 0 191 147
Conclave. 0 191 147

As 0 191 148
Jansen 0 191 148
pointed 0 191 148
out, 0 191 148
and 0 191 148
Maike 0 191 148
Hickson 0 191 148
quoted 0 191 148
in 0 191 148
a 0 191 148
piece 0 191 148
for 0 191 148
One 0 191 148
Peter 0 191 148
Five, 0 191 148

Cardinal 0 191 149
Kasper 0 191 149
barely 0 191 149
even 0 191 149
made 0 191 149
it 0 191 149
into 0 191 149
the 0 191 149
last 0 191 149
conclave, 0 191 149
because 0 191 149
he 0 191 149
had 0 191 149
just 0 191 149
turned 0 191 149
80 0 191 149
years 0 191 149
of 0 191 149
age. 0 191 149

But 0 191 150
since 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
date 0 191 150
of 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
death 0 191 150
(or 0 191 150
abdication, 0 191 150
as 0 191 150
it 0 191 150
was 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
case 0 191 150
in 0 191 150
2013) 0 191 150
of 0 191 150
the 0 191 150
pope 0 191 150
is 0 191 150
decisive, 0 191 150
he 0 191 150
was 0 191 150
still 0 191 150
able 0 191 150
to 0 191 150
attend 0 191 150
and 0 191 150
vote 0 191 150
in 0 191 150
that 0 191 150
election. 0 191 150

(As 0 191 151
some 0 191 151
observers 0 191 151
noted, 0 191 151
it 0 191 151
was 0 191 151
a 0 191 151
generous 0 191 151
gesture 0 191 151
toward 0 191 151
Cardinal 0 191 151
Kasper 0 191 151
that 0 191 151
Pope 0 191 151
Benedict 0 191 151
XVI 0 191 151
had 0 191 151
decided 0 191 151
to 0 191 151
retire 0 191 151
in 0 191 151
due 0 191 151
time.) 0 191 151

Excuse 0 191 152
me 0 191 152
Maike, 0 191 152
but 0 191 152
I 0 191 152
don’t 0 191 152
think 0 191 152
this 0 191 152
is 0 191 152
a 0 191 152
parenthetical 0 191 152
issue. 0 191 152

Is 1 191 153
it 1 191 153
any 1 191 153
wonder 1 191 153
that 1 191 153
so 1 191 153
many 1 191 153
Catholics 1 191 153
have 1 191 153
become 1 191 153
disaffected? 1 191 153

Cardinal 0 191 154
Ratzinger, 0 191 154
Pope 0 191 154
“Emeritus” 0 191 154
Benedict 0 191 154
– 0 191 154
whatever 1 191 154
you 1 191 154
want 1 191 154
to 1 191 154
call 1 191 154
yourself 1 191 154
– 0 191 154
I 0 191 154
have 0 191 154
one 0 191 154
question 0 191 154
that 0 191 154
I 0 191 154
would 0 191 154
really 0 191 154
like 0 191 154
you 0 191 154
to 0 191 154
answer: 0 191 154
Why 1 191 154
is 1 191 154
this 1 191 154
man 1 191 154
still 1 191 154
a 1 191 154
cardinal? 1 191 154

Why 1 191 155
is 1 191 155
he 1 191 155
still 1 191 155
a 1 191 155
bishop? 1 191 155

Why 1 191 156
is 1 191 156
he 1 191 156
still 1 191 156
allowed 1 191 156
to 1 191 156
call 1 191 156
himself 1 191 156
a 1 191 156
“Catholic 1 191 156
theologian”? 1 191 156

Why 1 191 157
did 1 191 157
you, 1 191 157
apparently 1 191 157
deliberately, 1 191 157
ensure 1 191 157
that 1 191 157
he 1 191 157
was 1 191 157
able 1 191 157
to 1 191 157
enter 1 191 157
the 1 191 157
Conclave 1 191 157
to 1 191 157
decide 1 191 157
who 1 191 157
your 1 191 157
successor 1 191 157
was 1 191 157
going 1 191 157
to 1 191 157

be? 1 191 158
Doesn’t 0 191 158
anyone 0 191 158
else 0 191 158
want 0 191 158
to 0 191 158
know 0 191 158
this? 0 191 158

Don’t 0 191 159
we 0 191 159
all 0 191 159
want 0 191 159
to 0 191 159
know 0 191 159
why 0 191 159
Hans 0 191 159
Kung 0 191 159
is 0 191 159
still 0 191 159
a 0 191 159
priest? 0 191 159

Why 0 191 160
was 0 191 160
Cardinal 0 191 160
Mahony 0 191 160
allowed 0 191 160
to 0 191 160
retire 0 191 160
in 0 191 160
good 0 191 160
standing? 0 191 160

Why 0 191 161
a 0 191 161
man 0 191 161
like 0 191 161
Weakland, 0 191 161
the 0 191 161
active 1 191 161
homosexual 1 191 161
who 0 191 161
paid 0 191 161
off 0 191 161
his 0 191 161
ex-lover, 0 191 161
was 0 191 161
not 0 191 161
excommunicated? 0 191 161

What 0 191 162
are 0 191 162
the 0 191 162
names 0 191 162
we 0 191 162
all 0 191 162
remember, 0 191 162
just 0 191 162
off 0 191 162
the 0 191 162
top 0 191 162
of 0 191 162
our 0 191 162

I 0 191 163
sometimes 0 191 163
wonder 0 191 163
how 0 191 163
long 0 191 163
that 0 191 163
list 0 191 163
is 0 191 163
going 0 191 163
to 0 191 163
be 0 191 163
when 0 191 163
this 0 191 163
is 0 191 163
all 0 191 163
over. 0 191 163

For 0 191 164
fifty 0 191 164
years 0 191 164
Catholics 0 191 164
have 0 191 164
wanted 0 191 164
to 0 191 164
know 0 191 164
why 0 191 164
nothing 0 191 164
was 0 191 164
ever 0 191 164
done, 0 191 164
as 0 191 164
these 0 191 164
wolves 1 191 164
in 1 191 164
the 1 191 164
episcopate 1 191 164
were 0 191 164
allowed, 0 191 164
year 0 191 164
after 0 191 164
year 0 191 164
to 0 191 164
continue 0 191 164
attacking 0 191 164
the 0 191 164
Church. 0 191 164

Why 1 191 165
have 1 191 165
we 1 191 165
so 1 191 165
often 1 191 165
seen 1 191 165
these 1 191 165
men 1 191 165
– 1 191 165
compromised 1 191 165
intellectually 1 191 165
and 1 191 165
morally 1 191 165
– 1 191 165
elevated 1 191 165
to 1 191 165
superior 1 191 165
rank, 1 191 165
despite 1 191 165
the 1 191 165
incredible 1 191 165
brazenness 1 191 165
of 1 191 165
their 1 191 165
hatred 1 191 165
of 1 191 165
the 1 191 165

of 0 191 168

including 0 191 168
Kasper, 0 191 168
who 0 191 168
openly 0 191 168
campaigned 0 191 168
for 0 191 168
the 0 191 168
effective 0 191 168
abolition 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
Catholic 0 191 168
moral 0 191 168
teaching: 0 191 168
“It 0 191 168
was 0 191 168
characteristic 0 191 168
of 0 191 168
the 0 191 168
church’s 0 191 168

John 0 191 168

II 0 191 168
himself 0 191 168

of 0 191 168
them 0 191 168
their 0 191 168

When 0 191 169
journalists 0 191 169
talk 0 191 169
about 0 191 169
Catholicism, 0 191 169
they 0 191 169
often 0 191 169
speak 0 191 169
of 0 191 169
a 0 191 169
man 0 191 169
like 0 191 169
Kasper 0 191 169
being 0 191 169
– 0 191 169
as 0 191 169
his 0 191 169
Wikipedia 0 191 169

this 0 191 169
is 0 191 169

some 0 191 169

we’re 0 191 169
supposed 0 191 169
to 0 191 169

it 0 191 169

the 0 191 169
reality 0 191 169
of 0 191 169
our 0 191 169

a 0 191 170

and 0 191 170

they’re 0 191 170
both 0 191 170
Catholic. 0 191 170

Steve 0 191 171
Skojec 0 191 171
told 0 191 171
me 0 191 171
that 0 191 171
our 0 191 171
willingness 0 191 171
to 0 191 171
go 0 191 171
along 0 191 171
with 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
whole 0 191 171
“emeritus 1 191 171
pope” 1 191 171
charade 1 191 171
was 0 191 171
an 0 191 171
error: 0 191 171
“I 0 191 171
think 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
problem 0 191 171
is 0 191 171
that 0 191 171
we 0 191 171
all 0 191 171
went 0 191 171
along 0 191 171
with 0 191 171
their 0 191 171
game 0 191 171
of 0 191 171

believe, 0 191 171
and 0 191 171
we 0 191 171
shouldn’t 0 191 171
have.” 0 191 171
In 0 191 171
fact, 0 191 171
I 0 191 171
am 0 191 171
starting 0 191 171
to 0 191 171
think 0 191 171
that 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
willingness 0 191 171
of 0 191 171
most 0 191 171
Catholics 0 191 171
to 0 191 171
go 0 191 171
along 0 191 171
with 0 191 171
the 0 191 171
entire 0 191 171
charade 1 191 171
of 1 191 171
post-conciliar 1 191 171
Catholicism 1 191 171
has 0 191 171
been 0 191 171
a 0 191 171
grave 0 191 171
error. 0 191 171

By 0 191 172
playing 0 191 172
along, 0 191 172
by 0 191 172
pretending 0 191 172
that 0 191 172
we 0 191 172
could 0 191 172
be 0 191 172
“conservative 0 191 172
Catholics” 0 191 172
in 0 191 172
this 0 191 172
New 0 191 172
Paradigm 0 191 172
that 0 191 172
also 0 191 172
includes 0 191 172
“liberal 0 191 172
Catholics” 0 191 172
we 0 191 172
have 0 191 172
helped 0 191 172
them 0 191 172
perpetrate 0 191 172
one 0 191 172
the 0 191 172
most 0 191 172
monstrous 0 191 172
frauds 0 191 172
in 0 191 172
human 0 191 172
history. 0 191 172

Because 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
this 0 191 173
schizophrenic 1 191 173
mindset 1 191 173
of 1 191 173
the 1 191 173
Church’s 1 191 173
leadership 1 191 173
since 0 191 173
1965, 0 191 173
we 0 191 173
have 0 191 173
all 0 191 173
come 0 191 173
to 0 191 173
accept 0 191 173
the 0 191 173
underlying 0 191 173
premise; 0 191 173
that 0 191 173
the 0 191 173
Church 0 191 173
is 0 191 173
a 0 191 173
“big 0 191 173
umbrella” 0 191 173
with 0 191 173
plenty 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
room 0 191 173
for 0 191 173
people 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
all 0 191 173
personal 0 191 173
opinions, 0 191 173
that 0 191 173
such 0 191 173
issues 0 191 173
as 0 191 173
liturgy 0 191 173
are 0 191 173
matters 0 191 173
of 0 191 173
personal 0 191 173
“taste” 0 191 173
…that 0 191 173
two 0 191 173
opposed 0 191 173
things 0 191 173
can 0 191 173
both 0 191 173
be 0 191 173
Catholic 0 191 173
truth. 0 191 173

This 0 191 174
schizophrenia 1 191 174
is 0 191 174
the 0 191 174
model 0 191 174
under 0 191 174
which 0 191 174
“conservatives” 0 191 174
have 0 191 174
operated 0 191 174
all 0 191 174
this 0 191 174
time, 0 191 174
and 0 191 174
by 0 191 174
which 0 191 174
they 0 191 174
have 0 191 174
judged 0 191 174
a 0 191 174
man 0 191 174
like 0 191 174
Joseph 0 191 174
Ratzinger 0 191 174
to 0 191 174
be 0 191 174
a 0 191 174
“conservative 1 191 174
champion 1 191 174
of 1 191 174
orthodoxy.” 1 191 174
And 0 191 174
what 0 191 174
has 0 191 174
this 0 191 174
achieved? 0 191 174

It 0 191 175
created 0 191 175
cover 0 191 175
for 0 191 175
the 0 191 175
men 0 191 175
of 0 191 175
Kasper’s 0 191 175
clique 0 191 175
to 0 191 175
maneuver 0 191 175
their 0 191 175
man 0 191 175
on 0 191 175
the 0 191 175
throne 0 191 175
of 0 191 175
Peter 0 191 175
five 0 191 175
years 0 191 175
ago. 0 191 175

And 0 191 176
just 0 191 176
like 0 191 176
that, 0 191 176
the 0 191 176
jargon 0 191 176
of 0 191 176
“tolerance” 0 191 176
and 0 191 176
the 0 191 176
“big 0 191 176
umbrella” 0 191 176
is 0 191 176
over 0 191 176
and 0 191 176
the 0 191 176
purge 0 191 176
of 0 191 176
faithful, 0 191 176
believing 0 191 176
Catholic 0 191 176
religious, 0 191 176
seminarians, 0 191 176
priests, 0 191 176
and 0 191 176
academics 0 191 176
has 0 191 176
begun. 0 191 176

As 0 191 177
it 0 191 177
had 0 191 177

to. 0 191 178
They, 0 191 178
at 0 191 178
least, 0 191 178
do 0 191 178
not 0 191 178
harbour 0 191 178
this 0 191 178
insane 0 191 178
contradiction, 0 191 178
and 0 191 178
understand 0 191 178
– 0 191 178
and 0 191 178
frequently 0 191 178
say 0 191 178
out 0 191 178
loud 0 191 178
– 0 191 178
that 0 191 178
the 0 191 178
New 0 191 178
Paradigm 0 191 178
and 0 191 178
the 0 191 178
Catholic 0 191 178
Church 0 191 178
are 0 191 178
not 0 191 178
the 0 191 178
same. 0 191 178

And 0 191 179
their 0 191 179
New 0 191 179
Church 0 191 179
is 0 191 179
the 0 191 179
only 0 191 179
one 0 191 179
left. 0 191 179

For 0 191 180
five 0 191 180
decades 0 191 180
we 1 191 180
played 1 191 180
the 1 191 180
Anglican 1 191 180
game; 1 191 180
as 0 191 180
long 0 191 180
as 0 191 180
we 0 191 180
don’t 0 191 180
talk 0 191 180
about 0 191 180
it, 0 191 180
there 0 191 180
isn’t 0 191 180
a 0 191 180
problem. 0 191 180

Ottaviani’s 0 191 181
Holy 0 191 181
Office 0 191 181
and 0 191 181
schema 0 191 181
were 0 191 181
the 1 191 181
last 1 191 181
gasp 1 191 181
of 1 191 181
the 1 191 181

Church 1 191 181
– 0 191 181
and 0 191 181
as 0 191 181
de 0 191 181
Lubac 0 191 181
said 0 191 181
above, 0 191 181
it 0 191 181
was 0 191 181
killed 0 191 181
by 0 191 181
Joseph 0 191 181
Ratzinger. 0 191 181

We 0 191 182
had 0 191 182
a 0 191 182
long 0 191 182
hiatus 0 191 182
in 0 191 182
which 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
popes 0 191 182
pretended 0 191 182
nothing 0 191 182
essential 0 191 182
had 0 191 182
changed, 0 191 182
while 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
institution 0 191 182
around 0 191 182
them 0 191 182
fell 0 191 182
to 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
New 0 191 182
Paradigm, 0 191 182
until 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
papacy 0 191 182
was 0 191 182
the 0 191 182
only 0 191 182
thing 0 191 182
left. 0 191 182

One 0 191 183
of 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
things 0 191 183
I’ve 0 191 183
been 0 191 183
saying 0 191 183
is 0 191 183
a 0 191 183
blessing 0 191 183
in 0 191 183
disguise, 0 191 183
and 0 191 183
an 0 191 183
enormous 0 191 183
relief, 0 191 183
about 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
Bergoglian 0 191 183
era 0 191 183
is 0 191 183
that 0 191 183
we 0 191 183
can 0 191 183
finally 0 191 183
leave 0 191 183
behind 0 191 183
us 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
absurd 0 191 183
situation 0 191 183
of 0 191 183
the 0 191 183
Wojtyla/Ratzinger 0 191 183
era. 0 191 183

We 0 191 184
were 0 191 184
expected 0 191 184
for 0 191 184
all 0 191 184
those 0 191 184
years 0 191 184
to 0 191 184
pretend 0 191 184
we 0 191 184
were 0 191 184
in 0 191 184
the 0 191 184
“New 0 191 184
Springtime 0 191 184
of 0 191 184
Vatican 0 191 184
II,” 0 191 184
while 0 191 184
we 0 191 184
watched 0 191 184
these 0 191 184
wolves 1 191 184
in 1 191 184
shepherds’ 1 191 184
clothing 1 191 184
eating 1 191 184
the 1 191 184
sheep. 1 191 184

Now 0 191 185
we 0 191 185
can, 0 191 185
at 0 191 185
least, 0 191 185
finally 0 191 185
stop 0 191 185
pretending 0 191 185
that 0 191 185
everything 0 191 185
is 0 191 185
just 0 191 185
dandy 0 191 185
under 0 191 185
the 0 191 185
New 1 191 185
Paradigm 1 191 185
of 1 191 185
Merciful 1 191 185
Conciliar 1 191 185
Wonderfulness. 1 191 185

For 0 191 186
those 0 191 186
still 0 191 186
wondering, 0 191 186
Bergoglio 0 191 186
isn’t 0 191 186
a 0 191 186
shock, 0 191 186
he 0 191 186
isn’t 0 191 186
even 0 191 186
a 0 191 186
surprise; 0 191 186
he’s 0 191 186
just 0 191 186
the 0 191 186
logical 0 191 186
end 0 191 186
result. 0 191 186

This 0 191 186

pontificate 0 191 186

isn’t 0 191 186

an 0 191 186

anomaly; 0 191 186

it 0 191 186

was 0 191 186

the 0 191 186

only 0 191 186

possible 0 191 186

outcome, 0 191 186

and 0 191 186

it 0 191 186

was 0 191 186

as 0 191 186

much 0 191 186

the 0 191 186

work 0 191 186

of 0 191 186

Following 0 192 1
what 0 192 1
has 0 192 1
appeared 0 192 1
for 0 192 1
months 0 192 1
to 0 192 1

Trump 0 192 2

Tillerson’s 0 192 2
ouster 0 192 2
via 0 192 2

Tuesday, 0 192 2
saying: 0 192 2

chosen. 0 192 5

Congratulations 0 192 6
to 0 192 6
all!” 0 192 6

This 0 192 7
is 0 192 7
yet 0 192 7
another 0 192 7
big 0 192 7
shake-up 0 192 7
for 0 192 7
Trump’s 0 192 7
still-young 0 192 7
administration 0 192 7
— 0 192 7
and 1 192 7
it 1 192 7
may 1 192 7
be 1 192 7
the 1 192 7
most 1 192 7
important 1 192 7
one 1 192 7
to 1 192 7
date. 1 192 7

The 1 192 8
move 1 192 8
creates 1 192 8
some 1 192 8
big 1 192 8
questions 1 192 8
about 1 192 8
both 1 192 8
the 1 192 8
administration’s 1 192 8
foreign 1 192 8
policy 1 192 8
ambitions 1 192 8
as 1 192 8
well 1 192 8
as 1 192 8
the 1 192 8
president’s 1 192 8
relationship 1 192 8
with 1 192 8
the 1 192 8
deep 1 192 8
state. 1 192 8

If 1 192 9
you 1 192 9
enjoyed 1 192 9
Hillary 1 192 9
Clinton’s 1 192 9
tenure 1 192 9
as 1 192 9
Secretary 1 192 9
of 1 192 9
State, 1 192 9
you’ll 1 192 9
like 1 192 9
Pompeo’s. 1 192 9

Like 0 192 10
Clinton 0 192 10
and 0 192 10
her 0 192 10
Democrat 0 192 10
allies, 0 192 10
Pompeo 0 192 10
has 0 192 10
long 0 192 10
subscribed 0 192 10
to 0 192 10
the 0 192 10
belief 0 192 10
that 0 192 10
Russia 0 192 10
is 1 192 10
perpetually 1 192 10
meddling 1 192 10
in 0 192 10
U.S. 0 192 10
affairs. 0 192 10

In 0 192 11
fact, 0 192 11
he 1 192 11
believes 1 192 11
Barack 1 192 11
Obama 1 192 11
got 1 192 11
Russian 1 192 11
help 1 192 11
too. 1 192 11

While 0 192 12
he 0 192 12
was 0 192 12
being 0 192 12
confirmed 0 192 12
as 0 192 12
CIA 0 192 12
chief, 0 192 12
the 0 192 12
former 0 192 12
lawmaker 0 192 12
lashed 1 192 12
out 1 192 12
at 1 192 12
Russia 1 192 12
for 0 192 12
reasserting 1 192 12
” 1 192 12
itself 1 192 12
aggressively, 1 192 12
invading 1 192 12
and 1 192 12
occupying 1 192 12
Ukraine, 1 192 12
threatening 1 192 12
Europe, 1 192 12
and 1 192 12
doing 1 192 12
nearly 1 192 12
nothing 1 192 12
to 1 192 12
aid 1 192 12
in 1 192 12
the 1 192 12
destruction 1 192 12
and 1 192 12
defeat 1 192 12
of 1 192 12
ISIS.” 1 192 12

Again, 0 192 13
if 0 192 13
you 0 192 13
liked 0 192 13
Obama-era, 0 192 13
world-on-fire, 0 192 13
Russians 0 192 13
everywhere 0 192 13
State 1 192 13
Department 1 192 13
shenanigans, 1 192 13
this 1 192 13
is 1 192 13
your 1 192 13
guy. 1 192 13

Pompeo 1 192 14
also 1 192 14
isn’t 1 192 14
a 1 192 14
huge 1 192 14
fan 1 192 14
of 1 192 14
calling 1 192 14
the 1 192 14
federal 1 192 14
government 1 192 14
out 1 192 14
when 1 192 14
it 1 192 14
is 1 192 14
clearly 1 192 14
violating 1 192 14
the 1 192 14
rights 1 192 14
of 1 192 14
Americans, 1 192 14
as 0 192 14
shown 0 192 14
by 0 192 14
his 0 192 14
statements 0 192 14
last 0 192 14
year 0 192 14
regarding 0 192 14
WikiLeaks. 0 192 14

“It 0 192 15
is 0 192 15
time 0 192 15
to 0 192 15
call 0 192 15
out 0 192 15
WikiLeaks 0 192 15
for 0 192 15
what 0 192 15
it 0 192 15
really 0 192 15
is 0 192 15
– 0 192 15
a 1 192 15
non-state 1 192 15
hostile 1 192 15
intelligence 1 192 15
service 1 192 15
often 0 192 15
abetted 0 192 15
by 0 192 15
state 0 192 15
actors 0 192 15
like 0 192 15
Russia. 0 192 15

In 0 192 16
January 0 192 16
of 0 192 16
this 0 192 16
year, 0 192 16
our 0 192 16
Intelligence 0 192 16
Community 0 192 16
determined 0 192 16
that 0 192 16
Russian 0 192 16
military 0 192 16
intelligence 0 192 16
— 0 192 16
the 0 192 16
GRU 0 192 16
— 0 192 16
had 0 192 16
used 0 192 16
WikiLeaks 0 192 16
to 0 192 16
release 0 192 16
data 0 192 16
of 0 192 16
U.S. 0 192 16
victims 0 192 16
that 0 192 16
the 0 192 16
GRU 0 192 16
had 0 192 16
obtained 0 192 16
through 0 192 16
cyber 0 192 16
operations 0 192 16
against 0 192 16
the 0 192 16
Democratic 0 192 16
National 0 192 16
Committee. 0 192 16

And 0 192 17
the 0 192 17
report 0 192 17
also 0 192 17
found 0 192 17
that 0 192 17
Russia’s 0 192 17
primary 0 192 17
propaganda 0 192 17
outlet, 0 192 17
RT, 0 192 17
has 0 192 17
actively 0 192 17

with 0 192 17

he 0 192 17
said. 0 192 17

Pompeo 0 192 18

increased 0 192 18
U.S. 0 192 18

City… 0 192 19

Moving 0 192 20
on 0 192 20
to 0 192 20
Haspel, 0 192 20
who 0 192 20
will 0 192 20
now 0 192 20
be 0 192 20
heading 0 192 20
the 0 192 20
CIA, 0 192 20
nothing’s 1 192 20
looking 1 192 20
any 1 192 20
brighter. 1 192 20

She’s 1 192 21
a 1 192 21
big 1 192 21
fan 1 192 21
of 1 192 21
torture, 1 192 21
according 0 192 21
to 0 192 21
a 0 192 21
2013 0 192 21
Washington 0 192 21
Post 0 192 21
article 0 192 21
pointed 0 192 21
out 0 192 21
this 0 192 21
morning 0 192 21
by 0 192 21
The 0 192 21
Intercept: 0 192 21

IN 0 192 22
MAY 0 192 22
2013, 0 192 22
the 0 192 22
Washington 0 192 22
Post’s 0 192 22
Greg 0 192 22
Miller 0 192 22
reported 0 192 22
that 0 192 22
the 0 192 22
head 0 192 22
of 0 192 22
the 0 192 22
CIA’s 0 192 22
clandestine 0 192 22
service 0 192 22
was 0 192 22
being 0 192 22
shifted 0 192 22
out 0 192 22
of 0 192 22
that 0 192 22
position 0 192 22
as 0 192 22
a 0 192 22
result 0 192 22
of 0 192 22
“a 0 192 22
management 0 192 22
shake-up” 0 192 22
by 0 192 22
then-Director 0 192 22
John 0 192 22
Brennan. 0 192 22

As 0 192 23
Miller 0 192 23
documented, 0 192 23
this 0 192 23
official 0 192 23
— 0 192 23
whom 0 192 23
the 0 192 23
paper 0 192 23
did 0 192 23
not 0 192 23
name 0 192 23
because 0 192 23
she 0 192 23
was 0 192 23
a 0 192 23
covert 0 192 23
agent 0 192 23
at 0 192 23
the 0 192 23
time 0 192 23
— 0 192 23
was 0 192 23
centrally 0 192 23
involved 0 192 23
in 0 192 23
the 1 192 23
worst 1 192 23
abuses 1 192 23
of 1 192 23
the 1 192 23
CIA’s 1 192 23
Bush-era 1 192 23
torture 1 192 23
regime. 1 192 23

As 0 192 24
Miller 0 192 24
put 0 192 24
it, 0 192 24
she 0 192 24
was 0 192 24
“directly 0 192 24
involved 0 192 24
in 0 192 24
its 0 192 24
controversial 0 192 24
interrogation 0 192 24
program” 0 192 24
and 0 192 24
had 0 192 24
an 0 192 24

“I 0 199 4
frankly 0 199 4

that 0 199 4

are 0 199 4
too 0 199 4

"I 0 199 5
don't 0 199 5

so 0 199 5
I 0 199 5

isn't 1 199 5

He's 0 199 6
right, 0 199 6
too. 0 199 6

happens 0 199 8

such 0 199 8
types 0 199 8
of 0 199 8
regime 0 199 8
changes, 0 199 8
and 0 199 8
the 0 199 8
truth 0 199 8
is 0 199 8
that 0 199 8
they 0 199 8
really 0 199 8
don't 0 199 8
work 0 199 8
out 0 199 8

be 1 199 18
so 1 199 18
fearful 1 199 18

vengeful 1 199 18
that 1 199 18
we 1 199 18

what 0 199 19

could 0 199 19

it 0 199 22

is 1 199 23
trying 1 199 23
to 1 199 23
warn 1 199 23
America 1 199 23
about. 1 199 23

Instead, 0 199 24
people 0 199 24
are 0 199 24
acting 0 199 24
out 0 199 24
of 0 199 24
emotion 0 199 24
and 0 199 24
fear. 0 199 24

Do 0 199 25
I 0 199 25
believe 0 199 25
we 0 199 25
should 0 199 25
be 0 199 25
concerned 0 199 25
about 0 199 25
North 0 199 25
Korea? 0 199 25

Sure, 0 199 26
but 0 199 26
I'm 0 199 26
hardly 0 199 26
worried 0 199 26
that 0 199 26
they 0 199 26
will 0 199 26
actually 0 199 26
attack 0 199 26
us. 0 199 26

Am 0 199 27
I 0 199 27
concerned 0 199 27
about 0 199 27
jihadis? 0 199 27

Yep, 0 199 28
but 0 199 28
I'm 0 199 28
not 0 199 28
sure 0 199 28
I've 0 199 28
seen 0 199 28
any 0 199 28
real 0 199 28
hard 0 199 28
evidence 0 199 28
that 0 199 28
torturing 0 199 28
them 0 199 28
has 0 199 28
produced 0 199 28
any 0 199 28
information 0 199 28
that 0 199 28
has 0 199 28
led 0 199 28
to 0 199 28
stopping 0 199 28
terror 0 199 28
attacks. 0 199 28

And 0 199 29
before 0 199 29
you 0 199 29
tell 0 199 29
me 0 199 29
about 0 199 29
the 0 199 29
media 0 199 29
reports 0 199 29
and 0 199 29
CIA 0 199 29
involvement, 0 199 29
just 0 199 29
keep 0 199 29
in 0 199 29
mind 0 199 29
that 0 199 29
a 1 199 29
former 1 199 29
journalist, 1 199 29
who 1 199 29
is 1 199 29
now 1 199 29
dead, 1 199 29
told 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
world 1 199 29
that 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
media 1 199 29
lies 1 199 29
for 1 199 29
the 1 199 29
CIA. 1 199 29

So, 1 199 30
I'm 1 199 30
wary 1 199 30
of 1 199 30
media 1 199 30
reports 1 199 30
that 1 199 30
claim 1 199 30
there 1 199 30
have 1 199 30
been 1 199 30
results 1 199 30
from 1 199 30
the 1 199 30
tactics 1 199 30
used. 1 199 30

Trump 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
obviously 1 199 31
had 1 199 31
praise 1 199 31
for 1 199 31
both 1 199 31
Pompeo 1 199 31
and 1 199 31
Haspel, 1 199 31
but 1 199 31
then 1 199 31
again, 1 199 31
his 1 199 31
administration 1 199 31
has 1 199 31
quite 1 199 31
a 1 199 31
bit 1 199 31
of 1 199 31
turn 1 199 31
over 1 199 31
too. 1 199 31

Mike 0 199 32
Pompeo, 0 199 32
Director 0 199 32
of 0 199 32
the 0 199 32
CIA, 0 199 32
will 0 199 32
become 0 199 32
our 0 199 32
new 0 199 32
Secretary 0 199 32
of 0 199 32
State. 0 199 32

He 1 199 33
will 1 199 33
do 1 199 33
a 1 199 33
fantastic 1 199 33
job! 1 199 33

Thank 0 199 34
you 0 199 34
to 0 199 34
Rex 0 199 34
Tillerson 0 199 34
for 0 199 34
his 0 199 34
service! 0 199 34

Gina 0 199 35
Haspel 0 199 35
will 0 199 35
become 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
new 0 199 35
Director 0 199 35
of 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
CIA, 0 199 35
and 0 199 35
the 0 199 35
first 0 199 35
woman 0 199 35
so 0 199 35
chosen. 0 199 35

“I 1 200 4

which 0 200 8
we 0 200 8

with 0 200 8
him.” 0 200 8
The 0 200 8
congressman 0 200 8
wasn’t 0 200 8
sure 0 200 8
why 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
ADL 0 200 8
wrote 0 200 8
that 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
had 0 200 8
been 0 200 8
misquoted 0 200 8
in 0 200 8
his 0 200 8
praise 0 200 8
for 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
anti-Semite, 0 200 8
and 0 200 8
said 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
wasn’t 0 200 8
sure 0 200 8
if 0 200 8
someone 0 200 8
from 0 200 8
his 0 200 8
office 0 200 8
had 0 200 8
told 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
ADL 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
was 0 200 8
misquoted, 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
told 0 200 8

Foundation 0 200 8
on 0 200 8
Sunday. 0 200 8

“I 0 200 9
think 0 200 9
that 0 200 9
was 0 200 9
what 0 200 9
they 0 200 9
wanted 0 200 9
to 0 200 9
write. 0 200 9

Nah, 0 200 10
I 0 200 10
don’t 0 200 10
have 0 200 10
no 0 200 10
problems 0 200 10
with 0 200 10
Farrakhan, 0 200 10
I 0 200 10
don’t 0 200 10
spend 0 200 10
a 0 200 10
whole 0 200 10
lot 0 200 10
of 0 200 10
my 0 200 10
time 0 200 10
dealing 0 200 10
with 0 200 10
those 0 200 10
kind 0 200 10
of 0 200 10
things,” 0 200 10
Davis 0 200 10
said. 0 200 10

“That’s 0 200 11
just 0 200 11
one 0 200 11
segment 0 200 11
of 0 200 11
what 0 200 11
goes 0 200 11
on 0 200 11
in 0 200 11
our 0 200 11
world. 0 200 11

The 1 200 12
world 1 200 12
is 1 200 12
so 1 200 12
much 1 200 12
bigger 1 200 12
than 1 200 12
Farrakhan 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
the 1 200 12
Jewish 1 200 12
question 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
his 1 200 12
position 1 200 12
on 1 200 12
that 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
so 1 200 12
forth. 1 200 12

For 0 200 13
those 0 200 13
heavy 0 200 13
into 0 200 13
it, 0 200 13
that’s 0 200 13
their 0 200 13
thing, 0 200 13
but 0 200 13
it 0 200 13
ain’t 0 200 13
my 0 200 13
thing,” 0 200 13
he 0 200 13
said 0 200 13

The 0 200 14
term 0 200 14
"Jewish 0 200 14
Question" 0 200 14
is 0 200 14
largely 0 200 14
used 0 200 14
by 0 200 14
anti-Semites. 0 200 14

So 0 200 15
Davis 0 200 15
then 0 200 15
sorta 0 200 15
disavowed 0 200 15
his 0 200 15
own 0 200 15
statements. 0 200 15

J 0 200 16

endorsed 0 200 16
him. 0 200 16

And 0 200 17
then 0 200 17
he 0 200 17
talked 0 200 17
to 0 200 17

notorious 1 200 18
racist 1 200 18
and 1 200 18
anti-Semite, 1 200 18
does 0 200 18
“outstanding 1 200 18
work” 1 200 18
but 0 200 18
doesn’t 0 200 18
agree 0 200 18
with 0 200 18
Farrakhan’s 0 200 18
positions 0 200 18
that 0 200 18
white 1 200 18
people 1 200 18
are 1 200 18
“devils” 1 200 18
and 1 200 18
Jewish 1 200 18
people 1 200 18
are 1 200 18

Progress! 0 200 19

"I 1 200 20
don’t 1 200 20

Call 1 200 20
when 1 200 20
I 1 200 20

I’ve 1 200 21
been 1 200 21
to 1 200 21
Saviour’s 1 200 21
Day, 1 200 21
I’ve 1 200 21
read, 1 200 21
I’ve 1 200 21
been 1 200 21
a 1 200 21
fan 1 200 21
of 1 200 21
Elijah 1 200 21
Muhammad, 1 200 21
so 1 200 21
those 1 200 21
are 1 200 21
my 1 200 21
positions, 1 200 21
but 1 200 21
I 1 200 21
do 1 200 21
disagree 1 200 21
with 1 200 21
the 1 200 21
notion 1 200 21
that 1 200 21
white 1 200 21
people 1 200 21
are 1 200 21
devils.” 1 200 21

I 1 200 22
wonder 1 200 22
how 1 200 22
far 1 200 22
a 1 200 22
white 1 200 22
congressman 1 200 22
would 1 200 22
get 1 200 22
saying, 1 200 22
"I 1 200 22
attended 1 200 22

I 1 200 22
don't 1 200 22

that's 0 200 23
Rep. 0 200 23

But 0 200 25
doesn't 0 200 25
believe 0 200 25
white 0 200 25
people 0 200 25
are 0 200 25
devils 1 200 25
or 0 200 25

Whoever 0 200 26

they 0 203 2
didn’t 0 203 2

course, 1 203 4
even 1 203 4
if 1 203 4
they 1 203 4
had 1 203 4

And 1 203 6
that 1 203 6
is 1 203 6
that 1 203 6
there 1 203 6
is 1 203 6
a 1 203 6
war 1 203 6

We 1 203 7

that 1 203 7
the 1 203 7

State, 1 203 7
al-Qaeda 1 203 7

have 1 203 7
called 1 203 7
upon 1 203 7
Muslims 1 203 7
in 1 203 7
the 1 203 7
U.S. 1 203 7
to 1 203 7
try 1 203 7
to 1 203 7
kill 1 203 7
military 1 203 7
personnel 1 203 7
and 1 203 7
police, 1 203 7
as 1 203 7
well 1 203 7
as 1 203 7
civilians. 1 203 7

We 0 203 8
know 0 203 8
that 0 203 8
Kazi, 0 203 8
with 0 203 8
all 0 203 8
the 0 203 8
propane 0 203 8
and 0 203 8
gas 0 203 8
tanks 0 203 8
in 0 203 8
his 0 203 8

was 0 203 8
clearly 0 203 8
trying 0 203 8
to 0 203 8
set 0 203 8
off 0 203 8
a 0 203 8
major 0 203 8
fire 0 203 8
that 0 203 8
would 0 203 8
kill 0 203 8
more 0 203 8
people 0 203 8
than 0 203 8
just 0 203 8
himself. 0 203 8

Even 0 203 9
if 0 203 9
he 0 203 9
wasn’t 0 203 9
on 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
phone 0 203 9
to 0 203 9
Baghdadi, 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
likelihood 0 203 9
is 0 203 9
that 0 203 9
when 0 203 9
a 0 203 9

with 0 203 9
a 0 203 9
car 0 203 9
full 0 203 9
of 0 203 9
incendiaries, 0 203 9
probably 0 203 9
this 0 203 9
has 0 203 9
something 0 203 9
to 0 203 9
do 0 203 9
with 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
global 0 203 9
jihad. 0 203 9

The 0 203 10
FBI’s 0 203 10
bafflement 0 203 10
here 0 203 10
is 0 203 10
part 0 203 10
of 0 203 10
its 0 203 10
deep, 0 203 10
deep 0 203 10
corruption. 0 203 10

The 0 203 11
FBI 0 203 11
doesn’t 0 203 11
acknowledge 0 203 11
that 0 203 11
there 0 203 11
is 0 203 11
a 0 203 11
global 0 203 11
jihad, 0 203 11
or 0 203 11
that 0 203 11
Islam 0 203 11
has 0 203 11
anything 0 203 11
to 0 203 11
do 0 203 11
with 0 203 11
terrorism. 0 203 11

It 0 203 12
doesn’t 0 203 12
admit 0 203 12
that 0 203 12
there 0 203 12
is 0 203 12
a 0 203 12
war 0 203 12
going 0 203 12
on, 0 203 12
and 0 203 12
treats 0 203 12
each 0 203 12
act 0 203 12
of 0 203 12
Islamic 0 203 12
terror 0 203 12
as 0 203 12
if 0 203 12
it 0 203 12
were 0 203 12
a 0 203 12
separate 0 203 12
and 0 203 12
discrete 0 203 12
criminal 0 203 12
event, 0 203 12
unrelated 0 203 12
to 0 203 12
all 0 203 12
the 0 203 12
others. 0 203 12

So, 0 203 13
each 0 203 13
time 0 203 13
something 0 203 13
like 0 203 13
this 0 203 13
happens, 0 203 13
they’re 0 203 13
back 0 203 13
at 0 203 13
Square 0 203 13
One, 0 203 13
trying 0 203 13
to 0 203 13
figure 0 203 13
out 0 203 13
motive. 0 203 13

It’s 0 203 14
as 0 203 14
if 0 203 14
the 0 203 14
U.S. 0 203 14
Army 0 203 14
stopped 0 203 14
to 0 203 14
interrogate 0 203 14
every 0 203 14
German 0 203 14
soldier 0 203 14
who 0 203 14
crashed 0 203 14
through 0 203 14
the 0 203 14
Ardennes 0 203 14

the 0 203 14
Bulge 0 203 14
in 0 203 14
1944, 0 203 14
to 0 203 14
see 0 203 14
if 0 203 14
each 0 203 14
one’s 0 203 14
actions 0 203 14
had 0 203 14
anything 0 203 14
to 0 203 14
do 0 203 14
with 0 203 14
the 0 203 14
German 1 203 14
Army 1 203 14
and 1 203 14
Adolf 1 203 14
Hitler’s 1 203 14

This 0 203 15
willful 0 203 15
ignorance 0 203 15
leads 0 203 15
to 0 203 15

The 0 210 12

its 0 211 11
name. 0 211 11

Why 0 211 12
is 0 211 12
it 0 211 12

It 0 211 17
is 0 211 17
not 0 211 17

most 0 211 17
succumb 0 211 17
to 0 211 17
the 0 211 17
disease. 0 211 17

Why 0 211 18
does 0 211 18
it 0 211 18
keep 0 211 18
coming 0 211 18
back? 0 211 18

“There 0 214 23

I 0 214 24
had 0 214 24

for 0 214 24
over 0 214 24
10 0 214 24
years 0 214 24
since 0 214 24

the 0 214 24
United 0 214 24

America 0 214 24
should 0 214 24
be 0 214 24
the 0 214 24
overthrow 0 214 24
of 0 214 24
the 0 214 24
mullahs’ 0 214 24

the 0 214 25
objectives 0 214 25
of 0 214 25
the 0 214 25

are 0 214 25
not 0 214 25
going 0 214 25

change, 0 214 25
and 0 214 25
therefore 0 214 25
the 0 214 25
only 0 214 25
solution 0 214 25
is 0 214 25
to 0 214 25
change 0 214 25
the 0 214 25

itself. 0 214 25

that’s 0 214 26

the 0 214 30

While 0 214 32
the 0 214 32
current 0 214 32
Iranian 0 214 32
regime 0 214 32
is 0 214 32
certainly 0 214 32
no 0 214 32
bastion 0 214 32

a 0 214 32

for 0 214 32
the 0 214 32

Iran 0 214 32
or 0 214 32
American 0 214 32

is 0 214 32
outright 1 214 32
insane. 1 214 32

what 0 214 33
US 0 214 33

“This 0 214 36

we’re 0 214 36
going 0 214 36

in 0 214 36
five 0 214 36

Clark 0 214 36
said. 0 214 36

“Starting 0 214 37
with 0 214 37

an 0 215 22
explicit 0 215 22
policy 0 215 22
of 0 215 22
regime 0 215 22
change, 0 215 22
something 0 215 22
the 0 215 22
Obama 0 215 22
administration 0 215 22
opposed 0 215 22
when 0 215 22
popular 0 215 22
protests 0 215 22
gripped 0 215 22
Iran 0 215 22
in 0 215 22
2009. 0 215 22

The 0 215 23
regime 0 215 23
change 0 215 23
plan 0 215 23
seeks 0 215 23
to 0 215 23
fundamentally 0 215 23
shift 0 215 23
U.S. 0 215 23
policy 0 215 23
towards 0 215 23
Iran 0 215 23
and 0 215 23
has 0 215 23
found 0 215 23
a 0 215 23
receptive 0 215 23
audience 0 215 23
in 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
Trump 0 215 23
administration, 0 215 23
which 0 215 23
has 0 215 23
been 0 215 23
moving 0 215 23
in 0 215 23
this 0 215 23
direction 0 215 23
since 0 215 23
Bolton—a 0 215 23
longtime 0 215 23
and 0 215 23
vocal 0 215 23
supporter 0 215 23
of 0 215 23
regime 0 215 23
change—entered 0 215 23
the 0 215 23
White 0 215 23
House. 0 215 23

Ah, 0 215 24
yes, 0 215 24
John 0 215 24
Bolton. 0 215 24

While 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
applaud 0 215 25
Bolton 0 215 25
for 0 215 25
his 0 215 25
willingness 0 215 25
to 0 215 25
call 0 215 25
Islamic 0 215 25
jihadis 0 215 25
just 0 215 25
that, 0 215 25
I 0 215 25
am 0 215 25
not 0 215 25
so 0 215 25
naive 0 215 25
as 0 215 25
to 0 215 25
consider 0 215 25
that 0 215 25
his 0 215 25
membership 0 215 25
in 0 215 25
the 0 215 25
Council 0 215 25
on 0 215 25
Foreign 0 215 25
Relations 0 215 25
has 0 215 25
no 0 215 25
effect 0 215 25
in 0 215 25
this 0 215 25
decision. 0 215 25

"The 0 215 26
ordinary 0 215 26
people 0 215 26
of 0 215 26
Iran 0 215 26
are 0 215 26
suffering 0 215 26
under 0 215 26
economic 0 215 26
stagnation, 0 215 26
while 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
regime 0 215 26
ships 0 215 26
its 0 215 26
wealth 0 215 26
abroad 0 215 26

and 0 215 26
to 0 215 26
pad 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
bank 0 215 26
accounts 0 215 26
of 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
Mullahs 0 215 26
and 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
IRGC 0 215 26
command," 0 215 26
SSG 0 215 26
writes 0 215 26
in 0 215 26
the 0 215 26
paper. 0 215 26

"This 0 215 27
has 0 215 27
provoked 0 215 27
noteworthy 0 215 27
protests 0 215 27
across 0 215 27
the 0 215 27
country 0 215 27
in 0 215 27
recent 0 215 27
months." 0 215 27

Well, 0 215 28
why 0 215 28
is 0 215 28
that? 0 215 28

It's 0 215 29
due 0 215 29
to 0 215 29
sanctions 0 215 29
imposed 0 215 29
by 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
likes 0 215 29
of 0 215 29
the 0 215 29
US. 0 215 29

As 0 215 30
has 0 215 30
been 0 215 30
pointed 0 215 30
out 0 215 30
before, 0 215 30
sanctions 0 215 30
hurt 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
people, 0 215 30
not 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
governments 0 215 30
that 0 215 30
lead 0 215 30
them 0 215 30
and 0 215 30
then 0 215 30
those 0 215 30
same 0 215 30
governments 0 215 30
use 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
effects 0 215 30
to 0 215 30
propagandize 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
people 0 215 30
against 0 215 30
those 0 215 30
who 0 215 30
are 0 215 30
ordering 0 215 30
the 0 215 30
sanctions. 0 215 30

I'm 0 215 31
not 0 215 31
saying 0 215 31
the 0 215 31
Iranian 0 215 31
government 0 215 31
is 0 215 31
good, 0 215 31
but 0 215 31
it 0 215 31
is 0 215 31
Iran's 0 215 31
government. 0 215 31

Honestly, 0 215 32
I 0 215 32
see 0 215 32
a 0 215 32
ton 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
corruption 0 215 32
and 0 215 32
warmongering 0 215 32
in 0 215 32
our 0 215 32
own 0 215 32
government 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
rivals 0 215 32
some 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
of 0 215 32
governments 0 215 32
that 0 215 32
America 0 215 32
stands 0 215 32
against. 0 215 32

Still, 0 215 33
as 0 215 33
was 0 215 33
pointed 0 215 33
out 0 215 33
by 0 215 33
Matt 0 215 33
Agorist, 0 215 33
Bolton 0 215 33
told 0 215 33
an 0 215 33
audience 0 215 33
of 0 215 33
the 0 215 33
Grand 0 215 33
Gathering 0 215 33
of 0 215 33
Iranians 0 215 33
for 0 215 33
Free 0 215 33
Iran: 0 215 33

“There 0 215 34
is 0 215 34
a 0 215 34
viable 0 215 34
opposition 0 215 34
to 0 215 34
the 0 215 34
rule 0 215 34
of 0 215 34
the 0 215 34
ayatollahs, 0 215 34
and 0 215 34
that 0 215 34
opposition 0 215 34
is 0 215 34
centered 0 215 34
in 0 215 34
this 0 215 34
room 0 215 34
today. 0 215 34

I 0 215 35
had 0 215 35
said 0 215 35
for 0 215 35
over 0 215 35
10 0 215 35
years 0 215 35
since 0 215 35
coming 0 215 35
to 0 215 35
these 0 215 35
events, 0 215 35
that 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
declared 0 215 35
policy 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
United 0 215 35
States 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
America 0 215 35
should 0 215 35
be 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
overthrow 0 215 35
of 0 215 35
the 0 215 35
mullahs’ 0 215 35
regime 0 215 35
in 0 215 35
Tehran. 0 215 35

The 0 215 36
behavior 0 215 36
and 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
objectives 0 215 36
of 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
regime 0 215 36
are 0 215 36
not 0 215 36
going 0 215 36
to 0 215 36
change, 0 215 36
and 0 215 36
therefore 0 215 36
the 1 215 36
only 1 215 36
solution 1 215 36
is 0 215 36
to 0 215 36
change 0 215 36
the 0 215 36
regime 0 215 36
itself. 0 215 36

And 0 215 37
that’s 0 215 37
why, 0 215 37
before 0 215 37
2019, 0 215 37
we 0 215 37
here 0 215 37
will 0 215 37
celebrate 0 215 37
in 0 215 37
Tehran!” 0 215 37

And 0 215 38
again, 0 215 38
this 0 215 38
really 0 215 38
has 0 215 38
nothing 0 215 38
to 0 215 38
do 0 215 38
with 0 215 38
the 0 215 38
US. 0 215 38

One 0 215 39
source 0 215 39
close 0 215 39
to 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
White 0 215 39
House 0 215 39
who 0 215 39
has 0 215 39
previewed 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
plan 0 215 39
told 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
Free 0 215 39
Beacon 0 215 39
that 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
nuclear 0 215 39
deal, 0 215 39
also 0 215 39
known 0 215 39
as 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
JCPOA, 0 215 39
solidified 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
Iranian 0 215 39
regime’s 0 215 39
grip 0 215 39
on 0 215 39
power 0 215 39
and 0 215 39
intentionally 0 215 39
prevented 0 215 39
the 0 215 39
United 0 215 39
States 0 215 39
from 0 215 39
fomenting 0 215 39
regime 0 215 39
change. 0 215 39

“The 0 215 40
JCPOA 0 215 40
purposefully 0 215 40
destroyed 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
carefully 0 215 40
created 0 215 40
global 0 215 40
consensus 0 215 40
against 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
Islamic 0 215 40
Republic,” 0 215 40
said 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
source, 0 215 40
who 0 215 40
would 0 215 40
only 0 215 40
speak 0 215 40
to 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
Free 0 215 40
Beacon 0 215 40
on 0 215 40
background 0 215 40
about 0 215 40
the 0 215 40
sensitive 0 215 40
issue. 0 215 40

“Prior 0 215 41
to 0 215 41
that, 0 215 41
everyone 0 215 41
understood 0 215 41
the 0 215 41
dangers 0 215 41
of 0 215 41
playing 0 215 41
footsie 0 215 41
with 0 215 41
the 0 215 41
world’s 0 215 41
largest 0 215 41
state 0 215 41
sponsor 0 215 41
of 0 215 41
terrorism. 0 215 41

It’s 0 215 42
now 0 215 42
Trump, 0 215 42
Bolton, 0 215 42
and 0 215 42
[Mike] 0 215 42
Pompeo’s 0 215 42
job 0 215 42
to 0 215 42
put 0 215 42
this 0 215 42
consensus 0 215 42
back 0 215 42
in 0 215 42
place.” 0 215 42

The 0 215 43
source 0 215 43
told 0 215 43
the 0 215 43
Beacon 0 215 43
that 0 215 43
Bolton 0 215 43
is 0 215 43
“acutely 0 215 43
aware 0 215 43
of 0 215 43
the 0 215 43
danger 0 215 43
the 0 215 43
Iranian 0 215 43
regime 0 215 43
poses 0 215 43
to 0 215 43

“John 0 215 44
is 0 215 44
someone 0 215 44

the 0 215 44
danger 0 215 44
of 0 215 44
Iran 0 215 44
viscerally, 0 215 44
and 0 215 44
knows 0 215 44
that 0 215 44
you’re 0 215 44
never 0 215 44
going 0 215 44
to 0 215 44
fundamentally 0 215 44
change 0 215 44
its 0 215 44
behavior—and 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
threats 0 215 44
against 0 215 44
Israel 0 215 44
and 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
Saudis 0 215 44
especially—until 0 215 44
that 0 215 44
revolutionary 0 215 44
regime 0 215 44
is 0 215 44
gone,” 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
source 0 215 44
said, 0 215 44
adding 0 215 44
that 0 215 44
“nothing’s 0 215 44
off 0 215 44
the 0 215 44
table 0 215 44
right 0 215 44
now 0 215 44
if 0 215 44
Israel 0 215 44
is 0 215 44
attacked.” 0 215 44

OK, 0 215 45
I 0 215 45
get 0 215 45
they 0 215 45
may 0 215 45
pose 0 215 45
a 0 215 45
danger, 0 215 45
but 0 215 45
let's 0 215 45
look 0 215 45
at 0 215 45
the 0 215 45
reality 0 215 45
here. 0 215 45

Those 0 215 46
they 0 215 46
pose 0 215 46
a 0 215 46
danger 0 215 46
to, 0 215 46
namely 0 215 46
Saudi 0 215 46
Arabia 0 215 46
and 0 215 46
Israel 0 215 46
can 0 215 46
both 0 215 46
fend 0 215 46
perfectly 0 215 46
well 0 215 46
for 0 215 46
themselves 0 215 46
and 0 215 46
have 0 215 46
demonstrated 0 215 46
that 0 215 46
ability 0 215 46
to 0 215 46
do 0 215 46
it. 0 215 46

There 0 215 47
is 0 215 47
no 0 215 47
need 0 215 47
for 0 215 47
the 0 215 47
US 0 215 47
to 0 215 47
be 0 215 47
involved 0 215 47
in 0 215 47
it 0 215 47
in 0 215 47
any 0 215 47
way. 0 215 47

Why 0 215 48
should 0 215 48
we 0 215 48
be 0 215 48
fighting 0 215 48
a 0 215 48
battle 0 215 48
or 0 215 48
encouraging, 0 215 48
funding, 0 215 48
and 0 215 48
I'm 0 215 48
quite 0 215 48
sure 0 215 48
arming, 0 215 48
a 0 215 48
rebellion? 0 215 48

Where 0 215 49
is 0 215 49
that 0 215 49
authorized 0 215 49
in 0 215 49
our 1 215 49
Constitution? 1 215 49

Simple. 0 215 50

It 0 215 51
isn't. 0 215 51

I 0 215 52
care 0 215 52
little 0 215 52
for 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
Saudi 0 215 52
government 0 215 52
as 0 215 52
they 0 215 52
help 0 215 52
push 0 215 52
Sharia 0 215 52
and 0 215 52
is 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
land 0 215 52
where 0 215 52
many 0 215 52
of 0 215 52
the 0 215 52
9-11 0 215 52
hijackers 0 215 52
came 0 215 52
from. 0 215 52

The 0 215 53
Iranian 0 215 53
government 0 215 53
I 0 215 53
care 0 215 53
for 0 215 53
even 0 215 53
less, 0 215 53
but 0 215 53
out 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
each 0 215 53
of 0 215 53
those, 0 215 53
which 0 215 53
one 0 215 53
should 0 215 53
America 0 215 53
have 0 215 53
dealt 0 215 53
with 0 215 53
militarily 0 215 53
following 0 215 53
9-11? 0 215 53

Both, 0 215 54
if 0 215 54
you're 0 215 54

we 0 215 54
have 0 215 54
a 0 215 54

Why 0 215 55
can't 0 215 55
America 0 215 55
focus 0 215 55
on 0 215 55
it's 0 215 55
own 0 215 55
issues 0 215 55
and 0 215 55
solve 0 215 55
those? 0 215 55

It's 0 215 56
because 0 215 56
we 0 215 56
are 0 215 56
too 0 215 56
busy 0 215 56
trying 0 215 56
to 0 215 56
police 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
world, 0 215 56
keeping 0 215 56
the 0 215 56
spotlight 0 215 56
off 0 215 56
of 0 215 56
those 0 215 56
in 0 215 56
our 0 215 56
government 0 215 56
who 0 215 56
are 0 215 56
attacking 0 215 56
our 0 215 56
rights 0 215 56
and 0 215 56
spending 0 215 56
us 0 215 56
into 0 215 56
more 0 215 56
and 0 215 56
more 0 215 56
debt. 0 215 56

And 0 215 57
lest 0 215 57
you 0 215 57
think 0 215 57
this 0 215 57
is 0 215 57
about 0 215 57
the 0 215 57
nuclear 0 215 57
deal. 0 215 57

It 0 215 58
isn't. 0 215 58

“The 0 215 59

if 0 215 81
the 0 215 81

let 0 215 81
the 0 215 81
passion 0 215 81
that 0 215 81
burns 0 215 81
inside 0 215 81
men 0 215 81
to 0 215 81
be 0 215 81
free 0 215 81
rise 0 215 81
up 0 215 81
as 0 215 81
it 0 215 81
did 0 215 81
in 0 215 81
our 0 215 81
forefathers 0 215 81

Abraham’s 0 328 21
account… 0 328 21

“And 0 328 22
the 0 328 22
men 0 328 22
rose 0 328 22
up 0 328 22
from 0 328 22
thence, 0 328 22
and 0 328 22
looked 0 328 22
toward 0 328 22
Sodom: 0 328 22
and 0 328 22
Abraham 0 328 22
went 0 328 22
with 0 328 22
them 0 328 22
to 0 328 22
bring 0 328 22
them 0 328 22
on 0 328 22
the 0 328 22
way. 0 328 22

And 0 328 23
the 0 328 23
Lord 0 328 23
said, 0 328 23
Shall 0 328 23
I 0 328 23
hide 0 328 23
from 0 328 23
Abraham 0 328 23
that 0 328 23
thing 0 328 23
which 0 328 23
I 0 328 23
do; 0 328 23
Seeing 0 328 23
that 0 328 23
Abraham 0 328 23
shall 0 328 23
surely 0 328 23
become 0 328 23
a 0 328 23
great 0 328 23
and 0 328 23
mighty 0 328 23
nation, 0 328 23

the 0 328 23
nations 0 328 23
of 0 328 23
the 0 328 23

For 0 328 24
I 0 328 24
know 0 328 24
him, 0 328 24
that 0 328 24
he 0 328 24
will 0 328 24
command 0 328 24

household 0 328 24
after 0 328 24
him, 0 328 24
and 0 328 24
they 0 328 24
shall 0 328 24
keep 0 328 24
the 0 328 24
way 0 328 24
of 0 328 24
the 0 328 24
Lord, 0 328 24
to 0 328 24
do 0 328 24
justice 0 328 24
and 0 328 24
judgment; 0 328 24
that 0 328 24
the 0 328 24
Lord 0 328 24
may 0 328 24
bring 0 328 24

Abraham 0 328 24
that 0 328 24

him. 0 328 24

And 0 328 25
the 0 328 25
Lord 0 328 25
said, 0 328 25
Because 0 328 25
the 0 328 25
cry 0 328 25
of 0 328 25
Sodom 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
Gomorrah 0 328 25
is 0 328 25
great, 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
because 0 328 25
their 0 328 25
sin 0 328 25
is 0 328 25
very 0 328 25
grievous; 0 328 25
I 0 328 25
will 0 328 25
go 0 328 25
down 0 328 25
now, 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
see 0 328 25
whether 0 328 25
they 0 328 25
have 0 328 25
done 0 328 25
altogether 0 328 25
according 0 328 25
to 0 328 25
the 0 328 25
cry 0 328 25
of 0 328 25
it, 0 328 25
which 0 328 25
is 0 328 25
come 0 328 25
unto 0 328 25
me; 0 328 25
and 0 328 25
if 0 328 25
not, 0 328 25
I 0 328 25
will 0 328 25
know. 0 328 25

And 0 328 26
the 0 328 26
men 0 328 26
turned 0 328 26
their 0 328 26
faces 0 328 26
from 0 328 26
thence, 0 328 26
and 0 328 26
went 0 328 26
toward 0 328 26
Sodom: 0 328 26
but 0 328 26
Abraham 0 328 26
stood 0 328 26
yet 0 328 26
before 0 328 26
the 0 328 26
Lord. 0 328 26

And 0 328 27
Abraham 0 328 27
drew 0 328 27
near, 0 328 27
and 0 328 27
said, 0 328 27
Wilt 0 328 27
thou 0 328 27
also 0 328 27
destroy 0 328 27
the 1 328 27
righteous 1 328 27
with 0 328 27
the 1 328 27
wicked? 1 328 27

there 0 328 28
be 0 328 28
fifty 0 328 28
righteous 1 328 28

city: 0 328 28
wilt 0 328 28
thou 0 328 28
also 0 328 28
destroy 0 328 28
and 0 328 28
not 0 328 28
spare 0 328 28
the 0 328 28
place 0 328 28
for 0 328 28
the 0 328 28
fifty 0 328 28
righteous 1 328 28
that 0 328 28
are 0 328 28
therein? 0 328 28

That 0 328 29
be 0 328 29
far 0 328 29

thee 0 328 29
to 0 328 29
do 0 328 29
after 0 328 29
this 0 328 29
manner, 0 328 29
to 0 328 29
slay 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
righteous 1 328 29
with 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
wicked: 1 328 29
and 0 328 29
that 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
righteous 1 328 29
should 0 328 29
be 0 328 29
as 0 328 29
the 1 328 29
wicked, 1 328 29
that 0 328 29
be 0 328 29
far 0 328 29
from 0 328 29
thee: 0 328 29
Shall 0 328 29
not 0 328 29
the 0 328 29
Judge 0 328 29
of 0 328 29
all 0 328 29
the 0 328 29
earth 0 328 29
do 0 328 29
right? 0 328 29

And 0 328 30
the 0 328 30
Lord 0 328 30
said, 0 328 30
If 0 328 30
I 0 328 30
find 0 328 30
in 0 328 30
Sodom 0 328 30
fifty 0 328 30
righteous 1 328 30
within 0 328 30
the 0 328 30
city, 0 328 30
then 0 328 30
I 0 328 30
will 0 328 30
spare 0 328 30
all 0 328 30
the 0 328 30
place 0 328 30
for 0 328 30
their 0 328 30
sakes. 0 328 30

And 0 328 31
Abraham 0 328 31
answered 0 328 31
and 0 328 31
said, 0 328 31
Behold 0 328 31
now, 0 328 31
I 0 328 31
have 0 328 31
taken 0 328 31
upon 0 328 31
me 0 328 31
to 0 328 31
speak 0 328 31
unto 0 328 31
the 0 328 31
Lord, 0 328 31
which 0 328 31
am 0 328 31
but 0 328 31
dust 0 328 31
and 0 328 31
ashes: 0 328 31
Peradventure 0 328 31
there 0 328 31
shall 0 328 31
lack 0 328 31
five 0 328 31
of 0 328 31
the 0 328 31
fifty 0 328 31
righteous: 1 328 31
wilt 0 328 31
thou 0 328 31
destroy 0 328 31
all 0 328 31
the 0 328 31
city 0 328 31
for 0 328 31
lack 0 328 31
of 0 328 31
five? 0 328 31

And 0 328 32
he 0 328 32
said, 0 328 32
If 0 328 32
I 0 328 32
find 0 328 32
there 0 328 32
forty 0 328 32
and 0 328 32
five, 0 328 32
I 0 328 32
will 0 328 32
not 0 328 32
destroy 0 328 32
it. 0 328 32

And 0 328 33
he 0 328 33
spake 0 328 33
unto 0 328 33
him 0 328 33
yet 0 328 33
again, 0 328 33
and 0 328 33
said, 0 328 33
Peradventure 0 328 33
there 0 328 33
shall 0 328 33
be 0 328 33
forty 0 328 33
found 0 328 33
there. 0 328 33

And 0 328 34
he 0 328 34
said, 0 328 34
I 0 328 34
will 0 328 34
not 0 328 34
do 0 328 34
it 0 328 34
for 0 328 34
forty's 0 328 34
sake. 0 328 34

And 0 328 35
he 0 328 35
said 0 328 35
unto 0 328 35
him, 0 328 35
Oh 0 328 35
let 0 328 35
not 0 328 35
the 0 328 35
Lord 0 328 35
be 0 328 35
angry, 0 328 35
and 0 328 35
I 0 328 35
will 0 328 35
speak: 0 328 35
Peradventure 0 328 35
there 0 328 35
shall 0 328 35
thirty 0 328 35
be 0 328 35
found 0 328 35
there. 0 328 35

And 0 328 36
he 0 328 36
said, 0 328 36
I 0 328 36
will 0 328 36
not 0 328 36
do 0 328 36
it, 0 328 36
if 0 328 36
I 0 328 36
find 0 328 36
thirty 0 328 36
there. 0 328 36

And 0 328 37
he 0 328 37
said, 0 328 37
Behold 0 328 37
now, 0 328 37
I 0 328 37
have 0 328 37
taken 0 328 37
upon 0 328 37
me 0 328 37
to 0 328 37

Peradventure 0 328 37

shall 0 328 37
be 0 328 37
twenty 0 328 37
found 0 328 37
there. 0 328 37

And 0 328 38
he 0 328 38
said, 0 328 38
I 0 328 38
will 0 328 38
not 0 328 38
destroy 0 328 38
it 0 328 38
for 0 328 38

sake. 0 328 38

And 0 328 39
he 0 328 39
said, 0 328 39
Oh 0 328 39
let 0 328 39
not 0 328 39
the 0 328 39
Lord 0 328 39
be 0 328 39
angry, 0 328 39
and 0 328 39
I 0 328 39
will 0 328 39
speak 0 328 39
yet 0 328 39
but 0 328 39
this 0 328 39
once: 0 328 39
Peradventure 0 328 39
ten 0 328 39
shall 0 328 39
be 0 328 39
found 0 328 39
there. 0 328 39

And 0 328 41
the 0 328 41
Lord 0 328 41
went 0 328 41
his 0 328 41
way, 0 328 41

old 0 328 47
— 0 328 47
surrounded 0 328 47
the 0 328 47
house. 0 328 47

They 0 328 48
called 0 328 48
to 0 328 48
Lot, 0 328 48
'Where 0 328 48

Bring 0 328 49
them 0 328 49
out 0 328 49

us 0 328 49

that 1 328 49
we 1 328 49

The 0 328 50
angels 0 328 50

proceed 0 328 50
to 0 328 50

all 0 328 50
the 0 328 50
men 0 328 50
of 0 328 50
Sodom 0 328 50
and 0 328 50
Gomorrah 0 328 50
and 0 328 50
urge 0 328 50
Lot 0 328 50
and 0 328 50
his 0 328 50
family 0 328 50
to 0 328 50
flee 0 328 50
from 0 328 50
the 0 328 50
cities 0 328 50
to 0 328 50
escape 0 328 50
the 0 328 50
wrath 0 328 50
that 0 328 50
God 0 328 50
was 0 328 50
about 0 328 50
to 0 328 50
deliver. 0 328 50

Lot 0 328 51
and 0 328 51
his 0 328 51
family 0 328 51
flee 0 328 51
the 0 328 51
city, 0 328 51
and 0 328 51
then 0 328 51
"the 1 328 51
LORD 1 328 51

down 1 328 51

of 0 328 51

all 0 328 52
those 0 328 52
living 0 328 52
in 0 328 52
the 0 328 52
cities..." 0 328 52
(Genesis 0 328 52
19:2 0 328 52
4) 0 328 52
. 0 328 52

In 0 328 53
light 0 328 53
of 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
passage, 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
most 0 328 53
common 0 328 53
response 0 328 53
to 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
question, 0 328 53
"What 0 328 53
was 0 328 53
the 0 328 53
sin 0 328 53
of 0 328 53
Sodom 0 328 53
and 0 328 53
Gomorrah?" 0 328 53

is 0 328 54
that 0 328 54
it 0 328 54
was 0 328 54
homosexuality. 0 328 54

That 0 328 55
is 0 328 55
how 0 328 55
the 0 328 55
term 0 328 55
”sodomy” 0 328 55
came 0 328 55
to 0 328 55
be 0 328 55
used 0 328 55
to 0 328 55
refer 0 328 55
to 0 328 55
anal 0 328 55
sex 0 328 55
between 0 328 55
two 0 328 55
men, 0 328 55
whether 0 328 55
consensual 0 328 55
or 0 328 55
forced. 0 328 55

Clearly, 0 328 56
homosexuality 0 328 56
was 0 328 56
part 0 328 56
of 0 328 56
the 0 328 56
reason 0 328 56
God 0 328 56
destroyed 0 328 56
the 0 328 56
two 0 328 56
cities. 0 328 56

The 0 328 57
men 0 328 57
of 0 328 57
Sodom 0 328 57
and 0 328 57
Gomorrah 0 328 57
wanted 1 328 57
to 1 328 57
perform 1 328 57
homosexual 1 328 57
gang 1 328 57
rape 1 328 57
on 1 328 57
the 1 328 57
two 1 328 57
angels, 1 328 57
who 0 328 57
were 0 328 57
disguised 0 328 57
as 0 328 57
men. 0 328 57

At 0 328 58
the 0 328 58
same 0 328 58
time, 0 328 58
it 0 328 58
is 0 328 58
not 0 328 58
biblical 0 328 58
to 0 328 58
say 0 328 58
that 0 328 58
homosexuality 0 328 58
was 0 328 58
the 0 328 58
exclusive 0 328 58
reason 0 328 58
why 0 328 58
God 0 328 58
destroyed 0 328 58
Sodom 0 328 58
and 0 328 58
Gomorrah. 0 328 58

The 0 328 59
cities 0 328 59
of 0 328 59
Sodom 0 328 59
and 0 328 59
Gomorrah 0 328 59
were 0 328 59
definitely 0 328 59
not 0 328 59
exclusive 0 328 59
in 0 328 59
terms 0 328 59
of 0 328 59
the 0 328 59
sins 0 328 59
in 0 328 59
which 0 328 59
they 0 328 59
indulged. 0 328 59

Ezekiel 0 328 60
16:49-50 0 328 60
declares, 0 328 60
"Now 0 328 60
this 0 328 60
was 0 328 60
the 0 328 60
sin 0 328 60
of 0 328 60
your 0 328 60
sister 0 328 60
Sodom: 0 328 60
She 1 328 60
and 1 328 60
her 1 328 60
daughters 1 328 60
were 1 328 60
arrogant, 1 328 60
overfed 1 328 60
and 1 328 60
unconcerned; 1 328 60
they 1 328 60
did 1 328 60
not 1 328 60
help 1 328 60
the 1 328 60
poor 1 328 60
and 1 328 60
needy. 1 328 60

They 1 328 61
were 1 328 61
haughty 1 328 61
and 1 328 61
did 1 328 61
detestable 1 328 61
things 1 328 61
before 1 328 61
me..." 0 328 61
The 0 328 61
Hebrew 0 328 61
word 0 328 61
translated 0 328 61
"detestable" 0 328 61
refers 0 328 61
to 0 328 61
something 0 328 61
that 0 328 61
is 0 328 61
morally 1 328 61
disgusting 1 328 61
and 0 328 61
is 0 328 61
the 0 328 61
exact 0 328 61
same 0 328 61
word 0 328 61
used 0 328 61
in 0 328 61
Leviticus 0 328 61
18:22 0 328 61
that 0 328 61
refers 0 328 61
to 0 328 61
homosexuality 0 328 61
as 0 328 61
an 0 328 61
"abomination." 1 328 61

Similarly, 0 328 62
Jude 0 328 62
7 0 328 62
declares, 0 328 62
"...Sodom 0 328 62
and 0 328 62
Gomorrah 0 328 62
and 0 328 62
the 0 328 62
surrounding 0 328 62
towns 0 328 62
gave 1 328 62
themselves 1 328 62
up 1 328 62
to 1 328 62
sexual 1 328 62
immorality 1 328 62
and 1 328 62
perversion." 1 328 62

So, 0 328 63
again, 0 328 63
while 0 328 63
homosexuality 0 328 63
was 0 328 63
not 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
only 0 328 63
sin 0 328 63
in 0 328 63
which 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
cities 0 328 63
of 0 328 63
Sodom 0 328 63
and 0 328 63
Gomorrah 0 328 63
indulged, 0 328 63
it 0 328 63
does 0 328 63
appear 0 328 63
to 0 328 63
be 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
primary 0 328 63
reason 0 328 63
for 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
destruction 0 328 63
of 0 328 63
the 0 328 63
cities. 0 328 63

Those 0 328 64
who 0 328 64
attempt 0 328 64
to 0 328 64
explain 0 328 64
away 0 328 64
the 0 328 64
biblical 0 328 64
condemnations 0 328 64
of 0 328 64
homosexuality 0 328 64
claim 0 328 64
that 0 328 64
the 0 328 64
sin 0 328 64
of 0 328 64
Sodom 0 328 64
and 0 328 64
Gomorrah 0 328 64
was 0 328 64
inhospitality. 0 328 64

The 0 328 65
men 0 328 65
of 0 328 65
Sodom 0 328 65
and 0 328 65
Gomorrah 0 328 65
were 0 328 65
certainly 0 328 65
being 0 328 65
inhospitable. 0 328 65

There 1 328 66
is 1 328 66
probably 1 328 66
nothing 1 328 66
more 1 328 66
inhospitable 1 328 66
than 1 328 66
homosexual 1 328 66
gang 1 328 66
rape. 1 328 66

But 0 328 67
to 0 328 67
say 0 328 67
God 0 328 67
completely 0 328 67
destroyed 0 328 67
two 0 328 67
cities 0 328 67
and 0 328 67
all 0 328 67
their 0 328 67
inhabitants 0 328 67
for 0 328 67
being 0 328 67
inhospitable 0 328 67
clearly 0 328 67
misses 0 328 67
the 0 328 67
point. 0 328 67

While 0 328 68
Sodom 0 328 68
and 0 328 68
Gomorrah 0 328 68
were 0 328 68
guilty 0 328 68
of 0 328 68
many 0 328 68
other 0 328 68
horrendous 1 328 68
sins, 1 328 68
homosexuality 1 328 68
was 1 328 68
the 1 328 68
reason 1 328 68
God 1 328 68
poured 1 328 68
fiery 1 328 68
sulfur 1 328 68
on 1 328 68
the 1 328 68
cities, 1 328 68
completely 1 328 68
destroying 1 328 68
them 1 328 68
and 1 328 68
all 1 328 68
of 1 328 68
their 1 328 68
inhabitants. 1 328 68

To 0 328 69
this 0 328 69
day, 0 328 69
the 0 328 69
area 0 328 69
where 0 328 69
Sodom 0 328 69
and 0 328 69
Gomorrah 0 328 69
were 0 328 69
located 0 328 69
remains 0 328 69
a 0 328 69
desolate 0 328 69
wasteland. 0 328 69

Sodom 1 328 70
and 1 328 70
Gomorrah 1 328 70
serve 1 328 70
as 1 328 70
a 1 328 70
powerful 1 328 70
example 1 328 70
of 1 328 70
how 1 328 70
God 1 328 70
feels 1 328 70
about 1 328 70
sin 1 328 70
in 1 328 70
general, 1 328 70
and 1 328 70
homosexuality 1 328 70
specifically. 1 328 70

The 0 328 71
point 0 328 71
is 0 328 71
that 0 328 71
there 0 328 71
were 0 328 71
no 0 328 71
righteous 1 328 71
to 0 328 71
be 0 328 71
spared 0 328 71
and 0 328 71
the 0 328 71
Lord 0 328 71
did 0 328 71
what 0 328 71
man 0 328 71
failed 0 328 71
to 0 328 71
do 0 328 71
when 0 328 71
they 0 328 71
had 0 328 71
the 0 328 71
time 0 328 71
to 0 328 71
do 0 328 71
it. 0 328 71

Question: 0 328 72
How 1 328 72
do 1 328 72
you 1 328 72
show 1 328 72
mercy 1 328 72
to 1 328 72
a 1 328 72
people 1 328 72
who 1 328 72
observe 1 328 72
lying 1 328 72
vanities 1 328 72
(Jonah 1 328 72
2:4) 1 328 72
and 1 328 72
refuse 1 328 72
to 1 328 72
return 1 328 72
to 1 328 72
the 1 328 72
Lord 1 328 72
(Jeremiah 1 328 72
6:16) 1 328 72
on 1 328 72
His 1 328 72
terms? 1 328 72

(Jeremiah 0 328 73
22:3) 0 328 73
God 0 328 73
must 0 328 73
be 0 328 73
true 0 328 73
and 0 328 73
judgment 0 328 73
must 0 328 73
commence. 0 328 73

Men 0 328 74
today, 0 328 74
like 0 328 74
those 0 328 74
of 0 328 74
Sodom 0 328 74
and 0 328 74
Gomorrah, 0 328 74
are 0 328 74
not 0 328 74
valiant 0 328 74
for 0 328 74
the 0 328 74
truth. 0 328 74

They 0 328 75
are 0 328 75
valiant 0 328 75
to 0 328 75
proceed 0 328 75
from 0 328 75
evil 0 328 75
to 0 328 75
evil 0 328 75
(Jeremiah 0 328 75
5). 0 328 75

They 0 328 76
care 0 328 76
more 0 328 76
about 0 328 76
the 0 328 76
pleasures 0 328 76
of 0 328 76
sin 0 328 76
for 0 328 76
a 0 328 76
season, 0 328 76
than 0 328 76
they 0 328 76
are 0 328 76
grieved 0 328 76
for 0 328 76
the 0 328 76
afflictions 0 328 76
of 0 328 76
Joseph 0 328 76
(Amos 0 328 76
6:6; 0 328 76
Hebrews 0 328 76
11:25). 0 328 76

Men 0 328 77
today 0 328 77
care 0 328 77
more 0 328 77
of 0 328 77
compromise 0 328 77
(where 0 328 77
two 0 328 77
men 0 328 77
both 0 328 77
agree 0 328 77
on 0 328 77
what 0 328 77
they 0 328 77
both 0 328 77
know 0 328 77
is 0 328 77
wrong) 0 328 77
and 0 328 77
diplomacy 0 328 77
(seduction 0 328 77
in 0 328 77
another 0 328 77
guise) 0 328 77
in 0 328 77
promoting 0 328 77
anarchy 0 328 77
through 0 328 77
“antinomianism” 0 328 77
than 0 328 77
they 0 328 77
do 0 328 77
the 0 328 77
Law 0 328 77
of 0 328 77
God 0 328 77
against 0 328 77
the 0 328 77
sins 0 328 77
unto 0 328 77
judgment 0 328 77
that 0 328 77
enslave 0 328 77
men 0 328 77
(John 0 328 77
8:34). 0 328 77

Instead 0 328 78
of 0 328 78
establishing 0 328 78
judgment 0 328 78
within 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
gate 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
hating 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
evil 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
loving 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
good 0 328 78
(Amos 0 328 78
5:15) 0 328 78
in 0 328 78
hopes 0 328 78
that 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
Lord 0 328 78
may 0 328 78
be 0 328 78
gracious 0 328 78
to 0 328 78
their 0 328 78
repentance 0 328 78
(2 0 328 78
Corinthians 0 328 78
7:10), 0 328 78
they 0 328 78
reject 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
counsel 0 328 78
of 0 328 78
God 0 328 78
against 0 328 78
them 0 328 78
by 0 328 78
hating 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
good 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
loving 0 328 78
the 0 328 78
evil, 0 328 78
and 0 328 78
that 0 328 78
to 0 328 78
their 0 328 78
own 0 328 78
damnation. 0 328 78

They 1 328 79
care 1 328 79
more 0 328 79
about 0 328 79
the 0 328 79
approbation 0 328 79
and 0 328 79
favor 0 328 79
of 0 328 79
men 0 328 79
than 0 328 79
they 0 328 79
do 0 328 79
that 0 328 79
of 0 328 79
the 0 328 79
Living 0 328 79
God 0 328 79
and 0 328 79
what 0 328 79
His 0 328 79
Word 0 328 79
declares 0 328 79
(Galatians 0 328 79
1:10),not 0 328 79
knowing 0 328 79
that 0 328 79
which 0 328 79
his 0 328 79
highly 0 328 79
favored 0 328 79
among 0 328 79
men 0 328 79
is 0 328 79
an 0 328 79
abomination 0 328 79
unto 0 328 79
the 0 328 79
Lord 0 328 79
(Luke 0 328 79
16:15). 0 328 79

They 0 328 80
wear 0 328 80
the 0 328 80
cross. 0 328 80

Yet, 0 328 81
they 0 328 81
have 0 328 81
no 0 328 81
testimony 0 328 81
of 0 328 81
the 0 328 81
power 0 328 81
of 0 328 81
God 0 328 81
unto 0 328 81
salvation 0 328 81
by 0 328 81
the 0 328 81
cross 0 328 81
because 0 328 81
they 0 328 81
do 0 328 81
not 0 328 81
practice 0 328 81
what 0 328 81
Christ 0 328 81
required: 0 328 81
“Deny 0 328 81
yourselves 0 328 81
and 0 328 81
take 0 328 81
up 0 328 81
your 0 328 81
cross 0 328 81
and 0 328 81
follow 0 328 81
Me” 0 328 81
(Matthew 0 328 81

Professed 1 328 82
Christians 1 328 82
in 1 328 82
America 1 328 82
today 1 328 82
talk 1 328 82
much 1 328 82
of 1 328 82
love 1 328 82
through 1 328 82
inaction, 1 328 82
and 1 328 82
yet 1 328 82
know 1 328 82
nothing 1 328 82
of 1 328 82
it 1 328 82
(1 1 328 82
John 1 328 82
3:18). 1 328 82

They 1 328 83
read 1 328 83
what 1 328 83
to 1 328 83
do, 1 328 83
but 1 328 83
do 1 328 83
it 1 328 83
not! 1 328 83

In 1 328 84
fact, 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
declare 1 328 84
and 1 328 84
proclaim 1 328 84
how 1 328 84
much 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
love 1 328 84
God, 1 328 84
and 1 328 84
yet 1 328 84
if 1 328 84
you 1 328 84
were 1 328 84
to 1 328 84
have 1 328 84
them 1 328 84
read 1 328 84
His 1 328 84
moral 1 328 84
law 1 328 84
and 1 328 84
look 1 328 84
to 1 328 84
their 1 328 84
own 1 328 84
lives, 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
would 1 328 84
find 1 328 84
how 1 328 84
much 1 328 84
they 1 328 84
actually 1 328 84
hate 1 328 84
God 1 328 84
through 1 328 84
their 1 328 84
actions 1 328 84
(Matthew 1 328 84
15:8). 1 328 84

Then 0 328 85
again, 0 328 85
these 0 328 85
were 0 328 85
the 0 328 85
same 0 328 85
types 0 328 85
of 0 328 85
people 0 328 85
in 0 328 85
Jerusalem 0 328 85
crying 0 328 85
out 0 328 85
"Crucify 0 328 85
him! 0 328 85

Crucify 0 328 86
him! 0 328 86

We 0 328 87
have 0 328 87
no 0 328 87
king 0 328 87
but 0 328 87
Caesar" 0 328 87
(John 0 328 87
19:15). 0 328 87

And 0 328 88
these 0 328 88
are 0 328 88
the 0 328 88
same 0 328 88
people 0 328 88
today 0 328 88
persecuting 0 328 88
living 0 328 88
Christians 0 328 88
while 0 328 88
praising 0 328 88
the 0 328 88
dead 0 328 88
ones 0 328 88
(Matthew 0 328 88
5:10). 0 328 88

They 0 328 89
continuously 0 328 89
preach 0 328 89
of 0 328 89
the 0 328 89
heroism 0 328 89
of 0 328 89
Abraham, 0 328 89
Moses, 0 328 89
Joshua, 0 328 89
David, 0 328 89
Gideon, 0 328 89
Samson 0 328 89
and 0 328 89
others 0 328 89
from 0 328 89
the 0 328 89
pulpit 0 328 89
and 0 328 89
fail 0 328 89
to 0 328 89
understand 0 328 89
what 0 328 89
these 0 328 89
men 0 328 89
were 0 328 89
doing 0 328 89
when 0 328 89
serving 0 328 89
their 0 328 89
generations 0 328 89
(Psalm 0 328 89
71:18-19; 0 328 89
Isaiah 0 328 89
51:4). 0 328 89

Today, 0 328 90
instead 0 328 90
of 0 328 90
doing 0 328 90
the 0 328 90
same, 0 328 90
they 0 328 90
simply 0 328 90
hide 0 328 90
under 0 328 90
a 0 328 90
false 0 328 90
grace 0 328 90
(Isaiah 0 328 90
30) 0 328 90
and 0 328 90
give 0 328 90
themselves 0 328 90
over 0 328 90
to 0 328 90
a 0 328 90
man, 0 328 90
the 0 328 90
president, 0 328 90
and 0 328 90
declare 0 328 90
end 0 328 90
times. 0 328 90

They 0 328 91
declare 0 328 91
we're 0 328 91
in 0 328 91
the 0 328 91
end 0 328 91
times 0 328 91
because 0 328 91
they 0 328 91
have 0 328 91
failed 0 328 91
to 0 328 91
stand 0 328 91
up 0 328 91
and 0 328 91
fight 0 328 91
for 0 328 91
their 0 328 91
posterity 0 328 91
in 0 328 91
keeping 0 328 91
the 0 328 91
Lord's 0 328 91
commandments 0 328 91
and 0 328 91
His 0 328 91
judgments 0 328 91
(Psalm 0 328 91
78:1-11). 0 328 91

Ungrateful 1 328 92
reprobates, 1 328 92
pretenders, 1 328 92
counterfeits 1 328 92
and 1 328 92
hypocrites 1 328 92
are 0 328 92
what 0 328 92
they 0 328 92
are 0 328 92
(Matthew 0 328 92
23:3). 0 328 92

Instead 1 328 93
of 1 328 93
reaching 1 328 93
out 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
the 1 328 93
greatest 1 328 93
demographic 1 328 93
here 1 328 93
in 1 328 93
America, 1 328 93
public 1 328 93
high 1 328 93
schools, 1 328 93
they 1 328 93
send 1 328 93
missionaries 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
foreign 1 328 93
lands 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
do 1 328 93
there 1 328 93
what 1 328 93
they 1 328 93
fail 1 328 93
to 1 328 93
do 1 328 93
for 1 328 93
their 1 328 93
own 1 328 93
here. 1 328 93

Instead 1 328 94
of 1 328 94
fighting 1 328 94
for 1 328 94
their 1 328 94
posterity 1 328 94
and 1 328 94
shutting 1 328 94
down 1 328 94
the 1 328 94
illegalities 1 328 94
of 1 328 94
sodomy 1 328 94
in 1 328 94
all 1 328 94
50 1 328 94
states, 1 328 94
they 1 328 94
teach 1 328 94
them 1 328 94
to 1 328 94
just 1 328 94
do 1 328 94
their 1 328 94
best 1 328 94
to 1 328 94
understand 1 328 94
that 1 328 94
they 1 328 94
cannot 1 328 94
help 1 328 94
themselves 1 328 94
while 1 328 94
God 1 328 94
say’s 1 328 94
the 1 328 94
opposite 1 328 94
(Leviticus 1 328 94
20:18). 1 328 94

Instead 1 328 95
of 1 328 95
fighting 1 328 95
on 1 328 95
their 1 328 95
behalf 1 328 95
against 1 328 95
the 1 328 95
federal 1 328 95
government 1 328 95
that 1 328 95
is 1 328 95
illegally 1 328 95
indoctrinating 1 328 95
them, 1 328 95
they 1 328 95
simply 1 328 95
give 1 328 95
their 1 328 95
kids 1 328 95
over 1 328 95
to 1 328 95
them 1 328 95
to 1 328 95
be 1 328 95
dumbed 1 328 95
down. 1 328 95

And 1 328 96
instead 1 328 96
of 1 328 96
protesting 1 328 96
the 1 328 96
murder 1 328 96
of 1 328 96
58 1 328 96
million 1 328 96
innocent 1 328 96
babies 1 328 96
(Proverbs 1 328 96
6:17), 1 328 96
they 1 328 96
merely 1 328 96
pass 1 328 96
it 1 328 96
off 1 328 96
as 1 328 96
a 1 328 96
"choice," 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
being 1 328 96
the 1 328 96
lessons 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
they 1 328 96
learned 1 328 96
from 1 328 96
the 1 328 96
media 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
they 1 328 96
say 1 328 96
that 1 328 96
they 1 328 96
do 1 328 96
not 1 328 96
believe 1 328 96
(Romans 1 328 96
1:18). 1 328 96

The 1 328 97
American 1 328 97
Church, 1 328 97
instead 1 328 97
of 1 328 97
protesting 1 328 97
corruption 1 328 97
in 1 328 97
government 1 328 97
through 1 328 97
the 1 328 97
example 1 328 97
of 1 328 97
the 1 328 97
Biblical 1 328 97
patriarchs 1 328 97
and 1 328 97
our 1 328 97
American 1 328 97
forefathers 1 328 97
(Matthew 1 328 97
5:17-18), 1 328 97
teach 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
submit 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
tyranny 1 328 97
as 1 328 97
if 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
suggest 1 328 97
that 1 328 97
it 1 328 97
is 1 328 97
somehow 1 328 97
obedience 1 328 97
to 1 328 97
God 1 328 97
(Romans 1 328 97
12:21). 1 328 97

The 1 328 98
Church 1 328 98
in 1 328 98
America 1 328 98
has 1 328 98
failed 1 328 98
to 1 328 98
keep 1 328 98
the 1 328 98
Commandments 1 328 98
of 1 328 98
the 1 328 98
God 1 328 98
of 1 328 98
Israel. 1 328 98

Instead 1 328 99
of 1 328 99
preaching 1 328 99
out 1 328 99
against 1 328 99
sin, 1 328 99
they 1 328 99
advocate 1 328 99
for 1 328 99
that 1 328 99
which 1 328 99
God 1 328 99
clearly 1 328 99
condemns, 1 328 99
thereby 1 328 99
making 1 328 99
war 1 328 99
against 1 328 99
God 1 328 99
(Micah 1 328 99
3:5), 1 328 99
which 1 328 99
at 1 328 99
length 1 328 99
destroys 1 328 99
our 1 328 99
government, 1 328 99
our 1 328 99
country 1 328 99
and 1 328 99
our 1 328 99
families. 1 328 99

Look 1 328 100
to 1 328 100
their 1 328 100
feigned 1 328 100
strength 1 328 100
that 1 328 100
they 1 328 100
profess 1 328 100
to 1 328 100
possess. 1 328 100

It 1 328 101
is 1 328 101
gauged 1 328 101
by 1 328 101
simply 1 328 101
looking 1 328 101
to 1 328 101
the 1 328 101
prevailing 1 328 101
immoralities 1 328 101
and 1 328 101
debauchers 1 328 101
of 1 328 101
society. 1 328 101

They 1 328 102
are 1 328 102
weak 1 328 102
and 1 328 102
pathetic 1 328 102
and 1 328 102
they 1 328 102
have 1 328 102
no 1 328 102
excuses 1 328 102
as 1 328 102
to 1 328 102
why 1 328 102
America 1 328 102
is 1 328 102
where 1 328 102
we 1 328 102
is 1 328 102
today! 1 328 102

Why 0 328 103
did 0 328 103
God 0 328 103
judge 0 328 103
Sodom 0 328 103
and 0 328 103
Gomorrah? 0 328 103

It's 1 328 104
the 1 328 104
same 1 328 104
reason 1 328 104
that 1 328 104
he 1 328 104
is 1 328 104
judging 1 328 104
America 1 328 104
today 1 328 104
(Amos 1 328 104
4:12), 1 328 104
He 1 328 104
cannot 1 328 104
find 1 328 104
the 1 328 104
righteous 1 328 104
in 1 328 104
order 1 328 104
to 1 328 104
spare 1 328 104
her 1 328 104
(Jeremiah 0 328 104
22:3). 0 328 104

Defining 0 328 105
the 1 328 105
Wicked… 1 328 105

Wicked 0 328 106
men 0 328 106
in 0 328 106
the 0 328 106
sight 0 328 106
of 0 328 106
God 0 328 106
are 0 328 106
those 0 328 106
who 0 328 106
have 0 328 106

to 0 331 12
the 0 331 12
United 0 331 12
States 0 331 12
has 0 331 12
accused 0 331 12
Francis 0 331 12
of 0 331 12
repealing 0 331 12
sanctions 0 331 12
imposed 0 331 12
by 0 331 12
Pope 0 331 12
Benedict 0 331 12
XVI 0 331 12
on 0 331 12
then-Cardinal 0 331 12
McCarrick 0 331 12
for 0 331 12
sexual 0 331 12
abuse. 0 331 12

This 0 331 13
is 0 331 13
a 0 331 13
charge 0 331 13
most 1 331 13
serious, 1 331 13
perhaps 0 331 13
without 0 331 13
precedent 0 331 13
in 0 331 13
modern 0 331 13
times. 0 331 13

Bishops 0 331 14
and 0 331 14
priests, 0 331 14
abusing 0 331 14
their 0 331 14
authority, 0 331 14
have 0 331 14
committed 0 331 14
horrendous 1 331 14
crimes 0 331 14
to 0 331 14
the 0 331 14
detriment 0 331 14
of 0 331 14
their 0 331 14
faithful, 0 331 14
minors, 0 331 14
innocent 0 331 14
victims, 0 331 14

eager 0 331 14
to 0 331 14
offer 0 331 14
their 0 331 14
lives 0 331 14
to 0 331 14
the 0 331 14
Church, 0 331 14
or 0 331 14
by 0 331 14
their 0 331 14
silence 0 331 14
have 0 331 14
not 0 331 14
prevented 0 331 14
that 0 331 14
such 0 331 14
crimes 0 331 14
continue 0 331 14
to 0 331 14
be 0 331 14
perpetrated. 0 331 14

To 0 331 15
restore 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
beauty 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
holiness 0 331 15
to 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
face 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
Bride 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
Christ, 0 331 15
which 0 331 15
is 0 331 15
terribly 1 331 15
disfigured 1 331 15
by 0 331 15
so 0 331 15
many 0 331 15
abominable 1 331 15
crimes, 1 331 15
and 0 331 15
if 0 331 15
we 0 331 15
truly 0 331 15
want 0 331 15
to 0 331 15
free 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
Church 0 331 15
from 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
fetid 0 331 15
swamp 0 331 15
into 0 331 15
which 0 331 15
she 0 331 15
has 0 331 15
fallen, 0 331 15
we 0 331 15
must 0 331 15
have 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
courage 0 331 15
to 0 331 15
tear 0 331 15
down 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
culture 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
secrecy 0 331 15
and 0 331 15
publicly 0 331 15
confess 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
truths 0 331 15
we 0 331 15
have 0 331 15
kept 0 331 15
hidden. 0 331 15

We 1 331 16
must 1 331 16
tear 0 331 16
down 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
conspiracy 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
silence 0 331 16
with 0 331 16
which 0 331 16
bishops 0 331 16
and 0 331 16
priests 0 331 16
have 0 331 16
protected 0 331 16
themselves 0 331 16
at 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
expense 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
their 0 331 16
faithful, 0 331 16
a 0 331 16
conspiracy 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
silence 0 331 16
that 0 331 16
in 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
eyes 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
world 0 331 16
risks 0 331 16
making 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
Church 0 331 16
look 0 331 16
like 0 331 16
a 0 331 16
sect, 0 331 16
a 0 331 16
conspiracy 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
silence 0 331 16
not 0 331 16
so 0 331 16
dissimilar 0 331 16
from 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
one 0 331 16
that 0 331 16
prevails 0 331 16
in 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
mafia. 0 331 16

“Whatever 0 331 17
you 0 331 17
have 0 331 17
said 0 331 17
in 0 331 17
the 0 331 17
dark 0 331 17
... 0 331 17
shall 0 331 17
be 0 331 17
proclaimed 0 331 17
from 0 331 17
the 0 331 17
housetops” 0 331 17
(Lk. 0 331 17

12:3). 0 331 18

I 0 331 19
had 0 331 19
always 0 331 19
believed 0 331 19
and 0 331 19
hoped 0 331 19
that 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
hierarchy 0 331 19
of 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
Church 0 331 19
could 0 331 19
find 0 331 19
within 0 331 19
itself 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
spiritual 0 331 19
resources 0 331 19
and 0 331 19
strength 0 331 19
to 0 331 19
tell 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
whole 0 331 19
truth, 0 331 19
to 0 331 19
amend 0 331 19
and 0 331 19
to 0 331 19
renew 0 331 19
itself. 0 331 19

That 0 331 20
is 0 331 20
why, 0 331 20
even 0 331 20
though 0 331 20
I 0 331 20
had 0 331 20
repeatedly 0 331 20
been 0 331 20
asked 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
do 0 331 20
so, 0 331 20
I 0 331 20
always 0 331 20
avoided 0 331 20
making 0 331 20
statements 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
the 0 331 20
media, 0 331 20
even 0 331 20
when 0 331 20
it 0 331 20
would 0 331 20
have 0 331 20
been 0 331 20
my 0 331 20
right 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
do 0 331 20
so, 0 331 20
in 0 331 20
order 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
defend 0 331 20
myself 0 331 20
against 0 331 20
the 0 331 20
calumnies 0 331 20
published 0 331 20
about 0 331 20
me, 0 331 20
even 0 331 20
by 0 331 20
high-ranking 0 331 20
prelates 0 331 20
of 0 331 20
the 0 331 20
Roman 0 331 20
Curia. 0 331 20

But 0 331 21
now 0 331 21
that 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
corruption 0 331 21
has 0 331 21
reached 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
very 0 331 21
top 0 331 21
of 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
Church’s 0 331 21
hierarchy, 0 331 21
my 0 331 21
conscience 0 331 21
dictates 0 331 21
that 0 331 21
I 0 331 21
reveal 0 331 21
those 0 331 21
truths 0 331 21
regarding 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
heart-breaking 0 331 21
case 0 331 21
of 0 331 21

in 0 331 21

Representations 0 331 22

my 0 331 22

the 0 331 22

To 0 331 24
dispel 0 331 24
suspicions 0 331 24
insinuated 0 331 24
in 0 331 24
several 0 331 24
recent 0 331 24

I 0 331 24
will 0 331 24
immediately 0 331 24
say 0 331 24
that 0 331 24
the 0 331 24
Apostolic 0 331 24
Nuncios 0 331 24
in 0 331 24

Gabriel 0 331 24

Pietro 0 331 24
Sambi, 0 331 24
both 0 331 24
prematurely 0 331 24
deceased, 0 331 24
did 0 331 24
not 0 331 24
fail 0 331 24
to 0 331 24
inform 0 331 24
the 0 331 24
Holy 0 331 24
See 0 331 24
immediately, 0 331 24
as 0 331 24
soon 0 331 24
as 0 331 24
they 0 331 24
learned 0 331 24
of 0 331 24
Archbishop 0 331 24
McCarrick’s 0 331 24
gravely 1 331 24
immoral 1 331 24
behavior 1 331 24
with 0 331 24

Indeed, 0 331 25
according 0 331 25
to 0 331 25
what 0 331 25
Nuncio 0 331 25

In 0 331 26
the 0 331 26

Father 0 331 26
Ramsey, 0 331 26
who 0 331 26
had 0 331 26
been 0 331 26
a 0 331 26
professor 0 331 26
at 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
diocesan 0 331 26
seminary 0 331 26
in 0 331 26
Newark 0 331 26
from 0 331 26
the 0 331 26

of 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
’80s 0 331 26
until 0 331 26
1996, 0 331 26
affirms 0 331 26
that 0 331 26
there 0 331 26
was 0 331 26
a 0 331 26
recurring 0 331 26
rumor 0 331 26
in 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
seminary 0 331 26
that 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
Archbishop 0 331 26
“shared 0 331 26
his 0 331 26
bed 0 331 26

seminarians,” 0 331 26
inviting 0 331 26
five 0 331 26

a 0 331 26
time 0 331 26
to 0 331 26

him 0 331 26
at 0 331 26
his 0 331 26
beach 0 331 26
house. 0 331 26

And 0 331 27
he 0 331 27
added 0 331 27
that 0 331 27
he 0 331 27
knew 0 331 27
a 0 331 27
certain 0 331 27
number 0 331 27
of 0 331 27
seminarians, 0 331 27
some 0 331 27
of 0 331 27
whom 0 331 27
were 0 331 27

for 0 331 27
the 0 331 27

this 0 331 27

Indictment 0 331 29

Charlotte, 0 331 29
who 0 331 29
was 0 331 29
reduced 0 331 29
to 0 331 29
the 0 331 29
lay 0 331 29
state 0 331 29
for 0 331 29
a 0 331 29
violation 0 331 29
of 0 331 29
minors, 0 331 29
together 0 331 29
with 0 331 29
two 0 331 29
documents 0 331 29
from 0 331 29
the 0 331 29
same 0 331 29
Littleton, 0 331 29
in 0 331 29
which 0 331 29
he 0 331 29
recounted 0 331 29
his 0 331 29
tragic 1 331 29
story 0 331 29
of 0 331 29
sexual 0 331 29
abuse 0 331 29
by 0 331 29
the 0 331 29
then-Archbishop 0 331 29
of 0 331 29
Newark 0 331 29
and 0 331 29
several 0 331 29
other 0 331 29

seminarians. 0 331 29

The 0 331 30
Nuncio 0 331 30
added 0 331 30
that 0 331 30
Littleton 0 331 30
had 0 331 30
already 0 331 30
forwarded 0 331 30
his 0 331 30
Memorandum 0 331 30
to 0 331 30
about 0 331 30
twenty 0 331 30
people, 0 331 30
including 0 331 30
civil 0 331 30
and 0 331 30
ecclesiastical 0 331 30
judicial 0 331 30
authorities, 0 331 30
police 0 331 30

lawyers, 0 331 30
in 0 331 30
June 0 331 30
2006, 0 331 30
and 0 331 30
that 0 331 30
it 0 331 30
was 0 331 30
therefore 0 331 30
very 0 331 30
likely 0 331 30
that 0 331 30
the 0 331 30
news 0 331 30
would 0 331 30
soon 0 331 30
be 0 331 30
made 0 331 30
public. 0 331 30

He 0 331 31
therefore 0 331 31
called 0 331 31
for 0 331 31
a 0 331 31
prompt 0 331 31

that 0 331 34
it 0 331 34
seemed 0 331 34
a 0 331 34
new 0 331 34

of 0 331 34
particular 0 331 34

as 0 331 34

and 0 331 35
that, 0 331 35
since 0 331 35
this 0 331 35
matter 0 331 35
had 0 331 35
to 0 331 35

a 0 331 35
cardinal, 0 331 35

- 0 331 38
I 0 331 38
proposed 0 331 38
that 0 331 38
an 0 331 38
exemplary 0 331 38
measure 0 331 38
be 0 331 38
taken 0 331 38
against 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
Cardinal 0 331 38
that 0 331 38
could 0 331 38
have 0 331 38
a 0 331 38
medicinal 0 331 38
function, 0 331 38
to 0 331 38
prevent 0 331 38
future 0 331 38
abuses 0 331 38
against 0 331 38
innocent 0 331 38
victims 0 331 38
and 0 331 38
alleviate 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
very 0 331 38
serious 0 331 38
scandal 0 331 38
for 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
faithful, 0 331 38
who 0 331 38
despite 0 331 38
everything 0 331 38
continued 0 331 38
to 0 331 38
love 0 331 38
and 0 331 38
believe 0 331 38
in 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
Church. 0 331 38

I 0 331 39
added 0 331 39
that 0 331 39
it 0 331 39
would 0 331 39
be 0 331 39
salutary 0 331 39
if, 0 331 39
for 0 331 39
once, 0 331 39
ecclesiastical 0 331 39
authority 0 331 39
would 0 331 39
intervene 0 331 39
before 0 331 39
the 0 331 39
civil 0 331 39
authorities 0 331 39
and, 0 331 39
if 0 331 39
possible, 0 331 39
before 0 331 39
the 0 331 39
scandal 0 331 39
had 0 331 39
broken 0 331 39
out 0 331 39
in 0 331 39
the 0 331 39
press. 0 331 39

This 0 331 40
could 0 331 40
have 0 331 40
restored 0 331 40
some 0 331 40
dignity 0 331 40
to 0 331 40
a 0 331 40
Church 0 331 40
so 0 331 40
sorely 0 331 40
tried 0 331 40
and 0 331 40
humiliated 0 331 40
by 0 331 40
so 0 331 40
many 0 331 40
abominable 0 331 40
acts 0 331 40
on 0 331 40
the 0 331 40
part 0 331 40
of 0 331 40
some 0 331 40
pastors. 0 331 40

If 0 331 41
this 0 331 41
were 0 331 41
done, 0 331 41
the 0 331 41
civil 0 331 41
authority 0 331 41
would 0 331 41
no 0 331 41
longer 0 331 41
have 0 331 41
to 0 331 41
judge 0 331 41
a 0 331 41
cardinal, 0 331 41
but 0 331 41
a 0 331 41
pastor 0 331 41
with 0 331 41
whom 0 331 41
the 0 331 41
Church 0 331 41
had 0 331 41
already 0 331 41
taken 0 331 41
appropriate 0 331 41
measures 0 331 41
to 0 331 41
prevent 0 331 41
the 0 331 41
cardinal 0 331 41
from 0 331 41
abusing 0 331 41
his 0 331 41
authority 0 331 41
and 0 331 41
continuing 0 331 41
to 0 331 41
destroy 1 331 41
innocent 0 331 41
victims. 0 331 41

of 0 331 42

2006. 0 331 46

In 0 331 47
it, 0 331 47
I 0 331 47
summarized 0 331 47
Richard 0 331 47

which 0 331 47
ended 0 331 47

heartfelt 0 331 47
appeal 0 331 47
to 0 331 47

“I 0 331 47

similar 0 331 48
and 0 331 48
as 0 331 48
great 0 331 48
now 0 331 48
in 0 331 48
the 0 331 48
United 0 331 48
States 0 331 48
as 0 331 48
they 0 331 48
were 0 331 48
then 0 331 48
in 0 331 48
Rome. 0 331 48

If 0 331 49
Your 0 331 49
Holiness 0 331 49
requests, 0 331 49
I 0 331 49
will 0 331 49
personally 0 331 49
submit 0 331 49
to 0 331 49
you 0 331 49
documentation 0 331 49
of 0 331 49
that 0 331 49
about 0 331 49
which 0 331 49
I 0 331 49
have 0 331 49
spoken.” 0 331 49

I 0 331 50
ended 0 331 50
my 0 331 50
memo 0 331 50
by 0 331 50
repeating 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
my 0 331 50
superiors 0 331 50
that 0 331 50
I 0 331 50
thought 0 331 50
it 0 331 50
was 0 331 50
necessary 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
intervene 0 331 50
as 0 331 50
soon 0 331 50
as 0 331 50
possible 0 331 50
by 0 331 50
removing 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
cardinal’s 0 331 50
hat 0 331 50
from 0 331 50
Cardinal 0 331 50
McCarrick 0 331 50
and 0 331 50
that 0 331 50
he 0 331 50
should 0 331 50
be 0 331 50
subjected 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
sanctions 0 331 50
established 0 331 50
by 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
Code 0 331 50
of 0 331 50
Canon 0 331 50
Law, 0 331 50
which 0 331 50
also 0 331 50
provide 0 331 50
for 0 331 50
reduction 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
lay 0 331 50
state. 0 331 50

This 0 331 51
second 0 331 51
memo 0 331 51
of 0 331 51
mine 0 331 51
was 0 331 51
also 0 331 51
never 0 331 51
returned 0 331 51
to 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
Personnel 0 331 51
Office, 0 331 51
and 0 331 51
I 0 331 51
was 0 331 51
greatly 1 331 51
dismayed 1 331 51
at 0 331 51
my 0 331 51
superiors 0 331 51
for 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
inconceivable 0 331 51
absence 0 331 51
of 0 331 51
any 0 331 51
measure 0 331 51
against 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
Cardinal, 0 331 51
and 0 331 51
for 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
continuing 0 331 51
lack 0 331 51
of 0 331 51
any 0 331 51
communication 0 331 51
with 0 331 51
me 0 331 51
since 0 331 51
my 0 331 51
first 0 331 51
memo 0 331 51
in 0 331 51
December 0 331 51
2006. 0 331 51

But 0 331 52
finally 0 331 52
I 0 331 52
learned 0 331 52
with 0 331 52
certainty, 0 331 52
through 0 331 52
Cardinal 0 331 52
Giovanni 0 331 52
Battista 0 331 52
Re, 0 331 52
then-Prefect 0 331 52
of 0 331 52
the 0 331 52
Congregation 0 331 52
for 0 331 52
Bishops, 0 331 52
that 0 331 52
Richard 0 331 52
Sipe’s 0 331 52
courageous 1 331 52
and 1 331 52
meritorious 1 331 52
Statement 0 331 52
had 0 331 52
had 0 331 52
the 0 331 52
desired 0 331 52
result. 0 331 52

Pope 0 331 53
Benedict 0 331 53
had 0 331 53
imposed 0 331 53
on 0 331 53
Cardinal 0 331 53
McCarrick 0 331 53
sanctions 0 331 53
similar 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
those 0 331 53
now 0 331 53
imposed 0 331 53
on 0 331 53
him 0 331 53
by 0 331 53
Pope 0 331 53
Francis: 0 331 53
the 0 331 53
Cardinal 0 331 53
was 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
leave 0 331 53
the 0 331 53
seminary 0 331 53
where 0 331 53
he 0 331 53
was 0 331 53
living, 0 331 53
he 0 331 53
was 0 331 53
forbidden 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
celebrate 0 331 53
[Mass] 0 331 53
in 0 331 53
public, 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
participate 0 331 53
in 0 331 53
public 0 331 53
meetings, 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
give 0 331 53
lectures, 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
travel, 0 331 53
with 0 331 53
the 0 331 53
obligation 0 331 53
of 0 331 53
dedicating 0 331 53
himself 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
a 0 331 53
life 0 331 53
of 0 331 53
prayer 0 331 53
and 0 331 53
penance. 0 331 53

I 0 331 54
do 0 331 54
not 0 331 54
know 0 331 54
when 0 331 54
Pope 0 331 54
Benedict 0 331 54
took 0 331 54
these 0 331 54
measures 0 331 54
against 0 331 54
McCarrick, 0 331 54
whether 0 331 54
in 0 331 54
2009 0 331 54
or 0 331 54
2010, 0 331 54
because 0 331 54
in 0 331 54
the 0 331 54
meantime 0 331 54
I 0 331 54
had 0 331 54
been 0 331 54
transferred 0 331 54
to 0 331 54
the 0 331 54
Governorate 0 331 54
of 0 331 54
Vatican 0 331 54
City 0 331 54
State, 0 331 54
just 0 331 54
as 0 331 54
I 0 331 54
do 0 331 54
not 0 331 54
know 0 331 54
who 0 331 54
was 0 331 54
responsible 0 331 54
for 0 331 54
this 0 331 54
incredible 1 331 54
delay. 0 331 54

I 0 331 55
certainly 0 331 55
do 0 331 55
not 0 331 55
believe 0 331 55
it 0 331 55
was 0 331 55
Pope 0 331 55
Benedict, 0 331 55
who 0 331 55
as 0 331 55
Cardinal 0 331 55
had 0 331 55
repeatedly 0 331 55
denounced 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
corruption 0 331 55
present 0 331 55
in 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
Church, 0 331 55
and 0 331 55
in 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
first 0 331 55
months 0 331 55
of 0 331 55
his 0 331 55
pontificate 0 331 55
had 0 331 55
already 0 331 55
taken 0 331 55
a 0 331 55
firm 0 331 55
stand 0 331 55
against 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
admission 0 331 55
into 0 331 55
seminary 0 331 55
of 0 331 55
young 0 331 55
men 0 331 55
with 0 331 55
deep 0 331 55
homosexual 0 331 55
tendencies. 0 331 55

I 0 331 56
believe 0 331 56
it 0 331 56
was 0 331 56
due 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
Pope’s 0 331 56
first 0 331 56
collaborator 0 331 56
at 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
time, 0 331 56
Cardinal 0 331 56
Tarcisio 0 331 56
Bertone, 0 331 56
who 0 331 56
notoriously 0 331 56
favored 0 331 56
promoting 0 331 56
homosexuals 0 331 56
into 0 331 56
positions 0 331 56
of 0 331 56
responsibility, 0 331 56
and 0 331 56
was 0 331 56
accustomed 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
managing 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
information 0 331 56
he 0 331 56
thought 0 331 56
appropriate 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
convey 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
Pope. 0 331 56

In 0 331 57
any 0 331 57
case, 0 331 57
what 0 331 57
is 0 331 57
certain 0 331 57
is 0 331 57
that 0 331 57
Pope 0 331 57
Benedict 0 331 57
imposed 0 331 57
the 0 331 57
above 0 331 57
canonical 0 331 57
sanctions 0 331 57
on 0 331 57
McCarrick 0 331 57
and 0 331 57
that 0 331 57
they 0 331 57
were 0 331 57
communicated 0 331 57
to 0 331 57
him 0 331 57
by 0 331 57
the 0 331 57
Apostolic 0 331 57
Nuncio 0 331 57
to 0 331 57
the 0 331 57
United 0 331 57
States, 0 331 57
Pietro 0 331 57
Sambi. 0 331 57

Monsignor 0 331 58
Jean-François 0 331 58
Lantheaume, 0 331 58
then 0 331 58
first 0 331 58
Counsellor 0 331 58
of 0 331 58
the 0 331 58
Nunciature 0 331 58
in 0 331 58
Washington 0 331 58
and 0 331 58
Chargé 0 331 58
d'Affaires 0 331 58
a.i. 0 331 58

after 0 331 59
the 0 331 59
unexpected 0 331 59
death 0 331 59
of 0 331 59
Nuncio 0 331 59
Sambi 0 331 59
in 0 331 59
Baltimore, 0 331 59
told 0 331 59
me 0 331 59
when 0 331 59
I 0 331 59
arrived 0 331 59
in 0 331 59
Washington 0 331 59
— 0 331 59
and 0 331 59
he 0 331 59
is 0 331 59
ready 0 331 59
to 0 331 59
testify 0 331 59
to 0 331 59
it— 0 331 59
about 0 331 59
a 0 331 59
stormy 0 331 59
conversation, 0 331 59
lasting 0 331 59
over 0 331 59
an 0 331 59
hour, 0 331 59
that 0 331 59
Nuncio 0 331 59
Sambi 0 331 59
had 0 331 59
with 0 331 59
Cardinal 0 331 59
McCarrick 0 331 59
whom 0 331 59
he 0 331 59
had 0 331 59
summoned 0 331 59
to 0 331 59
the 0 331 59
Nunciature. 0 331 59

Monsignor 0 331 60
Lantheaume 0 331 60
told 0 331 60
me 0 331 60
that 0 331 60
“the 0 331 60
Nuncio’s 0 331 60
voice 0 331 60
could 0 331 60
be 0 331 60
heard 0 331 60
all 0 331 60
the 0 331 60
way 0 331 60
out 0 331 60
in 0 331 60
the 0 331 60
corridor.” 0 331 60

Pope 0 331 61
Benedict’s 0 331 61
same 0 331 61
dispositions 0 331 61
were 0 331 61
then 0 331 61
also 0 331 61
communicated 0 331 61
to 0 331 61
me 0 331 61
by 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
new 0 331 61
Prefect 0 331 61
of 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
Congregation 0 331 61
for 0 331 61
Bishops, 0 331 61
Cardinal 0 331 61
Marc 0 331 61
Ouellet, 0 331 61
in 0 331 61
November 0 331 61
2011, 0 331 61
in 0 331 61
a 0 331 61
conversation 0 331 61
before 0 331 61
my 0 331 61
departure 0 331 61
for 0 331 61
Washington, 0 331 61
and 0 331 61
were 0 331 61
included 0 331 61
among 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
instructions 0 331 61
of 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
same 0 331 61
Congregation 0 331 61
to 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
new 0 331 61
Nuncio. 0 331 61

In 0 331 62
turn, 0 331 62
I 0 331 62
repeated 0 331 62
them 0 331 62
to 0 331 62
Cardinal 0 331 62
McCarrick 0 331 62
at 0 331 62
my 0 331 62
first 0 331 62
meeting 0 331 62
with 0 331 62
him 0 331 62
at 0 331 62
the 0 331 62
Nunciature. 0 331 62

The 0 331 63
Cardinal, 0 331 63
muttering 0 331 63
in 0 331 63
a 0 331 63
barely 0 331 63
comprehensible 0 331 63
way, 0 331 63
admitted 0 331 63
that 0 331 63
he 0 331 63
had 0 331 63
perhaps 0 331 63
made 0 331 63
the 0 331 63
mistake 0 331 63
of 0 331 63
sleeping 0 331 63
in 0 331 63
the 0 331 63
same 0 331 63
bed 0 331 63
with 0 331 63
some 0 331 63
seminarians 0 331 63
at 0 331 63
his 0 331 63
beach 0 331 63
house, 0 331 63
but 0 331 63
he 0 331 63
said 0 331 63
this 0 331 63
as 0 331 63
if 0 331 63
it 0 331 63
had 0 331 63
no 0 331 63
importance. 0 331 63

The 0 331 64
faithful 0 331 64
insistently 0 331 64
wonder 0 331 64
how 0 331 64
it 0 331 64
was 0 331 64
possible 0 331 64
for 0 331 64
him 0 331 64
to 0 331 64
be 0 331 64
appointed 0 331 64
to 0 331 64
Washington, 0 331 64
and 0 331 64
as 0 331 64
Cardinal, 0 331 64
and 0 331 64
they 0 331 64
have 0 331 64
every 0 331 64
right 0 331 64
to 0 331 64
know 0 331 64
who 0 331 64
knew, 0 331 64
and 0 331 64
who 0 331 64
covered 0 331 64
up 0 331 64
his 0 331 64
grave 1 331 64
misdeeds. 1 331 64

It 0 331 65
is 0 331 65
therefore 0 331 65
my 0 331 65
duty 0 331 65
to 0 331 65
reveal 0 331 65
what 0 331 65
I 0 331 65
know 0 331 65
about 0 331 65
this, 0 331 65
beginning 0 331 65
with 0 331 65
the 0 331 65
Roman 0 331 65
Curia. 0 331 65

Cardinal 0 331 66
Angelo 0 331 66
Sodano 0 331 66
was 0 331 66
Secretary 0 331 66
of 0 331 66
State 0 331 66
until 0 331 66
September 0 331 66
2006: 0 331 66
all 0 331 66
information 0 331 66
was 0 331 66
communicated 0 331 66
to 0 331 66
him. 0 331 66

In 0 331 67
November 0 331 67
2000, 0 331 67
Nunzio 0 331 67
Montalvo 0 331 67
sent 0 331 67
him 0 331 67
his 0 331 67
report, 0 331 67
passing 0 331 67
on 0 331 67
to 0 331 67
him 0 331 67
the 0 331 67
aforementioned 0 331 67
letter 0 331 67
from 0 331 67
Father 0 331 67
Boniface 0 331 67
Ramsey 0 331 67
in 0 331 67
which 0 331 67
he 0 331 67
denounced 0 331 67
the 0 331 67
serious 0 331 67
abuses 0 331 67
committed 0 331 67
by 0 331 67
McCarrick. 0 331 67

It 0 331 68
is 0 331 68
known 0 331 68
that 0 331 68
Sodano 0 331 68
tried 0 331 68
to 0 331 68
cover 0 331 68
up 0 331 68
the 0 331 68
Father 0 331 68
Maciel 0 331 68
scandal 0 331 68
to 0 331 68
the 0 331 68
end. 0 331 68

He 0 331 69
even 0 331 69
removed 0 331 69
the 0 331 69
Nuncio 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
Mexico 0 331 69
City, 0 331 69
Justo 0 331 69
Mullor, 0 331 69
who 0 331 69
refused 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
be 0 331 69
an 0 331 69
accomplice 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
his 0 331 69
scheme 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
cover 0 331 69
Maciel, 0 331 69
and 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
his 0 331 69
place 0 331 69
appointed 0 331 69
Sandri, 0 331 69
then-Nuncio 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
Venezuela, 0 331 69
who 0 331 69
was 0 331 69
willing 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
collaborate 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
the 0 331 69
cover-up. 0 331 69

Sodano 0 331 70
even 0 331 70
went 0 331 70
so 0 331 70
far 0 331 70
as 0 331 70
to 0 331 70
issue 0 331 70
a 0 331 70
statement 0 331 70
to 0 331 70
the 0 331 70
Vatican 0 331 70
press 0 331 70
office 0 331 70
in 0 331 70
which 0 331 70
a 0 331 70
falsehood 0 331 70
was 0 331 70
affirmed, 0 331 70
that 0 331 70
is, 0 331 70
that 0 331 70
Pope 0 331 70
Benedict 0 331 70
had 0 331 70
decided 0 331 70
that 0 331 70
the 0 331 70
Maciel 0 331 70
case 0 331 70
should 0 331 70
be 0 331 70
considered 0 331 70
closed. 0 331 70

Benedict 0 331 71
reacted, 0 331 71
despite 0 331 71
Sodano’s 0 331 71
strenuous 0 331 71
defense, 0 331 71
and 0 331 71
Maciel 0 331 71
was 0 331 71
found 0 331 71
guilty 0 331 71
and 0 331 71
irrevocably 0 331 71
condemned. 0 331 71

Was 0 331 72
McCarrick’s 0 331 72
appointment 0 331 72
to 0 331 72
Washington 0 331 72
and 0 331 72
as 0 331 72
Cardinal 0 331 72
the 0 331 72
work 0 331 72
of 0 331 72
Sodano, 0 331 72
when 0 331 72
John 0 331 72
Paul 0 331 72
II 0 331 72
was 0 331 72
already 0 331 72
very 0 331 72
ill? 0 331 72

We 0 331 73
are 0 331 73
not 0 331 73
given 0 331 73
to 0 331 73
know. 0 331 73

However, 0 331 74
it 0 331 74
is 0 331 74
legitimate 0 331 74
to 0 331 74
think 0 331 74
so, 0 331 74
but 0 331 74
I 0 331 74
do 0 331 74
not 0 331 74
think 0 331 74
he 0 331 74
was 0 331 74
the 0 331 74
only 0 331 74
one 0 331 74
responsible 0 331 74
for 0 331 74
this. 0 331 74

McCarrick 0 331 75
frequently 0 331 75
went 0 331 75
to 0 331 75
Rome 0 331 75
and 0 331 75
made 0 331 75
friends 0 331 75
everywhere, 0 331 75
at 0 331 75
all 0 331 75
levels 0 331 75
of 0 331 75
the 0 331 75
Curia. 0 331 75

If 0 331 76
Sodano 0 331 76
had 0 331 76
protected 0 331 76
Maciel, 0 331 76
as 0 331 76
seems 0 331 76
certain, 0 331 76
there 0 331 76
is 0 331 76
no 0 331 76
reason 0 331 76
why 0 331 76
he 0 331 76
wouldn’t 0 331 76
have 0 331 76
done 0 331 76
so 0 331 76
for 0 331 76
McCarrick, 0 331 76
who 0 331 76
according 0 331 76
to 0 331 76
many 0 331 76
had 0 331 76
the 0 331 76
financial 0 331 76
means 0 331 76
to 0 331 76
influence 0 331 76
decisions. 0 331 76

His 0 331 77
nomination 0 331 77
to 0 331 77
Washington 0 331 77
was 0 331 77
opposed 0 331 77
by 0 331 77
then-Prefect 0 331 77
of 0 331 77
the 0 331 77

At 0 331 78
the 0 331 78
Nunciature 0 331 78

written 0 331 78
in 0 331 78

hand, 0 331 78
in 0 331 78
which 0 331 78
Cardinal 0 331 78
Re 0 331 78
disassociates 0 331 78
himself 0 331 78
from 0 331 78
the 0 331 78
appointment 0 331 78
and 0 331 78
states 0 331 78
that 0 331 78
McCarrick 0 331 78
was 0 331 78
14th 0 331 78
on 0 331 78
the 0 331 78
list 0 331 78

Nuncio 0 331 79
Sambi’s 0 331 79
report, 0 331 79
with 0 331 79
all 0 331 79
the 0 331 79
attachments, 0 331 79
was 0 331 79
sent 0 331 79

Cardinal 0 331 79
Tarcisio 0 331 79
Bertone, 0 331 79
as 0 331 79
Secretary 0 331 79

25, 0 331 80
2008, 0 331 80
were 0 331 80
also 0 331 80
presumably 0 331 80
handed 0 331 80
over 0 331 80
to 0 331 80
him 0 331 80
by 0 331 80
the 0 331 80
Substitute. 0 331 80

As 0 331 81
already 0 331 81
mentioned, 0 331 81
the 0 331 81
Cardinal 0 331 81
had 0 331 81
no 0 331 81

in 0 331 81
insistently 0 331 81
presenting 0 331 81

of 0 331 81
Vigevano 0 331 81
and 0 331 81
later 0 331 81
removed 0 331 81

the 0 331 82
current 0 331 82

As 0 331 84

Obviously, 0 331 95
the 0 331 95
first 0 331 95
to 0 331 95
have 0 331 95
been 0 331 95
informed 0 331 95
of 0 331 95
the 0 331 95
measures 0 331 95
taken 0 331 95
by 0 331 95
Pope 0 331 95
Benedict 0 331 95
was 0 331 95
McCarrick’s 0 331 95
successor 0 331 95
in 0 331 95
Washington 0 331 95
See, 0 331 95
Cardinal 0 331 95
Donald 0 331 95
Wuerl, 0 331 95
whose 0 331 95
situation 0 331 95
is 0 331 95
now 0 331 95
completely 0 331 95
compromised 0 331 95
by 0 331 95
the 0 331 95
recent 0 331 95
revelations 0 331 95
regarding 0 331 95
his 0 331 95
behavior 0 331 95
as 0 331 95
Bishop 0 331 95
of 0 331 95
Pittsburgh. 0 331 95

It 0 331 96
is 0 331 96
absolutely 0 331 96
unthinkable 0 331 96
that 0 331 96
Nunzio 0 331 96
Sambi, 0 331 96
who 0 331 96
was 0 331 96
an 0 331 96
extremely 0 331 96
responsible 0 331 96
person, 0 331 96
loyal, 0 331 96
direct 0 331 96
and 0 331 96
explicit 0 331 96
in 0 331 96
his 0 331 96
way 0 331 96
of 0 331 96
being 0 331 96
(a 0 331 96
true 0 331 96
son 0 331 96
of 0 331 96
Romagna) 0 331 96
did 0 331 96
not 0 331 96
speak 0 331 96
to 0 331 96
him 0 331 96
about 0 331 96
it. 0 331 96

In 0 331 97
any 0 331 97
case, 0 331 97
I 0 331 97
myself 0 331 97
brought 0 331 97
up 0 331 97
the 0 331 97
subject 0 331 97
with 0 331 97
Cardinal 0 331 97
Wuerl 0 331 97
on 0 331 97
several 0 331 97
occasions, 0 331 97
and 0 331 97
I 0 331 97
certainly 0 331 97
didn’t 0 331 97
need 0 331 97
to 0 331 97
go 0 331 97
into 0 331 97
detail 0 331 97
because 0 331 97
it 0 331 97
was 0 331 97
immediately 0 331 97
clear 0 331 97
to 0 331 97
me 0 331 97
that 0 331 97
he 0 331 97
was 0 331 97
fully 0 331 97
aware 0 331 97
of 0 331 97
it. 0 331 97

I 0 331 98
also 0 331 98
remember 0 331 98
in 0 331 98
particular 0 331 98
the 0 331 98
fact 0 331 98
that 0 331 98
I 0 331 98
had 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
draw 0 331 98
his 0 331 98
attention 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
it, 0 331 98
because 0 331 98
I 0 331 98
realized 0 331 98
that 0 331 98
in 0 331 98
an 0 331 98
archdiocesan 0 331 98
publication, 0 331 98
on 0 331 98
the 0 331 98
back 0 331 98
cover 0 331 98
in 0 331 98
color, 0 331 98
there 0 331 98
was 0 331 98
an 0 331 98
announcement 0 331 98
inviting 0 331 98
young 0 331 98
men 0 331 98
who 0 331 98
thought 0 331 98
they 0 331 98
had 0 331 98
a 0 331 98
vocation 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
the 0 331 98
priesthood 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
a 0 331 98
meeting 0 331 98
with 0 331 98
Cardinal 0 331 98
McCarrick. 0 331 98

I 0 331 99
immediately 0 331 99
phoned 0 331 99
Cardinal 0 331 99
Wuerl, 0 331 99
who 0 331 99
expressed 0 331 99
his 0 331 99
surprise 0 331 99
to 0 331 99
me, 0 331 99
telling 0 331 99
me 0 331 99
that 0 331 99
he 0 331 99
knew 0 331 99
nothing 0 331 99
about 0 331 99
that 0 331 99
announcement 0 331 99
and 0 331 99
that 0 331 99
he 0 331 99
would 0 331 99
cancel 0 331 99
it. 0 331 99

If, 0 331 100
as 0 331 100
he 0 331 100
now 0 331 100
continues 0 331 100
to 0 331 100
state, 0 331 100
he 0 331 100
knew 0 331 100
nothing 0 331 100
of 0 331 100
the 0 331 100
abuses 0 331 100
committed 0 331 100
by 0 331 100
McCarrick 0 331 100
and 0 331 100
the 0 331 100
measures 0 331 100
taken 0 331 100
by 0 331 100
Pope 0 331 100
Benedict, 0 331 100
how 0 331 100
can 0 331 100
his 0 331 100
answer 0 331 100
be 0 331 100
explained? 0 331 100

His 0 331 101
recent 0 331 101
statements 0 331 101
that 0 331 101
he 0 331 101
knew 0 331 101
nothing 0 331 101
about 0 331 101
it, 0 331 101
even 0 331 101
though 0 331 101
at 0 331 101
first 0 331 101
he 0 331 101
cunningly 0 331 101
referred 0 331 101
to 0 331 101
compensation 0 331 101
for 0 331 101
the 0 331 101
two 0 331 101
victims, 0 331 101
are 0 331 101
absolutely 1 331 101
laughable. 1 331 101

The 0 331 102
Cardinal 0 331 102
lies 0 331 102
shamelessly 1 331 102
and 0 331 102
prevails 0 331 102
upon 0 331 102
his 0 331 102
Chancellor, 0 331 102
Monsignor 0 331 102
Antonicelli, 0 331 102
to 0 331 102
lie 0 331 102
as 0 331 102
well. 0 331 102

Cardinal 0 331 103
Wuerl 0 331 103
also 0 331 103
clearly 0 331 103
lied 0 331 103
on 0 331 103
another 0 331 103
occasion. 0 331 103

Following 0 331 104
a 0 331 104
morally 0 331 104
unacceptable 0 331 104
event 0 331 104
authorized 0 331 104
by 0 331 104
the 0 331 104
academic 0 331 104
authorities 0 331 104
of 0 331 104
Georgetown 0 331 104
University, 0 331 104
I 0 331 104
brought 0 331 104
it 0 331 104
to 0 331 104
the 0 331 104
attention 0 331 104
of 0 331 104
its 0 331 104
President, 0 331 104
Dr. 0 331 104
John 0 331 104
DeGioia, 0 331 104
sending 0 331 104
him 0 331 104
two 0 331 104
subsequent 0 331 104
letters. 0 331 104

Before 0 331 105
forwarding 0 331 105
them 0 331 105
to 0 331 105
the 0 331 105
addressee, 0 331 105
so 0 331 105
as 0 331 105
to 0 331 105
handle 0 331 105
things 0 331 105
properly, 0 331 105
I 0 331 105
personally 0 331 105
gave 0 331 105
a 0 331 105
copy 0 331 105
of 0 331 105
them 0 331 105
to 0 331 105
the 0 331 105
Cardinal 0 331 105
with 0 331 105
an 0 331 105
accompanying 0 331 105
letter 0 331 105
I 0 331 105
had 0 331 105
written. 0 331 105

The 0 331 106
Cardinal 0 331 106
told 0 331 106
me 0 331 106
that 0 331 106
he 0 331 106
knew 0 331 106
nothing 0 331 106
about 0 331 106
it. 0 331 106

However, 0 331 107
he 0 331 107
failed 0 331 107
to 0 331 107
acknowledge 0 331 107
receipt 0 331 107
of 0 331 107
my 0 331 107
two 0 331 107
letters, 0 331 107
contrary 0 331 107
to 0 331 107
what 0 331 107
he 0 331 107
customarily 0 331 107
did. 0 331 107

I 0 331 108
subsequently 0 331 108
learned 0 331 108
that 0 331 108
the 0 331 108
event 0 331 108
at 0 331 108
Georgetown 0 331 108
had 0 331 108
taken 0 331 108
place 0 331 108
for 0 331 108
seven 0 331 108
years. 0 331 108

But 0 331 109
the 0 331 109
Cardinal 0 331 109
knew 0 331 109
nothing 0 331 109
about 0 331 109
it! 0 331 109

Cardinal 0 331 110
Wuerl, 0 331 110
well 0 331 110
aware 0 331 110
of 0 331 110
the 0 331 110
continuous 0 331 110
abuses 0 331 110
committed 0 331 110
by 0 331 110
Cardinal 0 331 110
McCarrick 0 331 110
and 0 331 110
the 0 331 110
sanctions 0 331 110
imposed 0 331 110
on 0 331 110
him 0 331 110
by 0 331 110
Pope 0 331 110
Benedict, 0 331 110
transgressing 0 331 110
the 0 331 110
Pope’s 0 331 110
order, 0 331 110
also 0 331 110
allowed 0 331 110
him 0 331 110
to 0 331 110
reside 0 331 110
at 0 331 110
a 0 331 110
seminary 0 331 110
in 0 331 110
Washington 0 331 110
D.C. 0 331 110

In 0 331 111
doing 0 331 111
so, 0 331 111
he 0 331 111
put 0 331 111
other 0 331 111
seminarians 0 331 111
at 0 331 111
risk. 0 331 111

Bishop 0 331 112
Paul 0 331 112
Bootkoski, 0 331 112
emeritus 0 331 112
of 0 331 112
Metuchen, 0 331 112
and 0 331 112
Archbishop 0 331 112
John 0 331 112
Myers, 0 331 112
emeritus 0 331 112
of 0 331 112
Newark, 0 331 112
covered 0 331 112
up 0 331 112
the 0 331 112
abuses 0 331 112
committed 0 331 112
by 0 331 112
McCarrick 0 331 112
in 0 331 112
their 0 331 112
respective 0 331 112
dioceses 0 331 112
and 0 331 112
compensated 0 331 112
two 0 331 112
of 0 331 112
his 0 331 112
victims. 0 331 112

They 0 331 113
cannot 0 331 113
deny 0 331 113
it 0 331 113
and 0 331 113
they 0 331 113
must 0 331 113
be 0 331 113
interrogated 0 331 113
in 0 331 113
order 0 331 113
to 0 331 113
reveal 0 331 113
every 0 331 113
circumstance 0 331 113
and 0 331 113
all 0 331 113
responsibility 0 331 113
regarding 0 331 113
this 0 331 113
matter. 0 331 113

Cardinal 0 331 114
Kevin 0 331 114
Farrell, 0 331 114
who 0 331 114
was 0 331 114
recently 0 331 114
interviewed 0 331 114
by 0 331 114
the 0 331 114
media, 0 331 114
also 0 331 114
said 0 331 114
that 0 331 114
he 0 331 114
didn’t 0 331 114
have 0 331 114
the 0 331 114
slightest 0 331 114
idea 0 331 114
about 0 331 114
the 0 331 114
abuses 0 331 114
committed 0 331 114
by 0 331 114
McCarrick. 0 331 114

Given 0 331 115
his 0 331 115
tenure 0 331 115
in 0 331 115
Washington, 0 331 115
Dallas 0 331 115
and 0 331 115
now 0 331 115
Rome, 0 331 115
I 0 331 115
think 0 331 115
no 0 331 115
one 0 331 115
can 0 331 115
honestly 0 331 115
believe 0 331 115
him. 0 331 115

I 0 331 116
don’t 0 331 116
know 0 331 116
if 0 331 116
he 0 331 116
was 0 331 116
ever 0 331 116
asked 0 331 116
if 0 331 116
he 0 331 116
knew 0 331 116
about 0 331 116
Maciel’s 0 331 116
crimes. 0 331 116

If 0 331 117
he 0 331 117
were 0 331 117
to 0 331 117
deny 0 331 117
this, 0 331 117
would 0 331 117
anybody 0 331 117
believe 0 331 117
him 0 331 117
given 0 331 117
that 0 331 117
he 0 331 117
occupied 0 331 117
positions 0 331 117
of 0 331 117
responsibility 0 331 117
as 0 331 117
a 0 331 117
member 0 331 117
of 0 331 117
the 0 331 117
Legionaries 0 331 117
of 0 331 117
Christ? 0 331 117

Regarding 0 331 118
Cardinal 0 331 118
Sean 0 331 118
O’Malley, 0 331 118
I 0 331 118
would 0 331 118
simply 0 331 118
say 0 331 118
that 0 331 118
his 0 331 118
latest 0 331 118
statements 0 331 118
on 0 331 118
the 0 331 118
McCarrick 0 331 118
case 0 331 118
are 0 331 118
disconcerting, 1 331 118
and 0 331 118
have 0 331 118
totally 1 331 118
obscured 0 331 118
his 0 331 118
transparency 0 331 118
and 0 331 118
credibility. 0 331 118

My 0 331 120
conscience 0 331 120
requires 0 331 120
me 0 331 120
also 0 331 120
to 0 331 120
reveal 0 331 120
facts 0 331 120
that 0 331 120
I 0 331 120
have 0 331 120
experienced 0 331 120
personally, 0 331 120
concerning 0 331 120
Pope 0 331 120
Francis, 0 331 120
that 0 331 120
have 0 331 120
a 0 331 120
dramatic 1 331 120
significance, 0 331 120
which 0 331 120
as 0 331 120
Bishop, 0 331 120
sharing 0 331 120
the 0 331 120
collegial 0 331 120
responsibility 0 331 120
of 0 331 120
all 0 331 120
the 0 331 120
bishops 0 331 120
for 0 331 120
the 0 331 120
universal 0 331 120
Church, 0 331 120
do 0 331 120
not 0 331 120
allow 0 331 120
me 0 331 120
to 0 331 120
remain 0 331 120
silent, 0 331 120
and 0 331 120
that 0 331 120
I 0 331 120
state 0 331 120
here, 0 331 120
ready 0 331 120
to 0 331 120
reaffirm 0 331 120
them 0 331 120
under 0 331 120
oath 0 331 120
by 0 331 120
calling 0 331 120
on 0 331 120
God 0 331 120
as 0 331 120
my 0 331 120
witness. 0 331 120

In 0 331 121
the 0 331 121
last 0 331 121
months 0 331 121
of 0 331 121
his 0 331 121
pontificate, 0 331 121
Pope 0 331 121
Benedict 0 331 121
XVI 0 331 121
had 0 331 121
convened 0 331 121
a 0 331 121
meeting 0 331 121
of 0 331 121
all 0 331 121
the 0 331 121
apostolic 0 331 121
nuncios 0 331 121
in 0 331 121
Rome, 0 331 121
as 0 331 121
Paul 0 331 121
VI 0 331 121
and 0 331 121
St. 0 331 121
John 0 331 121
Paul 0 331 121
II 0 331 121
had 0 331 121
done 0 331 121
on 0 331 121
several 0 331 121
occasions. 0 331 121

The 0 331 122
date 0 331 122
set 0 331 122
for 0 331 122
the 0 331 122
audience 0 331 122
with 0 331 122
the 0 331 122
Pope 0 331 122
was 0 331 122
Friday, 0 331 122
June 0 331 122
21, 0 331 122
2013. 0 331 122

Pope 0 331 123
Francis 0 331 123
kept 0 331 123
this 0 331 123
commitment 0 331 123
made 0 331 123
by 0 331 123
his 0 331 123
predecessor. 0 331 123

Of 0 331 124
course 0 331 124
I 0 331 124
also 0 331 124
came 0 331 124
to 0 331 124
Rome 0 331 124
from 0 331 124
Washington. 0 331 124

It 0 331 125
was 0 331 125
my 0 331 125
first 0 331 125
meeting 0 331 125
with 0 331 125
the 0 331 125
new 0 331 125
Pope 0 331 125
elected 0 331 125
only 0 331 125
three 0 331 125
months 0 331 125
prior, 0 331 125
after 0 331 125
the 0 331 125
resignation 0 331 125
of 0 331 125
Pope 0 331 125
Benedict. 0 331 125

On 0 331 126
the 0 331 126
morning 0 331 126
of 0 331 126
Thursday, 0 331 126
June 0 331 126
20, 0 331 126
2013, 0 331 126
I 0 331 126
went 0 331 126
to 0 331 126
the 0 331 126
Domus 0 331 126
Sanctae 0 331 126
Marthae, 0 331 126
to 0 331 126
join 0 331 126
my 0 331 126
colleagues 0 331 126
who 0 331 126
were 0 331 126
staying 0 331 126
there. 0 331 126

As 0 331 127
soon 0 331 127
as 0 331 127
I 0 331 127
entered 0 331 127
the 0 331 127
hall 0 331 127
I 0 331 127
met 0 331 127
Cardinal 0 331 127
McCarrick, 0 331 127
who 0 331 127
wore 0 331 127
the 0 331 127
red-trimmed 0 331 127
cassock. 0 331 127

I 0 331 128
greeted 0 331 128
him 0 331 128
respectfully 0 331 128
as 0 331 128
I 0 331 128
had 0 331 128
always 0 331 128
done. 0 331 128

He 0 331 129
immediately 0 331 129
said 0 331 129
to 0 331 129
me, 0 331 129
in 0 331 129
a 0 331 129
tone 0 331 129
somewhere 0 331 129
between 0 331 129
ambiguous 0 331 129
and 0 331 129
triumphant: 0 331 129
“The 0 331 129
Pope 0 331 129
received 0 331 129
me 0 331 129
yesterday, 0 331 129
tomorrow 0 331 129
I 0 331 129
am 0 331 129
going 0 331 129
to 0 331 129
China.” 0 331 129

At 0 331 130
the 0 331 130
time 0 331 130
I 0 331 130
knew 0 331 130
nothing 0 331 130
of 0 331 130
his 0 331 130
long 0 331 130
friendship 0 331 130
with 0 331 130
Cardinal 0 331 130
Bergoglio 0 331 130
and 0 331 130
of 0 331 130
the 0 331 130
important 0 331 130
part 0 331 130
he 0 331 130
had 0 331 130
played 0 331 130
in 0 331 130
his 0 331 130
recent 0 331 130
election, 0 331 130
as 0 331 130
McCarrick 0 331 130
himself 0 331 130
would 0 331 130
later 0 331 130
reveal 0 331 130
in 0 331 130
a 0 331 130
lecture 0 331 130
at 0 331 130
Villanova 0 331 130
University 0 331 130
and 0 331 130
in 0 331 130
an 0 331 130
interview 0 331 130
with 0 331 130
the 0 331 130
National 0 331 130
Catholic 0 331 130
Reporter. 0 331 130

Nor 0 331 131
had 0 331 131
I 0 331 131
ever 0 331 131
thought 0 331 131
of 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
fact 0 331 131
that 0 331 131
he 0 331 131
had 0 331 131
participated 0 331 131
in 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
preliminary 0 331 131
meetings 0 331 131
of 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
recent 0 331 131
conclave, 0 331 131
and 0 331 131
of 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
role 0 331 131
he 0 331 131
had 0 331 131
been 0 331 131
able 0 331 131
to 0 331 131
have 0 331 131
as 0 331 131
a 0 331 131
cardinal 0 331 131
elector 0 331 131
in 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
2005 0 331 131
conclave. 0 331 131

Therefore 0 331 132
I 0 331 132
did 0 331 132
not 0 331 132
immediately 0 331 132
grasp 0 331 132
the 0 331 132
meaning 0 331 132
of 0 331 132
the 0 331 132
encrypted 0 331 132
message 0 331 132
that 0 331 132
McCarrick 0 331 132
had 0 331 132
communicated 0 331 132
to 0 331 132
me, 0 331 132
but 0 331 132
that 0 331 132
would 0 331 132
become 0 331 132
clear 0 331 132
to 0 331 132
me 0 331 132
in 0 331 132
the 0 331 132
days 0 331 132
immediately 0 331 132
following. 0 331 132

The 0 331 133
next 0 331 133
day 0 331 133
the 0 331 133
audience 0 331 133
with 0 331 133
Pope 0 331 133
Francis 0 331 133
took 0 331 133
place. 0 331 133

After 0 331 134
his 0 331 134
address, 0 331 134
which 0 331 134
was 0 331 134
partly 0 331 134
read 0 331 134
and 0 331 134
partly 0 331 134
delivered 0 331 134
off 0 331 134
the 0 331 134
cuff, 0 331 134
the 0 331 134
Pope 0 331 134
wished 0 331 134
to 0 331 134
greet 0 331 134
all 0 331 134
the 0 331 134
nuncios 0 331 134
one 0 331 134
by 0 331 134
one. 0 331 134

In 0 331 135
single 0 331 135
file, 0 331 135
I 0 331 135
remember 0 331 135
that 0 331 135
I 0 331 135
was 0 331 135
among 0 331 135
the 0 331 135
last. 0 331 135

When 0 331 136
it 0 331 136
was 0 331 136
my 0 331 136
turn, 0 331 136
I 0 331 136
just 0 331 136
had 0 331 136
time 0 331 136
to 0 331 136
say 0 331 136
to 0 331 136
him, 0 331 136
“I 0 331 136
am 0 331 136
the 0 331 136
Nuncio 0 331 136
to 0 331 136
the 0 331 136
United 0 331 136
States.” 0 331 136
He 0 331 136
immediately 0 331 136
assailed 0 331 136
me 0 331 136
with 0 331 136
a 0 331 136
tone 0 331 136
of 0 331 136
reproach, 0 331 136
using 0 331 136
these 0 331 136
words: 0 331 136
“The 0 331 136
Bishops 0 331 136
in 0 331 136
the 0 331 136
United 0 331 136
States 0 331 136
must 0 331 136
not 0 331 136
be 0 331 136
ideologized! 0 331 136

They 0 331 137
must 0 331 137
be 0 331 137
shepherds!”Of 0 331 137
course 0 331 137
I 0 331 137
was 0 331 137
not 0 331 137
in 0 331 137
a 0 331 137
position 0 331 137
to 0 331 137
ask 0 331 137
for 0 331 137
explanations 0 331 137
about 0 331 137
the 0 331 137
meaning 0 331 137
of 0 331 137
his 0 331 137
words 0 331 137
and 0 331 137
the 0 331 137
aggressive 1 331 137
way 0 331 137
in 0 331 137
which 0 331 137
he 0 331 137
had 0 331 137
upbraided 0 331 137
me. 0 331 137

I 0 331 138
had 0 331 138
in 0 331 138
my 0 331 138
hand 0 331 138
a 0 331 138
book 0 331 138
in 0 331 138
Portuguese 0 331 138
that 0 331 138
Cardinal 0 331 138
O’Malley 0 331 138
had 0 331 138
sent 0 331 138
me 0 331 138
for 0 331 138
the 0 331 138
Pope 0 331 138
a 0 331 138
few 0 331 138
days 0 331 138
earlier, 0 331 138
telling 0 331 138
me 0 331 138
“so 0 331 138
he 0 331 138
could 0 331 138
go 0 331 138
over 0 331 138
his 0 331 138
Portuguese 0 331 138
before 0 331 138
going 0 331 138
to 0 331 138
Rio 0 331 138
for 0 331 138
World 0 331 138
Youth 0 331 138
Day.” 0 331 138
I 0 331 138
handed 0 331 138
it 0 331 138
to 0 331 138
him 0 331 138
immediately, 0 331 138
and 0 331 138
so 0 331 138
freed 0 331 138
myself 0 331 138
from 0 331 138
that 0 331 138
extremely 0 331 138
disconcerting 0 331 138
and 0 331 138
embarrassing 0 331 138
situation. 0 331 138

At 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
end 0 331 139
of 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
audience 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
Pope 0 331 139
announced: 0 331 139
“Those 0 331 139
of 0 331 139
you 0 331 139
who 0 331 139
are 0 331 139
still 0 331 139
in 0 331 139
Rome 0 331 139
next 0 331 139
Sunday 0 331 139
are 0 331 139
invited 0 331 139
to 0 331 139
concelebrate 0 331 139
with 0 331 139
me 0 331 139
at 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
Domus 0 331 139
Sanctae 0 331 139
Marthae.” 0 331 139
I 0 331 139
naturally 0 331 139
thought 0 331 139
of 0 331 139
staying 0 331 139
on 0 331 139
to 0 331 139
clarify 0 331 139
as 0 331 139
soon 0 331 139
as 0 331 139
possible 0 331 139
what 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
Pope 0 331 139
intended 0 331 139
to 0 331 139
tell 0 331 139
me. 0 331 139

On 0 331 140
Sunday 0 331 140
June 0 331 140
23, 0 331 140
before 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
concelebration 0 331 140
with 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
Pope, 0 331 140
I 0 331 140
asked 0 331 140
Monsignor 0 331 140
Ricca, 0 331 140
who 0 331 140
as 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
person 0 331 140
in 0 331 140
charge 0 331 140
of 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
house 0 331 140
helped 0 331 140
us 0 331 140
put 0 331 140
on 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
vestments, 0 331 140
if 0 331 140
he 0 331 140
could 0 331 140
ask 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
Pope 0 331 140
if 0 331 140
he 0 331 140
could 0 331 140
receive 0 331 140
me 0 331 140
sometime 0 331 140
in 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
following 0 331 140
week. 0 331 140

How 0 331 141
could 0 331 141
I 0 331 141
have 0 331 141
returned 0 331 141
to 0 331 141
Washington 0 331 141
without 0 331 141
having 0 331 141
clarified 0 331 141
what 0 331 141
the 0 331 141
Pope 0 331 141
wanted 0 331 141
of 0 331 141
me? 0 331 141

At 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
end 0 331 142
of 0 331 142
Mass, 0 331 142
while 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
Pope 0 331 142
was 0 331 142
greeting 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
few 0 331 142
lay 0 331 142
people 0 331 142
present, 0 331 142
Monsignor 0 331 142
Fabian 0 331 142
Pedacchio, 0 331 142
his 0 331 142
Argentine 0 331 142
secretary, 0 331 142
came 0 331 142
to 0 331 142
me 0 331 142
and 0 331 142
said: 0 331 142
“The 0 331 142
Pope 0 331 142
told 0 331 142
me 0 331 142
to 0 331 142
ask 0 331 142
if 0 331 142
you 0 331 142
are 0 331 142
free 0 331 142
now!” 0 331 142
Naturally, 0 331 142
I 0 331 142
replied 0 331 142
that 0 331 142
I 0 331 142
was 0 331 142
at 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
Pope’s 0 331 142
disposal 0 331 142
and 0 331 142
that 0 331 142
I 0 331 142
thanked 0 331 142
him 0 331 142
for 0 331 142
receiving 0 331 142
me 0 331 142
immediately. 0 331 142

The 0 331 143
Pope 0 331 143
took 0 331 143
me 0 331 143
to 0 331 143
the 0 331 143
first 0 331 143
floor 0 331 143
in 0 331 143
his 0 331 143
apartment 0 331 143
and 0 331 143
said: 0 331 143
“We 0 331 143
have 0 331 143
40 0 331 143
minutes 0 331 143
before 0 331 143
the 0 331 143
Angelus.” 0 331 143

I 0 331 144
began 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
conversation, 0 331 144
asking 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
Pope 0 331 144
what 0 331 144
he 0 331 144
intended 0 331 144
to 0 331 144
say 0 331 144
to 0 331 144
me 0 331 144
with 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
words 0 331 144
he 0 331 144
had 0 331 144
addressed 0 331 144
to 0 331 144
me 0 331 144
when 0 331 144
I 0 331 144
greeted 0 331 144
him 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
previous 0 331 144
Friday. 0 331 144

And 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Pope, 0 331 145
in 0 331 145
a 0 331 145
very 0 331 145
different, 0 331 145
friendly, 0 331 145
almost 0 331 145
affectionate 0 331 145
tone, 0 331 145
said 0 331 145
to 0 331 145
me: 0 331 145
“Yes, 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Bishops 0 331 145
in 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
United 0 331 145
States 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
ideologized, 0 331 145
they 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
right-wing 0 331 145
like 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Archbishop 0 331 145
of 0 331 145
Philadelphia, 0 331 145
(the 0 331 145
Pope 0 331 145
did 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
give 0 331 145
me 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
name 0 331 145
of 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Archbishop) 0 331 145
they 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
shepherds; 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
they 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
left-wing 0 331 145
— 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
he 0 331 145
added, 0 331 145
raising 0 331 145
both 0 331 145
arms 0 331 145
— 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
when 0 331 145
I 0 331 145
say 0 331 145
left-wing 0 331 145
I 0 331 145
mean 0 331 145
homosexual.” 0 331 145
Of 0 331 145
course, 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
logic 0 331 145
of 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
correlation 0 331 145
between 0 331 145
being 0 331 145
left-wing 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
being 0 331 145
homosexual 0 331 145
escaped 0 331 145
me, 0 331 145
but 0 331 145
I 0 331 145
added 0 331 145
nothing 0 331 145
else. 0 331 145

Immediately 0 331 146
after, 0 331 146
the 0 331 146
Pope 0 331 146
asked 0 331 146
me 0 331 146
in 0 331 146
a 0 331 146
deceitful 0 331 146
way: 0 331 146
“What 0 331 146
is 0 331 146
Cardinal 0 331 146
McCarrick 0 331 146
like?” 0 331 146
I 0 331 146
answered 0 331 146
him 0 331 146
with 0 331 146
complete 0 331 146
frankness 0 331 146
and, 0 331 146
if 0 331 146
you 0 331 146
want, 0 331 146
with 0 331 146
great 0 331 146
naiveté: 0 331 146
“Holy 0 331 146
Father, 0 331 146
I 0 331 146
don’t 0 331 146
know 0 331 146
if 0 331 146
you 0 331 146
know 0 331 146
Cardinal 0 331 146
McCarrick, 0 331 146
but 0 331 146
if 0 331 146
you 0 331 146
ask 0 331 146
the 0 331 146
Congregation 0 331 146
for 0 331 146
Bishops 0 331 146
there 0 331 146
is 0 331 146
a 0 331 146
dossier 0 331 146
this 0 331 146
thick 0 331 146
about 0 331 146
him. 0 331 146

He 0 331 147
corrupted 0 331 147
generations 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
seminarians 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
priests 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
Pope 0 331 147
Benedict 0 331 147
ordered 0 331 147
him 0 331 147
to 0 331 147
withdraw 0 331 147
to 0 331 147
a 0 331 147
life 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
prayer 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
penance.” 0 331 147
The 0 331 147
Pope 0 331 147
did 0 331 147
not 0 331 147
make 0 331 147
the 0 331 147
slightest 0 331 147
comment 0 331 147
about 0 331 147
those 0 331 147
very 1 331 147
grave 1 331 147
words 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
mine 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
did 0 331 147
not 0 331 147
show 0 331 147
any 0 331 147
expression 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
surprise 0 331 147
on 0 331 147
his 0 331 147
face, 0 331 147
as 0 331 147
if 0 331 147
he 0 331 147
had 0 331 147
already 0 331 147
known 0 331 147
the 0 331 147
matter 0 331 147
for 0 331 147
some 0 331 147
time, 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
he 0 331 147
immediately 0 331 147
changed 0 331 147
the 0 331 147
subject. 0 331 147

But 0 331 148
then, 0 331 148
what 0 331 148
was 0 331 148
the 0 331 148
Pope’s 0 331 148
purpose 0 331 148
in 0 331 148
asking 0 331 148
me 0 331 148
that 0 331 148
question: 0 331 148
“What 0 331 148
is 0 331 148
Cardinal 0 331 148
McCarrick 0 331 148
like?” 0 331 148
He 0 331 148
clearly 0 331 148
wanted 0 331 148
to 0 331 148
find 0 331 148
out 0 331 148
if 0 331 148
I 0 331 148
was 0 331 148
an 0 331 148
ally 0 331 148
of 0 331 148
McCarrick 0 331 148
or 0 331 148
not. 0 331 148

Back 0 331 149
in 0 331 149
Washington 0 331 149
everything 0 331 149
became 0 331 149
very 0 331 149
clear 0 331 149
to 0 331 149
me, 0 331 149
thanks 0 331 149
also 0 331 149
to 0 331 149
a 0 331 149
new 0 331 149
event 0 331 149
that 0 331 149
occurred 0 331 149
only 0 331 149
a 0 331 149
few 0 331 149
days 0 331 149
after 0 331 149
my 0 331 149
meeting 0 331 149
with 0 331 149
Pope 0 331 149
Francis. 0 331 149

When 0 331 150
the 0 331 150
new 0 331 150
Bishop 0 331 150
Mark 0 331 150
Seitz 0 331 150
took 0 331 150
possession 0 331 150
of 0 331 150
the 0 331 150
Diocese 0 331 150
of 0 331 150
El 0 331 150
Paso 0 331 150
on 0 331 150
July 0 331 150
9, 0 331 150
2013, 0 331 150
I 0 331 150
sent 0 331 150
the 0 331 150
first 0 331 150
Counsellor, 0 331 150
Monsignor 0 331 150
Jean-François 0 331 150
Lantheaume, 0 331 150
while 0 331 150
I 0 331 150
went 0 331 150
to 0 331 150
Dallas 0 331 150
that 0 331 150
same 0 331 150
day 0 331 150
for 0 331 150
an 0 331 150
international 0 331 150
meeting 0 331 150
on 0 331 150
Bioethics. 0 331 150

When 0 331 151
he 0 331 151
got 0 331 151
back, 0 331 151
Monsignor 0 331 151
Lantheaume 0 331 151
told 0 331 151
me 0 331 151
that 0 331 151
in 0 331 151
El 0 331 151
Paso 0 331 151
he 0 331 151
had 0 331 151
met 0 331 151
Cardinal 0 331 151
McCarrick 0 331 151
who, 0 331 151
taking 0 331 151
him 0 331 151
aside, 0 331 151
told 0 331 151
him 0 331 151
almost 0 331 151
the 0 331 151
same 0 331 151
words 0 331 151
that 0 331 151
the 0 331 151
Pope 0 331 151
had 0 331 151
said 0 331 151
to 0 331 151
me 0 331 151
in 0 331 151
Rome: 0 331 151
“the 0 331 151
Bishops 0 331 151
in 0 331 151
the 0 331 151
United 0 331 151
States 0 331 151
must 0 331 151
not 0 331 151
be 0 331 151
ideologized, 0 331 151
they 0 331 151
must 0 331 151
not 0 331 151
be 0 331 151
right-wing, 0 331 151
they 0 331 151
must 0 331 151
be 0 331 151
shepherds….” 0 331 151
I 0 331 151
was 0 331 151
astounded! 0 331 151

It 0 331 152
was 0 331 152
therefore 0 331 152
clear 0 331 152
that 0 331 152
the 0 331 152
words 0 331 152
of 0 331 152
reproach 0 331 152
that 0 331 152
Pope 0 331 152
Francis 0 331 152
had 0 331 152
addressed 0 331 152
to 0 331 152
me 0 331 152
on 0 331 152
June 0 331 152
21, 0 331 152
2013 0 331 152
had 0 331 152
been 0 331 152
put 0 331 152
into 0 331 152
his 0 331 152
mouth 0 331 152
the 0 331 152
day 0 331 152
before 0 331 152
by 0 331 152
Cardinal 0 331 152
McCarrick. 0 331 152

Also 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
Pope’s 0 331 153
mention 0 331 153
“not 0 331 153
like 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
Archbishop 0 331 153
of 0 331 153
Philadelphia” 0 331 153
could 0 331 153
be 0 331 153
traced 0 331 153
to 0 331 153
McCarrick, 0 331 153
because 0 331 153
there 0 331 153
had 0 331 153
been 0 331 153
a 0 331 153
strong 0 331 153
disagreement 0 331 153
between 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
two 0 331 153
of 0 331 153
them 0 331 153
about 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
admission 0 331 153
to 0 331 153
Communion 0 331 153
of 0 331 153
pro-abortion 0 331 153
politicians. 0 331 153

In 0 331 154
his 0 331 154
communication 0 331 154
to 0 331 154
the 0 331 154
bishops, 0 331 154
McCarrick 0 331 154
had 0 331 154
manipulated 0 331 154
a 0 331 154
letter 0 331 154
of 0 331 154
then-Cardinal 0 331 154
Ratzinger 0 331 154
who 0 331 154
prohibited 0 331 154
giving 0 331 154
them 0 331 154
Communion. 0 331 154

Indeed, 0 331 155
I 0 331 155
also 0 331 155
knew 0 331 155
how 0 331 155
certain 0 331 155
Cardinals 0 331 155
such 0 331 155
as 0 331 155
Mahony, 0 331 155
Levada 0 331 155
and 0 331 155
Wuerl, 0 331 155
were 0 331 155
closely 0 331 155
linked 0 331 155
to 0 331 155
McCarrick; 0 331 155
they 0 331 155
had 0 331 155
opposed 0 331 155
the 0 331 155
most 0 331 155
recent 0 331 155
appointments 0 331 155
made 0 331 155
by 0 331 155
Pope 0 331 155
Benedict, 0 331 155
for 0 331 155
important 0 331 155
posts 0 331 155
such 0 331 155
as 0 331 155
Philadelphia, 0 331 155
Baltimore, 0 331 155
Denver 0 331 155
and 0 331 155
San 0 331 155
Francisco. 0 331 155

Not 0 331 156
happy 0 331 156
with 0 331 156
the 0 331 156
trap 0 331 156
he 0 331 156
had 0 331 156
set 0 331 156
for 0 331 156
me 0 331 156
on 0 331 156
June 0 331 156
23, 0 331 156
2013, 0 331 156
when 0 331 156
he 0 331 156
asked 0 331 156
me 0 331 156
about 0 331 156
McCarrick, 0 331 156
only 0 331 156
a 0 331 156
few 0 331 156
months 0 331 156
later, 0 331 156
in 0 331 156
the 0 331 156
audience 0 331 156
he 0 331 156
granted 0 331 156
me 0 331 156
on 0 331 156
October 0 331 156
10, 0 331 156
2013, 0 331 156
Pope 0 331 156
Francis 0 331 156
set 0 331 156
a 0 331 156
second 0 331 156
one 0 331 156
for 0 331 156
me, 0 331 156
this 0 331 156
time 0 331 156
concerning 0 331 156
a 0 331 156
second 0 331 156
of 0 331 156
his 0 331 156
protégés, 0 331 156
Cardinal 0 331 156
Donald 0 331 156
Wuerl. 0 331 156

He 0 331 157
asked 0 331 157
me: 0 331 157
“What 0 331 157
is 0 331 157
Cardinal 0 331 157
Wuerl 0 331 157
like, 0 331 157
is 0 331 157
he 0 331 157
good 0 331 157
or 0 331 157
bad?” 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
replied, 0 331 157
“Holy 0 331 157
Father, 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
will 0 331 157
not 0 331 157
tell 0 331 157
you 0 331 157
if 0 331 157
he 0 331 157
is 0 331 157
good 0 331 157
or 0 331 157
bad, 0 331 157
but 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
will 0 331 157
tell 0 331 157
you 0 331 157
two 0 331 157
facts.” 0 331 157
They 0 331 157
are 0 331 157
the 0 331 157
ones 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
have 0 331 157
already 0 331 157
mentioned 0 331 157
above, 0 331 157
which 0 331 157
concern 0 331 157
Wuerl’s 0 331 157
pastoral 1 331 157
carelessness 1 331 157
regarding 0 331 157
the 0 331 157
aberrant 0 331 157
deviations 0 331 157
at 0 331 157
Georgetown 0 331 157
University 0 331 157
and 0 331 157
the 0 331 157
invitation 0 331 157
by 0 331 157
the 0 331 157
Archdiocese 0 331 157
of 0 331 157
Washington 0 331 157
to 0 331 157
young 0 331 157
aspirants 0 331 157
to 0 331 157
the 0 331 157
priesthood 0 331 157
to 0 331 157
a 0 331 157
meeting 0 331 157
with 0 331 157
McCarrick! 0 331 157

Once 0 331 158
again 0 331 158
the 0 331 158
Pope 0 331 158
did 0 331 158
not 0 331 158
show 0 331 158
any 0 331 158
reaction. 0 331 158

It 0 331 159
was 0 331 159
also 0 331 159
clear 0 331 159
that, 0 331 159
from 0 331 159
the 0 331 159
time 0 331 159
of 0 331 159
Pope 0 331 159
Francis’s 0 331 159
election, 0 331 159
McCarrick, 0 331 159
now 0 331 159
free 0 331 159
from 0 331 159
all 0 331 159
constraints, 0 331 159
had 0 331 159
felt 0 331 159
free 0 331 159
to 0 331 159
travel 0 331 159
continuously, 0 331 159
to 0 331 159
give 0 331 159
lectures 0 331 159
and 0 331 159
interviews. 0 331 159

In 0 331 160
a 0 331 160
team 0 331 160
effort 0 331 160
with 0 331 160
Cardinal 0 331 160
Rodriguez 0 331 160
Maradiaga, 0 331 160

This 0 331 161
is 0 331 161
how 0 331 161
one 0 331 161
explains 0 331 161

Cardinal 0 331 161

Wuerl 0 331 161

was 0 331 161
made 0 331 161
a 0 331 161

With 0 331 162
these 0 331 162
appointments 0 331 162
the 0 331 162
Nunciature 0 331 162

Something 0 331 164
unprecedented 1 331 164
for 0 331 164
such 0 331 164
an 0 331 164
important 0 331 164
position! 0 331 164

The 0 331 165

by 0 331 165
McCarrick, 0 331 165
Maradiaga 0 331 165
and 0 331 165
Wuerl, 0 331 165
united 0 331 165
by 0 331 165
a 0 331 165
wicked 1 331 165
pact 0 331 165
of 0 331 165
abuses 0 331 165
by 0 331 165
the 0 331 165
first, 0 331 165
and 0 331 165
at 0 331 165
least 0 331 165
of 0 331 165
coverup 0 331 165
of 0 331 165
abuses 0 331 165
by 0 331 165
the 0 331 165
other 0 331 165
two. 0 331 165

Their 0 331 166
names 0 331 166
were 0 331 166
not 0 331 166
among 0 331 166
those 0 331 166
presented 0 331 166
by 0 331 166
the 0 331 166
Nunciature 0 331 166
for 0 331 166
Chicago 0 331 166
and 0 331 166
Newark. 0 331 166

Regarding 0 331 167
Cupich, 0 331 167
one 0 331 167
cannot 0 331 167
fail 0 331 167
to 0 331 167
note 0 331 167
his 0 331 167
ostentatious 1 331 167
arrogance, 1 331 167
and 0 331 167
the 0 331 167
insolence 0 331 167
with 0 331 167
which 0 331 167
he 0 331 167
denies 0 331 167
the 0 331 167
evidence 0 331 167
that 0 331 167
is 0 331 167
now 0 331 167
obvious 0 331 167
to 0 331 167
all: 0 331 167
that 0 331 167
80% 0 331 167
of 0 331 167
the 0 331 167
abuses 0 331 167
found 0 331 167
were 0 331 167
committed 0 331 167
against 0 331 167
young 0 331 167
adults 0 331 167
by 0 331 167
homosexuals 0 331 167
who 0 331 167
were 0 331 167
in 0 331 167
a 0 331 167
relationship 0 331 167
of 0 331 167
authority 0 331 167
over 0 331 167
their 0 331 167
victims. 0 331 167

During 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
speech 0 331 168
he 0 331 168
gave 0 331 168
when 0 331 168
he 0 331 168
took 0 331 168
possession 0 331 168
of 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
Chicago 0 331 168
See, 0 331 168
at 0 331 168
which 0 331 168
I 0 331 168
was 0 331 168
present 0 331 168
as 0 331 168
a 0 331 168
representative 0 331 168
of 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
Pope, 0 331 168
Cupich 0 331 168
quipped 0 331 168
that 0 331 168
one 0 331 168
certainly 0 331 168
should 0 331 168
not 0 331 168
expect 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
new 0 331 168
Archbishop 0 331 168
to 0 331 168
walk 0 331 168
on 0 331 168
water. 0 331 168

Perhaps 0 331 169
it 0 331 169
would 0 331 169
be 0 331 169
enough 0 331 169
for 0 331 169
him 0 331 169
to 0 331 169
be 0 331 169
able 0 331 169
to 0 331 169
remain 0 331 169
with 0 331 169
his 0 331 169
feet 0 331 169
on 0 331 169
the 0 331 169
ground 0 331 169
and 0 331 169
not 0 331 169
try 0 331 169
to 0 331 169
turn 0 331 169
reality 0 331 169
upside-down, 0 331 169
blinded 0 331 169
by 0 331 169
his 0 331 169
pro-gay 0 331 169
ideology, 0 331 169
as 0 331 169
he 0 331 169
stated 0 331 169
in 0 331 169
a 0 331 169
recent 0 331 169
interview 0 331 169
with 0 331 169
America 0 331 169
Magazine. 0 331 169

Extolling 0 331 170
his 0 331 170
particular 0 331 170
expertise 0 331 170
in 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
matter, 0 331 170
having 0 331 170
been 0 331 170
President 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
Committee 0 331 170
on 0 331 170
Protection 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
Children 0 331 170
and 0 331 170
Young 0 331 170
People 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
USCCB, 0 331 170
he 0 331 170
asserted 0 331 170
that 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
main 0 331 170
problem 0 331 170
in 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
crisis 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
sexual 0 331 170
abuse 0 331 170
by 0 331 170
clergy 0 331 170
is 0 331 170
not 0 331 170
homosexuality, 0 331 170
and 0 331 170
that 0 331 170
affirming 0 331 170
this 0 331 170
is 0 331 170
only 0 331 170
a 0 331 170
way 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
diverting 0 331 170
attention 0 331 170
from 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
real 0 331 170
problem 0 331 170
which 0 331 170
is 0 331 170
clericalism. 0 331 170

In 0 331 171
support 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
this 0 331 171
thesis, 0 331 171
Cupich 0 331 171
“oddly” 0 331 171
made 0 331 171
reference 0 331 171
to 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
results 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
research 0 331 171
carried 0 331 171
out 0 331 171
at 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
height 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
sexual 0 331 171
abuse 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
minors 0 331 171
crisis 0 331 171
in 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
early 0 331 171
2000s, 0 331 171
while 0 331 171
he 0 331 171
“candidly” 0 331 171
ignored 0 331 171
that 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
results 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
that 0 331 171
investigation 0 331 171
were 0 331 171
totally 0 331 171
denied 0 331 171
by 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
subsequent 0 331 171
Independent 0 331 171

2004 0 331 171
and 0 331 171
2011, 0 331 171
which 0 331 171
concluded 0 331 171
that, 0 331 171
in 0 331 171
cases 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
sexual 0 331 171

81% 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
victims 0 331 171
were 0 331 171
male. 0 331 171

also 0 331 179
demand 0 331 179
this 0 331 179
of 0 331 179
him 0 331 179
in 0 331 179
an 0 331 179
exemplary 0 331 179
manner. 0 331 179

He 0 331 180
must 0 331 180
honestly 0 331 180
state 0 331 180
when 0 331 180
he 0 331 180
first 0 331 180
learned 0 331 180
about 0 331 180
the 0 331 180
crimes 0 331 180
committed 0 331 180
by 0 331 180
McCarrick, 0 331 180
who 0 331 180
abused 0 331 180
his 0 331 180
authority 0 331 180
with 0 331 180
seminarians 0 331 180

In 0 331 181
any 0 331 181
case, 0 331 181
the 0 331 181
Pope 0 331 181
learned 0 331 181
about 0 331 181
it 0 331 181
from 0 331 181
me 0 331 181
on 0 331 181
June 0 331 181
23, 0 331 181

to 0 331 181
cover 0 331 181
for 0 331 181
him. 0 331 181

He 0 331 182
did 0 331 182
not 0 331 182
take 0 331 182
into 0 331 182
account 0 331 182
the 0 331 182
sanctions 0 331 182
that 0 331 182
Pope 0 331 182
Benedict 0 331 182
had 0 331 182
imposed 0 331 182
on 0 331 182
him 0 331 182
and 0 331 182
made 0 331 182
him 0 331 182
his 0 331 182
trusted 0 331 182
counselor 0 331 182
along 0 331 182
with 0 331 182
Maradiaga. 0 331 182

The 0 331 183
latter 0 331 183
[Maradiaga] 0 331 183
is 0 331 183
so 0 331 183
confident 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
Pope’s 0 331 183
protection 0 331 183
that 0 331 183
he 0 331 183
can 0 331 183
dismiss 0 331 183
as 0 331 183
“gossip” 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
heartfelt 0 331 183
appeals 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
dozens 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
his 0 331 183
seminarians, 0 331 183
who 0 331 183
found 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
courage 0 331 183
to 0 331 183
write 0 331 183
to 0 331 183
him 0 331 183
after 0 331 183
one 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
them 0 331 183
tried 0 331 183
to 0 331 183
commit 0 331 183
suicide 0 331 183
over 0 331 183
homosexual 0 331 183

By 0 331 184
now 0 331 184
the 0 331 184
faithful 0 331 184
have 0 331 184
well 0 331 184
understood 0 331 184
Maradiaga’s 0 331 184
strategy: 0 331 184

The 0 331 191

to 0 331 191
the 0 331 191
bitter 0 331 191
end, 0 331 191
as 0 331 191
he 0 331 191
had 0 331 191
done 0 331 191
in 0 331 191
Chile 0 331 191

whom 0 331 191
he 0 331 191
himself 0 331 191
had 0 331 191
appointed 0 331 191
Bishop 0 331 191

Osorno 0 331 191

of 0 331 191
the 0 331 191
Chilean 0 331 191
Bishops. 0 331 191

First 0 331 192
he 0 331 192
insulted 0 331 192
the 0 331 192
abuse 0 331 192
victims. 0 331 192

Then, 0 331 193
only 0 331 193
when 0 331 193
he 0 331 193
was 0 331 193
forced 0 331 193
by 0 331 193
the 0 331 193
media, 0 331 193
and 0 331 193
a 0 331 193
revolt 0 331 193
by 0 331 193
the 0 331 193
Chilean 0 331 193
victims 0 331 193
and 0 331 193
faithful, 0 331 193
did 0 331 193
he 0 331 193
recognize 0 331 193
his 0 331 193
error 0 331 193
and 0 331 193
apologize, 0 331 193
while 0 331 193
stating 0 331 193
that 0 331 193
he 0 331 193
had 0 331 193
been 0 331 193
misinformed, 0 331 193
causing 0 331 193
a 0 331 193
disastrous 1 331 193
situation 0 331 193
for 0 331 193
the 0 331 193
Church 0 331 193
in 0 331 193
Chile, 0 331 193
but 0 331 193
continuing 0 331 193
to 0 331 193
protect 0 331 193
the 0 331 193
two 0 331 193
Chilean 0 331 193
Cardinals 0 331 193
Errazuriz 0 331 193
and 0 331 193
Ezzati. 0 331 193

Even 0 331 194
in 0 331 194
the 0 331 194
tragic 0 331 194
affair 0 331 194
of 0 331 194
McCarrick, 0 331 194
Pope 0 331 194
Francis’s 0 331 194
behavior 0 331 194
was 0 331 194
no 0 331 194
different. 0 331 194

He 0 331 195
knew 0 331 195
from 0 331 195
at 0 331 195
least 0 331 195
June 0 331 195
23, 0 331 195
2013 0 331 195
that 0 331 195
McCarrick 0 331 195
was 0 331 195
a 0 331 195
serial 1 331 195
predator. 1 331 195

Although 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
knew 0 331 196
that 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
was 0 331 196
a 0 331 196
corrupt 0 331 196
man, 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
covered 0 331 196
for 0 331 196
him 0 331 196
to 0 331 196
the 0 331 196
bitter 0 331 196
end; 0 331 196
indeed, 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
made 0 331 196
McCarrick’s 0 331 196
advice 0 331 196
his 0 331 196
own, 0 331 196
which 0 331 196
was 0 331 196
certainly 0 331 196
not 0 331 196
inspired 0 331 196
by 0 331 196
sound 0 331 196
intentions 0 331 196
and 0 331 196
for 0 331 196
love 0 331 196
of 0 331 196
the 0 331 196
Church. 0 331 196

It 0 331 197
was 0 331 197
only 0 331 197
when 0 331 197
he 0 331 197
was 0 331 197
forced 0 331 197
by 0 331 197
the 0 331 197
report 0 331 197
of 0 331 197
the 0 331 197
abuse 0 331 197
of 0 331 197
a 0 331 197
minor, 0 331 197
again 0 331 197
on 0 331 197
the 0 331 197
basis 0 331 197
of 0 331 197
media 0 331 197
attention, 0 331 197
that 0 331 197
he 0 331 197
took 0 331 197
action 0 331 197
[regarding 0 331 197
McCarrick] 0 331 197
to 0 331 197
save 0 331 197
his 0 331 197
image 0 331 197
in 0 331 197
the 0 331 197

Now 0 331 198
in 0 331 198
the 0 331 198
United 0 331 198
States 0 331 198
a 0 331 198
chorus 0 331 198
of 0 331 198
voices 0 331 198
is 0 331 198
rising 0 331 198
especially 0 331 198
from 0 331 198
the 0 331 198
lay 0 331 198
faithful, 0 331 198
and 0 331 198
has 0 331 198
recently 0 331 198
been 0 331 198
joined 0 331 198
by 0 331 198
several 0 331 198
bishops 0 331 198
and 0 331 198
priests, 0 331 198
asking 0 331 198
that 0 331 198
all 0 331 198
those 0 331 198
who, 0 331 198
by 0 331 198
their 0 331 198
silence, 0 331 198
covered 0 331 198
up 0 331 198
McCarrick’s 0 331 198
criminal 0 331 198
behavior, 0 331 198
or 0 331 198
who 0 331 198
used 0 331 198
him 0 331 198
to 0 331 198
advance 0 331 198
their 0 331 198
career 0 331 198

power 0 331 198
in 0 331 198
the 0 331 198
Church, 0 331 198
should 0 331 198
resign. 0 331 198

But 0 331 199
this 0 331 199
will 0 331 199
not 0 331 199
be 0 331 199
enough 0 331 199
to 0 331 199
heal 0 331 199
the 0 331 199
situation 0 331 199
of 0 331 199
extremely 1 331 199
grave 1 331 199
immoral 1 331 199
behavior 1 331 199
by 0 331 199
the 0 331 199
clergy: 0 331 199

The 0 331 201
virtue 0 331 201
of 0 331 201

we 0 331 214
tacitly 0 331 214
feed 0 331 214

someone 0 331 216

by 0 331 219
his 0 331 219
action 0 331 219
he 0 331 219
has 0 331 219
divided 0 331 219

the 0 331 220

moments 0 331 223
of 0 331 223
great 0 331 223
trial 0 331 223
that 0 331 223
the 0 331 223

I 0 333 24
show 0 333 24
in 0 333 24

book 0 333 24
The 0 333 24
History 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
Jihad 0 333 24
From 0 333 24
Muhammad 0 333 24
to 0 333 24
ISIS 0 333 24
, 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
great 0 333 24
caliphates 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
history, 0 333 24
from 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
immediate 0 333 24
post-Muhammad 0 333 24
period 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
“Rightly 0 333 24
Guided 0 333 24
Caliphs” 0 333 24
to 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
Umayyads, 0 333 24
Abbasids, 0 333 24
and 0 333 24
Ottomans, 0 333 24
as 0 333 24
well 0 333 24
as 0 333 24
other 0 333 24
Islamic 0 333 24
states, 0 333 24
all 0 333 24
waged 0 333 24
relentless 0 333 24
jihad 0 333 24
warfare 0 333 24
against 0 333 24
non-Muslims, 0 333 24
subjugating 0 333 24
them 0 333 24
under 0 333 24
the 0 333 24
rule 0 333 24
of 0 333 24
Islamic 0 333 24
law 0 333 24
and 0 333 24
denying 0 333 24
them 0 333 24
basic 0 333 24
rights. 0 333 24

These 0 333 25
weren’t 0 333 25
the 0 333 25
actions 0 333 25
of 0 333 25
a 1 333 25
“tiny 1 333 25
minority 1 333 25
of 1 333 25
extremists,” 1 333 25
abhorred 1 333 25
by 1 333 25
the 1 333 25
vast 1 333 25
majority 1 333 25
of 1 333 25
peaceful 1 333 25
Muslims 1 333 25
for 1 333 25
“hijacking” 1 333 25
their 1 333 25
religion. 1 333 25

This 0 333 26
was, 0 333 26
for 0 333 26
fourteen 0 333 26
centuries, 0 333 26
mainstream, 0 333 26
normative 0 333 26
Islam, 0 333 26
carried 0 333 26
forth 0 333 26
by 0 333 26
the 0 333 26
primary 0 333 26
authorities 0 333 26
in 0 333 26
the 0 333 26
Islamic 0 333 26
world 0 333 26
at 0 333 26
the 0 333 26
time. 0 333 26

The 0 333 27
History 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
Jihad 0 333 27
shows 0 333 27
from 0 333 27
the 0 333 27
accounts 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
eyewitnesses 0 333 27
and 0 333 27
contemporary 0 333 27
chroniclers 0 333 27
through 0 333 27
the 0 333 27
ages 0 333 27
that 0 333 27
in 0 333 27
every 0 333 27
age 0 333 27
and 0 333 27
in 0 333 27
every 0 333 27
place 0 333 27
where 0 333 27
there 0 333 27
were 0 333 27
Muslims, 0 333 27
some 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
them 0 333 27
believed 0 333 27
that 0 333 27
they 0 333 27
had 0 333 27
a 0 333 27
responsibility 0 333 27
given 0 333 27
to 0 333 27
them 0 333 27
by 0 333 27
Allah 0 333 27
to 0 333 27
wage 0 333 27
war 0 333 27
against 0 333 27
and 0 333 27
subjugate 0 333 27
unbelievers 0 333 27
under 0 333 27
the 0 333 27
rule 0 333 27
of 0 333 27
Islamic 0 333 27
law. 0 333 27

And 0 333 28
so 0 333 28
it 0 333 28
is 0 333 28
today: 0 333 28
Said 0 333 28
Khecharem 0 333 28
has 0 333 28
enunciated 0 333 28
that 0 333 28
responsibility 0 333 28
more 0 333 28
clearly 0 333 28
and 0 333 28
directly 0 333 28
than 0 333 28
most 0 333 28
Muslim 0 333 28
spokesmen 0 333 28
do 0 333 28
these 0 333 28
days, 0 333 28
but 0 333 28
he 0 333 28
is 0 333 28
by 0 333 28
no 0 333 28
means 0 333 28
the 0 333 28
only 0 333 28
one 0 333 28
who 0 333 28
believes 0 333 28
that 0 333 28
it 0 333 28
exists. 0 333 28

What 0 333 29
is 0 333 29
noteworthy 0 333 29
also 0 333 29
about 0 333 29
The 0 333 29
History 0 333 29
of 0 333 29
Jihad 0 333 29
is 0 333 29
something 0 333 29
that 0 333 29
it 0 333 29
does 0 333 29
not 0 333 29
contain. 0 333 29

As 0 333 30
the 0 333 30
jihadis 0 333 30
move 0 333 30
against 0 333 30
non-Muslim 0 333 30
states 0 333 30
without 0 333 30
any 0 333 30
letup, 0 333 30
pause, 0 333 30
period 0 333 30
of 0 333 30
coexistence, 0 333 30
period 0 333 30
of 0 333 30
tolerance, 0 333 30
reformation, 0 333 30
or 0 333 30
reconsideration, 0 333 30
there 0 333 30
never 0 333 30
appears 0 333 30
any 0 333 30
force 0 333 30
of 0 333 30
Muslims 0 333 30
to 0 333 30
oppose 0 333 30
them. 0 333 30

While 0 333 31
it 0 333 31
is 0 333 31
undoubtedly 0 333 31
true 0 333 31
that 0 333 31
not 0 333 31
all 0 333 31
Muslims 0 333 31
in 0 333 31
any 0 333 31
given 0 333 31
age 0 333 31
have 0 333 31
ever 0 333 31
waged 0 333 31
jihad, 0 333 31
there 0 333 31
has 0 333 31
never 0 333 31
been 0 333 31
in 0 333 31
Islamic 0 333 31
history 0 333 31
an 0 333 31
Islamic 0 333 31
entity 0 333 31
or 0 333 31
organization 0 333 31
that 0 333 31
was 0 333 31
opposed 0 333 31
to 0 333 31
waging 0 333 31
jihad 0 333 31
and 0 333 31
dedicated 0 333 31
to 0 333 31
stopping 0 333 31
those 0 333 31
who 0 333 31
were 0 333 31
waging 0 333 31
it. 0 333 31

So 0 333 32
it 0 333 32
is 0 333 32
today. 0 333 32

Remember, 0 336 40
you 0 336 40

Yeah, 0 336 42
well, 0 336 42
that's 1 336 42
about 1 336 42
as 1 336 42
trustworthy 1 336 42
as 1 336 42
the 1 336 42
FBI 1 336 42
in 1 336 42
this 1 336 42

This 0 336 43
latest 0 336 43
move, 0 336 43
while 0 336 43
welcome, 0 336 43
may 0 336 43
only 0 336 43
be 0 336 43
a 0 336 43
response 0 336 43
to 0 336 43
President 0 336 43
Donald 0 336 43
Trump's 0 336 43
vow 0 336 43
to 0 336 43
"get 0 336 43
involved." 0 336 43

However, 1 336 44
I 1 336 44
ask, 1 336 44
why 1 336 44
were 1 336 44
you 1 336 44
not 1 336 44
involved 1 336 44
in 1 336 44
the 1 336 44
first 1 336 44
place, 1 336 44
Mr. 1 336 44
President? 1 336 44

According 1 336 45
to 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
Constitution, 1 336 45
you, 1 336 45
and 1 336 45
you 1 336 45
alone, 1 336 45
are 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
sole 1 336 45
head 1 336 45
of 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
executive 1 336 45
branch, 1 336 45
and 1 336 45
as 1 336 45
such 1 336 45
you 1 336 45
are 1 336 45
where 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
buck 1 336 45
stop 1 336 45
in 1 336 45
making 1 336 45
sure 1 336 45
the 1 336 45
laws 1 336 45
are 1 336 45
faithfully 1 336 45

So, 0 336 46
if 0 336 46
Trump 0 336 46
is 0 336 46
going 0 336 46
to 0 336 46
fire 0 336 46
Sessions, 0 336 46
perhaps 1 336 46
he 1 336 46
should 1 336 46
stop 1 336 46
talking 1 336 46
about 1 336 46
it 1 336 46
and 1 336 46
get 1 336 46
to 1 336 46
it 1 336 46
and 1 336 46
actually 1 336 46
put 1 336 46

being 0 337 25
discriminated 0 337 25

Preliminary 0 339 17
information 0 339 17
suggests 0 339 17
that 0 339 17
the 0 339 17
officer 0 339 17
arrived 0 339 17
home 0 339 17
in 0 339 17
full 0 339 17
uniform 0 339 17
after 0 339 17
working 0 339 17
a 0 339 17
full 0 339 17
shift. 0 339 17

The 0 339 18
officer 0 339 18
reported 0 339 18
to 0 339 18
the 0 339 18
responding 0 339 18
officers 0 339 18
that 0 339 18
she 0 339 18
entered 0 339 18
the 0 339 18
victim’s 0 339 18
apartment 0 339 18
believing 0 339 18
that 0 339 18
it 0 339 18
was 0 339 18
her 0 339 18
own. 0 339 18

At 0 339 19
some 0 339 19
point, 0 339 19
the 0 339 19
officer 0 339 19
fired 0 339 19
her 0 339 19
weapon 0 339 19
striking 0 339 19
the 0 339 19
victim. 0 339 19

Responding 0 339 20
officers 0 339 20
administered 0 339 20
aid 0 339 20
to 0 339 20
the 0 339 20
victim, 0 339 20
a 0 339 20
26-year-old 0 339 20
male, 0 339 20
at 0 339 20
the 0 339 20
scene. 0 339 20

The 0 339 21
victim 0 339 21
was 0 339 21
then 0 339 21
transported 0 339 21
to 0 339 21

The 0 339 23

not 0 339 23
injured 0 339 23
and 0 339 23

investigation. 0 339 23

investigation 0 339 24
with 0 339 24
the 0 339 24
District 0 339 24
Attorney’s 0 339 24
Office. 0 339 24

This 0 339 25
investigation 0 339 25
is 0 339 25
ongoing 0 339 25
and 0 339 25
we 0 339 25
will 0 339 25
release 0 339 25
additional 0 339 25
details 0 339 25
as 0 339 25
they 0 339 25
become 0 339 25
available 0 339 25
and 0 339 25
it 0 339 25
is 0 339 25
appropriate 0 339 25
to 0 339 25
do 0 339 25
so. 0 339 25

If 0 339 26
an 0 339 26
average 0 339 26
citizen 0 339 26
walked 0 339 26
into 0 339 26
the 0 339 26
wrong 0 339 26
home 0 339 26
and 0 339 26
shot 0 339 26

killed 0 339 26
an 0 339 26
innocent 1 339 26
homeowner, 0 339 26
rest 0 339 26
assured 0 339 26
that 0 339 26
they 0 339 26
would 0 339 26
be 0 339 26
in 0 339 26
jail—right 0 339 26
now. 0 339 26

However, 0 339 27
instead 0 339 27
of 0 339 27
immediately 0 339 27
arresting 0 339 27
the 0 339 27
officer 0 339 27
for 0 339 27
trespassing 0 339 27
and 0 339 27
murder, 0 339 27
she 0 339 27
was 0 339 27
simply 0 339 27
placed 0 339 27
on 0 339 27
administrative 0 339 27
leave—a 0 339 27
glaring 1 339 27
function 0 339 27
of 0 339 27
blue 1 339 27
privilege 1 339 27
indeed. 0 339 27

“Super 1 339 28

this 0 339 32
is 0 339 32
the 0 339 32
first 0 339 32
time 0 339 32
we’ve 0 339 32
reported 0 339 32
a 0 339 32
story 0 339 32
of 0 339 32
an 0 339 32
off-duty 0 339 32
cop 0 339 32
going 0 339 32
into 0 339 32
the 0 339 32
wrong 0 339 32
home, 0 339 32
on 0 339 32
their 0 339 32
way 0 339 32
home, 0 339 32
and 0 339 32
killing 0 339 32
someone. 0 339 32

The 0 339 33
details 0 339 33
of 0 339 33
how 0 339 33
or 0 339 33
why 0 339 33
this 0 339 33
officer 0 339 33
would 0 339 33
walk 0 339 33
into 0 339 33
an 0 339 33
apartment 0 339 33
that 0 339 33
was 0 339 33
not 0 339 33
hers 0 339 33
are 0 339 33
unclear. 0 339 33

However, 0 339 34
what 0 339 34
is 0 339 34
entirely 0 339 34
clear 0 339 34
is 0 339 34
the 0 339 34
fact 0 339 34
that 0 339 34
a 0 339 34
mother 0 339 34
and 0 339 34
father 0 339 34
are 0 339 34
now 0 339 34
and 0 339 34
will 0 339 34
be 0 339 34
grieving 0 339 34
for 0 339 34
the 0 339 34
rest 0 339 34
of 0 339 34
their 0 339 34
lives 0 339 34
because 0 339 34
of 0 339 34
her 0 339 34
actions. 0 339 34

While 0 340 10
the 0 340 10
Obama 0 340 10
administration 0 340 10
continues 0 340 10
to 0 340 10

Muslim 0 340 10

to 0 340 10
direct 0 340 10
American 0 340 10

policy 0 340 10
and, 0 340 10
therefore, 0 340 10
to 0 340 10
implement 0 340 10
“strategies” 0 340 10
that 0 340 10
render 0 340 10
America 0 340 10
defenseless 0 340 10
in 0 340 10
the 0 340 10

stealth 1 340 10
Jihad, 1 340 10
there 0 340 10
are 0 340 10
some 0 340 10
alternative 0 340 10
strategies 0 340 10
that 0 340 10
have 0 340 10
the 0 340 10
potential 0 340 10
to 0 340 10
turn 0 340 10
this 0 340 10

around 0 340 10
completely 0 340 10
in 0 340 10
America’s 0 340 10
favor. 0 340 10

Below 1 340 11
are 1 340 11
9 1 340 11
concrete 1 340 11
steps 1 340 11
that, 1 340 11
if 1 340 11
implemented 1 340 11
by 1 340 11
a 1 340 11
future 1 340 11
American 1 340 11
administration, 1 340 11
would 1 340 11
make 1 340 11
a 1 340 11
big 1 340 11
difference 1 340 11
in 1 340 11
preserving 1 340 11
our 1 340 11
civilization 1 340 11
and 1 340 11
in 1 340 11

Americans 1 340 11
from 1 340 11
terrorism: 1 340 11

1. 0 340 12

Label 0 340 13
the 0 340 13
Enemy 0 340 13
and 0 340 13
Make 0 340 13
a 0 340 13
Threat 0 340 13
Assessment. 0 340 13

The 1 340 14
Obama 1 340 14
administration 1 340 14
continues 1 340 14
to 1 340 14
refuse 1 340 14
to 1 340 14
label 1 340 14
our 1 340 14
enemy 1 340 14
and, 1 340 14
therefore, 1 340 14
it 1 340 14
continues 1 340 14
to 1 340 14
enable 1 340 14
our 1 340 14
defeat 1 340 14
in 1 340 14
the 1 340 14
terror 1 340 14
war. 1 340 14

It 0 340 15
is 0 340 15
urgent 0 340 15
that 0 340 15
we 0 340 15
name 0 340 15
our 1 340 15
enemy 1 340 15
(i.e. 1 340 15

Islamic 1 340 16
Jihad) 1 340 16
and 0 340 16
definitively 0 340 16
identify 0 340 16
what 0 340 16
ideology 0 340 16
inspires 0 340 16
our 1 340 16
enemy 1 340 16
(i.e. 1 340 16

Islamic 1 340 17
law). 1 340 17

2. 0 340 18

Scrap 0 340 19
“Countering 1 340 19
Violent 1 340 19
Extremism.” 1 340 19

“Countering 1 340 20
Violent 1 340 20
Extremism” 1 340 20
is 0 340 20
the 0 340 20
pathetic 1 340 20
and 1 340 20
destructive 1 340 20
focus 0 340 20
of 0 340 20
the 0 340 20
Obama 0 340 20
administration 0 340 20
in 0 340 20
allegedly 0 340 20
fighting 0 340 20
the 0 340 20
terror 0 340 20
war. 0 340 20

On 0 340 21
the 0 340 21
one 0 340 21
hand, 0 340 21
this 0 340 21
“focus” 0 340 21
is 0 340 21
vague 0 340 21
to 0 340 21
the 0 340 21
point 0 340 21
of 0 340 21
being 0 340 21
meaningless 0 340 21
and 0 340 21
completely 1 340 21
incapacitates 1 340 21
us. 1 340 21

On 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
other 1 340 22
hand, 1 340 22
this 1 340 22
focus 1 340 22
allows 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
administration 1 340 22
to 1 340 22
perpetuate 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
destructive 1 340 22
fantasy 1 340 22
that 1 340 22
there 1 340 22
are 1 340 22
other 1 340 22
types 1 340 22
of 1 340 22
“extremists” 1 340 22
— 1 340 22
who 1 340 22
just 1 340 22
happen 1 340 22
to 1 340 22
be 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
Left’s 1 340 22
political 1 340 22
opponents 1 340 22
— 1 340 22
that 1 340 22
pose 1 340 22
a 1 340 22
great 1 340 22
threat 1 340 22
to 1 340 22
the 1 340 22
country. 1 340 22

For 0 340 23
example, 0 340 23
as 0 340 23
Stephen 0 340 23
Coughlin 0 340 23
has 0 340 23
revealed, 0 340 23
the 0 340 23
“violent 1 340 23
extremists” 1 340 23
the 0 340 23
administration 0 340 23
is 0 340 23
clearly 0 340 23
worried 0 340 23
about 0 340 23
are 0 340 23
the 0 340 23
“right-wing 1 340 23
Islamophobes” 1 340 23
whom 1 340 23
the 1 340 23
administration 1 340 23
obviously 1 340 23
considers 1 340 23
to 1 340 23
be 1 340 23
the 1 340 23
real 1 340 23
threat 1 340 23
to 1 340 23
American 1 340 23
security. 1 340 23

The 0 340 24
“Countering 1 340 24
Violent 1 340 24
Extremism” 1 340 24
is 1 340 24
trash 1 340 24
and 1 340 24
needs 1 340 24
to 1 340 24
be 1 340 24
thrown 1 340 24
in 1 340 24
the 1 340 24
garbage. 1 340 24

3. 0 340 25

Stop 0 340 26
“Partnering” 0 340 26
With 0 340 26
Muslim 0 340 26
Brotherhood 0 340 26
Front 0 340 26
Groups. 0 340 26

The 0 340 27
government 0 340 27
needs 0 340 27
to 0 340 27
stop 0 340 27
cooperating 0 340 27
with, 0 340 27
and 0 340 27
listening 0 340 27
to, 0 340 27
Muslim 0 340 27
Brotherhood 0 340 27
front 0 340 27
groups 0 340 27
such 0 340 27
as 0 340 27
CAIR 0 340 27
and 0 340 27
ISNA 0 340 27
immediately. 0 340 27

The 0 340 28
Muslim 0 340 28
Brotherhood 0 340 28
document, 0 340 28
the 0 340 28
Explanatory 0 340 28
Memorandum, 0 340 28
has 0 340 28
made 0 340 28
it 0 340 28
clear 0 340 28
that 0 340 28
the 0 340 28
Brotherhood’s 0 340 28
objective 0 340 28
is 0 340 28
to 1 340 28
destroy 1 340 28
our 1 340 28
civilization 1 340 28
from 1 340 28
within 1 340 28
by 0 340 28
our 0 340 28
own 0 340 28
hands 0 340 28
with 0 340 28
the 0 340 28
influence 0 340 28
of 0 340 28
these 0 340 28
groups. 0 340 28

Moreover, 0 340 29
as 1 340 29
Robert 1 340 29
Spencer 1 340 29
advises, 1 340 29
there 1 340 29
needs 1 340 29
to 1 340 29
be 1 340 29
legislation 1 340 29
that 1 340 29
will 1 340 29
bar 1 340 29
all 1 340 29
such 1 340 29
groups 1 340 29
and 1 340 29
affiliated 1 340 29
individuals 1 340 29
from 1 340 29
advising 1 340 29
the 1 340 29
government 1 340 29
or 1 340 29
receiving 1 340 29
any 1 340 29
grants 1 340 29
from 1 340 29
it. 1 340 29

4. 0 340 30

a 0 340 31
Concrete 0 340 31
“Countering-Jihad” 1 340 31

the 0 340 32
“Countering 1 340 32

a 0 340 32
concrete 0 340 32

It 0 340 33
must 0 340 33

register 0 340 33
that 0 340 33
Jihadists 1 340 33
are 0 340 33
the 0 340 33

that 0 340 33
Islamic 0 340 33

is 0 340 33
what 0 340 33
specifically 0 340 33

them. 0 340 33

Zilch. 1 340 40

Sebastian 1 340 41
Gorka 1 340 41
is 1 340 41
crucially 1 340 41
correct, 1 340 41
therefore, 1 340 41
when 1 340 41
he 1 340 41
recommends 1 340 41
a 1 340 41
national 1 340 41
counter-propaganda 1 340 41
campaign 1 340 41
that 1 340 41
involves 1 340 41
a 1 340 41
two-part 1 340 41
approach: 1 340 41
the 0 340 41
first 0 340 41
being 0 340 41
the 0 340 41
bolstering 0 340 41
of 0 340 41
efforts 0 340 41
to 0 340 41
define 0 340 41
our 0 340 41
enemy 0 340 41
(Steps 0 340 41
#1 0 340 41
and 0 340 41
#4 0 340 41
above) 0 340 41
and, 0 340 41
second, 0 340 41
the 0 340 41
strengthening 0 340 41
of 0 340 41
our 0 340 41
allies 0 340 41
and 0 340 41
partners 0 340 41
in 0 340 41
their 0 340 41
own 0 340 41
counter-propaganda 0 340 41
efforts 0 340 41
– 0 340 41
which 0 340 41
must 0 340 41
include 0 340 41
our 0 340 41
empowering 0 340 41
of 0 340 41
Muslims 0 340 41
who 0 340 41
are 0 340 41
trying 0 340 41
to 0 340 41
form 0 340 41
an 1 340 41
anti-Jihadist 1 340 41
version 1 340 41
of 1 340 41
Islam. 1 340 41

Consequently, 0 340 42
educational 0 340 42
programs 0 340 42
have 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
be 0 340 42
set 0 340 42
up 0 340 42
everywhere, 0 340 42
from 0 340 42
public 0 340 42
schools 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
universities 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
workplaces, 0 340 42
in 0 340 42
businesses 0 340 42
and 0 340 42
numerous 0 340 42
other 0 340 42
institutions. 0 340 42

These 0 340 43
programs 0 340 43
must 0 340 43
crystallize 0 340 43
what 0 340 43
exactly 0 340 43
Islamic 0 340 43
Law 0 340 43
is 0 340 43
and 0 340 43
how 0 340 43
it 0 340 43
inspires 0 340 43
and 0 340 43
sanctions 0 340 43
violence 0 340 43
against 0 340 43
unbelievers. 1 340 43

This 0 340 44
has 0 340 44
to 0 340 44
also 0 340 44
involve, 0 340 44
as 0 340 44
Gorka 0 340 44
urges, 0 340 44
“a 0 340 44
nationwide 0 340 44
program 0 340 44
of 0 340 44
education 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
includes 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
armed 0 340 44
services 0 340 44
as 0 340 44
well 0 340 44

and 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
intelligence 0 340 44
community.” 0 340 44

The 0 340 45
education 0 340 45
campaign 0 340 45
must 0 340 45
also 0 340 45
focus 0 340 45
on 0 340 45
the 0 340 45
second 0 340 45
part 0 340 45
of 0 340 45
Gorka’s 0 340 45
counter-propaganda 0 340 45
campaign, 0 340 45
which 0 340 45
is 0 340 45
to 0 340 45
help 0 340 45
strengthen 0 340 45
Muslims 0 340 45
who 0 340 45
seek 0 340 45
to 0 340 45
seize 0 340 45
Islam 0 340 45
from 0 340 45
the 1 340 45
jihadists’ 1 340 45
hands. 0 340 45

6. 0 340 46

Affirm 0 340 47
Sharia’s 0 340 47
Assault 0 340 47
on 0 340 47
the 0 340 47
U.S. 0 340 47
Constitution 0 340 47
as 0 340 47
Seditious. 0 340 47

Once 0 340 48
the 0 340 48
truth 0 340 48
is 0 340 48
accepted 0 340 48
that 0 340 48
jihadis 1 340 48
are 0 340 48
inspired 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
sanctioned 0 340 48
by 0 340 48
their 0 340 48
Islamic 0 340 48
texts, 0 340 48
it 0 340 48
must 0 340 48
logically 0 340 48
become 0 340 48
required 0 340 48
that 0 340 48
mosques, 0 340 48
Islamic 0 340 48
schools 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
groups 0 340 48
have 0 340 48
to 0 340 48
immediately 0 340 48
curtail 0 340 48
any 0 340 48
teaching 0 340 48
that 0 340 48
motivates 0 340 48
sedition, 0 340 48
violence, 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
hatred 0 340 48
of 0 340 48
unbelievers 1 340 48
(i.e. 0 340 48

remember 0 340 49
how 0 340 49
CAIR 0 340 49
advised 0 340 49
Muslims 0 340 49
not 0 340 49
to 0 340 49
talk 0 340 49
to 0 340 49
the 0 340 49
FBI). 0 340 49

Indeed, 0 340 50
once 0 340 50
the 0 340 50
government 0 340 50
discerns 0 340 50
and 0 340 50
labels 0 340 50
the 0 340 50
elements 0 340 50
of 0 340 50
Islamic 0 340 50
law 0 340 50
that 0 340 50

of 0 340 50
those 0 340 50
elements 0 340 50
in 0 340 50
America 0 340 50
must 0 340 50
be 0 340 50
labelled 0 340 50
as 0 340 50
seditious. 0 340 50

7. 0 340 51

Put 0 340 52
Pressure 0 340 52
on 0 340 52
Mosques, 0 340 52
Islamic 0 340 52
Groups 0 340 52
and 0 340 52
Schools. 0 340 52

Authorities 0 340 53
have 0 340 53
to 0 340 53
start 0 340 53
subjecting 0 340 53
mosques 0 340 53
and 0 340 53
other 0 340 53
Islamic 0 340 53
institutions 0 340 53
to 0 340 53
surveillance 0 340 53
— 0 340 53
and 0 340 53
discard 0 340 53
the 1 340 53
suicidal 1 340 53
leftist 1 340 53
notion 1 340 53
that 0 340 53
it 0 340 53
is 0 340 53
“racist” 0 340 53
and 0 340 53
Islamophobic 0 340 53
to 0 340 53
do 0 340 53
so. 0 340 53

Islamic 0 340 54
institutions 0 340 54
have 0 340 54
to 0 340 54
be 0 340 54
made 0 340 54
to 0 340 54
buffer 1 340 54
their 1 340 54
lip-service 1 340 54
against 1 340 54
terror 1 340 54
with 0 340 54
actually 0 340 54
doing 0 340 54
something 0 340 54
about 0 340 54
it. 0 340 54

As 1 340 55
Robert 1 340 55
Spencer 1 340 55
counsels, 1 340 55
this 0 340 55
has 0 340 55
to 0 340 55
involve 0 340 55
introducing 0 340 55
programs 0 340 55
that 0 340 55
teach 0 340 55
against 0 340 55
jihadists’ 1 340 55
understanding 0 340 55
of 0 340 55
Islam 0 340 55
— 0 340 55
and 0 340 55
these 0 340 55
programs 0 340 55
have 0 340 55
to 0 340 55
be 0 340 55
regularly 0 340 55
monitored 0 340 55
by 0 340 55
the 0 340 55
government. 0 340 55

(This 0 340 56
will 0 340 56
be 0 340 56
a 0 340 56
part 0 340 56
of 0 340 56
Gorka’s 0 340 56
suggested 0 340 56
counter-propaganda 0 340 56
campaign 0 340 56
discussed 0 340 56
in 0 340 56
Step 0 340 56
#5). 0 340 56

Spencer 0 340 57
rightly 0 340 57
stresses 0 340 57
that 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
paradigm 0 340 57
has 0 340 57
to 0 340 57
become 0 340 57
that 0 340 57
Muslim 0 340 57
communities 0 340 57
have 0 340 57
to 0 340 57
win 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
“trust” 0 340 57
of 0 340 57
intelligence 0 340 57
and 0 340 57
law 0 340 57
enforcement 0 340 57
agents, 0 340 57
rather 0 340 57
than 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
other 0 340 57
way 0 340 57
around, 0 340 57
which 0 340 57
is, 0 340 57
absurdly 1 340 57
and 1 340 57
tragically, 1 340 57
the 0 340 57
case 0 340 57
right 0 340 57
now. 0 340 57

8. 0 340 58

Bring 0 340 59
Counter-Jihadists 1 340 59
into 0 340 59
the 0 340 59
Government. 0 340 59

Instead 0 340 60
of 0 340 60
having 0 340 60
Muslim 0 340 60

circumstances), 0 340 61
and 0 340 61

we 1 340 61
need 1 340 61
to 1 340 61
bring 1 340 61
in 1 340 61
people 1 340 61
who 1 340 61
actually 1 340 61
love 1 340 61
America 1 340 61
and 1 340 61
want 1 340 61
to 1 340 61
protect 1 340 61
it. 1 340 61

We 0 340 62
all 0 340 62

are 0 340 62
referenced 0 340 62
in 0 340 62
this 0 340 62
article. 0 340 62

The 0 340 63
government 0 340 63
must 0 340 63
also 0 340 63
bring 0 340 63
in 0 340 63
brave 1 340 63
Muslim 1 340 63
individuals 1 340 63
who 1 340 63
genuinely 1 340 63
reject 1 340 63
Jihad 1 340 63
and 0 340 63
empower 0 340 63
them 0 340 63
in 0 340 63
propagating 0 340 63
their 0 340 63
anti-jihadist 1 340 63
vision 1 340 63
for 0 340 63
Islam. 0 340 63

(P.S. 0 340 64

Yes, 0 340 65
there 0 340 65
is 0 340 65
an 0 340 65
argument 0 340 65
to 0 340 65
be 0 340 65
made 0 340 65
that 0 340 65
Islam 1 340 65
cannot 1 340 65
be 1 340 65
Islam 1 340 65
without 1 340 65

But 0 340 66
the 0 340 66
debate 0 340 66
over 0 340 66
this 0 340 66

And 0 340 67
whatever 0 340 67
the 0 340 67

it 0 340 67

to 0 342 26
“fund” 0 342 26
the 0 342 26

wants 0 342 26
to 0 342 26
be 0 342 26
a 0 342 26
“head 0 342 26
outside 0 342 26

to 0 342 26
Robby 0 342 26
Mook 0 342 26
we 0 342 26
learned 0 342 26
that: 0 342 26

I 0 342 27
met 0 342 27
with 0 342 27
Eric 0 342 27
Schmidt 0 342 27
tonight. 0 342 27

As 0 342 28
David 0 342 28
reported, 0 342 28
he’s 0 342 28
ready 0 342 28
to 0 342 28
fund, 0 342 28
advise 0 342 28
recruit 0 342 28
talent, 0 342 28
etc. 0 342 28

He 0 342 29
was 0 342 29
more 0 342 29
deferential 0 342 29
on 0 342 29
structure 0 342 29
than 0 342 29
I 0 342 29
expected. 0 342 29

Wasn’t 0 342 30
pushing 0 342 30
to 0 342 30
run 0 342 30
through 0 342 30
one 0 342 30
of 0 342 30
his 0 342 30
existing 0 342 30
firms. 0 342 30

Clearly 0 342 31
wants 0 342 31
to 0 342 31
be 0 342 31
head 0 342 31
outside 0 342 31
advisor, 0 342 31
but 0 342 31
didn’t 0 342 31
seem 0 342 31
like 0 342 31
he 0 342 31
wanted 0 342 31
to 0 342 31
push 0 342 31
others 0 342 31
out. 0 342 31

Clearly 0 342 32
wants 0 342 32
to 0 342 32
get 0 342 32
going. 0 342 32

He’s 0 342 33
still 0 342 33
in 0 342 33
DC 0 342 33
tomorrow 0 342 33
and 0 342 33
would 0 342 33
like 0 342 33
to 0 342 33
meet 0 342 33
with 0 342 33
you 0 342 33
if 0 342 33
you 0 342 33
are 0 342 33
in 0 342 33
DC 0 342 33
in 0 342 33
the 0 342 33
afternoon. 0 342 33

I 0 342 34
think 0 342 34
it’s 0 342 34
worth 0 342 34
doing. 0 342 34

You 0 342 35
around? 0 342 35

If 0 342 36
you 0 342 36
are, 0 342 36
and 0 342 36
want 0 342 36
to 0 342 36
meet 0 342 36
with 0 342 36
him, 0 342 36
maybe 0 342 36
the 0 342 36
four 0 342 36
of 0 342 36
us 0 342 36
can 0 342 36
get 0 342 36

the 0 345 25
FBI 0 345 25
said 0 345 25
in 0 345 25
a 0 345 25
statement. 0 345 25

The 0 345 26
White 0 345 26
House 0 345 26
has 0 345 26
called 0 345 26
this 0 345 26
nothing 0 345 26
more 0 345 26
than 0 345 26
a 0 345 26
last 1 345 26
minute 1 345 26

and 0 345 26
that 0 345 26
would 0 345 26
be 0 345 26
correct. 0 345 26

In 0 345 27
fact, 0 345 27
the 0 345 27
FBI 0 345 27
has 0 345 27
no 0 345 27
plans 0 345 27
to 0 345 27
pursue 0 345 27
any 0 345 27

to 0 345 28
The 0 345 28
Washington 0 345 28
Post: 0 345 28

According 0 345 29
to 0 345 29
a 0 345 29
person 0 345 29
familiar 0 345 29
with 0 345 29
the 0 345 29
matter, 0 345 29
the 0 345 29
FBI 0 345 29
does 0 345 29
not 0 345 29
now 0 345 29
plan 0 345 29
to 0 345 29
launch 0 345 29
a 0 345 29
criminal 0 345 29
investigation 0 345 29
of 0 345 29
the 0 345 29
matter, 0 345 29
which 0 345 29
would 0 345 29
normally 0 345 29
be 0 345 29
handled 0 345 29
by 0 345 29
local 0 345 29
authorities, 0 345 29
if 0 345 29
it 0 345 29
was 0 345 29
within 0 345 29
the 0 345 29
statute 0 345 29
of 0 345 29
limitations. 0 345 29

The 0 345 30
FBI 0 345 30
instead 0 345 30
passed 0 345 30
the 0 345 30
material 0 345 30
to 0 345 30
the 0 345 30
White 0 345 30

had 0 345 30
been 0 345 30
completed, 0 345 30
the 0 345 30
person 0 345 30
said. 0 345 30

The 0 345 31
move 0 345 31
is 0 345 31
similar 0 345 31
to 0 345 31
what 0 345 31

“Let 0 345 33

straight: 0 345 33

sarcastically. 0 345 34

Exactly! 0 345 36

This 0 345 37
is 0 345 37
political 1 345 37

over 0 345 37
a 0 345 37
man 0 345 37

is 0 345 37

not 0 345 37
a 0 345 37

He's 1 345 38
a 1 345 38
precedence 1 345 38
man! 1 345 38

He's 0 345 39
said 0 345 39
it 0 345 39
over 0 345 39
and 0 345 39
over! 0 345 39

If 0 345 40
they 0 345 40
wanted 0 345 40
something 0 345 40
on 0 345 40
the 0 345 40

why 1 345 40

that 0 345 41

be 0 345 41
something 0 345 41
to 0 345 41
really 0 345 41

Dallas 0 347 1
Police 0 347 1
on 0 347 1
Thursday 0 347 1
announced 0 347 1
the 0 347 1
findings 0 347 1
of 0 347 1
a 0 347 1
search 0 347 1
warrant 0 347 1
they 0 347 1
executed 0 347 1
on 0 347 1
the 0 347 1
home 0 347 1
of 0 347 1
Botham 0 347 1
Jean 0 347 1
after 0 347 1
he 0 347 1
was 0 347 1
gunned 0 347 1
down 0 347 1
in 0 347 1
his 0 347 1
apartment 0 347 1
by 0 347 1
one 0 347 1
of 0 347 1
their 0 347 1
own. 0 347 1

The 0 347 2
department 0 347 2
is 0 347 2
now 0 347 2
accused 0 347 2
of 0 347 2
trying 0 347 2
to 0 347 2
“smear” 1 347 2
Jean 0 347 2
by 0 347 2
claiming 0 347 2
they 0 347 2
found 0 347 2
a 0 347 2
tiny 1 347 2
bit 1 347 2
of 0 347 2
marijuana 0 347 2
in 0 347 2
his 0 347 2
house—as 0 347 2
if 0 347 2
this 0 347 2
justifies 0 347 2
going 0 347 2
into 0 347 2
someone’s 0 347 2
home 0 347 2
and 0 347 2
murdering 0 347 2
them. 0 347 2

The 0 347 3
timing 0 347 3
couldn’t 0 347 3
have 0 347 3
been 0 347 3
more 0 347 3
insidiously 0 347 3
planned 0 347 3
as 0 347 3
police 0 347 3
released 0 347 3
the 0 347 3
affidavit 0 347 3
on 0 347 3
the 0 347 3
day 0 347 3

Jean’s 0 347 3
funeral—despite 0 347 3
having 0 347 3
allegedly 0 347 3
found 0 347 3
the 0 347 3
marijuana 0 347 3
last 0 347 3
week. 0 347 3

According 0 347 4
to 0 347 4
the 0 347 4
affidavit, 0 347 4
when 0 347 4
they 0 347 4
searched 0 347 4
his 0 347 4
home, 0 347 4
police 0 347 4
claimed 0 347 4
to 0 347 4
have 0 347 4
found 0 347 4
10.4 0 347 4
grams 0 347 4
of 0 347 4
pot—less 0 347 4
than 0 347 4
half 0 347 4
an 0 347 4
ounce. 0 347 4

Police 0 347 5
also 0 347 5
said 0 347 5
they 0 347 5
found 0 347 5
two 0 347 5
fired 0 347 5
cartridge 0 347 5
casings, 0 347 5
a 0 347 5

a 0 347 5
metal 0 347 5
marijuana 0 347 5
grinder—the 0 347 5
horror. 1 347 5

Even 1 347 6
if 1 347 6
police 1 347 6
did 1 347 6
find 1 347 6
marijuana, 1 347 6
why 1 347 6

that 0 347 19

said 0 347 21
Merritt. 0 347 21

Merritt 0 347 22
accused 0 347 22
the 0 347 22
department 0 347 22
of 0 347 22

a 0 347 22

that 0 347 22
we 0 347 22
often 0 347 22

Sadly, 0 347 22
he 0 347 22
appears 0 347 22
to 0 347 22
be 0 347 22
correct 0 347 22
in 0 347 22
his 0 347 22
accusations. 0 347 22

It 0 347 23
is 0 347 23
standard 0 347 23
procedure 0 347 23
for 0 347 23

in 0 347 23
the 0 347 23
public 0 347 23
eye. 0 347 23

Even 0 347 24
sadder, 0 347 24
however, 0 347 24
is 0 347 24
the 0 347 24
fact 0 347 24
that 0 347 24
these 0 347 24

From 0 354 15
the 0 354 15
beginning 0 354 15
of 0 354 15
this 0 354 15
case, 0 354 15
it 0 354 15
was 0 354 15
clear 0 354 15
that 0 354 15
Guyger 0 354 15
was 0 354 15
receiving 0 354 15
special 0 354 15
treatment 0 354 15
from 0 354 15
law 0 354 15

glaring 1 354 16
instances 0 354 16
showing 0 354 16
her 0 354 16

was 0 354 16
the 0 354 16
fact 0 354 16
that 0 354 16
the 0 354 16
Texas 0 354 16
Rangers 0 354 16
said 0 354 16
in 0 354 16
their 0 354 16

that 0 354 16

do 0 354 16
you 0 354 16

that 0 354 16

Stephen 0 354 17
Le 0 354 17
Brocq, 0 354 17
who 0 354 17
operates 0 354 17
a 0 354 17
law 0 354 17
firm 0 354 17
in 0 354 17
the 0 354 17
North 0 354 17
Texas 0 354 17
area 0 354 17
sums 0 354 17
up 0 354 17
the 0 354 17
treatment 0 354 17
of 0 354 17
Guyger 0 354 17
perfectly 0 354 17
when 0 354 17
he 0 354 17
says 0 354 17
that 0 354 17
“The 0 354 17
affidavit 0 354 17
isn’t 0 354 17
written 0 354 17
objectively, 0 354 17
not 0 354 17
at 0 354 17
the 0 354 17
slightest. 0 354 17

As 0 354 18
stated 0 354 18
before, 0 354 18
they 0 354 18
are 0 354 18
usually 0 354 18
wholly 0 354 18
against 0 354 18
the 0 354 18
accused. 0 354 18

An 0 354 19
objective 0 354 19
view 0 354 19
of 0 354 19
the 0 354 19
information 0 354 19
related 0 354 19
by 0 354 19
the 0 354 19
officer 0 354 19
would 0 354 19
be 0 354 19
proper, 0 354 19
in 0 354 19
my 0 354 19
opinion. 0 354 19

This 0 354 20
affidavit 0 354 20
states 0 354 20
facts 0 354 20
based 0 354 20
upon 0 354 20
the 0 354 20
word 0 354 20
of 0 354 20
the 0 354 20
person 0 354 20
it 0 354 20
seeks 0 354 20
to 0 354 20
accuse 0 354 20
of 0 354 20
criminal 0 354 20
wrongdoing.” 0 354 20

What’s 0 354 21
more, 0 354 21
according 0 354 21
to 0 354 21
WFAA, 0 354 21
who 0 354 21
obtained 0 354 21
affidavits 0 354 21
for 0 354 21
all 0 354 21
of 0 354 21
the 0 354 21
search 0 354 21
warrants 0 354 21
involved 0 354 21
in 0 354 21
the 0 354 21
case, 0 354 21
none 0 354 21
of 0 354 21
them 0 354 21
involved 0 354 21
the 0 354 21
search 0 354 21
of 0 354 21
Guyger’s 0 354 21
apartment. 0 354 21

For 0 354 22
those 0 354 22
who 0 354 22
don’t 0 354 22
recall, 0 354 22
police 0 354 22
egregiously 1 354 22
released 0 354 22
the 0 354 22
search 0 354 22
warrant 0 354 22
findings 0 354 22
of 0 354 22
Jean’s 0 354 22
apartment 0 354 22
on 0 354 22
the 0 354 22
day 0 354 22
his 0 354 22
family 0 354 22
buried 0 354 22
his 0 354 22
dead 0 354 22
body. 0 354 22

They 0 354 23
attempted 0 354 23
to 0 354 23
assassinate 0 354 23
Jean’s 0 354 23
character 0 354 23
by 0 354 23
claiming 0 354 23
they 0 354 23
found 0 354 23
less 0 354 23
than 0 354 23
a 0 354 23
half 0 354 23
ounce 0 354 23
of 0 354 23
weed 0 354 23
in 0 354 23
his 0 354 23
apartment. 0 354 23

However, 0 354 24
they 0 354 24
failed 0 354 24
miserably 1 354 24
at 0 354 24
it. 0 354 24

One 0 354 25
thing 0 354 25
in 0 354 25
particular, 0 354 25
however, 0 354 25
stood 0 354 25
out 0 354 25
to 0 354 25
those 0 354 25
paying 0 354 25
attention 0 354 25
and 0 354 25
that 0 354 25
is 0 354 25
the 0 354 25
fact 0 354 25
the 0 354 25
police 0 354 25
didn’t 0 354 25
release 0 354 25
any 0 354 25
information 0 354 25
on 0 354 25
what 0 354 25
they 0 354 25
found 0 354 25
in 0 354 25
Guyger’s 0 354 25
apartment. 0 354 25

According 0 354 26
to 0 354 26
the 0 354 26
information 0 354 26
currently 0 354 26
available, 0 354 26
that’s 0 354 26
because 0 354 26
they 0 354 26
didn’t 0 354 26
search 0 354 26
it. 0 354 26

According 0 354 27
to 0 354 27
WFAA, 0 354 27
there 0 354 27
were 0 354 27
five 0 354 27
search 0 354 27
warrants 0 354 27
issued 0 354 27
in 0 354 27
the 0 354 27
case—none 0 354 27
of 0 354 27
which 0 354 27
were 0 354 27
for 0 354 27
the 0 354 27
killer’s 0 354 27
apartment. 0 354 27

As 0 354 28
WFAA 0 354 28
reports: 0 354 28

Two 0 354 29
of 0 354 29
the 0 354 29
warrants 0 354 29
allowed 0 354 29
investigators 0 354 29
to 0 354 29
remove 0 354 29
the 0 354 29
front 0 354 29
door 0 354 29
of 0 354 29
Guyger 0 354 29
and 0 354 29
Jean’s 0 354 29
apartment, 0 354 29
their 0 354 29
door 0 354 29
locks 0 354 29
and 0 354 29
to 0 354 29
download 0 354 29
data 0 354 29
for 0 354 29
their 0 354 29
door 0 354 29
locks. 0 354 29

An 0 354 30
inventory 0 354 30
return 0 354 30
states 0 354 30
that 0 354 30
they 0 354 30
removed 0 354 30
both 0 354 30
of 0 354 30
their 0 354 30
door 0 354 30
lock 0 354 30
and 0 354 30
downloaded 0 354 30
the 0 354 30
data 0 354 30
from 0 354 30
the 0 354 30
door 0 354 30
locks. 0 354 30

A 0 354 31
third 0 354 31
search 0 354 31
warrant 0 354 31
gave 0 354 31
investigators 0 354 31
the 0 354 31
authority 0 354 31
to 0 354 31
enter 0 354 31

I 0 355 2
never 0 355 2
thought 0 355 2
I’d 0 355 2
see 0 355 2
the 0 355 2
day 0 355 2
when 0 355 2
a 1 355 2

often 1 355 2
unprintable 1 355 2
invective 1 355 2
against 0 355 2
traditionalists, 0 355 2
would 0 355 2
unload 1 355 2
on 1 355 2
Pope 1 355 2
Bergoglio 1 355 2
with 0 355 2
the 0 355 2
following 0 355 2
headline: 0 355 2
“Does 1 355 2

The 0 355 3
scales 0 355 3
have 0 355 3
fallen 0 355 3
from 0 355 3
Fisher’s 0 355 3
eyes 0 355 3
and 0 355 3
now, 0 355 3
at 0 355 3
last, 0 355 3
she 0 355 3
sees 0 355 3
Bergoglio, 0 355 3
however 0 355 3
grudgingly, 0 355 3
for 0 355 3
what 0 355 3
he 0 355 3
is: 0 355 3
a 1 355 3
power-mad 1 355 3
ecclesiastical 1 355 3
tyrant. 1 355 3

(A 0 355 4
tyrant, 0 355 4
moreover, 0 355 4
who 0 355 4
has 0 355 4
ascended 0 355 4
to 0 355 4
the 0 355 4
papacy 0 355 4
in 0 355 4
a 0 355 4
manner 0 355 4
reminiscent 0 355 4
of 0 355 4
the 0 355 4
ascension 0 355 4
of 0 355 4

to 1 355 4

the 0 355 4
machinations 0 355 4
of 0 355 4
a 0 355 4
Roman 0 355 4
cabal, 0 355 4
as 0 355 4
I 0 355 4
discuss 0 355 4
below.) 0 355 4

Quoth 0 355 5
Fisher: 0 355 5

I 0 355 6
have 0 355 6
a 0 355 6
number 0 355 6
of 0 355 6
friends 0 355 6
who 0 355 6
have 0 355 6
escaped 0 355 6
abusive 0 355 6
marriages. 0 355 6

They 0 355 7
tell 0 355 7
me 0 355 7
that 0 355 7
Pope 1 355 7
Francis 1 355 7
is 1 355 7
sounding 1 355 7
more 1 355 7
and 1 355 7
more 1 355 7
like 1 355 7
the 1 355 7
men 1 355 7
who 1 355 7
abused 1 355 7
them. 1 355 7

He’s 1 355 8
sounding 1 355 8
like 1 355 8
the 1 355 8
men 1 355 8
who 1 355 8
hid 1 355 8
that 1 355 8
abuse 1 355 8
from 1 355 8
the 1 355 8
world, 1 355 8
who 1 355 8
taught 1 355 8
their 1 355 8
victims 1 355 8
to 1 355 8
blame 1 355 8
themselves, 1 355 8
who 1 355 8
used 1 355 8
spiritual 1 355 8
pressure 1 355 8
to 1 355 8
persuade 1 355 8
them 1 355 8
and 1 355 8
their 1 355 8
families 1 355 8
that 1 355 8
it 1 355 8
would 1 355 8
actually 1 355 8
be 1 355 8
wrong, 1 355 8
sinful, 1 355 8
to 1 355 8
defend 1 355 8
themselves. 1 355 8

Just 0 355 9
listen 0 355 9
to 0 355 9
him. 0 355 9

After 0 355 10
responding 0 355 10
to 0 355 10
a 0 355 10
question 0 355 10
about 0 355 10
Vigano’s 0 355 10
very 0 355 10
serious 0 355 10
accusations, 0 355 10
he 0 355 10
said 0 355 10
point 0 355 10
blank, 0 355 10
“I 0 355 10
will 0 355 10
not 0 355 10
say 0 355 10
a 0 355 10
single 0 355 10
word 0 355 10
on 0 355 10
this.”… 0 355 10
[F]or 0 355 10
the 0 355 10
rest 0 355 10
of 0 355 10
the 0 355 10
week 0 355 10
and 0 355 10
more, 0 355 10
he 0 355 10
kept 0 355 10
up 0 355 10
an 0 355 10
unmistakable 0 355 10
theme 0 355 10
of 0 355 10
calling 0 355 10
for 0 355 10
silence, 0 355 10
equating 0 355 10
silence 0 355 10
with 0 355 10
holiness, 0 355 10
and 0 355 10
painting 0 355 10
himself 0 355 10
as 0 355 10
a 1 355 10
Christlike 1 355 10
victim 1 355 10
in 0 355 10
his 0 355 10
silence. 0 355 10

Then 0 355 11
he 0 355 11
says 0 355 11
it’s 0 355 11
“ugly” 0 355 11
to 0 355 11
accuse 0 355 11
others 0 355 11
of 0 355 11
sinning. 0 355 11

Then 0 355 12
he 0 355 12
suggests 0 355 12
that 0 355 12
healing 1 355 12
and 1 355 12
reconciliation 1 355 12
will 1 355 12
only 1 355 12
come 1 355 12
if 1 355 12
we 1 355 12
take 1 355 12
a 1 355 12
hard 1 355 12
look 1 355 12
at 1 355 12
our 1 355 12
own 1 355 12
flaws…. 1 355 12

To 1 355 13
the 1 355 13
victims 1 355 13
of 1 355 13
the 1 355 13
Church, 1 355 13
and 1 355 13
to 1 355 13
those 1 355 13
who 1 355 13
love 1 355 13
them, 1 355 13
it 1 355 13
sounds 1 355 13
like 1 355 13
he 1 355 13
is 1 355 13
saying, 1 355 13
“Who 1 355 13
do 1 355 13
you 1 355 13
think 1 355 13
you 1 355 13
are? 1 355 13

I 1 355 14
don’t 1 355 14
have 1 355 14
to 1 355 14
explain 1 355 14
myself 1 355 14
to 1 355 14
you. 1 355 14

You’re 1 355 15
the 1 355 15
guilty 1 355 15
one. 1 355 15

You 1 355 16
brought 1 355 16
this 1 355 16
on 1 355 16
yourself. 1 355 16

If 1 355 17
you 1 355 17
want 1 355 17
to 1 355 17
be 1 355 17
loved, 1 355 17
then 1 355 17
know 1 355 17
your 1 355 17
place. 1 355 17

I’m 1 355 18
the 1 355 18
victim, 1 355 18
here, 1 355 18
not 1 355 18
you. 1 355 18

If 1 355 19
you 1 355 19
know 1 355 19
what’s 1 355 19
good 1 355 19
for 1 355 19
you, 1 355 19
keep 1 355 19
your 1 355 19
mouth 1 355 19
shut.” 1 355 19
This 1 355 19
is 1 355 19
how 1 355 19
abusers 1 355 19
talk. 1 355 19

They’re 1 355 20
not 1 355 20
content 1 355 20
with 1 355 20
power; 1 355 20
they 1 355 20
have 1 355 20
to 1 355 20
keep 1 355 20
their 1 355 20
victims 1 355 20
doubting 1 355 20
and 1 355 20
blaming 1 355 20
themselves 1 355 20
constantly, 1 355 20
so 1 355 20
they 1 355 20
don’t 1 355 20
become 1 355 20
a 1 355 20
threat. 1 355 20

Whether 1 355 21
Francis 1 355 21
knows 1 355 21
it 1 355 21
or 1 355 21
not, 1 355 21
this 1 355 21
is 1 355 21
how 1 355 21
he 1 355 21
sounds. 1 355 21

We 0 355 22
can 0 355 22
overlook 0 355 22
the 0 355 22
fig 0 355 22
leaf 0 355 22
“whether 0 355 22
Francis 0 355 22
knows 0 355 22
it 0 355 22
or 0 355 22
not…”. 0 355 22

Fisher 1 355 23
knows 1 355 23
that 1 355 23
Francis 1 355 23
knows 1 355 23
it, 1 355 23
even 1 355 23
if 1 355 23
she 1 355 23
still 1 355 23
cannot 1 355 23
bring 1 355 23
herself 1 355 23
to 1 355 23
say 1 355 23
explicitly 1 355 23
what 1 355 23
should 1 355 23
now 1 355 23
be 1 355 23
apparent 1 355 23
to 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
entire 1 355 23
body 1 355 23
of 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
faithful: 1 355 23
that 0 355 23
Bergoglio’s 1 355 23
very 1 355 23
presence 1 355 23
on 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
Chair 1 355 23
of 1 355 23
Peter 1 355 23
is 1 355 23
a 1 355 23
grave 1 355 23
threat 1 355 23
to 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
common 1 355 23
good 1 355 23
of 1 355 23
the 1 355 23
Church 1 355 23

Faith. 1 355 23

Yet 0 355 25
Fisher 0 355 25
maintains 0 355 25
a 0 355 25
sliver 0 355 25
of 0 355 25
space 0 355 25
for 0 355 25
deniability 0 355 25
in 0 355 25
order 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
maintain 0 355 25
that 0 355 25
indispensable 0 355 25
distinction 0 355 25
between 0 355 25
her 0 355 25
and 0 355 25
those 1 355 25
loathsome 1 355 25
traditionalists: 1 355 25
“I 0 355 25
don’t 0 355 25
have 0 355 25
any 0 355 25
ideological 0 355 25
reason 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
want 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
bring 0 355 25
him 0 355 25
down. 0 355 25

I 0 355 26
have 0 355 26
defended 0 355 26
him 0 355 26
as 0 355 26
long 0 355 26
as 0 355 26
I 0 355 26
could, 0 355 26
up 0 355 26
until 0 355 26
the 0 355 26
Chile 0 355 26
debacle. 0 355 26

And 0 355 27
so 0 355 27
I 0 355 27
am 0 355 27
working 0 355 27
as 0 355 27
hard 0 355 27
as 0 355 27
I 0 355 27
can 0 355 27
not 0 355 27
to 0 355 27
assume 0 355 27
the 0 355 27
worst, 0 355 27
not 0 355 27
to 0 355 27
believe 0 355 27
that 0 355 27
this 1 355 27
man 1 355 27
who 1 355 27
promised 1 355 27
so 1 355 27
much 1 355 27
fresh 1 355 27
air 1 355 27
is 1 355 27
really 1 355 27
so 1 355 27
intent 1 355 27
on 1 355 27
slamming 1 355 27
doors 1 355 27
shut 1 355 27
before 1 355 27
we 1 355 27
find 1 355 27
out 1 355 27
even 1 355 27
worse 1 355 27
things 1 355 27
hidden 1 355 27
inside. 1 355 27

But 1 355 28
he 1 355 28
is 1 355 28
not 1 355 28
making 1 355 28
it 1 355 28
easy. 1 355 28

I 1 355 29
am 1 355 29
not 1 355 29
saying 1 355 29
he 1 355 29
is 1 355 29
an 1 355 29
abuser. 1 355 29

But 1 355 30
he 1 355 30
sounds 1 355 30
like 1 355 30
one.” 1 355 30

That 0 355 31
is, 0 355 31
Fisher 0 355 31
was 0 355 31
not 0 355 31
concerned 0 355 31
about 0 355 31
Bergoglio’s 0 355 31
relentless 1 355 31
assault 1 355 31
on 0 355 31
traditional 0 355 31
Catholic 0 355 31
teaching 0 355 31
and 0 355 31
practice—to 0 355 31
her, 0 355 31
opposition 0 355 31
to 0 355 31
Francis 0 355 31
on 0 355 31
that 0 355 31
account 0 355 31
is 0 355 31
just 0 355 31
“ideology”—but 0 355 31
only 0 355 31
his 0 355 31
role 0 355 31
in 0 355 31
covering 0 355 31
up 0 355 31
sexual 0 355 31
abuse 0 355 31
by 0 355 31
bishops 0 355 31
and 0 355 31
priests. 0 355 31

But 0 355 32
why 0 355 32
is 0 355 32
Fisher 0 355 32
still 0 355 32
“working 0 355 32
hard 0 355 32
not 0 355 32
to 0 355 32
assume 0 355 32
the 0 355 32
worst” 0 355 32
when 0 355 32
there 0 355 32
is 0 355 32
no 0 355 32
longer 0 355 32
anything 0 355 32
to 0 355 32
assume 0 355 32
as 0 355 32
the 0 355 32
ever-mounting 0 355 32
evidence 0 355 32
of 0 355 32
malintent 0 355 32
has 0 355 32
been 0 355 32
in 0 355 32
plain 0 355 32
view 0 355 32
for 0 355 32
years? 0 355 32

Indeed, 0 355 33
why 0 355 33
else 0 355 33
did 0 355 33
Archbishop 0 355 33
Viganò 0 355 33
risk 1 355 33
everything 1 355 33
in 0 355 33
order 0 355 33
to 0 355 33
expose 0 355 33
this 0 355 33
Pope, 0 355 33
even 0 355 33
to 0 355 33
the 0 355 33
extent 0 355 33
of 0 355 33
revealing 0 355 33
matters 0 355 33
supposedly 0 355 33
within 0 355 33
the 0 355 33
scope 0 355 33
of 0 355 33
“the 0 355 33
Pontifical 0 355 33
secret”? 0 355 33

On 0 355 34
orders 0 355 34
of 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
Vatican 0 355 34
Secretary 0 355 34
of 0 355 34
State, 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
Vatican 0 355 34
secret 0 355 34
police 0 355 34
are 0 355 34
reportedly 0 355 34
scouring 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
globe 0 355 34
in 0 355 34
search 0 355 34
of 0 355 34
Viganò, 0 355 34
who 0 355 34
has 0 355 34
gone 0 355 34
into 0 355 34
hiding, 0 355 34
“in 0 355 34
order 0 355 34
to 0 355 34
prevent 0 355 34
more 0 355 34
unpredictable 0 355 34
damage 0 355 34
to 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
image 0 355 34
of 0 355 34
Pope 0 355 34
Francis 0 355 34
and 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
Holy 0 355 34
See 0 355 34
on 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
world 0 355 34
stage, 0 355 34
but 0 355 34
also 0 355 34
to 0 355 34
‘prepare 0 355 34
the 0 355 34
terrain’ 0 355 34
for 0 355 34
the 1 355 34
former 1 355 34

to 0 355 34
be 0 355 34
prosecuted” 0 355 34
under 0 355 34
canon 0 355 34
law. 0 355 34

The 1 355 35
Dictator 1 355 35
Pope 1 355 35
must 0 355 35
destroy 0 355 35
his 0 355 35
most 0 355 35
potent 0 355 35
critic 0 355 35
thus 0 355 35
far. 0 355 35

Everything 1 355 36
depends 1 355 36
on 1 355 36
it! 1 355 36

But 0 355 37
it 0 355 37
may 0 355 37
already 0 355 37
be 0 355 37
too 0 355 37
late 0 355 37
to 0 355 37
save 0 355 37
a 0 355 37
regime 0 355 37
whose 0 355 37
only 0 355 37
defense 0 355 37
is 0 355 37
not 0 355 37
truth 0 355 37
but 0 355 37
raw 0 355 37
power. 0 355 37

At 0 355 38
last 0 355 38
count, 0 355 38
some 0 355 38
29 0 355 38
bishops 0 355 38
have 0 355 38
publicly 0 355 38
declared 0 355 38
Viganò’s 0 355 38
allegations 0 355 38
against 0 355 38
Bergoglio 0 355 38
credible 0 355 38
and 0 355 38
worthy 0 355 38
of 0 355 38
investigation. 0 355 38

Now 0 355 39
even 0 355 39
the 0 355 39
distinguished 0 355 39
canonist 0 355 39
Edward 0 355 39
Peters, 0 355 39
who 0 355 39
is 0 355 39
no 0 355 39
less 0 355 39
than 0 355 39
a 0 355 39
Referendary 0 355 39
of 0 355 39
the 0 355 39
Apostolic 0 355 39
Signatura 0 355 39
appointed 0 355 39
by 0 355 39
Pope 0 355 39
Benedict 0 355 39
XVI, 0 355 39
declares 0 355 39
that 0 355 39
if 0 355 39
Viganò’s 0 355 39
allegations 0 355 39
are 0 355 39
true 0 355 39
then 0 355 39
Bergoglio 0 355 39
must 0 355 39
go: 0 355 39

Of 0 355 40
what 0 355 40
was 0 355 40
said 0 355 40
above 0 355 40
concerning 0 355 40
resignation 0 355 40
from 0 355 40
Church 0 355 40
office 0 355 40
in 0 355 40

what 0 355 40
would 0 355 40
not 0 355 40
apply 0 355 40
to 0 355 40
a 0 355 40
pope, 0 355 40
of 0 355 40
all 0 355 40
office 0 355 40
holders, 0 355 40
if 0 355 40
he, 0 355 40
as 0 355 40
alleged 0 355 40
by 0 355 40
Viganò, 0 355 40
from 0 355 40
the 0 355 40
first 0 355 40
months 0 355 40
of 0 355 40
his 0 355 40
papacy 0 355 40
knowingly 0 355 40
protected 0 355 40
and 0 355 40
favored 0 355 40
a 0 355 40
cardinal 0 355 40
who 0 355 40
was 0 355 40
[pick 0 355 40
a 0 355 40
disgusting 0 355 40
verb]-ing 0 355 40
seminarians? 0 355 40

By 1 355 41
what 1 355 41
possible 1 355 41
stretch 1 355 41
of 1 355 41
the 1 355 41
imagination 1 355 41
would 1 355 41
such 1 355 41
an 1 355 41
occupant 1 355 41
be 1 355 41
suited 1 355 41
for 1 355 41
the 1 355 41
Chair 1 355 41
of 1 355 41
Peter? 1 355 41

Does 0 355 42
the 0 355 42
historical 0 355 42
fact 0 355 42
that 0 355 42
some 0 355 42
pretty 0 355 42
bad 0 355 42
popes 0 355 42
held 0 355 42
on 0 355 42
to 0 355 42
office 0 355 42
despite 0 355 42
committing 0 355 42
various 0 355 42
offenses 0 355 42

other 0 355 42
popes 0 355 42
acting 0 355 42
badly 0 355 42
in 0 355 42
shirking 0 355 42
even 0 355 42
the 0 355 42
minimal 0 355 42
gesture 0 355 42
of 0 355 42
resigning? 0 355 42

Viganò 0 355 43
is 0 355 43
unquestionably 0 355 43
in 0 355 43
a 0 355 43
position 0 355 43
to 0 355 43
know, 0 355 43
and 0 355 43
claims 0 355 43
to 0 355 43
know, 0 355 43
whether 0 355 43
his 0 355 43
central 0 355 43
allegation 0 355 43
that 0 355 43
Francis’ 0 355 43
was 1 355 43
covering 1 355 43
for 1 355 43
McCarrick, 1 355 43
big 1 355 43
time, 1 355 43
for 0 355 43
years, 0 355 43
is 0 355 43
correct. 0 355 43

Believing, 0 355 44
as 0 355 44
he 0 355 44
does, 0 355 44
that 0 355 44
his 0 355 44
claims 0 355 44
are 0 355 44
correct, 0 355 44
Viganò, 0 355 44
in 0 355 44
calling 0 355 44
for 0 355 44
Francis’ 0 355 44
resignation, 0 355 44
has 0 355 44

near 0 355 50
Rome, 0 355 50
in 0 355 50
1046, 0 355 50
which 0 355 50
dealt 0 355 50
with 0 355 50
the 0 355 50
problem 0 355 50
of 0 355 50
three 0 355 50
rival 0 355 50
claimants 0 355 50
to 0 355 50
the 0 355 50
papacy, 0 355 50
each 0 355 50
installed 0 355 50
by 0 355 50
a 0 355 50
Roman 0 355 50
faction: 0 355 50
First, 0 355 50
the 1 355 50
execrable 1 355 50
Benedict 1 355 50
IX, 1 355 50
mentioned 0 355 50
above. 0 355 50

Second, 0 355 51
the 1 355 51
interloper 1 355 51

well-intentioned 1 355 52

dimwitted 1 355 52
Gregory 1 355 52
VI, 1 355 52
whose 0 355 52
election 0 355 52
was 0 355 52
tainted 0 355 52

a 0 355 52
seemingly 0 355 52
simoniacal 0 355 52
negotiation 0 355 52

Benedict, 0 355 52
who 0 355 52
had 0 355 52
returned 0 355 52
to 0 355 52
Rome 0 355 52
in 0 355 52
1045 0 355 52
and 0 355 52
ousted 0 355 52
Sylvester, 0 355 52
according 0 355 52
to 0 355 52
which 0 355 52
Benedict 0 355 52
would 0 355 52
receive 0 355 52
a 0 355 52
generous 0 355 52
pension 0 355 52
if 0 355 52
he 0 355 52
resigned 0 355 52

austere 1 355 53

had 0 355 54

As 0 355 55
for 0 355 55
Sylvester, 0 355 55
the 0 355 55
Synod 0 355 55
declared 0 355 55
that 0 355 55
he 0 355 55
be 0 355 55
“stripped 1 355 55
of 1 355 55

sacerdotal 1 355 55
rank 1 355 55
and 1 355 55
shut 1 355 55
up 1 355 55
in 1 355 55
a 1 355 55
monastery.” 1 355 55
Gregory 0 355 55
was 0 355 55
also 0 355 55
declared 0 355 55
deposed, 0 355 55
either 0 355 55
by 0 355 55

act 0 355 55

he 0 355 56
died 0 355 56

only 0 355 56
a 0 355 56
year, 0 355 56

mere 0 355 57
three 0 355 57
weeks 0 355 57

succeeded 0 355 57

reigning 0 355 57
until 0 355 57

Leo, 0 355 58
as 0 355 58
John 0 355 58

which 0 355 58
included 0 355 58
a 0 355 58

“the 0 355 60

as 0 355 63
a 0 355 63
true 0 355 63

Moreover, 0 355 64
Benedict 0 355 64

himself 0 355 64
is 0 355 64

the 0 355 64
canon 0 355 64
of 0 355 64
Popes. 0 355 64

This 0 355 65
was 0 355 65
possible 0 355 65
owing 0 355 65
to 0 355 65
the 0 355 65

set 0 355 65

for 0 355 65
papal 0 355 65

a 0 355 65
Pope 0 355 65
could 0 355 65
gain 0 355 65
or 0 355 65
regain 0 355 65
the 0 355 65

even 0 355 66
the 0 355 66
Vatican’s 0 355 66
own 0 355 66
website 0 355 66
states 0 355 66
that 0 355 66
Benedict 0 355 66
was 0 355 66
Pope 0 355 66
from 0 355 66
1047-1048, 0 355 66
the 0 355 66

since.” 0 355 68
(Eric 0 355 68
John, 0 355 68
The 0 355 68
Popes, 0 355 68
181). 0 355 68

These 0 355 69
lessons 0 355 69
of 0 355 69
history 0 355 69
should 0 355 69
suffice 0 355 69
to 1 355 69
dispel 1 355 69
the 1 355 69
pious 1 355 69
fable, 1 355 69
never 0 355 69
a 0 355 69
teaching 0 355 69
of 0 355 69
the 0 355 69
Magisterium, 0 355 69
that 0 355 69
every 0 355 69
Pope 0 355 69
is 0 355 69
chosen 0 355 69
by 0 355 69
the 0 355 69
Holy 0 355 69
Ghost 0 355 69
to 0 355 69
lead 0 355 69
the 0 355 69
Church. 0 355 69

This 0 355 70
theological 0 355 70
error, 0 355 70
which 0 355 70
Bergoglio 0 355 70
has 1 355 70
exploited 1 355 70
to 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
hilt, 1 355 70
is 0 355 70
a 0 355 70
key 0 355 70
element 0 355 70
in 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
related 0 355 70
error 0 355 70
of 0 355 70
papalotry, 0 355 70
which 0 355 70
elevates 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
person 0 355 70
of 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
Pope 0 355 70
above 0 355 70
the 0 355 70
office 0 355 70
he 0 355 70
occupies 0 355 70
and 0 355 70
makes 0 355 70
of 0 355 70
him 0 355 70
the 1 355 70
leader 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
a 1 355 70
personality 1 355 70
cult 1 355 70
everyone 1 355 70
is 1 355 70
commanded 1 355 70
to 1 355 70
“love” 1 355 70
(in 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
superficially 1 355 70
emotional 1 355 70
sense) 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
obey 1 355 70
no 1 355 70
matter 1 355 70
what 1 355 70
he 1 355 70
says 1 355 70
or 1 355 70
does, 1 355 70
rather 0 355 70
than 0 355 70
a 1 355 70
custodian 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
defender 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
Deposit 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
Faith 1 355 70
whose 1 355 70
lovability, 1 355 70
personality 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
opinions 1 355 70
are 1 355 70
utterly 1 355 70
irrelevant 1 355 70
to 1 355 70
the 1 355 70
exercise 1 355 70
and 1 355 70
scope 1 355 70
of 1 355 70
his 1 355 70
office. 1 355 70

As 0 355 71
Pope 0 355 71
Benedict 0 355 71
has 0 355 71
observed, 0 355 71
when 0 355 71
it 0 355 71
comes 0 355 71
to 0 355 71
the 0 355 71
election 0 355 71
of 0 355 71
a 0 355 71
Pope 0 355 71
“the 0 355 71
Spirit’s 0 355 71
role 0 355 71
should 0 355 71
be 0 355 71
understood 0 355 71
in 0 355 71
a 0 355 71
much 0 355 71
more 0 355 71
elastic 0 355 71
sense, 0 355 71
not 0 355 71
that 0 355 71
he 0 355 71
[sic] 0 355 71
dictates 0 355 71
the 0 355 71
candidate 0 355 71
for 0 355 71
whom 0 355 71
one 0 355 71
must 0 355 71
vote…. 0 355 71

There 1 355 72
are 1 355 72
too 1 355 72
many 1 355 72
contrary 1 355 72
instances 1 355 72
of 1 355 72
popes 1 355 72
the 1 355 72
Holy 1 355 72
Spirit 1 355 72
obviously 1 355 72
would 1 355 72
not 1 355 72
have 1 355 72
picked!” 1 355 72
Bergoglio 1 355 72
is 1 355 72
undeniably 1 355 72
one 1 355 72
of 1 355 72
them. 1 355 72

So 0 355 73
what 0 355 73
can 0 355 73
be 0 355 73
done 0 355 73
to 0 355 73
defend 0 355 73
the 0 355 73
Church 0 355 73
against 0 355 73
Bergoglio? 0 355 73

That 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
mode 0 355 74
of 0 355 74
papal 0 355 74
election 0 355 74
by 0 355 74
cardinals 0 355 74
has 0 355 74
persisted 0 355 74
for 0 355 74
nearly 0 355 74
a 0 355 74
thousand 0 355 74
years 0 355 74
has 0 355 74
led 0 355 74
to 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
general 0 355 74
impression 0 355 74
that 0 355 74
it 0 355 74
pertains 0 355 74
to 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
irreformable 0 355 74
divine 0 355 74
constitution 0 355 74
of 0 355 74
the 0 355 74
Church, 0 355 74
but 0 355 74
it 0 355 74
certainly 0 355 74
does 0 355 74
not. 0 355 74

As 0 355 75
to 0 355 75
matters 0 355 75
of 0 355 75
purely 0 355 75
ecclesiastical 0 355 75
law 0 355 75
such 0 355 75
as 0 355 75
this 0 355 75
one 0 355 75
the 0 355 75
Church 0 355 75
has 0 355 75
always 0 355 75
allowed 0 355 75
for 0 355 75
departures 0 355 75
from 0 355 75
traditional 0 355 75
practice 0 355 75
in 0 355 75
cases 0 355 75
of 0 355 75
emergency 0 355 75
or 0 355 75
grave 0 355 75
necessity. 0 355 75

And 0 355 76
just 0 355 76
as 0 355 76
a 0 355 76
synod 0 355 76
was 0 355 76
employed 0 355 76
to 0 355 76
address 0 355 76
three 0 355 76
rival 0 355 76
claimants 0 355 76
to 0 355 76
the 0 355 76
papal 0 355 76
throne 0 355 76
in 0 355 76
1046, 0 355 76
declaring 0 355 76
at 0 355 76
least 0 355 76
two 0 355 76
of 0 355 76
them 0 355 76
deposed, 0 355 76
so 0 355 76
today 0 355 76
might 0 355 76
it 0 355 76
be 0 355 76
possible 0 355 76
for 0 355 76
reform-minded 0 355 76
cardinals 0 355 76
and 0 355 76
bishops, 0 355 76
comprising 0 355 76
an 0 355 76
imperfect 0 355 76
council, 0 355 76
to 0 355 76
undo 0 355 76
the 1 355 76
incalculable 1 355 76
damage 1 355 76
caused 0 355 76
by 0 355 76
the 0 355 76
cabal 0 355 76
that 0 355 76
lobbied 0 355 76
for 0 355 76
Bergoglio’s 0 355 76
election 0 355 76
before 0 355 76
the 0 355 76
last 0 355 76
conclave—a 0 355 76
cabal 0 355 76
that 0 355 76
included 0 355 76
none 0 355 76
other 0 355 76
than 0 355 76
McCarrick, 0 355 76
whom 0 355 76
Bergoglio 0 355 76
rewarded 0 355 76
by 0 355 76
rehabilitating 0 355 76
that 1 355 76
monster 1 355 76
despite 0 355 76
the 1 355 76
massive 1 355 76
evidence 1 355 76
of 1 355 76
his 1 355 76
unspeakable 1 355 76
crimes. 1 355 76

What 0 355 77
would 0 355 77
be 0 355 77
the 0 355 77
grounds 0 355 77
for 0 355 77
a 0 355 77
declaration 0 355 77
of 0 355 77
deposition 0 355 77
at 0 355 77
such 0 355 77
a 0 355 77
gathering 0 355 77
of 0 355 77
prelates? 0 355 77

One 0 355 78
could 0 355 78
readily 0 355 78
point 0 355 78
to 0 355 78
the 0 355 78
evidence 0 355 78
that 0 355 78
a 0 355 78
faction 0 355 78
that 0 355 78
included 0 355 78
Bergoglio 0 355 78
himself 0 355 78
had 0 355 78
agreed 0 355 78
upon 0 355 78
his 0 355 78
election 0 355 78
before 0 355 78
the 0 355 78
conclave, 0 355 78
and 0 355 78
that 0 355 78
all 0 355 78
those 0 355 78
involved, 0 355 78
including 0 355 78
Bergoglio, 0 355 78
were 0 355 78
thereby 0 355 78
excommunicated 0 355 78
latae 0 355 78
sententiae 0 355 78
in 1 355 78
accordance 1 355 78
with 1 355 78
Article 1 355 78
81 1 355 78
of 1 355 78
John 1 355 78
Paul 1 355 78
II’s 1 355 78
Universi 1 355 78
Dominici 1 355 78
Gregis, 1 355 78
which 1 355 78
provides: 1 355 78

The 1 355 79
Cardinal 1 355 79
electors 1 355 79
shall 1 355 79
further 1 355 79
abstain 1 355 79
from 1 355 79
any 1 355 79
form 1 355 79
of 1 355 79
pact, 1 355 79
agreement, 1 355 79
promise 1 355 79
or 1 355 79
other 1 355 79
commitment 1 355 79
of 1 355 79
any 1 355 79
kind 1 355 79
which 1 355 79
could 1 355 79
oblige 1 355 79
them 1 355 79
to 1 355 79
give 1 355 79
or 1 355 79
deny 1 355 79
their 1 355 79
vote 1 355 79
to 1 355 79
a 1 355 79
person 1 355 79
or 1 355 79
persons. 1 355 79

If 1 355 80
this 1 355 80
were 1 355 80
in 1 355 80
fact 1 355 80
done, 1 355 80
even 1 355 80
under 1 355 80
oath, 1 355 80
I 1 355 80
decree 1 355 80
that 1 355 80
such 1 355 80
a 1 355 80
commitment 1 355 80
shall 1 355 80
be 1 355 80
null 1 355 80
and 1 355 80
void 1 355 80
and 1 355 80
that 1 355 80
no 1 355 80
one 1 355 80
shall 1 355 80
be 1 355 80
bound 1 355 80
to 1 355 80
observe 1 355 80
it; 1 355 80
and 1 355 80
I 1 355 80
hereby 1 355 80
impose 1 355 80
the 1 355 80
penalty 1 355 80
of 1 355 80
excommunication 1 355 80
latae 1 355 80
sententiae 1 355 80
upon 1 355 80
those 1 355 80
who 1 355 80
violate 1 355 80
this 1 355 80
prohibition. 1 355 80

To 1 355 81

deposition 1 355 81
by 1 355 81
an 1 355 81
imperfect 1 355 81

is 1 355 81
appropriate 1 355 81
“when 1 355 81
one 1 355 81
or 1 355 81
more 1 355 81
Popes 1 355 81

to 1 355 81
their 1 355 81

as 1 355 81
seems 1 355 81
to 1 355 81
have 1 355 81
arisen 1 355 81
in 1 355 81
the 1 355 81

of 1 355 81
Urban 1 355 81
VI 1 355 81

others. 1 355 81

Then, 1 355 82
lest 1 355 82
the 1 355 82
Church 1 355 82
be 1 355 82
perplexed, 1 355 82
those 1 355 82

the 1 355 82
Church 1 355 82

the 1 355 82
power 1 355 82
to 1 355 82
judge 1 355 82
which 1 355 82
is 1 355 82
the 1 355 82
true 1 355 82
pope, 1 355 82
if 1 355 82
it 1 355 82
can 1 355 82
be 1 355 82

I 0 355 83
am 0 355 83
not 0 355 83

Rather, 0 355 84
what 0 355 84
I 0 355 84
am 0 355 84
saying 0 355 84
is 0 355 84
that 0 355 84
this 0 355 84
hypothetical 0 355 84
imperfect 0 355 84

that 0 355 84
it 0 355 84

been 0 355 84
proven 0 355 84

and 0 355 84
that 0 355 84
the 0 355 84

would 0 355 84
judge 0 355 84
any 0 355 84
resulting 0 355 84
deposition 0 355 84
of 0 355 84
Bergoglio 0 355 84

the 0 355 84

it 0 355 84
judges 0 355 84
the 0 355 84
deposition 0 355 84

Another 0 355 85

determined 0 355 85
by 0 355 85

imperfect 0 355 85
council, 0 355 85
not 0 355 85
any 0 355 85
of 0 355 85
us—would 0 355 85
be 0 355 85
that 0 355 85
Bergoglio 1 355 85
has 1 355 85
deposed 1 355 85
himself 1 355 85
by 1 355 85
promulgating 1 355 85
heresy, 1 355 85

and 1 355 85
undermining 1 355 85
the 1 355 85
teaching 1 355 85
of 1 355 85
even 1 355 85
his 1 355 85
own 1 355 85
immediate 1 355 85
predecessors 1 355 85
on 1 355 85
matters 1 355 85
of 1 355 85
fundamental 1 355 85
morality 1 355 85
upheld 1 355 85
by 1 355 85
the 1 355 85
Magisterium 1 355 85
for 1 355 85
two 1 355 85
millennia. 1 355 85

Surely 0 355 86
the 0 355 86
Church 0 355 86
cannot 0 355 86
be 0 355 86
without 0 355 86
any 0 355 86
remedy 0 355 86
for 0 355 86
a 1 355 86
Pope 1 355 86
who 1 355 86
relentlessly 1 355 86
attacks 1 355 86
her 1 355 86
very 1 355 86
foundations! 1 355 86

To 1 355 87
quote 1 355 87
Cajetan 1 355 87
again: 1 355 87
“Indeed 1 355 87
the 1 355 87
Church 1 355 87
has 1 355 87
the 1 355 87
right 1 355 87
to 1 355 87
separate 1 355 87
herself 1 355 87
from 1 355 87
an 1 355 87
heretical 1 355 87
pope 1 355 87
according 1 355 87
to 1 355 87
divine 1 355 87
law. 1 355 87

Consequently, 1 355 88
it 1 355 88
has 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
right, 1 355 88
by 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
same 1 355 88
divine 1 355 88
law, 1 355 88
to 1 355 88
use 1 355 88
all 1 355 88
means 1 355 88
of 1 355 88
themselves 1 355 88
necessary 1 355 88
for 1 355 88
such 1 355 88
separation; 1 355 88
and 1 355 88
those 1 355 88
that 1 355 88
juridically 1 355 88
correspond 1 355 88
to 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
crime, 1 355 88
are 1 355 88
of 1 355 88
themselves 1 355 88
necessary”—meaning 1 355 88
the 1 355 88
resort 1 355 88
to 1 355 88
an 1 355 88
imperfect 1 355 88
council. 1 355 88

If 0 355 89
a 0 355 89
synod 0 355 89
was 0 355 89
able 0 355 89
to 0 355 89
declare 0 355 89
the 0 355 89
deposition 0 355 89
of 0 355 89
a 0 355 89
pope 0 355 89
in 0 355 89
1046, 0 355 89
why 0 355 89
not 0 355 89
an 0 355 89
imperfect 0 355 89
council 0 355 89
today—or, 0 355 89
for 0 355 89
that 0 355 89
matter, 0 355 89
another 0 355 89
synod? 0 355 89

It 0 355 90
will 0 355 90
be 0 355 90
argued 0 355 90
that 0 355 90
such 0 355 90
a 0 355 90
deposition 0 355 90
would 0 355 90
provoke 0 355 90
massive 0 355 90
schisms 0 355 90
in 0 355 90
the 0 355 90
Church. 0 355 90

But 0 355 91
that 0 355 91
would 0 355 91
not 0 355 91
be 0 355 91
the 0 355 91
first 0 355 91
time 0 355 91
that 0 355 91
defense 0 355 91
of 0 355 91
the 0 355 91
Church’s 0 355 91
common 0 355 91
good 0 355 91
has 0 355 91
done 0 355 91
so, 0 355 91
as 0 355 91
the 0 355 91
Great 0 355 91
Western 0 355 91
Schism 0 355 91
demonstrates. 0 355 91

And 1 355 92
are 1 355 92
we 1 355 92
not 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
the 1 355 92
midst 1 355 92
of 1 355 92
schisms 1 355 92
already, 1 355 92
provoked 1 355 92
by 1 355 92
none 1 355 92
other 1 355 92
than 1 355 92
Bergoglio 1 355 92
himself, 1 355 92
whose 1 355 92
insane 1 355 92
drive 1 355 92
to 1 355 92
shatter 1 355 92
the 1 355 92
Church’s 1 355 92
bimillennial 1 355 92
discipline 1 355 92
has 1 355 92
produced 1 355 92
the 1 355 92
totally 1 355 92
unprecedented 1 355 92
situation 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
which 1 355 92
what 1 355 92
is 1 355 92
still 1 355 92
considered 1 355 92
mortally 1 355 92
sinful 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
one 1 355 92
diocese 1 355 92
is 1 355 92
an 1 355 92
imperative 1 355 92
of 1 355 92
“mercy” 1 355 92
in 1 355 92
another? 1 355 92

In 0 355 93
any 0 355 93
case, 0 355 93
this 0 355 93
much 0 355 93
is 0 355 93
certain: 0 355 93
barring 0 355 93
Bergoglio’s 0 355 93
conversion 0 355 93
and 0 355 93
reversal 0 355 93
of 0 355 93
course, 0 355 93
the 0 355 93
Church 0 355 93
cannot 0 355 93
abide 0 355 93
this 0 355 93
pontificate 0 355 93
any 0 355 93
longer. 0 355 93

One 0 355 94
way 0 355 94
or 0 355 94
another, 0 355 94
the 0 355 94
Church 0 355 94
will 0 355 94
have 0 355 94
to 0 355 94
repel 0 355 94
an 0 355 94
attacker 0 355 94
at 0 355 94
her 0 355 94
very 0 355 94
summit. 0 355 94

Either 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
human 1 355 95
element 1 355 95
of 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
Church 1 355 95
will 1 355 95
act 1 355 95
according 1 355 95
to 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
means 1 355 95
which 1 355 95
seem 1 355 95
possible, 1 355 95
however 1 355 95
extraordinary, 1 355 95
or 1 355 95
Heaven 1 355 95
itself 1 355 95
will 1 355 95
intervene 1 355 95
in 0 355 95
a 0 355 95
manner 0 355 95
that 0 355 95
might 0 355 95
well 0 355 95
involve 0 355 95
a 0 355 95
divine 0 355 95
chastisement 0 355 95
due 0 355 95
to 0 355 95
the 1 355 95
negligence 1 355 95
of 1 355 95
time-serving 1 355 95
pastors 1 355 95
who 1 355 95
left 1 355 95
their 1 355 95
sheep 1 355 95
completely 1 355 95
undefended 1 355 95
against 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
wolves 1 355 95
who 1 355 95
preyed 1 355 95
upon 1 355 95
them, 1 355 95
including 0 355 95
the 1 355 95
wolf 1 355 95
the 1 355 95
cardinals 1 355 95
improvidently 1 355 95
elected 1 355 95
Pope. 1 355 95

Some 0 355 96

territory 0 355 96
in 0 355 96
the 0 355 96

that 0 355 96
Bergoglio’s 0 355 96

intercommunion 0 355 96
with 0 355 96

that 0 355 96

the 0 355 96
truth. 0 355 96

What 0 355 97
can 0 355 97
the 0 355 97
Church 0 355 97
do 0 355 97
when 0 355 97
confronted 0 355 97
by 0 355 97
a 1 355 97
Pope 1 355 97
who, 1 355 97
as 1 355 97
a 1 355 97
prominent 1 355 97
cardinal 1 355 97
declares 1 355 97
to 1 355 97
the 1 355 97
whole 1 355 97
world, 1 355 97
“fail[s] 1 355 97

It 1 355 98
seems 1 355 98

papal 1 355 98
malefactor, 1 355 98

as 1 355 98
if 1 355 98

wreaking 1 355 98
havoc 1 355 98
upon 1 355 98
faith 1 355 98

morals 1 355 98
to 1 355 98
the 1 355 98
detriment 1 355 98
of 1 355 98

for 0 355 98

long 0 355 98

No, 0 355 99
