his 0 3 1
500 0 3 1
plus-page 0 3 1
report, 0 3 1
which 0 3 1
purports 0 3 1
to 0 3 1
shine 0 3 1
a 0 3 1
light 0 3 1
on 0 3 1
the 0 3 1
mishandling 0 3 1
at 0 3 1
top 0 3 1
levels 0 3 1
of 0 3 1
the 0 3 1

The 0 3 3

from 0 3 3
the 0 3 3

Justice’s 0 3 3
Office 0 3 3
of 0 3 3
the 0 3 3
Inspector 0 3 3
General 0 3 3
(“OIG”) 0 3 3
criticized 0 3 3
certain 0 3 3
actions 0 3 3
and 0 3 3
decisions 0 3 3
of 0 3 3
former 0 3 3
FBI 0 3 3
Director 0 3 3
James 0 3 3
Comey, 0 3 3
together 0 3 3
with 0 3 3
those 0 3 3
of 0 3 3
other 0 3 3
senior 0 3 3
FBI 0 3 3
officials 0 3 3
who 0 3 3
were 0 3 3
involved 0 3 3
in 0 3 3
the 0 3 3

including 0 3 3
former 0 3 3
Deputy 0 3 3
FBI 0 3 3
Director 0 3 3
Andrew 0 3 3
McCabe. 0 3 3

Mr. 0 3 4
McCabe 0 3 4
is 0 3 4
already 0 3 4
the 0 3 4

of 0 3 4

referral 0 3 4
from 0 3 4

his 0 3 4
alleged 0 3 4
unauthorized 0 3 4

who 0 3 5
has 0 3 5
since 0 3 5
left 0 3 5
the 0 3 5
FBI, 0 3 5
were 0 3 5
targeted 0 3 5
in 0 3 5
this 0 3 5
report 0 3 5
for 0 3 5
their 0 3 5
blatantly 1 3 5
anti-Trump 1 3 5
text 0 3 5
messages. 0 3 5

Former 0 3 6
Attorney 0 3 6
General 0 3 6
Loretta 0 3 6
Lynch 0 3 6
was 0 3 6
also 0 3 6
criticized 0 3 6
for 0 3 6
exercising 0 3 6
bad 0 3 6
judgment 0 3 6
in 0 3 6
connection 0 3 6
with 0 3 6
her 0 3 6
infamous 1 3 6
tarmac 0 3 6
meeting 0 3 6
with 0 3 6
Bill 0 3 6
Clinton. 0 3 6

Mr. 0 3 7
Horowitz’s 0 3 7
report 0 3 7
focused 0 3 7
on 0 3 7
process 0 3 7
and 0 3 7
procedures. 0 3 7

The 0 3 8
inspector 0 3 8
general 0 3 8
made 0 3 8
clear 0 3 8
when 0 3 8
he 0 3 8
launched 0 3 8
his 0 3 8
investigation 0 3 8
in 0 3 8
January 0 3 8
2017 0 3 8
that 0 3 8
“his 0 3 8
review 0 3 8
will 0 3 8
not 0 3 8
substitute 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
OIG's 0 3 8
judgment 0 3 8
for 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
judgments 0 3 8
made 0 3 8
by 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
FBI 0 3 8
or 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
Department 0 3 8
regarding 0 3 8
the 0 3 8
substantive 0 3 8
merits 0 3 8
of 0 3 8
investigative 0 3 8
or 0 3 8
prosecutive 0 3 8
decisions." 0 3 8

Moreover, 0 3 9
this 0 3 9
report 0 3 9
did 0 3 9
not 0 3 9
address 0 3 9
whether 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
Department 0 3 9
of 0 3 9
Justice 0 3 9
or 0 3 9
FBI 0 3 9
abused 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
Foreign 0 3 9
Intelligence 0 3 9
Surveillance 0 3 9
Act 0 3 9
to 0 3 9
obtain 0 3 9
a 0 3 9
surveillance 0 3 9
order 0 3 9
against 0 3 9
former 0 3 9
Trump 0 3 9
campaign 0 3 9
advisor 0 3 9
Carter 0 3 9
Page, 0 3 9
or 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
government’s 0 3 9
reliance 0 3 9
on 0 3 9
former 0 3 9
British 0 3 9
intelligence 0 3 9
agent 0 3 9
Christopher 0 3 9
Steele’s 0 3 9
salacious 1 3 9
and 0 3 9
unverified 0 3 9
“dossier” 0 3 9
in 0 3 9
its 0 3 9
FISA 0 3 9
court 0 3 9
application, 0 3 9
which 0 3 9
the 0 3 9
OIG 0 3 9
is 0 3 9
investigating 0 3 9
separately. 0 3 9

In 0 3 10
analyzing 0 3 10
the 0 3 10
highly 0 3 10
anticipated 0 3 10
OIG 0 3 10
report’s 0 3 10
conclusions, 0 3 10
it 0 3 10
is 0 3 10
clear 0 3 10
that 0 3 10
either 0 3 10
Mr. 0 3 10
Horowitz 0 3 10
himself 0 3 10
decided 0 3 10
to 0 3 10
pull 0 3 10
his 0 3 10
punches 0 3 10
or 0 3 10
that 0 3 10
the 0 3 10
final 0 3 10
version, 0 3 10
which 0 3 10
had 0 3 10
been 0 3 10
reviewed 0 3 10
by 0 3 10
upper 0 3 10
echelons 0 3 10
in 0 3 10
both 0 3 10
the 0 3 10
FBI 0 3 10
and 0 3 10
Justice 0 3 10
Department 0 3 10
before 0 3 10
its 0 3 10
public 0 3 10
release, 0 3 10
emerged 1 3 10
in 1 3 10
a 1 3 10
disappointingly 1 3 10
watered-down 1 3 10
form. 1 3 10

To 0 3 11
be 0 3 11
sure, 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
report 0 3 11
faulted 0 3 11
Comey 0 3 11
for 0 3 11
deviating 0 3 11
from 0 3 11
FBI 0 3 11
and 0 3 11
Justice 0 3 11
Department 0 3 11
procedures 0 3 11
in 0 3 11
handling 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
probe 0 3 11
into 0 3 11
Hillary 0 3 11
Clinton’s 0 3 11
use 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
a 0 3 11
private 0 3 11
e-mail 0 3 11
server 0 3 11
while 0 3 11
she 0 3 11
served 0 3 11
as 0 3 11
Secretary 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
State, 0 3 11
thereby 0 3 11
negatively 0 3 11
impacting 0 3 11
“the 0 3 11
perception 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
FBI 0 3 11
and 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
department 0 3 11
as 0 3 11
fair 0 3 11
administrators 0 3 11
of 0 3 11
justice.” 0 3 11
Comey, 0 3 11
according 0 3 11
to 0 3 11
the 0 3 11
OIG 0 3 11
report, 0 3 11
“engaged 0 3 11
in 0 3 11
ad 0 3 11
hoc 0 3 11
decision 0 3 11
making 0 3 11
based 0 3 11
on 0 3 11
his 0 3 11
personal 0 3 11
views 0 3 11
even 0 3 11
if 0 3 11
it 0 3 11
meant 0 3 11
rejecting 0 3 11
longstanding 0 3 11
Department 0 3 11
policy 0 3 11
or 0 3 11
practice.” 0 3 11

Starting 0 3 12
with 0 3 12
Comey’s 0 3 12
public 0 3 12
announcement 0 3 12
on 0 3 12
July 0 3 12
5, 0 3 12
2016 0 3 12
criticizing 0 3 12
Hillary 0 3 12
Clinton 0 3 12
and 0 3 12
her 0 3 12
staff 0 3 12
for 0 3 12
being 0 3 12
“extremely 1 3 12
careless 1 3 12
in 0 3 12
their 0 3 12
handling 0 3 12
of 0 3 12
very 0 3 12
sensitive, 0 3 12
highly 0 3 12
classified 0 3 12
information,” 0 3 12
but 0 3 12
also 0 3 12
announcing 0 3 12
that 0 3 12
the 0 3 12
FBI 0 3 12
was 0 3 12
“expressing 0 3 12
to 0 3 12
Justice 0 3 12
our 0 3 12
view 0 3 12
that 0 3 12
no 0 3 12
charges 0 3 12
are 0 3 12
appropriate 0 3 12
in 0 3 12
this 0 3 12
case,” 0 3 12
Comey 0 3 12
was 0 3 12
taken 0 3 12
to 0 3 12
task 0 3 12
for 0 3 12
insubordination 0 3 12
and 0 3 12
usurping 0 3 12
the 0 3 12
authority 0 3 12
of 0 3 12
the 0 3 12
attorney 0 3 12
general. 0 3 12

He 0 3 13
“upset 0 3 13
the 0 3 13
well-established 0 3 13
separation 0 3 13
between 0 3 13
investigative 0 3 13
and 0 3 13
prosecutorial 0 3 13
functions,” 0 3 13
the 0 3 13
report 0 3 13
said. 0 3 13

Comey’s 0 3 14
follow-up 0 3 14
letters 0 3 14
to 0 3 14
Congress 0 3 14
on 0 3 14
October 0 3 14
28 0 3 14
and 0 3 14
November 0 3 14
6, 0 3 14
2016 0 3 14
were 0 3 14
similarly 0 3 14
criticized. 0 3 14

The 0 3 15
first 0 3 15
letter 0 3 15
informed 0 3 15
Congress 0 3 15
that 0 3 15
agents 0 3 15
were 0 3 15
reopening 0 3 15
their 0 3 15
probe 0 3 15
into 0 3 15
Clinton’s 0 3 15
handling 0 3 15
of 0 3 15
classified 0 3 15
material 0 3 15
after 0 3 15
discovering 0 3 15
her 0 3 15
e-mails 0 3 15
on 0 3 15
the 0 3 15
laptop 0 3 15
of 0 3 15
Andrew 0 3 15
Weiner, 0 3 15
the 0 3 15
husband 0 3 15
of 0 3 15
Clinton’s 0 3 15
top 0 3 15
aide 0 3 15
Huma 0 3 15
Abedin. 0 3 15

This 0 3 16
letter 0 3 16
was 0 3 16
followed 0 3 16
on 0 3 16
November 0 3 16
6, 0 3 16
2016 0 3 16
by 0 3 16
Comey’s 0 3 16
statement 0 3 16
that 0 3 16
the 0 3 16
review 0 3 16
of 0 3 16
the 0 3 16
additional 0 3 16
information 0 3 16
had 0 3 16
been 0 3 16
completed 0 3 16
and 0 3 16
that 0 3 16
the 0 3 16
FBI 0 3 16
remained 0 3 16
convinced 0 3 16
that 0 3 16
charges 0 3 16
were 0 3 16
not 0 3 16
appropriate. 0 3 16

Comey 0 3 17
acted 0 3 17
against 0 3 17
the 0 3 17
advice 0 3 17
of 0 3 17
senior 0 3 17
Justice 0 3 17
Department 0 3 17
officials 0 3 17
in 0 3 17
making 0 3 17
these 0 3 17
disclosures 0 3 17
the 0 3 17
way 0 3 17
he 0 3 17
did. 0 3 17

The 0 3 18
OIG 0 3 18
report 0 3 18
was 0 3 18
highly 0 3 18
critical 0 3 18
of 0 3 18
the 0 3 18
FBI’s 0 3 18
failure 0 3 18
to 0 3 18
take 0 3 18
immediate 0 3 18
action 0 3 18
on 0 3 18
the 0 3 18
Weiner 0 3 18
laptop 0 3 18
when 0 3 18
they 0 3 18
first 0 3 18
learned 0 3 18
about 0 3 18
it 0 3 18
in 0 3 18
late 0 3 18
September 0 3 18
2016, 0 3 18
rather 0 3 18
than 0 3 18
waiting 0 3 18
another 0 3 18
month 0 3 18
so 0 3 18
close 0 3 18
to 0 3 18
the 0 3 18
election. 0 3 18

The 0 3 19
criticisms 0 3 19
of 0 3 19
Comey's 0 3 19
undisciplined 0 3 19
behavior 0 3 19
was 0 3 19
all 0 3 19
well 0 3 19
and 0 3 19
good, 0 3 19
but 0 3 19
it 0 3 19
was 0 3 19
reasonable 0 3 19
to 0 3 19
expect 0 3 19
something 0 3 19
more 0 3 19
than 0 3 19
the 0 3 19
equivalent 0 3 19
of 0 3 19
a 0 3 19
departmental 0 3 19
employee 0 3 19
review 0 3 19
after 0 3 19
nearly 0 3 19
a 0 3 19
year 0 3 19
and 0 3 19
a 0 3 19
half 0 3 19
of 0 3 19
investigation. 0 3 19

Hillary 0 3 20
Clinton’s 0 3 20
supporters 0 3 20
will 0 3 20
no 0 3 20
doubt 0 3 20
jump 0 3 20
on 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
inspector 0 3 20
general’s 0 3 20
criticisms 0 3 20
of 0 3 20
Comey’s 0 3 20
handling 0 3 20
of 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
July 0 3 20
5th 0 3 20
announcement 0 3 20
and 0 3 20
subsequent 0 3 20
letters 0 3 20
as 0 3 20
proof 0 3 20
that 0 3 20
he 0 3 20
improperly 0 3 20
influenced 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
outcome 0 3 20
of 0 3 20
the 0 3 20
election 0 3 20
in 0 3 20
President 0 3 20
Trump’s 0 3 20
favor, 0 3 20
even 0 3 20
if 0 3 20
he 0 3 20
did 0 3 20
not 0 3 20
do 0 3 20
so 0 3 20
deliberately 0 3 20
for 0 3 20
political 0 3 20
reasons. 0 3 20

However, 0 3 21
what 0 3 21
Comey 0 3 21
really 0 3 21
did 0 3 21
was 0 3 21
to 0 3 21
give 1 3 21
Hillary 1 3 21
Clinton 1 3 21
a 1 3 21
Get 1 3 21
Out 1 3 21
of 1 3 21
Jail 1 3 21
Free 1 3 21
card. 1 3 21

The 0 3 22
fix 0 3 22
was 0 3 22
in 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
early 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
May 0 3 22
2016, 0 3 22
well 0 3 22
before 0 3 22
the 0 3 22
FBI 0 3 22
interviews 0 3 22
of 0 3 22
Hillary 0 3 22
Clinton 0 3 22
and 0 3 22
of 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
many 0 3 22
as 0 3 22
17 0 3 22
other 0 3 22
key 0 3 22
witnesses, 0 3 22
when 0 3 22
Comey 0 3 22
began 0 3 22
the 0 3 22
process 0 3 22
of 0 3 22
drafting 0 3 22
an 0 3 22
exoneration 0 3 22
memo. 0 3 22

Comey’s 0 3 23
initial 0 3 23
draft 0 3 23
statement, 0 3 23
which 0 3 23
he 0 3 23
shared 0 3 23
with 0 3 23
FBI 0 3 23
senior 0 3 23
leadership 0 3 23
on 0 3 23
May 0 3 23
2, 0 3 23
criticized 0 3 23
Clinton’s 0 3 23
handling 0 3 23
of 0 3 23
classified 0 3 23
information 0 3 23
as 0 3 23
“grossly 1 3 23
negligent,” 1 3 23
but 0 3 23
concluded 0 3 23
that 0 3 23
“no 0 3 23
reasonable 0 3 23
prosecutor” 0 3 23
would 0 3 23
bring 0 3 23
a 0 3 23
case 0 3 23
based 0 3 23
on 0 3 23
the 0 3 23
facts 0 3 23
developed 0 3 23
in 0 3 23
the 0 3 23
investigation. 0 3 23

Indeed, 0 3 24
Comey 0 3 24
admitted 0 3 24
in 0 3 24
his 0 3 24
book 0 3 24
that 0 3 24
“we 0 3 24
started 0 3 24
the 0 3 24
Clinton 0 3 24
investigation 0 3 24
aware 0 3 24
that 0 3 24
it 0 3 24
was 0 3 24
unlikely 0 3 24
to 0 3 24
be 0 3 24
a 0 3 24
case 0 3 24
that 0 3 24
career 0 3 24
prosecutors 0 3 24
at 0 3 24
the 0 3 24
Department 0 3 24
of 0 3 24
Justice 0 3 24
would 0 3 24
prosecute.” 0 3 24

If 0 3 25
putting 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
cart 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
exoneration 0 3 25
before 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
horse 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
investigation 0 3 25
were 0 3 25
not 0 3 25
enough, 0 3 25
Comey’s 0 3 25
draft 0 3 25
statement 0 3 25
underwent 0 3 25
various 0 3 25
language 0 3 25
changes 0 3 25
over 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
course 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
next 0 3 25
two 0 3 25
months, 0 3 25
including, 0 3 25
most 0 3 25
importantly, 0 3 25
changing 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
description 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
Clinton’s 0 3 25
handling 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
classified 0 3 25
information 0 3 25
from 0 3 25
“grossly 1 3 25
negligent” 1 3 25
to 0 3 25
“extremely 1 3 25
careless.” 1 3 25
This 0 3 25
change 0 3 25
was 0 3 25
critical 0 3 25
because 0 3 25
“gross 1 3 25
negligence” 1 3 25
is 0 3 25
specifically 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
legal 0 3 25
term 0 3 25
used 0 3 25
in 0 3 25
stating 0 3 25
the 0 3 25
statutory 0 3 25
requirement 0 3 25
in 0 3 25
18 0 3 25
U.S. 0 3 25
Code 0 3 25
§ 0 3 25
793(f) 0 3 25
for 0 3 25
a 0 3 25
finding 0 3 25
of 0 3 25
criminal 0 3 25
conduct. 0 3 25

Comey’s 0 3 26
substitution 0 3 26
of 0 3 26
a 0 3 26
legally 0 3 26
meaningless 0 3 26
phrase, 0 3 26
“extremely 1 3 26
careless,” 1 3 26
for 0 3 26
the 0 3 26
“gross 1 3 26
negligence” 1 3 26
statutory 0 3 26
legal 0 3 26
standard 0 3 26
he 0 3 26
had 0 3 26
originally 0 3 26
used, 0 3 26
had 0 3 26
the 0 3 26
effect 0 3 26
of 0 3 26
prejudging 0 3 26
the 0 3 26
facts 0 3 26
in 0 3 26
Hillary 0 3 26
Clinton’s 0 3 26
favor. 0 3 26

Andrew 0 3 27
McCabe, 0 3 27
Peter 0 3 27
Strzok 0 3 27
and 0 3 27
Lisa 0 3 27
Page 0 3 27
were 0 3 27
involved 0 3 27
in 0 3 27
the 0 3 27
edits. 0 3 27

Inspector 0 3 28
General 0 3 28
Horowitz 0 3 28
saw 0 3 28
no 0 3 28
problem 0 3 28
with 0 3 28
this 0 3 28
pattern 0 3 28
of 0 3 28
obfuscation 0 3 28
regarding 0 3 28
the 0 3 28
deletion 0 3 28
of 0 3 28
the 0 3 28
legally 0 3 28
significant 0 3 28
phrase 0 3 28
“gross 1 3 28
negligence” 1 3 28
from 0 3 28
Comey’s 0 3 28
statement. 0 3 28

Mr. 0 3 29
Horowitz 0 3 29
relied 0 3 29
in 0 3 29
part 0 3 29
on 0 3 29
opinions 0 3 29
from 0 3 29
prosecutors 0 3 29
that 0 3 29
there 0 3 29
was 0 3 29
not 0 3 29
enough 0 3 29
evidence 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
charge 0 3 29
Clinton 0 3 29
with 0 3 29
acting 0 3 29
in 0 3 29
a 0 3 29
manner 0 3 29
that 0 3 29
rose 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
a 0 3 29
level 0 3 29
of 0 3 29
criminal 0 3 29
gross 1 3 29
negligence 1 3 29
with 0 3 29
respect 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
sending 0 3 29
or 0 3 29
receiving 0 3 29
e-mails 0 3 29
determined 0 3 29
to 0 3 29
contain 0 3 29
classified 0 3 29
information. 0 3 29

Mr. 0 3 30
Horowitz’s 0 3 30
report 0 3 30
thus 0 3 30
concluded, 0 3 30
“We 0 3 30
did 0 3 30
not 0 3 30
identify 0 3 30
evidence 0 3 30
of 0 3 30
bias 0 3 30
or 0 3 30
improper 0 3 30
considerations.” 0 3 30
This 0 3 30
conclusion 0 3 30
defies 0 3 30
common 0 3 30
sense. 0 3 30

Gross 1 3 31
negligence 1 3 31
is 0 3 31
not 0 3 31
the 0 3 31
same 0 3 31
as 0 3 31
willful 0 3 31
intent, 0 3 31
which 0 3 31
Comey 0 3 31
and 0 3 31
his 0 3 31
team 0 3 31
sought 0 3 31
to 0 3 31
conflate 0 3 31
in 0 3 31
exonerating 0 3 31
Hillary 0 3 31
Clinton 0 3 31
before 0 3 31
the 0 3 31
investigation 0 3 31
was 0 3 31
concluded. 0 3 31

Clinton 0 3 32
was 0 3 32
fully 0 3 32
aware 0 3 32
of 0 3 32
what 0 3 32
she 0 3 32
was 0 3 32
doing 0 3 32
when 0 3 32
she 0 3 32
set 0 3 32
up 0 3 32
the 0 3 32
private 0 3 32
server 0 3 32
arrangement 0 3 32
in 0 3 32
the 0 3 32
first 0 3 32
place 0 3 32
and 0 3 32
knowingly 0 3 32
used 0 3 32
it 0 3 32
to 0 3 32
send 0 3 32
and 0 3 32
receive 0 3 32
e-mails 0 3 32
involving 0 3 32
official 0 3 32
government 0 3 32
business, 0 3 32
which 0 3 32
by 0 3 32
their 0 3 32
very 0 3 32
nature 0 3 32
would 0 3 32
be 0 3 32
expected 0 3 32
to 0 3 32
include 0 3 32
classified 0 3 32
information. 0 3 32

It 0 3 33
turns 0 3 33
out 0 3 33
that 0 3 33
some 0 3 33
of 0 3 33
the 0 3 33
e-mails 0 3 33
were 0 3 33
accessed 0 3 33
by 0 3 33
foreign 0 3 33
parties. 0 3 33

Hillary 0 3 34
lied 0 3 34
repeatedly 0 3 34
when 0 3 34
she 0 3 34
first 0 3 34
denied 0 3 34
there 0 3 34
were 0 3 34
any 0 3 34
classified 0 3 34
e-mails 0 3 34
on 0 3 34
her 0 3 34
system 0 3 34
and 0 3 34
then 0 3 34
described 0 3 34
some 0 3 34
of 0 3 34
the 0 3 34
e-mails 0 3 34
involved 0 3 34
in 0 3 34
the 0 3 34
investigation 0 3 34
as 0 3 34
having 0 3 34
been 0 3 34
classified 0 3 34
after 0 3 34
the 0 3 34
fact. 0 3 34

As 0 3 35
Comey 0 3 35
has 0 3 35
admitted, 0 3 35
several 0 3 35
e-mail 0 3 35
chains 0 3 35
concerned 0 3 35
matters 0 3 35
that 0 3 35
were 0 3 35
classified 0 3 35
at 0 3 35
the 0 3 35
Top 0 3 35
Secret/Special 0 3 35
Access 0 3 35
Program 0 3 35
level 0 3 35
when 0 3 35
they 0 3 35
were 0 3 35
sent 0 3 35
and 0 3 35
received 0 3 35
by 0 3 35
Clinton. 0 3 35

Coupled 0 3 36
with 0 3 36
her 0 3 36
agents’ 0 3 36
destruction 0 3 36
of 0 3 36
thousands 0 3 36
of 0 3 36
e-mails 0 3 36
that 0 3 36
had 0 3 36
been 0 3 36
subpoenaed 0 3 36
by 0 3 36
Congress, 0 3 36
Hillary’s 0 3 36
conduct 0 3 36
was 0 3 36
criminally 1 3 36
reckless 1 3 36
at 0 3 36
the 0 3 36
very 0 3 36
least, 0 3 36
if 0 3 36
not 0 3 36
constituting 0 3 36
willful 1 3 36
intent 1 3 36
to 1 3 36
commit 1 3 36
an 1 3 36
act 1 3 36
she 1 3 36
knew 1 3 36
was 1 3 36
wrongful. 1 3 36

Yet 0 3 37
Mr. 0 3 37
Horowitz 0 3 37
saw 0 3 37
no 0 3 37
reason 0 3 37
to 0 3 37
doubt 0 3 37
the 0 3 37
sincerity 0 3 37
of 0 3 37
Comey's 0 3 37
explanations 0 3 37
for 0 3 37
giving 0 3 37
Hillary 0 3 37
a 0 3 37
free 0 3 37
pass. 0 3 37

The 0 3 38
failure 0 3 38
to 0 3 38
at 0 3 38
least 0 3 38
empanel 0 3 38
a 0 3 38
grand 0 3 38
jury 0 3 38
to 0 3 38
compel 0 3 38
testimony 0 3 38
from 0 3 38
Hillary 0 3 38
Clinton 0 3 38
and 0 3 38
key 0 3 38
witnesses 0 3 38
was 0 3 38
itself 0 3 38
a 0 3 38
complete 0 3 38
dereliction 0 3 38
of 0 3 38
duty, 0 3 38
which 0 3 38
could 0 3 38
have 0 3 38
only 0 3 38
been 0 3 38
motivated 0 3 38
by 0 3 38
a 0 3 38
desire 0 3 38
to 0 3 38
treat 1 3 38
Hillary 1 3 38
Clinton 1 3 38
with 1 3 38
kid 1 3 38
gloves 1 3 38
for 0 3 38
improper 0 3 38
reasons. 0 3 38

Incredibly, 0 3 39
however, 0 3 39
Mr. 0 3 39
Horowitz’s 0 3 39
report 0 3 39
“found 0 3 39
no 0 3 39
persuasive 0 3 39
evidence… 0 3 39
that 0 3 39
the 0 3 39
outcome 0 3 39
of 0 3 39
the 0 3 39
investigation 0 3 39
would 0 3 39
have 0 3 39
been 0 3 39
different 0 3 39
had 0 3 39
Clinton 0 3 39
been 0 3 39
subpoenaed 0 3 39
before 0 3 39
the 0 3 39
grand 0 3 39
jury.” 0 3 39

Mr. 0 3 40
Horowitz 0 3 40
also 0 3 40
did 0 3 40
not 0 3 40
deem 0 3 40
Comey’s 0 3 40
possible 0 3 40
perjury 0 3 40
in 0 3 40
his 0 3 40
testimony 0 3 40
before 0 3 40
Congress 0 3 40
to 0 3 40
be 0 3 40
an 0 3 40
appropriate 0 3 40
subject 0 3 40
for 0 3 40
criminal 0 3 40
referral. 0 3 40

Comey 0 3 41
testified 0 3 41
that 0 3 41
his 0 3 41
decision 0 3 41
to 0 3 41
exonerate 0 3 41
Hillary 0 3 41
was 0 3 41
not 0 3 41
made 0 3 41
before 0 3 41
her 0 3 41
interview 0 3 41
took 0 3 41
place, 0 3 41
when 0 3 41
for 0 3 41
all 0 3 41
intents 0 3 41
and 0 3 41
purposes 0 3 41
it 0 3 41
was. 0 3 41

Mr. 0 3 42
Horowitz 0 3 42
simply 0 3 42
took 0 3 42
Comey’s 0 3 42
word 0 3 42
for 0 3 42
what 0 3 42
he 0 3 42
had 0 3 42
meant. 0 3 42

Inspector 0 3 43
General 0 3 43
Horowitz 0 3 43
again 0 3 43
emphasized 0 3 43
form 0 3 43
and 0 3 43
process 0 3 43
over 0 3 43
substance 0 3 43
in 0 3 43
finding 0 3 43
a 0 3 43
“troubling 0 3 43
lack 0 3 43
of 0 3 43
any 0 3 43
direct, 0 3 43
substantive 0 3 43
communication” 0 3 43
between 0 3 43
Comey 0 3 43
and 0 3 43
Attorney 0 3 43
General 0 3 43
Lynch 0 3 43
ahead 0 3 43
of 0 3 43
Comey’s 0 3 43
July 0 3 43
5 0 3 43
press 0 3 43
conference 0 3 43
on 0 3 43
Clinton 0 3 43
and 0 3 43
his 0 3 43
October 0 3 43
28 0 3 43
letter 0 3 43
to 0 3 43
Congress. 0 3 43

Attorney 0 3 44
General 0 3 44
Lynch’s 0 3 44
infamous 1 3 44
tarmac 0 3 44
meeting 0 3 44
with 0 3 44
Bill 0 3 44
Clinton 0 3 44
was 0 3 44
discussed 0 3 44
in 0 3 44
the 0 3 44
report, 0 3 44
but 0 3 44
mostly 0 3 44
in 0 3 44
the 0 3 44
context 0 3 44
of 0 3 44
how 0 3 44
it 0 3 44
affected 0 3 44
Comey’s 0 3 44
decision 0 3 44
to 0 3 44
go 0 3 44
rogue, 0 3 44
so 0 3 44
to 0 3 44
speak, 0 3 44
in 0 3 44
making 0 3 44
his 0 3 44
July 0 3 44
5th 0 3 44
announcement 0 3 44
without 0 3 44
prior 0 3 44
approval 0 3 44
from 0 3 44
the 0 3 44
Justice 0 3 44
Department. 0 3 44

As 0 3 45
to 0 3 45
the 0 3 45
substance 0 3 45
of 0 3 45
Ms. 0 3 45
Lynch’s 0 3 45
decision 0 3 45
to 0 3 45
meet 0 3 45
with 0 3 45
Bill 0 3 45
Clinton 0 3 45
at 0 3 45
all 0 3 45
before 0 3 45
his 0 3 45
wife’s 0 3 45
FBI 0 3 45
interview, 0 3 45
all 0 3 45
Mr. 0 3 45
Horowitz’s 0 3 45
report 0 3 45
had 0 3 45
to 0 3 45
say 0 3 45
was 0 3 45
that 0 3 45
it 0 3 45
was 0 3 45
“an 0 3 45
error 0 3 45
in 0 3 45
judgment.” 0 3 45

The 0 3 46
OIG 0 3 46
report 0 3 46
also 0 3 46
criticized 0 3 46
the 0 3 46
conduct 0 3 46
of 0 3 46
Peter 0 3 46
Strzok 0 3 46
and 0 3 46
Lisa 0 3 46
Page, 0 3 46
who 0 3 46
had 0 3 46
exchanged 0 3 46
text 0 3 46
messages 0 3 46
sharply 1 3 46
critical 1 3 46
of 1 3 46
Mr. 1 3 46
Trump 1 3 46
before 0 3 46
and 0 3 46
after 0 3 46
the 0 3 46
election, 0 3 46
for 0 3 46
casting 0 3 46
“a 0 3 46
cloud 0 3 46
over 0 3 46
the 0 3 46
entire 0 3 46
FBI 0 3 46
investigation.” 0 3 46
The 0 3 46
report 0 3 46
referenced 0 3 46
a 0 3 46
text 0 3 46
message 0 3 46
on 0 3 46
August 0 3 46
8, 0 3 46
2016, 0 3 46
in 0 3 46
which 0 3 46
Strzok 0 3 46
reassured 0 3 46
Page 0 3 46
that 0 3 46
she 0 3 46
need 0 3 46
not 0 3 46
worry 0 3 46
about 0 3 46
Donald 0 3 46
Trump 0 3 46
becoming 0 3 46
president. 0 3 46

Trump 0 3 47
is 0 3 47
“not 0 3 47
ever 0 3 47
going 0 3 47
to 0 3 47
become 0 3 47
president, 0 3 47
right? 0 3 47

Right? 0 3 48

!” 0 3 49
Page 0 3 49
texted 0 3 49
Strzok. 0 3 49

“No. 0 3 50

No 0 3 51
he’s 0 3 51
not. 0 3 51

We’ll 0 3 52
stop 0 3 52
it,” 0 3 52
Strzok 0 3 52
responded. 0 3 52

Mr. 0 3 53
Horowitz 0 3 53
wrote 0 3 53
that 0 3 53
this 0 3 53
exchange 0 3 53
was 0 3 53
“not 0 3 53
only 0 3 53
indicative 0 3 53
of 0 3 53
a 0 3 53
biased 0 3 53

even 0 3 53
more 0 3 53
seriously, 0 3 53
implies 0 3 53
a 0 3 53
willingness 0 3 53
to 0 3 53
take 0 3 53
official 0 3 53
action 0 3 53
to 0 3 53
impact 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
presidential 0 3 53
candidate’s 0 3 53
electoral 0 3 53
prospects.” 0 3 53
The 0 3 53
inspector 0 3 53
general 0 3 53
questioned 0 3 53
whether 0 3 53
Strzok’s 0 3 53
decision 0 3 53
to 0 3 53
prioritize 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
Russia 0 3 53
collusion 0 3 53
investigation 0 3 53
over 0 3 53
following 0 3 53
up 0 3 53
on 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
Clinton 0 3 53
e-mail-related 0 3 53
investigative 0 3 53
lead 0 3 53
discovered 0 3 53
on 0 3 53
the 0 3 53
Weiner 0 3 53
laptop 0 3 53
was 0 3 53
free 0 3 53
from 0 3 53
bias. 0 3 53

Ultimately, 0 3 54
however, 0 3 54
he 0 3 54
inexplicably 1 3 54
concluded 1 3 54
that 0 3 54
there 0 3 54
was 0 3 54
no 0 3 54
finding 0 3 54
of 0 3 54
“documentary 0 3 54
or 0 3 54
testimonial 0 3 54
evidence 0 3 54
that 0 3 54
improper 0 3 54
considerations, 0 3 54
including 0 3 54
political 0 3 54
bias, 0 3 54
directly 0 3 54

discussed 0 3 54
in 0 3 54
the 0 3 54
OIG 0 3 54
report. 0 3 54

Strzok 0 3 55
should 0 3 55
have 0 3 55
been 0 3 55
subject 0 3 55
to 0 3 55
a 0 3 55
criminal 0 3 55
referral 0 3 55
for 0 3 55
arguably 0 3 55
violating 0 3 55
18 0 3 55
U.S.C. 0 3 55

§ 0 3 56
595, 0 3 56
enacted 0 3 56

of 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
original 0 3 56
1939 0 3 56
Hatch 0 3 56
Act, 0 3 56
prohibiting 0 3 56
any 0 3 56
public 0 3 56
officer 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
employee, 0 3 56
in 0 3 56
connection 0 3 56
with 0 3 56
an 0 3 56
activity 0 3 56
financed 0 3 56
wholly 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
in 0 3 56
part 0 3 56
by 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
United 0 3 56

from 0 3 56
using 0 3 56
his 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
her 0 3 56
official 0 3 56
authority 0 3 56
to 0 3 56
interfere 0 3 56
with 0 3 56
or 0 3 56
affect 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
nomination 0 3 56

election 0 3 56
of 0 3 56
a 0 3 56

the 0 3 56
president 0 3 56
of 0 3 56
the 0 3 56
United 0 3 56
States. 0 3 56

The 0 3 57
punishment 0 3 57
for 0 3 57
violation 0 3 57
is 0 3 57
a 0 3 57
fine, 0 3 57
imprisonment 0 3 57
for 0 3 57
not 0 3 57
more 0 3 57
than 0 3 57
one 0 3 57
year 0 3 57
or 0 3 57
both. 0 3 57

Instead, 0 3 58
Strzok's 0 3 58
punishment 0 3 58
will 0 3 58
most 0 3 58
likely 0 3 58
be 0 3 58
limited 0 3 58
to 0 3 58
disciplinary 0 3 58
action 0 3 58
and 0 3 58
possibly 0 3 58

at 0 7 15
the 0 7 15

writes 0 19 6
Royal, 0 19 6
“has 0 19 6
little 0 19 6

When 0 19 7
the 0 19 7

of 0 19 7
the 0 19 7
Church 0 19 7
himself 0 19 7

not 0 19 7

inherited, 0 19 7
what 0 19 7
then?” 0 19 7
What 0 19 7
then 0 19 7
indeed? 0 19 7

The 1 19 8
Dictator 1 19 8
Pope 1 19 8
even 0 19 8
feels 0 19 8
at 0 19 8
liberty 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
demand 0 19 8
that 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
Lord’s 0 19 8
Prayer 0 19 8
be 0 19 8
changed 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
reflect 0 19 8
his 0 19 8
dissatisfaction 0 19 8
with 0 19 8
God’s 0 19 8
words: 0 19 8
“And 0 19 8
lead 0 19 8
us 0 19 8
not 0 19 8
into 0 19 8
temptation 0 19 8
[et 0 19 8
ne 0 19 8
nos 0 19 8
inducas 0 19 8
in 0 19 8
tentationem],” 0 19 8
which 0 19 8
Francis 0 19 8
has 0 19 8
decided, 0 19 8
after 0 19 8
2,000 0 19 8
years, 0 19 8
is 0 19 8
a 0 19 8
“not 0 19 8
a 0 19 8
good 0 19 8
translation.” 0 19 8
Apparently 0 19 8
lost 0 19 8
on 0 19 8
Francis, 0 19 8
given 1 19 8
the 1 19 8
disordered 1 19 8
mélange 1 19 8
of 1 19 8
bits 1 19 8
and 1 19 8
pieces 1 19 8
of 1 19 8
things 1 19 8
he 1 19 8
has 1 19 8
read 1 19 8
that 1 19 8
constitutes 1 19 8
his 1 19 8
theology, 1 19 8
is 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
distinction 0 19 8
between 0 19 8
sin, 0 19 8
a 0 19 8
culpable 0 19 8
act, 0 19 8
and 0 19 8
temptation, 0 19 8
which 0 19 8
arises 0 19 8
from 0 19 8
concupiscence 0 19 8
or 0 19 8
what 0 19 8
Saint 0 19 8
Thomas 0 19 8
called 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
fomes, 0 19 8
or 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
fleshly 0 19 8
inclination 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
sin, 0 19 8
which 0 19 8
grace 0 19 8
enables 0 19 8
us 0 19 8
to 0 19 8
control 0 19 8
by 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
rule 0 19 8
of 0 19 8
reason 0 19 8
over 0 19 8
the 0 19 8
passions. 0 19 8

But 0 19 9
now 0 19 9
we 0 19 9
are 0 19 9
witness 0 19 9
to 0 19 9
the 0 19 9
single 1 19 9
worst 1 19 9
act 1 19 9
of 1 19 9
tyranny 1 19 9
in 0 19 9
the 0 19 9
entire 0 19 9
history 0 19 9
of 0 19 9
the 0 19 9
papacy. 0 19 9

The 0 19 10
Church 0 19 10
has 0 19 10
seen 0 19 10
a 0 19 10
number 0 19 10
of 0 19 10
Popes 0 19 10
who 0 19 10
have 0 19 10
abused 0 19 10
their 0 19 10
power, 0 19 10
Alexander 0 19 10
VI 0 19 10
being 0 19 10
the 0 19 10
most 0 19 10
popularly 0 19 10
known 0 19 10
example. 0 19 10

But 1 19 11
never, 1 19 11
before 1 19 11
Francis, 1 19 11
has 1 19 11
there 1 19 11
been 1 19 11
a 1 19 11
Pope 1 19 11
who 1 19 11
dared 1 19 11
to 1 19 11
tyrannize 1 19 11
the 1 19 11
Magisterium 1 19 11
itself 1 19 11
by 1 19 11
attempting 1 19 11
to 1 19 11
bend 1 19 11
it 1 19 11
to 1 19 11
his 1 19 11
errant 1 19 11
personal 1 19 11
opinions. 1 19 11

By 0 19 12

in 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
Acta 0 19 12
Apostolicae 0 19 12
Sedis 0 19 12
(AAS), 0 19 12
Francis 0 19 12
has 0 19 12
officially 0 19 12
declared 0 19 12
that 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
“authentic 0 19 12
Magisterium” 0 19 12
includes 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
guidelines 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
bishops 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
Buenos 0 19 12
Aires 0 19 12
for 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
implementation 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
Chapter 0 19 12
8 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
Amoris 0 19 12
Laetitia 0 19 12
(AL), 0 19 12
which 0 19 12
he 0 19 12
expressly 0 19 12
approved 0 19 12
in 0 19 12
his 0 19 12
letter 0 19 12
to 0 19 12
them 0 19 12
as 0 19 12
the 0 19 12
only 0 19 12
correct 0 19 12
interpretation 0 19 12
of 0 19 12
his 0 19 12
will. 0 19 12

The 0 19 13
guidelines 0 19 13
have 0 19 13
been 0 19 13
published 0 19 13
in 0 19 13
the 0 19 13
AAS 0 19 13
along 0 19 13
with 0 19 13
Francis’s 0 19 13
private 0 19 13
missive, 0 19 13
which 0 19 13
is 0 19 13
suddenly 0 19 13
declared 0 19 13
to 0 19 13
be 0 19 13
“an 0 19 13
apostolic 0 19 13
letter.” 0 19 13

The 0 19 14
normalist 0 19 14
narrative 0 19 14
has 0 19 14
just 0 19 14
been 0 19 14
stripped 0 19 14
of 0 19 14
any 0 19 14
colorable 0 19 14
argument 0 19 14
that 0 19 14
nothing 0 19 14
is 0 19 14
too 0 19 14
terribly 0 19 14
amiss 0 19 14
with 0 19 14
this 0 19 14
pontificate. 0 19 14

We 0 19 15
are 0 19 15
now 0 19 15
expected 0 19 15
to 0 19 15
believe 0 19 15
that 0 19 15
the 0 19 15
“authentic 0 19 15
Magisterium”—meaning 0 19 15
simply 0 19 15
and 0 19 15
only 0 19 15
AL—teaches 0 19 15
what 0 19 15
the 0 19 15
guidelines 0 19 15
preposterously 0 19 15
declare, 0 19 15
solely 0 19 15
in 0 19 15
reliance 0 19 15
on 0 19 15
AL: 0 19 15

When 0 19 16
the 0 19 16
concrete 0 19 16
circumstances 0 19 16
of 0 19 16
a 0 19 16
couple 0 19 16
make 0 19 16
it 0 19 16
feasible, 0 19 16
especially 0 19 16
when 0 19 16
both 0 19 16
are 0 19 16
Christians 0 19 16
with 0 19 16
a 0 19 16
journey 0 19 16
of 0 19 16
faith, 0 19 16
one 0 19 16
may 0 19 16
propose 0 19 16
that 0 19 16
they 0 19 16
commit 0 19 16
to 0 19 16
living 0 19 16
in 0 19 16
continence…. 0 19 16

In 0 19 17
other 0 19 17
more 0 19 17
complex 0 19 17
circumstances, 0 19 17
and 0 19 17
when 0 19 17
it 0 19 17
is 0 19 17
not 0 19 17
possible 0 19 17
to 0 19 17
obtain 0 19 17
a 0 19 17
declaration 0 19 17
of 0 19 17
nullity, 0 19 17
the 0 19 17
aforementioned 0 19 17
option 0 19 17
may 0 19 17
not, 0 19 17
in 0 19 17
fact, 0 19 17
be 0 19 17
viable. 0 19 17

Nonetheless, 0 19 18
it 0 19 18
is 0 19 18
equally 0 19 18
possible 0 19 18
to 0 19 18
undertake 0 19 18
a 0 19 18
journey 0 19 18
of 0 19 18
discernment…. 0 19 18

[I]f 0 19 19
one 0 19 19
arrives 0 19 19
at 0 19 19
the 0 19 19
recognition 0 19 19
that, 0 19 19
in 0 19 19
a 0 19 19
concrete 0 19 19
case, 0 19 19
there 0 19 19
are 0 19 19
limitations 0 19 19
that 0 19 19
diminish 0 19 19
responsibility 0 19 19
and 0 19 19
culpability 0 19 19
(cf. 0 19 19

301-302), 0 19 20
particularly 0 19 20
when 0 19 20
a 0 19 20
person 0 19 20
judges 0 19 20
that 0 19 20
he 0 19 20
would 0 19 20
fall 0 19 20
into 0 19 20
a 0 19 20
subsequent 0 19 20
fault 0 19 20
by 0 19 20
damaging 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
children 0 19 20
of 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
new 0 19 20
union, 0 19 20
Amoris 0 19 20
Laetitia 0 19 20
opens 0 19 20
up 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
possibility 0 19 20
of 0 19 20
access 0 19 20
to 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
Sacraments 0 19 20
of 0 19 20
Reconciliation 0 19 20
and 0 19 20
the 0 19 20
Eucharist 0 19 20
(cf. 0 19 20

notes 0 19 21
336 0 19 21
and 0 19 21
351). 0 19 21

As 0 19 22
Francis 0 19 22
would 0 19 22
have 0 19 22
it, 0 19 22
then, 0 19 22
the 0 19 22
“authentic 0 19 22
Magisterium” 0 19 22
has 0 19 22
just 0 19 22
flatly 0 19 22
contradicted 0 19 22
itself 0 19 22
for 0 19 22
the 0 19 22
first 0 19 22
time 0 19 22
in 0 19 22
two 0 19 22
millennia: 0 19 22

The 0 19 23
admission 0 19 23
of 0 19 23
public 0 19 23
adulterers 0 19 23
in 0 19 23
“second 0 19 23
marriages” 0 19 23
to 0 19 23
Holy 0 19 23
Communion, 0 19 23
which 0 19 23
John 0 19 23

in 0 19 23
line 0 19 23
with 0 19 23
all 0 19 23
of 0 19 23
Tradition, 0 19 23
called 0 19 23
“ 0 19 23
intrinsically 0 19 23
impossible 0 19 23
” 0 19 23
given 0 19 23
their 0 19 23
objective 0 19 23
state 0 19 23
in 0 19 23
life, 0 19 23
is 0 19 23
now 0 19 23
deemed 0 19 23
possible 0 19 23
depending 0 19 23
on 0 19 23
circumstances—that 0 19 23
is, 0 19 23
situation 0 19 23
ethics 0 19 23
applied 0 19 23
to 0 19 23
violations 0 19 23
of 0 19 23
the 0 19 23
Sixth 0 19 23
Commandment. 0 19 23

The 0 19 24
requirement 0 19 24
that 0 19 24
people 0 19 24
embroiled 0 19 24
in 0 19 24
such 0 19 24
unions 0 19 24
commit 0 19 24
to 0 19 24
living 0 19 24
in 0 19 24
continence 0 19 24
before 0 19 24
they 0 19 24
can 0 19 24
be 0 19 24
absolved 0 19 24
and 0 19 24
partake 0 19 24
of 0 19 24
the 0 19 24
Blessed 0 19 24
Sacrament—a 0 19 24
moral 0 19 24
norm 0 19 24
binding 0 19 24
“ 0 19 24
without 0 19 24
exception 0 19 24
” 0 19 24
because 0 19 24
it 0 19 24
is 0 19 24
rooted 0 19 24
in 0 19 24
divine 0 19 24
law—is 0 19 24
suddenly 0 19 24
demoted 0 19 24
to 0 19 24
a 0 19 24
mere 0 19 24
“proposal” 0 19 24
that 0 19 24
may 0 19 24
not 0 19 24
be 0 19 24
“feasible” 0 19 24

in 0 19 24
“the 0 19 24
concrete 0 19 24
circumstances 0 19 24
of 0 19 24
the 0 19 24

A 0 19 25
valid 0 19 25
annulment 0 19 25
of 0 19 25
a 0 19 25

than 0 19 27
a 0 19 27
Roman 0 19 27

children 0 19 27

to 0 19 27
as 0 19 27
a 0 19 27

because 0 19 27
the 0 19 27

That 0 19 31

declared 0 19 31
the 0 19 31

the 0 19 31
Church.” 0 19 31

Francis, 0 19 32
however, 0 19 32
has 0 19 32
purported 0 19 32
to 0 19 32
do 0 19 32
nothing 0 19 32
less 0 19 32
invent 0 19 32
exceptions 0 19 32
to 0 19 32
divine 0 19 32
law 0 19 32
that 0 19 32
oppose 0 19 32
the 0 19 32
doctrine 0 19 32
of 0 19 32
the 0 19 32
Church. 0 19 32

The 0 19 33
attempt 0 19 33
is 0 19 33
void, 0 19 33
of 0 19 33
course, 0 19 33
and 0 19 33
the 0 19 33
appellation 0 19 33
“authentic 0 19 33
Magisterium” 0 19 33
is 0 19 33
fraudulent. 0 19 33

But 0 19 34
the 0 19 34
consequences 0 19 34
of 0 19 34
this 0 19 34
Pope’s 0 19 34
toying 1 19 34
with 1 19 34
the 1 19 34
teaching 1 19 34
office 1 19 34
of 0 19 34
the 0 19 34
Church 0 19 34
to 0 19 34
advance 0 19 34
half-baked 1 19 34
theological 1 19 34
notions, 1 19 34
such 0 19 34
as 0 19 34
“discernment” 0 19 34
(a 0 19 34
term 0 19 34
he 0 19 34
borrows 0 19 34
from 0 19 34
St. 0 19 34
Ignatius 0 19 34
of 0 19 34
Loyola 0 19 34
but 0 19 34
strips 0 19 34
of 0 19 34
its 0 19 34
original 0 19 34
meaning) 0 19 34
are 0 19 34
catastrophic. 0 19 34

Over 0 19 35
the 0 19 35
past 0 19 35
year, 0 19 35
Cardinal 0 19 35
Burke 0 19 35
and 0 19 35
a 0 19 35
few 0 19 35
other 0 19 35
members 0 19 35
of 0 19 35
the 0 19 35
hierarchy 0 19 35
have 0 19 35
called 0 19 35
upon 0 19 35
Francis 0 19 35
to 0 19 35
“clarify” 0 19 35
his 0 19 35
intention 0 19 35
respecting 0 19 35
AL. 0 19 35

That 0 19 36
clarification 0 19 36
has 0 19 36
now 0 19 36
been 0 19 36
given: 0 19 36
Francis 0 19 36
intends, 0 19 36
if 0 19 36
it 0 19 36
were 0 19 36
possible, 0 19 36
to 0 19 36
change 0 19 36
the 0 19 36
unchangeable 0 19 36
teaching 0 19 36
of 0 19 36
the 0 19 36
Church 0 19 36
regarding 0 19 36
an 0 19 36
irrevocable 0 19 36
moral 0 19 36
norm 0 19 36
rooted 0 19 36
in 0 19 36
divine 0 19 36
law. 0 19 36

Even 1 19 37
if 1 19 37
the 1 19 37
attempt 1 19 37
is 1 19 37
void 1 19 37
and 1 19 37
of 1 19 37
no 1 19 37
effect 1 19 37
before 1 19 37
man 1 19 37
and 1 19 37
God—an 1 19 37
immoral 1 19 37
law 1 19 37
is 1 19 37
no 1 19 37
law 1 19 37
at 1 19 37
all—Francis 0 19 37
clearly 0 19 37
means 0 19 37
to 0 19 37
impose 0 19 37
his 0 19 37
will 0 19 37
by 0 19 37
fiat, 0 19 37
daring 0 19 37
invoke 0 19 37
the 0 19 37
“authentic 0 19 37
Magisterium” 0 19 37
to 0 19 37
cloak 1 19 37
his 1 19 37
absurd 1 19 37
novelties. 1 19 37

No 1 19 38
Pope 1 19 38
before 1 19 38
him 1 19 38
has 1 19 38
ever 1 19 38
dared 1 19 38
to 1 19 38
do 1 19 38
such 1 19 38
a 1 19 38
thing. 1 19 38

So 0 19 39
now 0 19 39
it 0 19 39
must 0 19 39
be 0 19 39
asked: 0 19 39
Where 0 19 39
are 0 19 39
the 0 19 39
cardinals 0 19 39
and 0 19 39
the 0 19 39
bishops? 0 19 39

With 0 19 40
one 0 19 40
or 0 19 40
two 0 19 40
noble 0 19 40
(however 0 19 40
inconsistent) 0 19 40
exceptions, 0 19 40
their 0 19 40
response 0 19 40
to 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
Bergoglian 0 19 40
Debacle 0 19 40
thus 0 19 40
far 0 19 40
ranges 0 19 40
from 0 19 40
silence, 0 19 40
to 0 19 40
active 0 19 40
complicity, 0 19 40
to—at 0 19 40
best—hand-wringing 0 19 40
over 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
increasingly 0 19 40
chaotic 0 19 40
state 0 19 40
of 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
Church 0 19 40
while 0 19 40
begging 0 19 40
the 0 19 40
Pope 0 19 40
to 0 19 40
“clarify” 0 19 40
his 0 19 40
already 0 19 40
perfectly 0 19 40
clear 0 19 40
intentions. 0 19 40

At 0 19 41
this 0 19 41
point, 0 19 41
continued 0 19 41
pleading 0 19 41
for 0 19 41
a 0 19 41
Bergoglian 0 19 41
“clarification” 0 19 41
can 0 19 41
only 0 19 41
give 0 19 41
rise 0 19 41
to 0 19 41
an 0 19 41
impression 0 19 41
of 0 19 41
disingenuousness, 0 19 41
whereas 0 19 41
continued 0 19 41
silence 0 19 41
about 0 19 41
the 0 19 41
papal 0 19 41
origin 0 19 41
of 0 19 41
this 0 19 41
ongoing 0 19 41
catastrophe 0 19 41
is 1 19 41
a 1 19 41
standing 1 19 41
rebuke 1 19 41
to 1 19 41
all 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
hierarchs 1 19 41
who 1 19 41
know 1 19 41
what 1 19 41
we 1 19 41
all 1 19 41
know: 1 19 41
that 1 19 41
at 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
epicenter 1 19 41
of 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
chaos 1 19 41
is 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
most 1 19 41
wayward 1 19 41
Pope 1 19 41
the 1 19 41
Church 1 19 41
has 1 19 41
ever 1 19 41
had 1 19 41
to 1 19 41
endure. 1 19 41

Continued 1 19 42
inaction 1 19 42
while 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
laity 1 19 42
and 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
few 1 19 42
good 1 19 42
priests 1 19 42
are 1 19 42
left 1 19 42
to 1 19 42
themselves 1 19 42
to 1 19 42
defend, 1 19 42
as 1 19 42
best 1 19 42
they 1 19 42
can, 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
constant 1 19 42
teaching 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
Church 1 19 42
against 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
abuses 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
tyrant 1 19 42
on 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
Chair 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
Peter 1 19 42
threatens 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
hierarchs 1 19 42
with 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
legacy 1 19 42
of 1 19 42
shame 1 19 42
and 1 19 42
a 1 19 42
terrible 1 19 42
accountability 1 19 42
before 1 19 42
the 1 19 42
Just 1 19 42
Judge. 1 19 42

Their 0 19 43
failure 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
defend 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
Faith 0 19 43
by 0 19 43
standing 0 19 43
up 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
one 0 19 43
they 0 19 43
know 0 19 43
full 0 19 43
well 0 19 43
is 0 19 43
attacking 0 19 43
it 0 19 43
almost 0 19 43
daily 0 19 43
lends 0 19 43
itself 0 19 43
ever 0 19 43
more 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
an 0 19 43
indictment 0 19 43
for 0 19 43
timidity 0 19 43
in 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
face 0 19 43
of 0 19 43
unprecedented 0 19 43
danger 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
Church 0 19 43
and 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
cause 0 19 43
of 0 19 43
the 0 19 43
Gospel 0 19 43
of 0 19 43
which 0 19 43
they 0 19 43
are 0 19 43
divinely 0 19 43
charged 0 19 43
to 0 19 43
be 0 19 43
leaders. 0 19 43

The 1 19 44
time 1 19 44
for 1 19 44
“prudence” 1 19 44
is 1 19 44
long 1 19 44
past. 1 19 44

Prudence 0 19 45
now 0 19 45
gives 0 19 45
way 0 19 45
to 0 19 45
mere 0 19 45
pusillanimity. 0 19 45

The 0 19 46
time 0 19 46
for 0 19 46
hierarchical 0 19 46
action 0 19 46
is 0 19 46
now, 0 19 46
before 0 19 46
the 0 19 46
damage 0 19 46
to 0 19 46
the 0 19 46
Church 0 19 46
becomes 0 19 46
irreparable. 0 19 46

The 0 19 47
members 0 19 47
of 0 19 47
a 0 19 47
hierarchy 0 19 47
seemingly 0 19 47
cowed 0 19 47
by 0 19 47
a 1 19 47
papal 1 19 47
tyranny 1 19 47
the 1 19 47
Church 1 19 47
has 1 19 47
never 1 19 47
before 1 19 47
seen 1 19 47
must 0 19 47
rise 0 19 47
immediately 0 19 47
and 0 19 47
give 0 19 47
a 0 19 47
courageous 0 19 47
answer 0 19 47
to 0 19 47
the 0 19 47
challenge 0 19 47
posed 0 19 47
long 0 19 47
ago 0 19 47
by 0 19 47
Monsignor 0 19 47
Klaus 0 19 47
Gamber, 0 19 47
when 0 19 47
an 0 19 47
already 0 19 47
monumental 0 19 47
ecclesial 0 19 47
crisis 0 19 47
was 0 19 47
still 0 19 47
in 0 19 47
what 0 19 47
can 0 19 47
now 0 19 47
can 0 19 47
be 0 19 47
seen 0 19 47
as 0 19 47
merely 0 19 47
a 0 19 47
preliminary 0 19 47
stage: 0 19 47

Where 0 19 48
in 0 19 48
our 0 19 48
Church 0 19 48
are 0 19 48
the 0 19 48
leaders 0 19 48
who 0 19 48
can 0 19 48
show 0 19 48
us 0 19 48
the 0 19 48
right 0 19 48
path? 0 19 48

Where 0 19 49
are 0 19 49
the 0 19 49
bishops 0 19 49
courageous 0 19 49
enough 0 19 49
to 1 19 49
cut 1 19 49
out 1 19 49
the 1 19 49
cancerous 1 19 49
growth 1 19 49
of 1 19 49
modernist 1 19 49
theology 1 19 49
that 1 19 49
has 1 19 49
implanted 1 19 49
itself 1 19 49
and 1 19 49
is 1 19 49

What 0 19 50
we 0 19 50
need 0 19 50
today 0 19 50
is 0 19 50
a 0 19 50
new 0 19 50
Athanasius, 0 19 50
a 0 19 50
new 0 19 50
Basil, 0 19 50
bishops 0 19 50
like 0 19 50
those 0 19 50
who 0 19 50
in 0 19 50
the 0 19 50
fourth 0 19 50
century 0 19 50
fought 0 19 50
courageously 0 19 50
against 0 19 50
Arianism 0 19 50
when 0 19 50
almost 0 19 50
the 0 19 50
whole 0 19 50
of 0 19 50
Christendom 0 19 50
had 0 19 50
succumbed 0 19 50
to 0 19 50
heresy. 0 19 50

Will 0 19 51
none 0 19 51
of 0 19 51
the 0 19 51
hierarchs 0 19 51
rise 0 19 51
to 0 19 51
defend 0 19 51
the 0 19 51
Church 0 19 51
as 0 19 51
“a 0 19 51
new 0 19 51
Athanasius, 0 19 51
a 0 19 51
new 0 19 51
Basil”? 0 19 51

Even 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
best 0 19 52
among 0 19 52
them 0 19 52
continue 0 19 52
to 0 19 52
limit 0 19 52
themselves 0 19 52
to 0 19 52
generalized 0 19 52
lamentations 0 19 52
at 0 19 52
conferences 0 19 52
or 0 19 52
in 0 19 52
interviews 0 19 52
about 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
parlous 0 19 52
state 0 19 52
of 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
Church 0 19 52
or 0 19 52
at 0 19 52
most 0 19 52
the 0 19 52
“confusion” 0 19 52
Francis 0 19 52
has 0 19 52
caused 0 19 52
by 0 19 52
not 0 19 52
“clarifying” 0 19 52
precisely 0 19 52
what 0 19 52
he 0 19 52
has 0 19 52
just 0 19 52
clarified. 0 19 52

They 0 19 53
avoid 0 19 53
the 0 19 53
absolutely 0 19 53
necessary 0 19 53
direct 0 19 53
and 0 19 53
public 0 19 53
exposure 0 19 53
of 0 19 53
error 0 19 53
at 0 19 53
its 0 19 53
source. 0 19 53

That 1 19 54
error 1 19 54
threatens 1 19 54
to 1 19 54
overwhelm 1 19 54
the 1 19 54
Church 1 19 54
while 1 19 54
they 1 19 54
do 1 19 54
little 1 19 54
more 1 19 54
than 1 19 54
fret 1 19 54
about 1 19 54
a 1 19 54
situation 1 19 54
whose 1 19 54
self-evident 1 19 54
cause—a 1 19 54
reckless 1 19 54
Pope 1 19 54
in 1 19 54
love 1 19 54
with 1 19 54
his 1 19 54
own 1 19 54
ideas 1 19 54
and 1 19 54
filled 1 19 54
with 1 19 54
contempt 1 19 54
for 1 19 54
Tradition—they 1 19 54
seem 1 19 54
incapable 1 19 54
of 1 19 54
identifying. 1 19 54

Concerned 0 19 55
clergy 0 19 55
and 0 19 55
laity 0 19 55
throughout 0 19 55
the 0 19 55
Catholic 0 19 55
world 0 19 55
are 0 19 55
doing 0 19 55
what 0 19 55
they 0 19 55
can 0 19 55
according 0 19 55
to 0 19 55
their 0 19 55
stations. 0 19 55

But 0 19 56
in 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
midst 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
that 0 19 56
“final 0 19 56
battle” 0 19 56
over 0 19 56
marriage 0 19 56
and 0 19 56
family 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
which 0 19 56
Sister 0 19 56
Lucia 0 19 56
warned 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
late 0 19 56
Cardinal 0 19 56
Caffarra 0 19 56
in 0 19 56
light 0 19 56
of 0 19 56

within 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
human 0 19 56
element 0 19 56
of 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
Church 0 19 56
only 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
cardinals 0 19 56
and 0 19 56
the 0 19 56
bishops 0 19 56
possess 0 19 56
the 1 19 56
divinely 1 19 56
bestowed 1 19 56
power 1 19 56
to 1 19 56
repel 1 19 56
an 1 19 56
assault 1 19 56
on 1 19 56
marriage, 1 19 56
family 1 19 56
and 1 19 56
the 1 19 56
very 1 19 56
integrity 1 19 56
of 1 19 56
the 1 19 56
Faith 1 19 56
that 1 19 56
is 1 19 56
now, 1 19 56
for 1 19 56
the 1 19 56
first 1 19 56
time 1 19 56
in 1 19 56
Church 1 19 56
history, 1 19 56
being 0 19 56
led 0 19 56
by 0 19 56
a 0 19 56
Roman 0 19 56
Pontiff. 0 19 56

This 0 19 57
undeniably 0 19 57
apocalyptic 0 19 57
development 0 19 57
imposes 0 19 57
upon 0 19 57
the 0 19 57
hierarchs—first 0 19 57
and 0 19 57
foremost 0 19 57
in 0 19 57
the 0 19 57
Church—the 0 19 57
duty 0 19 57
to 0 19 57
act. 0 19 57

True 1 19 58
love 1 19 58
for 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
Church, 1 19 58
indeed 1 19 58
true 1 19 58
charity 1 19 58
toward 1 19 58
Francis 1 19 58
himself, 1 19 58
requires 1 19 58
of 1 19 58
them 1 19 58
nothing 1 19 58
less 1 19 58
than 1 19 58
what 1 19 58
was 1 19 58
required 1 19 58
of 1 19 58
Saint 1 19 58
Paul 1 19 58
when 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
first 1 19 58
Pope 1 19 58
fell 1 19 58
into 1 19 58
error 1 19 58
that 1 19 58
jeopardized 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
very 1 19 58
mission 1 19 58
of 1 19 58
the 1 19 58
Church: 1 19 58
that 1 19 58
Peter 1 19 58
be 1 19 58
withstood 1 19 58
to 1 19 58
his 1 19 58

New 0 22 4

came 0 22 4
together 0 22 4
for 0 22 4

entitled 0 22 4
“Francis 0 22 4
@ 0 22 4
Five: 0 22 4
Assessing 0 22 4
the 0 22 4
Legacy 0 22 4

Five 0 22 4
Years 0 22 4
after 0 22 4
His 0 22 4

As 0 22 4
I 0 22 4
made 0 22 4
my 0 22 4
way 0 22 4
up 0 22 4
to 0 22 4
Fordham 0 22 4
University, 0 22 4
I 0 22 4
was 0 22 4
excited. 0 22 4

Having 0 22 5
followed 0 22 5
Douthat 0 22 5
and 0 22 5
Faggioli’s 0 22 5
ongoing 0 22 5
dialogue 0 22 5
on 0 22 5

I 0 22 5
knew 0 22 5
I 0 22 5
was 0 22 5
in 0 22 5
for 0 22 5
a 0 22 5
lively, 0 22 5
if 0 22 5
predictable, 0 22 5
conversation. 0 22 5

In 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
opening 0 22 6
remarks, 0 22 6
Douthat 0 22 6
laid 0 22 6
out 0 22 6
three 0 22 6
criteria 0 22 6
that 0 22 6
can 0 22 6
be 0 22 6
used 0 22 6
to 0 22 6
evaluate 0 22 6
Francis’s 0 22 6
papacy 0 22 6
thus 0 22 6
far: 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
impact 0 22 6
on 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
public’s 0 22 6
perception 0 22 6
of 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
Church 0 22 6
(a 0 22 6
success); 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
attempts 0 22 6
at 0 22 6
reforming 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
Vatican 0 22 6
bureaucracy 0 22 6
(a 0 22 6
disappointment); 0 22 6
and 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
position 0 22 6
on 0 22 6
“moral-theological 0 22 6
controversies,” 0 22 6
specifically, 0 22 6

Faggioli, 0 22 9
meanwhile, 0 22 9
outlined 0 22 9
a 1 22 9
genuinely 1 22 9
surprising 1 22 9
position. 1 22 9

Rather 0 22 10
than 0 22 10
making 0 22 10
a 0 22 10
straightforward 0 22 10
case 0 22 10
for 0 22 10
why 0 22 10
Pope 0 22 10
Francis 0 22 10
has 0 22 10
changed 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
Church 0 22 10
for 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
better, 0 22 10
Faggioli 0 22 10
rejected 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
possibility 0 22 10
of 0 22 10
evaluating 0 22 10
his 0 22 10
papacy 0 22 10
in 0 22 10
terms 0 22 10
of 0 22 10
“continuity” 0 22 10
with 0 22 10
past 0 22 10
popes, 0 22 10
since 0 22 10
doing 0 22 10
so 0 22 10
would 0 22 10
assume 0 22 10
that 0 22 10
“Christianity 0 22 10
at 0 22 10
some 0 22 10
point 0 22 10
. 0 22 10

. 0 22 11

. 0 22 12

was 0 22 13
complete,” 0 22 13
which 0 22 13
Faggioli 0 22 13
does 0 22 13
not 0 22 13
think 0 22 13
is 0 22 13
true. 0 22 13

While 0 22 14
I 0 22 14
emphatically 0 22 14
disagree 0 22 14
with 0 22 14
this 0 22 14
argument, 0 22 14
I 0 22 14
have 0 22 14
to 0 22 14
hand 0 22 14
it 0 22 14
to 0 22 14
Faggioli: 0 22 14
From 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
outset, 0 22 14
he 0 22 14
made 0 22 14
clear 0 22 14
that 0 22 14
he 0 22 14
was 0 22 14
not 0 22 14
planning 0 22 14
to 0 22 14
debate 0 22 14
Douthat 0 22 14
on 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
implications 0 22 14
of 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
Francis 0 22 14
papacy. 0 22 14

Instead, 0 22 15
through 0 22 15
a 1 22 15
combination 1 22 15
of 1 22 15
rhetorical 1 22 15
tricks 1 22 15
and 1 22 15
soft-peddled 1 22 15
Hegelianism, 1 22 15
he 0 22 15
would 0 22 15
completely 0 22 15
redefine 0 22 15
the 0 22 15
role 0 22 15
and 0 22 15
nature 0 22 15
of 0 22 15
the 0 22 15
Catholic 0 22 15
Church. 0 22 15

During 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
crux 0 22 16
of 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
debate 0 22 16
— 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
discussion 0 22 16
of 0 22 16
communion 0 22 16
for 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
divorced 0 22 16
and 0 22 16
remarried 0 22 16
— 0 22 16
Faggioli 0 22 16
raised 0 22 16
his 1 22 16
most 1 22 16
theologically 1 22 16
unsettling 1 22 16
point. 1 22 16

To 0 22 17
defend 0 22 17
his 0 22 17
position 0 22 17
that 0 22 17
remarried 0 22 17
persons 0 22 17
should 0 22 17
be 0 22 17
able 0 22 17
to 0 22 17
receive 0 22 17
communion, 0 22 17
Faggioli 0 22 17
invoked 0 22 17
the 0 22 17
case 0 22 17
of 0 22 17
Germany, 0 22 17
where 0 22 17
50 0 22 17
percent 0 22 17
of 0 22 17
Catholic 0 22 17
marriages 0 22 17
end 0 22 17
in 0 22 17
divorce. 0 22 17

For 1 22 18
Faggioli, 1 22 18
the 1 22 18
implication 1 22 18
is 1 22 18
that 1 22 18
at 1 22 18
least 1 22 18
50 1 22 18
percent 1 22 18
of 1 22 18
German 1 22 18
Catholic 1 22 18
children 1 22 18
never 1 22 18
see 1 22 18
their 1 22 18
parents 1 22 18
receive 1 22 18
communion 1 22 18
and 1 22 18
lose 1 22 18
their 1 22 18
faith 1 22 18
because 1 22 18
of 1 22 18
it. 1 22 18

This, 0 22 19
he 0 22 19
says, 0 22 19
is 0 22 19
“bad 1 22 19
for 1 22 19
evangelization,” 1 22 19
and 0 22 19
in 0 22 19
order 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
keep 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
pews 0 22 19
full, 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
Church’s 0 22 19
role 0 22 19
should 0 22 19
not 0 22 19
be 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
deny 0 22 19
communion 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
divorced 0 22 19
and 0 22 19
remarried, 0 22 19
but 0 22 19
instead 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
ask, 0 22 19
“What 0 22 19
can 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
Catholic 0 22 19
Church 0 22 19
do 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
make 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
faithful 0 22 19
able 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
receive 0 22 19
sacraments?” 0 22 19

This 0 22 21
is 0 22 21
a 1 22 21
lovely 1 22 21
suggestion, 1 22 21
and 0 22 21
one 0 22 21
that 0 22 21
I’m 0 22 21
not 0 22 21
entirely 0 22 21
unsympathetic 0 22 21
to. 0 22 21

However, 0 22 22
the 0 22 22
fact 0 22 22
remains 0 22 22
that 0 22 22
Faggioli 0 22 22
is 0 22 22
suggesting 0 22 22
the 0 22 22
Church 0 22 22
do 0 22 22
much 0 22 22
more 0 22 22
than 0 22 22
provide 0 22 22
sacraments 0 22 22
to 0 22 22
the 0 22 22
faithful. 0 22 22

Just 0 22 23
before 0 22 23
invoking 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
German 0 22 23
case, 0 22 23
Faggioli 0 22 23
characterized 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
country 0 22 23
as 0 22 23
one 0 22 23
of 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
most 0 22 23
secular 0 22 23
in 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
world. 0 22 23

But 0 22 24
rather 0 22 24
than 0 22 24
lamenting 0 22 24
what 0 22 24
secularism 0 22 24
has 0 22 24
wrought 0 22 24
on 0 22 24
marital 0 22 24
life 0 22 24
in 0 22 24
Germany, 0 22 24
reasserting 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
Church’s 0 22 24
position 0 22 24
on 0 22 24
marriage, 0 22 24
and 0 22 24
insisting 0 22 24
that 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
faithful 0 22 24
strive 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
live 0 22 24
according 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
her 0 22 24
laws, 0 22 24
Faggioli 0 22 24
argues 0 22 24
that 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
Church 0 22 24
ought 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
bend 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
will 0 22 24
of 0 22 24
secular 0 22 24
society. 0 22 24

It 0 22 26
should 0 22 26
be 0 22 26
clear 0 22 26
to 0 22 26
anyone, 0 22 26
not 0 22 26
just 0 22 26
practicing 0 22 26
Catholics, 0 22 26
that 0 22 26
this 0 22 26
is 0 22 26
absurd. 0 22 26

If 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Church 0 22 27
exists 0 22 27
simply 0 22 27
to 0 22 27
accommodate 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
whims 0 22 27
and 0 22 27
failures 0 22 27
of 0 22 27
secular 0 22 27
modernity, 0 22 27
then 0 22 27
what 0 22 27
is 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
point 0 22 27
of 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Church? 0 22 27

Pope 0 22 28
Benedict 0 22 28
XVI 0 22 28
has 0 22 28
warned 0 22 28
against 0 22 28
precisely 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
kind 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
“accommodation” 0 22 28
Faggioli 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
calling 0 22 28
for, 0 22 28
writing 0 22 28
that 0 22 28
when 0 22 28
“the 0 22 28
people 0 22 28
cannot 0 22 28
cope” 0 22 28
with 0 22 28
God, 0 22 28
they 0 22 28
“bring 0 22 28
him 0 22 28
down 0 22 28
into 0 22 28
their 0 22 28
own 0 22 28
world,” 0 22 28
and 0 22 28
insist 0 22 28
that 0 22 28
“he 0 22 28
must 0 22 28
be 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
kind 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
God 0 22 28
that 0 22 28
[they 0 22 28
need].” 0 22 28
In 0 22 28
other 0 22 28
words, 0 22 28
“Man 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
using 0 22 28
God, 0 22 28
and, 0 22 28
in 0 22 28
reality, 0 22 28
even 0 22 28
if 0 22 28
it 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
not 0 22 28
outwardly 0 22 28
discernible, 0 22 28
he 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
placing 0 22 28
himself 0 22 28
above 0 22 28
God.” 0 22 28
To 0 22 28
fully 0 22 28
drive 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
point 0 22 28
home, 0 22 28
Benedict 0 22 28
equates 0 22 28
this 0 22 28
kind 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
worship 0 22 28
with 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
Israelites 0 22 28
desert 0 22 28
worship 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
bull 0 22 28
calf. 0 22 28

Unsurprisingly, 0 22 29
this 0 22 29
progressive 0 22 29
interpretation 0 22 29
of 0 22 29
Catholic 0 22 29
doctrine 0 22 29
eventually 0 22 29
reveals 0 22 29
itself 0 22 29
to 0 22 29
be 0 22 29
rank 1 22 29
historicism. 1 22 29

Throughout 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
debate, 0 22 30
Faggioli 0 22 30
drew 0 22 30
out 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
argument 0 22 30
that 0 22 30
allowing 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
remarried 0 22 30
to 0 22 30
receive 0 22 30
communion 0 22 30
would 0 22 30
not 0 22 30
represent 0 22 30
a 0 22 30
radical 0 22 30
change 0 22 30
in 0 22 30
doctrine 0 22 30
but 0 22 30
a 0 22 30
return 0 22 30
to 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
teachings 0 22 30
of 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
Gospel. 0 22 30

Eventually, 0 22 31
Douthat 0 22 31
drew 0 22 31
his 0 22 31
argument 0 22 31
to 0 22 31
its 0 22 31
logical 0 22 31
conclusion 0 22 31
with 0 22 31
this 0 22 31
question: 0 22 31
Were 1 22 31
priests 1 22 31
throughout 1 22 31
history 1 22 31
in 1 22 31
fact 1 22 31
misleading 1 22 31
their 1 22 31
divorced 1 22 31
and 1 22 31
remarried 1 22 31
parishioners 1 22 31
by 1 22 31
telling 1 22 31
them 1 22 31
they 1 22 31
could 1 22 31
not 1 22 31
receive 1 22 31
communion? 1 22 31

After 0 22 32
a 0 22 32
few 0 22 32
seconds’ 0 22 32
pause, 0 22 32
Faggioli 0 22 32
gave 0 22 32
the 0 22 32
only 0 22 32
answer 0 22 32
he 0 22 32
could: 0 22 32
“There 1 22 32
are 1 22 32
different 1 22 32
responses 1 22 32
to 1 22 32
the 1 22 32
same 1 22 32
question 1 22 32
in 1 22 32
different 1 22 32
times.” 1 22 32

Throughout 0 22 34
their 0 22 34
conversation, 0 22 34
both 0 22 34
Douthat 0 22 34
and 0 22 34
Faggioli 0 22 34
repeatedly 0 22 34
observed 0 22 34
that 0 22 34
the 0 22 34
debate 0 22 34
over 0 22 34
Pope 0 22 34
Francis 0 22 34
and 0 22 34
the 0 22 34
future 0 22 34
of 0 22 34
the 0 22 34
Church 0 22 34
is 0 22 34
carried 0 22 34
on 0 22 34
primarily 0 22 34
among 0 22 34
Catholic 0 22 34
intellectuals, 0 22 34
unbeknownst 0 22 34
to 0 22 34
most 0 22 34
of 0 22 34
“the 0 22 34
flock.” 0 22 34

Advertisement 0 22 35

It 0 22 36
strikes 0 22 36
me, 0 22 36
however, 0 22 36
that 0 22 36
everybody 0 22 36
— 0 22 36
Catholic 0 22 36
or 0 22 36
not 0 22 36
— 0 22 36
has 1 22 36
a 1 22 36
dog 1 22 36
in 1 22 36
this 1 22 36
fight, 1 22 36
which 0 22 36
is 0 22 36
about 0 22 36
more 0 22 36
than 0 22 36
communion 0 22 36
and 0 22 36
canon 0 22 36
law. 0 22 36

At 0 22 37
its 0 22 37
core, 0 22 37
this 0 22 37
debate 0 22 37
is 0 22 37
about 0 22 37
truth 0 22 37
and 0 22 37
our 0 22 37
ability 0 22 37
to 0 22 37
judge 0 22 37
right 0 22 37
from 0 22 37
wrong. 0 22 37

Could 1 22 38
we 1 22 38
possibly 1 22 38
say, 1 22 38
for 1 22 38
instance, 1 22 38
that 1 22 38
it’s 1 22 38
impossible 1 22 38
to 1 22 38
judge 1 22 38
the 1 22 38
presidency 1 22 38
of 1 22 38
Donald 1 22 38
Trump 1 22 38
relative 1 22 38
to 1 22 38
past 1 22 38
presidents? 1 22 38

Of 0 22 39
course 0 22 39
not 0 22 39
— 0 22 39
that 0 22 39
would 0 22 39
be 0 22 39
preposterous, 0 22 39
as 0 22 39
I’m 0 22 39
sure 0 22 39
Faggioli 0 22 39
would 0 22 39
agree. 0 22 39

To 0 22 40
pass 0 22 40
moral 0 22 40
judgements 0 22 40
on 0 22 40
papacies, 0 22 40
presidencies, 0 22 40
or 0 22 40
anything 0 22 40
else, 0 22 40
we 0 22 40
must 0 22 40
have 0 22 40
recourse 0 22 40
to 0 22 40
truth, 0 22 40
and 0 22 40
to 0 22 40
the 0 22 40
institutions 0 22 40
that 0 22 40
have 0 22 40
upheld 0 22 40
this 0 22 40
truth 0 22 40
for 0 22 40
centuries. 0 22 40

Whether 0 22 41
in 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
Church 0 22 41
or 0 22 41
in 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
academy, 0 22 41
we 0 22 41
must 0 22 41
resist 0 22 41
this 0 22 41
dangerous 0 22 41
historicist 0 22 41
impulse. 0 22 41

If 1 22 42
we 1 22 42
don’t, 1 22 42
we 1 22 42
will 1 22 42
find 1 22 42
ourselves, 1 22 42
in 1 22 42
the 1 22 42
words 1 22 42
of 1 22 42
Pope 1 22 42
Benedict, 1 22 42
in 1 22 42
“a 1 22 42
dictatorship 1 22 42
of 1 22 42
relativism 1 22 42
that 1 22 42
does 1 22 42
not 1 22 42
recognize 1 22 42
anything 1 22 42
as 1 22 42
definitive 1 22 42
and 1 22 42
whose 1 22 42
ultimate 1 22 42
goal 1 22 42
consists 1 22 42
solely 1 22 42
of 1 22 42
one’s 1 22 42
own 1 22 42

Leeann 0 37 5
Tweeden, 0 37 5
a 0 37 5
radio 0 37 5
news 0 37 5
anchor, 0 37 5
says 0 37 5
Franken 0 37 5
groped 0 37 5
and 0 37 5
forcibly 0 37 5
kissed 0 37 5
her 0 37 5
during 0 37 5
a 0 37 5
USO 0 37 5
tour 0 37 5
in 0 37 5
2006, 0 37 5
before 0 37 5
the 0 37 5
former 0 37 5
comedian 0 37 5
was 0 37 5
a 0 37 5
senator. 0 37 5

She 0 37 6
says 0 37 6
Franken 0 37 6
"aggressively 1 37 6
stuck 1 37 6
his 1 37 6
tongue 1 37 6
in 1 37 6
my 1 37 6
mouth" 1 37 6
when 0 37 6
the 0 37 6
pair 0 37 6
rehearsed 0 37 6

of 0 37 12
the 0 37 12

that 0 37 12

a 0 37 15

following 0 37 15
that 0 37 15

Franken's 1 37 15

has 1 37 15
not 1 37 15

She 0 37 19
says 0 37 19
she 0 37 19
avoided 0 37 19
the 0 37 19

the 0 44 4

The 0 44 5

had 0 44 5
been 0 44 5
accused 0 44 5
of 0 44 5

“When 0 44 5

Jim 1 44 6

a 0 44 7
devastating 1 44 7

the 0 44 7
“textbook 0 44 7

bias.” 0 44 7
Democrats 0 44 7
echoed 0 44 7
the 0 44 7
IG 0 44 7
report’s 0 44 7
conclusion 0 44 7
that 0 44 7
there 0 44 7
was 0 44 7
no 0 44 7
bias. 0 44 7

Republicans 0 44 8
sought 0 44 8
to 0 44 8
tie 0 44 8
up 0 44 8
some 0 44 8
loose 0 44 8
threads. 0 44 8

The 0 44 9
IG 0 44 9
report 0 44 9
confirmed 0 44 9
that 0 44 9
President 0 44 9

Horowitz 0 44 10
said 0 44 10
the 0 44 10
president 0 44 10
had 0 44 10
been 0 44 10
one 0 44 10
of 0 44 10
13 0 44 10
who 0 44 10
had 0 44 10
done 0 44 10
so. 0 44 10

Rep. 0 44 11
Steve 0 44 11
King 0 44 11
asked 0 44 11
about 0 44 11
the 0 44 11
volume 0 44 11

between 0 44 11

“I’ll 0 44 12
have 0 44 12
to 0 44 12
get 0 44 12
back 0 44 12
to 0 44 12
you 0 44 12
on 0 44 12
that,” 0 44 12
Horowitz 0 44 12
said, 0 44 12
and 0 44 12
the 0 44 12
IG 0 44 12
was 0 44 12
“not 0 44 12
sure” 0 44 12
if 0 44 12
any 0 44 12
of 0 44 12
the 0 44 12
communications 0 44 12
had 0 44 12
involved 0 44 12
classified 0 44 12
or 0 44 12
top 0 44 12
secret 0 44 12
material. 0 44 12

If 0 44 13
the 0 44 13
IG 0 44 13
did 0 44 13
know 0 44 13
the 0 44 13
subject 0 44 13
of 0 44 13
the 0 44 13
president’s 0 44 13
communications 0 44 13
with 0 44 13
Clinton, 0 44 13
he 0 44 13
failed 0 44 13
to 0 44 13
reveal 0 44 13
any 0 44 13
details. 0 44 13

Horowitz 0 44 14
“would 0 44 14
have 0 44 14
to 0 44 14
ask” 0 44 14
if 0 44 14
his 0 44 14
team 0 44 14
interviewed 0 44 14
any 0 44 14
officials 0 44 14
at 0 44 14
the 0 44 14
Obama 0 44 14
White 0 44 14
House 0 44 14
but 0 44 14
said 0 44 14
“not 0 44 14
the 0 44 14
president 0 44 14
himself.” 0 44 14

Rep. 0 44 15
King 0 44 15
asked 0 44 15
Horowitz 0 44 15
about 0 44 15
his 0 44 15
first 0 44 15
encounter 0 44 15
with 0 44 15
the 0 44 15
switch 0 44 15
of 0 44 15
“extremely 1 44 15
careless” 1 44 15
for 0 44 15
‘gross 1 44 15
negligence,” 1 44 15
which 0 44 15
violated 0 44 15
a 0 44 15
criminal 0 44 15
statute. 0 44 15

Horowitz 0 44 16
found 0 44 16
that 0 44 16
Peter 0 44 16
Strzok, 0 44 16
Lisa 0 44 16
Page, 0 44 16
and 0 44 16
James 0 44 16
Comey 0 44 16
were 0 44 16
all 0 44 16
involved. 0 44 16

The 0 44 17
IG 0 44 17
also 0 44 17
said 0 44 17
his 0 44 17
team 0 44 17
focused 0 44 17
on 0 44 17
the 0 44 17
fact 0 44 17
that 0 44 17
the 0 44 17
classified 0 44 17
material 0 44 17
on 0 44 17
Clinton’s 0 44 17
server 0 44 17
was 0 44 17
“not 0 44 17
clearly 0 44 17
marked,” 0 44 17
which 0 44 17
repeated 0 44 17
one 0 44 17
of 0 44 17
Clinton’s 0 44 17
claims 0 44 17
about 0 44 17
her 0 44 17
negligence. 1 44 17

As 0 44 18
for 0 44 18
the 0 44 18
question 0 44 18
of 0 44 18
her 0 44 18
“intent,” 0 44 18
Horowitz 0 44 18
said 0 44 18
it 0 44 18
arose 0 44 18
“months 0 44 18
earlier,” 0 44 18
maybe 0 44 18
in 0 44 18
2015, 0 44 18
though 0 44 18
he 0 44 18
couldn’t 0 44 18
be 0 44 18
sure. 0 44 18

King 0 44 19
said 0 44 19
President 0 44 19
Obama 0 44 19
had 0 44 19
suggested 0 44 19
the 0 44 19
“careless 0 44 19
but 0 44 19
not 0 44 19
intentional” 0 44 19
language 0 44 19
in 0 44 19
a 0 44 19
“60 0 44 19
Minutes” 0 44 19
appearance 0 44 19
in 0 44 19
October 0 44 19
of 0 44 19
2015. 0 44 19

And 0 44 20
King 0 44 20
had 0 44 20
observed 0 44 20
that 0 44 20
in 0 44 20
his 0 44 20
July 0 44 20
5, 0 44 20
2016 0 44 20
statement, 0 44 20
James 0 44 20
Comey 0 44 20
used 0 44 20
“intent” 0 44 20
six 0 44 20
times. 0 44 20

Horowitz 0 44 21
said 0 44 21
Comey 0 44 21
“concealed 0 44 21
from 0 44 21
the 0 44 21

The 0 44 21

The 0 44 22

that 0 44 22

Horowitz 0 44 23
said 0 44 23
Strzok 0 44 23
and 0 44 23
Page 0 44 23
had 0 44 23
exchanged 0 44 23
“tens 0 44 23

texts.” 0 44 23
Ohio 0 44 23
Rep. 0 44 23
James 0 44 23
Jordan 0 44 23
asked 0 44 23
Horowitz 0 44 23
when 0 44 23
his 0 44 23
team 0 44 23
had 0 44 23
discovered 0 44 23
the 0 44 23
message 0 44 23
about 0 44 23
“we’ll 0 44 23
stop” 0 44 23
Trump. 0 44 23

Horowitz 0 44 24
conceded 0 44 24
that 0 44 24
this 0 44 24
meant 0 44 24
“stop 0 44 24
Trump 0 44 24
from 0 44 24
becoming 0 44 24
president.” 0 44 24
The 0 44 24
IG 0 44 24
said 0 44 24
they 0 44 24
uncovered 0 44 24
that 0 44 24
text 0 44 24
in 0 44 24
May, 0 44 24
and 0 44 24
Jordan 0 44 24
asked 0 44 24
“why 0 44 24
did 0 44 24
we 0 44 24
not 0 44 24
see 0 44 24
it 0 44 24
until 0 44 24
last 0 44 24
Thursday?” 0 44 24

“I 0 44 25
can’t 0 44 25
answer 0 44 25
that,” 0 44 25
Horowitz 0 44 25
said, 0 44 25
adding 0 44 25
that 0 44 25
it 0 44 25
had 0 44 25
been 0 44 25
sent 0 44 25
to 0 44 25
Rod 0 44 25
Rosenstein’s 0 44 25
department 0 44 25
at 0 44 25
the 0 44 25
DOJ. 0 44 25

Jordan 0 44 26
concluded 0 44 26
that 0 44 26
Rosenstein 0 44 26
“made 0 44 26
the 0 44 26
decision 0 44 26
that 0 44 26
we 0 44 26
had 0 44 26
to 0 44 26
wait 0 44 26
a 0 44 26
month.” 0 44 26

Several 0 44 27
representatives 0 44 27
were 0 44 27
curious 0 44 27
about 0 44 27
two 0 44 27
FBI 0 44 27
agents 0 44 27
and 0 44 27
one 0 44 27
lawyer 0 44 27
the 0 44 27
IG 0 44 27
report 0 44 27
had 0 44 27
not 0 44 27
named. 0 44 27

“The 0 44 28
FBI 0 44 28
raised 0 44 28
a 0 44 28
concern 0 44 28
because 0 44 28
they 0 44 28
work 0 44 28
on 0 44 28

matters,” 0 44 28
Horowitz 0 44 28
said. 0 44 28

Rep 0 44 29
Mark 0 44 29
Meadows 0 44 29
asked 0 44 29
if 0 44 29
the 0 44 29
two 0 44 29
FBI 0 44 29
agents 0 44 29
were 0 44 29
Kevin 0 44 29

Sally 0 44 29
Moyer, 0 44 29
which 0 44 29
the 0 44 29
IG 0 44 29
declined 0 44 29
to 0 44 29
confirm. 0 44 29

“They 0 44 30
don’t 0 44 30
work 0 44 30
in 0 44 30
counterintelligence,” 0 44 30
said 0 44 30
Meadows, 0 44 30
who 0 44 30
charged 0 44 30
that 0 44 30
the 0 44 30
FBI 0 44 30
gave 0 44 30
the 0 44 30
IG 0 44 30
“false 0 44 30
information” 0 44 30
and 0 44 30
altered 0 44 30
key 0 44 30
witness 0 44 30
reports. 0 44 30

“How 0 44 31
did 0 44 31

see 0 44 31
the 0 44 31
report 0 44 31
before 0 44 31
it 0 44 31
came 0 44 31
out?” 0 44 31
Rep. 0 44 31
Darrell 0 44 31
Issa 0 44 31
wanted 0 44 31
to 0 44 31
know. 0 44 31

Horowitz 0 44 32
said 0 44 32
Comey 0 44 32
didn’t 0 44 32
see 0 44 32
the 0 44 32
whole 0 44 32
thing, 0 44 32
but 0 44 32
explained 0 44 32
that 0 44 32
he 0 44 32
allowed 0 44 32
those 0 44 32
the 0 44 32
IG 0 44 32
team 0 44 32
had 0 44 32
criticized 0 44 32
to 0 44 32
have 0 44 32
a 0 44 32
look 0 44 32
before 0 44 32

By 0 44 33
the 0 44 33
end 0 44 33
of 0 44 33
the 0 44 33
day 0 44 33
it 0 44 33
was 0 44 33
evident 0 44 33
that 0 44 33
Congress 0 44 33
would 0 44 33
have 0 44 33
to 0 44 33
hear 0 44 33
from 0 44 33
Comey, 0 44 33
Rosenstein, 0 44 33
Strzok 0 44 33
and 0 44 33
others. 0 44 33

Horowitz 0 44 34
confirmed 0 44 34
that 0 44 34
the 0 44 34
IG 0 44 34
is 0 44 34
investigating 0 44 34
whether 0 44 34

official 0 44 34
Peter 0 44 34
Strzok’s 0 44 34
anti-Trump 0 44 34
bias 0 44 34
factored 0 44 34
into 0 44 34
the 0 44 34
launch 0 44 34
of 0 44 34
the 0 44 34
bureau’s 0 44 34
Russia 0 44 34

Also 0 44 35
on 0 44 35
Tuesday 0 44 35
Peter 0 44 35
Strzok 0 44 35
was 0 44 35
“escorted” 0 44 35
from 0 44 35
the 0 44 35
FBI 0 44 35
building. 0 44 35

As 0 44 36
his 0 44 36
lawyer 0 44 36
told 0 44 36
reporters, 0 44 36
Strzok 0 44 36
had 0 44 36
“played 0 44 36
by 0 44 36
the 0 44 36
rules,” 0 44 36
but 0 44 36
been 0 44 36
targeted 0 44 36
by 0 44 36
“unfounded 0 44 36
personal 0 44 36

political 0 44 36
games 0 44 36

“I 0 44 37
hope 0 44 37
he 0 44 37
comes 0 44 37
and 0 44 37
portrays 0 44 37
himself 0 44 37
as 0 44 37
a 0 44 37
victim,” 0 44 37

Fox 0 44 37

Rep. 0 44 38
Bob 0 44 38
Goodlatte 0 44 38
said 0 44 38
the 0 44 38

The 0 48 8
Pope’s 0 48 8

that 0 48 8
he 0 48 8
had 0 48 8
never 0 48 8

that 0 48 10

it 0 48 10
is 0 48 10
also 0 48 10
now 0 48 10

appointed 0 48 10

Karadima 0 48 14
and 0 48 14
Bishop 0 48 14
Juan 0 48 14
Barros 0 48 14
“a 0 48 14
scandal 1 48 14
of 1 48 14
epic 1 48 14
proportions.” 1 48 14

The 0 48 15
scandal 0 48 15
signals 0 48 15
that 0 48 15
the 0 48 15
Church 0 48 15
under 0 48 15
Francis 0 48 15
is 0 48 15
slipping 0 48 15
backwards 0 48 15
in 0 48 15
its 0 48 15
handling 0 48 15
of 0 48 15
abuse, 0 48 15
said 0 48 15
Yore. 0 48 15

Yore 0 48 16
called 0 48 16
the 0 48 16
example 0 48 16
Pope 0 48 16
Francis 0 48 16
set 0 48 16
in 0 48 16
the 0 48 16
way 0 48 16
he 0 48 16
handled 0 48 16
the 0 48 16
abuse 0 48 16
information 0 48 16
“extremely 0 48 16
dangerous.” 0 48 16

“But 0 48 17
it 0 48 17
is 0 48 17
extremely 1 48 17
dangerous 1 48 17
as 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
head 0 48 17
of 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
Catholic 0 48 17
Church 0 48 17
— 0 48 17
you 0 48 17
know, 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
last 0 48 17
appeal 0 48 17
— 0 48 17
that 0 48 17
this 0 48 17
is 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
kind 0 48 17
of 0 48 17
behavior 0 48 17
that 0 48 17
is 0 48 17
going 0 48 17
to 0 48 17
be 0 48 17
mimicked 0 48 17
around 0 48 17
the 0 48 17
world 0 48 17
by 0 48 17
bishops, 0 48 17
[who 0 48 17
will 0 48 17
say] 0 48 17
‘Well 1 48 17
if 1 48 17
the 1 48 17
Pope 1 48 17
is 1 48 17
not 1 48 17
going 1 48 17
to 1 48 17
intervene 1 48 17
and 1 48 17
impose 1 48 17
zero 1 48 17
tolerance, 1 48 17
why 1 48 17
should 1 48 17
I?’” 0 48 17

Reports 0 48 18
say 0 48 18
Pope 0 48 18
Francis 0 48 18
personally 0 48 18
received 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
eight-page 0 48 18
letter 0 48 18
from 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
Chilean 0 48 18
victim 0 48 18
graphically 0 48 18
detailing 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
alleged 0 48 18
abuses 0 48 18
by 0 48 18
Karadima 0 48 18
and 0 48 18
linking 0 48 18
Barros 0 48 18
as 0 48 18

witnessed 0 48 18
and 0 48 18
covered 0 48 18
up 0 48 18
the 0 48 18
abuse. 0 48 18

The 0 48 19
alleged 0 48 19
abuse 0 48 19
took 0 48 19
place 0 48 19
decades 0 48 19
prior 0 48 19
to 0 48 19
Francis’s 0 48 19
2015 0 48 19
appointment 0 48 19
of 0 48 19
Barros 0 48 19
to 0 48 19

Pope 0 48 20
Francis 0 48 20
received 0 48 20
the 0 48 20
victim’s 0 48 20
letter 0 48 20
in 0 48 20
2015, 0 48 20
its 0 48 20
author 0 48 20
and 0 48 20
a 0 48 20
member 0 48 20
of 0 48 20
Francis’s 0 48 20
sex 0 48 20
abuse 0 48 20
commission 0 48 20
have 0 48 20
said, 0 48 20
contradicting 0 48 20
the 0 48 20
Pope’s 0 48 20
recent 0 48 20
insistence 0 48 20
that 0 48 20
no 0 48 20
victims 0 48 20
had 0 48 20
come 0 48 20
forward 0 48 20
in 0 48 20
the 0 48 20
matter 0 48 20
and 0 48 20
no 0 48 20
evidence 0 48 20
had 0 48 20
been 0 48 20
produced. 0 48 20

Francis 0 48 21
encountered 0 48 21
protests 0 48 21
in 0 48 21
Chile 0 48 21
over 0 48 21
his 0 48 21
defense 0 48 21
of 0 48 21
Barros 0 48 21
during 0 48 21
his 0 48 21
visit 0 48 21
there 0 48 21
last 0 48 21
month, 0 48 21
calling 0 48 21
the 0 48 21
accusations 0 48 21
against 0 48 21
the 0 48 21
priest 0 48 21
“calumny.” 1 48 21

While 0 48 22
Francis 0 48 22
later 0 48 22
apologized, 0 48 22
he 0 48 22
persisted 0 48 22
in 0 48 22
defending 0 48 22
Barros, 0 48 22
denying 0 48 22
that 0 48 22
he 0 48 22
had 0 48 22
received 0 48 22
any 0 48 22
testimony 0 48 22
himself 0 48 22
and 0 48 22
restating 0 48 22
that 0 48 22
such 0 48 22
unproven 0 48 22
accusations 0 48 22
are 0 48 22
“slander.” 1 48 22

The 0 48 23
Pope 0 48 23
later 0 48 23
said 0 48 23
he 0 48 23
would 0 48 23
send 0 48 23
Malta 0 48 23
Archbishop 0 48 23
Charles 0 48 23
Scicluna 0 48 23
– 0 48 23
the 0 48 23
former 0 48 23
top 0 48 23
Vatican 0 48 23
abuse 0 48 23
investigator 0 48 23
- 0 48 23
to 0 48 23
Chile 0 48 23
to 0 48 23
investigate 0 48 23
the 0 48 23
matter. 0 48 23

Expectations 0 48 24
were 0 48 24
high 0 48 24
in 0 48 24
2014 0 48 24
when 0 48 24
the 0 48 24
Pope 0 48 24
created 0 48 24
the 0 48 24
abuse 0 48 24
commission. 0 48 24

And 0 48 25
while 0 48 25
he 0 48 25
has 0 48 25
continually 0 48 25
condemned 0 48 25
clergy 0 48 25
sex 0 48 25
abuse 0 48 25
throughout 0 48 25
his 0 48 25
pontificate, 0 48 25
some 0 48 25
have 0 48 25
argued 0 48 25
his 0 48 25
actions 0 48 25
in 0 48 25
some 0 48 25
serious 0 48 25
cases 0 48 25
don’t 0 48 25
match 0 48 25
his 0 48 25
tough 0 48 25
stances 0 48 25
on 0 48 25
abuse. 0 48 25

Four 0 48 26
members 0 48 26
of 0 48 26
the 0 48 26
commission 0 48 26
had 0 48 26
met 0 48 26
with 0 48 26
Cardinal 0 48 26
O’Malley 0 48 26
in 0 48 26
2015, 0 48 26
conveying 0 48 26
their 0 48 26
objections 0 48 26
to 0 48 26
Francis’s 0 48 26
2015 0 48 26
appointment 0 48 26
of 0 48 26
Barros 0 48 26
as 0 48 26
bishop 0 48 26
of 0 48 26
Osorno. 0 48 26

It 0 48 27
was 0 48 27
at 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
meeting 0 48 27
with 0 48 27
O’Malley 0 48 27
that 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
abuse 0 48 27
commission 0 48 27
representatives 0 48 27
reportedly 0 48 27
gave 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
letter 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
cardinal 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
deliver 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
Francis, 0 48 27
and 0 48 27
O’Malley 0 48 27
later 0 48 27
confirmed 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
a 0 48 27
commission 0 48 27
member 0 48 27
that 0 48 27
he 0 48 27
had 0 48 27
in 0 48 27
fact 0 48 27
personally 0 48 27
delivered 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
letter 0 48 27
to 0 48 27
the 0 48 27
Pope. 0 48 27

Yore 0 48 28
explained 0 48 28
that 0 48 28
the 0 48 28
Pope 0 48 28
has 0 48 28
been 0 48 28
told 0 48 28
from 0 48 28
the 0 48 28
moment 0 48 28
he 0 48 28
appointed 0 48 28
Barros 0 48 28
in 0 48 28
2015 0 48 28
that 0 48 28
it 0 48 28
was 0 48 28
a 0 48 28
bad 0 48 28
decision, 0 48 28
between 0 48 28
the 0 48 28
Chilean 0 48 28
bishops’ 0 48 28
conference, 0 48 28
petitions, 0 48 28
letters 0 48 28
and 0 48 28
calls, 0 48 28
that 0 48 28
were 0 48 28
all 0 48 28
ignored. 0 48 28

Further, 0 48 29
a 0 48 29
Chilean 0 48 29
judicial 0 48 29
inquiry 0 48 29
found 0 48 29
all 0 48 29
the 0 48 29
victims 0 48 29
who 0 48 29
testified 0 48 29
— 0 48 29
including 0 48 29
the 0 48 29
letter’s 0 48 29
author 0 48 29
Juan 0 48 29
Carlos 0 48 29
— 0 48 29
to 0 48 29
be 0 48 29
credible, 0 48 29
and 0 48 29
that 0 48 29
there 0 48 29
was 0 48 29
a 0 48 29
major 0 48 29
cover-up 0 48 29
of 0 48 29
the 0 48 29
abuse 0 48 29
by 0 48 29
Father 0 48 29
Karadima. 0 48 29

Arroyo 0 48 30
spoke 0 48 30
with 0 48 30
Cruz 0 48 30
as 0 48 30
well, 0 48 30
who 0 48 30
said 0 48 30
he 0 48 30
was 0 48 30
“incredibly 1 48 30
frustrated” 1 48 30
when 0 48 30
Barros 0 48 30
was 0 48 30
going 0 48 30
to 0 48 30
be 0 48 30
appointed. 0 48 30

He’d 0 48 31
testified 0 48 31
about 0 48 31
three 0 48 31
bishops 0 48 31
who 0 48 31
had 0 48 31
witnessed 0 48 31
abuse, 0 48 31
he 0 48 31
said, 0 48 31
but 0 48 31
Barros 0 48 31
had 0 48 31
special 0 48 31
significance 0 48 31
for 0 48 31
him 0 48 31
because 0 48 31
Barros’ 0 48 31
part 0 48 31
went 0 48 31
beyond 0 48 31
witnessing 0 48 31
the 0 48 31
abuse, 0 48 31
to 0 48 31
violating 1 48 31
his 1 48 31
seal 1 48 31
of 1 48 31
Confession 1 48 31
with 1 48 31
Karadima 1 48 31
and 0 48 31
psychological 0 48 31
abuse 0 48 31
through 0 48 31
intimidation. 0 48 31

Cruz 0 48 32
recounted 0 48 32
how 0 48 32
he 0 48 32
and 0 48 32
other 0 48 32
victims 0 48 32
had 0 48 32
been 0 48 32
dismissed 0 48 32
or 0 48 32
slandered 0 48 32
by 0 48 32
local 0 48 32
Church 0 48 32
hierarchy 0 48 32
for 0 48 32
numerous 0 48 32
attempts 0 48 32
to 0 48 32
be 0 48 32
heard. 0 48 32

And 0 48 33
he 0 48 33
spoke 0 48 33
about 0 48 33
holding 0 48 33
out 0 48 33
hope 0 48 33
that 0 48 33
there 0 48 33
would 0 48 33
be 0 48 33
a 0 48 33
different 0 48 33
response 0 48 33
from 0 48 33
the 0 48 33
Pope, 0 48 33
discussing 0 48 33
specifics 0 48 33
of 0 48 33
getting 0 48 33
the 0 48 33
letter 0 48 33
to 0 48 33
the 0 48 33
Francis 0 48 33
via 0 48 33
Cardinal 0 48 33
O’Malley. 0 48 33

Cruz 0 48 34
told 0 48 34
Arroyo 0 48 34
he 0 48 34
was 0 48 34
really 0 48 34
hurt 0 48 34
and 0 48 34
felt 0 48 34
betrayed 0 48 34
by 0 48 34
the 0 48 34
Pope’s 0 48 34
comments 0 48 34
that 0 48 34
the 0 48 34
accusations 0 48 34
were 0 48 34
slander, 0 48 34
and 0 48 34
there 0 48 34
were 0 48 34
no 0 48 34
witnesses 0 48 34
or 0 48 34
evidence. 0 48 34

“To 0 48 35
hear 0 48 35
him 0 48 35
talk 0 48 35
about 0 48 35
us 0 48 35
that 0 48 35
way,” 0 48 35
Cruz 0 48 35
said, 0 48 35
“calling 0 48 35
us 0 48 35
slanderers, 0 48 35
it 0 48 35
was 0 48 35
terrible 0 48 35
because 0 48 35
it 0 48 35
set 0 48 35
the 0 48 35
clock 0 48 35
back 0 48 35
for 0 48 35
so 0 48 35
many 0 48 35
victims.” 0 48 35

Scicluna 0 48 36
will 0 48 36
be 0 48 36
meeting 0 48 36
with 0 48 36
Cruz, 0 48 36
who 0 48 36
said 0 48 36
he 0 48 36
hopes 0 48 36
other 0 48 36
abuse 0 48 36
survivors 0 48 36
will 0 48 36
be 0 48 36
heard 0 48 36
as 0 48 36
a 0 48 36
result 0 48 36
of 0 48 36
his 0 48 36
case 0 48 36
coming 0 48 36
more 0 48 36
to 0 48 36
the 0 48 36
forefront. 0 48 36

“This 0 48 37
leaves 0 48 37
us 0 48 37
with 0 48 37
very 0 48 37
strong 0 48 37
evidence 0 48 37
that 0 48 37
the 0 48 37
Pope 0 48 37
was, 0 48 37
in 0 48 37
fact, 0 48 37
aware 0 48 37
of 0 48 37
what 0 48 37
has 0 48 37
happened,” 0 48 37
Yore 0 48 37
said. 0 48 37

“Here 0 48 38
we 0 48 38
have 0 48 38
victims 0 48 38
10, 0 48 38
15 0 48 38
years 0 48 38
after 0 48 38
their 0 48 38
abuse, 0 48 38
begging 1 48 38
the 1 48 38
Pope, 1 48 38
having 0 48 38
to 0 48 38
take 0 48 38
pictures 0 48 38
of 0 48 38
a 0 48 38
letter 0 48 38
that’s 0 48 38
handed 0 48 38
to 0 48 38
a 0 48 38
cardinal 0 48 38
to 0 48 38
ensure 0 48 38
that 0 48 38
there 0 48 38
is 0 48 38
evidence 0 48 38
that 0 48 38
the 0 48 38
Pope 0 48 38
is 0 48 38
receiving 0 48 38
this 0 48 38
information.” 0 48 38

The 1 48 39
whole 1 48 39
of 1 48 39
Latin 1 48 39
America, 1 48 39
including 1 48 39
Argentina, 1 48 39
was 1 48 39
well 1 48 39
aware 1 48 39
of 1 48 39
what 1 48 39
was 1 48 39
happening 1 48 39
when 0 48 39
this 0 48 39
case 0 48 39
broke 0 48 39
in 0 48 39
Chile 0 48 39
in 0 48 39
2010, 0 48 39
Yore 0 48 39
noted, 0 48 39
and 0 48 39
yet 0 48 39
the 0 48 39
Pope 0 48 39
continues 0 48 39
to 0 48 39
shrug 0 48 39
his 0 48 39
shoulders 0 48 39

no 0 48 39
information. 0 48 39

This 0 48 40
was 0 48 40
precisely 0 48 40
what 0 48 40
he’d 0 48 40
been 0 48 40
saying 0 48 40
when 0 48 40
he 0 48 40
was 0 48 40
cardinal 0 48 40
and 0 48 40
archbishop 0 48 40
in 0 48 40
Buenos 0 48 40
Aires, 0 48 40
she 0 48 40
said, 0 48 40
that 0 48 40
no 0 48 40
one 0 48 40
ever 0 48 40
came 0 48 40
forward 0 48 40
with 0 48 40
information, 0 48 40
and 0 48 40
there 1 48 40
were 1 48 40
never 1 48 40
any 1 48 40
cases 1 48 40
of 1 48 40
clerical 1 48 40
abuse 1 48 40
in 1 48 40
the 1 48 40
entirety 1 48 40
of 1 48 40
the 1 48 40
two-million-plus 1 48 40

“This 0 48 41
isn’t 0 48 41
just 0 48 41
simply 0 48 41
a 0 48 41
cover-up 0 48 41
of 0 48 41
a 0 48 41
predator 1 48 41
priest,” 1 48 41
Yore 0 48 41
stated. 0 48 41

“This 0 48 42
is 0 48 42
Barros 0 48 42
present, 0 48 42
in 0 48 42
the 0 48 42
room 0 48 42
when 0 48 42
the 0 48 42
abuse 0 48 42
is 0 48 42
ongoing 0 48 42
with 0 48 42
these 0 48 42
young 0 48 42
minor 0 48 42
boys.” 0 48 42

She 0 48 43
said 0 48 43
she 0 48 43
would 0 48 43
argue 0 48 43
as 0 48 43
a 0 48 43
child 0 48 43
advocate 0 48 43
that 0 48 43
Barros 0 48 43
was 0 48 43
involved 0 48 43
in 0 48 43
sexual 0 48 43
exploitation 0 48 43
of 0 48 43
children. 0 48 43

“So 0 48 44
I 0 48 44
don’t 0 48 44
think 0 48 44
this 0 48 44
is 0 48 44
simply 0 48 44
just 0 48 44
a 0 48 44
case, 0 48 44
as 0 48 44
bad 0 48 44
as 0 48 44
it 0 48 44
is, 0 48 44
of 0 48 44
a 0 48 44
cover-up 0 48 44
of 0 48 44
an 0 48 44
abuser,” 0 48 44
she 0 48 44
said. 0 48 44

“This 0 48 45
is 0 48 45
also 0 48 45
sexual 0 48 45
exploitation 0 48 45
of 0 48 45
children 0 48 45
in 0 48 45
a 1 48 45
grooming 1 48 45
gang, 1 48 45
a 1 48 45
predator 1 48 45
priest. 1 48 45

This 0 48 46
is 0 48 46
why 0 48 46
it 0 48 46
is 0 48 46
so 0 48 46
heinous.” 1 48 46

Yore 0 48 47
said 0 48 47
that 0 48 47
given 0 48 47
the 0 48 47
Church’s 0 48 47
sex 0 48 47
abuse 0 48 47
crisis, 0 48 47
one 0 48 47
would 0 48 47
have 0 48 47
thought 0 48 47
going 0 48 47
into 0 48 47
the 0 48 47
2013 0 48 47
conclave 0 48 47
(which 0 48 47
elected 0 48 47
Francis) 0 48 47
that 0 48 47
an 0 48 47
obvious 0 48 47
priority 0 48 47
in 0 48 47
vetting 0 48 47
candidates 0 48 47
for 0 48 47
the 0 48 47
papacy 0 48 47
would 0 48 47
have 0 48 47
meant 0 48 47
a 0 48 47
serious 0 48 47
look 0 48 47
at 0 48 47
their 0 48 47
history 0 48 47
of 0 48 47
handling 0 48 47
abuse 0 48 47
allegations 0 48 47
in 0 48 47
their 0 48 47
previous 0 48 47
sees. 0 48 47

There 0 48 48
are 0 48 48
more 0 48 48
cases 0 48 48
out 0 48 48
there 0 48 48
just 0 48 48
like 0 48 48
Barros 0 48 48
that 0 48 48
have 0 48 48
been 0 48 48
covered 0 48 48
up, 0 48 48
Yore 0 48 48
told 0 48 48
Arroyo, 0 48 48
maybe 0 48 48
even 0 48 48
some 0 48 48
even 0 48 48
worse 0 48 48
than 0 48 48
the 0 48 48
Barros 0 48 48
case. 0 48 48

“Those 0 48 49
cases 0 48 49
are 0 48 49
going 0 48 49
to 1 48 49
be 1 48 49
haunting 1 48 49
this 1 48 49
papacy 1 48 49
and 0 48 49
really 0 48 49
causing 0 48 49
a 0 48 49
rift 0 48 49
in 0 48 49
the 0 48 49
major 0 48 49
protection 0 48 49
of 0 48 49
children 0 48 49
that 0 48 49
Pope 0 48 49
Benedict 0 48 49
had 0 48 49
worked 0 48 49
very 0 48 49
hard 0 48 49
to 0 48 49
really 0 48 49
build 0 48 49
up,” 0 48 49
she 0 48 49
said. 0 48 49

“Trust 0 48 50
within 0 48 50
the 0 48 50

put 0 48 50

And 0 48 51
I 0 48 51
think 0 48 51
that 0 48 51
has 0 48 51
just 0 48 51

The 0 50 8
case 0 50 8
involves 0 50 8
Cody 0 50 8
Wilson, 0 50 8
founder 0 50 8
of 0 50 8
Defense 0 50 8
Distributed, 0 50 8
who 0 50 8
sued 0 50 8
the 0 50 8
government 0 50 8
in 0 50 8
2015 0 50 8
after 0 50 8
the 0 50 8
State 0 50 8
Department 0 50 8
under 0 50 8
the 0 50 8
Obama 0 50 8

governing 0 50 8
military 0 50 8

and 0 50 8

Mr. 0 50 9
Wilson, 0 50 9
an 1 50 9
avowed 1 50 9
anarchist 1 50 9
who 1 50 9
hopes 1 50 9
for 1 50 9
a 1 50 9
world 1 50 9
in 1 50 9
which 1 50 9
governments 1 50 9
can’t 1 50 9
stop 1 50 9
individuals 1 50 9
from 1 50 9
getting 1 50 9
guns, 1 50 9
claimed 0 50 9
his 0 50 9
First 0 50 9
Amendment 0 50 9
right 0 50 9
to 0 50 9
free 0 50 9
speech 0 50 9
was 0 50 9
being 0 50 9
violated. 0 50 9

But 0 50 10
he 0 50 10
lost 0 50 10
at 0 50 10
every 0 50 10
stage 0 50 10
of 0 50 10
litigation, 0 50 10
including 0 50 10
a 0 50 10
refusal 0 50 10
by 0 50 10
the 0 50 10
Supreme 0 50 10
Court 0 50 10
to 0 50 10
review 0 50 10
a 0 50 10
decision 0 50 10
that 0 50 10
the 0 50 10

So 1 50 11
it 1 50 11
was 1 50 11
stunning 1 50 11
— 0 50 11
but 1 50 11
not 1 50 11
surprising, 1 50 11
given 1 50 11
this 1 50 11

“What 1 52 3

the 1 52 11

JTA, 0 53 6
when 0 53 6
Tlaib 0 53 6
was 0 53 6
asked 0 53 6
if 0 53 6
she 0 53 6
would 0 53 6
vote 0 53 6
against 0 53 6
military 0 53 6
aid 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
Israel, 0 53 6
Tlaib 0 53 6
responded: 0 53 6
“Absolutely, 0 53 6
if 0 53 6
it 0 53 6
has 0 53 6
something 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
do 0 53 6
with 0 53 6
inequality 0 53 6
and 0 53 6
not 0 53 6
access 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
people 0 53 6
having 0 53 6
justice. 0 53 6

For 1 53 7
me, 1 53 7
U.S. 1 53 7
aid 1 53 7
should 1 53 7
be 1 53 7
leverage. 1 53 7

I 1 53 8
will 1 53 8
be 1 53 8
using 1 53 8
my 1 53 8
position 1 53 8
in 1 53 8
Congress 1 53 8
so 1 53 8
that 1 53 8
no 1 53 8
country, 1 53 8
not 1 53 8
one, 1 53 8
should 1 53 8
be 1 53 8
able 1 53 8
to 1 53 8
get 1 53 8
aid 1 53 8
from 1 53 8
the 1 53 8
U.S. 1 53 8
when 1 53 8
they 1 53 8
still 1 53 8
promote 1 53 8
that 1 53 8
kind 1 53 8
of 1 53 8
injustice.” 1 53 8

What 0 53 9
kind 0 53 9
of 0 53 9
injustice? 0 53 9

Tlaib, 1 53 10
of 1 53 10
course, 1 53 10
had 1 53 10
nothing 1 53 10
to 1 53 10
say 1 53 10
about 1 53 10
the 1 53 10
genocidal 1 53 10
incitement 1 53 10
against 1 53 10
Jews 1 53 10
and 1 53 10
Israel 1 53 10
that 1 53 10
regularly 1 53 10
features 1 53 10
on 1 53 10
Palestinian 1 53 10
television. 1 53 10

She 0 53 11
did 0 53 11
say, 0 53 11
however, 0 53 11
that 0 53 11
she 0 53 11
favors 0 53 11
a 0 53 11
one-state, 0 53 11
not 0 53 11
two-state, 0 53 11
“solution” 0 53 11
to 0 53 11
the 0 53 11
Israeli-Palestinian 0 53 11
conflict: 0 53 11
“One 0 53 11
state. 0 53 11

It 0 53 12
has 0 53 12
to 0 53 12
be 0 53 12
one 0 53 12
state. 0 53 12

Separate 0 53 13
but 0 53 13
equal 0 53 13
does 0 53 13
not 0 53 13
work. 0 53 13

I’m 0 53 14
only 0 53 14
42 0 53 14
years 0 53 14
old 0 53 14
but 0 53 14
my 0 53 14
teachers 0 53 14
were 0 53 14
of 0 53 14
that 0 53 14
generation 0 53 14
that 0 53 14
marched 0 53 14
with 0 53 14
Martin 0 53 14
Luther 0 53 14
King. 0 53 14

This 0 53 15
whole 0 53 15
idea 0 53 15
of 0 53 15
a 0 53 15
two-state 0 53 15
solution, 0 53 15
it 1 53 15
doesn’t 1 53 15
work.” 1 53 15

Indeed 0 53 16
it 0 53 16
doesn’t. 0 53 16

A 0 53 17
Palestinian 0 53 17
state 0 53 17
would 0 53 17
be 0 53 17
a 0 53 17
new 0 53 17
base 0 53 17
for 0 53 17
renewed 0 53 17
jihad 0 53 17
attacks 0 53 17
against 0 53 17
Israel. 0 53 17

But 0 53 18
a 0 53 18
“one-state 0 53 18
solution” 0 53 18
would 0 53 18
be 0 53 18
even 0 53 18
worse, 0 53 18
unless 0 53 18
that 0 53 18
state 0 53 18
is 0 53 18
the 0 53 18
current 0 53 18
State 0 53 18
of 0 53 18
Israel, 0 53 18
but 0 53 18
that 0 53 18
is 0 53 18
not 0 53 18
the 0 53 18
one 0 53 18
state 0 53 18
Tlaib 0 53 18
has 0 53 18
in 0 53 18
mind. 0 53 18

She 0 53 19
is 0 53 19
calling 0 53 19
for 0 53 19
an 0 53 19
Israeli/Palestinian 0 53 19
state 0 53 19
that 0 53 19
would 0 53 19
not 0 53 19
be 0 53 19
a 0 53 19
Jewish 0 53 19
State 0 53 19
or 0 53 19
a 0 53 19
homeland 0 53 19
for 0 53 19
the 0 53 19
Jewish 0 53 19
people, 0 53 19
but 0 53 19
a 0 53 19
federation 0 53 19
in 0 53 19
which 0 53 19
Palestinians 0 53 19
would 0 53 19
soon 0 53 19
overwhelm 0 53 19
Jews 0 53 19
demographically. 0 53 19

Progressive 0 53 20
denial 0 53 20
of 0 53 20
their 0 53 20
rights 0 53 20
would 0 53 20
soon 0 53 20
follow: 0 53 20
as 0 53 20
I 0 53 20
show 0 53 20
in 0 53 20
my 0 53 20
book 0 53 20
The 0 53 20
History 0 53 20
of 0 53 20
Jihad 0 53 20
From 0 53 20
Muhammad 0 53 20
to 0 53 20
ISIS, 0 53 20
there 0 53 20
has 0 53 20
never 0 53 20
been 0 53 20
a 0 53 20
majority 0 53 20
Muslim 0 53 20
nation 0 53 20
in 0 53 20
which 0 53 20
Jews 0 53 20
enjoyed 0 53 20
equality 0 53 20
of 0 53 20
rights 0 53 20
with 0 53 20
Muslims. 0 53 20

Tlaib’s 0 53 21
unitary 0 53 21
state 0 53 21
would 0 53 21
be 0 53 21
no 0 53 21
different. 0 53 21

The 0 53 22
hijabed 0 53 22
(and 0 53 22
therefore 0 53 22
pro-Sharia) 0 53 22
Ilhan 0 53 22
Omar, 0 53 22
meanwhile, 0 53 22
is 1 53 22
even 1 53 22
more 1 53 22
hateful 1 53 22
than 1 53 22
Tlaib. 1 53 22

According 0 53 23
to 0 53 23
the 0 53 23
Daily 0 53 23
Wire, 0 53 23
in 0 53 23
2012 0 53 23
Omar 0 53 23
tweeted: 0 53 23
“Israel 0 53 23

Challenged 0 53 24
about 0 53 24
this 0 53 24
tweet 0 53 24
much 0 53 24
more 0 53 24
recently, 0 53 24
she 1 53 24
doubled 1 53 24
down 1 53 24
and 1 53 24
attacked 1 53 24
the 0 53 24
man 0 53 24
who 0 53 24
called 0 53 24
attention 0 53 24
to 0 53 24
the 0 53 24
tweet: 0 53 24
“Drawing 0 53 24

to 0 53 24
the 0 53 24

regime 0 53 24
is 0 53 24
far 0 53 24
from 0 53 24
hating 0 53 24
Jews. 0 53 24

You 1 53 25
are 1 53 25
a 1 53 25
hateful 1 53 25
sad 1 53 25
man, 1 53 25
I 1 53 25
pray 1 53 25
to 1 53 25
Allah 1 53 25
you 1 53 25
get 1 53 25
the 1 53 25

you 1 53 25
need 1 53 25
and 1 53 25
find 1 53 25
happiness.” 1 53 25

There 1 53 26
is 1 53 26
much, 1 53 26
much 1 53 26
worse 1 53 26
about 1 53 26
Omar. 1 53 26

David 0 53 27
Steinberg 0 53 27
of 0 53 27
PJ 0 53 27
Media 0 53 27
has 0 53 27
done 0 53 27
extraordinary 1 53 27
work 1 53 27
in 0 53 27
shedding 0 53 27
light 0 53 27
on 0 53 27
aspects 0 53 27
of 0 53 27
Omar’s 0 53 27
record 0 53 27
that 0 53 27
the 0 53 27
establishment 0 53 27
media 0 53 27
has 0 53 27
steadfastly 1 53 27
ignored. 1 53 27

Steinberg 0 53 28
reports 0 53 28
that 0 53 28
Omar 0 53 28
has 0 53 28
“faced 0 53 28
allegations 0 53 28
-- 0 53 28
soon 0 53 28
backed 0 53 28
by 0 53 28
a 0 53 28
remarkable 0 53 28
amount 0 53 28
of 0 53 28
evidence 0 53 28
-- 0 53 28
that 0 53 28
she 0 53 28
had 0 53 28
married 0 53 28
her 0 53 28
own 0 53 28
brother 0 53 28
in 0 53 28
2009, 0 53 28
and 0 53 28
was 0 53 28
still 0 53 28
legally 0 53 28
his 0 53 28
wife. 0 53 28

They 0 53 29
officially 0 53 29
divorced 0 53 29
in 0 53 29
December 0 53 29
2017. 0 53 29

The 0 53 30
motivation 0 53 30
for 0 53 30
the 0 53 30
marriage 0 53 30
remains 0 53 30
unclear. 0 53 30

However, 0 53 31
the 0 53 31
totality 0 53 31
of 0 53 31
the 0 53 31
evidence 0 53 31
points 0 53 31
to 0 53 31
possible 0 53 31
immigration 0 53 31
fraud 0 53 31
and 0 53 31
student 0 53 31
loan 0 53 31
fraud.” 0 53 31
What’s 0 53 31
more, 0 53 31
she 0 53 31
swore 0 53 31
to 0 53 31
apparent 0 53 31
falsehoods 0 53 31
in 0 53 31
court. 0 53 31

But 0 53 32
Leftists 0 53 32
rarely 0 53 32
have 0 53 32
to 0 53 32
answer 0 53 32
for 0 53 32
their 0 53 32
corruption, 0 53 32
and 0 53 32
in 0 53 32
a 0 53 32
Democrat 0 53 32
House, 0 53 32
Omar 0 53 32
will 0 53 32
much 0 53 32
more 0 53 32
likely 0 53 32
be 0 53 32
celebrated 0 53 32
than 0 53 32
investigated. 0 53 32

She 0 53 33
and 0 53 33
Tlaib 0 53 33
will 0 53 33
enjoy 0 53 33
establishment 0 53 33
media 0 53 33
accolades 0 53 33
as 0 53 33
they 0 53 33
pursue 0 53 33
their 0 53 33
hard-Left, 0 53 33
anti-American, 0 53 33
anti-Israel 0 53 33
agenda. 0 53 33

Their 0 53 34
presence 0 53 34
in 0 53 34
the 0 53 34
House 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
Representatives 0 53 34
may 0 53 34
be 0 53 34
evidence 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
“diversity,” 0 53 34
but 0 53 34
it 0 53 34
is 0 53 34
also 0 53 34
a 0 53 34
disquieting 0 53 34
sign 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
the 0 53 34
continued 0 53 34
dominance 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
identity 0 53 34
politics, 0 53 34
and 0 53 34
the 1 53 34
increasing 1 53 34
balkanization 1 53 34
of 0 53 34
the 0 53 34
American 0 53 34
body 0 53 34
politic. 0 53 34

Forthrightly 1 53 35
pro-America, 1 53 35
pro-Israel 1 53 35
candidates 1 53 35
would 1 53 35
stand 1 53 35
little 1 53 35
to 1 53 35
no 1 53 35
chance 1 53 35
in 1 53 35
either 1 53 35
of 1 53 35
their 1 53 35
districts. 1 53 35

And 1 53 36
that 1 53 36
is 1 53 36
indicative 1 53 36
of 1 53 36
a 1 53 36
much 1 53 36
larger 1 53 36
problem. 1 53 36

America's 0 63 0
Immigration 0 63 0
Voice. 0 63 0

Kritarch 1 63 1
Patti 1 63 1
Saris 1 63 1
thinks 1 63 1
she 1 63 1
runs 1 63 1
immigration 1 63 1
policy, 1 63 1
right 0 63 1
down 0 63 1
to 0 63 1
how 0 63 1
many 0 63 1
times 0 63 1
someone 0 63 1
can 0 63 1
have 0 63 1
their 0 63 1
case 0 63 1
reviewed, 0 63 1
though 0 63 1
she 0 63 1
seems 0 63 1
confused 0 63 1
as 0 63 1
to 0 63 1
who 0 63 1
will 0 63 1
do 0 63 1
the 0 63 1
reviewing 0 63 1
of 0 63 1
those 0 63 1
cases. 0 63 1

At 0 63 2
issue 0 63 2
is 0 63 2
a 0 63 2
large 0 63 2
group 0 63 2
of 0 63 2
Indonesian 0 63 2
Chinese 0 63 2
Christians 0 63 2
who 0 63 2
fled 0 63 2
a 0 63 2
pogrom 1 63 2
in 0 63 2
Indonesia 0 63 2
directed 0 63 2
against 0 63 2
them 0 63 2
in 0 63 2
the 0 63 2
1990s. 0 63 2

The 0 63 3
Chinese 0 63 3
generally 0 63 3
filed 0 63 3
asylum 0 63 3
applications 0 63 3
after 0 63 3
arriving 0 63 3
in 0 63 3
the 0 63 3
United 0 63 3
States, 0 63 3
and, 0 63 3
importantly, 0 63 3
not 0 63 3
at 0 63 3
an 0 63 3
American 0 63 3
embassy 0 63 3
or 0 63 3
consulate 0 63 3
in 0 63 3
Indonesia 0 63 3
or 0 63 3
nearby. 0 63 3

All 0 63 4
were 0 63 4
relatively 0 63 4
wealthy 0 63 4
and 0 63 4
had 0 63 4
or 0 63 4
obtained 0 63 4
tourist 0 63 4
visas 0 63 4
to 0 63 4
the 0 63 4
United 0 63 4
States. 0 63 4

This 0 63 5
is 0 63 5
important 0 63 5
as 0 63 5
most 0 63 5
actual 0 63 5
"refugees" 0 63 5
drop 0 63 5
everything 0 63 5
to 0 63 5
flee 0 63 5
their 0 63 5
homelands 0 63 5
if 0 63 5
they 0 63 5
are 0 63 5
under 0 63 5
threat 0 63 5
of 0 63 5
death. 0 63 5

Tellingly, 1 63 6
these 1 63 6
asylum 1 63 6
applicants 1 63 6
were 1 63 6
the 1 63 6
elite 1 63 6
of 1 63 6
Indonesian 1 63 6
society, 1 63 6
because 1 63 6
their 1 63 6
higher 1 63 6
average 1 63 6
IQ, 1 63 6
than 1 63 6
the 1 63 6
rather 1 63 6
dull 1 63 6
Indonesians. 1 63 6

87 0 63 7
is 0 63 7
the 0 63 7
average 0 63 7
Indonesian 0 63 7
IQ 0 63 7
, 0 63 7
and 0 63 7
note 0 63 7
that 0 63 7
average 0 63 7
includes 0 63 7
the 0 63 7
higher 0 63 7
average 0 63 7
Chinese, 0 63 7
so 1 63 7
the 1 63 7
locals 1 63 7
really 1 63 7
are 1 63 7
a 1 63 7
dull 1 63 7
lot. 1 63 7

This 0 63 8
is 0 63 8
important 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
that 0 63 8
while 0 63 8
there 0 63 8
was 0 63 8
anti-Chinese 0 63 8
and 0 63 8
anti-Christian 0 63 8

In 0 63 9
any 0 63 9

the 0 63 9

was 0 63 9
limited 0 63 9
in 0 63 9

and 0 63 9
duration 0 63 9
as 0 63 9

they 0 63 9

In 0 63 10
the 0 63 10
United 0 63 10
States, 0 63 10
these 0 63 10
Chinese 0 63 10
went 0 63 10
through 0 63 10
the 0 63 10
liberal 0 63 10
asylum 0 63 10
process, 0 63 10
but 0 63 10
did 0 63 10
not 0 63 10
manage 0 63 10
to 0 63 10
fool 1 63 10
even 1 63 10
the 1 63 10
credulous 1 63 10

at 0 63 10

Review 0 63 10
(EOIR), 0 63 10
the 0 63 10

courts. 0 63 10

Fast 0 63 11
forward 0 63 11
to 0 63 11
the 0 63 11
Obama 0 63 11
Regime 0 63 11
Administrative 0 63 11
Amnesty 0 63 11
, 0 63 11
where 0 63 11
despite 0 63 11
outstanding 0 63 11
deportation 0 63 11
orders, 0 63 11
these 0 63 11
illegal 0 63 11
aliens, 0 63 11
among 0 63 11
millions 0 63 11
of 0 63 11
others, 0 63 11
are 0 63 11
allowed 0 63 11
to 0 63 11
remain, 0 63 11
and 0 63 11
then 0 63 11
given 0 63 11
employment 0 63 11
authorization 0 63 11
as 0 63 11
well. 0 63 11

Fortunately, 1 63 12
elections 1 63 12
have 1 63 12
consequences, 1 63 12
and 1 63 12
the 1 63 12
Obama 1 63 12
Regime 1 63 12
Administrative 1 63 12
Amnesty, 1 63 12
or 1 63 12
parts 1 63 12
of 1 63 12
it, 1 63 12
came 1 63 12
to 1 63 12
an 1 63 12
inglorious 1 63 12
end. 1 63 12

And 0 63 13
end 0 63 13
it 0 63 13
was 0 63 13
for 0 63 13
this 0 63 13
particular 0 63 13
lot 0 63 13
of 0 63 13
illegal 0 63 13
aliens. 0 63 13

But 0 63 14
Kritarch 0 63 14
Patti 0 63 14
Saris 0 63 14
was 0 63 14
having 0 63 14
none 0 63 14
of 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
immigration 0 63 14
laws 0 63 14
of 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
United 0 63 14
States. 0 63 14

She 0 63 15
thought 0 63 15
she 0 63 15
was 0 63 15
decider-in-chief 1 63 15
on 1 63 15
who 1 63 15
gets 1 63 15
deported. 1 63 15

And 0 63 16
all 0 63 16
on 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
flimsy 0 63 16
excuse 0 63 16
that 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
aliens 1 63 16
need 0 63 16
another 1 63 16
bite 1 63 16
at 1 63 16
the 1 63 16
apple, 1 63 16
despite 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
clear 0 63 16
fact 0 63 16
that 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
Indonesian 0 63 16
government 0 63 16
had 0 63 16
long 0 63 16
ago 0 63 16
quashed 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
ethnic 0 63 16
riots 0 63 16
directed 0 63 16
against 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
market 0 63 16
dominant 0 63 16
minority 0 63 16
of 0 63 16
Chinese 0 63 16
and 0 63 16
the 0 63 16
religious 0 63 16
motivated 0 63 16
violence 0 63 16
against 0 63 16
Christians. 0 63 16

While 0 63 17
there 0 63 17
are 0 63 17
a 0 63 17
couple 0 63 17
of 0 63 17
provinces 0 63 17
in 0 63 17
Indonesia 0 63 17
that 0 63 17
impose 0 63 17
Sharia 0 63 17
law 0 63 17
on 0 63 17
Muslims, 0 63 17
most 0 63 17
non-Muslims 0 63 17
are 0 63 17
exempt. 0 63 17

As 0 63 18
moderates 0 63 18
go, 0 63 18
Indonesia 0 63 18
is 0 63 18
about 0 63 18
as 0 63 18
close 0 63 18
as 0 63 18
it 0 63 18
gets 0 63 18
to 0 63 18
moderate 0 63 18
Muslims. 0 63 18

Mostly 0 63 19
because 0 63 19
the 1 63 19
country 1 63 19
would 1 63 19
not 1 63 19
last 1 63 19
long 1 63 19
without 1 63 19
an 1 63 19
outside 1 63 19
high 1 63 19
IQ 1 63 19
elite 1 63 19
to 1 63 19
run 1 63 19
the 1 63 19
country. 1 63 19

Before 0 63 20
it 0 63 20
was 0 63 20
the 0 63 20
high 0 63 20
IQ 0 63 20
Dutch, 0 63 20
now 0 63 20
it's 0 63 20
the 0 63 20
Chinese. 0 63 20

Remember, 0 63 21
an 1 63 21
87 1 63 21
IQ 1 63 21
is 1 63 21
just 1 63 21
about 1 63 21
retarded. 1 63 21

have 0 63 23
a 0 63 23
chance 0 63 23

that 0 63 23
conditions 0 63 23
in 0 63 23
their 0 63 23
home 0 63 23
country 0 63 23
had 0 63 23
deteriorated 0 63 23

enough 0 63 23

without 0 63 24
the 0 63 24

at 0 63 24
which 0 63 24
time 0 63 24
they 0 63 24

Saris 0 63 26
thought 0 63 26
she 0 63 26
knew 0 63 26
better 0 63 26
and 0 63 26
has 0 63 26
been 0 63 26
running 0 63 26

And 0 63 27
now 0 63 27
she 1 63 27
has 1 63 27
gone 1 63 27
full 1 63 27

their 0 63 30

avail 0 63 30
them 0 63 30
of 0 63 30
another 0 63 30

Indonesia 0 63 31
is 0 63 31
more 0 63 31
hospitable 0 63 31
to 0 63 31
Chinese 0 63 31
Christians 0 63 31
today 0 63 31
than 0 63 31
the 0 63 31
short 0 63 31
period 0 63 31
in 0 63 31
the 0 63 31
90s 0 63 31
when 0 63 31
there 0 63 31
was 0 63 31
a 0 63 31
problem. 0 63 31

But 0 63 32
basically, 0 63 32
Saris 0 63 32
wants 0 63 32
the 0 63 32
illegal 1 63 32
aliens 1 63 32
the 0 63 32
opportunity 0 63 32
to 0 63 32
submit 0 63 32
another 0 63 32

and 0 63 32
benefit 0 63 32
by 0 63 32
the 0 63 32
years 0 63 32
it 0 63 32
will 0 63 32
take 0 63 32
to 0 63 32
adjudicate 0 63 32
those 0 63 32
claims. 0 63 32

Basically 0 63 33
Saris 0 63 33
wants 0 63 33
these 0 63 33
illegals 0 63 33
to 0 63 33
never 0 63 33
leave. 0 63 33

That, 0 63 34
of 0 63 34
course 0 63 34
is 0 63 34
not 0 63 34
her 0 63 34
role. 0 63 34

The 0 63 35
only 0 63 35
claim 0 63 35
they 0 63 35
have 0 63 35
before 0 63 35
a 0 63 35
Federal 0 63 35
court 0 63 35
is 0 63 35
if 0 63 35
they 0 63 35
got 0 63 35
the 0 63 35
due 0 63 35
process 0 63 35
that 0 63 35
Congress 0 63 35
gave 0 63 35
those 0 63 35
illegal 1 63 35
aliens. 1 63 35

And 0 63 36
they 0 63 36
did, 0 63 36
they 0 63 36
filed 0 63 36
for 0 63 36
asylum, 0 63 36
had 0 63 36
a 0 63 36
hearing 0 63 36
and 0 63 36
appeals, 0 63 36
and 0 63 36
lost. 0 63 36

With 0 63 37
the 0 63 37
legislative 0 63 37
fight 0 63 37
over 0 63 37
DACA, 0 63 37
the 0 63 37
Trump 0 63 37
Administration 0 63 37
needs 0 63 37
to 0 63 37
include 0 63 37
legislative 0 63 37

including 0 63 37
more 0 63 37

to 0 68 45

the 0 68 45

on 0 68 45
interpretation 0 68 45

contract 0 68 45

After 0 68 46
court, 0 68 46
Hadeed 0 68 46
told 0 68 46
reporters 0 68 46
Bacon 0 68 46
had 0 68 46
threatened 0 68 46
to 0 68 46
sue 0 68 46
him 0 68 46
for 0 68 46
defamation. 0 68 46

“I 0 68 47
don’t 0 68 47

that,” 0 68 47

outside 0 68 47
court. 0 68 47

“I 0 68 48

In 0 68 49
court, 0 68 49
Bacon 0 68 49
badgered 0 68 49
Hadeed. 0 68 49

“Are 0 68 50
you 0 68 50

not. 0 68 51

I 0 68 52
hope 0 68 52
you 0 68 52
learned 0 68 52
that 0 68 52
lesson,” 0 68 52
he 0 68 52
said. 0 68 52

“You 1 68 53
have 1 68 53
no 1 68 53
control 1 68 53
over 1 68 53

do 1 68 53
you? 1 68 53

You’re 0 68 54
like, 0 68 54
talking 1 68 54
to 1 68 54
a 1 68 54
wall,” 1 68 54
he 0 68 54
said 0 68 54
of 0 68 54
Gilani. 0 68 54

Hadeed 0 68 55
said 0 68 55
three 0 68 55
different 0 68 55
signatures 0 68 55
from 0 68 55
Abid 0 68 55
on 0 68 55
financial 0 68 55
documents 0 68 55
did 0 68 55
not 0 68 55
match, 0 68 55
and 0 68 55
put 0 68 55
a 0 68 55
defiant 0 68 55
Abid 0 68 55
on 0 68 55
the 0 68 55
witness 0 68 55
stand. 0 68 55

Hadeed: 0 68 56
Why 1 68 56
do 1 68 56
your 1 68 56
signatures 1 68 56
look 1 68 56
different? 1 68 56

Abid: 0 68 57
My 0 68 57
signatures 0 68 57
are 0 68 57
not 0 68 57
very 0 68 57
consistent, 0 68 57
I’m 1 68 57
just 1 68 57
a 1 68 57
human 1 68 57
being… 1 68 57

Hadeed: 0 68 58
You 0 68 58
were 0 68 58
aware 0 68 58
you 0 68 58
were 0 68 58
changing 0 68 58
beneficiary 0 68 58
from 0 68 58
your 0 68 58
father’s 0 68 58
spouse 0 68 58
to 0 68 58
yourself? 0 68 58

Abid: 0 68 59
That 0 68 59
was 0 68 59
my 0 68 59
father’s 0 68 59
request… 0 68 59

Hadeed: 0 68 60
You’re 0 68 60
not 0 68 60
answering 0 68 60
the 0 68 60
question. 0 68 60

Abid: 0 68 61
I’m 0 68 61
not 0 68 61
very 0 68 61
smart, 0 68 61
so 0 68 61
it 0 68 61
takes 0 68 61
a 0 68 61
while 0 68 61
sometimes… 0 68 61

Judge: 0 68 62
I 1 68 62
don’t 1 68 62
understand 1 68 62
why 1 68 62
the 1 68 62
witness 1 68 62
is 1 68 62
having 1 68 62
such 1 68 62
trouble 1 68 62
with 1 68 62
the 1 68 62
question. 1 68 62

Your 0 68 63
job 0 68 63
is 0 68 63
to 0 68 63
answer 0 68 63
the 0 68 63
question. 0 68 63

In 0 68 64
court 0 68 64
documents, 0 68 64
Gilani 0 68 64
alleged, 0 68 64
“while 0 68 64
he 0 68 64
was 0 68 64
admitted 0 68 64
in 0 68 64

my 0 68 64

some 0 68 64
other 0 68 64

were 0 68 64
also 0 68 64
installed/planted 0 68 64
in 0 68 64
my 0 68 64
house 0 68 64
… 0 68 64
Imran 0 68 64
Awan 0 68 64
showed 0 68 64
up 0 68 64
and 0 68 64
threatened 0 68 64
me 0 68 64
for 0 68 64
me 0 68 64
calling 0 68 64
the 0 68 64
police. 0 68 64

[Imran] 0 68 65
threatened 1 68 65
that 1 68 65
he 1 68 65
is 1 68 65

if 1 68 65
I 1 68 65
ever 1 68 65
call 1 68 65
the 1 68 65
police 1 68 65
again 1 68 65
[he] 1 68 65
will 1 68 65
do 1 68 65
harm 1 68 65
to 1 68 65
me.” 1 68 65
She 0 68 65
said 0 68 65
that 0 68 65
Imran 0 68 65
eventually 0 68 65
agreed 0 68 65
to 0 68 65
remove 0 68 65
the 0 68 65
listening 0 68 65
devices 0 68 65
and 0 68 65
did 0 68 65
so 0 68 65
in 0 68 65
front 0 68 65
of 0 68 65
her. 0 68 65

Based 0 68 66
on 0 68 66
Hadeed’s 0 68 66
narrow 0 68 66
legal 0 68 66
argument 0 68 66
about 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
life 0 68 66
insurance 0 68 66
contract’s 0 68 66
language, 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
judge 0 68 66
ruled 0 68 66
that, 0 68 66
“The 0 68 66
son 0 68 66
as 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
owner 0 68 66
of 0 68 66
the 0 68 66

has 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
absolute 0 68 66
right 0 68 66
to 0 68 66
change 0 68 66
the 0 68 66
beneficiary.” 0 68 66

After 0 68 67
Gilani 0 68 67
retained 0 68 67
a 0 68 67
lawyer, 0 68 67
Bacon 0 68 67
had 0 68 67
offered 0 68 67
a 0 68 67
settlement 0 68 67
where 0 68 67
they’d 0 68 67
split 0 68 67
the 0 68 67
money, 0 68 67
but 0 68 67
Gilani 0 68 67
declined 0 68 67
it. 0 68 67

The 0 68 68
court 0 68 68
awarded 0 68 68
Abid 0 68 68
the 0 68 68
$50,000 0 68 68
life 0 68 68
insurance 0 68 68
payout, 0 68 68
minus 0 68 68
$5,000 0 68 68
that 0 68 68
the 0 68 68
insurance 0 68 68
company 0 68 68
took 0 68 68
for 0 68 68
its 0 68 68
expenses 0 68 68
in 0 68 68
litigating 0 68 68
the 0 68 68
fraud 0 68 68
allegations. 0 68 68

“You 0 68 69
should 0 68 69
have 0 68 69
taken 0 68 69
the 0 68 69
settlement. 0 68 69

Now 0 68 70
she’s 0 68 70
not 0 68 70
getting 0 68 70
a 0 68 70
penny,” 0 68 70
Bacon 0 68 70
said 0 68 70
in 0 68 70
court. 0 68 70

“You’re 0 68 71
not 0 68 71
getting 0 68 71
anything.” 0 68 71

Gilani 0 68 72
said 0 68 72
after 0 68 72
court 0 68 72
that 0 68 72
her 0 68 72
conscience 0 68 72
didn’t 0 68 72
allow 0 68 72
her 0 68 72
to 0 68 72
settle. 0 68 72

“I 0 68 73
didn’t 0 68 73
do 0 68 73
the 0 68 73

because 0 68 73
they 0 68 73

I 0 68 74
cannot 0 68 74
agree 0 68 74
to 0 68 74
that. 0 68 74

It 0 68 75

Botham 0 70 1
Jean 0 70 1
in 0 70 1
his 0 70 1
apartment 0 70 1
for 0 70 1
no 0 70 1
reason, 0 70 1
is 0 70 1
a 0 70 1
glaring 0 70 1
example 0 70 1
of 0 70 1
“blue 1 70 1

Guyger 0 70 2
claims 0 70 2
that 0 70 2
she 0 70 2
accidentally 0 70 2
entered 0 70 2
the 0 70 2
wrong 0 70 2
apartment 0 70 2
and 0 70 2
shot 0 70 2
a 0 70 2
man 0 70 2
who 0 70 2
she 0 70 2
thought 0 70 2
was 0 70 2
a 0 70 2
burglar, 0 70 2
however, 0 70 2
eyewitness 0 70 2
testimony 0 70 2
has 0 70 2
contradicted 0 70 2
her 0 70 2
initial 0 70 2
statement. 0 70 2

Despite 0 70 3
admitting 0 70 3
to 0 70 3
killing 0 70 3
an 0 70 3
innocent 1 70 3
man 0 70 3
and 0 70 3
having 0 70 3
her 0 70 3
initial 0 70 3
statement 0 70 3
contradicted 0 70 3
by 0 70 3
witness 0 70 3
testimony, 0 70 3
Guyger 0 70 3
has 0 70 3
been 0 70 3
treated 0 70 3
as 0 70 3
more 0 70 3
of 0 70 3
a 0 70 3
victim 0 70 3
than 0 70 3
a 0 70 3
killer. 0 70 3

In 0 70 4
fact, 0 70 4
Guyger’s 0 70 4
apartment 0 70 4
was 0 70 4
never 0 70 4
even 0 70 4
searched 0 70 4
for 0 70 4
evidence, 0 70 4
and 0 70 4
she 0 70 4
was 0 70 4
allowed 0 70 4
to 0 70 4
“vacate” 0 70 4
the 0 70 4

any 0 70 4

not 0 70 5
searching 0 70 5
her 0 70 5
apartment 0 70 5
immediately, 0 70 5
police 0 70 5
ruined 0 70 5

The 0 112 5

If 0 112 6

Barely 0 112 7
30, 0 112 7
Habib 0 112 7
Powell 0 112 7
had 0 112 7
more 0 112 7

know. 0 112 7

Then 0 112 8
she 0 112 8
took 0 112 8
on 0 112 8
the 0 112 8

And 0 112 19
Habib 0 112 19

Unlike 0 112 20
McFarland, 0 112 20
Habib 0 112 20

had 0 112 20
no 0 112 20

But 0 112 21
though 0 112 21
her 0 112 21
parents 0 112 21
were 0 112 21
Christians, 0 112 21
she 0 112 21

the 0 112 21
“right” 0 112 21

In 0 112 22
Egypt, 0 112 22
she 0 112 22

September 0 112 22

"I 0 112 22

Habib 0 112 23
Powell 0 112 23

And 0 112 24
she 0 112 24

saying 0 112 24
that 0 112 24
Abedin 0 112 24
“feels 0 112 24

And 0 112 25
Powell 0 112 25

In 0 112 27
2015, 0 112 27

In 0 112 28
that 0 112 28
interview, 0 112 28
Powell 0 112 28
heaped 0 112 28
effusive 0 112 28
praise 0 112 28
upon 0 112 28
Power 0 112 28

can 0 112 28
be 0 112 28
seen 0 112 28
nodding 0 112 28
in 0 112 28
agreement 0 112 28
throughout. 0 112 28

Power 0 112 29
was 0 112 29

senior 0 112 29
adviser 0 112 29
to 0 112 29
President 0 112 29

At 0 112 30
the 0 112 30
time, 0 112 30
Powell 0 112 30
– 0 112 30
an 0 112 30

Goldman 0 112 30

which 0 112 30
is 0 112 30
ostensibly 0 112 30
intended 0 112 30
to 0 112 30
foster 0 112 30
female 0 112 30

When 0 112 31

Perhaps 0 112 32
not 0 112 32
so 0 112 32
coincidentally, 0 112 32
Meyer 0 112 32
worked 0 112 32

Philippe 0 112 40

Now 0 112 41
there's 0 112 41
once 0 112 41
again 0 112 41
talk 0 112 41
of 0 112 41
moving 0 112 41
Dina 0 112 41
Powell 0 112 41
in. 0 112 41

This 0 112 42
time 0 112 42
into 0 112 42
Nikki 0 112 42
Halley's 0 112 42
old 0 112 42
spot 0 112 42
as 0 112 42
UN 0 112 42
Ambassador. 0 112 42

The 0 112 43
talk 0 112 43
comes 0 112 43
from 0 112 43
the 0 112 43
GOP 0 112 43
establishment. 0 112 43

Powell 0 112 44
should 0 112 44
not 0 112 44
be 0 112 44
at 0 112 44
the 0 112 44
NSC, 0 112 44
where 0 112 44
she 0 112 44
replaced 0 112 44
K.T. 0 112 44

McFarland, 0 112 45
who 0 112 45
was 0 112 45
qualified 0 112 45
for 0 112 45
the 0 112 45
job, 0 112 45
at 0 112 45
the 0 112 45
behest 0 112 45
of 0 112 45
H.R. 0 112 45

McMaster. 0 112 46

But 0 112 47
every 0 112 47
job 0 112 47
for 0 112 47
Powell 0 112 47
is 0 112 47
a 0 112 47
stepping 0 112 47
stone 0 112 47
to 0 112 47
the 0 112 47
next 0 112 47
one. 0 112 47

And 0 112 48
the 0 112 48
one 0 112 48
she 0 112 48
has 0 112 48
her 0 112 48
eyes 0 112 48
on 0 112 48
now 0 112 48
would 0 112 48
be 0 112 48
an 0 112 48
even 1 112 48
bigger 1 112 48
disaster. 1 112 48

Making 0 112 49
Dina 0 112 49
Powell 0 112 49
the 0 112 49
US 0 112 49
Ambassador 0 112 49
to 0 112 49
the 0 112 49
UN 0 112 49
would 0 112 49
quickly 0 112 49
undo 0 112 49
all 0 112 49
the 0 112 49
progress 0 112 49
that 0 112 49
Haley 0 112 49
made. 0 112 49

Before 0 112 50
long 0 112 50
the 0 112 50
US 0 112 50
would 0 112 50
be 0 112 50
right 0 112 50
back 0 112 50
in 0 112 50
the 0 112 50
Human 0 112 50
Rights 0 112 50
Council, 0 112 50
there 0 112 50
would 0 112 50
be 0 112 50
moves 0 112 50
in 0 112 50
favor 0 112 50
of 0 112 50
the 0 112 50
PLO, 0 112 50
and 0 112 50
the 0 112 50
same 1 112 50
old 1 112 50
failed 1 112 50
politics 1 112 50
would 0 112 50
be 0 112 50
back. 0 112 50

Haley 0 112 51
sent 0 112 51
a 0 112 51
message 0 112 51
that 0 112 51
UN 0 112 51
members 0 112 51
will 0 112 51
be 0 112 51
punished 0 112 51
if 0 112 51
they 0 112 51
push 0 112 51
the 0 112 51
US 0 112 51
around. 0 112 51

Powell 0 112 52
would 0 112 52
swiftly 1 112 52
undo 1 112 52
that. 0 112 52

Dina 0 112 53
Powell 0 112 53
would 0 112 53
have 0 112 53
been 0 112 53
a 0 112 53
Jeb 0 112 53
Bush 0 112 53
appointee. 0 112 53

Appointing 1 112 54
her 1 112 54
to 1 112 54
the 1 112 54
UN 1 112 54
would 1 112 54
give 1 112 54
Trump, 1 112 54
Jeb 1 112 54
Bush's 1 112 54
policies. 1 112 54

You 0 112 55
don't 0 112 55
drain 0 112 55
the 0 112 55
swamp 0 112 55
by 0 112 55
appointing 0 112 55

And 0 112 56
Powell 0 112 56
is 0 112 56

the 0 121 7
following: 0 121 7
“And 0 121 7
the 0 121 7
Jews 0 121 7
were 0 121 7
scattered 0 121 7

for 0 121 7
literally 0 121 7
2000 0 121 7

right? 0 121 7

For 0 121 8
1800 0 121 8

odd 0 121 8
years. 0 121 8

And 0 121 9
by 0 121 9
the 0 121 9
way, 0 121 9
everywhere 0 121 9
they 0 121 9

they 0 121 9
were 0 121 9
persecuted, 0 121 9

treated 0 121 9
badly. 0 121 9

Why? 0 121 10

‘Cause 0 121 11
God’s 0 121 11
blessing 0 121 11
them? 0 121 11

No. 0 121 12

‘Cause 1 121 13

under 1 121 13
the 1 121 13
curse 1 121 13
of 1 121 13

the 0 121 14
extreme 0 121 14
torment 0 121 14
they 0 121 14
endured 0 121 14
for 0 121 14

which 0 121 14
includes 0 121 14

so 0 121 14
many 0 121 14

and 0 121 15
beliefs 0 121 15

There's 0 122 7
also 0 122 7
a 0 122 7
quote 0 122 7
from 0 122 7
an 0 122 7
Obama 0 122 7
spokeswoman 0 122 7
claiming 0 122 7
that, 0 122 7
“President 0 122 7
Obama 0 122 7
has 0 122 7
denounced 0 122 7
racism 0 122 7
and 0 122 7
anti-Semitism 0 122 7
his 0 122 7
entire 0 122 7
life. 0 122 7

That 0 122 8
includes 0 122 8
his 0 122 8
public 0 122 8
and 0 122 8
repeated 0 122 8
repudiations 0 122 8
of 0 122 8
Louis 0 122 8
Farrakhan’s 0 122 8
views 0 122 8
over 0 122 8
the 0 122 8
years. 0 122 8

Today 0 122 9
is 0 122 9
no 0 122 9
different 0 122 9
– 0 122 9
he 0 122 9
still 0 122 9
rejects 0 122 9
the 1 122 9
harmful 1 122 9
and 1 122 9
divisive 1 122 9
views 1 122 9
Farrakhan 0 122 9
continues 0 122 9
to 0 122 9
espouse.” 0 122 9

That 0 122 10
fails 1 122 10
to 1 122 10
explain 1 122 10
why 1 122 10
he 1 122 10
met 1 122 10
with 1 122 10
him. 1 122 10

And 0 122 11
maybe 0 122 11
one 0 122 11
of 0 122 11
these 0 122 11
days 0 122 11
someone 0 122 11
will 0 122 11
ask 0 122 11
him 0 122 11
that 0 122 11
question. 0 122 11

And 0 122 12
then 0 122 12
Obama 0 122 12
can 0 122 12
give 0 122 12
a 0 122 12
new 0 122 12
remix 0 122 12
of 0 122 12
his 0 122 12
Wright 0 122 12
speech. 0 122 12

"I 0 122 13
can 0 122 13
no 0 122 13
more 0 122 13
disavow 0 122 13
Calypso 0 122 13

Rep. 0 122 14
Danny 0 122 14
Davis, 0 122 14
after 0 122 14
defending 0 122 14
Farrakhan, 0 122 14
now 0 122 14
has 0 122 14
a 0 122 14
statement 0 122 14
condemning 0 122 14
him. 0 122 14

But 1 122 15
we've 1 122 15
seen 1 122 15
that 1 122 15
before. 1 122 15

So 1 122 16
it 1 122 16
likely 1 122 16
doesn't 1 122 16
represent 1 122 16
his 1 122 16
views. 1 122 16

After 0 122 17
a 0 122 17
previous 0 122 17
statement, 0 122 17
Rep. 0 122 17
Davis 0 122 17
made 0 122 17
an 0 122 17
infamous 0 122 17
comment 0 122 17
about 0 122 17
the 0 122 17
"Jewish 0 122 17
question". 0 122 17

So 0 122 18
it 0 122 18
probably 0 122 18
still 0 122 18
isn't 0 122 18
over. 0 122 18

The 1 122 19
statement 1 122 19
though 1 122 19

The 0 122 28

Obviously 1 122 29
not 1 122 29
going 1 122 29

happen. 1 122 29

But 0 122 30
the 0 122 30

breaking 0 122 30

We're 1 122 31

Reid 0 123 5
Wilson, 0 123 5
a 0 123 5
correspondent 0 123 5
for 0 123 5
the 0 123 5
Hill, 0 123 5
has 0 123 5
posted 0 123 5
to 0 123 5
Twitter 0 123 5
a 0 123 5
year 0 123 5
by 0 123 5
year 0 123 5
breakdown 0 123 5
of 0 123 5
sexual 0 123 5
harassment 0 123 5
settlements 0 123 5
and 0 123 5
awards 0 123 5
that 0 123 5
he 0 123 5
received 0 123 5
from 0 123 5
the 0 123 5
Congressional 0 123 5
Office 0 123 5
of 0 123 5
Compliance. 0 123 5

I 0 123 6
went 0 123 6
ahead 0 123 6
and 0 123 6
added 0 123 6
up 0 123 6
each 0 123 6
column, 0 123 6
and 0 123 6
what 0 123 6
I 0 123 6
discovered 0 123 6
is 0 123 6
that 0 123 6
264 0 123 6
cases 0 123 6
of 0 123 6
sexual 0 123 6
harassment 0 123 6
in 0 123 6
Congress 0 123 6
have 0 123 6
been 0 123 6
settled 0 123 6
since 0 123 6
1997, 0 123 6
and 0 123 6
the 0 123 6
total 0 123 6
amount 0 123 6
awarded 0 123 6
in 0 123 6
those 0 123 6
settlements 0 123 6
comes 0 123 6
to 0 123 6
a 0 123 6
grand 0 123 6
total 0 123 6
of 0 123 6
$17,250,854. 0 123 6

So 0 123 7
where 0 123 7
has 0 123 7
the 0 123 7
$17,250,854 0 123 7
come 0 123 7
from 0 123 7
to 0 123 7
pay 0 123 7
those 0 123 7
settlements? 0 123 7

That 1 123 8
money 1 123 8
has 1 123 8
come 1 123 8
from 1 123 8
the 1 123 8
taxpayers 1 123 8
of 1 123 8
course. 1 123 8

That 0 123 9
means 0 123 9
that 0 123 9
you 0 123 9
and 0 123 9
I 0 123 9
have 0 123 9
been 0 123 9
paying 0 123 9
to 0 123 9
cover 0 123 9
up 0 123 9
the 1 123 9
epidemic 1 123 9
of 1 123 9
sexual 1 123 9
harassment 1 123 9
that 0 123 9
has 0 123 9
been 0 123 9
taking 0 123 9
place 0 123 9
on 0 123 9
Capitol 0 123 9
Hill. 0 123 9

When 0 123 10
U.S. 0 123 10
Representative 0 123 10
Jackie 0 123 10
Speier 0 123 10
originally 0 123 10
told 0 123 10
us 0 123 10
that 0 123 10
more 0 123 10
than 0 123 10
15 0 123 10
million 0 123 10
dollars 0 123 10
had 0 123 10
been 0 123 10
paid 0 123 10
out 0 123 10
to 0 123 10
victims 0 123 10
of 0 123 10
sexual 0 123 10
harassment 0 123 10
in 0 123 10
recent 0 123 10
years, 0 123 10
I 0 123 10
was 0 123 10
envisioning 0 123 10
a 0 123 10
few 0 123 10
dozen 0 123 10
cases 0 123 10
at 0 123 10
most. 0 123 10

I 0 123 11
had 0 123 11
no 0 123 11
idea 0 123 11
that 0 123 11
the 0 123 11
total 0 123 11
number 0 123 11
of 0 123 11
cases 0 123 11
would 0 123 11
actually 0 123 11
be 0 123 11
well 0 123 11
over 0 123 11
200. 0 123 11

If 0 123 12
our 0 123 12
leaders 0 123 12
were 0 123 12
serious 0 123 12
about 0 123 12
stopping 0 123 12
this 0 123 12
from 0 123 12
happening, 0 123 12
they 0 123 12
would 0 123 12
pass 0 123 12
a 0 123 12
law 0 123 12
making 0 123 12
it 0 123 12
mandatory 0 123 12
that 0 123 12
all 0 123 12
cases 0 123 12
of 0 123 12
sexual 0 123 12
harassment 0 123 12
in 0 123 12
Congress 0 123 12
be 0 123 12
made 0 123 12
public, 0 123 12
and 0 123 12
that 0 123 12
members 0 123 12
of 0 123 12
Congress 0 123 12
would 0 123 12
be 0 123 12
personally 0 123 12
responsible 0 123 12
for 0 123 12
paying 0 123 12
out 0 123 12
any 0 123 12
settlements. 0 123 12

If 1 123 13
such 1 123 13
a 1 123 13
law 1 123 13
was 1 123 13
instituted, 1 123 13
I 1 123 13
guarantee 1 123 13
you 1 123 13
that 1 123 13
sexual 1 123 13
harassment 1 123 13
on 1 123 13
Capitol 1 123 13
Hill 1 123 13
would 1 123 13
come 1 123 13
to 1 123 13
a 1 123 13
screeching 1 123 13
halt. 1 123 13

But 0 123 14
they 0 123 14
don’t 0 123 14
want 0 123 14
it 0 123 14
to 0 123 14
stop. 0 123 14

For 1 123 15
many 1 123 15
in 1 123 15
Congress, 1 123 15
having 1 123 15
so 1 123 15
many 1 123 15
attractive 1 123 15
young 1 123 15
women 1 123 15
around 1 123 15
is 1 123 15
one 1 123 15
of 1 123 15
the 1 123 15
key 1 123 15
benefits 1 123 15
of 1 123 15
the 1 123 15
job. 1 123 15

I 0 123 16
included 0 123 16
the 0 123 16
following 0 123 16
quote 0 123 16
from 0 123 16
CNN 0 123 16
in 0 123 16
an 0 123 16
article 0 123 16
the 0 123 16
other 0 123 16
day, 0 123 16
but 0 123 16
I 0 123 16
also 0 123 16
believe 0 123 16
that 0 123 16
it 0 123 16
fits 0 123 16
just 0 123 16
perfectly 0 123 16
here… 0 123 16

In 0 123 17
an 0 123 17
environment 0 123 17
with 0 123 17
“so 0 123 17
many 0 123 17
young 0 123 17
women,” 0 123 17
said 0 123 17
one 0 123 17
ex-House 0 123 17
aide, 0 123 17
the 1 123 17
men 1 123 17
“have 1 123 17
no 1 123 17
self-control.” 1 123 17
“Amongst 0 123 17
ourselves, 0 123 17
we 0 123 17
know,” 0 123 17
a 0 123 17
former 0 123 17
Senate 0 123 17
staffer 0 123 17
said 0 123 17
of 0 123 17
the 1 123 17
lawmakers 1 123 17
with 1 123 17
the 1 123 17
worst 1 123 17
reputations. 1 123 17

And 0 123 18
sometimes, 0 123 18
the 0 123 18
sexual 0 123 18
advances 0 123 18
from 0 123 18
members 0 123 18
of 0 123 18
Congress 0 123 18
or 0 123 18
senior 0 123 18
aides 0 123 18
are 0 123 18
reciprocated 0 123 18
in 0 123 18
the 0 123 18
hopes 0 123 18
of 0 123 18
advancing 0 123 18
one’s 0 123 18
career 0 123 18
— 0 123 18
what 0 123 18
one 0 123 18
political 0 123 18
veteran 0 123 18
bluntly 0 123 18
referred 0 123 18
to 0 123 18
as 0 123 18
a 0 123 18
“sex 1 123 18
trade 1 123 18
on 1 123 18
Capitol 1 123 18
Hill.” 1 123 18

Do 0 123 19
you 0 123 19
want 0 123 19
to 0 123 19
stop 0 123 19
this 0 123 19
from 0 123 19
happening? 0 123 19

It 1 123 20
isn’t 1 123 20
going 1 123 20
to 1 123 20
stop 1 123 20
until 1 123 20
we 1 123 20
boot 1 123 20
out 1 123 20
the 1 123 20
corrupt 1 123 20
career 1 123 20
politicians 1 123 20
that 1 123 20
are 1 123 20
engaging 1 123 20
in 1 123 20
this 1 123 20
type 1 123 20
of 1 123 20
behavior. 1 123 20

So 0 123 21
I 0 123 21
am 0 123 21
asking 0 123 21
you 0 123 21
to 0 123 21
support 0 123 21
my 0 123 21
campaign 0 123 21
and 0 123 21
other 0 123 21
“grassroots 1 123 21
deplorables” 1 123 21
that 0 123 21
are 0 123 21
running 0 123 21
for 0 123 21
office 0 123 21
all 0 123 21
over 0 123 21
the 0 123 21
nation. 0 123 21

Morality 0 123 22
really 0 123 22
matters 0 123 22
when 0 123 22
it 0 123 22

serving 0 123 22
in 0 123 22

we 0 123 22

I 0 123 23

have 0 123 23
been 0 123 23
settled 0 123 23
since 0 123 23
1997. 0 123 23

The 1 123 24
American 1 123 24
people 1 123 24
have 1 123 24
a 1 123 24
right 1 123 24
to 1 123 24
know, 1 123 24
and 0 123 24
those 0 123 24
that 0 123 24
engaged 0 123 24
in 0 123 24
this 0 123 24
type 0 123 24

do 0 123 24
not 0 123 24

It 0 123 25
is 0 123 25
time 0 123 25
to 0 123 25
drain 0 123 25
the 0 123 25

this 0 123 25

the 0 134 2
label 0 134 2
Authentic 0 134 2
Magisterium® 0 134 2
on 0 134 2
his 0 134 2
outrageous 0 134 2
opinion 0 134 2
that 0 134 2

“complex 0 134 2

Father 0 134 2
Brian 0 134 2
Harrison 0 134 2
has 0 134 2
so 0 134 2
trenchantly 0 134 2
observed, 0 134 2
this 0 134 2
means 0 134 2
that 0 134 2
people 0 134 2
embroiled 0 134 2
in 0 134 2
adultery 0 134 2
can 0 134 2
receive 0 134 2
Holy 0 134 2
Communion 0 134 2
while 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
“discern” 0 134 2
that 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
should 0 134 2
not 0 134 2
be 0 134 2
receiving 0 134 2
Holy 0 134 2
Communion 0 134 2
because 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
are 0 134 2
embroiled 0 134 2
in 0 134 2
adultery. 0 134 2

Do 1 134 3
they 1 134 3
think 1 134 3
we 1 134 3
are 1 134 3
fools? 1 134 3

Then 0 134 4

demonstrating 0 134 5
that 0 134 5
the 0 134 5
administration 0 134 5
of 0 134 5
Holy 0 134 5
Communion 0 134 5
to 0 134 5
public 0 134 5
adulterers 0 134 5
is 0 134 5
consistent 0 134 5
with 0 134 5
the 0 134 5
Church’s 0 134 5
bimillenial 0 134 5
prohibition 0 134 5
of 0 134 5
precisely 0 134 5
that, 0 134 5
Müller 0 134 5
proposed 0 134 5
this 0 134 5
preposterous 1 134 5
“solution” 1 134 5
to 0 134 5
a 0 134 5
“problem” 0 134 5
that 0 134 5
does 0 134 5
not 0 134 5
exist: 0 134 5

It 0 134 6
is 0 134 6
possible 0 134 6
that 0 134 6
the 0 134 6
penitent 0 134 6
may 0 134 6
be 0 134 6
convinced 0 134 6
in 0 134 6
conscience, 0 134 6
and 0 134 6
with 0 134 6
good 0 134 6
reasons, 0 134 6
of 0 134 6
the 0 134 6
invalidity 0 134 6
of 0 134 6
the 0 134 6
first 0 134 6
marriage 0 134 6
even 0 134 6
though 0 134 6
they 0 134 6
cannot 0 134 6
offer 0 134 6
canonical 0 134 6
proof. 0 134 6

In 0 134 7
this 0 134 7
case 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
marriage 0 134 7
valid 0 134 7
before 0 134 7
God 0 134 7
would 0 134 7
be 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
second 0 134 7
one 0 134 7
and 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
pastor 0 134 7
could 0 134 7
grant 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
sacrament, 0 134 7
certainly 0 134 7
with 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
appropriate 0 134 7
precautions 0 134 7
as 0 134 7
not 0 134 7
to 0 134 7
scandalize 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
community 0 134 7
of 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
faithful 0 134 7
and 0 134 7
not 0 134 7
to 0 134 7
weaken 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
conviction 0 134 7
of 0 134 7
marriage 0 134 7
indissolubility. 0 134 7

The 0 134 8
Cardinal 0 134 8
knows 0 134 8
this 0 134 8
is 0 134 8
moral 1 134 8
and 1 134 8
canonical 1 134 8
nonsense. 1 134 8

No 1 134 9
Catholic, 1 134 9
whether 1 134 9
or 1 134 9
not 1 134 9
he 1 134 9
consults 1 134 9
a 1 134 9
priest, 1 134 9
can 1 134 9
declare 1 134 9
for 1 134 9
himself 1 134 9
that 1 134 9
his 1 134 9
marriage 1 134 9
in 1 134 9
the 1 134 9
Church 1 134 9
was 1 134 9
invalid, 1 134 9
especially 1 134 9
when—indeed 1 134 9
because—he 1 134 9
lacks 1 134 9
canonical 1 134 9
proof 1 134 9
of 1 134 9
invalidity. 1 134 9

Moreover, 0 134 10
absent 0 134 10
an 0 134 10
annulment 0 134 10
granted 0 134 10
by 0 134 10

a 0 134 10

an 0 134 10
invalid 0 134 10
civil 0 134 10
ceremony 0 134 10
and 0 134 10
thus 0 134 10
a 0 134 10
thinly 0 134 10
disguised 0 134 10
form 0 134 10
of 0 134 10
continuous 0 134 10

The 0 134 16
only 0 134 16
case 0 134 16
in 0 134 16
which 0 134 16
a 0 134 16

could 0 134 16
admit 0 134 16
a 0 134 16
person 0 134 16

of 0 134 16
Penance 0 134 16

Holy 0 134 16

the 0 134 16

of 0 134 16
a 0 134 16
couple 0 134 16
who 0 134 16
agree 0 134 16
to 0 134 16
live 0 134 16
“as 0 134 16

that 0 134 16

respect 0 134 16
the 0 134 16

Even 0 134 17
then, 0 134 17
the 0 134 17

would 0 134 17
have 0 134 17

they 0 134 17
are 0 134 17
not 0 134 17
well 0 134 17
known, 0 134 17
lest 0 134 17
other 0 134 17
faithful 0 134 17
be 0 134 17
led 0 134 17
to 0 134 17
believe 0 134 17
that 0 134 17
persons 0 134 17
living 0 134 17
in 0 134 17
an 0 134 17
irregular 0 134 17

Does 0 134 18
Cardinal 0 134 18
Müller 0 134 18
think 0 134 18
we 0 134 18
are 0 134 18
fools? 0 134 18

Some 0 134 19
of 0 134 19
us 0 134 19
apparently 0 134 19
are, 0 134 19
or 0 134 19
at 0 134 19
least 0 134 19
are 0 134 19
willing 0 134 19
to 0 134 19
serve 0 134 19
as 0 134 19
knowing 0 134 19
dupes 0 134 19
by 0 134 19
defending 0 134 19
neo-Pharisaical 0 134 19
sophistry 0 134 19
that 0 134 19
would 0 134 19
produce 0 134 19
“a 0 134 19
discipline 0 134 19
alien 0 134 19
to 0 134 19
the 0 134 19

the 0 134 19
Catholic 0 134 19
and 0 134 19

Apparently, 0 134 20
they 0 134 20
think 0 134 20
they 0 134 20
can 0 134 20
fool 1 134 20
us 0 134 20
in 0 134 20
the 0 134 20
next 0 134 20
phase 0 134 20
of 0 134 20

that 0 134 20
this 0 134 20
incredible 0 134 20

seriously 0 134 20
expects 0 134 20
us 0 134 20
to 0 134 20
believe 0 134 20
is 0 134 20
an 0 134 20
imperative 0 134 20
of 0 134 20
“mercy”: 0 134 20
the 0 134 20
justification 0 134 20

in 0 134 20

important 0 142 20

political 0 142 21
powers 0 142 21
behind 0 142 21

But 0 142 23
who 1 142 23
guards 1 142 23
the 1 142 23

For 0 142 24
if 0 142 24
Dr. 0 142 24

very 0 142 24
worrying 0 142 24
questions 0 142 24
to 0 142 24
ask. 0 142 24

One 0 142 25
could 0 142 25
start 0 142 25
from 0 142 25
the 0 142 25
observation 0 142 25
that 0 142 25
the 0 142 25

certainly 0 142 25
not 0 142 25
an 0 142 25
academic 0 142 25
piece, 0 142 25
and 0 142 25
gives 0 142 25
no 0 142 25
concrete 0 142 25
evidence 0 142 25
for 0 142 25
any 0 142 25
of 0 142 25
the 0 142 25
sweeping 0 142 25
claims 0 142 25
it 0 142 25
makes 0 142 25
about 0 142 25
the 0 142 25
so-called 0 142 25
“alt-right” 0 142 25
and 0 142 25
the 0 142 25
“manosphere”; 0 142 25
nor 0 142 25
does 0 142 25
it, 0 142 25
as 0 142 25
any 0 142 25
academic 0 142 25
should 0 142 25
do, 0 142 25

(Oddly 0 142 26

this 0 142 26

the 0 142 27
label 0 142 27
of 0 142 27
“violent 1 142 27
extremist” 1 142 27
turns 0 142 27
out 0 142 27
to 0 142 27
be 0 142 27
used 0 142 27
very 0 142 27
generously. 0 142 27

Ganesh 0 142 28
makes 0 142 28
wild 1 142 28
leaps 0 142 28
and 0 142 28
inferences. 0 142 28

He 0 142 29
talks 0 142 29
of 0 142 29
Darren 0 142 29

the 0 142 29

Mosque. 0 142 29

This 0 142 30
was 0 142 30
a 0 142 30
heinous 1 142 30
crime, 0 142 30
and 0 142 30
should 0 142 30
rightly 0 142 30
be 0 142 30
condemned. 0 142 30

But 0 142 31
why 0 142 31
did 0 142 31
Osborne 0 142 31
do 0 142 31
this, 0 142 31
according 0 142 31
to 0 142 31
Ganesh? 0 142 31

The 0 142 32
attack 0 142 32
“was 0 142 32
executed 0 142 32
after 0 142 32
he 0 142 32
had 0 142 32

make 0 142 32

it. 0 142 32

He 0 142 33

British 0 142 33

is 0 142 33
thus 0 142 33
swept 0 142 33
into 0 142 33

“knows” 1 142 33

encouraged 0 142 33
him. 0 142 33

The 0 142 34

on 0 142 34
real 0 142 34

Ganesh 0 142 35
somehow 0 142 35
knows 0 142 35
precisely 0 142 35
what 0 142 35
went 0 142 35
on 0 142 35
in 0 142 35
Osborne’s 0 142 35
mind. 0 142 35

Rather 0 142 36
than 0 142 36
thinking 0 142 36
that 0 142 36
it 0 142 36
was 0 142 36
outrage 0 142 36
at 0 142 36

portrayed 0 142 36
in 0 142 36
Three 0 142 36

blames 0 142 36
Obsorne’s 0 142 36

Yet 0 142 37

explicitly 0 142 37
fights 0 142 37
AGAINST 1 142 37

What 1 142 38
“narrative 1 142 38
from 1 142 38
British 1 142 38
counter-jihad 1 142 38
groups” 1 142 38
can 1 142 38
one 1 142 38
find 1 142 38
which 1 142 38
suggests 1 142 38
driving 1 142 38
vehicles 1 142 38
into 1 142 38
innocent 1 142 38
Muslims 1 142 38
standing 1 142 38
outside 1 142 38
a 1 142 38
mosque? 1 142 38

I’m 0 142 39
sure 0 142 39
if 0 142 39
there 0 142 39
was 0 142 39
any, 0 142 39
Ganesh 0 142 39
would, 0 142 39
as 0 142 39
a 0 142 39
researcher 0 142 39
at 0 142 39
an 0 142 39
elite 0 142 39
institution, 0 142 39
be 0 142 39
able 0 142 39
to 0 142 39
find 0 142 39
it. 0 142 39

But 0 142 40
there 1 142 40
is 1 142 40
none 1 142 40
offered 1 142 40
– 0 142 40
only 0 142 40
surmise 0 142 40
and 0 142 40
Ganesh’s 0 142 40
mindreading 0 142 40
techniques. 0 142 40

I 0 142 41
suppose 0 142 41
if 0 142 41
you’re 0 142 41
paid 0 142 41
to 0 142 41
fight 0 142 41
online 0 142 41
extremism, 0 142 41
you’d 0 142 41
better 0 142 41
find 0 142 41
it, 0 142 41
or 0 142 41
you’re 0 142 41
out 0 142 41
of 0 142 41
a 0 142 41
job 0 142 41
and 0 142 41
short 0 142 41
of 0 142 41
academic 0 142 41
publication. 0 142 41

We 0 142 42
have 0 142 42
also 0 142 42
the 0 142 42
ridiculous 1 142 42
idea 0 142 42
that 0 142 42
Tommy 0 142 42
Robinson 0 142 42
is 0 142 42
“alt-right.” 0 142 42
He, 0 142 42
in 0 142 42
fact, 0 142 42
describes 0 142 42
himself 0 142 42
as 0 142 42
a 0 142 42
centrist 0 142 42
– 0 142 42
he’s 0 142 42
said 0 142 42
he 0 142 42
agrees 0 142 42
with 0 142 42
Labour 0 142 42
on 0 142 42
some 0 142 42
things, 0 142 42
the 0 142 42
Tories 0 142 42
on 0 142 42
other 0 142 42
things, 0 142 42
and 0 142 42
he 0 142 42
left 0 142 42
the 0 142 42
EDL 0 142 42
precisely 0 142 42
because 0 142 42
he 0 142 42
didn’t 0 142 42
like 0 142 42
the 0 142 42
infiltration 0 142 42
by 0 142 42
the 0 142 42
far 0 142 42
right. 0 142 42

He 0 142 43
shows 0 142 43
no 0 142 43
hint 0 142 43
of 0 142 43
racism 0 142 43
or 0 142 43
of 0 142 43
white 0 142 43

The 0 142 44

to 0 142 45

Is 0 142 46
it 0 142 46
simply 0 142 46
a 0 142 46
coincidence 0 142 46
that 0 142 46

A 0 152 8

come 0 152 8
when 0 152 8
the 0 152 8
civilized 0 152 8

its 0 152 8
God, 0 152 8
when 0 152 8
the 0 152 8

will 0 152 8
doubt 0 152 8
as 0 152 8
Peter 0 152 8

She 0 152 9
will 0 152 9

In 0 152 10
our 0 152 10

vain 1 152 10

God 1 152 10
awaits 1 152 10
them. 1 152 10

Mary 1 152 11
Magdalene, 1 152 11
weeping 1 152 11
before 1 152 11
the 1 152 11
empty 1 152 11

they 0 152 11

His 0 152 19
attempt 0 152 19
to 0 152 19
debunk 0 152 19
the 0 152 19
quotation 0 152 19

nit-picking 0 152 19
about 0 152 19
what 1 152 19
he 1 152 19

But 1 152 20
he 1 152 20
had 1 152 20
no 1 152 20
evidence 1 152 20
that 1 152 20
the 1 152 20
quotation 1 152 20
as 1 152 20
such 1 152 20
was 1 152 20
a 1 152 20
fabrication. 1 152 20

He 1 152 21
simply 1 152 21
wished 1 152 21

it 1 152 21

This 0 152 23

he 0 152 24
called 0 152 24
together 0 152 24
his 0 152 24
children 0 152 24

warned 0 152 24
them 0 152 24
of 0 152 24
the 0 152 24
coming 0 152 24

“Act 1 152 25
bravely, 1 152 25
my 1 152 25
brethren; 1 152 25
take 1 152 25
courage 1 152 25
and 1 152 25
trust 1 152 25
in 1 152 25

fast 0 152 26
approaching 0 152 26

will 0 152 26
be 0 152 26
great 0 152 26

dissensions, 0 152 26
both 0 152 26
spiritual 0 152 26
and 0 152 26
temporal, 0 152 26
will 0 152 26
abound; 0 152 26
the 0 152 26
charity 0 152 26
of 0 152 26
many 0 152 26
will 0 152 26
grow 0 152 26
cold, 0 152 26
and 0 152 26
the 1 152 26
malice 1 152 26
of 1 152 26
the 1 152 26
wicked 1 152 26
will 1 152 26
increase. 1 152 26

The 1 152 27
devils 1 152 27
will 1 152 27
have 1 152 27
unusual 1 152 27
power; 1 152 27
the 1 152 27
immaculate 1 152 27

our 1 152 27

so 1 152 27
much 1 152 27
obscured 1 152 27
that 1 152 27
there 1 152 27
will 1 152 27
be 1 152 27
very 1 152 27

with 1 152 27
loyal 1 152 27

perfect 1 152 27
charity. 1 152 27

“At 0 152 28
the 0 152 28
time 0 152 28

correspond 1 152 42
rather 1 152 42
well 1 152 42
with 1 152 42
the 1 152 42
pontificate 1 152 42
of 1 152 42
the 1 152 42
only 1 152 42
Pope 1 152 42
who 1 152 42
has 1 152 42
taken 1 152 42

as 1 152 42
his 1 152 42
own? 1 152 42

Something 0 152 43
else 0 152 43
to 0 152 43
consider: 0 152 43
Saint 0 152 43
Francis, 0 152 43
one 0 152 43
of 0 152 43
the 0 152 43
greatest 0 152 43
saints 0 152 43
in 0 152 43
Church 0 152 43
history, 0 152 43
one 0 152 43
of 0 152 43
the 0 152 43
few 0 152 43
who 0 152 43
is 0 152 43
known 0 152 43

revered 0 152 43
by 0 152 43
the 0 152 43
whole 0 152 43
world, 0 152 43
freely 0 152 43
revealed 0 152 43
his 0 152 43
vision 0 152 43
of 0 152 43
an 0 152 43
ecclesial 0 152 43

who 0 152 43
usurps 0 152 43
the 0 152 43

office. 0 152 43

That 0 152 44
is, 0 152 44
Saint 0 152 44
Francis 0 152 44
did 0 152 44
not 0 152 44
suffer 0 152 44
from 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
currently 0 152 44
reigning 0 152 44
papolatry, 0 152 44
which 0 152 44
holds 0 152 44
that 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
indefectibility 0 152 44
of 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
Church 0 152 44
depends 0 152 44
upon 0 152 44
defending 0 152 44
every 0 152 44
word 0 152 44
and 0 152 44
deed 0 152 44
of 0 152 44
a 0 152 44
given 0 152 44
Pope 0 152 44
as 0 152 44
somehow 0 152 44
consistent 0 152 44
with 0 152 44
Tradition 0 152 44
and 0 152 44
declares 0 152 44
absolutely 0 152 44
inadmissible 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
idea 0 152 44
that 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
holder 0 152 44
of 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
Petrine 0 152 44
office 0 152 44
could 0 152 44
be 0 152 44
a 0 152 44
threat 0 152 44
to 0 152 44
the 0 152 44
integrity 0 152 44
of 0 152 44

Preliminary 0 158 14
information 0 158 14
suggests 0 158 14
that 0 158 14
the 0 158 14

home 0 158 14

after 0 158 14
working 0 158 14
a 0 158 14
full 0 158 14

that 0 158 15
she 0 158 15
entered 0 158 15
the 0 158 15
victim’s 0 158 15
apartment 0 158 15
believing 0 158 15
that 0 158 15
it 0 158 15
was 0 158 15
her 0 158 15
own. 0 158 15

At 0 158 16
some 0 158 16
point, 0 158 16
the 0 158 16

her 0 158 16
weapon 0 158 16
striking 0 158 16
the 0 158 16

male, 0 158 17
at 0 158 17

was 0 158 26
home 0 158 26
alone 0 158 26
when 0 158 26
Guyger 0 158 26
mistook 0 158 26
his 0 158 26

for 0 158 26
hers, 0 158 26
the 1 158 26

Guyger 0 158 27
lived 0 158 27
on 0 158 27
the 0 158 27
third 0 158 27
floor, 0 158 27
directly 0 158 27
beneath 0 158 27
his 0 158 27
apartment, 0 158 27
and 0 158 27
mistakenly 0 158 27
parked 0 158 27
on 0 158 27
the 0 158 27
fourth 0 158 27
floor 0 158 27
after 0 158 27
finishing 0 158 27

Police 0 158 27
Department, 0 158 27
the 1 158 27
affidavit 1 158 27
says. 1 158 27

When 0 158 28
she 0 158 28
arrived 0 158 28
at 0 158 28
Jean's 0 158 28
door, 0 158 28
Guyger 0 158 28
entered 0 158 28
a 0 158 28
unique 0 158 28
door 0 158 28
key 0 158 28
with 0 158 28
an 0 158 28
electronic 0 158 28
chip 0 158 28
into 0 158 28
the 0 158 28
keyhole, 0 158 28
the 1 158 28
affidavit 1 158 28
says. 1 158 28

The 0 158 29
door 0 158 29
was 0 158 29
already 0 158 29
ajar, 0 158 29
so 0 158 29
the 0 158 29
force 0 158 29
of 0 158 29
pushing 0 158 29
the 0 158 29
key 0 158 29
inside 0 158 29
opened 0 158 29
the 0 158 29
door, 0 158 29
according 0 158 29
to 0 158 29
the 0 158 29
affidavit. 0 158 29

The 1 158 30
affidavit 1 158 30
says 1 158 30
the 0 158 30
apartments' 0 158 30
"respective 0 158 30
interior 0 158 30
floorplans 0 158 30
are 0 158 30
in 0 158 30
most 0 158 30
ways 0 158 30
identical 0 158 30
or 0 158 30
extremely 0 158 30
similar." 0 158 30

The 0 158 31
apartment 0 158 31
was 0 158 31
dark 0 158 31
and 0 158 31
when 0 158 31
she 0 158 31
saw 0 158 31
"a 0 158 31
large 0 158 31
silhouette," 0 158 31
Guyger 0 158 31
thought 0 158 31
she 0 158 31
was 0 158 31
being 0 158 31
burglarized, 0 158 31
the 1 158 31
affidavit 1 158 31
says. 1 158 31

The 1 158 32
affidavit 1 158 32
says 1 158 32
Guyger 0 158 32
drew 0 158 32
her 0 158 32
gun, 0 158 32
"gave 0 158 32
verbal 0 158 32
commands 0 158 32
that 0 158 32
were 0 158 32
ignored" 0 158 32
and 0 158 32
fired 0 158 32
twice. 0 158 32

Jean 0 158 33
was 0 158 33
struck 0 158 33
once 0 158 33
in 0 158 33
the 0 158 33
torso. 0 158 33

Guyger 0 158 34
then 0 158 34
called 0 158 34
911 0 158 34
from 0 158 34
her 0 158 34
cellphone 0 158 34
and 0 158 34
started 0 158 34
performing 0 158 34
first 0 158 34
aid. 0 158 34

She 0 158 35
turned 0 158 35
on 0 158 35
the 0 158 35
lights, 0 158 35
then 0 158 35
went 0 158 35
to 0 158 35
the 0 158 35
front 0 158 35
door 0 158 35
again 0 158 35
and 0 158 35
realized 0 158 35
the 0 158 35
apartment 0 158 35
wasn't 0 158 35
hers, 0 158 35
the 1 158 35
affidavit 1 158 35
says. 1 158 35

She 0 158 36
told 0 158 36
the 0 158 36
911 0 158 36
operator 0 158 36
as 0 158 36
well 0 158 36
as 0 158 36
responding 0 158 36
officers 0 158 36
that 0 158 36
she 0 158 36
thought 0 158 36
she 0 158 36
was 0 158 36
at 0 158 36
her 0 158 36
apartment 0 158 36
when 0 158 36
she 0 158 36
shot 0 158 36
Jean, 0 158 36
according 1 158 36
to 1 158 36
the 1 158 36
affidavit. 1 158 36

Ok, 0 158 37
some 0 158 37
of 0 158 37
this 0 158 37
seems 0 158 37
plausible, 0 158 37
but 0 158 37
I 0 158 37
still 0 158 37
am 0 158 37
left 0 158 37
wondering 0 158 37
about 0 158 37
the 0 158 37
door 0 158 37
being 0 158 37
ajar. 0 158 37

Is 0 158 38
this 0 158 38
something 0 158 38
people 0 158 38
are 0 158 38
prone 0 158 38
to 0 158 38
do 0 158 38
at 0 158 38
1o 0 158 38
o'clock 0 158 38
at 0 158 38
night 0 158 38
in 0 158 38
Dallas? 0 158 38

In 0 158 39
any 0 158 39
case, 0 158 39
we 0 158 39
all 0 158 39
know 0 158 39
that 0 158 39
any 0 158 39
of 0 158 39
us 0 158 39
who 0 158 39
did 0 158 39
the 0 158 39
same 0 158 39
thing 0 158 39
would 0 158 39
have 0 158 39
immediately 0 158 39
been 0 158 39
taken 0 158 39
into 0 158 39
custody. 0 158 39

This 0 158 40
was 0 158 40
not 0 158 40
the 0 158 40
case 0 158 40
with 0 158 40
Guyger, 0 158 40
though 0 158 40
one 0 158 40
officer 0 158 40
close 0 158 40
to 0 158 40
her 0 158 40
said, 0 158 40
"she 0 158 40
is 0 158 40
devastated." 0 158 40

Knowing 0 158 41
this 0 158 41
provoked 0 158 41
outrage 0 158 41
across 0 158 41
the 0 158 41
nation 0 158 41
over 0 158 41
the 0 158 41
weekend. 0 158 41

In 0 158 42
fact, 0 158 42
this 0 158 42
is 0 158 42
not 0 158 42
her 0 158 42
first 0 158 42
shooting. 0 158 42

As 0 158 43
a 0 158 43

Perez, 0 158 45

Another 0 158 46

in 0 158 46
a 0 158 46
Pleasant 0 158 46

When 0 158 47
the 0 158 47
officer 0 158 47
thought 0 158 47
he 0 158 47
saw 0 158 47

the 0 158 47
officer 0 158 47
asked 0 158 47
for 0 158 47

according 0 158 47

One 0 158 48

when 0 158 48

the 1 158 48

Guyger 0 158 49

the 0 161 26

The 0 161 27
History 0 161 27
of 0 161 27
Jihad 0 161 27
shows 0 161 27
from 0 161 27
the 0 161 27
accounts 0 161 27
of 0 161 27
eyewitnesses 0 161 27
and 0 161 27
contemporary 0 161 27
chroniclers 0 161 27
through 0 161 27
the 0 161 27
ages 0 161 27
that 0 161 27
in 0 161 27
every 0 161 27
age 0 161 27
and 0 161 27
in 0 161 27
every 0 161 27
place 0 161 27
where 0 161 27
there 0 161 27
were 0 161 27
Muslims, 0 161 27
some 0 161 27
of 0 161 27
them 0 161 27
believed 0 161 27
that 0 161 27
they 0 161 27
had 0 161 27
a 0 161 27
responsibility 0 161 27
given 0 161 27
to 0 161 27
them 0 161 27
by 0 161 27
Allah 0 161 27
to 0 161 27
wage 0 161 27
war 0 161 27
against 0 161 27
and 0 161 27
subjugate 0 161 27
unbelievers 0 161 27

the 0 161 27
rule 0 161 27
of 0 161 27
Islamic 0 161 27
law. 0 161 27

And 0 161 28
so 0 161 28
it 0 161 28
is 0 161 28
today: 0 161 28
Said 0 161 28
Khecharem 0 161 28
has 0 161 28
enunciated 0 161 28
that 0 161 28
responsibility 0 161 28
more 0 161 28
clearly 0 161 28
and 0 161 28
directly 0 161 28
than 0 161 28
most 0 161 28
Muslim 0 161 28
spokesmen 0 161 28
do 0 161 28
these 0 161 28
days, 0 161 28
but 0 161 28
he 0 161 28
is 0 161 28
by 0 161 28
no 0 161 28
means 0 161 28
the 0 161 28
only 0 161 28
one 0 161 28
who 0 161 28
believes 0 161 28
that 0 161 28
it 0 161 28
exists. 0 161 28

What 0 161 29
is 0 161 29
noteworthy 0 161 29
also 0 161 29
about 0 161 29
The 0 161 29
History 0 161 29
of 0 161 29
Jihad 0 161 29
is 0 161 29
something 0 161 29
that 0 161 29
it 0 161 29
does 0 161 29
not 0 161 29
contain. 0 161 29

As 0 161 30
the 0 161 30
jihadis 0 161 30
move 0 161 30
against 0 161 30
non-Muslim 0 161 30
states 0 161 30
without 0 161 30
any 0 161 30
letup, 0 161 30
pause, 0 161 30
period 0 161 30
of 0 161 30
coexistence, 0 161 30
period 0 161 30
of 0 161 30
tolerance, 0 161 30
reformation, 0 161 30
or 0 161 30
reconsideration, 0 161 30
there 0 161 30
never 0 161 30
appears 0 161 30
any 0 161 30
force 0 161 30
of 0 161 30
Muslims 0 161 30
to 0 161 30
oppose 0 161 30
them. 0 161 30

While 0 161 31
it 0 161 31
is 0 161 31
undoubtedly 0 161 31
true 0 161 31
that 0 161 31
not 0 161 31
all 0 161 31
Muslims 0 161 31
in 0 161 31
any 0 161 31
given 0 161 31
age 0 161 31
have 0 161 31
ever 0 161 31
waged 0 161 31
jihad, 0 161 31
there 0 161 31
has 0 161 31
never 0 161 31
been 0 161 31
in 0 161 31
Islamic 0 161 31
history 0 161 31
an 0 161 31
Islamic 0 161 31
entity 0 161 31
or 0 161 31
organization 0 161 31
that 0 161 31
was 0 161 31
opposed 0 161 31
to 0 161 31
waging 0 161 31
jihad 0 161 31
and 0 161 31
dedicated 0 161 31
to 0 161 31
stopping 0 161 31
those 0 161 31
who 0 161 31
were 0 161 31
waging 0 161 31
it. 0 161 31

So 0 161 32
it 0 161 32
is 0 161 32
today. 0 161 32

Islamic 0 161 33
groups 0 161 33
in 0 161 33
the 0 161 33
West 0 161 33

attack, 0 161 33
but 0 161 33
are 0 161 33
doing 0 161 33
little 0 161 33
or 0 161 33
nothing 0 161 33
to 0 161 33
try 0 161 33
to 0 161 33
prevent 0 161 33
the 0 161 33
next 0 161 33
one. 0 161 33

There 1 161 34
is 1 161 34
still 1 161 34
no 1 161 34
mosque 1 161 34
or 1 161 34
Islamic 1 161 34
school 1 161 34
in 1 161 34
the 1 161 34
United 1 161 34
States 1 161 34
that 1 161 34
teaches 1 161 34
young 1 161 34
Muslims 1 161 34
why 1 161 34
they 1 161 34
should 1 161 34
reject 1 161 34
the 1 161 34
understanding 1 161 34
of 1 161 34
Islam 1 161 34
taught 1 161 34
by 1 161 34

and 1 161 34
other 1 161 34
jihad 1 161 34
terror 1 161 34
groups. 1 161 34

Meanwhile, 0 161 35
Said 0 161 35
Khecharem 0 161 35
and 0 161 35
other 0 161 35
Islamic 0 161 35
spokesmen 0 161 35
openly 0 161 35
call 0 161 35
for 0 161 35
Muslims 0 161 35
to 0 161 35
engage 0 161 35
in 0 161 35
jihad 0 161 35
conquest. 0 161 35

Western 0 161 36
authorities 0 161 36
should 0 161 36
be 0 161 36
pondering 0 161 36
his 0 161 36
words, 0 161 36
and 0 161 36
their 0 161 36
implications, 0 161 36
very 0 161 36
carefully. 0 161 36

Instead, 0 161 37
if 0 161 37
they 0 161 37
have 0 161 37
taken 0 161 37
any 0 161 37
notice 0 161 37
of 0 161 37
him 0 161 37
at 0 161 37
all, 0 161 37
which 0 161 37
is 0 161 37
unlikely, 0 161 37
they 0 161 37
have 0 161 37
dismissed 0 161 37
him 0 161 37
as 0 161 37
an 1 161 37
“extremist.” 1 161 37

They 1 161 38
have 1 161 38
yet 1 161 38
to 1 161 38
come 1 161 38
to 1 161 38
grips 1 161 38
with 1 161 38
the 1 161 38
fact 1 161 38
that 1 161 38
“extremism” 1 161 38
is 1 161 38
and 1 161 38
always 1 161 38
has 1 161 38
been 1 161 38
so 1 161 38
distressingly 1 161 38
widespread 1 161 38
in 1 161 38
Muslim 1 161 38
communities. 1 161 38

the 0 167 63

had 0 167 63
once 0 167 63

“Over 0 167 63

Pamela 0 167 64

also 0 167 64
pointed 0 167 64
out 0 167 64
why 0 167 64

not 0 167 64

is 0 167 65
a 0 167 65
deep 0 167 65
part 0 167 65
of 0 167 65
the 0 167 65
Republican 0 167 65
establishment. 0 167 65

She 0 167 66
is 0 167 66
part 0 167 66
of 0 167 66
the 0 167 66
swamp, 0 167 66
part 0 167 66
of 0 167 66
the 0 167 66
willfully 1 167 66
ignorant 1 167 66
McMaster 0 167 66
crowd 0 167 66
that 0 167 66
clearly 0 167 66

Back 0 167 67
in 0 167 67
2017, 0 167 67

whose 0 167 67
failed 0 167 67
views 0 167 67
she 0 167 67
shared. 0 167 67

McMaster 0 167 68
subscribed 0 167 68
to 0 167 68
the 0 167 68
Obama 0 167 68
view 0 167 68
that 0 167 68

nothing 0 167 68
to 0 167 68
do 0 167 68
with 0 167 68
Islam, 0 167 68
despite 0 167 68
the 0 167 68
numerous 0 167 68
Islamic 0 167 68
texts 0 167 68
and 0 167 68
teachings 0 167 68
that 0 167 68

to 0 167 68

war 0 167 68
against 0 167 68

McMaster 0 167 69
went 0 167 69
so 0 167 69
far 0 167 69
as 0 167 69
to 0 167 69
claim 0 167 69
that 0 167 69
devout 0 167 69

were 0 167 69
“irreligious.” 0 167 69

former 0 167 70

Again, 1 167 71
and 1 167 71
I 1 167 71
have 1 167 71
asked 1 167 71
this 1 167 71
before, 1 167 71
how 1 167 71
do 1 167 71
you 1 167 71
fight 1 167 71
the 1 167 71
Deep 1 167 71
State 1 167 71
by 1 167 71
putting 1 167 71
Deep 1 167 71
State 1 167 71
operatives 1 167 71
in 1 167 71
these 1 167 71
positions? 1 167 71

How 1 167 72
do 1 167 72
you 1 167 72
drain 1 167 72
the 1 167 72
swamp 1 167 72
by 1 167 72
adding 1 167 72
to 1 167 72
it? 1 167 72

The 0 167 73
answer 0 167 73
is 0 167 73
clear: 0 167 73
You 0 167 73
don't. 0 167 73

This 0 167 74
would 0 167 74
actually 0 167 74
be 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
perfect 0 167 74
time 0 167 74
for 0 167 74
Trump 0 167 74
not 0 167 74
to 0 167 74
appoint 0 167 74
an 0 167 74
ambassador 0 167 74
to 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
UN 0 167 74
and 0 167 74
call 0 167 74
for 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
US 0 167 74
to 0 167 74
exit 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
anti-American 1 167 74
organization 0 167 74
and 0 167 74
demand 0 167 74
Congress 0 167 74
stop 0 167 74
funding 0 167 74
it 0 167 74
and 0 167 74
evict 0 167 74
the 0 167 74
UN 0 167 74
from 0 167 74
US 0 167 74
soil, 0 167 74
but 0 167 74
I'm 0 167 74
not 0 167 74
holding 0 167 74
my 0 167 74
breath. 0 167 74

However, 0 173 2
in 0 173 2
the 0 173 2
same 0 173 2
breath 0 173 2
that 0 173 2
she 0 173 2
ended 0 173 2
the 0 173 2
challenges, 0 173 2
she 0 173 2
also 0 173 2
declared 0 173 2
she 0 173 2

called 0 173 2
"gross 1 173 2
mismanagement" 1 173 2
of 0 173 2

If 1 173 3
you 1 173 3
ask 1 173 3
me, 1 173 3
all 1 173 3
she's 1 173 3
looking 1 173 3
for 1 173 3
here 1 173 3

only 1 173 3

Stacey 0 173 19
Abrams 0 173 19
ended 0 173 19
her 0 173 19
run 0 173 19
for 0 173 19
Georgia 0 173 19
governor 0 173 19
on 0 173 19
Friday, 0 173 19
but 0 173 19
the 0 173 19
Democrat 0 173 19
said 0 173 19
she 0 173 19
would 0 173 19
not 0 173 19

the 0 173 19

officials 0 173 20
prepare 0 173 20
to 0 173 20
certify 0 173 20
the 0 173 20

Abrams 0 173 20
acknowledged 0 173 20
the 0 173 20
law 0 173 20
“allows 0 173 20
no 0 173 20
further 0 173 20

nation’s 0 173 20
first 0 173 20
black 0 173 20
female 0 173 20
governor. 0 173 20

But 0 173 21
she 0 173 21
laced 0 173 21
her 0 173 21
speech 0 173 21
with 0 173 21
biting 0 173 21
criticism 0 173 21
of 0 173 21
Kemp, 0 173 21
who 0 173 21
she 0 173 21
accused 0 173 21
of 0 173 21
leveraging 0 173 21
his 0 173 21
role 0 173 21
as 0 173 21
the 0 173 21
state’s 0 173 21
top 0 173 21
elections 0 173 21
official 0 173 21
to 0 173 21

voters. 0 173 21

“I 0 173 22
will 0 173 22
not 0 173 22
concede,” 0 173 22
she 0 173 22
added, 0 173 22
“because 0 173 22
the 0 173 22
erosion 0 173 22
of 0 173 22
our 0 173 22
democracy 0 173 22
is 0 173 22
not 0 173 22
right.” 0 173 22

You 1 173 23
mean 1 173 23
like 1 173 23
having 1 173 23
a 1 173 23

any 1 173 23
campaign 1 173 23

Ms. 1 173 23
Abrams? 1 173 23

What 1 173 24
about 1 173 24
invalid 1 173 24
provisional 1 173 24
ballots 1 173 24
getting 1 173 24
mixed 1 173 24

a 1 173 25
little 1 173 25
electronic 1 173 25
voter 1 173 25
manipulation, 1 173 25
Ms. 1 173 25
Abrams? 1 173 25

How 1 173 26
about 1 173 26
non-citizens 1 173 26

Ms. 1 173 26
Abrams? 1 173 26

Are 0 173 27
these 0 173 27

of 0 173 27
the 0 173 27

Sure 0 173 28
they 0 173 28
are 0 173 28

they 0 173 28

going 0 173 28
to 0 173 28
talk 0 173 28
about 0 173 28
that. 0 173 28

But 0 173 29
she 0 173 29
wasn't 0 173 29
going 0 173 29
to 0 173 29
concede. 0 173 29

Nope, 0 173 30
that 0 173 30
arrogant 0 173 30
wanna-be 0 173 30
first 0 173 30
female 0 173 30
governor 0 173 30
of 0 173 30
Georgia 0 173 30
simply 0 173 30
would 0 173 30
not 0 173 30
bow 0 173 30
out 0 173 30
gracefully. 0 173 30

“To 0 173 31
watch 0 173 31
an 0 173 31
elected 0 173 31
official 0 173 31
who 0 173 31
claims 0 173 31
to 0 173 31
represent 0 173 31
the 0 173 31
people 0 173 31
in 0 173 31
this 0 173 31
state 0 173 31
baldly 1 173 31
pin 1 173 31
his 1 173 31
hopes 1 173 31
for 0 173 31
election 0 173 31
on 0 173 31
the 0 173 31
suppression 0 173 31
of 0 173 31
the 0 173 31
people’s 0 173 31
democratic 0 173 31
right 0 173 31
to 0 173 31
vote 0 173 31
has 0 173 31
been 0 173 31
truly 0 173 31
appalling,” 0 173 31
Abrams 0 173 31
said. 0 173 31

“So, 0 173 32
let’s 0 173 32
be 0 173 32
clear," 0 173 32
she 0 173 32
continued. 0 173 32

"This 0 173 33
is 0 173 33
not 0 173 33
a 0 173 33
speech 0 173 33
of 0 173 33
concession. 0 173 33

Because 0 173 34
concession 0 173 34
means 0 173 34
to 0 173 34
acknowledge 0 173 34
an 0 173 34
action 0 173 34
is 0 173 34
right, 0 173 34
true 0 173 34
or 0 173 34
proper. 0 173 34

As 0 173 35
a 0 173 35
woman 0 173 35
of 0 173 35
conscience 0 173 35
and 0 173 35
faith, 0 173 35
I 0 173 35
cannot 0 173 35
concede 0 173 35
that. 0 173 35

But 0 173 36
my 0 173 36
assessment 0 173 36
is 0 173 36
the 0 173 36
law 0 173 36
currently 0 173 36
allows 0 173 36
no 0 173 36
further 0 173 36
viable 0 173 36
remedy.” 0 173 36

No, 0 173 37
concession 0 173 37
means 0 173 37
"a 0 173 37
thing 0 173 37
that 0 173 37
is 0 173 37
granted, 0 173 37
especially 0 173 37
in 0 173 37
response 0 173 37
to 0 173 37
demands; 0 173 37
a 0 173 37
thing 0 173 37
conceded." 0 173 37

Abrams 0 173 38
was 0 173 38
easily 0 173 38
defeated 0 173 38
in 0 173 38
terms 0 173 38
of 0 173 38
votes. 0 173 38

She 0 173 39
was 0 173 39
the 0 173 39

trying 0 173 39

She 0 173 40
is 0 173 40
the 0 173 40
one 0 173 40
claiming 0 173 40
there 0 173 40
was 0 173 40

She 0 173 42
has 0 173 42
none. 0 173 42

Stacey 0 173 43

a 0 173 43

she 0 173 43

she 0 173 43

claimed 0 176 29
to 0 176 29
be 0 176 29
trying 0 176 29
to 0 176 29
expose 0 176 29

who 0 176 29
were 0 176 29
the 0 176 29
subject 0 176 29
of 0 176 29
a 0 176 29
rape 0 176 29
trial. 0 176 29

So, 0 176 30
expose 1 176 30
the 1 176 30
Islamists 1 176 30
fro 1 176 30
who 1 176 30
and 1 176 30
what 1 176 30
they 1 176 30
are 1 176 30
and 1 176 30
what 1 176 30
Islam's 1 176 30
founder 1 176 30
not 1 176 30
only 1 176 30
taught 1 176 30
them, 1 176 30
but 1 176 30
modeled 1 176 30
for 1 176 30
them, 1 176 30
and 0 176 30
you 0 176 30
may 0 176 30
just 0 176 30
find 0 176 30
yourself 0 176 30
in 0 176 30
jail 0 176 30
in 0 176 30

UK. 0 176 30

Sadly, 0 176 31
the 0 176 31
same 0 176 31
scenario 0 176 31
is 0 176 31
making 0 176 31
some 0 176 31

"disgrace." 1 176 33

and 0 176 36
sentenced 0 176 36
within 0 176 36
five 0 176 36

Such 1 176 38
measures 1 176 38

exactly 0 178 14
when 0 178 14

happened, 0 178 14
but 0 178 14
suspect 0 178 14
it 0 178 14
took 0 178 14

that 0 178 19
slowly 0 178 19

surely 0 178 19

pulls 0 178 19

the 0 178 19

like 0 178 19

House 0 181 23
press 0 181 23
secretary 0 181 23
Sarah 0 181 23
Sanders 0 181 23
made 0 181 23
the 0 181 23
announcement 0 181 23
that 0 181 23
Acosta’s 0 181 23
press 0 181 23
pass 0 181 23
had 0 181 23
been 0 181 23
suspended 0 181 23
as 0 181 23
a 0 181 23
result 0 181 23
of 0 181 23
a 0 181 23
tussle 0 181 23
with 0 181 23
a 0 181 23
White 0 181 23
House 0 181 23
intern 0 181 23
over 0 181 23
a 0 181 23
microphone 0 181 23
following 0 181 23
his 0 181 23
sharp 1 181 23
back-and-forth 0 181 23
with 0 181 23
Trump 0 181 23
during 0 181 23
the 0 181 23
President’s 0 181 23
post-midterm 0 181 23
Q&A. 0 181 23

Acosta 0 181 24
has 0 181 24
disputed 0 181 24
the 0 181 24
accusation 0 181 24
claiming 0 181 24
he 0 181 24
never 0 181 24
put 0 181 24
his 0 181 24
hands 0 181 24
on 0 181 24
the 0 181 24
young 0 181 24
woman. 0 181 24

Watching 0 181 25
the 0 181 25
full 0 181 25
exchange 0 181 25
it 0 181 25
is 0 181 25
obvious 0 181 25
that 0 181 25
President 0 181 25
Trump 0 181 25
was 0 181 25
making 0 181 25
a 0 181 25
sincere 1 181 25
effort 0 181 25
to 0 181 25
answer 0 181 25
Acosta’s 0 181 25
questions, 0 181 25
the 0 181 25
president 0 181 25
actually 0 181 25
took 0 181 25
the 0 181 25
time 0 181 25
to 0 181 25
answer 0 181 25
three 0 181 25
of 0 181 25
his 0 181 25
questions 0 181 25
before 0 181 25
rightfully 1 181 25
losing 0 181 25
his 0 181 25
patients 0 181 25
when 0 181 25
Acosta 0 181 25
refused 0 181 25
to 0 181 25
hand 0 181 25
the 0 181 25
mic 0 181 25
over. 0 181 25

Not 0 181 26
only 0 181 26
that, 0 181 26
he 0 181 26
used 0 181 26
his 0 181 26
hand 0 181 26
to 0 181 26
forcefully 1 181 26
push 0 181 26
the 0 181 26
female 0 181 26
interns 0 181 26
arm 0 181 26
away 0 181 26
from 0 181 26
the 0 181 26
mic. 0 181 26

Acosta 0 181 27
should 0 181 27
have 0 181 27
been 0 181 27
escorted 0 181 27
from 0 181 27
the 0 181 27
room. 0 181 27

He 0 181 28
deserved 0 181 28
to 0 181 28
have 0 181 28
his 0 181 28
credentials 0 181 28
revoked. 0 181 28

I'll 0 183 0
Say 0 183 0
What 0 183 0
Kavanaugh 0 183 0
Wouldn't: 0 183 0
Christine 0 183 0
Ford 0 183 0
Was 0 183 0
Part 0 183 0
Of 0 183 0
The 0 183 0
Political 0 183 0
Hit 0 183 0
On 0 183 0
Him 0 183 0
& 0 183 0
Here's 0 183 0
The 0 183 0
Audio 0 183 0
Evidence 0 183 0

On 0 183 1
Thursday, 0 183 1
following 0 183 1
the 0 183 1
hearings 0 183 1
where 0 183 1
Dr. 0 183 1
Christine 0 183 1
Ford 0 183 1
provided 0 183 1
testimony 0 183 1
under 0 183 1
oath 0 183 1
without 0 183 1
any 0 183 1
evidence 0 183 1
at 0 183 1
all 0 183 1
of 0 183 1
a 0 183 1
36-year-old 0 183 1
alleged 0 183 1
sexual 0 183 1
attack 0 183 1
by 0 183 1
Supreme 0 183 1
Court 0 183 1
nominee 0 183 1
Brett 0 183 1
Kavanaugh 0 183 1
and 0 183 1
his 0 183 1
friend 0 183 1
Mark 0 183 1
Judge, 0 183 1
Kavanaugh 0 183 1
denied 0 183 1
the 0 183 1
allegations 0 183 1
and 0 183 1
blasted 1 183 1
Senate 1 183 1
Democrats 1 183 1
for 0 183 1
their 0 183 1
involvement 0 183 1
in 0 183 1
ruining 0 183 1
his 0 183 1
good 0 183 1
name. 0 183 1

However, 0 183 2
when 0 183 2
asked 0 183 2
by 0 183 2
Senator 0 183 2
Cory 0 183 2
Booker 0 183 2
whether 0 183 2
or 0 183 2
not 0 183 2
Kavanaugh 0 183 2
thought 0 183 2
Ford 0 183 2
was 0 183 2
part 0 183 2
of 0 183 2
what 0 183 2
Kavanaugh 0 183 2
referred 0 183 2
to 0 183 2
as 0 183 2
a 0 183 2
"political 1 183 2
hit" 1 183 2
against 0 183 2
him, 0 183 2
Kavanaugh 0 183 2
rightly 0 183 2
steered 0 183 2
clear 0 183 2
of 0 183 2
a 0 183 2
public 1 183 2
relations 1 183 2
disaster. 1 183 2

However, 0 183 3
I 0 183 3
am 0 183 3
willing 0 183 3
to 0 183 3
say 0 183 3
would 0 183 3
he 0 183 3
would 0 183 3
not: 0 183 3
Of 1 183 3
course, 1 183 3
she 1 183 3
was 1 183 3
part 1 183 3
of 1 183 3
it! 1 183 3

I 0 183 4
don't 0 183 4
say 0 183 4
this 0 183 4
lightly. 0 183 4

There 0 183 5
are 0 183 5
many 0 183 5
things 0 183 5
that 0 183 5
we 0 183 5
heard 0 183 5
from 0 183 5
Ford 0 183 5
on 0 183 5
Thursday 0 183 5
that 0 183 5
indicate 0 183 5
there 0 183 5
is 0 183 5
more 0 183 5
going 0 183 5
on 0 183 5
than 0 183 5
she 0 183 5
was 0 183 5
willing 0 183 5
to 0 183 5
say. 0 183 5

Clearly, 0 183 6
Ford 0 183 6
has 0 183 6
been 0 183 6
outed 0 183 6
as 0 183 6
a 1 183 6
radical 1 183 6
political 1 183 6
activist 1 183 6
who 1 183 6
promotes 1 183 6
baby 1 183 6
murder 1 183 6
and 1 183 6
other 1 183 6
unlawful 1 183 6
actions. 1 183 6

However, 0 183 7
her 1 183 7
story 1 183 7
didn't 1 183 7
exactly 1 183 7
lend 1 183 7
credibility 1 183 7
except 0 183 7
with 0 183 7
Democrat 0 183 7
members 0 183 7
of 0 183 7
the 0 183 7
Senate 0 183 7
Judiciary 0 183 7
Committee, 0 183 7
one 0 183 7
of 0 183 7
which 0 183 7
has 0 183 7
openly 0 183 7
professed 0 183 7
to 0 183 7
sexual 0 183 7
assault. 0 183 7

However, 0 183 18
Ford 0 183 18
claims 0 183 18
she 0 183 18
never 0 183 18
authorized 0 183 18
her 0 183 18
July 0 183 18

Senator 0 183 18

to 0 183 18

public 0 183 18
and 0 183 18
yet, 0 183 18
it 0 183 18
was. 0 183 18

She 0 183 19
didn't 0 183 19
seem 0 183 19

over 0 183 19
that. 0 183 19

wasn't 1 183 20
angry 1 183 20
it 1 183 20
was 1 183 20
made 1 183 20
public. 1 183 20

Why? 1 183 21

She 1 183 22
knew 1 183 22
it 1 183 22
would 1 183 22
be 1 183 22
made 1 183 22

Ricki 0 183 23
Seidman, 0 183 23
a 0 183 23
Democratic 0 183 23
operative 0 183 23
and 0 183 23
former 0 183 23
Clinton 0 183 23
White 0 183 23
House 0 183 23
official 0 183 23
who 0 183 23
is 0 183 23
now 0 183 23
an 0 183 23
advisor 0 183 23
to 0 183 23
Mrs. 0 183 23
Ford, 0 183 23
said 0 183 23
in 0 183 23
July 0 183 23
(at 0 183 23
roughly 0 183 23
the 0 183 23
same 0 183 23
time 0 183 23
as 0 183 23
the 0 183 23
letter 0 183 23
was 0 183 23
submitted) 0 183 23
that 0 183 23
she 0 183 23
predicted 0 183 23
a 0 183 23
"strategy" 0 183 23
forming 0 183 23
to 1 183 23
destroy 1 183 23
Brett 1 183 23
Kavanaugh. 1 183 23

She 0 183 24
suggested 0 183 24
a 0 183 24
“strategy 0 183 24
will 0 183 24
emerge” 0 183 24
to 1 183 24
destroy 1 183 24
Trump's 1 183 24
nomination 1 183 24
for 1 183 24
the 1 183 24
Supreme 1 183 24
Court 1 183 24
in 0 183 24
a 0 183 24
conference 0 183 24
call 0 183 24
with 0 183 24
the 0 183 24
American 0 183 24
Constitution 0 183 24
Society 0 183 24
in 0 183 24
July. 0 183 24

“I 0 183 25
do 0 183 25
think 0 183 25
that 0 183 25
over 0 183 25
the 0 183 25
coming 0 183 25
days 0 183 25
and 0 183 25
weeks 0 183 25
there 0 183 25
will 0 183 25
be 0 183 25
a 0 183 25
strategy 0 183 25
that 0 183 25
will 0 183 25
emerge, 0 183 25
and 0 183 25
I 0 183 25
think 0 183 25
it’s 0 183 25
possible 0 183 25
that 0 183 25
strategy 0 183 25
might 0 183 25
ultimately 0 183 25
defeat 0 183 25
the 0 183 25
nominee,” 0 183 25
Seidman 0 183 25
said 0 183 25
in 0 183 25
audio 0 183 25
that 0 183 25
was 0 183 25
recorded 0 183 25
by 0 183 25
the 0 183 25
Republican 0 183 25
National 0 183 25
Committee’s 0 183 25
War 0 183 25
Room. 0 183 25

“And 1 183 26
whether 1 183 26
or 1 183 26
not 1 183 26
it 1 183 26
ultimately 1 183 26
defeats 1 183 26
the 1 183 26
nominee 1 183 26
it 1 183 26
will, 1 183 26
I 1 183 26
think, 1 183 26
help 1 183 26
people 1 183 26
understand 1 183 26
why 1 183 26
it’s 1 183 26
so 1 183 26
important 1 183 26
that 1 183 26
they 1 183 26
vote.” 1 183 26

If 1 183 27
you 1 183 27
think 1 183 27
Mrs. 1 183 27
Ford 1 183 27
is 1 183 27
ignorant 1 183 27
of 1 183 27
this 1 183 27
considering 1 183 27
her 1 183 27
father 1 183 27
works 1 183 27
for 1 183 27
the 1 183 27
Central 1 183 27
Intelligence 1 183 27
Agency 1 183 27
and 1 183 27
her 1 183 27
prior 1 183 27
criminal 1 183 27
political 1 183 27
activism, 1 183 27
then 1 183 27
you 1 183 27
aren't 1 183 27
thinking 1 183 27
clearly. 1 183 27

Ford 1 183 28
obviously 1 183 28
has 1 183 28
mental 1 183 28
issues 1 183 28
and 1 183 28
that 1 183 28
was 1 183 28
on 1 183 28
display 1 183 28
on 1 183 28
Thursday 1 183 28
during 1 183 28
her 1 183 28
testimony. 1 183 28

She 0 183 29
clearly 0 183 29
tried 0 183 29
to 0 183 29
present 0 183 29
herself 0 183 29
as 0 183 29
a 0 183 29
victim 0 183 29
while 0 183 29
she 0 183 29
accused 0 183 29
Kavanaugh 0 183 29
of 0 183 29
sexual 0 183 29
assault 0 183 29
with 0 183 29
absolutely 1 183 29
no 1 183 29
evidence. 1 183 29

Kavanaugh 0 183 30
even 0 183 30
responded 0 183 30
by 0 183 30
pointing 0 183 30
out 0 183 30
that 0 183 30
even 0 183 30
her 0 183 30
friends 0 183 30
said 0 183 30
they 0 183 30
don't 0 183 30
recall 0 183 30
such 0 183 30
an 0 183 30
incident 0 183 30
and 0 183 30
had 0 183 30
literally 0 183 30
hundreds 0 183 30
of 0 183 30
people 0 183 30
commend 0 183 30
his 0 183 30
character 0 183 30
as 0 183 30
the 0 183 30
direct 0 183 30
opposite 0 183 30
of 0 183 30
what 0 183 30
Ford 0 183 30
claims. 0 183 30

As 0 183 31
I've 0 183 31
said 0 183 31
before, 0 183 31
I 0 183 31
don't 0 183 31
support 0 183 31
Kavanaugh's 0 183 31
appointment 0 183 31
to 0 183 31
the 0 183 31
Supreme 0 183 31
Court 0 183 31
on 0 183 31
the 0 183 31
grounds 0 183 31
of 0 183 31
lack 0 183 31
of 0 183 31
constitutional 0 183 31
rulings, 0 183 31
but 0 183 31
that 1 183 31
attack 1 183 31
on 1 183 31
him 1 183 31
was 1 183 31
orchestrated, 1 183 31
it 1 183 31
was 1 183 31
political 1 183 31
and 1 183 31
Ford 1 183 31
was 1 183 31
a 1 183 31
part 1 183 31
of 1 183 31
it. 1 183 31

It's 0 183 32
wrong. 0 183 32

Ford 0 183 33
didn't 0 183 33
even 0 183 33
think 0 183 33
to 0 183 33
act, 0 183 33
according 0 183 33
to 0 183 33
her 0 183 33
testimony, 0 183 33
until 0 183 33
Kavanaugh 0 183 33
was 0 183 33
on 0 183 33
the 0 183 33
short 0 183 33
list, 0 183 33
but 1 183 33
did 1 183 33
she 1 183 33
go 1 183 33
to 1 183 33
local 1 183 33
law 1 183 33
enforcement? 1 183 33

Nope. 0 183 34

She 0 183 35
went 0 183 35
to 0 183 35
her 0 183 35
US 0 183 35
Democrat 0 183 35
representative, 0 183 35

Feinstein 0 183 35
and 0 183 35
The 0 183 35
Washington 0 183 35
Post. 0 183 35

If 0 183 36
that 0 183 36
is 0 183 36
not 0 183 36
political, 0 183 36
I 0 183 36
don't 0 183 36
know 0 183 36
what 0 183 36
is. 0 183 36

Ford 1 183 37
is 1 183 37
not 1 183 37
seeking 1 183 37
justice 1 183 37
nor 1 183 37
is 1 183 37
she 1 183 37
seeking 1 183 37
to 1 183 37
do 1 183 37
her 1 183 37
"civic 1 183 37
duty." 1 183 37

She 1 183 38
is 1 183 38
seeking 1 183 38
to 1 183 38
slander 1 183 38
a 1 183 38
man's 1 183 38
character 1 183 38
for 1 183 38
something 1 183 38
she 1 183 38
cannot 1 183 38
prove 1 183 38
that 1 183 38
she 1 183 38
claims 1 183 38
happened 1 183 38
over 1 183 38

back 0 191 1
in 0 191 1

was 0 191 1
clearly 0 191 1
already 0 191 1

I 0 191 2
never 0 191 2
thought 0 191 2
I’d 0 191 2
see 0 191 2
the 0 191 2
day 0 191 2
when 0 191 2
a 1 191 2
preening, 1 191 2
Internet-created 1 191 2

doyenne 1 191 2

often 1 191 2
unprintable 1 191 2
invective 1 191 2
against 0 191 2
traditionalists, 0 191 2
would 0 191 2
unload 1 191 2
on 1 191 2
Pope 1 191 2
Bergoglio 1 191 2
with 0 191 2
the 0 191 2
following 0 191 2
headline: 0 191 2
“Does 1 191 2
Francis 1 191 2
know 1 191 2

The 0 191 3
scales 0 191 3
have 0 191 3
fallen 0 191 3
from 0 191 3
Fisher’s 0 191 3
eyes 0 191 3
and 0 191 3
now, 0 191 3
at 0 191 3
last, 0 191 3
she 0 191 3
sees 0 191 3
Bergoglio, 0 191 3
however 0 191 3
grudgingly, 0 191 3
for 0 191 3
what 0 191 3
he 0 191 3
is: 0 191 3
a 1 191 3
power-mad 1 191 3
ecclesiastical 1 191 3
tyrant. 1 191 3

(A 0 191 4
tyrant, 0 191 4
moreover, 0 191 4
who 0 191 4
has 0 191 4
ascended 0 191 4
to 0 191 4
the 0 191 4
papacy 0 191 4
in 0 191 4
a 0 191 4
manner 0 191 4
reminiscent 0 191 4
of 0 191 4
the 0 191 4
ascension 0 191 4

of 0 191 4
a 0 191 4

as 0 191 4
I 0 191 4
discuss 0 191 4
below.) 0 191 4

Quoth 0 191 5
Fisher: 0 191 5

I 0 191 6
have 0 191 6
a 0 191 6
number 0 191 6
of 0 191 6
friends 0 191 6
who 0 191 6
have 0 191 6
escaped 0 191 6
abusive 0 191 6
marriages. 0 191 6

They 0 191 7
tell 0 191 7
me 0 191 7
that 0 191 7
Pope 1 191 7
Francis 1 191 7
is 1 191 7
sounding 1 191 7
more 1 191 7
and 1 191 7
more 1 191 7
like 1 191 7
the 1 191 7
men 1 191 7
who 1 191 7
abused 1 191 7
them. 1 191 7

He’s 1 191 8
sounding 1 191 8
like 1 191 8
the 1 191 8
men 1 191 8
who 1 191 8
hid 1 191 8
that 1 191 8
abuse 1 191 8
from 1 191 8
the 1 191 8
world, 1 191 8
who 1 191 8
taught 1 191 8
their 1 191 8
victims 1 191 8
to 1 191 8
blame 1 191 8
themselves, 1 191 8
who 1 191 8
used 1 191 8
spiritual 1 191 8
pressure 1 191 8
to 1 191 8
persuade 1 191 8
them 1 191 8
and 1 191 8
their 1 191 8
families 1 191 8
that 1 191 8
it 1 191 8
would 1 191 8
actually 1 191 8
be 1 191 8
wrong, 1 191 8
sinful, 1 191 8
to 1 191 8
defend 1 191 8
themselves. 1 191 8

Just 0 191 9
listen 0 191 9
to 0 191 9
him. 0 191 9

After 0 191 10
responding 0 191 10
to 0 191 10
a 0 191 10
question 0 191 10
about 0 191 10
Vigano’s 0 191 10
very 0 191 10
serious 0 191 10
accusations, 0 191 10
he 0 191 10
said 0 191 10
point 0 191 10
blank, 0 191 10
“I 0 191 10
will 0 191 10
not 0 191 10
say 0 191 10
a 0 191 10
single 0 191 10
word 0 191 10
on 0 191 10
this.”… 0 191 10
[F]or 0 191 10
the 0 191 10
rest 0 191 10
of 0 191 10
the 0 191 10
week 0 191 10
and 0 191 10
more, 0 191 10
he 0 191 10
kept 0 191 10
up 0 191 10
an 0 191 10
unmistakable 0 191 10
theme 0 191 10
of 0 191 10
calling 0 191 10
for 0 191 10
silence, 0 191 10
equating 0 191 10
silence 0 191 10
with 0 191 10
holiness, 0 191 10
and 0 191 10
painting 0 191 10
himself 0 191 10
as 0 191 10
a 1 191 10
Christlike 1 191 10
victim 1 191 10
in 0 191 10
his 0 191 10
silence. 0 191 10

Then 0 191 11
he 0 191 11
says 0 191 11
it’s 0 191 11
“ugly” 0 191 11
to 0 191 11
accuse 0 191 11
others 0 191 11
of 0 191 11
sinning. 0 191 11

Then 0 191 12
he 0 191 12
suggests 0 191 12
that 0 191 12
healing 1 191 12
and 1 191 12
reconciliation 1 191 12
will 1 191 12
only 1 191 12
come 1 191 12
if 1 191 12
we 1 191 12
take 1 191 12
a 1 191 12
hard 1 191 12
look 1 191 12
at 1 191 12
our 1 191 12
own 1 191 12
flaws…. 1 191 12

To 1 191 13
the 1 191 13
victims 1 191 13
of 1 191 13
the 1 191 13
Church, 1 191 13
and 1 191 13
to 1 191 13
those 1 191 13
who 1 191 13
love 1 191 13
them, 1 191 13
it 1 191 13
sounds 1 191 13
like 1 191 13
he 1 191 13
is 1 191 13
saying, 1 191 13
“Who 1 191 13
do 1 191 13
you 1 191 13
think 1 191 13
you 1 191 13
are? 1 191 13

I 1 191 14
don’t 1 191 14
have 1 191 14
to 1 191 14
explain 1 191 14
myself 1 191 14
to 1 191 14
you. 1 191 14

You’re 1 191 15
the 1 191 15
guilty 1 191 15
one. 1 191 15

You 1 191 16
brought 1 191 16
this 1 191 16
on 1 191 16
yourself. 1 191 16

If 1 191 17
you 1 191 17
want 1 191 17
to 1 191 17
be 1 191 17
loved, 1 191 17
then 1 191 17
know 1 191 17
your 1 191 17
place. 1 191 17

I’m 1 191 18
the 1 191 18
victim, 1 191 18
here, 1 191 18
not 1 191 18
you. 1 191 18

If 1 191 19
you 1 191 19
know 1 191 19
what’s 1 191 19
good 1 191 19
for 1 191 19
you, 1 191 19
keep 1 191 19
your 1 191 19
mouth 1 191 19
shut.” 1 191 19
This 1 191 19
is 1 191 19
how 1 191 19
abusers 1 191 19
talk. 1 191 19

They’re 1 191 20
not 1 191 20
content 1 191 20
with 1 191 20
power; 1 191 20
they 1 191 20
have 1 191 20
to 1 191 20
keep 1 191 20
their 1 191 20
victims 1 191 20
doubting 1 191 20
and 1 191 20
blaming 1 191 20
themselves 1 191 20
constantly, 1 191 20
so 1 191 20
they 1 191 20
don’t 1 191 20
become 1 191 20
a 1 191 20
threat. 1 191 20

Whether 1 191 21
Francis 1 191 21
knows 1 191 21
it 1 191 21
or 1 191 21
not, 1 191 21
this 1 191 21
is 1 191 21
how 1 191 21
he 1 191 21
sounds. 1 191 21

We 0 191 22
can 0 191 22
overlook 0 191 22
the 0 191 22
fig 0 191 22
leaf 0 191 22
“whether 0 191 22
Francis 0 191 22
knows 0 191 22
it 0 191 22
or 0 191 22
not…”. 0 191 22

Fisher 1 191 23
knows 1 191 23
that 1 191 23
Francis 1 191 23
knows 1 191 23
it, 1 191 23
even 1 191 23
if 1 191 23
she 1 191 23
still 1 191 23
cannot 1 191 23
bring 1 191 23
herself 1 191 23
to 1 191 23
say 1 191 23
explicitly 1 191 23
what 1 191 23
should 1 191 23
now 1 191 23
be 1 191 23
apparent 1 191 23
to 1 191 23
the 1 191 23
entire 1 191 23
body 1 191 23
of 1 191 23
the 1 191 23
faithful: 1 191 23
that 0 191 23
Bergoglio’s 1 191 23
very 1 191 23
presence 1 191 23
on 1 191 23
the 1 191 23
Chair 1 191 23
of 1 191 23
Peter 1 191 23
is 1 191 23
a 1 191 23
grave 1 191 23
threat 1 191 23
to 1 191 23
the 1 191 23

Yet 0 191 25
Fisher 0 191 25
maintains 0 191 25
a 0 191 25
sliver 0 191 25
of 0 191 25
space 0 191 25
for 0 191 25
deniability 0 191 25
in 0 191 25
order 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
maintain 0 191 25
that 0 191 25
indispensable 0 191 25
distinction 0 191 25
between 0 191 25
her 0 191 25
and 0 191 25
those 1 191 25
loathsome 1 191 25
traditionalists: 1 191 25
“I 0 191 25
don’t 0 191 25
have 0 191 25
any 0 191 25
ideological 0 191 25
reason 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
want 0 191 25
to 0 191 25
bring 0 191 25
him 0 191 25
down. 0 191 25

I 0 191 26
have 0 191 26
defended 0 191 26
him 0 191 26
as 0 191 26
long 0 191 26
as 0 191 26
I 0 191 26
could, 0 191 26
up 0 191 26
until 0 191 26
the 0 191 26
Chile 0 191 26
debacle. 0 191 26

And 0 191 27
so 0 191 27
I 0 191 27
am 0 191 27
working 0 191 27
as 0 191 27
hard 0 191 27
as 0 191 27
I 0 191 27
can 0 191 27
not 0 191 27
to 0 191 27
assume 0 191 27
the 0 191 27
worst, 0 191 27
not 0 191 27
to 0 191 27
believe 0 191 27
that 0 191 27
this 1 191 27
man 1 191 27
who 1 191 27
promised 1 191 27
so 1 191 27
much 1 191 27
fresh 1 191 27
air 1 191 27
is 1 191 27
really 1 191 27
so 1 191 27
intent 1 191 27
on 1 191 27
slamming 1 191 27
doors 1 191 27
shut 1 191 27
before 1 191 27
we 1 191 27
find 1 191 27
out 1 191 27
even 1 191 27
worse 1 191 27
things 1 191 27
hidden 1 191 27
inside. 1 191 27

But 1 191 28
he 1 191 28
is 1 191 28
not 1 191 28
making 1 191 28
it 1 191 28
easy. 1 191 28

I 1 191 29
am 1 191 29
not 1 191 29
saying 1 191 29
he 1 191 29
is 1 191 29
an 1 191 29
abuser. 1 191 29

But 1 191 30
he 1 191 30
sounds 1 191 30
like 1 191 30
one.” 1 191 30

That 0 191 31
is, 0 191 31
Fisher 0 191 31
was 0 191 31
not 0 191 31
concerned 0 191 31
about 0 191 31
Bergoglio’s 0 191 31
relentless 1 191 31
assault 1 191 31
on 0 191 31
traditional 0 191 31
Catholic 0 191 31
teaching 0 191 31
and 0 191 31
practice—to 0 191 31
her, 0 191 31
opposition 0 191 31
to 0 191 31
Francis 0 191 31
on 0 191 31
that 0 191 31
account 0 191 31
is 0 191 31
just 0 191 31
“ideology”—but 0 191 31
only 0 191 31
his 0 191 31
role 0 191 31
in 0 191 31
covering 0 191 31
up 0 191 31
sexual 0 191 31
abuse 0 191 31
by 0 191 31
bishops 0 191 31
and 0 191 31
priests. 0 191 31

But 0 191 32
why 0 191 32
is 0 191 32
Fisher 0 191 32
still 0 191 32
“working 0 191 32
hard 0 191 32
not 0 191 32
to 0 191 32
assume 0 191 32
the 0 191 32
worst” 0 191 32
when 0 191 32
there 0 191 32
is 0 191 32
no 0 191 32
longer 0 191 32
anything 0 191 32
to 0 191 32
assume 0 191 32
as 0 191 32
the 0 191 32
ever-mounting 0 191 32
evidence 0 191 32
of 0 191 32
malintent 0 191 32
has 0 191 32
been 0 191 32
in 0 191 32
plain 0 191 32
view 0 191 32
for 0 191 32
years? 0 191 32

Indeed, 0 191 33
why 0 191 33
else 0 191 33
did 0 191 33
Archbishop 0 191 33
Viganò 0 191 33
risk 1 191 33
everything 1 191 33
in 0 191 33
order 0 191 33
to 0 191 33
expose 0 191 33
this 0 191 33
Pope, 0 191 33
even 0 191 33
to 0 191 33
the 0 191 33
extent 0 191 33
of 0 191 33
revealing 0 191 33
matters 0 191 33
supposedly 0 191 33
within 0 191 33
the 0 191 33
scope 0 191 33
of 0 191 33
“the 0 191 33
Pontifical 0 191 33
secret”? 0 191 33

On 0 191 34
orders 0 191 34
of 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
Vatican 0 191 34
Secretary 0 191 34
of 0 191 34
State, 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
Vatican 0 191 34
secret 0 191 34
police 0 191 34
are 0 191 34
reportedly 0 191 34
scouring 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
globe 0 191 34
in 0 191 34
search 0 191 34
of 0 191 34
Viganò, 0 191 34
who 0 191 34
has 0 191 34
gone 0 191 34
into 0 191 34
hiding, 0 191 34
“in 0 191 34
order 0 191 34
to 0 191 34
prevent 0 191 34
more 0 191 34
unpredictable 0 191 34
damage 0 191 34
to 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
image 0 191 34
of 0 191 34
Pope 0 191 34
Francis 0 191 34
and 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
Holy 0 191 34
See 0 191 34
on 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
world 0 191 34
stage, 0 191 34
but 0 191 34
also 0 191 34
to 0 191 34
‘prepare 0 191 34
the 0 191 34
terrain’ 0 191 34
for 0 191 34
the 1 191 34
former 1 191 34

to 0 191 34
be 0 191 34
prosecuted” 0 191 34
under 0 191 34
canon 0 191 34
law. 0 191 34

The 1 191 35
Dictator 1 191 35
Pope 1 191 35
must 0 191 35
destroy 0 191 35
his 0 191 35
most 0 191 35
potent 0 191 35
critic 0 191 35
thus 0 191 35
far. 0 191 35

Everything 1 191 36
depends 1 191 36
on 1 191 36
it! 1 191 36

But 0 191 37
it 0 191 37
may 0 191 37
already 0 191 37
be 0 191 37
too 0 191 37
late 0 191 37
to 0 191 37
save 0 191 37
a 0 191 37
regime 0 191 37
whose 0 191 37
only 0 191 37
defense 0 191 37
is 0 191 37
not 0 191 37
truth 0 191 37
but 0 191 37
raw 0 191 37
power. 0 191 37

At 0 191 38
last 0 191 38
count, 0 191 38
some 0 191 38
29 0 191 38
bishops 0 191 38
have 0 191 38
publicly 0 191 38
declared 0 191 38
Viganò’s 0 191 38
allegations 0 191 38
against 0 191 38
Bergoglio 0 191 38
credible 0 191 38
and 0 191 38
worthy 0 191 38
of 0 191 38
investigation. 0 191 38

Now 0 191 39
even 0 191 39
the 0 191 39
distinguished 0 191 39
canonist 0 191 39
Edward 0 191 39
Peters, 0 191 39
who 0 191 39
is 0 191 39
no 0 191 39
less 0 191 39
than 0 191 39
a 0 191 39
Referendary 0 191 39
of 0 191 39
the 0 191 39
Apostolic 0 191 39
Signatura 0 191 39
appointed 0 191 39
by 0 191 39
Pope 0 191 39
Benedict 0 191 39
XVI, 0 191 39
declares 0 191 39
that 0 191 39
if 0 191 39
Viganò’s 0 191 39
allegations 0 191 39
are 0 191 39
true 0 191 39
then 0 191 39
Bergoglio 0 191 39
must 0 191 39
go: 0 191 39

Of 0 191 40
what 0 191 40
was 0 191 40
said 0 191 40
above 0 191 40
concerning 0 191 40
resignation 0 191 40
from 0 191 40
Church 0 191 40
office 0 191 40
in 0 191 40
general, 0 191 40
what 0 191 40
would 0 191 40
not 0 191 40
apply 0 191 40
to 0 191 40
a 0 191 40
pope, 0 191 40
of 0 191 40
all 0 191 40
office 0 191 40
holders, 0 191 40
if 0 191 40
he, 0 191 40
as 0 191 40
alleged 0 191 40
by 0 191 40
Viganò, 0 191 40
from 0 191 40
the 0 191 40
first 0 191 40
months 0 191 40
of 0 191 40
his 0 191 40
papacy 0 191 40
knowingly 0 191 40
protected 0 191 40
and 0 191 40
favored 0 191 40
a 0 191 40
cardinal 0 191 40
who 0 191 40
was 0 191 40
[pick 0 191 40
a 0 191 40
disgusting 0 191 40
verb]-ing 0 191 40
seminarians? 0 191 40

By 1 191 41
what 1 191 41
possible 1 191 41
stretch 1 191 41
of 1 191 41
the 1 191 41
imagination 1 191 41
would 1 191 41
such 1 191 41
an 1 191 41
occupant 1 191 41
be 1 191 41
suited 1 191 41
for 1 191 41
the 1 191 41
Chair 1 191 41
of 1 191 41
Peter? 1 191 41

Does 0 191 42
the 0 191 42
historical 0 191 42
fact 0 191 42
that 0 191 42
some 0 191 42
pretty 0 191 42
bad 0 191 42
popes 0 191 42
held 0 191 42
on 0 191 42
to 0 191 42
office 0 191 42
despite 0 191 42
committing 0 191 42
various 0 191 42
offenses 0 191 42

other 0 191 42
popes 0 191 42
acting 0 191 42
badly 0 191 42
in 0 191 42
shirking 0 191 42
even 0 191 42
the 0 191 42
minimal 0 191 42
gesture 0 191 42
of 0 191 42
resigning? 0 191 42

Viganò 0 191 43
is 0 191 43
unquestionably 0 191 43
in 0 191 43
a 0 191 43
position 0 191 43
to 0 191 43
know, 0 191 43
and 0 191 43
claims 0 191 43
to 0 191 43
know, 0 191 43
whether 0 191 43
his 0 191 43
central 0 191 43
allegation 0 191 43
that 0 191 43
Francis’ 0 191 43
was 1 191 43
covering 1 191 43
for 1 191 43
McCarrick, 1 191 43
big 1 191 43
time, 1 191 43
for 0 191 43
years, 0 191 43
is 0 191 43
correct. 0 191 43

Believing, 0 191 44
as 0 191 44
he 0 191 44
does, 0 191 44
that 0 191 44
his 0 191 44

near 0 191 50
Rome, 0 191 50
in 0 191 50
1046, 0 191 50
which 0 191 50

three 0 191 50

claimants 0 191 50
to 0 191 50
the 0 191 50

each 0 191 50
installed 0 191 50
by 0 191 50
a 0 191 50
Roman 0 191 50
faction: 0 191 50
First, 0 191 50
the 1 191 50
execrable 1 191 50
Benedict 1 191 50
IX, 1 191 50
mentioned 0 191 50
above. 0 191 50

Gregory 1 191 52

whose 0 191 52
election 0 191 52
was 0 191 52
tainted 0 191 52

seemingly 0 191 52

had 0 191 52
returned 0 191 52
to 0 191 52
Rome 0 191 52
in 0 191 52
1045 0 191 52
and 0 191 52
ousted 0 191 52
Sylvester, 0 191 52
according 0 191 52
to 0 191 52
which 0 191 52
Benedict 0 191 52
would 0 191 52
receive 0 191 52
a 0 191 52
generous 0 191 52

he 0 191 52
resigned 0 191 52
the 0 191 52

resignation. 0 191 52

austere 1 191 53
Christian 1 191 53

IX 0 191 54
(who 0 191 54
had 0 191 54
refused 0 191 54

As 0 191 55
for 0 191 55
Sylvester, 0 191 55
the 0 191 55
Synod 0 191 55
declared 0 191 55
that 0 191 55
he 0 191 55

“stripped 1 191 55
of 1 191 55

rank 1 191 55
and 1 191 55
shut 1 191 55
up 1 191 55
in 1 191 55
a 1 191 55
monastery.” 1 191 55
Gregory 0 191 55
was 0 191 55
also 0 191 55
declared 0 191 55
deposed, 0 191 55
either 0 191 55

he 0 191 56
died 0 191 56
after 0 191 56
only 0 191 56
a 0 191 56
year, 0 191 56

mere 0 191 57
three 0 191 57
weeks 0 191 57

Leo 0 191 57

succeeded 0 191 57

reigning 0 191 57

Leo, 0 191 58
as 0 191 58

which 0 191 58
included 0 191 58
a 0 191 58

although 0 191 60
the 1 191 60

his 0 191 60

the 0 191 60

“the 0 191 60

The 0 191 63

as 0 191 63
a 0 191 63
true 0 191 63

Moreover, 0 191 64
Benedict 0 191 64

himself 0 191 64
is 0 191 64
recognized 0 191 64

the 0 191 64
canon 0 191 64
of 0 191 64
Popes. 0 191 64

This 0 191 65
was 0 191 65
possible 0 191 65
owing 0 191 65
to 0 191 65
the 0 191 65

a 0 191 65

could 0 191 65

even 0 191 66
the 0 191 66

states 0 191 66
that 0 191 66
Benedict 0 191 66
was 0 191 66
Pope 0 191 66
from 0 191 66
1047-1048, 0 191 66

By 0 191 68
1100 0 191 68
what 0 191 68
we 0 191 68
now 0 191 68
know 0 191 68
as 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
College 0 191 68
of 0 191 68
Cardinals, 0 191 68
embracing 0 191 68
all 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
cardinals 0 191 68
of 0 191 68
different 0 191 68
titles, 0 191 68
had 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
exclusive 0 191 68
right 0 191 68
to 0 191 68
elect 0 191 68
a 0 191 68
Pope, 0 191 68
and 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
members 0 191 68
of 0 191 68
the 0 191 68
College 0 191 68
“have 0 191 68
held 0 191 68
it 0 191 68
ever 0 191 68
since.” 0 191 68
(Eric 0 191 68
John, 0 191 68
The 0 191 68
Popes, 0 191 68
181). 0 191 68

These 0 191 69
lessons 0 191 69
of 0 191 69
history 0 191 69
should 0 191 69
suffice 0 191 69
to 1 191 69
dispel 1 191 69
the 1 191 69
pious 1 191 69
fable, 1 191 69
never 0 191 69
a 0 191 69
teaching 0 191 69
of 0 191 69
the 0 191 69
Magisterium, 0 191 69
that 0 191 69
every 0 191 69
Pope 0 191 69
is 0 191 69
chosen 0 191 69
by 0 191 69
the 0 191 69

Ghost 0 191 69
to 0 191 69

the 0 191 69
Church. 0 191 69

This 0 191 70
theological 0 191 70
error, 0 191 70
which 0 191 70
Bergoglio 0 191 70
has 1 191 70
exploited 1 191 70
to 1 191 70
the 1 191 70
hilt, 1 191 70
is 0 191 70
a 0 191 70
key 0 191 70
element 0 191 70
in 0 191 70
the 0 191 70
related 0 191 70
error 0 191 70
of 0 191 70
papalotry, 0 191 70
which 0 191 70
elevates 0 191 70
the 0 191 70
person 0 191 70
of 0 191 70
the 0 191 70
Pope 0 191 70
above 0 191 70
the 0 191 70
office 0 191 70
he 0 191 70
occupies 0 191 70
and 0 191 70
makes 0 191 70
of 0 191 70
him 0 191 70
the 1 191 70
leader 1 191 70
of 1 191 70
a 1 191 70
personality 1 191 70
cult 1 191 70
everyone 1 191 70
is 1 191 70
commanded 1 191 70
to 1 191 70
“love” 1 191 70
(in 1 191 70
the 1 191 70
superficially 1 191 70
emotional 1 191 70
sense) 1 191 70
and 1 191 70
obey 1 191 70
no 1 191 70
matter 1 191 70
what 1 191 70
he 1 191 70
says 1 191 70
or 1 191 70
does, 1 191 70
rather 0 191 70
than 0 191 70
a 1 191 70
custodian 1 191 70
and 1 191 70
defender 1 191 70
of 1 191 70
the 1 191 70
Deposit 1 191 70
of 1 191 70
Faith 1 191 70
whose 1 191 70
lovability, 1 191 70
personality 1 191 70
and 1 191 70
opinions 1 191 70
are 1 191 70
utterly 1 191 70
irrelevant 1 191 70
to 1 191 70
the 1 191 70
exercise 1 191 70
and 1 191 70
scope 1 191 70
of 1 191 70
his 1 191 70
office. 1 191 70

As 0 191 71
Pope 0 191 71
Benedict 0 191 71
has 0 191 71
observed, 0 191 71
when 0 191 71
it 0 191 71
comes 0 191 71
to 0 191 71
the 0 191 71
election 0 191 71
of 0 191 71
a 0 191 71
Pope 0 191 71
“the 0 191 71
Spirit’s 0 191 71
role 0 191 71
should 0 191 71
be 0 191 71
understood 0 191 71
in 0 191 71
a 0 191 71
much 0 191 71
more 0 191 71
elastic 0 191 71
sense, 0 191 71
not 0 191 71
that 0 191 71
he 0 191 71
[sic] 0 191 71
dictates 0 191 71
the 0 191 71
candidate 0 191 71
for 0 191 71
whom 0 191 71
one 0 191 71
must 0 191 71
vote…. 0 191 71

There 1 191 72
are 1 191 72
too 1 191 72
many 1 191 72
contrary 1 191 72
instances 1 191 72
of 1 191 72
popes 1 191 72
the 1 191 72
Holy 1 191 72
Spirit 1 191 72
obviously 1 191 72
would 1 191 72
not 1 191 72
have 1 191 72
picked!” 1 191 72
Bergoglio 1 191 72
is 1 191 72
undeniably 1 191 72
one 1 191 72
of 1 191 72
them. 1 191 72

So 0 191 73
what 0 191 73
can 0 191 73
be 0 191 73
done 0 191 73
to 0 191 73
defend 0 191 73
the 0 191 73
Church 0 191 73
against 0 191 73
Bergoglio? 0 191 73

That 0 191 74
the 0 191 74
mode 0 191 74
of 0 191 74
papal 0 191 74
election 0 191 74
by 0 191 74
cardinals 0 191 74
has 0 191 74
persisted 0 191 74
for 0 191 74
nearly 0 191 74
a 0 191 74
thousand 0 191 74
years 0 191 74
has 0 191 74
led 0 191 74
to 0 191 74
the 0 191 74
general 0 191 74
impression 0 191 74
that 0 191 74
it 0 191 74
pertains 0 191 74
to 0 191 74
the 0 191 74
irreformable 0 191 74
divine 0 191 74
constitution 0 191 74
of 0 191 74
the 0 191 74
Church, 0 191 74
but 0 191 74
it 0 191 74
certainly 0 191 74
does 0 191 74
not. 0 191 74

As 0 191 75
to 0 191 75
matters 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
purely 0 191 75
ecclesiastical 0 191 75
law 0 191 75
such 0 191 75
as 0 191 75
this 0 191 75
one 0 191 75
the 0 191 75
Church 0 191 75
has 0 191 75
always 0 191 75
allowed 0 191 75
for 0 191 75
departures 0 191 75
from 0 191 75
traditional 0 191 75
practice 0 191 75
in 0 191 75
cases 0 191 75
of 0 191 75
emergency 0 191 75
or 0 191 75
grave 0 191 75
necessity. 0 191 75

And 0 191 76
just 0 191 76
as 0 191 76
a 0 191 76
synod 0 191 76
was 0 191 76
employed 0 191 76
to 0 191 76
address 0 191 76
three 0 191 76
rival 0 191 76
claimants 0 191 76
to 0 191 76
the 0 191 76
papal 0 191 76
throne 0 191 76
in 0 191 76
1046, 0 191 76
declaring 0 191 76
at 0 191 76
least 0 191 76
two 0 191 76
of 0 191 76
them 0 191 76
deposed, 0 191 76
so 0 191 76
today 0 191 76
might 0 191 76
it 0 191 76
be 0 191 76
possible 0 191 76
for 0 191 76
reform-minded 0 191 76
cardinals 0 191 76
and 0 191 76
bishops, 0 191 76
comprising 0 191 76
an 0 191 76
imperfect 0 191 76
council, 0 191 76
to 0 191 76
undo 0 191 76
the 1 191 76
incalculable 1 191 76
damage 1 191 76
caused 0 191 76
by 0 191 76
the 0 191 76
cabal 0 191 76
that 0 191 76
lobbied 0 191 76
for 0 191 76
Bergoglio’s 0 191 76
election 0 191 76
before 0 191 76
the 0 191 76
last 0 191 76
conclave—a 0 191 76
cabal 0 191 76
that 0 191 76
included 0 191 76
none 0 191 76
other 0 191 76
than 0 191 76
McCarrick, 0 191 76
whom 0 191 76
Bergoglio 0 191 76
rewarded 0 191 76
by 0 191 76
rehabilitating 0 191 76
that 1 191 76
monster 1 191 76
despite 0 191 76
the 1 191 76
massive 1 191 76
evidence 1 191 76
of 1 191 76
his 1 191 76
unspeakable 1 191 76
crimes. 1 191 76

What 0 191 77
would 0 191 77
be 0 191 77
the 0 191 77
grounds 0 191 77
for 0 191 77
a 0 191 77
declaration 0 191 77
of 0 191 77
deposition 0 191 77
at 0 191 77
such 0 191 77
a 0 191 77
gathering 0 191 77
of 0 191 77
prelates? 0 191 77

One 0 191 78
could 0 191 78
readily 0 191 78
point 0 191 78
to 0 191 78
the 0 191 78
evidence 0 191 78
that 0 191 78
a 0 191 78
faction 0 191 78
that 0 191 78
included 0 191 78
Bergoglio 0 191 78
himself 0 191 78
had 0 191 78
agreed 0 191 78
upon 0 191 78
his 0 191 78
election 0 191 78
before 0 191 78
the 0 191 78
conclave, 0 191 78
and 0 191 78
that 0 191 78
all 0 191 78
those 0 191 78
involved, 0 191 78
including 0 191 78
Bergoglio, 0 191 78
were 0 191 78
thereby 0 191 78
excommunicated 0 191 78
latae 0 191 78

of 1 191 78

Paul 1 191 78

Universi 1 191 78
Dominici 1 191 78
Gregis, 1 191 78
which 1 191 78
provides: 1 191 78

The 1 191 79
Cardinal 1 191 79
electors 1 191 79
shall 1 191 79
further 1 191 79
abstain 1 191 79
from 1 191 79
any 1 191 79
form 1 191 79
of 1 191 79
pact, 1 191 79
agreement, 1 191 79
promise 1 191 79
or 1 191 79
other 1 191 79
commitment 1 191 79
of 1 191 79
any 1 191 79
kind 1 191 79
which 1 191 79
could 1 191 79
oblige 1 191 79
them 1 191 79
to 1 191 79
give 1 191 79
or 1 191 79
deny 1 191 79
their 1 191 79
vote 1 191 79
to 1 191 79
a 1 191 79

If 1 191 80
this 1 191 80

fact 1 191 80
done, 1 191 80
even 1 191 80
under 1 191 80

I 1 191 80
decree 1 191 80
that 1 191 80
such 1 191 80
a 1 191 80
commitment 1 191 80
shall 1 191 80
be 1 191 80
null 1 191 80
and 1 191 80
void 1 191 80
and 1 191 80
that 1 191 80
no 1 191 80
one 1 191 80
shall 1 191 80
be 1 191 80
bound 1 191 80
to 1 191 80
observe 1 191 80
it; 1 191 80
and 1 191 80
I 1 191 80
hereby 1 191 80
impose 1 191 80
the 1 191 80
penalty 1 191 80
of 1 191 80
excommunication 1 191 80
latae 1 191 80
sententiae 1 191 80
upon 1 191 80
those 1 191 80

Then, 1 191 82
lest 1 191 82

deposition 0 191 84
of 0 191 84
Benedict 0 191 84
IX. 0 191 84

Another 0 191 85
ground 0 191 85
for 0 191 85
deposition—as 0 191 85
determined 0 191 85
by 0 191 85
the 0 191 85
imperfect 0 191 85
council, 0 191 85
not 0 191 85
any 0 191 85
of 0 191 85
us—would 0 191 85
be 0 191 85
that 0 191 85
Bergoglio 1 191 85
has 1 191 85
deposed 1 191 85
himself 1 191 85
by 1 191 85
promulgating 1 191 85
heresy, 1 191 85
fracturing 1 191 85
the 1 191 85
Church’s 1 191 85
universal 1 191 85
discipline 1 191 85
respecting 1 191 85
marriage 1 191 85
and 1 191 85
the 1 191 85
Eucharist, 1 191 85
and 1 191 85
undermining 1 191 85
the 1 191 85
teaching 1 191 85
of 1 191 85
even 1 191 85
his 1 191 85
own 1 191 85
immediate 1 191 85
predecessors 1 191 85
on 1 191 85
matters 1 191 85
of 1 191 85
fundamental 1 191 85
morality 1 191 85
upheld 1 191 85
by 1 191 85
the 1 191 85
Magisterium 1 191 85
for 1 191 85
two 1 191 85
millennia. 1 191 85

Surely 0 191 86
the 0 191 86
Church 0 191 86
cannot 0 191 86
be 0 191 86
without 0 191 86
any 0 191 86
remedy 0 191 86
for 0 191 86
a 1 191 86
Pope 1 191 86
who 1 191 86
relentlessly 1 191 86
attacks 1 191 86
her 1 191 86
very 1 191 86
foundations! 1 191 86

To 1 191 87
quote 1 191 87
Cajetan 1 191 87
again: 1 191 87
“Indeed 1 191 87
the 1 191 87
Church 1 191 87
has 1 191 87
the 1 191 87
right 1 191 87
to 1 191 87
separate 1 191 87
herself 1 191 87
from 1 191 87
an 1 191 87
heretical 1 191 87
pope 1 191 87
according 1 191 87
to 1 191 87
divine 1 191 87
law. 1 191 87

Consequently, 1 191 88
it 1 191 88
has 1 191 88
the 1 191 88
right, 1 191 88
by 1 191 88
the 1 191 88
same 1 191 88
divine 1 191 88
law, 1 191 88
to 1 191 88
use 1 191 88
all 1 191 88
means 1 191 88
of 1 191 88
themselves 1 191 88
necessary 1 191 88
for 1 191 88
such 1 191 88
separation; 1 191 88
and 1 191 88
those 1 191 88
that 1 191 88
juridically 1 191 88
correspond 1 191 88
to 1 191 88
the 1 191 88
crime, 1 191 88
are 1 191 88
of 1 191 88
themselves 1 191 88
necessary”—meaning 1 191 88
the 1 191 88
resort 1 191 88
to 1 191 88
an 1 191 88
imperfect 1 191 88
council. 1 191 88

If 0 191 89
a 0 191 89
synod 0 191 89
was 0 191 89
able 0 191 89
to 0 191 89
declare 0 191 89
the 0 191 89
deposition 0 191 89
of 0 191 89
a 0 191 89
pope 0 191 89
in 0 191 89
1046, 0 191 89
why 0 191 89
not 0 191 89
an 0 191 89
imperfect 0 191 89
council 0 191 89
today—or, 0 191 89
for 0 191 89
that 0 191 89
matter, 0 191 89
another 0 191 89
synod? 0 191 89

It 0 191 90
will 0 191 90
be 0 191 90
argued 0 191 90
that 0 191 90
such 0 191 90
a 0 191 90
deposition 0 191 90
would 0 191 90
provoke 0 191 90
massive 0 191 90
schisms 0 191 90
in 0 191 90
the 0 191 90
Church. 0 191 90

But 0 191 91
that 0 191 91
would 0 191 91
not 0 191 91
be 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
first 0 191 91
time 0 191 91
that 0 191 91
defense 0 191 91
of 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
Church’s 0 191 91
common 0 191 91
good 0 191 91
has 0 191 91
done 0 191 91
so, 0 191 91
as 0 191 91
the 0 191 91
Great 0 191 91
Western 0 191 91
Schism 0 191 91
demonstrates. 0 191 91

And 1 191 92
are 1 191 92
we 1 191 92
not 1 191 92
in 1 191 92
the 1 191 92
midst 1 191 92
of 1 191 92
schisms 1 191 92
already, 1 191 92
provoked 1 191 92
by 1 191 92
none 1 191 92
other 1 191 92
than 1 191 92
Bergoglio 1 191 92
himself, 1 191 92
whose 1 191 92
insane 1 191 92
drive 1 191 92
to 1 191 92
shatter 1 191 92
the 1 191 92
Church’s 1 191 92
bimillennial 1 191 92
discipline 1 191 92
has 1 191 92
produced 1 191 92
the 1 191 92
totally 1 191 92
unprecedented 1 191 92
situation 1 191 92
in 1 191 92
which 1 191 92
what 1 191 92
is 1 191 92
still 1 191 92
considered 1 191 92
mortally 1 191 92
sinful 1 191 92
in 1 191 92
one 1 191 92
diocese 1 191 92
is 1 191 92
an 1 191 92
imperative 1 191 92
of 1 191 92
“mercy” 1 191 92
in 1 191 92
another? 1 191 92

In 0 191 93
any 0 191 93
case, 0 191 93
this 0 191 93
much 0 191 93
is 0 191 93
certain: 0 191 93
barring 0 191 93
Bergoglio’s 0 191 93
conversion 0 191 93
and 0 191 93
reversal 0 191 93
of 0 191 93
course, 0 191 93
the 0 191 93
Church 0 191 93
cannot 0 191 93
abide 0 191 93
this 0 191 93
pontificate 0 191 93
any 0 191 93
longer. 0 191 93

One 0 191 94
way 0 191 94
or 0 191 94
another, 0 191 94
the 0 191 94
Church 0 191 94
will 0 191 94
have 0 191 94
to 0 191 94
repel 0 191 94
an 0 191 94
attacker 0 191 94
at 0 191 94
her 0 191 94
very 0 191 94
summit. 0 191 94

Either 1 191 95
the 1 191 95
human 1 191 95
element 1 191 95
of 1 191 95
the 1 191 95
Church 1 191 95
will 1 191 95
act 1 191 95
according 1 191 95
to 1 191 95
the 1 191 95
means 1 191 95
which 1 191 95
seem 1 191 95
possible, 1 191 95
however 1 191 95
extraordinary, 1 191 95
or 1 191 95
Heaven 1 191 95
itself 1 191 95
will 1 191 95
intervene 1 191 95
in 0 191 95
a 0 191 95
manner 0 191 95
that 0 191 95
might 0 191 95
well 0 191 95
involve 0 191 95
a 0 191 95
divine 0 191 95
chastisement 0 191 95
due 0 191 95
to 0 191 95
the 1 191 95
negligence 1 191 95
of 1 191 95
time-serving 1 191 95
pastors 1 191 95
who 1 191 95
left 1 191 95
their 1 191 95
sheep 1 191 95
completely 1 191 95
undefended 1 191 95
against 1 191 95
the 1 191 95
wolves 1 191 95
who 1 191 95
preyed 1 191 95
upon 1 191 95
them, 1 191 95
including 0 191 95
the 1 191 95
wolf 1 191 95
the 1 191 95
cardinals 1 191 95
improvidently 1 191 95
elected 1 191 95
Pope. 1 191 95

with 0 191 96

that 0 191 96

What 0 191 97
can 0 191 97
the 0 191 97
Church 0 191 97
do 0 191 97
when 0 191 97
confronted 0 191 97
by 0 191 97
a 1 191 97
Pope 1 191 97
who, 1 191 97
as 1 191 97
a 1 191 97
prominent 1 191 97
cardinal 1 191 97

“fail[s] 1 191 97

papal 1 191 98

wreaking 1 191 98
havoc 1 191 98
upon 1 191 98
faith 1 191 98

morals 1 191 98
to 1 191 98
the 1 191 98
detriment 1 191 98
of 1 191 98

long 0 191 98
as 0 191 98

No, 0 191 99
Bergoglio 0 191 99

to 1 191 100
end 1 191 100
his 1 191 100
rampage, 1 191 100
must 1 191 100
demand 1 191 100
his 1 191 100
resignation 1 191 100
and, 1 191 100
should 1 191 100
he 1 191 100
refuse 1 191 100

expected, 1 191 100

in 1 191 100
this 1 191 100

very 1 191 100
credibility 1 191 100
he 1 191 100
threatens 1 191 100
to 1 191 100
destroy. 1 191 100

May 0 191 101
God 0 191 101

of 1 196 8
the 1 196 8

can 1 196 8
homosexual 1 196 8

“intrinsically 1 196 8

Such 1 196 8

However, 0 196 11
Marx 0 196 11
said 0 196 11

February 0 196 11
3 0 196 11
that 0 196 11

I 1 196 12

not 1 196 12

there.” 1 196 12

Marx 0 196 13

President 0 196 13
of 0 196 13

As 0 196 14
LifeSiteNews 0 196 14
previously 0 196 14
reported, 0 196 14
Marx 0 196 14
also 0 196 14
said 0 196 14
“yes,” 0 196 14
he 0 196 14
could 0 196 14
imagine 0 196 14
the 0 196 14
creation 0 196 14
of 0 196 14
a 0 196 14
rite 0 196 14
for 0 196 14
homosexual 0 196 14
couples 0 196 14
to 0 196 14
be 0 196 14
blessed 0 196 14
in 0 196 14
the 0 196 14
Church. 0 196 14

This 0 196 15
“encouragement” 0 196 15
from 0 196 15
priests 0 196 15
which 0 196 15
he 0 196 15
called 0 196 15
for 0 196 15
might 0 196 15
include 0 196 15
some 0 196 15
sort 0 196 15
of 0 196 15
“liturgical” 0 196 15
recognition 0 196 15
of 0 196 15
their 0 196 15
union. 0 196 15

But 0 196 16
“how 0 196 16
this 0 196 16
would 0 196 16
be 0 196 16
done 0 196 16
publicly, 0 196 16
in 0 196 16
a 0 196 16

is 0 196 16
“another 0 196 16
question...that 0 196 16
is 0 196 16
where 0 196 16
one 0 196 16
has 0 196 16
to 0 196 16
be 0 196 16
reticent 0 196 16

also 0 196 16

The 0 196 19

that 0 196 19
rather 0 196 19

the 0 196 19
question 0 196 19
in 0 196 19
a 0 196 19
more 0 196 19

without 0 196 19

an 0 196 19
explicit 0 196 19
“yes.” 0 196 19
However, 0 196 19
the 0 196 19
German 0 196 19
Bishops’ 0 196 19
Conference 0 196 19
doesn’t 0 196 19
seem 0 196 19
to 0 196 19
deny 0 196 19
the 0 196 19
rest 0 196 19
of 0 196 19

how 0 196 19
“one 0 196 19
must 0 196 19
encourage 0 196 19
priests” 0 196 19
to 0 196 19
give 0 196 19
encouragement 0 196 19
to 0 196 19
homosexual 0 196 19
couples, 0 196 19
which 0 196 19
could 0 196 19
include 0 196 19
public 0 196 19
blessings 0 196 19
that 0 196 19
would 0 196 19
take 0 196 19

form. 0 196 19

The 0 196 20
cardinal’s 0 196 20

asked 0 196 20
that 0 196 20

spoken 0 196 21
out 0 196 21

“Any 1 196 22
such 1 196 22

He 0 196 23
explained 0 196 23
such 1 196 23
a 1 196 23
“blessing” 1 196 23
would 1 196 23
encourage 1 196 23

continue 1 196 23
living 1 196 23
in 1 196 23
a 1 196 23

the 1 196 23
Church 1 196 23
considers 1 196 23
gravely 1 196 23
sinful 1 196 23
and 1 196 23
spiritually 1 196 23
damaging, 1 196 23
and 1 196 23
therefore 1 196 23
would 1 196 23
be 1 196 23
uncharitable. 1 196 23

“There 0 196 24

“First, 0 196 27
we 0 196 27

big 0 226 16

it 0 226 16
could 0 226 16
spread 0 226 16
to 0 226 16

Africa, 0 226 16
it’s 0 226 16
not 0 226 16
probable, 0 226 16
but 0 226 16
certainly 0 226 16
possible, 0 226 16
that 0 226 16

then 0 226 16
be 0 226 16
difficult 0 226 16

If 1 226 17

at 1 226 17

happen 1 226 17

it 1 226 17

out 1 226 17
of 1 226 17

huge 1 226 17

There 0 226 17
is 0 226 17
always 0 226 17
a 0 226 17
risk 0 226 17
with 0 226 17
travel 0 226 17
that 0 226 17
the 0 226 17

will 1 226 17
spread 1 226 17

Hunter 0 226 17
added. 0 226 17

“We 0 226 18
don’t 0 226 18
want 0 226 18
a 0 226 18
situation 0 226 18
where 0 226 18
the 0 226 18
disease 0 226 18
spreads 0 226 18
so 0 226 18
fast 0 226 18
it 0 226 18
gets 0 226 18
out 0 226 18
of 0 226 18

We 0 226 19
are 0 226 19
talking 0 226 19
about 0 226 19
it 0 226 19
spreading 0 226 19
in 0 226 19
days 0 226 19
rather 0 226 19
than 0 226 19
weeks.” 0 226 19
But 0 226 19
Hunter 0 226 19
is 0 226 19
adamant 0 226 19
that 0 226 19
a 0 226 19
well-developed 0 226 19
country 0 226 19
could 0 226 19
manage 0 226 19
the 0 226 19
plague 0 226 19
should 0 226 19
a 0 226 19
global 0 226 19
outbreak 0 226 19
occur. 0 226 19

Hopefully, 0 226 20
most 0 226 20
will 0 226 20
never 0 226 20
have 0 226 20
to 0 226 20
find 0 226 20
out 0 226 20
how 0 226 20
well 0 226 20
another 0 226 20
country 0 226 20
can 0 226 20
manage 0 226 20
this 0 226 20
infection. 0 226 20

A 0 226 21
few 0 226 21
health 0 226 21
experts 0 226 21
have 0 226 21
warned 0 226 21
that 0 226 21
there 0 226 21
is 0 226 21
no 0 226 21
threat 0 226 21
to 0 226 21

however, 0 226 21
some 1 226 21
have 1 226 21
warned 1 226 21
the 1 226 21
plague 1 226 21
outbreak 1 226 21
will 1 226 21
certainly 1 226 21
spread 1 226 21
to 1 226 21

Conway 0 226 23
is 0 226 23
saying 1 226 23
it’s 1 226 23
“only 1 226 23
a 1 226 23

Conroy 0 226 24
warned 1 226 24
it 1 226 24
is 1 226 24
inevitable 1 226 24
that 1 226 24
the 1 226 24

will 1 226 24
spread 1 226 24
due 0 226 24
to 0 226 24

of 0 226 24
people 0 226 24
across 0 226 24
the 0 226 24

“I 1 226 25
believe 1 226 25
that 1 226 25
it’s 1 226 25
100 1 226 25
percent 1 226 25
likely 1 226 25
that 1 226 25
plague 1 226 25
will 1 226 25
arrive 1 226 25
in 1 226 25
the 1 226 25
UK 1 226 25
once 1 226 25
more 1 226 25
– 1 226 25
it’s 1 226 25
just 1 226 25
a 1 226 25
question 1 226 25
of 1 226 25
‘when’, 1 226 25
not 1 226 25
‘if’. 1 226 25

And 0 226 26
it’s 0 226 26
not 0 226 26
an 0 226 26
exaggeration 0 226 26
to 0 226 26
say 0 226 26
that 0 226 26
this 0 226 26
is 0 226 26
a 0 226 26
real 0 226 26

that’s 1 226 26
waiting 1 226 26

decimate 1 226 26

stonewalled 1 235 11

And, 0 235 12
predictably, 0 235 12
the 0 235 12

tests, 0 235 17
which 0 235 17
determined 0 235 17
that 0 235 17
the 0 235 17
Malian 0 235 17
immigrant 0 235 17
was 0 235 17
not 0 235 17
able 0 235 17
to 0 235 17
stand 0 235 17
trial, 0 235 17
20 0 235 17
Minutes 0 235 17
reported 0 235 17
Wednesday. 0 235 17

This 0 235 18
tired 1 235 18
farce 1 235 18
has 0 235 18
dragged 0 235 18
on. 0 235 18

Kobili 0 235 19
Traore 0 235 19
was 0 235 19
hit 1 235 19
with 0 235 19
hate 0 235 19
crimes 0 235 19
charges. 0 235 19

Then 0 235 20
they 0 235 20
were 0 235 20
dropped. 0 235 20

The 1 235 21
authorities 1 235 21
allowed 1 235 21
him 1 235 21
to 1 235 21
commit 1 235 21
the 1 235 21
crime. 1 235 21

Now 0 235 22
they're 0 235 22
letting 0 235 22
him 0 235 22
get 0 235 22
away 0 235 22
with 0 235 22
it. 0 235 22

Three 0 235 23
minutes 0 235 23
later, 0 235 23
a 0 235 23
unit 0 235 23
of 0 235 23
the 0 235 23
Anti-Crime 0 235 23
Brigade 0 235 23
(BAC) 0 235 23
— 0 235 23
who 0 235 23
happened 0 235 23
to 0 235 23
be 0 235 23
patrolling 0 235 23
the 0 235 23
area 0 235 23
— 0 235 23
took 0 235 23
up 0 235 23
position 0 235 23
in 0 235 23
front 0 235 23
of 0 235 23
Diara’s 0 235 23
door. 0 235 23

They 0 235 24
heard 0 235 24
Kobili 0 235 24
Traore 0 235 24
chanting 0 235 24
Muslim 0 235 24
prayers 0 235 24
and 0 235 24
Koranic 0 235 24
verses. 0 235 24

Unsure 0 235 25
about 0 235 25
the 0 235 25
situation 0 235 25
and 0 235 25
the 0 235 25
potential 0 235 25
threats 0 235 25
to 0 235 25
the 0 235 25
family, 0 235 25
they 0 235 25
asked 0 235 25
for 0 235 25
reinforcements. 0 235 25

Additional 0 235 26
policemen 0 235 26
arrived 0 235 26
quickly. 0 235 26

However, 0 235 27
for 0 235 27
some 0 235 27
unclear 0 235 27
reason, 0 235 27
the 0 235 27
BAC 0 235 27
unit 0 235 27
still 0 235 27
refrained 0 235 27
from 0 235 27
breaking 0 235 27
in. 0 235 27

In 0 235 28
the 0 235 28
meantime, 0 235 28
Kobili 0 235 28
Traore 0 235 28
put 0 235 28
on 0 235 28
new 0 235 28
clothes 0 235 28
and 0 235 28
climbed 0 235 28
out 0 235 28
of 0 235 28
the 0 235 28
window 0 235 28
to 0 235 28
reach 0 235 28
Sarah 0 235 28
Halimi’s 0 235 28
apartment, 0 235 28
which 0 235 28
was 0 235 28
at 0 235 28
the 0 235 28
same 0 235 28
level 0 235 28
as 0 235 28
Diara 0 235 28
Traore’s. 0 235 28

He 0 235 29
allegedly 0 235 29
assaulted 0 235 29
the 0 235 29
Jewish 0 235 29
woman 0 235 29
and 0 235 29
hit 1 235 29
her 1 235 29
mercilessly. 1 235 29

From 0 235 30
time 0 235 30
to 0 235 30
time 0 235 30
he 0 235 30
resumed 0 235 30
Koranic 0 235 30
recitation. 0 235 30

Many 0 235 31
neighbours, 0 235 31
woken 0 235 31
by 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
old 0 235 31
woman’s 0 235 31
screams 0 235 31
or 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
assaulter’s 0 235 31
religious 0 235 31
chanting, 0 235 31
called 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
police 0 235 31
Some 0 235 31
gave 0 235 31
details 0 235 31
about 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
exact 0 235 31
location 0 235 31
of 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
assault, 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
attacker’s 0 235 31
identity, 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
fact 0 235 31
he 0 235 31
vilified 0 235 31
his 0 235 31
victim 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
a 0 235 31
Jewish 0 235 31
person 0 235 31
and 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
“a 1 235 31
Satan” 1 235 31
while 0 235 31
hitting 0 235 31
her, 0 235 31
or 0 235 31
even 0 235 31
— 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
far 0 235 31
as 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
Muslim 0 235 31
neighbours 0 235 31
were 0 235 31
concerned 0 235 31
— 0 235 31
the 0 235 31
Koranic 0 235 31
portions 0 235 31
he 0 235 31
chanted. 0 235 31

Yet 0 235 32
the 0 235 32
police 0 235 32
still 0 235 32
failed 0 235 32
to 0 235 32
storm 0 235 32
Sarah 0 235 32
Halimi’s 0 235 32
apartment 0 235 32
and 0 235 32
rescue 0 235 32
her. 0 235 32

Eventually, 0 235 33
Kobili 0 235 33
Traore 0 235 33
is 0 235 33
claimed 0 235 33
to 0 235 33
have 0 235 33
shouted 0 235 33
that 0 235 33
the 0 235 33
woman 0 235 33
was 0 235 33
“mad 0 235 33
and 0 235 33
about 0 235 33
to 0 235 33
commit 0 235 33
suicide”, 0 235 33
and 0 235 33
threw 0 235 33
her 0 235 33
out 0 235 33
of 0 235 33
the 0 235 33
window. 0 235 33

He 0 235 34
had 0 235 34
time 0 235 34
enough 0 235 34
to 0 235 34
climb 0 235 34
back 0 235 34
to 0 235 34
Diara 0 235 34
Traore’s 0 235 34
apartment 0 235 34
where 0 235 34
he 0 235 34
finally 0 235 34
was 0 235 34
arrested. 0 235 34

His 0 235 35
hands 0 235 35
were 0 235 35
covered 0 235 35
in 0 235 35
blood. 0 235 35

There 0 235 36
was 0 235 36
blood 0 235 36
everywhere 0 235 36
in 0 235 36
his 0 235 36
victim’s 0 235 36
apartment. 0 235 36

Sure 0 235 37
he 0 235 37
was 0 235 37
crazy. 1 235 37

So 0 235 38
crazy 0 235 38
he 0 235 38
tried 0 235 38
to 0 235 38
contrive 0 235 38
an 0 235 38
alibi 0 235 38
for 0 235 38
his 0 235 38
crime. 0 235 38

Kobili 0 235 39
isn't 0 235 39
crazy. 1 235 39

But 0 235 40
the 0 235 40
system 0 235 40
that 0 235 40
keeps 0 235 40
on 0 235 40
protecting 0 235 40
him 0 235 40
is. 0 235 40

The 0 243 3
unidentified 0 243 3

says 0 243 3
the 0 243 3
incident 0 243 3
took 0 243 3
place 0 243 3
at 0 243 3
a 0 243 3
party 0 243 3
in 0 243 3
the 0 243 3
early 0 243 3
1980s 0 243 3
while 0 243 3
Kavanaugh 0 243 3
was 0 243 3

the 0 243 3
letter 0 243 3
on 0 243 3
Friday. 0 243 3

She 0 243 4
alleges 0 243 4
Kavanaugh 0 243 4
and 0 243 4
a 0 243 4
friend 0 243 4
of 0 243 4
his, 0 243 4
both 0 243 4
of 0 243 4
whom 0 243 4
had 0 243 4
been 0 243 4
drinking, 0 243 4
cornered 0 243 4
her 0 243 4
in 0 243 4
a 0 243 4
room 0 243 4
and 0 243 4
turned 0 243 4
up 0 243 4
the 0 243 4

of 0 243 4
her 0 243 4

Kavanaugh 0 243 5
then 0 243 5
allegedly 0 243 5
covered 0 243 5
the 0 243 5
woman’s 0 243 5
mouth 0 243 5
with 0 243 5
his 0 243 5

her, 0 243 5
but 0 243 5
she 0 243 5
says 0 243 5
she 0 243 5
managed 0 243 5
to 0 243 5

herself 0 243 5
and 0 243 5
bolt 0 243 5
out 0 243 5
of 0 243 5
the 0 243 5

Kavanaugh, 0 243 6
53, 0 243 6
vehemently 1 243 6
denied 1 243 6
the 0 243 6
woman’s 0 243 6
allegations. 0 243 6

“I 0 243 7
categorically 1 243 7

unequivocally 1 243 7

he 0 243 7
said 0 243 7
in 0 243 7
a 0 243 7
statement. 0 243 7

“I 0 243 8
did 0 243 8
not 0 243 8
do 0 243 8

back 0 243 8
in 0 243 8
high 0 243 8
school 0 243 8
or 0 243 8
at 0 243 8
any 0 243 8
time.” 0 243 8

Kavanaugh’s 0 243 9
friend, 0 243 9
who 0 243 9
has 0 243 9
not 0 243 9
been 0 243 9
identified, 0 243 9
did 0 243 9
not 0 243 9
outright 0 243 9
deny 0 243 9
the 0 243 9
woman’s 0 243 9
claims 0 243 9
but 0 243 9
told 0 243 9
the 0 243 9
New 0 243 9

he 0 243 9
has 0 243 9
“no 0 243 9

The 0 243 10

says 0 243 10
she 0 243 10
has 0 243 10
had 0 243 10

But 0 259 2
this 0 259 2
is 0 259 2
a 0 259 2
case 0 259 2
where 0 259 2
Obama 0 259 2
Inc. 0 259 2
tried 0 259 2
to 0 259 2
get 0 259 2
them 0 259 2

they 0 259 3
did 0 259 3
the 0 259 3

The 0 259 4
Obama 0 259 4
administration 0 259 4
secretly 0 259 4
sought 0 259 4
to 0 259 4
give 0 259 4
Iran 0 259 4
access 0 259 4
— 0 259 4
albeit 0 259 4
briefly 0 259 4
— 0 259 4
to 0 259 4
the 0 259 4
U.S. 0 259 4
financial 0 259 4
system 0 259 4
by 0 259 4
sidestepping 0 259 4
sanctions 0 259 4
kept 0 259 4
in 0 259 4
place 0 259 4
after 0 259 4
the 0 259 4
2015 0 259 4
nuclear 0 259 4
deal, 0 259 4
despite 0 259 4
repeatedly 0 259 4
telling 0 259 4
Congress 0 259 4
and 0 259 4
the 0 259 4
public 0 259 4
it 0 259 4
had 0 259 4
no 0 259 4
plans 0 259 4
to 0 259 4
do 0 259 4
so. 0 259 4

Yet 0 259 5
another 0 259 5
Obama 0 259 5
dirty 1 259 5
deal 1 259 5
with 0 259 5
Iran 0 259 5
that 0 259 5
we're 0 259 5
just 0 259 5
learning 0 259 5
about 0 259 5
now. 0 259 5

The 0 259 6
question 0 259 6
is 0 259 6
how 1 259 6
many 1 259 6
more 1 259 6
are 1 259 6
there? 1 259 6

And 0 259 7
that's 0 259 7
part 0 259 7
of 0 259 7
why 0 259 7
Spygate 0 259 7
is 0 259 7
happening. 0 259 7

The 0 259 8
assault 0 259 8
is 0 259 8
also 0 259 8
a 0 259 8
cover-up. 0 259 8

The 0 259 9
report 0 259 9
by 0 259 9
the 0 259 9
Senate 0 259 9
Permanent 0 259 9
Subcommittee 0 259 9
on 0 259 9
Investigations 0 259 9
revealed 0 259 9
that 0 259 9
under 0 259 9
President 0 259 9
Barack 0 259 9
Obama, 0 259 9
the 0 259 9
Treasury 0 259 9
Department 0 259 9
issued 0 259 9
a 0 259 9
license 0 259 9
in 0 259 9
February 0 259 9
2016, 0 259 9
never 0 259 9
previously 0 259 9
disclosed, 0 259 9
that 0 259 9
would 0 259 9
have 0 259 9
allowed 0 259 9
Iran 0 259 9
to 0 259 9
convert 0 259 9
$5.7 0 259 9
billion 0 259 9
it 0 259 9
held 0 259 9
at 0 259 9
a 0 259 9
bank 0 259 9
in 0 259 9
Oman 0 259 9
from 0 259 9
Omani 0 259 9
rials 0 259 9
into 0 259 9
euros 0 259 9
by 0 259 9
exchanging 0 259 9
them 0 259 9
first 0 259 9
into 0 259 9
U.S. 0 259 9
dollars. 0 259 9

If 0 259 10
the 0 259 10
Omani 0 259 10
bank 0 259 10
had 0 259 10
allowed 0 259 10
the 0 259 10
exchange 0 259 10
without 0 259 10
such 0 259 10
a 0 259 10
license, 0 259 10
it 0 259 10
would 0 259 10
have 0 259 10
violated 0 259 10
sanctions 0 259 10
that 0 259 10
bar 0 259 10
Iran 0 259 10
from 0 259 10
transactions 0 259 10
that 0 259 10
touch 0 259 10
the 0 259 10
U.S. 0 259 10
financial 0 259 10
system. 0 259 10

The 0 259 11
effort 0 259 11
was 0 259 11
unsuccessful 0 259 11
because 0 259 11
American 0 259 11
banks 0 259 11
— 0 259 11
themselves 0 259 11
afraid 0 259 11
of 0 259 11
running 0 259 11
afoul 0 259 11
of 0 259 11
U.S. 0 259 11
sanctions 0 259 11
— 0 259 11
declined 0 259 11
to 0 259 11
participate. 0 259 11

The 0 259 12
Obama 0 259 12
administration 0 259 12
approached 0 259 12
two 0 259 12
U.S. 0 259 12
banks 0 259 12
to 0 259 12
facilitate 0 259 12
the 0 259 12
conversion, 0 259 12
the 0 259 12
report 0 259 12
said, 0 259 12
but 0 259 12
both 0 259 12
refused, 0 259 12
citing 0 259 12
the 0 259 12
reputational 0 259 12
risk 0 259 12
of 0 259 12
doing 0 259 12
business 0 259 12
with 0 259 12
or 0 259 12
for 0 259 12
Iran. 0 259 12

That's 0 259 13
how 0 259 13
bad 1 259 13
Obama 0 259 13
was 0 259 13
on 0 259 13
Iran. 0 259 13

The 0 259 14
banking 0 259 14
system 0 259 14
was 0 259 14
more 0 259 14
reluctant 0 259 14
to 0 259 14
help 0 259 14
Iran 0 259 14
launder 0 259 14
money 0 259 14
than 0 259 14
he 0 259 14
was. 0 259 14

Nor 0 259 15
was 0 259 15
Obama 0 259 15
worried 0 259 15
about 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
reputational 0 259 15
risk 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
loading 0 259 15
foreign 0 259 15
currency 0 259 15
on 0 259 15
unmarked 0 259 15
cargo 0 259 15
planes 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
flying 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
to 0 259 15
Iran. 0 259 15

Issuing 0 259 16
the 0 259 16
license 0 259 16
was 0 259 16
not 0 259 16
illegal. 0 259 16

Still, 0 259 17
it 0 259 17
went 0 259 17
above 0 259 17
and 0 259 17
beyond 0 259 17
what 0 259 17
the 0 259 17
Obama 0 259 17
administration 0 259 17
was 0 259 17
required 0 259 17
to 0 259 17
do 0 259 17
under 0 259 17
the 0 259 17
terms 0 259 17
of 0 259 17
the 0 259 17
nuclear 0 259 17
agreement. 0 259 17

Except 0 259 18
Obama 0 259 18
Inc. 0 259 18
weren't 0 259 18
trying 0 259 18
to 0 259 18
drive 0 259 18
a 0 259 18
hard 0 259 18
bargain. 0 259 18

So 0 259 19
they 0 259 19
didn't 0 259 19
stick 0 259 19
to 0 259 19
it. 0 259 19

They 0 259 20
were 0 259 20
trying 0 259 20
to 0 259 20
aid 0 259 20
Iran. 0 259 20

Shortly 0 259 21
after 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
nuclear 0 259 21
deal 0 259 21
was 0 259 21
sealed 0 259 21
in 0 259 21
July 0 259 21
2015, 0 259 21
then-Treasury 0 259 21
Secretary 0 259 21
Jack 0 259 21
Lew 0 259 21
testified 0 259 21
that 0 259 21
even 0 259 21
with 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
sanctions 0 259 21
relief, 0 259 21
Iran 0 259 21
“will 0 259 21
continue 0 259 21
to 0 259 21
be 0 259 21
denied 0 259 21
access 0 259 21
to 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
world’s 0 259 21
largest 0 259 21
financial 0 259 21
and 0 259 21
commercial 0 259 21
market.” 0 259 21
A 0 259 21
month 0 259 21
later, 0 259 21
one 0 259 21
of 0 259 21
Lew’s 0 259 21
top 0 259 21
deputies, 0 259 21
Adam 0 259 21
Szubin, 0 259 21
testified 0 259 21
that 0 259 21
despite 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
nuclear 0 259 21
deal 0 259 21
“Iran 0 259 21
will 0 259 21
be 0 259 21
denied 0 259 21
access 0 259 21
to 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
world’s 0 259 21
most 1 259 21
important 1 259 21
market 1 259 21
and 0 259 21
unable 0 259 21
to 0 259 21
deal 0 259 21
in 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
world’s 0 259 21
most 1 259 21
important 1 259 21
currency.” 1 259 21

This 0 259 22
was 0 259 22
typical 0 259 22
of 0 259 22
the 0 259 22
worthless 1 259 22
assurances 0 259 22
that 0 259 22
Obama 0 259 22
officials 0 259 22
made. 0 259 22

And 0 259 23
disgraced 1 259 23
themselves 0 259 23
by 0 259 23
doing 0 259 23
so. 0 259 23

Obama 0 259 24
administration 0 259 24
officials 0 259 24
at 0 259 24
the 0 259 24
time 0 259 24
assured 0 259 24
concerned 0 259 24
lawmakers 0 259 24
that 0 259 24
a 0 259 24
general 0 259 24
license 0 259 24
wouldn’t 0 259 24
be 0 259 24
coming. 0 259 24

But 0 259 25
the 0 259 25
report 0 259 25
from 0 259 25
the 0 259 25
Republican 0 259 25
members 0 259 25
of 0 259 25
the 0 259 25
Senate 0 259 25
panel 0 259 25
showed 0 259 25
that 0 259 25
a 0 259 25
draft 0 259 25
of 0 259 25
the 0 259 25
license 0 259 25
was 0 259 25
indeed 0 259 25
prepared, 0 259 25
though 0 259 25
it 0 259 25
was 0 259 25
never 0 259 25
published. 0 259 25

And 0 259 26
when 0 259 26
questioned 0 259 26
by 0 259 26

about 0 259 26
the 0 259 26
possibility 0 259 26
of 0 259 26

another 0 277 15

It's 1 277 17
the 1 277 17
only 1 277 17
country 1 277 17
that 1 277 17

both 0 280 3

in 0 280 7
an 0 280 7
interview 0 280 7
with 0 280 7
the 0 280 7
German 0 280 7
Bild 0 280 7
newspaper 0 280 7
why 0 280 7
Budapest 0 280 7
does 0 280 7
not 0 280 7
want 0 280 7
to 0 280 7
accept 0 280 7
any 0 280 7
refugees, 0 280 7
Orban 0 280 7
replied: 0 280 7
“We 0 280 7
don’t 0 280 7
consider 0 280 7
these 0 280 7
people 0 280 7
to 0 280 7
be 0 280 7
Muslim 0 280 7
refugees.” 0 280 7
Instead, 0 280 7
the 0 280 7
tough-talking 0 280 7
politician 0 280 7
said 0 280 7
they 0 280 7
were 0 280 7
regarded 0 280 7
as 0 280 7
“Muslim 1 280 7
invaders.” 1 280 7
Asylum 0 280 7
seekers 0 280 7
must 0 280 7
cross 0 280 7
four 0 280 7
countries 0 280 7
to 0 280 7
reach 0 280 7
Hungary 0 280 7
from 0 280 7
Syria, 0 280 7
all 0 280 7
of 0 280 7
which 0 280 7
are 0 280 7
not 0 280 7
as 0 280 7
rich 0 280 7
as 0 280 7
Germany 0 280 7
but 0 280 7
are 0 280 7
economically 0 280 7
stable, 0 280 7
the 0 280 7
PM 0 280 7
said. 0 280 7

He 0 280 8
was 0 280 8
apparently 0 280 8
referring 0 280 8
to 0 280 8
Turkey, 0 280 8
Greece, 0 280 8
Macedonia 0 280 8
and 0 280 8
Serbia 0 280 8
– 0 280 8
a 0 280 8
common 0 280 8
route 0 280 8
for 0 280 8
migrants 0 280 8
heading 0 280 8
for 0 280 8
‘wealthy’ 0 280 8
Europe. 0 280 8

“So, 0 280 9
they 0 280 9
are 0 280 9
not 0 280 9
running 0 280 9
for 0 280 9
their 0 280 9
lives 0 280 9
[in 0 280 9
these 0 280 9
countries]. 0 280 9

They 0 280 10
are 0 280 10
merely 0 280 10
economic 0 280 10
migrants 0 280 10
seeking 0 280 10
a 0 280 10
better 0 280 10
life,” 0 280 10
Orban 0 280 10
concluded. 0 280 10

He 0 280 11
stressed 0 280 11
though, 0 280 11
that 0 280 11
he 0 280 11
can 0 280 11
only 0 280 11
speak 0 280 11
for 0 280 11
the 0 280 11
Hungarians 0 280 11
and 0 280 11
they 1 280 11
“don’t 1 280 11
want” 1 280 11
immigration. 1 280 11

In 0 280 12
his 0 280 12
view, 0 280 12
the 0 280 12
government 0 280 12
simply 0 280 12
can’t 0 280 12
go 0 280 12
against 0 280 12
the 0 280 12
will 0 280 12
of 0 280 12
the 0 280 12
people. 0 280 12

And 0 280 13
Orban 0 280 13
has 0 280 13
stayed 0 280 13
the 0 280 13
course, 0 280 13
too 0 280 13
while 0 280 13
governments 0 280 13
like 0 280 13
that 0 280 13
of 0 280 13
Germany 0 280 13
have 0 280 13
ignored 0 280 13
their 0 280 13
people 0 280 13
to 0 280 13
allow 0 280 13
for 0 280 13
a 0 280 13
clear 0 280 13
invasion 0 280 13
of 0 280 13
Germany 0 280 13
that 0 280 13
has 0 280 13
led 0 280 13
to 0 280 13
untold 1 280 13
numbers 1 280 13
of 0 280 13
sexual 1 280 13
assaults 1 280 13
by 1 280 13
Muslim 1 280 13
migrants, 1 280 13
attacks 1 280 13
on 1 280 13
Christians 1 280 13
and 1 280 13
there's 1 280 13
no 1 280 13
telling 1 280 13
the 1 280 13
amount 1 280 13
of 1 280 13
damage 1 280 13
to 1 280 13
the 1 280 13
unethical 1 280 13
welfare 1 280 13
system 1 280 13
in 1 280 13
the 1 280 13
country. 1 280 13

RT 0 280 14
continues: 0 280 14

Going 0 280 15
further, 0 280 15
the 0 280 15
prime 0 280 15
minister 0 280 15
noted 0 280 15
that 0 280 15
no 0 280 15
refugee 0 280 15
wants 0 280 15
to 0 280 15
go 0 280 15
to 0 280 15
Portugal, 0 280 15
for 0 280 15
example, 0 280 15
adding 0 280 15
that 0 280 15
the 0 280 15
majority 0 280 15
of 0 280 15
asylum 0 280 15
seekers 0 280 15
simply 0 280 15
wanted 0 280 15
to 0 280 15
live 0 280 15
in 0 280 15
prosperous 0 280 15
Germany. 0 280 15

“The 1 280 16
reason 1 280 16
why 1 280 16
people 1 280 16
are 1 280 16
in 1 280 16
your 1 280 16
country 1 280 16
is 1 280 16
not 1 280 16
because 1 280 16
they 1 280 16
are 1 280 16
refugees, 1 280 16
but 1 280 16
because 1 280 16
they 1 280 16
want 1 280 16
a 1 280 16
German 1 280 16
life,” 1 280 16
he 0 280 16
said, 0 280 16
describing 0 280 16
the 0 280 16
issue 0 280 16
“politically” 0 280 16
as 0 280 16
a 0 280 16
European 0 280 16
problem 0 280 16
but, 0 280 16
“sociologically,” 0 280 16
as 0 280 16
a 0 280 16
German 0 280 16
problem. 0 280 16

Orban 0 280 17
specifically 0 280 17
targeted 0 280 17
Germany 0 280 17
and 0 280 17
Chancellor 0 280 17
Angela 0 280 17
Merkel’s 0 280 17
‘open-door’ 0 280 17
policy 0 280 17
towards 0 280 17
asylum 0 280 17
seekers. 0 280 17

“I’ve 0 280 18
never 0 280 18
understood 0 280 18
how 0 280 18
chaos, 1 280 18
anarchy 1 280 18
and 1 280 18
illegal 1 280 18
border 1 280 18
crossings 1 280 18
are 0 280 18
viewed 0 280 18
as 0 280 18
something 0 280 18
good 0 280 18
in 0 280 18
a 0 280 18
country 0 280 18
like 0 280 18
Germany, 0 280 18
which 0 280 18
we 0 280 18
view 0 280 18
as 0 280 18
the 1 280 18
best 1 280 18
example 1 280 18
of 1 280 18
discipline 1 280 18
and 1 280 18
the 1 280 18
rule 1 280 18
of 1 280 18
law,” 1 280 18
he 0 280 18
said. 0 280 18

The 0 280 19
recent 0 280 19
wave 0 280 19
of 0 280 19
refugees 0 280 19
reaching 0 280 19
Europe 0 280 19
is 0 280 19
merely 0 280 19
an 0 280 19
invasion, 1 280 19
according 0 280 19
to 0 280 19
Orban. 0 280 19

“If 0 280 20
someone 0 280 20
wants 0 280 20
to 0 280 20
come 0 280 20
to 0 280 20
your 0 280 20
house, 0 280 20
he 0 280 20
knocks 0 280 20
on 0 280 20
your 0 280 20
door 0 280 20
and 0 280 20
asks: 0 280 20
‘Can 0 280 20
we 0 280 20
come 0 280 20
in, 0 280 20
can 0 280 20
we 0 280 20
stay?’ 0 280 20
They 0 280 20
[asylum 0 280 20
seekers] 0 280 20
didn’t 0 280 20
do 0 280 20
that, 0 280 20
they 0 280 20
crossed 0 280 20
the 0 280 20
border 0 280 20
illegally,” 0 280 20
he 0 280 20
stated. 0 280 20

Orban 0 280 21
then 0 280 21
did 0 280 21
what 0 280 21
most 0 280 21
political 0 280 21
representatives 0 280 21
will 0 280 21
simply 0 280 21
not 0 280 21
do, 0 280 21
he 0 280 21
told 0 280 21
the 0 280 21
truth 0 280 21
about 0 280 21
multiculturalism. 0 280 21

He 0 280 22
called 0 280 22
it 0 280 22
an 0 280 22
"illusion" 0 280 22
and 0 280 22
said 0 280 22
that 0 280 22
Christian 1 280 22
and 1 280 22
Muslim 1 280 22
societies 1 280 22
“will 1 280 22
never 1 280 22
unite.” 1 280 22

Of 0 280 23
course, 0 280 23
they 0 280 23
won't. 0 280 23

They 1 280 24
have 1 280 24
absolutely 1 280 24
nothing 1 280 24
in 1 280 24
common. 1 280 24

They 1 280 25
cannot 1 280 25
agree 1 280 25
on 1 280 25
God's 1 280 25
law, 1 280 25
which 1 280 25
most 1 280 25
Western 1 280 25
societies 1 280 25
were 1 280 25
base 1 280 25
on, 1 280 25
including 1 280 25
the 1 280 25
united 1 280 25
States. 1 280 25

They 1 280 26
cannot 1 280 26
agree 1 280 26
on 0 280 26
the 0 280 26
Scriptures. 0 280 26

They 1 280 27
cannot 1 280 27
agree 1 280 27
on 1 280 27
the 0 280 27
person 0 280 27
and 0 280 27
work 0 280 27
of 0 280 27
Jesus 0 280 27
the 0 280 27
Christ. 0 280 27

They 0 280 28
can't 0 280 28
even 0 280 28
agree 0 280 28
on 0 280 28
the 0 280 28
means 0 280 28
of 0 280 28
proselytizing 0 280 28
and 0 280 28
of 0 280 28
what 0 280 28
real 0 280 28
spiritual 0 280 28
weapons 0 280 28
are. 0 280 28

PM 0 280 29
Orban 0 280 29
has 0 280 29
remained 0 280 29
consistent. 0 280 29

He 0 280 30
has 0 280 30
publicly 0 280 30
told 0 280 30
the 0 280 30
Muslim 1 280 30
invaders 1 280 30
to 0 280 30
leave 1 280 30
Hungary 1 280 30
and 1 280 30
never 1 280 30
come 1 280 30
back. 1 280 30

He 0 280 31
has 0 280 31
rebuffed 0 280 31
Brussels, 0 280 31
which 0 280 31
is 0 280 31
largely 0 280 31
Islamic, 0 280 31
and 0 280 31
told 0 280 31
them 0 280 31
that 0 280 31
Hungary 1 280 31
would 1 280 31
defend 1 280 31
its 1 280 31
borders, 1 280 31
and 1 280 31
it 1 280 31
has. 1 280 31

Orban's 0 280 32
border 0 280 32
wall 0 280 32
reduced 0 280 32
illegal 0 280 32
immigration 0 280 32
by 0 280 32
99%! 0 280 32

He 1 280 33
has 1 280 33
genuinely 1 280 33
reached 1 280 33
out 1 280 33
his 1 280 33
hand 1 280 33
to 1 280 33
help 1 280 33
Christian 1 280 33
migrants 1 280 33
instead 1 280 33
of 1 280 33
Muslim 1 280 33
migrants 1 280 33
and 1 280 33
he 1 280 33
seems 1 280 33
to 1 280 33
be 1 280 33
one 1 280 33
that 1 280 33
holds 1 280 33
to 1 280 33
the 1 280 33
Christian 1 280 33
faith, 1 280 33
as 1 280 33
emulated 1 280 33
by 1 280 33
the 1 280 33
Protestant 1 280 33
Reformers, 1 280 33
saying, 1 280 33
"That 1 280 33
which 1 280 33
serves 1 280 33
the 1 280 33
glory 1 280 33
of 1 280 33
God 1 280 33
is 1 280 33
the 1 280 33
best 1 280 33
for 1 280 33
the 1 280 33
people." 1 280 33

Furthermore, 0 280 34
Orban 0 280 34
has 0 280 34
also 0 280 34
called 0 280 34
out 0 280 34
the 0 280 34
man 1 280 34
behind 1 280 34
the 1 280 34

of 0 280 34

Anti-jihadist 0 280 35
activist 0 280 35
Pamela 0 280 35
Geller 0 280 35
praised 0 280 35
Orban 0 280 35
for 0 280 35
his 0 280 35
honesty 0 280 35
and 0 280 35
wrote, 0 280 35
"At 0 280 35

And 0 280 36
while 0 280 36
Orban 0 280 36
is 0 280 36
right 0 280 36
that 0 280 36

was 0 316 11
really, 0 316 11
I 0 316 11
guess, 0 316 11
afraid 0 316 11
of 0 316 11

Malcolm 0 316 12
X 0 316 12

adequately 0 316 12
afraid 0 316 12
of 0 316 12
them. 0 316 12

Here’s 0 316 13
what 0 316 13
happened 0 316 13
to 0 316 13
him: 0 316 13

Muhammad 0 316 15
said 0 316 15
he 0 316 15
thought 0 316 15
the 0 316 15
photograph 0 316 15
would 0 316 15
be 0 316 15
“damaging 0 316 15
politically” 0 316 15
if 0 316 15
it 0 316 15
were 0 316 15
released 0 316 15
and 0 316 15
was 1 316 15
afraid 1 316 15
that 1 316 15
someone 1 316 15
might 1 316 15
“break 1 316 15
into 1 316 15
his 1 316 15
apartment” 1 316 15
looking 1 316 15
for 1 316 15
it, 1 316 15
like 0 316 15
“that 0 316 15
Watergate 0 316 15
crap.” 1 316 15
He 0 316 15
said 0 316 15
he 0 316 15
“felt 0 316 15
a 0 316 15
little 0 316 15
bit 0 316 15
more 0 316 15
at 0 316 15
ease” 0 316 15
after 0 316 15
Farrakhan 0 316 15
in 0 316 15
2016 0 316 15
claimed 0 316 15
that 0 316 15
Obama 0 316 15
visited 0 316 15
his 0 316 15
home 0 316 15
in 0 316 15
Chicago. 0 316 15

Muhammad 0 316 16
contacted 0 316 16
Farrakhan 0 316 16
in 0 316 16
autumn 0 316 16
2017 0 316 16
with 0 316 16
the 0 316 16
“final 0 316 16
manuscript” 0 316 16
for 0 316 16
a 0 316 16
self-published 0 316 16
book 0 316 16
containing 0 316 16
the 0 316 16
photo. 0 316 16

“I 0 316 17
sent 0 316 17
him 0 316 17
a 0 316 17
copy 0 316 17
of 0 316 17
the 0 316 17
manuscript 0 316 17
suggesting 0 316 17
that, 0 316 17
showing 0 316 17
him 0 316 17
the 0 316 17
picture, 0 316 17
and 0 316 17
saying 0 316 17
to 0 316 17
him, 0 316 17
if 0 316 17
he 0 316 17
did 0 316 17
not 0 316 17
object, 0 316 17
I 0 316 17
was 0 316 17
going 0 316 17
to 0 316 17
publish 0 316 17
it,” 0 316 17
Muhammad 0 316 17
said. 0 316 17

“He 0 316 18
had 0 316 18
no 0 316 18
objection.” 0 316 18
… 0 316 18
During 0 316 18
Obama’s 0 316 18
presidential 0 316 18
campaign, 0 316 18
conservatives 0 316 18
pushed 0 316 18
multiple 0 316 18
apparently 0 316 18
racially 0 316 18
motivated 0 316 18
conspiracy 0 316 18
theories 0 316 18
about 0 316 18
Obama’s 0 316 18
religion 0 316 18
and 0 316 18
supposed 0 316 18
ties 0 316 18
to 0 316 18
Islam. 0 316 18

For 0 316 19
example, 0 316 19
in 0 316 19
Obama’s 0 316 19
memoir 0 316 19
subtitled 0 316 19
A 0 316 19

Obama 0 316 19

his 0 316 19
being 0 316 19
a 0 316 19

newspaper 0 316 19
The 0 316 19
Final 0 316 19

Obama 0 316 20
recollects 0 316 20
Farrakhan’s 0 316 20
black 0 316 20
nationalist 0 316 20

Farrakhan’s 0 316 21
eventual 0 316 21
failure 0 316 21
suggests 0 316 21
to 0 316 21
Obama 0 316 21
that’s 0 316 21
there 0 316 21
is 0 316 21
more 0 316 21
economic 0 316 21
upside 0 316 21
for 0 316 21
blacks 0 316 21
in 0 316 21

than 0 316 21
in 0 316 21
building 0 316 21

During 0 316 22
the 0 316 22
2008 0 316 22
presidential 0 316 22
election, 0 316 22
conservatives 0 316 22
questioned 0 316 22
the 0 316 22
indirect 0 316 22
ties 0 316 22
between 0 316 22
Farrakhan 0 316 22
and 0 316 22
Obama, 0 316 22
who 0 316 22
attended 0 316 22
a 0 316 22
church 0 316 22
that 0 316 22
gave 0 316 22
Farrakhan 0 316 22
an 0 316 22
award. 0 316 22

Obama’s 0 316 23
“spiritual 1 316 23
advisor” 1 316 23
Rev. 0 316 23

Jeremiah 0 316 24
Wright 0 316 24
gave 0 316 24

his 0 316 24
church’s 0 316 24
Lifetime 0 316 24
Achievement 0 316 24
award 0 316 24

Regency 0 316 24
in 0 316 24
November 0 316 24
2007, 0 316 24
but 0 316 24
the 0 316 24
story 0 316 24
didn’t 0 316 24
make 0 316 24
the 0 316 24
press 0 316 24
until 0 316 24
the 0 316 24
following 0 316 24
year. 0 316 24

Similarly, 0 316 25
very 0 316 25
little 0 316 25
media 0 316 25
attention 0 316 25
was 0 316 25
paid 0 316 25
to 0 316 25
the 0 316 25
close 0 316 25
relationship 0 316 25
between 0 316 25
Obama’s 0 316 25
fundraiser 0 316 25
and 0 316 25
private 0 316 25
mentor 0 316 25
Tony 0 316 25
Rezko 0 316 25
and 0 316 25
the 0 316 25
Nation 0 316 25
of 0 316 25
Islam, 0 316 25
even 0 316 25
though 0 316 25
Rezko’s 0 316 25
role 0 316 25
was 0 316 25
business 0 316 25
manager 0 316 25
for 0 316 25
Nation 0 316 25
of 0 316 25
Islam 0 316 25
assets, 0 316 25
such 0 316 25
as 0 316 25
the 0 316 25
career 0 316 25
of 0 316 25
Muhammad 0 316 25
Ali. 0 316 25

But 0 316 26
after 0 316 26
all, 0 316 26
what 0 316 26
could 0 316 26
be 0 316 26
more 0 316 26
boring 0 316 26
than 0 316 26
a 0 316 26
story 0 316 26
than 0 316 26
involves 0 316 26
a 0 316 26
Presidential 0 316 26
candidate, 0 316 26
the 0 316 26
Syrian 0 316 26

Reading 1 316 27
Obama’s 1 316 27
1995 1 316 27
memoir, 1 316 27
you 1 316 27
might 1 316 27
almost 1 316 27
get 1 316 27
the 1 316 27
impression 1 316 27
that 1 316 27
after 1 316 27
a 1 316 27

police 1 316 27

a 1 316 27

Case 0 324 0

Hey, 0 324 1
remember 0 324 1
five 0 324 1
minutes 0 324 1
ago 0 324 1
when 0 324 1
Pope 0 324 1
Francis 0 324 1
shouted 0 324 1
at 0 324 1
a 0 324 1
reporter 0 324 1
in 0 324 1
Chile 0 324 1
that 0 324 1
there 0 324 1
was 0 324 1
“no 0 324 1
evidence” 0 324 1
supporting 0 324 1
complaints 0 324 1
against 0 324 1
his 1 324 1
good 1 324 1
friend 1 324 1
Bishop 1 324 1
Juan 1 324 1
Barros? 1 324 1

And, 0 324 2
just 0 324 2
for 0 324 2
good 0 324 2
measure 0 324 2
he 0 324 2
accused 0 324 2
the 0 324 2
people 0 324 2
accusing 0 324 2
him 0 324 2
– 0 324 2
victims 0 324 2
of 0 324 2
sexual 0 324 2
abuse 0 324 2
by 0 324 2
Barros’ 0 324 2

the 1 324 2
convicted 1 324 2
sex-predator 1 324 2
Karadima 1 324 2
– 0 324 2
of 0 324 2
committing 0 324 2
“calumny”? 1 324 2

[1] 0 324 3
And 0 324 3
remember 0 324 3
when 0 324 3
Cardinal 0 324 3
O’Malley 0 324 3
told 0 324 3
the 0 324 3
pope 0 324 3
off 0 324 3
in 0 324 3
public 0 324 3
over 0 324 3
the 0 324 3
“pain” 1 324 3
these 0 324 3
accusations 0 324 3
had 0 324 3
caused 0 324 3
the 0 324 3
victims 0 324 3
of 0 324 3
sexual 0 324 3
abuse? 0 324 3

And 0 324 4
then 0 324 4
remember 0 324 4
how 0 324 4
the 0 324 4
pope 0 324 4
had 1 324 4
apologised-except-not-really 1 324 4
because 0 324 4
the 1 324 4
accusations 1 324 4
are, 1 324 4
after 1 324 4
all, 1 324 4
still 1 324 4
lies, 1 324 4
and 1 324 4
that 1 324 4
there’s 1 324 4
still 1 324 4
“no 1 324 4
evidence” 1 324 4
against 1 324 4
Barros…? 1 324 4

The 0 324 5
press, 0 324 5
secular 0 324 5
as 0 324 5
well 0 324 5
as 0 324 5
Catholic, 0 324 5
is 0 324 5
full 0 324 5
this 0 324 5
week 0 324 5
of 0 324 5
the 0 324 5
story 0 324 5
that 0 324 5
the 0 324 5
pope 0 324 5
did 0 324 5
indeed 0 324 5
see 0 324 5
evidence 0 324 5
of 0 324 5
Barros’ 0 324 5
complicity 0 324 5
in 0 324 5
Karadima’s 0 324 5
sexual 0 324 5
abuse 0 324 5
– 0 324 5
not 0 324 5
only 0 324 5
that 0 324 5
Barros 0 324 5
had 0 324 5
helped 0 324 5
to 0 324 5
cover 0 324 5
it 0 324 5
up 0 324 5
but 0 324 5
that 0 324 5
he 0 324 5
had 0 324 5
been 0 324 5
present 0 324 5
and 0 324 5
a 0 324 5
direct 0 324 5
witness 0 324 5
at 0 324 5
the 0 324 5

a 0 324 5

the 1 324 6

that 0 324 6
the 0 324 6

whom 0 324 6

Pope 0 324 7
Francis 0 324 7
received 0 324 7
a 0 324 7
victim’s 0 324 7
letter 0 324 7
in 0 324 7
2015 0 324 7
that 0 324 7
graphically 0 324 7
detailed 0 324 7
how 0 324 7
a 0 324 7
priest 0 324 7
sexually 0 324 7
abused 0 324 7
him 0 324 7
and 0 324 7
how 0 324 7
other 0 324 7
Chilean 0 324 7
clergy 0 324 7
ignored 0 324 7
it, 0 324 7
contradicting 0 324 7
the 0 324 7
pope’s 0 324 7
recent 0 324 7
insistence 0 324 7
that 0 324 7
no 0 324 7

come 0 324 7
forward 0 324 7
to 0 324 7
denounce 0 324 7
the 0 324 7
cover-up, 0 324 7
the 0 324 7
letter’s 0 324 7
author 0 324 7

The 0 324 8
fact 0 324 8
that 0 324 8

received 0 324 8
the 0 324 8
eight-page 0 324 8
letter, 0 324 8
obtained 0 324 8
by 0 324 8
the 0 324 8

challenges 0 324 8
his 0 324 8

that 0 324 8

It 1 324 9
also 1 324 9
calls 1 324 9
into 1 324 9

Now 0 324 10
it 0 324 10
appears 0 324 10
that 0 324 10

Five 0 324 16
reports, 0 324 16
via 0 324 16
Marco 0 324 16
Tosatti, 0 324 16
that 0 324 16
the 0 324 16
pope 0 324 16
ordered 0 324 16
their 0 324 16
removal 0 324 16

When, 0 324 17
after 0 324 17
several 0 324 17
attempts 0 324 17
and 0 324 17
three 0 324 17
months 0 324 17
later[2], 0 324 17
Muller 0 324 17
was 0 324 17
able 0 324 17
to 0 324 17
get 0 324 17
an 0 324 17
audience 0 324 17
with 0 324 17
the 0 324 17
pope 0 324 17
to 0 324 17
ask 0 324 17
the 0 324 17
reason, 0 324 17
he 0 324 17
received 0 324 17
the 0 324 17
response, 0 324 17
“I 0 324 17
am 1 324 17
the 1 324 17
pope, 1 324 17
I 1 324 17
do 1 324 17
not 1 324 17
need 1 324 17
to 1 324 17
give 1 324 17
reasons 1 324 17
for 1 324 17
any 1 324 17
of 1 324 17
my 1 324 17
decisions. 1 324 17

I 1 324 18
have 1 324 18
decided 1 324 18
that 1 324 18
they 1 324 18
have 1 324 18
to 1 324 18
leave 1 324 18
and 1 324 18
they 1 324 18
have 1 324 18
to 1 324 18
leave.” 1 324 18

Marco 0 324 19
Tosatti 0 324 19
reports 0 324 19
the 0 324 19
CDF 0 324 19
incident, 0 324 19
but 0 324 19
it 0 324 19
follows 0 324 19
an 0 324 19
odd 0 324 19
story 0 324 19
of 0 324 19
a 0 324 19
meeting 0 324 19
of 0 324 19
curial 0 324 19
officials 0 324 19
to 0 324 19
discuss 0 324 19
certain 0 324 19
bishop 0 324 19
appointments. 0 324 19

Without 0 324 20
naming 0 324 20
names, 0 324 20
(or, 0 324 20
frustratingly, 0 324 20
giving 0 324 20
dates[3]) 0 324 20
Tosatti 0 324 20
relates: 0 324 20

“It 0 324 21
was 0 324 21
some 0 324 21
time 0 324 21
ago 0 324 21
to 0 324 21
make 0 324 21
a 0 324 21
bishop, 0 324 21
not 0 324 21
in 0 324 21
Italy. 0 324 21

The 0 324 22
nuncio 0 324 22
has 0 324 22
prepared 0 324 22
the 0 324 22
triad 0 324 22
[the 0 324 22
“terna” 0 324 22
or 0 324 22
list 0 324 22
of 0 324 22
three 0 324 22
candidates]. 0 324 22

A 0 324 23
cardinal, 0 324 23
head 0 324 23
of 0 324 23
the 0 324 23
dicastery, 0 324 23
perhaps 0 324 23
the 0 324 23
same 0 324 23
holder 0 324 23
of 0 324 23
the 0 324 23
Congregation 0 324 23
for 0 324 23
Bishops, 0 324 23
during 0 324 23
the 0 324 23
ordinary 0 324 23
assembly 0 324 23
took 0 324 23
the 0 324 23
floor, 0 324 23
saying: 0 324 23
‘The 0 324 23
first 0 324 23
candidate 0 324 23
indicated 0 324 23
is 0 324 23
excellent, 0 324 23
the 0 324 23
second 0 324 23
is 0 324 23
good. 0 324 23

But 0 324 24
I 0 324 24
would 0 324 24
like 0 324 24
to 0 324 24
warn 0 324 24
of 0 324 24
the 0 324 24
third, 0 324 24
whom 0 324 24
I 0 324 24
know 0 324 24
well, 0 324 24
since 0 324 24
he 0 324 24
was 0 324 24
a 0 324 24
seminarian, 0 324 24
and 0 324 24
who 0 324 24
presents 0 324 24
problems 0 324 24
both 0 324 24
on 0 324 24
the 0 324 24
level 0 324 24
of 0 324 24
doctrine 0 324 24
and 0 324 24
morality. 0 324 24

He 0 324 25
responds 0 324 25
little 0 324 25
to 0 324 25
the 0 324 25
necessary 0 324 25
criteria. 0 324 25

But 0 324 26
the 0 324 26
third 0 324 26
was 0 324 26
a 0 324 26
friend 0 324 26
of 0 324 26
someone 0 324 26
and 0 324 26
another 0 324 26
cardinal, 0 324 26
of 0 324 26
the 0 324 26
circle 0 324 26
currently 0 324 26
in 0 324 26
power, 0 324 26
has 0 324 26
flung 0 324 26
himself 0 324 26
at 0 324 26
his 0 324 26
colleague, 0 324 26
accusing 0 324 26
him 0 324 26
of 0 324 26
impropriety.’ 0 324 26
The 0 324 26
meeting 0 324 26
ended 0 324 26
without 0 324 26
further 0 324 26
decisions.” 0 324 26

Whatever 0 324 27
the 0 324 27
details 0 324 27
of 0 324 27
these 0 324 27
strange 0 324 27
incidents, 0 324 27
what 0 324 27
is 0 324 27
clear 0 324 27
in 0 324 27
Chile 0 324 27
is 0 324 27
that 0 324 27
no 0 324 27
amount 0 324 27
of 0 324 27
eyewitness 0 324 27
testimony 0 324 27
was 0 324 27
going 0 324 27
to 0 324 27
make 0 324 27
the 0 324 27
slightest 0 324 27
difference. 0 324 27

Bergoglio 0 324 28
wanted 0 324 28
Barros 0 324 28
as 0 324 28
a 0 324 28
bishop 0 324 28
and 0 324 28
that 0 324 28
was 0 324 28
that. 0 324 28

Even 0 324 29
while 0 324 29
“apologising” 0 324 29
the 0 324 29
pope 0 324 29
had 0 324 29
doubled 0 324 29
down 0 324 29
when 0 324 29
questioned 0 324 29
about 0 324 29
it 0 324 29
by 0 324 29
journalists, 0 324 29
saying, 0 324 29
“You, 0 324 29
in 0 324 29
all 0 324 29
good 0 324 29
will, 0 324 29
tell 0 324 29
me 0 324 29
that 0 324 29
there 0 324 29
are 0 324 29
victims, 0 324 29
but 0 324 29
I 0 324 29
haven’t 0 324 29
seen 0 324 29
any, 0 324 29
because 0 324 29
they 0 324 29
haven’t 0 324 29
come 0 324 29
forward.” 0 324 29

“In 0 324 30
the 0 324 30
case 0 324 30
of 0 324 30
Barros 0 324 30
it’s 0 324 30
been 0 324 30
observed, 0 324 30
it’s 0 324 30
been 0 324 30
studied; 0 324 30
there’s 0 324 30
no 0 324 30
evidence. 0 324 30

The 0 324 31
best 0 324 31
thing 0 324 31
to 0 324 31
do 0 324 31
if 0 324 31
someone 0 324 31
believes 0 324 31
it’s 0 324 31
the 0 324 31
case 0 324 31
is 0 324 31
to 0 324 31
come 0 324 31

with 0 324 31
evidence.” 0 324 31

The 0 324 32
AP 0 324 32
report, 0 324 32
however, 0 324 32
says 0 324 32
exactly 0 324 32
the 0 324 32
opposite; 0 324 32

On 0 324 35
the 0 324 35

a 0 324 35
few 0 324 35
logical 0 324 35

In 0 324 36
fact, 0 324 36
unless 0 324 36
Cardinal 0 324 36

– 0 324 36

as 0 324 36
of 0 324 36
this 0 324 36

remained 0 324 36
silent 0 324 36
– 0 324 36
comes 0 324 36
forward 0 324 36
and 0 324 36
says 0 324 36
that 0 324 36
he 0 324 36
didn’t 0 324 36
hand 0 324 36
the 0 324 36
letter 0 324 36
over 0 324 36
pope, 0 324 36
there 0 324 36
is 0 324 36
really 0 324 36
only 0 324 36
one; 0 324 36
that 0 324 36
the 0 324 36
pope 0 324 36
lied. 0 324 36

And 0 324 37
this 0 324 37
is 0 324 37
what 0 324 37
is 0 324 37
now 0 324 37
being 0 324 37

“The 0 324 39

the 0 324 40
end 0 324 40
of 0 324 40
last 0 324 40
year. 0 324 40

Vatican 0 324 41

openly 0 324 41
question 0 324 41
whether 0 324 41

and 0 324 41
some 0 324 41

doesn’t.” 0 324 41

“No 0 324 42
evidence…” 0 324 42
Lie 1 324 42
big, 1 324 42
lie 1 324 42
often, 1 324 42
and 1 324 42
when 1 324 42
caught, 1 324 42
keep 1 324 42
lying. 1 324 42

One 0 324 43
of 0 324 43
the 0 324 43
many 0 324 43
things 0 324 43
these 0 324 43

be 0 324 43
paying 0 324 43
attention 0 324 43
to 0 324 43
is 0 324 43
that 0 324 43
“no 0 324 43
evidence” 0 324 43
is 0 324 43
in 0 324 43
fact 0 324 43
a 0 324 43
well-rehearsed, 0 324 43
stock 0 324 43
response 0 324 43
for 0 324 43
Bergoglio. 0 324 43

He 0 324 44
said 0 324 44
almost 0 324 44
exactly 0 324 44
the 0 324 44
same 0 324 44
in 0 324 44
2013 0 324 44
when 0 324 44
confronted 0 324 44
about 0 324 44
another 0 324 44
predatory 1 324 44
homosexual 1 324 44
he 0 324 44
was 0 324 44
sheltering. 0 324 44

The 0 324 45
hoopla 0 324 45
surrounding 0 324 45
the 0 324 45
“Who 1 324 45
am 1 324 45
I 1 324 45
to 1 324 45
judge” 1 324 45
comment 0 324 45
tends 0 324 45
to 0 324 45
obscure 0 324 45
the 0 324 45
context 0 324 45
of 0 324 45
the 0 324 45
comment. 0 324 45

It 0 324 46
was 0 324 46
made 0 324 46
in 0 324 46
response 0 324 46
to 0 324 46
a 0 324 46
question 0 324 46
by 0 324 46
a 0 324 46
journalist 0 324 46
about 0 324 46
Monsignore 0 324 46
Battista 0 324 46
Ricca 0 324 46
– 0 324 46
a 0 324 46
prelate 0 324 46
whose 0 324 46
promiscuous 0 324 46
homosexuality 0 324 46
is 0 324 46
so 0 324 46
well 0 324 46
known 0 324 46
it 0 324 46
was 0 324 46
covered 0 324 46
by 0 324 46
the 0 324 46
Telegraph 0 324 46
as 0 324 46
early 0 324 46
as 0 324 46
July 0 324 46
2013. 0 324 46

Ilze 0 324 47
Scamparini 0 324 47
asked 0 324 47
the 0 324 47
pope 0 324 47
about 0 324 47
Ricca, 0 324 47
saying, 0 324 47
“What 0 324 47
you 0 324 47
intend 0 324 47
to 0 324 47
do 0 324 47
about 0 324 47
this? 0 324 47

How 0 324 48
are 0 324 48
you 0 324 48
confronting 0 324 48
this 0 324 48
issue 0 324 48
and 0 324 48
how 0 324 48
does 0 324 48
Your 0 324 48
Holiness 0 324 48
intend 0 324 48
to 0 324 48
confront 0 324 48
the 0 324 48
whole 0 324 48
question 0 324 48
of 0 324 48
the 0 324 48
gay 0 324 48
lobby?” 0 324 48

What 0 324 49
reply 0 324 49
did 0 324 49
Bergoglio 0 324 49
give? 0 324 49

His 0 324 50
standard 0 324 50
one: 0 324 50
“No 1 324 50
evidence.” 1 324 50

About 0 324 51
Monsignor 0 324 51
Ricca: 0 324 51
I 0 324 51
did 0 324 51
what 0 324 51
canon 0 324 51
law 0 324 51
calls 0 324 51
for, 0 324 51
that 0 324 51
is 0 324 51
a 0 324 51
preliminary 0 324 51
investigation. 0 324 51

And 0 324 52
from 0 324 52
this 0 324 52
investigation, 0 324 52
there 0 324 52
was 0 324 52
nothing 0 324 52
of 0 324 52
what 0 324 52
had 0 324 52
been 0 324 52
alleged. 0 324 52

We 0 324 53
did 0 324 53
not 0 324 53
find 0 324 53
anything 0 324 53
of 0 324 53
that. 0 324 53

This 0 324 54
is 0 324 54
the 0 324 54
response.” 0 324 54

He 0 324 55
added, 0 324 55
“In 0 324 55
this 0 324 55
case, 0 324 55
I 0 324 55
conducted 0 324 55
the 0 324 55
preliminary 0 324 55
investigation 0 324 55
and 0 324 55
we 0 324 55
didn’t 0 324 55
find 0 324 55
anything.” 0 324 55

But 0 324 56
Ricca’s 0 324 56
activities, 0 324 56
for 0 324 56
which 0 324 56
the 0 324 56
pope 0 324 56
claimed 0 324 56
there 0 324 56
was 0 324 56
no 0 324 56
evidence, 0 324 56
were 0 324 56
notorious. 0 324 56

They 0 324 57
include 0 324 57
being 0 324 57
caught 0 324 57
in 0 324 57
flagrante 0 324 57
in 0 324 57
an 0 324 57
elevator 0 324 57
with 0 324 57
a 0 324 57
teenaged 0 324 57
male 0 324 57
prostitute, 0 324 57
and 0 324 57
his 0 324 57
sexual 0 324 57
relationship 0 324 57
with 0 324 57
a 0 324 57
captain 0 324 57
in 0 324 57
the 0 324 57
Swiss 0 324 57
army. 0 324 57

So 0 324 58
flagrant 1 324 58
was 0 324 58
Ricca’s 0 324 58
behaviour 0 324 58
that 0 324 58
it 0 324 58
took 0 324 58
intervention 0 324 58
by 0 324 58
Uruguay’s 0 324 58
nuncio 0 324 58
to 0 324 58
have 0 324 58
him 0 324 58
removed. 0 324 58

It 0 324 59
was 0 324 59
reported 0 324 59
in 0 324 59
1999 0 324 59
and 0 324 59
2000 0 324 59
by 0 324 59
L’Espresso, 0 324 59
who 0 324 59
said 0 324 59
the 0 324 59
information 0 324 59
was 0 324 59
confirmed 0 324 59
by 0 324 59
“numerous 0 324 59
bishops, 0 324 59
priests, 0 324 59
religious 0 324 59
and 0 324 59
laity” 0 324 59
in 0 324 59
Uruguay[6]. 0 324 59

In 0 324 60
fact, 0 324 60
the 0 324 60
evidence 0 324 60
shows 0 324 60
that 0 324 60
Ricca 0 324 60
is 0 324 60
completely 0 324 60
in 0 324 60
line 0 324 60
with 0 324 60
Bergoglio’s 0 324 60
normal 0 324 60
procedures. 0 324 60

As 0 324 61
“Marcantonio 0 324 61
Colonna” 0 324 61
wrote 0 324 61
in 0 324 61
the 0 324 61
Dictator 0 324 61
Pope, 0 324 61
“In 0 324 61
fact 0 324 61
his 0 324 61
patronage 0 324 61
of 0 324 61
Monsignor 0 324 61
Ricca 0 324 61
fits 0 324 61
the 0 324 61
pattern 0 324 61
which 0 324 61
was 0 324 61
well 0 324 61
established 0 324 61
when 0 324 61
he 0 324 61
was 0 324 61
Archbishop 0 324 61
of 0 324 61
Buenos 0 324 61
Aires, 0 324 61
whereby 0 324 61
he 0 324 61
surrounds 0 324 61
himself 0 324 61
with 0 324 61
morally 0 324 61
weak 0 324 61
people 0 324 61
so 0 324 61
as 0 324 61
to 0 324 61
have 0 324 61
them 0 324 61
under 1 324 61
his 1 324 61
thumb.” 1 324 61

It 0 324 62
was 0 324 62
at 0 324 62
this 0 324 62
early 0 324 62
“no 0 324 62
evidence” 0 324 62
comment 0 324 62
on 0 324 62
the 0 324 62
plane 0 324 62
home 0 324 62
from 0 324 62
Rio 0 324 62
that 0 324 62
some 0 324 62
of 0 324 62
those 0 324 62
paying 0 324 62
attention 0 324 62
started 0 324 62
to 0 324 62
understand 0 324 62
that 0 324 62
Bergoglio’s 0 324 62
policy 0 324 62
is 0 324 62
in 0 324 62
line 0 324 62
with 0 324 62
that 0 324 62
of 0 324 62
certain 0 324 62
leaders 0 324 62
of 0 324 62
the 0 324 62
past 0 324 62
who 0 324 62
recommended 0 324 62
that 0 324 62
if 0 324 62
a 0 324 62
politician 0 324 62
was 0 324 62
going 0 324 62
to 0 324 62
lie, 0 324 62
he 0 324 62
should 0 324 62
lie 1 324 62
big 1 324 62
and 1 324 62
lie 1 324 62
brazenly. 1 324 62

And 0 324 63
in 0 324 63
case 0 324 63
anyone 0 324 63
was 0 324 63
wondering 0 324 63
what 0 324 63
will 0 324 63
happen 0 324 63
next, 0 324 63
the 0 324 63
same 0 324 63
advice 0 324 63
said 0 324 63
to 0 324 63
keep 0 324 63
on 0 324 63
lying 0 324 63
after 0 324 63
you’re 0 324 63
caught. 0 324 63

The 0 324 64
pattern 0 324 64
of 0 324 64
silence 0 324 64
and, 0 324 64
when 0 324 64
pressed, 0 324 64
flat-out 0 324 64
denial 0 324 64
has 0 324 64
been 0 324 64
Bergoglio’s 0 324 64
policy 0 324 64
since 0 324 64
long 0 324 64
before 0 324 64
he 0 324 64
came 0 324 64
on 0 324 64
the 0 324 64
international 0 324 64
scene. 0 324 64

He 0 324 65
has 0 324 65
a 0 324 65
long 0 324 65
record 0 324 65
in 0 324 65
Argentina 0 324 65
of 0 324 65
shaving 0 324 65
close 0 324 65
to 0 324 65
scandals 0 324 65
and 0 324 65
vociferously 0 324 65
denying 0 324 65
involvement, 0 324 65
and 0 324 65
relying 0 324 65
heavily 0 324 65
on 0 324 65
the 0 324 65
broad 0 324 65
good 0 324 65
will 0 324 65
of 0 324 65
Catholics 0 324 65
towards 0 324 65
bishops 0 324 65
to 0 324 65
pull 0 324 65
it 0 324 65
off. 0 324 65

Perhaps 0 324 66
his 0 324 66
biggest 0 324 66
error 0 324 66
with 0 324 66
Barros 0 324 66
was 0 324 66
failing 0 324 66
to 0 324 66
understand 0 324 66
just 0 324 66
how 0 324 66
little 0 324 66
of 0 324 66
that 0 324 66
capital 0 324 66
of 0 324 66
trust 0 324 66
there 0 324 66
is 0 324 66
left 0 324 66
in 0 324 66
the 0 324 66
Catholic 0 324 66
world 0 324 66
as 0 324 66
a 0 324 66
whole. 0 324 66

Indeed, 0 324 67
on 0 324 67
the 0 324 67
subject 0 324 67
of 0 324 67
priests 0 324 67
sexually 0 324 67
abusing 0 324 67
young 0 324 67
people, 0 324 67
it 0 324 67
could 0 324 67
only 0 324 67
be 0 324 67
measured 0 324 67
in 0 324 67
the 0 324 67
negative 0 324 67
numbers. 0 324 67

“Argentine 0 324 68

“In 0 324 75

it 0 324 75
never 0 324 75

to 0 324 75
me, 0 324 75

a 0 324 75
bishop 0 324 75

added 0 324 75
that 0 324 75
he 0 324 75
agreed 0 324 75
with 0 324 75
the 0 324 75
“zero 0 324 75
tolerance” 0 324 75
attitude 0 324 75
of 0 324 75
the 0 324 75
Irish 0 324 75
episcopate 0 324 75
and 0 324 75
admired 0 324 75
Pope 0 324 75
Benedict’s 0 324 75
reforms 0 324 75
– 0 324 75
most 0 324 75
of 0 324 75
which 0 324 75
he 0 324 75
was 0 324 75
later 0 324 75
to 0 324 75
quietly 0 324 75
reverse. 0 324 75

It 0 324 76
was 0 324 76
at 0 324 76
exactly 0 324 76
this 0 324 76
time, 0 324 76
however, 0 324 76
that 0 324 76
victims 0 324 76
from 0 324 76
Argentina 0 324 76
were 0 324 76
attempting 0 324 76
to 0 324 76
get 0 324 76
the 0 324 76
new 0 324 76
pope’s 0 324 76
attention. 0 324 76

One, 0 324 77
known 0 324 77
to 0 324 77
the 0 324 77
press 0 324 77
only 0 324 77
as 0 324 77
“Gabriel,” 0 324 77
wanted 0 324 77
to 0 324 77
talk 0 324 77
to 0 324 77
Francis 0 324 77
about 0 324 77
the 0 324 77
sexual 0 324 77
abuse 0 324 77
he 0 324 77
suffered 0 324 77
at 0 324 77
the 0 324 77
hands 0 324 77
of 0 324 77
Julio 0 324 77
César 0 324 77
Grassi, 0 324 77
accused 0 324 77
of 0 324 77
molesting 0 324 77
at 0 324 77
least 0 324 77
five 0 324 77
boys, 0 324 77
“who 0 324 77
has 0 324 77
been 0 324 77
avoiding 0 324 77
the 0 324 77

Court 0 324 77

judges 0 324 78
and 0 324 78
prosecutors 0 324 78
at 0 324 78
all 0 324 78

found 0 324 78
him 0 324 78
guilty.” 0 324 78

case 0 324 79
anyone 0 324 79
thinks 0 324 79
the 0 324 79
Grassi-Gabriel 0 324 79
case 0 324 79
was 0 324 79
not 0 324 79
serious 0 324 79
enough 0 324 79
for 0 324 79

The 0 324 82
group 0 324 82
surmises 0 324 82
that 0 324 82
it 0 324 82
was 0 324 82

direct 0 324 82
intervention 0 324 82
with 0 324 82

prevented 0 324 82
a 0 324 82
conviction 0 324 82

Grassi 0 324 82
for 0 324 82

long 0 324 82

delayed 0 324 82
his 0 324 82
sentencing 0 324 82
through 0 324 82
multiple 0 324 82
appeals. 0 324 82

In 0 324 83
2006, 0 324 83
then-Archbishop 0 324 83
Bergoglio 0 324 83
complained 0 324 83
of 0 324 83
a 0 324 83
“media 0 324 83
campaign” 0 324 83
and 0 324 83
claimed 0 324 83
that 0 324 83
the 0 324 83
Grassi 0 324 83
case 0 324 83
was 0 324 83
“different” 0 324 83
from 0 324 83

accusations. 0 324 83

During 0 324 84
his 0 324 84
criminal 0 324 84
trial 0 324 84
Grassi 0 324 84
said 0 324 84
Bergoglio 0 324 84
“never 0 324 84

of 0 324 84

In 0 324 85

performance-liar 1 324 87

Looking 0 324 88
back 0 324 88
and 0 324 88
carefully 0 324 88
examining 0 324 88
his 0 324 88
record, 0 324 88
Jorge 0 324 88
Bergoglio’s 0 324 88
mastery 1 324 88
of 0 324 88
using 0 324 88
the 0 324 88
weaknesses 0 324 88
of 0 324 88
morally 0 324 88
compromised 0 324 88
men 0 324 88
is 0 324 88
becoming 0 324 88
evident. 0 324 88

It 0 324 89
is 0 324 89
arguable 0 324 89
that 0 324 89
even 0 324 89
the 0 324 89
members 0 324 89
of 0 324 89
the 0 324 89
so-called 0 324 89
“San 0 324 89
Gallen 0 324 89
Mafia” 0 324 89
who 0 324 89
apparently 0 324 89
conspired 0 324 89
to 0 324 89
put 0 324 89
him 0 324 89
on 0 324 89
Peter’s 0 324 89
throne 0 324 89
were 0 324 89
used 0 324 89
by 0 324 89
him. 0 324 89

But 0 324 90
he 0 324 90
is 0 324 90
also 0 324 90
a 0 324 90
master 0 324 90
of 0 324 90
judging 0 324 90
an 0 324 90
audience 0 324 90
and 0 324 90
telling 0 324 90
them 0 324 90
what 0 324 90
they 0 324 90
expect 0 324 90
to 0 324 90
hear; 0 324 90
a 0 324 90
key 0 324 90
skill 0 324 90
for 0 324 90
all 0 324 90
grifters 0 324 90
and 0 324 90
confidence 0 324 90
tricksters. 0 324 90

Looking 0 324 91
carefully 0 324 91
at 0 324 91
the 0 324 91
infamous 0 324 91
“Who 0 324 91
am 0 324 91
I 0 324 91
to 0 324 91
judge” 0 324 91
comment, 0 324 91
this 0 324 91
was 0 324 91
clear 0 324 91
early 0 324 91
on. 0 324 91

The 0 324 92
first 0 324 92
part 0 324 92
of 0 324 92
that 0 324 92
interview 0 324 92
is 0 324 92
a 0 324 92
blatant 1 324 92
and 1 324 92
enormous 1 324 92
lie, 1 324 92
and 0 324 92
it 0 324 92
was 0 324 92
from 0 324 92
there 0 324 92
that 0 324 92
the 0 324 92
pope 0 324 92
moved 0 324 92
on 0 324 92
to 0 324 92
his 0 324 92
apology 0 324 92
for 0 324 92
homosexuality 0 324 92
in 0 324 92
general. 0 324 92

Recall 0 324 93
that 0 324 93
this 0 324 93
was 0 324 93
the 0 324 93
very 0 324 93
first 0 324 93
airplane 0 324 93
interview, 0 324 93
on 0 324 93
the 0 324 93
trip 0 324 93
back 0 324 93
to 0 324 93
Rome 0 324 93
from 0 324 93
World 0 324 93
Youth 0 324 93
Day 0 324 93
in 0 324 93
Rio, 0 324 93
a 0 324 93
matter 0 324 93
of 0 324 93
weeks 0 324 93
after 0 324 93
his 0 324 93
election. 0 324 93

At 0 324 94
the 0 324 94
time, 0 324 94
the 0 324 94
papal 1 324 94
apologists 1 324 94
sprang 0 324 94
instantly 0 324 94
into 0 324 94
action 0 324 94
and 0 324 94
we 0 324 94
heard 0 324 94
all 0 324 94
about 0 324 94
how 0 324 94
the 0 324 94
pope 0 324 94
was 0 324 94
talking 0 324 94
strictly 0 324 94
within 0 324 94
the 0 324 94
boundaries 0 324 94
of 0 324 94
Catholic 0 324 94
doctrine. 0 324 94

But 0 324 95
perhaps 0 324 95
in 0 324 95
hindsight, 0 324 95
we 0 324 95
are 0 324 95
ready 0 324 95
to 0 324 95
examine 0 324 95
the 0 324 95
full 0 324 95
implications 0 324 95
of 0 324 95
his 0 324 95
little 0 324 95
speech, 0 324 95
one 0 324 95
that 0 324 95
was 0 324 95
clearly 0 324 95
well-rehearsed. 0 324 95

(Don’t 0 324 96
forget, 0 324 96
no 0 324 96
question 0 324 96
is 0 324 96
asked 0 324 96
in 0 324 96
a 0 324 96
papal 0 324 96
interview 0 324 96
without 0 324 96
being 0 324 96
thoroughly 1 324 96
vetted 1 324 96
ahead 0 324 96
of 0 324 96
time. 0 324 96

Journalists 0 324 97
must 0 324 97
submit 0 324 97
their 0 324 97
questions 0 324 97
well 0 324 97
in 0 324 97
advance.) 0 324 97

This 0 324 98
was 0 324 98
the 0 324 98
pope 0 324 98
laying 0 324 98
out 0 324 98
his 0 324 98
policy 0 324 98
regarding 0 324 98
homosexuality, 0 324 98
a 0 324 98
policy 0 324 98
for 0 324 98
which 0 324 98
he 0 324 98
was 0 324 98
duly 1 324 98
rewarded 1 324 98
by 0 324 98
being 0 324 98
lauded 0 324 98
on 0 324 98
the 0 324 98
cover 0 324 98
of 0 324 98
the 0 324 98
homosexualist 0 324 98
lobby’s 0 324 98
US 0 324 98
trade 0 324 98
magazine. 0 324 98

Read 0 324 99
his 0 324 99
full 0 324 99
answer 0 324 99
carefully: 0 324 99

I 0 324 100
see 0 324 100
that 0 324 100
many 0 324 100
times 0 324 100
in 0 324 100
the 0 324 100
Church, 0 324 100
over 0 324 100
and 0 324 100
above 0 324 100
this 0 324 100
case, 0 324 100
but 0 324 100
including 0 324 100
this 0 324 100
case, 0 324 100
people 0 324 100
search 0 324 100
for 0 324 100
“sins 0 324 100
from 0 324 100
youth”, 0 324 100
for 0 324 100
example, 0 324 100
and 0 324 100
then 0 324 100
publish 0 324 100
them. 0 324 100

They 0 324 101
are 0 324 101
not 0 324 101
crimes, 0 324 101
right? 0 324 101

Crimes 0 324 102
are 0 324 102
something 0 324 102
different: 0 324 102
the 0 324 102
abuse 0 324 102
of 0 324 102
minors 0 324 102
is 0 324 102
a 0 324 102
crime. 0 324 102

No, 0 324 103
sins. 0 324 103

But 0 324 104
if 0 324 104
a 0 324 104
person, 0 324 104
whether 0 324 104
it 0 324 104
be 0 324 104
a 0 324 104
lay 0 324 104
person, 0 324 104
a 0 324 104
priest 0 324 104
or 0 324 104
a 0 324 104
religious 0 324 104
sister, 0 324 104
commits 0 324 104
a 0 324 104
sin 0 324 104
and 0 324 104
then 0 324 104
converts, 0 324 104
the 0 324 104
Lord 0 324 104
forgives, 0 324 104
and 0 324 104
when 0 324 104
the 0 324 104
Lord 0 324 104
forgives, 0 324 104
the 0 324 104
Lord 0 324 104
forgets 0 324 104
and 0 324 104
this 0 324 104
is 0 324 104
very 0 324 104
important 0 324 104
for 0 324 104
our 0 324 104
lives. 0 324 104

When 0 324 105
we 0 324 105
confess 0 324 105
our 0 324 105
sins 0 324 105
and 0 324 105
we 0 324 105
truly 0 324 105
say, 0 324 105
“I 0 324 105
have 0 324 105
sinned 0 324 105
in 0 324 105
this”, 0 324 105
the 0 324 105
Lord 0 324 105
forgets, 0 324 105
and 0 324 105
so 0 324 105
we 0 324 105
have 0 324 105
no 0 324 105
right 0 324 105
not 0 324 105
to 0 324 105
forget, 0 324 105
because 0 324 105
otherwise 0 324 105
we 0 324 105
would 0 324 105
run 0 324 105
the 0 324 105
risk 0 324 105
of 0 324 105
the 0 324 105
Lord 0 324 105
not 0 324 105
forgetting 0 324 105
our 0 324 105
sins. 0 324 105

That 1 324 106
is 1 324 106
a 1 324 106
danger. 1 324 106

This 0 324 107
is 0 324 107
important: 0 324 107
a 0 324 107
theology 0 324 107
of 0 324 107
sin. 0 324 107

Many 0 324 108
times 0 324 108
I 0 324 108
think 0 324 108
of 0 324 108
Saint 0 324 108
Peter. 0 324 108

He 0 324 109
committed 0 324 109
one 0 324 109
of 0 324 109
the 0 324 109
worst 0 324 109
sins, 0 324 109
that 0 324 109
is 0 324 109
he 0 324 109
denied 0 324 109
Christ, 0 324 109
and 0 324 109
even 0 324 109
with 0 324 109
this 0 324 109
sin 0 324 109
they 0 324 109
made 0 324 109
him 0 324 109
Pope. 0 324 109

We 0 324 110
have 0 324 110
to 0 324 110
think 0 324 110
a 0 324 110
great 0 324 110
deal 0 324 110
about 0 324 110
that. 0 324 110

But, 0 324 111
returning 0 324 111
to 0 324 111
your 0 324 111
question 0 324 111
more 0 324 111
concretely. 0 324 111

In 0 324 112
this 0 324 112
case, 0 324 112
I 0 324 112
conducted 0 324 112
the 0 324 112
preliminary 0 324 112
investigation 0 324 112
and 0 324 112
we 0 324 112
didn’t 0 324 112
find 0 324 112
anything. 0 324 112

This 0 324 113
is 0 324 113
the 0 324 113
first 0 324 113
question. 0 324 113

Then, 0 324 114
you 0 324 114
spoke 0 324 114
about 0 324 114
the 0 324 114
gay 0 324 114
lobby. 0 324 114

So 0 324 115
much 0 324 115
is 0 324 115
written 0 324 115
about 0 324 115
the 0 324 115
gay 0 324 115
lobby. 0 324 115

I 0 324 116
still 0 324 116
haven’t 0 324 116
found 0 324 116
anyone 0 324 116
with 0 324 116
an 0 324 116
identity 0 324 116
card 0 324 116
in 0 324 116
the 0 324 116
Vatican 0 324 116
with 0 324 116
“gay” 0 324 116
on 0 324 116
it. 0 324 116

They 0 324 117
say 0 324 117
there 0 324 117
are 0 324 117
some 0 324 117
there. 0 324 117

I 0 324 118
believe 0 324 118
that 0 324 118
when 0 324 118
you 0 324 118
are 0 324 118
dealing 0 324 118
with 0 324 118
such 0 324 118
a 0 324 118
person, 0 324 118
you 0 324 118
must 0 324 118
distinguish 0 324 118
between 0 324 118
the 0 324 118
fact 0 324 118
of 0 324 118
a 0 324 118
person 0 324 118
being 0 324 118
gay 0 324 118
and 0 324 118
the 0 324 118
fact 0 324 118
of 0 324 118
someone 0 324 118
forming 0 324 118
a 0 324 118
lobby, 0 324 118
because 0 324 118
not 0 324 118
all 0 324 118
lobbies 0 324 118
are 0 324 118
good. 0 324 118

This 0 324 119
one 0 324 119
is 0 324 119
not 0 324 119
good. 0 324 119

If 0 324 120
someone 0 324 120
is 0 324 120
gay 0 324 120
and 0 324 120
is 0 324 120
searching 0 324 120
for 0 324 120
the 0 324 120
Lord 0 324 120
and 0 324 120
has 0 324 120
good 0 324 120
will, 0 324 120
then 0 324 120
who 1 324 120
am 1 324 120
I 1 324 120
to 1 324 120
judge 1 324 120
him? 1 324 120

The 0 324 121
Catechism 0 324 121
of 0 324 121
the 0 324 121
Catholic 0 324 121
Church 0 324 121
explains 0 324 121
this 0 324 121
in 0 324 121
a 0 324 121
beautiful 0 324 121
way, 0 324 121
saying 0 324 121
... 0 324 121
wait 0 324 121
a 0 324 121
moment, 0 324 121
how 0 324 121
does 0 324 121
it 0 324 121
say 0 324 121
it 0 324 121
... 0 324 121
it 0 324 121
says: 0 324 121
“no 0 324 121
one 0 324 121
should 0 324 121
marginalize 0 324 121
these 0 324 121
people 0 324 121
for 0 324 121
this, 0 324 121
they 0 324 121
must 0 324 121
be 0 324 121
integrated 0 324 121
into 0 324 121
society”. 0 324 121

The 0 324 122
problem 0 324 122
is 0 324 122
not 0 324 122
having 0 324 122
this 0 324 122
tendency, 0 324 122
no, 0 324 122
we 0 324 122
must 0 324 122
be 0 324 122
brothers 0 324 122
and 0 324 122
sisters 0 324 122
to 0 324 122
one 0 324 122
another, 0 324 122
and 0 324 122
there 0 324 122
is 0 324 122
this 0 324 122
one 0 324 122
and 0 324 122
there 0 324 122
is 0 324 122
that 0 324 122
one. 0 324 122

The 0 324 123
problem 0 324 123
is 0 324 123
in 0 324 123
making 0 324 123
a 0 324 123
lobby 0 324 123
of 0 324 123
this 0 324 123
tendency: 0 324 123
a 0 324 123
lobby 0 324 123
of 0 324 123
misers, 0 324 123
a 0 324 123
lobby 0 324 123
of 0 324 123
politicians, 0 324 123
a 0 324 123
lobby 0 324 123
of 0 324 123
masons, 0 324 123
so 1 324 123
many 1 324 123
lobbies. 1 324 123

For 0 324 124
me, 0 324 124
this 0 324 124
is 0 324 124
the 0 324 124
greater 0 324 124
problem. 0 324 124

Thank 0 324 125
you 0 324 125
so 0 324 125
much 0 324 125
for 0 324 125
asking 0 324 125
this 0 324 125
question. 0 324 125

Many 0 324 126
thanks. 0 324 126

One 0 324 127
of 0 324 127
the 0 324 127
pope’s 0 324 127
favourite 0 324 127
rhetorical 0 324 127
techniques 0 324 127
is 0 324 127
a 0 324 127
combination 0 324 127
of 0 324 127
Begging 0 324 127
the 0 324 127
Question 0 324 127
and 0 324 127
conspiracy. 0 324 127

He 0 324 128
starts 0 324 128
by 0 324 128
assuming, 0 324 128
without 0 324 128
any 0 324 128
effort 0 324 128
at 0 324 128
defence 0 324 128
or 0 324 128
explanation, 0 324 128
a 0 324 128
point 0 324 128
that 0 324 128
concedes 0 324 128
the 0 324 128
whole 0 324 128
issue. 0 324 128

This 0 324 129
was 0 324 129
the 0 324 129
first 0 324 129
time 0 324 129
a 0 324 129
pope 0 324 129
had 0 324 129
ever 0 324 129
used 0 324 129
the 0 324 129
political 0 324 129
term 0 324 129
“gay”. 0 324 129

Not 0 324 130
“homosexual,” 0 324 130
not 0 324 130
“same-sex 0 324 130
attracted,” 0 324 130
but 0 324 130
“gay,” 0 324 130
meaning 0 324 130
that 0 324 130
he 0 324 130
started 0 324 130
by 0 324 130
adopting 0 324 130
the 0 324 130
entirety 0 324 130
of 0 324 130
the 0 324 130
homosexualist 0 324 130
movement’s 0 324 130
linguistic 0 324 130
manipulations. 0 324 130

Language 0 324 131
counts 0 324 131
in 0 324 131
politics, 0 324 131
and 0 324 131
a 0 324 131
pope 0 324 131
using 0 324 131
that 0 324 131
term 0 324 131
means 0 324 131
he 0 324 131
is 0 324 131
by 0 324 131
implication 0 324 131
starting 0 324 131
the 0 324 131
discussion 0 324 131
– 0 324 131
and 0 324 131
his 0 324 131
pontificate 0 324 131
– 0 324 131
by 0 324 131
aligning 0 324 131
himself 0 324 131
with 0 324 131
the 0 324 131
basic 0 324 131
tenets 0 324 131
of 0 324 131
a 0 324 131
movement 0 324 131
that 0 324 131
is 0 324 131
violently 1 324 131
opposed 1 324 131
to 0 324 131
Catholic 0 324 131
moral 0 324 131
teaching, 0 324 131
and 0 324 131
in 0 324 131
direct 0 324 131
opposition 0 324 131
to 0 324 131
his 0 324 131
immediate, 0 324 131
and 0 324 131
still 0 324 131
living, 0 324 131
predecessor. 0 324 131

In 0 324 132
this 0 324 132
case 0 324 132
too, 0 324 132
he 0 324 132
was 0 324 132
addressing 0 324 132
a 0 324 132
plane 0 324 132
load 0 324 132
of 0 324 132
journalists 0 324 132
who 0 324 132
were 0 324 132
either 0 324 132
secular 0 324 132
themselves, 0 324 132
or 0 324 132
for 0 324 132
the 0 324 132
most 0 324 132
part 0 324 132
are 0 324 132
the 0 324 132
kind 0 324 132
of 0 324 132
Catholic 0 324 132
who 0 324 132
believes 0 324 132
it 0 324 132
is 0 324 132
fine 0 324 132
to 0 324 132
“disagree” 0 324 132
with 0 324 132
Catholic 0 324 132
teaching 0 324 132
on 0 324 132
sexuality. 0 324 132

There 0 324 133
are 0 324 133
very 0 324 133
few 0 324 133
“conservative” 0 324 133
Catholics 0 324 133
in 0 324 133
the 0 324 133
Vatican 0 324 133
journalist 0 324 133
pool. 0 324 133

This 0 324 134
means 0 324 134
that 0 324 134
his 0 324 134
use 0 324 134
of 0 324 134
this 0 324 134
language 0 324 134
was 0 324 134
a 0 324 134
conspiratorial 0 324 134
wink 0 324 134
and 0 324 134
nod 0 324 134
to 0 324 134
his 0 324 134
immediate 0 324 134
audience, 0 324 134
a 0 324 134
sly 0 324 134
message 0 324 134
to 0 324 134
say, 0 324 134
“People 0 324 134
talk 0 324 134
all 0 324 134
the 0 324 134
time 0 324 134
about 0 324 134
a 0 324 134
gay 0 324 134
lobby, 0 324 134
but 0 324 134
you 0 324 134
and 0 324 134
I 0 324 134
both 0 324 134
know 0 324 134
this 0 324 134
is 0 324 134
mostly 0 324 134
nonsense, 1 324 134
propaganda 1 324 134
from 0 324 134
those 0 324 134
people… 0 324 134
those 0 324 134
conservatives…We 0 324 134
cool 1 324 134
and 1 324 134
hip 1 324 134
people 1 324 134
don’t 1 324 134
hate 1 324 134
gays, 1 324 134
do 1 324 134
we?” 1 324 134

This 0 324 135
astonishing 0 324 135
departure 0 324 135
follows 0 324 135
an 0 324 135
implied 0 324 135
but 0 324 135
very 0 324 135
clear 0 324 135
assertion 0 324 135
that 0 324 135
Ricca 0 324 135
has 0 324 135
repented 0 324 135
and 0 324 135
given 0 324 135
up 0 324 135
his 0 324 135
activity, 0 324 135
an 0 324 135
assertion 0 324 135
that 0 324 135
has 0 324 135
absolutely 0 324 135
no 0 324 135
evidence 0 324 135
to 0 324 135
back 0 324 135
it 0 324 135
up. 0 324 135

We 1 324 136
are 1 324 136
simply 1 324 136
asked 1 324 136
to 1 324 136
take 1 324 136
the 1 324 136
pope’s 1 324 136
word 1 324 136
for 1 324 136
it, 1 324 136
but 0 324 136
given 0 324 136
that 0 324 136
it 0 324 136
follows 0 324 136
his 0 324 136
astoundingly 1 324 136
brazen 1 324 136
lie 1 324 136
that 0 324 136
there 0 324 136
was 0 324 136
no 0 324 136
evidence 0 324 136
for 0 324 136
Ricca’s 0 324 136
homosexual 0 324 136
activity 0 324 136
in 0 324 136
the 0 324 136
first 0 324 136
place, 0 324 136
we 0 324 136
can 0 324 136
take 0 324 136
the 0 324 136
assurance 0 324 136
for 0 324 136
what 0 324 136
it 0 324 136
seems 0 324 136
to 0 324 136
be 0 324 136
worth. 0 324 136

Next, 0 324 137
after 0 324 137
another 0 324 137
little 0 324 137
inside 0 324 137
nudge-nudge-wink-wink 1 324 137
joke 1 324 137
about 0 324 137
the 0 324 137
“gay 0 324 137
lobby” 0 324 137
– 0 324 137
implying 0 324 137
(but 0 324 137
of 0 324 137
course 0 324 137
never 0 324 137
outright 0 324 137
saying) 0 324 137
that 0 324 137
the 0 324 137
whole 0 324 137
thing 0 324 137
is 0 324 137
hysterical 1 324 137
nonsense 1 324 137
– 0 324 137
we 0 324 137
hear 0 324 137
a 0 324 137
direct 0 324 137
contradiction 0 324 137
to 0 324 137
Catholic 0 324 137
teaching 0 324 137
from 0 324 137
no 0 324 137
less 0 324 137
a 0 324 137
source 0 324 137
than 0 324 137
his 0 324 137
predecessor, 0 324 137
Pope 0 324 137
Benedict 0 324 137
Ratzinger. 0 324 137

“The 0 324 138
problem 0 324 138
is 0 324 138
not 0 324 138
having 0 324 138
this 0 324 138
tendency.” 0 324 138
Well, 0 324 138
actually, 0 324 138
your 0 324 138
holiness, 0 324 138
yes 0 324 138
it 0 324 138
is, 0 324 138
particularly 0 324 138
in 0 324 138
the 0 324 138
case 0 324 138
of 0 324 138
priests. 0 324 138

The 0 324 139
“tendency” 0 324 139
is 0 324 139
called 0 324 139
in 0 324 139
the 0 324 139
same 0 324 139
catechism 0 324 139
you 0 324 139
quote 0 324 139
“intrinsically 1 324 139
disordered” 1 324 139
and 0 324 139
Ratzinger 0 324 139
was 0 324 139
very 0 324 139
clear 0 324 139
that 0 324 139
this 0 324 139
“tendency” 0 324 139
is 0 324 139
a 0 324 139
sign 0 324 139
of 0 324 139
a 1 324 139
serious 1 324 139
emotional 1 324 139
dysfunction 1 324 139
that 1 324 139
“must” 1 324 139
preclude 1 324 139
a 1 324 139
man 1 324 139
from 1 324 139
being 1 324 139
ordained. 1 324 139

Squandering 1 324 140
the 1 324 140
capital 1 324 140
of 1 324 140
trust 1 324 140

A 0 324 141
few 0 324 141
months 0 324 141
ago 0 324 141
in 0 324 141
a 0 324 141
piece 0 324 141
for 0 324 141
the 0 324 141
Remnant, 0 324 141
I 0 324 141
talked 0 324 141
about 0 324 141
why 0 324 141
the 0 324 141
Church 0 324 141
(and 0 324 141
nearly 0 324 141
all 0 324 141
human 0 324 141
societies) 0 324 141
regard 0 324 141
lying 0 324 141
as 0 324 141
a 0 324 141
sin: 0 324 141

A 0 324 142
mistake 0 324 142
many 0 324 142
make 0 324 142
about 0 324 142
lying 0 324 142
is 0 324 142
to 0 324 142
understand 0 324 142
it 0 324 142
only 0 324 142
in 0 324 142
terms 0 324 142
of 0 324 142
morality. 0 324 142

But 0 324 143
Thomas 0 324 143
makes 0 324 143
the 0 324 143
point 0 324 143
that 0 324 143
it 0 324 143
is 0 324 143
first 0 324 143
a 0 324 143
matter 0 324 143
of 0 324 143
metaphysics. 0 324 143

Lying 0 324 144
is 0 324 144
an 0 324 144
act 0 324 144
at 0 324 144
variance 0 324 144
in 0 324 144
its 0 324 144
essence 0 324 144
with 0 324 144
the 0 324 144
nature 0 324 144
of 0 324 144
reality. 0 324 144

Thomistic 0 324 145
theology 0 324 145
teaches 0 324 145
that 0 324 145
it 0 324 145
is 0 324 145
by 0 324 145
lying 0 324 145
that 0 324 145
we 0 324 145
become 0 324 145
most 0 324 145
like 0 324 145
the 0 324 145
devil, 0 324 145
and 0 324 145
most 0 324 145
unlike 0 324 145
God, 0 324 145
because 0 324 145
we 0 324 145
are 0 324 145
trying 0 324 145
to 0 324 145
change 0 324 145
the 0 324 145
nature 0 324 145
of 0 324 145
reality 0 324 145
to 0 324 145
suit 0 324 145
our 0 324 145
own 0 324 145
purposes. 0 324 145

Habitual 0 324 146
lying 0 324 146
in 0 324 146
effect 0 324 146
changes 0 324 146
you 0 324 146
into 0 324 146
a 0 324 146
different 0 324 146
kind 0 324 146
of 0 324 146
being, 0 324 146
one 0 324 146
that 0 324 146
is 0 324 146
by 0 324 146
nature 0 324 146
an 0 324 146
opponent 0 324 146
of 0 324 146
Truth, 0 324 146
ordered 0 324 146
against 0 324 146
Truth. 0 324 146

This 0 324 147
of 0 324 147
course 0 324 147
means 0 324 147
that 0 324 147
a 0 324 147
person 0 324 147
whose 0 324 147
“orientation,” 0 324 147
as 0 324 147
we 0 324 147
might 0 324 147
say, 0 324 147
is 0 324 147
towards 0 324 147
falsehood, 0 324 147
even 0 324 147
when 0 324 147
he 0 324 147
is 0 324 147
at 0 324 147
any 0 324 147
given 0 324 147
moment 0 324 147
saying 0 324 147
something 0 324 147
true, 0 324 147
is 0 324 147
still 0 324 147
servicing 0 324 147
his 0 324 147
lies. 0 324 147

He 0 324 148
tells 0 324 148
the 0 324 148
truth 0 324 148
only 0 324 148
to 0 324 148
continue 0 324 148
to 0 324 148
control 0 324 148
and 0 324 148
manipulate 0 324 148
reality. 0 324 148

It 0 324 149
was 0 324 149
not 0 324 149
by 0 324 149
violence, 0 324 149
but 0 324 149
by 0 324 149
lying 0 324 149
and 0 324 149
manipulation, 0 324 149
by 0 324 149
issuing 0 324 149
half-truths 0 324 149
and 0 324 149
pretending 0 324 149
to 0 324 149
be 0 324 149
the 0 324 149
kind 0 324 149
of 0 324 149
man 0 324 149
he 0 324 149
was 0 324 149
not, 0 324 149
that 0 324 149
Shakespeare’s 0 324 149
character 0 324 149
Iago 0 324 149
earned 0 324 149
the 0 324 149
title 0 324 149
of 0 324 149
most 0 324 149
evil 0 324 149
character 0 324 149
in 0 324 149
English 0 324 149
literature. 0 324 149

Human 0 324 150
beings 0 324 150
are 0 324 150
naturally 0 324 150
ordered 0 324 150
towards 0 324 150
the 0 324 150
truth, 0 324 150
and 0 324 150
we 0 324 150
have 0 324 150
to 0 324 150
work 0 324 150
at 0 324 150
assuming 0 324 150
a 0 324 150
lie. 0 324 150

This 0 324 151
is 0 324 151
why 0 324 151
confidence 0 324 151
tricksters 0 324 151
can 0 324 151
be 0 324 151
successful, 0 324 151
why 0 324 151
lying 0 324 151
works 0 324 151
for 0 324 151
getting 0 324 151
what 0 324 151
you 0 324 151
want; 0 324 151
people 0 324 151
don’t 0 324 151
see 0 324 151
it 0 324 151
coming. 0 324 151

The 0 324 152
first 0 324 152
natural 0 324 152
assumption 0 324 152
is 0 324 152
trust, 0 324 152
at 0 324 152
least 0 324 152
at 0 324 152
the 0 324 152
basic 0 324 152
level 0 324 152
of 0 324 152
expecting 0 324 152
truth 0 324 152
most 0 324 152
of 0 324 152
the 0 324 152
time. 0 324 152

We 0 324 153
therefore 0 324 153
instinctively 0 324 153
see 0 324 153
lying 0 324 153
as 0 324 153
a 0 324 153
betrayal 0 324 153
of 0 324 153
trust. 0 324 153

Considering 0 324 154
how 0 324 154
much 0 324 154
trust 0 324 154
the 0 324 154
Catholic 0 324 154
faithful 0 324 154
had 0 324 154
in 0 324 154
the 0 324 154
papacy 0 324 154
until 0 324 154
about 0 324 154
1965, 0 324 154
how 0 324 154
much 0 324 154
un-earned 0 324 154
trust 0 324 154
Francis 0 324 154
started 0 324 154
with 0 324 154
just 0 324 154
by 0 324 154
being 0 324 154
elected, 0 324 154
this 0 324 154
pontificate 0 324 154
should 0 324 154
be 0 324 154
remembered 0 324 154
as 0 324 154
one 1 324 154
of 1 324 154
the 1 324 154
great 1 324 154
confidence 1 324 154
scams 1 324 154
in 0 324 154
history. 0 324 154

Believing 0 324 155
Catholics 0 324 155
have 0 324 155
watched 1 324 155
aghast 1 324 155
as 0 324 155
this 0 324 155
pope 0 324 155
has 0 324 155
habitually 0 324 155
trampled 0 324 155
on 0 324 155
every 0 324 155
aspect 0 324 155
of 0 324 155
Catholic 0 324 155
teaching. 0 324 155

Sandro 0 324 156
Magister 0 324 156
recently 0 324 156
published 0 324 156
a 0 324 156
piece 0 324 156
on 0 324 156
his 0 324 156
website 0 324 156
that 0 324 156
listed 0 324 156
in 0 324 156
dizzying 1 324 156
detail 1 324 156
the 0 324 156
many 0 324 156
times, 0 324 156
in 0 324 156
only 0 324 156
the 0 324 156
last 0 324 156
few 0 324 156
months, 0 324 156
that 0 324 156
pope 0 324 156
Francis 0 324 156
has 0 324 156
falsified 0 324 156
with 0 324 156
obvious 0 324 156
intention, 0 324 156
the 0 324 156
words 0 324 156
of 0 324 156
Christ 0 324 156
in 0 324 156
Scripture 0 324 156
and 0 324 156
the 0 324 156
teaching 0 324 156
of 0 324 156
the 0 324 156
Church. 0 324 156

Of 0 324 157
course 0 324 157
this 0 324 157
would 0 324 157
be 0 324 157
of 0 324 157
little 0 324 157
interest 0 324 157
to 0 324 157
secular 1 324 157
journalists, 1 324 157
who 0 324 157
have 0 324 157
paid 0 324 157
no 0 324 157
mind 0 324 157
to 0 324 157
his 0 324 157
habit 0 324 157
of 0 324 157
rewriting 0 324 157
Catholicism, 0 324 157
but 0 324 157
the 0 324 157
sex 0 324 157
abuse 0 324 157
crisis 0 324 157
is 0 324 157
something 0 324 157
secular 1 324 157
journalists 1 324 157
are 0 324 157
very 0 324 157
interested 0 324 157
in, 0 324 157
a 0 324 157
fact 0 324 157
Bergoglio 0 324 157
seems 0 324 157
not 0 324 157
to 0 324 157
have 0 324 157
understood. 0 324 157

It 0 324 158
is 0 324 158
now 0 324 158
irrefutable 0 324 158
that 0 324 158
Pope 0 324 158
Bergoglio 0 324 158
is 0 324 158
a 0 324 158
habitual 1 324 158
liar 1 324 158
– 0 324 158
that 0 324 158
in 0 324 158
fact 0 324 158
truth, 0 324 158
like 0 324 158
reality, 0 324 158
seems 0 324 158
to 0 324 158
mean 0 324 158
nothing 0 324 158
to 0 324 158
him 0 324 158
except 0 324 158
as 0 324 158
a 0 324 158
tool. 0 324 158

Sociologists 0 324 159
talk 0 324 159
about 0 324 159
the 0 324 159
concept 0 324 159
of 0 324 159
the 0 324 159
“high 0 324 159
trust 0 324 159
society,” 0 324 159
one 0 324 159
in 0 324 159
which 0 324 159
citizens 0 324 159
believe 0 324 159
what 0 324 159
they 0 324 159
are 0 324 159
told 0 324 159
by 0 324 159
the 0 324 159
elites 0 324 159
and 0 324 159
trust 0 324 159
them 0 324 159
to 0 324 159
govern 0 324 159
and 0 324 159
protect 0 324 159
them 0 324 159
adequately. 0 324 159

They 1 324 160
warn 1 324 160
that 1 324 160
the 1 324 160
general 1 324 160
loss 1 324 160
of 1 324 160
trust 1 324 160
in 1 324 160
institutions 1 324 160
leads 1 324 160
to 1 324 160
a 1 324 160
general 1 324 160
state 1 324 160
of 1 324 160
chaos, 1 324 160
in 1 324 160
which 1 324 160
laws 1 324 160
on 1 324 160
the 1 324 160
books 1 324 160
matter 1 324 160
little 1 324 160
as 1 324 160
citizens 1 324 160
turn 1 324 160
to 1 324 160
their 1 324 160
last 1 324 160
resort 1 324 160
of 1 324 160
protecting 1 324 160
themselves 1 324 160
and 1 324 160
their 1 324 160
own 1 324 160
families. 1 324 160

This 0 324 161
is 0 324 161
the 0 324 161
way 0 324 161
societies 0 324 161
disintegrate. 0 324 161

It 0 324 162
has 0 324 162
been 0 324 162
said 0 324 162
many 0 324 162
times 0 324 162
that 0 324 162
the 0 324 162
sex 0 324 162
abuse 0 324 162
crisis 0 324 162
has 0 324 162
created 0 324 162
a 0 324 162
massive 0 324 162
loss 0 324 162
of 0 324 162
trust 0 324 162
in 0 324 162
prelates 0 324 162
among 0 324 162
the 0 324 162
Catholic 0 324 162
faithful, 0 324 162
and 0 324 162
this 0 324 162
is 0 324 162
true. 0 324 162

With 0 324 163
a 0 324 163
professional 1 324 163
confidence 1 324 163
trickster 1 324 163
on 0 324 163
the 0 324 163
papal 0 324 163
throne, 0 324 163
blatantly 1 324 163
using 1 324 163
lies 1 324 163
and 1 324 163
manipulation 1 324 163
to 0 324 163
maintain 0 324 163
power 0 324 163
and 0 324 163
ram 0 324 163
through 0 324 163
an 0 324 163
agenda 0 324 163
at 0 324 163
radical 0 324 163
variance 0 324 163
with 0 324 163
Catholic 0 324 163
doctrine, 0 324 163
how 0 324 163
long 0 324 163
before 0 324 163
that 0 324 163
predictable 0 324 163
disintegration 0 324 163
occurs? 0 324 163

Are 0 324 164
we 0 324 164
seeing 0 324 164
it 0 324 164
already? 0 324 164

Are 0 324 165
we 0 324 165
seeing 0 324 165
it 0 324 165
in 0 324 165
the 0 324 165
declarations 0 324 165
of 0 324 165
this 0 324 165
or 0 324 165
that 0 324 165
episcopate 0 324 165
on 0 324 165
Amoris 0 324 165
Laetitia 0 324 165
and 0 324 165
Communion 0 324 165
for 0 324 165
divorced 0 324 165
and 0 324 165
civilly 0 324 165
remarried 0 324 165
Catholics? 0 324 165

With 0 324 166
Cardinal 0 324 166
Marx 0 324 166
and 0 324 166
others 0 324 166
promoting 0 324 166
“blessings” 0 324 166
for 0 324 166
“same-sex 0 324 166
unions” 0 324 166
are 0 324 166
we 0 324 166
going 0 324 166
to 0 324 166
be 0 324 166
seeing 0 324 166
an 0 324 166
escalation 0 324 166
of 0 324 166
it? 0 324 166

I 0 324 167
have 0 324 167
seen 0 324 167
a 0 324 167
veritable 0 324 167
chorus 0 324 167
of 0 324 167
Catholics 0 324 167
on 0 324 167
social 0 324 167
media 0 324 167
declaring 0 324 167
that 0 324 167
if 1 324 167
Paul 1 324 167
VI 1 324 167
is 1 324 167
canonised, 1 324 167
their 1 324 167
loss 1 324 167
of 1 324 167
faith 1 324 167
in 1 324 167
the 1 324 167
Church 1 324 167
as 1 324 167
an 1 324 167
institution 1 324 167
will 1 324 167
be 1 324 167
complete. 1 324 167

I 0 324 168
am 0 324 168
told 0 324 168
from 0 324 168
contacts 0 324 168
inside 0 324 168
the 0 324 168
Vatican 0 324 168
that 0 324 168
after 0 324 168
the 0 324 168
trip 0 324 168
to 0 324 168
Chile 0 324 168
Bergoglio’s 0 324 168
support 0 324 168
has 0 324 168
completely 0 324 168
dried 0 324 168
up. 0 324 168

He 0 324 169
has 0 324 169
no 0 324 169
more 0 324 169
resources 0 324 169
of 0 324 169
trust 0 324 169
even 0 324 169
among 0 324 169
the 0 324 169
people 0 324 169
he 0 324 169
has 0 324 169
chosen 0 324 169
to 0 324 169
surround 0 324 169
himself 0 324 169
with 0 324 169
and 0 324 169
after 0 324 169
the 0 324 169
reports 0 324 169
of 0 324 169
Cardinal 0 324 169
Sandri 0 324 169
going 0 324 169
toe-to-toe 0 324 169
with 0 324 169
him 0 324 169
in 0 324 169
a 0 324 169
shouting 1 324 169
match, 1 324 169
it 0 324 169
seems 0 324 169
that 0 324 169
perhaps 0 324 169
even 0 324 169
his 0 324 169
legendary 0 324 169
vicious 1 324 169
temper 1 324 169
tantrums 1 324 169
are 0 324 169
failing 0 324 169
to 0 324 169
have 0 324 169
the 0 324 169
desired 0 324 169
effect 0 324 169
of 0 324 169
terrorising 1 324 169
his 1 324 169
subordinates 1 324 169
into 1 324 169
submission. 1 324 169

Marie 0 324 170
Collins, 0 324 170
by 0 324 170
no 0 324 170
stretch 0 324 170
even 0 324 170
a 0 324 170
“conservative” 0 324 170
Catholic, 0 324 170
echoed 0 324 170
this 0 324 170
concern, 0 324 170
saying 0 324 170
the 0 324 170
Barros 0 324 170
affair 0 324 170
has 0 324 170
“definitely 0 324 170
undermined 0 324 170
credibility, 0 324 170
trust, 0 324 170

hope” 0 324 170
in 0 324 170
Francis. 0 324 170

“All 0 324 171
I 0 324 171
can 0 324 171
say 0 324 171
is 0 324 171
that 0 324 171
people 0 324 171
who 0 324 171
had 0 324 171
a 0 324 171

in 0 324 171
this 0 324 171
particular 0 324 171
pope, 0 324 171
and 0 324 171
I 0 324 171
am 0 324 171

in 0 324 171
my 0 324 171
own 0 324 171
parish, 0 324 171
would 0 324 171
find 0 324 171
it 0 324 171
very 0 324 171
difficult 0 324 171
now…and 0 324 171
cannot 0 324 171
understand 0 324 171
and 0 324 171
cannot 0 324 171
believe 0 324 171
that 0 324 171
this 0 324 171
particular 0 324 171
pope 0 324 171
has 0 324 171
said 0 324 171

It 0 324 172
may 0 324 172
seem 0 324 172
like 0 324 172
a 0 324 172
moment 0 324 172
to 0 324 172
enjoy, 0 324 172
seeing 0 324 172
the 0 324 172
apparently 1 324 172
unbreachable 1 324 172

papal 1 324 172

finally 0 324 172
cracking, 0 324 172
but 0 324 172
in 0 324 172
reality 0 324 172
this 0 324 172
situation 0 324 172
is 0 324 172
potentially 0 324 172
very 0 324 172
harmful 0 324 172
for 0 324 172
souls 0 324 172
in 0 324 172
the 0 324 172

There 0 324 173
is 0 324 173
a 0 324 173

of 0 324 173
problems 0 324 173
this 0 324 173

created 0 324 173
or 0 324 173
made 0 324 173
worse 0 324 173
that 0 324 173
we 0 324 173
will 0 324 173
be 0 324 173

book 0 324 179
“The 0 324 179

even 0 324 179
high-ranking 0 324 179

the 0 324 179

It 0 324 180
is 0 324 180
certainly 0 324 180
clear 0 324 180
that 0 324 180

common 0 324 181
in 0 324 181
Italian 0 324 181
journalism 0 324 181
that 0 324 181

somewhat 0 324 181
different 0 324 181

Italians 0 324 182
care 0 324 182
about 0 324 182
getting 0 324 182
a 0 324 182
general 0 324 182
picture 0 324 182
of 0 324 182
what’s 0 324 182
going 0 324 182
on, 0 324 182
where 0 324 182
Anglo-Saxons 0 324 182
are 0 324 182
considered 0 324 182
weirdly 0 324 182

Though 0 324 183
she 0 324 183
never 0 324 183

the 0 324 183
pope, 0 324 183
Marie 0 324 183
Collins 0 324 183

that 0 324 183

the 0 340 6

those 0 340 6
in 0 340 6

that 0 340 6

audience 0 340 23
in 0 340 23
the 0 340 23

which 0 340 23
has 0 340 23
been 0 340 23
moving 0 340 23
in 0 340 23

Ah, 0 340 24
yes, 0 340 24
John 0 340 24
Bolton. 0 340 24

While 0 340 25
I 0 340 25
applaud 0 340 25
Bolton 0 340 25
for 0 340 25
his 0 340 25
willingness 0 340 25
to 0 340 25
call 0 340 25
Islamic 0 340 25
jihadis 0 340 25
just 0 340 25
that, 0 340 25
I 0 340 25
am 0 340 25
not 0 340 25
so 0 340 25
naive 0 340 25
as 0 340 25
to 0 340 25
consider 0 340 25
that 0 340 25
his 0 340 25
membership 0 340 25
in 0 340 25
the 0 340 25
Council 0 340 25
on 0 340 25
Foreign 0 340 25

has 0 340 25
no 0 340 25
effect 0 340 25
in 0 340 25
this 0 340 25
decision. 0 340 25

"The 0 340 26
ordinary 0 340 26
people 0 340 26
of 0 340 26
Iran 0 340 26
are 0 340 26
suffering 0 340 26
under 0 340 26
economic 0 340 26
stagnation, 0 340 26
while 0 340 26
the 0 340 26

its 0 340 26
wealth 0 340 26

and 0 340 26
to 0 340 26
pad 0 340 26
the 0 340 26
bank 0 340 26
accounts 0 340 26
of 0 340 26
the 0 340 26
Mullahs 0 340 26
and 0 340 26
the 0 340 26
IRGC 0 340 26
command," 0 340 26
SSG 0 340 26
writes 0 340 26
in 0 340 26
the 0 340 26
paper. 0 340 26

"This 0 340 27
has 0 340 27
provoked 0 340 27
noteworthy 0 340 27
protests 0 340 27
across 0 340 27
the 0 340 27
country 0 340 27
in 0 340 27
recent 0 340 27
months." 0 340 27

Well, 0 340 28
why 0 340 28
is 0 340 28
that? 0 340 28

It's 0 340 29
due 0 340 29
to 0 340 29
sanctions 0 340 29
imposed 0 340 29
by 0 340 29
the 0 340 29
likes 0 340 29
of 0 340 29
the 0 340 29
US. 0 340 29

As 0 340 30
has 0 340 30
been 0 340 30
pointed 0 340 30
out 0 340 30
before, 0 340 30
sanctions 0 340 30
hurt 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
people, 0 340 30
not 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
governments 0 340 30
that 0 340 30
lead 0 340 30
them 0 340 30
and 0 340 30
then 0 340 30
those 0 340 30
same 0 340 30
governments 0 340 30
use 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
effects 0 340 30
to 0 340 30
propagandize 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
people 0 340 30
against 0 340 30
those 0 340 30
who 0 340 30
are 0 340 30
ordering 0 340 30
the 0 340 30
sanctions. 0 340 30

I'm 0 340 31
not 0 340 31
saying 0 340 31
the 0 340 31
Iranian 0 340 31
government 0 340 31
is 0 340 31
good, 0 340 31
but 0 340 31
it 0 340 31
is 0 340 31
Iran's 0 340 31
government. 0 340 31

Honestly, 0 340 32
I 0 340 32
see 0 340 32
a 0 340 32
ton 0 340 32
of 0 340 32
corruption 0 340 32
and 0 340 32
warmongering 0 340 32
in 0 340 32
our 0 340 32
own 0 340 32
government 0 340 32
that 0 340 32
rivals 0 340 32
some 0 340 32
of 0 340 32
that 0 340 32
of 0 340 32
governments 0 340 32
that 0 340 32
America 0 340 32
stands 0 340 32
against. 0 340 32

Still, 0 340 33
as 0 340 33
was 0 340 33
pointed 0 340 33
out 0 340 33
by 0 340 33
Matt 0 340 33
Agorist, 0 340 33
Bolton 0 340 33
told 0 340 33
an 0 340 33
audience 0 340 33
of 0 340 33
the 0 340 33
Grand 0 340 33
Gathering 0 340 33
of 0 340 33
Iranians 0 340 33
for 0 340 33
Free 0 340 33
Iran: 0 340 33

“There 0 340 34
is 0 340 34
a 0 340 34
viable 0 340 34
opposition 0 340 34
to 0 340 34
the 0 340 34
rule 0 340 34
of 0 340 34
the 0 340 34
ayatollahs, 0 340 34
and 0 340 34
that 0 340 34
opposition 0 340 34
is 0 340 34
centered 0 340 34
in 0 340 34
this 0 340 34
room 0 340 34
today. 0 340 34

I 0 340 35
had 0 340 35
said 0 340 35
for 0 340 35
over 0 340 35
10 0 340 35
years 0 340 35
since 0 340 35
coming 0 340 35
to 0 340 35
these 0 340 35
events, 0 340 35
that 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
declared 0 340 35
policy 0 340 35
of 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
United 0 340 35
States 0 340 35
of 0 340 35
America 0 340 35
should 0 340 35
be 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
overthrow 0 340 35
of 0 340 35
the 0 340 35
mullahs’ 0 340 35
regime 0 340 35
in 0 340 35
Tehran. 0 340 35

The 0 340 36
behavior 0 340 36
and 0 340 36
the 0 340 36
objectives 0 340 36
of 0 340 36
the 0 340 36
regime 0 340 36
are 0 340 36
not 0 340 36
going 0 340 36
to 0 340 36
change, 0 340 36
and 0 340 36
therefore 0 340 36
the 1 340 36
only 1 340 36
solution 1 340 36
is 0 340 36
to 0 340 36
change 0 340 36
the 0 340 36
regime 0 340 36
itself. 0 340 36

And 0 340 37
that’s 0 340 37
why, 0 340 37
before 0 340 37
2019, 0 340 37
we 0 340 37
here 0 340 37
will 0 340 37
celebrate 0 340 37
in 0 340 37
Tehran!” 0 340 37

And 0 340 38
again, 0 340 38
this 0 340 38
really 0 340 38
has 0 340 38
nothing 0 340 38
to 0 340 38
do 0 340 38
with 0 340 38
the 0 340 38
US. 0 340 38

One 0 340 39

close 0 340 39
to 0 340 39
the 0 340 39

who 0 340 39
has 0 340 39
previewed 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
plan 0 340 39
told 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
Free 0 340 39

that 0 340 39
the 0 340 39

also 0 340 39
known 0 340 39
as 0 340 39

solidified 0 340 39
the 0 340 39
Iranian 0 340 39

grip 0 340 39
on 0 340 39

and 0 340 39
intentionally 0 340 39
prevented 0 340 39

from 0 340 39
fomenting 0 340 39

“The 0 340 40

said 0 340 40
the 0 340 40

who 0 340 40

background 0 340 40
about 0 340 40
the 0 340 40
sensitive 0 340 40
issue. 0 340 40

“Prior 0 340 41
to 0 340 41
that, 0 340 41
everyone 0 340 41
understood 0 340 41
the 0 340 41

It’s 0 340 42
now 0 340 42
Trump, 0 340 42
Bolton, 0 340 42
and 0 340 42
[Mike] 0 340 42
Pompeo’s 0 340 42
job 0 340 42
to 0 340 42
put 0 340 42
this 0 340 42
consensus 0 340 42
back 0 340 42
in 0 340 42
place.” 0 340 42

The 0 340 43
source 0 340 43
told 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
Beacon 0 340 43
that 0 340 43
Bolton 0 340 43
is 0 340 43
“acutely 0 340 43
aware 0 340 43
of 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
danger 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
Iranian 0 340 43
regime 0 340 43
poses 0 340 43
to 0 340 43
the 0 340 43
region.” 0 340 43

“John 0 340 44
is 0 340 44
someone 0 340 44
who 0 340 44
understands 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
danger 0 340 44
of 0 340 44
Iran 0 340 44
viscerally, 0 340 44
and 0 340 44
knows 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
you’re 0 340 44
never 0 340 44
going 0 340 44
to 0 340 44
fundamentally 0 340 44
change 0 340 44
its 0 340 44
behavior—and 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
threats 0 340 44
against 0 340 44
Israel 0 340 44
and 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
Saudis 0 340 44
especially—until 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
revolutionary 0 340 44
regime 0 340 44
is 0 340 44
gone,” 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
source 0 340 44
said, 0 340 44
adding 0 340 44
that 0 340 44
“nothing’s 0 340 44
off 0 340 44
the 0 340 44
table 0 340 44
right 0 340 44
now 0 340 44
if 0 340 44
Israel 0 340 44
is 0 340 44
attacked.” 0 340 44

OK, 0 340 45
I 0 340 45
get 0 340 45
they 0 340 45
may 0 340 45
pose 0 340 45
a 0 340 45
danger, 0 340 45
but 0 340 45
let's 0 340 45
look 0 340 45
at 0 340 45
the 0 340 45
reality 0 340 45
here. 0 340 45

Those 0 340 46
they 0 340 46
pose 0 340 46
a 0 340 46
danger 0 340 46
to, 0 340 46
namely 0 340 46
Saudi 0 340 46
Arabia 0 340 46
and 0 340 46
Israel 0 340 46
can 0 340 46
both 0 340 46
fend 0 340 46
perfectly 0 340 46
well 0 340 46
for 0 340 46
themselves 0 340 46
and 0 340 46
have 0 340 46
demonstrated 0 340 46
that 0 340 46
ability 0 340 46
to 0 340 46
do 0 340 46
it. 0 340 46

There 0 340 47
is 0 340 47
no 0 340 47
need 0 340 47
for 0 340 47
the 0 340 47
US 0 340 47
to 0 340 47
be 0 340 47
involved 0 340 47
in 0 340 47
it 0 340 47
in 0 340 47
any 0 340 47
way. 0 340 47

Why 0 340 48
should 0 340 48
we 0 340 48
be 0 340 48
fighting 0 340 48
a 0 340 48
battle 0 340 48
or 0 340 48
encouraging, 0 340 48
funding, 0 340 48
and 0 340 48
I'm 0 340 48
quite 0 340 48
sure 0 340 48
arming, 0 340 48
a 0 340 48
rebellion? 0 340 48

Where 0 340 49
is 0 340 49
that 0 340 49
authorized 0 340 49
in 0 340 49
our 1 340 49
Constitution? 1 340 49

Simple. 0 340 50

It 0 340 51
isn't. 0 340 51

I 0 340 52
care 0 340 52
little 0 340 52
for 0 340 52
the 0 340 52
Saudi 0 340 52
government 0 340 52
as 0 340 52
they 0 340 52
help 0 340 52
push 0 340 52
Sharia 0 340 52
and 0 340 52
is 0 340 52
the 0 340 52
land 0 340 52
where 0 340 52
many 0 340 52
of 0 340 52
the 0 340 52
9-11 0 340 52
hijackers 0 340 52
came 0 340 52
from. 0 340 52

The 0 340 53
Iranian 0 340 53
government 0 340 53
I 0 340 53
care 0 340 53
for 0 340 53
even 0 340 53
less, 0 340 53
but 0 340 53
out 0 340 53
of 0 340 53
each 0 340 53
of 0 340 53
those, 0 340 53
which 0 340 53
one 0 340 53
should 0 340 53
America 0 340 53
have 0 340 53
dealt 0 340 53
with 0 340 53
militarily 0 340 53
following 0 340 53
9-11? 0 340 53

Both, 0 340 54
if 0 340 54
you're 0 340 54
going 0 340 54
to 0 340 54
go 0 340 54
by 0 340 54
information 0 340 54
that 0 340 54
we 0 340 54
have 0 340 54
a 0 340 54
record 0 340 54
on. 0 340 54

Why 0 340 55
can't 0 340 55
America 0 340 55
focus 0 340 55
on 0 340 55
it's 0 340 55
own 0 340 55
issues 0 340 55
and 0 340 55
solve 0 340 55
those? 0 340 55

It's 0 340 56
because 0 340 56
we 0 340 56
are 0 340 56
too 0 340 56
busy 0 340 56
trying 0 340 56
to 0 340 56
police 0 340 56
the 0 340 56
world, 0 340 56
keeping 0 340 56
the 0 340 56
spotlight 0 340 56
off 0 340 56
of 0 340 56
those 0 340 56
in 0 340 56
our 0 340 56
government 0 340 56
who 0 340 56
are 0 340 56
attacking 0 340 56
our 0 340 56
rights 0 340 56
and 0 340 56
spending 0 340 56
us 0 340 56
into 0 340 56
more 0 340 56
and 0 340 56
more 0 340 56
debt. 0 340 56

And 0 340 57
lest 0 340 57
you 0 340 57
think 0 340 57
this 0 340 57
is 0 340 57
about 0 340 57
the 0 340 57
nuclear 0 340 57
deal. 0 340 57

It 0 340 58
isn't. 0 340 58

“The 0 340 59

is 0 340 59
not 0 340 59
the 0 340 59

I 1 340 64
don't 1 340 64

it. 1 340 64

This 0 340 65
will 0 340 65
probably 0 340 65
end 0 340 65
up 0 340 65

that 0 340 73

“We 0 340 75
must 0 340 75

it's 0 340 80
not 0 340 80
part 0 340 80

“So, 0 350 1
we 0 350 1

them 0 350 1

And 0 350 2
we 0 350 2
have 0 350 2
to 0 350 2
start 0 350 2
doing 0 350 2
something 0 350 2
about 0 350 2
them. 0 350 2

There 0 350 3

There 0 350 4

what 0 350 6
do 0 350 6

at 0 350 7

Interestingly 0 350 9
enough, 0 350 9
it 0 350 9
looks 0 350 9

the 0 350 9

Just 0 355 22
this 0 355 22
week, 0 355 22
we 0 355 22
reported 0 355 22
that 0 355 22
Hungary 0 355 22
had 0 355 22
grown 0 355 22
weary 0 355 22
of 0 355 22
the 0 355 22

of 0 355 22
pushing 0 355 22
illegal 0 355 22

on 0 355 22
their 0 355 22
country 0 355 22
and 0 355 22
Europe, 0 355 22
and 0 355 22
was 0 355 22
preparing 0 355 22
to 0 355 22
walk 0 355 22
away 0 355 22
from 0 355 22
the 0 355 22

Orban 0 355 23
has 0 355 23
taken 0 355 23
a 0 355 23
tough 0 355 23
stance 0 355 23
in 0 355 23
Hungary. 0 355 23

He 0 355 24
has 0 355 24
ordered 1 355 24
all 1 355 24
illegal 1 355 24
Muslim 1 355 24
invaders 1 355 24
to 1 355 24

out 1 355 24

Hungary 1 355 24
and 1 355 24
never 1 355 24
come 1 355 24
back. 1 355 24

In 0 355 25
December, 0 355 25
he 0 355 25
said 0 355 25
that 0 355 25
he 0 355 25
was 0 355 25
not 0 355 25
concerned 0 355 25
with 0 355 25
what 0 355 25
Brussels 0 355 25
wanted, 0 355 25

was 0 355 25
determined 0 355 25
to 0 355 25
defend 0 355 25
Hungary's 0 355 25
borders. 0 355 25

PM 0 355 26
Orban 0 355 26
has 0 355 26
done 0 355 26
just 0 355 26
that, 0 355 26
too. 0 355 26

Orban's 0 355 27
border 0 355 27
wall 0 355 27
virtually 0 355 27

Orban 0 355 28
is 0 355 28
openly 1 355 28
Christian 1 355 28
and 0 355 28
seems 0 355 28
to 0 355 28

something 0 355 28
that 0 355 28
many 0 355 28
do 0 355 28
not 0 355 28
and 0 355 28
that 0 355 28
is 0 355 28
you 0 355 28
do 0 355 28
not 0 355 28
allow 0 355 28
a 0 355 28
wholesale 0 355 28
flood 1 355 28
of 1 355 28

all 1 355 31
you 1 355 31
are 1 355 31
asking 1 355 31
for 1 355 31
is 1 355 31
the 1 355 31

warned 1 355 31

on 0 381 13
some 0 381 13
details. 0 381 13

I 0 381 14
realize 0 381 14
that 0 381 14
in 0 381 14
the 0 381 14
heat 0 381 14
of 0 381 14
a 0 381 14
shooting, 0 381 14
particularly 0 381 14
a 0 381 14
mass 0 381 14
shooting, 0 381 14
it 0 381 14
may 0 381 14
take 0 381 14
some 0 381 14
time 0 381 14
for 0 381 14
a 0 381 14
precise 0 381 14

But 0 381 15
it 0 381 15
didn’t 0 381 15
take 0 381 15
very 0 381 15
long 0 381 15
for 0 381 15
the 0 381 15

The 0 381 16
initial 0 381 16

was 0 381 16
that 0 381 16
Stephen 0 381 16
Paddock’s 0 381 16

stopped 0 381 16

approximately 0 381 16
6 0 381 16
minutes 0 381 16
after 0 381 16
he 0 381 16

turned 0 381 17
his 0 381 17
fire 0 381 17
into 0 381 17
the 0 381 17

firing 0 381 17
some 0 381 17

and 0 381 17
after 0 381 17
that 0 381 17

that 0 381 27

six 0 381 27

The 0 381 28
confusion 0 381 28
began 0 381 28
Monday 0 381 28
when 0 381 28

said 0 381 28
that 0 381 28

they 0 381 28

back 0 381 30
on 0 381 30
this 0 381 30

that 0 381 30
there 0 381 30
were 0 381 30
unspecified 0 381 30

on 0 381 30
Thursday, 0 381 30
releasing 0 381 30
a 0 381 30

Lombardo 0 381 31
had 0 381 31
said 0 381 31
Monday 0 381 31
that 0 381 31
Campos, 0 381 31
the 0 381 31
guard, 0 381 31
was 0 381 31
shot 0 381 31
at 0 381 31
9:59 0 381 31
p.m. 0 381 31

that 0 381 31

six-minute 0 381 32
gap 0 381 32
relayed 0 381 32
by 0 381 32
Lombardo 0 381 32
left 0 381 32
uncertain 0 381 32
whether 0 381 32
there 0 381 32
was 0 381 32
any 0 381 32
lag 0 381 32
in 0 381 32
alerting 0 381 32

of 0 381 32
the 0 381 32
gunfire 0 381 32
during 0 381 32
critical 0 381 32
moments. 0 381 32

Police 0 381 33
said 0 381 33
officers 0 381 33
arrived 0 381 33
on 0 381 33
the 0 381 33
32nd 0 381 33

at 0 381 33
10:17 0 381 33
p.m., 0 381 33
two 0 381 33
minutes 0 381 33
after 0 381 33
Paddock 0 381 33
had 0 381 33
stopped 0 381 33
firing. 0 381 33

MGM, 0 381 34
though, 0 381 34
said 0 381 34
it 0 381 34
was 0 381 34
“confident” 0 381 34
that 0 381 34
the 0 381 34
9:59 0 381 34
p.m. 0 381 34
time 0 381 34
was 0 381 34
inaccurate 0 381 34
and 0 381 34
“was 0 381 34

we 0 381 34
now 0 381 34
have.” 0 381 34
The 0 381 34
company 0 381 34
also 0 381 34
disputed 0 381 34
the 0 381 34
suggestion 0 381 34
of 0 381 34
a 0 381 34
lag, 0 381 34
saying 0 381 34
the 0 381 34
shooting 0 381 34
rampage 0 381 34
began 0 381 34
within 0 381 34
a 0 381 34
minute 0 381 34
of 0 381 34
Campos 0 381 34
reporting 0 381 34

on 0 381 34

On 0 381 35
Friday, 0 381 35
Lombardo 0 381 35
effectively 0 381 35
agreed 0 381 35
with 0 381 35
the 0 381 35
company’s 0 381 35
statement, 0 381 35
though 0 381 35
he 0 381 35
argued 0 381 35
that 0 381 35
the 0 381 35
9:59 0 381 35
p.m. 0 381 35
time 0 381 35
he 0 381 35
had 0 381 35
offered 0 381 35
four 0 381 35
days 0 381 35
earlier 0 381 35
“wasn’t 0 381 35
inaccurate 0 381 35
when 0 381 35
I 0 381 35
provided 0 381 35
it.” 0 381 35
Lombardo 0 381 35
said 0 381 35
he 0 381 35
was 0 381 35
told 0 381 35
this 0 381 35
time 0 381 35
had 0 381 35

Upon 0 381 36
investigation, 0 381 36
Lombardo 0 381 36
said, 0 381 36
police 0 381 36
learned 0 381 36
that 0 381 36
Campos 0 381 36
first 0 381 36
encountered 0 381 36
a 0 381 36
barricaded 0 381 36

9:59 0 381 36
p.m. 0 381 36

The 0 381 37
guard 0 381 37
was 0 381 37
eventually 0 381 37
fired 0 381 37
upon 0 381 37
by 0 381 37
Paddock 0 381 37
“in 0 381 37

Clear, 0 381 38
right? 0 381 38

Not 0 381 39
so 0 381 39
fast, 0 381 39
the 0 381 39
police 0 381 39
and 0 381 39

arrive 0 381 39
on 0 381 39
the 0 381 39

Stephen 0 381 39

firing 0 381 39
his 0 381 39
deadly 0 381 39
fusillade 0 381 39

Las 0 381 40

say 0 381 40
they 0 381 40
didn’t 0 381 40
get 0 381 40
to 0 381 40
the 0 381 40
floor 0 381 40
until 0 381 40
after 0 381 40
the 0 381 40

over. 0 381 40

police 0 381 41

were 0 381 41
there 0 381 41
shortly 0 381 41
after 0 381 41
the 0 381 41

The 0 381 42
discrepancy 0 381 42
could 0 381 42
raise 0 381 42
questions 0 381 42
about 0 381 42
whether 0 381 42

steps 0 381 42
to 0 381 42

while 0 381 42
Paddock 0 381 42

and 0 381 43
“immediately 0 381 43

that 0 381 43
“Metro 0 381 43

The 0 381 44
statement 0 381 44
says 0 381 44
MGM 0 381 44
believes 0 381 44
Paddock 0 381 44

out 0 381 44
the 0 381 44

down 0 386 2
on 0 386 2
Monday 0 386 2
from 0 386 2

CNN 0 386 3
in 0 386 3
turn 0 386 3
dropped 0 386 3
its 0 386 3
lawsuit 0 386 3
on 0 386 3
the 0 386 3
matter, 0 386 3
which 0 386 3
had 0 386 3
ballooned 1 386 3
into 0 386 3
a 0 386 3

to 0 386 4

touched 0 386 4
off 0 386 4
Mr. 0 386 4
Trump’s 0 386 4
ire 1 386 4
— 0 386 4
the 0 386 4
administration 0 386 4
used 0 386 4
the 0 386 4
occasion 0 386 4
to 0 386 4
lay 0 386 4
down 0 386 4
a 0 386 4
set 0 386 4
of 0 386 4
formal 0 386 4

governing 0 386 4

future 0 386 4
White 0 386 4

a 0 386 4
highly 0 386 4
unusual 0 386 4
step. 0 386 4

Among 0 386 5
the 0 386 5
guidelines 0 386 5
was 0 386 5
a 0 386 5
restriction 0 386 5

“Failure 0 386 6
to 0 386 6

the 0 386 6

warned, 0 386 6
“may 0 386 6
result 0 386 6

The 0 386 7
White 0 386 7

sought 0 386 7
to 0 386 7
blame 0 386 7
Mr. 0 386 7
Acosta 0 386 7
for 0 386 7
behaving 0 386 7
disrespectfully, 0 386 7
although 0 386 7
Mr. 0 386 7
Trump 0 386 7
often 0 386 7
lobs 0 386 7
insults 1 386 7
at 0 386 7
journalists 0 386 7

when 0 386 7
taking 0 386 7
questions 0 386 7

Codifying 0 386 8
the 0 386 8
behavior 0 386 8
of 0 386 8
journalists 0 386 8
struck 0 386 8
some 0 386 8
as 0 386 8
an 0 386 8
ominous 1 386 8
encroachment 1 386 8
into 0 386 8
freedom 0 386 8
of 0 386 8
the 0 386 8
press, 0 386 8

the 0 386 8
White 0 386 8
House 0 386 8
Correspondents’ 0 386 8
Association 0 386 8
said 0 386 8
on 0 386 8
Monday 0 386 8
that 0 386 8
it 0 386 8
had 0 386 8
not 0 386 8
been 0 386 8
consulted 0 386 8
about 0 386 8
the 0 386 8

Liberties 0 386 9
Union, 0 386 9
in 0 386 9
a 0 386 9
statement, 0 386 9
said: 0 386 9
“These 0 386 9
rules 0 386 9
give 0 386 9
the 0 386 9

far 0 386 9
too 0 386 9
much 0 386 9
discretion 0 386 9
to 0 386 9
avoid 0 386 9
real 0 386 9
scrutiny. 0 386 9

The 0 386 10
White 0 386 10
House 0 386 10
belongs 0 386 10
to 0 386 10
the 0 386 10
public, 0 386 10
not 0 386 10
the 0 386 10

the 0 386 10
job 0 386 10
of 0 386 10

is 0 386 10
to 0 386 10

not 0 386 10
to 0 386 10

company.” 0 386 10

Still, 0 386 11
the 0 386 11
guidelines 0 386 11
are 0 386 11
not 0 386 11
far 0 386 11
removed 0 386 11
from 0 386 11
the 0 386 11
manner 0 386 11
in 0 386 11
which 0 386 11
White 0 386 11
House 0 386 11

typically 0 386 11

Mr. 0 386 12
Trump 0 386 12
made 0 386 12
clear 0 386 12
last 0 386 12
week 0 386 12
that 0 386 12
he 0 386 12
would 0 386 12
introduce 0 386 12
“regulations” 0 386 12
after 0 386 12
a 0 386 12
federal 0 386 12
judge 0 386 12
criticized 0 386 12
the 0 386 12
White 0 386 12
House 0 386 12
for 0 386 12
stripping 0 386 12

without 0 386 12
due 0 386 12

or 0 386 12
a 0 386 12
coherent 0 386 12
rationale. 0 386 12

“We 0 386 13
would 0 386 13
have 0 386 13
greatly 0 386 13

set 0 386 13
of 0 386 13
understood 0 386 13
professional 0 386 13

in 0 386 13
a 0 386 13

Press 0 386 14
relations 0 386 14

not 0 386 14
always 0 386 14
rosy 0 386 14
in 0 386 14
pre-Trump 0 386 14

President 0 386 15

Mr. 0 386 16
Obama 0 386 16
often 0 386 16
chastised 0 386 16
reporters, 0 386 16
including 0 386 16
Mr. 0 386 16

on 0 386 16
one 0 386 16
occasion, 0 386 16
for 0 386 16
questions 0 386 16
he 0 386 16
deemed 0 386 16
overly 1 386 16
aggressive 1 386 16

grandstanding. 1 386 16

But 0 386 17
Mr. 0 386 17
Trump, 0 386 17
a 0 386 17

White 0 386 19

was 0 386 19
the 0 386 19
most 0 386 19
severe 1 386 19
step 0 386 19
yet, 0 386 19
and 0 386 19
it 0 386 19
soon 0 386 19
became 0 386 19
apparent 0 386 19
that 0 386 19
the 0 386 19
move 0 386 19
would 0 386 19
not 0 386 19
pass 0 386 19

After 0 386 19
suing 0 386 19
last 0 386 19
week, 0 386 19
Mr. 0 386 19
Acosta 0 386 19
was 0 386 19
granted 0 386 19
the 0 386 19
temporary 0 386 19
return 0 386 19
of 0 386 19
his 0 386 19

A 0 386 20
back-and-forth 0 386 20
ensued 0 386 20
over 0 386 20
the 0 386 20

letter 0 386 21
to 0 386 21
Mr. 0 386 21
Acosta 0 386 21
that 0 386 21
listed 0 386 21
several 0 386 21
reasons 0 386 21
that 0 386 21
his 0 386 21
pass 0 386 21
had 0 386 21
been 0 386 21
revoked, 0 386 21
perhaps 0 386 21
an 0 386 21
attempt 0 386 21
to 0 386 21
satisfy 0 386 21
the 0 386 21
judge’s 0 386 21
request 0 386 21
for 0 386 21
a 0 386 21
clear 0 386 21

that 0 386 25

that 0 386 25
a 0 386 25

did 0 386 25

notion 0 386 26
read 0 386 26

we 0 390 1

a 0 390 1

inherently 0 390 1

We 0 390 2
decided 0 390 2
long 0 390 2
ago 0 390 2
that 0 390 2
the 0 390 2

of 0 390 2

Even 0 390 3
today, 0 390 3

of 0 390 11
“fake 0 390 11

One 0 390 12
thing 0 390 12
we 0 390 12
need 0 390 12
to 0 390 12
remember 0 390 12
here 0 390 12
is, 0 390 12
this 0 390 12
isn’t 0 390 12
about 0 390 12
democrats 0 390 12
vs 0 390 12
republicans, 0 390 12
it’s 0 390 12
about 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
elite 1 390 12
preserving 0 390 12
their 0 390 12
control, 0 390 12
and 0 390 12
at 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
moment, 0 390 12
they 0 390 12
are 0 390 12
using 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
DNC 0 390 12
as 0 390 12
the 0 390 12
mouthpiece 0 390 12
for 0 390 12
that. 0 390 12

Thus, 0 390 13
anything 0 390 13
that 0 390 13
slandered 0 390 13
Hillary 0 390 13
Clinton 0 390 13
during 0 390 13
the 0 390 13
presidential 0 390 13
campaign, 0 390 13
for 0 390 13
example, 0 390 13
was 0 390 13
labelled 0 390 13
as 0 390 13
fake 0 390 13

credible 0 390 13
sources 0 390 13
were 0 390 13

This 0 390 14
is 0 390 14
because 0 390 14
she 0 390 14
is 0 390 14
part 0 390 14
of 0 390 14
that 0 390 14
elite. 1 390 14

take 0 390 18
on 0 390 18

Facebook 0 390 31
has 0 390 31
become 0 390 31
a 0 390 31
revolving 0 390 31
door 0 390 31
like 0 390 31
Monsanto, 0 390 31
with 0 390 31
high-ranking 0 390 31
DARPA 0 390 31
employees, 0 390 31
like 0 390 31
Regina 0 390 31

who 0 390 31
has 0 390 31

now 0 390 31
spearheading 0 390 31

What 0 390 32
is 0 390 32
Facebook’s 0 390 32
mission? 0 390 32

Well 0 390 33
at 0 390 33
the 0 390 33
moment 0 390 33
it 0 390 33
seems 0 390 33
to 0 390 33
be 0 390 33
censoring 0 390 33
of 0 390 33
information. 0 390 33

Their 0 390 34
key 0 390 34
strategy 0 390 34
is 0 390 34
to 0 390 34
label 0 390 34
everything 0 390 34
as 0 390 34
fake 0 390 34
news 0 390 34

You 0 390 35
see, 0 390 35
independent 0 390 35
media, 0 390 35
like 0 390 35
CE, 0 390 35
became 0 390 35
extremely 0 390 35
popular, 0 390 35
receiving 0 390 35
many 0 390 35
millions 0 390 35
in 0 390 35
website 0 390 35
every 0 390 35
single 0 390 35
month, 0 390 35
that 0 390 35
traffic 0 390 35
came 0 390 35
from 0 390 35
Facebook. 0 390 35

Independent 0 390 36
media 0 390 36
outlets 0 390 36
were 0 390 36
greatly 0 390 36
surpassing 0 390 36
mainstream 0 390 36
media 0 390 36
in 0 390 36
their 0 390 36
power 0 390 36

This 0 390 37
is 0 390 37
something 0 390 37
people 0 390 37
on 0 390 37
the 0 390 37
outside 0 390 37
can’t 0 390 37
really 0 390 37
see 0 390 37
as 0 390 37
all 0 390 37
of 0 390 37
this 0 390 37
happens, 0 390 37
but 0 390 37
I 0 390 37
am 0 390 37
on 0 390 37
the 0 390 37
inside, 0 390 37
so 0 390 37
I 0 390 37
see 0 390 37
exactly 0 390 37
what’s 0 390 37
taking 0 390 37
place. 0 390 37

Eyes 0 390 38
were 0 390 38
shifting 0 390 38
away 0 390 38
from 0 390 38
the 0 390 38
small 0 390 38
group 0 390 38
of 0 390 38
people 0 390 38
who 0 390 38
have 0 390 38
controlled 0 390 38
media 0 390 38
since 0 390 38
media’s 0 390 38
inception. 0 390 38

Independent 0 390 39
media 0 390 39
brought 0 390 39
to 0 390 39
light 0 390 39
a 0 390 39
number 0 390 39
of 0 390 39
facts 0 390 39
that 0 390 39
threaten 0 390 39
the 0 390 39
agenda 0 390 39
of 0 390 39
the 0 390 39
global 1 390 39
elite, 1 390 39
like 0 390 39
intelligence 0 390 39
agency/government 0 390 39
connections 0 390 39
to 0 390 39
mainstream 0 390 39
media 0 390 39
for 0 390 39
example, 0 390 39
and 0 390 39
their 0 390 39
plans 0 390 39
in 0 390 39
the 0 390 39
middle 0 390 39
east 0 390 39
to 0 390 39
basically 0 390 39
invade, 0 390 39
take-over, 0 390 39
and 0 390 39
establish 0 390 39
a 0 390 39
government 0 390 39
that 0 390 39
suits 0 390 39
the 0 390 39
Deep 0 390 39
State’s 0 390 39
best 0 390 39
interests. 0 390 39

There 0 390 40
are 0 390 40
several 0 390 40
examples 0 390 40
from 0 390 40
all 0 390 40
fields 0 390 40
that 0 390 40
surround 0 390 40
human 0 390 40
life, 0 390 40
from 0 390 40
healthcare 0 390 40
to 0 390 40
politics, 0 390 40
and 0 390 40
it 0 390 40
all 0 390 40
seems 0 390 40
to 0 390 40
be 0 390 40
controlled 0 390 40
by 0 390 40
one 0 390 40
massive 0 390 40
conglomerate 0 390 40
at 0 390 40
the 0 390 40
top. 0 390 40

We’ve 0 390 41
been 0 390 41
writing 0 390 41
about 0 390 41
this 0 390 41
for 0 390 41
nearly 0 390 41
a 0 390 41
decade 0 390 41
now. 0 390 41

The 0 390 42
Deep 0 390 42
State 0 390 42
Has 0 390 42
Power 0 390 42
Due 0 390 42
To 0 390 42
Our 0 390 42
Unconsciousness 0 390 42

They 0 390 43
(global 1 390 43
elite) 1 390 43
continue 0 390 43
to 0 390 43
do 0 390 43
what 0 390 43
they 0 390 43
are 0 390 43
able 0 390 43
to 0 390 43
do 0 390 43
because 0 390 43
of 0 390 43
human 0 390 43
consciousness. 0 390 43

The 0 390 44
more 0 390 44
people 0 390 44
who 0 390 44
consider 0 390 44
this 0 390 44
a 0 390 44
“conspiracy 0 390 44
theory” 0 390 44
and 0 390 44
turn 0 390 44
their 0 390 44
heads 0 390 44
away, 0 390 44
the 0 390 44
easier 0 390 44
it 0 390 44
is 0 390 44
for 0 390 44
them 0 390 44
to 0 390 44
continue 0 390 44
and 0 390 44
have 0 390 44
power. 0 390 44

I 0 390 45
don’t 0 390 45
understand 0 390 45
how 0 390 45
so 0 390 45
much 0 390 45
information 0 390 45
can 0 390 45
come 0 390 45
to 0 390 45
light, 0 390 45
yet 0 390 45
when 0 390 45
it’s 0 390 45
deemed 0 390 45
a 0 390 45
“conspiracy” 0 390 45
theory” 0 390 45
within 0 390 45
mainstream 0 390 45
media, 0 390 45
everybody 0 390 45
simply 0 390 45
follows 0 390 45
the 0 390 45
rhetoric, 0 390 45
without 0 390 45
doing 0 390 45
any 0 390 45
investigation 0 390 45
or 0 390 45
research 0 390 45
for 0 390 45
themselves. 0 390 45

If 0 390 46
you 0 390 46
don’t 0 390 46
look 0 390 46
into 0 390 46
it, 0 390 46
don’t 0 390 46
share 0 390 46
an 0 390 46
opinion 0 390 46
on 0 390 46
it. 0 390 46

“Condemnation 0 390 47
without 0 390 47
investigation 0 390 47
is 0 390 47
the 0 390 47
height 0 390 47
of 0 390 47
ignorance.” 0 390 47
– 0 390 47
Einstein. 0 390 47

All 0 390 48
of 0 390 48
these 0 390 48
media 0 390 48
sources 0 390 48
were 0 390 48
operating 0 390 48
normally 0 390 48
until 0 390 48
Donald 0 390 48
Trump 0 390 48
became 0 390 48
president, 0 390 48
and 0 390 48
until 0 390 48
Hillary 0 390 48
Clinton, 0 390 48
Obama, 0 390 48
Bush, 0 390 48
etc 0 390 48
were 0 390 48
outed 0 390 48
as 0 390 48
global 1 390 48
elite 1 390 48
puppets. 1 390 48

Heck, 0 390 49
the 0 390 49
Clinton’s 0 390 49
and 0 390 49
John 0 390 49
Podesta 0 390 49
have 0 390 49
even 0 390 49
referenced 0 390 49
Wikileaks 0 390 49
before 0 390 49
that 0 390 49
became 0 390 49
‘fake.’ 0 390 49
Despite 0 390 49
operating 0 390 49
with 0 390 49
credibility 0 390 49
for 0 390 49
more 0 390 49
than 0 390 49
a 0 390 49
decade 0 390 49
before 0 390 49
the 0 390 49
accusations. 0 390 49

What 0 390 50
does 0 390 50
the 0 390 50
media 0 390 50
operating 0 390 50
normally 0 390 50
mean? 0 390 50

Still 0 390 51
manipulating 0 390 51
the 0 390 51
public, 0 390 51
but 0 390 51
at 0 390 51
least 0 390 51
they 0 390 51
were 0 390 51
reporting 0 390 51
on 0 390 51
both 0 390 51
sides 0 390 51
as 0 390 51
a 0 390 51
whole. 0 390 51

Now, 0 390 52
it’s 0 390 52
quite 0 390 52
different. 0 390 52

Donald 0 390 53
Trump 0 390 53
is 0 390 53
extremely 1 390 53
vilified 1 390 53
not 0 390 53
because 0 390 53
he 0 390 53
allegedly 0 390 53
is/was 0 390 53
racist/sexist, 0 390 53
but 0 390 53
because 1 390 53
he 1 390 53
threatens 1 390 53
neoliberalism 1 390 53
and 1 390 53
neoconservatism, 1 390 53
the 1 390 53
American 1 390 53
empire, 1 390 53
one 0 390 53
that 0 390 53
continues 0 390 53
to 0 390 53
try 0 390 53
and 0 390 53
push 0 390 53
an 0 390 53
Orwellian 0 390 53
state 0 390 53
type 0 390 53
of 0 390 53
existence, 0 390 53
which 0 390 53
seems 0 390 53
to 0 390 53
be 0 390 53
ramping 0 390 53
up 0 390 53
every 0 390 53
single 0 390 53
year. 0 390 53

Trump 0 390 54
was 0 390 54
not 0 390 54
supposed 0 390 54
to 0 390 54
win, 0 390 54
and 0 390 54
no 1 390 54
this 1 390 54
isn’t 1 390 54
about 1 390 54
democrats 1 390 54

The 0 390 55
Deep 0 390 55
State 0 390 55
responded 0 390 55
like 0 390 55
they 0 390 55
always 0 390 55
do 0 390 55
every 0 390 55
time 0 390 55
something 0 390 55
‘goes 0 390 55
wrong,’ 0 390 55
they 0 390 55
blamed 0 390 55
Russia, 0 390 55
as 0 390 55
well 0 390 55
as 0 390 55

Some 0 390 56

now 0 390 56
been 0 390 56
deleted 0 390 56
as 0 390 56
mentioned 0 390 56
above. 0 390 56

Trump 1 390 57
is 1 390 57
Not 1 390 57
The 1 390 57
Solution, 1 390 57
We 1 390 57
Are 1 390 57

Things 0 390 58
are 0 390 58
getting 0 390 58
pretty 1 390 58
ridiculous, 1 390 58
but 0 390 58
they’re 0 390 58
too 0 390 58
late. 0 390 58

Even 0 390 59
if 0 390 59
they 0 390 59
do 0 390 59
succeed 0 390 59
in 0 390 59
deleting 0 390 59

Yes, 0 390 60
social 0 390 60

were 0 390 60
great 0 390 60

across 0 390 60
the 0 390 60

it. 0 390 60

It 0 390 61
really 0 390 61

clearly, 0 390 61
we 1 390 61

No 0 390 69
doubt 0 390 69
that 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
Deep 0 390 69

back 0 390 69
the 0 390 69

but 0 390 69
ultimately, 0 390 69
we 0 390 69
need 0 390 69
to 0 390 69
see 0 390 69
the 0 390 69
bigger 0 390 69
picture 0 390 69
here. 0 390 69

We 0 390 70
need 0 390 70
to 0 390 70
see 0 390 70
what 0 390 70
politics 0 390 70
actually 0 390 70
is, 0 390 70
and 0 390 70
the 0 390 70
past 0 390 70
few 0 390 70
years 0 390 70
alone 0 390 70
have 0 390 70
provided 0 390 70
us 0 390 70
with 0 390 70
the 0 390 70
opportunity 0 390 70
to 0 390 70
see. 0 390 70

It’s 0 390 71
nothing 0 390 71
but 0 390 71
elite 1 390 71
people, 0 390 71
corporations 0 390 71
and 0 390 71
the 0 390 71
financial 0 390 71
elite 1 390 71
that 0 390 71
have 0 390 71
become 0 390 71
drenched 0 390 71
with 0 390 71
so 0 390 71
much 0 390 71
power 0 390 71
that 0 390 71
they 0 390 71
have 0 390 71
been 0 390 71
able 0 390 71
to 0 390 71
direct 0 390 71
human 0 390 71
will 0 390 71
and 0 390 71
use 0 390 71
it 0 390 71
for 0 390 71
their 0 390 71
own 0 390 71
selfish 0 390 71
purposes. 0 390 71

With 0 390 72
powerful 1 390 72
revelations 0 390 72
that 0 390 72
have 0 390 72
come 0 390 72
to 0 390 72
light, 0 390 72
like 0 390 72
elite 1 390 72
pedophilia 1 390 72
and 0 390 72
ritual 1 390 72
abuse, 1 390 72
and 0 390 72
extreme 1 390 72
corruption, 0 390 72
why 0 390 72
do 0 390 72
we 0 390 72
still 0 390 72
participate? 0 390 72

Why 0 390 73
do 0 390 73
we 0 390 73
choose 0 390 73
to 0 390 73
elect 0 390 73
these 0 390 73
people? 0 390 73

Why 0 390 74
do 0 390 74
we 0 390 74
believe 0 390 74
we 0 390 74
live 0 390 74
in 0 390 74
a 0 390 74
democracy 0 390 74
when 0 390 74
what 0 390 74
people 0 390 74
want 0 390 74
to 0 390 74
look 0 390 74
at, 0 390 74
and 0 390 74
what 0 390 74
the 0 390 74
majority 0 390 74
of 0 390 74
people 0 390 74
want 0 390 74
to 0 390 74
have 0 390 74
done 0 390 74
(like 0 390 74
GMO-labelling), 0 390 74
is 0 390 74
completely 0 390 74
censored? 0 390 74

Why 0 390 75
are 0 390 75
harmful 1 390 75
‘things’ 0 390 75
surrounding 0 390 75
us 0 390 75
constantly 0 390 75
when 0 390 75
we 0 390 75
have 0 390 75
science 0 390 75
showing 0 390 75
it’s 0 390 75
not 0 390 75
safe, 0 390 75
like 0 390 75
cell 0 390 75
phone 0 390 75
towers 0 390 75
etc. 0 390 75

It’s 0 390 76
simply 0 390 76
because 0 390 76
power 0 390 76
lies 0 390 76
within 0 390 76
the 0 390 76
corporatocracy. 0 390 76

Decisions 0 390 77
aren’t 0 390 77
being 0 390 77
made 0 390 77
with 0 390 77
the 0 390 77
best 0 390 77
interest 0 390 77
of 0 390 77
humanity 0 390 77
at 0 390 77
heart, 0 390 77
and 0 390 77
this 0 390 77
is 0 390 77
why 0 390 77
the 0 390 77
system 0 390 77
is 0 390 77
failing 0 390 77
because 0 390 77
it’s 0 390 77
not 0 390 77
actually 0 390 77
for 0 390 77
the 0 390 77
people. 0 390 77

This 0 390 78

This 0 390 78
group 0 390 78

is 0 390 78
answerable 0 390 78
neither 0 390 78

The 0 390 87
Takeaway 0 390 87

Recognize 0 390 88
what’s 0 390 88
happening, 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
massive 0 390 88
censorship 0 390 88
of 0 390 88
information, 0 390 88
coupled 0 390 88
with 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
ridicule 0 390 88
or 0 390 88
finger 0 390 88
pointing, 0 390 88
or 0 390 88
even 0 390 88
arrest 0 390 88
of 0 390 88
people 0 390 88
who 0 390 88
choose 0 390 88
to 0 390 88
voice 0 390 88
an 0 390 88
opinion 0 390 88
in 0 390 88
opposition 0 390 88
to 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
rhetoric 0 390 88
that’s 0 390 88
constantly 0 390 88
spewed 1 390 88
by 0 390 88
mainstream 0 390 88
media, 0 390 88
which 0 390 88
in 0 390 88
turn 0 390 88
is 0 390 88
usually 0 390 88
believed 0 390 88
by 0 390 88
the 0 390 88
masses. 0 390 88

At 0 390 89
the 0 390 89
same 0 390 89
time, 0 390 89
independent 0 390 89
media 0 390 89
represents 0 390 89
a 0 390 89
shift 0 390 89
in 0 390 89
consciousness. 0 390 89

A 0 390 90
shift 0 390 90
in 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
perceptions, 0 390 90
thoughts, 0 390 90
feelings 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
general 0 390 90
self-awareness 0 390 90
about 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
own 0 390 90
planet 0 390 90
is 0 390 90
changing, 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
thus, 0 390 90
change 0 390 90
has 0 390 90
been 0 390 90
sprouted 0 390 90
in 0 390 90
multiple 0 390 90
different 0 390 90
areas, 0 390 90
including 0 390 90
political 0 390 90
corruption 0 390 90
and 0 390 90
the 0 390 90
stranglehold 0 390 90
it 0 390 90
has 0 390 90
over 0 390 90
our 0 390 90
world. 0 390 90

We 0 390 91
are 0 390 91
more 0 390 91
aware, 0 390 91
but 0 390 91
there 0 390 91
is 0 390 91
still 0 390 91
some 0 390 91
ways 0 390 91
to 0 390 91
go… 0 390 91

A 0 390 92
good 0 390 92
chunk 0 390 92
of 0 390 92
work 0 390 92
has 0 390 92
been 0 390 92
done. 0 390 92

A 0 390 93
massive 1 390 93
transformation 0 390 93
of 0 390 93
consciousness 0 390 93
has 0 390 93
taken 0 390 93
place 0 390 93
and 0 390 93
it 0 390 93
seems 0 390 93
that 0 390 93
a 0 390 93
global 0 390 93
mass 0 390 93
is 0 390 93
growing 0 390 93
closer 0 390 93
to 0 390 93
a 0 390 93
critical 0 390 93
mass. 0 390 93

The 0 390 94
censorship 0 390 94
of 0 390 94
independent 0 390 94
media 0 390 94
is 0 390 94
irrelevant 0 390 94
in 0 390 94
a 0 390 94
sense, 0 390 94
because 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
shift 0 390 94
will 0 390 94
continue 0 390 94
to 0 390 94
happen, 0 390 94
change 0 390 94
will 1 390 94
continue 1 390 94
to 1 390 94
happen, 1 390 94
and 0 390 94
information 0 390 94
that 0 390 94
the 0 390 94

does 0 390 94
not 0 390 94
want 0 390 94
the 0 390 94
public 0 390 94
to 0 390 94
become 0 390 94
aware 0 390 94
of 0 390 94
will 0 390 94
keep 0 390 94
making 0 390 94
its 0 390 94
way 0 390 94
into 0 390 94
transparency. 0 390 94

Independent 0 390 95

will 0 390 95

the 0 390 95
opportunity 0 390 95
to 0 390 95

plain 1 390 95
truth 1 390 95
within 1 390 95
the 1 390 95

People 0 390 96
are 0 390 96

As 0 391 17
The 0 391 17
New 0 391 17
York 0 391 17
Times 0 391 17
reported 0 391 17
early 0 391 17
last 0 391 17
year, 0 391 17
Trump 0 391 17
ordered 0 391 17
the 0 391 17
firing 0 391 17
of 0 391 17
the 0 391 17
special 0 391 17

but 0 391 17
reversed 0 391 17
course 0 391 17
after 0 391 17
the 0 391 17
then-White 0 391 17
House 0 391 17
Counsel 0 391 17
Don 0 391 17
McGahn 0 391 17
said 0 391 17
he 0 391 17
would 0 391 17
resign 1 391 17
instead 1 391 17
of 1 391 17
executing 1 391 17
Trump’s 1 391 17
order. 1 391 17

Still, 0 391 18
even 0 391 18
after 0 391 18
the 0 391 18
Mueller 0 391 18
probe 0 391 18
officially 0 391 18
wraps, 0 391 18
it 0 391 18
is 0 391 18
very 0 391 18
much 0 391 18
the 0 391 18
beginning, 0 391 18
not 0 391 18
a 0 391 18
dramatic 0 391 18
end, 0 391 18
to 0 391 18
Trumpworld’s 1 391 18
wide-ranging 1 391 18
legal 1 391 18
woes. 1 391 18

On 0 391 19
Friday, 0 391 19
The 0 391 19
Washington 0 391 19
Post 0 391 19
reported 0 391 19
that 0 391 19

and 0 391 19
his 0 391 19
investigators. 0 391 19

President 0 391 20
Trump 0 391 20
himself 0 391 20
appears 0 391 20
to 0 391 20
realize 0 391 20
that 0 391 20
the 1 391 20
end 1 391 20
is 1 391 20
nowhere 1 391 20
near. 1 391 20

As 0 391 21
The 0 391 21
Daily 0 391 21
Beast 0 391 21
reported 0 391 21
last 0 391 21
month, 0 391 21
the 0 391 21
president 0 391 21
made 0 391 21
clear 0 391 21
to 0 391 21
his 0 391 21
outside 0 391 21
legal 0 391 21
team, 0 391 21
which 0 391 21
includes 0 391 21
Giuliani 0 391 21
and 0 391 21
Jay 0 391 21
Sekulow, 0 391 21
that 0 391 21
he 0 391 21
wanted 0 391 21
his 0 391 21
attorneys 0 391 21
sitting 0 391 21
tight, 0 391 21
even 0 391 21
after 0 391 21
the 0 391 21
Mueller 0 391 21
investigation 0 391 21
is 0 391 21
history. 0 391 21

Trump 0 391 22
broached 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
topic 0 391 22
in 0 391 22
multiple 0 391 22
conversations 0 391 22
beginning 0 391 22
late 0 391 22
last 0 391 22
year, 0 391 22
while 0 391 22
discussing 0 391 22
the 0 391 22
other 0 391 22
inquiries 0 391 22
threatening 0 391 22

Southern 0 391 22

of 0 391 22

But 0 391 23
if 0 391 23
the 0 391 23
Mueller 0 391 23
report 0 391 23
is 0 391 23
actually, 0 391 23

on 0 391 23
Friday, 0 391 23
the 0 391 23

many 0 391 23

On 0 391 24
Friday 0 391 24

Facebook 0 400 17
page, 0 400 17
which 0 400 17
Jamie 0 400 17
helped 0 400 17
run 0 400 17
with 0 400 17
CJC 0 400 17
President 0 400 17
Steve 0 400 17
Amundson, 0 400 17
was 0 400 17
removed 0 400 17
a 0 400 17
few 0 400 17
years 0 400 17
ago 0 400 17
with 1 400 17
absolutely 1 400 17
no 1 400 17
explanation. 1 400 17

The 0 400 18
CJC 0 400 18
is 0 400 18
a 0 400 18
human 0 400 18
rights 0 400 18
and 0 400 18
pro-national 0 400 18
security 0 400 18
group 0 400 18
that 0 400 18
is 0 400 18
dedicated 0 400 18
to 0 400 18
protecting 0 400 18
America 0 400 18
and 0 400 18
the 0 400 18
West 0 400 18
from 0 400 18
Jihad 0 400 18
-- 0 400 18
and 0 400 18
Muslim 0 400 18
and 0 400 18
non-Muslim 0 400 18
people 0 400 18
from 0 400 18
Sharia 0 400 18
oppression. 0 400 18

The 0 400 19
question 0 400 19
remains: 0 400 19
why 1 400 19
would 1 400 19
Facebook 1 400 19
remove 1 400 19
such 1 400 19
a 1 400 19
page, 1 400 19
let 1 400 19
alone 1 400 19
in 1 400 19
such 1 400 19
a 1 400 19
fascistic 1 400 19
manner 1 400 19
-- 1 400 19
and 1 400 19
never 1 400 19
explain 1 400 19
why? 1 400 19

In 0 400 20
April 0 400 20
earlier 0 400 20
this 0 400 20
year, 0 400 20
Jamie 0 400 20
was 0 400 20
suspended 0 400 20
from 0 400 20
Facebook 0 400 20
for 0 400 20
posting 0 400 20
screenshots 0 400 20
of 0 400 20
a 0 400 20
Muslim's 0 400 20
threat 0 400 20
to 0 400 20
him 0 400 20
on 0 400 20
the 0 400 20
platform. 0 400 20

Then, 0 400 21
in 0 400 21
May, 0 400 21
his 0 400 21
Twitter 0 400 21
account 0 400 21
was 0 400 21
temporarily 0 400 21
suspended 0 400 21
and 0 400 21
he 0 400 21
was 0 400 21
forced 0 400 21
to 0 400 21
delete 0 400 21
tweets 0 400 21
he 0 400 21
posted 0 400 21
which 0 400 21
directly 0 400 21
quoted 0 400 21
Islamic 0 400 21
religious 0 400 21
texts. 0 400 21

His 0 400 22
account 0 400 22
was 0 400 22
suspended 0 400 22
for 0 400 22
violating 0 400 22
Twitter’s 0 400 22
rules 0 400 22
relating 0 400 22
to 0 400 22
“hateful 1 400 22
conduct.” 1 400 22
It 0 400 22
is 0 400 22
"hateful 1 400 22
conduct", 1 400 22
apparently, 0 400 22
to 0 400 22
reference 0 400 22
what 0 400 22
Islamic 0 400 22
texts 0 400 22
themselves 0 400 22
say. 0 400 22

Indeed, 0 400 23
Frontpage's 0 400 23
editor 0 400 23
had 0 400 23
simply 0 400 23
referred 0 400 23
to 0 400 23
Sahih 0 400 23
Bukhari’s 0 400 23
texts 0 400 23
discussing 0 400 23
Mohammed’s 0 400 23
marriage 0 400 23
to 0 400 23
Aisha 0 400 23
when 0 400 23
she 0 400 23
was 0 400 23
six 0 400 23
years 0 400 23
old 0 400 23
(7.62.88) 0 400 23
and 0 400 23
to 0 400 23
Qur'anic 0 400 23
Suras 0 400 23
that 0 400 23
mandate 0 400 23

One 0 400 24
thing 0 400 24
we 0 400 24
know 0 400 24
for 0 400 24
sure 0 400 24
is 0 400 24
that, 0 400 24
despite 0 400 24
this 0 400 24
lifting 0 400 24

many 0 400 25

that 0 400 35

somehow 0 400 35
“a 0 400 35
racially 1 400 35

-- 0 400 35
a 1 400 35
vicious 1 400 35
lie 1 400 35
that 0 400 35
Frontpage 0 400 35

apologize 0 400 35

issue 0 400 35
a 0 400 35
retraction. 0 400 35

(To 0 400 36
learn 0 400 36
why 0 400 36
David 0 400 36

is 0 400 36
one 0 400 36

sure 0 400 36
to 0 400 36

Thus, 0 400 37
we 0 400 37
clearly 0 400 37
gauge 0 400 37
that 0 400 37
there 0 400 37

which 0 400 37
the 0 400 37

not 0 400 37
stoop 0 400 37
in 0 400 37
its 0 400 37

Yes, 0 400 38
Frontpage 0 400 38

it 0 400 38

only, 0 400 38
obviously, 0 400 38
a 0 400 38
very 0 400 38
tiny 0 400 38

During 0 401 3
it, 0 401 3
Mr. 0 401 3

that 0 401 3

of 1 401 13
Islam,” 1 401 13
said 1 401 13
that 1 401 13
while 1 401 13
estimates 1 401 13
ranged 1 401 13
wildly 1 401 13
about 1 401 13
how 1 401 13
many 1 401 13
bona 1 401 13

members 1 401 13
belonged 1 401 13
to 1 401 13
the 1 401 13
Nation, 1 401 13
he 1 401 13
believes 1 401 13
that 1 401 13
there 1 401 13
were 1 401 13
tens 1 401 13

early 1 401 13
1970s. 1 401 13

But 1 401 14
he 1 401 14
said 1 401 14
that 1 401 14
millions 1 401 14

with 1 401 14

Who 0 401 15

Eugene 0 401 16
Walcott 0 401 16
in 0 401 16
New 0 401 16
York 0 401 16
in 0 401 16
1933, 0 401 16
Mr. 0 401 16
Farrakhan 0 401 16
joined 0 401 16
the 0 401 16
Nation 0 401 16
of 0 401 16
Islam 0 401 16
in 0 401 16
the 0 401 16
mid-1950s 0 401 16
and 0 401 16
rose 0 401 16
quickly 0 401 16
within 0 401 16
the 0 401 16
organization, 0 401 16
becoming 0 401 16
close 0 401 16
to 0 401 16
Malcolm 0 401 16
X. 0 401 16

After 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
assassination 0 401 17
of 0 401 17
Malcolm 0 401 17
X 0 401 17
in 0 401 17
1965, 0 401 17
he 0 401 17
became 0 401 17
one 0 401 17
of 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
most 0 401 17
powerful 0 401 17
members 0 401 17
of 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
Nation 0 401 17
and 0 401 17
its 0 401 17
chief 0 401 17
spokesman, 0 401 17
the 0 401 17
position 0 401 17
that 0 401 17
Malcolm 0 401 17
X 0 401 17
had 0 401 17
held. 0 401 17

The 0 401 18
Nation 0 401 18
of 0 401 18
Islam 0 401 18
had 0 401 18
gained 0 401 18
followers 0 401 18
around 0 401 18
the 0 401 18
nation 0 401 18
in 0 401 18
the 0 401 18
1940s 0 401 18
and 0 401 18
’50s 0 401 18
by 0 401 18
providing 0 401 18
something 0 401 18
of 0 401 18
a 0 401 18
religious 0 401 18
answer 0 401 18
to 0 401 18
antiblack 0 401 18
racism. 0 401 18

It 0 401 19
was 0 401 19
not 0 401 19
widely 0 401 19
recognized 0 401 19
as 0 401 19
an 0 401 19
anti-Jewish 0 401 19
organization 0 401 19
during 0 401 19
its 0 401 19
early 0 401 19
years 0 401 19
(its 0 401 19
early 0 401 19
literature, 0 401 19
though, 0 401 19
focused 0 401 19
on 0 401 19
“the 1 401 19
white 1 401 19
man” 1 401 19
as 1 401 19
“the 1 401 19
white 1 401 19
devil”). 1 401 19

But 0 401 20
in 0 401 20
1967, 0 401 20
it 0 401 20
became 0 401 20
outspokenly 1 401 20
and 1 401 20
flagrantly 1 401 20
anti-Zionist, 1 401 20
in 0 401 20
an 0 401 20
expression 0 401 20
of 0 401 20
solidarity 0 401 20
with 0 401 20
Palestinians. 0 401 20

That 0 401 21
political 0 401 21
position 0 401 21
became 0 401 21
a 0 401 21
vehicle 0 401 21
for 0 401 21
Mr. 0 401 21
Farrakhan 0 401 21
to 0 401 21
express 0 401 21
his 0 401 21
anti-Semitism. 0 401 21

(Among 0 401 22
his 0 401 22
more 0 401 22
infamous 0 401 22
comments 0 401 22
is 0 401 22
his 1 401 22
1984 1 401 22
description 1 401 22
of 1 401 22
Adolf 1 401 22
Hitler 1 401 22
as 1 401 22
“a 1 401 22
very 1 401 22
great 1 401 22
man.”) 1 401 22

In 0 401 23
1975, 0 401 23
when 0 401 23
Elijah 0 401 23
Muhammad 0 401 23
died, 0 401 23
the 0 401 23
Nation 0 401 23
split 0 401 23
into 0 401 23
two 0 401 23
factions. 0 401 23

The 0 401 24
faction 0 401 24
reconstituted 0 401 24
under 0 401 24
Mr. 0 401 24

in 0 401 24
the 0 401 24
late 0 401 24
1970s 0 401 24
retained 0 401 24
the 0 401 24
original 0 401 24
name, 0 401 24
though 0 401 24
not 0 401 24
the 0 401 24
influence 0 401 24
or 0 401 24
support 0 401 24
that 0 401 24

this 0 405 45

Reaganite 0 406 15
traditionalism 0 406 15
and 0 406 15
conservatism, 0 406 15
are: 0 406 15

First, 0 406 16
the 0 406 16
hubristic 0 406 16
drive, 0 406 16
despite 0 406 16
the 0 406 16
warnings 0 406 16
of 0 406 16
statesmen 0 406 16
like 0 406 16
George 0 406 16
Kennan, 0 406 16
to 0 406 16
exploit 0 406 16
our 0 406 16
Cold 0 406 16
War 0 406 16
victory 0 406 16
and 0 406 16
pursue 0 406 16
a 0 406 16
policy 0 406 16
of 0 406 16
permanent 0 406 16
containment 0 406 16
of 0 406 16
a 0 406 16
Russia 0 406 16
that 0 406 16
had 0 406 16
lost 0 406 16
a 0 406 16
third 0 406 16
of 0 406 16
its 0 406 16
territory 0 406 16
and 0 406 16
half 0 406 16
its 0 406 16
people. 0 406 16

We 0 406 17
moved 0 406 17
NATO 0 406 17
into 0 406 17
Eastern 0 406 17
Europe 0 406 17
and 0 406 17
the 0 406 17
Baltic, 0 406 17
onto 0 406 17
her 0 406 17
doorstep. 0 406 17

We 0 406 18
abrogated 0 406 18
the 0 406 18
ABM 0 406 18
treaty 0 406 18
Nixon 0 406 18
had 0 406 18

John 0 406 19
McCain 0 406 19
pushed 0 406 19
to 0 406 19
bring 0 406 19
Ukraine 0 406 19

Georgia 0 406 19
into 0 406 19
NATO, 0 406 19
and 0 406 19
even 0 406 19
to 0 406 19
send 0 406 19

Thus 0 406 20
we 0 406 20
got 0 406 20
a 0 406 20
second 0 406 20

that 0 406 20
our 0 406 20
allies 0 406 20
seem 0 406 20
content 0 406 20
to 0 406 20
let 0 406 20
us 0 406 20
fight 0 406 20
alone. 0 406 20

Europe 0 406 21
today 0 406 21
is 0 406 21
not 0 406 21
afraid 0 406 21

Let 0 406 23
the 1 406 23
Americans, 1 406 23
who 0 406 23
relish 0 406 23
playing 0 406 23

whom 0 423 15
he 0 423 15

“Orbán 0 423 16

The 0 423 17

continued: 0 423 17

Soros, 0 423 18
for 0 423 18
his 0 423 18
part, 0 423 18
compared 1 423 18
Orbán 1 423 18
unfavourably 1 423 18
to 1 423 18
both 1 423 18
the 1 423 18
Nazis 1 423 18
and 1 423 18
the 1 423 18
Communists, 1 423 18
saying 0 423 18
his 0 423 18
rule 0 423 18
evoked 0 423 18
dark 0 423 18
tones 0 423 18
from 0 423 18
the 0 423 18
1930's, 0 423 18
when 0 423 18
Hungary 0 423 18
was 0 423 18
allied 0 423 18
with 0 423 18
Nazi 0 423 18
Germany. 0 423 18

But 0 423 19
Orbán 0 423 19
remains 0 423 19
committed 0 423 19
to 0 423 19
his 0 423 19
policy, 0 423 19
claiming 0 423 19
that 0 423 19
Soros 0 423 19
and 0 423 19
supporters 0 423 19
of 0 423 19
migration 0 423 19
are 0 423 19
losing 0 423 19
the 0 423 19
fight. 0 423 19

He 0 423 20
said: 0 423 20
“Soros 0 423 20
has 0 423 20
antagonised 0 423 20
not 0 423 20
only 0 423 20
us 0 423 20
but 0 423 20
also 0 423 20
England, 0 423 20
President 0 423 20
Trump 0 423 20
and 0 423 20
Israel 0 423 20
too. 0 423 20

Everywhere 0 423 21
he 0 423 21
wants 0 423 21
to 0 423 21
get 0 423 21
migration 0 423 21
accepted. 0 423 21

It 0 423 22
won't 0 423 22
work. 0 423 22

We 0 423 23
are 0 423 23
not 0 423 23
alone 0 423 23
and 0 423 23
we 0 423 23
will 0 423 23

together 0 423 23
and 0 423 23
we 0 423 23
will 0 423 23
succeed.” 0 423 23

In 0 423 24
addition 0 423 24
to 0 423 24
inviting 0 423 24

ire, 0 423 24

as 0 423 24
the 0 423 24

for 0 423 24
purportedly 0 423 24
discriminating 0 423 24
against 0 423 24
homosexuals 0 423 24
because 0 423 24
of 0 423 24
Hungary’s 0 423 24
insistence 0 423 24
on 0 423 24
defining 0 423 24

Last 0 423 25
year, 0 423 25
Orbán 0 423 25
also 0 423 25
criticized 0 423 25

encouraged 0 423 25

the 0 435 3

in 0 435 3
a 0 435 3
moderate 0 435 3

These 0 435 4

are 0 435 4
now 0 435 4
making 0 435 4
their 0 435 4
way 0 435 4

Earth. 0 435 4

The 0 435 5
planet’s 0 435 5

block 0 435 5

some 0 435 5
will 0 435 5
make 0 435 5
it 0 435 5
into 0 435 5
Earth’s 0 435 5

And 0 435 7
some 0 435 7
say 0 435 7
this 0 435 7

could 0 435 7
be 0 435 7
quite 0 435 7

A 1 435 18

it’s 1 435 18
