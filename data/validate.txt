That’s 0 20 12
right, 0 20 12
photographic 0 20 12
evidence 0 20 12
from 0 20 12
inside 0 20 12
the 0 20 12

that 0 20 12
the 0 20 12
FBI, 0 20 12
along 0 20 12
with 0 20 12
state 0 20 12

key 0 20 12
details 0 20 12
of 0 20 12
the 0 20 12

This 1 20 13
throws 1 20 13
their 1 20 13
entire 1 20 13
narrative 1 20 13
into 1 20 13
question 1 20 13
and 1 20 13
makes 1 20 13
one 1 20 13
wonder 1 20 13
what 1 20 13
else 1 20 13
is 1 20 13
being 1 20 13
hidden 1 20 13
from 1 20 13
the 1 20 13
public? 1 20 13

Keep 0 20 14
in 0 20 14
mind 0 20 14
that 0 20 14
at 0 20 14
least 0 20 14
four 0 20 14
videos 0 20 14
from 0 20 14
the 0 20 14
scene 0 20 14
of 0 20 14
the 0 20 14
shooting 0 20 14
have 0 20 14
already 0 20 14
been 0 20 14
released 0 20 14
that 0 20 14
indicate 0 20 14
there 0 20 14
were 0 20 14
multiple 0 20 14
shooters. 0 20 14

In 0 20 15
fact, 0 20 15
there 0 20 15
are 0 20 15
so 0 20 15
many 0 20 15
unanswered 0 20 15
questions 0 20 15
that 0 20 15
the 0 20 15
Drudge 0 20 15

even 0 20 15
linked 0 20 15
to 0 20 15
an 0 20 15
article 0 20 15
asking 0 20 15
them 0 20 15
directly. 0 20 15

As 0 20 16
noted 0 20 16
above, 0 20 16
at 0 20 16
this 0 20 16
point 0 20 16
literally 0 20 16
every 0 20 16
piece 0 20 16
of 0 20 16
so-called 1 20 16
evidence 1 20 16
put 0 20 16
forth 0 20 16
by 0 20 16
authorities 0 20 16
and 0 20 16
then 0 20 16
regurgitated 0 20 16
by 0 20 16
the 0 20 16
mainstream 0 20 16
media 0 20 16
cannot 1 20 16
be 1 20 16
trusted 1 20 16
and 1 20 16

be 1 20 16
considered 1 20 16
as 1 20 16
disinformation 1 20 16
until 0 20 16
proven 0 20 16
otherwise. 0 20 16

And 0 20 17
if 0 20 17
Paddock 0 20 17
really 0 20 17
did 0 20 17
act 0 20 17
alone 0 20 17
and 0 20 17
this 0 20 17
evidence 0 20 17
is 0 20 17
some 0 20 17
sort 0 20 17
of 0 20 17
mistake, 0 20 17
there 0 20 17
is 0 20 17
surely 0 20 17

The 0 24 4
Daily 0 24 4
Sheeple, 0 24 4
the 0 24 4

the 0 24 4

was 0 24 5
actually 0 24 5

BEFORE 0 24 5

constantly 1 24 6
changing 1 24 6

are 0 24 6

“until 0 24 6

after 0 24 6

Lombardo 0 24 6
said. 0 24 6

The 0 24 7
security 0 24 7
guard, 0 24 7
Jesus 0 24 7
Campos, 0 24 7
was 0 24 7
struck 0 24 7
in 0 24 7
the 0 24 7

as 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
gunman, 0 24 7
from 0 24 7
behind 0 24 7
his 0 24 7

on 0 24 7
the 0 24 7
32nd 0 24 7

apparently 0 24 8
detected 0 24 8

via 0 24 8

cameras 0 24 8
he 0 24 8

his 0 24 8
hotel 0 24 8

have 0 24 8
said. 0 24 8

Paddock 0 24 9
shot 0 24 9
the 0 24 9
guard 0 24 9
at 0 24 9
9:59 0 24 9
p.m. 0 24 9
local 0 24 9

Lombardo 0 24 9
said, 0 24 9
shortly 0 24 9
before 0 24 9
raining 0 24 9
down 0 24 9

on 0 24 9

at 0 24 9

and 0 24 9
lasted 0 24 9

when 0 24 10
they 0 24 10
arrived 0 24 10
on 0 24 10
the 0 24 10
floor. 0 24 10

And 0 24 11
Campos 0 24 11
did 0 24 11
not 0 24 11
summon 0 24 11
police 0 24 11
to 0 24 11
the 0 24 11

What’s 0 24 12
also 0 24 12
incredibly 0 24 12
interesting, 0 24 12
is 0 24 12
that 0 24 12

What 0 24 16
happened 0 24 16
during 0 24 16
the 0 24 16
6 0 24 16
minutes 0 24 16

and 0 24 16
why 1 24 16
weren’t 1 24 16

rushing 1 24 16
to 1 24 16
the 1 24 16

immediately? 1 24 16

Why 0 24 17
did 0 24 17
shooter 0 24 17
Stephen 0 24 17
Paddock 0 24 17
stop 0 24 17
shooting? 0 24 17

Paddock 0 24 18
had 0 24 18
already 0 24 18
shot 0 24 18
the 0 24 18
security 0 24 18

waited 0 24 18
six 0 24 18

and 0 24 18
then 0 24 18
shot 0 24 18
for 0 24 18
a 0 24 18
full 0 24 18
ten 0 24 18
minutes. 0 24 18

Police 0 24 19
didn’t 0 24 19
arrive 0 24 19
for 0 24 19
two 0 24 19
additional 0 24 19
minutes 0 24 19
after 0 24 19
the 0 24 19
shooting 0 24 19
stopped 0 24 19
– 0 24 19
which 0 24 19
is 0 24 19
a 0 24 19
full 0 24 19
18 0 24 19
minutes 0 24 19
from 0 24 19
the 0 24 19
moment 0 24 19
Campos 0 24 19
was 0 24 19
initially 0 24 19
hit. 0 24 19

Moreover, 0 24 20
did 0 24 20
he 0 24 20
stop 0 24 20
shooting 0 24 20
because 0 24 20
he 0 24 20
was 0 24 20

his 0 24 20
escape 0 24 20
from 0 24 20
the 0 24 20

floor? 0 24 20

Or 0 24 21
is 0 24 21
it 0 24 21
possible 0 24 21
that 0 24 21
Paddock 0 24 21
was 0 24 21

Mr. 1 27 6

bases 1 27 6
his 1 27 6

the 1 27 6

is 0 27 11
a 0 27 11
good 0 27 11
theologian 0 27 11
and 0 27 11
a 0 27 11
fine 0 27 11
man, 0 27 11
but 0 27 11
he 0 27 11
still 0 27 11
seems 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
believe 0 27 11
that 0 27 11
AL 0 27 11
303 0 27 11
implies 0 27 11
that 0 27 11
God 0 27 11
is 0 27 11
asking 0 27 11
people 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
continue 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
sin 0 27 11
in 0 27 11
some 0 27 11
cases. 0 27 11

In 0 27 12
his 0 27 12
April 0 27 12
22, 0 27 12
2016 0 27 12
article 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
Catholic 0 27 12
World 0 27 12
Report, 0 27 12
Brugger 0 27 12
writes 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
AL 0 27 12
303 0 27 12
suggests 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
“God 0 27 12
can 0 27 12
be 0 27 12
‘asking’ 0 27 12
someone 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
live 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
a 0 27 12
life-state 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
which 0 27 12
they 0 27 12
are 0 27 12
objectively 0 27 12
violating 0 27 12
grave 0 27 12
matter.” 0 27 12
Then 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
a 0 27 12
Sept. 0 27 12
28 0 27 12
‘17 0 27 12
LifeSiteNews 0 27 12
article, 0 27 12
he 0 27 12
states 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
“the 0 27 12
generous 0 27 12
response” 0 27 12
owed 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
God 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
“a 0 27 12
certain 0 27 12
state 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
objectively 0 27 12
at 0 27 12
variance 0 27 12
with 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
universal 0 27 12
command 0 27 12
of 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
Gospel.” 0 27 12
Now 0 27 12
Prof. 0 27 12
Brugger 0 27 12
argues 0 27 12
that, 0 27 12
because 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
subject 0 27 12
remains 0 27 12
“this 0 27 12
conscience” 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
AL 0 27 12
303, 0 27 12
this 0 27 12
proves 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
“generous 0 27 12
offering 0 27 12
owed 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
God” 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
recognition 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
one 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
living 0 27 12
“contrary 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
“the 0 27 12
universal 0 27 12
command 0 27 12
of 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
Gospel.” 0 27 12

Prof. 0 27 13
Brugger 0 27 13
fails 0 27 13
to 0 27 13
see 0 27 13
that 0 27 13
AL 0 27 13
303 0 27 13
clearly 0 27 13
distinguishes 0 27 13
between 0 27 13
a 0 27 13
conscience’s 0 27 13
recognition 0 27 13
that 0 27 13
“a 0 27 13
given 0 27 13
situation 0 27 13
is 0 27 13
objectively 0 27 13
at 0 27 13
variance 0 27 13
with 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
general 0 27 13
mandate 0 27 13
of 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
Gospel” 0 27 13
and 0 27 13
this 0 27 13
same 0 27 13
conscience’s 0 27 13
subsequent 0 27 13
recognition 0 27 13
of 0 27 13
a 0 27 13
“generous 0 27 13
response 0 27 13
owed 0 27 13
to 0 27 13
God 0 27 13
in 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
present 0 27 13
circumstances.” 0 27 13
The 0 27 13
subject 0 27 13
“conscience” 0 27 13
might 0 27 13
be 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
same 0 27 13
but 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
object 0 27 13
is 0 27 13
different. 0 27 13

The 0 27 14
“generous 0 27 14
response” 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
not 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
situation 0 27 14
that 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
at 0 27 14
variance 0 27 14
with 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
command 0 27 14
of 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
Gospel 0 27 14
but 0 27 14
an 0 27 14
offering 0 27 14
that 0 27 14
God 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
asking 0 27 14
amid 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
mass 0 27 14
of 0 27 14
impediments 0 27 14
even 0 27 14
though 0 27 14
it 0 27 14
may 0 27 14
not 0 27 14
yet 0 27 14
be 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
perfect 0 27 14
objective 0 27 14

model. 0 27 15
What 0 27 15
might 0 27 15
be 0 27 15
this 0 27 15
“generous 0 27 15
response?” 0 27 15
Pope 0 27 15
Francis 0 27 15
does 0 27 15
not 0 27 15
give 0 27 15
an 0 27 15
example 0 27 15
in 0 27 15
AL 0 27 15
303 0 27 15
because 0 27 15
he’s 0 27 15
speaking 0 27 15
in 0 27 15
general 0 27 15
terms 0 27 15
of 0 27 15
the 0 27 15
dynamics 0 27 15
of 0 27 15
conscience. 0 27 15

Moreover, 0 27 16
he 0 27 16
knows 0 27 16
that 0 27 16
concrete 0 27 16
cases 0 27 16
vary 0 27 16

widely. 0 27 17
In 0 27 17
our 0 27 17
Sept. 0 27 17
26 0 27 17
article 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
La 0 27 17
Stampa, 0 27 17
Dr. 0 27 17
Goldstein 0 27 17
and 0 27 17
I 0 27 17
provided 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
hypothetical 0 27 17
example 0 27 17
of 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
couple 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
purely 0 27 17
civil 0 27 17
“marriage” 0 27 17
recognizing 0 27 17
that 0 27 17
God 0 27 17
is 0 27 17
calling 0 27 17
them 0 27 17
to 0 27 17
live 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
continence. 0 27 17

We 0 27 18
chose 0 27 18
this 0 27 18
example 0 27 18
deliberately 0 27 18
to 0 27 18
demonstrate 0 27 18
that 0 27 18
“the 0 27 18
generous 0 27 18
response” 0 27 18
could 0 27 18
be 0 27 18
the 0 27 18
ending 0 27 18
of 0 27 18
a 0 27 18
particular 0 27 18

sin. 0 27 19
Our 0 27 19
example 0 27 19
was 0 27 19
an 0 27 19
attempt 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
show 0 27 19
that 0 27 19
Professors 0 27 19
Brugger 0 27 19
and 0 27 19
Seifert 0 27 19
are 0 27 19
wrong 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
believe 0 27 19
AL 0 27 19
303 0 27 19
implies 0 27 19
that 0 27 19
God 0 27 19
is 0 27 19
asking 0 27 19
some 0 27 19
people 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
continue 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
live 0 27 19
in 0 27 19
an 0 27 19
objectively 0 27 19
sinful 0 27 19

state. 0 27 20
It’s 0 27 20
really 0 27 20
just 0 27 20
the 0 27 20
opposite. 0 27 20

AL 0 27 21
303 0 27 21
teaches 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
conscience 0 27 21
will 0 27 21
come 0 27 21
to 0 27 21
recognize 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
God 0 27 21
is 0 27 21
asking 0 27 21
for 0 27 21
a 0 27 21
step 0 27 21
in 0 27 21
the 0 27 21
right 0 27 21
direction 0 27 21
away 0 27 21
from 0 27 21

sin. 0 27 22
Pope 1 27 22
Francis 1 27 22
explains 1 27 22
this 1 27 22
again 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
AL 1 27 22
305 1 27 22
when 1 27 22
he 1 27 22
says 1 27 22
“a 1 27 22
small 1 27 22
step, 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
the 1 27 22
midst 1 27 22
of 1 27 22
great 1 27 22
human 1 27 22
limitations, 1 27 22
can 1 27 22
be 1 27 22
more 1 27 22
pleasing 1 27 22
to 1 27 22
God 1 27 22
than 1 27 22
a 1 27 22
life 1 27 22
which 1 27 22
appears 1 27 22
outwardly 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
order, 1 27 22
but 0 27 22
moves 0 27 22
through 0 27 22
the 0 27 22
day 0 27 22
without 0 27 22
confronting 0 27 22
great 0 27 22
difficulties.’” 0 27 22

In 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
recent 0 27 23
interview 0 27 23
(http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
Italian 0 27 23
philosopher, 0 27 23
Rocco 0 27 23
Buttiglione, 0 27 23
provides 0 27 23
this 0 27 23
example 0 27 23
for 0 27 23
AL 0 27 23
303: 0 27 23
“Imagine 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
father 0 27 23
who 0 27 23
has 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
sick 0 27 23
son 0 27 23
and 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
child 0 27 23
improves. 0 27 23

He 0 27 24
still 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
fever 0 27 24
but 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
stopped 0 27 24
vomiting; 0 27 24
the 0 27 24
child 0 27 24
manages 0 27 24
to 0 27 24
keep 0 27 24
in 0 27 24
his 0 27 24
stomach 0 27 24
what 0 27 24
he 0 27 24
eats 0 27 24
and 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
started 0 27 24
a 0 27 24
therapy 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
seems 0 27 24

to 0 27 25
work. 0 27 25
The 0 27 25
father 0 27 25
is 0 27 25

happy. 0 27 26
Is 0 27 26
he 0 27 26
happy 0 27 26
about 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
fact 0 27 26
that 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
child 0 27 26

is 0 27 27
sick? 0 27 27
No, 0 27 27
he 0 27 27
is 0 27 27
pleased 0 27 27
that 0 27 27
his 0 27 27
son 0 27 27
gives 0 27 27
symptoms 0 27 27
of 0 27 27
improvement 0 27 27
and 0 27 27
healing.” 0 27 27

This 0 27 28
is 0 27 28
what 0 27 28
Pope 0 27 28
Francis 0 27 28
is 0 27 28
saying 0 27 28
in 0 27 28

God 0 27 29

with 0 27 29
the 0 27 29
command 0 27 29
of 0 27 29

Gospel. 0 27 30
God, 0 27 30
however, 0 27 30
is 0 27 30
happy 0 27 30
when 0 27 30
people 0 27 30
in 0 27 30
such 0 27 30
situations 0 27 30
discern 0 27 30
in 0 27 30
conscience 0 27 30
that 0 27 30
He 0 27 30
is 0 27 30
asking 0 27 30
them 0 27 30
to 0 27 30
make 0 27 30
a 0 27 30
choice 0 27 30
that 0 27 30
moves 0 27 30
in 0 27 30
the 0 27 30
right 0 27 30
direction—even 0 27 30
if 0 27 30
they 0 27 30
still 0 27 30
need 0 27 30
to 0 27 30
progress 0 27 30
further 0 27 30
toward 0 27 30
a 0 27 30
more 0 27 30
complete 0 27 30
fulfillment 0 27 30
of 0 27 30

His 0 27 31

This 0 27 31
is 0 27 31
the 0 27 31

if 1 27 37
the 1 27 37
moral 1 27 37
norm 1 27 37
is 1 27 37
not 1 27 37
adhered 1 27 37

is 1 27 37

sophistical. 1 27 38
What 0 27 38
constitutes 0 27 38
a 0 27 38
“move 0 27 38

from 0 27 38
sin 0 27 38
if 0 27 38
not 0 27 38
ceasing 0 27 38
to 0 27 38
commit 0 27 38

the 0 27 39
sin? 0 27 39
No 0 27 39
example 0 27 39
is 0 27 39
provided 0 27 39
in 0 27 39
AL 0 27 39
because 0 27 39

none 0 27 40
can 0 27 40
be. 0 27 40
The 0 27 40
notion 0 27 40
is 0 27 40

nonsensical. 0 27 41
Just 0 27 41
how 0 27 41
nonsensical 0 27 41
is 0 27 41
demonstrated 0 27 41
by 0 27 41
Dr. 0 27 41
Fastiggi’s 0 27 41
claim 0 27 41
that 0 27 41
by 0 27 41
“a 0 27 41
move 0 27 41
away 0 27 41
from 0 27 41
sin” 0 27 41
in 0 27 41
the 0 27 41
case 0 27 41
of 0 27 41
a 0 27 41
divorced 0 27 41
and 0 27 41
“remarried” 0 27 41
couple 0 27 41
Francis 0 27 41
means 0 27 41
their 0 27 41
agreement 0 27 41
to 0 27 41
live 0 27 41
in 0 27 41
continence 0 27 41
as 0 27 41
brother 0 27 41
and 0 27 41
sister 0 27 41
for 0 27 41
the 0 27 41
sake 0 27 41

of 0 27 42
children. 0 27 42
But 0 27 42
that 0 27 42
would 0 27 42
be 0 27 42
ceasing 0 27 42
to 0 27 42
commit 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
sin 0 27 42
of 0 27 42
adultery 0 27 42
altogether 0 27 42
as 0 27 42
it 0 27 42
would 0 27 42
involve 0 27 42
abandoning 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
pretense 0 27 42
that 0 27 42
they 0 27 42
are 0 27 42
married 0 27 42
along 0 27 42
with 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
illicit 0 27 42
sexual 0 27 42
relation 0 27 42

itself. 0 27 43
Such 0 27 43
a 0 27 43
couple 0 27 43
could 0 27 43
always 0 27 43
be 0 27 43
absolved 0 27 43
and 0 27 43
receive 0 27 43
Holy 0 27 43
Communion 0 27 43
under 0 27 43
the 0 27 43
Church’s 0 27 43
constant 0 27 43
practice, 0 27 43
albeit 0 27 43
privately 0 27 43
to 0 27 43
avoid 0 27 43

scandal. 0 27 44
At 0 27 44
any 0 27 44
rate, 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
“brother 0 27 44
and 0 27 44
sister” 0 27 44
approach 0 27 44
to 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
situation, 0 27 44
which 0 27 44
is 0 27 44
that 0 27 44
of 0 27 44
Familiaris 0 27 44
consortio 0 27 44
84, 0 27 44
is 0 27 44
certainly 0 27 44
not 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
one 0 27 44
advocated 0 27 44

by 0 27 45
Francis. 0 27 45
As 0 27 45
my 0 27 45
article 0 27 45
shows, 0 27 45
Francis 0 27 45
has 0 27 45
made 0 27 45
it 0 27 45
quite 0 27 45
clear 0 27 45
that 0 27 45
he 0 27 45
approves 0 27 45
of 0 27 45
admitting 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
the 0 27 45
sacraments 0 27 45
divorced 0 27 45
and 0 27 45
“remarried” 0 27 45
people 0 27 45
who 0 27 45
will 0 27 45
continue 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
live 0 27 45
as 0 27 45
if 0 27 45
they 0 27 45
were 0 27 45
married, 0 27 45
including 0 27 45
sexual 0 27 45
relations, 0 27 45
while 0 27 45
“discerning” 0 27 45
their 0 27 45
situation, 0 27 45
this 0 27 45
“discernment” 0 27 45
being 0 27 45
a 0 27 45
mere 0 27 45
fig 0 27 45
leaf 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
conceal 0 27 45
the 0 27 45
proposed 0 27 45
toleration 0 27 45
of 0 27 45
public 0 27 45
adultery 0 27 45
in 0 27 45

the 0 27 46
Church. 0 27 46
Thus, 0 27 46
Francis 0 27 46
thanked 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
Maltese 0 27 46
bishops 0 27 46
for 0 27 46
their 0 27 46
AL 0 27 46
guidelines, 0 27 46
which 0 27 46
literally 0 27 46
mandate 0 27 46
admission 0 27 46
to 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
sacraments 0 27 46
of 0 27 46
divorced 0 27 46
and 0 27 46
“remarried” 0 27 46
people 0 27 46
who 0 27 46
believe 0 27 46
themselves 0 27 46
to 0 27 46
be 0 27 46
“at 0 27 46
peace 0 27 46
with 0 27 46
God.” 0 27 46
And, 0 27 46
as 0 27 46
he 0 27 46
told 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
bishops 0 27 46
of 0 27 46
Buenos 0 27 46
Aires 0 27 46
in 0 27 46

“there 0 27 46

no 0 27 46

No 0 27 47
amount 0 27 47
of 0 27 47
verbal 0 27 47
artifice 0 27 47
can 0 27 47

what 0 27 47
is 0 27 47
happening 0 27 47
in 0 27 47
the 0 27 47

without 0 27 47
an 0 27 47
amendment 0 27 47

the 0 27 47
Church---which 0 27 47
John 0 27 47
Paul 0 27 47
insisted 0 27 47
involves 0 27 47
a 0 27 47
moral 0 27 47
norm, 0 27 47
not 0 27 47
a 0 27 47
mere 0 27 47

after 0 27 48
place. 0 27 48
It 0 27 48
is 0 27 48
a 0 27 48
great 0 27 48
disservice 0 27 48
to 0 27 48
the 0 27 48
Church 0 27 48
to 0 27 48
maintain 0 27 48

that 0 27 48

nothing 0 27 48

about 0 27 49

This 0 27 64
could 0 27 64
reasonably 0 27 64

Pope 0 27 66

the 0 27 66
exposition 0 27 66
of 0 27 66
Amoris 0 27 66
laetitia 0 27 66
by 0 27 66
Cardinal 0 27 66
Schoenborn 0 27 66
given 0 27 66
in 0 27 66
April 0 27 66
2016 0 27 66
when 0 27 66
the 0 27 66
exhortation 0 27 66

was 0 27 67
made 0 27 67
public. 0 27 67
I 1 27 67
have 1 27 67
read 1 27 67
the 1 27 67
Cardinal's 1 27 67
exposition 1 27 67
in 1 27 67
both 1 27 67
Italian 1 27 67
and 1 27 67
English, 1 27 67
and 1 27 67
I 1 27 67
only 1 27 67
find 1 27 67
mention 1 27 67
of 1 27 67
the 1 27 67
help 1 27 67
of 1 27 67
the 1 27 67
sacraments 1 27 67

in 1 27 68
certain 1 27 68
cases. 1 27 68
Once 0 27 68
again, 0 27 68
Mr. 0 27 68
Ferrara 0 27 68
assumes 0 27 68
this 0 27 68
means 0 27 68
access 0 27 68
to 0 27 68
Holy 0 27 68
Communion 0 27 68
without 0 27 68
prior 0 27 68

sacramental 0 27 69
confession. 0 27 69
With 0 27 69
regard 0 27 69
to 0 27 69
the 0 27 69
letter 0 27 69
thanking 0 27 69
the 0 27 69
Bishops 0 27 69
of 0 27 69
Malta, 0 27 69
it 0 27 69
should 0 27 69
be 0 27 69
noted 0 27 69
that 0 27 69
Edward 0 27 69
Pentin 0 27 69
mentions 0 27 69
a 0 27 69
letter 0 27 69
of 0 27 69
Cardinal 0 27 69
Baldiserri 0 27 69
not 0 27 69

a 0 27 70
letter 0 27 70
of 0 27 70
Pope 0 27 70
Francis. 0 27 70
Moreover, 0 27 70
this 0 27 70
letter 0 27 70
has 0 27 70
not 0 27 70
been 0 27 70
made 0 27 70
public 0 27 70
so 0 27 70
we 0 27 70
don't 0 27 70
know 0 27 70
exactly 0 27 70
what 0 27 70
it 0 27 70
says 0 27 70
other 0 27 70
than 0 27 70

an 0 27 71
expression 0 27 71
of 0 27 71
thanks. 0 27 71
This 0 27 71
seems 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
be 0 27 71
very 0 27 71
thin 0 27 71
evidence 0 27 71
for 0 27 71
claiming 0 27 71
Pope 0 27 71
Francis 0 27 71
wishes 0 27 71
the 0 27 71
bishops 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
admit 0 27 71
public 0 27 71
adulterers 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
the 0 27 71
sacraments 0 27 71
while 0 27 71
continuing 0 27 71
in 0 27 71
their 0 27 71

adulterous 0 27 72
relations. 0 27 72
As 0 27 72
a 0 27 72
lawyer, 0 27 72
Ferrara 0 27 72
should 0 27 72
have 0 27 72
a 0 27 72
better 0 27 72
sense 0 27 72
of 0 27 72
what 0 27 72

really 0 27 73
counts 0 27 73
as 0 27 73
evidence. 0 27 73
As 0 27 73
a 0 27 73
Christian, 0 27 73
he 0 27 73
should 0 27 73
also 0 27 73
be 0 27 73
mindful 0 27 73
of 0 27 73
the 0 27 73
command 0 27 73
against 0 27 73

bearing 0 27 74
false 0 27 74
witness. 0 27 74
Beyond 0 27 74
these 0 27 74
considerations, 0 27 74
I 0 27 74
wish 0 27 74
to 0 27 74
express 0 27 74
a 0 27 74
personal 0 27 74
concern 0 27 74
I 0 27 74
have 0 27 74
about 0 27 74
Mr. 0 27 74
Ferrara's 0 27 74
standing 0 27 74

in 0 27 75
the 0 27 75
Catholic 0 27 75
Church. 0 27 75
He 0 27 75
says 0 27 75
that 0 27 75
Dr. 0 27 75
Goldstein 0 27 75
and 0 27 75
I 0 27 75
are 0 27 75
“foot 1 27 75
soldiers 1 27 75
of 1 27 75
a 1 27 75
Leviathan 1 27 75
Church” 1 27 75
because 0 27 75
we 0 27 75

defend 0 27 76
the 0 27 76
Roman 0 27 76
Pontiff. 0 27 76
Does 1 27 76
Mr. 1 27 76
Ferrara 1 27 76
believe 1 27 76
that 1 27 76
the 1 27 76
Catholic 1 27 76
Church 1 27 76
under 1 27 76
Pope 1 27 76
Francis 1 27 76
is 1 27 76
a 1 27 76
“Leviathan 1 27 76
Church” 1 27 76
and 1 27 76

not 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
Catholic 1 27 77
Church? 1 27 77
If 1 27 77
this 1 27 77
is 1 27 77
so, 1 27 77
then 1 27 77
it 1 27 77
would 1 27 77
suggest 1 27 77
that 1 27 77
Mr. 1 27 77
Ferrara 1 27 77
is 1 27 77
refusing 1 27 77
submission 1 27 77
to 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
Roman 1 27 77
Pontiff 1 27 77
and 1 27 77
communion 1 27 77
with 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
members 1 27 77
of 1 27 77

the 1 27 78
Church 1 27 78
subject 1 27 78
to 1 27 78
him. 1 27 78
This, 0 27 78
though, 0 27 78
is 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
very 0 27 78
definition 0 27 78
of 0 27 78
schism 0 27 78
found 0 27 78
in 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
Catechism 0 27 78
of 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
Catholic 0 27 78
Church, 0 27 78
2089 0 27 78

and 0 27 79
the 0 27 79
1983 0 27 79
CIC 0 27 79
canon 0 27 79
751. 0 27 79
I 0 27 79
hope 0 27 79
Mr. 0 27 79
Ferrara 0 27 79
can 0 27 79
clarify 0 27 79
what 0 27 79
he 0 27 79
means 0 27 79
by 0 27 79
the 0 27 79
“Leviathan 0 27 79

Church” 0 27 80
under 0 27 80
Pope 0 27 80
Francis. 0 27 80
A 0 27 80
more 0 27 80
simple 0 27 80
question 0 27 80
to 0 27 80
him 0 27 80
would 0 27 80
be 0 27 80
this: 0 27 80
“Are 0 27 80
you 0 27 80
refusing 0 27 80
submission 0 27 80
to 0 27 80
the 0 27 80
Roman 0 27 80
Pontiff 0 27 80
or 0 27 80
communion 0 27 80
with 0 27 80
the 0 27 80

members 0 27 81
subject 0 27 81
to 0 27 81
him?” 0 27 81
I 0 27 81
apologize 0 27 81
ahead 0 27 81
of 0 27 81
time 0 27 81

if 0 27 82
I 0 27 82
misconstrued 0 27 82
his 0 27 82
words. 0 27 82
I 0 27 82
believe, 0 27 82
though, 0 27 82
my 0 27 82
question 0 27 82
is 0 27 82
reasonable 0 27 82
in 0 27 82
light 0 27 82
of 0 27 82
his 0 27 82
reference 0 27 82
to 0 27 82
a 0 27 82
“Leviathan 0 27 82
Church” 0 27 82
distinct 0 27 82
from 0 27 82
“the 0 27 82
dictates 0 27 82
of 0 27 82

the 0 27 83

Dr. 0 27 84

a 0 27 84
growing 0 27 84
mountain 0 27 84
of 0 27 84
evidence, 0 27 84
that 0 27 84

has 0 27 84
not 0 27 84
in 0 27 84

of 0 27 84

when 0 27 84
Archbishop 0 27 84
of 0 27 84

just 0 27 84
as 0 27 84
he 0 27 84
did 0 27 84
with 0 27 84
the 0 27 84
woman 0 27 84
he 0 27 84
telephoned 0 27 84
in 0 27 84

I 0 27 85
cannot 0 27 85
help 0 27 85
him. 0 27 85
As 0 27 85
for 0 27 85
my 0 27 85
metaphorical 0 27 85

a 0 27 85
“Leviathan 0 27 85

I 0 27 85
am 0 27 85
afraid 0 27 85
Dr. 1 27 85
Fastiggi 1 27 85
has 1 27 85
succumbed 1 27 85
to 1 27 85
an 1 27 85

unfortunate 1 27 86
literal-mindedness. 1 27 86
To 0 27 86
make 0 27 86
it 0 27 86
clear 0 27 86
for 0 27 86
him, 0 27 86
I 0 27 86
am 0 27 86
contending 0 27 86
that 0 27 86
he 0 27 86
and 0 27 86
his 0 27 86
co-author 0 27 86
treat 0 27 86
the 0 27 86
Pope 0 27 86
as 0 27 86
if 0 27 86
he 0 27 86

the 0 27 86
absolute 0 27 86

ruler 0 27 87
of 0 27 87

I 0 27 87
do 0 27 87
not, 0 27 87
as 0 27 87
should 0 27 87
be 0 27 87
obvious, 0 27 87
argue 0 27 87
that 0 27 87
this 0 27 87
Leviathan 0 27 87

Church 0 27 88
actually 0 27 88
exists. 0 27 88
That 0 27 88
it 0 27 88

not 0 27 88
and 0 27 88
cannot 0 27 88

exist 0 27 89

“standing 0 27 89

objections 0 27 90

has 0 27 90
not, 0 27 90
at 0 27 90
any 0 27 90
rate, 0 27 90

plague 0 44 1
that’s 0 44 1

124 0 44 1

now 0 44 1
blamed 0 44 1
on 0 44 1
“dancing 1 44 1
with 1 44 1
corpses.” 1 44 1
This 0 44 1
is 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
time 0 44 1
of 0 44 1
year 0 44 1
when 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
dead 0 44 1
are 0 44 1
wrapped 0 44 1
in 0 44 1
sheets 0 44 1

paraded 0 44 1
through 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
streets 0 44 1
while 0 44 1
others 0 44 1
dance 0 44 1
around 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
bodies. 0 44 1

The 1 44 2
local 1 44 2
tradition 1 44 2
is 1 44 2
said 1 44 2
to 1 44 2
be 1 44 2
one 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
the 1 44 2
major 1 44 2
causes 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
the 1 44 2
spread 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
this 1 44 2
disease. 1 44 2

Since 0 44 3
it’s 0 44 3
airborne, 0 44 3
anyone 0 44 3
coming 0 44 3
close 0 44 3
to 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
corpse 0 44 3
of 0 44 3
a 0 44 3
person 0 44 3
who 0 44 3
has 0 44 3
died 0 44 3
of 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
black 0 44 3
death 0 44 3
could 0 44 3
themselves, 0 44 3
catch 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
infection. 0 44 3

Health 1 44 4
officials 1 44 4
suspect 1 44 4
it’s 1 44 4
no 1 44 4
coincidence 1 44 4
that 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
outbreak 1 44 4
coincides 1 44 4
with 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
time 1 44 4

The 0 45 13
fact 0 45 13
is 0 45 13
that 0 45 13
the 0 45 13
CIA 0 45 13
put 0 45 13
in 0 45 13
its 0 45 13

But 0 45 14
“Art 1 45 14
of 1 45 14

Trump 1 45 14
obviously 1 45 14
sat 1 45 14
on 1 45 14
the 1 45 14
request, 1 45 14
undoubtedly 1 45 14
hoping 1 45 14
that 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
could 1 45 14
get 1 45 14
what 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
wanted 1 45 14
in 1 45 14

if 1 45 14
he 1 45 14
just 1 45 14
continued 1 45 14
holding 1 45 14
out 1 45 14
and 1 45 14
conveying 1 45 14
that 1 45 14
he 1 45 14

ready 1 45 14
to 1 45 14

Don’t 0 45 15
forget: 0 45 15
According 0 45 15
to 0 45 15
Trump’s 0 45 15
own 0 45 15

he 0 45 15
had 0 45 15
already 0 45 15
ostensibly 0 45 15
decided 0 45 15
to 0 45 15

So 1 45 17
interesting! 1 45 17

Now, 0 45 18
it’s 0 45 18
theoretically 0 45 18
possible 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
the 0 45 18
CIA 0 45 18
presented 0 45 18
Trump 0 45 18
with 1 45 18
some 1 45 18
earthshattering 1 45 18
new 1 45 18
information 1 45 18
on 0 45 18
the 0 45 18
Thursday 0 45 18
deadline 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
showed 0 45 18
that 0 45 18
the 1 45 18
United 1 45 18
States 1 45 18
would 1 45 18
fall 1 45 18
into 1 45 18
the 1 45 18
ocean 1 45 18
if 1 45 18
Americans 1 45 18
were 1 45 18
finally 1 45 18
permitted 1 45 18
to 1 45 18

the 1 45 18
CIA’s 1 45 18
long-secret 1 45 18
JFK 0 45 18

But 1 45 19
how 1 45 19
likely 1 45 19
is 1 45 19
that? 1 45 19

Not 0 45 20
likely 0 45 20
at 0 45 20
all! 0 45 20

Instead, 0 45 21
it 1 45 21
is 1 45 21
a 1 45 21
virtual 1 45 21
certainly 1 45 21
that 1 45 21
when 1 45 21
Art 1 45 21
of 1 45 21
the 1 45 21

out 1 45 21
those 1 45 21
two 1 45 21
tweets, 1 45 21
he 1 45 21
was 1 45 21
sending 1 45 21
a 1 45 21

to 1 45 21

knew 0 45 24
it 0 45 24
would. 0 45 24

Contrary 0 45 25
to 0 45 25
what 0 45 25
the 0 45 25
mainstream 0 45 25
press 0 45 25
is 0 45 25
asserting, 0 45 25
the 1 45 25
records 1 45 25
undoubtedly 1 45 25
contain 1 45 25
more 1 45 25
incriminating 1 45 25
circumstantial 1 45 25
evidence 1 45 25
that 1 45 25
fills 1 45 25
in 1 45 25
the 1 45 25
mosaic 1 45 25
of 1 45 25
a 1 45 25
U.S. 1 45 25
national-security 1 45 25
regime-change 1 45 25
operation 1 45 25
on 1 45 25
November 1 45 25
22, 1 45 25
1963. 1 45 25

That’s 0 45 26
what 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
mainstream 0 45 26
media, 0 45 26
forever 0 45 26
wedded 0 45 26
to 0 45 26
the 0 45 26
official 0 45 26
story 0 45 26
no 0 45 26
matter 0 45 26
how 0 45 26
ridiculous 1 45 26
and 1 45 26
illogical 1 45 26
it 0 45 26
is, 0 45 26
simply 0 45 26
cannot 0 45 26
bring 0 45 26
themselves 0 45 26
to 0 45 26
confront. 0 45 26

Trump 0 45 27
knew 0 45 27
that 0 45 27
he 0 45 27
had 0 45 27
the 0 45 27
CIA 0 45 27
over 0 45 27
a 0 45 27
barrel. 0 45 27

As 0 45 28
I 0 45 28
indicated 0 45 28
in 0 45 28
my 0 45 28
two 0 45 28
articles 0 45 28
this 0 45 28
week, 0 45 28
the 0 45 28
CIA 0 45 28
was 0 45 28
between 0 45 28
a 0 45 28
rock 0 45 28
and 0 45 28
a 0 45 28
hard 0 45 28
place. 0 45 28

On 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
one 0 45 29
hand, 0 45 29
it 0 45 29
could 0 45 29
refuse 0 45 29
to 0 45 29
grant 0 45 29
Trump 0 45 29
what 0 45 29
he 0 45 29
wanted 0 45 29
and 0 45 29
let 0 45 29
the 0 45 29
records 0 45 29
be 0 45 29
released, 0 45 29
which 0 45 29
it 1 45 29
knew 1 45 29
would 1 45 29
point 1 45 29
to 1 45 29
the 1 45 29
CIA’s 1 45 29
guilt 1 45 29
in 1 45 29
the 1 45 29
assassination. 1 45 29

On 0 45 30
the 0 45 30
other 0 45 30
hand, 0 45 30
it 0 45 30
could 0 45 30
give 0 45 30
Trump 0 45 30
what 0 45 30
he 0 45 30
wanted 0 45 30
and 0 45 30
have 0 45 30
to 0 45 30
suffer 0 45 30
the 1 45 30
obvious 1 45 30
inference 1 45 30
that 1 45 30
people 1 45 30
would 1 45 30
draw 1 45 30
— 1 45 30
that 1 45 30
the 1 45 30
CIA 1 45 30
was 1 45 30
continuing 1 45 30
to 1 45 30
cover 1 45 30
up 1 45 30
incriminatory 1 45 30
evidence. 1 45 30

What 0 45 31
did 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
CIA 0 45 31
give 0 45 31
Trump 0 45 31
in 0 45 31
return 0 45 31
for 0 45 31
Trump’s 0 45 31
extending 0 45 31
the 0 45 31
CIA’s 0 45 31
50-year-plus 0 45 31
secrecy? 0 45 31

We 0 45 32
don’t 0 45 32
know, 0 45 32
but 0 45 32
my 0 45 32
hunch 0 45 32
is 0 45 32
that 0 45 32
it 0 45 32
pertains 0 45 32
to 0 45 32
Russia. 0 45 32

Here’s 0 45 33
my 0 45 33
next 0 45 33
prediction: 0 45 33
the 0 45 33
congressional 0 45 33
investigations 0 45 33
into 0 45 33
Trump’s 0 45 33
supposed 0 45 33
“collusion” 0 45 33
with 0 45 33
Russia 0 45 33
are 0 45 33
about 0 45 33
to 0 45 33
fizzle 0 45 33
out. 0 45 33

That’s 0 45 34
because 0 45 34
I 0 45 34
believe 0 45 34
that 0 45 34
the 0 45 34
CIA, 0 45 34
as 0 45 34
part 0 45 34
of 0 45 34
its 0 45 34
deal 0 45 34
with 0 45 34
Trump, 0 45 34
will 0 45 34
order 0 45 34
its 0 45 34
assets 0 45 34
in 0 45 34
Congress 0 45 34
to 0 45 34
cease 0 45 34
and 0 45 34
desist 0 45 34
with 0 45 34
respect 0 45 34
to 0 45 34
that 0 45 34
investigation. 0 45 34

In 0 45 35
my 0 45 35
opinion, 0 45 35
that’s 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
price 0 45 35
the 0 45 35
CIA 0 45 35
had 0 45 35
to 0 45 35
pay 0 45 35
in 0 45 35
return 0 45 35
for 0 45 35
its 0 45 35
continued 0 45 35
cover-up 0 45 35
of 0 45 35
its 0 45 35
U.S. 0 45 35
regime-change 0 45 35
operation 0 45 35
in 0 45 35
November 0 45 35
1963. 0 45 35

Notice 0 45 36
something 0 45 36
else 0 45 36
about 0 45 36
the 0 45 36
deal 0 45 36
that 0 45 36
Trump 0 45 36
has 0 45 36
presumably 0 45 36
made 0 45 36
with 0 45 36
the 0 45 36
CIA: 0 45 36
The 0 45 36
secrecy 0 45 36
arrangement 0 45 36
extends 0 45 36
only 0 45 36
to 0 45 36
April. 0 45 36

Ostensibly, 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
next 0 45 37
six 0 45 37
months 0 45 37
are 0 45 37
needed 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
carefully 0 45 37
review 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
records 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
determine 0 45 37
whether 0 45 37
the 0 45 37
records 0 45 37
really 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
relate 0 45 37
to 0 45 37
“national 0 45 37
security.” 0 45 37
Regime 0 45 37
Change: 0 45 37

JFK... 0 45 37

Not 0 45 38
surprisingly, 0 45 38
the 0 45 38
mainstream 0 45 38
media 0 45 38
isn’t 1 45 38
even 1 45 38
questioning 1 45 38
that 1 45 38
ludicrous 1 45 38
notion. 1 45 38

For 0 45 39
more 0 45 39
than 0 45 39
50 0 45 39
years, 0 45 39
the 0 45 39
CIA 0 45 39
has 0 45 39
known 0 45 39
why 0 45 39
it 0 45 39
has 0 45 39
wanted 0 45 39
those 0 45 39
particular 0 45 39
records 0 45 39
to 0 45 39
be 0 45 39
kept 0 45 39
secret. 0 45 39

During 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
term 0 45 40
of 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
Assassination 0 45 40
Records 0 45 40
Review 0 45 40
Board 0 45 40
in 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
1990s, 0 45 40
the 0 45 40
CIA 0 45 40
decided 0 45 40
to 0 45 40
keep 0 45 40
these 0 45 40
particular 0 45 40
records 0 45 40
secret 0 45 40
for 0 45 40
another 0 45 40
25 0 45 40
years. 0 45 40

There 0 45 41
are 0 45 41
bound 0 45 41
to 0 45 41
be 0 45 41
lots 0 45 41
of 0 45 41
CIA 0 45 41
memoranda 0 45 41
detailing 0 45 41
why 0 45 41
it 0 45 41
was 0 45 41
imperative 0 45 41
to 0 45 41
keep 0 45 41
these 0 45 41
particular 0 45 41
records 0 45 41
secret 0 45 41
for 0 45 41
as 0 45 41
long 0 45 41
as 0 45 41
possible. 0 45 41

Finally, 0 45 42
the 0 45 42
CIA 0 45 42
made 0 45 42
its 0 45 42
request 0 45 42
for 0 45 42
secrecy 0 45 42
to 0 45 42
Trump 0 45 42
at 0 45 42
least 0 45 42
several 0 45 42
weeks 0 45 42
ago. 0 45 42

The 0 45 43
notion 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
CIA 0 45 43
suddenly 0 45 43
hit 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
yesterday 0 45 43
with 0 45 43
a 0 45 43
new 0 45 43
argument 0 45 43
as 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
why 0 45 43
“national 0 45 43
security” 0 45 43
would 0 45 43
be 0 45 43
threatened, 0 45 43
after 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
had 0 45 43
supposedly 0 45 43
already 0 45 43
rejected 0 45 43
the 0 45 43
arguments 0 45 43
that 0 45 43
had 0 45 43
been 0 45 43
presented 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
him, 0 45 43
causing 0 45 43
Trump 0 45 43
to 0 45 43
suddenly 0 45 43
change 0 45 43
his 0 45 43
mind, 0 45 43
is, 1 45 43
well, 1 45 43
laughable. 1 45 43

So, 0 45 44
why 0 45 44
the 0 45 44
April 0 45 44
deadline? 0 45 44

Why 0 45 45
not 0 45 45
extend 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
secrecy 0 45 45
for 0 45 45
another 0 45 45
25 0 45 45
years, 0 45 45
which 0 45 45
is 0 45 45
undoubtedly 0 45 45
what 0 45 45
the 0 45 45
CIA 0 45 45
wanted? 0 45 45

Because 0 45 46
Trump 0 45 46
obviously 0 45 46
needed 0 45 46
collateral 0 45 46
to 0 45 46
ensure 0 45 46
that 0 45 46
the 0 45 46
CIA 0 45 46
complied 0 45 46
with 0 45 46
its 0 45 46
part 0 45 46
of 0 45 46
the 0 45 46
deal. 0 45 46

If 0 45 47
Trump 0 45 47
had 0 45 47
extended 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
secrecy 0 45 47
for 0 45 47
25 0 45 47
years, 0 45 47
he 0 45 47
would 0 45 47
have 0 45 47
lost 0 45 47
leverage 0 45 47
to 0 45 47
ensure 0 45 47
that 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
CIA 0 45 47
complied 0 45 47
with 0 45 47
its 0 45 47
part 0 45 47
of 0 45 47
the 0 45 47
bargain. 0 45 47

Let’s 0 45 48
say, 0 45 48
hypothetically, 0 45 48
that 0 45 48
I’m 0 45 48
right: 0 45 48
that 0 45 48
the 0 45 48
CIA 0 45 48
agreed 0 45 48
to 0 45 48
use 0 45 48
its 0 45 48
assets 0 45 48
in 0 45 48
Congress 0 45 48
to 0 45 48
shut 0 45 48
down 0 45 48
the 0 45 48
Russia 0 45 48
investigation. 0 45 48

To 0 45 49
make 0 45 49
certain 0 45 49
that 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
CIA 0 45 49
fulfills 0 45 49
its 0 45 49
part 0 45 49
of 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
bargain, 0 45 49
Trump 0 45 49
would 0 45 49
need 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
April 0 45 49
deadline 0 45 49
so 0 45 49
that 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
threat 0 45 49
of 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
records 0 45 49
release 0 45 49
would 0 45 49
continue 0 45 49
hanging 0 45 49
over 0 45 49
the 0 45 49
CIA. 0 45 49

If 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
CIA 0 45 50
fails 0 45 50
to 0 45 50
fulfill 0 45 50
its 0 45 50
part 0 45 50
of 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
bargain, 0 45 50
Trump 0 45 50
releases 0 45 50
the 0 45 50
records 0 45 50
in 0 45 50
April. 0 45 50

If 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
CIA 0 45 51
squelches 0 45 51
the 0 45 51
Russia 0 45 51
investigations, 0 45 51
Trump 0 45 51
grants 0 45 51
another 0 45 51
extension 0 45 51
of 0 45 51
time 0 45 51
in 0 45 51
April. 0 45 51

Let’s 1 45 52
state 1 45 52
the 1 45 52
obvious: 1 45 52
The 1 45 52
CIA 1 45 52
records 1 45 52
that 1 45 52
are 1 45 52
still 1 45 52
being 1 45 52
suppressed 1 45 52
have 1 45 52
nothing 1 45 52
to 1 45 52
do 1 45 52
with 1 45 52
“national 1 45 52
security.” 1 45 52
They 1 45 52
have 1 45 52
everything 1 45 52
to 1 45 52
do 1 45 52
with 1 45 52
covering 1 45 52
up 1 45 52
the 1 45 52
CIA’s 1 45 52
role 1 45 52
in 0 45 52
the 0 45 52
U.S. 0 45 52
national-security 0 45 52
regime-change 0 45 52
operation 0 45 52
that 0 45 52
took 0 45 52
place 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
Dallas 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
November 0 45 52
1963, 0 45 52
which 0 45 52
succeeded 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
ousting 0 45 52
from 0 45 52
power 0 45 52
a 0 45 52
president 0 45 52
who 0 45 52
was, 0 45 52
in 0 45 52
the 0 45 52
eyes 0 45 52
of 0 45 52
the 0 45 52
U.S. 0 45 52

establishment, 0 45 52

that 0 45 53
constituted 0 45 53
a 1 45 53
grave 1 45 53
threat 1 45 53
to 1 45 53
“national 1 45 53
security,” 1 45 53
i.e., 1 45 53
befriending 1 45 53
the 1 45 53
Russians 1 45 53
(i.e., 1 45 53
the 1 45 53
Soviets) 1 45 53
and 1 45 53
Cubans 1 45 53
and 1 45 53
entering 1 45 53
into 1 45 53
peaceful 1 45 53
coexistence 1 45 53
with 1 45 53
the 1 45 53
communist 1 45 53
world. 1 45 53

In 0 45 54
other 0 45 54
words, 0 45 54
unlike 0 45 54
Lee 0 45 54
Harvey 0 45 54

Kennedy, 1 45 54
the 0 45 54

Immediately 0 45 56
upon 0 45 56
the 0 45 56
arrest 0 45 56
of 0 45 56
Lee 0 45 56
Harvey 0 45 56
Oswald, 0 45 56
the 0 45 56
official 0 45 56
account 0 45 56
was 0 45 56
that 0 45 56
this 0 45 56
was 0 45 56
just 0 45 56
a 1 45 56
lone 1 45 56
nut, 1 45 56
former 1 45 56
U.S. 1 45 56

who 0 45 56
decided, 0 45 56

no 0 45 56
apparent 0 45 56
reason, 0 45 56
to 0 45 56
assassinate 0 45 56
Kennedy. 0 45 56

One 0 45 57
big 0 45 57
problem 0 45 57
is 0 45 57
the 0 45 57
official 0 45 57
story, 0 45 57
however, 0 45 57
requires 0 45 57
a 0 45 57
suspension 1 45 57
of 1 45 57
logic 1 45 57
and 1 45 57
common 1 45 57
sense. 1 45 57

For 0 45 58
anyone 0 45 58
who 0 45 58
has 0 45 58
a 0 45 58
mindset 0 45 58
of 0 45 58
conformity 0 45 58
and 0 45 58
deference 0 45 58
to 0 45 58
authority, 0 45 58
that 0 45 58
story 0 45 58
makes 0 45 58
sense 0 45 58
because 0 45 58
nothing 0 45 58
is 0 45 58
questioned 0 45 58
or 0 45 58
challenged. 0 45 58

For 1 45 59
anyone 1 45 59
who 1 45 59
has 1 45 59
a 1 45 59
critical, 1 45 59
analytical, 1 45 59
independent 1 45 59
mindset, 1 45 59
the 1 45 59
official 1 45 59
story 1 45 59
is 1 45 59
filled 1 45 59
with 1 45 59
holes. 1 45 59

For 0 45 60
example, 0 45 60
how 0 45 60
many 0 45 60
communist 0 45 60
Marines 0 45 60
have 0 45 60
you 0 45 60
ever 0 45 60
heard 0 45 60
of? 0 45 60

Why 0 45 61
would 0 45 61
a 0 45 61
genuine 0 45 61
communist 0 45 61
join 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
Marines 0 45 61
in 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
first 0 45 61
place, 0 45 61
especially 0 45 61
since 0 45 61
the 0 45 61
Marines 0 45 61
had 0 45 61
just 0 45 61
recently 0 45 61
killed 0 45 61
millions 0 45 61
of 0 45 61
North 0 45 61
Korean 0 45 61
communists? 0 45 61

Why 0 45 62
would 0 45 62
a 0 45 62
genuine 0 45 62
communist 0 45 62
join 0 45 62
the 0 45 62
Marines 0 45 62
knowing 0 45 62
that 0 45 62
he 0 45 62
could 0 45 62
be 0 45 62
called 0 45 62
upon 0 45 62
at 0 45 62
any 0 45 62
moment 0 45 62
to 0 45 62
go 0 45 62
to 0 45 62
Korea, 0 45 62
Laos, 0 45 62
Vietnam, 0 45 62
Europe, 0 45 62
or 0 45 62
elsewhere 0 45 62
to 0 45 62
kill 0 45 62
fellow 0 45 62
communists? 0 45 62

How 0 45 63
many 0 45 63
communists 0 45 63
do 0 45 63
you 0 45 63
know 0 45 63
who 0 45 63
like 0 45 63
to 0 45 63
kill 0 45 63
fellow 0 45 63

Think 0 45 68
about 0 45 68
how 0 45 68
the 0 45 68
U.S. 0 45 68
national-security 0 45 68

treats 0 45 68
what 0 45 68
it 0 45 68
suspects 0 45 68
are 0 45 68
communists 0 45 68
or 0 45 68
traitors. 0 45 68

It 1 45 69
skewers 1 45 69
them. 1 45 69

Why, 0 45 70
just 0 45 70
look 0 45 70
at 0 45 70
how 0 45 70
they 1 45 70
call 1 45 70
Julian 1 45 70
Assange 1 45 70
a 1 45 70
traitor 1 45 70
and 0 45 70
he 0 45 70
isn’t 0 45 70
even 0 45 70
an 0 45 70
American. 0 45 70

Recall 0 45 71
the 0 45 71
McCarthy 0 45 71

Dalton 0 45 72
Trumbo. 0 45 72

The 0 45 73
entire 0 45 73
U.S. 0 45 73
anti-communist 0 45 73
crusade, 0 45 73
including 0 45 73
Vietnam, 0 45 73
which 0 45 73
more 0 45 73
than 0 45 73
58,000 0 45 73
U.S. 0 45 73
soldiers 0 45 73
died 0 45 73
killing 0 45 73
communists. 0 45 73

And 0 45 74
they’re 0 45 74
going 0 45 74
to 0 45 74
tell 0 45 74
us 0 45 74
that 0 45 74
they 0 45 74
just 0 45 74
let 0 45 74
Lee 0 45 74
Harvey 0 45 74
Oswald, 0 45 74
a 0 45 74
supposed 0 45 74
self-avowed 1 45 74
communist 1 45 74
skate 1 45 74
blissfully 1 45 74
across 1 45 74
the 1 45 74
Cold 1 45 74
War 1 45 74
stage 1 45 74
of 1 45 74
history 1 45 74
with 1 45 74
nary 1 45 74
any 1 45 74
abuse 1 45 74
or 1 45 74
harassment 1 45 74
at 1 45 74
all? 1 45 74

Don’t 1 45 75
make 1 45 75
me 1 45 75
laugh. 1 45 75

Soon 0 45 76
after 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
Warren 0 45 76
Commission 0 45 76
was 0 45 76
established, 0 45 76
Warren 0 45 76
called 0 45 76
a 0 45 76
super-secret 0 45 76
meeting 0 45 76
of 0 45 76
the 0 45 76
commission 0 45 76
to 0 45 76
address 0 45 76
information 0 45 76
that 0 45 76
had 0 45 76
come 0 45 76
into 0 45 76
Warren’s 0 45 76
possession. 0 45 76

That 0 45 77
information 0 45 77
was 0 45 77
that 0 45 77
Oswald 0 45 77
was 0 45 77
actually 0 45 77
working 0 45 77
for 0 45 77
U.S. 0 45 77
intelligence. 0 45 77

Yes, 0 45 78
a 0 45 78
spy, 0 45 78
the 0 45 78
type 0 45 78
of 0 45 78
people 0 45 78
that 0 45 78
work 0 45 78
for 0 45 78
the 0 45 78
CIA. 0 45 78

That 0 45 79
would 0 45 79
make 0 45 79
sense, 0 45 79
especially 0 45 79
given 0 45 79
that 0 45 79
the 0 45 79
Marine 0 45 79
Corps 0 45 79
is 0 45 79
a 0 45 79
prime 0 45 79
recruiting 0 45 79
place 0 45 79
for 0 45 79
the 0 45 79
CIA. 0 45 79

Semper 0 45 80
fidelis! 0 45 80

Now, 0 45 81
suddenly, 0 45 81
all 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
circumstantial 0 45 81
evidence 0 45 81
in 0 45 81
the 0 45 81
Kennedy 0 45 81
assassination 0 45 81
falls 0 45 81
into 0 45 81
place. 0 45 81

It 0 45 82
begins 0 45 82
to 0 45 82
make 0 45 82
sense. 0 45 82

The 0 45 83
mosaic 0 45 83
starts 0 45 83
to 0 45 83
be 0 45 83
filled 0 45 83
out: 0 45 83
They 1 45 83
needed 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
get 1 45 83
rid 1 45 83
of 1 45 83
Kennedy 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
protect 1 45 83
national 1 45 83
security 1 45 83
and 1 45 83
elevate 1 45 83
Johnson, 1 45 83
who 1 45 83
had 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
same 1 45 83
anti-communist 1 45 83
mindset 1 45 83
as 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
Pentagon 1 45 83
and 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
CIA, 1 45 83
to 1 45 83
the 1 45 83
presidency. 1 45 83

Unlike 0 45 84
JFK, 0 45 84
who 0 45 84
had 0 45 84
begun 0 45 84
withdrawing 0 45 84
troops 0 45 84
from 0 45 84
Vietnam, 0 45 84
Johnson 0 45 84

protect 0 45 85
national 0 45 85
security 0 45 85
by 0 45 85
sending 0 45 85
more 0 45 85
troops 0 45 85
to 0 45 85
Vietnam. 0 45 85

But 0 45 86
to 0 45 86
avoid 0 45 86
detection, 0 45 86
they 0 45 86
needed 0 45 86
a 0 45 86
patsy, 0 45 86
which 0 45 86
is 0 45 86
the 0 45 86
term 0 45 86
that 0 45 86
Oswald 0 45 86
used 0 45 86
after 0 45 86
his 0 45 86
arrest. 0 45 86

They 0 45 87
needed 0 45 87
to 0 45 87
frame 0 45 87
someone 0 45 87
for 0 45 87
the 0 45 87
crime. 0 45 87

And 0 45 88
what 0 45 88
better 0 45 88
person 0 45 88
to 0 45 88
frame 0 45 88
than 0 45 88
a 0 45 88
communist 0 45 88
or 0 45 88
an 0 45 88
intelligence 0 45 88
agent 0 45 88
who 0 45 88
the 0 45 88
public 0 45 88
would 0 45 88
believe 0 45 88
was 0 45 88
a 0 45 88
communist? 0 45 88

Part 0 45 89
of 0 45 89
the 0 45 89
scheme, 0 45 89
obviously, 0 45 89
would 0 45 89
be 0 45 89
to 0 45 89
establish 0 45 89
Oswald’s 0 45 89
communist 0 45 89
bona 0 45 89
fides. 0 45 89

That’s 0 45 90
why 0 45 90
he 0 45 90
was 0 45 90
sent 0 45 90
to 0 45 90
New 0 45 90
Orleans, 0 45 90
where, 0 45 90
contradictorily, 0 45 90
he 0 45 90
would 0 45 90
work 0 45 90
for 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
right-wing 0 45 90
business 0 45 90
owner, 0 45 90
work 0 45 90
with 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
right-wing 0 45 90
former 0 45 90
FBI 0 45 90
agent, 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
conduct 0 45 90
a 0 45 90
public 0 45 90
protest 0 45 90
in 0 45 90
favor 0 45 90
of 0 45 90
Fidel 0 45 90
Castro 0 45 90
and 0 45 90
Cuba. 0 45 90

It 0 45 91
was 0 45 91
also 0 45 91
why 0 45 91
he 0 45 91
was 0 45 91
sent 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
Mexico 0 45 91
City, 0 45 91
where 0 45 91
he 0 45 91
would 0 45 91
be 0 45 91
ordered 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
visit 0 45 91
the 0 45 91
Cuban 0 45 91

no 1 45 91
doubt 1 45 91
being 1 45 91
told 1 45 91
that 1 45 91
he 1 45 91
was 1 45 91
being 1 45 91
prepared 1 45 91
for 1 45 91
an 1 45 91
important 1 45 91
mission, 1 45 91
maybe 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
enter 0 45 91
Cuba 0 45 91
to 0 45 91
assassinate 0 45 91
Castro. 0 45 91

But 0 45 92
no 1 45 92
government 1 45 92
operation 1 45 92
ever 1 45 92
goes 1 45 92
perfectly. 1 45 92

Things 0 45 93
obviously 0 45 93
went 0 45 93
dreadfully 1 45 93
wrong 1 45 93
with 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
Mexico 0 45 93
City 0 45 93
operation 0 45 93
because 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
investigation 0 45 93
into 0 45 93
it 0 45 93
after 0 45 93
the 0 45 93
assassination 0 45 93
was 0 45 93
quickly 0 45 93
shut 0 45 93
down. 0 45 93

Today, 0 45 94
it 0 45 94
remains 0 45 94
shrouded 1 45 94
in 1 45 94
mystery. 1 45 94

And 0 45 95
guess 0 45 95
what 0 45 95
is 0 45 95
included 0 45 95
in 0 45 95
the 0 45 95
records 0 45 95
that 0 45 95
Trump 0 45 95
has 0 45 95
now 0 45 95
agreed 0 45 95
to 0 45 95
continue 0 45 95
suppressing. 0 45 95

You 0 45 96
guessed 0 45 96
it! 0 45 96

The 0 45 97
CIA’s 0 45 97
records 0 45 97
relating 0 45 97
to 0 45 97
Mexico 0 45 97
City! 0 45 97

Ever 0 45 98
since 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
assassination, 0 45 98
the 1 45 98
CIA 1 45 98
has 1 45 98
argued 1 45 98
that 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
release 1 45 98
of 1 45 98
any 1 45 98
of 1 45 98
its 1 45 98
JFK 1 45 98
records 1 45 98
would 1 45 98
threaten 1 45 98
“national 1 45 98
security.” 1 45 98
One 0 45 98
thing 0 45 98
is 0 45 98
for 0 45 98
sure 0 45 98
and 0 45 98
undeniable: 0 45 98
Despite 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
release 0 45 98
of 0 45 98
many 0 45 98
of 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
CIA’s 0 45 98
records 0 45 98
in 0 45 98
the 0 45 98
1990s 0 45 98
and 0 45 98
yesterday, 0 45 98
the 1 45 98
United 1 45 98
States 1 45 98
did 1 45 98
not 1 45 98
fall 1 45 98
into 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
ocean 1 45 98
or 1 45 98
fall 1 45 98
to 1 45 98
the 1 45 98
communists. 1 45 98

And 0 45 99
neither 0 45 99
would 0 45 99
it 0 45 99
have 0 45 99
done 0 45 99
so 0 45 99
if 0 45 99
Trump 0 45 99
had 0 45 99
not 0 45 99
granted 0 45 99
the 0 45 99
CIA’s 0 45 99
request 0 45 99

had 1 55 4
prior 1 55 4

This 0 55 5
is 0 55 5
the 0 55 5
atmosphere 0 55 5
that 0 55 5
Jewish 0 55 5
students 0 55 5

on 0 55 5
a 0 55 5
daily 0 55 5
basis 0 55 5
at 0 55 5
McGill. 0 55 5

The 1 55 6
toxic 1 55 6
environment 1 55 6
is 0 55 6
due 0 55 6
almost 0 55 6
exclusively 0 55 6
to 0 55 6
an 0 55 6
active 0 55 6
and 0 55 6
vocal 0 55 6
presence 0 55 6
of 0 55 6
BDS 1 55 6
agitators 1 55 6
on 0 55 6
campus. 0 55 6

Lew 0 55 7
followed 0 55 7
the 0 55 7
advice 0 55 7
and 0 55 7
was 0 55 7
elected 0 55 7
as 0 55 7
a 0 55 7
board 0 55 7
member. 0 55 7

His 0 55 8
“secret” 0 55 8
was 0 55 8
intact. 0 55 8

BDS 1 55 9
provocateurs 1 55 9
at 0 55 9
McGill 0 55 9
had 0 55 9
relentlessly 0 55 9
tried 0 55 9
and 0 55 9
failed 0 55 9
to 0 55 9
pass 0 55 9
boycott 0 55 9

Finally, 0 55 11
in 0 55 11
June 0 55 11
2016, 0 55 11
SSMU’s 0 55 11
Judicial 0 55 11
Board 0 55 11
ruled 0 55 11
that 0 55 11

ruling, 0 55 12
which 0 55 12
is 0 55 12
called 0 55 12
a 0 55 12
“reference,” 0 55 12

referred 0 55 12
to 0 55 12
SSMU’s 0 55 12

addressed 0 55 13
the 0 55 13
issue 0 55 13
more 0 55 13
than 0 55 13
a 0 55 13

after 0 55 13
the 0 55 13

Lew 0 55 13
and 0 55 13
other 0 55 13
board 0 55 13
members 0 55 13
passionately 1 55 13
advocated 1 55 13
in 0 55 13
favor 0 55 13
of 0 55 13
ratification 0 55 13
and 0 55 13
their 0 55 13
arguments 0 55 13
ultimately 0 55 13
prevailed 0 55 13
over 0 55 13
the 0 55 13
naysayers. 0 55 13

The 1 55 14
malevolent 1 55 14
BDS 1 55 14
campaign 1 55 14
at 0 55 14
McGill 0 55 14
had 0 55 14
belatedly 0 55 14
come 0 55 14
to 0 55 14
an 0 55 14
ignominious 1 55 14
end; 1 55 14
or 0 55 14
so 0 55 14
we 0 55 14
thought. 0 55 14

Lew 0 55 15
and 0 55 15
two 0 55 15
other 0 55 15

as 0 55 15
either 0 55 15
Jewish 0 55 15
or 0 55 15
pro-Israel 0 55 15
became 0 55 15
instant 0 55 15
targets 0 55 15
of 0 55 15
a 1 55 15
campaign 1 55 15
of 1 55 15
hate 1 55 15
laced 1 55 15
with 1 55 15
blatant 1 55 15
anti-Semitic 1 55 15
overtones. 1 55 15

Campus 0 55 16
BDS 0 55 16
groups 0 55 16
held 0 55 16
several 0 55 16
meetings 0 55 16
to 0 55 16
formulate 0 55 16
a 0 55 16
response 0 55 16
and 0 55 16
founded 0 55 16
the 0 55 16
so-called 0 55 16
“Democratize 0 55 16

movement. 0 55 16

But 1 55 17
Democratize 1 55 17
SSMU 1 55 17
was 1 55 17
anything 1 55 17
but 1 55 17
democratic. 1 55 17

Its 0 55 18
raison 0 55 18

It 0 55 20
does 0 55 20
not 0 55 20

that 0 55 20
his 0 55 20

An 1 55 23
enlightened, 1 55 23

was 1 55 23
suddenly 1 55 23
transformed 1 55 23

In 0 55 24
October, 0 55 24
SSMU’s 0 55 24

“historically, 0 55 25

rather 0 55 25

a 0 55 25

the 0 55 25

this 0 55 26
manner, 0 55 26
BDS/ 0 55 26
Democratize 0 55 26
SSMU 0 55 26

to 0 55 26
pick 0 55 26
off 0 55 26
their 0 55 26
opponents 0 55 26
one 0 55 26
at 0 55 26
a 0 55 26
time. 0 55 26

It 0 55 27
was 0 55 27
repulsive 1 55 27
display 1 55 27
leftist-fascist 1 55 27
bigotry 1 55 27
at 1 55 27
its 1 55 27
worst. 1 55 27

The 1 55 28
bigoted 1 55 28
BDS 1 55 28
provocateurs 1 55 28
applauded 0 55 28
as 0 55 28
Lew 0 55 28
and 0 55 28
the 0 55 28
other 0 55 28
two 0 55 28
board 0 55 28
members 0 55 28
were 0 55 28
removed 0 55 28
from 0 55 28
their 0 55 28
posts. 0 55 28

But 0 55 29
this 0 55 29
time, 0 55 29
they 0 55 29
may 0 55 29
have 0 55 29
gone 0 55 29
too 0 55 29
far. 0 55 29

Even 0 55 30
by 0 55 30
BDS 0 55 30
standards, 0 55 30
their 1 55 30
manifestly 1 55 30
anti-Semitic 1 55 30
campaign 1 55 30
antics 1 55 30
were 1 55 30
beyond 1 55 30
the 1 55 30
pale. 1 55 30

BDS 0 55 31
activists 0 55 31
generally 0 55 31
avoid 0 55 31
reference 0 55 31
to 0 55 31
“Jews” 0 55 31
by 0 55 31
name 0 55 31
because 0 55 31
it 0 55 31
is 0 55 31
impolitic 0 55 31
and 0 55 31
commonly 0 55 31
substitute 0 55 31
“Zionists” 0 55 31
for 0 55 31
Jews 0 55 31
even 0 55 31
though 0 55 31
most 0 55 31
of 0 55 31
us 0 55 31
are 0 55 31
cognizant 0 55 31
of 0 55 31
their 0 55 31
true 0 55 31
intentions. 0 55 31

But 0 55 32
in 0 55 32
the 0 55 32
instant 0 55 32
case, 0 55 32
McGill’s 0 55 32
BDS 0 55 32
campaigners 0 55 32
dispensed 0 55 32
with 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
traditional 0 55 32
charade 1 55 32
and 0 55 32
overtly 0 55 32
launched 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
attack 0 55 32
against 0 55 32
Jews. 0 55 32

The 1 55 33
vitriolic 1 55 33
BDS 1 55 33
campaign 1 55 33
immediately 0 55 33
sparked 1 55 33
outrage 1 55 33
among 0 55 33
watchdog 0 55 33
groups 0 55 33
and 0 55 33
politicians 0 55 33
prompting 0 55 33
McGill 0 55 33
principal, 0 55 33
Suzanne 0 55 33
Fortier, 0 55 33
to 0 55 33
announce 0 55 33
that 0 55 33
the 0 55 33
school 0 55 33
would 0 55 33
be 0 55 33
conducting 0 55 33
an 0 55 33
investigation 0 55 33
into 0 55 33
the 0 55 33
matter. 0 55 33

Even 0 55 34
SSMU 0 55 34
president, 0 55 34
Muna 0 55 34
Tojiboeva, 0 55 34
voiced 0 55 34
support 0 55 34
for 0 55 34
Lew 0 55 34
and 0 55 34
expressed 0 55 34
the 0 55 34
belief 0 55 34
that 0 55 34
antisemitism 0 55 34
played 0 55 34
a 0 55 34
key 0 55 34
role 0 55 34
in 0 55 34
the 0 55 34
ousting 0 55 34
the 0 55 34
three 0 55 34

One 0 55 35
can 0 55 35
only 0 55 35
hope 0 55 35
that 0 55 35
Fortier 0 55 35
takes 0 55 35
the 0 55 35
issue 0 55 35
seriously 0 55 35
and 0 55 35
conducts 0 55 35
a 0 55 35
proper 0 55 35
investigation, 0 55 35
which 0 55 35
leads 0 55 35
to 0 55 35

derided 0 86 1
by 0 86 1

But 0 86 2
these 0 86 2

never 0 86 2
demonstrate 0 86 2
that 0 86 2
the 0 86 2
oft-cited 0 86 2
quotations 0 86 2
are 0 86 2
apocryphal; 0 86 2
they 0 86 2
merely 0 86 2
assert 0 86 2
that 0 86 2
they 0 86 2
must 0 86 2
be, 0 86 2
as 0 86 2
they 0 86 2
seem 0 86 2

destroy 1 86 7
the 1 86 7

the 1 86 7

reject 1 86 7

A 0 86 8
day 0 86 8
will 0 86 8
come 0 86 8
when 0 86 8
the 0 86 8
civilized 0 86 8

will 0 86 8
deny 0 86 8
its 0 86 8
God, 0 86 8
when 0 86 8
the 0 86 8
Church 0 86 8
will 0 86 8
doubt 0 86 8
as 0 86 8
Peter 0 86 8
doubted. 0 86 8

She 0 86 9
will 0 86 9
be 0 86 9
tempted 0 86 9
to 0 86 9
believe 0 86 9
that 0 86 9
man 0 86 9
has 0 86 9
become 0 86 9
God. 0 86 9

In 0 86 10
our 0 86 10
churches, 0 86 10
Christians 1 86 10
will 1 86 10
search 1 86 10
in 1 86 10
vain 1 86 10

the 1 86 10

lamp 1 86 10
where 1 86 10
God 1 86 10
awaits 1 86 10
them. 1 86 10

Like 1 86 11
Mary 1 86 11

weeping 1 86 11
before 1 86 11
the 1 86 11
empty 1 86 11

they 0 86 11
will 0 86 11
ask, 0 86 11
“Where 0 86 11

demanded 0 86 12

because 0 86 12

His 0 86 19
attempt 0 86 19
to 0 86 19
debunk 0 86 19
the 0 86 19

nit-picking 0 86 19
about 0 86 19
what 1 86 19

But 1 86 20
he 1 86 20
had 1 86 20
no 1 86 20

that 1 86 20
the 1 86 20

Amazingly, 1 87 5
the 0 87 5
surveillance 0 87 5

captured 0 87 5
what 0 87 5
seems 0 87 5

The 0 87 9

goes 0 87 9
how 0 87 9
to 0 87 9
show 0 87 9
two 0 87 9

too 0 87 9
late. 0 87 9

Ambellas 0 87 10
also 0 87 10
reported 0 87 10
on 0 87 10
what 0 87 10
his 0 87 10
research 0 87 10
indicates 0 87 10

documented 0 87 10

the 0 87 10

at 0 87 10
the 0 87 10
time. 0 87 10

A 0 87 11
quick 0 87 11
review 0 87 11
of 0 87 11
flight 0 87 11
records 0 87 11
during 0 87 11
that 0 87 11
time 0 87 11
reveals 0 87 11
that 0 87 11
a 0 87 11
squadron 0 87 11
of 0 87 11
EC-130 0 87 11
Eurocopters 0 87 11
departed 0 87 11
from 0 87 11

at 0 87 11
10:12 0 87 11
p.m., 0 87 11
several 0 87 11

which 0 87 11
appear 0 87 11
to 0 87 11
have 0 87 11
overflown 0 87 11
the 0 87 11

the 0 87 11

and 0 87 11
debris 0 87 11
were 0 87 11
seen. 0 87 11

However, 0 87 12
the 0 87 12
departure 0 87 12
of 0 87 12
the 0 87 12
choppers 0 87 12

the 0 87 12
fact 0 87 12
that 0 87 12
several 0 87 12

them 0 87 12
overflew 0 87 12
the 0 87 12
parking 0 87 12
lot 0 87 12
does 0 87 12
not 0 87 12
explain 0 87 12
all 0 87 12
of 0 87 12
the 0 87 12
debris 0 87 12
being 0 87 12

up 0 87 12

possibly 0 87 12

hovering 0 87 12
in 0 87 12
place 0 87 12
much 0 87 12
closer. 0 87 12

In 0 87 13
fact, 0 87 13
the 0 87 13
downdraft 0 87 13
appears 0 87 13
to 0 87 13
be 0 87 13
constant 0 87 13
from 0 87 13
10:13-10:16 0 87 13
p.m. 0 87 13
and 0 87 13
not 0 87 13
intermittent 0 87 13
as 0 87 13
if 0 87 13
several 0 87 13
choppers 0 87 13
had 0 87 13
just 0 87 13
passed 0 87 13
overhead. 0 87 13

As 0 87 14
I 0 87 14
have 0 87 14
reported 0 87 14
in 0 87 14

the 0 87 16

It 0 87 17
is 0 87 17
also 0 87 17
important 0 87 17
to 0 87 17

Haig 0 129 17

Wednesday 0 129 18

The 0 129 20
ammunition 0 129 20

place 0 129 20
at 0 129 20
Haig's 0 129 20
home 0 129 20
in 0 129 20
Mesa, 0 129 20
because 0 129 20
he 0 129 20
didn't 0 129 20

the 0 129 20

at 0 129 20
the 0 129 20
gun 0 129 20
show. 0 129 20

Victor 0 129 21
said 0 129 21
a 0 129 21
box 0 129 21
that 0 129 21
Paddock 0 129 21
used 0 129 21

ammunition 0 129 21
out 0 129 21
of 0 129 21

launched. 0 129 21

It's 0 129 22
unknown 0 129 22
whether 0 129 22
the 0 129 22
ammunition 0 129 22
Haig 0 129 22
sold 0 129 22
to 0 129 22
Paddock 0 129 22
was 0 129 22
used 0 129 22
in 0 129 22
the 0 129 22
attack. 0 129 22

The 0 129 23

and 0 129 23
quantity 0 129 23
of 0 129 23

Paddock 0 129 23
bought 0 129 23
from 0 129 23
his 0 129 23
client 0 129 23
wasn't 0 129 23
unusual. 0 129 23

Catechism 1 146 8
of 1 146 8
the 1 146 8
Catholic 1 146 8

teaches 1 146 8
that 1 146 8
“under 1 146 8

can 1 146 8
homosexual 1 146 8
activity 1 146 8
“be 1 146 8
approved” 1 146 8
as 1 146 8
it 1 146 8
is 1 146 8
“intrinsically 1 146 8
disordered.” 1 146 8
Such 1 146 8
acts 1 146 8
are 1 146 8
“contrary 1 146 8
to 1 146 8
the 1 146 8
natural 1 146 8
law. 1 146 8

They 1 146 9
close 1 146 9
the 1 146 9
sexual 1 146 9
act 1 146 9
to 1 146 9
the 1 146 9
gift 1 146 9
of 1 146 9
life. 1 146 9

They 1 146 10
do 1 146 10
not 1 146 10
proceed 1 146 10
from 1 146 10
a 1 146 10
genuine 1 146 10

sexual 1 146 10
complementarity” 1 146 10
(CCC 1 146 10

However, 0 146 11
Marx 0 146 11
said 0 146 11
on 0 146 11
February 0 146 11
3 0 146 11
that 0 146 11
homosexual 0 146 11

“closer 0 146 11
pastoral 0 146 11

and 0 146 11
“one 0 146 11
must 0 146 11

[of 0 146 11

encouragement. 0 146 11

I 1 146 12
do 1 146 12
not 1 146 12
really 1 146 12
see 1 146 12
any 1 146 12
problems 1 146 12
there.” 1 146 12

Marx 0 146 13
is 0 146 13
the 0 146 13
President 0 146 13
of 0 146 13

As 0 146 14
LifeSiteNews 0 146 14
previously 0 146 14
reported, 0 146 14
Marx 0 146 14
also 0 146 14
said 0 146 14
“yes,” 0 146 14
he 0 146 14
could 0 146 14
imagine 0 146 14
the 0 146 14
creation 0 146 14
of 0 146 14
a 0 146 14
rite 0 146 14
for 0 146 14
homosexual 0 146 14
couples 0 146 14
to 0 146 14
be 0 146 14
blessed 0 146 14
in 0 146 14
the 0 146 14
Church. 0 146 14

This 0 146 15
“encouragement” 0 146 15
from 0 146 15
priests 0 146 15
which 0 146 15
he 0 146 15
called 0 146 15
for 0 146 15
might 0 146 15
include 0 146 15
some 0 146 15
sort 0 146 15
of 0 146 15
“liturgical” 0 146 15
recognition 0 146 15
of 0 146 15
their 0 146 15
union. 0 146 15

But 0 146 16
“how 0 146 16
this 0 146 16
would 0 146 16
be 0 146 16
done 0 146 16
publicly, 0 146 16
in 0 146 16
a 0 146 16
liturgical 0 146 16
form,” 0 146 16
is 0 146 16
“another 0 146 16
question...that 0 146 16
is 0 146 16
where 0 146 16
one 0 146 16
has 0 146 16
to 0 146 16
be 0 146 16
reticent 0 146 16
and 0 146 16
also 0 146 16
reflect 0 146 16
upon 0 146 16
that 0 146 16

more 0 146 19

without 0 146 19

However, 0 146 19
the 0 146 19
German 0 146 19
Bishops’ 0 146 19

the 0 146 19
rest 0 146 19
of 0 146 19

solar 0 150 4
minimums 0 150 4

combing 0 150 7
the 0 150 7
data, 0 150 7
Lubin’s 0 150 7
team 0 150 7
has 0 150 7
forecasted 0 150 7
a 0 150 7
grand 0 150 7
minimum 0 150 7
that 0 150 7
will 0 150 7
be 0 150 7
around 0 150 7
seven 0 150 7
percent 0 150 7
cooler 0 150 7
than 0 150 7
the 0 150 7
typical 0 150 7
solar 0 150 7
minimum, 0 150 7
making 0 150 7
it 0 150 7
a 0 150 7
particularly 0 150 7
calm 0 150 7
moment 0 150 7
for 0 150 7
our 0 150 7
star. 0 150 7

During 0 150 8
a 0 150 8
solar 0 150 8
minimum, 0 150 8
the 0 150 8
Sun 0 150 8
produces 0 150 8
far 0 150 8
fewer 0 150 8
solar 0 150 8
flares 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
sunspots, 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
as 0 150 8
a 0 150 8
result, 0 150 8
much 0 150 8
less 0 150 8
ultraviolet 0 150 8

is 0 150 8
shot 0 150 8
out 0 150 8
into 0 150 8
space 0 150 8
and 0 150 8
towards 0 150 8
Earth. 0 150 8

This 0 150 9
can 0 150 9
have 0 150 9
a 0 150 9
number 0 150 9
of 0 150 9
effects 0 150 9
on 0 150 9
our 0 150 9
planet, 0 150 9
including 0 150 9
changes 0 150 9
in 0 150 9
the 0 150 9
thickness 0 150 9
of 0 150 9
the 0 150 9
stratospheric 0 150 9
ozone 0 150 9
layer 0 150 9
and 0 150 9
temperatures 0 150 9
far 0 150 9
above 0 150 9
ground. 0 150 9

Those 0 150 10
changes 0 150 10
can 0 150 10
affect 0 150 10
weather, 0 150 10
though 0 150 10
forecasting 0 150 10
specific 0 150 10
differences 0 150 10
has 0 150 10
proven 0 150 10
difficult. 0 150 10

The 0 150 11
grand 0 150 11
minimum 0 150 11
will 0 150 11
be 0 150 11
an 0 150 11
exaggerated 0 150 11
version 0 150 11
of 0 150 11
the 0 150 11
typical 0 150 11
solar 0 150 11
minimum, 0 150 11
and 0 150 11

Saviano 0 174 19
said 0 174 19
the 0 174 19
commission 0 174 19
is 0 174 19
“a 0 174 19
good 0 174 19
idea,” 0 174 19
and 0 174 19

“I’m 0 174 19

a 0 174 19

“That’s 0 174 21
kind 0 174 21
of 0 174 21
my 0 174 21
attitude 0 174 21
now: 0 174 21

Church 1 174 21
to 1 174 21

“My 0 174 27

probably 0 174 27
have 0 174 27
the 0 174 27

because 0 174 27
the 0 174 27
church 0 174 27

the 0 174 27

they 0 174 27
do 0 174 27
it 0 174 27

seen 1 174 28
little 1 174 28
that 1 174 28

Scanlan 0 174 29

Pope 0 174 29

but 0 174 29
on 0 174 29
sexual 0 174 29

he 0 174 29
“continues 1 174 29
to 1 174 29

“This 0 69 8

which 0 69 11
has 0 69 11
been 0 69 11

Orbán 0 69 12
and 0 69 12
Soros 0 69 12
have 0 69 12
a 0 69 12
history, 0 69 12
beginning 0 69 12
in 0 69 12

and 0 69 12
ending 0 69 12
in 0 69 12
acrimony. 0 69 12

Orbán 0 69 13
started 0 69 13
public 0 69 13
life 0 69 13
as 0 69 13
a 0 69 13
crusader 0 69 13

Soros, 0 69 14
who 0 69 14
expatriated 0 69 14
from 0 69 14
Hungary, 0 69 14
also 0 69 14

But 0 69 15
Orbán’s 0 69 15
defense 0 69 15
of 0 69 15
conservative 0 69 15
values 0 69 15
has 0 69 15
led 0 69 15
to 0 69 15
breaking 0 69 15

with 0 69 15
Soros, 0 69 15
whom 0 69 15
he 0 69 15
now 0 69 15
criticizes 0 69 15

After 0 69 16

report 0 69 16
said, 0 69 16
“Orbán 0 69 16
has 0 69 16
conflated 0 69 16
the 0 69 16

continued: 0 69 17

Soros, 0 69 18
for 0 69 18
his 0 69 18
part, 0 69 18
compared 1 69 18
Orbán 1 69 18
unfavourably 1 69 18
to 1 69 18
both 1 69 18
the 1 69 18
Nazis 1 69 18
and 1 69 18
the 1 69 18
Communists, 1 69 18
saying 0 69 18
his 0 69 18
rule 0 69 18
evoked 0 69 18
dark 0 69 18
tones 0 69 18
from 0 69 18
the 0 69 18
1930's, 0 69 18
when 0 69 18
Hungary 0 69 18
was 0 69 18
allied 0 69 18
with 0 69 18
Nazi 0 69 18
Germany. 0 69 18

But 0 69 19
Orbán 0 69 19
remains 0 69 19
committed 0 69 19
to 0 69 19
his 0 69 19
policy, 0 69 19
claiming 0 69 19
that 0 69 19
Soros 0 69 19
and 0 69 19
supporters 0 69 19
of 0 69 19
migration 0 69 19
are 0 69 19
losing 0 69 19
the 0 69 19
fight. 0 69 19

He 0 69 20
said: 0 69 20
“Soros 0 69 20
has 0 69 20
antagonised 0 69 20
not 0 69 20
only 0 69 20
us 0 69 20
but 0 69 20
also 0 69 20
England, 0 69 20
President 0 69 20

and 0 69 20
Israel 0 69 20
too. 0 69 20

Everywhere 0 69 21
he 0 69 21
wants 0 69 21
to 0 69 21
get 0 69 21
migration 0 69 21
accepted. 0 69 21

It 0 69 22
won't 0 69 22
work. 0 69 22

We 0 69 23
are 0 69 23
not 0 69 23
alone 0 69 23
and 0 69 23
we 0 69 23
will 0 69 23
fight 0 69 23
together 0 69 23

purportedly 0 69 24
discriminating 0 69 24

what 0 196 4
has 0 196 4
appeared 0 196 4
for 0 196 4

This 0 196 9
is 0 196 9

another 0 196 9
big 0 196 9
shake-up 0 196 9
for 0 196 9
Trump’s 0 196 9
still-young 0 196 9

it 0 196 9

to 0 196 9
date. 0 196 9

The 0 196 10
move 0 196 10
creates 0 196 10
some 0 196 10
big 0 196 10
questions 0 196 10
about 0 196 10
both 0 196 10
the 0 196 10
administration’s 0 196 10
foreign 0 196 10

the 0 196 10
president’s 0 196 10
relationship 0 196 10
with 0 196 10
the 0 196 10
deep 0 196 10
state. 0 196 10

“I 0 196 11
will 0 196 11
oppose 0 196 11
both 0 196 11

Haspel’s 0 196 11
nomination,” 0 196 11
Paul 0 196 11

Wednesday. 0 196 11

The 0 196 12
Kentucky 0 196 12

is 0 196 12
the 0 196 12
first 0 196 12

say 0 196 12
he 0 196 12
will 0 196 12
attempt 0 196 12
to 0 196 12
block 0 196 12
the 0 196 12

but 0 196 12
he 0 196 12
isn’t 0 196 12
the 0 196 12
first 0 196 12

Sen. 0 196 13
John 0 196 13
McCain 0 196 13
of 0 196 13
Arizona 0 196 13
said 0 196 13
Tuesday 0 196 13
that 0 196 13
he 0 196 13
wanted 0 196 13
answers 0 196 13
about 0 196 13
Haspel’s 0 196 13
background 0 196 13
running 0 196 13
CIA 0 196 13

prior 0 196 13
to 0 196 13
her 0 196 13
confirmation. 0 196 13

Paul 0 196 14
contends 0 196 14
that 0 196 14
the 0 196 14
Trump 0 196 14
nominations 0 196 14
directly 0 196 14
contradict 0 196 14
promises 0 196 14
the 0 196 14
president 0 196 14
made 0 196 14
on 0 196 14
the 0 196 14
campaign 0 196 14
trail. 0 196 14

“I’m 0 196 15
perplexed 1 196 15
by 1 196 15
the 0 196 15
nomination 0 196 15

people 0 196 15
who 0 196 15
love 1 196 15
the 1 196 15
Iraq 1 196 15
War 1 196 15
so 0 196 15
much 0 196 15
that 0 196 15
they 0 196 15
would 0 196 15
advocate 0 196 15
for 0 196 15
a 0 196 15
war 0 196 15
with 0 196 15
Iran 0 196 15
next. 0 196 15

I 0 196 16
think 0 196 16
it 0 196 16
goes 0 196 16
against 0 196 16
most 0 196 16
of 0 196 16
the 0 196 16
things 0 196 16
President 0 196 16
Trump 0 196 16
campaigned 0 196 16
on,” 0 196 16
he 0 196 16
said. 0 196 16

The 0 196 17
lawmaker 0 196 17
added 0 196 17
that 0 196 17
he 0 196 17
can’t 0 196 17
support 0 196 17
Haspel, 0 196 17
whom 0 196 17
he 0 196 17
described 0 196 17
as 0 196 17
having 0 196 17
expressed 0 196 17
“joyful 1 196 17
glee” 1 196 17
at 0 196 17
being 0 196 17

the 0 196 17
past. 0 196 17

“I 0 196 18
find 1 196 18
it 1 196 18
just 1 196 18
amazing 1 196 18
that 1 196 18
anyone 1 196 18

After 0 205 2

all 0 205 2
the 0 205 2
evidence 0 205 2
closely, 0 205 2

have 0 205 2

And 0 205 3
that 0 205 3
in 0 205 3
a 0 205 3
nutshell 0 205 3
shows 0 205 3
what’s 0 205 3
wrong 0 205 3
with 0 205 3
today’s 0 205 3
FBI. 0 205 3

Sean 0 205 4

FBI 0 205 4
special 0 205 4
agent 0 205 4
in 0 205 4
charge 0 205 4
of 0 205 4
the 0 205 4
Sacramento 0 205 4
field 0 205 4
office, 0 205 4
stated: 0 205 4
“We 0 205 4
don’t 0 205 4
have 0 205 4
any 0 205 4

of 0 205 4
terrorism 0 205 4
at 0 205 4
this 0 205 4
point. 0 205 4

Now 0 205 5
the 0 205 5
question 0 205 5
is, 0 205 5
why. 0 205 5

Why 0 205 6
was 0 205 6
he 0 205 6
there? 0 205 6

What 0 205 7
led 0 205 7
him 0 205 7
there? 0 205 7

And 0 205 8
we 0 205 8
don’t 0 205 8

Ragan 0 205 9
said.” 0 205 9

Yes, 0 205 10
what 0 205 10
Kazi 0 205 10
could 0 205 10
possibly 0 205 10
have 0 205 10
been 0 205 10
up 0 205 10
to 0 205 10
is 0 205 10
a 0 205 10
complete 0 205 10
mystery. 0 205 10

The 0 205 11
Times 0 205 11
added 0 205 11
that 0 205 11
“the 0 205 11
dead 0 205 11
man’s 0 205 11
religious 0 205 11

not 0 205 11

point, 0 205 11
said 0 205 11
Ragan, 0 205 11
who 0 205 11
debunked 0 205 11
a 0 205 11
rumor 0 205 11
that 0 205 11
some 0 205 11
sort 0 205 11
of 0 205 11
‘jihad’ 0 205 11
video 0 205 11
was 0 205 11
found 0 205 11
on 0 205 11
Kazi’s 0 205 11
phone.” 0 205 11

All 0 205 12
right. 0 205 12

No 0 205 13
jihad 0 205 13
video. 0 205 13

And 0 205 14
no 0 205 14
“nexus 0 205 14
of 0 205 14
terrorism,” 0 205 14
according 0 205 14
to 0 205 14
Sean 0 205 14
Ragan. 0 205 14

What 0 205 15
is 0 205 15
a 0 205 15
nexus 0 205 15
of 0 205 15
terrorism? 0 205 15

Ragan 1 205 16
most 1 205 16
likely 1 205 16
means 1 205 16
that 1 205 16
investigators 1 205 16
didn’t 1 205 16
find 1 205 16
an 1 205 16
ISIS 1 205 16
membership 1 205 16
card 1 205 16
in 1 205 16
Kazi’s 1 205 16
wallet, 1 205 16
or 1 205 16
lots 1 205 16
of 1 205 16
phone 1 205 16
calls 1 205 16
to 1 205 16
Iraq 1 205 16
or 1 205 16
Syria, 1 205 16
or 1 205 16
a 1 205 16
note 1 205 16
from 1 205 16
Kazi 1 205 16
reading, 1 205 16
“I 1 205 16
did 1 205 16
this 1 205 16
for 1 205 16
Allah 1 205 16
and 1 205 16
Islam. 1 205 16

Allahu 1 205 17
akbar.” 1 205 17

Of 0 205 18
course, 0 205 18
even 0 205 18
if 0 205 18
they 0 205 18
had 0 205 18
found 0 205 18
those 0 205 18
things, 0 205 18
given 0 205 18
the 0 205 18
FBI’s 0 205 18
recent 0 205 18
track 0 205 18
record 0 205 18
of 0 205 18
denial 0 205 18
and 0 205 18
deception, 0 205 18
they 0 205 18
may 0 205 18
still 0 205 18
be 0 205 18
searching 0 205 18
for 0 205 18
Kazi’s 0 205 18
motive. 0 205 18

In 0 205 19
any 0 205 19
case, 0 205 19
a 0 205 19
larger 0 205 19
point 0 205 19
is 0 205 19
being 0 205 19
lost 0 205 19
here. 0 205 19

And 0 205 20
that 0 205 20
is 0 205 20
that 0 205 20
there 0 205 20

We 1 205 21
know 1 205 21
that 1 205 21
the 1 205 21
Islamic 1 205 21
State, 1 205 21
al-Qaeda 1 205 21
and 1 205 21
other 1 205 21
groups 1 205 21
have 1 205 21
called 1 205 21
upon 1 205 21
Muslims 1 205 21
in 1 205 21
the 1 205 21
U.S. 1 205 21
to 1 205 21
try 1 205 21
to 1 205 21
kill 1 205 21
military 1 205 21
personnel 1 205 21
and 1 205 21
police, 1 205 21
as 1 205 21
well 1 205 21
as 1 205 21
civilians. 1 205 21

We 0 205 22
know 0 205 22
that 0 205 22
Kazi, 0 205 22
with 0 205 22
all 0 205 22
the 0 205 22
propane 0 205 22
and 0 205 22
gas 0 205 22
tanks 0 205 22
in 0 205 22
his 0 205 22
car, 0 205 22
was 0 205 22
clearly 0 205 22
trying 0 205 22
to 0 205 22
set 0 205 22
off 0 205 22
a 0 205 22
major 0 205 22
fire 0 205 22
that 0 205 22
would 0 205 22
kill 0 205 22
more 0 205 22
people 0 205 22
than 0 205 22
just 0 205 22
himself. 0 205 22

Even 0 205 23
if 0 205 23
he 0 205 23
wasn’t 0 205 23
on 0 205 23
the 0 205 23
phone 0 205 23
to 0 205 23
Baghdadi, 0 205 23
the 0 205 23
likelihood 0 205 23
is 0 205 23
that 0 205 23
when 0 205 23
a 0 205 23
Muslim 0 205 23
drives 0 205 23
into 0 205 23
a 0 205 23
U.S. 0 205 23
Air 0 205 23
Force 0 205 23
Base 0 205 23
with 0 205 23
a 0 205 23
car 0 205 23
full 0 205 23
of 0 205 23
incendiaries, 0 205 23
probably 0 205 23
this 0 205 23
has 0 205 23
something 0 205 23
to 0 205 23
do 0 205 23
with 0 205 23
the 0 205 23
global 0 205 23
jihad. 0 205 23

The 1 205 24
FBI’s 1 205 24
bafflement 1 205 24
here 1 205 24
is 1 205 24
part 1 205 24
of 1 205 24
its 1 205 24
deep, 1 205 24
deep 1 205 24
corruption. 1 205 24

The 1 205 25
FBI 1 205 25
doesn’t 1 205 25
acknowledge 1 205 25
that 1 205 25
there 1 205 25
is 1 205 25
a 1 205 25
global 1 205 25
jihad, 1 205 25
or 1 205 25
that 1 205 25
Islam 1 205 25
has 1 205 25
anything 1 205 25
to 1 205 25
do 1 205 25
with 1 205 25
terrorism. 1 205 25

It 1 205 26
doesn’t 1 205 26
admit 1 205 26
that 1 205 26
there 1 205 26
is 1 205 26
a 1 205 26
war 1 205 26
going 1 205 26
on, 1 205 26
and 1 205 26
treats 1 205 26
each 1 205 26
act 1 205 26
of 1 205 26
Islamic 1 205 26
terror 1 205 26
as 1 205 26
if 1 205 26
it 1 205 26
were 1 205 26
a 1 205 26
separate 1 205 26
and 1 205 26
discrete 1 205 26
criminal 1 205 26
event, 1 205 26
unrelated 1 205 26
to 1 205 26
all 1 205 26
the 1 205 26
others. 1 205 26

So 1 205 27
each 1 205 27
time 1 205 27
something 1 205 27
like 1 205 27
this 1 205 27
happens, 1 205 27
they’re 1 205 27
back 1 205 27
at 1 205 27
Square 1 205 27
One, 1 205 27
trying 1 205 27
to 1 205 27
figure 1 205 27
out 1 205 27
motive. 1 205 27

It’s 0 205 28
as 0 205 28
if 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
U.S. 0 205 28
Army 0 205 28
stopped 0 205 28
to 0 205 28
interrogate 0 205 28
every 0 205 28
German 0 205 28
soldier 0 205 28
who 0 205 28
crashed 0 205 28
through 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
Ardennes 0 205 28

Battle 0 205 28
of 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
Bulge 0 205 28
in 0 205 28
1944, 0 205 28
to 0 205 28
see 0 205 28
if 0 205 28
each 0 205 28
one’s 0 205 28
actions 0 205 28
had 0 205 28
anything 0 205 28
to 0 205 28
do 0 205 28
with 0 205 28
the 0 205 28
German 1 205 28
Army 1 205 28
and 1 205 28
Adolf 1 205 28
Hitler’s 1 205 28
war 0 205 28
aims. 0 205 28

Authorities 0 205 29
are 0 205 29
also 0 205 29
investigating 0 205 29
whether 0 205 29
or 0 205 29
not 0 205 29
Kazi 0 205 29
was 0 205 29
suffering 0 205 29
from 0 205 29
any 0 205 29
mental 0 205 29
health 0 205 29
issues. 0 205 29

Here 0 205 30
again, 0 205 30
this 0 205 30
is 0 205 30
just 0 205 30
more 0 205 30
of 0 205 30
the 0 205 30

“Allahu 1 205 30

Sean 0 205 30
Ragan 0 205 30
might 0 205 30
explain 0 205 30
to 0 205 30
us 0 205 30
that 0 205 30
authorities 0 205 30
are 0 205 30
also 0 205 30
trying 0 205 30
to 0 205 30
determine 0 205 30
whether 0 205 30
the 0 205 30
German 1 205 30
invasion 1 205 30
of 1 205 30
Poland 1 205 30
in 1 205 30

was 1 205 30
motivated 1 205 30
by 1 205 30
Nazism, 1 205 30
or 0 205 30
by 0 205 30

among 0 205 30
the 0 205 30
German 0 205 30

Command. 0 205 30

This 0 205 31
willful 0 205 31
ignorance 0 205 31
leads 0 205 31
to 0 205 31
a 0 205 31
diversion 0 205 31
and 0 205 31
waste 0 205 31
of 0 205 31
resources 0 205 31
that 0 205 31
is 0 205 31
astronomical 1 205 31
and 1 205 31
catastrophic. 1 205 31

Ebola 0 208 13
is 0 208 13
one 0 208 13
of 0 208 13
the 0 208 13
world's 0 208 13
most 0 208 13

diseases, 0 208 13
being 0 208 13
both 0 208 13
highly 1 208 13
infectious 1 208 13
and 1 208 13
extremely 1 208 13
lethal. 1 208 13

It 0 208 14
is 0 208 14
caused 0 208 14
by 0 208 14
a 0 208 14
virus 0 208 14
that 0 208 14
has 0 208 14
a 0 208 14
natural 0 208 14

who 0 208 14

a 0 208 15
well-known 0 208 15

of 0 208 15
infection. 0 208 15

Following 0 208 16
an 0 208 16

period 0 208 16
of 0 208 16
between 0 208 16

Ebola 0 208 16

a 0 208 16

That 0 208 17
is 0 208 17
often 0 208 17
followed 0 208 17
by 0 208 17

The 0 208 18
worst-ever 0 208 18
Ebola 0 208 18
outbreak 0 208 18
started 0 208 18

That 0 208 19

killed 0 208 19
more 0 208 19
than 0 208 19
11,300 0 208 19

according 0 208 19

although 0 208 19
the 0 208 19
real 0 208 19

is 0 208 19
thought 0 208 19
to 0 208 19
be 0 208 19
significantly 0 208 19

than 0 208 20
99 0 208 20
percent 0 208 20
of 0 208 20

were 0 208 20

the 0 208 20
three 0 208 20
West 0 208 20

Early 0 208 22

gabbing 1 72 7

Hardly 0 72 13
an 0 72 13

for 0 72 13
North 0 72 13
Korea. 0 72 13

North 0 72 14
Korea 0 72 14
was 0 72 14
right 0 72 14
on 0 72 14
target 0 72 14
when 0 72 14
it 0 72 14
accused 0 72 14
arch-neocon 0 72 14
John 0 72 14
Bolton 0 72 14
of 0 72 14
trying 0 72 14
to 0 72 14
sabotage 0 72 14
the 0 72 14
peace 0 72 14
deal. 0 72 14

In 0 72 15
2005-2006, 0 72 15
Bolton 0 72 15
served 0 72 15
as 0 72 15
the 0 72 15
Bush 0 72 15
administration’s 0 72 15
ambassador 0 72 15
to 0 72 15
the 0 72 15
UN. 0 72 15

He 0 72 16
established 0 72 16
a 0 72 16
tradition 0 72 16
for 0 72 16
the 0 72 16
post 0 72 16
of 0 72 16
being 0 72 16
anti-Muslim, 0 72 16
pro-Israel 0 72 16
and 0 72 16
anti-Russian, 0 72 16
a 0 72 16
policy 0 72 16
continued 0 72 16
to 0 72 16
this 0 72 16
day 0 72 16
by 0 72 16
the 0 72 16
current 0 72 16
US 0 72 16
UN 0 72 16
rep, 0 72 16
loud-mouthed 0 72 16
neocon 0 72 16
Nikki 0 72 16
Haley. 0 72 16

In 0 72 17
the 0 72 17
2005-2006 0 72 17
period, 0 72 17
after 0 72 17
years 0 72 17
of 0 72 17
negotiations, 0 72 17
the 0 72 17
US 0 72 17
and 0 72 17
North 0 72 17
Korea 0 72 17
were 0 72 17
close 0 72 17
to 0 72 17
a 0 72 17
nuclear/peace 0 72 17
deal. 0 72 17

Enter 0 72 18
John 0 72 18
Bolton. 0 72 18

He 0 72 19
succeeded 0 72 19
in 0 72 19
sabotaging 0 72 19
the 0 72 19
US-North 0 72 19
Korea 0 72 19
deal. 0 72 19

Why? 0 72 20

Because 0 72 21
Bolton, 0 72 21
as 0 72 21
an 0 72 21
arch 0 72 21
neocon, 0 72 21
was 0 72 21
fanatically 1 72 21

nuclear 0 72 21
technology 0 72 21
to 0 72 21
Israel’s 0 72 21

As 0 72 22
usual 0 72 22
with 0 72 22
the 0 72 22
neocons, 0 72 22
Israel’s 0 72 22
interests 0 72 22
came 0 72 22
before 0 72 22
those 0 72 22
of 0 72 22
the 0 72 22
United 0 72 22
States. 0 72 22

Trump’s 0 72 23
newly 0 72 23
named 0 72 23
Secretary 0 72 23
of 0 72 23
State, 0 72 23
Michael 0 72 23
Pompeo, 0 72 23
is 0 72 23
also 0 72 23
an 0 72 23
ardent 0 72 23
neocon. 0 72 23

Last 0 72 24
week, 0 72 24
Bolton 0 72 24
went 0 72 24
onto 0 72 24
US 0 72 24
TV 0 72 24
and 0 72 24
actually 0 72 24
suggested 0 72 24
North 0 72 24
Korea 0 72 24
might 0 72 24
follow 0 72 24
the 0 72 24
course 0 72 24
set 0 72 24
by 0 72 24
Libya, 0 72 24
of 0 72 24
all 0 72 24
places. 0 72 24

Libya’s 0 72 25
then 0 72 25
ruler, 0 72 25
Muammar 0 72 25
Kadaffi, 0 72 25
bought 0 72 25
some 0 72 25
nuclear 0 72 25
equipment 0 72 25
from 0 72 25
Pakistan 0 72 25
so 0 72 25
he 0 72 25
could 0 72 25
hand 0 72 25
it 0 72 25
over 0 72 25
to 0 72 25
the 0 72 25
US 0 72 25
as 0 72 25
a 0 72 25
gesture 0 72 25
of 0 72 25
cooperation 0 72 25
after 0 72 25
the 0 72 25
Bush 0 72 25
administration 0 72 25
invaded 0 72 25
Iraq. 0 72 25

The 0 72 26
handover 0 72 26
was 0 72 26
done 0 72 26
with 0 72 26
much 1 72 26
fanfare, 1 72 26
then 0 72 26
the 0 72 26
US, 0 72 26
France 0 72 26
and 0 72 26
Britain 0 72 26
attacked 0 72 26
Libya 0 72 26
and 0 72 26
overthrew 0 72 26
Kadaffi. 0 72 26

The 0 72 27
hapless 1 72 27
Libyan 0 72 27
leader 0 72 27
was 0 72 27
eventually 0 72 27

Is 1 72 29
this 1 72 29
what 1 72 29
Bolton 1 72 29
has 1 72 29
in 1 72 29
mind 1 72 29
for 1 72 29
North 1 72 29
Korea? 1 72 29

The 0 72 30
Northerners 0 72 30
certainly 0 72 30
seemed 0 72 30
to 0 72 30
think 0 72 30
so. 0 72 30

Some 0 72 31
wondered 0 72 31
if 0 72 31
Bolton 0 72 31
and 0 72 31
perhaps 0 72 31
Pompeo 0 72 31
were 0 72 31
trying 0 72 31
to 0 72 31
sabotage 0 72 31
the 0 72 31
North 0 72 31
Korea 0 72 31
deal. 0 72 31

Or 0 72 32
were 0 72 32
at 0 72 32
least 0 72 32
being 0 72 32
incredibly 1 72 32
obtuse 1 72 32
and 0 72 32
belligerent. 0 72 32

Was 1 72 33
Trump 1 72 33
involved 1 72 33
in 1 72 33
this 1 72 33
intrigue? 1 72 33

Hard 0 72 34
to 0 72 34
tell. 0 72 34

But 0 72 35
he 0 72 35
can’t 0 72 35
be 0 72 35
happy. 0 72 35

His 0 72 36
minions 1 72 36
and 0 72 36
bootlickers 1 72 36
are 0 72 36
promoting 0 72 36

– 0 72 36
rather 0 72 36
ahead 0 72 36
of 0 72 36
events. 0 72 36

Or 0 72 37
was 0 72 37
the 0 72 37
US 0 72 37
military 0 72 37
rattling 0 72 37
its 0 72 37

up 0 72 40

out 0 222 1

a 0 222 16
blight 1 222 16
on 0 222 16
the 0 222 16
federal 0 222 16
regulatory 0 222 16
agencies 0 222 16
and 0 222 16
the 0 222 16
criminal 0 222 16
justice 0 222 16
system. 0 222 16

Rural 0 222 17
communities 0 222 17
of 0 222 17
the 0 222 17
West 0 222 17
are 0 222 17
greatly 1 222 17
appreciative 0 222 17
of 0 222 17
the 0 222 17
efforts 0 222 17
of 0 222 17
the 0 222 17

to 0 222 17
restore 0 222 17
the 0 222 17
economies 0 222 17
of 0 222 17
these 0 222 17
communities. 0 222 17

We 0 222 18
respectfully 0 222 18
ask 0 222 18
President 0 222 18
Trump 0 222 18
to 0 222 18
pardon 0 222 18
Dwight 0 222 18

Steven 0 222 18
Hammond. 0 222 18

I 1 222 19
completely 1 222 19
agree 1 222 19
with 0 222 19
that 0 222 19
assessment 0 222 19
and 0 222 19
fully 1 222 19
support 1 222 19
President 0 222 19
Trump 0 222 19
pardoning 0 222 19
these 0 222 19
men. 0 222 19

They 0 222 20
are 0 222 20
the 1 222 20
furthest 1 222 20
thing 1 222 20
from 0 222 20
terrorists. 0 222 20

They 0 222 21
are 0 222 21
hard-working, 1 222 21
family 0 222 21
ranchers 0 222 21
who 0 222 21
simply 0 222 21
were 0 222 21
doing 0 222 21
their 0 222 21
job. 0 222 21

I've 0 222 22
written 0 222 22
on 0 222 22
the 0 222 22
Hammond's 0 222 22

you 0 222 22
can 0 222 22
view 0 222 22

Many 0 222 23
of 0 222 23

these 0 222 23

when 0 222 23
the 0 222 23

until 0 222 24
after 0 222 24
the 0 222 24

but 0 222 24
when 0 222 24
we 0 222 24
asked 0 222 24
for 0 222 24
people 0 222 24
to 0 222 24
step 0 222 24
up 0 222 24

for 0 222 24
his 0 222 24

we 0 222 24
couldn't 0 222 24
get 0 222 24
1,000 0 222 24
signatures. 0 222 24

Please, 0 222 25
put 0 222 25
yourself 0 222 25
in 0 222 25
the 0 222 25
position 0 222 25
of 0 222 25
these 0 222 25

ranchers 0 222 25
and 0 222 25
consider 0 222 25
if 0 222 25
you 0 222 25
would 0 222 25
appreciate 0 222 25
someone 0 222 25
simply 0 222 25
taking 0 222 25
the 0 222 25
time 0 222 25
to 0 222 25
put 0 222 25
their 0 222 25

on 0 222 25
a 0 222 25

it 0 73 3

a 0 73 5

of 0 73 5

after 0 73 5
it 0 73 5
had 0 73 5
been 0 73 5
completely 0 73 5

it 0 73 5
paints 0 73 5
a 0 73 5
depressing 1 73 5
picture; 0 73 5
but 0 73 5
as 0 73 5
a 0 73 5
demonstration 0 73 5
of 0 73 5
what 0 73 5

are 0 73 5
likely 0 73 5
to 0 73 5
achieve 0 73 5
once 0 73 5

in 0 73 5

The 0 73 7
report 0 73 7
shows 0 73 7
average 0 73 7
ages 0 73 7
of 0 73 7
nuns 0 73 7
between 0 73 7
65 0 73 7
and 0 73 7
80, 0 73 7

no 0 73 7
one 0 73 7
in 0 73 7
formation. 0 73 7

Solutions 0 73 8
offered 0 73 8
are 0 73 8
equally 0 73 8
uniform: 0 73 8
heaped-up 0 73 8
bureaucracy, 0 73 8
common 0 73 8
formation 0 73 8
courses 0 73 8
between 0 73 8
monasteries 0 73 8
developed 0 73 8
by 0 73 8
“religious 0 73 8
psychologists,” 0 73 8
ever 0 73 8
more 0 73 8
powers 0 73 8
handed 0 73 8
to 0 73 8
federations. 0 73 8

This 0 73 9
is 0 73 9
federated 0 73 9
Carmelite 0 73 9
monastic 0 73 9
life 0 73 9
under 0 73 9
Pope 0 73 9

New 0 73 9
Paradigm 0 73 9
of 0 73 9
fully 0 73 9
implemented 0 73 9
VaticanTwoism. 0 73 9

Very 0 73 10
little 0 73 10
is 0 73 10
said 0 73 10
of 0 73 10
any 0 73 10
efforts 0 73 10
being 0 73 10
made 0 73 10

And 0 73 11
perhaps 0 73 11
most 0 73 11
telling 0 73 11
of 0 73 11
all, 0 73 11
not 0 73 11
one 0 73 11
word 0 73 11
is 0 73 11
offered 0 73 11
of 0 73 11
applying 0 73 11
any 0 73 11
systematic 0 73 11

solutions; 0 73 11
no 0 73 11
one 0 73 11
is 0 73 11
suggesting 0 73 11

what 0 73 11
has 0 73 11
to 0 73 11
be 0 73 11
the 0 73 11
Carmelite 0 73 11
Order’s 0 73 11
most 1 73 11
desperate 1 73 11
hour. 0 73 11

Nothing 0 73 12
is 0 73 12
said 0 73 12
of 0 73 12
increased 0 73 12
intensity 0 73 12
of 0 73 12
devotion 0 73 12
to 0 73 12
the 0 73 12
charism, 0 73 12
study 0 73 12
of 0 73 12
the 0 73 12
foundress 0 73 12
or 0 73 12
returning 0 73 12
to 0 73 12
sources, 0 73 12
still 1 73 12
less 1 73 12
of 0 73 12
strengthening 0 73 12
the 0 73 12
Carmelites’ 0 73 12
traditional 0 73 12
independent 0 73 12
self-governance 0 73 12
or 0 73 12
reconsidering 0 73 12
the 0 73 12
wisdom 0 73 12
of 0 73 12
“the 0 73 12
path 0 73 12
taken”. 0 73 12

Indeed, 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
one 0 73 13
case 0 73 13
in 0 73 13
Spain, 0 73 13
the 0 73 13
sisters 0 73 13
themselves 0 73 13
advocate 0 73 13
abandoning 0 73 13
traditional 0 73 13
Teresian 0 73 13
autonomy 0 73 13
altogether. 0 73 13

The 0 73 14
report 0 73 14
from 0 73 14

notes: 0 73 14
“18 0 73 14
Carmels 0 73 14

closed 0 73 14
in 0 73 14
the 0 73 14
last 0 73 14
40 0 73 14
years. 0 73 14

There 0 73 15
have 0 73 15
been 0 73 15
two 0 73 15
amalgamations 0 73 15
in 0 73 15
recent 0 73 15
years 0 73 15
and 0 73 15
another 0 73 15

Two 0 73 16
communities 0 73 16
at 0 73 16
present 0 73 16
are 0 73 16
living 0 73 16
together 0 73 16
in 0 73 16
one 0 73 16
monastery 0 73 16
as 0 73 16
a 0 73 16
temporary 0 73 16
measure.” 0 73 16

The 0 73 17
case 0 73 17
of 0 73 17
the 0 73 17
Netherlands 0 73 17
is 0 73 17
downright 1 73 17
bizarre; 1 73 17
sisters 0 73 17
so 0 73 17
old 0 73 17
that 0 73 17
even 0 73 17
the 0 73 17
federation 0 73 17
structures 0 73 17
are 0 73 17
breaking 0 73 17
down. 0 73 17

Only 0 73 18
one 0 73 18
fully 0 73 18
autonomous 0 73 18
functioning 0 73 18
Carmel 0 73 18
still 0 73 18
exists 0 73 18
in 0 73 18
the 0 73 18
Netherlands, 0 73 18
and 0 73 18
the 0 73 18
remains 0 73 18
of 0 73 18
four 0 73 18
entire 0 73 18
communities 0 73 18

living 0 73 18
in 0 73 18
a 0 73 18
single 0 73 18

home 0 73 18
run 0 73 18
by 0 73 18
religious 0 73 18
brothers. 0 73 18

But 0 73 19
in 0 73 19
this 0 73 19
situation, 0 73 19
the 0 73 19
“solution” 0 73 19
undertaken 0 73 19
has 0 73 19
been 0 73 19
an 0 73 19
elaborate 0 73 19
bureaucratic 0 73 19
reshuffle, 0 73 19
including 0 73 19
gaining 0 73 19
approval 0 73 19
from 0 73 19
Rome, 0 73 19
for 0 73 19
“a 0 73 19
completely 0 73 19
new 0 73 19
structure,” 0 73 19
whose 0 73 19
main 0 73 19
task, 0 73 19
no 0 73 19
doubt, 0 73 19
will 0 73 19
be 0 73 19
the 0 73 19
making 0 73 19
of 0 73 19
funeral 0 73 19
arrangements 0 73 19
and 0 73 19
disposing 0 73 19
of 0 73 19
library 0 73 19
books. 0 73 19

The 0 73 20
atmosphere 0 73 20
is 0 73 20
weirdly 0 73 20

in 0 73 22
the 0 73 22

the 0 73 22

This 0 73 25
outlier 0 73 25
differs 0 73 25
from 0 73 25
the 0 73 25
Western 0 73 25
European 0 73 25
federations 0 73 25

that 0 73 25
it 0 73 25
was 0 73 25
only 0 73 25
federated 0 73 25
in 0 73 25

the 0 73 26
effects 0 73 26
of 0 73 26
the 0 73 26
federating/formation 0 73 26
courses 0 73 26
are 0 73 26
already 0 73 26
being 0 73 26
felt: 0 73 26
“Nowadays, 0 73 26
two 0 73 26

however 0 73 27
this 0 73 27
community 0 73 27
is 0 73 27
not 0 73 27
federated. 0 73 27

From 0 73 28
the 0 73 28
beginning, 0 73 28
our 0 73 28
Association 0 73 28
has 0 73 28

the 0 73 32

but 0 73 32
there 0 73 32
are 0 73 32
differences 0 73 32
between 0 73 32
the 0 73 32

balance 0 73 88
within 0 73 88

communities, 0 73 88
based 0 73 88
on 0 73 88
the 0 73 88

communities 0 73 88
and 0 73 88
the 0 73 88

Present 0 73 89
Problems: 0 73 89
Ageing 0 73 89
of 0 73 89
the 0 73 89
communities, 0 73 89
resulting 0 73 89
in 0 73 89
weakening 0 73 89
of 0 73 89
life 0 73 89
in 0 73 89
all 0 73 89
its 0 73 89
facets. 0 73 89

It 0 73 90
is 0 73 90
not 0 73 90
easy 0 73 90
to 0 73 90
express 0 73 90
the 0 73 90
reality. 0 73 90

A 0 73 91
lack 0 73 91
of 0 73 91
vocations 0 73 91
is 0 73 91
with 0 73 91
us 0 73 91
as 0 73 91
a 0 73 91
reality 0 73 91
in 0 73 91
everyday 0 73 91
life. 0 73 91

Moreover, 0 73 92
the 0 73 92
high 0 73 92
number 0 73 92
of 0 73 92
Carmels 0 73 92
makes 0 73 92
difficult 0 73 92
to 0 73 92
maintain 0 73 92
all 0 73 92
presences. 0 73 92

Possible 0 73 93
Solutions: 0 73 93
It 0 73 93
is 0 73 93
completely 0 73 93
necessary 0 73 93
to 0 73 93
assume 0 73 93
the 0 73 93
way 0 73 93
of 0 73 93
the 0 73 93
restructurings, 0 73 93
in 0 73 93
order 0 73 93
to 0 73 93
live 0 73 93
what 0 73 93
is 0 73 93
essential, 0 73 93
forgetting 0 73 93
the 0 73 93
numbers. 0 73 93

The 0 73 94
challenge 0 73 94
to 0 73 94
grow 0 73 94
in 0 73 94
confidence 0 73 94
and 0 73 94
communion 0 73 94
should 0 73 94
lead 0 73 94
us 0 73 94
to 0 73 94
downgrade 0 73 94
the 0 73 94
famous 0 73 94
and 0 73 94
untouchable 0 73 94
autonomy 0 73 94
because, 0 73 94
to 0 73 94
a 0 73 94
daughter 0 73 94
of 0 73 94
Saint 0 73 94
Teresa, 0 73 94
the 0 73 94
really 0 73 94
important 0 73 94
thing 0 73 94
is 0 73 94
to 0 73 94
look 0 73 94
for 0 73 94
HIM 0 73 94
and 0 73 94
to 0 73 94
live 0 73 94
in 0 73 94
obedience. 0 73 94

Another 0 73 95
of 0 73 95
our 0 73 95
challenges 0 73 95
is 0 73 95
caring 0 73 95
[for] 0 73 95

We 0 73 96
think 0 73 96
this 0 73 96
is 0 73 96
the 0 73 96
way 0 73 96
will 0 73 96
lead 0 73 96
us 0 73 96
to 0 73 96

solutions: 0 73 149
The 0 73 149
Federation 0 73 149
Council, 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
Religious 0 73 149
Assistant, 0 73 149
together 0 73 149
with 0 73 149
a 0 73 149
canon 0 73 149
lawyer 0 73 149
of 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
Dutch 0 73 149
Conference 0 73 149
of 0 73 149
Religious, 0 73 149
have 0 73 149
worked 0 73 149
hard 0 73 149
on 0 73 149
a 0 73 149
completely 0 73 149
new 0 73 149
structure, 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
which 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
its 0 73 149
first 0 73 149
draft 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
autonomy 0 73 149
of 0 73 149
the 0 73 149
Carmel 0 73 149
has 0 73 149
been 0 73 149
constantly 0 73 149
kept 0 73 149
in 0 73 149
mind. 0 73 149

We 0 73 150
began 0 73 150
from 0 73 150
three 0 73 150
points: 0 73 150

1)Maintenance 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
formal 0 73 151
autonomy 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
Carmels 0 73 151
that 0 73 151
still 0 73 151
exist, 0 73 151
but 0 73 151
with 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
chance 0 73 151
to 0 73 151
transfer 0 73 151
tasks 0 73 151
gradually 0 73 151
to 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
council 0 73 151
of 0 73 151
the 0 73 151
Federation. 0 73 151

2)Appointment 0 73 152
of 0 73 152
The 0 73 152
Federal 0 73 152
board 0 73 152
or 0 73 152
Federal 0 73 152
Council 0 73 152
of 0 73 152
the 0 73 152
Federation, 0 73 152
preferably 0 73 152
appointed 0 73 152
by 0 73 152
the 0 73 152
Superior 0 73 152
General. 0 73 152

The 0 73 153
team 0 73 153
will 0 73 153
consist 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
a 0 73 153
president 0 73 153
and 0 73 153
vice-president 0 73 153
who 0 73 153
are 0 73 153
members 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
one 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
the 0 73 153
convents, 0 73 153
appointed 0 73 153
to 0 73 153
functions, 0 73 153
and 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
three 0 73 153
people 0 73 153
who 0 73 153
are 0 73 153
members, 0 73 153
or 0 73 153
not, 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
one 0 73 153
of 0 73 153
the 0 73 153
convents. 0 73 153

3)A 0 73 154
Supervisory 0 73 154
council, 0 73 154
also 0 73 154
to 0 73 154
be 0 73 154
appointed 0 73 154
periodically 0 73 154
by 0 73 154
the 0 73 154
Superior 0 73 154
General, 0 73 154
which 0 73 154
will 0 73 154
be 0 73 154
made 0 73 154
up 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
three 0 73 154
members, 0 73 154
whose 0 73 154
president 0 73 154
will 0 73 154
be, 0 73 154
preferably, 0 73 154
a 0 73 154
member 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
a 0 73 154
religious 0 73 154
institute, 0 73 154
preferably 0 73 154
of 0 73 154
the 0 73 154
Carmelite 0 73 154
Order 0 73 154
and 0 73 154
appointed 0 73 154
to 0 73 154
functions. 0 73 154

This 0 73 155
council 0 73 155
sees 0 73 155
itself 0 73 155
as 0 73 155
a 0 73 155
supervisory 0 73 155
body 0 73 155
and 0 73 155
to 0 73 155
give 0 73 155
advice 0 73 155
that 0 73 155
will 0 73 155
more 0 73 155
or 0 73 155
less 0 73 155
replace 0 73 155
the 0 73 155
Assembly 0 73 155
of 0 73 155
the 0 73 155
Federation. 0 73 155

In 0 73 156
October 0 73 156
2008, 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
President, 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
Religious 0 73 156
Assistant 0 73 156
and 0 73 156
a 0 73 156
Lawyer 0 73 156
were 0 73 156
in 0 73 156
Rome 0 73 156
where 0 73 156
they 0 73 156
explained 0 73 156
the 0 73 156
proposals. 0 73 156

They 0 73 157
had 0 73 157
meetings 0 73 157
with 0 73 157
Fr. 0 73 157

General 0 73 158
and 0 73 158
with 0 73 158
the 0 73 158
Congregation 0 73 158
for 0 73 158
Religious. 0 73 158

These 0 73 159
were 0 73 159
open 0 73 159
meetings 0 73 159
that 0 73 159
helped 0 73 159
us 0 73 159
to 0 73 159
clarify 0 73 159
matters. 0 73 159

An 0 73 160
important 0 73 160
concern 0 73 160
was 0 73 160
that 0 73 160
they 0 73 160
would 0 73 160
allow 0 73 160
us 0 73 160
to 0 73 160
use 0 73 160
lay 0 73 160
people 0 73 160
on 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Federal 0 73 160
Council 0 73 160
of 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Federation 0 73 160
and 0 73 160
the 0 73 160
Supervisory 0 73 160
council. 0 73 160

We 0 73 161
were 0 73 161
aware 0 73 161
that 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
were 0 73 161
not 0 73 161
dealing 0 73 161
with 0 73 161
a 0 73 161
simple 0 73 161
matter, 0 73 161
but 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
think 0 73 161
that, 0 73 161
in 0 73 161
view 0 73 161
of 0 73 161
our 0 73 161
present 0 73 161
situation 0 73 161
today, 0 73 161
we 0 73 161
do 0 73 161
not 0 73 161
have 0 73 161
much 0 73 161
choice. 0 73 161

It 0 73 162
is 0 73 162
important 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
continue 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
protect 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
interests 0 73 162
of 0 73 162
our 0 73 162
Federation 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
most 0 73 162
responsible 0 73 162
and 0 73 162
careful 0 73 162
way, 0 73 162
so 0 73 162
that 0 73 162
all 0 73 162
the 0 73 162
sisters, 0 73 162
even 0 73 162
those 0 73 162
advanced 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
years, 0 73 162
can 0 73 162
continue 0 73 162
to 0 73 162
live 0 73 162
their 0 73 162
life 0 73 162
in 0 73 162
Carmel. 0 73 162

Definitive 0 73 163
permission 0 73 163
came 0 73 163
at 0 73 163
the 0 73 163
25th 0 73 163
of 0 73 163
February. 0 73 163

~~~ 0 73 164

Given 0 73 165
this 0 73 165
incredible 1 73 165
picture 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
a 0 73 165
Carmelite 0 73 165
Order 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
last 0 73 165
rattle 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
its 0 73 165
death 1 73 165
throes, 1 73 165
the 0 73 165
rest 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
summaries 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
speeches 0 73 165
given 0 73 165
at 0 73 165
the 0 73 165
meeting 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
Avila 0 73 165
read 0 73 165
as 0 73 165
outright 0 73 165
surreal, 0 73 165
leaving 0 73 165
us 0 73 165
to 0 73 165
wonder 0 73 165
if 0 73 165
any 0 73 165
of 0 73 165
these 0 73 165
people 0 73 165
are 0 73 165
attached 0 73 165
in 0 73 165
any 0 73 165
way 0 73 165
to 0 73 165
reality. 0 73 165

Sr. 0 73 166
Enrica 0 73 166
Rosanna, 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
representative 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
Vatican’s 0 73 166
Congregation 0 73 166
for 0 73 166
Religious 0 73 166
told 0 73 166
them 0 73 166
that 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
“two 0 73 166
great 0 73 166
challenges 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
our 0 73 166
contemplative 0 73 166
life” 0 73 166
are 0 73 166
“the 0 73 166
challenge 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
globalization 0 73 166
and 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
challenge 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
irrelevancy.” 0 73 166
She 0 73 166
warned 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
nuns 0 73 166
against 0 73 166
bringing 0 73 166
vocations 0 73 166
from 0 73 166
other 0 73 166
countries 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
keep 0 73 166
their 0 73 166
monasteries 0 73 166
alive, 0 73 166
dropping 0 73 166
a 0 73 166
hint 0 73 166
about 0 73 166
what 0 73 166
now 0 73 166
seems 0 73 166
to 0 73 166
be 0 73 166
a 0 73 166
particular 0 73 166
obsession 0 73 166
of 0 73 166
the 0 73 166
Congregation. 0 73 166

Cor 0 73 167
orans 0 73 167
would 0 73 167
take 0 73 167
this 0 73 167
subject 0 73 167
up 0 73 167
definitively 0 73 167
in 0 73 167
2018: 0 73 167

The 0 73 168
nuns 0 73 168
were 0 73 168
exhorted 0 73 168
to 0 73 168
“stay 0 73 168
awake 0 73 168
to 0 73 168
welcome 0 73 168
the 0 73 168
dawn” 0 73 168
of 0 73 168
a 0 73 168
bright 0 73 168
new 0 73 168
future: 0 73 168

“These 0 73 169
are 0 73 169
difficult 0 73 169
and 0 73 169
uncertain 0 73 169
times, 0 73 169
but 0 73 169
it 0 73 169
is 0 73 169
also 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
time 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
stay 0 73 169
awake 0 73 169
as 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
new 0 73 169
dawn 0 73 169
is 0 73 169
already 0 73 169
announcing 0 73 169
itself.” 0 73 169
“Our 0 73 169
aim 0 73 169
must 0 73 169
be 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
be 0 73 169
open 0 73 169
to 0 73 169
the 0 73 169
future. 0 73 169

We 0 73 170
should 0 73 170
not 0 73 170
forget 0 73 170
that 0 73 170
we 0 73 170
are 0 73 170
following 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
the 0 73 170
tradition 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
Teresa 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
Jesus 0 73 170
and 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
the 0 73 170
tradition 0 73 170
of 0 73 170
all 0 73 170
those 0 73 170
who 0 73 170
have 0 73 170
followed 0 73 170
in 0 73 170
her 0 73 170
footsteps. 0 73 170

It 0 73 171
is 0 73 171
a 0 73 171
wide 0 73 171
road 0 73 171
that 0 73 171
opens 0 73 171
up 0 73 171
before 0 73 171
us. 0 73 171

We 0 73 172
must 0 73 172
be 0 73 172
women 0 73 172
of 0 73 172
hope 0 73 172
and 0 73 172
faith. 0 73 172

We 0 73 173
must 0 73 173
always 0 73 173
believe 0 73 173
that 0 73 173
God 0 73 173
is 0 73 173
the 0 73 173
one 0 73 173
who 0 73 173
directs 0 73 173
history. 0 73 173

From 0 73 174
this 0 73 174
derives 0 73 174
our 0 73 174
task, 0 73 174
to 0 73 174
be 0 73 174
creative 0 73 174
and, 0 73 174
at 0 73 174
the 0 73 174
same 0 73 174
time, 0 73 174
faithful 0 73 174
(creative 0 73 174
fidelity).” 0 73 174
[emphasis 0 73 174
in 0 73 174
the 0 73 174
original.] 0 73 174

While 0 73 175
there 0 73 175
can 0 73 175
be 0 73 175
no 0 73 175
doubt 0 73 175
that 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
impending 1 73 175
total 1 73 175
extinction 1 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
Carmelite 0 73 175
Order 0 73 175
in 0 73 175
Western 0 73 175
Europe 0 73 175
was 0 73 175
foremost 0 73 175
in 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
minds 0 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
nuns 0 73 175
present, 0 73 175
it 0 73 175
seems 0 73 175
that 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
issue 0 73 175
was 0 73 175
simply 0 73 175
not 0 73 175
addressed 0 73 175
out 0 73 175
loud 0 73 175
by 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
representatives 0 73 175
of 0 73 175
the 0 73 175
bureaucracy. 0 73 175

Instead, 0 73 176
Sr. 0 73 176
Enrica, 0 73 176
after 0 73 176
this 0 73 176
bizarre 0 73 176
and 0 73 176
cryptic 0 73 176
comment, 0 73 176
spoke 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
the 0 73 176
“problems 0 73 176
and 0 73 176
difficulties 0 73 176
that 0 73 176
we 0 73 176
can 0 73 176
encounter” 0 73 176
in 0 73 176
discernment 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
mostly 0 73 176
non-existent 0 73 176
vocations, 0 73 176
including 0 73 176
“consumerism, 0 73 176
modern 0 73 176
means 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
communication, 0 73 176
difficulties 0 73 176
in 0 73 176
creating 0 73 176
a 0 73 176
stable 0 73 176
personality, 0 73 176
autonomy 0 73 176
of 0 73 176
the 0 73 176

the 0 73 176
need 0 73 176
to 0 73 176
be 0 73 176
always 0 73 176

the 0 73 176

What 1 73 177
are 1 73 177
these 1 73 177
people 1 73 177
smoking? 1 73 177

Given 0 73 178
that 0 73 178
this 0 73 178
was 0 73 178
three 0 73 178
years 0 73 178
or 0 73 178
more 0 73 178
from 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
abdication 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
Benedict 0 73 178
and 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
installation 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
the 0 73 178
New 0 73 178
Paradigm 0 73 178
of 0 73 178
Francis/Kasper, 0 73 178
one 0 73 178
wonders 0 73 178
what 0 73 178
this 0 73 178
“new 0 73 178
dawn” 0 73 178
was 0 73 178
actually 0 73 178
about. 0 73 178

Perhaps 0 73 179
a 0 73 179
useful 0 73 179
question 0 73 179
for 0 73 179
one 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
nuns 0 73 179
present 0 73 179
could 0 73 179
have 0 73 179
been, 0 73 179
“A 0 73 179
‘new 1 73 179
dawn’ 1 73 179
of 0 73 179
what, 0 73 179
exactly?” 0 73 179
This 0 73 179
kind 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
coded 0 73 179
language 0 73 179
has 0 73 179
been 0 73 179
popular 0 73 179
with 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
progressivist 0 73 179
faction 0 73 179
in 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
Church 0 73 179
since 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
1960s, 0 73 179
when 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
expectation 0 73 179
was 0 73 179
for 0 73 179
the 0 73 179
installation 0 73 179
of 0 73 179
a 0 73 179
totally 0 73 179
new 0 73 179
Church. 0 73 179

Was 0 73 180
Sr. 0 73 180
Enrica 0 73 180
somehow 0 73 180
anticipating 0 73 180
the 0 73 180
fulfillment 0 73 180
of 0 73 180
those 0 73 180
hippie-era 0 73 180
dreams 0 73 180
in 0 73 180
the 0 73 180
years 0 73 180
to 0 73 180
come? 0 73 180

It 0 73 181
is 0 73 181
certainly 0 73 181
clear 0 73 181
from 0 73 181
Francis’ 0 73 181
first 0 73 181
acts 0 73 181
as 0 73 181
pope 0 73 181
that 0 73 181
he 0 73 181
had 0 73 181
dealing 0 73 181
with 0 73 181
conservative 0 73 181
and 0 73 181
Traditionalist 0 73 181

on 0 73 181
his 0 73 181
list 0 73 181
of 0 73 181
priorities. 0 73 181

His 0 73 182
first 0 73 182
appointment, 0 73 182
no 0 73 182
more 0 73 182
than 0 73 182
three 0 73 182
weeks 0 73 182
after 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Conclave 0 73 182
was 0 73 182
Jose 0 73 182

Carballo, 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Religious 0 73 182
Congregation’s 0 73 182
Secretary 0 73 182
and 0 73 182
– 0 73 182
given 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
scandal 0 73 182
that 0 73 182
erupted 0 73 182
on 0 73 182
his 0 73 182
leaving 0 73 182
them 0 73 182
– 0 73 182
the 0 73 182

of 0 73 182
the 0 73 182
Franciscan 0 73 182

Minor. 0 73 182

The 0 73 183
first 0 73 183
task 0 73 183
Francis 0 73 183
gave 0 73 183
Carballo 0 73 183
was 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
demolition 1 73 183
of 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
Franciscan 0 73 183
Friars 0 73 183
of 0 73 183
the 0 73 183
Immaculate. 0 73 183

Certainly 0 73 184
this 0 73 184
record 0 73 184
of 0 73 184
the 0 73 184
European 0 73 184
Carmelites’ 0 73 184
meeting 0 73 184
is 0 73 184
jammed 0 73 184
with 0 73 184
hints 0 73 184
that 0 73 184
Cor 0 73 184
orans 0 73 184
was 0 73 184
on 0 73 184
the 0 73 184
way. 0 73 184

On 0 73 185
the 0 73 185
final 0 73 185
day 0 73 185
of 0 73 185
the 0 73 185
meeting, 0 73 185
the 0 73 185
“theme 0 73 185
for 0 73 185

was 0 73 185
offered 0 73 185
by 0 73 185
then-Father 0 73 185
General 0 73 185
Luis 0 73 185
Arostegui: 0 73 185
“Government: 0 73 185

The 0 73 188
devolution 0 73 188
of 0 73 188
authority 0 73 188
of 0 73 188

of 0 73 188
individual 0 73 188
monasteries 0 73 188
to 0 73 188
federations 0 73 188
was 0 73 188
obviously 0 73 188
on 0 73 188
someone’s 0 73 188
mind, 0 73 188
as 0 73 188
was 0 73 188
a 0 73 188
plan 0 73 188
to 0 73 188
see 0 73 188
to 0 73 188
it 0 73 188
that 0 73 188
monasteries 0 73 188
change 0 73 188
superiors 0 73 188
frequently: 0 73 188
“Essential 0 73 188
autonomy 0 73 188
can 0 73 188
fail 0 73 188

the 0 73 188
Father 0 73 188
General 0 73 188
warned. 0 73 188

And 0 73 189
there 0 73 189
were 0 73 189
certainly 0 73 189
hints 0 73 189
that 0 73 189
a 0 73 189
general 0 73 189
re-organisation 0 73 189
of 0 73 189

in 0 73 189

to 0 73 190

rather 0 73 190
than 0 73 190
make 0 73 190
suggestions, 0 73 190
and 0 73 190
Arostegui 0 73 190
asked 0 73 190
some 0 73 190
very 0 73 190
leading 0 73 190
questions 0 73 190
indeed 0 73 190
in 0 73 190
this 0 73 190

Maybe 0 73 206
this 0 73 206
summary 0 73 206
document 0 73 206
of 0 73 206
2009 0 73 206
can 0 73 206
give 0 73 206
us 0 73 206
an 0 73 206
idea 0 73 206
what 0 73 206
to 0 73 206
expect 0 73 206
from 0 73 206
Rome 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
2018, 0 73 206
now 0 73 206
that 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
“progressivist” 0 73 206
faction 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
Vatican 0 73 206
is 0 73 206
in 0 73 206
the 0 73 206
ascendancy 0 73 206
and 0 73 206
is 0 73 206
free 0 73 206
to 0 73 206
act 0 73 206
without 0 73 206
restriction. 0 73 206

What 0 73 207
comes 0 73 207
clear 0 73 207
comparing 0 73 207
this 0 73 207
document 0 73 207
to 0 73 207
Cor 0 73 207
orans 0 73 207
is 0 73 207
that 0 73 207
the 0 73 207
Vatican’s 0 73 207
machinery 0 73 207
has 0 73 207
long 0 73 207
been 0 73 207
at 0 73 207
work 0 73 207
forcing 0 73 207
a 0 73 207
uniform 0 73 207
and 0 73 207
essentially 0 73 207
bureaucratic, 0 73 207
heavily 0 73 207
authoritarian 0 73 207
and 0 73 207
legalistic 0 73 207
vision 0 73 207
of 0 73 207
contemplative 0 73 207
life 0 73 207
on 0 73 207
anyone 0 73 207
who 0 73 207
fails 0 73 207
sufficiently 0 73 207
to 0 73 207
resist 0 73 207
it. 0 73 207

And 0 73 208
with 0 73 208
the 0 73 208
statistics 0 73 208
offered 0 73 208
at 0 73 208
this 0 73 208
meeting 0 73 208
we 0 73 208
can 0 73 208
see 0 73 208
clearly 0 73 208
where 0 73 208
this 0 73 208
road 0 73 208
leads. 0 73 208

So 0 73 209
many 0 73 209
Catholics 0 73 209
in 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
last 0 73 209
40 0 73 209
years 0 73 209
assumed 0 73 209
that 0 73 209
under 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
“conservatives” 0 73 209
John 0 73 209
Paul 0 73 209
II 0 73 209
and 0 73 209
Benedict 0 73 209
XVI 0 73 209
at 0 73 209
least 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
Vatican 0 73 209
was 0 73 209
“onside.” 0 73 209
At 0 73 209
least 0 73 209
in 0 73 209
Rome 0 73 209
they 0 73 209
understood 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
terrible 1 73 209
threat 0 73 209
of 0 73 209
the 0 73 209
Bolshie 0 73 209
VaticanTwoist 0 73 209
revolutionaries. 0 73 209

But 0 73 210
this 0 73 210
report 0 73 210
of 0 73 210
2009 0 73 210
shows 0 73 210
a 0 73 210
clear 0 73 210
picture 0 73 210
of 0 73 210
a 0 73 210
Roman 0 73 210
congregation 0 73 210
determined 0 73 210
to 0 73 210
see 0 73 210
the 0 73 210
revolution 0 73 210
through 0 73 210
to 0 73 210
its 0 73 210
inevitable 0 73 210
conclusion. 0 73 210

“They 1 244 16
used 1 244 16
me 1 244 16

worse: 1 254 2
“The 0 254 2

This 0 254 3
revelation 0 254 3
comes 0 254 3
after 0 254 3
the 0 254 3
news 0 254 3

to 0 254 3

is 0 254 4
a 0 254 4
law 0 254 4

In 0 254 6
a 0 254 6
sane 0 254 6
political 0 254 6
environment, 0 254 6
Barack 0 254 6
Obama 0 254 6
would 0 254 6
be 0 254 6
tried 0 254 6
for 0 254 6
treason. 1 254 6

Barack 0 254 7
Hussein 0 254 7
Obama 0 254 7
has 0 254 7
planted 0 254 7
seeds 0 254 7
that 0 254 7
will 0 254 7
be 0 254 7

bitter 0 254 7

probably 1 254 7
decades, 1 254 7
to 0 254 7

He 0 254 8
is, 0 254 8
without 0 254 8
any 0 254 8
doubt, 0 254 8
the 1 254 8
worst 1 254 8
President 0 254 8
in 0 254 8
American 0 254 8
history. 0 254 8

Fillmore, 0 254 9
Pierce, 0 254 9
Buchanan? 0 254 9

Yes, 0 254 10
the 0 254 10
doughface 0 254 10
Presidents 0 254 10
made 0 254 10
the 0 254 10
Civil 0 254 10
War 0 254 10
inevitable, 0 254 10
but 0 254 10
worse 0 254 10
came 0 254 10
later. 0 254 10

Grant? 0 254 11

Blind 1 254 12
to 1 254 12
corruption 1 254 12
and 0 254 12
out 0 254 12
of 0 254 12
his 0 254 12
depth, 0 254 12
but 0 254 12
there 0 254 12
have 0 254 12
been 0 254 12
worse 0 254 12
than 0 254 12
he 0 254 12
as 0 254 12
well. 0 254 12

Wilson? 0 254 13

That 0 254 14
black-hearted 1 254 14
Presbyterian 1 254 14
bigot 1 254 14
arguably 0 254 14
gave 0 254 14

Hitler 0 254 14
and 0 254 14
World 0 254 14
War 0 254 14
II, 0 254 14
so 0 254 14
he 0 254 14
is 0 254 14
definitely 0 254 14
in 0 254 14
the 0 254 14
Final 0 254 14
Four. 0 254 14

Harding? 0 254 15

Nah: 0 254 16
his 0 254 16
tax 0 254 16
cuts 0 254 16
and 0 254 16
return 0 254 16
to 0 254 16
“normalcy” 0 254 16
got 0 254 16
the 0 254 16
American 0 254 16
economy, 0 254 16
and 0 254 16
the 0 254 16
Twenties, 0 254 16
roaring. 0 254 16

FDR 0 254 17
and 0 254 17
LBJ 0 254 17
gave 0 254 17
us 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
modern 0 254 17
welfare 0 254 17
state 0 254 17
and 0 254 17
dependent 0 254 17
classes 0 254 17
automatically 0 254 17
voting 0 254 17
Democrat; 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
full 0 254 17
bill 0 254 17
on 0 254 17
the 0 254 17
damage 0 254 17
they 0 254 17
did 0 254 17
hasn’t 0 254 17
yet 0 254 17
been 0 254 17
presented. 0 254 17

Nixon? 0 254 18

A 0 254 19
crook 1 254 19
and 1 254 19
an 1 254 19
economic 1 254 19
Leftist, 1 254 19
who 0 254 19
betrayed 0 254 19
Taiwan 0 254 19
for 0 254 19
the 0 254 19
People’s 0 254 19
Republic; 0 254 19
his 0 254 19
record 0 254 19
certainly 0 254 19
isn’t 0 254 19
good. 0 254 19

Carter? 0 254 20

Nothing 1 254 21
good 1 254 21
can 0 254 21
be 0 254 21
said 0 254 21
about 0 254 21
his 0 254 21
four 0 254 21
years 0 254 21
of 0 254 21
sanctimony 0 254 21
and 0 254 21
incompetence. 0 254 21

But 0 254 22
there 0 254 22
is 0 254 22
one 0 254 22
thing 0 254 22
Barack 0 254 22
Obama 0 254 22
has 0 254 22
on 0 254 22
all 0 254 22
competitors: 0 254 22
treason. 1 254 22

He 0 254 23
showered 0 254 23
hundreds 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
billions 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
dollars 0 254 23
on 0 254 23
the 0 254 23
Islamic 0 254 23
Republic 0 254 23
of 0 254 23
Iran. 0 254 23

There 0 254 24
are 0 254 24
those 0 254 24
who 0 254 24
say, 0 254 24
“It 0 254 24
was 0 254 24
their 0 254 24
money. 0 254 24

It 0 254 25
belonged 0 254 25
to 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Iranian 0 254 25
government 0 254 25
but 0 254 25
was 0 254 25
frozen 0 254 25
and 0 254 25
not 0 254 25
paid 0 254 25
since 0 254 25
1979.” 0 254 25
Indeed, 0 254 25
and 0 254 25
there 0 254 25
was 0 254 25
a 0 254 25
reason 0 254 25
for 0 254 25
that: 0 254 25
not 0 254 25
even 0 254 25
Jimmy 0 254 25
Carter, 0 254 25
who 0 254 25
made 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Islamic 0 254 25
Republic 0 254 25
of 0 254 25
Iran 0 254 25
possible, 0 254 25
thought 0 254 25
that 0 254 25
money, 0 254 25
which 0 254 25
had 0 254 25
been 0 254 25
paid 0 254 25
by 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Shah’s 0 254 25
government 0 254 25
in 0 254 25
a 0 254 25
canceled 0 254 25
arms 0 254 25
deal, 0 254 25
belonged 0 254 25
to 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
mullahs 0 254 25
who 0 254 25
overthrew 0 254 25
the 0 254 25
Shah. 0 254 25

Likewise 0 254 26
Reagan, 0 254 26
George 0 254 26
H. 0 254 26
W. 0 254 26
Bush, 0 254 26
Clinton, 0 254 26
and 0 254 26
George 0 254 26
W. 0 254 26
Bush 0 254 26
all 0 254 26
thought 0 254 26
that 0 254 26
the 0 254 26
Islamic 0 254 26
Republic 0 254 26
was 0 254 26
not 0 254 26
due 0 254 26
money 0 254 26
that 0 254 26
was 0 254 26
owed 0 254 26
to 0 254 26
the 0 254 26
Shah. 0 254 26

Only 0 254 27
Barack 0 254 27
Obama 0 254 27
did. 0 254 27

The 0 254 28
definition 0 254 28
of 0 254 28
treason 1 254 28
is 0 254 28
giving 0 254 28
aid 0 254 28
and 0 254 28
comfort 0 254 28
to 0 254 28
the 0 254 28
enemy. 0 254 28

The 0 254 29
leaders 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
Islamic 0 254 29
Republic 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
Iran 0 254 29
order 0 254 29
their 0 254 29
people 0 254 29
to 0 254 29
chant 0 254 29
“Death 1 254 29
to 1 254 29
America” 1 254 29
in 0 254 29
mosques 0 254 29
every 0 254 29
Friday, 0 254 29
and 0 254 29
repeatedly 0 254 29
vow 0 254 29
that 0 254 29
they 0 254 29
will 0 254 29
ultimately 0 254 29
destroy 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
United 0 254 29
States 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
America 0 254 29
and 0 254 29
the 0 254 29
state 0 254 29
of 0 254 29
Israel. 0 254 29

How 0 254 30
was 0 254 30
giving 0 254 30
them 0 254 30
billions 0 254 30
and 0 254 30
helping 0 254 30
them 0 254 30
skirt 0 254 30
sanctions 0 254 30
applied 0 254 30
by 0 254 30
the 0 254 30
U.S. 0 254 30
government 0 254 30
not 0 254 30
treason? 1 254 30

Other 0 254 31
Presidents 0 254 31
have 0 254 31
been 0 254 31
incompetent, 1 254 31
corrupt, 1 254 31
dishonest, 1 254 31
but 0 254 31
which 0 254 31
has 0 254 31
committed 0 254 31
treason 1 254 31
on 0 254 31
a 0 254 31
scale 0 254 31
to 0 254 31
rival 0 254 31
the 0 254 31
treason 1 254 31
of 0 254 31
Barack 0 254 31
Obama? 0 254 31

The 0 254 32
Iranians 0 254 32
also 0 254 32
operate 0 254 32
a 0 254 32
global 0 254 32
network 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
jihad 0 254 32
terror 0 254 32
organizations, 0 254 32
one 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
which, 0 254 32
Hizballah, 0 254 32
is 0 254 32
quite 0 254 32
active 0 254 32
in 0 254 32
Mexico 0 254 32
now, 0 254 32
with 0 254 32
the 0 254 32
obvious 0 254 32
ultimate 0 254 32
intention 0 254 32
of 0 254 32
crossing 0 254 32
the 0 254 32
border 0 254 32
and 0 254 32
committing 1 254 32
jihad 1 254 32
massacres 1 254 32
of 1 254 32
Americans. 1 254 32

Obama 0 254 33
has 0 254 33
given 0 254 33
a 0 254 33
tremendous 1 254 33
boost 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
these 0 254 33
initiatives, 0 254 33
as 0 254 33
well 0 254 33
as 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
Iran’s 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
program, 0 254 33
with 0 254 33
his 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
deal 0 254 33
that 0 254 33
has 0 254 33
given 0 254 33
the 0 254 33
Iranians 0 254 33
hundreds 0 254 33
of 0 254 33
billions 0 254 33
of 0 254 33
dollars 0 254 33
and 0 254 33
essentially 0 254 33
a 0 254 33
green 0 254 33
light 0 254 33
to 0 254 33
manufacture 0 254 33
nuclear 0 254 33
weapons, 0 254 33
in 0 254 33
exchange 0 254 33
for 0 254 33
absolutely 0 254 33
nothing. 0 254 33

There 0 254 34
is 0 254 34
no 0 254 34
telling 0 254 34
when 0 254 34
the 0 254 34
worst 0 254 34
consequences 0 254 34
of 0 254 34
Obama’s 0 254 34
aid 0 254 34
and 0 254 34
comfort 0 254 34
to 0 254 34
the 0 254 34
Islamic 0 254 34
Republic 0 254 34
of 0 254 34
Iran 0 254 34
will 0 254 34
be 0 254 34
felt. 0 254 34

But 0 254 35
they 0 254 35
likely 0 254 35
will 0 254 35
be 0 254 35
felt 0 254 35
in 0 254 35
one 0 254 35
way 0 254 35
or 0 254 35
another. 0 254 35

Even 0 254 36
as 0 254 36
President 0 254 36
Trump 0 254 36
moves 0 254 36
swiftly 0 254 36
to 0 254 36
restore 0 254 36
sanctions 0 254 36
and 0 254 36
put 0 254 36
Iran 0 254 36
on 0 254 36
notice 0 254 36

that 0 263 10
either 0 263 10
Mr. 0 263 10

The 0 263 19
criticisms 0 263 19
of 0 263 19
Comey's 0 263 19
undisciplined 0 263 19
behavior 0 263 19
was 0 263 19
all 0 263 19
well 0 263 19
and 0 263 19
good, 0 263 19
but 0 263 19
it 0 263 19
was 0 263 19
reasonable 0 263 19
to 0 263 19
expect 0 263 19
something 0 263 19
more 0 263 19
than 0 263 19
the 0 263 19
equivalent 0 263 19

a 0 263 19
half 0 263 19
of 0 263 19
investigation. 0 263 19

Hillary 0 263 20
Clinton’s 0 263 20
supporters 0 263 20
will 0 263 20
no 0 263 20
doubt 0 263 20
jump 0 263 20
on 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
inspector 0 263 20
general’s 0 263 20
criticisms 0 263 20
of 0 263 20
Comey’s 0 263 20
handling 0 263 20
of 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
July 0 263 20
5th 0 263 20
announcement 0 263 20
and 0 263 20
subsequent 0 263 20
letters 0 263 20
as 0 263 20
proof 0 263 20
that 0 263 20
he 0 263 20
improperly 0 263 20
influenced 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
outcome 0 263 20
of 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
election 0 263 20
in 0 263 20
President 0 263 20
Trump’s 0 263 20
favor, 0 263 20
even 0 263 20
if 0 263 20
he 0 263 20
did 0 263 20
not 0 263 20
do 0 263 20
so 0 263 20
deliberately 0 263 20
for 0 263 20
political 0 263 20
reasons. 0 263 20

However, 0 263 21
what 0 263 21
Comey 0 263 21
really 0 263 21
did 0 263 21
was 0 263 21
to 0 263 21
give 1 263 21
Hillary 1 263 21

The 0 263 22
fix 0 263 22
was 0 263 22
in 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
early 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
May 0 263 22
2016, 0 263 22
well 0 263 22
before 0 263 22
the 0 263 22

interviews 0 263 22
of 0 263 22

of 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
many 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
17 0 263 22
other 0 263 22
key 0 263 22
witnesses, 0 263 22
when 0 263 22
Comey 0 263 22
began 0 263 22
the 0 263 22
process 0 263 22
of 0 263 22
drafting 0 263 22
an 0 263 22
exoneration 0 263 22
memo. 0 263 22

Comey’s 0 263 23
initial 0 263 23
draft 0 263 23
statement, 0 263 23
which 0 263 23
he 0 263 23
shared 0 263 23
with 0 263 23
FBI 0 263 23
senior 0 263 23
leadership 0 263 23
on 0 263 23
May 0 263 23
2, 0 263 23
criticized 0 263 23
Clinton’s 0 263 23
handling 0 263 23
of 0 263 23
classified 0 263 23
information 0 263 23
as 0 263 23
“grossly 1 263 23
negligent,” 1 263 23
but 0 263 23
concluded 0 263 23
that 0 263 23
“no 0 263 23
reasonable 0 263 23
prosecutor” 0 263 23
would 0 263 23
bring 0 263 23
a 0 263 23
case 0 263 23
based 0 263 23
on 0 263 23
the 0 263 23
facts 0 263 23
developed 0 263 23
in 0 263 23
the 0 263 23
investigation. 0 263 23

Indeed, 0 263 24
Comey 0 263 24
admitted 0 263 24
in 0 263 24
his 0 263 24
book 0 263 24
that 0 263 24
“we 0 263 24
started 0 263 24
the 0 263 24
Clinton 0 263 24
investigation 0 263 24
aware 0 263 24
that 0 263 24
it 0 263 24
was 0 263 24
unlikely 0 263 24
to 0 263 24
be 0 263 24
a 0 263 24
case 0 263 24
that 0 263 24
career 0 263 24
prosecutors 0 263 24
at 0 263 24
the 0 263 24
Department 0 263 24
of 0 263 24
Justice 0 263 24
would 0 263 24
prosecute.” 0 263 24

If 0 263 25
putting 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
cart 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
exoneration 0 263 25
before 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
horse 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
investigation 0 263 25
were 0 263 25
not 0 263 25
enough, 0 263 25
Comey’s 0 263 25
draft 0 263 25
statement 0 263 25
underwent 0 263 25
various 0 263 25
language 0 263 25
changes 0 263 25
over 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
course 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
next 0 263 25
two 0 263 25
months, 0 263 25
including, 0 263 25
most 0 263 25
importantly, 0 263 25
changing 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
description 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
Clinton’s 0 263 25
handling 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
classified 0 263 25
information 0 263 25
from 0 263 25
“grossly 1 263 25
negligent” 1 263 25
to 0 263 25
“extremely 1 263 25
careless.” 1 263 25
This 0 263 25
change 0 263 25
was 0 263 25
critical 0 263 25
because 0 263 25
“gross 1 263 25
negligence” 1 263 25
is 0 263 25
specifically 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
legal 0 263 25
term 0 263 25
used 0 263 25
in 0 263 25
stating 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
statutory 0 263 25
requirement 0 263 25
in 0 263 25
18 0 263 25

of 0 263 25

conduct. 0 263 25

Comey’s 0 263 26
substitution 0 263 26
of 0 263 26
a 0 263 26
legally 0 263 26
meaningless 0 263 26
phrase, 0 263 26
“extremely 1 263 26
careless,” 1 263 26
for 0 263 26
the 0 263 26
“gross 1 263 26
negligence” 1 263 26
statutory 0 263 26
legal 0 263 26
standard 0 263 26
he 0 263 26
had 0 263 26
originally 0 263 26

of 0 263 26
prejudging 0 263 26
the 0 263 26

in 0 263 26

were 0 263 27

in 0 263 27
the 0 263 27
edits. 0 263 27

Inspector 0 263 28
General 0 263 28
Horowitz 0 263 28
saw 0 263 28
no 0 263 28
problem 0 263 28
with 0 263 28
this 0 263 28
pattern 0 263 28
of 0 263 28
obfuscation 0 263 28
regarding 0 263 28
the 0 263 28
deletion 0 263 28
of 0 263 28
the 0 263 28
legally 0 263 28
significant 0 263 28
phrase 0 263 28
“gross 1 263 28
negligence” 1 263 28
from 0 263 28
Comey’s 0 263 28
statement. 0 263 28

Mr. 0 263 29
Horowitz 0 263 29
relied 0 263 29
in 0 263 29
part 0 263 29
on 0 263 29
opinions 0 263 29
from 0 263 29
prosecutors 0 263 29
that 0 263 29
there 0 263 29
was 0 263 29
not 0 263 29
enough 0 263 29
evidence 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
charge 0 263 29
Clinton 0 263 29
with 0 263 29
acting 0 263 29
in 0 263 29
a 0 263 29
manner 0 263 29
that 0 263 29
rose 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
a 0 263 29
level 0 263 29
of 0 263 29
criminal 0 263 29
gross 1 263 29
negligence 1 263 29
with 0 263 29
respect 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
sending 0 263 29
or 0 263 29
receiving 0 263 29
e-mails 0 263 29
determined 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
contain 0 263 29
classified 0 263 29
information. 0 263 29

Mr. 0 263 30
Horowitz’s 0 263 30
report 0 263 30
thus 0 263 30
concluded, 0 263 30
“We 0 263 30
did 0 263 30
not 0 263 30
identify 0 263 30
evidence 0 263 30
of 0 263 30
bias 0 263 30
or 0 263 30
improper 0 263 30
considerations.” 0 263 30
This 0 263 30
conclusion 0 263 30
defies 0 263 30
common 0 263 30
sense. 0 263 30

Gross 1 263 31
negligence 1 263 31
is 0 263 31
not 0 263 31
the 0 263 31
same 0 263 31
as 0 263 31
willful 0 263 31
intent, 0 263 31
which 0 263 31
Comey 0 263 31
and 0 263 31
his 0 263 31
team 0 263 31
sought 0 263 31
to 0 263 31
conflate 0 263 31
in 0 263 31
exonerating 0 263 31
Hillary 0 263 31
Clinton 0 263 31
before 0 263 31
the 0 263 31
investigation 0 263 31
was 0 263 31
concluded. 0 263 31

Clinton 0 263 32
was 0 263 32
fully 0 263 32
aware 0 263 32
of 0 263 32
what 0 263 32
she 0 263 32
was 0 263 32
doing 0 263 32
when 0 263 32
she 0 263 32
set 0 263 32
up 0 263 32
the 0 263 32
private 0 263 32
server 0 263 32
arrangement 0 263 32
in 0 263 32
the 0 263 32
first 0 263 32
place 0 263 32
and 0 263 32
knowingly 0 263 32
used 0 263 32
it 0 263 32
to 0 263 32
send 0 263 32
and 0 263 32
receive 0 263 32
e-mails 0 263 32
involving 0 263 32
official 0 263 32
government 0 263 32
business, 0 263 32
which 0 263 32
by 0 263 32
their 0 263 32
very 0 263 32
nature 0 263 32
would 0 263 32
be 0 263 32
expected 0 263 32
to 0 263 32
include 0 263 32
classified 0 263 32
information. 0 263 32

It 0 263 33
turns 0 263 33
out 0 263 33
that 0 263 33
some 0 263 33
of 0 263 33
the 0 263 33
e-mails 0 263 33
were 0 263 33
accessed 0 263 33
by 0 263 33
foreign 0 263 33
parties. 0 263 33

Hillary 0 263 34
lied 0 263 34
repeatedly 0 263 34
when 0 263 34
she 0 263 34
first 0 263 34
denied 0 263 34
there 0 263 34
were 0 263 34
any 0 263 34
classified 0 263 34
e-mails 0 263 34
on 0 263 34
her 0 263 34
system 0 263 34
and 0 263 34
then 0 263 34
described 0 263 34
some 0 263 34
of 0 263 34
the 0 263 34
e-mails 0 263 34
involved 0 263 34
in 0 263 34
the 0 263 34
investigation 0 263 34
as 0 263 34
having 0 263 34
been 0 263 34
classified 0 263 34
after 0 263 34
the 0 263 34
fact. 0 263 34

As 0 263 35
Comey 0 263 35
has 0 263 35
admitted, 0 263 35
several 0 263 35
e-mail 0 263 35
chains 0 263 35
concerned 0 263 35
matters 0 263 35
that 0 263 35
were 0 263 35
classified 0 263 35
at 0 263 35
the 0 263 35
Top 0 263 35
Secret/Special 0 263 35
Access 0 263 35
Program 0 263 35
level 0 263 35
when 0 263 35
they 0 263 35
were 0 263 35
sent 0 263 35
and 0 263 35
received 0 263 35
by 0 263 35
Clinton. 0 263 35

Coupled 0 263 36
with 0 263 36
her 0 263 36
agents’ 0 263 36
destruction 0 263 36
of 0 263 36
thousands 0 263 36
of 0 263 36
e-mails 0 263 36
that 0 263 36
had 0 263 36
been 0 263 36
subpoenaed 0 263 36
by 0 263 36
Congress, 0 263 36
Hillary’s 0 263 36
conduct 0 263 36
was 0 263 36
criminally 1 263 36
reckless 1 263 36
at 0 263 36
the 0 263 36
very 0 263 36
least, 0 263 36
if 0 263 36
not 0 263 36
constituting 0 263 36
willful 1 263 36
intent 1 263 36
to 1 263 36
commit 1 263 36
an 1 263 36
act 1 263 36
she 1 263 36
knew 1 263 36
was 1 263 36
wrongful. 1 263 36

Yet 0 263 37
Mr. 0 263 37
Horowitz 0 263 37
saw 0 263 37
no 0 263 37
reason 0 263 37
to 0 263 37
doubt 0 263 37
the 0 263 37
sincerity 0 263 37
of 0 263 37
Comey's 0 263 37
explanations 0 263 37
for 0 263 37
giving 0 263 37
Hillary 0 263 37
a 0 263 37
free 0 263 37
pass. 0 263 37

The 0 263 38
failure 0 263 38
to 0 263 38
at 0 263 38
least 0 263 38
empanel 0 263 38
a 0 263 38
grand 0 263 38
jury 0 263 38
to 0 263 38
compel 0 263 38
testimony 0 263 38
from 0 263 38
Hillary 0 263 38
Clinton 0 263 38
and 0 263 38
key 0 263 38
witnesses 0 263 38
was 0 263 38
itself 0 263 38
a 0 263 38
complete 0 263 38
dereliction 0 263 38
of 0 263 38
duty, 0 263 38
which 0 263 38
could 0 263 38
have 0 263 38
only 0 263 38
been 0 263 38
motivated 0 263 38
by 0 263 38
a 0 263 38

to 0 263 38

Hillary 1 263 38

with 1 263 38
kid 1 263 38
gloves 1 263 38
for 0 263 38
improper 0 263 38
reasons. 0 263 38

Incredibly, 0 263 39
however, 0 263 39
Mr. 0 263 39
Horowitz’s 0 263 39
report 0 263 39
“found 0 263 39
no 0 263 39
persuasive 0 263 39

the 0 263 39
outcome 0 263 39
of 0 263 39

subpoenaed 0 263 39
before 0 263 39
the 0 263 39
grand 0 263 39
jury.” 0 263 39

Mr. 0 263 40
Horowitz 0 263 40
also 0 263 40
did 0 263 40
not 0 263 40
deem 0 263 40
Comey’s 0 263 40
possible 0 263 40
perjury 0 263 40
in 0 263 40
his 0 263 40
testimony 0 263 40
before 0 263 40
Congress 0 263 40
to 0 263 40
be 0 263 40
an 0 263 40
appropriate 0 263 40
subject 0 263 40
for 0 263 40
criminal 0 263 40
referral. 0 263 40

Comey 0 263 41
testified 0 263 41
that 0 263 41
his 0 263 41
decision 0 263 41
to 0 263 41
exonerate 0 263 41
Hillary 0 263 41

made 0 263 41
before 0 263 41
her 0 263 41

all 0 263 41
intents 0 263 41
and 0 263 41
purposes 0 263 41
it 0 263 41
was. 0 263 41

Mr. 0 263 42
Horowitz 0 263 42
simply 0 263 42
took 0 263 42
Comey’s 0 263 42
word 0 263 42
for 0 263 42
what 0 263 42
he 0 263 42
had 0 263 42
meant. 0 263 42

Inspector 0 263 43

over 0 263 43

discussed 0 263 44
in 0 263 44

mostly 0 263 44
in 0 263 44
the 0 263 44
context 0 263 44
of 0 263 44
how 0 263 44
it 0 263 44

all 0 263 45
Mr. 0 263 45
Horowitz’s 0 263 45
report 0 263 45
had 0 263 45
to 0 263 45
say 0 263 45
was 0 263 45
that 0 263 45
it 0 263 45
was 0 263 45
“an 0 263 45
error 0 263 45
in 0 263 45
judgment.” 0 263 45

The 0 263 46
OIG 0 263 46

also 0 263 46
criticized 0 263 46
the 0 263 46

of 0 263 46
Peter 0 263 46
Strzok 0 263 46

sharply 1 263 46
critical 1 263 46
of 1 263 46
Mr. 1 263 46
Trump 1 263 46
before 0 263 46
and 0 263 46
after 0 263 46
the 0 263 46

for 0 263 46
casting 0 263 46
“a 0 263 46

The 0 263 46

a 0 263 46

on 0 263 46
August 0 263 46
8, 0 263 46
2016, 0 263 46
in 0 263 46
which 0 263 46
Strzok 0 263 46
reassured 0 263 46
Page 0 263 46
that 0 263 46
she 0 263 46
need 0 263 46
not 0 263 46

about 0 263 46
Donald 0 263 46

Strzok. 0 263 49

“No. 0 263 50

We’ll 0 263 52
stop 0 263 52
it,” 0 263 52
Strzok 0 263 52
responded. 0 263 52

Mr. 0 263 53
Horowitz 0 263 53
wrote 0 263 53
that 0 263 53
this 0 263 53
exchange 0 263 53
was 0 263 53
“not 0 263 53
only 0 263 53
indicative 0 263 53
of 0 263 53
a 0 263 53
biased 0 263 53
state 0 263 53
of 0 263 53
mind 0 263 53
but, 0 263 53
even 0 263 53
more 0 263 53
seriously, 0 263 53
implies 0 263 53
a 0 263 53
willingness 0 263 53
to 0 263 53
take 0 263 53

impact 0 263 53
the 0 263 53
presidential 0 263 53
candidate’s 0 263 53
electoral 0 263 53
prospects.” 0 263 53
The 0 263 53
inspector 0 263 53
general 0 263 53
questioned 0 263 53
whether 0 263 53
Strzok’s 0 263 53
decision 0 263 53
to 0 263 53
prioritize 0 263 53
the 0 263 53
Russia 0 263 53

investigation 0 263 53
over 0 263 53

discovered 0 263 53
on 0 263 53
the 0 263 53

was 0 263 53
free 0 263 53

Ultimately, 0 263 54
however, 0 263 54
he 0 263 54
inexplicably 1 263 54
concluded 1 263 54
that 0 263 54
there 0 263 54
was 0 263 54
no 0 263 54

We 0 273 32
used 0 273 32
to 0 273 32

that 0 273 32

the 1 273 32

heresy, 1 273 32
and 1 273 32
their 1 273 32
historical 1 273 32

This 0 273 33
is, 0 273 33
indeed, 0 273 33
a 0 273 33
new 0 273 33
fashion. 1 273 33

Some 0 273 34
esteemed 0 273 34

Anybody? 0 273 35

The 1 273 36

claim 1 273 36
that 1 273 36
it 1 273 36
happened 1 273 36
to 1 273 36
them 1 273 36

that 1 273 36

What 1 273 37
we 1 273 37
have 1 273 37
here 1 273 37
are 1 273 37
historical 1 273 37
errors. 1 273 37

First 0 273 38
of 0 273 38
all, 0 273 38
the 0 273 38
figure 0 273 38
of 0 273 38
six 0 273 38
million 0 273 38
is 0 273 38

did 0 273 42
Hitler 0 273 42

The 0 295 0
truth 0 295 0
about 0 295 0
Trump, 0 295 0
Putin, 0 295 0
and 0 295 0
Obama 0 295 0

President 0 295 1
Trump’s 0 295 1
summit 0 295 1
Monday 0 295 1
with 0 295 1
Russian 0 295 1
President 0 295 1
Vladimir 0 295 1
Putin 0 295 1
in 0 295 1
Helsinki 0 295 1
created 0 295 1
a 0 295 1
firestorm 1 295 1
of 0 295 1
controversy. 0 295 1

President 0 295 2
Trump 0 295 2
seemed 0 295 2
to 0 295 2
be 0 295 2
publicly 0 295 2
siding 0 295 2
with 0 295 2
the 0 295 2
Russian 1 295 2
dictator 1 295 2
against 0 295 2
the 0 295 2
American 0 295 2
intelligence 0 295 2
agencies. 0 295 2

The 0 295 3
initial 0 295 3
appearance 0 295 3
was 0 295 3
so 0 295 3
bad 1 295 3
that 0 295 3
I 0 295 3
tweeted: 0 295 3
“President 0 295 3
Trump 0 295 3
must 0 295 3
clarify 0 295 3
his 0 295 3
statements 0 295 3
in 0 295 3
Helsinki 0 295 3
on 0 295 3
our 0 295 3
intelligence 0 295 3
system 0 295 3
and 0 295 3
Putin. 0 295 3

It 0 295 4
is 0 295 4
the 1 295 4
most 1 295 4
serious 1 295 4
mistake 0 295 4
of 0 295 4
his 0 295 4
presidency 0 295 4
and 0 295 4
must 0 295 4
be 0 295 4
corrected 0 295 4
– 0 295 4
immediately.” 0 295 4

After 0 295 5
flying 0 295 5
home 0 295 5
from 0 295 5
Helsinki 0 295 5
and 0 295 5
reviewing 0 295 5
the 0 295 5
tape 0 295 5
and 0 295 5
transcript 0 295 5
of 0 295 5
his 0 295 5
press 0 295 5
conference 0 295 5
with 0 295 5
Putin, 0 295 5
President 0 295 5
Trump 0 295 5
said 0 295 5
he 0 295 5
has 0 295 5
“full 0 295 5
faith 0 295 5
and 0 295 5
support 0 295 5
for 0 295 5
America’s 1 295 5
great 1 295 5
intelligence 1 295 5
agencies” 1 295 5
and 0 295 5
that 0 295 5
he 0 295 5
accepts 0 295 5
“our 0 295 5
intelligence 0 295 5
community’s 0 295 5
conclusion 0 295 5
that 0 295 5
Russia’s 0 295 5
meddling 0 295 5
in 0 295 5
the 0 295 5
2016 0 295 5
election 0 295 5
took 0 295 5
place.” 0 295 5

In 0 295 6
his 0 295 6
remarks 0 295 6
to 0 295 6
members 0 295 6
of 0 295 6
Congress 0 295 6
Tuesday 0 295 6
that 0 295 6
were 0 295 6
televised 0 295 6
by 0 295 6
the 0 295 6
media, 0 295 6
President 0 295 6
Trump 0 295 6
went 0 295 6
on 0 295 6
to 0 295 6
admit 0 295 6
that 0 295 6
he 0 295 6
realized 0 295 6
he 0 295 6
needed 0 295 6
to 0 295 6
clarify 0 295 6
his 0 295 6
statements 0 295 6
in 0 295 6
Helsinki. 0 295 6

The 0 295 7
president 0 295 7
said: 0 295 7
“It 0 295 7
should 0 295 7
have 0 295 7
been 0 295 7
obvious 0 295 7
– 0 295 7
I 0 295 7
thought 0 295 7
it 0 295 7
would 0 295 7
be 0 295 7
obvious 0 295 7
– 0 295 7
but 0 295 7
I 0 295 7
would 0 295 7
like 0 295 7
to 0 295 7
clarify, 0 295 7
just 0 295 7
in 0 295 7
case 0 295 7
it 0 295 7
wasn’t. 0 295 7

In 0 295 8
a 0 295 8
key 0 295 8
sentence 0 295 8
in 0 295 8
my 0 295 8
remarks, 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
said 0 295 8
the 0 295 8
word 0 295 8
‘would’ 0 295 8
instead 0 295 8
of 0 295 8
“wouldn’t.” 0 295 8
The 0 295 8
sentence 0 295 8
should 0 295 8
have 0 295 8
been: 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
don’t 0 295 8
see 0 295 8
any 0 295 8
reason 0 295 8
why 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
wouldn’t 0 295 8
– 0 295 8
or 0 295 8
why 0 295 8
it 0 295 8
wouldn’t 0 295 8
be 0 295 8
Russia. 0 295 8

So 0 295 9
just 0 295 9
to 0 295 9
repeat 0 295 9
it, 0 295 9
I 0 295 9
said 0 295 9
the 0 295 9
word 0 295 9
‘would’ 0 295 9
instead 0 295 9
of 0 295 9
‘wouldn’t’ 0 295 9
… 0 295 9

“I 0 295 10
have, 0 295 10
on 0 295 10
numerous 0 295 10
occasions, 0 295 10
noted 0 295 10
our 0 295 10
intelligence 0 295 10
findings 0 295 10
that 0 295 10
Russians 0 295 10
attempted 0 295 10
to 0 295 10
interfere 0 295 10
in 0 295 10
our 1 295 10
elections. 0 295 10

Unlike 0 295 11
previous 0 295 11
administrations, 0 295 11
my 0 295 11
administration 0 295 11
has 0 295 11
and 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
continue 0 295 11
to 0 295 11
move 0 295 11
aggressively 1 295 11
to 0 295 11
repeal 0 295 11
any 0 295 11
efforts 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
and 0 295 11
repel 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
we 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
stop 0 295 11
it, 0 295 11
we 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
repel 0 295 11
it 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
any 0 295 11
efforts 0 295 11
to 0 295 11
interfere 0 295 11
in 0 295 11
our 1 295 11
elections. 0 295 11

We’re 0 295 12
doing 0 295 12
everything 0 295 12
in 0 295 12
our 1 295 12
power 0 295 12
to 0 295 12
prevent 0 295 12
Russian 0 295 12
interference 0 295 12
in 0 295 12
2018.” 0 295 12

Anyone 0 295 13
who 0 295 13
has 0 295 13
studied 0 295 13
President 0 295 13
Trump 0 295 13
knows 0 295 13
he 0 295 13
hates 0 295 13
to 0 295 13
admit 0 295 13
a 0 295 13
mistake. 0 295 13

His 0 295 14
natural 0 295 14
pattern 0 295 14
is 0 295 14
to 0 295 14
move 0 295 14
forward 0 295 14
and 0 295 14
ignore 0 295 14
mistakes. 0 295 14

For 0 295 15
him, 0 295 15
this 0 295 15
was 0 295 15
a 0 295 15
big 0 295 15
correction 0 295 15
(and 0 295 15
as 0 295 15
I 0 295 15
noted 0 295 15
the 0 295 15
day 0 295 15
before, 0 295 15
it 0 295 15
was 0 295 15
an 0 295 15
absolutely 0 295 15
necessary 0 295 15
one). 0 295 15

President 1 295 16
Trump 1 295 16
then 1 295 16
reminded 1 295 16
everyone 1 295 16
of 1 295 16
the 1 295 16
Obama 1 295 16
administration’s 1 295 16
failures 1 295 16
in 1 295 16
dealing 1 295 16
with 1 295 16
Russian 1 295 16
meddling 1 295 16
in 1 295 16
the 1 295 16
election. 1 295 16

President 0 295 17
Trump 0 295 17
noted 0 295 17
that 0 295 17
President 0 295 17
Obama 0 295 17
and 0 295 17
his 0 295 17
advisers 0 295 17
had 0 295 17
information 0 295 17
that 0 295 17
the 0 295 17
Russians 0 295 17
had 0 295 17
been 0 295 17
working 0 295 17
to 0 295 17
interfere 0 295 17
in 0 295 17
the 0 295 17
election 0 295 17
and 0 295 17
they 0 295 17
ignored 0 295 17
it, 0 295 17
because 1 295 17
they 1 295 17
thought 1 295 17
Hillary 1 295 17
Clinton 1 295 17
was 1 295 17
going 1 295 17
to 1 295 17
win. 1 295 17

President 0 295 18
Trump 0 295 18
said: 0 295 18
“President 0 295 18
Obama, 0 295 18
along 0 295 18
with 0 295 18
(then-CIA 0 295 18
Director 0 295 18
John) 0 295 18
Brennan 0 295 18

Clapper 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
the 0 295 18
whole 0 295 18
group 0 295 18
that 0 295 18
you 0 295 18
see 0 295 18
on 0 295 18
television 0 295 18
now 0 295 18
– 0 295 18
probably 0 295 18
getting 0 295 18
paid 0 295 18
a 0 295 18
lot 0 295 18
of 0 295 18
money 0 295 18
by 0 295 18
your 0 295 18
networks 0 295 18
– 0 295 18
they 0 295 18
knew 0 295 18
about 0 295 18
Russia’s 0 295 18
attempt 0 295 18
to 0 295 18
interfere 0 295 18
in 0 295 18
the 0 295 18
election 0 295 18
in 0 295 18
September, 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
they 0 295 18
totally 0 295 18
buried 0 295 18
it. 0 295 18

And 0 295 19
as 0 295 19
I 0 295 19
said, 0 295 19
they 0 295 19
buried 0 295 19
it 0 295 19
because 1 295 19
they 1 295 19
thought 1 295 19
that 1 295 19
Hillary 1 295 19
Clinton 1 295 19
was 1 295 19
going 1 295 19
to 1 295 19
win. 1 295 19

It 0 295 20
turned 0 295 20
out 0 295 20
it 0 295 20
didn’t 0 295 20
happen 0 295 20
that 0 295 20
way. 0 295 20

“By 0 295 21
contrast, 0 295 21
my 0 295 21
administration 0 295 21
has 0 295 21
taken 0 295 21
a 0 295 21
very 0 295 21
firm 0 295 21
stance 0 295 21
– 0 295 21
it’s 1 295 21
a 1 295 21
very 1 295 21
firm 1 295 21
stance 1 295 21
– 0 295 21
on 0 295 21
a 0 295 21
strong 0 295 21
action. 0 295 21

We’re 0 295 22
going 0 295 22
to 0 295 22
take 0 295 22
strong 1 295 22
action 1 295 22
to 0 295 22
secure 0 295 22
our 0 295 22
election 0 295 22
systems 0 295 22
and 0 295 22
the 0 295 22
process.” 0 295 22

There 0 295 23
are 0 295 23
two 0 295 23
key 0 295 23
facts 0 295 23
in 0 295 23
this 0 295 23
statement. 0 295 23

First, 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
very 0 295 24
people 0 295 24
who 0 295 24
have 0 295 24
been 0 295 24
loudest 1 295 24
in 0 295 24
attacking 0 295 24
President 0 295 24
Trump 0 295 24
about 0 295 24
his 0 295 24
performance 0 295 24
at 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
Helsinki 0 295 24
summit 0 295 24
are 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
people 0 295 24
who 0 295 24
failed 0 295 24
to 0 295 24
protect 0 295 24
America 0 295 24
from 0 295 24
Russian 0 295 24
meddling 0 295 24
in 0 295 24
2016. 0 295 24

The 1 295 25
very 1 295 25
intensity 0 295 25
and 0 295 25
nastiness 1 295 25
of 0 295 25
former 0 295 25
CIA 0 295 25
Director 0 295 25
Brennan 0 295 25
and 0 295 25
former 0 295 25
Director 0 295 25
of 0 295 25
National 0 295 25
Intelligence 0 295 25
Clapper 0 295 25
is 0 295 25
an 0 295 25
attempt 0 295 25
to 0 295 25
distract 0 295 25
attention 0 295 25
from 0 295 25
their 0 295 25
failure 0 295 25
to 1 295 25
protect 1 295 25
America. 1 295 25

It 0 295 26
was 0 295 26
their 0 295 26
duty 0 295 26
in 0 295 26
2016 0 295 26
– 0 295 26
not 0 295 26
candidate 0 295 26
Trump’s. 0 295 26

Second, 0 295 27
the 0 295 27
Trump 0 295 27
administration 0 295 27
has 0 295 27
been 0 295 27
far 0 295 27
tougher 0 295 27
on 0 295 27
Russia 0 295 27
than 0 295 27
President 0 295 27
Obama 0 295 27
ever 0 295 27
dreamed 0 295 27
of 0 295 27
being. 0 295 27

The 1 295 28
Trump 1 295 28
administration 1 295 28
is 0 295 28
taking 0 295 28
real 0 295 28
actions 0 295 28
designed 0 295 28
to 0 295 28
weaken 0 295 28
Russia 0 295 28
and 0 295 28
force 0 295 28
Putin 0 295 28
to 0 295 28
change 0 295 28
his 0 295 28
aggressive 1 295 28
behavior. 0 295 28

The 1 295 29
Trump 1 295 29
administration 1 295 29
has 0 295 29
levied 0 295 29
tough 0 295 29
sanctions 0 295 29
on 0 295 29
Russia. 0 295 29

Also, 0 295 30
President 0 295 30
Trump’s 0 295 30
public 0 295 30
lecture 0 295 30
about 0 295 30
Germany 0 295 30
not 0 295 30
buying 0 295 30
natural 0 295 30
gas 0 295 30
from 0 295 30
Russia 0 295 30
was 0 295 30
aimed 0 295 30

100 0 295 38
Russian 0 295 38

Despite 0 295 39
the 0 295 39
hysteria 0 295 39
of 0 295 39
the 0 295 39
left, 0 295 39
it 0 295 39
is 0 295 39
impossible 0 295 39
to 0 295 39

as 0 295 39
anything 0 295 39

Nothing 0 295 40

war 0 295 42
in 0 295 42
which 0 295 42
the 0 295 42

sees 0 295 42
itself 0 295 42
losing. 0 295 42

This 0 295 43
is 0 295 43

more. 0 295 43

With 0 295 44
President 0 295 44
Trump’s 0 295 44
nomination 0 295 44
of 0 295 44
Judge 0 295 44
Brett 0 295 44
Kavanaugh 0 295 44
to 0 295 44
the 0 295 44
Supreme 0 295 44
Court, 0 295 44
it 0 295 44
was 0 295 44
clear 0 295 44
that 0 295 44
anyone 0 295 44
Trump 0 295 44
nominated 0 295 44
was 0 295 44
going 0 295 44
to 0 295 44
be 0 295 44
attacked. 0 295 44

In 0 295 45
fact, 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
demonstrators 0 295 45
protesting 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
nomination 0 295 45
had 0 295 45
signs 0 295 45
for 0 295 45
all 0 295 45
four 0 295 45
of 0 295 45
the 0 295 45

were 0 295 45
instantly 0 295 45
ready 0 295 45
to 0 295 45
oppose 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
president 0 295 45
regardless 0 295 45
of 0 295 45
his 0 295 45

Similarly, 0 295 46
Obama-era 0 295 46
national 0 295 46
security 0 295 46
officials 0 295 46
seem 0 295 46
determined 0 295 46
to 0 295 46
use 0 295 46
the 0 295 46
harshest 1 295 46
possible 1 295 46
language 0 295 46
to 0 295 46
attack 0 295 46
President 0 295 46
Trump. 0 295 46

I 0 295 47
think 0 295 47
their 0 295 47
strong 0 295 47
words 0 295 47
and 0 295 47
hysteria 1 295 47
are 0 295 47
driven 1 295 47
by 1 295 47
their 1 295 47
own 1 295 47
guilt. 1 295 47

Whatever 0 295 48
the 0 295 48
Russians 0 295 48
did, 0 295 48
they 0 295 48
did 0 295 48
while 0 295 48
Brennan 0 295 48

director 0 295 48

James 0 295 48

the 0 295 48
Federal 0 295 48
Bureau 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
Investigation. 0 295 48

These 0 295 49
former 0 295 49
officials 0 295 49
attack 0 295 49
Trump 0 295 49
ferociously 1 295 49
to 0 295 49
hide 0 295 49
their 0 295 49
own 0 295 49
failure 0 295 49
and 0 295 49
their 0 295 49
own 0 295 49
guilt. 0 295 49

Just 0 295 50
keep 0 295 50
that 0 295 50
in 0 295 50

the 0 295 50

is 0 295 50

that 0 295 50

President 0 295 50

The 0 297 27

Department’s 0 297 27
recent 0 297 27
settlement 0 297 27
with 0 297 27

very 0 297 27
favorable 0 297 27

it 1 297 28
will 1 297 28
be 1 297 28
difficult, 1 297 28
if 1 297 28
not 1 297 28
impossible, 1 297 28
for 0 297 28
the 0 297 28
government 0 297 28
to 0 297 28
regulate 0 297 28
either 0 297 28
the 0 297 28
printers 0 297 28
or 0 297 28
the 0 297 28
guns 0 297 28
that 0 297 28
are 0 297 28
made 0 297 28
with 0 297 28
them. 0 297 28

How 0 297 29
the 0 297 29
government 0 297 29
will 0 297 29
stop 0 297 29
people 0 297 29
from 0 297 29
obtaining 0 297 29
these 0 297 29
printers 0 297 29
isn’t 0 297 29
exactly 0 297 29
obvious. 0 297 29

Proposals 0 297 30
to 0 297 30
require 0 297 30
background 0 297 30
checks, 0 297 30
mandatory 0 297 30
serial 0 297 30
numbers 0 297 30

even 0 297 30
a 0 297 30
registration 0 297 30
process 0 297 30
for 0 297 30
printers 0 297 30
are 0 297 30
easily 0 297 30
defeated. 0 297 30

Even 0 297 31
if 0 297 31
printers 0 297 31
are 0 297 31
registered 0 297 31
with 0 297 31
the 0 297 31
government, 0 297 31
what 0 297 31
is 0 297 31
going 0 297 31
to 0 297 31
stop 0 297 31
gangs 0 297 31
from 0 297 31
stealing 0 297 31
them? 0 297 31

And 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
designs 0 297 32
for 0 297 32
making 0 297 32
your 0 297 32
own 0 297 32
printer 0 297 32
have 0 297 32
been 0 297 32
available 0 297 32
on 0 297 32
the 0 297 32
Internet 0 297 32
for 0 297 32
years. 0 297 32

3D 0 297 33
printers 0 297 33
make 1 297 33
the 1 297 33
already 1 297 33
extremely 1 297 33
difficult 1 297 33
job 1 297 33
of 1 297 33
controlling 1 297 33
access 1 297 33
to 1 297 33
guns 1 297 33
practically 1 297 33
impossible. 1 297 33

The 0 297 34
government 0 297 34
is 0 297 34
not 0 297 34
going 0 297 34
to 0 297 34
be 0 297 34
able 0 297 34
to 0 297 34
ban 0 297 34
guns, 0 297 34
and 0 297 34
limits 0 297 34
on 0 297 34
the 0 297 34
size 0 297 34
of 0 297 34
bullet 0 297 34
magazines 0 297 34
will 0 297 34
be 0 297 34
even 1 297 34
more 1 297 34
laughable 1 297 34
than 0 297 34
before. 0 297 34

Many 0 297 35
parts 0 297 35
of 0 297 35
a 0 297 35
gun 0 297 35
can 0 297 35
be 0 297 35
made 0 297 35
on 0 297 35
very 0 297 35
inexpensive, 0 297 35
plastic 0 297 35
3D 0 297 35
printers 0 297 35
or 0 297 35
even 0 297 35
from 0 297 35
simple 0 297 35
machine 0 297 35
tools. 0 297 35

It 0 297 36
will 0 297 36
be 0 297 36
even 0 297 36
more 0 297 36
difficult 0 297 36
to 0 297 36
impose 0 297 36
background 0 297 36
checks, 0 297 36
which 1 297 36
have 1 297 36
proven 1 297 36
quite 1 297 36
useless 1 297 36
anyway. 1 297 36

The 1 297 37
government 1 297 37
has 1 297 37
been 1 297 37
no 1 297 37
more 1 297 37
effective 1 297 37
at 1 297 37
stopping 1 297 37
criminals 1 297 37
from 1 297 37
getting 1 297 37
guns 1 297 37
than 1 297 37
at 1 297 37
stopping 1 297 37
them 1 297 37
from 1 297 37
obtaining 1 297 37
drugs. 1 297 37

That 0 297 38
isn’t 0 297 38
too 0 297 38
surprising, 0 297 38
as 0 297 38
drug 0 297 38
gangs 0 297 38
are 0 297 38
the 0 297 38
source 0 297 38
of 0 297 38
both 0 297 38
illegal 0 297 38
drugs 0 297 38
and 0 297 38
guns. 0 297 38

This 0 297 39
was 0 297 39
a 0 297 39
tough 0 297 39
battle 0 297 39
for 0 297 39
the 0 297 39
plaintiff's, 0 297 39
SAF 0 297 39
and 0 297 39
DD. 0 297 39

They 0 297 40
lost 0 297 40
many 0 297 40
lower 0 297 40
court 0 297 40
rulings. 0 297 40

Gun-control 0 297 41
advocates 0 297 41
believe 0 297 41
that 0 297 41
the 1 297 41
government 1 297 41
"capitulated" 1 297 41
too 0 297 41
soon. 0 297 41

the 1 297 42

“capitulated 1 297 42

every 0 297 42
step 0 297 42
of 0 297 42
the 0 297 42
way. 0 297 42

This 1 297 43
isn’t 1 297 43
a 1 297 43
case 1 297 43
where 1 297 43
the 1 297 43

facts 1 297 43
of 1 297 43
the 1 297 43

The 1 297 44
only 1 297 44
thing 1 297 44
that 1 297 44
changed 1 297 44
was 1 297 44
the 1 297 44

The 0 297 45
concept 0 297 45
of 0 297 45
making 0 297 45
guns 0 297 45
with 0 297 45
3D 0 297 45

render 0 297 45
much 0 297 45
technology 0 297 45
obsolete 0 297 45

an 0 297 48

Pilger: 0 316 2
His 0 316 2
state 0 316 2
of 0 316 2
health 0 316 2
is 0 316 2
just 0 316 2
about 0 316 2
the 0 316 2
same, 0 316 2
as 0 316 2
I 0 316 2
understand 0 316 2
it. 0 316 2

He 0 316 3
needs 0 316 3
medical 0 316 3
attention, 0 316 3
the 0 316 3
kind 0 316 3
of 0 316 3
treatment 0 316 3
you 0 316 3
get 0 316 3
only 0 316 3
in 0 316 3
a 0 316 3
hospital. 0 316 3

But 0 316 4
it 0 316 4
has 0 316 4
been 0 316 4
made 0 316 4
clear 0 316 4
to 0 316 4
him 0 316 4
that 0 316 4
if 0 316 4

to 0 316 4
go 0 316 4
to 0 316 4
a 0 316 4

he 0 316 4

not 0 316 4
be 0 316 4
given 0 316 4
free 0 316 4

His 0 316 6

the 1 316 6

behalf 1 316 7
of 1 316 7
its 1 316 7
citizen. 1 316 7

We 1 316 8
must 1 316 8
ask 1 316 8
ourselves 1 316 8
why 1 316 8
this 1 316 8
hasn’t 1 316 8
happened. 1 316 8

My 0 316 9
own 0 316 9
feeling 0 316 9
is 0 316 9
that 0 316 9
there 0 316 9
is 0 316 9
a 0 316 9
great 0 316 9
deal 0 316 9
of 0 316 9
collusion 0 316 9
between 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
Australian, 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
British 0 316 9
and 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
US 0 316 9
governments–meant 0 316 9
to 0 316 9
close 0 316 9
down 0 316 9
WikiLeaks 0 316 9
completely 0 316 9
and/or 0 316 9
deliver 0 316 9
Julian 0 316 9
Assange 0 316 9
to 0 316 9
the 0 316 9
Americans. 0 316 9

Recently 0 316 10
the 0 316 10
Australian 0 316 10
foreign 0 316 10
minister, 0 316 10
Julie 0 316 10
Bishop, 0 316 10
traveled 0 316 10
with 0 316 10
senior 0 316 10
officials 0 316 10
to 0 316 10
London 0 316 10
and 0 316 10
to 0 316 10
Washington 0 316 10
and 0 316 10
raised 0 316 10
the 0 316 10
whole 0 316 10
matter 0 316 10
of 0 316 10
Julian. 0 316 10

But 0 316 11
they 0 316 11
raised 0 316 11
it 0 316 11
in 0 316 11
a 0 316 11
way 0 316 11
that 0 316 11
didn’t 0 316 11
support 0 316 11
the 0 316 11
idea 0 316 11
that 0 316 11
a 0 316 11
government 0 316 11
should 0 316 11
represent 0 316 11
its 0 316 11
citizens. 0 316 11

These 0 316 12
people 0 316 12
listened 0 316 12
to 0 316 12
the 0 316 12
more 0 316 12
powerful 0 316 12
governments. 0 316 12

In 0 316 13
Washington 0 316 13
they 0 316 13
met 0 316 13
Mr. 0 316 13
Pompeo, 0 316 13
who 0 316 13
refused 0 316 13
to 0 316 13
discuss 0 316 13
Assange 0 316 13
altogether. 0 316 13

I 0 316 14
think 0 316 14
there 0 316 14
is 0 316 14
collusion 0 316 14
which 0 316 14
amounts 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
an 0 316 14
attempt 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
try 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
do 0 316 14
a 0 316 14
deal 0 316 14
with 0 316 14
Assange 0 316 14
whereby 0 316 14
he 0 316 14
might 0 316 14
be 0 316 14
allowed 0 316 14
free 0 316 14
passage 0 316 14
of 0 316 14
return 0 316 14
to 0 316 14
Australia 0 316 14
if 0 316 14
he 0 316 14
shuts 0 316 14
down 0 316 14
WikiLeaks. 0 316 14

I 0 316 15
think 0 316 15
that 0 316 15
is 0 316 15
very, 0 316 15
very 0 316 15
likely. 0 316 15

As 0 316 16
I 0 316 16
understand 0 316 16
Julian, 0 316 16
this 0 316 16
is 0 316 16
something 1 316 16
he 1 316 16
would 1 316 16
not 1 316 16
even 1 316 16
contemplate. 1 316 16

But 0 316 17
that 0 316 17
might 0 316 17
be 0 316 17
one 0 316 17
of 0 316 17
the 0 316 17
so-called 0 316 17
“wretched 1 316 17
deals” 1 316 17
that 0 316 17
are 0 316 17
being 0 316 17
offered 0 316 17
Assange. 0 316 17

Some 0 316 18
very 0 316 18
strange 0 316 18
things 0 316 18
are 0 316 18
being 0 316 18
said 0 316 18
by 0 316 18
senior 0 316 18
members 0 316 18
of 0 316 18
these 0 316 18
two 0 316 18
governments. 0 316 18

The 0 316 19
new 0 316 19
foreign 0 316 19
secretary 0 316 19
of 0 316 19
the 0 316 19
United 0 316 19
Kingdom, 0 316 19
Jeremy 0 316 19
Hunt, 0 316 19
said 0 316 19
sarcastically 0 316 19
that 0 316 19
the 1 316 19
British 1 316 19
police 1 316 19
would 1 316 19
offer 1 316 19
Julian 1 316 19
“a 1 316 19
warm 1 316 19
welcome” 1 316 19
when 1 316 19
he 1 316 19
came 1 316 19
out, 1 316 19
when 0 316 19
he 0 316 19
would 0 316 19
face 0 316 19
serious 0 316 19
charges. 0 316 19

There 0 316 20
are 0 316 20
no 0 316 20
serious 0 316 20
charges. 0 316 20

He 0 316 21
hasn’t 0 316 21
been 0 316 21
charged 0 316 21
with 0 316 21
anything. 0 316 21

Was 0 316 23

to 0 316 23
a 0 316 23
deal 0 316 23

I 0 316 24
don’t 0 316 24
know. 0 316 24

But 0 316 25
this 0 316 25
is 0 316 25
the 1 316 25
milieu 1 316 25
of 1 316 25
machination 1 316 25
around 0 316 25
someone 0 316 25

Putting 1 316 26
aside 1 316 26
freedom 1 316 26
of 1 316 26

the 1 316 26
persecution 1 316 26
of 1 316 26
this 1 316 26
man 1 316 26
has 1 316 26
been 1 316 26
something 1 316 26
that 1 316 26
should 1 316 26
horrify 1 316 26
all 1 316 26
free-thinking 1 316 26
people. 1 316 26

If 1 316 27
it 1 316 27
doesn’t 1 316 27
horrify 1 316 27
us, 1 316 27
then 1 316 27
we 1 316 27

John, 0 316 29
I 0 316 29
would 0 316 29
like 0 316 29
you 0 316 29
to 0 316 29
explain 0 316 29
once 0 316 29
again 0 316 29
why 0 316 29
Julian 0 316 29
Assange 0 316 29
is 0 316 29
such 1 316 29
a 1 316 29
significant 1 316 29
journalist, 1 316 29
why 0 316 29
so 0 316 29
many 0 316 29
journalistic 0 316 29
institutions 0 316 29
have 0 316 29
collaborated 0 316 29

him 0 316 29
based 0 316 29
on 0 316 29
the 0 316 29
information 0 316 29
he 0 316 29
provided. 0 316 29

We 0 316 30
are 0 316 30
talking 0 316 30
about 0 316 30
a 1 316 30
publisher 1 316 30
and 1 316 30
reporter 1 316 30
who 1 316 30
has 1 316 30
changed 1 316 30
history. 1 316 30

JP: 0 316 31
Nothing 1 316 31
in 1 316 31
my 1 316 31
time 1 316 31
as 1 316 31
a 1 316 31
journalist 1 316 31
has 1 316 31
equaled 1 316 31
the 1 316 31
rise 1 316 31
of 1 316 31
WikiLeaks 1 316 31
and 1 316 31
its 1 316 31
extraordinary 1 316 31
impact 1 316 31
on 1 316 31
journalism. 1 316 31

It 0 316 32
is 0 316 32
probably 0 316 32
the 1 316 32
only 1 316 32
journalistic 1 316 32
organization 1 316 32
that 1 316 32
has 1 316 32
a 1 316 32
100% 1 316 32
record 1 316 32
of 1 316 32
accuracy 1 316 32
and 1 316 32
authenticity! 1 316 32

All 0 316 33
of 0 316 33
WikiLeaks’ 0 316 33
revelations 0 316 33
have 0 316 33
been 0 316 33
authentic. 0 316 33

And 0 316 34
it 0 316 34
has 0 316 34
been 0 316 34
done 0 316 34
“without 0 316 34
fear 0 316 34
or 0 316 34
favor.” 0 316 34
Although 0 316 34
there 0 316 34
has 0 316 34
been 0 316 34
a 0 316 34
concentration 0 316 34
on, 0 316 34
say, 0 316 34
the 0 316 34
release 0 316 34
of 0 316 34
the 0 316 34
Hillary 0 316 34
Clinton/Podesta 0 316 34
emails, 0 316 34

the 0 316 34
Iraq 0 316 34

Afghan 0 316 34
war 0 316 34
logs, 0 316 34
WikiLeaks 0 316 34
has 0 316 34
released 0 316 34
information 0 316 34
that 0 316 34
people 0 316 34
have 0 316 34
a 0 316 34
right 0 316 34
to 0 316 34
know 0 316 34
across 0 316 34
the 0 316 34
spectrum. 0 316 34

It 0 316 35
has 0 316 35
released 0 316 35
something 0 316 35
like 0 316 35
800,000 0 316 35
documents 0 316 35
from 0 316 35
Russia, 0 316 35
and 0 316 35
now 0 316 35
WikiLeaks 0 316 35
is 0 316 35
accused 0 316 35
of 0 316 35
being 0 316 35
an 0 316 35
agent 0 316 35
of 0 316 35
Russia! 0 316 35

WikiLeaks’ 0 316 36
journalism 0 316 36
has 0 316 36
covered 0 316 36
a 0 316 36
universal 0 316 36
space 0 316 36
and 0 316 36
that 0 316 36
is 0 316 36
the 0 316 36
first 0 316 36
time 0 316 36
this 0 316 36
has 0 316 36
happened. 0 316 36

In 0 316 37
Tunisia, 0 316 37
the 0 316 37
release 0 316 37
of 0 316 37
WikiLeaks 0 316 37

the 0 316 38
uprising 0 316 38
in 0 316 38
Tunisia 0 316 38
credit 0 316 38
WikiLeaks 0 316 38
for 0 316 38
informing 0 316 38
them 0 316 38
of 0 316 38
what 0 316 38
their 0 316 38
repressive 0 316 38
government 0 316 38
was 0 316 38
doing 0 316 38
behind 0 316 38
their 0 316 38
backs. 0 316 38

In 0 316 39
Venezuela, 0 316 39
WikiLeaks 0 316 39
released 0 316 39
cables 0 316 39
which 0 316 39
described 0 316 39
in 0 316 39
great 0 316 39
detail 0 316 39
how 0 316 39
the 0 316 39
United 0 316 39
States 0 316 39
intended 0 316 39
to 0 316 39
subvert 0 316 39
the 0 316 39
government 0 316 39
of 0 316 39
Hugo 0 316 39
Chavez. 0 316 39

Some 0 316 40
of 0 316 40
this 0 316 40
was 0 316 40
published 0 316 40
in 0 316 40
the 0 316 40
mainstream 0 316 40
media, 0 316 40
when 0 316 40
there 0 316 40
was 0 316 40
still 0 316 40
a 0 316 40
collaboration 0 316 40
with 0 316 40
WikiLeaks. 0 316 40

The 0 316 41
Clinton/Podesta 0 316 41
emails, 0 316 41
which 0 316 41
appear 0 316 41
to 0 316 41
have 0 316 41
made 0 316 41
a 0 316 41
number 0 316 41
of 0 316 41
people 0 316 41
resentful, 0 316 41
were 0 316 41
published 0 316 41
in 0 316 41
the 0 316 41
New 0 316 41
York 0 316 41
Times. 0 316 41

These 0 316 42
emails 0 316 42
showed 0 316 42
the 0 316 42
close 0 316 42
role 0 316 42
that 0 316 42
Hillary 0 316 42
Clinton 0 316 42
and 0 316 42
the 0 316 42
Clinton 0 316 42
Foundation 0 316 42
played 0 316 42
in 0 316 42
support 0 316 42
of 0 316 42
extreme 1 316 42
jihadism 1 316 42
in 0 316 42
the 0 316 42
Middle 0 316 42
East. 0 316 42

That 0 316 43
was 0 316 43
a 0 316 43
very 0 316 43
important 0 316 43
piece 0 316 43
of 0 316 43

for 0 316 43
people 0 316 43
to 0 316 43
know 0 316 43
and 0 316 43
understand. 0 316 43

By 0 316 44
doing 0 316 44
that, 0 316 44
WikiLeaks 0 316 44
performed 0 316 44
an 1 316 44
extraordinary 1 316 44
public 1 316 44
service, 1 316 44
while 0 316 44
at 0 316 44
the 0 316 44

JP: 0 316 48
Julian 0 316 48
is 0 316 48
a 1 316 48
very 1 316 48
principled 1 316 48
individual. 1 316 48

He 0 316 49
feels 0 316 49
very 0 316 49
strongly 0 316 49
about 0 316 49
the 0 316 49
moral 0 316 49
basis 0 316 49
of 0 316 49
WikiLeaks. 0 316 49

When 0 316 50
he 0 316 50
first 0 316 50
put 0 316 50
up 0 316 50
WikiLeaks, 0 316 50
he 0 316 50
wrote 0 316 50
that 0 316 50
the 0 316 50
whole 0 316 50
idea 0 316 50
of 0 316 50
transparency, 0 316 50
honoring 0 316 50
people’s 0 316 50
right 0 316 50
to 0 316 50
know, 0 316 50
was 0 316 50
the 0 316 50
central 0 316 50
aim 0 316 50
of 0 316 50
the 0 316 50
website. 0 316 50

He 0 316 51
feels 0 316 51
that 0 316 51
very 0 316 51
strongly. 0 316 51

Any 0 316 52
attempt 0 316 52
to 0 316 52
do 0 316 52
a 0 316 52
deal 0 316 52

Julian 0 316 52
to 0 316 52
shut 0 316 52
down 0 316 52
WikiLeaks 0 316 52
will 0 316 52
no 0 316 52
doubt 0 316 52
be 0 316 52

As 0 316 53
a 0 316 53
person, 0 316 53
Julian 0 316 53
is 0 316 53
an 1 316 53
extremely 1 316 53
interesting 1 316 53
man. 1 316 53

He 0 316 54
is 0 316 54
very 0 316 54
well 0 316 54
read. 0 316 54

He 0 316 55
studied 0 316 55
physics. 0 316 55

He 0 316 56
has 0 316 56
a 0 316 56
very 0 316 56
good 0 316 56
sense 0 316 56
of 0 316 56
humor, 0 316 56
and 0 316 56
I 0 316 56
have 0 316 56
often 0 316 56
laughed 0 316 56
out 0 316 56
loud 0 316 56
with 0 316 56
him 0 316 56
about 0 316 56
situations 0 316 56
that 0 316 56
others 0 316 56
might 0 316 56
consider 0 316 56
too 0 316 56
bleak 0 316 56
to 0 316 56
discuss. 0 316 56

His 0 316 57
black 0 316 57
humor 0 316 57
is 0 316 57
a 0 316 57
part 0 316 57
of 0 316 57
his 0 316 57
survival 0 316 57
kit. 0 316 57

Obviously, 0 316 58
he 0 316 58
is 0 316 58
incredibly 0 316 58
resilient. 0 316 58

Personally, 0 316 59
I 0 316 59
could 0 316 59
never 0 316 59
endure 0 316 59
what 0 316 59
he 0 316 59
has, 0 316 59
especially 0 316 59
in 0 316 59
recent 0 316 59
years. 0 316 59

But 0 316 60
this 0 316 60
comes 0 316 60
with 0 316 60
a 0 316 60
cost 0 316 60
and 0 316 60
his 0 316 60
health 0 316 60
is 0 316 60
continuing 0 316 60
to 0 316 60
deteriorate. 0 316 60

Those 0 316 61
close 0 316 61
to 0 316 61
him 0 316 61
are 0 316 61
extremely 1 316 61
worried. 1 316 61

entirely 0 316 72
the 0 316 72
case 0 316 72
in 0 316 72

the 0 316 73

empire 0 316 73

the 0 316 73

In 0 316 74
many 0 316 74

of 0 316 74
the 0 316 74
world, 0 316 74
Britain 0 316 74

still 0 316 74
the 0 316 74
biggest 0 316 74
corporate 0 316 74
investor. 0 316 74

But 0 316 75
it 1 316 75
does 1 316 75
move 1 316 75
in 1 316 75
lockstep 1 316 75
with 1 316 75
the 1 316 75
US 1 316 75

It 0 316 76
is 0 316 76
interesting 0 316 76

the 0 316 76
corruption 0 316 76
that 0 316 76
this 0 316 76
kind 0 316 76
of 0 316 76
relationship 0 316 76
produces. 0 316 76

Information 0 316 77
has 0 316 77
come 0 316 77
out 0 316 77
that 0 316 77
the 0 316 77
Crown 0 316 77
Prosecution 0 316 77
Service 0 316 77
tried 0 316 77
to 0 316 77
prevent 0 316 77
the 0 316 77
Swedes 0 316 77
from 0 316 77

up 0 316 77
the 0 316 77
case 0 316 77
against 0 316 77
Julian 0 316 77
on 0 316 77
bogus 1 316 77
sexual 1 316 77
assault 1 316 77
charges. 1 316 77

The 0 316 78
pressure 0 316 78
was 0 316 78
on 0 316 78
from 0 316 78
London 0 316 78
to 0 316 78
keep 0 316 78
it 0 316 78
going. 0 316 78

Julian 0 316 79
is 0 316 79
also 0 316 79
seen 0 316 79
as 0 316 79
defying 0 316 79
a 0 316 79
system 0 316 79
and 0 316 79
that 0 316 79
is 0 316 79
just 0 316 79
not 0 316 79
acceptable. 0 316 79

There 0 316 80
is 0 316 80
a 0 316 80
real 0 316 80
element 0 316 80
of 0 316 80
vindictiveness 0 316 80
here. 0 316 80

The 0 316 81
Crown 0 316 81
Prosecution 0 316 81
Service 0 316 81
kept 0 316 81
this 0 316 81
case 0 316 81
going 0 316 81
when 0 316 81
otherwise 0 316 81
the 0 316 81
European 0 316 81
warrant 0 316 81
put 0 316 81
out 0 316 81
by 0 316 81
the 0 316 81
Swedes 0 316 81
would 0 316 81
have 0 316 81
been 0 316 81
abandoned 0 316 81
in 0 316 81
2013. 0 316 81

When 0 316 82
Julian 0 316 82
came 0 316 82
up 0 316 82
to 0 316 82
a 0 316 82
bail 0 316 82
hearing 0 316 82
last 0 316 82
year, 0 316 82
it 1 316 82
was 1 316 82
an 1 316 82
absolute 1 316 82
disgrace. 1 316 82

The 0 316 83
judge 0 316 83
described 0 316 83
Julian’s 0 316 83
circumstances 0 316 83
as 0 316 83
if 0 316 83
he 0 316 83
were 0 316 83
on 0 316 83
some 0 316 83
sort 0 316 83
of 0 316 83
extended 0 316 83
vacation. 0 316 83

What 1 316 84
didn’t 1 316 84
emerge 1 316 84
was 1 316 84
the 1 316 84
whole 1 316 84
conflict 1 316 84
of 1 316 84
interest 1 316 84
in 1 316 84
this 1 316 84
hearing. 1 316 84

The 1 316 85
judge’s 1 316 85
husband 1 316 85
is 1 316 85
a 1 316 85
figure 1 316 85
deep 1 316 85
within 1 316 85
the 1 316 85
national 1 316 85
security 1 316 85
establishment 1 316 85
in 1 316 85
Britain 1 316 85
who 1 316 85
was 1 316 85
named 1 316 85
in 1 316 85
WikiLeaks 1 316 85

Because 1 316 86
there 1 316 86
is 1 316 86
no 1 316 86
serious 1 316 86
media 1 316 86

the 1 316 86

hunt, 1 316 86
virtually 1 316 86
none 1 316 86
of 1 316 86
this 1 316 86
emerges. 1 316 86

been 0 316 90
no 0 316 90

You 1 316 91
are 1 316 91
absolutely 1 316 91
right 1 316 91
in 0 316 91
that 0 316 91
the 0 316 91

what 0 316 91

happen 0 316 91

I 0 316 92
was 0 316 92
looking 0 316 92
this 0 316 92
morning 0 316 92
at 0 316 92
a 0 316 92
report 0 316 92
by 0 316 92
Media 0 316 92
Lens 0 316 92
in 0 316 92
Britain 0 316 92
describing 0 316 92
how 0 316 92
the 0 316 92
British 0 316 92
press 0 316 92
has 0 316 92
reported 0 316 92
on 0 316 92
Julian 0 316 92
Assange. 0 316 92

It 0 316 93
describes 0 316 93
the 1 316 93
tsunami 1 316 93
of 1 316 93
vindictive 1 316 93
personal 1 316 93
abuse 1 316 93
that 0 316 93
has 0 316 93
been 0 316 93
heaped 1 316 93
upon 1 316 93
Julian 0 316 93
from 0 316 93
well-known 0 316 93
journalists, 0 316 93
many 0 316 93
claiming 0 316 93
liberal 0 316 93
credentials. 0 316 93

The 0 316 94
Guardian, 0 316 94
which 1 316 94
used 1 316 94
to 1 316 94
consider 1 316 94
itself 1 316 94
the 1 316 94
most 1 316 94
enlightened 1 316 94
newspaper 1 316 94
in 1 316 94
the 1 316 94
country, 1 316 94
has 0 316 94
probably 0 316 94
been 0 316 94
the 0 316 94
worst. 0 316 94

The 0 316 95
frontal 0 316 95
attacks 0 316 95
have 0 316 95
been 0 316 95
coming 0 316 95
not 0 316 95
from 0 316 95
governments 0 316 95
but 0 316 95
from 0 316 95
journalists. 0 316 95

I 0 316 96
described 0 316 96
this 0 316 96
recently 0 316 96
as 0 316 96
“Vichy 1 316 96

a 0 316 96
term 0 316 96
which 0 316 96
now 0 316 96
fits 0 316 96
so 0 316 96
much 0 316 96
of 0 316 96
the 0 316 96
mainstream 0 316 96

It 1 316 97
collaborates 1 316 97
in 1 316 97
the 1 316 97
same 1 316 97
way 1 316 97
that 1 316 97
the 1 316 97
Vichy 1 316 97
government 1 316 97
in 1 316 97

worked 0 316 101

precisely 1 316 102
because 1 316 102
WikiLeaks 1 316 102

It’s 0 316 110
very 0 316 110
simple. 0 316 110

This 0 316 111
is 0 316 111
about 0 316 111
justice. 0 316 111

In 0 316 112
a 0 316 112
famous 0 316 112
speech 0 316 112
given 0 316 112
in 0 316 112
the 0 316 112
1930’s 0 316 112

Parson 0 316 112
Martin 0 316 112
Niemoller, 0 316 112
he 0 316 112
said 0 316 112
that 0 316 112
first 0 316 112
the 0 316 112
Nazis 0 316 112
came 0 316 112
for 0 316 112
socialists, 0 316 112
but 0 316 112
he 0 316 112
didn’t 0 316 112
speak 0 316 112
up 0 316 112
because 0 316 112
that 0 316 112
didn’t 0 316 112
concern 0 316 112
him. 0 316 112

Then 0 316 113
they 0 316 113
came 0 316 113
for 0 316 113
trade 0 316 113
unionists, 0 316 113
but 0 316 113
he 0 316 113
didn’t 0 316 113
speak 0 316 113
up 0 316 113
because 0 316 113
that 0 316 113
didn’t 0 316 113

He 0 316 114
didn’t 0 316 114

up 0 316 114
when 0 316 114
they 0 316 114
came 0 316 114
for 0 316 114
the 0 316 114
Jews 0 316 114
because 0 316 114
he 0 316 114
wasn’t 0 316 114
a 0 316 114
Jew. 0 316 114

of 0 316 115

finally 0 316 115
they 0 316 115

a 0 316 116
precise 0 316 116

kept 0 316 117

Trump 0 325 5
contends 0 325 5
he 0 325 5
signed 0 325 5
off 0 325 5

attorney 0 325 5
general 0 325 5

however, 0 325 5
told 0 325 5
CNN 0 325 5
Monday 0 325 5
morning 0 325 5
that 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
sitting 0 325 5

required 0 325 5
to 0 325 5
fully 0 325 5
cooperate 0 325 5
with 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
federal 0 325 5
investigation 0 325 5
because 0 325 5
he 0 325 5
is 0 325 5
a 0 325 5
government 0 325 5
lawyer, 0 325 5
not 0 325 5
a 0 325 5

attorney. 0 325 5

But 0 325 6
Trump 0 325 6
on 0 325 6
Monday 0 325 6
morning 0 325 6
tweeted 0 325 6
that 0 325 6
McGahn 0 325 6
spoke 0 325 6
with 0 325 6
the 0 325 6
special 0 325 6
counsel 0 325 6
team 0 325 6
for 0 325 6
“over 0 325 6

of 0 325 6
transparency.” 0 325 6
(The 1 325 6
tweet 1 325 6
included 1 325 6
a 1 325 6
misspelling 1 325 6
of 1 325 6
“counsel.”) 1 325 6

The 0 325 7
length 0 325 7
of 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
Mueller-McGahn 0 325 7
sessions 0 325 7
led 0 325 7
Trump 0 325 7
to 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
conclusion 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
special 0 325 7
counsel 0 325 7
is 0 325 7
“looking 1 325 7
for 1 325 7
trouble” 1 325 7
because 0 325 7
they 0 325 7
“they 1 325 7

there 1 325 7
is 1 325 7
no 1 325 7

Collusion.” 1 325 7

But 0 325 8
Mueller 0 325 8
reportedly 0 325 8
is 0 325 8
keenly 0 325 8
interested 0 325 8
in 0 325 8
a 0 325 8

June 0 325 8

arranged 0 325 8
by 0 325 8
Donald 0 325 8
Trump 0 325 8
Jr., 0 325 8
which 0 325 8
included 0 325 8
a 0 325 8
Russian 0 325 8
attorney 0 325 8
who 0 325 8
promised 0 325 8

The 0 325 9
session 0 325 9
also 0 325 9
was 0 325 9
attended 0 325 9
by 0 325 9
then-campaign 0 325 9
chairman 0 325 9
Paul 0 325 9

and 0 325 9
Trump 0 325 9
son-in-law 0 325 9
Jared 0 325 9
Kushner; 0 325 9
the 1 325 9
president 1 325 9
dictated 1 325 9
a 1 325 9
misleading 1 325 9
statement 1 325 9
about 1 325 9
it 1 325 9
a 1 325 9
year 1 325 9
later 1 325 9
and 1 325 9
it 1 325 9
remains 1 325 9
murky 1 325 9
just 1 325 9
when 1 325 9
he 1 325 9
learned 1 325 9
about 1 325 9
the 1 325 9
meeting. 1 325 9

As 0 325 10
Roll 0 325 10
Call 0 325 10
has 0 325 10
reported, 0 325 10
Trump 0 325 10
was 0 325 10
in 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
tower 0 325 10
at 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
time 0 325 10
of 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
session 0 325 10
with 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
Russian 0 325 10
lawyer. 0 325 10

The 0 325 11
president 0 325 11
also 0 325 11
continued 0 325 11
to 0 325 11
push 0 325 11
a 0 325 11
line 0 325 11
first 1 325 11
floated 1 325 11
by 0 325 11
his 0 325 11
attorney, 0 325 11
former 0 325 11
New 0 325 11
York 0 325 11
mayor 0 325 11
and 0 325 11
U.S. 0 325 11
attorney 0 325 11
Rudolph 0 325 11
Giuliani, 0 325 11
tweeting 0 325 11
that 0 325 11
campaign 0 325 11
collusion 0 325 11
with 0 325 11
Russia 0 325 11
would 0 325 11
be 0 325 11
a 1 325 11
“phony 1 325 11
crime.” 1 325 11
He’s 0 325 11
right, 0 325 11
there 0 325 11
is 0 325 11
no 0 325 11
specific 0 325 11
collusion 0 325 11
statute. 0 325 11

But 1 325 12
legal 1 325 12
experts 1 325 12
say 1 325 12
anyone 1 325 12
in 1 325 12
Trump’s 1 325 12
orbit 1 325 12
would 1 325 12
be 1 325 12
charged 1 325 12
with 1 325 12
conspiracy, 1 325 12
making 1 325 12
false 1 325 12
statements 1 325 12
to 1 325 12
federal 1 325 12
investigators 1 325 12
or 1 325 12
obstructing 1 325 12
justice. 1 325 12

All 1 325 13
are 1 325 13
federal 1 325 13
crimes. 1 325 13

Trump 1 325 14
also 1 325 14
continued 1 325 14
to 1 325 14
cast 1 325 14
himself 1 325 14
as 1 325 14
a 1 325 14
victim 1 325 14
in 1 325 14
the 1 325 14
matter, 1 325 14
saying 1 325 14
when 1 325 14
he 1 325 14
attempts 1 325 14
to 1 325 14
“FIGHT 1 325 14
BACK 1 325 14
or 1 325 14
say 1 325 14
anything 1 325 14
bad 1 325 14
about 1 325 14
the 1 325 14

Hunt,” 1 325 14
his 1 325 14
critics 1 325 14
“scream 1 325 14
Obstruction!” 1 325 14

Mueller 0 325 15
also 0 325 15
is 0 325 15
looking 0 325 15
at 0 325 15
whether 0 325 15

Trump: 0 326 2
You’re 1 326 2
wrong, 1 326 2
Mr. 1 326 2
President. 1 326 2

Sessions 0 326 3
long 0 326 3
has 0 326 3
been 0 326 3
one 1 326 3
of 1 326 3
Trump’s 1 326 3
favorite 1 326 3
pinatas, 1 326 3
often 0 326 3
taking 0 326 3
the 0 326 3
brunt 0 326 3
of 0 326 3
the 1 326 3
president’s 1 326 3
public 1 326 3
scorn. 1 326 3

Trump 0 326 4
offered 0 326 4
this 0 326 4
assessment 0 326 4
of 0 326 4
his 0 326 4
hand-picked 0 326 4
attorney 0 326 4
general 0 326 4

“What 1 326 4
kind 1 326 4
of 1 326 4
man 1 326 4
is 1 326 4
this?” 1 326 4

Trump, 0 326 5
in 0 326 5
an 0 326 5
interview 0 326 5
that 0 326 5
aired 0 326 5
Thursday 0 326 5
morning, 0 326 5
also 0 326 5
blasted 1 326 5
Sessions 0 326 5
because, 0 326 5
he 0 326 5
said, 0 326 5
the 1 326 5
former 1 326 5
Alabama 1 326 5
senator 1 326 5
“never 1 326 5

Justice 1 326 5
Department.” 1 326 5

About 0 326 6
seven 0 326 6
hours 0 326 6
later, 0 326 6
the 0 326 6
country’s 0 326 6
top 0 326 6

so, 0 326 7
took 0 326 7

a 0 326 7

during 0 326 7
his 0 326 7

19-month-old 0 326 7
presidency. 0 326 7

“I 0 326 8

the 0 326 8
AG 0 326 8

in 0 326 8
a 0 326 8

I 0 326 10

“However, 1 326 11

comes 0 326 12
amid 0 326 12
nearly 1 326 12

What's 0 338 50
amazing 0 338 50
is 0 338 50
that 0 338 50
Democrats 0 338 50
cover 0 338 50
for 0 338 50
their 0 338 50
own, 0 338 50
ignoring 0 338 50
the 0 338 50
obvious 1 338 50
hypocrisy 1 338 50
they 0 338 50
demonstrate 0 338 50
when 0 338 50
they 0 338 50
opponents 0 338 50
are 0 338 50
accused 0 338 50
of 0 338 50
such 0 338 50
things. 0 338 50

Even 0 338 51
one 0 338 51
woman 0 338 51
in 0 338 51
the 0 338 51
Loomer 0 338 51
video 0 338 51
says, 0 338 51
why 0 338 51
are 0 338 51
they 0 338 51
waiting 0 338 51
till 0 338 51
now 0 338 51
to 0 338 51
bring 0 338 51
this 0 338 51
forward? 0 338 51

Well, 0 338 52
for 0 338 52
Ms. 0 338 52
Monahan, 0 338 52
perhaps 0 338 52
that 0 338 52
could 0 338 52
be 0 338 52
asked, 0 338 52
but 0 338 52
not 0 338 52
for 0 338 52
Amy 0 338 52
Alexander. 0 338 52

That 0 338 53
report 0 338 53
was 0 338 53
filed 0 338 53
more 0 338 53
than 0 338 53
a 0 338 53
decade 0 338 53

It 0 338 54
appears 0 338 54
that 0 338 54
with 0 338 54
Ms. 0 338 54

public 0 338 54
with 0 338 54
his 0 338 54
side 0 338 54
of 0 338 54
the 0 338 54
story 0 338 54
that 0 338 54
perhaps, 0 338 54
he 0 338 54

not 0 338 54
changed 0 338 54
his 0 338 54
ways 0 338 54
at 0 338 54
all. 0 338 54

In 0 338 55
fact, 0 338 55
he 0 338 55
can 0 338 55
more 0 338 55
than 0 338 55
likely 0 338 55
justify 0 338 55
his 0 338 55
actions 0 338 55
based 0 338 55

The 0 80 20

not 0 80 20
injured 0 80 20

placed 0 80 20

the 0 80 20

of 0 80 20
the 0 80 20

This 0 80 22
investigation 0 80 22
is 0 80 22
ongoing 0 80 22
and 0 80 22
we 0 80 22

it 0 80 22
is 0 80 22
appropriate 0 80 22
to 0 80 22
do 0 80 22
so. 0 80 22

I 0 80 23
have 0 80 23
no 0 80 23
idea 0 80 23
how 0 80 23
you 0 80 23
can 0 80 23
enter 0 80 23
an 0 80 23
apartment 0 80 23
mistakenly. 0 80 23

Does 0 80 24
Guyger 0 80 24

Furthermore, 0 80 25
The 0 80 25

reports: 0 80 25

Jean, 0 80 26
who 0 80 26
lived 0 80 26
on 0 80 26
the 0 80 26
fourth 0 80 26
floor 0 80 26
of 0 80 26
the 0 80 26
South 0 80 26
Side 0 80 26
Flats 0 80 26
in 0 80 26
the 0 80 26
Cedars, 0 80 26
was 0 80 26
home 0 80 26
alone 0 80 26
when 0 80 26
Guyger 0 80 26
mistook 0 80 26
his 0 80 26
apartment 0 80 26
for 0 80 26
hers, 0 80 26
the 1 80 26
affidavit 1 80 26
says. 1 80 26

Guyger 0 80 27
lived 0 80 27
on 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
third 0 80 27
floor, 0 80 27
directly 0 80 27
beneath 0 80 27
his 0 80 27
apartment, 0 80 27
and 0 80 27
mistakenly 0 80 27
parked 0 80 27
on 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
fourth 0 80 27
floor 0 80 27
after 0 80 27
finishing 0 80 27
a 0 80 27
shift 0 80 27
at 0 80 27
the 0 80 27
Dallas 0 80 27
Police 0 80 27
Department, 0 80 27
the 1 80 27
affidavit 1 80 27
says. 1 80 27

When 0 80 28
she 0 80 28
arrived 0 80 28
at 0 80 28
Jean's 0 80 28
door, 0 80 28
Guyger 0 80 28
entered 0 80 28
a 0 80 28
unique 0 80 28
door 0 80 28
key 0 80 28
with 0 80 28
an 0 80 28
electronic 0 80 28
chip 0 80 28
into 0 80 28
the 0 80 28
keyhole, 0 80 28
the 1 80 28
affidavit 1 80 28
says. 1 80 28

The 0 80 29
door 0 80 29
was 0 80 29
already 0 80 29
ajar, 0 80 29
so 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
force 0 80 29
of 0 80 29
pushing 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
key 0 80 29
inside 0 80 29
opened 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
door, 0 80 29
according 0 80 29
to 0 80 29
the 0 80 29
affidavit. 0 80 29

The 1 80 30
affidavit 1 80 30
says 1 80 30
the 0 80 30
apartments' 0 80 30
"respective 0 80 30
interior 0 80 30
floorplans 0 80 30
are 0 80 30
in 0 80 30
most 0 80 30
ways 0 80 30
identical 0 80 30
or 0 80 30
extremely 0 80 30
similar." 0 80 30

The 0 80 31
apartment 0 80 31
was 0 80 31
dark 0 80 31
and 0 80 31
when 0 80 31
she 0 80 31
saw 0 80 31
"a 0 80 31
large 0 80 31
silhouette," 0 80 31
Guyger 0 80 31
thought 0 80 31
she 0 80 31
was 0 80 31
being 0 80 31
burglarized, 0 80 31
the 1 80 31
affidavit 1 80 31
says. 1 80 31

The 1 80 32
affidavit 1 80 32
says 1 80 32
Guyger 0 80 32
drew 0 80 32
her 0 80 32
gun, 0 80 32
"gave 0 80 32
verbal 0 80 32
commands 0 80 32
that 0 80 32
were 0 80 32
ignored" 0 80 32
and 0 80 32
fired 0 80 32
twice. 0 80 32

Jean 0 80 33
was 0 80 33
struck 0 80 33
once 0 80 33
in 0 80 33
the 0 80 33
torso. 0 80 33

Guyger 0 80 34
then 0 80 34
called 0 80 34
911 0 80 34
from 0 80 34
her 0 80 34
cellphone 0 80 34
and 0 80 34
started 0 80 34
performing 0 80 34
first 0 80 34
aid. 0 80 34

She 0 80 35
turned 0 80 35
on 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
lights, 0 80 35
then 0 80 35
went 0 80 35
to 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
front 0 80 35
door 0 80 35
again 0 80 35
and 0 80 35
realized 0 80 35
the 0 80 35
apartment 0 80 35
wasn't 0 80 35
hers, 0 80 35
the 1 80 35
affidavit 1 80 35
says. 1 80 35

She 0 80 36
told 0 80 36
the 0 80 36
911 0 80 36
operator 0 80 36
as 0 80 36
well 0 80 36
as 0 80 36
responding 0 80 36
officers 0 80 36
that 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
thought 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
was 0 80 36
at 0 80 36
her 0 80 36
apartment 0 80 36
when 0 80 36
she 0 80 36
shot 0 80 36
Jean, 0 80 36
according 1 80 36
to 1 80 36
the 1 80 36
affidavit. 1 80 36

Ok, 0 80 37
some 0 80 37
of 0 80 37
this 0 80 37
seems 0 80 37
plausible, 0 80 37
but 0 80 37
I 0 80 37
still 0 80 37
am 0 80 37
left 0 80 37
wondering 0 80 37
about 0 80 37
the 0 80 37
door 0 80 37
being 0 80 37
ajar. 0 80 37

Is 0 80 38
this 0 80 38
something 0 80 38
people 0 80 38
are 0 80 38
prone 0 80 38
to 0 80 38
do 0 80 38
at 0 80 38
1o 0 80 38
o'clock 0 80 38
at 0 80 38
night 0 80 38
in 0 80 38
Dallas? 0 80 38

In 0 80 39
any 0 80 39
case, 0 80 39
we 0 80 39
all 0 80 39
know 0 80 39
that 0 80 39
any 0 80 39
of 0 80 39
us 0 80 39
who 0 80 39
did 0 80 39
the 0 80 39
same 0 80 39
thing 0 80 39
would 0 80 39
have 0 80 39
immediately 0 80 39
been 0 80 39
taken 0 80 39
into 0 80 39
custody. 0 80 39

This 0 80 40
was 0 80 40
not 0 80 40
the 0 80 40
case 0 80 40
with 0 80 40
Guyger, 0 80 40
though 0 80 40
one 0 80 40
officer 0 80 40
close 0 80 40
to 0 80 40
her 0 80 40
said, 0 80 40
"she 0 80 40
is 0 80 40
devastated." 0 80 40

Knowing 0 80 41
this 0 80 41
provoked 0 80 41
outrage 0 80 41
across 0 80 41
the 0 80 41
nation 0 80 41
over 0 80 41
the 0 80 41
weekend. 0 80 41

In 0 80 42
fact, 0 80 42
this 0 80 42
is 0 80 42
not 0 80 42
her 0 80 42
first 0 80 42
shooting. 0 80 42

As 0 80 43
a 0 80 43
four-year 0 80 43
veteran 0 80 43
of 0 80 43
the 0 80 43
force, 0 80 43
she 0 80 43
was 0 80 43
also 0 80 43
involved 0 80 43
in 0 80 43
the 0 80 43
shooting 0 80 43
of 0 80 43

In 0 80 45
2017, 0 80 45
Guyger 0 80 45

47-year-old 0 80 45
Uvaldo 0 80 45
Perez, 0 80 45
who 0 80 45
had 0 80 45
wrestled 0 80 45
a 0 80 45
Taser 0 80 45
away 0 80 45
from 0 80 45
her. 0 80 45

Another 0 80 46
officer 0 80 46
had 0 80 46
been 0 80 46
in 0 80 46
a 0 80 46
Pleasant 0 80 46
Grove 0 80 46
neighborhood 0 80 46
looking 0 80 46
for 0 80 46
a 0 80 46

who 0 80 46
had 0 80 46

warrant 0 80 46
out 0 80 46
for 0 80 46
her 0 80 46
arrest. 0 80 46

When 0 80 47
the 0 80 47
officer 0 80 47
thought 0 80 47
he 0 80 47
saw 0 80 47
the 0 80 47
woman 0 80 47
in 0 80 47
a 0 80 47
car 0 80 47

of 0 80 47
Reva 0 80 47

the 0 80 47
officer 0 80 47
asked 0 80 47
for 0 80 47
backup 0 80 47
from 0 80 47
Guyger 0 80 47
and 0 80 47
another 0 80 47
officer, 0 80 47
according 0 80 47
to 0 80 47
an 0 80 47
affidavit. 0 80 47

One 0 80 48
of 0 80 48
the 0 80 48
officers 0 80 48
was 0 80 48
trying 0 80 48
to 0 80 48
search 0 80 48
Perez 0 80 48
when 0 80 48
he 0 80 48
became 0 80 48
combative, 0 80 48
the 1 80 48
affidavit 1 80 48
said. 1 80 48

Guyger 0 80 49
deployed 0 80 49
her 0 80 49
Taser 0 80 49
before 0 80 49
Perez 0 80 49
was 0 80 49
able 0 80 49
to 0 80 49
take 0 80 49
it 0 80 49
from 0 80 49
her. 0 80 49

After 0 80 50
Perez 0 80 50
had 0 80 50
the 0 80 50
Taser, 0 80 50
Guyger 0 80 50
fired 0 80 50
her 0 80 50

once, 0 80 50
striking 0 80 50
him 0 80 50

out 0 344 25

strategy.” 1 344 26

And 1 344 27
he 1 344 27
said 1 344 27
it 1 344 27
needs 1 344 27
to 1 344 27
affirm 1 344 27

yesterday, 0 346 12
on 0 346 12
Sept. 0 346 12
13, 0 346 12
Facebook 0 346 12
notified 0 346 12
Jamie 0 346 12
that 0 346 12
it 0 346 12
had 0 346 12
made 0 346 12
a 0 346 12
mistake 0 346 12
and 0 346 12
that 0 346 12
it 0 346 12
was 0 346 12
lifting 0 346 12

It 1 346 13
goes 1 346 13
without 1 346 13
saying 1 346 13
that 1 346 13
this 1 346 13
retraction 1 346 13
and 1 346 13
surrender 1 346 13
by 1 346 13
Facebook 1 346 13
occurred 1 346 13
only 1 346 13
because 1 346 13
of 1 346 13
the 1 346 13
wide 1 346 13

And 0 346 14
we 1 346 14
are 1 346 14
immensely 1 346 14
grateful 1 346 14

The 0 346 17
Counter 0 346 17
Jihad 0 346 17
Coalition's 0 346 17
(CJC) 0 346 17
Facebook 0 346 17
page, 0 346 17
which 0 346 17
Jamie 0 346 17
helped 0 346 17

with 0 346 17

President 0 346 17
Steve 0 346 17
Amundson, 0 346 17
was 0 346 17
removed 0 346 17
a 0 346 17
few 0 346 17
years 0 346 17
ago 0 346 17
with 1 346 17
absolutely 1 346 17
no 1 346 17
explanation. 1 346 17

The 0 346 18
CJC 0 346 18
is 0 346 18
a 0 346 18
human 0 346 18
rights 0 346 18
and 0 346 18
pro-national 0 346 18
security 0 346 18
group 0 346 18
that 0 346 18
is 0 346 18
dedicated 0 346 18
to 0 346 18
protecting 0 346 18
America 0 346 18
and 0 346 18
the 0 346 18
West 0 346 18
from 0 346 18

and 0 346 18
Muslim 0 346 18
and 0 346 18
non-Muslim 0 346 18
people 0 346 18
from 0 346 18
Sharia 0 346 18
oppression. 0 346 18

The 0 346 19
question 0 346 19
remains: 0 346 19
why 1 346 19
would 1 346 19
Facebook 1 346 19
remove 1 346 19
such 1 346 19
a 1 346 19
page, 1 346 19
let 1 346 19
alone 1 346 19
in 1 346 19
such 1 346 19
a 1 346 19
fascistic 1 346 19
manner 1 346 19
-- 1 346 19
and 1 346 19
never 1 346 19
explain 1 346 19
why? 1 346 19

In 0 346 20
April 0 346 20
earlier 0 346 20
this 0 346 20
year, 0 346 20
Jamie 0 346 20
was 0 346 20
suspended 0 346 20
from 0 346 20
Facebook 0 346 20
for 0 346 20
posting 0 346 20
screenshots 0 346 20
of 0 346 20
a 0 346 20
Muslim's 0 346 20
threat 0 346 20
to 0 346 20
him 0 346 20
on 0 346 20
the 0 346 20
platform. 0 346 20

Then, 0 346 21
in 0 346 21
May, 0 346 21
his 0 346 21
Twitter 0 346 21
account 0 346 21
was 0 346 21
temporarily 0 346 21
suspended 0 346 21
and 0 346 21
he 0 346 21
was 0 346 21
forced 0 346 21
to 0 346 21
delete 0 346 21
tweets 0 346 21
he 0 346 21
posted 0 346 21
which 0 346 21
directly 0 346 21
quoted 0 346 21
Islamic 0 346 21
religious 0 346 21
texts. 0 346 21

His 0 346 22
account 0 346 22
was 0 346 22
suspended 0 346 22
for 0 346 22
violating 0 346 22
Twitter’s 0 346 22
rules 0 346 22
relating 0 346 22
to 0 346 22
“hateful 1 346 22
conduct.” 1 346 22
It 0 346 22
is 0 346 22
"hateful 1 346 22
conduct", 1 346 22
apparently, 0 346 22
to 0 346 22
reference 0 346 22
what 0 346 22
Islamic 0 346 22
texts 0 346 22
themselves 0 346 22
say. 0 346 22

Indeed, 0 346 23
Frontpage's 0 346 23
editor 0 346 23
had 0 346 23
simply 0 346 23
referred 0 346 23
to 0 346 23
Sahih 0 346 23
Bukhari’s 0 346 23
texts 0 346 23
discussing 0 346 23
Mohammed’s 0 346 23
marriage 0 346 23
to 0 346 23

when 0 346 23
she 0 346 23
was 0 346 23
six 0 346 23
years 0 346 23
old 0 346 23
(7.62.88) 0 346 23
and 0 346 23
to 0 346 23
Qur'anic 0 346 23
Suras 0 346 23
that 0 346 23
mandate 0 346 23
the 0 346 23
Hijab 0 346 23

and 0 346 23

sexual 0 346 23
slavery 0 346 23
(4:3; 0 346 23
33:50). 0 346 23

One 0 346 24
thing 0 346 24
we 0 346 24
know 0 346 24
for 0 346 24
sure 0 346 24
is 0 346 24
that, 0 346 24
despite 0 346 24
this 0 346 24
lifting 0 346 24

Senator 0 349 8
Dianne 0 349 8
Feinstein 0 349 8
(D-Calif.), 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
ranking 0 349 8
Democrat 0 349 8
on 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
Senate 0 349 8
Judiciary 0 349 8
Committee 0 349 8
that 0 349 8
heard 0 349 8
Judge 0 349 8
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 8
public 0 349 8
testimony 0 349 8
earlier 0 349 8
this 0 349 8
month 0 349 8
during 0 349 8
his 0 349 8
Supreme 0 349 8
Court 0 349 8
confirmation 0 349 8
hearing, 0 349 8
had 0 349 8
received 0 349 8
last 0 349 8
July 0 349 8
a 0 349 8
copy 0 349 8
of 0 349 8
a 0 349 8
letter 0 349 8
written 0 349 8
by 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
woman 0 349 8
making 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
charge, 0 349 8
who 0 349 8
we 0 349 8
now 0 349 8
know 0 349 8
was 0 349 8
Ms. 0 349 8
Ford. 0 349 8

Even 0 349 9
though 0 349 9
Senator 0 349 9
Feinstein 0 349 9
had 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
letter 0 349 9
in 0 349 9
hand, 0 349 9
she 0 349 9
never 0 349 9
brought 0 349 9
up 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
charge 0 349 9
during 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
public 0 349 9
hearing, 0 349 9
nor 0 349 9
during 0 349 9
her 0 349 9
own 0 349 9
meeting 0 349 9
with 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
judge. 0 349 9

Instead, 0 349 10
Senator 0 349 10
Feinstein 0 349 10
sat 0 349 10
on 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
letter 0 349 10
until 0 349 10
late 0 349 10
last 0 349 10
week, 0 349 10
when 0 349 10
she 0 349 10
issued 0 349 10
a 0 349 10
cryptic 0 349 10
release 0 349 10
stating 0 349 10
that 0 349 10
she 0 349 10
had 0 349 10
received 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
letter 0 349 10
but 0 349 10
did 0 349 10
not 0 349 10
want 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
give 0 349 10
more 0 349 10
details 0 349 10
in 0 349 10
deference 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
woman’s 0 349 10
wish 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
keep 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
matter 0 349 10
confidential. 0 349 10

Senator 0 349 11
Feinstein 0 349 11
turned 0 349 11
the 0 349 11
letter 0 349 11
over 0 349 11
to 0 349 11
the 0 349 11
FBI. 0 349 11

The 0 349 12
FBI 0 349 12
placed 0 349 12
the 0 349 12
letter 0 349 12
in 0 349 12
its 0 349 12
background 0 349 12
file 0 349 12
on 0 349 12
Judge 0 349 12
Kavanaugh 0 349 12
but 0 349 12
decided 0 349 12
not 0 349 12
to 0 349 12
pursue 0 349 12
any 0 349 12
further 0 349 12
investigation. 0 349 12

Senator 0 349 13
Feinstein 0 349 13
had 0 349 13
initially 0 349 13
resisted 0 349 13
sharing 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
contents 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
letter 0 349 13
with 0 349 13
her 0 349 13
fellow 0 349 13
Democrat 0 349 13
members 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
Senate 0 349 13
Judiciary 0 349 13
Committee 0 349 13
or 0 349 13
to 0 349 13
go 0 349 13
public 0 349 13
with 0 349 13
its 0 349 13
existence 0 349 13
because 0 349 13
“the 0 349 13
incident 0 349 13
was 0 349 13
too 0 349 13
distant 0 349 13
in 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
past 0 349 13
to 0 349 13
merit 0 349 13
public 0 349 13
discussion” 0 349 13
and 0 349 13
she 0 349 13
had 0 349 13
already 0 349 13
“taken 0 349 13
care 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
it,” 0 349 13
according 0 349 13
to 0 349 13

quoted 0 349 13
by 0 349 13
The 0 349 13

Nevertheless, 0 349 14
Senator 0 349 14
Feinstein 0 349 14
evidently 0 349 14
bowed 0 349 14
to 0 349 14
pressure 0 349 14
from 0 349 14
her 0 349 14

to 0 349 19
the 0 349 19
Washington 0 349 19
Post 0 349 19

that 0 349 19
“one 0 349 19
summer 0 349 19
in 0 349 19
the 0 349 19
early 0 349 19

into 0 349 19
a 0 349 19

Montgomery 0 349 19
County. 0 349 19

While 0 349 20
his 0 349 20
friend 0 349 20
watched, 0 349 20
she 0 349 20
said, 0 349 20
Kavanaugh 0 349 20
pinned 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
to 0 349 20
a 0 349 20
bed 0 349 20
on 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
back 0 349 20
and 0 349 20
groped 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
over 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
clothes, 0 349 20
grinding 0 349 20
his 0 349 20
body 0 349 20
against 0 349 20
hers 0 349 20
and 0 349 20
clumsily 0 349 20
attempting 0 349 20
to 0 349 20
pull 0 349 20
off 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
one-piece 0 349 20

clothing 0 349 20
she 0 349 20
wore 0 349 20
over 0 349 20

When 0 349 21
she 0 349 21
tried 0 349 21
to 0 349 21
scream, 0 349 21
she 0 349 21
said, 0 349 21
he 0 349 21
put 0 349 21
his 0 349 21

remove 0 349 23
my 0 349 23

Ms. 0 349 23
Ford 0 349 23
said 0 349 23
she 0 349 23
was 0 349 23
able 0 349 23
to 0 349 23
escape 0 349 23
the 0 349 23

without 0 349 23
any 0 349 23
apparent 0 349 23
further 0 349 23
incident 0 349 23
after 0 349 23
“Kavanaugh’s 0 349 23

them, 0 349 23
sending 0 349 23
all 0 349 23
three 0 349 23
tumbling.” 0 349 23

Here 0 349 24
is 0 349 24
where 0 349 24
Ms. 0 349 24
Ford’s 0 349 24
story 0 349 24
becomes 0 349 24
quite 0 349 24
murky 0 349 24
and 0 349 24
begins 0 349 24
to 0 349 24
fall 0 349 24
apart. 0 349 24

Although 0 349 25
Ms. 0 349 25
Ford 0 349 25
believes 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
alleged 0 349 25
incident 0 349 25
occurred 0 349 25
during 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
summer 0 349 25
of 0 349 25
1982, 0 349 25
she 0 349 25
“said 0 349 25
she 0 349 25
does 0 349 25
not 0 349 25
remember 0 349 25
some 0 349 25
key 0 349 25
details 0 349 25
of 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
incident,” 0 349 25
according 0 349 25
to 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
Washington 0 349 25
Post 0 349 25
article. 0 349 25

For 0 349 26
example, 0 349 26
Ms. 0 349 26
Ford 0 349 26
“said 0 349 26
she 0 349 26
does 0 349 26
not 0 349 26
remember 0 349 26
how 0 349 26
the 0 349 26
gathering 0 349 26
came 0 349 26
together 0 349 26
the 0 349 26
night 0 349 26
of 0 349 26
the 0 349 26
incident.” 0 349 26
She 0 349 26
also 0 349 26
does 0 349 26
not 0 349 26
remember 0 349 26
how 0 349 26
she 0 349 26
got 0 349 26
home. 0 349 26

Yet 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
claims 0 349 27
to 0 349 27
be 0 349 27
absolutely 0 349 27
certain 0 349 27
that 0 349 27
Kavanaugh, 0 349 27
whom 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
presumably 0 349 27
knew 0 349 27
only 0 349 27
as 0 349 27
an 0 349 27
acquaintance 0 349 27
and 0 349 27
said 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
had 0 349 27
not 0 349 27
spoken 0 349 27
to 0 349 27
since 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
night 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
incident 0 349 27
allegedly 0 349 27
occurred, 0 349 27
was 0 349 27
involved 0 349 27
in 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
alleged 0 349 27
incident. 0 349 27

Ms. 0 349 28
Ford 0 349 28
admitted 0 349 28
that 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
“told 0 349 28
no 0 349 28
one 0 349 28
at 0 349 28
the 0 349 28
time 0 349 28
what 0 349 28
had 0 349 28
happened 0 349 28
to 0 349 28
her.” 0 349 28
In 0 349 28
fact, 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
said 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
recalled 0 349 28
thinking: 0 349 28
“I’m 0 349 28
not 0 349 28
ever 0 349 28
telling 0 349 28
anyone 0 349 28
this. 0 349 28

This 0 349 29
is 0 349 29
nothing, 0 349 29
it 0 349 29
didn’t 0 349 29
happen, 0 349 29
and 0 349 29
he 0 349 29
didn’t 0 349 29
rape 0 349 29
me.” 0 349 29
Even 0 349 29
if 0 349 29
one 0 349 29
explains 0 349 29
this 0 349 29
behavior 0 349 29
as 0 349 29
the 0 349 29
natural 0 349 29
reaction 0 349 29
of 0 349 29
a 0 349 29
frightened 0 349 29
teenager 0 349 29
to 0 349 29
a 0 349 29
highly 0 349 29
traumatic 0 349 29
incident, 0 349 29
that 0 349 29
does 0 349 29
not 0 349 29
explain 0 349 29

Ms. 1 349 34

her 1 349 34
story 1 349 34
to 1 349 34
be 1 349 34

for 0 349 35

We 0 349 36
are 0 349 36
women 0 349 36
who 0 349 36
have 0 349 36
known 0 349 36

more 0 349 36
than 0 349 36
35 0 349 36
years 0 349 36
and 0 349 36
knew 0 349 36
him 0 349 36
while 0 349 36
he 0 349 36
attended 0 349 36

between 0 349 36
1979 0 349 36

For 1 349 37
the 1 349 37
entire 1 349 37

we 1 349 37
have 1 349 37

Kavanaugh, 1 349 37
he 1 349 37
has 1 349 37
behaved 1 349 37
honorably 1 349 37
and 1 349 37
treated 1 349 37
women 1 349 37
with 1 349 37
respect… 1 349 37
Brett 0 349 37
attended 0 349 37
Georgetown 0 349 37
Prep, 0 349 37
an 0 349 37

high 0 349 37
school 0 349 37
in 0 349 37
Rockville, 0 349 37
Maryland. 0 349 37

He 0 349 38
was 0 349 38
an 0 349 38
outstanding 0 349 38
student 0 349 38
and 0 349 38
athlete 0 349 38
with 0 349 38
a 0 349 38
wide 0 349 38
circle 0 349 38
of 0 349 38
friends. 0 349 38

Almost 0 349 39
all 0 349 39
of 0 349 39
us 0 349 39
attended 0 349 39
all-girls 0 349 39
high 0 349 39
schools 0 349 39
in 0 349 39
the 0 349 39
area. 0 349 39

We 0 349 40
knew 0 349 40
Brett 0 349 40
well 0 349 40
through 0 349 40
social 0 349 40
events, 0 349 40
sports, 0 349 40
church, 0 349 40
and 0 349 40
various 0 349 40
other 0 349 40
activities. 0 349 40

Many 0 349 41
of 0 349 41
us 0 349 41
have 0 349 41
remained 0 349 41
close 0 349 41
friends 0 349 41
with 0 349 41
him 0 349 41
and 0 349 41
his 0 349 41
family 0 349 41
over 0 349 41
the 0 349 41
years. 0 349 41

Through 0 349 42
the 0 349 42
more 0 349 42
than 0 349 42
35 0 349 42
years 0 349 42
we 0 349 42
have 0 349 42
known 0 349 42
him, 0 349 42
Brett 0 349 42
has 0 349 42
stood 0 349 42
out 0 349 42
for 0 349 42
his 0 349 42
friendship, 0 349 42
character, 0 349 42
and 0 349 42
integrity. 0 349 42

In 0 349 43
particular, 0 349 43
he 0 349 43
has 0 349 43
always 0 349 43
treated 0 349 43
women 0 349 43
with 0 349 43
decency 0 349 43
and 0 349 43
respect. 0 349 43

That 0 349 44
was 0 349 44
true 0 349 44
when 0 349 44
he 0 349 44
was 0 349 44
in 0 349 44
high 0 349 44
school, 0 349 44
and 0 349 44
it 0 349 44
has 0 349 44
remained 0 349 44
true 0 349 44
to 0 349 44
this 0 349 44
day. 0 349 44

The 0 349 45
signers 0 349 45
of 0 349 45
this 0 349 45
letter 0 349 45
hold 0 349 45
a 0 349 45
broad 0 349 45
range 0 349 45
of 0 349 45
political 0 349 45
views. 0 349 45

Many 0 349 46
of 0 349 46
us 0 349 46
are 0 349 46
not 0 349 46
lawyers, 0 349 46
but 0 349 46
we 0 349 46
know 0 349 46
Brett 0 349 46
Kavanaugh 0 349 46
as 0 349 46
a 0 349 46
person. 0 349 46

And 0 349 47
he 0 349 47
has 0 349 47
always 0 349 47
been 0 349 47
a 0 349 47
good 0 349 47
person. 0 349 47

Nevertheless, 0 349 48
using 0 349 48
their 1 349 48
standard 1 349 48
contemptible, 1 349 48
obstructionist 1 349 48
tactics, 1 349 48
the 0 349 48
Democrats 0 349 48
opposed 0 349 48
to 0 349 48
Judge 0 349 48
Kavanaugh 0 349 48
happily 0 349 48
seized 0 349 48
on 0 349 48
the 0 349 48
unsubstantiated 0 349 48
allegation 0 349 48
of 0 349 48
teen 0 349 48
sexual 0 349 48
misbehavior 0 349 48
in 0 349 48
high 0 349 48
school 0 349 48
to 0 349 48
assassinate 1 349 48
Judge 1 349 48
Kavanaugh’s 1 349 48
character. 1 349 48

They 0 349 49
have 0 349 49
done 0 349 49
so 0 349 49
in 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
face 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
Judge 0 349 49
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 49
lifetime 0 349 49
record 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
stellar 0 349 49
public 0 349 49
service, 0 349 49
multiple 0 349 49
background 0 349 49
checks 0 349 49
producing 0 349 49
no 0 349 49
evidence 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
sexual 0 349 49
misconduct, 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
letter 0 349 49
written 0 349 49
by 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
65 0 349 49
women, 0 349 49
who 0 349 49
knew 0 349 49
him 0 349 49
when 0 349 49
he 0 349 49
was 0 349 49
in 0 349 49
high 0 349 49
school 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
thereafter 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
who 0 349 49
signed 0 349 49
their 0 349 49
names 0 349 49
to 0 349 49
a 0 349 49
ringing 0 349 49
endorsement 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
his 0 349 49
good 0 349 49
character. 0 349 49

Feminists 0 349 50

were 1 349 50
in 1 349 50
line 1 349 50
with 1 349 50
their 1 349 50
ideology. 1 349 50

Senator 0 349 51
Feinstein 0 349 51
called 0 349 51
Ted 1 349 51

also 0 349 51
based 0 349 51
on 0 349 51
their 0 349 51

Hypocritically 0 349 52
exploiting 0 349 52

including 0 349 53
Senator 0 349 53

considered 0 349 55

so 0 349 55
important, 0 349 55
why 1 349 55

all 1 349 56

as 1 360 3
weak 1 360 3
and 1 360 3
ridiculous 1 360 3
as 1 360 3
they 1 360 3
are, 1 360 3
at 1 360 3
Kavanaugh’s 1 360 3
Senate 1 360 3
confirmation 1 360 3
hearings 1 360 3
because 1 360 3
they 1 360 3
didn’t 1 360 3
want 1 360 3
to 1 360 3
have 1 360 3
a 1 360 3
rational 1 360 3
discussion. 1 360 3

They 0 360 4
wanted 0 360 4
to 0 360 4
hurl 1 360 4
the 1 360 4
wild 1 360 4
claims 1 360 4
like 1 360 4
a 1 360 4
grenade 1 360 4
at 0 360 4
the 0 360 4
last 0 360 4
minute 0 360 4
to 0 360 4
blow 0 360 4
up 0 360 4
the 0 360 4
process. 0 360 4

And 0 360 5
so 0 360 5
far 0 360 5
it 0 360 5
appears 0 360 5
they’re 0 360 5
succeeding. 0 360 5

If 0 360 6
Kavanaugh 0 360 6
isn’t 0 360 6
in 0 360 6
place 0 360 6
a 0 360 6
week 0 360 6
from 0 360 6
Monday, 0 360 6
the 0 360 6
Supreme 0 360 6
Court 0 360 6
will 0 360 6
begin 0 360 6
hearing 0 360 6
cases 0 360 6
in 0 360 6
its 0 360 6
new 0 360 6
term 0 360 6
shorthanded. 0 360 6

The 0 360 7
high 0 360 7
court 0 360 7
normally 0 360 7
has 0 360 7
a 0 360 7
complement 0 360 7
of 0 360 7
nine 0 360 7
justices 0 360 7
but 0 360 7
with 0 360 7
Associate 0 360 7
Justice 0 360 7
Anthony 0 360 7
Kennedy’s 0 360 7
retirement 0 360 7
July 0 360 7
31, 0 360 7
which 0 360 7
cleared 0 360 7
the 0 360 7
way 0 360 7
for 0 360 7
Kavanaugh’s 0 360 7
nomination, 0 360 7
there 0 360 7
have 0 360 7
only 0 360 7
been 0 360 7
eight 0 360 7
justices 0 360 7
in 0 360 7
place. 0 360 7

Roughly 0 360 8
speaking 0 360 8
there 0 360 8
is 0 360 8
a 0 360 8
4-to-4 0 360 8
liberal 0 360 8
to 0 360 8
conservative 0 360 8
ideological 0 360 8
split 0 360 8
on 0 360 8
the 0 360 8
court. 0 360 8

Democrats 0 360 9
would 0 360 9
prefer 0 360 9
to 0 360 9
drag 0 360 9
the 0 360 9
confirmation 0 360 9
process 0 360 9
into 0 360 9
the 0 360 9
next 0 360 9
Congress 0 360 9
where 0 360 9
they 0 360 9
hope 0 360 9
to 0 360 9
take 0 360 9
control 0 360 9
from 0 360 9
Republicans. 0 360 9

Election 0 360 10
Day 0 360 10
is 0 360 10
November 0 360 10
6. 0 360 10

The 0 360 11
GOP 0 360 11
currently 0 360 11
controls 0 360 11
the 0 360 11
Senate, 0 360 11
which 0 360 11
has 0 360 11
the 0 360 11
final 0 360 11
say 0 360 11
on 0 360 11
judicial 0 360 11
nominations, 0 360 11
by 0 360 11
an 0 360 11
uncomfortably 0 360 11
close 0 360 11
margin 0 360 11
of 0 360 11
51 0 360 11
to 0 360 11
49. 0 360 11

Christine 0 360 12
Blasey 0 360 12
Ford’s 0 360 12
lawyers 0 360 12
are 0 360 12
trying 0 360 12
to 0 360 12
game 0 360 12
the 0 360 12
system. 0 360 12

They 0 360 13
know 0 360 13
that 0 360 13
Senate 0 360 13
Judiciary 0 360 13
Committee 0 360 13
rules 0 360 13
require 0 360 13
Chairman 0 360 13
Chuck 0 360 13
Grassley 0 360 13
(R-Iowa) 0 360 13
to 0 360 13
provide 0 360 13
a 0 360 13
full 0 360 13
week’s 0 360 13
notice 0 360 13
for 0 360 13
a 0 360 13
hearing. 0 360 13

So, 0 360 14
if, 0 360 14
for 0 360 14
example, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
committee 0 360 14
followed 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
rules 0 360 14
and 0 360 14
agreed 0 360 14
Friday 0 360 14
(today) 0 360 14
to 0 360 14
a 0 360 14
hearing, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
soonest 0 360 14
it 0 360 14
could 0 360 14
be 0 360 14
held 0 360 14
would 0 360 14
be 0 360 14
next 0 360 14
Friday, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
final 0 360 14
business 0 360 14
day 0 360 14
before 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
Supreme 0 360 14
Court’s 0 360 14
new 0 360 14
term 0 360 14
begins. 0 360 14

Of 0 360 15
course, 0 360 15
lawyers 1 360 15
are 1 360 15
masters 1 360 15
of 1 360 15
delay, 1 360 15
and 0 360 15
social 1 360 15
justice 1 360 15
warrior-lawyers 1 360 15
hoping 1 360 15
to 1 360 15
torpedo 1 360 15
President 1 360 15
Trump’s 1 360 15
agenda 1 360 15
have 0 360 15
an 0 360 15
added 0 360 15
incentive 0 360 15
to 0 360 15
drag 0 360 15
the 0 360 15
confirmation 0 360 15
process 0 360 15
out 0 360 15
as 0 360 15
long 0 360 15
as 0 360 15
possible. 0 360 15

New 0 360 16
demands 0 360 16
and 0 360 16
fake 0 360 16
emergencies 0 360 16
are 0 360 16
bound 0 360 16
to 0 360 16
arise 0 360 16
from 0 360 16
Ford’s 0 360 16
legal 0 360 16
team. 0 360 16

It 0 360 17
was 0 360 17
unclear 0 360 17
at 0 360 17
press 0 360 17
time 0 360 17
if 0 360 17
the 0 360 17
public 0 360 17
hearing 0 360 17
scheduled 0 360 17
for 0 360 17
Monday 0 360 17
into 0 360 17
the 0 360 17
allegations 0 360 17
of 0 360 17
sexual 0 360 17
misconduct 0 360 17
against 0 360 17
Kavanaugh 0 360 17
would 0 360 17
go 0 360 17
forward. 0 360 17

Kavanaugh 0 360 18
informed 0 360 18
the 0 360 18
committee 0 360 18
he 0 360 18
was 0 360 18
willing 0 360 18
to 0 360 18
testify 0 360 18
Monday. 0 360 18

“I 0 360 19
continue 0 360 19
to 0 360 19
want 0 360 19
a 0 360 19
hearing 0 360 19
as 0 360 19
soon 0 360 19
as 0 360 19
possible, 0 360 19
so 0 360 19
that 0 360 19
I 0 360 19
can 0 360 19
clear 0 360 19
my 0 360 19
name," 0 360 19
he 0 360 19
wrote 0 360 19
in 0 360 19
a 0 360 19
letter. 0 360 19

Ford's 0 360 20
lawyer 0 360 20
Debra 0 360 20
Katz 0 360 20
told 0 360 20
the 0 360 20
Judiciary 0 360 20
Committee 0 360 20
her 0 360 20
client 0 360 20
"wishes 0 360 20
to 0 360 20
testify, 0 360 20
provided 0 360 20
that 0 360 20
we 0 360 20
can 0 360 20
agree 0 360 20
on 0 360 20
terms 0 360 20
that 0 360 20
are 0 360 20
fair 0 360 20
and 0 360 20
which 0 360 20
ensure 0 360 20
her 0 360 20
safety." 0 360 20

Another 0 360 21
Ford 0 360 21
attorney 0 360 21
reportedly 0 360 21
said 0 360 21
Wednesday 0 360 21
that 0 360 21
there 0 360 21
are 0 360 21
“multiple 0 360 21
witnesses” 0 360 21
who 0 360 21
need 0 360 21
to 0 360 21
testify. 0 360 21

"A 0 360 22
hearing 0 360 22
on 0 360 22

insistence 0 360 22
that 0 360 22
it 0 360 22
occur 0 360 22
then 0 360 22
is 0 360 22
arbitrary 0 360 22
in 0 360 22
any 0 360 22
event,” 0 360 22
Katz 0 360 22
wrote 0 360 22
in 0 360 22
a 0 360 22
letter. 0 360 22

“Dr. 0 360 23

Ford 0 360 24
has 0 360 24

GOP 0 360 26
lawmakers 0 360 26
are 0 360 26
figuring 0 360 26
out 0 360 26
how 0 360 26
to 0 360 26

Grassley 0 360 27
(R-Iowa), 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
Judiciary 0 360 27
Committee 0 360 27
chairman, 0 360 27
said 0 360 27
that 0 360 27
his 0 360 27
staff 0 360 27
had 0 360 27
discussed 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
issue 0 360 27
with 0 360 27
Ford’s 0 360 27
attorney 0 360 27
earlier 0 360 27
in 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
day 0 360 27
and 0 360 27
that 0 360 27
he 0 360 27
would 0 360 27
consult 0 360 27
with 0 360 27
his 0 360 27

about 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
next 0 360 27
move. 0 360 27

Ford’s 0 360 28
offer 0 360 28
also 0 360 28
increased 0 360 28
the 0 360 28
pressure 0 360 28
on 0 360 28
several 0 360 28
key 0 360 28

Susan 0 360 29

whose 0 360 29
votes 0 360 29
will 0 360 29
probably 0 360 29
be 0 360 29
needed 0 360 29

put 0 360 29
Kavanaugh 0 360 29
on 0 360 29
the 0 360 29
high 0 360 29
court. 0 360 29

Both 0 360 30
were 0 360 30
already 0 360 30
facing 0 360 30
heavy 0 360 30
pressure 0 360 30
from 0 360 30
abortion 0 360 30
rights 0 360 30
groups 0 360 30

conservative 1 360 30
and 0 360 30
longtime 0 360 30
GOP 0 360 30

might 0 360 30
vote 0 360 30
to 0 360 30
restrict 0 360 30
access 0 360 30

The 0 360 31
sexual 0 360 31
assault 0 360 31
allegation, 0 360 31
which 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
nominee 0 360 31
has 0 360 31
denied, 0 360 31
has 0 360 31
upended 0 360 31
his 0 360 31
seemingly 0 360 31
sure-bet 0 360 31
confirmation 0 360 31
and 0 360 31
only 0 360 31
increased 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
stakes 0 360 31
for 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
key 0 360 31
lawmakers. 0 360 31

Chairman 0 360 32
Grassley 0 360 32
had 0 360 32
imposed 0 360 32
a 0 360 32
Thursday 0 360 32
deadline 0 360 32
for 0 360 32
Ford 0 360 32
to 0 360 32
submit 0 360 32
testimony 0 360 32
after 0 360 32
her 0 360 32
team 0 360 32

Tuesday 0 360 32
she 0 360 32
wasn’t 0 360 32
willing 0 360 32
to 0 360 32

until 0 360 32
the 0 360 32

her 0 360 32

(D-N.Y.) 0 360 33
echoed 0 360 33
Ford’s 0 360 33
demand. 0 360 33

The 0 360 34
demand 0 360 34
for 0 360 34
an 0 360 34
FBI 0 360 34
probe 0 360 34
is 0 360 34
“utter 1 360 34
nonsense,” 1 360 34
former 0 360 34
U.S. 0 360 34
Attorney 0 360 34
Joseph 0 360 34
diGenova 0 360 34
said 0 360 34
earlier 0 360 34
this 0 360 34
week. 0 360 34

Ford 0 360 35
“really 0 360 35
doesn’t 0 360 35
want 0 360 35
to 0 360 35
testify,” 0 360 35
he 0 360 35
said. 0 360 35

“Because 0 360 36
when 0 360 36
she 0 360 36
does, 0 360 36
she 1 360 36
is 1 360 36
going 1 360 36
to 1 360 36
look 1 360 36
like 1 360 36
the 1 360 36
loon 1 360 36
she 1 360 36
is. 1 360 36

She 0 360 37
may 0 360 37
very 0 360 37
well 0 360 37
believe 0 360 37
everything 0 360 37
she’s 0 360 37
saying, 0 360 37
and 0 360 37
that 0 360 37
is 0 360 37
one 0 360 37
of 0 360 37
the 0 360 37
signs 0 360 37
of 0 360 37
lunacy, 0 360 37
believing 0 360 37
something 0 360 37
that 0 360 37
isn’t 0 360 37
real.” 0 360 37
And 0 360 37
her 1 360 37
lawyer 1 360 37
is 1 360 37
“even 1 360 37
loonier.” 1 360 37

Besides, 0 360 38
diGenova 0 360 38
explained, 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
eleventh-hour 0 360 38
sexual 0 360 38
abuse 0 360 38
claim 0 360 38
leveled 0 360 38
against 0 360 38
Kavanaugh 0 360 38
is 0 360 38
a 0 360 38
non-federal 0 360 38
matter 0 360 38
and 0 360 38
in 0 360 38
this 0 360 38
case 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
alleged 0 360 38
assault 0 360 38
hasn’t 0 360 38
even 0 360 38
been 0 360 38
clearly 0 360 38
outlined 0 360 38
by 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
alleged 0 360 38
victim. 0 360 38

Ford 0 360 39
didn’t 0 360 39
report 0 360 39
it 0 360 39
to 0 360 39
anyone 0 360 39
for 0 360 39
decades 0 360 39
and 0 360 39
isn’t 0 360 39
even 0 360 39
certain 0 360 39
when 0 360 39
or 0 360 39
where 0 360 39
it 0 360 39
happened, 0 360 39
so 0 360 39
the 0 360 39
FBI 0 360 39
can’t 0 360 39
investigate 0 360 39
the 0 360 39
matter 0 360 39
“because 0 360 39
there 0 360 39
is 0 360 39
nothing 0 360 39
to 0 360 39
investigate.” 0 360 39

Kavanaugh 0 360 40
has 0 360 40
already 0 360 40
undergone 0 360 40
six 0 360 40

checks 0 360 40

the 0 360 40
agency 0 360 40

ruled 0 360 40
out 0 360 40
investigating 0 360 40
Ford’s 0 360 40
allegation 0 360 40
of 0 360 40
drunken 0 360 40
groping 0 360 40

Ford’s 1 360 41
request 1 360 41
for 1 360 41
an 1 360 41
FBI 1 360 41
probe 1 360 41
is 1 360 41
“clearly 1 360 41
a 1 360 41
desire 1 360 41
to 1 360 41
delay 1 360 41
proceedings,” 1 360 41
diGenova 0 360 41

President 0 360 42

is 0 360 42
taking 0 360 42
the 0 360 42
high 0 360 42
road 0 360 42
and 0 360 42
is 0 360 42
avoiding 0 360 42
attacking 0 360 42
Ford, 0 360 42
which 0 360 42
isn’t 0 360 42
a 0 360 42
risky 0 360 42
move 0 360 42
given 0 360 42
how 0 360 42
obviously 1 360 42
unbalanced 1 360 42
the 1 360 42
accuser 1 360 42
is. 1 360 42

Ford 0 360 43
is 0 360 43
already 0 360 43
doing 0 360 43
an 1 360 43
excellent 1 360 43
job 1 360 43
destroying 1 360 43
herself 1 360 43
without 0 360 43
Republican 0 360 43
assistance. 0 360 43

At 0 360 44
the 0 360 44
White 0 360 44
House 0 360 44
on 0 360 44
Wednesday, 0 360 44
President 0 360 44
Trump 0 360 44
said 0 360 44
it 0 360 44
would 0 360 44
be 0 360 44
"wonderful" 0 360 44
if 0 360 44
Ford 0 360 44
testifies 0 360 44
and 0 360 44
"unfortunate" 0 360 44
if 0 360 44
she 0 360 44

not. 0 360 44

He 0 360 45

he 0 360 45
was 0 360 45
keeping 0 360 45

about 0 360 45
the 0 360 45
allegations 0 360 45
but 0 360 45
that 0 360 45
it 0 360 45
was 0 360 45
"very 0 360 45
hard 0 360 45

between 0 360 45
her 0 360 45

"I 0 360 46

an 1 360 46
extraordinary 1 360 46

– 1 360 46
I 1 360 46
think 1 360 46

you, 1 360 46

he 1 360 46
has 1 360 46
an 1 360 46
unblemished 1 360 46
record," 1 360 46
Trump 0 360 46
said. 0 360 46

"This 0 360 47
is 0 360 47
a 0 360 47
very 0 360 47
tough 0 360 47

for 0 360 47
him 0 360 47
and 0 360 47
his 0 360 47

we 0 360 47

over 0 360 47
it 0 360 47

at 0 360 47

A 0 364 0
Good 0 364 0
Thing 0 364 0
- 0 364 0
Here's 0 364 0
Why 0 364 0

If 0 364 1
you 0 364 1
don’t 0 364 1
like 0 364 1
President 0 364 1
Trump 0 364 1
and 0 364 1
can’t 0 364 1
understand 0 364 1
how 0 364 1
anyone 0 364 1
could, 0 364 1
look 0 364 1
no 0 364 1
further 0 364 1
than 0 364 1
the 0 364 1
past 0 364 1
week 0 364 1
for 0 364 1
an 0 364 1
excellent 0 364 1
example 0 364 1
of 0 364 1
what 1 364 1
on 1 364 1
Earth 1 364 1
could’ve 0 364 1
made 0 364 1
a 1 364 1
man 1 364 1
promising 1 364 1
to 1 364 1
Drain 1 364 1
the 1 364 1
Swamp 1 364 1
so 0 364 1
popular. 0 364 1

The 0 364 2
Washington 0 364 2
establishment 0 364 2
politicians 0 364 2
act 1 364 2
like 1 364 2
children 1 364 2
when 0 364 2
they 0 364 2
can’t 0 364 2
have 0 364 2
their 0 364 2
way. 0 364 2

They 1 364 3
kick 1 364 3
and 1 364 3
scream 1 364 3
and 1 364 3
lie 1 364 3
and 1 364 3
pout. 1 364 3

President 1 364 4
Trump 1 364 4
is 1 364 4
the 1 364 4
anti-politician 1 364 4
and 0 364 4
when 0 364 4
Congress 0 364 4
continues 0 364 4
to 0 364 4
behave 0 364 4
like 0 364 4
this, 0 364 4
he 0 364 4
only 0 364 4
gets 0 364 4
more 0 364 4
popular. 0 364 4

President 0 364 5
Trump 0 364 5
nominated 0 364 5
Bret 0 364 5
Kavanaugh 0 364 5
to 0 364 5
the 0 364 5
supreme 0 364 5
court. 0 364 5

He’s 0 364 6
a 0 364 6
pro-life 1 364 6
judge 1 364 6
and 0 364 6
his 0 364 6
vote 0 364 6
will 0 364 6
certainly 0 364 6
tip 0 364 6
the 0 364 6
scales 0 364 6
of 0 364 6
justice 0 364 6
to 0 364 6
the 0 364 6
right. 0 364 6

The 0 364 7
power 0 364 7
that 0 364 7
the 0 364 7
Supreme 0 364 7
Court 0 364 7
has, 0 364 7
some 0 364 7
would 0 364 7
argue, 0 364 7
is 0 364 7
greater 0 364 7
in 0 364 7
certain 0 364 7
aspects 0 364 7
than 0 364 7
that 0 364 7
of 0 364 7
the 0 364 7
president 0 364 7
himself. 0 364 7

Perhaps 0 364 8
that’s 0 364 8
why 0 364 8
the 0 364 8
2016 0 364 8
election 0 364 8
loss 0 364 8
was 0 364 8
so 0 364 8
devastating 1 364 8
to 0 364 8
the 0 364 8
Democrats. 0 364 8

Trump 0 364 9
potentially 0 364 9
has 0 364 9
the 0 364 9
ability 0 364 9
to 0 364 9
nominate 0 364 9
3 0 364 9
Supreme 0 364 9
Court 0 364 9
justices 0 364 9
during 0 364 9
his 0 364 9
presidency, 0 364 9
thus 0 364 9
shaping 0 364 9
the 0 364 9
laws 0 364 9
and 0 364 9
morals 0 364 9
of 0 364 9
this 0 364 9
country 0 364 9
for 0 364 9
about 0 364 9
the 0 364 9
next 0 364 9
30 0 364 9
years. 0 364 9

Personally, 1 364 10
I 1 364 10
trust 1 364 10
very, 1 364 10
very 1 364 10
few 1 364 10
politicians 1 364 10
no 1 364 10
matter 1 364 10
the 1 364 10
party 1 364 10
that 1 364 10
they 1 364 10
claim. 1 364 10

So, 0 364 11
when 0 364 11
a 1 364 11
bunch 1 364 11
of 1 364 11
well-documented 1 364 11
liars 1 364 11
come 0 364 11
out 0 364 11
with 0 364 11
yet 0 364 11

Ford 0 364 24
recalled 0 364 24
the 0 364 24
incident 0 364 24
in 0 364 24
2006 0 364 24

She's 0 364 25
known 0 364 25
about 0 364 25
this 0 364 25
for 0 364 25
over 0 364 25
ten 0 364 25
years, 0 364 25
why 0 364 25
come 0 364 25
forward 0 364 25
now? 0 364 25

She's 0 364 26
affiliated 0 364 26
with 0 364 26
the 0 364 26
democratic 0 364 26
party 0 364 26
and 0 364 26
the 0 364 26
“resist” 0 364 26
movement 0 364 26

She 0 364 27
hired 0 364 27
a 0 364 27
Clinton 0 364 27
attorney, 0 364 27
Lisa 0 364 27
Banks 0 364 27

She 0 364 28
can 0 364 28
produce 0 364 28
exactly 0 364 28
zero 0 364 28
witnesses 0 364 28

Any 0 364 29
one 0 364 29
of 0 364 29
these 0 364 29
(and 0 364 29
dozens 0 364 29
of 0 364 29
other) 0 364 29
circumstances 0 364 29
by 0 364 29
themselves 0 364 29
are 0 364 29
not 0 364 29
enough 0 364 29
to 0 364 29
dismiss 0 364 29
this 0 364 29
allegation 0 364 29
outright. 0 364 29

However, 0 364 30
taken 1 364 30
together 1 364 30
as 1 364 30
a 1 364 30
whole, 1 364 30
it’s 1 364 30
far 1 364 30
too 1 364 30
suspicious 1 364 30
to 1 364 30
lend 1 364 30
it 1 364 30
any 1 364 30
credibility. 1 364 30

Ladies, 0 364 31
you 0 364 31
demand 0 364 31
to 0 364 31
be 0 364 31
believed, 0 364 31
no 0 364 31
matter 0 364 31
what. 0 364 31

Well, 0 364 32
when 0 364 32
every 1 364 32
time 1 364 32
there's 1 364 32
a 1 364 32
man 1 364 32
that 1 364 32
you 1 364 32
don't 1 364 32
like 1 364 32
running 1 364 32
for 1 364 32
public 1 364 32
office 1 364 32
or 1 364 32
being 1 364 32
nominated 1 364 32
for 1 364 32
a 1 364 32
position, 1 364 32
some 1 364 32
woman 1 364 32
crawls 1 364 32
out 1 364 32
from 1 364 32
a 1 364 32
line 1 364 32
of 1 364 32
protesters 1 364 32
and 1 364 32
makes 1 364 32
an 1 364 32
ambiguous-at-best 1 364 32
claim 1 364 32
about 1 364 32
unwanted 1 364 32
sexual 1 364 32
advances, 1 364 32
it 0 364 32
becomes 0 364 32
increasingly 0 364 32
difficult 0 364 32
to 0 364 32
take 0 364 32
you 0 364 32
seriously. 0 364 32

No, 0 364 33
an 0 364 33
accusation 0 364 33
against 0 364 33
a 0 364 33
man 0 364 33
who 0 364 33
has 0 364 33
been 0 364 33
investigated 0 364 33
by 0 364 33
the 0 364 33
FBI 0 364 33
six 0 364 33
times 0 364 33
prior 0 364 33
and 0 364 33
has 0 364 33
75 0 364 33
women 0 364 33
publicly 0 364 33
vouching 0 364 33
for 0 364 33
his 0 364 33
character 0 364 33
is 0 364 33
not 0 364 33
going 0 364 33
to 0 364 33
stop 0 364 33
this 0 364 33
process. 0 364 33

And 0 364 34
guess 0 364 34
what, 0 364 34
next 1 364 34
time 1 364 34
a 1 364 34
man 1 364 34
is 1 364 34
nominated 1 364 34
to 1 364 34
a 1 364 34
position 1 364 34
who 1 364 34
really 1 364 34
has 1 364 34
committed 1 364 34
a 1 364 34
crime, 1 364 34
people 1 364 34
will 1 364 34
be 1 364 34
that 1 364 34
much 1 364 34
less 1 364 34
likely 1 364 34
to 1 364 34
believe 1 364 34
his 1 364 34
accuser. 1 364 34

Way 1 364 35
to 1 364 35
go! 1 364 35

By 0 364 36
attempting 0 364 36
to 0 364 36
derail 0 364 36
this 0 364 36
process 0 364 36
with 0 364 36
such 1 364 36
a 1 364 36
pathetic 1 364 36
attempt 1 364 36
at 1 364 36
a 1 364 36
smear 1 364 36
campaign, 1 364 36
you 0 364 36
have 0 364 36
successfully 0 364 36
made 0 364 36
it 0 364 36
much 0 364 36
easier 0 364 36
for 0 364 36
a 0 364 36
real 0 364 36
sex 0 364 36
offender 0 364 36
to 0 364 36
point 0 364 36
back 0 364 36
at 0 364 36
this 0 364 36
and 0 364 36
say, 0 364 36
“look, 0 364 36
this 0 364 36
is 0 364 36
what 0 364 36
they 0 364 36
do"! 0 364 36

Women 1 364 37
everywhere 1 364 37
should 1 364 37
be 1 364 37
furious. 1 364 37

As 0 364 38
an 0 364 38
outsider, 0 364 38
a 0 364 38
regular 1 364 38
Joe 1 364 38
American, 1 364 38
this 0 364 38
is 0 364 38
what 0 364 38
I 0 364 38
see: 0 364 38
Trump 0 364 38
nominates 0 364 38
a 0 364 38
very 0 364 38
well 0 364 38
known, 0 364 38
well-established 0 364 38
judge 0 364 38
to 0 364 38
the 0 364 38
supreme 0 364 38
court. 0 364 38

Immediately 0 364 39
every 0 364 39
Democrat 0 364 39
publicly 0 364 39
stated 0 364 39
that 0 364 39
they 0 364 39
would 0 364 39
vote 0 364 39
No 0 364 39
for 0 364 39
his 0 364 39
confirmation. 0 364 39

On 0 364 40
the 0 364 40
other 0 364 40
hand, 0 364 40
every 0 364 40
Republican 0 364 40
publicly 0 364 40
stated 0 364 40
that 0 364 40
they 0 364 40
would 0 364 40
vote 0 364 40
Yes. 0 364 40

Currently, 0 364 41
there's 0 364 41
more 0 364 41
Republicans 0 364 41
in 0 364 41
Congress 0 364 41
than 0 364 41
Democrats, 0 364 41
which 0 364 41
means 0 364 41
the 0 364 41
guy 0 364 41
will 0 364 41
be 0 364 41
confirmed. 0 364 41

There's 0 364 42
an 0 364 42
election 0 364 42
2 0 364 42
months 0 364 42
away. 0 364 42

The 0 364 43
Democrats 0 364 43
think 0 364 43
that 0 364 43
they'll 0 364 43
take 0 364 43
back 0 364 43
the 0 364 43
majority 0 364 43
of 0 364 43
Congress 0 364 43
and 0 364 43
will 0 364 43
thus 0 364 43
be 0 364 43
able 0 364 43
to 0 364 43
block 0 364 43
Trump's 0 364 43
nomination. 0 364 43

All 0 364 44
they 0 364 44
have 0 364 44
to 0 364 44
do 0 364 44
is 0 364 44
delay 0 364 44
the 0 364 44
confirmation 0 364 44
until 0 364 44
after 0 364 44
the 0 364 44
election. 0 364 44

So, 0 364 45
they 1 364 45
dig 1 364 45
up 1 364 45
some 1 364 45
Trump-hating 1 364 45
woman 1 364 45
from 1 364 45
Kavanaugh’s 1 364 45
past 1 364 45
and 1 364 45
convince 1 364 45
her 1 364 45
to 1 364 45
say 1 364 45
that 1 364 45
he 1 364 45
assaulted 1 364 45
her 1 364 45
thinking 1 364 45
that 1 364 45
such 1 364 45
an 1 364 45
allegation 1 364 45
will 1 364 45
surely 1 364 45
delay 1 364 45
the 1 364 45
vote 1 364 45
long 1 364 45
enough 1 364 45
for 1 364 45
them 1 364 45
to 1 364 45
regain 1 364 45
control 1 364 45
of 1 364 45
Congress. 1 364 45

It’s 0 364 46
not 0 364 46
difficult 0 364 46
to 0 364 46
see 0 364 46
through 0 364 46
this 0 364 46
plan. 0 364 46

These 0 364 47
are 0 364 47
the 0 364 47
facts. 0 364 47

This 0 364 48
is 0 364 48
not 0 364 48
my 0 364 48
opinion. 0 364 48

Everything 1 364 48

else 1 364 48

is 1 364 48

just 1 364 48

noise. 1 364 48

the 0 367 1

for 0 367 1
no 0 367 1
reason, 0 367 1
is 0 367 1
a 0 367 1

of 0 367 1

at 0 367 1
work 0 367 1
in 0 367 1

Guyger 0 367 2
claims 0 367 2
that 0 367 2
she 0 367 2
accidentally 0 367 2
entered 0 367 2
the 0 367 2
wrong 0 367 2
apartment 0 367 2
and 0 367 2
shot 0 367 2
a 0 367 2
man 0 367 2
who 0 367 2
she 0 367 2
thought 0 367 2
was 0 367 2
a 0 367 2
burglar, 0 367 2
however, 0 367 2
eyewitness 0 367 2
testimony 0 367 2
has 0 367 2
contradicted 0 367 2
her 0 367 2
initial 0 367 2
statement. 0 367 2

Despite 0 367 3
admitting 0 367 3
to 0 367 3
killing 0 367 3
an 0 367 3
innocent 1 367 3
man 0 367 3
and 0 367 3
having 0 367 3
her 0 367 3
initial 0 367 3
statement 0 367 3
contradicted 0 367 3
by 0 367 3
witness 0 367 3
testimony, 0 367 3
Guyger 0 367 3
has 0 367 3
been 0 367 3
treated 0 367 3
as 0 367 3
more 0 367 3
of 0 367 3
a 0 367 3
victim 0 367 3
than 0 367 3
a 0 367 3
killer. 0 367 3

In 0 367 4
fact, 0 367 4
Guyger’s 0 367 4
apartment 0 367 4
was 0 367 4
never 0 367 4
even 0 367 4
searched 0 367 4
for 0 367 4
evidence, 0 367 4
and 0 367 4
she 0 367 4
was 0 367 4
allowed 0 367 4
to 0 367 4
“vacate” 0 367 4
the 0 367 4
premises 0 367 4
without 0 367 4
any 0 367 4
type 0 367 4
of 0 367 4
search. 0 367 4

By 0 367 5
not 0 367 5
searching 0 367 5
her 0 367 5
apartment 0 367 5
immediately, 0 367 5
police 0 367 5
ruined 0 367 5
the 0 367 5

would 0 367 6

attempted 0 367 18

somehow 0 367 18
justify 0 367 18
the 0 367 18

It 0 367 19
is 0 367 19
obvious 0 367 19
in 0 367 19
this 0 367 19
case 0 367 19
that 0 367 19
Guyger 0 367 19

receiving 0 367 19
special 0 367 19

not 0 367 19
only 0 367 19
did 0 367 19
she 0 367 19
get 0 367 19
away 0 367 19
without 0 367 19
a 0 367 19

but 0 367 19
she 0 367 19
turned 0 367 19
herself 0 367 19
in 0 367 19
at 0 367 19
her 0 367 19
own 0 367 19
convenience 0 367 19
and 0 367 19
was 0 367 19
let 0 367 19
out 0 367 19
two 0 367 19

receive 0 367 20
this 0 367 20
type 0 367 20
of 0 367 20
treatment 0 367 20
if 0 367 20
they 0 367 20
just 0 367 20
admitted 0 367 20
to 0 367 20
killing 0 367 20
an 0 367 20

that 0 367 21

has 0 367 21
been 0 367 21
charged 0 367 21
with 0 367 21
manslaughter 0 367 21
instead 0 367 21
of 0 367 21
murder, 0 367 21
which 0 367 21
will 0 367 21
make 0 367 21
it 0 367 21
possible 0 367 21
for 0 367 21
her 0 367 21

cringe. 1 369 11

All 0 369 12
the 1 369 12
Dems 1 369 12
have 0 369 12
to 0 369 12
do 0 369 12
is 1 369 12
squeal 1 369 12
“sexism” 0 369 12
and 0 369 12
Republicans 0 369 12
start 0 369 12
negotiating 0 369 12
and 0 369 12
offering 0 369 12
concessions. 0 369 12

Of 0 369 13
course, 0 369 13
after 0 369 13
each 0 369 13
concession 0 369 13
comes 0 369 13
another 0 369 13
demand. 0 369 13

First 0 369 14
the 1 369 14
Dems 1 369 14
demanded 0 369 14
that 0 369 14
Ford, 0 369 14
a 0 369 14
long-time 0 369 14
Democrat 0 369 14
activist, 0 369 14
“be 0 369 14
heard.” 0 369 14
So 0 369 14
last 0 369 14
week 0 369 14
the 0 369 14
Chairman 0 369 14
of 0 369 14
Judiciary 0 369 14
Committee, 0 369 14
Chuck 0 369 14
Grassley, 0 369 14
granted 0 369 14
another 0 369 14
deadline 0 369 14
extension 0 369 14
for 0 369 14
Ford 0 369 14
to 0 369 14
decide 0 369 14
whether 0 369 14
to 0 369 14
testify 0 369 14
before 0 369 14
the 0 369 14
Committee 0 369 14
on 0 369 14
Monday. 0 369 14

Senator 0 369 15
Dianne 0 369 15
Feinstein 0 369 15
calls 0 369 15
these 0 369 15
concessions 0 369 15
“bullying 1 369 15
deadlines.” 1 369 15
As 0 369 15
Feinstein 0 369 15
put 0 369 15
it, 0 369 15
“Show 0 369 15
some 0 369 15
heart. 0 369 15

Wait 0 369 16
until 0 369 16
Dr. 0 369 16
Ford 0 369 16
feels 0 369 16
that 0 369 16
she 0 369 16
can 0 369 16
come 0 369 16
before 0 369 16
the 0 369 16
committee.” 0 369 16
Ford 0 369 16
doesn’t 0 369 16
“feel” 0 369 16
like 0 369 16
she 0 369 16
can 0 369 16
testify 0 369 16
on 0 369 16
Monday 0 369 16
because 0 369 16
she’s 0 369 16
afraid 0 369 16
of 0 369 16
flying, 0 369 16
despite 0 369 16
offers 0 369 16
from 0 369 16
the 0 369 16
Committee 0 369 16
to 0 369 16
travel 0 369 16
to 0 369 16
her 0 369 16
in 0 369 16
California. 0 369 16

Then 0 369 17
she 0 369 17
feared 0 369 17
for 0 369 17
her 0 369 17
life 0 369 17
because 0 369 17
of 0 369 17
death 0 369 17
threats 0 369 17
––threats 0 369 17
also 0 369 17
made 0 369 17
to 0 369 17
Kavanaugh, 0 369 17
his 0 369 17
wife 0 369 17
and 0 369 17
two 0 369 17
young 0 369 17
daughters–– 0 369 17
so 0 369 17
she 0 369 17
now 0 369 17
demands 0 369 17
enhanced 0 369 17
security 0 369 17
measures. 0 369 17

The 0 369 18
Committee 0 369 18
caved 0 369 18
and 0 369 18
moved 0 369 18
the 0 369 18
date 0 369 18
to 0 369 18
Thursday. 0 369 18

So 0 369 19
of 0 369 19
course, 0 369 19
Grassley 0 369 19
having 0 369 19
been 0 369 19
intimidated 0 369 19
into 0 369 19
giving 0 369 19
Ford 0 369 19
a 0 369 19
chance 0 369 19
to 0 369 19
address 0 369 19
the 0 369 19
Committee, 0 369 19
Ramirez 0 369 19
and 0 369 19
her 0 369 19
handlers 0 369 19
are 0 369 19
now 0 369 19
demanding 0 369 19
the 0 369 19
same 0 369 19
privilege. 0 369 19

“Creepy 1 369 20
Lawyer” 1 369 20
for 0 369 20
porn 0 369 20
star 0 369 20
Stormy 0 369 20
Daniels 0 369 20
claims 0 369 20
to 0 369 20
represent 0 369 20
a 0 369 20
woman 0 369 20
who 0 369 20
also 0 369 20
should 0 369 20
be 0 369 20
allowed 0 369 20
to 0 369 20
testify 0 369 20
to 0 369 20
the 0 369 20
Senate 0 369 20
Committee 0 369 20
about 0 369 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 369 20
partying 0 369 20
habits 0 369 20
while 0 369 20
at 0 369 20
Yale. 0 369 20

We’ll 0 369 21
have 0 369 21
to 0 369 21
see 0 369 21
whether 0 369 21
Grassley 0 369 21
can 0 369 21
find 1 369 21
the 1 369 21
stomach 1 369 21
to 1 369 21
put 1 369 21
an 1 369 21
end 1 369 21
to 1 369 21
the 1 369 21
farce 1 369 21
of 0 369 21
allowing 0 369 21
unsubstantiated 0 369 21
charges 0 369 21
from 0 369 21
Democrat 0 369 21
activists 0 369 21
to 0 369 21
waste 0 369 21
the 0 369 21
Committee’s 0 369 21
time. 0 369 21

Ford 0 369 22
and 0 369 22
Dianne 0 369 22
Feinstein 0 369 22
also 0 369 22
keep 0 369 22
demanding 0 369 22
an 0 369 22
FBI 0 369 22
investigation, 0 369 22
even 0 369 22
though 0 369 22
no 0 369 22
federal 0 369 22
crime 0 369 22
is 0 369 22
being 0 369 22
alleged, 0 369 22
and 0 369 22
any 0 369 22
investigation 0 369 22
36 0 369 22
years 0 369 22
after 0 369 22
the 0 369 22
offense 0 369 22
is 0 369 22
impossible. 0 369 22

Ford 0 369 23
can’t 0 369 23
remember 0 369 23
where 0 369 23
and 0 369 23
when 0 369 23
the 0 369 23
alleged 0 369 23
assault 0 369 23
took 0 369 23
place, 0 369 23
nor 0 369 23
how 0 369 23
she 0 369 23
got 0 369 23
to 0 369 23
or 0 369 23
went 0 369 23
home 0 369 23
from 0 369 23
the 0 369 23
party 0 369 23
where 0 369 23
it 0 369 23
allegedly 0 369 23
occurred. 0 369 23

Her 1 369 24
own 1 369 24
details 1 369 24
of 1 369 24
the 1 369 24
event 1 369 24
don’t 1 369 24
jibe 1 369 24
(Four 1 369 24
boys 1 369 24
or 1 369 24
three? 1 369 24

One 1 369 25
girl 1 369 25
or 1 369 25
two?). 1 369 25

She 0 369 26
told 0 369 26
no 0 369 26
one 0 369 26
about 0 369 26
the 0 369 26
assault 0 369 26
until 0 369 26
30 0 369 26
years 0 369 26
later. 0 369 26

A 0 369 27
“lifelong 0 369 27
friend” 0 369 27
whom 0 369 27
Ford 0 369 27
claims 0 369 27
was 0 369 27
at 0 369 27
the 0 369 27
party 0 369 27
has 0 369 27
denied 0 369 27
any 0 369 27
knowledge 0 369 27
of 0 369 27
the 0 369 27
it, 0 369 27
and 0 369 27
says 0 369 27
she’s 0 369 27
never 0 369 27
met 0 369 27
Kavanaugh. 0 369 27

Another 0 369 28
friend 0 369 28
who 0 369 28
reported 0 369 28
that 0 369 28
the 0 369 28
school 0 369 28
was 0 369 28
abuzz 0 369 28
with 0 369 28
gossip 0 369 28
about 0 369 28
the 0 369 28
attack 0 369 28
(which 0 369 28
apparently 0 369 28
took 0 369 28
place 0 369 28
during 0 369 28
summer 0 369 28
break), 0 369 28
retracted 0 369 28
her 0 369 28
statement. 0 369 28

The 0 369 29
two 0 369 29
men 0 369 29
Ford 0 369 29
named 0 369 29
as 0 369 29
possible 0 369 29
witnesses 0 369 29
to 0 369 29
the 0 369 29
assault 0 369 29
have 0 369 29
contradicter 0 369 29
her 0 369 29
claims 0 369 29
under 0 369 29
oath. 0 369 29

And 0 369 30
the 0 369 30
accused 0 369 30
Judge 0 369 30
Kavanaugh 0 369 30
also 0 369 30
under 0 369 30
oath 0 369 30
vehemently 1 369 30
denies 1 369 30
the 0 369 30
charges. 0 369 30

Given 0 369 31
that 0 369 31
36 0 369 31
years 0 369 31
have 0 369 31
passed 0 369 31
since 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
incident, 0 369 31
and 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
accuser’s 0 369 31
memory 0 369 31
is 0 369 31
so 0 369 31
hazy 0 369 31
and 0 369 31
short 0 369 31
on 0 369 31
coherent 0 369 31
details, 0 369 31
the 0 369 31
FBI 0 369 31
has 0 369 31
nothing 0 369 31
to 0 369 31
investigate. 0 369 31

Ramirez’s 0 369 32
charge 0 369 32
is 0 369 32
even 0 369 32
flimsier. 0 369 32

Here’s 0 369 33
a 0 369 33
catalogue 0 369 33
from 0 369 33

The 0 369 35
New 0 369 35

not 0 369 35
find 0 369 35
a 0 369 35
single 0 369 35
witness 0 369 35
who 0 369 35
could 0 369 35
put 0 369 35
Kavanaugh 0 369 35
at 0 369 35
the 0 369 35
alleged 0 369 35
party. 0 369 35

a 0 369 37
single 0 369 37
person 0 369 37
who 0 369 37
could 0 369 37
corroborate 0 369 37
Ramirez’s 0 369 37
claims. 0 369 37

3. 0 369 38

The 0 369 39
man 0 369 39
accused 0 369 39
of 0 369 39
egging 0 369 39
on 0 369 39
Kavanaugh 0 369 39
denied 0 369 39
Ramirez's 0 369 39
allegations 0 369 39
and 0 369 39
vouched 0 369 39
for 0 369 39
Kavanaugh’s 0 369 39
character. 0 369 39

4. 0 369 40

A 0 369 41
third 0 369 41
person 0 369 41
that 0 369 41
Ramirez 0 369 41
claimed 0 369 41
was 0 369 41
at 0 369 41
the 0 369 41
party 0 369 41
says 0 369 41
she 0 369 41
was 0 369 41
not 0 369 41
there 0 369 41
for 0 369 41
the 0 369 41
alleged 0 369 41
incident. 0 369 41

5. 0 369 42

Ramirez 0 369 43
contacted 0 369 43
her 0 369 43
former 0 369 43
classmates, 0 369 43
asking 0 369 43
about 0 369 43
the 0 369 43
incident, 0 369 43
and 0 369 43
admitted 0 369 43
she 0 369 43
was 0 369 43
not 0 369 43
sure 0 369 43
that 0 369 43
Kavanaugh 0 369 43
was 0 369 43
the 0 369 43
male 0 369 43
who 0 369 43
exposed 0 369 43
himself. 0 369 43

6. 0 369 44

A 0 369 45
woman 0 369 45
who 0 369 45
claims 0 369 45
she 0 369 45
was 0 369 45
“best 0 369 45
friends” 0 369 45
with 0 369 45
Ramirez 0 369 45
says 0 369 45
Ramirez 0 369 45
never 0 369 45
mentioned 0 369 45
the 0 369 45
story 0 369 45
and 0 369 45
initially 0 369 45
said 0 369 45
her 0 369 45
friend's 0 369 45
accusations 0 369 45
against 0 369 45
Kavanaugh 0 369 45
might 0 369 45
be 0 369 45
“politically 0 369 45
motivated.” 0 369 45

7. 0 369 46

Ramirez, 0 369 47
just 0 369 47
like 0 369 47
Christine 0 369 47
Blasey 0 369 47
Ford, 0 369 47
is 0 369 47
a 0 369 47
registered 0 369 47
Democrat 0 369 47
and 0 369 47
is 0 369 47
dedicated 0 369 47
to 0 369 47
leftist 0 369 47
causes. 0 369 47

8. 0 369 48

Ramirez 0 369 49
wasn’t 0 369 49
even 0 369 49
sure 0 369 49
her 0 369 49
memory 0 369 49
was 0 369 49
correct 0 369 49
— 0 369 49
until 0 369 49
she 0 369 49
spent 0 369 49
six 0 369 49
days 0 369 49
going 0 369 49
over 0 369 49
it 0 369 49
with 0 369 49
her 1 369 49
Democrat 1 369 49
lawyer. 1 369 49

9. 0 369 50

Ramirez 0 369 51
admits 0 369 51
there 0 369 51
are 0 369 51
holes 0 369 51
in 0 369 51
her 0 369 51
memory 0 369 51
due 0 369 51
to 0 369 51
how 0 369 51
much 0 369 51
she 0 369 51
drank 0 369 51
at 0 369 51
the 0 369 51
party. 0 369 51

10. 0 369 52

People 0 369 53
who 0 369 53
knew 0 369 53
Ramirez 0 369 53
after 0 369 53
her 0 369 53
time 0 369 53
at 0 369 53
Yale 0 369 53
say 0 369 53
that 0 369 53
she 0 369 53
never 0 369 53
once 0 369 53
mentioned 0 369 53
the 0 369 53
incident 0 369 53
— 0 369 53
until 0 369 53
Kavanaugh's 0 369 53
nomination 0 369 53
was 0 369 53
pending. 0 369 53

No 0 369 54
law 0 369 54
enforcement 0 369 54
agency, 0 369 54
let 0 369 54
alone 0 369 54
the 0 369 54
FBI, 0 369 54
would 0 369 54
waste 0 369 54
its 0 369 54
time 0 369 54
with 0 369 54
an 0 369 54
allegation 0 369 54
of 0 369 54
a 0 369 54
crime 0 369 54
decades 0 369 54
in 0 369 54
the 0 369 54
past, 0 369 54
and 0 369 54
so 0 369 54
patently 0 369 54
incoherent 0 369 54
and 0 369 54
lacking 0 369 54
in 0 369 54
evidence. 0 369 54

The 0 369 55
“FBI 0 369 55
investigation” 0 369 55
is 0 369 55
another 0 369 55
delaying 0 369 55
tactic. 0 369 55

Ford 0 369 56
has 0 369 56
finally 0 369 56
agreed 0 369 56
to 0 369 56
testify, 0 369 56
set 0 369 56
for 0 369 56
Thursday 0 369 56
for 0 369 56
now. 0 369 56

But 0 369 57
it’s 0 369 57
unclear 0 369 57
whether 0 369 57
Grassley 0 369 57
has 0 369 57
granted 0 369 57
Ford 0 369 57
any 0 369 57
of 0 369 57
her 0 369 57
preposterous 1 369 57
conditions 1 369 57
for 0 369 57
testifying: 0 369 57
She 0 369 57
will 0 369 57
take 0 369 57
questions 0 369 57
from 0 369 57
the 0 369 57
Committee, 0 369 57
but 0 369 57
not 0 369 57
from 0 369 57
outside 0 369 57
lawyers, 0 369 57
who 0 369 57
might 0 369 57
not 0 369 57
be 0 369 57
as 0 369 57
gentle 0 369 57
as 0 369 57
politicians 1 369 57
with 1 369 57
one 1 369 57
eye 1 369 57
on 1 369 57
the 1 369 57
polls. 1 369 57

Only 0 369 58
one 0 369 58
camera 0 369 58
can 0 369 58
be 0 369 58
in 0 369 58
the 0 369 58
room. 0 369 58

Kavanaugh 0 369 59
must 0 369 59
testify 0 369 59
first, 0 369 59
a 1 369 59
grotesque 1 369 59
inversion 1 369 59
of 0 369 59
our 1 369 59
bedrock 1 369 59
principle 1 369 59
that 1 369 59
an 1 369 59
accused 1 369 59
has 1 369 59
the 1 369 59
right 1 369 59
to 1 369 59
confront 1 369 59
his 1 369 59
accuser’s 1 369 59
charges. 1 369 59

He 0 369 60
can’t 0 369 60
be 0 369 60
in 0 369 60
the 0 369 60
room 0 369 60
with 0 369 60
her, 0 369 60
apparently 0 369 60
because 0 369 60
she’s 0 369 60
still 0 369 60
traumatized 0 369 60
and 0 369 60
may 0 369 60
start 0 369 60
experiencing 0 369 60
flashbacks. 0 369 60

So 0 369 61
much 0 369 61
for 0 369 61
“I 0 369 61
am 1 369 61
woman, 1 369 61
hear 1 369 61
me 1 369 61
roar.” 1 369 61

Grassley 0 369 62
shouldn’t 0 369 62
cave 0 369 62
on 0 369 62
these 0 369 62
conditions. 0 369 62

They 0 369 63
all 0 369 63
comprise 0 369 63
the 0 369 63
old 0 369 63
tactic 0 369 63
of 0 369 63
serially 0 369 63
escalating 0 369 63
demands 0 369 63
that 0 369 63
cannot 0 369 63
be 0 369 63
satisfied 0 369 63
in 0 369 63
order 0 369 63
to 0 369 63
compel 0 369 63
your 0 369 63
enemy 0 369 63
to 0 369 63
give 0 369 63
in. 0 369 63

That 0 369 64
Grassley 0 369 64
and 0 369 64
the 0 369 64
Republicans 0 369 64
would 0 369 64
even 0 369 64
participate 0 369 64
in 0 369 64
this 0 369 64
absurd 1 369 64
show 1 369 64
trial 1 369 64
is 0 369 64
testimony 0 369 64
to 0 369 64
how 0 369 64
deeply 0 369 64
the 0 369 64
progressive 0 369 64
ideological 0 369 64
narrative 0 369 64
has 0 369 64
burrowed 0 369 64
into 0 369 64
our 0 369 64
social 0 369 64
and 0 369 64
political 0 369 64
life. 0 369 64

If 0 369 65
Ford 0 369 65
actually 0 369 65
testifies 0 369 65
on 0 369 65
Thursday, 0 369 65
or 0 369 65
Ramirez 0 369 65
is 0 369 65
granted 0 369 65
the 0 369 65
same 0 369 65
concession, 0 369 65
nothing 0 369 65
material 0 369 65
will 0 369 65
be 0 369 65
gained. 0 369 65

Her 0 369 66
accusation 0 369 66
will 0 369 66
not 0 369 66
be 0 369 66
proved 0 369 66
true 0 369 66
or 0 369 66
false. 0 369 66

We 0 369 67
will 0 369 67
learn 0 369 67
nothing 0 369 67
about 0 369 67
Kavanaugh 0 369 67
that 0 369 67
makes 0 369 67
him 0 369 67
any 0 369 67
less 0 369 67
eminently 0 369 67
qualified 0 369 67
for 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
Supreme 0 369 67
Court, 0 369 67
nothing 0 369 67
that 0 369 67
can 0 369 67
add 0 369 67
to 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
thousands 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
pages 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
documents 0 369 67
already 0 369 67
presented 0 369 67
to 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
Committee, 0 369 67
or 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
hundreds 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
hours 0 369 67
of 0 369 67
the 0 369 67
judge’s 0 369 67
testimony 0 369 67
before 0 369 67
rabid 1 369 67
partisans 1 369 67
and 1 369 67
office-seekers. 1 369 67

But 0 369 68
vetting 0 369 68
Kavanaugh’s 0 369 68
qualifications 0 369 68
isn’t 0 369 68
the 0 369 68
point. 0 369 68

The 0 369 69
point 0 369 69
is 0 369 69
to 0 369 69
delay 0 369 69
confirmation 0 369 69
by 0 369 69
slandering 0 369 69
Kavanaugh 0 369 69
and 0 369 69
baiting 0 369 69
the 0 369 69
Republicans 0 369 69
into 0 369 69
appearing 0 369 69
to 0 369 69
abuse 0 369 69
victims 0 369 69
of 0 369 69
sexual 0 369 69
assault. 0 369 69

Why? 0 369 70

Facing 0 369 71
his 0 369 71
likely 0 369 71
confirmation, 0 369 71
the 1 369 71
Dems, 1 369 71
egged 0 369 71
on 0 369 71
by 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
mainstream 0 369 71
media––especially 0 369 71
The 0 369 71
New 0 369 71
Yorker, 0 369 71
which 0 369 71
published 0 369 71
a 0 369 71
story 0 369 71
too 0 369 71
badly 0 369 71
sourced 0 369 71
even 0 369 71
for 0 369 71
The 0 369 71
New 0 369 71
York 0 369 71
Times–– 0 369 71
are 0 369 71
desperately 0 369 71
attempting 0 369 71
to 0 369 71
obstruct 0 369 71
and 0 369 71
delay 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
process 0 369 71
until 0 369 71
after 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
midterm 0 369 71
elections, 0 369 71
when 0 369 71
they 0 369 71
hope 0 369 71
they 0 369 71
will 0 369 71
retake 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
Senate 0 369 71
and 0 369 71
thus 0 369 71
stop 0 369 71
any 0 369 71
more 0 369 71
Constitutionalist 0 369 71
judges 0 369 71
from 0 369 71
being 0 369 71
confirmed 0 369 71
to 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
Court 0 369 71
for 0 369 71
the 0 369 71
rest 0 369 71
of 0 369 71
Trump’s 0 369 71
term. 0 369 71

The 0 369 72
Democrats 0 369 72
have 0 369 72
stooped 1 369 72
so 1 369 72
low 1 369 72
with 1 369 72
these 1 369 72
smears 1 369 72
because 0 369 72
they 0 369 72
know 0 369 72
the 0 369 72
stakes. 0 369 72

The 0 369 73
courts 0 369 73
and 0 369 73
especially 0 369 73
the 0 369 73
Supreme 0 369 73
Court 0 369 73
have 0 369 73
been 0 369 73
critical 0 369 73
to 0 369 73
the 0 369 73
progressives’ 0 369 73
program 0 369 73
since 0 369 73
Woodrow 0 369 73
Wilson. 0 369 73

The 0 369 74
biggest 0 369 74
obstacle 0 369 74
to 0 369 74
the 0 369 74
progressive 0 369 74
dream 0 369 74
of 0 369 74
government 0 369 74
controlled 0 369 74
and 0 369 74
managed 0 369 74
by 0 369 74
a 0 369 74
technocratic 0 369 74
oligarchy 0 369 74
has 0 369 74
been 0 369 74
the 0 369 74
Constitution. 0 369 74

Its 0 369 75
divided 0 369 75
and 0 369 75
balanced 0 369 75
powers 0 369 75
were 0 369 75
designed 0 369 75
precisely 0 369 75
to 0 369 75
rein 0 369 75
in 0 369 75
overreaching 0 369 75
ambition 0 369 75
and 0 369 75
concentrations 0 369 75
of 0 369 75
power. 0 369 75

Hence 0 369 76
the 0 369 76
Constitutional 0 369 76
order 0 369 76
must 0 369 76
be 0 369 76
subverted 0 369 76
by 0 369 76
the 0 369 76
Supreme 0 369 76
Court 0 369 76
and 0 369 76
its 0 369 76
unaccountable 0 369 76
justices 0 369 76
enjoying 0 369 76
lifelong 0 369 76
tenure. 0 369 76

But 0 369 77
if 0 369 77
Kavanaugh 0 369 77
is 0 369 77
confirmed, 0 369 77
there 0 369 77
will 0 369 77
be 0 369 77
five 0 369 77
reliably 0 369 77
Constitutionalist 0 369 77
justices 0 369 77
on 0 369 77
the 0 369 77
bench, 0 369 77
who 0 369 77
are 0 369 77
unlikely 0 369 77
to 0 369 77
tolerate 0 369 77
judicial 0 369 77
usurpation 0 369 77
of 0 369 77
Congress’s 0 369 77
law-making 0 369 77
powers. 0 369 77

That’s 0 369 78
why 0 369 78
this 0 369 78
current 0 369 78
nomination 0 369 78
is 0 369 78
a 0 369 78
hill 0 369 78
the 1 369 78
Dems 1 369 78
are 0 369 78
willing 0 369 78
to 1 369 78
beclown 1 369 78
themselves 1 369 78
on. 1 369 78

Given 0 369 79
how 0 369 79
obviously 1 369 79
partisan 1 369 79
and 1 369 79
hypocritical 1 369 79
this 0 369 79
ploy 0 369 79
is––doesn’t 0 369 79
Keith 0 369 79
Ellison’s 0 369 79
accuser 0 369 79
deserve 0 369 79
to 0 369 79
be 0 369 79
heard 0 369 79
and 0 369 79
believed 0 369 79
too? 0 369 79

––why 1 369 80
has 1 369 80
Grassley 1 369 80
so 1 369 80
far 1 369 80
allowed 1 369 80
himself 1 369 80
to 1 369 80
be 1 369 80
played 1 369 80
by 1 369 80
the 1 369 80
Dems? 1 369 80

Because 0 369 81
Republicans 0 369 81
fear 0 369 81
the 0 369 81
backlash 0 369 81
from 0 369 81
all 0 369 81
those 0 369 81
women 0 369 81
voters 0 369 81
who 0 369 81
presumably 0 369 81
agree 0 369 81
with 0 369 81
the 0 369 81
fundamentalist 0 369 81
feminists, 0 369 81
and 0 369 81
insist 0 369 81
that 0 369 81
every 1 369 81
accusation 1 369 81
of 1 369 81
sexual 1 369 81
assault, 1 369 81
no 1 369 81
matter 1 369 81
how 1 369 81
much 1 369 81
it’s 1 369 81
unsupported 1 369 81
by 1 369 81
corroborating 1 369 81
evidence 1 369 81
or 1 369 81
even 1 369 81
plausibility, 1 369 81
must 1 369 81
be 1 369 81
believed. 1 369 81

This 0 369 82
contention 0 369 82
itself 0 369 82
is 0 369 82
an 0 369 82
expression 0 369 82
of 0 369 82
the 0 369 82
radical 0 369 82
feminist 0 369 82
narrative 0 369 82
of 0 369 82
innate 0 369 82
male 0 369 82
feral 1 369 82
sexuality 1 369 82
that 0 369 82
makes 0 369 82
them 0 369 82
sexual 1 369 82
predators. 1 369 82

The 0 369 83
irony 0 369 83
is 0 369 83
that 0 369 83
today’s 0 369 83
feminists 0 369 83
have 0 369 83
been 0 369 83
willing 0 369 83
to 0 369 83
sacrifice 0 369 83
the 0 369 83
earlier 0 369 83
narrative 0 369 83
of 0 369 83
female 0 369 83
power 0 369 83
and 0 369 83
agency 0 369 83
that 0 369 83
had 0 369 83
been 0 369 83
stifled 0 369 83
by 0 369 83
traditional 0 369 83
views 0 369 83
of 0 369 83
the 0 369 83
sexes 0 369 83
and 0 369 83
their 0 369 83
capabilities. 0 369 83

Instead, 0 369 84
now 0 369 84
women 0 369 84
are 0 369 84
Victorian 1 369 84
hothouse 1 369 84
flowers 1 369 84
too 0 369 84
delicate 0 369 84
to 0 369 84
make 0 369 84
their 0 369 84
way 0 369 84
through 0 369 84
their 0 369 84
lives 0 369 84
without 0 369 84
the 0 369 84
paternal 0 369 84
federal 0 369 84
government 0 369 84
protecting 0 369 84
them 0 369 84
with 0 369 84
its 0 369 84
coercive 0 369 84
power. 0 369 84

Women 0 369 85
have 0 369 85
exchanged 0 369 85
one 0 369 85
form 0 369 85
of 0 369 85
dependence, 0 369 85
and 0 369 85
one 0 369 85
double 0 369 85
standard 0 369 85
for 0 369 85
another. 0 369 85

The 1 369 86
Dems 1 369 86
are 0 369 86
using 0 369 86
Ford 0 369 86
and 0 369 86
Ramirez 0 369 86
as 0 369 86
part 0 369 86
of 0 369 86
the 0 369 86
Democrats’ 0 369 86
transparently 0 369 86
dishonest 0 369 86
delaying 0 369 86
tactics 0 369 86
because 0 369 86
they 0 369 86
know 0 369 86
that 0 369 86
most 0 369 86
Republicans 0 369 86
have 0 369 86
accepted 0 369 86
this 0 369 86
duplicitous 0 369 86
feminist 0 369 86
narrative 0 369 86
and 0 369 86
fear 0 369 86
challenging 0 369 86
it. 0 369 86

Especially 0 369 87
after 0 369 87
the 0 369 87
recent 0 369 87
spate 0 369 87
of 0 369 87
sexual 0 369 87
assault 0 369 87
charges––many 0 369 87
of 0 369 87
them 0 369 87
true, 0 369 87
some 0 369 87
false, 0 369 87
others 0 369 87
contested–– 0 369 87
politicians 0 369 87
consider 0 369 87
bucking 0 369 87
the 0 369 87
narrative 0 369 87
to 0 369 87
be 0 369 87
as 0 369 87
politically 1 369 87
suicidal 1 369 87
as 0 369 87
proposing 0 369 87
to 0 369 87
reform 0 369 87
Social 0 369 87
Security 0 369 87
and 0 369 87
Medicare. 0 369 87

It’s 0 369 88
the 0 369 88
new 0 369 88
third 0 369 88
rail 0 369 88
of 0 369 88
American 0 369 88
politics, 0 369 88
one 0 369 88
that 0 369 88
transcends 0 369 88
party 0 369 88
affiliation. 0 369 88

Hence 0 369 89
the 0 369 89
widespread 0 369 89
virtue-signaling 0 369 89
on 0 369 89
the 0 369 89
part 0 369 89
even 0 369 89
of 0 369 89
conservative 0 369 89
writers 0 369 89
who 0 369 89
preface 0 369 89
their 0 369 89
comments 0 369 89
about 0 369 89
Ford 0 369 89
and 0 369 89
Ramirez 0 369 89
with 0 369 89
prologues 0 369 89
full 0 369 89
of 0 369 89
truisms 0 369 89
about 0 369 89
how 0 369 89
horrible 0 369 89
sexual 0 369 89
assault 0 369 89
is, 0 369 89
how 0 369 89
its 0 369 89
self-proclaimed 0 369 89
victims 0 369 89
“must 0 369 89
be 0 369 89
heard,” 0 369 89
and 0 369 89
how 0 369 89
churlish 0 369 89
and 0 369 89
sexist 0 369 89
it 0 369 89
is 0 369 89
to 0 369 89
question 0 369 89
the 0 369 89
truth 0 369 89
of 0 369 89
any 0 369 89
charge. 0 369 89

Grown-ups 0 369 90
know 0 369 90
all 0 369 90
that 0 369 90
and 0 369 90
don’t 0 369 90
have 0 369 90
to 0 369 90
be 0 369 90
reminded 0 369 90
every 0 369 90
time 0 369 90
the 0 369 90
subject 0 369 90
arises. 0 369 90

The 1 369 91
Dems 1 369 91
know 0 369 91
that 0 369 91
most 0 369 91
Republicans 0 369 91
come 0 369 91
to 0 369 91
this 0 369 91
conflict 0 369 91
with 0 369 91
the 0 369 91
huge 0 369 91
disadvantage 0 369 91
that 0 369 91
results 0 369 91
from 0 369 91
accepting 0 369 91
your 0 369 91
opponent’s 0 369 91
dubious 1 369 91
ideology 1 369 91
and 1 369 91
dishonest 1 369 91
narrative. 1 369 91

The 0 369 92
progressive 0 369 92
party 0 369 92
can 0 369 92
dare 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
Republicans 0 369 92
to 0 369 92
ignore 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
endless 0 369 92
specious 0 369 92
demands, 0 369 92
stop 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
show-trial, 0 369 92
and 0 369 92
proceed 0 369 92
to 0 369 92
a 0 369 92
vote 0 369 92
on 0 369 92
Kavanaugh, 0 369 92
because 0 369 92
they 0 369 92
know 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
Republicans, 0 369 92
fearful 0 369 92
of 0 369 92
the 0 369 92
“optics,” 0 369 92
will 0 369 92
cave. 0 369 92

They 0 369 93
know 0 369 93
that 0 369 93
the 0 369 93
eleven 0 369 93
male 0 369 93
Republican 0 369 93
Senators 0 369 93
on 0 369 93
the 0 369 93
Judiciary 0 369 93
Committee 0 369 93
dread 0 369 93
the 0 369 93
#MeToo 0 369 93
movement 0 369 93
casting 0 369 93
them 0 369 93
as 0 369 93
knuckle-dragging 1 369 93
Neanderthal 1 369 93
sexists 1 369 93
who 0 369 93
want 0 369 93
to 0 369 93
“silence” 0 369 93
the 0 369 93
accuser 0 369 93
with 0 369 93
their 0 369 93
“cavalier 1 369 93
treatment 1 369 93
of 0 369 93
a 0 369 93

survivor,” 0 369 93
as 0 369 93
one 0 369 93
Ford 0 369 93
lawyer 0 369 93
has 0 369 93
said. 0 369 93

Republicans 0 369 94
still 0 369 94
don’t 0 369 94
get 0 369 94
that 0 369 94
no 0 369 94
amount 0 369 94
of 0 369 94
appeasement 0 369 94
will 0 369 94
stop 0 369 94
the 0 369 94
left 0 369 94
from 0 369 94
demonizing 1 369 94
them 1 369 94
anyway. 0 369 94

Just 0 369 95
ask 0 369 95
Boy 0 369 95
Scout 0 369 95
Mitt 0 369 95
Romney, 0 369 95
who 1 369 95
was 1 369 95
savaged 1 369 95
for 0 369 95
his 0 369 95
innocuous 0 369 95
“binders 0 369 95
full 0 369 95
of 0 369 95
women.” 0 369 95

And 0 369 96
don’t 0 369 96
forget, 0 369 96
the 0 369 96
old 0 369 96
sorta, 0 369 96
kinda 0 369 96
moderate 0 369 96
Democrats 0 369 96
like 0 369 96
Feinstein 0 369 96
and 0 369 96
Chuck 0 369 96
Schumer, 0 369 96
who 0 369 96
now 0 369 96
have 0 369 96
joined 0 369 96
the 0 369 96
crowd 0 369 96
of 0 369 96
trendoid 1 369 96
socialists 1 369 96
armed 1 369 96
with 1 369 96
torches 1 369 96
and 1 369 96
pitch-forks, 1 369 96
will 0 369 96
go 0 369 96
along 0 369 96
because 0 369 96
they’re 0 369 96
frightened 0 369 96
of 0 369 96
their 0 369 96
party’s 0 369 96
increasingly 1 369 96
rabid 1 369 96
left-wing 1 369 96
base. 1 369 96

What 0 369 97
can 0 369 97
we 0 369 97
do 0 369 97
to 0 369 97
end 0 369 97
these 0 369 97
confirmation 1 369 97
circuses? 1 369 97

Just 0 369 98
stop 0 369 98
holding 0 369 98
them. 0 369 98

There’s 0 369 99
nothing 0 369 99
in 0 369 99
the 0 369 99
Constitution 0 369 99
that 0 369 99
says 0 369 99
the 0 369 99

to 0 369 99
give 0 369 99

the 0 369 99
president 0 369 99
regarding 0 369 99
his 0 369 99

grandstanding 1 369 99

who’ve 0 369 99
already 0 369 99

their 0 369 99

Invite 0 369 100

the 0 369 100

to 0 369 100

Don’t 0 369 101
put 0 369 101
it 0 369 101
on 0 369 101
television, 0 369 101
but 0 369 101
make 0 369 101
public 0 369 101
a 0 369 101

Remove 0 369 102
the 0 369 102

and 0 369 102
attention-craving, 1 369 102
politically 1 369 102
ambitious 1 369 102
Senators 1 369 102

For 0 369 103
now, 0 369 103
Grassley 0 369 103
needs 0 369 103
to 0 369 103
end 0 369 103
this 0 369 103
farce 1 369 103
if 0 369 103

the 0 369 110

already 0 379 18

of 0 379 18
hers 0 379 18
at 0 379 18

Two 0 379 19
of 0 379 19
those 0 379 19
named 0 379 19
have 0 379 19
stated 0 379 19
that 0 379 19
they 0 379 19
will 0 379 19
cooperate 0 379 19
with 0 379 19

“I 0 379 20

Kavanaugh 0 379 20
friend 0 379 20
Mark 0 379 20

said. 0 379 20

“My 0 379 21

fully 0 379 21
with 0 379 21
this 0 379 21

investigation,” 0 379 21
said 0 379 21
attorney 0 379 21
Eric 0 379 21
B. 0 379 21
Bruce. 0 379 21

Kavanaugh 0 379 22
also 0 379 22
said 0 379 22
he 0 379 22
would 0 379 22
be 0 379 22
cooperating 0 379 22
as 0 379 22
he 0 379 22
has 0 379 22
in 0 379 22
the 0 379 22
past. 0 379 22

“Throughout 0 379 23
this 0 379 23
process, 0 379 23
I’ve 0 379 23
been 0 379 23
interviewed 0 379 23
by 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
FBI, 0 379 23
I’ve 0 379 23
done 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
number 0 379 23
of 0 379 23
‘background’ 0 379 23
calls 0 379 23
directly 0 379 23
with 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Senate, 0 379 23
and 0 379 23
yesterday, 0 379 23
I 0 379 23
answered 0 379 23
questions 0 379 23
under 0 379 23
oath 0 379 23
about 0 379 23
every 0 379 23
topic 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
Senators 0 379 23
and 0 379 23
their 0 379 23
counsel 0 379 23
asked 0 379 23
me," 0 379 23
Kavanaugh 0 379 23
said 0 379 23
in 0 379 23
a 0 379 23
statement 0 379 23
that 0 379 23
was 0 379 23
released 0 379 23
by 0 379 23
the 0 379 23
White 0 379 23
House. 0 379 23

"I’ve 0 379 24
done 0 379 24
everything 0 379 24
they 0 379 24
have 0 379 24
requested 0 379 24
and 0 379 24
will 0 379 24
continue 0 379 24
to 0 379 24
cooperate." 0 379 24

Well, 0 379 25
Senator 0 379 25
Flake 0 379 25
has 0 379 25
given 0 379 25
the 0 379 25
Democrats 0 379 25
what 0 379 25
they 0 379 25
wanted 0 379 25
and 0 379 25
you 0 379 25
can 0 379 25
bet 0 379 25
that 0 379 25
they 0 379 25
are 0 379 25
still 0 379 25
going 0 379 25
to 0 379 25
vote 0 379 25
pretty 0 379 25
much 0 379 25
on 0 379 25
party 0 379 25
lines 0 379 25
concerning 0 379 25
Kavanaugh. 0 379 25

Now, 0 379 26
President 0 379 26
Trump 0 379 26
has 0 379 26
gone 0 379 26
along 0 379 26
with 0 379 26
it. 0 379 26

My 0 379 27
guess 0 379 27
is 0 379 27
that 0 379 27
one 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
two 0 379 27
things 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
occur 0 379 27
with 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
FBI 0 379 27
investigation: 0 379 27
(1) 0 379 27
Absolutely 1 379 27
nothing 1 379 27
will 1 379 27
be 1 379 27
found, 1 379 27
and 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
have 0 379 27
been 0 379 27
a 0 379 27
huge 1 379 27
waste 1 379 27
of 1 379 27
time 1 379 27
or 0 379 27
(2) 0 379 27
look 0 379 27
for 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
thing 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
expand 0 379 27
and 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
need 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
arise 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
make 0 379 27
this 0 379 27
more 1 379 27
of 1 379 27
a 1 379 27
circus 1 379 27
than 1 379 27
it 1 379 27
already 1 379 27
is, 1 379 27
which 0 379 27
will 0 379 27
dwarf 0 379 27
anything 0 379 27
Clarence 0 379 27
Thomas 0 379 27
had 0 379 27
to 0 379 27
face 0 379 27
from 0 379 27
the 0 379 27
slanderous 1 379 27
accusations 0 379 27
of 0 379 27
Anita 0 379 27
Hill. 0 379 27

Remember, 0 379 27

whether 0 379 27

you 0 379 27

like 0 379 27

Judge 0 379 27

Kavanaugh 0 379 27

or 0 379 27

not, 0 379 27

this 0 379 27

has 0 379 27

been 0 379 27

nothing 0 379 27

a 0 379 27

Secretary 0 83 1
of 0 83 1
State 0 83 1
Michael 0 83 1
R. 0 83 1
Pompeo 0 83 1
expressed 0 83 1
confidence 0 83 1
Wednesday 0 83 1
that 0 83 1
the 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
government 0 83 1
could 0 83 1
be 0 83 1
trusted 0 83 1
to 0 83 1
investigate 0 83 1
the 0 83 1
disappearance 0 83 1
and 0 83 1
suspected 0 83 1
murder 0 83 1
of 0 83 1
a 0 83 1
U.S.-based 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
journalist 0 83 1
in 0 83 1
a 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
diplomatic 0 83 1
facility 0 83 1
in 0 83 1
Turkey 0 83 1
— 0 83 1
despite 0 83 1
the 0 83 1
likelihood 0 83 1
that 0 83 1
senior 0 83 1
Saudi 0 83 1
officials 0 83 1
were 0 83 1
involved. 0 83 1

Speaking 0 83 2
in 0 83 2
Ankara, 0 83 2
Turkey, 0 83 2
Pompeo 0 83 2
offered 0 83 2
that 0 83 2
support 0 83 2
hours 0 83 2
after 0 83 2
President 0 83 2
Donald 0 83 2
Trump 0 83 2
had 0 83 2
mounted 0 83 2
an 0 83 2
even 0 83 2
stronger 0 83 2
defense 0 83 2
for 0 83 2
the 0 83 2
Saudi 0 83 2
rulers, 0 83 2
saying, 0 83 2
“Here 0 83 2
we 0 83 2
go 0 83 2
again 0 83 2
with 0 83 2
you’re 0 83 2
guilty 0 83 2
until 0 83 2
proven 0 83 2
innocent.” 0 83 2

Together 0 83 3
they 0 83 3
appeared 0 83 3
to 0 83 3
signal 0 83 3
a 0 83 3
shift 0 83 3
in 0 83 3
White 0 83 3
House 0 83 3
strategy 0 83 3
— 0 83 3
earlier 0 83 3
this 0 83 3
week 0 83 3
Trump 0 83 3
had 0 83 3
warned 0 83 3
Saudi 0 83 3
rulers 0 83 3
could 0 83 3
face 0 83 3
“severe 1 83 3
punishment” 0 83 3
— 0 83 3
and 0 83 3
suggested 0 83 3
the 0 83 3
administration 0 83 3
has 0 83 3
decided 0 83 3
to 0 83 3
help 0 83 3
its 0 83 3
most 0 83 3
important 0 83 3
ally 0 83 3

over 0 83 3
the 0 83 3
fate 0 83 3
of 0 83 3

The 0 83 4
dissident 0 83 4
journalist, 0 83 4
who 0 83 4
lived 0 83 4
in 0 83 4
Virginia, 0 83 4
vanished 0 83 4
Oct. 0 83 4
2 0 83 4

the 0 83 4
Saudi 0 83 4
Consulate 0 83 4
in 0 83 4
Istanbul, 0 83 4

Neither 0 83 5

nor 0 83 5
his 0 83 5
top 0 83 5

of 0 83 6
his 0 83 6

that 0 83 11

On 0 83 12
his 0 83 12
flight 0 83 12
from 0 83 12
Riyadh 0 83 12
to 0 83 12
Ankara, 0 83 12
Pompeo 1 83 12
reiterated 1 83 12
his 1 83 12
confidence 1 83 12
that 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
Saudi 1 83 12
government 1 83 12
would 1 83 12
conduct 1 83 12
a 1 83 12
“thorough, 1 83 12
complete, 1 83 12
and 1 83 12
transparent 1 83 12
investigation,” 1 83 12
adding 1 83 12
that 1 83 12
they 1 83 12
will 1 83 12
“show 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
entire 1 83 12
world” 1 83 12
the 1 83 12
results. 1 83 12

He 0 83 13
said 0 83 13
Saudi 0 83 13
leaders 0 83 13
made 0 83 13
a 0 83 13
commitment 0 83 13
“to 0 83 13
hold 0 83 13
anyone 0 83 13
connected 0 83 13

any 0 83 13

that 0 83 13
may 0 83 13
be 0 83 13
found 0 83 13
accountable 0 83 13
for 0 83 13
that, 0 83 13
whether 0 83 13
they 0 83 13
are 0 83 13
a 0 83 13
senior 0 83 13
officer 0 83 13
or 0 83 13
official.” 0 83 13
He 0 83 13
said 0 83 13
they 0 83 13
made 0 83 13
“no 0 83 13
exceptions,” 0 83 13
including 0 83 13
presumably 0 83 13
members 0 83 13
of 0 83 13
the 0 83 13
royal 0 83 13
family. 0 83 13

Asked 0 83 14
if 0 83 14
the 0 83 14
Saudis 0 83 14
had 0 83 14
informed 0 83 14
him 0 83 14
whether 0 83 14
Khashoggi 0 83 14
was 0 83 14
alive 0 83 14
or 0 83 14
dead, 0 83 14
Pompeo 0 83 14
said, 0 83 14
“I 0 83 14
don’t 0 83 14
want 0 83 14
to 0 83 14
talk 0 83 14
about 0 83 14
any 0 83 14
of 0 83 14
the 0 83 14
facts. 0 83 14

They 0 83 15
didn’t 0 83 15
want 0 83 15
to 0 83 15
either, 0 83 15
in 0 83 15
that 0 83 15
they 0 83 15
want 0 83 15
to 0 83 15
have 0 83 15
the 0 83 15
opportunity 0 83 15
to 0 83 15

this 0 83 15
investigation 0 83 15
in 0 83 15
a 0 83 15
thorough 0 83 15
way.” 0 83 15

Asked 0 83 16
if 0 83 16
he 0 83 16
believed 0 83 16
the 0 83 16
Saudi 0 83 16
rulers’ 0 83 16
repeated 0 83 16
denial 0 83 16
of 0 83 16
complicity, 0 83 16
Pompeo 0 83 16
said 0 83 16
he 0 83 16
was 0 83 16
reserving 0 83 16
judgment. 0 83 16

“I 0 83 17
think 0 83 17
that’s 0 83 17
— 0 83 17
I 0 83 17
think 0 83 17
that’s 0 83 17
— 0 83 17
I 0 83 17
think 0 83 17
that’s 0 83 17
a 0 83 17
reasonable 0 83 17
thing 0 83 17
to 0 83 17
do, 0 83 17
to 0 83 17
give 0 83 17
them 0 83 17
that 0 83 17
opportunity,” 0 83 17
Pompeo 0 83 17
said, 0 83 17
“(and 0 83 17
then) 0 83 17
we’ll 0 83 17
all 0 83 17
get 0 83 17
to 0 83 17
evaluate 0 83 17
the 0 83 17
work 0 83 17
that 0 83 17
they 0 83 17
do.” 0 83 17

Pompeo 0 83 18
refused 0 83 18
to 0 83 18
discuss 0 83 18
possible 0 83 18
consequences 0 83 18
for 0 83 18
those 0 83 18
found 0 83 18
responsible 0 83 18
for 0 83 18
Khashoggi’s 0 83 18
disappearance, 0 83 18
reiterating 0 83 18
at 0 83 18
least 0 83 18
three 0 83 18
times 0 83 18
the 0 83 18
“importance 0 83 18
of 0 83 18
the 0 83 18
investigation.” 0 83 18

Later 0 83 19
Wednesday, 0 83 19
Pompeo 0 83 19
said 0 83 19
during 0 83 19
a 0 83 19
refueling 0 83 19
stopover 0 83 19
in 0 83 19
Brussels 0 83 19
that 0 83 19
Erdogan 0 83 19
had 0 83 19
informed 0 83 19
him 0 83 19
the 0 83 19
Saudis 0 83 19
were 0 83 19
cooperating 0 83 19
with 0 83 19
the 0 83 19
Turkish 0 83 19
investigation 0 83 19
“after 0 83 19
a 0 83 19
couple 0 83 19
of 0 83 19
delays.” 0 83 19

Turkish 0 83 20
officials 0 83 20
“seemed 0 83 20
pretty 0 83 20
confident 0 83 20
the 0 83 20

them 0 83 20

complete” 0 83 20
the 0 83 20
investigation, 0 83 20
Pompeo 0 83 20
told 0 83 20

with 0 83 20
him. 0 83 20

looking 0 83 21
to 0 83 21

get 0 83 21
out 0 83 21
of 0 83 21
its 0 83 21
dilemma, 0 83 21
Pompeo 0 83 21
urged 0 83 21
Americans 0 83 21
to 0 83 21
be 0 83 21
mindful 0 83 21
of 0 83 21
the 0 83 21
extensive 0 83 21
energy, 0 83 21

ties 0 83 21
between 0 83 21

Washington, 0 83 21
including 0 83 21
efforts 0 83 21
against 0 83 21
what 0 83 21
he 0 83 21
called 0 83 21
the 0 83 21
world’s 0 83 21
largest 0 83 21
supporter 0 83 21
of 0 83 21
terrorism, 0 83 21
Iran. 0 83 21

“The 0 83 22
Saudis 0 83 22
have 0 83 22
been 0 83 22
great 1 83 22
partners 1 83 22
in 0 83 22
working 0 83 22
alongside 0 83 22
us 0 83 22
on 0 83 22
these 0 83 22
issues,” 0 83 22
Pompeo 0 83 22
said. 0 83 22

“We 0 83 23
need 0 83 23
to 0 83 23
make 0 83 23
sure 0 83 23
we 0 83 23
are 0 83 23
mindful 0 83 23
of 0 83 23
that 0 83 23
as 0 83 23
we 0 83 23
approach 0 83 23
decisions” 0 83 23
on 0 83 23
whether 0 83 23
to 0 83 23
impose 0 83 23

other 0 83 23
punitive 0 83 23
steps 0 83 23
against 0 83 23
Riyadh, 0 83 23
as 0 83 23
many 0 83 23
in 0 83 23
Congress 0 83 23
and 0 83 23
elsewhere 0 83 23
have 0 83 23
urged. 0 83 23

Critics 0 83 24
questioned 0 83 24
whether 0 83 24
the 0 83 24
Saudi 0 83 24
rulers, 0 83 24
who 0 83 24
preside 0 83 24
over 0 83 24
an 0 83 24
authoritarian 0 83 24
regime 0 83 24
that 0 83 24
allows 0 83 24
little 0 83 24
opposition, 0 83 24
can 0 83 24
be 0 83 24
relied 0 83 24
on 0 83 24
to 0 83 24
conduct 0 83 24
a 0 83 24
credible 0 83 24
probe 0 83 24
into 0 83 24
Khashoggi’s 0 83 24
fate 0 83 24
— 0 83 24
especially 0 83 24
without 0 83 24
decisive 0 83 24
pressure 0 83 24
from 0 83 24
their 0 83 24
close 0 83 24
ally, 0 83 24
the 0 83 24
Trump 0 83 24
administration. 0 83 24

Saudi 0 83 25
leaders 0 83 25
for 0 83 25
two 0 83 25
weeks 0 83 25
denied 0 83 25
knowing 0 83 25
anything 0 83 25
about 0 83 25
the 0 83 25
Khashoggi 0 83 25
case. 0 83 25

On 0 83 26
Monday, 0 83 26
they 0 83 26
began 0 83 26
floating 0 83 26
a 0 83 26
scenario 0 83 26
— 0 83 26
initially 0 83 26
adopted 0 83 26
by 0 83 26
Trump 0 83 26
— 0 83 26
that 0 83 26
blamed 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
murder 0 83 26
inside 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
consulate 0 83 26
on 0 83 26
“rogue 0 83 26
killers,” 0 83 26
and 0 83 26
then 0 83 26
suggested 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
writer 0 83 26
was 0 83 26
accidentally 0 83 26
killed 0 83 26
during 0 83 26
an 0 83 26
interrogation 0 83 26
that 0 83 26
went 0 83 26
awry. 0 83 26

Analysts 0 83 27
familiar 0 83 27
with 0 83 27
the 0 83 27
desert 0 83 27
kingdom 0 83 27
said 0 83 27
it 0 83 27
was 0 83 27
likely 0 83 27
Saudi 0 83 27
leaders 0 83 27
were 0 83 27
hoping 0 83 27
the 0 83 27
scandal 0 83 27
would 0 83 27
blow 0 83 27
over 0 83 27
and 0 83 27
that 0 83 27
they 0 83 27
could 0 83 27
wait 0 83 27
it 0 83 27
out. 0 83 27

“We 0 83 28
received 0 83 28
commitments 0 83 28
that 0 83 28
they 0 83 28
would 0 83 28
complete 0 83 28
this 0 83 28
(investigation), 0 83 28
and 0 83 28
I 0 83 28
am 0 83 28
counting 0 83 28
on 0 83 28
them 0 83 28
to 0 83 28
do 0 83 28
that,” 0 83 28
Pompeo 0 83 28
said. 0 83 28

“They 0 83 29
gave 0 83 29
me 0 83 29
their 0 83 29
word.” 0 83 29

“I 0 411 17
absolutely, 1 411 17

"I’ve 0 411 18
said 0 411 18
that 0 411 18
many, 0 411 18
many 0 411 18
years 0 411 18

“Look, 0 411 19
in 0 411 19
the 0 411 19
early 0 411 19
1990s, 0 411 19
Louis 0 411 19
Farrakhan 0 411 19
was 0 411 19
a 0 411 19

Ellison 0 411 19
added. 0 411 19

"At 0 411 20
that 0 411 20
time, 0 411 20
he 0 411 20

"He 0 411 21
made 0 411 21
it 0 411 21
very 0 411 21
clear 0 411 21
in 0 411 21
the 0 411 21

that 0 411 21

Keith, 0 411 22
you're 0 411 22
lying. 0 411 22

It's 0 411 23
clear 0 411 23
from 0 411 23
video 0 411 23
evidence 0 411 23
that 0 411 23

and 0 411 23
fellow 0 411 23

Take 0 411 24
a 0 411 24
look 0 411 24
for 0 411 24
yourself 0 411 24
and 0 411 24
understand 0 411 24
how 0 411 24
pathological 0 411 24
liar 0 411 24
and 0 411 24
accused 0 411 24

Keith 0 411 24
Ellison 0 411 24
seeks 0 411 24
to 0 411 24
deceive 0 411 24
you. 0 411 24

In 0 411 25
case 0 411 25
you 0 411 25
missed 0 411 25
it, 0 411 25
here's 1 411 25
a 1 411 25
still 1 411 25
frame 1 411 25
of 1 411 25
Ellison 1 411 25
just 1 411 25
a 1 411 25
few 1 411 25
feet 1 411 25
away 1 411 25
from 1 411 25
a 1 411 25
man 1 411 25
who 1 411 25
has 1 411 25
called 1 411 25
on 1 411 25
10,000 1 411 25
blacks 1 411 25
to 1 411 25
stalk 1 411 25
and 1 411 25
murder 1 411 25
white 1 411 25
people. 1 411 25

Both 0 411 26
of 0 411 26
these 0 411 26
men 0 411 26
have 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
same 0 411 26
devil 0 411 26
as 0 411 26
their 0 411 26
father 0 411 26
because 0 411 26
both 0 411 26
men 0 411 26
are 0 411 26
following 0 411 26
after 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
teaching 0 411 26
of 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
Koran 0 411 26
. 0 411 26

One 0 411 27
of 0 411 27
them 0 411 27
just 0 411 27
actually 0 411 27
has 0 411 27
the 0 411 27
nerve 0 411 27
to 0 411 27
say 0 411 27
it. 0 411 27

The 0 411 28
other 0 411 28
doesn't. 0 411 28

Maybe 0 411 29
Ellison 0 411 29
is 0 411 29
attempting 0 411 29
to 1 411 29
pull 1 411 29
an 1 411 29
Obama. 1 411 29

Remember 0 411 30
when 0 411 30
Obama's 0 411 30
"pastor," 0 411 30
Jeremiah 0 411 30
Wright 0 411 30
uttered 0 411 30
"God 0 411 30
damn, 0 411 30
America!"? 0 411 30

Obama 0 411 31
tried 0 411 31
to 0 411 31
say 0 411 31
he 0 411 31
had 0 411 31
been 0 411 31
in 0 411 31
that 0 411 31
church 0 411 31
for 0 411 31
years 0 411 31
and 0 411 31
never 0 411 31
heard 0 411 31
such 0 411 31
things, 0 411 31
which 0 411 31
isn't 0 411 31
true. 0 411 31

Ellison 1 411 32
is 1 411 32
attempting 1 411 32
to 1 411 32
do 1 411 32
that 1 411 32

feature 0 414 14
in 0 414 14
the 0 414 14

every 0 414 14

There 0 414 15
were 0 414 15
no 0 414 15

For 0 414 16
an 0 414 16

to 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
made 0 414 16

Manafort 0 414 16

the 1 414 16
“Russians” 1 414 16
would 0 414 16
have 0 414 16
had 0 414 16
to 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
a 0 414 16
decision 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
Government 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
Ecuador, 0 414 16
not 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
Wikileaks, 0 414 16
and 0 414 16
that 0 414 16
would 0 414 16
be 0 414 16
so 0 414 16
exceptional 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
reason 0 414 16
for 0 414 16
it 0 414 16
would 0 414 16
surely 0 414 16
have 0 414 16
been 0 414 16
noted 0 414 16
in 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
now 0 414 16
leaked 0 414 16
supposed 0 414 16
Ecuadorean 0 414 16
“intelligence 0 414 16
report” 0 414 16
of 0 414 16
the 0 414 16
visits. 0 414 16

What 0 414 17
possible 0 414 17
motive 0 414 17
would 0 414 17
the 0 414 17
Ecuadorean 0 414 17
government 0 414 17
have 0 414 17
for 0 414 17
facilitating 0 414 17

unrecorded 0 414 17
visits 0 414 17
by 0 414 17
Paul 0 414 17
Manafort? 0 414 17

Furthermore 0 414 18
it 0 414 18
is 0 414 18
impossible 0 414 18
that 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
intelligence 0 414 18
agency 0 414 18
– 0 414 18
who 0 414 18
were 0 414 18
in 0 414 18
charge 0 414 18
of 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
security 0 414 18
– 0 414 18
would 0 414 18
not 0 414 18
know 0 414 18
the 0 414 18
identity 0 414 18
of 0 414 18
these 0 414 18
alleged 0 414 18
“Russians”. 1 414 18

Previously 1 414 19
Harding 1 414 19
and 1 414 19
the 1 414 19
Guardian 1 414 19
have 1 414 19
published 1 414 19
documents 1 414 19
faked 1 414 19
by 1 414 19
the 1 414 19
Moreno 1 414 19
government 1 414 19
regarding 1 414 19
a 1 414 19
diplomatic 1 414 19
appointment 1 414 19
to 1 414 19
Russia 1 414 19
for 1 414 19
Assange 1 414 19
of 1 414 19
which 1 414 19
he 1 414 19
had 1 414 19
no 1 414 19
knowledge. 1 414 19

Now 1 414 20
they 1 414 20
follow 1 414 20
this 1 414 20
up 1 414 20
with 1 414 20
more 1 414 20
documents 1 414 20
aimed 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
provide 1 414 20
fictitious 1 414 20
evidence 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
bolster 1 414 20
Mueller’s 1 414 20
pathetically 1 414 20
failed 1 414 20
attempt 1 414 20
to 1 414 20
substantiate 1 414 20
the 1 414 20
story 1 414 20
that 1 414 20
Russia 1 414 20
deprived 1 414 20
Hillary 1 414 20
of 1 414 20
the 1 414 20

My 0 414 21
friend 0 414 21
William 0 414 21
Binney, 0 414 21
probably 1 414 21
the 1 414 21
world’s 1 414 21
greatest 1 414 21
expert 1 414 21
on 1 414 21
electronic 1 414 21
surveillance, 1 414 21
former 0 414 21
Technical 0 414 21
Director 0 414 21
of 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
NSA, 0 414 21
has 0 414 21
stated 0 414 21
that 0 414 21
it 0 414 21
is 0 414 21
impossible 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
DNC 0 414 21
servers 0 414 21
were 0 414 21
hacked, 0 414 21
the 0 414 21
technical 0 414 21
evidence 0 414 21
shows 0 414 21
it 0 414 21
was 0 414 21
a 0 414 21
download 0 414 21
to 0 414 21
a 0 414 21
directly 0 414 21
connected 0 414 21
memory 0 414 21
stick. 0 414 21

I 1 414 22
knew 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
US 1 414 22
security 1 414 22
services 1 414 22
were 1 414 22
conducting 1 414 22
a 1 414 22
fake 1 414 22
investigation 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
moment 1 414 22
it 1 414 22
became 1 414 22
clear 1 414 22
that 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
FBI 1 414 22
did 1 414 22
not 1 414 22
even 1 414 22
themselves 1 414 22
look 1 414 22
at 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
DNC 1 414 22
servers, 1 414 22
instead 1 414 22
accepting 1 414 22
a 1 414 22
report 1 414 22
from 1 414 22
the 1 414 22
Clinton 1 414 22
linked 1 414 22
DNC 1 414 22
“security 1 414 22
consultants” 1 414 22
Crowdstrike. 1 414 22

I 0 414 23
would 0 414 23
love 0 414 23
to 0 414 23
believe 0 414 23
that 0 414 23
the 0 414 23
fact 0 414 23
Julian 0 414 23
has 0 414 23
never 0 414 23
met 0 414 23
Manafort 0 414 23
is 0 414 23
bound 0 414 23
to 0 414 23
be 0 414 23
established. 0 414 23

But 1 414 24
I 1 414 24
fear 1 414 24
that 1 414 24
state 1 414 24
control 1 414 24
of 1 414 24
propaganda 1 414 24
may 1 414 24
be 1 414 24
such 1 414 24
that 1 414 24
this 1 414 24
massive 1 414 24
“Big 1 414 24
Lie” 1 414 24
will 1 414 24
come 1 414 24
to 1 414 24
enter 1 414 24
public 1 414 24
consciousness 1 414 24
in 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
same 1 414 24
way 1 414 24
as 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
non-existent 1 414 24
Russian 1 414 24
hack 1 414 24
of 1 414 24
the 1 414 24
DNC 1 414 24
servers. 1 414 24

Assange 1 414 25
never 1 414 25
met 1 414 25
Manafort. 1 414 25

The 1 414 26
DNC 1 414 26
emails 1 414 26
were 1 414 26
downloaded 1 414 26
by 1 414 26
an 1 414 26
insider. 1 414 26

Assange 1 414 27
never 1 414 27
even 1 414 27
considered 1 414 27
fleeing 1 414 27
to 1 414 27
Russia. 1 414 27

Those 1 414 28
are 1 414 28
the 1 414 28
facts, 1 414 28
and 1 414 28
I 1 414 28
am 1 414 28
in 1 414 28
a 1 414 28
position 1 414 28
to 1 414 28
give 1 414 28
you 1 414 28
a 1 414 28
personal 1 414 28
assurance 1 414 28
of 1 414 28
them. 1 414 28

I 1 414 29
can 1 414 29
also 1 414 29
assure 1 414 29
you 1 414 29
that 1 414 29
Luke 1 414 29
Harding, 1 414 29
the 1 414 29
Guardian, 1 414 29
Washington 1 414 29
Post 1 414 29
and 1 414 29
New 1 414 29
York 1 414 29
Times 1 414 29
have 1 414 29
been 1 414 29
publishing 1 414 29
a 1 414 29
stream 1 414 29
of 1 414 29
deliberate 1 414 29
lies, 1 414 29
in 1 414 29
collusion 1 414 29
with 1 414 29
the 1 414 29
security 1 414 29
services. 1 414 29

I 0 414 30
am 0 414 30
not 0 414 30
a 0 414 30
fan 0 414 30
of 0 414 30
Donald 0 414 30
Trump. 0 414 30

But 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
see 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
partisans 1 414 31
of 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
defeated 1 414 31
candidate 1 414 31
(and 1 414 31
a 1 414 31
particularly 1 414 31
obnoxious 1 414 31
defeated 1 414 31
candidate) 1 414 31
manipulate 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
security 1 414 31
services 1 414 31
and 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
media 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
create 1 414 31
an 1 414 31
entirely 1 414 31
false 1 414 31
public 1 414 31
perception, 1 414 31
in 1 414 31
order 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
attempt 1 414 31
to 1 414 31
overturn 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
result 1 414 31
of 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
US 1 414 31
Presidential 1 414 31
election, 1 414 31
is 1 414 31
the 1 414 31
most 1 414 31
astonishing 1 414 31
thing 1 414 31
I 1 414 31
have 1 414 31
witnessed 1 414 31
in 1 414 31
my 1 414 31
lifetime. 1 414 31

Plainly 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
government 1 414 32
of 1 414 32
Ecuador 1 414 32
is 1 414 32
releasing 1 414 32
lies 1 414 32
about 1 414 32
Assange 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
curry 1 414 32
favour 1 414 32
with 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
security 1 414 32
establishment 1 414 32
of 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
USA 1 414 32
and 1 414 32
UK, 1 414 32
and 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
damage 1 414 32
Assange’s 1 414 32
support 1 414 32
prior 1 414 32
to 1 414 32
expelling 1 414 32
him 1 414 32
from 1 414 32
the 1 414 32
Embassy. 1 414 32

He 1 414 33
will 1 414 33
then 1 414 33
be 1 414 33
extradited 1 414 33
from 1 414 33
London 1 414 33
to 1 414 33
the 1 414 33
USA 1 414 33
on 1 414 33
charges 1 414 33
of 1 414 33
espionage. 1 414 33

Assange 0 414 34
is 0 414 34
not 0 414 34
a 1 414 34
whistleblower 1 414 34
or 1 414 34
a 1 414 34
spy 1 414 34
– 0 414 34
he 0 414 34
is 0 414 34
the 1 414 34
greatest 1 414 34
publisher 1 414 34
of 1 414 34
his 1 414 34
age, 1 414 34
and 1 414 34
has 1 414 34
done 1 414 34
more 1 414 34
to 1 414 34
bring 1 414 34
the 1 414 34
crimes 1 414 34
of 1 414 34
governments 1 414 34
to 1 414 34
light 1 414 34
than 1 414 34
the 1 414 34
mainstream 1 414 34
media 1 414 34
will 1 414 34
ever 1 414 34
be 1 414 34
motivated 1 414 34
to 1 414 34
achieve. 1 414 34

That 1 414 35

“… 0 425 48

we 1 425 48

Then 0 425 50
you 0 425 50

Smith 0 425 53

that 0 425 53
“Gillum 0 425 53

during 0 425 54

on 1 425 54
values 1 425 54
he 1 425 54
does 1 425 54
not 1 425 54

ESERMAN: 0 425 55
“In 0 425 55
order 0 425 55

He’s 0 425 55
really 0 425 55

So 0 425 56
he 0 425 56

not 0 426 29
saying 0 426 29
specifically 0 426 29
like 0 426 29
I’m 0 426 29
going 0 426 29
to 0 426 29
ban 0 426 29

I’m 0 426 29
against 0 426 29
ARs, 0 426 29
only 0 426 29
because 0 426 29
he’s 0 426 29
running 0 426 29
a 0 426 29
race 0 426 29
right 0 426 29
now. 0 426 29

I 0 426 30
do 0 426 30
think 0 426 30
he 0 426 30
would 0 426 30
support 0 426 30
anybody 0 426 30
doing 0 426 30

Nelson. 0 426 30

… 0 426 31
But 1 426 31
I 1 426 31
don’t 1 426 31
think 1 426 31
he 1 426 31
can 1 426 31
say 1 426 31
it 1 426 31
just 1 426 31
[be]cause 1 426 31
he’s 1 426 31
trying 1 426 31
to 1 426 31
get 1 426 31
the 1 426 31

in 0 431 2
the 0 431 2

that 0 431 2

she 0 431 2

her 0 431 19
run 0 431 19
for 0 431 19
Georgia 0 431 19
governor 0 431 19
on 0 431 19
Friday, 0 431 19
but 0 431 19
the 0 431 19
Democrat 0 431 19
said 0 431 19
she 0 431 19
would 0 431 19
not 0 431 19

As 0 431 20
state 0 431 20
officials 0 431 20
prepare 0 431 20
to 0 431 20
certify 0 431 20
the 0 431 20
vote, 0 431 20
Abrams 0 431 20
acknowledged 0 431 20
the 0 431 20
law 0 431 20
“allows 0 431 20
no 0 431 20
further 0 431 20

the 0 431 20
nation’s 0 431 20
first 0 431 20
black 0 431 20
female 0 431 20
governor. 0 431 20

But 0 431 21
she 0 431 21
laced 0 431 21
her 0 431 21
speech 0 431 21
with 0 431 21
biting 0 431 21
criticism 0 431 21
of 0 431 21
Kemp, 0 431 21
who 0 431 21
she 0 431 21
accused 0 431 21
of 0 431 21
leveraging 0 431 21
his 0 431 21
role 0 431 21
as 0 431 21
the 0 431 21
state’s 0 431 21
top 0 431 21
elections 0 431 21
official 0 431 21
to 0 431 21

voters. 0 431 21

“I 0 431 22
will 0 431 22
not 0 431 22
concede,” 0 431 22
she 0 431 22
added, 0 431 22
“because 0 431 22
the 0 431 22
erosion 0 431 22
of 0 431 22
our 0 431 22
democracy 0 431 22
is 0 431 22
not 0 431 22
right.” 0 431 22

You 1 431 23
mean 1 431 23
like 1 431 23
having 1 431 23
a 1 431 23
sister 1 431 23
waiting 1 431 23
in 1 431 23
the 1 431 23
wings 1 431 23
of 1 431 23
any 1 431 23
campaign 1 431 23
lawsuits, 1 431 23
Ms. 1 431 23
Abrams? 1 431 23

What 1 431 24
about 1 431 24
invalid 1 431 24
provisional 1 431 24
ballots 1 431 24
getting 1 431 24
mixed 1 431 24
in 1 431 24
with 1 431 24
valid 1 431 24
ones? 1 431 24

Maybe 1 431 25
a 1 431 25
little 1 431 25
electronic 1 431 25
voter 1 431 25
manipulation, 1 431 25
Ms. 1 431 25
Abrams? 1 431 25

How 1 431 26
about 1 431 26
non-citizens 1 431 26
and 1 431 26
illegal 1 431 26
aliens 1 431 26
voting, 1 431 26
Ms. 1 431 26
Abrams? 1 431 26

Are 0 431 27
these 0 431 27
evidence 0 431 27
of 0 431 27
the 0 431 27
erosion 0 431 27
of 0 431 27
the 0 431 27
democratic 0 431 27
process? 0 431 27

Sure 0 431 28
they 0 431 28
are 0 431 28
and 0 431 28
they 0 431 28
appear 0 431 28
to 0 431 28
all 0 431 28
be 0 431 28
coming 0 431 28
from 0 431 28
the 0 431 28
party 0 431 28
that 0 431 28
Stacey 0 431 28
Abrams 0 431 28
represents, 0 431 28
but 0 431 28
she's 0 431 28
not 0 431 28
going 0 431 28
to 0 431 28
talk 0 431 28
about 0 431 28
that. 0 431 28

But 0 431 29
she 0 431 29
wasn't 0 431 29
going 0 431 29
to 0 431 29
concede. 0 431 29

Nope, 0 431 30
that 0 431 30
arrogant 0 431 30
wanna-be 0 431 30
first 0 431 30
female 0 431 30
governor 0 431 30
of 0 431 30
Georgia 0 431 30
simply 0 431 30
would 0 431 30
not 0 431 30
bow 0 431 30
out 0 431 30
gracefully. 0 431 30

“To 0 431 31
watch 0 431 31
an 0 431 31
elected 0 431 31
official 0 431 31
who 0 431 31
claims 0 431 31
to 0 431 31
represent 0 431 31
the 0 431 31
people 0 431 31
in 0 431 31
this 0 431 31
state 0 431 31
baldly 1 431 31
pin 1 431 31
his 1 431 31
hopes 1 431 31
for 0 431 31
election 0 431 31
on 0 431 31
the 0 431 31
suppression 0 431 31
of 0 431 31
the 0 431 31
people’s 0 431 31
democratic 0 431 31
right 0 431 31
to 0 431 31
vote 0 431 31
has 0 431 31
been 0 431 31
truly 0 431 31
appalling,” 0 431 31
Abrams 0 431 31
said. 0 431 31

“So, 0 431 32
let’s 0 431 32
be 0 431 32
clear," 0 431 32
she 0 431 32
continued. 0 431 32

"This 0 431 33
is 0 431 33
not 0 431 33
a 0 431 33
speech 0 431 33
of 0 431 33
concession. 0 431 33

Because 0 431 34
concession 0 431 34
means 0 431 34
to 0 431 34
acknowledge 0 431 34
an 0 431 34
action 0 431 34
is 0 431 34
right, 0 431 34
true 0 431 34
or 0 431 34
proper. 0 431 34

As 0 431 35
a 0 431 35
woman 0 431 35
of 0 431 35
conscience 0 431 35
and 0 431 35
faith, 0 431 35
I 0 431 35
cannot 0 431 35
concede 0 431 35
that. 0 431 35

But 0 431 36
my 0 431 36
assessment 0 431 36
is 0 431 36
the 0 431 36
law 0 431 36
currently 0 431 36
allows 0 431 36
no 0 431 36
further 0 431 36
viable 0 431 36
remedy.” 0 431 36

No, 0 431 37
concession 0 431 37
means 0 431 37
"a 0 431 37
thing 0 431 37
that 0 431 37
is 0 431 37
granted, 0 431 37
especially 0 431 37
in 0 431 37
response 0 431 37
to 0 431 37
demands; 0 431 37
a 0 431 37
thing 0 431 37
conceded." 0 431 37

Abrams 0 431 38
was 0 431 38
easily 0 431 38
defeated 0 431 38
in 0 431 38
terms 0 431 38
of 0 431 38
votes. 0 431 38

She 0 431 39
was 0 431 39

Patel, 0 444 6
32, 0 444 6
was 0 444 6
the 0 444 6
first 0 444 6
Indian-American 0 444 6
writer 0 444 6
for 0 444 6

Emmy 0 444 6

for 0 444 6
Outstanding 0 444 6

Patel 0 444 7
has 0 444 7
previously 0 444 7
performed 0 444 7
on 0 444 7
Late 0 444 7

such 0 444 7
as 0 444 7

During 0 444 8
the 0 444 8
event, 0 444 8
Patel’s 0 444 8
performance 0 444 8
featured 0 444 8
commentary 0 444 8
on 0 444 8
his 0 444 8
experience 0 444 8
living 0 444 8
in 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
diverse 0 444 8
area 0 444 8
of 0 444 8
New 0 444 8
York 0 444 8
City—including 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
joke 0 444 8
about 0 444 8
a 0 444 8
gay, 0 444 8
black 0 444 8
man 0 444 8
in 0 444 8
his 0 444 8
neighborhood—which 0 444 8
AAA 0 444 8
officials 0 444 8
deemed 0 444 8
inappropriate. 0 444 8

Patel 0 444 9
joked 0 444 9
that 0 444 9
being 0 444 9
gay 0 444 9
cannot 0 444 9
be 0 444 9
a 0 444 9
choice 0 444 9
because 0 444 9
“no 1 444 9
one 1 444 9
looks 1 444 9
in 1 444 9
the 1 444 9
mirror 1 444 9
and 1 444 9
thinks, 1 444 9
‘this 1 444 9
black 1 444 9
thing 1 444 9
is 1 444 9
too 1 444 9
easy, 1 444 9
let 1 444 9
me 1 444 9
just 1 444 9
add 1 444 9
another 1 444 9
thing 1 444 9
to 1 444 9
it.’” 0 444 9

That's 0 444 10
what 0 444 10
Columbia 1 444 10
snowflakes 1 444 10
thought 0 444 10
was 0 444 10
offensive. 0 444 10

I 0 444 11
can't 0 444 11
imagine 0 444 11
what 0 444 11
they 0 444 11
would 0 444 11
have 0 444 11
made 0 444 11
of 0 444 11
Richard 0 444 11
Pryor, 0 444 11
or 0 444 11
at 0 444 11
this 0 444 11
point 0 444 11
even, 0 444 11
Chris 0 444 11
Rock. 0 444 11

It's 0 444 12
also 0 444 12
a 0 444 12
version 0 444 12
of 0 444 12
a 0 444 12
Sammy 0 444 12
Davis 0 444 12
Jr 0 444 12
joke 0 444 12
about 0 444 12
converting 0 444 12
to 0 444 12
Judaism. 0 444 12

Which 0 444 13
is 0 444 13
now 0 444 13
a 0 444 13
hate 0 444 13
crime. 0 444 13

About 0 444 14
30 0 444 14
minutes 0 444 14
into 0 444 14
Patel’s 0 444 14
set, 0 444 14
members 0 444 14
of 0 444 14
AAA 0 444 14
interrupted 0 444 14
the 0 444 14
performance, 0 444 14
denounced 0 444 14
his 0 444 14
jokes 0 444 14
about 0 444 14
racial 0 444 14
identities 0 444 14
and 0 444 14
sexual 0 444 14
orientation, 0 444 14
and 0 444 14
provided 0 444 14
him 0 444 14
with 0 444 14
a 0 444 14
few 0 444 14
moments 0 444 14
for 0 444 14
closing 0 444 14
remarks. 0 444 14

Comrades, 1 444 15
these 1 444 15
jokes 1 444 15
you 1 444 15
have 1 444 15
been 1 444 15
listening 1 444 15
to 1 444 15
are 1 444 15
thought 1 444 15
crimes! 1 444 15

Patel 0 444 16
pushed 0 444 16
back 0 444 16
on 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
officials’ 0 444 16
remarks, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
said 0 444 16
that 0 444 16
while 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
stood 0 444 16
in 0 444 16
solidarity 0 444 16
with 0 444 16
Asian 0 444 16
American 0 444 16
identities, 0 444 16
none 0 444 16
of 0 444 16
his 0 444 16
remarks 0 444 16
were 0 444 16
offensive, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
was 0 444 16
exposing 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
audience 0 444 16
to 0 444 16
ideas 0 444 16
that 0 444 16
would 0 444 16
be 0 444 16
found 0 444 16
“in 0 444 16
the 0 444 16
real 0 444 16
world.” 0 444 16
Before 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
could 0 444 16
finish, 0 444 16
Patel’s 0 444 16
microphone 0 444 16
was 0 444 16
cut 0 444 16
from 0 444 16
off-stage, 0 444 16
and 0 444 16
he 0 444 16
proceeded 0 444 16
to 0 444 16
leave. 0 444 16

The 0 444 17
real 0 444 17
world? 0 444 17

This 0 444 18
is 0 444 18
Columbia. 0 444 18

‘22, 0 444 19

not 0 444 19
in 0 444 19

but 0 444 19
with 0 444 19
Patel’s 0 444 19
closing 0 444 19
remarks. 0 444 19

“I 0 444 20
really 0 444 20
dislike 0 444 20
when 0 444 20
people 0 444 20
who 0 444 20
are 0 444 20
older 0 444 20

the 0 444 20

Obviously 0 444 21
the 0 444 21
world 0 444 21
is 0 444 21
not 0 444 21
a 0 444 21

just 0 444 21
accepting 0 444 21
