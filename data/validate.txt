“Jesus 0 219 38

“The 0 219 39

of 0 331 4
these 0 331 4

Also, 0 331 5
as 0 331 5
this 0 331 5
is 0 331 5
an 0 331 5
unprecedented 0 331 5
moment 0 331 5
in 0 331 5
papal 0 331 5
history, 0 331 5
perhaps 0 331 5
the 0 331 5
unprecedented 0 331 5
step 0 331 5
of 0 331 5

the 0 331 5

also 0 331 5
be 0 331 5
considered 0 331 5
sooner 0 331 5

any 1 331 5
more 1 331 5

serious 0 331 7
is 0 331 7
the 0 331 7
cover-up 0 331 7
that 0 331 7
for 0 331 7
the 0 331 7
good 0 331 7
of 0 331 7
the 0 331 7

But 0 331 8
before 0 331 8

resigns, 0 331 8
we 0 331 8
the 0 331 8

demand 0 331 8

Note: 0 331 11
This 0 331 11

well 0 331 11
mark 0 331 11
the 0 331 11

or 0 331 14
by 0 331 14
their 0 331 14
silence 0 331 14
have 0 331 14
not 0 331 14
prevented 0 331 14
that 0 331 14
such 0 331 14
crimes 0 331 14
continue 0 331 14
to 0 331 14
be 0 331 14
perpetrated. 0 331 14

To 0 331 15
restore 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
beauty 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
holiness 0 331 15
to 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
face 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
Bride 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
Christ, 0 331 15
which 0 331 15
is 0 331 15
terribly 1 331 15
disfigured 1 331 15
by 0 331 15
so 0 331 15
many 0 331 15
abominable 1 331 15
crimes, 1 331 15
and 0 331 15
if 0 331 15
we 0 331 15
truly 0 331 15
want 0 331 15
to 0 331 15
free 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
Church 0 331 15
from 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
fetid 0 331 15
swamp 0 331 15
into 0 331 15
which 0 331 15
she 0 331 15
has 0 331 15
fallen, 0 331 15
we 0 331 15
must 0 331 15
have 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
courage 0 331 15
to 0 331 15
tear 0 331 15
down 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
culture 0 331 15
of 0 331 15
secrecy 0 331 15
and 0 331 15
publicly 0 331 15
confess 0 331 15
the 0 331 15
truths 0 331 15
we 0 331 15
have 0 331 15
kept 0 331 15
hidden. 0 331 15

We 1 331 16
must 1 331 16
tear 0 331 16
down 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
conspiracy 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
silence 0 331 16
with 0 331 16
which 0 331 16
bishops 0 331 16
and 0 331 16
priests 0 331 16
have 0 331 16
protected 0 331 16
themselves 0 331 16
at 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
expense 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
their 0 331 16
faithful, 0 331 16
a 0 331 16
conspiracy 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
silence 0 331 16
that 0 331 16
in 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
eyes 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
world 0 331 16
risks 0 331 16
making 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
Church 0 331 16
look 0 331 16
like 0 331 16
a 0 331 16
sect, 0 331 16
a 0 331 16
conspiracy 0 331 16
of 0 331 16
silence 0 331 16
not 0 331 16
so 0 331 16
dissimilar 0 331 16
from 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
one 0 331 16
that 0 331 16
prevails 0 331 16
in 0 331 16
the 0 331 16
mafia. 0 331 16

“Whatever 0 331 17
you 0 331 17
have 0 331 17
said 0 331 17
in 0 331 17
the 0 331 17
dark 0 331 17
... 0 331 17
shall 0 331 17
be 0 331 17
proclaimed 0 331 17
from 0 331 17
the 0 331 17
housetops” 0 331 17
(Lk. 0 331 17

12:3). 0 331 18

I 0 331 19
had 0 331 19
always 0 331 19
believed 0 331 19
and 0 331 19
hoped 0 331 19
that 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
hierarchy 0 331 19
of 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
Church 0 331 19
could 0 331 19
find 0 331 19
within 0 331 19
itself 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
spiritual 0 331 19
resources 0 331 19
and 0 331 19
strength 0 331 19
to 0 331 19
tell 0 331 19
the 0 331 19
whole 0 331 19
truth, 0 331 19
to 0 331 19
amend 0 331 19
and 0 331 19
to 0 331 19
renew 0 331 19
itself. 0 331 19

That 0 331 20
is 0 331 20
why, 0 331 20
even 0 331 20
though 0 331 20
I 0 331 20
had 0 331 20
repeatedly 0 331 20
been 0 331 20
asked 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
do 0 331 20
so, 0 331 20
I 0 331 20
always 0 331 20
avoided 0 331 20
making 0 331 20
statements 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
the 0 331 20
media, 0 331 20
even 0 331 20
when 0 331 20
it 0 331 20
would 0 331 20
have 0 331 20
been 0 331 20
my 0 331 20
right 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
do 0 331 20
so, 0 331 20
in 0 331 20
order 0 331 20
to 0 331 20
defend 0 331 20
myself 0 331 20
against 0 331 20
the 0 331 20
calumnies 0 331 20
published 0 331 20
about 0 331 20
me, 0 331 20
even 0 331 20
by 0 331 20
high-ranking 0 331 20
prelates 0 331 20
of 0 331 20
the 0 331 20
Roman 0 331 20
Curia. 0 331 20

But 0 331 21
now 0 331 21
that 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
corruption 0 331 21
has 0 331 21
reached 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
very 0 331 21
top 0 331 21
of 0 331 21
the 0 331 21
Church’s 0 331 21
hierarchy, 0 331 21
my 0 331 21
conscience 0 331 21
dictates 0 331 21
that 0 331 21
I 0 331 21
reveal 0 331 21
those 0 331 21
truths 0 331 21
regarding 0 331 21

heart-breaking 0 331 21

To 0 331 24
dispel 0 331 24
suspicions 0 331 24
insinuated 0 331 24
in 0 331 24
several 0 331 24
recent 0 331 24

I 0 331 24
will 0 331 24
immediately 0 331 24
say 0 331 24
that 0 331 24
the 0 331 24
Apostolic 0 331 24
Nuncios 0 331 24
in 0 331 24

Pietro 0 331 24
Sambi, 0 331 24
both 0 331 24
prematurely 0 331 24
deceased, 0 331 24
did 0 331 24
not 0 331 24
fail 0 331 24
to 0 331 24
inform 0 331 24
the 0 331 24
Holy 0 331 24
See 0 331 24
immediately, 0 331 24
as 0 331 24
soon 0 331 24
as 0 331 24
they 0 331 24
learned 0 331 24
of 0 331 24
Archbishop 0 331 24
McCarrick’s 0 331 24
gravely 1 331 24
immoral 1 331 24
behavior 1 331 24
with 0 331 24

Indeed, 0 331 25
according 0 331 25
to 0 331 25
what 0 331 25

In 0 331 26
the 0 331 26

Father 0 331 26

who 0 331 26
had 0 331 26
been 0 331 26
a 0 331 26

at 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
diocesan 0 331 26

in 0 331 26
Newark 0 331 26
from 0 331 26

the 0 331 26
’80s 0 331 26
until 0 331 26
1996, 0 331 26
affirms 0 331 26
that 0 331 26
there 0 331 26
was 0 331 26
a 0 331 26
recurring 0 331 26
rumor 0 331 26
in 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
seminary 0 331 26
that 0 331 26
the 0 331 26
Archbishop 0 331 26
“shared 0 331 26
his 0 331 26
bed 0 331 26

seminarians,” 0 331 26
inviting 0 331 26
five 0 331 26

him 0 331 26
at 0 331 26
his 0 331 26
beach 0 331 26
house. 0 331 26

And 0 331 27
he 0 331 27
added 0 331 27
that 0 331 27
he 0 331 27
knew 0 331 27
a 0 331 27
certain 0 331 27
number 0 331 27
of 0 331 27
seminarians, 0 331 27
some 0 331 27
of 0 331 27
whom 0 331 27
were 0 331 27
later 0 331 27

for 0 331 27
the 0 331 27

to 0 331 27
this 0 331 27

by 0 331 28
the 0 331 28
Holy 0 331 28
See 0 331 28
after 0 331 28
those 0 331 28

brought 0 331 28
by 0 331 28

the 0 331 28

The 0 331 30
Nuncio 0 331 30
added 0 331 30
that 0 331 30
Littleton 0 331 30
had 0 331 30
already 0 331 30
forwarded 0 331 30
his 0 331 30
Memorandum 0 331 30
to 0 331 30
about 0 331 30
twenty 0 331 30
people, 0 331 30
including 0 331 30
civil 0 331 30

ecclesiastical 0 331 30
judicial 0 331 30
authorities, 0 331 30

lawyers, 0 331 30
in 0 331 30
June 0 331 30
2006, 0 331 30
and 0 331 30
that 0 331 30
it 0 331 30
was 0 331 30
therefore 0 331 30
very 0 331 30
likely 0 331 30
that 0 331 30
the 0 331 30
news 0 331 30
would 0 331 30
soon 0 331 30
be 0 331 30
made 0 331 30
public. 0 331 30

He 0 331 31
therefore 0 331 31
called 0 331 31
for 0 331 31
a 0 331 31
prompt 0 331 31
intervention 0 331 31

that 0 331 34
it 0 331 34
seemed 0 331 34
a 0 331 34
new 0 331 34

of 0 331 34
particular 0 331 34

as 0 331 34
it 0 331 34
regarded 0 331 34

and 0 331 35
that, 0 331 35
since 0 331 35
this 0 331 35
matter 0 331 35
had 0 331 35
to 0 331 35
do 0 331 35
with 0 331 35
a 0 331 35
cardinal, 0 331 35
and 0 331 35
according 0 331 35

- 0 331 38
I 0 331 38
proposed 0 331 38
that 0 331 38
an 0 331 38
exemplary 0 331 38
measure 0 331 38
be 0 331 38
taken 0 331 38
against 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
Cardinal 0 331 38
that 0 331 38
could 0 331 38
have 0 331 38
a 0 331 38
medicinal 0 331 38
function, 0 331 38
to 0 331 38
prevent 0 331 38
future 0 331 38
abuses 0 331 38
against 0 331 38
innocent 0 331 38
victims 0 331 38
and 0 331 38
alleviate 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
very 0 331 38
serious 0 331 38
scandal 0 331 38
for 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
faithful, 0 331 38
who 0 331 38
despite 0 331 38
everything 0 331 38
continued 0 331 38
to 0 331 38
love 0 331 38
and 0 331 38
believe 0 331 38
in 0 331 38
the 0 331 38
Church. 0 331 38

I 0 331 39
added 0 331 39
that 0 331 39
it 0 331 39
would 0 331 39
be 0 331 39
salutary 0 331 39
if, 0 331 39
for 0 331 39
once, 0 331 39
ecclesiastical 0 331 39
authority 0 331 39
would 0 331 39
intervene 0 331 39
before 0 331 39
the 0 331 39
civil 0 331 39
authorities 0 331 39
and, 0 331 39
if 0 331 39
possible, 0 331 39
before 0 331 39
the 0 331 39
scandal 0 331 39
had 0 331 39
broken 0 331 39
out 0 331 39
in 0 331 39
the 0 331 39
press. 0 331 39

This 0 331 40
could 0 331 40
have 0 331 40
restored 0 331 40
some 0 331 40
dignity 0 331 40
to 0 331 40
a 0 331 40
Church 0 331 40
so 0 331 40
sorely 0 331 40
tried 0 331 40
and 0 331 40
humiliated 0 331 40
by 0 331 40
so 0 331 40
many 0 331 40
abominable 0 331 40
acts 0 331 40
on 0 331 40
the 0 331 40
part 0 331 40
of 0 331 40
some 0 331 40
pastors. 0 331 40

If 0 331 41
this 0 331 41
were 0 331 41
done, 0 331 41
the 0 331 41
civil 0 331 41
authority 0 331 41
would 0 331 41
no 0 331 41
longer 0 331 41
have 0 331 41
to 0 331 41
judge 0 331 41
a 0 331 41
cardinal, 0 331 41
but 0 331 41
a 0 331 41
pastor 0 331 41
with 0 331 41
whom 0 331 41
the 0 331 41
Church 0 331 41
had 0 331 41
already 0 331 41
taken 0 331 41
appropriate 0 331 41
measures 0 331 41
to 0 331 41
prevent 0 331 41
the 0 331 41
cardinal 0 331 41
from 0 331 41
abusing 0 331 41
his 0 331 41
authority 0 331 41
and 0 331 41
continuing 0 331 41
to 0 331 41
destroy 1 331 41
innocent 0 331 41
victims. 0 331 41

My 0 331 42
memo 0 331 42
of 0 331 42
December 0 331 42
6, 0 331 42

The 0 331 46
following 0 331 46

I 0 331 46
delivered 0 331 46
a 0 331 46
new 0 331 46

to 0 331 46
the 0 331 46
new 0 331 46

Fernando 0 331 46

included 0 331 46
my 0 331 46
previous 0 331 46

of 0 331 46
December 0 331 46
6, 0 331 46
2006. 0 331 46

In 0 331 47
it, 0 331 47
I 0 331 47
summarized 0 331 47
Richard 0 331 47
Sipe’s 0 331 47
document, 0 331 47
which 0 331 47
ended 0 331 47
with 0 331 47
this 0 331 47
respectful 0 331 47
and 0 331 47
heartfelt 0 331 47
appeal 0 331 47
to 0 331 47
Pope 0 331 47
Benedict 0 331 47
XVI: 0 331 47
“I 0 331 47
approach 0 331 47
Your 0 331 47
Holiness 0 331 47
with 0 331 47
due 0 331 47
reverence, 0 331 47
but 0 331 47
with 0 331 47
the 0 331 47
same 0 331 47
intensity 0 331 47
that 0 331 47
motivated 0 331 47
Peter 0 331 47
Damian 0 331 47
to 0 331 47
lay 0 331 47
out 0 331 47
before 0 331 47
your 0 331 47
predecessor, 0 331 47
Pope 0 331 47
Leo 0 331 47
IX, 0 331 47
a 0 331 47
description 0 331 47
of 0 331 47
the 0 331 47
condition 0 331 47
of 0 331 47
the 0 331 47
clergy 0 331 47
during 0 331 47
his 0 331 47
time. 0 331 47

The 0 331 48
problems 0 331 48
he 0 331 48
spoke 0 331 48
of 0 331 48
are 0 331 48
similar 0 331 48
and 0 331 48
as 0 331 48
great 0 331 48
now 0 331 48
in 0 331 48
the 0 331 48
United 0 331 48

If 0 331 49
Your 0 331 49

I 0 331 49
will 0 331 49

about 0 331 49

I 0 331 49

I 0 331 50

my 0 331 50
memo 0 331 50
by 0 331 50
repeating 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
my 0 331 50
superiors 0 331 50
that 0 331 50
I 0 331 50
thought 0 331 50
it 0 331 50
was 0 331 50
necessary 0 331 50

intervene 0 331 50
as 0 331 50
soon 0 331 50
as 0 331 50
possible 0 331 50
by 0 331 50
removing 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
cardinal’s 0 331 50
hat 0 331 50
from 0 331 50
Cardinal 0 331 50
McCarrick 0 331 50
and 0 331 50
that 0 331 50
he 0 331 50
should 0 331 50
be 0 331 50
subjected 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
sanctions 0 331 50
established 0 331 50
by 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
Code 0 331 50
of 0 331 50
Canon 0 331 50
Law, 0 331 50
which 0 331 50
also 0 331 50
provide 0 331 50
for 0 331 50
reduction 0 331 50
to 0 331 50
the 0 331 50
lay 0 331 50
state. 0 331 50

This 0 331 51
second 0 331 51
memo 0 331 51
of 0 331 51
mine 0 331 51
was 0 331 51
also 0 331 51
never 0 331 51
returned 0 331 51
to 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
Personnel 0 331 51
Office, 0 331 51
and 0 331 51
I 0 331 51
was 0 331 51
greatly 1 331 51
dismayed 1 331 51
at 0 331 51
my 0 331 51
superiors 0 331 51
for 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
inconceivable 0 331 51
absence 0 331 51
of 0 331 51
any 0 331 51
measure 0 331 51
against 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
Cardinal, 0 331 51
and 0 331 51
for 0 331 51
the 0 331 51
continuing 0 331 51
lack 0 331 51
of 0 331 51
any 0 331 51
communication 0 331 51
with 0 331 51
me 0 331 51
since 0 331 51
my 0 331 51
first 0 331 51
memo 0 331 51
in 0 331 51
December 0 331 51
2006. 0 331 51

But 0 331 52
finally 0 331 52
I 0 331 52
learned 0 331 52
with 0 331 52
certainty, 0 331 52
through 0 331 52
Cardinal 0 331 52
Giovanni 0 331 52
Battista 0 331 52
Re, 0 331 52
then-Prefect 0 331 52
of 0 331 52
the 0 331 52
Congregation 0 331 52
for 0 331 52
Bishops, 0 331 52
that 0 331 52
Richard 0 331 52
Sipe’s 0 331 52
courageous 1 331 52
and 1 331 52
meritorious 1 331 52
Statement 0 331 52
had 0 331 52
had 0 331 52
the 0 331 52
desired 0 331 52
result. 0 331 52

Pope 0 331 53
Benedict 0 331 53
had 0 331 53
imposed 0 331 53
on 0 331 53
Cardinal 0 331 53
McCarrick 0 331 53
sanctions 0 331 53
similar 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
those 0 331 53
now 0 331 53
imposed 0 331 53
on 0 331 53
him 0 331 53
by 0 331 53
Pope 0 331 53
Francis: 0 331 53
the 0 331 53
Cardinal 0 331 53
was 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
leave 0 331 53
the 0 331 53
seminary 0 331 53
where 0 331 53
he 0 331 53
was 0 331 53
living, 0 331 53
he 0 331 53
was 0 331 53
forbidden 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
celebrate 0 331 53
[Mass] 0 331 53
in 0 331 53
public, 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
participate 0 331 53
in 0 331 53
public 0 331 53
meetings, 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
give 0 331 53
lectures, 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
travel, 0 331 53
with 0 331 53
the 0 331 53
obligation 0 331 53
of 0 331 53
dedicating 0 331 53
himself 0 331 53
to 0 331 53
a 0 331 53
life 0 331 53
of 0 331 53
prayer 0 331 53
and 0 331 53
penance. 0 331 53

I 0 331 54
do 0 331 54
not 0 331 54
know 0 331 54
when 0 331 54
Pope 0 331 54
Benedict 0 331 54
took 0 331 54
these 0 331 54
measures 0 331 54
against 0 331 54
McCarrick, 0 331 54
whether 0 331 54
in 0 331 54
2009 0 331 54
or 0 331 54
2010, 0 331 54
because 0 331 54
in 0 331 54
the 0 331 54
meantime 0 331 54
I 0 331 54
had 0 331 54
been 0 331 54
transferred 0 331 54
to 0 331 54
the 0 331 54
Governorate 0 331 54
of 0 331 54
Vatican 0 331 54
City 0 331 54
State, 0 331 54
just 0 331 54
as 0 331 54
I 0 331 54
do 0 331 54
not 0 331 54
know 0 331 54
who 0 331 54
was 0 331 54
responsible 0 331 54
for 0 331 54
this 0 331 54
incredible 1 331 54
delay. 0 331 54

I 0 331 55
certainly 0 331 55
do 0 331 55
not 0 331 55
believe 0 331 55
it 0 331 55
was 0 331 55
Pope 0 331 55
Benedict, 0 331 55
who 0 331 55
as 0 331 55
Cardinal 0 331 55
had 0 331 55
repeatedly 0 331 55
denounced 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
corruption 0 331 55
present 0 331 55
in 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
Church, 0 331 55
and 0 331 55
in 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
first 0 331 55
months 0 331 55
of 0 331 55
his 0 331 55
pontificate 0 331 55
had 0 331 55
already 0 331 55
taken 0 331 55
a 0 331 55
firm 0 331 55
stand 0 331 55
against 0 331 55
the 0 331 55
admission 0 331 55
into 0 331 55
seminary 0 331 55
of 0 331 55
young 0 331 55
men 0 331 55
with 0 331 55
deep 0 331 55
homosexual 0 331 55
tendencies. 0 331 55

I 0 331 56
believe 0 331 56
it 0 331 56
was 0 331 56
due 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
Pope’s 0 331 56
first 0 331 56
collaborator 0 331 56
at 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
time, 0 331 56
Cardinal 0 331 56
Tarcisio 0 331 56
Bertone, 0 331 56
who 0 331 56
notoriously 0 331 56
favored 0 331 56
promoting 0 331 56
homosexuals 0 331 56
into 0 331 56
positions 0 331 56
of 0 331 56
responsibility, 0 331 56
and 0 331 56
was 0 331 56
accustomed 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
managing 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
information 0 331 56
he 0 331 56
thought 0 331 56
appropriate 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
convey 0 331 56
to 0 331 56
the 0 331 56
Pope. 0 331 56

In 0 331 57
any 0 331 57
case, 0 331 57
what 0 331 57
is 0 331 57
certain 0 331 57
is 0 331 57
that 0 331 57
Pope 0 331 57
Benedict 0 331 57
imposed 0 331 57
the 0 331 57
above 0 331 57
canonical 0 331 57
sanctions 0 331 57
on 0 331 57
McCarrick 0 331 57
and 0 331 57
that 0 331 57
they 0 331 57
were 0 331 57
communicated 0 331 57
to 0 331 57
him 0 331 57
by 0 331 57
the 0 331 57
Apostolic 0 331 57
Nuncio 0 331 57
to 0 331 57
the 0 331 57
United 0 331 57
States, 0 331 57
Pietro 0 331 57
Sambi. 0 331 57

Monsignor 0 331 58
Jean-François 0 331 58
Lantheaume, 0 331 58
then 0 331 58
first 0 331 58
Counsellor 0 331 58
of 0 331 58
the 0 331 58
Nunciature 0 331 58
in 0 331 58
Washington 0 331 58
and 0 331 58
Chargé 0 331 58
d'Affaires 0 331 58
a.i. 0 331 58

after 0 331 59
the 0 331 59
unexpected 0 331 59
death 0 331 59
of 0 331 59
Nuncio 0 331 59
Sambi 0 331 59
in 0 331 59
Baltimore, 0 331 59
told 0 331 59
me 0 331 59
when 0 331 59
I 0 331 59
arrived 0 331 59
in 0 331 59
Washington 0 331 59
— 0 331 59
and 0 331 59
he 0 331 59
is 0 331 59
ready 0 331 59
to 0 331 59
testify 0 331 59
to 0 331 59
it— 0 331 59
about 0 331 59
a 0 331 59
stormy 0 331 59
conversation, 0 331 59
lasting 0 331 59
over 0 331 59
an 0 331 59
hour, 0 331 59
that 0 331 59
Nuncio 0 331 59
Sambi 0 331 59
had 0 331 59
with 0 331 59
Cardinal 0 331 59
McCarrick 0 331 59
whom 0 331 59
he 0 331 59
had 0 331 59
summoned 0 331 59
to 0 331 59
the 0 331 59
Nunciature. 0 331 59

Monsignor 0 331 60
Lantheaume 0 331 60
told 0 331 60
me 0 331 60
that 0 331 60
“the 0 331 60
Nuncio’s 0 331 60
voice 0 331 60
could 0 331 60
be 0 331 60
heard 0 331 60
all 0 331 60
the 0 331 60
way 0 331 60
out 0 331 60
in 0 331 60
the 0 331 60
corridor.” 0 331 60

Pope 0 331 61
Benedict’s 0 331 61
same 0 331 61
dispositions 0 331 61
were 0 331 61
then 0 331 61
also 0 331 61
communicated 0 331 61
to 0 331 61
me 0 331 61
by 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
new 0 331 61
Prefect 0 331 61
of 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
Congregation 0 331 61
for 0 331 61
Bishops, 0 331 61
Cardinal 0 331 61
Marc 0 331 61
Ouellet, 0 331 61
in 0 331 61
November 0 331 61
2011, 0 331 61
in 0 331 61
a 0 331 61
conversation 0 331 61
before 0 331 61
my 0 331 61
departure 0 331 61
for 0 331 61
Washington, 0 331 61
and 0 331 61
were 0 331 61
included 0 331 61
among 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
instructions 0 331 61
of 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
same 0 331 61
Congregation 0 331 61
to 0 331 61
the 0 331 61
new 0 331 61
Nuncio. 0 331 61

In 0 331 62
turn, 0 331 62
I 0 331 62
repeated 0 331 62
them 0 331 62
to 0 331 62
Cardinal 0 331 62
McCarrick 0 331 62
at 0 331 62
my 0 331 62
first 0 331 62
meeting 0 331 62
with 0 331 62
him 0 331 62
at 0 331 62
the 0 331 62
Nunciature. 0 331 62

The 0 331 63
Cardinal, 0 331 63
muttering 0 331 63
in 0 331 63
a 0 331 63
barely 0 331 63
comprehensible 0 331 63
way, 0 331 63
admitted 0 331 63
that 0 331 63
he 0 331 63
had 0 331 63
perhaps 0 331 63
made 0 331 63
the 0 331 63
mistake 0 331 63
of 0 331 63
sleeping 0 331 63
in 0 331 63
the 0 331 63
same 0 331 63
bed 0 331 63
with 0 331 63
some 0 331 63
seminarians 0 331 63
at 0 331 63
his 0 331 63
beach 0 331 63
house, 0 331 63
but 0 331 63
he 0 331 63
said 0 331 63
this 0 331 63
as 0 331 63
if 0 331 63
it 0 331 63
had 0 331 63
no 0 331 63
importance. 0 331 63

The 0 331 64
faithful 0 331 64
insistently 0 331 64
wonder 0 331 64
how 0 331 64
it 0 331 64
was 0 331 64
possible 0 331 64
for 0 331 64
him 0 331 64
to 0 331 64
be 0 331 64
appointed 0 331 64
to 0 331 64
Washington, 0 331 64
and 0 331 64
as 0 331 64
Cardinal, 0 331 64
and 0 331 64
they 0 331 64
have 0 331 64
every 0 331 64
right 0 331 64
to 0 331 64
know 0 331 64
who 0 331 64
knew, 0 331 64
and 0 331 64
who 0 331 64
covered 0 331 64
up 0 331 64
his 0 331 64
grave 1 331 64
misdeeds. 1 331 64

It 0 331 65
is 0 331 65
therefore 0 331 65
my 0 331 65
duty 0 331 65
to 0 331 65
reveal 0 331 65
what 0 331 65
I 0 331 65
know 0 331 65
about 0 331 65
this, 0 331 65
beginning 0 331 65
with 0 331 65
the 0 331 65
Roman 0 331 65
Curia. 0 331 65

Cardinal 0 331 66
Angelo 0 331 66
Sodano 0 331 66
was 0 331 66
Secretary 0 331 66
of 0 331 66
State 0 331 66
until 0 331 66
September 0 331 66
2006: 0 331 66
all 0 331 66
information 0 331 66
was 0 331 66
communicated 0 331 66
to 0 331 66
him. 0 331 66

In 0 331 67
November 0 331 67
2000, 0 331 67
Nunzio 0 331 67
Montalvo 0 331 67
sent 0 331 67
him 0 331 67
his 0 331 67
report, 0 331 67
passing 0 331 67
on 0 331 67
to 0 331 67
him 0 331 67
the 0 331 67
aforementioned 0 331 67
letter 0 331 67
from 0 331 67
Father 0 331 67
Boniface 0 331 67
Ramsey 0 331 67
in 0 331 67
which 0 331 67
he 0 331 67
denounced 0 331 67
the 0 331 67
serious 0 331 67
abuses 0 331 67
committed 0 331 67
by 0 331 67
McCarrick. 0 331 67

It 0 331 68
is 0 331 68
known 0 331 68
that 0 331 68
Sodano 0 331 68
tried 0 331 68
to 0 331 68
cover 0 331 68
up 0 331 68
the 0 331 68
Father 0 331 68
Maciel 0 331 68
scandal 0 331 68
to 0 331 68
the 0 331 68
end. 0 331 68

He 0 331 69
even 0 331 69
removed 0 331 69
the 0 331 69
Nuncio 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
Mexico 0 331 69
City, 0 331 69
Justo 0 331 69
Mullor, 0 331 69
who 0 331 69
refused 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
be 0 331 69
an 0 331 69
accomplice 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
his 0 331 69
scheme 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
cover 0 331 69
Maciel, 0 331 69
and 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
his 0 331 69
place 0 331 69
appointed 0 331 69
Sandri, 0 331 69
then-Nuncio 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
Venezuela, 0 331 69
who 0 331 69
was 0 331 69
willing 0 331 69
to 0 331 69
collaborate 0 331 69
in 0 331 69
the 0 331 69
cover-up. 0 331 69

Sodano 0 331 70
even 0 331 70
went 0 331 70
so 0 331 70
far 0 331 70
as 0 331 70
to 0 331 70
issue 0 331 70
a 0 331 70
statement 0 331 70
to 0 331 70
the 0 331 70
Vatican 0 331 70
press 0 331 70
office 0 331 70
in 0 331 70
which 0 331 70
a 0 331 70
falsehood 0 331 70
was 0 331 70
affirmed, 0 331 70
that 0 331 70
is, 0 331 70
that 0 331 70
Pope 0 331 70
Benedict 0 331 70
had 0 331 70
decided 0 331 70
that 0 331 70
the 0 331 70
Maciel 0 331 70
case 0 331 70
should 0 331 70
be 0 331 70
considered 0 331 70
closed. 0 331 70

Benedict 0 331 71
reacted, 0 331 71
despite 0 331 71
Sodano’s 0 331 71
strenuous 0 331 71
defense, 0 331 71
and 0 331 71
Maciel 0 331 71
was 0 331 71
found 0 331 71
guilty 0 331 71
and 0 331 71
irrevocably 0 331 71
condemned. 0 331 71

Was 0 331 72
McCarrick’s 0 331 72
appointment 0 331 72
to 0 331 72
Washington 0 331 72
and 0 331 72
as 0 331 72
Cardinal 0 331 72
the 0 331 72
work 0 331 72
of 0 331 72
Sodano, 0 331 72
when 0 331 72
John 0 331 72
Paul 0 331 72
II 0 331 72
was 0 331 72
already 0 331 72
very 0 331 72
ill? 0 331 72

We 0 331 73
are 0 331 73
not 0 331 73
given 0 331 73
to 0 331 73
know. 0 331 73

However, 0 331 74
it 0 331 74
is 0 331 74
legitimate 0 331 74
to 0 331 74
think 0 331 74
so, 0 331 74
but 0 331 74
I 0 331 74
do 0 331 74
not 0 331 74
think 0 331 74
he 0 331 74
was 0 331 74
the 0 331 74
only 0 331 74
one 0 331 74
responsible 0 331 74
for 0 331 74
this. 0 331 74

McCarrick 0 331 75
frequently 0 331 75
went 0 331 75
to 0 331 75
Rome 0 331 75
and 0 331 75
made 0 331 75
friends 0 331 75
everywhere, 0 331 75
at 0 331 75
all 0 331 75
levels 0 331 75
of 0 331 75
the 0 331 75
Curia. 0 331 75

If 0 331 76
Sodano 0 331 76
had 0 331 76
protected 0 331 76
Maciel, 0 331 76
as 0 331 76
seems 0 331 76
certain, 0 331 76
there 0 331 76
is 0 331 76
no 0 331 76
reason 0 331 76
why 0 331 76
he 0 331 76
wouldn’t 0 331 76
have 0 331 76
done 0 331 76
so 0 331 76
for 0 331 76
McCarrick, 0 331 76
who 0 331 76
according 0 331 76
to 0 331 76
many 0 331 76
had 0 331 76
the 0 331 76
financial 0 331 76
means 0 331 76
to 0 331 76
influence 0 331 76
decisions. 0 331 76

His 0 331 77
nomination 0 331 77
to 0 331 77
Washington 0 331 77
was 0 331 77
opposed 0 331 77

disassociates 0 331 78
himself 0 331 78
from 0 331 78

states 0 331 78
that 0 331 78
McCarrick 0 331 78

14th 0 331 78

all 0 331 79

As 0 331 81
already 0 331 81

the 0 331 81
Cardinal 0 331 81

of 0 331 81
Vigevano 0 331 81
and 0 331 81
later 0 331 81
removed 0 331 81

situation 0 331 95
is 0 331 95
now 0 331 95
completely 0 331 95
compromised 0 331 95
by 0 331 95
the 0 331 95
recent 0 331 95
revelations 0 331 95
regarding 0 331 95
his 0 331 95
behavior 0 331 95
as 0 331 95
Bishop 0 331 95
of 0 331 95
Pittsburgh. 0 331 95

It 0 331 96
is 0 331 96
absolutely 0 331 96
unthinkable 0 331 96
that 0 331 96
Nunzio 0 331 96
Sambi, 0 331 96
who 0 331 96
was 0 331 96
an 0 331 96
extremely 0 331 96
responsible 0 331 96
person, 0 331 96
loyal, 0 331 96
direct 0 331 96
and 0 331 96
explicit 0 331 96
in 0 331 96
his 0 331 96
way 0 331 96
of 0 331 96
being 0 331 96
(a 0 331 96
true 0 331 96
son 0 331 96
of 0 331 96
Romagna) 0 331 96
did 0 331 96
not 0 331 96
speak 0 331 96
to 0 331 96
him 0 331 96
about 0 331 96
it. 0 331 96

In 0 331 97
any 0 331 97
case, 0 331 97
I 0 331 97
myself 0 331 97
brought 0 331 97
up 0 331 97
the 0 331 97
subject 0 331 97
with 0 331 97
Cardinal 0 331 97
Wuerl 0 331 97
on 0 331 97
several 0 331 97
occasions, 0 331 97
and 0 331 97
I 0 331 97
certainly 0 331 97
didn’t 0 331 97
need 0 331 97
to 0 331 97
go 0 331 97
into 0 331 97
detail 0 331 97
because 0 331 97
it 0 331 97
was 0 331 97
immediately 0 331 97
clear 0 331 97
to 0 331 97
me 0 331 97
that 0 331 97
he 0 331 97
was 0 331 97
fully 0 331 97
aware 0 331 97
of 0 331 97
it. 0 331 97

I 0 331 98
also 0 331 98
remember 0 331 98
in 0 331 98
particular 0 331 98
the 0 331 98
fact 0 331 98
that 0 331 98
I 0 331 98
had 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
draw 0 331 98
his 0 331 98
attention 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
it, 0 331 98
because 0 331 98
I 0 331 98
realized 0 331 98
that 0 331 98
in 0 331 98
an 0 331 98
archdiocesan 0 331 98
publication, 0 331 98
on 0 331 98
the 0 331 98
back 0 331 98
cover 0 331 98
in 0 331 98
color, 0 331 98
there 0 331 98
was 0 331 98
an 0 331 98
announcement 0 331 98
inviting 0 331 98
young 0 331 98
men 0 331 98
who 0 331 98
thought 0 331 98
they 0 331 98
had 0 331 98
a 0 331 98
vocation 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
the 0 331 98
priesthood 0 331 98
to 0 331 98
a 0 331 98
meeting 0 331 98
with 0 331 98
Cardinal 0 331 98
McCarrick. 0 331 98

I 0 331 99
immediately 0 331 99
phoned 0 331 99
Cardinal 0 331 99
Wuerl, 0 331 99
who 0 331 99
expressed 0 331 99
his 0 331 99
surprise 0 331 99
to 0 331 99
me, 0 331 99
telling 0 331 99
me 0 331 99
that 0 331 99
he 0 331 99
knew 0 331 99
nothing 0 331 99
about 0 331 99
that 0 331 99
announcement 0 331 99
and 0 331 99
that 0 331 99
he 0 331 99
would 0 331 99
cancel 0 331 99
it. 0 331 99

If, 0 331 100
as 0 331 100
he 0 331 100
now 0 331 100
continues 0 331 100
to 0 331 100
state, 0 331 100
he 0 331 100
knew 0 331 100
nothing 0 331 100
of 0 331 100
the 0 331 100
abuses 0 331 100
committed 0 331 100
by 0 331 100
McCarrick 0 331 100
and 0 331 100
the 0 331 100
measures 0 331 100
taken 0 331 100
by 0 331 100
Pope 0 331 100
Benedict, 0 331 100
how 0 331 100
can 0 331 100
his 0 331 100
answer 0 331 100
be 0 331 100
explained? 0 331 100

His 0 331 101
recent 0 331 101
statements 0 331 101
that 0 331 101
he 0 331 101
knew 0 331 101
nothing 0 331 101
about 0 331 101
it, 0 331 101
even 0 331 101
though 0 331 101
at 0 331 101
first 0 331 101
he 0 331 101
cunningly 0 331 101
referred 0 331 101
to 0 331 101
compensation 0 331 101
for 0 331 101
the 0 331 101
two 0 331 101
victims, 0 331 101
are 0 331 101
absolutely 1 331 101
laughable. 1 331 101

The 0 331 102
Cardinal 0 331 102
lies 0 331 102
shamelessly 1 331 102
and 0 331 102
prevails 0 331 102
upon 0 331 102
his 0 331 102
Chancellor, 0 331 102
Monsignor 0 331 102
Antonicelli, 0 331 102
to 0 331 102
lie 0 331 102
as 0 331 102
well. 0 331 102

Cardinal 0 331 103
Wuerl 0 331 103
also 0 331 103
clearly 0 331 103
lied 0 331 103
on 0 331 103
another 0 331 103
occasion. 0 331 103

Following 0 331 104
a 0 331 104
morally 0 331 104
unacceptable 0 331 104
event 0 331 104
authorized 0 331 104
by 0 331 104
the 0 331 104
academic 0 331 104
authorities 0 331 104
of 0 331 104
Georgetown 0 331 104
University, 0 331 104
I 0 331 104
brought 0 331 104
it 0 331 104
to 0 331 104
the 0 331 104
attention 0 331 104
of 0 331 104
its 0 331 104
President, 0 331 104
Dr. 0 331 104
John 0 331 104
DeGioia, 0 331 104
sending 0 331 104
him 0 331 104
two 0 331 104
subsequent 0 331 104
letters. 0 331 104

Before 0 331 105
forwarding 0 331 105
them 0 331 105
to 0 331 105
the 0 331 105
addressee, 0 331 105
so 0 331 105
as 0 331 105
to 0 331 105
handle 0 331 105
things 0 331 105
properly, 0 331 105
I 0 331 105
personally 0 331 105
gave 0 331 105
a 0 331 105
copy 0 331 105
of 0 331 105
them 0 331 105
to 0 331 105
the 0 331 105
Cardinal 0 331 105
with 0 331 105
an 0 331 105
accompanying 0 331 105
letter 0 331 105
I 0 331 105
had 0 331 105
written. 0 331 105

The 0 331 106
Cardinal 0 331 106
told 0 331 106
me 0 331 106
that 0 331 106
he 0 331 106
knew 0 331 106
nothing 0 331 106
about 0 331 106
it. 0 331 106

However, 0 331 107
he 0 331 107
failed 0 331 107
to 0 331 107
acknowledge 0 331 107
receipt 0 331 107
of 0 331 107
my 0 331 107
two 0 331 107
letters, 0 331 107
contrary 0 331 107
to 0 331 107
what 0 331 107
he 0 331 107
customarily 0 331 107
did. 0 331 107

I 0 331 108
subsequently 0 331 108
learned 0 331 108
that 0 331 108
the 0 331 108
event 0 331 108
at 0 331 108
Georgetown 0 331 108
had 0 331 108
taken 0 331 108
place 0 331 108
for 0 331 108
seven 0 331 108
years. 0 331 108

But 0 331 109
the 0 331 109
Cardinal 0 331 109
knew 0 331 109
nothing 0 331 109
about 0 331 109
it! 0 331 109

Cardinal 0 331 110
Wuerl, 0 331 110
well 0 331 110
aware 0 331 110
of 0 331 110
the 0 331 110
continuous 0 331 110
abuses 0 331 110
committed 0 331 110
by 0 331 110
Cardinal 0 331 110
McCarrick 0 331 110
and 0 331 110
the 0 331 110
sanctions 0 331 110
imposed 0 331 110
on 0 331 110
him 0 331 110
by 0 331 110
Pope 0 331 110
Benedict, 0 331 110
transgressing 0 331 110
the 0 331 110
Pope’s 0 331 110
order, 0 331 110
also 0 331 110
allowed 0 331 110
him 0 331 110
to 0 331 110
reside 0 331 110
at 0 331 110
a 0 331 110
seminary 0 331 110
in 0 331 110
Washington 0 331 110
D.C. 0 331 110

In 0 331 111
doing 0 331 111
so, 0 331 111
he 0 331 111
put 0 331 111
other 0 331 111
seminarians 0 331 111
at 0 331 111
risk. 0 331 111

Bishop 0 331 112
Paul 0 331 112
Bootkoski, 0 331 112
emeritus 0 331 112
of 0 331 112
Metuchen, 0 331 112
and 0 331 112
Archbishop 0 331 112
John 0 331 112
Myers, 0 331 112
emeritus 0 331 112
of 0 331 112
Newark, 0 331 112
covered 0 331 112
up 0 331 112
the 0 331 112
abuses 0 331 112
committed 0 331 112
by 0 331 112
McCarrick 0 331 112
in 0 331 112
their 0 331 112
respective 0 331 112
dioceses 0 331 112
and 0 331 112
compensated 0 331 112
two 0 331 112
of 0 331 112
his 0 331 112
victims. 0 331 112

They 0 331 113
cannot 0 331 113
deny 0 331 113
it 0 331 113
and 0 331 113
they 0 331 113
must 0 331 113
be 0 331 113
interrogated 0 331 113
in 0 331 113
order 0 331 113
to 0 331 113
reveal 0 331 113
every 0 331 113
circumstance 0 331 113
and 0 331 113
all 0 331 113
responsibility 0 331 113
regarding 0 331 113
this 0 331 113
matter. 0 331 113

Cardinal 0 331 114
Kevin 0 331 114
Farrell, 0 331 114
who 0 331 114
was 0 331 114
recently 0 331 114
interviewed 0 331 114
by 0 331 114
the 0 331 114
media, 0 331 114
also 0 331 114
said 0 331 114
that 0 331 114
he 0 331 114
didn’t 0 331 114
have 0 331 114
the 0 331 114
slightest 0 331 114
idea 0 331 114
about 0 331 114
the 0 331 114
abuses 0 331 114
committed 0 331 114
by 0 331 114
McCarrick. 0 331 114

Given 0 331 115
his 0 331 115
tenure 0 331 115
in 0 331 115
Washington, 0 331 115
Dallas 0 331 115
and 0 331 115
now 0 331 115
Rome, 0 331 115
I 0 331 115
think 0 331 115
no 0 331 115
one 0 331 115
can 0 331 115
honestly 0 331 115
believe 0 331 115
him. 0 331 115

I 0 331 116
don’t 0 331 116
know 0 331 116
if 0 331 116
he 0 331 116
was 0 331 116
ever 0 331 116
asked 0 331 116
if 0 331 116
he 0 331 116
knew 0 331 116
about 0 331 116
Maciel’s 0 331 116
crimes. 0 331 116

If 0 331 117
he 0 331 117
were 0 331 117
to 0 331 117
deny 0 331 117
this, 0 331 117
would 0 331 117
anybody 0 331 117
believe 0 331 117
him 0 331 117
given 0 331 117
that 0 331 117
he 0 331 117
occupied 0 331 117
positions 0 331 117
of 0 331 117
responsibility 0 331 117
as 0 331 117
a 0 331 117
member 0 331 117
of 0 331 117
the 0 331 117
Legionaries 0 331 117
of 0 331 117
Christ? 0 331 117

Regarding 0 331 118
Cardinal 0 331 118
Sean 0 331 118
O’Malley, 0 331 118
I 0 331 118
would 0 331 118
simply 0 331 118
say 0 331 118
that 0 331 118
his 0 331 118
latest 0 331 118
statements 0 331 118
on 0 331 118
the 0 331 118
McCarrick 0 331 118
case 0 331 118
are 0 331 118
disconcerting, 1 331 118
and 0 331 118
have 0 331 118
totally 1 331 118
obscured 0 331 118
his 0 331 118
transparency 0 331 118
and 0 331 118
credibility. 0 331 118

* 0 331 119
* 0 331 119

My 0 331 120
conscience 0 331 120
requires 0 331 120
me 0 331 120
also 0 331 120
to 0 331 120
reveal 0 331 120
facts 0 331 120
that 0 331 120
I 0 331 120
have 0 331 120
experienced 0 331 120
personally, 0 331 120
concerning 0 331 120
Pope 0 331 120
Francis, 0 331 120
that 0 331 120
have 0 331 120
a 0 331 120
dramatic 1 331 120
significance, 0 331 120
which 0 331 120
as 0 331 120
Bishop, 0 331 120
sharing 0 331 120
the 0 331 120
collegial 0 331 120
responsibility 0 331 120
of 0 331 120
all 0 331 120

bishops 0 331 120
for 0 331 120
the 0 331 120
universal 0 331 120
Church, 0 331 120
do 0 331 120
not 0 331 120
allow 0 331 120
me 0 331 120
to 0 331 120
remain 0 331 120
silent, 0 331 120
and 0 331 120
that 0 331 120
I 0 331 120
state 0 331 120
here, 0 331 120
ready 0 331 120
to 0 331 120
reaffirm 0 331 120
them 0 331 120
under 0 331 120
oath 0 331 120
by 0 331 120
calling 0 331 120
on 0 331 120
God 0 331 120
as 0 331 120
my 0 331 120
witness. 0 331 120

In 0 331 121
the 0 331 121
last 0 331 121
months 0 331 121
of 0 331 121
his 0 331 121
pontificate, 0 331 121
Pope 0 331 121
Benedict 0 331 121
XVI 0 331 121
had 0 331 121
convened 0 331 121
a 0 331 121
meeting 0 331 121
of 0 331 121
all 0 331 121
the 0 331 121
apostolic 0 331 121
nuncios 0 331 121
in 0 331 121
Rome, 0 331 121
as 0 331 121
Paul 0 331 121
VI 0 331 121
and 0 331 121
St. 0 331 121
John 0 331 121
Paul 0 331 121
II 0 331 121
had 0 331 121
done 0 331 121
on 0 331 121
several 0 331 121
occasions. 0 331 121

The 0 331 122
date 0 331 122
set 0 331 122
for 0 331 122
the 0 331 122
audience 0 331 122
with 0 331 122
the 0 331 122
Pope 0 331 122
was 0 331 122
Friday, 0 331 122
June 0 331 122
21, 0 331 122
2013. 0 331 122

Pope 0 331 123
Francis 0 331 123
kept 0 331 123
this 0 331 123
commitment 0 331 123
made 0 331 123
by 0 331 123
his 0 331 123
predecessor. 0 331 123

Of 0 331 124
course 0 331 124
I 0 331 124
also 0 331 124
came 0 331 124
to 0 331 124
Rome 0 331 124
from 0 331 124
Washington. 0 331 124

It 0 331 125
was 0 331 125
my 0 331 125
first 0 331 125
meeting 0 331 125
with 0 331 125
the 0 331 125
new 0 331 125
Pope 0 331 125
elected 0 331 125
only 0 331 125
three 0 331 125
months 0 331 125
prior, 0 331 125
after 0 331 125
the 0 331 125
resignation 0 331 125
of 0 331 125
Pope 0 331 125
Benedict. 0 331 125

On 0 331 126
the 0 331 126
morning 0 331 126
of 0 331 126
Thursday, 0 331 126
June 0 331 126
20, 0 331 126
2013, 0 331 126
I 0 331 126
went 0 331 126
to 0 331 126
the 0 331 126
Domus 0 331 126
Sanctae 0 331 126
Marthae, 0 331 126
to 0 331 126
join 0 331 126
my 0 331 126
colleagues 0 331 126
who 0 331 126
were 0 331 126
staying 0 331 126
there. 0 331 126

As 0 331 127
soon 0 331 127
as 0 331 127
I 0 331 127
entered 0 331 127
the 0 331 127
hall 0 331 127
I 0 331 127
met 0 331 127
Cardinal 0 331 127
McCarrick, 0 331 127
who 0 331 127
wore 0 331 127
the 0 331 127
red-trimmed 0 331 127
cassock. 0 331 127

I 0 331 128
greeted 0 331 128
him 0 331 128
respectfully 0 331 128
as 0 331 128
I 0 331 128
had 0 331 128
always 0 331 128
done. 0 331 128

He 0 331 129
immediately 0 331 129
said 0 331 129
to 0 331 129
me, 0 331 129
in 0 331 129
a 0 331 129
tone 0 331 129
somewhere 0 331 129
between 0 331 129
ambiguous 0 331 129
and 0 331 129
triumphant: 0 331 129
“The 0 331 129
Pope 0 331 129
received 0 331 129
me 0 331 129
yesterday, 0 331 129
tomorrow 0 331 129
I 0 331 129
am 0 331 129
going 0 331 129
to 0 331 129
China.” 0 331 129

At 0 331 130
the 0 331 130
time 0 331 130
I 0 331 130
knew 0 331 130
nothing 0 331 130
of 0 331 130
his 0 331 130
long 0 331 130
friendship 0 331 130
with 0 331 130
Cardinal 0 331 130
Bergoglio 0 331 130
and 0 331 130
of 0 331 130
the 0 331 130
important 0 331 130
part 0 331 130
he 0 331 130
had 0 331 130
played 0 331 130
in 0 331 130
his 0 331 130
recent 0 331 130
election, 0 331 130
as 0 331 130
McCarrick 0 331 130
himself 0 331 130
would 0 331 130
later 0 331 130
reveal 0 331 130
in 0 331 130
a 0 331 130
lecture 0 331 130
at 0 331 130
Villanova 0 331 130
University 0 331 130
and 0 331 130
in 0 331 130
an 0 331 130
interview 0 331 130
with 0 331 130
the 0 331 130
National 0 331 130
Catholic 0 331 130
Reporter. 0 331 130

Nor 0 331 131
had 0 331 131
I 0 331 131
ever 0 331 131
thought 0 331 131
of 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
fact 0 331 131
that 0 331 131
he 0 331 131
had 0 331 131
participated 0 331 131
in 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
preliminary 0 331 131
meetings 0 331 131
of 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
recent 0 331 131
conclave, 0 331 131
and 0 331 131
of 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
role 0 331 131
he 0 331 131
had 0 331 131
been 0 331 131
able 0 331 131
to 0 331 131
have 0 331 131
as 0 331 131
a 0 331 131
cardinal 0 331 131
elector 0 331 131
in 0 331 131
the 0 331 131
2005 0 331 131
conclave. 0 331 131

Therefore 0 331 132
I 0 331 132
did 0 331 132
not 0 331 132
immediately 0 331 132
grasp 0 331 132
the 0 331 132
meaning 0 331 132
of 0 331 132
the 0 331 132
encrypted 0 331 132
message 0 331 132
that 0 331 132
McCarrick 0 331 132
had 0 331 132
communicated 0 331 132
to 0 331 132
me, 0 331 132
but 0 331 132
that 0 331 132
would 0 331 132
become 0 331 132
clear 0 331 132
to 0 331 132
me 0 331 132
in 0 331 132
the 0 331 132
days 0 331 132
immediately 0 331 132
following. 0 331 132

The 0 331 133
next 0 331 133
day 0 331 133
the 0 331 133
audience 0 331 133
with 0 331 133
Pope 0 331 133
Francis 0 331 133
took 0 331 133
place. 0 331 133

After 0 331 134
his 0 331 134
address, 0 331 134
which 0 331 134
was 0 331 134
partly 0 331 134
read 0 331 134
and 0 331 134
partly 0 331 134
delivered 0 331 134
off 0 331 134
the 0 331 134
cuff, 0 331 134
the 0 331 134
Pope 0 331 134
wished 0 331 134
to 0 331 134
greet 0 331 134
all 0 331 134
the 0 331 134
nuncios 0 331 134
one 0 331 134
by 0 331 134
one. 0 331 134

In 0 331 135
single 0 331 135
file, 0 331 135
I 0 331 135
remember 0 331 135
that 0 331 135
I 0 331 135
was 0 331 135
among 0 331 135
the 0 331 135
last. 0 331 135

When 0 331 136
it 0 331 136
was 0 331 136
my 0 331 136
turn, 0 331 136
I 0 331 136
just 0 331 136
had 0 331 136
time 0 331 136
to 0 331 136
say 0 331 136
to 0 331 136
him, 0 331 136
“I 0 331 136
am 0 331 136
the 0 331 136
Nuncio 0 331 136
to 0 331 136
the 0 331 136
United 0 331 136
States.” 0 331 136
He 0 331 136
immediately 0 331 136
assailed 0 331 136
me 0 331 136
with 0 331 136
a 0 331 136
tone 0 331 136
of 0 331 136
reproach, 0 331 136
using 0 331 136
these 0 331 136
words: 0 331 136
“The 0 331 136
Bishops 0 331 136
in 0 331 136
the 0 331 136
United 0 331 136
States 0 331 136
must 0 331 136
not 0 331 136
be 0 331 136
ideologized! 0 331 136

They 0 331 137
must 0 331 137
be 0 331 137
shepherds!”Of 0 331 137
course 0 331 137
I 0 331 137
was 0 331 137
not 0 331 137
in 0 331 137
a 0 331 137
position 0 331 137
to 0 331 137
ask 0 331 137
for 0 331 137
explanations 0 331 137
about 0 331 137
the 0 331 137
meaning 0 331 137
of 0 331 137
his 0 331 137
words 0 331 137
and 0 331 137
the 0 331 137
aggressive 1 331 137
way 0 331 137
in 0 331 137
which 0 331 137
he 0 331 137
had 0 331 137
upbraided 0 331 137
me. 0 331 137

I 0 331 138
had 0 331 138
in 0 331 138
my 0 331 138
hand 0 331 138
a 0 331 138
book 0 331 138
in 0 331 138
Portuguese 0 331 138
that 0 331 138
Cardinal 0 331 138
O’Malley 0 331 138
had 0 331 138
sent 0 331 138
me 0 331 138
for 0 331 138
the 0 331 138
Pope 0 331 138
a 0 331 138
few 0 331 138
days 0 331 138
earlier, 0 331 138
telling 0 331 138
me 0 331 138
“so 0 331 138
he 0 331 138
could 0 331 138
go 0 331 138
over 0 331 138
his 0 331 138
Portuguese 0 331 138
before 0 331 138
going 0 331 138
to 0 331 138
Rio 0 331 138
for 0 331 138
World 0 331 138
Youth 0 331 138
Day.” 0 331 138
I 0 331 138
handed 0 331 138
it 0 331 138
to 0 331 138
him 0 331 138
immediately, 0 331 138
and 0 331 138
so 0 331 138
freed 0 331 138
myself 0 331 138
from 0 331 138
that 0 331 138
extremely 0 331 138
disconcerting 0 331 138
and 0 331 138
embarrassing 0 331 138
situation. 0 331 138

At 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
end 0 331 139
of 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
audience 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
Pope 0 331 139
announced: 0 331 139
“Those 0 331 139
of 0 331 139
you 0 331 139
who 0 331 139
are 0 331 139
still 0 331 139
in 0 331 139
Rome 0 331 139
next 0 331 139
Sunday 0 331 139
are 0 331 139
invited 0 331 139
to 0 331 139
concelebrate 0 331 139
with 0 331 139
me 0 331 139
at 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
Domus 0 331 139
Sanctae 0 331 139
Marthae.” 0 331 139
I 0 331 139
naturally 0 331 139
thought 0 331 139
of 0 331 139
staying 0 331 139
on 0 331 139
to 0 331 139
clarify 0 331 139
as 0 331 139
soon 0 331 139
as 0 331 139
possible 0 331 139
what 0 331 139
the 0 331 139
Pope 0 331 139
intended 0 331 139
to 0 331 139
tell 0 331 139
me. 0 331 139

On 0 331 140
Sunday 0 331 140
June 0 331 140
23, 0 331 140
before 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
concelebration 0 331 140
with 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
Pope, 0 331 140
I 0 331 140
asked 0 331 140
Monsignor 0 331 140
Ricca, 0 331 140
who 0 331 140
as 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
person 0 331 140
in 0 331 140
charge 0 331 140
of 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
house 0 331 140
helped 0 331 140
us 0 331 140
put 0 331 140
on 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
vestments, 0 331 140
if 0 331 140
he 0 331 140
could 0 331 140
ask 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
Pope 0 331 140
if 0 331 140
he 0 331 140
could 0 331 140
receive 0 331 140
me 0 331 140
sometime 0 331 140
in 0 331 140
the 0 331 140
following 0 331 140
week. 0 331 140

How 0 331 141
could 0 331 141
I 0 331 141
have 0 331 141
returned 0 331 141
to 0 331 141
Washington 0 331 141
without 0 331 141
having 0 331 141
clarified 0 331 141
what 0 331 141
the 0 331 141
Pope 0 331 141
wanted 0 331 141
of 0 331 141
me? 0 331 141

At 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
end 0 331 142
of 0 331 142
Mass, 0 331 142
while 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
Pope 0 331 142
was 0 331 142
greeting 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
few 0 331 142
lay 0 331 142
people 0 331 142
present, 0 331 142
Monsignor 0 331 142
Fabian 0 331 142
Pedacchio, 0 331 142
his 0 331 142
Argentine 0 331 142
secretary, 0 331 142
came 0 331 142
to 0 331 142
me 0 331 142
and 0 331 142
said: 0 331 142
“The 0 331 142
Pope 0 331 142
told 0 331 142
me 0 331 142
to 0 331 142
ask 0 331 142
if 0 331 142
you 0 331 142
are 0 331 142
free 0 331 142
now!” 0 331 142
Naturally, 0 331 142
I 0 331 142
replied 0 331 142
that 0 331 142
I 0 331 142
was 0 331 142
at 0 331 142
the 0 331 142
Pope’s 0 331 142
disposal 0 331 142
and 0 331 142
that 0 331 142
I 0 331 142
thanked 0 331 142
him 0 331 142
for 0 331 142
receiving 0 331 142
me 0 331 142
immediately. 0 331 142

The 0 331 143
Pope 0 331 143
took 0 331 143
me 0 331 143
to 0 331 143
the 0 331 143
first 0 331 143
floor 0 331 143
in 0 331 143
his 0 331 143
apartment 0 331 143
and 0 331 143
said: 0 331 143
“We 0 331 143
have 0 331 143
40 0 331 143
minutes 0 331 143
before 0 331 143
the 0 331 143
Angelus.” 0 331 143

I 0 331 144
began 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
conversation, 0 331 144
asking 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
Pope 0 331 144
what 0 331 144
he 0 331 144
intended 0 331 144
to 0 331 144
say 0 331 144
to 0 331 144
me 0 331 144
with 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
words 0 331 144
he 0 331 144
had 0 331 144
addressed 0 331 144
to 0 331 144
me 0 331 144
when 0 331 144
I 0 331 144
greeted 0 331 144
him 0 331 144
the 0 331 144
previous 0 331 144
Friday. 0 331 144

And 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Pope, 0 331 145
in 0 331 145
a 0 331 145
very 0 331 145
different, 0 331 145
friendly, 0 331 145
almost 0 331 145
affectionate 0 331 145
tone, 0 331 145
said 0 331 145
to 0 331 145
me: 0 331 145
“Yes, 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Bishops 0 331 145
in 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
United 0 331 145
States 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
ideologized, 0 331 145
they 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
right-wing 0 331 145
like 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Archbishop 0 331 145
of 0 331 145
Philadelphia, 0 331 145
(the 0 331 145
Pope 0 331 145
did 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
give 0 331 145
me 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
name 0 331 145
of 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
Archbishop) 0 331 145
they 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
shepherds; 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
they 0 331 145
must 0 331 145
not 0 331 145
be 0 331 145
left-wing 0 331 145
— 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
he 0 331 145
added, 0 331 145
raising 0 331 145
both 0 331 145
arms 0 331 145
— 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
when 0 331 145
I 0 331 145
say 0 331 145
left-wing 0 331 145
I 0 331 145
mean 0 331 145
homosexual.” 0 331 145
Of 0 331 145
course, 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
logic 0 331 145
of 0 331 145
the 0 331 145
correlation 0 331 145
between 0 331 145
being 0 331 145
left-wing 0 331 145
and 0 331 145
being 0 331 145
homosexual 0 331 145
escaped 0 331 145
me, 0 331 145
but 0 331 145
I 0 331 145
added 0 331 145
nothing 0 331 145
else. 0 331 145

Immediately 0 331 146
after, 0 331 146
the 0 331 146
Pope 0 331 146
asked 0 331 146
me 0 331 146
in 0 331 146
a 0 331 146
deceitful 0 331 146
way: 0 331 146
“What 0 331 146
is 0 331 146
Cardinal 0 331 146
McCarrick 0 331 146
like?” 0 331 146
I 0 331 146
answered 0 331 146
him 0 331 146
with 0 331 146
complete 0 331 146
frankness 0 331 146
and, 0 331 146
if 0 331 146
you 0 331 146
want, 0 331 146
with 0 331 146
great 0 331 146
naiveté: 0 331 146
“Holy 0 331 146
Father, 0 331 146
I 0 331 146
don’t 0 331 146
know 0 331 146
if 0 331 146
you 0 331 146
know 0 331 146
Cardinal 0 331 146
McCarrick, 0 331 146
but 0 331 146
if 0 331 146
you 0 331 146
ask 0 331 146
the 0 331 146
Congregation 0 331 146
for 0 331 146
Bishops 0 331 146
there 0 331 146
is 0 331 146
a 0 331 146
dossier 0 331 146
this 0 331 146
thick 0 331 146
about 0 331 146
him. 0 331 146

He 0 331 147
corrupted 0 331 147
generations 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
seminarians 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
priests 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
Pope 0 331 147
Benedict 0 331 147
ordered 0 331 147
him 0 331 147
to 0 331 147
withdraw 0 331 147
to 0 331 147
a 0 331 147
life 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
prayer 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
penance.” 0 331 147
The 0 331 147
Pope 0 331 147
did 0 331 147
not 0 331 147
make 0 331 147
the 0 331 147
slightest 0 331 147
comment 0 331 147
about 0 331 147
those 0 331 147
very 1 331 147
grave 1 331 147
words 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
mine 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
did 0 331 147
not 0 331 147
show 0 331 147
any 0 331 147
expression 0 331 147
of 0 331 147
surprise 0 331 147
on 0 331 147
his 0 331 147
face, 0 331 147
as 0 331 147
if 0 331 147
he 0 331 147
had 0 331 147
already 0 331 147
known 0 331 147
the 0 331 147
matter 0 331 147
for 0 331 147
some 0 331 147
time, 0 331 147
and 0 331 147
he 0 331 147
immediately 0 331 147
changed 0 331 147
the 0 331 147
subject. 0 331 147

But 0 331 148
then, 0 331 148
what 0 331 148
was 0 331 148
the 0 331 148
Pope’s 0 331 148
purpose 0 331 148
in 0 331 148
asking 0 331 148
me 0 331 148
that 0 331 148
question: 0 331 148
“What 0 331 148
is 0 331 148
Cardinal 0 331 148
McCarrick 0 331 148
like?” 0 331 148
He 0 331 148
clearly 0 331 148
wanted 0 331 148
to 0 331 148
find 0 331 148
out 0 331 148
if 0 331 148
I 0 331 148
was 0 331 148
an 0 331 148
ally 0 331 148
of 0 331 148
McCarrick 0 331 148
or 0 331 148
not. 0 331 148

Back 0 331 149
in 0 331 149
Washington 0 331 149
everything 0 331 149
became 0 331 149
very 0 331 149
clear 0 331 149
to 0 331 149
me, 0 331 149
thanks 0 331 149
also 0 331 149
to 0 331 149
a 0 331 149
new 0 331 149
event 0 331 149
that 0 331 149
occurred 0 331 149
only 0 331 149
a 0 331 149
few 0 331 149
days 0 331 149
after 0 331 149
my 0 331 149
meeting 0 331 149
with 0 331 149
Pope 0 331 149
Francis. 0 331 149

When 0 331 150
the 0 331 150
new 0 331 150
Bishop 0 331 150
Mark 0 331 150
Seitz 0 331 150
took 0 331 150
possession 0 331 150
of 0 331 150
the 0 331 150
Diocese 0 331 150
of 0 331 150
El 0 331 150
Paso 0 331 150
on 0 331 150
July 0 331 150
9, 0 331 150
2013, 0 331 150
I 0 331 150
sent 0 331 150
the 0 331 150
first 0 331 150
Counsellor, 0 331 150
Monsignor 0 331 150
Jean-François 0 331 150
Lantheaume, 0 331 150
while 0 331 150
I 0 331 150
went 0 331 150
to 0 331 150
Dallas 0 331 150
that 0 331 150
same 0 331 150
day 0 331 150
for 0 331 150
an 0 331 150
international 0 331 150
meeting 0 331 150
on 0 331 150
Bioethics. 0 331 150

When 0 331 151
he 0 331 151
got 0 331 151
back, 0 331 151
Monsignor 0 331 151
Lantheaume 0 331 151
told 0 331 151
me 0 331 151
that 0 331 151
in 0 331 151
El 0 331 151
Paso 0 331 151
he 0 331 151
had 0 331 151
met 0 331 151
Cardinal 0 331 151
McCarrick 0 331 151
who, 0 331 151
taking 0 331 151
him 0 331 151
aside, 0 331 151
told 0 331 151
him 0 331 151
almost 0 331 151
the 0 331 151
same 0 331 151
words 0 331 151
that 0 331 151
the 0 331 151
Pope 0 331 151
had 0 331 151
said 0 331 151
to 0 331 151
me 0 331 151
in 0 331 151
Rome: 0 331 151
“the 0 331 151
Bishops 0 331 151
in 0 331 151
the 0 331 151
United 0 331 151
States 0 331 151
must 0 331 151
not 0 331 151
be 0 331 151
ideologized, 0 331 151
they 0 331 151
must 0 331 151
not 0 331 151
be 0 331 151
right-wing, 0 331 151
they 0 331 151
must 0 331 151
be 0 331 151
shepherds….” 0 331 151
I 0 331 151
was 0 331 151
astounded! 0 331 151

It 0 331 152
was 0 331 152
therefore 0 331 152
clear 0 331 152
that 0 331 152
the 0 331 152
words 0 331 152
of 0 331 152
reproach 0 331 152
that 0 331 152
Pope 0 331 152
Francis 0 331 152
had 0 331 152
addressed 0 331 152
to 0 331 152
me 0 331 152
on 0 331 152
June 0 331 152
21, 0 331 152
2013 0 331 152
had 0 331 152
been 0 331 152
put 0 331 152
into 0 331 152
his 0 331 152
mouth 0 331 152
the 0 331 152
day 0 331 152
before 0 331 152
by 0 331 152
Cardinal 0 331 152
McCarrick. 0 331 152

Also 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
Pope’s 0 331 153
mention 0 331 153
“not 0 331 153
like 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
Archbishop 0 331 153
of 0 331 153
Philadelphia” 0 331 153
could 0 331 153
be 0 331 153
traced 0 331 153
to 0 331 153
McCarrick, 0 331 153
because 0 331 153
there 0 331 153
had 0 331 153
been 0 331 153
a 0 331 153
strong 0 331 153
disagreement 0 331 153
between 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
two 0 331 153
of 0 331 153
them 0 331 153
about 0 331 153
the 0 331 153
admission 0 331 153
to 0 331 153
Communion 0 331 153
of 0 331 153
pro-abortion 0 331 153
politicians. 0 331 153

In 0 331 154
his 0 331 154
communication 0 331 154
to 0 331 154
the 0 331 154
bishops, 0 331 154
McCarrick 0 331 154
had 0 331 154
manipulated 0 331 154
a 0 331 154
letter 0 331 154
of 0 331 154
then-Cardinal 0 331 154
Ratzinger 0 331 154
who 0 331 154
prohibited 0 331 154
giving 0 331 154
them 0 331 154
Communion. 0 331 154

Indeed, 0 331 155
I 0 331 155
also 0 331 155
knew 0 331 155
how 0 331 155
certain 0 331 155
Cardinals 0 331 155
such 0 331 155
as 0 331 155
Mahony, 0 331 155
Levada 0 331 155
and 0 331 155
Wuerl, 0 331 155
were 0 331 155
closely 0 331 155
linked 0 331 155
to 0 331 155
McCarrick; 0 331 155
they 0 331 155
had 0 331 155
opposed 0 331 155
the 0 331 155
most 0 331 155
recent 0 331 155
appointments 0 331 155
made 0 331 155
by 0 331 155
Pope 0 331 155
Benedict, 0 331 155
for 0 331 155
important 0 331 155
posts 0 331 155
such 0 331 155
as 0 331 155
Philadelphia, 0 331 155
Baltimore, 0 331 155
Denver 0 331 155
and 0 331 155
San 0 331 155
Francisco. 0 331 155

Not 0 331 156
happy 0 331 156
with 0 331 156
the 0 331 156
trap 0 331 156
he 0 331 156
had 0 331 156
set 0 331 156
for 0 331 156
me 0 331 156
on 0 331 156
June 0 331 156
23, 0 331 156
2013, 0 331 156
when 0 331 156
he 0 331 156
asked 0 331 156
me 0 331 156
about 0 331 156
McCarrick, 0 331 156
only 0 331 156
a 0 331 156
few 0 331 156
months 0 331 156
later, 0 331 156
in 0 331 156
the 0 331 156
audience 0 331 156
he 0 331 156
granted 0 331 156
me 0 331 156
on 0 331 156
October 0 331 156
10, 0 331 156
2013, 0 331 156
Pope 0 331 156
Francis 0 331 156
set 0 331 156
a 0 331 156
second 0 331 156
one 0 331 156
for 0 331 156
me, 0 331 156
this 0 331 156
time 0 331 156
concerning 0 331 156
a 0 331 156
second 0 331 156
of 0 331 156
his 0 331 156
protégés, 0 331 156
Cardinal 0 331 156
Donald 0 331 156
Wuerl. 0 331 156

He 0 331 157
asked 0 331 157
me: 0 331 157
“What 0 331 157
is 0 331 157
Cardinal 0 331 157
Wuerl 0 331 157
like, 0 331 157
is 0 331 157
he 0 331 157
good 0 331 157
or 0 331 157
bad?” 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
replied, 0 331 157
“Holy 0 331 157
Father, 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
will 0 331 157
not 0 331 157
tell 0 331 157
you 0 331 157
if 0 331 157
he 0 331 157
is 0 331 157
good 0 331 157
or 0 331 157
bad, 0 331 157
but 0 331 157
I 0 331 157
will 0 331 157
tell 0 331 157
you 0 331 157
two 0 331 157

I 0 331 157
have 0 331 157
already 0 331 157
mentioned 0 331 157

Once 0 331 158
again 0 331 158
the 0 331 158

any 0 331 158
reaction. 0 331 158

It 0 331 159
was 0 331 159
also 0 331 159
clear 0 331 159
that, 0 331 159
from 0 331 159

Wuerl, 0 331 165
united 0 331 165
by 0 331 165
a 0 331 165
wicked 1 331 165
pact 0 331 165
of 0 331 165
abuses 0 331 165
by 0 331 165
the 0 331 165
first, 0 331 165
and 0 331 165
at 0 331 165

of 0 331 165

other 0 331 165
two. 0 331 165

Their 0 331 166
names 0 331 166
were 0 331 166
not 0 331 166

Newark. 0 331 166

Regarding 0 331 167
Cupich, 0 331 167
one 0 331 167
cannot 0 331 167
fail 0 331 167
to 0 331 167
note 0 331 167
his 0 331 167
ostentatious 1 331 167
arrogance, 1 331 167
and 0 331 167
the 0 331 167
insolence 0 331 167
with 0 331 167
which 0 331 167
he 0 331 167
denies 0 331 167
the 0 331 167
evidence 0 331 167
that 0 331 167
is 0 331 167
now 0 331 167
obvious 0 331 167
to 0 331 167
all: 0 331 167
that 0 331 167
80% 0 331 167
of 0 331 167
the 0 331 167
abuses 0 331 167
found 0 331 167
were 0 331 167
committed 0 331 167
against 0 331 167
young 0 331 167
adults 0 331 167
by 0 331 167
homosexuals 0 331 167
who 0 331 167
were 0 331 167
in 0 331 167
a 0 331 167
relationship 0 331 167
of 0 331 167
authority 0 331 167
over 0 331 167
their 0 331 167
victims. 0 331 167

During 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
speech 0 331 168
he 0 331 168
gave 0 331 168
when 0 331 168
he 0 331 168
took 0 331 168
possession 0 331 168
of 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
Chicago 0 331 168
See, 0 331 168
at 0 331 168
which 0 331 168
I 0 331 168
was 0 331 168
present 0 331 168
as 0 331 168
a 0 331 168
representative 0 331 168
of 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
Pope, 0 331 168
Cupich 0 331 168
quipped 0 331 168
that 0 331 168
one 0 331 168
certainly 0 331 168
should 0 331 168
not 0 331 168
expect 0 331 168
the 0 331 168
new 0 331 168
Archbishop 0 331 168
to 0 331 168
walk 0 331 168
on 0 331 168
water. 0 331 168

Perhaps 0 331 169
it 0 331 169
would 0 331 169
be 0 331 169
enough 0 331 169
for 0 331 169
him 0 331 169
to 0 331 169
be 0 331 169
able 0 331 169
to 0 331 169
remain 0 331 169
with 0 331 169
his 0 331 169
feet 0 331 169
on 0 331 169
the 0 331 169
ground 0 331 169
and 0 331 169
not 0 331 169
try 0 331 169
to 0 331 169
turn 0 331 169
reality 0 331 169
upside-down, 0 331 169
blinded 0 331 169
by 0 331 169
his 0 331 169
pro-gay 0 331 169
ideology, 0 331 169
as 0 331 169
he 0 331 169
stated 0 331 169
in 0 331 169
a 0 331 169
recent 0 331 169
interview 0 331 169
with 0 331 169
America 0 331 169

Extolling 0 331 170
his 0 331 170
particular 0 331 170
expertise 0 331 170
in 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
matter, 0 331 170
having 0 331 170
been 0 331 170
President 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
Committee 0 331 170

Young 0 331 170
People 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
USCCB, 0 331 170
he 0 331 170
asserted 0 331 170
that 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
main 0 331 170
problem 0 331 170
in 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
crisis 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
sexual 0 331 170
abuse 0 331 170
by 0 331 170
clergy 0 331 170
is 0 331 170
not 0 331 170
homosexuality, 0 331 170
and 0 331 170
that 0 331 170
affirming 0 331 170
this 0 331 170
is 0 331 170
only 0 331 170
a 0 331 170
way 0 331 170
of 0 331 170
diverting 0 331 170
attention 0 331 170
from 0 331 170
the 0 331 170
real 0 331 170
problem 0 331 170
which 0 331 170
is 0 331 170
clericalism. 0 331 170

In 0 331 171
support 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
this 0 331 171
thesis, 0 331 171
Cupich 0 331 171
“oddly” 0 331 171
made 0 331 171

results 0 331 171
of 0 331 171

carried 0 331 171
out 0 331 171
at 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
height 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
sexual 0 331 171
abuse 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
minors 0 331 171
crisis 0 331 171
in 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
early 0 331 171
2000s, 0 331 171
while 0 331 171
he 0 331 171
“candidly” 0 331 171
ignored 0 331 171
that 0 331 171
the 0 331 171
results 0 331 171
of 0 331 171
that 0 331 171
investigation 0 331 171
were 0 331 171
totally 0 331 171
denied 0 331 171
by 0 331 171

a 0 331 177
sad 0 331 177
recent 0 331 177
example 0 331 177
of 0 331 177

Pope 0 331 178
Francis 0 331 178
has 0 331 178
repeatedly 0 331 178
asked 0 331 178
for 0 331 178
total 0 331 178
transparency 0 331 178
in 0 331 178

throughout 0 331 179
the 0 331 179
world 0 331 179
also 0 331 179
demand 0 331 179
this 0 331 179
of 0 331 179
him 0 331 179
in 0 331 179
an 0 331 179
exemplary 0 331 179
manner. 0 331 179

He 0 331 180
must 0 331 180
honestly 0 331 180
state 0 331 180
when 0 331 180
he 0 331 180
first 0 331 180
learned 0 331 180
about 0 331 180
the 0 331 180
crimes 0 331 180
committed 0 331 180
by 0 331 180
McCarrick, 0 331 180
who 0 331 180
abused 0 331 180
his 0 331 180
authority 0 331 180
with 0 331 180
seminarians 0 331 180
and 0 331 180
priests. 0 331 180

In 0 331 181
any 0 331 181
case, 0 331 181
the 0 331 181
Pope 0 331 181
learned 0 331 181
about 0 331 181
it 0 331 181
from 0 331 181
me 0 331 181
on 0 331 181
June 0 331 181
23, 0 331 181
2013 0 331 181

continued 0 331 181
to 0 331 181
cover 0 331 181
for 0 331 181
him. 0 331 181

He 0 331 182
did 0 331 182
not 0 331 182
take 0 331 182
into 0 331 182
account 0 331 182
the 0 331 182
sanctions 0 331 182
that 0 331 182
Pope 0 331 182
Benedict 0 331 182
had 0 331 182
imposed 0 331 182
on 0 331 182
him 0 331 182
and 0 331 182
made 0 331 182
him 0 331 182
his 0 331 182
trusted 0 331 182
counselor 0 331 182
along 0 331 182
with 0 331 182
Maradiaga. 0 331 182

The 0 331 183
latter 0 331 183
[Maradiaga] 0 331 183
is 0 331 183
so 0 331 183
confident 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
Pope’s 0 331 183
protection 0 331 183
that 0 331 183
he 0 331 183
can 0 331 183
dismiss 0 331 183
as 0 331 183
“gossip” 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
heartfelt 0 331 183
appeals 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
dozens 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
his 0 331 183
seminarians, 0 331 183
who 0 331 183
found 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
courage 0 331 183
to 0 331 183
write 0 331 183
to 0 331 183
him 0 331 183
after 0 331 183
one 0 331 183
of 0 331 183
them 0 331 183
tried 0 331 183
to 0 331 183
commit 0 331 183
suicide 0 331 183
over 0 331 183
homosexual 0 331 183
abuse 0 331 183
in 0 331 183
the 0 331 183
seminary. 0 331 183

By 0 331 184
now 0 331 184
the 0 331 184
faithful 0 331 184
have 0 331 184
well 0 331 184
understood 0 331 184
Maradiaga’s 0 331 184
strategy: 0 331 184
insult 0 331 184
the 0 331 184
victims 0 331 184

up 0 331 184
a 0 331 184
chasm 0 331 184
of 0 331 184
abuses 0 331 184
of 0 331 184
power, 0 331 184
of 0 331 184

in 0 331 185
the 0 331 185

simply 0 331 185
been 0 331 185

the 0 331 191
Chilean 0 331 191
Bishops. 0 331 191

First 0 331 192
he 0 331 192
insulted 0 331 192
the 0 331 192
abuse 0 331 192
victims. 0 331 192

Then, 0 331 193
only 0 331 193
when 0 331 193
he 0 331 193
was 0 331 193
forced 0 331 193
by 0 331 193

by 0 331 193
the 0 331 193
Chilean 0 331 193
victims 0 331 193
and 0 331 193
faithful, 0 331 193
did 0 331 193
he 0 331 193
recognize 0 331 193
his 0 331 193
error 0 331 193
and 0 331 193
apologize, 0 331 193
while 0 331 193
stating 0 331 193
that 0 331 193
he 0 331 193
had 0 331 193
been 0 331 193
misinformed, 0 331 193
causing 0 331 193
a 0 331 193
disastrous 1 331 193

the 0 331 193

continuing 0 331 193
to 0 331 193
protect 0 331 193
the 0 331 193
two 0 331 193
Chilean 0 331 193
Cardinals 0 331 193
Errazuriz 0 331 193

Ezzati. 0 331 193

Even 0 331 194
in 0 331 194
the 0 331 194
tragic 0 331 194
affair 0 331 194
of 0 331 194
McCarrick, 0 331 194
Pope 0 331 194
Francis’s 0 331 194
behavior 0 331 194
was 0 331 194
no 0 331 194
different. 0 331 194

He 0 331 195
knew 0 331 195
from 0 331 195
at 0 331 195
least 0 331 195
June 0 331 195
23, 0 331 195
2013 0 331 195
that 0 331 195
McCarrick 0 331 195
was 0 331 195
a 0 331 195
serial 1 331 195
predator. 1 331 195

Although 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
knew 0 331 196
that 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
was 0 331 196
a 0 331 196
corrupt 0 331 196
man, 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
covered 0 331 196
for 0 331 196
him 0 331 196
to 0 331 196
the 0 331 196
bitter 0 331 196
end; 0 331 196
indeed, 0 331 196
he 0 331 196
made 0 331 196
McCarrick’s 0 331 196
advice 0 331 196
his 0 331 196
own, 0 331 196
which 0 331 196
was 0 331 196
certainly 0 331 196
not 0 331 196
inspired 0 331 196
by 0 331 196
sound 0 331 196
intentions 0 331 196
and 0 331 196
for 0 331 196
love 0 331 196
of 0 331 196
the 0 331 196
Church. 0 331 196

It 0 331 197
was 0 331 197
only 0 331 197
when 0 331 197
he 0 331 197
was 0 331 197
forced 0 331 197
by 0 331 197
the 0 331 197
report 0 331 197

a 0 331 197
minor, 0 331 197
again 0 331 197

the 0 331 197
basis 0 331 197
of 0 331 197
media 0 331 197
attention, 0 331 197
that 0 331 197
he 0 331 197
took 0 331 197
action 0 331 197
[regarding 0 331 197
McCarrick] 0 331 197
to 0 331 197

rising 0 331 198

from 0 331 198
the 0 331 198
lay 0 331 198

recently 0 331 198

several 0 331 198
bishops 0 331 198

McCarrick’s 0 331 198
criminal 0 331 198
behavior, 0 331 198

who 0 331 198
used 0 331 198
him 0 331 198
to 0 331 198

the 0 331 198

this 0 331 199
will 0 331 199

sin. 1 331 211

I 0 331 212
want 0 331 212
to 0 331 212
recall 0 331 212
this 0 331 212
indefectible 0 331 212
truth 0 331 212
of 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
Church’s 0 331 212
holiness 0 331 212
to 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
many 0 331 212
people 0 331 212
who 0 331 212
have 0 331 212
been 0 331 212
so 0 331 212
deeply 1 331 212
scandalized 1 331 212
by 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
abominable 1 331 212
and 0 331 212
sacrilegious 0 331 212
behavior 0 331 212
of 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
former 0 331 212
Archbishop 0 331 212
of 0 331 212
Washington, 0 331 212
Theodore 0 331 212
McCarrick; 0 331 212
by 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
grave, 0 331 212
disconcerting 0 331 212
and 0 331 212
sinful 1 331 212
conduct 0 331 212
of 0 331 212
Pope 0 331 212
Francis 0 331 212
and 0 331 212
by 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
conspiracy 0 331 212
of 0 331 212
silence 0 331 212
of 0 331 212
so 0 331 212
many 0 331 212
pastors, 0 331 212
and 0 331 212
who 0 331 212
are 0 331 212
tempted 0 331 212
to 0 331 212
abandon 0 331 212
the 0 331 212
Church, 0 331 212
disfigured 0 331 212
by 0 331 212
so 0 331 212
many 0 331 212
ignominies. 0 331 212

At 0 331 213
the 0 331 213
Angelus 0 331 213
on 0 331 213
Sunday, 0 331 213
August 0 331 213
12, 0 331 213
2018 0 331 213
Pope 0 331 213
Francis 0 331 213
said 0 331 213
these 0 331 213
words: 0 331 213
“Everyone 0 331 213
is 0 331 213
guilty 0 331 213
for 0 331 213
the 0 331 213
good 0 331 213
he 0 331 213
could 0 331 213
have 0 331 213
done 0 331 213
and 0 331 213
did 0 331 213
not 0 331 213
do 0 331 213
... 0 331 213

If 0 331 214
we 0 331 214
do 0 331 214
not 0 331 214
oppose 0 331 214
evil, 0 331 214
we 0 331 214
tacitly 0 331 214
feed 0 331 214
it. 0 331 214

We 0 331 215
need 0 331 215
to 0 331 215
intervene 0 331 215
where 0 331 215
evil 0 331 215
is 0 331 215
spreading; 0 331 215
for 0 331 215
evil 0 331 215
spreads 0 331 215
where 0 331 215
daring 0 331 215
Christians 0 331 215
who 0 331 215
oppose 0 331 215
evil 0 331 215
with 0 331 215
good 0 331 215
are 0 331 215
lacking.” 0 331 215
If 0 331 215
this 0 331 215
is 0 331 215
rightly 0 331 215
to 0 331 215
be 0 331 215
considered 0 331 215
a 0 331 215
serious 0 331 215

responsibility 0 331 215
for 0 331 215
every 0 331 215
believer, 0 331 215
how 0 331 215
much 0 331 215
graver 0 331 215
is 0 331 215
it 0 331 215
for 0 331 215
the 0 331 215
Church’s 0 331 215
supreme 0 331 215
pastor, 0 331 215
who 0 331 215
in 0 331 215
the 0 331 215
case 0 331 215
of 0 331 215
McCarrick 0 331 215
not 0 331 215
only 0 331 215
did 0 331 215
not 0 331 215
oppose 0 331 215
evil 0 331 215
but 0 331 215
associated 0 331 215
himself 0 331 215
in 0 331 215
doing 0 331 215
evil 0 331 215
with 0 331 215
someone 0 331 215
he 0 331 215
knew 0 331 215
to 0 331 215
be 0 331 215
deeply 0 331 215
corrupt. 0 331 215

He 0 331 216
followed 0 331 216
the 0 331 216
advice 0 331 216
of 0 331 216
someone 0 331 216
he 0 331 216
knew 0 331 216
well 0 331 216
to 0 331 216
be 0 331 216
a 0 331 216
pervert, 1 331 216
thus 0 331 216
multiplying 0 331 216
exponentially 0 331 216
with 0 331 216
his 0 331 216
supreme 0 331 216
authority 0 331 216
the 0 331 216
evil 0 331 216
done 0 331 216
by 0 331 216
McCarrick. 0 331 216

And 0 331 217
how 0 331 217
many 0 331 217

pastors 0 331 217

to 0 331 217
prop 0 331 217
up 0 331 217
in 0 331 217
their 0 331 217
active 0 331 217
destruction 0 331 217
of 0 331 217
the 0 331 217
Church! 0 331 217

Francis 0 331 218
is 0 331 218
abdicating 0 331 218
the 0 331 218
mandate 0 331 218
which 0 331 218
Christ 0 331 218
gave 0 331 218
to 0 331 218
Peter 0 331 218
to 0 331 218
confirm 0 331 218
the 0 331 218
brethren. 0 331 218

Indeed, 0 331 219
by 0 331 219
his 0 331 219
action 0 331 219
he 0 331 219
has 0 331 219
divided 0 331 219
them, 0 331 219
led 0 331 219
them 0 331 219
into 0 331 219
error, 0 331 219
and 0 331 219
encouraged 0 331 219
the 0 331 219
wolves 0 331 219
to 0 331 219
continue 0 331 219
to 0 331 219
tear 0 331 219
apart 0 331 219
the 0 331 219
sheep 0 331 219
of 0 331 219
Christ’s 0 331 219
flock. 0 331 219

In 0 331 220
this 0 331 220
extremely 0 331 220
dramatic 0 331 220
moment 0 331 220
for 0 331 220
the 0 331 220
universal 0 331 220
Church, 0 331 220
he 0 331 220
must 0 331 220
acknowledge 0 331 220
his 0 331 220
mistakes 0 331 220
and, 0 331 220
in 0 331 220
keeping 0 331 220
with 0 331 220
the 0 331 220
proclaimed 0 331 220
principle 0 331 220
of 0 331 220
zero 0 331 220
tolerance, 0 331 220
Pope 0 331 220
Francis 0 331 220
must 0 331 220
be 0 331 220
the 0 331 220
first 0 331 220
to 0 331 220
set 0 331 220
a 0 331 220
good 0 331 220
example 0 331 220
for 0 331 220
cardinals 0 331 220
and 0 331 220
bishops 0 331 220
who 0 331 220
covered 0 331 220
up 0 331 220
McCarrick’s 0 331 220
abuses 0 331 220
and 0 331 220
resign 0 331 220
along 0 331 220
with 0 331 220
all 0 331 220
of 0 331 220
them. 0 331 220

Even 0 331 221
in 0 331 221
dismay 0 331 221
and 0 331 221
sadness 0 331 221
over 0 331 221
the 0 331 221
enormity 0 331 221
of 0 331 221
what 0 331 221
is 0 331 221
happening, 0 331 221
let 0 331 221
us 0 331 221
not 0 331 221
lose 0 331 221
hope! 0 331 221

We 0 331 222
well 0 331 222
know 0 331 222
that 0 331 222
the 0 331 222
great 0 331 222
majority 0 331 222
of 0 331 222
our 0 331 222
pastors 0 331 222
live 0 331 222
their 0 331 222
priestly 0 331 222
vocation 0 331 222
with 0 331 222
fidelity 0 331 222
and 0 331 222
dedication. 0 331 222

It 0 331 223
is 0 331 223
in 0 331 223
moments 0 331 223
of 0 331 223
great 0 331 223
trial 0 331 223
that 0 331 223
the 0 331 223
Lord’s 0 331 223
grace 0 331 223
is 0 331 223
revealed 0 331 223
in 0 331 223
abundance 0 331 223
and 0 331 223
makes 0 331 223
His 0 331 223
limitless 0 331 223
mercy 0 331 223
available 0 331 223
to 0 331 223
all; 0 331 223
but 0 331 223
it 0 331 223
is 0 331 223
granted 0 331 223
only 0 331 223
to 0 331 223
those 0 331 223
who 0 331 223
are 0 331 223
truly 0 331 223
repentant 0 331 223
and 0 331 223
sincerely 0 331 223
propose 0 331 223
to 0 331 223
amend 0 331 223
their 0 331 223
lives. 0 331 223

This 0 331 224
is 0 331 224
a 0 331 224
favorable 0 331 224
time 0 331 224
for 0 331 224
the 0 331 224
Church 0 331 224
to 0 331 224
confess 0 331 224
her 0 331 224
sins, 0 331 224
to 0 331 224

and 0 331 224
to 0 331 224
do 0 331 224
penance. 0 331 224

Let 0 331 225
us 0 331 225
all 0 331 225
pray 0 331 225
for 0 331 225

for 0 331 225

let 0 331 225
us 0 331 225
remember 0 331 225
how 0 331 225
many 0 331 225
times 0 331 225
he 0 331 225
has 0 331 225

to 0 331 225

him! 0 331 225

WASHINGTON 0 5 1
— 0 5 1
President 0 5 1
Donald 0 5 1
Trump 0 5 1
formally 0 5 1
notified 0 5 1
Congress 0 5 1
on 0 5 1
Tuesday 0 5 1
that 0 5 1
deputy 0 5 1
CIA 0 5 1
director 0 5 1
Gina 0 5 1
Haspel 0 5 1
is 0 5 1
his 0 5 1
pick 0 5 1
to 0 5 1
lead 0 5 1
the 0 5 1
agency. 0 5 1

Trump 0 5 2
tweeted 0 5 2
last 0 5 2
month 0 5 2
that 0 5 2
he 0 5 2
had 0 5 2
selected 0 5 2
Haspel 0 5 2
to 0 5 2
replace 0 5 2
Mike 0 5 2
Pompeo, 0 5 2
who 0 5 2
is 0 5 2
being 0 5 2
considered 0 5 2
to 0 5 2
be 0 5 2
secretary 0 5 2
of 0 5 2
state. 0 5 2

But 0 5 3
the 0 5 3
president 0 5 3
had 0 5 3
not 0 5 3
sent 0 5 3
the 0 5 3
formal 0 5 3
paperwork 0 5 3
to 0 5 3
Capitol 0 5 3

including 0 5 4
an 0 5 4
FBI 0 5 4
background 0 5 4
check 0 5 4
that 0 5 4
took 0 5 4
longer 0 5 4
than 0 5 4
expected, 0 5 4
was 0 5 4
to 0 5 4
blame, 0 5 4
according 0 5 4
to 0 5 4
a 0 5 4
U.S. 0 5 4
official, 0 5 4
who 0 5 4
was 0 5 4
not 0 5 4
authorized 0 5 4
to 0 5 4
discuss 0 5 4
the 0 5 4
issue 0 5 4
and 0 5 4
spoke 0 5 4
only 0 5 4
on 0 5 4
condition 0 5 4
of 0 5 4
anonymity. 0 5 4

Still, 0 5 5
the 0 5 5
delay 0 5 5
prompted 0 5 5
critics 0 5 5
to 0 5 5
speculate 0 5 5
that 0 5 5
the 1 5 5
delay 1 5 5
signaled 1 5 5
the 1 5 5
White 1 5 5
House 1 5 5
was 1 5 5

Some 0 5 6
lawmakers 0 5 6
and 0 5 6
human 0 5 6
rights 0 5 6
groups 0 5 6
oppose 0 5 6
Haspel’s 0 5 6
nomination 0 5 6
because 0 5 6
of 0 5 6
her 0 5 6
role 0 5 6
in 0 5 6
the 0 5 6
CIA’s 0 5 6
detention 0 5 6

by 0 5 6

a 0 5 6

Kavanaugh 0 7 0
Nomination 0 7 0
Is 0 7 0
Exploding 1 7 0
in 1 7 0
Trump’s 1 7 0
Face 1 7 0

The 0 7 1
president 0 7 1
is 0 7 1
doubling 0 7 1
down 0 7 1
on 0 7 1
an 0 7 1
increasingly 0 7 1
risky 0 7 1
candidate. 0 7 1

Justice 0 7 2
Anthony 0 7 2
Kennedy 0 7 2
gave 0 7 2
President 0 7 2
Donald 0 7 2
Trump 0 7 2
the 1 7 2
biggest 1 7 2
political 1 7 2
gift 1 7 2
possible 1 7 2
when 0 7 2
he 0 7 2
announced 0 7 2
his 0 7 2
resignation 0 7 2
in 0 7 2
the 0 7 2
spring. 0 7 2

Even 0 7 3
though 0 7 3
not 0 7 3
everything 0 7 3
that’s 0 7 3
gone 0 7 3
wrong 0 7 3
is 0 7 3
Trump’s 0 7 3
fault, 0 7 3
he 0 7 3
has 0 7 3
managed 0 7 3
to 0 7 3
make 0 7 3
a 0 7 3
complete 1 7 3
hash 1 7 3
of 0 7 3
Brett 0 7 3
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 3
nomination 0 7 3
to 0 7 3
fill 0 7 3
the 0 7 3
empty 0 7 3
seat 0 7 3
on 0 7 3
the 0 7 3
court. 0 7 3

It’s 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
good 0 7 4
example 0 7 4
of 0 7 4
how 1 7 4
badly 1 7 4
Trump 1 7 4
does 1 7 4
his 1 7 4
job 1 7 4
more 0 7 4
than 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
year 0 7 4
and 0 7 4
a 0 7 4
half 0 7 4
into 0 7 4
his 0 7 4
administration. 0 7 4

To 0 7 5
begin 0 7 5
with, 0 7 5
Trump 0 7 5
has 0 7 5
outsourced 0 7 5
his 0 7 5
judicial 0 7 5
nominations 0 7 5
to 0 7 5
outside, 0 7 5
party-aligned 0 7 5
groups, 0 7 5
the 0 7 5
Heritage 0 7 5
Foundation 0 7 5
and 0 7 5
the 0 7 5
Federalist 0 7 5
Society. 0 7 5

That 0 7 6
included 0 7 6
an 0 7 6
unusually 0 7 6
central 0 7 6
role 0 7 6
for 0 7 6
the 0 7 6
Federalist 0 7 6
Society’s 0 7 6
Leonard 0 7 6
Leo. 0 7 6

That 0 7 7
wasn’t 0 7 7
entirely 0 7 7
a 0 7 7
Trump 0 7 7
mistake. 0 7 7

His 0 7 8
decision 0 7 8
during 0 7 8
the 0 7 8
campaign 0 7 8
to 0 7 8
release 0 7 8
a 0 7 8
list 0 7 8
of 0 7 8
potential 0 7 8
justices 0 7 8
drafted 0 7 8
by 0 7 8
Leo 0 7 8
reflected 1 7 8
the 1 7 8
reality-TV 1 7 8
star’s 1 7 8
weakness 1 7 8
as 1 7 8
a 1 7 8
presidential 1 7 8
candidate. 1 7 8

The 0 7 9
party 0 7 9
was 0 7 9
worried 0 7 9
that 0 7 9
Trump 0 7 9
might 0 7 9
turn 0 7 9
out 0 7 9
not 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
be 0 7 9
a 0 7 9
conservative; 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
reassure 0 7 9
them, 0 7 9
he 0 7 9
publicly 0 7 9
committed 0 7 9
to 0 7 9
their 0 7 9
top 0 7 9
goal. 0 7 9

In 0 7 10
some 0 7 10
ways, 0 7 10
that’s 0 7 10
successful 0 7 10
coalition-building, 0 7 10
and 0 7 10
what 0 7 10
he’s 0 7 10
done 0 7 10
in 0 7 10
office 0 7 10
is 0 7 10
just 0 7 10
keeping 0 7 10
his 0 7 10
promises 0 7 10
on 0 7 10
judges. 0 7 10

Still, 0 7 11
it’s 0 7 11
one 0 7 11
thing 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
form 0 7 11
an 0 7 11
alliance 0 7 11
with 0 7 11
conservatives; 0 7 11
it’s 0 7 11
another 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
turn 0 7 11
the 0 7 11
whole 0 7 11
process 0 7 11
over 0 7 11
to 0 7 11
them. 0 7 11

We 0 7 12
don’t 0 7 12
know 0 7 12
to 0 7 12
what 0 7 12
extent 0 7 12
Kavanaugh 0 7 12
was 0 7 12
Trump’s 0 7 12
choice 0 7 12
and 0 7 12
to 0 7 12
what 0 7 12
extent 0 7 12
he 0 7 12
was 0 7 12
manipulated 0 7 12
into 0 7 12
choosing 0 7 12
him. 0 7 12

We 0 7 13
have 0 7 13
plenty 0 7 13
of 0 7 13
evidence 0 7 13
that 0 7 13
Trump 1 7 13
is 1 7 13
easily 1 7 13
manipulated 1 7 13
by 1 7 13
those 1 7 13
around 1 7 13
him, 1 7 13
and 0 7 13
that 0 7 13
Kavanaugh 0 7 13
is 0 7 13
a 0 7 13
good 0 7 13
fit 0 7 13
for 0 7 13
Trump’s 0 7 13
biases: 0 7 13
The 0 7 13
judge 0 7 13
has 0 7 13
Ivy 0 7 13
League 0 7 13
credentials 0 7 13
and 0 7 13
he 0 7 13
passes 0 7 13
Trump’s 0 7 13
cut-of-his-jib 1 7 13
test 1 7 13
by 0 7 13
looking 0 7 13
the 0 7 13
part. 0 7 13

1 0 7 14

Either 0 7 15
way, 0 7 15
Kavanaugh 0 7 15
was 0 7 15
a 0 7 15
poor 0 7 15
choice 0 7 15
from 0 7 15
the 0 7 15
point 0 7 15
of 0 7 15
view 0 7 15
of 0 7 15
good 0 7 15
presidenting. 0 7 15

The 0 7 16
judge 0 7 16
was 0 7 16
certain 0 7 16
to 0 7 16
be 0 7 16
a 0 7 16
highly 0 7 16
controversial 0 7 16
selection 0 7 16
from 0 7 16
the 0 7 16
start. 0 7 16

After 0 7 17
all, 0 7 17
he 0 7 17
had 0 7 17
been 0 7 17
a 0 7 17
highly 0 7 17
controversial 0 7 17
selection 0 7 17
for 0 7 17
his 0 7 17
current 0 7 17
circuit 0 7 17
court 0 7 17
seat, 0 7 17
eventually 0 7 17
getting 0 7 17
confirmed 0 7 17
with 0 7 17
only 0 7 17
four 0 7 17
Democratic 0 7 17
votes 0 7 17
after 0 7 17
a 0 7 17
long 0 7 17
delay. 0 7 17

Kavanaugh 0 7 18
is 0 7 18
a 0 7 18
longtime 0 7 18
Republican 0 7 18
operative, 0 7 18
a 0 7 18
hard-liner 0 7 18
during 0 7 18
both 0 7 18
the 0 7 18
Vince 0 7 18
Foster 0 7 18
and 0 7 18
Monica 0 7 18
Lewinsky 0 7 18
investigations. 0 7 18

Nominating 0 7 19
him, 0 7 19
rather 0 7 19
than 0 7 19
a 0 7 19
conservative 0 7 19
with 0 7 19
similar 0 7 19
views 0 7 19
but 0 7 19
a 0 7 19
different 0 7 19
background, 0 7 19
was 0 7 19
bound 0 7 19
to 0 7 19
stir 0 7 19
up 0 7 19
trouble. 0 7 19

It 0 7 20
was 0 7 20
also 0 7 20
true, 0 7 20
as 0 7 20
Senate 0 7 20
Majority 0 7 20
Leader 0 7 20
Mitch 0 7 20
McConnell 0 7 20
reportedly 0 7 20
warned, 0 7 20
that 0 7 20
normal 0 7 20
disclosure 0 7 20
of 0 7 20
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 20
record, 0 7 20
especially 0 7 20
his 0 7 20
service 0 7 20
during 0 7 20
the 0 7 20
George 0 7 20
W. 0 7 20
Bush 0 7 20
administration, 0 7 20
was 0 7 20
going 0 7 20
to 0 7 20
delay 0 7 20
confirmation 0 7 20
even 0 7 20
more. 0 7 20

Senate 0 7 21
Republicans 0 7 21
dealt 0 7 21
with 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
problem 0 7 21
by 0 7 21
deciding 0 7 21
to 0 7 21
not 0 7 21
bother 0 7 21
with 0 7 21
any 0 7 21
Kavanaugh 0 7 21
documents 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
couldn’t 0 7 21
be 0 7 21
produced 0 7 21
rapidly, 0 7 21
which 0 7 21
further 0 7 21
riled 0 7 21
up 0 7 21
the 0 7 21
Democrats 0 7 21
and 0 7 21
gave 0 7 21
that 0 7 21
party 0 7 21
some 0 7 21
good 0 7 21
talking 0 7 21
points. 0 7 21

2 0 7 22

Sometimes 0 7 23
it’s 0 7 23
worth 0 7 23
taking 0 7 23

risks. 0 7 24
Presidents 0 7 24
who 0 7 24
shy 0 7 24
away 0 7 24
from 0 7 24
anything 0 7 24
that’s 0 7 24
not 0 7 24
a 0 7 24
sure 0 7 24
thing 0 7 24
can 0 7 24
fail 0 7 24
to 0 7 24
exploit 0 7 24
opportunities. 0 7 24

It’s 0 7 25
just 0 7 25
very 0 7 25
hard 0 7 25
to 0 7 25
see 0 7 25
any 0 7 25
upside 0 7 25
for 0 7 25
Trump 0 7 25
in 0 7 25
choosing 0 7 25
Kavanaugh 0 7 25
instead 0 7 25
of 0 7 25
a 0 7 25
safer, 0 7 25
but 0 7 25
still 0 7 25
very 0 7 25
conservative, 0 7 25
other 0 7 25
option. 0 7 25

3 0 7 26

When 0 7 27
serious 0 7 27
charges 0 7 27
of 0 7 27
sexual 0 7 27
misconduct 0 7 27
were 0 7 27
raised 0 7 27
against 0 7 27
Kavanaugh, 0 7 27
Trump 0 7 27
decided 0 7 27
to 0 7 27
stick 0 7 27
with 0 7 27
him 0 7 27
instead 0 7 27
of 0 7 27
moving 0 7 27
on 0 7 27
to 0 7 27
another 0 7 27
candidate. 0 7 27

It’s 0 7 28
still 0 7 28
not 0 7 28
clear 0 7 28
that 0 7 28
Kavanaugh’s 0 7 28
nomination 0 7 28
is 0 7 28
doomed, 0 7 28
but 0 7 28
it’s 0 7 28
certainly 0 7 28
in 0 7 28
severe 1 7 28
trouble. 1 7 28

Losing 0 7 29
a 0 7 29
high-profile 0 7 29
fight 0 7 29
is 0 7 29
always 0 7 29
going 0 7 29
to 0 7 29
hurt 0 7 29
a 0 7 29
president, 0 7 29
which 0 7 29
is 0 7 29
why 0 7 29
they 0 7 29
should 0 7 29
take 0 7 29
care 0 7 29
to 0 7 29
avoid 0 7 29
high-risk, 0 7 29
low-reward 0 7 29
conflicts. 0 7 29

But 0 7 30
there’s 0 7 30
an 0 7 30
art 0 7 30
to 0 7 30
minimizing 0 7 30

damage. 0 7 31
And 0 7 31
Trump 1 7 31
hasn’t 1 7 31
learned 1 7 31

it 1 7 32
yet. 1 7 32
For 0 7 32
one 0 7 32
thing, 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
president 0 7 32
has 0 7 32
made 0 7 32
this 0 7 32
an 0 7 32
extremely 1 7 32
high-profile 1 7 32
episode 1 7 32
by 0 7 32
stringing 0 7 32
out 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
process 0 7 32
as 0 7 32
the 0 7 32
accusations 0 7 32
against 0 7 32
Kavanaugh 0 7 32
gained 0 7 32
credibility 0 7 32
and 0 7 32
even 0 7 32
multiplied. 0 7 32

Whether 0 7 33
that 0 7 33
matters 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
terms 0 7 33
of 0 7 33
public 0 7 33
opinion 0 7 33
for 0 7 33
Trump 0 7 33
is 0 7 33
unclear, 0 7 33
but 0 7 33
it 0 7 33
certainly 0 7 33
isn’t 0 7 33
good 0 7 33
for 0 7 33
any 0 7 33
Republican 0 7 33
senators 0 7 33
caught 0 7 33
up 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
the 0 7 33
middle, 0 7 33
along 0 7 33
with 0 7 33
any 0 7 33
other 0 7 33
candidates 0 7 33
who 0 7 33
have 0 7 33
had 0 7 33
to 0 7 33
weigh 0 7 33
in 0 7 33
only 0 7 33
to 0 7 33
find 0 7 33
the 0 7 33
facts 0 7 33
as 0 7 33
they 0 7 33
knew 0 7 33
them 0 7 33
constantly 0 7 33
changing. 0 7 33

It’s 0 7 34
also 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
case 0 7 34
that 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
more 0 7 34
negative 0 7 34
information 0 7 34
comes 0 7 34
out, 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
more 0 7 34
it 0 7 34
appears 0 7 34
that 0 7 34
the 0 7 34
Trump 1 7 34
and 1 7 34
his 1 7 34
White 1 7 34
House 1 7 34
staff 1 7 34
failed 1 7 34
to 1 7 34
do 1 7 34
their 1 7 34
jobs 1 7 34
in 0 7 34
vetting 0 7 34
and 0 7 34
managing 0 7 34
Kavanaugh. 0 7 34

If 0 7 35
the 0 7 35
nomination 0 7 35
had 0 7 35
been 0 7 35
pulled 0 7 35
right 0 7 35
after 0 7 35
Christine 0 7 35
Blasey 0 7 35
Ford 0 7 35
made 0 7 35
her 0 7 35
initial 0 7 35
assertions 0 7 35
about 0 7 35
Kavanaugh, 0 7 35
the 0 7 35
public 0 7 35
might 0 7 35
have 0 7 35
concluded 0 7 35
that 0 7 35
it 0 7 35
wasn’t 0 7 35
Trump’s 0 7 35
fault 0 7 35
that 0 7 35
a 0 7 35
previously 0 7 35
unaired 0 7 35
accusation 0 7 35
came 0 7 35

to 0 7 36
light. 0 7 36
Meanwhile, 0 7 36
Trump’s 0 7 36
behavior 0 7 36
has 0 7 36
been 0 7 36
as 0 7 36
erratic 0 7 36

as 0 7 37
ever. 0 7 37
First 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
said 0 7 37
that 0 7 37
Brasey 0 7 37
had 0 7 37
to 0 7 37
be 0 7 37
heard; 0 7 37
then 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
attacked 0 7 37
her 0 7 37
in 0 7 37
terms 0 7 37
that 0 7 37
were 0 7 37
a 1 7 37
slur 1 7 37
on 1 7 37
all 1 7 37
women 1 7 37
who 0 7 37
have 0 7 37
been 0 7 37
assaulted 0 7 37
without 0 7 37
immediately 0 7 37
reporting 0 7 37
it 0 7 37
to 0 7 37
the 0 7 37
police, 0 7 37
and 0 7 37
he 0 7 37
also 0 7 37
blamed 0 7 37
the 0 7 37
Senate 0 7 37
for 0 7 37
not 0 7 37
voting 0 7 37
before 0 7 37
she 0 7 37
came 0 7 37

forward. 0 7 38
He 0 7 38
sometimes 0 7 38
praises 0 7 38
Kavanaugh, 0 7 38
but 0 7 38
also 0 7 38
let 0 7 38
it 0 7 38
be 0 7 38
known 0 7 38
that 0 7 38
he 0 7 38
thought 0 7 38
the 0 7 38
nominee 0 7 38
had 0 7 38
performed 0 7 38
badly 0 7 38
in 0 7 38
his 0 7 38
Fox 0 7 38
News 0 7 38

interview. 0 7 39
The 0 7 39
White 0 7 39
House 0 7 39
demanded 0 7 39
a 0 7 39
final 0 7 39
up 0 7 39
and 0 7 39
down 0 7 39
vote 0 7 39
on 0 7 39
Tuesday; 0 7 39
by 0 7 39
Wednesday, 0 7 39
he 0 7 39
was 0 7 39
saying 0 7 39
that 0 7 39
the 0 7 39
nomination 0 7 39
would 0 7 39
die 0 7 39
if 0 7 39
Kavanaugh 0 7 39
didn’t 0 7 39
do 0 7 39
well 0 7 39
before 0 7 39
the 0 7 39
Judiciary 0 7 39
Committee 0 7 39
on 0 7 39

Thursday. 0 7 40
The 0 7 40
sum 0 7 40
of 0 7 40
all 0 7 40
this 0 7 40
has 0 7 40
been, 0 7 40
as 0 7 40
in 0 7 40
many 0 7 40
other 0 7 40
episodes, 0 7 40
that 0 7 40
Trump 0 7 40
and 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
White 0 7 40
House 0 7 40
are 0 7 40
a 1 7 40
gang 1 7 40
that 1 7 40
can’t 1 7 40
shoot 1 7 40
straight 1 7 40
and 0 7 40
that 0 7 40
he’s 0 7 40
eager 0 7 40
to 0 7 40
blame 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
allies 0 7 40
and 0 7 40
lash 0 7 40
out 0 7 40
at 0 7 40
his 0 7 40
enemies 0 7 40
in 0 7 40
ugly 1 7 40
ways 1 7 40
when 0 7 40
things 0 7 40

go 0 7 41
wrong. 0 7 41
A 0 7 41
botched 0 7 41
nomination 0 7 41
matters 0 7 41
because 0 7 41
allies 0 7 41
will 0 7 41
be 0 7 41
less 0 7 41
likely 0 7 41
to 0 7 41
trust 0 7 41
Trump, 0 7 41
not 0 7 41
just 0 7 41
on 0 7 41
Supreme 0 7 41
Court 0 7 41
choices, 0 7 41
but 0 7 41
on 0 7 41
any 0 7 41

initiative. 0 7 42
And, 0 7 42
for 0 7 42
that 0 7 42
matter, 0 7 42
they’ll 0 7 42
be 0 7 42
less 0 7 42
likely 0 7 42
to 0 7 42
trust 0 7 42
him 0 7 42
when 0 7 42
he 0 7 42
asserts 0 7 42
that 0 7 42
there’s 0 7 42
nothing 0 7 42
remaining 0 7 42
for 0 7 42
Special 0 7 42
Counsel 0 7 42
Robert 0 7 42
Mueller 0 7 42

to 0 7 43
reveal. 0 7 43
Trump’s 0 7 43
professional 0 7 43
reputation 0 7 43
is 0 7 43
already 0 7 43
terrible, 0 7 43
but 0 7 43
everything 0 7 43

counts. 0 7 44
As 1 7 44
the 1 7 44
political 1 7 44
scientist 1 7 44
Richard 1 7 44
Neustadt 1 7 44
said, 1 7 44
political 1 7 44
elites 1 7 44
are 1 7 44
constantly 1 7 44
evaluating 1 7 44
and 1 7 44
re-evaluating 1 7 44
the 1 7 44

president. 1 7 45
Trump 0 7 45
is 0 7 45
hurting 0 7 45
himself 0 7 45
right 0 7 45
now, 0 7 45
and 0 7 45
will 0 7 45
have 0 7 45
hurt 0 7 45
himself 0 7 45
more 0 7 45
if 0 7 45
Kavanaugh 0 7 45
is 0 7 45
not 0 7 45

confirmed. 0 7 46
And 0 7 46
yes, 0 7 46
I 0 7 46
call 0 7 46
it 0 7 46
the 0 7 46
cut-of-his-jib 1 7 46
test 1 7 46
quite 0 7 46
deliberately. 0 7 46

It's 0 7 47
no 0 7 47
surprise 0 7 47
that 0 7 47
someone 1 7 47
who 1 7 47
hires 1 7 47
based 1 7 47
on 1 7 47
what 1 7 47
he 1 7 47
thinks 1 7 47
someone 1 7 47
doing 1 7 47
that 1 7 47
job 1 7 47
should 1 7 47
look 1 7 47
like, 1 7 47
which 0 7 47
seems 0 7 47
to 0 7 47
be 0 7 47
based 0 7 47
on 0 7 47
hazy 1 7 47
old-time 1 7 47
Hollywood 1 7 47
casting, 1 7 47
would 0 7 47
wind 0 7 47
up 0 7 47
with 0 7 47
fewer 0 7 47
women 0 7 47
in 0 7 47
his 0 7 47
administration 0 7 47
than 0 7 47
any 0 7 47
of 0 7 47
his 0 7 47
recent 0 7 47
predecessors. 0 7 47

I've 0 7 48
argued 0 7 48
that 0 7 48
too 0 7 48
much 0 7 48
disclosure 0 7 48
is 0 7 48
required, 0 7 48
and 0 7 48
that 0 7 48
Democrats 0 7 48
(and 0 7 48
any 0 7 48
wavering 0 7 48
Republicans) 0 7 48
had 0 7 48
more 0 7 48
than 0 7 48
enough 0 7 48
information 0 7 48
to 0 7 48
make 0 7 48
up 0 7 48

their 0 7 49
mind. 0 7 49
I 0 7 49
still 0 7 49
think 0 7 49

that's 0 7 50
true. 0 7 50
But 0 7 50
it 0 7 50
did 0 7 50
leave 0 7 50
Republicans 0 7 50
vulnerable 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
claims 0 7 50
about 0 7 50
transparency 0 7 50
which 0 7 50
were 0 7 50
likely 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
be 0 7 50
popular 0 7 50
-- 0 7 50
most 0 7 50
people, 0 7 50
and 0 7 50
the 0 7 50
entire 0 7 50
press 0 7 50
corps, 0 7 50
love 0 7 50
transparency 0 7 50
-- 0 7 50
and 0 7 50
vulnerable 0 7 50
to 0 7 50
bombshells 1 7 50
in 0 7 50
the 0 7 50
documentary 0 7 50
record 0 7 50
which 0 7 50
hadn't 0 7 50
been 0 7 50
initially 0 7 50

disclosed. 0 7 51
In 0 7 51
the 0 7 51
event, 0 7 51
that's 0 7 51
not 0 7 51
what's 0 7 51
causing 0 7 51
the 0 7 51
trouble, 0 7 51
but 0 7 51
still 0 7 51
it's 0 7 51
an 0 7 51
example 0 7 51
of 0 7 51
Trump 0 7 51
taking 0 7 51
needless 0 7 51

risks. 0 7 52
Some 0 7 52
have 0 7 52
speculated 0 7 52
that 0 7 52
Kavanaugh 0 7 52
would 0 7 52
be 0 7 52
especially 0 7 52
likely 0 7 52
to 0 7 52
rule 0 7 52
in 0 7 52
Trump's 0 7 52
favor 0 7 52
if 0 7 52
any 0 7 52
cases 0 7 52
stemming 0 7 52
from 0 7 52
the 0 7 52
Robert 0 7 52
Mueller 0 7 52
investigation 0 7 52
wind 0 7 52
up 0 7 52
at 0 7 52
the 0 7 52

high 0 7 53
court. 0 7 53

Perhaps. 0 7 54
There 0 7 54
are 0 7 54
plenty 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
other 0 7 54
partisan, 1 7 54
conservative 1 7 54
judges, 1 7 54
and 0 7 54
plenty 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
conservative 0 7 54
judges 0 7 54
who 0 7 54
lean 0 7 54
towards 0 7 54
an 0 7 54
expansive 0 7 54
view 0 7 54
of 0 7 54
presidential 0 7 54

powers. 0 7 55
And 0 7 55
if 0 7 55
Kavanaugh 0 7 55
is 0 7 55
really 0 7 55
an 0 7 55
outlier 0 7 55
on 0 7 55
that 0 7 55
issue, 0 7 55
then 0 7 55
he 0 7 55
won't 0 7 55
be 0 7 55
in 0 7 55
the 0 7 55
majority 0 7 55
on 0 7 55
any 0 7 55
future 0 7 55
decision 0 7 55

anyway. 0 7 55

So, 0 7 55

no, 0 7 55

I 0 7 55

don't 0 7 55

think 0 7 55

there's 0 7 55

any 0 7 55

good 0 7 55

reason 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

think 0 7 55

Kavanaugh 0 7 55

would 0 7 55

be 0 7 55

especially 0 7 55

helpful 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

Trump 0 7 55

compared 0 7 55

to 0 7 55

others 0 7 55

he 0 7 55

could 0 7 55

have 0 7 55

selected. 0 7 55

AAS. 0 27 6
Mr. 1 27 6
Ferrara, 1 27 6
however, 1 27 6
bases 1 27 6
his 1 27 6
critique 1 27 6
upon 1 27 6
an 1 27 6
assumption 1 27 6
that 1 27 6
the 1 27 6
“generous 1 27 6
response” 1 27 6
offered 1 27 6
to 1 27 6
God 1 27 6
is 1 27 6
a 1 27 6

sin. 1 27 7
This, 1 27 7
though, 1 27 7
is 1 27 7
not 1 27 7
what 1 27 7
AL 1 27 7
is 1 27 7
saying. 1 27 7

The 0 27 8
generous 0 27 8
response 0 27 8
is 0 27 8
a 0 27 8
move 0 27 8
away 0 27 8
from 0 27 8
sin 0 27 8
and 0 27 8
a 0 27 8
move 0 27 8
toward 0 27 8

God. 0 27 9
I 0 27 9

this 0 27 9

Prof. 0 27 11
Brugger 0 27 11
is 0 27 11
a 0 27 11
good 0 27 11
theologian 0 27 11
and 0 27 11
a 0 27 11
fine 0 27 11
man, 0 27 11
but 0 27 11
he 0 27 11
still 0 27 11
seems 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
believe 0 27 11
that 0 27 11
AL 0 27 11
303 0 27 11
implies 0 27 11
that 0 27 11
God 0 27 11
is 0 27 11
asking 0 27 11
people 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
continue 0 27 11
to 0 27 11
sin 0 27 11
in 0 27 11
some 0 27 11
cases. 0 27 11

In 0 27 12
his 0 27 12
April 0 27 12
22, 0 27 12
2016 0 27 12
article 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
Catholic 0 27 12
World 0 27 12
Report, 0 27 12
Brugger 0 27 12
writes 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
AL 0 27 12
303 0 27 12
suggests 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
“God 0 27 12
can 0 27 12
be 0 27 12
‘asking’ 0 27 12
someone 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
live 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
a 0 27 12
life-state 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
which 0 27 12
they 0 27 12
are 0 27 12
objectively 0 27 12
violating 0 27 12
grave 0 27 12
matter.” 0 27 12
Then 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
a 0 27 12
Sept. 0 27 12
28 0 27 12
‘17 0 27 12
LifeSiteNews 0 27 12
article, 0 27 12
he 0 27 12
states 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
“the 0 27 12
generous 0 27 12
response” 0 27 12
owed 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
God 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
“a 0 27 12
certain 0 27 12
state 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
objectively 0 27 12
at 0 27 12
variance 0 27 12
with 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
universal 0 27 12
command 0 27 12
of 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
Gospel.” 0 27 12
Now 0 27 12
Prof. 0 27 12
Brugger 0 27 12
argues 0 27 12
that, 0 27 12
because 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
subject 0 27 12
remains 0 27 12
“this 0 27 12
conscience” 0 27 12
in 0 27 12
AL 0 27 12
303, 0 27 12
this 0 27 12
proves 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
“generous 0 27 12
offering 0 27 12
owed 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
God” 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
recognition 0 27 12
that 0 27 12
one 0 27 12
is 0 27 12
living 0 27 12
“contrary 0 27 12
to 0 27 12
“the 0 27 12
universal 0 27 12
command 0 27 12
of 0 27 12
the 0 27 12
Gospel.” 0 27 12

Prof. 0 27 13
Brugger 0 27 13
fails 0 27 13
to 0 27 13
see 0 27 13
that 0 27 13
AL 0 27 13
303 0 27 13
clearly 0 27 13
distinguishes 0 27 13
between 0 27 13
a 0 27 13
conscience’s 0 27 13
recognition 0 27 13
that 0 27 13
“a 0 27 13
given 0 27 13
situation 0 27 13
is 0 27 13
objectively 0 27 13
at 0 27 13
variance 0 27 13
with 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
general 0 27 13
mandate 0 27 13
of 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
Gospel” 0 27 13
and 0 27 13
this 0 27 13
same 0 27 13
conscience’s 0 27 13
subsequent 0 27 13
recognition 0 27 13
of 0 27 13
a 0 27 13
“generous 0 27 13
response 0 27 13
owed 0 27 13
to 0 27 13
God 0 27 13
in 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
present 0 27 13
circumstances.” 0 27 13
The 0 27 13
subject 0 27 13
“conscience” 0 27 13
might 0 27 13
be 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
same 0 27 13
but 0 27 13
the 0 27 13
object 0 27 13
is 0 27 13
different. 0 27 13

The 0 27 14
“generous 0 27 14
response” 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
not 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
situation 0 27 14
that 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
at 0 27 14
variance 0 27 14
with 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
command 0 27 14
of 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
Gospel 0 27 14
but 0 27 14
an 0 27 14
offering 0 27 14
that 0 27 14
God 0 27 14
is 0 27 14
asking 0 27 14
amid 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
mass 0 27 14
of 0 27 14
impediments 0 27 14
even 0 27 14
though 0 27 14
it 0 27 14
may 0 27 14
not 0 27 14
yet 0 27 14
be 0 27 14
the 0 27 14
perfect 0 27 14
objective 0 27 14

model. 0 27 15
What 0 27 15
might 0 27 15
be 0 27 15
this 0 27 15
“generous 0 27 15
response?” 0 27 15
Pope 0 27 15
Francis 0 27 15
does 0 27 15
not 0 27 15
give 0 27 15
an 0 27 15
example 0 27 15
in 0 27 15
AL 0 27 15
303 0 27 15
because 0 27 15
he’s 0 27 15
speaking 0 27 15
in 0 27 15
general 0 27 15
terms 0 27 15
of 0 27 15
the 0 27 15
dynamics 0 27 15
of 0 27 15
conscience. 0 27 15

Moreover, 0 27 16
he 0 27 16
knows 0 27 16
that 0 27 16
concrete 0 27 16
cases 0 27 16
vary 0 27 16

widely. 0 27 17
In 0 27 17
our 0 27 17
Sept. 0 27 17
26 0 27 17
article 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
La 0 27 17
Stampa, 0 27 17
Dr. 0 27 17
Goldstein 0 27 17
and 0 27 17
I 0 27 17
provided 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
hypothetical 0 27 17
example 0 27 17
of 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
couple 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
a 0 27 17
purely 0 27 17
civil 0 27 17
“marriage” 0 27 17
recognizing 0 27 17
that 0 27 17
God 0 27 17
is 0 27 17
calling 0 27 17
them 0 27 17
to 0 27 17
live 0 27 17
in 0 27 17
continence. 0 27 17

We 0 27 18
chose 0 27 18
this 0 27 18
example 0 27 18
deliberately 0 27 18
to 0 27 18
demonstrate 0 27 18
that 0 27 18
“the 0 27 18
generous 0 27 18
response” 0 27 18
could 0 27 18
be 0 27 18
the 0 27 18
ending 0 27 18
of 0 27 18
a 0 27 18
particular 0 27 18

sin. 0 27 19
Our 0 27 19
example 0 27 19
was 0 27 19
an 0 27 19
attempt 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
show 0 27 19
that 0 27 19
Professors 0 27 19
Brugger 0 27 19
and 0 27 19
Seifert 0 27 19
are 0 27 19
wrong 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
believe 0 27 19
AL 0 27 19
303 0 27 19
implies 0 27 19
that 0 27 19
God 0 27 19
is 0 27 19
asking 0 27 19
some 0 27 19
people 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
continue 0 27 19
to 0 27 19
live 0 27 19
in 0 27 19
an 0 27 19
objectively 0 27 19
sinful 0 27 19

state. 0 27 20
It’s 0 27 20
really 0 27 20
just 0 27 20
the 0 27 20
opposite. 0 27 20

AL 0 27 21
303 0 27 21
teaches 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
conscience 0 27 21
will 0 27 21
come 0 27 21
to 0 27 21
recognize 0 27 21
that 0 27 21
God 0 27 21
is 0 27 21
asking 0 27 21
for 0 27 21
a 0 27 21
step 0 27 21
in 0 27 21
the 0 27 21
right 0 27 21
direction 0 27 21
away 0 27 21
from 0 27 21

sin. 0 27 22
Pope 1 27 22
Francis 1 27 22
explains 1 27 22
this 1 27 22
again 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
AL 1 27 22
305 1 27 22
when 1 27 22
he 1 27 22
says 1 27 22
“a 1 27 22
small 1 27 22
step, 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
the 1 27 22
midst 1 27 22
of 1 27 22
great 1 27 22
human 1 27 22
limitations, 1 27 22
can 1 27 22
be 1 27 22
more 1 27 22
pleasing 1 27 22
to 1 27 22
God 1 27 22
than 1 27 22
a 1 27 22
life 1 27 22
which 1 27 22
appears 1 27 22
outwardly 1 27 22
in 1 27 22
order, 1 27 22
but 0 27 22
moves 0 27 22
through 0 27 22
the 0 27 22
day 0 27 22
without 0 27 22
confronting 0 27 22
great 0 27 22
difficulties.’” 0 27 22

In 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
recent 0 27 23
interview 0 27 23
(http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
Italian 0 27 23
philosopher, 0 27 23
Rocco 0 27 23
Buttiglione, 0 27 23
provides 0 27 23
this 0 27 23
example 0 27 23
for 0 27 23
AL 0 27 23
303: 0 27 23
“Imagine 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
father 0 27 23
who 0 27 23
has 0 27 23
a 0 27 23
sick 0 27 23
son 0 27 23
and 0 27 23
the 0 27 23
child 0 27 23
improves. 0 27 23

He 0 27 24
still 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
fever 0 27 24
but 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
stopped 0 27 24
vomiting; 0 27 24
the 0 27 24
child 0 27 24
manages 0 27 24
to 0 27 24
keep 0 27 24
in 0 27 24
his 0 27 24
stomach 0 27 24
what 0 27 24
he 0 27 24
eats 0 27 24
and 0 27 24
has 0 27 24
started 0 27 24
a 0 27 24
therapy 0 27 24
that 0 27 24
seems 0 27 24

to 0 27 25
work. 0 27 25
The 0 27 25
father 0 27 25
is 0 27 25

happy. 0 27 26
Is 0 27 26
he 0 27 26
happy 0 27 26
about 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
fact 0 27 26
that 0 27 26
the 0 27 26
child 0 27 26

is 0 27 27
sick? 0 27 27
No, 0 27 27
he 0 27 27
is 0 27 27
pleased 0 27 27
that 0 27 27
his 0 27 27
son 0 27 27
gives 0 27 27
symptoms 0 27 27
of 0 27 27
improvement 0 27 27
and 0 27 27
healing.” 0 27 27

This 0 27 28
is 0 27 28
what 0 27 28
Pope 0 27 28
Francis 0 27 28
is 0 27 28
saying 0 27 28
in 0 27 28

AL 0 27 29
303. 0 27 29
God 0 27 29
is 0 27 29
not 0 27 29
happy 0 27 29
with 0 27 29
situations 0 27 29
that 0 27 29
are 0 27 29
objectively 0 27 29
at 0 27 29
variance 0 27 29
with 0 27 29
the 0 27 29
command 0 27 29
of 0 27 29
the 0 27 29

Gospel. 0 27 30
God, 0 27 30
however, 0 27 30
is 0 27 30
happy 0 27 30
when 0 27 30
people 0 27 30
in 0 27 30
such 0 27 30
situations 0 27 30
discern 0 27 30
in 0 27 30
conscience 0 27 30
that 0 27 30
He 0 27 30
is 0 27 30
asking 0 27 30
them 0 27 30
to 0 27 30
make 0 27 30
a 0 27 30
choice 0 27 30
that 0 27 30
moves 0 27 30
in 0 27 30
the 0 27 30
right 0 27 30
direction—even 0 27 30
if 0 27 30
they 0 27 30
still 0 27 30
need 0 27 30
to 0 27 30
progress 0 27 30
further 0 27 30
toward 0 27 30
a 0 27 30
more 0 27 30
complete 0 27 30
fulfillment 0 27 30
of 0 27 30

His 0 27 31
will. 0 27 31
This 0 27 31
is 0 27 31
the 0 27 31
law 0 27 31
of 0 27 31
gradualness 0 27 31
not 0 27 31
the 0 27 31
gradualness 0 27 31
of 0 27 31

the 0 27 32
law. 0 27 32
It 0 27 32
is 0 27 32
sad 0 27 32
that 0 27 32
this 0 27 32

compassionate 0 27 32
message 0 27 32
of 0 27 32

so 0 27 32
completely 0 27 32
misunderstood 0 27 32
by 0 27 32

I 0 27 35
certainly 0 27 35
do 0 27 35

agree 0 27 35
that 0 27 35

With 1 27 37
all 1 27 37
due 1 27 37
respect 1 27 37
to 1 27 37
Dr. 1 27 37
Fastiggi, 1 27 37
his 1 27 37
argument 1 27 37
and 1 27 37
that 1 27 37
of 1 27 37

a 1 27 37
“move 1 27 37
away 1 27 37
from 1 27 37

what 1 27 37

not 1 27 37
adhered 1 27 37
to, 1 27 37
is 1 27 37

sophistical. 1 27 38
What 0 27 38
constitutes 0 27 38
a 0 27 38
“move 0 27 38

from 0 27 38
sin 0 27 38
if 0 27 38
not 0 27 38
ceasing 0 27 38

commit 0 27 38

the 0 27 39
sin? 0 27 39
No 0 27 39
example 0 27 39
is 0 27 39
provided 0 27 39
in 0 27 39
AL 0 27 39
because 0 27 39

none 0 27 40
can 0 27 40
be. 0 27 40
The 0 27 40
notion 0 27 40
is 0 27 40

nonsensical. 0 27 41
Just 0 27 41
how 0 27 41
nonsensical 0 27 41
is 0 27 41
demonstrated 0 27 41
by 0 27 41
Dr. 0 27 41
Fastiggi’s 0 27 41
claim 0 27 41
that 0 27 41
by 0 27 41
“a 0 27 41
move 0 27 41
away 0 27 41
from 0 27 41
sin” 0 27 41
in 0 27 41
the 0 27 41
case 0 27 41
of 0 27 41
a 0 27 41
divorced 0 27 41
and 0 27 41
“remarried” 0 27 41
couple 0 27 41
Francis 0 27 41
means 0 27 41
their 0 27 41
agreement 0 27 41
to 0 27 41
live 0 27 41
in 0 27 41
continence 0 27 41
as 0 27 41
brother 0 27 41
and 0 27 41
sister 0 27 41
for 0 27 41
the 0 27 41
sake 0 27 41

of 0 27 42
children. 0 27 42
But 0 27 42
that 0 27 42
would 0 27 42
be 0 27 42
ceasing 0 27 42
to 0 27 42
commit 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
sin 0 27 42
of 0 27 42
adultery 0 27 42
altogether 0 27 42
as 0 27 42
it 0 27 42
would 0 27 42
involve 0 27 42
abandoning 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
pretense 0 27 42
that 0 27 42
they 0 27 42
are 0 27 42
married 0 27 42
along 0 27 42
with 0 27 42
the 0 27 42
illicit 0 27 42
sexual 0 27 42
relation 0 27 42

itself. 0 27 43
Such 0 27 43
a 0 27 43
couple 0 27 43
could 0 27 43
always 0 27 43
be 0 27 43
absolved 0 27 43
and 0 27 43
receive 0 27 43
Holy 0 27 43
Communion 0 27 43
under 0 27 43
the 0 27 43
Church’s 0 27 43
constant 0 27 43
practice, 0 27 43
albeit 0 27 43
privately 0 27 43
to 0 27 43
avoid 0 27 43

scandal. 0 27 44
At 0 27 44
any 0 27 44
rate, 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
“brother 0 27 44
and 0 27 44
sister” 0 27 44
approach 0 27 44
to 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
situation, 0 27 44
which 0 27 44
is 0 27 44
that 0 27 44
of 0 27 44
Familiaris 0 27 44
consortio 0 27 44
84, 0 27 44
is 0 27 44
certainly 0 27 44
not 0 27 44
the 0 27 44
one 0 27 44
advocated 0 27 44

by 0 27 45
Francis. 0 27 45
As 0 27 45
my 0 27 45
article 0 27 45
shows, 0 27 45
Francis 0 27 45
has 0 27 45
made 0 27 45
it 0 27 45
quite 0 27 45
clear 0 27 45
that 0 27 45
he 0 27 45
approves 0 27 45
of 0 27 45
admitting 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
the 0 27 45
sacraments 0 27 45
divorced 0 27 45
and 0 27 45
“remarried” 0 27 45
people 0 27 45
who 0 27 45
will 0 27 45
continue 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
live 0 27 45
as 0 27 45
if 0 27 45
they 0 27 45
were 0 27 45
married, 0 27 45
including 0 27 45
sexual 0 27 45
relations, 0 27 45
while 0 27 45
“discerning” 0 27 45
their 0 27 45
situation, 0 27 45
this 0 27 45
“discernment” 0 27 45
being 0 27 45
a 0 27 45
mere 0 27 45
fig 0 27 45
leaf 0 27 45
to 0 27 45
conceal 0 27 45
the 0 27 45
proposed 0 27 45
toleration 0 27 45
of 0 27 45
public 0 27 45
adultery 0 27 45
in 0 27 45

the 0 27 46
Church. 0 27 46
Thus, 0 27 46
Francis 0 27 46
thanked 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
Maltese 0 27 46
bishops 0 27 46
for 0 27 46
their 0 27 46
AL 0 27 46
guidelines, 0 27 46
which 0 27 46
literally 0 27 46
mandate 0 27 46
admission 0 27 46
to 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
sacraments 0 27 46
of 0 27 46
divorced 0 27 46
and 0 27 46
“remarried” 0 27 46
people 0 27 46
who 0 27 46
believe 0 27 46
themselves 0 27 46
to 0 27 46
be 0 27 46
“at 0 27 46
peace 0 27 46
with 0 27 46
God.” 0 27 46
And, 0 27 46
as 0 27 46
he 0 27 46
told 0 27 46
the 0 27 46
bishops 0 27 46
of 0 27 46

orthodox 1 27 63

In 0 27 64
fact 0 27 64
the 0 27 64
statement 0 27 64
of 0 27 64

Argentine 0 27 64

only 0 27 64
speaks 0 27 64
of 0 27 64

This 0 27 64
could 0 27 64
reasonably 0 27 64
be 0 27 64
interpreted 0 27 64
as 0 27 64
going 0 27 64

before 0 27 64

receiving 0 27 65

both 1 27 67
Italian 1 27 67

English, 1 27 67
and 1 27 67
I 1 27 67
only 1 27 67
find 1 27 67
mention 1 27 67
of 1 27 67

Once 0 27 68
again, 0 27 68
Mr. 0 27 68
Ferrara 0 27 68

access 0 27 68

Holy 0 27 68

the 0 27 69
Bishops 0 27 69
of 0 27 69
Malta, 0 27 69
it 0 27 69
should 0 27 69
be 0 27 69
noted 0 27 69
that 0 27 69
Edward 0 27 69
Pentin 0 27 69

a 0 27 69
letter 0 27 69

Cardinal 0 27 69
Baldiserri 0 27 69

Moreover, 0 27 70
this 0 27 70
letter 0 27 70
has 0 27 70
not 0 27 70
been 0 27 70
made 0 27 70
public 0 27 70
so 0 27 70
we 0 27 70
don't 0 27 70
know 0 27 70
exactly 0 27 70
what 0 27 70
it 0 27 70

other 0 27 70

an 0 27 71
expression 0 27 71
of 0 27 71

This 0 27 71
seems 0 27 71
to 0 27 71
be 0 27 71
very 0 27 71
thin 0 27 71
evidence 0 27 71

As 0 27 72
a 0 27 72
lawyer, 0 27 72
Ferrara 0 27 72
should 0 27 72
have 0 27 72
a 0 27 72
better 0 27 72
sense 0 27 72
of 0 27 72
what 0 27 72

really 0 27 73
counts 0 27 73
as 0 27 73
evidence. 0 27 73
As 0 27 73
a 0 27 73
Christian, 0 27 73
he 0 27 73
should 0 27 73
also 0 27 73
be 0 27 73

of 0 27 73
the 0 27 73
command 0 27 73
against 0 27 73

bearing 0 27 74
false 0 27 74
witness. 0 27 74
Beyond 0 27 74
these 0 27 74
considerations, 0 27 74
I 0 27 74
wish 0 27 74
to 0 27 74
express 0 27 74
a 0 27 74
personal 0 27 74
concern 0 27 74
I 0 27 74
have 0 27 74
about 0 27 74
Mr. 0 27 74
Ferrara's 0 27 74
standing 0 27 74

in 0 27 75
the 0 27 75
Catholic 0 27 75
Church. 0 27 75
He 0 27 75
says 0 27 75
that 0 27 75
Dr. 0 27 75
Goldstein 0 27 75
and 0 27 75
I 0 27 75
are 0 27 75
“foot 1 27 75
soldiers 1 27 75
of 1 27 75
a 1 27 75
Leviathan 1 27 75
Church” 1 27 75
because 0 27 75
we 0 27 75

defend 0 27 76
the 0 27 76
Roman 0 27 76
Pontiff. 0 27 76
Does 1 27 76
Mr. 1 27 76
Ferrara 1 27 76
believe 1 27 76
that 1 27 76
the 1 27 76
Catholic 1 27 76
Church 1 27 76
under 1 27 76
Pope 1 27 76
Francis 1 27 76
is 1 27 76
a 1 27 76
“Leviathan 1 27 76
Church” 1 27 76
and 1 27 76

not 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
Catholic 1 27 77
Church? 1 27 77
If 1 27 77
this 1 27 77
is 1 27 77
so, 1 27 77
then 1 27 77
it 1 27 77
would 1 27 77
suggest 1 27 77
that 1 27 77
Mr. 1 27 77
Ferrara 1 27 77
is 1 27 77
refusing 1 27 77
submission 1 27 77
to 1 27 77
the 1 27 77
Roman 1 27 77

Church 1 27 78
subject 1 27 78
to 1 27 78
him. 1 27 78
This, 0 27 78
though, 0 27 78
is 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
very 0 27 78
definition 0 27 78
of 0 27 78
schism 0 27 78
found 0 27 78
in 0 27 78
the 0 27 78
Catechism 0 27 78
of 0 27 78

Catholic 0 27 78
Church, 0 27 78

and 0 27 79

I 0 27 79
hope 0 27 79
Mr. 0 27 79
Ferrara 0 27 79
can 0 27 79
clarify 0 27 79
what 0 27 79
he 0 27 79
means 0 27 79
by 0 27 79
the 0 27 79
“Leviathan 0 27 79

Church” 0 27 80
under 0 27 80
Pope 0 27 80
Francis. 0 27 80
A 0 27 80
more 0 27 80
simple 0 27 80
question 0 27 80
to 0 27 80
him 0 27 80
would 0 27 80
be 0 27 80
this: 0 27 80
“Are 0 27 80
you 0 27 80
refusing 0 27 80
submission 0 27 80
to 0 27 80
the 0 27 80
Roman 0 27 80
Pontiff 0 27 80
or 0 27 80
communion 0 27 80
with 0 27 80
the 0 27 80

members 0 27 81
subject 0 27 81
to 0 27 81
him?” 0 27 81
I 0 27 81
apologize 0 27 81
ahead 0 27 81
of 0 27 81
time 0 27 81

if 0 27 82
I 0 27 82
misconstrued 0 27 82
his 0 27 82
words. 0 27 82
I 0 27 82
believe, 0 27 82
though, 0 27 82
my 0 27 82
question 0 27 82
is 0 27 82
reasonable 0 27 82
in 0 27 82
light 0 27 82
of 0 27 82
his 0 27 82
reference 0 27 82
to 0 27 82
a 0 27 82
“Leviathan 0 27 82
Church” 0 27 82
distinct 0 27 82
from 0 27 82
“the 0 27 82

a 0 27 84

not 0 27 84

literal-mindedness. 1 27 86
To 0 27 86

it 0 27 86
clear 0 27 86
for 0 27 86
him, 0 27 86
I 0 27 86
am 0 27 86
contending 0 27 86
that 0 27 86
he 0 27 86
and 0 27 86
his 0 27 86
co-author 0 27 86
treat 0 27 86

do 0 27 87
not, 0 27 87
as 0 27 87
should 0 27 87
be 0 27 87
obvious, 0 27 87
argue 0 27 87
that 0 27 87
this 0 27 87

objections 0 27 90
to 0 27 90

Jeff 0 29 3
begins 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
interview 0 29 3
by 0 29 3
making 0 29 3
clear 0 29 3
his 0 29 3
belief 0 29 3
that 0 29 3
there 0 29 3
were 0 29 3
multiple 0 29 3
active 0 29 3
shooters 0 29 3
targeting 0 29 3
different 0 29 3
places 0 29 3
in 0 29 3

on 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
night 0 29 3
of 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
attack. 0 29 3

“First 0 29 4
of 0 29 4
all, 0 29 4
I 0 29 4
think 0 29 4
what 0 29 4
needs 0 29 4
to 0 29 4
be 0 29 4
said 0 29 4
is 0 29 4
that, 0 29 4
from 0 29 4
my 0 29 4
perspective, 0 29 4
there 0 29 4
were 0 29 4
multiple 0 29 4
events 0 29 4
that 0 29 4
occurred 0 29 4
around 0 29 4
Las 0 29 4
Vegas, 0 29 4
up 0 29 4
and 0 29 4
down 0 29 4
the 0 29 4
Strip 0 29 4
that 0 29 4
night. 0 29 4

It 0 29 5
wasn’t 0 29 5
just 0 29 5
centralized 0 29 5
around 0 29 5
the 0 29 5
Mandalay 0 29 5
Hotel,” 0 29 5
the 0 29 5
witness 0 29 5
claimed. 0 29 5

The 0 29 6
eyewitness 0 29 6
then 0 29 6
goes 0 29 6
on 0 29 6
to 0 29 6
directly 0 29 6
say 0 29 6
that 0 29 6
he 0 29 6
and 0 29 6
his 0 29 6
wife 0 29 6
were 0 29 6
involved 0 29 6
in 0 29 6
an 0 29 6
active 0 29 6
shooter 0 29 6
situation 0 29 6
at 0 29 6
a 0 29 6
different 0 29 6
hotel 0 29 6
that 0 29 6
authorities 0 29 6
have 0 29 6
so 0 29 6
far 0 29 6
done 0 29 6
everything 0 29 6
in 0 29 6
their 0 29 6
power 0 29 6
to 0 29 6
cover-up. 0 29 6

“My 0 29 7
wife 0 29 7
and 0 29 7
I 0 29 7
were 0 29 7
in 0 29 7
Las 0 29 7

celebrating 0 29 7
our 0 29 7
10th 0 29 7
anniversary 0 29 7
and 0 29 7
on 0 29 7
October 0 29 7
1st 0 29 7
we 0 29 7
were 0 29 7
involved 0 29 7
in 0 29 7
an 0 29 7
incident 0 29 7
with 0 29 7
an 0 29 7
active 0 29 7
shooter 0 29 7
at 0 29 7
the 0 29 7
Bellagio. 0 29 7

There 0 29 8
is 0 29 8
no 0 29 8
mistake 0 29 8
in 0 29 8
my 0 29 8
mind 0 29 8
about 0 29 8
it,” 0 29 8
he 0 29 8
continued. 0 29 8

Jeff 0 29 9
then 0 29 9
describes 0 29 9
a 0 29 9
scene 0 29 9
in 0 29 9
which 0 29 9
he 0 29 9
and 0 29 9
his 0 29 9
wife 0 29 9
were 0 29 9
walking 0 29 9
through 0 29 9
the 0 29 9
main 0 29 9
lobby 0 29 9
when 0 29 9
screams 0 29 9
and 0 29 9
gunfire 0 29 9
erupted. 0 29 9

Keep 1 29 10
in 1 29 10
mind, 1 29 10
this 1 29 10
is 1 29 10
all 1 29 10
information 1 29 10
that 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
police 1 29 10
and 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
FBI 1 29 10
has 1 29 10
hidden 1 29 10
from 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
American 1 29 10
people. 1 29 10

“All 0 29 11
of 0 29 11
a 0 29 11
sudden 0 29 11
there 0 29 11
was 0 29 11
just 0 29 11
a 0 29 11
crescendo 0 29 11
of 0 29 11
screams 0 29 11
that 0 29 11
started 0 29 11
behind 0 29 11
us 0 29 11
in 0 29 11
the 0 29 11
lobby,” 0 29 11
he 0 29 11
claimed. 0 29 11

“Then 0 29 12
I 0 29 12
heard 0 29 12
somebody 0 29 12
yell 0 29 12
‘there’s 0 29 12
a 0 29 12
shooter! 0 29 12

There’s 0 29 13
a 0 29 13
shooter!’ 0 29 13
And 0 29 13
then 0 29 13
I 0 29 13
heard 0 29 13
like 0 29 13
five 0 29 13
or 0 29 13
six 0 29 13
pops, 0 29 13
like 0 29 13
unmistakable 0 29 13
gunfire, 0 29 13
unmistakably.” 0 29 13

“That 0 29 14
was 0 29 14
about 0 29 14
11:20 0 29 14
when 0 29 14
we 0 29 14
heard 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
shots 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
screams… 0 29 14
at 0 29 14
that 0 29 14
point 0 29 14
you 0 29 14
could 0 29 14
hear 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
see 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
screams 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
see 0 29 14
hundreds 0 29 14
of 0 29 14
people 0 29 14
coming 0 29 14
towards 0 29 14
us.” 0 29 14

Amazingly, 0 29 15

This 0 29 16

surely 1 29 17
we 0 29 17
are 0 29 17
starting 0 29 17

At 0 29 18
this 0 29 18
point 0 29 18
it 1 29 18
is 1 29 18
strikingly 1 29 18
obvious 1 29 18
that 1 29 18

the 0 32 2

is 0 32 2
formally 0 32 2
known. 0 32 2

The 0 32 3
JCPOA’s 0 32 3
fundamental 0 32 3
flaws 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
President 0 32 3
Trump 0 32 3
wants 0 32 3
fixed 0 32 3
include 0 32 3
Iran’s 0 32 3
ability 0 32 3
to 0 32 3
block 0 32 3
unfettered 0 32 3
international 0 32 3
inspections, 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
wiggle 0 32 3
room 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
Iran 0 32 3
is 0 32 3
exploiting 0 32 3
to 0 32 3
continue 0 32 3
developing 0 32 3
and 0 32 3
testing 0 32 3
ballistic 0 32 3
missiles 0 32 3
capable 0 32 3
of 0 32 3
delivering 0 32 3
nuclear 0 32 3

and 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
sunset 0 32 3
clause 0 32 3
on 0 32 3
nuclear 0 32 3
enrichment 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
would 0 32 3
provide 0 32 3

a 0 32 3
clear 0 32 3
path 0 32 3
to 0 32 3
becoming 0 32 3
a 0 32 3
nuclear 0 32 3
armed 0 32 3
state 0 32 3
after 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
current 0 32 3
restrictions 0 32 3
are 0 32 3
lifted. 0 32 3

Obama 0 32 4
and 0 32 4
Kerry 0 32 4
had 0 32 4
promised 0 32 4
that 0 32 4
these 0 32 4
issues 0 32 4
would 0 32 4
be 0 32 4
dealt 0 32 4
with 0 32 4
satisfactorily 0 32 4
before 0 32 4
agreeing 0 32 4
to 0 32 4
the 0 32 4
final 0 32 4
terms 0 32 4
of 0 32 4
the 0 32 4
JCPOA. 0 32 4

Instead 0 32 5
they 0 32 5
caved 0 32 5
to 0 32 5
Iranian 0 32 5
pressure 0 32 5
in 0 32 5
order 0 32 5
to 0 32 5
get 0 32 5
the 0 32 5
deal 0 32 5
done. 0 32 5

Now 0 32 6
that 0 32 6
President 0 32 6
Trump 0 32 6
is 0 32 6
trying 1 32 6
to 1 32 6
clean 1 32 6
up 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
mess 1 32 6
Obama 0 32 6
and 0 32 6
Kerry 0 32 6
left 0 32 6
him, 0 32 6
Kerry 0 32 6
has 0 32 6
the 0 32 6
gall 0 32 6
to 0 32 6
label 0 32 6
President 0 32 6
Trump’s 0 32 6
decision 0 32 6
a 0 32 6
"reckless 1 32 6
abandonment 1 32 6
of 1 32 6
facts 1 32 6
in 1 32 6
favor 1 32 6
of 1 32 6
ego 1 32 6
and 1 32 6
ideology" 1 32 6
and 0 32 6
to 0 32 6
accuse 0 32 6
the 0 32 6
Trump 0 32 6
administration 0 32 6
of 0 32 6
“lying 1 32 6
to 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
American 1 32 6
people.” 1 32 6
It 1 32 6
was 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
Obama 1 32 6
administration 1 32 6
that 1 32 6
recklessly 1 32 6
abandoned 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
facts 1 32 6
in 1 32 6
pressing 1 32 6
ahead 1 32 6
with 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
deal. 1 32 6

The 1 32 7
Obama 1 32 7
administration 1 32 7
lied 1 32 7
to 1 32 7
the 1 32 7
American 1 32 7
people, 1 32 7
abandoning 0 32 7
its 0 32 7
own 0 32 7
promises 0 32 7
to 0 32 7
ensure 0 32 7
that 0 32 7
the 0 32 7
deal 0 32 7
contained 0 32 7
ironclad 0 32 7
protections. 0 32 7

Moreover, 0 32 8
all 0 32 8
that 0 32 8
President 0 32 8
Trump 0 32 8
has 0 32 8
done 0 32 8
so 0 32 8
far 0 32 8
is 0 32 8
to 0 32 8
return 0 32 8
the 0 32 8
JCPOA 0 32 8
to 0 32 8
Congress 0 32 8
for 0 32 8
review. 0 32 8

Had 0 32 9
Obama 0 32 9
followed 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
Constitution 0 32 9
and 0 32 9
submitted 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
JCPOA 0 32 9
to 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
Senate 0 32 9
as 0 32 9
a 0 32 9
treaty 0 32 9
in 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
first 0 32 9
place, 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
JCPOA 0 32 9
in 0 32 9
its 0 32 9
present 0 32 9
form 0 32 9
almost 0 32 9
certainly 0 32 9
would 0 32 9
not 0 32 9
have 0 32 9
been 0 32 9
approved. 0 32 9

Congress 0 32 10
should 0 32 10
now 0 32 10
have 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
opportunity 0 32 10
to 0 32 10
revisit 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
JCPOA 0 32 10
to 0 32 10
determine 0 32 10
whether 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
protections 0 32 10
that 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
Obama 0 32 10
administration 0 32 10
promised 0 32 10
are 0 32 10
working 0 32 10
as 0 32 10
advertised. 0 32 10

Congress 0 32 11
should 0 32 11
also 0 32 11
consider 0 32 11
whether 0 32 11
time 0 32 11
limits 0 32 11
on 0 32 11
Iran’s 0 32 11
commitments 0 32 11
continue 0 32 11
to 0 32 11
make 0 32 11
sense 0 32 11
in 0 32 11
light 0 32 11
of 0 32 11
what 0 32 11
we 0 32 11
are 0 32 11
now 0 32 11
experiencing 0 32 11
with 0 32 11
Iran’s 0 32 11
nuclear 0 32 11
technology 0 32 11
collaborator, 0 32 11
North 0 32 11
Korea. 0 32 11

It 0 32 12
bought 0 32 12
time 0 32 12
to 0 32 12
turn 0 32 12
into 0 32 12
a 0 32 12
full-fledged 0 32 12
nuclear 0 32 12
power 0 32 12
under 0 32 12
our 0 32 12
noses. 0 32 12

Kerry 0 32 13
had 0 32 13
promised 0 32 13
that 0 32 13
the 0 32 13
Iranian 0 32 13
regime 0 32 13
would 0 32 13
be 0 32 13
prohibited 0 32 13
from 0 32 13
testing 0 32 13
ballistic 0 32 13
missiles. 0 32 13

This 0 32 14
turned 0 32 14
out 0 32 14
to 0 32 14
be 0 32 14
a 0 32 14
lie. 0 32 14

After 0 32 15
the 0 32 15
JCPOA 0 32 15
was 0 32 15
finalized, 0 32 15
with 0 32 15
no 0 32 15
such 0 32 15
prohibition 0 32 15
included, 0 32 15
Iran 0 32 15
continued 0 32 15
to 0 32 15
test 0 32 15
such 0 32 15
missiles. 0 32 15

The 0 32 16
Obama 0 32 16
administration’s 0 32 16
response 0 32 16
was 0 32 16
that 0 32 16
the 0 32 16
missiles 0 32 16
had 0 32 16
become 0 32 16
a 0 32 16
separate 0 32 16
issue, 0 32 16
to 0 32 16
be 0 32 16
dealt 0 32 16
with 0 32 16
under 0 32 16
a 0 32 16
new 0 32 16
United 0 32 16

Security 0 32 16
Council 0 32 16
resolution 0 32 16
endorsing 0 32 16
the 0 32 16
JCPOA. 0 32 16

The 0 32 17
new 0 32 17
resolution 0 32 17
replaced 0 32 17
clear 0 32 17
prohibitions 0 32 17
imposed 0 32 17
on 0 32 17
Iran’s 0 32 17
ballistic 0 32 17
missile 0 32 17
program 0 32 17
with 0 32 17
a 0 32 17
weak 0 32 17
declaration 0 32 17
in 0 32 17
an 0 32 17
annex 0 32 17
that 0 32 17
simply 0 32 17
“calls 0 32 17
upon” 0 32 17
Iran 0 32 17
not 0 32 17
to 0 32 17
undertake 0 32 17
any 0 32 17
activity 0 32 17
such 0 32 17

to 0 32 17

capable 0 32 17
of 0 32 17
delivering 0 32 17
nuclear 0 32 17
weapons 0 32 17
for 0 32 17
eight 0 32 17
years. 0 32 17

Iran 0 32 18
has 0 32 18
tested 0 32 18
several 0 32 18
ballistic 0 32 18
missiles 0 32 18
during 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
last 0 32 18
two 0 32 18
years, 0 32 18
including 0 32 18
two 0 32 18
Qadr 0 32 18
H 0 32 18
missiles 0 32 18
with 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
phrase 0 32 18
“Israel 1 32 18
must 1 32 18
be 1 32 18
wiped 1 32 18
out” 1 32 18
emblazoned 0 32 18
on 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
sides. 0 32 18

The 0 32 19
commander 0 32 19
of 0 32 19
Iran’s 0 32 19
Army, 0 32 19
Major 0 32 19
General 0 32 19
Ataollah 0 32 19
Salehi, 0 32 19
had 0 32 19
told 0 32 19
reporters 0 32 19
just 0 32 19
a 0 32 19
month 0 32 19
before 0 32 19
the 0 32 19
launch 0 32 19
of 0 32 19
those 0 32 19
missiles 0 32 19
that 0 32 19
Iran 0 32 19
was 0 32 19
"neither 0 32 19
paying 0 32 19

nor 0 32 19
implementing 0 32 19
them. 0 32 19

This 0 32 20
is 0 32 20
not 0 32 20
a 0 32 20
breach 0 32 20
of 0 32 20
the 0 32 20

Vitaly 0 32 21

under 0 32 21
the 0 32 21

that 0 32 21
the 0 32 21
Iranian 0 32 21
missile 0 32 21
test 0 32 21
did 0 32 21
not 0 32 21
violate 0 32 21
the 0 32 21
resolution. 0 32 21

“A 0 32 22

the 0 32 22

In 0 32 23
short, 0 32 23
the 0 32 23
JCPOA 0 32 23
did 0 32 23
not 0 32 23

did 0 32 23
mention 0 32 23
the 0 32 23

toothless. 0 32 23

Deputy 0 32 24
National 0 32 24
Security 0 32 24
Advisor 0 32 24
Ben 0 32 24
Rhodes 0 32 24
told 0 32 24
CNN, 0 32 24
during 0 32 24
an 0 32 24
interview 0 32 24
aired 0 32 24
on 0 32 24
April 0 32 24
6, 0 32 24
2015, 0 32 24
that 0 32 24
under 0 32 24
the 0 32 24
deal’s 0 32 24
terms 0 32 24
then 0 32 24
still 0 32 24
being 0 32 24
negotiated, 0 32 24
“you 0 32 24
will 0 32 24
have 0 32 24
anywhere, 0 32 24
anytime, 0 32 24
24/7 0 32 24
access 0 32 24
as 0 32 24
it 0 32 24
relates 0 32 24
to 0 32 24
the 0 32 24
nuclear 0 32 24
facilities 0 32 24
that 0 32 24
Iran 0 32 24
has." 0 32 24

Rhodes 0 32 25
claimed 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
“if 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
see 0 32 25
a 0 32 25
site 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
need 0 32 25
to 0 32 25
inspect 0 32 25
on 0 32 25
a 0 32 25
military 0 32 25
facility, 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
can 0 32 25
get 0 32 25
access 0 32 25
to 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
site 0 32 25
and 0 32 25
inspect 0 32 25
it. 0 32 25

So 0 32 26
if 0 32 26
it's 0 32 26
a 0 32 26
suspicious 0 32 26
site 0 32 26
that 0 32 26
we 0 32 26
believe 0 32 26
is 0 32 26
related 0 32 26
to 0 32 26
its 0 32 26
nuclear 0 32 26
efforts, 0 32 26
we 0 32 26
can 0 32 26
get 0 32 26
access 0 32 26
and 0 32 26
inspect 0 32 26
that 0 32 26
site 0 32 26
through 0 32 26
the 0 32 26
IAEA.” 0 32 26
This 1 32 26
was 1 32 26
another 1 32 26
lie. 1 32 26

After 0 32 27
the 0 32 27
JCPOA 0 32 27
was 0 32 27
finalized 0 32 27
in 0 32 27
July 0 32 27
2015, 0 32 27
Rhodes 0 32 27
shamelessly 1 32 27
denied 1 32 27
that 0 32 27
anytime, 0 32 27
anywhere 0 32 27
inspections 0 32 27
were 0 32 27
ever 0 32 27
considered 0 32 27
as 0 32 27
part 0 32 27
of 0 32 27
the 0 32 27
negotiations. 0 32 27

“We 0 32 28
never 0 32 28
sought 0 32 28
in 0 32 28
this 0 32 28
negotiation 0 32 28
the 0 32 28
capacity 0 32 28
for 0 32 28
so-called 0 32 28
anytime, 0 32 28
anywhere,” 0 32 28
Rhodes 0 32 28
said 0 32 28
on 0 32 28
July 0 32 28
14, 0 32 28
2015. 0 32 28

The 0 32 29
JCPOA’s 0 32 29
supporters, 0 32 29
including 0 32 29
Kerry, 0 32 29
have 0 32 29
made 0 32 29
much 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
fact 0 32 29
that 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
International 0 32 29
Atomic 0 32 29
Energy 0 32 29
Agency 0 32 29
(IAEA) 0 32 29
has 0 32 29
on 0 32 29
several 0 32 29
occasions 0 32 29
verified 0 32 29
Iran’s 0 32 29
compliance 0 32 29
with 0 32 29
its 0 32 29
commitments 0 32 29
under 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
JCPOA, 0 32 29
keeping 0 32 29
its 0 32 29
stock 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
low-enriched 0 32 29
uranium 0 32 29
below 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
limit 0 32 29
set 0 32 29
forth 0 32 29
in 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
JCPOA 0 32 29
and 0 32 29
not 0 32 29
pursuing 0 32 29
further 0 32 29
construction 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
Arak 0 32 29
reactor. 0 32 29

Iran 0 32 30
was 0 32 30
found 0 32 30
to 0 32 30
have 0 32 30
slightly 0 32 30
exceeded 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
limit 0 32 30
on 0 32 30
its 0 32 30
stock 0 32 30
of 0 32 30
heavy 0 32 30
water, 0 32 30
but 0 32 30
has 0 32 30
remedied 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
problem 0 32 30
to 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
IAEA’s 0 32 30
satisfaction. 0 32 30

IAEA 0 32 31
chief 0 32 31
Yukiya 0 32 31
Amano 0 32 31
reiterated 0 32 31
in 0 32 31
a 0 32 31
statement 0 32 31
he 0 32 31
issued 0 32 31
on 0 32 31
October 0 32 31
9th 0 32 31
that 0 32 31
Iran 0 32 31
has 0 32 31
remained 0 32 31
in 0 32 31
compliance 0 32 31
with 0 32 31
its 0 32 31
JCPOA 0 32 31
commitments. 0 32 31

The 0 32 32
problem, 0 32 32
as 0 32 32
any 0 32 32
clear-eyed 0 32 32
observer 0 32 32
of 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
process 0 32 32
recognizes, 0 32 32
is 0 32 32
that 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
IAEA 0 32 32
relies 0 32 32
on 0 32 32
Iran 0 32 32
for 0 32 32
self-inspection 0 32 32
of 0 32 32
certain 0 32 32
sites 0 32 32
that 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
regime 0 32 32
does 0 32 32
not 0 32 32
want 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
IAEA 0 32 32
to 0 32 32
inspect 0 32 32
freely 0 32 32
on 0 32 32
its 0 32 32
own. 0 32 32

IAEA 0 32 33
inspectors 0 32 33
have 0 32 33
avoided 0 32 33
examining 0 32 33
military 0 32 33
sites 0 32 33
it 0 32 33
knows 0 32 33
exists 0 32 33
and 0 32 33
has 0 32 33
no 0 32 33
reliable 0 32 33
way 0 32 33
of 0 32 33
tracking 0 32 33
undeclared 0 32 33
sites. 0 32 33

The 0 32 34
IAEA’s 0 32 34
explanation 0 32 34
for 0 32 34
not 0 32 34
visiting 0 32 34
any 0 32 34
of 0 32 34
Iran’s 0 32 34
known 0 32 34
military 0 32 34
sites 0 32 34
is 0 32 34
that 0 32 34
it 0 32 34
had 0 32 34
“no 0 32 34
reason 0 32 34
to 0 32 34
ask” 0 32 34
for 0 32 34
access. 0 32 34

Evidently, 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
IAEA 0 32 35
is 0 32 35
supposed 0 32 35
to 0 32 35
block 0 32 35
out 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
fact 0 32 35
that 0 32 35
Iran 0 32 35
had 0 32 35
conducted 0 32 35
tests 0 32 35
relevant 0 32 35
to 0 32 35
nuclear 0 32 35
bomb 0 32 35
detonations 0 32 35
at 0 32 35
a 0 32 35
military 0 32 35
site 0 32 35
before 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
JCPOA’s 0 32 35
finalization 0 32 35
in 0 32 35
2015. 0 32 35

The 0 32 36
IAEA 0 32 36
should 0 32 36
just 0 32 36
pretend 0 32 36
that 0 32 36
such 0 32 36
tests 0 32 36
could 0 32 36
not 0 32 36
possibly 0 32 36
happen 0 32 36
again. 0 32 36

“Nobody 0 32 37
is 0 32 37
allowed 0 32 37
to 0 32 37
visit 0 32 37
Iran's 0 32 37
military 0 32 37
sites,” 0 32 37
said 0 32 37
Iran’s 0 32 37
Head 0 32 37
of 0 32 37
Strategic 0 32 37
Research 0 32 37
Center 0 32 37
at 0 32 37
the 0 32 37
Expediency 0 32 37
Council 0 32 37
and 0 32 37
adviser 0 32 37
to 0 32 37
Supreme 0 32 37
Leader 0 32 37
Ayatollah 0 32 37
Khamenei, 0 32 37
Ali 0 32 37
Akbar 0 32 37
Velayati. 0 32 37

Intimidation 0 32 38
works. 0 32 38

The 0 32 39
IAEA 0 32 39
knows 0 32 39
not 0 32 39
to 0 32 39
ask. 0 32 39

As 0 32 40
to 0 32 40
the 0 32 40
JCPOA’s 0 32 40
sunset 0 32 40
provisions, 0 32 40
the 0 32 40
Obama 1 32 40
administration 1 32 40
lied 1 32 40
about 1 32 40
that 1 32 40
too. 1 32 40

Kerry 0 32 41
claimed 0 32 41
on 0 32 41
September 0 32 41
2, 0 32 41
2015 0 32 41
that 0 32 41
the 0 32 41
JCPOA 0 32 41
“never 0 32 41
sunsets. 0 32 41

There’s 0 32 42
no 0 32 42
sunset 0 32 42
in 0 32 42
this 0 32 42
agreement.” 0 32 42

This 0 32 43
month 0 32 43
Kerry 0 32 43
has 0 32 43
resorted 0 32 43
to 0 32 43
parsing 0 32 43
words. 0 32 43

He 0 32 44
claims 0 32 44
the 0 32 44
phrase 0 32 44
'sunset 0 32 44
provisions' 0 32 44
is 0 32 44
a 0 32 44
“misnomer,” 0 32 44
before 0 32 44
then 0 32 44
defending 0 32 44
the 0 32 44
JCPOA’s 0 32 44
time 0 32 44
limits. 0 32 44

"We 0 32 45
were 0 32 45
comfortable 0 32 45
because 0 32 45
the 0 32 45
cap 0 32 45
on 0 32 45
Iran’s 0 32 45
low-enriched 0 32 45
uranium 0 32 45
stockpile 0 32 45
remains 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
place 0 32 45
until 0 32 45
2030,” 0 32 45
Kerry 0 32 45
wrote 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
an 0 32 45
article 0 32 45
published 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
the 0 32 45
Washington 0 32 45
Post 0 32 45
late 0 32 45
last 0 32 45
month. 0 32 45

In 0 32 46
other 0 32 46
words, 0 32 46
let’s 1 32 46
just 1 32 46
kick 1 32 46
the 1 32 46
can 1 32 46
down 1 32 46
the 1 32 46
road 1 32 46
and 0 32 46
hope 0 32 46
for 0 32 46
a 0 32 46
more 0 32 46
reasonable 0 32 46
Iranian 0 32 46
regime 0 32 46
in 0 32 46
13 0 32 46
years 0 32 46
that 0 32 46
would 0 32 46
agree 0 32 46
to 0 32 46
extend 0 32 46
the 0 32 46
time 0 32 46
limits. 0 32 46

In 0 32 47
the 0 32 47
meantime, 0 32 47
Kerry 0 32 47
advises 0 32 47
us 0 32 47
not 0 32 47
to 0 32 47
worry. 0 32 47

Kerry 0 32 48
declared, 0 32 48
“15 0 32 48
or 0 32 48
25 0 32 48
years 0 32 48
from 0 32 48
now, 0 32 48
we 0 32 48
still 0 32 48
have 0 32 48
the 0 32 48
same 0 32 48
military 0 32 48
options 0 32 48
we 0 32 48
have 0 32 48
today.” 0 32 48

John 0 32 49
Kerry 0 32 49
has 0 32 49
obviously 0 32 49
learned 0 32 49
nothing 0 32 49
from 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korean 0 32 49
fiasco, 1 32 49
which 0 32 49
resulted 0 32 49
from 0 32 49
years 0 32 49
of 0 32 49
phony 1 32 49
agreements 1 32 49
with 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
rogue 0 32 49
regime 0 32 49
and 0 32 49
so-called 0 32 49
“strategic 0 32 49
patience.” 0 32 49
The 0 32 49
United 0 32 49
States 0 32 49
clearly 0 32 49
does 0 32 49
not 0 32 49
have 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
same 0 32 49
military 0 32 49
options 0 32 49
today 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
deal 0 32 49
with 0 32 49
a 0 32 49
nuclear 0 32 49
armed 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korea 0 32 49
as 0 32 49
it 0 32 49
did 0 32 49
23 0 32 49
years 0 32 49
ago 0 32 49
when 0 32 49
former 0 32 49
President 0 32 49
Bill 0 32 49
Clinton 0 32 49
decided 0 32 49
not 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
use 0 32 49
military 0 32 49
force 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
stamp 0 32 49
out 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korea’s 0 32 49
nuclear 0 32 49
program 0 32 49
at 0 32 49
its 0 32 49
inception. 0 32 49

Instead, 0 32 50
Clinton 0 32 50
started 0 32 50
us 0 32 50
down 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
primrose 0 32 50
path 0 32 50
of 0 32 50
naïve 0 32 50
diplomacy 0 32 50
with 0 32 50
a 0 32 50
duplicitous 0 32 50
regime 0 32 50
that 0 32 50
now 0 32 50
is 0 32 50
on 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
verge 0 32 50
of 0 32 50
being 0 32 50
able 0 32 50
to 0 32 50
strike 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
U.S. 0 32 50
mainland 0 32 50
with 0 32 50
nuclear 0 32 50
warheads 0 32 50
delivered 0 32 50
by 0 32 50
intercontinental 0 32 50
ballistic 0 32 50
missiles. 0 32 50

It 0 32 51
is 0 32 51
precisely 0 32 51
because 0 32 51
North 1 32 51
Korea’s 1 32 51
actions 1 32 51
over 1 32 51
the 1 32 51
last 1 32 51
23 1 32 51
years 1 32 51
have 1 32 51
proven 1 32 51
that 1 32 51
making 1 32 51
concessions 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
a 1 32 51
rogue 1 32 51
regime 1 32 51
in 1 32 51
order 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
obtain 1 32 51
denuclearization 1 32 51
commitments 1 32 51
is 1 32 51
so 1 32 51
dangerous 1 32 51
that 1 32 51
President 1 32 51
Trump 1 32 51
does 1 32 51
not 1 32 51
want 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
make 1 32 51
the 1 32 51
same 1 32 51
mistake 1 32 51
with 1 32 51
Iran. 1 32 51

America’s 0 32 52
European 0 32 52
allies 0 32 52
are 0 32 52
also 0 32 52
upset 0 32 52
with 0 32 52
President 0 32 52
Trump 0 32 52
for 0 32 52
refusing 0 32 52
to 0 32 52
recertify 0 32 52
the 0 32 52
deal 0 32 52

a 0 32 53
joint 0 32 53
statement 0 32 53
last 0 32 53
Friday 0 32 53
praising 0 32 53
the 0 32 53
JCPOA 0 32 53
and 0 32 53
its 0 32 53
implementation. 0 32 53

They 0 32 54
said 0 32 54
that 0 32 54
the 0 32 54
nuclear 0 32 54
deal 0 32 54
with 0 32 54
Iran 0 32 54
was 0 32 54
“the 0 32 54
culmination 0 32 54
of 0 32 54
13 0 32 54
years 0 32 54
of 0 32 54
diplomacy 0 32 54
and 0 32 54
was 0 32 54
a 0 32 54
major 0 32 54
step 0 32 54
towards 0 32 54
ensuring 0 32 54
that 0 32 54
Iran’s 0 32 54
nuclear 0 32 54
programme 0 32 54
is 0 32 54
not 0 32 54
diverted 0 32 54
for 0 32 54
military 0 32 54
purposes. 0 32 54

Therefore, 0 32 55
we 0 32 55
encourage 0 32 55
the 1 32 55
US 1 32 55
Administration 1 32 55
and 1 32 55
Congress 1 32 55
to 1 32 55
consider 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
implications 1 32 55
to 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
security 1 32 55
of 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
US 1 32 55
and 1 32 55
its 1 32 55
allies 1 32 55
before 1 32 55
taking 1 32 55
any 1 32 55
steps 1 32 55
that 1 32 55
might 1 32 55
undermine 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
JCPOA, 1 32 55
such 1 32 55
as 1 32 55
re-imposing 1 32 55
sanctions 1 32 55
on 1 32 55
Iran 1 32 55
lifted 1 32 55
under 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
agreement.” 1 32 55

Perhaps 0 32 56
these 0 32 56
European 0 32 56
leaders 0 32 56
should 0 32 56
remember 0 32 56

its 0 37 4
aggressive 0 37 4
actions 0 37 4
in 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
region 0 37 4
is 0 37 4
not 0 37 4
a 0 37 4
restoration 0 37 4
of 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
sanctions 0 37 4
lifted 0 37 4
by 0 37 4
the 0 37 4
Obama 0 37 4

its 0 37 4

nuclear 0 37 4

If 0 37 5
Iran 0 37 5
insists 0 37 5
it 0 37 5
can 0 37 5
do 0 37 5
what 0 37 5
it 0 37 5
wants 0 37 5
militarily 0 37 5
in 0 37 5

transfers 0 37 5
without 0 37 5
violating 0 37 5
the 0 37 5
nuclear 0 37 5
deal, 0 37 5
then 0 37 5
the 0 37 5
United 0 37 5

can 0 37 5
certainly 0 37 5
act 0 37 5
to 0 37 5
curb 0 37 5
such 0 37 5
activities 0 37 5
through 0 37 5
financial 0 37 5
pressure. 0 37 5

The 0 37 6
U.S. 0 37 6
can 0 37 6
impose 0 37 6
sanctions 0 37 6
against 0 37 6
the 0 37 6
Iranian 0 37 6
regime’s 0 37 6
principal 0 37 6
instrument 0 37 6
for 0 37 6
projecting 0 37 6

The 0 37 7
Iranian 0 37 7
regime 0 37 7
does 0 37 7
not 0 37 7
see 0 37 7
it 0 37 7
that 0 37 7
way, 0 37 7
however. 0 37 7

With 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
lifting 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
nuclear-related 0 37 8
sanctions 0 37 8

billions 0 37 8

to 0 37 8
Iran’s 0 37 8
leaders 0 37 8

further 0 37 8
finance 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
IRGC’s 0 37 8
exploits 0 37 8
in 0 37 8
Iraq, 0 37 8
Syria, 0 37 8
Lebanon, 0 37 8
Yemen 0 37 8
and 0 37 8
elsewhere, 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
regime 0 37 8
is 0 37 8
furious 0 37 8
that 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
Trump 0 37 8
administration 0 37 8
is 0 37 8
tightening 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
financial 0 37 8
screws 0 37 8
again, 0 37 8
even 0 37 8
if 0 37 8
for 0 37 8
reasons 0 37 8
not 0 37 8
directly 0 37 8
related 0 37 8
to 0 37 8
Iran’s 0 37 8
compliance 0 37 8

the 0 37 8
terms 0 37 8
of 0 37 8
the 0 37 8
nuclear 0 37 8
deal. 0 37 8

Thus, 1 37 9
it 1 37 9
is 1 37 9
threatening 1 37 9
U.S. 1 37 9
forces 1 37 9
and 1 37 9

for 1 37 10
more 1 37 10

place 1 37 10

in 1 37 10
harm’s 1 37 10
way. 1 37 10

senior 0 37 11

officials, 0 37 11
including 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
defense 0 37 11
minister 0 37 11
and 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
chief 0 37 11
of 0 37 11
staff 0 37 11
of 0 37 11
the 0 37 11
Syrian 0 37 11
armed 0 37 11
forces. 0 37 11

Bagheri 0 37 12
is 0 37 12
quoted 0 37 12
as 0 37 12
saying 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
his 0 37 12
visit’s 0 37 12
purpose 0 37 12
was 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
“put 0 37 12
a 0 37 12
joint 0 37 12
strategy 0 37 12
on 0 37 12
continuing 0 37 12
co-ordination 0 37 12
and 0 37 12
co-operation 0 37 12
at 0 37 12
the 0 37 12
military 0 37 12
level.” 0 37 12
Some 0 37 12
experts 0 37 12
on 0 37 12
Iran 0 37 12
believe 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
Bagheri’s 0 37 12
visit 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
Damascus 0 37 12
at 0 37 12
this 0 37 12
time 0 37 12
is 0 37 12
intended 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
reinforce 0 37 12
a 0 37 12
message 0 37 12
that 0 37 12
Iran 0 37 12
will 0 37 12
continue 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
supply 0 37 12
weaponry 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
Syria 0 37 12
and 0 37 12
to 0 37 12
reinforce 0 37 12
the 0 37 12
presence 0 37 12
of 0 37 12
its 0 37 12
terrorist 0 37 12
proxy 0 37 12
Hezbollah 0 37 12
in 0 37 12
Syria. 0 37 12

This 1 37 13
will 1 37 13
not 1 37 13
only 1 37 13
serve 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
bolster 1 37 13
the 1 37 13
Assad 1 37 13
regime, 1 37 13
but 1 37 13
it 1 37 13
also 1 37 13
will 1 37 13
strengthen 1 37 13
Iran's 1 37 13
ability 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
follow 1 37 13
through 1 37 13
on 1 37 13
its 1 37 13
threats 1 37 13
to 1 37 13
the 1 37 13
U.S. 1 37 13
and 1 37 13
its 1 37 13
allies, 1 37 13
principally 1 37 13
Israel. 1 37 13

Meanwhile, 0 37 14
following 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
departure 0 37 14
of 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
Kurds 0 37 14
from 0 37 14
Kirkuk, 0 37 14
Iraq 0 37 14
earlier 0 37 14
this 0 37 14
week, 0 37 14
the 0 37 14
IRGC’s 0 37 14
operational 0 37 14
Al 0 37 14
Qods 0 37 14
arm 0 37 14
reportedly 0 37 14
established 0 37 14
a 0 37 14

center 0 37 14
and 0 37 14
five 0 37 14
bases 0 37 14
there. 0 37 14

According 0 37 15
to 0 37 15
Debkafile, 0 37 15
this 0 37 15
constitutes 0 37 15
“the 0 37 15
first 0 37 15
military 0 37 15
facility 0 37 15
Iran 0 37 15
has 0 37 15
ever 0 37 15
established 0 37 15

in 0 37 15
Iraq.” 0 37 15

holds 0 37 15
45 0 37 15
percent 0 37 15
of 0 37 15
Iraqi’s 0 37 15
oil. 0 37 15

The 1 37 16
Iraqi 1 37 16
branch 1 37 16
of 1 37 16
Iran’s 1 37 16
terrorist 1 37 16
proxy 1 37 16
Hezbollah 1 37 16
has 1 37 16
vowed 1 37 16
that 1 37 16
once 1 37 16
ISIS 1 37 16
is 1 37 16
defeated 1 37 16
it 1 37 16
will 1 37 16
start 1 37 16
killing 1 37 16
Americans, 1 37 16
as 1 37 16
it 1 37 16
has 1 37 16
done 1 37 16
before. 1 37 16

It 0 37 17
is 0 37 17
against 0 37 17
this 0 37 17
backdrop 0 37 17
that 0 37 17
U.S. 0 37 17

regime 0 37 17
on 0 37 17
multiple 0 37 17

The 0 37 18

to 0 37 18
the 0 37 18

Ambassador 0 37 18

departed 0 37 18
from 0 37 18
the 0 37 18
monthly 0 37 18
ritual 0 37 18
during 0 37 18
which 0 37 18
Israel 0 37 18
is 0 37 18
normally 0 37 18

criticism 0 37 18
by 0 37 18

She 0 37 19
went 0 37 19
after 0 37 19
Iran 0 37 19
instead. 0 37 19

She 0 37 20
explained 0 37 20
why 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Trump 0 37 20
administration 0 37 20
decided 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
take 0 37 20
“a 0 37 20
comprehensive 0 37 20
approach 0 37 20
to 0 37 20
confronting 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
Iranian 0 37 20
regime,” 0 37 20
which 0 37 20
does 0 37 20
not 0 37 20
give 0 37 20

card 0 37 20
even 0 37 20
if 0 37 20
it 0 37 20
is 0 37 20
in 0 37 20
technical 0 37 20
compliance 0 37 20
with 0 37 20
the 0 37 20
loophole-ridden 0 37 20
nuclear 0 37 20
deal 0 37 20
agreed 0 37 20
to 0 37 20

“We 0 37 21
can’t 0 37 21
talk 0 37 21
about 0 37 21
stability 0 37 21
in 0 37 21
the 0 37 21
Middle 0 37 21
East 0 37 21
without 0 37 21
talking 0 37 21
about 0 37 21
Iran,” 0 37 21
Ambassador 0 37 21
Haley 0 37 21
said. 0 37 21

“That’s 0 37 22
because 0 37 22
nearly 0 37 22
every 0 37 22
threat 0 37 22
to 0 37 22
peace 0 37 22
and 0 37 22
security 0 37 22
in 0 37 22
the 0 37 22
Middle 0 37 22

connected 0 37 22
to 0 37 22
Iran’s 0 37 22
outlaw 1 37 22
behavior. 1 37 22

The 0 37 23
United 0 37 23
States 0 37 23
has 0 37 23
now 0 37 23
embarked 0 37 23
on 0 37 23
a 0 37 23
course 0 37 23
that 0 37 23
attempts 0 37 23
to 0 37 23
address 0 37 23
all 0 37 23
aspects 0 37 23
of 0 37 23
Iran’s 0 37 23
destructive 0 37 23
conduct, 0 37 23
not 0 37 23
just 0 37 23
one 0 37 23
aspect. 0 37 23

It’s 0 37 24
critical 0 37 24
that 0 37 24
the 0 37 24
international 0 37 24
community 0 37 24
do 0 37 24
the 0 37 24
same. 0 37 24

Judging 0 37 25
Iran 0 37 25
by 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
narrow 0 37 25
confines 0 37 25
of 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
nuclear 0 37 25
deal 0 37 25
misses 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
true 0 37 25
nature 0 37 25
of 0 37 25
the 0 37 25
threat. 0 37 25

Iran 0 37 26
must 0 37 26
be 0 37 26
judged 0 37 26
in 0 37 26
totality 0 37 26
of 0 37 26
its 1 37 26
aggressive, 1 37 26
destabilizing, 1 37 26
and 1 37 26
unlawful 1 37 26
behavior. 1 37 26

To 1 37 27
do 1 37 27
otherwise 1 37 27
would 1 37 27
be 1 37 27
foolish.” 1 37 27

Ambassador 0 37 28
Haley 0 37 28
accused 0 37 28
the 0 37 28
Iranian 0 37 28
regime 0 37 28
of 0 37 28
continuing 0 37 28
to 0 37 28
“play” 0 37 28
the 0 37 28
Security 0 37 28
Council. 0 37 28

“Iran 0 37 29
hides 0 37 29
behind 0 37 29
its 0 37 29
assertion 0 37 29
of 0 37 29
technical 0 37 29
compliance 0 37 29
with 0 37 29
the 0 37 29
nuclear 0 37 29

while 0 37 29
it 0 37 29
brazenly 0 37 29
violates 0 37 29
the 0 37 29
other 0 37 29
limits 0 37 29
on 0 37 29
its 0 37 29
behavior. 0 37 29

And 0 37 30
we 0 37 30
have 0 37 30
allowed 0 37 30
them 0 37 30
to 0 37 30
get 0 37 30
away 0 37 30
with 0 37 30
it. 0 37 30

This 0 37 31
must 0 37 31
stop.” 0 37 31

Ambassador 0 37 32
Haley 0 37 32
proceeded 0 37 32
to 0 37 32
list 0 37 32
various 0 37 32
violations 0 37 32
by 0 37 32
the 0 37 32
Iranian 0 37 32
regime 0 37 32
of 0 37 32

of 0 37 32
conventional 0 37 32

in 0 37 32
Yemen 0 37 32
and 0 37 32
Hezbollah. 0 37 32

She 0 37 33
also 0 37 33
pointed 0 37 33
to 0 37 33
what 0 37 33
she 0 37 33
called 0 37 33
the 1 37 33
Iranian 1 37 33
regime’s 1 37 33
“most 1 37 33
threatening 1 37 33
act” 1 37 33
– 0 37 33
its 0 37 33
launch 0 37 33
of 0 37 33
ballistic 0 37 33
missiles 0 37 33
capable 0 37 33
of 0 37 33
carrying 0 37 33
nuclear 0 37 33
weapons. 0 37 33

“When 0 37 34
a 0 37 34

down 0 37 34
the 0 37 34
path 0 37 34
of 0 37 34
ballistic 0 37 34

it 1 37 34
tells 1 37 34
us 1 37 34
that 1 37 34
we 1 37 34
will 1 37 34

“If 1 37 35
it 1 37 35
is 1 37 35
wrong 1 37 35
for 1 37 35
North 1 37 35
Korea 1 37 35
to 1 37 35

on 0 37 40

at 0 37 41

very 0 37 41
same 0 37 41
time 0 37 41
that 0 37 41

was 0 37 41
negotiating 0 37 41

with 0 37 43
a 1 37 43
modicum 1 37 43
of 1 37 43
sense 1 37 43
really 0 37 43

thanks 0 37 44
to 0 37 44
the 0 37 44

out 0 37 45

the 0 37 46
nuclear 0 37 46
deal, 0 37 46
the 0 37 46
JCPOA 0 37 46
may 0 37 46
provide 0 37 46
a 0 37 46
loophole 0 37 46
for 0 37 46
Iran 0 37 46
to 0 37 46

which 0 37 46
North 0 37 46
Korea 0 37 46
desperately 0 37 46
needs. 0 37 46

Proponents 0 37 48
of 0 37 48

voiced 0 37 51
similar 0 37 51
concerns. 0 37 51

So 0 37 52
have 0 37 52
Obama’s 0 37 52
former 0 37 52
Secretaries 0 37 52
of 0 37 52
State 0 37 52
Hillary 0 37 52
Clinton 0 37 52
and 0 37 52
John 0 37 52
Kerry. 0 37 52

This 0 37 53
argument 0 37 53
is 0 37 53
absurd 0 37 53
on 0 37 53
its 0 37 53
face. 0 37 53

The 0 37 54
whole 0 37 54
point 0 37 54
is 0 37 54
to 0 37 54
prevent 0 37 54
Iran 0 37 54
from 0 37 54
becoming 0 37 54
the 0 37 54
next 0 37 54
North 0 37 54
Korea, 0 37 54
not 0 37 54
to 1 37 54
kick 1 37 54
the 1 37 54
can 1 37 54
down 1 37 54
the 1 37 54
road 1 37 54
as 1 37 54
usual. 1 37 54

pursuit 0 37 54

of 0 37 54

Will 0 40 0
Trump 0 40 0
Continue 0 40 0
the 0 40 0
CIA’s 0 40 0
JFK 0 40 0
Cover-Up? 0 40 0

Last 0 40 1
Friday, 0 40 1
President 0 40 1
Trump 0 40 1
made 0 40 1
the 0 40 1
following 0 40 1
announcement: 0 40 1

I 0 40 2
have 0 40 2
decided 0 40 2
not 0 40 2
to 0 40 2
block 0 40 2
release 0 40 2
of 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
CIA’s 0 40 2
remaining 0 40 2
JFK-assassination 0 40 2
related 0 40 2
records 0 40 2
except 0 40 2
for 0 40 2
those 0 40 2
records 0 40 2
that 0 40 2
directly 0 40 2
implicate 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
CIA 0 40 2
in 0 40 2
the 0 40 2
assassination, 0 40 2
which 0 40 2
will 0 40 2
continue 0 40 2
to 0 40 2
remain 0 40 2
secret.” 0 40 2

Okay, 0 40 3
he 0 40 3
didn’t 0 40 3
really 0 40 3
put 0 40 3
it 0 40 3
like 0 40 3
that. 0 40 3

But 0 40 4
that’s 0 40 4
the 0 40 4
potential 0 40 4
and 0 40 4
likely 0 40 4
import 0 40 4
of 0 40 4
his 0 40 4
announcement, 0 40 4
which 0 40 4
actually 0 40 4
read 0 40 4
as 0 40 4
follows: 0 40 4

Subject 0 40 5
to 0 40 5
the 0 40 5
receipt 0 40 5
of 0 40 5
further 0 40 5
information, 0 40 5
I 0 40 5
will 0 40 5
be 0 40 5
allowing, 0 40 5
as 0 40 5
President, 0 40 5
the 0 40 5
long 0 40 5
blocked 0 40 5
and 0 40 5
classified 0 40 5
JFK 0 40 5
FILES 0 40 5
to 0 40 5
be 0 40 5
opened.” 0 40 5
(Italics 0 40 5
added.) 0 40 5

The 0 40 6
operative 0 40 6
words, 0 40 6
of 0 40 6
course, 0 40 6
are: 0 40 6
“Subject 0 40 6
to 0 40 6
the 0 40 6
receipt 0 40 6
of 0 40 6
further 0 40 6
information….” 0 40 6

What 0 40 7
is 0 40 7
going 0 40 7
on 0 40 7
here? 0 40 7

Negotiations. 0 40 8

The 0 40 9
art 0 40 9
of 0 40 9
the 0 40 9
deal. 0 40 9

The 0 40 10
CIA 0 40 10
desperately 0 40 10
does 0 40 10
not 0 40 10
want 0 40 10
to 0 40 10
show 0 40 10
the 0 40 10
American 0 40 10
people 0 40 10
its 0 40 10
long-secret 0 40 10
JFK-related 0 40 10
records. 0 40 10

It 0 40 11
has 0 40 11
asked 0 40 11
Trump 0 40 11
to 0 40 11
continue 0 40 11
keeping 0 40 11
at 0 40 11
least 0 40 11
some 0 40 11
of 0 40 11
them 0 40 11
secret 0 40 11
notwithstanding 0 40 11
the 0 40 11
passage 0 40 11
of 0 40 11
more 0 40 11
than 0 40 11
50 0 40 11
years 0 40 11
since 0 40 11
the 0 40 11
Kennedy 0 40 11
assassination. 0 40 11

Under 0 40 12
long-established 0 40 12
custom 0 40 12
and 0 40 12
tradition 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
Washington, 0 40 12
D.C., 0 40 12
when 0 40 12
someone 0 40 12
asks 0 40 12
someone 0 40 12
else 0 40 12
for 0 40 12
a 0 40 12
favor, 0 40 12
the 0 40 12
person 0 40 12
who 0 40 12
is 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
a 0 40 12
position 0 40 12
to 0 40 12
grant 0 40 12
the 0 40 12
favor 0 40 12
demands 0 40 12
something 0 40 12
in 0 40 12
return. 0 40 12

That’s 0 40 13
where 0 40 13
the 0 40 13
negotiations 0 40 13
between 0 40 13
Trump 0 40 13
and 0 40 13
the 0 40 13
CIA 0 40 13
come 0 40 13
into 0 40 13
play. 0 40 13

Trump 0 40 14
wants 0 40 14
something 0 40 14
in 0 40 14
return. 0 40 14

We 0 40 15
don’t 0 40 15
know 0 40 15
what 0 40 15
— 0 40 15
maybe 0 40 15
laying 0 40 15
off 0 40 15
on 0 40 15
the 0 40 15
Russia 0 40 15
investigation 0 40 15
— 0 40 15
but 0 40 15
his 0 40 15
announcement 0 40 15
last 0 40 15
Friday 0 40 15
is 0 40 15
obviously 0 40 15
part 0 40 15
of 0 40 15
the 0 40 15
concluding 0 40 15
steps 0 40 15
of 0 40 15
such 0 40 15
negotiations. 0 40 15

Time 0 40 16
to 0 40 16
buy 0 40 16
old 0 40 16
US 0 40 16
gold 0 40 16
coins 0 40 16

What 0 40 17
Trump 0 40 17
has 0 40 17
done 0 40 17
with 0 40 17
his 0 40 17
announcement 0 40 17
is 0 40 17
send 0 40 17
a 0 40 17
clear 0 40 17
message 0 40 17
to 0 40 17
the 0 40 17
CIA: 0 40 17
“Give 0 40 17
me 0 40 17
what 0 40 17
I 0 40 17
want 0 40 17
and 0 40 17
I’ll 0 40 17
give 0 40 17
you 0 40 17
want 0 40 17
you 0 40 17
want. 0 40 17

Otherwise, 0 40 18
I 0 40 18
will 0 40 18
let 0 40 18
all 0 40 18
your 0 40 18
cherished 1 40 18
long-secret 1 40 18
records 1 40 18
relating 0 40 18
to 0 40 18
the 0 40 18
JFK 0 40 18
assassination 0 40 18
be 0 40 18
shown 0 40 18
to 0 40 18
the 0 40 18
American 0 40 18
people.” 0 40 18

Make 0 40 19
no 0 40 19
mistake 0 40 19
about 0 40 19
it: 0 40 19
A 0 40 19
deal 0 40 19
is 0 40 19
about 0 40 19
to 0 40 19
be 0 40 19
made. 0 40 19

The 0 40 20
CIA 0 40 20
will 0 40 20
cave. 0 40 20

It 0 40 21
will 0 40 21
end 0 40 21
up 0 40 21
giving 0 40 21
Trump 0 40 21
whatever 0 40 21
it 0 40 21
is 0 40 21
he 0 40 21
wants. 0 40 21

Trump 1 40 22
is 1 40 22
in 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
driver’s 1 40 22
seat 1 40 22
because 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
CIA 1 40 22
cannot 1 40 22
afford 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
permit 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
American 1 40 22
people 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
see 1 40 22
the 1 40 22
records 1 40 22
it 1 40 22
wants 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
continue 1 40 22
to 1 40 22
be 1 40 22
kept 1 40 22
secret. 1 40 22

And 0 40 23
once 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
CIA 1 40 23
gives 1 40 23
Trump 1 40 23
what 1 40 23
he 1 40 23
wants, 1 40 23
he 1 40 23
will 1 40 23
cave 1 40 23
and 1 40 23
give 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
CIA 1 40 23
the 1 40 23
continued 1 40 23
secrecy 1 40 23
it 1 40 23
so 1 40 23
desperately 1 40 23
needs. 1 40 23

All 0 40 24
this 0 40 24
will 0 40 24
happen 0 40 24
by 0 40 24
this 0 40 24
Thursday, 0 40 24
the 0 40 24
date 0 40 24
set 0 40 24
by 0 40 24
law 0 40 24
for 0 40 24
release 0 40 24
of 0 40 24
all 0 40 24
the 0 40 24
JFK 0 40 24
records 0 40 24
that 0 40 24
Trump 0 40 24
has 0 40 24
not 0 40 24
blocked. 0 40 24

Think 0 40 25
about 0 40 25
it: 0 40 25
The 0 40 25
CIA 0 40 25
has 0 40 25
asked 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
president 0 40 25
to 0 40 25
continue 0 40 25
secrecy 0 40 25
of 0 40 25
records 0 40 25
that 0 40 25
are 0 40 25
more 0 40 25
than 0 40 25
50 0 40 25
years 0 40 25
old 0 40 25
or, 0 40 25
apparently, 0 40 25
some 0 40 25
relating 0 40 25
to 0 40 25
secret 0 40 25
correspondence 0 40 25
between 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
CIA 0 40 25
and 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
Assassination 0 40 25
Records 0 40 25
Review 0 40 25
Board 0 40 25
back 0 40 25
in 0 40 25
the 0 40 25
1990s. 0 40 25

The 0 40 26
CIA’s 0 40 26
ground? 0 40 26

“National 0 40 27
security” 0 40 27
of 0 40 27
course, 0 40 27
the 1 40 27
two 1 40 27
most 1 40 27
important 1 40 27
and 1 40 27
meaningless 1 40 27
words 1 40 27
in 0 40 27
the 0 40 27
American 0 40 27
political 0 40 27
lexicon. 0 40 27

National 0 40 28
security? 0 40 28

Really? 0 40 29

Whatever 0 40 30
definition 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
one 0 40 30
might 0 40 30
put 0 40 30
on 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
nebulous 0 40 30
term, 0 40 30
no 1 40 30
reasonable 1 40 30
person 1 40 30
can 1 40 30
honestly 1 40 30
believe 1 40 30
that 0 40 30
the 0 40 30
release 0 40 30
of 0 40 30
50-year-old 0 40 30
records 0 40 30
are 0 40 30
going 0 40 30
to 0 40 30
result 1 40 30
in 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
United 1 40 30
States 1 40 30
falling 1 40 30
into 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
ocean 1 40 30
or 0 40 30
even 0 40 30
that 0 40 30
the 1 40 30
communists 1 40 30
are 1 40 30
going 1 40 30
to 1 40 30
take 1 40 30
over 1 40 30
the 1 40 30
federal 1 40 30
government. 1 40 30

The 0 40 31
CIA 0 40 31
says 0 40 31
that 0 40 31
releasing 0 40 31
its 0 40 31
decades-old 0 40 31
JFK 0 40 31
records 0 40 31
will 0 40 31
reveal 0 40 31
secret 0 40 31
“methods” 0 40 31
of 0 40 31
intelligence 0 40 31
gathering. 0 40 31

Really? 1 40 32

What, 1 40 33
like 1 40 33
the 1 40 33
CIA 1 40 33
was 1 40 33
using 1 40 33
typewriters 1 40 33
instead 1 40 33
of 1 40 33
computers 1 40 33
and 1 40 33
pay 1 40 33
telephones 1 40 33
instead 1 40 33
of 1 40 33
cell 1 40 33
phones? 1 40 33

What 0 40 34
is 0 40 34
amazing 0 40 34
(or 0 40 34
not) 0 40 34
is 0 40 34
the 1 40 34
extreme 1 40 34
nonchalance 1 40 34
of 0 40 34
the 0 40 34
mainstream 0 40 34
media 0 40 34
to 0 40 34
the 0 40 34
CIA’s 0 40 34
request 0 40 34
for 0 40 34
continued 0 40 34
secrecy. 0 40 34

That 0 40 35
should 0 40 35
be 0 40 35
big 0 40 35
news. 0 40 35

It’s 1 40 36
essentially 1 40 36
an 1 40 36
admission 1 40 36
of 1 40 36
guilt, 1 40 36
given 0 40 36
that 0 40 36
it 0 40 36
is 0 40 36
absolutely 1 40 36
ludicrous 1 40 36
to 0 40 36
think 0 40 36
that 0 40 36
“national 0 40 36
security” 0 40 36
would 0 40 36
be 0 40 36
threatened 0 40 36
by 0 40 36
the 0 40 36
release 0 40 36
of 0 40 36
the 0 40 36
CIA’s 0 40 36
long-secret 0 40 36
JFK-assassination-related 0 40 36
records. 0 40 36

You 0 40 37
see, 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
mainstream 0 40 37
media 0 40 37
starts 0 40 37
with 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
assumption 0 40 37
that 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
CIA 0 40 37
had 0 40 37
nothing 0 40 37
to 0 40 37
do 0 40 37
with 0 40 37
the 0 40 37
assassination. 0 40 37

In 0 40 38
their 0 40 38
minds, 0 40 38
the 0 40 38
assassination 0 40 38
was 0 40 38
committed 0 40 38
by 0 40 38
a 0 40 38
lone 1 40 38
nut 1 40 38
former 1 40 38
U.S. 1 40 38
Marine 1 40 38
communist, 1 40 38
one 0 40 38
who 0 40 38
had 0 40 38
no 0 40 38
motive 0 40 38
to 0 40 38
kill 0 40 38
the 0 40 38
president. 0 40 38

Such 0 40 39
being 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
case, 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
mainstream 0 40 39
media, 0 40 39
deferring 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
CIA, 0 40 39
automatically 0 40 39
concludes 0 40 39
that 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
wish 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
continue 0 40 39
keeping 0 40 39
secret 0 40 39
has 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
be 0 40 39
based 0 40 39
on 0 40 39
“national 0 40 39
security” 0 40 39
grounds 0 40 39
rather 0 40 39
than 0 40 39
an 0 40 39
attempt 0 40 39
by 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
CIA 0 40 39
to 0 40 39
continue 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
cover-up 0 40 39
of 0 40 39
its 0 40 39
assassination 0 40 39
of 0 40 39
the 0 40 39
president. 0 40 39

Let’s 0 40 40
proceed 0 40 40
from 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
opposite 0 40 40
assumption: 0 40 40
That 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
CIA, 0 40 40
in 0 40 40
partnership 0 40 40
with 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
military 0 40 40
and 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
Mafia, 0 40 40
orchestrated 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
assassination 0 40 40
by 0 40 40
framing 0 40 40
a 0 40 40
former 0 40 40
U.S. 0 40 40
Marine 0 40 40
who 0 40 40
was 0 40 40
then 0 40 40
working 0 40 40
for 0 40 40
U.S. 0 40 40
intelligence, 0 40 40
either 0 40 40
Navy 0 40 40
intelligence, 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
CIA, 0 40 40
or 0 40 40
the 0 40 40
FBI, 0 40 40
or 0 40 40
a 0 40 40
combination 0 40 40
of 0 40 40
all 0 40 40
three. 0 40 40

Don’t 0 40 41
forget, 0 40 41
after 0 40 41
all, 0 40 41
that 0 40 41
that’s 0 40 41
what 0 40 41
Oswald 0 40 41
said. 0 40 41

He 0 40 42
said 0 40 42
he 0 40 42
was 0 40 42
being 0 40 42
framed. 0 40 42

Yet, 0 40 43
from 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
very 0 40 43
beginning, 0 40 43
the 1 40 43
mainstream 1 40 43
media 1 40 43
has 1 40 43
never 1 40 43
given 1 40 43
any 1 40 43
serious 1 40 43
consideration 1 40 43
to 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
possibility 0 40 43
that 0 40 43
Oswald 0 40 43
was 0 40 43
framed 0 40 43
for 0 40 43
the 0 40 43
crime. 0 40 43

Instead, 0 40 44
they 0 40 44
have 0 40 44
steadfastly 0 40 44
stuck 0 40 44
with 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
official 0 40 44
story, 0 40 44
one 0 40 44
that 0 40 44
has 0 40 44
all 0 40 44
the 0 40 44
characteristics 0 40 44
of 0 40 44
a 0 40 44
pat 1 40 44
frame-up: 1 40 44
That 0 40 44
Oswald 0 40 44
acted 0 40 44
alone 0 40 44
or 0 40 44
possibly 0 40 44
acted 0 40 44
in 0 40 44
concert 0 40 44
with 0 40 44
others, 0 40 44
both 0 40 44
of 0 40 44
which 0 40 44
lead 0 40 44
to 0 40 44
nothing 0 40 44
but 0 40 44
dead 0 40 44
ends, 0 40 44
contradictions, 0 40 44
and 0 40 44
anomalies. 0 40 44

Now, 0 40 45
let’s 0 40 45
assume 0 40 45
instead 0 40 45
that 0 40 45
Oswald 0 40 45
was 0 40 45
telling 0 40 45
the 0 40 45
truth 0 40 45
when 0 40 45
he 0 40 45
said 0 40 45
he 0 40 45
was 0 40 45
being 0 40 45
framed. 0 40 45

In 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
case, 0 40 46
it 0 40 46
would 0 40 46
be 0 40 46
imperative 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
CIA 0 40 46
and 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
military 0 40 46
keep 0 40 46
as 0 40 46
tight 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
lid 0 40 46
on 0 40 46
their 0 40 46
records 0 40 46
as 0 40 46
possible 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
ensure 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
investigators 0 40 46
or 0 40 46
investigative 0 40 46
reporters 0 40 46
would 0 40 46
have 0 40 46
a 0 40 46
difficult 0 40 46
time 0 40 46
piercing 0 40 46
through 0 40 46
to 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
circumstantial 0 40 46
evidence 0 40 46
that 0 40 46
establishes 0 40 46
the 0 40 46
frame-up. 0 40 46

As 0 40 47
part 0 40 47
of 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
frame-up, 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
CIA 0 40 47
would 0 40 47
have 0 40 47
to 0 40 47
fortify 0 40 47
the 0 40 47
persona 0 40 47
of 0 40 47
Oswald, 0 40 47
its 0 40 47
intelligence 0 40 47
agent, 0 40 47
as 0 40 47
a 0 40 47
purported 1 40 47
communist. 1 40 47

That 1 40 48
would 1 40 48
enable 1 40 48
the 1 40 48
CIA 1 40 48
to 1 40 48
blame 1 40 48
the 1 40 48
assassination 1 40 48
on 1 40 48
a 1 40 48
communist, 1 40 48
which, 0 40 48
not 0 40 48
coincidentally, 0 40 48
was 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
advice 0 40 48
that 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
Pentagon 0 40 48
and 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
CIA 0 40 48
were 0 40 48
doling 0 40 48
out 0 40 48
to 0 40 48
Latin 0 40 48
American 0 40 48
military 0 40 48
dictatorships 0 40 48
at 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
School 0 40 48
of 0 40 48
the 0 40 48
Americas. 0 40 48

In 0 40 49
cases 0 40 49
of 0 40 49
covert 0 40 49
state-sponsored 0 40 49
assassinations, 0 40 49
Latin 0 40 49
American 0 40 49
regimes 0 40 49
were 0 40 49
taught, 0 40 49
a 1 40 49
good 1 40 49
strategy 1 40 49
was 1 40 49
to 1 40 49
blame 1 40 49
the 1 40 49
assassination 1 40 49
on 1 40 49
a 1 40 49
communist 1 40 49
because 1 40 49
then 1 40 49
they 1 40 49
could 1 40 49
smear 1 40 49
anyone 1 40 49
who 1 40 49
challenged 1 40 49
the 1 40 49
official 1 40 49
story 1 40 49
as 1 40 49
a 1 40 49
communist 1 40 49
sympathizer. 1 40 49

It 0 40 50
would 0 40 50
also 0 40 50
explain 0 40 50
why 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
CIA 0 40 50
was 0 40 50
closely 0 40 50
monitoring 0 40 50
Oswald’s 0 40 50
movements 0 40 50
prior 0 40 50
to 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
assassination, 0 40 50
something 0 40 50
else 0 40 50
that 0 40 50
the 0 40 50
CIA 0 40 50
kept 0 40 50
secret 0 40 50
for 0 40 50
decades. 0 40 50

They 1 40 51
had 1 40 51
to 1 40 51
make 1 40 51
certain 1 40 51
that 1 40 51
Oswald 1 40 51
was 1 40 51
not 1 40 51
on 1 40 51
to 1 40 51
them 1 40 51
and 1 40 51
had 1 40 51
not 1 40 51
discovered 1 40 51
that 1 40 51
he 1 40 51
was 1 40 51
being 1 40 51
set 1 40 51
up 1 40 51
for 1 40 51
a 1 40 51
frame-up. 1 40 51

The 0 40 52
first 0 40 52
organization 0 40 52
that 0 40 52
came 0 40 52
out 0 40 52
with 0 40 52
a 0 40 52
press 0 40 52
release 0 40 52
advertising 0 40 52
Oswald’s 0 40 52
bona 0 40 52
fides 0 40 52
was 0 40 52
the 0 40 52
DRE, 0 40 52
an 0 40 52
anti-communist 0 40 52
group 0 40 52
in 0 40 52
New 0 40 52
Orleans 0 40 52
with 0 40 52
which 0 40 52
Oswald 0 40 52
had 0 40 52
had 0 40 52
contact. 0 40 52

What 0 40 53
no 0 40 53
one 0 40 53
knew 0 40 53
at 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
time, 0 40 53
and 0 40 53
what 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
CIA 0 40 53
intentionally 0 40 53
kept 0 40 53
secret 0 40 53
for 0 40 53
decades, 0 40 53
was 0 40 53
that 0 40 53
the 0 40 53
DRE 0 40 53
was 0 40 53
a 0 40 53
CIA 0 40 53
front 0 40 53
organization. 0 40 53

It 0 40 54
was 0 40 54
being 0 40 54
generously 0 40 54
funded 0 40 54
by 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
and 0 40 54
controlled 0 40 54
by 0 40 54
a 0 40 54
secret 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
agent 0 40 54
named 0 40 54
George 0 40 54
Joannides, 0 40 54
which 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
CIA 0 40 54
would 0 40 54
intentionally 0 40 54
keep 0 40 54
secret 0 40 54
from 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
Warren 0 40 54
Commission 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1960s, 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
House 0 40 54
Select 0 40 54
Committee 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1970s, 0 40 54
and 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
Assassination 0 40 54
Records 0 40 54
Review 0 40 54
Board 0 40 54
in 0 40 54
the 0 40 54
1990s. 0 40 54

But 0 40 55
there 0 40 55
was 0 40 55
another 0 40 55
big 0 40 55
operation 0 40 55
to 0 40 55
establish 0 40 55
Oswald’s 0 40 55
communist 0 40 55
bona 0 40 55
fides 0 40 55
before 0 40 55
the 0 40 55
assassination. 0 40 55

It 0 40 56
had 0 40 56
to 0 40 56
do 0 40 56
with 0 40 56
Oswald’s 0 40 56
trip 0 40 56
to 0 40 56
Mexico 0 40 56
City, 0 40 56
where 0 40 56
he 0 40 56
visited 0 40 56
the 0 40 56
Cuban 0 40 56
and 0 40 56
Soviet 0 40 56
embassies. 0 40 56

Something 1 40 57
dreadful 1 40 57
obviously 0 40 57
went 0 40 57
wrong 0 40 57
with 0 40 57
that 0 40 57
part 0 40 57
of 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
operation 0 40 57
because 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
official 0 40 57
investigation 0 40 57
into 0 40 57
it 0 40 57
was 0 40 57
quickly 0 40 57
shut 0 40 57
down 0 40 57
during 0 40 57
the 0 40 57
early 0 40 57
post-assassination 0 40 57
period. 0 40 57

Today, 0 40 58
Oswald’s 0 40 58
Mexico 0 40 58
City 0 40 58
trip, 0 40 58
which 0 40 58
is 0 40 58
part 0 40 58
of 0 40 58
those 0 40 58
CIA 0 40 58
records 0 40 58
ready 0 40 58
to 0 40 58
be 0 40 58
released, 0 40 58
is 0 40 58
still 0 40 58
shrouded 0 40 58
in 0 40 58
mystery. 0 40 58

The 0 40 59
CIA’s 0 40 59
continued 0 40 59
secrecy 0 40 59
in 0 40 59
the 0 40 59
JFK 0 40 59
assassination 0 40 59
is 0 40 59
no 0 40 59
big 0 40 59
surprise. 0 40 59

As 0 40 60
I 0 40 60
wrote 0 40 60
in 0 40 60
my 0 40 60
October 0 40 60
11 0 40 60
article, 0 40 60
“Will 0 40 60
Trump 0 40 60
Make 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
Deal 0 40 60
with 0 40 60
the 0 40 60
CIA 0 40 60
on 0 40 60
JFK 0 40 60
Records?,” 0 40 60
the 0 40 60
CIA 0 40 60
is 0 40 60
between 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
rock 0 40 60
and 0 40 60
a 0 40 60
hard 0 40 60
place. 0 40 60

On 0 40 61
the 0 40 61
one 0 40 61
hand, 0 40 61
it 1 40 61
knows 1 40 61
that 1 40 61
those 1 40 61
records 1 40 61
will 1 40 61
further 1 40 61
implicate 1 40 61
the 1 40 61
CIA 1 40 61
in 1 40 61
the 1 40 61
Kennedy 1 40 61
assassination. 1 40 61

On 0 40 62
the 0 40 62
other 0 40 62
hand, 0 40 62
it 0 40 62
knows 0 40 62
that 0 40 62
by 1 40 62
seeking 1 40 62
continued 1 40 62
secrecy, 1 40 62
it’s 1 40 62
essentially 1 40 62
an 1 40 62
implicit 1 40 62
acknowledgment 1 40 62
of 1 40 62
guilt. 1 40 62

Not 0 40 63
surprisingly, 0 40 63
it 0 40 63
is 0 40 63
choosing 0 40 63
the 0 40 63
latter 0 40 63
course, 0 40 63
especially 0 40 63
because 1 40 63
it 1 40 63
knows 1 40 63
that 1 40 63
its 1 40 63
assets 1 40 63
and 1 40 63
allies 1 40 63
in 1 40 63
the 1 40 63
mainstream 1 40 63
press 1 40 63
will 1 40 63
continue 1 40 63
to 1 40 63
come 1 40 63
to 1 40 63
its 1 40 63
defense 1 40 63
with 0 40 63
respect 0 40 63
to 0 40 63
its 0 40 63
ridiculous 0 40 63
claim 0 40 63
of 0 40 63
“national 0 40 63
security.” 0 40 63

Do 0 40 64
the 0 40 64
CIA’s 0 40 64
long-secret 0 40 64
records 0 40 64
contain 0 40 64
a 0 40 64
video-taped 0 40 64
confession? 0 40 64

Of 0 40 65
course 0 40 65
not. 0 40 65

And 0 40 66
they 0 40 66
don’t 0 40 66
contain 0 40 66
any 0 40 66
reference 0 40 66
to 0 40 66
assassinating 0 40 66
Kennedy. 0 40 66

The 0 40 67
CIA’s 0 40 67
practice 0 40 67
from 0 40 67
the 0 40 67
very 0 40 67
beginning 0 40 67
has 0 40 67
been 0 40 67
to 0 40 67
not 0 40 67
put 0 40 67
any 0 40 67
reference 0 40 67
to 0 40 67
a 0 40 67
state-sponsored 0 40 67
assassination 0 40 67
into 0 40 67
writing. 0 40 67

But 0 40 68
there 0 40 68
has 0 40 68
to 0 40 68
be 0 40 68
a 0 40 68
reason 0 40 68
why 0 40 68
the 0 40 68
CIA 0 40 68
chose 0 40 68
to 0 40 68
keep 0 40 68
this 0 40 68
particular 0 40 68
batch 0 40 68
of 0 40 68
records 0 40 68
secret 0 40 68
for 0 40 68
more 0 40 68
than 0 40 68
50 0 40 68
years. 0 40 68

Those 0 40 69
long-secret 0 40 69
records 0 40 69
undoubtedly 0 40 69
include 0 40 69
small 0 40 69
bits 0 40 69
of 0 40 69
important 0 40 69
circumstantial 0 40 69

In 0 40 70
1953, 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
CIA 0 40 70
was 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
process 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
developing 0 40 70
a 0 40 70
top-secret 0 40 70
manual 0 40 70
on 0 40 70
assassinations, 0 40 70
one 0 40 70
that 0 40 70
showed 0 40 70
that 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
CIA 0 40 70
was 0 40 70
specializing 0 40 70
not 0 40 70
only 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
art 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
assassination 0 40 70
but 0 40 70
also 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
the 0 40 70
art 0 40 70
of 0 40 70
covering 0 40 70
up 0 40 70
its 0 40 70
role 0 40 70
in 0 40 70
state-sponsored 0 40 70
assassinations. 0 40 70

Every 1 40 71
American 1 40 71
owes 1 40 71
it 1 40 71
to 1 40 71
himself 1 40 71
to 1 40 71
read 1 40 71
that 1 40 71
manual. 1 40 71

Too 0 40 72
bad 0 40 72
the 0 40 72
mainstream 0 40 72
press 0 40 72
has 0 40 72
never 0 40 72

the 0 40 72
consideration 0 40 72
it 0 40 72

If 0 40 73
it 0 40 73
did, 0 40 73
it 0 40 73

that 0 41 4

But 0 51 2
the 0 51 2
worst 0 51 2
news 0 51 2
is 0 51 2
that 0 51 2
the 1 51 2

could 1 51 2

anytime 1 51 2
unleashing 1 51 2
the 1 51 2
sickness 1 51 2
on 1 51 2
the 1 51 2

pneumonic 0 51 3
strain 0 51 3
of 0 51 3
the 0 51 3
medieval 0 51 3
disease. 0 51 3

But 0 51 4
the 0 51 4
oncoming 0 51 4
rainy 0 51 4
season 0 51 4
could 0 51 4
see 0 51 4
the 0 51 4
number 0 51 4
of 0 51 4
those 0 51 4

explode 1 51 4
exponentially. 0 51 4

The 0 51 5
rainy 0 51 5
season 0 51 5
poses 0 51 5
a 0 51 5
threat 0 51 5
to 0 51 5
the 0 51 5
containment 0 51 5
of 0 51 5
the 0 51 5
plague 0 51 5
because 0 51 5
outbreaks 0 51 5
of 0 51 5
this 0 51 5
magnitude 0 51 5
often 0 51 5
seem 0 51 5
to 0 51 5
be 0 51 5
seasonal. 0 51 5

The 0 51 6
Foreign 0 51 6
Office 0 51 6
recently 0 51 6
warned 0 51 6
that 0 51 6
the 1 51 6

outbreak 1 51 6
is 1 51 6
entering 1 51 6
its 1 51 6
most 1 51 6
dangerous 1 51 6
phase. 1 51 6

Its 0 51 7
website 0 51 7
said 0 51 7
that 0 51 7
“outbreaks 0 51 7
of 0 51 7
plague 0 51 7
tend 0 51 7
to 0 51 7
be 0 51 7
seasonal 0 51 7
and 0 51 7
occur 0 51 7
mainly 0 51 7
during 0 51 7
the 0 51 7
rainy 0 51 7
season.” 0 51 7
The 0 51 7
African 0 51 7
island’s 0 51 7
wet 0 51 7
season 0 51 7
officially 0 51 7
began 0 51 7
today 0 51 7
and 0 51 7
will 0 51 7
last 0 51 7
until 0 51 7
the 0 51 7
end 0 51 7
of 0 51 7
April, 0 51 7
meaning 0 51 7
the 1 51 7
downward 1 51 7
trend 1 51 7
the 1 51 7
plague 1 51 7
had 1 51 7
seen 1 51 7
over 1 51 7
the 1 51 7
past 1 51 7
few 1 51 7
days, 1 51 7
will 1 51 7
likely 1 51 7
turn 1 51 7
upward 1 51 7
again. 1 51 7

Because 0 51 8
the 0 51 8
disease 0 51 8
can 0 51 8
be 0 51 8
spread 0 51 8
easily 0 51 8
through 0 51 8
a 0 51 8
cough 0 51 8
or 0 51 8
sneeze, 0 51 8
experts 0 51 8
are 0 51 8
fearful. 0 51 8

It 1 51 9
would 1 51 9
take 1 51 9
just 1 51 9
one 1 51 9

as 0 51 10
a 0 51 10
precaution. 0 51 10

The 1 51 11
outbreak 1 51 11
has 1 51 11
been 1 51 11
fueled 1 51 11
by 1 51 11
performing 1 51 11
the 1 51 11
ancient 1 51 11
practice 1 51 11
of 1 51 11
Famadihana. 1 51 11

Famadihana 0 51 12
is 0 51 12
the 0 51 12
“dancing 0 51 12

them 0 51 12

a 0 51 13
corpse 0 51 13
who’s 0 51 13

because 0 51 13
they 0 51 13
contracted 0 51 13
the 0 51 13

had 1 55 4
prior 1 55 4

This 0 55 5
is 0 55 5
the 0 55 5
atmosphere 0 55 5
that 0 55 5
Jewish 0 55 5
students 0 55 5

on 0 55 5

basis 0 55 5
at 0 55 5
McGill. 0 55 5

The 1 55 6
toxic 1 55 6
environment 1 55 6
is 0 55 6
due 0 55 6
almost 0 55 6
exclusively 0 55 6
to 0 55 6
an 0 55 6
active 0 55 6
and 0 55 6
vocal 0 55 6
presence 0 55 6
of 0 55 6

on 0 55 6
campus. 0 55 6

Lew 0 55 7
followed 0 55 7
the 0 55 7
advice 0 55 7
and 0 55 7
was 0 55 7
elected 0 55 7
as 0 55 7
a 0 55 7
board 0 55 7
member. 0 55 7

His 0 55 8

was 0 55 8
intact. 0 55 8

BDS 1 55 9
provocateurs 1 55 9
at 0 55 9
McGill 0 55 9
had 0 55 9
relentlessly 0 55 9
tried 0 55 9

failed 0 55 9
to 0 55 9
pass 0 55 9

in 0 55 11
June 0 55 11
2016, 0 55 11
SSMU’s 0 55 11
Judicial 0 55 11

The 0 55 12

ruling, 0 55 12
which 0 55 12
is 0 55 12
called 0 55 12
a 0 55 12
“reference,” 0 55 12

referred 0 55 12
to 0 55 12

addressed 0 55 13
the 0 55 13

more 0 55 13
than 0 55 13
a 0 55 13

after 0 55 13
the 0 55 13

Lew 0 55 13
and 0 55 13
other 0 55 13
board 0 55 13

passionately 1 55 13
advocated 1 55 13
in 0 55 13
favor 0 55 13
of 0 55 13
ratification 0 55 13
and 0 55 13
their 0 55 13
arguments 0 55 13
ultimately 0 55 13
prevailed 0 55 13
over 0 55 13
the 0 55 13
naysayers. 0 55 13

The 1 55 14
malevolent 1 55 14
BDS 1 55 14
campaign 1 55 14
at 0 55 14
McGill 0 55 14
had 0 55 14
belatedly 0 55 14
come 0 55 14
to 0 55 14
an 0 55 14
ignominious 1 55 14
end; 1 55 14
or 0 55 14
so 0 55 14
we 0 55 14
thought. 0 55 14

Lew 0 55 15
and 0 55 15
two 0 55 15

as 0 55 15
either 0 55 15
Jewish 0 55 15
or 0 55 15
pro-Israel 0 55 15
became 0 55 15
instant 0 55 15
targets 0 55 15
of 0 55 15
a 1 55 15
campaign 1 55 15
of 1 55 15
hate 1 55 15
laced 1 55 15
with 1 55 15
blatant 1 55 15
anti-Semitic 1 55 15
overtones. 1 55 15

Campus 0 55 16
BDS 0 55 16
groups 0 55 16
held 0 55 16
several 0 55 16
meetings 0 55 16
to 0 55 16
formulate 0 55 16
a 0 55 16
response 0 55 16

the 0 55 16
so-called 0 55 16
“Democratize 0 55 16

But 1 55 17
Democratize 1 55 17

was 1 55 17
anything 1 55 17

democratic. 1 55 17

Its 0 55 18

As 0 55 19
a 0 55 19

Sadikov 0 55 20
made 0 55 20
light 0 55 20
of 0 55 20
his 0 55 20
“punch 1 55 20

it 0 55 20
a 0 55 20
“misguided 1 55 20

It 0 55 20
does 0 55 20
not 0 55 20
appear 0 55 20
that 0 55 20
Sadikov 0 55 20

despite 0 55 20
the 0 55 20
fact 0 55 20
that 0 55 20
his 0 55 20

for 0 55 20

violated 0 55 20

McGill’s 0 55 21

as 0 55 22
a 0 55 22
reason 0 55 22
for 0 55 22
his 0 55 22
removal. 0 55 22

An 1 55 23
enlightened, 1 55 23
progressive 1 55 23
school 1 55 23
was 1 55 23
suddenly 1 55 23
transformed 1 55 23
into 1 55 23
something 1 55 23
harking 1 55 23
back 1 55 23
to 1 55 23
the 1 55 23
days 1 55 23
of 1 55 23
Nazi 1 55 23
Germany 1 55 23
and 1 55 23
the 1 55 23
Nuremberg 1 55 23
Laws. 1 55 23

In 0 55 24
October, 0 55 24
SSMU’s 0 55 24
General 0 55 24
Assembly 0 55 24
moved 0 55 24
to 0 55 24

the 0 55 24
12-member 0 55 24
Board 0 55 24
of 0 55 24

According 0 55 25
to 0 55 25
Lew, 0 55 25
“historically, 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
Board 0 55 25
of 0 55 25

all 0 55 25

at 0 55 25
a 0 55 25
time.” 0 55 25
But 0 55 25
BDS 0 55 25
activists 0 55 25
who 0 55 25
showed 0 55 25
up 0 55 25
for 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
General 0 55 25
Assembly 0 55 25
ratification 0 55 25
forced 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
voting 0 55 25
to 0 55 25
occur 0 55 25
on 0 55 25
an 0 55 25
individual 0 55 25
basis 0 55 25
rather 0 55 25
than 0 55 25
a 0 55 25
block 0 55 25
as 0 55 25
was 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
accepted 0 55 25
protocol. 0 55 25

In 0 55 26
this 0 55 26
manner, 0 55 26
BDS/ 0 55 26
Democratize 0 55 26
SSMU 0 55 26
activists 0 55 26
managed 0 55 26
to 0 55 26
pick 0 55 26
off 0 55 26
their 0 55 26
opponents 0 55 26
one 0 55 26
at 0 55 26
a 0 55 26
time. 0 55 26

It 0 55 27
was 0 55 27
repulsive 1 55 27
display 1 55 27
leftist-fascist 1 55 27
bigotry 1 55 27
at 1 55 27
its 1 55 27
worst. 1 55 27

The 1 55 28
bigoted 1 55 28
BDS 1 55 28
provocateurs 1 55 28
applauded 0 55 28
as 0 55 28
Lew 0 55 28
and 0 55 28
the 0 55 28
other 0 55 28
two 0 55 28
board 0 55 28

were 0 55 28
removed 0 55 28
from 0 55 28
their 0 55 28

But 0 55 29
this 0 55 29
time, 0 55 29
they 0 55 29
may 0 55 29
have 0 55 29
gone 0 55 29
too 0 55 29
far. 0 55 29

Even 0 55 30
by 0 55 30
BDS 0 55 30
standards, 0 55 30
their 1 55 30
manifestly 1 55 30
anti-Semitic 1 55 30
campaign 1 55 30
antics 1 55 30
were 1 55 30
beyond 1 55 30
the 1 55 30
pale. 1 55 30

BDS 0 55 31
activists 0 55 31
generally 0 55 31
avoid 0 55 31
reference 0 55 31
to 0 55 31
“Jews” 0 55 31
by 0 55 31
name 0 55 31
because 0 55 31
it 0 55 31
is 0 55 31
impolitic 0 55 31
and 0 55 31
commonly 0 55 31
substitute 0 55 31
“Zionists” 0 55 31
for 0 55 31
Jews 0 55 31
even 0 55 31
though 0 55 31
most 0 55 31
of 0 55 31

cognizant 0 55 31
of 0 55 31

But 0 55 32
in 0 55 32
the 0 55 32
instant 0 55 32
case, 0 55 32
McGill’s 0 55 32
BDS 0 55 32
campaigners 0 55 32
dispensed 0 55 32
with 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
traditional 0 55 32
charade 1 55 32
and 0 55 32
overtly 0 55 32
launched 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
attack 0 55 32
against 0 55 32

The 1 55 33
vitriolic 1 55 33
BDS 1 55 33
campaign 1 55 33
immediately 0 55 33
sparked 1 55 33
outrage 1 55 33
among 0 55 33
watchdog 0 55 33
groups 0 55 33
and 0 55 33
politicians 0 55 33
prompting 0 55 33
McGill 0 55 33
principal, 0 55 33
Suzanne 0 55 33
Fortier, 0 55 33
to 0 55 33

For 0 64 11
Chris 0 64 11

apparently 0 64 11
“fascism” 0 64 11
means 0 64 11

Why 0 64 13
are 0 64 13
we 0 64 13
“far 0 64 13

Everything 0 64 14

any 0 64 16

one 1 64 20

five 1 64 20
things. 1 64 20

One 1 64 21
– 1 64 21
the 1 64 21
easiest 1 64 21
one 1 64 21

off, 1 64 21
that’s 1 64 21
the 1 64 21
easiest. 1 64 21

– 1 64 22
burn 1 64 22
them 1 64 22
to 1 64 22

Third 1 64 23
– 1 64 23
throw 1 64 23
’em 1 64 23
off 1 64 23
a 1 64 23
cliff. 1 64 23

they 1 64 24

under 1 64 24
that. 1 64 24

Fifth 1 64 25
– 1 64 25

of 1 64 25
the 1 64 25
above.” 1 64 25

what 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Pope 0 106 3
is 0 106 3
up 0 106 3
to: 0 106 3
“The 0 106 3
fact 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
the 0 106 3

requested 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
his 0 106 3

interpretations 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
Buenos 0 106 3

published 0 106 3
in 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
AAS 0 106 3
means 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
His 0 106 3
Holiness 0 106 3
has 0 106 3
given 0 106 3
these 0 106 3
documents 0 106 3
a 0 106 3
particular 0 106 3
qualification 0 106 3
that 0 106 3
elevates 0 106 3
them 0 106 3
to 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
level 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
being 0 106 3
official 0 106 3
teachings 0 106 3
of 0 106 3
the 0 106 3
church. 0 106 3

While 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
content 0 106 4
of 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
pope’s 0 106 4
letter 0 106 4
itself 0 106 4
does 0 106 4
not 0 106 4
contain 0 106 4
teachings 0 106 4
on 0 106 4
faith 0 106 4
and 0 106 4
morals, 0 106 4
it 0 106 4
does 0 106 4
point 0 106 4
toward 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
interpretations 0 106 4
of 0 106 4
the 0 106 4
Argentine 0 106 4
bishops 0 106 4
and 0 106 4
confirms 0 106 4
them 0 106 4
as 0 106 4
authentically 0 106 4
reflecting 0 106 4
his 0 106 4
own 0 106 4
mind. 0 106 4

Thus 0 106 5
together 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
two 0 106 5
documents 0 106 5
became 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
Holy 0 106 5
Father’s 0 106 5
authentic 0 106 5
magisterium 0 106 5
for 0 106 5
the 0 106 5
whole 0 106 5
church.” 0 106 5

What 0 106 6
Cardinal 0 106 6
Burke 0 106 6
rightly 0 106 6
describes 0 106 6
as 0 106 6
lacking 1 106 6
in 1 106 6
any 1 106 6
magisterial 1 106 6
weight 1 106 6
whatsoever—and, 1 106 6
in 0 106 6
fact, 0 106 6
in 0 106 6
dire 0 106 6
need 0 106 6
of 0 106 6
clarification 0 106 6
and 0 106 6
correction— 0 106 6
has 0 106 6
by 0 106 6
papal 0 106 6
fiat 0 106 6
been 0 106 6
declared 0 106 6
magisterial, 0 106 6
and 0 106 6
thus 0 106 6
binding 0 106 6
on 0 106 6
us 0 106 6
all. 0 106 6

Francis 1 106 7
made 1 106 7
it 1 106 7
clear 1 106 7
that 1 106 7
the 1 106 7
Argentine 1 106 7
bishops’ 1 106 7
interpretation 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
AL 1 106 7
allowing 1 106 7
public 1 106 7
adulterers 1 106 7
to 1 106 7
receive 1 106 7
Holy 1 106 7
Communion 1 106 7
“explains 1 106 7
precisely 1 106 7
the 1 106 7
meaning 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
Chapter 1 106 7
VIII 1 106 7
of 1 106 7
‘Amoris 1 106 7
Laetitia.’ 1 106 7
There 1 106 7
are 1 106 7
no 1 106 7
other 1 106 7
interpretations.” 1 106 7

I 0 106 8
would 0 106 8
imagine 0 106 8
this 0 106 8
outrageous 1 106 8
overreach 1 106 8
of 1 106 8
papal 1 106 8
authority 1 106 8
on 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
Pope's 0 106 8
part 0 106 8
would 0 106 8
make 0 106 8
it 0 106 8
ominously 1 106 8
clear 1 106 8
to 0 106 8
Cardinal 0 106 8
Burke 0 106 8
that 0 106 8
the 0 106 8
time 0 106 8
has 0 106 8
come 0 106 8
to 0 106 8
issue 0 106 8

public 0 106 8
correction 0 106 8
of 0 106 8
Pope 0 106 8
Francis's 0 106 8
erroneous 0 106 8
teaching. 0 106 8

The 0 106 9
moment, 0 106 9
it 0 106 9
would 0 106 9
seem, 0 106 9
has 0 106 9
come. 0 106 9

Cardinal 0 106 10
Burke, 0 106 10
please 0 106 10
and 0 106 10
in 0 106 10
God's 1 106 10
Holy 1 106 10
Name, 1 106 10
we 1 106 10
beg 1 106 10
you 1 106 10
to 1 106 10
act 1 106 10
now 1 106 10
-- 1 106 10
before 1 106 10
Pope 1 106 10
Francis 1 106 10
succeeds 1 106 10
in 1 106 10
tearing 1 106 10

half 1 106 10

fear 0 106 11
that 0 106 11
your 0 106 11
silence 0 106 11
now, 0 106 11

this 1 106 11
latest 1 106 11

travesty, 1 106 11
may 0 106 11
suggest 0 106 11
consent 0 106 11
to 0 106 11
the 0 106 11
claim 0 106 11
that 0 106 11
Amoris 0 106 11
Laetitia 0 106 11
is 0 106 11
magisterial, 0 106 11
and 0 106 11
thus 0 106 11
prove 0 106 11
more 0 106 11
damaging 0 106 11
than 0 106 11

the 0 65 4

the 0 65 4
major 0 65 4
U.S. 0 65 4

in 0 65 4
Syria, 0 65 4
is 0 65 4
an 0 65 4
arm 0 65 4
of 0 65 4
the 0 65 4
Kurdish 0 65 4
PKK 0 65 4
in 0 65 4
Turkey, 0 65 4
which 0 65 4
we 0 65 4
and 0 65 4
the 0 65 4
Turks 0 65 4
have 0 65 4
designated 0 65 4
as 0 65 4
a 0 65 4
terrorist 0 65 4
organization. 0 65 4

While 0 65 5
the 0 65 5

most 0 65 5

Now 0 65 11
that 0 65 11

is 0 65 13
now 0 65 13
open-ended. 0 65 13

Our 0 65 14
goals: 0 65 14
Guarantee 0 65 14
al-Qaida 0 65 14
and 0 65 14
ISIS 0 65 14
do 0 65 14
not 0 65 14

set 0 65 14
up 0 65 14

regime. 0 65 14

But 1 65 15
who 1 65 15
authorized 1 65 15
this 1 65 15
strategic 1 65 15
commitment, 1 65 15
of 0 65 15
indefinite 0 65 15
duration, 0 65 15
in 0 65 15
Syria, 0 65 15
when 0 65 15

again, 0 65 16
the 0 65 16

the 0 65 19
Turks 0 65 19

them 0 65 19
as 0 65 19
terrorists? 0 65 19

Are 1 65 20
we 1 65 20
prepared 1 65 20
for 1 65 20
a 1 65 20
shooting 1 65 20

The 0 65 21
U.S. 0 65 21

in 0 65 21
Syria 0 65 21
said 0 65 21
this 0 65 21
week 0 65 21
the 0 65 21

Remarkable: 0 65 22
A 0 65 22
U.S.-created 0 65 22

Iraq, 0 65 22
over 0 65 22
Syria's 0 65 22
objections. 0 65 22

And 0 65 23
the 0 65 23
U.S. 0 65 23
military 0 65 23
will 0 65 23
stand 0 65 23
behind 0 65 23
the 0 65 23

Are 1 65 24
the 1 65 24
2,000 1 65 24

in 1 65 24
Syria 1 65 24
really 1 65 24
up 1 65 24
to 1 65 24
that 1 65 24
task, 1 65 24
should 0 65 24
the 0 65 24

Who 0 65 25
sanctioned 0 65 25
this 0 65 25
commitment 0 65 25
to 0 65 25
a 0 65 25
new 0 65 25

all 0 65 25
back 0 65 25
down, 0 65 25
risks 1 65 25
a 1 65 25

with 1 65 25
no 1 65 25

the 1 65 25
Kurds? 1 65 25

As 0 65 26
for 0 65 26
Syria's 0 65 26
Kurds 0 65 26
casting 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
lot 0 65 26
with 0 65 26
the 0 65 26
Americans, 0 65 26
one 0 65 26
wonders: 0 65 26
Did 0 65 26
they 0 65 26
not 0 65 26
observe 0 65 26
what 0 65 26
happened 0 65 26
when 0 65 26
their 0 65 26

cousins, 0 65 26
after 0 65 26
helping 0 65 26

drive 0 65 26
ISIS 0 65 26
out 0 65 26
of 0 65 26
Mosul, 0 65 26

Kirkuk 0 65 26
by 0 65 26
the 0 65 26

army, 0 65 26
as 0 65 26
their 0 65 26
U.S. 0 65 26
allies 0 65 26
watched? 0 65 26

In 0 65 27
the 0 65 27
six-year 0 65 27
Syrian 0 65 27
civil 0 65 27
war, 0 65 27
which 0 65 27
may 0 65 27
be 0 65 27
about 0 65 27
to 0 65 27
enter 0 65 27
a 0 65 27
new 0 65 27
phase, 0 65 27
America 0 65 27
faces 0 65 27
a 0 65 27
familiar 0 65 27
situation. 0 65 27

While 0 65 28
our 0 65 28
"allies" 0 65 28
and 0 65 28
adversaries 0 65 28
have 0 65 28
vital 0 65 28
interests 0 65 28
there, 0 65 28
we 0 65 28
do 0 65 28
not. 0 65 28

The 0 65 29
Assads 0 65 29
have 0 65 29
been 0 65 29
in 0 65 29
power 0 65 29
for 0 65 29
the 0 65 29
lifetime 0 65 29
of 0 65 29
most 0 65 29
Americans. 0 65 29

And 0 65 30
we 0 65 30
Americans 0 65 30
have 0 65 30
never 0 65 30
shown 0 65 30
a 0 65 30
desire 0 65 30
to 0 65 30
fight 0 65 30
there. 0 65 30

Assad 0 65 31
has 0 65 31
a 0 65 31
vital 0 65 31
interest: 0 65 31
preservation 0 65 31
of 0 65 31
his 0 65 31
family 0 65 31
regime 0 65 31
and 0 65 31
the 0 65 31
reunification 0 65 31
of 0 65 31
his 0 65 31
country. 0 65 31

The 0 65 32
Turks 0 65 32
have 0 65 32
a 0 65 32
vital 0 65 32
interest 0 65 32
in 0 65 32
keeping 0 65 32

minority, 0 65 32
which 0 65 32
seeks 0 65 32
greater 0 65 32
independence. 0 65 32

The 0 65 33
Israelis 0 65 33
and 0 65 33
Saudi 0 65 33
royals 0 65 33
want 0 65 33
the 0 65 33

to 0 65 33
keep 0 65 33

The 0 65 34
U.S. 0 65 34

Party 0 65 34
wants 0 65 34
us 0 65 34

By 0 132 8
contrast, 0 132 8
Barack 0 132 8
Obama 0 132 8
and 0 132 8
his 0 132 8
obsequious 1 132 8
acolytes 1 132 8
were 0 132 8
besotted 0 132 8
by 0 132 8
the 0 132 8
prospect 0 132 8
of 0 132 8
forging 0 132 8

with 0 132 8

despotic 1 132 8
mullahs 1 132 8
of 0 132 8
the 0 132 8
Islamic 0 132 8
Republic. 0 132 8

His 0 132 9
administration 0 132 9
remained 0 132 9
largely 0 132 9
silent 0 132 9
when 0 132 9
Iranians 0 132 9
took 0 132 9
to 0 132 9
the 0 132 9
streets 0 132 9
in 0 132 9
2009 0 132 9
to 0 132 9
protest 0 132 9
a 0 132 9
rigged 0 132 9
election. 0 132 9

Some 0 132 10
have 0 132 10
speculated 0 132 10
that 0 132 10
his 0 132 10
administration 0 132 10
missed 0 132 10
out 0 132 10
on 0 132 10

prime 0 132 10
opportunity 0 132 10
for 0 132 10

It 0 132 11
was 0 132 11
only 0 132 11
downhill 0 132 11
from 0 132 11
there. 0 132 11

In 0 132 12
a 0 132 12
misguided 1 132 12
effort 1 132 12
to 0 132 12

selling 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
American 0 132 13
people 0 132 13
on 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
naïve 0 132 13
notion 0 132 13
that 0 132 13
there 0 132 13
were 0 132 13

of 0 132 13
import 0 132 13
in 0 132 13

ignoring 0 132 13
the 0 132 13
obvious 0 132 13
fact 0 132 13
that 0 132 13
all 0 132 13

In 0 132 23

to 0 132 23

the 0 132 23
Gulf, 0 132 23
the 0 132 23

for 0 132 24
that 0 132 24
matter 0 132 24
America’s 0 132 24
military 0 132 24
might, 0 132 24
is 0 132 24
only 0 132 24
as 0 132 24
effective 0 132 24
as 0 132 24
the 0 132 24
political 0 132 24
leadership 0 132 24
that 0 132 24
commands 0 132 24

Chief 0 132 24
of 0 132 24
the 0 132 24

On 0 132 25
the 0 132 25
contrary, 0 132 25
the 0 132 25
Iranians 0 132 25
correctly 0 132 25
viewed 0 132 25
him 0 132 25
as 0 132 25
weak, 1 132 25
indecisive 1 132 25
and 1 132 25
ineffectual. 1 132 25

On 0 132 26
his 0 132 26
watch, 0 132 26
American 0 132 26
warships 0 132 26
patrolling 0 132 26
the 0 132 26
Gulf 0 132 26

with 0 132 26
near 0 132 26
impunity. 0 132 26

At 0 132 27
times 0 132 27
Iranian 0 132 27
naval 0 132 27

The 0 132 28
navy 0 132 28
termed 0 132 28
these 0 132 28
near 0 132 28
ritualistic, 1 132 28
belligerent 1 132 28
encounters, 1 132 28
“unsafe 0 132 28
and 0 132 28
unprofessional.” 0 132 28

Iranian 0 132 29
arrogance 0 132 29
and 0 132 29
impudence 0 132 29
reached 0 132 29
its 0 132 29
zenith 0 132 29
with 0 132 29
the 0 132 29
January 0 132 29
12th 0 132 29
2016 0 132 29
seizure 0 132 29
of 0 132 29
two 0 132 29
American 0 132 29
riverine 0 132 29
command 0 132 29
boats 0 132 29
and 0 132 29
their 0 132 29
crews 0 132 29
near 0 132 29
Farsi 0 132 29
Island. 0 132 29

The 0 132 30
RCBs 0 132 30
and 0 132 30
crews 0 132 30
manning 0 132 30
them 0 132 30
were 0 132 30
returned 0 132 30
some 0 132 30
16 0 132 30
hours 0 132 30
later 0 132 30
but 0 132 30
not 0 132 30
before 0 132 30
the 0 132 30
Iranians 0 132 30
stole 0 132 30
two 0 132 30
satellite 0 132 30
phone 0 132 30
sim 0 132 30
cards, 0 132 30
likely 0 132 30
containing 0 132 30
classified 0 132 30
information, 0 132 30
as 0 132 30
well 0 132 30
as 0 132 30
thousands 0 132 30
of 0 132 30
pages 0 132 30
of 0 132 30
information 0 132 30
downloaded 0 132 30
from 0 132 30

and 0 132 30
maps 0 132 30
used 0 132 30
by 0 132 30
the 0 132 30
sailors. 0 132 30

Ironically, 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
seizure 0 132 31
occurred 0 132 31
on 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
very 0 132 31
day 0 132 31
that 0 132 31
Obama 0 132 31
was 0 132 31
to 0 132 31
give 0 132 31
his 0 132 31
State 0 132 31
of 0 132 31
the 0 132 31
Union 0 132 31
address 0 132 31
but 0 132 31
predictably, 0 132 31
he 1 132 31
didn’t 1 132 31
think 1 132 31
that 1 132 31
the 1 132 31
seizure 1 132 31
of 1 132 31
Americans 1 132 31
was 1 132 31
important 1 132 31
enough 1 132 31
to 1 132 31
note. 1 132 31

But 0 132 32
according 0 132 32
to 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
Navy, 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
past 0 132 32
five 0 132 32
months 0 132 32
have 0 132 32
witnessed 0 132 32
markedly 0 132 32
less 0 132 32
belligerent 0 132 32
conduct 0 132 32
from 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
Iranians, 0 132 32
leaving 0 132 32
Navy 0 132 32
officials 0 132 32
baffled 0 132 32
by 0 132 32
the 0 132 32
sudden 0 132 32
positive 0 132 32
change 0 132 32
in 0 132 32
attitude. 0 132 32

In 0 132 33
fact, 0 132 33
Iran’s 0 132 33
attitude 0 132 33
adjustment 0 132 33
in 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Arabian 0 132 33
Gulf 0 132 33
is 0 132 33
no 0 132 33
mystery 0 132 33
and 0 132 33
stems 0 132 33
from 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Trump 0 132 33
administration’s 0 132 33
implementation 0 132 33
of 0 132 33
a 0 132 33
new 0 132 33
robust 0 132 33
foreign 0 132 33
policy 0 132 33
vis-à-vis 0 132 33
the 0 132 33
Islamic 0 132 33
Republic. 0 132 33

Soon 0 132 34
after 0 132 34
taking 0 132 34
office, 0 132 34
Trump 0 132 34
noted 0 132 34
that 0 132 34
“Iran 0 132 34
[was] 0 132 34
playing 0 132 34
with 0 132 34
fire” 0 132 34
and 0 132 34
added 0 132 34
that 0 132 34
he 0 132 34
wouldn’t 0 132 34
be 0 132 34
as 0 132 34
“kind” 0 132 34
to 0 132 34
the 0 132 34
mullahs 0 132 34
as 0 132 34
Obama 0 132 34
was. 0 132 34

This 0 132 35
wasn’t 0 132 35
empty 1 132 35
rhetoric. 1 132 35

It 0 132 36
was 0 132 36
backed 0 132 36
up 0 132 36
by 0 132 36
tangible 0 132 36
action. 0 132 36

Additional 0 132 37
sanctions 0 132 37
were 0 132 37
imposed 0 132 37
against 0 132 37
Iran 0 132 37
for 0 132 37
acting 0 132 37
in 0 132 37
defiance 0 132 37
of 0 132 37

Douthat 0 137 6
laid 0 137 6
out 0 137 6
three 0 137 6

Faggioli, 0 137 9
meanwhile, 0 137 9
outlined 0 137 9
a 1 137 9
genuinely 1 137 9
surprising 1 137 9
position. 1 137 9

Rather 0 137 10
than 0 137 10
making 0 137 10
a 0 137 10
straightforward 0 137 10
case 0 137 10
for 0 137 10
why 0 137 10
Pope 0 137 10
Francis 0 137 10
has 0 137 10
changed 0 137 10
the 0 137 10
Church 0 137 10
for 0 137 10
the 0 137 10
better, 0 137 10
Faggioli 0 137 10
rejected 0 137 10
the 0 137 10
possibility 0 137 10
of 0 137 10
evaluating 0 137 10
his 0 137 10
papacy 0 137 10
in 0 137 10
terms 0 137 10
of 0 137 10
“continuity” 0 137 10
with 0 137 10
past 0 137 10
popes, 0 137 10
since 0 137 10
doing 0 137 10
so 0 137 10
would 0 137 10
assume 0 137 10
that 0 137 10
“Christianity 0 137 10
at 0 137 10
some 0 137 10
point 0 137 10
. 0 137 10

. 0 137 11

. 0 137 12

was 0 137 13
complete,” 0 137 13
which 0 137 13
Faggioli 0 137 13
does 0 137 13
not 0 137 13
think 0 137 13
is 0 137 13
true. 0 137 13

While 0 137 14
I 0 137 14
emphatically 0 137 14
disagree 0 137 14
with 0 137 14
this 0 137 14
argument, 0 137 14
I 0 137 14
have 0 137 14
to 0 137 14
hand 0 137 14
it 0 137 14
to 0 137 14
Faggioli: 0 137 14
From 0 137 14
the 0 137 14
outset, 0 137 14
he 0 137 14
made 0 137 14
clear 0 137 14
that 0 137 14
he 0 137 14
was 0 137 14
not 0 137 14
planning 0 137 14
to 0 137 14
debate 0 137 14
Douthat 0 137 14
on 0 137 14
the 0 137 14
implications 0 137 14
of 0 137 14
the 0 137 14
Francis 0 137 14
papacy. 0 137 14

Instead, 0 137 15
through 0 137 15
a 1 137 15
combination 1 137 15
of 1 137 15
rhetorical 1 137 15
tricks 1 137 15
and 1 137 15
soft-peddled 1 137 15
Hegelianism, 1 137 15
he 0 137 15
would 0 137 15
completely 0 137 15
redefine 0 137 15
the 0 137 15
role 0 137 15
and 0 137 15
nature 0 137 15
of 0 137 15
the 0 137 15
Catholic 0 137 15
Church. 0 137 15

During 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
crux 0 137 16
of 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
debate 0 137 16
— 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
discussion 0 137 16
of 0 137 16
communion 0 137 16
for 0 137 16
the 0 137 16
divorced 0 137 16
and 0 137 16
remarried 0 137 16
— 0 137 16
Faggioli 0 137 16
raised 0 137 16
his 1 137 16
most 1 137 16
theologically 1 137 16
unsettling 1 137 16
point. 1 137 16

To 0 137 17
defend 0 137 17
his 0 137 17
position 0 137 17
that 0 137 17
remarried 0 137 17
persons 0 137 17
should 0 137 17
be 0 137 17
able 0 137 17
to 0 137 17
receive 0 137 17
communion, 0 137 17
Faggioli 0 137 17
invoked 0 137 17
the 0 137 17
case 0 137 17
of 0 137 17
Germany, 0 137 17
where 0 137 17
50 0 137 17
percent 0 137 17
of 0 137 17
Catholic 0 137 17
marriages 0 137 17
end 0 137 17
in 0 137 17
divorce. 0 137 17

For 1 137 18
Faggioli, 1 137 18
the 1 137 18
implication 1 137 18
is 1 137 18
that 1 137 18
at 1 137 18
least 1 137 18
50 1 137 18
percent 1 137 18
of 1 137 18
German 1 137 18
Catholic 1 137 18
children 1 137 18
never 1 137 18
see 1 137 18
their 1 137 18
parents 1 137 18
receive 1 137 18
communion 1 137 18
and 1 137 18
lose 1 137 18
their 1 137 18
faith 1 137 18
because 1 137 18
of 1 137 18
it. 1 137 18

This, 0 137 19
he 0 137 19
says, 0 137 19
is 0 137 19
“bad 1 137 19
for 1 137 19
evangelization,” 1 137 19
and 0 137 19
in 0 137 19
order 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
keep 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
pews 0 137 19
full, 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
Church’s 0 137 19
role 0 137 19
should 0 137 19
not 0 137 19
be 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
deny 0 137 19
communion 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
divorced 0 137 19
and 0 137 19
remarried, 0 137 19
but 0 137 19
instead 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
ask, 0 137 19
“What 0 137 19
can 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
Catholic 0 137 19
Church 0 137 19
do 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
make 0 137 19
the 0 137 19
faithful 0 137 19
able 0 137 19
to 0 137 19
receive 0 137 19
sacraments?” 0 137 19

Advertisement 0 137 20

This 0 137 21
is 0 137 21
a 1 137 21
lovely 1 137 21
suggestion, 1 137 21
and 0 137 21
one 0 137 21
that 0 137 21
I’m 0 137 21
not 0 137 21
entirely 0 137 21
unsympathetic 0 137 21
to. 0 137 21

However, 0 137 22
the 0 137 22
fact 0 137 22
remains 0 137 22
that 0 137 22
Faggioli 0 137 22
is 0 137 22
suggesting 0 137 22
the 0 137 22
Church 0 137 22
do 0 137 22
much 0 137 22
more 0 137 22
than 0 137 22
provide 0 137 22
sacraments 0 137 22
to 0 137 22
the 0 137 22
faithful. 0 137 22

Just 0 137 23
before 0 137 23
invoking 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
German 0 137 23
case, 0 137 23
Faggioli 0 137 23
characterized 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
country 0 137 23
as 0 137 23
one 0 137 23
of 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
most 0 137 23
secular 0 137 23
in 0 137 23
the 0 137 23
world. 0 137 23

But 0 137 24
rather 0 137 24
than 0 137 24
lamenting 0 137 24
what 0 137 24
secularism 0 137 24
has 0 137 24
wrought 0 137 24
on 0 137 24
marital 0 137 24
life 0 137 24
in 0 137 24
Germany, 0 137 24
reasserting 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
Church’s 0 137 24
position 0 137 24
on 0 137 24
marriage, 0 137 24
and 0 137 24
insisting 0 137 24
that 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
faithful 0 137 24
strive 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
live 0 137 24
according 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
her 0 137 24
laws, 0 137 24
Faggioli 0 137 24
argues 0 137 24
that 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
Church 0 137 24
ought 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
bend 0 137 24
to 0 137 24
the 0 137 24
will 0 137 24
of 0 137 24
secular 0 137 24
society. 0 137 24

It 0 137 26
should 0 137 26
be 0 137 26
clear 0 137 26
to 0 137 26
anyone, 0 137 26
not 0 137 26
just 0 137 26
practicing 0 137 26
Catholics, 0 137 26
that 0 137 26
this 0 137 26
is 0 137 26
absurd. 0 137 26

If 0 137 27
the 0 137 27
Church 0 137 27
exists 0 137 27
simply 0 137 27
to 0 137 27
accommodate 0 137 27
the 0 137 27

and 0 137 27

is 0 137 27
the 0 137 27
point 0 137 27
of 0 137 27

of 0 137 28
“accommodation” 0 137 28
Faggioli 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
calling 0 137 28
for, 0 137 28
writing 0 137 28
that 0 137 28
when 0 137 28
“the 0 137 28
people 0 137 28
cannot 0 137 28
cope” 0 137 28
with 0 137 28
God, 0 137 28
they 0 137 28
“bring 0 137 28
him 0 137 28
down 0 137 28
into 0 137 28
their 0 137 28
own 0 137 28
world,” 0 137 28
and 0 137 28
insist 0 137 28
that 0 137 28
“he 0 137 28
must 0 137 28
be 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
kind 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
God 0 137 28
that 0 137 28
[they 0 137 28
need].” 0 137 28
In 0 137 28
other 0 137 28
words, 0 137 28
“Man 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
using 0 137 28
God, 0 137 28
and, 0 137 28
in 0 137 28
reality, 0 137 28
even 0 137 28
if 0 137 28
it 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
not 0 137 28
outwardly 0 137 28
discernible, 0 137 28
he 0 137 28
is 0 137 28
placing 0 137 28
himself 0 137 28
above 0 137 28
God.” 0 137 28
To 0 137 28
fully 0 137 28
drive 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
point 0 137 28
home, 0 137 28
Benedict 0 137 28
equates 0 137 28
this 0 137 28
kind 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
worship 0 137 28
with 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
Israelites 0 137 28
desert 0 137 28
worship 0 137 28
of 0 137 28
the 0 137 28
bull 0 137 28
calf. 0 137 28

Unsurprisingly, 0 137 29
this 0 137 29
progressive 0 137 29
interpretation 0 137 29
of 0 137 29
Catholic 0 137 29
doctrine 0 137 29
eventually 0 137 29
reveals 0 137 29
itself 0 137 29
to 0 137 29
be 0 137 29
rank 1 137 29
historicism. 1 137 29

Throughout 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
debate, 0 137 30
Faggioli 0 137 30
drew 0 137 30
out 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
argument 0 137 30
that 0 137 30
allowing 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
remarried 0 137 30
to 0 137 30
receive 0 137 30
communion 0 137 30
would 0 137 30
not 0 137 30
represent 0 137 30
a 0 137 30
radical 0 137 30
change 0 137 30
in 0 137 30
doctrine 0 137 30
but 0 137 30
a 0 137 30
return 0 137 30
to 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
teachings 0 137 30
of 0 137 30
the 0 137 30
Gospel. 0 137 30

Eventually, 0 137 31
Douthat 0 137 31
drew 0 137 31
his 0 137 31
argument 0 137 31
to 0 137 31
its 0 137 31
logical 0 137 31
conclusion 0 137 31
with 0 137 31
this 0 137 31
question: 0 137 31
Were 1 137 31
priests 1 137 31
throughout 1 137 31
history 1 137 31
in 1 137 31
fact 1 137 31
misleading 1 137 31
their 1 137 31
divorced 1 137 31
and 1 137 31
remarried 1 137 31
parishioners 1 137 31
by 1 137 31
telling 1 137 31
them 1 137 31
they 1 137 31
could 1 137 31
not 1 137 31
receive 1 137 31
communion? 1 137 31

After 0 137 32
a 0 137 32
few 0 137 32
seconds’ 0 137 32
pause, 0 137 32
Faggioli 0 137 32
gave 0 137 32
the 0 137 32
only 0 137 32
answer 0 137 32
he 0 137 32
could: 0 137 32
“There 1 137 32
are 1 137 32
different 1 137 32
responses 1 137 32
to 1 137 32
the 1 137 32
same 1 137 32
question 1 137 32
in 1 137 32
different 1 137 32
times.” 1 137 32

Throughout 0 137 34
their 0 137 34
conversation, 0 137 34
both 0 137 34
Douthat 0 137 34
and 0 137 34
Faggioli 0 137 34
repeatedly 0 137 34
observed 0 137 34
that 0 137 34
the 0 137 34
debate 0 137 34
over 0 137 34
Pope 0 137 34
Francis 0 137 34
and 0 137 34
the 0 137 34
future 0 137 34
of 0 137 34
the 0 137 34
Church 0 137 34
is 0 137 34
carried 0 137 34
on 0 137 34
primarily 0 137 34
among 0 137 34
Catholic 0 137 34
intellectuals, 0 137 34
unbeknownst 0 137 34
to 0 137 34
most 0 137 34
of 0 137 34
“the 0 137 34
flock.” 0 137 34

Advertisement 0 137 35

It 0 137 36
strikes 0 137 36
me, 0 137 36
however, 0 137 36
that 0 137 36
everybody 0 137 36
— 0 137 36
Catholic 0 137 36
or 0 137 36
not 0 137 36
— 0 137 36
has 1 137 36
a 1 137 36
dog 1 137 36
in 1 137 36
this 1 137 36
fight, 1 137 36
which 0 137 36
is 0 137 36
about 0 137 36
more 0 137 36
than 0 137 36
communion 0 137 36
and 0 137 36
canon 0 137 36
law. 0 137 36

At 0 137 37
its 0 137 37
core, 0 137 37
this 0 137 37
debate 0 137 37
is 0 137 37
about 0 137 37
truth 0 137 37
and 0 137 37
our 0 137 37
ability 0 137 37
to 0 137 37
judge 0 137 37
right 0 137 37
from 0 137 37
wrong. 0 137 37

Could 1 137 38
we 1 137 38
possibly 1 137 38
say, 1 137 38
for 1 137 38
instance, 1 137 38
that 1 137 38
it’s 1 137 38
impossible 1 137 38
to 1 137 38
judge 1 137 38
the 1 137 38
presidency 1 137 38
of 1 137 38
Donald 1 137 38
Trump 1 137 38
relative 1 137 38
to 1 137 38
past 1 137 38
presidents? 1 137 38

Of 0 137 39
course 0 137 39
not 0 137 39
— 0 137 39
that 0 137 39
would 0 137 39
be 0 137 39
preposterous, 0 137 39
as 0 137 39
I’m 0 137 39
sure 0 137 39
Faggioli 0 137 39
would 0 137 39
agree. 0 137 39

To 0 137 40
pass 0 137 40
moral 0 137 40
judgements 0 137 40
on 0 137 40
papacies, 0 137 40
presidencies, 0 137 40
or 0 137 40
anything 0 137 40
else, 0 137 40
we 0 137 40
must 0 137 40
have 0 137 40
recourse 0 137 40
to 0 137 40
truth, 0 137 40
and 0 137 40
to 0 137 40
the 0 137 40
institutions 0 137 40
that 0 137 40
have 0 137 40
upheld 0 137 40
this 0 137 40
truth 0 137 40
for 0 137 40
centuries. 0 137 40

Whether 0 137 41
in 0 137 41
the 0 137 41
Church 0 137 41
or 0 137 41
in 0 137 41
the 0 137 41
academy, 0 137 41
we 0 137 41
must 0 137 41
resist 0 137 41
this 0 137 41
dangerous 0 137 41
historicist 0 137 41
impulse. 0 137 41

If 1 137 42
we 1 137 42
don’t, 1 137 42
we 1 137 42
will 1 137 42
find 1 137 42
ourselves, 1 137 42
in 1 137 42
the 1 137 42
words 1 137 42
of 1 137 42
Pope 1 137 42
Benedict, 1 137 42
in 1 137 42
“a 1 137 42
dictatorship 1 137 42
of 1 137 42
relativism 1 137 42
that 1 137 42
does 1 137 42
not 1 137 42
recognize 1 137 42
anything 1 137 42
as 1 137 42
definitive 1 137 42
and 1 137 42
whose 1 137 42
ultimate 1 137 42
goal 1 137 42
consists 1 137 42
solely 1 137 42

Saviano 0 174 19
said 0 174 19
the 0 174 19
commission 0 174 19
is 0 174 19
“a 0 174 19
good 0 174 19
idea,” 0 174 19
and 0 174 19
added, 0 174 19
“I’m 0 174 19

that 0 174 19

but 0 174 19
a 0 174 19

“That’s 0 174 21
kind 0 174 21
of 0 174 21
my 0 174 21
attitude 0 174 21
now: 0 174 21
If 1 174 21
I 1 174 21
don’t 1 174 21

Church 1 174 21
to 1 174 21

“hopeful 0 174 26

“My 0 174 27

will 0 174 27
probably 0 174 27
have 0 174 27
the 0 174 27

because 0 174 27
the 0 174 27

it 0 174 27

they’re 0 174 27

on 0 174 29

“continues 1 174 29

A 0 222 1
couple 0 222 1
of 0 222 1
years 0 222 1
ago, 0 222 1
I 0 222 1
introduced 0 222 1
you 0 222 1
to 0 222 1
the 0 222 1
Hammon 0 222 1
family, 0 222 1
a 0 222 1
rancher 0 222 1
family 0 222 1
out 0 222 1
of 0 222 1
Oregon 0 222 1
that 0 222 1
was 0 222 1
targeted 0 222 1
after 0 222 1
the 0 222 1
patriarch 0 222 1
in 0 222 1
the 0 222 1
family 0 222 1
and 0 222 1
his 0 222 1
son 0 222 1
went 0 222 1
to 0 222 1
jail 0 222 1
for 0 222 1
doing 0 222 1
what 0 222 1
ranchers 0 222 1
do, 0 222 1
setting 0 222 1
fires 0 222 1
to 0 222 1
protect 0 222 1
property 0 222 1

However, 0 222 2
in 0 222 2
the 0 222 2
day 0 222 2
and 0 222 2
age 0 222 2
of 0 222 2
unmitigated 0 222 2
"terrorism" 0 222 2

once 0 222 2
they 0 222 2
served 0 222 2
their 0 222 2

federal 0 222 2

both 0 222 2
men 0 222 2
for 0 222 2
more 0 222 2

Their 0 222 3
story 0 222 3
ultimately 0 222 3
led 0 222 3
to 0 222 3
the 0 222 3
Malheur 0 222 3

where 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
differences 0 224 4
between 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
two 0 224 4

the 0 224 4
Catholic 0 224 4

of 0 224 4
Christ 0 224 4
and 0 224 4
the 0 224 4
Bergoglian/Kasperian 0 224 4
programme 0 224 4
- 0 224 4
are 0 224 4
more 0 224 4
sharply 0 224 4
contrasted. 0 224 4

One 0 224 5
aspect 0 224 5
of 0 224 5
Pope 0 224 5
Francis’ 0 224 5
character 0 224 5
that 0 224 5
seems 0 224 5
little-explored 0 224 5
by 0 224 5
the 0 224 5
Catholic 0 224 5
and 0 224 5
secular 0 224 5
media 0 224 5
alike 0 224 5
is 0 224 5
his 0 224 5
apparent 0 224 5
disdain 0 224 5
for 0 224 5
contemplative 0 224 5
religious 0 224 5
life 0 224 5
– 0 224 5
a 0 224 5
facet 0 224 5
of 0 224 5
Catholic 0 224 5
life 0 224 5
that 0 224 5
could 0 224 5
be 0 224 5
described 0 224 5
as 0 224 5
the 0 224 5
most 0 224 5
purely 0 224 5
religious 0 224 5
of 0 224 5
all 0 224 5
the 0 224 5
Church’s 0 224 5
undertakings. 0 224 5

The 0 224 6
world 0 224 6
does 0 224 6
not 0 224 6
understand 0 224 6
it 0 224 6
or 0 224 6
want 0 224 6
it. 0 224 6

Therefore, 0 224 7
it 0 224 7
is 0 224 7
something 0 224 7
of 0 224 7
a 0 224 7
thorn 0 224 7
in 0 224 7
the 0 224 7
Bergoglian 0 224 7
side, 0 224 7
and 0 224 7
he 0 224 7
has 0 224 7
repeatedly 0 224 7
expressed 0 224 7
his 0 224 7
contempt 0 224 7
for 0 224 7
it. 0 224 7

So 0 224 8
when, 0 224 8
in 0 224 8
2016 0 224 8
he 0 224 8
issued 0 224 8
a 0 224 8
document 0 224 8
on 0 224 8
contemplative 0 224 8
nuns, 0 224 8
the 0 224 8
faithful 0 224 8
braced 0 224 8
for 0 224 8
impact 0 224 8
. 0 224 8

In 0 224 9
his 0 224 9
recent 0 224 9
document, 0 224 9
ostensibly 0 224 9
on 0 224 9
holiness, 0 224 9
“Gaudete 0 224 9
et 0 224 9
Exultate,” 0 224 9
the 0 224 9
pope 0 224 9
attacked 1 224 9
the 0 224 9
religious 0 224 9
desire 0 224 9
for 0 224 9
silence 0 224 9
and 0 224 9
solitude, 0 224 9
to 0 224 9
be 0 224 9
alone 0 224 9
with 0 224 9
God 0 224 9
in 0 224 9
prayer, 0 224 9
seeking 0 224 9
unity 0 224 9
with 0 224 9
Him, 0 224 9
saying 0 224 9
in 0 224 9
essence 0 224 9
that 0 224 9
the 0 224 9
Christian 0 224 9
life 0 224 9
is 0 224 9
inherently 0 224 9
about 0 224 9
social 0 224 9
activism, 0 224 9
about 0 224 9
material, 0 224 9
worldly 0 224 9
ends. 0 224 9

To 0 224 10
these 0 224 10
foundations 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
the 0 224 10
contemplative 0 224 10
life 0 224 10
– 0 224 10
indeed 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
any 0 224 10
form 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
religious 0 224 10
life 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
the 0 224 10
Church 0 224 10
– 0 224 10
Francis 0 224 10
set 0 224 10
up 0 224 10
another 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
his 0 224 10
false 1 224 10
dichotomies, 0 224 10
contemplation 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
opposition 0 224 10
to 0 224 10
serving 0 224 10
others, 0 224 10
giving 0 224 10
a 0 224 10
Jesuit 0 224 10
maxim 0 224 10
as 0 224 10
an 0 224 10
imperative 0 224 10
for 0 224 10
all 0 224 10
Catholics: 0 224 10
“We 0 224 10
are 0 224 10
called 0 224 10
to 0 224 10
be 0 224 10
contemplatives 0 224 10
even 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
the 0 224 10
midst 0 224 10
of 0 224 10
action, 0 224 10
and 0 224 10
to 0 224 10
grow 0 224 10
in 0 224 10
holiness 0 224 10
by 0 224 10
responsibly 0 224 10
and 0 224 10
generously 0 224 10
carrying 0 224 10
out 0 224 10
our 0 224 10
proper 0 224 10
mission.” 0 224 10

Italian 0 224 11
Vaticanist 0 224 11
Marco 0 224 11
Tosatti 0 224 11
commented 0 224 11
dryly, 0 224 11
“Rejoice 0 224 11
and 0 224 11
be 0 224 11
glad… 0 224 11
but 0 224 11
not 0 224 11
if 0 224 11
you’re 0 224 11
a 0 224 11
cloistered 0 224 11
contemplative.” 0 224 11

In 0 224 12
2016, 0 224 12
I 0 224 12
wrote 0 224 12
that 0 224 12
Francis’ 0 224 12
Apostolic 0 224 12
Constitution, 0 224 12
“Vultum 0 224 12
dei 0 224 12
quaerere” 0 224 12
was 0 224 12
in 0 224 12
some 0 224 12
respects 0 224 12
the 1 224 12
most 1 224 12
damaging 1 224 12
object 0 224 12
of 0 224 12
the 0 224 12
wrecking-ball 1 224 12
pontificate 0 224 12
to 0 224 12
date. 0 224 12

Unfortunately, 0 224 13
it 0 224 13
was 0 224 13
about 0 224 13
a 0 224 13
subject 0 224 13
that 0 224 13
the 0 224 13
world, 0 224 13
and 0 224 13
therefore 0 224 13
the 0 224 13
modern 0 224 13
Church, 0 224 13
cares 0 224 13
so 0 224 13
little 0 224 13
about 0 224 13
that 0 224 13
hardly 0 224 13
anyone 0 224 13
noticed. 0 224 13

Aimed 0 224 14
specifically 0 224 14
at 0 224 14
female 0 224 14
contemplative 0 224 14
religious, 0 224 14
the 0 224 14
document 0 224 14
threatened 0 224 14
that 0 224 14
in 0 224 14
a 0 224 14
year 0 224 14
or 0 224 14
so 0 224 14
another 0 224 14
would 0 224 14
be 0 224 14
forthcoming 0 224 14
laying 0 224 14
out 0 224 14
precisely 0 224 14
what 0 224 14
would 0 224 14
now 0 224 14
be 0 224 14
required 0 224 14
of 0 224 14
nuns 0 224 14
to 0 224 14
continue 0 224 14
in 0 224 14
their 0 224 14
vocations. 0 224 14

The 0 224 15
new 0 224 15
document 0 224 15
issued 0 224 15
last 0 224 15
week, 0 224 15
“Cor 0 224 15
orans,” 0 224 15
is 0 224 15
juridical, 0 224 15
that 0 224 15
is, 0 224 15
it 0 224 15
is 0 224 15
not 0 224 15
much 0 224 15
more 0 224 15
than 0 224 15
a 0 224 15
list 0 224 15
of 0 224 15
specific 0 224 15
norms, 0 224 15
or 0 224 15
rules 0 224 15
– 0 224 15
289 0 224 15
of 0 224 15
them! 0 224 15

– 0 224 16
that 0 224 16
all 0 224 16
communities 0 224 16
of 0 224 16
contemplative 0 224 16
nuns 0 224 16
must 0 224 16
now 0 224 16
follow. 0 224 16

One 0 224 17
odd 0 224 17
remark 0 224 17
in 0 224 17
article 0 224 17
19 0 224 17
is 0 224 17
maybe 0 224 17
the 0 224 17
most 0 224 17
succinct 0 224 17
description 0 224 17
of 0 224 17
the 0 224 17
direction 0 224 17
planned 0 224 17
for 0 224 17
contemplatives: 0 224 17

“A 0 224 18
monastery 0 224 18
of 0 224 18
nuns, 0 224 18
as 0 224 18
every 0 224 18
religious 0 224 18
house, 0 224 18
is 0 224 18
erected 0 224 18
while 0 224 18
keeping 0 224 18
in 0 224 18
mind 0 224 18
its 0 224 18
usefulness 0 224 18
for 0 224 18
the 0 224 18
Church 0 224 18
and 0 224 18
for 0 224 18
the 0 224 18
Institute.” 0 224 18
(emphasis 0 224 18
added) 0 224 18

Wait… 0 224 19
its 0 224 19
“usefulness”? 0 224 19

I 0 224 20
think 0 224 20
a 0 224 20
fair 0 224 20
question 0 224 20
for 0 224 20
the 0 224 20
Faithful 0 224 20
to 0 224 20
ask 0 224 20
this 0 224 20
Vatican 0 224 20
department 0 224 20
might 0 224 20
be, 0 224 20
“According 0 224 20
to 0 224 20
what 0 224 20
specific 0 224 20
criteria 0 224 20
is 0 224 20
a 0 224 20
monastery’s 0 224 20
‘usefulness’ 0 224 20
actually 0 224 20
determined?” 0 224 20

One 0 224 21
can’t 0 224 21
help 0 224 21
but 0 224 21
hearken 0 224 21
back 0 224 21
to 0 224 21
the 0 224 21
criteria 0 224 21
for 0 224 21
monasteries 0 224 21
that 0 224 21
were 0 224 21
allowed 0 224 21
to 0 224 21
survive 0 224 21
the 0 224 21
revolutionary 0 224 21
purges 0 224 21
in 0 224 21
18th 0 224 21
and 0 224 21
19th 0 224 21
century 0 224 21
Europe. 0 224 21

A 0 224 22
house 0 224 22
that 0 224 22
could 0 224 22
prove 0 224 22
to 0 224 22
the 0 224 22
secularists 0 224 22
that 0 224 22
it 0 224 22
was 0 224 22
“useful” 0 224 22
– 0 224 22
that 0 224 22
it 0 224 22
could 0 224 22
care 0 224 22
for 0 224 22
the 0 224 22
indigent 0 224 22
elderly, 0 224 22
teach 0 224 22
children 0 224 22
or 0 224 22
nurse 0 224 22
the 0 224 22
sick 0 224 22
– 0 224 22
would 0 224 22
be 0 224 22
allowed 0 224 22
to 0 224 22
continue. 0 224 22

Those 0 224 23
which 0 224 23
were 0 224 23
purely 0 224 23
contemplative 0 224 23
– 0 224 23
a 0 224 23
single-minded 0 224 23
devotion 0 224 23
to 0 224 23
the 0 224 23
adoration 0 224 23
of 0 224 23
God 0 224 23
– 0 224 23
were 0 224 23
closed. 0 224 23

It 0 224 24
is 0 224 24
not 0 224 24
an 0 224 24
insignificant 0 224 24
quirk 0 224 24
of 0 224 24
modern 0 224 24
history, 0 224 24
and 0 224 24
one 0 224 24
that 0 224 24
tells 0 224 24
us 0 224 24
much 0 224 24
about 0 224 24
the 0 224 24
nature 0 224 24
of 0 224 24
the 0 224 24
current 0 224 24
pontificate, 0 224 24
that 0 224 24
houses 0 224 24
of 0 224 24
contemplatives 0 224 24
are 0 224 24
always 0 224 24
attacked 0 224 24
by 0 224 24
secularist 0 224 24
regimes, 0 224 24
from 1 224 24
Henry 1 224 24
VIII 1 224 24
to 1 224 24
the 1 224 24
Soviet 1 224 24
Union. 1 224 24

Rupture? 0 224 25

What 0 224 26
rupture? 0 224 26

The 0 224 27
first 0 224 27
thing 0 224 27
Cor 0 224 27
orans 0 224 27
does 0 224 27
is 0 224 27
claim 0 224 27
continuity 0 224 27
with 0 224 27
both 0 224 27
pre 0 224 27
and 0 224 27
post-Vatican 0 224 27
II 0 224 27
theology. 0 224 27

In 0 224 28
the 0 224 28
Introduction, 0 224 28
it 0 224 28
seems 0 224 28
anxious 0 224 28
to 0 224 28
establish 0 224 28
a 0 224 28
“hermeneutic 0 224 28
of 0 224 28
continuity” 0 224 28
with 0 224 28
Pius 0 224 28
XII 0 224 28
and 0 224 28
his 0 224 28
document 0 224 28
Sponsa 0 224 28
Christi 0 224 28
Ecclesia 0 224 28
of 0 224 28
1950. 0 224 28

The 0 224 29
authors 0 224 29
insist 0 224 29
there 0 224 29
is 0 224 29
no 0 224 29
contradiction 0 224 29
between 0 224 29
the 0 224 29
two 0 224 29
– 0 224 29
except, 0 224 29
of 0 224 29
course, 0 224 29
where 0 224 29
there 0 224 29
are 0 224 29
contradictions 0 224 29
– 0 224 29
and 0 224 29
that 0 224 29
both 0 224 29
Pius 0 224 29
XII 0 224 29
and 0 224 29
Francis 0 224 29
are 0 224 29
keen 0 224 29
to 0 224 29
see 0 224 29
nuns 0 224 29
reaching 0 224 29
the 0 224 29
“aim 0 224 29
of 0 224 29
their 0 224 29
specific 0 224 29
vocation.” 0 224 29
It 0 224 29
describes 0 224 29
Francis 0 224 29
as 0 224 29
promulgating 0 224 29
this 0 224 29
document 0 224 29

In 0 224 30

Pope 0 224 30
Francis, 0 224 30
by 0 224 30

precise 0 224 30
content 0 224 30
tied 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
consecrated 0 224 30
life 0 224 30
in 0 224 30
general 0 224 30
and 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
the 0 224 30
monastic 0 224 30
tradition 0 224 30
in 0 224 30
particular, 0 224 30
but 0 224 30
he 0 224 30
did 0 224 30
not 0 224 30
intend 0 224 30
to 0 224 30
abrogate 0 224 30
Sponsa 0 224 30
Christi 0 224 30
Ecclesia 0 224 30
that 0 224 30
was 0 224 30
derogated 0 224 30
only 0 224 30
in 0 224 30
some 0 224 30
points. 0 224 30

As 0 224 31
a 0 224 31
consequence, 0 224 31
the 0 224 31
two 0 224 31
pontifical 0 224 31
documents 0 224 31
are 0 224 31
to 0 224 31
be 0 224 31
held 0 224 31
as 0 224 31
normative 0 224 31
in 0 224 31
force 0 224 31
for 0 224 31
monasteries 0 224 31
of 0 224 31
nuns 0 224 31
and 0 224 31
must 0 224 31
be 0 224 31
read 0 224 31
in 0 224 31
a 0 224 31
unitary 0 224 31
vision. 0 224 31

But 0 224 32
of 0 224 32
course, 0 224 32
the 0 224 32
entire 0 224 32
game 0 224 32
is 0 224 32
given 0 224 32
away 0 224 32
in 0 224 32
the 0 224 32
next 0 224 32
paragraph: 0 224 32

Pope 0 224 33
Francis, 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
wake 0 224 33
of 0 224 33

of 0 224 33
Pope 0 224 33
Pius 0 224 33

fruitful 1 224 33
path 0 224 33
taken 0 224 33
by 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
Church 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
last 0 224 33
decades, 0 224 33
in 0 224 33
the 0 224 33

of 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
teachings 0 224 33
of 0 224 33
the 0 224 33

considering 0 224 33
the 0 224 33
changed 0 224 33
socio-cultural 0 224 33
conditions. 0 224 33

Yes, 0 224 34
that’s 0 224 34
what 0 224 34
it 0 224 34
said. 0 224 34

Here’s 0 224 35
my 1 224 35
translation: 1 224 35

“The 0 224 36
Church’s 0 224 36
‘path’ 0 224 36
of 0 224 36
the 0 224 36
last 0 224 36
50 0 224 36
years 0 224 36
has 0 224 36
been 0 224 36
‘fruitful’. 1 224 36

How 0 224 37
do 0 224 37
you 0 224 37
know? 0 224 37

Because 0 224 38
we’re 0 224 38
telling 0 224 38
you 0 224 38
it 0 224 38
has.” 0 224 38

In 0 224 39
other 0 224 39
words, 0 224 39
there 0 224 39
have 0 224 39
been 0 224 39
absolutely 1 224 39
no 1 224 39
problems 1 224 39
whatever 1 224 39
with 0 224 39
the 0 224 39
direction 0 224 39
taken 0 224 39
either 0 224 39
by 0 224 39
the 0 224 39
Church 0 224 39
or 0 224 39
by 0 224 39
the 0 224 39
religious 0 224 39
life 0 224 39
since 0 224 39
Vatican 0 224 39
II. 0 224 39

Everything 0 224 40
that 0 224 40
has 0 224 40
happened 0 224 40
has 0 224 40
been 0 224 40
in 0 224 40
complete 1 224 40
and 1 224 40
perfect 1 224 40
continuity 0 224 40
between 0 224 40
the 0 224 40
Before 0 224 40
Church 0 224 40
and 0 224 40
the 0 224 40
After 0 224 40
Church; 0 224 40
there 0 224 40
has 0 224 40
been 0 224 40
no 0 224 40
rupture 0 224 40
or 0 224 40
break 0 224 40
with 0 224 40
the 0 224 40
past. 0 224 40

All 0 224 41
changes 0 224 41
undertaken 0 224 41
by 0 224 41
religious 0 224 41
houses 0 224 41
were 0 224 41
perfectly 1 224 41
legitimate 0 224 41
and 0 224 41
good 0 224 41
- 0 224 41
“fruitful” 1 224 41
if, 0 224 41
perhaps, 0 224 41
a 0 224 41
bit 0 224 41
“intense” 0 224 41
– 0 224 41
and 0 224 41
have 0 224 41
been 0 224 41
made 0 224 41
in 0 224 41
“light 0 224 41
of 0 224 41
the 0 224 41
teachings” 0 224 41
of 0 224 41
Vatican 0 224 41
II 0 224 41
and 0 224 41
“changed 0 224 41
socio-cultural 0 224 41
conditions.” 0 224 41
There 0 224 41
is, 0 224 41
therefore, 0 224 41
no 0 224 41
legitimate 0 224 41
reason 0 224 41
whatever 0 224 41
for 0 224 41
any 0 224 41
religious 0 224 41
house 0 224 41
to 0 224 41
attempt 0 224 41
to 0 224 41
“turn 0 224 41
back 0 224 41
the 0 224 41
clock” 0 224 41
to 0 224 41
the 0 224 41
pre-Vatican 0 224 41
II 0 224 41
norms 0 224 41
or 0 224 41
styles 0 224 41
of 0 224 41
religious 0 224 41
life. 0 224 41

Anyone 1 224 42
attempting 1 224 42
to 1 224 42
do 1 224 42
this 1 224 42
are 1 224 42
Bad 1 224 42
Nuns 1 224 42
[insert 0 224 42
string 0 224 42
of 0 224 42
incomprehensible 0 224 42
papal 0 224 42
insults 0 224 42
here.] 0 224 42

This 0 224 43
is 0 224 43
what 0 224 43
might 0 224 43
be 0 224 43
considered 0 224 43
the 0 224 43
guiding 0 224 43
principle 0 224 43
of 0 224 43
the 0 224 43
document; 0 224 43
“Nothing 0 224 43
to 0 224 43
see 0 224 43
here. 0 224 43

And 0 224 44
if 0 224 44
you 0 224 44
say 0 224 44
there 0 224 44
is, 0 224 44
you’re 0 224 44
the 0 224 44
problem.” 0 224 44

Of 0 224 45
course, 0 224 45
this 0 224 45
kind 0 224 45
of 0 224 45
bold 0 224 45
proclamation 0 224 45
is 0 224 45
very 0 224 45
much 0 224 45
in 0 224 45
keeping 0 224 45
with 0 224 45
the 0 224 45
habit 0 224 45
of 0 224 45
this 0 224 45
pontificate 0 224 45
to 0 224 45
simply 0 224 45
claim 0 224 45
there 0 224 45
are 0 224 45
no 0 224 45
problems 0 224 45
and 0 224 45
become 0 224 45
gravely 1 224 45
offended 1 224 45
and 1 224 45
outraged 1 224 45
when 0 224 45
the 0 224 45
contrary 0 224 45
is 0 224 45
pointed 0 224 45
out. 0 224 45

It’s 0 224 46
your 0 224 46
fault 0 224 46
if 0 224 46
you 0 224 46
find 0 224 46
contradictions, 0 224 46
not 0 224 46
theirs; 0 224 46
they’ve 0 224 46
said 0 224 46
there 0 224 46
are 0 224 46
no 0 224 46
contradictions, 0 224 46
therefore 0 224 46
there 0 224 46
aren’t 0 224 46
any. 0 224 46

After 0 224 47
all, 0 224 47
this 0 224 47
is 0 224 47
the 0 224 47
papacy 0 224 47
where 0 224 47
2 0 224 47
+ 0 224 47
2 0 224 47
= 0 224 47
5 0 224 47
if 0 224 47
the 0 224 47
pope 0 224 47
says 0 224 47
it 0 224 47
does. 0 224 47

The 0 224 48
irony, 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
course, 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
built 0 224 48
in, 0 224 48
since 0 224 48
this 0 224 48
document 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
intended 0 224 48
as 0 224 48
a 0 224 48
legal 0 224 48
chopping 0 224 48
block 0 224 48
for 0 224 48
the 0 224 48
dissolution 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
any 0 224 48
house 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
contemplative 0 224 48
nuns 0 224 48
that 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
judged 0 224 48
to 0 224 48
be 0 224 48
hovering 0 224 48
on 0 224 48
the 0 224 48
edge 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
extinction 1 224 48
or 0 224 48
is 0 224 48
for 0 224 48
some 0 224 48
other 0 224 48
reason 0 224 48
in 0 224 48
need 0 224 48
of 0 224 48
the 0 224 48
chop. 0 224 48

Why 0 224 49
would 0 224 49
the 0 224 49
Vatican 0 224 49
need 0 224 49
a 0 224 49
document 0 224 49
giving 0 224 49
extensive 0 224 49
norms 0 224 49
for 0 224 49
the 0 224 49
closure 0 224 49
of 0 224 49
monasteries 0 224 49
that 0 224 49
have 0 224 49
too 0 224 49
few 0 224 49
nuns 0 224 49
or 0 224 49
do 0 224 49
not 0 224 49
follow 0 224 49
their 0 224 49
originally 0 224 49
intended 0 224 49
charisms 0 224 49
if 0 224 49
everything 0 224 49
about 0 224 49
the 0 224 49
religious 0 224 49
life 0 224 49
since 0 224 49
Vatican 0 224 49
II 0 224 49
has 0 224 49
been 0 224 49
hunky 0 224 49
dory? 0 224 49

Let’s 0 224 50
remember 0 224 50
that 0 224 50
this 0 224 50
comes 0 224 50
from 0 224 50
the 0 224 50
Congregation 0 224 50
for 0 224 50
Religious 0 224 50
of 0 224 50
Braz 0 224 50
de’Aviz 0 224 50
and 0 224 50
Jose 0 224 50
Rodriguez 0 224 50
Carballo. 0 224 50

This 0 224 51
is 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
Cardinal 0 224 51
Braz 0 224 51
de’Aviz[2] 0 224 51
who 0 224 51
wasted 0 224 51
no 0 224 51
time 0 224 51
in 0 224 51
orienting 0 224 51
himself 0 224 51
in 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
New 0 224 51
Paradigm 0 224 51
when, 0 224 51
close 0 224 51
on 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
heels 0 224 51
of 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
Conclave 0 224 51
he 0 224 51
slammed 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
attempt 0 224 51
by 0 224 51
his 0 224 51
predecessor 0 224 51
– 0 224 51
and 0 224 51
by 0 224 51
extension 0 224 51
Pope 0 224 51
Benedict 0 224 51
– 0 224 51
to 0 224 51
reign 0 224 51
in 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
notorious 0 224 51
Leadership 0 224 51
Conference 0 224 51
of 0 224 51
Women 0 224 51
Religious 0 224 51
in 0 224 51
the 0 224 51
US. 0 224 51

He 0 224 52
complained 0 224 52
that 0 224 52
he 0 224 52
had 0 224 52
been 0 224 52
shut 0 224 52
out 0 224 52
of 0 224 52
the 0 224 52
process 0 224 52
under 0 224 52
Cardinal 0 224 52
Rode, 0 224 52
and 0 224 52
later 0 224 52
made 0 224 52
a 0 224 52
large 0 224 52
and 0 224 52
public 0 224 52
point 0 224 52
of 0 224 52
appeasing 0 224 52
and 0 224 52
mollifying 0 224 52
the 1 224 52
most 1 224 52
outspokenly 1 224 52
heretical 1 224 52
and 1 224 52
politicised 1 224 52
organisation 1 224 52
of 1 224 52
female 1 224 52
religious 1 224 52
in 1 224 52
the 1 224 52
world. 1 224 52

Apparently 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
total 0 224 53
statistical 0 224 53
collapse 0 224 53
of 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
religious 0 224 53
life 0 224 53
following 0 224 53
Vatican 0 224 53
II[3] 0 224 53
had 0 224 53
nothing 0 224 53
to 0 224 53
do 0 224 53
with 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
massive 0 224 53
systemic 0 224 53
changes 0 224 53
to 0 224 53
the 0 224 53
forms 0 224 53
of 0 224 53
that 0 224 53
life 0 224 53
– 0 224 53
always 0 224 53
claimed 0 224 53
to 0 224 53
be 0 224 53
“mandated” 0 224 53
by 0 224 53
“the 0 224 53
Council”. 0 224 53

And 0 224 54
of 0 224 54
course 0 224 54
we 0 224 54
are 0 224 54
talking 0 224 54
about 0 224 54
the 0 224 54
priorities 0 224 54
of 0 224 54
a 0 224 54
pope 0 224 54
who 0 224 54
has 0 224 54
said 0 224 54
that 0 224 54
seeing 0 224 54
a 0 224 54
“restorationist” 0 224 54
community 0 224 54
enjoying 0 224 54
a 0 224 54
large 0 224 54
number 0 224 54
of 0 224 54
vocations 0 224 54
makes 0 224 54
him 0 224 54
“worry.” 0 224 54
Apparently 0 224 54
this 0 224 54
worry 0 224 54
was 0 224 54
serious 0 224 54
enough 0 224 54
to 0 224 54
move 0 224 54
him 0 224 54
to 0 224 54
torpedo 1 224 54
one 0 224 54
of 0 224 54
the 1 224 54
most 1 224 54
flourishing 1 224 54

Autonomy 1 224 55
vs. 0 224 55

Independence 0 224 56

One 0 224 57
of 0 224 57
the 0 224 57
talking 0 224 57
points 0 224 57
the 0 224 57
media 0 224 57
have 0 224 57
latched 0 224 57
onto 0 224 57
is 0 224 57
the 0 224 57
whole 0 224 57
business 0 224 57
of 0 224 57
“autonomy” 1 224 57
of 0 224 57
monasteries. 0 224 57

Many 0 224 58
of 0 224 58
the 0 224 58
headlines 0 224 58
crowed: 0 224 58
“Vatican 0 224 58
confirms 0 224 58
nuns’ 0 224 58
autonomy,” 1 224 58
or 0 224 58
similar. 0 224 58

But 0 224 59
that 0 224 59
word 0 224 59
does 0 224 59
not 0 224 59
mean 0 224 59
what 0 224 59
they 0 224 59
think 0 224 59
it 0 224 59
means. 0 224 59

In 0 224 60
fact, 0 224 60
the 0 224 60
word 0 224 60
“autonomy” 1 224 60
is 0 224 60
the 0 224 60
key 0 224 60
to 0 224 60
understanding 0 224 60
this 0 224 60
whole 0 224 60
thing. 0 224 60

It 0 224 61
appears 0 224 61
in 0 224 61
the 0 224 61
document 0 224 61
16 0 224 61
times 0 224 61
and 0 224 61
“autonomous” 1 224 61
30 0 224 61
times. 0 224 61

In 0 224 62
fact, 0 224 62
“autonomy” 1 224 62
is 0 224 62
held 0 224 62
up 0 224 62
as 0 224 62
the 0 224 62
single 0 224 62
most 0 224 62
important 0 224 62
criterion 0 224 62
for 0 224 62
determining 0 224 62
a 0 224 62
monastery’s 0 224 62
viability. 0 224 62

This 0 224 63
emphasis 0 224 63
is 0 224 63
repeated 0 224 63
so 0 224 63
often 0 224 63
one 0 224 63
might 0 224 63
almost 0 224 63
think 0 224 63
there 0 224 63
is 0 224 63
a 0 224 63
concern 0 224 63
in 0 224 63
Rome 0 224 63
that 0 224 63
the 0 224 63
“fruitful” 1 224 63
post-conciliar 0 224 63
monastic 0 224 63
life 0 224 63
is 0 224 63
in 0 224 63
danger 0 224 63
of 0 224 63
fizzling 0 224 63
out… 0 224 63
for… 0 224 63
some 0 224 63
reason… 0 224 63

the 0 224 72

this 0 224 72

redefining 0 224 72
the 0 224 72

“autonomous” 1 224 72
to 0 224 72
exclude 0 224 72

What 0 224 73
got 0 224 73
no 0 224 73
mention 0 224 73
in 0 224 73
the 0 224 73
brief 0 224 73

interest 0 224 73
was 0 224 73
the 0 224 73
document’s 0 224 73
insistence 0 224 73
that 0 224 73
all 0 224 73
monasteries 0 224 73
of 0 224 73
nuns 0 224 73
must 0 224 73
belong 0 224 73

a 0 224 73
federation 0 224 73

monasteries 0 224 73
must 0 224 73
demonstrate 0 224 73
“autonomy” 1 224 73
they 0 224 73
will 0 224 73
be 0 224 73
granted 0 224 73
little 0 224 73
in 0 224 73
the 0 224 73
way 0 224 73
of 0 224 73
powers 0 224 73

As 0 224 74
we 0 224 74
will 0 224 74
see, 0 224 74
the 0 224 74
federations 0 224 74
are 0 224 74
now 0 224 74
a 0 224 74
multilayered 0 224 74
system 0 224 74
of 0 224 74
internal 0 224 74
surveillance 0 224 74
and 0 224 74
centralised 0 224 74
control 0 224 74
that 0 224 74
leaves 0 224 74
Orwell 0 224 74
in 0 224 74
the 0 224 74
dust: 0 224 74

overcome 0 224 75
isolation 0 224 75
and 0 224 75
promote 0 224 75
regular 0 224 75

contemplative 0 224 75
life. 0 224 75

Federation 0 224 76
of 0 224 76
monasteries 0 224 76
means 0 224 76
a 0 224 76
structure 0 224 76
of 0 224 76
communion 0 224 76
among 0 224 76
some 0 224 76
autonomous 0 224 76
monasteries 0 224 76
of 0 224 76
the 0 224 76
same 0 224 76
Institute 0 224 76
[4] 0 224 76
, 0 224 76
erected 0 224 76
by 0 224 76
the 0 224 76
Holy 0 224 76
See 0 224 76
that 0 224 76
approves 0 224 76
the 0 224 76
Statutes, 0 224 76
so 0 224 76
that 0 224 76
in 0 224 76
sharing 0 224 76
the 0 224 76
same 0 224 76

promote 0 224 76
regular 0 224 76
observance 0 224 76
and 0 224 76
contemplative 0 224 76
life. 0 224 76

Note 0 224 77
the 0 224 77
change: 0 224 77
“independent” 0 224 77
is 0 224 77
replaced 0 224 77
with 0 224 77
“isolated[5].” 0 224 77
It 0 224 77
reminds 0 224 77
me 0 224 77
of 0 224 77
a 0 224 77
conversation 0 224 77
I 0 224 77
had 0 224 77
with 0 224 77
a 0 224 77
superior 0 224 77
of 0 224 77
a 0 224 77
Benedictine 0 224 77
house 0 224 77
in 0 224 77
the 0 224 77
UK. 0 224 77

She 0 224 78
said 0 224 78
she 0 224 78
thought 0 224 78
that 0 224 78
the 0 224 78
psychiatric 0 224 78
testing, 0 224 78
that 0 224 78
in 0 224 78
2008 0 224 78
was 0 224 78
still 0 224 78
all 0 224 78
the 0 224 78
rage 0 224 78
among 0 224 78
the 0 224 78
houses 0 224 78
of 0 224 78
her 0 224 78
monastery’s 0 224 78
federation, 0 224 78
was 0 224 78
excessive 0 224 78
and 0 224 78
not 0 224 78
helpful. 0 224 78

She 0 224 79
didn’t 0 224 79
trust 0 224 79
the 0 224 79
heavily 0 224 79
secularised 0 224 79
field 0 224 79
of 0 224 79
psychology 0 224 79
to 0 224 79
help 0 224 79
in 0 224 79
determining 0 224 79
a 0 224 79
candidate’s 0 224 79
suitability 0 224 79
for 0 224 79
religious 0 224 79
life, 0 224 79
so 0 224 79
she 0 224 79
didn’t 0 224 79
require 0 224 79
these 0 224 79
tests 0 224 79
of 0 224 79
her 0 224 79
monastery’s 0 224 79
postulants. 0 224 79

She 0 224 80
also 0 224 80
said 0 224 80
that 0 224 80
she 0 224 80
was 0 224 80
under 0 224 80
constant 0 224 80
pressure, 0 224 80
both 0 224 80
the 0 224 80
subtle 0 224 80
pressure 0 224 80
of 0 224 80
general 0 224 80
peer 0 224 80
disapproval 0 224 80
and 0 224 80
overt 0 224 80
requests 0 224 80
to 0 224 80
conform 0 224 80
by 0 224 80
the 0 224 80
federation’s 0 224 80
leadership. 0 224 80

Was 0 224 81
that 0 224 81
monastery 0 224 81
“isolated”? 0 224 81

Or 0 224 82
just 0 224 82
exercising 0 224 82
lawful 0 224 82
self-governance? 0 224 82

And 0 224 83
given 0 224 83
that 0 224 83
autonomy 1 224 83
is 0 224 83
being 0 224 83
held 0 224 83
up 0 224 83
as 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
sole 0 224 83
criterion 0 224 83
for 0 224 83
viability 0 224 83
of 0 224 83
a 0 224 83
monastery, 0 224 83
it 0 224 83
seems 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
Holy 0 224 83
See 0 224 83
is 0 224 83
not 0 224 83
interested 0 224 83
in 0 224 83
asking 0 224 83
whether 0 224 83
it 0 224 83
is 0 224 83
actually 0 224 83
faithful 0 224 83
to 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
charism, 0 224 83
or 0 224 83
even 0 224 83
to 0 224 83
the 0 224 83
Catholic 0 224 83
Faith, 0 224 83
a 0 224 83
question 0 224 83
that 0 224 83
has 0 224 83
burned 0 224 83
brightly 0 224 83
for 0 224 83
serious 0 224 83
Catholics 0 224 83
for 0 224 83
some 0 224 83
time. 0 224 83

The 0 224 84
word 0 224 84
“fidelity” 0 224 84
appears 0 224 84
in 0 224 84
the 0 224 84
document 0 224 84
four 0 224 84
times, 0 224 84
which 0 224 84
may 0 224 84
give 0 224 84
an 0 224 84
idea 0 224 84
of 0 224 84
how 0 224 84
much 0 224 84
interest 0 224 84
the 0 224 84
Vatican 0 224 84
has 0 224 84
in 0 224 84
this 0 224 84
issue. 0 224 84

Funny 0 224 85
you 0 224 85
should 0 224 85
mention 0 224 85
autonomy: 1 224 85
Bioethics 0 224 85
and 0 224 85
the 0 224 85
dissolution 0 224 85
of 0 224 85
“unviable” 0 224 85
monasteries 0 224 85

It’s 0 224 86
funny 0 224 86
that 0 224 86
the 0 224 86
buzzword 0 224 86
of 0 224 86
the 0 224 86
day 0 224 86
in 0 224 86
Rome 0 224 86
should 0 224 86
be 0 224 86
“autonomy”. 1 224 86

As 0 224 87
we 0 224 87
shall 0 224 87
see, 0 224 87
the 0 224 87
document 0 224 87
is 0 224 87
what 0 224 87
I’ve 0 224 87
called 0 224 87
above 0 224 87
a 0 224 87
“chopping 0 224 87
block”. 0 224 87

Vultum 0 224 88
dei 0 224 88
quaerere 0 224 88
made 0 224 88
it 0 224 88
clear 0 224 88
that 0 224 88
this 0 224 88
juridical 0 224 88
document 0 224 88
would 0 224 88
provide 0 224 88
a 0 224 88
set 0 224 88
of 0 224 88
legal 0 224 88
criteria 0 224 88
by 0 224 88
which 0 224 88
a 0 224 88
monastery 0 224 88
can 0 224 88
be 0 224 88
considered 0 224 88
viable, 0 224 88
religious 0 224 88
life 0 224 88
worthy 0 224 88
of 0 224 88
life, 0 224 88
so 0 224 88
to 0 224 88
speak, 0 224 88
and 0 224 88
that 0 224 88
those 0 224 88
considered 0 224 88
to 0 224 88
have 0 224 88
failed 0 224 88
the 0 224 88
test 0 224 88
would 0 224 88
be 0 224 88
closed. 0 224 88

Note 0 224 89
the 0 224 89
language 0 224 89
used 0 224 89
here: 0 224 89

If 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
situation 0 224 90
of 0 224 90
incapacity 0 224 90
is 0 224 90
irreversible, 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
solution, 0 224 90
as 0 224 90
painful 0 224 90
as 0 224 90
it 0 224 90
is 0 224 90
necessary, 0 224 90
is 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
suppression 0 224 90
of 0 224 90
the 0 224 90
monastery. 0 224 90

It 0 224 91
jogged 0 224 91
a 0 224 91
memory 0 224 91
for 0 224 91
me. 0 224 91

“Incapacity”… 0 224 92
Where 0 224 92
had 0 224 92
I 0 224 92
heard 0 224 92
that 0 224 92
language 0 224 92
used 0 224 92
before? 0 224 92

Most 0 224 93
pro-life 0 224 93
observers 0 224 93
in 0 224 93
Britain 0 224 93
will 0 224 93
tell 0 224 93
you 0 224 93
that 0 224 93
it 0 224 93
was 0 224 93
the 0 224 93
“Mental 0 224 93
Capacity 0 224 93
Act” 0 224 93
of 0 224 93
2005 0 224 93
that 0 224 93
established 0 224 93
in 0 224 93
British 0 224 93
law 0 224 93
the 0 224 93
concept 0 224 93
that 0 224 93
a 0 224 93
person 0 224 93
with 0 224 93
permanently 0 224 93
“reduced 0 224 93
capacity” 0 224 93
could 0 224 93
be 0 224 93
legally 0 224 93
starved 0 224 93
and/or 0 224 93
dehydrated 0 224 93
to 0 224 93
death 0 224 93
by 0 224 93
doctors. 0 224 93

This 0 224 94
is 0 224 94
the 0 224 94
world, 0 224 94
the 0 224 94
language, 0 224 94
of 0 224 94
Bioethics, 0 224 94
applied 0 224 94
utilitarianism, 0 224 94
also 0 224 94
called 0 224 94
“Principlism” 0 224 94
after 0 224 94
its 0 224 94
three 0 224 94
bioethical 0 224 94
criteria 0 224 94
of 0 224 94
“justice, 0 224 94
beneficence[6] 0 224 94
and 0 224 94
autonomy” 1 224 94
– 0 224 94
it 0 224 94
is 0 224 94
a 0 224 94
patient’s 0 224 94
ability 0 224 94
to 0 224 94
demonstrate 0 224 94
his 0 224 94
“autonomy” 1 224 94
or 0 224 94
“quality 0 224 94

either 0 224 94
currently 0 224 94
or 0 224 94
potentially, 0 224 94
that 0 224 94
decides 0 224 94
his 0 224 94
fate. 0 224 94

This 0 224 95
set 0 224 95
of 0 224 95
criteria 0 224 95
is 0 224 95
being 0 224 95
applied 0 224 95
in 0 224 95
medical 0 224 95
institutions 0 224 95
across 0 224 95
the 0 224 95
western 0 224 95
world 0 224 95
now, 0 224 95
a 0 224 95
“new 0 224 95
paradigm” 0 224 95
of 0 224 95
ethics 0 224 95
replacing 0 224 95
traditional 0 224 95

“Natural 0 224 95

Under 0 224 96
this 0 224 96
system 0 224 96
the 0 224 96
onus, 0 224 96
effectively, 0 224 96
is 0 224 96
on 0 224 96
the 0 224 96
patient 0 224 96
to 0 224 96
prove 0 224 96
according 0 224 96
to 0 224 96
the 0 224 96
new 0 224 96
criteria 0 224 96
that 0 224 96

– 0 224 96
of 0 224 96
continuing 0 224 96

Medical 0 224 97

These 0 224 99

collated 0 224 99
by 0 224 99
professional 0 224 99

If 0 224 100
the 0 224 100

doesn’t 0 224 100

out 0 224 100

The 0 224 101
NHS 0 224 101
in 0 224 101
the 0 224 101
UK 0 224 101
has 0 224 101
actually 0 224 101
gone 0 224 101
to 0 224 101
court, 0 224 101
and 0 224 101
won, 0 224 101
declaring 0 224 101
that 0 224 101
they 0 224 101
must 0 224 101
retain 0 224 101
the 0 224 101
right 0 224 101
to 0 224 101

fail 0 224 101
the 0 224 101
Bioethics 0 224 101
test. 0 224 101

The 0 224 102
result 0 224 102
has 0 224 102
been 0 224 102
a 0 224 102
quiet 0 224 102
reign 1 224 102
of 1 224 102
terror 1 224 102
in 0 224 102
which 0 224 102
elderly 0 224 102
and 0 224 102
disabled 0 224 102
people 0 224 102
have 0 224 102
started 0 224 102
carrying 0 224 102
cards 0 224 102
stating 0 224 102
in 0 224 102
legalese 0 224 102
that 0 224 102
they 0 224 102
do 0 224 102
not 0 224 102
want 0 224 102
to 0 224 102
be 0 224 102
killed 0 224 102
by 0 224 102
their 0 224 102
doctors. 0 224 102

In 0 224 103
one 0 224 103
case 0 224 103
a 0 224 103
man 0 224 103
with 0 224 103
ALS 0 224 103
took 0 224 103
the 0 224 103
NHS 0 224 103
to 0 224 103
court 0 224 103
in 0 224 103
an 0 224 103
ultimately 0 224 103
unsuccessful 0 224 103
attempt 0 224 103
to 0 224 103
preemptively 0 224 103
preclude 0 224 103
his 0 224 103
medical 0 224 103
murder 0 224 103
when 0 224 103
his 0 224 103
illness 0 224 103
left 0 224 103
him 0 224 103
incapacitated. 0 224 103

The 0 224 104
system, 0 224 104
in 0 224 104
other 0 224 104
words, 0 224 104
is 0 224 104
stacked 0 224 104
against 0 224 104
the 0 224 104
patient, 0 224 104
in 0 224 104
favour 0 224 104
of 0 224 104
the 0 224 104
government 0 224 104
that 0 224 104
holds 0 224 104
all 0 224 104
the 0 224 104
cards. 0 224 104

Keep 0 224 105
these 0 224 105
facts 0 224 105
in 0 224 105
mind 0 224 105
as 0 224 105
we 0 224 105
read 0 224 105
through 0 224 105
the 0 224 105
rest 0 224 105
of 0 224 105
the 0 224 105
document. 0 224 105

I 0 224 106
think 0 224 106
we 0 224 106
can 0 224 106
find 0 224 106
an 0 224 106
almost 0 224 106
perfect 0 224 106
analogy 0 224 106
by 0 224 106
replacing 0 224 106
the 0 224 106
term 0 224 106
“patient” 0 224 106
with 0 224 106
“monastery.” 0 224 106
Think 0 224 106
about 0 224 106
how 0 224 106
one 0 224 106
would 0 224 106
apply 0 224 106
concepts 0 224 106
like 0 224 106
“autonomy,” 1 224 106
“viability,” 0 224 106
“incapacity,” 0 224 106
“quality 0 224 106
of 0 224 106
life” 0 224 106
and 0 224 106
“equitable 0 224 106
distribution 0 224 106
of 0 224 106
scarce 0 224 106
resources” 0 224 106
to 0 224 106
this 0 224 106
context. 0 224 106

When 0 224 107
the 0 224 107
language 0 224 107
of 0 224 107
utilitarianism 0 224 107
appears 0 224 107
in 0 224 107
Vatican 0 224 107
documents 0 224 107
as 0 224 107
guiding 0 224 107

for 0 224 107
the 0 224 107
contemplative 0 224 107
religious 0 224 107
life, 0 224 107
one 0 224 107
has 0 224 107
to 0 224 107
wonder 0 224 107
at 0 224 107
what 0 224 107
point 0 224 107
has 0 224 107
the 0 224 107
entire 0 224 107
project 0 224 107
gone 0 224 107
so 0 224 107
disastrously 1 224 107
off 0 224 107
the 0 224 107
rails. 0 224 107

Federations 0 224 108
as 0 224 108
Vatican 0 224 108

Under 0 224 109
this 0 224 109
law, 0 224 109
all 0 224 109
monasteries 0 224 109
of 0 224 109
contemplative 0 224 109

to 0 224 109
a 0 224 109

Previously 0 224 110
only 0 224 110
voluntary 0 224 110
and 0 224 110
consultative, 0 224 110
federations 0 224 110
will 0 224 110
now 0 224 110
have 0 224 110
the 0 224 110
power 0 224 110
to 0 224 110
supervise 0 224 110
and 0 224 110
guide 0 224 110
the 0 224 110
formation 0 224 110
of 0 224 110
candidates, 0 224 110
nuns 0 224 110
and 0 224 110
of 0 224 110
their 0 224 110
formators, 0 224 110
as 0 224 110
well 0 224 110
as 0 224 110
possess 0 224 110
broad 0 224 110
powers 0 224 110
over 0 224 110

of 0 224 110

The 0 224 111
document 0 224 111
makes 0 224 111
it 0 224 111
inarguable 0 224 111
that 0 224 111
the 0 224 111

this 0 224 129

daily 0 224 153
life. 0 224 153

One 0 224 154
of 0 224 154
these 0 224 154
things 0 224 154
is 0 224 154
not 0 224 154
like 0 224 154
the 0 224 154
others. 0 224 154

Did 0 224 155
you 0 224 155
notice? 0 224 155

One 0 224 156
criterion 0 224 156
stands 0 224 156
out 0 224 156
as 0 224 156
indeterminate, 0 224 156
vague, 0 224 156
compared 0 224 156
with 0 224 156
the 0 224 156
other 0 224 156
concrete 0 224 156
and 0 224 156
measurable 0 224 156
standards. 0 224 156

One 0 224 157
aspect 0 224 157
of 0 224 157
legislative 0 224 157
analysis 0 224 157
that 0 224 157
I 0 224 157
learned 0 224 157
early 0 224 157
was 0 224 157
that 0 224 157
the 0 224 157
terms 0 224 157
used 0 224 157
are 0 224 157
of 0 224 157
utmost 0 224 157
importance. 0 224 157

If 0 224 158
a 0 224 158
term 0 224 158
is 0 224 158
vague 0 224 158
or 0 224 158
is 0 224 158
defined 0 224 158
incorrectly 0 224 158
that 0 224 158
is 0 224 158
a 0 224 158
“loophole”. 0 224 158

Or 0 224 159
it 0 224 159
could 0 224 159
perhaps 0 224 159
be 0 224 159
described 0 224 159
as 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
handle; 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
place 0 224 159
where 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
person 0 224 159
who 0 224 159
wants 0 224 159
to 0 224 159
effect 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
particular 0 224 159
outcome 0 224 159
can 0 224 159
grasp 0 224 159
a 0 224 159
piece 0 224 159
of 0 224 159
legislation 0 224 159
to 0 224 159
use 0 224 159
it 0 224 159
like 0 224 159
an 0 224 159
axe. 0 224 159

So, 0 224 160
how, 0 224 160
exactly, 0 224 160
is 0 224 160
it 0 224 160
to 0 224 160
be 0 224 160
determined 0 224 160
– 0 224 160
and 0 224 160
by 0 224 160
whom 0 224 160
– 0 224 160
that 0 224 160
a 0 224 160
group 0 224 160
of 0 224 160
nuns 0 224 160
possess 0 224 160
“the 0 224 160
necessary 0 224 160
vitality 0 224 160
in 0 224 160
living 0 224 160
and 0 224 160
transmitting 0 224 160
the 0 224 160
charism”? 0 224 160

What, 0 224 161
precisely, 0 224 161
does 0 224 161
the 0 224 161
term 0 224 161
“vitality” 0 224 161
mean 0 224 161
and 0 224 161
exactly 0 224 161
how 0 224 161
is 0 224 161
one 0 224 161
to 0 224 161
measure 0 224 161
out 0 224 161
how 0 224 161
much 0 224 161
is 0 224 161
required? 0 224 161

Is 0 224 162
this 0 224 162
one 0 224 162
of 0 224 162
Pope 0 224 162
Francis 0 224 162
little 0 224 162
personal, 0 224 162
secret 0 224 162
expressions 0 224 162
of 0 224 162
which 0 224 162
only 0 224 162
he 0 224 162
knows 0 224 162
the 0 224 162
meaning? 0 224 162

Like 0 224 163
the 0 224 163
secret 0 224 163
to 0 224 163
how 0 224 163
nuns 0 224 163
are 0 224 163
to 0 224 163
smile 0 224 163
properly? 0 224 163

Does 0 224 164
the 0 224 164
inclusion 0 224 164
of 0 224 164
completely 0 224 164
subjective 0 224 164
criteria 0 224 164
belong 0 224 164
in 0 224 164
a 0 224 164
juridical 0 224 164
document? 0 224 164

Or 0 224 165
is 0 224 165
it 0 224 165
in 0 224 165
there 0 224 165
in 0 224 165
order 0 224 165
to 0 224 165
provide 0 224 165
cover 0 224 165
for 0 224 165
prelates? 0 224 165

The 0 224 166
next 0 224 166
article 0 224 166
tells 0 224 166
us, 0 224 166
“It 0 224 166
is 0 224 166
the 0 224 166

Do 0 224 166
they 0 224 166
have 0 224 166
an 0 224 166
electronic 0 224 166

“charism 0 224 166

It 0 224 167
seems 0 224 167
important 0 224 167
to 0 224 167
ask 0 224 167
because 0 224 167
article 0 224 167
70, 0 224 167
on 0 224 167
how 0 224 167

it: 0 224 167

Among 0 224 168
the 0 224 168

that 0 224 168
can 0 224 168

concerning 0 224 168
the 0 224 168
suppression 0 224 168
of 0 224 168
a 0 224 168

the 0 224 168

should 0 224 168
be 0 224 168
considered 0 224 168
as 0 224 168
a 0 224 168
whole: 0 224 168
the 0 224 168
number 0 224 168
of 0 224 168
nuns, 0 224 168

the 0 224 168
real 0 224 168
capacity 0 224 168
for 0 224 168
government 0 224 168
and 0 224 168
formation, 0 224 168
lack 0 224 168
of 0 224 168
candidates 0 224 168
for 0 224 168
a 0 224 168
number 0 224 168

dynamic 0 224 168
fidelity[10]. 0 224 168

You 0 224 169
will 0 224 169
be 0 224 169
affiliated; 0 224 169
resistance 0 224 169
is 0 224 169
futile… 0 224 169

It 0 224 170
seems 0 224 170
there 0 224 170
are 0 224 170
two 0 224 170
themes 0 224 170
running 0 224 170
through 0 224 170
the 0 224 170
document: 0 224 170
to 0 224 170
establish 0 224 170
a 0 224 170
certain 0 224 170
value 0 224 170
of 0 224 170
“autonomy” 1 224 170
as 0 224 170
the 0 224 170
indispensable 0 224 170
criterion 0 224 170
for 0 224 170
viability, 0 224 170
while 0 224 170
at 0 224 170
the 0 224 170
same 0 224 170
time 0 224 170
asserting 0 224 170
top-down 0 224 170
oversight 0 224 170

control 0 224 170

who 0 224 170
gets 0 224 170
to 0 224 170
make 0 224 170
this 0 224 170
determination. 0 224 170

In 0 224 171
short, 0 224 171
a 0 224 171
monastery 0 224 171
must 0 224 171
be 0 224 171
autonomous, 1 224 171
but 0 224 171
heaven 0 224 171
help 0 224 171
the 0 224 171
community 0 224 171
that 0 224 171
asserts 0 224 171
its 0 224 171
independence. 0 224 171

Articles 0 224 172
54-64 0 224 172
offer 0 224 172
an 0 224 172
interim 0 224 172

in 0 224 172
the 0 224 172
case 0 224 172
of 0 224 172
“incapacity” 0 224 172
that 0 224 172

really 0 224 172
just 0 224 172
more 0 224 172
of 0 224 172
the 0 224 172

Mariawald 0 224 183

consequently 0 224 183
affiliated, 0 224 183

the 0 224 183
manner 0 224 183
this 0 224 183

the 0 224 183
Netherlands 0 224 183
whose 0 224 183
superior, 0 224 183
unsurprisingly, 0 224 183
discovered 0 224 183
that 0 224 183
the 0 224 183
house 0 224 183
was 0 224 183
hopelessly 0 224 183

It 0 224 191
would 0 224 191
seem, 0 224 191
therefore, 0 224 191
that 0 224 191

a 0 224 191
careful 0 224 191
comparison. 0 224 191

that 0 224 192
here, 0 224 192
but 0 224 192
it 0 224 192
might 0 224 192
be 0 224 192
helpful 0 224 192
to 0 224 192
examine 0 224 192
the 0 224 192
two 0 224 192

Worth 0 224 193
remembering, 0 224 193
however, 0 224 193
is 0 224 193
the 0 224 193

presumably 0 224 193
under 0 224 193

were 0 224 193
started. 0 224 193

[3] 0 224 194
Just 0 224 194
considering 0 224 194
the 0 224 194
numbers 0 224 194
of 0 224 194
course. 0 224 194

Leaving 0 224 195
alone 0 224 195
the 0 224 195

from 0 224 197

nerve 0 224 197
to 0 224 197
tell 0 224 197

a 0 224 197
desirable 0 224 197

a 0 224 200
capital 0 224 200

[8] 0 224 201
Readers 0 224 201
may 0 224 201

I’m 0 224 201
exaggerating 0 224 201

for 0 224 201
suppressing 0 224 201

but 0 224 201
as 0 224 201
we 0 224 201
will 0 224 201
see, 0 224 201
the 0 224 201

a 0 224 201
matter 0 224 201
of 0 224 201
paperwork 0 224 201
and 0 224 201
it 0 224 201
is 0 224 201
well 0 224 201
to 0 224 201
recall 0 224 201

a 0 224 201
person 0 224 201
of 0 224 201
interest 0 224 201
to 0 224 201
international 0 224 201
police 0 224 201
agencies 0 224 201
for 0 224 201
the 0 224 201
loss 0 224 201
of 0 224 201
“tens 0 224 201
of 0 224 201
millions” 0 224 201
of 0 224 201

from 0 224 201
the 0 224 201

of 0 224 201
the 0 224 201
Franciscan 0 224 201

been 0 224 201
the 0 224 201
head. 0 224 201

Shortly 0 224 202
after 0 224 202
Carballo’s 0 224 202
appointment, 0 224 202
it 0 224 202
was 0 224 202
revealed 0 224 202
that 0 224 202
the 0 224 202
Swiss 0 224 202

from 0 224 202

it 0 224 203
was 0 224 203
to 0 224 203
him 0 224 203
that 0 224 203
the 0 224 203
pope 0 224 203
gave 0 224 203
the 0 224 203

he 0 235 15
laid 0 235 15
out 0 235 15
pretty 0 235 15
clearly 0 235 15
what 0 235 15
was 0 235 15
coming 0 235 15
in 0 235 15
this 0 235 15
piece 0 235 15
of 0 235 15

In 0 235 16
fact, 0 235 16
as 0 235 16
the 0 235 16
National 0 235 16
Catholic 0 235 16
Reporter 0 235 16
piece 0 235 16
said, 0 235 16
the 0 235 16
meeting 0 235 16
itself 0 235 16
was 0 235 16
“unprecedented,” 0 235 16

formators 0 235 16
of 0 235 16
religious 0 235 16
life 0 235 16

by 0 235 16
the 0 235 16
Congregation 0 235 16
for 0 235 16
Religious 0 235 16
in 0 235 16
order 0 235 16
to 0 235 16
hear 0 235 16
the 0 235 16
new 0 235 16
marching 0 235 16
orders. 0 235 16

This 0 235 17
is 0 235 17
the 0 235 17
programme: 0 235 17

“Do 0 235 18
not 0 235 18
distance 0 235 18
yourself 0 235 18
from 0 235 18
the 0 235 18
great 0 235 18
lines 0 235 18
of 0 235 18
the 0 235 18
Second 0 235 18
Vatican 0 235 18
Council.” 0 235 18
“In 0 235 18
fact, 0 235 18
those 1 235 18
that 1 235 18
are 1 235 18
distancing 1 235 18
themselves 1 235 18
from 1 235 18
the 1 235 18
council 1 235 18
to 1 235 18
make 1 235 18
another 1 235 18
path 1 235 18
are 1 235 18
killing 1 235 18
themselves 1 235 18
– 0 235 18
sooner 1 235 18
or 1 235 18
later, 1 235 18
they 1 235 18
will 1 235 18
die. 1 235 18

They 0 235 19
will 0 235 19
not 0 235 19
have 0 235 19
sense. 0 235 19

They 1 235 20
will 1 235 20
be 1 235 20
outside 1 235 20
the 1 235 20
church. 1 235 20

We 0 235 21
need 0 235 21
to 0 235 21
build, 0 235 21
using 0 235 21
the 0 235 21
Gospel 0 235 21
and 0 235 21
the 0 235 21
Council 0 235 21
as 0 235 21
a 0 235 21
departure 0 235 21

After 0 235 22
breathing 0 235 22
this 0 235 22
threat, 0 235 22
the 0 235 22
cardinal 0 235 22
continued, 0 235 22
saying 0 235 22
that 0 235 22
because 0 235 22
modern 0 235 22
people’s 0 235 22
“needs” 0 235 22
are 0 235 22
fundamentally 0 235 22
different 0 235 22
from 0 235 22
what 0 235 22
they 0 235 22
were 0 235 22
in 0 235 22
the 0 235 22
past, 0 235 22
there 0 235 22
was 0 235 22
no 0 235 22
reason 0 235 22
to 0 235 22

too 0 235 22
closely 0 235 22
to 0 235 22

“These 0 235 25

changed. 0 235 25

the 0 235 26
council 0 235 26
reminds 0 235 26
us 0 235 26
that 0 235 26

we 0 235 31
point 0 235 31

profound 0 235 31
conviction 0 235 31
that 0 235 31
the 0 235 31

non-negotiable, 0 235 31

It 0 235 36
is 0 235 36
to 0 235 36
wonder 0 235 36
what 0 235 36
this 0 235 36

make 0 235 36
of 0 235 36

as 0 235 37

we 0 235 37
cannot 0 235 37
remain 0 235 37

“After 0 235 38
entering 0 235 38
into 0 235 38
Christ 0 235 38
by 0 235 38

by 0 235 38
the 0 235 38
monastic 0 235 38

we 0 235 38

Sister 0 235 43

continued, 0 235 43
saying 0 235 43
that 0 235 43
the 0 235 43
document 0 235 43
explicitly 0 235 43
derogates 0 235 43
the 0 235 43
founding 0 235 43
intentions 0 235 43
of 0 235 43
St. 0 235 43
Teresa 0 235 43
for 0 235 43
whom 0 235 43
real 0 235 43
autonomy 0 235 43
was 0 235 43
a 0 235 43
crucial 0 235 43
element 0 235 43
of 0 235 43
her 0 235 43
Carmelite 0 235 43
reform. 0 235 43

She 0 235 44
acknowledges 0 235 44
that 0 235 44
cloistered 0 235 44
orders 0 235 44
of 0 235 44
nuns 0 235 44
have 0 235 44
for 0 235 44
some 0 235 44
time 0 235 44
been 0 235 44
gathered 0 235 44
into 0 235 44
federations. 0 235 44

These 0 235 45
are 0 235 45
already 0 235 45
doing 0 235 45
the 0 235 45
Cor 0 235 45
orans 0 235 45
programme, 0 235 45
having 0 235 45
shared 0 235 45
initial 0 235 45
formation 0 235 45
programmes 0 235 45
for 0 235 45
postulants 0 235 45
and 0 235 45
novices, 0 235 45
“ongoing 0 235 45
formation” 0 235 45
courses 0 235 45
for 0 235 45
professed 0 235 45
nuns, 0 235 45
a 0 235 45
federal 0 235 45
abbess 0 235 45
or 0 235 45
president 0 235 45
who 0 235 45
oversees 0 235 45
all 0 235 45
the 0 235 45
federated 0 235 45
monasteries. 0 235 45

Their 0 235 46
funds 0 235 46
are 0 235 46
already 0 235 46
interconnected 0 235 46
and 0 235 46
they 0 235 46
have 0 235 46
regular 0 235 46
meetings 0 235 46
with 0 235 46
and 0 235 46
input 0 235 46
from 0 235 46
the 0 235 46
male 0 235 46
branches. 0 235 46

In 0 235 47
2015, 0 235 47
Carmelite 0 235 47
monasteries 0 235 47
received 0 235 47
a 0 235 47
questionnaire 0 235 47
from 0 235 47
the 0 235 47
Father 0 235 47
General 0 235 47
Fr. 0 235 47

Saverio 0 235 48
Cannistra, 0 235 48
a 0 235 48
Mexican 0 235 48
and 0 235 48
devotee 0 235 48
of 0 235 48
Liberation 0 235 48
Theology, 0 235 48
to 0 235 48
ask 0 235 48
if 0 235 48
they 0 235 48
wanted 0 235 48
an 0 235 48
International 0 235 48
Commission 0 235 48
of 0 235 48
Nuns 0 235 48
to 0 235 48
oversee 0 235 48
the 0 235 48
female 0 235 48
houses 0 235 48
place 0 235 48
of 0 235 48
the 0 235 48
Carmelite 0 235 48
Fathers. 0 235 48

This 0 235 49
suggestion 0 235 49
was 0 235 49
rejected, 0 235 49
to 0 235 49
the 0 235 49
annoyance 0 235 49
of 0 235 49
Maccise. 0 235 49

Maccise 0 235 50
also 0 235 50
promoted 0 235 50
the 0 235 50
idea 0 235 50
of 0 235 50
having 0 235 50
no 0 235 50
superiors 0 235 50
in 0 235 50
the 0 235 50
individual 0 235 50
monasteries, 0 235 50
but 0 235 50
only 0 235 50
federation 0 235 50
presidents 0 235 50
and 0 235 50
shared 0 235 50
formation 0 235 50
of 0 235 50
novices. 0 235 50

The 0 235 51
push 0 235 51
for 0 235 51
these 0 235 51
changes 0 235 51
is 0 235 51
still 0 235 51
on, 0 235 51
however, 0 235 51
under 0 235 51
the 0 235 51
current 0 235 51
General, 0 235 51
an 0 235 51
Italian, 0 235 51
Saverio 0 235 51
Cannistrà. 0 235 51

Given 0 235 52
the 0 235 52
Marxist 0 235 52
leanings 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
the 0 235 52
recent 0 235 52
crop 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
Fathers 0 235 52
General, 0 235 52
it 0 235 52
seems 0 235 52
clear 0 235 52
that 0 235 52
what 0 235 52
can 0 235 52
be 0 235 52
expected 0 235 52
by 0 235 52
“ongoing 0 235 52
formation” 0 235 52
is, 0 235 52
in 0 235 52
essence, 0 235 52
some 0 235 52
form 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
political 0 235 52
indoctrination, 0 235 52
sprayed 0 235 52
over 0 235 52
with 0 235 52
a 0 235 52
micro-thin 0 235 52
layer 0 235 52
of 0 235 52
pious 0 235 52
language. 0 235 52

But 0 235 53
for 0 235 53
Carmelite 0 235 53
nuns, 0 235 53
Sister 0 235 53
said, 0 235 53
these 0 235 53
ideas 0 235 53
are 0 235 53
the 0 235 53
antithesis 0 235 53
of 0 235 53
the 0 235 53
intentions 0 235 53
of 0 235 53
St. 0 235 53
Teresa. 0 235 53

Authentic 0 235 54
autonomy, 0 235 54
independence 0 235 54
of 0 235 54
formation 0 235 54
and 0 235 54
finances, 0 235 54
“are 0 235 54

that 0 235 54
Our 0 235 54

“They 0 235 55
go 0 235 55
against 0 235 55

though 0 235 55
Cor 0 235 55

that 0 235 55

that 0 235 59

it’s 0 235 60
going 0 235 60

now 0 235 61
nine 0 235 61

as 0 235 61
absurd, 1 235 61
saying 0 235 61
it 0 235 61
will 0 235 61
tend 0 235 61

“As 0 235 62

Our 0 235 63

a 0 235 63

It 0 235 64
will 0 235 64
also 0 235 64

In 0 235 73
this 0 235 73
day 0 235 73
and 0 235 73
age, 0 235 73
when 0 235 73
Pope 0 235 73
Francis 0 235 73

proclaiming, 0 235 73
if 0 235 73

and 0 235 73
‘choice’ 0 235 73
for 0 235 73
all, 0 235 73
plus 0 235 73
the 0 235 73

here 0 235 73
our 0 235 73

completely 0 235 73
taken 0 235 73
away.” 0 235 73

Another 0 235 74
nun 0 235 74
has 0 235 74
written 0 235 74
saying 0 235 74
that 0 235 74
they 0 235 74
cannot 0 235 74
conceive 0 235 74
of 0 235 74
what 0 235 74
these 0 235 74
people 0 235 74
mean 0 235 74
by 0 235 74
“ongoing 0 235 74

Judging 0 235 75
from 0 235 75

from 0 235 75
already-federated 0 235 75

Europe, 0 235 75
it 0 235 75
means 0 235 75
in 0 235 75
practical 0 235 75
terms 0 235 75
going 0 235 75
in 0 235 75

The 0 235 76

“Cloistered 0 235 77

In 0 235 84

20 0 235 86
years, 0 235 86
“conservative” 0 235 86

of 0 235 86
the 0 235 86

They 0 235 87
point 0 235 87
to 0 235 87
the 0 235 87

But 0 235 88
it 0 235 88
is 0 235 88
these 0 235 88
signs 0 235 88
of 0 235 88
refusal 0 235 88
of 0 235 88

so 0 235 89
rejoiced 0 235 89
to 0 235 89
see 0 235 89
are 0 235 89
to 0 235 89
be 0 235 89
stamped 0 235 89

In 0 235 90
the 0 235 90
continuing 0 235 90

that 0 235 90
will 0 235 90
follow 0 235 90
this 0 235 90
article, 0 235 90
we 0 235 90
can 0 235 90
see 0 235 90
that 0 235 90
the 0 235 90
purpose 0 235 90
of 0 235 90
this 0 235 90
document 0 235 90
is 0 235 90
to 0 235 90
fulfill 0 235 90
the 0 235 90
totalitarian 0 235 90
fantasies 0 235 90
of 0 235 90
the 0 235 90
anti-Catholic 0 235 90
revolutionaries, 0 235 90
now 0 235 90
nearing 0 235 90
the 0 235 90
end 0 235 90
of 0 235 90
their 0 235 90
lives 0 235 90
50 0 235 90
years 0 235 90
after 0 235 90
their 0 235 90
initial 0 235 90
near-triumph. 0 235 90

Its 0 235 91
intention 0 235 91
is 0 235 91
mopping 0 235 91
up; 0 235 91
either 0 235 91
to 0 235 91
herd 0 235 91
the 0 235 91
remaining 0 235 91
recalcitrants 0 235 91
– 0 235 91
those 0 235 91
who 0 235 91
have 0 235 91
resisted 0 235 91
even 0 235 91
to 0 235 91
the 0 235 91
softened 0 235 91
and 0 235 91
conciliating 0 235 91
degrees 0 235 91
typical 0 235 91
of 0 235 91
“conservatives” 0 235 91
– 0 235 91
into 0 235 91
the 0 235 91
full 0 235 91
post-conciliar 0 235 91
“reform” 0 235 91
instituted 0 235 91
by 0 235 91
the 0 235 91
revolutionaries 0 235 91
in 0 235 91
the 0 235 91
1960s 0 235 91
– 0 235 91
or 0 235 91
to 0 235 91
close 0 235 91
them. 0 235 91

The 0 235 92
thing 0 235 92
is, 0 235 92
the 0 235 92
result 0 235 92
will 0 235 92
obviously 0 235 92
be 0 235 92
the 0 235 92
same 0 235 92
either 0 235 92
way. 0 235 92

The 0 235 93
whole 0 235 93

has 0 235 93

what 0 235 93

the 0 259 14
country 0 259 14
at 0 259 14
all. 0 259 14

Several 0 259 15
years 0 259 15
ago 0 259 15
he 0 259 15
was 0 259 15
banned 0 259 15
from 0 259 15
entering 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
country, 0 259 15
but 0 259 15
although 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
ban 0 259 15
was 0 259 15
reversed 0 259 15
on 0 259 15
appeal, 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
British 0 259 15
government 0 259 15
recently 0 259 15
banned 0 259 15
Martin 0 259 15
Sellner, 0 259 15
Brittany 0 259 15
Pettibone, 0 259 15
Lauren 0 259 15
Southern 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
Lutz 0 259 15
Bachmann 0 259 15
from 0 259 15
entering, 0 259 15
all 0 259 15
for 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
crime 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
opposing 0 259 15
jihad 0 259 15
terror 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
Sharia 0 259 15
oppression, 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
thereby 0 259 15
made 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
clear 0 259 15
that 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
is 0 259 15
more 0 259 15
authoritarian 0 259 15
and 0 259 15
unwilling 0 259 15
to 0 259 15
uphold 0 259 15
the 0 259 15
freedom 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
speech 0 259 15
than 0 259 15
ever 0 259 15
– 0 259 15
at 0 259 15
least 0 259 15
when 0 259 15
it 0 259 15
comes 0 259 15
to 0 259 15
criticism 0 259 15
of 0 259 15
Islam, 0 259 15
Muslim 1 259 15
rape 1 259 15
gangs, 1 259 15
and 0 259 15
mass 0 259 15
Muslim 0 259 15
migration. 0 259 15

Even 0 259 16
worse, 0 259 16
the 0 259 16
bannings 0 259 16
of 0 259 16
Sellner, 0 259 16
Pettibone, 0 259 16
Southern, 0 259 16
and 0 259 16
Bachmann 0 259 16
were 0 259 16
just 0 259 16
part 0 259 16
of 0 259 16
a 0 259 16
long 0 259 16
pattern. 0 259 16

Pamela 0 259 17
Geller 0 259 17
and 0 259 17
I 0 259 17
were 0 259 17
banned 0 259 17
from 0 259 17
entering 0 259 17
Britain 0 259 17
in 0 259 17
2013, 0 259 17
apparently 0 259 17
for 0 259 17
life, 0 259 17
also 0 259 17
for 0 259 17
the 0 259 17
crime 0 259 17
of 0 259 17
telling 0 259 17
the 1 259 17
truth 1 259 17
about 1 259 17
Islam 1 259 17
and 1 259 17
jihad. 1 259 17

Meanwhile, 0 259 18
Britain 0 259 18
has 0 259 18
a 0 259 18
steadily 0 259 18
lengthening 0 259 18
record 0 259 18
of 0 259 18
admitting 0 259 18
jihad 0 259 18
preachers 0 259 18
without 1 259 18
a 1 259 18
moment 1 259 18
of 1 259 18
hesitation. 1 259 18

Syed 0 259 19
Muzaffar 0 259 19
Shah 0 259 19
Qadri’s 0 259 19
preaching 1 259 19
of 1 259 19
hatred 1 259 19
and 1 259 19
jihad 1 259 19
violence 1 259 19
was 0 259 19
so 0 259 19
hardline 1 259 19
that 0 259 19
he 0 259 19
was 0 259 19
banned 0 259 19
from 0 259 19
preaching 0 259 19
in 0 259 19
Pakistan, 0 259 19
but 0 259 19
the 0 259 19
UK 0 259 19
Home 0 259 19
Office 0 259 19
welcomed 0 259 19
him 0 259 19
into 0 259 19
Britain. 0 259 19

The 0 259 20
UK 0 259 20
Home 0 259 20
Office 0 259 20
also 0 259 20
admitted 0 259 20
Shaykh 0 259 20
Hamza 0 259 20
Sodagar 0 259 20
into 0 259 20
the 0 259 20
country, 0 259 20
despite 0 259 20
the 0 259 20
fact 0 259 20
that 0 259 20
he 0 259 20
has 0 259 20
said: 0 259 20
“If 0 259 20
there’s 0 259 20
homosexual 0 259 20
men, 0 259 20
the 0 259 20
punishment 0 259 20
is 0 259 20
one 0 259 20
of 0 259 20
five 0 259 20
things. 0 259 20

One 0 259 21
– 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
easiest 0 259 21
one 0 259 21
maybe 0 259 21
– 0 259 21
chop 0 259 21
their 0 259 21
head 0 259 21
off, 0 259 21
that’s 0 259 21
the 0 259 21
easiest. 0 259 21

Second 0 259 22
– 0 259 22
burn 0 259 22
them 0 259 22
to 0 259 22
death. 0 259 22

Third 0 259 23
– 0 259 23
throw 0 259 23
’em 0 259 23
off 0 259 23
a 0 259 23
cliff. 0 259 23

Fourth 0 259 24
– 0 259 24
tear 0 259 24
down 0 259 24
a 0 259 24
wall 0 259 24
on 0 259 24
them 0 259 24
so 0 259 24
they 0 259 24
die 0 259 24
under 0 259 24
that. 0 259 24

Fifth 0 259 25
– 0 259 25
a 0 259 25
combination 0 259 25
of 0 259 25
the 0 259 25
above.” 0 259 25

Theresa 0 259 26
May’s 0 259 26
relentlessly 1 259 26
appeasement-minded 1 259 26
government 0 259 26
also 0 259 26
admitted 0 259 26
two 0 259 26
jihad 0 259 26
preachers 0 259 26
who 0 259 26
had 0 259 26
praised 0 259 26
the 0 259 26
murderer 0 259 26
of 0 259 26
a 0 259 26
foe 0 259 26
of 0 259 26
Pakistan’s 0 259 26
blasphemy 0 259 26
laws. 0 259 26

One 0 259 27
of 0 259 27
them 0 259 27
was 0 259 27
welcomed 0 259 27
by 0 259 27
the 0 259 27
Archbishop 0 259 27
of 0 259 27
Canterbury. 0 259 27

Meanwhile, 0 259 28
the 0 259 28
UK 0 259 28
banned 0 259 28
three 0 259 28
bishops 0 259 28
from 0 259 28
areas 0 259 28
of 0 259 28
Iraq 0 259 28
and 0 259 28
Syria 0 259 28
where 0 259 28
Christians 0 259 28
are 0 259 28
persecuted 0 259 28
from 0 259 28
entering 0 259 28
the 0 259 28
country. 0 259 28

But 0 259 29
now 0 259 29
matters 0 259 29
are 0 259 29
coming 0 259 29
to 0 259 29
a 0 259 29
head. 0 259 29

Apparently 0 259 30
British 0 259 30
authorities 0 259 30
decided 0 259 30
that 0 259 30
it 0 259 30
would 0 259 30
be 0 259 30
too 0 259 30
politically 0 259 30
costly 0 259 30
for 0 259 30
them 0 259 30
to 0 259 30
bar 0 259 30
Wilders 0 259 30
again. 0 259 30

And 0 259 31
so 0 259 31
he 0 259 31
entered, 0 259 31
and 0 259 31
spoke, 0 259 31
and 0 259 31
gave 0 259 31
them 0 259 31
a 0 259 31
strong 0 259 31
dose 0 259 31
of 0 259 31
the 0 259 31
reality 1 259 31
that 0 259 31
they 0 259 31
are 0 259 31
determined 0 259 31
to 0 259 31
ignore 0 259 31
and 0 259 31
deny. 0 259 31

Tommy 0 259 32
Robinson 0 259 32
is 0 259 32
in 0 259 32
prison 0 259 32
today 0 259 32
because 0 259 32
he 0 259 32
violated 0 259 32
a 0 259 32
court 0 259 32
order 0 259 32
demanding 0 259 32
that 0 259 32
he 0 259 32
not 0 259 32
film 0 259 32
videos 0 259 32
outside 0 259 32
the 0 259 32
trials 0 259 32
of 0 259 32
Muslim 1 259 32
rape 1 259 32
gangs. 1 259 32

Clearly 0 259 33
the 1 259 33
government’s 1 259 33
intent 1 259 33
was 1 259 33
to 1 259 33
make 1 259 33
sure 1 259 33
that 1 259 33
as 1 259 33
few 1 259 33
people 1 259 33
as 1 259 33
possible 1 259 33
discovered 1 259 33
the 1 259 33
truth 1 259 33
about 0 259 33
its 0 259 33
massive, 0 259 33
years-long 0 259 33
cover-up 0 259 33
of 0 259 33
those 0 259 33
rape 1 259 33
gangs, 1 259 33
and 0 259 33
refusal 0 259 33
to 0 259 33
prosecute 0 259 33
the 0 259 33
perpetrators. 0 259 33

Theresa 0 259 34
May 0 259 34
and 0 259 34
company 0 259 34
obvious 0 259 34
hope 0 259 34
that 0 259 34
other 0 259 34
Britons 0 259 34
who 0 259 34
are 0 259 34
furious 0 259 34
about 0 259 34
the 0 259 34
sacrifice 1 259 34
of 1 259 34
thousands 1 259 34
of 0 259 34
British 1 259 34
girls 1 259 34
to 0 259 34
the 0 259 34
idols 0 259 34
of 0 259 34
“diversity” 0 259 34
and 0 259 34
“multiculturalism” 0 259 34
will 0 259 34
see 0 259 34
what 0 259 34
happened 0 259 34
to 0 259 34
Tommy, 0 259 34
and 0 259 34
be 0 259 34
frightened 0 259 34
into 0 259 34
silence. 0 259 34

The 0 259 35
British 0 259 35
government, 0 259 35
in 0 259 35
imprisoning 0 259 35
Tommy 0 259 35
Robinson, 0 259 35
has 0 259 35
shown 0 259 35
itself 0 259 35
willing 0 259 35
to 0 259 35
incarcerate 0 259 35
people 0 259 35
for 0 259 35
having 0 259 35
opinions 0 259 35
that 0 259 35
it 0 259 35
considers 0 259 35
unacceptable. 0 259 35

That 0 259 36
heralds 0 259 36
the 1 259 36
death 1 259 36
of 1 259 36
Britain 1 259 36
as 1 259 36
a 1 259 36
free 1 259 36
society 1 259 36
and 0 259 36
the 0 259 36
beginning 1 259 36
of 1 259 36
an 1 259 36
authoritarian 1 259 36
police 1 259 36
state 1 259 36
there, 0 259 36
unless 1 259 36
this 1 259 36
slide 1 259 36
to 1 259 36
totalitarianism 1 259 36
is 1 259 36
stopped 1 259 36
now. 1 259 36

British 0 259 37
public 0 259 37
figures, 0 259 37
whatever 0 259 37
criticism 0 259 37
they 0 259 37
have 0 259 37
leveled 0 259 37
against 0 259 37
Tommy 0 259 37
Robinson 0 259 37
in 0 259 37
the 0 259 37
past, 0 259 37
should 0 259 37
be 0 259 37
calling 0 259 37
for 0 259 37
him 0 259 37
to 0 259 37
be 0 259 37
freed 0 259 37
today, 0 259 37
or 1 259 37
else 1 259 37
they 1 259 37
will 1 259 37
be 1 259 37
exposing 1 259 37
themselves 1 259 37
as 1 259 37
supporting 1 259 37
the 1 259 37
degeneration 1 259 37
of 1 259 37
Britain 1 259 37
into 0 259 37
a 0 259 37
police 0 259 37
state. 0 259 37

Wilders 0 259 38
addressed 0 259 38
this 0 259 38
endeavor 0 259 38
head-on, 0 259 38
declaring: 0 259 38
“We 1 259 38
will 1 259 38
not 1 259 38
be 1 259 38
silenced. 1 259 38

We 1 259 39
will 1 259 39
not 1 259 39
be 1 259 39
intimidated. 1 259 39

And 1 259 40
we 1 259 40
tell 1 259 40
the 1 259 40
governments, 1 259 40
we 1 259 40
are 1 259 40
not 1 259 40
afraid 1 259 40
of 1 259 40
you. 1 259 40

We 1 259 41
will 1 259 41
never 1 259 41
surrender. 1 259 41

We 1 259 42
will 1 259 42
stand 1 259 42
strong 1 259 42
and 1 259 42
do 1 259 42
our 1 259 42
duty. 1 259 42

We 1 259 43
will 1 259 43
defend 1 259 43
our 1 259 43
civilization. 1 259 43

And 1 259 44
we 1 259 44
will 1 259 44
protect 1 259 44
our 1 259 44
people.” 1 259 44

Wilders 0 259 45
added: 0 259 45
“And 0 259 45
I 0 259 45
tell 0 259 45
you, 0 259 45
to 0 259 45
the 0 259 45
governments. 0 259 45

You 0 259 46
can 0 259 46
throw 0 259 46
us 0 259 46
in 0 259 46
jail, 0 259 46
but 0 259 46
you 0 259 46
will 0 259 46
never 0 259 46
defeat 0 259 46
us. 0 259 46

Because, 0 259 47
my 0 259 47
friends, 0 259 47
for 0 259 47
every 0 259 47
Tommy 0 259 47
whom 0 259 47
you 0 259 47
imprison, 0 259 47
thousands 0 259 47
will 0 259 47
rise 0 259 47
up. 0 259 47

So 0 259 48
take 1 259 48
notice, 1 259 48
Theresa 0 259 48
May. 0 259 48

Take 1 259 49
notice, 1 259 49
Dutch 0 259 49
Prime 0 259 49
Minister 0 259 49
Rutte. 0 259 49

Take 1 259 50
notice, 1 259 50
Mrs. 0 259 50
Merkel 0 259 50
or 0 259 50
President 0 259 50
Macron. 0 259 50

Take 1 259 51
notice: 1 259 51
the 1 259 51
future 1 259 51
is 1 259 51
ours 1 259 51
and 1 259 51
not 1 259 51
yours. 1 259 51

We 0 259 52
will 0 259 52
defeat 0 259 52
you 0 259 52
politically, 0 259 52
because 0 259 52
we, 0 259 52
my 0 259 52
friends, 0 259 52
we 1 259 52
are 1 259 52
the 1 259 52
people.” 1 259 52

If 1 259 53
Wilders’ 1 259 53
words 1 259 53
don’t 1 259 53
prove 1 259 53
true, 1 259 53

Mr. 0 263 7

focused 0 263 7
on 0 263 7
process 0 263 7
and 0 263 7
procedures. 0 263 7

The 0 263 8
inspector 0 263 8
general 0 263 8
made 0 263 8
clear 0 263 8
when 0 263 8
he 0 263 8
launched 0 263 8
his 0 263 8
investigation 0 263 8

2017 0 263 8
that 0 263 8
“his 0 263 8

not 0 263 8
substitute 0 263 8

for 0 263 8
the 0 263 8

Moreover, 0 263 9
this 0 263 9

the 0 263 9
OIG 0 263 9
is 0 263 9
investigating 0 263 9
separately. 0 263 9

In 0 263 10
analyzing 0 263 10
the 0 263 10
highly 0 263 10
anticipated 0 263 10

report’s 0 263 10
conclusions, 0 263 10
it 0 263 10
is 0 263 10
clear 0 263 10
that 0 263 10
either 0 263 10
Mr. 0 263 10
Horowitz 0 263 10
himself 0 263 10
decided 0 263 10
to 0 263 10
pull 0 263 10
his 0 263 10
punches 0 263 10
or 0 263 10
that 0 263 10
the 0 263 10
final 0 263 10
version, 0 263 10
which 0 263 10
had 0 263 10
been 0 263 10
reviewed 0 263 10
by 0 263 10
upper 0 263 10

before 0 263 10
its 0 263 10

emerged 1 263 10
in 1 263 10
a 1 263 10
disappointingly 1 263 10
watered-down 1 263 10
form. 1 263 10

To 0 263 11
be 0 263 11
sure, 0 263 11
the 0 263 11
report 0 263 11
faulted 0 263 11
Comey 0 263 11
for 0 263 11
deviating 0 263 11

thereby 0 263 11
negatively 0 263 11
impacting 0 263 11
“the 0 263 11

according 0 263 11
to 0 263 11
the 0 263 11

even 0 263 11
if 0 263 11
it 0 263 11

Starting 0 263 12
with 0 263 12
Comey’s 0 263 12

on 0 263 12

for 0 263 12
being 0 263 12
“extremely 1 263 12

their 0 263 12

very 0 263 12

highly 0 263 12
classified 0 263 12
information,” 0 263 12
but 0 263 12
also 0 263 12
announcing 0 263 12
that 0 263 12
the 0 263 12

was 0 263 12
“expressing 0 263 12

in 0 263 12
this 0 263 12

Comey 0 263 12
was 0 263 12
taken 0 263 12
to 0 263 12
task 0 263 12
for 0 263 12
insubordination 0 263 12

usurping 0 263 12
the 0 263 12
authority 0 263 12
of 0 263 12
the 0 263 12
attorney 0 263 12

He 0 263 13
“upset 0 263 13

the 0 263 13

said. 0 263 13

Comey’s 0 263 14
follow-up 0 263 14

2016 0 263 14
were 0 263 14
similarly 0 263 14
criticized. 0 263 14

The 0 263 15
first 0 263 15
letter 0 263 15
informed 0 263 15

This 0 263 16

on 0 263 16
November 0 263 16
6, 0 263 16
2016 0 263 16
by 0 263 16
Comey’s 0 263 16
statement 0 263 16
that 0 263 16
the 0 263 16
review 0 263 16
of 0 263 16
the 0 263 16
additional 0 263 16
information 0 263 16
had 0 263 16
been 0 263 16
completed 0 263 16
and 0 263 16
that 0 263 16
the 0 263 16

that 0 263 16
charges 0 263 16

Comey 0 263 17

the 0 263 17
way 0 263 17
he 0 263 17
did. 0 263 17

The 0 263 18
OIG 0 263 18
report 0 263 18
was 0 263 18
highly 0 263 18
critical 0 263 18
of 0 263 18
the 0 263 18
FBI’s 0 263 18
failure 0 263 18
to 0 263 18

rather 0 263 18
than 0 263 18
waiting 0 263 18
another 0 263 18

close 0 263 18
to 0 263 18

The 0 263 19

of 0 263 19
Comey's 0 263 19
undisciplined 0 263 19

was 0 263 19
all 0 263 19
well 0 263 19
and 0 263 19
good, 0 263 19
but 0 263 19
it 0 263 19
was 0 263 19
reasonable 0 263 19
to 0 263 19

Hillary 0 263 20
Clinton’s 0 263 20
supporters 0 263 20
will 0 263 20
no 0 263 20
doubt 0 263 20
jump 0 263 20
on 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
inspector 0 263 20
general’s 0 263 20
criticisms 0 263 20
of 0 263 20
Comey’s 0 263 20
handling 0 263 20
of 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
July 0 263 20
5th 0 263 20
announcement 0 263 20
and 0 263 20
subsequent 0 263 20
letters 0 263 20
as 0 263 20
proof 0 263 20
that 0 263 20
he 0 263 20
improperly 0 263 20
influenced 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
outcome 0 263 20
of 0 263 20
the 0 263 20
election 0 263 20
in 0 263 20
President 0 263 20
Trump’s 0 263 20
favor, 0 263 20
even 0 263 20
if 0 263 20
he 0 263 20
did 0 263 20
not 0 263 20
do 0 263 20
so 0 263 20
deliberately 0 263 20
for 0 263 20
political 0 263 20
reasons. 0 263 20

However, 0 263 21
what 0 263 21
Comey 0 263 21
really 0 263 21
did 0 263 21
was 0 263 21
to 0 263 21
give 1 263 21
Hillary 1 263 21
Clinton 1 263 21
a 1 263 21

The 0 263 22
fix 0 263 22
was 0 263 22
in 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
early 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
May 0 263 22
2016, 0 263 22
well 0 263 22
before 0 263 22
the 0 263 22
FBI 0 263 22
interviews 0 263 22
of 0 263 22
Hillary 0 263 22

and 0 263 22
of 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
many 0 263 22
as 0 263 22
17 0 263 22
other 0 263 22
key 0 263 22
witnesses, 0 263 22
when 0 263 22
Comey 0 263 22
began 0 263 22
the 0 263 22
process 0 263 22
of 0 263 22
drafting 0 263 22
an 0 263 22
exoneration 0 263 22
memo. 0 263 22

Comey’s 0 263 23
initial 0 263 23
draft 0 263 23
statement, 0 263 23
which 0 263 23
he 0 263 23
shared 0 263 23
with 0 263 23
FBI 0 263 23
senior 0 263 23
leadership 0 263 23
on 0 263 23
May 0 263 23
2, 0 263 23
criticized 0 263 23
Clinton’s 0 263 23
handling 0 263 23
of 0 263 23
classified 0 263 23
information 0 263 23
as 0 263 23
“grossly 1 263 23
negligent,” 1 263 23
but 0 263 23
concluded 0 263 23
that 0 263 23
“no 0 263 23
reasonable 0 263 23
prosecutor” 0 263 23
would 0 263 23
bring 0 263 23
a 0 263 23
case 0 263 23
based 0 263 23
on 0 263 23
the 0 263 23
facts 0 263 23
developed 0 263 23
in 0 263 23
the 0 263 23
investigation. 0 263 23

Indeed, 0 263 24
Comey 0 263 24
admitted 0 263 24
in 0 263 24
his 0 263 24
book 0 263 24
that 0 263 24
“we 0 263 24
started 0 263 24
the 0 263 24
Clinton 0 263 24
investigation 0 263 24
aware 0 263 24
that 0 263 24
it 0 263 24
was 0 263 24
unlikely 0 263 24
to 0 263 24
be 0 263 24
a 0 263 24
case 0 263 24
that 0 263 24
career 0 263 24
prosecutors 0 263 24
at 0 263 24
the 0 263 24
Department 0 263 24
of 0 263 24
Justice 0 263 24
would 0 263 24
prosecute.” 0 263 24

If 0 263 25
putting 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
cart 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
exoneration 0 263 25
before 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
horse 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
investigation 0 263 25
were 0 263 25
not 0 263 25
enough, 0 263 25
Comey’s 0 263 25
draft 0 263 25
statement 0 263 25
underwent 0 263 25
various 0 263 25
language 0 263 25
changes 0 263 25
over 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
course 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
next 0 263 25
two 0 263 25
months, 0 263 25
including, 0 263 25
most 0 263 25
importantly, 0 263 25
changing 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
description 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
Clinton’s 0 263 25
handling 0 263 25
of 0 263 25
classified 0 263 25
information 0 263 25
from 0 263 25
“grossly 1 263 25
negligent” 1 263 25
to 0 263 25
“extremely 1 263 25
careless.” 1 263 25
This 0 263 25
change 0 263 25
was 0 263 25
critical 0 263 25
because 0 263 25
“gross 1 263 25
negligence” 1 263 25
is 0 263 25
specifically 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
legal 0 263 25
term 0 263 25
used 0 263 25
in 0 263 25
stating 0 263 25
the 0 263 25
statutory 0 263 25
requirement 0 263 25
in 0 263 25
18 0 263 25
U.S. 0 263 25

of 0 263 25

conduct. 0 263 25

Comey’s 0 263 26
substitution 0 263 26
of 0 263 26
a 0 263 26
legally 0 263 26
meaningless 0 263 26
phrase, 0 263 26
“extremely 1 263 26
careless,” 1 263 26
for 0 263 26
the 0 263 26
“gross 1 263 26
negligence” 1 263 26
statutory 0 263 26
legal 0 263 26
standard 0 263 26
he 0 263 26
had 0 263 26
originally 0 263 26
used, 0 263 26
had 0 263 26
the 0 263 26

of 0 263 26
prejudging 0 263 26
the 0 263 26

in 0 263 26

were 0 263 27

in 0 263 27
the 0 263 27
edits. 0 263 27

Inspector 0 263 28
General 0 263 28
Horowitz 0 263 28
saw 0 263 28
no 0 263 28
problem 0 263 28
with 0 263 28
this 0 263 28
pattern 0 263 28
of 0 263 28
obfuscation 0 263 28
regarding 0 263 28
the 0 263 28
deletion 0 263 28
of 0 263 28
the 0 263 28
legally 0 263 28
significant 0 263 28
phrase 0 263 28
“gross 1 263 28
negligence” 1 263 28
from 0 263 28
Comey’s 0 263 28
statement. 0 263 28

Mr. 0 263 29
Horowitz 0 263 29
relied 0 263 29
in 0 263 29
part 0 263 29
on 0 263 29
opinions 0 263 29
from 0 263 29
prosecutors 0 263 29
that 0 263 29
there 0 263 29
was 0 263 29
not 0 263 29
enough 0 263 29
evidence 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
charge 0 263 29
Clinton 0 263 29
with 0 263 29
acting 0 263 29
in 0 263 29
a 0 263 29
manner 0 263 29
that 0 263 29
rose 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
a 0 263 29
level 0 263 29
of 0 263 29
criminal 0 263 29
gross 1 263 29
negligence 1 263 29
with 0 263 29
respect 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
sending 0 263 29
or 0 263 29
receiving 0 263 29
e-mails 0 263 29
determined 0 263 29
to 0 263 29
contain 0 263 29
classified 0 263 29
information. 0 263 29

Mr. 0 263 30
Horowitz’s 0 263 30
report 0 263 30
thus 0 263 30
concluded, 0 263 30
“We 0 263 30
did 0 263 30
not 0 263 30
identify 0 263 30
evidence 0 263 30
of 0 263 30
bias 0 263 30
or 0 263 30
improper 0 263 30
considerations.” 0 263 30
This 0 263 30
conclusion 0 263 30
defies 0 263 30
common 0 263 30
sense. 0 263 30

Gross 1 263 31
negligence 1 263 31
is 0 263 31
not 0 263 31
the 0 263 31
same 0 263 31
as 0 263 31
willful 0 263 31
intent, 0 263 31
which 0 263 31
Comey 0 263 31
and 0 263 31
his 0 263 31
team 0 263 31
sought 0 263 31
to 0 263 31
conflate 0 263 31
in 0 263 31
exonerating 0 263 31
Hillary 0 263 31
Clinton 0 263 31
before 0 263 31
the 0 263 31
investigation 0 263 31
was 0 263 31
concluded. 0 263 31

Clinton 0 263 32
was 0 263 32
fully 0 263 32
aware 0 263 32
of 0 263 32
what 0 263 32
she 0 263 32
was 0 263 32
doing 0 263 32
when 0 263 32
she 0 263 32
set 0 263 32
up 0 263 32
the 0 263 32
private 0 263 32
server 0 263 32
arrangement 0 263 32
in 0 263 32
the 0 263 32
first 0 263 32
place 0 263 32
and 0 263 32
knowingly 0 263 32
used 0 263 32
it 0 263 32
to 0 263 32
send 0 263 32
and 0 263 32
receive 0 263 32
e-mails 0 263 32
involving 0 263 32
official 0 263 32
government 0 263 32
business, 0 263 32
which 0 263 32
by 0 263 32
their 0 263 32
very 0 263 32
nature 0 263 32
would 0 263 32
be 0 263 32
expected 0 263 32
to 0 263 32
include 0 263 32
classified 0 263 32
information. 0 263 32

It 0 263 33
turns 0 263 33
out 0 263 33
that 0 263 33
some 0 263 33
of 0 263 33
the 0 263 33
e-mails 0 263 33
were 0 263 33
accessed 0 263 33
by 0 263 33
foreign 0 263 33
parties. 0 263 33

Hillary 0 263 34
lied 0 263 34
repeatedly 0 263 34
when 0 263 34
she 0 263 34
first 0 263 34
denied 0 263 34
there 0 263 34
were 0 263 34
any 0 263 34
classified 0 263 34
e-mails 0 263 34
on 0 263 34
her 0 263 34
system 0 263 34
and 0 263 34
then 0 263 34
described 0 263 34
some 0 263 34
of 0 263 34
the 0 263 34
e-mails 0 263 34
involved 0 263 34
in 0 263 34
the 0 263 34
investigation 0 263 34
as 0 263 34
having 0 263 34
been 0 263 34
classified 0 263 34
after 0 263 34
the 0 263 34
fact. 0 263 34

As 0 263 35
Comey 0 263 35
has 0 263 35
admitted, 0 263 35
several 0 263 35
e-mail 0 263 35
chains 0 263 35
concerned 0 263 35
matters 0 263 35
that 0 263 35
were 0 263 35
classified 0 263 35
at 0 263 35
the 0 263 35
Top 0 263 35
Secret/Special 0 263 35
Access 0 263 35
Program 0 263 35
level 0 263 35
when 0 263 35
they 0 263 35
were 0 263 35
sent 0 263 35
and 0 263 35
received 0 263 35
by 0 263 35
Clinton. 0 263 35

Coupled 0 263 36
with 0 263 36
her 0 263 36
agents’ 0 263 36
destruction 0 263 36
of 0 263 36
thousands 0 263 36
of 0 263 36
e-mails 0 263 36
that 0 263 36
had 0 263 36
been 0 263 36
subpoenaed 0 263 36
by 0 263 36
Congress, 0 263 36
Hillary’s 0 263 36
conduct 0 263 36
was 0 263 36
criminally 1 263 36
reckless 1 263 36
at 0 263 36
the 0 263 36
very 0 263 36
least, 0 263 36
if 0 263 36
not 0 263 36
constituting 0 263 36
willful 1 263 36
intent 1 263 36
to 1 263 36
commit 1 263 36
an 1 263 36
act 1 263 36
she 1 263 36
knew 1 263 36
was 1 263 36
wrongful. 1 263 36

Yet 0 263 37
Mr. 0 263 37
Horowitz 0 263 37
saw 0 263 37
no 0 263 37
reason 0 263 37
to 0 263 37
doubt 0 263 37
the 0 263 37
sincerity 0 263 37
of 0 263 37
Comey's 0 263 37
explanations 0 263 37
for 0 263 37
giving 0 263 37
Hillary 0 263 37
a 0 263 37
free 0 263 37
pass. 0 263 37

The 0 263 38
failure 0 263 38
to 0 263 38
at 0 263 38
least 0 263 38
empanel 0 263 38
a 0 263 38
grand 0 263 38
jury 0 263 38
to 0 263 38
compel 0 263 38
testimony 0 263 38
from 0 263 38
Hillary 0 263 38
Clinton 0 263 38
and 0 263 38
key 0 263 38
witnesses 0 263 38
was 0 263 38
itself 0 263 38
a 0 263 38
complete 0 263 38
dereliction 0 263 38
of 0 263 38
duty, 0 263 38
which 0 263 38
could 0 263 38
have 0 263 38
only 0 263 38
been 0 263 38
motivated 0 263 38
by 0 263 38
a 0 263 38
desire 0 263 38
to 0 263 38
treat 1 263 38
Hillary 1 263 38
Clinton 1 263 38
with 1 263 38
kid 1 263 38
gloves 1 263 38
for 0 263 38
improper 0 263 38
reasons. 0 263 38

Incredibly, 0 263 39
however, 0 263 39
Mr. 0 263 39
Horowitz’s 0 263 39
report 0 263 39
“found 0 263 39
no 0 263 39

the 0 263 39
outcome 0 263 39
of 0 263 39
the 0 263 39

would 0 263 39
have 0 263 39
been 0 263 39

Mr. 0 263 40

also 0 263 40
did 0 263 40
not 0 263 40
deem 0 263 40
Comey’s 0 263 40
possible 0 263 40
perjury 0 263 40
in 0 263 40
his 0 263 40
testimony 0 263 40
before 0 263 40
Congress 0 263 40

Comey 0 263 41

before 0 263 41
her 0 263 41

it 0 263 41

Mr. 0 263 42
Horowitz 0 263 42
simply 0 263 42
took 0 263 42
Comey’s 0 263 42
word 0 263 42
for 0 263 42
what 0 263 42
he 0 263 42

meant. 0 263 42

Inspector 0 263 43

discussed 0 263 44
in 0 263 44
the 0 263 44

but 0 263 44
mostly 0 263 44
in 0 263 44
the 0 263 44
context 0 263 44
of 0 263 44
how 0 263 44
it 0 263 44
affected 0 263 44

all 0 263 45
Mr. 0 263 45
Horowitz’s 0 263 45
report 0 263 45
had 0 263 45
to 0 263 45
say 0 263 45
was 0 263 45
that 0 263 45
it 0 263 45
was 0 263 45
“an 0 263 45
error 0 263 45

judgment.” 0 263 45

The 0 263 46
OIG 0 263 46

sharply 1 263 46
critical 1 263 46
of 1 263 46

before 0 263 46

after 0 263 46

2016, 0 263 46
in 0 263 46
which 0 263 46
Strzok 0 263 46
reassured 0 263 46

that 0 263 46

Strzok. 0 263 49

“No. 0 263 50

We’ll 0 263 52
stop 0 263 52
it,” 0 263 52
Strzok 0 263 52
responded. 0 263 52

Mr. 0 263 53
Horowitz 0 263 53
wrote 0 263 53
that 0 263 53
this 0 263 53
exchange 0 263 53
was 0 263 53
“not 0 263 53
only 0 263 53
indicative 0 263 53
of 0 263 53
a 0 263 53
biased 0 263 53
state 0 263 53
of 0 263 53
mind 0 263 53
but, 0 263 53
even 0 263 53
more 0 263 53
seriously, 0 263 53
implies 0 263 53
a 0 263 53
willingness 0 263 53
to 0 263 53
take 0 263 53

the 0 263 53

electoral 0 263 53
prospects.” 0 263 53
The 0 263 53
inspector 0 263 53
general 0 263 53
questioned 0 263 53
whether 0 263 53
Strzok’s 0 263 53
decision 0 263 53
to 0 263 53
prioritize 0 263 53
the 0 263 53
Russia 0 263 53

discovered 0 263 53
on 0 263 53
the 0 263 53

was 0 263 53
free 0 263 53
from 0 263 53

Ultimately, 0 263 54
however, 0 263 54
he 0 263 54
inexplicably 1 263 54
concluded 1 263 54
that 0 263 54
there 0 263 54
was 0 263 54
no 0 263 54

only 1 266 4

down 0 266 9
on 0 266 9
that 0 266 9

It's 0 266 10
particularly 1 266 10
stupid 1 266 10
of 0 266 10
Michael 0 266 10
Hayden 0 266 10
to 0 266 10

Repeatedly. 0 266 11

You 0 266 12
might 0 266 12
think 0 266 12
that 0 266 12
would 0 266 12
have 0 266 12

But 0 266 13
instead 0 266 13
it 0 266 13
seems 0 266 13
to 0 266 13
have 0 266 13

British 0 267 1
politician 0 267 1
Nigel 0 267 1
Farage 0 267 1
once 0 267 1
helped 0 267 1
convince 0 267 1

to 0 267 1
vote 0 267 1
for 0 267 1

separate 0 267 1
from 0 267 1
the 0 267 1
European 0 267 1
Union, 0 267 1
but 1 267 1
British 1 267 1
establishment 1 267 1
politicians 1 267 1
have 1 267 1
done 1 267 1
everything 1 267 1
they 1 267 1
could 1 267 1
to 1 267 1
sabotage 1 267 1
that 1 267 1
vote 1 267 1
since 1 267 1
then. 1 267 1

Now 0 267 2
Farage 0 267 2
has 0 267 2
apparently 0 267 2
decided 0 267 2
that 0 267 2
if 1 267 2

regarding 0 267 2
the 1 267 2

threat.’ 1 267 2

At 0 267 3
a 0 267 3
recent 0 267 3
dinner 0 267 3
of 0 267 3
the 0 267 3
UK 0 267 3
Independence 0 267 3
Party 0 267 3
(UKIP), 0 267 3
which 0 267 3
he 0 267 3
formerly 0 267 3
headed, 0 267 3
Farage 0 267 3
said: 0 267 3
“If 1 267 3
dealing 1 267 3
with 1 267 3
Islamic 1 267 3
fundamentalism 1 267 3
becomes 1 267 3
a 1 267 3
battle 1 267 3
between 1 267 3
us 1 267 3
and 1 267 3
the 1 267 3

I’ll 1 267 3
tell 1 267 3
you 1 267 3
the 1 267 3
result: 1 267 3
we’ll 1 267 3
lose. 1 267 3

We 1 267 4
will 1 267 4
simply 1 267 4
lose….We 1 267 4
absolutely 1 267 4
have 1 267 4
to 1 267 4

that 1 267 4

on 1 267 4

side, 1 267 4
more 1 267 4
attuned 1 267 4
to 1 267 4
Western 1 267 4
values 1 267 4
than 1 267 4
some 1 267 4
pretty 1 267 4
hardline 1 267 4
interpretations 1 267 4
of 1 267 4

Sure. 1 267 5

Now 0 267 6
how 0 267 6
does 0 267 6
Farage 0 267 6
propose 0 267 6
to 0 267 6

that? 0 267 6

His 0 267 7

is 0 267 7
odd. 0 267 7

No 1 267 8
sane 1 267 8
person 1 267 8
is 1 267 8
saying 1 267 8
that 1 267 8

if 1 267 20
we 1 267 20
don’t 1 267 20

about 1 267 20

Another 1 267 21
problem 1 267 21
with 1 267 21
Farage’s 1 267 21
statement 1 267 21
is 1 267 21
that 1 267 21
it 1 267 21
manifests 1 267 21
a 1 267 21
remarkable 1 267 21
ignorance 1 267 21
of 1 267 21
history. 1 267 21

While 1 267 22
he 1 267 22
is 1 267 22
deeply 1 267 22
concerned 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
British 1 267 22
people 1 267 22
not 1 267 22
begin 1 267 22
to 1 267 22
think 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
resisting 1 267 22
jihad 1 267 22
terror 1 267 22
means 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
they 1 267 22
are 1 267 22
in 1 267 22
a 1 267 22
“battle” 1 267 22
with 1 267 22
the 1 267 22
“entire 1 267 22
religion” 1 267 22
of 1 267 22
Islam, 1 267 22
he 1 267 22
appears 1 267 22
unaware 1 267 22
of 1 267 22
the 1 267 22
fact 1 267 22
that 1 267 22
many 1 267 22
Muslims 1 267 22
throughout 1 267 22
history 1 267 22
have 1 267 22
considered 1 267 22
their 1 267 22
entire 1 267 22
religion 1 267 22
to 1 267 22

Yazdi, 1 267 24
a 1 267 24
fifteenth-century 1 267 24
Persian 1 267 24
who 1 267 24
wrote 1 267 24
a 1 267 24
biography 1 267 24
of 1 267 24
the 1 267 24
Mongol 1 267 24
Muslim 1 267 24
warrior 1 267 24
Tamerlane, 1 267 24
observed 1 267 24
that 1 267 24
“the 1 267 24

says 1 267 24
the 1 267 24
highest 1 267 24

that 1 267 24
of 1 267 24

against 1 267 24
the 1 267 24
enemies 1 267 24
of 1 267 24
his 1 267 24
religion. 1 267 24

Muhammad 1 267 25
advises 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
same 1 267 25
thing, 1 267 25
according 1 267 25
to 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
tradition 1 267 25
of 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
Muslim 1 267 25
doctors: 1 267 25
wherefore 0 267 25
the 0 267 25
great 0 267 25
Temur 0 267 25
always 0 267 25
strove 0 267 25
to 1 267 25
exterminate 1 267 25
the 1 267 25
infidels, 1 267 25
as 0 267 25
much 0 267 25
to 0 267 25
acquire 0 267 25
that 0 267 25
glory, 0 267 25
as 0 267 25
to 0 267 25
signalise 0 267 25
himself 0 267 25
by 0 267 25
the 0 267 25
greatness 0 267 25
of 0 267 25
his 0 267 25
conquests.” 0 267 25

After 0 267 26
conquest 0 267 26
came 0 267 26
dhimmitude, 0 267 26
the 0 267 26
subjugated 0 267 26
status 0 267 26
that 0 267 26
the 0 267 26
Qur’an 0 267 26
mandates 0 267 26
for 0 267 26
“the 1 267 26

(primarily 0 267 26
Jews 0 267 26
and 0 267 26
Christians). 0 267 26

In 0 267 27

an 1 267 28

a 0 267 31
deep 0 267 31

O 1 267 33
you 1 267 33
who 1 267 33
believe! 1 267 33

The 1 267 34
non-Muslims 1 267 34
are 1 267 34
nothing 1 267 34
but 1 267 34
dirt. 1 267 34

Allah 1 267 35
has 1 267 35
created 1 267 35
them 1 267 35
to 1 267 35
be 1 267 35
partisans 1 267 35
of 1 267 35
Satan; 1 267 35
most 1 267 35
treacherous 1 267 35
in 1 267 35
regard 1 267 35
to 1 267 35
all 1 267 35
they 1 267 35
do; 1 267 35
whose 1 267 35

endeavor 1 267 35
in 1 267 35
this 1 267 35
nether 1 267 35
life 1 267 35
is 1 267 35

work. 1 267 35

Upon 1 267 36
them 1 267 36
rests 1 267 36
the 1 267 36

of 1 267 36
Allah, 1 267 36

Angels 1 267 36
and 1 267 36
of 1 267 36

collectively 1 267 36

We 0 267 37
must 0 267 37
not 0 267 37
think 0 267 37
that 0 267 37
we 0 267 37
are 0 267 37
at 1 267 37
war 1 267 37
with 1 267 37

But 1 267 38
what, 1 267 38
Mr. 1 267 38
Farage, 1 267 38
are 1 267 38
we 1 267 38

the 1 267 38

In 0 293 17
2013, 0 293 17
Wilson 0 293 17
had 0 293 17
the 0 293 17
information 0 293 17
on 0 293 17
how 0 293 17
to 0 293 17
build 0 293 17
the 0 293 17
gun 0 293 17
removed 0 293 17
from 0 293 17
public 0 293 17
access 0 293 17
at 0 293 17
the 0 293 17
request 0 293 17
of 0 293 17
the 0 293 17
United 0 293 17
States 0 293 17
Department 0 293 17
of 0 293 17
Defense 0 293 17
Trade 0 293 17
Controls. 0 293 17

According 0 293 18
to 0 293 18
Wilson, 0 293 18
they 0 293 18
seized 0 293 18
control 0 293 18
of 0 293 18
the 0 293 18
information. 0 293 18

Clearly, 1 293 19
they 1 293 19
were 1 293 19
acting 1 293 19
unlawfully 1 293 19
when 1 293 19
they 1 293 19
did 1 293 19
what 1 293 19
they 1 293 19
did. 1 293 19

"I 0 293 20
thought 1 293 20
my 1 293 20
life 1 293 20
was 1 293 20
over," 1 293 20
Wilson 0 293 20
said 0 293 20
after 0 293 20
his 0 293 20
attorneys 0 293 20
told 0 293 20
him 0 293 20
he 0 293 20
didn't 0 293 20
fair 0 293 20
well 0 293 20
going 0 293 20
up 0 293 20
against 0 293 20
the 0 293 20
government. 0 293 20

So, 0 293 21
what 0 293 21
did 0 293 21
he 0 293 21
do? 0 293 21

He 0 293 22
fired 0 293 22
them, 0 293 22
and 0 293 22
got 0 293 22
a 0 293 22
new 0 293 22
legal 0 293 22
team. 0 293 22

Wired 0 293 23
has 0 293 23
the 0 293 23
story. 0 293 23

Instead, 0 293 24
Wilson 0 293 24
has 0 293 24
spent 0 293 24
the 0 293 24
last 0 293 24
years 0 293 24
on 0 293 24
an 0 293 24
unlikely 0 293 24
project 0 293 24
for 0 293 24
an 1 293 24
anarchist: 1 293 24
Not 0 293 24
simply 0 293 24
defying 0 293 24
or 0 293 24
skirting 0 293 24
the 0 293 24
law 0 293 24
but 0 293 24
taking 0 293 24
it 0 293 24
to 0 293 24
court 0 293 24
and 0 293 24
changing 0 293 24
it. 0 293 24

In 0 293 25
doing 0 293 25
so, 0 293 25
he 0 293 25
has 0 293 25
now 0 293 25
not 0 293 25
only 0 293 25
defeated 0 293 25
a 0 293 25
legal 0 293 25
threat 0 293 25
to 0 293 25
his 0 293 25
own 0 293 25
highly 0 293 25
controversial 0 293 25
gunsmithing 0 293 25
project. 0 293 25

He 0 293 26
may 0 293 26
have 0 293 26
also 0 293 26
unlocked 0 293 26
a 0 293 26
new 0 293 26
era 0 293 26
of 0 293 26
digital 0 293 26
DIY 0 293 26
gunmaking 0 293 26
that 0 293 26
further 0 293 26
undermines 0 293 26
gun 0 293 26
control 0 293 26
across 0 293 26
the 0 293 26
United 0 293 26
States 0 293 26
and 0 293 26
the 0 293 26
world—another 0 293 26
step 0 293 26
toward 0 293 26
Wilson's 0 293 26
imagined 0 293 26
future 0 293 26
where 0 293 26
anyone 1 293 26
can 1 293 26
make 1 293 26
a 1 293 26
deadly 1 293 26
weapon 1 293 26
at 1 293 26
home 1 293 26
with 1 293 26
no 1 293 26
government 1 293 26
oversight. 1 293 26

the 0 293 27
Department 0 293 27
of 0 293 27

quietly 0 293 27
offered 0 293 27
Wilson 0 293 27
a 0 293 27
settlement 0 293 27
to 0 293 27
end 0 293 27
a 0 293 27
lawsuit 0 293 27

and 0 293 27
a 0 293 27
group 0 293 27
of 0 293 27
co-plaintiffs 0 293 27

Wilson 0 293 28
and 0 293 28
his 0 293 28
team 0 293 28
of 0 293 28

the 0 293 28
State 0 293 28

was 0 293 28
not 0 293 28
only 0 293 28
violating 0 293 28
his 0 293 28
right 0 293 28

Wilson 0 293 29
had 0 293 29
also 0 293 29
successfully 0 293 29
blurred 0 293 29
the 0 293 29

to 0 293 30
WIRED 0 293 30
when 0 293 30

“For 0 293 43

What 0 293 48
does 0 293 48
all 0 293 48
this 0 293 48
mean? 0 293 48

Well, 0 293 49
it's 0 293 49
pretty 0 293 49
simple, 0 293 49
and 1 293 49
I 1 293 49
highly 1 293 49
recommend 1 293 49
the 1 293 49
Wired 1 293 49
article, 1 293 49
which 1 293 49
is 1 293 49
quite 1 293 49
lengthy 1 293 49
and 1 293 49
has 1 293 49
lots 1 293 49
of 1 293 49
information, 1 293 49
but 0 293 49
what 0 293 49
this 0 293 49
does 0 293 49
is 0 293 49
demonstrates 0 293 49
that 0 293 49
the 1 293 49
genie 1 293 49
is 1 293 49
out 1 293 49
of 1 293 49
the 1 293 49
bottle 1 293 49
and 0 293 49
there 0 293 49
is 0 293 49
just 0 293 49
no 0 293 49
way 0 293 49
for 0 293 49
gun 1 293 49
grabbing 1 293 49
Communists 1 293 49
the 0 293 49
world 0 293 49
over 0 293 49
to 0 293 49
be 0 293 49
able 0 293 49
to 0 293 49
truly 0 293 49
enforce 0 293 49
their 0 293 49
unlawful 0 293 49
acts 0 293 49
of 0 293 49
fun 1 293 49
gun 1 293 49
confiscation. 1 293 49

Why? 0 293 50

Because 0 293 51
now, 0 293 51
anyone 0 293 51
with 0 293 51
access 0 293 51
to 0 293 51
the 0 293 51
internet 0 293 51
and 0 293 51
a 0 293 51
3D 0 293 51
printer 0 293 51
can 0 293 51
print 0 293 51
their 0 293 51
very 0 293 51
own 0 293 51
gun 0 293 51
that 0 293 51
is 0 293 51
unregistered. 0 293 51

That's 0 293 52
right, 0 293 52
and 0 293 52
it's 0 293 52
perfectly 0 293 52
legal 0 293 52
to 0 293 52
do 0 293 52
so. 0 293 52

And 0 293 53
we 0 293 53
aren't 0 293 53
just 0 293 53
talking 0 293 53
a 0 293 53
rigid 0 293 53
looking 0 293 53
one-shot 0 293 53
handgun. 0 293 53

We're 0 293 54
talking 0 293 54
ARs, 0 293 54
1911s 0 293 54
and 0 293 54
a 0 293 54
host 0 293 54
of 0 293 54
other 0 293 54
guns. 0 293 54

This 0 293 55
actually 0 293 55
may 0 293 55
end 0 293 55
up 0 293 55
undermining 0 293 55
the 0 293 55
gun 0 293 55
manufacturing 0 293 55
industry 0 293 55
in 0 293 55
the 0 293 55
future, 0 293 55
as 0 293 55
people 0 293 55
will 0 293 55
be 0 293 55
able 0 293 55

their 0 293 55
own 0 293 55
guns 0 293 55
at 0 293 55
home 0 293 55
in 0 293 55
a 0 293 55
similar 0 293 55
manner 0 293 55
to 0 293 55
how 0 293 55
the 0 293 55
internet 0 293 55
has 0 293 55
had 0 293 55
a 0 293 55
dramatic 0 293 55
effect 0 293 55
on 0 293 55
the 0 293 55

Wilson 0 293 56
boasted 1 293 56
that 0 293 56
his 1 293 56

have 1 293 56
officially 1 293 56
killed 1 293 56
gun 1 293 56
control. 1 293 56

"I 0 293 57
barely 1 293 57
put 1 293 57

into 1 293 57

got 1 293 57
you 1 293 57
the 1 293 57
Second 1 293 57
Amendment 1 293 57
forever," 1 293 57
he 0 293 57
told 0 293 57
The 0 293 57
Daily 0 293 57
Wire 0 293 57
in 0 293 57
a 0 293 57
phone 0 293 57
interview. 0 293 57

"What 1 293 58
has 1 293 58
the 1 293 58
NRA 1 293 58
done 1 293 58
for 1 293 58
you 1 293 58
lately?" 1 293 58

I 0 293 59
don't 0 293 59
know 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
I 0 293 59
would 0 293 59
go 0 293 59
quite 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
far, 0 293 59
after 0 293 59
all, 0 293 59
the 0 293 59
settlement 0 293 59
does 0 293 59
state 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
"the 0 293 59
government 0 293 59
expressly 0 293 59
acknowledges 0 293 59
that 0 293 59
non-automatic 0 293 59
firearms 0 293 59
up 0 293 59
to 0 293 59
.50-caliber 0 293 59
– 0 293 59
including 0 293 59
modern 0 293 59
semi-auto 0 293 59
sporting 0 293 59
rifles 0 293 59
such 0 293 59
as 0 293 59
the 0 293 59
popular 0 293 59
AR-15 0 293 59
and 0 293 59
similar 0 293 59
firearms 0 293 59
– 0 293 59
are 0 293 59
not 0 293 59
inherently 0 293 59
military." 0 293 59

Therefore, 0 293 60
the 0 293 60
government 0 293 60
still 0 293 60
believes 0 293 60
it 0 293 60
has 0 293 60
a 0 293 60
right 0 293 60
to 0 293 60
regulate 0 293 60
certain 0 293 60
arms, 0 293 60
which 0 293 60
it 0 293 60
does 0 293 60
not 0 293 60
have 0 293 60
authority 0 293 60
to 0 293 60
do. 0 293 60

"This 0 293 61
doesn’t 0 293 61
put 0 293 61
the 0 293 61
rifle 0 293 61
in 0 293 61
everyone’s 0 293 61
hand, 0 293 61
but 0 293 61
it 0 293 61
does 0 293 61
that 0 293 61
in 0 293 61
essence" 0 293 61
he 0 293 61
added. 0 293 61

"The 1 293 62
DNA 1 293 62
of 1 293 62
our 1 293 62

This 1 293 63
is 1 293 63

it 1 293 63

obvious 0 295 7
– 0 295 7
I 0 295 7
thought 0 295 7
it 0 295 7
would 0 295 7
be 0 295 7
obvious 0 295 7
– 0 295 7
but 0 295 7
I 0 295 7
would 0 295 7
like 0 295 7
to 0 295 7
clarify, 0 295 7
just 0 295 7
in 0 295 7
case 0 295 7
it 0 295 7
wasn’t. 0 295 7

In 0 295 8
a 0 295 8
key 0 295 8
sentence 0 295 8
in 0 295 8
my 0 295 8
remarks, 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
said 0 295 8
the 0 295 8
word 0 295 8
‘would’ 0 295 8
instead 0 295 8
of 0 295 8
“wouldn’t.” 0 295 8
The 0 295 8
sentence 0 295 8
should 0 295 8
have 0 295 8
been: 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
don’t 0 295 8
see 0 295 8
any 0 295 8
reason 0 295 8
why 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
wouldn’t 0 295 8
– 0 295 8
or 0 295 8
why 0 295 8
it 0 295 8
wouldn’t 0 295 8
be 0 295 8
Russia. 0 295 8

So 0 295 9
just 0 295 9
to 0 295 9
repeat 0 295 9
it, 0 295 9
I 0 295 9
said 0 295 9
the 0 295 9
word 0 295 9
‘would’ 0 295 9
instead 0 295 9
of 0 295 9
‘wouldn’t’ 0 295 9
… 0 295 9

“I 0 295 10
have, 0 295 10
on 0 295 10
numerous 0 295 10
occasions, 0 295 10
noted 0 295 10
our 0 295 10
intelligence 0 295 10
findings 0 295 10
that 0 295 10
Russians 0 295 10
attempted 0 295 10
to 0 295 10
interfere 0 295 10
in 0 295 10
our 1 295 10
elections. 0 295 10

Unlike 0 295 11
previous 0 295 11
administrations, 0 295 11
my 0 295 11
administration 0 295 11
has 0 295 11
and 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
continue 0 295 11
to 0 295 11
move 0 295 11
aggressively 1 295 11
to 0 295 11
repeal 0 295 11
any 0 295 11
efforts 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
and 0 295 11
repel 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
we 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
stop 0 295 11
it, 0 295 11
we 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
repel 0 295 11
it 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
any 0 295 11

to 0 295 11
interfere 0 295 11
in 0 295 11
our 1 295 11
elections. 0 295 11

We’re 0 295 12
doing 0 295 12
everything 0 295 12
in 0 295 12
our 1 295 12
power 0 295 12
to 0 295 12
prevent 0 295 12
Russian 0 295 12
interference 0 295 12
in 0 295 12
2018.” 0 295 12

Anyone 0 295 13
who 0 295 13
has 0 295 13
studied 0 295 13
President 0 295 13
Trump 0 295 13
knows 0 295 13
he 0 295 13
hates 0 295 13
to 0 295 13
admit 0 295 13
a 0 295 13
mistake. 0 295 13

His 0 295 14
natural 0 295 14
pattern 0 295 14
is 0 295 14
to 0 295 14
move 0 295 14
forward 0 295 14
and 0 295 14
ignore 0 295 14
mistakes. 0 295 14

For 0 295 15
him, 0 295 15
this 0 295 15
was 0 295 15
a 0 295 15
big 0 295 15
correction 0 295 15
(and 0 295 15
as 0 295 15
I 0 295 15
noted 0 295 15
the 0 295 15
day 0 295 15
before, 0 295 15
it 0 295 15
was 0 295 15
an 0 295 15
absolutely 0 295 15
necessary 0 295 15
one). 0 295 15

President 1 295 16
Trump 1 295 16
then 1 295 16
reminded 1 295 16
everyone 1 295 16
of 1 295 16
the 1 295 16
Obama 1 295 16
administration’s 1 295 16
failures 1 295 16
in 1 295 16
dealing 1 295 16
with 1 295 16
Russian 1 295 16
meddling 1 295 16
in 1 295 16
the 1 295 16
election. 1 295 16

President 0 295 17
Trump 0 295 17
noted 0 295 17
that 0 295 17
President 0 295 17
Obama 0 295 17
and 0 295 17
his 0 295 17
advisers 0 295 17
had 0 295 17
information 0 295 17
that 0 295 17
the 0 295 17
Russians 0 295 17
had 0 295 17
been 0 295 17
working 0 295 17
to 0 295 17
interfere 0 295 17
in 0 295 17
the 0 295 17
election 0 295 17
and 0 295 17
they 0 295 17
ignored 0 295 17
it, 0 295 17
because 1 295 17
they 1 295 17
thought 1 295 17
Hillary 1 295 17
Clinton 1 295 17
was 1 295 17
going 1 295 17
to 1 295 17
win. 1 295 17

President 0 295 18
Trump 0 295 18
said: 0 295 18
“President 0 295 18
Obama, 0 295 18
along 0 295 18
with 0 295 18
(then-CIA 0 295 18

Clapper 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
the 0 295 18
whole 0 295 18
group 0 295 18
that 0 295 18
you 0 295 18
see 0 295 18
on 0 295 18
television 0 295 18
now 0 295 18
– 0 295 18
probably 0 295 18
getting 0 295 18
paid 0 295 18
a 0 295 18
lot 0 295 18
of 0 295 18
money 0 295 18
by 0 295 18
your 0 295 18
networks 0 295 18
– 0 295 18
they 0 295 18
knew 0 295 18
about 0 295 18
Russia’s 0 295 18
attempt 0 295 18
to 0 295 18
interfere 0 295 18
in 0 295 18
the 0 295 18
election 0 295 18
in 0 295 18
September, 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
they 0 295 18
totally 0 295 18
buried 0 295 18
it. 0 295 18

And 0 295 19
as 0 295 19
I 0 295 19
said, 0 295 19
they 0 295 19
buried 0 295 19
it 0 295 19
because 1 295 19
they 1 295 19
thought 1 295 19
that 1 295 19

Clinton 1 295 19
was 1 295 19
going 1 295 19
to 1 295 19

It 0 295 20
turned 0 295 20
out 0 295 20
it 0 295 20
didn’t 0 295 20
happen 0 295 20
that 0 295 20
way. 0 295 20

“By 0 295 21
contrast, 0 295 21
my 0 295 21
administration 0 295 21
has 0 295 21
taken 0 295 21
a 0 295 21
very 0 295 21
firm 0 295 21
stance 0 295 21
– 0 295 21
it’s 1 295 21
a 1 295 21
very 1 295 21
firm 1 295 21
stance 1 295 21
– 0 295 21
on 0 295 21
a 0 295 21
strong 0 295 21
action. 0 295 21

We’re 0 295 22
going 0 295 22
to 0 295 22
take 0 295 22
strong 1 295 22
action 1 295 22
to 0 295 22
secure 0 295 22
our 0 295 22
election 0 295 22
systems 0 295 22
and 0 295 22
the 0 295 22
process.” 0 295 22

There 0 295 23
are 0 295 23
two 0 295 23
key 0 295 23
facts 0 295 23
in 0 295 23
this 0 295 23
statement. 0 295 23

First, 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
very 0 295 24
people 0 295 24
who 0 295 24
have 0 295 24
been 0 295 24
loudest 1 295 24
in 0 295 24
attacking 0 295 24
President 0 295 24
Trump 0 295 24
about 0 295 24
his 0 295 24
performance 0 295 24
at 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
Helsinki 0 295 24
summit 0 295 24
are 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
people 0 295 24
who 0 295 24
failed 0 295 24
to 0 295 24
protect 0 295 24
America 0 295 24
from 0 295 24
Russian 0 295 24
meddling 0 295 24
in 0 295 24
2016. 0 295 24

The 1 295 25
very 1 295 25
intensity 0 295 25
and 0 295 25
nastiness 1 295 25
of 0 295 25
former 0 295 25
CIA 0 295 25
Director 0 295 25
Brennan 0 295 25
and 0 295 25
former 0 295 25
Director 0 295 25
of 0 295 25
National 0 295 25
Intelligence 0 295 25
Clapper 0 295 25
is 0 295 25
an 0 295 25
attempt 0 295 25
to 0 295 25
distract 0 295 25
attention 0 295 25
from 0 295 25
their 0 295 25
failure 0 295 25
to 1 295 25
protect 1 295 25
America. 1 295 25

It 0 295 26
was 0 295 26
their 0 295 26
duty 0 295 26
in 0 295 26
2016 0 295 26
– 0 295 26
not 0 295 26
candidate 0 295 26
Trump’s. 0 295 26

Second, 0 295 27
the 0 295 27
Trump 0 295 27
administration 0 295 27
has 0 295 27
been 0 295 27
far 0 295 27
tougher 0 295 27
on 0 295 27
Russia 0 295 27
than 0 295 27
President 0 295 27
Obama 0 295 27
ever 0 295 27
dreamed 0 295 27
of 0 295 27
being. 0 295 27

The 1 295 28
Trump 1 295 28
administration 1 295 28
is 0 295 28
taking 0 295 28
real 0 295 28
actions 0 295 28
designed 0 295 28
to 0 295 28
weaken 0 295 28
Russia 0 295 28
and 0 295 28
force 0 295 28
Putin 0 295 28
to 0 295 28
change 0 295 28
his 0 295 28
aggressive 1 295 28
behavior. 0 295 28

The 1 295 29
Trump 1 295 29
administration 1 295 29
has 0 295 29
levied 0 295 29
tough 0 295 29
sanctions 0 295 29
on 0 295 29
Russia. 0 295 29

Also, 0 295 30
President 0 295 30
Trump’s 0 295 30
public 0 295 30
lecture 0 295 30
about 0 295 30
Germany 0 295 30
not 0 295 30
buying 0 295 30
natural 0 295 30
gas 0 295 30
from 0 295 30
Russia 0 295 30
was 0 295 30
aimed 0 295 30
at 0 295 30
cutting 0 295 30
Putin 0 295 30
off 0 295 30
from 0 295 30
hard 0 295 30
currency 0 295 30
worth 0 295 30
tens 0 295 30
of 0 295 30
billions 0 295 30
of 0 295 30
dollars 0 295 30
and 0 295 30
further 0 295 30
weakening 0 295 30
the 0 295 30
Russian 0 295 30
economy. 0 295 30

Furthermore, 0 295 31
President 0 295 31
Trump’s 0 295 31
efforts 0 295 31
to 0 295 31
get 0 295 31
our 0 295 31
European 0 295 31
allies 0 295 31
to 0 295 31
increase 0 295 31
their 0 295 31
defense 0 295 31
spending 0 295 31
has 0 295 31
a 0 295 31
direct 0 295 31
impact 0 295 31
on 0 295 31
Putin. 0 295 31

The 1 295 32
stronger 1 295 32
NATO 1 295 32
is, 1 295 32
the 1 295 32
less 1 295 32
maneuvering 1 295 32
room 1 295 32
Russia 1 295 32
has. 1 295 32

Beyond 0 295 33
pressuring 0 295 33
our 1 295 33
allies, 0 295 33
consider 0 295 33
these 0 295 33
specific 0 295 33
steps 0 295 33
President 0 295 33
Trump 0 295 33
has 0 295 33
taken 0 295 33
against 0 295 33
Russia: 0 295 33

Where 0 295 34
President 0 295 34
Obama 0 295 34
refused 0 295 34
to 0 295 34
provide 0 295 34
serious 0 295 34
weapons 0 295 34
to 0 295 34
the 0 295 34
Ukrainians 0 295 34
to 0 295 34
help 0 295 34
them 0 295 34
defend 0 295 34
themselves 0 295 34
(his 0 295 34
response 0 295 34
was 0 295 34
weakness 1 295 34
on 1 295 34
a 1 295 34
pathetic 1 295 34
scale), 1 295 34
President 0 295 34
Trump 0 295 34
has 0 295 34
approved 0 295 34
the 0 295 34
sale 0 295 34
of 0 295 34
offensive 0 295 34
weapons 0 295 34
to 0 295 34
enable 0 295 34
the 0 295 34
Ukrainians 0 295 34
to 0 295 34
increase 0 295 34
the 0 295 34
cost 0 295 34
of 0 295 34
Russian 0 295 34
aggression. 0 295 34

When 0 295 35
the 0 295 35
Russians 0 295 35
used 0 295 35
chemical 0 295 35
weapons 0 295 35
in 0 295 35
Great 0 295 35
Britain, 0 295 35
President 0 295 35
Trump 0 295 35
joined 0 295 35
our 1 295 35
allies 0 295 35
and 0 295 35
expelled 0 295 35
60 0 295 35
Russian 0 295 35
intelligence 0 295 35
officers 0 295 35
from 0 295 35
the 0 295 35
United 0 295 35
States. 0 295 35

When 0 295 36
the 0 295 36
Russians 0 295 36
retaliated, 0 295 36
the 1 295 36
Trump 1 295 36
administration 1 295 36
closed 0 295 36
the 0 295 36
Russian 0 295 36
consulate 0 295 36
in 0 295 36
Seattle. 0 295 36

President 0 295 37
Trump 0 295 37
had 0 295 37
previously 0 295 37
shuttered 0 295 37
the 0 295 37
Russian 0 295 37
consulate 0 295 37
in 0 295 37
San 0 295 37
Francisco 0 295 37
and 0 295 37
smaller 0 295 37
annexes 0 295 37
in 0 295 37
Washington 0 295 37
and 0 295 37
New 0 295 37
York. 0 295 37

More 0 295 38
than 0 295 38
100 0 295 38
Russian 0 295 38
individuals 0 295 38
and 0 295 38
companies 0 295 38
have 0 295 38
been 0 295 38
sanctioned 0 295 38
for 0 295 38
a 0 295 38
variety 0 295 38
of 0 295 38
reasons. 0 295 38

Despite 0 295 39
the 0 295 39
hysteria 0 295 39
of 0 295 39
the 0 295 39
left, 0 295 39
it 0 295 39
is 0 295 39

anything 0 295 39

in 0 295 39

Nothing 0 295 40

Finally, 0 295 41
a 0 295 41

about 0 295 41

We 0 295 42
are 0 295 42
in 0 295 42
the 0 295 42
early 0 295 42
stages 0 295 42
of 0 295 42
a 0 295 42
cultural 0 295 42

war 0 295 42
in 0 295 42
which 0 295 42
the 0 295 42

sees 0 295 42
itself 0 295 42
losing. 0 295 42

This 0 295 43
is 0 295 43
what 0 295 43

With 0 295 44
President 0 295 44
Trump’s 0 295 44
nomination 0 295 44
of 0 295 44
Judge 0 295 44
Brett 0 295 44
Kavanaugh 0 295 44
to 0 295 44
the 0 295 44
Supreme 0 295 44
Court, 0 295 44
it 0 295 44
was 0 295 44
clear 0 295 44
that 0 295 44
anyone 0 295 44
Trump 0 295 44
nominated 0 295 44
was 0 295 44
going 0 295 44
to 0 295 44
be 0 295 44
attacked. 0 295 44

In 0 295 45
fact, 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
demonstrators 0 295 45
protesting 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
nomination 0 295 45
had 0 295 45
signs 0 295 45
for 0 295 45
all 0 295 45
four 0 295 45
of 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
finalists 0 295 45
and 0 295 45
were 0 295 45
instantly 0 295 45
ready 0 295 45
to 0 295 45
oppose 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
president 0 295 45
regardless 0 295 45
of 0 295 45
his 0 295 45
choice. 0 295 45

Similarly, 0 295 46
Obama-era 0 295 46
national 0 295 46
security 0 295 46
officials 0 295 46
seem 0 295 46
determined 0 295 46
to 0 295 46
use 0 295 46
the 0 295 46
harshest 1 295 46
possible 1 295 46
language 0 295 46
to 0 295 46
attack 0 295 46
President 0 295 46
Trump. 0 295 46

I 0 295 47
think 0 295 47
their 0 295 47
strong 0 295 47
words 0 295 47
and 0 295 47
hysteria 1 295 47
are 0 295 47
driven 1 295 47
by 1 295 47
their 1 295 47
own 1 295 47
guilt. 1 295 47

Whatever 0 295 48
the 0 295 48
Russians 0 295 48
did, 0 295 48
they 0 295 48
did 0 295 48
while 0 295 48
Brennan 0 295 48
was 0 295 48
director 0 295 48
of 0 295 48

Clapper 0 295 48
was 0 295 48

national 0 295 48

and 0 295 48
James 0 295 48
Comey 0 295 48
was 0 295 48
head 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
the 0 295 48
Federal 0 295 48
Bureau 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
Investigation. 0 295 48

These 0 295 49
former 0 295 49
officials 0 295 49
attack 0 295 49
Trump 0 295 49
ferociously 1 295 49
to 0 295 49
hide 0 295 49
their 0 295 49
own 0 295 49
failure 0 295 49
and 0 295 49
their 0 295 49
own 0 295 49
guilt. 0 295 49

Just 0 295 50
keep 0 295 50
that 0 295 50
in 0 295 50
mind 0 295 50
the 0 295 50
next 0 295 50

My 0 295 50

is 0 295 50

that 0 295 50

President 0 295 50

and 0 295 50

the 0 295 50

of 1 296 12

We 0 296 13
are 0 296 13
currently 0 296 13
experiencing 0 296 13
sedition 0 296 13
at 0 296 13
the 0 296 13
highest 0 296 13

In 1 296 14
1961 1 296 14
President 1 296 14
Dwight 1 296 14
Eisenhower 1 296 14
warned 1 296 14
Americans 1 296 14
in 1 296 14
his 1 296 14
last 1 296 14
public 1 296 14
address 1 296 14
that 1 296 14
the 1 296 14
military/industrial 1 296 14
complex 1 296 14
was 1 296 14
a 1 296 14
threat 1 296 14
to 1 296 14
American 1 296 14
democracy. 1 296 14

Truer 0 296 15

spoken 0 296 15

Shortly 0 296 16
thereafter, 0 296 16
the 0 296 16

assassinated 0 296 16

To 0 296 17
get 0 296 17
rid 0 296 17
of 0 296 17

Nixon, 0 296 17

that 0 296 17
the 0 296 17

the 0 296 19

a 0 334 15
case 0 334 15
the 0 334 15

the 0 334 18

was 0 335 2
about 0 335 2

Faggioli’s 0 335 3
propaganda 0 335 3

now 0 335 3
becomes 0 335 3
merely 0 335 3

here 0 335 3
in 0 335 3

of 0 335 3
this 0 335 3
astonishing 1 335 3
and 1 335 3
indeed 1 335 3
providential 1 335 3
development. 1 335 3

Regarding 0 335 4
Bergoglio, 0 335 4
Viganò 0 335 4
testifies 0 335 4
that 0 335 4
in 0 335 4
2013 0 335 4
he 0 335 4
personally 0 335 4
informed 0 335 4
him 0 335 4
about 0 335 4
McCarrick’s 0 335 4
history, 0 335 4
the 0 335 4
dossier 0 335 4
of 0 335 4
the 0 335 4
Congregation 0 335 4
for 0 335 4
Bishops 0 335 4
on 0 335 4
his 0 335 4
sexual 0 335 4
crimes 0 335 4
against 0 335 4
boys 0 335 4
and 0 335 4
young 0 335 4
men, 0 335 4
and 0 335 4
the 0 335 4
disciplinary 0 335 4
sanctions 0 335 4
imposed 0 335 4
upon 0 335 4
him 0 335 4
by 0 335 4
Benedict 0 335 4
XVI 0 335 4
(forbidding 0 335 4
residence 0 335 4
in 0 335 4
a 0 335 4
seminary, 0 335 4
public 0 335 4
appearances 0 335 4
and 0 335 4
Masses). 0 335 4

Evidently 0 335 5
already 0 335 5
aware 0 335 5
of 0 335 5
these 0 335 5
facts, 0 335 5
however, 0 335 5
Bergoglio 0 335 5
not 0 335 5
only 0 335 5
rehabilitated 0 335 5
McCarrick 0 335 5
but 0 335 5
made 0 335 5
him 0 335 5
a 0 335 5
“trusted 0 335 5
counselor” 0 335 5
who 0 335 5
advised 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
elevation 0 335 5
of 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
pro-homosexual 0 335 5
prelates 0 335 5
Blase 0 335 5
Cupich, 0 335 5
Joseph 0 335 5
Tobin 0 335 5
and 0 335 5
Kevin 0 335 5
Farrell 0 335 5
to 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
College 0 335 5
of 0 335 5
Cardinals 0 335 5
and 0 335 5
the 0 335 5
prominent 0 335 5
episcopal 0 335 5
sees 0 335 5
they 0 335 5
now 0 335 5
discredit. 0 335 5

All 0 335 6
of 0 335 6
this 0 335 6
happened 0 335 6
before 0 335 6
Bergoglio, 0 335 6
bowing 0 335 6
to 0 335 6
worldwide 0 335 6
public 0 335 6
pressure, 0 335 6
finally—only 0 335 6
weeks 0 335 6
ago—took 0 335 6
decisive 0 335 6
action 0 335 6
against 0 335 6
his 0 335 6
“trusted 1 335 6
counselor.” 1 335 6
McCarrick 0 335 6
had 0 335 6
lobbied 0 335 6
for 0 335 6
Bergoglio’s 0 335 6
election, 0 335 6
along 0 335 6
with 0 335 6
Maradiaga 0 335 6
and 0 335 6
the 1 335 6
infamous 1 335 6
Cardinal 1 335 6
Danneels, 0 335 6
who 1 335 6
covered 1 335 6
up 1 335 6
homosexual 1 335 6
rape 1 335 6
committed 1 335 6
by 1 335 6
a 1 335 6
priest 1 335 6
against 1 335 6
his 1 335 6
own 1 335 6
nephew,has 1 335 6
supported 1 335 6
“same-sex 1 335 6
marriage,” 1 335 6
and 1 335 6
advised 1 335 6
the 1 335 6
King 1 335 6
of 1 335 6
Belgium 1 335 6
to 1 335 6
sign 1 335 6
a 1 335 6
law 1 335 6
legalizing 1 335 6
abortion 1 335 6
in 1 335 6
1990. 1 335 6

As 1 335 7
Edward 1 335 7
Pentin 1 335 7
notes: 1 335 7
“all 1 335 7
3 1 335 7
prelates 1 335 7
have 1 335 7
since 1 335 7
been 1 335 7
special 1 335 7
advisors 1 335 7
of 1 335 7
Francis 1 335 7
or 1 335 7
rehabilitated 1 335 7
by 1 335 7
him.” 1 335 7

Viganò 0 335 8
concludes 0 335 8
his 0 335 8
testimony 0 335 8
by 0 335 8
declaring 0 335 8
that 0 335 8
all 0 335 8
of 0 335 8
the 0 335 8
prelates 0 335 8
involved 0 335 8
(many 0 335 8
others 0 335 8
are 0 335 8
implicated), 0 335 8
including 0 335 8
Bergoglio, 0 335 8
should 0 335 8
resign 0 335 8
their 0 335 8
offices 0 335 8
for 0 335 8
the 0 335 8
good 0 335 8
of 0 335 8
the 0 335 8
Church. 0 335 8

As 0 335 9
to 0 335 9
Bergoglio 0 335 9
in 0 335 9
particular, 0 335 9
he 0 335 9
courageously 0 335 9
states 0 335 9
openly 0 335 9
the 0 335 9
truth 0 335 9
that 0 335 9
so 0 335 9
many 0 335 9
of 0 335 9
his 0 335 9
brethren 0 335 9
know 0 335 9
but 0 335 9
fear 0 335 9
to 0 335 9
speak 0 335 9
in 0 335 9
public: 0 335 9

I 0 335 10
want 0 335 10
to 0 335 10
recall 0 335 10
this 1 335 10
indefectible 1 335 10
truth 1 335 10
of 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
Church’s 0 335 10
holiness 0 335 10
to 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
many 0 335 10
people 0 335 10
who 0 335 10
have 0 335 10
been 0 335 10
so 0 335 10
deeply 1 335 10
scandalized 1 335 10
by 1 335 10
the 1 335 10
abominable 1 335 10
and 1 335 10
sacrilegious 1 335 10
behavior 1 335 10
of 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
former 0 335 10
Archbishop 0 335 10
of 0 335 10
Washington, 0 335 10
Theodore 0 335 10
McCarrick; 0 335 10
by 0 335 10
the 1 335 10
grave, 1 335 10
disconcerting 1 335 10
and 1 335 10
sinful 1 335 10
conduct 1 335 10
of 0 335 10
Pope 0 335 10
Francis 0 335 10
and 0 335 10
by 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
conspiracy 0 335 10
of 0 335 10
silence 0 335 10
of 0 335 10
so 0 335 10
many 0 335 10
pastors, 0 335 10
and 0 335 10
who 0 335 10
are 0 335 10
tempted 0 335 10
to 0 335 10
abandon 0 335 10
the 0 335 10
Church, 0 335 10
disfigured 1 335 10
by 1 335 10
so 1 335 10
many 1 335 10
ignominies. 1 335 10

At 0 335 11
the 0 335 11
Angelus 0 335 11
on 0 335 11
Sunday, 0 335 11
August 0 335 11
12, 0 335 11
2018 0 335 11
Pope 0 335 11
Francis 0 335 11
said 0 335 11
these 0 335 11
words: 0 335 11
“Everyone 1 335 11
is 1 335 11
guilty 1 335 11
for 1 335 11
the 1 335 11
good 1 335 11
he 1 335 11
could 1 335 11
have 1 335 11
done 1 335 11
and 1 335 11
did 1 335 11
not 1 335 11
do 1 335 11
... 1 335 11

If 1 335 12
we 1 335 12
do 1 335 12
not 1 335 12
oppose 1 335 12
evil, 1 335 12
we 1 335 12
tacitly 1 335 12
feed 1 335 12
it. 1 335 12

We 0 335 13
need 0 335 13
to 0 335 13
intervene 0 335 13
where 0 335 13
evil 0 335 13
is 0 335 13
spreading; 0 335 13
for 0 335 13
evil 0 335 13
spreads 0 335 13
where 0 335 13
daring 0 335 13
Christians 0 335 13
who 0 335 13
oppose 0 335 13
evil 0 335 13
with 0 335 13
good 0 335 13
are 0 335 13
lacking.” 0 335 13
[emphasis 0 335 13
in 0 335 13
original] 0 335 13
If 0 335 13
this 0 335 13
is 0 335 13
rightly 0 335 13
to 0 335 13
be 0 335 13
considered 0 335 13
a 0 335 13
serious 0 335 13
moral 0 335 13
responsibility 0 335 13
for 0 335 13
every 0 335 13
believer, 0 335 13
how 0 335 13
much 0 335 13
graver 0 335 13
is 0 335 13
it 0 335 13
for 0 335 13
the 1 335 13
Church’s 1 335 13
supreme 1 335 13
pastor, 1 335 13
who 1 335 13
in 1 335 13
the 1 335 13
case 1 335 13
of 1 335 13
McCarrick 1 335 13
not 1 335 13
only 1 335 13
did 1 335 13
not 1 335 13
oppose 1 335 13
evil 1 335 13
but 1 335 13
associated 1 335 13
himself 1 335 13
in 1 335 13
doing 1 335 13
evil 1 335 13
with 1 335 13
someone 1 335 13
he 1 335 13
knew 1 335 13
to 1 335 13
be 1 335 13
deeply 1 335 13
corrupt. 1 335 13

He 0 335 14
followed 0 335 14
the 0 335 14
advice 0 335 14
of 0 335 14
someone 1 335 14
he 1 335 14
knew 1 335 14
well 1 335 14
to 1 335 14
be 1 335 14
a 1 335 14
pervert, 1 335 14
thus 0 335 14

exponentially 0 335 14
with 0 335 14
his 0 335 14

evil 0 335 14
done 0 335 14

McCarrick. 0 335 14

And 0 335 15
how 0 335 15
many 0 335 15
other 0 335 15
evil 1 335 15
pastors 1 335 15

their 1 335 15
active 1 335 15
destruction 1 335 15
of 1 335 15
the 1 335 15
Church! 1 335 15

[my 0 335 16
emphasis] 0 335 16
Francis 0 335 16
is 0 335 16
abdicating 0 335 16
the 0 335 16
mandate 0 335 16
which 0 335 16
Christ 0 335 16
gave 0 335 16
to 0 335 16
Peter 0 335 16
to 0 335 16
confirm 0 335 16
the 0 335 16
brethren. 0 335 16

Indeed, 0 335 17
by 0 335 17
his 0 335 17
action 0 335 17
he 0 335 17
has 0 335 17
divided 0 335 17
them, 0 335 17
led 0 335 17
them 0 335 17
into 0 335 17
error, 0 335 17
and 0 335 17
encouraged 1 335 17
the 1 335 17
wolves 1 335 17
to 1 335 17
continue 1 335 17
to 1 335 17
tear 1 335 17
apart 1 335 17
the 1 335 17
sheep 1 335 17

dramatic 1 335 18
moment 1 335 18
for 0 335 18
the 0 335 18

he 0 335 18
must 0 335 18

of 0 335 18
zero 0 335 18

With 0 335 22
Viganò’s 0 335 22

again. 1 335 22

Even 0 335 23
before 0 335 23
that 0 335 23
testimony, 0 335 23
however, 0 335 23
the 0 335 23
fall 0 335 23
of 0 335 23
McCarrick 0 335 23
and 0 335 23
the 0 335 23
Pennsylvania 0 335 23

jury 0 335 23

already 0 335 23
presented 0 335 23
a 1 335 23
Sisyphean 1 335 23
task 1 335 23
to 0 335 23
neo-Catholic 1 335 23

decrepit 0 335 23

that 0 335 23
launched 0 335 23

Yet 1 335 24
there 1 335 24
is 1 335 24
little 1 335 24
doubt 1 335 24
they 1 335 24
will 1 335 24
continue 1 335 24
the 1 335 24
same 1 335 24
polemic 1 335 24
that 1 335 24
for 1 335 24
nearly 1 335 24
sixty 1 335 24
years 1 335 24
has 1 335 24
doggedly 1 335 24
defended 1 335 24
every 1 335 24
one 1 335 24
of 1 335 24
the 1 335 24
ruinous 1 335 24
“reforms” 1 335 24
that 1 335 24
have 1 335 24
resulted 1 335 24
in 1 335 24
a 1 335 24
debacle 1 335 24
without 1 335 24
equal 1 335 24
in 1 335 24
Church 1 335 24
history, 1 335 24
even 0 335 24
considering 0 335 24
the 0 335 24
Arian 0 335 24
crisis 0 335 24
of 0 335 24
the 0 335 24
4th 0 335 24
century. 0 335 24

Those 0 335 25
“reforms” 0 335 25
included 0 335 25
abandonment 0 335 25
of 0 335 25
the 0 335 25
Vatican’s 0 335 25
strict 0 335 25
pre-conciliar 0 335 25
instruction 0 335 25
(1961) 0 335 25
that 0 335 25
“advancement 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
religious 1 335 25
vows 1 335 25
and 1 335 25
ordination 1 335 25
should 1 335 25
be 1 335 25
barred 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
those 1 335 25
who 1 335 25
are 1 335 25
afflicted 1 335 25
with 1 335 25
evil 1 335 25
tendencies 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
homosexuality 1 335 25
or 1 335 25
pederasty, 1 335 25
since 1 335 25
for 1 335 25
them 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
common 1 335 25
life 1 335 25
and 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
priestly 1 335 25
ministry 1 335 25
would 1 335 25
constitute 1 335 25
serious 1 335 25
dangers.” 1 335 25
Today, 1 335 25
neo-Catholic 1 335 25
commentators, 1 335 25
cowed 1 335 25
by 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
demands 1 335 25
of 1 335 25
political 1 335 25
correctness, 1 335 25
refuse 1 335 25
to 1 335 25
state 1 335 25
the 1 335 25
simple 1 335 25
truth 1 335 25
that 1 335 25
homosexuality 1 335 25
is 1 335 25
a 1 335 25
perversion 1 335 25
that 1 335 25
precludes 1 335 25
ordination 1 335 25
as 1 335 25
does 1 335 25
any 1 335 25
other 1 335 25
grave 1 335 25
psychological 1 335 25
disorder. 1 335 25

either 0 335 28

His 0 335 34

“Take 1 335 34

McCarrick 0 335 52

before 0 335 52
Bergoglio’s 0 335 52
election. 0 335 52

The 0 335 53
Herald 0 335 53
asks 0 335 53
the 0 335 53
obvious 0 335 53
question: 0 335 53
“[I]f 1 335 53
Cardinal 1 335 53
Wuerl 1 335 53
was 1 335 53
unaware 1 335 53
of 1 335 53
the 1 335 53
sanctions, 1 335 53
and 1 335 53
unaware 1 335 53
of 1 335 53
the 1 335 53
reason 1 335 53
for 1 335 53
them, 1 335 53
why 1 335 53
did 1 335 53
he 1 335 53
ask 1 335 53
no 1 335 53
questions 1 335 53
of 1 335 53

the 1 335 53
reason 1 335 53
for 1 335 53
his 1 335 53
demand?” 1 335 53
The 0 335 53
question 0 335 53
answers 0 335 53
itself, 0 335 53
and 0 335 53
Viganò’s 0 335 53
testimony 0 335 53
on 0 335 53
this 0 335 53
critical 0 335 53
point 0 335 53
stands 0 335 53
confirmed 0 335 53
by 0 335 53
Wuerl’s 0 335 53

spokesman. 0 335 53

Bergoglio 0 335 54
Pleads 0 335 54
the 0 335 54
Fifth 0 335 54

Bergoglio 0 335 55
himself, 0 335 55
however, 0 335 55
has 0 335 55
already 0 335 55
precluded 0 335 55
any 0 335 55
attempt 0 335 55
to 0 335 55
impeach 0 335 55
Viganò’s 0 335 55
testimony. 0 335 55

During 0 335 56
the 0 335 56
return 0 335 56
flight 0 335 56
from 0 335 56
Dublin 0 335 56
after 0 335 56
the 0 335 56
“World 0 335 56
Meeting 0 335 56
of 0 335 56
Familes,” 0 335 56
he 0 335 56
was 0 335 56
asked 0 335 56
to 0 335 56
comment 0 335 56
on 0 335 56
Viganò 0 335 56
’s 0 335 56
allegations 0 335 56
that 0 335 56
he 0 335 56
had 0 335 56
informed 0 335 56
Bergoglio 0 335 56
of 0 335 56
McCarrick’s 0 335 56
crimes 0 335 56
in 0 335 56
2013 0 335 56
as 0 335 56
well 0 335 56
as 0 335 56
the 0 335 56
sanctions 0 335 56
imposed 0 335 56
by 0 335 56
Benedict. 0 335 56

Bergoglio 0 335 57
declined 0 335 57
to 0 335 57
incriminate 0 335 57
himself: 0 335 57

Read 0 335 58
the 0 335 58
statement 0 335 58
carefully 0 335 58
yourselves 0 335 58
and 0 335 58
make 0 335 58
your 0 335 58
own 0 335 58
judgment. 0 335 58

I 0 335 59
am 0 335 59
not 0 335 59
going 0 335 59
to 0 335 59
say 0 335 59
a 0 335 59
word 0 335 59
about 0 335 59
this. 0 335 59

I 0 335 60
believe 0 335 60
that 0 335 60
the 0 335 60
statement 0 335 60
speaks 0 335 60
for 0 335 60
itself, 0 335 60
and 0 335 60
you 0 335 60
all 0 335 60
have 0 335 60
sufficient 0 335 60
journalistic 0 335 60
ability 0 335 60
to 0 335 60
draw 0 335 60
conclusions. 0 335 60

It 0 335 61
is 0 335 61
an 0 335 61
act 0 335 61
of 0 335 61
trust. 0 335 61

When 0 335 62
a 0 335 62
little 0 335 62
time 0 335 62
goes 0 335 62
by, 0 335 62
and 0 335 62
you 0 335 62
have 0 335 62
drawn 0 335 62
conclusions, 0 335 62
perhaps 0 335 62
I 0 335 62
will 0 335 62
speak 0 335 62
about 0 335 62
it, 0 335 62
but 0 335 62
I 0 335 62
would 0 335 62
like 0 335 62
your 0 335 62
professional 0 335 62
maturity 0 335 62
to 0 335 62
do 0 335 62
this 0 335 62
work. 0 335 62

It 0 335 63
will 0 335 63
do 0 335 63
you 0 335 63
all 0 335 63
good, 0 335 63
really. 0 335 63

In 0 335 64
other 0 335 64
words, 0 335 64
as 1 335 64
Bergoglio 1 335 64
cannot 1 335 64
deny 1 335 64
the 1 335 64
allegations 1 335 64
without 1 335 64
lying, 1 335 64
he 1 335 64
will 1 335 64
say 1 335 64
nothing 1 335 64
at 1 335 64
all 1 335 64
about 1 335 64
them 1 335 64
in 1 335 64
the 1 335 64
hope 1 335 64
they 1 335 64
will 1 335 64
go 1 335 64
away—with 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
help 0 335 64
of 0 335 64
sycophants 1 335 64
in 1 335 64
the 1 335 64
Vatican 1 335 64
press 1 335 64
corps 1 335 64
and 1 335 64
shifty 1 335 64
polemicists 1 335 64
like 0 335 64
Shea, 0 335 64
who 0 335 64
expects 1 335 64
his 1 335 64
readers 1 335 64
to 1 335 64
swallow 1 335 64
his 1 335 64
explanation 1 335 64
that 0 335 64
Bergoglio’s 0 335 64
refusal 0 335 64
to 0 335 64
say 0 335 64
anything 0 335 64
in 0 335 64
his 0 335 64
defense 0 335 64
when 0 335 64
asked 0 335 64
point 0 335 64
blank 0 335 64
about 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
charges 0 335 64
against 0 335 64
him 0 335 64
“seems 0 335 64
to 0 335 64
me 0 335 64
to 0 335 64
obviously 0 335 64
be 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
reply 0 335 64
of 0 335 64
somebody 0 335 64
who 0 335 64
believes 0 335 64
the 0 335 64
accusations 0 335 64
are 0 335 64
groundless…”. 0 335 64

Seems 0 335 65
to 0 335 65
be. 0 335 65

Obviously. 0 335 66

While 0 335 68
events 0 335 68
have 0 335 68
overtaken 0 335 68
Faggioli’s 0 335 68
piece, 0 335 68
it 0 335 68
will 0 335 68
remain 0 335 68
useful 0 335 68
here 0 335 68
as 0 335 68
a 0 335 68
prime 0 335 68
example 0 335 68
of 0 335 68
the 0 335 68
neo-Catholic 0 335 68
polemic. 0 335 68

That 0 335 69
polemic 0 335 69
seeks 0 335 69
to 0 335 69
shore 0 335 69
up 0 335 69
the 0 335 69
collapsing 0 335 69
Novus 0 335 69
Ordo 0 335 69
establishment 0 335 69
lest 0 335 69
it 0 335 69
give 0 335 69
way 0 335 69
to 0 335 69
the 1 335 69
dreaded 1 335 69
traditionalist 1 335 69
revival. 1 335 69

But 0 335 70
before 0 335 70
I 0 335 70
address 0 335 70
Faggioli’s 0 335 70
latest 0 335 70
defense 0 335 70
of 0 335 70
the 0 335 70
indefensible, 0 335 70
some 0 335 70
background 0 335 70
is 0 335 70
in 0 335 70
order, 0 335 70
including 0 335 70
a 0 335 70
discussion 0 335 70
of 0 335 70
further 0 335 70
key 0 335 70
details 0 335 70
of 0 335 70
Viganò’s 0 335 70
testimony. 0 335 70

First 0 335 71
of 0 335 71
all, 0 335 71
as 0 335 71
I 0 335 71
predicted 0 335 71
16 0 335 71
years 0 335 71
ago, 0 335 71
because 0 335 71
the 0 335 71
Vatican 0 335 71
under 0 335 71
John 0 335 71
Paul 0 335 71
II 0 335 71
had 0 335 71
no 0 335 71
intention 0 335 71
of 0 335 71
enforcing 0 335 71
the 0 335 71
pre-conciliar 0 335 71
ban 0 335 71
on 0 335 71
admission 0 335 71
of 0 335 71
homosexuals 0 335 71
to 0 335 71
the 0 335 71
seminary 0 335 71
“a 0 335 71
new 1 335 71
bumper 1 335 71
crop 1 335 71
of 1 335 71
homosexual 1 335 71
ordinands 1 335 71
is 0 335 71
guaranteed—and 0 335 71
with 0 335 71
it 0 335 71
a 1 335 71
new 1 335 71
harvest 1 335 71
of 1 335 71
scandal 1 335 71
for 1 335 71
the 1 335 71
Church.” 1 335 71
That 0 335 71
prediction 0 335 71
came 0 335 71
immediately 0 335 71
after 0 335 71
the 1 335 71
“pedophile 1 335 71
summit” 1 335 71
of 1 335 71
2002 1 335 71
in 1 335 71
Rome, 1 335 71
which 0 335 71
I 0 335 71
attended 0 335 71
as 0 335 71
The 0 335 71
Remnant’s 0 335 71
correspondent. 0 335 71

In 0 335 72
answer 0 335 72
to 0 335 72
my 0 335 72
question 0 335 72
then 0 335 72
head 0 335 72
of 0 335 72
the 0 335 72
USCCB, 0 335 72
Wilton 0 335 72
Gregory, 0 335 72
made 0 335 72
an 1 335 72
explosive 1 335 72
admission 1 335 72
reportedby 0 335 72
the 0 335 72
international 0 335 72
press: 0 335 72
“it 0 335 72
is 0 335 72
an 0 335 72
ongoing 0 335 72
struggle 0 335 72
to 0 335 72
make 0 335 72
sure 0 335 72
that 0 335 72
the 0 335 72
Catholic 0 335 72
priesthood 0 335 72
is 0 335 72
not 0 335 72
dominated 0 335 72
by 0 335 72
homosexual 0 335 72
men.” 0 335 72
The 1 335 72
struggle, 1 335 72
to 1 335 72
the 1 335 72
extent 1 335 72
there 1 335 72
even 1 335 72
was 1 335 72
one, 1 335 72
obviously 1 335 72
has 1 335 72
been 1 335 72
lost. 1 335 72

Sixteen 0 335 73
years 0 335 73
later, 0 335 73
the 1 335 73
homosexual 1 335 73
predator 1 335 73
McCarrick 0 335 73
has 0 335 73
finally 0 335 73
been 0 335 73
exposed 0 335 73
to 0 335 73
the 0 335 73
world, 0 335 73
stripped 0 335 73
of 0 335 73
his 0 335 73
cardinal’s 0 335 73
hat 0 335 73
and 0 335 73
deprived 0 335 73
of 0 335 73
any 0 335 73
ministry, 0 335 73
but 0 335 73
only 0 335 73
after 0 335 73
international 0 335 73
media 0 335 73
coverage 0 335 73
of 0 335 73
the 0 335 73
Vatican’s 0 335 73
semi-secret 0 335 73
finding 0 335 73
that 0 335 73
McCarrick 0 335 73
had 0 335 73
raped 0 335 73
a 0 335 73
teenage 0 335 73
altar 0 335 73
boy 0 335 73
47 0 335 73
years 0 335 73
ago. 0 335 73

If 0 335 74
not 0 335 74
for 0 335 74
that 0 335 74
one 0 335 74
case, 0 335 74
McCarrick’s 0 335 74
sixty 0 335 74
years 0 335 74
of 0 335 74
homosexual 1 335 74
debauchery 1 335 74
might 0 335 74
well 0 335 74
have 0 335 74
gone 0 335 74
unpunished 0 335 74
in 0 335 74
this 0 335 74
world 0 335 74
and 0 335 74
he 0 335 74
would 0 335 74
have 0 335 74
died 0 335 74
still 0 335 74
possessed 0 335 74
of 0 335 74
all 0 335 74
the 0 335 74
phony 1 335 74
honors 1 335 74
that 0 335 74
had 0 335 74
been 0 335 74
heaped 0 335 74
upon 0 335 74
him 0 335 74
throughout 0 335 74
his 0 335 74
career 0 335 74
as 0 335 74
a 1 335 74
parasite 1 335 74
in 1 335 74
the 1 335 74
Body 1 335 74
of 1 335 74
Christ, 1 335 74
including 0 335 74
the 0 335 74
favor 0 335 74
shown 0 335 74
to 0 335 74
him 0 335 74
by 0 335 74
Bergoglio. 0 335 74

The 0 335 75
telling 0 335 75
details 0 335 75
of 0 335 75
Archbishop 0 335 75
Viganò’s 0 335 75
testimony 0 335 75
concerning 0 335 75
Bergoglio’s 0 335 75
friendly 0 335 75
relations 0 335 75
with 0 335 75
McCarrick 0 335 75
before 0 335 75
he 0 335 75
finally 0 335 75
had 0 335 75
to 0 335 75
cut 0 335 75
him 0 335 75
loose—details 1 335 75
conveniently 1 335 75
ignored 1 335 75
by 1 335 75
Winters, 1 335 75
Allen 1 335 75
and 1 335 75
Shea—are 1 335 75
utterly 1 335 75
devastating 1 335 75
to 0 335 75
any 0 335 75
defense 0 335 75
of 0 335 75
Bergoglio. 0 335 75

This 0 335 76
would 0 335 76
explain 0 335 76
why 0 335 76
he 0 335 76
will 0 335 76
not 0 335 76
a 0 335 76
“say 0 335 76
a 0 335 76
word 0 335 76
about” 0 335 76
Viganò’s 0 335 76
charges 0 335 76
against 0 335 76
him. 0 335 76

The 0 335 77
Archbishop 0 335 77
reveals, 0 335 77
as 0 335 77
already 0 335 77
noted, 0 335 77
that 0 335 77
Pope 0 335 77
Benedict 0 335 77
imposed 0 335 77
sanctions 0 335 77
on 0 335 77
McCarrick 0 335 77
under 0 335 77
which 0 335 77
he 0 335 77
“was 0 335 77
to 0 335 77

the 0 335 77

he 0 335 77
was 0 335 77

in 0 335 77
public 0 335 77
meetings, 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
give 0 335 77
lectures, 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
travel, 0 335 77
with 0 335 77
the 0 335 77
obligation 0 335 77
of 0 335 77
dedicating 0 335 77
himself 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
a 0 335 77
life 0 335 77
of 0 335 77
prayer 0 335 77
and 0 335 77
penance.” 0 335 77
Viganò 0 335 77
further 0 335 77
reveals 0 335 77
that 0 335 77
those 0 335 77
sanctions 0 335 77
were 0 335 77
communicated 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
McCarrick 0 335 77
by 0 335 77
then 0 335 77
Apostolic 0 335 77
Nuncio 0 335 77
to 0 335 77
the 0 335 77
United 0 335 77
States, 0 335 77
Pietro 0 335 77
Sambi, 0 335 77
but 0 335 77
were 0 335 77
also 0 335 77
repeated 0 335 77
by 0 335 77
Viganò 0 335 77
himself 0 335 77
when 0 335 77
he 0 335 77
succeeded 0 335 77
Sambi 0 335 77
as 0 335 77
Nuncio: 0 335 77

I 0 335 78
repeated 0 335 78
them 0 335 78
to 0 335 78
Cardinal 0 335 78
McCarrick 0 335 78
at 0 335 78
my 0 335 78
first 0 335 78
meeting 0 335 78
with 0 335 78
him 0 335 78
at 0 335 78
the 0 335 78
Nunciature. 0 335 78

The 0 335 79
Cardinal, 0 335 79
muttering 1 335 79
in 1 335 79
a 1 335 79
barely 1 335 79
comprehensible 1 335 79
way, 1 335 79
admitted 0 335 79
that 0 335 79
he 0 335 79
had 0 335 79
perhaps 1 335 79
made 1 335 79
the 1 335 79
mistake 1 335 79
of 1 335 79
sleeping 1 335 79
in 1 335 79
the 1 335 79
same 1 335 79
bed 1 335 79
with 1 335 79
some 1 335 79
seminarians 1 335 79
at 1 335 79
his 1 335 79
beach 1 335 79
house, 1 335 79
but 0 335 79
he 0 335 79
said 0 335 79
this 0 335 79
as 0 335 79
if 0 335 79
it 0 335 79
had 0 335 79
no 0 335 79
importance. 0 335 79

Viganò 0 335 80
testifies 0 335 80
that 0 335 80
on 0 335 80
June 0 335 80
23, 0 335 80
2013, 0 335 80
he 0 335 80
obtained 0 335 80
a 0 335 80
private 0 335 80
audience 0 335 80
with 0 335 80
Bergoglio 0 335 80
after 0 335 80
having 0 335 80
encountered 0 335 80
McCarrick 0 335 80
at 0 335 80
the 0 335 80
Pope’s 0 335 80
residence 0 335 80
three 0 335 80
days 0 335 80
earlier, 0 335 80
during 0 335 80
which 0 335 80
encounter 0 335 80
McCarrick 0 335 80
had 0 335 80
told 0 335 80
him 0 335 80
with 0 335 80
an 0 335 80
air 0 335 80
of 0 335 80
triumph: 0 335 80
“The 0 335 80
Pope 0 335 80
received 0 335 80
me 0 335 80
yesterday, 0 335 80
tomorrow 0 335 80
I 0 335 80
am 0 335 80
going 0 335 80
to 0 335 80
China” 0 335 80
(evidently 0 335 80
to 0 335 80
assist 0 335 80
in 0 335 80
negotiating 0 335 80
Bergoglio’s 0 335 80
planned 1 335 80
sellout 1 335 80
of 0 335 80
China’s 1 335 80
underground 1 335 80
Catholics 1 335 80
to 0 335 80
the 0 335 80
Communist 1 335 80
dictators 1 335 80
of 1 335 80
Beijing). 1 335 80

Viganò 0 335 81
wanted 0 335 81
to 0 335 81
know 0 335 81
why 0 335 81
McCarrick 0 335 81
had 0 335 81
apparently 0 335 81
been 0 335 81
relieved 0 335 81
of 0 335 81
the 0 335 81
sanctions. 0 335 81

During 0 335 82
the 0 335 82
audience 0 335 82
Bergoglio 0 335 82
queried: 0 335 82
“What 0 335 82
is 0 335 82
Cardinal 0 335 82
McCarrick 0 335 82
like?” 0 335 82
and 0 335 82
Viganò 0 335 82
replied 0 335 82
with 0 335 82
the 0 335 82
truth 0 335 82
Bergoglio 0 335 82
obviously 0 335 82
did 0 335 82
not 0 335 82
want 0 335 82
to 0 335 82
hear: 0 335 82

I 0 335 83
answered 0 335 83
him 0 335 83
with 0 335 83
complete 0 335 83
frankness 0 335 83
and, 0 335 83
if 0 335 83
you 0 335 83
want, 0 335 83
with 0 335 83
great 0 335 83
naiveté: 0 335 83
“Holy 0 335 83
Father, 0 335 83
I 0 335 83
don’t 0 335 83
know 0 335 83
if 0 335 83
you 0 335 83
know 0 335 83
Cardinal 0 335 83
McCarrick, 0 335 83
but 0 335 83
if 0 335 83
you 0 335 83
ask 0 335 83
the 0 335 83
Congregation 0 335 83
for 0 335 83
Bishops 0 335 83
there 0 335 83
is 0 335 83
a 0 335 83
dossier 0 335 83
this 0 335 83
thick 0 335 83
about 0 335 83
him. 0 335 83

He 0 335 84
corrupted 0 335 84
generations 0 335 84
of 0 335 84
seminarians 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
priests 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
Pope 0 335 84
Benedict 0 335 84
ordered 0 335 84
him 0 335 84
to 0 335 84
withdraw 0 335 84
to 0 335 84
a 0 335 84
life 0 335 84
of 0 335 84
prayer 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
penance.” 0 335 84
The 0 335 84
Pope 0 335 84
did 0 335 84
not 0 335 84
make 0 335 84
the 0 335 84
slightest 0 335 84
comment 0 335 84
about 0 335 84
those 0 335 84
very 1 335 84
grave 1 335 84
words 1 335 84
of 1 335 84
mine 1 335 84
and 0 335 84
did 0 335 84
not 0 335 84
show 0 335 84
any 0 335 84
expression 0 335 84
of 0 335 84
surprise 0 335 84
on 0 335 84
his 0 335 84
face, 0 335 84
as 0 335 84
if 0 335 84
he 0 335 84
had 0 335 84
already 0 335 84
known 0 335 84
the 0 335 84
matter 0 335 84
for 0 335 84
some 0 335 84
time, 0 335 84
and 0 335 84
he 0 335 84
immediately 0 335 84
changed 0 335 84
the 0 335 84
subject. 0 335 84

But 0 335 85
then, 0 335 85
what 0 335 85
was 0 335 85
the 0 335 85
Pope’s 0 335 85
purpose 0 335 85
in 0 335 85
asking 0 335 85
me 0 335 85
that 0 335 85
question: 0 335 85
“What 0 335 85
is 0 335 85
Cardinal 0 335 85
McCarrick 0 335 85
like?” 0 335 85
He 1 335 85
clearly 1 335 85
wanted 1 335 85
to 1 335 85
find 1 335 85
out 1 335 85
if 1 335 85
I 1 335 85
was 1 335 85
an 1 335 85
ally 1 335 85
of 1 335 85
McCarrick 1 335 85
or 1 335 85
not…. 1 335 85

It 0 335 86
was 0 335 86
also 0 335 86
clear 0 335 86
that, 0 335 86
from 0 335 86
the 0 335 86
time 0 335 86
of 0 335 86
Pope 0 335 86
Francis’s 0 335 86
election, 0 335 86
McCarrick, 0 335 86
now 0 335 86
free 0 335 86
from 0 335 86
all 0 335 86
constraints, 0 335 86
had 0 335 86
felt 0 335 86
free 0 335 86
to 0 335 86
travel 0 335 86
continuously, 0 335 86
to 0 335 86
give 0 335 86
lectures 0 335 86
and 0 335 86
interviews…. 0 335 86

He 0 335 87
[Bergoglio] 0 335 87
knew 0 335 87
from 0 335 87
at 0 335 87
least 0 335 87
June 0 335 87
23, 0 335 87
2013 0 335 87
[the 0 335 87
date 0 335 87
of 0 335 87
the 0 335 87
audience 0 335 87
with 0 335 87
Viganò] 0 335 87
that 0 335 87
McCarrick 0 335 87
was 0 335 87
a 1 335 87
serial 1 335 87
predator. 1 335 87

Although 0 335 88
he 0 335 88
knew 0 335 88
that 0 335 88
he 0 335 88
was 0 335 88
a 0 335 88
corrupt 1 335 88
man, 1 335 88
he 0 335 88
covered 0 335 88
for 0 335 88
him 0 335 88
to 1 335 88
the 1 335 88
bitter 1 335 88
end; 1 335 88
indeed, 0 335 88
he 0 335 88
made 0 335 88
McCarrick’s 0 335 88
advice 0 335 88
his 0 335 88
own, 0 335 88
which 0 335 88
was 0 335 88
certainly 0 335 88
not 0 335 88
inspired 0 335 88
by 0 335 88
sound 0 335 88
intentions 0 335 88
and 0 335 88
for 0 335 88
love 0 335 88
of 0 335 88
the 0 335 88
Church. 0 335 88

It 0 335 89
was 0 335 89
only 0 335 89
when 0 335 89
he 0 335 89
was 0 335 89
forced 0 335 89
by 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
report 0 335 89
of 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
abuse 0 335 89
of 0 335 89
a 0 335 89
minor, 0 335 89
again 0 335 89
on 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
basis 0 335 89
of 0 335 89
media 0 335 89
attention, 0 335 89
that 0 335 89
he 0 335 89
took 0 335 89
action 0 335 89
to 0 335 89
save 0 335 89
his 0 335 89
image 0 335 89
in 0 335 89
the 0 335 89
media. 0 335 89

[all 0 335 90
emphasis 0 335 90
in 0 335 90
original] 0 335 90

Before 0 335 91
his 0 335 91
long 0 335 91
overdue 0 335 91
fall 0 335 91
McCarrick, 0 335 91
as 0 335 91
Bergoglio’s 1 335 91
“trusted 1 335 91
counselor,” 1 335 91
had 0 335 91
been 0 335 91
instrumental 0 335 91
in 0 335 91
cementing 0 335 91
into 0 335 91
place 0 335 91
the 0 335 91
homosexual-friendly 0 335 91
status 0 335 91
quo 0 335 91
of 0 335 91
the 0 335 91
American 0 335 91
episcopate 0 335 91
that 0 335 91
oppresses 0 335 91
and 0 335 91
defrauds 0 335 91
the 0 335 91
faithful. 0 335 91

It 0 335 92
was 0 335 92
McCarrick, 0 335 92
noted 0 335 92
Marco 0 335 92
Tosatti, 0 335 92
who 0 335 92
was 0 335 92
behind 0 335 92
the 0 335 92
elevation 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Blase 0 335 92
Cupich 0 335 92
to 0 335 92
the 0 335 92
key 0 335 92
position 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Archbishop 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Chicago, 0 335 92
where 0 335 92
Cupich 0 335 92
has 0 335 92
since 0 335 92
promoted 0 335 92
the 0 335 92
homosexual 0 335 92
subversion 0 335 92
of 0 335 92
Father 0 335 92
James 0 335 92
Martin. 0 335 92

And 0 335 93
Viganò 0 335 93
now 0 335 93
confirms 0 335 93
Tosatti’s 0 335 93
allegation: 0 335 93
“The 0 335 93
appointments 0 335 93
of 0 335 93
Blase 0 335 93
Cupich 0 335 93
to 0 335 93
Chicago 0 335 93
and 0 335 93
Joseph 0 335 93
W. 0 335 93
Tobin 0 335 93
to 0 335 93
Newark 0 335 93
were 0 335 93
orchestrated 0 335 93
by 0 335 93
McCarrick, 0 335 93
Maradiaga 0 335 93
and 0 335 93
Wuerl, 0 335 93
united 1 335 93
by 1 335 93
a 1 335 93
wicked 1 335 93
pact 1 335 93
of 1 335 93
abuses 1 335 93
by 1 335 93
the 1 335 93
first, 1 335 93
and 1 335 93
at 1 335 93
least 1 335 93
of 1 335 93
coverup 1 335 93
of 1 335 93
abuses 1 335 93
by 1 335 93
the 1 335 93
other 1 335 93
two. 1 335 93

Their 0 335 94
names 0 335 94
were 0 335 94
not 0 335 94
among 0 335 94
those 0 335 94
presented 0 335 94
by 0 335 94
the 0 335 94
Nunciature 0 335 94
for 0 335 94
Chicago 0 335 94
and 0 335 94
Newark.” 0 335 94
That 0 335 94
is, 0 335 94
the 0 335 94
normal 0 335 94
process 0 335 94
was 0 335 94
circumvented 0 335 94
for 0 335 94
these 0 335 94
appointments. 0 335 94

Remnant 0 335 95
readers 0 335 95
may 0 335 95
recall 0 335 95
that 0 335 95
I 0 335 95
spotted 0 335 95
Cupich 0 335 95
back 0 335 95
in 0 335 95
2002, 0 335 95
when 0 335 95
he 0 335 95
was 0 335 95
the 1 335 95
obscure 1 335 95
Bishop 1 335 95
of 1 335 95
Rapid 1 335 95
City, 1 335 95
South 0 335 95
Dakota, 0 335 95
as 0 335 95
an 0 335 95
example 0 335 95
of 0 335 95
what 0 335 95
was 0 335 95
coming 0 335 95
in 0 335 95
the 0 335 95
Novus 0 335 95
Ordo: 0 335 95
accelerated 1 335 95
degeneration. 1 335 95

As 0 335 96
I 0 335 96
wrote 0 335 96
back 0 335 96
then, 0 335 96
with 0 335 96
the 0 335 96
likes 0 335 96
of 0 335 96
Cupich 0 335 96
in 0 335 96
view: 0 335 96

Cupich 0 335 97
is 0 335 97
the 0 335 97
very 0 335 97
model 0 335 97
of 0 335 97

He 1 335 98
is 1 335 98
the 1 335 98
very 1 335 98
exemplar 1 335 98
of 1 335 98
the 1 335 98
crisis 1 335 98
we 1 335 98
must 1 335 98
still 1 335 98
endure…. 1 335 98

Let 0 335 99
the 0 335 99
thing 0 335 99
die 0 335 99
of 0 335 99
its 0 335 99

excesses, 0 335 99
for 0 335 99
as 0 335 99
the 0 335 99
“little 0 335 99

[the 1 335 99
2002 1 335 99

demonstrates, 0 335 99
the 1 335 99
men 1 335 99
who 1 335 99
control 1 335 99
this 1 335 99
establishment 1 335 99
will 1 335 99
never 1 335 99
restore 1 335 99
it 1 335 99
to 1 335 99
anything 1 335 99
resembling 1 335 99

vibrant 1 335 99
Church 1 335 99
that 1 335 99
a 1 335 99
long 1 335 99
line 1 335 99
of 1 335 99
militant, 1 335 99
uncompromising 1 335 99
Popes 1 335 99

into 1 335 99
their 1 335 99
hands 1 335 99
at 1 335 99
Vatican 1 335 99
II. 1 335 99

For 1 335 100
heaven’s 1 335 100
sake, 1 335 100
the 0 335 100
men 0 335 100
who 0 335 100
govern 0 335 100
the 0 335 100

over 1 335 100
whether 0 335 100

should 0 335 100
be 0 335 100
defrocked. 0 335 100

From 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
Vatican 0 335 101
on 0 335 101
down, 0 335 101
through 0 335 101
deliberate 0 335 101
decisions 0 335 101
and 0 335 101
criminal 0 335 101
neglect, 0 335 101
the 1 335 101
servitors 1 335 101
of 1 335 101
Vatican 1 335 101
II 1 335 101
have 1 335 101
laid 1 335 101
waste 1 335 101
to 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
liturgy, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
perennial 0 335 101
clarity 0 335 101
of 0 335 101
Catholic 0 335 101
teaching, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
Church’s 0 335 101
militant 0 335 101
opposition 0 335 101
to 0 335 101
worldly 0 335 101
thinking, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101

in 0 335 101
seminaries, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
religious 0 335 101
orders, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
missions, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
trust 0 335 101
of 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
faithful 0 335 101
in 0 335 101
their 0 335 101
own 0 335 101
priests—in 0 335 101
short, 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
very 0 335 101
life 0 335 101
of 0 335 101
the 0 335 101
Church—and 0 335 101
dare 0 335 101
to 0 335 101
call 0 335 101
it 0 335 101
a 0 335 101
renewal. 0 335 101

We 1 335 102
must 1 335 102
no 1 335 102
longer 1 335 102
subsidize 1 335 102
the 1 335 102
malpractice 1 335 102
of 1 335 102
the 1 335 102
architects 1 335 102
of 1 335 102
ruin. 1 335 102

Nor 1 335 103
must 1 335 103
we 1 335 103
join 1 335 103
the 1 335 103
neo-Catholics 1 335 103
in 1 335 103
their 1 335 103
mindless 1 335 103
applause 1 335 103
when 1 335 103
one 1 335 103
of 1 335 103
these 1 335 103
incompetents 1 335 103
attempts 1 335 103
to 1 335 103
repoint 1 335 103
a 1 335 103
brick 1 335 103
or 1 335 103
two 1 335 103
in 1 335 103
the 1 335 103
crumbling 1 335 103
façade 1 335 103
they 1 335 103
have 1 335 103
erected 1 335 103
to 1 335 103
obscure 1 335 103
the 1 335 103
Church 1 335 103
of 1 335 103
old. 1 335 103

As 0 335 104
for 0 335 104
William 1 335 104
(“nighty-night 1 335 104
baby!”) 1 335 104
Tobin, 1 335 104
after 0 335 104
McCarrick 0 335 104
had 0 335 104
arranged 0 335 104
for 0 335 104
him 0 335 104
to 0 335 104
become 0 335 104
Archbishop 0 335 104
of 0 335 104
Newark, 0 335 104
Tobin, 0 335 104
another 1 335 104
episcopal 1 335 104
booster 1 335 104
of 1 335 104
Martin’s 1 335 104
pro-homosexual 1 335 104
propaganda, 1 335 104
promptly 0 335 104
sponsored 0 335 104
a 0 335 104
“gay 0 335 104
pilgrimage” 0 335 104
to 0 335 104
his 0 335 104
cathedral 0 335 104
in 0 335 104
Newark. 0 335 104

And 0 335 105
it 0 335 105
was 0 335 105
McCarrick 0 335 105
who 0 335 105
obtained 0 335 105
the 0 335 105
cardinal’s 0 335 105
hat 0 335 105
for 0 335 105
his 0 335 105
roommate 0 335 105
of 0 335 105
six 0 335 105
years, 0 335 105
Kevin 0 335 105
Farrell, 0 335 105
whom 0 335 105
he 0 335 105
consecrated 0 335 105
a 0 335 105
bishop. 0 335 105

Farrell, 0 335 106
yet 1 335 106
another 1 335 106
promoter 1 335 106
of 1 335 106
Martin’s 1 335 106
homosexual 1 335 106
activism, 1 335 106
arranged 0 335 106
for 0 335 106
Martin 0 335 106
to 0 335 106
“welcome 0 335 106
‘gay’ 0 335 106
families” 0 335 106
at 0 335 106
the 0 335 106
“World 0 335 106
Meeting 0 335 106
of 0 335 106
Families” 0 335 106
in 0 335 106
Dublin 0 335 106
from 0 335 106
which 0 335 106
Bergoglio 0 335 106
has 0 335 106
just 0 335 106
returned. 0 335 106

Finally, 0 335 107
there 0 335 107
is 0 335 107
the 0 335 107
appointment 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
the 0 335 107
“pro-gay” 1 335 107
Robert 1 335 107
McElroy 1 335 107
as 0 335 107
Bishop 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
San 0 335 107
Diego, 0 335 107
concerning 0 335 107
which 0 335 107
Viganò 0 335 107
reveals: 0 335 107
“The 0 335 107
appointment 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
McElroy 0 335 107
in 0 335 107
San 0 335 107
Diego 0 335 107
was 0 335 107
also 0 335 107
orchestrated 0 335 107
from 0 335 107
above, 0 335 107
with 0 335 107
an 0 335 107
encrypted 0 335 107
peremptory 0 335 107
order 0 335 107
to 0 335 107
me 0 335 107
as 0 335 107
Nuncio, 0 335 107
by 0 335 107
Cardinal 0 335 107
Parolin: 0 335 107
‘Reserve 0 335 107

McElroy 0 335 107

well 0 335 107
aware 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
McCarrick’s 0 335 107
abuses, 0 335 107

Like 0 335 107
Cupich, 0 335 107
Tobin 0 335 107
and 0 335 107
Farrell, 0 335 107
McElroy 0 335 107
is 0 335 107
an 1 335 107
avid 1 335 107
promoter 1 335 107
of 1 335 107
Martin’s 1 335 107
homosexual 1 335 107
subversion 1 335 107
of 1 335 107
the 1 335 107
Church, 1 335 107
calling 0 335 107
opposition 0 335 107
to 0 335 107
Martin 0 335 107
symptomatic 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
a 0 335 107
“cancer 1 335 107
of 1 335 107
vilification 1 335 107
[that] 0 335 107
is 0 335 107
seeping 0 335 107
into 0 335 107
the 0 335 107

life 0 335 107
of 0 335 107
the 0 335 107
church.” 0 335 107

Emboldened 0 335 108
by 0 335 108
the 0 335 108
certainty 0 335 108
that 0 335 108
he 0 335 108
will 0 335 108
face 0 335 108
no 0 335 108
discipline 0 335 108
whatsoever, 0 335 108
Martin, 0 335 108
now 0 335 108
backed 0 335 108
by 0 335 108
“Cupich, 0 335 108
Tobin, 0 335 108
Farrell 0 335 108
and 0 335 108
McElroy,” 0 335 108
as 0 335 108
Viganò 0 335 108
testifies, 0 335 108
is 0 335 108
urging 0 335 108
all 0 335 108
the 0 335 108
“gay 0 335 108
priests” 0 335 108
to 0 335 108
“come 0 335 108
out,” 0 335 108
including 0 335 108
those 0 335 108
ordained 0 335 108
since 0 335 108
the 0 335 108
useless 0 335 108
“pedophile 1 335 108
summit” 1 335 108
presided 0 335 108
over 0 335 108
by 0 335 108
none 0 335 108
other 0 335 108
than 0 335 108
McCarrick 0 335 108
as 0 335 108
the 1 335 108
classic 1 335 108
fox 1 335 108
in 1 335 108
charge 1 335 108
of 1 335 108
the 1 335 108
hen 1 335 108
house. 1 335 108

But 0 335 109
Bergoglio 0 335 109
has 0 335 109
also 0 335 109
lent 0 335 109
his 0 335 109
own 0 335 109
authority 0 335 109
to 0 335 109
Martin’s 0 335 109
effort 0 335 109
to 0 335 109
mainstream 0 335 109
homosexuality 0 335 109
in 0 335 109
the 0 335 109
Church. 0 335 109

As 0 335 110
Viganò 0 335 110
notes, 0 335 110
it 0 335 110
was 0 335 110
Bergoglio 0 335 110
who 0 335 110
made 0 335 110
Martin 0 335 110
a 0 335 110
“Consultor 0 335 110
of 0 335 110
the 0 335 110
Secretariat 0 335 110
for 0 335 110
Communications,” 0 335 110
even 0 335 110
though 0 335 110
he 0 335 110
is 0 335 110
a 1 335 110
“well-known 1 335 110

who 1 335 110
promotes 1 335 110

LGBT 1 335 110
agenda, 1 335 110
chosen 1 335 110
to 1 335 110
corrupt 1 335 110
the 1 335 110
young 1 335 110
people 1 335 110
who 1 335 110
will 1 335 110
soon 1 335 110
gather 1 335 110
in 1 335 110
Dublin 1 335 110
for 1 335 110
the 1 335 110
World 1 335 110
Meeting 1 335 110
of 1 335 110
Families…” 1 335 110

“Father” 0 335 111
Martin 0 335 111
now 0 335 111
confidently 0 335 111
declares, 0 335 111
sixteen 0 335 111
years 0 335 111
after 0 335 111
the 0 335 111
“pedophile 1 335 111
summit,” 1 335 111
that 0 335 111
“The 1 335 111
idea 1 335 111
of 1 335 111
a 1 335 111
purge 1 335 111
of 1 335 111
gay 1 335 111
priests 1 335 111
is 1 335 111
both 1 335 111
ridiculous 1 335 111
and 1 335 111
dangerous. 1 335 111

Any 1 335 112
purge 1 335 112
would 1 335 112
empty 1 335 112
parishes 1 335 112
and 1 335 112
religious 1 335 112
orders 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
the 1 335 112
thousands 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
priests 1 335 112
and 1 335 112
bishops 1 335 112
who 1 335 112
lead 1 335 112
healthy 1 335 112
lives 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
service 1 335 112
and 1 335 112
faithful 1 335 112
lives 1 335 112
of 1 335 112
celibacy.” 1 335 112

Martin 0 335 113
thus 0 335 113
revels 1 335 113
in 1 335 113
smug 1 335 113
certitude 1 335 113
that 0 335 113
the 0 335 113
future 0 335 113
of 0 335 113
the 0 335 113
universal 0 335 113
Church 0 335 113
is 0 335 113
in 0 335 113
the 0 335 113
hands 0 335 113
of 0 335 113
legions 1 335 113
of 1 335 113
intrinsically 1 335 113
disordered 1 335 113
homosexual 1 335 113
bishops 1 335 113
and 1 335 113
priests 1 335 113
and 0 335 113
their 0 335 113
homosexual 0 335 113
successors, 0 335 113
who 0 335 113
will 0 335 113
perpetuate 0 335 113
an 0 335 113
existing 0 335 113
worldwide 0 335 113
homosexual 0 335 113
network, 0 335 113
and 0 335 113
that 0 335 113
there 0 335 113
is 0 335 113
absolutely 0 335 113
nothing 0 335 113

resignation 1 335 129
of 1 335 129
some 1 335 129
bishops, 1 335 129
and 1 335 129
even 1 335 129
less 1 335 129
so 1 335 129
by 1 335 129
bureaucratic 1 335 129
directives. 1 335 129

The 1 335 130
deeper 1 335 130
problem 1 335 130
lies 1 335 130
in 1 335 130
homosexual 1 335 130
networks 1 335 130
within 1 335 130
the 1 335 130

must 1 335 130
be 1 335 130
eradicated.” 1 335 130
These 0 335 130
homosexual 0 335 130
networks, 0 335 130
which 0 335 130
are 0 335 130
now 0 335 130
widespread 0 335 130
in 0 335 130
many 0 335 130
dioceses, 0 335 130

the 0 335 130

of 0 335 130
secrecy 0 335 130
and 0 335 130
lies 0 335 130
with 1 335 130
the 1 335 130

and 1 335 130
priestly 1 335 130
vocations, 1 335 130
and 1 335 130
are 1 335 130
strangling 1 335 130

has 0 335 135
finally 0 335 135

Nearly 0 335 136
three 0 335 136
years 0 335 136
ago, 0 335 136
seeing 0 335 136
what 0 335 136
was 0 335 136
certainly 0 335 136
coming 0 335 136
on 0 335 136
the 0 335 136
disastrous 1 335 136
course 0 335 136
Bergoglio 0 335 136
had 0 335 136
already 0 335 136
clearly 0 335 136
established, 0 335 136
this 0 335 136
newspaper 0 335 136
published 0 335 136
a 0 335 136
petition 0 335 136
which 0 335 136
states: 0 335 136
“We 0 335 136
your 0 335 136

respectfully 0 335 136

Your 0 335 136

to 0 335 136
change 0 335 136
course 0 335 136

of 0 335 136

Failing 0 335 137
this, 0 335 137
would 0 335 137
it 0 335 137
not 0 335 137
be 0 335 137
better 0 335 137
for 0 335 137

to 0 335 137
be 0 335 137
a 0 335 137
catastrophic 1 335 137
compromise 1 335 137
of 0 335 137
the 0 335 137
Church’s 0 335 137
integrity?” 0 335 137
Our 0 335 137
petition 0 335 137
was 0 335 137
of 0 335 137
course 0 335 137
dismissed 0 335 137
as 0 335 137
“ridiculous” 1 335 137
by 0 335 137
the 0 335 137
neo-Catholic 0 335 137
commentariat. 0 335 137

Today, 0 335 138
our 0 335 138
ridiculous 0 335 138
suggestion 0 335 138
is 0 335 138
the 0 335 138
stuff 0 335 138
of 0 335 138
mainstream 0 335 138
news. 0 335 138

From 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
neo-Catholic 0 335 139
perspective, 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
events 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
recent 0 335 139
days 0 335 139
present 0 335 139
a 0 335 139
terrifying 1 335 139
prospect: 1 335 139
the 0 335 139
final 0 335 139
collapse 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
Novus 0 335 139
Ordo 0 335 139
establishment, 0 335 139
an 0 335 139
end 0 335 139
to 0 335 139
the 0 335 139
conciliar 0 335 139
aggiornamento 0 335 139
and 0 335 139
a 0 335 139
revival 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
integral 0 335 139
Tradition, 0 335 139
which 0 335 139
growing 0 335 139
numbers 0 335 139
of 0 335 139
young 0 335 139
people 0 335 139
are 0 335 139
seeking. 0 335 139

Hence 0 335 140
even 0 335 140
before 0 335 140
Archbishop 0 335 140
Viganò 0 335 140
had 0 335 140
come 0 335 140
forward, 0 335 140
commentators 0 335 140
like 0 335 140
Faggioli 0 335 140
were 0 335 140
already 0 335 140
sounding 1 335 140
the 1 335 140
neo-Catholic 1 335 140
air 1 335 140
raid 1 335 140
siren. 1 335 140

Faggioli 0 335 141
fretted 1 335 141
that 0 335 141
“[t]he 0 335 141
abuse 0 335 141
scandal 0 335 141
and 0 335 141
delegitimization 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
episcopate 0 335 141
has 0 335 141
created 0 335 141
a 0 335 141
great 0 335 141
power 0 335 141
vacuum 0 335 141
in 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
Church” 0 335 141
that 0 335 141
could 0 335 141
be 0 335 141
filled 0 335 141
by 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
“neo-traditionalist 0 335 141
Catholicism 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
younger 0 335 141
generations 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
American 0 335 141
Catholics” 0 335 141
who 0 335 141
“attack 0 335 141
American 0 335 141
bishops 0 335 141
and 0 335 141
cardinals 0 335 141
close 0 335 141
to 0 335 141
Pope 0 335 141
Francis.” 0 335 141
Accordingly, 0 335 141
he 0 335 141
rushed 0 335 141
to 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
defense 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
Bergoglio 0 335 141
and 0 335 141
his 1 335 141
corrupt 1 335 141
regime 1 335 141
against 0 335 141
“a 0 335 141
radicalization 0 335 141
of 0 335 141
religious 0 335 141
conservatism 0 335 141
in 0 335 141
the 0 335 141
neo-traditionalism 0 335 141
sense...” 0 335 141

For 1 335 142
Faggioli, 1 335 142
not 1 335 142
only 1 335 142
would 1 335 142
Bergoglio’s 1 335 142
resignation 1 335 142
be 1 335 142
unthinkable, 1 335 142
so 1 335 142
also 1 335 142
would 1 335 142
a 1 335 142
purge 1 335 142
of 1 335 142
the 1 335 142
homosexual 1 335 142
and 1 335 142
pro-homosexual 1 335 142
prelates 1 335 142
Bergoglio 1 335 142
and 1 335 142
his 1 335 142
Vatican 1 335 142
henchmen 1 335 142
have 1 335 142
systematically 1 335 142
enabled. 1 335 142

The 0 335 143
Pope, 0 335 143
he 0 335 143
argues, 0 335 143
is 0 335 143
not 0 335 143
“the 1 335 143
CEO 1 335 143
of 1 335 143
the 1 335 143
Catholic 1 335 143
Church 1 335 143
world, 1 335 143
and 0 335 143
the 0 335 143
bishops 0 335 143
as 0 335 143
its 0 335 143
managers 0 335 143
whom 0 335 143
the 0 335 143
Pope 0 335 143
can 0 335 143
simply 0 335 143
fire.” 0 335 143
No, 0 335 143
Bergoglio 0 335 143
cannot 0 335 143
“simply 0 335 143
fire” 0 335 143
bishops. 0 335 143

Except 0 335 144
whenever 0 335 144
he 0 335 144
pleases, 0 335 144
as 0 335 144
we 0 335 144
have 0 335 144
seen 0 335 144
again 0 335 144
and 0 335 144
again 0 335 144
with 0 335 144
the 1 335 144
conservative 1 335 144
bishops 1 335 144
and 1 335 144
even 1 335 144
Cardinals 1 335 144
(Burke 1 335 144
and 1 335 144
Müller) 1 335 144
he 1 335 144
has 1 335 144
sacked 1 335 144
because 1 335 144
their 1 335 144
conservatism 1 335 144
offended 1 335 144
him 1 335 144
or 1 335 144
one 1 335 144
of 1 335 144
his 1 335 144
friends, 1 335 144
prompting 0 335 144
even 0 335 144
Crux 0 335 144
to 0 335 144
ask: 0 335 144
“Does 1 335 144
Pope 1 335 144
Francis 1 335 144
have 1 335 144
an 1 335 144
enemies 1 335 144
list?” 1 335 144
Then 0 335 144
again, 0 335 144
Francis 0 335 144
even 0 335 144
obtained 0 335 144
the 0 335 144
removal 0 335 144
of 0 335 144
his 0 335 144
own 0 335 144
“trusted 1 335 144
counselor” 1 335 144
McCarrick 1 335 144
from 0 335 144
the 0 335 144
College 0 335 144
of 0 335 144
Cardinals, 0 335 144
albeit 0 335 144
only 0 335 144
when 0 335 144
forced 0 335 144
to 0 335 144
act 0 335 144
due 0 335 144
to 0 335 144
worldwide 0 335 144
condemnation 0 335 144
in 0 335 144
the 0 335 144
media. 0 335 144

So, 0 335 145
according 0 335 145
to 0 335 145
Faggioli, 0 335 145
the 1 335 145
same 1 335 145
Pope 1 335 145
who 1 335 145
sacks 1 335 145
conservative 1 335 145
bishops 1 335 145
and 1 335 145
cardinals 1 335 145
according 1 335 145
to 1 335 145
his 1 335 145
pleasure 1 335 145
and 1 335 145
has 1 335 145
just 1 335 145
removed 1 335 145
a 1 335 145
cardinal 1 335 145
from 1 335 145
the 1 335 145
College 1 335 145
of 1 335 145
Cardinals 1 335 145
in 1 335 145
an 1 335 145
unprecedented 1 335 145
disciplinary 1 335 145
act 1 335 145
under 1 335 145
fire 1 335 145
from 1 335 145
the 1 335 145
media, 1 335 145
is 1 335 145
somehow 1 335 145
powerless 1 335 145
to 1 335 145
dismiss 1 335 145
Modernist 1 335 145
bishops 1 335 145
who 1 335 145
have 1 335 145
created 1 335 145
an 1 335 145
obscene 1 335 145
“gay 1 335 145
culture” 1 335 145
in 1 335 145
the 1 335 145
Church 1 335 145
and 1 335 145
replace 1 335 145
them 1 335 145
with 1 335 145
orthodox, 1 335 145
normal 1 335 145
heterosexual 1 335 145
males. 1 335 145

Francis 1 335 146
cannot 1 335 146
“simply 1 335 146
fire” 1 335 146
even 1 335 146
Cardinal 1 335 146
Wuerl, 1 335 146
who 1 335 146
covered 1 335 146
up 1 335 146
crimes 1 335 146
of 1 335 146
homosexual 1 335 146
predation 1 335 146
by 1 335 146

Wuerl, 0 335 147
says 0 335 147
Faggioli, 0 335 147
“faces 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
complex 0 335 147
situation: 0 335 147
on 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
one 0 335 147
hand 0 335 147
Wuerl 0 335 147
was 0 335 147
not 0 335 147
afraid 0 335 147
of 0 335 147
clashing 0 335 147
with 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
tribunal 0 335 147
over 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
Apostolic 0 335 147
Signatura 0 335 147
in 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
Vatican 0 335 147
which 0 335 147
wanted 0 335 147
to 0 335 147
readmit 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
priest 0 335 147
from 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
Pittsburgh 0 335 147
diocese 0 335 147
to 0 335 147
ministry… 0 335 147
while 0 335 147
in 0 335 147
other 0 335 147
cases 0 335 147
he 0 335 147
seems 0 335 147
to 0 335 147
have 0 335 147
collaborated 0 335 147
in 0 335 147
covering 0 335 147
up 0 335 147
some 0 335 147
cases… 0 335 147
It 0 335 147
is 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
very 0 335 147
difficult 0 335 147
position 0 335 147
also 0 335 147
because 0 335 147
Wuerl 0 335 147
became 0 335 147
a 0 335 147
symbol… 0 335 147
beyond 0 335 147
the 0 335 147
specific 0 335 147
accusations 0 335 147
against 0 335 147
him, 0 335 147
from 0 335 147
which 0 335 147
he 0 335 147
could 0 335 147
not 0 335 147
publicly 0 335 147
defend 0 335 147
himself.” 0 335 147

In 0 335 148
other 0 335 148
words, 0 335 148
because 0 335 148
his 0 335 148
situation 0 335 148
is 0 335 148
“complex” 0 335 148
Wuerl, 0 335 148
unlike 0 335 148
McCarrick, 0 335 148
should 0 335 148
remain 0 335 148
a 0 335 148
cardinal 0 335 148
and 0 335 148
the 0 335 148
Archbishop 0 335 148
of 0 335 148
Washington, 0 335 148
DC, 0 335 148
thus 0 335 148
maintaining 1 335 148
a 1 335 148
key 1 335 148
bulwark 1 335 148
against 1 335 148
the 1 335 148
“neo-traditionalist” 1 335 148
threat. 1 335 148

Yet, 0 335 149
as 0 335 149
the 0 335 149
Pennsylvania 0 335 149
grand 0 335 149
jury 0 335 149
report 0 335 149
documents, 0 335 149
Wuerl 0 335 149
assisted 0 335 149
McCarrick 0 335 149
in 0 335 149
the 0 335 149
coverup 0 335 149
of 0 335 149
his 0 335 149
crimes 0 335 149
and 0 335 149
now 0 335 149
brazenly 1 335 149
lies 1 335 149
about 1 335 149
it. 1 335 149

Here 0 335 150
too 0 335 150
Viganò’s 0 335 150
testimony 0 335 150
sheds 1 335 150
light 1 335 150
on 1 335 150
the 1 335 150
darkness: 1 335 150

…. 0 335 151

I 0 335 152
myself 0 335 152
brought 0 335 152
up 0 335 152
the 0 335 152
subject 0 335 152
[of 0 335 152
McCarrick] 0 335 152
with 0 335 152
Cardinal 0 335 152
Wuerl 0 335 152
on 0 335 152
several 0 335 152
occasions, 0 335 152
and 0 335 152
I 0 335 152
certainly 0 335 152
didn’t 0 335 152
need 0 335 152
to 0 335 152
go 0 335 152
into 0 335 152
detail 0 335 152
because 0 335 152
it 0 335 152
was 0 335 152
immediately 0 335 152
clear 0 335 152
to 0 335 152
me 0 335 152
that 0 335 152
he 0 335 152
was 0 335 152
fully 0 335 152
aware 0 335 152
of 0 335 152
it. 0 335 152

I 0 335 153
also 0 335 153
remember 0 335 153
in 0 335 153
particular 0 335 153
the 0 335 153
fact 0 335 153
that 0 335 153
I 0 335 153
had 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
draw 0 335 153
his 0 335 153
attention 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
it, 0 335 153
because 0 335 153
I 0 335 153
realized 0 335 153
that 0 335 153
in 0 335 153
an 0 335 153
archdiocesan 0 335 153
publication, 0 335 153
on 0 335 153
the 0 335 153
back 0 335 153
cover 0 335 153
in 0 335 153
color, 0 335 153
there 0 335 153
was 0 335 153
an 0 335 153
announcement 0 335 153
inviting 0 335 153
young 0 335 153
men 0 335 153
who 0 335 153
thought 0 335 153
they 0 335 153
had 0 335 153
a 0 335 153
vocation 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
the 0 335 153
priesthood 0 335 153
to 0 335 153
a 0 335 153
meeting 0 335 153
with 0 335 153
Cardinal 0 335 153
McCarrick. 0 335 153

I 0 335 154
immediately 0 335 154
phoned 0 335 154
Cardinal 0 335 154
Wuerl, 0 335 154
who 0 335 154
expressed 0 335 154
his 0 335 154
surprise 0 335 154
to 0 335 154
me, 0 335 154
telling 0 335 154
me 0 335 154
that 0 335 154
he 0 335 154
knew 0 335 154
nothing 0 335 154
about 0 335 154
that 0 335 154
announcement 0 335 154
and 0 335 154
that 0 335 154
he 0 335 154
would 0 335 154
cancel 0 335 154
it. 0 335 154

If, 1 335 155
as 1 335 155
he 1 335 155
now 1 335 155
continues 1 335 155
to 1 335 155
state, 1 335 155
he 1 335 155
knew 1 335 155
nothing 1 335 155
of 1 335 155
the 1 335 155
abuses 1 335 155
committed 1 335 155
by 1 335 155
McCarrick 1 335 155
and 1 335 155
the 1 335 155
measures 1 335 155
taken 1 335 155
by 1 335 155
Pope 1 335 155
Benedict, 1 335 155
how 1 335 155
can 1 335 155
his 1 335 155
answer 1 335 155
be 1 335 155
explained? 1 335 155

His 0 335 156
recent 0 335 156
statements 0 335 156
that 0 335 156
he 0 335 156
knew 0 335 156
nothing 0 335 156
about 0 335 156
it, 0 335 156
even 0 335 156
though 0 335 156
at 0 335 156
first 0 335 156
he 0 335 156
cunningly 0 335 156
referred 0 335 156
to 0 335 156
compensation 0 335 156
for 0 335 156
the 0 335 156
two 0 335 156
victims, 0 335 156
are 0 335 156
absolutely 1 335 156
laughable. 1 335 156

The 0 335 157
Cardinal 0 335 157
lies 1 335 157
shamelessly 1 335 157
and 0 335 157
prevails 0 335 157
upon 0 335 157
his 0 335 157
Chancellor, 0 335 157
Monsignor 0 335 157
Antonicelli, 0 335 157
to 0 335 157
lie 0 335 157
as 0 335 157
well. 0 335 157

Cardinal 0 335 158
Wuerl 0 335 158
also 0 335 158
clearly 0 335 158
lied 0 335 158
on 0 335 158
another 0 335 158
occasion. 0 335 158

Following 0 335 159
a 0 335 159
morally 0 335 159
unacceptable 0 335 159
event 0 335 159
authorized 0 335 159
by 0 335 159
the 0 335 159
academic 0 335 159
authorities 0 335 159
of 0 335 159
Georgetown 0 335 159
University, 0 335 159
I 0 335 159
brought 0 335 159
it 0 335 159
to 0 335 159
the 0 335 159
attention 0 335 159
of 0 335 159
its 0 335 159
President, 0 335 159
Dr. 0 335 159
John 0 335 159
DeGioia, 0 335 159
sending 0 335 159
him 0 335 159
two 0 335 159
subsequent 0 335 159
letters. 0 335 159

Before 0 335 160
forwarding 0 335 160
them 0 335 160
to 0 335 160
the 0 335 160
addressee, 0 335 160
so 0 335 160
as 0 335 160
to 0 335 160
handle 0 335 160
things 0 335 160
properly, 0 335 160
I 0 335 160
personally 0 335 160
gave 0 335 160
a 0 335 160
copy 0 335 160
of 0 335 160
them 0 335 160
to 0 335 160
the 0 335 160
Cardinal 0 335 160
with 0 335 160
an 0 335 160
accompanying 0 335 160
letter 0 335 160
I 0 335 160
had 0 335 160
written. 0 335 160

The 0 335 161
Cardinal 0 335 161
told 0 335 161
me 0 335 161
that 0 335 161
he 0 335 161
knew 0 335 161
nothing 0 335 161
about 0 335 161
it. 0 335 161

However, 1 335 162
he 1 335 162
failed 1 335 162
to 1 335 162
acknowledge 1 335 162
receipt 1 335 162
of 1 335 162
my 1 335 162
two 1 335 162
letters, 1 335 162
contrary 1 335 162
to 1 335 162
what 1 335 162
he 1 335 162
customarily 1 335 162
did. 1 335 162

I 0 335 163
subsequently 0 335 163
learned 0 335 163
that 0 335 163
the 0 335 163
event 0 335 163
at 0 335 163
Georgetown 0 335 163
had 0 335 163
taken 0 335 163
place 0 335 163
for 0 335 163
seven 0 335 163
years. 0 335 163

But 0 335 164
the 0 335 164
Cardinal 0 335 164
knew 0 335 164
nothing 0 335 164
about 0 335 164
it! 0 335 164

Cardinal 0 335 165
Wuerl, 0 335 165
well 0 335 165
aware 0 335 165
of 0 335 165
the 0 335 165
continuous 0 335 165
abuses 0 335 165
committed 0 335 165
by 0 335 165
Cardinal 0 335 165
McCarrick 0 335 165
and 0 335 165
the 0 335 165
sanctions 0 335 165
imposed 0 335 165
on 0 335 165
him 0 335 165
by 0 335 165
Pope 0 335 165
Benedict, 0 335 165
transgressing 0 335 165
the 0 335 165
Pope’s 0 335 165
order, 0 335 165
also 0 335 165
allowed 0 335 165
him 0 335 165
to 0 335 165
reside 0 335 165
at 0 335 165
a 0 335 165
seminary 0 335 165
in 0 335 165
Washington 0 335 165
D.C. 0 335 165

In 0 335 166
doing 0 335 166
so, 0 335 166
he 1 335 166
put 1 335 166
other 1 335 166
seminarians 1 335 166
at 1 335 166
risk. 1 335 166

[emphasis 0 335 167
in 0 335 167
original] 0 335 167

What 0 335 168
really 0 335 168
concerns 0 335 168
Faggioli 0 335 168
and 0 335 168
those 0 335 168
who 0 335 168
think 0 335 168
like 0 335 168
him 0 335 168
is 0 335 168
not 0 335 168
Wuerl 0 335 168
and 0 335 168
his 0 335 168
“complex 0 335 168
situation,” 0 335 168
which 0 335 168
is 0 335 168
not 0 335 168
complex 0 335 168
at 0 335 168
all. 0 335 168

Rather, 0 335 169
what 0 335 169
he 0 335 169
views 0 335 169
with 0 335 169
alarm 0 335 169
as 0 335 169
an 0 335 169
“essential 0 335 169
element” 0 335 169
of 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
context 0 335 169
in 0 335 169
which 0 335 169
Wuerl 0 335 169
operates 0 335 169
is 0 335 169
that 0 335 169
“scandals 0 335 169
are 0 335 169
also 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
opportunity 0 335 169
for 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
neo-traditionalist 0 335 169
Catholicism 0 335 169
of 0 335 169
the 0 335 169
younger 0 335 169
generations 0 335 169
of 0 335 169
American 0 335 169
Catholics 0 335 169
to 0 335 169
attack 0 335 169
American 0 335 169
bishops 0 335 169
and 0 335 169
cardinals 0 335 169
close 0 335 169
to 0 335 169
Pope 0 335 169
Francis….” 0 335 169
Better 1 335 169
a 1 335 169
thousand 1 335 169
septuagenarian 1 335 169
Wuerls 1 335 169
in 1 335 169
their 1 335 169
lavish 1 335 169
sties 1 335 169
of 1 335 169
corruption, 1 335 169
financed 1 335 169
by 1 335 169
the 1 335 169
faithful, 1 335 169
than 1 335 169
a 1 335 169
single, 1 335 169
young 1 335 169
neo-traditionalist 1 335 169
prelate! 1 335 169

But 0 335 170
what 0 335 170
exactly 0 335 170
is 0 335 170
a 0 335 170
neo-traditionalist? 0 335 170

Quite 0 335 171
simply: 0 335 171
an 1 335 171
orthodox 1 335 171
Catholic 1 335 171
who 1 335 171
has 1 335 171
had 1 335 171
enough 1 335 171
of 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
homosexual-infested 1 335 171
regime 1 335 171
of 1 335 171
novelty 1 335 171
imposed 1 335 171
on 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
Church 1 335 171
by 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
old 1 335 171
men 1 335 171
of 1 335 171
the 1 335 171
Council, 1 335 171
Bergoglio 0 335 171
merely 0 335 171
being 0 335 171
the 0 335 171
latest, 0 335 171
the 0 335 171
highest 0 335 171
placed, 0 335 171
and 0 335 171
one 0 335 171
of 0 335 171
the 0 335 171
last. 0 335 171

As 1 335 172
Faggioli 1 335 172
puts 1 335 172
it: 1 335 172
“In 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
last 1 335 172
fifteen 1 335 172
years, 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
American 1 335 172
Catholic 1 335 172
Church 1 335 172
has 1 335 172
been 1 335 172
traversed 1 335 172
by 1 335 172
a 1 335 172
radicalization 1 335 172
of 1 335 172
religious 1 335 172
conservatism 1 335 172
in 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
neo-traditionalism 1 335 172
sense, 1 335 172
especially 1 335 172
in 1 335 172
the 1 335 172
younger 1 335 172
generations 1 335 172
of 1 335 172
priests 1 335 172
and 1 335 172
intellectuals. 1 335 172

They 1 335 173
interpret 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
current 1 335 173
abuse 1 335 173
crisis 1 335 173
as 1 335 173
fruit 1 335 173
of 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
mistakes 1 335 173
of 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
Council 1 335 173
itself 1 335 173
and 1 335 173
not 1 335 173
only 1 335 173
of 1 335 173
the 1 335 173
post-Council…” 1 335 173

Just 0 335 174
as 0 335 174
Faggioli 0 335 174
fears, 0 335 174
many 0 335 174
in 0 335 174
the 0 335 174
up-and-coming 0 335 174
generation 0 335 174
of 0 335 174
Catholic 0 335 174
clergy 0 335 174
and 0 335 174
laity 0 335 174
recognize 0 335 174
the 0 335 174
obvious: 0 335 174
that 0 335 174
the 0 335 174
conciliar 0 335 174
texts, 0 335 174
for 0 335 174
all 0 335 174
their 0 335 174
prolix 0 335 174
repetition 0 335 174
of 0 335 174
traditional 0 335 174
teaching, 0 335 174
opened 1 335 174
the 1 335 174
way 1 335 174
to 1 335 174
ecclesial 1 335 174
disaster. 1 335 174

Sacrosanctum 0 335 175
Concilium—the 0 335 175
Council 0 335 175
verbally 0 335 175
prostrated 0 335 175
itself 0 335 175
before 0 335 175
“the 0 335 175

become 0 335 175
Sacrosanctum 0 335 175

to 0 335 175

demolition 1 335 175
of 1 335 175
the 1 335 175
sacred 1 335 175
liturgy 1 335 175
that 0 335 175
was 0 335 175
the 0 335 175
very 0 335 175
foundation 0 335 175
Catholic 0 335 175
of 0 335 175
orthodoxy 0 335 175
and 0 335 175
orthopraxis. 0 335 175

To 0 335 176
quote 0 335 176
Paul 0 335 176
VI, 0 335 176
then 0 335 176
in 1 335 176
the 1 335 176
depths 1 335 176
of 1 335 176
his 1 335 176
conciliar 1 335 176
delirium 1 335 176
at 0 335 176
the 0 335 176
Council’s 0 335 176
close: 0 335 176

But 0 335 177
one 0 335 177
must 0 335 177
realize 0 335 177
that 0 335 177
this 0 335 177
council, 0 335 177
which 0 335 177
exposed 0 335 177
itself 0 335 177
to 0 335 177
human 0 335 177
judgment, 0 335 177
insisted 0 335 177
very 0 335 177
much 0 335 177
more 0 335 177
upon 0 335 177
this 0 335 177
pleasant 0 335 177
side 0 335 177
of 0 335 177
man, 0 335 177
rather 0 335 177
than 0 335 177
on 0 335 177
his 0 335 177
unpleasant 0 335 177
one. 0 335 177

Its 0 335 178
attitude 0 335 178
was 0 335 178
very 0 335 178
much 0 335 178
and 0 335 178
deliberately 0 335 178
optimistic. 0 335 178

A 0 335 179
wave 1 335 179
of 1 335 179
affection 1 335 179
and 1 335 179
admiration 1 335 179
flowed 1 335 179
from 1 335 179
the 1 335 179
council 1 335 179
over 1 335 179
the 1 335 179
modern 1 335 179
world 1 335 179
of 1 335 179
humanity…. 1 335 179

Instead 0 335 180
of 0 335 180
depressing 0 335 180
diagnoses, 0 335 180
encouraging 0 335 180
remedies; 0 335 180
instead 0 335 180
of 0 335 180
direful 0 335 180
prognostics, 0 335 180
messages 0 335 180
of 0 335 180
trust 0 335 180
issued 0 335 180
from 0 335 180
the 0 335 180
council 0 335 180
to 0 335 180
the 0 335 180
present-day 0 335 180
world. 0 335 180

The 0 335 181
modern 0 335 181
world’s 0 335 181
values 0 335 181
were 0 335 181
not 0 335 181
only 0 335 181
respected 0 335 181
but 0 335 181
honored, 0 335 181
its 0 335 181
efforts 0 335 181
approved, 0 335 181
its 1 335 181
aspirations 1 335 181
purified 1 335 181
and 1 335 181
blessed. 1 335 181

[emphasis 0 335 182
added] 0 335 182

Thus 1 335 183
did 1 335 183
Paul 1 335 183
describe 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
conciliar 1 335 183
“opening 1 335 183
to 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
world” 1 335 183
through 1 335 183
which 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
world 1 335 183
promptly 1 335 183
invaded 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
Church, 1 335 183
including 1 335 183
large 1 335 183
numbers 1 335 183
of 1 335 183
homosexuals 1 335 183
who 1 335 183
should 1 335 183
never 1 335 183
have 1 335 183
been 1 335 183
admitted 1 335 183
to 1 335 183
the 1 335 183
seminary. 1 335 183

In 0 335 184
sum, 0 335 184
Faggioli 0 335 184
is 0 335 184
representative 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
thinking 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
requires 0 335 184
defense 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
a 0 335 184
homosexualized 0 335 184
clergy 0 335 184
if 0 335 184
only 0 335 184
for 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
reason 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
tradition-minded 0 335 184
Catholics 0 335 184
cannot 0 335 184
be 0 335 184
allowed 0 335 184
to 0 335 184
take 0 335 184
their 0 335 184
place: 0 335 184
“This 0 335 184
neo-traditionalist 0 335 184
Catholicism 0 335 184
believes 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
sexual 0 335 184

are 0 335 184
committed 0 335 184
only 0 335 184
by 0 335 184
homosexual 0 335 184
clergy… 0 335 184
and 0 335 184
that 0 335 184
the 0 335 184
crisis 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
abuse 0 335 184
can 0 335 184
be 0 335 184
resolved 0 335 184
by 0 335 184
a 0 335 184
kind 0 335 184
of 0 335 184

in 0 335 184
dialogue 0 335 184
with 0 335 184
modern 0 335 184
culture, 0 335 184
and 0 335 184
replaced 0 335 184
by 0 335 184
a 1 335 184
young 1 335 184
clergy 1 335 184
marked 1 335 184
by 1 335 184
personal 1 335 184
sanctity 1 335 184
but 1 335 184
also 1 335 184
by 1 335 184
a 1 335 184
fascination 1 335 184

of 0 335 184

a 0 335 184
principle 0 335 184
of 0 335 184
reality.” 0 335 184

Rather 0 335 185
than 0 335 185
“young 1 335 185

the 0 335 185
neo-Catholic 0 335 185

that 0 335 185

It 0 335 185
is 0 335 185
not 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
integrity 0 335 185
of 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
Faith 0 335 185
that 0 335 185
matters 0 335 185
but 0 335 185
only 0 335 185
perpetuation 0 335 185
of 0 335 185
the 0 335 185
post-conciliar 0 335 185
regime 0 335 185
of 0 335 185
novelty. 0 335 185

Any 1 335 186
abandonment 1 335 186
of 1 335 186
the 1 335 186
regime 1 335 186
must 1 335 186
be 1 335 186
viewed 1 335 186
as 1 335 186
ecclesiastical 1 335 186
treason—“Catholic 1 335 186
Jacobinism”—if 1 335 186
not 1 335 186
criminal 1 335 186
activity. 1 335 186

Faggioli 0 335 187
would 0 335 187
probably 0 335 187
be 0 335 187
more 0 335 187

“Homosexuality 1 335 188

fleetingly 0 335 188

toward 0 335 188
the 0 335 188

after 1 335 188
generation? 1 335 188

Faggioli 0 335 189
has 0 335 189
no 0 335 189
answer 0 335 189
because 0 335 189
what 1 335 189
he 1 335 189
is 1 335 189
really 1 335 189
arguing—the 1 335 189
final 1 335 189
beachhead 1 335 189
of 1 335 189
the 1 335 189
neo-Catholic 1 335 189
defense 1 335 189
of 1 335 189
their 1 335 189
disintegrating 1 335 189
regime—is 1 335 189
that 1 335 189
homosexuals 1 335 189
in 1 335 189
the 1 335 189
hierarchy 1 335 189
must 1 335 189
remain 1 335 189
in 1 335 189
authority 1 335 189
as 1 335 189
an 1 335 189
indispensable 1 335 189
seawall 1 335 189
against 1 335 189
a 1 335 189
“neo-traditionalist” 1 335 189
storm 1 335 189
surge. 1 335 189

Faggioli’s 1 335 190
argument 1 335 190
demonstrates 1 335 190
that 1 335 190
neo-Catholicism 1 335 190
has 1 335 190
never 1 335 190
been 1 335 190
about 1 335 190
making 1 335 190
the 1 335 190
authentic 1 335 190
Faith 1 335 190
more 1 335 190
appealing 1 335 190
to 1 335 190
a 1 335 190
“modern 1 335 190
world” 1 335 190
founded 1 335 190
precisely 1 335 190
on 1 335 190
a 1 335 190
rejection 1 335 190
of 1 335 190
the 1 335 190
Church’s 1 335 190
authority. 1 335 190

It 1 335 191
is 1 335 191
not 1 335 191
about 1 335 191
the 1 335 191
Faith 1 335 191
at 1 335 191
all. 1 335 191

Rather, 1 335 192
it 1 335 192
is 1 335 192
an 1 335 192
ideological 1 335 192
movement 1 335 192
dedicated 1 335 192
to 1 335 192
the 1 335 192
face-saving 1 335 192
defense 1 335 192
of 1 335 192
a 1 335 192
catastrophic 1 335 192
failure 1 335 192
in 1 335 192
ecclesial 1 335 192
innovation 1 335 192
that 1 335 192
has 1 335 192
corrupted 1 335 192
the 1 335 192
human 1 335 192
element 1 335 192
of 1 335 192
the 1 335 192
Church 1 335 192
in 1 335 192
practically 1 335 192
every 1 335 192
department. 1 335 192

For 0 335 193
people 0 335 193
like 0 335 193
Faggioli, 0 335 193
indeed 0 335 193
for 0 335 193
the 1 335 193
tradition-hating 1 335 193
Pope 1 335 193
they 0 335 193
blindly 0 335 193
defend, 0 335 193
the 0 335 193
one 0 335 193
thing 0 335 193
to 0 335 193
be 0 335 193
feared 0 335 193
is 0 335 193
that 0 335 193
more 1 335 193
and 1 335 193
more 1 335 193
faithful 1 335 193
will 1 335 193
recognize 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
neo-Catholic 1 335 193
polemic 1 335 193
for 1 335 193
what 1 335 193
it 1 335 193
is—a 1 335 193
fraud—and 1 335 193
begin 1 335 193
demanding 1 335 193
a 1 335 193
return 1 335 193
of 1 335 193
everything 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
regime 1 335 193
of 1 335 193
novelty 1 335 193
has 1 335 193
stolen 1 335 193
from 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
life 1 335 193
of 1 335 193
the 1 335 193
Church. 1 335 193

That 1 335 194
is 1 335 194
exactly 1 335 194
what 1 335 194
a 1 335 194
growing 1 335 194
number 1 335 194
of 1 335 194
Catholics 1 335 194
are 1 335 194
now 1 335 194
doing, 1 335 194
as 1 335 194
even 1 335 194
the 1 335 194
secular 1 335 194
press 1 335 194
recognized 1 335 194
less 1 335 194
than 1 335 194
three 1 335 194
months 1 335 194
before 1 335 194
Bergoglio 1 335 194
began 1 335 194
his 1 335 194
tyrannical 1 335 194
reign. 1 335 194

In 0 335 195
this 0 335 195
respect, 0 335 195
what 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
neo-Catholics 0 335 195
are 0 335 195
defending 0 335 195
at 0 335 195
bottom 0 335 195
is 0 335 195
themselves—that 0 335 195
is, 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
reputations 0 335 195
they 0 335 195
have 0 335 195
all 0 335 195
staked 0 335 195
on 0 335 195
their 0 335 195
defense 0 335 195
of 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
indefensible 0 335 195
against 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
traditionalists 0 335 195
they 0 335 195
have 0 335 195
arrogantly 0 335 195
mocked 0 335 195
and 0 335 195
marginalized 0 335 195
for 0 335 195
decades 0 335 195
only 0 335 195
to 0 335 195
see, 0 335 195
to 1 335 195
their 1 335 195
horror, 1 335 195
that 0 335 195
traditionalism 0 335 195
is 0 335 195
ever 0 335 195
more 0 335 195
vindicated 0 335 195
as 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
scandals 0 335 195
of 0 335 195
the 0 335 195
Novus 0 335 195
Ordo 0 335 195
mount 1 335 195
under 1 335 195
this 1 335 195
reckless 1 335 195
Pope 1 335 195
to 1 335 195
an 1 335 195
unsustainable, 1 335 195
indeed 1 335 195
apocalyptic, 1 335 195
level. 1 335 195

A 0 335 196
return 0 335 196
to 0 335 196
integral 0 335 196
Tradition 0 335 196
is 0 335 196
the 0 335 196
threat 0 335 196
that 0 335 196
Faggioli 0 335 196
sees 0 335 196
as 0 335 196
coming 0 335 196
particularly 0 335 196
from 0 335 196
the 0 335 196
young. 0 335 196

Irony 1 335 197
of 1 335 197
ironies, 1 335 197
he 0 335 197
is 0 335 197
now 0 335 197
reduced 0 335 197
to 0 335 197
defending 0 335 197
what 0 335 197
is 0 335 197
old 0 335 197
and 0 335 197
tired 0 335 197
and 0 335 197
corrupt 0 335 197
against 0 335 197
a 0 335 197
restoration, 0 335 197
led 0 335 197
largely 0 335 197
by 0 335 197
a 1 335 197
youthful 1 335 197
vanguard, 1 335 197
of 1 335 197
what 1 335 197
is 1 335 197
ever 1 335 197
ancient 1 335 197
but 1 335 197
ever 1 335 197
new. 1 335 197

For 0 335 198
some, 0 335 198
it 0 335 198
seems, 0 335 198
no 0 335 198
price 0 335 198
is 0 335 198
too 0 335 198
great—not 0 335 198
even 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
good 0 335 198
of 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
Church—to 0 335 198
avoid 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
personal 0 335 198
ignominy 0 335 198
of 0 335 198
being 0 335 198
seen 0 335 198
on 0 335 198
the 0 335 198
wrong 0 335 198
side 0 335 198
of 0 335 198
history. 0 335 198

Conclusion: 0 335 199
The 0 335 199
Fatima 0 335 199
Connection 0 335 199

Long 0 335 200
before 0 335 200
the 0 335 200
arrival 0 335 200
of 0 335 200
Bergoglio 0 335 200
in 0 335 200

Sodano 0 335 200
and 0 335 200
Tarcisio 0 335 200
Bertone, 0 335 200
were 0 335 200
instrumental 0 335 200
in 0 335 200
advancing 0 335 200
the 0 335 200
homosexual 0 335 200

all 0 335 202

My 0 335 203
two 0 335 203
above-mentioned 0 335 203

were 0 335 203
also 0 335 203
presumably 0 335 203
handed 0 335 203
over 0 335 203

As 0 335 204
already 0 335 204

the 0 335 204

I 0 335 204

only 0 335 204
the 0 335 204

later 0 335 204
removed 0 335 204
because 0 335 204

undermining 0 335 204
his 0 335 204

Cardinal 0 335 205
Angelo 0 335 205
Sodano 0 335 205

In 0 335 206
November 0 335 206
2000, 0 335 206
Nunzio 0 335 206
Montalvo 0 335 206

passing 0 335 206
on 0 335 206

him 0 335 206
the 0 335 206

Father 0 335 206
Boniface 0 335 206
Ramsey 0 335 206
in 0 335 206
which 0 335 206
he 0 335 206
denounced 0 335 206
the 0 335 206
serious 0 335 206
abuses 0 335 206
committed 0 335 206
by 0 335 206
McCarrick. 0 335 206

It 0 335 207
is 0 335 207
known 0 335 207
that 0 335 207
Sodano 0 335 207

He 0 335 208
even 0 335 208
removed 0 335 208
the 0 335 208

Sodano 0 335 209
even 0 335 209
went 0 335 209
so 0 335 209
far 0 335 209
as 0 335 209

affirmed, 0 335 209
that 0 335 209

that 0 335 209

should 0 335 209
be 0 335 209
considered 0 335 209
closed. 0 335 209

Benedict 0 335 210
reacted, 0 335 210
despite 0 335 210
Sodano’s 0 335 210
strenuous 0 335 210
defense, 0 335 210
and 0 335 210
Maciel 0 335 210
was 0 335 210
found 0 335 210
guilty 0 335 210
and 0 335 210
irrevocably 1 335 210
condemned. 1 335 210

It 0 335 211

taken 0 335 211
the 0 335 211
leading 0 335 211
role 0 335 211
in 0 335 211
suppressing 0 335 211
the 0 335 211

admonitory 1 335 211
content 1 335 211

Inside 0 335 212
the 0 335 212
Vatican: 0 335 212

We 0 335 213
were 0 335 213
discussing 0 335 213
the 0 335 213
Third 0 335 213
Secret 0 335 213
of 0 335 213
Fatima, 0 335 213

allegations 0 335 213
that 0 335 213

Vatican 0 335 213
has 0 335 213
not 0 335 213

the 0 335 213

of 0 335 213
Cardinal 0 335 213
Tarcisio 0 335 213

a 0 335 213
book 0 335 213
where 0 335 213
Bertone 0 335 213
states 0 335 213
that 0 335 213
there 0 335 213
is 0 335 213
nothing 0 335 213
more 0 335 213
to 0 335 213
be 0 335 213

Sambi 0 335 214
said, 0 335 214
“Excuse 0 335 214
me.” 0 335 214
He 0 335 214
got 0 335 214
up, 0 335 214
went 0 335 214
out 0 335 214
of 0 335 214
the 0 335 214
room, 0 335 214
and 0 335 214
came 0 335 214
back 0 335 214
with 0 335 214
a 0 335 214
book. 0 335 214

“Here,” 0 335 215
he 0 335 215
said. 0 335 215

“Do 0 335 216
you 0 335 216
know 0 335 216
this 0 335 216
book? 0 335 216

You 0 335 217
should 0 335 217
read 0 335 217
it.” 0 335 217
It 0 335 217
was 0 335 217
Christopher 0 335 217
Ferrara's 0 335 217
The 0 335 217
Secret 0 335 217
Still 0 335 217
Hidden. 0 335 217

“Wait,” 0 335 218
I 0 335 218
said. 0 335 218

“You 1 335 219
are 1 335 219

US, 1 335 219
and 1 335 219
you 1 335 219
are 1 335 219
urging 1 335 219
me 1 335 219
to 1 335 219
read 1 335 219
a 1 335 219
book 1 335 219
that 1 335 219
questions 1 335 219
what 1 335 219
the 1 335 219
secretary 1 335 219
of 1 335 219
state 1 335 219
wrote?” 1 335 219
Sambi 0 335 219
replied, 0 335 219
“All 0 335 219
I 0 335 219
am 0 335 219
saying 0 335 219
is 0 335 219
that 0 335 219
there 0 335 219
are 0 335 219
interesting 0 335 219
things 0 335 219
worth 0 335 219
reading 0 335 219
in 0 335 219
this 0 335 219
book. 0 335 219

And 0 335 220
in 0 335 220
the 0 335 220
end, 0 335 220
we 0 335 220
are 0 335 220
all 0 335 220
after 0 335 220
the 0 335 220
truth, 0 335 220
aren’t 0 335 220
we? 0 335 220

The 0 335 221

is 0 335 221

indeed 0 335 222

And 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
truth 0 335 223
about 0 335 223
our 0 335 223
situation 0 335 223
is 0 335 223
revealed 0 335 223
in 0 335 223
that 0 335 223
still-hidden 0 335 223
part 0 335 223
of 0 335 223
the 0 335 223

whose 0 335 223
contents 0 335 223
Pope 0 335 223

pilgrimage 0 335 223
to 0 335 223
Fatima 0 335 223
in 0 335 223
2010, 0 335 223
identifying 0 335 223
elements 0 335 223
that 0 335 223
do 0 335 223
not 0 335 223
appear 0 335 223
at 0 335 223
all 0 335 223
in 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
obscure 0 335 223
vision 0 335 223
published 0 335 223
back 0 335 223
in 0 335 223
2000, 0 335 223
which 0 335 223
Sodano 0 335 223
and 0 335 223
Bertone 0 335 223
tried 0 335 223
to 0 335 223
pass 0 335 223
of 0 335 223
as 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
entirety 0 335 223
of 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
Secret 0 335 223
at 0 335 223
the 0 335 223
same 0 335 223
time 0 335 223
they 0 335 223
were 0 335 223
covering 0 335 223
up 0 335 223
homosexual 0 335 223
corruption 0 335 223
in 0 335 223
high 0 335 223
places: 0 335 223

As 0 335 224
for 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
new 0 335 224
things 0 335 224
which 0 335 224
we 0 335 224
can 0 335 224
find 0 335 224
in 0 335 224
this 0 335 224
message 0 335 224
today, 0 335 224
there 0 335 224
is 0 335 224
also 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
fact 0 335 224
that 0 335 224
attacks 0 335 224
on 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Pope 0 335 224
and 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Church 0 335 224
come 0 335 224
not 0 335 224
only 0 335 224
from 0 335 224
without, 0 335 224
but 0 335 224
the 1 335 224
sufferings 1 335 224
of 1 335 224
the 1 335 224
Church 1 335 224
come 0 335 224
precisely 0 335 224
from 0 335 224
within 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Church, 0 335 224
from 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
sin 0 335 224
existing 0 335 224
within 0 335 224
the 0 335 224
Church. 0 335 224

This 0 335 225
too 0 335 225
is 0 335 225
something 0 335 225
that 0 335 225
we 0 335 225
have 0 335 225
always 0 335 225
known, 0 335 225
but 0 335 225
today 0 335 225
we 0 335 225
are 0 335 225
seeing 0 335 225
it 0 335 225
in 0 335 225
a 1 335 225
really 1 335 225
terrifying 1 335 225
way: 1 335 225
that 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
greatest 0 335 225
persecution 0 335 225
of 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
Church 0 335 225
comes 0 335 225
not 0 335 225
from 0 335 225
her 0 335 225
enemies 0 335 225
without, 0 335 225
but 0 335 225
arises 0 335 225
from 0 335 225
sin 0 335 225
within 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
Church, 0 335 225
and 0 335 225
that 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
Church 0 335 225
thus 0 335 225
has 0 335 225
a 1 335 225
deep 1 335 225
need 1 335 225
to 1 335 225
relearn 1 335 225
penance, 1 335 225
to 1 335 225
accept 1 335 225
purification, 1 335 225
to 1 335 225
learn 1 335 225
forgiveness 1 335 225
on 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
one 0 335 225
hand, 0 335 225
but 0 335 225
also 0 335 225
the 0 335 225
need 0 335 225
for 0 335 225
justice. 0 335 225

[emphasis 0 335 226
added] 0 335 226

I 1 335 227
believe 1 335 227
that 1 335 227
Archbishop 1 335 227
Viganò’s 1 335 227
precious 1 335 227
testimony 1 335 227
is 1 335 227
a 1 335 227
sign 1 335 227
that 1 335 227
Heaven 1 335 227
itself 1 335 227
is 1 335 227
now 1 335 227
responding 1 335 227
to 1 335 227
the 1 335 227
“need 1 335 227
for 1 335 227
justice” 1 335 227
in 1 335 227
the 1 335 227
Church. 1 335 227

Whether 0 335 228
or 0 335 228
not 0 335 228
justice 0 335 228
involves 0 335 228
the 0 335 228
resignation 0 335 228
of 0 335 228
the 1 335 228
most 1 335 228
wayward 1 335 228
Pope 1 335 228
in 1 335 228
Church 1 335 228
history, 1 335 228
the 0 335 228
inevitable 0 335 228
season 0 335 228
of 0 335 228
justice 0 335 228
will 0 335 228
culminate 0 335 228
in 1 335 228
the 1 335 228
triumph 1 335 228
of 1 335 228
the 1 335 228
Immaculate 1 335 228
Heart 1 335 228
of 1 335 228
Mary 1 335 228
and 0 335 228
the 0 335 228
Church’s 0 335 228
restoration. 0 335 228

This 0 335 229
will 0 335 229
be 0 335 229
a 0 335 229
final 0 335 229
victory 0 335 229
over 0 335 229
the 0 335 229
enemies 0 335 229
within 0 335 229
and 0 335 229
their 0 335 229
apologists, 0 335 229
such 0 335 229
as 0 335 229
Faggioli, 0 335 229
who, 0 335 229
in 0 335 229
typical 0 335 229
neo-Catholic 0 335 229
style, 0 335 229
imperiously 1 335 229
scoffs 1 335 229
at 0 335 229
the 0 335 229
notion 0 335 229
of 0 335 229
“a 0 335 229
young 1 335 229
clergy 1 335 229
marked 1 335 229
by 1 335 229
personal 1 335 229
sanctity 1 335 229
but 1 335 229
also 1 335 229
by 1 335 229
a 1 335 229
fascination 1 335 229
for 1 335 229
a 1 335 229
mythical 1 335 229
Middle 1 335 229
Ages” 1 335 229

an 1 335 229
unsalvageable 1 335 229
mass 1 335 229
of 1 335 229
corruption 1 335 229
he 0 335 229
dares 0 335 229
to 0 335 229
describe 0 335 229
as 0 335 229
“a 0 335 229

on 1 335 229
a 1 335 229
principle 1 335 229
of 1 335 229
reality.” 1 335 229

It 0 343 45

anyway. 0 82 9

It 0 82 10
gets 0 82 10

excessively 0 82 12
at 0 82 12
these 0 82 12

she 0 82 13
was 0 82 13

she 0 82 13
states, 0 82 13

she 0 82 13

it. 0 82 13

In 0 82 14
response, 0 82 14
Kavanaugh 0 82 14
labeled 0 82 14
Swetnick's 0 82 14
salacious 0 82 14

Monday, 0 82 42

its 0 82 42
new 0 82 42

It 0 82 43

a 0 82 43
complement 0 82 43
of 0 82 43
nine 0 82 43
justices 0 82 43

with 0 82 43
Anthony 0 82 43
Kennedy’s 0 82 43
retirement 0 82 43

have 0 82 43
been 0 82 43
only 0 82 43
eight 0 82 43
justices. 0 82 43

Roughly 0 82 44
speaking 0 82 44
there 0 82 44

currently 0 82 47
controls 0 82 47
the 0 82 47

final 0 82 47

on 0 82 47
judicial 0 82 47
nominations, 0 82 47

uncomfortably 0 82 47
close 0 82 47
margin 0 82 47

The 0 82 48

Committee 0 82 49
Republicans 0 82 49
considered 0 82 49
the 0 82 49
political 0 82 49
optics 0 82 49
and 0 82 49
didn’t 0 82 49
relish 0 82 49
the 0 82 49
prospect 0 82 49
of 0 82 49
their 0 82 49
all-male 1 82 49
team 1 82 49
of 0 82 49
11 0 82 49
senators 0 82 49
questioning 0 82 49
a 0 82 49
woman 0 82 49
so 0 82 49
they 0 82 49
hired 0 82 49
sex-crimes 0 82 49
prosecutor 0 82 49
Rachel 0 82 49
Mitchell 0 82 49
of 0 82 49
Maricopa 0 82 49
County, 0 82 49
Arizona, 0 82 49
to 0 82 49
ask 0 82 49
the 0 82 49
questions 0 82 49
at 0 82 49
what 0 82 49
promises 0 82 49
to 0 82 49
be 0 82 49
a 0 82 49
highly-watched 0 82 49
hearing. 0 82 49

Democrats 0 82 50
predictably 0 82 50
freaked 1 82 50
out 1 82 50
at 0 82 50
the 0 82 50
decision 0 82 50
to 0 82 50
have 0 82 50
a 0 82 50
woman 0 82 50
lead 0 82 50
the 0 82 50
questioning 0 82 50
since 0 82 50
their 0 82 50
primary 0 82 50
objective 0 82 50
here 0 82 50
is 0 82 50
to 0 82 50
embarrass 0 82 50
and 0 82 50
discredit 0 82 50
Kavanaugh 0 82 50
and 0 82 50
other 0 82 50
Republicans, 0 82 50
not 0 82 50
get 0 82 50
at 0 82 50
the 0 82 50
truth. 0 82 50

“It 0 82 51
is 0 82 51
going 0 82 51
against 0 82 51
everything 0 82 51
I’ve 0 82 51
seen 0 82 51
for 0 82 51
44 0 82 51
years," 0 82 51
huffed 0 82 51
committee 0 82 51
member 0 82 51
Patrick 0 82 51
Leahy 0 82 51
(D-Vt.). 0 82 51

"They’re 0 82 52
not 0 82 52
following 0 82 52
normal 0 82 52
procedure." 0 82 52

As 0 82 53
expected, 0 82 53
at 0 82 53
today’s 0 82 53
hearing 0 82 53
Kavanaugh 0 82 53
will 0 82 53
firmly 0 82 53
rebut 0 82 53
the 0 82 53
increasingly 0 82 53
outrageous 0 82 53
claims 0 82 53
being 0 82 53
leveled 0 82 53
at 0 82 53
him. 0 82 53

According 0 82 54
to 0 82 54
prepared 0 82 54
testimony 0 82 54
provided 0 82 54
to 0 82 54
The 0 82 54
Hill 0 82 54
newspaper, 0 82 54
he 0 82 54
will 0 82 54
say: 0 82 54

I 0 82 55
categorically 1 82 55
and 1 82 55
unequivocally 1 82 55
deny 1 82 55
the 0 82 55
allegation 0 82 55
against 0 82 55
me 0 82 55
by 0 82 55
Dr. 0 82 55
Ford. 0 82 55

I 0 82 56
never 0 82 56
had 0 82 56
any 0 82 56
sexual 0 82 56
or 0 82 56
physical 0 82 56
encounter 0 82 56
of 0 82 56
any 0 82 56
kind 0 82 56
with 0 82 56
Dr. 0 82 56
Ford. 0 82 56

I 0 82 57
am 0 82 57
not 0 82 57
questioning 0 82 57
that 0 82 57
Dr. 0 82 57
Ford 0 82 57
may 0 82 57
have 0 82 57
been 0 82 57
sexually 0 82 57
assaulted 0 82 57
by 0 82 57
some 0 82 57
person 0 82 57
in 0 82 57
some 0 82 57
place 0 82 57
at 0 82 57
some 0 82 57
time. 0 82 57

But 0 82 58
I 0 82 58
have 0 82 58
never 0 82 58
done 0 82 58
that 0 82 58
to 0 82 58
her 0 82 58
or 0 82 58
to 0 82 58
anyone. 0 82 58

Kavanaugh 0 82 59
added: 0 82 59
"I 0 82 59
am 0 82 59
innocent 0 82 59
of 0 82 59
this 0 82 59
charge." 0 82 59

Not 0 82 60
surprisingly 0 82 60
Ford’s 0 82 60
prepared 0 82 60
testimony 0 82 60
also 0 82 60
found 0 82 60
its 0 82 60
way 0 82 60
to 0 82 60
reporters. 0 82 60

“I 0 82 61
am 0 82 61
here 0 82 61
today 0 82 61
not 0 82 61
because 0 82 61
I 0 82 61
want 0 82 61
to 0 82 61
be,” 0 82 61
Ford 0 82 61
says 0 82 61
in 0 82 61
her 0 82 61
opening 0 82 61
statement. 0 82 61

“I 0 82 62
am 1 82 62
terrified. 1 82 62

I 0 82 63
am 0 82 63
here 0 82 63
because 0 82 63
I 0 82 63
believe 0 82 63
it 0 82 63
is 0 82 63
my 0 82 63
civic 0 82 63
duty 0 82 63
to 0 82 63
tell 0 82 63
you 0 82 63
what 0 82 63
happened 0 82 63
to 0 82 63
me 0 82 63
while 0 82 63
Brett 0 82 63
Kavanaugh 0 82 63
and 0 82 63
I 0 82 63
were 0 82 63
in 0 82 63
high 0 82 63
school.” 0 82 63

She 0 82 64
describes 0 82 64
the 0 82 64
nominee 0 82 64
as 0 82 64
“Brett 1 82 64
Kavanaugh, 1 82 64
the 1 82 64
boy 1 82 64
who 1 82 64
sexually 1 82 64
assaulted 1 82 64
me,” 1 82 64
and 0 82 64
claims 0 82 64
“Brett’s 0 82 64
assault 0 82 64
on 0 82 64
me 0 82 64
drastically 1 82 64
altered 1 82 64
my 1 82 64
life,” 1 82 64
but 0 82 64
at 0 82 64
the 0 82 64
same 0 82 64
time 0 82 64
acknowledges 0 82 64
“Brett 0 82 64
did 0 82 64
not 0 82 64
rape 0 82 64
me.” 0 82 64

Given 0 82 65
that 0 82 65
Kavanaugh 0 82 65
has 0 82 65
already 0 82 65
passed 0 82 65
six 0 82 65
incredibly 0 82 65
intrusive 0 82 65
FBI 0 82 65
investigations, 0 82 65
odds 0 82 65
are 0 82 65
Ford 1 82 65
is 1 82 65
lying 1 82 65
or 1 82 65
suffering 1 82 65
from 1 82 65
some 1 82 65
kind 1 82 65
of 1 82 65
psychological 1 82 65
disorder 1 82 65
such 1 82 65
as 1 82 65
false 1 82 65
memory 1 82 65
syndrome. 1 82 65

Many 0 82 66
commentators 0 82 66
have 0 82 66
drawn 0 82 66
parallels 0 82 66
between 0 82 66
Ford 0 82 66
and 0 82 66
Anita 0 82 66
Hill, 0 82 66
who 0 82 66
in 0 82 66
1991 0 82 66
accused 0 82 66
then-Supreme 0 82 66
Court 0 82 66
nominee 0 82 66
Clarence 0 82 66
Thomas 0 82 66
of 0 82 66
sexual 0 82 66
improprieties. 0 82 66

Both 0 82 67
women 0 82 67
are 0 82 67
college 0 82 67
professors. 0 82 67

Both 0 82 68
claim 0 82 68
to 0 82 68
have 0 82 68

about 0 82 72

the 1 82 75

If 0 82 76
they 0 82 76
can 0 82 76
derail 0 82 76
Kavanaugh’s 0 82 76

The 0 82 80
case 0 82 80
against 0 82 80
confirming 0 82 80
Kavanaugh 0 82 80
may 0 82 80
be 0 82 80
somewhere 0 82 80
between 0 82 80
weak 0 82 80
and 0 82 80
non-existent, 0 82 80

the 0 82 80
constant 0 82 80

the 0 82 80

clearly 0 82 80
taking 0 82 80
its 0 82 80
toll 0 82 80
on 0 82 80
the 0 82 80
nominee. 0 82 80

That 0 82 81
said, 0 82 81
the 0 82 81
Senate 0 82 81
Judiciary 0 82 81

from 0 371 4
backing-away 0 371 4

all 0 371 4

digging 0 371 4
in 0 371 4
with 0 371 4
a 1 371 4
4-page 1 371 4
bombshell 1 371 4
that 0 371 4
restates 0 371 4

even 0 371 4
concludes 0 371 4
with 0 371 4
a 0 371 4
suggestion 0 371 4
that 0 371 4
Francis 0 371 4
is 0 371 4
beginning 0 371 4
to 0 371 4
act 0 371 4
as 0 371 4
a 1 371 4
“substitute 1 371 4
of 1 371 4

for 0 371 5
yourselves 0 371 5
and 0 371 5
note 0 371 5

the 0 371 5
ring 0 371 5

resonates 0 371 5
in 0 371 5
every 0 371 5
sentence. 0 371 5

This 1 371 6
is 1 371 6
clearly 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
testimony 1 371 6
of 1 371 6
an 1 371 6
honest 1 371 6
man 1 371 6
who 1 371 6
has 1 371 6
only 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
good 1 371 6
of 1 371 6
the 1 371 6
Church 1 371 6
in 1 371 6
his 1 371 6
heart—a 1 371 6
modern-day 1 371 6
Athanasius 1 371 6
standing 1 371 6
against 1 371 6
something 1 371 6
so 1 371 6
much 1 371 6
worse 1 371 6
than 1 371 6
Liberius. 1 371 6

let 0 371 7
us 0 371 7
pray 0 371 7
for 0 371 7
Archbishop 0 371 7
Viganò. 0 371 7

He 0 371 8
is 0 371 8
standing 0 371 8
alone 0 371 8
now, 0 371 8
and 0 371 8
not 0 371 8
only 0 371 8
against 0 371 8
the 1 371 8
most 1 371 8
dangerous 1 371 8
pontificate 1 371 8
in 1 371 8
history, 1 371 8
but 0 371 8
also 0 371 8
the 1 371 8
forces 1 371 8
of 1 371 8
hell 1 371 8
itself—forces 0 371 8
which 0 371 8
will 0 371 8
do 0 371 8
all 0 371 8
in 0 371 8
their 0 371 8
power 0 371 8
to 0 371 8
silence 0 371 8
this 0 371 8
voice 1 371 8
crying 1 371 8
in 1 371 8
the 1 371 8
wilderness. 1 371 8

Make 0 371 9
no 0 371 9
mistake 0 371 9
about 0 371 9
this: 0 371 9
Archbishop 1 371 9
Viganò 1 371 9
is 1 371 9
fighting 1 371 9
for 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
very 1 371 9
survival 1 371 9
of 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
human 1 371 9
element 1 371 9
of 1 371 9
the 1 371 9
Catholic 1 371 9
Church. 1 371 9

He 0 371 10
is 0 371 10
standing 0 371 10
against 0 371 10
corrupt 0 371 10
men 0 371 10
in 0 371 10
high 0 371 10
places 0 371 10
who 0 371 10
cannot 0 371 10
be 0 371 10
trusted 0 371 10
to 0 371 10
do 0 371 10
what 0 371 10
is 0 371 10
best 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
souls, 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
the 0 371 10
Catholic 0 371 10
faithful 0 371 10
or 0 371 10
indeed 0 371 10
for 0 371 10
Holy 0 371 10
Mother 0 371 10
Church 0 371 10
herself. 0 371 10

The 1 371 11
enemy 1 371 11
is 1 371 11
not 1 371 11
only 1 371 11
at 1 371 11
the 1 371 11
gates 1 371 11

It 0 371 13

the 1 371 13
sake 1 371 13

so 1 371 13
well. 1 371 13

It 0 371 33
has 0 371 33
been 0 371 33
a 0 371 33
month 0 371 33
since 0 371 33
I 0 371 33

was 0 371 33

in 0 371 33
the 0 371 33

most 1 371 34
painful 1 371 34
and 1 371 34
serious 1 371 34
decision 1 371 34
that 1 371 34
I 1 371 34
have 1 371 34
ever 1 371 34
made 1 371 34
in 1 371 34
my 1 371 34

I 0 371 35
made 0 371 35
it 0 371 35
after 0 371 35
long 0 371 35
reflection 0 371 35
and 0 371 35
prayer, 0 371 35
during 1 371 35
months 1 371 35
of 1 371 35
profound 1 371 35
suffering 1 371 35
and 1 371 35
anguish, 1 371 35
during 1 371 35
a 1 371 35
crescendo 1 371 35
of 1 371 35
continual 1 371 35
news 1 371 35
of 1 371 35
terrible 1 371 35
events, 1 371 35
with 1 371 35
thousands 1 371 35
of 1 371 35
innocent 1 371 35
victims 1 371 35
destroyed 1 371 35
and 1 371 35
the 1 371 35
vocations 1 371 35
and 1 371 35
lives 1 371 35
of 1 371 35
young 1 371 35

and 1 371 35
religious 1 371 35
disturbed. 1 371 35

The 0 371 36
silence 0 371 36
of 0 371 36
the 0 371 36
pastors 0 371 36
who 0 371 36
could 0 371 36
have 0 371 36
provided 0 371 36
a 0 371 36
remedy 0 371 36
and 0 371 36
prevented 0 371 36
new 0 371 36
victims 0 371 36
became 0 371 36
increasingly 0 371 36
indefensible, 0 371 36
a 1 371 36
devastating 1 371 36
crime 1 371 36
for 1 371 36
the 1 371 36
Church. 1 371 36

Well 0 371 37
aware 0 371 37
of 0 371 37
the 0 371 37
enormous 0 371 37
consequences 0 371 37
that 0 371 37
my 0 371 37
testimony 0 371 37
could 0 371 37
have, 0 371 37
because 0 371 37
what 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
was 0 371 37
about 0 371 37
to 0 371 37

involved 0 371 37

successor 0 371 37
of 0 371 37
Peter 0 371 37
himself, 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
nonetheless 0 371 37
chose 0 371 37
to 0 371 37
speak 0 371 37
in 0 371 37
order 0 371 37
to 0 371 37
protect 0 371 37
the 0 371 37
Church, 0 371 37
and 0 371 37
I 0 371 37
declare 0 371 37
with 0 371 37
a 0 371 37
clear 0 371 37
conscience 0 371 37
before 0 371 37
God 0 371 37
that 0 371 37
my 0 371 37
testimony 0 371 37
is 0 371 37
true. 0 371 37

Christ 0 371 38

Peter, 0 371 38
Servus 0 371 38
servorum 0 371 38
Dei, 0 371 38
is 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
first 0 371 38
one 0 371 38
called 0 371 38
to 0 371 38
serve 0 371 38
the 0 371 38
spouse 0 371 38
of 0 371 38
Christ. 0 371 38

Certainly, 0 371 39
some 0 371 39
of 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
facts 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
was 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
reveal 0 371 39
were 0 371 39
covered 0 371 39
by 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
pontifical 0 371 39
secret 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
had 0 371 39
promised 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
observe 0 371 39
and 0 371 39
that 0 371 39
I 0 371 39
had 0 371 39
faithfully 0 371 39
observed 0 371 39
from 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
beginning 0 371 39
of 0 371 39
my 0 371 39
service 0 371 39
to 0 371 39
the 0 371 39
Holy 0 371 39
See. 0 371 39

But 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
purpose 0 371 40
of 0 371 40
any 0 371 40
secret, 0 371 40
including 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
pontifical 0 371 40
secret, 0 371 40
is 0 371 40
to 0 371 40
protect 0 371 40
the 0 371 40
Church 0 371 40
from 0 371 40
her 0 371 40
enemies, 0 371 40
not 0 371 40
to 0 371 40
cover 0 371 40
up 0 371 40
and 0 371 40
become 0 371 40
complicit 0 371 40
in 0 371 40
crimes 0 371 40
committed 0 371 40
by 0 371 40
some 0 371 40
of 0 371 40
her 0 371 40
members. 0 371 40

I 0 371 41
was 0 371 41
a 0 371 41
witness, 0 371 41
not 0 371 41
by 0 371 41
my 0 371 41
choice, 0 371 41
of 0 371 41
shocking 1 371 41
facts 1 371 41
and, 0 371 41
as 0 371 41
the 0 371 41
Catechism 0 371 41
of 0 371 41
the 0 371 41
Catholic 0 371 41
Church 0 371 41
states 0 371 41
(par. 0 371 41

2491), 0 371 42
the 0 371 42
seal 0 371 42
of 0 371 42
secrecy 0 371 42
is 0 371 42
not 0 371 42
binding 0 371 42
when 0 371 42
very 0 371 42
grave 0 371 42
harm 0 371 42
can 0 371 42
be 0 371 42
avoided 0 371 42
only 0 371 42
by 0 371 42
divulging 0 371 42
the 0 371 42
truth. 0 371 42

Only 0 371 43
the 0 371 43
seal 0 371 43
of 0 371 43
confession 0 371 43
could 0 371 43
have 0 371 43
justified 0 371 43
my 0 371 43
silence. 0 371 43

Neither 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
pope, 0 371 44
nor 0 371 44
any 0 371 44
of 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
cardinals 0 371 44
in 0 371 44
Rome 0 371 44
have 0 371 44
denied 0 371 44
the 0 371 44
facts 0 371 44
I 0 371 44
asserted 0 371 44
in 0 371 44
my 0 371 44
testimony. 0 371 44

“Qui 0 371 45
tacet 0 371 45
consentit” 0 371 45
surely 0 371 45
applies 0 371 45
here, 0 371 45
for 0 371 45
if 0 371 45
they 0 371 45
deny 0 371 45
my 0 371 45
testimony, 0 371 45
they 0 371 45
have 0 371 45
only 0 371 45
to 0 371 45
say 0 371 45
so, 0 371 45
and 0 371 45
provide 0 371 45
documentation 0 371 45
to 0 371 45
support 0 371 45
that 0 371 45
denial. 0 371 45

How 1 371 46
can 1 371 46
one 1 371 46
avoid 1 371 46
concluding 1 371 46
that 1 371 46
the 1 371 46
reason 1 371 46
they 1 371 46
do 1 371 46
not 1 371 46
provide 1 371 46
the 1 371 46
documentation 1 371 46
is 1 371 46
that 1 371 46
they 1 371 46
know 1 371 46
it 1 371 46
confirms 1 371 46
my 1 371 46
testimony? 1 371 46

The 0 371 47
center 0 371 47
of 0 371 47
my 0 371 47
testimony 0 371 47
was 0 371 47
that 0 371 47
since 0 371 47
at 0 371 47
least 0 371 47
June 0 371 47
23, 0 371 47
2013, 0 371 47
the 0 371 47
pope 0 371 47
knew 0 371 47
from 0 371 47
me 0 371 47
how 1 371 47
perverse 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
evil 1 371 47
McCarrick 0 371 47
was 0 371 47
in 0 371 47
his 0 371 47
intentions 0 371 47
and 0 371 47
actions, 0 371 47
and 0 371 47
instead 1 371 47
of 1 371 47
taking 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
measures 1 371 47
that 1 371 47
every 1 371 47
good 1 371 47
pastor 1 371 47
would 1 371 47
have 1 371 47
taken, 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
pope 1 371 47
made 1 371 47
McCarrick 1 371 47
one 1 371 47
of 1 371 47
his 1 371 47
principal 1 371 47
agents 1 371 47
in 1 371 47
governing 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
Church, 1 371 47
in 1 371 47
regard 1 371 47
to 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
United 1 371 47
States, 1 371 47
the 1 371 47
Curia, 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
even 1 371 47
China, 1 371 47
as 1 371 47
we 1 371 47
are 1 371 47
seeing 1 371 47
these 1 371 47
days 1 371 47
with 1 371 47
great 1 371 47
concern 1 371 47
and 1 371 47
anxiety 1 371 47
for 1 371 47
that 1 371 47
martyr 1 371 47
Church. 1 371 47

Now, 1 371 48
the 1 371 48
pope’s 1 371 48
reply 1 371 48
to 1 371 48
my 1 371 48
testimony 1 371 48
was: 1 371 48
“I 1 371 48
will 1 371 48
not 1 371 48
say 1 371 48
a 1 371 48
word!” 1 371 48
But 1 371 48
then, 1 371 48
contradicting 1 371 48
himself, 1 371 48
he 1 371 48
has 1 371 48
compared 1 371 48
his 1 371 48
silence 1 371 48
to 1 371 48
that 1 371 48
of 1 371 48
Jesus 1 371 48
in 1 371 48
Nazareth 1 371 48
and 1 371 48
before 1 371 48
Pilate, 1 371 48
and 0 371 48
compared 0 371 48
me 0 371 48
to 0 371 48
the 1 371 48
great 1 371 48
accuser, 1 371 48
Satan, 1 371 48
who 1 371 48
sows 1 371 48
scandal 1 371 48
and 1 371 48
division 1 371 48
in 1 371 48
the 1 371 48
Church 1 371 48
— 0 371 48
though 0 371 48
without 0 371 48
ever 0 371 48
uttering 0 371 48
my 0 371 48
name. 0 371 48

If 0 371 49
he 0 371 49
had 0 371 49
said: 0 371 49
“Viganò 0 371 49
lied,” 0 371 49
he 0 371 49
would 0 371 49
have 0 371 49
challenged 0 371 49
my 0 371 49
credibility 0 371 49
while 0 371 49
trying 0 371 49
to 0 371 49
affirm 0 371 49
his 0 371 49
own. 0 371 49

In 0 371 50
so 0 371 50
doing 0 371 50
he 0 371 50
would 0 371 50
have 0 371 50
intensified 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
demand 0 371 50
of 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
people 0 371 50
of 0 371 50
God 0 371 50
and 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
world 0 371 50
for 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
documentation 0 371 50
needed 0 371 50
to 0 371 50
determine 0 371 50
who 0 371 50
has 0 371 50
told 0 371 50
the 0 371 50
truth. 0 371 50

Instead, 0 371 51
he 0 371 51
put 0 371 51
in 0 371 51
place 0 371 51
a 0 371 51
subtle 0 371 51
slander 0 371 51
against 0 371 51
me 0 371 51
— 0 371 51
slander 0 371 51
being 0 371 51
an 0 371 51
offense 0 371 51
he 0 371 51
has 0 371 51
often 0 371 51
compared 0 371 51
to 0 371 51
the 0 371 51
gravity 0 371 51
of 0 371 51
murder. 0 371 51

Indeed, 0 371 52
he 0 371 52
did 0 371 52
it 0 371 52
repeatedly, 0 371 52
in 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
context 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
celebration 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
most 0 371 52
Holy 0 371 52
Sacrament, 0 371 52
the 0 371 52
Eucharist, 0 371 52
where 0 371 52
he 0 371 52
runs 0 371 52
no 0 371 52
risk 0 371 52
of 0 371 52
being 0 371 52
challenged 0 371 52
by 0 371 52
journalists. 0 371 52

When 0 371 53
he 0 371 53
did 0 371 53
speak 0 371 53
to 0 371 53
journalists, 0 371 53
he 0 371 53
asked 0 371 53
them 0 371 53
to 0 371 53
exercise 0 371 53
their 0 371 53
professional 0 371 53
maturity 0 371 53
and 0 371 53
draw 0 371 53
their 0 371 53
own 0 371 53
conclusions. 0 371 53

But 1 371 54
how 1 371 54
can 1 371 54
journalists 1 371 54
discover 1 371 54
and 1 371 54
know 1 371 54
the 1 371 54
truth 1 371 54
if 1 371 54
those 1 371 54
directly 1 371 54
involved 1 371 54
with 1 371 54
a 1 371 54
matter 1 371 54
refuse 1 371 54
to 1 371 54
answer 1 371 54
any 1 371 54
questions 1 371 54
or 1 371 54
to 1 371 54
release 1 371 54
any 1 371 54
documents? 1 371 54

The 1 371 55
pope’s 1 371 55
unwillingness 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
respond 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
my 1 371 55
charges 1 371 55
and 1 371 55
his 1 371 55
deafness 1 371 55
to 1 371 55
the 1 371 55
appeals 1 371 55
by 1 371 55
the 1 371 55
faithful 1 371 55
for 1 371 55
accountability 1 371 55
are 1 371 55
hardly 1 371 55
consistent 1 371 55
with 1 371 55
his 1 371 55
calls 1 371 55
for 1 371 55
transparency 1 371 55
and 1 371 55
bridge 1 371 55
building. 1 371 55

Moreover, 0 371 56
the 0 371 56
pope’s 0 371 56
cover-up 0 371 56
of 0 371 56
McCarrick 0 371 56
was 0 371 56
clearly 0 371 56
not 0 371 56
an 0 371 56
isolated 0 371 56
mistake. 0 371 56

Many 1 371 57
more 1 371 57
instances 1 371 57
have 1 371 57
recently 1 371 57
been 1 371 57
documented 1 371 57
in 1 371 57
the 1 371 57
press, 1 371 57
showing 1 371 57
that 1 371 57
Pope 1 371 57
Francis 1 371 57
has 1 371 57
defended 1 371 57
homosexual 1 371 57
clergy 1 371 57
who 1 371 57
committed 1 371 57
serious 1 371 57
sexual 1 371 57
abuses 1 371 57
against 1 371 57
minors 1 371 57
or 1 371 57
adults. 1 371 57

These 0 371 58
include 0 371 58
his 0 371 58
role 0 371 58
in 0 371 58
the 0 371 58
case 0 371 58
of 0 371 58
Fr. 0 371 58

Julio 0 371 59
Grassi 0 371 59
in 0 371 59
Buenos 0 371 59
Aires, 0 371 59
his 0 371 59
reinstatement 0 371 59
of 0 371 59
Fr. 0 371 59

Mauro 0 371 60
Inzoli 0 371 60
after 0 371 60
Pope 0 371 60
Benedict 0 371 60
had 0 371 60
removed 0 371 60
him 0 371 60
from 0 371 60
ministry 0 371 60
(until 0 371 60
he 0 371 60
went 0 371 60
to 0 371 60
prison, 0 371 60
at 0 371 60
which 0 371 60
point 0 371 60
Pope 0 371 60
Francis 0 371 60
laicized 0 371 60
him), 0 371 60
and 0 371 60
his 0 371 60
halting 0 371 60
of 0 371 60
the 0 371 60
investigation 0 371 60
of 0 371 60
sex 0 371 60
abuse 0 371 60
allegations 0 371 60
against 0 371 60
Cardinal 0 371 60
Cormac 0 371 60
Murphy 0 371 60
O’Connor. 0 371 60

In 0 371 61
the 0 371 61
meantime, 0 371 61
a 0 371 61
delegation 0 371 61
of 0 371 61
the 0 371 61
USCCB, 0 371 61
headed 0 371 61
by 0 371 61
its 0 371 61
president 0 371 61
Cardinal 0 371 61
DiNardo, 0 371 61
went 0 371 61
to 0 371 61
Rome 0 371 61
asking 0 371 61
for 0 371 61
a 0 371 61
Vatican 0 371 61
investigation 0 371 61
into 0 371 61
McCarrick. 0 371 61

Cardinal 0 371 62
DiNardo 0 371 62
and 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
other 0 371 62
prelates 0 371 62
should 0 371 62
tell 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
Church 0 371 62
in 0 371 62
America 0 371 62
and 0 371 62
in 0 371 62
the 0 371 62
world: 0 371 62
did 1 371 62
the 1 371 62
pope 1 371 62
refuse 1 371 62
to 1 371 62
carry 1 371 62
out 1 371 62
a 1 371 62
Vatican 1 371 62
investigation 1 371 62
into 1 371 62
McCarrick’s 1 371 62
crimes 1 371 62
and 1 371 62
of 1 371 62
those 1 371 62
responsible 1 371 62
for 1 371 62
covering 1 371 62
them 1 371 62
up? 1 371 62

The 1 371 63
faithful 1 371 63
deserve 1 371 63
to 1 371 63
know. 1 371 63

I 0 371 64
would 0 371 64
like 0 371 64
to 0 371 64
make 0 371 64
a 0 371 64
special 0 371 64
appeal 0 371 64
to 0 371 64
Cardinal 0 371 64
Ouellet, 0 371 64
because 0 371 64
as 0 371 64
nuncio 0 371 64
I 0 371 64
always 0 371 64
worked 0 371 64
in 0 371 64
great 0 371 64
harmony 0 371 64
with 0 371 64
him, 0 371 64
and 0 371 64
I 0 371 64
have 0 371 64
always 0 371 64
had 0 371 64
great 0 371 64
esteem 0 371 64
and 0 371 64
affection 0 371 64
towards 0 371 64
him. 0 371 64

He 0 371 65
will 0 371 65
remember 0 371 65
when, 0 371 65
at 0 371 65
the 0 371 65
end 0 371 65
of 0 371 65
my 0 371 65
mission 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
Washington, 0 371 65
he 0 371 65
received 0 371 65
me 0 371 65
at 0 371 65
his 0 371 65
apartment 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
Rome 0 371 65
in 0 371 65
the 0 371 65
evening 0 371 65
for 0 371 65
a 0 371 65
long 0 371 65
conversation. 0 371 65

At 0 371 66
the 0 371 66
beginning 0 371 66
of 0 371 66
Pope 0 371 66
Francis’ 0 371 66
pontificate, 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
had 0 371 66
maintained 0 371 66
his 0 371 66
dignity, 0 371 66
as 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
had 0 371 66
shown 0 371 66
with 0 371 66
courage 0 371 66
when 0 371 66
he 0 371 66
was 0 371 66
Archbishop 0 371 66
of 0 371 66
Québec. 0 371 66

Later, 0 371 67
however, 0 371 67
when 0 371 67
his 0 371 67
work 0 371 67
as 0 371 67
prefect 0 371 67
of 0 371 67
the 0 371 67
Congregation 0 371 67
for 0 371 67
Bishops 0 371 67
was 0 371 67
being 0 371 67
undermined 0 371 67
because 0 371 67
recommendations 0 371 67
for 0 371 67
episcopal 0 371 67
appointments 0 371 67
were 0 371 67
being 0 371 67
passed 0 371 67
directly 0 371 67
to 0 371 67
Pope 0 371 67
Francis 0 371 67
by 0 371 67
two 1 371 67
homosexual 1 371 67
“friends” 1 371 67
of 1 371 67
his 1 371 67
dicastery, 1 371 67
bypassing 0 371 67
the 0 371 67
Cardinal, 0 371 67
he 0 371 67
gave 0 371 67
up. 0 371 67

His 1 371 68
long 1 371 68
article 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
L’Osservatore 1 371 68
Romano, 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
which 1 371 68
he 1 371 68
came 1 371 68
out 1 371 68
in 1 371 68
favor 1 371 68
of 1 371 68
the 1 371 68
more 1 371 68
controversial 1 371 68
aspects 1 371 68
of 1 371 68
Amoris 1 371 68
Laetitia, 1 371 68
represents 1 371 68
his 1 371 68
surrender. 1 371 68

Your 0 371 69
Eminence, 0 371 69
before 0 371 69
I 0 371 69
left 0 371 69
for 0 371 69
Washington, 0 371 69
you 0 371 69
were 0 371 69
the 0 371 69
one 0 371 69
who 0 371 69
told 0 371 69
me 0 371 69
of 0 371 69
Pope 0 371 69
Benedict’s 0 371 69
sanctions 0 371 69
on 0 371 69
McCarrick. 0 371 69

You 0 371 70
have 0 371 70
at 0 371 70
your 0 371 70
complete 0 371 70
disposal 0 371 70
key 0 371 70
documents 0 371 70
incriminating 0 371 70
McCarrick 0 371 70
and 0 371 70
many 0 371 70
in 0 371 70
the 0 371 70
curia 0 371 70
for 0 371 70
their 0 371 70
cover-ups. 0 371 70

Your 0 371 71

“This 0 374 28

the 0 374 32

Ellison 0 374 32
will 0 374 32
be 0 374 32
finished 0 374 32

then 0 374 32
released 0 374 32

An 0 374 33

The 0 374 34
Star 0 374 34
Tribune 0 374 34
argued 0 374 34
that, 0 374 34

the 0 374 34

Divorce 0 374 35
records 0 374 35
are 0 374 35
typically 0 374 35
public, 0 374 35
but 0 374 35
judges 0 374 35
will 0 374 35
often 0 374 35
agree 0 374 35
to 0 374 35
seal 0 374 35
them 0 374 35
if 0 374 35
both 0 374 35

and 0 374 35
no 0 374 35
one 0 374 35
else 0 374 35
objects. 0 374 35

The 0 374 36
Ellison 0 374 36
campaign 0 374 36
released 0 374 36
a 0 374 36
statement 0 374 36
from 0 374 36
Kim 0 374 36
Ellison 0 374 36
on 0 374 36

of 0 374 36
both 0 374 36
her 0 374 36
and 0 374 36
Keith 0 374 36
Ellison. 0 374 36

“Our 0 374 37

and 0 374 37
therefore, 0 374 37
when 0 374 37
we 0 374 37

we 0 374 37

testified 0 376 10
separately 0 376 10
after 0 376 10
Ford’s 0 376 10
testimony 0 376 10
concluded. 0 376 10

Kavanaugh 1 376 11
stole 1 376 11
the 1 376 11
show. 1 376 11

The 0 376 12
judge 0 376 12
forcefully 0 376 12
stood 0 376 12
up 0 376 12
for 0 376 12
himself 0 376 12
as 0 376 12
his 0 376 12
voice 0 376 12
trembled 1 376 12
with 1 376 12
righteous 1 376 12
indignation, 1 376 12
calling 0 376 12
out 0 376 12
Democratic 0 376 12
senators 0 376 12
for 0 376 12
plotting 0 376 12
against 0 376 12
him. 0 376 12

The 0 376 13
behavior 0 376 13
of 0 376 13
several 0 376 13
of 0 376 13
the 0 376 13
Democratic 0 376 13
members 0 376 13
of 0 376 13
this 0 376 13
committee 0 376 13
at 0 376 13
my 0 376 13
hearing 0 376 13
a 0 376 13
few 0 376 13
weeks 0 376 13
ago 0 376 13
was 0 376 13
an 0 376 13
embarrassment. 0 376 13

But 0 376 14
at 0 376 14
least 0 376 14
it 0 376 14
was 0 376 14
just 0 376 14
a 0 376 14
good 0 376 14
old-fashioned 0 376 14
attempt 0 376 14
at 0 376 14
Borking. 0 376 14

Those 0 376 15
efforts 0 376 15
didn't 0 376 15
work. 0 376 15

When 0 376 16
I 0 376 16
did 0 376 16
at 0 376 16
least 0 376 16
okay 0 376 16
enough 0 376 16
at 0 376 16
the 0 376 16
hearings 0 376 16
that 0 376 16
it 0 376 16
looked 0 376 16
like 0 376 16
I 0 376 16
might 0 376 16
actually 0 376 16
get 0 376 16
confirmed, 0 376 16
a 0 376 16
new 0 376 16
tactic 0 376 16
was 0 376 16
needed. 0 376 16

Some 0 376 17
of 0 376 17
you 0 376 17
were 0 376 17
lying 0 376 17
in 0 376 17
wait 0 376 17
and 0 376 17
had 0 376 17
it 0 376 17
ready. 0 376 17

This 0 376 18
first 0 376 18
allegation 0 376 18
was 0 376 18
held 0 376 18
in 0 376 18
secret 0 376 18
for 0 376 18
weeks 0 376 18
by 0 376 18
a 0 376 18
Democratic 0 376 18
member 0 376 18
of 0 376 18
this 0 376 18
committee, 0 376 18
and 0 376 18
by 0 376 18
staff. 0 376 18

It 0 376 19
would 0 376 19
be 0 376 19
needed 0 376 19
only 0 376 19
if 0 376 19
you 0 376 19
couldn't 0 376 19
take 0 376 19
me 0 376 19
out 0 376 19
on 0 376 19
the 0 376 19
merits. 0 376 19

When 0 376 20
it 0 376 20
was 0 376 20
needed, 0 376 20
this 0 376 20
allegation 0 376 20
was 0 376 20
unleashed 0 376 20
and 0 376 20
publicly 0 376 20
deployed 0 376 20
over 0 376 20
Dr. 0 376 20
Ford's 0 376 20
wishes. 0 376 20

And 0 376 21
then, 0 376 21
and 1 376 21
then 1 376 21
as 0 376 21
no 0 376 21
doubt 0 376 21
was 0 376 21
expected, 0 376 21
if 0 376 21
not 0 376 21
planned, 0 376 21
came 0 376 21
a 0 376 21
long 0 376 21
series 0 376 21
of 0 376 21
false 0 376 21
last-minute 1 376 21
smears 1 376 21
designed 0 376 21
to 0 376 21
scare 0 376 21
me 0 376 21
and 0 376 21
drive 0 376 21
me 0 376 21
out 0 376 21
of 0 376 21
the 0 376 21
process 0 376 21
before 0 376 21
any 0 376 21
hearing 0 376 21
occurred. 0 376 21

Afraid 1 376 22
of 1 376 22
their 1 376 22
own 1 376 22
shadows, 1 376 22
committee 0 376 22
Republicans 0 376 22
didn’t 0 376 22
relish 0 376 22
the 0 376 22
prospect 0 376 22
of 0 376 22
their 0 376 22
all-male 1 376 22
team 1 376 22
of 0 376 22
11 0 376 22
senators 0 376 22
questioning 0 376 22
a 0 376 22
woman 0 376 22
so 0 376 22
they 0 376 22
hired 0 376 22
sex-crimes 0 376 22
prosecutor 0 376 22
Rachel 0 376 22
Mitchell 0 376 22
of 0 376 22
Maricopa 0 376 22
County, 0 376 22
Arizona, 0 376 22
to 0 376 22
examine 0 376 22
Ford. 0 376 22

Opinions 0 376 23
differ 0 376 23
widely 0 376 23
on 0 376 23
how 0 376 23
Mitchell 0 376 23
performed. 0 376 23

She 0 376 24
tiptoed 0 376 24
around 0 376 24
the 0 376 24
alleged 0 376 24
sexual 0 376 24
assault 0 376 24
itself, 0 376 24
instead 0 376 24
focusing 0 376 24
on 0 376 24
process-related 0 376 24
questions, 0 376 24
presumably 0 376 24
in 0 376 24
an 0 376 24
effort 0 376 24
to 0 376 24
show 0 376 24
undecided 0 376 24
senators 0 376 24
how 0 376 24
Ford 0 376 24
and 0 376 24
her 0 376 24
handlers 0 376 24
have 0 376 24
been 0 376 24
unfairly 0 376 24
manipulating 0 376 24
the 0 376 24
process. 0 376 24

In 0 376 25
much 0 376 25
of 0 376 25
her 0 376 25
testimony, 0 376 25
Ford 0 376 25
came 0 376 25
across 0 376 25
as 0 376 25
presentable 0 376 25
and 0 376 25
seemingly 0 376 25
credible, 0 376 25
though 0 376 25
vague 0 376 25
and 0 376 25
sometimes 0 376 25
evasive, 0 376 25
her 0 376 25
ridiculous 1 376 25
overall 1 376 25
story 1 376 25
notwithstanding. 0 376 25

Ford 0 376 26
did 0 376 26
well 0 376 26
enough 0 376 26
that 0 376 26
during 0 376 26
the 0 376 26
break 0 376 26
between 0 376 26
her 0 376 26
testimony 0 376 26
and 0 376 26
Kavanaugh’s, 0 376 26
commentators 0 376 26
on 0 376 26
Fox 0 376 26
News 0 376 26
such 0 376 26
as 0 376 26
Brit 0 376 26
Hume 0 376 26
and 0 376 26
Andrew 0 376 26
Napolitano 0 376 26
were 0 376 26
openly 0 376 26
musing 0 376 26
about 0 376 26
the 0 376 26
nominee 0 376 26
withdrawing, 0 376 26
opinions 0 376 26
that 0 376 26
were 0 376 26
sharply 0 376 26
reversed 0 376 26
after 0 376 26
the 0 376 26
nominee 0 376 26
completed 0 376 26
his 0 376 26
testimony 0 376 26
hours 0 376 26
later. 0 376 26

It’s 0 376 27
not 0 376 27
that 0 376 27
Mitchell 0 376 27
did 0 376 27
a 0 376 27
bad 0 376 27
job 0 376 27
creating 0 376 27
an 0 376 27
inventory 0 376 27
of 0 376 27
the 0 376 27
irregularities 0 376 27
in 0 376 27
the 0 376 27
process 0 376 27
and 0 376 27
of 0 376 27
the 0 376 27
odd 0 376 27
behavior 0 376 27
of 0 376 27
Ford 0 376 27
and 0 376 27
her 0 376 27
lawyers. 0 376 27

She 0 376 28
could 0 376 28
do 0 376 28
little 0 376 28
else. 0 376 28

She 0 376 29
had 0 376 29
many 0 376 29
restrictions 0 376 29
placed 0 376 29
upon 0 376 29
her 0 376 29
and 0 376 29
was 0 376 29
only 0 376 29
allowed 0 376 29
to 0 376 29
question 0 376 29
Ford 0 376 29
for 0 376 29
minutes 0 376 29
at 0 376 29
a 0 376 29
time 0 376 29
before 0 376 29
surrendering 0 376 29
the 0 376 29
floor 0 376 29
to 0 376 29
the 0 376 29
next 0 376 29
committee 0 376 29
Democrat. 0 376 29

As 0 376 30
commentator 0 376 30
Sean 0 376 30
Davis 0 376 30
tweeted: 0 376 30

“Hard 1 376 31
to 1 376 31
do 1 376 31
much 1 376 31
else 1 376 31
when 1 376 31
the 1 376 31
witness 1 376 31
conveniently 1 376 31
has 1 376 31
no 1 376 31
corroborating 1 376 31
evidence, 1 376 31
no 1 376 31
memory 1 376 31
of 1 376 31
any 1 376 31
verifiable 1 376 31
facts 1 376 31
of 1 376 31
what 1 376 31
happened, 1 376 31
and 1 376 31
everyone 1 376 31
she 1 376 31
says 1 376 31
was 1 376 31
present 1 376 31
at 1 376 31
the 1 376 31
alleged 1 376 31
incident--even 1 376 31
her 1 376 31
best 1 376 31
friend--has 1 376 31
denied 1 376 31
it.” 1 376 31

Nonetheless, 0 376 32
Mitchell’s 0 376 32
questioning 0 376 32
came 0 376 32
across 0 376 32
at 0 376 32
times 0 376 32
as 0 376 32
perfunctory, 0 376 32
leading 0 376 32
many 0 376 32
observers 0 376 32
to 0 376 32
conclude 0 376 32
that 0 376 32
Republicans 0 376 32
threw 0 376 32
away 0 376 32
a 0 376 32
valuable 0 376 32
opportunity 0 376 32
by 0 376 32
using 0 376 32
her 0 376 32
as 0 376 32
a 0 376 32
stand-in. 0 376 32

She 0 376 33
failed 0 376 33
to 0 376 33
lay 0 376 33
a 0 376 33
glove 0 376 33
on 0 376 33
a 0 376 33
witness 0 376 33
whose 0 376 33
implausible, 0 376 33
internally 0 376 33
contradictory 0 376 33
story 0 376 33
cried 1 376 33
out 1 376 33
for 1 376 33
vigorous 1 376 33
cross-examination. 1 376 33

In 0 376 34
the 0 376 34
end 0 376 34
the 0 376 34
too-deferential, 0 376 34
easygoing 0 376 34
Mitchell 0 376 34
failed 0 376 34
to 0 376 34
provide 0 376 34
much, 0 376 34
if 0 376 34
anything, 0 376 34
in 0 376 34
the 0 376 34
way 0 376 34
of 0 376 34
evidence 0 376 34
against 0 376 34
Ford 0 376 34
or 0 376 34
in 0 376 34
favor 0 376 34
of 0 376 34
Kavanaugh. 0 376 34

Whether 0 376 35
her 0 376 35
work 0 376 35
will 0 376 35
bring 0 376 35
over 0 376 35
fence-sitting 0 376 35
senators 0 376 35
to 0 376 35
Kavanaugh’s 0 376 35
side 0 376 35
remains 0 376 35
to 0 376 35
be 0 376 35
seen. 0 376 35

Like 0 376 36
other 0 376 36
Democrats, 0 376 36
Sen. 0 376 36
Mazie 0 376 36
Hirono 0 376 36
of 0 376 36
Hawaii 0 376 36
tried 0 376 36
to 0 376 36
help 0 376 36
Ford, 0 376 36
lobbing 1 376 36
her 1 376 36
softballs. 1 376 36

After 0 376 37
saying 0 376 37
she 0 376 37
thought 0 376 37
she 0 376 37
knew 0 376 37
what 0 376 37
Mitchell 0 376 37
was 0 376 37
trying 0 376 37
to 0 376 37
get 0 376 37
at 0 376 37
in 0 376 37
her 0 376 37
questions, 0 376 37
the 0 376 37
senator 0 376 37
said, 0 376 37
“so 0 376 37
I'll 0 376 37
just 0 376 37
ask 0 376 37
you 0 376 37
very 0 376 37
plainly, 0 376 37
Dr. 0 376 37
Ford, 0 376 37
is 1 376 37
there 1 376 37
a 1 376 37
political 1 376 37
motivation 1 376 37
for 1 376 37
your 1 376 37
coming 1 376 37
forward 1 376 37
with 1 376 37
your 1 376 37
account 1 376 37
of 1 376 37
the 1 376 37
assault 1 376 37
by 1 376 37
Brett 1 376 37
Kavanaugh?” 1 376 37

“No, 0 376 38
and 0 376 38
I'd 0 376 38
like 0 376 38
to 0 376 38
reiterate 0 376 38
that 0 376 38
again, 0 376 38
I 0 376 38
was 0 376 38
trying 0 376 38
to 0 376 38
get 0 376 38
the 0 376 38
information 0 376 38
to 0 376 38
you 0 376 38
while 0 376 38
there 0 376 38
was 0 376 38
still 0 376 38
a 0 376 38
list 0 376 38
of 0 376 38
other 0 376 38
what 0 376 38
looked 0 376 38
like 0 376 38
equally-qualified 0 376 38
candidates,” 0 376 38
Ford 0 376 38
replied. 0 376 38

When 0 376 39
Sen. 0 376 39
Dick 0 376 39
Durbin 0 376 39
(D-Ill.) 0 376 39
asked 0 376 39
Ford 0 376 39
“with 0 376 39
what 0 376 39
degree 0 376 39
of 0 376 39
certainty 0 376 39
do 0 376 39
you 0 376 39
believe 0 376 39
Brett 0 376 39
Kavanaugh 0 376 39
assaulted 0 376 39
you?” 0 376 39
Ford 0 376 39
replied, 0 376 39
“one 0 376 39
hundred 0 376 39
percent.” 0 376 39

Strangely, 0 376 40
Ford 1 376 40
has 1 376 40
a 1 376 40
bad 1 376 40
long-term 1 376 40
memory 1 376 40
and 1 376 40
a 1 376 40
bad 1 376 40
short-term 1 376 40
memory. 1 376 40

She 0 376 41
doesn’t 0 376 41
know 0 376 41
when 0 376 41
or 0 376 41
where 0 376 41
the 0 376 41
alleged 0 376 41
incident 0 376 41
took 0 376 41
place, 0 376 41
yet 0 376 41
she 0 376 41
is 0 376 41
“one 0 376 41
hundred 0 376 41
percent” 0 376 41
certain 0 376 41
it 0 376 41
was 0 376 41
Kavanaugh 0 376 41
who 0 376 41
attacked 0 376 41
her. 0 376 41

At 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
outset 0 376 42
of 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
hearing, 0 376 42
Grassley 0 376 42
provided 0 376 42
an 0 376 42
overview 0 376 42
of 0 376 42
what 0 376 42
Kavanaugh 0 376 42
had 0 376 42
gone 0 376 42
through 0 376 42
–including 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
Democrats’ 0 376 42
sordid 0 376 42
behavior— 0 376 42
since 0 376 42
President 0 376 42
Trump 0 376 42
announced 0 376 42
the 0 376 42
judge’s 0 376 42
nomination 0 376 42
on 0 376 42
July 0 376 42
9. 0 376 42

As 0 376 43
part 0 376 43
of 0 376 43
the 0 376 43
confirmation 0 376 43
process, 0 376 43
Kavanaugh 0 376 43
endured 0 376 43
his 0 376 43
sixth 0 376 43
background 0 376 43
investigation 0 376 43
since 0 376 43
1993. 0 376 43

“Nowhere 0 376 44
in 0 376 44
any 0 376 44
of 0 376 44
these 0 376 44
six 0 376 44
FBI 0 376 44
reports, 0 376 44
which 0 376 44
committee 0 376 44
investigators 0 376 44
have 0 376 44
reviewed 0 376 44
on 0 376 44
a 0 376 44
bipartisan 0 376 44
basis, 0 376 44
was 0 376 44
there 0 376 44
a 0 376 44
whiff 0 376 44
of 0 376 44
any 0 376 44
issue 0 376 44
– 0 376 44
any 1 376 44
issue 1 376 44
at 0 376 44
all 0 376 44
related 0 376 44
in 0 376 44
any 0 376 44
way 0 376 44
to 0 376 44
inappropriate 0 376 44
sexual 0 376 44
behavior,” 0 376 44
Grassley 0 376 44
said. 0 376 44

Ford 0 376 45
shared 0 376 45
her 0 376 45
allegations 0 376 45
in 0 376 45
a 0 376 45
letter 0 376 45
to 0 376 45
the 0 376 45
committee’s 0 376 45
ranking 0 376 45
member, 0 376 45
Dianne 0 376 45
Feinstein 0 376 45
(D-Calif.), 0 376 45
in 0 376 45
the 0 376 45
summer. 0 376 45

The 0 376 46
letter 0 376 46
remained 0 376 46
secret 0 376 46
from 0 376 46
July 0 376 46
30 0 376 46
through 0 376 46
until 0 376 46
September 0 376 46
13 0 376 46
when 0 376 46
he 0 376 46
first 0 376 46
learned 0 376 46
about 0 376 46
it, 0 376 46
the 0 376 46
chairman 0 376 46
said. 0 376 46

Instead 0 376 47
of 0 376 47
sharing 0 376 47
the 0 376 47
letter 0 376 47
with 0 376 47
the 0 376 47
committee, 0 376 47
Feinstein 0 376 47
did 0 376 47
nothing. 0 376 47

Before 0 376 48
the 0 376 48
hearing, 0 376 48
Kavanaugh 0 376 48
met 0 376 48
privately 0 376 48
with 0 376 48
65 0 376 48
senators, 0 376 48
including 0 376 48
Feinstein, 0 376 48
who 0 376 48
didn’t 0 376 48
ask 0 376 48
him 0 376 48
about 0 376 48
the 0 376 48
allegations 0 376 48
when 0 376 48
she 0 376 48
met 0 376 48
with 0 376 48
him 0 376 48
in 0 376 48
August. 0 376 48

The 0 376 49
committee 0 376 49
held 0 376 49
a 0 376 49
four-day 0 376 49
public 0 376 49
hearing 0 376 49
from 0 376 49
September 0 376 49
4 0 376 49
to 0 376 49
September 0 376 49
7 0 376 49
during 0 376 49
which 0 376 49
Kavanaugh 0 376 49
testified 0 376 49
for 0 376 49
more 0 376 49
than 0 376 49
32 0 376 49
hours 0 376 49
in 0 376 49
public. 0 376 49

Feinstein 0 376 50
didn’t 0 376 50
attend 0 376 50
it, 0 376 50
Grassley 0 376 50
said. 0 376 50

Kavanaugh 0 376 51
answered 0 376 51
almost 0 376 51
1,300 0 376 51
written 0 376 51
questions 0 376 51
senators 0 376 51
submitted 0 376 51
after 0 376 51
the 0 376 51
hearing. 0 376 51

That 0 376 52
is 0 376 52
“more 0 376 52
than 0 376 52
all 0 376 52
prior 0 376 52
Supreme 0 376 52
Court 0 376 52
nominees,” 0 376 52
he 0 376 52
said. 0 376 52

“Throughout 0 376 53
this 0 376 53
period, 0 376 53
we 0 376 53
did 0 376 53
not 0 376 53
know 0 376 53
about 0 376 53
the 0 376 53
ranking 0 376 53
member's 0 376 53
secret 0 376 53
evidence. 0 376 53

Then, 0 376 54
only 0 376 54
at 0 376 54
an 0 376 54
11th 0 376 54
hour, 0 376 54
on 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
eve 0 376 54
of 0 376 54
Judge 0 376 54
Kavanaugh's 0 376 54
confirmation 0 376 54
vote, 0 376 54
did 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
ranking 0 376 54
member 0 376 54
refer 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
allegations 0 376 54
to 0 376 54
the 0 376 54
FBI. 0 376 54

And 0 376 55
then, 0 376 55
sadly, 0 376 55
the 0 376 55
allegations 0 376 55
were 0 376 55
leaked 0 376 55
to 0 376 55
the 0 376 55
press.” 0 376 55

“Every 0 376 56
step 0 376 56
of 0 376 56
the 0 376 56
way 0 376 56
the 0 376 56
Democratic 0 376 56
side 0 376 56
refused 0 376 56
to 0 376 56
participate 0 376 56
in 0 376 56
what 0 376 56
should 0 376 56
have 0 376 56
been 0 376 56
a 0 376 56
bipartisan 0 376 56
investigation,” 0 376 56
Grassley 0 376 56
said. 0 376 56

After 0 376 57
Ford’s 0 376 57
identity 0 376 57
became 0 376 57
public, 0 376 57
Grassley’s 0 376 57
staff 0 376 57
“contacted 0 376 57
all 0 376 57
the 0 376 57

in 0 376 57
the 0 376 57
Washington 0 376 57
Post 0 376 57
article,” 0 376 57
he 0 376 57
said. 0 376 57

Kavanaugh 0 376 58
“immediately 0 376 58
submitted 0 376 58
to 0 376 58
an 0 376 58
interview 0 376 58
under 0 376 58
penalty 0 376 58
of 0 376 58
felony 0 376 58
for 0 376 58
any 0 376 58
knowingly 0 376 58
false 0 376 58
statements. 0 376 58

He 0 376 59
denied 0 376 59
the 0 376 59
allegations 0 376 59
categorically.” 0 376 59

“Democratic 0 376 60
staff 0 376 60
was 0 376 60
invited 0 376 60
to 0 376 60
participate 0 376 60
and 0 376 60
could 0 376 60
have 0 376 60
asked 0 376 60

wanted 0 376 60
to, 0 376 60

they 0 376 60
declined. 0 376 60

Which 0 376 61
leads 0 376 61
me 0 376 61
then 0 376 61
to 0 376 61
wonder: 0 376 61
If 1 376 61
they're 1 376 61
really 1 376 61
concerned 1 376 61
with 1 376 61
going 1 376 61
to 1 376 61
the 1 376 61
truth, 1 376 61
why 1 376 61
wouldn't 1 376 61
you 1 376 61
want 1 376 61
to 1 376 61
talk 1 376 61
to 1 376 61
the 1 376 61

Kavanaugh 0 378 1
denied 0 378 1
the 0 378 1
allegations 0 378 1
and 0 378 1
blasted 1 378 1
Senate 1 378 1
Democrats 1 378 1
for 0 378 1
their 0 378 1
involvement 0 378 1
in 0 378 1
ruining 0 378 1
his 0 378 1
good 0 378 1
name. 0 378 1

However, 0 378 2
when 0 378 2
asked 0 378 2
by 0 378 2
Senator 0 378 2
Cory 0 378 2
Booker 0 378 2
whether 0 378 2
or 0 378 2
not 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
thought 0 378 2
Ford 0 378 2
was 0 378 2
part 0 378 2
of 0 378 2
what 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
referred 0 378 2
to 0 378 2
as 0 378 2
a 0 378 2
"political 1 378 2
hit" 1 378 2
against 0 378 2
him, 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
rightly 0 378 2
steered 0 378 2
clear 0 378 2
of 0 378 2
a 0 378 2
public 1 378 2
relations 1 378 2
disaster. 1 378 2

However, 0 378 3
I 0 378 3
am 0 378 3
willing 0 378 3
to 0 378 3
say 0 378 3
would 0 378 3
he 0 378 3
would 0 378 3
not: 0 378 3
Of 1 378 3
course, 1 378 3
she 1 378 3
was 1 378 3
part 1 378 3
of 1 378 3
it! 1 378 3

I 0 378 4
don't 0 378 4
say 0 378 4
this 0 378 4
lightly. 0 378 4

There 0 378 5
are 0 378 5
many 0 378 5
things 0 378 5
that 0 378 5
we 0 378 5
heard 0 378 5
from 0 378 5
Ford 0 378 5
on 0 378 5
Thursday 0 378 5
that 0 378 5
indicate 0 378 5
there 0 378 5
is 0 378 5
more 0 378 5
going 0 378 5
on 0 378 5
than 0 378 5
she 0 378 5
was 0 378 5
willing 0 378 5
to 0 378 5
say. 0 378 5

Clearly, 0 378 6
Ford 0 378 6
has 0 378 6
been 0 378 6
outed 0 378 6
as 0 378 6
a 1 378 6
radical 1 378 6
political 1 378 6
activist 1 378 6
who 1 378 6
promotes 1 378 6
baby 1 378 6
murder 1 378 6
and 1 378 6
other 1 378 6
unlawful 1 378 6
actions. 1 378 6

However, 0 378 7
her 1 378 7
story 1 378 7
didn't 1 378 7
exactly 1 378 7
lend 1 378 7
credibility 1 378 7

Ford 0 378 18

she 0 378 18
never 0 378 18
authorized 0 378 18

it 0 378 18
was. 0 378 18

angry 1 378 20
it 1 378 20
was 1 378 20
made 1 378 20
public. 1 378 20

Why? 1 378 21

She 1 378 22
knew 1 378 22
it 1 378 22
would 1 378 22
be 1 378 22
made 1 378 22

now 0 378 23
an 0 378 23
advisor 0 378 23
to 0 378 23
Mrs. 0 378 23
Ford, 0 378 23
said 0 378 23
in 0 378 23
July 0 378 23
(at 0 378 23
roughly 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
same 0 378 23
time 0 378 23
as 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
letter 0 378 23
was 0 378 23
submitted) 0 378 23
that 0 378 23
she 0 378 23
predicted 0 378 23
a 0 378 23
"strategy" 0 378 23
forming 0 378 23
to 1 378 23
destroy 1 378 23
Brett 1 378 23
Kavanaugh. 1 378 23

She 0 378 24
suggested 0 378 24
a 0 378 24
“strategy 0 378 24
will 0 378 24
emerge” 0 378 24
to 1 378 24
destroy 1 378 24
Trump's 1 378 24
nomination 1 378 24
for 1 378 24
the 1 378 24
Supreme 1 378 24
Court 1 378 24
in 0 378 24
a 0 378 24
conference 0 378 24
call 0 378 24
with 0 378 24
the 0 378 24
American 0 378 24
Constitution 0 378 24
Society 0 378 24
in 0 378 24
July. 0 378 24

“I 0 378 25
do 0 378 25
think 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
over 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
coming 0 378 25
days 0 378 25
and 0 378 25
weeks 0 378 25
there 0 378 25
will 0 378 25
be 0 378 25
a 0 378 25
strategy 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
will 0 378 25
emerge, 0 378 25
and 0 378 25
I 0 378 25
think 0 378 25
it’s 0 378 25
possible 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
strategy 0 378 25
might 0 378 25
ultimately 0 378 25
defeat 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
nominee,” 0 378 25
Seidman 0 378 25
said 0 378 25
in 0 378 25
audio 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
was 0 378 25
recorded 0 378 25
by 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
Republican 0 378 25
National 0 378 25
Committee’s 0 378 25
War 0 378 25
Room. 0 378 25

“And 1 378 26
whether 1 378 26
or 1 378 26
not 1 378 26
it 1 378 26
ultimately 1 378 26
defeats 1 378 26
the 1 378 26
nominee 1 378 26
it 1 378 26
will, 1 378 26
I 1 378 26
think, 1 378 26
help 1 378 26
people 1 378 26
understand 1 378 26
why 1 378 26
it’s 1 378 26
so 1 378 26
important 1 378 26
that 1 378 26
they 1 378 26
vote.” 1 378 26

If 1 378 27
you 1 378 27
think 1 378 27
Mrs. 1 378 27
Ford 1 378 27
is 1 378 27
ignorant 1 378 27
of 1 378 27
this 1 378 27
considering 1 378 27
her 1 378 27
father 1 378 27
works 1 378 27
for 1 378 27
the 1 378 27
Central 1 378 27
Intelligence 1 378 27
Agency 1 378 27
and 1 378 27
her 1 378 27
prior 1 378 27
criminal 1 378 27
political 1 378 27
activism, 1 378 27
then 1 378 27
you 1 378 27
aren't 1 378 27
thinking 1 378 27
clearly. 1 378 27

Ford 1 378 28
obviously 1 378 28
has 1 378 28
mental 1 378 28
issues 1 378 28
and 1 378 28
that 1 378 28
was 1 378 28
on 1 378 28
display 1 378 28
on 1 378 28
Thursday 1 378 28
during 1 378 28
her 1 378 28
testimony. 1 378 28

She 0 378 29
clearly 0 378 29
tried 0 378 29
to 0 378 29
present 0 378 29
herself 0 378 29
as 0 378 29
a 0 378 29
victim 0 378 29
while 0 378 29
she 0 378 29
accused 0 378 29
Kavanaugh 0 378 29
of 0 378 29
sexual 0 378 29
assault 0 378 29
with 0 378 29
absolutely 1 378 29
no 1 378 29
evidence. 1 378 29

Kavanaugh 0 378 30
even 0 378 30
responded 0 378 30
by 0 378 30
pointing 0 378 30
out 0 378 30
that 0 378 30
even 0 378 30
her 0 378 30
friends 0 378 30
said 0 378 30
they 0 378 30
don't 0 378 30
recall 0 378 30
such 0 378 30
an 0 378 30
incident 0 378 30
and 0 378 30
had 0 378 30
literally 0 378 30
hundreds 0 378 30
of 0 378 30
people 0 378 30
commend 0 378 30
his 0 378 30
character 0 378 30
as 0 378 30
the 0 378 30
direct 0 378 30
opposite 0 378 30
of 0 378 30
what 0 378 30
Ford 0 378 30
claims. 0 378 30

As 0 378 31
I've 0 378 31
said 0 378 31
before, 0 378 31
I 0 378 31
don't 0 378 31
support 0 378 31
Kavanaugh's 0 378 31
appointment 0 378 31
to 0 378 31
the 0 378 31
Supreme 0 378 31
Court 0 378 31
on 0 378 31
the 0 378 31
grounds 0 378 31
of 0 378 31
lack 0 378 31
of 0 378 31
constitutional 0 378 31
rulings, 0 378 31
but 0 378 31
that 1 378 31
attack 1 378 31
on 1 378 31
him 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
orchestrated, 1 378 31
it 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
political 1 378 31
and 1 378 31
Ford 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
a 1 378 31
part 1 378 31
of 1 378 31
it. 1 378 31

It's 0 378 32
wrong. 0 378 32

Ford 0 378 33
didn't 0 378 33
even 0 378 33
think 0 378 33
to 0 378 33
act, 0 378 33
according 0 378 33
to 0 378 33
her 0 378 33
testimony, 0 378 33
until 0 378 33
Kavanaugh 0 378 33
was 0 378 33
on 0 378 33
the 0 378 33
short 0 378 33
list, 0 378 33
but 1 378 33
did 1 378 33
she 1 378 33
go 1 378 33
to 1 378 33
local 1 378 33
law 1 378 33
enforcement? 1 378 33

Nope. 0 378 34

She 0 378 35
went 0 378 35
to 0 378 35
her 0 378 35
US 0 378 35
Democrat 0 378 35
representative, 0 378 35
Senator 0 378 35
Dianne 0 378 35
Feinstein 0 378 35
and 0 378 35
The 0 378 35
Washington 0 378 35
Post. 0 378 35

If 0 378 36
that 0 378 36
is 0 378 36
not 0 378 36
political, 0 378 36
I 0 378 36
don't 0 378 36
know 0 378 36
what 0 378 36
is. 0 378 36

Ford 1 378 37
is 1 378 37
not 1 378 37
seeking 1 378 37
justice 1 378 37
nor 1 378 37
is 1 378 37
she 1 378 37
seeking 1 378 37
to 1 378 37
do 1 378 37
her 1 378 37
"civic 1 378 37
duty." 1 378 37

She 1 378 38
is 1 378 38
seeking 1 378 38
to 1 378 38
slander 1 378 38
a 1 378 38
man's 1 378 38
character 1 378 38
for 1 378 38
something 1 378 38
she 1 378 38
cannot 1 378 38
prove 1 378 38
that 1 378 38
she 1 378 38
claims 1 378 38
happened 1 378 38
over 1 378 38
36 1 378 38
years 1 378 38
ago. 1 378 38

Kavanaugh's 0 378 39
nomination 0 378 39
was 0 378 39

out 0 378 39
of 0 378 39

even 0 404 23
more 0 404 23
amazing, 0 404 23

not 0 404 23
surprising, 0 404 23
is 0 404 23
that 0 404 23
Gillum 0 404 23

that 0 404 23
his 0 404 23

the 1 404 23
utter 1 404 23
racism 1 404 23
of 1 404 23
Smith, 1 404 23
which 0 404 23
one 0 404 23
can 0 404 23
then 0 404 23
conclude 0 404 23
that 0 404 23
Gillum 0 404 23
knows 0 404 23
about 0 404 23
Smith's 0 404 23
racism 0 404 23
and 0 404 23
keeps 0 404 23
him 0 404 23

Smith. 0 404 24

“It’s 1 404 25
a 1 404 25
cracker 1 404 25
state.” 1 404 25

Smith 0 404 26
also 0 404 26
stated 0 404 26
that 0 404 26
the 0 404 26
campaign 0 404 26
has 0 404 26
“to 1 404 26
appeal 1 404 26
to 1 404 26
white 1 404 26
guilt.” 1 404 26

Good 1 404 27
luck 1 404 27
with 1 404 27
that! 1 404 27

It 0 404 28
gets 0 404 28
worse 0 404 28
though. 0 404 28

Smith 0 404 29
says 0 404 29
that 0 404 29
Gillum 0 404 29
is 1 404 29
“a 1 404 29
progressive” 1 404 29
who 1 404 29
is 1 404 29
“a 1 404 29
part 1 404 29

honesty 0 404 30
of 0 404 30
Gillum's 0 404 30
campaign 0 404 30
staff 0 404 30
on 0 404 30

“Look, 0 411 19

"At 0 411 20

Keith, 0 411 22
you're 0 411 22

It's 0 411 23
clear 0 411 23
from 0 411 23

yourself 0 411 24

you. 0 411 24

In 0 411 25
case 0 411 25
you 0 411 25
missed 0 411 25
it, 0 411 25
here's 1 411 25
a 1 411 25
still 1 411 25
frame 1 411 25
of 1 411 25
Ellison 1 411 25
just 1 411 25
a 1 411 25
few 1 411 25
feet 1 411 25
away 1 411 25
from 1 411 25
a 1 411 25
man 1 411 25
who 1 411 25
has 1 411 25
called 1 411 25
on 1 411 25
10,000 1 411 25
blacks 1 411 25
to 1 411 25
stalk 1 411 25
and 1 411 25
murder 1 411 25
white 1 411 25
people. 1 411 25

Both 0 411 26
of 0 411 26
these 0 411 26
men 0 411 26
have 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
same 0 411 26
devil 0 411 26
as 0 411 26
their 0 411 26
father 0 411 26
because 0 411 26
both 0 411 26
men 0 411 26
are 0 411 26
following 0 411 26
after 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
teaching 0 411 26
of 0 411 26
the 0 411 26
Koran 0 411 26
. 0 411 26

One 0 411 27
of 0 411 27
them 0 411 27
just 0 411 27
actually 0 411 27
has 0 411 27
the 0 411 27
nerve 0 411 27
to 0 411 27
say 0 411 27
it. 0 411 27

The 0 411 28
other 0 411 28
doesn't. 0 411 28

Maybe 0 411 29
Ellison 0 411 29
is 0 411 29
attempting 0 411 29
to 1 411 29
pull 1 411 29
an 1 411 29
Obama. 1 411 29

Remember 0 411 30
when 0 411 30
Obama's 0 411 30
"pastor," 0 411 30
Jeremiah 0 411 30
Wright 0 411 30
uttered 0 411 30
"God 0 411 30
damn, 0 411 30
America!"? 0 411 30

Obama 0 411 31
tried 0 411 31
to 0 411 31
say 0 411 31
he 0 411 31
had 0 411 31
been 0 411 31
in 0 411 31
that 0 411 31
church 0 411 31
for 0 411 31
years 0 411 31
and 0 411 31
never 0 411 31
heard 0 411 31
such 0 411 31
things, 0 411 31
which 0 411 31
isn't 0 411 31
true. 0 411 31

Ellison 1 411 32

the 0 427 12

was 0 427 12
REALLY 0 427 12
up 0 427 12

They 0 427 17

just 0 427 17

more 1 427 18
wrong. 1 427 18

He 0 427 19

He 0 427 20

He 0 427 21

“This 0 435 8

But 0 435 9
Kelly 0 435 9

hasn’t 0 435 9
considered 0 435 9

What? 0 435 12

Due 0 435 13

Wait, 0 435 14
Acosta 0 435 14
was 0 435 14

So 0 435 34
does 0 435 34
Infowars. 0 435 34

Will 0 435 35

a 0 435 35

Nope, 0 435 36
not 0 435 36
gonna 0 435 36

Because 0 435 37
it's 0 435 37
not 0 435 37

the 0 435 62

we 0 435 63

must 0 435 65

from 0 435 68
now 0 435 68

the 0 443 19

has 0 443 19
been 0 443 19
told. 0 443 19

Sources 0 443 20
have 0 443 20

Manafort 0 443 20
went 0 443 20

2016 0 443 20
– 0 443 20
during 0 443 20
the 0 443 20
period 0 443 20
when 0 443 20
he 0 443 20

It 0 443 21
is 0 443 21
unclear 0 443 21
why 0 443 21
Manafort 0 443 21
wanted 0 443 21
to 0 443 21
see 0 443 21
Assange 0 443 21
and 0 443 21
what 0 443 21
was 0 443 21
discussed. 0 443 21

But 0 443 22
the 0 443 22
last 0 443 22
meeting 0 443 22
is 0 443 22
likely 0 443 22
to 0 443 22
come 0 443 22

A 0 443 23
well-placed 0 443 23
source 0 443 23
has 0 443 23
told 0 443 23
the 0 443 23
Guardian 0 443 23
that 0 443 23
Manafort 0 443 23
went 0 443 23
to 0 443 23

Assange 0 443 23
around 0 443 23
March 0 443 23
2016. 0 443 23

Months 0 443 24
later 0 443 24

Russian 0 443 24
intelligence 0 443 24
officers. 0 443 24

Manafort, 0 443 25
69, 0 443 25
denies 0 443 25
involvement 0 443 25
in 0 443 25
the 0 443 25
hack 0 443 25
and 0 443 25
says 0 443 25
the 1 443 25
claim 1 443 25
is 1 443 25
“100% 1 443 25
false”. 1 443 25

His 0 443 26
lawyers 0 443 26
declined 0 443 26
to 0 443 26
answer 0 443 26
the 0 443 26
Guardian’s 0 443 26
questions 0 443 26
about 0 443 26
the 0 443 26
visits. 0 443 26

The 0 443 27
piece 0 443 27
did 0 443 27
not 0 443 27
include 0 443 27
the 0 443 27
public 0 443 27
denial 0 443 27
Wikileaks 0 443 27
issued 0 443 27

its 0 443 27

a 0 443 27
half 0 443 27
hour 0 443 27
before 0 443 27
it 0 443 27
was 0 443 27
published. 0 443 27

The 0 443 28
Guardian 0 443 28
piece 0 443 28
came 0 443 28
at 0 443 28
a 0 443 28
critical 0 443 28
moment. 0 443 28

Currently 0 443 29
the 0 443 29
U.K. 0 443 29
and 0 443 29
Ecuador 0 443 29
conspire 0 443 29
to 0 443 29
deliver 0 443 29
Julian 0 443 29
Assange 0 443 29
to 0 443 29
U.S. 0 443 29
authorities. 0 443 29

On 0 443 30
Monday 0 443 30
special 0 443 30
counsel 0 443 30
Robert 0 443 30
Mueller 0 443 30
said 0 443 30
Manafort 0 443 30
lied 0 443 30
to 0 443 30
investigators, 0 443 30
violating 0 443 30
his 0 443 30
recent 0 443 30
plea 0 443 30
deal. 0 443 30

The 0 443 31
new 0 443 31
sensational 1 443 31
claim 1 443 31
was 0 443 31
immediately 0 443 31
picked 0 443 31
up 0 443 31
by 0 443 31
prominent 0 443 31
reporters 0 443 31
and 0 443 31
major 0 443 31
main 0 443 31
stream 0 443 31
outlets. 0 443 31

They 0 443 32
distributed 0 443 32
is 0 443 32
as 0 443 32
a 0 443 32
factual 0 443 32
account. 0 443 32

It 0 443 33
is 0 443 33
likely 0 443 33
that 0 443 33
millions 0 443 33
of 0 443 33
people 0 443 33
took 0 443 33
note 0 443 33
of 0 443 33
its 0 443 33
claim. 0 443 33

But 1 443 34
several 1 443 34
people 1 443 34
who 1 443 34
had 1 443 34
followed 1 443 34
the 1 443 34
Russiagate 1 443 34
fairytale 1 443 34
and 1 443 34
the 1 443 34
Mueller 1 443 34
investigation 1 443 34
were 1 443 34
immediately 1 443 34
suspicious 1 443 34
of 1 443 34
the 1 443 34
Guardian 1 443 34
claim. 1 443 34

The 1 443 35
story 1 443 35
was 1 443 35
weakly 1 443 35
sourced 1 443 35
and 1 443 35
included 1 443 35
some 1 443 35
details 1 443 35
that 1 443 35
seemed 1 443 35
unlikely 1 443 35
to 1 443 35
be 1 443 35
true. 1 443 35

Glenn 0 443 36
Greenwald 0 443 36
noted 0 443 36
that 0 443 36
the 0 443 36
Ecuadorian 0 443 36
embassy 0 443 36
is 0 443 36
under 0 443 36
heavy 0 443 36
CCTV 0 443 36
surveillance. 0 443 36

There 0 443 37
are 0 443 37
several 0 443 37
guards, 0 443 37
and 0 443 37
visitors 0 443 37
have 0 443 37
to 0 443 37
provide 0 443 37
their 0 443 37
identity 0 443 37
to 0 443 37
enter 0 443 37
it. 0 443 37

Every 0 443 38
visit 0 443 38
is 0 443 38
logged. 0 443 38

If 0 443 39
Manafort 0 443 39
had 0 443 39
really 0 443 39
visited 0 443 39
Assange, 0 443 39
it 0 443 39
would 0 443 39
have 0 443 39
long 0 443 39
been 0 443 39
known: 0 443 39

In 1 443 40
sum, 1 443 40
the 1 443 40
Guardian 1 443 40
published 1 443 40
a 1 443 40
story 1 443 40
today 1 443 40
that 1 443 40
it 1 443 40
knew 1 443 40
would 1 443 40
explode 1 443 40
into 1 443 40
all 1 443 40
sorts 1 443 40
of 1 443 40
viral 1 443 40
benefits 1 443 40
for 1 443 40
the 1 443 40
paper 1 443 40
and 1 443 40
its 1 443 40
reporters 1 443 40
even 1 443 40
though 1 443 40
there 1 443 40
are 1 443 40
gaping 1 443 40
holes 1 443 40
and 1 443 40
highly 1 443 40
sketchy 1 443 40
aspects 1 443 40
to 1 443 40
the 1 443 40
story. 1 443 40

Moreover, 1 443 41
the 1 443 41
main 1 443 41
author 1 443 41
of 1 443 41
the 1 443 41
story, 1 443 41
Luke 1 443 41
Harding, 1 443 41
is 1 443 41
known 1 443 41
to 1 443 41
be 1 443 41
a 1 443 41
notorious 1 443 41
fraud, 1 443 41
a 1 443 41
russo-phobe 1 443 41
intelligence 1 443 41
asset 1 443 41
with 1 443 41
a 1 443 41
personal 1 443 41

towards 1 443 41

Wikileaks. 1 443 41

A 0 443 42
year 0 443 42
ago 0 443 42
an 0 443 42
important 0 443 42
Moon 0 443 42
of 0 443 42
Alabama 0 443 42
piece 0 443 42
- 0 443 42
From 0 443 42

To 0 443 42
Russia-gate 0 443 42

The 0 443 42

mentioned 0 443 42
Harding: 0 443 42

The 0 443 43
people 0 443 43
who 0 443 43
promote 0 443 43
the 1 443 43
"Russian 1 443 43
influence" 1 443 43
nonsense 1 443 43
are 0 443 43
political 1 443 43
operatives 1 443 43
or 1 443 43
hacks. 1 443 43

Take 1 443 44
for 1 443 44
example 1 443 44
Luke 1 443 44
Harding 1 443 44
of 1 443 44
the 1 443 44
Guardian 1 443 44
who 1 443 44
just 1 443 44
published 1 443 44
a 1 443 44
book 1 443 44
titled 1 443 44
Collusion: 1 443 44
Secret 1 443 44
Meetings, 1 443 44
Dirty 1 443 44
Money, 1 443 44
and 1 443 44
How 1 443 44
Russia 1 443 44
Helped 1 443 44
Donald 1 443 44
Trump 1 443 44
Win. 1 443 44

He 1 443 45
was 1 443 45
taken 1 443 45
apart 1 443 45
in 1 443 45
a 1 443 45
Real 1 443 45
News 1 443 45
interview 1 443 45
(vid) 1 443 45
about 1 443 45
the 1 443 45
book. 1 443 45

The 1 443 46
interviewer 1 443 46
pointed 1 443 46
out 1 443 46
that 1 443 46
there 1 443 46
is 1 443 46
absolutely 1 443 46
no 1 443 46
evidence 1 443 46
in 1 443 46
the 1 443 46
book 1 443 46
to 1 443 46
support 1 443 46
its 1 443 46
claims. 1 443 46

When 1 443 47
asked 1 443 47
for 1 443 47
any 1 443 47
proof 1 443 47
for 1 443 47
his 1 443 47
assertion 1 443 47
Harding 1 443 47
defensively 1 443 47
says 1 443 47
that 1 443 47
he 1 443 47
is 1 443 47
just 1 443 47
"storytelling" 1 443 47
- 1 443 47
in 1 443 47
other 1 443 47
words: 1 443 47
it 1 443 47
is 1 443 47
fiction. 1 443 47

Harding 1 443 48
earlier 1 443 48
wrote 1 443 48
a 1 443 48
book 1 443 48
about 1 443 48
Edward 1 443 48
Snowden 1 443 48
which 1 443 48
was 1 443 48
a 1 443 48
similar 1 443 48
sham. 1 443 48

Julian 1 443 49
Assange 1 443 49
called 1 443 49
it 1 443 49
"a 1 443 49
hack 1 443 49
job 1 443 49
in 1 443 49
the 1 443 49
purest 1 443 49
sense 1 443 49
of 1 443 49
the 1 443 49
term". 1 443 49

Harding 1 443 50
is 1 443 50
also 1 443 50
known 1 443 50
as 1 443 50
plagiarizer. 1 443 50

When 1 443 51
he 1 443 51
worked 1 443 51
in 1 443 51
Moscow 1 443 51
he 1 443 51
copied 1 443 51
stories 1 443 51
and 1 443 51
passages 1 443 51
from 1 443 51
the 1 443 51
now 1 443 51
defunct 1 443 51
Exile, 1 443 51
run 1 443 51
by 1 443 51
Matt 1 443 51
Taibbi 1 443 51
and 1 443 51
Mark 1 443 51
Ames. 1 443 51

The 1 443 52
Guardian 1 443 52
had 1 443 52
to 1 443 52
publish 1 443 52
an 1 443 52
apology. 1 443 52

The 1 443 53
new 1 443 53
Guardian 1 443 53
story 1 443 53
looked 1 443 53
like 1 443 53
another 1 443 53
weak 1 443 53
attempt 1 443 53
to 1 443 53
connect 1 443 53
the 1 443 53
alleged 1 443 53
Russian 1 443 53
malfeasance 1 443 53
with 1 443 53
Assange 1 443 53
and 1 443 53
the 1 443 53
Wikileaks 1 443 53
publishing 1 443 53
of 1 443 53
the 1 443 53
DNC 1 443 53
emails. 1 443 53

Assange 1 443 54
and 1 443 54
other 1 443 54
involved 1 443 54
people 1 443 54
deny 1 443 54
that 1 443 54
such 1 443 54
a 1 443 54
relation 1 443 54

Manafort 0 443 64

secret 0 443 64
talks 0 443 64
with 0 443 64
Assange 0 443 64

Ecuadorian 0 443 64
embassy, 0 443 64
sources 0 443 64
say 0 443 64
... 0 443 64

It 0 443 65
is 0 443 65
unclear 0 443 65
why 0 443 65
Manafort 0 443 65
would 0 443 65
have 0 443 65
wanted 0 443 65

Assange 0 443 65

what 0 443 65

But 0 443 66
the 0 443 66
last 0 443 66

out 0 443 68
Assange 0 443 68

like 1 443 80
its 1 443 80

evidently 1 443 80
completely 1 443 80
false. 1 443 80

Wikileaks 1 443 81
publicly 1 443 81

there 0 443 86

The 1 443 87
story 1 443 87
was 1 443 87
completely 1 443 87
false 1 443 87
and 1 443 87
the 1 443 87
Guardian 1 443 87
knew 1 443 87
it 1 443 87
was. 1 443 87

It 1 443 88
disregarded 1 443 88
and 1 443 88
left 1 443 88
out 1 443 88
the 1 443 88
denials 1 443 88
the 1 443 88
subjects 1 443 88

for 1 443 89
British 1 443 89
government 1 443 89
disinformation 1 443 89
operations 1 443 89
aimed 1 443 89
at 1 443 89
defaming 1 443 89
Russia. 1 443 89

It 1 443 90
smeared 1 443 90
Assange 1 443 90
and 1 443 90
Snowden 1 443 90
as 1 443 90
Russian 1 443 90
collaborators. 1 443 90

It 1 443 91
uncritically 1 443 91
peddled 1 443 91
the 1 443 91
Russiagate 1 443 91
story 1 443 91
and 1 443 91
the 1 443 91
nonsensical 1 443 91
Skripal 1 443 91
claims 1 443 91
which 1 443 91
are 1 443 91
both 1 443 91
obviously 1 443 91
concocted 1 443 91
by 1 443 91
British 1 443 91

services. 1 443 91

That 1 443 92

to 1 443 92

the 1 443 94
Guardian’s 1 443 94
smear 1 443 94
on 1 443 94
its 1 443 94
face, 1 443 94
the 1 443 94
fact 1 443 94
that 1 443 94
the 1 443 94
Guardian 1 443 94
published 1 443 94
this 1 443 94
piece, 1 443 94
and 1 443 94
that 1 443 94
Luke 1 443 94

operating 1 443 94
with 1 443 94
even 1 443 94
the 1 443 94
tiniest 1 443 94
modicum 1 443 94
of 1 443 94
respect 1 443 94
as 1 443 94
a 1 443 94
journalist 1 443 94
despite 1 443 94
his 1 443 94
history 1 443 94
of 1 443 94
deceit, 1 443 94
tells 1 443 94
us 1 443 94
something 1 443 94
bone-chilling 1 443 94
about 1 443 94
journalism. 1 443 94

It 1 443 95
is 1 443 95
no 1 443 95
accident 1 443 95
that 1 443 95
Luke 1 443 95
Harding 1 443 95
is 1 443 95
still 1 443 95
employed: 1 443 95
in 1 443 95
fact, 1 443 95
it 1 443 95
is 1 443 95
because 1 443 95
of 1 443 95
Harding’s 1 443 95
consistent 1 443 95
loyalty 1 443 95
to 1 443 95
establishment, 1 443 95
specifically 1 443 95
the 1 443 95
UK 1 443 95
intelligence 1 443 95
apparatus, 1 443 95
over 1 443 95
the 1 443 95
truth 1 443 95
that 1 443 95
determines 1 443 95
his 1 443 95
“success” 1 443 95
amongst 1 443 95
legacy 1 443 95
press 1 443 95

Harding 1 443 96
is 1 443 96
not 1 443 96
a 1 443 96
defacement 1 443 96
or 1 443 96
a 1 443 96
departure 1 443 96
from 1 443 96
the 1 443 96
norm, 1 443 96

it. 1 443 96

point: 0 443 97

The 0 443 98
truth 0 443 98
is 0 443 98
that 0 443 98
the 0 443 98
Guardian 0 443 98

this 0 443 98
latest 0 443 98

regularly 1 443 99
does 1 443 99
when 1 443 99
supposedly 1 443 99
vital 1 443 99
western 1 443 99
foreign 1 443 99
policy 1 443 99
interests 1 443 99
are 1 443 99
at 1 443 99
stake 1 443 99
– 1 443 99
it 1 443 99
simply 1 443 99
regurgitates 1 443 99
an 1 443 99
elite-serving, 1 443 99
western 1 443 99
narrative. 1 443 99

Its 1 443 100
job 1 443 100
is 1 443 100
to 1 443 100
shore 1 443 100
up 1 443 100
a 1 443 100
consensus 1 443 100
on 1 443 100
the 1 443 100
left 1 443 100
for 1 443 100
attacks 1 443 100
on 1 443 100
leading 1 443 100
threats 1 443 100
to 1 443 100
the 1 443 100
existing, 1 443 100
neoliberal 1 443 100
order: 1 443 100
... 1 443 100

The 1 443 101
Guardian 1 443 101
did 1 443 101
not 1 443 101
make 1 443 101
a 1 443 101
mistake 1 443 101
in 1 443 101
vilifying 1 443 101
Assange 1 443 101
without 1 443 101
a 1 443 101
shred 1 443 101
of 1 443 101
evidence. 1 443 101

It 1 443 102
did 1 443 102
what 1 443 102
it 1 443 102
is 1 443 102
designed 1 443 102
to 1 443 102
do. 1 443 102

We 1 443 103
have 1 443 103
previously 1 443 103
shown 1 443 103
that 1 443 103
the 1 443 103
Guardian 1 443 103
even 1 443 103
uses 1 443 103
fascist 1 443 103
propaganda 1 443 103
tropes 1 443 103
to 1 443 103
smear 1 443 103
the 1 443 103
Russian 1 443 103
people. 1 443 103

It 1 443 104
is 1 443 104
openly 1 443 104
publishing 1 443 104
Goebbels' 1 443 104
cartoons 1 443 104
and 1 443 104
rhetoric 1 443 104
against 1 443 104
Europes 1 443 104
biggest 1 443 104
state. 1 443 104

There 1 443 105
is 1 443 105
no 1 443 105
longer 1 443 105
any 1 443 105
line 1 443 105
that 1 443 105
it 1 443 105
does 1 443 105
not 1 443 105
dare 1 443 105
to 1 443 105
cross. 1 443 105

Unfortunately 1 443 106
other 1 443 106
'western' 1 443 106
media 1 443 106
are 1 443 106
not 1 443 106
much 1 443 106
better. 1 443 106

Within 0 443 107
hours 0 443 107
of 0 443 107
being 0 443 107
published 0 443 107
the 0 443 107
Guardian 0 443 107
piece 0 443 107
was 0 443 107
debunked 0 443 107
as 0 443 107
fake 0 443 107
news. 0 443 107

That 0 443 108
did 0 443 108
not 0 443 108
hinder 0 443 108
other 0 443 108
outlets 0 443 108
to 0 443 108
add 0 443 108
to 0 443 108
its 0 443 108
smear. 1 443 108

Politico 1 443 109
allowed 1 443 109
"a 1 443 109
former 1 443 109
CIA 1 443 109
officer," 1 443 109
writing 1 443 109
under 1 443 109
a 1 443 109
pen 1 443 109
name, 1 443 109
to 1 443 109
suggest 1 443 109
- 1 443 109
without 1 443 109
any 1 443 109
evidence 1 443 109
- 1 443 109
that 1 443 109
the 1 443 109
Guardian 1 443 109
has 1 443 109
been 1 443 109
duped 1 443 109
- 1 443 109
not 1 443 109
by 1 443 109
its 1 443 109
MI5/6 1 443 109
and 1 443 109
Ecuadorian 1 443 109
spy 1 443 109
sources, 1 443 109
but 1 443 109
by 1 443 109
Russian 1 443 109
disinformation: 1 443 109

Rather 0 443 110
than 0 443 110
being 0 443 110
the 1 443 110
bombshell 1 443 110
smoking 1 443 110
gun 1 443 110
that 1 443 110
directly 1 443 110
connects 1 443 110
the 1 443 110
Trump 1 443 110
campaign 1 443 110
to 1 443 110
WikiLeaks, 1 443 110
perhaps 0 443 110
the 0 443 110
report 0 443 110
is 0 443 110
something 0 443 110
else 0 443 110
entirely: 0 443 110
a 1 443 110
disinformation 1 443 110
campaign. 1 443 110

Is 1 443 111
it 1 443 111
possible 1 443 111
someone 1 443 111
planted 1 443 111
this 1 443 111
story 1 443 111
as 1 443 111
a 1 443 111
means 1 443 111
to 1 443 111
discredit 1 443 111
the 1 443 111
journalists? 1 443 111

... 0 443 112

Harding 0 443 113
is 0 443 113
likely 0 443 113
a 0 443 113
major 0 443 113
target 0 443 113
for 0 443 113
anyone 0 443 113
wrapped 0 443 113
up 0 443 113
in 0 443 113
Russia’s 0 443 113

If 0 443 115
this 0 443 115
latest 0 443 115

about 0 443 115
Manafort 0 443 115

Assange 0 443 115
is 0 443 115
false—that 0 443 115
is, 0 443 115
if, 0 443 115
for 0 443 115
example, 0 443 115
the 0 443 115
sources 0 443 115
lied 0 443 115
to 0 443 115
Harding 0 443 115
and 0 443 115
Collyns 0 443 115

they 0 443 115
were 0 443 115
being 0 443 115
truthful 0 443 115
in 0 443 115
their 0 443 115
statements 0 443 115
to 0 443 115
the 0 443 115
journalists), 0 443 115
or 0 443 115
if 0 443 115
the 0 443 115
Ecuadorian 0 443 115
intelligence 0 443 115
document 0 443 115
is 0 443 115
a 0 443 115
fake, 0 443 115
the 0 443 115
most 0 443 115
logical 0 443 115
explanation 0 443 115
is 0 443 115
that 0 443 115
it 0 443 115
is 0 443 115
an 0 443 115
attempt 0 443 115
to 0 443 115
make 0 443 115
Harding 0 443 115
look 0 443 115
bad. 0 443 115

The 1 443 116
is 1 443 116
zero 1 443 116
evidence 1 443 116
in 1 443 116
the 1 443 116
Politico 1 443 116

supports 1 443 116
its 1 443 116
suggestions 1 443 116
and 1 443 116
claims. 1 443 116

It 1 443 117
is 1 443 117
fake 1 443 117
news 1 443 117
about 1 443 117
a 1 443 117
fake 1 443 117
news 1 443 117
story. 1 443 117

It 0 443 118
also 0 443 118
included 0 443 118
the 0 443 118
false 0 443 118
claim 0 443 118
that 0 443 118
Glenn 0 443 118

on 0 443 118
the 0 443 118

That 0 443 119
claim 0 443 119
was 0 443 119
later 0 443 119
removed. 0 443 119

We 0 443 120
have 0 443 120
seen 0 443 120
a 0 443 120
similar 0 443 120
pattern 0 443 120
in 0 443 120
the 0 443 120
Skripal 0 443 120
affair. 0 443 120

When 0 443 121
'western' 0 443 121
intelligence 0 443 121
get 0 443 121
caught 0 443 121
in 0 443 121
spreading 0 443 121
disinformation, 0 443 121
they 0 443 121
accuse 0 443 121

the 0 443 121
source 0 443 121
of 0 443 121
the 0 443 121
fake. 0 443 121

no 1 443 122
western 1 443 122
main 1 443 122

to 1 443 122
publish 1 443 122
the 1 443 122
truth. 1 443 122

The 0 443 123
Guardian 0 443 123
is 0 443 123
only 0 443 123
one 0 443 123
