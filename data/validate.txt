at 0

for 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
on 0
Saturday. 0

20,000 0
people 0
came 0
out 0
to 0
call 0
for 0
Tommy’s 0
release, 0
and 0
Wilders 0
took 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
political 0
elites 0
of 0
Britain 0
and 0
continental 0
Europe 0
on 0
notice. 0

“Our 1
governments,” 1
Wilders 0
declared, 0
“sold 0
us 0
out 0
with 0
mass 0
immigration. 0

With 0
Islamization. 0

With 0
open 0
borders. 0

We 0
are 0
almost 0
foreigners 0
in 0
our 0
own 0
lands. 0

And 0
if 0
we 0
complain 0
about 0
it, 0
they 0
call 0
us 0
racists 1

Islamophobes. 1

But 0
I 0
say, 0
no 1
more! 1

And 0
what 0
do 0
you 0
say? 0

No 1
more! 1

And 0
that’s 0
right: 0
enough 0
is 0
enough. 0

We 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
gagged 0
anymore. 0

No 1
more 1
tyranny.” 1

It 0
was 0
extraordinary 0
that 0
the 0
British 0
authorities 0
allowed 0
Wilders 0
into 0
the 0

at 0
all. 0

Several 0

although 0
the 0

Sellner, 0

Lauren 0

thereby 0

least 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
criticism 0
of 0
Islam, 0
Muslim 1
rape 1
gangs, 1
and 0
mass 0
Muslim 0
migration. 0

Even 0
worse, 0
the 0
bannings 0
of 0
Sellner, 0
Pettibone, 0
Southern, 0
and 0
Bachmann 0
were 0
just 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
pattern. 0

Pamela 0
Geller 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
Britain 0
in 0
2013, 0
apparently 0
for 0
life, 0
also 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
telling 0
the 1
truth 1
about 1
Islam 1
and 1
jihad. 1

Meanwhile, 0
Britain 0
has 0
a 0
steadily 0
lengthening 0
record 0
of 0
admitting 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
without 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
hesitation. 1

Syed 0
Muzaffar 0
Shah 0
Qadri’s 0
preaching 1
of 1
hatred 1
and 1
jihad 1
violence 1
was 0
so 0
hardline 1
that 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
preaching 0
in 0
Pakistan, 0
but 0
the 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
welcomed 0
him 0
into 0
Britain. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
also 0
admitted 0
Shaykh 0
Hamza 0
Sodagar 0
into 0
the 0
country, 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
said: 0
“If 0
there’s 0
homosexual 0
men, 0
the 0
punishment 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
five 0
things. 0

One 0
– 0
the 0
easiest 0
one 0
maybe 0
– 0
chop 0
their 0
head 0
off, 0
that’s 0
the 0
easiest. 0

Second 0
– 0
burn 0
them 0
to 0
death. 0

Third 0
– 0
throw 0
’em 0
off 0
a 0
cliff. 0

Fourth 0
– 0
tear 0
down 0
a 0
wall 0
on 0
them 0
so 0
they 0
die 0
under 0
that. 0

Fifth 0
– 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
the 0
above.” 0

Theresa 0
May’s 0
relentlessly 1
appeasement-minded 1
government 0
also 0
admitted 0
two 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
who 0
had 0
praised 0
the 0
murderer 0
of 0
a 0
foe 0
of 0
Pakistan’s 0
blasphemy 0
laws. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
was 0
welcomed 0
by 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Canterbury. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
UK 0
banned 0
three 0
bishops 0
from 0
areas 0
of 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria 0
where 0
Christians 0
are 0
persecuted 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
country. 0

But 0
now 0
matters 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
a 0
head. 0

Apparently 0
British 0
authorities 0
decided 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
too 0
politically 0
costly 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
bar 0
Wilders 0
again. 0

And 0
so 0
he 0
entered, 0
and 0
spoke, 0
and 0
gave 0
them 0
a 0
strong 0
dose 0
of 0
the 0
reality 1
that 0
they 0
are 0
determined 0
to 0
ignore 0
and 0
deny. 0

Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
in 0
prison 0
today 0
because 0
he 0
violated 0
a 0
court 0
order 0
demanding 0
that 0
he 0
not 0
film 0
videos 0
outside 0
the 0
trials 0
of 0
Muslim 1
rape 1
gangs. 1

Clearly 0
the 1
government’s 1
intent 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
that 1
as 1
few 1
people 1
as 1
possible 1
discovered 1
the 1
truth 1
about 0
its 0
massive, 0
years-long 0
cover-up 0
of 0
those 0
rape 1
gangs, 1
and 0
refusal 0
to 0
prosecute 0
the 0
perpetrators. 0

Theresa 0
May 0
and 0
company 0
obvious 0
hope 0
that 0
other 0
Britons 0
who 0
are 0
furious 0
about 0
the 0
sacrifice 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 0
British 1
girls 1
to 0
the 0
idols 0
of 0
“diversity” 0
and 0
“multiculturalism” 0
will 0
see 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
Tommy, 0
and 0
be 0
frightened 0
into 0
silence. 0

The 0
British 0
government, 0
in 0
imprisoning 0
Tommy 0
Robinson, 0
has 0
shown 0
itself 0
willing 0
to 0
incarcerate 0
people 0
for 0
having 0
opinions 0
that 0
it 0
considers 0
unacceptable. 0

That 0
heralds 0
the 1
death 1
of 1
Britain 1
as 1
a 1
free 1
society 1
and 0
the 0
beginning 1
of 1
an 1
authoritarian 1
police 1
state 1
there, 0
unless 1
this 1
slide 1
to 1
totalitarianism 1
is 1
stopped 1
now. 1

British 0
public 0
figures, 0
whatever 0
criticism 0
they 0
have 0
leveled 0
against 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
should 0
be 0
calling 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
be 0
freed 0
today, 0
or 1
else 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
exposing 1
themselves 1
as 1
supporting 1
the 1
degeneration 1
of 1
Britain 1
into 0
a 0
police 0
state. 0

Wilders 0
addressed 0
this 0
endeavor 0
head-on, 0
declaring: 0
“We 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
silenced. 1

We 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
intimidated. 1

And 1
we 1
tell 1
the 1
governments, 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
you. 1

We 1
will 1
never 1
surrender. 1

We 1
will 1
stand 1
strong 1
and 1
do 1
our 1
duty. 1

We 1
will 1
defend 1
our 1
civilization. 1

And 1
we 1
will 1
protect 1
our 1
people.” 1

Wilders 0
added: 0
“And 0
I 0
tell 0
you, 0
to 0
the 0
governments. 0

You 0
can 0
throw 0
us 0
in 0
jail, 0
but 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
defeat 0
us. 0

Because, 0
my 0
friends, 0
for 0
every 0
Tommy 0
whom 0
you 0
imprison, 0
thousands 0
will 0
rise 0
up. 0

So 0
take 1
notice, 1
Theresa 0
May. 0

Take 1
notice, 1
Dutch 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Rutte. 0

Take 1
notice, 1
Mrs. 0
Merkel 0
or 0
President 0
Macron. 0

Take 1
notice: 1
the 1
future 1
is 1
ours 1
and 1
not 1
yours. 1

We 0
will 0
defeat 0
you 0
politically, 0
because 0
we, 0
my 0
friends, 0
we 1
are 1
the 1
people.” 1

If 1
Wilders’ 1
words 1
don’t 1
prove 1
true, 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
because 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
free 1
societies 1
in 1
Britain 1
and 1
Western 1
Europe 1
is 1
truly 1
at 1
hand. 1

an 0

Senator 1
Flake? 1

It's 0
a 0
good 0
thing 0
he'll 0

Why 0

a 0

in 0
which 0
the 0

from 0

Simultaneously, 0

also 0
apparently 0

that 0

What 0
started 0
after 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
as 0
a 0
reduction 0
in 0
the 0
rate 0
of 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
foreign-born 0
population 0
of 0
working 0
age 0
has 0
turned 0
into 0
an 1
outright 1
retreat. 1

This 0
is 0
in 0
dramatic 1
contrast 1
to 0
the 0
last 0
months 0
of 0
the 0
Obama 0
Regime, 0
which 0
saw 0
year-over-year 0
increases 0
in 0
immigrant 0

population 0
far 0
in 0
excess 0
of 0
the 0
estimated 0
1 0
million 0
legal 0
immigrants 0
admitted 0
annually, 0
and 1
which 1
I 1
argued 1
meant 1
that 1
an 1
unreported 1

alien 1

was 1
underway. 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Labor 0
Department 0

report 0
released 0
last 0

in 0

in 0
December 0
2017 0
than 0
in 0
December 0
2016—a 0
decline 0
of 0
0.18%. 0

This 0
follows 0

of 0
138,000 0

August, 0
143,000 0

Not 0
since 0
the 0
Great 0

has 0
the 0

declined 0
for 0
five 0
consecutive 0
months—but 0
now, 0
in 0
telling 0

the 0
economy 0
is 0
expanding. 0

This 0
makes 0
the 0
Trump 0

immigrant 0
workforce 0
decline 0
especially 1
striking. 1

Note 0
that 0
this 0
is 0

net 0
figure. 0

The 0
year-over- 0
year 0
reduction 0
in 0
the 0
immigrant 0

does 0
not 0
mean 0
new 0

have 0
stopped 0

300,000 0

at 0
Dulles 0

trying 0

him 0
with 0
fraudulently 0
gathering 0

up 0

at 0

When 0
his 0

died 0
on 0
Jan. 0
16, 0
2017, 0
the 0
youngest 0
Awan 0
brother, 0
Jamal, 0
attested 0
on 0
the 0
death 0
certificate 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
insurance 0
company 0
that 0
his 0
father 0
was 0

a 0
statement 0
Gilani’s 0
lawyer 0
said 0
would 0
have 0
kept 0
her 0
from 0
the 0

A 0
Virginia 0

later 0
ruled 0
that 0
Jamal’s 0
statement 0
about 0
his 0

status 0
on 0
the 0

wrong. 0

“Why 1

Bacon 0

of 0

at 0

date. 0

On 0

Imran 0
and 0
Alvi 0
– 0
who 0
was 0
also 0
on 0

some 0
of 0

Jan. 0

according 0
to 0

On 0

17, 0

filed 0
notarized 0
papers 0
using 0
those 0
rights 0
to 0
replace 0
Gilani 0
with 0
himself 0
as 0
beneficiary. 0

The 0
life 0
insurance 0

timing 0
seems 0
to 0
coincide 0
with 0
other 0
moves 0
by 0
Abid 0
to 0
liquidate 0
property 0
and 0
transfer 0
it. 0

Ten 0
weeks 0
prior, 0
on 0
Nov. 0
1, 0
2016, 0
Alvi 0
sold 0
a 0
house 0

Jamal 0
for 0
$620,000, 0
netting 0
another 0
significant 0
profit 0
from 0
the 0
mortgage 0
company. 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
his 0
primary 0
residence, 0
Abid 0
owned 0
the 0
house 0
where 0
his 0
mother 0

lived, 0
and 0
moved 0
in 0
after 0
his 0
death, 0
with 0
Gilani 0
becoming 0
homeless. 0

Abid 0
owned 0
two 0
homes 0
despite 0
a 0
$1 0
million 0
2012 0
bankruptcy 0
that 0
might 0
ordinarily 0
have 0
forced 0
him 0
to 0
sell 0
the 0
second 0
home 0
to 0
pay 0
creditors. 0

At 0
that 0
time, 0
he 0
filed 0
forms 0
“under 0
penalty 0
of 0
perjury” 0
that 0
two 0
houses 0
were 0
needed 0
as 0
“my 0

I 0

Nataliia 0
Sova 0
– 0
who 0
also 0
was 0
on 0

on 0
the 0

“spouse 0

living 0
together. 0

Gilani 0

TheDCNF 0
the 0
brothers 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0

which 0
were 0

valuable 0
than 0
the 0
$50,000 0
policy. 0

Americo, 0
the 0
life 0

said 0
there 0
was 0
“great 1
doubt” 1
about 0

14, 0
two 0

the 0
House 0
sargent-at-arms 0
banned 0
the 0
Awans 0
for 0
“suspicious 0

Gilani 0
alleged 0
the 0
brothers 0
took 0
her 0
financial 0
documents, 0
a 0
laptop, 0
and 0
her 0
husband’s 0
possessions. 0

The 0
only 0
lawyer 0
she 0
could 0
afford, 0
she 0
claimed, 0
was 0
Michael 0
Hadeed, 0
a 0

who 0
was 0
convicted 0
in 0
2010 0
of 0

according 0
to 0

Hadeed 1
did 1
not 1
introduce 1
any 1
evidence 1
to 1
the 1
judge 1
about 1
a 1
pattern 1
of 1
possible 1
fraud 1
by 1
Abid, 1
the 1
timing 1
of 1
the 1
move 1
as 1
it 1
relates 1
to 1
the 1
federal 1
criminal 1
case, 1
or 1
the 1
mental 1
capacity 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
man 1
to 1
understand 1
paperwork. 1

Hadeed 0
withdrew 0
earlier 0
allegations 0
of 0
fraud 0
and 0
asked 0
the 0
judge 0
to 0
try 0
the 0
case 0
based 0
solely 0
on 0
interpretation 0
of 0
contract 0
language. 0

After 0
court, 0
Hadeed 0
told 0
reporters 0
Bacon 0
had 0
threatened 0
to 0
sue 0
him 0
for 0
defamation. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
subject 0
myself 0
to 0
that,” 0
he 0
said 0
outside 0
court. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
myself 0
in 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
over 0
this.” 0

In 0
court, 0
Bacon 0
badgered 0
Hadeed. 0

“Are 0
you 0
going 0
to 0
share 0
any 0
more 0
info 0
with 0
them? 0

I 0
hope 0
not. 0

I 0
hope 0
you 0
learned 0
that 0
lesson,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“You 1
have 1
no 1
control 1
over 1
[Gilani], 1
do 1
you? 1

You’re 0
like, 0
talking 1
to 1
a 1
wall,” 1
he 0
said 0
of 0
Gilani. 0

Hadeed 0
said 0
three 0
different 0
signatures 0
from 0
Abid 0
on 0
financial 0
documents 0
did 0
not 0
match, 0
and 0
put 0
a 0
defiant 0
Abid 0
on 0
the 0
witness 0
stand. 0

Hadeed: 0
Why 1
do 1
your 1
signatures 1
look 1
different? 1

Abid: 0
My 0
signatures 0
are 0
not 0
very 0
consistent, 0
I’m 1
just 1
a 1
human 1
being… 1

Hadeed: 0
You 0
were 0
aware 0
you 0
were 0
changing 0
beneficiary 0
from 0
your 0
father’s 0
spouse 0
to 0
yourself? 0

Abid: 0
That 0
was 0
my 0
father’s 0
request… 0

Hadeed: 0
You’re 0
not 0
answering 0
the 0
question. 0

Abid: 0
I’m 0
not 0
very 0
smart, 0
so 0
it 0
takes 0
a 0
while 0
sometimes… 0

Judge: 0
I 1
don’t 1
understand 1
why 1
the 1
witness 1
is 1
having 1
such 1
trouble 1
with 1
the 1
question. 1

Your 0
job 0
is 0
to 0
answer 0
the 0
question. 0

In 0
court 0
documents, 0
Gilani 0
alleged, 0
“while 0
he 0
was 0
admitted 0
in 0
hospital 0
my 0
telephone 0
conversations 0
were 0
taped 0
and 0
some 0
other 0
recording 0
devices 0
were 0
also 0
installed/planted 0
in 0
my 0
house 0
… 0
Imran 0
Awan 0
showed 0
up 0
and 0
threatened 0
me 0
for 0
me 0
calling 0
the 0
police. 0

[Imran] 0
threatened 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
powerful 1
and 0
if 1
I 1
ever 1
call 1
the 1
police 1
again 1
[he] 1
will 1
do 1
harm 1
to 1
me.” 1
She 0
said 0
that 0
Imran 0
eventually 0
agreed 0
to 0
remove 0
the 0
listening 0
devices 0
and 0
did 0
so 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
her. 0

Based 0
on 0
Hadeed’s 0
narrow 0
legal 0
argument 0
about 0
the 0
life 0
insurance 0
contract’s 0
language, 0
the 0
judge 0
ruled 0
that, 0
“The 0
son 0
as 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
the 0
policy 0
has 0
the 0
absolute 0
right 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
beneficiary.” 0

After 0
Gilani 0
retained 0
a 0
lawyer, 0
Bacon 0
had 0
offered 0
a 0
settlement 0
where 0
they’d 0
split 0
the 0
money, 0
but 0
Gilani 0
declined 0
it. 0

The 0
court 0
awarded 0
Abid 0
the 0
$50,000 0
life 0
insurance 0
payout, 0
minus 0
$5,000 0
that 0
the 0
insurance 0
company 0
took 0
for 0
its 0
expenses 0
in 0
litigating 0
the 0
fraud 0
allegations. 0

“You 0
should 0
have 0
taken 0
the 0
settlement. 0

Now 0
she’s 0
not 0
getting 0
a 0
penny,” 0
Bacon 0
said 0
in 0
court. 0

“You’re 0
not 0
getting 0
anything.” 0

Gilani 0
said 0
after 0
court 0
that 0
her 0
conscience 0
didn’t 0
allow 0
her 0
to 0
settle. 0

“I 0
didn’t 0
do 0
the 0
deal 0
because 0
they 0
had 0
been 0
adopting 0
bad 0
behaviors. 0

I 0
cannot 0
agree 0
to 0
that. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
about 0
the 0
money,” 0
she 0
said. 0

her 0
1999 0

allegation 0
against 0

Ms. 0

“Not 0

Oh 1
my 1
gosh, 1
they 0
did 0
not 0
want 0

about 0

She 1
pointed 1
to 1
the 1
discrepancy 1
between 1
Democratic 1
lack 1
of 1

and 1
the 1

leveled 1
last 1

against 1

“Oh, 0
it 0
makes 0
me 0
go 0
back 0

1999, 0
when 0

Ingraham 0
on 0
Monday. 0

“They 0
would 0

today.” 0
Ms. 0
Broaddrick 0
has 0
also 0

out 1
at 0

who 0

Ms. 0

“You 1

You, 1
Dicky 1
Durban 1
[sic], 1
are 1
a 1

Ms. 0

the 1
36-year-old 1
accusations 1
against 1
Mr. 1

they 1
should 1
reopen 1
her 1
40-year-old 1

If 1

to 1
go 1
back 1

let’s 1
investigate 1
my 1
RAPE 1
allegations 1
against 1
Bill 1
Clinton, 1
too. 1

Seems 0
only 0
fair. 0

She 0
has 0
long 0
accused 0
Mr. 0
Clinton 0
of 0
raping 0
her 0
a 0
motel 0
room 0
in 0
1978 0
in 0
Little 0
Rock, 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Arkansas 0
attorney 0
general. 0

“Go 0
back 0

far, 0
let’s 0
investigate 0
my 0
situation,” 0
she 0
said 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“Why 0
not? 0

Everybody 0
says 0
well 0
it 0

never 0
litigated, 0
it 0
was 0

It 0
never 0

her 0
when 0

in 0

You 0
can 0
see 0
her 0
out 0
there 0
at 0
the 0
Clinton 0

next 0
to 0
Samantha 0
Power, 0
palling 0
around 0
with 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett 0
or 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

Dina 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
was 0
an 0
influential 0
figure 0
in 0
the 0
Bush 0
administration. 0

The 0
Egyptian-American 0
immigrant 0
had 0
served 0
as 0
a 0
gatekeeper 0
for 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush. 0

If 0
you 0
wanted 0
a 0
job, 0
you 0
went 0
through 0
her. 0

Barely 0
30, 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
more 0
power 0
than 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
big 0
Bush 0
era 0
names 0
you 0
do 0
know. 0

Then 0
she 0
took 0
on 0
the 0
mission 0
of 0
promoting 0
America 0
to 0
the 0
Muslim 0
world 0
at 0
the 0
State 0
Department. 0

There 0
were 0
cultural 0
exchanges 0
with 0
Iran 0
and 0
money 0
for 0
Lebanon 0
and 0
the 0
Palestinian 0
Authority. 0

Afterward 0
it 0
was 0
off 0
to 0
make 0
millions 0
through 0
philanthropy 0
at 0
the 0
Goldman 0
Sachs 0
Foundation. 0

Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
all 0
the 0
right 0
friends. 0

Like 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett. 0

Arianna 0
Huffington 0
praised 0

You 0
could 0
see 0
her 0
posing 0

The 0

was 0
originally 0
Rashid 0

was 0
the 0
former 0
PLO 0
spokesman 0
at 0
the 0
center 0
of 0
the 0
Obama 0
tape 0
scandal. 0

And 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
was 0
there 0
as 0
a 0
presenter 0
at 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
Institute 0
after 0
a 0
speech 0
by 0
the 0
PLO’s 0
Hanan 0
Ashrawi. 0

Unlike 0
McFarland, 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
no 0
national 0
security 0
background. 0

But 0
though 0
her 0
parents 0
were 0
Christians, 0
she 0
had 0
the 0
“right” 0
views 0
on 0
Islam. 0

In 0
Egypt, 0
she 0
had 0
described 0
how 0
Bush 0
after 0
September 0
11 0
had, 0
“visited 0
a 0
mosque, 0
took 0
off 0
his 0
shoes 0
and 0
paid 0
his 0
respects.” 0
"I 0
see 0
the 0
president 0
talk 0
of 0
Islam 0
as 0
a 0
religion 0
of 0
peace, 0
I 0
see 0
him 0
host 0
an 0
iftar 0
every 0
year.” 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
attended 0
such 0
an 0
iftar 0
dinner. 0

Habib 0
Powell 0
has 0
been 0
described 0
as 0
the 0
Republican 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

And 0
she 0
was 0
quoted 0
as 0
saying 0
that 0
Abedin 0
“feels 0
a 0
deep 0
responsibility 0
to 0
encourage 0
more 0
mutual 0
understanding 0
between 0
her 0
beliefs 0
and 0
culture 0
and 0
American 1
culture.” 1

And 0
Powell 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
cheerful 0
terms 0
with 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
Obama 0
unmasker. 0

And 0
with 0
Clintonworld 0
people. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Dina 0
Powell 0
– 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
Deputy 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
in 0
2017 0
– 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
far 0
left-wing 0
United 0
Nations 0
Ambassador 0
Samantha 0
Power 0
for 0
an 0
interview. 0

In 0
that 0
interview, 0
Powell 0
heaped 0
effusive 0
praise 0
upon 0
Power 0
and 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
nodding 0
in 0
agreement 0
throughout. 0

Power 0
was 0
a 0
senior 0
adviser 0
to 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Powell 0
– 0
an 0
executive 0
with 0
Goldman 0
Sachs 0
– 0
was 0
pushing 0
a 0
pet 0
project 0
known 0
as 0
10,000 0
women, 0
which 0
is 0
ostensibly 0
intended 0
to 0
foster 0
female 0
entrepreneurship. 0

When 0
Powell 0
was 0
at 0
Goldman 0
Sachs, 0
her 0
right-hand 0
woman 0
in 0
the 0
10,000 0
Women 0
program 0
was 0
Noa 0
Meyer. 0

Perhaps 0
not 0
so 0
coincidentally, 0
Meyer 0
worked 0
in 0
the 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
administration’s 0
speech-writing 0
office 0
of 0
then 0
first-lady 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

Powell 0
herself, 0
is 0
very 0
comfortable 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

In 0
2013, 0
she 0
shared 0
a 0
stage 0
with 0
Hillary 0
at 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative. 0

In 0
2007, 0
Powell 0
was 0
named 0
to 0
the 0
Board 0
of 0
a 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
project 0
known 0
as 0
‘Vital 0
Voices’,another 0
women-centric 1
operation 0
that 0
touts 0
Global 0
Ambassadorial 0
missions 0
for 0
women. 0

On 0
June 0
14, 0
2016 0
Powell 0
participated 0
in 0
a 0
Summit 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
United 0
State 0
of 0
Women(USW), 0
which 0
meshed 1
nicely 1
with 0
her 0
pet 0
project. 0

USW 0
was 0
also 0
rife 0
with 0
angry 1
left-wing 1
Democrats 1
seeking 0
to 0
get 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
elected 0
in 0
2016. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
closest 0
adviser 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett 0
introduced 0
Powell, 0
who 0
returned 0
the 0
introduction 0
with 0
effusive 0
praise 0
for 0
Jarrett. 0

The 0
ex-Goldman 0
Sachs 0
executive 0
has 0
befriended 0
Obama’s 0
closest 0
adviser, 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett. 0

She 0
is 0
also 0
very 0
cozy 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
closest 0
advisers 0
Huma 0
Abedin 0
and 0
Philippe 0
Reines. 0

Now 0
there's 0
once 0
again 0
talk 0
of 0
moving 0
Dina 0
Powell 0
in. 0

This 0
time 0
into 0
Nikki 0
Halley's 0
old 0
spot 0
as 0
UN 0
Ambassador. 0

The 0
talk 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment. 0

Powell 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
at 0
the 0
NSC, 0
where 0
she 0
replaced 0
K.T. 0

McFarland, 0
who 0
was 0
qualified 0
for 0
the 0
job, 0
at 0
the 0
behest 0
of 0
H.R. 0

McMaster. 0

But 0
every 0
job 0
for 0
Powell 0
is 0
a 0
stepping 0
stone 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
one. 0

And 0
the 0
one 0
she 0
has 0
her 0
eyes 0
on 0
now 0
would 0
be 0
an 0
even 1
bigger 1
disaster. 1

Making 0
Dina 0
Powell 0
the 0
US 0
Ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
would 0
quickly 0
undo 0
all 0
the 0
progress 0
that 0
Haley 0
made. 0

Before 0
long 0
the 0
US 0
would 0
be 0
right 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
Human 0
Rights 0
Council, 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
moves 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
the 0
PLO, 0
and 0
the 0
same 1
old 1
failed 1
politics 1
would 0
be 0
back. 0

Haley 0
sent 0
a 0
message 0
that 0
UN 0
members 0
will 0
be 0
punished 0
if 0
they 0
push 0
the 0
US 0
around. 0

Powell 0
would 0
swiftly 1
undo 1
that. 0

Dina 0
Powell 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
Jeb 0
Bush 0
appointee. 0

Appointing 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
UN 1
would 1
give 1
Trump, 1
Jeb 1
Bush's 1
policies. 1

You 0
don't 0
drain 0
the 0
swamp 0
by 0
appointing 0
the 0
swamp. 0

And 0
Powell 0
is 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
swamp 1
creatures 1
in 1
D.C. 1

an 0

to 0

according 0
to 0

Pennsylvania 0
Congressman 0
Scott 0
Perry. 0

Appearing 0
on 0

he 0
had 0
personally 0
seen 0
that 0
suggested 0
that 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
terrorist 0
infiltration 0
aided 0
the 0
Las 0

Massacre. 0

One 1
can 1
imagine 1
that 1
said 0
terrorists 0
either 0
helped 0
Paddock 0
or 0
were 0
actually 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
many 0
other 0
shooters 0
reported 0
that 0
night. 0

“Recently, 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
made 0
aware 0
of 0
what 0
i 0
believe 0
to 0
be 0

terrorist 0
infiltration, 0
through 0
the 0
southern 0

regarding 0
this 0
event,” 0
Perry 0
shockingly 0
claimed. 0

“Let’s 1
face 1
it, 1
twice 1
before 1

warned 1
the 1

that 1
they 1
would 1
attack 1

and 1
then 1
after 1
the 1
attack 1
claimed 1
responsibility 1
four 1
times,” 1
Perry 0
continued. 0

Keep 0
in 0
mind 0
that 0
this 0
lines 0
up 0
with 0
other 0
alternative 0
media 0
reports 0
regarding 0
the 0
Oct. 0
1st 0
massacre 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
hints 0
provided 0
in 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media. 0

We 0
also 0
know 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
conclusive 0
fact 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
shooter, 0
according 0
to 0
literally 0
dozens 0
of 0
eyewitnesses 0
who 0
have 0
continued 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
with 0
what 0
they 0
saw 0
that 0
fateful 0
night. 0

Interestingly, 1
there 0
are 0
also 0
reports 0
that 0

New 0
York 0
Times 0
has 0
now 0
run 0
its 0
own 0
explainer 0
piece 0
on 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
the 0
Dems 0
which 0
mentions 0
the 0
infamous 0
Obama-Farrakhan 0
photo. 0

There's 0
also 0
a 0
quote 0
from 0
an 0
Obama 0
spokeswoman 0
claiming 0
that, 0
“President 0
Obama 0
has 0
denounced 0
racism 0
and 0
anti-Semitism 0
his 0
entire 0
life. 0

That 0
includes 0
his 0
public 0
and 0
repeated 0
repudiations 0
of 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan’s 0
views 0
over 0
the 0
years. 0

Today 0
is 0
no 0
different 0
– 0
he 0
still 0
rejects 0
the 1
harmful 1
and 1
divisive 1
views 1
Farrakhan 0
continues 0
to 0
espouse.” 0

That 0
fails 1
to 1
explain 1
why 1
he 1
met 1
with 1
him. 1

And 0
maybe 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
days 0
someone 0
will 0
ask 0
him 0
that 0
question. 0

And 0
then 0
Obama 0
can 0
give 0
a 0
new 0
remix 0
of 0
his 0
Wright 0
speech. 0

"I 0
can 0
no 0
more 0
disavow 0
Calypso 0
Louie 0
than 0
I 0
can 0
my 0
dead 0
white 0
grandmother." 0

Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis, 0
after 0
defending 0
Farrakhan, 0
now 0
has 0
a 0
statement 0
condemning 0
him. 0

But 1
we've 1
seen 1
that 1
before. 1

So 1
it 1
likely 1
doesn't 1
represent 1
his 1
views. 1

After 0
a 0
previous 0
statement, 0
Rep. 0
Davis 0
made 0
an 0
infamous 0
comment 0
about 0
the 0
"Jewish 0
question". 0

So 0
it 0
probably 0
still 0
isn't 0
over. 0

The 1
statement 1
though 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
conspiracy 1
theories 1
and 1
blames 1
everyone 1
else 1
for 1
Davis' 1
behavior 1
except 1
him. 1

And 0
now 0
on 0
to 0
"civil 1
rights 1
hero" 1
(TM) 0
Rep. 0
Clyburn. 0

South 0
Carolina 0
Rep. 0
James 0
Clyburn 0
attended 0
a 0
2011 0
event 0
with 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
shared 0
the 0
stage 0
with 0
him, 0
even 0
after 0
Jewish 0
groups 0
voiced 0
their 0
opposition 0
to 0
Clyburn 0
attending 0
the 0
event. 0

Clyburn 0
told 0
the 0
Final 0
Call, 0
a 0
Nation 0
of 0
Islam 0
publication, 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
“not 0
bothered 0
in 0
the 0
least 0
bit” 0
by 0
criticisms 0
of 0
his 0
attendance 0
at 0
the 0
event. 0

As 0
the 0
assistant 0
Democratic 0
leader, 0
Clyburn 0
is 0
the 0
third-highest 0
ranked 0
Democrat 0
in 0
the 0
House. 0

He 1
declined 1
to 1
condemn 1
Farrakhan 1
in 1
a 1
statement 1
released 1
to 1
The 1
Daily 1
Caller 1
News 1
Foundation 1
on 1
Thursday. 1

“I 1
have 1
fought 1
all 1
my 1
life 1
to 1
advance 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
social 1
justice 1
and 1
equality, 1
and 1
I 1
have 1
always 1
opposed 1
bigotry 1
in 1
all 1
its 1
forms,” 1
Clyburn 1
said 1
in 1
the 1
statement. 1

His 0
office 0
declined 0
repeated 0
inquiries 0
regarding 0
whether 0
the 0

is 0
willing 0
to 0
condemn 0
Farrakhan, 0
and 0
whether 0
he 0
stood 0
by 0
his 0
decision 0
in 0
2011 0
to 0
shrug 0
off 0
criticisms 0
of 0
Farrakhan. 0

Clyburn 0
is 0
now 0
the 0
eighth 0
House 0
Democrat 0
to 0
have 0
direct 0
ties 0
to 0
Farrakhan. 0

The 0

called 0
on 0

seven 0

over 0
their 0

Obviously 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
happen. 1

But 0
the 0
story 0
is 0
breaking 0
through 0
the 0

We're 1
starting 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
"national 1

about 1

that 1

Mueller 0
is 0
‘looking 1

Trump 0
says 0
cryptically 1

WASHINGTON 0
— 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
continued 0
bashing 1
Robert 0
S. 0
Mueller 0
III’s 0
Russia 0
investigation, 0
saying 1
cryptically 1
Monday 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
is 0
“looking 1
for 1
trouble.” 1

Trump 0
alleged 0
in 0
a 0
morning 0
tweet 0
series 0
that 0
the 0
former 0
FBI 0
director 0
is 0
“Disgraced 1
and 1
discredited,” 1
claiming 0
his 1
staff 1
amounts 1
to 1
nothing 1
more 1
than 1
a 1
“group 1
of 1
Angry 1
Democrat 1
Thugs.” 1

That 0
came 0
hours 0
after 0
a 0
Sunday 0
tweet 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
team 0
as 0
a 1
“gang.” 1
Both 0
are 0
words 0
with 0
loaded 0
meanings 0
for 0
his 0
conservative 0
political 0
base. 0

The 0
president’s 0
Sunday 0
and 0
Monday 0
attacks 0
on 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
came 0
after 0
reports 0
that 0
White 0
House 0
Counsel 0
Donald 0
McGahn 0
was 0
interviewed 0
by 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team 0
for 0
more 0
than 0
one 0
full 0
day. 0

Trump 0
contends 0
he 0
signed 0
off 0
on 0
the 0
testimony; 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush-era 0
White 0
House 0
counsel 0
and 0
attorney 0
general 0
Alberto 0
Gonzales, 0
however, 0
told 0
CNN 0
Monday 0
morning 0
that 0
a 0
sitting 0
White 0
House 0
counsel 0
would 0
be 0
required 0
to 0
fully 0
cooperate 0
with 0
a 0
federal 0
investigation 0
because 0
he 0
is 0
a 0
government 0
lawyer, 0
not 0
a 0
president’s 0
personal 0
attorney. 0

But 0
Trump 0
on 0
Monday 0
morning 0
tweeted 0
that 0
McGahn 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
team 0
for 0
“over 0
30 0
hours 0
with 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Councel, 0
only 0
with 0
my 0
approval, 0
for 0
purposes 0
of 0
transparency.” 0
(The 1
tweet 1
included 1
a 1
misspelling 1
of 1
“counsel.”) 1

The 0
length 0
of 0
the 0
Mueller-McGahn 0
sessions 0
led 0
Trump 0
to 0
the 0
conclusion 0
the 0
special 0
counsel 0
is 0
“looking 1
for 1
trouble” 1
because 0
they 0
“they 1
know 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
Russian 1
Collusion.” 1

But 0
Mueller 0
reportedly 0
is 0
keenly 0
interested 0
in 0
a 0
widely 0
studied 0
June 0
2016 0
Trump 0
Tower 0
meeting 0
arranged 0
by 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
Jr., 0
which 0
included 0
a 0
Russian 0
attorney 0
who 0
promised 0
to 0
hand 0
over 0
negative 0
information 0
about 0
Democratic 0
presidential 0
nominee 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

The 0
session 0
also 0
was 0
attended 0
by 0
then-campaign 0
chairman 0
Paul 0
Manafort 0
and 0
Trump 0
son-in-law 0
Jared 0
Kushner; 0
the 1
president 1
dictated 1
a 1
misleading 1
statement 1
about 1
it 1
a 1
year 1
later 1
and 1
it 1
remains 1
murky 1
just 1
when 1
he 1
learned 1
about 1
the 1
meeting. 1

As 0
Roll 0
Call 0
has 0
reported, 0
Trump 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
tower 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
the 0
session 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 0
lawyer. 0

The 0
president 0
also 0
continued 0
to 0
push 0
a 0
line 0
first 1
floated 1
by 0
his 0
attorney, 0
former 0
New 0
York 0
mayor 0
and 0
U.S. 0
attorney 0
Rudolph 0
Giuliani, 0
tweeting 0
that 0
campaign 0
collusion 0
with 0
Russia 0
would 0
be 0
a 1
“phony 1
crime.” 1
He’s 0
right, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
specific 0
collusion 0
statute. 0

But 1
legal 1
experts 1
say 1
anyone 1
in 1
Trump’s 1
orbit 1
would 1
be 1
charged 1
with 1
conspiracy, 1
making 1
false 1
statements 1
to 1
federal 1
investigators 1
or 1
obstructing 1
justice. 1

All 1
are 1
federal 1
crimes. 1

Trump 1
also 1
continued 1
to 1
cast 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
victim 1
in 1
the 1
matter, 1
saying 1
when 1
he 1
attempts 1
to 1
“FIGHT 1
BACK 1
or 1
say 1
anything 1
bad 1
about 1
the 1
Rigged 1
Witch 1
Hunt,” 1
his 1
critics 1
“scream 1
Obstruction!” 1

Mueller 0
also 0
is 0
looking 0
at 0
whether 0
some 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
actions 0
like 0
firing 0
then-FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
B. 0
Comey 0
or 0
statements 0
about 0
the 0
Russia 0
probe 0
since 0
taking 0
office 0
amount 0
to 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
interfere 0
illegally 0
with 0
the 0
special 0

As 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
continues 0
his 0
five-year-long 0
tirade 0
against 0
the 1
imaginary 1
Catholic 1
Pharisees 1
who 0
defend 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
on 0
the 0
indissolubility 0
of 0
marriage 0
and 0
the 0
integrally 0
related 0
Eucharistic 0
discipline—he 0
is 0
still 0
at 0
it 0
as 0
of 0
yesterday 0
(January 0
9)—he 0
and 1
his 1
collaborators 1
are 1
busily 1
engineering 1
neo-Pharisaical 1
escape 1
hatches 1
from 1
the 1
negative 1
precepts 1
of 1
the 1
divine 1
and 1
natural 1
law 1
emanating 1
from 1
the 1
Sixth 1
Commandment. 1

Determined 0
to 0
quell 0
any 0
Catholic 0
opposition 0
to 0
his 0
moral 0
subversion, 0
Francis 0
has 0
slapped 0
the 0
label 0
Authentic 0
Magisterium® 0
on 0
his 0
outrageous 0
opinion 0
that 0
in 0
“complex 0
circumstances” 0
wherein 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
“feasible” 0
to 0
live 0
as 0
brother 0
and 0
sister, 0
two 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
not 0
married 0
can 0
be 0
admitted 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
without 0
ceasing 0
extra-marital 0
sexual 0
relations 0
so 0
long 0
as 0
they 0
engage 0
in 0
an 0
ill-defined 0
“process 0
of 0
discernment.” 0
As 0
Father 0
Brian 0
Harrison 0
has 0
so 0
trenchantly 0
observed, 0
this 0
means 0
that 0
people 0
embroiled 0
in 0
adultery 0
can 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
while 0
they 0
“discern” 0
that 0
they 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
receiving 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
embroiled 0
in 0
adultery. 0

Do 1
they 1
think 1
we 1
are 1
fools? 1

Then 0
there 0
is 0
the 0
endlessly 0
double-talking 0
Cardinal 0
Müller. 0

In 0
a 0
recent 0
interview 0
concerning 0
Rocco 0
Buttiglione’s 0
verbal 1
contortions 1
aimed 0
at 0
demonstrating 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
to 0
public 0
adulterers 0
is 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
Church’s 0
bimillenial 0
prohibition 0
of 0
precisely 0
that, 0
Müller 0
proposed 0
this 0
preposterous 1
“solution” 1
to 0
a 0
“problem” 0
that 0
does 0
not 0
exist: 0

It 0
is 0
possible 0
that 0
the 0
penitent 0
may 0
be 0
convinced 0
in 0
conscience, 0
and 0
with 0
good 0
reasons, 0
of 0
the 0
invalidity 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
marriage 0
even 0
though 0
they 0
cannot 0
offer 0
canonical 0
proof. 0

In 0
this 0
case 0
the 0
marriage 0
valid 0
before 0
God 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
second 0
one 0
and 0
the 0
pastor 0
could 0
grant 0
the 0
sacrament, 0
certainly 0
with 0
the 0
appropriate 0
precautions 0
as 0
not 0
to 0
scandalize 0
the 0
community 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
not 0
to 0
weaken 0
the 0
conviction 0
of 0
marriage 0
indissolubility. 0

The 0
Cardinal 0
knows 0
this 0
is 0
moral 1
and 1
canonical 1
nonsense. 1

No 1
Catholic, 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
consults 1
a 1
priest, 1
can 1
declare 1
for 1
himself 1
that 1
his 1
marriage 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
was 1
invalid, 1
especially 1
when—indeed 1
because—he 1
lacks 1
canonical 1
proof 1
of 1
invalidity. 1

Moreover, 0
absent 0
an 0
annulment 0
granted 0
by 0
the 0
competent 0
Church 0
tribunal, 0
a 0
purported 0
“second 0
marriage” 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
an 0
invalid 0
civil 0
ceremony 0
and 0
thus 0
a 0
thinly 0
disguised 0
form 0
of 0
continuous 0
public 0
adultery. 0

Cardinal 0
Burke, 0
whom 0
Francis 0
sacked 0
as 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
highest 0
tribunal 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
impediment 0
to 0
the 1
conspiracy 1
culminating 1
in 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia 1
(AL), 0
has 0
observed 0
the 0
obvious 0
in 0
this 0
regard: 0

Such 0
cases 0
do 0
not 0
exist. 0

No 0
priest 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
declare 0
a 0
marriage 0
null 0
in 0
the 0
internal 0
forum. 0

Marriage 0
is 0
a 0
public 0
state 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
the 0
judgment 0
regarding 0
an 0
accusation 0
of 0
nullity 0
of 0
marriage 0
must 0
be 0
made 0
in 0
accord 0
with 0
the 0
long 0
practice 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

If 1
a 1
college 1
of 1
judges 1
in 1
a 1
matrimonial 1
tribunal 1
is 1
not 1
able 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
moral 1
certitude 1
regarding 1
the 1
nullity 1
of 1
a 1
marriage 1
after 1
a 1
careful 1
and 1
thorough 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
petition 1
of 1
nullity, 1
how 1
can 1
an 1
individual 1
priest 1
be 1
capable 1
of 1
making 1
such 1
a 1
judgment 1
having 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
eternal 1
salvation 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
in 1
question? 1

The 0
only 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
priest 0
could 0
admit 0
a 0
person 0
living 0
in 0
an 0
irregular 0
matrimonial 0
union 0
to 0
receive 0
the 0
Sacraments 0
of 0
Penance 0
and 0
Holy 0
Eucharist 0
is 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
who 0
agree 0
to 0
live 0
“as 0
brother 0
and 0
sister”, 0
that 0
is 0
to 0
respect 0
the 0
marriage 0
to 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
bound 0
by 0
not 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
marital 0
way 0
with 0
another 0
person. 0

Even 0
then, 0
the 0
priest 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
insist 0
that 0
the 0
couple 0
living 0
in 0
continence 0
receive 0
the 0
Sacraments 0
in 0
a 0
place 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
well 0
known, 0
lest 0
other 0
faithful 0
be 0
led 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
persons 0
living 0
in 0
an 0
irregular 0
matrimonial 0
union 0
may 0
receive 0
the 0
Sacraments. 0

Does 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
think 0
we 0
are 0
fools? 0

Some 0
of 0
us 0
apparently 0
are, 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
are 0
willing 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
knowing 0
dupes 0
by 0
defending 0
neo-Pharisaical 0
sophistry 0
that 0
would 0
produce 0
“a 0
discipline 0
alien 0
to 0
the 0
entire 0
Tradition 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
and 0
Apostolic 0
faith.” 0

Apparently, 0
they 0
think 0
they 0
can 0
fool 1
us 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
phase 0
of 0
the 0
program 0
of 0
moral 0
subversion 0
that 0
this 0
incredible 0
Pope 0
seriously 0
expects 0
us 0
to 0
believe 0
is 0
an 0
imperative 0
of 0
“mercy”: 0
the 0
justification 0
of 0
contraception 0
in 0
“complex 0
cases” 0
to 0
which 0
“discernment” 0
must 0
be 0
applied. 0

Consider 0
the 0
recent 0
declaration 0
by 0
one 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
new 0
appointments 0
to 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Academy 0
for 0
Life, 0
whose 0
entire 0
membership 0
he 0
sacked 0
and 0
whose 0
constitution 0
he 0
ordered 0
rewritten 0
to 0
neutralize 0
it. 0

In 0
a 0
lecture 0
at 0
the 0
Gregorian, 0
one 0
Father 0
Maurizio 0
Chiodi, 0
a 0
“moral 0
theologian” 0
of 0
the 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
variety, 0
proposed 0
that 0
“an 0
artificial 0
method 0
for 0
the 0
regulation 0
of 0
births 0
could 0
be 0
recognized 0
as 0
anact 0
of 0
responsibilitythat 0
is 0
carried 0
out, 0
not 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
radically 0
reject 0
the 0
gift 0
of 0
a 0
child, 0
but 0
because 0
in 0
those 0
situationsresponsibility 0
calls 0
the 0
couple 0
and 0
the 0
family 0
to 0
other 0
forms 0
of 0
welcome 0
and 0
hospitality.” 0

That 0
is, 0
Francis’s 0
man 0
at 0
the 0
reconstituted 0
Pontifical 0
Academy 0
declares 0
openly 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
duty 0
to 0
contracept! 0

Chiodi’s 0
sole 0
“authority” 0
for 0
this 0
lie 1
from 1
the 1
pit 1
of 1
hell 1
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
Chapter 0
8 0
of 0
AL, 0
the 0
only 0
document 0
of 0
its 0
kind 0
in 0
the 0
entire 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

AL 0
will 0
doubtless 0
be 0
providing 0
cover 0
for 0
a 0
whole 0
new 0
line 0
of 0
Authentic 0
Magisterium® 0
products, 0
all 1
of 1
which 1
will 1
be 1
utter 1
fakes, 1
including 1
some 1
form 1
of 1
“pastoral 1
integration” 1
of 1
homosexual 1
unions. 1

Evidently, 0
they 0
do 0
think 0
we 0
are 0
fools 1
or 0
willing 0
to 0
play 0
the 0
fool 1
in 0
exchange 0
for 0
the 0
benefits 0
of 0
respectable 0
conformity 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
an 0
unparalleled 0
debacle 0
for 0
the 0
Church. 0

(Consider 0
the 0
example 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Answers, 0
which 0
“defends 0
the 0
Faith” 0
while 0
refusing 0
to 0
recognize 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
under 0
ferocious 0
attack 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
vertices 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

Silence 1
at 1
best 1
is 1
the 1
price 1
it 1
must 1
pay 1
for 1
remaining 1
in 1
good 1
standing 1
with 1
the 1
pro-homosexual 1
bishop 1
Francis 1
has 1
installed 1
in 1
San 1

“No, 0

Monahan 0
tweeted 0
in 0
response 0
to 0
a 0
question 0
whether 0
the 0

believes 0
women’s 0
stories. 0

“I’ve 0
been 0
smeared, 0

isolated 0
from 0

I 0

I 0

She 0
added: 0
“Four 0
people, 0

went 0
to 0
reiterate 0
that 0
her 0

nothing 0
to 0
do 0
with 0

“I 0
have 0
nothing 0

to 0
anyone, 0
I 0
simply 0
shared 0
my 0

not. 0

I 0
don’t 0
need 0

I 0
affirmed 0
it,” 0
she 0

“The 0
fact 0
that 0
both 0

only 0

Garcia 0
Zarate 0
in 0
the 0
shooting 0

of 0

death 1
on 1

Garcia 0

Zarate, 0
a 0
45-year-old 0
Mexican 0
national 0
who 0
was 0
homeless 0
and 0
living 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
illegally 0
when 0
he 0
fired 0
the 0
shot 0
that 0
killed 0
Steinle, 0
was 0
acquitted 0
by 0
a 0
jury 0
on 0
murder 0
and 0
manslaughter 0
charges. 0

The 0
jury 0
convicted 0
him 0
of 0
the 0
lesser 0
charge 0
of 0
being 0
a 0
felon 0
in 0
possession 0
of 0
a 0
gun, 0
which 0
carries 0
a 0
maximum 0
sentence 0
of 0
three 0
years 0
in 0
state 0
prison. 0

Steinle, 0

32, 0
was 0
fatally 0
shot 0
while 0
she 0
walked 0
along 0
Pier 0
14 0
of 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
Bay 0
with 0
her 0
father 0
in 0
July 0
2015. 0

The 0
bullet 0
that 0
pierced 0
her 0
back 0
had 0
ricocheted 0
off 0
the 0
concrete 0
ground 0
after 0
it 0
was 0
fired 0
by 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
from 0
a 0
handgun 0
belonging 0
to 0
a 0
federal 0
ranger 0
that 0
had 0
been 0
stolen 0
four 0
days 0
earlier. 0

Garcia 0

Zarate's 0
defense 0
attorneys 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
shooting 0
was 0
an 0
accident 0
— 0
they 0
said 0
he 0
found 0
the 0
gun 0
wrapped 0
in 0
a 0
T-shirt 0
or 0
cloth 0
under 0
a 0
pier 0
bench 0
and 0
unintentionally 0
discharged 0
it. 0

Lead 0
attorney 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
has 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
weapon 0
was 0
a 0
SIG 0
Sauer 0
with 0
a 0
"hair 1
trigger 1
in 1
single-action 1
mode" 1
— 0
a 0
model 0
well-known 0
for 0
accidental 0
discharges 0
even 0
among 0
experienced 0
shooters. 0

Gonzalez 0
told 0
the 0
jury, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
Chronicle, 0
that 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
never 0
handled 0
a 0
firearm 0
before, 0
was 0
frightened 0
by 0
the 0
noise 0
of 0
the 0
gunshot, 0
then 0
flung 0
the 0
weapon 0
into 0
the 0
bay 0
where 0
it 0
was 0
later 0
found 0
by 0
a 0
diver. 0

Prosecutors, 0

however, 0
alleged 0
that 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
brought 0
the 0
weapon 0
to 0
the 0
pier 0
deliberately 0
to 0
do 0
harm, 0
and 0
intentionally 0
aimed 0
and 0
shot 0
Steinle 0
after 0
firmly 0
pulling 0
the 0
trigger. 0

They 0
said 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
then 0
threw 0
the 0
weapon 0
into 0
the 0
bay 0
and 0
fled 0
the 0
scene. 0

Beyond 0

the 0
shooting 0
itself, 0
perhaps 0
the 0
most 0
controversial 0
aspect 0
of 0
Garcia 0
Zarate's 0
case 0
involves 0
his 0
previous 0
criminal 0
activity 0
and 0
history 0
of 0
deportations, 0
and 0
how 0
San 0
Francisco 0
and 0
federal 0
authorities 0
handled 0
his 0
custody 0
before 0
he 0
ever 0
picked 0
up 0
the 0
gun 0
and 0
shot 0
Steinle. 0

At 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
Steinle's 0
death, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
been 0
convicted 0
of 0
nonviolent 0
drug 0
crimes 0
and 0
deported 0
five 0
times 0
since 0
the 0
early 0
1990s. 0

He 0

faced 0
a 0
sixth 0
deportation 0
in 0
2015, 0
and 0
was 0
in 0
Justice 0
Department 0
(DOJ) 0
custody 0
that 0
March 0
after 0
serving 0
46 0
months 0
in 0
prison 0
for 0
a 0
felony 0
re-entry 0
into 0
the 0
US, 0
but 0
instead 0
of 0
transferring 0
him 0
into 0
the 0
custody 0
of 0
Immigration 0
and 0
Customs 0
Enforcement 0
(ICE) 0
for 0
deportation, 0
the 0
department 0
transferred 0
him 0
to 0
the 0
San 0
Francisco 0
County 0
Jail 0
for 0
prosecution 0
of 0
a 0
1995 0
marijuana 0
charge. 0

San 0

Francisco 0
prosecutors, 0
who 0
had 0
long 0
ago 0
deprioritized 0
marijuana 0
charges, 0
dismissed 0
the 0
decades-old 0
charge 0
and 0
released 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
on 0
April 0
15, 0
2015. 0

Due 0
to 0
San 0
Francisco's 0
policy 0
of 0
limiting 0
cooperation 0
with 0
federal 0
immigration 0
authorities 0
— 0
which 0
some 0
refer 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
"sanctuary" 1
policy 1
— 0
the 0
city 0
did 0
not 0
inform 0
ICE 0
when 0
they 0
released 0
Garcia 0
Zarate. 0

As 0

a 0
result 0
of 0
the 0
case, 0
both 0
the 0
DOJ 0
and 0
the 0
city 0
of 0
San 0
Francisco 0
have 0
changed 0
several 0
policies. 0

The 0
DOJ 0
announced 0
in 0
2016 0
it 0
would 0
no 0
longer 0
release 0
potentially 0
deportable 0
detainees 0
to 0
local 0
jails 0
without 0
first 0
allowing 0
ICE 0
to 0
take 0
custody. 0

San 0
Francisco, 0
meanwhile, 0
has 0
adjusted 0
its 0
policy 0
to 0
notify 0
ICE 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
releasing 0
suspected 0
undocumented 0
immigrants 0
who 0
face 0
charges 0
of 0
serious 0
or 0
violent 0
felonies. 0

"This 1

tragedy 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
prevented 1
if 1
San 1
Francisco 1
had 1
simply 1
turned 1
the 1
alien 1
over 1
to 1
ICE 1
as 1
we 1
requested, 1
instead 1
of 1
releasing 1
him 1
back 1
onto 1
the 1
streets," 1
ICE 0
Director 0
Thomas 0
Homan 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

"It 0
is 0
unconscionable 0
that 0
politicians 1
across 1
this 1
country 1
continue 1
to 1
endanger 1
the 1
lives 1
of 1
Americans 1
with 1
sanctuary 1
policies 1
while 1
ignoring 1
the 1
harm 1
inflicted 1
on 1
their 1
constituents." 1

But 0

ICE 0
has 0
faced 0
criticism 0
of 0
its 0
own 0
over 0
not 0
seeking 0
a 0
judicial 0
warrant 0
to 0
legally 0
obtain 0
custody 0
of 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
when 0
it 0
discovered 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
transferred 0
into 0
San 0
Francisco's 0
custody. 0

The 0
agency 0
has 0
argued 0
that 0
obtaining 0
judicial 0
warrants 0
are 0
unnecessary 0
and 0
would 0
place 0
too 0
much 0
burden 0
on 0
ICE 0
officials 0
and 0
federal 0
courts. 0

Though 0

the 0
agency 0
did 0
issue 0
a 0
request 0
to 0
the 0
city 0
to 0
detain 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
until 0
ICE 0
officials 0
could 0
pick 0
him 0
up, 0
their 0
detainer 0
requests 0
are 0
not 0
signed 0
by 0
a 0
judge 0
and 0
are 0
therefore 0
not 0
legally 0
binding. 0

San 0
Francisco's 0
policy 0
is 0
to 0
ignore 0
such 0
requests 0
if 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
accompanied 0
by 0
judge-signed 0
warrants, 0
and 0
the 0
city 0
has 0
cited 0
federal 0
court 0
cases 0
concluding 0
that 0
such 0
detentions 0
violate 0
inmates' 0
Fourth 0
Amendment 0
rights. 0

Garcia 0

Zarate's 0
deportation 0
and 0
criminal 0
history 0
made 0
him 0
an 0
effective 0
target 0
for 0
immigration 0
hardliners, 0
who 0
argued 0
that 0
Steinle 1
would 1
still 1
be 1
alive 1
were 1
it 1
not 1
for 1
an 1
insecure 1
border 1
and 1
lenient 1
treatment 1
toward 1
suspected 1
undocumented 1
immigrants 1
in 1
local 1
jails. 1

President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
immediately 0
seized 0
on 0
the 0
verdict 0

also 0

that 0

previously 0

crimes 0
and 0
had 0

this 0

travesty 1
of 1

tweeted. 0

In 0

fact, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
had 0
never 0
been 0
convicted 0
of 0
a 0
violent 0
crime 0
before 0
Steinle's 0
shooting 0
— 0
his 0
previous 0
convictions 0
were 0
for 0
nonviolent 0
drug 0
crimes 0
and 0
illegal 0
entry. 0

Lax 0
border 0
security, 0
too, 0
does 0
not 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
factor 0
since 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
was 0
caught 0

each 0
time 0
he 0
entered 0
the 0

under 0

In 0

contrast, 0
Steinle's 0
family 0
has 0
expressed 0
nuanced 0
views 0
on 0
immigration 0
and 0
"sanctuary" 0

They 0
have 0
both 0
condemned 0

for 0
"sensationalizing" 0
Steinle's 0
death 0
to 0

expressed 0

28, 0
tried 0
to 0
join 0
the 0
U.S. 0

and 0

And 0
in 1
the 1
application 1

he 1
lied 1
to 1

about 1
a 1
recent 1

he'd 1
taken 1
to 1

in 1

pleaded 0

Thursday 0
in 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Court 0
to 0
two 0
counts 0
of 0
making 0

He 0
faces 0
up 0
to 0
15 0
years 0
in 0
prison 0
when 0
sentenced 0
June 0
4. 0

According 0
to 0
court 0
documents 0
and 0
prosecutors, 0
Patel 0
– 0
who 0
was 0
raised 0
Hindu 0
before 0
converting 0
to 0
Islam 0
several 0
years 0
ago 0
– 0
traveled 0
to 0
China 0
in 0
July 0
2016 0
to 0
teach 0
English. 0

While 0
there, 0
however, 0
he 0
grew 0
displeased 0
with 0
how 0
that 0
country 0
treated 0
Muslims. 0

His 0
employer 0
arranged 0
for 0
Patel 0
to 0
fly 0
back 0
to 0
Virginia 0
on 0
Aug. 0
23, 0
2016, 0
but 0
instead 0
Patel 0
chose 0
to 0
travel 0
to 0
Jordan, 0
a 0
statement 0
of 0
facts 0
filed 0
with 0
his 0
plea 0
agreement 0
said. 0

Jordanian 0
officials 0
arrested 0
Patel 0
a 0
few 0
days 0
later. 0

It's 0
unclear 0
why, 0
but 0
court 0
documents 0
say 0
Patel 0
told 0
taxi 0
drivers 0
and 0
others 0
in 0
Jordan 0
that 0
he 0
supported 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State. 0

A 0
search 0
of 0
Patel's 0
computer 0
also 0
showed 0
he 0
researched 0
how 0
to 0
join 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State 0
before 0
he 0
left 0
for 0
China. 0

Jordanian 0
officials 0
moved 0
for 0
Patel's 0
deportation. 0

On 0
Sept. 0
2, 0
2016, 0
he 0
boarded 0
a 0
flight 0
to 0
Chicago, 0
and 0
the 0
next 0
day, 0
he 0
flew 0
to 0
Detroit. 0

There, 0
he 0
met 0
an 0
FBI 0
source 0
and 0
started 0
talking 0
about 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State. 0

He 0
explained 0
he 0
went 0
to 0
Jordan 0
in 0
part 0
to 0
find 0
like-minded 0
Muslims, 0
and 0
because 0
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
do 1
something 1
“bigger, 1
better, 1
and 1
more 1
purposeful” 1
– 1
like 1
dying 1
in 1
the 1
cause 1
of 1
Allah. 1

But, 0
he 0
said, 0
he 0
was 0
afraid 0
of 0
making 0
his 0
parents 0
sad. 0

In 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
their 0
conversations, 0
Patel 0
discussed 0
his 0
desire 0
to 0
see 0
a 1
holy 1
war 1
between 1
Muslims 1
and 1
non-Muslims. 1

He 1
also 1
sang 1
an 1
Islamic 1
State 1
fight 1
song 1
and 1
recalled 1
making 1
a 1
replica 1
of 1
the 1
group’s 1
flag. 1

He 1
said 1
he 1
wanted 1
to 1
replace 1
his 1
neighbor’s 1
American 1
flag 1
with 1
it. 1

Patel 0
returned 0
to 0
Williamsburg 0
on 0
Sept. 0
6, 0
2016. 0

Shortly 0
thereafter, 0
he 0
moved 0
into 0
a 0
motel 0
his 0
parents 0
owned 0
and 0
started 0
applying 0
for 0
jobs 0
with 0
the 0
military, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
some 0
paramilitary 0
organizations 0
– 0
like 0
police 0
and 0
fire 0
departments, 0
correctional 0
facilities 0
and 0
probation 0
offices. 0

While 0
back 0
in 0
Virginia, 0
Patel 0
stayed 0
in 0
touch 0
with 0
the 0
FBI 0
source. 0

He 0
texted 0
the 0
source 0
on 0
Sept. 0
23, 0
2016, 0
and 0
expressed 0
support 0
for 0
Maj. 0
Nidal 0
Hasan, 0
who 0
killed 0
13 0
soldiers 0
in 0
2009 0
while 0
serving 0
at 0
Fort 0
Hood. 0

In 1
the 1
process, 1
however, 1
he 1
misidentified 1
Hasan 1
as 1
Nidal 1
Hussein 1
and 1
said 1
the 1
shooting 1
happened 1
at 1
Fort 1
Knox 1
in 1
Kentucky. 1

He 1
also 1
said 1
Hasan 1
had 1
died 1
a 1
martyr, 1
though 1
in 1
fact 1
he 1
remains 1
alive 1
on 1
military 1
death 1
row. 1

Court 0
documents 0
show 0
Patel 0
began 0
saying 0
in 0
late 0
2016 0
that 0
he 0
did 0
not 0
actually 0
support 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State. 0

Simply 0
expressing 0
support 0
for 0
a 0
terrorist 0
organization 0
or 0
attack 0
is 0
not 0
against 0
the 0
law. 0

Patel's 0
crime 0
was 0
failing 0
to 0
disclose 0
his 0
trips 0
to 0
Jordan 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
join 0
the 0
Army 0
and 0
Air 0
Force 0
in 0
December 0
2016 0
and 0
January 0
2017. 0

Court 0
documents 0
say 0
Patel 0
lied 0
about 0
his 0
travel 0
history, 0
saying 0
his 0
only 0
time 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
country 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
seven 0
years 0
was 0
a 0
family 0
trip 0
to 0
India 0
in 0
2011 0
and 0
2012. 0

Before 0
Patel 0
signed 0
the 0
Army 0
application, 0
a 0
recruiter 0
asked 0
him 0
specifically 0
about 0
the 0
travel 0
question 0
and 0
reminded 0
him 0
providing 0
false 0
information 0
could 0
result 0
in 0
criminal 0
charges. 0

During 0
the 0
interview, 0
the 0
recruiter 0
asked 0
to 0
see 0
Patel's 0
passport 0
to 0
confirm 0
his 0
travel 0
claims. 0

Patel 1
agreed 1
to 1
bring 1
it 1
by, 1
but 1
two 1
days 1
later 1
he 1
told 1
the 1
State 1
Department 1
he 1
had 1
accidentally 1
thrown 1
it 1
away 1
in 1
October 1
and 1
needed 1
a 1
new 1
one. 1

After 0
Patel's 0
arrest 0
in 0
July, 0
investigators 0
found 0
his 0
passport 0
"near" 0
the 0
motel 0
room 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
living, 0

"With 0

"This 1

Schiff 0

The 0

WASHINGTON 0

On 0
an 0

mission 0
to 0
resolve 0
a 0
diplomatic 0
crisis, 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Michael 0
R. 0
Pompeo 0
held 0
delicate 0
talks 0
Tuesday 0
with 0
the 0
rulers 0
of 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
amid 0
growing 0
suspicions 0
that 0
a 0
Virginia-based 0
Saudi 0
columnist 0
was 0
killed 0
on 0
their 0
orders. 0

Pompeo 0
did 0
not 0
report 0
any 0
progress 0
following 0
a 0
day 0
of 0
meetings 0
in 0
Riyadh 0
with 0
Saudi 0
King 0
Salman 0
and 0
his 0
powerful 0
son, 0
Crown 0
Prince 0
Mohammed 0
bin 0
Salman, 0
the 0
country’s 0
de 0

ruler. 0

President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
on 0
Monday 0
ordered 0
Pompeo 0
to 0
rush 1
to 0
the 0
desert 0
kingdom 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
fate 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
journalist, 0
Jamal 0
Khashoggi, 0
and 0
the 0
diplomat 0
quickly 0
hopped 1
a 0
plane. 0

In 0
his 0
meetings, 0
Pompeo 0
conveyed 0
“U.S. 0

concern” 0
about 0
Khashoggi’s 0
disappearance 0
two 0
weeks 0
ago, 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
said, 0
and 0
stressed 0
“the 0
importance 0
of 0
a 0
thorough, 0
transparent, 0
and 0
timely 0
investigation.” 0

The 0
talks 0
were 0
“direct 0
and 0
candid,” 0
State 0
Department 0
spokeswoman 0
Heather 0
Nauert 0
said. 0

Pompeo 0
reminded 0
his 0
hosts 0
that 0
despite 0
the 0
numerous 0
bilateral 0
issues 0
the 0
two 0
governments 0
share, 0
determining 0
Khashoggi’s 0
fate 0
was 0
the 0
urgent 0
purpose 0
of 0
this 0
trip, 0
she 0
said. 0

Khashoggi, 0
a 0
prominent 0
critic 0
of 0
the 0
autocratic 0
Saudi 0
leadership, 0
was 0
last 0
seen 0
entering 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Consulate 0
in 0
Istanbul, 0
Turkey, 0
on 0
Oct. 0
2, 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
seeking 0
papers 0
to 0
marry 0
his 0
fiancée. 0

Turkish 0
media 0
reports, 0
based 0
in 0
part 0
on 0
apparent 0
audio 0
recordings, 0
have 0
said 0
Khashoggi 0
was 0
beaten 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
then 1
dismembered 1
in 0
the 0
building. 0

A 0
15-member 0
Saudi 0
military 0
team 0
had 0
entered 0
the 0
consulate 0
with 0
a 0
bone 0
saw 0
shortly 0
before 0
Khashoggi 0
arrived, 0
and 0
flew 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
country 0
soon 0
after, 0
the 0
reports 0
said. 0

Saudi 0
officials 0
insisted 0
that 0
Khashoggi 0
left 0
the 0
consulate 0
but 0
have 0
provided 0
no 0
video 0
or 0
other 0
evidence. 0

They 0
have 0
denied 0
any 0
responsibility 0
for 0
his 0
disappearance. 0

Hoping 0
to 0
stem 0
a 0
growing 0
furor, 0
Trump 0
on 0
Monday 0
suggested 0
“rogue 0
killers,” 0
not 0
the 0
Saudi 0
royal 0
family, 0
may 0
have 0
carried 0
out 0
the 0
murder. 0

Critics 0
quickly 0
said 0
that 0
Trump 0
was 0
providing 0
an 0
excuse 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
leaders, 0
and 0
participating 0
in 0
a 0
cover-up. 0

That 0
seemed 0
to 0
set 0
the 0
stage 0
for 0
Saudi 0
officials 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
explain 0
away 0
the 0
alleged 0
shocking 1
death. 1

They 0
floated 0
the 0
idea 0
later 0
Monday 0
of 0
claiming 0
that 0
Khashoggi, 0
who 0
wrote 0
opinion 0
pieces 0
for 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
Arab 0
media, 0
was 0
accidentally 0
killed 0
in 0
an 0
interrogation 0
gone 0
awry 0
inside 0
the 0
consulate 0
— 0
supposedly 0
without 0
the 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
king 0
or 0
crown 0
prince. 0

Publicly, 0
Pompeo 0
and 0
his 0
hosts 0
looked 0
calm 0
and 0
friendly 0
when 0
they 0
met 0
Tuesday 0
in 0
Riyadh. 0

At 0
one 0
point, 0
as 0
they 0
greeted 0
each 0
other, 0
Prince 0
Mohammed 0
noted 0
the 0
two 0
countries 0
were 0
important 0
allies. 0

“Absolutely,” 0
Pompeo 0
said, 0
smiling. 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
long 0
guaranteed 0
Saudi 0
security 0
in 0
exchange 0
for 0
a 0
steady 0
supply 0
of 0
oil. 0

Those 0
ties 0
have 0
frayed 0
even 0
as 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
embraced 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers 0
as 0
a 0
crucial 0
regional 0
ally 0
in 0
efforts 0
to 0
constrain 0
Iran 0
and 0
to 0
craft 0
a 0
peace 0
plan 0
between 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Palestinians. 0

The 0
current 0
crisis 0
has 0
put 0
those 0
broader 0
goals 0
at 0
risk, 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
scrambled 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
face-saving 0
solution 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers. 0

Trump 0
has 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
impose 0
“severe” 1
punishment 0
if 0
proof 0
emerges 0
that 0
Saudi 0
rulers 0
sanctioned 0
Khashoggi’s 0
murder, 0
but 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
said 0
what 0
that 0
would 0
entail. 0

He 0
has 0
ruled 0
out 0
cancelling 0
or 0
suspending 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
arms 0
deals 0
with 0
the 0
oil-rich 0
country. 0

Many 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
have 0
demanded 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
take 0
tougher 0
actions, 0
including 0
punitive 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Saudi 0
rulers. 0

But 0
Congress 0
has 0
taken 0
no 0
action 0
on 0
its 0
own. 0

of 0
American 0

and 0
in 0
the 0

are 0
still 0

In 0
other 0
words, 0
Trump 0
has 0
not 0
even 0
begun 0
to 0
repair 0
the 0
damage 0
done 0
by 0
eight 0
years 0
of 0
Obama. 0

Native-born 0
American 0
workers 0
lost 0
ground 0
to 0
their 0
foreign-born 0
competitors 0
throughout 0
the 0
Obama 0
years. 0

And, 0
shown 0
above, 0
this 0
trend 0
accelerated 0
significantly 0
in 0
the 0
months 0
leading 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
election. 0

While 0
May 0
was 0
a 1
welcome 1
respite, 1
Trump 0
supporters 0
have 0
reason 0
to 0
complain: 0
Since 0
taking 0
office 0
in 0
January 0
2017 0
President 0
Trump 0
has 0
presided 0
over 0
a 0
labor 0
market 0
in 0
which 0
immigrants 0
have 0
gained 0
1.006 0
million 0
jobs, 0
a 0
3.9% 0
increase, 0
while 0
native-born 0
Americans 0
gained 0
about 0
2.4 0
million 0
jobs 0
—a 0
rise 0
of 0
only 0
1.9%. 0

As 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
labor 0
market 0
is 0
concerned, 0
“America 1
First” 1
has 0
not 0
translated 0
to 0
Americans 0
First. 0

In 0
normal 0
times, 0
this 0
might 0
be 0
a 0
big 0
story. 0

But 0
the 0
even 0
the 1
conservative 1
non-Main 1
Stream 1
Media 1
is 0
currently 0
too 1
steeped 1
in 1
economic 1
euphoria 1
to 0
notice. 0

Nd 0
anyway, 0
they 0
almost 0
never 0
report 0
the 0
immigration 0
dimension. 0

However, 0
it 0
is 0
now 0
absolutely 0
clear 0
that 0
immigration, 0
and 0
immigrant 0
displacement 0
of 0
American 0
workers, 0
cannot 0
be 0
jawboned 1
away. 1

The 1
only 1
answer 1
is 1
legislation— 1
border 1
wall 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
illegal 1
alien 1
flow; 1
a 1
second 1
Operation 1
Wetback, 1
including 1
E-Verify, 1
to 1
get 1
the 1
illegal 1
alien 1
self-deporting; 1
a 1
moratorium 1
on 1
legal 1
immigration. 1

May 0
2018 0
was 0
the 0
fifth 0
consecutive 0
month 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
foreign-born 0
working 0
age 0
population 0
(including 0
illegals) 0
grew 0
by 0
more 0
than 0
1 0
million 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
month 0
the 0
prior 0
year. 0

But 0
May’s 0
growth 0
was 0
less 0
than 0
that 0
in 0
April 0
and 0
March, 0
possibly 0
an 0
emerging 0
trend. 0

Can't 0
render, 0
error 0

In 0
May 0
2018 0
there 0
were 0
1.342 0
million 0
more 0
working-age 0
immigrants 0
than 0
in 0
May 0
2017. 0

This 0
comes 1
on 1
the 1
heels 1
of 1
gains 1
of 0
2.154 0
million 0
and 0
1.597 0
million. 0

year-over-year, 0
in 0
March 0
and 0
April, 0
respectively. 0

It’s 0
hard 0
to 0
believe 0
with 1
the 1
evaporation 1
of 0
the 1
Trump 1
Effect, 1
but 0
less 0
than 0
six 0
months 0
ago 0
we 0
were 0
seeing 0
to 0
year-over-year 0
declines 0
in 0
the 0
immigrant 0
workforce 0
population. 0

The 0
last 0
five 0
months 0
of 0
2017 0
saw 0
the 0
foreign-born 0
population 0
fall 0
by 0
an 0
average 0
100,000 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
month 0
of 0
the 0
prior 0
year 0
(shown 0
in 0
red 0
on 0
our 0
chart). 0

These 0
are 0
net 0
figures. 0

Over 0
a 0
12-month 0
period 0
an 0
average 0
of 0
perhaps 0
300,000 0
immigrants 0
die 0
and 0
an 0
equal 0
number 0
leave 0
the 0
U.S. 0
voluntarily. 0

So 0
the 0
1.342 0
million 0
net 0
rise 0
in 0
foreign-born 0
population, 0
May 0
2017 0
to 0
May 0
2018, 0
implies 0
that 0
nearly 0
2 0
million 0
foreign-born 0
individuals 0
may 0
have 0
actually 0
settled 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
over 0
those 0
12 0
months. 0

(This 0
excludes 0
tourists 0
and 0
other 0
short-term 0
entrants.) 0

In 0
percentage 0
terms, 0
the 0
immigrant 0
working-age 0
population 0
grew 0
3.24% 0
over 0
the 0
12 0
months. 0

If 0
this 0
growth 0
rate 0
persists, 0
it 0
portends 0
a 0
doubling 0
in 0
22 0
years. 0

By 0
contrast, 0
the 0
native-born 0
American 0
population 0
rose 0
0.63% 0
over 0
this 0
period 0
—a 0
rate 0
that 0
will 0
require 0
114 0
years 0
for 0
a 0
doubling. 0

If 0
both 0
rates 0
persist 0
that 0
long, 0
the 1
term 1
“native 1
born” 1
will 1
refer 1
to 1
a 1
minuscule 1
fraction 1

the 1
U.S. 1

Coverup? 0

Rep. 0
Ron 0
DeSantis 0
(R-FL) 0
accuses 0
the 0
Republican 0
House 0
leadership 0
of 0
dragging 0
their 0
heels 0
in 0
the 0
Spygate 0
investigation. 0

This 0
has 0
been 0
evident 0
for 0
months 0
now, 0
as 0
there 0
are 0
many 0
connections 0
and 0
obvious 0
questions 0
that 0
haven’t 0
been 0
investigated. 0

The 0
FBI 0
files 0
contain 0
memos 0
that 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
scoured 0
too. 0

The 0
House 0
leaders 0
are 0
Paul 0
Ryan 0
(Speaker 0
of 0
the 0
House), 0
Kevin 0
McCarthy 0
(Majority 0
Leader), 0
Steve 0
Scalise 0
(Majority 0
Whip) 0
and 0
Cathy 0
McMorris 0
Rodgers 0
(House 0
Republican 0
Conference 0
Chair). 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
decided 0
lack 0
of 0
aggressiveness 0
of 0
this 0
investigation. 0

One 0
source 0
is 0
Paul 0
Ryan: 0
Evidence: 0
“House 0
Speaker 0
Paul 0
Ryan 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
Oversight 0
Chairman 0
Trey 0
Gowdy 0
was 0
‘accurate’ 0
when 0
he 0
argued 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
acted 0
appropriately 0
in 0
its 0
ongoing 0
probe 0
of 0
potential 0
Russian 0
links 0
to 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign.” 0
How 1
could 1
Ryan 1
possibly 1
know 1
this? 1

Isn’t 1
he 1
prejudging 1
the 1
case 1
without 1
even 1
finding 1
out 1
what 1
actually 1
happened? 1

If 0
Ryan 0
is 0
correct, 0
an 0
investigation 0
will 0
show 0
it; 0
but 0
the 0
current 0
evidence 0
suggests 0
he 0
is 0
wrong. 0

By 0
short-circuiting 0
the 0
investigation, 0
Ryan 0
is 0
betraying 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
to 0
learn 0
what 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
CIA 0
actually 0
did 0
against 0
Trump. 0

Another 0
Republican 0
who 0
wants 0
to 0
stop 0
investigating 0
is 0
former 0
RNC 0
Chair, 0
Michael 0
Steele: 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
Spygate 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
spies 0
in 0
the 0
campaign.” 0
The 0
attitude 0
of 0
Steve 0
Scalise 0
is 0
wishy-washy. 1

He’s 0
open 0
to 0
a 0
special 0
prosecutor, 0
but 0
his 0
responses 0
come 0
across 0
as 0
passive, 0
lacking 1
push, 1
zeal 1
and 1
enthusiasm 1
to 0
delve 0
deeply 0
into 0
Spygate. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
coverup 0
at 0
work 0
here 0
in 0
which 0
important 0
Republicans 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
bolster 0
Trump 0
by 0
adding 0
substance 0
to 0
Spygate, 0
and 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
clean 0
up 0
the 0
FBI 0
by 0
aggressively 0
investigating 0
Spygate 0
further. 0

They 0
don’t 0
want 0
the 1
rotten 1
inner 1
workings 1
of 0
the 0
organization 0
to 0
be 0
aired 0
publicly. 0

They 1
want 1
to 1
preserve 1
the 1
FBI’s 1
reputation. 1

They 1
don’t 1
care 1
to 1
see 1
Trump 1
vindicated. 1

The 0
contrast 0
with 0
the 0
Watergate 0
investigation 0
and 0
hearings 0
is 0
startling. 1

the 0
story 0
about 0
how 0
their 0

Abel. 0

“That 0

one 0
was 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
of 0
a 0
surprise,” 0
Trenton 0
said 0
as 0
he 0
sat 0
with 0
his 0
parents, 0
Brett 0
and 0
Courtney 0
Tolliver, 0
one 0
day 0
this 0
month 0
watching 0
his 0
little 0
sister’s 0
soccer 0
practice 0
on 0
a 0
lush 0
field 0
in 0
this 0
small 0
town 0
in 0
the 0
mountains 0
of 0
southern 0
West 0
Virginia. 0

This 0

spring, 0
Bible 0
classes 0
such 0
as 0
Trenton’s 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
many 0
here 0
in 0
Mercer 0
County. 0

For 0
decades, 0
the 0
county’s 0
public 0
schools 0
have 0
offered 0
a 0
weekly 0
Bible 0
class 0
during 0
the 0
school 0
day 0
— 0
30 0
minutes 0
at 0
the 0
elementary 0
level 0
and 0
45 0
minutes 0
in 0
middle 0
school. 0

Bible 0
classes 0
on 0
school 0
time 0
are 0
a 0
rarity 0
in 0
public 0
education, 0
but 0
here 0
they 0
are 0
a 0
long-standing 0
tradition. 0

The 0
program 0
is 0
not 0
mandatory, 0
but 0
almost 0
every 0
child 0
in 0
the 0
district 0
attends. 0

And 0
there 0
is 0
widespread 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
classes: 0
Parents 0
and 0
community 0
members 0
help 0
raise 0
nearly 0
$500,000 0
a 0
year 0
to 0
pay 0
for 0
the 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools 0
program. 0

Now 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools 0
is 0
facing 0
a 0
stiff 0
legal 0
challenge. 0

Two 0
county 0
residents 0
with 0
school-age 0
children 0
argue 0
in 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
that 0
the 0
program 0
violates 0
the 0
establishment 0
clause 0
of 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
and 0
the 0
West 0
Virginia 0
constitution. 0

Filed 0
in 0
January 0
and 0
amended 0
last 0
month 0
by 0
the 0
Freedom 0
From 0
Religion 0
Foundation, 0
the 0
suit 0
charges 0
that 0
the 0
Bible 0
class 0
“advances 0
and 0
endorses 0
one 0
religion, 0
improperly 0
entangles 0
public 0
schools 0
in 0
religious 0
affairs, 0
and 0
violates 0
the 0
personal 0
consciences 0
of 0
nonreligious 0
and 0
non-Christian 0
parents 0
and 0
students.” 0

Supporters 0

are 0
adamant 0
that 0
the 0
weekly 0
class 0
is 0
an 0
elective 0
meant 0
to 0
explore 0
the 0
history 0
and 0
literature 0
of 0
the 0
Bible, 0
not 0
to 0
promote 0
religious 0
belief. 0

“My 0
experience 0
with 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
very 0
positive. 0

I’ve 0
never 0
known 0
of 0
anyone 0
who 0
has 0
been 0
pressured 0
or 0
felt 0
ostracized,” 0
said 0
the 0
Rev. 0

David 0
W. 0
Dockery, 0
senior 0
pastor 0
at 0
First 0
Baptist 0
Church 0
of 0
Princeton. 0

“Any 0
time 0
God’s 0
word 0
can 0
be 0
proclaimed 0
is 0
beneficial 1
and 0
is 0
a 1
good 1
thing.” 1

Trenton’s 0

parents 0
also 0
find 0
it 0
hard 0
to 0
see 0
why 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
objections. 0

“I 0

think 0
it’s 0
a 0
great 0
program 0
mainly 0
because 0
it’s 0
the 0
only 0
chance 0
for 0
some 0
of 0
these 0
kids 0
to 0
even 0
see 0
the 0
Bible,” 0
said 0
Brett 0
Tolliver, 0
27. 0

“More 0
importantly, 0
I 0
don’t 0
know 0
who 0
it 0
harms. 0

The 0
kids 0
aren’t 0
forced 0
to 0
be 0
there.” 0

Courtney 0

Tolliver, 0
26, 0
a 0
teacher 0
in 0
the 0
district, 0
agrees. 0

“It’s 0

not 0
teaching 0
religion, 0
but 0
it 0
teaches 0
character 0
and 0
respect 0
and 0
how 0
important 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
tell 0
the 0
truth,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“The 0
kids 0
love 0
it 0
and 0
the 0
ones 0
who 0
don’t 0
participate 0
aren’t 0
made 0
to 0
feel 0
left 0
out.” 0

But 0

the 0
plaintiffs 0
in 0
the 0
suit 0
and 0
their 0
backers 0
argue 0
that 0
the 0
program’s 0
popularity 0
shouldn’t 0
matter 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
rulings 0
such 0
as 0
McCollum 0
v. 0
Board 0
of 0
Education 0
in 0
1948 0
that 0
have 0
banned 0
public 0
schools 0
from 0
initiating 0
or 0
sponsoring 0
religious 0
activity. 0

The 0
suit 0
alleges 0
that 0
the 0
lessons 0
in 0
the 0
Mercer 0
schools 0
are 0
similar 0
to 0
what 0
a 0
child 0
would 0
hear 0
in 0
Sunday 0
school 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
advocate 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments 0
and 0
treat 0
stories 0
in 0
the 0
Bible 0
as 0
historical 0
fact. 0

The 0
suit 0
quotes 0
from 0
one 0
lesson: 0
“If 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
Israelites 0
had 0
chosen 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments, 0
think 0
of 0
how 0
safe 0
and 0
happy 0
they 0
would 0
have 0
been.” 0
Another 0
lesson 0
asks 0
students 0
to 0
imagine 0
that 0
humans 0
and 0
dinosaurs 0
existed 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time. 0

It 0
says: 0
“So 0
picture 0
Adam 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
crawl 0
up 0
on 0
the 0
back 0
of 0
a 0
dinosaur! 0

He 0
and 0
Eve 0
could 0
have 0
their 0
own 0
personal 0
water 0
slide! 0

Wouldn’t 0
that 0
be 0
so 0
wild!” 0

The 0

district 0
declined 0
a 0
request 0
to 0
observe 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
classes. 0

Elizabeth 0
Deal, 0
who 0
describes 0
herself 0
as 0
agnostic, 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
plaintiffs 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

Her 0
daughter 0
attended 0
elementary 0
school 0
in 0
nearby 0
Bluefield, 0
but 0
Deal 0
kept 0
her 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
Bible 0
class. 0

Even 0
though 0
the 0
class 0
was 0
optional, 0
Deal 0
said 0
there 0
weren’t 0
any 0
alternative 0
lessons 0
or 0
activities 0
for 0
those 0
who 0
opted 0
out. 0

Her 0
daughter 0
was 0
told 0
to 0
sit 0
in 0
the 0
computer 0
lab 0
for 0
that 0
half-hour 0
and 0
read 0
a 0
book. 0

Bypassing 1
the 1
class 1
left 1
her 1
vulnerable 1
to 1
bullying. 1

Deal 0
said 0
other 0
students 0
told 0
her 0
daughter 0
that 0
she 0
was 0
going 1
to 1
hell. 1

One 0
day 0
a 0
student 0
saw 0
her 0
daughter 0
reading 0
a 0
“Harry 0
Potter” 0
novel 0
and 0
told 0
her, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
mother: 0
“You 1
don’t 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
reading 1
this. 1

You 1
need 1
to 1
be 1
reading 1
the 1
Bible.” 1

Eventually 0

Deal 0
moved 0
her 0
daughter 0
to 0
a 0
public 0
school 0
a 0
few 0
miles 0
away 0
in 0
Virginia 0
where 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
Bible 0
class. 0

She 0
pays 0
an 0
out-of-state 0
fee 0
of 0
several 0
hundred 0
dollars, 0
but 0
she 0
no 0
longer 0
worries 0
about 0
her 0
child 0
being 0
taunted. 0

Deal 0

said 0
she 0
joined 0
the 0
suit 0
because 0
she 0
believes 0
strongly 1
in 0
the 0
separation 0
of 0
church 0
and 0
state. 0

“When 0
something 0
is 0
wrong,” 0
she 0
said, 0
“you 0
have 0
to 0
stand 0
up 0
against 0
it.” 0

God 0
is 0
a 0
big 0
deal 0
in 0
Mercer 0
County, 0
home 0
to 0
about 0
125 0
churches 0
that 0
dominate 0
the 0
main 0
streets 0
of 0
its 0
biggest 0

Princeton 0
(population 0
6,400) 0

such 0
as 0
Athens 0
(1,000), 0
Bramwell 0
(360) 0
and 0
Oakvale 0
(120). 0

A 0
lot 0
of 0
the 0
good 0
jobs 0
in 0
the 0
county 0
have 0
left 0
— 0
22 0
percent 0
of 0
its 0
61,000 0
residents 0
live 0
below 0
the 0
poverty 0
level 0
— 0
but 0
the 0
churches 0
have 0
stayed. 0

You 0
can 0
find 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
God 0
here. 0

And 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
Christ. 0

And 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
Jesus. 0

There 0
are 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
Catholic 0
churches, 0
a 0
synagogue 0
and 0
a 0
mosque, 0
but 0
the 0
vast 0
majority 0
of 0
houses 0
of 0
worship 0
are 0
Baptist, 0
Methodist 0

The 0

the 0

with 0
gospel 0

The 0

been 0
the 0

at 0
the 0
Church 0

for 0
more 0
than 0

The 0

in 0

can 0
hold 0
up 0
to 0
2,000 0
people 0
for 0
Sunday 0
services 0
and 0
often 0
does. 0

For 0
Hurt, 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0
Schools, 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
public 0
schools 0
here 0
in 0
one 0
form 0
or 0
another 0
since 0
1939, 0
is 0
simply 0
a 0
way 0
for 0
students 0
to 0
further 0
their 0
knowledge. 0

“There 0

is 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
not 0
just 0
poetry 0
and 0
prose 0
in 0

read 0
almost 0
every 0
piece 0
of 0
history 0
that’s 0
in 0
the 0

been 0

he 0
said. 0

“We 0
see 0
the 0
Bible 0
not 0
just 0
as 0
a 0
book 0
of 0
faith 0
but 0
as 0
a 0
pretty 0
accurate 0
account 0
of 0
history 0
that 0
informs 0
us 0
about 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
things 0
that 0
happened.” 0

Hurt, 0

whose 0
son, 0
the 0
Rev. 0

J.B. 0
Hurt, 0
is 0
also 0
a 0
minister 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
of 0
God 0
and 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
county 0
school 0
board, 0
says 0
he 0
would 0
oppose 0
the 0
program 0
if 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
being 0
used 0
to 0
teach 0
religion 0
or 0
if 0
students 0
were 0
required 0
to 0
take 0
the 0
class. 0

But 0
he 0
also 0
embraces 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
the 0
Bible 0
offers 0
irrefutable 0
lessons 0
in 0
morality 0
and 0
teaches 0
the 0
difference 0
between 0
right 0
and 0
wrong. 0

“If 0

you 0
read 0
the 0
Bible, 0
you’re 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
whole 0
lot 0
of 0
good 0

that 0
are 0
going 0
to 0
stick 0
with 0
you 0

make 0
you 0
a 0
better 0

he 0
said. 0

“You 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0

it. 0

It 0
speaks 0
for 0
itself 0
in 0
terms 0

ethics 0
and 0
those 0

The 0

that 0
a 0
weekly 0
Bible 0

for 0
6,600 0
students 0
in 0
16 0
public 0
elementary 0

a 0
former 0
two-term 0
school 0
board 0
member 0
and 0
mother 0
of 0
two 0
sons 0
who 0
went 0
through 0
Mercer 0
schools. 0

“As 0

a 0

person 0
of 0
faith 0
myself, 0
I 0
don’t 0
see 0
any 0
problem 0
with 0
having 0
an 0
after-school 0
Bible 0
program,” 0
White 0
said. 0

“But 0
to 0
me 0
this 0
seems 0
a 0
pretty 1
clear 1
violation 0
of 0
the 0
Constitution.” 0

White 0

holds 0
the 0
school 0
board 0
and 0
leadership 0
responsible 0
for 0
spreading 0
what 0
she 0
says 0
is 0
a 0
false 0
sense 0
of 0
what 0
the 0
Bible 0
in 0
the 0

is 0
and 0
does. 0

In 0

a 0
commentary 0
for 0
the 0
Charleston 0
Gazette-Mail, 0
White 0
wrote 0
that 0
“the 0

She 0

argued 0
that 0
the 0
classes 0
are 0
character 0
education 0
based 0
on 0
biblical 0
values, 0
that 0
they 0
were 0

electives 0
because 0
West 0

doesn’t 0
offer 0
electives 0
in 0
elementary 0

and 0
that 0
even 0
though 0
the 0
classes 0
are 0
funded 0
by 0
private 0
donations, 0
that 0
doesn’t 0
mean 0
they 0
should 0
be 0
taught 0
during 0
the 0
instructional 0
day. 0

She 0
also 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
untrue 0
that 0
children 0
who 0
didn’t 0
take 0
the 0
class 0
weren’t 0
made 0
to 0
“feel 0
different 0

When 0
White 0
posted 0
the 0
article 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
she 0
heard 0
from 0
some 0
supporters, 0
but 0
many 0

“I 0

objection, 0
it 0
is 0
okay.” 0

But 0

the 0
program’s 0
fate 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
resolved 0
by 0
popular 0
vote 0
or 0
on 0
Facebook 0
posts. 0

Instead, 0
the 0
question 0
will 0
be 0
tried 0
in 0
the 0
courtroom 0
of 0
Judge 0
David 0
A. 0
Faber 0
of 0
the 0
U.S. 0
District 0
Court 0
for 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
West 0
Virginia 0
in 0
Bluefield. 0

(Faber 1

that 0
specializes 0
in 0
religious 0
freedom 0
cases. 0

Hiram 0
Sasser, 0
a 0
lawyer 0
at 0
the 0
firm, 0
said 0
the 0
district’s 0
main 0
objective 0
is 0
to 0
allow 0
the 0
Bible 0
course 0
to 0
remain 0
as 0
an 0
elective 0
while 0
making 0
sure 0
it 0
complies 0
with 0
the 0
law. 0

The 0
district 0
filed 0
a 0
motion 0
to 0
dismiss 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“There 0

are 0
two 0
things 0
to 0
look 0
at,” 0
Sasser 0
said. 0

“The 0
first 0
is 0
whether 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
a 0
Bible 0
course 0
at 0
all. 0

And 0
the 0
other 0
is 0
whether 0
you 0
can 0
have 0
the 0
Bible 0
course 0
as 0
it 0
is 0
presently 0
constituted. 0

It’s 0
fair 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
we’re 0
very 0
confident 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
issue. 0

And 0
on 0
the 0
second 0
issue 0
. 0

. 0

. 0

our 0
client 0
is 0
very, 1
very 1
flexible 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
making 0
sure 0
that 0
the 0
content 0
is 0
in 0
compliance 0
with 0
the 0
law.” 0

But 0

the 0
plaintiffs 0
aren’t 0
looking 0
for 0
flexibility. 0

They 0
want 0
the 0
Bible 0
class 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
school 0
day. 0

The 0
program 0
“is 0
unconstitutional 0
at 0
its 0
core 0
and 0
cannot 0
be 0
saved 0
via 0
modifications,” 0
said 0
Patrick 0
Elliott, 0
a 0
lawyer 0
with 0
the 0
Freedom 0
From 0
Religion 0
Foundation. 0

“There 0
is 0
no 0
legally 0
permissible 0
way 0
for 0
Mercer 0
County 0
Schools 0
to 0
continue 0
with 0
any 0
type 0
of 0
program 0
like 0
this.” 0

According 0

to 0
Elliott, 0
the 0
Mercer 0
program 0
is 0
“extremely 1
rare” 0
and 0
there 0
are 0
only 0
a 0
handful 0
of 0
districts 0
around 0
the 0
country 0
with 0
similar 0
courses. 0

The 0
amended 0
complaint, 0
Elliott 0
said, 0
seeks 0
to 0
prevent 0
the 0
school 0
system 0
from 0
“organizing, 0
administering, 0
or 0
otherwise 0
endorsing 0
Bible 0
classes 0
for 0
Mercer 0
County 0
Schools’ 0
students 0
in 0
grades 0
kindergarten 0
through 0
eighth 0
grade.” 0

Charles 0

C. 0
Haynes, 0
the 0
founding 0
director 0
of 0
the 0
Religious 0
Freedom 0
Center 0
at 0
the 0
Newseum 0
in 0
Washington, 0
doesn’t 0
foresee 0
the 0
program 0
surviving 0
a 0
court 0
challenge 0
in 0
its 0
current 0
form. 0

“This 0

is 0
a 0
loser 0
for 0
the 0
school 0
district,” 0
Haynes 0
said. 0

“It’s 0
difficult 0
to 0
satisfy 0
the 0
First 0
Amendment 0
in 0
elementary 0
school 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
Bible. 0

Students 0
at 0
that 0
age 0
really 0
aren’t 0
prepared 0
to 0
tell 0
the 0
difference 0
between 0
what 0
is 0
history 0
and 0
what 0
is 0
religious 0
conviction.” 0

Haynes 0

argues 0
that 0
people 0
of 0
faith 0
are 0
doing 0
their 0
religion 0
a 0
disservice 0
when 0
they 0
try 0
to 0
have 0
it 0
taught 0
by 0
a 0
government 0
entity. 0

They 0
would 0
rightly 0
object, 0
he 0
said, 0
if 0
they 0
lived 0
somewhere 0
where 0
they 0
were 0
the 0
religious 0
minority 0
and 0
supporters 0
of 0
another 0
religion 0
wanted 0
a 0
course 0
on 0
their 0
faith 0
taught 0
in 0
public 0
schools. 0

“Even 0

if 0
99.9 0
percent 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
the 0
community 0
want 0
it, 0
they 0
need 0
to 0
remember 0
that 0
liberty 1
of 1
conscience 1
is 1
not 1
up 1
for 1
a 1
vote,” 1
he 0
said. 0

Trenton 0

Tolliver 0
is 0
oblivious 0
to 0
the 0
Bible 0
battle 0
that 0
swirls 0
around 0
him. 0

His 0
first-grade 0
school 0
year 0
ends 0
next 0
month. 0

Hanging 0
in 0
the 0
balance 0
of 0
the 0
court 0
case 0
is 0
what 0
he 0
will 0
learn 0
in 0
the 0
Bible 0
course 0
in 0
second 0
grade. 0

Or 0
if 0
there 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
Bible 0

Kavanaugh 0
Nomination 0
Is 0
Exploding 1
in 1
Trump’s 1
Face 1

The 0
president 0
is 0
doubling 0
down 0
on 0
an 0
increasingly 0
risky 0
candidate. 0

Justice 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy 0
gave 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
the 1
biggest 1
political 1
gift 1
possible 1
when 0
he 0
announced 0
his 0
resignation 0
in 0
the 0
spring. 0

Even 0
though 0
not 0
everything 0
that’s 0
gone 0
wrong 0
is 0
Trump’s 0
fault, 0
he 0
has 0
managed 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
complete 1
hash 1
of 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
to 0
fill 0
the 0
empty 0
seat 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

It’s 0
a 0
good 0
example 0
of 0
how 1
badly 1
Trump 1
does 1
his 1
job 1
more 0
than 0
a 0
year 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
into 0
his 0
administration. 0

To 0

begin 0
with, 0
Trump 0
has 0
outsourced 0
his 0
judicial 0
nominations 0
to 0
outside, 0
party-aligned 0
groups, 0
the 0
Heritage 0
Foundation 0
and 0
the 0
Federalist 0
Society. 0

That 0
included 0
an 0
unusually 0
central 0
role 0
for 0
the 0
Federalist 0
Society’s 0
Leonard 0
Leo. 0

That 0

wasn’t 0
entirely 0
a 0
Trump 0
mistake. 0

His 0
decision 0
during 0
the 0
campaign 0
to 0
release 0
a 0
list 0
of 0
potential 0
justices 0
drafted 0
by 0
Leo 0
reflected 1
the 1
reality-TV 1
star’s 1
weakness 1
as 1
a 1
presidential 1
candidate. 1

The 0
party 0
was 0
worried 0
that 0
Trump 0
might 0
turn 0
out 0
not 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
conservative; 0
to 0
reassure 0
them, 0
he 0
publicly 0
committed 0
to 0
their 0
top 0
goal. 0

In 0
some 0
ways, 0
that’s 0
successful 0
coalition-building, 0
and 0
what 0
he’s 0
done 0
in 0
office 0
is 0
just 0
keeping 0
his 0
promises 0
on 0
judges. 0

Still, 0

it’s 0
one 0
thing 0
to 0
form 0
an 0
alliance 0
with 0
conservatives; 0
it’s 0
another 0
to 0
turn 0
the 0
whole 0
process 0
over 0
to 0
them. 0

We 0
don’t 0
know 0
to 0
what 0
extent 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
Trump’s 0
choice 0
and 0
to 0
what 0
extent 0
he 0
was 0
manipulated 0
into 0
choosing 0
him. 0

We 0
have 0
plenty 0
of 0
evidence 0
that 0
Trump 1
is 1
easily 1
manipulated 1
by 1
those 1
around 1
him, 1
and 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
fit 0
for 0
Trump’s 0
biases: 0
The 0
judge 0
has 0
Ivy 0
League 0
credentials 0
and 0
he 0
passes 0
Trump’s 0
cut-of-his-jib 1
test 1
by 0
looking 0
the 0
part. 0

1 0

Either 0

way, 0
Kavanaugh 0
was 0
a 0
poor 0
choice 0
from 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
view 0
of 0
good 0
presidenting. 0

The 0
judge 0
was 0
certain 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
highly 0
controversial 0
selection 0
from 0
the 0
start. 0

After 0
all, 0
he 0
had 0
been 0
a 0
highly 0
controversial 0
selection 0
for 0
his 0
current 0
circuit 0
court 0
seat, 0
eventually 0
getting 0
confirmed 0
with 0
only 0
four 0
Democratic 0
votes 0
after 0
a 0
long 0
delay. 0

Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
longtime 0
Republican 0
operative, 0
a 0
hard-liner 0
during 0
both 0
the 0
Vince 0
Foster 0
and 0
Monica 0
Lewinsky 0
investigations. 0

Nominating 0
him, 0
rather 0
than 0
a 0
conservative 0
with 0
similar 0
views 0
but 0
a 0
different 0
background, 0
was 0
bound 0
to 0
stir 0
up 0
trouble. 0

It 0
was 0
also 0
true, 0
as 0
Senate 0
Majority 0
Leader 0
Mitch 0
McConnell 0
reportedly 0
warned, 0
that 0
normal 0
disclosure 0
of 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
record, 0
especially 0
his 0
service 0
during 0
the 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
administration, 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
delay 0
confirmation 0
even 0
more. 0

Senate 0
Republicans 0
dealt 0
with 0
that 0
problem 0
by 0
deciding 0
to 0
not 0
bother 0
with 0
any 0
Kavanaugh 0
documents 0
that 0
couldn’t 0
be 0
produced 0
rapidly, 0
which 0
further 0
riled 0
up 0
the 0
Democrats 0
and 0
gave 0
that 0
party 0
some 0
good 0
talking 0
points. 0

2 0

Sometimes 0

it’s 0

worth 0
taking 0
risks. 0

Presidents 0
who 0
shy 0
away 0
from 0
anything 0
that’s 0
not 0
a 0
sure 0
thing 0
can 0
fail 0
to 0
exploit 0
opportunities. 0

It’s 0
just 0
very 0
hard 0
to 0
see 0
any 0
upside 0
for 0
Trump 0
in 0
choosing 0
Kavanaugh 0
instead 0
of 0
a 0
safer, 0
but 0
still 0
very 0
conservative, 0
other 0
option. 0

3 0

When 0

serious 0
charges 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
were 0
raised 0
against 0
Kavanaugh, 0
Trump 0
decided 0
to 0
stick 0
with 0
him 0
instead 0
of 0
moving 0
on 0
to 0
another 0
candidate. 0

It’s 0
still 0
not 0
clear 0
that 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
is 0
doomed, 0
but 0
it’s 0
certainly 0
in 0
severe 1
trouble. 1

Losing 0
a 0
high-profile 0
fight 0
is 0
always 0
going 0
to 0
hurt 0
a 0
president, 0
which 0
is 0
why 0
they 0
should 0
take 0
care 0
to 0
avoid 0
high-risk, 0
low-reward 0
conflicts. 0

But 0
there’s 0
an 0
art 0
to 0
minimizing 0
damage. 0

And 0
Trump 1
hasn’t 1
learned 1
it 1
yet. 1

For 0

one 0
thing, 0
the 0
president 0
has 0
made 0
this 0
an 0
extremely 1
high-profile 1
episode 1
by 0
stringing 0
out 0
the 0
process 0
as 0
the 0
accusations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
gained 0
credibility 0
and 0
even 0
multiplied. 0

Whether 0
that 0
matters 0
in 0
terms 0
of 0
public 0
opinion 0
for 0
Trump 0
is 0
unclear, 0
but 0
it 0
certainly 0
isn’t 0
good 0
for 0
any 0
Republican 0
senators 0
caught 0
up 0
in 0
the 0
middle, 0
along 0
with 0
any 0
other 0
candidates 0
who 0
have 0
had 0
to 0
weigh 0
in 0
only 0
to 0
find 0
the 0
facts 0
as 0
they 0
knew 0
them 0
constantly 0
changing. 0

It’s 0

also 0
the 0
case 0
that 0
the 0
more 0
negative 0
information 0
comes 0
out, 0
the 0
more 0
it 0
appears 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 1
and 1
his 1
White 1
House 1
staff 1
failed 1
to 1
do 1
their 1
jobs 1
in 0
vetting 0
and 0
managing 0
Kavanaugh. 0

If 0
the 0
nomination 0
had 0
been 0
pulled 0
right 0
after 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
made 0
her 0
initial 0
assertions 0
about 0
Kavanaugh, 0
the 0
public 0
might 0
have 0
concluded 0
that 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
Trump’s 0
fault 0
that 0
a 0
previously 0
unaired 0
accusation 0
came 0
to 0
light. 0

Meanwhile, 0

Trump’s 0
behavior 0
has 0
been 0
as 0
erratic 0
as 0
ever. 0

First 0
he 0
said 0
that 0
Brasey 0
had 0
to 0
be 0
heard; 0
then 0
he 0
attacked 0
her 0
in 0
terms 0
that 0
were 0
a 1
slur 1
on 1
all 1
women 1
who 0
have 0
been 0
assaulted 0
without 0
immediately 0
reporting 0
it 0
to 0
the 0
police, 0
and 0
he 0
also 0
blamed 0
the 0
Senate 0
for 0
not 0
voting 0
before 0
she 0
came 0
forward. 0

He 0
sometimes 0
praises 0
Kavanaugh, 0
but 0
also 0
let 0
it 0
be 0
known 0
that 0
he 0
thought 0
the 0
nominee 0
had 0
performed 0
badly 0
in 0
his 0
Fox 0
News 0
interview. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
demanded 0
a 0
final 0
up 0
and 0
down 0
vote 0
on 0
Tuesday; 0
by 0
Wednesday, 0
he 0
was 0
saying 0
that 0
the 0
nomination 0
would 0
die 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
didn’t 0
do 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

The 0
sum 0
of 0
all 0
this 0
has 0
been, 0
as 0
in 0
many 0
other 0
episodes, 0
that 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
White 0
House 0
are 0
a 1
gang 1
that 1
can’t 1
shoot 1
straight 1
and 0
that 0
he’s 0
eager 0
to 0
blame 0
his 0
allies 0
and 0
lash 0
out 0
at 0
his 0
enemies 0
in 0
ugly 1
ways 1
when 0
things 0
go 0
wrong. 0

A 0

botched 0
nomination 0
matters 0
because 0
allies 0
will 0
be 0
less 0
likely 0
to 0
trust 0
Trump, 0
not 0
just 0
on 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
choices, 0
but 0
on 0
any 0
initiative. 0

And, 0
for 0
that 0
matter, 0
they’ll 0
be 0
less 0
likely 0
to 0
trust 0
him 0
when 0
he 0
asserts 0
that 0
there’s 0
nothing 0
remaining 0
for 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
to 0
reveal. 0

Trump’s 0
professional 0
reputation 0
is 0
already 0
terrible, 0
but 0
everything 0
counts. 0

As 1
the 1
political 1
scientist 1
Richard 1
Neustadt 1
said, 1
political 1
elites 1
are 1
constantly 1
evaluating 1
and 1
re-evaluating 1
the 1
president. 1

Trump 0
is 0
hurting 0
himself 0
right 0
now, 0
and 0
will 0
have 0
hurt 0
himself 0
more 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
not 0
confirmed. 0

And 0

yes, 0
I 0
call 0
it 0
the 0
cut-of-his-jib 1
test 1
quite 0
deliberately. 0

It's 0
no 0
surprise 0
that 0
someone 1
who 1
hires 1
based 1
on 1
what 1
he 1
thinks 1
someone 1
doing 1
that 1
job 1
should 1
look 1
like, 1
which 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
based 0
on 0
hazy 1
old-time 1
Hollywood 1
casting, 1
would 0
wind 0
up 0
with 0
fewer 0
women 0
in 0
his 0
administration 0
than 0
any 0
of 0
his 0
recent 0
predecessors. 0

I've 0

argued 0
that 0
too 0
much 0
disclosure 0
is 0
required, 0
and 0
that 0
Democrats 0
(and 0
any 0
wavering 0
Republicans) 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
enough 0
information 0
to 0
make 0
up 0
their 0
mind. 0

I 0
still 0
think 0
that's 0
true. 0

But 0
it 0
did 0
leave 0
Republicans 0
vulnerable 0
to 0
claims 0
about 0
transparency 0
which 0
were 0
likely 0
to 0
be 0
popular 0
-- 0
most 0
people, 0
and 0
the 0

vulnerable 0
to 0
bombshells 1
in 0
the 0
documentary 0
record 0
which 0
hadn't 0
been 0
initially 0
disclosed. 0

In 0
the 0
event, 0
that's 0
not 0
what's 0
causing 0
the 0
trouble, 0
but 0
still 0
it's 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
Trump 0
taking 0
needless 0
risks. 0

Some 0

have 0
speculated 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
would 0
be 0
especially 0
likely 0
to 0
rule 0
in 0
Trump's 0
favor 0
if 0
any 0
cases 0
stemming 0
from 0
the 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
wind 0
up 0
at 0
the 0
high 0
court. 0

Perhaps. 0

There 0
are 0
plenty 0
of 0
other 0
partisan, 1
conservative 1
judges, 1
and 0
plenty 0
of 0
conservative 0
judges 0
who 0
lean 0
towards 0
an 0
expansive 0
view 0
of 0
presidential 0
powers. 0

And 0
if 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
really 0
an 0
outlier 0
on 0
that 0
issue, 0
then 0
he 0
won't 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
majority 0
on 0
any 0
future 0
decision 0
anyway. 0

So, 0
no, 0
I 0
don't 0
think 0
there's 0
any 0
good 0
reason 0
to 0
think 0
Kavanaugh 0
would 0
be 0
especially 0
helpful 0
to 0
Trump 0
compared 0
to 0
others 0
he 0
could 0
have 0
selected. 0

Ex-Navy 0

A 0
former 0

who 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
five 0
people 0
to 0
receive 0
a 0
pardon 0
from 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
is 0
planning 0
to 0
file 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
against 0
Obama 0
administration 0
officials, 0
alleging 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
subject 0
to 0
unequal 0
protection 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

Specifically, 0
Kristian 0
Saucier, 0
who 0
served 0
a 0
year 0
in 0
federal 0
prison 0
for 0
taking 0
photos 0
of 0
classified 0
sections 0
of 0
the 0
submarine 0
on 0
which 0
he 0
worked, 0
argues 0
that 0
the 0
same 0
officials 0
who 0
meted 0
out 0
punishment 0
to 0
him 0
for 0
his 0
actions 0
chose 0
to 0
be 0
lenient 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
in 0
her 0
use 0
of 0
a 0
private 0
email 0
server 0
and 0
handling 0
of 0
classified 0
information. 0

His 0
lawyer, 0
Ronald 0
Daigle, 0
told 0
Fox 0
News 0
on 0
Monday 0
that 0
the 0
lawsuit, 0
which 0
he 0
expects 0
to 0
file 0
soon 0
in 0
Manhattan, 0
will 0
name 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice, 0
former 0
FBI 0
Director 0
James 0
Comey 0
and 0
former 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama 0
as 0
defendants, 0
among 0
others. 0

“They 0
interpreted 0
the 0
law 0
in 0
my 0
case 0
to 0
say 0
it 0
was 0
criminal,” 0
Saucier 0
told 0
Fox 0
News, 0
referring 0
to 0
prosecuting 0
authorities 0
in 0
his 0
case, 0
“but 0
they 0
didn’t 0
prosecute 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

Hillary 0
is 0
still 0
walking 0
free. 0

Two 0
guys 0
on 0
my 0
ship 0
did 0
the 0
same 0
thing 0
and 0
weren’t 0
treated 0
as 0
criminals. 0

We 0
want 0
them 0
to 0
correct 0
the 0
wrong.” 0

Daigle 0
said 0
that 0
a 0
notice 0
about 0
the 0
pending 0
lawsuit 0
was 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
and 0
others 0
included 0
in 0
it 0
in 0
December. 0

There 0
is 0
usually 0
a 0
six-month 0
period 0
that 0
must 0
lapse 0
before 0
the 0
lawsuit 0
actually 0
is 0
filed. 0

“We’ll 0
highlight 0
the 0
differences 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
was 0
prosecuted 0
and 0
how 0
my 0
client 0
was 0
prosecuted,” 0
Daigle 0
said. 0

“We’re 0
seeking 0
to 0
cast 0
a 0
light 0
on 0
this 0
to 0
show 0
that 0
there’s 0
a 0
two-tier 0
justice 0
system 0
and 0
we 0
want 0
it 0
to 0
be 0
corrected.” 0

While 0
campaigning, 0
and 0
after 0
taking 0
office, 0
Trump 0
frequently 0
voiced 0
support 0
for 0
Saucier, 0
who 0
in 0
March 0
became 0
the 0
second 0
person 0
he 0
pardoned. 0

Trump 0
often 0
compared 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
handling 0
of 0
Saucier’s 0
case 0
with 0
that 0
of 0
Clinton. 0

Saucier, 0
who 0
lives 0
in 0
Vermont, 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
in 0
2016 0
to 0
taking 0
photos 0
inside 0
the 0
USS 0
Alexandria 0
while 0
it 0
was 0
stationed 0
in 0
Groton, 0
Connecticut, 0
in 0
2009. 0

He 0
said 0
he 0
only 0
wanted 0
service 0
mementos, 0
but 0
federal 0
prosecutors 0
argued 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
disgruntled 0
sailor 0
who 0
had 0
put 0
national 0
security 0
at 0
risk 0
by 0
taking 0
photos 0
showing 0
the 0
submarine's 0
propulsion 0
system 0
and 0
reactor 0
compartment 0
and 0
then 0
obstructed 0
justice 0
by 0
destroying 0
a 0
laptop 0
and 0
camera. 0

Saucier 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
recognized 0
he 0
had 0
erred 0
in 0
taking 0
the 0
photos, 0
which 0
he 0
said 0
he 0
wanted 0
to 0
show 0
only 0
to 0
his 0
family 0
to 0
show 0
them 0
where 0
he 0
worked. 0

But 0
he 0
lashed 0
out 0
at 0
Obama 0
officials, 0
saying 0
that 0
his 0
prosecution 0
was 0
politically 0
motivated, 0
prompted 0
by 0
sensitivity 0
about 0
classified 0
information 0
amid 0
the 0
scandal 0
involving 0
Clinton's 0
emails. 0

“My 0
case 0
was 0
usually 0
something 0
handled 0
by 0
military 0
courts,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“They 1
used 1
me 1
as 1
an 1
example 1
because 1
of 1
[the 1
backlash 1
over] 1
Hillary 1
Clinton.” 1

Saucier, 0
31, 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
pardon 0
has 0
enabled 0
him 0
to 0
pick 0
up 0
the 0
pieces 0
and 0
rebuild 0
his 0
life 0
with 0
his 0
wife 0
and 0
young 0
daughter. 0

A 0
felony 0
conviction 0
left 0
him 0
scrambling 0
to 0
find 0
work; 0
he 0
finally 0
landed 0
a 0
job 0
collecting 0
garbage. 0

Now, 0
he 0
works 0
on 0
design 0
and 0
engineering 0
projects 0
for 0
an 0
industrial 0
boiler 0
company. 0

“Things 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
go 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction,” 0
Saucier 0
said. 0

“I 0
work 0
with 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
really 0
great 0
people, 0
I 0
get 0
to 0
use 0
my 0
skills 0
set.” 0

Because 0
of 0
the 0
loss 0
of 0
income 0
during 0
his 0
imprisonment, 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
earning 0
below 0
his 0
potential 0
when 0
he 0
collected 0
garbage, 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
Sadie 0
lost 0
their 0
home 0
to 0
foreclosure. 0

Debt 0
collectors 0
called 0
and 0
his 0
cars 0
were 0
repossessed. 0

“With 0
a 0
pardon 0
there’s 0
no 0
magic 0
wand 0
that 0
that 0
gets 0
waved 0
and 0
makes 0
everything 0
right,” 0
he 0
said, 0
“But 0
I 0
try 0
to 0
stay 0
positive 0
and 0
look 0
forward.” 0

He 0
praises 0
the 0
pardons 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
granted, 0
and 0
takes 0
exception 0
at 0
the 0
criticism. 0

“The 0
Obama 0
administration 0
singled 0
out 0
Dinesh 0
for 0
things 0
most 0
people 0
don’t 0
even 0
get 0
charged 0
for,” 0
Saucier 0
said. 0

“President 0
Trump 0
noticed 0
that 0
my 0
career 0
was 0
exemplary 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
didn’t 0
deserve 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
me. 0

D'Souza, 0

It’s 0
no 0

that 0
the 0

has 0
a 0
strong 0

for 0

the 0

issues 0
on 0
which 0
the 0

the 0
country 0
both 0
before 0
and 0
after 0

However, 0

of 0
even 0
the 0

alone 0
in 0
his 0

On 0
December 0
12, 0
Trump’s 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
U.N., 0
Nikki 0
Haley, 0
gave 0
a 0
grandiose 0
speech 0
demonizing 0
Iran 0
that 0
echoed 0
Colin 0
Powell’s 0
infamous 0
performance 0
before 0
the 0
U.N. 0
in 0
2003. 0

Haley’s 0
essential 0
claim 0
was 0
that 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
is 0
under 0
attack 0
by 0
missiles 0
supplied 0
to 0
Yemen 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0

and 0
that 0
the 0
world 0
should 0
not 0
sit 0
idly 0
by 0
as 0
this 0
goes 0
on. 0

“If 1
we 1
do 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
missiles 1
fired 1
at 1
Saudi 1
Arabia, 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
violence,” 1
Haley 0
warned. 0

“There 0
is 0
clear 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
that 0
landed 0
on 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
come 0
from 0
Iran,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“The 0
evidence 0
is 0
undeniable. 0

The 0
weapons 0

well 0
have 0
had 0

However, 0
even 0
as 0
Haley 0
opened 0
her 0
mouth, 0
many 0
commentators 0
could 0
already 0
identify 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
issues 0
with 0
her 0
speech. 0

As 0
Common 0
Dream’s 0
Reza 0
Marashi 0
explained: 0

“Haley 0
cited 0
a 0
UN 0
report 0
in 0
her 0
claim 0
regarding 0
Iranian 0
missile 0
transfers 0
to 0
the 0
Houthis. 0

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
UN 0
has 0
reached 0
no 0
such 0
conclusion. 0

Instead, 0
a 0
panel 0
of 0
experts 0
concluded 0
that 0
fired 0
missile 0
fragments 0
show 0
components 0
from 0
an 0
Iranian 0
company, 0
but 0
they 0
have 0
‘no 0
evidence 0
as 0
to 0
the 0
identity 0
of 0
the 0
broker 0
or 0
supplier.’ 0
Asked 0
about 0
Haley’s 0
claim 0
that 0
Iran 0
is 0
the 0
culprit, 0
Sweden’s 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
said, 0
‘The 0
info 0
I 0
have 0
is 0
less 0
clear.’ 0
Analysts 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Defense 0
speaking 0
to 0
reporters 0
at 0
Haley’s 0
speech 0
openly 0
acknowledged 0
that 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
the 0
missiles’ 0
origin. 0

Perhaps 0
most 0
surreal 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
same 0
UN 0
report 0
cited 0
by 0
Haley 0
also 0
says 0
the 0
missile 0
included 0
a 0
component 0
that 0
was 0
manufactured 0
by 0
an 0
American 0
company. 0

Did 1
she 1
disingenuously 1
omit 1
that 1
inconvenient 1
bit 1
from 1
her 1
remarks, 1
or 1
fail 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
entire 1
UN 1
report? 1

The 0
world 0
may 0
never 0
know.” 0

Regardless 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Haley 0
misrepresented 0
the 0
U.N. 0
report 0
in 0
question, 0
it 0
appears 0
the 0
entire 1
premise 1
of 1
the 1
U.N. 1
report 1
is 1
almost 1
completely 1
incorrect, 1
anyway, 0
according 0
to 0
former 0
inspector 0
Scott 0
Ritter. 0

Ritter 0
writes: 0

“The 0
missile 0
debris 0
in 0
question 0
actually 0
contradicts 0
the 0
finding 0
of 0
the 0
UN 0
panel, 0
which 0
held 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
launched 0
against 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
had 0
been 0
transferred 0
to 0
Yemen 0
in 0
pieces 0
and 0
assembled 0
there 0
by 0
Houthi 0
missile 0
engineers; 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
in 0
question 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
possession 0
of 0
Yemen 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Arabian-led 0
intervention 0
of 0
2015, 0
and 0
that 0
their 0
source 0
was 0
either 0
Soviet 0
or 0
North 0
Korean. 0

The 0
modification 0
kits, 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
of 0
Iranian 0
origin, 0
and 0
were 0
transported 0
to 0
Yemen 0
via 0
Oman. 0

The 0
UN 0
panel 0
claims 0
not 0
to 0
have 0
any 0
evidence 0
of 0
‘external 0
missile 0
specialists’ 0
working 0
alongside 0
the 0
Houthi; 0
indeed, 0
the 0
simplicity 0
of 0
the 0
Burkhan 0
2-H 0
modification 0
concept 0
is 0
such 0
that 0
anyone 0
already 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
SCUD-B 0
missile 0
system 0
would 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
implement 0
the 0
required 0
processes 0
without 0
outside 0
assistance.” 0
[emphasis 0
added] 0

So 0
where 0
did 0
the 0
missiles 0
come 0
from, 0
and 0
who 0
made 0
them? 0

According 0
to 0
Ritter: 0

“Rather 0
than 0
the 0
Iranian-manufactured 0
Qiam-1 0
missiles 0
Haley 0
and 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Arabian 0
government 0
claimed, 0
the 0
debris 0
presented 0
by 0
Haley 0
were 0
of 0
a 0
modified 0
Soviet-manufactured 0
SCUD-B 0
missile; 0
the 0
airframe 0
and 0
engine 0
are 0
original 0
Soviet-made 0
components, 0
and 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
smaller 0
parts 0
on 0
display 0
bear 0
Cyrillic 0
(i.e., 0
Russian) 0
markings. 0

The 0
transformation 0
to 0
the 0
Burkhan 0
2-H 0
design 0
required 0
the 0
Houthi 0
engineers 0
to 0
increase 0
the 0
size 0
of 0
the 0
fuel 0
and 0
oxidizer 0
tanks, 0
and 0
lengthen 0
the 0
airframe 0
accordingly. 0

This 0
is 0
done 0
by 0
cutting 0
the 0
airframe, 0
and 0
welding 0
in 0
place 0
the 0
appropriate 0
segments 0
(this 0
also 0
required 0
that 0
the 0
fuel 0
supply 0
pipe, 0
which 0
passes 0
through 0
the 0
oxidizer 0
tank, 0
be 0
similarly 0
lengthened.) 0

The 0
difference 0
in 0
quality 0

Those 0

have 0

to 0
this 0

suppliers. 0

In 0
January 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
a 0
panel 0
of 0
U.N. 0
experts 0
stated: 0

“The 0
panel 0
has 0
not 0
seen 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
confirm 0
any 0
direct 0
large-scale 0
supply 0
of 0
arms 0
from 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran, 0
although 0
there 0
are 0
indicators 0
that 0
anti-tank 0
guided 0

being 0
supplied 0
to 0
the 0
Houthi 0
or 0
Saleh 0
forces 0
are 0
of 0
Iranian 0
manufacture.” 0
[emphasis 0
added] 0

Even 0
if 0
Iran 0
were 0
arming 0
the 0
Houthis, 0
Haley’s 0
hypocritical 1
anti-Iran 0
rhetoric 0
doesn’t 0
excuse 0
the 0
U.S. 0
for 0
continuing 0
a 0
foreign 0
policy 0
that 0
essentially 0
armed 0
ISIS 0
through 0
U.S. 0
weapons 0
transfers, 0
or 0
for 0
arming 0
al-Qaeda’s 0
affiliate 0

just 0
to 0
name 0
two 0
examples 0
of 0
Washington’s 0
schizophrenic 1
approach 1
to 0
the 0
region. 0

Why 1
is 1
the 1
U.S. 1
singling 1
out 1
Iran, 1
especially 1
when 1
the 1
Houthi 1
rebels 1
are 1
sworn 1
enemies 1
of 1
al-Qaeda? 1

The 0
issues 0
here 0
go 0
much 0
deeper 0
than 0
nonsensical 0
hypocrisy. 0

According 0
to 0
Ritter, 0
the 0
entire 0
debacle 0
has 0
shown 0
that 0
if 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
cannot 0
contain 0
the 0
Houthi’s 0
missile 0
capabilities, 0
it 0
cannot 0
possibly 0
hope 0
to 0
take 0
on 0
Iran, 0
which 0
possesses 0
a 0
significantly 0
more 0
advanced 0
military 0
than 0
the 0
Houthis 0
do 0
on 0
their 0
own. 0

Ritter 0
explains 0
further: 0

“If 0
a 0
relatively 0
unsophisticated 0
foe 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
Houthi, 0
using 0
Iranian-modified 0
Soviet 0
and 0
North 0
Korean 0
missiles 0
derived 0
from 0
40-year-old 0
technology, 0
can 0
evade 0
an 0
enemy 0
force 0
using 0
the 0
most 0
modern 0
combat 0
aircraft 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
the 0
most 0
sophisticated 0
intelligence 0
gathering 0
systems 0
available, 0
and 0
successfully 0
launch 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
that 0
threaten 0
the 0
political 0
and 0
economic 0
infrastructure 0
of 0
the 0
targeted 0
state, 0
what 0
does 0
that 0
say 0
about 0
the 0
prospects 0
of 0
any 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
taking 0
on 0
the 0
far 0
more 0
advanced 0
mobile 0
missile 0
threats 0
that 0
exist 0
in 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
Iran 0
today? 0

The 0
fact 0
of 0
the 0
matter 0
is 0
that 0
no 0
military 0
anywhere 0
has 0
shown 0
the 0
ability 0
to 0
successfully 0
interdict 0
in 0
any 0
meaningful 0
way 0
a 0
determined 0
opponent 0
armed 0
with 0
mobile 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
capability. 0

If 0
the 0
Saudi 0
experience 0
in 0
Yemen 0
is 0
to 0
teach 0
us 0
anything, 0
it 0
is 0
that 0
any 0
military 0
plan 0
designed 0
to 0
confront 0
nations 0
such 0
as 0
North 0
Korea, 0
Iran 0
and 0
Russia 0
that 0
are 0
armed 0
with 0
sophisticated 0
mobile 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
had 0
better 0
count 0
on 0
those 0
capabilities 0
remaining 0
intact 0
throughout 0
any 0
anticipated 0
period 0
of 0
hostility. 0

No 1
amount 1
of 1
chest-thumping 1
and 1
empty 1
rhetoric 1
by 1
American 1
political 1
and/or 1
military 1
leaders 1
can 1
offset 1
this 1
harsh 1
reality. 1

This 1
is 1
the 1
critical 1
lesson 1
of 1
Yemen, 1
and 1
the 1
United 1

would 1
do 1

So, 0
let’s 0

right? 0

Raise 0
the 0

from 0
7 0
to 0
11 0
percent. 0

That 0
will 0

Raise 0

that 0

Give 0

Siraj 0
Ibn 0

in 0

“No 1

Thomas 0

argued 0
in 0

“If 1
these 1
were 1
white 1

of 1
a 1
Christian 1
faith 1
who 1
owned 1
guns, 1
that’s 1
not 1
a 1

because 1
there’s 1
a 1

If 1

is 1
of 1
no 1
consequence 1
because 1
we 1
have 1

But 1
they 1

a 0

on 0

his 0

seventh 0
grade 0
social 0
studies 0

issued 0
to 0

according 0
to 0
Christian 0

The 0
packet, 0
edited 0
from 0
the 0
full 0
version 0
of 0
a 0
world 0
religions 0
workbook, 0
instructed 0
students 0
to 0
practice 0
writing 0
the 0
Shahada, 0
or 0
Islamic 0
profession 0
of 0
faith, 0
in 0
Arabic 0
calligraphy 0
— 0
an 0
assignment 0
that, 0
if 0
left 0
undone, 0
would 0
result 0
in 0
detention, 0
according 0
to 0
Penkoski’s 0
daughter. 0

The 0
Shahada 0
states: 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
god 0
but 0
Allah, 0
and 0
Muhammad 0
is 0
the 0
messenger 0
of 0
Allah.” 0
Penkoski 0
called 0
Mountain 0
Ridge 0
Middle 0
School 0
Principal 0
Ron 0
Branch 0
and 0
objected 0
to 0
the 0
packet, 0
saying 0
it 0
disturbed 1
him 0
and 0
had 0
misinformation 0
about 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
calligraphy. 0

“I 0
saw 0
the 0
assignment 0
of 0
writing 0
the 0
Shahada 0
in 0
Arabic. 0

Their 0
excuse 0
was 0
calligraphy,” 0
Penkoski 0
told 0
The 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

“I 0
was 0
like, 0
‘Whoa! 0

Whoa! 0

Whoa!’ 0
First 0
of 0
all, 0
calligraphy 0
was 0
invented 0
in 0
China 0
3,000 0
years 0
prior 0
to 0
Muhammad. 0

The 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
get 0
my 0
daughter 0
to 0
write 0
that 0
disturbed 1
me.” 0
“I 0
said, 0
‘That 0
is 0
not 0
happening. 0

My 0
daughter 0
is 0
not 0
doing 0
that.’ 0
My 0
daughter 0
told 0
me 0
that 0
if 0
she 0
didn’t 0
do 0
the 0
assignment, 0
then 0
she 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
get 0
a 0
[detention] 0
slip,” 0
Penkoski 0
added…. 0

There 0
were 0
two 0
different 0
calligraphy 0
assignments 0
— 0
one 0
involving 0
the 0
Shahada 0
and 0
another 0
instructing 0
students 0
to 0
practice 0
writing 0
English 0
letters 0
in 0
calligraphy, 0
Branch 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

Hinson 0
“told 0
the 0
students 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
do 0
these 0
activities 0
if 0
they 0
wanted,” 0
Branch 0
claimed. 0

“The 0
teacher 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
several 0
times 0
that 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
study 0
of 0
world 0
religions 0
and 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
not 0
trying 0
to 0
advocate 0
for 0
any 0
religion 0
over 0
another. 0

She 0
has 0
told 0
her 0
class 0
that 0
if 0
they 0
had 0
questions 0
about 0
religious 0
beliefs, 0
that 0
those 0
conversations 0
should 0
take 0
place 0
with 0
their 0
parents,” 0
Branch 0
added. 0

Penkoski 0
claimed 0
the 0
teacher 0
sent 0
students 0
home 0
with 0
the 0
same 0
packet 0
the 0
day 0
after 0
he 0
lodged 0
a 0
complaint 0
— 0
this 0
time, 0
with 0
certain 0
sections 0
crossed 0
out 0
but 0
still 0
including 0
the 0
Shahada 0
assignment. 0

Penkoksi 0
called 0
the 0
principal 0
again 0
and 0
confronted 0
Hinson 0
over 0
the 0
phone. 0

“I 0
said, 0
‘This 0
is 0
not 0
OK 0
in 0
asking 0
my 0
kid 0
to 0
write 0
down 0
the 0
Shahada.’ 0
The 0
teacher 0
happened 0
to 0
walk-in 0
and 0
said 0
she 0
made 0
it 0
an 0
option 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
kids 0
didn’t 0
have 0
to 0
do 0
it. 0

My 0
daughter 0
conflicted 0
that 0
story 0
and 0
said, 0
‘No, 0
that 0
is 0
not 0
what 0
was 0
said.’ 0
What 0
was 0
said 0
was, 0
‘Do 0
the 0
assignment; 0
and 0
if 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
learn 0
more 0
about 0
the 0
Quran, 0
ask 0
your 0
parents,’” 0
Penkoski 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

Each 0
religion 0
studied 0
in 0
the 0
class, 0
including 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism, 0
received 0
“equitable 0
treatment,” 0
Branch 0
also 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

He 0
said 0
the 0
class 0
spent 0
a 0
week 0
and 0
a 0
half 0
on 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
— 0
other 0
religions 0
took 0
one 0
week 0
— 0
and 0
discussed 0
each 0
religion’s 0
beliefs, 0
history 0
and 0
practices. 0

During 0
the 0
section 0
on 0
Christianity, 0
“Jesus 0
was 0
taught,” 0
Branch 0
claimed. 0

“The 0
students 0
read 0
the 0
chapter 0
in 0
our 0
textbook 0
that 0
discusses 0
Christianity’s 0
belief 0
that 0
Jesus 0
is 0
the 0
Son 0
of 0
God, 0
and 0
salvation. 0

They 0
also 0
discussed 0
the 0
Sermon 0
on 0
the 0
Mount, 0
the 0
Last 0
Supper 0
and 0
Jesus’ 0
Betrayal, 0
the 0
Trinity, 0
and 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer, 0
among 0
other 0
topics,” 0
Branch 0
said. 0

Penkoski 0
and 0
his 0
daughter, 0
Brielle, 0
contested 0
Branch’s 0
claims. 0

The 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer 0
was 0
not 0
taught, 0
and 0
very 0
little 0
time 0
was 0
spent 0
teaching 0
about 0
Jesus, 0
they 0
told 0
Christian 0
Post. 0

“We 0
did 0
[the 0
unit 0
on 0
Christianity] 0
over 0
a 0
week 0
and 0
two 0
days. 0

We 0
watched 0
two 0
different 0
videos. 0

We 0
didn’t 0
finish 0
them. 0

They 0
taught 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
about 0
Moses 0
and 0
the 0
Ten 0
Commandments, 0
Peter 0
and 0
Paul,” 0
Brielle 0
explained. 0

“We 0
learned 0
about 0
the 0
Israelites 0
and 0
how 0
they 0
are 0
being 0
persecuted 0
by 0
the 0
Romans. 0

We 0
were 0
told 0
about 0
the 0
Jews 0
and 0
told 0
a 0
little 0
bit 0
about 0
Jesus.” 0
Penkoski 0
also 0
shared 0
with 0
Christian 0
Post 0
the 0
packets 0
on 0
Christianity 0
and 0
Judaism 0
passed 0
out 0
in 0
class 0
and 0
allegedly 0
modified 0
from 0
the 0
original 0
full 0
version. 0

While 0
the 0
packet 0
on 0
Islam 0
contained 0
verses 0
from 0
the 0
Koran, 0
the 0
packets 0
for 0
those 0
religions 0
did 0
not 0
contain 0
scripture 0
and 0
did 0
not 0
encourage 0
students 0
to 0
write 0
prayers 0
or 0

statements, 0
he 0
said. 0

“Notice 0
no 0

In 0

his 0

Patterson, 0
too, 0
defended 0

– 0
by 0
comparing 0
his 0
sexual 0

'It's 0

he 0
blasted 0
Melvin. 0

'Let's 0

about 0

Let's 0
talk 0
about, 0

Stop 0
already!' 0

Clinton 0
piled 0
on. 0

'You 0

Do 0
you 0
believe 0
President 0

'I 0

Suddenly 0
philosophical 0
and 0
seeming 0
to 0
take 0

of 0

Clinton 0
said: 0

Dear 0
Cardinal 0
Marx 0
and 0
dear 0
Bishop 0
Bode, 0
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
Catholic 1
answer: 1
No! 1

And 0
your 1
addition 1
“in 1
individual 1
cases” 1
is 1
absolutely 1
worthless, 1
it 1
has 1
no 1
argumentative 1
force. 1

A 0
clear 0
statement 0
by 0
Bishop 0
Andreas 0
Laun 0
for 0
Kath.net. 0

Cardinal 0
Marx 0
and 0
also 0
Bishop 0
Bode 0
have 0
now 0
opened 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
idea 0
to 0
offer 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
a 0
blessing. 0

Why 1
not, 1
one 1
could 1
say, 1
since 1
the 1
Church 1
is 1
ready 1
to 1
bless 1
nearly 1
everything 1
on 1
the 1
earth? 1

Now, 0
the 0
Church 0
especially 0
blesses 0
people, 0
but 0
also 0
deeds 0
and 0
objects. 0

The 0
Jesuit 0
Father 0
Eckhard 0
Bieger 0
writes 0
in 0
the 0
Internet 0
about 0
Catholic 0
blessings: 0

For 0
Catholics, 0
really 0
everything 0
can 0
be 0
blessed, 0
not 0
only 0
places 0
of 0
worship, 0
chalices, 0
and 0
the 0
faithful 0
after 0
each 0
prayer 0
service 0
– 0
whether 0
after 0
a 0
Mass, 0
or 0
after 0
the 0
prayers 0
for 0
the 0
hours 0
of 0
the 0
day. 0

The 0
blessing 0
is 0
also 0
not 0
limited 0
to 0
rosaries 0
or 0
religious 0
medal, 0
but 0
one 0
may 0
also 0
bless 0
cars, 0
factory 0
halls, 0
animals, 0
herbs, 0
and 0
much 0
more. 0

only 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
by 0
priests 0
and 0
deacons, 0
especially 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
about 0
objects 0
of 0
worship 0
such 0
as 0
chalices 0
or 0
vestments. 0

But 0
parents 0
can 0
bless 0
their 0
children. 0

The 0
faithful 0
may 0
also 0
take 0
home 0
holy 0
water 0
and 0
sprinkle 0
it 0
on 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
family, 0
but 0
also 0
the 0
stable 0
and 0
the 0
animals, 0
thus 0
blessing 0
them. 0

[...] 0

What 0
kind 0
of 0
hope 0
is 0
connected 0
with 0
a 0
blessing? 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
car, 0
certainly 0
the 0
wish 0
for 0
heavenly 0
protection 0
– 0
sometimes 0
also 0
expressed 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
a 0
medal 0
of 0
St. 0
Christopher, 0
the 0
patron 0
saint 0
of 0
car 0
drivers. 0

With 0
the 0
weather 0
blessing, 0
one 0
prays 0
explicitly 0
for 0
protection 0
against 0
hail, 0
lightning 0
and 0
drought. 0

[…] 0

To 1
bless 1
always 1
means 1
that 1
something 1
shall 1
flourish, 1
because 1
only 1
then 1
when 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
blessing 1
upon 1
a 1
cause 1
or 1
a 1
project, 1
will 1
something 1
good 1
come 1
out 1
of 1
it. 1

The 0
blessing 0
comes 0
from 0
God, 0
He 0
is 0
being 0
addressed 0
in 0
the 0
form 0
of 0
a 0
request; 0
and 0
it 0
is 0
given 0
to 0
people, 0
objects, 0
and 0
buildings, 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
of 0
the 0
sign 0
of 0
the 0
cross, 0
holy 0
water, 0
and 0
incense. 0

[…] 0

But 0
now 0
concerning 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Marx, 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
few 0
of 0
the 0
priests, 0
the 0
answer 0
is 0
simple: 0
one 0
may 0
ask 0
for 0
God's 0
blessing 0
for 0
sinners, 0
but 0
not 0
for 0
the 0
sin. 0

That 1
is 1
to 1
say, 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
consecrate 1
a 1
brothel, 1
one 1
could 1
not 1
bless 1
a 1
concentration 1
camp 1
or 1
weapons 1
which 1
are 1
not 1
explicitly 1
ordained 1
for 1
hunting 1
or 1
for 1
legitimate 1
self-defense. 1

Therefore 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
one 1
may 1
not 1
bless 1
a 1
relationship 1
which 1
is 1
sinful; 1
[one 1
may 1
not 1
bless] 1
the 1
mafia; 1
no 1
blessing 1
for 1
organizations 1
or 1
institutions 1
which 1
promote 1
or 1
procure 1
abortions 1
or 1
which 1
propagate 1
ideologies 1
which 1
are 1
against 1
the 1
Faith, 1
antisemitic 1
contents, 1
or 1
other 1
forms 1
of 1
racist 1
thought. 1

If 1
one 1
considers 1
and 1
weighs 1
this 1
matter, 1
one 1
knows: 1
one 1
may 1
not 1
bless 1
a 1
union 1
of 1
two 1
homosexual 1
men 1
or 1
of 1
lesbian 1
women. 1

Of 0
course 0
[one 0
could 0
bless] 0
two 0
men 0
or 0
women 0
who 0
are 0
de 0
facto 0
homosexual, 0
and 0
that 0
it 0
what 0
happens 0
in 0
each 0
Holy 0
Mass 0
which 0
is 0
being 0
attended 0
by 0
them. 0

This 0
blessing 0
– 0
which 0
is 0
not 0
related 0
to 0
their 0
acts 0
– 0
is 0
being 0
received 0
also 0
by 0
all 0
the 0
other 0
sinners, 0
and 0
the 0
Church 0
thereby 0
hopes 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
convert 0
under 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
God's 0
Grace! 0

This 1
position 1
which 1
is 1
really 1
simple 1
and 1
easily 1
to 1
be 1
understood 1
has 0
been 0
clearly 0
and 0
convincingly 0
presented 0
– 0
since 0
the 0
statement 0
of 0
the 0
two 0
bishops 0
[Marx 0
and 0
Bode] 0
– 0
by 0
several 0
Christians: 0
by 0
Archbishops 0
Ludwig 0
Schick 0
(Germany) 0
and 0
Charles 0
Chaput 0
(USA); 0
by 0
the 0
German-speaking 0
theologians 0
Hubert 0
Windisch 0
and 0
Markus 0
Büning. 0

I 1
am 1
sure 1
there 1
are 1
many 1
many 1
others, 1
too, 1
who 1
think 1
alike, 1
but 1
whom 1
I 1
do 1
not 1
know. 1

Dear 1
Cardinal 1
Marx 1
and 1
dear 1
Bishop 1
Bode, 1
there 1
is 1
only 1
one 1
Catholic 1
answer: 1
No! 1

And 1
your 1
addition 1
“in 1
individual 1
cases” 1
is 1
absolutely 1
worthless, 1
it 1
has 1
no 1
argumentative 1
force. 1

What 0
would 0
St. 0
John 0
the 0
Baptist 0
have 0
said 0
if 0
Herod, 0
taking 0
for 0
himself 0
his 0
brother's 0
wife, 0
would 0
have 0
excusingly 0
called 0
himself 0
an 0
“individual 0
case”! 0

The 0
idea 0
to 0
bless 0
sinful 0
conduct 0
is 0
really 0
what 0
Isaiah 0
described 0
quite 0
vividly, 0
as 0
follows: 0
“Woe 0
to 0
you 0
that 0
call 0
evil 0
good, 0
and 0
good 0
evil: 0
that 0
put 0
darkness 0
for 0
light, 0
and 0
light 0
for 0
darkness: 0
that 0
put 0
bitter 0
for 0
sweet, 0
and 0
sweet 0
for 0
bitter.” 0
[Isaiah 0
5:20] 0

Is 0
this 0
not 0
exactly 0
what 0
Cardinal 0
Marx 0
– 0
and 0
others 0
who 0
are 0
thinking 0
like 0
him 0
– 0
are 0
doing? 0

If 0
one 0
were 0
to 0
place 0
on 0
a 0
bottle 0
of 0
sour 0
cucumbers 0
a 0
tag 0
“honey,” 0
the 0
cucumbers 0
still 0
remain 0
sour! 0

Even 0
blessing 0
bishops 0
cannot 0
change 0
that. 0

Nor 0
can 0
the 0
pope, 0
in 0
calling 0
for 0
a 0
cultural 0
revolution, 0
especially 0
since 0
he 0
does 0
not 0
explain 0
what 0
he 0
exactly 0
means 0
by 0
it. 0

He 0
says 0
that 0
he 0
“allows 0
himself” 0
to 0
talk 0
like 0
that 0
– 0
but 1
if 1
one 1
dares 1
something, 1
one 1
might 1
win, 1
but 1
one 1
also 1
can 1
perish. 1

That 0
seems 0
to 0
catch 0
on 0
these 0
days. 0

For 0
example, 0
the 0
Italian 0
moral 0
theologian, 0
Maurizio 0
Chiodi, 0
recently 0
claimed 0
in 0
his 0
talk 0
at 0
the 0
Gregorian 0
Pontifical 0
University 0
that 0
contraception 0
is 0
sometimes 0
not 0
only 0
not 0
forbidden, 0
but 0
even 0
demanded! 0

To 1
contradict 1
two 1
popes 1
– 1
whom 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
already 1
“beatified” 1
the 1
one 1
and 1
“canonized” 1
the 1
other 1
– 1
so 1
shortly 1
after 1
their 1
deaths, 1
and 1
in 1
such 1
a 1
radical 1
and 1
open 1
manner, 1
probably 1
has 1
never 1
happened 1
before 1
in 1
the 1
Church's 1
history. 1

Isaiah 1
says 1
that 1
such 1
people 1
draw 1
unto 1
them 1
God's 1
punishment, 1
with 1
thick 1
cords! 1

Nevertheless, 0
one 0
should 0
wish 0
for 0
Cardinal 0
Marx, 0
Bishop 0
Bode, 0
and 0
Professor 0
Chiodi 0
that 0
they 0
sleep 0
well. 0

Whether 0
their 0
conscience 0
will 0
allow 0
it, 0
is 0
not 0
so 0
certain; 0
but 0
if 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
[allow 0
it], 0
it 0
would 0
certainly 0
be 0
a 0
hope 0
for 0
their 0
conversion. 0

A 0
Dismal 0
Record: 0
Why 0
Are 0
They 0
Destroying 0
the 0
Nuns? 0

The 0
meeting 0
covered 0
Carmels 0
of 0
the 0
Teresian, 0
Discalced, 0
reform 0
from 0
Germany, 0
five 0
areas 0
of 0
Spain, 0
three 0
from 0
France, 0
Great 0
Britain, 0
Ireland, 0
Italy, 0
the 0
Netherlands, 0
Austria, 0
Croatia 0
and 0
the 0
Holy 0
Land 0
[1] 0
. 0

The 0
reports 0
from 0
each 0
region 0
showed 0
that 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
provisions 0
found 0
in 0
Cor 0
orans 0
were 0
already 0
in 0
place: 0
federations 0
with 0
broad 0
powers, 0
including 0
financial 0
control 0
and 0
combined 0
formation 0
courses, 0
“religious 0
assistant” 0
priests 0
appointed 0
by 0
the 0
federation 0
and 0
overseeing 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
and 0
superiors 0
giving 0
up 0
their 0
authority 0
to 0
the 0
federations. 0

Given 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
2009, 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
plans 0
to 0
force 0
all 0
contemplative 0
monasteries 0
in 0
the 0
world 0
into 0
this 0
disastrous 1
European 0
mould 0
were 0
well 0
under 0
way 0
long 0
before 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
was 0
even 0
considering 0
resigning. 0

Today 0
I’ve 0
received 0
an 0
interesting 0
document 0
issued 0
by 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
in 0
Europe 0
following 0
a 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
“Federations 0
of 0
Discalced 0
Carmelite 0
Nuns 0
of 0
Europe 0
& 0
the 0
Holy 0
Land” 0
in 0
Avila, 0
February 0
2009. 0

As 0
a 0
snapshot 0
of 0
the 0
current 0
condition 0
of 0
Carmelite 0
monastic 0
life 0
after 0
it 0
had 0
been 0
completely 0
“federated,” 0
it 0
paints 0
a 0
depressing 1
picture; 0
but 0
as 0
a 0
demonstration 0
of 0
what 0
“federations” 0
are 0
likely 0
to 0
achieve 0
once 0
Cor 0
orans 0
is 0
implemented 0
universally, 0
it 0
clangs 0
in 0
the 0
mind 0
like 1
a 1
funeral 1
bell. 1

Reconciled 0
to 0
managed 0
extinction 0

The 0
report 0
shows 0
average 0
ages 0
of 0
nuns 0
between 0
65 0
and 0
80, 0
“infirmary 0
Carmels,” 0
nuns 0
in 0
state 0
nursing 0
homes, 0
entire 0
communities 0
living 0
in 0
care 0
facilities 0
and 0
half 0
the 0
Carmels 0
with 0
no 0
one 0
in 0
formation. 0

Solutions 0
offered 0
are 0
equally 0
uniform: 0
heaped-up 0
bureaucracy, 0
common 0
formation 0
courses 0
between 0
monasteries 0
developed 0
by 0
“religious 0
psychologists,” 0
ever 0
more 0
powers 0
handed 0
to 0
federations. 0

This 0
is 0
federated 0
Carmelite 0
monastic 0
life 0
under 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
of 0
fully 0
implemented 0
VaticanTwoism. 0

Very 0
little 0
is 0
said 0
of 0
any 0
efforts 0
being 0
made 0
to 0
increase 0
vocational 0
outreach 0
using 0
the 0
internet 0
or 0
through 0
diocesan 0
contacts. 0

And 0
perhaps 0
most 0
telling 0
of 0
all, 0
not 0
one 0
word 0
is 0
offered 0
of 0
applying 0
any 0
systematic 0
religious 0
solutions; 0
no 0
one 0
is 0
suggesting 0
increased 0
prayer 0
or 0
fasting, 0
Rosary 0
campaigns 0
or 0
novenas 0
in 0
what 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order’s 0
most 1
desperate 1
hour. 0

Nothing 0
is 0
said 0
of 0
increased 0
intensity 0
of 0
devotion 0
to 0
the 0
charism, 0
study 0
of 0
the 0
foundress 0
or 0
returning 0
to 0
sources, 0
still 1
less 1
of 0
strengthening 0
the 0
Carmelites’ 0
traditional 0
independent 0
self-governance 0
or 0
reconsidering 0
the 0
wisdom 0
of 0
“the 0
path 0
taken”. 0

Indeed, 0
in 0
one 0
case 0
in 0
Spain, 0
the 0
sisters 0
themselves 0
advocate 0
abandoning 0
traditional 0
Teresian 0
autonomy 0
altogether. 0

The 0
report 0
from 0
Great 0
Britain 0
notes: 0
“18 0
Carmels 0
have 0
closed 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
40 0
years. 0

There 0
have 0
been 0
two 0
amalgamations 0
in 0
recent 0
years 0
and 0
another 0
one 0
involving 0
three 0
Carmels 0
is 0
in 0
process. 0

Two 0
communities 0
at 0
present 0
are 0
living 0
together 0
in 0
one 0
monastery 0
as 0
a 0
temporary 0
measure.” 0

The 0
case 0
of 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
is 0
downright 1
bizarre; 1
sisters 0
so 0
old 0
that 0
even 0
the 0
federation 0
structures 0
are 0
breaking 0
down. 0

Only 0
one 0
fully 0
autonomous 0
functioning 0
Carmel 0
still 0
exists 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands, 0
and 0
the 0
remains 0
of 0
four 0
entire 0
communities 0
are 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
single 0
care 0
home 0
run 0
by 0
religious 0
brothers. 0

But 0
in 0
this 0
situation, 0
the 0
“solution” 0
undertaken 0
has 0
been 0
an 0
elaborate 0
bureaucratic 0
reshuffle, 0
including 0
gaining 0
approval 0
from 0
Rome, 0
for 0
“a 0
completely 0
new 0
structure,” 0
whose 0
main 0
task, 0
no 0
doubt, 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
making 0
of 0
funeral 0
arrangements 0
and 0
disposing 0
of 0
library 0
books. 0

The 0
atmosphere 0
is 0
weirdly 0
resigned 0
– 0
one 0
federation 0
report 0
recommended 0
simply 0
“forgetting 0
the 0
numbers” 0
– 0
with 0
many 0
notes 0
of 0
mutual 0
congratulation 0
over 0
“unity,” 0
the 0
creating 0
of 0
“links” 0
and 0
the 0
“building 0
of 0
trust” 0
and 0
“dialogue” 0
between 0
communities. 0

The 0
report 0
from 0
Belgium 0
– 0
federated 0
in 0
1997, 0
average 0
age 0
73 0
with 0
one 0
sister 0
in 0
formation 0
for 0
11 0
monasteries 0
– 0
states 0
tersely 0
that 0
their 0
biggest 0
problem 0
is 0
“ageing” 0
but 0
under 0
“possible 0
solutions” 0
says 0
only, 0
“We 0
want 0
to 0
continue 0
along 0
the 0
path 0
we 0
have 0
begun.” 0

It 0
is 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
report 0
from 0
Croatia 0
where 0
the 0
problem 0
changes 0
abruptly 0
from 0
aging 0
nuns 0
and 0
no 0
vocations 0
to 0
too 0
many 0
vocations 0
with 0
not 0
enough 0
room[2]. 0

It 0
is 0
also 0
notable 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
only 0
in 0
the 0
Croatian 0
report 0
that 0
Christ 0
gets 0
a 0
direct 0
mention. 0

Federation 0
of 0
Croatia 0
& 0
Bosnia-Herzegovina: 0
82 0
nuns 0
in 0
5 0
convents, 0
with 0
an 0
average 0
age 0
of 0
47, 0
and 0
eleven 0
in 0
formation. 0

This 0
outlier 0
differs 0
from 0
the 0
Western 0
European 0
federations 0
in 0
several 0
respects, 0
notably 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
only 0
federated 0
in 0
2002. 0

But 0
the 0
effects 0
of 0
the 0
federating/formation 0
courses 0
are 0
already 0
being 0
felt: 0
“Nowadays, 0
two 0
monasteries 0
have 0
difficulty 0
because 0
of 0
a 0
lack 0
of 0
vocations.” 0

Path 0
taken: 0
Have 0
made 0
a 0
foundation 0
in 0
Albania; 0
however 0
this 0
community 0
is 0
not 0
federated. 0

From 0
the 0
beginning, 0
our 0
Association 0
has 0
organized 0
formation 0
courses 0
for 0
the 0
younger 0
sisters 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
courses 0
of 0
permanent 0
formation. 0

Each 0
year, 0
we 0
have 0
one 0
or 0
two 0
seminars, 0
which 0
are 0
also 0
the 0
occasion 0
to 0
the 0
meeting 0
of 0
the 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Association. 0

The 0
duration 0
is 0
3 0
to 0
4 0
days 0
and 0
they 0
take 0
place 0
every 0
time 0
in 0
a 0
different 0
Monastery 0
of 0
the 0
Association. 0

We 0
invite 0
the 0
sisters 0
of 0
other 0
Carmelite 0
convents 0
friends 0

It 0
is 0
not 0

to 0

A 0
lack 0
of 0

is 0
with 0
us 0
as 0
a 0
reality 0
in 0

life. 0

Moreover, 0
the 0
high 0
number 0

makes 0
difficult 0
to 0
maintain 0
all 0

Possible 0
Solutions: 0
It 0
is 0
completely 0
necessary 0
to 0

the 0
way 0

the 0
restructurings, 0
in 0
order 0

live 0
what 0
is 0
essential, 0
forgetting 0
the 0
numbers. 0

The 0
challenge 0
to 0
grow 0
in 0
confidence 0
and 0

should 0
lead 0
us 0
to 0
downgrade 0
the 0
famous 0

autonomy 0
because, 0

a 0

Dutch 0
Carmels 0

one 0
in 0

Only 0
one 0

in 0
the 0

are 0

the 0
Brothers 0

With 0
the 0

time 0
the 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0

has 0
transferred 0
tasks 0
to 0
the 0

of 0
the 0

according 0
to 0
the 0
faculties 0
described 0
in 0

in 0

Also, 0
with 0
the 0

have 0
asked 0

from 0

interests. 0

Due 0
to 0
our 0
very 0
advanced 0
age 0
in 0
the 0
Netherlands 0
we 0
have 0
reached 0
the 0
moment 0
when 0
a 0
General 0
Assembly 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
possible. 0

We 0
are 0
left 0
with 0
the 0
problem 0
that 0
in 0
the 0
communities 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
sisters 0
who 0
can 0
or 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
prioresses 0
or 0
council 0
sisters. 0

The 0
structure 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
that 0
we 0
have 0
had 0
till 0
now 0
is 0
thus 0
no 0
longer 0
possible. 0

Possible 0
solutions: 0
The 0
Federation 0
Council, 0
the 0
Religious 0
Assistant, 0
together 0
with 0
a 0
canon 0
lawyer 0
of 0
the 0
Dutch 0
Conference 0
of 0
Religious, 0
have 0
worked 0
hard 0
on 0
a 0
completely 0
new 0
structure, 0
in 0
which 0
in 0
its 0
first 0
draft 0
the 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
Carmel 0
has 0
been 0
constantly 0
kept 0
in 0
mind. 0

We 0
began 0
from 0
three 0
points: 0

1)Maintenance 0
of 0
the 0
formal 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
Carmels 0
that 0
still 0
exist, 0
but 0
with 0
the 0
chance 0
to 0
transfer 0
tasks 0
gradually 0
to 0
the 0
council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

2)Appointment 0

of 0
The 0
Federal 0
board 0
or 0
Federal 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation, 0
preferably 0
appointed 0
by 0
the 0
Superior 0
General. 0

The 0
team 0
will 0
consist 0
of 0
a 0
president 0
and 0
vice-president 0
who 0
are 0
members 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
convents, 0
appointed 0
to 0
functions, 0
and 0
of 0
three 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
members, 0
or 0
not, 0
of 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
convents. 0

3)A 0

Supervisory 0
council, 0
also 0
to 0
be 0
appointed 0
periodically 0
by 0
the 0
Superior 0
General, 0
which 0
will 0
be 0
made 0
up 0
of 0
three 0
members, 0
whose 0
president 0
will 0
be, 0
preferably, 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
religious 0
institute, 0
preferably 0
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
and 0
appointed 0
to 0
functions. 0

This 0
council 0
sees 0
itself 0
as 0
a 0
supervisory 0
body 0
and 0
to 0
give 0
advice 0
that 0
will 0
more 0
or 0
less 0
replace 0
the 0
Assembly 0
of 0
the 0
Federation. 0

In 0
October 0
2008, 0
the 0
President, 0
the 0
Religious 0
Assistant 0
and 0
a 0
Lawyer 0
were 0
in 0
Rome 0
where 0
they 0
explained 0
the 0
proposals. 0

They 0
had 0
meetings 0
with 0
Fr. 0

General 0
and 0
with 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Religious. 0

These 0
were 0
open 0
meetings 0
that 0
helped 0
us 0
to 0
clarify 0
matters. 0

An 0
important 0
concern 0
was 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
allow 0
us 0
to 0
use 0
lay 0
people 0
on 0
the 0
Federal 0
Council 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
and 0
the 0
Supervisory 0
council. 0

We 0
were 0
aware 0
that 0
we 0
were 0
not 0
dealing 0
with 0
a 0
simple 0
matter, 0
but 0
we 0
think 0
that, 0
in 0
view 0
of 0
our 0
present 0
situation 0
today, 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
have 0
much 0
choice. 0

It 0
is 0
important 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
interests 0
of 0
our 0
Federation 0
in 0
the 0
most 0
responsible 0
and 0
careful 0
way, 0
so 0
that 0
all 0
the 0
sisters, 0
even 0
those 0
advanced 0
in 0
years, 0
can 0
continue 0
to 0
live 0
their 0
life 0
in 0
Carmel. 0

Definitive 0
permission 0
came 0
at 0
the 0
25th 0
of 0
February. 0

the 0

speeches 0

at 0

Sr. 0
Enrica 0
Rosanna, 0
the 0
representative 0
of 0
the 0

are 0
“the 0

their 0
monasteries 0
alive, 0
dropping 0
a 0
hint 0
about 0
what 0
now 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
particular 0
obsession 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation. 0

Cor 0
orans 0
would 0
take 0
this 0
subject 0
up 0
definitively 0
in 0
2018: 0

The 0
nuns 0
were 0
exhorted 0
to 0
“stay 0
awake 0
to 0
welcome 0
the 0
dawn” 0
of 0
a 0
bright 0
new 0
future: 0

“These 0
are 0
difficult 0
and 0
uncertain 0
times, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
also 0
the 0
time 0
to 0
stay 0
awake 0
as 0
the 0
new 0
dawn 0
is 0
already 0
announcing 0
itself.” 0
“Our 0
aim 0
must 0
be 0
to 0
be 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
future. 0

We 0
should 0
not 0
forget 0
that 0
we 0
are 0
following 0
in 0
the 0
tradition 0
of 0
Teresa 0
of 0
Jesus 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
tradition 0
of 0
all 0
those 0
who 0
have 0
followed 0
in 0
her 0
footsteps. 0

It 0
is 0
a 0
wide 0
road 0
that 0
opens 0
up 0
before 0
us. 0

We 0
must 0
be 0
women 0
of 0
hope 0
and 0
faith. 0

We 0
must 0
always 0
believe 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
the 0
one 0
who 0
directs 0
history. 0

From 0
this 0
derives 0
our 0
task, 0
to 0
be 0
creative 0
and, 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time, 0
faithful 0
(creative 0
fidelity).” 0
[emphasis 0
in 0
the 0
original.] 0

While 0
there 0
can 0
be 0
no 0
doubt 0
that 0
the 0
impending 1
total 1
extinction 1
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
Order 0
in 0
Western 0
Europe 0
was 0
foremost 0
in 0
the 0
minds 0
of 0
the 0
nuns 0
present, 0
it 0
seems 0
that 0
the 0
issue 0
was 0
simply 0
not 0
addressed 0
out 0
loud 0
by 0
the 0
representatives 0
of 0
the 0
bureaucracy. 0

Instead, 0
Sr. 0
Enrica, 0
after 0
this 0
bizarre 0
and 0
cryptic 0
comment, 0
spoke 0
of 0
the 0
“problems 0
and 0
difficulties 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
encounter” 0
in 0
discernment 0
of 0
mostly 0
non-existent 0
vocations, 0
including 0
“consumerism, 0
modern 0
means 0
of 0
communication, 0
difficulties 0
in 0
creating 0
a 0
stable 0
personality, 0
autonomy 0
of 0
the 0
young, 0
the 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
always 0
supported, 0
the 0
ideology 0
of 0
subjectivism.” 0

What 1
are 1
these 1
people 1
smoking? 1

Given 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
three 0
years 0
or 0
more 0
from 0
the 0
abdication 0
of 0
Benedict 0
and 0
the 0
installation 0
of 0
the 0
New 0
Paradigm 0
of 0
Francis/Kasper, 0
one 0
wonders 0
what 0
this 0
“new 0
dawn” 0
was 0
actually 0
about. 0

Perhaps 0
a 0
useful 0
question 0
for 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
nuns 0
present 0
could 0
have 0
been, 0
“A 0
‘new 1
dawn’ 1
of 0
what, 0
exactly?” 0
This 0
kind 0
of 0
coded 0
language 0
has 0
been 0
popular 0
with 0
the 0
progressivist 0
faction 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
since 0
the 0
1960s, 0
when 0
the 0
expectation 0
was 0
for 0
the 0
installation 0
of 0
a 0
totally 0
new 0
Church. 0

Was 0
Sr. 0
Enrica 0
somehow 0
anticipating 0
the 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
those 0
hippie-era 0
dreams 0
in 0
the 0
years 0
to 0
come? 0

It 0
is 0
certainly 0
clear 0
from 0
Francis’ 0
first 0
acts 0
as 0
pope 0
that 0
he 0
had 0
dealing 0
with 0
conservative 0
and 0
Traditionalist 0
nuns 0
high 0
on 0
his 0
list 0
of 0
priorities. 0

His 0
first 0
appointment, 0
no 0
more 0
than 0
three 0
weeks 0
after 0
the 0
Conclave 0
was 0
Jose 0
Rodrigues 0
Carballo, 0
the 0
Religious 0
Congregation’s 0
Secretary 0
and 0
– 0
given 0
the 0
scandal 0
that 0
erupted 0
on 0
his 0
leaving 0
them 0
– 0
the 0
financial 0
wrecking 0
ball 0
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
Minor. 0

The 0
first 0
task 0
Francis 0
gave 0
Carballo 0
was 0
the 0
demolition 1
of 0
the 0
Franciscan 0
Friars 0
of 0
the 0
Immaculate. 0

Certainly 0
this 0
record 0
of 0
the 0
European 0
Carmelites’ 0
meeting 0
is 0
jammed 0
with 0
hints 0
that 0
Cor 0
orans 0
was 0
on 0
the 0
way. 0

On 0
the 0
final 0
day 0
of 0
the 0
meeting, 0
the 0
“theme 0
for 0
the 0
day” 0
was 0
offered 0
by 0
then-Father 0
General 0
Luis 0
Arostegui: 0
“Government: 0
the 0
need 0
for 0
change. 0

Autonomy 0
and 0
Association; 0
autonomy 0
and 0
Fr. 0

General; 0
other 0
solutions 0
to 0
government.” 0

The 0
devolution 0
of 0
authority 0
of 0
superiors 0
of 0
individual 0
monasteries 0
to 0
federations 0
was 0
obviously 0
on 0
someone’s 0
mind, 0
as 0
was 0
a 0
plan 0
to 0
see 0
to 0
it 0
that 0
monasteries 0
change 0
superiors 0
frequently: 0
“Essential 0
autonomy 0
can 0
fail 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
relationships 0
within 0
the 0
community: 0
abuses 0
by 0
permanent 0
superiors 0
who 0
decide 0
on 0
the 0
freedom 0
and 0
decisions 0
of 0
the 0
community,” 0
the 0
Father 0
General 0
warned. 0

And 0
there 0
were 0
certainly 0
hints 0
that 0
a 0
general 0
re-organisation 0
of 0
structures 0
of 0
authority 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
works. 0

A 0
common 0
tactic 0
of 0
politicians 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
initiate 0
changes 0
is 0
to 0
“ask 0
questions” 0
rather 0
than 0
make 0
suggestions, 0
and 0
Arostegui 0
asked 0
some 0
very 0
leading 0
questions 0
indeed 0
in 0
this 0
closing 0
address: 0

“Who 0
discerns 0
the 0
existence 0
or 0
not 0
of 0
vital 0
autonomy; 0
is 0
it 0
the 0
community 0
or 0
chosen 0
people? 0

“Are 0
there 0
instances 0
that 0
work 0
well 0
within 0
the 0
Church 0
which 0
balance 0
autonomy 0
in 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
helpful 0
in 0
these 0
situations? 0

“At 0
the 0
time 0
of 0
St. 0
Teresa 0
she 0
was 0
an 0
example 0
of 0
someone 0
balanced. 0

Stability 0
is 0
one 0
reason 0
[for 0
autonomy], 0
but 0
is 0
stability 0
understood 0
in 0
such 0
a 0
way 0
that 0
it 0
can 0
obstruct 0
the 0
spirit 0
of 0
mission 0
and 0
your 0
availability 0
to 0
the 0
Order 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
Church? 0

“The 0
valiant 0
and 0
prophetic 0
initiative 0
of 0
Pope 0
Pius 0
XII 0
to 0
create 0
Associations 0
and 0
Federations 0
opened 0
up 0
contemplative 0
life, 0
though 0
it 0
was 0
also 0
thought 0
that 0
it 0
could 0
harm 0
cloister 0
and 0
autonomy. 0

Can 0
such 0
essential 0
autonomy 0
continue 0
as 0
it 0
is? 0

“50 0
years 0
ago 0
there 0
was 0
stability. 0

How 0
do 0
we 0
conceive 0
today 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
autonomy 0
and 0
Federation-Association 0
and 0
between 0
autonomy 0
and 0
Fr. 0

General? 0

“Could 0
there 0
be 0
other 0
forms 0
of 0
government?” 0

Following 0
the 0
Father 0
General’s 0
address 0
are 0
notes 0
from 0
the 0
language 0
groups, 0
including 0
the 0
following: 0

“While 0
some 0
communities 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
their 0
autonomy 0
to 0
be 0
touched, 0
and 0
have 0
certain 0
fears 0
of 0
‘external’ 0
interference, 0
others 0
want 0
a 0
more 0
moderate 0
and 0
flexible 0
autonomy 0
that, 0
without 0
going 0
to 0
the 0
Congregation 0
would 0
have 0
a 0
juridical 0
form, 0
where 0
the 0
President 0
with 0
her 0
Council 0
can 0
intervene 0
in 0
extreme 0
cases 0
that 0
today 0
we 0
watch 0
with 0
pain, 0
our 0
hands 0
tied. 0

Though 0
we 0
want 0
these 0
legal 0
channels 0
to 0
be 0
established, 0
it 0
must 0
remain 0
clear 0
what 0
the 0
limits 0
of 0
the 0
Federation 0
Council 0
are, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
avoid 0
abuses 0
of 0
power 0
on 0
the 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
same.” 0
“...The 0
absence 0
of 0
vital 0
autonomy 0
is 0
also 0
noticed 0
when… 0
the 0
same 0
person 0
remains 0
prioress 0
for 0
years.” 0
“...We 0
need 0
criteria 0
that 0
expand 0
number 0
203 0
of 0
our 0
Constitutions 0
and 0
clarify 0
vital 0
autonomy. 0

We 0
perceive 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
shortage 0
of 0
authority 0
figures. 0

We 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
new 0
figures 0
but 0
rather 0
those 0
that 0
already 0
exist 0
(Associations, 0
[federation] 0
Presidents, 0
Provincials...) 0
be 0
empowered 0
in 0
a 0
legal 0
way 0
(canonically) 0
to 0
help 0
communities 0
in 0
difficulty, 0
for 0
the 0
mission 0
to 0
discern, 0
to 0
counsel, 0
to 0
accompany.” 0
“...We 0
are 0
also 0
concerned 0
for 0
those 0
communities 0
not 0
affiliated 0
to 0
Federations, 0
we 0
see 0
that 0
we 0
should 0
be 0
close 0
to 0
them.” 0

Maybe 0
this 0
summary 0
document 0
of 0
2009 0
can 0
give 0
us 0
an 0
idea 0
what 0
to 0
expect 0
from 0
Rome 0
in 0
2018, 0
now 0
that 0
the 0
“progressivist” 0
faction 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
is 0
in 0
the 0
ascendancy 0
and 0
is 0
free 0
to 0
act 0
without 0
restriction. 0

What 0
comes 0
clear 0
comparing 0
this 0
document 0
to 0
Cor 0
orans 0
is 0
that 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
machinery 0
has 0
long 0
been 0
at 0
work 0
forcing 0
a 0
uniform 0
and 0
essentially 0
bureaucratic, 0
heavily 0
authoritarian 0
and 0
legalistic 0
vision 0
of 0
contemplative 0
life 0
on 0
anyone 0
who 0
fails 0
sufficiently 0
to 0
resist 0
it. 0

And 0
with 0
the 0
statistics 0
offered 0
at 0
this 0
meeting 0
we 0
can 0
see 0
clearly 0
where 0
this 0
road 0
leads. 0

So 0
many 0
Catholics 0
in 0
the 0
last 0
40 0
years 0
assumed 0
that 0
under 0
the 0
“conservatives” 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
and 0
Benedict 0
XVI 0
at 0
least 0
the 0
Vatican 0
was 0
“onside.” 0
At 0
least 0
in 0
Rome 0
they 0
understood 0
the 0
terrible 1
threat 0
of 0
the 0
Bolshie 0
VaticanTwoist 0
revolutionaries. 0

But 0
this 0
report 0
of 0
2009 0
shows 0
a 0
clear 0
picture 0
of 0
a 0
Roman 0
congregation 0
determined 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
revolution 0
through 0
to 0
its 0
inevitable 0
conclusion. 0

[1] 0
An 0
aside 0
that 0
will 0
perhaps 0
be 0
noteworthy 0
to 0
traditionalist 0
readers 0
is 0
the 0
little 0
comment 0
in 0
the 0
report 0
on 0
the 0
difficulty 0
of 0
having 0
a 0
liturgical 0
observance 0
between 0
all 0
the 0
disparate 0
nations 0
represented 0
at 0
the 0
meeting. 0

“Eucharist 0
and 0
Lauds 0
in 0
Spanish. 0

Fr. 0

Isidore 0
D’Silva 0
had 0
prepared 0
a 0
booklet 0
with 0
the 0
liturgy 0
for 0
each 0
day. 0

Each 0
psalm 0
was 0
in 0
a 0
different 0
language, 0
and 0
was 0
prepared 0
by 0
the 0
corresponding 0
liturgical 0
group. 0

However, 0
having 0
the 0
text 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
us 0
made 0
it 0
easier 0
to 0
follow 0
the 0
recitation 0
in 0
other 0
languages. 0

The 0
end 0
result 0
was 0
that 0
we 0
could 0
all 0
join 0
in 0
the 0
liturgy. 0

We 0
were 0
all 0
united 0
in 0
the 0
praise 0
of 0
the 0
Spirit 0
who 0
had 0
brought 0
us 0
there 0
together 0
from 0
different 0
languages 0
and 0
nations.” 0

Solution: 0
new 0
foundations, 0
the 0
spreading 0
of 0
the 0
Carmelite 0
charism 0
into 0

This 0
includes 0

the 0

that 0
I 0
co-authored 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein, 0
we 0
would 0
have 0
done 0
better 0
to 0
speak 0
of 0
the 0
“official” 0
Latin 0
text 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
“original” 0
Latin 0
text. 0

This, 0
though, 0
is 0
no 0

an 0

because 0
the 0
normative 0
text 0
is 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
published 0
in 0
thr 0
AAS. 0

Mr. 1
Ferrara, 1
however, 1
bases 1
his 1
critique 1
upon 1
an 1
assumption 1
that 1
the 1
“generous 1
response” 1
offered 1
to 1
God 1
is 1
a 1
sin. 1

This, 1
though, 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
AL 1
is 1
saying. 1

The 0
generous 0
response 0
is 0
a 0
move 0
away 0
from 0
sin 0
and 0
a 0
move 0
toward 0
God. 0

I 0
explain 0
this 0
in 0
my 0
most 0
recent 0
response 0
to 0
Prof. 0
E. 0
Christian 0
Brugger, 0
which 0
can 0
serve 0
as 0
my 0
response 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara: 0

Posted 0

on 0
LifeSiteNews: 0

Prof. 0
Brugger 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
theologian 0
and 0
a 0
fine 0
man, 0
but 0
he 0
still 0
seems 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
AL 0
303 0
implies 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
people 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
sin 0
in 0
some 0
cases. 0

In 0
his 0
April 0
22, 0
2016 0
article 0
in 0
Catholic 0
World 0
Report, 0
Brugger 0
writes 0
that 0
AL 0
303 0
suggests 0
that 0
“God 0
can 0
be 0
‘asking’ 0
someone 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
a 0
life-state 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
objectively 0
violating 0
grave 0
matter.” 0
Then 0
in 0
a 0
Sept. 0
28 0
‘17 0
LifeSiteNews 0
article, 0
he 0
states 0
that 0
“the 0
generous 0
response” 0
owed 0
to 0
God 0
is 0
“a 0
certain 0
state 0
that 0
is 0
objectively 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
universal 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel.” 0
Now 0
Prof. 0
Brugger 0
argues 0
that, 0
because 0
the 0
subject 0
remains 0
“this 0
conscience” 0
in 0
AL 0
303, 0
this 0
proves 0
that 0
the 0
“generous 0
offering 0
owed 0
to 0
God” 0
is 0
the 0
recognition 0
that 0
one 0
is 0
living 0
“contrary 0
to 0
“the 0
universal 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel.” 0

Prof. 0

Brugger 0
fails 0
to 0
see 0
that 0
AL 0
303 0
clearly 0
distinguishes 0
between 0
a 0
conscience’s 0
recognition 0
that 0
“a 0
given 0
situation 0
is 0
objectively 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
general 0
mandate 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel” 0
and 0
this 0
same 0
conscience’s 0
subsequent 0
recognition 0
of 0
a 0
“generous 0
response 0
owed 0
to 0
God 0
in 0
the 0
present 0
circumstances.” 0
The 0
subject 0
“conscience” 0
might 0
be 0
the 0
same 0
but 0
the 0
object 0
is 0
different. 0

The 0
“generous 0
response” 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
situation 0
that 0
is 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel 0
but 0
an 0
offering 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
amid 0
the 0
mass 0
of 0
impediments 0
even 0
though 0
it 0
may 0
not 0
yet 0
be 0
the 0
perfect 0
objective 0
model. 0

What 0

might 0
be 0
this 0
“generous 0
response?” 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
does 0
not 0
give 0
an 0
example 0
in 0
AL 0
303 0
because 0
he’s 0
speaking 0
in 0
general 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
dynamics 0
of 0
conscience. 0

Moreover, 0
he 0
knows 0
that 0
concrete 0
cases 0
vary 0
widely. 0

In 0
our 0
Sept. 0
26 0
article 0
in 0
La 0
Stampa, 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein 0
and 0
I 0
provided 0
a 0
hypothetical 0
example 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
in 0
a 0
purely 0
civil 0
“marriage” 0
recognizing 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
calling 0
them 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
continence. 0

We 0
chose 0
this 0
example 0
deliberately 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
that 0
“the 0
generous 0
response” 0
could 0
be 0
the 0
ending 0
of 0
a 0
particular 0
sin. 0

Our 0
example 0
was 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
show 0
that 0
Professors 0
Brugger 0
and 0
Seifert 0
are 0
wrong 0
to 0
believe 0
AL 0
303 0
implies 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
some 0
people 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
an 0
objectively 0
sinful 0
state. 0

It’s 0
really 0
just 0
the 0
opposite. 0

AL 0
303 0
teaches 0
that 0
conscience 0
will 0
come 0
to 0
recognize 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
for 0
a 0
step 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction 0
away 0
from 0
sin. 0

Pope 1
Francis 1
explains 1
this 1
again 1
in 1
AL 1
305 1
when 1
he 1
says 1
“a 1
small 1
step, 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
great 1
human 1
limitations, 1
can 1
be 1
more 1
pleasing 1
to 1
God 1
than 1
a 1
life 1
which 1
appears 1
outwardly 1
in 1
order, 1
but 0
moves 0
through 0
the 0
day 0
without 0
confronting 0
great 0
difficulties.’” 0

In 0

a 0
recent 0
interview 0
(http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., 0
the 0
Italian 0
philosopher, 0
Rocco 0
Buttiglione, 0
provides 0
this 0
example 0
for 0
AL 0
303: 0
“Imagine 0
a 0
father 0
who 0
has 0
a 0
sick 0
son 0
and 0
the 0
child 0
improves. 0

He 0
still 0
has 0
fever 0
but 0
has 0
stopped 0
vomiting; 0
the 0
child 0
manages 0
to 0
keep 0
in 0
his 0
stomach 0
what 0
he 0
eats 0
and 0
has 0
started 0
a 0
therapy 0
that 0
seems 0
to 0
work. 0

The 0
father 0
is 0
happy. 0

Is 0
he 0
happy 0
about 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
child 0
is 0
sick? 0

No, 0
he 0
is 0
pleased 0
that 0
his 0
son 0
gives 0
symptoms 0
of 0
improvement 0
and 0
healing.” 0

This 0

is 0
what 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
is 0
saying 0
in 0
AL 0
303. 0

God 0
is 0
not 0
happy 0
with 0
situations 0
that 0
are 0
objectively 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel. 0

God, 0
however, 0
is 0
happy 0
when 0
people 0
in 0
such 0
situations 0
discern 0
in 0
conscience 0
that 0
He 0
is 0
asking 0
them 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
choice 0
that 0
moves 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction—even 0
if 0
they 0
still 0
need 0
to 0
progress 0
further 0
toward 0
a 0
more 0
complete 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
His 0
will. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
law 0
of 0
gradualness 0
not 0
the 0
gradualness 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

It 0
is 0
sad 0
that 0
this 0
beautiful 0
and 0
compassionate 0
message 0
of 0
AL 0
303 0
has 0
been 0
so 0
completely 0
misunderstood 0
by 0
scholars 0
who 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
grasp 0
its 0
true 0
meaning. 0

I 0

certainly 0
agree 0
that 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
is 0
the 0
normative 0
text 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
comes 0
later. 0

I 0
certainly 0
do 0
not 0
agree 0
that 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
eliminates 0
the 0
grave 0
problems 0
with 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

Rather, 0
as 0
I 0
show 0
in 0
my 0
article, 0
it 0
only 0
intensifies 0
them. 0

With 1

all 1
due 1
respect 1
to 1
Dr. 1
Fastiggi, 1
his 1
argument 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
Buttiglione, 1
that 1
a 1
“move 1
away 1
from 1
sin” 1
is 1
what 1
is 1
pleasing 1
to 1
God, 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
moral 1
norm 1
is 1
not 1
adhered 1
to, 1
is 1
sophistical. 1

What 0
constitutes 0
a 0
“move 0
away” 0
from 0
sin 0
if 0
not 0
ceasing 0
to 0
commit 0
the 0
sin? 0

No 0
example 0
is 0
provided 0
in 0
AL 0
because 0
none 0
can 0
be. 0

The 0
notion 0
is 0
nonsensical. 0

Just 0
how 0
nonsensical 0
is 0
demonstrated 0
by 0
Dr. 0
Fastiggi’s 0
claim 0
that 0
by 0
“a 0
move 0
away 0
from 0
sin” 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
couple 0
Francis 0
means 0
their 0
agreement 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
continence 0
as 0
brother 0
and 0
sister 0
for 0
the 0
sake 0
of 0
children. 0

But 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
ceasing 0
to 0
commit 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
adultery 0
altogether 0
as 0
it 0
would 0
involve 0
abandoning 0
the 0
pretense 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
married 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
illicit 0
sexual 0
relation 0
itself. 0

Such 0
a 0
couple 0
could 0
always 0
be 0
absolved 0
and 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
under 0
the 0
Church’s 0
constant 0
practice, 0
albeit 0
privately 0
to 0
avoid 0
scandal. 0

At 0

any 0
rate, 0
the 0
“brother 0
and 0
sister” 0
approach 0
to 0
the 0
situation, 0
which 0
is 0
that 0
of 0
Familiaris 0
consortio 0
84, 0
is 0
certainly 0
not 0
the 0
one 0
advocated 0
by 0
Francis. 0

As 0
my 0
article 0
shows, 0
Francis 0
has 0
made 0
it 0
quite 0
clear 0
that 0
he 0
approves 0
of 0
admitting 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
people 0
who 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
live 0
as 0
if 0
they 0
were 0
married, 0
including 0
sexual 0
relations, 0
while 0
“discerning” 0
their 0
situation, 0
this 0
“discernment” 0
being 0
a 0
mere 0
fig 0
leaf 0
to 0
conceal 0
the 0
proposed 0
toleration 0
of 0
public 0
adultery 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

Thus, 0
Francis 0
thanked 0
the 0
Maltese 0
bishops 0
for 0
their 0
AL 0
guidelines, 0
which 0
literally 0
mandate 0
admission 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
people 0
who 0
believe 0
themselves 0
to 0
be 0
“at 0
peace 0
with 0
God.” 0
And, 0
as 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
in 0
writing, 0
“there 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
interpretation.” 0

No 0

amount 0
of 0
verbal 0
artifice 0
can 0
conceal 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
thanks 0
to 0
AL: 0
Public 0
adulterers 0
are 0
being 0
admitted 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
without 0
an 0
amendment 0
of 0
life 0
and 0
the 0
bimillenial 0
discipline 0
of 0
the 0
Church---which 0
John 0
Paul 0
insisted 0
involves 0
a 0
moral 0
norm, 0
not 0
a 0
mere 0
ecclesiastical 0
law, 0
to 0
which 0
everyone 0
is 0
bound 0
in 0
conscience 0
“without 0
exception”---is 0
being 0
overthrown 0
in 0
place 0
after 0
place. 0

It 0

is 0
a 0
great 0
disservice 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
maintain 0
the 0
pretense 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
problematical 0
about 0
AL. 0

A 1
moral 1
catastrophe 1
is 1
self-evidently 1
underway 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
possible 1
honestly 1
to 1
deny 1

I 0

would 0
like 0
to 0
thank 0
Christopher 0
Ferrara 0
again 0
for 0
calling 0
attention 0
to 0
an 0
article 0
I 0
co-authored 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein 0
in 0
La 0
Stampa. 0

I 0
give 0
him 0
credit 0
for 0
his 0
colorful 0
style. 0

Unfortunately, 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara 0
provides 0
no 0
real 0
evidence 0
for 0
his 0
claim 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
“wishes 0
the 0
bishops 0
to 0
admit 0
public 0
adulterers 0
in 0
'second 0
marriages' 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
while 0
continuing 0
their 0
adulterous 0
relations.” 0

He 1

mentions 1
the 1
Holy 1
Father's 1
letter 1
to 1
the 1
Buenos 1
Aires 1
bishops, 1
but 1
he 1
fails 1
to 1
take 1
into 1
account 1
that 1
the 1
statement 1
of 1
those 1
Argentine 1
bishops 1
can 1
be 1
interpreted 1
in 1
an 1
orthodox 1
way, 1
as 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
told 0
Edward 0
Pentin 0
in 0
a 0
Sept. 0
28 0
interview 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
National 0
Catholic 0
Register. 0

In 0
fact 0
the 0
statement 0
of 0
the 0
Argentine 0
bishops 0
only 0
speaks 0
of 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
“access 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist.” 0
This 0
could 0
reasonably 0
be 0
interpreted 0
as 0
going 0
to 0
confession 0
before 0
receiving 0
Holy 0
Communion. 0

The 0

same 0
applies 0
to 0
statements 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
Cardinal 0
Schoenborn 0
mentioned 0
by 0
Ferrara. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
defers 0
to 0
the 0
exposition 0
of 0
Amoris 0
laetitia 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Schoenborn 0
given 0
in 0
April 0
2016 0
when 0
the 0
exhortation 0
was 0
made 0
public. 0

I 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
Cardinal's 1
exposition 1
in 1
both 1
Italian 1
and 1
English, 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
find 1
mention 1
of 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
sacraments 1
in 1
certain 1
cases. 1

Once 0
again, 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara 0
assumes 0
this 0
means 0
access 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
without 0
prior 0
sacramental 0
confession. 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
letter 0
thanking 0
the 0
Bishops 0
of 0
Malta, 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
Edward 0
Pentin 0
mentions 0
a 0
letter 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Baldiserri 0
not 0
a 0
letter 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

Moreover, 0
this 0
letter 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
made 0
public 0
so 0
we 0
don't 0
know 0
exactly 0
what 0
it 0
says 0
other 0
than 0
an 0
expression 0
of 0
thanks. 0

This 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
thin 0
evidence 0
for 0
claiming 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
wishes 0
the 0
bishops 0
to 0
admit 0
public 0
adulterers 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
while 0
continuing 0
in 0
their 0
adulterous 0
relations. 0

As 0
a 0
lawyer, 0
Ferrara 0
should 0
have 0
a 0
better 0
sense 0
of 0
what 0
really 0
counts 0
as 0
evidence. 0

As 0
a 0
Christian, 0
he 0
should 0
also 0
be 0
mindful 0
of 0
the 0
command 0
against 0
bearing 0
false 0
witness. 0

Beyond 0

these 0
considerations, 0
I 0
wish 0
to 0
express 0
a 0
personal 0
concern 0
I 0
have 0
about 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara's 0
standing 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

He 0
says 0
that 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein 0
and 0
I 0
are 0
“foot 1
soldiers 1
of 1
a 1
Leviathan 1
Church” 1
because 0
we 0
defend 0
the 0
Roman 0
Pontiff. 0

Does 1
Mr. 1
Ferrara 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
under 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
is 1
a 1
“Leviathan 1
Church” 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church? 1

If 1
this 1
is 1
so, 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
suggest 1
that 1
Mr. 1
Ferrara 1
is 1
refusing 1
submission 1
to 1
the 1
Roman 1
Pontiff 1
and 1
communion 1
with 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
subject 1
to 1
him. 1

This, 0
though, 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
schism 0
found 0
in 0
the 0

I 0
hope 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara 0
can 0
clarify 0
what 0
he 0
means 0
by 0
the 0
“Leviathan 0
Church” 0
under 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

A 0
more 0
simple 0
question 0
to 0
him 0
would 0
be 0
this: 0
“Are 0
you 0
refusing 0
submission 0
to 0
the 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
or 0
communion 0
with 0
the 0
members 0
subject 0
to 0
him?” 0

I 0

apologize 0
ahead 0
of 0
time 0
if 0
I 0
misconstrued 0
his 0
words. 0

I 0
believe, 0
though, 0
my 0
question 0
is 0
reasonable 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
his 0
reference 0
to 0
a 0
“Leviathan 0
Church” 0
distinct 0
from 0
“the 0
dictates 0
of 0
the 0
Immortal 0
God 0
in 0
heaven.” 0

If 0

Dr. 0
Fastiggi 0
wishes 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
pretend, 0
despite 0
a 0
growing 0
mountain 0
of 0
evidence, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
not 0
in 0
fact 0
approved 0
of 0
the 0
admission 0
of 0
public 0
adulterers 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion--just 0
as 0
he 0
did 0
when 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
and 0
just 0
as 0
he 0
did 0
with 0
the 0
woman 0
he 0
telephoned 0
in 0
Argentina—then 0
I 0
cannot 0
help 0
him. 0

As 0

for 0
my 0
metaphorical 0
reference 0
to 0
a 0
“Leviathan 0
Church,” 0
I 0
am 0
afraid 0
Dr. 1
Fastiggi 1
has 1
succumbed 1
to 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
literal-mindedness. 1

To 0
make 0
it 0
clear 0
for 0
him, 0
I 0
am 0
contending 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
co-author 0
treat 0
the 0
Pope 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
were 0
the 0
absolute 0
ruler 0
of 0
Hobbes’s 0
Leviathan. 0

I 0
do 0
not, 0
as 0
should 0
be 0
obvious, 0
argue 0
that 0
this 0
Leviathan 0
Church 0
actually 0
exists. 0

That 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
and 0
cannot 0
exist 0
is 0
precisely 0
my 0
point. 0

Dr. 0

Fastiggi’s 0
inapt 0
citation 0
to 0
Canon 0
751 0
and 0
his 0
clumsy 0
and 0
insulting 0
questions 0
about 0
my 0
“standing 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church” 0
and 0
whether 0
I 0
am 0
“refusing 0
submission 0
to 0
the 0
Roman 0
Pontiff” 0
demonstrate 1
a 1
pronounced 1
lack 1
of 1
comprehension 1
of 1
pertinent 1
ecclesiological 1
and 1
theological 1
basics, 1
and 1
a 1
rather 1
embarrassing 1
lack 1
of 1
rhetorical 1
finesse. 1

Raising 0
objections 0
to 0
a 0
papal 0
document 0
because 0
it 0
appears 0
to 0
depart 0
from 0
sound 0
orthodoxy 0
is 0
hardly 0
“refusing 0
submission 0

the 0

who 0

not, 0
at 0
any 0
rate, 0
actually 0
commanded 0
anyone 0
to 0
“submit” 0
to 0
anything 0
via 0
AL. 0

I 1

respectfully 1
suggest 1
that 1
Dr. 1
Fastiggi’s 1
comments 1
evince 1
a 1
need 1
for 1
serious 1

The 1
Mueller 1
Circus 1

Over, 1
Long 1
Live 1
the 1
Mueller 1
Circus 1

The 1
Mueller 1
circus 1
cost 0
the 0
taxpayers 0
millions. 0

But 1
it 1
made 1
the 1
media 1
ten 1
times 1
that 1
more. 1

The 0
fortunes 0
that 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
made 0
on 0
Mueller 0
leaks 0
and 0
conspiracy 0
theories 0
are 0
priceless. 1

The 0
Mueller 0
report 0
with 0
its 0
inevitable 1
lies, 1
smears 0
and 0
assaults 0
from 0
the 0
Obama/Clinton 0
team 0
behind 0
the 1
grim 1
face 1
of 0
Robert 0
Mueller 0
is 0
in. 0

The 0
media 0
won't 0
leave 0
it 0
there. 0

After 0
running 0
through 0
the 0
entire 0
process 0
of 0
making 0
the 0
report 0
public 0
which, 0
one 0
way 0
or 0
another, 0
it 0
will 0
be, 0
it 0
will 0
fasten 0
on 0
the 0
various 0
state 0
investigations 0
targeting 0
Trump, 0
his 0
family 0
members, 0
his 0
associates 0
and 0
anyone 0
who 0
ever 0
met 0
him 0
since 0
1989. 0

These 0
investigations 0
will 0
vie 0
for 0
status. 0

Some 0
will 0
employ 0
former 0
Mueller 0
coup 0
members. 0

They 0
will 0
be 0
used 0
by 0
the 0
Democrats 0
running 0
them 0
to 0
fundraise, 0
in 0
violation 0
of 0
all 0
political 0
norms 0
and 0
ethics, 0
bringing 0
us 0
that 0
much 0
closer 0
to 0
a 1
proper 1
Roman 1
circus. 1

The 0
three 0
goals 0
of 0
all 0
this 0
are 0
simple. 0

1. 0

Keep 0
the 0
media 0
happy 0
and 0
profitable 0

2. 0

Undermine 1
President 0
Trump 0
and 0
prevent 0
him 0
from 0
implementing 0
reforms. 0

3. 0

Punish 0
the 0
voting 0
public 0
for 0
electing 0
Trump 0

Never 0
underestimate 0
the 0
power 0
of 0
the 1
swamp's 1
spite. 1

Much 0
of 0
this 0
is 0
about 0
self-defense. 0

The 0
more 0
Trump 0
is 0
investigated, 0
the 0
less 0
he 0
can 0
investigate, 0
reform 0
or 0
implement 0
changes 0
to 0
the 0
swamp. 1

But 0
plenty 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
about 0
malice 1
and 1
spite. 1

Culture 0
wars 0
are 0
built 0
on 0
tribal 1
rage. 1

That's 0
what 0
the 0
"resistance" 0
has 0
always 0
been 0
about. 0

Foolish 1
Religion 1
Author 1
Gary 1
Wills: 1
‘The 0
Religion 0
of 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
Is 0
a 0
Religion 0
of 0
Peace’ 0

Outside 0
of 0
specialists 0
and 0
seekers, 0
the 1
only 1
reason 1
why 1
there 1
is 1
general 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
Qur’an 1
among 1
non-Muslims 1
is 1
to 1
seek 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
it 1
justifies 1
and 1
encourages 1
Islamic 1
terrorism. 1

With 0
What 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
Meant: 0
And 0
Why 0
It 0
Matters, 0
religion 0
author 0
Garry 0
Wills 0
is 0
here 0
to 0
reassure 0
us: 0

What 0
did 0
the 0
scripture 0
of 0
Islam 0
tell 0
me 0
about 0
the 1
duty 1
to 1
kill 1
infidels? 1

Some 0
people 0
are 0
sure 0
it 0
is 0
there, 0
though 0
it 0
isn’t. 0

Then 0
what 0
does 0
it 0
say 0
about 0
Shari’ah 0
law? 0

Not 0
a 0
thing 0
(p. 0
7). 0

That 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
to 1
know, 1
were 1
Wills 1
a 1
reliable 1
witness. 1

Unfortunately, 1
he 1
proves 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
the 1
opposite: 1
Wills 0
laments 0
“Robert 0
Spencer 0
of 0
Jihad 0
Watch 0
calling 0
for 0
a 0
ban 0
on 0
the 0
Qur’an” 0
(p. 0
58). 0

I 0
have 0
never 0
called 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
ban, 0
and 0
oppose 0
in 0
principle 0
the 0
banning 0
of 0
any 0
book. 0

Wills, 1
not 1
surprisingly, 1
does 1
not 1
offer 1
any 1
quotation 1
from 1
me 1
to 1
back 1
up 1
his 1
false 1
claim. 1

His 0
manifest 0
unreliability 0
on 0
this 0
point 0
casts 0
a 0
shadow 0
on 0
his 0
primary 0
assertions 0
about 0
the 0
Qur’an. 0

Wills 0
seems 0
determined 0
to 0
put 0
the 1
best 1
possible 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
Qur’an, 1
which 0
requires 0
him 0
to 0
ignore 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
Qur’anic 0
incitement 1
and 1
hatred. 1

For 0
example, 0
he 0
quotes 0
5:51 0
-- 0
“You 0
who 0
believe, 0
do 0
not 0
take 0
the 0
Jews 0
and 0
Christians 0
as 0
allies” 0
(p. 0
114) 0
-- 0
but 0
he 0
nonetheless 0
concludes, 0
after 0
ten 0
pages 0
of 0
tu 1
quoque 1
arguments 1
and 0
other 0
legerdemain, 1
that 0
“the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
fraternal 0
in 0
its 0
treatment 0
of 0
other 0
faiths” 0
(p. 0
124). 0

Wills 1
never 1
mentions 1
Qur’an 1
9:29, 1
which 1
commands 1
Muslims 1
to 1
wage 1
war 1
against 1
Jews 1
and 1
Christians 1
and 1
subjugate 1
them 1
as 1
inferiors 1
under 1
the 1
rule 1
of 1
Sharia. 1

Wills 1
is 1
no 1
more 1
trustworthy 1
when 1
he 1
deals 1
with 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
violence 1
in 1
the 1
Qur’an. 1

He 0
renders 0
one 0
key 0
passage 0
in 0
this 0
way: 0
“Fight 0
then 0
until 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
more 0
persecution, 0
and 0
worship 0
[at 0
the 0
shrine] 0
is 0
devoted 0
to 0
God” 0
(2:193; 0
p. 0
133). 0

Whence 0
the 0
bracketed 0
interpolation 0
“at 0
the 0
shrine”? 0

Wills 1
doesn’t 1
give 1
any 1
source 1
for 1
it; 1
apparently 0
it 0
comes 0
from 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Garry 0
Wills 0
himself. 0

By 0
adding 0
“at 0
the 0
shrine” 0
to 0
this 0
verse, 0
Wills 0
restricts 0
the 0
call 0
to 0
fight 0
to 0
the 0
area 0
around 0
the 0
Sacred 0
Mosque 0
in 0
Mecca. 0

He 1
ignores 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
some 1
Islamic 1
authorities 1
see 1
this 1
passage 1
as 1
calling 1
for 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
unlimited 1
warfare 1
against 1
non-Muslims. 1

The 0
prominent 0
Twentieth 0
Century 0
Indian 0
Islamic 0
scholar 0
Muhammad 0
Ashiq 0
Ilahi 0
Bulandshahri 0
explains 0
the 0
passage 0
this 0
way: 0

The 0
worst 1
of 1
sins 1
are 0
Infidelity 0
( 0
Kufr) 0
and 0
Polytheism 0
( 0
shirk) 0
which 0
constitute 0
rebellion 0
against 0
Allah, 0
The 0
Creator. 0

To 1
eradicate 1
these, 1
Muslims 1
are 1
required 1
to 1
wage 1
war 1
until 1
there 1
exists 1
none 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
world, 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
religion 1
is 1
that 1
of 1
Allah. 1

Wills 1
doesn’t 1
mention 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
such 1
interpretations, 1
even 1
to 1
dismiss 1
them. 1

Likewise, 1
when 1
he 1
claims 1
that 1
the 1
Qur’an 1
has 1
“not 1
a 1
thing” 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
Sharia, 1
he 1
appears 1
unaware 1
that 1
the 1
Qur’an 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sources 1
of 1
Sharia. 1

The 0
Qur’an’s 0
declarations 0
that 0
a 0
woman’s 0
testimony 0
is 0
worth 0
half 0
that 0
of 0
a 0
man’s 0
(2:282), 0
that 0
a 0
daughter 0
is 0
to 0
receive 0
a 0
smaller 0
part 0
of 0
an 0
inheritance 0
than 0
a 0
son 0
receives 0
(4:11), 0
that 0
thieves 0
are 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
hands 0
amputated 0
(5:38), 0
and 0
that 0
those 0
who 0
“wage 0
war 0
against 0
Allah 0
and 0
his 0
messenger” 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
crucified 0
or 0
have 0
a 0
hand 0
and 0
foot 0
amputated 0
on 0
opposite 0
sides 0
(5:33) 0
are 0
part 0
of 0
Sharia 0
in 0
all 0
its 0
various 0
expressions. 0

Because 0
these 0
stipulations 0
are 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
Qur’an, 0
they 0
cannot 0
be 0
questioned 0
or 0
set 0
aside. 0

Throughout 0
his 0
book, 0
Wills’ 0
assurances 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
not 0
really 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
“right-wing 1
Islamophobes” 1
say, 0
or 0
that 0
the 1
Bible 1
contains 1
material 1
that 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
bad 1
or 1
worse, 1
dissolve 0
under 0
close 0
scrutiny. 0

Again 1
and 1
again 1
it 1
turns 1
out 1
that 1
Wills 1
has 1
ignored 1
key 1
passages 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
case. 1

He 0
asks 0
why 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
“so 1
ferocious 1
to 0
‘hypocrites’ 1
and 0
apostates” 0
(p. 0
124). 0

Then 0
he 0
offers 0
a 0
quotation 0
from 0
the 0
New 0
Testament 0
Letter 0
to 0
the 0
Hebrews 0
saying 0
that 0
“if 0
we 0
sin 0
again 0
on 0
purpose” 0
there 0
is 0
“only 0
a 1
terrifying 1
judgment 1
to 0
come” 0
(p. 0
126). 0

Wills 0
concludes: 0
“The 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
not 0
as 0
absolute 0
as 0
this, 0
because 0
it 0
always 0
leaves 0
room 0
for 0
God’s 0
inexhaustible 1
mercy 1
and 1
forgiveness” 1
(p. 0
126). 0

That 1
sounds 1
wonderful, 1
and 0
certainly 0
pleasing 0
to 0
multicultural 0
ears 0
to 0
learn 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
more 0
merciful 0
than 0
the 0
New 0
Testament. 0

Until 0
one 0
realizes 0
that, 0
in 0
his 0
discussion 0
of 0
apostasy 0
in 0
the 0
Qur’an, 0
Wills 1
has 1

all 1

one 1

as 1
Garry 1

it 1
out 1
to 1
be, 1
why 1
do 1
so 1
very 1
many 1

it? 1

How 1
would 1
Garry 1
Wills 1
explain 1
all 1
that? 1

He 1
can’t; 1
he 0
has 0
just 0
explained 0
all 0
Qur’anic 0
violence 1
and 0
intolerance 0
away, 0
leaving 0
the 0
manifest 0
fact 0
that 0
all 0
too 0
many 0
Muslims 0
worldwide 0
think 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
says 0
exactly 0
what 0
he 0
claims 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
say 0

Wills’ 1
naïve, 1
inaccurate, 1
misleadingly 1
sunny 1
view 1
of 1
the 1

accords 0
with 0
that 0
of 0
his 0
fellow 0
Leftist 1
Catholic, 1

proclaimedpreposterously 1
that 0
“authentic 0

Koran 0
are 0
opposed 0
to 0

Wills’ 0

well 0
with 0
the 0
present-day 0
Catholic 0

head-in-the-sand 1
posture 1
toward 1

it 1
feels 1
good, 1

for 1

that 1

At 0

expressed 0
concern 0
that 0

broken 0
its 0
word 0
with 0
Rombot 0
after 0
telling 0
him 0
in 0
2015 0
that 0

would 0
"be 0

before 0
being 0

She 0
also 0
expressed 0
concern 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
held 0
alongside 0
potentially 0
violent 0
criminals. 0

Her 0
problem 0
though 0
was 0
that 0
the 0
law 0
and 0
precedent 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
side 0
of 0
the 0
continued 0
deportation 0
of 0
aliens. 0

Kritarch 0
Saris 0
has 0
apparently 0
seen 0
the 0
SCOTUS 0
writing 0
on 0
the 0

and 0
perhaps 0
had 1
an 1
attack 1
of 1
her 1
legal 1
conscience 1

decided 0
that 0
she 0
will 0
acquiesce 0

has 0
apparently 0
decided 0
to 0
bend 0
to 0
the 0
inevitable 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Indonesians, 0
who 0
had 0
years 0

all 0

do 0

not 1

we 0

here 0

that 0

realized 0
she 0

she 0
will 0

her 0

in 0
the 0
works 0
by 0
attempting 0
to 0

so 0
they 0
can 0

follow-up 0
testimony 0
from 0
arguably 0
the 1
most 1
courageous 1
prelate 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
today—Archbishop 1
Carlo 1
Maria 1
Viganò. 1

The 0
former 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has, 0
as 0
they 0
say, 0
doubled 0
down. 0

Far 0
from 0
backing-away 0
and 0
making 0
excuses 0
for 0
his 0
early 0
actions, 0
as 0
we’ve 0
all 0
become 0
so 0
accustomed 0
to 0
seeing 0
in 0
these 0
rare 0
cases 0
where 0
a 0
hierarch 0
breaks 0
ranks, 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
is 0
digging 0
in 0
with 0
a 1
4-page 1
bombshell 1
that 0
restates 0
his 0
initial 0
accusations 0
of 0
abuse 0
cover-up 0
against 0
Francis 0
and 0
other 0
powerful 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchy, 0
and 0
even 0
concludes 0
with 0
a 0
suggestion 0
that 0
Francis 0
is 0
beginning 0
to 0
act 0
as 0
a 1
“substitute 1
of 1
our 1
Lord.” 1

Read 0
the 0
Archbishop’s 0
words 0
for 0
yourselves 0
and 0
note 0
well 0
the 0
ring 0
of 0
truth 0
that 0
resonates 0
in 0
every 0
sentence. 0

This 1
is 1
clearly 1
the 1
testimony 1
of 1
an 1
honest 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
only 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
his 1
heart—a 1
modern-day 1
Athanasius 1
standing 1
against 1
something 1
so 1
much 1
worse 1
than 1
Liberius. 1

Friends, 0
let 0
us 0
pray 0
for 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò. 0

He 0
is 0
standing 0
alone 0
now, 0
and 0
not 0
only 0
against 0
the 1
most 1
dangerous 1
pontificate 1
in 1
history, 1
but 0
also 0
the 1
forces 1
of 1
hell 1
itself—forces 0
which 0
will 0
do 0
all 0
in 0
their 0
power 0
to 0
silence 0
this 0
voice 1
crying 1
in 1
the 1
wilderness. 1

Make 0
no 0
mistake 0
about 0
this: 0
Archbishop 1
Viganò 1
is 1
fighting 1
for 1
the 1
very 1
survival 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
element 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church. 1

He 0
is 0
standing 0
against 0
corrupt 0
men 0
in 0
high 0
places 0
who 0
cannot 0
be 0
trusted 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
is 0
best 0
for 0
souls, 0
for 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
or 0
indeed 0
for 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
Church 0
herself. 0

The 1
enemy 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
gates 1
but 1
has 1
now 1
made 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
thrones 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
the 1
seats 1
of 1
the 1
Apostles. 1

God 1
help 1
us. 1

It 0
goes 0
without 0
saying 0
that 0
we 0
here 0
at 0
The 0
Remnant 0
not 0
only 0
stand 0
with 0
Viganò 0
but 0
we 0
thank 0
God 0
for 0
him 0
every 0
day, 0
we 0
pray 0
the 0
Rosary 0
for 0
him 0
every 0
day, 0
and 0
wish 1
him 1
every 1
blessing 1
and 1
heavenly 1
consolation 1
as 1
he 1
undergoes 1
this 1
passion 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
Master 1
he 1
serves 1
so 1
well. 1

God 0
bless 0
you, 0
Your 0
Excellency, 0
and 0
Mary 0

you. 0

We 0

***** 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
month 0
since 0
I 0
offered 0
my 0
testimony, 0
solely 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
regarding 0
what 0
occurred 0
at 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
and 0
regarding 0
certain 0
matters 0
I 0
was 0
given 0
to 0
know 0
in 0
the 0
assignments 0
entrusted 0
to 0
me 0
at 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State 0
and 0
in 0
Washington, 0
in 0
relation 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
bear 0
responsibility 0
for 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
crimes 0
committed 0
by 0
the 0
former 0
archbishop 0
of 0
that 0
capital. 0

My 0
decision 0
to 0
reveal 0
those 0
grave 0
facts 0
was 0
for 0
me 0
the 1
most 1
painful 1
and 1
serious 1
decision 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
made 1
in 1
my 1
life. 1

I 0
made 0
it 0
after 0
long 0
reflection 0
and 0
prayer, 0
during 1
months 1
of 1
profound 1
suffering 1
and 1
anguish, 1
during 1
a 1
crescendo 1
of 1
continual 1
news 1
of 1
terrible 1
events, 1
with 1
thousands 1
of 1
innocent 1
victims 1
destroyed 1
and 1
the 1
vocations 1
and 1
lives 1
of 1
young 1
priests 1
and 1
religious 1

The 0
silence 0
of 0
the 0
pastors 0
who 0
could 0
have 0
provided 0
a 0
remedy 0
and 0
prevented 0
new 0
victims 0
became 0
increasingly 0
indefensible, 0
a 1
devastating 1
crime 1
for 1
the 1
Church. 1

Well 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
enormous 0
consequences 0
that 0
my 0
testimony 0
could 0
have, 0
because 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
reveal 0
involved 0
the 0
successor 0
of 0
Peter 0
himself, 0
I 0
nonetheless 0
chose 0
to 0
speak 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
I 0
declare 0
with 0
a 0
clear 0
conscience 0
before 0
God 0
that 0
my 0
testimony 0
is 0
true. 0

Christ 0
died 0
for 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
Peter, 0
Servus 0
servorum 0
Dei, 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
one 0
called 0
to 0
serve 0
the 0
spouse 0
of 0
Christ. 0

Certainly, 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
to 0
reveal 0
were 0
covered 0
by 0
the 0
pontifical 0
secret 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
promised 0
to 0
observe 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
faithfully 0
observed 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
my 0
service 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

But 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
any 0
secret, 0
including 0
the 0
pontifical 0
secret, 0
is 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
Church 0
from 0
her 0
enemies, 0
not 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
and 0
become 0
complicit 0
in 0
crimes 0
committed 0
by 0
some 0
of 0
her 0
members. 0

I 0
was 0
a 0
witness, 0
not 0
by 0
my 0
choice, 0
of 0
shocking 1
facts 1
and, 0
as 0
the 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
states 0
(par. 0

2491), 0
the 0
seal 0
of 0
secrecy 0
is 0
not 0
binding 0
when 0
very 0
grave 0
harm 0
can 0
be 0
avoided 0
only 0
by 0
divulging 0
the 0
truth. 0

Only 0
the 0
seal 0
of 0
confession 0
could 0
have 0
justified 0
my 0
silence. 0

Neither 0
the 0
pope, 0
nor 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
cardinals 0
in 0
Rome 0
have 0
denied 0
the 0
facts 0
I 0
asserted 0
in 0
my 0
testimony. 0

“Qui 0
tacet 0
consentit” 0
surely 0
applies 0
here, 0
for 0
if 0
they 0
deny 0
my 0
testimony, 0
they 0
have 0
only 0
to 0
say 0
so, 0
and 0
provide 0
documentation 0
to 0
support 0
that 0
denial. 0

How 1
can 1
one 1
avoid 1
concluding 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
provide 1
the 1
documentation 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
know 1
it 1
confirms 1
my 1
testimony? 1

The 0
center 0
of 0
my 0
testimony 0
was 0
that 0
since 0
at 0
least 0
June 0
23, 0
2013, 0
the 0
pope 0
knew 0
from 0
me 0
how 1
perverse 1
and 1
evil 1
McCarrick 0
was 0
in 0
his 0
intentions 0
and 0
actions, 0
and 0
instead 1
of 1
taking 1
the 1
measures 1
that 1
every 1
good 1
pastor 1
would 1
have 1
taken, 1
the 1
pope 1
made 1
McCarrick 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
principal 1
agents 1
in 1
governing 1
the 1
Church, 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
the 1
United 1
States, 1
the 1
Curia, 1
and 1
even 1
China, 1
as 1
we 1
are 1
seeing 1
these 1
days 1
with 1
great 1
concern 1
and 1
anxiety 1
for 1
that 1
martyr 1
Church. 1

Now, 1
the 1
pope’s 1
reply 1
to 1
my 1
testimony 1
was: 1
“I 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word!” 1
But 1
then, 1
contradicting 1
himself, 1
he 1
has 1
compared 1
his 1
silence 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
Jesus 1
in 1
Nazareth 1
and 1
before 1
Pilate, 1
and 0
compared 0
me 0
to 0
the 1
great 1
accuser, 1
Satan, 1
who 1
sows 1
scandal 1
and 1
division 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
— 0
though 0
without 0
ever 0
uttering 0
my 0
name. 0

If 0
he 0
had 0
said: 0
“Viganò 0
lied,” 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
challenged 0
my 0
credibility 0
while 0
trying 0
to 0
affirm 0
his 0
own. 0

In 0
so 0
doing 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
intensified 0
the 0
demand 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
God 0
and 0
the 0
world 0
for 0
the 0
documentation 0
needed 0
to 0
determine 0
who 0
has 0
told 0
the 0
truth. 0

Instead, 0
he 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
a 0
subtle 0
slander 0
against 0
me 0
— 0
slander 0
being 0
an 0
offense 0
he 0
has 0
often 0
compared 0
to 0
the 0
gravity 0
of 0
murder. 0

Indeed, 0
he 0
did 0
it 0
repeatedly, 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
celebration 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
Holy 0
Sacrament, 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
where 0
he 0
runs 0
no 0
risk 0
of 0
being 0
challenged 0
by 0
journalists. 0

When 0
he 0
did 0
speak 0
to 0
journalists, 0
he 0
asked 0
them 0
to 0
exercise 0
their 0
professional 0
maturity 0
and 0
draw 0
their 0
own 0
conclusions. 0

But 1
how 1
can 1
journalists 1
discover 1
and 1
know 1
the 1
truth 1
if 1
those 1
directly 1
involved 1
with 1
a 1
matter 1
refuse 1
to 1
answer 1
any 1
questions 1
or 1
to 1
release 1
any 1
documents? 1

The 1
pope’s 1
unwillingness 1
to 1
respond 1
to 1
my 1
charges 1
and 1
his 1
deafness 1
to 1
the 1
appeals 1
by 1
the 1
faithful 1
for 1
accountability 1
are 1
hardly 1
consistent 1
with 1
his 1
calls 1
for 1
transparency 1
and 1
bridge 1
building. 1

Moreover, 0
the 0
pope’s 0
cover-up 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
clearly 0
not 0
an 0
isolated 0
mistake. 0

Many 1
more 1
instances 1
have 1
recently 1
been 1
documented 1
in 1
the 1
press, 1
showing 1
that 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
has 1
defended 1
homosexual 1
clergy 1
who 1
committed 1
serious 1
sexual 1
abuses 1
against 1
minors 1
or 1
adults. 1

These 0
include 0
his 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Fr. 0

Julio 0
Grassi 0
in 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
his 0
reinstatement 0
of 0
Fr. 0

Mauro 0
Inzoli 0
after 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
removed 0
him 0
from 0
ministry 0
(until 0
he 0
went 0
to 0
prison, 0
at 0
which 0
point 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
laicized 0
him), 0
and 0
his 0
halting 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
of 0
sex 0
abuse 0
allegations 0
against 0
Cardinal 0
Cormac 0
Murphy 0
O’Connor. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
a 0
delegation 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
headed 0
by 0
its 0
president 0
Cardinal 0
DiNardo, 0
went 0
to 0
Rome 0
asking 0
for 0
a 0
Vatican 0
investigation 0
into 0
McCarrick. 0

Cardinal 0
DiNardo 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
prelates 0
should 0
tell 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
America 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
world: 0
did 1
the 1
pope 1
refuse 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
a 1
Vatican 1
investigation 1
into 1
McCarrick’s 1
crimes 1
and 1
of 1
those 1
responsible 1
for 1
covering 1
them 1
up? 1

The 1
faithful 1
deserve 1
to 1
know. 1

I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
special 0
appeal 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Ouellet, 0
because 0
as 0
nuncio 0
I 0
always 0
worked 0
in 0
great 0
harmony 0
with 0
him, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
always 0
had 0
great 0
esteem 0
and 0
affection 0
towards 0
him. 0

He 0
will 0
remember 0
when, 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
my 0
mission 0
in 0
Washington, 0
he 0
received 0
me 0
at 0
his 0
apartment 0
in 0
Rome 0
in 0
the 0
evening 0
for 0
a 0
long 0
conversation. 0

At 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
pontificate, 0
he 0
had 0
maintained 0
his 0
dignity, 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
shown 0
with 0
courage 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Québec. 0

Later, 0
however, 0
when 0
his 0
work 0
as 0
prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
was 0
being 0
undermined 0
because 0
recommendations 0
for 0
episcopal 0
appointments 0
were 0
being 0
passed 0
directly 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
by 0
two 1
homosexual 1
“friends” 1
of 1
his 1
dicastery, 1
bypassing 0
the 0
Cardinal, 0
he 0
gave 0
up. 0

His 1
long 1
article 1
in 1
L’Osservatore 1
Romano, 1
in 1
which 1
he 1
came 1
out 1
in 1
favor 1
of 1
the 1
more 1
controversial 1
aspects 1
of 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia, 1
represents 1
his 1
surrender. 1

Your 0
Eminence, 0
before 0
I 0
left 0
for 0
Washington, 0
you 0
were 0
the 0
one 0
who 0
told 0
me 0
of 0
Pope 0
Benedict’s 0
sanctions 0
on 0
McCarrick. 0

You 0
have 0
at 0
your 0
complete 0
disposal 0
key 0
documents 0
incriminating 0
McCarrick 0
and 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
curia 0
for 0
their 0
cover-ups. 0

Your 0
Eminence, 0
I 0
urge 0
you 0
to 0
bear 0
witness 0
to 0
the 0
truth. 0

***** 0

Finally, 0
I 1
wish 1
to 1
encourage 1
you, 1
dear 1
faithful, 1
my 1
brothers 1
and 1
sisters 1
in 1
Christ: 1
never 0
be 0
despondent! 0

Make 1
your 1
own 1
the 1
act 1
of 1
faith 1
and 1
complete 1
confidence 1
in 1
Christ 1
Jesus, 1
our 1
Savior, 1
of 1
Saint 1
Paul 1
in 1
his 1
second 1
Letter 1
to 1
Timothy, 1
Scio 1
cui 1
credidi, 1
which 1
I 1
choose 1
as 1
my 1
episcopal 1
motto. 1

This 1
is 1
a 1
time 1
of 1
repentance, 1
of 1
conversion, 1
of 1
prayers, 1
of 1
grace, 1
to 1
prepare 1
the 1
Church, 1
the 1
bride 1
of 1
the 1
Lamb, 1
ready 1
to 1
fight 1
and 1
win 1
with 1
Mary 1
the 1
battle 1
against 1
the 1
old 1
dragon. 1

For 0
any 0

the 0

by 0
Trump-appointed 1
Judge 0
Timothy 0

Kelly 0
was 0
nothing 1

“We 0
would 0
have 0
greatly 0
preferred 0
to 0
continue 0
hosting 0
White 0
House 0
press 0
conferences 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
a 0
set 0
of 0
understood 0
professional 0
norms, 0
and 0
we 0
believe 0
the 0
overwhelming 0
majority 0
of 0
journalists 0
covering 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
share 0
that 0
preference,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“But, 0
given 0
the 0
position 0
taken 0
by 0
CNN, 0
we 0
now 0
feel 0
obligated 0
to 0
replace 0
previously 0
shared 0
practices 0
with 0
explicit 0
rules.” 0

Oh, 0
but 0
there's 0
more. 0

If 0
journalists 0
can't 0
conduct 0
themselves 0
according 0
to 0
these 0
rules, 0
then 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
option 0
but 0
to.... 0
write 0
more 0
explicit 0
rules! 0

Seriously! 1

“At 0
this 0
time, 0
however, 0
we 0
have 0
decided 0
not 0
to 0
frame 0
such 0
rules 0
in 0
the 0
hope 0
that 0
professional 0
journalistic 0
norms 0
will 0
suffice 0
to 0
regulate 0
conduct 0
in 0
those 0
places,” 0
Sanders 0
said. 0

“If 0
unprofessional 0
behavior 0
occurs 0
in 0
those 0
settings, 0
or 0
if 0
a 0
court 0
should 0
decide 0
that 0
explicit 0
rules 0
are 0
required 0
to 0
regulate 0
conduct 0
there, 0
we 0
will 0
be 0
forced 0
to 0
reconsider 0
this 0
decision.” 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
should 0
be 0
telling 0
Judge 0
Kelly 0
where 0
he 0
can 0
take 0
his 0
ruling, 0
but 0
they 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
look 0
like 0
they 0
are 0
on 0
the 0
high 0
ground 0
while 0
submitting 0
to 0
unconstitutional 0
rulings 0
from 0
a 0
federal 0
judge 0
who 0
should 0
know 0
better. 0

However, 0
here 0
are 0
the 0
new 0
rules 0
released 0
by 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Office. 0

(1) 0
A 0
journalist 0
called 0
upon 0
to 0
ask 0
a 0
question 0
will 0
ask 0
a 0
single 0
question 0
and 0
then 0
will 0
yield 0
the 0
floor 0
to 0
other 0
journalists; 0
(2) 0
At 0
the 0
discretion 0
of 0
the 0
President 0
or 0
other 0
White 0
House 0
official 0
taking 0
questions, 0
a 0
follow-up 0
question 0
or 0
questions 0
may 0
be 0
permitted; 0
and 0
where 0
a 0
follow 0
up 0
has 0
been 0
allowed 0
and 0
asked, 0
the 0
questioner 0
will 0
then 0
yield 0
the 0
floor; 0
(3) 0
“Yielding 0
the 0
floor” 0
includes, 0
when 0
applicable, 0
physically 0
surrendering 0
the 0
microphone 0
to 0
White 0
House 0
staff 0
for 0
use 0
by 0
the 0
next 0
questioner; 0
(4) 0
Failure 0
to 0
abide 0
by 0
any 0
of 0
rules 0
(1)-(3) 0
may 0
result 0
in 0
suspension 0
or 0
revocation 0
of 0
the 0
journalist’s 0
hard 0
pass. 0

I 1
can 1
see 1
this 1
going 1
way 1
downhill. 1

If 0
you 0
want 0
to 0
deal 0
with 0
people 0
like 0
Acosta, 0
at 0
the 0
moment 0
they 0
begin 0
to 0

For 0
decades, 0
Americans 0
have 0
known 0
that 0
very 1
sick 1
things 1
happen 0
behind 0
the 0
scenes 0
in 0
Washington 0
D.C., 0
but 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
nearly 0
really 0
talks 0
about 0
any 0
of 0
it. 0

But 0
now 0
the 0
curtain 0
is 0
starting 0
to 0
be 0
pulled 0
back, 0
and 0
the 0
revelations 0
about 0
Al 0
Franken 0
are 0
just 0
the 0
beginning. 0

Earlier 0
this 0
week, 0
I 0
wrote 0
an 0
article 0
about 0
how 0
“sexual 1
harassment 1
is 1
rampant 1
in 1
the 1
halls 1
of 1
Congress”, 1
and 0
that 0
was 0
before 0
a 0
female 0
radio 0
anchor 0
named 0
LeeAnn 0
Tweeden 0
revealed 0
that 0
Al 0
Franken 0
had 0
“forcibly 0
kissed” 0
and 0
groped 0
her 0
during 0
a 0
USO 0
tour 0
in 0
2006. 0

The 0
following 0
comes 0
from 0
an 0
article 0
in 0
which 0
Tweeden 0
shared 0
her 0
story… 0

I 0
couldn’t 0
believe 0
it. 0

He 0
groped 0
me, 0
without 0
my 0
consent, 0
while 0
I 0
was 0
asleep. 0

I 1
felt 1
violated 1
all 1
over 1
again. 1

Embarrassed. 1

Belittled. 1

Humiliated. 1

How 0
dare 0
anyone 0
grab 0
my 0
breasts 0
like 0
this 0
and 0
think 0
it’s 0
funny? 0

I 0
told 0
my 0
husband 0
everything 0
that 0
happened 0
and 0
showed 0
him 0
the 0
picture. 0

I 0
wanted 0
to 0
shout 1
my 1
story 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
with 1
a 1
megaphone 1
to 0
anyone 0
who 0
would 0
listen, 0
but 0
even 0
as 0
angry 0
as 0
I 0
was, 0
I 0
was 0
worried 0
about 0
the 0
potential 0
backlash 0
and 0
damage 0
going 0
public 0
might 0
have 0
on 0
my 0
career 0
as 0
a 0
broadcaster. 0

But 0
that 0
was 0
then, 0
this 0
is 0
now. 0

I’m 1
no 1
longer 1
afraid. 1

When 0
the 0
story 0
initially 0
broke, 0
Franken 0
rushed 0
to 0
issue 0
an 0
apology… 0

“I 0
certainly 0
don’t 0
remember 0
the 0
rehearsal 0
for 0
the 0
skit 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
way, 0
but 0
I 0
send 0
my 0
sincerest 0
apologies 0
to 0
Leeann,” 0
said 0
Franken. 0

“As 0
to 0
the 0
photo, 0
it 0
was 0
clearly 0
intended 0
to 0
be 0
funny 0
but 0
wasn’t. 0

I 0
shouldn’t 0
have 0
done 0
it.” 0

Needless 0
to 0
say, 0
many 0
were 0
completely 1
unsatisfied 1
with 0
Franken’s 0
very 1
weak 1
statement. 1

In 0
fact, 0
some 0
members 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
party 0
said 0
that 0
his 0
apology 0
was 0
entirely 1
insufficient 1
and 0
are 0
calling 0
for 0
Franken 0
to 0
be 0
held 0
accountable 0
for 0
his 0
actions… 0

Guy 0
Cecil, 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Senatorial 0
Campaign 0
Committee 0
and 0
now 0
the 0
boss 0
of 0
a 0
leading 0
Democratic 0
super 0
PAC, 0
voiced 0
his 0
frustration 0
with 0
the 0
inadequacy 0
of 0
Franken’s 0
apology 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“That 0
was 0
not 0
an 0
apology 0
and 0
was 0
an 0
insufficient 0
response 0
to 0
serious 0
allegations,” 0
Cecil 0
tweeted. 0

“Al 1
Franken 1
must 1
be 1
held 1
accountable 1
if 1
our 1
party 1
wants 1
to 1
live 1
up 1
to 1
our 1
commitment 1
to 1
women 1
& 1
girls.” 1

This 0
scandal 0
has 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
feeding 1
frenzy 1
as 0
Internet 0
sleuths 0
search 0
for 0
other 0
incidents 0
in 0
which 0
Franken 0
has 0
acted 0
inappropriately. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
since 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
Al 0
Franken, 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
exactly 0
difficult 0
to 0
find 0
material. 0

For 0
example, 0
a 0
photo 0
has 0
surfaced 0
of 0
Franken 0
grabbing 0
Joy 0
Behar 0
in 0
a 0
very 1
creepy 1
manner. 1

The 0
following 0
comes 0
from 0
Breitbart… 0

Amid 0
the 0
emergence 0
of 0
a 0
2006 0
photo 0
of 0
Al 0
Franken 0
groping 0
journalist 0
and 0
talk 0
radio 0
anchor 0
Leeann 0
Tweeden, 0
a 0
photo 0
of 0
the 0
embattled 0
Minnesota 0
Senator 0
appearing 0
to 0
grab 0
comedian 0
Joy 0
Behar’s 0
breast 0
has 0
also 0
resurfaced. 0

Franken 0
was 0
a 0
comedian 0
before 0
he 0
ever 0
entered 0
the 0
world 0
of 0
politics, 0
and 0
we 0
understand 0
that. 0

But 0
just 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
comedian 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
that 0
he 0
gets 0
to 0
play 0
by 0
a 0
different 0
set 0
of 0
rules. 0

There 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
ongoing 0
pattern 0
of 0
behavior, 0
and 0
Fox 0
News 0
has 0
documented 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
other 0
incidents 0
that 0
have 0
come 0
up 0
in 0
the 0
past… 0

Franken, 0
then 0
a 0
comedian, 0
was 0
quoted 0
in 0
a 0
1995 0
New 0
York 0
Magazine 0
article 0
discussing 0
a 0
skit 0
for 0
“Saturday 0
Night 0
Live” 0
that 0
involved 0
drugging 1
and 1
raping 1
CBS 1
reporter 1
Lesley 1
Stahl. 1

Franken, 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
a 0
writer 0
for 0
“SNL,” 0
suggested 0
one 0
skit 0
should 0
play 0
out 0
with 0
“60 0
Minutes” 0
commentator 0
Andy 0
Rooney 0
finding 0
an 0
empty 0
pill 0
bottle 0
on 0
his 0
desk. 0

“’I 0
give 0
the 0
pills 0
to 0
Lesley 0
Stahl. 0

Then 0
when 0
Lesley 0
is 0
passed 0
out, 0
I 1
take 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
rape 1
her.’ 1
Or 0
‘That’s 0
why 0
you 0
never 0
see 0
Lesley 0
until 0
February.’ 0
Or, 0
‘When 0
she 0
passes 0
out. 0

I 0
put 0
her 0
in 0
various 0
positions 0
and 0
take 0
pictures 0
of 0
her,’” 0
Franken 0
was 0
quoted 0
saying. 0

The 0
article, 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
2000 0
Playboy 0
column 0
in 0
which 0
Franken 0
talked 0
about 0
fantasizing 1
a 1
machine 1
would 1
perform 1
oral 1
sex 1
on 1
him, 1
was 0
used 0
to 0
attack 0
Franken 0
during 0
his 0
2008 0
Senate 0
campaign 0
in 0
Minnesota. 0

As 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
may 1
be 1
appalled 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
Al 1
Franken 1
has 1
done, 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
far 1
worse 1
offenders 1
in 1
Washington. 1

Let’s 0
talk 0
about 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
for 0
a 0
moment. 0

Democrats 0
have 0
been 0
covering 0
up 0
his 0
sexual 0
crimes 0
for 0
years, 0
and 0
my 0
hope 0
is 0
that 0
now 0
this 0
will 0
start 0
to 0
change. 0

if 1
even 1
half 1
of 1
their 1
allegations 1
are 1
true 1
Clinton 1
should 1
be 1
in 1
prison 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life. 1

In 0
my 0
article 0
yesterday, 0
I 0
discussed 0
how 0
one 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
is 0
charging 0
former 0
Vice-President 0
Joe 0
Biden 0
of 0
engaging 0
in 0
“Weinstein-level” 1
behavior, 1
and 0
I 0
also 0
talked 0
about 0
how 0
15 0
million 0
dollars 0
in 0
settlements 0
have 0
been 0
secretly 0
paid 0
out 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

There 1
is 1
a 1
culture 1
of 1
corruption 1
in 1
Washington 1
D.C., 1
and 1
we 1
desperately 1
need 1
to 1
drain 1
the 1
swamp. 1

If 1
you 1
agree, 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
support 1
my 1
campaign 1
and 1
the 1
campaigns 1
of 1
other 1
anti-establishment 1
candidates 1
that 1
want 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
the 1
halls 1
of 1
Congress. 1

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
take 0
our 0
government 0
back 0
because 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
it 0
has 0
become 0
an 0
absolutely 1
disgusting 1
cesspool 1
of 1
filth 1
and 1
corruption. 1

If 0
the 0

This 0

On 0

Donald 0

was 0
flying 0
to 0
a 0
military 0
tank 0
plant 0
in 0
Lima, 0
Ohio, 0
to 0
deliver 0
a 0
speech 0
on 0
the 0

but, 0
as 0
is 0
frequently 0
the 0
case, 0
the 0
president 0
had 0
something 0
more 0
pressing 0
on 0
his 0
mind. 0

While 0
aboard 0
Air 0
Force 0

the 0
president 0
killed 0
some 0
time 0
by 0
picking 0
up 0

and 0
ringing 0
associates 0
to 0
ask 0
them 0
if 0
they 0
thought 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller’s 0
report 0
would 0
be 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
this 0
week, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
source 0
with 0
knowledge 0
of 0
these 0
conversations. 0

The 0
report, 0
which 0
would 0
mark 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team’s 0
investigation 0
into 0
alleged 0
Russian 0
interference 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
election 0
and 0
potential 0
obstruction 0
of 0
justice, 0
has 0
for 0
many 0
months 0
kicked 0
off 0
round 0
after 0
round 0
of 0
speculation 0
among 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
political 0
class 0
about 0
when, 0
exactly, 0
it 0
will 0
finally 0
be 0
delivered 0
to 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

This 0
week, 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
himself 0
joined 0
in 0
on 0
the 0
anxious 0
anticipation 0
and 0
the 1
Mueller 1
report 1
guessing 1
game. 1

According 0
to 0
three 0
knowledgeable 0
sources, 0
Trump 0
has 0
quizzed 0
various 0
people—administration 0
officials, 0
friends, 0
his 0
legal 0
team—throughout 0
the 0
week 0
if 0
they 0
believed 0
the 0
buzz 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
could 0
be 0
delivered 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
week. 0

The 0
president, 0
these 0
sources 0
said, 0
speculated 0
on 0
when 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
finally 0
happen, 0
repeatedly 0
citing 0
news 0
reports 0
from 0
this 0
week 0
on 0
a 0
possible 0
imminent 0
delivery. 0

Reached 0
for 0
comment, 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders 0
replied 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
“nothing 1
to 1
add 1
right 1
now,” 1
as 0
of 0
Friday 0
afternoon. 0

“I 0
told 0
the 0
president 0
this 0
morning 0
[to] 0
go 0
about 0
your 0
schedule, 0
we’re 0
prepared 0
for 0
anything,” 0
Rudy 0
Giuliani, 0
one 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
personal 0
attorneys, 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Beast 0
on 0
Friday, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
president 0
in 0
person 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

Giuliani 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
the 0
president 0
have 0
been 0
hearing 0
the 0
report 0
delivery 0
could 0
happen 0
“today,” 0
but 0
clarified 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
client 0
are 0
going 0
off 0
of 0
media, 0
not 0
any 0
“insider 0
information.” 0

Trump’s 0
reelection 0
campaign 0
also 0
got 0
in 0
on 0
this 0
week’s 0
speculation 0
game, 1
texting 0
supporters 0
early 0
Friday 0
afternoon, 0
“President 0
Trump 0
has 0
put 0
up 0
with 0
the 1
WITCH 1
HUNT 1
for 0
2 0
YEARS. 0

Do 0
you 0
think 0
it's 0
time 0
for 0
it 0
to 0
end? 0

Take 0
our 0
OFFICIAL 0
poll 0
NOW.” 0

The 0
president, 0
who 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
is 0
“illegal” 0
and 0
a 1
“WITCH 1
HUNT” 1
driven 0
by 0
angry 1
liberals, 1
made 0
clear 0
to 0
reporters 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
earlier 0
this 0
week 0
that 0
the 0
coming 0
report 0
was, 0
of 0
course, 0
weighing 0
on 0
him. 0

“Let 1
it 1
come 1
out, 1
let 1
people 1
see 1
it,” 1
Trump 0
said, 0
characterizing 0
the 0
probe 0
and 0
report 0
as 0
“ridiculous,” 1
as 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“Let’s 0
see 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
it’s 0
legit.” 0

But 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
he 0
hasn’t 0
always 0
been 0
so 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
report 0
seeing 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
day, 0
or 0
even 0
having 0
the 0
investigation 0
conclude. 0

As 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reported 0
early 0
last 0
year, 0
Trump 0
ordered 0
the 0
firing 0
of 0
the 0
special 0
counsel, 0
but 0
reversed 0
course 0
after 0
the 0
then-White 0
House 0
Counsel 0
Don 0
McGahn 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
resign 1
instead 1
of 1
executing 1
Trump’s 1
order. 1

Still, 0
even 0
after 0
the 0
Mueller 0
probe 0
officially 0
wraps, 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
the 0
beginning, 0
not 0
a 0
dramatic 0
end, 0
to 0
Trumpworld’s 1
wide-ranging 1
legal 1
woes. 1

On 0
Friday, 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reported 0
that 0
Democratic 0
chairs 0
of 0
six 0
different 0
House 0
committees 0
investigating 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
allies 0
are 0
planning 0
on 0
asking 0
the 0
FBI, 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice, 0
and 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
preserve 0
records 0
provided 0
to 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
investigators. 0

President 0
Trump 0
himself 0
appears 0
to 0
realize 0
that 0
the 1
end 1
is 1
nowhere 1
near. 1

As 0
The 0
Daily 0
Beast 0
reported 0
last 0
month, 0
the 0
president 0
made 0
clear 0
to 0
his 0
outside 0
legal 0
team, 0
which 0
includes 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Jay 0
Sekulow, 0
that 0
he 0
wanted 0
his 0
attorneys 0
sitting 0
tight, 0
even 0
after 0
the 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
is 0
history. 0

Trump 0
broached 0
the 0
topic 0
in 0
multiple 0
conversations 0
beginning 0
late 0
last 0
year, 0
while 0
discussing 0
the 0
other 0
inquiries 0
threatening 0
his 0
presidency 0
and 0
inner 0
circle, 0
chief 0
among 0
them 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York. 0

But 0
if 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
is 0
actually, 0
finally 0
sent 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
by 0
close 0
of 0
business 0
on 0
Friday, 0
the 0
president 0
will 0
be 0
many 0
miles 0
away 0
from 0
it. 0

On 0
Friday 0
morning, 0
Trump 0
flew 0
to 0
Palm 0
Beach, 0
Florida, 0
where 0
he 0
and 0
first 0
lady 0
Melania 0
Trump 0
were 0
scheduled 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
Caribbean 0
leaders 0
at 0
Mar-a-Lago, 0
the 0
president’s 0
private 0
club 0
and 0
getaway. 0

Who 0
‘Won’ 0
the 0
Trump-Kim 0
Summit? 0

Last 0
week’s 0
Economist 0
Magazine 0
won 0
the 0
day 0
with 0
the 0
best-ever 1
headline 0
about 0
the 0
Trump-Kim 0
Jong-un 0
summit: 0
`Kim 0
Jong 0
Won!’ 0

That 0
said 0
it 0
all. 0

Just 0
out 0
of 0
hospital, 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
no 0
shape 0
to 0
compete 0
with 0
the 0
great 0
Economist 0
or 0
its 0
very 0
witty 0
headline 0
writers. 0

But 0
after 0
watching 0
a 0
week 0
of 0
post 0
Singapore 0
summit 0
between 0
Great 1
White 1
Father 1
Trump 0
and 0
delinquent 1
Kim 0
Jong-un 0
I 0
must 0
totally 0
agree 0
with 0
the 0
Economist. 0

What 0
was 0
billed 0
as 0
a 0
second-coming 0
extravaganza 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
leaders 0
– 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
trading 0
insults 0
of 0
‘little 1
rocket 1
man’ 1
and 0
‘dotard’ 1
(someone 0
who 0
is 0
senile) 0
turned 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
very 1
expensive 1
photo 0
op 0
for 0
both 0
publicity 0
seekers 0
that 0
made 0
much 0
noise 0
but 0
produced 0
very 0
little 0
– 0
at 0
least 0
so 0
far. 0

It 0
seemed 0
as 0
if 0
two 0
schoolyard 1
bullies 1
had 0
been 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
principal 0
to 0
shake 0
hands. 0

Beyond 0
gestures, 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
leader 0
certainly 0
came 0
out 0
ahead. 0

His 0
objective 0
– 0
and 0
those 0
of 0
his 0
family 0
predecessors 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
60 0
years 0
– 0
was 0
to 0
normalize 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
US, 0
start 0
trade, 0
and 0
end 0
US 0
efforts 0
to 0
overthrow 0
the 0
Marxist 0
government 0

Pyongyang. 0

Trump’s 0
objectives, 0
at 0
least 0
initially, 0
were 0
to 1
crush 1
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
threats 0
it 0
could 0
pose 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
its 0
regional 0
allies 0
Japan 0
and 0
South 0
Korea. 0

Trump 0
sought 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
Kim 0
as 0
a 0
bogeyman, 1
and 0
himself 0
as 0
America’s 1
savior. 1

Trump 0
knew 0
perfectly 1
well 1
that 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
destroy 0
all 0
of 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
deeply 0
buried 0
nuclear-armed 0
missiles, 0
and, 0
in 0
spite 0
of 0
his 0
huffing 0
and 0
puffing, 0
had 1
no 1
stomach 1
for 1
an 1
invasion 1
of 0
North 0
Korea 0
that 0
could 0
cost 0
the 0
US 0
an 0
estimated 0
250,000 0
casualties. 0

So 0
Trump’s 0
solution 0
was 0
more 0
show-biz. 1

A 0
much 1
ballyhooed 1
flight 0
to 0
Singapore, 0
backslapping 0
a 0
delighted 1
Kim, 0
and 0
a 0
love-fest 1
between 0
the 0
two 0
chunky 1
leaders 0
was 1
sold 1
to 1
Americans 0
as 0
the 0
dawn 0
of 0
peace. 0

America’s 0
media 0
was 0
quick 0
to 0
retail 0
the 0
story 0
and 0
burnish 1
Trump’s 0
credentials 0
among 0
the 0
seriously 0
credulous. 0

No 0
more 0
hiding 0
under 0
your 0
school 0
desks 0
or 0
in 0
dank 0
basements. 0

As 0
Trump 0
grandly 1
proclaimed, 0
Americans 1
no 1
longer 1
have 1
to 1
fear 1
North 1
Korea 1
and 0
can 1
sleep 1
peacefully 1
at 1
night! 1

Why? 1

Korea 0
still 0
has 0
all 0
of 0
its 0
medium 0
and 0
long-ranged 0
missiles 0
and 0
an 0
estimated 0
40 0
or 0
more 0
nuclear 0
warheads. 0

The 0
North 0
is 0
developing 0
submarines 0
that 0
can 0
launch 0
nuclear-armed 0
missiles 0
from 0
underwater 0
off 0
America’s 0
coasts. 0

For 0
Kim, 0
these 0
weapons 0
are 0
purely 0
defensive, 0
designed 0
to 0
prevent 0
a 0
US 0
attack 0
on 0
his 0
nation. 0

But 0
he 0
is 0
now 0
a 0
full-fledged 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
club. 0

Equally 0
important, 0
North 0
Korea 0
still 0
has 0
an 0
estimated 0
14,000 0
170mm 0
guns 0
and 0
hundreds 0
of 0
300mm 0
long-ranged 0
rocket 0
launchers 0
emplaced 0
in 0
caves 0
just 0
north 0
of 0
the 0
Demilitarized 0
Zone 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
Koreas. 0

They 0
threaten 0
almost 0
all 0
of 0
South 0
Korea’s 0
capital 0
Seoul 0
north 0
of 0
the 0
Han 0
River 0
and 0
some 0
US 0
military 0
bases 0
and 0
key 0
airfields, 0
notably 0
Osan. 0

This 0
is 0
a 1
very 1
real 1
threat 1
– 0
one 0
that 0
is 0
largely 0
immune 0
to 0
attack 0
from 0

I 0

in 0
the 0

Kim 0

that 0

Patel 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
main 0
events 0
promoted 0
beforehand. 0

However, 0
his 0
jokes 0
quickly 0
progressed 0
to 0
uncomfortable 0
territory, 0
including 0
one 0
about 0
a 0
gay 0
black 0
man 0
who 0
lives 0
in 0
his 0
neighborhood 0
and 0
how 0
“[I]t 0

not 0

because 1
no 1

wants 1
to 1

The 0
tension 0
in 0
the 0

increased 0
as 0
Patel 0
told 0
more 0
jokes 0
in 0
this 0
vein 0
until 0
organizers 0
of 0
the 0
event 0
went 0
up 0
on 0
stage 0
to 0
stop 0
him, 0
citing 0
a 0
change 0
in 0
program 0
plans. 0

Patel 0
questioned 0
why 0
this 0
was 0
happening. 0

The 0
organizers 0
replied 0
that 0
the 0
person 0
in 0
charge 0
of 0
tech 0
had 0
to 0
leave 0
early, 0
but 0
Patel 0
continued 0

claim 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
being 0
cut 0
off 0
because 0
the 0

didn’t 0
like 0

At 0
one 0
point, 0
one 0
organizer 0
told 0

he 0
was 0
being 0

When 0
asked 0

A 0
rough 0
patch—or 0
a 0
double-dip 0
recession? 0

Economists 0
are 0
increasingly 1
befuddled 1
at 0
what 0
awaits 0
the 0
once-great 0
U.S. 0
economy. 0

And 0
Wall 0
Street 0
is 0
plainly 0
beginning 0
to 0
panic. 0

Unemployment 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
point. 0

It 0
now 0
seems 0
obvious 0
that 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
mysterious 1
memos 1
has 0
gone 0
out 0
to 0
the 0
Main 0
Stream 0
Media 0
saying 0
that 0
no-one 0
can 0
mention 0
the 0
immigration 0
moratorium 0
solution. 0

But 0
unemployment 0
is 0
befuddling 0
anyway. 0

Just 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
ago 0
professional 0
prognosticators 0
were 0
expecting 0
job 0
growth 0
of 0
175,000 0
in 0
May. 0

However, 0
nonfarm 0
payroll 0
growth 0
came 0
in 0
at 0
54,000 0
in 0
May, 0
the 0
smallest 0
gain 0
since 0
September, 0
and 0
a 0
fraction 0
of 0
the 0
just 0
lowered 0
consensus 0
forecast 0
(125,000 0
jobs.) 0

The 0
"other" 0
employment 0
survey, 0
of 0
households 0
rather 0
than 0
businesses, 0
also 0
broadcast 0
mixed 0
signals—at 0
least 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
prospects 0
for 0
native-born 0
workers 0
are 0
concerned. 0

VDARE.com 0
has 0
long 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
household 0
survey 0
captures 0
the 0
employment 0
of 0
illegal 0
aliens; 0
additionally, 0
it 0
actually 0
mentions 0
ethnicity. 0

In 0
May, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Household 0
Survey, 0
total 0
employment 0
rose 0
by 0
105,000. 0

Non-Hispanics 0
actually 0
gained 0
ground: 0

Total 0
employment: 0
up 0
105,000 0
(+0.08 0
percent) 0

Non-Hispanic 0
employment: 0
up 0
190,000 0
(+0.16 0
percent) 0

Hispanic 0
employment: 0
down 0
85,000 0
(-0.42 0
percent) 0

Thus 0
VDAWDI—VDARE.com's 0
American 0
Worker 0
Displacement 0
Index, 0
unveiled 0
in 0
2004 0
and 0
still 0
unique—fell 0
to 0
126.2 0
in 0
May 0
from 0
April's 0
127.0 0
level. 0

This, 0
of 0
course, 0
is 0
atypical 0
statistical 0
noise. 0

Non-Hispanics 0
have 0
lost 0
jobs 0
at 0
twice 0
the 0
rate 0
of 0
Hispanics 0
since 0
the 0
recession 0
hit 0
in 0
December 0
2007. 0

And 0
since 0
the 0
official 0
start 0
of 0
the 0
"recovery" 0
in 0
June 0
2009, 0
Hispanics 0
have 0
gained 0
416,000 0
jobs 0
while 0
non-Hispanics 0
have 0
lost 0
675,000 0
positions. 0

Step 0
back 0
further 0
and 0
the 1
picture 1
is 1
still 1
bleaker. 1

Since 0
January 0
2001 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
non-Hispanics 0
holding 0

court 0
when 0
its 0

1. 0

Democrats 0
had 0
Kavanaugh 0
accuser 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford’s 0
never-credible 1
accusations 1
of 1
sexual 1
abuse 1
-- 0
including 0
possible 0
attempted 0
rape 0
-- 0
in 0
hand 0
way 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
summer. 0

They 1
deliberately 1
refused 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
the 1
allegations, 1
as 1
weak 1
and 1
ridiculous 1
as 1
they 1
are, 1
at 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
Senate 1
confirmation 1
hearings 1
because 1
they 1
didn’t 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
rational 1
discussion. 1

They 0
wanted 0
to 0
hurl 1
the 1
wild 1
claims 1
like 1
a 1
grenade 1
at 0
the 0
last 0
minute 0
to 0
blow 0
up 0
the 0
process. 0

And 0
so 0
far 0
it 0
appears 0
they’re 0
succeeding. 0

If 0
Kavanaugh 0
isn’t 0
in 0
place 0
a 0
week 0
from 0
Monday, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
will 0
begin 0
hearing 0
cases 0
in 0
its 0
new 0
term 0
shorthanded. 0

The 0
high 0
court 0
normally 0
has 0
a 0

nine 0
justices 0
but 0
with 0
Associate 0
Justice 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy’s 0

there 0
have 0
only 0
been 0

Roughly 0

there 0
is 0
a 0
4-to-4 0
liberal 0
to 0
conservative 0
ideological 0
split 0
on 0

Democrats 0
would 0
prefer 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
into 0
the 0
next 0
Congress 0
where 0
they 0
hope 0

Election 0

6. 0

The 0
GOP 0
currently 0
controls 0
the 0
Senate, 0
which 0
has 0
the 0
final 0
say 0
on 0
judicial 0
nominations, 0
by 0
an 0
uncomfortably 0
close 0
margin 0
of 0
51 0
to 0
49. 0

Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford’s 0
lawyers 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
game 0
the 0
system. 0

They 0
know 0
that 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
rules 0
require 0
Chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
to 0
provide 0
a 0
full 0
week’s 0
notice 0
for 0
a 0
hearing. 0

So, 0
if, 0
for 0
example, 0
the 0
committee 0
followed 0
the 0
rules 0
and 0
agreed 0
Friday 0
(today) 0
to 0
a 0
hearing, 0
the 0
soonest 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
held 0
would 0
be 0
next 0
Friday, 0
the 0
final 0
business 0
day 0
before 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court’s 0
new 0

begins. 0

Of 0

lawyers 1
are 1
masters 1

delay, 1
and 0
social 1
justice 1
warrior-lawyers 1
hoping 1

New 0
demands 0
and 0
fake 0
emergencies 0
are 0
bound 0
to 0
arise 0
from 0
Ford’s 0
legal 0
team. 0

It 0
was 0
unclear 0
at 0
press 0
time 0
if 0
the 0
public 0
hearing 0
scheduled 0
for 0
Monday 0
into 0
the 0
allegations 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
would 0
go 0
forward. 0

Kavanaugh 0
informed 0
the 0
committee 0
he 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
testify 0
Monday. 0

“I 0
continue 0
to 0
want 0
a 0
hearing 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible, 0
so 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
clear 0
my 0
name," 0
he 0
wrote 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

Ford's 0
lawyer 0
Debra 0
Katz 0
told 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
her 0
client 0
"wishes 0
to 0
testify, 0
provided 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
agree 0
on 0
terms 0
that 0
are 0
fair 0
and 0
which 0
ensure 0
her 0
safety." 0

Another 0
Ford 0
attorney 0
reportedly 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
“multiple 0
witnesses” 0
who 0
need 0
to 0
testify. 0

"A 0
hearing 0
on 0
Monday 0
is 0
not 0
possible 0
and 0
the 0
Committee's 0
insistence 0
that 0
it 0
occur 0
then 0
is 0
arbitrary 0
in 0
any 0
event,” 0
Katz 0
wrote 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

“Dr. 0

Ford 0
has 0
asked 0
me 0
to 0
let 0
you 0
know 0
that 0
she 0
appreciates 0
the 0
various 0
options 0
you 0
have 0
suggested. 0

Her 0
strong 0
preference 0
continues 0
to 0
be 0
for 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
to 0
allow 0
for 0
a 0
full 0
investigation 0
prior 0
to 0
her 0
testimony.” 0

GOP 0
lawmakers 0
are 0
figuring 0
out 0
how 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
Ford’s 0
request, 0
the 0
San 0
Diego 0
Union-Tribune 0
reports: 0

Late 0
Thursday, 0
Sen. 0
Charles 0
E. 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa), 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
chairman, 0
said 0
that 0
his 0
staff 0
had 0
discussed 0
the 0
issue 0
with 0
Ford’s 0
attorney 0
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
day 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
consult 0
with 0
his 0
fellow 0
committee 0
members 0
about 0
the 0
next 0
move. 0

Ford’s 0
offer 0
also 0
increased 0
the 0
pressure 0
on 0
several 0
key 0
moderates 0
— 0
particularly 0
GOP 0
Sens. 0

Susan 0
Collins 0
of 0
Maine 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Murkowski 0
of 0
Alaska 0
— 0
whose 0
votes 0
will 0
probably 0
be 0
needed 0
to 0
put 0
Kavanaugh 0
on 0
the 0
high 0
court. 0

Both 0
were 0
already 0
facing 0
heavy 0
pressure 0
from 0
abortion 0
rights 0
groups 0
concerned 0
that 0
Kavanaugh, 0
a 1
staunch 1
conservative 1
and 0
longtime 0
GOP 0
attorney, 0
might 0
vote 0
to 0
restrict 0
access 0
to 0
abortion. 0

The 0
sexual 0
assault 0
allegation, 0
which 0
the 0
nominee 0
has 0
denied, 0
has 0
upended 0
his 0
seemingly 0
sure-bet 0
confirmation 0
and 0
only 0
increased 0
the 0
stakes 0
for 0
the 0
key 0
lawmakers. 0

Chairman 0
Grassley 0
had 0
imposed 0
a 0
Thursday 0
deadline 0
for 0
Ford 0
to 0
submit 0
testimony 0
after 0
her 0
team 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
she 0
wasn’t 0
willing 0
to 0
testify 0
until 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigates 0
her 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
allegations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Left-wingers 1
such 0
as 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
Senate 0
Minority 0
Leader 0
Chuck 0
Schumer 0
(D-N.Y.) 0
echoed 0
Ford’s 0
demand. 0

The 0
demand 0
for 0
an 0
FBI 0
probe 0
is 0
“utter 1
nonsense,” 1
former 0
U.S. 0
Attorney 0
Joseph 0
diGenova 0
said 0
earlier 0
this 0
week. 0

Ford 0
“really 0
doesn’t 0
want 0
to 0
testify,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Because 0
when 0
she 0
does, 0
she 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
the 1
loon 1
she 1
is. 1

She 0
may 0
very 0
well 0
believe 0
everything 0
she’s 0
saying, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
signs 0
of 0
lunacy, 0
believing 0
something 0
that 0
isn’t 0
real.” 0
And 0
her 1
lawyer 1
is 1
“even 1
loonier.” 1

Besides, 0
diGenova 0
explained, 0
the 0
eleventh-hour 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
claim 0
leveled 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
non-federal 0
matter 0
and 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
the 0
alleged 0
assault 0
hasn’t 0
even 0
been 0
clearly 0
outlined 0
by 0
the 0
alleged 0
victim. 0

Ford 0
didn’t 0
report 0
it 0
to 0
anyone 0
for 0
decades 0
and 0
isn’t 0
even 0
certain 0
when 0
or 0
where 0
it 0
happened, 0
so 0
the 0
FBI 0
can’t 0
investigate 0
the 0
matter 0
“because 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
to 0
investigate.” 0

Kavanaugh 0
has 0
already 0
undergone 0
six 0
FBI 0
background 0
checks 0
and 0
the 0
agency 0
has 0
ruled 0
out 0
investigating 0
Ford’s 0
allegation 0
of 0
drunken 0
groping 0
at 0
a 0
teenagers’ 0
party 0
36 0
years 0
ago. 0

Ford’s 1
request 1
for 1
an 1
FBI 1
probe 1
is 1
“clearly 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
delay 1
proceedings,” 1
diGenova 0
said. 0

President 0
Trump 0
is 0
taking 0
the 0
high 0
road 0
and 0
is 0
avoiding 0
attacking 0

Steps 0

Successfully 0
Counter 0

By 0
Jamie 0
Glazov 0

While 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
continues 0
to 0
allow 0
the 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
to 0
direct 0
American 0
foreign 0
policy 0
and, 0
therefore, 0
to 0
implement 0
“strategies” 0
that 0
render 0
America 0
defenseless 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Jihad 0
and 0
stealth 1
Jihad, 1
there 0
are 0
some 0
alternative 0
strategies 0
that 0
have 0
the 0
potential 0
to 0
turn 0
this 0
catastrophic 1
situation 1
around 0
completely 0
in 0
America’s 0
favor. 0

Below 1
are 1
9 1
concrete 1
steps 1
that, 1
if 1
implemented 1
by 1
a 1
future 1
American 1
administration, 1
would 1
make 1
a 1
big 1
difference 1
in 1
preserving 1
our 1
civilization 1
and 1
in 1
defending 1
Americans 1
from 1
terrorism: 1

1. 0

Label 0
the 0
Enemy 0
and 0
Make 0
a 0
Threat 0
Assessment. 0

The 1
Obama 1
administration 1
continues 1
to 1
refuse 1
to 1
label 1
our 1
enemy 1
and, 1
therefore, 1
it 1
continues 1
to 1
enable 1
our 1
defeat 1
in 1
the 1
terror 1
war. 1

It 0
is 0
urgent 0
that 0
we 0
name 0
our 1
enemy 1
(i.e. 1

Islamic 1
Jihad) 1
and 0
definitively 0
identify 0
what 0
ideology 0
inspires 0
our 1
enemy 1
(i.e. 1

Islamic 1
law). 1

2. 0

Scrap 0
“Countering 1
Violent 1
Extremism.” 1

“Countering 1
Violent 1
Extremism” 1
is 0
the 0
pathetic 1
and 1
destructive 1
focus 0
of 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
in 0
allegedly 0
fighting 0
the 0
terror 0
war. 0

On 0
the 0
one 0
hand, 0
this 0
“focus” 0
is 0
vague 0
to 0
the 0
point 0
of 0
being 0
meaningless 0
and 0
completely 1
incapacitates 1
us. 1

On 1
the 1
other 1
hand, 1
this 1
focus 1
allows 1
the 1
administration 1
to 1
perpetuate 1
the 1
destructive 1
fantasy 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
other 1
types 1
of 1
“extremists” 1
— 1
who 1
just 1
happen 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
Left’s 1
political 1
opponents 1
— 1
that 1
pose 1
a 1
great 1
threat 1
to 1
the 1
country. 1

For 0
example, 0
as 0
Stephen 0
Coughlin 0
has 0
revealed, 0
the 0
“violent 1
extremists” 1
the 0
administration 0
is 0
clearly 0
worried 0
about 0
are 0
the 0
“right-wing 1
Islamophobes” 1
whom 1
the 1
administration 1
obviously 1
considers 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
real 1
threat 1
to 1
American 1
security. 1

The 0
“Countering 1
Violent 1
Extremism” 1
is 1
trash 1
and 1
needs 1
to 1
be 1
thrown 1
in 1
the 1
garbage. 1

3. 0

Stop 0
“Partnering” 0
With 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
Front 0
Groups. 0

The 0
government 0
needs 0
to 0
stop 0
cooperating 0
with, 0
and 0
listening 0
to, 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
front 0
groups 0
such 0
as 0
CAIR 0
and 0
ISNA 0
immediately. 0

The 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
document, 0
the 0
Explanatory 0
Memorandum, 0
has 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
Brotherhood’s 0
objective 0
is 0
to 1
destroy 1
our 1
civilization 1
from 1
within 1
by 0
our 0
own 0
hands 0
with 0
the 0
influence 0
of 0
these 0
groups. 0

Moreover, 0
as 1
Robert 1
Spencer 1
advises, 1
there 1
needs 1
to 1
be 1
legislation 1
that 1
will 1
bar 1
all 1
such 1
groups 1
and 1
affiliated 1
individuals 1
from 1
advising 1
the 1
government 1
or 1
receiving 1
any 1
grants 1
from 1
it. 1

4. 0

Implement 0
a 0
Concrete 0
“Countering-Jihad” 1
Strategy. 1

After 0
discarding 0
the 0
“Countering 1
Violent 1
Extremism” 1
absurdity, 1
a 0
concrete 0
Counter-Jihad 1
strategy 1
must 0
become 0
an 0
official 0
policy. 0

It 0
must 0
specifically 0
register 0
that 0
Jihadists 1
are 0
the 0
enemies 0
and 0
that 0
Islamic 0
law 0
(Sharia) 0
is 0
what 0
specifically 0
motivates 0
them. 0

Most 0
importantly, 0
as 1
Sebastian 1
Gorka 1
urges 1
in 1
Defeating 1
Jihad: 1
The 1
Winnable 1
War, 1
the 1
government 1
needs 1
to 1
lay 1
down 1
a 1
vision, 1
an 1
actual 1
“threat 1
doctrine 1
analysis” 1
in 1
a 1
thorough 1
document, 1
just 1
like 1
George 1
Kennan’s 1
Long 1
Telegram 1
and 1
NSC-68 1
did 1
in 1
laying 1
out 1
the 1
strategic 1
foundation 1
to 1
fighting 1
communism 1
in 1
the 1
Cold 1
War. 1

It 1
is 1
absolutely 1
mind-boggling 1
that 1
nothing 1
of 1
this 1
sort 1
exists 1
today 1
in 1
our 1
terror 1
war 1
— 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
a 1
reflection 1
of 1
the 1
Left 1
being 1
in 1
charge 1
and 1
of 1
the 1
destructive 1
defeat 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
sowing. 1

5. 0

Launch 0
Our 0
Own 0
Counter-propaganda 0
Campaign. 0

The 0
Left 0
and 0
Islamists 0
engage 0
in 0
propaganda 0
24/7. 0

What 0
does 0
our 0
propaganda 0
war 0
entail? 0

Zilch. 1

Sebastian 1
Gorka 1
is 1
crucially 1
correct, 1
therefore, 1
when 1
he 1
recommends 1
a 1
national 1
counter-propaganda 1
campaign 1
that 1
involves 1
a 1
two-part 1
approach: 1
the 0
first 0
being 0
the 0
bolstering 0
of 0
efforts 0
to 0
define 0
our 0
enemy 0
(Steps 0
#1 0
and 0
#4 0
above) 0
and, 0
second, 0
the 0
strengthening 0
of 0
our 0
allies 0
and 0
partners 0
in 0
their 0
own 0
counter-propaganda 0
efforts 0
– 0
which 0
must 0
include 0
our 0
empowering 0
of 0
Muslims 0
who 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
form 0
an 1
anti-Jihadist 1
version 1
of 1
Islam. 1

Consequently, 0
educational 0
programs 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
set 0
up 0
everywhere, 0
from 0
public 0
schools 0
to 0
universities 0
to 0
workplaces, 0
in 0
businesses 0
and 0
numerous 0
other 0
institutions. 0

These 0
programs 0
must 0
crystallize 0
what 0
exactly 0
Islamic 0
Law 0
is 0
and 0
how 0
it 0
inspires 0
and 0
sanctions 0
violence 0
against 0
unbelievers. 1

This 0
has 0
to 0
also 0
involve, 0
as 0
Gorka 0
urges, 0
“a 0
nationwide 0
program 0
of 0
education 0
that 0
includes 0
the 0
armed 0
services 0
as 0
well 0
as 0
federal, 0
state, 0
and 0
local 0
police 0
forces 0
and 0
the 0
intelligence 0
community.” 0

The 0
education 0
campaign 0
must 0
also 0
focus 0
on 0
the 0
second 0
part 0
of 0
Gorka’s 0
counter-propaganda 0
campaign, 0
which 0
is 0
to 0
help 0
strengthen 0
Muslims 0
who 0
seek 0
to 0
seize 0
Islam 0
from 0
the 1
jihadists’ 1
hands. 0

6. 0

Affirm 0
Sharia’s 0
Assault 0
on 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Constitution 0
as 0
Seditious. 0

Once 0
the 0
truth 0
is 0
accepted 0
that 0
jihadis 1
are 0
inspired 0
and 0
sanctioned 0
by 0
their 0
Islamic 0
texts, 0
it 0
must 0
logically 0
become 0
required 0
that 0
mosques, 0
Islamic 0
schools 0
and 0
groups 0
have 0
to 0
immediately 0
curtail 0
any 0
teaching 0
that 0
motivates 0
sedition, 0
violence, 0
and 0
hatred 0
of 0
unbelievers 1
(i.e. 0

remember 0
how 0
CAIR 0
advised 0
Muslims 0
not 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
the 0
FBI). 0

Indeed, 0
once 0
the 0
government 0
discerns 0
and 0
labels 0
the 0
elements 0
of 0
Islamic 0
law 0
that 0
threaten 0
the 0
American 0
Constitution, 0
any 0
preaching 0
and 0
spreading 0
of 0
those 0
elements 0
in 0
America 0
must 0
be 0
labelled 0
as 0
seditious. 0

7. 0

Put 0
Pressure 0
on 0
Mosques, 0
Islamic 0
Groups 0
and 0
Schools. 0

Authorities 0
have 0
to 0
start 0
subjecting 0
mosques 0
and 0
other 0
Islamic 0
institutions 0
to 0
surveillance 0
— 0
and 0
discard 0
the 1
suicidal 1
leftist 1
notion 1
that 0
it 0
is 0
“racist” 0
and 0
Islamophobic 0
to 0
do 0
so. 0

Islamic 0
institutions 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
to 0
buffer 1
their 1
lip-service 1
against 1
terror 1
with 0
actually 0
doing 0
something 0
about 0
it. 0

As 1
Robert 1
Spencer 1
counsels, 1
this 0
has 0
to 0
involve 0
introducing 0
programs 0
that 0
teach 0
against 0
jihadists’ 1
understanding 0
of 0
Islam 0
— 0
and 0
these 0
programs 0
have 0
to 0
be 0
regularly 0
monitored 0
by 0
the 0
government. 0

(This 0
will 0
be 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
Gorka’s 0
suggested 0
counter-propaganda 0
campaign 0
discussed 0
in 0
Step 0
#5). 0

Spencer 0
rightly 0
stresses 0
that 0
the 0
paradigm 0
has 0
to 0
become 0
that 0
Muslim 0
communities 0
have 0
to 0
win 0
the 0
“trust” 0
of 0
intelligence 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
agents, 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
other 0
way 0
around, 0
which 0
is, 0
absurdly 1
and 1
tragically, 1
the 0
case 0
right 0
now. 0

8. 0

Bring 0
Counter-Jihadists 1
into 0
the 0
Government. 0

Instead 0
of 0
having 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
sympathizers 0
like 0
Mohamed 0
Elibiary 0
serving 0
on 0
the 0
U.S. 0

Homeland 0
Security 0
Advisory 0
Council 0
(he 0
“resigned” 0
in 0
Sept. 0
2014 0
under 0
mysterious 0
circumstances), 0
and 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood-linked 0
individuals 0
like 0
Huma 0
Abedin 0
serving 0
as 0
the 0
right-hand 0
woman 0
of 0
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
we 1
need 1
to 1
bring 1
in 1
people 1
who 1
actually 1
love 1
America 1
and 1
want 1
to 1
protect 1
it. 1

We 0
all 0
know 0
who 0
these 0
noble 1
and 1
courageous 1
individuals 1
are 0
– 0
and 0
some 0
of 0
them 0
are 0
referenced 0
in 0
this 0
article. 0

The 0
government 0
must 0
also 0
bring 0
in 0
brave 1
Muslim 1
individuals 1
who 1
genuinely 1
reject 1
Jihad 1
and 0
empower 0
them 0
in 0
propagating 0
their 0
anti-jihadist 1
vision 1
for 0
Islam. 0

(P.S. 0

Yes, 0
there 0
is 0
an 0
argument 0
to 0
be 0
made 0
that 0
Islam 1
cannot 1
be 1
Islam 1
without 1
Jihad. 1

But 0
the 0
debate 0
over 0
this 0
belongs 0
in 0
another 0
forum. 0

And 0
whatever 0
the 0
answer, 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
that 0
the 0
effort 0
to 0
empower 0
Muslims 0
who 0
want 0
to 0
make 0
the 0
anti-jihadist 0
Islamic 0
vision 0
possible 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
made.) 0

The 1
Senate's 1
own 1
rules 1
prohibit 1
this 1
kind 1
of 1
behavior, 1
but 1
will 1
the 1
Senate 1
hold 1
these 1
women 1
to 1
the 1
standard 1
they've 1
set? 1

“This 1
is 1
a 1
clear 1
violation 1
of 1
the 1
Senate 1
Ethics 1
rules 1
which 1
safeguard 1
against 1
the 1
appearance 1
or 1
actuality 1
of 1
elected 1

‘cashing 1

Of 0
course, 0

like 0
most 0
of 0
these 0
kinds 0
of 0
violations, 0
the 0
only 0
thing 0
that 0
might 0
actually 0
occur 0
here 0
is 0
censure, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
highly 0
unlikely 0
in 0
the 0
current 0
climate. 0

However, 0
voters 0

be 0
aware 0
