the 0 299 14
window 0 299 14

third-story 0 299 14
apartment. 0 299 14

They're 1 299 15
all 1 299 15
crazy 1 299 15
in 1 299 15
Europe. 1 299 15

A 0 299 16
Muslim 0 299 16
terrorist 0 299 16
stabbed 0 299 16
four 0 299 16
people 0 299 16
at 0 299 16
a 0 299 16
train 0 299 16
station 0 299 16
near 0 299 16
Munich 0 299 16
while 0 299 16
screaming, 0 299 16
“Allahu 1 299 16
Akbar”. 1 299 16

In 0 299 17
between 0 299 17
proclaiming 0 299 17
the 0 299 17
glory 0 299 17
of 0 299 17
Allah, 0 299 17
he 0 299 17
also 0 299 17
shouted 0 299 17
that 0 299 17
his 0 299 17
victims 0 299 17
were 0 299 17
all 0 299 17
“unbelievers”. 1 299 17

A 0 299 18
woman 0 299 18
heard 0 299 18
him 0 299 18
say, 0 299 18
“Infidel, 1 299 18
you 1 299 18
must 1 299 18
die”. 1 299 18

The 0 299 19
German 0 299 19
authorities 0 299 19
came 0 299 19
to 0 299 19
the 0 299 19
inescapable 0 299 19
conclusion 0 299 19
that 0 299 19
the 0 299 19
attack 0 299 19
had 0 299 19
nothing 0 299 19
to 0 299 19
do 0 299 19
with 0 299 19
Islam. 0 299 19

Instead 0 299 20
the 0 299 20
Muslim 0 299 20
terrorist 0 299 20
had 0 299 20
been 0 299 20
“mentally 1 299 20
ill” 1 299 20
and 0 299 20
was 0 299 20
probably 0 299 20
not 0 299 20
even 0 299 20
fit 0 299 20
to 0 299 20
stand 0 299 20
trial. 0 299 20

And 0 299 21
in 0 299 21
Russia. 0 299 21

Gyulchekhra 0 299 22
Bobokulova 0 299 22
beheaded 1 299 22
a 0 299 22
4-year-old 0 299 22
girl 0 299 22
and 0 299 22
displayed 0 299 22
her 0 299 22
head 0 299 22
in 0 299 22
the 0 299 22
street 0 299 22
while 0 299 22
shouting, 0 299 22
“Allahu 1 299 22
Akbar. 1 299 22

I 0 299 23
hate 0 299 23
democracy. 0 299 23

I 0 299 24
am 0 299 24
a 0 299 24
terrorist. 0 299 24

I 0 299 25
want 0 299 25
you 0 299 25
dead.” 0 299 25
Faced 0 299 25
with 0 299 25
these 0 299 25
bafflingly 0 299 25
inscrutable 0 299 25
statements, 0 299 25
the 0 299 25
authorities 0 299 25
blamed 0 299 25
mental 1 299 25
illness. 1 299 25

And 0 299 26
Amsterdam. 0 299 26

In 0 299 27
May, 0 299 27
Malek, 0 299 27
a 0 299 27
Syrian 0 299 27
refugee, 0 299 27
stabbed 0 299 27
three 0 299 27
people 0 299 27
in 0 299 27
The 0 299 27
Hague 0 299 27
while 0 299 27
shouting, 0 299 27
“Allahu 1 299 27
Akbar.” 1 299 27
The 0 299 27
Syrian 0 299 27
had 0 299 27
previously 0 299 27
thanked 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
Dutch 0 299 27
people 0 299 27
for 0 299 27
their 0 299 27
hospitality 0 299 27
by 0 299 27
shouting, 0 299 27
“Allahu 1 299 27
Akbar,” 1 299 27
and 0 299 27
throwing 0 299 27
pieces 0 299 27
of 0 299 27
furniture 0 299 27
out 0 299 27
of 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
window 0 299 27
of 0 299 27
his 0 299 27
apartment 0 299 27
and 0 299 27
into 0 299 27
the 0 299 27
street. 0 299 27

On 0 299 28
the 0 299 28
loose, 0 299 28
Malek 0 299 28
cut 0 299 28
a 0 299 28
man’s 0 299 28
throat. 0 299 28

He 0 299 29
also 0 299 29
stabbed 0 299 29
two 0 299 29
others. 0 299 29

Police 0 299 30
shot 0 299 30
him 0 299 30
in 0 299 30
the 0 299 30
leg, 0 299 30
ruled 0 299 30
out 0 299 30
terrorism 0 299 30
and 0 299 30
blamed 0 299 30
mental 1 299 30
illness. 1 299 30

In 0 299 31
December 0 299 31
of 0 299 31
last 0 299 31
year, 0 299 31
Saleh 0 299 31
Ali, 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
Syrian 0 299 31
refugee 0 299 31
wearing 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
keffiyah 0 299 31
and 0 299 31
waving 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
terrorist 0 299 31
PLO 0 299 31
flag, 0 299 31
went 0 299 31
up 0 299 31
to 0 299 31
a 0 299 31
Jewish 0 299 31
restaurant 0 299 31
in 0 299 31
Amsterdam, 0 299 31
shouted 0 299 31
“Allahu 1 299 31
Akbar” 1 299 31
and 0 299 31
began 0 299 31
smashing 0 299 31
the 0 299 31
windows. 0 299 31

The 0 299 32
police 0 299 32
stood 0 299 32
by 0 299 32
and 0 299 32
watched 0 299 32
until 0 299 32
he 0 299 32
was 0 299 32
done. 0 299 32

And 0 299 33
then 0 299 33
they 0 299 33
arrested 0 299 33
him. 0 299 33

Ali 0 299 34
admitted 0 299 34
to 0 299 34
having 0 299 34
fought 0 299 34
with 0 299 34
Jihadists 0 299 34
in 0 299 34
Syria. 0 299 34

So 0 299 35
the 0 299 35
system 0 299 35
decided 0 299 35
that 0 299 35
he 0 299 35
needed 0 299 35
a 0 299 35
psychiatric 0 299 35
evaluation 0 299 35

Maybe 0 299 36
it's 0 299 36
not 0 299 36
the 0 299 36
terrorists 0 299 36
who 0 299 36
are 0 299 36
nuts. 1 299 36

Maybe 1 299 36

it's 1 299 36

the 1 299 36

authorities 1 299 36

who 1 299 36

are 1 299 36

insane. 1 299 36
