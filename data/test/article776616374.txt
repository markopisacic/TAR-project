echoed 0 78 18
this 0 78 18
claim. 0 78 18

The 0 78 19
outcome 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
these 0 78 19
two 0 78 19
incidents 0 78 19
was 0 78 19
the 0 78 19
passage 0 78 19
by 0 78 19
Congress 0 78 19
of 0 78 19
the 0 78 19
Gulf 0 78 19

country 0 78 19
whose 0 78 19
government 0 78 19
was 0 78 19
considered 0 78 19
to 0 78 19
be 0 78 19
jeopardized 0 78 19
by 0 78 19
“communist 0 78 19
aggression.” 0 78 19
The 0 78 19
resolution 0 78 19
served 0 78 19
as 0 78 19
Johnson’s 0 78 19
legal 0 78 19

for 0 78 19

As 0 78 20
a 0 78 20
result, 0 78 20
58,177 0 78 20
Americans 1 78 20
would 0 78 20
lose 0 78 20
their 0 78 20
lives. 0 78 20

Additionally, 0 78 21
over 0 78 21
one 0 78 21

and 0 78 21
South 0 78 21
Vietnamese, 0 78 21
including 0 78 21
627,000 0 78 21
civilians 0 78 21
would 0 78 21
be 0 78 21
slaughtered. 1 78 21

But 0 78 22
it 0 78 22
wasn’t 0 78 22
true. 0 78 22

At 1 78 23
all. 1 78 23

turned 0 78 24
out 0 78 24

in 0 78 24
the 0 78 24
eyes 0 78 24
of 0 78 24
the 0 78 24
world. 0 78 24

The 0 78 25
truth 0 78 25
of 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
matter 0 78 25
was 0 78 25
that 0 78 25
the 0 78 25
Maddox 0 78 25

When 0 78 26
the 0 78 26

announced 0 78 26
that 0 78 26
it 0 78 26

the 0 78 26
victim 0 78 26
of 0 78 26
an 0 78 26
unprovoked 0 78 26

was 0 78 26
a 0 78 26
lie. 0 78 26

In 0 78 28
1995, 0 78 28

met 0 78 28
with 0 78 28

“Absolutely 0 78 29
nothing”, 0 78 29
Giáp 0 78 29
replied. 0 78 29

Giáp 0 78 30
claimed 0 78 30
that 0 78 30
the 0 78 30

had 0 78 30
been 0 78 30
imaginary. 0 78 30

2010, 0 78 31

1,100 0 78 31

had 0 78 34
been 0 78 34
performed, 0 78 34

arguable 0 78 34
whether 0 78 34
support 0 78 34
for 0 78 34
the 0 78 34

“I 0 78 36
think 0 78 36
the 0 78 36
president 0 78 36
needs 0 78 36
to 0 78 36
watch 0 78 36
carefully 0 78 36
for 0 78 36
the 0 78 36
potential 0 78 36
for 0 78 36
