that 0 320 43
Florida 0 320 43

provided 0 320 44
staffers 0 320 44
with 0 320 44
copies 0 320 44
of 0 320 44
a 0 320 44
form, 0 320 44
known 0 320 44
as 0 320 44
a 0 320 44
“cure 0 320 44
affidavit,” 0 320 44
that 0 320 44

We 0 320 45
also 0 320 45
know 0 320 45
that 0 320 45
a 0 320 45
Broward 0 320 45
County 0 320 45
employee, 0 320 45
Chelsey 0 320 45
Smith, 0 320 45
signed 0 320 45
an 0 320 45
affidavit 0 320 45
affirming 0 320 45
that 0 320 45
she 0 320 45
had 0 320 45
seen 0 320 45
members 0 320 45
of 0 320 45
Snipes' 0 320 45
staff 0 320 45
engaging 0 320 45
in 0 320 45
voter 0 320 45
fraud. 0 320 45

She 1 320 46
ignored 1 320 46
a 1 320 46
court 1 320 46
order, 1 320 46
mixed 1 320 46
invalid 1 320 46
provisional 1 320 46
ballots 1 320 46
in 1 320 46
with 1 320 46
valid 1 320 46
ones, 1 320 46
and 1 320 46
destroyed 1 320 46
ballots, 1 320 46
but 1 320 46
don't 1 320 46
worry, 1 320 46
a 1 320 46
Democrat 1 320 46
attorney 1 320 46
says 1 320 46
that 1 320 46
doing 1 320 46
so 1 320 46
has 1 320 46
nothing 1 320 46
to 1 320 46
do 1 320 46
with 1 320 46
fraud 1 320 46

corruption. 1 320 46

Now 1 320 47
that 1 320 47
federal 1 320 47
prosecutors 1 320 47
have 1 320 47
gotten 1 320 47
involved, 1 320 47
perhaps 1 320 47
it's 1 320 47
time 1 320 47
to 1 320 47
quit 1 320 47
talking 1 320 47
about 1 320 47
it 1 320 47
and 1 320 47
actually 1 320 47
arrest 1 320 47
this 1 320 47
woman 1 320 47
and 1 320 47
charge 1 320 47
her 1 320 47
with 1 320 47
