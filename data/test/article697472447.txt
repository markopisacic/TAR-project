The 0
infamous 0
security 0
guard 0
at 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Hotel, 0
who 0
was 0
allegedly 0
shot 0
stopping 0
the 0
massacre 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
over 0
a 0
week 0
ago 0
is 0
not 0
listed 0
or 0
registered 0
as 0
such. 0

Jesus 0
Campos, 0
who 0
the 0
narrative 0
is 0
constantly 0
changing 0
around, 0
is 0
still 0
a 0
source 0
of 0
mystery. 0

So 0
who 0
is 0
Jesus 0
Campos? 0

That 0
burning 0
question 0
has 0
bothered 0
many 0
since 0
the 0
release 0
of 0
his 0
name, 0
but 0
there’s 0
been 0
no 0
photograph 0
of 0
this 0
alleged 0
hero, 0
even 0
though 0
we’ve 0
already 0
seen 0
crime 0
scene 0
images 0
of 0
the 0
guns 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
allegedly 0
dragged 0
up 0
to 0
his 0
32nd-floor 0
hotel 0
room. 0

The 0
ever-changing 0
narrative 0
now 0
though, 0
seems 0
to 0
swirl 0
around 0
this 0
unknown 0
mystery 0
security 0
guard. 0

At 0
first, 0
Campos, 0
a 0
guard 0
at 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Bay 0
Resort 0
and 0
Casino, 0
was 0
hailed 0
a 0
hero 0
for 0
helping 0
guide 0
police 0
to 0
gunman 0
Stephen 0
Paddock’s 0
room 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor. 0

Police 0
said 0
Campos 0
was 0
shot 0
in 0
the 0
leg 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
Paddock’s 0
assault 0
on 0
concertgoers—potentially 0
distracting 0
the 0
gunman 0
and 0
causing 0
him 0
to 0
panic 0
and 0
kill 0
himself. 0

But 0
now, 0
questions 0
have 0
been 0
raised 0
after 0
Clark 0
County 0
Sheriff 0
Joe 0
Lombardo 0
revised 0
the 0
timeline 0
and 0
said 0
Campos 0
had 0
actually 0
been 0
shot 0
about 0
9:59 0
p.m. 0
a 0
(full 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
began 0
at 0
10:05 0
p.m.) 0
which 0
means 0
the 0
guard 0
could 0
have 0
instead 0
led 0
Paddock 0
to 0
start 0
opening 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
crowd 0
for 0
fear 0
of 0
being 0
caught. 0

Police 0
have 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
difficult 0
to 0
identify 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
the 0
bullets 0
during 0
the 0
attack, 0
and 0
the 0
confusion 0
added 0
more 0
minutes 0
to 0
their 0
lengthy 0
response. 0

But 0
the 0
revised 0
timeline 0
shows 0
officers 0
would 0
have 0
known 0
where 0
Paddock 0
was 0
before 0
the 0
mass 0
shooting 0
even 0
started. 0

Did 0
Campos 0
call 0
911? 0

What 0
happened 0
during 0
those 0
six 0
minutes? 0

Much 0
of 0
Campos’s 0
story 0
and 0
background 0
remains 0
a 0
mystery. 0

–Newsweek 0

Campos’s 0
co-worker 0
Liliana 0
Rodriguez 0
started 0
a 0
GoFundMe 0
account 0
for 0
him 0
on 0
October 0
3, 0
explaining 0
that 0
he’d 0
been 0
shot 0
while 0
on 0
“random 0
patrol” 0
and 0
it 0
could 0
have 0
been 0
anyone 0
of 0
us. 0

“Funds 0
will 0
be 0
used 0
to 0
provide 0
relief 0
and 0
financial 0
support 0
for 0
him 0
while 0
he 0
gets 0
back 0
on 0
his 0
feet,” 0
Rodriguez’s 0
online 0
petition 0
says. 0

“This 0
is 0
a 0
young 0
man 0
that 0
I 0
work 0
with 0
day 0
in 0
and 0
day 0
out. 0

Any 0
financial 0
support 0
would 0
be 0
appreciated 0
for 0
the 0
time 0
he 0
would 0
need 0
to 0
recover.” 0

Strangely, 0
a 0
picture 0
of 0
Campos 0
wasn’t 0
displayed 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
fund 0
because 0
Rodriguez 0
indicated 0
that 0
“due 0
to 0
privacy 0
from 0
the 0
media 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
feel 0
comfortable 0
publishing 0
a 0
photo.” 0

There 1
are 1
obviously 1
certain 1
things 1
that 1
the 1
FBI 1
and 1
other 1
investigators 1
seem 1
intent 1
on 1
covering 1
up. 1

Their 0
own 0
narrative 0
is 0
quickly 0
shattering. 0

Las 0
Vegas 0
Metro 0
Police 0
Undersheriff 0
Kevin 0
McMahill 0
explained 0
more 0
about 0
Campos’s 0
actions 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting, 0
helping 0
fill 0
in 0
some 0
of 0
what 0
happened 0
ahead 0
of 0
the 0
attack, 0
but 0
unfortunately, 0
it 0
only 0
added 0
more 0
questions 0
and 0
gave 0
little 0
in 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
answers. 0

McMahill 0
told 0
KNPR, 0
a 0
local 0
NPR 0
affiliate, 0
that 0
Campos 0
went 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor 0
to 0
investigate 0
a 0
door 0
alarm. 0

While 0
on 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor, 0
he 0
found 0
that 0
a 0
stairwell 0
door 0
was 0
jammed 0
and 0
radioed 0
down 0
to 0
maintenance. 0

Campos 0
heard 0
a 0
drilling 0
sound 0
and 0
thought 0
it 0
was 0
odd. 0

A 0
maintenance 0
worker 0
came 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor. 0

As 0
the 0
pair 0
started 0
talking, 0
Paddock 0
began 0
firing 0
through 0
the 0
door 0
of 0
his 0
room, 0
first 0
with 0
a 0
single-fire 0
gun 0
and 0
then 0
with 0
a 0
rapid-fire 0
rifle. 0

Police 0
have 0
said 0
that 0
when 0
Campos 0
radioed 0
what 0
happened, 0
it 0
helped 0
them 0
track 0
where 0
Paddock 0
was 0
holed 0
up 0
– 0
so 1
why 1
change 1
the 1
narrative 1
to 1
make 1
it 1
even 1
more 1
unbelievable? 1

And 0
still, 0
none 0
of 0
this 0
explains 0
why 0
Campos 0
is 0
not 0
registered 0
as 0
a 0
security 0
guard 0
either, 0
and 0
why 0
the 0
timeline 0
is 0
being 0
changed 0
publically. 0

What 1
exactly 1
do 1
they 1
want 1
us 1
to 1
believe? 1
