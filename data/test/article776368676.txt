Attorney 0
General 0
Sessions 0
recused 0
himself 0
from 0
overseeing 0
the 0
investigation 0
early 0
in 0
2017. 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
hypothesized 0
that 0
this 0
was 0
done, 0
in 0
part, 0
to 0
avoid 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
conflicts 0
such 0
as 0
that 0
which 0
Trump 0
has 0
proposed. 0

Later, 0
a 0
special 0
counsel, 0
Robert 0
S. 0
Mueller 0
III, 0
was 0
appointed 0
to 0
carry 0
out 0
the 0
investigation. 0

Trump’s 0
lawyers, 0
Rudolph 0
W. 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Jay 0
A. 0
Sekulow, 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
telephone 0
interview 0
that 0
the 0
president 0
was 0
not 0
ordering 0
the 0
inquiry 0
closed 0
but 0
simply 0
expressing 0
his 0
opinion 0
via 0
the 0
social 0
media 0
platform. 0

“It’s 0
not 0
a 0
call 0
to 0
action,” 0
Mr. 0
Giuliani 0
said, 0
adding 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
sentiment 0
that 0
Mr. 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
lawyers 0
have 0
expressed 0
publicly 0
before. 0

“He’s 0
expressing 0
his 0
opinion, 0
but 0
he’s 0
not 0
talking 0
of 0
his 0
special 0
powers 0
he 0
has” 0
as 0
president, 0
Giuliani 0
said. 0

“He 0
doesn’t 0
feel 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
to 0
intervene 0
in 0
the 0
process, 0
nor 0
is 0
he 0
intervening,” 0
said 0
Sekulow. 0

The 0
special 0
counsel 0
is 0
also 0
looking 0
into 0
some 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
tweets 0
about 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Sessions 0
and 0
the 0
former 0
F.B.I. 0

director 0
James 0
Comey 0
and 0
whether 0
the 0
messages 0
were 0
intended 0
to 0
“obstruct 0
the 0
inquiry” 0
into 0
his 0
alleged 0
Russian 0
collusion. 0

Senator 0
Patrick 0
Leahy, 0
a 0
Democrat 0
of 0
Vermont, 0
suggested 0
on 0
Twitter 0
that 0
the 0
president’s 0
directive 0
to 0
Sessions 0
in 0
these 0
recent 0
Tweets 0
was, 0
in 0
fact, 0
obstruction. 0

When 0
I 0
was 0
a 0
prosecutor, 0
obstruction 0
of 0
justice 0
was 0
often 0
hard 0
to 0
prove, 0
requiring 0
difficult-to-obtain 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
individual’s 0
actions 0
were 0
truly 0
intended 0
to 0
interfere 0
with 0
an 0
ongoing 0
criminal 0
investigation. 0

Oh 0
how 0
times 0
have 0
changed. 0
