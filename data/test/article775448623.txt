Credit 1
for 1
this 1
dangerous 1
scenario 1
— 1
in 1
which 1
getting 1

rifle 1
is 1
just 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
a 1
few 1
computer 1
clicks 1
— 1
goes 1
to 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
for 1
its 1
inexplicable 1
decision 1
to 1
settle 1
a 1
lawsuit 1
it 1
was 1
on 1
the 1
verge 1
of 1
winning. 1

The 0
case 0
involves 0
Cody 0
Wilson, 0
founder 0
of 0
Defense 0
Distributed, 0
who 0
sued 0
the 0
government 0
in 0
2015 0
after 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
under 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
made 0
him 0
take 0
down 0
do-it-yourself 0

he 0
had 0
posted 0
online, 0
saying 0
they 0
violated 0
export 0
regulations 0
governing 0
military 0
hardware 0
and 0
technology. 0

Mr. 0
Wilson, 0
an 1
avowed 1
anarchist 1
who 1
hopes 1
for 1
a 1
world 1
in 1
which 1
governments 1
can’t 1
stop 1
individuals 1
from 1
getting 1
guns, 1
claimed 0
his 0
First 0
Amendment 0
right 0
to 0
free 0
speech 0
was 0
being 0
violated. 0

But 0
he 0
lost 0
at 0
every 0
stage 0
of 0
litigation, 0
including 0
a 0
refusal 0
by 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
to 0
review 0
a 0
decision 0
that 0
the 0
code 0
could 0
not 0
be 0
published 0
during 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
lawsuit. 0

So 1
it 1
was 1
stunning 1
— 0
but 1
not 1
surprising, 1
given 1
this 1
administration’s 1
worship 1
at 1
the 1
altar 1
of 1
gun 1
rights 1
— 0
that 0
the 0
State 0

about 0
the 0
issue 0
Wednesday 0
during 0
his 0
appearance 0
before 0
the 0
Senate 0
Foreign 0
Relations 0
Committee. 0

“Why 1
on 1
earth 1
would 1
the 1
Trump 1
administration 1
make 1
it 1
easier 1
for 1
terrorists 1
and 1
gunmen 1
to 1
produce 1
undetectable 1
plastic 1
guns?” 1
asked 0
Sen. 0
Robert 0
Menendez 0
(D-N.J.). 0

Mr. 0
Pompeo 0
promised 0
to 0
“take 0
a 0
look 0
at 0
it.” 0

That’s 0
not 0
enough. 0

Ghost 1
guns 1
are 1
already 1
a 1
problem; 1
they 1
are 1
used 1
not 1
just 1
by 1
lone 1
shooters 1
but 1
as 1
part 1
of 1
criminal 1
enterprises. 1

Releasing 1
instructions 1
for 1
their 1
manufacture, 1
which 1
now 1
only 1
circulate 1
on 1
the 1
dark 1
Web, 1
will 1
lead 1
directly 1
to 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
more 1
innocent 1
lives. 1

The 1
administration 1
should 1
stop 1
the 1
State 1
Department 1
from 1
going 1
ahead 1
with 1
this 1
foolhardy 1
move, 1
and 1
Congress 1
should 1
act 1
to 1
plug 1
the 1
loopholes 1
that 1
these 1
guns 1
are 1
designed 1
to 1
take 1
advantage 1
of. 1
