In 0 88 19
it, 0 88 19
he 0 88 19
claims 0 88 19
that 0 88 19

In 0 88 22
a 0 88 22

were 0 88 22
a 0 88 22
lot 0 88 22
of 0 88 22

He 0 88 22
said 0 88 22
he 0 88 22
had 0 88 22
a 0 88 22
choice, 0 88 22
to 0 88 22
“sit 0 88 22

and 0 88 22
go 0 88 22
to 0 88 22
Hell.” 0 88 22

He 0 88 23
began 0 88 23
his 0 88 23
speech 0 88 23
by 0 88 23
attacking 0 88 23
President 0 88 23

Obama 0 88 23
for 0 88 23
supporting 0 88 23
same-sex 0 88 23
marriage. 0 88 23

He 0 88 24
asked 0 88 24
the 0 88 24
following, 0 88 24
“Did 0 88 24
you 0 88 24
hear 0 88 24
what 0 88 24
President 0 88 24

said?… 0 88 24

a 0 88 24

Here 0 88 25
you 0 88 25
have 0 88 25
the 0 88 25

the 0 88 25

of 0 88 25
America 0 88 25

Are 0 88 25

Do 0 88 26
you 0 88 26
believe 0 88 26
in 0 88 26
the 0 88 26
Quran? 0 88 26

Are 0 88 27
we 0 88 27
gonna 0 88 27
sit 0 88 27
and 0 88 27
have 0 88 27
the 0 88 27
Quran 0 88 27
be 0 88 27
ridiculed?” 0 88 27
He 0 88 27
then 0 88 27
cited 0 88 27
the 0 88 27
Christian 0 88 27
and 0 88 27
Jewish 0 88 27
Bible, 0 88 27
barking 1 88 27
loudly, 0 88 27
“The 0 88 27
Bible 0 88 27
says 0 88 27
that 0 88 27

Shafayat 0 88 28
Mohamed 0 88 28
later 0 88 28
lamented 0 88 28
the 0 88 28
existence 0 88 28
of 0 88 28
Muslim 0 88 28

He 0 88 29
decried, 0 88 29
“Listen. 0 88 29

it. 0 88 30

He 0 88 31
as 0 88 31
well 0 88 31
spoke 0 88 31
of 0 88 31
his 0 88 31

illegal 0 88 31
in 0 88 31
