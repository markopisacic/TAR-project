He 0 139 22
said 0 139 22
he 0 139 22
had 0 139 22
a 0 139 22

He 0 139 23
began 0 139 23

He 0 139 24
asked 0 139 24
the 0 139 24
following, 0 139 24
“Did 0 139 24
you 0 139 24

He 0 139 27
then 0 139 27

Shafayat 0 139 28

the 0 139 28
existence 0 139 28
of 0 139 28
Muslim 0 139 28
homosexuals. 0 139 28

He 0 139 29
decried, 0 139 29
“Listen. 0 139 29

Don’t 0 139 30

communities.” 0 139 31
He 0 139 31
as 0 139 31
well 0 139 31
spoke 0 139 31
of 0 139 31
his 0 139 31
support 0 139 31
for 0 139 31

illegal 0 139 31
in 0 139 31
the 0 139 31
United 0 139 31

He 0 139 32
exclaimed, 0 139 32
“Here 0 139 32
the 0 139 32
President 0 139 32

marry 0 139 32
a 0 139 32
man, 0 139 32
but 0 139 32
you 0 139 32
can’t 0 139 32
