For 0 428 1
any 0 428 1
constitutionalist, 0 428 1
the 0 428 1

Judge 0 428 1
Timothy 0 428 1
J. 0 428 1

was 0 428 1
nothing 1 428 1
but 1 428 1
surreal, 1 428 1
and 0 428 1
honestly, 0 428 1
he 0 428 1
should 0 428 1
be 0 428 1
impeached 0 428 1
over 0 428 1
his 0 428 1
frivolous 1 428 1
ruling 0 428 1
that 0 428 1
demanded 0 428 1
the 0 428 1

However, 0 428 2
the 0 428 2
White 0 428 2
House 0 428 2
has 0 428 2
decided 0 428 2
to 0 428 2
comply, 0 428 2
which 0 428 2
I 0 428 2
wonder 0 428 2
just 0 428 2
how 0 428 2
dangerous 1 428 2
a 0 428 2
precedent 0 428 2
this 0 428 2
sets, 0 428 2
and 0 428 2
as 0 428 2
a 0 428 2
result, 0 428 2
White 0 428 2
House 0 428 2
Press 0 428 2
Secretary 0 428 2
Sarah 0 428 2

for 0 428 2
the 0 428 2
White 0 428 2

We 0 428 3
have 0 428 3
created 0 428 3
these 0 428 3
rules 0 428 3
with 0 428 3
a 0 428 3
degree 0 428 3
of 0 428 3
regret,” 0 428 3
Sanders 0 428 3
said 0 428 3
in 0 428 3
a 0 428 3
statement. 0 428 3

The 0 428 4
fact 0 428 4
that 0 428 4
the 0 428 4
White 0 428 4
House 0 428 4
submitted 0 428 4
to 0 428 4
such 0 428 4
a 0 428 4
ridiculous 1 428 4
demand 0 428 4
when 0 428 4
it 0 428 4

simple 0 428 4

in 0 428 4
a 0 428 4
proper 0 428 4
manner, 0 428 4

“We 0 428 18

of 0 428 18

that 0 428 18

“But, 0 428 19
given 0 428 19
the 0 428 19
position 0 428 19
taken 0 428 19
by 0 428 19

we 0 428 19
now 0 428 19
feel 0 428 19
obligated 0 428 19
to 0 428 19
replace 0 428 19

Oh, 0 428 20
but 0 428 20
there's 0 428 20
more. 0 428 20

If 0 428 21
journalists 0 428 21
can't 0 428 21
conduct 0 428 21
themselves 0 428 21
according 0 428 21
to 0 428 21
these 0 428 21

there 0 428 21
is 0 428 21
no 0 428 21

option 0 428 21

to.... 0 428 21
write 0 428 21
more 0 428 21
explicit 0 428 21
rules! 0 428 21

Seriously! 1 428 22

“At 0 428 23
this 0 428 23
time, 0 428 23
however, 0 428 23
we 0 428 23
have 0 428 23
decided 0 428 23
not 0 428 23
to 0 428 23
frame 0 428 23
such 0 428 23
rules 0 428 23

hope 0 428 23
that 0 428 23
professional 0 428 23
journalistic 0 428 23
norms 0 428 23
will 0 428 23
suffice 0 428 23
to 0 428 23
regulate 0 428 23
conduct 0 428 23
in 0 428 23
those 0 428 23
places,” 0 428 23

“If 0 428 24
unprofessional 0 428 24
behavior 0 428 24

or 0 428 24
if 0 428 24
a 0 428 24
court 0 428 24
should 0 428 24
decide 0 428 24
that 0 428 24
explicit 0 428 24
rules 0 428 24
are 0 428 24
required 0 428 24
to 0 428 24
regulate 0 428 24
conduct 0 428 24
there, 0 428 24
we 0 428 24
will 0 428 24
be 0 428 24
forced 0 428 24
to 0 428 24
reconsider 0 428 24
this 0 428 24
decision.” 0 428 24

The 0 428 25
White 0 428 25
House 0 428 25
should 0 428 25
be 0 428 25
telling 0 428 25

can 0 428 25
take 0 428 25
his 0 428 25
ruling, 0 428 25
but 0 428 25
they 0 428 25
are 0 428 25
trying 0 428 25
to 0 428 25
look 0 428 25
like 0 428 25
they 0 428 25
are 0 428 25
on 0 428 25
the 0 428 25
high 0 428 25

unconstitutional 0 428 25
rulings 0 428 25
from 0 428 25
a 0 428 25
federal 0 428 25

(3) 0 428 27
“Yielding 0 428 27

includes, 0 428 27
when 0 428 27

physically 0 428 27
surrendering 0 428 27

any 0 428 27
of 0 428 27

of 0 428 27

hard 0 428 27
pass. 0 428 27

I 1 428 28
can 1 428 28
see 1 428 28
this 1 428 28
going 1 428 28
way 1 428 28
downhill. 1 428 28

If 0 428 29
you 0 428 29
want 0 428 29
to 0 428 29
deal 0 428 29
with 0 428 29
people 0 428 29
like 0 428 29
Acosta, 0 428 29
at 0 428 29
the 0 428 29
moment 0 428 29
they 0 428 29
begin 0 428 29
to 0 428 29
show 0 428 29
who 0 428 29
and 0 428 29
what 0 428 29
they 0 428 29
really 0 428 29
are, 0 428 29
stop 0 428 29
calling 0 428 29

them 0 428 29
for 0 428 29

This 0 428 30

my 0 428 30
advice 0 428 30

the 0 428 30
White 0 428 30
House. 0 428 30

Don't 0 428 31
call 0 428 31
on 0 428 31
Jim 0 428 31
Acosta 0 428 31
another 0 428 31
time 0 428 31
for 0 428 31
as 0 428 31
long 0 428 31
as 0 428 31
he 0 428 31
remains 0 428 31
in 0 428 31
the 0 428 31
White 0 428 31
House 0 428 31
Press. 0 428 31

Make 0 428 31

him 0 428 31

regret 0 428 31

it 0 428 31

the 0 428 31

entire 0 428 31

time 0 428 31

he 0 428 31

is 0 428 31

there. 0 428 31
