It’s 0 44 0
Spreading 0 44 0
Because 0 44 0

‘Dancing 1 44 0

The 0 44 1
plague 0 44 1
that’s 0 44 1
airborne 0 44 1
and 0 44 1
has 0 44 1
killed 0 44 1
at 0 44 1
least 0 44 1
124 0 44 1
people 0 44 1
in 0 44 1
Madagascar 0 44 1
is 0 44 1
now 0 44 1
blamed 0 44 1
on 0 44 1
“dancing 1 44 1
with 1 44 1
corpses.” 1 44 1
This 0 44 1
is 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
time 0 44 1
of 0 44 1
year 0 44 1
when 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
dead 0 44 1
are 0 44 1
wrapped 0 44 1
in 0 44 1
sheets 0 44 1
and 0 44 1
paraded 0 44 1
through 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
streets 0 44 1
while 0 44 1
others 0 44 1
dance 0 44 1
around 0 44 1
the 0 44 1
bodies. 0 44 1

The 1 44 2
local 1 44 2
tradition 1 44 2
is 1 44 2
said 1 44 2
to 1 44 2
be 1 44 2
one 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
the 1 44 2
major 1 44 2
causes 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
the 1 44 2
spread 1 44 2
of 1 44 2
this 1 44 2
disease. 1 44 2

Since 0 44 3
it’s 0 44 3
airborne, 0 44 3
anyone 0 44 3
coming 0 44 3
close 0 44 3
to 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
corpse 0 44 3
of 0 44 3
a 0 44 3
person 0 44 3
who 0 44 3
has 0 44 3
died 0 44 3
of 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
black 0 44 3
death 0 44 3
could 0 44 3
themselves, 0 44 3
catch 0 44 3
the 0 44 3
infection. 0 44 3

Health 1 44 4
officials 1 44 4
suspect 1 44 4
it’s 1 44 4
no 1 44 4
coincidence 1 44 4
that 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
outbreak 1 44 4
coincides 1 44 4
with 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
time 1 44 4
of 1 44 4
year 1 44 4
when 1 44 4
families 1 44 4
customarily 1 44 4
exhume 1 44 4
the 1 44 4
remains 1 44 4
of 1 44 4
dead 1 44 4
relatives, 1 44 4
wrap 0 44 4
them 0 44 4
in 0 44 4
a 0 44 4
sheet, 0 44 4
and 0 44 4
dance 0 44 4
with 0 44 4
them 0 44 4
through 0 44 4
the 0 44 4
streets 0 44 4
in 0 44 4
a 0 44 4

Some 1 44 6
locals 1 44 6
believe 1 44 6
the 1 44 6
whole 1 44 6
plague 1 44 6
is 1 44 6
some 1 44 6
kind 1 44 6
of 1 44 6
a 1 44 6
government 1 44 6
conspiracy, 1 44 6
and 0 44 6
say 0 44 6
they 0 44 6
have 0 44 6
no 0 44 6
intention 0 44 6
of 0 44 6
forgoing 0 44 6
the 0 44 6
ritual 0 44 6
known 0 44 6
as 0 44 6
“famadihana.” 0 44 6
They 0 44 6
say 0 44 6
they 0 44 6
will 0 44 6
continue 0 44 6
to 0 44 6
dance 0 44 6
with 0 44 6
the 0 44 6
dead 0 44 6

“I 0 44 7

The 1 44 8
plague 1 44 8
is 1 44 8
a 1 44 8
lie,” 1 44 8
Helene 0 44 8

believes 0 44 9
the 0 44 9
country’s 0 44 9
cash-strapped 1 44 9

just 1 44 9

it 1 44 10
isn’t 1 44 10
that 1 44 10
anyone 1 44 10
