on 0
Tuesday 0
released 0
a 0
sweeping 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
on 0
sex 0
abuse 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
listing 0
hundreds 0

accused 0
clergy 0
and 0
detailing 0
70 0
years 0
of 0
misconduct 0
and 0
church 0
response 0
across 0
the 0
state. 0

The 0

release 0
is 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
an 0
18-month 0
probe, 0
led 0
by 0
state 0
Attorney 0
General 0
Josh 0
Shapiro, 0
on 0
six 0
of 0
the 0
state’s 0
eight 0
dioceses 0
— 0
Harrisburg, 0
Pittsburgh, 0
Allentown, 0
Scranton, 0

— 0
and 0
follows 0

state 0
grand 0
jury 0
reports 0
that 0
revealed 0
abuse 0
and 0
coverups 0
in 0
two 0
other 0
dioceses. 0

Some 0

details 0
and 0
names 0
that 0
might 0
reveal 0
the 0
300 0
clergy 0
listed 0
have 0
been 0
redacted 0
from 0
the 0
report. 0

Legal 0
challenges 0
by 0
clergy 0
delayed 0
the 0
report’s 0
release, 0
after 0
some 0
said 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
violation 0
of 0
their 0
constitutional 0
rights. 0

Pennsylvania’s 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
ruled 0
last 0
month 0
that 0
the 0
report 0
must 0
be 0
released 0
but 0
with 0
some 0
redaction. 0

The 0

report’s 0
release 0
begins 0
an 1
information 1
war, 1
with 0
prosecutors 0
and 0
many 0
victims 0
saying 0
it’s 0
the 0
start 0
of 0
holding 0
church 0
leaders 0
at 0
the 0
top 0
accountable 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time, 0
while 0
church 0
lawyers 0
and 0
other 0
advocates 0
for 0
the 0
institution 0
say 0
the 0
report 0
depicts 0
an 0
era 0
of 0
another 0
century, 0
unfairly 1
smearing 1
today’s 0
Catholicism 0
in 0
Pennsylvania. 0

The 0

report 0
has 0
helped 0
renew 0
a 0
crisis 0
many 0
in 0
the 0
church 0
thought 0
and 0
hoped 0
had 0
ended 0
nearly 0
20 0
years 0
ago 0
after 1
the 1
scandal 1
erupted 1
in 0
Boston. 0

But 1
recent 1
abuse-related 1
scandals, 1
from 1
Chile 1
to 1
Australia, 1
have 1
reopened 1
wounding 1
questions 1
about 1
accountability 1
and 1
whether 1
church 1
officials 1
are 1
still 1
covering 1
up 1
crimes 1
at 1
the 1
highest 1
levels. 1

The 1

new 1
wave 1
of 1
allegations 1
has 1
called 1
Pope 1
Francis’s 1
handling 1
of 1
abuse 1
into 1
question 1
as 1
many 1
Catholics 1
look 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
help 1
the 1
church 1
regain 1
its 1
credibility. 1

The 1
pope’s 1
track 1
record 1
has 1
been 1
mixed, 1
something 1
some 1
outsiders 1
attribute 1
to 1
his 1
learning 1
curve 1
or 1
shortcomings 1
and 0
others 0
chalk 0
up 0
to 0
resistance 0
from 0
a 1
notoriously 1
change-averse 1
institution. 1

The 0

Pennsylvania 0
grand 0
jury 0
report 0
follows 0
the 0
resignation 0
last 0
month 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick, 0
a 1
towering 1
figure 1
in 1
the 1
U.S. 1
church 1
and 0
former 0
D.C. 0
archbishop 0
who 0
was 0
accused 0
of 0
sexually 0
abusing 0
minors 0
and 0
adults 0
for 0
decades. 0

Both 0
have 0
further 0
polarized 0
the 0
church 0
on 0
homosexuality, 0
celibacy 0
and 0
whether 0
laypeople 0
should 0
have 0
more 0
power. 0

It 0
has 0
also 0
triggered 0
debate 0
about 0
whether 0
statutes 0
of 0
limitations 0
should 0
be 0
expanded. 0

“We’re 0

dealing 0
with 0
a 0
long-term 0
struggle 0
not 0
only 0
about 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
justice, 0
but 0
about 0
the 0
meaning 0
of 0
memory,” 0
said 0
Jason 0
Berry, 0
a 0
reporter 0
and 0
author 0
who 0
has 0
covered 0
the 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
crisis 0
for 0
decades. 0

“And 1
how 1
honest 1
the 1
church 1
has 1
been 1
about 1
this 1
crisis. 1

Most 1
bishops, 1
besides 1
apologies, 1
have 1
not 1
been 1
on 1
the 1
cutting 1
edge 1
of 1
change.” 1

Church 0

officials 0
began 0
bracing 0
for 0
the 0
aftermath 0
of 0
the 0
report. 0

On 0
Monday, 0
D.C.’s 0
archbishop, 0
Cardinal 0
Donald 0
Wuerl, 0
former 0
longtime 0
leader 0
of 0
the 0
Pittsburgh 0
diocese, 0
warned 0
his 0
priests 0
in 0
a 0
letter 0
that 0
the 0
probe 0
will 0
be 0
“profoundly 1
disturbing.” 1

REMNANT 0
COMMENT: 0
The 0
report 0
also 0
shows 0
that 0
“more 0
than 0
90 0
‘offenders’ 0
will 0
be 0
listed” 0
in 0
Donald 0
Cardinal 0
Wuerl’s 0
former 0
diocese, 0
which 0
is 0
ironic 0
since 0
Wuerl 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’s 0
closest 0
U.S. 0
advisers 0
and 0
sits 0
on 0
the 0
Vatican’s 0
bishop 0
oversight 0
committee. 0

Well 1
played, 1
Cardinal 1
Wuerl! 1

So, 0
let 0
me 0
get 0
this 0
straight 0
(I 0
know, 1
lots 1
of 1
luck 1
with 1
that 1
one): 1
These 1
are 1
the 1
people 1
that 1
are 1
going 1
to 1
"accompany 1
us" 1
and 1
our 1
children 1
in 1
the 1
"synodal 1
Church" 1
with 1
its 1
new 1
orientation, 1
overseen 0
by 0
a 1
"God 1
of 1
Surprises" 1
who 1
is 1
uber-merciful 1
and 1
doesn't 1
judge, 1
and 0
headed 0
up 0
by 0
a 1
pope 1
who, 1
according 1
to 1
Father 1
Thomas 1
Rosica, 1
"breaks 1
Catholic 1
traditions 1
whenever 1
he 1
wants, 1
because 1
he 1
is 1
'free 1
from 1
disordered 1
attachments'?'' 1

You 1
don't 1
say! 1

All 1
this 1
and 1
rampant 1
homosexuality 1
in 1
the 1
priesthood, 1
too... 1
along 1
with 1
a 1
"trivialized 1
liturgy" 1
(according 1
to 1
Pope 1
Benedict 1
XVI) 1
and 1
widespread 1
apostasy 1
among 1
the 1
faithful? 1

Remind 1
me 1
again: 1
What 1
exactly 1
has 1
Vatican 1
II 1
and 1
the 1
last 1
fifty 1
years 1
of 1
aggiornamento 1
given 1
us? 1

Because 1
I 1
can't 1
seem 1
to 1
think 1
of 1
a 1
darn 1
thing, 1
apart 1
from 1
heretical 1
homilies, 1
sodomitical 1
clergy 1
and 1
an 1
increasingly 1
lavender 1
liturgy. 1

You 1
know 1
what, 1
guys? 1

Thanks, 1
but 1
no 1
thanks. 1

You 1
can 1
take 1
your 1
'Church 1
of 1
Accompaniment" 1
to 1
prison 1
with 1
you. 1

I'd 1
sooner 1
let 1
my 1
kids 1
be 1
accompanied 1
by 1
fans 1
of 1
the 1
Oakland 1
Raiders 1
than 1
turn 1
them 1
over 1
to 1
you... 1
meaning 0
no 0
disrespect 0
to 0
fans 0
of 0
the 0
Oakland 0
Raiders, 0
of 0
course. 0
