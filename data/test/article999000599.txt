Being 0 85 2
the 0 85 2

of 0 85 2
political-correctness 0 85 2

this 0 85 2

questions 0 85 2
about 0 85 2
just 1 85 2
how 1 85 2
evil 1 85 2
and 1 85 2

The 0 85 3
conversation 0 85 3
began 0 85 3
normally, 0 85 3
with 0 85 3
Clinton 0 85 3
hypocritically 1 85 3
toeing 1 85 3
the 0 85 3
progressive 0 85 3
line 0 85 3
of 0 85 3
identity 0 85 3
politics 0 85 3
by 0 85 3
explaining 0 85 3
how 0 85 3
each 0 85 3
of 0 85 3
the 0 85 3
groups 0 85 3
are 0 85 3
different 0 85 3
but 0 85 3
can 0 85 3
be 0 85 3
managed 0 85 3
by 0 85 3
the 0 85 3
same 0 85 3
liberal 0 85 3
movement: 0 85 3

“What’s 0 85 4
often 0 85 4
called 0 85 4
political 0 85 4
correctness 0 85 4
is 0 85 4
politeness,” 0 85 4
Clinton 0 85 4
said. 0 85 4

“It’s 0 85 5
not 0 85 5
being 0 85 5
rude 0 85 5
and 0 85 5
insulting 0 85 5
to 0 85 5
people. 0 85 5

It’s 0 85 6
respecting 0 85 6
the 0 85 6
diversity 0 85 6
that 0 85 6
we 0 85 6
have 0 85 6
in 0 85 6
our 0 85 6
society,” 0 85 6
she 0 85 6
said. 0 85 6

“The 0 85 7
Democratic 0 85 7
Party 0 85 7
is 0 85 7
a 0 85 7
much 0 85 7
more 0 85 7
diverse 0 85 7
political 0 85 7
party, 0 85 7
attracting 0 85 7
people 0 85 7
who 0 85 7
are 0 85 7
African-American, 0 85 7
Latino, 0 85 7
LGBT, 0 85 7
whatever 0 85 7
the 0 85 7
reason 0 85 7
why 0 85 7
people 0 85 7
feel 0 85 7
more 0 85 7
comfortable 0 85 7
where 0 85 7
they 0 85 7
are 0 85 7
taken 0 85 7
in, 0 85 7
where 0 85 7
they 0 85 7
are 0 85 7
included 0 85 7
as 0 85 7
part 0 85 7
of 0 85 7
a 0 85 7
political 0 85 7
movement 0 85 7
or 0 85 7
party.” 0 85 7
“And 0 85 7
I 0 85 7
don’t 0 85 7
think 0 85 7
it’s 0 85 7
politically 0 85 7
correct 0 85 7
to 0 85 7
say 0 85 7
we 0 85 7
value 0 85 7
that. 0 85 7

And 0 85 8
I 0 85 8
don’t 0 85 8
want 0 85 8
to 0 85 8
go 0 85 8
around 0 85 8
insulting 0 85 8
people. 0 85 8

I 0 85 9
don’t 0 85 9
want 0 85 9
to 0 85 9
paint 0 85 9
with 0 85 9
a 0 85 9
broad 0 85 9
brush 0 85 9
every 0 85 9
immigrant 0 85 9
is 0 85 9
this, 0 85 9
every 0 85 9
African-American 0 85 9
is 0 85 9
that, 0 85 9
every, 0 85 9
you 0 85 9
know, 0 85 9
other 0 85 9
person 0 85 9
with 0 85 9
different 0 85 9
religious 0 85 9
beliefs 0 85 9
or 0 85 9
whatever 0 85 9
– 0 85 9
that’s 1 85 9
childish.” 1 85 9

Childish, 1 85 10
indeed. 1 85 10

Insulting, 1 85 11
indeed. 1 85 11

Just 0 85 12
30 0 85 12
seconds 0 85 12
later, 0 85 12
as 0 85 12
Swisher 0 85 12
asked: 0 85 12

“what 0 85 13
do 0 85 13
you 0 85 13
think 0 85 13
of 0 85 13
Cory 0 85 13
Booker… 0 85 13
saying 0 85 13
‘kick 1 85 13
them 1 85 13
in 1 85 13
the 1 85 13
shins,’ 1 85 13
essentially…” 0 85 13
incorrectly 0 85 13
recalling 0 85 13
Eric 0 85 13
Holder’s 0 85 13
recent 0 85 13
comments. 0 85 13

Which 0 85 14
Clinton 0 85 14
quickly 0 85 14
corrected: 0 85 14

“Well 0 85 15
that 0 85 15
was 0 85 15
Eric 0 85 15
Holder…” 0 85 15

Adding, 0 85 16
rather 1 85 16
extraordinarily, 1 85 16

“Yeah, 0 85 17
I 0 85 17
know 0 85 17
they 0 85 17
all 0 85 17
look 0 85 17
alike,” 0 85 17
Clinton 0 85 17
joked, 0 85 17
triggering 0 85 17
howls 0 85 17
of 0 85 17
laughter 0 85 17
from 0 85 17
the 0 85 17
apparently 0 85 17
mind-numbed 0 85 17
audience. 0 85 17

Sorry 1 85 18
Hillary, 1 85 18
we 1 85 18
don’t 1 85 18
think 1 85 18
they 1 85 18
look 1 85 18
anything 1 85 18
alike. 1 85 18

Or 1 85 19
did 1 85 19
you 1 85 19
mean 1 85 19
all 1 85 19
black 1 85 19
people? 1 85 19

Finally, 0 85 20
we 0 85 20
have 0 85 20
one 0 85 20
question 0 85 20
– 0 85 20
what 0 85 20
would 0 85 20
have 0 85 20
happened 0 85 20
if 0 85 20
Trump 0 85 20
said 0 85 20
it? 0 85 20

As 1 85 20

The 1 85 20

American 1 85 20

Mirror’s 1 85 20

Kyle 1 85 20

Olsen 1 85 20

concludes 1 85 20

so 1 85 20

eloquently, 1 85 20

Hillary 1 85 20

Clinton 1 85 20

appears 1 85 20

to 1 85 20

benefit 1 85 20

from 1 85 20

her 1 85 20

progressive 1 85 20

privilege 1 85 20

– 1 85 20

it 1 85 20

is 1 85 20

the 1 85 20

only 1 85 20

thing 1 85 20

that 1 85 20

protects 1 85 20

her 1 85 20

from 1 85 20

getting 1 85 20

the 1 85 20

‘Roseanne 1 85 20

treatment’, 1 85 20

and 1 85 20

not 1 85 20

being 1 85 20

dismissed 1 85 20

in 1 85 20

disgrace. 1 85 20
