“Weighing 0
the 0
Allegations 0
against 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh,” 0
by 0
David 0
French, 0
National 0
Review, 0
September 0
16, 0
2018: 0

They’re 0
serious 0
but 0
not 0
solid. 0

The 0
allegations 0
against 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
— 0
outlined 0
now 0
on 0
the 0
record 0
in 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
by 0
Palo 0
Alto 0
University 0
professor 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford 0
— 0
are 0
substantial 0
and 0
serious. 0

She 0
claims 0
that 0
Kavanaugh 0
knocked 0
her 0
down, 0
groped 0
her, 0
and 0
attempted 0
to 0
remove 0
her 0
clothes. 0

Here’s 0
the 0
core 0
of 0
her 0
story: 0

While 0
his 0
friend 0
watched, 0
she 0
said, 0
Kavanaugh 0
pinned 0
her 0
to 0
a 0
bed 0
on 0
her 0
back 0
and 0
groped 0
her 0
over 0
her 0
clothes, 0
grinding 0
his 0
body 0
against 0
hers 0
and 0
clumsily 0
attempting 0
to 0
pull 0
off 0
her 0
one-piece 0
bathing 0
suit 0
and 0
the 0
clothing 0
she 0
wore 0
over 0
it. 0

When 0
she 0
tried 0
to 0
scream, 0
she 0
said, 0
he 0
put 0
his 0
hand 0
over 0
her 0
mouth. 0

“I 0
thought 0
he 0
might 0
inadvertently 0
kill 0
me,” 0
said 0
Ford, 0
now 0
a 0
51-year-old 0
research 0
psychologist 0
in 0
northern 0
California. 0

“He 0
was 0
trying 0
to 0
attack 0
me 0
and 0
remove 0
my 0
clothing.” 0
Ford 0
said 0
she 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
escape 0
when 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
friend 0
and 0
classmate 0
at 0
Georgetown 0
Preparatory 0
School, 0
Mark 0
Judge, 0
jumped 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
them, 0
sending 0
all 0
three 0
tumbling. 0

She 0
said 0
she 0
ran 0
from 0
the 0
room, 0
briefly 0
locked 0
herself 0
in 0
a 0
bathroom 0
and 0
then 0
fled 0
the 0
house. 0

Do 0
not 0
count 0
me 0
among 0
those 0
who 0
would 0
minimize 0
this 0
alleged 0
assault. 0

I 0
went 0
to 0
a 0
high 0
school 0
that 0
had 0
more 0
than 0
its 0
share 0
of 0
drunken 0
parties, 0
and 0
my 0
classmates 0
could 0
do 0
crazy 0
and 0
stupid 0
things, 0
but 0
an 0
act 0
like 0
this 0
was 0
beyond 0
the 0
pale. 0

This 0
isn’t 0
“boys 1
will 1
be 1
boys.” 1
Actions 0
have 0
consequences, 0
and 0
it’s 0
hardly 0
unjust 0
to 0
tell 0
a 0
person 0
that 0
if 0
he 0
mistreated 0
another 0
human 0
being 0
like 0
this 0
— 0
even 0
a 0
long 0
time 0
ago 0
— 0
he 0
has 0
to 0
remain 0
“merely” 0
a 0
judge 0
on 0
the 0
D.C. 0

Circuit 0
Court 0
of 0
Appeals. 0

Since 0
Kavanaugh 0
has 0
denied 0
the 0
story, 0
however, 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
whether 0
the 0
event 0
is 0
so 0
egregious 0
that 0
it 0
should 0
disqualify 0
him 0
is 0
moot. 0

At 0
the 0
very 0
least, 0
if 0
the 0
attack 0
happened, 0
he 0
should 0
be 0
disqualified 0
for 0
lying. 0

Yet 0
unless 0
all 0
parties 0
start 0
telling 0
the 0
same 0
story, 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
way 0
to 0
know 0
for 0
certain 0
if 0
this 0
event 0
occurred. 0

We 0
don’t 0
need 0
certainty, 0
however, 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
decision 0
on 0
whether 0
a 0
man 0
should 0
sit 0
on 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court. 0

I 0
have 0
the 0
same 0
standard 0
for 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
as 0
I 0
did 0
for 0
Roy 0
Moore, 0
for 0
Donald 0
Trump, 0
for 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
— 0
or 0
for 0
any 0
other 0
politician 0
who’s 0
accused 0
of 0
misconduct. 0

Is 0
it 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
the 0
allegation 0
is 0
true? 0

Given 0
the 0
totality 0
of 0
the 0
evidence, 0
I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
committed 0
rape 0
and 0
sexual 0
harassment. 0

I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
has 0
committed 0
sexual 0
assault. 0

I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
likely 0
than 0
not 0
that 0
Roy 0
Moore 0
engaged 0
in 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
with 0
underage 0
girls. 0

But 0
the 0
evidence 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
falls 0
far 0
short 0
of 0
the 0
evidence 0
arrayed 0
against 0
each 0
of 0
these 0
men. 0

So 0
far 0
at 0
least 0
it 1
falls 1
far 1
short 1
of 1
the 1
evidence 1
against 1
virtually 1
any 1
other 1
politician 1
or 1
celebrity 1
who 1
has 1
faced 1
consequences 1
during 0
this 0
#MeToo 0
moment. 0

Here’s 0
why: 0

First, 0
one 0
way 0
to 0
help 0
test 0
the 0
veracity 0
of 0
old 0
claims 0
is 0
to 0
ask 0
whether 0
there 0
is 0
any 0
contemporaneous 0
corroboration. 0

Did 0
the 0
accuser 0
tell 0
a 0
friend 0
or 0
family 0
member 0
or 0
anyone 0
about 0
the 0
alleged 0
assault 0
when 0
it 0
occurred? 0

With 0
Clinton, 0
Trump, 0
Moore, 0
and 0
many 0
other 0
politicians 0
and 0
celebrities, 0
there 0
was 0
ample 0
contemporaneous 0
corroboration. 0

Here, 0
there 0
was 0
not. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post, 0
“Ford 0
said 0
she 0
told 0
no 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
incident 0
in 0
any 0
detail 0
until 0
2012, 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
in 0
couples 0
therapy 0
with 0
her 0
husband.” 0

That’s 0
almost 0
three 0
decades 0
of 0
silence 0
— 0
three 0
decades 0
when 0
memories 0
can 0
grow 0
cloudy 0
and 0
recollections 0
can 0
change. 0

But 0
even 0
the 0
allegedly 0
corroborating 0
notes 0
of 0
the 0
therapist 0
raise 0
a 0
separate 0
problem. 0

They 0
actually 0
contradict 0
her 0
story 0
on 0
a 0
key 0
detail. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Post, 0
“The 0
notes 0
say 0
four 0
boys 0
were 0
involved, 0
a 0
discrepancy 0
that 0
Ford 0
says 0
was 0
an 0
error 0
on 0
the 0
therapist’s 0
part. 0

Ford 0
said 0
there 0
were 0
four 0
boys 0
at 0
the 0
party 0
but 0
only 0
two 0
in 0
the 0
room.” 0
Nor 0
do 0
the 0
notes 0
mention 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
name, 0
even 0
though 0
her 0
husband 0
says 0
Ford 0
named 0
Kavanaugh 0
in 0
the 0
sessions. 0

Those 0
are 0
important 0
discrepancies, 0
and 1
if 1
six 1
years 1
ago 1
she 1
told 1
the 1
therapist 1
four 1
men 1
and 1
says 1
two 1
men 1
now, 1
that 1
suggests 1
that 1
her 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
event 1
may 1
be 1
suspect. 1

As 0
a 0
former 0
trial 0
lawyer, 0
I 1
can 1
tell 1
you 1
that 1
while 1
neither 1
notes 1
nor 1
memories 1
are 1
infallible, 1
in 1
a 1
contest 1
between 1
contemporaneous 1
notes 1
and 1
later 1
verbal 1
testimony 1
about 1
those 1
notes, 1
the 1
content 1
of 1
the 1
written 1
notes 1
usually 1
prevails. 1

Juries 0
are 0
extremely 1
skeptical 1
of 0
witnesses 0
who 0
contradict 0
written 0
notes 0
— 0
after 0
all, 0
the 0
notes 0
are 0
taken 0
when 0
the 0
words 0
are 0
immediate 0
and 0
there 0
isn’t 0
the 0
overwhelming 0
pressure 0
of 0
a 0
trial 0
to 0
conform 0
your 0
testimony 0
to 0
the 0
desired 0
outcome. 0

At 0
least 0
the 0
investigation 0
seems 0
somewhat 0
manageable. 0

If 0
there 0
were 0
only 0
four 0
boys 0
there, 0
who 0
were 0
the 0
other 0
two? 0

Let’s 0
hear 0
from 0
them. 0

In 0
fact, 0
investigators 0
should 0
interview 0
everyone 0
else 0
at 0
the 0
party. 0

Yet 0
given 0
all 0
the 0
years 0
that 0
have 0
passed, 0
would 0
it 0
be 0
possible 0
to 0
find 0
anyone 0
who 0
remembers 0
being 0
at 0
that 0
party? 0

Would 0
they 0
remember 0
any 0
details 0
at 0
all? 0

If 0
someone 0
saw 0
Kavanaugh 0
stumbling 1
drunk 1
at 0
the 0
party, 0
that 0
would 0
obviously 0
bolster 0
Ford’s 0
account. 0

If 0
another 0
attendee 0
says, 0
“He 0
was 0
totally 0
sober 0
and 0
with 0
me 0
the 0
whole 0
time,” 0
that 0
helps 0
Kavanaugh. 0

But 0
the 0
odds 0
of 0
getting 0
details 0
that 0
precise 0
are 0
long 0
indeed, 0
and 0
there 0
is 0
always 0
a 0
chance 0
that 0
a 0
motivated 0
classmate 0
might 0
lie 0
— 0
for 0
either 0
person…. 0
