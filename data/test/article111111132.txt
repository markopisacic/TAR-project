Trenton’s 0 208 21

“I 0 208 22

it’s 0 208 22
a 0 208 22
great 0 208 22

a 0 208 25
teacher 0 208 25
in 0 208 25
the 0 208 25

“It’s 0 208 26
not 0 208 26
teaching 0 208 26

it 0 208 26
teaches 0 208 26

how 0 208 26

it 0 208 26

to 0 208 26

“The 0 208 27

the 0 208 28
suit 0 208 28

their 0 208 28

argue 0 208 28
that 0 208 28
the 0 208 28

shouldn’t 0 208 28

The 0 208 29

lessons 0 208 29
in 0 208 29
the 0 208 29
Mercer 0 208 29

similar 0 208 29
to 0 208 29
what 0 208 29
a 0 208 29

hear 0 208 29
in 0 208 29

that 0 208 29

the 0 208 29
Bible 0 208 29
as 0 208 29
historical 0 208 29
fact. 0 208 29

The 0 208 30
suit 0 208 30
quotes 0 208 30
from 0 208 30
one 0 208 30
lesson: 0 208 30
“If 0 208 30
all 0 208 30
of 0 208 30
the 0 208 30
Israelites 0 208 30

chosen 0 208 30
to 0 208 30
follow 0 208 30
the 0 208 30

how 0 208 30

happy 0 208 30
they 0 208 30
would 0 208 30
have 0 208 30
been.” 0 208 30
Another 0 208 30
lesson 0 208 30
asks 0 208 30
students 0 208 30
to 0 208 30
imagine 0 208 30
that 0 208 30
humans 0 208 30

dinosaurs 0 208 30
existed 0 208 30
at 0 208 30
the 0 208 30
same 0 208 30
time. 0 208 30

It 0 208 31
says: 0 208 31
“So 0 208 31
picture 0 208 31
Adam 0 208 31

the 0 208 31

He 0 208 32

Wouldn’t 0 208 33

The 0 208 34
