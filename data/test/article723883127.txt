that 0 119 7
until 0 119 7
he 0 119 7

proof 0 119 7
that 0 119 7

Karadima, 0 119 8
such 0 119 8
accusations 0 119 8
against 0 119 8
Barros 0 119 8
are 0 119 8
“all 1 119 8
calumny.” 1 119 8
The 0 119 8
pope’s 0 119 8
remarks 0 119 8
drew 0 119 8
shock 1 119 8

from 0 119 8
victims 0 119 8
and 0 119 8
their 0 119 8
advocates. 0 119 8

They 0 119 9
noted 0 119 9
the 0 119 9
accusers 0 119 9
were 0 119 9
deemed 0 119 9
credible 0 119 9
enough 0 119 9
by 0 119 9
the 0 119 9
Vatican 0 119 9
that 0 119 9
it 0 119 9
sentenced 0 119 9
Karadima 0 119 9
to 0 119 9
a 0 119 9
lifetime 0 119 9
of 0 119 9
“penance 0 119 9

prayer” 0 119 9
for 0 119 9
his 0 119 9
crimes 0 119 9
in 0 119 9
2011. 0 119 9

A 0 119 10
Chilean 0 119 10
judge 0 119 10
also 0 119 10
found 0 119 10
the 0 119 10
victims 0 119 10
to 0 119 10
be 0 119 10
credible, 0 119 10
saying 0 119 10
that 0 119 10
while 0 119 10
she 0 119 10
had 0 119 10
to 0 119 10
drop 0 119 10
criminal 0 119 10
charges 0 119 10
against 0 119 10
Karadima 0 119 10
because 0 119 10
too 0 119 10
much 0 119 10
time 0 119 10
had 0 119 10
passed, 0 119 10
proof 0 119 10
of 0 119 10
his 0 119 10
crimes 0 119 10
wasn’t 0 119 10
lacking. 0 119 10

[…] 0 119 11
The 0 119 11
Karadima 0 119 11
scandal 0 119 11
dominated 0 119 11
Francis’ 0 119 11
visit 0 119 11
to 0 119 11
Chile 0 119 11
and 0 119 11
the 0 119 11
overall 0 119 11
issue 0 119 11
of 0 119 11
sex 0 119 11
abuse 0 119 11
and 0 119 11
church 0 119 11
cover-up 0 119 11
was 0 119 11
likely 0 119 11
to 0 119 11
factor 0 119 11
into 0 119 11
his 0 119 11
three-day 0 119 11
trip 0 119 11
to 0 119 11
Peru 0 119 11
that 0 119 11
began 0 119 11
late 0 119 11
Thursday. 0 119 11

Karadima’s 0 119 12
victims 0 119 12
reported 0 119 12
to 0 119 12
church 0 119 12
authorities 0 119 12
as 0 119 12
early 0 119 12
as 0 119 12
2002 0 119 12
that 0 119 12
he 0 119 12
would 0 119 12
kiss 1 119 12
and 1 119 12
fondle 1 119 12
them 1 119 12
in 1 119 12
the 1 119 12
swank 1 119 12
Santiago 0 119 12
parish 0 119 12
he 0 119 12
ran, 0 119 12
but 0 119 12
officials 0 119 12
refused 0 119 12
to 0 119 12
believe 0 119 12
them. 0 119 12

Only 0 119 13
when 0 119 13
the 0 119 13
victims 0 119 13
went 0 119 13
public 0 119 13
with 0 119 13
their 0 119 13
accusations 0 119 13
in 0 119 13
2010 0 119 13
did 0 119 13
the 0 119 13
Vatican 0 119 13
launch 0 119 13
an 0 119 13
investigation 0 119 13
that 0 119 13
led 0 119 13
to 0 119 13
Karadima 0 119 13
being 0 119 13
removed 0 119 13
from 0 119 13
ministry. 0 119 13

The 0 119 14
emeritus 0 119 14
archbishop 0 119 14
of 0 119 14
Santiago 0 119 14
subsequently 0 119 14
apologized 0 119 14
for 0 119 14
having 0 119 14
refused 0 119 14
to 0 119 14
believe 0 119 14
the 0 119 14
victims 0 119 14
from 0 119 14
the 0 119 14
start. 0 119 14

One 0 119 15
of 0 119 15
the 0 119 15
victims 0 119 15
made 0 119 15
clear 0 119 15
his 0 119 15
disgust 0 119 15
at 0 119 15
Pope 0 119 15
Francis 0 119 15
for 0 119 15
essentially 0 119 15
covering 0 119 15
up 0 119 15
for 0 119 15
a 0 119 15
man 0 119 15
who 0 119 15
watched 0 119 15
as 0 119 15
another 0 119 15
bishop 0 119 15
sexually 0 119 15
abused 0 119 15
him. 0 119 15

“As 0 119 16
if 0 119 16
I 0 119 16
could 0 119 16
have 0 119 16
taken 0 119 16
a 0 119 16
selfie 0 119 16
or 0 119 16
a 0 119 16
photo 0 119 16
while 0 119 16
Karadima 0 119 16
abused 0 119 16
me 0 119 16
and 0 119 16
others 0 119 16
and 0 119 16
Juan 0 119 16
Barros 0 119 16
stood 0 119 16
by 0 119 16
watching 0 119 16
it 0 119 16
all,” 0 119 16
tweeted 0 119 16
Juan 0 119 16
Carlos 0 119 16
Cruz. 0 119 16

“These 1 119 17
people 1 119 17
are 1 119 17
truly 1 119 17
crazy, 1 119 17
and 0 119 17
the 0 119 17
pontiff 0 119 17
talks 0 119 17
about 0 119 17
atonement 0 119 17
to 0 119 17
the 0 119 17
victims. 0 119 17

Nothing 0 119 18
has 0 119 18
changed, 0 119 18
and 0 119 18
his 0 119 18
plea 0 119 18
for 0 119 18
forgiveness 0 119 18
is 0 119 18
empty.” 0 119 18

This 0 119 18

obviously 0 119 18

does 0 119 18

not 0 119 18

look 0 119 18

good 0 119 18

they 0 119 18

are 0 119 18

engaging 0 119 18

in 0 119 18

attacking 0 119 18

the 0 119 18

victims 0 119 18
