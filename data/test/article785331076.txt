Preliminary 0 83 17
information 0 83 17
suggests 0 83 17
that 0 83 17
the 0 83 17
officer 0 83 17
arrived 0 83 17
home 0 83 17
in 0 83 17

she 0 83 18
entered 0 83 18
the 0 83 18
victim’s 0 83 18
apartment 0 83 18
believing 0 83 18
that 0 83 18
it 0 83 18

At 0 83 19
some 0 83 19
point, 0 83 19
the 0 83 19
officer 0 83 19

a 0 83 20
26-year-old 0 83 20
male, 0 83 20
at 0 83 20
the 0 83 20
scene. 0 83 20

The 0 83 21
victim 0 83 21
was 0 83 21
then 0 83 21
transported 0 83 21
to 0 83 21
the 0 83 21

made 0 83 22
at 0 83 22
this 0 83 22
time. 0 83 22

The 0 83 23
officer 0 83 23
was 0 83 23
not 0 83 23
injured 0 83 23
and 0 83 23
will 0 83 23
be 0 83 23
placed 0 83 23
on 0 83 23
administrative 0 83 23
leave 0 83 23
pending 0 83 23
the 0 83 23
outcome 0 83 23
of 0 83 23
the 0 83 23
investigation. 0 83 23

The 0 83 24
Dallas 0 83 24
Police 0 83 24
Department 0 83 24
is 0 83 24
conducting 0 83 24
a 0 83 24
joint 0 83 24
investigation 0 83 24
with 0 83 24
the 0 83 24
District 0 83 24
Attorney’s 0 83 24
Office. 0 83 24

This 0 83 25
investigation 0 83 25
is 0 83 25
ongoing 0 83 25
and 0 83 25
we 0 83 25
will 0 83 25
release 0 83 25
additional 0 83 25
details 0 83 25
as 0 83 25
they 0 83 25
become 0 83 25
available 0 83 25
and 0 83 25
it 0 83 25
is 0 83 25
appropriate 0 83 25
to 0 83 25
do 0 83 25
so. 0 83 25

If 0 83 26
an 0 83 26
average 0 83 26
citizen 0 83 26
walked 0 83 26
into 0 83 26
the 0 83 26
wrong 0 83 26
home 0 83 26
and 0 83 26
shot 0 83 26
and 0 83 26
killed 0 83 26
an 0 83 26
innocent 1 83 26
homeowner, 0 83 26
rest 0 83 26
assured 0 83 26
that 0 83 26
they 0 83 26
would 0 83 26
be 0 83 26
in 0 83 26
jail—right 0 83 26
now. 0 83 26

However, 0 83 27
instead 0 83 27
of 0 83 27
immediately 0 83 27
arresting 0 83 27
the 0 83 27
officer 0 83 27
for 0 83 27
trespassing 0 83 27
and 0 83 27
murder, 0 83 27
she 0 83 27
was 0 83 27
simply 0 83 27
placed 0 83 27
on 0 83 27
administrative 0 83 27
leave—a 0 83 27
glaring 1 83 27
function 0 83 27
of 0 83 27
blue 1 83 27
privilege 1 83 27
indeed. 0 83 27

“Super 1 83 28
scary 1 83 28
because 0 83 28
the 0 83 28
police 0 83 28
are 0 83 28
supposed 0 83 28
to 0 83 28
protect 0 83 28
you 0 83 28
and 0 83 28
then 0 83 28
they 0 83 28
come 0 83 28
home 0 83 28
and, 0 83 28
you 0 83 28
know, 0 83 28
you’re 0 83 28
just 0 83 28
hanging 0 83 28
out 0 83 28
in 0 83 28
your 0 83 28
own 0 83 28
house 0 83 28

then 0 83 28
they 0 83 28
come 0 83 28
home 0 83 28
thinking 0 83 28
they’re 0 83 28
home 0 83 28

whatever. 0 83 28

I 0 83 29
don’t 0 83 29
know 0 83 29
if 0 83 29
she 0 83 29
was 0 83 29
tired 0 83 29
but 0 83 29
that’s 0 83 29

this 0 83 32
is 0 83 32
the 0 83 32
first 0 83 32
time 0 83 32
we’ve 0 83 32
reported 0 83 32

However, 0 83 34
what 0 83 34
is 0 83 34
entirely 0 83 34
clear 0 83 34
is 0 83 34
the 0 83 34
fact 0 83 34
that 0 83 34
