Wait! 0 16 1

It’s 0 16 2
all 0 16 2
a 0 16 2
MISTRANSLATION! 0 16 2

Thus, 0 16 3
it 0 16 3
took 0 16 3
more 0 16 3
than 0 16 3
a 0 16 3
year-and-a-half 0 16 3

defense 0 16 3
to 0 16 3
explain 0 16 3
away 0 16 3

infamous 0 16 3
paragraph 0 16 3

of 0 16 3
Amoris 0 16 3

Yet 0 16 4
conscience 0 16 4
can 0 16 4
do 0 16 4
more 0 16 4
than 0 16 4
recognize 0 16 4
that 0 16 4
a 0 16 4

situation 0 16 4
does 0 16 4
not 0 16 4
correspond 0 16 4

to 0 16 4
the 0 16 4
overall 0 16 4
demands 0 16 4
of 0 16 4
the 0 16 4
Gospel. 0 16 4

It 0 16 5
can 0 16 5
also 0 16 5
recognize 0 16 5
with 0 16 5
sincerity 0 16 5
and 0 16 5
honesty 0 16 5
what 0 16 5
for 0 16 5
now 0 16 5
is 0 16 5
the 0 16 5
most 0 16 5
generous 0 16 5
response 0 16 5
which 0 16 5
can 0 16 5
be 0 16 5
given 0 16 5
to 0 16 5
God, 0 16 5
and 0 16 5
come 0 16 5
to 0 16 5
see 0 16 5
with 0 16 5
a 0 16 5
certain 0 16 5
moral 0 16 5
security 0 16 5
that 0 16 5
it 0 16 5
is 0 16 5
what 0 16 5
God 0 16 5
himself 0 16 5
is 0 16 5
asking 0 16 5
amid 0 16 5
the 0 16 5
concrete 0 16 5
complexity 0 16 5
of 0 16 5
one’s 0 16 5
limits, 0 16 5
while 0 16 5
yet 0 16 5
not 0 16 5
fully 0 16 5
the 0 16 5
objective 0 16 5
ideal. 0 16 5

In 0 16 6
other 0 16 6
words, 0 16 6
the 0 16 6
conscience 0 16 6
can 0 16 6
“inform” 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
sinner 0 16 6
that 0 16 6
his 0 16 6
continued 0 16 6
sinning 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
not 0 16 6
only 0 16 6
acceptable 0 16 6
to 0 16 6
God 0 16 6
but 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
even 0 16 6
what 0 16 6
God 0 16 6
is 0 16 6
asking 0 16 6
“for 0 16 6
now,” 0 16 6
given 0 16 6
one’s 0 16 6
particular 0 16 6
“limits.” 0 16 6
This 0 16 6
outrageous 0 16 6
proposition, 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
form 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
situation 0 16 6
ethics 0 16 6
that 0 16 6
strikes 0 16 6
at 0 16 6
the 0 16 6
very 0 16 6
foundation 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
Catholic 0 16 6
moral 0 16 6
teaching, 0 16 6
has 0 16 6
justly 0 16 6
provoked 0 16 6
a 0 16 6
storm 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
criticism 0 16 6
from 0 16 6
lay 0 16 6
and 0 16 6
clerical 0 16 6
defenders 0 16 6
of 0 16 6
the 0 16 6
authentic 0 16 6

But 0 16 7
it’s 0 16 7
all 0 16 7
a 0 16 7

Yes, 0 16 16
and 0 16 16
so 0 16 16
what? 0 16 16

Well, 0 16 17
according 0 16 17
to 0 16 17
Fastiggi 0 16 17
and 0 16 17
Goldstein, 0 16 17
while 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
English 0 16 17
translation 0 16 17
reads: 0 16 17
“what 0 16 17
for 0 16 17
now 0 16 17
is 0 16 17
the 0 16 17

which 0 16 17

the 0 16 17
Latin 0 16 17
employs 0 16 17
the 0 16 17
word 0 16 17
oblationem, 0 16 17
which 0 16 17
means 0 16 17
offering. 0 16 17

So, 0 16 18
What 0 16 18
the 0 16 18
Pope 0 16 18
Really 0 16 18
Means® 0 16 18
is: 0 16 18
“what 0 16 18

can 0 16 18
be 0 16 18
given 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God.” 0 16 18
So, 0 16 18
it’s 0 16 18
an 0 16 18
offering 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God, 0 16 18
not 0 16 18
a 0 16 18
response 0 16 18
to 0 16 18
God. 0 16 18

Big 0 16 19
difference. 0 16 19

But 0 16 20
just 0 16 20
a 0 16 20
moment: 0 16 20
how 0 16 20
can 0 16 20
objectively 0 16 20
immoral 0 16 20
behavior 0 16 20
ever 0 16 20
be 0 16 20
characterized 0 16 20
as 0 16 20
an 0 16 20
“offering” 0 16 20
to 0 16 20
God? 0 16 20

It 0 16 21
would 0 16 21
seem 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
Latin 0 16 21
version 0 16 21
has 0 16 21
graver 0 16 21
implications 0 16 21
than 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
English 0 16 21
because 0 16 21
it 0 16 21
suggests 0 16 21
that 0 16 21
falling 0 16 21
short 0 16 21
of 0 16 21
what 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
moral 0 16 21
law 0 16 21
requires 0 16 21
is 0 16 21
an 0 16 21
oblation 0 16 21
pleasing 0 16 21
to 0 16 21
God 0 16 21
if 0 16 21
one’s 0 16 21
“limits” 0 16 21
make 0 16 21
obedience 0 16 21
to 0 16 21
the 0 16 21
moral 0 16 21
law 0 16 21
difficult. 0 16 21

And 1 16 22
that 1 16 22
is 1 16 22
exactly 1 16 22
the 1 16 22
nonsense 1 16 22
Fastiggi 1 16 22
and 1 16 22
Goldstein 1 16 22
expect 1 16 22
us 1 16 22
to 1 16 22
swallow: 1 16 22
“Pope 0 16 22
Francis 0 16 22
is 0 16 22
not 0 16 22
talking 0 16 22
about 0 16 22
an 0 16 22
offering 0 16 22
of 0 16 22
an 0 16 22
objectively 0 16 22
sinful 0 16 22
action 0 16 22
but 0 16 22
a 0 16 22
gift 0 16 22
of 0 16 22
self 0 16 22
that 0 16 22
moves 0 16 22
toward 0 16 22
God 0 16 22
and 0 16 22
the 0 16 22
objective 0 16 22
moral 0 16 22
norm.” 0 16 22

So, 0 16 23
our 1 16 23
intrepid 1 16 23
presenters 1 16 23
of 0 16 23
What 0 16 23
the 0 16 23
Pope 0 16 23
Really 0 16 23
Means® 0 16 23
would 0 16 23
have 0 16 23
us 0 16 23
believe 0 16 23
that 0 16 23
objectively 0 16 23
immoral 0 16 23
behavior, 0 16 23
which 0 16 23
is 0 16 23
the 0 16 23
best 0 16 23
one 0 16 23
can 0 16 23
do 0 16 23
according 0 16 23
“the 0 16 23
“concrete 0 16 23
complexity 0 16 23
of 0 16 23
one’s 0 16 23
limits,” 0 16 23
is 0 16 23
no 0 16 23
longer 0 16 23
simply 0 16 23
objectively 0 16 23
immoral 0 16 23
behavior 0 16 23
but 0 16 23
rather 0 16 23
a 0 16 23
gift 0 16 23
of 0 16 23
self 0 16 23
because 0 16 23
it 0 16 23
moves 0 16 23
toward 0 16 23
morally 0 16 23
licit 0 16 23
behavior. 0 16 23

Fastiggi 0 16 24
and 0 16 24
Goldstein 0 16 24
have 0 16 24
managed 0 16 24
to 0 16 24
make 0 16 24
the 0 16 24
problem 0 16 24
even 0 16 24
worse 0 16 24
in 0 16 24
their 0 16 24
attempt 0 16 24
to 0 16 24
explain 0 16 24
it 0 16 24
away. 0 16 24

What 0 16 25
about 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
English 0 16 25
locution 0 16 25
“while 0 16 25
yet 0 16 25
not 0 16 25
fully 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
objective 0 16 25
ideal,” 0 16 25
which 0 16 25
seems 0 16 25
to 0 16 25
reduce 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
negative 0 16 25
precepts 0 16 25
of 0 16 25
the 0 16 25
natural 0 16 25
law 0 16 25
to 0 16 25
mere 0 16 25
ideals? 0 16 25

Not 0 16 26
so, 0 16 26
Fastiggi 0 16 26
and 0 16 26
Goldstein 0 16 26
contend. 0 16 26

Do 0 16 27
not 0 16 27
all 1 16 27
those 1 16 27
ignorant 1 16 27
critics 1 16 27
of 1 16 27
AL 1 16 27
know 0 16 27
that 0 16 27
the 0 16 27
Latin 0 16 27
text 0 16 27
employs 0 16 27
the 0 16 27
phrase 0 16 27
“obiectivum 0 16 27
exemplar,” 0 16 27
which, 0 16 27
translated 0 16 27
literally 0 16 27
into 0 16 27
English 0 16 27
is 0 16 27
“objective 0 16 27
exemplar.” 0 16 27
They 0 16 27
declare 0 16 27
triumphantly: 0 16 27
“The 0 16 27
Latin 0 16 27
term 0 16 27
exemplar 0 16 27
does 0 16 27
not 0 16 27
mean 0 16 27
an 0 16 27
unattainable 0 16 27
ideal, 0 16 27
it 0 16 27
specifically 0 16 27
means 0 16 27
a 0 16 27
pattern 0 16 27
or 0 16 27
model 0 16 27
to 0 16 27
follow.” 0 16 27

Give. 0 16 28

Me. 0 16 29

A. 0 16 30

Break. 0 16 31

A 0 16 32
pattern 0 16 32
or 0 16 32
model 0 16 32
to 0 16 32
follow 0 16 32
is 0 16 32
an 0 16 32
ideal, 0 16 32
as 0 16 32
a 0 16 32
standard 0 16 32
Latin 0 16 32
dictionary 0 16 32
confirms 0 16 32
with 0 16 32
its 0 16 32
definition 0 16 32
of 0 16 32
exemplar: 0 16 32
“(1) 0 16 32
copy/reproduction, 0 16 32
(2) 0 16 32
model, 0 16 32
pattern, 0 16 32
example, 0 16 32
original, 0 16 32
ideal. 0 16 32

Likewise, 0 16 33
the 0 16 33
definition 0 16 33
of 0 16 33
the 0 16 33
English 0 16 33
word 0 16 33
“exemplar” 0 16 33
is 0 16 33
simply: 0 16 33
“an 0 16 33
ideal 0 16 33
model.” 0 16 33

Here 0 16 34
too 0 16 34
Fastiggi 0 16 34
and 0 16 34
Goldsetein 0 16 34
only 0 16 34
worsen 0 16 34
the 0 16 34
problem 0 16 34
they 0 16 34
try 0 16 34
to 0 16 34
explain 0 16 34

away. 0 16 35
For 0 16 35
if 0 16 35
moral 0 16 35
behavior 0 16 35
is 0 16 35
now 0 16 35
to 0 16 35
be 0 16 35
viewed 0 16 35
as 0 16 35
merely 0 16 35
“exemplary” 0 16 35
rather 0 16 35
than 0 16 35
divinely 0 16 35
mandated 0 16 35
by 0 16 35
the 0 16 35
natural 0 16 35
law 0 16 35
that 0 16 35
binds 0 16 35
all 0 16 35
men—including 0 16 35
Thou 0 16 35
Shalt 0 16 35
Not 0 16 35
Commit 0 16 35
Adultery—then 0 16 35
basic 0 16 35
morality 0 16 35
becomes 0 16 35
a 0 16 35
kind 0 16 35
of 0 16 35
heroic 0 16 35
virtue. 0 16 35

Thus, 0 16 36
continence 0 16 36
cannot 0 16 36
realistically 0 16 36
be 0 16 36
expected, 0 16 36
at 0 16 36
least 0 16 36
“for 0 16 36
now” 0 16 36
(AL 0 16 36
303), 0 16 36
of 0 16 36
the 0 16 36
average 0 16 36
Joe 0 16 36
or 0 16 36
Jane 0 16 36
with 0 16 36
an 0 16 36
“ex” 0 16 36
who 0 16 36
has 0 16 36
“remarried” 0 16 36
and 0 16 36
is 0 16 36
now 0 16 36
mired 0 16 36
in 0 16 36
the 0 16 36
“concrete 0 16 36
complexity 0 16 36
one’s 0 16 36
limits.” 0 16 36

So, 0 16 37
as 0 16 37
Fastiggi 0 16 37
and 0 16 37
Goldstein 0 16 37
would 0 16 37
have 0 16 37
it, 0 16 37
all 1 16 37
the 1 16 37
tumult 1 16 37
triggered 1 16 37
by 1 16 37
AL 1 16 37
is 1 16 37
just 1 16 37
a 1 16 37
misunderstanding 1 16 37
caused 1 16 37
by 1 16 37
uninformed 1 16 37
people 1 16 37
who 1 16 37
haven’t 1 16 37
consulted 1 16 37
the 1 16 37
Latin 1 16 37
text—including 0 16 37
those 1 16 37
ignorant 1 16 37
Vatican 1 16 37
translators. 1 16 37

According 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
their 0 16 38
proposed 0 16 38
“alternate 0 16 38
translation” 0 16 38
into 0 16 38
English, 0 16 38
What 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
Pope 0 16 38
Really 0 16 38
Means® 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
that 0 16 38
objectively 0 16 38
immoral 0 16 38
behavior 0 16 38
one 0 16 38
feels 0 16 38
unable 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
correct 0 16 38
due 0 16 38
to 0 16 38
one’s 0 16 38
“limits” 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
“the 0 16 38
offering 0 16 38
that 0 16 38
God 0 16 38
himself 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
asking 0 16 38
amid 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
mass 0 16 38
of 0 16 38
impediments, 0 16 38
although 0 16 38
it 0 16 38
may 0 16 38
not 0 16 38
yet 0 16 38
be 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
perfect 0 16 38
objective 0 16 38
model.” 0 16 38
Which 0 16 38
is 0 16 38
what 0 16 38
the 0 16 38
official 0 16 38
English 0 16 38
translation 0 16 38
already 0 16 38
says 0 16 38
but 0 16 38
with 0 16 38
fewer 0 16 38

words. 0 16 39
It 0 16 39
seems 0 16 39
Fastiggi 0 16 39
and 0 16 39
Goldstein 0 16 39
are 0 16 39
hoping 0 16 39
no 0 16 39
one 0 16 39
will 0 16 39
notice 0 16 39
that 0 16 39
their 0 16 39
linguistic 0 16 39
tinkering 0 16 39
produces 0 16 39
no 0 16 39
real 0 16 39
change 0 16 39
in 0 16 39
meaning 0 16 39
but 0 16 39
only 0 16 39
an 0 16 39
intensification 0 16 39
of 0 16 39
its 0 16 39
perniciousness. 0 16 39

Indeed, 0 16 40
their 0 16 40
“proposed 0 16 40
alternate 0 16 40
translation” 0 16 40
reduces 0 16 40
the 0 16 40
avoidance 0 16 40
of 0 16 40
adulterous 0 16 40
relations 0 16 40
in 0 16 40
“second 0 16 40
marriages” 0 16 40
to 0 16 40
the 0 16 40
“perfect 0 16 40
objective 0 16 40
model.” 0 16 40
Now, 0 16 40
how 0 16 40
could 0 16 40
anyone 0 16 40
but 0 16 40
a 0 16 40
Pharisee 0 16 40
expect 0 16 40
perfection 0 16 40
from 0 16 40
people 0 16 40
living 0 16 40
in 0 16 40
adultery? 0 16 40

Are 0 16 41
you 0 16 41

perfect? 0 16 42
Then 0 16 42
again, 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
Pharisees 0 16 42
are 0 16 42
precisely 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
ones 0 16 42
Our 0 16 42
Lord 0 16 42
condemned 0 16 42
for 0 16 42
accommodating 0 16 42
divorce 0 16 42
and 0 16 42
remarriage 0 16 42
in 0 16 42
violation 0 16 42
of 0 16 42
the 0 16 42
natural 0 16 42

law. 0 16 43
But 1 16 43
such 1 16 43
embarrassing 1 16 43
truths 1 16 43
need 1 16 43
not 1 16 43
impede 1 16 43
the 1 16 43
Bergoglian 1 16 43
Mercy 1 16 43
Train 1 16 43
as 1 16 43
it 1 16 43
barrels 1 16 43
toward 1 16 43
a 1 16 43
train 1 16 43
wreck 1 16 43
at 1 16 43
the 1 16 43
end 1 16 43
of 1 16 43
the 1 16 43

line. 1 16 44
And 0 16 44
Fastiggi 0 16 44
and 0 16 44
Goldstein 0 16 44
are 0 16 44
busily 0 16 44
helping 0 16 44
it 0 16 44
along, 0 16 44
changing 0 16 44
red 0 16 44
signals 0 16 44
to 0 16 44

green. 0 16 45
No 0 16 45
problem 0 16 45

here! 0 16 46
has 0 16 46
been 0 16 46
the 0 16 46
mantra 0 16 46
of 0 16 46
the 0 16 46
neo-Catholic 0 16 46
establishment 0 16 46
for 0 16 46
nearly 0 16 46
half 0 16 46
a 0 16 46
century 0 16 46
of 0 16 46
ecclesial 0 16 46
auto-demolition. 0 16 46

But 1 16 47
wait, 1 16 47
there’s 1 16 47

more! 1 16 48
Our 1 16 48
dynamic 1 16 48
translators 1 16 48
even 0 16 48
provide 0 16 48
their 0 16 48
own 0 16 48
dynamic 0 16 48
interpretation 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
AL 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
mean 0 16 48
that 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
“offering” 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
God 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
Francis 0 16 48
speaks 0 16 48
is 0 16 48
merely 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
decision 0 16 48
by 0 16 48
a 0 16 48
divorced 0 16 48
and 0 16 48
“remarried” 0 16 48
couple 0 16 48
with 0 16 48
children 0 16 48
not 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
end 0 16 48
their 0 16 48
relationship, 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
would 0 16 48
be 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
“perfect 0 16 48
objective 0 16 48
model,” 0 16 48
but 0 16 48
rather 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
“live 0 16 48
in 0 16 48
continence 0 16 48
until 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
may—after 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
hoped 0 16 48
for 0 16 48
declaration 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
nullity—enter 0 16 48
into 0 16 48
a 0 16 48
true 0 16 48
marriage.” 0 16 48
That 0 16 48
is, 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
would 0 16 48
have 0 16 48
Francis 0 16 48
affirming 0 16 48
John 0 16 48
Paul 0 16 48
II’s 0 16 48
Familiaris 0 16 48
consortio, 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
repeats 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
Church’s 0 16 48
constant 0 16 48
teaching 0 16 48
that 0 16 48
continence 0 16 48
is 0 16 48
required 0 16 48
of 0 16 48
those 0 16 48
who 0 16 48
have 0 16 48
entered 0 16 48
into 0 16 48
adulterous 0 16 48
“second 0 16 48
marriage,” 0 16 48
failing 0 16 48
which 0 16 48
they 0 16 48
cannot 0 16 48
be 0 16 48
admitted 0 16 48
to 0 16 48
the 0 16 48
sacraments. 0 16 48

But 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
Fastiggi-Goldstein 0 16 49
interpretation 0 16 49
is 0 16 49
precisely 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
contrary 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
interpretation 0 16 49
Francis 0 16 49
has 0 16 49
assiduously 0 16 49
promoted 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
which 0 16 49
Fastiggi 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
Goldstein 0 16 49
just 0 16 49
as 0 16 49
assiduously 0 16 49
ignore: 0 16 49
i.e., 0 16 49
that 0 16 49
people 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
“second 0 16 49
marriages” 0 16 49
do 0 16 49
not 0 16 49
have 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
live 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
continence, 0 16 49
but 0 16 49
rather—in 0 16 49
“certain 0 16 49
cases”—may 0 16 49
continue 0 16 49
their 0 16 49
adulterous 0 16 49
relations 0 16 49
while 0 16 49
receiving 0 16 49
absolution 0 16 49
and 0 16 49
Holy 0 16 49
Communion 0 16 49
during 0 16 49
a 0 16 49
“process 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
discernment.” 0 16 49
As 0 16 49
we 0 16 49
know, 0 16 49
in 0 16 49
his 0 16 49
letter 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
bishops 0 16 49
of 0 16 49
Buenos 0 16 49
Aires, 0 16 49
published 0 16 49
on 0 16 49
the 0 16 49
Vatican 0 16 49
website 0 16 49
(in 0 16 49
response 0 16 49
to 0 16 49
a 0 16 49
query 0 16 49
he 0 16 49
himself 0 16 49
may 0 16 49
have 0 16 49

Bergoglio 0 16 49
informed 0 16 49
them 0 16 49
“there 0 16 49
is 0 16 49
no 0 16 49

Moreover, 0 16 50
the 0 16 50

thus: 0 16 51
If, 0 16 51
as 0 16 51
a 0 16 51
result 0 16 51
of 0 16 51
the 0 16 51
process 0 16 51
of 0 16 51

with 0 16 51
“humility, 0 16 51

(AL 0 16 51

with 0 16 51
an 0 16 51

enlightened 0 16 51
conscience, 0 16 51

and 0 16 52

This 0 16 52
Pope’s 0 16 52
plan 0 16 52
of 0 16 52
promulgating 0 16 52
a 0 16 52
deliberately 0 16 52
ambiguous 0 16 52
document 0 16 52
whose 0 16 52
heterodox 0 16 52
interpretation 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
application 0 16 52
he 0 16 52
would 0 16 52
later 0 16 52
approve 0 16 52
with 0 16 52
a 0 16 52
series 0 16 52
of 0 16 52
sub-magisterial 0 16 52
winks 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
nods, 0 16 52
both 0 16 52
oral 0 16 52
and 0 16 52
written, 0 16 52
is 0 16 52
the 0 16 52
reason 0 16 52
I 0 16 52
signed 0 16 52
onto 0 16 52
the 0 16 52
Correctio 0 16 52

Filialis. 0 16 53
See 0 16 53
the 0 16 53
piece 0 16 53
by 0 16 53
Joseph 0 16 53
Shaw 0 16 53
in 0 16 53
this 0 16 53

regard. 0 16 54
Shaw 0 16 54
maintains 0 16 54
that 0 16 54
AL 0 16 54
can 0 16 54
be 0 16 54
“bent 0 16 54
into 0 16 54
some 0 16 54
kind 0 16 54
of 0 16 54
orthodoxy.” 0 16 54

Perhaps. 0 16 55
But 0 16 55
it 0 16 55
is 0 16 55
not 0 16 55
our 0 16 55
responsibility 0 16 55
to 0 16 55
bend 0 16 55
a 0 16 55
Pope’s 0 16 55
statements 0 16 55
into 0 16 55
conformity 0 16 55
with 0 16 55

the 0 16 56
Faith. 0 16 56
Moreover, 0 16 56
any 0 16 56
Pope 0 16 56
who 0 16 56
promulgates 0 16 56
a 0 16 56
document 0 16 56
that 0 16 56
can 0 16 56
be 0 16 56
read 0 16 56
as 0 16 56
orthodox 0 16 56
only 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
a 0 16 56
forced 0 16 56
interpretation 0 16 56
imposed 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
certain 0 16 56
readers—while 0 16 56
others 0 16 56
disagree—has 0 16 56
by 0 16 56
that 0 16 56
very 0 16 56
fact 0 16 56
inflicted 0 16 56
grave 0 16 56
harm 0 16 56
upon 0 16 56
on 0 16 56
the 0 16 56
Church, 0 16 56
which 0 16 56
he 0 16 56
alone 0 16 56
has 0 16 56
the 0 16 56
duty 0 16 56

to 0 16 57
correct. 0 16 57
But 0 16 57
Francis, 0 16 57
as 0 16 57
any 0 16 57
reasonable 0 16 57
observer 0 16 57
can 0 16 57
see, 0 16 57
has 0 16 57
no 0 16 57
intention 0 16 57
of 0 16 57
offering 0 16 57
any 0 16 57
such 0 16 57

correction. 0 16 58
Quite 0 16 58
to 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
contrary, 0 16 58
confusion 0 16 58
as 0 16 58
a 0 16 58
cover 0 16 58
for 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
introduction 0 16 58
of 0 16 58
Holy 0 16 58
Communion 0 16 58
for 1 16 58
“certain” 1 16 58
public 1 16 58
adulterers 1 16 58
by 0 16 58
Bergoglio’s 0 16 58
co-conspirators 0 16 58
in 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
Vatican 0 16 58
and 0 16 58
various 0 16 58
dioceses 0 16 58
is 0 16 58
exactly 0 16 58
what 0 16 58
he 0 16 58
was 0 16 58
aiming 0 16 58
to 0 16 58
achieve 0 16 58
from 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
beginning 0 16 58
of 0 16 58
the 0 16 58
whole 0 16 58
synodal 1 16 58
charade, 1 16 58
which 0 16 58
was 0 16 58
merely 0 16 58
a 0 16 58
vehicle 0 16 58
for 0 16 58
promulgation 0 16 58

of 0 16 59
AL. 0 16 59
As 0 16 59
Shaw 0 16 59
observes 0 16 59
of 0 16 59
AL: 0 16 59
“What 0 16 59
we 0 16 59
[the 0 16 59
signers 0 16 59
of 0 16 59
the 0 16 59
Correctio] 0 16 59
are 0 16 59
saying 0 16 59
is 0 16 59
that 0 16 59
it 0 16 59
has 0 16 59
become 0 16 59
clear 0 16 59
that 0 16 59
orthodoxy 0 16 59
is 0 16 59
not 0 16 59
what 0 16 59
Pope 0 16 59
Francis 0 16 59
wants 0 16 59
us 0 16 59
to 0 16 59

find 0 16 60
there.” 0 16 60
In 1 16 60
a 1 16 60
sense, 1 16 60
what 1 16 60
Bergoglio 1 16 60
is 1 16 60
doing 1 16 60
is 1 16 60
worse 1 16 60
than 1 16 60
explicit 1 16 60
heresy, 1 16 60
which 0 16 60
could 0 16 60
at 0 16 60
least 0 16 60
be 0 16 60
readily 0 16 60
identified 0 16 60
and 0 16 60
denounced 0 16 60

as 0 16 61
such. 0 16 61
But 0 16 61
Bergoglio 0 16 61
wants 0 16 61
the 0 16 61
effects 0 16 61
of 0 16 61
heresy—undermining 0 16 61
Holy 0 16 61
Matrimony, 0 16 61
Confession 0 16 61
and 0 16 61
Holy 0 16 61
Communion, 0 16 61
whose 0 16 61
integrity 0 16 61
is 0 16 61
affirmed 0 16 61
verbally—without 0 16 61
the 0 16 61
guilt 0 16 61
of 0 16 61
an 0 16 61
explicit 0 16 61

promulgation. 0 16 62
In 0 16 62
so 0 16 62
acting, 0 16 62
he 0 16 62
is 0 16 62
very 0 16 62
much 0 16 62
in 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
mold 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
Honorius 0 16 62
I, 0 16 62
who 0 16 62
was 0 16 62
posthumously 0 16 62
anathematized 0 16 62
by 0 16 62
an 0 16 62
ecumenical 0 16 62
council 0 16 62
(the 0 16 62
Third 0 16 62
Council 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
Constantinople) 0 16 62
and 0 16 62
by 0 16 62
his 0 16 62
own 0 16 62
successor 0 16 62
(Leo 0 16 62
II) 0 16 62
for 0 16 62
aiding 0 16 62
and 0 16 62
abetting 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
spread 0 16 62
of 0 16 62
the 0 16 62
Monothelite 0 16 62
heresy 0 16 62
(no 0 16 62
human 0 16 62
but 0 16 62
only 0 16 62
a 0 16 62
divine 0 16 62
will 0 16 62

in 0 16 63
Christ). 0 16 63
Honorius 0 16 63
did 0 16 63
so 0 16 63
by 0 16 63
means 0 16 63
of 0 16 63
private 0 16 63
correspondence 0 16 63
with 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
author 0 16 63
of 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
heresy, 0 16 63
endorsing 0 16 63
the 0 16 63
heresy 0 16 63
without 0 16 63
ever 0 16 63
formally 0 16 63
proclaiming 0 16 63
it 0 16 63

as 0 16 64
doctrine. 0 16 64
And 0 16 64
yet 0 16 64
Honorius 0 16 64
I 0 16 64
is 0 16 64
listed 0 16 64
in 0 16 64
the 0 16 64
canon 0 16 64
of 0 16 64
the 0 16 64
Popes 0 16 64
and 0 16 64
is 0 16 64
not 0 16 64
considered 0 16 64
to 0 16 64
have 0 16 64
fallen 0 16 64
from 0 16 64
office 0 16 64
on 0 16 64
account 0 16 64

of 0 16 65
heresy. 0 16 65
A 0 16 65
similar 0 16 65
judgment 0 16 65
might 0 16 65
well 0 16 65
befall 0 16 65
this 0 16 65
Pope, 0 16 65
but 0 16 65
it 0 16 65
is 0 16 65
not 0 16 65
for 0 16 65
us 0 16 65

to 0 16 66
level 0 16 66
it. 0 16 66
Meanwhile, 0 16 66
as 0 16 66
Fastiggi 0 16 66
and 0 16 66
Goldstein 0 16 66
labor 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
convince 0 16 66
us 0 16 66
that 0 16 66
nothing 0 16 66
is 0 16 66
amiss 0 16 66
with 0 16 66
AL, 0 16 66
Pope 0 16 66
Bergoglio 0 16 66
is 0 16 66
sending 0 16 66
clear 0 16 66
signals 0 16 66
of 0 16 66
concern 0 16 66
about 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
rising 0 16 66
opposition 0 16 66
among 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
faithful 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
his 0 16 66
master 0 16 66
plan 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
subvert 0 16 66
the 0 16 66
Church 0 16 66
according 0 16 66
to 0 16 66
his 0 16 66
false 0 16 66
notion 0 16 66

of 0 16 67
mercy. 0 16 67
In 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
classic 0 16 67
power 0 16 67
move, 0 16 67
he 0 16 67
has 0 16 67
just 0 16 67
given 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
sop 0 16 67
to 0 16 67
Cardinal 0 16 67
Burke, 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
perceived 0 16 67
leader 0 16 67
of 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
opposition, 0 16 67
by 0 16 67
appointing 0 16 67
him 0 16 67
to 0 16 67
a 0 16 67
minor 0 16 67
position 0 16 67
on 0 16 67
the 0 16 67
Apostolic 0 16 67
Signatura—the 0 16 67
same 0 16 67
tribunal 0 16 67
from 0 16 67
which 0 16 67
Bergoglio 0 16 67
brutally 0 16 67
removed 0 16 67
him 0 16 67

as 0 16 68
Prefect. 0 16 68
And 0 16 68
this 0 16 68
after 0 16 68
also 0 16 68
humiliating 0 16 68
Burke 0 16 68
as 0 16 68
the 0 16 68
spiritual 0 16 68
patron 0 16 68
of 0 16 68
the 0 16 68
Knights 0 16 68
of 0 16 68
Malta, 0 16 68
to 0 16 68
which 0 16 68
he 0 16 68
was 0 16 68
exiled 0 16 68
after 0 16 68

his 0 16 69
removal. 0 16 69
Will 0 16 69
this 0 16 69
sop 0 16 69
buy 0 16 69
Burke’s 0 16 69
silence, 0 16 69
staving 0 16 69
off 0 16 69
the 0 16 69
feared 0 16 69
public 0 16 69

correction? 0 16 70
We 0 16 70
will 0 16 70
soon 0 16 70
know 0 16 70
if 0 16 70
the 0 16 70
Cardinal 0 16 70
can 0 16 70
be 0 16 70
bought 0 16 70

so 0 16 71
easily. 0 16 71
But 0 16 71
this 0 16 71
move 0 16 71
demonstrates—if 0 16 71
more 0 16 71
evidence 0 16 71
were 0 16 71
needed—that 0 16 71
Bergoglio 0 16 71
has 0 16 71
never 0 16 71
been 0 16 71
the 1 16 71
humble 1 16 71
apostle 1 16 71
of 1 16 71
mercy 1 16 71
depicted 1 16 71
in 1 16 71
his 1 16 71
carefully 1 16 71
crafted 1 16 71
public 1 16 71
relations 1 16 71
narrative, 1 16 71
but 1 16 71
rather 1 16 71
a 1 16 71
cunning 1 16 71
ecclesiastical 1 16 71
politician, 1 16 71
constantly 1 16 71
plotting 1 16 71
and 1 16 71
scheming 1 16 71
to 1 16 71
get 1 16 71

what 1 16 71

he 1 16 71

wants. 1 16 71

That 0 16 71

the 0 16 71

neo-Catholic 0 16 71

establishment 0 16 71

refuses 0 16 71

to 0 16 71

recognize 0 16 71

the 1 16 71

grim 1 16 71

reality 1 16 71

of 1 16 71

this 1 16 71

unprecedented 1 16 71

pontificate 1 16 71

is 0 16 71

but 0 16 71

another 0 16 71

page 0 16 71

in 0 16 71

the 0 16 71

long 0 16 71

annals 0 16 71

of 0 16 71

its 0 16 71

shameful 0 16 71

defense 0 16 71

of 0 16 71

the 0 16 71

indefensible 0 16 71

to 0 16 71

the 0 16 71

detriment 0 16 71

of 0 16 71

Holy 0 16 71

Mother 0 16 71

Church. 0 16 71
