The 0 39 1
Kurds 0 39 1
have 0 39 1
no 0 39 1
friends 0 39 1
but 0 39 1
the 0 39 1
mountains, 0 39 1
is 0 39 1
an 0 39 1
old 0 39 1
lament 0 39 1
. 0 39 1

Last 0 39 2
week, 0 39 2
it 0 39 2
must 0 39 2
have 0 39 2
been 0 39 2
very 0 39 2
much 0 39 2
on 0 39 2
Kurdish 0 39 2
minds. 0 39 2

As 0 39 3
their 0 39 3
U.S. 0 39 3
allies 0 39 3
watched, 0 39 3
the 0 39 3
Kurdish 0 39 3
peshmerga 0 39 3
fighters 0 39 3
were 0 39 3
run 0 39 3
out 0 39 3
of 0 39 3
Kirkuk 0 39 3
and 0 39 3
all 0 39 3
the 0 39 3
territory 0 39 3
they 0 39 3
had 0 39 3
captured 0 39 3
fighting 0 39 3
ISIS 0 39 3
alongside 0 39 3
the 0 39 3
Americans. 0 39 3

The 0 39 4
Iraqi 0 39 4
army 0 39 4
that 0 39 4
ran 0 39 4
them 0 39 4
out 0 39 4
was 0 39 4
trained 0 39 4
and 0 39 4
armed 0 39 4
by 0 39 4
the 0 39 4
United 0 39 4

The 0 39 5
U.S. 0 39 5
had 0 39 5
warned 0 39 5
the 0 39 5
Kurds 0 39 5
against 0 39 5
holding 0 39 5
the 0 39 5
referendum 0 39 5
on 0 39 5
independence 0 39 5
on 0 39 5
Sept. 0 39 5
25, 0 39 5
which 0 39 5
carried 0 39 5
with 0 39 5
92 0 39 5
percent. 0 39 5

Iran 0 39 6
and 0 39 6
Turkey 0 39 6
had 0 39 6
warned 0 39 6
against 0 39 6
an 0 39 6
independent 0 39 6
Kurdistan 0 39 6
that 0 39 6
could 0 39 6
be 0 39 6
a 0 39 6
magnet 0 39 6
for 0 39 6
Kurdish 0 39 6
minorities 0 39 6
in 0 39 6
their 0 39 6
own 0 39 6
countries. 0 39 6

But 0 39 7
the 0 39 7
Iraqi 0 39 7
Kurds 0 39 7
went 0 39 7
ahead. 0 39 7

Now 0 39 8
they 0 39 8
have 0 39 8
lost 0 39 8
Kirkuk 0 39 8
and 0 39 8
its 0 39 8
oil, 0 39 8
and 0 39 8
their 1 39 8
dream 1 39 8
of 1 39 8
independence 1 39 8
is 1 39 8
all 1 39 8
but 1 39 8
dead. 1 39 8

More 0 39 9
troubling 0 39 9
for 0 39 9
America 0 39 9
is 0 39 9
the 0 39 9
new 0 39 9
reality 0 39 9
revealed 0 39 9
by 0 39 9
the 0 39 9
rout 0 39 9
of 0 39 9
the 0 39 9
peshmerga. 0 39 9

Iraq, 0 39 10
which 0 39 10
George 0 39 10
W. 0 39 10
Bush 0 39 10
and 0 39 10
the 0 39 10
neocons 0 39 10
were 0 39 10
going 0 39 10
to 0 39 10
fashion 0 39 10
into 0 39 10
a 0 39 10
pro-Western 0 39 10
democracy 0 39 10
and 0 39 10
American 0 39 10
ally, 0 39 10
appears 0 39 10
to 0 39 10
be 0 39 10
as 0 39 10
close 0 39 10
to 0 39 10
Iran 0 39 10
as 0 39 10
it 0 39 10
is 0 39 10
to 0 39 10
the 0 39 10
United 0 39 10
States. 0 39 10

After 0 39 11
4,500 0 39 11
U.S. 0 39 11
dead, 0 39 11
scores 0 39 11
of 0 39 11
thousands 0 39 11
wounded 0 39 11
and 0 39 11
a 0 39 11
trillion 0 39 11
dollars 0 39 11
sunk, 0 39 11
our 0 39 11
15-year 0 39 11
war 0 39 11
in 0 39 11
Iraq 0 39 11
could 0 39 11
end 0 39 11
with 0 39 11
a 0 39 11
Shiite-dominated 0 39 11
Baghdad 0 39 11
aligned 0 39 11
with 0 39 11
Tehran. 0 39 11

With 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
grim 0 39 12
prospect 0 39 12
in 0 39 12
mind, 0 39 12
Secretary 0 39 12
Rex 0 39 12
Tillerson 0 39 12
said 0 39 12
Sunday 0 39 12
, 0 39 12
"Iranian 0 39 12
militias 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
are 0 39 12
in 0 39 12
Iraq, 0 39 12
now 0 39 12
that 0 39 12
the 0 39 12
fight 0 39 12
against 0 39 12
... 0 39 12
ISIS 0 39 12

... 0 39 12
need 0 39 12
to 0 39 12

Any 0 39 13
foreign 0 39 13
fighters 0 39 13
in 0 39 13
Iraq 0 39 13
need 0 39 13
to 0 39 13
go 0 39 13
home." 0 39 13

Tillerson 0 39 14
meant 0 39 14
Iran's 0 39 14
Quds 0 39 14
Force 0 39 14
in 0 39 14
Iraq 0 39 14
should 0 39 14
go 0 39 14
home, 0 39 14
and 0 39 14
the 0 39 14
Shiite 0 39 14
militia 0 39 14
in 0 39 14
Iraq 0 39 14
should 0 39 14
be 0 39 14
conscripted 0 39 14
into 0 39 14
the 0 39 14
army. 0 39 14

But 1 39 15
what 1 39 15
if 1 39 15
the 1 39 15
Baghdad 1 39 15
regime 1 39 15
of 1 39 15
Haider 1 39 15
al-Abadi 1 39 15
does 1 39 15
not 1 39 15
agree? 1 39 15

What 1 39 16
if 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Quds 1 39 16
Force 1 39 16
does 1 39 16
not 1 39 16
go 1 39 16
home 1 39 16
to 1 39 16
Iran 1 39 16
and 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Shiite 1 39 16
militias 1 39 16
that 1 39 16
helped 1 39 16
retake 1 39 16
Kirkuk 1 39 16
refuse 1 39 16
to 1 39 16
enlist 1 39 16
in 1 39 16
the 1 39 16
Iraqi 1 39 16
army? 1 39 16

Who 0 39 17
then 0 39 17
enforces 0 39 17
Tillerson's 0 39 17
demands? 0 39 17

Consider 0 39 18
what 0 39 18
is 0 39 18
happening 0 39 18
in 0 39 18
Syria. 0 39 18

The 0 39 19
U.S.-backed 0 39 19
Syrian 0 39 19
Democratic 0 39 19
Forces, 0 39 19
largely 0 39 19
Kurdish, 0 39 19
just 0 39 19
annihilated 0 39 19
ISIS 0 39 19
in 0 39 19
Raqqa 0 39 19
and 0 39 19
drove 0 39 19
60 0 39 19
miles 0 39 19
to 0 39 19
seize 0 39 19
Syria's 0 39 19
largest 0 39 19
oil 0 39 19
field, 0 39 19
al-Omar, 0 39 19
from 0 39 19
ISIS. 0 39 19

The 0 39 20
race 0 39 20
is 0 39 20
now 0 39 20
on 0 39 20
between 0 39 20
the 0 39 20
SDF 0 39 20
and 0 39 20
Bashar 0 39 20
Assad's 0 39 20
army 0 39 20
to 0 39 20
secure 0 39 20
the 0 39 20
border 0 39 20
with 0 39 20
Iraq. 0 39 20

Bottom 0 39 21
line: 0 39 21
The 0 39 21
U.S. 0 39 21
goal 0 39 21
of 0 39 21
crushing 0 39 21
the 0 39 21
ISIS 0 39 21
caliphate 0 39 21
is 0 39 21
almost 0 39 21
attained. 0 39 21

But 0 39 22
if 0 39 22
our 0 39 22
victory 0 39 22
in 0 39 22
the 0 39 22
war 0 39 22
against 0 39 22
ISIS 0 39 22
leaves 0 39 22
Iran 0 39 22
in 0 39 22
the 0 39 22
catbird 0 39 22
seat 0 39 22
in 0 39 22
Baghdad 0 39 22
and 0 39 22
Damascus, 0 39 22
and 0 39 22
its 0 39 22
corridor 0 39 22
from 0 39 22
Tehran 0 39 22
to 0 39 22
Baghdad, 0 39 22
Damascus 0 39 22
and 0 39 22
Beirut 0 39 22
secure, 1 39 22
is 1 39 22
that 1 39 22
really 1 39 22
a 1 39 22
victory? 1 39 22

Do 1 39 23
we 1 39 23
accept 1 39 23
that 1 39 23
outcome, 1 39 23
pack 1 39 23
up 1 39 23
and 1 39 23
go 1 39 23
home? 1 39 23

Or 1 39 24
do 1 39 24
we 1 39 24
leave 1 39 24
our 1 39 24
forces 1 39 24
in 1 39 24
Syria 1 39 24
and 1 39 24
Iraq 1 39 24
and 1 39 24
defy 1 39 24
any 1 39 24
demand 1 39 24
from 1 39 24
Assad 1 39 24
to 1 39 24
vacate 1 39 24
his 1 39 24

Sunday's 0 39 25
editorial 0 39 25
in 0 39 25
The 0 39 25
Washington 0 39 25
Post, 0 39 25
"The 0 39 25
Next 0 39 25
Mideast 0 39 25
Wars," 0 39 25
raises 0 39 25
the 0 39 25
crucial 0 39 25
questions 0 39 25
now 0 39 25
before 0 39 25
us. 0 39 25

Would 0 39 26
President 0 39 26
Trump 0 39 26
be 0 39 26
willing 0 39 26
to 0 39 26
fight 0 39 26
a 0 39 26
new 0 39 26
war 0 39 26
to 0 39 26
keep 0 39 26
Iran 0 39 26
from 0 39 26
consolidating 0 39 26
its 0 39 26
position 0 39 26
in 0 39 26
Iraq 0 39 26
and 0 39 26
Syria? 0 39 26

Would 1 39 27
the 1 39 27
American 1 39 27
people 1 39 27
support 1 39 27
such 1 39 27
a 1 39 27
war 1 39 27
with 1 39 27
U.S. 1 39 27
troops? 1 39 27

Would 0 39 28
Congress, 0 39 28
apparently 1 39 28
clueless 1 39 28
to 1 39 28
the 1 39 28
presence 1 39 28
of 1 39 28
800 1 39 28
U.S. 1 39 28
troops 1 39 28
in 1 39 28
Niger, 1 39 28
authorize 0 39 28
a 0 39 28
new 0 39 28
U.S. 0 39 28
war 0 39 28
in 0 39 28
Syria 0 39 28
or 0 39 28
Iraq? 0 39 28

If 0 39 29
Trump 0 39 29
and 0 39 29
his 0 39 29
generals 0 39 29
felt 0 39 29
our 0 39 29
vital 0 39 29
interests 0 39 29
could 0 39 29
not 0 39 29
allow 0 39 29
Syria 0 39 29
and 0 39 29
Iraq 0 39 29
to 0 39 29
drift 0 39 29
into 0 39 29
the 0 39 29
orbit 0 39 29
of 0 39 29
Iran, 0 39 29
where 0 39 29
would 0 39 29
we 0 39 29
find 0 39 29
allies 0 39 29
for 0 39 29
such 0 39 29
a 0 39 29
fight? 0 39 29

If 1 39 30
we 1 39 30
rely 1 39 30
on 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
Kurds 1 39 30
in 1 39 30
Syria, 1 39 30
we 1 39 30
lose 1 39 30
NATO 1 39 30
ally 1 39 30
Turkey, 1 39 30
which 1 39 30
regards 1 39 30
Syria's 1 39 30
Kurds 1 39 30
as 1 39 30
collaborators 1 39 30
of 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
PKK 1 39 30
in 1 39 30
Turkey, 1 39 30
which 1 39 30
even 1 39 30
the 1 39 30
U.S. 1 39 30
designates 1 39 30
a 1 39 30
terrorist 1 39 30
organization. 1 39 30

The 0 39 31
decision 0 39 31
as 0 39 31
to 0 39 31
whether 0 39 31
this 0 39 31
country 0 39 31
should 0 39 31
engage 0 39 31
in 0 39 31
new 0 39 31
post-ISIS 0 39 31
wars 0 39 31
in 0 39 31
the 0 39 31
Mideast, 0 39 31
however, 0 39 31
may 0 39 31
be 0 39 31
taken 0 39 31
out 0 39 31
of 0 39 31
our 0 39 31
hands. 0 39 31

Saturday, 0 39 32
Israel 0 39 32
launched 0 39 32
new 0 39 32
air 0 39 32
strikes 0 39 32
against 0 39 32
gun 0 39 32
positions 0 39 32
in 0 39 32
Syria 0 39 32
in 0 39 32
retaliation 0 39 32
for 0 39 32
shells 0 39 32
fired 0 39 32
into 0 39 32
the 0 39 32
Golan 0 39 32
Heights. 0 39 32

Damascus 0 39 33
claims 0 39 33
that 0 39 33
Israel's 0 39 33
"terrorist" 1 39 33
allies 0 39 33
inside 0 39 33
Syria 0 39 33
fired 0 39 33
the 0 39 33
shells, 0 39 33
to 0 39 33
give 0 39 33
the 0 39 33
IDF 0 39 33
an 0 39 33
excuse 0 39 33
to 0 39 33
attack. 0 39 33

Why 0 39 34
would 0 39 34
Israel 0 39 34
wish 0 39 34
to 0 39 34
provoke 0 39 34
a 0 39 34
war 0 39 34
with 0 39 34
Syria? 0 39 34

Because 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
Israelis 0 39 35
see 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
outcome 0 39 35
of 0 39 35
the 0 39 35
six-year 0 39 35
Syrian 0 39 35
civil 0 39 35
war 0 39 35
as 0 39 35
a 0 39 35
strategic 0 39 35
disaster. 0 39 35

Hezbollah, 0 39 36
stronger 0 39 36
than 0 39 36
ever, 0 39 36
was 0 39 36
part 0 39 36
of 0 39 36
Assad's 0 39 36
victorious 0 39 36
coalition. 0 39 36

Iran 0 39 37
may 0 39 37
have 0 39 37
secured 0 39 37
its 0 39 37
land 0 39 37
corridor 0 39 37
from 0 39 37
Tehran 0 39 37
to 0 39 37
Beirut. 0 39 37

Its 0 39 38
presence 0 39 38
in 0 39 38
Syria 0 39 38
could 0 39 38
now 0 39 38
be 0 39 38
permanent. 0 39 38

And 1 39 39
only 1 39 39
one 1 39 39
force 1 39 39
in 1 39 39
the 1 39 39
region 1 39 39
has 1 39 39
the 1 39 39
power 1 39 39
to 1 39 39
reverse 1 39 39
the 1 39 39
present 1 39 39
outcome 1 39 39
of 1 39 39
Syria's 1 39 39
civil 1 39 39
war--the 1 39 39
United 1 39 39
States. 1 39 39

Bibi 0 39 40
Netanyahu 0 39 40
knows 0 39 40
that 0 39 40
if 0 39 40
war 0 39 40
with 0 39 40
Syria 0 39 40
breaks 0 39 40
out, 0 39 40
a 0 39 40
clamor 0 39 40
will 0 39 40
arise 0 39 40
in 0 39 40
Congress 0 39 40
to 0 39 40
have 0 39 40
the 0 39 40
U.S. 0 39 40
rush 0 39 40
