In 0

that 0
contradicts 0
the 0

story 0
surrounding 0
the 0

mass 0
shooting 0
in 0

history, 0

in 0

at 0

come 0
forward 0
to 0
reveal 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
an 0
active 0
shooter 0
inside 0
the 0
Bellagio 0
Hotel 0
around 0
the 0

that 0

During 0
the 0
confessional, 0
a 0
Canadian 0
man 0
by 0
the 0
name 0
of 0
Jeff 0
detailed 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
were 0
in 0
the 0
Bellagio 0
Resort 0
and 0
Casino 0
around 0
11:20pm 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
when 0
panic 0
broke 0
out 0
in 0
the 0
hotels 0
lobby. 0

Jeff 0
begins 0
the 0
interview 0
by 0
making 0
clear 0
his 0
belief 0
that 0
there 0
were 0
multiple 0
active 0
shooters 0
targeting 0
different 0
places 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
attack. 0

“First 0
of 0
all, 0
I 0
think 0
what 0
needs 0
to 0
be 0
said 0
is 0
that, 0
from 0
my 0
perspective, 0
there 0
were 0
multiple 0
events 0
that 0
occurred 0
around 0
Las 0
Vegas, 0
up 0
and 0
down 0
the 0
Strip 0
that 0
night. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
just 0
centralized 0
around 0
the 0
Mandalay 0
Hotel,” 0
the 0
witness 0
claimed. 0

The 0
eyewitness 0
then 0
goes 0
on 0
to 0
directly 0
say 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
active 0
shooter 0
situation 0
at 0
a 0
different 0
hotel 0
that 0
authorities 0
have 0
so 0
far 0
done 0
everything 0
in 0
their 0
power 0
to 0
cover-up. 0

“My 0
wife 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
in 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
celebrating 0
our 0
10th 0
anniversary 0
and 0
on 0
October 0
1st 0
we 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
an 0
incident 0
with 0
an 0
active 0
shooter 0
at 0
the 0
Bellagio. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
mistake 0
in 0
my 0
mind 0
about 0
it,” 0
he 0
continued. 0

Jeff 0
then 0
describes 0
a 0
scene 0
in 0
which 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
wife 0
were 0
walking 0
through 0
the 0
main 0
lobby 0
when 0
screams 0
and 0
gunfire 0
erupted. 0

Keep 1
in 1
mind, 1
this 1
is 1
all 1
information 1
that 1
the 1
police 1
and 1
the 1
FBI 1
has 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
American 1
people. 1

“All 0
of 0
a 0
sudden 0
there 0
was 0
just 0
a 0
crescendo 0
of 0
screams 0
that 0
started 0
behind 0
us 0
in 0
the 0
lobby,” 0
he 0
claimed. 0

“Then 0
I 0
heard 0
somebody 0
yell 0
‘there’s 0
a 0
shooter! 0

There’s 0
a 0
shooter!’ 0
And 0
then 0
I 0
heard 0
like 0
five 0
or 0
six 0
pops, 0
like 0
unmistakable 0
gunfire, 0
unmistakably.” 0

“That 0
was 0
about 0
11:20 0
when 0
we 0
heard 0
the 0
shots 0
and 0
the 0
screams… 0
at 0
that 0
point 0
you 0
could 0
hear 0
and 0
see 0
the 0
screams 0
and 0
see 0
hundreds 0
of 0
people 0
coming 0
towards 0
us.” 0

Amazingly, 0
as 0
Shepard 0
Ambellas 0
noted, 0
“The 0
man’s 0
claims 0
match 0
up 0
to 0
actual 0
events 0
captured 0
in 0
police 0
audio 0
recordings 0
from 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting 0
which 0
confirms 0
that 0
between 0
11:15 0
and 0
11:18 0
p.m. 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
Oct. 0
1 0
there 0
was, 0
in 0
fact, 0
something 0
going 0
on 0
at 0
the 0
Bellagio.” 0

This 0
testimony 0
also 0
backs 0
up 0
claims 0
by 0
another 0
eyewitness, 0
Rene 0
Downs, 0
who 0
has 0
spent 0
the 0
past 0
few 0
days 0
doing 0
interviews 0
about 0
a 0
shooter 0
inside 0
the 0
Bellagio 0
Hotel. 0

Slowly 1
but 1
surely 1
we 0
are 0
starting 0
to 0
see 0
the 0
official 0
narrative 0
regarding 0
the 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
Massacre 0
be 0
completely 0
destroyed. 0

At 0
this 0
point 0
it 1
is 1
strikingly 1
obvious 1
that 1
authorities 1
have 1
lied 1
to 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
about 0
the 0
worst 0
mass 0
shooting 0
in 0
our 0
countries 0
history. 0

One 1
can 1
only 1
speculate 1
as 1
to 1
what 1
the 1
reasons 1
for 1
these 1
lies 1
actually 1
are? 1
