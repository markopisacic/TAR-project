the 0 29 1

During 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
confessional, 0 29 2
a 0 29 2
Canadian 0 29 2
man 0 29 2
by 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
name 0 29 2
of 0 29 2
Jeff 0 29 2
detailed 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
fact 0 29 2
that 0 29 2
he 0 29 2
and 0 29 2
his 0 29 2
wife 0 29 2
were 0 29 2
in 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
Bellagio 0 29 2
Resort 0 29 2
and 0 29 2
Casino 0 29 2
around 0 29 2
11:20pm 0 29 2
on 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
night 0 29 2
of 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
shooting 0 29 2
when 0 29 2
panic 0 29 2
broke 0 29 2
out 0 29 2
in 0 29 2
the 0 29 2
hotels 0 29 2
lobby. 0 29 2

Jeff 0 29 3
begins 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
interview 0 29 3
by 0 29 3
making 0 29 3
clear 0 29 3
his 0 29 3
belief 0 29 3
that 0 29 3
there 0 29 3
were 0 29 3
multiple 0 29 3
active 0 29 3
shooters 0 29 3
targeting 0 29 3
different 0 29 3
places 0 29 3
in 0 29 3
Las 0 29 3
Vegas 0 29 3
on 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
night 0 29 3
of 0 29 3
the 0 29 3
attack. 0 29 3

“First 0 29 4
of 0 29 4
all, 0 29 4
I 0 29 4
think 0 29 4
what 0 29 4
needs 0 29 4
to 0 29 4
be 0 29 4
said 0 29 4
is 0 29 4
that, 0 29 4
from 0 29 4
my 0 29 4
perspective, 0 29 4
there 0 29 4
were 0 29 4
multiple 0 29 4
events 0 29 4
that 0 29 4
occurred 0 29 4
around 0 29 4
Las 0 29 4
Vegas, 0 29 4
up 0 29 4
and 0 29 4
down 0 29 4
the 0 29 4
Strip 0 29 4
that 0 29 4
night. 0 29 4

It 0 29 5
wasn’t 0 29 5
just 0 29 5
centralized 0 29 5
around 0 29 5
the 0 29 5
Mandalay 0 29 5
Hotel,” 0 29 5
the 0 29 5
witness 0 29 5
claimed. 0 29 5

The 0 29 6
eyewitness 0 29 6
then 0 29 6
goes 0 29 6
on 0 29 6
to 0 29 6
directly 0 29 6
say 0 29 6
that 0 29 6
he 0 29 6
and 0 29 6
his 0 29 6
wife 0 29 6
were 0 29 6
involved 0 29 6
in 0 29 6
an 0 29 6
active 0 29 6
shooter 0 29 6
situation 0 29 6
at 0 29 6
a 0 29 6
different 0 29 6
hotel 0 29 6
that 0 29 6
authorities 0 29 6
have 0 29 6
so 0 29 6
far 0 29 6
done 0 29 6
everything 0 29 6
in 0 29 6
their 0 29 6
power 0 29 6
to 0 29 6
cover-up. 0 29 6

“My 0 29 7
wife 0 29 7
and 0 29 7
I 0 29 7
were 0 29 7
in 0 29 7
Las 0 29 7
Vegas 0 29 7
celebrating 0 29 7
our 0 29 7
10th 0 29 7
anniversary 0 29 7
and 0 29 7
on 0 29 7
October 0 29 7
1st 0 29 7
we 0 29 7
were 0 29 7
involved 0 29 7
in 0 29 7
an 0 29 7
incident 0 29 7
with 0 29 7
an 0 29 7
active 0 29 7
shooter 0 29 7
at 0 29 7
the 0 29 7
Bellagio. 0 29 7

There 0 29 8
is 0 29 8
no 0 29 8
mistake 0 29 8
in 0 29 8
my 0 29 8
mind 0 29 8
about 0 29 8
it,” 0 29 8
he 0 29 8
continued. 0 29 8

Jeff 0 29 9
then 0 29 9
describes 0 29 9
a 0 29 9
scene 0 29 9
in 0 29 9
which 0 29 9
he 0 29 9
and 0 29 9
his 0 29 9
wife 0 29 9
were 0 29 9
walking 0 29 9
through 0 29 9
the 0 29 9
main 0 29 9
lobby 0 29 9
when 0 29 9
screams 0 29 9
and 0 29 9
gunfire 0 29 9
erupted. 0 29 9

Keep 1 29 10
in 1 29 10
mind, 1 29 10
this 1 29 10
is 1 29 10
all 1 29 10
information 1 29 10
that 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
police 1 29 10
and 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
FBI 1 29 10
has 1 29 10
hidden 1 29 10
from 1 29 10
the 1 29 10
American 1 29 10
people. 1 29 10

“All 0 29 11
of 0 29 11
a 0 29 11
sudden 0 29 11
there 0 29 11
was 0 29 11
just 0 29 11
a 0 29 11
crescendo 0 29 11
of 0 29 11
screams 0 29 11
that 0 29 11
started 0 29 11
behind 0 29 11
us 0 29 11
in 0 29 11
the 0 29 11
lobby,” 0 29 11
he 0 29 11
claimed. 0 29 11

“Then 0 29 12
I 0 29 12
heard 0 29 12
somebody 0 29 12
yell 0 29 12
‘there’s 0 29 12
a 0 29 12
shooter! 0 29 12

There’s 0 29 13
a 0 29 13
shooter!’ 0 29 13
And 0 29 13
then 0 29 13
I 0 29 13
heard 0 29 13
like 0 29 13
five 0 29 13
or 0 29 13
six 0 29 13
pops, 0 29 13
like 0 29 13
unmistakable 0 29 13
gunfire, 0 29 13
unmistakably.” 0 29 13

“That 0 29 14
was 0 29 14
about 0 29 14
11:20 0 29 14
when 0 29 14
we 0 29 14
heard 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
shots 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
screams… 0 29 14
at 0 29 14
that 0 29 14
point 0 29 14
you 0 29 14
could 0 29 14
hear 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
see 0 29 14
the 0 29 14
screams 0 29 14
and 0 29 14
see 0 29 14
hundreds 0 29 14
of 0 29 14
people 0 29 14
coming 0 29 14
towards 0 29 14
us.” 0 29 14

Amazingly, 0 29 15
as 0 29 15
Shepard 0 29 15
Ambellas 0 29 15
noted, 0 29 15
“The 0 29 15
man’s 0 29 15
claims 0 29 15
match 0 29 15
up 0 29 15
to 0 29 15
actual 0 29 15
events 0 29 15
captured 0 29 15
in 0 29 15
police 0 29 15
audio 0 29 15
recordings 0 29 15
from 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
night 0 29 15
of 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
shooting 0 29 15
which 0 29 15
confirms 0 29 15
that 0 29 15
between 0 29 15
11:15 0 29 15
and 0 29 15
11:18 0 29 15
p.m. 0 29 15
on 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
night 0 29 15
of 0 29 15
Oct. 0 29 15
1 0 29 15
there 0 29 15
was, 0 29 15
in 0 29 15
fact, 0 29 15
something 0 29 15
going 0 29 15
on 0 29 15
at 0 29 15
the 0 29 15
Bellagio.” 0 29 15

This 0 29 16
testimony 0 29 16
also 0 29 16
backs 0 29 16
up 0 29 16
claims 0 29 16
by 0 29 16
another 0 29 16
eyewitness, 0 29 16
Rene 0 29 16
Downs, 0 29 16
who 0 29 16
has 0 29 16
spent 0 29 16
the 0 29 16
past 0 29 16
few 0 29 16
days 0 29 16
doing 0 29 16
interviews 0 29 16
about 0 29 16
a 0 29 16
shooter 0 29 16
inside 0 29 16
the 0 29 16
Bellagio 0 29 16
Hotel. 0 29 16

Slowly 1 29 17
but 1 29 17
surely 1 29 17
we 0 29 17
are 0 29 17
starting 0 29 17
to 0 29 17
see 0 29 17
the 0 29 17
official 0 29 17
narrative 0 29 17
regarding 0 29 17
the 0 29 17
Las 0 29 17
Vegas 0 29 17
Massacre 0 29 17
be 0 29 17
completely 0 29 17
destroyed. 0 29 17

At 0 29 18
this 0 29 18
point 0 29 18
it 1 29 18
is 1 29 18
strikingly 1 29 18
obvious 1 29 18
that 1 29 18
authorities 1 29 18
have 1 29 18
lied 1 29 18
to 1 29 18
the 1 29 18
American 1 29 18
people 1 29 18
about 0 29 18
the 0 29 18
worst 0 29 18
mass 0 29 18
shooting 0 29 18
in 0 29 18
our 0 29 18
countries 0 29 18
history. 0 29 18

One 1 29 18

can 1 29 18

only 1 29 18

speculate 1 29 18

as 1 29 18

to 1 29 18

what 1 29 18

the 1 29 18

reasons 1 29 18

for 1 29 18

these 1 29 18

lies 1 29 18

actually 1 29 18

are? 1 29 18
