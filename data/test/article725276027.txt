She 0
entered 0

Ronaldo 0
Rauseo-Ricupero, 0

argued 0
they 0

have 0
90 0

“That’s 1

not 0

just 0
does 0
not 0

that 0

no 0

and 0
there 0

no 0
evidence 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
face 0

today. 0

She 0
and 0

have 0
acted 0
outside 0

something 0
that 0
the 0

surprisingly 0
puts 0
in 0
the 0

the 0

Saris 0
thinks 0
that 0
her 0
feelings 0
about 0

are 0
the 0
same 0
as 0
the 0
law.Well, 0
that 0
