Jeff 0
Flake 0
in 0
his 0
oration 0
against 0
President 0
Trump, 0
just 0
before 0
he 0
announced 0
he 0
will 0
be 0
quitting 0
the 0
Senate. 0

Though 0
he 0
had 0
lifted 0
the 0
title 0
of 0
his 0
August 0
anti-Trump 0
polemic, 0
"Conscience 0

Barry 0
Goldwater, 0
Jeff 0
Flake 0
is 0
no 0
Barry 0

Goldwater 0
took 0
on 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment 0
in 0
the 0
primaries, 0
voted 0
against 0
the 0
Civil 0
Rights 0
Act 0
of 0
1964, 0
defiantly 0
declared, 0
"Extremism 1
in 1
the 1
defense 1
of 1
liberty 1
is 1
no 1
vice," 1
and 0
then 0
went 0
down 0
to 0
defeat 0
battling 0
to 0
the 0
end 0
after 0
the 0
assassination 0
of 0
JFK 0
made 0
LBJ 0
invincible. 0

The 0
real 0
"Mr. 1
Conservative" 1
was 0
a 0
true 0
profile 0
in 0
courage. 0

Flake, 0
with 0
only 0
18 0
percent 0
approval 0
in 0
Arizona, 0
decided 0
to 0
pack 0
it 0
in 0
rather 0
than 0
get 0
waxed 0
in 0
his 0
own 0
primary. 0

With 0
Falstaff, 0
Flake 0
appears 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
"discretion 1
is 1
the 1
better 1
part 1
of 1
valor." 1

Sen. 0
Bob 0
Corker 0
is 0
another 0
summertime 1
soldier 1
calling 0
on 0
colleagues 0
to 0
stand 0
and 0
fight 0
Trump 0
while 1
he 1
retires 1
to 1
Tennessee. 1

It's 0
no 0
wonder 0
the 0
establishment 0
is 0
viewed 0
with 0
such 0
derision. 1

Flake 0
calls 0
Trump 0
"dangerous 1
to 1
our 1
democracy." 1

But 0
the 0
real 0
threat 0
Trump 0
represents 0
is 0
to 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment's 0
control 0
of 0
the 0
party's 0
agenda 0
and 0
the 0
party's 0
destiny. 0

U.S. 0
politics 0
have 0
indeed 0
been 0
coarsened, 0
with 0
Trump 0
playing 0
a 0
lead 0
role. 0

Yet, 0
beneath 0
the 0
savagery 1
of 0
the 0
uncivil 0
war 0
in 0
the 0
party 0
lies 0
more 0
than 0
personal 0
insults 0
and 0
personality 0
clashes. 0

This 0
is 0
a 0
struggle 0
about 0
policy, 0
about 1
the 1
future. 1

And 0
Trump 1
is 1
president 1
because 1
he 1
read 1
the 1
party 1
and 1
the 1
country 1
right, 1
while 0
the 0
Bush-McCain 0
Republican 0
establishment 0
had 0
lost 0
touch 0
with 0
both. 0

How 1
could 1
the 1
Beltway 1
GOP 1
not 1
see 1
that 0
its 0
defining 0
policies 0
— 0
open 0
borders, 0
amnesty, 0
free 0
trade 0
globalism, 0
compulsive 0
military 0
intervention 0
in 0
foreign 0
lands 0
for 0
ideological 0
ends 0
— 0
were 0
alienating 0
its 0
coalition? 0

What 1
had 1
a 1
quarter 1
century 1
of 1
Bushite 1
free 1
trade 1
produced? 1

About 0
$12 0
trillion 0
in 0
trade 0
deficits, 0
$4 0
trillion 0
with 0
China 0
alone, 0
a 0
loss 0
of 0
55,000 0
plants 0
and 0
6 0
million 0
manufacturing 0
jobs. 0

We 0
imported 0
goods 0
"Made 0
in 0
China," 0
while 0
exporting 0
our 1
future. 1

U.S. 0
elites 0
made 0
China 0
great 0
again, 0
to 0
where 0
Beijing 0
is 0
now 0
challenging 0
our 0
strategic 0
position 0
and 0
presence 0
in 0
Asia. 0

Could 1
Republicans 1
not 1
see 1
the 0
factories 0
shutting 0
down, 0
or 0
not 0
understand 0
why 0
workers' 0
wages 0
had 0
failed 0
to 0
rise 0
for 0
decades? 0

What 0
did 0
the 0
democracy 0
crusades 0
"to 1
end 1
tyranny 1
in 1
our 1
world" 1
accomplish? 0

Thousands 0
of 0
U.S. 1
dead, 1
tens 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 1
wounded, 1
trillions 1
of 1
dollars 1
sunk, 1
and 0
a 0
Mideast 0
awash 1
in 1
blood 1
from 0
Afghanistan 0
to 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
Syria 0
and 0
Yemen, 0
with 0
millions 1
uprooted 1
and 1
homeless. 1

Yet, 0
still, 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment 0
has 0
not 0
repudiated 0
the 0
mindset 0
that 0
produced 0
this. 0

With 0
the 0
Cold 0
War 0
over 0
for 0
a 0
quarter 0
of 0
a 0
century, 0
what 0
is 0
the 0
case 0
now 0
for 0
America, 0
$20 0
trillion 0
in 0
debt, 0
going 0
abroad 0
in 0
search 0
of 0
monsters 1
to 0
destroy? 1

Consider. 0

Bush-Obama 0
"open 0
borders" 0
brought 0
in 0
tens 0
of 0
millions 0
of 0
Third 0
World 0
peoples, 0
legally 0
and 0
illegally, 0
to 0
rising 0
resistance 0
from 0
Americans 1
forced 0
to 0
bear 0
the 0
economic 0
and 0
social 0
costs. 0

What 0
was 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment's 0
reply 0
to 0
the 0
opposition 0
to 0
amnesty 0
for 0
illegals 0
and 0
calls 0
for 0
a 0
moratorium 0
on 0
legal 0
immigration, 0
to 0
assimilate 0
the 0
tens 0
of 0
millions 0
already 0
here? 0

To 0
call 0
them 0
nativists 1
and 0
parade 1
their 0
moral 0
superiority. 1

Flake 0
and 0
Corker 0
are 0
being 0
beatified 0
by 0
the 0
Beltway 0
elites, 0
and 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush 0
and 0
John 0
McCain 0
celebrated 0
for 0
their 0
denunciations 0
of 0
Trumpism. 1

Yet 0
no 1
two 1
people 1
are 1
more 1
responsible 1
for 0
the 0
blunders 1
of 0
the 0
post-Cold 0
War 0
era 0
than 0
McCain 0
and 0
Bush. 0

About 1
which 1
of 1
half 1
a 1
dozen 1
wars 1
were 1
they 1
right? 1

Yesterday's 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
recognized 0
Trump's 0
triumph: 1

"Despite 0
the 0
fervor 0
of 0
President 0
Trump's 0
Republican 0
opponents, 0
the 0
president's 0
brand 0
of 0
hard-edged 1
nationalism—with 0
its 0
gut-level 1
cultural 0
appeals 0
and 0
hard 0
lines 0
on 0
trade 0
and 0
immigration—is 0
taking 0
root 0
within 0
his 0
adopted 0
party." 0

Moreover, 0
a 0
new 0
question 0
arises: 0

Can 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment 0
believe 0
that 0
if 0
Trump 0
falls, 0
or 0
they 0
bring 0
him 0
down, 0
they 0
will 0
inherit 0
the 0
estate 0
and 0
be 0
welcomed 0
home 0
like 0
the 0
Prodigal 1
Son? 1

Do 1
they 1
believe 1
their 1
old 1
agenda 1
of 1
open 1
borders, 1
amnesty, 1
free 1
trade 1
globalism 1
and 1
democracy-crusading 1
can 1
become 1
America's 1
agenda 1
again? 1

Trumpism 1
is 0
not 0
a 0
detour, 0
after 0
which 0
we 0
can 0
all 0
get 0
back 0
on 0
the 0
interstate 0
to 0
the 0
New 0
World 0
Order. 0

For 0
though 0
unpleasant, 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
unfair 0
to 0
say 0
that 0
if 0
there 0
was 0
one 0
desire 0
common 0
to 0
Bernie 0
Sanders, 0
Ted 0
Cruz 0
and 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
voters, 0
it 0
was 0
be 0
rid 0
of 0
the 0
regime 0
resting 0
on 0
top 0
of 0
all 0
of 0
us. 0

Should 1
Trump 1
fall, 1
and 1
a 1
restored 1
establishment 1
attempt 1
to 1
reimpose 1
the 1
old 1
policies, 1
there 1
will 1
be 1
a 1
truly 1
uncivil 1
war 1
in 1
this 1
country. 1

After 1
the 1
Trumpian 1
revolt, 1
there 1
is 1
no 1
going 1
back. 1

As 0
that 0
most 1
American 1
of 1
writers, 1
Thomas 0
Wolfe, 0
put 0
it, 0
"You 0
can't 0
go 0
home 0
again." 0

Traditionalists 0
have 0
been 0
told 0
that 0
for 0
years. 0

Now 0
it's 0
the 0
turn 0
of 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment 0
to 0
learn 0
the 0
truth 0
as 0
well. 0

Goldwater 0
lost 0
badly, 0
but 0
the 0
establishment 0
that 0
abandoned 0
him 0
never 0
had 0
its 0
patrimony 0
restored. 0

It 0
was 0
the 0
leaders 0
they 0
abhorred, 0
Richard 0
Nixon 0
and 0
Ronald 0
Reagan, 0
to 0
whom 0
the 0
future 0
belonged. 0
