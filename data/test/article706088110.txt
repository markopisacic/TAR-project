States 0 59 1
and 0 59 1
submitted 0 59 1
asylum 0 59 1

Those 0 59 2

The 0 59 3
claims 0 59 3
were 0 59 3
rejected 0 59 3
as 0 59 3
unsubstantiated 0 59 3
and 0 59 3
the 0 59 3
illegal 0 59 3

However, 0 59 4
the 0 59 4
Department 0 59 4
of 0 59 4
Homeland 0 59 4
Security 0 59 4
(DHS) 0 59 4
declined 0 59 4

that 0 59 5
the 0 59 5
cases 0 59 5
involving 0 59 5
Indonesian 0 59 5

were 0 59 5
free 0 59 5
to 0 59 5
remain 0 59 5
in 0 59 5
the 0 59 5
United 0 59 5
States, 0 59 5
those 0 59 5
illegal 0 59 5
aliens 0 59 5
did 0 59 5
not 0 59 5
make 0 59 5
any 0 59 5
effort 0 59 5
to 0 59 5
appeal 0 59 5
their 0 59 5
outstanding 0 59 5
orders. 0 59 5

Then 0 59 6
the 0 59 6
United 0 59 6
States 0 59 6
had 0 59 6
an 0 59 6
election, 0 59 6

Then 0 59 7
suddenly, 0 59 7
those 0 59 7

First, 0 59 15
let's 0 59 15
deal 0 59 15
with 0 59 15
the 0 59 15
misleading 0 59 15
reporting. 0 59 15

Rombot 0 59 16
was 0 59 16
not 0 59 16
taken 0 59 16
into 0 59 16
custody 0 59 16
based 0 59 16
on 0 59 16
any 0 59 16
ICE 0 59 16
policy 0 59 16
of 0 59 16
deporting 0 59 16
all 0 59 16
illegal 1 59 16
aliens. 1 59 16

Rombot 0 59 17
was 0 59 17
taken 0 59 17
into 0 59 17
custody 0 59 17
because 0 59 17
he 0 59 17
had 0 59 17
an 0 59 17
outstanding 0 59 17
Final 0 59 17
Order 0 59 17
Of 0 59 17
Removal; 0 59 17
that's 1 59 17
a 1 59 17
big 1 59 17
difference 1 59 17
and 1 59 17
symptomatic 1 59 17
of 1 59 17
the 1 59 17
lies 1 59 17
from 1 59 17
reporters 1 59 17
like 1 59 17
Raymond. 1 59 17

Saris 0 59 18
previously 0 59 18
ordered 0 59 18
a 0 59 18
stay 0 59 18
to 0 59 18
the 0 59 18
deportations. 0 59 18

She 0 59 19
is 0 59 19
currently 0 59 19
weighing 0 59 19
whether 0 59 19
she 0 59 19
can 0 59 19
order 0 59 19
a 0 59 19
longer 0 59 19
delay 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
give 0 59 19
the 0 59 19
affected 0 59 19
people 0 59 19
time 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
renew 0 59 19
their 0 59 19
efforts 0 59 19
to 0 59 19
gain 0 59 19
legal 0 59 19
status. 0 59 19

Now, 0 59 20
with 0 59 20
regard 0 59 20
to 0 59 20
Saris, 0 59 20
she 0 59 20
has 0 59 20
no 0 59 20
authority 0 59 20
to 0 59 20
interfere 0 59 20
with 0 59 20
the 0 59 20
pre-deportation 0 59 20
custody 0 59 20
of 0 59 20
an 0 59 20
illegal 1 59 20
alien 1 59 20
with 0 59 20
a 0 59 20
Final 0 59 20
Order 0 59 20
Of 0 59 20
Removal. 0 59 20

Rombot 0 59 21
was 0 59 21
taken 0 59 21
into 0 59 21
custody 0 59 21
because 0 59 21
he 0 59 21
was 0 59 21
soon 0 59 21
to 0 59 21
be 0 59 21
deported. 0 59 21

There 0 59 22
was 0 59 22
no 0 59 22
issue 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
Indonesia 0 59 22
not 0 59 22
accepting 0 59 22
him 0 59 22
nor 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
Indonesia 0 59 22
not 0 59 22
providing 0 59 22
a 0 59 22
travel 0 59 22
document, 0 59 22
so 0 59 22
there 0 59 22
was 0 59 22
no 0 59 22
question 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
him 0 59 22
being 0 59 22
held 0 59 22
in 0 59 22
custody 0 59 22
longer 0 59 22
than 0 59 22
allowed 0 59 22
in 0 59 22
the 0 59 22
St. 0 59 22
Cyr 0 59 22
decision 0 59 22
that 0 59 22
restricted 0 59 22
custody 0 59 22
of 0 59 22
illegal 1 59 22
aliens 1 59 22
with 0 59 22
Final 0 59 22
Orders 0 59 22
Of 0 59 22
Removal 0 59 22
who 0 59 22
for 0 59 22
whatever 0 59 22
reason 0 59 22
were 0 59 22
unlikely 0 59 22
to 0 59 22
be 0 59 22
successfully 0 59 22
deported. 0 59 22

She 0 59 23
still 0 59 23
thinks 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
she 0 59 23
can 0 59 23
review 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
underlying 0 59 23
decision 0 59 23
of 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
immigration 0 59 23
court 0 59 23
as 0 59 23
well.In 0 59 23
fact, 0 59 23
Saris' 0 59 23
actions 0 59 23
appear 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
more 0 59 23
akin 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
of 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
Mexican 0 59 23
kritarch 0 59 23
Monica 0 59 23
Herranz 0 59 23
who 0 59 23
aided 0 59 23
an 0 59 23
illegal 1 59 23
alien 1 59 23
to 0 59 23
escape 0 59 23
arrest 0 59 23
by 0 59 23
ICE 0 59 23
when 0 59 23
she 0 59 23
let 0 59 23
that 0 59 23
illegal 1 59 23
alien 1 59 23
leave 0 59 23
her 0 59 23
courtroom 0 59 23
through 0 59 23
the 0 59 23
exit 0 59 23
to 0 59 23
her 0 59 23
judicial 0 59 23
chambers. 0 59 23

Saris 0 59 24
is 0 59 24
clearly 0 59 24
scheming 0 59 24
to 0 59 24
help 0 59 24
Rombot 0 59 24
escape 0 59 24
