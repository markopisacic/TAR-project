The 0 5 3
prickly 1 5 3
North 0 5 3
Koreans 0 5 3
had 0 5 3
a 0 5 3
fit, 0 5 3
of 0 5 3
course, 0 5 3
as 0 5 3
always 0 5 3
when 0 5 3
the 0 5 3

Who 0 5 6
can 0 5 6

the 0 5 6
North 0 5 6
Koreans 0 5 6
for 0 5 6
blowing 0 5 6
their 0 5 6

As 0 5 7
Trump 0 5 7
administration 0 5 7
mouthpieces 0 5 7
were 0 5 7
gabbing 1 5 7
about 0 5 7
peace 0 5 7
and 0 5 7
light, 0 5 7
the 0 5 7
US 0 5 7

missile-armed 0 5 7

lurked 0 5 7
at 0 5 7

This 0 5 8

In 0 5 9

North 0 5 9
Korea 0 5 9
failed 0 5 9

after 0 5 10

‘eat 1 5 11

leading 0 5 12
to 0 5 12

Hardly 0 5 13
an 0 5 13
encouragement 0 5 13
for 0 5 13
North 0 5 13
Korea. 0 5 13

North 0 5 14
Korea 0 5 14
was 0 5 14
right 0 5 14
on 0 5 14
target 0 5 14
when 0 5 14
it 0 5 14
accused 0 5 14
arch-neocon 0 5 14
John 0 5 14

of 0 5 14
trying 0 5 14
to 0 5 14
sabotage 0 5 14
the 0 5 14
peace 0 5 14
deal. 0 5 14

In 0 5 15
2005-2006, 0 5 15
Bolton 0 5 15
served 0 5 15
as 0 5 15
the 0 5 15
Bush 0 5 15
administration’s 0 5 15
ambassador 0 5 15
to 0 5 15
the 0 5 15
UN. 0 5 15

He 0 5 16
established 0 5 16
a 0 5 16
tradition 0 5 16
for 0 5 16
the 0 5 16
post 0 5 16
of 0 5 16
being 0 5 16
anti-Muslim, 0 5 16
pro-Israel 0 5 16
and 0 5 16
anti-Russian, 0 5 16
a 0 5 16
policy 0 5 16
continued 0 5 16
to 0 5 16
this 0 5 16
day 0 5 16
by 0 5 16
the 0 5 16
current 0 5 16
US 0 5 16
UN 0 5 16
rep, 0 5 16
loud-mouthed 0 5 16
neocon 0 5 16
Nikki 0 5 16
Haley. 0 5 16

In 0 5 17
the 0 5 17
2005-2006 0 5 17
period, 0 5 17
after 0 5 17
years 0 5 17
of 0 5 17
negotiations, 0 5 17
the 0 5 17
US 0 5 17
and 0 5 17
North 0 5 17
Korea 0 5 17
were 0 5 17
close 0 5 17
to 0 5 17
a 0 5 17
nuclear/peace 0 5 17
deal. 0 5 17

Enter 0 5 18
John 0 5 18
Bolton. 0 5 18

He 0 5 19
succeeded 0 5 19
in 0 5 19
sabotaging 0 5 19
the 0 5 19
US-North 0 5 19
Korea 0 5 19
deal. 0 5 19

Why? 0 5 20

Because 0 5 21
Bolton, 0 5 21
as 0 5 21
an 0 5 21
arch 0 5 21
neocon, 0 5 21
was 0 5 21
fanatically 1 5 21
pro-Israel 0 5 21
and 0 5 21
feared 0 5 21
that 0 5 21
North 0 5 21
Korea 0 5 21
might 0 5 21
provide 0 5 21
nuclear 0 5 21
technology 0 5 21
to 0 5 21
Israel’s 0 5 21
foes. 0 5 21

As 0 5 22
usual 0 5 22
with 0 5 22
the 0 5 22
neocons, 0 5 22
Israel’s 0 5 22
interests 0 5 22
came 0 5 22
before 0 5 22
those 0 5 22
of 0 5 22
the 0 5 22
United 0 5 22
States. 0 5 22

Trump’s 0 5 23
newly 0 5 23
named 0 5 23
Secretary 0 5 23
of 0 5 23
State, 0 5 23
Michael 0 5 23
Pompeo, 0 5 23
is 0 5 23
also 0 5 23
an 0 5 23
ardent 0 5 23
neocon. 0 5 23

Last 0 5 24
week, 0 5 24
Bolton 0 5 24
went 0 5 24
onto 0 5 24
US 0 5 24
TV 0 5 24
and 0 5 24
actually 0 5 24
suggested 0 5 24
North 0 5 24
Korea 0 5 24
might 0 5 24
follow 0 5 24
the 0 5 24
course 0 5 24
set 0 5 24
by 0 5 24
Libya, 0 5 24
of 0 5 24
all 0 5 24
places. 0 5 24

Libya’s 0 5 25
then 0 5 25
ruler, 0 5 25
Muammar 0 5 25
Kadaffi, 0 5 25
bought 0 5 25
some 0 5 25
nuclear 0 5 25
equipment 0 5 25
from 0 5 25
Pakistan 0 5 25
so 0 5 25
he 0 5 25
could 0 5 25
hand 0 5 25
it 0 5 25
over 0 5 25
to 0 5 25
the 0 5 25
US 0 5 25
as 0 5 25
a 0 5 25
gesture 0 5 25
of 0 5 25
cooperation 0 5 25
after 0 5 25
the 0 5 25
Bush 0 5 25
administration 0 5 25
invaded 0 5 25
Iraq. 0 5 25

The 0 5 26
handover 0 5 26
was 0 5 26
done 0 5 26
with 0 5 26
much 1 5 26
fanfare, 1 5 26
then 0 5 26
the 0 5 26
US, 0 5 26
France 0 5 26
and 0 5 26
Britain 0 5 26
attacked 0 5 26
Libya 0 5 26
and 0 5 26
overthrew 0 5 26
Kadaffi. 0 5 26

The 0 5 27
hapless 1 5 27
Libyan 0 5 27
leader 0 5 27
was 0 5 27
eventually 0 5 27
murdered 0 5 27
by 0 5 27
French 0 5 27
agents. 0 5 27

Is 1 5 29
this 1 5 29
what 1 5 29
Bolton 1 5 29
has 1 5 29
in 1 5 29
mind 1 5 29
for 1 5 29
North 1 5 29
Korea? 1 5 29

The 0 5 30
Northerners 0 5 30
certainly 0 5 30
seemed 0 5 30
to 0 5 30
think 0 5 30
so. 0 5 30

Some 0 5 31
wondered 0 5 31
if 0 5 31
Bolton 0 5 31
and 0 5 31
perhaps 0 5 31
Pompeo 0 5 31
were 0 5 31

to 0 5 31
sabotage 0 5 31
the 0 5 31

Or 0 5 32
were 0 5 32
at 0 5 32
least 0 5 32
being 0 5 32
incredibly 1 5 32
obtuse 1 5 32
and 0 5 32
belligerent. 0 5 32

Was 1 5 33
Trump 1 5 33
involved 1 5 33
in 1 5 33
this 1 5 33
intrigue? 1 5 33

Hard 0 5 34
to 0 5 34
tell. 0 5 34

But 0 5 35
he 0 5 35
can’t 0 5 35
be 0 5 35
happy. 0 5 35

His 0 5 36
minions 1 5 36
and 0 5 36

are 0 5 36
promoting 0 5 36
Trump 0 5 36

– 0 5 36
rather 0 5 36
ahead 0 5 36

Or 0 5 37
was 0 5 37
the 0 5 37
US 0 5 37

rattling 0 5 37
its 0 5 37

a 0 5 38

sweetness 0 5 39
and 0 5 39
light 0 5 39
coming 0 5 39

just 0 5 39
sounds 0 5 39

good 1 5 39

be 1 5 39
true. 1 5 39

Veteran 0 5 40
Korea 0 5 40

this 0 5 40

give 0 5 40
up 0 5 40

dealing 0 5 40

Iran 0 5 40

Speaking 0 5 41
of 0 5 41
de-nuclearization, 0 5 41
why 0 5 41
does 0 5 41
North 0 5 41
