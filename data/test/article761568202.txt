happened 0 238 1
during 0 238 1

Among 0 238 2
other 0 238 2
things, 0 238 2
Clinton 0 238 2
says 0 238 2
Lewinsky 0 238 2
is 0 238 2
not 0 238 2
owed 0 238 2
an 0 238 2
apology 0 238 2
from 0 238 2
him 0 238 2
and 0 238 2
he 0 238 2
“did 0 238 2
the 0 238 2

As 0 238 3
reported 0 238 3
by 0 238 3
CNN, 0 238 3
Speaking 0 238 3
to 0 238 3
Today, 0 238 3
Clinton 0 238 3
defended 0 238 3
his 0 238 3
decision 0 238 3
to 0 238 3
remain 0 238 3
in 0 238 3
office 0 238 3
following 0 238 3
the 0 238 3
scandal. 0 238 3

“A 0 238 4
lot 0 238 4
of 0 238 4
the 0 238 4
facts 0 238 4
have 0 238 4
been 0 238 4
conveniently 0 238 4
omitted 0 238 4
to 0 238 4
make 0 238 4
the 0 238 4
story 0 238 4
work, 0 238 4
I 0 238 4
think 0 238 4
partly 0 238 4
because 0 238 4
they’re 0 238 4
frustrated 0 238 4
that 0 238 4
they 0 238 4
got 0 238 4
all 0 238 4
these 0 238 4
serious 0 238 4
allegations 0 238 4
against 0 238 4
the 0 238 4
current 0 238 4
occupant 0 238 4
of 0 238 4
the 0 238 4
Oval 0 238 4
Office 0 238 4
and 0 238 4
his 0 238 4
voters 0 238 4
don’t 0 238 4
seem 0 238 4
to 0 238 4
care,” 0 238 4
Clinton 0 238 4
said, 0 238 4
pointing 0 238 4
to 0 238 4
a 0 238 4
series 0 238 4
of 0 238 4
sexual 1 238 4
misconduct 1 238 4
allegations 0 238 4
against 0 238 4

them. 0 238 4

“I 0 238 5

I 0 238 5
did 0 238 5
the 0 238 5
right 0 238 5
thing. 0 238 5

I 0 238 6
defended 0 238 6
the 0 238 6
Constitution.” 0 238 6

In 0 238 7
an 0 238 7
essay 0 238 7
for 0 238 7
Vanity 0 238 7
Fair 0 238 7
published 0 238 7
earlier 0 238 7
this 0 238 7
year, 0 238 7
Lewinsky 0 238 7
said 0 238 7
she 0 238 7
was 0 238 7
questioning 0 238 7
the 0 238 7
narrative 0 238 7
surrounding 0 238 7
the 0 238 7
affair, 0 238 7
which 0 238 7
played 0 238 7
a 0 238 7
central 0 238 7
role 0 238 7
in 0 238 7
Clinton’s 0 238 7
eventual 0 238 7
impeachment. 0 238 7

“Now, 0 238 8
at 0 238 8
44, 0 238 8
I’m 0 238 8
beginning 0 238 8
(just 0 238 8
beginning) 0 238 8
to 0 238 8
consider 0 238 8
the 0 238 8
implications 0 238 8
of 0 238 8
power 0 238 8
differentials 0 238 8
that 0 238 8
were 0 238 8
so 0 238 8
vast 0 238 8
between 0 238 8
a 0 238 8
president 0 238 8
and 0 238 8
a 0 238 8
White 0 238 8
House 0 238 8
intern,” 0 238 8
she 0 238 8
wrote. 0 238 8

“I’m 0 238 9
beginning 0 238 9
to 0 238 9
entertain 0 238 9
the 0 238 9
notion 0 238 9
that 0 238 9
in 0 238 9
such 0 238 9
a 0 238 9
circumstance 0 238 9
the 0 238 9
idea 0 238 9
of 0 238 9
consent 0 238 9
might 0 238 9
well 0 238 9
be 0 238 9
rendered 0 238 9
moot.” 0 238 9

When 0 238 10
asked 0 238 10
if 0 238 10
he 0 238 10
owed 0 238 10
Lewinsky 0 238 10
an 0 238 10
apology, 0 238 10
President 0 238 10
Clinton 0 238 10
told 0 238 10
NBC‘s 0 238 10
Craig 0 238 10
Melvin, 0 238 10
“No, 0 238 10
I 0 238 10
do 0 238 10
not 0 238 10
— 0 238 10
I 0 238 10
have 0 238 10
never 0 238 10
talked 0 238 10
to 0 238 10
her. 0 238 10

But 0 238 11
I 0 238 11
did 0 238 11
say 0 238 11
publicly 0 238 11
on 0 238 11
more 0 238 11
than 0 238 11
one 0 238 11
occasion 0 238 11
that 0 238 11
I 0 238 11
was 0 238 11
sorry. 0 238 11

That’s 0 238 12
very 0 238 12
different. 0 238 12

The 0 238 13
apology 0 238 13
was 0 238 13
public.” 0 238 13
Although 0 238 13
some 0 238 13
may 0 238 13
not 0 238 13
have 0 238 13
taken 0 238 13
what 0 238 13
Clinton 0 238 13
said 0 238 13
as 0 238 13
an 0 238 13
apology, 0 238 13
he 0 238 13
did 0 238 13
publicly 0 238 13
acknowledge 0 238 13
at 0 238 13
the 0 238 13
National 0 238 13
Prayer 0 238 13
Breakfast 0 238 13
in 0 238 13
1998 0 238 13
that 0 238 13
he 0 238 13
had 0 238 13
“sinned.” 0 238 13

“I 0 238 14
don’t 0 238 14

a 0 238 14

way 0 238 14
to 0 238 14

that 0 238 14
I 0 238 14
have 0 238 14
