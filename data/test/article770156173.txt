End 1

War! 1

“I 0
have 0
some 0
pretty 1
severe 1
things 0
we’re 0
thinking 0
about,” 0
Trump 0
said 0
of 0
North 0
Korea 0
at 0
a 0
news 0
conference 0
in 0
Warsaw. 0

“Doesn’t 0
mean 0
we’re 0
going 0
to 0
do 0
them.” 0

What 0
President 0
Trump 0
really 0
meant 0
is 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
painted 0
the 0
US 0
into 0
a 0
corner 0
with 0
all 0
his 0
threats 0
of 0
war 0
and 0
really 0
does 0
not 0
know 0
what 0
to 0
do 0
next. 0

North 0
Korea 0
called 0
his 0
‘or 0
else’ 0
bluff. 0

Good. 0

No 0
action 0
on 0
North 0
Korea 0
is 0
better 0
than 0
any 0
conceivable 0
military 0
operation. 0

Last 0
week 0
the 0
North 0
Korea 0
test 0
fired 0
a 0
new, 0
longer-ranged 0
strategic 0
missile, 0
Hwasong-14, 0
that 0
US 0
experts 0
claimed 0
was 0
capable 0
of 0
hitting 0
Alaska 0
and 0
perhaps 0
even 0
San 0
Francisco. 0

North 0
Korea 0
is 0
now 0
believed 0
to 0
have 0
mastered 0
a 0
lightweight 0
nuclear 0
warhead 0
that 0
can 0
be 0
carried 0
by 0
the 0
Hwasong 0
and 0
shorter-ranged 0
Taepodong 0
and 0
Nodong 0
missiles. 0

North 0
Korea 0
can’t 0
today 0
seriously 0
threaten 0
North 0
America 0
with 0
missile 0
strikes, 0
but 0
it 0
probably 0
will 0
by 0
2019. 0

Meanwhile, 0
North 0
Korean 0
nuclear 0
and 0
conventionally-armed 0
missiles 0
(and 0
this 0
could 0
include 0
poison 0
gas 0
and 0
biological 0
warheads) 0
today 0
threaten 1
the 0
80,000 0
plus 0
US 0
military 0
personnel 0
based 0
in 0
Japan, 0
South 0
Korea 0
and 0
Guam. 0

They 1
would 1
be 1
immediate 1
targets 1
should 1
the 1
US 1

South 1
Korea 1
attack 1
the 1
north. 1

Why 0
are 0
we 0
even 0

scraped 1
and 1
skimped 1
for 0
decades 0
to 0
build 0
nuclear 0

After 0
Washington 0

it 0

that 0

vulnerable 0

The 0

who 0

not 1

rushed 0

Almost 0
equally 0

North 0
