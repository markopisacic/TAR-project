All 0 151 34
but 0 151 34
proving 0 151 34
the 0 151 34
case 0 151 34
that 0 151 34
this 0 151 34
was 0 151 34
a 0 151 34
coordinated 0 151 34
attack 0 151 34
by 0 151 34
the 0 151 34
tech 0 151 34

shortly 0 151 34
after 0 151 34
the 0 151 34
purge 0 151 34
on 0 151 34
Facebook, 0 151 34
Twitter 0 151 34
followed 0 151 34
suit, 0 151 34
wiping 0 151 34
out 0 151 34
our 0 151 34
profiles 0 151 34
on 0 151 34
there 0 151 34
as 0 151 34
well. 0 151 34

They 0 151 35
gave 0 151 35
absolutely 0 151 35
no 0 151 35
reason 0 151 35
for 0 151 35
the 0 151 35
suspension. 0 151 35

“This 0 151 36
signifies 0 151 36
a 0 151 36
re-consolidation 0 151 36
of 0 151 36
the 0 151 36
media. 0 151 36

Cable 0 151 37
news 0 151 37
media 0 151 37
controlled 0 151 37
the 0 151 37
narrative 0 151 37
for 0 151 37
most 0 151 37
of 0 151 37
modern 0 151 37
history, 0 151 37
but 0 151 37
the 0 151 37
internet 0 151 37
has 0 151 37
lowered 0 151 37
that 0 151 37
barrier 0 151 37
to 0 151 37
entry 0 151 37
and 0 151 37
allowed 0 151 37
the 0 151 37
average 0 151 37
person 0 151 37
to 0 151 37
become 0 151 37
the 0 151 37
media 0 151 37
themselves. 0 151 37

This 0 151 38
obviously 0 151 38
took 0 151 38
market 0 151 38
share 0 151 38
and 0 151 38
influence 0 151 38
away 0 151 38
from 0 151 38
the 0 151 38
traditional 0 151 38
media, 0 151 38
and 0 151 38
it 0 151 38
has 0 151 38
allowed 0 151 38
for 0 151 38
a 0 151 38
more 0 151 38
diverse 0 151 38
public 0 151 38
conversation. 0 151 38

Now 0 151 39
it 0 151 39
seems 0 151 39
the 0 151 39
platforms 0 151 39
that 0 151 39
have 0 151 39
monopolized 0 151 39
the 0 151 39
industry 0 151 39
are 0 151 39
favoring 0 151 39
mainstream 0 151 39
sources 0 151 39
and 0 151 39
silencing 0 151 39
alternative 0 151 39
voices. 0 151 39

So 0 151 40
now, 0 151 40
instead 0 151 40
of 0 151 40
allowing 0 151 40
more 0 151 40

a 0 151 40

these 0 151 40

where 0 151 40
only 0 151 40
