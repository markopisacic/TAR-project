you 1 138 2
a 1 138 2

This 0 138 4

to 0 138 30

she 0 138 30

The 0 138 31

received 0 138 31
2 0 138 31
pages 0 138 31
for 0 138 31
Christianity 0 138 31
from 0 138 31

while 0 138 31
all 0 138 31
the 0 138 31
Islamic 0 138 31
sections 0 138 31
were 0 138 31
left 0 138 31
intact. 0 138 31

Here’s 0 138 32
the 0 138 32
link 0 138 32
for 0 138 32
you 0 138 32
to 0 138 32
review. 0 138 32

You 0 138 33
will 0 138 33
notice 0 138 33
all 0 138 33
the 0 138 33
faith 0 138 33
elements 0 138 33
were 0 138 33
left 0 138 33
out 0 138 33
for 0 138 33
Judaism 0 138 33
and 0 138 33
Christianity 0 138 33
while 0 138 33
the 0 138 33
Islamic 0 138 33
section 0 138 33
was 0 138 33
left 0 138 33
the 0 138 33
way 0 138 33
it’s 0 138 33
presented. 0 138 33

https://www.gvsd.org/cms/lib/PA01001045/Centricity/Domain/610/World%20Religions.pdf 0 138 34
So 0 138 34
she 0 138 34
decided 0 138 34
to 0 138 34
use 0 138 34
the 0 138 34
extra 0 138 34
resources 0 138 34
for 0 138 34
Islam 0 138 34
and 0 138 34
the 0 138 34
school 0 138 34
is 0 138 34
saying 0 138 34
that’s 0 138 34
not 0 138 34
indoctrination 0 138 34
or 0 138 34
proselytizing? 0 138 34

The 0 138 35
faith 0 138 35
aspects 0 138 35
and 0 138 35
the 0 138 35
same 0 138 35
considerations 0 138 35
were 0 138 35
not 0 138 35
given 0 138 35
to 0 138 35
the 0 138 35
others 0 138 35
as 0 138 35
they 0 138 35
were 0 138 35
for 0 138 35
Islam. 0 138 35

This 0 138 36
actually 0 138 36
further 0 138 36
proves 0 138 36
my 0 138 36
point 0 138 36
that 0 138 36
Islam 0 138 36
was 0 138 36
afforded 0 138 36
special 0 138 36
privilege 0 138 36
over 0 138 36
the 0 138 36
others. 0 138 36

The 0 138 37
school 0 138 37
is 0 138 37
backtracking 0 138 37
and 0 138 37
being 0 138 37
deceptive 0 138 37
to 0 138 37
try 0 138 37
and 0 138 37
weasel 0 138 37
out 0 138 37
of 0 138 37
this. 0 138 37

The 0 138 38
teacher 0 138 38
today 0 138 38
clarified 0 138 38
things 0 138 38
for 0 138 38
the 0 138 38
students 0 138 38
but 0 138 38
that 0 138 38
still 0 138 38
does 0 138 38
not 0 138 38
excuse 0 138 38
the 0 138 38
fact 0 138 38
that 0 138 38
they 0 138 38
are 0 138 38
teaching 0 138 38
the 0 138 38
Islamic 0 138 38

and 0 138 38

the 0 138 39
Islamic 0 138 39
packet 0 138 39
again. 0 138 39

They 0 138 40

even 0 138 52
worse. 0 138 52

Rich 0 138 53
Penkoski 0 138 53
has 0 138 53
alerted 0 138 53
me 0 138 53
to 0 138 53

after 0 138 53

What 0 138 54
do 0 138 54
they 0 138 54
have 0 138 54
to 0 138 54
hide? 0 138 54

Apparently, 0 138 55
a 0 138 55
great 0 138 55
deal. 0 138 55

Worse 0 138 56
still, 0 138 56
Penkoski 0 138 56
is 0 138 56
now 0 138 56
being 0 138 56

(And 0 138 57
who 0 138 57

them? 0 138 57

Unidentified 0 138 58
“adult 0 138 58
friends.”) 0 138 58

He 0 138 59
sent 0 138 59
this 0 138 59
message 0 138 59
to 0 138 59
me: 0 138 59

A 0 138 60
student 0 138 60
in 0 138 60
the 0 138 60
school 0 138 60
threatened 1 138 60
to 0 138 60
get 0 138 60
her 0 138 60
adult 0 138 60
friends 0 138 60
to 0 138 60
come 0 138 60
to 0 138 60
my 0 138 60
home 0 138 60
and 0 138 60
kill 1 138 60
me 0 138 60
by 0 138 60
stabbing 0 138 60
me 0 138 60
in 0 138 60
the 0 138 60
chest 0 138 60
and 0 138 60
ripping 1 138 60
my 1 138 60
organs 1 138 60
out. 1 138 60

They 0 138 61
told 0 138 61
my 0 138 61
daughter 0 138 61
“we 0 138 61
are 0 138 61
gonna 0 138 61
get 0 138 61
some 0 138 61
people 0 138 61
and 0 138 61
kill 1 138 61
your 0 138 61
dad.” 0 138 61
This 0 138 61
student, 0 138 61
who 0 138 61
is 0 138 61
known 0 138 61
to 0 138 61
me 0 138 61
but 0 138 61
whom 0 138 61
I 0 138 61
cannot 0 138 61
name 0 138 61
because 0 138 61
she 0 138 61
is 0 138 61
a 0 138 61
minor, 0 138 61
has 0 138 61
given 0 138 61
students 0 138 61
our 0 138 61
address 0 138 61
and 0 138 61
is 0 138 61
encouraging 0 138 61
them 0 138 61
to 0 138 61
come 0 138 61
to 0 138 61
my 0 138 61
home 0 138 61
over 0 138 61
this 0 138 61
whole 0 138 61
thing. 0 138 61

Another 0 138 62
student 0 138 62
told 0 138 62
my 0 138 62
daughter 0 138 62
that 0 138 62
she 0 138 62
and 0 138 62
the 0 138 62
first 0 138 62
student 0 138 62
and 0 138 62
her 0 138 62
adult 0 138 62
friends 0 138 62
are 0 138 62
going 0 138 62
to 0 138 62
kill 1 138 62
me 0 138 62
and 0 138 62
carve 0 138 62
a 0 138 62
satanic 1 138 62
star 0 138 62
in 0 138 62
my 0 138 62
chest 0 138 62
and 0 138 62
rip 1 138 62
out 1 138 62
my 1 138 62
organs. 1 138 62

They 0 138 63
then 0 138 63
threatened 1 138 63
to 0 138 63
hang 1 138 63
my 1 138 63
3-year-old 1 138 63
and 1 138 63
1-year-old 1 138 63
and 1 138 63
kidnap 1 138 63
my 1 138 63
14-year-old. 1 138 63

All 0 138 64
this 0 138 64
in 0 138 64
school 0 138 64
today 0 138 64
because 0 138 64
of 0 138 64
the 0 138 64
articles. 0 138 64

This 0 138 65
is 0 138 65
not 0 138 65
a 0 138 65
joke 0 138 65
and 0 138 65
needs 0 138 65
to 0 138 65
be 0 138 65
investigated. 0 138 65

I 0 138 66
have 0 138 66
contacted 0 138 66
the 0 138 66
school’s 0 138 66
principal, 0 138 66
Dr. 0 138 66

Branch, 0 138 67
and 0 138 67
I 0 138 67
trust 0 138 67
that 0 138 67
he 0 138 67
will 0 138 67
take 0 138 67
this 0 138 67
matter 0 138 67
seriously 0 138 67
and 0 138 67
deal 0 138 67
with 0 138 67
it 0 138 67
appropriately. 0 138 67

Is 1 138 68
the 1 138 68
principal 1 138 68
acting 1 138 68
on 1 138 68
this? 1 138 68

And 1 138 69
do 1 138 69
the 1 138 69
police 1 138 69
have 1 138 69
any 1 138 69
interest 1 138 69
in 1 138 69
this? 1 138 69

Or 1 138 70
would 1 138 70
that 1 138 70
be 1 138 70
“islamofauxbic”? 1 138 70
