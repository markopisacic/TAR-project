Could 1 63 0
MUTATE 1 63 0

It 1 63 0

The 0 63 1
pneumonic 0 63 1
plague 0 63 1
has 0 63 1
already 0 63 1
infected 0 63 1
2,000 0 63 1
in 0 63 1
Madagascar 0 63 1
and 0 63 1
killed 0 63 1
143 0 63 1
in 0 63 1
the 0 63 1
country’s 0 63 1
worst 0 63 1
outbreak 0 63 1
in 0 63 1
50 0 63 1
years. 0 63 1

But 0 63 2
health 0 63 2
officials 0 63 2
are 0 63 2
now 0 63 2
warning 0 63 2
the 1 63 2
deadly 1 63 2
bacteria 1 63 2
could 1 63 2
mutate 1 63 2
and 1 63 2
become 1 63 2
untreatable 1 63 2
as 0 63 2
it 0 63 2
spreads 0 63 2
across 0 63 2
the 0 63 2
globe. 0 63 2

Coupled 0 63 3
with 0 63 3
the 0 63 3
high 0 63 3
likelihood 0 63 3
that 0 63 3
this 0 63 3
disease 0 63 3
could 0 63 3
spread 0 63 3
globally 0 63 3
by 0 63 3
an 0 63 3
infected 0 63 3
traveler 0 63 3
getting 0 63 3
on 0 63 3
a 0 63 3
plane 0 63 3
to 0 63 3
Europe 0 63 3
or 0 63 3
America, 0 63 3
health 0 63 3
officials 0 63 3
are 0 63 3
now 0 63 3
warning 0 63 3
that 0 63 3
the 0 63 3
strain 0 63 3
of 0 63 3
plague 0 63 3
which 0 63 3
has 0 63 3
already 0 63 3
killed 0 63 3
more 0 63 3
than 0 63 3
140 0 63 3
Madagascar 0 63 3
could 1 63 3
mutate 1 63 3
and 1 63 3
become 1 63 3

Professor 0 63 4
Paul 0 63 4
Hunter 0 63 4
has 0 63 4
warned 0 63 4
that, 0 63 4
while 0 63 4
it 0 63 4
would 0 63 4
be 0 63 4
rather 0 63 4
easy 0 63 4
for 0 63 4
an 0 63 4
advanced 0 63 4
country 0 63 4
to 0 63 4
contain 0 63 4
the 0 63 4
disease 0 63 4
in 0 63 4
its 0 63 4
current 0 63 4
form, 0 63 4
he 1 63 4
fears 1 63 4
that 1 63 4
it 1 63 4
could 1 63 4
evolve 1 63 4
into 1 63 4
something 1 63 4
far 1 63 4
more 1 63 4
dangerous. 1 63 4

Hunter, 0 63 5
who 0 63 5
is 0 63 5
a 0 63 5
disease 0 63 5
expert 0 63 5
at 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
University 0 63 5
of 0 63 5
East 0 63 5
Anglia, 0 63 5
told 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
Daily 0 63 5
Star: 0 63 5
“If 0 63 5
it 0 63 5
reaches 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
UK, 0 63 5
Europe 0 63 5
or 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
US 0 63 5
it 0 63 5
would 0 63 5
be 0 63 5
similar 0 63 5
to 0 63 5
the 0 63 5
Ebola 0 63 5
outbreak. 0 63 5

We 0 63 6
would 0 63 6
have 0 63 6
a 0 63 6
few 0 63 6
isolated 0 63 6
cases 0 63 6
but 0 63 6
it 0 63 6
shouldn’t 0 63 6
spread 0 63 6
like 0 63 6
it 0 63 6
has 0 63 6
in 0 63 6
Madagascar.” 0 63 6
But 0 63 6
he 0 63 6
had 0 63 6
more 0 63 6
to 0 63 6
add. 0 63 6

“As 0 63 7
with 0 63 7
any 0 63 7
disease, 0 63 7
it’s 1 63 7
a 1 63 7
real 1 63 7
worry 1 63 7
that 1 63 7
it 1 63 7
mutates 1 63 7
and 1 63 7
become 1 63 7
untreatable,” 1 63 7
Hunter 0 63 7
said. 0 63 7

So 0 63 8
far, 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
majority 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
recent 0 63 8
cases 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
black 0 63 8
death 0 63 8
have 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
been 0 63 8
pneumonic 0 63 8
plague, 0 63 8
a 0 63 8
more 0 63 8
deadly 0 63 8
form 0 63 8
of 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
bubonic 0 63 8
plague 0 63 8
which 0 63 8
devastated 1 63 8
Europe’s 0 63 8
population 0 63 8
in 0 63 8
the 0 63 8
1300s. 0 63 8

While 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
bubonic 0 63 9
plague 0 63 9
is 0 63 9
spread 0 63 9
through 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
bites 0 63 9
of 0 63 9
infected 0 63 9
fleas, 0 63 9
pneumonic 0 63 9
plague 0 63 9
is 0 63 9
spread 0 63 9
through 0 63 9
the 0 63 9
air, 0 63 9
usually 0 63 9
by 0 63 9
coughing. 0 63 9

Airborne 0 63 10
infections 0 63 10
are 0 63 10
difficult 1 63 10
at 1 63 10
best 1 63 10
to 0 63 10
control. 0 63 10

Symptoms 0 63 11
of 0 63 11
the 0 63 11
plague 0 63 11
include 0 63 11
a 0 63 11
very 0 63 11
high 0 63 11
fever, 0 63 11
coughing 0 63 11
(potentially 0 63 11
coughing 0 63 11
up 0 63 11
blood), 0 63 11
and 0 63 11
headaches. 0 63 11

Ten 0 63 12
African 0 63 12
nations 0 63 12
have 0 63 12
already 1 63 12
been 1 63 12
put 1 63 12
on 1 63 12
alert 1 63 12
that 0 63 12
the 0 63 12
plague 0 63 12
could 0 63 12
easily 0 63 12
spread 0 63 12
to 0 63 12
their 0 63 12
region 0 63 12
of 0 63 12
the 0 63 12
globe. 0 63 12

The 0 63 13
plague 0 63 13
can 0 63 13
be 0 63 13
fatal 0 63 13
24-48 0 63 13
hours 0 63 13
after 0 63 13
infection, 0 63 13
but 0 63 13
antibiotics 0 63 13
will 0 63 13
take 0 63 13
care 0 63 13
of 0 63 13
the 0 63 13
infection. 0 63 13

Schools 0 63 14
and 0 63 14
universities 0 63 14
have 0 63 14
been 0 63 14
closed 0 63 14
with 0 63 14
a 0 63 14
ban 0 63 14
issued 0 63 14
on 0 63 14
public 0 63 14
gatherings, 0 63 14
such 0 63 14
as 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
tradition 0 63 14
of 0 63 14
“dancing 0 63 14
with 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
dead” 0 63 14
which 0 63 14
has 0 63 14
been 0 63 14
partially 0 63 14
blamed 0 63 14
for 0 63 14
the 0 63 14
disease’s 0 63 14
spread. 0 63 14
