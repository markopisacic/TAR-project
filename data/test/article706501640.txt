The 0 169 1
pneumonic 0 169 1
plague 0 169 1
has 0 169 1
already 0 169 1
infected 0 169 1
2,000 0 169 1

Madagascar 0 169 1
and 0 169 1

in 0 169 1
50 0 169 1

But 0 169 2

now 0 169 2
warning 0 169 2
the 1 169 2

it 0 169 2
spreads 0 169 2
across 0 169 2
the 0 169 2
globe. 0 169 2

Coupled 0 169 3
with 0 169 3
the 0 169 3
high 0 169 3
likelihood 0 169 3
that 0 169 3
this 0 169 3

Professor 0 169 4
Paul 0 169 4
Hunter 0 169 4
has 0 169 4
warned 0 169 4
that, 0 169 4
while 0 169 4
it 0 169 4
would 0 169 4
be 0 169 4
rather 0 169 4
easy 0 169 4
for 0 169 4
an 0 169 4
advanced 0 169 4
country 0 169 4
to 0 169 4
contain 0 169 4
the 0 169 4
disease 0 169 4
in 0 169 4
its 0 169 4
current 0 169 4
form, 0 169 4
he 1 169 4
fears 1 169 4
that 1 169 4
it 1 169 4
could 1 169 4
evolve 1 169 4
into 1 169 4
something 1 169 4
far 1 169 4
more 1 169 4
dangerous. 1 169 4

Hunter, 0 169 5
who 0 169 5
is 0 169 5
a 0 169 5
disease 0 169 5
expert 0 169 5
at 0 169 5
the 0 169 5
University 0 169 5
of 0 169 5
East 0 169 5
Anglia, 0 169 5
told 0 169 5
the 0 169 5
Daily 0 169 5
Star: 0 169 5
“If 0 169 5
it 0 169 5
reaches 0 169 5
the 0 169 5
UK, 0 169 5
Europe 0 169 5
or 0 169 5
the 0 169 5
US 0 169 5
it 0 169 5
would 0 169 5
be 0 169 5
similar 0 169 5
to 0 169 5
the 0 169 5
Ebola 0 169 5
outbreak. 0 169 5

We 0 169 6
would 0 169 6
have 0 169 6
a 0 169 6
few 0 169 6
isolated 0 169 6
cases 0 169 6
but 0 169 6
it 0 169 6
shouldn’t 0 169 6
spread 0 169 6
like 0 169 6
it 0 169 6
has 0 169 6
in 0 169 6
Madagascar.” 0 169 6
But 0 169 6
he 0 169 6
had 0 169 6
more 0 169 6
to 0 169 6
add. 0 169 6

“As 0 169 7
with 0 169 7
any 0 169 7
disease, 0 169 7
it’s 1 169 7
a 1 169 7
real 1 169 7
worry 1 169 7
that 1 169 7
it 1 169 7
mutates 1 169 7
and 1 169 7
become 1 169 7
untreatable,” 1 169 7
Hunter 0 169 7
said. 0 169 7

So 0 169 8
far, 0 169 8
the 0 169 8
majority 0 169 8
of 0 169 8
the 0 169 8
recent 0 169 8
cases 0 169 8
of 0 169 8
the 0 169 8
black 0 169 8
death 0 169 8
have 0 169 8
the 0 169 8
been 0 169 8
pneumonic 0 169 8
plague, 0 169 8
a 0 169 8
more 0 169 8
deadly 0 169 8
form 0 169 8
of 0 169 8
the 0 169 8
bubonic 0 169 8
plague 0 169 8
which 0 169 8
devastated 1 169 8
Europe’s 0 169 8
population 0 169 8
in 0 169 8
the 0 169 8
1300s. 0 169 8

While 0 169 9
the 0 169 9
bubonic 0 169 9
plague 0 169 9
is 0 169 9
spread 0 169 9
through 0 169 9
the 0 169 9
bites 0 169 9
of 0 169 9
infected 0 169 9
fleas, 0 169 9
pneumonic 0 169 9
plague 0 169 9
is 0 169 9
spread 0 169 9
through 0 169 9
the 0 169 9
air, 0 169 9
usually 0 169 9
by 0 169 9
coughing. 0 169 9

Airborne 0 169 10
infections 0 169 10
are 0 169 10
difficult 1 169 10
at 1 169 10
best 1 169 10
to 0 169 10
control. 0 169 10

Symptoms 0 169 11
of 0 169 11
the 0 169 11
plague 0 169 11
include 0 169 11
a 0 169 11
very 0 169 11
high 0 169 11
fever, 0 169 11
coughing 0 169 11
(potentially 0 169 11
coughing 0 169 11
up 0 169 11
blood), 0 169 11
and 0 169 11
headaches. 0 169 11

Ten 0 169 12
African 0 169 12
nations 0 169 12
have 0 169 12
already 1 169 12
been 1 169 12
put 1 169 12
on 1 169 12
alert 1 169 12
that 0 169 12
the 0 169 12
plague 0 169 12
could 0 169 12
easily 0 169 12
spread 0 169 12
to 0 169 12
their 0 169 12
region 0 169 12
of 0 169 12
the 0 169 12
globe. 0 169 12

The 0 169 13
plague 0 169 13
can 0 169 13
be 0 169 13
fatal 0 169 13
24-48 0 169 13
hours 0 169 13
after 0 169 13
infection, 0 169 13
but 0 169 13
antibiotics 0 169 13
will 0 169 13
take 0 169 13
care 0 169 13
of 0 169 13
the 0 169 13
infection. 0 169 13

Schools 0 169 14
and 0 169 14
universities 0 169 14
have 0 169 14
been 0 169 14
closed 0 169 14
with 0 169 14
a 0 169 14
ban 0 169 14
issued 0 169 14
on 0 169 14
public 0 169 14
gatherings, 0 169 14
such 0 169 14
as 0 169 14

tradition 0 169 14
of 0 169 14
“dancing 0 169 14
with 0 169 14
the 0 169 14
dead” 0 169 14
which 0 169 14
has 0 169 14
been 0 169 14
partially 0 169 14
blamed 0 169 14
for 0 169 14
the 0 169 14
disease’s 0 169 14
spread. 0 169 14

The 0 169 15
current 0 169 15
outbreak 0 169 15
is 0 169 15
also 0 169 15
highly 0 169 15

as 0 169 15
it 0 169 15
has 0 169 15
affected 0 169 15
urban 0 169 15

according 0 169 15
