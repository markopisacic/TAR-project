The 0
pneumonic 0

has 0
already 0
infected 0
2,000 0
in 0
Madagascar 0
and 0
killed 0
143 0
in 0
the 0
country’s 0
worst 0

in 0

But 0
health 0
officials 0
are 0
now 0
warning 0
the 1
deadly 1
bacteria 1
could 1
mutate 1

as 0

Coupled 0
with 0
the 0
high 0
likelihood 0
that 0
this 0
disease 0
could 0
spread 0
globally 0
by 0
an 0
infected 0
traveler 0
getting 0
on 0
a 0

to 0
Europe 0
or 0
America, 0
health 0
officials 0
are 0
now 0
warning 0
that 0
the 0
strain 0
of 0
plague 0
which 0
has 0

more 0

Professor 0
Paul 0
Hunter 0
has 0
warned 0
that, 0
while 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
rather 0
easy 0
for 0
an 0
advanced 0
country 0
to 0
contain 0
the 0
disease 0
in 0
its 0
current 0
form, 0
he 1
fears 1
that 1
it 1
could 1
evolve 1
into 1
something 1
far 1
more 1
dangerous. 1

Hunter, 0
who 0
is 0
a 0
disease 0
expert 0
at 0
the 0
University 0
of 0
East 0
Anglia, 0
told 0
the 0
Daily 0
Star: 0
“If 0
it 0
reaches 0
the 0
UK, 0
Europe 0
or 0
the 0
US 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
similar 0
to 0
the 0
Ebola 0
outbreak. 0

We 0
would 0
have 0
a 0
few 0
isolated 0
cases 0
but 0
it 0
shouldn’t 0
spread 0
like 0
it 0
has 0
in 0
Madagascar.” 0
But 0
he 0
had 0
more 0
to 0
add. 0

“As 0
with 0
any 0
disease, 0
it’s 1
a 1
real 1
worry 1
that 1
it 1
mutates 1
and 1
become 1
untreatable,” 1
Hunter 0
said. 0

So 0
far, 0
the 0
majority 0
of 0
the 0
recent 0
cases 0
of 0
the 0
black 0
death 0
have 0
the 0
been 0
pneumonic 0
plague, 0
a 0
more 0
deadly 0
form 0
of 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
which 0
devastated 1
Europe’s 0
population 0
in 0
the 0
1300s. 0

While 0
the 0
bubonic 0
plague 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
bites 0
of 0
infected 0
fleas, 0
pneumonic 0
plague 0
is 0
spread 0
through 0
the 0
air, 0
usually 0
by 0
coughing. 0

Airborne 0
infections 0
are 0
difficult 1
at 1
best 1
to 0
control. 0

Symptoms 0
of 0
the 0
plague 0
include 0
a 0
very 0
high 0
fever, 0
coughing 0
(potentially 0
coughing 0
up 0
blood), 0
and 0
headaches. 0

Ten 0
African 0
nations 0
have 0
already 1
been 1
put 1
on 1
alert 1
that 0
the 0
plague 0
could 0
easily 0
spread 0
to 0
their 0
region 0
of 0
the 0
globe. 0

The 0
plague 0
can 0
be 0
fatal 0
24-48 0
hours 0
after 0
infection, 0
but 0
antibiotics 0
will 0
take 0
care 0
of 0
the 0
infection. 0

Schools 0
and 0
universities 0
have 0
been 0
closed 0
with 0
a 0
ban 0
issued 0
on 0
public 0
gatherings, 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
tradition 0
of 0
“dancing 0
with 0
the 0
dead” 0
which 0
has 0
been 0
partially 0
blamed 0
for 0
the 0
disease’s 0
spread. 0

The 0
current 0
outbreak 0
is 0
also 0
highly 0
unusual 0
as 0
it 0
has 0
affected 0
urban 0
areas 0
increasing 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
transmission, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
