“This 0 435 8

Kelly 0 435 8
said. 0 435 8

But 0 435 9
Kelly 0 435 9
said 0 435 9
he 0 435 9
hasn’t 0 435 9
considered 0 435 9
at 0 435 9
all 0 435 9

More 0 435 10
arguments 0 435 10
are 0 435 10

“I 0 435 11

What? 0 435 12

Due 0 435 13
process? 0 435 13

Wait, 0 435 14
Acosta 0 435 14
was 0 435 14
not 0 435 14
charged 0 435 14
with 0 435 14

being 0 435 30
brought 0 435 30

This 0 435 31
is 0 435 31
an 0 435 31
issue 0 435 31
of 0 435 31
privilege, 0 435 31

I 0 435 32

point 0 435 32
before 0 435 32

this 0 435 32
judge 0 435 32
apparently 0 435 32
doesn't 0 435 32
get 0 435 32
it. 0 435 32

I 0 435 33
want 0 435 33
my 0 435 33
White 0 435 33
House 0 435 33
press 0 435 33
pass! 0 435 33

So 0 435 34
does 0 435 34
Infowars. 0 435 34

Will 0 435 35
Judge 0 435 35
Kelly 0 435 35
demand 0 435 35
the 0 435 35
White 0 435 35

provide 0 435 35
us 0 435 35
with 0 435 35
one 0 435 35
as 0 435 35
a 0 435 35
"right"? 0 435 35

Nope, 0 435 36
not 0 435 36
gonna 0 435 36
happen. 0 435 36

Because 0 435 37
it's 0 435 37
not 0 435 37
a 0 435 37
right. 0 435 37

Yet, 0 435 38
this 0 435 38
judge 0 435 38
orders 0 435 38
the 0 435 38
White 0 435 38

to 0 435 38
restore 0 435 38

Give 0 435 39
me 0 435 39
a 0 435 39

Acosta's 0 435 40

Amendment 0 435 40

weren't 0 435 40

either. 0 435 40

Furthermore, 0 435 41
the 0 435 41
White 0 435 41

did 0 435 41
say 0 435 41

White 0 435 53
House 0 435 53

writing 0 435 53
up, 0 435 53
Trump 0 435 53
added, 0 435 53
"We’re 1 435 53
writing 1 435 53
them 1 435 53
now. 1 435 53

We’ll 0 435 54
have 0 435 54
rules 0 435 54
of 0 435 54
decorum, 0 435 54
you 0 435 54
know 0 435 54
you 0 435 54
can’t 0 435 54
keep 0 435 54
asking 0 435 54
questions. 0 435 54

We 0 435 55
had 0 435 55
a 0 435 55
lot 0 435 55
of 0 435 55
reporters 0 435 55
in 0 435 55
that 0 435 55
room, 0 435 55
many 1 435 55
many 1 435 55
reporters 1 435 55
in 0 435 55
that 0 435 55
room 0 435 55
and 0 435 55
they 0 435 55
were 0 435 55
unable 0 435 55
to 0 435 55
ask 0 435 55
questions 0 435 55
because 0 435 55
this 0 435 55
guy 0 435 55
gets 0 435 55
up 0 435 55
and 0 435 55
starts, 0 435 55
you 0 435 55
know, 0 435 55
doing 0 435 55
what 0 435 55
he’s 0 435 55
supposed 0 435 55
to 0 435 55
be 0 435 55
doing 0 435 55
for 0 435 55
him 0 435 55
and 0 435 55
for 0 435 55
CNN 0 435 55
and 0 435 55
you 0 435 55
know 0 435 55
just 0 435 55
shouting 0 435 55
out 0 435 55
questions 0 435 55
and 0 435 55
making 0 435 55
statements, 0 435 55
too." 0 435 55

You 0 435 56
know 0 435 56
that 0 435 56
isn't 0 435 56
going 0 435 56
to 0 435 56
stop 0 435 56
someone 0 435 56
like 0 435 56
Acosta, 0 435 56
who 0 435 56
claimed 0 435 56
to 0 435 56
deal 0 435 56
in 0 435 56
facts 0 435 56
and 0 435 56
truth, 0 435 56
but 0 435 56
clearly 0 435 56
demonstrated 0 435 56
he 0 435 56
was 0 435 56
all 1 435 56
about 1 435 56
lies 1 435 56
when 0 435 56
it 0 435 56
came 0 435 56
to 0 435 56
putting 0 435 56
his 0 435 56
hands 0 435 56
on 0 435 56
a 0 435 56
White 0 435 56
House 0 435 56

The 0 435 57
order 0 435 57
by 0 435 57
Judge 0 435 57
Kelly 0 435 57
is 0 435 57
a 0 435 57
temporary 0 435 57
one 0 435 57
that 0 435 57
lasts 0 435 57
for 0 435 57
14 0 435 57
days. 0 435 57

“I 0 435 58
will 0 435 58
say 0 435 58
this, 0 435 58
look, 0 435 58
nobody 1 435 58
believes 1 435 58
in 1 435 58
the 1 435 58
First 1 435 58
Amendment 1 435 58
more 1 435 58
than 1 435 58
I 1 435 58
do 1 435 58
and 0 435 58
if 0 435 58
I 0 435 58
think 0 435 58
somebody 0 435 58
is 0 435 58
acting 0 435 58
out 0 435 58
of 0 435 58
sorts 0 435 58
I 0 435 58
will 0 435 58
leave," 0 435 58
Trump 0 435 58
continued. 0 435 58

"I 0 435 59
will 0 435 59
say 0 435 59
thank 0 435 59
you 0 435 59
very 0 435 59
much 0 435 59
everybody, 0 435 59
I 0 435 59
appreciate 0 435 59
you 0 435 59
coming 0 435 59
and 0 435 59
I’ll 0 435 59
leave. 0 435 59

And 0 435 60
those 0 435 60
reporters 0 435 60
will 0 435 60
not 0 435 60
be 0 435 60
too 0 435 60
friendly 0 435 60
to 0 435 60
whoever 0 435 60
it 0 435 60
is 0 435 60
that’s 0 435 60
acting 0 435 60
up.” 0 435 60

White 0 435 61
House 0 435 61
Press 0 435 61
Secretary 0 435 61
Sarah 0 435 61
Sanders 0 435 61
issued 0 435 61
a 0 435 61
statement 0 435 61
following 0 435 61
the 0 435 61
judge's 0 435 61
ruling 0 435 61
on 0 435 61
Thursday. 0 435 61

“Today, 0 435 62
the 0 435 62
court 0 435 62
made 0 435 62
clear 0 435 62
that 0 435 62
there 0 435 62
is 0 435 62
no 0 435 62
absolute 0 435 62
First 0 435 62
Amendment 0 435 62
right 0 435 62
to 0 435 62
access 0 435 62
the 0 435 62
White 0 435 62
House. 0 435 62

In 0 435 63
response 0 435 63
to 0 435 63
the 0 435 63
court, 0 435 63
we 0 435 63
will 0 435 63
temporarily 0 435 63
reinstate 0 435 63
the 0 435 63
reporter’s 0 435 63
hard 0 435 63
pass. 0 435 63

We 0 435 64
will 0 435 64
also 0 435 64
further 0 435 64
develop 0 435 64
rules 0 435 64
and 0 435 64
processes 0 435 64
to 0 435 64
ensure 0 435 64
fair 0 435 64
and 0 435 64
orderly 0 435 64
press 0 435 64
conferences 0 435 64
in 0 435 64
the 0 435 64
future. 0 435 64

There 0 435 65
must 0 435 65
be 0 435 65
decorum 0 435 65
at 0 435 65
the 0 435 65
White 0 435 65
House.” 0 435 65

Well, 0 435 66
I 0 435 66
can't 0 435 66
wait 0 435 66
to 0 435 66
see 0 435 66
the 0 435 66
next 0 435 66
press 0 435 66
conference. 0 435 66

Perhaps 0 435 67
there 0 435 67
is 0 435 67
an 0 435 67
easier 0 435 67
way 0 435 67
around 0 435 67
all 0 435 67
of 0 435 67
this. 0 435 67

Perhaps 0 435 68
from 0 435 68
now 0 435 68
on, 0 435 68
President 0 435 68
Trump 0 435 68
should 0 435 68
ignore 0 435 68
Jim 0 435 68
Acosta 0 435 68
and 0 435 68
take 0 435 68
anyone 1 435 68
and 1 435 68
everyone 1 435 68
else's 0 435 68
questions 0 435 68
in 0 435 68
the 0 435 68
room 0 435 68
but 0 435 68
his 0 435 68
questions. 0 435 68

See 0 435 68

how 0 435 68

he 0 435 68

likes 0 435 68

them 0 435 68

apples. 0 435 68
