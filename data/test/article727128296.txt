But 0
Haig 0
says 0
he 0
had 0
no 0
idea 0
what 0
Paddock 0
was 0
planning 0
to 0
do 0
when 0
he 0
met 0
him 0
just 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
before 0
the 0
massacre. 0

Haig 0
says 0
he 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
720 0
rounds 0
of 0
ammunition 0
from 0
Haig's 0
home 0
gun 0
business. 0

"I 0
couldn't 0
detect 0
anything 0
wrong 0
with 0
this 0
guy," 0
he 0
said. 0

"He 0
told 0
me 0
exactly 0
what 0
he 0
wanted. 0

I 0
handed 0
him 0
a 0
box 0
with 0
the 0
ammunition 0
in 0
it, 0
and 0
he 0
paid 0
me 0
and 0
he 0
left." 0

The 0
rounds 0
he 0
sold 0
are 0
called 0
"tracer 0
ammunition" 0
– 0
bullets 0
that 0
leave 0
a 0
visible 0
trail 0
when 0
fired. 0

"He 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
going 0
to 0
go 0
put 0
on 0
a 0
light 0
show. 0

And 0
I 0
can't 0
remember 0
whether 0
he 0
said 0
for 0
or 0
with 0
his 0
friends, 0
but 0
that's 0
what 0
he 0
did 0
say," 0

"may 0
have 0
conspired 0
with 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
to 0
commit 0
murder 0
with 0
a 0
deadly 0
weapon." 0

Haig 0
strongly 0
denies 0
that. 0

"I 0
felt 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
hoping 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
find 0
a 0
connection 0
between 0
myself 0
and 0
Paddock, 0
that 0
would 0
go 0
back 0
showing 0
that 0
I 0
supplied 0
him 0
with 0
most 0
of 0
his 0
ammunition, 0
possibly 0
even 0
some 0
firearms," 0
Haig 0
said. 0

"They're 0
not 0
gonna 0
find 0
it. 0

I 0
talked 0
to 0
the 0
guy 0
three 0
times." 0

It's 0
unclear 0
whether 0
Haig 0
is 0
still 0
a 0

blame 0
himself, 0
but 0
within 0

of 0

still 0
decided 0
to 0
shut 0
down 0
his 0
business. 0

"I'm 0
still 0
racking 1
my 1
