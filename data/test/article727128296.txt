But 0 128 7
Haig 0 128 7
says 0 128 7
he 0 128 7
had 0 128 7
no 0 128 7
idea 0 128 7

he 0 128 7
met 0 128 7
him 0 128 7
just 0 128 7
a 0 128 7
few 0 128 7
weeks 0 128 7
before 0 128 7
the 0 128 7
massacre. 0 128 7

Haig 0 128 8
says 0 128 8
he 0 128 8
sold 0 128 8
Paddock 0 128 8
720 0 128 8
rounds 0 128 8
of 0 128 8
ammunition 0 128 8
from 0 128 8
Haig's 0 128 8

"I 0 128 9
couldn't 0 128 9
detect 0 128 9
anything 0 128 9
wrong 0 128 9
with 0 128 9
this 0 128 9
guy," 0 128 9
he 0 128 9
said. 0 128 9

"He 0 128 10
told 0 128 10
me 0 128 10
exactly 0 128 10
what 0 128 10
he 0 128 10
wanted. 0 128 10

I 0 128 11
handed 0 128 11
him 0 128 11
a 0 128 11
box 0 128 11
with 0 128 11
the 0 128 11
ammunition 0 128 11
in 0 128 11
it, 0 128 11

he 0 128 11
paid 0 128 11
me 0 128 11
and 0 128 11
he 0 128 11
left." 0 128 11

The 0 128 12
rounds 0 128 12
he 0 128 12
sold 0 128 12
are 0 128 12
called 0 128 12
"tracer 0 128 12
ammunition" 0 128 12
– 0 128 12
bullets 0 128 12
that 0 128 12
leave 0 128 12
a 0 128 12
visible 0 128 12
trail 0 128 12
when 0 128 12
fired. 0 128 12

"He 0 128 13

he 0 128 13
was 0 128 13
going 0 128 13
to 0 128 13

And 0 128 14
I 0 128 14
can't 0 128 14
remember 0 128 14
whether 0 128 14
he 0 128 14
said 0 128 14
for 0 128 14
or 0 128 14
with 0 128 14
his 0 128 14
friends, 0 128 14
but 0 128 14
that's 0 128 14
what 0 128 14
he 0 128 14
did 0 128 14
say," 0 128 14

"may 0 128 15
have 0 128 15

Haig 0 128 16
strongly 0 128 16
denies 0 128 16
that. 0 128 16

"I 0 128 17
felt 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
they 0 128 17
were 0 128 17
hoping 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
they 0 128 17
could 0 128 17
find 0 128 17
a 0 128 17
connection 0 128 17
between 0 128 17
myself 0 128 17
and 0 128 17
Paddock, 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
would 0 128 17
go 0 128 17
back 0 128 17
showing 0 128 17
that 0 128 17
I 0 128 17
supplied 0 128 17
him 0 128 17
with 0 128 17
most 0 128 17
of 0 128 17
his 0 128 17
ammunition, 0 128 17
possibly 0 128 17
even 0 128 17
some 0 128 17
firearms," 0 128 17
Haig 0 128 17
said. 0 128 17

"They're 0 128 18
not 0 128 18
gonna 0 128 18
find 0 128 18
it. 0 128 18

I 0 128 19

three 0 128 19

It's 0 128 20
unclear 0 128 20

a 0 128 20

within 0 128 23

of 0 128 23
