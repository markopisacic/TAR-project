The 0 125 1
incident 0 125 1
was 0 125 1
brief: 0 125 1
on 0 125 1
the 0 125 1
Thursday 0 125 1
of 0 125 1
the 0 125 1
pope’s 0 125 1
week-long 0 125 1

in 0 125 1
response 0 125 1
to 0 125 1
an 0 125 1
impromptu 0 125 1
question 0 125 1
tossed 1 125 1
out 1 125 1
by 0 125 1
a 0 125 1
Chilean 0 125 1
reporter, 0 125 1
the 0 125 1
pope 0 125 1
responded 0 125 1
in 0 125 1
what 0 125 1
one 0 125 1
reporter 0 125 1
described 0 125 1
as 0 125 1
a 0 125 1
“snippy 1 125 1
tone”: 1 125 1
“The 0 125 1
day 0 125 1
I 0 125 1
see 0 125 1
proof 0 125 1
against 0 125 1
Bishop 0 125 1
Barros, 0 125 1
then 0 125 1
I 0 125 1
will 0 125 1
talk. 0 125 1

There 0 125 2
is 0 125 2
not 0 125 2
a 0 125 2
single 0 125 2
piece 0 125 2
of 0 125 2
evidence 0 125 2
against 0 125 2
him. 0 125 2

It 0 125 3
is 0 125 3
all 0 125 3
calumny. 0 125 3

Is 0 125 4
that 0 125 4
clear?” 0 125 4

This 0 125 5
month 0 125 5
has 0 125 5
been 0 125 5
quite 0 125 5
a 0 125 5
spectacle, 0 125 5
even 0 125 5
for 0 125 5
this 0 125 5
pontificate; 0 125 5
an 0 125 5
apparently 0 125 5
unending 1 125 5
stream 1 125 5
of 1 125 5
outrages 1 125 5
and 1 125 5
embarrassments, 1 125 5
with 0 125 5
the 0 125 5
pope 0 125 5
and 0 125 5
his 0 125 5
Vatican 0 125 5
media 0 125 5

jumping 0 125 5
from 0 125 5
one 0 125 5
scandal 0 125 5
to 0 125 5
the 0 125 5
next. 0 125 5

But 0 125 6
among 0 125 6
secular 0 125 6
reporters 0 125 6
the 0 125 6
sex 0 125 6
abuse 0 125 6
issue 0 125 6
trumps 0 125 6
all 0 125 6
others 0 125 6
and 0 125 6
the 0 125 6
fallout 0 125 6
continues 0 125 6
to 1 125 6
blaze 1 125 6
down 1 125 6
on 0 125 6
the 0 125 6
Bergoglian 0 125 6
pontificate 0 125 6
in 0 125 6
response 0 125 6
to 0 125 6
his 0 125 6
amazing 0 125 6
accusation 0 125 6
earlier 0 125 6
this 0 125 6
month 0 125 6
that 0 125 6
victims 0 125 6
of 0 125 6
sexual 0 125 6
abuse 0 125 6
by 0 125 6
clergy 0 125 6
were 0 125 6
engaging 0 125 6
in 0 125 6
“calumny,” 0 125 6
in 0 125 6
their 0 125 6
accusations 0 125 6
against 0 125 6

It 0 125 7
seems 0 125 7
the 0 125 7
shine 0 125 7
is 0 125 7
coming 0 125 7
off 0 125 7
the 0 125 7
papal 0 125 7

it 0 125 9
gets 0 125 9
worse 0 125 9
than 0 125 9
this. 0 125 9

“These 0 125 14

are 0 125 14
at 0 125 14
the 0 125 14
least 0 125 14
shameful. 0 125 14

At 0 125 15
the 0 125 15
most, 0 125 15
they 0 125 15
suggest 0 125 15
that 0 125 15

The 0 125 16

is 0 125 16
all 0 125 16
too 0 125 16
familiar: 0 125 16

“The 0 125 17

exactly 0 125 18
he 0 125 18
believed 0 125 18

second 0 125 19

Barros 0 125 19

the 0 125 19
flight 0 125 19
was 0 125 19
a 0 125 19
Chilean 0 125 19
woman. 0 125 19

As 0 125 20
she 0 125 20
spoke 0 125 20
to 0 125 20
the 0 125 20
pope, 0 125 20
her 1 125 20
voice 1 125 20
cracked 1 125 20
with 1 125 20
nervousness 1 125 20
at 0 125 20
questioning 0 125 20
the 0 125 20
church’s 0 125 20
top 0 125 20
leader. 0 125 20

She 0 125 21
asked: 0 125 21
‘Why 0 125 21
are 0 125 21
not 0 125 21
the 0 125 21
victims’ 0 125 21
testimonies 0 125 21
proof 0 125 21

you? 0 125 21

Why 0 125 22
do 0 125 22
you 0 125 22
not 0 125 22
believe 0 125 22
them?’ 0 125 22
The 0 125 22
pope 0 125 22
gave 0 125 22
no 0 125 22
satisfying 0 125 22
answer, 0 125 22
only 0 125 22
repeating 0 125 22
a 0 125 22
claim 0 125 22
of 0 125 22
‘no 0 125 22
evidence’ 0 125 22
against 0 125 22
the 0 125 22
bishop.” 0 125 22

Indeed, 0 125 23
it 0 125 23
was 0 125 23
understood, 0 125 23
as 0 125 23
the 0 125 23

was 0 125 23
in 0 125 23
part 0 125 23
intended 0 125 23
as 0 125 23
“an 0 125 23
apology 0 125 23
tour” 0 125 23
to 0 125 23
abuse 0 125 23
survivors. 0 125 23

Which 0 125 24
is 0 125 24
why 0 125 24
his 0 125 24
accusation 0 125 24
of 0 125 24
calumny 0 125 24
against 0 125 24
those 0 125 24
same 0 125 24
victims 0 125 24

next 0 125 24
day 0 125 24
came 0 125 24
as 0 125 24
such 0 125 24
a 0 125 24
shock 0 125 24
to 0 125 24
observers 0 125 24
unused 0 125 24
to 0 125 24
Bergoglio’s 0 125 24
ability 0 125 24
to 0 125 24
turn 0 125 24
on 0 125 24
a 0 125 24
dime. 0 125 24

All 0 125 25
was 0 125 25
going 0 125 25
as 0 125 25
planned. 0 125 25

On 0 125 26
Wednesday, 0 125 26

of 0 125 26
sexual 0 125 26
abuse 0 125 26
by 0 125 26
priests. 0 125 26

He 0 125 27
made 0 125 27
all 0 125 27
the 0 125 27
right 0 125 27
noises, 0 125 27
talking 0 125 27
about 0 125 27
his 0 125 27
“pain 0 125 27

shame,” 0 125 27
and 0 125 27
reportedly 0 125 27
even 0 125 27

at 0 125 27
what 0 125 27
happened. 0 125 27

“I 0 125 28

Sorry 0 125 32
Austen, 0 125 32
we 0 125 32
didn’t 0 125 32
think 0 125 32
of 0 125 32
it 0 125 32
as 0 125 32

Barros 0 125 35
claimed 0 125 35
in 0 125 35
court 0 125 35
that 0 125 35
the 0 125 35
first 0 125 35

This 0 125 36
is 0 125 36
refuted 0 125 36
by 0 125 36
Karadima’s 0 125 36
victims 0 125 36
– 0 125 36
deemed 0 125 36

Last 0 125 37
Thursday, 0 125 37
however, 0 125 37
was 0 125 37
not 0 125 37
the 0 125 37
first 0 125 37
time 0 125 37
Francis, 0 125 37
confronted 0 125 37
unexpectedly 0 125 37
in 0 125 37
public 0 125 37
over 0 125 37
the 0 125 37
Barros 0 125 37
question, 0 125 37
has 0 125 37
responded 0 125 37
testily 0 125 37
and 0 125 37
with 0 125 37
insults. 0 125 37

In 0 125 38
2015 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
Italian 0 125 38
newspaper 0 125 38

published 0 125 38
a 0 125 38
video 0 125 38
of 0 125 38
him 0 125 38
scolding 0 125 38
two 0 125 38
women 0 125 38
who 0 125 38
spoke 0 125 38
with 0 125 38
him 0 125 38
in 0 125 38
St. 0 125 38
Peter’s 0 125 38
Piazza, 0 125 38
asking 0 125 38
that 0 125 38
he 0 125 38
reconsider 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
appointment, 0 125 38
citing 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
“suffering” 0 125 38
of 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
Church 0 125 38
in 0 125 38
Chile 0 125 38
over 0 125 38
the 0 125 38
issue. 0 125 38

The 0 125 39
pope 0 125 39
told 0 125 39
the 0 125 39
women, 0 125 39
“The 0 125 39
Church 0 125 39
has 0 125 39
lost 0 125 39
its 0 125 39
freedom, 0 125 39
letting 0 125 39
its 0 125 39
head 0 125 39
fill 0 125 39
with 0 125 39
politicians 0 125 39
and 0 125 39
accusing 0 125 39
a 0 125 39
bishop 0 125 39
without 0 125 39
having 0 125 39
any 0 125 39
proof, 0 125 39
after 0 125 39
twenty 0 125 39
years 0 125 39
of 0 125 39
service, 0 125 39
so 0 125 39
think 1 125 39
with 1 125 39
your 1 125 39
head.” 1 125 39
He 0 125 39
warned 0 125 39
them 0 125 39
not 0 125 39
to 0 125 39
allow 0 125 39
themselves 0 125 39
to 0 125 39
be 0 125 39
led 0 125 39
by 0 125 39
“leftists 1 125 39
who 1 125 39
have 1 125 39
set 1 125 39
up 1 125 39
this 1 125 39
thing.” 1 125 39

“The 0 125 40
only 0 125 40
charge 0 125 40
against 0 125 40
this 0 125 40
bishop 0 125 40
has 0 125 40
been 0 125 40
discredited 0 125 40
by 0 125 40
the 0 125 40
Court 0 125 40
of 0 125 40
Justice, 0 125 40
so 0 125 40
please 0 125 40
do 0 125 40
not 0 125 40
lose 0 125 40
your 0 125 40
serenity, 0 125 40
you 0 125 40
suffer, 0 125 40
but 0 125 40
because 0 125 40
you 1 125 40
are 1 125 40
foolish...I 1 125 40
am 0 125 40
the 0 125 40
first 0 125 40
to 0 125 40
judge 0 125 40

punish 0 125 40
those 0 125 40
accused 0 125 40
of 0 125 40
similar 0 125 40
crimes, 0 125 40
but 0 125 40
in 0 125 40
this 0 125 40
case 0 125 40
there 0 125 40
is 0 125 40
not 0 125 40
even 0 125 40
a 0 125 40
proof.” 0 125 40

The 0 125 41
insults 0 125 41
were 0 125 41
not 0 125 41
forgotten. 0 125 41

Among 0 125 42
the 0 125 42
signs 0 125 42
held 0 125 42
by 0 125 42
protesters 0 125 42
in 0 125 42
Chile 0 125 42
last 0 125 42
week 0 125 42
were 0 125 42
those 0 125 42
reading, 0 125 42
“Ni 0 125 42
zurdos, 0 125 42
ni 0 125 42
tontos,” 0 125 42
(Neither 1 125 42
lefties 1 125 42
nor 1 125 42
stupid). 1 125 42

The 0 125 43
jab 0 125 43
certainly 0 125 43
wasn’t 0 125 43
lost 0 125 43
on 0 125 43
Francis, 0 125 43
since 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
signs 0 125 43
were 0 125 43
being 0 125 43
held 0 125 43
by 0 125 43
protesters 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
full 0 125 43
length 0 125 43
of 0 125 43
his 0 125 43
auto 0 125 43
route 0 125 43
to 0 125 43
Santiago 0 125 43
from 0 125 43
the 0 125 43
airport. 0 125 43

One 0 125 44
of 0 125 44
the 0 125 44
protesters 0 125 44
told 0 125 44
the 0 125 44
BBC, 0 125 44
“He 0 125 44
doesn’t 0 125 44
even 0 125 44
know 0 125 44
us, 0 125 44
so 0 125 44
how 0 125 44
can 0 125 44
he 0 125 44
accuse 0 125 44
us 0 125 44
of 0 125 44
being 0 125 44
such 0 125 44
things? 0 125 44

He 0 125 45
thinks 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
politically 0 125 45
motivated 0 125 45
even 0 125 45
though 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
come 0 125 45
from 0 125 45
different 0 125 45
parishes 0 125 45
in 0 125 45
Osorno 0 125 45
and 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
doing 0 125 45
this 0 125 45
because 0 125 45
we 0 125 45
are 0 125 45
against 0 125 45
priests 0 125 45
being 0 125 45
allowed 0 125 45
to 0 125 45
abuse 0 125 45
children.” 0 125 45

Apparently 0 125 46
His 0 125 46
Holiness 0 125 46
was 0 125 46
informed 0 125 46
that 0 125 46
the 0 125 46
“calumny” 1 125 46
comment 1 125 46
had 0 125 46
caused 0 125 46
some 0 125 46
blow-back 0 125 46
because 0 125 46
a 0 125 46
couple 0 125 46
of 0 125 46
days 0 125 46
later 0 125 46
we 0 125 46
got 0 125 46
something 0 125 46
touted 0 125 46
– 0 125 46
though 0 125 46
somewhat 0 125 46
skeptically 0 125 46
– 0 125 46
as 0 125 46
a 0 125 46
“contrite” 0 125 46
papal 0 125 46
apology. 0 125 46

This 0 125 47
also 0 125 47
followed 0 125 47
an 0 125 47
astonishing 0 125 47
public 0 125 47
rebuke 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
the 0 125 47
pope 0 125 47
by 0 125 47
Sean 0 125 47

the 0 125 47
pope’s 0 125 47
sex 0 125 47
abuse 0 125 47
commission 0 125 47
– 0 125 47
who 0 125 47
said, 0 125 47
“It 0 125 47
is 0 125 47
understandable 0 125 47
that 0 125 47
Pope 0 125 47
Francis’ 0 125 47
statements 0 125 47
yesterday 0 125 47
in 0 125 47
Santiago, 0 125 47
Chile 0 125 47
were 0 125 47
a 0 125 47
source 0 125 47
of 0 125 47
great 0 125 47
pain 0 125 47
for 0 125 47

any 0 125 47

perpetrator.” 0 125 47

“Pope 0 125 48
Francis 0 125 48
fully 0 125 48
recognizes 0 125 48
the 1 125 48
egregious 1 125 48
failures 1 125 48
of 0 125 48
the 0 125 48
Church 0 125 48
and 0 125 48
its 0 125 48
clergy 0 125 48
who 0 125 48
abused 0 125 48
children 0 125 48
and 0 125 48
the 0 125 48
devastating 1 125 48
impact 1 125 48
those 0 125 48
crimes 0 125 48
have 0 125 48
had 0 125 48
on 0 125 48

their 0 125 48
loved 0 125 48

O’Malley 0 125 48
said. 0 125 48

Of 0 125 49
course, 0 125 49
Francis 0 125 49
being 0 125 49
Francis 0 125 49
the 0 125 49
apology 0 125 49
was 0 125 49
banked 0 125 49
around 0 125 49
with 0 125 49
assertions 0 125 49
of 0 125 49
how 0 125 49
right 0 125 49
he 0 125 49
was. 0 125 49

“I 0 125 50
have 0 125 50
to 0 125 50
ask 0 125 50
forgiveness 0 125 50
because 0 125 50
the 0 125 50
word 0 125 50
‘proof’ 0 125 50
wounded,” 0 125 50
he 0 125 50
said. 0 125 50

“It 0 125 51
wounded 0 125 51
many 0 125 51
people 0 125 51
who 0 125 51
were 0 125 51
abused…I 0 125 51
ask 0 125 51
them 0 125 51
for 0 125 51
forgiveness 0 125 51
because 0 125 51
I 0 125 51
wounded 0 125 51
them 0 125 51
without 0 125 51
realizing 0 125 51
it, 0 125 51
but 0 125 51
it 0 125 51
was 0 125 51
an 0 125 51
unintended 0 125 51
wound. 0 125 51

And 0 125 52
this 1 125 52
horrified 1 125 52
me 1 125 52
a 1 125 52
lot, 1 125 52
because 0 125 52
I 0 125 52
had 0 125 52
received 0 125 52
them.” 0 125 52

“And 0 125 53
I 0 125 53
know 0 125 53
how 0 125 53
much 0 125 53
they 0 125 53
suffer, 0 125 53
to 0 125 53
feel 0 125 53
that 0 125 53
the 0 125 53
Pope 0 125 53

a 0 125 53
proof.’ 0 125 53
It’s 0 125 53
a 0 125 53
slap. 0 125 53

And 0 125 54
I 0 125 54
agree 0 125 54
that 0 125 54
my 0 125 54
expression 0 125 54
was 0 125 54
not 0 125 54
apt, 0 125 54
because 0 125 54
I 0 125 54
didn’t 0 125 54
think.” 0 125 54

He 0 125 55
doubled 0 125 55
down, 0 125 55
saying, 0 125 55
“I 0 125 55
have 0 125 55
not 0 125 55
heard 0 125 55
any 0 125 55
victim 0 125 55
of 0 125 55
Barros. 0 125 55

They 0 125 56
did 0 125 56
not 0 125 56
come, 0 125 56
they 0 125 56
did 0 125 56
not 0 125 56
show 0 125 56
themselves, 0 125 56
they 0 125 56
did 0 125 56
not 0 125 56
give 0 125 56
evidence 0 125 56
in 0 125 56
court. 0 125 56

It’s 1 125 57
all 1 125 57
in 1 125 57
the 1 125 57
air. 1 125 57

It 0 125 58
is 0 125 58
true 0 125 58
that 0 125 58
Barros 0 125 58
was 0 125 58
in 0 125 58
Karadima’s 0 125 58
group 0 125 58
of 0 125 58
young 0 125 58
people. 0 125 58

But 0 125 59
let 0 125 59
us 0 125 59
be 0 125 59
clear: 0 125 59
if 0 125 59
you 0 125 59
accuse 0 125 59
someone 0 125 59
without 0 125 59
evidence 0 125 59
with 0 125 59
pertinacity, 0 125 59
that 0 125 59
is 0 125 59
calumny.” 0 125 59

“This 0 125 60
is 0 125 60
what 0 125 60
I 0 125 60
can 0 125 60
say 0 125 60
with 0 125 60
sincerity. 0 125 60

Barros 0 125 61
will 0 125 61
remain 0 125 61
there 0 125 61
if 0 125 61
I 0 125 61
don’t 0 125 61
find 0 125 61
a 0 125 61
way 0 125 61
to 0 125 61
condemn 0 125 61

I 0 125 62
cannot 0 125 62

him 0 125 62

there 0 125 63
are 0 125 63
many 0 125 63
ways 0 125 63
to 0 125 63
get 0 125 63
evidence. 0 125 63

Is 0 125 64
that 0 125 64
clear?” 0 125 64

This 0 125 65
“contrite” 0 125 65
papal 0 125 65
apology 0 125 65

on 0 125 66
the 0 125 66

described 0 125 66
it 0 125 66
as 0 125 66
“an 0 125 66
extremely 0 125 66
rare 0 125 66
act 0 125 66
of 0 125 66
self-criticism,” 0 125 66
for 0 125 66
the 0 125 66
“unusually 1 125 66
contrite” 1 125 66
Bergoglio, 0 125 66
and 0 125 66
noted 0 125 66
that, 0 125 66
“While 0 125 66
the 0 125 66

for 0 125 66

abuse, 0 125 66
his 0 125 66
efforts 0 125 66

sputtered.” 0 125 66

Indeed, 0 125 67

that 0 125 67
he 0 125 67
met 0 125 67

the 0 125 67
“pain” 0 125 67
of 0 125 67
the 0 125 67

the 0 125 69
pope’s 0 125 69

were 0 125 69
told 0 125 69

that 0 125 69
his 0 125 69

already 0 125 69
final, 0 125 69
some 0 125 69
six 0 125 69
months 0 125 69
before 0 125 69
the 0 125 69
trip.” 0 125 69

Who 0 125 70
is 0 125 70
Barros? 0 125 70

Some 0 125 71
may 0 125 71
remember 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
video 0 125 71
that 0 125 71
made 0 125 71
the 0 125 71
internet 0 125 71
rounds 0 125 71
of 0 125 71
an 0 125 71
uproar 0 125 71
in 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
Chilean 0 125 71
cathedral 0 125 71
at 0 125 71
the 0 125 71
installation 0 125 71
ceremony 0 125 71
of 0 125 71
a 0 125 71
bishop. 0 125 71

At 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
time 0 125 72
it 0 125 72
didn’t 0 125 72
draw 0 125 72
much 0 125 72
attention 0 125 72
from 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
English 0 125 72
language 0 125 72
press 0 125 72
– 0 125 72
mostly 0 125 72
at 0 125 72
that 0 125 72
time 0 125 72
distracted 0 125 72
by 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
ongoing 0 125 72
battle 0 125 72
of 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
notorious 0 125 72

Proposal 0 125 72
and 0 125 72
the 0 125 72
oncoming 0 125 72
Synods. 0 125 72

But 0 125 73
despite 0 125 73
the 0 125 73
pope’s 0 125 73
claim, 0 125 73
the 0 125 73
charges 0 125 73
against 0 125 73
Barros 0 125 73
are 0 125 73
serious 0 125 73
and 0 125 73
have 0 125 73
been 0 125 73
deemed 0 125 73
credible 0 125 73
by 0 125 73
a 0 125 73
judge. 0 125 73

He 0 125 74
is 0 125 74
accused 0 125 74
of 0 125 74
having 0 125 74
covered 0 125 74
up 0 125 74
sexual 0 125 74
abuse, 0 125 74
including 0 125 74
destroying 0 125 74
evidence, 0 125 74
committed 0 125 74
by 0 125 74
Karadima 0 125 74
in 0 125 74
the 0 125 74
‘80s 0 125 74
and 0 125 74
‘90s. 0 125 74

In 0 125 75
fact 0 125 75
– 0 125 75
and 0 125 75
this 0 125 75
point 0 125 75
has 0 125 75
tended 0 125 75
to 0 125 75
get 0 125 75
glossed 0 125 75
over 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
press 0 125 75
– 0 125 75
Barros 0 125 75
is 0 125 75
accused 0 125 75
by 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
victims 0 125 75
of 0 125 75
having 0 125 75
been 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
room, 0 125 75
watching 0 125 75
at 0 125 75
the 0 125 75
time, 0 125 75
and 0 125 75
of 0 125 75
engaging 0 125 75
in 0 125 75
sexual 0 125 75
activity 0 125 75
with 0 125 75
Karadima. 0 125 75

This 0 125 76
is 0 125 76
not, 0 125 76
therefore, 0 125 76
merely 0 125 76
a 0 125 76
matter 0 125 76
of 0 125 76
a 0 125 76
bishop 0 125 76
or 0 125 76
colleague 0 125 76
discovering 0 125 76
the 0 125 76
abuse 0 125 76
after 0 125 76
the 0 125 76
fact, 0 125 76
but 0 125 76
of 0 125 76
being 0 125 76
a 1 125 76
voyeuristic 1 125 76
participant. 1 125 76

that 0 125 80

a 0 125 81

the 0 125 82

The 0 125 108

that 0 125 118

even 0 125 121

a 0 125 124
cloud 0 125 124

he 0 125 124

undeniably 0 125 125
that 0 125 125
Danneels 0 125 125
had 0 125 125
told 0 125 125

The 0 125 126
cardinal 0 125 126
even 0 125 126
went 0 125 126
so 0 125 126
far 0 125 126
as 0 125 126
to 0 125 126
suggest 0 125 126
that 0 125 126

In 0 125 128
the 0 125 128
book, 0 125 128
Colonna 0 125 128
asks 0 125 128
the 0 125 128

Buendia, 0 125 132
confirmed 0 125 132
this, 0 125 132
saying, 0 125 132
“This 0 125 132
Pope 0 125 132
has 0 125 132
removed 0 125 132
two 0 125 132

three 0 125 132
bishops 0 125 132

month 0 125 132
throughout 0 125 132
the 0 125 132
world... 0 125 132

There 0 125 133
have 0 125 133
been 0 125 133
two 0 125 133
or 0 125 133
three 0 125 133
instances 0 125 133
in 0 125 133
which 0 125 133
they 0 125 133
said 0 125 133
no, 0 125 133
and 0 125 133
so 0 125 133
the 0 125 133
Pope 0 125 133
simply 0 125 133
removed 0 125 133
them.” 0 125 133

These 0 125 134
reforms 0 125 134
– 0 125 134
and 0 125 134

ceased 0 125 134
entirely 0 125 134
under 0 125 134
Francis. 0 125 134

Despite 0 125 135
his 0 125 135
claims 0 125 135
that 0 125 135
he 0 125 135
punishes 0 125 135
the 0 125 135
guilty, 0 125 135
it 0 125 135
was 0 125 135
in 0 125 135
fact 0 125 135
Francis 0 125 135
who 0 125 135

Mario 0 125 135
Inzoli 0 125 135
at 0 125 135
the 0 125 135
request 0 125 135
of 0 125 135
the 0 125 135
now-equally 0 125 135
notorious 0 125 135
Cardinal 0 125 135
Coccopalmerio. 0 125 135

Inzoli 0 125 136
was 0 125 136
found 0 125 136
guilty 0 125 136
in 0 125 136
2012 0 125 136
by 0 125 136
an 0 125 136
ecclesiastical 0 125 136
court 0 125 136
of 0 125 136
abusing 0 125 136
boys 0 125 136
as 0 125 136
young 0 125 136
as 0 125 136
twelve 0 125 136
and 0 125 136
suspended. 0 125 136

Inzoli 0 125 137
had 0 125 137
even 0 125 137
abused 0 125 137
boys 0 125 137
in 0 125 137
the 0 125 137
confessional, 0 125 137
convincing 0 125 137
them 0 125 137
that 0 125 137
the 1 125 137
abuse 1 125 137
was 1 125 137
approved 1 125 137
by 1 125 137
God. 1 125 137

Following 0 125 138
an 0 125 138
appeal 0 125 138
by 0 125 138
Coccopalmerio, 0 125 138
Francis 0 125 138
reduced 0 125 138
the 0 125 138
priest’s 0 125 138
penalty 0 125 138
to 0 125 138
a 0 125 138
“lifetime 0 125 138
of 0 125 138
prayer,” 0 125 138
with 0 125 138
permission 0 125 138
to 0 125 138
say 0 125 138
Mass 0 125 138
privately, 0 125 138

stay 0 125 138
away 0 125 138
from 0 125 138
children. 0 125 138

The 0 125 139
uproar 0 125 139
over 0 125 139
this 0 125 139
caused 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
Italian 0 125 139
prosecutors 0 125 139
to 0 125 139
reopen 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
case 0 125 139
against 0 125 139
the 0 125 139
priest, 0 125 139
and 0 125 139
eventually 0 125 139
Inzoli 0 125 139
went 0 125 139
to 0 125 139
prison 0 125 139
and 0 125 139
was 0 125 139
laicized. 0 125 139

As 0 125 140
for 0 125 140
Ratzinger/Benedict’s 0 125 140
procedural 0 125 140
reforms, 0 125 140
rumours 0 125 140
continue 0 125 140
to 0 125 140
circulate 0 125 140
that 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
pope 0 125 140
intends 0 125 140
to 0 125 140
reverse 0 125 140
them 0 125 140
as 0 125 140
well, 0 125 140
placing 0 125 140
competence 0 125 140
back 0 125 140
into 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
hands 0 125 140
of 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
same 0 125 140
dicastery 0 125 140
that 0 125 140
held 0 125 140
it 0 125 140
when 0 125 140
the 0 125 140
scandals 0 125 140
broke 0 125 140
in 0 125 140
2001. 0 125 140

This 0 125 141
has 0 125 141
been 0 125 141
denied 0 125 141
by 0 125 141
Greg 0 125 141
Burke, 0 125 141
but 0 125 141
given 1 125 141
Francis’s 1 125 141
usual 1 125 141
methods, 1 125 141
it’s 1 125 141
anyone’s 1 125 141
guess 1 125 141
who 1 125 141
in 1 125 141
reality 1 125 141
is 1 125 141
actually 1 125 141
dealing 1 125 141
with 1 125 141
these 1 125 141

A 0 125 142

commission, 0 125 142
was 0 125 142
ignored 0 125 142
and 0 125 142
then 0 125 142
Francis 0 125 142
summarily 0 125 142
removed 0 125 142
two 0 125 142
of 0 125 142

handling 0 125 142
such 0 125 142
cases, 0 125 142
