President 0 242 38
Johnson 0 242 38
should 0 242 38
have 0 242 38
resigned? 0 242 38

Someone 0 242 39
should 0 242 39
ask 0 242 39
you 0 242 39
these 0 242 39
questions 0 242 39
because 0 242 39
of 0 242 39
the 0 242 39
way 0 242 39
you 0 242 39
formulate 0 242 39
the 0 242 39
questions,' 0 242 39
he 0 242 39
jabbed. 0 242 39

'I 0 242 40
dealt 0 242 40
with 0 242 40
it 0 242 40
20 0 242 40
years 0 242 40
ago, 0 242 40
plus.' 0 242 40

Suddenly 0 242 41
philosophical 0 242 41
and 0 242 41
seeming 0 242 41
to 0 242 41
take 0 242 41

history, 0 242 41
Clinton 0 242 41
said: 0 242 41
'I 0 242 41
have 0 242 41
tried 0 242 41
to 0 242 41
do 0 242 41
a 0 242 41
good 0 242 41
job 0 242 41

my 0 242 41
life 0 242 41
and 0 242 41
with 0 242 41
my 0 242 41
work. 0 242 41

That's 0 242 41

all 0 242 41

I 0 242 41
