For 0

two 0
millennia, 0
Jews 0
have 0
suffered 0
persecution 0
after 0
persecution 0
at 0
the 0
hands 0

those 0
who 0
used 0

making 1
the 1

have 1
experienced 1
such 1
abuse 1
because 1
they 1
have 1
somehow 1
been 1

who 0

of 0
two 0
anti-crime 0
groups, 0
Anderson’s 0

“makes 0

lot 0
of 0
sense.” 0
With 0
statements 0
like 0
this 0
from 0
Zakkout 0
and 0
worse, 0
why 0
would 0
groups 0
committed 0
to 0
fighting 0
crime 0
continue 0
to 0
compromise 0
themselves 0
and 0
sabotage 0
their 0
mission 0

posted 0
onto 0

Facebook 0

a 0
video 0
clip 0
of 0
a 0
speech 0
made 0
by 0
Steve 0
Anderson, 0
the 0
pastor 0
of 0
the 0
Faithful 0
Word 0
Baptist 0
Church 0
in 0
Tempe, 0
Arizona. 0

Anderson 0
is 0
notorious 0
for 0
calling 0
for 0
the 0
killing 0
of 0
gays 0
to 0
end 0
AIDS. 0

In 0
the 0
clip, 0
Anderson 0
states 0
the 0
following: 0
“And 0
the 0
Jews 0
were 0
scattered 0
into 0
all 0
nations 0
for 0
literally 0
2000 0
years, 0
right? 0

For 0
1800 0
sum 0
odd 0
years. 0

And 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
everywhere 0
they 0
were 0
scattered, 0
they 0
were 0
persecuted, 0
hated, 0
treated 0
badly. 0

Why? 0

‘Cause 0
God’s 0
blessing 0
them? 0

No. 0

‘Cause 1
they’re 1
under 1
the 1
curse 1
of 1
God 1
for 1
having 1
rejected 1
the 1
Lord 1
Jesus 1
Christ.” 1

Blaming 0
Jews 0
for 0
the 0
extreme 0
torment 0
they 0
endured 0
for 0
so 0
long, 0
which 0
includes 0
a 0
Nazi 0
Holocaust 0
that 0
took 0
the 0
lives 0
of 0
six 0
million 0
innocent 0
Jews 0
and 0
so 0
many 0
others, 0
is 0
incredibly 1
offensive. 1

Indeed, 0
statements 0
and 0
beliefs 0
such 0
as 0
Anderson’s 0
have 0
provoked 0
hatred 0
and 0
persecution 0
of 0
Jews. 0

Towards 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
the 0
clip, 0
which 0
is 0
less 0
than 0
four 0
minutes 0
in 0
length, 0
Anderson 0
throws 0
the 0
anti-Semitism 0
in 0
people’s 0
faces. 0

He 0
zealously 0
states, 0
while 0
drawing 0
laughter 0
from 0
his 0
small 0
audience, 0
“You 0
say, 0
‘Why 0
are 0
you 0
preaching 0
against 0
the 0
Jews?’ 0
Well, 0
don’t 0
come 0
back 0
next 0
Wednesday 0
night. 0

Because, 0
next 0
Wednesday 0
night, 0
God’s 0
wrath 0
is 0
on 0
the 0
Jews 0
even 0
more!” 0

About 0

clip, 0
on 0
Facebook, 0
Zakkout 0
wrote 0
above 0
it, 0
“Makes 0
a 0
lot 0
of 0
sense!” 0
Of 0
course, 0
this 0
is 0
coming 0
from 0
someone 0
[Zakkout] 0
who 0
regularly 0
refers 0
to 0
Jews 0
as 0
“monkeys 1
and 1
pigs,” 1
and 0
in 0
February 0

circulated 0
on 0
social 0
media 0
a 0
report 0
claiming 0
that 0
“the 0
Holocaust 0
was 0
faked.” 0
The 0
report 0
calls 0
the 0
Holocaust 0
“the 0
biggest 0
lie 0
ever 0
foisted 0
upon 0
humanity” 0
and 0
was 0
produced 0

“Satan.” 1
He 0
states, 0
“Really, 0
they’re 0
not 0
Jews. 0

No, 0
that’s 0
Satan. 1

You 0
should 0
learn 0
to 0

You’re 0

Deceiver, 0

Rally 0
goers 0
repeatedly 0

After 0

He 0
signed 0

“Br. 0

The 0

declared 0
in 0

"Hamas 0

All 0
of 0
the 0
above 0
testifies 0
to 0
hatred 0
and 0
intolerance, 0
but 0
it 0
is 0
even 0
more 0
disturbing 0
given 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Zakkout 0
sits 0
on 0
the 0

Serving 0
alongside 0
Zakkout 0
on 0
these 0
boards 0
are 0
local 0
politicians 0
and 0
law 0

One 0
would 0
think 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
find 0
Zakkout’s 0
actions 0
and 0
bigotry 0
unacceptable, 0
as 0
well, 0
yet 0
Zakkout 0
continues 0

If 1

then 1
they 1

The 0
time 0
is 0
long 0

that 0
these 0

remain 0
true 0
to 0

safeguarding 0
the 1
American 1
public. 1

Sofian 0
Zakkout’s 0
bigoted 0
and 0
radical 0
agenda 0
is 0
antithetical 0
to 0
this 0
and 0
is 0
a 0

threat 1

His 0
presence 0
on 0
the 0

of 0
both 0

constitutes 0
an 0
obscene 1
travesty. 1

Once 0
and 0
for 0
all, 0
these 0
groups 0
need 0
to 0
divorce 0
themselves 0
from 0
Zakkout 0

repudiate 0
what 0
