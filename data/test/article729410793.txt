– 0
Cardinal 0
Paul 0
Josef 0
Cordes 0
criticized 0
fellow 0
German 0
Cardinal 0
Reinhard 0
Marx’s 0
suggestion 0
that 0
Catholic 0
priests 0
should 0
consider 0
“blessing” 0
same-sex 0
relationships 0
liturgically. 0

Marx’s 1
idea 1
“truly 1
seems 1
sacrilegious” 1
and 1
“ignores 1
the 1
clear 1
Revelation 1
of 1
God,” 1
Cordes 0
wrote 0
in 0
a 0
response 0
on 0
kath.net. 0

Dr. 0
Maike 0
Hickson 0

“The 0
Church 0
is 0
in 0
its 0
pastoral 0
care 0
bound 0
to 0
Holy 0
Scripture 0
and 0
to 0
its 0
interpretation 0
through 0
the 0
Church’s 0
Magisterium,” 0
wrote 0
Cordes. 0

“Marx 0
does 0
not 0
even 0
mention 0
that 0
homosexuality 1
always 1
contradicts 1
the 1
Will 1
of 1
God,” 1
citing 1
church 1
teaching 1
through 1
the 1
centuries. 1

Rather 1
than 1
being 1
about 1
receiving 1
“God’s 1
assistance 1
for 1
themselves,” 1
those 1
engaging 1
in 1
sodomy 1
and 1
wishing 1
to 1
have 1
it 1
“blessed” 1
by 1
the 1
Church 1
“aim 1
with 1
their 1
request 1
at 1
the 1
recognition 1
and 1
acceptance 1
of 1
their 1
homosexual 1
way 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
its 1
ecclesial 1
valorization.” 1

The 1
Catechism 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
teaches 1
that 1
“under 1
no 1
circumstances” 1
can 1
homosexual 1
activity 1
“be 1
approved” 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
“intrinsically 1
disordered.” 1
Such 1
acts 1
are 1
“contrary 1
to 1
the 1
natural 1
law. 1

They 1
close 1
the 1
sexual 1
act 1
to 1
the 1
gift 1
of 1
life. 1

They 1
do 1
not 1
proceed 1
from 1
a 1
genuine 1
affective 1
and 1
sexual 1
complementarity” 1
(CCC 1
2357). 1

However, 0
Marx 0
said 0
on 0
February 0
3 0
that 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
need 0
“closer 0
pastoral 0
care” 0
and 0
“one 0
must 0
also 0
encourage 0
priests 0
and 0
pastoral 0
workers 0
to 0
give 0
people 0
in 0
concrete 0
situations 0
[of 0
homosexual 0
unions] 0
encouragement. 0

I 1
do 1
not 1
really 1
see 1
any 1
problems 1
there.” 1

Marx 0
is 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops’ 0
Conference. 0

As 0
LifeSiteNews 0
previously 0
reported, 0
Marx 0
also 0
said 0
“yes,” 0
he 0
could 0
imagine 0
the 0
creation 0
of 0
a 0
rite 0
for 0
homosexual 0
couples 0
to 0
be 0
blessed 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

This 0
“encouragement” 0
from 0
priests 0
which 0
he 0
called 0
for 0
might 0
include 0
some 0
sort 0
of 0
“liturgical” 0
recognition 0
of 0
their 0
union. 0

But 0
“how 0
this 0
would 0
be 0
done 0
publicly, 0
in 0
a 0
liturgical 0
form,” 0
is 0
“another 0
question...that 0
is 0
where 0
one 0
has 0
to 0
be 0
reticent 0
and 0
also 0
reflect 0
upon 0
that 0
in 0
a 0
good 0
way.” 0

After 0
Catholic 0
News 0
Agency’s 0
initial 0
report 0
on 0
Marx’s 0
comments, 0
his 0
office 0
contacted 0
the 0
outlet 0
and 0
said 0
they 0
had 0
mistranslated 0
part 0
of 0
what 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
cardinal’s 0
office 0
sent 0
CNA 0
“a 0
request 0
for 0
correction 0
of 0
[its] 0
translation 0
of 0
the 0
interview 0
in 0
question, 0
expressing 0
concern 0
that 0
CNA's 0
translation 0
constitutes 0
a 0
false 0
reference 0
and 0
does 0
not 0
properly 0
reflect 0
the 0
position 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Marx.” 0

The 0
cardinal’s 0
office 0
maintains 0
that 0
rather 0
than 0
saying 0
“yes,” 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
possibility 0
of 0
liturgical 0
“blessing” 0
of 0
gay 0
unions, 0
he 0
answered 0
the 0
question 0
in 0
a 0
more 0
subtle 0
way 0
without 0
giving 0
an 0
explicit 0
“yes.” 0
However, 0
the 0
German 0
Bishops’ 0
Conference 0
doesn’t 0
seem 0
to 0
deny 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
his 0
statements 0
on 0
how 0
“one 0
must 0
encourage 0
priests” 0
to 0
give 0
encouragement 0
to 0
homosexual 0
couples, 0
which 0
could 0
include 0
public 0
blessings 0
that 0
would 0
take 0
a 0
“liturgical” 0
form. 0

The 0
cardinal’s 0
staff 0
asked 0
that 0
CNA 0
change 0
his 0
answer 0
about 0
liturgically 0
“blessing” 0
gay 0
unions 0
to: 0
“There 0
are 0
no 0
general 0
solutions 0
and 0
I 0
think 0
that 0
would 0
not 0
be 0
right, 0
because 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
pastoral 0
care 0
for 0
individual 0
cases, 0
and 0
that 0
applies 0
to 0
other 0
areas 0
as 0
well, 0
which 0
we 0
cannot 0
regulate, 0
where 0
we 0
have 0
no 0
sets 0
of 0
rules.” 0

Philadelphia 0
Archbishop 0
Charles 0
Chaput 0
has 0
also 0
spoken 0
out 0
against 0
Marx’s 0
proposal. 0

“Any 1
such 1
‘blessing 1
rite’ 1
would 1
cooperate 1
in 1
a 1
morally 1
forbidden 1
act, 1
no 1
matter 1
how 1
sincere 1
the 1
persons 1
seeking 1
the 1
blessing,” 1
wrote 0
Chaput. 0

He 0
explained 0
such 1
a 1
“blessing” 1
would 1
encourage 1
people 1
to 1
continue 1
living 1
in 1
a 1
way 1
the 1
Church 1
considers 1
gravely 1
sinful 1
and 1
spiritually 1
damaging, 1
and 1
therefore 1
would 1
be 1
uncharitable. 1

“There 0
is 0
no 0
love 0
– 0
no 0
charity 0
– 0
without 0
truth, 0
just 0
as 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
real 0
mercy 0
separated 0
from 0
a 0
framework 0
of 0
justice 0
informed 0
and 0
guided 0
by 0
truth,” 0
he 0
wrote. 0

“Creating 0
confusion 0
around 0
important 0
truths 0
of 0
our 0
faith, 0
no 0
matter 0
how 0
positive 0
the 0
intention, 0
only 0
makes 0
a 0
difficult 0
task 0
more 0
difficult.” 0

“There 0
are 0
two 0
principles 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
remember,” 0
Chaput 0
wrote. 0

“First, 0
we 0
need 0
to 0
treat 0
all 0
people 0
with 0
the 0
respect 0
and 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
they 0
deserve 0
as 1
children 1
of 1
God 1
with 1
inherent 1
dignity. 1

This 0
emphatically 0
includes 0
persons 0
with 0
same-sex 0
attraction. 0

Second, 0
there 1
is 1
no 1
truth, 1
no 1
real 1
mercy, 1
and 1
no 1
authentic 1
compassion, 1
in 1
blessing 1
a 1
course 1
of 1
action 1
that 1
leads 1
persons 1
away 1
from 1
God.” 1

“This 0
in 0
no 0
way 0
is 0
a 0
rejection 0
of 0
the 0
persons 0
seeking 0
such 0
a 0
blessing, 0
but 0
rather 0
a 0
refusal 0
to 0
ignore 0
what 0
we 0
know 0
to 0
be 0
true 0
about 0
the 0
nature 0
of 0
marriage, 0
the 0
family, 0
and 0
the 0
dignity 0
of 0
human 0
sexuality,” 0
he 0
explained. 0

“Jesus 1
said 1
the 1
truth 1
will 1
make 1
us 1
free. 1

Nowhere 1
did 1
he 1
suggest 1
it 1
will 1
make 1
us 1
comfortable.” 1

Cordes 0
has 0
a 0
history 0
of 0
defending 0
the 0
Church’s 0
moral 0
teaching. 0

Marx, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
pope’s 0
nine 0
main 0
advisors, 0
said 0
in 0
2016 0
that 0
same-sex 0
relationships 0
have 0
“worth” 0
which 0
must 0
be 0
recognized 0
by 0
the 0
Church. 0
