the 0 117 1

you 0 117 3

the 0 117 3

On 0 117 6
Thursday 0 117 6
evening, 0 117 6
Representative 0 117 6
Scott 0 117 6
Perry 0 117 6
(R-PA) 0 117 6
appeared 0 117 6
on 0 117 6
Tucker 0 117 6
Carlson 0 117 6
tonight 0 117 6
and 0 117 6
said 0 117 6
that 0 117 6
he 0 117 6
has 0 117 6
evidence 0 117 6
that 0 117 6
the 0 117 6

may 0 117 6
be 0 117 6
telling 0 117 6

that 0 117 6
they 0 117 6

actually 0 117 6
have 0 117 6
been 0 117 6
involved 0 117 6
in 0 117 6
the 0 117 6
deadly 0 117 6
attack. 0 117 6

Perry 0 117 7
brought 0 117 7
up 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
fact 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
we 0 117 7
can't 0 117 7
seem 0 117 7
to 0 117 7
get 0 117 7
information 0 117 7
in 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
case 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
the 0 117 7
public 0 117 7
needs 0 117 7
to 0 117 7
be 0 117 7
made 0 117 7
aware 0 117 7
of, 0 117 7
something 0 117 7
that 0 117 7
was 0 117 7
brought 0 117 7
up 0 117 7
in 0 117 7
a 0 117 7
district 0 117 7
courtroom 0 117 7
earlier 0 117 7
this 0 117 7
week. 0 117 7

Additionally, 0 117 8
the 0 117 8
family 0 117 8
of 0 117 8
Stephen 0 117 8
Paddock 0 117 8
just 0 117 8
received 0 117 8
his 0 117 8
cremated 0 117 8
remains 0 117 8
on 0 117 8
Thursday 0 117 8
and 0 117 8
his 0 117 8
brother 0 117 8
said 0 117 8
that 0 117 8
the 0 117 8
family 0 117 8
has 0 117 8
yet 0 117 8
to 0 117 8
receive 0 117 8
an 0 117 8
autopsy 0 117 8
report. 0 117 8

Why 0 117 9
is 0 117 9
that? 0 117 9

Everyone 0 117 10
who 0 117 10
was 0 117 10
killed 0 117 10
that 0 117 10
night 0 117 10
had 0 117 10
autopsies 0 117 10
and 0 117 10
those 0 117 10
have 0 117 10
been 0 117 10
released. 0 117 10

We're 0 117 11
told 0 117 11
Paddock 0 117 11
shot 0 117 11
himself 0 117 11
in 0 117 11
the 0 117 11
head, 0 117 11
right? 0 117 11

Why 1 117 12
would 1 117 12
the 1 117 12
autopsy 1 117 12
report 1 117 12
be 1 117 12
something 1 117 12
that 1 117 12
needs 1 117 12
to 1 117 12
be 1 117 12
withheld 1 117 12
from 1 117 12
the 1 117 12
public 1 117 12
or 1 117 12
his 1 117 12
family? 1 117 12

"Recently 0 117 13
I’ve 0 117 13
been 0 117 13
made 0 117 13
aware 0 117 13
of 0 117 13
what 0 117 13
I 0 117 13
believe 0 117 13
to 0 117 13
be 0 117 13
credible 1 117 13
evidence 1 117 13
regarding 0 117 13
potential 0 117 13

infiltration 0 117 13
through 0 117 13
the 0 117 13

regarding 0 117 13
this 0 117 13
incident," 0 117 13
Perry 0 117 13
said. 0 117 13

"Twice 0 117 14
before 0 117 14
the 0 117 14

ISIS 0 117 14
warned 0 117 14
the 0 117 14
United 0 117 14
States 0 117 14
they 0 117 14
would 0 117 14
attack 0 117 14
Las 0 117 14

he 0 117 14
added. 0 117 14

"In 0 117 15
June 0 117 15
and 0 117 15
August." 0 117 15

"And 0 117 16
then 0 117 16
after 0 117 16
the 0 117 16
attack 0 117 16
claimed 0 117 16
responsibility 0 117 16
four 0 117 16
times," 0 117 16
Perry 0 117 16
continued. 0 117 16

"Something’s 1 117 17
not 1 117 17
adding 1 117 17
up." 1 117 17

"I’m 0 117 18
just 0 117 18
telling 0 117 18
you 0 117 18
I 0 117 18
have 0 117 18
received 0 117 18
what 0 117 18
I 0 117 18
feel 0 117 18
to 0 117 18

and 0 117 18
believe 0 117 18
to 0 117 18
be 0 117 18
credible 0 117 18
evidence 0 117 18
of 0 117 18
a 0 117 18
possible 0 117 18
terrorist 0 117 18
nexus," 0 117 18
Perry 0 117 18
said. 0 117 18

The 0 117 19
investigation 0 117 19
has 0 117 19
been 0 117 19
conducted 0 117 19
by 0 117 19
local 0 117 19
and 0 117 19
state 0 117 19
police, 0 117 19
not 0 117 19
the 0 117 19
feds, 0 117 19
and 0 117 19
yet, 0 117 19
they 0 117 19
continue 0 117 19
to 0 117 19
claim 0 117 19
there 0 117 19
is 0 117 19
not 0 117 19
Islamic 0 117 19
terrorist 0 117 19
involvement. 0 117 19

Yet, 0 117 20
though 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
claim 0 117 20
that 0 117 20
Paddock 0 117 20
was 0 117 20
a 0 117 20
lone 0 117 20
gunman, 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
continue 0 117 20
to 0 117 20
withhold 0 117 20
video 0 117 20
of 0 117 20
him 0 117 20
in 0 117 20
Mandalay 0 117 20
Bay 0 117 20
because 0 117 20
they 0 117 20
are 0 117 20
still 0 117 20
investigating 0 117 20
other 0 117 20
suspects 0 117 20
to 0 117 20
charge 0 117 20
in 0 117 20
the 0 117 20
shooting. 0 117 20

And 0 117 21
no 0 117 21
one 0 117 21
seems 0 117 21
to 0 117 21
know 0 117 21

either. 0 117 21

None 0 117 22
of 0 117 22
this 0 117 22
is 0 117 22
really 0 117 22
that 0 117 22
surprising. 0 117 22

If 0 117 23
you 0 117 23
recall, 0 117 23
we 0 117 23
reported 0 117 23
on 0 117 23
Islamic 0 117 23
terrorists 0 117 23
settling 0 117 23
into 0 117 23
Mexico 0 117 23
and 0 117 23
crossing 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
border 0 117 23
some 0 117 23
years 0 117 23
back 0 117 23
and 0 117 23
that 0 117 23
came 0 117 23
out 0 117 23
as 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
infamous 0 117 23
"Gang 0 117 23
of 0 117 23
Eight" 0 117 23

working 0 117 23
on 0 117 23
an 0 117 23

had 0 117 23
rejected 0 117 23

fencing 0 117 23
Congress 0 117 23
authorized 0 117 23
just 0 117 23
seven 0 117 23
years 0 117 23
ago, 0 117 23
with 0 117 23
a 0 117 23
majority 0 117 23
of 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
Senate 0 117 23
saying 0 117 23
they 0 117 23
didn't 0 117 23
want 0 117 23
to 0 117 23
delay 0 117 23
granting 0 117 23
illegal 0 117 23

legal 0 117 23
status 0 117 23
while 0 117 23
the 0 117 23
fence 0 117 23
was 0 117 23
being 0 117 23
built. 0 117 23

Three 0 117 24
years 0 117 24
prior 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
report, 0 117 24
there 0 117 24
was 0 117 24
a 0 117 24
video 0 117 24
report 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
seems 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
have 0 117 24
provided 0 117 24
a 0 117 24
bit 0 117 24
of 0 117 24
evidence 0 117 24
to 0 117 24
the 0 117 24
claim 0 117 24
that 0 117 24
Islamists 0 117 24
were 0 117 24
crossing 0 117 24
our 0 117 24
southern 0 117 24
border. 0 117 24

And 0 117 25
even 0 117 25
though 0 117 25
Islamic 0 117 25
jihadis 0 117 25
have 0 117 25
been 0 117 25
apprehended 0 117 25
on 0 117 25
our 0 117 25
border 0 117 25
in 0 117 25
2014, 0 117 25
the 0 117 25
Homeland 0 117 25
Security 0 117 25
waved 0 117 25
their 0 117 25
hand 0 117 25
and 0 117 25
said, 0 117 25
"There's 1 117 25
no 1 117 25
threat." 1 117 25

In 0 117 26
fact, 0 117 26
DHS 0 117 26
had 0 117 26
denied 0 117 26
Muslim 0 117 26
terrorists 0 117 26
were 0 117 26
crossing 0 117 26
the 0 117 26
border, 0 117 26
but 0 117 26
a 0 117 26
local 0 117 26
investigator 0 117 26
produced 0 117 26
evidence 0 117 26
to 0 117 26
the 0 117 26
contrary. 0 117 26

Reports 0 117 27
indicated 0 117 27
that 0 117 27
some 0 117 27
jihadis 0 117 27
were 0 117 27
paying 0 117 27
as 0 117 27
much 0 117 27
as 0 117 27
$50,000 0 117 27
to 0 117 27
get 0 117 27
across 0 117 27
the 0 117 27
border. 0 117 27

This 0 117 28
has 0 117 28
been 0 117 28
documented 0 117 28
for 0 117 28
several 0 117 28
years 0 117 28
now. 0 117 28

It's 0 117 29
not 0 117 29
surprising. 0 117 29

What 1 117 29

is 1 117 29

surprising 1 117 29

is 1 117 29

the 1 117 29

level 1 117 29

of 1 117 29

secrecy 1 117 29

surrounding 1 117 29

the 1 117 29

Las 1 117 29

the 1 117 29

containment 1 117 29

of 1 117 29

information 1 117 29

more 1 117 29

than 1 117 29

three 1 117 29

months 1 117 29

it 1 117 29

occurred. 1 117 29
