for 0
preventing 0
the 0

here 0

the 0

timeline, 0
as 0
outlined 0
by 0

The 0

investigators 0

with 0
new 0
questions, 0
two 0
of 0
which 0
are 0
extremely 0
important: 0

What 0
happened 0
during 0
the 0
6 0
minutes 0
between 0
Campos 0
being 0
shot 0
and 0
Paddock 0
opening 0
fire, 0
and 0
why 1
weren’t 1
the 1
police 1
rushing 1
to 1
the 1
scene 1
immediately? 1

Why 0
did 0
shooter 0
Stephen 0
Paddock 0
stop 0
shooting? 0

Paddock 0
had 0
already 0
shot 0
the 0
security 0
guard, 0
waited 0
six 0
minutes 0
before 0
opening 0
fire 0
on 0
the 0
concert 0
crowd, 0
and 0
then 0
shot 0
for 0
a 0
full 0
ten 0
minutes. 0

Police 0
didn’t 0
arrive 0
for 0
two 0
additional 0
minutes 0
after 0
the 0
shooting 0
stopped 0
– 0
which 0
is 0
a 0
full 0
18 0
minutes 0
from 0
the 0
moment 0
Campos 0
was 0
initially 0
hit. 0

Moreover, 0
did 0
he 0
stop 0
shooting 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
planning 0
his 0
escape 0
from 0
the 0
32nd 0
floor? 0

Or 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
that 0
Paddock 0
was 0
rushed 0
and 0
in 0
a 0
state 0
of 0
panic? 0
