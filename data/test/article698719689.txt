An 0 33 1
outbreak 0 33 1
of 0 33 1
the 0 33 1
plague 0 33 1
in 0 33 1
Madagascar 0 33 1
is 0 33 1
spreading 0 33 1
at 0 33 1
an 0 33 1
unprecedented 1 33 1
rate. 0 33 1

With 0 33 2
the 0 33 2
ease 0 33 2
of 0 33 2
spreading 0 33 2
the 0 33 2
plague, 0 33 2
the 1 33 2
likelihood 1 33 2
that 1 33 2
this 1 33 2
disease 1 33 2
will 1 33 2
move 1 33 2
to 1 33 2
other 1 33 2
more 1 33 2
densely 1 33 2
populated 1 33 2
regions 1 33 2
of 1 33 2
the 1 33 2
planet 1 33 2
has 1 33 2
become 1 33 2
a 1 33 2
huge 1 33 2
concern 1 33 2
for 1 33 2
many. 1 33 2

So 0 33 3
far, 0 33 3
the 0 33 3
plague 0 33 3
has 0 33 3
claimed 0 33 3
57 0 33 3
lives 0 33 3
and 0 33 3
infected 0 33 3
more 0 33 3
than 0 33 3
680 0 33 3
others. 0 33 3

These 0 33 4

are 0 33 4
from 0 33 4
October 0 33 4

however, 0 33 4
and 0 33 4
the 0 33 4
disease 0 33 4
is 0 33 4
spreading 0 33 4
rapidly. 0 33 4

An 0 33 5
estimated 0 33 5
329 0 33 5
of 0 33 5
these 0 33 5
cases 0 33 5
and 0 33 5
25 0 33 5
of 0 33 5
the 0 33 5

were 0 33 5

A 0 33 7

according 0 33 7
to 0 33 7
the 0 33 7
World 0 33 7
Health 0 33 7
Organization. 0 33 7

Of 0 33 8
Madagascar’s 0 33 8
114 0 33 8
districts, 0 33 8
35 0 33 8
have 0 33 8
reported 0 33 8
cases 0 33 8
of 0 33 8
plague, 0 33 8
including 0 33 8
at 0 33 8
least 0 33 8
10 0 33 8
cities. 0 33 8

Plague 0 33 9
is 0 33 9
caused 0 33 9
by 0 33 9
infection 0 33 9
with 0 33 9
the 0 33 9
bacterium 0 33 9
Yersinia 0 33 9
pestis 0 33 9
and 0 33 9
is 0 33 9
typically 0 33 9
spread 0 33 9
through 0 33 9
the 0 33 9
bite 0 33 9
of 0 33 9
infected 0 33 9
fleas, 0 33 9
frequently 0 33 9
carried 0 33 9
by 0 33 9
rats. 0 33 9

The 0 33 10
bacteria 0 33 10
will 0 33 10
eventually 0 33 10
end 0 33 10
up 0 33 10
causing 0 33 10
the 0 33 10
often 0 33 10
fatal 0 33 10
plague. 0 33 10

Symptoms 0 33 11
can 0 33 11
include 0 33 11
painful, 0 33 11
swollen 0 33 11
lymph 0 33 11
nodes, 0 33 11
called 0 33 11
buboes, 0 33 11
as 0 33 11
well 0 33 11
as 0 33 11
fever, 0 33 11
chills, 0 33 11
and 0 33 11
coughing. 0 33 11

Pneumonic 0 33 12
plague 0 33 12
is 0 33 12
more 0 33 12
virulent 0 33 12
or 0 33 12
damaging 0 33 12
and 0 33 12
is 0 33 12
an 0 33 12
advanced 0 33 12
form 0 33 12
of 0 33 12
the 0 33 12
disease 0 33 12
characterized 0 33 12
by 0 33 12
a 0 33 12
severe 0 33 12
lung 0 33 12
infection. 0 33 12

The 0 33 13
infection 0 33 13
can 0 33 13
be 0 33 13
transmitted 0 33 13
from 0 33 13
person 0 33 13
to 0 33 13
person 0 33 13
via 0 33 13
airborne 0 33 13
droplets 0 33 13
from 0 33 13
coughing 0 33 13
or 0 33 13
sneezing. 0 33 13

The 0 33 14
incubation 0 33 14
period 0 33 14
is 0 33 14
extremely 1 33 14
short 0 33 14
too, 0 33 14
and 0 33 14
an 0 33 14
infected 0 33 14
person 0 33 14
may 0 33 14
die 0 33 14
within 0 33 14
12 0 33 14
to 0 33 14
24 0 33 14
hours 0 33 14
of 0 33 14

According 0 33 15
to 0 33 15
CNN, 0 33 15
the 0 33 15
cases 0 33 15
were 0 33 15
reported 0 33 15
by 0 33 15

They 0 33 16
include 0 33 16
probable 0 33 16
and 0 33 16
suspected 0 33 16
cases 0 33 16
as 0 33 16
well 0 33 16
those 0 33 16
that 0 33 16
have 0 33 16
been 0 33 16
confirmed 0 33 16
by 0 33 16
laboratory 0 33 16
tests. 0 33 16

And 0 33 17
while 0 33 17
the 0 33 17
country 0 33 17
experiences 0 33 17
regular 0 33 17
outbreaks, 0 33 17
with 0 33 17
an 0 33 17
estimated 0 33 17
400 0 33 17
cases 0 33 17
of 0 33 17
plague 0 33 17
each 0 33 17
year, 0 33 17
this 0 33 17
time 0 33 17
things 0 33 17
are 0 33 17
very 0 33 17
different, 0 33 17
experts 0 33 17
warn. 0 33 17

This 0 33 18
year, 0 33 18
health 0 33 18
officials 0 33 18
report 0 33 18
the 0 33 18
infections 0 33 18
started 0 33 18
much 0 33 18
earlier 0 33 18
than 0 33 18
usual, 0 33 18
and 0 33 18
they’re 0 33 18
occurring 0 33 18
in 0 33 18
new 0 33 18
areas, 0 33 18
including 0 33 18
urban 0 33 18
settings. 0 33 18

They’ve 0 33 19
also 0 33 19
seen 0 33 19
an 0 33 19
unexpected 0 33 19
number 0 33 19
of 0 33 19
cases 0 33 19
of 0 33 19
pneumonic 0 33 19
plague, 0 33 19
which 0 33 19
transmits 0 33 19
more 0 33 19
easily 0 33 19
from 0 33 19
person 0 33 19
to 0 33 19
person. 0 33 19

Historically 0 33 20
dubbed 0 33 20
the 0 33 20
“black 1 33 20
death” 1 33 20
the 0 33 20
bubonic 0 33 20
plague 0 33 20
has 0 33 20
been 0 33 20
responsible 0 33 20
for 0 33 20
several 0 33 20
worldwide 0 33 20
pandemics 0 33 20
in 0 33 20
the 0 33 20
past. 0 33 20

Early 0 33 21
detection 0 33 21
of 0 33 21
the 0 33 21
plague 0 33 21
is 0 33 21
key 0 33 21
since 0 33 21
both 0 33 21
forms 0 33 21
of 0 33 21
it 0 33 21
can 0 33 21
be 0 33 21
cured 0 33 21
with 0 33 21
antibiotics. 0 33 21

But, 0 33 22
occasionally 0 33 22
there 0 33 22
can 0 33 22
be 0 33 22
cases 0 33 22
of 0 33 22
septicemic 0 33 22
plague, 0 33 22
where 0 33 22
the 0 33 22
infection 0 33 22
has 0 33 22
spread 0 33 22
to 0 33 22
a 0 33 22
person’s 0 33 22
bloodstream 0 33 22
and 0 33 22
can 0 33 22
cause 0 33 22
bleeding 0 33 22
and 0 33 22
necrosis 0 33 22
of 0 33 22
tissue, 0 33 22
turning 0 33 22
it 0 33 22
black. 0 33 22

Internationally, 0 33 23
this 0 33 23
outbreak 0 33 23
is 0 33 23
also 0 33 23
being 0 33 23
taken 0 33 23
seriously. 0 33 23

WHO 0 33 24
