The 0 286 1
media 0 286 1
very 1 286 1
deliberately 1 286 1
misreported 0 286 1
the 0 286 1
Bundy 0 286 1
standoff, 0 286 1
ridiculing 1 286 1
the 0 286 1
men 0 286 1
involved 0 286 1
and 0 286 1
shrugging 1 286 1
at 1 286 1
the 1 286 1
murder 1 286 1
of 0 286 1
LaVoy 0 286 1
Finicum. 0 286 1

When 0 286 2
the 0 286 2
court 0 286 2
case 0 286 2
completely 1 286 2
collapsed, 1 286 2
the 0 286 2
media 0 286 2
buried 0 286 2
the 0 286 2
story. 0 286 2

Just 0 286 3
as 0 286 3
it 0 286 3
failed 0 286 3
to 0 286 3
provide 0 286 3
any 0 286 3
meaningful 0 286 3
information 0 286 3
about 0 286 3
the 0 286 3
background 0 286 3
of 0 286 3
the 0 286 3
case. 0 286 3

That 0 286 4
was 0 286 4
in 0 286 4
part 0 286 4
because 1 286 4
it 1 286 4
would 1 286 4
have 1 286 4
been 1 286 4
damaging 1 286 4
to 1 286 4
Obama. 1 286 4

And 0 286 5
because 0 286 5
they 0 286 5
didn't 0 286 5
care. 0 286 5

But 0 286 6
President 0 286 6

listened 0 286 6
to 0 286 6
the 0 286 6

The 0 286 9
evidence 0 286 9
at 0 286 9
trial 0 286 9
regarding 0 286 9
the 0 286 9
Hammonds’ 0 286 9
responsibility 0 286 9
for 0 286 9
the 0 286 9
fire 0 286 9
was 0 286 9
conflicting, 0 286 9
and 0 286 9
the 0 286 9
jury 0 286 9
acquitted 0 286 9
them 0 286 9
on 0 286 9
most 0 286 9
of 0 286 9
the 0 286 9
charges. 0 286 9

At 0 286 10
the 0 286 10
Hammonds’ 0 286 10
original 0 286 10
sentencing, 0 286 10
the 0 286 10
judge 0 286 10
noted 0 286 10
that 0 286 10
they 0 286 10
are 0 286 10
respected 0 286 10
in 0 286 10
the 0 286 10
community 0 286 10
and 0 286 10
that 0 286 10
imposing 0 286 10
the 0 286 10
mandatory 0 286 10
minimum, 0 286 10
5-year 0 286 10
prison 0 286 10
sentence 0 286 10
would 0 286 10
“shock 1 286 10
the 1 286 10
conscience” 1 286 10
and 0 286 10
be 0 286 10
“grossly 1 286 10
disproportionate 1 286 10
to 1 286 10
the 1 286 10
severity” 1 286 10
of 0 286 10
their 0 286 10
conduct. 0 286 10

As 0 286 11
a 0 286 11
result, 0 286 11
the 0 286 11
judge 0 286 11
imposed 0 286 11
significantly 0 286 11
lesser 0 286 11
sentences. 0 286 11

The 0 286 12
previous 0 286 12
administration, 0 286 12
however, 0 286 12
filed 0 286 12
an 0 286 12
overzealous 1 286 12
appeal 0 286 12
that 0 286 12
resulted 0 286 12
in 0 286 12
the 0 286 12
Hammonds 0 286 12
being 0 286 12
sentenced 0 286 12
to 0 286 12
five 0 286 12
years 0 286 12
in 0 286 12

This 0 286 13
was 0 286 13
unjust. 1 286 13

their 0 286 18
prison 0 286 18
