The 1
Dictator 1
Pope: 1
A 0
Call 0
to 0
Hierarchical 0
Opposition 0

Of 0
that 0
book, 0
no 0
less 0
than 0
Robert 0
Royal—signaling 0
growing 0
alarm 0
over 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
Debacle 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
mainstream— 0
has 0
written 0
: 0
“About 0
90 0
percent 0
of 0
it 0
is 0
simply 0
incontrovertible, 0
and 0
cannot 0
help 0
but 0
clarify 0
who 0
Francis 0
is 0
and 0
what 0
he’s 0
about.” 0
And 0
the 0
picture 0
that 0
emerges 0
in 0
stark 0
relief 0
in 0
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope, 0
as 0
Life 0
Site 0
News 0
reports 0
, 0
is 0
that 0
of 0
“a 0
power-hungry, 1
manipulative 1
dictator, 1
[who] 1
celebrated 1
the 1
abdication 1
of 1
Benedict 1
XVI” 1
because 0
he 0
knew 0
what 0
it 0
meant: 0
that 0
the 0
plan 0
to 0
give 0
him 0
the 0
Keys 0
of 0
Peter 0
in 0
2005 0
would 0
finally 0
come 0
to 0
fruition 0
in 0
2013. 0

“We 1
elected 1
you 1
to 1
make 1
reforms, 1
not 1
to 1
smash 1
everything!” 1
Thus 0
is 0
Cardinal 0
Leonardi 0
Sandri, 0
a 0
fellow 0
Argentinian 0
and 0
a 0
supporter 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
at 0
the 0
conclave 0
of 0
2013, 0
reliably 0
reported 0
literally 0
to 0
have 0
screamed 0
at 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
behind 0
closed 0
doors 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican. 0

Sandri 0
would 0
be 0
one 0
of 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Bergoglian 0
partisans 0
at 0
the 0
conclave 0
who 0
are 0
now 0
said 0
to 0
be 0
experiencing 0
“buyer’s 0
remorse,” 0
as 0
documented 0
most 0
recently 0
in 1
the 1
explosive 1
best-seller 1
The 0
Dictator 0
Pope 0
. 0

"When 0
the 0
shepherd 0
becomes 0
a 0
wolf, 0
the 0
first 0
duty 0
of 0
the 0
flock 0
is 0
to 0
defend 0
itself. 0

The 0
true 0
children 0
of 0
Holy 0
Church, 0
at 0
such 0
times, 0
are 0
those 0
who 0
walk 0
by 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
their 0
Baptism, 0
not 0
the 0
cowardly 0
souls 0
who, 0
under 0
the 0
specious 0
pretext 0
of 0
submission 0
to 0
the 0
powers 0
that 0
be, 0
delay 0
their 0
opposition 0
to 0
the 0
enemy 0
in 0
the 0
hope 0
of 0
receiving 0
instructions 0
which 0
are 0
neither 0
necessary 0
nor 0
desirable." 0

Francis, 0
writes 0
Royal, 0
“has 0
little 0
use 0
for 0
established 0
procedures, 0
precedents, 0
even 0
legal 0
structures 0
within 0
the 0
Church…. 0

When 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
himself 0
does 0
not 0
much 0
feel 0
bound 0
by 0
the 0
tradition 0
or 0
impartial 0
laws 0
he 0
has 0
inherited, 0
what 0
then?” 0
What 0
then 0
indeed? 0

The 1
Dictator 1
Pope 1
even 0
feels 0
at 0
liberty 0
to 0
demand 0
that 0
the 0
Lord’s 0
Prayer 0
be 0
changed 0
to 0
reflect 0
his 0
dissatisfaction 0
with 0
God’s 0
words: 0
“And 0
lead 0
us 0
not 0
into 0
temptation 0
[et 0
ne 0
nos 0
inducas 0
in 0
tentationem],” 0
which 0
Francis 0
has 0
decided, 0
after 0
2,000 0
years, 0
is 0
a 0
“not 0
a 0
good 0
translation.” 0
Apparently 0
lost 0
on 0
Francis, 0
given 1
the 1
disordered 1
mélange 1
of 1
bits 1
and 1
pieces 1
of 1
things 1
he 1
has 1
read 1
that 1
constitutes 1
his 1
theology, 1
is 0
the 0
distinction 0
between 0
sin, 0
a 0
culpable 0
act, 0
and 0
temptation, 0
which 0
arises 0
from 0
concupiscence 0
or 0
what 0
Saint 0
Thomas 0
called 0
the 0
fomes, 0
or 0
the 0
fleshly 0
inclination 0
to 0
sin, 0
which 0
grace 0
enables 0
us 0
to 0
control 0
by 0
the 0
rule 0
of 0
reason 0
over 0
the 0
passions. 0

But 0
now 0
we 0
are 0
witness 0
to 0
the 0
single 1
worst 1
act 1
of 1
tyranny 1
in 0
the 0
entire 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
papacy. 0

The 0
Church 0
has 0
seen 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
Popes 0
who 0
have 0
abused 0
their 0
power, 0
Alexander 0
VI 0
being 0
the 0
most 0
popularly 0
known 0
example. 0

But 1
never, 1
before 1
Francis, 1
has 1
there 1
been 1
a 1
Pope 1
who 1
dared 1
to 1
tyrannize 1
the 1
Magisterium 1
itself 1
by 1
attempting 1
to 1
bend 1
it 1
to 1
his 1
errant 1
personal 1
opinions. 1

By 0
publication 0
in 0
the 0
Acta 0
Apostolicae 0
Sedis 0
(AAS), 0
Francis 0
has 0
officially 0
declared 0
that 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
includes 0
the 0
guidelines 0
of 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
for 0
the 0
implementation 0
of 0
Chapter 0
8 0
of 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
(AL), 0
which 0
he 0
expressly 0
approved 0
in 0
his 0
letter 0
to 0
them 0
as 0
the 0
only 0
correct 0
interpretation 0
of 0
his 0
will. 0

The 0
guidelines 0
have 0
been 0
published 0
in 0
the 0
AAS 0
along 0
with 0
Francis’s 0
private 0
missive, 0
which 0
is 0
suddenly 0
declared 0
to 0
be 0
“an 0
apostolic 0
letter.” 0

The 0
normalist 0
narrative 0
has 0
just 0
been 0
stripped 0
of 0
any 0
colorable 0
argument 0
that 0
nothing 0
is 0
too 0
terribly 0
amiss 0
with 0
this 0
pontificate. 0

We 0
are 0
now 0
expected 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium”—meaning 0
simply 0
and 0
only 0
AL—teaches 0
what 0
the 0
guidelines 0
preposterously 0
declare, 0
solely 0
in 0
reliance 0
on 0
AL: 0

When 0
the 0
concrete 0
circumstances 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
make 0
it 0
feasible, 0
especially 0
when 0
both 0
are 0
Christians 0
with 0
a 0
journey 0
of 0
faith, 0
one 0
may 0
propose 0
that 0
they 0
commit 0
to 0
living 0
in 0
continence…. 0

In 0

other 0
more 0
complex 0
circumstances, 0
and 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
possible 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
declaration 0
of 0
nullity, 0
the 0
aforementioned 0
option 0
may 0
not, 0
in 0
fact, 0
be 0
viable. 0

Nonetheless, 0
it 0
is 0
equally 0
possible 0
to 0
undertake 0
a 0
journey 0
of 0
discernment…. 0

[I]f 0
one 0
arrives 0
at 0
the 0
recognition 0
that, 0
in 0
a 0
concrete 0
case, 0
there 0
are 0
limitations 0
that 0
diminish 0
responsibility 0
and 0
culpability 0
(cf. 0

301-302), 0
particularly 0
when 0
a 0
person 0
judges 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
fall 0
into 0
a 0
subsequent 0
fault 0
by 0
damaging 0
the 0
children 0
of 0
the 0
new 0
union, 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia 0
opens 0
up 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
access 0
to 0
the 0
Sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist 0
(cf. 0

notes 0
336 0
and 0
351). 0

As 0
Francis 0
would 0
have 0
it, 0
then, 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
has 0
just 0
flatly 0
contradicted 0
itself 0
for 0
the 0
first 0
time 0
in 0
two 0
millennia: 0

The 0
admission 0
of 0
public 0
adulterers 0
in 0
“second 0
marriages” 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion, 0
which 0
John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
in 0
line 0
with 0
all 0
of 0
Tradition, 0
called 0
“ 0
intrinsically 0
impossible 0
” 0
given 0
their 0
objective 0
state 0
in 0
life, 0
is 0
now 0
deemed 0
possible 0
depending 0
on 0
circumstances—that 0
is, 0
situation 0
ethics 0
applied 0
to 0
violations 0
of 0
the 0
Sixth 0
Commandment. 0

The 0

requirement 0
that 0
people 0
embroiled 0
in 0
such 0
unions 0
commit 0
to 0
living 0
in 0
continence 0
before 0
they 0
can 0
be 0
absolved 0
and 0
partake 0
of 0
the 0
Blessed 0
Sacrament—a 0
moral 0
norm 0
binding 0
“ 0
without 0
exception 0
” 0
because 0
it 0
is 0
rooted 0
in 0
divine 0
law—is 0
suddenly 0
demoted 0
to 0
a 0
mere 0
“proposal” 0
that 0
may 0
not 0
be 0
“feasible” 0
or 0
“viable” 0
in 0
“the 0
concrete 0
circumstances 0
of 0
the 0
couple.” 0

A 0
valid 0
annulment 0
of 0
a 0
truly 0
invalid 0
marriage, 0
the 0
sine 0
qua 0
non 0
for 0
entering 0
into 0
marital 0
relations 0
with 0
another 0
purported 0
spouse, 0
is 0
now 0
dispensed 0
with 0
in 0
“more 0
complex 0
circumstances… 0
when 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
possible 0
to 0
obtain 0
a 0
declaration 0
of 0
nullity,” 0
the 0
way 0
thus 0
being 0
opened 0
to 0
de 0
facto 0
divorce 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

The 0
meaningless 0
slogan 0
“journey 0
of 0
discernment” 0
cloaks 0
a 0
naked 0
authorization 0
for 0
the 0
official 0
toleration 0
of 0
adulterous 0
sexual 0
relations 0
in 0
the 0
Church’s 0
sacramental 0
life. 0

No 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
lends 0
his 0
name 0
to 0
the 0
outrageous 0
claim 0
that 0
children 0
resulting 0
from 0
an 0
adulterous 0
relationship, 0
blithely 0
referred 0
to 0
as 0
a 0
“new 0
union,” 0
could 0
be 0
“damaged” 0
if 0
the 0
partners 0
in 0
adultery 0
were 0
required 0
to 0
cease 0
their 0
adultery 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
be 0
absolved 0
and 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion—evidently 0
because 0
the 0
“new 0
union” 0
would 0
dissolve 0
without 0
adulterous 0
sexual 0
relations 0
and 0
there 0
could 0
be 0
a 0
second 0
divorce! 0

As 0
recently 0
as 0
seventeen 0
years 0
ago, 0
during 0
the 0
reign 0
of 0
John 0
Paul 0
II, 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council 0
for 0
the 0
Interpretation 0
of 0
Legislative 0
texts 0
reaffirmed 0
the 0
immutable 0
truth 0
reflected 0
in 0
Canon 0
915, 0
which 0
prohibits 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
to 0
those 0
“who 0
obstinately 0
persist 0
in 0
manifest 0
grave 0
sin.” 0
That 0
prohibition, 0
declared 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Council, 0
applies 0
to 0
the 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
not 0
as 0
a 0
matter 0
of 0
mere 0
disciplinary 0
law 0
subject 0
to 0
revocation 0
or 0
modification, 0
but 0
rather 0
“is 1
derived 1
from 1
divine 1
law 1
and 1
transcends 1
the 1
domain 1
of 1
positive 1
ecclesiastical 1
laws; 1
[and] 0
the 0
latter 0
cannot 0
introduce 0
legislative 0
changes 0
which 0
would 0
oppose 0
the 0
doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Church.” 0

Francis, 0
however, 0
has 0
purported 0
to 0
do 0
nothing 0
less 0
invent 0
exceptions 0
to 0
divine 0
law 0
that 0
oppose 0
the 0
doctrine 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
attempt 0
is 0
void, 0
of 0
course, 0
and 0
the 0
appellation 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
is 0
fraudulent. 0

But 0
the 0
consequences 0
of 0
this 0
Pope’s 0
toying 1
with 1
the 1
teaching 1
office 1
of 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
advance 0
half-baked 1
theological 1
notions, 1
such 0
as 0
“discernment” 0
(a 0
term 0
he 0
borrows 0
from 0
St. 0
Ignatius 0
of 0
Loyola 0
but 0
strips 0
of 0
its 0
original 0
meaning) 0
are 0
catastrophic. 0

Over 0
the 0
past 0
year, 0
Cardinal 0
Burke 0
and 0
a 0
few 0
other 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
have 0
called 0
upon 0
Francis 0
to 0
“clarify” 0
his 0
intention 0
respecting 0
AL. 0

That 0
clarification 0
has 0
now 0
been 0
given: 0
Francis 0
intends, 0
if 0
it 0
were 0
possible, 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
unchangeable 0
teaching 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
regarding 0
an 0
irrevocable 0
moral 0
norm 0
rooted 0
in 0
divine 0
law. 0

Even 1
if 1
the 1
attempt 1
is 1
void 1
and 1
of 1
no 1
effect 1
before 1
man 1
and 1
God—an 1
immoral 1
law 1
is 1
no 1
law 1
at 1
all—Francis 0
clearly 0
means 0
to 0
impose 0
his 0
will 0
by 0
fiat, 0
daring 0
invoke 0
the 0
“authentic 0
Magisterium” 0
to 0
cloak 1
his 1
absurd 1
novelties. 1

No 1
Pope 1
before 1
him 1
has 1
ever 1
dared 1
to 1
do 1
such 1
a 1
thing. 1

So 0
now 0
it 0
must 0
be 0
asked: 0
Where 0
are 0
the 0
cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
bishops? 0

With 0
one 0
or 0
two 0
noble 0
(however 0
inconsistent) 0
exceptions, 0
their 0
response 0
to 0
the 0
Bergoglian 0
Debacle 0
thus 0
far 0
ranges 0
from 0
silence, 0
to 0
active 0
complicity, 0
to—at 0
best—hand-wringing 0
over 0
the 0
increasingly 0
chaotic 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
while 0
begging 0
the 0
Pope 0
to 0
“clarify” 0
his 0
already 0
perfectly 0
clear 0
intentions. 0

At 0
this 0
point, 0
continued 0
pleading 0
for 0
a 0
Bergoglian 0
“clarification” 0
can 0
only 0
give 0
rise 0
to 0
an 0
impression 0
of 0
disingenuousness, 0
whereas 0
continued 0
silence 0
about 0
the 0
papal 0
origin 0
of 0
this 0
ongoing 0
catastrophe 0
is 1
a 1
standing 1
rebuke 1
to 1
all 1
the 1
hierarchs 1
who 1
know 1
what 1
we 1
all 1
know: 1
that 1
at 1
the 1
epicenter 1
of 1
the 1
chaos 1
is 1
the 1
most 1
wayward 1
Pope 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
ever 1
had 1
to 1
endure. 1

Continued 1
inaction 1
while 1
the 1
laity 1
and 1
a 1
few 1
good 1
priests 1
are 1
left 1
to 1
themselves 1
to 1
defend, 1
as 1
best 1
they 1
can, 1
the 1
constant 1
teaching 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
against 1
the 1
abuses 1
of 1
a 1
tyrant 1
on 1
the 1
Chair 1
of 1
Peter 1
threatens 1
the 1
hierarchs 1
with 1
a 1
legacy 1
of 1
shame 1
and 1
a 1
terrible 1
accountability 1
before 1
the 1
Just 1
Judge. 1

Their 0
failure 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Faith 0
by 0
standing 0
up 0
to 0
the 0
one 0
they 0
know 0
full 0
well 0
is 0
attacking 0
it 0
almost 0
daily 0
lends 0
itself 0
ever 0
more 0
to 0
an 0
indictment 0
for 0
timidity 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
unprecedented 0
danger 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
cause 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel 0
of 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
divinely 0
charged 0
to 0
be 0
leaders. 0

The 1
time 1
for 1
“prudence” 1
is 1
long 1
past. 1

Prudence 0
now 0
gives 0
way 0
to 0
mere 0
pusillanimity. 0

The 0
time 0
for 0
hierarchical 0
action 0
is 0
now, 0
before 0
the 0
damage 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
becomes 0
irreparable. 0

The 0
members 0
of 0
a 0
hierarchy 0
seemingly 0
cowed 0
by 0
a 1
papal 1
tyranny 1
the 1
Church 1
has 1
never 1
before 1
seen 1
must 0
rise 0
immediately 0
and 0
give 0
a 0
courageous 0
answer 0
to 0
the 0
challenge 0
posed 0
long 0
ago 0
by 0
Monsignor 0
Klaus 0
Gamber, 0
when 0
an 0
already 0
monumental 0
ecclesial 0
crisis 0
was 0
still 0
in 0
what 0
can 0
now 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
as 0
merely 0
a 0
preliminary 0
stage: 0

Where 0
in 0
our 0
Church 0
are 0
the 0
leaders 0
who 0
can 0
show 0
us 0
the 0
right 0
path? 0

Where 0
are 0
the 0
bishops 0
courageous 0
enough 0
to 1
cut 1
out 1
the 1
cancerous 1
growth 1
of 1
modernist 1
theology 1
that 1
has 1
implanted 1
itself 1
and 1
is 1
festering 1
within 1
the 1
celebration 1
of 1
even 1
the 1
most 1
sacred 1
mysteries, 1
before 1
the 1
cancer 1
spreads 1
and 1
causes 1
even 1
greater 1
damage? 1

What 0
we 0
need 0
today 0
is 0
a 0
new 0
Athanasius, 0
a 0
new 0
Basil, 0
bishops 0
like 0
those 0
who 0
in 0
the 0
fourth 0
century 0
fought 0
courageously 0
against 0
Arianism 0
when 0
almost 0
the 0
whole 0
of 0
Christendom 0
had 0
succumbed 0
to 0
heresy. 0

Will 0
none 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchs 0
rise 0
to 0
defend 0
the 0
Church 0
as 0
“a 0
new 0
Athanasius, 0
a 0
new 0
Basil”? 0

Even 0
the 0
best 0
among 0
them 0
continue 0
to 0
limit 0
themselves 0
to 0
generalized 0
lamentations 0
at 0
conferences 0
or 0
in 0
interviews 0
about 0
the 0
parlous 0
state 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
or 0
at 0
most 0
the 0
“confusion” 0
Francis 0
has 0
caused 0
by 0
not 0
“clarifying” 0
precisely 0
what 0
he 0
has 0
just 0
clarified. 0

They 0
avoid 0
the 0
absolutely 0
necessary 0
direct 0
and 0
public 0
exposure 0
of 0
error 0
at 0
its 0
source. 0

That 1
error 1
threatens 1
to 1
overwhelm 1
the 1
Church 1
while 1
they 1
do 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
fret 1
about 1
a 1
situation 1
whose 1
self-evident 1
cause—a 1
reckless 1
Pope 1
in 1
love 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
ideas 1
and 1
filled 1
with 1
contempt 1
for 1
Tradition—they 1
seem 1
incapable 1
of 1
identifying. 1

Concerned 0
clergy 0
and 0
laity 0
throughout 0
the 0
Catholic 0
world 0
are 0
doing 0
what 0
they 0
can 0
according 0
to 0
their 0
stations. 0

But 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
that 0
“final 0
battle” 0
over 0
marriage 0
and 0
family 0
of 0
which 0
Sister 0
Lucia 0
warned 0
the 0
late 0
Cardinal 0
Caffarra 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
the 0
Third 0
Secret 0
of 0
Fatima, 0
within 0
the 0
human 0
element 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
only 0
the 0
cardinals 0
and 0
the 0
bishops 0
possess 0
the 1
divinely 1
bestowed 1
power 1
to 1
repel 1
an 1
assault 1
on 1
marriage, 1
family 1
and 1
the 1
very 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
Faith 1
that 1
is 1
now, 1
for 1
the 1
first 1
time 1
in 1
Church 1
history, 1
being 0
led 0
by 0
a 0
Roman 0
Pontiff. 0

This 0
undeniably 0
apocalyptic 0
development 0
imposes 0
upon 0
the 0
hierarchs—first 0
and 0
foremost 0
in 0
the 0
Church—the 0
duty 0
to 0
act. 0

True 1
love 1
for 1
the 1
Church, 1
indeed 1
true 1
charity 1
toward 1
Francis 1
himself, 1
requires 1
of 1
them 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
what 1
was 1
required 1
of 1
Saint 1
Paul 1
when 1
the 1
first 1
Pope 1
fell 1
into 1
error 1
that 1
jeopardized 1
the 1
very 1
mission 1
of 1
the 1
Church: 1
that 1
Peter 1
be 1
withstood 1
to 1
his 1
face 1
(Gal. 1

2:11). 1

Our 1
Lady 1
of 1
Fatima 1
intercede 1
to 1
obtain 1
for 1
them 1
the 1
grace 1
of 1
fortitude 1
to 1
do 1
what 1
must 1
be 1
done 1
and 1
what 1
only 1
they 1
can 1
do. 1

Our 1
hopes 1

prayers 1
are 1
with 1
them 1

the 1
foremost 1
instruments 1
of 1
divine 1
providence 1

the 1
ecclesia 1
Dei 1
adflicta. 1
