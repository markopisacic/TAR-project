Trump’s 0 308 22

argued 0 308 22
that 0 308 22
it’s 0 308 22
impossible 0 308 22
for 0 308 22
the 0 308 22
president 0 308 22
to 0 308 22
obstruct 0 308 22
justice 0 308 22
because 0 308 22
his 0 308 22
constitutional 0 308 22
authority 0 308 22
extends 0 308 22
over 0 308 22

them 0 308 23
when 0 308 23
he 0 308 23
chooses, 0 308 23

That 0 308 24
firing, 0 308 24

Two 1 308 28

who 1 308 30
frequently 1 308 30
defends 1 308 30
Trump 1 308 30
on 1 308 30
television. 1 308 30

In 1 308 31
an 1 308 31
interview 1 308 31
with 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
Los 1 308 31
Angeles 1 308 31
Times, 1 308 31
Dershowitz 1 308 31
said 1 308 31
he 1 308 31
does 1 308 31
not 1 308 31
believe 1 308 31
Sessions 1 308 31
has 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
authority 1 308 31
to 1 308 31
end 1 308 31
the 1 308 31
probe. 1 308 31

“You 1 308 32
can’t 1 308 32
be 1 308 32
both 1 308 32
recused 1 308 32
and 1 308 32
making 1 308 32
decisions 1 308 32
about 1 308 32
the 1 308 32
investigation,” 1 308 32
he 1 308 32
said. 1 308 32

But 0 308 33
Dershowitz 0 308 33
also 0 308 33
cast 0 308 33
doubt 0 308 33
on 0 308 33
whether 0 308 33
Trump’s 0 308 33
tweets 0 308 33
can 0 308 33
be 0 308 33
seen 0 308 33
as 0 308 33
an 0 308 33
act 0 308 33
of 0 308 33
obstruction. 0 308 33

“You 0 308 34
cannot 0 308 34
obstruct 0 308 34
justice 0 308 34
by 0 308 34
openly 0 308 34
exercising 0 308 34
your 0 308 34
First 0 308 34
Amendment 0 308 34
rights 0 308 34
and 0 308 34
openly 0 308 34
criticizing 0 308 34
a 0 308 34
prosecution, 0 308 34
whether 0 308 34
you’re 0 308 34
right 0 308 34
or 0 308 34
wrong,” 0 308 34
he 0 308 34
said. 0 308 34

“Obstruction 0 308 35
of 0 308 35
justice 0 308 35
is 0 308 35
generally 0 308 35
committed 0 308 35
behind 0 308 35
the 0 308 35
scenes, 0 308 35
so 0 308 35
I 0 308 35
think 0 308 35
both 0 308 35
sides 0 308 35
are 0 308 35
a 0 308 35
little 0 308 35
overwrought 0 308 35
here.” 0 308 35

Stephen 0 308 36
Vladeck, 0 308 36
a 0 308 36
University 0 308 36
of 0 308 36
Texas 0 308 36
law 0 308 36
professor, 0 308 36
agreed 0 308 36
that 0 308 36
Sessions 0 308 36
cannot 0 308 36
stop 0 308 36
the 0 308 36
Russia 0 308 36
investigation 0 308 36
given 0 308 36
that 0 308 36
he 0 308 36
recused 0 308 36
himself. 0 308 36

“The 0 308 37
president, 0 308 37
intentionally 0 308 37
or 0 308 37
not, 0 308 37
is 0 308 37
misdirecting 1 308 37
his 1 308 37
ire,” 1 308 37
Vladeck 0 308 37
said. 0 308 37

If 0 308 38
Trump 0 308 38
wanted 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
use 0 308 38
his 0 308 38
power 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
end 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
probe, 0 308 38
he 0 308 38
would 0 308 38
have 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
give 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
order 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
Rod 0 308 38
J. 0 308 38

supervising 0 308 38
the 0 308 38
Mueller 0 308 38

work, 0 308 38
and 0 308 38
fire 0 308 38
Rosenstein 0 308 38
if 0 308 38
he 0 308 38
does 0 308 38
not 0 308 38
comply, 0 308 38
according 0 308 38
to 0 308 38
Vladeck. 0 308 38

Trump 0 308 39
could 0 308 39
also 0 308 39
try 0 308 39
to 0 308 39
replace 0 308 39
Sessions 0 308 39
as 0 308 39
attorney 0 308 39
general 0 308 39
with 0 308 39
someone 0 308 39
who 0 308 39

have 0 308 39
a 0 308 39

of 0 308 39
