We 0 95 4
finally 0 95 4
have 0 95 4
the 0 95 4
official 0 95 4
numbers, 0 95 4
and 0 95 4
they 1 95 4
aren’t 1 95 4

Reid 0 95 5
Wilson, 0 95 5
a 0 95 5
correspondent 0 95 5
for 0 95 5
the 0 95 5
Hill, 0 95 5
has 0 95 5
posted 0 95 5
to 0 95 5
Twitter 0 95 5
a 0 95 5
year 0 95 5
by 0 95 5
year 0 95 5
breakdown 0 95 5
of 0 95 5
sexual 0 95 5
harassment 0 95 5
settlements 0 95 5
and 0 95 5
awards 0 95 5
that 0 95 5
he 0 95 5
received 0 95 5
from 0 95 5
the 0 95 5
Congressional 0 95 5
Office 0 95 5
of 0 95 5
Compliance. 0 95 5

I 0 95 6
went 0 95 6
ahead 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
added 0 95 6
up 0 95 6
each 0 95 6
column, 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
what 0 95 6
I 0 95 6
discovered 0 95 6
is 0 95 6
that 0 95 6
264 0 95 6
cases 0 95 6
of 0 95 6
sexual 0 95 6
harassment 0 95 6
in 0 95 6
Congress 0 95 6
have 0 95 6
been 0 95 6
settled 0 95 6
since 0 95 6
1997, 0 95 6
and 0 95 6
the 0 95 6
total 0 95 6
amount 0 95 6
awarded 0 95 6
in 0 95 6
those 0 95 6
settlements 0 95 6
comes 0 95 6
to 0 95 6
a 0 95 6
grand 0 95 6
total 0 95 6
of 0 95 6
$17,250,854. 0 95 6

So 0 95 7
where 0 95 7
has 0 95 7
the 0 95 7
$17,250,854 0 95 7
come 0 95 7
from 0 95 7
to 0 95 7
pay 0 95 7
those 0 95 7
settlements? 0 95 7

That 1 95 8
money 1 95 8
has 1 95 8
come 1 95 8
from 1 95 8
the 1 95 8
taxpayers 1 95 8
of 1 95 8
course. 1 95 8

That 0 95 9
means 0 95 9
that 0 95 9
you 0 95 9
and 0 95 9
I 0 95 9
have 0 95 9
been 0 95 9
paying 0 95 9
to 0 95 9
cover 0 95 9
up 0 95 9
the 1 95 9
epidemic 1 95 9
of 1 95 9
sexual 1 95 9
harassment 1 95 9
that 0 95 9
has 0 95 9
been 0 95 9
taking 0 95 9
place 0 95 9
on 0 95 9
Capitol 0 95 9
Hill. 0 95 9

When 0 95 10
U.S. 0 95 10
Representative 0 95 10
Jackie 0 95 10
Speier 0 95 10
originally 0 95 10
told 0 95 10
us 0 95 10
that 0 95 10
more 0 95 10
than 0 95 10
15 0 95 10
million 0 95 10
dollars 0 95 10
had 0 95 10
been 0 95 10
paid 0 95 10
out 0 95 10
to 0 95 10
victims 0 95 10
of 0 95 10
sexual 0 95 10
harassment 0 95 10
in 0 95 10
recent 0 95 10
years, 0 95 10
I 0 95 10
was 0 95 10
envisioning 0 95 10
a 0 95 10
few 0 95 10
dozen 0 95 10
cases 0 95 10
at 0 95 10
most. 0 95 10

I 0 95 11
had 0 95 11
no 0 95 11
idea 0 95 11
that 0 95 11
the 0 95 11
total 0 95 11
number 0 95 11
of 0 95 11
cases 0 95 11
would 0 95 11
actually 0 95 11
be 0 95 11
well 0 95 11
over 0 95 11
200. 0 95 11

If 0 95 12
our 0 95 12
leaders 0 95 12
were 0 95 12
serious 0 95 12
about 0 95 12
stopping 0 95 12
this 0 95 12
from 0 95 12
happening, 0 95 12
they 0 95 12
would 0 95 12
pass 0 95 12
a 0 95 12
law 0 95 12
making 0 95 12
it 0 95 12
mandatory 0 95 12
that 0 95 12
all 0 95 12
cases 0 95 12
of 0 95 12
sexual 0 95 12
harassment 0 95 12
in 0 95 12
Congress 0 95 12
be 0 95 12
made 0 95 12
public, 0 95 12
and 0 95 12
that 0 95 12
members 0 95 12
of 0 95 12
Congress 0 95 12
would 0 95 12
be 0 95 12
personally 0 95 12
responsible 0 95 12
for 0 95 12
paying 0 95 12
out 0 95 12
any 0 95 12
settlements. 0 95 12

If 1 95 13
such 1 95 13
a 1 95 13
law 1 95 13
was 1 95 13
instituted, 1 95 13
I 1 95 13
guarantee 1 95 13
you 1 95 13
that 1 95 13
sexual 1 95 13
harassment 1 95 13
on 1 95 13
Capitol 1 95 13
Hill 1 95 13
would 1 95 13
come 1 95 13
to 1 95 13
a 1 95 13
screeching 1 95 13
halt. 1 95 13

But 0 95 14
they 0 95 14
don’t 0 95 14
want 0 95 14
it 0 95 14
to 0 95 14
stop. 0 95 14

For 1 95 15
many 1 95 15
in 1 95 15
Congress, 1 95 15
having 1 95 15
so 1 95 15
many 1 95 15
attractive 1 95 15
young 1 95 15
women 1 95 15
around 1 95 15
is 1 95 15
one 1 95 15
of 1 95 15
the 1 95 15
key 1 95 15
benefits 1 95 15
of 1 95 15
the 1 95 15
job. 1 95 15

I 0 95 16
included 0 95 16
the 0 95 16
following 0 95 16
quote 0 95 16
from 0 95 16
CNN 0 95 16
in 0 95 16
an 0 95 16
article 0 95 16
the 0 95 16
other 0 95 16
day, 0 95 16
but 0 95 16
I 0 95 16
also 0 95 16
believe 0 95 16
that 0 95 16
it 0 95 16
fits 0 95 16
just 0 95 16
perfectly 0 95 16
here… 0 95 16

In 0 95 17
an 0 95 17
environment 0 95 17
with 0 95 17
“so 0 95 17
many 0 95 17
young 0 95 17
women,” 0 95 17
said 0 95 17
one 0 95 17
ex-House 0 95 17
aide, 0 95 17
the 1 95 17
men 1 95 17
“have 1 95 17
no 1 95 17
self-control.” 1 95 17
“Amongst 0 95 17
ourselves, 0 95 17
we 0 95 17
know,” 0 95 17
a 0 95 17
former 0 95 17
Senate 0 95 17
staffer 0 95 17
said 0 95 17
of 0 95 17
the 1 95 17
lawmakers 1 95 17
with 1 95 17
the 1 95 17
worst 1 95 17
reputations. 1 95 17

And 0 95 18
sometimes, 0 95 18
the 0 95 18
sexual 0 95 18
advances 0 95 18
from 0 95 18
members 0 95 18
of 0 95 18
Congress 0 95 18
or 0 95 18
senior 0 95 18
aides 0 95 18
are 0 95 18
reciprocated 0 95 18
in 0 95 18
the 0 95 18
hopes 0 95 18
of 0 95 18
advancing 0 95 18
one’s 0 95 18
career 0 95 18
— 0 95 18
what 0 95 18
one 0 95 18
political 0 95 18
veteran 0 95 18
bluntly 0 95 18
referred 0 95 18
to 0 95 18
as 0 95 18
a 0 95 18
“sex 1 95 18
trade 1 95 18
on 1 95 18
Capitol 1 95 18
Hill.” 1 95 18

Do 0 95 19
you 0 95 19
want 0 95 19
to 0 95 19
stop 0 95 19
this 0 95 19
from 0 95 19
happening? 0 95 19

It 1 95 20
isn’t 1 95 20
going 1 95 20
to 1 95 20
stop 1 95 20
until 1 95 20
we 1 95 20
boot 1 95 20
out 1 95 20
the 1 95 20
corrupt 1 95 20
career 1 95 20
politicians 1 95 20
that 1 95 20
are 1 95 20
engaging 1 95 20
in 1 95 20
this 1 95 20
type 1 95 20
of 1 95 20
behavior. 1 95 20

So 0 95 21
I 0 95 21
am 0 95 21
asking 0 95 21
you 0 95 21
to 0 95 21
support 0 95 21
my 0 95 21
campaign 0 95 21
and 0 95 21
other 0 95 21
“grassroots 1 95 21
deplorables” 1 95 21
that 0 95 21
are 0 95 21
running 0 95 21
for 0 95 21
office 0 95 21
all 0 95 21
over 0 95 21
the 0 95 21
nation. 0 95 21

Morality 0 95 22
really 0 95 22
matters 0 95 22
when 0 95 22
it 0 95 22
comes 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
serving 0 95 22
in 0 95 22
public 0 95 22
office, 0 95 22
and 0 95 22
we 0 95 22
are 0 95 22
not 0 95 22
going 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
send 0 95 22
people 0 95 22
that 0 95 22
engage 0 95 22
in 0 95 22
sexually 0 95 22
inappropriate 0 95 22
behavior 0 95 22
to 0 95 22
Washington 0 95 22
anymore. 0 95 22

And 0 95 23
I 0 95 23
am 0 95 23
calling 0 95 23
on 0 95 23
Congress 0 95 23
to 0 95 23
immediately 0 95 23
release 0 95 23
the 0 95 23
details 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
all 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
the 0 95 23
264 0 95 23
cases 0 95 23
of 0 95 23
sexual 0 95 23
harassment 0 95 23
that 0 95 23
have 0 95 23
been 0 95 23
settled 0 95 23
since 0 95 23
1997. 0 95 23

The 1 95 24
American 1 95 24
people 1 95 24
have 1 95 24
a 1 95 24
right 1 95 24
to 1 95 24
know, 1 95 24
and 0 95 24
those 0 95 24
that 0 95 24
engaged 0 95 24
in 0 95 24
this 0 95 24
type 0 95 24
of 0 95 24
behavior 0 95 24
do 0 95 24
not 0 95 24
have 0 95 24
a 0 95 24
right 0 95 24
to 0 95 24
hide. 0 95 24

It 0 95 25
is 0 95 25
time 0 95 25
to 0 95 25
drain 0 95 25
the 0 95 25
swamp, 0 95 25
and 0 95 25
this 0 95 25
would 0 95 25
be 0 95 25
a 0 95 25
really 0 95 25
good 0 95 25
place 0 95 25
to 0 95 25
start. 0 95 25
