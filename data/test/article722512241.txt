Ex-Muslim 0

to 0
Pope 0
Francis: 0
“Naiveté 1
in 1
the 1
face 1
of 1
Islam 1
is 1
suicidal 1
and 1
very 1
dangerous” 1

“Many 0

are 0
even 0

the 0

Yes, 0
and 0
not 0
just 0
ex-Muslims. 0

It 0
has 0
become 0
a 0
superdogma 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church: 0
if 1
you 1
don’t 1
believe 1
that 1
Islam 1
is 1
a 1
Religion 1
of 1
Peace, 1
you 1
will 1
be 1
ruthlessly 1
harassed 1
and 1
silenced 1
by 1
the 1
U.S. 1
Conference 1
of 1
Catholic 1
Bishops 1
and 1
the 1
hierarchy 1
elsewhere 1
as 1
well. 1

The 1
bishops 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
are 1
much 1
more 1
concerned 1
that 1
you 1
believe 1
that 1
Islam 1
is 1
a 1
religion 1
of 1
peace 1
than 1
that 1
you 1
believe 1
in, 1
say, 1
the 1
Nicene 1
Creed. 1

And 0
the 0
Pope 0
is 0
almost 0
certain 0
to 0
ignore 0
this 0
heartfelt 0
appeal, 0
as 0
he 0
has 0
ignored 0
others 0
who 0
have 0
respectfully 0
questioned 0
his 0
departures 0
from 0
Catholic 0
teaching. 0

I 0
have 0
yet 0
to 0
meet 0
a 0
Catholic 0
prelate 0
who 0
believes 0
that 0
the 0
requirement 0
to 0
treat 0
all 0
charitably 0
applies 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
hold 0
opinions 0
that 0
have 0
been 0
deemed 0
unacceptable. 0

“Leave 0
them; 0
they 0
are 0
blind 0
guides. 0

And 0
if 0
a 0
blind 0
man 0
leads 0
a 0

both 0
will 0

A 0
new, 0
open 0
letter 0
to 0
the 0
pope 0
is 0
making 0
the 0
rounds 0
on 0
the 0
Internet, 0
and 0
it 0
has 0
gathered 0
over 0
2,600 0
signatures 0
so 0
far. 0

“Most 0
Holy 0
Father,” 0
it 0
begins, 0
“‬Many 0
of 0
us 0
‬have 0
tried 0
to 0
contact 0
you, 0
‬on 0
many 0
occasions 0
‬and 0
for 0
several 0
years, 0
‬and 0
we 0
have 0
never 0
received 0
the 0
slightest 0
acknowledgement 0
of 0
our 0
letters 0
or 0
requests 0
for 0
meetings.” 0

The 0
letter 0
is 0
not 0
from 0
the 0
dubia 0
cardinals, 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
more 0
than 0
800,000 0
signers 0
of 0
the 0
2015 0
Filial 0
Appeal, 0
or 0
from 0
the 0
signatories 0
of 0
the 0
Filial 0
Correction, 0
but 0
from 0
a 0
group 0
of 0
Islamic 0
converts 0
to 0
Catholicism, 0
who 0
want 0
Francis 0
to 0
answer 0
a 0
simple 0
question: 0
why 0
did 0
they 0
literally 0
risk 0
their 0
lives 0
to 0
become 0
Catholic 0
if 0
Islam 0
is 0
“a 0
good 0
religion 0
in 0
itself” 0
as 0
the 0
pope 0
“seems 0
to 0
teach”? 0

It’s 0
a 0
question 0
he 0
refuses 0
to 0
answer, 0
despite 0
endless 0
platitudes 0
of 0
how 0
important 0
it 0
is 0
to 0
be 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
marginalized 0
and 0
to 0
accompany 0
those 0
on 0
the 0
peripheries 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

The 0
signers, 0
however, 0
are 0
not 0
dissuaded 0
in 0
their 0
pursuit 0
of 0
a 0
paternal 0
answer: 0

You 0
do 0
not 0
like 0
to 0
beat 0
around 0
the 0
bush, 0
and 0
neither 0
do 0
we, 0
so 0
allow 0
us 0
to 0
say 0
frankly 0
that 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
understand 0
your 0
teaching 0
about 0
Islam, 0
as 0
we 0
read 0
in 0
paragraphs 0
252 0
and 0
253 0
of 0
Evangelii 0
Gaudium, 0
because 0
it 1
does 1
not 1
account 1
for 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
Islam 1
came 1
AFTER 1
Christ, 1
and 1
so 1
is, 1
and 1
can 1
only 1
be, 1
an 1
Antichrist 1
(see 0
1 0
Jn 0
2.22), 0
and 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
dangerous 0
because 0
it 0
presents 0
itself 0
as 0
the 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
Revelation 0
(of 0
which 0
Jesus 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
only 0
a 0
prophet). 0

If 1
Islam 1
is 1
a 1
good 1
religion 1
in 1
itself, 1
as 1
you 1
seem 1
to 1
teach, 1
why 1
did 1
we 1
become 1
Catholic? 1

Do 0
not 0
your 0
words 0
question 0
the 0
soundness 0
of 0
the 0
choice 0
we 0
made 0
at 0
the 0
risk 0
of 0
our 0
lives? 0

Islam 0
prescribes 0
death 0
for 0
apostates 0
(Quran 0
4.89, 0
8.7-11), 0
do 0
you 0
know? 0

How 0
is 0
it 0
possible 0
to 0
compare 0
Islamic 0
violence 0
with 0
so-called 0
Christian 0
violence? 0

“What 0
is 0
the 0
relationship 0
between 0
Christ 0
and 0
Satan? 0

What 0
union 0
is 0
there 0
between 0
light 0
and 0
darkness? 0

What 0
association 0
between 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
the 0
unfaithful?” 0
(2 0
Cor 0
6: 0
14-17)In 0
accordance 0
with 0
His 0
teaching 0
(Lk 0
14:26), 0
we 0
preferred 0
Him, 0
the 0
Christ, 0
to 0
our 0
own 0
life. 0

Are 0
we 0
not 0
in 0
a 0
good 0
position 0
to 0
talk 0
to 0
you 0
about 0
Islam? 0

The 0
letter 0
makes 0
short 0
work 0
of 0
the 0
notion 0
that 0
Islam 0
and 0
Christianity 0
can 0
ever 0
be 0
compatible, 0
or 0
that 0
Islam 0
can 0
serve 0
as 0
a 0
path 0
to 0
salvation: 0

In 0
fact, 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
Islam 0
wants 0
us 0
to 0
be 0
its 0
enemy, 0
we 0
are, 0
and 0
all 0
our 0
protestations 0
of 0
friendship 0
cannot 0
change 0
anything. 0

As 1
a 1
proper 1
Antichrist, 1
Islam 1
exists 1
only 1
as 1
an 1
enemy 1
of 1
all: 1
“Between 0
us 0
and 0
you 0
there 0
is 0
enmity 0
and 0
hatred 0
forever, 0
until 0
you 0
believe 0
in 0
Allah 0
alone!” 0
(Qur’an 0
60.4) 0
For 1
the 1
Qur’an, 1
Christians 1
“are 1
only 1
impurity” 1
(Quran 0
9.28),” 0
“the 1
worst 1
of 1
Creation” 1
(Qur’an 0
98.6), 0
all 1
condemned 1
to 1
Hell 1
(Qur’an 0
4.48), 0
so 1
Allah 1
must 1
exterminate 1
them 1
(Quran 0
9.30). 0

We 0
must 0
not 0
be 0
deceived 0
by 0
the 0
Quranic 0
verses 0
deemed 0
tolerant, 0
because 0
they 0
have 0
all 0
been 0
repealed 0
by 0
the 0
verse 0
of 0
the 0
Sword 0
(Quran 0
9.5). 0

Where 0
the 0
Gospel 0
proclaims 0
the 0
good 0
news 0
of 0
Jesus’ 0
death 0
and 0
resurrection 0
for 0
the 0
salvation 0
of 0
all, 0
and 0
the 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
the 0
Covenant 0
initiated 0
with 0
the 0
Hebrews, 0
Allah 1
has 1
nothing 1
to 1
offer 1
but 1
war 1
and 1
murder 1
of 1
the 1
“infidels” 1
in 1
exchange 1
for 1
his 1
paradise: 1
“They 0
fight 0
on 0
the 0
way 0
of 0
Allah, 0
they 0
kill 0
and 0
are 0
killed.” 0
(Quran 0
9:11) 0
We 0
do 0
not 0
confuse 0
Islam 0
with 0
Muslims, 0
but 0
if 0
for 0
you 0
“dialogue” 0
means 0
the 0
voice 0
of 0
peace, 0
for 0
Islam 0
it’s 0
only 0
another 0
way 0
to 0
make 0
war. 0

Also, 0
as 0
it 0
was 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Nazism 0
and 0
communism, 0
naiveté 0
in 0
the 0
face 0
of 0
Islam 0
is 0
suicidal 0
and 0
very 0
dangerous. 0

How 0
can 0
you 0
speak 0
of 0
peace 0
and 0
endorse 0
Islam, 0
as 0
you 0
seem 0
to 0
do: 0
“To 0
wring 0
from 0
our 0
hearts 0
the 0
disease 0
that 0
plagues 0
our 0
lives 0
(…) 0
Let 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
Christians 0
do 0
it 0
with 0
the 0
Bible 0
and 0
those 0
who 0
are 0
Muslims 0
do 0
it 0
with 0
the 0
Quran. 0

“(Rome, 0
January 0
20, 0
2014)? 0

That 0
the 0
Pope 0
seems 0
to 0
propose 0
the 0
Quran 0
as 0
a 0
way 0
of 0
salvation, 0
is 0
that 0
not 0
cause 0
for 0
worry? 0

Should 0
we 0
return 0
to 0
Islam? 0

The 1
authors 1
say 1
that 1
Islam 1
can 1
be 1
no 1
ally 1
in 1
the 1
battle 1
“against 1
the 1
powers 1
that 1
want 1
to 1
dominate 1
and 1
enslave 1
the 1
world” 1
because 1
“they 1
share 1
the 1
same 1
totalitarian 1
logic 1
based 1
on 1
the 1
rejection 1
of 1
the 1
kingship 1
of 1
Christ 1
(Lk 0
4.7).” 0
They 0
contest 0
the 0
idea 0
that 0
speaking 0
in 0
an 0
“Islamophilic 0
tone” 0
will 0
help 0
those 0
Christians 0
who 0
are 0
suffering 0
persecution 0
in 0
Muslim 0
countries, 0
professing 0
that 0
“apart 0
from 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Jesus 1
has 1
never 1
indicated 1
any 1
other 1
way 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
Cross, 1
so 0
that 0
we 0
must 0
find 0
our 0
joy 0
therein 0
and 0
not 0
flee 0
with 0
all 0
the 0
damned, 0
we 0
do 0
not 0
doubt 0
that 0
only 0
the 0
proclamation 0
of 0
the 0
Truth 0
brings 0
with 0
it 0
not 0
only 0
salvation, 0
but 0
freedom 0
as 0
well 0
(John 0
8.32).” 0

The 1
letter 1
also 1
contrasts 1
the 1
stance 1
of 1
Islamic 1
countries 1
like 1
Turkey 1
and 1
Saudi 1
Arabia 1
who 1
“do 1
not 1
welcome 1
any 1
refugee” 1
while 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
preaches 1

the 0
welcoming 0
of 0
migrants 0
regardless 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
Muslims, 0
something 0
forbidden 0
by 0
Apostolic 0
command: 0
“If 0
anyone 0
comes 0
to 0
you 0
but 0
refuses 0
this 0
Gospel, 0
do 0
not 0
receive 0
him 0
among 0
you 0
nor 0
greet 0
him. 0

Whoever 0
greets 0
him 0
participates 0
in 0
his 0
evil 0
works.” 0
(2 0
John 0
1.10-11); 0
“If 0
anyone 0
preaches 0
to 0
you 0
a 0
different 0
Gospel, 0
let 0
him 0
be 0
accursed!” 0
(Galatians 0
1.8-9) 0

The 0
signatories 0
go 0
on 0
to 0
give 0
voice 0
to 0
the 1
utter 1
scandal 1
of 1
the 1
pope’s 1
failure 1
to 0
carry 0
out 0
his 0
evangelical 0
mission 0
as 0
the 0
Vicar 0
of 0
Christ 0
to 0
call 0
home 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
faith: 0

The 0
pro-Islam 0
speech 0
of 0
Your 0
Holiness 0
leads 0
us 0
to 0
deplore 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Muslims 0
are 0
not 0
invited 0
to 0
leave 0
Islam, 0
and 0
that 0
many 0
ex-Muslims, 0
such 0
as 0
Magdi 0
Allam, 0
are 0
even 0
leaving 0
the 0
Church, 0
disgusted 1
by 1
her 1
cowardice, 1
wounded 1
by 1
equivocal 1
gestures, 1
confused 1
by 1
the 1
lack 1
of 1
evangelization, 1
scandalized 1
by 1
the 1
praise 1
given 1
to 1
Islam 1
… 1
Thus 1
ignorant 1
souls 1
are 1
misled… 1

Taking 1
the 1
matter 1
further, 1
they 1
warn, 1
too, 1
of 1
the 1
physical 1
danger 1
the 1
pope’s 1
disposition 1
toward 1
Islam 1
invites, 1
saying 1
that 1
it 1
has 1
resulted 1
in 1
Christians 1

not 1
preparing 1
for 1
a 1
confrontation 1
with 1
Islam, 1
to 0
which 0
St. 0
John 0
Paul 0
II 0
has 0
called 0
them 0
(Ecclesia 0
in 0
Europa, 0
No. 0

57). 0

We 0
are 0
under 0
the 0
impression 0
that 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
take 0
your 0
brother 0
Bishop 0
Nona 0
Amel, 0
Chaldean-Catholic 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Mosul 0
in 0
exile, 0
seriously, 0
when 0
he 0
tells 0
us: 0
“Our 1
present 1
sufferings 1
are 1
the 1
prelude 1
to 1
those 1
that 1
you, 1
Europeans 1
and 1
Western 1
Christians, 1
will 1
suffer 1
in 1
the 1
near 1
future. 1

I 0
have 0
lost 0
my 0
diocese. 0

The 1
headquarters 1
of 1
my 1
archdiocese 1
and 1
my 1
apostolate 1
have 1
been 1
occupied 1
by 1
radical 1
Islamists 1
who 1
want 1
us 1
to 1
convert 1
or 1
die. 1

(…) 0
You 1
are 1
welcoming 1
into 1
your 1
country 1
an 1
ever 1
increasing 1
number 1
of 1
Muslims. 1

You 1
are 1
in 1
danger 1
as 1
well. 1

You 1
must 1
make 1
strong 1
and 1
courageous 1
decisions 1
(…). 0

You 0
think 0
that 0
all 0
men 0
are 0
equal, 0
but 0
Islam 0
does 0
not 0
say 0
that 0
all 0
men 0
are 0
equal. 0

(…) 0
If 0
you 0
do 0
not 0
understand 0
this 0
very 0
quickly, 0
you 0
will 0
become 0
the 0
victims 0
of 0
the 0
enemy 0
that 0
you 0
have 0
invited 0
into 0
your 0
home.” 0
(August 0
9, 0
2014) 0
“. 0

This 1
is 1
a 1
matter 1
of 1
life 1
and 1
death, 1
and 1
any 1
complacency 1
towards 1
Islam 1
is 1
treasonous. 1

We 1
do 1
not 1
wish 1
the 1
West 1
to 1
continue 1
with 1
Islamization, 1
nor 1
that 1
your 1
actions 1
contribute 1
to 1
it. 1

Where 0
then 0
would 0
we 0
go 0
to 0
seek 0
refuge? 0

The 0
signatories 0
plea 0
is 0
that 0
the 0

will 0
“quickly 0
convene 0
a 0
synod 0

dangers 0
of 0
