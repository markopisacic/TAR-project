no 0 130 1

India 0 130 2
wants 0 130 2
to 0 130 2
tackle 0 130 2
both 0 130 2
those 0 130 2

one 1 130 2

with 0 130 2
its 0 130 2
Chandrayaan-2 0 130 2
mission, 0 130 2
a 0 130 2

The 0 130 3
mission 0 130 3
is 0 130 3
scheduled 0 130 3
to 0 130 3
launch 0 130 3
sometime 0 130 3
in 0 130 3
the 0 130 3
first 0 130 3

no 0 130 3
earlier 0 130 3
than 0 130 3
March. 0 130 3

Its 0 130 4
target 0 130 4
is 0 130 4
a 0 130 4
patch 0 130 4
of 0 130 4
lunar 0 130 4
surface 0 130 4
about 0 130 4
370 0 130 4
miles 0 130 4
away 0 130 4
from 0 130 4
the 0 130 4
south 0 130 4
pole, 0 130 4
where 0 130 4
scientists 0 130 4
think 0 130 4
the 0 130 4
rock 0 130 4
may 0 130 4
be 0 130 4
4 0 130 4
billion 0 130 4
years 0 130 4
old, 0 130 4
formed 0 130 4
just 0 130 4
after 0 130 4
the 0 130 4
moon's 0 130 4
giant 0 130 4
ocean 0 130 4
of 0 130 4
liquid 0 130 4

to 0 130 4
solidify. 0 130 4

The 0 130 5
region 0 130 5
is 0 130 5
an 0 130 5
area 0 130 5
NASA 0 130 5
would 0 130 5
also 0 130 5
like 0 130 5
to 0 130 5
visit, 0 130 5
preferably 0 130 5
with 0 130 5
a 0 130 5
robot 0 130 5
that 0 130 5
would 0 130 5
bring 0 130 5
souvenir 0 130 5
rock 0 130 5
home 0 130 5
to 0 130 5
Earth 0 130 5
for 0 130 5
scientists 0 130 5
to 0 130 5
analyze 0 130 5
directly 0 130 5
in 0 130 5
the 0 130 5
laboratory. 0 130 5

But 0 130 6
despite 0 130 6
NASA's 0 130 6
renewed 0 130 6
focus 0 130 6
on 0 130 6
lunar 0 130 6
exploration, 0 130 6
as 0 130 6
dictated 0 130 6
in 0 130 6
December 0 130 6
by 0 130 6
an 0 130 6
order 0 130 6
from 0 130 6
President 0 130 6
Trump, 0 130 6
the 0 130 6
agency 0 130 6
won't 0 130 6
beat 0 130 6
India 0 130 6
back 0 130 6
to 0 130 6
the 0 130 6

That's 0 130 8
even 0 130 8
after 0 130 8
India's 0 130 8
Chandrayaan-2 0 130 8
mission 0 130 8
was 0 130 8
delayed 0 130 8
by 0 130 8
three 0 130 8
years 0 130 8
after 0 130 8
Russia 0 130 8
backed 0 130 8
out 0 130 8
of 0 130 8
designing 0 130 8

producing 0 130 8
the 0 130 8

Rather 0 130 9
than 0 130 9
lose 0 130 9
out 0 130 9
on 0 130 9
that 0 130 9
part 0 130 9
of 0 130 9
the 0 130 9

the 0 130 9
Indian 0 130 9
Space 0 130 9
Research 0 130 9
Organization 0 130 9
decided 0 130 9
to 0 130 9
just 0 130 9
do 0 130 9
it 0 130 9
themselves. 0 130 9

But 0 130 10
they 0 130 10
aren't 0 130 10
sure 0 130 10
how 0 130 10
long 0 130 10
they 0 130 10
can 0 130 10
expect 0 130 10
the 0 130 10

to 0 130 10
last 0 130 10
once 0 130 10
the 0 130 10
lander 0 130 10
and 0 130 10
rover 0 130 10
arriveâ€”it 0 130 10
could 0 130 10
be 0 130 10
over 0 130 10
in 0 130 10
as 0 130 10
little 0 130 10
as 0 130 10
two 0 130 10
weeks, 0 130 10
ending 0 130 10
as 0 130 10
soon 0 130 10
as 0 130 10
the 0 130 10
sun 0 130 10
sets, 0 130 10
since 0 130 10
the 0 130 10
mission 0 130 10
runs 0 130 10
on 0 130 10
solar 0 130 10

the 0 130 10

even 0 130 10
during 0 130 10
the 0 130 10

During 0 130 11

The 0 130 14
new 0 130 14
mission's 0 130 14
predecessor, 0 130 14
Chandrayaan-1, 0 130 14
was 0 130 14
an 0 130 14
orbiter 0 130 14
that 0 130 14
found 0 130 14
the 0 130 14
first 0 130 14
evidence 0 130 14
that 0 130 14
there 0 130 14
was 0 130 14
water 0 130 14
ice 0 130 14
on 0 130 14
the 0 130 14
moon. 0 130 14

Now, 0 130 15
scientists 0 130 15
know 0 130 15
that 0 130 15
ice 0 130 15
is 0 130 15
likely 0 130 15
concentrated 0 130 15
at 0 130 15
the 0 130 15
poles, 0 130 15
where 0 130 15
it 0 130 15
could 0 130 15
become 0 130 15
an 0 130 15
important 0 130 15
