During 0
the 0
last 0
5 0
years 0
of 0
this 0
papacy, 0
Francis 0
and 0
his 0
Synodal 1
Schemers 1
masterfully 1
manipulated, 1
rigged, 1
and 0
exploited 1
the 0
synodal 0
process. 0

The 0
backdoor 0
tactics 0
and 0
machinations 0
were 0
brilliantly 0
documented 0
by 0
Edward 0
Pentin 0
, 0
Henry 0
Sire, 0
George 0
Neumayr 0
and 0
an 0
array 0
of 0
investigative 0
journalists. 0

The 0
fool 0
doth 0
think 0
he 0
is 0
wise, 0
but 0
the 0
wise 0
man 0
knows 0
himself 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
fool. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
Cardinal 0
Farrell 0
sit 0
with 0
students 0
at 0
the 0
2018 0
pre-synodal 0
meeting 0
for 0
young 0
people. 0

The 0
upcoming 0
October 0
2018 0
Synod 0
of 0
Bishops 0
guarantees 0
more 0
synodal 0
antics 0
as 0
the 0
doctrinal 0
culmination 0
of 0
the 0
“Who 0
Am 0
I 0
to 0
Judge” 0
mantra 0
and 0
the 0
recantation 0
of 0
Church 0
teaching 0
on 0
homosexuality. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
announced 0
in 0
the 0
Pre-Synodal 0
meeting 0
that 0
the 0
Church 0
will 0
be 0
listening 0
to 0
all 0
the 0
young 0
people 0
and 0
that 0
“no 0
one 0
will 0
be 0
excluded.” 0
That’s 0
code 0
language 0
that 0
the 0
Pope 0
will 0
be 0
“dialoging” 0
and 0
“accompanying” 0
and 0
“hearing” 0
the 0
pro-LBGT 0
agenda. 0

Oh, 0
the 0
providential 0
irony! 0

The 0
two 0
themes 0
of 0
the 0
upcoming 0
Synod 0
of 0
Bishops 0
in 0
Rome 0
are 0
none 0
other 0
than, 0
Youth 0
and 0
Vocations. 0

Sound 0
familiar? 0

Do 0
I 0
hear 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
Grand 0
Jury 0
Report? 0

How 0
inconvenient 0
that 0
the 0
two 0
targets 0
of 0
predatory 1
clerics 1
and 0
prelates 0
will 0
be 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
the 0
Synod 0
of 0
Bishops. 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
the 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Synod 0
on 0
Youth 0
and 0
Vocations, 0
Cardinal 0
Kevin 0
Farrell, 0
was 0
the 0
former 0
roommate 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
prolific 0
serial 0
predator 0
of 0
youth 0
and 0
seminarians 0
in 0
the 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
Church. 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
Farrell, 0
Head 0
of 0
this 0
Synod 0
on 0
Youth, 0
roomed 0
with 0
the 0
notorious 0
Cardinal 0
Theodore 0
McCarrick 0
for 0
six 0
years 0
and 0
never 0
knew 0
anything 0
about 0
McCarrick’s 0
predatory 0
behavior. 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
a 0
global 0
homosexual 0
clergy 1
predation 1
scandal 1
is 0
erupting 0
at 0
a 0
time 0
when 0
Francis 0
wants 0
the 0
Synod 0
to 0
minimize 0
that 0
nagging 0
and 0
unmerciful 0
Catholic 0
catechism 0
doctrine 0
of 0
homosexuality 0
as 0
“intrinsically 1
disordered” 1
by 0
exploiting 0
the 0
naive 0
views 0
of 0
the 0
youth 0
at 0
the 0
Synod. 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
homosexual 0
predation 0
is 0
bankrupting 0
the 0
American 0
Church 0
and 0
the 0
Instrumentum 0
Laboris, 0
the 0
working 0
document 0
of 0
this 0
Vatican 0
Synodal 0
Agenda, 0
embraces 0
the 0
relaxation 0
of 0
the 0
Church 0
teachings 0
on 0
homosexuality. 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
the 0
homosexual 0
network 0
of 0
clergy 0
and 0
prelates 0
were 0
blasted 1
as 0
predators 1
and 0
coverup 1
enablers 1
in 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
Grand 0
Jury 0
Report, 0
while 0
the 0
Instrumentum 0
Laboris 0
argues 0
that: 0

“Some 0
LGBT 0
youths, 0
through 0
various 0
contributions 0
that 0
were 0
received 0
by 0
the 0
General 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
the 0
Synod, 0
wish 0
to 0
benefit 0
from 0
greater 0
closeness 0
and 0
experience 0
greater 0
care 0
by 0
the 0
Church, 0
while 0
some 0
Bishop 0
Conferences 0
ask 0
themselves 0
what 0
to 0
suggest 0
to 0
young 0
people 0
who 0
decide 0
to 0
create 0
homosexual 0
instead 0
of 0
heterosexual 0
couples 0
and, 0
above 0
all, 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
be 0
close 0
to 0
the 0
Church.” 0
§197 0
IL 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
during 0
a 0
global 0
prelate 0
homosexual 0
coverup 0
scandal, 0
the 0
2018 0
Synodal 0
Bishop 0
Conferences 0
are 0
exploring 0
for 0
ways 0
during 0
the 0
Synod 0
to 0
discuss 0
ways 0
in 0
which 0
homosexual 0
youths 0
want 0
to 0
be 0
“closer” 0
to 0
the 0
Church! 0

How 1
inconvenient 1
that 0
since 0
2013 0
during 0
Francis’ 0
impromptu 0
airplane 0
presser 0
when 0
he 0
cleverly 0
sent 0
a 0
powerful 0
message 0
to 0
homosexual 0
clerics, 0
“Who 1
Am 1
I 1
to 1
Judge,” 1
now 0
Francis 0
must 0
judge 0
the 0
criminal 0
predatory 0
conduct 0
of 0
homosexual 0
clergy 0
and 0
prelates 0
who 0
preyed 0
on 0
youth 0
and 0
seminarians. 0

The 0
emerging 0
homosexual 0
clergy 0
scandal 0
is 0
just 0
beginning 0
to 0
unfold. 0

The 0
laity 0
will 0
learn 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
next 0
few 0
years 0
that 0
the 0
underlying 0
cause 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
scandal 0
lies 0
in 0
the 0
homosexual 0
network 0
of 0
priests, 0
bishops 0
and 0
cardinals 0
who 0
preyed 0
on 0
the 0
youth, 0
assaulted 0
seminarians, 0
promoted 0
their 0
own 0
ilk, 0
and 0
punished 0
any 0
whistleblowers 0
or 0
noncompliant 0
priests. 0

Here 0
is 0
the 0
dirty 1
secret 0
that 0
is 0
now 0
emerging. 0

Many 0
in 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
were 0
active 0
homosexuals 0
who 0
intentionally 0
relaxed 0
and 0
ignored 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
and 0
moral 0
stance 0
on 0
homosexuality. 0

The 0
personal 0
wreckage 0
brutally 1
portrayed 0
in 0
the 0
Pennsylvania 0
Grand 0
Jury 0
Report 0
is 0
the 0
direct 0
result 0
of 0
a 0
clerical 0
culture 0
which 0
embraced 0
homosexuality 0
and 0
groomed, 0
recruited, 0
and 0
assaulted 0
young 0
people 0
into 0
this 0
sordid 1
lifestyle. 0

Many 0
priests, 0
bishops, 0
and 0
cardinals 0
practiced 0
what 0
Francis 0
preached, 0
‘who 1
am 1
I 1
to 1
judge.’ 1

The 0
result? 0

A 0
litany 0
of 0
lives 0
of 0
total 0
moral, 0
physical, 0
emotional 0
devastation 1
suffered 0
by 0
victims 0
of 0
homosexual 0
clerics. 0

This 0
is 0
just 0
the 0
very 0
beginning 0
of 0
the 0
dark 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
soul 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

The 0
upcoming 0
Synod 0
and 0
its 0
embrace 0
of 0
the 0
“LGBT” 0
lifestyle 0
makes 0
a 1
mockery 1
of 0
the 0
suffering 0
of 0
the 0
clergy 0
victims 0
and 0
justifies 0
the 0
decades-old 0
scandal. 0

Be 0
forewarned 0
that 0
inviting 0
young 0
people 0
from 0
ages 0
16-29 0
to 0
the 0
Synod 0
to 0
discuss 0
vocations 0
with 0
Bishops 0
poses 1
serious 1
moral 1
and 1
physical 1
dangers 1
to 0
these 0
unsuspecting 0
youth, 0
many 0
of 0
whom 0
think 0
homosexuality 0
is 0
cool. 0

And 0
the 0
Bishops 0
know 0
it. 0

The 0
full 0
extent 0
of 0
the 0
clerical 1
predation 1
in 0
the 0
hierarchy 0
will 0
take 0
years 0
to 0
uncover. 0

Until 0
it 0
has, 0
this 0
Synod 0
must 0
be 0
cancelled 0
while 0
the 0
civil 0
authorities 0
and 0
law 0
enforcement 0
fully 0
investigate 0
the 0
breadth 0
and 0
depth 0
of 0
the 0
homosexual 0
clerical 0
predation. 0

The 0
warning 0
signs 0
and 0
rainbow 0
flags 0
are 0
flamboyantly 0
flashing 0
that 0
the 0
2018 0
Synod 0
on 0
the 0
Youth 0
and 0
Vocations 0
in 0
Rome 0
presents 0
great 0
moral 0
and 0
physical 0
exploitation 0
of 0
the 0
youth. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
Vatican, 0
the 0
chosen 0
topic 0
of 0
the 0
2018 0
Synod, 0
is 0
an 0
“expression 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
young,” 0
and 0
is 0
in 0
continuity 0
with 0
the 0
findings 0
of 0
the 0
two-fold 0
synod 0
on 0
the 0
family 0
and 0
Francis’s 0
post-synodal 0
document 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

We’ve 0
caught 0
on 0
to 0
his 0
sneaky 1
synodal 0
tactics. 0

Francis 0
cleverly 0
uses 0
the 0
synodal 0
process 0
to 0
relax 0
church 0
doctrine 0
by 0
employing 0
secular 0
tools 0
of 0
surveys 0
and 0
focus 0
groups. 0

And, 0
if 0
the 0
necessary 0
results 0
aren’t 0
computed, 0
they 0
will 0
skewer 0
the 0
results. 0

Magisterium 0
by 0
majority 0
vote 0
or 0
stuff 0
the 0
ballot 0
box. 0

The 0
only 0
compelling 0
“expression 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
pastoral 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
young” 0
belongs 0
in 0
the 0
full 0
and 0
transparent 0
cooperation 0
of 0
criminal 0
investigations 0
into 0
predatory 1
homosexual 1
predation. 1

Turn 0

the 0
documents 0
secret 0

involving 0
predation, 0
both 0
in 0
the 0
Vatican 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
chanceries 0
around 0
the 0
globe. 0

That 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
expression 0
that 0
will 0
demonstrate 0
concern 0
for 0
the 0
young. 0
