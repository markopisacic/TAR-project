In 0

news 0
conference 0
before 0
his 0
arrest, 0
Haig, 0
responding 0
to 0
the 0
documents' 0
release, 0
said 0
he 0
sold 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
to 0
Paddock 0
at 0
his 0
home 0
in 0
September 0
after 0
they 0
met 0
at 0
a 0
gun 0
show. 0

Tracer 0
ammunition 0
has 0
a 0

charge 0
that, 0
when 0

leaves 0
an 0

have 0
a 0
more 0
precise 0
idea 0
of 0
where 0
the 0
bullet 0
is 0
going. 0

Haig 0
did 0
not 0
describe 0
the 0
ammunition 0
as 0
armor-piercing. 0

Victor, 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
news 0
conference 0
at 0
his 0
Phoenix-area 0
office, 0
said 0
the 0
tracer 0
ammunition 0
that 0
Haig 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
"was 0
not 0
modified 0
in 0
any 0
way 0
... 0
from 0
manufacturer's 0
specs." 0

But 0
in 0
Friday's 0
criminal 0
complaint, 0
investigators 0
say 0
Haig 0
and 0
an 0
associate 0
also 0
claimed 0
they 0
sold 0
to 0
Paddock 0
other 0
ammunition 0
-- 0
four 0
or 0
five 0
10-round 0
packages 0

incendiary 0
ammunition 0
-- 0
at 0
a 0
Las 0
Vegas 0
gun 0
show 0
in 0
August. 0

It's 0
not 0
clear 0
from 0
the 0
complaint 0
whether 0
the 0
two 0
armor-piercing 0
rounds 0
with 0
the 0
incendiary 0
capsule 0
are 0
from 0
the 0
packages 0
Haig 0
allegedly 0
told 0
investigators 0
he 0
sold 0
Paddock 0
at 0
the 0
gun 0
show. 0

The 0
complaint 0
also 0
does 0
not 0
say 0
whether 0
Paddock 0
fired 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
ammunition 0
that 0
he 0
bought 0
from 0
