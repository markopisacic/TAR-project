It's 1
incredible 1
the 0
amount 0
of 0
hypocrisy 0
Senator 0
Dianne 0
Feinstein 0
puts 0
on 0
display 0
for 1
the 1
American 1
people 1

see, 1
and 0
yet, 0
the 0
people 0
in 0
her 0
state 0
continue 0
to 0
put 0
her 0
in 0
office. 0

Her 0
latest 0
antics 0
are 0
to 1
point 1
to 1
a 1
more 1
than 1
30 1
year 1
old 1
claim 1
that 1
Supreme 1
Court 1
nominee 1
Brett 1
Kavanaugh 1
engaged 1
in 1
sexual 1
misconduct 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
in 1
high 1
school 1
and 1
somehow 1
claim 1
that 1
he 1
may 1
have 1
committed 1
a 1
crime 1
while 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
remaining 1
silent 1
on 1
two 1
women 1
who 1
have 1
accused 1
Rep. 1
Keith 1
Ellison, 1
who 1
is 1
running 1
for 1
Attorney 1
General 1
in 1
Minnesota, 1
of 1
abusing 1
them, 1
one 1
of 1
them 1
making 1
the 1
claim 1
this 1
year. 1

“I 0
have 0
received 0
information 0
from 0
an 0
individual 0
concerning 0
the 0
nomination 0
of 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh 0
to 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court,” 0
Senator 0
Feinstein 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
surprise 0
statement. 0

“That 0
individual 0
strongly 0
requested 0
confidentiality, 0
declined 0
to 0
come 0
forward 0
or 0
press 0
the 0
matter 0
further, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
honored 0
that 0
decision. 0

I 0
have, 0
however, 0
referred 0
the 0
matter 0
to 0
federal 0
investigative 0
authorities.” 0

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
reality 0
is 0
that 0
bringing 0
something 0
like 0
this 0
up 0
more 0
than 0
30 0
years 0
later 0
is 0
ridiculous, 1

A 0
spokesperson 0
for 0
Feinstein 0
declined 0
Fox 0
News’ 0
request 0
to 0
elaborate 0
on 0
the 0
lawmaker’s 0
statement, 0
but 0
there 0
has 0
been 0
much 0
speculation 0
that 0
she 0
is 0
referring 0
to 0
a 0
secret 0
letter 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
intrigue 0
on 0
Capitol 0
Hill 0
over 0
the 0
last 0
few 0
days. 0

A 0
source 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
confirmation 0
proceedings 0
told 0
Fox 0
News 0
that 0
Feinstein 0
received 0
the 0
letter 0
back 0
in 0
July, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
make 0
its 0
existence 0
known 0
publicly 0
until 0
Thursday. 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
report 0
by 0
The 0
Intercept, 0
the 0
letter 0
was 0
relayed 0
to 0
lawmakers 0
by 0
an 0
individual 0
affiliated 0
with 0
Stanford 0
University 0
and 0
concerns 0
an 0
incident 0
involving 0
the 0
53-year-old 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
a 0
woman 0
while 0
they 0
were 0
in 0
high 0
school. 0

According 0
to 0
two 0
officials 0
who 0
spoke 0
anonymously 0
with 0
the 0
New 0
York 0
Times, 0
the 0
incident 0
involved 0
possible 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
between 0
Kavanaugh 0
and 0
the 0
woman. 0

The 0
letter 0
reportedly 0
was 0
given 0
to 0
Feinstein 0
by 0
Rep. 0
Anna 0
Eshoo, 0
D-Calif., 0
but 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
publicly 0
disclosed 0
by 0
senators 0
who 0
have 0
seen 0
the 0
document. 0

Sen. 0
Dick 0
Durbin, 0
D-Ill., 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
letter 0
in 0
question 0
has 0
been 0
referred 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
for 0
investigation. 0

The 0
FBI 0
conducts 0
background 0
checks 0
on 0
all 0
major 0
government 0
appointees, 0
including 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
nominees. 0

“Upon 0
receipt 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
September 0
12, 0
we 0
included 0
it 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
Judge 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
background 0
file, 0
as 0
per 0
the 0
standard 0
process,” 0
the 0
FBI 0
said 0
in 0
a 0
statement. 0

The 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
called 0
this 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
last 1
minute 1
gambit, 1
and 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
correct. 0

In 0
fact, 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
no 0
plans 0
to 0
pursue 0
any 0
investigation 0
regarding 0
the 0
allegation. 0

According 0
to 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post: 0

According 0
to 0
a 0
person 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
matter, 0
the 0
FBI 0
does 0
not 0
now 0
plan 0
to 0
launch 0
a 0
criminal 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
matter, 0
which 0
would 0
normally 0
be 0
handled 0
by 0
local 0
authorities, 0
if 0
it 0
was 0
within 0
the 0
statute 0
of 0
limitations. 0

The 0
FBI 0
instead 0
passed 0
the 0
material 0
to 0
the 0
White 0
House, 0
as 0
an 0
update 0
to 0
Kavanaugh's 0
background 0
check, 0
which 0
already 0
had 0
been 0
completed, 0
the 0
person 0
said. 0

The 0
move 0
is 0
similar 0
to 0
what 0
the 0
bureau 0
did 0
when 0
allegations 0
were 0
leveled 0
against 0
former 0
White 0
House 0
aide 0
Rob 0
Porter. 0

... 0
Senate 0
Majority 0
Whip 0
John 0
Cornyn 0
(R-Texas) 0
dismissed 0
the 0
controversy 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“Let 0
me 0
get 0
this 0
straight: 0
this 0
is 0
[a] 0
statement 0
about 0
[a] 0
secret 0
letter 0
regarding 0
a 0
secret 0
matter 0
and 0
an 0
unidentified 0
person. 0

Right,” 0
he 0
tweeted 0
sarcastically. 0

“I 0
will 0
add: 0
the 0
FBI 0
already 0
performed 0
and 0
has 0
reported 0
on 0
a 0
background 0
investigation 0
on 0
the 0
nominee 0
and 0
thhttp://ericposner.com/is-brett-kavanaugh-an-originalist/is 0
has 0
been 0
made 0
available 0
to 0
all 0
Senators 0
on 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee,” 0
Cornyn 0
wrote. 0

Exactly! 0

This 0
is 0
political 1
theater 1
over 0
a 0
man 0
who 0
is 0
not 0
an 0
originalist 0
and 0
not 0
a 0
strict 0
Constitutionalist. 0

He's 1
a 1
precedence 1
man! 1

He's 0
said 0
it 0
over 0
and 0
over! 0

If 0
they 0
wanted 0
something 0
on 0
the 0
guy, 0
why 1
don't 1
they 1
bring 1
up 1
his 1
involvement 1
in 1
the 1
Vince 1
Foster 1
cover-up? 1

Now, 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
something 0
to 0
really 0
look 0
into, 0
but 0
not 0
with 0
the 1
corrupt 1
DOJ 1
and 1
FBI 1
we 0
currently 0
have. 0

Of 0
course, 0
if 1
they 1
did, 1
then 1
someone 1
might 1
actually 1
have 1
to 1
act 1
on 1
something 1
that 1
actually 1
was 1
a 1
crime. 1
