“I 1 200 4

“The 0 200 7

the 0 200 7

in 0 200 7
a 0 200 7

“He 0 200 8

which 0 200 8
we 0 200 8
promptly 0 200 8
shared 0 200 8
with 0 200 8
him.” 0 200 8
The 0 200 8
congressman 0 200 8
wasn’t 0 200 8
sure 0 200 8
why 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
ADL 0 200 8
wrote 0 200 8
that 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
had 0 200 8
been 0 200 8
misquoted 0 200 8
in 0 200 8
his 0 200 8
praise 0 200 8
for 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
anti-Semite, 0 200 8
and 0 200 8
said 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
wasn’t 0 200 8
sure 0 200 8
if 0 200 8
someone 0 200 8
from 0 200 8
his 0 200 8
office 0 200 8
had 0 200 8
told 0 200 8
the 0 200 8
ADL 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
was 0 200 8
misquoted, 0 200 8
he 0 200 8
told 0 200 8
The 0 200 8

Foundation 0 200 8
on 0 200 8
Sunday. 0 200 8

“I 0 200 9
think 0 200 9
that 0 200 9
was 0 200 9
what 0 200 9
they 0 200 9
wanted 0 200 9
to 0 200 9
write. 0 200 9

Nah, 0 200 10
I 0 200 10
don’t 0 200 10
have 0 200 10
no 0 200 10
problems 0 200 10
with 0 200 10
Farrakhan, 0 200 10
I 0 200 10
don’t 0 200 10
spend 0 200 10
a 0 200 10
whole 0 200 10
lot 0 200 10
of 0 200 10
my 0 200 10
time 0 200 10
dealing 0 200 10
with 0 200 10
those 0 200 10
kind 0 200 10
of 0 200 10
things,” 0 200 10
Davis 0 200 10
said. 0 200 10

“That’s 0 200 11
just 0 200 11
one 0 200 11
segment 0 200 11
of 0 200 11
what 0 200 11
goes 0 200 11
on 0 200 11
in 0 200 11
our 0 200 11
world. 0 200 11

The 1 200 12
world 1 200 12
is 1 200 12
so 1 200 12
much 1 200 12
bigger 1 200 12
than 1 200 12
Farrakhan 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
the 1 200 12
Jewish 1 200 12
question 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
his 1 200 12
position 1 200 12
on 1 200 12
that 1 200 12
and 1 200 12
so 1 200 12
forth. 1 200 12

For 0 200 13
those 0 200 13
heavy 0 200 13
into 0 200 13
it, 0 200 13
that’s 0 200 13
their 0 200 13
thing, 0 200 13
but 0 200 13
it 0 200 13
ain’t 0 200 13
my 0 200 13
thing,” 0 200 13
he 0 200 13
said 0 200 13

The 0 200 14
term 0 200 14
"Jewish 0 200 14
Question" 0 200 14
is 0 200 14
largely 0 200 14
used 0 200 14
by 0 200 14
anti-Semites. 0 200 14

So 0 200 15
Davis 0 200 15
then 0 200 15
sorta 0 200 15
disavowed 0 200 15
his 0 200 15
own 0 200 15
statements. 0 200 15

J 0 200 16
Street 0 200 16
endorsed 0 200 16
him. 0 200 16

And 0 200 17
then 0 200 17
he 0 200 17
talked 0 200 17
to 0 200 17
the 0 200 17

Louis 0 200 18
Farrakhan, 0 200 18
a 1 200 18
notorious 1 200 18
racist 1 200 18
and 1 200 18
anti-Semite, 1 200 18
does 0 200 18
“outstanding 1 200 18
work” 1 200 18
but 0 200 18
doesn’t 0 200 18
agree 0 200 18
with 0 200 18
Farrakhan’s 0 200 18
positions 0 200 18
that 0 200 18
white 1 200 18
people 1 200 18
are 1 200 18
“devils” 1 200 18
and 1 200 18
Jewish 1 200 18
people 1 200 18
are 1 200 18

Progress! 0 200 19

"I 1 200 20
don’t 1 200 20
spend 1 200 20
a 1 200 20
lot 1 200 20
of 1 200 20
time, 1 200 20
I 1 200 20
buy 1 200 20
Final 1 200 20
Call 1 200 20
when 1 200 20
I 1 200 20
see 1 200 20
them. 1 200 20

I’ve 1 200 21
been 1 200 21
to 1 200 21
Saviour’s 1 200 21
Day, 1 200 21
I’ve 1 200 21
read, 1 200 21
I’ve 1 200 21
been 1 200 21
a 1 200 21
fan 1 200 21
of 1 200 21
Elijah 1 200 21
Muhammad, 1 200 21
so 1 200 21
those 1 200 21
are 1 200 21
my 1 200 21
positions, 1 200 21
but 1 200 21
I 1 200 21
do 1 200 21
disagree 1 200 21
with 1 200 21
the 1 200 21
notion 1 200 21
that 1 200 21
white 1 200 21
people 1 200 21
are 1 200 21
devils.” 1 200 21

I 1 200 22
wonder 1 200 22
how 1 200 22
far 1 200 22
a 1 200 22
white 1 200 22
congressman 1 200 22
would 1 200 22
get 1 200 22
saying, 1 200 22
"I 1 200 22
attended 1 200 22
the 1 200 22
Klavern, 1 200 22
but 1 200 22
I 1 200 22
don't 1 200 22
agree 1 200 22
with 1 200 22
the 1 200 22
KKK's 1 200 22
views 1 200 22
about 1 200 22
black 1 200 22
people." 1 200 22

But 0 200 23
that's 0 200 23
Rep. 0 200 23
Davis' 0 200 23
current 0 200 23
views. 0 200 23

He 0 200 24
likes 0 200 24
a 0 200 24
racist 0 200 24
hate 0 200 24
group. 0 200 24

But 0 200 25
doesn't 0 200 25
believe 0 200 25
white 0 200 25
people 0 200 25
are 0 200 25
devils 1 200 25
or 0 200 25
Jews 0 200 25
are 0 200 25
satanic. 1 200 25

Whoever 0 200 26
the 0 200 26
JTA 0 200 26
has 0 200 26
on 0 200 26
the 0 200 26

going 0 200 26
to 0 200 26
be 0 200 26

again. 0 200 26

But 0 200 27
this 0 200 27
is 0 200 27

of 0 200 27
