I’ve 1 67 3
been 1 67 3

his 1 67 3

“I 1 67 4

as 1 67 4
an 1 67 4
aberration 1 67 4
or 1 67 4
anything, 1 67 4
I 1 67 4
regard 1 67 4
him 1 67 4
as 1 67 4
an 1 67 4
outstanding 1 67 4
human 1 67 4
being 1 67 4
who 1 67 4
commands 1 67 4

individuals 1 67 4
who 1 67 4
are 1 67 4
learned 1 67 4

he 1 67 4

he 1 67 4
emphasized 1 67 4
later. 1 67 4

Then 0 67 5

a 0 67 5
statement 0 67 5

And 0 67 6
then 0 67 6
Davis 0 67 6
got 0 67 6
right 0 67 6
back 0 67 6
to 0 67 6
talking 0 67 6
to 0 67 6
the 0 67 6

the 0 67 6
disavowal. 0 67 6

“The 0 67 7

that 0 67 7

that 0 67 7

the 0 67 7
ADL 0 67 7
official 0 67 7
told 0 67 7
JTA 0 67 7
in 0 67 7
a 0 67 7
statement. 0 67 7

“He 0 67 8
expressed 0 67 8
an 0 67 8
interest 0 67 8
in 0 67 8
seeing 0 67 8
some 0 67 8
of 0 67 8
the 0 67 8
latest 0 67 8
statements 0 67 8
made 0 67 8
by 0 67 8
Farrakhan 0 67 8
vis-a-vis 0 67 8
Jews, 0 67 8
which 0 67 8
we 0 67 8
promptly 0 67 8
shared 0 67 8
with 0 67 8
him.” 0 67 8
The 0 67 8
congressman 0 67 8
wasn’t 0 67 8
sure 0 67 8
why 0 67 8
the 0 67 8
ADL 0 67 8
wrote 0 67 8
that 0 67 8
he 0 67 8
had 0 67 8
been 0 67 8
misquoted 0 67 8
in 0 67 8
his 0 67 8
praise 0 67 8
for 0 67 8
the 0 67 8
anti-Semite, 0 67 8
and 0 67 8
said 0 67 8
he 0 67 8
wasn’t 0 67 8
sure 0 67 8
if 0 67 8
someone 0 67 8
from 0 67 8
his 0 67 8
office 0 67 8
had 0 67 8
told 0 67 8
the 0 67 8
ADL 0 67 8
he 0 67 8
was 0 67 8
misquoted, 0 67 8
he 0 67 8
told 0 67 8
The 0 67 8
Daily 0 67 8
Caller 0 67 8
News 0 67 8
Foundation 0 67 8
on 0 67 8
Sunday. 0 67 8

“I 0 67 9
think 0 67 9
that 0 67 9
was 0 67 9
what 0 67 9
they 0 67 9
wanted 0 67 9
to 0 67 9
write. 0 67 9

Nah, 0 67 10
I 0 67 10
don’t 0 67 10
have 0 67 10
no 0 67 10
problems 0 67 10
with 0 67 10
Farrakhan, 0 67 10
I 0 67 10
don’t 0 67 10
spend 0 67 10
a 0 67 10
whole 0 67 10
lot 0 67 10
of 0 67 10
my 0 67 10
time 0 67 10
dealing 0 67 10
with 0 67 10
those 0 67 10
kind 0 67 10
of 0 67 10
things,” 0 67 10
Davis 0 67 10
said. 0 67 10

“That’s 0 67 11
just 0 67 11
one 0 67 11
segment 0 67 11
of 0 67 11
what 0 67 11
goes 0 67 11
on 0 67 11
in 0 67 11
our 0 67 11
world. 0 67 11

The 1 67 12
world 1 67 12
is 1 67 12
so 1 67 12
much 1 67 12
bigger 1 67 12
than 1 67 12
Farrakhan 1 67 12
and 1 67 12
the 1 67 12
Jewish 1 67 12
question 1 67 12
and 1 67 12
his 1 67 12
position 1 67 12
on 1 67 12
that 1 67 12
and 1 67 12
so 1 67 12
forth. 1 67 12

For 0 67 13
those 0 67 13
heavy 0 67 13
into 0 67 13
it, 0 67 13
that’s 0 67 13
their 0 67 13
thing, 0 67 13
but 0 67 13
it 0 67 13
ain’t 0 67 13
my 0 67 13
thing,” 0 67 13
he 0 67 13
said 0 67 13

The 0 67 14
term 0 67 14
"Jewish 0 67 14
Question" 0 67 14
is 0 67 14
largely 0 67 14
used 0 67 14
by 0 67 14
anti-Semites. 0 67 14

So 0 67 15
Davis 0 67 15
then 0 67 15
sorta 0 67 15
disavowed 0 67 15
his 0 67 15
own 0 67 15
statements. 0 67 15

J 0 67 16
Street 0 67 16
endorsed 0 67 16
him. 0 67 16

And 0 67 17
then 0 67 17
he 0 67 17
talked 0 67 17
to 0 67 17
the 0 67 17

Farrakhan, 0 67 18
a 1 67 18
notorious 1 67 18

and 1 67 18
anti-Semite, 1 67 18
does 0 67 18
“outstanding 1 67 18

but 0 67 18
doesn’t 0 67 18
agree 0 67 18
with 0 67 18
Farrakhan’s 0 67 18
positions 0 67 18
that 0 67 18
white 1 67 18
people 1 67 18
are 1 67 18
“devils” 1 67 18
and 1 67 18
Jewish 1 67 18

are 1 67 18

Progress! 0 67 19

"I 1 67 20
don’t 1 67 20
spend 1 67 20
a 1 67 20
lot 1 67 20
of 1 67 20
time, 1 67 20
I 1 67 20
buy 1 67 20
Final 1 67 20
Call 1 67 20
when 1 67 20
I 1 67 20
see 1 67 20
them. 1 67 20

I’ve 1 67 21
been 1 67 21
to 1 67 21
Saviour’s 1 67 21
Day, 1 67 21
I’ve 1 67 21
read, 1 67 21
I’ve 1 67 21
been 1 67 21
a 1 67 21
fan 1 67 21
of 1 67 21
Elijah 1 67 21
Muhammad, 1 67 21
so 1 67 21
those 1 67 21
are 1 67 21
my 1 67 21
positions, 1 67 21
but 1 67 21
I 1 67 21
do 1 67 21
disagree 1 67 21
with 1 67 21
the 1 67 21
notion 1 67 21
that 1 67 21
white 1 67 21
people 1 67 21
are 1 67 21
devils.” 1 67 21

I 1 67 22
wonder 1 67 22
how 1 67 22
far 1 67 22
a 1 67 22
white 1 67 22
congressman 1 67 22
would 1 67 22
get 1 67 22
saying, 1 67 22
"I 1 67 22
attended 1 67 22
the 1 67 22
Klavern, 1 67 22
but 1 67 22
I 1 67 22
don't 1 67 22
agree 1 67 22
with 1 67 22
the 1 67 22
KKK's 1 67 22
views 1 67 22
about 1 67 22
black 1 67 22
people." 1 67 22

But 0 67 23
that's 0 67 23
Rep. 0 67 23
Davis' 0 67 23
current 0 67 23
views. 0 67 23

He 0 67 24
likes 0 67 24
a 0 67 24
racist 0 67 24
hate 0 67 24
group. 0 67 24

But 0 67 25
doesn't 0 67 25
believe 0 67 25
white 0 67 25
people 0 67 25
are 0 67 25
devils 1 67 25
or 0 67 25
Jews 0 67 25
are 0 67 25
satanic. 1 67 25

Whoever 0 67 26
the 0 67 26
JTA 0 67 26
has 0 67 26
on 0 67 26
the 0 67 26
"explain 0 67 26
away 0 67 26
Farrakhan's 0 67 26
Dem 0 67 26
fandom" 0 67 26
beat 0 67 26
is 0 67 26
going 0 67 26
to 0 67 26
be 0 67 26
busy 0 67 26
again. 0 67 26

But 0 67 27
this 0 67 27
is 0 67 27
typical 0 67 27
of 0 67 27
the 0 67 27
Dems 0 67 27
and 0 67 27
their 0 67 27
useful 1 67 27
idiots. 1 67 27

And 0 67 28
J 0 67 28
Street 0 67 28
is 0 67 28
on 0 67 28
record 0 67 28
as 0 67 28
endorsing 0 67 28
a 1 67 28
