Let 0
me 0

they 1

themselves 1
under 1

I 0

I 0

the 0

“was 0

about 1
it,” 1

“There’s 1

it 1

Kate’s 0

Brad 0

that 0

with 0

the 0

met 0
every 0
standard 0

The 0

was 0
“an 0

failure 1
by 0

No 0

Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate, 0
54, 0
is 0
a 0
seven-time 0
felon 0
and 0
has 0
been 0
deported 0
five 0
times. 0

In 0
2015 0
federal 0
authorities 0
sought 0
to 0
detain 0
him 0
for 0
deportation. 0

San 0

Ross 0

chose 0
to 0
defy 0
the 0
feds 0
and 0
release 0
the 0
Mexican 0
national. 0

On 0
July 0
1, 0
2015, 0
the 0
criminal 0
illegal 0
picked 0
up 0
a 0
Sig 0
Sauer 0
.40 0
caliber 0
pistol, 0
stolen 0
from 0
a 0
Bureau 0
of 0
Land 0
Management 0
officer, 0
and 0
fired 0
the 0
shot 0
that 0
killed 0
Kate 0
Steinle, 0
only 0
32 0
years 0
old. 0

The 0
Mexican 0
nation 0
and 0
career 0
criminal 0
enjoyed 1
all 1
the 1
rights 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
legal 1
system, 1
the 0
presumption 0
of 0
innocence, 0
and 0
a 0
high-profile 0
defense 0
attorney 0
funded 0
by 0
American 0
taxpayers. 0

During 0
the 0
trial, 0
former 0
vice 0
presidential 0
candidate 0
Matt 0
Gonzalez 0
claimed 0
that 0
Garcia 1
Zarate’s 1
background 1
and 1
nationality 1
played 1
a 1
role 1
in 1
his 1
prosecution. 1

As 0
Gonzalez 0
argued, 0
“If 1
this 1
was 1
a 1
college 1
student 1
or 1
Swedish 1
kid 1
would 1
he 1
be 1
charged 1
with 1
murder?” 1

That 0
sort 0
of 0
politically 1
correct 1
nonsense 1
plays 0
well 0
in 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
so 0
any 0
observer 0
of 0
the 0
case 0
could 0
be 0
forgiven 0
for 0
believing 0
that 0
prosecution 0
and 0
defense 0
both 0
got 0
the 0
outcome 0
they 0
wanted, 0
regardless 0
of 0
the 0
tragedy 0
for 0
the 0
Steinle 0
family. 0

The 0
felony 0
firearms 0
charge, 0
the 0
only 0
charge 0
on 0
which 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
was 0
found 0
guilty, 0
carries 0
a 0
sentence 0
of 0
16 0
months 0
to 0
3 0
years. 0

Since 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
has 0
been 0
languishing 0
in 0
jail, 0
the 0
authorities 0
could 0
commute 0
any 0
sentence 0
to 0
time 0
served 0
and 0
he 0
could 0
walk 0
free 0
within 0
weeks. 0

San 0
Francisco 0
is 0
not 0
likely 0
to 0
hand 0
the 0
felon 0
over 0
to 0
ICE 0
for 0
deportation. 0

Should 0
that 0
happen, 0
Garcia 0
Zarate 0
has 0
already 0
proved 0
five 0
times 0
that 0
anybody 0
can 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
violating 0
U.S. 0
immigration 0
law. 0

He 1
has 1
already 1
proved 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
sanctuary 1
state 1
of 1
California, 1
false-documented 1
illegals 1
are 1
a 1
privileged 1
class. 1

Jose 0
Ines 0
Garcia 0
Zarate, 0
or 0
whatever 0
his 0
real 0
name 0
is, 0
has 0
also 0
proved 0
that 0
a 0
career 0
criminal 0
who 0
is 0
not 0
even 0
supposed 0
to 0
be 0
in 0
the 0
country 0
can 0
literally 0
get 0
away 0
with 0
murder 0
in 0
broad 0
daylight. 0

When 0
that 0
happens, 0
the 0
killer’s 0
public 0
defender 0
will 0
call 0
it 0
a 0
“vindication 0
for 0
the 0
rights 0
of 0
immigrants.” 0

In 0
San 0
Francisco, 0
and 0
across 0
California, 0
this 0
verdict 0
will 0
surely 0
give 0
new 0
meaning 0
to 0
the 0
cry 0
of 0
“no 0
justice, 0
no 0
peace.” 0
