From 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
this 0
case, 0
it 0
was 0
clear 0
that 0
Guyger 0
was 0
receiving 0
special 0
treatment 0
from 0
law 0
enforcement. 0

One 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
glaring 1
instances 0
showing 0
her 0
privilege 0
was 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
Texas 0
Rangers 0
said 0
in 0
their 0
report 0
that 0
Jean 0
refused 0
to 0
obey 0
Guyger’s 0
“verbal 0
commands.” 0
Had 0
anyone 0
else 0
but 0
a 0
cop 0
walked 0
into 0
an 0
apartment 0
and 0
killed 0
an 0
innocent 1
man, 0
do 0
you 0
believe 0
that 0
investigators 0
would 0
have 0
said 0
anything 0
like 0
this? 0

Attorney 0
Stephen 0
Le 0
Brocq, 0
who 0
operates 0
a 0
law 0
firm 0
in 0
the 0
North 0
Texas 0
area 0
sums 0
up 0
the 0
treatment 0
of 0
Guyger 0
perfectly 0
when 0
he 0
says 0
that 0
“The 0
affidavit 0
isn’t 0
written 0
objectively, 0
not 0
at 0
the 0
slightest. 0

As 0
stated 0
before, 0
they 0
are 0
usually 0
wholly 0
against 0
the 0
accused. 0

An 0
objective 0
view 0
of 0
the 0
information 0
related 0
by 0
the 0
officer 0
would 0
be 0
proper, 0
in 0
my 0
opinion. 0

This 0
affidavit 0
states 0
facts 0
based 0
upon 0
the 0
word 0
of 0
the 0
person 0
it 0
seeks 0
to 0
accuse 0
of 0
criminal 0
wrongdoing.” 0

What’s 0
more, 0
according 0
to 0
WFAA, 0
who 0
obtained 0
affidavits 0
for 0
all 0
of 0
the 0
search 0
warrants 0
involved 0
in 0
the 0
case, 0
none 0
of 0
them 0
involved 0
the 0
search 0
of 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment. 0

For 0
those 0
who 0
don’t 0
recall, 0
police 0
egregiously 1
released 0
the 0
search 0
warrant 0
findings 0
of 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
on 0
the 0
day 0
his 0
family 0
buried 0
his 0
dead 0
body. 0

They 0
attempted 0
to 0
assassinate 0
Jean’s 0
character 0
by 0
claiming 0
they 0
found 0
less 0
than 0
a 0
half 0
ounce 0
of 0
weed 0
in 0
his 0
apartment. 0

However, 0
they 0
failed 0
miserably 1
at 0
it. 0

One 0
thing 0
in 0
particular, 0
however, 0
stood 0
out 0
to 0
those 0
paying 0
attention 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
the 0
fact 0
the 0
police 0
didn’t 0
release 0
any 0
information 0
on 0
what 0
they 0
found 0
in 0
Guyger’s 0
apartment. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
information 0
currently 0
available, 0
that’s 0
because 0
they 0
didn’t 0
search 0
it. 0

According 0
to 0
WFAA, 0
there 0
were 0
five 0
search 0
warrants 0
issued 0
in 0
the 0
case—none 0
of 0
which 0
were 0
for 0
the 0
killer’s 0
apartment. 0

As 0
WFAA 0
reports: 0

Two 0
of 0
the 0

the 0

their 0

An 0

and 0
downloaded 0
the 0

from 0
the 0

A 0

warrant 0
gave 0

the 0
authority 0
to 0
enter 0
Jean’s 0
apartment 0
and 0
collect 0
additional 0
evidence. 0

A 0

that 0

of 0
his 0

made 0

of 0

in 0
the 0

A 0

p.m. 0

11 0
p.m. 0
on 0
the 0
night 0
of 0
the 0
shooting. 0

An 0

containing 0
the 0

an 0

and 0
a 0
“lock 0

report 0

Now, 0
even 0
if 0
police 0
would 0
try 0
to 0
search 0
the 0
killer 1
cop’s 1
apartment, 0
it’s 0
too 0
late. 0

On 0
Sunday, 0
apartment 0
staff 0
notified 0
residents 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
that 0
Guyger 0
“has 0
vacated 0
her 0
apartment 0
and 0
no 0
longer 0
resides 0
at 0
our 1
community.” 1

A 0
manager 0
at 0
the 0
complex 0
declined 0
to 0
indicate 0
exactly 0
when 0
Guyger 0
moved 0
out 0
and 0
if 0
she 0
left 0
the 0
premises 0
voluntarily, 0
the 0
Dallas 0
Morning 0
News 0
reports. 0

While 0
residents 0
can 0
certainly 0
sleep 0
better 0
knowing 0
that 0
they 0
don’t 0
have 0
to 0
fear 1
a 0
killer 1
cop 1
walking 0
into 0
their 0
apartment 0
and 0
murdering 0
them, 0
the 0
family 0
of 0
Botham 0
Jean 0
likely 0
sees 0
this 0
as 0
one 0
more 0
instance 0
of 0
injustice. 0

Mother 0

Allison 0
Jean, 0
says 0
the 0
“smear” 0
of 0
her 0

is 0
unacceptable. 0

“It 0
is 0

that 0
we 0
recognize 0
that 0
lives 0
matter, 0
my 0
son’s 0
life 0
