US 0 35 2
President 0 35 2
Donald 0 35 2
Trump 0 35 2
initiated 0 35 2
an 0 35 2
important 0 35 2
change 0 35 2
in 0 35 2
US 0 35 2
policy 0 35 2

No, 0 35 3
in 0 35 3
his 0 35 3
speech 0 35 3
decertifying 0 35 3
Iran’s 0 35 3
compliance 0 35 3
with 0 35 3
the 0 35 3
nuclear 0 35 3
accord 0 35 3

struck 0 35 3
with 0 35 3
his 0 35 3
predecessor 0 35 3
Barack 0 35 3
Obama, 0 35 3
Trump 0 35 3
didn’t 0 35 3
announce 0 35 3
a 0 35 3
new 0 35 3
strategy 0 35 3
for 0 35 3
preventing 0 35 3
Iran 0 35 3
from 0 35 3

nuclear 0 35 3

Trump’s 0 35 4
move 0 35 4
was 0 35 4
not 0 35 4
operational. 0 35 4

It 0 35 5
was 0 35 5
directional. 0 35 5

In 0 35 6
his 0 35 6
address 0 35 6
Friday, 0 35 6
Trump 0 35 6
changed 0 35 6
the 0 35 6
policy 0 35 6
dynamics 0 35 6
that 0 35 6
dictate 0 35 6
US 0 35 6
policy 0 35 6
on 0 35 6
Iran. 0 35 6

For 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
first 0 35 7
time 0 35 7
since 0 35 7
2009, 0 35 7
when 0 35 7
Obama 0 35 7
backed 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
murderous 1 35 7
regime 1 35 7
in 0 35 7
Tehran, 0 35 7
spurning 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
millions 0 35 7
of 0 35 7
Iranians 0 35 7
who 0 35 7
rose 0 35 7
up 0 35 7
in 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
Green 0 35 7
Revolution, 0 35 7
Trump 0 35 7
opened 0 35 7
up 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
possibility 0 35 7
that 0 35 7
the 0 35 7
US 0 35 7
may 0 35 7
begin 0 35 7
to 0 35 7
base 0 35 7
its 0 35 7
policies 0 35 7
toward 0 35 7
Iran 0 35 7
on 0 35 7
reality. 0 35 7

Trump 0 35 8
began 0 35 8
his 0 35 8
remarks 0 35 8
by 0 35 8
setting 0 35 8
out 0 35 8
Iran’s 1 35 8
long 1 35 8
rap 1 35 8
sheet 1 35 8
of 1 35 8
aggression 1 35 8
against 1 35 8
America. 1 35 8

Starting 0 35 9
with 0 35 9
the 0 35 9
US 0 35 9
embassy 0 35 9
seizure 1 35 9
and 1 35 9
hostage 1 35 9
crisis, 1 35 9
Trump 1 35 9
described 1 35 9
Iran’s 1 35 9
crimes 1 35 9
and 1 35 9
acts 1 35 9
of 1 35 9
war 1 35 9
against 1 35 9
America 1 35 9
in 0 35 9
greater 0 35 9
detail 0 35 9
than 0 35 9
any 0 35 9
of 0 35 9
his 0 35 9
predecessors 0 35 9
ever 0 35 9

did. 0 35 10
Trump’s 0 35 10
dossier 0 35 10
was 0 35 10
interlaced 0 35 10
with 0 35 10
condemnations 0 35 10
of 0 35 10
the 0 35 10
regime’s 0 35 10
repression 0 35 10
of 0 35 10
its 0 35 10
own 0 35 10
people. 0 35 10

By 0 35 11
merging 0 35 11
Iran’s 0 35 11
external 0 35 11
aggression 0 35 11
with 0 35 11
its 0 35 11
internal 0 35 11
repression, 0 35 11
Trump 0 35 11
signaled 0 35 11
a 0 35 11
readiness 0 35 11
to 0 35 11
drive 0 35 11
a 0 35 11
wedge 0 35 11
– 0 35 11
or 0 35 11
expand 0 35 11
the 0 35 11
wedge 0 35 11
– 0 35 11
between 0 35 11
the 1 35 11
authoritarian 1 35 11
theocrats 1 35 11
that 0 35 11
rule 0 35 11
Iran 0 35 11
and 0 35 11
the 0 35 11
largely 0 35 11
secular, 0 35 11
multiethnic 0 35 11
and 0 35 11
pro-Western 0 35 11
people 0 35 11
of 0 35 11

Iran. 0 35 12
Trump 0 35 12
then 0 35 12
turned 0 35 12
his 0 35 12
attention 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
Iran’s 0 35 12
illicit 0 35 12
ballistic 0 35 12
missile 0 35 12
program, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
sponsorship 1 35 12
of 1 35 12
terrorism, 1 35 12
including 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
links 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
al-Qaida, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
aggression 0 35 12
against 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
neighbors, 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
aggressive 0 35 12
acts 0 35 12
against 0 35 12
maritime 0 35 12
traffic 0 35 12
in 0 35 12
the 0 35 12
Straits 0 35 12
of 0 35 12
Hormuz, 0 35 12
and 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
bids 0 35 12
to 0 35 12
destabilize 0 35 12
and 0 35 12
control 0 35 12
large 0 35 12
swaths 0 35 12
of 0 35 12
the 0 35 12
Middle 0 35 12
East 0 35 12
through 0 35 12
its 0 35 12
proxies. 0 35 12

It 0 35 13
is 0 35 13
notable 0 35 13
that 0 35 13
these 0 35 13
remarks 0 35 13
preceded 0 35 13
Trump’s 0 35 13
discussion 0 35 13
of 0 35 13
the 0 35 13
nuclear 0 35 13
deal 0 35 13
– 0 35 13
which 0 35 13
was 0 35 13
the 0 35 13
ostensible 0 35 13
subject 0 35 13
of 0 35 13
his 0 35 13

speech. 0 35 14
Before 0 35 14
Trump 0 35 14
discussed 0 35 14
Iran’s 0 35 14
breaches 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
nuclear 0 35 14
deal, 0 35 14
he 0 35 14
first 0 35 14
demonstrated 0 35 14
that 0 35 14
contrary 0 35 14
to 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
expressed 0 35 14
views 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
his 0 35 14
top 0 35 14
advisers, 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
is 0 35 14
impossible 0 35 14
to 0 35 14
limit 0 35 14
a 0 35 14
realistic 0 35 14
discussion 0 35 14
of 0 35 14
the 1 35 14
threat 1 35 14
Iran 1 35 14
constitutes 1 35 14
to 1 35 14
US 1 35 14
national 1 35 14
security 1 35 14
and 1 35 14
interests 1 35 14
to 0 35 14
whether 0 35 14
or 0 35 14
not 0 35 14
and 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
what 0 35 14
manner 0 35 14
it 0 35 14
is 0 35 14
breaching 0 35 14
the 0 35 14
nuclear 0 35 14

accord. 0 35 15
This 0 35 15
was 0 35 15
a 0 35 15
critical 0 35 15
point 0 35 15
because 0 35 15
for 0 35 15
the 0 35 15
past 0 35 15
two 0 35 15
years, 0 35 15
US 0 35 15
discourse 0 35 15
on 0 35 15
Iran 0 35 15
has 0 35 15
focused 0 35 15
solely 0 35 15
on 0 35 15
whether 0 35 15
or 0 35 15
not 0 35 15
Iran 0 35 15
was 0 35 15
complying 0 35 15
with 0 35 15
Obama’s 0 35 15
nuclear 0 35 15

pact. 0 35 16
By 0 35 16
placing 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
nuclear 0 35 16
deal 0 35 16
in 0 35 16
the 0 35 16
context 0 35 16
of 0 35 16
Iran’s 0 35 16
consistent, 0 35 16
overarching 1 35 16
hostility 1 35 16
and 1 35 16
aggression, 1 35 16
Trump 0 35 16
made 0 35 16
it 0 35 16
self-evident 0 35 16
that 0 35 16
no 0 35 16
US 0 35 16
interest 0 35 16
is 0 35 16
served 0 35 16
in 0 35 16
continuing 0 35 16
to 0 35 16
give 0 35 16
Iran 0 35 16
a 0 35 16
free 0 35 16
pass 0 35 16
from 0 35 16
congressional 0 35 16
sanctions. 0 35 16

After 0 35 17
accomplishing 0 35 17
that 0 35 17
goal, 0 35 17
Trump 0 35 17
turned 0 35 17
his 0 35 17
attention 0 35 17
to 0 35 17
how 0 35 17
Iran 0 35 17
is 0 35 17
actually 0 35 17
breaching 0 35 17
the 0 35 17
letter 0 35 17
and 0 35 17
spirit 0 35 17
of 0 35 17
the 0 35 17
nuclear 0 35 17

pact. 0 35 18
Only 0 35 18
then, 0 35 18
almost 0 35 18
as 0 35 18
an 0 35 18
afterthought, 0 35 18
did 0 35 18
he 0 35 18
announce 0 35 18
that 0 35 18
he 0 35 18
was 0 35 18
decertifying 0 35 18
Iranian 0 35 18
compliance 0 35 18
with 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
nuclear 0 35 18
deal, 0 35 18
setting 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
conditions 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
renewal 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
congressional 0 35 18
sanctions 0 35 18
on 0 35 18
Iran 0 35 18
and 0 35 18
opening 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
floodgates 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
congressional 0 35 18
sanctions 0 35 18
on 0 35 18
Iran 0 35 18
in 0 35 18
retaliation 0 35 18
for 0 35 18
the 0 35 18
full 0 35 18
spectrum 0 35 18
of 0 35 18
its 0 35 18
aggressive 1 35 18
and 1 35 18
illicit 1 35 18
acts 1 35 18
against 1 35 18
the 1 35 18
US, 1 35 18
its 1 35 18
interests 1 35 18
and 1 35 18

allies. 1 35 19
By 0 35 19
empowering 0 35 19
Congress 0 35 19
to 0 35 19
prohibit 0 35 19
economic 0 35 19
cooperation 0 35 19
with 0 35 19
Iran, 0 35 19
Trump 0 35 19
put 0 35 19
the 0 35 19
Europeans, 0 35 19
Chinese 0 35 19
and 0 35 19
Russians 0 35 19
on 0 35 19
notice 0 35 19
that 0 35 19
they 0 35 19
may 0 35 19
soon 0 35 19
face 0 35 19
a 0 35 19
choice 0 35 19
between 0 35 19
conducting 0 35 19
business 0 35 19
with 0 35 19
the 0 35 19
US 0 35 19
and 0 35 19
conducting 0 35 19
business 0 35 19

with 0 35 20
Iran. 0 35 20
After 0 35 20
putting 0 35 20
them 0 35 20
on 0 35 20
notice, 0 35 20
Trump 0 35 20
discussed 0 35 20
the 0 35 20
possibility 0 35 20
of 0 35 20
improving 0 35 20
Obama’s 0 35 20
nuclear 0 35 20

accord. 0 35 21
Among 0 35 21
other 0 35 21
things, 0 35 21
he 0 35 21
suggested 0 35 21
expanding 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
inspection 0 35 21
regime 0 35 21
against 0 35 21
Iran’s 0 35 21
nuclear 0 35 21
installations 0 35 21
and 0 35 21
canceling 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
so-called 0 35 21
“sunset” 0 35 21
clause 0 35 21
that 0 35 21
places 0 35 21
an 0 35 21
end 0 35 21
date 0 35 21
on 0 35 21
the 0 35 21
restrictions 0 35 21
governing 0 35 21
certain 0 35 21
components 0 35 21
of 0 35 21
Iran’s 0 35 21
nuclear 0 35 21

advancement. 0 35 22
Trump’s 0 35 22
address 0 35 22
has 0 35 22
the 0 35 22
potential 0 35 22
to 0 35 22
serve 0 35 22
as 0 35 22
the 0 35 22
foundation 0 35 22
of 0 35 22
a 0 35 22
major, 0 35 22
positive 0 35 22
shift 0 35 22
in 0 35 22
US 0 35 22
policy 0 35 22

toward 0 35 23
Iran. 0 35 23
Such 0 35 23
a 0 35 23
shift 0 35 23
could 0 35 23
potentially 0 35 23
facilitate 0 35 23
the 0 35 23
achievement 0 35 23
of 0 35 23
Trump’s 0 35 23
goals 0 35 23
of 0 35 23
preventing 0 35 23
Iran 0 35 23
from 0 35 23
acquiring 0 35 23
nuclear 0 35 23
weapons, 0 35 23
containing 0 35 23
its 0 35 23
regional 0 35 23
aggression 0 35 23
and 0 35 23
empowerment 0 35 23
and 0 35 23
defeating 0 35 23
its 0 35 23
terrorist 0 35 23

proxies. 0 35 24
Unfortunately, 1 35 24
it 1 35 24
is 1 35 24
also 1 35 24
likely, 1 35 24
indeed, 1 35 24
it 1 35 24
is 1 35 24
more 1 35 24
likely, 1 35 24
that 1 35 24
his 1 35 24
words 1 35 24
will 1 35 24
not 1 35 24
be 1 35 24
translated 1 35 24
into 1 35 24
policies 1 35 24
to 1 35 24
achieve 1 35 24
these 1 35 24

critical 1 35 25
aims. 1 35 25
Trump’s 0 35 25
decision 0 35 25
to 0 35 25
transfer 0 35 25
immediate 0 35 25
responsibility 0 35 25
to 0 35 25
Congress 0 35 25
for 0 35 25
holding 0 35 25
Iran 0 35 25
accountable 0 35 25
for 0 35 25
its 0 35 25
hostile 0 35 25
actions 0 35 25
on 0 35 25
the 0 35 25
military 0 35 25
and 0 35 25
other 0 35 25
fronts 0 35 25
is 0 35 25

a 0 35 26
risky 0 35 26
move. 0 35 26
He 0 35 26
has 0 35 26
a 0 35 26
lot 0 35 26
of 0 35 26
enemies, 0 35 26
and 0 35 26
the 0 35 26
nuclear 0 35 26
deal 0 35 26
has 0 35 26
a 0 35 26
lot 0 35 26
of 0 35 26
supporters 0 35 26
on 0 35 26

Capitol 0 35 27
Hill. 0 35 27
Obama 0 35 27
would 0 35 27
have 0 35 27
never 0 35 27
been 0 35 27
able 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
implement 0 35 27
his 0 35 27
nuclear 0 35 27
deal 0 35 27
if 0 35 27
Senator 0 35 27

the 0 35 27
Senate 0 35 27
Foreign 0 35 27
Affairs 0 35 27

to 0 35 27
cast 0 35 27
the 0 35 27

Obama’s 0 35 27
constitutional 0 35 27
duty 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
present 0 35 27
the 0 35 27
nuclear 0 35 27
deal 0 35 27
to 0 35 27
the 0 35 27
Senate 0 35 27
for 0 35 27
ratification 0 35 27

as 0 35 28
a 0 35 28
treaty. 0 35 28
Over 0 35 28
the 0 35 28
past 0 35 28
week, 0 35 28
Trump 0 35 28
and 0 35 28
Corker 0 35 28
have 0 35 28
been 0 35 28
involved 0 35 28
in 0 35 28
an 0 35 28
ugly 1 35 28
public 1 35 28
fight 1 35 28
precipitated 0 35 28
by 0 35 28
Corker’s 0 35 28
announcement 0 35 28
that 0 35 28
he 0 35 28
will 0 35 28
not 0 35 28
be 0 35 28
seeking 0 35 28
reelection 0 35 28

next 0 35 29
year. 0 35 29
Today 0 35 29
Corker 0 35 29
has 0 35 29
nothing 0 35 29
to 0 35 29
restrain 0 35 29
him 0 35 29
from 0 35 29
scuttling 0 35 29

Trump’s 0 35 30
agenda. 0 35 30
If 0 35 30
he 0 35 30
wishes, 0 35 30
out 0 35 30
of 0 35 30
spite, 0 35 30
Corker 0 35 30
can 0 35 30
block 0 35 30
effective 0 35 30
sanctions 0 35 30

from 0 35 31
being 0 35 31
passed. 0 35 31
And 0 35 31
he 0 35 31
may 0 35 31
do 0 35 31
so 0 35 31
even 0 35 31
though 0 35 31
the 0 35 31
implications 0 35 31
for 0 35 31
his 0 35 31
Senate 0 35 31
colleagues 0 35 31
would 0 35 31
be 0 35 31
dire 0 35 31
and 0 35 31
even 0 35 31
though 0 35 31
doing 0 35 31
so 0 35 31
would 0 35 31
render 0 35 31
him 0 35 31
an 0 35 31
unofficial 0 35 31
protector 0 35 31
of 0 35 31
Iran’s 0 35 31

nuclear 0 35 32
program. 0 35 32
What 0 35 32
is 0 35 32
true 0 35 32
for 0 35 32
Corker 0 35 32
is 0 35 32
doubly 0 35 32
true 0 35 32

for 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Democrats. 0 35 33
Leading 0 35 33
Democratic 0 35 33
senators 0 35 33
like 0 35 33
Robert 0 35 33
Menendez, 0 35 33
Ben 0 35 33
Cardin 0 35 33
and 0 35 33
Chuck 0 35 33
Schumer, 0 35 33
who 0 35 33
opposed 0 35 33
Obama’s 0 35 33
Iran 0 35 33
deal 0 35 33
may 0 35 33
now 0 35 33
feel 0 35 33
that 0 35 33
as 0 35 33
opponents 0 35 33
of 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Trump 0 35 33
administration, 0 35 33
they 0 35 33
are 0 35 33
required 0 35 33
to 0 35 33
oppose 0 35 33
any 0 35 33
change 0 35 33
to 0 35 33
the 0 35 33
Iran 0 35 33
Nuclear 0 35 33
Agreement 0 35 33

Review 0 35 34
Act. 0 35 34
Indeed, 0 35 34
given 0 35 34
the 0 35 34
rise 0 35 34
of 0 35 34
radical 0 35 34
forces 0 35 34
in 0 35 34
their 0 35 34
party 0 35 34
it 0 35 34
is 0 35 34
likely 0 35 34
that 0 35 34
they 0 35 34
would 0 35 34
rather 0 35 34
give 0 35 34
Iran 0 35 34
a 0 35 34
free 0 35 34
pass 0 35 34
for 0 35 34
its 0 35 34
anti-American 0 35 34
aggression 0 35 34
and 0 35 34
nuclear 0 35 34
proliferation 0 35 34
than 0 35 34
work 0 35 34
with 0 35 34
Republicans 0 35 34
on 0 35 34
Capitol 0 35 34
Hill 0 35 34
and 0 35 34

in 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
White 0 35 35
House. 0 35 35
Then 0 35 35
again, 0 35 35
by 0 35 35
framing 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
issue 0 35 35
of 0 35 35
Iran’s 0 35 35
threat 0 35 35
to 0 35 35
America 0 35 35
as 0 35 35
he 0 35 35
did, 0 35 35
and 0 35 35
by 0 35 35
transferring 0 35 35
responsibility 0 35 35
for 0 35 35
reinstating 0 35 35
sanctions 0 35 35
and 0 35 35
passing 0 35 35
further 0 35 35
sanctions 0 35 35
on 0 35 35
Iran 0 35 35
to 0 35 35
Congress, 0 35 35
Trump 0 35 35
opened 0 35 35
up 0 35 35
the 0 35 35
possibility 0 35 35
that 0 35 35
Congress 0 35 35
will 0 35 35
conduct 0 35 35
substantive 0 35 35
– 0 35 35
rather 0 35 35
than 0 35 35
personal 0 35 35

– 0 35 36
debates 0 35 36
on 0 35 36
Iran. 0 35 36
And 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
more 0 35 36
substantive 0 35 36
those 0 35 36
debates 0 35 36
become, 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
further 0 35 36
away 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
US 0 35 36
discourse 0 35 36
will 0 35 36
move 0 35 36
from 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
mendacious 0 35 36
assumptions 0 35 36
of 0 35 36
Obama’s 0 35 36
Iran 0 35 36
policy 0 35 36
– 0 35 36
that 0 35 36
the 0 35 36
Iranian 0 35 36
regime 0 35 36
is 0 35 36
a 0 35 36
responsible 0 35 36
actor 0 35 36
and 0 35 36
potential 0 35 36
US 0 35 36
ally, 0 35 36
and 0 35 36
that 0 35 36
there 0 35 36
is 0 35 36
nothing 0 35 36
inherently 0 35 36
aggressive 0 35 36
or 0 35 36
problematic 0 35 36
about 0 35 36
Iran’s 0 35 36
illicit 0 35 36
nuclear 0 35 36

weapons 0 35 37
program. 0 35 37
The 0 35 37
second 0 35 37
major 0 35 37
risk 0 35 37
inherent 0 35 37
in 0 35 37
Trump’s 0 35 37
approach 0 35 37
is 0 35 37
that 0 35 37
he 0 35 37
will 0 35 37
get 0 35 37
his 0 35 37
way; 0 35 37
that 0 35 37
the 0 35 37
Europeans, 0 35 37
Russians 0 35 37
and 0 35 37
Chinese 0 35 37
and 0 35 37
the 0 35 37
Iranians 0 35 37
will 0 35 37
agree 0 35 37
to 0 35 37
improve 0 35 37

the 0 35 38
nuclear 0 35 38
deal. 0 35 38
The 0 35 38
problem 0 35 38

here 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
not 0 35 39
obvious. 0 35 39
Clearly, 0 35 39
it 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
better 0 35 39
if 0 35 39
the 0 35 39
deal 0 35 39
is 0 35 39
amended 0 35 39
to 0 35 39
delete 0 35 39
the 0 35 39
sunset 0 35 39
clauses 0 35 39
and 0 35 39
expand 0 35 39

the 0 35 40
inspections 0 35 40
regime. 0 35 40
Yet 0 35 40
even 0 35 40
an 0 35 40
amended, 0 35 40
improved 0 35 40
deal 0 35 40
will 0 35 40
still 0 35 40
serve 0 35 40
as 0 35 40
a 0 35 40
shield 0 35 40
to 0 35 40

Iran’s 0 35 41
nuclear 0 35 41
program. 0 35 41
An 0 35 41
improved 0 35 41
deal 1 35 41
won’t 1 35 41
destroy 1 35 41

Iran’s 0 35 42
centrifuges. 0 35 42
It 1 35 42
won’t 1 35 42
take 0 35 42
away 0 35 42

Iran’s 0 35 43
enriched 0 35 43
uranium. 0 35 43
It 1 35 43
won’t 1 35 43
destroy 1 35 43
Iran’s 0 35 43

nuclear 0 35 44
installations. 0 35 44
And 0 35 44
it 1 35 44
won’t 1 35 44
bring 1 35 44
down 0 35 44
the 0 35 44
regime 0 35 44
which 0 35 44
by 0 35 44
its 0 35 44
nature 0 35 44
ensures 0 35 44
all 0 35 44
of 0 35 44
these 0 35 44
things 0 35 44
will 0 35 44
remain 0 35 44
a 1 35 44
menace 1 35 44
to 1 35 44
the 1 35 44
US, 1 35 44
its 1 35 44
allies 1 35 44
and 1 35 44
international 1 35 44

security 1 35 45
as 1 35 45
a 1 35 45
whole. 1 35 45
So 0 35 45
long 0 35 45
as 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
US 0 35 45
continues 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
maintain 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
policy 0 35 45
based 0 35 45
on 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
false 0 35 45
view 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
all 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
is 0 35 45
necessary 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
destroy 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
threat 0 35 45
of 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
armed 0 35 45
Iran 0 35 45
is 0 35 45
a 0 35 45
combination 0 35 45
of 0 35 45
the 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
deal 0 35 45
and 0 35 45
economic 0 35 45
sanctions, 0 35 45
it 0 35 45
will 0 35 45
continue 0 35 45
to 0 35 45
ensure 0 35 45
that 0 35 45
Iran 0 35 45
and 0 35 45
its 0 35 45
nuclear 0 35 45
program 0 35 45

remain 0 35 46
a 0 35 46
major 0 35 46
threat. 0 35 46
Distressingly, 0 35 46
US 0 35 46
Ambassador 0 35 46
to 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
UN 0 35 46
Nikki 0 35 46
Haley, 0 35 46
the 1 35 46
most 1 35 46
outspoken 1 35 46
supporter 1 35 46
of 0 35 46
decertifying 0 35 46
Iranian 0 35 46
compliance 0 35 46
in 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
Trump 0 35 46
administration, 0 35 46
told 0 35 46
NBC 0 35 46
on 0 35 46
Sunday 0 35 46
that 0 35 46
the 0 35 46
US 0 35 46
intends 0 35 46
to 0 35 46

remain 0 35 47
in 0 35 47
the 0 35 47
nuclear 0 35 47
deal. 0 35 47
To 0 35 47
understand 0 35 47
what 0 35 47
must 0 35 47
be 0 35 47
done 0 35 47
we 0 35 47
must 0 35 47
return 0 35 47
to 0 35 47
Trump’s 0 35 47
speech 0 35 47
and 0 35 47

its 0 35 48
strategic 0 35 48
significance. 0 35 48
By 0 35 48
taking 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
holistic 0 35 48
view 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
Iranian 0 35 48
threat 0 35 48
– 0 35 48
grounded 0 35 48
in 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
recognition 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
inherent 0 35 48
hostility 0 35 48
of 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
regime 0 35 48
– 0 35 48
Trump 0 35 48
opened 0 35 48
up 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
possibility 0 35 48
that 0 35 48
the 0 35 48
US 0 35 48
and 0 35 48
its 0 35 48
allies 0 35 48
can 0 35 48
develop 0 35 48
a 0 35 48
holistic 0 35 48
policy 0 35 48
for 0 35 48
confronting 0 35 48
and 0 35 48
defeating 0 35 48

Iran 0 35 49
and 0 35 49
its 0 35 49
proxies. 0 35 49
If 0 35 49
the 0 35 49
Iran 0 35 49
deal 0 35 49
and 0 35 49
sanctions 0 35 49
are 0 35 49
two 0 35 49
components 0 35 49
to 0 35 49
a 0 35 49
larger 0 35 49
strategy 0 35 49
rather 0 35 49
than 0 35 49
the 0 35 49
entire 0 35 49
strategy, 0 35 49

they 0 35 50
can 0 35 50
be 0 35 50
helpful. 0 35 50
A 0 35 50
wider 0 35 50
strategy 0 35 50
would 0 35 50
target 0 35 50
Iran’s 0 35 50
regional 0 35 50
aggression 0 35 50
by 0 35 50
weakening 0 35 50
its 0 35 50
proxies 0 35 50
and 0 35 50
clients 0 35 50
from 0 35 50
Hezbollah 0 35 50
and 0 35 50
Hamas 0 35 50
to 0 35 50
the 0 35 50
regimes 0 35 50
in 0 35 50
Iraq, 0 35 50

Yemen, 0 35 51
Syria 0 35 51
and 0 35 51
Lebanon. 0 35 51
It 0 35 51
would 0 35 51
target 0 35 51
the 0 35 51
regime 0 35 51
itself 0 35 51
by 0 35 51
empowering 0 35 51
the 0 35 51
ayatollahs’ 0 35 51

domestic 0 35 52
opponents. 0 35 52
It 0 35 52
would 0 35 52
pin 0 35 52
down 0 35 52
Iranian 0 35 52
forces 0 35 52
by 0 35 52
arming 0 35 52
and 0 35 52
otherwise 0 35 52
assisting 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
Iraqi 0 35 52
Kurds 0 35 52
to 0 35 52
defend 0 35 52
and 0 35 52
maintain 0 35 52
their 0 35 52
control 0 35 52
over 0 35 52
their 0 35 52
territory 0 35 52
along 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
Iranian 0 35 52
border 0 35 52
while 0 35 52
strengthening 0 35 52
the 0 35 52
ties 0 35 52
between 0 35 52

Iranian 0 35 53
Kurds 0 35 53
and 0 35 53
Iraqi 0 35 53
Kurds. 0 35 53
Friday, 0 35 53
Trump 0 35 53
created 0 35 53
the 0 35 53
possibility 0 35 53

for 0 35 54
such 0 35 54
a 0 35 54
strategy. 0 35 54
It 0 35 54
is 0 35 54
up 0 35 54
to 0 35 54
members 0 35 54
of 0 35 54
Congress, 0 35 54
and 0 35 54
US 0 35 54
allies 0 35 54
like 0 35 54
Israel 0 35 54
and 0 35 54
the 0 35 54
Sunni 0 35 54
Arab 0 35 54
states 0 35 54
to 0 35 54
help 0 35 54
Trump 0 35 54

conceive 0 35 54

and 0 35 54

implement 0 35 54

it. 0 35 54

If 1 35 54

they 1 35 54

fail, 1 35 54

the 1 35 54

possibility 1 35 54

Trump 1 35 54

created 1 35 54

will 1 35 54

be 1 35 54

lost, 1 35 54

perhaps 1 35 54

irrevocably. 1 35 54
