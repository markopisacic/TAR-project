that 0
an 0

that 0
was 0
involved 0

The 0
Hill's 0
John 0
Solomon 0
reported 0
on 0
Wednesday: 0

The 0
informant, 0
Douglas 0
Campbell, 0
said 0
in 0
the 0
statement 0
obtained 0
by 0
The 0
Hill 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
told 0
by 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
executives 0
that 0
Moscow 0
had 0
hired 0
the 0
American 0
lobbying 0
firm 0
APCO 0
Worldwide 0
specifically 0
because 0
it 0
was 0
in 0
position 0
to 0
influence 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration, 0
and 0
more 0
specifically 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

... 0
Campbell 0
added 0
in 0
the 0
testimony 0
that 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
officials 0
“told 0
me 0
at 0
various 0
times 0
that 0
they 0
expected 0
APCO 0
to 0
apply 0
a 0
portion 0
of 0
the 0
$3 0
million 0
annual 0
lobbying 0
fee 0
it 0
was 0
receiving 0
from 0
the 0
Russians 0
to 0
provide 0
in-kind 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
Clintons' 0
Global 0
Initiative." 0

“The 0

called 0
for 0
four 0
payments 0
of 0
$750,000 0
over 0
twelve 0
months. 0

was 0
expected 0
to 0
give 0
assistance 0
free 0
of 0
charge 0
to 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative 0
as 0
part 0
of 0
their 0
effort 0
to 0
create 0
a 0
favorable 0
environment 0
to 0
ensure 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
made 0
affirmative 0
decisions 0
on 0
everything 0
from 0
Uranium 0
One 0
to 0
the 0
U.S.-Russia 0
Civilian 0
Nuclear 0
Cooperation 0
agreement." 0

APCO 0
officials 0
told 0
The 0
Hill 0
that 0
its 0
support 0
for 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative 0
and 0
its 0
work 0
with 0
Russia 0
were 0
not 0
connected 0
in 0
any 0
way, 0
and 0
in 0
fact 0
involved 0
different 0
divisions 0
of 0
the 0
firm. 0

They 0
added 0
their 0
lobbying 0
for 0
Russia 0
did 0
not 0
involve 0
Uranium 0
One 0
but 0
rather 0
focused 0
on 0
regulatory 0
issues 0
aimed 0
at 0
helping 0
Russia 0
better 0
compete 0
for 0
nuclear 0
fuel 0
contracts 0
inside 0
the 0
United 0
States. 0

In 0
case 0
you 0
are 0
unfamiliar 0
with 0
Uranium 0
One, 0
it 0
is 0
a 0
Canadian 0
mining 0
company 0
whose 0
sale 0
to 0
a 0
Russian 0
firm 0
was 0
approved 0
in 0
2010. 0

The 0
sale 0
gave 0
the 0
Russians 0
control 0
of 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
US 0
uranium 0
supply, 0
thus 0
why 0
I 0
reference 0
a 0
case 0
could 0
be 0
made 0
for 0
treason. 0

While 0
Democrats 0
have 0
unsurprisingly 0
questioned 0
Campbell's 0
credibility, 0
Campbell's 0
attorney 0
Victoria 0
Toensing 0
told 0
Sean 0
Hannity, 0
“[The 0
Russians] 0
were 0
so 0
confident 0
that 0
they 0
told 0
Mr. 0
Campbell 0
with 0
the 0
Clinton’s 0
help, 0
it 0
was 0
a 0
shoo-in 0
to 0
get 0
CFIUS 0
[The 0
Committee 0
on 0
Foreign 0
Investment 0
in 0

United 0

approval. 0

They 0
were 0
so 0
confident 0
in 0
that 0
that 0
they 0
even 0
had 0
him 0
open 0
up 0
the 0
new 0

because 0
they 0

were 0

In 0
a 0
lengthy 0
report 0
by 0
Award-winning 0
National 0
Security/War 0
Correspondent 0
Sara 0
Carter, 0
she 0
pointed 0
out 0
that 0
following: 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
he 0
shared 0
with 0
the 0
committee 0
information 0
he 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
has 0
in 0
the 0
past 0
described 0
his 0
frustration 0
with 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration’s 0
failure 0
to 0
stop 0
Russia’s 0
nuclear 0
giant 0
from 0
purchasing 0
20 0
percent 0
of 0
American 0
uranium 0
mining 0
assets. 0

Campbell 0
testified 0
before 0
numerous 0
Congressional 0
investigators 0
that 0
his 0
extensive 0
counterintelligence 0
work 0
on 0
Russia 0
and 0
stated 0
that 0
during 0
his 0
time 0
as 0
an 0
informant, 0
he 0
obtained 0
information 0
that 0
Russia 0
was 0
continuing 0
to 0
aid 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government. 0

According 0
to 0
Campbell 0
Russia 0
provided 0
the 0
resources 0
necessary 0
for 0
the 0
nation’s 0
nuclear 0
reactors, 0
despite 0
promises 0
that 0
they 0
were 0
not 0
sharing 0
such 0
technology 0
with 0
Iran. 0

In 0
an 0
April 0
16, 0
2010, 0
summary 0
brief 0
provided 0
to 0
his 0
former 0
FBI 0
handlers 0
and 0
obtained 0
by 0
this 0
reporter, 0
he 0
stressed 0
his 0
deep 0
concerns 0
about 0
Tenex, 0
a 0
wholly 0
owned 0
subsidiary 0
of 0
the 0
Russian 0
state 0
nuclear 0
arm 0
Rosatom 0
and 0
its 0
ongoing 0
work 0
to 0
provide 0
Iran 0
with 0
the 0
technology 0
needed 0
for 0
its 0
nuclear 0
reactor 0
program. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Rosatom 0
was 0
seeking 0
the 0
approval 0
to 0
purchase 0
the 0
Canadian 0
mining 0
company 0
Uranium 0
One. 0

“TENEX 0
continues 0
to 0
supply 0
Iran 0
with 0
fuel 0
through 0
their 0
Russian 0
company 0
TVEL,” 0
stated 0
Campbell 0
in 0
a 0
2010 0
brief 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
FBI. 0

TVEL 0
is 0
a 0
Russian 0
nuclear 0
fuel 0
cycle 0
company 0
headquartered 0
in 0
Moscow. 0

“They 0
(TVEL) 0
continue 0
to 0
assist 0
with 0
construction 0
consult 0
and 0
fabricated 0
assemblies 0
to 0
supply 0
the 0
reactor. 0

Fabricated 0
assemblies 0
require 0
sophisticated 0
engineering 0
and 0
are 0
arranged 0
inside 0
the 0
reactor 0
with 0
the 0
help 0
and 0
consult 0
of 0
TVEL.” 0
Campbell 0
informed 0
the 0
FBI 0
of 0
the 0
close 0
relationship 0
between 0
TVEL 0
and 0
TENEX, 0
both 0
a 0
part 0
of 0
the 0
Rosatom 0
group. 0

He 0
stated 0
in 0
his 0
brief 0
that 0
while 0
spending 0
time 0
with 0
the 0
Russian 0
executives 0
from 0
both 0
Rosatom 0
and 0
Tenex, 0
that 0
any 0
mention 0
of 0
“TVEL 0
is 0
a 0
subject 0
that 0
is 0
serious 0
to 0
all 0
when 0
mentioned. 0

I 0
do 0
not 0
even 0
raise 0
the 0
subject 0
of 0
TVEL 0
to 0
our 0
friends, 0
but 0
occasionally 0
they 0
speak 0
of 0
it 0
and 0
always 0
in 0
a 0
guarded 0
manner.” 0
In 0
the 0
briefs, 0
he 0
informed 0
the 0
FBI 0
that 0
“occasionally 0
someone 0
will 0
mention 0
having 0
been 0
in 0
Iran 0
but 0
usually 0
it 0
is 0
long 0
after 0
the 0
fact.” 0
And 0
when 0
he 0
asked 0
the 0
Russians 0
about 0
these 0
connections, 0
he 0
stated 0
that 0
they 0
“occasionally 0
speak 0
of 0
the 0
relationship, 0
i.e. 0

equipment, 0
consulting. 0

I 0
asked 0
Vadim 0
(Mikerin) 0
if 0
they 0
felt 0
there 0
was 0
a 0
serious 0
problem, 0
and 0
would 0
they 0
adhere 0
to 0
sanctions 0
and 0
western 0
opinion. 0

His 0
response 0
was 0
a 0
smile 0
and 0
shoulder 0
shrug.” 0
But 0
Campbell 0
had 0
provided 0
the 0
FBI 0
with 0
evidence 0
of 0
the 0
criminal 0
network 0
and 0
delivered 0
the 0
information 0
to 0
the 0
FBI, 0
which 0
was 0
monitoring 0
his 0
work 0
as 0
an 0
informant 0
and 0
approving 0
his 0
transfer 0
of 0
bribery 0
money 0
to 0
the 0
Russians. 0

Those 0
transfers, 0
which 0
were 0
made 0
in 0
bulk 0
$50,000 0
sums 0
and 0
at 0
times 0
delivered 0
in 0
cash, 0
occurred 0
between 0
senior 0
executives 0
of 0
the 0
American 0
transportation 0
company 0
and 0
the 0
Russian 0
executives 0
connected 0
to 0
Rosatom. 0

He 0
had 0
given 0
the 0
FBI 0
irrefutable 0
evidence 0
showing 0
how 0
contracts 0
obtained 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
Russian 0
energy 0
company 0
Tenex, 0
were 0
based 0
on 0
contract 0
bribery 0
and 0
other 0
nefarious 0
actions, 0
he 0
said. 0

Senior 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
FBI, 0
Department 0
of 0
Treasury, 0
Department 0
of 0
Energy 0
and 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
were 0
also 0
briefed 0
on 0
Campbell’s 0
information 0
and 0
were 0
apprised 0
of 0
the 0
various 0
facets 0
pertaining 0
to 0
Russia’s 0
acquisition 0
of 0
the 0
Canadian 0
company. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Campbell 0
had 0
been 0
told 0
by 0
his 0
FBI 0
handlers 0
that 0
his 0
work 0
had 0
made 0
it 0
at 0
least 0
twice 0
into 0
President 0
Obama’s 0
classified 0
presidential 0
daily 0
briefings. 0

Of 1
course, 1
we 1
know 1
what 1
Obama 1
did 1
with 1
his 1
daily 1
briefings. 1

They 1
are 1
somewhere 1
in 1
the 1
White 1
House 1
sewer 1
system. 1

Campbell's 0
work 0
has 0
resulted 0
in 0
real 0
justice 0
being 0
administered. 0

In 0
January, 0
I 0
reported: 0

On 0
Friday, 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
unsealed 0
an 0
11-count 0
indictment 0
concerning 0
the 0
Uranium 0
One 0
scandal. 0

Sadly, 0
it 0
did 0
not 0
include 0
former 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Hillary 0
Clinton, 0
but 0
rather 0
former 0
DoD 0
intelligence 0
analyst-turned 0
uranium 0
transportation 0
executive 0
Mark 0
Lambert 0
of 0
Mount 0
Airy, 0
Maryland. 0

Lambert, 0
54, 0
was 0
charged 0
with 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
violate 0
the 0
Foreign 0
Corrupt 0
Practices 0
Act 0
(FCPA) 0
and 0
to 0
commit 0
wire 0
fraud, 0
seven 0
counts 0
of 0
violating 0
the 0
FCPA, 0
two 0
counts 0
of 0
wire 0
fraud 0
and 0
one 0
count 0
of 0
international 0
promotion 0
money 0
laundering. 0

The 0
charges 0
stem 0
from 0
an 0
alleged 0
scheme 0
to 0
bribe 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin, 0
a 0
Russian 0
official 0
at 0
JSC 0
Techsnabexport 0
(TENEX), 0
a 0
subsidiary 0
of 0
Russia’s 0
State 0

Federation 0
uranium 0
and 0
uranium 0
enrichment 0
services 0
to 0
nuclear 0
power 0
companies 0
worldwide, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
contracts 0
with 0
TENEX. 0

According 0
to 0
the 0
DOJ: 0
According 0
to 0
the 0
indictment, 0
beginning 0
at 0
least 0
as 0
early 0
as 0
2009 0
and 0
continuing 0
until 0
October 0
2014, 0
Lambert 0
conspired 0
with 0
others 0
at 0
“Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A” 0
to 0
make 0
corrupt 0
and 0
fraudulent 0
bribery 0
and 0
kickback 0
payments 0
to 0
offshore 0
bank 0
accounts 0
associated 0
with 0

companies, 0
at 0
the 0
direction 0
of, 0
and 0
for 0
the 0
benefit 0
of, 0
a 0
Russian 0
official, 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin, 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
secure 0
improper 0
business 0
advantages 0
and 0
obtain 0
and 0
retain 0
business 0
with 0
TENEX. 0

In 0
order 0
to 0
effectuate 0
and 0
conceal 0
the 0
corrupt 0
and 0
fraudulent 0
bribe 0
payments, 0
Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
allegedly 0
caused 0
fake 0
invoices 0
to 0
be 0
prepared, 0
purportedly 1
from 0
TENEX 0
to 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A, 0
that 0
described 0
services 0
that 0
were 0
never 0
provided, 0
and 0
then 0
Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
caused 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A 0
to 0
wire 0
the 0
corrupt 0
payments 0
for 0
those 0
purported 0
services 0
to 0
shell 0
companies 0
in 0
Latvia, 0
Cyprus 0
and 0
Switzerland. 0

Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
also 0
allegedly 0
used 0
code 0
words 0
like 0
“lucky 0
figures,” 0
“LF,” 0
“lucky 0
numbers,” 0
and 0
“cake” 0
to 0
describe 0
the 0
payments 0
in 0
emails 0
to 0
the 0
Russian 0
official 0
at 0
his 0
personal 0
email 0
account. 0

The 0
indictment 0
also 0
alleges 0
that 0
Lambert 0
and 0
others 0
caused 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A 0
to 0
overbill 0
TENEX 0
by 0
building 0
the 0
cost 0
of 0
the 0
corrupt 0
payments 0
into 0
their 0
invoices, 0
and 0
TENEX 0
thus 0
overpaid 0
for 0
Transportation 0
Corporation 0
A’s 0
services. 0

In 0
June 0
2015, 0
Lambert’s 0
former 0
co-president, 0
Daren 0
Condrey, 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
violate 0
the 0
FCPA 0
and 0
commit 0
wire 0
fraud, 0
and 0
Vadim 0
Mikerin 0
pleaded 0
guilty 0
to 0
conspiracy 0
to 0
commit 0
money 0

involving 0
violations 0
of 0

Mikerin 0
is 0
currently 0

a 0
sentence 0
of 0
48 0
months 0
in 0
prison 0
and 0
Condrey 0
is 0
awaiting 0

The 0
indictment 0
includes 0
allegations 0
against 0
Lambert 0
based 0
on 0
his 0
role 0
in 0
effectuating 0
the 0
criminal 0
scheme 0
with 0
Condrey, 0
Mikerin, 0

We 0
also 0

about 0
Campbell: 0

Undercover 0
FBI 0
informant 0
William 0
Campbell 0
has 0
given 0

to 0
Congressional 0
investigators 0
after 0
an 0
"iron 0

was 0

in 0

Campbell 0
was 0
