A 0
professor 0
at 0
Southern 0
New 0
Hampshire 0
University 0
failed 0
one 0
of 0
her 0
student's 0
assignments 0
because 0
the 1
professor 1
incorrectly 1
thought 1
Australia 1
"is 1
not 1
a 1
country," 1
according 0
to 0
a 0
report 0
in 0
BuzzFeed 0
News. 0

Australia 0
is, 0
in 0
fact, 0
a 0
country. 0

The 0
student, 0
Ashley 0
Arnold, 0
is 0
working 0
towards 0
an 0
online 0
sociology 0
degree 0
with 0
the 0
university. 0

For 0
one 0
of 0
her 0
final 0
assignments, 0
she 0
had 0
to 0
compare 0
a 0
social 0
norm 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
to 0
another 0
country. 0

She 0
chose 0
to 0
compare 0
social 0
media 0
use 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
to 0
what 0
it's 0
like 0
in 0
Australia. 0

The 0
professor, 0
according 0
to 0
BuzzFeed 0
News, 0
failed 0
Arnolds 0
because 0
"Australia 0
is 0
a 0
continent; 1
not 1
a 1
country," 1
which, 0
again, 0
is 0
incorrect, 0
just 1
so 1
we're 1
clear 1
here. 1

Australia 0
is 0
both 0
a 0
continent 0
and 0
a 0
country. 0

When 0
Arnold 0
complained, 0
the 0
professor 0
said 0
they'd 0
reexamine 0
the 0
assignment, 0
but 0
did 0
not 0
concede 0
that 0
Australia 0
was 0
a 0
country. 0

"Australia 1
is 1
a 1
continent; 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
a 1
country. 1

That 0
error 0
made 0
it 0
nearly 0
impossible 0
for 0
you 0
to 0
accurately 0
complete 0
your 0
week 0
2 0
research 0
outline 0
correctly," 0
the 0
professor 0
wrote 0
in 0
an 0
email 0
obtained 0
by 0
BuzzFeed 0
News. 0

"As 0
I 0
mentioned 0
above 0
I 0
will 0
look 0
over 0
your 0
week 0
two 0
paper 0
once 0
again 0
and 0
see 0
if 0
you 0
earned 0
more 0
credits 0
than 0
I 0
gave 0
you." 0

In 0
another 0
email 0
exchange, 0
Arnold 0
correctly 0
asserted 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
a 0
country, 0
linking 0
to 0
the 0
"About 0
Australia" 0
section 0
of 0
the 0
country's 0
website: 0

Australia 1
is 1
both 1
a 1
country 1
and 1
a 1
continent. 1

It's 1
the 1
only 1
country 1
that 1
is 1
both. 1

I 1
provided 1
a 1
resource 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
email 1
that 1
clarifies 1
that 1
for 1
you. 1

If 1
you 1
need 1
further 1
clarification 1
google 1
or 1
the 1
SNHU 1
Shapiro 1
Library 1
has 1
that 1
information 1
you. 1

Again 0
I 0
mean 0
no 0
disrespect 0
but 0
my 0
grade 0
is 0
affected 0
by 0
your 0
assumption 0
that 0
Australia 0
is 0
not 0
a 0
country 0
when 0
it 0
in 0
fact 0
is. 0

Thank 0
you 0
and 0
let 0
me 0
know 0
if 0
I 0
need 0
to 0
provide 0
further 0
resources 0
proving 0
Australia 0
is 0
a 0
country. 0

The 0
professor 0
said 0
they'd 0
take 0
Arnold's 0
concerns 0
into 0
consideration. 0

"Thank 0
you 0
for 0
this 0
web-address," 0
they 0
wrote. 0

"After 0
I 0
do 0
some 0
independent 0
research 0
on 0
the 0
continent/country 0
issue 0
I 0
will 0
review 0
your 0
paper." 0

After 0
a 0
period 0
of 0
review, 0
the 0
professor 0
changed 0
Arnold's 0
grade 0
to 0
a 0
B+, 0
