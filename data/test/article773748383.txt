the 0
Second 0
Amendment 0
Foundation 0
(SAF) 0

DD 0
sued 0
the 0
State 0

arguing 0
that 0
"sharing 0
instructions 0
on 0
how 0
to 0
make 0
guns 0
with 0
3D 0
printers 0
counts 0
as 0
constitutionally 0
protected 0
speech. 0

This 0
is 0
an 0
important 0
victory 0
for 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights." 0

The 0
Justice 0
Department’s 0
recent 0
settlement 0
with 0
Wilson 0
is 0
very 0
favorable 0
to 0
him, 0
allowing 0
Wilson 0
to 0
provide 0
the 0
printing 0
instructions 0
“for 0
public 0
release 0
(meaning 0
unlimited 0
distribution) 0
in 0
any 0
form.” 0
The 0
government 0
also 0
compensated 0
$40,000 0
of 0
Wilson’s 0
legal 0
costs. 0

While 0
this 0
settlement 0
is 0
a 0
victory 0
for 0
First 0
Amendment 0
rights, 0
it 1
will 1
be 1
difficult, 1
if 1
not 1
impossible, 1
for 0
the 0
government 0
to 0
regulate 0
either 0
the 0
printers 0
or 0
the 0
guns 0
that 0
are 0
made 0
with 0
them. 0

How 0
the 0
government 0
will 0
stop 0
people 0
from 0
obtaining 0
these 0
printers 0
isn’t 0
exactly 0
obvious. 0

Proposals 0
to 0
require 0
background 0
checks, 0
mandatory 0
serial 0
numbers 0
and 0
even 0
a 0
registration 0
process 0
for 0
printers 0
are 0
easily 0
defeated. 0

Even 0
if 0
printers 0
are 0
registered 0
with 0
the 0
government, 0
what 0
is 0
going 0
to 0
stop 0
gangs 0
from 0
stealing 0
them? 0

And 0
the 0
designs 0
for 0
making 0
your 0
own 0
printer 0
have 0
been 0
available 0
on 0
the 0
Internet 0
for 0
years. 0

3D 0
printers 0
make 1
the 1
already 1
extremely 1
difficult 1
job 1
of 1
controlling 1
access 1
to 1
guns 1
practically 1
impossible. 1

The 0
government 0
is 0
not 0
going 0
to 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
ban 0
guns, 0
and 0
limits 0
on 0
the 0
size 0
of 0
bullet 0
magazines 0
will 0
be 0
even 1
more 1
laughable 1
than 0
before. 0

Many 0
parts 0
of 0
a 0
gun 0
can 0
be 0
made 0
on 0
very 0
inexpensive, 0
plastic 0
3D 0
printers 0
or 0
even 0
from 0
simple 0
machine 0
tools. 0

It 0
will 0
be 0
even 0
more 0
difficult 0
to 0
impose 0
background 0
checks, 0
which 1
have 1
proven 1
quite 1
useless 1
anyway. 1

The 1
government 1
has 1
been 1
no 1
more 1
effective 1
at 1
stopping 1
criminals 1
from 1
getting 1
guns 1
than 1
at 1
stopping 1
them 1
from 1
obtaining 1
drugs. 1

That 0
isn’t 0
too 0
surprising, 0
as 0
drug 0
gangs 0
are 0
the 0
source 0
of 0
both 0
illegal 0
drugs 0
and 0
guns. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
tough 0
battle 0
for 0
the 0
plaintiff's, 0
SAF 0
and 0
DD. 0

They 0
lost 0
many 0
lower 0
court 0
rulings. 0

Gun-control 0
advocates 0
believe 0
that 0
the 1
government 1
"capitulated" 1
too 0
soon. 0

J. 0
Adam 0
Skaggs, 0
the 0
chief 0
counsel 0
for 0
the 0
Giffords 0
Law 0
Center 0
to 0
Prevent 0
Gun 0
Violence, 0
said 0
the 1
administration 1
“capitulated 1
in 0
a 0
case 0
it 0
had 0
won 0
at 0
every 0
step 0
of 0
the 0
way. 0

This 1
isn’t 1
a 1
case 1
where 1
the 1
underlying 1
facts 1
of 1
the 1
law 1
changed. 1

The 1
only 1
thing 1
that 1
changed 1
was 1
the 1
administration.” 1

The 0
concept 0
of 0
making 0
guns 0
with 0
3D 0
printers 0
in 0
an 0
age 0
where 0
just 0
one 0
year 0
can 0
render 0
much 0
technology 0
obsolete 0
shouldn't 0
surprise 0
anyone. 0

Nor 0
should 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
instructions 0
for 0
gun 0
assembly 0
are 0
easily 0
available 0
for 0
download 0
over 0
the 0
internet. 0

At 0
the 0
click 0
of 0
a 0
mouse, 0
we 0
can 0
summon 0
almost 0
any 0
information 0
we 0
could 0
possibly 0
need 0
including 0
instructions 0
for 0
making 0
a 0
bomb. 0

The 0
ability 0
to 0
build 0
an 0
untraceable, 0
unregistered 0
gun 0
is 0
definitely 0
a 1
game 1
changer. 1

It's 0
difficult 0
to 0
see 0
how 0
"ghost 1
guns" 1
could 0
ever 0
be 0
regulated 0
by 0
the 0
government. 0
