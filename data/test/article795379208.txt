WASHINGTON 0
— 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Michael 0
R. 0
Pompeo 0
expressed 0
confidence 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
the 0
Saudi 0
government 0
could 0
be 0
trusted 0
to 0
investigate 0
the 0
disappearance 0
and 0
suspected 0
murder 0
of 0
a 0
U.S.-based 0
Saudi 0
journalist 0
in 0
a 0
Saudi 0
diplomatic 0
facility 0
in 0
Turkey 0
— 0
despite 0
the 0
likelihood 0
that 0
senior 0
Saudi 0
officials 0
were 0
involved. 0

Speaking 0
in 0
Ankara, 0
Turkey, 0
Pompeo 0
offered 0
that 0
support 0
hours 0
after 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
had 0
mounted 0
an 0
even 0
stronger 0
defense 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers, 0
saying, 0
“Here 0
we 0
go 0
again 0
with 0
you’re 0
guilty 0
until 0
proven 0
innocent.” 0

Together 0
they 0
appeared 0
to 0
signal 0
a 0
shift 0
in 0
White 0
House 0
strategy 0
— 0
earlier 0
this 0
week 0
Trump 0
had 0
warned 0
Saudi 0
rulers 0
could 0
face 0
“severe 1
punishment” 0
— 0
and 0
suggested 0
the 0
administration 0
has 0
decided 0
to 0
help 0
its 0
most 0
important 0
ally 0
in 0
the 0
Arab 0
world 0
defuse 0
an 0
international 0
crisis 0
over 0
the 0
fate 0
of 0
Jamal 0
Khashoggi. 0

The 0
dissident 0
journalist, 0
who 0
lived 0
in 0
Virginia, 0
vanished 0
Oct. 0
2 0
after 0
he 0
entered 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Consulate 0
in 0
Istanbul, 0
Turkey. 0

Neither 0
Trump 0
nor 0
his 0
top 0
diplomat 0
offered 0
any 0
new 0
facts 0
or 0
insights 0
in 0
the 0
case. 0

But 0
unless 0
authorities 0
recover 0
his 0
body 0
or 0
other 0
conclusive 0
evidence 0
of 0
his 0
death, 0
the 0
mystery 0
may 0
remain 0
unsolved. 0

Pompeo 0
wrapped 0
up 0
two 0
days 0
of 0
emergency 0
talks 0
in 0
the 0
region 0
— 0
first 0
with 0
Saudi 0
King 0
Salman 0
and 0
Crown 0
Prince 0
Mohammed 0
bin 0
Salman 0
in 0
Riyadh, 0
and 0
then 0
with 0
Turkish 0
President 0
Recep 0
Tayyip 0
Erdogan 0
in 0
Ankara 0
— 0
and 0
headed 0
back 0
to 0
Washington 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

Turkish 0
officials 0
have 0
described 0
— 0
but 0
have 0
not 0
released 0
— 0
what 0
they 0
say 0
are 0
audio 0
and 0
video 0
recordings 0
that 0
show 0
the 0
60-year-old 0
contributor 0
to 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
opinion 0
pages 0
was 0
interrogated, 0
tortured 1
and 1
killed 1
by 0
Saudi 0
intelligence 0
officers 0
inside 0
the 0
consulate. 0

Turkish 0
officials 0
say 0
Khashoggi’s 0
body 1
was 1
cut 1
up 1
with 1
a 1
bone 1
saw, 1
then 0
taken 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
building. 0

Turkish 0
crime 0
scene 0
investigators 0
and 0
forensic 0
specialists 0
were 0
allowed 0
to 0
search 0
for 0
evidence 0
in 0
the 0
Saudi 0
consulate 0
and 0
a 0
nearby 0
residence 0
on 0
Tuesday. 0

Erdogan 0
later 0
complained 0
that 0
the 0
interior 0
walls 0
had 0
been 0
repainted 0
in 0
recent 0
days. 0

On 0
his 0
flight 0
from 0
Riyadh 0
to 0
Ankara, 0
Pompeo 1
reiterated 1
his 1
confidence 1
that 1
the 1
Saudi 1
government 1
would 1
conduct 1
a 1
“thorough, 1
complete, 1
and 1
transparent 1
investigation,” 1
adding 1
that 1
they 1
will 1
“show 1
the 1
entire 1
world” 1
the 1
results. 1

He 0
said 0
Saudi 0
leaders 0
made 0
a 0
commitment 0
“to 0
hold 0
anyone 0
connected 0
to 0
any 0
wrongdoing 0
that 0
may 0
be 0
found 0
accountable 0
for 0
that, 0
whether 0
they 0
are 0
a 0
senior 0
officer 0
or 0
official.” 0
He 0
said 0
they 0
made 0
“no 0
exceptions,” 0
including 0
presumably 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
royal 0
family. 0

Asked 0
if 0
the 0
Saudis 0
had 0
informed 0
him 0
whether 0
Khashoggi 0
was 0
alive 0
or 0
dead, 0
Pompeo 0
said, 0
“I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
talk 0
about 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
facts. 0

They 0
didn’t 0
want 0
to 0
either, 0
in 0
that 0
they 0
want 0
to 0
have 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
complete 0
this 0
investigation 0
in 0
a 0
thorough 0
way.” 0

Asked 0
if 0
he 0
believed 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers’ 0
repeated 0
denial 0
of 0
complicity, 0
Pompeo 0
said 0
he 0
was 0
reserving 0
judgment. 0

“I 0
think 0
that’s 0
— 0
I 0
think 0
that’s 0
— 0
I 0
think 0
that’s 0
a 0
reasonable 0
thing 0
to 0
do, 0
to 0
give 0
them 0
that 0
opportunity,” 0
Pompeo 0
said, 0
“(and 0
then) 0
we’ll 0
all 0
get 0
to 0
evaluate 0
the 0
work 0
that 0
they 0
do.” 0

Pompeo 0
refused 0
to 0
discuss 0
possible 0
consequences 0
for 0
those 0
found 0
responsible 0
for 0
Khashoggi’s 0
disappearance, 0
reiterating 0
at 0
least 0
three 0
times 0
the 0
“importance 0
of 0
the 0
investigation.” 0

Later 0
Wednesday, 0
Pompeo 0
said 0
during 0
a 0
refueling 0
stopover 0
in 0
Brussels 0
that 0
Erdogan 0
had 0
informed 0
him 0
the 0
Saudis 0
were 0
cooperating 0
with 0
the 0
Turkish 0
investigation 0
“after 0
a 0
couple 0
of 0
delays.” 0

Turkish 0
officials 0
“seemed 0
pretty 0
confident 0
the 0
Saudis 0
will 0
permit 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
things 0
they 0
need 0
to 0
do 0
to 0
complete” 0
the 0
investigation, 0
Pompeo 0
told 0
reporters 0
traveling 0
with 0
him. 0

In 0
a 0
sign 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
is 0
looking 0
to 0
help 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
get 0
out 0
of 0
its 0
dilemma, 0
Pompeo 0
urged 0
Americans 0
to 0
be 0
mindful 0
of 0
the 0
extensive 0
energy, 0
economic 0
and 0
security 0
ties 0
between 0
Riyadh 0
and 0
Washington, 0
including 0
efforts 0
against 0
what 0
he 0
called 0
the 0
world’s 0
largest 0
supporter 0
of 0
terrorism, 0
Iran. 0

“The 0
Saudis 0
have 0
been 0
great 1
partners 1
in 0
working 0
alongside 0
us 0
on 0
these 0
issues,” 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

“We 0
need 0
to 0
make 0
sure 0
we 0
are 0
mindful 0
of 0
that 0
as 0
we 0
approach 0
decisions” 0
on 0
whether 0
to 0
impose 0
sanctions 0
or 0
take 0
other 0
punitive 0
steps 0
against 0
Riyadh, 0
as 0
many 0
in 0
Congress 0
and 0
elsewhere 0
have 0
urged. 0

Critics 0
questioned 0
whether 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers, 0
who 0
preside 0
over 0
an 0
authoritarian 0
regime 0
that 0
allows 0
little 0
opposition, 0
can 0
be 0
relied 0
on 0
to 0
conduct 0
a 0
credible 0
probe 0
into 0
Khashoggi’s 0
fate 0
— 0
especially 0
without 0
decisive 0
pressure 0
from 0
their 0
close 0
ally, 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration. 0

Saudi 0
leaders 0
for 0
two 0
weeks 0
denied 0
knowing 0
anything 0
about 0
the 0
Khashoggi 0
case. 0

On 0
Monday, 0
they 0
began 0
floating 0
a 0
scenario 0
— 0
initially 0
adopted 0
by 0
Trump 0
— 0
that 0
blamed 0
the 0
murder 0
inside 0
the 0
consulate 0
on 0
“rogue 0
killers,” 0
and 0
then 0
suggested 0
the 0
writer 0
was 0
accidentally 0
killed 0
during 0
an 0
interrogation 0
that 0
went 0
awry. 0

Analysts 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
desert 0
kingdom 0
said 0
it 0
was 0
likely 0
Saudi 0
leaders 0
were 0
hoping 0
the 0
scandal 0
would 0
blow 0
over 0
and 0
that 0
they 0
could 0
wait 0
it 0
out. 0

“We 0
received 0
commitments 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
complete 0
this 0
(investigation), 0
and 0
I 0
am 0
counting 0
on 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
that,” 0
Pompeo 0
said. 0

“They 0
gave 0
me 0
their 0
word.” 0
