how 0
the 0
leftwing 0
media 0
keeps 0
getting 0
so 0
riled 0
up 0
at 0
everything 0
that 0
Trump 0
does. 0

In 0
Greenwald’s 0
mind, 0
Trump 0
is 0
a 0
fairly 0
standard 1
politician 1
(when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
the 0
policies 0
he 0
supports 0
and 0
implements), 0
which 0
is 0
what 0
makes 0
the 0
media’s 0
constant 0
flow 0
of 0
outrage 0
so 0
mystifying. 0

In 0
a 0
recent 0
debate 0
over 0
the 0
Helsinki 0
Hulabaloo, 0
Greenwald 0
told 0
the 0

Now! 0

that 0
getting 0
all 0
worked 0
up 0
over 0
Trump’s 0
press 0
conference 0
with 0
Putin 0
was 0
ridiculous. 1

Why? 0

Because, 0
when 0
Trump’s 0
Russia 0
policies 0
are 0
measured 0
against 0
Obama’s… 0
it 0
becomes 0
CLEAR 0
that 0
Trump 1
has 1
obviously 1
been 1
tougher 1
against 1
Russia 1
than 1
Obama 1
ever 1
was. 1

Here’s 0
the 0
crux 0
of 0
Greenwald’s 0
argument: 0

So 0
let 0
me 0
just 0
make 0
two 0
points. 0

Number 0
one 0
is, 0
if 0
you 0
look 0
at 0
President 0
Obama 0
versus 0
President 0
Trump, 0
there’s 0
no 0
question 0
that 0
President 0
Obama 0
was 0
more 0
cooperative 0
with 0
and 0
collaborative 0
with 0
Russia 0
and 0
the 0
Russian 0
agenda 0
than 0
President 0
Trump. 0

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
sent 0
lethal 1
arms 0
to 0
Ukraine—a 0
crucial 0
issue 0
for 0
Putin—which 0
President 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
do. 0

President 0
Trump 0
has 0
bombed 0
the 0
Assad 0
forces 0
in 0
Syria, 0
a 0
client 0
state 0
of 0
Putin, 0
something 0
that 0
Obama 0
refused 0
to 0
do 0
because 0
he 0
didn’t 0
want 0
to 0
provoke 0
Putin. 0

Trump 0
has 0
expelled 0
more 1
Russian 0
diplomats 0
and 0
sanctioned 0
more 1
Russian 0
oligarchs 0
than 0
[Obama] 0
has. 0

Trump 0
undid 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal, 0
which 0
Russia 0
favored, 0
while 0
Obama 0
worked 0
with 0
Russia 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
do 0
the 0
Iran 0
deal. 0

So 0
this 0
idea 0
that 0
Trump 0
is 0
some 0
kind 0
of 0
a 0
puppet 1
of 0
Putin, 0
that 0
he 0
controls 0
him 0
with 0
blackmail, 0
is 0
the 0
kind 0
of 0
stuff 0
that 0
you 0
believe 0
if 0
you 0
read 0
too 0
many 0

Tom 0
Clancy 0
novels 0
but 0
isn’t 0
borne 0
out 0
by 0
the 0
facts. 0

The 0
other 0
issue 0
that 0
I 0
want 0
to 0
make 0
is 0
that, 0
you 0
know, 0
again, 0
this 0
idea 0
that 0
somehow 0
that 0
you 0
are 0
endorsing 0
the 0
repression 0
of 0
other 0
countries’ 0
leaders 0
if 0
you 0
meet 0
with 0
them—it 0
is 0
true 0
that 0
Trump 0
has 0
never 0
criticized 0
Putin, 0
although 0
he 0
has 0
taken 0
all 0
the 0
steps 0
I 0
just 0
outlined 0
against 0
Putin. 0

But 0
he’s 0
also 0
never 1
criticized 0
Benjamin 0
Netanyahu. 0

He’s 0
also 0
never 1
criticized 0
the 0
incredibly 1
repressive 1
leaders 0
of 0
Saudi 0
Arabia. 0

He’s 0
never 1
criticized 0
the 0
fascist 1
president 0
of 0
the 0
Philippines. 0

It 0
is 0
true 0
President 0
Trump 0
likes 0
fascist 0
and 0
authoritarian 0
leaders, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
a 0
problem, 0
but 0
it’s 0
not 0
like 0
Putin 0
is 0
the 0
only 0
leader 0
that 0
he 0
doesn’t 0
criticize. 0
