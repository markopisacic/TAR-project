First 1
they 1
came 1
for 1
the 1
Jews. 1

And 1
then 1
they 1
came 1
for 1
everyone 1
else. 1

Jewish 0
students 0
have 0
already 0
faced 0
plenty 0

at 0

The 0
latest 0
incident 0
at 0
the 0
Canadian 0
university 0
comes 0
with 0
a 0
rather 0
blatant 1
agenda. 1

A 0
Jewish 0
student 0
at 0
McGill 0
University 0
has 0
been 0
kicked 1
off 1
the 0
student 0
government 0
board 0
for 0
having 0
“conflicts 0
of 0
interest” 0
due 0
to 0
his 0
pro-Israel 0
activism. 0

Third-year 0
student 0
Noah 0
Lew 0
was 0
one 0
of 0
12 0
board 0
members 0
up 0
for 0
general 0
assembly 0
ratification 0
on 0
Monday 0
evening 0
following 0
his 0
victory 0
as 0
vice-president 0
finance 0
of 0
the 0
Arts 0
Undergraduate 0
Society. 0

The 0
ratification 0
vote 0
is 0
typically 0
a 0
mere 0
formality, 0
but 0
Monday’s 0
was 0
different 0
due 0
to 0
Democratize 0
Student 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
(SSMU), 0
an 0
organization 0
that 0
was 0
established 0
to 0
resist 0
the 0
university’s 0
ban 0
of 0
the 0
Boycott, 0
Divestment 0
and 0
Sanctions 0
(BDS) 0
movement 0
on 0
campus. 0

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
was 0
able 0
to 0
pass 0
a 0
motion 0
that 0
required 0
each 0
board 0
member 0
to 0
be 0
voted 0
upon 0
separately 0
under 0
the 0
grounds 0
that 0
they 0
weren’t 0
a 0
fan 0
of 0
the 0
names. 0

When 0
it 0
was 0
Lew’s 0
turn, 0
he 0
was 0
voted 0
down, 0
105 0
to 0
73 0
with 0
12 0
abstaining, 0
with 0
applause 0
following 0
the 0
vote. 0

Two 0
other 0
students 0
who 0
had 0
criticized 0
BDS, 0
Alexander 0
Scheffel 0
and 0
Josephine 0
Wright 0
O’Manique, 0
were 0
also 0
voted 0
down. 0

Democratize 0
SSMU 0
had 0
targeted 0
Lew 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
two 0
students 0
on 0
the 0
board 0
because 0
they 0
had 0
connections 0
to 0
the 0
Canadian 0
Jewish 0
Political 0
Affairs 0
Committee 0
(CJPAC) 0
and 0
were 0
involved 0
in 0
getting 0
the 0
BDS 0
ban 0
passed, 0
which 0
Democratize 0
SSMU 0
claimed 0
were 0
“conflicts 0
of 0
interests.” 0

Somehow 0
I 0
don't 0
think 0
being 0
a 0
member 0
of 0
a 0
Muslim 0
student 0
group 0
and 0
supporting 0
BDS 0
would 0
be 0
considered 0
a 0
conflict 0
of 0
interest. 0

But 0
the 1
campus 1
anti-Israel 1
crowd 1
has 0
been 0
working 0
rather 0
hard 0
to 0
intimidate 0
and 0
penalize 0
anyone 0
involved 0
in 0
pro-Israel 0
organizations. 0

And 0
to 0
keep 0
their 0
racist 1
boycott 1
movement 1
going 0
by 0
maintaining 0
control 0
over 0
student 0
governments. 0

Lew 0
shared 0
the 0
experience 0
on 0
Facebook. 0

“I 0
have 1
no 1
doubt 1
from 1
the 1
information 1
circulated 1
about 1
me 1
and 1
campaign 1
run 1
against 1
me 1
prior 1
to 1
this 1
vote 1
that 1
this 1
was 1
about 1
my 1
Jewish 1
identity, 1
and 1
nothing 1
more,” 1
wrote 0
Lew. 0

“I 0
was 0
blocked 0
from 0
being 0
able 0
to 0
participate 0
in 0
my 0
student 0
government 0
because 0
I 0
am 0
Jewish, 0
because 0
I 0
have 0
been 0
affiliated 0
with 0
Jewish 0
organizations, 0
and 0
because 0
I 0
believe 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
to 0
Jewish 0
self-determination.” 0
Lew 0
added 0
that 0
the 0
experience 0
shows 0
the 0
inherent 0
anti-Semitism 0
in 0
the 0
BDS 0
movement. 0

“If 0
BDS 0
is 0
not 0
anti-Semitic, 0
why 1
did 1
a 1
BDS-led 1
campaign 1
name 1
and 1
shame 1
me 1
for 1
my 1
affiliation 1
with 1
a 1
Jewish 1
organization, 1
and 1
call 1
on 1
students 1
to 1
remove 1
me 1
from 1
student 1
government 1
for 1
this 1
reason?” 1
wrote 0
Lew. 0

“If 1
BDS 1
is 1
not 1
anti-Semitic, 1
why 1
was 1
I 1
barred 1
from 1
participating 1
in 1
student 1
government 1
because 1
of 1
my 1
Jewish 1
identity?” 1

There 0
are 0
some 0
more 0
details 0
here 0
and 0
a 0
petition. 0

On 0
Monday 0
night, 0
three 0
students 0
were 0
removed 0
from 0
the 0
Board 0
of 0
Directors 0
of 0
the 0
Students’ 0
Society 0
of 0
McGill 0
University 0
(SSMU), 0
McGill’s 0
main 0
student 0
government. 0

All 0
three 0
were 0
targeted 0
for 0
removal 0
either 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
Jewish 0
or 0
have 0
vocally 0
opposed 0
anti-Jewish 0
discrimination 0
on 0
campus. 0

This 0
episode 0
is 0
utterly 1
unacceptable, 1
and 0
is 0
merely 0
the 0
latest 0
in 0
a 0
long 0
string 0
of 0
antisemitic 0
incidents 0
at 0
your 0
university. 0

Indeed, 0
according 0
to 0
eyewitnesses, 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
mob 0
that 0
removed 0
the 0
three 0
directors 0
was 0
Igor 0
Sadikov. 0

You 0
will 0
remember 0
Sadikov 0
as 0
the 0
student 0
politician 0
who 0
in 0
February 0
told 0
his 0
followers 0
to 0
“punch 1
a 1
Zionist 1
today.” 1
It 0
is 0
unclear 0
whether 0
Sadikov 0
has 0
faced 0
any 0
disciplinary 0
action 0
for 0
this 0
incitement 0
to 0
violence 0
from 0
your 0
administration. 0

Antisemitism 0
at 0
McGill 0
does 0
not 0
emerge 0
from 0
a 0
vacuum. 0

Rather, 0
it 0
has 0
been 0
nurtured 0
in 0
part 0
by 0
a 1
toxic 1
campus 1
press, 1
especially 0
the 0
McGill 0
Daily, 0
a 0
publication 0
which 0
openly 0
refuses 0
to 0
publish 0
any 0
“Zionist” 0
content. 0

In 0
practice, 0
this 0
prevents 0
McGill’s 0
Jewish 0
community 0
from 0
defending 0
itself 0
against 0
the 1
absurd 1
attacks 1
to 0
which 0
it 0
is 0
subjected. 0

If 0
the 0
Daily 0
is 0
committed 0
to 0
systematically 0
excluding 0
the 0
voices 0
of 0
an 0
ethno-religious 0
community 0
on 0
campus, 0
then 0
it 0
cannot 0
continue 0
to 0
receive 0
automatic 0
student 0
funding, 0
as 0
it 0
does 0
now. 0

The 0
double 0
standard 0
here 0
is 0
pretty 0
clear. 0

And 0
we 0
know 1
exactly 1
what 1
the 1
reaction 1
would 1
be 1
if 1
a 1
student 1
paper 1
refused 1
to 1
publish 1
any 1
pro-Islamist 1
content. 1
