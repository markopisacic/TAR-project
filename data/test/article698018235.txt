I 0 30 21
was 0 30 21
raised 0 30 21
to 0 30 21

the 1 30 23
American 1 30 23

cannot 1 30 23
accommodate 1 30 23

effectively 1 30 23
exclude 1 30 23
all 1 30 23
Jewish 1 30 23
anti-Zionists, 1 30 23
then 1 30 23
they 1 30 23
have 1 30 23
not 1 30 23
only 1 30 23
lost 1 30 23
a 1 30 23
rapidly 1 30 23

but 1 30 23
they 1 30 23
have 1 30 23
lost 1 30 23
a 1 30 23
key 1 30 23
aspect 1 30 23
of 1 30 23
their 1 30 23
Jewishness." 1 30 23

Let's 0 30 24
unpack 0 30 24
this 0 30 24
knapsack 1 30 24
of 1 30 24
entitled 1 30 24
nonsense. 1 30 24

Anti-Israel 0 30 25
activists 0 30 25
like 0 30 25
Dan 0 30 25
Fishback 0 30 25
are 0 30 25
entitled 0 30 25
to 0 30 25
exploit 0 30 25
Jewish 0 30 25
spaces 0 30 25
for 0 30 25
their 0 30 25
propoaganda... 0 30 25
even 0 30 25
while 0 30 25
they 0 30 25
advocate 0 30 25
a 0 30 25
boycott 0 30 25
of 0 30 25
the 0 30 25
Jews 0 30 25

Israel. 0 30 25

Previously 0 30 26
Dan 0 30 26
Fishback 0 30 26
had 0 30 26
authored 0 30 26
an 0 30 26
article 0 30 26
arguing 0 30 26
for 0 30 26
boycotting 0 30 26
some 0 30 26
Israeli 0 30 26
plays. 0 30 26

Now 0 30 27
he's 0 30 27
whining 1 30 27
that 0 30 27
boycotting 0 30 27
his 0 30 27
play 0 30 27
is 0 30 27
a 0 30 27
violation 0 30 27
of 0 30 27
Jewishness 0 30 27
because 0 30 27
Jews 0 30 27
are 0 30 27
a 0 30 27
"people 0 30 27
of 0 30 27
dissent 0 30 27
and 0 30 27
argument." 0 30 27

But 0 30 28
the 0 30 28
only 0 30 28
dissent 0 30 28
and 0 30 28
argument 0 30 28
that 0 30 28
Jews 0 30 28
are 0 30 28
supposed 0 30 28
to 0 30 28
welcome 0 30 28
is 0 30 28
that 0 30 28
of 0 30 28
people 1 30 28
who 1 30 28
hate 1 30 28
the 1 30 28
existence 1 30 28
of 1 30 28
Jewish 1 30 28
nationhood. 1 30 28

Not 1 30 29
of 1 30 29
Jewish 1 30 29
nationhood 1 30 29
itself. 1 30 29

"it’s 0 30 30
not 0 30 30
that 0 30 30

is 0 30 30
“censoring” 0 30 30

it’s 0 30 30
that 0 30 30

resisting 0 30 30
a 0 30 30
propaganda 0 30 30
campaign 0 30 30
that 0 30 30
was 0 30 30

influence 0 30 30

claimed 0 30 30
when 0 30 30

boycott 0 30 30

plays. 0 30 30

It's 0 30 31
not 0 30 31
that 0 30 31
boycotting 0 30 31
Dan 0 30 31
Fishback 0 30 31
censors 0 30 31
work. 0 30 31

It's 1 30 32
resistance 1 30 32
to 1 30 32
a 1 30 32
propaganda 1 30 32
campaign 1 30 32
intended 1 30 32
to 1 30 32
attack 1 30 32
the 1 30 32
human 1 30 32
rights 1 30 32
of 1 30 32
the 1 30 32
Jewish 1 30 32
people. 1 30 32

It's 0 30 33
time 0 30 33
for 0 30 33
the 0 30 33
#BDStears 0 30 33
crowd 0 30 33
to 0 30 33
examine 0 30 33
their 0 30 33
entitlement 0 30 33
and 0 30 33
recognize 0 30 33
that 0 30 33
what's 0 30 33
good 0 30 33
for 0 30 33
the 0 30 33
goose 0 30 33
is 0 30 33
good 0 30 33
for 0 30 33
the 0 30 33
gander. 0 30 33

Either 1 30 33

that 1 30 33

or 1 30 33

they 1 30 33

can 1 30 33

go 1 30 33

more 1 30 33
