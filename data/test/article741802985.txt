well 1 203 7
as 1 203 7
civilians. 1 203 7

We 0 203 8
know 0 203 8
that 0 203 8
Kazi, 0 203 8
with 0 203 8
all 0 203 8
the 0 203 8
propane 0 203 8

was 0 203 8
clearly 0 203 8
trying 0 203 8
to 0 203 8
set 0 203 8
off 0 203 8
a 0 203 8

that 0 203 8
would 0 203 8

more 0 203 8

than 0 203 8
just 0 203 8
himself. 0 203 8

Even 0 203 9
if 0 203 9

wasn’t 0 203 9
on 0 203 9
the 0 203 9

to 0 203 9
Baghdadi, 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
likelihood 0 203 9
is 0 203 9
that 0 203 9
when 0 203 9

full 0 203 9
of 0 203 9
incendiaries, 0 203 9
probably 0 203 9
this 0 203 9
has 0 203 9
something 0 203 9
to 0 203 9
do 0 203 9
with 0 203 9
the 0 203 9
global 0 203 9
jihad. 0 203 9

The 0 203 10
FBI’s 0 203 10
bafflement 0 203 10
here 0 203 10
is 0 203 10
part 0 203 10
of 0 203 10
its 0 203 10
deep, 0 203 10
deep 0 203 10
corruption. 0 203 10

The 0 203 11
FBI 0 203 11
doesn’t 0 203 11
acknowledge 0 203 11
that 0 203 11
there 0 203 11
is 0 203 11
a 0 203 11
global 0 203 11
jihad, 0 203 11
or 0 203 11
that 0 203 11
Islam 0 203 11
has 0 203 11
anything 0 203 11
to 0 203 11
do 0 203 11
with 0 203 11
terrorism. 0 203 11

It 0 203 12
doesn’t 0 203 12
admit 0 203 12
that 0 203 12
there 0 203 12
is 0 203 12
a 0 203 12
war 0 203 12
going 0 203 12
on, 0 203 12
and 0 203 12
treats 0 203 12
each 0 203 12
act 0 203 12
of 0 203 12
Islamic 0 203 12
terror 0 203 12
as 0 203 12
if 0 203 12
it 0 203 12
were 0 203 12
a 0 203 12
separate 0 203 12

discrete 0 203 12
criminal 0 203 12
event, 0 203 12
unrelated 0 203 12
to 0 203 12
all 0 203 12
the 0 203 12
others. 0 203 12

So, 0 203 13
each 0 203 13
time 0 203 13
something 0 203 13
like 0 203 13
this 0 203 13
happens, 0 203 13

It’s 0 203 14
as 0 203 14
if 0 203 14
the 0 203 14

each 0 203 14

anything 0 203 14

This 0 203 15
willful 0 203 15

leads 0 203 15
to 0 203 15
a 0 203 15
