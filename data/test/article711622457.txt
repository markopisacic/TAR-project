I’m 1
not 1
sure 1
we’re 1
doing 1
just 1
fine, 1
but 0
Trump 0
is 0
right 0
that 0
the 0
real 0
problem 0
is 0
jihad 0
terror 0
and 0
Sharia 0
supremacism, 0
and 0
British 1
authorities 1
want 1
to 1
ignore 1
that 1
and 1
shoot 1
the 1
messenger. 1

And 0
so 0
Chris 0
Bryant, 0
“a 0
senior 0

‘not 1

a 0
senior 0
Labour 0

has 0
said.” 0

For 0
Chris 0
Bryant, 0
apparently 0
“fascism” 0
means 0
“defense 1
of 1
Britain 1
and 1
its 1
values 1
against 0
jihad 0
terror.” 0

Bryant 0
“cited 0
the 0
cases 0

Why 0
are 0
we 0
“far 0
right”? 0

Everything 0
we 0
do 0
is 0
in 0
defense 0
of 0
the 0
freedom 0
of 0
speech 0
and 0
equality 0
of 0
rights 0
of 0
all 0
people 0
before 0
the 0
law. 0

That’s 0
“far 0
right”? 0

In 0
any 0
case, 0
note 0
well: 0
the 0
letter 0
to 0
me 0
from 0
the 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
said 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
banned 0
for 0
saying 0
that 0
“[Islam] 1
is 1
a 1
religion 1
and 1
is 1
a 1
belief 1
system 1
that 1
mandates 1
warfare 1
against 1
unbelievers…” 1

That’s 0
a 0
demonstrably 0
true 0
statement. 0

Meanwhile, 0
Britain 0
has 0
a 0
steadily 0
lengthening 0
record 0
of 0
admitting 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
without 0
a 0
moment 0
of 0
hesitation. 0

Syed 0
Muzaffar 0
Shah 0
Qadri’s 0
preaching 0
of 0
hatred 0
and 0
jihad 0
violence 0
was 0
so 0
hardline 0
that 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
preaching 0
in 0
Pakistan, 0
but 0
the 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
welcomed 0
him 0
into 0
Britain. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
also 0
admitted 0
Shaykh 0

the 0
fact 0
that 0

there’s 1

the 1

one 1

– 1
chop 1

off, 1
that’s 1
the 1
easiest. 1

– 1

them 1

Third 1
– 1
throw 1
’em 1
off 1
a 1

– 1
tear 1
down 1
a 1
wall 1

they 1

the 1
above.” 1

the 1

One 0
