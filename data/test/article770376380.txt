Pope 0 332 1

on 0 332 1
Saturday, 0 332 1
and 0 332 1
that 0 332 1
the 0 332 1
Pope 0 332 1
had 0 332 1
some 0 332 1
strong 0 332 1
words 0 332 1
to 0 332 1
say 0 332 1
about 0 332 1

in 0 332 1
the 0 332 1

The 0 332 2
Pope 0 332 2
couldn’t 1 332 2
resist 1 332 2
an 1 332 2
anti-Semitic 1 332 2
shot 1 332 2
at 1 332 2
Israeli 1 332 2
“occupation,” 1 332 2
but 0 332 2
he 0 332 2
also 0 332 2
seemed 0 332 2
to 0 332 2
denounce 0 332 2
Islamic 0 332 2
jihad 0 332 2
activity, 0 332 2
saying: 0 332 2
“So 0 332 2
many 0 332 2
conflicts 0 332 2
have 0 332 2
been 0 332 2
stoked 0 332 2
too 0 332 2
by 0 332 2
forms 0 332 2
of 0 332 2
fundamentalism 0 332 2
and 0 332 2
fanaticism 0 332 2
that, 0 332 2
under 0 332 2
the 0 332 2
guise 0 332 2
of 0 332 2
religion, 0 332 2
have 1 332 2
profaned 1 332 2
God’s 1 332 2
name 1 332 2
– 0 332 2
which 0 332 2
is 0 332 2
peace 0 332 2
– 0 332 2
and 0 332 2
persecuted 0 332 2
age-old 0 332 2
neighbors.” 0 332 2
He 1 332 2
decried 1 332 2
the 0 332 2
“thirst 0 332 2
for 0 332 2
profit 0 332 2
that 0 332 2
surreptitiously 0 332 2
exploits 0 332 2
oil 0 332 2
and 0 332 2
gas 0 332 2
fields 0 332 2
without 0 332 2
regard 0 332 2
for 0 332 2
our 0 332 2
common 0 332 2
home, 0 332 2
with 0 332 2
no 0 332 2
scruples 0 332 2
about 0 332 2
the 0 332 2
fact 0 332 2
that 0 332 2
the 0 332 2

market 0 332 2
now 0 332 2

of 0 332 2
coexistence 0 332 2
among 0 332 2
peoples!” 0 332 2

The 0 332 3
Pope 0 332 3
lamented 0 332 3
the 0 332 3
fact 0 332 3
that 0 332 3
in 0 332 3
recent 0 332 3
years 0 332 3
the 0 332 3
Middle 0 332 3
East 0 332 3
has 0 332 3
been 0 332 3
“covered 0 332 3
by 0 332 3
dark 0 332 3
clouds 0 332 3
of 0 332 3
war, 0 332 3
violence 0 332 3
and 0 332 3
destruction, 0 332 3
instances 0 332 3
of 0 332 3
occupation 0 332 3
and 0 332 3
varieties 0 332 3
of 0 332 3
fundamentalism, 0 332 3
forced 0 332 3
migration 0 332 3
and 0 332 3
neglect.” 0 332 3
And 0 332 3
he 1 332 3
deplored 1 332 3
the 1 332 3
fact 1 332 3
that 1 332 3
“all 0 332 3
this 0 332 3
has 0 332 3
taken 0 332 3
place 0 332 3
amid 0 332 3
the 0 332 3
complicit 0 332 3
silence 0 332 3
of 0 332 3
many. 0 332 3

The 0 332 4
Middle 0 332 4
East 0 332 4
has 0 332 4
become 0 332 4
a 0 332 4
land 0 332 4
of 0 332 4
people 0 332 4
who 0 332 4
leave 0 332 4
their 0 332 4
own 0 332 4
lands 0 332 4
behind.” 0 332 4
He 0 332 4
cried: 0 332 4
“Indifference 1 332 4
kills, 1 332 4
and 0 332 4
we 0 332 4
desire 0 332 4
to 0 332 4
lift 0 332 4
up 0 332 4
our 0 332 4
voices 0 332 4
in 0 332 4
opposition 0 332 4
to 0 332 4
this 0 332 4
murderous 1 332 4
indifference. 1 332 4

For 0 332 5
the 1 332 5
Middle 1 332 5
East 1 332 5
today 1 332 5
is 1 332 5
weeping, 1 332 5
suffering 1 332 5
and 1 332 5
silent 1 332 5
as 1 332 5
others 1 332 5
trample 1 332 5
upon 1 332 5
those 1 332 5
lands 1 332 5
in 0 332 5
search 0 332 5
of 0 332 5
power 0 332 5
or 0 332 5
riches.” 0 332 5

was 1 332 6
doing 1 332 6
the 1 332 6
persecuting, 1 332 6
and 1 332 6
implied 1 332 6
that 1 332 6
it 1 332 6
was 1 332 6
the 1 332 6

that 0 332 7

Catholic 0 332 30
Patriarch 0 332 30
Gregory 0 332 30
III 0 332 30
has 0 332 30
also 0 332 30
said: 0 332 30
“I 0 332 30
do 0 332 30
not 0 332 30
understand 0 332 30
why 0 332 30
the 0 332 30
world 0 332 30
does 0 332 30
not 0 332 30
raise 0 332 30
its 0 332 30
voice 0 332 30
against 0 332 30
such 0 332 30
acts 1 332 30
of 1 332 30
brutality.” 1 332 30

But 0 332 31
Gregory 0 332 31
III 0 332 31
should 0 332 31
have 0 332 31
understood, 0 332 31
since 0 332 31
he 0 332 31
was 0 332 31
a 0 332 31
major 0 332 31
part 0 332 31
of 0 332 31
the 0 332 31
problem. 0 332 31

He 0 332 32
himself 0 332 32
said: 0 332 32
“No 1 332 32
one 1 332 32
defends 1 332 32
Islam 1 332 32
like 1 332 32
Arab 1 332 32
Christians.” 1 332 32
It 1 332 32
is 1 332 32
to 1 332 32
defend 1 332 32
Islam 1 332 32
that 1 332 32
Western 1 332 32
clerics 1 332 32
do 1 332 32
not 1 332 32
raise 1 332 32
their 1 332 32
voice 1 332 32
against 1 332 32
such 1 332 32
acts 1 332 32
of 1 332 32
brutality. 1 332 32

It 1 332 33
is 1 332 33
to 1 332 33
pursue 1 332 33
a 1 332 33
fruitless 1 332 33
and 1 332 33
chimerical 1 332 33
“dialogue” 1 332 33
that 1 332 33
bishops 1 332 33
in 1 332 33
the 1 332 33
U.S. 1 332 33
and 1 332 33
Europe 1 332 33
keep 1 332 33
silent 1 332 33
about 1 332 33
Muslim 1 332 33
persecution 1 332 33
of 1 332 33
Christians, 1 332 33
and 1 332 33
enforce 1 332 33
that 1 332 33
silence 1 332 33
upon 1 332 33
others. 1 332 33
