doesn't 0 112 1
mince 0 112 1
words 0 112 1
when 0 112 1
it 0 112 1
comes 0 112 1
to 0 112 1
the 0 112 1
Muslim 1 112 1
invasion 1 112 1
in 0 112 1
Europe 0 112 1
and 0 112 1
specifically 0 112 1
to 0 112 1
his 0 112 1
own 0 112 1
country. 0 112 1

Orban 0 112 2
says 0 112 2
there 0 112 2
is 0 112 2
not 0 112 2
only 0 112 2
Muslim 1 112 2
invaders 1 112 2
in 0 112 2
the 0 112 2
mix 0 112 2
of 0 112 2
"refugees," 0 112 2
but 0 112 2
also 0 112 2
“economic 0 112 2

seeking 0 112 2
better 0 112 2
lives 0 112 2
for 0 112 2
themselves. 0 112 2

Indeed, 0 112 3
both 0 112 3
of 0 112 3
these 0 112 3
are 0 112 3
true. 0 112 3

There 0 112 4
are 0 112 4
plenty 0 112 4
of 0 112 4
these 0 112 4
people 0 112 4
who 0 112 4
are 0 112 4
simply 0 112 4
happy 0 112 4
to 0 112 4
have 0 112 4
a 0 112 4
place 0 112 4
to 0 112 4
live 0 112 4
after 0 112 4
many 0 112 4
were 0 112 4
driven 0 112 4
from 0 112 4
their 0 112 4
homes 0 112 4
due 0 112 4
to 0 112 4
the 0 112 4
US, 0 112 4
Russia 0 112 4
and 0 112 4
other 0 112 4
countries 0 112 4
putting 1 112 4
their 1 112 4
noses 1 112 4
where 0 112 4
they 0 112 4
didn't 0 112 4
belong 0 112 4
and 0 112 4
funding, 0 112 4

Then, 0 112 5
there 0 112 5
are 0 112 5
those 0 112 5
who 0 112 5
clearly 0 112 5

that 0 112 7

in 0 112 7
an 0 112 7

with 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
German 0 112 7
Bild 0 112 7
newspaper 0 112 7
why 0 112 7
Budapest 0 112 7
does 0 112 7
not 0 112 7
want 0 112 7
to 0 112 7
accept 0 112 7
any 0 112 7

Orban 0 112 7
replied: 0 112 7
“We 0 112 7
don’t 0 112 7
consider 0 112 7
these 0 112 7
people 0 112 7
to 0 112 7
be 0 112 7
Muslim 0 112 7
refugees.” 0 112 7
Instead, 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
tough-talking 0 112 7
politician 0 112 7
said 0 112 7
they 0 112 7
were 0 112 7
regarded 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
“Muslim 1 112 7
invaders.” 1 112 7
Asylum 0 112 7
seekers 0 112 7
must 0 112 7
cross 0 112 7
four 0 112 7
countries 0 112 7
to 0 112 7
reach 0 112 7
Hungary 0 112 7
from 0 112 7
Syria, 0 112 7
all 0 112 7
of 0 112 7
which 0 112 7
are 0 112 7
not 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
rich 0 112 7
as 0 112 7
Germany 0 112 7
but 0 112 7
are 0 112 7
economically 0 112 7
stable, 0 112 7
the 0 112 7
PM 0 112 7
said. 0 112 7

He 0 112 8
was 0 112 8
apparently 0 112 8
referring 0 112 8
to 0 112 8
Turkey, 0 112 8
Greece, 0 112 8
Macedonia 0 112 8
and 0 112 8
Serbia 0 112 8
– 0 112 8
a 0 112 8
common 0 112 8
route 0 112 8
for 0 112 8
migrants 0 112 8
heading 0 112 8
for 0 112 8
‘wealthy’ 0 112 8
Europe. 0 112 8

“So, 0 112 9
they 0 112 9
are 0 112 9
not 0 112 9
running 0 112 9
for 0 112 9
their 0 112 9
lives 0 112 9
[in 0 112 9
these 0 112 9
countries]. 0 112 9

They 0 112 10
are 0 112 10
merely 0 112 10
economic 0 112 10
migrants 0 112 10
seeking 0 112 10
a 0 112 10
better 0 112 10
life,” 0 112 10
Orban 0 112 10
concluded. 0 112 10

He 0 112 11
stressed 0 112 11
though, 0 112 11
that 0 112 11
he 0 112 11
can 0 112 11
only 0 112 11
speak 0 112 11
for 0 112 11
the 0 112 11
Hungarians 0 112 11
and 0 112 11
they 1 112 11
“don’t 1 112 11
want” 1 112 11
immigration. 1 112 11

In 0 112 12
his 0 112 12
view, 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
government 0 112 12
simply 0 112 12
can’t 0 112 12
go 0 112 12
against 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
will 0 112 12
of 0 112 12
the 0 112 12
people. 0 112 12

And 0 112 13
Orban 0 112 13
has 0 112 13
stayed 0 112 13
the 0 112 13
course, 0 112 13
too 0 112 13
while 0 112 13
governments 0 112 13
like 0 112 13
that 0 112 13
of 0 112 13
Germany 0 112 13
have 0 112 13
ignored 0 112 13
their 0 112 13
people 0 112 13
to 0 112 13
allow 0 112 13
for 0 112 13
a 0 112 13
clear 0 112 13
invasion 0 112 13
of 0 112 13
Germany 0 112 13
that 0 112 13
has 0 112 13
led 0 112 13
to 0 112 13
untold 1 112 13
numbers 1 112 13
of 0 112 13
sexual 1 112 13
assaults 1 112 13
by 1 112 13
Muslim 1 112 13
migrants, 1 112 13
attacks 1 112 13
on 1 112 13
Christians 1 112 13
and 1 112 13
there's 1 112 13
no 1 112 13
telling 1 112 13
the 1 112 13
amount 1 112 13
of 1 112 13
damage 1 112 13
to 1 112 13
the 1 112 13
unethical 1 112 13
welfare 1 112 13
system 1 112 13
in 1 112 13
the 1 112 13
country. 1 112 13

Going 0 112 15
further, 0 112 15
the 0 112 15
prime 0 112 15
minister 0 112 15
noted 0 112 15
that 0 112 15
no 0 112 15
refugee 0 112 15
wants 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
go 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
Portugal, 0 112 15
for 0 112 15
example, 0 112 15
adding 0 112 15
that 0 112 15
the 0 112 15
majority 0 112 15
of 0 112 15
asylum 0 112 15
seekers 0 112 15
simply 0 112 15
wanted 0 112 15
to 0 112 15
live 0 112 15
in 0 112 15
prosperous 0 112 15
Germany. 0 112 15

“The 1 112 16
reason 1 112 16
why 1 112 16
people 1 112 16
are 1 112 16
in 1 112 16
your 1 112 16
country 1 112 16
is 1 112 16
not 1 112 16
because 1 112 16
they 1 112 16
are 1 112 16
refugees, 1 112 16
but 1 112 16
because 1 112 16
they 1 112 16
want 1 112 16
a 1 112 16
German 1 112 16
life,” 1 112 16
he 0 112 16
said, 0 112 16
describing 0 112 16
the 0 112 16
issue 0 112 16
“politically” 0 112 16
as 0 112 16
a 0 112 16
European 0 112 16
problem 0 112 16
but, 0 112 16
“sociologically,” 0 112 16
as 0 112 16
a 0 112 16
German 0 112 16
problem. 0 112 16

Orban 0 112 17
specifically 0 112 17
targeted 0 112 17
Germany 0 112 17
and 0 112 17
Chancellor 0 112 17
Angela 0 112 17
Merkel’s 0 112 17
‘open-door’ 0 112 17
policy 0 112 17
towards 0 112 17
asylum 0 112 17
seekers. 0 112 17

“I’ve 0 112 18
never 0 112 18
understood 0 112 18
how 0 112 18
chaos, 1 112 18
anarchy 1 112 18
and 1 112 18
illegal 1 112 18
border 1 112 18
crossings 1 112 18
are 0 112 18
viewed 0 112 18
as 0 112 18
something 0 112 18
good 0 112 18
in 0 112 18
a 0 112 18
country 0 112 18
like 0 112 18
Germany, 0 112 18
which 0 112 18
we 0 112 18
view 0 112 18
as 0 112 18
the 1 112 18
best 1 112 18
example 1 112 18
of 1 112 18
discipline 1 112 18
and 1 112 18
the 1 112 18
rule 1 112 18
of 1 112 18
law,” 1 112 18
he 0 112 18
said. 0 112 18

The 0 112 19
recent 0 112 19
wave 0 112 19
of 0 112 19
refugees 0 112 19
reaching 0 112 19
Europe 0 112 19
is 0 112 19
merely 0 112 19
an 0 112 19
invasion, 1 112 19
according 0 112 19
to 0 112 19
Orban. 0 112 19

“If 0 112 20
someone 0 112 20
wants 0 112 20
to 0 112 20
come 0 112 20
to 0 112 20
your 0 112 20
house, 0 112 20
he 0 112 20
knocks 0 112 20
on 0 112 20
your 0 112 20
door 0 112 20
and 0 112 20
asks: 0 112 20
‘Can 0 112 20
we 0 112 20
come 0 112 20
in, 0 112 20
can 0 112 20
we 0 112 20
stay?’ 0 112 20
They 0 112 20
[asylum 0 112 20
seekers] 0 112 20
didn’t 0 112 20
do 0 112 20
that, 0 112 20
they 0 112 20
crossed 0 112 20
the 0 112 20
border 0 112 20
illegally,” 0 112 20
he 0 112 20
stated. 0 112 20

Orban 0 112 21
then 0 112 21
did 0 112 21
what 0 112 21
most 0 112 21
political 0 112 21
representatives 0 112 21
will 0 112 21
simply 0 112 21
not 0 112 21
do, 0 112 21
he 0 112 21
told 0 112 21
the 0 112 21
truth 0 112 21
about 0 112 21
multiculturalism. 0 112 21

He 0 112 22
called 0 112 22
it 0 112 22
an 0 112 22
"illusion" 0 112 22
and 0 112 22
said 0 112 22
that 0 112 22
Christian 1 112 22
and 1 112 22
Muslim 1 112 22
societies 1 112 22
“will 1 112 22
never 1 112 22
unite.” 1 112 22

Of 0 112 23
course, 0 112 23
they 0 112 23
won't. 0 112 23

They 1 112 24
have 1 112 24
absolutely 1 112 24
nothing 1 112 24
in 1 112 24
common. 1 112 24

They 1 112 25
cannot 1 112 25
agree 1 112 25
on 1 112 25
God's 1 112 25
law, 1 112 25
which 1 112 25
most 1 112 25
Western 1 112 25
societies 1 112 25
were 1 112 25
base 1 112 25
on, 1 112 25
including 1 112 25
the 1 112 25
united 1 112 25
States. 1 112 25

They 1 112 26
cannot 1 112 26
agree 1 112 26
on 0 112 26
the 0 112 26
Scriptures. 0 112 26

They 1 112 27
cannot 1 112 27
agree 1 112 27
on 1 112 27
the 0 112 27
person 0 112 27
and 0 112 27
work 0 112 27
of 0 112 27
Jesus 0 112 27
the 0 112 27
Christ. 0 112 27

They 0 112 28
can't 0 112 28
even 0 112 28
agree 0 112 28
on 0 112 28
the 0 112 28
means 0 112 28
of 0 112 28
proselytizing 0 112 28
and 0 112 28
of 0 112 28
what 0 112 28
real 0 112 28
spiritual 0 112 28
weapons 0 112 28
are. 0 112 28

PM 0 112 29
Orban 0 112 29
has 0 112 29
remained 0 112 29
consistent. 0 112 29

He 0 112 30
has 0 112 30
publicly 0 112 30
told 0 112 30
the 0 112 30
Muslim 1 112 30
invaders 1 112 30
to 0 112 30
leave 1 112 30
Hungary 1 112 30
and 1 112 30
never 1 112 30
come 1 112 30
back. 1 112 30

He 0 112 31
has 0 112 31
rebuffed 0 112 31
Brussels, 0 112 31
which 0 112 31
is 0 112 31
largely 0 112 31
Islamic, 0 112 31
and 0 112 31
told 0 112 31
them 0 112 31
that 0 112 31
Hungary 1 112 31
would 1 112 31
defend 1 112 31
its 1 112 31
borders, 1 112 31
and 1 112 31
it 1 112 31
has. 1 112 31

Orban's 0 112 32
border 0 112 32
wall 0 112 32
reduced 0 112 32
illegal 0 112 32
immigration 0 112 32
by 0 112 32
99%! 0 112 32

He 1 112 33
has 1 112 33
genuinely 1 112 33
reached 1 112 33
out 1 112 33
his 1 112 33
hand 1 112 33
to 1 112 33
help 1 112 33
