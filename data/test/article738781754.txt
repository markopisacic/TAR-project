the 0
most 0
important 0

the 0
first 0
Republican 0
to 0
say 0
he 0
will 0
attempt 0
to 0
block 0
the 0
nominees; 0
but 0
he 0
isn’t 0
the 0
first 0
Republican 0
to 0
express 0
concern. 0

John 0
McCain 0
of 0

said 0
Tuesday 0
that 0
he 0
wanted 0
answers 0
about 0
Haspel’s 0
background 0
running 0
CIA 0
torture 0
programs 0
prior 0

made 0
on 0
the 0
campaign 0
trail. 0

“I’m 0
perplexed 1
by 1
the 0
nomination 0
of 0
people 0
who 0
love 1
the 1
Iraq 1
War 1
so 0
much 0
that 0
they 0
would 0
advocate 0
for 0
a 0
war 0
with 0
Iran 0
next. 0

I 0
think 0
it 0
goes 0
against 0
most 0
of 0
the 0
things 0
President 0
Trump 0
campaigned 0
on,” 0
he 0
said. 0

The 0
lawmaker 0
added 0
that 0
he 0
can’t 0
support 0

described 0
as 0
having 0
expressed 0
“joyful 1
glee” 1
at 0
being 0
involved 0
in 0
torture 0
programs 0
in 0
the 0
past. 0

“I 0
find 1
it 1
just 1
amazing 1
that 1
anyone 1
would 1
consider 1
having 1
this 1
woman 1
at 1
the 1
head 1
of 1
the 1
CIA,” 1
