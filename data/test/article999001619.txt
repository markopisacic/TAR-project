that 0 21 1
finally 0 21 1
there 0 21 1

Reporter 1 21 2
Luke 1 21 2
Harding’s 1 21 2
latest 1 21 2
article, 1 21 2
claiming 1 21 2
that 1 21 2
Donald 1 21 2
Trump’s 1 21 2
disgraced 1 21 2
former 1 21 2
campaign 1 21 2
manager 1 21 2

Assange 1 21 2
in 1 21 2
Ecuador’s 1 21 2
embassy 1 21 2
in 1 21 2
London 1 21 2
on 1 21 2
three 1 21 2
occasions, 1 21 2
is 1 21 2
so 1 21 2
full 1 21 2
of 1 21 2
holes 1 21 2
that 1 21 2
even 1 21 2
hardened 1 21 2
opponents 1 21 2
of 1 21 2
Assange 1 21 2
in 1 21 2
the 1 21 2
corporate 1 21 2
media 1 21 2
are 1 21 2
struggling 1 21 2
to 1 21 2
stand 1 21 2
by 1 21 2
it. 1 21 2

Faced 1 21 3
with 1 21 3
the 1 21 3
backlash, 1 21 3
the 1 21 3
Guardian 1 21 3
quickly 1 21 3
– 1 21 3
and 1 21 3
very 1 21 3
quietly 1 21 3
– 1 21 3
rowed 1 21 3
back 1 21 3
its 1 21 3
initial 1 21 3
certainty 1 21 3
that 1 21 3
its 1 21 3
story 1 21 3
was 1 21 3
based 1 21 3
on 1 21 3
verified 1 21 3
facts. 1 21 3

Instead, 1 21 4
it 1 21 4
amended 1 21 4
the 1 21 4
text, 1 21 4
without 1 21 4
acknowledging 1 21 4
it 1 21 4
had 1 21 4
done 1 21 4
so, 1 21 4
to 1 21 4
attribute 1 21 4
the 1 21 4
claims 1 21 4
to 1 21 4
unnamed, 1 21 4
and 1 21 4
uncheckable, 1 21 4
“sources”. 1 21 4

The 1 21 5
propaganda 1 21 5
function 1 21 5
of 1 21 5
the 1 21 5
piece 1 21 5
is 1 21 5
patent. 1 21 5

It 0 21 6
is 0 21 6
intended 0 21 6
to 0 21 6
provide 0 21 6
evidence 0 21 6
for 0 21 6
long-standing 0 21 6
allegations 0 21 6
that 0 21 6
Assange 0 21 6
conspired 0 21 6
with 0 21 6
Trump, 0 21 6
and 0 21 6
Trump’s 0 21 6
supposed 0 21 6
backers 0 21 6
in 0 21 6
the 0 21 6
Kremlin, 0 21 6
to 0 21 6
damage 0 21 6
Hillary 0 21 6

during 0 21 6
the 0 21 6
2016 0 21 6
presidential 0 21 6
race. 0 21 6

The 1 21 7
Guardian’s 1 21 7
latest 1 21 7
story 1 21 7
provides 1 21 7
a 1 21 7
supposedly 1 21 7
stronger 1 21 7
foundation 1 21 7
for 1 21 7
an 1 21 7
existing 1 21 7
narrative: 1 21 7
that 1 21 7
Assange 1 21 7
and 1 21 7
Wikileaks 1 21 7
knowingly 1 21 7
published 1 21 7
emails 1 21 7
hacked 1 21 7
by 1 21 7
Russia 1 21 7
from 1 21 7
the 1 21 7
Democratic 1 21 7
party’s 1 21 7
servers. 1 21 7

In 1 21 8
truth, 1 21 8
there 1 21 8
is 1 21 8
no 1 21 8
public 1 21 8
evidence 1 21 8
that 1 21 8
the 1 21 8
emails 1 21 8
were 1 21 8
hacked, 1 21 8
or 1 21 8
that 1 21 8
Russia 1 21 8
was 1 21 8
involved. 1 21 8

Central 1 21 9
actors 1 21 9
have 1 21 9
suggested 1 21 9
instead 1 21 9
that 1 21 9
the 1 21 9
emails 1 21 9
were 1 21 9
leaked 1 21 9
from 1 21 9
within 1 21 9
the 1 21 9
Democratic 1 21 9
party. 1 21 9

Nonetheless, 0 21 10
this 0 21 10
unverified 0 21 10
allegation 0 21 10
has 0 21 10
been 0 21 10
aggressively 1 21 10
exploited 1 21 10
by 0 21 10
the 0 21 10
Democratic 0 21 10
leadership 0 21 10
because 0 21 10
it 0 21 10
shifts 0 21 10
attention 0 21 10
away 0 21 10
both 0 21 10
from 0 21 10
its 0 21 10
failure 0 21 10
to 0 21 10
mount 0 21 10
an 0 21 10
effective 0 21 10
electoral 0 21 10
challenge 0 21 10
to 0 21 10
Trump 0 21 10
and 0 21 10
from 0 21 10
the 0 21 10
damaging 0 21 10
contents 0 21 10
of 0 21 10
the 0 21 10
emails. 0 21 10

These 0 21 11
show 0 21 11
that 0 21 11
party 0 21 11
bureaucrats 0 21 11
sought 0 21 11
to 0 21 11
rig 0 21 11
the 0 21 11
primaries 0 21 11
to 0 21 11
make 0 21 11
sure 0 21 11
Clinton’s 0 21 11
challenger 0 21 11
for 0 21 11
the 0 21 11
Democratic 0 21 11
nomination, 0 21 11
Bernie 0 21 11
Sanders, 0 21 11
lost. 0 21 11

To 0 21 12
underscore 0 21 12
the 0 21 12
intended 0 21 12
effect 0 21 12
of 0 21 12
the 0 21 12
Guardian’s 0 21 12
new 0 21 12
claims, 0 21 12
Harding 0 21 12
even 0 21 12
throws 0 21 12
in 0 21 12
a 0 21 12
casual 0 21 12
and 0 21 12
unsubstantiated 0 21 12
reference 0 21 12
to 0 21 12
“Russians” 1 21 12
joining 0 21 12
Manafort 0 21 12
in 0 21 12
supposedly 0 21 12
meeting 0 21 12
Assange. 0 21 12

Manafort 0 21 13
has 0 21 13
denied 0 21 13
the 0 21 13
Guardian’s 0 21 13
claims, 0 21 13
while 0 21 13
Assange 0 21 13
has 0 21 13
threatened 0 21 13
to 0 21 13
sue 0 21 13
the 0 21 13
Guardian 0 21 13
for 0 21 13
libel. 0 21 13

‘Responsible 0 21 14
for 0 21 14
Trump’ 0 21 14

The 0 21 15
emotional 0 21 15
impact 0 21 15
of 0 21 15
the 0 21 15
Guardian 0 21 15
story 0 21 15
is 0 21 15
to 0 21 15
suggest 0 21 15
that 0 21 15
Assange 0 21 15
is 0 21 15
responsible 0 21 15
for 0 21 15
four 0 21 15
years 0 21 15
or 0 21 15
more 0 21 15
of 0 21 15
Trump 0 21 15
rule. 0 21 15

But 0 21 16
more 0 21 16
significantly, 0 21 16
it 0 21 16
bolsters 0 21 16
the 0 21 16
otherwise 0 21 16
risible 0 21 16
claim 0 21 16
that 0 21 16
Assange 0 21 16
is 0 21 16
not 0 21 16
a 0 21 16
publisher 0 21 16
– 0 21 16
and 0 21 16
thereby 0 21 16
entitled 0 21 16
to 0 21 16
the 0 21 16
protections 0 21 16
of 0 21 16
a 0 21 16
free 0 21 16
press, 0 21 16
as 0 21 16
enjoyed 0 21 16
by 0 21 16
the 0 21 16
Guardian 0 21 16
or 0 21 16
the 0 21 16
New 0 21 16
York 0 21 16
Times 0 21 16
– 0 21 16
but 0 21 16
the 1 21 16
head 1 21 16
of 1 21 16
an 1 21 16
organisation 1 21 16
engaged 1 21 16
in 1 21 16
espionage 1 21 16
for 1 21 16
a 1 21 16
foreign 1 21 16
power. 1 21 16

The 0 21 17
intention 0 21 17
is 0 21 17
to 0 21 17
deeply 0 21 17
discredit 0 21 17
Assange, 0 21 17
and 0 21 17
by 0 21 17
extension 0 21 17
the 0 21 17
Wikileaks 0 21 17
organisation, 0 21 17
in 0 21 17
the 0 21 17
eyes 0 21 17
of 0 21 17
right-thinking 0 21 17
liberals. 0 21 17

That, 0 21 18
in 0 21 18
turn, 0 21 18
will 0 21 18
make 0 21 18
it 0 21 18
much 0 21 18
easier 0 21 18
to 0 21 18
silence 0 21 18
Assange 0 21 18
and 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
vital 0 21 18
cause 0 21 18
he 0 21 18
represents: 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
use 0 21 18
of 0 21 18
new 0 21 18
media 0 21 18
to 0 21 18
hold 0 21 18
to 0 21 18
account 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
old, 0 21 18
corporate 0 21 18
media 0 21 18
and 0 21 18
political 0 21 18
elites 0 21 18
through 0 21 18
the 0 21 18
imposition 0 21 18
of 0 21 18
far 0 21 18
greater 0 21 18
transparency. 0 21 18

The 0 21 19
Guardian 0 21 19
story 0 21 19
will 0 21 19
prepare 0 21 19
public 0 21 19
opinion 0 21 19
for 0 21 19
the 0 21 19
moment 0 21 19
when 0 21 19
Ecuador’s 0 21 19
rightwing 0 21 19
government 0 21 19
under 0 21 19
President 0 21 19
Lenin 0 21 19
Moreno 0 21 19
forces 0 21 19
Assange 0 21 19
out 0 21 19
of 0 21 19
the 0 21 19
embassy, 0 21 19
having 0 21 19
already 0 21 19
withdrawn 0 21 19
most 0 21 19
of 0 21 19
his 0 21 19
rights 0 21 19
to 0 21 19
use 0 21 19
digital 0 21 19
media. 0 21 19

It 0 21 20
will 0 21 20
soften 0 21 20
opposition 0 21 20
when 0 21 20
the 0 21 20
UK 0 21 20
moves 0 21 20
to 0 21 20
arrest 0 21 20

on 0 21 20
self-serving 0 21 20
bail 0 21 20

and 0 21 20
extradites 0 21 20
him 0 21 20
to 0 21 20
the 0 21 20
US. 0 21 20

And 0 21 21
it 0 21 21
will 0 21 21
pave 0 21 21
the 0 21 21
way 0 21 21
for 0 21 21
the 0 21 21
US 0 21 21
legal 0 21 21
system 0 21 21
to 0 21 21
lock 0 21 21
Assange 0 21 21
up 0 21 21
for 0 21 21
a 0 21 21
very 0 21 21
long 0 21 21
time. 0 21 21

For 0 21 22
the 0 21 22
best 0 21 22
part 0 21 22
of 0 21 22
a 0 21 22
decade, 0 21 22
any 0 21 22

that 0 21 22
avoiding 0 21 22
this 0 21 22
fate 0 21 22
was 0 21 22
the 0 21 22
reason 0 21 22
Assange 0 21 22
originally 0 21 22
sought 0 21 22
asylum 0 21 22
in 0 21 22
the 0 21 22

was 1 21 22
ridiculed 1 21 22

not 0 21 22

at 0 21 22
the 0 21 22

Even 1 21 23
when 1 21 23
a 1 21 23

of 1 21 23

ruled 1 21 23
in 1 21 23
2016 1 21 23
that 1 21 23

was 1 21 23
being 1 21 23
arbitrarily 1 21 23
– 1 21 23
and 1 21 23
unlawfully 1 21 23
– 1 21 23
detained 1 21 23
by 1 21 23
the 1 21 23

have 0 21 25

that 1 21 28

without 0 21 31
their 0 21 31
trail, 0 21 31
entry 0 21 31
and 0 21 31
meeting 0 21 31
being 0 21 31
intimately 0 21 31
scrutinised 0 21 31
and 0 21 31
recorded 0 21 31
is 0 21 31
simply 1 21 31
preposterous. 1 21 31

According 1 21 32
to 1 21 32
Greenwald: 1 21 32
“If 1 21 32
Paul 1 21 32
Manafort 1 21 32
… 1 21 32
visited 1 21 32
Assange 1 21 32
at 1 21 32
the 1 21 32
Embassy, 1 21 32
there 1 21 32
would 1 21 32
be 1 21 32
ample 1 21 32
amounts 1 21 32
of 1 21 32
video 1 21 32
and 1 21 32
other 1 21 32
photographic 1 21 32
proof 1 21 32
demonstrating 1 21 32
that 1 21 32
this 1 21 32
happened. 1 21 32

The 1 21 33
Guardian 1 21 33
provides 1 21 33
none 1 21 33
of 1 21 33
that.” 1 21 33

Former 0 21 34
British 0 21 34
ambassador 0 21 34
Craig 0 21 34
Murray 0 21 34
also 0 21 34
points 0 21 34
out 0 21 34
the 0 21 34
extensive 0 21 34
security 0 21 34
checks 0 21 34
insisted 0 21 34
on 0 21 34
by 0 21 34
the 0 21 34
embassy 0 21 34
to 0 21 34
which 0 21 34
any 0 21 34
visitor 0 21 34
to 0 21 34
Assange 0 21 34
must 0 21 34
submit. 0 21 34

Any 0 21 35
visits 0 21 35
by 0 21 35
Manafort 0 21 35
would 0 21 35
have 0 21 35
been 0 21 35
logged. 0 21 35

In 1 21 36
fact, 1 21 36
the 1 21 36
Guardian 1 21 36
obtained 1 21 36
the 1 21 36
embassy’s 1 21 36
logs 1 21 36
in 1 21 36
May, 1 21 36
and 1 21 36
has 1 21 36
never 1 21 36
made 1 21 36
any 1 21 36
mention 1 21 36
of 1 21 36
either 1 21 36
Manafort 1 21 36
or 1 21 36
“Russians” 1 21 36
being 1 21 36
identified 1 21 36
in 1 21 36
them. 1 21 36

It 1 21 37
did 1 21 37
not 1 21 37
refer 1 21 37
to 1 21 37
the 1 21 37
logs 1 21 37
in 1 21 37
its 1 21 37
latest 1 21 37
story. 1 21 37

Murray: 0 21 38

The 0 21 39
problem 0 21 39
with 0 21 39
this 1 21 39
latest 1 21 39
fabrication 1 21 39
is 0 21 39
that 0 21 39
[Ecuador’s 0 21 39
President] 0 21 39
Moreno 0 21 39
had 0 21 39
already 0 21 39
released 0 21 39
the 0 21 39
visitor 0 21 39
logs 0 21 39
to 0 21 39
the 0 21 39
Mueller 0 21 39
inquiry. 0 21 39

Neither 0 21 40
Manafort 0 21 40
nor 0 21 40
these 0 21 40
“Russians” 1 21 40
are 0 21 40
in 0 21 40
the 0 21 40
visitor 0 21 40
logs 0 21 40
… 0 21 40
What 0 21 40
possible 0 21 40
motive 0 21 40
would 0 21 40
the 0 21 40
Ecuadorean 0 21 40
government 0 21 40
have 0 21 40
for 0 21 40
facilitating 0 21 40
secret 0 21 40
unrecorded 0 21 40
visits 0 21 40
by 0 21 40
Paul 0 21 40
Manafort? 0 21 40

Furthermore 0 21 41
it 0 21 41
is 0 21 41
impossible 0 21 41
that 0 21 41
the 0 21 41
intelligence 0 21 41
agency 0 21 41
– 0 21 41
who 0 21 41
were 0 21 41
in 0 21 41
charge 0 21 41
of 0 21 41
the 0 21 41
security 0 21 41
– 0 21 41
would 0 21 41
not 0 21 41
know 0 21 41
the 0 21 41
identity 0 21 41
of 0 21 41
these 0 21 41
alleged 0 21 41
“Russians”. 1 21 41

No 1 21 42
fact-checking 1 21 42

It 1 21 43
is 1 21 43
worth 1 21 43
noting 1 21 43
it 1 21 43
should 1 21 43
be 1 21 43
vitally 1 21 43
important 1 21 43
for 1 21 43
a 1 21 43
serious 1 21 43
publication 1 21 43
like 1 21 43
the 1 21 43
Guardian 1 21 43
to 1 21 43
ensure 1 21 43
its 1 21 43
claims 1 21 43
are 1 21 43
unassailably 1 21 43
true 1 21 43
– 1 21 43
both 1 21 43
because 1 21 43
Assange’s 1 21 43
personal 1 21 43
fate 1 21 43
rests 1 21 43
on 1 21 43
their 1 21 43
veracity, 1 21 43
and 1 21 43
because, 1 21 43
even 1 21 43
more 1 21 43
importantly, 1 21 43
a 1 21 43
fundamental 1 21 43
right, 1 21 43
the 1 21 43
freedom 1 21 43
of 1 21 43
the 1 21 43
press, 1 21 43
is 1 21 43
at 1 21 43
stake. 1 21 43

Given 1 21 44
this, 1 21 44
one 1 21 44
would 1 21 44
have 1 21 44
expected 1 21 44
the 1 21 44
Guardian’s 1 21 44
editors 1 21 44
to 1 21 44
have 1 21 44
insisted 1 21 44
on 1 21 44
the 1 21 44
most 1 21 44
stringent 1 21 44
checks 1 21 44
imaginable 1 21 44
before 1 21 44
going 1 21 44
to 1 21 44
press 1 21 44
with 1 21 44
Harding’s 1 21 44
story. 1 21 44

At 1 21 45
a 1 21 45
very 1 21 45
minimum, 1 21 45
they 1 21 45
should 1 21 45
have 1 21 45
sought 1 21 45
out 1 21 45
a 1 21 45
response 1 21 45
from 1 21 45
Assange 1 21 45
and 1 21 45
Manafort 1 21 45
before 1 21 45
publication. 1 21 45

Neither 1 21 46
precaution 1 21 46
was 1 21 46
taken. 1 21 46

I 1 21 47
worked 1 21 47
for 1 21 47
the 1 21 47
Guardian 1 21 47
for 1 21 47
a 1 21 47
number 1 21 47
of 1 21 47
years, 1 21 47
and 1 21 47
know 1 21 47
well 1 21 47
the 1 21 47
layers 1 21 47
of 1 21 47
checks 1 21 47
that 1 21 47
any 1 21 47
highly 1 21 47
sensitive 1 21 47
story 1 21 47
has 1 21 47
to 1 21 47
go 1 21 47
through 1 21 47
before 1 21 47
publication. 1 21 47

In 1 21 48
that 1 21 48
lengthy 1 21 48
process, 1 21 48
a 1 21 48
variety 1 21 48
of 1 21 48
commissioning 1 21 48
editors, 1 21 48
lawyers, 1 21 48
backbench 1 21 48
editors 1 21 48
and 1 21 48
the 1 21 48
editor 1 21 48
herself, 1 21 48
Kath 1 21 48
Viner, 1 21 48
would 1 21 48
normally 1 21 48
insist 1 21 48
on 1 21 48
cuts 1 21 48
to 1 21 48
anything 1 21 48
that 1 21 48
could 1 21 48
not 1 21 48
be 1 21 48
rigorously 1 21 48
defended 1 21 48
and 1 21 48
corroborated. 1 21 48

And 1 21 49
yet 1 21 49
this 1 21 49
piece 1 21 49
seems 1 21 49
to 1 21 49
have 1 21 49
been 1 21 49
casually 1 21 49
waved 1 21 49
through, 1 21 49
given 1 21 49
a 1 21 49
green 1 21 49
light 1 21 49
even 1 21 49
though 1 21 49
its 1 21 49
profound 1 21 49
shortcomings 1 21 49
were 1 21 49
evident 1 21 49
to 1 21 49
a 1 21 49
range 1 21 49
of 1 21 49
well-placed 1 21 49
analysts 1 21 49
and 1 21 49
journalists 1 21 49
from 1 21 49
the 1 21 49
outset. 1 21 49

That 0 21 50
at 0 21 50
the 0 21 50
very 0 21 50
least 0 21 50
hints 0 21 50
that 0 21 50
the 0 21 50
Guardian 0 21 50
thought 0 21 50
they 0 21 50
had 0 21 50
“insurance” 0 21 50
on 0 21 50
this 0 21 50
story. 0 21 50

And 0 21 51
the 0 21 51
only 0 21 51
people 0 21 51
who 0 21 51
could 0 21 51
have 0 21 51
promised 0 21 51
that 0 21 51
kind 0 21 51
of 0 21 51
insurance 0 21 51
are 0 21 51
the 0 21 51
security 0 21 51
and 0 21 51
intelligence 0 21 51
services 0 21 51
– 0 21 51
presumably 0 21 51
of 0 21 51
Britain, 0 21 51
the 0 21 51
United 0 21 51
States 0 21 51
and 0 21 51
/ 0 21 51
or 0 21 51
Ecuador. 0 21 51

It 1 21 52
appears 1 21 52
the 1 21 52
Guardian 1 21 52
has 1 21 52
simply 1 21 52
taken 1 21 52
this 1 21 52
story, 1 21 52
provided 1 21 52
by 1 21 52
spooks, 1 21 52
at 1 21 52
face 1 21 52
value. 1 21 52

Even 1 21 53
if 1 21 53
it 1 21 53
later 1 21 53
turns 1 21 53
out 1 21 53
that 1 21 53
Manafort 1 21 53
did 1 21 53
visit 1 21 53
Assange, 1 21 53
the 1 21 53
Guardian 1 21 53
clearly 1 21 53
had 1 21 53
no 1 21 53
compelling 1 21 53
evidence 1 21 53
for 1 21 53
its 1 21 53
claims 1 21 53
when 1 21 53
it 1 21 53
published 1 21 53
them. 1 21 53

That 1 21 54
is 1 21 54
profoundly 1 21 54
irresponsible 1 21 54
journalism 1 21 54
– 1 21 54
fake 1 21 54
news 1 21 54
– 1 21 54
that 1 21 54
should 1 21 54
be 1 21 54
of 1 21 54
the 1 21 54
gravest 1 21 54
concern 1 21 54
to 1 21 54
readers. 1 21 54

A 0 21 55
pattern, 0 21 55
not 0 21 55
an 0 21 55
aberration 0 21 55

Despite 1 21 56
all 1 21 56
this, 1 21 56
even 1 21 56
analysts 1 21 56
critical 1 21 56
of 1 21 56
the 1 21 56
Guardian’s 1 21 56
behaviour 1 21 56
have 1 21 56
shown 1 21 56
a 1 21 56
glaring 1 21 56
failure 1 21 56
to 1 21 56
understand 1 21 56
that 1 21 56
its 1 21 56
latest 1 21 56
coverage 1 21 56
represents 1 21 56
not 1 21 56
an 1 21 56
aberration 1 21 56
by 1 21 56
the 1 21 56
paper 1 21 56
but 1 21 56
decisively 1 21 56
fits 1 21 56
with 1 21 56
a 1 21 56
pattern. 1 21 56

Glenn 0 21 57
Greenwald, 0 21 57
who 0 21 57
once 0 21 57
had 0 21 57
an 0 21 57
influential 0 21 57
column 0 21 57
in 0 21 57
the 0 21 57
Guardian 0 21 57
until 0 21 57
an 0 21 57
apparent, 0 21 57
though 0 21 57
unacknowledged, 0 21 57
falling 0 21 57
out 0 21 57
with 0 21 57
his 0 21 57
employer 0 21 57
over 0 21 57
the 0 21 57
Edward 0 21 57
Snowden 0 21 57
revelations, 0 21 57
wrote 0 21 57
a 0 21 57
series 0 21 57
of 0 21 57
baffling 1 21 57
observations 1 21 57
about 0 21 57
the 0 21 57
Guardian’s 0 21 57
latest 0 21 57
story. 0 21 57

First, 0 21 58
he 0 21 58
suggested 0 21 58
it 0 21 58
was 0 21 58
simply 0 21 58
evidence 0 21 58
of 0 21 58
the 0 21 58
Guardian’s 0 21 58
long-standing 1 21 58
(and 1 21 58
well-documented) 1 21 58
hostility 1 21 58
towards 1 21 58
Assange. 1 21 58

“The 1 21 59
Guardian, 1 21 59
an 1 21 59
otherwise 1 21 59
solid 1 21 59
and 1 21 59
reliable 1 21 59
paper, 1 21 59
has 1 21 59
such 1 21 59
a 1 21 59
pervasive 1 21 59
and 1 21 59
unprofessionally 1 21 59
personal 1 21 59
hatred 1 21 59
for 1 21 59
Julian 1 21 59
Assange 1 21 59
that 1 21 59
it 1 21 59
has 1 21 59
frequently 1 21 59
dispensed 1 21 59
with 1 21 59
all 1 21 59
journalistic 1 21 59
standards 1 21 59
in 1 21 59
order 1 21 59
to 1 21 59
malign 1 21 59
him.” 1 21 59

It 1 21 60
was 1 21 60
also 1 21 60
apparently 1 21 60
evidence 1 21 60
of 1 21 60
the 1 21 60
paper’s 1 21 60
clickbait 1 21 60
tendencies: 1 21 60

“They 1 21 61
[Guardian 1 21 61
editors] 1 21 61
knew 1 21 61
that 1 21 61
publishing 1 21 61
this 1 21 61
story 1 21 61
would 1 21 61
cause 1 21 61
partisan 1 21 61
warriors 1 21 61
to 1 21 61
excitedly 1 21 61
spread 1 21 61
the 1 21 61
story, 1 21 61
and 1 21 61
that 1 21 61
cable 1 21 61
news 1 21 61
outlets 1 21 61
would 1 21 61
hyperventilate 1 21 61
over 1 21 61
it, 1 21 61
and 1 21 61
that 1 21 61
they’d 1 21 61
reap 1 21 61
the 1 21 61
rewards 1 21 61
regardless 1 21 61
of 1 21 61
whether 1 21 61
the 1 21 61
story 1 21 61
turned 1 21 61
out 1 21 61
to 1 21 61
be 1 21 61
true 1 21 61
or 1 21 61
false.” 1 21 61

And 0 21 62
finally, 0 21 62
in 0 21 62
a 1 21 62
bizarre 1 21 62
tweet, 1 21 62
Greenwald 0 21 62
opined, 0 21 62
“I 0 21 62
hope 0 21 62
the 0 21 62
story 0 21 62
[maligning 0 21 62
Assange] 0 21 62
turns 0 21 62
out 0 21 62
true” 0 21 62
– 0 21 62
apparently 1 21 62
because 1 21 62
maintenance 1 21 62
of 1 21 62
the 1 21 62
Guardian’s 1 21 62
reputation 1 21 62
is 1 21 62
more 1 21 62
important 1 21 62
than 1 21 62
Assange’s 1 21 62
fate 1 21 62
and 1 21 62
the 1 21 62
right 1 21 62
of 1 21 62
journalists 1 21 62
to 1 21 62
dig 1 21 62
up 1 21 62
embarrassing 1 21 62
secrets 1 21 62
without 1 21 62
fear 1 21 62
of 1 21 62
being 1 21 62
imprisoned. 1 21 62

I 0 21 63
think 0 21 63
the 0 21 63
Guardian 0 21 63
is 0 21 63
an 0 21 63
important 0 21 63
paper 0 21 63
with 0 21 63
great 0 21 63
journalists. 0 21 63

I 0 21 64
hope 0 21 64
the 0 21 64
story 0 21 64
turns 0 21 64
out 0 21 64
true. 0 21 64

But 0 21 65
the 0 21 65
skepticism 0 21 65
over 0 21 65
this 0 21 65
story 0 21 65
is 0 21 65
very 0 21 65
widespread, 0 21 65
including 0 21 65
among 0 21 65
Assange's 1 21 65
most 1 21 65
devoted 1 21 65
haters, 1 21 65
because 0 21 65
it's 0 21 65
so 0 21 65
sketchy. 0 21 65

If 0 21 66
Manafort 0 21 66
went 0 21 66
there, 0 21 66
there's 0 21 66
video. 0 21 66

Let's 0 21 67
see 0 21 67
it. 0 21 67

Deeper 0 21 69
malaise 0 21 69

What 0 21 70
this 0 21 70
misses 0 21 70
is 0 21 70
that 0 21 70
the 0 21 70
Guardian’s 0 21 70
attacks 0 21 70
on 0 21 70
Assange 0 21 70
are 0 21 70
not 0 21 70
exceptional 0 21 70
or 0 21 70
motivated 0 21 70
solely 0 21 70
by 0 21 70
personal 0 21 70
animosity. 0 21 70

They 0 21 71
are 0 21 71
entirely 0 21 71
predictable 0 21 71
and 0 21 71
systematic. 0 21 71

Rather 1 21 72
than 1 21 72
being 1 21 72
the 1 21 72
reason 1 21 72
for 1 21 72
the 1 21 72
Guardian 1 21 72
violating 1 21 72
basic 1 21 72
journalistic 1 21 72
standards 1 21 72
and 1 21 72
ethics, 1 21 72
the 1 21 72
paper’s 1 21 72
hatred 1 21 72
of 1 21 72
Assange 1 21 72
is 1 21 72
a 1 21 72
symptom 1 21 72
of 1 21 72
a 1 21 72
deeper 1 21 72
malaise 1 21 72
in 1 21 72
the 1 21 72
Guardian 1 21 72
and 1 21 72
the 1 21 72
wider 1 21 72
corporate 1 21 72
media. 1 21 72

Even 1 21 73
aside 1 21 73
from 1 21 73
its 1 21 73
decade-long 1 21 73
campaign 1 21 73
against 1 21 73
Assange, 1 21 73
the 1 21 73
Guardian 1 21 73
is 1 21 73
far 1 21 73
from 1 21 73
“solid 1 21 73
and 1 21 73
reliable”, 1 21 73
as 1 21 73
Greenwald 1 21 73
claims. 1 21 73

It 1 21 74
has 1 21 74
been 1 21 74
at 1 21 74
the 1 21 74
forefront 1 21 74
of 1 21 74
the 1 21 74
relentless, 1 21 74
and 1 21 74
unhinged, 1 21 74
attacks 1 21 74
on 1 21 74
Labour 1 21 74
leader 1 21 74
Jeremy 1 21 74
Corbyn 1 21 74
for 1 21 74
prioritising 1 21 74
the 1 21 74
rights 1 21 74
of 1 21 74
Palestinians 1 21 74
over 1 21 74
Israel’s 1 21 74
right 1 21 74
to 1 21 74
continue 1 21 74
its 1 21 74
belligerent 1 21 74
occupation. 1 21 74

Over 1 21 75
the 1 21 75
past 1 21 75
three 1 21 75
years, 1 21 75
the 1 21 75
Guardian 1 21 75
has 1 21 75
injected 1 21 75
credibility 1 21 75
into 1 21 75
the 1 21 75
Israel 1 21 75
lobby’s 1 21 75
desperate 1 21 75
efforts 1 21 75
to 1 21 75
tar 1 21 75
Corbyn 1 21 75
as 1 21 75
an 1 21 75
anti-semite. 1 21 75

See 0 21 76
here, 0 21 76
here 0 21 76
and 0 21 76
here. 0 21 76

Similarly, 1 21 77
the 1 21 77
Guardian 1 21 77
worked 1 21 77
tirelessly 1 21 77
to 1 21 77
promote 1 21 77
Clinton 1 21 77
and 1 21 77
undermine 1 21 77
Sanders 1 21 77
in 1 21 77
the 1 21 77
2016 1 21 77
Democratic 1 21 77
nomination 1 21 77
process 1 21 77
– 1 21 77
another 1 21 77
reason 1 21 77
the 1 21 77
paper 1 21 77
has 1 21 77
been 1 21 77
so 1 21 77
assiduous 1 21 77
in 1 21 77
promoting 1 21 77
the 1 21 77
idea 1 21 77
that 1 21 77
Assange, 1 21 77
aided 1 21 77
by 1 21 77
Russia, 1 21 77
was 1 21 77
determined 1 21 77
to 1 21 77
promote 1 21 77
Trump 1 21 77
over 1 21 77
Clinton 1 21 77
for 1 21 77
the 1 21 77
presidency. 1 21 77

The 1 21 78
Guardian’s 1 21 78
coverage 1 21 78
of 1 21 78
Latin 1 21 78
America, 1 21 78
especially 1 21 78
of 1 21 78
populist 1 21 78
leftwing 1 21 78
governments 1 21 78
that 1 21 78
have 1 21 78
rebelled 1 21 78
against 1 21 78
traditional 1 21 78
and 1 21 78
oppressive 1 21 78
US 1 21 78
hegemony 1 21 78
in 1 21 78
the 1 21 78
region, 1 21 78
has 1 21 78
long 1 21 78
grated 1 21 78
with 1 21 78
analysts 1 21 78
and 1 21 78
experts. 1 21 78

Its 1 21 79
especial 1 21 79
venom 1 21 79
has 1 21 79
been 1 21 79
reserved 1 21 79
for 1 21 79
leftwing 1 21 79
figures 1 21 79
like 1 21 79
Venezuela’s 1 21 79
Hugo 1 21 79
Chavez, 1 21 79
democratically 1 21 79
elected 1 21 79
but 1 21 79
official 1 21 79
enemies 1 21 79
of 1 21 79
the 1 21 79
US, 1 21 79
rather 1 21 79
than 1 21 79
the 1 21 79
region’s 1 21 79
rightwing 1 21 79
authoritarians 1 21 79
beloved 1 21 79
of 1 21 79
Washington. 1 21 79

The 1 21 80
Guardian 1 21 80
has 1 21 80
been 1 21 80
vocal 1 21 80
in 1 21 80
the 1 21 80
so-called 1 21 80
“fake 1 21 80
news” 1 21 80
hysteria, 1 21 80
decrying 1 21 80
the 1 21 80
influence 1 21 80
of 1 21 80
social 1 21 80
media, 1 21 80
the 1 21 80
only 1 21 80
place 1 21 80
where 1 21 80
leftwing 1 21 80
dissidents 1 21 80
have 1 21 80
managed 1 21 80
to 1 21 80
find 1 21 80
a 1 21 80
small 1 21 80
foothold 1 21 80
to 1 21 80
promote 1 21 80
their 1 21 80
politics 1 21 80
and 1 21 80
counter 1 21 80
the 1 21 80
corporate 1 21 80
media 1 21 80
narrative. 1 21 80

The 1 21 81
Guardian 1 21 81
has 1 21 81
painted 1 21 81
social 1 21 81
media 1 21 81
chiefly 1 21 81
as 1 21 81
a 1 21 81
platform 1 21 81
overrun 1 21 81
by 1 21 81
Russian 1 21 81
trolls, 1 21 81
arguing 1 21 81
that 1 21 81
this 1 21 81
should 1 21 81
justify 1 21 81
ever-tighter 1 21 81
restrictions 1 21 81
that 1 21 81
have 1 21 81
so 1 21 81
far 1 21 81
curbed 1 21 81
critical 1 21 81
voices 1 21 81
of 1 21 81
the 1 21 81
dissident 1 21 81
left 1 21 81
more 1 21 81
than 1 21 81
the 1 21 81
right. 1 21 81

Heroes 0 21 82
of 0 21 82
the 0 21 82
neoliberal 0 21 82
order 0 21 82

Equally, 1 21 83
the 1 21 83
Guardian 1 21 83
has 1 21 83
made 1 21 83
clear 1 21 83
who 1 21 83
its 1 21 83
true 1 21 83
heroes 1 21 83
are. 1 21 83

Certainly 1 21 84
not 1 21 84
Corbyn 1 21 84
or 1 21 84
Assange, 1 21 84
who 1 21 84
threaten 1 21 84
to 1 21 84
disrupt 1 21 84
the 1 21 84
entrenched 1 21 84
neoliberal 1 21 84
order 1 21 84
that 1 21 84
is 1 21 84
hurtling 1 21 84
us 1 21 84
towards 1 21 84
climate 1 21 84
breakdown 1 21 84
and 1 21 84
economic 1 21 84
collapse. 1 21 84

Its 1 21 85
pages, 1 21 85
however, 1 21 85
are 1 21 85
readily 1 21 85
available 1 21 85
to 1 21 85
the 1 21 85
latest 1 21 85
effort 1 21 85
to 1 21 85
prop 1 21 85
up 1 21 85
the 1 21 85
status 1 21 85
quo 1 21 85
from 1 21 85
Tony 1 21 85
Blair, 1 21 85
the 1 21 85
man 1 21 85
who 1 21 85
led 1 21 85
Britain, 1 21 85
on 1 21 85
false 1 21 85
pretences, 1 21 85
into 1 21 85
the 1 21 85
largest 1 21 85
crime 1 21 85
against 1 21 85
humanity 1 21 85
in 1 21 85
living 1 21 85
memory 1 21 85
– 1 21 85
the 1 21 85
attack 1 21 85
on 1 21 85
Iraq. 1 21 85

That 1 21 86
“humanitarian 1 21 86
intervention” 1 21 86
cost 1 21 86
the 1 21 86
lives 1 21 86
of 1 21 86
many 1 21 86
hundreds 1 21 86
of 1 21 86
thousands 1 21 86
of 1 21 86
Iraqis 1 21 86
and 1 21 86
created 1 21 86
a 1 21 86
vacuum 1 21 86
that 1 21 86
destabilised 1 21 86
much 1 21 86
of 1 21 86
the 1 21 86
Middle 1 21 86
East, 1 21 86
sucked 1 21 86
in 1 21 86
Islamic 1 21 86
jihadists 1 21 86
like 1 21 86
al-Qaeda 1 21 86
and 1 21 86
ISIS, 1 21 86
and 1 21 86
contributed 1 21 86
to 1 21 86
the 1 21 86
migrant 1 21 86
crisis 1 21 86
in 1 21 86
Europe 1 21 86
that 1 21 86
has 1 21 86
fuelled 1 21 86
the 1 21 86
resurgence 1 21 86
of 1 21 86
the 1 21 86
far-right. 1 21 86

None 1 21 87
of 1 21 87
that 1 21 87
is 1 21 87
discussed 1 21 87
in 1 21 87
the 1 21 87
Guardian 1 21 87
or 1 21 87
considered 1 21 87
grounds 1 21 87
for 1 21 87
disqualifying 1 21 87
Blair 1 21 87
as 1 21 87
an 1 21 87
arbiter 1 21 87
of 1 21 87
what 1 21 87
is 1 21 87
good 1 21 87
for 1 21 87
Britain 1 21 87
and 1 21 87
the 1 21 87
world’s 1 21 87
future. 1 21 87

The 1 21 88
Guardian 1 21 88
also 1 21 88
has 1 21 88
an 1 21 88
especial 1 21 88
soft 1 21 88
spot 1 21 88
for 1 21 88
blogger 1 21 88
Elliot 1 21 88
Higgins, 1 21 88
who, 1 21 88
aided 1 21 88
by 1 21 88
the 1 21 88
Guardian, 1 21 88
has 1 21 88
shot 1 21 88
to 1 21 88
unlikely 1 21 88
prominence 1 21 88
as 1 21 88
a 1 21 88
self-styled 1 21 88
“weapons 1 21 88
expert”. 1 21 88

Like 1 21 89
Luke 1 21 89
Harding, 1 21 89
Higgins 1 21 89
invariably 1 21 89
seems 1 21 89
ready 1 21 89
to 1 21 89
echo 1 21 89
whatever 1 21 89
the 1 21 89
British 1 21 89
and 1 21 89
American 1 21 89
security 1 21 89
services 1 21 89
need 1 21 89
verifying 1 21 89
“independently”. 1 21 89

Higgins 1 21 90
and 1 21 90
his 1 21 90
well-staffed 1 21 90
website 1 21 90
Bellingcat 1 21 90
have 1 21 90
taken 1 21 90
on 1 21 90
for 1 21 90
themselves 1 21 90
the 1 21 90
role 1 21 90
of 1 21 90
arbiters 1 21 90
of 1 21 90
truth 1 21 90
on 1 21 90
many 1 21 90
foreign 1 21 90
affairs 1 21 90
issues, 1 21 90
taking 1 21 90
a 1 21 90
prominent 1 21 90
role 1 21 90
in 1 21 90
advocating 1 21 90
for 1 21 90
narratives 1 21 90
that 1 21 90
promote 1 21 90
US 1 21 90
and 1 21 90
NATO 1 21 90
hegemony 1 21 90
while 1 21 90
demonising 1 21 90
Russia, 1 21 90
especially 1 21 90
in 1 21 90
highly 1 21 90
contested 1 21 90
arenas 1 21 90
such 1 21 90
as 1 21 90
Syria. 1 21 90

That 0 21 91
clear 0 21 91
partisanship 0 21 91
should 0 21 91
be 0 21 91
no 0 21 91
surprise, 0 21 91
given 0 21 91
that 0 21 91
Higgins 0 21 91
now 0 21 91
enjoys 0 21 91
an 0 21 91
“academic” 0 21 91
position 0 21 91
at, 0 21 91
and 0 21 91
funding 0 21 91
from, 0 21 91
the 0 21 91
Atlantic 0 21 91
Council, 0 21 91
a 1 21 91
high-level, 1 21 91
Washington-based 1 21 91
think-tank 1 21 91
founded 1 21 91
to 1 21 91
drum 1 21 91
up 1 21 91
support 1 21 91
for 1 21 91
NATO 1 21 91
and 1 21 91
justify 1 21 91
its 1 21 91
imperialist 1 21 91
agenda. 1 21 91

Improbably, 1 21 92
the 1 21 92
Guardian 1 21 92
has 1 21 92
adopted 1 21 92
Higgins 1 21 92
as 1 21 92
the 1 21 92
poster-boy 1 21 92
for 1 21 92
a 1 21 92
supposed 1 21 92
citizen 1 21 92
journalism 1 21 92
it 1 21 92
has 1 21 92
sought 1 21 92
to 1 21 92
undermine 1 21 92
as 1 21 92
“fake 1 21 92
news” 1 21 92
whenever 1 21 92
it 1 21 92
occurs 1 21 92
on 1 21 92
social 1 21 92
media 1 21 92
without 1 21 92
the 1 21 92
endorsement 1 21 92
of 1 21 92
state-backed 1 21 92
organisations. 1 21 92

The 1 21 93
truth 1 21 93
is 1 21 93
that 1 21 93
the 1 21 93
Guardian 1 21 93
has 1 21 93
not 1 21 93
erred 1 21 93
in 1 21 93
this 1 21 93
latest 1 21 93
story 1 21 93
attacking 1 21 93
Assange, 1 21 93
or 1 21 93
in 1 21 93
its 1 21 93
much 1 21 93
longer-running 1 21 93
campaign 1 21 93
to 1 21 93
vilify 1 21 93
him. 1 21 93

With 1 21 94
this 1 21 94
story, 1 21 94
it 1 21 94
has 1 21 94
done 1 21 94
what 1 21 94
it 1 21 94
regularly 1 21 94
does 1 21 94
when 1 21 94
supposedly 1 21 94
vital 1 21 94
western 1 21 94
foreign 1 21 94
policy 1 21 94
interests 1 21 94
are 1 21 94
at 1 21 94
stake 1 21 94
– 1 21 94
it 1 21 94
simply 1 21 94
