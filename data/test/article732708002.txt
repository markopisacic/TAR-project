Pope 0 36 0
Francis' 0 36 0
sexual 0 36 0
abuse 0 36 0
commission, 0 36 0
hit 0 36 0
by 0 36 0
resignations 0 36 0
and 0 36 0
criticism, 0 36 0
gets 0 36 0
a 0 36 0
reboot 0 36 0

Last 0 36 1
week 0 36 1
Pope 0 36 1
Francis 0 36 1
announced 0 36 1
he 0 36 1
was 0 36 1
reviving 0 36 1
a 0 36 1
panel 0 36 1
he 0 36 1
created 0 36 1
to 0 36 1
advise 0 36 1
the 0 36 1
Vatican 0 36 1
on 0 36 1
how 0 36 1
to 0 36 1
handle 0 36 1
sexual 0 36 1
abuse 0 36 1
by 0 36 1
clergy. 0 36 1

The 0 36 2
issue 0 36 2
has 0 36 2
dogged 0 36 2
the 0 36 2
Roman 0 36 2
Catholic 0 36 2
Church 0 36 2
in 0 36 2
recent 0 36 2
years, 0 36 2
and 0 36 2
critics 0 36 2
have 0 36 2
accused 0 36 2
Francis 0 36 2
and 0 36 2
his 0 36 2
two 0 36 2
predecessors, 0 36 2
John 0 36 2
Paul 0 36 2
II 0 36 2
and 0 36 2
Benedict 0 36 2
XVI, 0 36 2
of 0 36 2
failing 0 36 2
to 0 36 2
aggressively 0 36 2
weed 0 36 2
out 0 36 2
and 0 36 2
punish 0 36 2
predator 0 36 2
priests. 0 36 2

Here’s 0 36 3
a 0 36 3
look 0 36 3
what 0 36 3
drove 0 36 3
the 0 36 3
panel’s 0 36 3
creation 0 36 3
and 0 36 3
what 0 36 3
to 0 36 3
expect 0 36 3
in 0 36 3
the 0 36 3
future. 0 36 3

What 0 36 4
is 0 36 4
Pope 0 36 4
Francis’ 0 36 4
commission 0 36 4
on 0 36 4
sexual 0 36 4
abuse? 0 36 4

Following 0 36 5
criticism 0 36 5
he 0 36 5
was 0 36 5
not 0 36 5
focusing 0 36 5
on 0 36 5
halting 0 36 5
child 0 36 5
abuse 0 36 5
within 0 36 5
the 0 36 5
church, 0 36 5
Francis 0 36 5
created 0 36 5
the 0 36 5
Pontifical 0 36 5
Commission 0 36 5
for 0 36 5
the 0 36 5
Protection 0 36 5
of 0 36 5
Minors 0 36 5
in 0 36 5
March 0 36 5
2014, 0 36 5
naming 0 36 5
Cardinal 0 36 5
Sean 0 36 5
O’Malley, 0 36 5
the 0 36 5
archbishop 0 36 5
of 0 36 5
Boston, 0 36 5
to 0 36 5
run 0 36 5
it. 0 36 5

O’Malley 0 36 6
was 0 36 6
not 0 36 6
only 0 36 6
a 0 36 6
member 0 36 6
of 0 36 6
the 0 36 6
pope’s 0 36 6
“G9” 0 36 6
group 0 36 6
of 0 36 6
close 0 36 6
advisors; 0 36 6
he 0 36 6
was 0 36 6
also 0 36 6
the 0 36 6
man 0 36 6
who 0 36 6
sought 0 36 6
to 0 36 6
clean 0 36 6
up 0 36 6
the 0 36 6
abuse 0 36 6
scandal 0 36 6
in 0 36 6
Boston 0 36 6
after 0 36 6
the 0 36 6
departure 0 36 6
of 0 36 6
his 0 36 6
predecessor, 0 36 6
Cardinal 0 36 6
Bernard 0 36 6
Law, 0 36 6
whose 0 36 6
shifting 0 36 6
of 0 36 6
predator 0 36 6
priests 0 36 6
to 0 36 6
new 0 36 6
posts 0 36 6
was 0 36 6
exposed 0 36 6
by 0 36 6
the 0 36 6
Boston 0 36 6
Globe 0 36 6
and 0 36 6
chronicled 0 36 6
in 0 36 6
the 0 36 6
movie 0 36 6
“Spotlight.” 0 36 6

The 0 36 7
revelations 0 36 7
about 0 36 7
Law, 0 36 7
who 0 36 7
died 0 36 7
in 0 36 7
December, 0 36 7
emboldened 0 36 7
abuse 0 36 7
victims 0 36 7
across 0 36 7
the 0 36 7
country 0 36 7
and 0 36 7
world, 0 36 7
who 0 36 7
began 0 36 7
speaking 0 36 7
up 0 36 7
about 0 36 7
the 0 36 7
priests 0 36 7
who 0 36 7
had 0 36 7
molested 0 36 7
them. 0 36 7

When 0 36 8
he 0 36 8
created 0 36 8
the 0 36 8
commission, 0 36 8
Francis 0 36 8
said: 0 36 8
“The 0 36 8
commission’s 0 36 8
specific 0 36 8
task 0 36 8
is 0 36 8
to 0 36 8
propose 0 36 8
to 0 36 8
me 0 36 8
the 0 36 8
most 0 36 8
opportune 0 36 8
initiatives 0 36 8
for 0 36 8
protecting 0 36 8
minors 0 36 8
and 0 36 8
vulnerable 0 36 8
adults, 0 36 8
in 0 36 8
order 0 36 8
that 0 36 8
we 0 36 8
may 0 36 8
do 0 36 8
everything 0 36 8
possible 0 36 8
to 0 36 8
ensure 0 36 8
that 0 36 8
crimes 0 36 8
such 0 36 8
as 0 36 8
those 0 36 8
which 0 36 8
have 0 36 8
occurred 0 36 8
are 0 36 8
no 0 36 8
longer 0 36 8
repeated 0 36 8
in 0 36 8
the 0 36 8
Church.” 0 36 8

Why 0 36 9
is 0 36 9
it 0 36 9
being 0 36 9
renewed 0 36 9
now? 0 36 9

After 0 36 10
the 0 36 10
commission’s 0 36 10
three-year 0 36 10
mandate 0 36 10
expired 0 36 10
in 0 36 10
December, 0 36 10
Francis 0 36 10
relaunched 0 36 10
it 0 36 10
on 0 36 10
Feb. 0 36 10
17 0 36 10
with 0 36 10
some 0 36 10
members 0 36 10
reappointed 0 36 10
and 0 36 10
nine 0 36 10
new 0 36 10
members 0 36 10
added, 0 36 10
some 0 36 10
of 0 36 10
whom 0 36 10
are 0 36 10
victims 0 36 10
of 0 36 10
abuse, 0 36 10
although 0 36 10
the 0 36 10
Vatican 0 36 10
declined 0 36 10
to 0 36 10
say 0 36 10
which, 0 36 10
opting 0 36 10
to 0 36 10
respect 0 36 10
their 0 36 10
privacy. 0 36 10

O’Malley 0 36 11
returns 0 36 11
as 0 36 11
chief. 0 36 11

New 0 36 12
members 0 36 12
come 0 36 12
from 0 36 12
Australia, 0 36 12
Brazil, 0 36 12
Ethiopia, 0 36 12
India, 0 36 12
the 0 36 12
Netherlands 0 36 12
and 0 36 12
Tonga, 0 36 12
"reflecting 0 36 12
the 0 36 12
global 0 36 12
reach 0 36 12
of 0 36 12
the 0 36 12
church 0 36 12
and 0 36 12
the 0 36 12
challenge 0 36 12
of 0 36 12
creating 0 36 12
safeguarding 0 36 12
structures 0 36 12
in 0 36 12
diverse 0 36 12
cultural 0 36 12
context,” 0 36 12
the 0 36 12
Vatican 0 36 12
said. 0 36 12

What 0 36 13
did 0 36 13
the 0 36 13
first 0 36 13
commission 0 36 13
achieve? 0 36 13

The 0 36 14
Vatican 0 36 14
has 0 36 14
said 0 36 14
it 0 36 14
“worked 0 36 14
with 0 36 14
almost 0 36 14
200 0 36 14
dioceses 0 36 14
and 0 36 14
religious 0 36 14
communities 0 36 14
worldwide 0 36 14
to 0 36 14
raise 0 36 14
awareness 0 36 14
and 0 36 14
to 0 36 14
educate 0 36 14
people 0 36 14
on 0 36 14
the 0 36 14
need 0 36 14
for 0 36 14
safeguarding 0 36 14
in 0 36 14
our 0 36 14
homes, 0 36 14
parishes, 0 36 14
schools, 0 36 14
hospitals, 0 36 14
and 0 36 14
other 0 36 14
institutions.” 0 36 14

What 0 36 15
didn’t 0 36 15
it 0 36 15
do? 0 36 15

Commission 0 36 16
members 0 36 16
quickly 0 36 16
realized 0 36 16
they 0 36 16
needed 0 36 16
to 0 36 16
go 0 36 16
beyond 0 36 16
raising 0 36 16
awareness 0 36 16
and 0 36 16
deal 0 36 16
with 0 36 16
the 0 36 16
bishops 0 36 16
who 0 36 16
quietly 0 36 16
shift 0 36 16
offenders 0 36 16
to 0 36 16
new 0 36 16
dioceses 0 36 16
when 0 36 16
they 0 36 16
are 0 36 16
exposed 0 36 16
as 0 36 16
molesters 0 36 16
and 0 36 16
rapists. 0 36 16

Even 0 36 17
if 0 36 17
church 0 36 17
laws 0 36 17
already 0 36 17
existed 0 36 17
to 0 36 17
hold 0 36 17
bishops 0 36 17
accountable 0 36 17
for 0 36 17
their 0 36 17
priests’ 0 36 17
behavior, 0 36 17
those 0 36 17
strictures 0 36 17
were 0 36 17
not 0 36 17
enough, 0 36 17
O’Malley 0 36 17
said 0 36 17
in 0 36 17
2014. 0 36 17

“There 0 36 18
are, 0 36 18
theoretically 0 36 18
I 0 36 18
guess, 0 36 18
canons 0 36 18
that 0 36 18
could 0 36 18
apply 0 36 18
here, 0 36 18
but 0 36 18
obviously 0 36 18
they 0 36 18
have 0 36 18
not 0 36 18
been 0 36 18
sufficient,” 0 36 18
he 0 36 18
said. 0 36 18

The 0 36 19
commission 0 36 19
was 0 36 19
behind 0 36 19
Francis’ 0 36 19
decision 0 36 19
in 0 36 19
2015 0 36 19
to 0 36 19
create 0 36 19
a 0 36 19
new 0 36 19
tribunal 0 36 19
to 0 36 19
judge 0 36 19
bishops 0 36 19
caught 0 36 19
covering 0 36 19
up 0 36 19
for 0 36 19
abusive 1 36 19
priests, 1 36 19
and 0 36 19
to 0 36 19
fund 0 36 19
it 0 36 19
for 0 36 19
five 0 36 19
years. 0 36 19

But 0 36 20
amid 0 36 20
myriad 0 36 20
legal 0 36 20
questions 0 36 20
over 0 36 20
what 0 36 20
exact 0 36 20
powers 0 36 20
the 0 36 20
court 0 36 20
would 0 36 20
have, 0 36 20
it 0 36 20
never 0 36 20
got 0 36 20
off 0 36 20
the 0 36 20
ground. 0 36 20

In 0 36 21
2016, 0 36 21
Francis 0 36 21
officially 0 36 21
killed 0 36 21
the 0 36 21
plan 0 36 21
to 0 36 21
create 0 36 21
it, 0 36 21
issuing 0 36 21
a 0 36 21
document 0 36 21
that 0 36 21
essentially 0 36 21
called 0 36 21
on 0 36 21
using 0 36 21
existing 0 36 21
procedures 0 36 21
to 0 36 21
tackle 0 36 21
the 0 36 21
problem. 0 36 21

Francis 0 36 22
was 0 36 22
also 0 36 22
criticized 0 36 22
when 0 36 22
Australian 0 36 22
Cardinal 0 36 22
George 0 36 22
Pell, 0 36 22
whom 0 36 22
he 0 36 22
had 0 36 22
brought 0 36 22
to 0 36 22
Rome 0 36 22
to 0 36 22
clean 0 36 22
up 0 36 22
Vatican 0 36 22
finances, 0 36 22
was 0 36 22
forced 0 36 22
to 0 36 22
return 0 36 22
to 0 36 22
Australia 0 36 22
last 0 36 22
year 0 36 22
to 0 36 22
face 0 36 22
charges 0 36 22
of 0 36 22
sexual 0 36 22
assault. 0 36 22

Any 0 36 23
other 0 36 23
problems? 0 36 23

Commission 0 36 24
members 0 36 24
said 0 36 24
bishops 0 36 24
should 0 36 24
call 0 36 24
the 0 36 24
police 0 36 24
when 0 36 24
they 0 36 24
discovered 0 36 24
predator 1 36 24
priests, 1 36 24
rather 0 36 24
than 0 36 24
phone 0 36 24
the 0 36 24
nearest 0 36 24
religious 0 36 24
retreat 0 36 24
to 0 36 24
“park” 1 36 24
the 1 36 24
priest 1 36 24
out 1 36 24
of 1 36 24
harm’s 1 36 24
way. 1 36 24

But 0 36 25
this 0 36 25
simple 0 36 25
message 0 36 25
was 0 36 25
hard 0 36 25
to 0 36 25
get 0 36 25
across. 0 36 25

It 0 36 26
emerged 0 36 26
that 0 36 26
during 0 36 26
a 0 36 26
Vatican 0 36 26
training 0 36 26
course 0 36 26
for 0 36 26
new 0 36 26
bishops 0 36 26
in 0 36 26
September 0 36 26
2015 0 36 26
a 0 36 26
French 0 36 26
priest 0 36 26
informed 0 36 26
bishops 0 36 26
they 0 36 26
had 0 36 26
no 0 36 26
obligation 0 36 26
to 0 36 26
report 0 36 26
abuse 0 36 26
to 0 36 26
the 0 36 26
police, 0 36 26
forcing 0 36 26
the 0 36 26
commission 0 36 26
to 0 36 26
issue 0 36 26
a 0 36 26
strong 0 36 26
statement 0 36 26
saying 0 36 26
bishops 0 36 26
had 0 36 26
every 0 36 26
obligation 0 36 26
to 0 36 26
do 0 36 26
so. 0 36 26

Did 0 36 27
commission 0 36 27
members 0 36 27
persevere? 0 36 27

Not 0 36 28
all 0 36 28
of 0 36 28
them. 0 36 28

British 0 36 29
member 0 36 29
Peter 0 36 29
Saunders, 0 36 29
a 0 36 29
former 0 36 29
victim 0 36 29
of 0 36 29
priestly 0 36 29
abuse, 0 36 29
was 0 36 29
ousted 0 36 29
in 0 36 29
2016. 0 36 29

He 0 36 30
said 0 36 30
the 0 36 30
group 0 36 30
was 0 36 30
a 0 36 30
toothless, 1 36 30
paper-shuffling 1 36 30
exercise. 1 36 30

Irish 0 36 31
member 0 36 31
Marie 0 36 31
Collins, 0 36 31
another 0 36 31
victim, 0 36 31
resigned 0 36 31
in 0 36 31
March 0 36 31
last 0 36 31
year 0 36 31
and 0 36 31
said 0 36 31
Vatican 0 36 31
bureaucrats 0 36 31
had 0 36 31
refused 0 36 31
to 0 36 31
comply 0 36 31
with 0 36 31
the 0 36 31
commission’s 0 36 31
request 0 36 31
— 0 36 31
approved 0 36 31
by 0 36 31
the 0 36 31
pope 0 36 31
— 0 36 31
to 0 36 31
respond 0 36 31
to 0 36 31
all 0 36 31
letters 0 36 31
sent 0 36 31
to 0 36 31
the 0 36 31
Vatican 0 36 31
by 0 36 31
abuse 0 36 31
victims. 0 36 31

Marie 0 36 32
Collins, 0 36 32
then 0 36 32
a 0 36 32
member 0 36 32
of 0 36 32
the 0 36 32
pope's 0 36 32
sex 0 36 32
abuse 0 36 32
commission, 0 36 32
in 0 36 32
2015 0 36 32
hands 0 36 32
a 0 36 32
letter 0 36 32

by 0 36 32

Was 0 36 34
the 0 36 34
pope 0 36 34
listening 0 36 34
to 0 36 34
the 0 36 34
commission? 0 36 34

Possibly 0 36 35
not. 0 36 35

In 0 36 36
2015, 0 36 36
Collins 0 36 36
handed 0 36 36
O’Malley 0 36 36
a 0 36 36
letter 0 36 36
addressed 0 36 36
to 0 36 36
the 0 36 36
pope 0 36 36
from 0 36 36
Juan 0 36 36
Carlos 0 36 36
Cruz, 0 36 36
a 0 36 36
Chilean 0 36 36
abused 0 36 36
as 0 36 36
a 0 36 36
boy 0 36 36
by 0 36 36
Chilean 0 36 36
prelate 0 36 36
Fernando 0 36 36
Karadima, 0 36 36
who 0 36 36
was 0 36 36
sentenced 0 36 36
by 0 36 36
the 0 36 36
Vatican 0 36 36
to 0 36 36
a 0 36 36
lifetime 0 36 36
of 0 36 36
penance 0 36 36
in 0 36 36
2010. 0 36 36

Cruz 0 36 37
described 0 36 37
how 0 36 37
the 0 36 37
abuse 0 36 37
was 0 36 37
witnessed 0 36 37
and 0 36 37
covered 0 36 37
up 0 36 37
by 0 36 37
Juan 0 36 37
Barros, 0 36 37
a 0 36 37
priest 0 36 37
whose 0 36 37
appointment 0 36 37
as 0 36 37
a 0 36 37
bishop 0 36 37
in 0 36 37
2015 0 36 37
prompted 0 36 37
huge 0 36 37
protests 0 36 37
in 0 36 37
Chile. 0 36 37

The 0 36 38
pope 0 36 38
has 0 36 38
stuck 0 36 38
by 0 36 38
Barros, 0 36 38
dismissing 0 36 38
the 0 36 38
protesters 0 36 38
as 0 36 38
“lefties” 1 36 38
and 0 36 38
hugging 0 36 38
Barros 0 36 38
publicly 0 36 38
during 0 36 38
his 0 36 38
visit 0 36 38
to 0 36 38
Chile 0 36 38
last 0 36 38
month. 0 36 38

"I 0 36 39
can't 0 36 39
condemn 0 36 39
[Barros] 0 36 39
because 0 36 39
I 0 36 39
don't 0 36 39
have 0 36 39
evidence," 0 36 39
he 0 36 39
said 0 36 39
on 0 36 39
the 0 36 39
plane 0 36 39
back 0 36 39
to 0 36 39
Rome, 0 36 39
suggesting 0 36 39
he 0 36 39
had 0 36 39
ignored 0 36 39
or 0 36 39
never 0 36 39
read 0 36 39
the 0 36 39
letter 0 36 39
from 0 36 39
Cruz. 0 36 39

That 0 36 40
was 0 36 40
too 0 36 40
much 0 36 40
for 0 36 40
O’Malley, 0 36 40
who 0 36 40
said 0 36 40
Francis 0 36 40
had 1 36 40
caused 1 36 40
"great 1 36 40
pain” 1 36 40
to 1 36 40
victims. 1 36 40

If 1 36 41
Francis 1 36 41
was 1 36 41
not 1 36 41
listening 1 36 41
to 1 36 41
the 1 36 41
commission 1 36 41
about 1 36 41
Barros, 1 36 41
whom 1 36 41
was 1 36 41
he 1 36 41
listening 1 36 41
to? 1 36 41

Vatican 0 36 42
watchers 0 36 42
believe 0 36 42
the 0 36 42
pope 0 36 42
was 0 36 42
influenced 0 36 42
by 0 36 42
Chilean 0 36 42
Cardinal 0 36 42
Francisco 0 36 42
Javier 0 36 42
Errazuriz, 0 36 42
a 0 36 42
member 0 36 42
of 0 36 42
the 0 36 42
G9 0 36 42
group 0 36 42
who 0 36 42
has 0 36 42
backed 0 36 42
Barros 0 36 42
and 0 36 42
reportedly 0 36 42
helped 0 36 42
block 0 36 42
moves 0 36 42
to 0 36 42
make 0 36 42
Cruz 0 36 42
a 0 36 42
member 0 36 42
of 0 36 42
the 0 36 42
abuse 0 36 42
commission. 0 36 42

So 0 36 43
is 0 36 43
the 0 36 43
pope 0 36 43
intransigent 0 36 43
on 0 36 43
Barros? 0 36 43

No. 0 36 44

Something 0 36 45
changed 0 36 45
his 0 36 45
mind 0 36 45
after 0 36 45
his 0 36 45
Chilean 0 36 45
trip, 0 36 45
possibly 0 36 45
the 0 36 45
scale 0 36 45
of 0 36 45
the 0 36 45
protest 0 36 45
against 0 36 45
Barros 0 36 45
in 0 36 45
the 0 36 45
country. 0 36 45

On 0 36 46
Feb. 0 36 46
17, 0 36 46
he 0 36 46
sent 0 36 46
a 0 36 46
senior 0 36 46
Vatican 0 36 46
sex 0 36 46
abuse 0 36 46
investigator, 0 36 46
Archbishop 0 36 46
Charles 0 36 46
Scicluna, 0 36 46
to 0 36 46
New 0 36 46
York 0 36 46
to 0 36 46
interview 0 36 46
Cruz, 0 36 46
who 0 36 46
now 0 36 46
lives 0 36 46
in 0 36 46
Philadelphia. 0 36 46

"For 0 36 47
the 0 36 47
first 0 36 47
time 0 36 47
I 0 36 47
felt 0 36 47
that 0 36 47
someone 0 36 47
is 0 36 47
listening," 0 36 47
Cruz 0 36 47
said 0 36 47
after 0 36 47
the 0 36 47
meeting. 0 36 47

What 0 36 48
happens 0 36 48
next? 0 36 48

“This 0 36 49
should 0 36 49
lead 0 36 49
to 0 36 49
Barros 0 36 49
stepping 0 36 49
down,” 0 36 49
said 0 36 49
Saunders, 0 36 49
who 0 36 49
is 0 36 49
forming 0 36 49
his 0 36 49
own 0 36 49
campaign 0 36 49
group 0 36 49
with 0 36 49
Cruz 0 36 49
and 0 36 49
others 0 36 49
to 0 36 49
fight 0 36 49
clerical 0 36 49
abuse. 0 36 49

The 0 36 50
new 0 36 50
papal 0 36 50
commission 0 36 50
will 0 36 50
meanwhile 0 36 50
hold 0 36 50
its 0 36 50
first 0 36 50
meeting 0 36 50
in 0 36 50
April. 0 36 50
