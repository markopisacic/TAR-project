its 0 360 1

begins 0 360 1
Monday, 0 360 1
October 0 360 1
1. 0 360 1

Democrats 0 360 2
had 0 360 2
Kavanaugh 0 360 2
accuser 0 360 2
Christine 0 360 2
Blasey 0 360 2
Ford’s 0 360 2
never-credible 1 360 2
accusations 1 360 2
of 1 360 2
sexual 1 360 2
abuse 1 360 2
-- 0 360 2
including 0 360 2
possible 0 360 2
attempted 0 360 2
rape 0 360 2
-- 0 360 2
in 0 360 2
hand 0 360 2
way 0 360 2
back 0 360 2
in 0 360 2
the 0 360 2
summer. 0 360 2

They 1 360 3
deliberately 1 360 3
refused 1 360 3
to 1 360 3
bring 1 360 3
up 1 360 3
the 1 360 3
allegations, 1 360 3
as 1 360 3
weak 1 360 3
and 1 360 3
ridiculous 1 360 3
as 1 360 3
they 1 360 3
are, 1 360 3
at 1 360 3
Kavanaugh’s 1 360 3
Senate 1 360 3
confirmation 1 360 3
hearings 1 360 3
because 1 360 3
they 1 360 3
didn’t 1 360 3
want 1 360 3
to 1 360 3
have 1 360 3
a 1 360 3
rational 1 360 3
discussion. 1 360 3

They 0 360 4
wanted 0 360 4
to 0 360 4
hurl 1 360 4
the 1 360 4
wild 1 360 4
claims 1 360 4
like 1 360 4
a 1 360 4
grenade 1 360 4
at 0 360 4
the 0 360 4
last 0 360 4
minute 0 360 4
to 0 360 4
blow 0 360 4
up 0 360 4
the 0 360 4
process. 0 360 4

And 0 360 5
so 0 360 5
far 0 360 5
it 0 360 5
appears 0 360 5
they’re 0 360 5
succeeding. 0 360 5

If 0 360 6
Kavanaugh 0 360 6
isn’t 0 360 6
in 0 360 6
place 0 360 6
a 0 360 6
week 0 360 6
from 0 360 6
Monday, 0 360 6
the 0 360 6
Supreme 0 360 6
Court 0 360 6
will 0 360 6
begin 0 360 6
hearing 0 360 6
cases 0 360 6
in 0 360 6
its 0 360 6
new 0 360 6
term 0 360 6
shorthanded. 0 360 6

The 0 360 7
high 0 360 7
court 0 360 7
normally 0 360 7
has 0 360 7
a 0 360 7
complement 0 360 7
of 0 360 7
nine 0 360 7
justices 0 360 7
but 0 360 7
with 0 360 7
Associate 0 360 7
Justice 0 360 7
Anthony 0 360 7
Kennedy’s 0 360 7
retirement 0 360 7
July 0 360 7
31, 0 360 7
which 0 360 7
cleared 0 360 7
the 0 360 7
way 0 360 7
for 0 360 7
Kavanaugh’s 0 360 7
nomination, 0 360 7
there 0 360 7
have 0 360 7
only 0 360 7
been 0 360 7
eight 0 360 7
justices 0 360 7
in 0 360 7
place. 0 360 7

Roughly 0 360 8
speaking 0 360 8
there 0 360 8
is 0 360 8
a 0 360 8
4-to-4 0 360 8
liberal 0 360 8
to 0 360 8
conservative 0 360 8
ideological 0 360 8
split 0 360 8
on 0 360 8
the 0 360 8
court. 0 360 8

Democrats 0 360 9
would 0 360 9
prefer 0 360 9
to 0 360 9
drag 0 360 9
the 0 360 9
confirmation 0 360 9
process 0 360 9
into 0 360 9
the 0 360 9
next 0 360 9
Congress 0 360 9
where 0 360 9
they 0 360 9
hope 0 360 9
to 0 360 9
take 0 360 9
control 0 360 9
from 0 360 9
Republicans. 0 360 9

Election 0 360 10
Day 0 360 10
is 0 360 10
November 0 360 10
6. 0 360 10

The 0 360 11
GOP 0 360 11
currently 0 360 11
controls 0 360 11
the 0 360 11
Senate, 0 360 11
which 0 360 11
has 0 360 11
the 0 360 11
final 0 360 11
say 0 360 11
on 0 360 11
judicial 0 360 11
nominations, 0 360 11
by 0 360 11
an 0 360 11
uncomfortably 0 360 11
close 0 360 11
margin 0 360 11
of 0 360 11
51 0 360 11
to 0 360 11
49. 0 360 11

Christine 0 360 12
Blasey 0 360 12
Ford’s 0 360 12
lawyers 0 360 12
are 0 360 12
trying 0 360 12
to 0 360 12
game 0 360 12
the 0 360 12
system. 0 360 12

They 0 360 13
know 0 360 13
that 0 360 13
Senate 0 360 13
Judiciary 0 360 13
Committee 0 360 13
rules 0 360 13
require 0 360 13
Chairman 0 360 13
Chuck 0 360 13
Grassley 0 360 13
(R-Iowa) 0 360 13
to 0 360 13
provide 0 360 13
a 0 360 13
full 0 360 13
week’s 0 360 13
notice 0 360 13
for 0 360 13
a 0 360 13
hearing. 0 360 13

So, 0 360 14
if, 0 360 14
for 0 360 14
example, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
committee 0 360 14
followed 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
rules 0 360 14
and 0 360 14
agreed 0 360 14
Friday 0 360 14
(today) 0 360 14
to 0 360 14
a 0 360 14
hearing, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
soonest 0 360 14
it 0 360 14
could 0 360 14
be 0 360 14
held 0 360 14
would 0 360 14
be 0 360 14
next 0 360 14
Friday, 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
final 0 360 14
business 0 360 14
day 0 360 14
before 0 360 14
the 0 360 14
Supreme 0 360 14
Court’s 0 360 14
new 0 360 14
term 0 360 14
begins. 0 360 14

Of 0 360 15
course, 0 360 15
lawyers 1 360 15
are 1 360 15
masters 1 360 15
of 1 360 15
delay, 1 360 15
and 0 360 15
social 1 360 15
justice 1 360 15
warrior-lawyers 1 360 15
hoping 1 360 15
to 1 360 15
torpedo 1 360 15
President 1 360 15
Trump’s 1 360 15
agenda 1 360 15
have 0 360 15
an 0 360 15
added 0 360 15
incentive 0 360 15
to 0 360 15
drag 0 360 15
the 0 360 15
confirmation 0 360 15
process 0 360 15
out 0 360 15
as 0 360 15
long 0 360 15
as 0 360 15
possible. 0 360 15

New 0 360 16
demands 0 360 16
and 0 360 16
fake 0 360 16
emergencies 0 360 16
are 0 360 16
bound 0 360 16
to 0 360 16
arise 0 360 16
from 0 360 16
Ford’s 0 360 16
legal 0 360 16
team. 0 360 16

It 0 360 17
was 0 360 17
unclear 0 360 17
at 0 360 17
press 0 360 17
time 0 360 17
if 0 360 17
the 0 360 17
public 0 360 17
hearing 0 360 17
scheduled 0 360 17
for 0 360 17
Monday 0 360 17
into 0 360 17
the 0 360 17
allegations 0 360 17
of 0 360 17
sexual 0 360 17
misconduct 0 360 17
against 0 360 17
Kavanaugh 0 360 17
would 0 360 17
go 0 360 17
forward. 0 360 17

Kavanaugh 0 360 18
informed 0 360 18
the 0 360 18
committee 0 360 18
he 0 360 18
was 0 360 18
willing 0 360 18
to 0 360 18
testify 0 360 18
Monday. 0 360 18

“I 0 360 19
continue 0 360 19
to 0 360 19
want 0 360 19
a 0 360 19
hearing 0 360 19
as 0 360 19
soon 0 360 19
as 0 360 19
possible, 0 360 19
so 0 360 19
that 0 360 19
I 0 360 19
can 0 360 19
clear 0 360 19
my 0 360 19
name," 0 360 19
he 0 360 19
wrote 0 360 19
in 0 360 19
a 0 360 19
letter. 0 360 19

Ford's 0 360 20
lawyer 0 360 20
Debra 0 360 20
Katz 0 360 20
told 0 360 20
the 0 360 20
Judiciary 0 360 20
Committee 0 360 20
her 0 360 20
client 0 360 20
"wishes 0 360 20
to 0 360 20
testify, 0 360 20
provided 0 360 20
that 0 360 20
we 0 360 20
can 0 360 20
agree 0 360 20
on 0 360 20
terms 0 360 20
that 0 360 20
are 0 360 20
fair 0 360 20
and 0 360 20
which 0 360 20
ensure 0 360 20
her 0 360 20
safety." 0 360 20

Another 0 360 21
Ford 0 360 21
attorney 0 360 21
reportedly 0 360 21
said 0 360 21
Wednesday 0 360 21
that 0 360 21
there 0 360 21
are 0 360 21
“multiple 0 360 21
witnesses” 0 360 21
who 0 360 21
need 0 360 21
to 0 360 21
testify. 0 360 21

"A 0 360 22
hearing 0 360 22
on 0 360 22
Monday 0 360 22
is 0 360 22
not 0 360 22
possible 0 360 22
and 0 360 22
the 0 360 22
Committee's 0 360 22
insistence 0 360 22
that 0 360 22
it 0 360 22
occur 0 360 22
then 0 360 22
is 0 360 22
arbitrary 0 360 22
in 0 360 22
any 0 360 22
event,” 0 360 22
Katz 0 360 22
wrote 0 360 22
in 0 360 22
a 0 360 22
letter. 0 360 22

“Dr. 0 360 23

Ford 0 360 24
has 0 360 24
asked 0 360 24
me 0 360 24

you 0 360 24

various 0 360 24
options 0 360 24
you 0 360 24

Her 0 360 25
strong 0 360 25

GOP 0 360 26
lawmakers 0 360 26
are 0 360 26
figuring 0 360 26
out 0 360 26
how 0 360 26
to 0 360 26

to 0 360 26
Ford’s 0 360 26

Charles 0 360 27
E. 0 360 27
Grassley 0 360 27
(R-Iowa), 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
Judiciary 0 360 27
Committee 0 360 27
chairman, 0 360 27
said 0 360 27
that 0 360 27
his 0 360 27
staff 0 360 27
had 0 360 27
discussed 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
issue 0 360 27
with 0 360 27
Ford’s 0 360 27
attorney 0 360 27
earlier 0 360 27
in 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
day 0 360 27
and 0 360 27
that 0 360 27
he 0 360 27
would 0 360 27
consult 0 360 27
with 0 360 27
his 0 360 27

about 0 360 27
the 0 360 27
next 0 360 27
move. 0 360 27

Ford’s 0 360 28
offer 0 360 28
also 0 360 28
increased 0 360 28
the 0 360 28
pressure 0 360 28
on 0 360 28
several 0 360 28
key 0 360 28
moderates 0 360 28

Alaska 0 360 29

whose 0 360 29
votes 0 360 29
will 0 360 29
probably 0 360 29
be 0 360 29

put 0 360 29
Kavanaugh 0 360 29
on 0 360 29
the 0 360 29

court. 0 360 29

Both 0 360 30
were 0 360 30
already 0 360 30
facing 0 360 30
heavy 0 360 30
pressure 0 360 30
from 0 360 30
abortion 0 360 30
rights 0 360 30
groups 0 360 30
concerned 0 360 30
that 0 360 30
Kavanaugh, 0 360 30
a 1 360 30

conservative 1 360 30
and 0 360 30
longtime 0 360 30

might 0 360 30
vote 0 360 30
to 0 360 30
restrict 0 360 30
access 0 360 30

The 0 360 31
sexual 0 360 31

allegation, 0 360 31
which 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
nominee 0 360 31
has 0 360 31
denied, 0 360 31
has 0 360 31
upended 0 360 31
his 0 360 31
seemingly 0 360 31
sure-bet 0 360 31
confirmation 0 360 31
and 0 360 31
only 0 360 31
increased 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
stakes 0 360 31
for 0 360 31
the 0 360 31
key 0 360 31
lawmakers. 0 360 31

Chairman 0 360 32
Grassley 0 360 32
had 0 360 32
imposed 0 360 32
a 0 360 32
Thursday 0 360 32
deadline 0 360 32
for 0 360 32

Ford’s 0 360 33
demand. 0 360 33

The 0 360 34
demand 0 360 34
for 0 360 34
an 0 360 34
FBI 0 360 34
probe 0 360 34
is 0 360 34
“utter 1 360 34
nonsense,” 1 360 34
former 0 360 34
U.S. 0 360 34
Attorney 0 360 34
Joseph 0 360 34
diGenova 0 360 34
said 0 360 34
earlier 0 360 34
this 0 360 34
week. 0 360 34

Ford 0 360 35
“really 0 360 35
doesn’t 0 360 35
want 0 360 35
to 0 360 35
testify,” 0 360 35
he 0 360 35
said. 0 360 35

“Because 0 360 36
when 0 360 36
she 0 360 36
does, 0 360 36
she 1 360 36
is 1 360 36
going 1 360 36
to 1 360 36
look 1 360 36
like 1 360 36
the 1 360 36
loon 1 360 36
she 1 360 36
is. 1 360 36

She 0 360 37
may 0 360 37
very 0 360 37
well 0 360 37
believe 0 360 37
everything 0 360 37
she’s 0 360 37
saying, 0 360 37
and 0 360 37
that 0 360 37
is 0 360 37
one 0 360 37
of 0 360 37
the 0 360 37
signs 0 360 37
of 0 360 37
lunacy, 0 360 37
believing 0 360 37
something 0 360 37
that 0 360 37
isn’t 0 360 37
real.” 0 360 37
And 0 360 37
her 1 360 37
lawyer 1 360 37
is 1 360 37
“even 1 360 37
loonier.” 1 360 37

Besides, 0 360 38
diGenova 0 360 38
explained, 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
eleventh-hour 0 360 38
sexual 0 360 38
abuse 0 360 38
claim 0 360 38
leveled 0 360 38
against 0 360 38
Kavanaugh 0 360 38
is 0 360 38
a 0 360 38
non-federal 0 360 38
matter 0 360 38
and 0 360 38
in 0 360 38
this 0 360 38
case 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
alleged 0 360 38
assault 0 360 38
hasn’t 0 360 38
even 0 360 38
been 0 360 38
clearly 0 360 38
outlined 0 360 38
by 0 360 38
the 0 360 38
alleged 0 360 38
victim. 0 360 38

Ford 0 360 39
didn’t 0 360 39
report 0 360 39
it 0 360 39
to 0 360 39
anyone 0 360 39
for 0 360 39
decades 0 360 39
and 0 360 39
isn’t 0 360 39
even 0 360 39
certain 0 360 39
when 0 360 39
or 0 360 39
where 0 360 39
it 0 360 39
happened, 0 360 39
so 0 360 39
the 0 360 39
FBI 0 360 39
can’t 0 360 39
investigate 0 360 39
the 0 360 39
matter 0 360 39
“because 0 360 39
there 0 360 39
is 0 360 39
nothing 0 360 39
to 0 360 39
investigate.” 0 360 39

Kavanaugh 0 360 40
has 0 360 40
already 0 360 40
undergone 0 360 40
six 0 360 40
FBI 0 360 40
background 0 360 40
checks 0 360 40
and 0 360 40
the 0 360 40
agency 0 360 40
has 0 360 40
ruled 0 360 40
out 0 360 40
investigating 0 360 40
Ford’s 0 360 40
allegation 0 360 40
of 0 360 40
drunken 0 360 40
groping 0 360 40
at 0 360 40
a 0 360 40
teenagers’ 0 360 40
party 0 360 40
36 0 360 40

Ford’s 1 360 41
request 1 360 41
for 1 360 41
an 1 360 41
FBI 1 360 41
probe 1 360 41
is 1 360 41
“clearly 1 360 41
a 1 360 41
desire 1 360 41
to 1 360 41
delay 1 360 41
proceedings,” 1 360 41
diGenova 0 360 41
said. 0 360 41

President 0 360 42

is 0 360 42
taking 0 360 42
the 0 360 42
high 0 360 42
road 0 360 42
and 0 360 42
is 0 360 42
avoiding 0 360 42
attacking 0 360 42
Ford, 0 360 42
which 0 360 42
isn’t 0 360 42
a 0 360 42
risky 0 360 42
move 0 360 42
given 0 360 42
how 0 360 42
obviously 1 360 42
unbalanced 1 360 42
the 1 360 42
accuser 1 360 42
is. 1 360 42

Ford 0 360 43
is 0 360 43
already 0 360 43
doing 0 360 43
an 1 360 43
excellent 1 360 43
job 1 360 43
destroying 1 360 43
herself 1 360 43
without 0 360 43
Republican 0 360 43
assistance. 0 360 43

At 0 360 44

House 0 360 44
on 0 360 44
Wednesday, 0 360 44
President 0 360 44
Trump 0 360 44
said 0 360 44
it 0 360 44
would 0 360 44
be 0 360 44
"wonderful" 0 360 44
if 0 360 44
Ford 0 360 44
testifies 0 360 44
and 0 360 44
"unfortunate" 0 360 44
if 0 360 44
she 0 360 44
does 0 360 44
not. 0 360 44

He 0 360 45
indicated 0 360 45
he 0 360 45
was 0 360 45
keeping 0 360 45
an 0 360 45
open 0 360 45
mind 0 360 45
about 0 360 45
the 0 360 45
allegations 0 360 45
but 0 360 45
that 0 360 45
it 0 360 45
was 0 360 45
"very 0 360 45
hard 0 360 45
for 0 360 45
me 0 360 45
to 0 360 45

between 0 360 45
her 0 360 45
and 0 360 45
the 0 360 45
nominee. 0 360 45

"I 0 360 46
think 1 360 46
he's 1 360 46
an 1 360 46
extraordinary 1 360 46
man 1 360 46
– 1 360 46
I 1 360 46
think 1 360 46
he's 1 360 46
a 1 360 46
man 1 360 46

I've 1 360 46
been 1 360 46
telling 1 360 46
you, 1 360 46

he 1 360 46
has 1 360 46
an 1 360 46
unblemished 1 360 46
record," 1 360 46
Trump 0 360 46
said. 0 360 46

"This 0 360 47
is 0 360 47
a 0 360 47
very 0 360 47
tough 0 360 47
thing 0 360 47
for 0 360 47
him 0 360 47
and 0 360 47
his 0 360 47

we 0 360 47

over 0 360 47
it 0 360 47
