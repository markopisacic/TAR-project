Somewhere 0
in 0
the 0
“community 0
standards” 0
that 0
Facebook 0
demands 0
everyone 0
follow 0
is 1
a 1
real 1
doozy. 1

The 0
social-media 0
company 0
has 0
told 0
author 0
and 0
commentator 0
Jamie 0
Glazov 0
that 0
their 0
standards 0
forbid 0
his 0
article 0
about 0
how 0
to 0
prevent 0
jihadi 1
attacks 1
on 0
Americans. 0

It’s 0
all 0
about 0
Glazov’s 0
new 0
book, 0
“Jihadist 1
Psychopath: 1
How 0
He 0
Is 0
Charming, 1
Seducing, 1
and 1
Devouring 1
Us.” 1

At 0
FrontPage 0
Magazine, 0
where 0
he 0
is 0
editor, 0
he 0
had 0
posted 0
“9 0
Steps 0
to 0
Successfully 0
Counter 0
Jihad,” 0
which 0
included 0
recommendations 0
such 0
as 0
“Label 0
the 0
enemy 0
and 0
make 0
a 0
threat 0
assessment” 0
and 0
“Stop 0
‘partnering’ 0
with 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
front 0
groups.” 0

That 0
apparently 0
was 0
too 0
much 0
for 0
Facebook, 0
which 0
declared 0
“only 0
you 0
can 0
see 0
this 0
post” 0
because 0
it 0
“goes 0
against 0
our 0
Community 0
Standards.” 0

He 0
was 0
suspended 0
from 0
Facebook 0
for 0
30 0
days 0
on 0
Sept. 0
11, 0
the 0
anniversary 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 1
jihadist 1
attack 1
on 0
America 0
that 0
killed 0
nearly 0
3,000. 0

Glazov 0
told 0
Breitbart, 0
“This 0
is 0
really 0
getting 1
surreal 1
in 1
the 1
creepiest 1
and 1
most 1
harrowing 1
Stalinist 1
sense.” 1

reported: 0

Facebook’s 0
Unholy 1
Alliance 1
masters 1
are, 0
without 0
doubt, 0
accelerating 0
their 0
totalitarian 1
suffocation 1
of 1
free 1
thought 1
and 1
expression. 1

It 0
is 0
no 0
surprise, 0
therefore, 0
that 0
Frontpage’s 0
editor, 0
and 0
host 0
of 0
‘The 0
Glazov 0
Gang,’ 0
was 0
suspended 0
from 0
Facebook 0
for 0
30 0
days 0
yesterday, 0
on 0
September 0
11, 0
after 0
posting 0
his 0
article, 0
‘9 0
Steps 0
to 0
Successfully 0
Counter 0
Jihad.’ 0
Glazov 0
believed 0
that 0
the 0
article 0
was 0
more 0
relevant 0
and 0
urgent 0
than 0
ever 0
due 0
to 0
the 1
skyrocketing 1
jihadist 1
stabbings 1
in 1
Europe 1
— 0
and 0
to 0
the 0
17th 0
anniversary 0
of 0
9/11 0
that 0
was 0
approaching 0
the 0
next 0
day. 0

The 0
report 0
said 0
it 0
appears 0
“that 1
daring 1
to 1
give 1
suggestions 1
on 1
how 1
our 1
civilization 1
can 1
stop 1
jihadist 1
attacks 1
and 1
another 1
9/11 1
is 1
against 1
Facebook’s 1
‘community 1
standards. 1

'” 0

“Glazov’s 0
advice 0
also 0
involves 0
the 0
promotion 0
of 0
supporting 0
moderate 1
Muslims 1
– 0
a 1
move 1
that 1
is, 1
clearly, 1
horrifying 1
to 1
Facebook’s 1
masters 1
and 1
therefore 1
also 1
violates 1
their 1
‘community 1
standards,'” 1
the 0
report 0
said. 0

No 0
doubt, 0
Glazov’s 0
consistent 0
campaigning 0
on 0
behalf 0
of 0
Muslim 0
women 0
and 0
girls 0
in 0
his 0
efforts 0
to 0
protect 0
them 0
from 0
FGM, 0
honor 1
killings 1
and 1
other 1
Shariah 1
barbarities, 1
has 0
gained 0
him 0
the 1
anger 1
and 1
hatred 1
of 0
Facebook’s 1
guardians 1
— 0
who 1
are 1
clearly 1
on 1
the 1
side 1
of 1
the 1
Shariah 1
enforcers 1
and 1
oppressors 1
of 1
Muslim 1
women 1
and 1
girls. 1

The 0
report 0
recalls 0
that 0
Facebook 0
censored 0
Glazov 0
in 0
April 0
for 0
posting 0
screenshots 0
of 0
a 0
Muslim’s 0
threat 0
to 0
him. 0

Twitter 0
also 0
lashed 1
out 1
at 0
him 0
for 0
quoting 0
directly 0
from 0
Islamic 0
religious 0
texts, 0
citing 0
its 0
anti-“hate” 1
policies. 1

It 0
is 0
‘hateful 1
conduct,’ 1
apparently, 0
to 0
reference 0
what 0
Islamic 0
texts 0
themselves 0
say. 0

Indeed, 0
Frontpage’s 0
editor 0
had 0
simply 0
referred 0
to 0
Sahih 0
Bukhari’s 0
texts 0
discussing 0
Mohammed’s 0
marriage 0
to 0
Aisha 0
when 0
she 0
was 0
six 0
years 0
old 0
(7.62.88) 0
and 0
to 0
Quranic 0
Suras 0
that 0
mandate 0
the 0
Hijab 0
for 0
women 0
(24:31; 0
33:59) 0
and 0
sanction 0
sexual 0
slavery 0
(4:3; 0
33:50). 0

Facebook 0
also 0
refused 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
Glazov’s 0
inquiry 0
about 0
“what 0
it 0
is 0
specifically 0
that 0
violates 0
Facebook’s 0
‘community 0
standards’ 0
when 0
a 0
person 0
gives 0
advice 0
on 0
how 1
to 1
best 1
defend 1
American 1
lives 1
from 1
jihad.” 1

Glazov 0
has 0
written 0
about 0
the 0
subject 0
in 0
previous 0
books, 0
including 0
“High 0
Noon 0
for 0
America: 0
The 0
Coming 0
Showdown” 0
and 0
“United 0
in 0
Hate.” 0

In 0
his 0
“9 0
Steps” 0
article, 0
he 0
points 0
out 0
that 0
the 0
Obama 0
administration 0
was 0
“cooperating 0
with, 0
and 0
listening 0
to, 0
Muslim 0
Brotherhood 0
front 0
groups 0
such 0
as 0
CAIR 0
and 0
ISNA.” 0

The 1
government 1
needs, 1
he 1
said, 1
to 1
“implement 1
a 1
concrete 1
‘countering-jihad’ 1
strategy.” 1

And 1
he 1
said 1
it 1
needs 1
to 1
affirm 1
“Shariah’s 1
assault 1
on 1
the 1
U.S. 1
Constitution 1
as 1
seditious.” 1

A 0
last 0
key 0
point, 0
the 0
said, 0
is 0
to 0
ridicule 0
the 0
enemy. 0

Ridicule 0
is 0
a 0
vicious 1
and 1
potent 1
weapon. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
baffling 1
and 1
shameful 1
silence 0
in 0
our 0
culture’s 0
sphere 0
of 0
comedy, 0
especially 0
in 0
Hollywood 0
and 0
our 0
media, 0
with 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
myriad 0
ingredients 0
of 0
Shariah 0
and 0
jihad 0
that 1
merit 1
at 1
least 1
a 1
million 1
hilarious 1
satirical 1
sketches. 1

Bill 0
Maher, 0
for 0
whatever 0
unappealing 0
drawbacks 0
he 0
has 0
in 0
conservatives’ 0
eyes, 0
has 0
set 0
a 0
bold 0
standard 0
in 0
this 0
respect 0
in 0
his 0
Burka 0
Fashion 0
Show 0
skit. 0

American 0
comedians 0
need 0
to 0
start 0
writing 0
scripts 0
that 0
follow 0
in 0
Maher’s 0
footsteps 0
and 0
Americans 0
need 0
to 0
encourage 0
and 0
equip 0
them 0
to 0
do 0
so 0
– 0
and 0
to 0
also 0
vigorously 1
defend 1
them 1
from 0
the 0
attacks 0
and 0
slanders 1
they 0
will 0
inevitably 0
receive 0
from 0

forces. 1
