that 0 325 2

not 1 325 2
have 1 325 2
carried 1 325 2
out 1 325 2

Rick, 0 325 3

he 0 325 3
was 0 325 3
Paddock’s 0 325 3

“I 0 325 4
can 1 325 4
tell 1 325 4
you 1 325 4
100% 1 325 4
this 1 325 4
is 1 325 4
not 1 325 4
that 1 325 4
kind 1 325 4
of 1 325 4
guy,” 1 325 4
said 0 325 4
Rick, 0 325 4
adding 0 325 4
that 0 325 4
he 0 325 4
would 0 325 4
see 0 325 4
Paddock 0 325 4
every 0 325 4
other 0 325 4
day 0 325 4
and 0 325 4
that 0 325 4
the 0 325 4
two 0 325 4
would 0 325 4
go 0 325 4
to 0 325 4

“He 0 325 5
never 0 325 5

told 0 325 5
me 0 325 5
that 0 325 5

gun,” 0 325 5
continued 0 325 5
the 0 325 5
shooter’s 0 325 5
neighbor, 0 325 5
adding 0 325 5
that 0 325 5
Paddock 0 325 5
did 0 325 5
not 0 325 5
express 0 325 5
any 0 325 5

“I’m 1 325 6
not 1 325 6
a 1 325 6
big 1 325 6
conspiracy 1 325 6
theory 1 325 6
guy, 1 325 6
but 1 325 6
it 1 325 6
don’t 1 325 6
sit 1 325 6
right,” 1 325 6
said 0 325 6
Rick, 0 325 6
before 0 325 6
making 0 325 6
the 0 325 6
extraordinary 0 325 6
claim 0 325 6
that 0 325 6
the 0 325 6
whole 0 325 6
shooting 0 325 6
was 0 325 6
a 0 325 6
“set 0 325 6
up” 0 325 6
and 0 325 6
that 0 325 6
Paddock’s 1 325 6
body 1 325 6
may 1 325 6
have 1 325 6
been 1 325 6
left 1 325 6
in 1 325 6
the 1 325 6
hotel 1 325 6
room 1 325 6
while 1 325 6
other 1 325 6
assailants 1 325 6
carried 1 325 6
out 1 325 6
the 1 325 6
shooting. 1 325 6

The 0 325 7
caller 0 325 7
mentioned 0 325 7
how 0 325 7
some 0 325 7
people 0 325 7
in 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
crowd 0 325 7
were 0 325 7
warned 0 325 7
45 0 325 7
minutes 0 325 7
before 0 325 7
the 0 325 7
shooting 0 325 7
that 0 325 7
they 0 325 7
were 0 325 7
going 0 325 7
to 0 325 7
die, 0 325 7
suggesting 0 325 7
that 0 325 7
this 0 325 7
was 0 325 7
evidence 0 325 7
of 0 325 7
a 0 325 7
wider 0 325 7
plot 0 325 7
and 0 325 7
not 0 325 7
a 0 325 7
“lone 0 325 7
wolf” 0 325 7
attack. 0 325 7

As 0 325 8
a 0 325 8
firearms 0 325 8
expert, 0 325 8
he 0 325 8
also 0 325 8
questioned 0 325 8
the 0 325 8
lack 0 325 8
of 0 325 8
flashes 0 325 8
coming 0 325 8
from 0 325 8
the 0 325 8
hotel 0 325 8
windows 0 325 8
where 0 325 8
the 0 325 8
shooter 0 325 8
was 0 325 8
supposedly 0 325 8
firing 0 325 8
from. 0 325 8

Rick 0 325 9
said 0 325 9
he 0 325 9
had 0 325 9
already 0 325 9
contacted 0 325 9
the 0 325 9
Clark 0 325 9
County 0 325 9
Sheriff’s 0 325 9
Office 0 325 9
to 0 325 9
relay 0 325 9
all 0 325 9
the 0 325 9
information 0 325 9
he 0 325 9
knew. 0 325 9

Although 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
claims 0 325 10
are 0 325 10
intriguing, 0 325 10
it 0 325 10
is 0 325 10
important 0 325 10
to 0 325 10
remember 0 325 10
that 0 325 10
after 1 325 10
virtually 1 325 10
every 1 325 10
terror 1 325 10
attack 1 325 10
and 1 325 10
mass 1 325 10
shooting, 1 325 10
friends 1 325 10
and 1 325 10
neighbors 1 325 10
express 1 325 10
shock 1 325 10
that 0 325 10
the 0 325 10
culprit 0 325 10
would 0 325 10
be 0 325 10
capable 0 325 10
of 0 325 10
carrying 0 325 10
out 0 325 10
such 0 325 10
horrors, 0 325 10
with 0 325 10
some 0 325 10
outright 0 325 10
denying 0 325 10
it 0 325 10
to 0 325 10
be 0 325 10
possible. 0 325 10

If 0 325 11
Paddock 0 325 11
was 0 325 11
planning 0 325 11
such 0 325 11
a 0 325 11
sophisticated 0 325 11
operation 0 325 11
and 0 325 11
hoping 0 325 11
to 0 325 11
evade 0 325 11
detection, 0 325 11
he 0 325 11
would 0 325 11
not 0 325 11
be 0 325 11
blabbing 0 325 11
details 0 325 11
about 0 325 11
it 0 325 11
to 0 325 11
his 0 325 11
neighbors. 0 325 11

However, 0 325 12
the 0 325 12
neighbor’s 0 325 12
claims 0 325 12
are 0 325 12
certain 0 325 12
to 0 325 12
attract 0 325 12
more 0 325 12
attention 0 325 12
given 0 325 12
that 0 325 12
no 0 325 12
specific 0 325 12
motive 0 325 12
has 0 325 12
yet 0 325 12
to 0 325 12
be 0 325 12
uncovered 0 325 12
for 0 325 12
the 0 325 12
shooting. 0 325 12

What 0 325 13
do 0 325 13
you 0 325 13
think? 0 325 13
