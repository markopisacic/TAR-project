out 1 71 1

The 0 71 2
new 0 71 2
allegations 0 71 2
came 0 71 2
yesterday 0 71 2
amid 0 71 2
reports 0 71 2
that 0 71 2
Senate 0 71 2
Judiciary 0 71 2
Committee 0 71 2
chairman 0 71 2
Chuck 0 71 2
Grassley 0 71 2
(R-Iowa) 0 71 2
tentatively 0 71 2
scheduled 0 71 2
a 0 71 2
hearing 0 71 2
for 0 71 2
this 0 71 2
Thursday 0 71 2
to 0 71 2
take 0 71 2
testimony 0 71 2
from 0 71 2
Christine 0 71 2
Blasey 0 71 2
Ford, 0 71 2

who 0 71 2
claims 0 71 2
Kavanaugh, 0 71 2
53, 0 71 2
sexually 0 71 2
assaulted 0 71 2
her 0 71 2
decades 0 71 2
ago 0 71 2
when 0 71 2
he 0 71 2
was 0 71 2
a 0 71 2
high 0 71 2
school 0 71 2
student. 0 71 2

Suspiciously, 1 71 3
Ford 1 71 3
can’t 1 71 3
–or 1 71 3
won’t— 1 71 3
say 1 71 3
when 1 71 3
or 1 71 3
where 1 71 3
the 1 71 3
alleged 1 71 3
incident 1 71 3
happened 1 71 3
and 1 71 3
can 1 71 3
provide 1 71 3
few 1 71 3
details. 1 71 3

As 0 71 4
Paul 0 71 4
Sperry 0 71 4
writes 0 71 4
at 0 71 4
the 0 71 4
New 0 71 4

Post, 0 71 4
working 0 71 4
with 0 71 4
Sen. 0 71 4

George 0 71 4
Soros’s 0 71 4

Ford’s 0 71 4
lawyers 0 71 4

the 0 71 4
last 0 71 4
few 0 71 4
days 0 71 4
gaming 1 71 4
the 1 71 4
system. 1 71 4

After 0 71 5
stalling 0 71 5
Grassley 0 71 5
and 0 71 5
getting 0 71 5
repeated 0 71 5
extensions, 0 71 5
the 0 71 5
attorneys 0 71 5
got 0 71 5
the 0 71 5
chairman 0 71 5
to 0 71 5
cave 0 71 5
on 0 71 5
various 0 71 5
demands, 0 71 5
such 0 71 5
as 0 71 5
that 0 71 5
Kavanaugh 0 71 5
not 0 71 5
be 0 71 5
in 0 71 5
the 0 71 5
room 0 71 5
when 0 71 5
Ford 0 71 5
gives 0 71 5
evidence. 0 71 5

Republicans 0 71 6
never 0 71 6
seem 0 71 6
to 0 71 6
learn 0 71 6
from 0 71 6
their 0 71 6
mistakes. 0 71 6

As 0 71 7
usual, 0 71 7
Republicans’ 0 71 7
seeming 0 71 7
reasonableness 0 71 7
is 0 71 7
rewarded 0 71 7
with 0 71 7
more 0 71 7
abuse 0 71 7
by 0 71 7
the 0 71 7
Left. 0 71 7

Give 1 71 8
left-wingers 1 71 8
an 1 71 8
inch 1 71 8
and 1 71 8
they’ll 1 71 8
take 1 71 8
a 1 71 8
mile. 1 71 8

Democrats, 0 71 9
it 0 71 9
turns 0 71 9
out, 0 71 9
used 0 71 9
the 0 71 9
extra 0 71 9
time 0 71 9
created 0 71 9
through 0 71 9
their 0 71 9
delaying 0 71 9
tactics 0 71 9
to 0 71 9
produce 0 71 9
two 0 71 9
new 0 71 9
women 0 71 9
with 0 71 9
questionable 0 71 9
claims 0 71 9
against 0 71 9
Kavanaugh. 0 71 9

More 0 71 10
accusers 0 71 10
could 0 71 10
be 0 71 10
on 0 71 10
their 0 71 10
way. 0 71 10

President 0 71 11
Trump 0 71 11
continues 0 71 11
to 0 71 11
support 0 71 11
Kavanaugh, 0 71 11
who 0 71 11
maintains 0 71 11
his 0 71 11
innocence. 0 71 11

“This 0 71 12
alleged 0 71 12
event 0 71 12
from 0 71 12
35 0 71 12
years 0 71 12
ago 0 71 12
did 0 71 12
not 0 71 12
happen,” 0 71 12
the 0 71 12
nominee 0 71 12
said 0 71 12
Sunday 0 71 12
of 0 71 12
Ford’s 0 71 12
accusations. 0 71 12

“The 0 71 13
people 0 71 13
who 0 71 13
knew 0 71 13
me 0 71 13
then 0 71 13
know 0 71 13
that 0 71 13
this 0 71 13
did 0 71 13
not 0 71 13
happen, 0 71 13
and 0 71 13
have 0 71 13
said 0 71 13
so. 0 71 13

This 0 71 14
is 0 71 14
a 0 71 14
smear, 1 71 14
plain 0 71 14
and 0 71 14
simple. 0 71 14

I 0 71 15
look 0 71 15
forward 0 71 15
to 0 71 15
testifying 0 71 15
on 0 71 15
Thursday 0 71 15
about 0 71 15
the 0 71 15
truth, 0 71 15
and 0 71 15
defending 0 71 15
my 0 71 15
good 0 71 15
name 0 71 15
— 0 71 15
and 0 71 15
the 0 71 15
reputation 0 71 15
for 0 71 15
character 0 71 15
and 0 71 15
integrity 0 71 15
I 0 71 15
have 0 71 15
spent 0 71 15
a 0 71 15
lifetime 0 71 15
building 0 71 15
— 0 71 15
against 0 71 15
these 0 71 15
last-minute 0 71 15
allegations.” 0 71 15

If 0 71 16
Kavanaugh 0 71 16
isn’t 0 71 16
on 0 71 16
the 0 71 16
bench 0 71 16
on 0 71 16
October 0 71 16
1, 0 71 16
the 0 71 16
Supreme 0 71 16
Court 0 71 16
will 0 71 16
be 0 71 16
shorthanded 0 71 16
as 0 71 16
it 0 71 16
begins 0 71 16
hearing 0 71 16
cases 0 71 16
in 0 71 16
its 0 71 16
new 0 71 16
term. 0 71 16

The 0 71 17
high 0 71 17
court 0 71 17
normally 0 71 17
has 0 71 17
a 0 71 17
complement 0 71 17
of 0 71 17
nine 0 71 17
justices 0 71 17
but 0 71 17
with 0 71 17
Associate 0 71 17
Justice 0 71 17
Anthony 0 71 17
Kennedy’s 0 71 17
retirement 0 71 17
July 0 71 17
31, 0 71 17
which 0 71 17
cleared 0 71 17
the 0 71 17
way 0 71 17
for 0 71 17
Kavanaugh’s 0 71 17
nomination, 0 71 17
there 0 71 17
have 0 71 17
only 0 71 17
been 0 71 17
only 0 71 17
eight 0 71 17
justices 0 71 17
in 0 71 17
place. 0 71 17

Roughly 0 71 18
speaking 0 71 18
there 0 71 18
is 0 71 18
a 0 71 18
4-to-4 0 71 18
liberal 0 71 18
to 0 71 18
conservative 0 71 18
ideological 0 71 18
split 0 71 18
on 0 71 18
the 0 71 18
court. 0 71 18

Democrats 0 71 19
would 0 71 19
prefer 0 71 19
to 0 71 19
drag 0 71 19
the 0 71 19
confirmation 0 71 19
process 0 71 19
into 0 71 19
the 0 71 19
next 0 71 19
Congress 0 71 19
where 0 71 19
they 0 71 19
stand 0 71 19
a 0 71 19
good 0 71 19
chance 0 71 19
of 0 71 19
taking 0 71 19
control 0 71 19
from 0 71 19
Republicans. 0 71 19

Election 0 71 20
Day 0 71 20
is 0 71 20
November 0 71 20
6. 0 71 20

The 0 71 21
GOP 0 71 21
currently 0 71 21
controls 0 71 21
the 0 71 21
Senate, 0 71 21
which 0 71 21
has 0 71 21
the 0 71 21
final 0 71 21
say 0 71 21
on 0 71 21
judicial 0 71 21
nominations, 0 71 21
by 0 71 21
an 0 71 21
uncomfortably 0 71 21
close 0 71 21
margin 0 71 21
of 0 71 21
51 0 71 21
to 0 71 21
49. 0 71 21

Meanwhile, 0 71 22
the 0 71 22
New 0 71 22
Yorker 0 71 22
magazine 0 71 22
reported 0 71 22
Sunday 0 71 22
that 0 71 22
Deborah 0 71 22
Ramirez, 0 71 22

suddenly 0 71 22
claims 0 71 22
to 0 71 22
have 0 71 22
been 0 71 22
assaulted 0 71 22
by 0 71 22
Kavanaugh 0 71 22
at 0 71 22
a 0 71 22
drunken 0 71 22
party 0 71 22
decades 0 71 22

at 0 71 22
Yale 0 71 22
College. 0 71 22

Ramirez 0 71 23
claims 0 71 23
Kavanaugh 0 71 23
exposed 0 71 23
himself 0 71 23
to 0 71 23
her 0 71 23
and 0 71 23
brushed 0 71 23
his 0 71 23
genitals 0 71 23
against 0 71 23
her. 0 71 23

represents 0 71 24
porn 0 71 24
star 0 71 24
Stormy 0 71 24
Daniels, 0 71 24
tweeted 0 71 24
that 0 71 24
he 0 71 24
represents 0 71 24
another 0 71 24
woman 0 71 24
who 0 71 24
plans 0 71 24
to 0 71 24
accuse 0 71 24
Kavanaugh 0 71 24
of 0 71 24
something. 0 71 24

“I 0 71 25

and 0 71 25
Mark 0 71 25
Judge. 0 71 25

We 0 71 26
will 0 71 26
be 0 71 26
demanding 0 71 26

will 0 71 26
likewise 0 71 26

be 0 71 26
subpoenaed 0 71 26

on 0 71 26

“My 0 71 27
client 0 71 27
is 0 71 27
not 0 71 27
Deborah 0 71 27
Ramirez.” 0 71 27

Washington 0 71 28
insiders 0 71 28
still 0 71 28
believe 0 71 28
Kavanaugh 0 71 28
will 0 71 28
be 0 71 28
confirmed, 0 71 28
or 0 71 28
at 0 71 28
least 0 71 28
they 0 71 28
did 0 71 28
before 0 71 28
the 0 71 28
two 0 71 28
new 0 71 28

up. 0 71 28

that 0 71 29
the 0 71 29

would 0 71 29

we 0 71 31
ought 0 71 31
to 0 71 31

that. 0 71 31

The 0 71 32
prospect 0 71 32
that 0 71 32
the 0 71 32

take 0 71 32
