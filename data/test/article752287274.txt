After 0 71 46
court, 0 71 46
Hadeed 0 71 46
told 0 71 46
reporters 0 71 46
Bacon 0 71 46
had 0 71 46
threatened 0 71 46
to 0 71 46

him 0 71 46
for 0 71 46
defamation. 0 71 46

“I 0 71 47

outside 0 71 47

“I 0 71 48

In 0 71 49
court, 0 71 49
Bacon 0 71 49
badgered 0 71 49
Hadeed. 0 71 49

“Are 0 71 50
you 0 71 50

not. 0 71 51

I 0 71 52
hope 0 71 52
you 0 71 52
learned 0 71 52
that 0 71 52
lesson,” 0 71 52

said. 0 71 52

“You 1 71 53
have 1 71 53
no 1 71 53

do 1 71 53
you? 1 71 53

You’re 0 71 54
like, 0 71 54
talking 1 71 54
to 1 71 54
a 1 71 54
wall,” 1 71 54
he 0 71 54
said 0 71 54
of 0 71 54
Gilani. 0 71 54

Hadeed 0 71 55
said 0 71 55
three 0 71 55
different 0 71 55
signatures 0 71 55
from 0 71 55
Abid 0 71 55
on 0 71 55
financial 0 71 55
documents 0 71 55
did 0 71 55
not 0 71 55
match, 0 71 55
and 0 71 55
put 0 71 55
a 0 71 55
defiant 0 71 55
Abid 0 71 55
on 0 71 55
the 0 71 55
witness 0 71 55
stand. 0 71 55

Hadeed: 0 71 56
Why 1 71 56
do 1 71 56
your 1 71 56
signatures 1 71 56
look 1 71 56
different? 1 71 56

Abid: 0 71 57
My 0 71 57
signatures 0 71 57
are 0 71 57
not 0 71 57
very 0 71 57
consistent, 0 71 57
I’m 1 71 57
just 1 71 57
a 1 71 57
human 1 71 57
being… 1 71 57

Hadeed: 0 71 58
You 0 71 58
were 0 71 58
aware 0 71 58
you 0 71 58
were 0 71 58
changing 0 71 58
beneficiary 0 71 58
from 0 71 58
your 0 71 58
father’s 0 71 58
spouse 0 71 58
to 0 71 58
yourself? 0 71 58

Abid: 0 71 59
That 0 71 59
was 0 71 59
my 0 71 59
father’s 0 71 59
request… 0 71 59

Hadeed: 0 71 60
You’re 0 71 60
not 0 71 60
answering 0 71 60
the 0 71 60
question. 0 71 60

Abid: 0 71 61
I’m 0 71 61
not 0 71 61
very 0 71 61
smart, 0 71 61
so 0 71 61
it 0 71 61
takes 0 71 61
a 0 71 61
while 0 71 61
sometimes… 0 71 61

Judge: 0 71 62
I 1 71 62
don’t 1 71 62
understand 1 71 62
why 1 71 62
the 1 71 62
witness 1 71 62
is 1 71 62
having 1 71 62
such 1 71 62
trouble 1 71 62
with 1 71 62
the 1 71 62
question. 1 71 62

Your 0 71 63
job 0 71 63
is 0 71 63
to 0 71 63
answer 0 71 63
the 0 71 63
question. 0 71 63

In 0 71 64
court 0 71 64
documents, 0 71 64
Gilani 0 71 64
alleged, 0 71 64
“while 0 71 64
he 0 71 64
was 0 71 64
admitted 0 71 64
in 0 71 64

my 0 71 64

some 0 71 64
other 0 71 64

also 0 71 64
installed/planted 0 71 64
in 0 71 64
my 0 71 64
house 0 71 64
… 0 71 64
Imran 0 71 64
Awan 0 71 64
showed 0 71 64
up 0 71 64
and 0 71 64
threatened 0 71 64
me 0 71 64
for 0 71 64
me 0 71 64
calling 0 71 64
the 0 71 64
police. 0 71 64

[Imran] 0 71 65
threatened 1 71 65
that 1 71 65
he 1 71 65
is 1 71 65

powerful 1 71 65
and 0 71 65
if 1 71 65
I 1 71 65
ever 1 71 65
call 1 71 65
the 1 71 65
police 1 71 65
again 1 71 65
[he] 1 71 65
will 1 71 65
do 1 71 65
harm 1 71 65
to 1 71 65
me.” 1 71 65
She 0 71 65
said 0 71 65
that 0 71 65
Imran 0 71 65
eventually 0 71 65
agreed 0 71 65
to 0 71 65
remove 0 71 65
the 0 71 65
listening 0 71 65
devices 0 71 65
and 0 71 65
did 0 71 65
so 0 71 65
in 0 71 65
front 0 71 65
of 0 71 65
her. 0 71 65

Based 0 71 66
on 0 71 66
Hadeed’s 0 71 66
narrow 0 71 66
legal 0 71 66
argument 0 71 66
about 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
life 0 71 66
insurance 0 71 66
contract’s 0 71 66
language, 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
judge 0 71 66
ruled 0 71 66
that, 0 71 66
“The 0 71 66
son 0 71 66
as 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
owner 0 71 66
of 0 71 66
the 0 71 66

the 0 71 66
absolute 0 71 66
right 0 71 66
to 0 71 66
change 0 71 66
the 0 71 66
beneficiary.” 0 71 66

After 0 71 67
Gilani 0 71 67
retained 0 71 67
a 0 71 67
lawyer, 0 71 67
Bacon 0 71 67
had 0 71 67
offered 0 71 67
a 0 71 67
settlement 0 71 67
where 0 71 67
they’d 0 71 67
split 0 71 67
the 0 71 67
money, 0 71 67
but 0 71 67
Gilani 0 71 67
declined 0 71 67
it. 0 71 67

The 0 71 68
court 0 71 68
awarded 0 71 68
Abid 0 71 68
the 0 71 68
$50,000 0 71 68
life 0 71 68
insurance 0 71 68
payout, 0 71 68
minus 0 71 68
$5,000 0 71 68
that 0 71 68
the 0 71 68
insurance 0 71 68
company 0 71 68
took 0 71 68
for 0 71 68
its 0 71 68
expenses 0 71 68
in 0 71 68
litigating 0 71 68
the 0 71 68
fraud 0 71 68
allegations. 0 71 68

“You 0 71 69
should 0 71 69
have 0 71 69
taken 0 71 69
the 0 71 69
settlement. 0 71 69

Now 0 71 70
she’s 0 71 70
not 0 71 70
getting 0 71 70
a 0 71 70
penny,” 0 71 70
Bacon 0 71 70
said 0 71 70
in 0 71 70
court. 0 71 70

“You’re 0 71 71
not 0 71 71
getting 0 71 71
anything.” 0 71 71

Gilani 0 71 72
said 0 71 72
after 0 71 72
court 0 71 72
that 0 71 72
her 0 71 72
conscience 0 71 72
didn’t 0 71 72
allow 0 71 72
her 0 71 72
to 0 71 72
settle. 0 71 72

“I 0 71 73
didn’t 0 71 73
do 0 71 73
the 0 71 73
deal 0 71 73
because 0 71 73
they 0 71 73
had 0 71 73
been 0 71 73
adopting 0 71 73
bad 0 71 73
behaviors. 0 71 73

I 0 71 74
cannot 0 71 74
agree 0 71 74
to 0 71 74
that. 0 71 74

It 0 71 75
wasn’t 0 71 75
about 0 71 75
the 0 71 75
money,” 0 71 75
