derided 0 86 1

that 0 86 2

the 0 86 8
Church 0 86 8
will 0 86 8
doubt 0 86 8
as 0 86 8
Peter 0 86 8
doubted. 0 86 8

She 0 86 9
will 0 86 9
be 0 86 9

that 0 86 9

In 0 86 10

But 1 86 20
he 1 86 20

evidence 1 86 20
that 1 86 20
the 1 86 20

a 1 86 20

“Act 1 86 25
bravely, 1 86 25

both 0 86 26
spiritual 0 86 26

abound; 0 86 26
the 0 86 26
charity 0 86 26
of 0 86 26
many 0 86 26
will 0 86 26
grow 0 86 26

the 1 86 26

The 1 86 27

unusual 1 86 27
power; 1 86 27

our 1 86 27
Order, 1 86 27

much 1 86 27

with 1 86 27

perfect 1 86 27

That 0 86 44

indefectibility 0 86 44

the 0 86 44
