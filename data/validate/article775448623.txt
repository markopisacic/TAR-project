The 0 50 8
case 0 50 8
involves 0 50 8
Cody 0 50 8
Wilson, 0 50 8
founder 0 50 8
of 0 50 8
Defense 0 50 8
Distributed, 0 50 8
who 0 50 8
sued 0 50 8
the 0 50 8
government 0 50 8
in 0 50 8
2015 0 50 8
after 0 50 8
the 0 50 8
State 0 50 8

the 0 50 8

down 0 50 8

he 0 50 8
had 0 50 8

online, 0 50 8
saying 0 50 8
they 0 50 8
violated 0 50 8

regulations 0 50 8
governing 0 50 8
military 0 50 8

and 0 50 8

Mr. 0 50 9
Wilson, 0 50 9
an 1 50 9
avowed 1 50 9
anarchist 1 50 9
who 1 50 9
hopes 1 50 9
for 1 50 9
a 1 50 9
world 1 50 9
in 1 50 9
which 1 50 9
governments 1 50 9
can’t 1 50 9
stop 1 50 9
individuals 1 50 9
from 1 50 9
getting 1 50 9
guns, 1 50 9
claimed 0 50 9
his 0 50 9
First 0 50 9
Amendment 0 50 9
right 0 50 9
to 0 50 9
free 0 50 9
speech 0 50 9
was 0 50 9
being 0 50 9
violated. 0 50 9

But 0 50 10
he 0 50 10
lost 0 50 10
at 0 50 10
every 0 50 10
stage 0 50 10
of 0 50 10
litigation, 0 50 10
including 0 50 10
a 0 50 10
refusal 0 50 10
by 0 50 10
the 0 50 10
Supreme 0 50 10
Court 0 50 10
to 0 50 10
review 0 50 10
a 0 50 10
decision 0 50 10
that 0 50 10
the 0 50 10

the 0 50 10
course 0 50 10
of 0 50 10
the 0 50 10
lawsuit. 0 50 10

So 1 50 11
it 1 50 11
was 1 50 11
stunning 1 50 11
— 0 50 11
but 1 50 11
not 1 50 11
surprising, 1 50 11
given 1 50 11
this 1 50 11

Mike 0 50 15

about 0 50 15
the 0 50 15
issue 0 50 15
Wednesday 0 50 15

“Why 1 50 16
on 1 50 16
earth 1 50 16
would 1 50 16
the 1 50 16
Trump 1 50 16
administration 1 50 16
make 1 50 16
it 1 50 16
easier 1 50 16
for 1 50 16
terrorists 1 50 16
and 1 50 16
gunmen 1 50 16
to 1 50 16
produce 1 50 16
undetectable 1 50 16
plastic 1 50 16

asked 0 50 16
Sen. 0 50 16
Robert 0 50 16
Menendez 0 50 16
(D-N.J.). 0 50 16

Mr. 0 50 17

to 0 50 17
“take 0 50 17
a 0 50 17

at 0 50 17
it.” 0 50 17

That’s 0 50 18
not 0 50 18
enough. 0 50 18

Ghost 1 50 19
guns 1 50 19
are 1 50 19
already 1 50 19
a 1 50 19
problem; 1 50 19
they 1 50 19
are 1 50 19
used 1 50 19
not 1 50 19
just 1 50 19
by 1 50 19
lone 1 50 19
shooters 1 50 19
but 1 50 19
as 1 50 19

this 1 50 21
foolhardy 1 50 21
