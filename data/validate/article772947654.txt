Gingrich: 0 295 0
The 0 295 0
truth 0 295 0
about 0 295 0
Trump, 0 295 0
Putin, 0 295 0
and 0 295 0
Obama 0 295 0

President 0 295 1
Trump’s 0 295 1
summit 0 295 1
Monday 0 295 1
with 0 295 1
Russian 0 295 1
President 0 295 1
Vladimir 0 295 1
Putin 0 295 1
in 0 295 1
Helsinki 0 295 1
created 0 295 1
a 0 295 1
firestorm 1 295 1
of 0 295 1
controversy. 0 295 1

President 0 295 2
Trump 0 295 2
seemed 0 295 2
to 0 295 2
be 0 295 2
publicly 0 295 2
siding 0 295 2
with 0 295 2
the 0 295 2
Russian 1 295 2
dictator 1 295 2
against 0 295 2
the 0 295 2
American 0 295 2
intelligence 0 295 2
agencies. 0 295 2

The 0 295 3
initial 0 295 3
appearance 0 295 3
was 0 295 3
so 0 295 3
bad 1 295 3
that 0 295 3
I 0 295 3
tweeted: 0 295 3
“President 0 295 3
Trump 0 295 3
must 0 295 3
clarify 0 295 3
his 0 295 3
statements 0 295 3
in 0 295 3
Helsinki 0 295 3
on 0 295 3
our 0 295 3
intelligence 0 295 3
system 0 295 3
and 0 295 3
Putin. 0 295 3

It 0 295 4
is 0 295 4
the 1 295 4
most 1 295 4
serious 1 295 4
mistake 0 295 4
of 0 295 4
his 0 295 4
presidency 0 295 4
and 0 295 4
must 0 295 4
be 0 295 4
corrected 0 295 4
– 0 295 4
immediately.” 0 295 4

After 0 295 5
flying 0 295 5
home 0 295 5
from 0 295 5
Helsinki 0 295 5
and 0 295 5
reviewing 0 295 5
the 0 295 5
tape 0 295 5
and 0 295 5
transcript 0 295 5
of 0 295 5
his 0 295 5
press 0 295 5
conference 0 295 5
with 0 295 5
Putin, 0 295 5
President 0 295 5
Trump 0 295 5
said 0 295 5
he 0 295 5
has 0 295 5
“full 0 295 5
faith 0 295 5
and 0 295 5
support 0 295 5
for 0 295 5
America’s 1 295 5
great 1 295 5
intelligence 1 295 5
agencies” 1 295 5
and 0 295 5
that 0 295 5
he 0 295 5
accepts 0 295 5
“our 0 295 5
intelligence 0 295 5
community’s 0 295 5
conclusion 0 295 5
that 0 295 5
Russia’s 0 295 5
meddling 0 295 5
in 0 295 5
the 0 295 5
2016 0 295 5
election 0 295 5
took 0 295 5
place.” 0 295 5

In 0 295 6
his 0 295 6
remarks 0 295 6
to 0 295 6
members 0 295 6
of 0 295 6
Congress 0 295 6
Tuesday 0 295 6
that 0 295 6
were 0 295 6
televised 0 295 6
by 0 295 6
the 0 295 6
media, 0 295 6
President 0 295 6
Trump 0 295 6
went 0 295 6
on 0 295 6
to 0 295 6
admit 0 295 6
that 0 295 6
he 0 295 6
realized 0 295 6
he 0 295 6
needed 0 295 6
to 0 295 6
clarify 0 295 6
his 0 295 6
statements 0 295 6
in 0 295 6
Helsinki. 0 295 6

The 0 295 7
president 0 295 7
said: 0 295 7
“It 0 295 7
should 0 295 7
have 0 295 7
been 0 295 7
obvious 0 295 7
– 0 295 7
I 0 295 7
thought 0 295 7
it 0 295 7
would 0 295 7
be 0 295 7
obvious 0 295 7
– 0 295 7
but 0 295 7
I 0 295 7
would 0 295 7
like 0 295 7
to 0 295 7
clarify, 0 295 7
just 0 295 7
in 0 295 7
case 0 295 7
it 0 295 7
wasn’t. 0 295 7

In 0 295 8
a 0 295 8
key 0 295 8
sentence 0 295 8
in 0 295 8
my 0 295 8
remarks, 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
said 0 295 8
the 0 295 8
word 0 295 8
‘would’ 0 295 8
instead 0 295 8
of 0 295 8
“wouldn’t.” 0 295 8
The 0 295 8
sentence 0 295 8
should 0 295 8
have 0 295 8
been: 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
don’t 0 295 8
see 0 295 8
any 0 295 8
reason 0 295 8
why 0 295 8
I 0 295 8
wouldn’t 0 295 8
– 0 295 8
or 0 295 8
why 0 295 8
it 0 295 8
wouldn’t 0 295 8
be 0 295 8
Russia. 0 295 8

So 0 295 9
just 0 295 9
to 0 295 9
repeat 0 295 9
it, 0 295 9
I 0 295 9
said 0 295 9
the 0 295 9
word 0 295 9
‘would’ 0 295 9
instead 0 295 9
of 0 295 9
‘wouldn’t’ 0 295 9
… 0 295 9

“I 0 295 10
have, 0 295 10
on 0 295 10
numerous 0 295 10
occasions, 0 295 10
noted 0 295 10
our 0 295 10
intelligence 0 295 10
findings 0 295 10
that 0 295 10
Russians 0 295 10
attempted 0 295 10
to 0 295 10
interfere 0 295 10
in 0 295 10
our 1 295 10
elections. 0 295 10

Unlike 0 295 11
previous 0 295 11
administrations, 0 295 11
my 0 295 11
administration 0 295 11
has 0 295 11
and 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
continue 0 295 11
to 0 295 11
move 0 295 11
aggressively 1 295 11
to 0 295 11
repeal 0 295 11
any 0 295 11
efforts 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
and 0 295 11
repel 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
we 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
stop 0 295 11
it, 0 295 11
we 0 295 11
will 0 295 11
repel 0 295 11
it 0 295 11
– 0 295 11
any 0 295 11
efforts 0 295 11
to 0 295 11
interfere 0 295 11
in 0 295 11
our 1 295 11
elections. 0 295 11

We’re 0 295 12
doing 0 295 12
everything 0 295 12
in 0 295 12
our 1 295 12
power 0 295 12
to 0 295 12
prevent 0 295 12
Russian 0 295 12
interference 0 295 12
in 0 295 12
2018.” 0 295 12

Anyone 0 295 13
who 0 295 13
has 0 295 13
studied 0 295 13
President 0 295 13
Trump 0 295 13
knows 0 295 13
he 0 295 13
hates 0 295 13
to 0 295 13
admit 0 295 13
a 0 295 13
mistake. 0 295 13

His 0 295 14
natural 0 295 14
pattern 0 295 14
is 0 295 14
to 0 295 14
move 0 295 14
forward 0 295 14
and 0 295 14
ignore 0 295 14
mistakes. 0 295 14

For 0 295 15
him, 0 295 15
this 0 295 15
was 0 295 15
a 0 295 15
big 0 295 15
correction 0 295 15
(and 0 295 15
as 0 295 15
I 0 295 15
noted 0 295 15
the 0 295 15
day 0 295 15
before, 0 295 15
it 0 295 15
was 0 295 15
an 0 295 15
absolutely 0 295 15
necessary 0 295 15
one). 0 295 15

President 1 295 16
Trump 1 295 16
then 1 295 16
reminded 1 295 16
everyone 1 295 16
of 1 295 16
the 1 295 16
Obama 1 295 16
administration’s 1 295 16
failures 1 295 16
in 1 295 16
dealing 1 295 16
with 1 295 16
Russian 1 295 16
meddling 1 295 16
in 1 295 16
the 1 295 16
election. 1 295 16

President 0 295 17
Trump 0 295 17
noted 0 295 17
that 0 295 17
President 0 295 17
Obama 0 295 17
and 0 295 17
his 0 295 17
advisers 0 295 17
had 0 295 17
information 0 295 17
that 0 295 17
the 0 295 17
Russians 0 295 17
had 0 295 17
been 0 295 17
working 0 295 17
to 0 295 17
interfere 0 295 17
in 0 295 17
the 0 295 17
election 0 295 17
and 0 295 17
they 0 295 17
ignored 0 295 17
it, 0 295 17
because 1 295 17
they 1 295 17
thought 1 295 17
Hillary 1 295 17
Clinton 1 295 17
was 1 295 17
going 1 295 17
to 1 295 17
win. 1 295 17

President 0 295 18
Trump 0 295 18
said: 0 295 18
“President 0 295 18
Obama, 0 295 18
along 0 295 18
with 0 295 18
(then-CIA 0 295 18
Director 0 295 18
John) 0 295 18
Brennan 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
(then 0 295 18
Director 0 295 18
of 0 295 18
National 0 295 18
Intelligence 0 295 18
James) 0 295 18
Clapper 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
the 0 295 18
whole 0 295 18
group 0 295 18
that 0 295 18
you 0 295 18
see 0 295 18
on 0 295 18
television 0 295 18
now 0 295 18
– 0 295 18
probably 0 295 18
getting 0 295 18
paid 0 295 18
a 0 295 18
lot 0 295 18
of 0 295 18
money 0 295 18
by 0 295 18
your 0 295 18
networks 0 295 18
– 0 295 18
they 0 295 18
knew 0 295 18
about 0 295 18
Russia’s 0 295 18
attempt 0 295 18
to 0 295 18
interfere 0 295 18
in 0 295 18
the 0 295 18
election 0 295 18
in 0 295 18
September, 0 295 18
and 0 295 18
they 0 295 18
totally 0 295 18
buried 0 295 18
it. 0 295 18

And 0 295 19
as 0 295 19
I 0 295 19
said, 0 295 19
they 0 295 19
buried 0 295 19
it 0 295 19
because 1 295 19
they 1 295 19
thought 1 295 19
that 1 295 19
Hillary 1 295 19
Clinton 1 295 19
was 1 295 19
going 1 295 19
to 1 295 19
win. 1 295 19

It 0 295 20
turned 0 295 20
out 0 295 20
it 0 295 20
didn’t 0 295 20
happen 0 295 20
that 0 295 20
way. 0 295 20

“By 0 295 21
contrast, 0 295 21
my 0 295 21
administration 0 295 21
has 0 295 21
taken 0 295 21
a 0 295 21
very 0 295 21
firm 0 295 21
stance 0 295 21
– 0 295 21
it’s 1 295 21
a 1 295 21
very 1 295 21
firm 1 295 21
stance 1 295 21
– 0 295 21
on 0 295 21
a 0 295 21
strong 0 295 21
action. 0 295 21

We’re 0 295 22
going 0 295 22
to 0 295 22
take 0 295 22
strong 1 295 22
action 1 295 22
to 0 295 22
secure 0 295 22
our 0 295 22
election 0 295 22
systems 0 295 22
and 0 295 22
the 0 295 22
process.” 0 295 22

There 0 295 23
are 0 295 23
two 0 295 23
key 0 295 23
facts 0 295 23
in 0 295 23
this 0 295 23
statement. 0 295 23

First, 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
very 0 295 24
people 0 295 24
who 0 295 24
have 0 295 24
been 0 295 24
loudest 1 295 24
in 0 295 24
attacking 0 295 24
President 0 295 24
Trump 0 295 24
about 0 295 24
his 0 295 24
performance 0 295 24
at 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
Helsinki 0 295 24
summit 0 295 24
are 0 295 24
the 0 295 24
people 0 295 24
who 0 295 24
failed 0 295 24
to 0 295 24
protect 0 295 24
America 0 295 24
from 0 295 24
Russian 0 295 24
meddling 0 295 24
in 0 295 24
2016. 0 295 24

The 1 295 25
very 1 295 25
intensity 0 295 25
and 0 295 25
nastiness 1 295 25
of 0 295 25
former 0 295 25
CIA 0 295 25
Director 0 295 25
Brennan 0 295 25
and 0 295 25
former 0 295 25
Director 0 295 25
of 0 295 25
National 0 295 25
Intelligence 0 295 25
Clapper 0 295 25
is 0 295 25
an 0 295 25
attempt 0 295 25
to 0 295 25
distract 0 295 25
attention 0 295 25
from 0 295 25
their 0 295 25
failure 0 295 25
to 1 295 25
protect 1 295 25
America. 1 295 25

It 0 295 26
was 0 295 26
their 0 295 26
duty 0 295 26
in 0 295 26
2016 0 295 26
– 0 295 26
not 0 295 26
candidate 0 295 26
Trump’s. 0 295 26

Second, 0 295 27
the 0 295 27
Trump 0 295 27
administration 0 295 27
has 0 295 27
been 0 295 27
far 0 295 27
tougher 0 295 27
on 0 295 27
Russia 0 295 27
than 0 295 27
President 0 295 27
Obama 0 295 27
ever 0 295 27
dreamed 0 295 27
of 0 295 27
being. 0 295 27

The 1 295 28
Trump 1 295 28
administration 1 295 28
is 0 295 28
taking 0 295 28
real 0 295 28
actions 0 295 28
designed 0 295 28
to 0 295 28
weaken 0 295 28
Russia 0 295 28
and 0 295 28
force 0 295 28
Putin 0 295 28
to 0 295 28
change 0 295 28
his 0 295 28
aggressive 1 295 28
behavior. 0 295 28

The 1 295 29
Trump 1 295 29
administration 1 295 29
has 0 295 29
levied 0 295 29
tough 0 295 29
sanctions 0 295 29
on 0 295 29
Russia. 0 295 29

Also, 0 295 30
President 0 295 30
Trump’s 0 295 30
public 0 295 30
lecture 0 295 30
about 0 295 30
Germany 0 295 30
not 0 295 30
buying 0 295 30
natural 0 295 30
gas 0 295 30
from 0 295 30
Russia 0 295 30
was 0 295 30
aimed 0 295 30
at 0 295 30
cutting 0 295 30
Putin 0 295 30
off 0 295 30
from 0 295 30
hard 0 295 30
currency 0 295 30
worth 0 295 30
tens 0 295 30
of 0 295 30
billions 0 295 30
of 0 295 30
dollars 0 295 30
and 0 295 30
further 0 295 30
weakening 0 295 30
the 0 295 30
Russian 0 295 30
economy. 0 295 30

Furthermore, 0 295 31
President 0 295 31
Trump’s 0 295 31
efforts 0 295 31
to 0 295 31
get 0 295 31
our 0 295 31
European 0 295 31
allies 0 295 31
to 0 295 31
increase 0 295 31
their 0 295 31
defense 0 295 31
spending 0 295 31
has 0 295 31
a 0 295 31
direct 0 295 31

the 1 295 36

More 0 295 38
than 0 295 38
100 0 295 38
Russian 0 295 38
individuals 0 295 38
and 0 295 38

for 0 295 38
a 0 295 38
variety 0 295 38
of 0 295 38
reasons. 0 295 38

Despite 0 295 39
the 0 295 39
hysteria 0 295 39
of 0 295 39
the 0 295 39
left, 0 295 39
it 0 295 39
is 0 295 39
impossible 0 295 39
to 0 295 39
see 0 295 39
the 1 295 39
Trump 1 295 39
administration 1 295 39
as 0 295 39
anything 0 295 39
but 0 295 39

in 0 295 39
its 0 295 39
dealing 0 295 39
with 0 295 39
Russia. 0 295 39

Nothing 0 295 40
done 0 295 40
in 0 295 40
Helsinki 0 295 40
made 0 295 40
life 0 295 40
easier 0 295 40
for 0 295 40
the 0 295 40
Putin 0 295 40

in 0 295 40
its 0 295 40
continued 0 295 40
economic 0 295 40
decay 0 295 40
and 0 295 40
diplomatic 0 295 40

due 0 295 40

the 0 295 40

Finally, 0 295 41
a 0 295 41
brief 0 295 41
word 0 295 41
about 0 295 41
the 0 295 41
strong 0 295 41

and 0 295 41
vicious 1 295 41
comments 0 295 41
about 0 295 41
the 0 295 41

We 0 295 42
are 0 295 42
in 0 295 42
the 0 295 42
early 0 295 42
stages 0 295 42
of 0 295 42
a 0 295 42
cultural 0 295 42
civil 0 295 42
war 0 295 42
in 0 295 42
which 0 295 42
the 0 295 42
left 0 295 42
sees 0 295 42
itself 0 295 42
losing. 0 295 42

This 0 295 43
is 0 295 43
what 0 295 43
led 0 295 43
me 0 295 43
to 0 295 43

With 0 295 43
each 0 295 43

more 0 295 43
and 0 295 43
more. 0 295 43

With 0 295 44
President 0 295 44
Trump’s 0 295 44
nomination 0 295 44
of 0 295 44
Judge 0 295 44
Brett 0 295 44
Kavanaugh 0 295 44
to 0 295 44
the 0 295 44
Supreme 0 295 44
Court, 0 295 44
it 0 295 44
was 0 295 44
clear 0 295 44
that 0 295 44
anyone 0 295 44
Trump 0 295 44
nominated 0 295 44
was 0 295 44
going 0 295 44
to 0 295 44
be 0 295 44
attacked. 0 295 44

In 0 295 45
fact, 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
demonstrators 0 295 45
protesting 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
nomination 0 295 45
had 0 295 45
signs 0 295 45
for 0 295 45
all 0 295 45
four 0 295 45
of 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
finalists 0 295 45
and 0 295 45
were 0 295 45
instantly 0 295 45
ready 0 295 45
to 0 295 45
oppose 0 295 45
the 0 295 45
president 0 295 45
regardless 0 295 45
of 0 295 45
his 0 295 45
choice. 0 295 45

Similarly, 0 295 46
Obama-era 0 295 46
national 0 295 46
security 0 295 46
officials 0 295 46
seem 0 295 46
determined 0 295 46
to 0 295 46
use 0 295 46
the 0 295 46
harshest 1 295 46
possible 1 295 46
language 0 295 46
to 0 295 46
attack 0 295 46
President 0 295 46
Trump. 0 295 46

I 0 295 47
think 0 295 47
their 0 295 47
strong 0 295 47
words 0 295 47
and 0 295 47
hysteria 1 295 47
are 0 295 47
driven 1 295 47
by 1 295 47
their 1 295 47
own 1 295 47
guilt. 1 295 47

Whatever 0 295 48
the 0 295 48
Russians 0 295 48
did, 0 295 48
they 0 295 48
did 0 295 48
while 0 295 48
Brennan 0 295 48
was 0 295 48
director 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
the 0 295 48
CIA, 0 295 48
Clapper 0 295 48
was 0 295 48
director 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
national 0 295 48
intelligence, 0 295 48
and 0 295 48
James 0 295 48
Comey 0 295 48
was 0 295 48
head 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
the 0 295 48
Federal 0 295 48
Bureau 0 295 48
of 0 295 48
Investigation. 0 295 48

These 0 295 49
former 0 295 49
officials 0 295 49
attack 0 295 49
Trump 0 295 49
ferociously 1 295 49
to 0 295 49
hide 0 295 49
their 0 295 49
own 0 295 49
failure 0 295 49
and 0 295 49
their 0 295 49
own 0 295 49
guilt. 0 295 49

Just 0 295 50
keep 0 295 50
that 0 295 50
in 0 295 50
mind 0 295 50
the 0 295 50
next 0 295 50
time 0 295 50
you 0 295 50
see 0 295 50
one 0 295 50
of 0 295 50
them 0 295 50
on 0 295 50
TV. 0 295 50

My 0 295 50

prediction 0 295 50

is 0 295 50

that 0 295 50

President 0 295 50

Trump 0 295 50

will 0 295 50

remain 0 295 50

tough 0 295 50

on 0 295 50

Russia, 0 295 50

and 0 295 50

the 0 295 50

Helsinki 0 295 50

press 0 295 50

conference 0 295 50

will 0 295 50

be 0 295 50

seen 0 295 50

as 0 295 50

the 0 295 50

aberration 0 295 50

it 0 295 50

was. 0 295 50
