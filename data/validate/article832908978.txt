Trump 0
Kept 0
Asking 0
Friends 0
If 0
the 0
Mueller 0
Report 0
Would 0
Drop 0
This 0
Week 0

On 0
Wednesday, 0
Donald 0
Trump 0
was 0
flying 0
to 0
a 0
military 0
tank 0
plant 0
in 0
Lima, 0
Ohio, 0
to 0
deliver 0
a 0
speech 0
on 0
the 0
economy, 0
but, 0
as 0
is 0
frequently 0
the 0
case, 0
the 0
president 0
had 0
something 0
more 0
pressing 0
on 0
his 0
mind. 0

While 0
aboard 0
Air 0
Force 0
One, 0
the 0
president 0
killed 0
some 0
time 0
by 0
picking 0
up 0
the 0
phone 0
and 0
ringing 0
associates 0
to 0
ask 0
them 0
if 0
they 0
thought 0
Special 0
Counsel 0
Robert 0
Mueller’s 0
report 0
would 0
be 0
sent 0
to 0
the 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice 0
this 0
week, 0
according 0
to 0
a 0
source 0
with 0
knowledge 0
of 0
these 0
conversations. 0

The 0
report, 0
which 0
would 0
mark 0
the 0
culmination 0
of 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
team’s 0
investigation 0
into 0
alleged 0
Russian 0
interference 0
in 0
the 0
2016 0
presidential 0
election 0
and 0
potential 0
obstruction 0
of 0
justice, 0
has 0
for 0
many 0
months 0
kicked 0
off 0
round 0
after 0
round 0
of 0
speculation 0
among 0
the 0
media 0
and 0
political 0
class 0
about 0
when, 0
exactly, 0
it 0
will 0
finally 0
be 0
delivered 0
to 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department. 0

This 0
week, 0
the 0
President 0
of 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
himself 0
joined 0
in 0
on 0
the 0
anxious 0
anticipation 0
and 0
the 1
Mueller 1
report 1
guessing 1
game. 1

According 0
to 0
three 0
knowledgeable 0
sources, 0
Trump 0
has 0
quizzed 0
various 0
people—administration 0
officials, 0
friends, 0
his 0
legal 0
team—throughout 0
the 0
week 0
if 0
they 0
believed 0
the 0
buzz 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
could 0
be 0
delivered 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
this 0
week. 0

The 0
president, 0
these 0
sources 0
said, 0
speculated 0
on 0
when 0
he 0
thought 0
it 0
would 0
finally 0
happen, 0
repeatedly 0
citing 0
news 0
reports 0
from 0
this 0
week 0
on 0
a 0
possible 0
imminent 0
delivery. 0

Reached 0
for 0
comment, 0
White 0
House 0
Press 0
Secretary 0
Sarah 0
Huckabee 0
Sanders 0
replied 0
that 0
there 0
was 0
“nothing 1
to 1
add 1
right 1
now,” 1
as 0
of 0
Friday 0
afternoon. 0

“I 0
told 0
the 0
president 0
this 0
morning 0
[to] 0
go 0
about 0
your 0
schedule, 0
we’re 0
prepared 0
for 0
anything,” 0
Rudy 0
Giuliani, 0
one 0
of 0
Trump’s 0
personal 0
attorneys, 0
told 0
The 0
Daily 0
Beast 0
on 0
Friday, 0
adding 0
that 0
he 0
spoke 0
with 0
the 0
president 0
in 0
person 0
on 0
Thursday. 0

Giuliani 0
said 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
the 0
president 0
have 0
been 0
hearing 0
the 0
report 0
delivery 0
could 0
happen 0
“today,” 0
but 0
clarified 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
client 0
are 0
going 0
off 0
of 0
media, 0
not 0
any 0
“insider 0
information.” 0

Trump’s 0
reelection 0
campaign 0
also 0
got 0
in 0
on 0
this 0
week’s 0
speculation 0
game, 1
texting 0
supporters 0
early 0
Friday 0
afternoon, 0
“President 0
Trump 0
has 0
put 0
up 0
with 0
the 1
WITCH 1
HUNT 1
for 0
2 0
YEARS. 0

Do 0
you 0
think 0
it's 0
time 0
for 0
it 0
to 0
end? 0

Take 0
our 0
OFFICIAL 0
poll 0
NOW.” 0

The 0
president, 0
who 0
has 0
repeatedly 0
claimed 0
that 0
the 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
is 0
“illegal” 0
and 0
a 1
“WITCH 1
HUNT” 1
driven 0
by 0
angry 1
liberals, 1
made 0
clear 0
to 0
reporters 0
at 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
earlier 0
this 0
week 0
that 0
the 0
coming 0
report 0
was, 0
of 0
course, 0
weighing 0
on 0
him. 0

“Let 1
it 1
come 1
out, 1
let 1
people 1
see 1
it,” 1
Trump 0
said, 0
characterizing 0
the 0
probe 0
and 0
report 0
as 0
“ridiculous,” 1
as 0
he 0
left 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
Wednesday. 0

“Let’s 0
see 0
whether 0
or 0
not 0
it’s 0
legit.” 0

But 0
over 0
the 0
course 0
of 0
the 0
last 0
two 0
years, 0
he 0
hasn’t 0
always 0
been 0
so 0
open 0
to 0
the 0
report 0
seeing 0
the 0
light 0
of 0
day, 0
or 0
even 0
having 0
the 0
investigation 0
conclude. 0

As 0
The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
reported 0
early 0
last 0
year, 0
Trump 0
ordered 0
the 0
firing 0
of 0
the 0
special 0
counsel, 0
but 0
reversed 0
course 0
after 0
the 0
then-White 0
House 0
Counsel 0
Don 0
McGahn 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
resign 1
instead 1
of 1
executing 1
Trump’s 1
order. 1

Still, 0
even 0
after 0
the 0
Mueller 0
probe 0
officially 0
wraps, 0
it 0
is 0
very 0
much 0
the 0
beginning, 0
not 0
a 0
dramatic 0
end, 0
to 0
Trumpworld’s 1
wide-ranging 1
legal 1
woes. 1

On 0
Friday, 0
The 0
Washington 0
Post 0
reported 0
that 0
Democratic 0
chairs 0
of 0
six 0
different 0
House 0
committees 0
investigating 0
Trump 0
and 0
his 0
allies 0
are 0
planning 0
on 0
asking 0
the 0
FBI, 0
Department 0
of 0
Justice, 0
and 0
White 0
House 0
to 0
preserve 0
records 0
provided 0
to 0
Mueller 0
and 0
his 0
investigators. 0

President 0
Trump 0
himself 0
appears 0
to 0
realize 0
that 0
the 1
end 1
is 1
nowhere 1
near. 1

As 0
The 0
Daily 0
Beast 0
reported 0
last 0
month, 0
the 0
president 0
made 0
clear 0
to 0
his 0
outside 0
legal 0
team, 0
which 0
includes 0
Giuliani 0
and 0
Jay 0
Sekulow, 0
that 0
he 0
wanted 0
his 0
attorneys 0
sitting 0
tight, 0
even 0
after 0
the 0
Mueller 0
investigation 0
is 0
history. 0

Trump 0
broached 0
the 0
topic 0
in 0
multiple 0
conversations 0
beginning 0
late 0
last 0
year, 0
while 0
discussing 0
the 0
other 0
inquiries 0
threatening 0
his 0
presidency 0
and 0
inner 0
circle, 0
chief 0
among 0
them 0
the 0
Southern 0
District 0
of 0
New 0
York. 0

But 0
if 0
the 0
Mueller 0
report 0
is 0
actually, 0
finally 0
sent 0
over 0
to 0
the 0
Justice 0
Department 0
by 0
close 0
of 0
business 0
on 0
Friday, 0
the 0
president 0
will 0
be 0
many 0
miles 0
away 0
from 0
it. 0

On 0
Friday 0
morning, 0
Trump 0
flew 0
to 0
Palm 0
Beach, 0
Florida, 0
where 0
he 0
and 0
first 0
lady 0
Melania 0
Trump 0
were 0
scheduled 0
to 0
meet 0
with 0
Caribbean 0
leaders 0
at 0
Mar-a-Lago, 0
the 0
president’s 0
private 0
club 0
and 0
getaway. 0
