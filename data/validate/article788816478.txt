Kavanaugh 0
Battle 0
Brews 0

The 0
Left’s 0
continuing 0
success 0
in 0
delaying 0
a 0
confirmation 0
vote 0
on 0
Judge 0
Brett 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination 0
to 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
reveals 0
its 0
malicious 1
agenda 1
to 0
block 0
the 0
nominee 0
from 0
sitting 0
on 0
the 0
high 0
court 0
when 0
its 0
new 0
term 0
begins 0
Monday, 0
October 0
1. 0

Democrats 0
had 0
Kavanaugh 0
accuser 0
Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford’s 0
never-credible 1
accusations 1
of 1
sexual 1
abuse 1
-- 0
including 0
possible 0
attempted 0
rape 0
-- 0
in 0
hand 0
way 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
summer. 0

They 1
deliberately 1
refused 1
to 1
bring 1
up 1
the 1
allegations, 1
as 1
weak 1
and 1
ridiculous 1
as 1
they 1
are, 1
at 1
Kavanaugh’s 1
Senate 1
confirmation 1
hearings 1
because 1
they 1
didn’t 1
want 1
to 1
have 1
a 1
rational 1
discussion. 1

They 0
wanted 0
to 0
hurl 1
the 1
wild 1
claims 1
like 1
a 1
grenade 1
at 0
the 0
last 0
minute 0
to 0
blow 0
up 0
the 0
process. 0

And 0
so 0
far 0
it 0
appears 0
they’re 0
succeeding. 0

If 0
Kavanaugh 0
isn’t 0
in 0
place 0
a 0
week 0
from 0
Monday, 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court 0
will 0
begin 0
hearing 0
cases 0
in 0
its 0
new 0
term 0
shorthanded. 0

The 0
high 0
court 0
normally 0
has 0
a 0
complement 0
of 0
nine 0
justices 0
but 0
with 0
Associate 0
Justice 0
Anthony 0
Kennedy’s 0
retirement 0
July 0
31, 0
which 0
cleared 0
the 0
way 0
for 0
Kavanaugh’s 0
nomination, 0
there 0
have 0
only 0
been 0
eight 0
justices 0
in 0
place. 0

Roughly 0
speaking 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
4-to-4 0
liberal 0
to 0
conservative 0
ideological 0
split 0
on 0
the 0
court. 0

Democrats 0
would 0
prefer 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
into 0
the 0
next 0
Congress 0
where 0
they 0
hope 0
to 0
take 0
control 0
from 0
Republicans. 0

Election 0
Day 0
is 0
November 0
6. 0

The 0
GOP 0
currently 0
controls 0
the 0
Senate, 0
which 0
has 0
the 0
final 0
say 0
on 0
judicial 0
nominations, 0
by 0
an 0
uncomfortably 0
close 0
margin 0
of 0
51 0
to 0
49. 0

Christine 0
Blasey 0
Ford’s 0
lawyers 0
are 0
trying 0
to 0
game 0
the 0
system. 0

They 0
know 0
that 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
rules 0
require 0
Chairman 0
Chuck 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa) 0
to 0
provide 0
a 0
full 0
week’s 0
notice 0
for 0
a 0
hearing. 0

So, 0
if, 0
for 0
example, 0
the 0
committee 0
followed 0
the 0
rules 0
and 0
agreed 0
Friday 0
(today) 0
to 0
a 0
hearing, 0
the 0
soonest 0
it 0
could 0
be 0
held 0
would 0
be 0
next 0
Friday, 0
the 0
final 0
business 0
day 0
before 0
the 0
Supreme 0
Court’s 0
new 0
term 0
begins. 0

Of 0
course, 0
lawyers 1
are 1
masters 1
of 1
delay, 1
and 0
social 1
justice 1
warrior-lawyers 1
hoping 1
to 1
torpedo 1
President 1
Trump’s 1
agenda 1
have 0
an 0
added 0
incentive 0
to 0
drag 0
the 0
confirmation 0
process 0
out 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
possible. 0

New 0
demands 0
and 0
fake 0
emergencies 0
are 0
bound 0
to 0
arise 0
from 0
Ford’s 0
legal 0
team. 0

It 0
was 0
unclear 0
at 0
press 0
time 0
if 0
the 0
public 0
hearing 0
scheduled 0
for 0
Monday 0
into 0
the 0
allegations 0
of 0
sexual 0
misconduct 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
would 0
go 0
forward. 0

Kavanaugh 0
informed 0
the 0
committee 0
he 0
was 0
willing 0
to 0
testify 0
Monday. 0

“I 0
continue 0
to 0
want 0
a 0
hearing 0
as 0
soon 0
as 0
possible, 0
so 0
that 0
I 0
can 0
clear 0
my 0
name," 0
he 0
wrote 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

Ford's 0
lawyer 0
Debra 0
Katz 0
told 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
her 0
client 0
"wishes 0
to 0
testify, 0
provided 0
that 0
we 0
can 0
agree 0
on 0
terms 0
that 0
are 0
fair 0
and 0
which 0
ensure 0
her 0
safety." 0

Another 0
Ford 0
attorney 0
reportedly 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
there 0
are 0
“multiple 0
witnesses” 0
who 0
need 0
to 0
testify. 0

"A 0
hearing 0
on 0
Monday 0
is 0
not 0
possible 0
and 0
the 0
Committee's 0
insistence 0
that 0
it 0
occur 0
then 0
is 0
arbitrary 0
in 0
any 0
event,” 0
Katz 0
wrote 0
in 0
a 0
letter. 0

“Dr. 0

Ford 0
has 0
asked 0
me 0
to 0
let 0
you 0
know 0
that 0
she 0
appreciates 0
the 0
various 0
options 0
you 0
have 0
suggested. 0

Her 0
strong 0
preference 0
continues 0
to 0
be 0
for 0
the 0
Senate 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
to 0
allow 0
for 0
a 0
full 0
investigation 0
prior 0
to 0
her 0
testimony.” 0

GOP 0
lawmakers 0
are 0
figuring 0
out 0
how 0
to 0
respond 0
to 0
Ford’s 0
request, 0
the 0
San 0
Diego 0
Union-Tribune 0
reports: 0

Late 0
Thursday, 0
Sen. 0
Charles 0
E. 0
Grassley 0
(R-Iowa), 0
the 0
Judiciary 0
Committee 0
chairman, 0
said 0
that 0
his 0
staff 0
had 0
discussed 0
the 0
issue 0
with 0
Ford’s 0
attorney 0
earlier 0
in 0
the 0
day 0
and 0
that 0
he 0
would 0
consult 0
with 0
his 0
fellow 0
committee 0
members 0
about 0
the 0
next 0
move. 0

Ford’s 0
offer 0
also 0
increased 0
the 0
pressure 0
on 0
several 0
key 0
moderates 0
— 0
particularly 0
GOP 0
Sens. 0

Susan 0
Collins 0
of 0
Maine 0
and 0
Lisa 0
Murkowski 0
of 0
Alaska 0
— 0
whose 0
votes 0
will 0
probably 0
be 0
needed 0
to 0
put 0
Kavanaugh 0
on 0
the 0
high 0
court. 0

Both 0
were 0
already 0
facing 0
heavy 0
pressure 0
from 0
abortion 0
rights 0
groups 0
concerned 0
that 0
Kavanaugh, 0
a 1
staunch 1
conservative 1
and 0
longtime 0
GOP 0
attorney, 0
might 0
vote 0
to 0
restrict 0
access 0
to 0
abortion. 0

The 0
sexual 0
assault 0
allegation, 0
which 0
the 0
nominee 0
has 0
denied, 0
has 0
upended 0
his 0
seemingly 0
sure-bet 0
confirmation 0
and 0
only 0
increased 0
the 0
stakes 0
for 0
the 0
key 0
lawmakers. 0

Chairman 0
Grassley 0
had 0
imposed 0
a 0
Thursday 0
deadline 0
for 0
Ford 0
to 0
submit 0
testimony 0
after 0
her 0
team 0
said 0
Tuesday 0
she 0
wasn’t 0
willing 0
to 0
testify 0
until 0
the 0
FBI 0
investigates 0
her 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
allegations 0
against 0
Kavanaugh. 0

Left-wingers 1
such 0
as 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
and 0
Senate 0
Minority 0
Leader 0
Chuck 0
Schumer 0
(D-N.Y.) 0
echoed 0
Ford’s 0
demand. 0

The 0
demand 0
for 0
an 0
FBI 0
probe 0
is 0
“utter 1
nonsense,” 1
former 0
U.S. 0
Attorney 0
Joseph 0
diGenova 0
said 0
earlier 0
this 0
week. 0

Ford 0
“really 0
doesn’t 0
want 0
to 0
testify,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“Because 0
when 0
she 0
does, 0
she 1
is 1
going 1
to 1
look 1
like 1
the 1
loon 1
she 1
is. 1

She 0
may 0
very 0
well 0
believe 0
everything 0
she’s 0
saying, 0
and 0
that 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
signs 0
of 0
lunacy, 0
believing 0
something 0
that 0
isn’t 0
real.” 0
And 0
her 1
lawyer 1
is 1
“even 1
loonier.” 1

Besides, 0
diGenova 0
explained, 0
the 0
eleventh-hour 0
sexual 0
abuse 0
claim 0
leveled 0
against 0
Kavanaugh 0
is 0
a 0
non-federal 0
matter 0
and 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
the 0
alleged 0
assault 0
hasn’t 0
even 0
been 0
clearly 0
outlined 0
by 0
the 0
alleged 0
victim. 0

Ford 0
didn’t 0
report 0
it 0
to 0
anyone 0
for 0
decades 0
and 0
isn’t 0
even 0
certain 0
when 0
or 0
where 0
it 0
happened, 0
so 0
the 0
FBI 0
can’t 0
investigate 0
the 0
matter 0
“because 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
to 0
investigate.” 0

Kavanaugh 0
has 0
already 0
undergone 0
six 0
FBI 0
background 0
checks 0
and 0
the 0
agency 0
has 0
ruled 0
out 0
investigating 0
Ford’s 0
allegation 0
of 0
drunken 0
groping 0
at 0
a 0
teenagers’ 0
party 0
36 0
years 0
ago. 0

Ford’s 1
request 1
for 1
an 1
FBI 1
probe 1
is 1
“clearly 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
delay 1
proceedings,” 1
diGenova 0
said. 0

President 0
Trump 0
is 0
taking 0
the 0
high 0
road 0
and 0
is 0
avoiding 0
attacking 0
Ford, 0
which 0
isn’t 0
a 0
risky 0
move 0
given 0
how 0
obviously 1
unbalanced 1
the 1
accuser 1
is. 1

Ford 0
is 0
already 0
doing 0
an 1
excellent 1
job 1
destroying 1
herself 1
without 0
Republican 0
assistance. 0

At 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
on 0
Wednesday, 0
President 0
Trump 0
said 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
"wonderful" 0
if 0
Ford 0
testifies 0
and 0
"unfortunate" 0
if 0
she 0
does 0
not. 0

He 0
indicated 0
he 0
was 0
keeping 0
an 0
open 0
mind 0
about 0
the 0
allegations 0
but 0
that 0
it 0
was 0
"very 0
hard 0
for 0
me 0
to 0
imagine 0
anything 0
happened" 0
between 0
her 0
and 0
the 0
nominee. 0

"I 0
think 1
he's 1
an 1
extraordinary 1
man 1
– 1
I 1
think 1
he's 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
great 1
intellect, 1
as 1
I've 1
been 1
telling 1
you, 1
and 1
he 1
has 1
an 1
unblemished 1
record," 1
Trump 0
said. 0

"This 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
tough 0
thing 0
for 0
him 0
and 0
his 0
family 0
and 0
we 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
over 0
it 0
but 0
at 0
the 0
same 0
time 0
we 0
want 0
to 0
give 0
tremendous 0
amounts 0
of 0
time. 0

If 0
she 0
shows 0
up 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
wonderful 0
– 0
if 0
she 0
doesn't 0
show 0
up 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
unfortunate." 0
