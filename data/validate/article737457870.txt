The 0 122 1

is 0 122 1
collapsing. 0 122 1

And 0 122 2
that's 0 122 2
due 0 122 2

the 0 122 2

photo. 0 122 6

There's 0 122 7
also 0 122 7
a 0 122 7
quote 0 122 7
from 0 122 7
an 0 122 7
Obama 0 122 7
spokeswoman 0 122 7
claiming 0 122 7
that, 0 122 7
“President 0 122 7
Obama 0 122 7
has 0 122 7
denounced 0 122 7
racism 0 122 7
and 0 122 7
anti-Semitism 0 122 7
his 0 122 7
entire 0 122 7
life. 0 122 7

That 0 122 8
includes 0 122 8
his 0 122 8
public 0 122 8
and 0 122 8
repeated 0 122 8
repudiations 0 122 8
of 0 122 8
Louis 0 122 8
Farrakhan’s 0 122 8
views 0 122 8
over 0 122 8
the 0 122 8
years. 0 122 8

Today 0 122 9
is 0 122 9
no 0 122 9
different 0 122 9
– 0 122 9
he 0 122 9
still 0 122 9
rejects 0 122 9
the 1 122 9
harmful 1 122 9
and 1 122 9
divisive 1 122 9
views 1 122 9
Farrakhan 0 122 9
continues 0 122 9
to 0 122 9
espouse.” 0 122 9

That 0 122 10
fails 1 122 10
to 1 122 10
explain 1 122 10
why 1 122 10
he 1 122 10
met 1 122 10
with 1 122 10
him. 1 122 10

And 0 122 11
maybe 0 122 11
one 0 122 11
of 0 122 11
these 0 122 11
days 0 122 11
someone 0 122 11
will 0 122 11
ask 0 122 11
him 0 122 11
that 0 122 11
question. 0 122 11

And 0 122 12
then 0 122 12
Obama 0 122 12
can 0 122 12
give 0 122 12
a 0 122 12
new 0 122 12
remix 0 122 12
of 0 122 12
his 0 122 12
Wright 0 122 12
speech. 0 122 12

"I 0 122 13
can 0 122 13
no 0 122 13
more 0 122 13
disavow 0 122 13
Calypso 0 122 13
Louie 0 122 13
than 0 122 13
I 0 122 13
can 0 122 13

dead 0 122 13
white 0 122 13

Rep. 0 122 14
Danny 0 122 14
Davis, 0 122 14
after 0 122 14
defending 0 122 14
Farrakhan, 0 122 14
now 0 122 14
has 0 122 14
a 0 122 14
statement 0 122 14
condemning 0 122 14
him. 0 122 14

But 1 122 15
we've 1 122 15
seen 1 122 15
that 1 122 15
before. 1 122 15

So 1 122 16
it 1 122 16
likely 1 122 16
doesn't 1 122 16
represent 1 122 16
his 1 122 16
views. 1 122 16

After 0 122 17
a 0 122 17
previous 0 122 17
statement, 0 122 17
Rep. 0 122 17
Davis 0 122 17
made 0 122 17
an 0 122 17
infamous 0 122 17
comment 0 122 17
about 0 122 17
the 0 122 17
"Jewish 0 122 17
question". 0 122 17

So 0 122 18
it 0 122 18
probably 0 122 18
still 0 122 18
isn't 0 122 18
over. 0 122 18

The 1 122 19
statement 1 122 19
though 1 122 19
is 1 122 19
full 1 122 19
of 1 122 19
conspiracy 1 122 19
theories 1 122 19
and 1 122 19
blames 1 122 19
everyone 1 122 19
else 1 122 19
for 1 122 19
Davis' 1 122 19
behavior 1 122 19
except 1 122 19
him. 1 122 19

And 0 122 20
now 0 122 20
on 0 122 20

willing 0 122 26

whether 0 122 26

his 0 122 26

The 0 122 28

has 0 122 28

Obviously 1 122 29
not 1 122 29
going 1 122 29
to 1 122 29
happen. 1 122 29

But 0 122 30
the 0 122 30
story 0 122 30
is 0 122 30
breaking 0 122 30
through 0 122 30
the 0 122 30
embargo. 0 122 30

We're 1 122 31
starting 1 122 31
to 1 122 31
have 1 122 31
that 1 122 31
"national 1 122 31

about 1 122 31

that 1 122 31
