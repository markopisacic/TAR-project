The 0
media's 0
Farrakhan 0
embargo 0
is 0
collapsing. 0

And 0
that's 0
due 0
to 0
the 0
hard 0
work 0
of 0
committed 0
conservative 0
journalists 0
who 0
stayed 0
on 0
this 0
story, 0
especially 0
at 0
the 0
Daily 0
Caller, 0
which 0
got 0
the 0
Rep. 0
Davis 0
quotes, 0
twice. 0

Some 0
credit 0
also 0
goes 0
to 0
Jake 0
Tapper 0
at 0
CNN 0
and 0
Glenn 0
Kessler 0
at 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
for 0
a 0
willingness 0
to 0
discuss 0
the 0
subject 0
even 0
when 0
their 0
media 0
outlets 0
didn't 0
want 0
to. 0

The 0
debate 0
over 0
the 0
ties 0
between 0
Women's 0
March 0
leaders 0
and 0
Farrakhan 0
made 0
into 0
a 0
debate 0
on 0
the 0
View. 0

And 0
that 0
debate 0
involved 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett. 0

The 0
New 0
York 0
Times 0
has 0
now 0
run 0
its 0
own 0
explainer 0
piece 0
on 0
Farrakhan 0
and 0
the 0
Dems 0
which 0
mentions 0
the 0
infamous 0
Obama-Farrakhan 0
photo. 0

There's 0
also 0
a 0
quote 0
from 0
an 0
Obama 0
spokeswoman 0
claiming 0
that, 0
“President 0
Obama 0
has 0
denounced 0
racism 0
and 0
anti-Semitism 0
his 0
entire 0
life. 0

That 0
includes 0
his 0
public 0
and 0
repeated 0
repudiations 0
of 0
Louis 0
Farrakhan’s 0
views 0
over 0
the 0
years. 0

Today 0
is 0
no 0
different 0
– 0
he 0
still 0
rejects 0
the 1
harmful 1
and 1
divisive 1
views 1
Farrakhan 0
continues 0
to 0
espouse.” 0

That 0
fails 1
to 1
explain 1
why 1
he 1
met 1
with 1
him. 1

And 0
maybe 0
one 0
of 0
these 0
days 0
someone 0
will 0
ask 0
him 0
that 0
question. 0

And 0
then 0
Obama 0
can 0
give 0
a 0
new 0
remix 0
of 0
his 0
Wright 0
speech. 0

"I 0
can 0
no 0
more 0
disavow 0
Calypso 0
Louie 0
than 0
I 0
can 0
my 0
dead 0
white 0
grandmother." 0

Rep. 0
Danny 0
Davis, 0
after 0
defending 0
Farrakhan, 0
now 0
has 0
a 0
statement 0
condemning 0
him. 0

But 1
we've 1
seen 1
that 1
before. 1

So 1
it 1
likely 1
doesn't 1
represent 1
his 1
views. 1

After 0
a 0
previous 0
statement, 0
Rep. 0
Davis 0
made 0
an 0
infamous 0
comment 0
about 0
the 0
"Jewish 0
question". 0

So 0
it 0
probably 0
still 0
isn't 0
over. 0

The 1
statement 1
though 1
is 1
full 1
of 1
conspiracy 1
theories 1
and 1
blames 1
everyone 1
else 1
for 1
Davis' 1
behavior 1
except 1
him. 1

He 1

in 1
a 1
statement 1

to 1
The 1
Daily 1

News 1

on 1
Thursday. 1

“I 1

His 0

2011 0

shrug 0
off 0

Clyburn 0
is 0
now 0
the 0

The 0

the 0
seven 0

Obviously 1
not 1
going 1
to 1
happen. 1

But 0
the 0
story 0
is 0
breaking 0
through 0
the 0
embargo. 0

We're 1
starting 1
to 1
have 1
that 1
"national 1
dialogue" 1
about 1
racism 1
that 1
the 1
left 1
keeps 1
wanting 1
