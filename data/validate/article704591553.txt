with 0 55 1

of 1 55 1

latest 0 55 2
outrage 1 55 2
perpetrated 0 55 2
by 0 55 2
BDS 0 55 2

occurred 0 55 2
at 0 55 2

where 0 55 2
a 0 55 2
Jewish 0 55 2

two 0 55 2
non-Jewish 0 55 2
students 0 55 2
identified 0 55 2
as 0 55 2

At 0 55 3
the 0 55 3
end 0 55 3
of 0 55 3
his 0 55 3
second 0 55 3

Noah 0 55 3

currently 0 55 3

He 1 55 4
was 1 55 4
warned 1 55 4
by 1 55 4
others 1 55 4
who 1 55 4
had 1 55 4
prior 1 55 4
dealings 1 55 4
with 1 55 4
the 1 55 4

to 1 55 4
keep 1 55 4
his 1 55 4
Jewish 1 55 4

lest 1 55 4
he 1 55 4
sabotage 1 55 4
his 1 55 4
chances. 1 55 4

This 0 55 5
is 0 55 5
the 0 55 5
atmosphere 0 55 5
that 0 55 5
Jewish 0 55 5
students 0 55 5
and 0 55 5
supporters 0 55 5
of 0 55 5
Israel 0 55 5

endure 0 55 5
on 0 55 5
a 0 55 5
daily 0 55 5
basis 0 55 5
at 0 55 5
McGill. 0 55 5

The 1 55 6
toxic 1 55 6
environment 1 55 6
is 0 55 6
due 0 55 6
almost 0 55 6
exclusively 0 55 6
to 0 55 6
an 0 55 6
active 0 55 6
and 0 55 6
vocal 0 55 6
presence 0 55 6
of 0 55 6
BDS 1 55 6
agitators 1 55 6
on 0 55 6
campus. 0 55 6

Lew 0 55 7
followed 0 55 7
the 0 55 7
advice 0 55 7
and 0 55 7
was 0 55 7
elected 0 55 7
as 0 55 7
a 0 55 7
board 0 55 7
member. 0 55 7

His 0 55 8
“secret” 0 55 8
was 0 55 8
intact. 0 55 8

BDS 1 55 9
provocateurs 1 55 9
at 0 55 9
McGill 0 55 9
had 0 55 9
relentlessly 0 55 9
tried 0 55 9
and 0 55 9
failed 0 55 9
to 0 55 9
pass 0 55 9
boycott 0 55 9
resolutions 0 55 9
against 0 55 9
Israel. 0 55 9

In 0 55 10
fact, 0 55 10
three 0 55 10
attempts 0 55 10
within 0 55 10
an 0 55 10
18-month 0 55 10
period 0 55 10
were 1 55 10
quashed. 1 55 10

Finally, 0 55 11
in 0 55 11
June 0 55 11
2016, 0 55 11
SSMU’s 0 55 11
Judicial 0 55 11
Board 0 55 11
ruled 0 55 11
that 0 55 11
the 0 55 11

The 0 55 12
Board’s 0 55 12
ruling, 0 55 12
which 0 55 12
is 0 55 12
called 0 55 12
a 0 55 12
“reference,” 0 55 12
was 0 55 12
then 0 55 12
referred 0 55 12
to 0 55 12
SSMU’s 0 55 12
directors 0 55 12
for 0 55 12
ratification. 0 55 12

SSMU’s 0 55 13
Board 0 55 13
of 0 55 13
Directors 0 55 13
addressed 0 55 13
the 0 55 13
issue 0 55 13
more 0 55 13
than 0 55 13
a 0 55 13
year 0 55 13
after 0 55 13
the 0 55 13
“reference.” 0 55 13
Lew 0 55 13
and 0 55 13
other 0 55 13
board 0 55 13
members 0 55 13
passionately 1 55 13
advocated 1 55 13
in 0 55 13
favor 0 55 13
of 0 55 13
ratification 0 55 13
and 0 55 13
their 0 55 13
arguments 0 55 13
ultimately 0 55 13
prevailed 0 55 13
over 0 55 13
the 0 55 13
naysayers. 0 55 13

The 1 55 14
malevolent 1 55 14
BDS 1 55 14
campaign 1 55 14
at 0 55 14
McGill 0 55 14
had 0 55 14
belatedly 0 55 14
come 0 55 14
to 0 55 14
an 0 55 14
ignominious 1 55 14
end; 1 55 14
or 0 55 14
so 0 55 14
we 0 55 14
thought. 0 55 14

Lew 0 55 15
and 0 55 15
two 0 55 15
other 0 55 15
directors 0 55 15
identified 0 55 15
as 0 55 15
either 0 55 15
Jewish 0 55 15
or 0 55 15
pro-Israel 0 55 15
became 0 55 15
instant 0 55 15
targets 0 55 15
of 0 55 15
a 1 55 15
campaign 1 55 15
of 1 55 15
hate 1 55 15
laced 1 55 15
with 1 55 15
blatant 1 55 15
anti-Semitic 1 55 15
overtones. 1 55 15

Campus 0 55 16
BDS 0 55 16
groups 0 55 16
held 0 55 16
several 0 55 16
meetings 0 55 16
to 0 55 16
formulate 0 55 16
a 0 55 16
response 0 55 16
and 0 55 16
founded 0 55 16
the 0 55 16
so-called 0 55 16
“Democratize 0 55 16
SSMU” 0 55 16
movement. 0 55 16

But 1 55 17
Democratize 1 55 17
SSMU 1 55 17
was 1 55 17
anything 1 55 17
but 1 55 17
democratic. 1 55 17

Its 0 55 18
raison 0 55 18
d'être 0 55 18
was 0 55 18
to 0 55 18
seek 0 55 18
the 0 55 18
removal 0 55 18
of 0 55 18

Igor 0 55 19
Sadikov, 0 55 19
who 0 55 19
in 0 55 19
February 0 55 19

advocating 0 55 19
violence 0 55 19

As 0 55 19
a 0 55 19
result, 0 55 19
he 0 55 19
was 0 55 19
forced 0 55 19
to 0 55 19
resign 0 55 19
his 0 55 19
position 0 55 19
as 0 55 19
an 0 55 19
SSMU 0 55 19

dodged 0 55 19
an 0 55 19
impeachment 0 55 19
effort 0 55 19
to 0 55 19
have 0 55 19

Sadikov 0 55 20
made 0 55 20
light 0 55 20
of 0 55 20
his 0 55 20
“punch 1 55 20
a 1 55 20
Zionist” 1 55 20
tweet 0 55 20
calling 0 55 20
it 0 55 20
a 0 55 20
“misguided 1 55 20
joke.” 1 55 20
It 0 55 20
does 0 55 20
not 0 55 20
appear 0 55 20
that 0 55 20
Sadikov 0 55 20
was 0 55 20
subjected 0 55 20

any 0 55 20
form 0 55 20
of 0 55 20

action 0 55 20
despite 0 55 20
the 0 55 20
fact 0 55 20
that 0 55 20
his 0 55 20
call 0 55 20
for 0 55 20
violence 0 55 20
violated 0 55 20
McGill’s 0 55 20
Code 0 55 20

McGill’s 0 55 21

Action 0 55 21
Network 0 55 21
actively 0 55 21
campaigned 0 55 21
against 0 55 21

and 0 55 21
two 0 55 21
other 0 55 21

to 0 55 21

anti-BDS 0 55 21
stances. 0 55 21

Democratize 0 55 22
SSMU 0 55 22
shamefully 1 55 22
highlighted 0 55 22
Lew’s 0 55 22
ethnicity 0 55 22
as 0 55 22
a 0 55 22
reason 0 55 22
for 0 55 22
his 0 55 22
removal. 0 55 22

An 1 55 23
enlightened, 1 55 23
progressive 1 55 23
school 1 55 23
was 1 55 23
suddenly 1 55 23
transformed 1 55 23
into 1 55 23
something 1 55 23
harking 1 55 23
back 1 55 23
to 1 55 23
the 1 55 23
days 1 55 23
of 1 55 23
Nazi 1 55 23
Germany 1 55 23
and 1 55 23
the 1 55 23
Nuremberg 1 55 23
Laws. 1 55 23

In 0 55 24
October, 0 55 24
SSMU’s 0 55 24
General 0 55 24
Assembly 0 55 24
moved 0 55 24
to 0 55 24
ratify 0 55 24
the 0 55 24
12-member 0 55 24
Board 0 55 24
of 0 55 24
Directors. 0 55 24

According 0 55 25
to 0 55 25
Lew, 0 55 25
“historically, 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
Board 0 55 25
of 0 55 25
Directors 0 55 25
had 0 55 25
been 0 55 25
ratified 0 55 25
as 0 55 25
a 0 55 25

all 0 55 25
12 0 55 25
at 0 55 25
a 0 55 25
time.” 0 55 25
But 0 55 25
BDS 0 55 25
activists 0 55 25
who 0 55 25
showed 0 55 25
up 0 55 25
for 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
General 0 55 25
Assembly 0 55 25
ratification 0 55 25
forced 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
voting 0 55 25
to 0 55 25
occur 0 55 25
on 0 55 25
an 0 55 25
individual 0 55 25
basis 0 55 25
rather 0 55 25
than 0 55 25
a 0 55 25
block 0 55 25
as 0 55 25
was 0 55 25
the 0 55 25
accepted 0 55 25
protocol. 0 55 25

In 0 55 26
this 0 55 26
manner, 0 55 26
BDS/ 0 55 26
Democratize 0 55 26
SSMU 0 55 26
activists 0 55 26
managed 0 55 26
to 0 55 26
pick 0 55 26
off 0 55 26
their 0 55 26
opponents 0 55 26
one 0 55 26
at 0 55 26
a 0 55 26
time. 0 55 26

It 0 55 27
was 0 55 27
repulsive 1 55 27
display 1 55 27
leftist-fascist 1 55 27
bigotry 1 55 27
at 1 55 27
its 1 55 27
worst. 1 55 27

The 1 55 28
bigoted 1 55 28
BDS 1 55 28
provocateurs 1 55 28
applauded 0 55 28
as 0 55 28
Lew 0 55 28
and 0 55 28
the 0 55 28
other 0 55 28
two 0 55 28
board 0 55 28
members 0 55 28
were 0 55 28
removed 0 55 28
from 0 55 28
their 0 55 28
posts. 0 55 28

But 0 55 29
this 0 55 29
time, 0 55 29
they 0 55 29
may 0 55 29
have 0 55 29
gone 0 55 29
too 0 55 29
far. 0 55 29

Even 0 55 30
by 0 55 30
BDS 0 55 30
standards, 0 55 30
their 1 55 30
manifestly 1 55 30
anti-Semitic 1 55 30
campaign 1 55 30
antics 1 55 30
were 1 55 30
beyond 1 55 30
the 1 55 30
pale. 1 55 30

BDS 0 55 31
activists 0 55 31
generally 0 55 31
avoid 0 55 31
reference 0 55 31
to 0 55 31
“Jews” 0 55 31
by 0 55 31
name 0 55 31
because 0 55 31
it 0 55 31
is 0 55 31
impolitic 0 55 31
and 0 55 31
commonly 0 55 31
substitute 0 55 31
“Zionists” 0 55 31
for 0 55 31
Jews 0 55 31
even 0 55 31
though 0 55 31
most 0 55 31
of 0 55 31
us 0 55 31
are 0 55 31
cognizant 0 55 31
of 0 55 31
their 0 55 31
true 0 55 31
intentions. 0 55 31

But 0 55 32
in 0 55 32
the 0 55 32
instant 0 55 32
case, 0 55 32
McGill’s 0 55 32
BDS 0 55 32
campaigners 0 55 32
dispensed 0 55 32
with 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
traditional 0 55 32
charade 1 55 32
and 0 55 32
overtly 0 55 32
launched 0 55 32
their 0 55 32
attack 0 55 32
against 0 55 32
Jews. 0 55 32

The 1 55 33
vitriolic 1 55 33
BDS 1 55 33
campaign 1 55 33
immediately 0 55 33
sparked 1 55 33
outrage 1 55 33
among 0 55 33
watchdog 0 55 33
groups 0 55 33
and 0 55 33
politicians 0 55 33
prompting 0 55 33
McGill 0 55 33
principal, 0 55 33
Suzanne 0 55 33
Fortier, 0 55 33
to 0 55 33
announce 0 55 33
that 0 55 33
the 0 55 33

an 0 55 33

Even 0 55 34
