rush 1
to 0
the 0
desert 0
kingdom 0
to 0
try 0
to 0
determine 0
the 0
fate 0
of 0
the 0
missing 0
journalist, 0
Jamal 0
Khashoggi, 0
and 0
the 0
diplomat 0
quickly 0
hopped 1
a 0
plane. 0

In 0
his 0
meetings, 0
Pompeo 0
conveyed 0
“U.S. 0

concern” 0
about 0
Khashoggi’s 0
disappearance 0
two 0
weeks 0
ago, 0
the 0
State 0
Department 0
said, 0
and 0
stressed 0
“the 0
importance 0
of 0
a 0
thorough, 0
transparent, 0
and 0
timely 0
investigation.” 0

The 0
talks 0
were 0
“direct 0
and 0
candid,” 0
State 0
Department 0
spokeswoman 0
Heather 0
Nauert 0
said. 0

Pompeo 0
reminded 0
his 0
hosts 0
that 0
despite 0
the 0
numerous 0
bilateral 0
issues 0
the 0
two 0
governments 0
share, 0
determining 0
Khashoggi’s 0
fate 0
was 0
the 0
urgent 0
purpose 0
of 0
this 0
trip, 0
she 0
said. 0

Khashoggi, 0
a 0
prominent 0
critic 0
of 0
the 0
autocratic 0
Saudi 0
leadership, 0
was 0
last 0
seen 0
entering 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Consulate 0
in 0
Istanbul, 0
Turkey, 0
on 0
Oct. 0
2, 0
where 0
he 0
was 0
seeking 0
papers 0
to 0
marry 0
his 0
fiancée. 0

Turkish 0
media 0
reports, 0
based 0
in 0
part 0
on 0
apparent 0
audio 0
recordings, 0
have 0
said 0
Khashoggi 0
was 0
beaten 1
to 1
death 1
and 1
then 1
dismembered 1
in 0
the 0
building. 0

A 0
15-member 0
Saudi 0
military 0
team 0
had 0
entered 0
the 0
consulate 0
with 0
a 0
bone 0
saw 0
shortly 0
before 0
Khashoggi 0
arrived, 0
and 0
flew 0
out 0
of 0
the 0
country 0
soon 0
after, 0
the 0
reports 0
said. 0

Saudi 0
officials 0
insisted 0
that 0
Khashoggi 0
left 0
the 0
consulate 0
but 0
have 0
provided 0
no 0
video 0
or 0
other 0
evidence. 0

They 0
have 0
denied 0
any 0
responsibility 0
for 0
his 0
disappearance. 0

Hoping 0
to 0
stem 0
a 0
growing 0
furor, 0
Trump 0
on 0
Monday 0
suggested 0
“rogue 0
killers,” 0
not 0
the 0
Saudi 0
royal 0
family, 0
may 0
have 0
carried 0
out 0
the 0
murder. 0

Critics 0
quickly 0
said 0
that 0
Trump 0
was 0
providing 0
an 0
excuse 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
leaders, 0
and 0
participating 0
in 0
a 0
cover-up. 0

That 0
seemed 0
to 0
set 0
the 0
stage 0
for 0
Saudi 0
officials 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
way 0
to 0
explain 0
away 0
the 0
alleged 0
shocking 1
death. 1

They 0
floated 0
the 0
idea 0
later 0
Monday 0
of 0
claiming 0
that 0
Khashoggi, 0
who 0
wrote 0
opinion 0
pieces 0
for 0
the 0
Washington 0
Post 0
and 0
Arab 0
media, 0
was 0
accidentally 0
killed 0
in 0
an 0
interrogation 0
gone 0
awry 0
inside 0
the 0
consulate 0
— 0
supposedly 0
without 0
the 0
approval 0
of 0
the 0
king 0
or 0
crown 0
prince. 0

Publicly, 0
Pompeo 0
and 0
his 0
hosts 0
looked 0
calm 0
and 0
friendly 0
when 0
they 0
met 0
Tuesday 0
in 0
Riyadh. 0

At 0
one 0
point, 0
as 0
they 0
greeted 0
each 0
other, 0
Prince 0
Mohammed 0
noted 0
the 0
two 0
countries 0
were 0
important 0
allies. 0

“Absolutely,” 0
Pompeo 0
said, 0
smiling. 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
long 0
guaranteed 0
Saudi 0
security 0
in 0
exchange 0
for 0
a 0
steady 0
supply 0
of 0
oil. 0

Those 0
ties 0
have 0
frayed 0
even 0
as 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
embraced 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers 0
as 0
a 0
crucial 0
regional 0
ally 0
in 0
efforts 0
to 0
constrain 0
Iran 0
and 0
to 0
craft 0
a 0
peace 0
plan 0
between 0
Israel 0
and 0
the 0
Palestinians. 0

The 0
current 0
crisis 0
has 0
put 0
those 0
broader 0
goals 0
at 0
risk, 0
and 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
has 0
scrambled 0
to 0
find 0
a 0
face-saving 0
solution 0
for 0
the 0
Saudi 0
rulers. 0

Trump 0
has 0
said 0
he 0
would 0
impose 0
“severe” 1
punishment 0
if 0
proof 0
emerges 0
that 0
Saudi 0
rulers 0
sanctioned 0
Khashoggi’s 0
murder, 0
but 0
he 0
has 0
not 0
said 0
what 0
that 0
would 0
entail. 0

He 0
has 0
ruled 0
out 0
cancelling 0
or 0
suspending 0
billions 0
of 0
dollars 0
in 0
arms 0
deals 0
with 0
the 0
oil-rich 0
country. 0

Many 0
members 0
of 0
Congress 0
have 0
demanded 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
take 0
tougher 0
actions, 0
including 0
punitive 0
sanctions 0
on 0
Saudi 0
rulers. 0

But 0
Congress 0
has 0
taken 0
no 0
action 0
on 0
its 0
own. 0
