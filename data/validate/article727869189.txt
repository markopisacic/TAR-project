Assessing 0 22 4

Five 0 22 4
Years 0 22 4
after 0 22 4
His 0 22 4
Election.” 0 22 4
As 0 22 4
I 0 22 4
made 0 22 4
my 0 22 4
way 0 22 4
up 0 22 4
to 0 22 4
Fordham 0 22 4
University, 0 22 4
I 0 22 4
was 0 22 4
excited. 0 22 4

Having 0 22 5
followed 0 22 5
Douthat 0 22 5
and 0 22 5
Faggioli’s 0 22 5
ongoing 0 22 5
dialogue 0 22 5
on 0 22 5

knew 0 22 5
I 0 22 5
was 0 22 5
in 0 22 5
for 0 22 5
a 0 22 5
lively, 0 22 5
if 0 22 5
predictable, 0 22 5
conversation. 0 22 5

In 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
opening 0 22 6
remarks, 0 22 6
Douthat 0 22 6
laid 0 22 6
out 0 22 6
three 0 22 6
criteria 0 22 6
that 0 22 6
can 0 22 6
be 0 22 6
used 0 22 6
to 0 22 6
evaluate 0 22 6
Francis’s 0 22 6
papacy 0 22 6
thus 0 22 6
far: 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
impact 0 22 6
on 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
public’s 0 22 6
perception 0 22 6
of 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
Church 0 22 6
(a 0 22 6
success); 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
attempts 0 22 6
at 0 22 6
reforming 0 22 6
the 0 22 6
Vatican 0 22 6
bureaucracy 0 22 6
(a 0 22 6
disappointment); 0 22 6
and 0 22 6
his 0 22 6
position 0 22 6
on 0 22 6
“moral-theological 0 22 6
controversies,” 0 22 6
specifically, 0 22 6

Faggioli, 0 22 9
meanwhile, 0 22 9
outlined 0 22 9
a 1 22 9
genuinely 1 22 9
surprising 1 22 9
position. 1 22 9

Rather 0 22 10
than 0 22 10
making 0 22 10
a 0 22 10
straightforward 0 22 10
case 0 22 10
for 0 22 10
why 0 22 10
Pope 0 22 10
Francis 0 22 10
has 0 22 10
changed 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
Church 0 22 10
for 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
better, 0 22 10
Faggioli 0 22 10
rejected 0 22 10
the 0 22 10
possibility 0 22 10
of 0 22 10
evaluating 0 22 10
his 0 22 10
papacy 0 22 10
in 0 22 10
terms 0 22 10
of 0 22 10
“continuity” 0 22 10
with 0 22 10
past 0 22 10
popes, 0 22 10
since 0 22 10
doing 0 22 10
so 0 22 10
would 0 22 10
assume 0 22 10
that 0 22 10
“Christianity 0 22 10
at 0 22 10
some 0 22 10
point 0 22 10
. 0 22 10

. 0 22 11

. 0 22 12

was 0 22 13
complete,” 0 22 13
which 0 22 13
Faggioli 0 22 13
does 0 22 13
not 0 22 13
think 0 22 13
is 0 22 13
true. 0 22 13

While 0 22 14
I 0 22 14
emphatically 0 22 14
disagree 0 22 14
with 0 22 14
this 0 22 14
argument, 0 22 14
I 0 22 14
have 0 22 14
to 0 22 14
hand 0 22 14
it 0 22 14
to 0 22 14
Faggioli: 0 22 14
From 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
outset, 0 22 14
he 0 22 14
made 0 22 14
clear 0 22 14
that 0 22 14
he 0 22 14
was 0 22 14
not 0 22 14
planning 0 22 14
to 0 22 14
debate 0 22 14
Douthat 0 22 14
on 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
implications 0 22 14
of 0 22 14
the 0 22 14
Francis 0 22 14
papacy. 0 22 14

Instead, 0 22 15
through 0 22 15
a 1 22 15
combination 1 22 15
of 1 22 15
rhetorical 1 22 15
tricks 1 22 15
and 1 22 15
soft-peddled 1 22 15
Hegelianism, 1 22 15
he 0 22 15
would 0 22 15
completely 0 22 15
redefine 0 22 15
the 0 22 15
role 0 22 15
and 0 22 15
nature 0 22 15
of 0 22 15
the 0 22 15
Catholic 0 22 15
Church. 0 22 15

During 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
crux 0 22 16
of 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
debate 0 22 16
— 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
discussion 0 22 16
of 0 22 16
communion 0 22 16
for 0 22 16
the 0 22 16
divorced 0 22 16
and 0 22 16
remarried 0 22 16
— 0 22 16
Faggioli 0 22 16
raised 0 22 16
his 1 22 16
most 1 22 16
theologically 1 22 16
unsettling 1 22 16
point. 1 22 16

To 0 22 17
defend 0 22 17
his 0 22 17
position 0 22 17
that 0 22 17
remarried 0 22 17
persons 0 22 17
should 0 22 17
be 0 22 17
able 0 22 17
to 0 22 17
receive 0 22 17
communion, 0 22 17
Faggioli 0 22 17
invoked 0 22 17
the 0 22 17
case 0 22 17
of 0 22 17
Germany, 0 22 17
where 0 22 17
50 0 22 17
percent 0 22 17
of 0 22 17
Catholic 0 22 17
marriages 0 22 17
end 0 22 17
in 0 22 17
divorce. 0 22 17

For 1 22 18
Faggioli, 1 22 18
the 1 22 18
implication 1 22 18
is 1 22 18
that 1 22 18
at 1 22 18
least 1 22 18
50 1 22 18
percent 1 22 18
of 1 22 18
German 1 22 18
Catholic 1 22 18
children 1 22 18
never 1 22 18
see 1 22 18
their 1 22 18
parents 1 22 18
receive 1 22 18
communion 1 22 18
and 1 22 18
lose 1 22 18
their 1 22 18
faith 1 22 18
because 1 22 18
of 1 22 18
it. 1 22 18

This, 0 22 19
he 0 22 19
says, 0 22 19
is 0 22 19
“bad 1 22 19
for 1 22 19
evangelization,” 1 22 19
and 0 22 19
in 0 22 19
order 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
keep 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
pews 0 22 19
full, 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
Church’s 0 22 19
role 0 22 19
should 0 22 19
not 0 22 19
be 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
deny 0 22 19
communion 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
divorced 0 22 19
and 0 22 19
remarried, 0 22 19
but 0 22 19
instead 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
ask, 0 22 19
“What 0 22 19
can 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
Catholic 0 22 19
Church 0 22 19
do 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
make 0 22 19
the 0 22 19
faithful 0 22 19
able 0 22 19
to 0 22 19
receive 0 22 19
sacraments?” 0 22 19

Advertisement 0 22 20

This 0 22 21
is 0 22 21
a 1 22 21
lovely 1 22 21
suggestion, 1 22 21
and 0 22 21
one 0 22 21
that 0 22 21
I’m 0 22 21
not 0 22 21
entirely 0 22 21
unsympathetic 0 22 21
to. 0 22 21

However, 0 22 22
the 0 22 22
fact 0 22 22
remains 0 22 22
that 0 22 22
Faggioli 0 22 22
is 0 22 22
suggesting 0 22 22
the 0 22 22
Church 0 22 22
do 0 22 22
much 0 22 22
more 0 22 22
than 0 22 22
provide 0 22 22
sacraments 0 22 22
to 0 22 22
the 0 22 22
faithful. 0 22 22

Just 0 22 23
before 0 22 23
invoking 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
German 0 22 23
case, 0 22 23
Faggioli 0 22 23
characterized 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
country 0 22 23
as 0 22 23
one 0 22 23
of 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
most 0 22 23
secular 0 22 23
in 0 22 23
the 0 22 23
world. 0 22 23

But 0 22 24
rather 0 22 24
than 0 22 24
lamenting 0 22 24
what 0 22 24
secularism 0 22 24
has 0 22 24
wrought 0 22 24
on 0 22 24
marital 0 22 24
life 0 22 24
in 0 22 24
Germany, 0 22 24
reasserting 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
Church’s 0 22 24
position 0 22 24
on 0 22 24
marriage, 0 22 24
and 0 22 24
insisting 0 22 24
that 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
faithful 0 22 24
strive 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
live 0 22 24
according 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
her 0 22 24
laws, 0 22 24
Faggioli 0 22 24
argues 0 22 24
that 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
Church 0 22 24
ought 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
bend 0 22 24
to 0 22 24
the 0 22 24
will 0 22 24
of 0 22 24
secular 0 22 24
society. 0 22 24

It 0 22 26
should 0 22 26
be 0 22 26
clear 0 22 26
to 0 22 26
anyone, 0 22 26
not 0 22 26
just 0 22 26
practicing 0 22 26
Catholics, 0 22 26
that 0 22 26
this 0 22 26
is 0 22 26
absurd. 0 22 26

If 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Church 0 22 27
exists 0 22 27
simply 0 22 27
to 0 22 27
accommodate 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
whims 0 22 27
and 0 22 27
failures 0 22 27
of 0 22 27
secular 0 22 27
modernity, 0 22 27
then 0 22 27
what 0 22 27
is 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
point 0 22 27
of 0 22 27
the 0 22 27
Church? 0 22 27

Pope 0 22 28
Benedict 0 22 28
XVI 0 22 28
has 0 22 28
warned 0 22 28
against 0 22 28
precisely 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
kind 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
“accommodation” 0 22 28
Faggioli 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
calling 0 22 28
for, 0 22 28
writing 0 22 28
that 0 22 28
when 0 22 28
“the 0 22 28
people 0 22 28
cannot 0 22 28
cope” 0 22 28
with 0 22 28
God, 0 22 28
they 0 22 28
“bring 0 22 28
him 0 22 28
down 0 22 28
into 0 22 28
their 0 22 28
own 0 22 28
world,” 0 22 28
and 0 22 28
insist 0 22 28
that 0 22 28
“he 0 22 28
must 0 22 28
be 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
kind 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
God 0 22 28
that 0 22 28
[they 0 22 28
need].” 0 22 28
In 0 22 28
other 0 22 28
words, 0 22 28
“Man 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
using 0 22 28
God, 0 22 28
and, 0 22 28
in 0 22 28
reality, 0 22 28
even 0 22 28
if 0 22 28
it 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
not 0 22 28
outwardly 0 22 28
discernible, 0 22 28
he 0 22 28
is 0 22 28
placing 0 22 28
himself 0 22 28
above 0 22 28
God.” 0 22 28
To 0 22 28
fully 0 22 28
drive 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
point 0 22 28
home, 0 22 28
Benedict 0 22 28
equates 0 22 28
this 0 22 28
kind 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
worship 0 22 28
with 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
Israelites 0 22 28
desert 0 22 28
worship 0 22 28
of 0 22 28
the 0 22 28
bull 0 22 28
calf. 0 22 28

Unsurprisingly, 0 22 29
this 0 22 29
progressive 0 22 29
interpretation 0 22 29
of 0 22 29
Catholic 0 22 29
doctrine 0 22 29
eventually 0 22 29
reveals 0 22 29
itself 0 22 29
to 0 22 29
be 0 22 29
rank 1 22 29
historicism. 1 22 29

Throughout 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
debate, 0 22 30
Faggioli 0 22 30
drew 0 22 30
out 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
argument 0 22 30
that 0 22 30
allowing 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
remarried 0 22 30
to 0 22 30
receive 0 22 30
communion 0 22 30
would 0 22 30
not 0 22 30
represent 0 22 30
a 0 22 30
radical 0 22 30
change 0 22 30
in 0 22 30
doctrine 0 22 30
but 0 22 30
a 0 22 30
return 0 22 30
to 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
teachings 0 22 30
of 0 22 30
the 0 22 30
Gospel. 0 22 30

Eventually, 0 22 31
Douthat 0 22 31
drew 0 22 31
his 0 22 31
argument 0 22 31
to 0 22 31
its 0 22 31
logical 0 22 31
conclusion 0 22 31
with 0 22 31
this 0 22 31
question: 0 22 31
Were 1 22 31
priests 1 22 31
throughout 1 22 31
history 1 22 31
in 1 22 31
fact 1 22 31
misleading 1 22 31
their 1 22 31
divorced 1 22 31
and 1 22 31
remarried 1 22 31
parishioners 1 22 31
by 1 22 31
telling 1 22 31
them 1 22 31
they 1 22 31
could 1 22 31
not 1 22 31
receive 1 22 31
communion? 1 22 31

After 0 22 32
a 0 22 32
few 0 22 32
seconds’ 0 22 32
pause, 0 22 32
Faggioli 0 22 32
gave 0 22 32
the 0 22 32
only 0 22 32
answer 0 22 32
he 0 22 32
could: 0 22 32
“There 1 22 32
are 1 22 32
different 1 22 32
responses 1 22 32
to 1 22 32
the 1 22 32
same 1 22 32
question 1 22 32
in 1 22 32
different 1 22 32
times.” 1 22 32

conversation, 0 22 34
both 0 22 34
Douthat 0 22 34

Faggioli 0 22 34

the 0 22 34
debate 0 22 34
over 0 22 34

the 0 22 34
future 0 22 34
of 0 22 34
the 0 22 34
Church 0 22 34
is 0 22 34
carried 0 22 34
on 0 22 34
primarily 0 22 34
among 0 22 34
Catholic 0 22 34
intellectuals, 0 22 34
unbeknownst 0 22 34
to 0 22 34
most 0 22 34
of 0 22 34
“the 0 22 34
flock.” 0 22 34

It 0 22 36
strikes 0 22 36
me, 0 22 36
however, 0 22 36
that 0 22 36
everybody 0 22 36
— 0 22 36
Catholic 0 22 36
or 0 22 36
not 0 22 36
— 0 22 36
has 1 22 36
a 1 22 36
dog 1 22 36
in 1 22 36
this 1 22 36
fight, 1 22 36
which 0 22 36
is 0 22 36
about 0 22 36
more 0 22 36
than 0 22 36
communion 0 22 36
and 0 22 36
canon 0 22 36
law. 0 22 36

At 0 22 37
its 0 22 37
core, 0 22 37
this 0 22 37
debate 0 22 37
is 0 22 37
about 0 22 37
truth 0 22 37
and 0 22 37
our 0 22 37
ability 0 22 37
to 0 22 37
judge 0 22 37
right 0 22 37
from 0 22 37
wrong. 0 22 37

Could 1 22 38
we 1 22 38
possibly 1 22 38
say, 1 22 38
for 1 22 38
instance, 1 22 38
that 1 22 38
it’s 1 22 38
impossible 1 22 38
to 1 22 38
judge 1 22 38
the 1 22 38
presidency 1 22 38
of 1 22 38
Donald 1 22 38
Trump 1 22 38
relative 1 22 38
to 1 22 38
past 1 22 38
presidents? 1 22 38

Of 0 22 39
course 0 22 39
not 0 22 39
— 0 22 39
that 0 22 39
would 0 22 39
be 0 22 39
preposterous, 0 22 39
as 0 22 39
I’m 0 22 39
sure 0 22 39
Faggioli 0 22 39
would 0 22 39
agree. 0 22 39

To 0 22 40
pass 0 22 40
moral 0 22 40
judgements 0 22 40
on 0 22 40
papacies, 0 22 40
presidencies, 0 22 40
or 0 22 40
anything 0 22 40
else, 0 22 40
we 0 22 40
must 0 22 40
have 0 22 40
recourse 0 22 40
to 0 22 40
truth, 0 22 40
and 0 22 40
to 0 22 40
the 0 22 40
institutions 0 22 40
that 0 22 40
have 0 22 40
upheld 0 22 40
this 0 22 40
truth 0 22 40
for 0 22 40
centuries. 0 22 40

Whether 0 22 41
in 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
Church 0 22 41
or 0 22 41
in 0 22 41
the 0 22 41
academy, 0 22 41
we 0 22 41
must 0 22 41
resist 0 22 41
this 0 22 41
dangerous 0 22 41
historicist 0 22 41
impulse. 0 22 41

If 1 22 42
we 1 22 42
don’t, 1 22 42
we 1 22 42
will 1 22 42
find 1 22 42
ourselves, 1 22 42
in 1 22 42
the 1 22 42
words 1 22 42
of 1 22 42
Pope 1 22 42
Benedict, 1 22 42
in 1 22 42
“a 1 22 42
dictatorship 1 22 42
of 1 22 42
relativism 1 22 42
that 1 22 42
does 1 22 42
not 1 22 42
recognize 1 22 42
anything 1 22 42
as 1 22 42
definitive 1 22 42
and 1 22 42
whose 1 22 42
ultimate 1 22 42
goal 1 22 42
consists 1 22 42
solely 1 22 42
of 1 22 42
one’s 1 22 42
own 1 22 42
ego 1 22 42
and 1 22 42
desires.” 1 22 42
