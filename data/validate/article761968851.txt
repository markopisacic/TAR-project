December 0
marked 0
the 0
fifth 0
month 0
in 0
a 0
row 0
in 0
which 0
the 0
immigrant 0
working-age 0
population 0
( 0
legal 0
and 0
illegal 0
declined 0
from 0
the 0
same 0
month 0
of 0
the 0
prior 0
year. 0

Simultaneously, 0
immigrant 0
displacement 0
of 0
American 0
workers 0
fell, 0
also 0
apparently 0
confirming 0
a 0
trend 0
that 0
began 0
in 0
September. 0

And, 0
by 0
the 0
way, 0
black 0

is 0
at 0
a 0
record 0
low. 0

What 0
started 0
after 0
the 0
2016 0
election 0
as 0
a 0
reduction 0
in 0
the 0
rate 0
of 0
increase 0
in 0
the 0
foreign-born 0
population 0
of 0
working 0
age 0
has 0
turned 0
into 0
an 1
outright 1
retreat. 1

This 0
is 0
in 0
dramatic 1
contrast 1
to 0
the 0
last 0
months 0
of 0
the 0
Obama 0
Regime, 0
which 0
saw 0
year-over-year 0
increases 0
in 0
immigrant 0
working-age 0
population 0
far 0
in 0
excess 0
of 0
the 0
estimated 0
1 0
million 0
legal 0
immigrants 0
admitted 0
annually, 0
and 1
which 1
I 1
argued 1
meant 1
that 1
an 1
unreported 1
illegal 1
alien 1
surge 1
was 1
underway. 1

According 0
to 0
the 0
Labor 0
Department 0
employment 0
report 0
released 0
last 0
Friday, 0
December 0
there 0
were 0
77,000 0

working-age 0
immigrants 0
(legal 0

in 0
the 0
country 0
in 0
December 0
2017 0
than 0
in 0
December 0
2016—a 0
decline 0
of 0
0.18%. 0

This 0
follows 0
year-over-year 0
drops 0
of 0
138,000 0
in 0
August, 0
143,000 0

Not 0
since 0
the 0
Great 0
Recession 0
has 0
the 0
foreign-born 0

declined 0
for 0
five 0
consecutive 0
months—but 0
now, 0
in 0
telling 0

the 0
economy 0
is 0
expanding. 0

This 0
makes 0
the 0
Trump 0

immigrant 0
workforce 0
decline 0
especially 1
striking. 1

Note 0
that 0
this 0
is 0

figure. 0

The 0
year-over- 0
year 0
reduction 0
in 0
the 0
immigrant 0

population 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
new 0

have 0
stopped 0
coming 0
in. 0

About 0
300,000 0
