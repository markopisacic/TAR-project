John 0 32 1
Kerry 0 32 1
wasted 0 32 1
no 0 32 1
time 0 32 1
condemning 0 32 1
President 0 32 1
Trump’s 0 32 1
decision 0 32 1
not 0 32 1
to 0 32 1
recertify, 0 32 1
and 0 32 1
to 0 32 1
possibly 0 32 1
withdraw 0 32 1
from, 0 32 1
the 0 32 1
disastrous 1 32 1
nuclear 1 32 1
deal 1 32 1
with 0 32 1
Iran 0 32 1
that 0 32 1
Kerry 0 32 1
negotiated 0 32 1
on 0 32 1
behalf 0 32 1
of 0 32 1
his 0 32 1
boss 0 32 1
Barack 0 32 1
Obama. 0 32 1

President 0 32 2
Trump 0 32 2
insisted 0 32 2
on 0 32 2
significant 0 32 2
improvements 0 32 2
to 0 32 2
the 0 32 2
Joint 0 32 2
Plan 0 32 2
of 0 32 2
Comprehensive 0 32 2
Action 0 32 2
(JCPOA), 0 32 2
as 0 32 2
the 0 32 2
deal 0 32 2
is 0 32 2
formally 0 32 2
known. 0 32 2

The 0 32 3
JCPOA’s 0 32 3
fundamental 0 32 3
flaws 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
President 0 32 3
Trump 0 32 3
wants 0 32 3
fixed 0 32 3
include 0 32 3
Iran’s 0 32 3
ability 0 32 3
to 0 32 3
block 0 32 3
unfettered 0 32 3
international 0 32 3
inspections, 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
wiggle 0 32 3
room 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
Iran 0 32 3
is 0 32 3
exploiting 0 32 3
to 0 32 3
continue 0 32 3
developing 0 32 3
and 0 32 3
testing 0 32 3
ballistic 0 32 3
missiles 0 32 3
capable 0 32 3
of 0 32 3
delivering 0 32 3
nuclear 0 32 3
weapons, 0 32 3
and 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
sunset 0 32 3
clause 0 32 3
on 0 32 3
nuclear 0 32 3
enrichment 0 32 3
that 0 32 3
would 0 32 3
provide 0 32 3
Iran 0 32 3
a 0 32 3
clear 0 32 3
path 0 32 3
to 0 32 3
becoming 0 32 3
a 0 32 3
nuclear 0 32 3
armed 0 32 3
state 0 32 3
after 0 32 3
the 0 32 3
current 0 32 3
restrictions 0 32 3
are 0 32 3
lifted. 0 32 3

Obama 0 32 4
and 0 32 4
Kerry 0 32 4
had 0 32 4
promised 0 32 4
that 0 32 4
these 0 32 4
issues 0 32 4
would 0 32 4
be 0 32 4
dealt 0 32 4
with 0 32 4
satisfactorily 0 32 4
before 0 32 4
agreeing 0 32 4
to 0 32 4
the 0 32 4
final 0 32 4
terms 0 32 4
of 0 32 4
the 0 32 4
JCPOA. 0 32 4

Instead 0 32 5
they 0 32 5
caved 0 32 5
to 0 32 5
Iranian 0 32 5
pressure 0 32 5
in 0 32 5
order 0 32 5
to 0 32 5
get 0 32 5
the 0 32 5
deal 0 32 5
done. 0 32 5

Now 0 32 6
that 0 32 6
President 0 32 6
Trump 0 32 6
is 0 32 6
trying 1 32 6
to 1 32 6
clean 1 32 6
up 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
mess 1 32 6
Obama 0 32 6
and 0 32 6
Kerry 0 32 6
left 0 32 6
him, 0 32 6
Kerry 0 32 6
has 0 32 6
the 0 32 6
gall 0 32 6
to 0 32 6
label 0 32 6
President 0 32 6
Trump’s 0 32 6
decision 0 32 6
a 0 32 6
"reckless 1 32 6
abandonment 1 32 6
of 1 32 6
facts 1 32 6
in 1 32 6
favor 1 32 6
of 1 32 6
ego 1 32 6
and 1 32 6
ideology" 1 32 6
and 0 32 6
to 0 32 6
accuse 0 32 6
the 0 32 6
Trump 0 32 6
administration 0 32 6
of 0 32 6
“lying 1 32 6
to 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
American 1 32 6
people.” 1 32 6
It 1 32 6
was 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
Obama 1 32 6
administration 1 32 6
that 1 32 6
recklessly 1 32 6
abandoned 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
facts 1 32 6
in 1 32 6
pressing 1 32 6
ahead 1 32 6
with 1 32 6
the 1 32 6
deal. 1 32 6

The 1 32 7
Obama 1 32 7
administration 1 32 7
lied 1 32 7
to 1 32 7
the 1 32 7
American 1 32 7
people, 1 32 7
abandoning 0 32 7
its 0 32 7
own 0 32 7
promises 0 32 7
to 0 32 7
ensure 0 32 7
that 0 32 7
the 0 32 7
deal 0 32 7
contained 0 32 7
ironclad 0 32 7
protections. 0 32 7

Moreover, 0 32 8
all 0 32 8
that 0 32 8
President 0 32 8
Trump 0 32 8
has 0 32 8
done 0 32 8
so 0 32 8
far 0 32 8
is 0 32 8
to 0 32 8
return 0 32 8
the 0 32 8
JCPOA 0 32 8
to 0 32 8
Congress 0 32 8
for 0 32 8
review. 0 32 8

Had 0 32 9
Obama 0 32 9
followed 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
Constitution 0 32 9
and 0 32 9
submitted 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
JCPOA 0 32 9
to 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
Senate 0 32 9
as 0 32 9
a 0 32 9
treaty 0 32 9
in 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
first 0 32 9
place, 0 32 9
the 0 32 9
JCPOA 0 32 9
in 0 32 9
its 0 32 9
present 0 32 9
form 0 32 9
almost 0 32 9
certainly 0 32 9
would 0 32 9
not 0 32 9
have 0 32 9
been 0 32 9
approved. 0 32 9

Congress 0 32 10
should 0 32 10
now 0 32 10
have 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
opportunity 0 32 10
to 0 32 10
revisit 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
JCPOA 0 32 10
to 0 32 10
determine 0 32 10
whether 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
protections 0 32 10
that 0 32 10
the 0 32 10
Obama 0 32 10
administration 0 32 10
promised 0 32 10
are 0 32 10
working 0 32 10
as 0 32 10
advertised. 0 32 10

Congress 0 32 11
should 0 32 11
also 0 32 11
consider 0 32 11
whether 0 32 11
time 0 32 11
limits 0 32 11
on 0 32 11
Iran’s 0 32 11
commitments 0 32 11
continue 0 32 11
to 0 32 11
make 0 32 11
sense 0 32 11
in 0 32 11
light 0 32 11
of 0 32 11
what 0 32 11
we 0 32 11
are 0 32 11
now 0 32 11
experiencing 0 32 11
with 0 32 11
Iran’s 0 32 11
nuclear 0 32 11
technology 0 32 11
collaborator, 0 32 11
North 0 32 11
Korea. 0 32 11

It 0 32 12
bought 0 32 12
time 0 32 12
to 0 32 12
turn 0 32 12
into 0 32 12
a 0 32 12
full-fledged 0 32 12
nuclear 0 32 12
power 0 32 12
under 0 32 12
our 0 32 12
noses. 0 32 12

Kerry 0 32 13
had 0 32 13
promised 0 32 13
that 0 32 13
the 0 32 13
Iranian 0 32 13
regime 0 32 13
would 0 32 13
be 0 32 13
prohibited 0 32 13
from 0 32 13
testing 0 32 13
ballistic 0 32 13
missiles. 0 32 13

This 0 32 14
turned 0 32 14
out 0 32 14
to 0 32 14
be 0 32 14
a 0 32 14
lie. 0 32 14

After 0 32 15
the 0 32 15
JCPOA 0 32 15
was 0 32 15
finalized, 0 32 15
with 0 32 15
no 0 32 15
such 0 32 15
prohibition 0 32 15
included, 0 32 15
Iran 0 32 15
continued 0 32 15
to 0 32 15
test 0 32 15
such 0 32 15
missiles. 0 32 15

The 0 32 16
Obama 0 32 16
administration’s 0 32 16
response 0 32 16
was 0 32 16
that 0 32 16
the 0 32 16
missiles 0 32 16
had 0 32 16
become 0 32 16
a 0 32 16
separate 0 32 16
issue, 0 32 16
to 0 32 16
be 0 32 16
dealt 0 32 16
with 0 32 16
under 0 32 16
a 0 32 16
new 0 32 16
United 0 32 16

Council 0 32 16
resolution 0 32 16

the 0 32 16
JCPOA. 0 32 16

The 0 32 17
new 0 32 17
resolution 0 32 17
replaced 0 32 17
clear 0 32 17
prohibitions 0 32 17
imposed 0 32 17
on 0 32 17
Iran’s 0 32 17
ballistic 0 32 17
missile 0 32 17
program 0 32 17
with 0 32 17
a 0 32 17
weak 0 32 17
declaration 0 32 17
in 0 32 17
an 0 32 17
annex 0 32 17
that 0 32 17
simply 0 32 17
“calls 0 32 17
upon” 0 32 17
Iran 0 32 17
not 0 32 17
to 0 32 17

any 0 32 17
activity 0 32 17
such 0 32 17

of 0 32 17
delivering 0 32 17
nuclear 0 32 17
weapons 0 32 17
for 0 32 17
eight 0 32 17
years. 0 32 17

Iran 0 32 18
has 0 32 18
tested 0 32 18
several 0 32 18
ballistic 0 32 18
missiles 0 32 18
during 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
last 0 32 18
two 0 32 18
years, 0 32 18
including 0 32 18
two 0 32 18
Qadr 0 32 18
H 0 32 18
missiles 0 32 18
with 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
phrase 0 32 18
“Israel 1 32 18
must 1 32 18
be 1 32 18
wiped 1 32 18
out” 1 32 18
emblazoned 0 32 18
on 0 32 18
the 0 32 18
sides. 0 32 18

The 0 32 19
commander 0 32 19
of 0 32 19
Iran’s 0 32 19
Army, 0 32 19
Major 0 32 19
General 0 32 19
Ataollah 0 32 19
Salehi, 0 32 19
had 0 32 19
told 0 32 19
reporters 0 32 19
just 0 32 19
a 0 32 19
month 0 32 19
before 0 32 19
the 0 32 19
launch 0 32 19
of 0 32 19
those 0 32 19
missiles 0 32 19
that 0 32 19
Iran 0 32 19
was 0 32 19
"neither 0 32 19
paying 0 32 19

nor 0 32 19
implementing 0 32 19
them. 0 32 19

This 0 32 20
is 0 32 20
not 0 32 20
a 0 32 20
breach 0 32 20
of 0 32 20

the 0 32 21

that 0 32 21
the 0 32 21
Iranian 0 32 21

test 0 32 21
did 0 32 21
not 0 32 21
violate 0 32 21
the 0 32 21
resolution. 0 32 21

“A 0 32 22

legally 0 32 22
you 0 32 22

In 0 32 23
short, 0 32 23
the 0 32 23
JCPOA 0 32 23
did 0 32 23
not 0 32 23
cover 0 32 23
the 0 32 23

National 0 32 24
Security 0 32 24
Advisor 0 32 24
Ben 0 32 24
Rhodes 0 32 24
told 0 32 24
CNN, 0 32 24
during 0 32 24
an 0 32 24
interview 0 32 24
aired 0 32 24
on 0 32 24
April 0 32 24
6, 0 32 24
2015, 0 32 24
that 0 32 24
under 0 32 24
the 0 32 24
deal’s 0 32 24
terms 0 32 24
then 0 32 24
still 0 32 24
being 0 32 24
negotiated, 0 32 24
“you 0 32 24
will 0 32 24
have 0 32 24
anywhere, 0 32 24
anytime, 0 32 24
24/7 0 32 24
access 0 32 24
as 0 32 24
it 0 32 24
relates 0 32 24
to 0 32 24
the 0 32 24
nuclear 0 32 24
facilities 0 32 24
that 0 32 24
Iran 0 32 24
has." 0 32 24

Rhodes 0 32 25
claimed 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
“if 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
see 0 32 25
a 0 32 25
site 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
need 0 32 25
to 0 32 25
inspect 0 32 25
on 0 32 25
a 0 32 25
military 0 32 25
facility, 0 32 25
we 0 32 25
can 0 32 25
get 0 32 25
access 0 32 25
to 0 32 25
that 0 32 25
site 0 32 25

inspect 0 32 25
it. 0 32 25

So 0 32 26
if 0 32 26
it's 0 32 26
a 0 32 26
suspicious 0 32 26
site 0 32 26
that 0 32 26
we 0 32 26

we 0 32 26

This 1 32 26
was 1 32 26
another 1 32 26

in 0 32 27
July 0 32 27

considered 0 32 27
as 0 32 27
part 0 32 27
of 0 32 27
the 0 32 27
negotiations. 0 32 27

“We 0 32 28
never 0 32 28
sought 0 32 28
in 0 32 28
this 0 32 28
negotiation 0 32 28
the 0 32 28
capacity 0 32 28
for 0 32 28
so-called 0 32 28
anytime, 0 32 28
anywhere,” 0 32 28
Rhodes 0 32 28
said 0 32 28
on 0 32 28
July 0 32 28
14, 0 32 28
2015. 0 32 28

The 0 32 29
JCPOA’s 0 32 29
supporters, 0 32 29
including 0 32 29
Kerry, 0 32 29
have 0 32 29
made 0 32 29
much 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
fact 0 32 29
that 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
International 0 32 29
Atomic 0 32 29
Energy 0 32 29
Agency 0 32 29
(IAEA) 0 32 29
has 0 32 29
on 0 32 29
several 0 32 29
occasions 0 32 29
verified 0 32 29
Iran’s 0 32 29
compliance 0 32 29
with 0 32 29
its 0 32 29
commitments 0 32 29
under 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
JCPOA, 0 32 29
keeping 0 32 29
its 0 32 29
stock 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
low-enriched 0 32 29
uranium 0 32 29
below 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
limit 0 32 29
set 0 32 29
forth 0 32 29
in 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
JCPOA 0 32 29
and 0 32 29
not 0 32 29
pursuing 0 32 29
further 0 32 29
construction 0 32 29
of 0 32 29
the 0 32 29
Arak 0 32 29
reactor. 0 32 29

Iran 0 32 30
was 0 32 30
found 0 32 30
to 0 32 30
have 0 32 30
slightly 0 32 30
exceeded 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
limit 0 32 30
on 0 32 30
its 0 32 30
stock 0 32 30
of 0 32 30
heavy 0 32 30
water, 0 32 30
but 0 32 30
has 0 32 30
remedied 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
problem 0 32 30
to 0 32 30
the 0 32 30
IAEA’s 0 32 30
satisfaction. 0 32 30

IAEA 0 32 31
chief 0 32 31
Yukiya 0 32 31
Amano 0 32 31
reiterated 0 32 31
in 0 32 31
a 0 32 31
statement 0 32 31
he 0 32 31
issued 0 32 31
on 0 32 31
October 0 32 31
9th 0 32 31
that 0 32 31
Iran 0 32 31
has 0 32 31
remained 0 32 31
in 0 32 31
compliance 0 32 31
with 0 32 31
its 0 32 31
JCPOA 0 32 31
commitments. 0 32 31

The 0 32 32
problem, 0 32 32
as 0 32 32
any 0 32 32
clear-eyed 0 32 32
observer 0 32 32
of 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
process 0 32 32
recognizes, 0 32 32
is 0 32 32
that 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
IAEA 0 32 32
relies 0 32 32
on 0 32 32
Iran 0 32 32
for 0 32 32
self-inspection 0 32 32
of 0 32 32
certain 0 32 32
sites 0 32 32
that 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
regime 0 32 32
does 0 32 32
not 0 32 32
want 0 32 32
the 0 32 32
IAEA 0 32 32
to 0 32 32
inspect 0 32 32
freely 0 32 32
on 0 32 32
its 0 32 32
own. 0 32 32

IAEA 0 32 33
inspectors 0 32 33
have 0 32 33
avoided 0 32 33
examining 0 32 33
military 0 32 33
sites 0 32 33
it 0 32 33
knows 0 32 33
exists 0 32 33
and 0 32 33
has 0 32 33
no 0 32 33
reliable 0 32 33
way 0 32 33
of 0 32 33
tracking 0 32 33
undeclared 0 32 33
sites. 0 32 33

The 0 32 34
IAEA’s 0 32 34
explanation 0 32 34
for 0 32 34
not 0 32 34
visiting 0 32 34
any 0 32 34
of 0 32 34
Iran’s 0 32 34
known 0 32 34
military 0 32 34
sites 0 32 34
is 0 32 34
that 0 32 34
it 0 32 34
had 0 32 34
“no 0 32 34
reason 0 32 34
to 0 32 34
ask” 0 32 34
for 0 32 34
access. 0 32 34

Evidently, 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
IAEA 0 32 35
is 0 32 35
supposed 0 32 35
to 0 32 35
block 0 32 35
out 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
fact 0 32 35
that 0 32 35
Iran 0 32 35
had 0 32 35
conducted 0 32 35
tests 0 32 35
relevant 0 32 35
to 0 32 35
nuclear 0 32 35
bomb 0 32 35
detonations 0 32 35
at 0 32 35
a 0 32 35
military 0 32 35
site 0 32 35
before 0 32 35
the 0 32 35
JCPOA’s 0 32 35
finalization 0 32 35
in 0 32 35
2015. 0 32 35

The 0 32 36
IAEA 0 32 36
should 0 32 36
just 0 32 36
pretend 0 32 36
that 0 32 36
such 0 32 36
tests 0 32 36
could 0 32 36
not 0 32 36
possibly 0 32 36
happen 0 32 36
again. 0 32 36

“Nobody 0 32 37
is 0 32 37
allowed 0 32 37
to 0 32 37
visit 0 32 37
Iran's 0 32 37
military 0 32 37
sites,” 0 32 37
said 0 32 37
Iran’s 0 32 37
Head 0 32 37
of 0 32 37
Strategic 0 32 37
Research 0 32 37
Center 0 32 37
at 0 32 37
the 0 32 37
Expediency 0 32 37
Council 0 32 37
and 0 32 37
adviser 0 32 37
to 0 32 37
Supreme 0 32 37
Leader 0 32 37
Ayatollah 0 32 37
Khamenei, 0 32 37
Ali 0 32 37
Akbar 0 32 37
Velayati. 0 32 37

Intimidation 0 32 38
works. 0 32 38

The 0 32 39
IAEA 0 32 39
knows 0 32 39
not 0 32 39
to 0 32 39
ask. 0 32 39

As 0 32 40
to 0 32 40
the 0 32 40
JCPOA’s 0 32 40
sunset 0 32 40
provisions, 0 32 40
the 0 32 40
Obama 1 32 40
administration 1 32 40
lied 1 32 40
about 1 32 40
that 1 32 40
too. 1 32 40

Kerry 0 32 41
claimed 0 32 41
on 0 32 41
September 0 32 41
2, 0 32 41
2015 0 32 41
that 0 32 41
the 0 32 41
JCPOA 0 32 41
“never 0 32 41
sunsets. 0 32 41

There’s 0 32 42
no 0 32 42
sunset 0 32 42
in 0 32 42
this 0 32 42
agreement.” 0 32 42

This 0 32 43
month 0 32 43
Kerry 0 32 43
has 0 32 43
resorted 0 32 43
to 0 32 43
parsing 0 32 43
words. 0 32 43

He 0 32 44
claims 0 32 44
the 0 32 44
phrase 0 32 44
'sunset 0 32 44
provisions' 0 32 44
is 0 32 44
a 0 32 44
“misnomer,” 0 32 44
before 0 32 44
then 0 32 44
defending 0 32 44
the 0 32 44
JCPOA’s 0 32 44
time 0 32 44
limits. 0 32 44

"We 0 32 45
were 0 32 45
comfortable 0 32 45
because 0 32 45
the 0 32 45
cap 0 32 45
on 0 32 45
Iran’s 0 32 45
low-enriched 0 32 45
uranium 0 32 45
stockpile 0 32 45
remains 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
place 0 32 45
until 0 32 45
2030,” 0 32 45
Kerry 0 32 45
wrote 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
an 0 32 45
article 0 32 45
published 0 32 45
in 0 32 45
the 0 32 45
Washington 0 32 45
Post 0 32 45
late 0 32 45
last 0 32 45
month. 0 32 45

In 0 32 46
other 0 32 46
words, 0 32 46
let’s 1 32 46
just 1 32 46
kick 1 32 46
the 1 32 46
can 1 32 46
down 1 32 46
the 1 32 46
road 1 32 46
and 0 32 46
hope 0 32 46
for 0 32 46
a 0 32 46
more 0 32 46
reasonable 0 32 46
Iranian 0 32 46
regime 0 32 46
in 0 32 46
13 0 32 46
years 0 32 46
that 0 32 46
would 0 32 46
agree 0 32 46
to 0 32 46
extend 0 32 46
the 0 32 46
time 0 32 46
limits. 0 32 46

In 0 32 47
the 0 32 47
meantime, 0 32 47
Kerry 0 32 47
advises 0 32 47
us 0 32 47
not 0 32 47
to 0 32 47
worry. 0 32 47

Kerry 0 32 48
declared, 0 32 48
“15 0 32 48
or 0 32 48
25 0 32 48
years 0 32 48
from 0 32 48
now, 0 32 48
we 0 32 48
still 0 32 48
have 0 32 48
the 0 32 48
same 0 32 48
military 0 32 48
options 0 32 48
we 0 32 48
have 0 32 48
today.” 0 32 48

John 0 32 49
Kerry 0 32 49
has 0 32 49
obviously 0 32 49
learned 0 32 49
nothing 0 32 49
from 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korean 0 32 49
fiasco, 1 32 49
which 0 32 49
resulted 0 32 49
from 0 32 49
years 0 32 49
of 0 32 49
phony 1 32 49
agreements 1 32 49
with 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
rogue 0 32 49
regime 0 32 49
and 0 32 49
so-called 0 32 49
“strategic 0 32 49
patience.” 0 32 49
The 0 32 49
United 0 32 49
States 0 32 49
clearly 0 32 49
does 0 32 49
not 0 32 49
have 0 32 49
the 0 32 49
same 0 32 49
military 0 32 49
options 0 32 49
today 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
deal 0 32 49
with 0 32 49
a 0 32 49
nuclear 0 32 49
armed 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korea 0 32 49
as 0 32 49
it 0 32 49
did 0 32 49
23 0 32 49
years 0 32 49
ago 0 32 49
when 0 32 49
former 0 32 49
President 0 32 49
Bill 0 32 49
Clinton 0 32 49
decided 0 32 49
not 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
use 0 32 49
military 0 32 49
force 0 32 49
to 0 32 49
stamp 0 32 49
out 0 32 49
North 0 32 49
Korea’s 0 32 49
nuclear 0 32 49
program 0 32 49
at 0 32 49
its 0 32 49
inception. 0 32 49

Instead, 0 32 50
Clinton 0 32 50
started 0 32 50
us 0 32 50
down 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
primrose 0 32 50
path 0 32 50
of 0 32 50
naïve 0 32 50
diplomacy 0 32 50
with 0 32 50
a 0 32 50
duplicitous 0 32 50
regime 0 32 50
that 0 32 50
now 0 32 50
is 0 32 50
on 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
verge 0 32 50
of 0 32 50
being 0 32 50
able 0 32 50
to 0 32 50
strike 0 32 50
the 0 32 50
U.S. 0 32 50
mainland 0 32 50
with 0 32 50
nuclear 0 32 50
warheads 0 32 50
delivered 0 32 50
by 0 32 50
intercontinental 0 32 50
ballistic 0 32 50
missiles. 0 32 50

It 0 32 51
is 0 32 51
precisely 0 32 51
because 0 32 51
North 1 32 51
Korea’s 1 32 51
actions 1 32 51
over 1 32 51
the 1 32 51
last 1 32 51
23 1 32 51
years 1 32 51
have 1 32 51
proven 1 32 51
that 1 32 51
making 1 32 51
concessions 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
a 1 32 51
rogue 1 32 51
regime 1 32 51
in 1 32 51
order 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
obtain 1 32 51
denuclearization 1 32 51
commitments 1 32 51
is 1 32 51
so 1 32 51
dangerous 1 32 51
that 1 32 51
President 1 32 51
Trump 1 32 51
does 1 32 51
not 1 32 51
want 1 32 51
to 1 32 51
make 1 32 51
the 1 32 51
same 1 32 51
mistake 1 32 51
with 1 32 51
Iran. 1 32 51

America’s 0 32 52
European 0 32 52
allies 0 32 52
are 0 32 52
also 0 32 52
upset 0 32 52
with 0 32 52
President 0 32 52
Trump 0 32 52
for 0 32 52
refusing 0 32 52
to 0 32 52
recertify 0 32 52
the 0 32 52
deal 0 32 52
and 0 32 52
threatening 0 32 52
to 0 32 52
pull 0 32 52
out 0 32 52
if 0 32 52
certain 0 32 52
conditions 0 32 52
are 0 32 52
not 0 32 52
met. 0 32 52

British 0 32 53
Prime 0 32 53
Minister 0 32 53
Theresa 0 32 53
May, 0 32 53
French 0 32 53
President 0 32 53
Emmanuel 0 32 53
Macron 0 32 53
and 0 32 53
German 0 32 53
Chancellor 0 32 53
Angela 0 32 53
Merkel 0 32 53
issued 0 32 53
a 0 32 53
joint 0 32 53
statement 0 32 53
last 0 32 53
Friday 0 32 53
praising 0 32 53
the 0 32 53
JCPOA 0 32 53
and 0 32 53
its 0 32 53
implementation. 0 32 53

They 0 32 54
said 0 32 54
that 0 32 54
the 0 32 54
nuclear 0 32 54
deal 0 32 54
with 0 32 54
Iran 0 32 54
was 0 32 54
“the 0 32 54
culmination 0 32 54
of 0 32 54
13 0 32 54
years 0 32 54
of 0 32 54
diplomacy 0 32 54
and 0 32 54
was 0 32 54
a 0 32 54
major 0 32 54
step 0 32 54
towards 0 32 54
ensuring 0 32 54
that 0 32 54
Iran’s 0 32 54
nuclear 0 32 54
programme 0 32 54
is 0 32 54
not 0 32 54
diverted 0 32 54
for 0 32 54
military 0 32 54
purposes. 0 32 54

Therefore, 0 32 55
we 0 32 55
encourage 0 32 55
the 1 32 55
US 1 32 55
Administration 1 32 55
and 1 32 55
Congress 1 32 55
to 1 32 55
consider 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
implications 1 32 55
to 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
security 1 32 55
of 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
US 1 32 55
and 1 32 55
its 1 32 55
allies 1 32 55
before 1 32 55
taking 1 32 55
any 1 32 55
steps 1 32 55
that 1 32 55
might 1 32 55
undermine 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
JCPOA, 1 32 55
such 1 32 55
as 1 32 55
re-imposing 1 32 55
sanctions 1 32 55
on 1 32 55
Iran 1 32 55
lifted 1 32 55
under 1 32 55
the 1 32 55
agreement.” 1 32 55

Perhaps 0 32 56
these 0 32 56
European 0 32 56
leaders 0 32 56
should 0 32 56
remember 0 32 56
their 0 32 56
own 0 32 56
history. 0 32 56
