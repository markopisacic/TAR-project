Arabic, 0 42 34
“You’re 0 42 34
a 0 42 34

one 0 42 34
of 0 42 34
many 0 42 34
times 0 42 34
Zakkout 0 42 34
has 0 42 34
referred 0 42 34
to 0 42 34
Jews 0 42 34
as 0 42 34
“monkeys 1 42 34
and 1 42 34
pigs.” 1 42 34

In 0 42 35
July 0 42 35
2014, 0 42 35
Zakkout 0 42 35
organized 0 42 35
a 0 42 35

On 0 42 36

goers 0 42 36
repeatedly 0 42 36
shout, 0 42 36
“We 0 42 36

Hamas.” 0 42 36
After 0 42 36
the 0 42 36
rally, 0 42 36
Zakkout 0 42 36
wrote 0 42 36

has 0 42 38
been 0 42 38
evident 0 42 38
for 0 42 38
years. 0 42 38

Yet, 0 42 39
there 0 42 39
is 0 42 39
no 0 42 39

It 0 42 40

In 0 42 43

It 0 42 44
is 0 42 44
time 0 42 44
