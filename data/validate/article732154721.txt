Orbán 0 423 12
and 0 423 12
Soros 0 423 12
have 0 423 12
a 0 423 12
history, 0 423 12

and 0 423 12
ending 0 423 12
in 0 423 12
acrimony. 0 423 12

Orbán 0 423 13

as 0 423 13
a 0 423 13

Soros, 0 423 14
who 0 423 14
expatriated 0 423 14

But 0 423 15
Orbán’s 0 423 15
defense 0 423 15
of 0 423 15
conservative 0 423 15
values 0 423 15
has 0 423 15
led 0 423 15

breaking 0 423 15

Soros, 0 423 15
whom 0 423 15
he 0 423 15

continued: 0 423 17

Soros, 0 423 18
for 0 423 18
his 0 423 18
part, 0 423 18
compared 1 423 18
Orbán 1 423 18
unfavourably 1 423 18
to 1 423 18
both 1 423 18
the 1 423 18
Nazis 1 423 18
and 1 423 18
the 1 423 18
Communists, 1 423 18
saying 0 423 18
his 0 423 18
rule 0 423 18
evoked 0 423 18
dark 0 423 18
tones 0 423 18
from 0 423 18
the 0 423 18
1930's, 0 423 18
when 0 423 18
Hungary 0 423 18
was 0 423 18
allied 0 423 18
with 0 423 18
Nazi 0 423 18
Germany. 0 423 18

But 0 423 19
Orbán 0 423 19
remains 0 423 19
committed 0 423 19
to 0 423 19
his 0 423 19
policy, 0 423 19
claiming 0 423 19
that 0 423 19
Soros 0 423 19
and 0 423 19
supporters 0 423 19
of 0 423 19
migration 0 423 19
are 0 423 19
losing 0 423 19
the 0 423 19
fight. 0 423 19

He 0 423 20
said: 0 423 20
“Soros 0 423 20
has 0 423 20
antagonised 0 423 20
not 0 423 20
only 0 423 20
us 0 423 20
but 0 423 20
also 0 423 20
England, 0 423 20
President 0 423 20
Trump 0 423 20
and 0 423 20
Israel 0 423 20
too. 0 423 20

Everywhere 0 423 21
he 0 423 21
wants 0 423 21
to 0 423 21
get 0 423 21
migration 0 423 21
accepted. 0 423 21

It 0 423 22
won't 0 423 22
work. 0 423 22

We 0 423 23
are 0 423 23
not 0 423 23
alone 0 423 23
and 0 423 23
we 0 423 23
will 0 423 23

together 0 423 23

we 0 423 23

In 0 423 24
addition 0 423 24

as 0 423 24
the 0 423 24

for 0 423 24
purportedly 0 423 24
discriminating 0 423 24
against 0 423 24
homosexuals 0 423 24
because 0 423 24
of 0 423 24
Hungary’s 0 423 24
insistence 0 423 24
on 0 423 24
defining 0 423 24
marriage 0 423 24

Last 0 423 25

Orbán 0 423 25
also 0 423 25
criticized 0 423 25

encouraged 0 423 25
