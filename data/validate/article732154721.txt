European 1 69 3
nations 1 69 3
which 1 69 3
have 1 69 3

“opened 1 69 3

and 1 69 3
the 1 69 3

of 1 69 3

Orbán 0 69 4
painted 0 69 4
an 0 69 4
image 0 69 4
of 0 69 4
Western 0 69 4
Europe 0 69 4
being 0 69 4
overwhelmed 0 69 4
by 0 69 4
the 0 69 4

influx 0 69 4
Muslim 0 69 4
immigrants 0 69 4
in 0 69 4
recent 0 69 4
years. 0 69 4

“According 0 69 5
to 0 69 5
estimates, 0 69 5
the 0 69 5
proportion 0 69 5
of 0 69 5

will 0 69 5
grow 0 69 5
at 0 69 5

said 0 69 5
Orbán. 0 69 5

“I 0 69 6
won't 0 69 6
even 0 69 6
say 0 69 6
anything 0 69 6
about 0 69 6
France 0 69 6

Holland, 0 69 6
but 0 69 6
even 0 69 6
the 0 69 6

first.” 0 69 6

Orbán 0 69 7
warned 0 69 7
that 0 69 7
as 0 69 7
Western 1 69 7
Europe 1 69 7
becomes 1 69 7
saturated 1 69 7
with 1 69 7
Muslim 1 69 7
occupants, 1 69 7
Islamists 1 69 7

in 1 69 7
to 1 69 7
his 1 69 7
country 1 69 7
from 1 69 7
both 1 69 7
Western 1 69 7

as 1 69 7
well 1 69 7
as 1 69 7
from 1 69 7
Islamic 1 69 7
nations. 1 69 7

“This 0 69 8
means 0 69 8
that 0 69 8
the 1 69 8

the 1 69 8
true 1 69 8
faith, 1 69 8
in 0 69 8
the 0 69 8

from 0 69 8

1989, 0 69 11
which 0 69 11
has 0 69 11

Orbán 0 69 12
and 0 69 12
Soros 0 69 12
have 0 69 12
a 0 69 12
history, 0 69 12
beginning 0 69 12
in 0 69 12
partnership 0 69 12
and 0 69 12
ending 0 69 12
in 0 69 12
acrimony. 0 69 12

Orbán 0 69 13
started 0 69 13
public 0 69 13
life 0 69 13
as 0 69 13
a 0 69 13
crusader 0 69 13
against 0 69 13

and 0 69 13
attended 0 69 13

on 0 69 13
a 0 69 13
Soros 0 69 13

Soros, 0 69 14
who 0 69 14
expatriated 0 69 14
from 0 69 14
Hungary, 0 69 14
also 0 69 14

the 0 69 14
Alliance 0 69 14
for 0 69 14

But 0 69 15
Orbán’s 0 69 15
defense 0 69 15
of 0 69 15
conservative 0 69 15
values 0 69 15
has 0 69 15
led 0 69 15
to 0 69 15
breaking 0 69 15
ties 0 69 15
with 0 69 15
Soros, 0 69 15
whom 0 69 15
he 0 69 15
now 0 69 15
criticizes 0 69 15

After 0 69 16
Prime 0 69 16

Orbán 0 69 16
delivered 0 69 16
his 0 69 16

worded 0 69 16
state 0 69 16
of 0 69 16

a 0 69 16
UK 0 69 16

Mail 0 69 16
report 0 69 16
said, 0 69 16
“Orbán 0 69 16
has 0 69 16
conflated 0 69 16
the 0 69 16
issue 0 69 16
of 0 69 16
immigration 0 69 16
with 0 69 16
the 0 69 16

whose 1 69 16

The 0 69 17

continued: 0 69 17

Soros, 0 69 18
for 0 69 18
his 0 69 18
part, 0 69 18
compared 1 69 18
Orbán 1 69 18
unfavourably 1 69 18
to 1 69 18
both 1 69 18
the 1 69 18
Nazis 1 69 18
and 1 69 18
the 1 69 18
Communists, 1 69 18
saying 0 69 18
his 0 69 18
rule 0 69 18
evoked 0 69 18
dark 0 69 18
tones 0 69 18
from 0 69 18
the 0 69 18
1930's, 0 69 18
when 0 69 18
Hungary 0 69 18
was 0 69 18
allied 0 69 18
with 0 69 18
Nazi 0 69 18
Germany. 0 69 18

But 0 69 19
Orbán 0 69 19
remains 0 69 19
committed 0 69 19
to 0 69 19
his 0 69 19
policy, 0 69 19
claiming 0 69 19
that 0 69 19
Soros 0 69 19
and 0 69 19
supporters 0 69 19
of 0 69 19
migration 0 69 19
are 0 69 19
losing 0 69 19
the 0 69 19
fight. 0 69 19

He 0 69 20
said: 0 69 20
“Soros 0 69 20
has 0 69 20
antagonised 0 69 20
not 0 69 20
only 0 69 20
us 0 69 20
but 0 69 20
also 0 69 20
England, 0 69 20
President 0 69 20
Trump 0 69 20
and 0 69 20
Israel 0 69 20
too. 0 69 20

Everywhere 0 69 21
he 0 69 21
wants 0 69 21
to 0 69 21
get 0 69 21
migration 0 69 21
accepted. 0 69 21

It 0 69 22
won't 0 69 22
work. 0 69 22

We 0 69 23
are 0 69 23
not 0 69 23
alone 0 69 23
and 0 69 23
we 0 69 23
will 0 69 23
fight 0 69 23
together 0 69 23
and 0 69 23
we 0 69 23
will 0 69 23
succeed.” 0 69 23

In 0 69 24

to 0 69 24
inviting 0 69 24

as 0 69 24
the 0 69 24
European 0 69 24

for 0 69 24
purportedly 0 69 24
discriminating 0 69 24
against 0 69 24
homosexuals 0 69 24
because 0 69 24
of 0 69 24
Hungary’s 0 69 24
insistence 0 69 24
on 0 69 24
defining 0 69 24
