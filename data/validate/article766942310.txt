Who 0
‘Won’ 0
the 0
Trump-Kim 0
Summit? 0

Last 0
week’s 0
Economist 0
Magazine 0
won 0
the 0
day 0
with 0
the 0
best-ever 1
headline 0
about 0
the 0
Trump-Kim 0
Jong-un 0
summit: 0
`Kim 0
Jong 0
Won!’ 0

That 0
said 0
it 0
all. 0

Just 0
out 0
of 0
hospital, 0
I 0
was 0
in 0
no 0
shape 0
to 0
compete 0
with 0
the 0
great 0
Economist 0
or 0
its 0
very 0
witty 0
headline 0
writers. 0

But 0
after 0
watching 0
a 0
week 0
of 0
post 0
Singapore 0
summit 0
between 0
Great 1
White 1
Father 1
Trump 0
and 0
delinquent 1
Kim 0
Jong-un 0
I 0
must 0
totally 0
agree 0
with 0
the 0
Economist. 0

What 0
was 0
billed 0
as 0
a 0
second-coming 0
extravaganza 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
leaders 0
– 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
trading 0
insults 0
of 0
‘little 1
rocket 1
man’ 1
and 0
‘dotard’ 1
(someone 0
who 0
is 0
senile) 0
turned 0
out 0
to 0
be 0
a 0
very 1
expensive 1
photo 0
op 0
for 0
both 0
publicity 0
seekers 0
that 0
made 0
much 0
noise 0
but 0
produced 0
very 0
little 0
– 0
at 0
least 0
so 0
far. 0

It 0
seemed 0
as 0
if 0
two 0
schoolyard 1
bullies 1
had 0
been 0
forced 0
by 0
the 0
principal 0
to 0
shake 0
hands. 0

Beyond 0
gestures, 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
leader 0
certainly 0
came 0
out 0
ahead. 0

His 0
objective 0
– 0
and 0
those 0
of 0
his 0
family 0
predecessors 0
for 0
the 0
past 0
60 0
years 0
– 0
was 0
to 0
normalize 0
relations 0
with 0
the 0
US, 0
start 0
trade, 0
and 0
end 0
US 0
efforts 0
to 0
overthrow 0
the 0
Marxist 0

Pyongyang. 0

Trump’s 0
objectives, 0
at 0
least 0
initially, 0
were 0
to 1
crush 1
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
the 0
threats 0
it 0
could 0
pose 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
its 0
regional 0
allies 0
Japan 0
and 0
South 0
Korea. 0

Trump 0
sought 0
to 0
set 0
up 0
Kim 0
as 0
a 0
bogeyman, 1
and 0
himself 0
as 0
America’s 1
savior. 1

Trump 0
knew 0
perfectly 1
well 1
that 0
he 0
could 0
not 0
destroy 0
all 0
of 0
North 0
Korea’s 0
deeply 0
buried 0
nuclear-armed 0
missiles, 0
and, 0
in 0
spite 0
of 0
his 0
huffing 0
and 0
puffing, 0
had 1
no 1
stomach 1
for 1
an 1
invasion 1
of 0
North 0
Korea 0
that 0
could 0
cost 0
the 0
US 0
an 0
estimated 0
250,000 0
casualties. 0

So 0
Trump’s 0
solution 0
was 0
more 0
show-biz. 1

A 0
much 1
ballyhooed 1
flight 0
to 0
Singapore, 0
backslapping 0
a 0
delighted 1
Kim, 0
and 0
a 0
love-fest 1
between 0
the 0
two 0
chunky 1
leaders 0
was 1
sold 1
to 1
Americans 0
as 0
the 0
dawn 0
of 0
peace. 0

America’s 0
media 0
was 0
quick 0
to 0
retail 0
the 0
story 0
and 0
burnish 1
Trump’s 0
credentials 0
among 0
the 0
seriously 0
credulous. 0

No 0
more 0
hiding 0
under 0
your 0
school 0
desks 0
or 0
in 0
dank 0
basements. 0

As 0
Trump 0
grandly 1
proclaimed, 0
Americans 1
no 1
longer 1
have 1
to 1
fear 1
North 1
Korea 1
and 0
can 1
sleep 1
peacefully 1
at 1
night! 1

Why? 1

Korea 0
still 0
has 0
all 0
of 0
its 0
medium 0
and 0
long-ranged 0
missiles 0
and 0
an 0
estimated 0
40 0
or 0
more 0
nuclear 0
warheads. 0

The 0
North 0
is 0
developing 0
submarines 0
that 0
can 0
launch 0
nuclear-armed 0
missiles 0
from 0
underwater 0
off 0
America’s 0
coasts. 0

For 0
Kim, 0
these 0
weapons 0
are 0
purely 0
defensive, 0
designed 0
to 0
prevent 0
a 0
US 0
attack 0
on 0
his 0
nation. 0

But 0
he 0
is 0
now 0
a 0
full-fledged 0
member 0
of 0
the 0
nuclear 0
club. 0

Equally 0
important, 0
North 0
Korea 0
still 0
has 0
an 0
estimated 0
14,000 0
170mm 0
guns 0
and 0
hundreds 0
of 0
300mm 0
long-ranged 0
rocket 0
launchers 0
emplaced 0
in 0
caves 0
just 0
north 0
of 0
the 0
Demilitarized 0
Zone 0
between 0
the 0
two 0
Koreas. 0

They 0
threaten 0
almost 0
all 0
of 0
South 0
Korea’s 0
capital 0
Seoul 0
north 0
of 0
the 0
Han 0
River 0
and 0
some 0
US 0
military 0
bases 0
and 0
key 0
airfields, 0
notably 0
Osan. 0

This 0
is 0
a 1
very 1
real 1
threat 1
– 0
one 0
that 0
is 0
largely 0
immune 0
to 0
attack 0
from 0
the 0
air. 0

I 0
have 0
seen 0
these 0
emplacements 0
from 0
the 0
northern 0
edge 0
of 0
the 0
DMZ. 0

Kim’s 0
big 0
guns 0
hold 0
Seoul’s 0
millions 0
of 0
inhabitants 0
hostage. 0

There 0
is 0
no 0
mention 0
of 0
this 0
artillery 0
threat 0
in 0
the 0
final 0
communiqué 0
issued 0
by 0
Trump 0

But 0
it 0

stop 0
the 0
highly 1
provocative 1
US/South 0
Korean 0
war 0
games 0
simulating 0
an 0
invasion 0
of 0
the 0
North, 0
a 0
key 0
demand 0
by 0
Kim. 0

This 0
column 0
has 0
been 0
calling 0
for 0
their 0
end 0
for 0
a 0
decade. 0

North 0
Korea 0
will 0
seemingly 0
halt 0
its 0
missile 0
tests. 0

This 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
‘denuclearization’ 0
of 0
North 0
Korea 0
that 0
has 0
been 0
bandied 0
about. 0

There 0
may 0
be 0
a 0
few 0
gestures 0
of 0
disarmament 0
but 0
Kim 0
must 0
know 0
that 0
his 0
nukes 0
are 0
his 0
means 0
of 0
survival. 0

In 0
case 0
Kim 0
didn’t 0
remember 0
the 0
dire 0
fate 0
of 0
Iraq, 0
Libya, 0
and 0
Syria, 0
Trump’s 0
new 0
national 0
security 0
advisor 0
John 0
Bolton, 0
a 0
fanatic’s 1
fanatic, 1
cheerfully 1
recalled 0
the 0
doom 1
of 0
Libya’s 0
murdered 0
Col. 0
Khadaffi. 0

The 0
Singapore 0
summit 0
was 0
also 0
a 0
huge 1
humiliation 1
for 0
America’s 0
allies 0
Japan 0
and 0
South 0
Korea. 0

In 0
Asia, 0
preserving 0
‘face’ 0
is 0
essential. 0

Trump 0
completely 0
ignored 0
America’s 0
two 0
old 0
allies 0
after 0
his 0
meeting 0
with 0
Kim 0
– 0
who 0
routinely 0
blasts 0
Japan 0
and 0
South 0
Korea 0
as 0
‘America’s 1
stooges.’ 1
Instead, 0
Trump 0
sent 0
his 0
beginner 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Mike 0
Pompeo 0
to 0
explain 0
what 0
happened 0
in 0
Singapore, 0
inflicting 0
a 0
deep 0
loss 0
of 0
face 0
on 0
Tokyo 0
and 0
Seoul. 0

This 0
was 0
a 0
terrible 1
insult 1
and 0
could 0
spark 0
decisions 0
by 0
at 0
least 0
Japan 0
to 0
proceed 0
ahead 0
with 0
its 0
covert 0
nuclear 0
program. 0

Japan 0
can 0
deploy 0
nuclear 0
weapons 0
in 0
3-6 0
months; 0
South 0
Korea 0
is 0
not 0
far 0
behind. 0

The 0
United 0
States 0
and 0
North 0
Korea 0
are 0
now 0
on 0
a 0
more 0
civilized 0
level 0
of 0
behavior. 0

But 0
nothing 0
basic 0
has 0
been 0
resolved. 0

Maybe 0
Trump 0
has 0
some 0
more 0
concessions 0
up 0
his 0
sleeve, 0
like 0
cutting 0
the 0
number 0
of 0
US 0
troops 0
in 0
the 0
South. 0

But 0
Korea 0
is 0
now 0
on 0
the 0
