Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
has 0
released 0
a 0
new, 0
powerful 0
statement 0
necessitated 0
by 0
the 0
peculiar 0
reaction 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
to 0
the 0
Aug 0
22 0
Testimony. 0

Many 0
thanks 0
to 0
our 0
friends 0
at 0
LifeSiteNews, 0
especially 0
Diane 0
Montagna, 0
for 0
the 0
following 0
translation 0
and 0
release 0
of 0
the 0
follow-up 0
testimony 0
from 0
arguably 0
the 1
most 1
courageous 1
prelate 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
today—Archbishop 1
Carlo 1
Maria 1
Viganò. 1

The 0
former 0
Apostolic 0
Nuncio 0
to 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
has, 0
as 0
they 0
say, 0
doubled 0
down. 0

Far 0
from 0
backing-away 0
and 0
making 0
excuses 0
for 0
his 0
early 0
actions, 0
as 0
we’ve 0
all 0
become 0
so 0
accustomed 0
to 0
seeing 0
in 0
these 0
rare 0
cases 0
where 0
a 0
hierarch 0
breaks 0
ranks, 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò 0
is 0
digging 0
in 0
with 0
a 1
4-page 1
bombshell 1
that 0
restates 0
his 0
initial 0
accusations 0
of 0
abuse 0
cover-up 0
against 0
Francis 0
and 0
other 0
powerful 0
members 0
of 0
the 0
hierarchy, 0
and 0
even 0
concludes 0
with 0
a 0
suggestion 0
that 0
Francis 0
is 0
beginning 0
to 0
act 0
as 0
a 1
“substitute 1
of 1
our 1
Lord.” 1

Read 0
the 0
Archbishop’s 0
words 0
for 0
yourselves 0
and 0
note 0
well 0
the 0
ring 0
of 0
truth 0
that 0
resonates 0
in 0
every 0
sentence. 0

This 1
is 1
clearly 1
the 1
testimony 1
of 1
an 1
honest 1
man 1
who 1
has 1
only 1
the 1
good 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
in 1
his 1
heart—a 1
modern-day 1
Athanasius 1
standing 1
against 1
something 1
so 1
much 1
worse 1
than 1
Liberius. 1

Friends, 0
let 0
us 0
pray 0
for 0
Archbishop 0
Viganò. 0

He 0
is 0
standing 0
alone 0
now, 0
and 0
not 0
only 0
against 0
the 1
most 1
dangerous 1
pontificate 1
in 1
history, 1
but 0
also 0
the 1
forces 1
of 1
hell 1
itself—forces 0
which 0
will 0
do 0
all 0
in 0
their 0
power 0
to 0
silence 0
this 0
voice 1
crying 1
in 1
the 1
wilderness. 1

Make 0
no 0
mistake 0
about 0
this: 0
Archbishop 1
Viganò 1
is 1
fighting 1
for 1
the 1
very 1
survival 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
element 1
of 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church. 1

He 0
is 0
standing 0
against 0
corrupt 0
men 0
in 0
high 0
places 0
who 0
cannot 0
be 0
trusted 0
to 0
do 0
what 0
is 0
best 0
for 0
souls, 0
for 0
the 0
Catholic 0
faithful 0
or 0
indeed 0
for 0
Holy 0
Mother 0
Church 0
herself. 0

The 1
enemy 1
is 1
not 1
only 1
at 1
the 1
gates 1
but 1
has 1
now 1
made 1
their 1
way 1
to 1
the 1
thrones 1
of 1
power 1
and 1
the 1
seats 1
of 1
the 1
Apostles. 1

God 1
help 1
us. 1

It 0
goes 0
without 0
saying 0
that 0
we 0
here 0
at 0
The 0
Remnant 0
not 0
only 0
stand 0
with 0
Viganò 0
but 0
we 0
thank 0
God 0
for 0
him 0
every 0
day, 0
we 0
pray 0
the 0
Rosary 0
for 0
him 0
every 0
day, 0
and 0
wish 1
him 1
every 1
blessing 1
and 1
heavenly 1
consolation 1
as 1
he 1
undergoes 1
this 1
passion 1
for 1
the 1
sake 1
of 1
the 1
Master 1
he 1
serves 1
so 1
well. 1

God 0
bless 0
you, 0
Your 0
Excellency, 0
and 0
Mary 0
keep 0
you. 0

We 0
are 0
with 0
you! 0

all 0
like 0
to 0

Our 0

(Psalm 0

***** 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
a 0
month 0
since 0
I 0
offered 0
my 0
testimony, 0
solely 0
for 0
the 0
good 0
of 0
the 0
Church, 0
regarding 0
what 0
occurred 0
at 0
the 0
audience 0
with 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
on 0
June 0
23, 0
2013 0
and 0
regarding 0
certain 0
matters 0
I 0
was 0
given 0
to 0
know 0
in 0
the 0
assignments 0
entrusted 0
to 0
me 0
at 0
the 0
Secretariat 0
of 0
State 0
and 0
in 0
Washington, 0
in 0
relation 0
to 0
those 0
who 0
bear 0
responsibility 0
for 0
covering 0
up 0
the 0
crimes 0
committed 0
by 0
the 0
former 0
archbishop 0
of 0
that 0
capital. 0

My 0
decision 0
to 0
reveal 0
those 0
grave 0
facts 0
was 0
for 0
me 0
the 1
most 1
painful 1
and 1
serious 1
decision 1
that 1
I 1
have 1
ever 1
made 1
in 1
my 1
life. 1

I 0
made 0
it 0
after 0
long 0
reflection 0
and 0
prayer, 0
during 1
months 1
of 1
profound 1
suffering 1
and 1
anguish, 1
during 1
a 1
crescendo 1
of 1
continual 1
news 1
of 1
terrible 1
events, 1
with 1
thousands 1
of 1
innocent 1
victims 1
destroyed 1
and 1
the 1
vocations 1
and 1
lives 1
of 1
young 1
priests 1
and 1
religious 1
disturbed. 1

The 0
silence 0
of 0
the 0
pastors 0
who 0
could 0
have 0
provided 0
a 0
remedy 0
and 0
prevented 0
new 0
victims 0
became 0
increasingly 0
indefensible, 0
a 1
devastating 1
crime 1
for 1
the 1
Church. 1

Well 0
aware 0
of 0
the 0
enormous 0
consequences 0
that 0
my 0
testimony 0
could 0
have, 0
because 0
what 0
I 0
was 0
about 0
to 0
reveal 0
involved 0
the 0
successor 0
of 0
Peter 0
himself, 0
I 0
nonetheless 0
chose 0
to 0
speak 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
I 0
declare 0
with 0
a 0
clear 0
conscience 0
before 0
God 0
that 0
my 0
testimony 0
is 0
true. 0

Christ 0
died 0
for 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
Peter, 0
Servus 0
servorum 0
Dei, 0
is 0
the 0
first 0
one 0
called 0
to 0
serve 0
the 0
spouse 0
of 0
Christ. 0

Certainly, 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
facts 0
that 0
I 0
was 0
to 0
reveal 0
were 0
covered 0
by 0
the 0
pontifical 0
secret 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
promised 0
to 0
observe 0
and 0
that 0
I 0
had 0
faithfully 0
observed 0
from 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
my 0
service 0
to 0
the 0
Holy 0
See. 0

But 0
the 0
purpose 0
of 0
any 0
secret, 0
including 0
the 0
pontifical 0
secret, 0
is 0
to 0
protect 0
the 0
Church 0
from 0
her 0
enemies, 0
not 0
to 0
cover 0
up 0
and 0
become 0
complicit 0
in 0
crimes 0
committed 0
by 0
some 0
of 0
her 0
members. 0

I 0
was 0
a 0
witness, 0
not 0
by 0
my 0
choice, 0
of 0
shocking 1
facts 1
and, 0
as 0
the 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church 0
states 0
(par. 0

2491), 0
the 0
seal 0
of 0
secrecy 0
is 0
not 0
binding 0
when 0
very 0
grave 0
harm 0
can 0
be 0
avoided 0
only 0
by 0
divulging 0
the 0
truth. 0

Only 0
the 0
seal 0
of 0
confession 0
could 0
have 0
justified 0
my 0
silence. 0

Neither 0
the 0
pope, 0
nor 0
any 0
of 0
the 0
cardinals 0
in 0
Rome 0
have 0
denied 0
the 0
facts 0
I 0
asserted 0
in 0
my 0
testimony. 0

“Qui 0
tacet 0
consentit” 0
surely 0
applies 0
here, 0
for 0
if 0
they 0
deny 0
my 0
testimony, 0
they 0
have 0
only 0
to 0
say 0
so, 0
and 0
provide 0
documentation 0
to 0
support 0
that 0
denial. 0

How 1
can 1
one 1
avoid 1
concluding 1
that 1
the 1
reason 1
they 1
do 1
not 1
provide 1
the 1
documentation 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
know 1
it 1
confirms 1
my 1
testimony? 1

The 0
center 0
of 0
my 0
testimony 0
was 0
that 0
since 0
at 0
least 0
June 0
23, 0
2013, 0
the 0
pope 0
knew 0
from 0
me 0
how 1
perverse 1
and 1
evil 1
McCarrick 0
was 0
in 0
his 0
intentions 0
and 0
actions, 0
and 0
instead 1
of 1
taking 1
the 1
measures 1
that 1
every 1
good 1
pastor 1
would 1
have 1
taken, 1
the 1
pope 1
made 1
McCarrick 1
one 1
of 1
his 1
principal 1
agents 1
in 1
governing 1
the 1
Church, 1
in 1
regard 1
to 1
the 1
United 1
States, 1
the 1
Curia, 1
and 1
even 1
China, 1
as 1
we 1
are 1
seeing 1
these 1
days 1
with 1
great 1
concern 1
and 1
anxiety 1
for 1
that 1
martyr 1
Church. 1

Now, 1
the 1
pope’s 1
reply 1
to 1
my 1
testimony 1
was: 1
“I 1
will 1
not 1
say 1
a 1
word!” 1
But 1
then, 1
contradicting 1
himself, 1
he 1
has 1
compared 1
his 1
silence 1
to 1
that 1
of 1
Jesus 1
in 1
Nazareth 1
and 1
before 1
Pilate, 1
and 0
compared 0
me 0
to 0
the 1
great 1
accuser, 1
Satan, 1
who 1
sows 1
scandal 1
and 1
division 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
— 0
though 0
without 0
ever 0
uttering 0
my 0
name. 0

If 0
he 0
had 0
said: 0
“Viganò 0
lied,” 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
challenged 0
my 0
credibility 0
while 0
trying 0
to 0
affirm 0
his 0
own. 0

In 0
so 0
doing 0
he 0
would 0
have 0
intensified 0
the 0
demand 0
of 0
the 0
people 0
of 0
God 0
and 0
the 0
world 0
for 0
the 0
documentation 0
needed 0
to 0
determine 0
who 0
has 0
told 0
the 0
truth. 0

Instead, 0
he 0
put 0
in 0
place 0
a 0
subtle 0
slander 0
against 0
me 0
— 0
slander 0
being 0
an 0
offense 0
he 0
has 0
often 0
compared 0
to 0
the 0
gravity 0
of 0
murder. 0

Indeed, 0
he 0
did 0
it 0
repeatedly, 0
in 0
the 0
context 0
of 0
the 0
celebration 0
of 0
the 0
most 0
Holy 0
Sacrament, 0
the 0
Eucharist, 0
where 0
he 0
runs 0
no 0
risk 0
of 0
being 0
challenged 0
by 0
journalists. 0

When 0
he 0
did 0
speak 0
to 0
journalists, 0
he 0
asked 0
them 0
to 0
exercise 0
their 0
professional 0
maturity 0
and 0
draw 0
their 0
own 0
conclusions. 0

But 1
how 1
can 1
journalists 1
discover 1
and 1
know 1
the 1
truth 1
if 1
those 1
directly 1
involved 1
with 1
a 1
matter 1
refuse 1
to 1
answer 1
any 1
questions 1
or 1
to 1
release 1
any 1
documents? 1

The 1
pope’s 1
unwillingness 1
to 1
respond 1
to 1
my 1
charges 1
and 1
his 1
deafness 1
to 1
the 1
appeals 1
by 1
the 1
faithful 1
for 1
accountability 1
are 1
hardly 1
consistent 1
with 1
his 1
calls 1
for 1
transparency 1
and 1
bridge 1
building. 1

Moreover, 0
the 0
pope’s 0
cover-up 0
of 0
McCarrick 0
was 0
clearly 0
not 0
an 0
isolated 0
mistake. 0

Many 1
more 1
instances 1
have 1
recently 1
been 1
documented 1
in 1
the 1
press, 1
showing 1
that 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
has 1
defended 1
homosexual 1
clergy 1
who 1
committed 1
serious 1
sexual 1
abuses 1
against 1
minors 1
or 1
adults. 1

These 0
include 0
his 0
role 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
Fr. 0

Julio 0
Grassi 0
in 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
his 0
reinstatement 0
of 0
Fr. 0

Mauro 0
Inzoli 0
after 0
Pope 0
Benedict 0
had 0
removed 0
him 0
from 0
ministry 0
(until 0
he 0
went 0
to 0
prison, 0
at 0
which 0
point 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
laicized 0
him), 0
and 0
his 0
halting 0
of 0
the 0
investigation 0
of 0
sex 0
abuse 0
allegations 0
against 0
Cardinal 0
Cormac 0
Murphy 0
O’Connor. 0

In 0
the 0
meantime, 0
a 0
delegation 0
of 0
the 0
USCCB, 0
headed 0
by 0
its 0
president 0
Cardinal 0
DiNardo, 0
went 0
to 0
Rome 0
asking 0
for 0
a 0
Vatican 0
investigation 0
into 0
McCarrick. 0

Cardinal 0
DiNardo 0
and 0
the 0
other 0
prelates 0
should 0
tell 0
the 0
Church 0
in 0
America 0
and 0
in 0
the 0
world: 0
did 1
the 1
pope 1
refuse 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
a 1
Vatican 1
investigation 1
into 1
McCarrick’s 1
crimes 1
and 1
of 1
those 1
responsible 1
for 1
covering 1
them 1
up? 1

The 1
faithful 1
deserve 1
to 1
know. 1

I 0
would 0
like 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
special 0
appeal 0
to 0
Cardinal 0
Ouellet, 0
because 0
as 0
nuncio 0
I 0
always 0
worked 0
in 0
great 0
harmony 0
with 0
him, 0
and 0
I 0
have 0
always 0
had 0
great 0
esteem 0
and 0
affection 0
towards 0
him. 0

He 0
will 0
remember 0
when, 0
at 0
the 0
end 0
of 0
my 0
mission 0
in 0
Washington, 0
he 0
received 0
me 0
at 0
his 0
apartment 0
in 0
Rome 0
in 0
the 0
evening 0
for 0
a 0
long 0
conversation. 0

At 0
the 0
beginning 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis’ 0
pontificate, 0
he 0
had 0
maintained 0
his 0
dignity, 0
as 0
he 0
had 0
shown 0
with 0
courage 0
when 0
he 0
was 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Québec. 0

Later, 0
however, 0
when 0
his 0
work 0
as 0
prefect 0
of 0
the 0
Congregation 0
for 0
Bishops 0
was 0
being 0
undermined 0
because 0
recommendations 0
for 0
episcopal 0
appointments 0
were 0
being 0
passed 0
directly 0
to 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
by 0
two 1
homosexual 1
“friends” 1
of 1
his 1
dicastery, 1
bypassing 0
the 0
Cardinal, 0
he 0
