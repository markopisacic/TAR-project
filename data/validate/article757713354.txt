Hardly 0 72 13
an 0 72 13
encouragement 0 72 13
for 0 72 13
North 0 72 13
Korea. 0 72 13

North 0 72 14
Korea 0 72 14
was 0 72 14
right 0 72 14
on 0 72 14
target 0 72 14
when 0 72 14
it 0 72 14
accused 0 72 14
arch-neocon 0 72 14
John 0 72 14

of 0 72 14

to 0 72 14
sabotage 0 72 14
the 0 72 14
peace 0 72 14
deal. 0 72 14

In 0 72 15
2005-2006, 0 72 15
Bolton 0 72 15
served 0 72 15
as 0 72 15
the 0 72 15
Bush 0 72 15
administration’s 0 72 15
ambassador 0 72 15
to 0 72 15
the 0 72 15
UN. 0 72 15

He 0 72 16
established 0 72 16
a 0 72 16
tradition 0 72 16
for 0 72 16
the 0 72 16
post 0 72 16
of 0 72 16
being 0 72 16
anti-Muslim, 0 72 16
pro-Israel 0 72 16
and 0 72 16
anti-Russian, 0 72 16
a 0 72 16
policy 0 72 16
continued 0 72 16
to 0 72 16
this 0 72 16

rep, 0 72 16
loud-mouthed 0 72 16

In 0 72 17
the 0 72 17
2005-2006 0 72 17
period, 0 72 17
after 0 72 17
years 0 72 17
of 0 72 17
negotiations, 0 72 17
the 0 72 17
US 0 72 17
and 0 72 17
North 0 72 17
Korea 0 72 17
were 0 72 17
close 0 72 17
to 0 72 17
a 0 72 17
nuclear/peace 0 72 17
deal. 0 72 17

Enter 0 72 18
John 0 72 18
Bolton. 0 72 18

He 0 72 19
succeeded 0 72 19
in 0 72 19
sabotaging 0 72 19
the 0 72 19
US-North 0 72 19
Korea 0 72 19
deal. 0 72 19

Why? 0 72 20

Because 0 72 21
Bolton, 0 72 21
as 0 72 21
an 0 72 21
arch 0 72 21
neocon, 0 72 21
was 0 72 21
fanatically 1 72 21
pro-Israel 0 72 21
and 0 72 21
feared 0 72 21
that 0 72 21
North 0 72 21
Korea 0 72 21
might 0 72 21
provide 0 72 21
nuclear 0 72 21
technology 0 72 21
to 0 72 21
Israel’s 0 72 21
foes. 0 72 21

As 0 72 22
usual 0 72 22
with 0 72 22
the 0 72 22
neocons, 0 72 22
Israel’s 0 72 22
interests 0 72 22
came 0 72 22
before 0 72 22
those 0 72 22
of 0 72 22
the 0 72 22
United 0 72 22
States. 0 72 22

Trump’s 0 72 23
newly 0 72 23
named 0 72 23
Secretary 0 72 23
of 0 72 23
State, 0 72 23
Michael 0 72 23
Pompeo, 0 72 23
is 0 72 23
also 0 72 23
an 0 72 23
ardent 0 72 23
neocon. 0 72 23

Last 0 72 24
week, 0 72 24
Bolton 0 72 24
went 0 72 24
onto 0 72 24
US 0 72 24
TV 0 72 24
and 0 72 24
actually 0 72 24
suggested 0 72 24
North 0 72 24
Korea 0 72 24
might 0 72 24
follow 0 72 24
the 0 72 24
course 0 72 24
set 0 72 24
by 0 72 24
Libya, 0 72 24
of 0 72 24
all 0 72 24
places. 0 72 24

Libya’s 0 72 25
then 0 72 25
ruler, 0 72 25
Muammar 0 72 25
Kadaffi, 0 72 25
bought 0 72 25
some 0 72 25
nuclear 0 72 25
equipment 0 72 25
from 0 72 25
Pakistan 0 72 25
so 0 72 25
he 0 72 25
could 0 72 25
hand 0 72 25
it 0 72 25
over 0 72 25
to 0 72 25
the 0 72 25
US 0 72 25
as 0 72 25
a 0 72 25
gesture 0 72 25
of 0 72 25
cooperation 0 72 25
after 0 72 25
the 0 72 25
Bush 0 72 25
administration 0 72 25
invaded 0 72 25
Iraq. 0 72 25

The 0 72 26
handover 0 72 26
was 0 72 26
done 0 72 26
with 0 72 26
much 1 72 26
fanfare, 1 72 26
then 0 72 26
the 0 72 26
US, 0 72 26
France 0 72 26
and 0 72 26
Britain 0 72 26
attacked 0 72 26
Libya 0 72 26
and 0 72 26
overthrew 0 72 26
Kadaffi. 0 72 26

The 0 72 27
hapless 1 72 27
Libyan 0 72 27
leader 0 72 27
was 0 72 27
eventually 0 72 27
murdered 0 72 27
by 0 72 27
French 0 72 27

Is 1 72 29
this 1 72 29
what 1 72 29
Bolton 1 72 29
has 1 72 29
in 1 72 29

North 1 72 29

certainly 0 72 30
seemed 0 72 30
to 0 72 30

Bolton 0 72 31

perhaps 0 72 31

were 0 72 32
at 0 72 32

being 0 72 32
incredibly 1 72 32
obtuse 1 72 32

Was 1 72 33

in 1 72 33
this 1 72 33
intrigue? 1 72 33

Hard 0 72 34
to 0 72 34
tell. 0 72 34

But 0 72 35
he 0 72 35
can’t 0 72 35

rather 0 72 36
ahead 0 72 36
of 0 72 36

Or 0 72 37
was 0 72 37
the 0 72 37

military 0 72 37
rattling 0 72 37

a 0 72 38
dim 0 72 38
