A 0
rough 0
patch—or 0
a 0
double-dip 0
recession? 0

Economists 0
are 0
increasingly 1
befuddled 1
at 0
what 0
awaits 0
the 0
once-great 0
U.S. 0
economy. 0

And 0
Wall 0
Street 0
is 0
plainly 0
beginning 0
to 0
panic. 0

Unemployment 0
is 0
a 0
case 0
in 0
point. 0

It 0
now 0
seems 0
obvious 0
that 0
one 0
of 0
those 0
mysterious 1
memos 1
has 0
gone 0
out 0
to 0
the 0
Main 0
Stream 0
Media 0
saying 0
that 0
no-one 0
can 0
mention 0
the 0
immigration 0
moratorium 0
solution. 0

But 0
unemployment 0
is 0
befuddling 0
anyway. 0

Just 0
a 0
few 0
weeks 0
ago 0
professional 0
prognosticators 0
were 0
expecting 0
job 0
growth 0
of 0
175,000 0
in 0
May. 0

However, 0
nonfarm 0
payroll 0
growth 0
came 0
in 0
at 0
54,000 0
in 0
May, 0
the 0
smallest 0
gain 0
since 0
September, 0
and 0
a 0
fraction 0
of 0
the 0
just 0
lowered 0
consensus 0
forecast 0
(125,000 0
jobs.) 0

The 0
"other" 0
employment 0
survey, 0
of 0
households 0
rather 0
than 0
businesses, 0
also 0
broadcast 0
mixed 0
signals—at 0
least 0
so 0
far 0
as 0
the 0
prospects 0
for 0
native-born 0
workers 0
are 0
concerned. 0

VDARE.com 0
has 0
long 0
argued 0
that 0
the 0
household 0
survey 0
captures 0
the 0
employment 0
of 0
illegal 0
aliens; 0
additionally, 0
it 0
actually 0

In 0
May, 0
according 0
to 0
the 0
Household 0
Survey, 0
total 0
employment 0
rose 0
by 0
105,000. 0

Non-Hispanics 0

Thus 0
VDAWDI—VDARE.com's 0
American 0
Worker 0
Displacement 0
Index, 0
unveiled 0
in 0
2004 0
and 0
still 0

126.2 0
in 0
May 0
from 0
April's 0
127.0 0
level. 0

This, 0
of 0

is 0
atypical 0
statistical 0
noise. 0

Non-Hispanics 0
have 0
lost 0

at 0
twice 0
the 0
rate 0
of 0
Hispanics 0
since 0
the 0
recession 0
hit 0
in 0
December 0
2007. 0

And 0
since 0

of 0
the 0
"recovery" 0
in 0
June 0
2009, 0
Hispanics 0

gained 0
416,000 0
jobs 0
while 0
non-Hispanics 0
have 0
lost 0
675,000 0
positions. 0

Step 0
back 0
further 0
and 0
the 1
picture 1
is 1
still 1
bleaker. 1

Since 0
January 0
2001 0
the 0
number 0

holding 0

Over 0

rose 0
by 0
3.9 0

up 0
a 0

Simply 1

the 1
21st 1

has 1
not 1
been 1
good 1
for 1

We 0
tracked 0

because 0
such 0
a 0
