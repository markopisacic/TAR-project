For 0 64 11
Chris 0 64 11
Bryant, 0 64 11
apparently 0 64 11
“fascism” 0 64 11
means 0 64 11

Why 0 64 13
are 0 64 13
we 0 64 13
“far 0 64 13

Everything 0 64 14

“far 0 64 15

In 0 64 16
any 0 64 16

well: 0 64 16

one 1 64 20
of 1 64 20
five 1 64 20
things. 1 64 20

One 1 64 21
– 1 64 21
the 1 64 21
easiest 1 64 21
one 1 64 21
maybe 1 64 21
– 1 64 21

head 1 64 21
off, 1 64 21
that’s 1 64 21
the 1 64 21
easiest. 1 64 21

Second 1 64 22
– 1 64 22
burn 1 64 22
them 1 64 22
to 1 64 22
death. 1 64 22

Third 1 64 23
– 1 64 23
throw 1 64 23
’em 1 64 23
off 1 64 23
a 1 64 23
cliff. 1 64 23

Fourth 1 64 24
– 1 64 24

down 1 64 24
a 1 64 24
wall 1 64 24

so 1 64 24
they 1 64 24
die 1 64 24
under 1 64 24
that. 1 64 24

Fifth 1 64 25
– 1 64 25
a 1 64 25
combination 1 64 25
of 1 64 25
the 1 64 25
above.” 1 64 25
