at 0 176 7

economically 0 176 7
with 0 176 7

on 0 176 7

Those 0 176 8
conflicts, 0 176 8
mostly 0 176 8
centered 0 176 8
on 0 176 8

One 0 176 9
thing 0 176 9
to 0 176 9
note 0 176 9
is 0 176 9
that 0 176 9

not 1 176 9

it's 1 176 9
the 1 176 9

"only 1 176 9

In 0 176 10

of 0 176 10
Muslim 0 176 10
migrants 0 176 10
into 0 176 10
Europe, 0 176 10
Orban 0 176 10
sees 0 176 10
it 0 176 10
as 0 176 10
destroying 0 176 10
the 0 176 10
culture 0 176 10
of 0 176 10
Europe 0 176 10
and 0 176 10
referred 0 176 10
to 0 176 10
it 0 176 10
as 0 176 10
an 0 176 10
“immigrant 0 176 10

Orban 0 176 11
then 0 176 11

out 0 176 11

in 0 176 11

“Absurd 0 176 12

it 0 176 12

sound 0 176 12
the 0 176 12

face 0 176 12

Orban 0 176 20

he 0 176 20
anticipated 0 176 20
that 0 176 20
powerful 0 176 20

would 0 176 20
help 0 176 20

“Soros 0 176 21

“The 0 176 26
