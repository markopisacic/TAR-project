Rep. 0
Ron 0
DeSantis 0
(R-FL) 0
accuses 0
the 0
Republican 0
House 0
leadership 0
of 0
dragging 0
their 0
heels 0
in 0
the 0
Spygate 0
investigation. 0

This 0
has 0
been 0
evident 0
for 0
months 0
now, 0
as 0
there 0
are 0
many 0
connections 0
and 0
obvious 0
questions 0
that 0
haven’t 0
been 0
investigated. 0

The 0
FBI 0
files 0
contain 0
memos 0
that 0
need 0
to 0
be 0
scoured 0
too. 0

The 0
House 0
leaders 0
are 0
Paul 0
Ryan 0
(Speaker 0
of 0
the 0
House), 0
Kevin 0
McCarthy 0
(Majority 0
Leader), 0
Steve 0
Scalise 0
(Majority 0
Whip) 0
and 0
Cathy 0
McMorris 0
Rodgers 0
(House 0
Republican 0
Conference 0
Chair). 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
decided 0
lack 0
of 0
aggressiveness 0
of 0
this 0
investigation. 0

One 0
source 0
is 0
Paul 0
Ryan: 0
Evidence: 0
“House 0
Speaker 0
Paul 0
Ryan 0
said 0
Wednesday 0
that 0
Oversight 0
Chairman 0
Trey 0
Gowdy 0
was 0
‘accurate’ 0
when 0
he 0
argued 0
the 0
FBI 0
has 0
acted 0
appropriately 0
in 0
its 0
ongoing 0
probe 0
of 0
potential 0
Russian 0
links 0
to 0
the 0
Trump 0
campaign.” 0
How 1
could 1
Ryan 1
possibly 1
know 1
this? 1

Isn’t 1
he 1
prejudging 1
the 1
case 1
without 1
even 1
finding 1
out 1
what 1
actually 1
happened? 1

If 0
Ryan 0
is 0
correct, 0
an 0
investigation 0
will 0
show 0
it; 0
but 0
the 0
current 0
evidence 0
suggests 0
he 0
is 0
wrong. 0

By 0
short-circuiting 0
the 0
investigation, 0
Ryan 0
is 0
betraying 1
the 1
interest 1
of 1
the 1
American 1
people 1
to 0
learn 0
what 0
the 0
FBI 0
and 0
CIA 0
actually 0
did 0
against 0
Trump. 0

Another 0
Republican 0
who 0
wants 0
to 0
stop 0
investigating 0
is 0
former 0
RNC 0
Chair, 0
Michael 0
Steele: 0
“There 0
is 0
no 0
Spygate 0
because 0
there 0
are 0
no 0
spies 0
in 0
the 0
campaign.” 0
The 0
attitude 0
of 0
Steve 0
Scalise 0
is 0
wishy-washy. 1

He’s 0
open 0
to 0
a 0
special 0
prosecutor, 0
but 0
his 0
responses 0
come 0
across 0
as 0
passive, 0
lacking 1
push, 1
zeal 1
and 1
enthusiasm 1
to 0
delve 0
deeply 0
into 0
Spygate. 0

There 0
is 0
a 0
kind 0
of 0
coverup 0
at 0
work 0
here 0
in 0
which 0
important 0
Republicans 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
bolster 0
Trump 0
by 0
adding 0
substance 0
to 0
Spygate, 0
and 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
want 0
to 0
clean 0
up 0
the 0
FBI 0
by 0
aggressively 0
investigating 0
Spygate 0
further. 0

They 0
don’t 0
want 0
the 1
rotten 1
inner 1
workings 1
of 0
the 0
organization 0
to 0
be 0
aired 0
publicly. 0

They 1
want 1
to 1
preserve 1
the 1
FBI’s 1
reputation. 1

They 1
don’t 1
care 1
to 1
see 1
Trump 1
vindicated. 1

The 0
contrast 0
with 0
the 0
Watergate 0
investigation 0
and 0
hearings 0
is 0
startling. 1
