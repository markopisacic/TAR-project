Incredibly, 0 82 9
Swetnick 0 82 9

kept 0 82 9
on 0 82 9
attending 0 82 9
them 0 82 9
anyway. 0 82 9

It 0 82 10
gets 0 82 10
weirder. 0 82 10

Kavanaugh 0 82 11
was 0 82 11
a 1 82 11
“mean 1 82 11
drunk,” 1 82 11
she 0 82 11
stated. 0 82 11

He 0 82 12
drank 0 82 12
excessively 0 82 12
at 0 82 12
these 0 82 12
parties 0 82 12
and 0 82 12
would 0 82 12
grind 0 82 12

and 0 82 13
his 0 82 13

she 0 82 13
was 0 82 13
raped, 0 82 13
she 0 82 13
states, 0 82 13

she 0 82 13

in 0 82 13
it. 0 82 13

In 0 82 14
response, 0 82 14
Kavanaugh 0 82 14
labeled 0 82 14
Swetnick's 0 82 14
salacious 0 82 14
allegations 0 82 14

"I 0 82 15

She 0 82 20
said 0 82 20
Kavanaugh 0 82 20
and 0 82 20
Judge 0 82 20
engaged 0 82 20
in 0 82 20
"abusive 0 82 20

"included 0 82 20

taking 0 82 20

The 0 82 37
transcript 0 82 37
of 0 82 37
Kavanaugh's 0 82 37
Tuesday 0 82 37
interview 0 82 37
also 0 82 37
cited 0 82 37
another 0 82 37
anonymous 0 82 37
claim 0 82 37
of 0 82 37
sexual 0 82 37
misconduct 0 82 37
involving 0 82 37
Kavanaugh, 0 82 37
dating 0 82 37
back 0 82 37
to 0 82 37
1985 0 82 37
and 0 82 37
sent 0 82 37
to 0 82 37
the 0 82 37
office 0 82 37
of 0 82 37
Sen. 0 82 37
Sheldon 0 82 37
Whitehouse 0 82 37
(D-R.I.), 0 82 37
which 0 82 37
the 0 82 37
judge 0 82 37
also 0 82 37
flatly 0 82 37
denied 0 82 37
to 0 82 37
investigators. 0 82 37

And 0 82 38
GOP 0 82 38
investigators 0 82 38
said 0 82 38
late 0 82 38
Wednesday 0 82 38
they 0 82 38
received 0 82 38
an 0 82 38
additional 0 82 38
anonymous 0 82 38
claim 0 82 38
of 0 82 38
rape 0 82 38
passed 0 82 38
along 0 82 38
by 0 82 38
Sen. 0 82 38
Kamala 0 82 38
Harris 0 82 38

Accuser 0 82 39
number 0 82 39
two 0 82 39
is 0 82 39
Deborah 0 82 39
Ramirez, 0 82 39
53, 0 82 39
who 0 82 39
went 0 82 39
public 0 82 39
with 0 82 39
her 0 82 39
claims 0 82 39
in 0 82 39
a 0 82 39
New 0 82 39
Yorker 0 82 39
magazine 0 82 39
article 0 82 39
Sunday. 0 82 39

Ramirez 0 82 40
alleges 0 82 40
she 0 82 40
was 0 82 40
assaulted 0 82 40
by 0 82 40
Kavanaugh 0 82 40
at 0 82 40
a 0 82 40
drunken 0 82 40
party 0 82 40
decades 0 82 40
ago 0 82 40
at 0 82 40
Yale 0 82 40
College. 0 82 40

She 0 82 41
claims 0 82 41
Kavanaugh 0 82 41
exposed 0 82 41
himself 0 82 41
to 0 82 41
her 0 82 41
and 0 82 41
brushed 0 82 41
his 0 82 41
genitals 0 82 41
against 0 82 41
her. 0 82 41

If 0 82 42
Kavanaugh 0 82 42
isn’t 0 82 42
on 0 82 42
the 0 82 42
bench 0 82 42
Monday, 0 82 42
the 0 82 42
Supreme 0 82 42
Court 0 82 42
will 0 82 42
be 0 82 42
shorthanded 0 82 42
as 0 82 42
it 0 82 42
begins 0 82 42
hearing 0 82 42
cases 0 82 42
in 0 82 42
its 0 82 42
new 0 82 42
term. 0 82 42

It 0 82 43
normally 0 82 43
has 0 82 43
a 0 82 43
complement 0 82 43
of 0 82 43
nine 0 82 43
justices 0 82 43
but 0 82 43
with 0 82 43
Anthony 0 82 43
Kennedy’s 0 82 43
retirement 0 82 43
July 0 82 43
31, 0 82 43
which 0 82 43
cleared 0 82 43
the 0 82 43
way 0 82 43
for 0 82 43
Kavanaugh’s 0 82 43
nomination, 0 82 43
there 0 82 43
have 0 82 43
been 0 82 43
only 0 82 43
eight 0 82 43
justices. 0 82 43

Roughly 0 82 44
speaking 0 82 44
there 0 82 44
is 0 82 44
a 0 82 44
4-to-4 0 82 44
liberal 0 82 44
to 0 82 44
conservative 0 82 44
ideological 0 82 44
split 0 82 44
on 0 82 44
the 0 82 44
court. 0 82 44

Democrats 0 82 45
are 0 82 45
trying 0 82 45
to 0 82 45
drag 0 82 45
the 0 82 45
confirmation 0 82 45
process 0 82 45
into 0 82 45
the 0 82 45
next 0 82 45
Congress 0 82 45
where 0 82 45
they 0 82 45
may 0 82 45
seize 0 82 45
control 0 82 45
from 0 82 45
Republicans. 0 82 45

Election 0 82 46
Day 0 82 46
is 0 82 46
November 0 82 46
6. 0 82 46

The 0 82 47
GOP 0 82 47
currently 0 82 47
controls 0 82 47
the 0 82 47
Senate, 0 82 47
which 0 82 47
has 0 82 47
the 0 82 47
final 0 82 47
say 0 82 47
on 0 82 47
judicial 0 82 47
nominations, 0 82 47
by 0 82 47
an 0 82 47
uncomfortably 0 82 47
close 0 82 47
margin 0 82 47
of 0 82 47
51 0 82 47
to 0 82 47
49. 0 82 47

The 0 82 48
proceedings 0 82 48
Thursday 0 82 48
are 0 82 48
supposed 0 82 48
to 0 82 48
get 0 82 48
underway 0 82 48
at 0 82 48
10:00 0 82 48
a.m. 0 82 48
Eastern 0 82 48
time. 0 82 48

Committee 0 82 49
Republicans 0 82 49
considered 0 82 49
the 0 82 49
political 0 82 49
optics 0 82 49
and 0 82 49
didn’t 0 82 49
relish 0 82 49
the 0 82 49
prospect 0 82 49
of 0 82 49
their 0 82 49
all-male 1 82 49
team 1 82 49
of 0 82 49
11 0 82 49
senators 0 82 49
questioning 0 82 49
a 0 82 49
woman 0 82 49
so 0 82 49
they 0 82 49
hired 0 82 49
sex-crimes 0 82 49
prosecutor 0 82 49
Rachel 0 82 49
Mitchell 0 82 49
of 0 82 49
Maricopa 0 82 49
County, 0 82 49
Arizona, 0 82 49
to 0 82 49
ask 0 82 49
the 0 82 49
questions 0 82 49
at 0 82 49
what 0 82 49
promises 0 82 49
to 0 82 49
be 0 82 49
a 0 82 49
highly-watched 0 82 49
hearing. 0 82 49

Democrats 0 82 50
predictably 0 82 50
freaked 1 82 50
out 1 82 50
at 0 82 50
the 0 82 50
decision 0 82 50
to 0 82 50
have 0 82 50
a 0 82 50
woman 0 82 50
lead 0 82 50
the 0 82 50
questioning 0 82 50
since 0 82 50
their 0 82 50
primary 0 82 50
objective 0 82 50
here 0 82 50
is 0 82 50
to 0 82 50
embarrass 0 82 50
and 0 82 50
discredit 0 82 50
Kavanaugh 0 82 50
and 0 82 50
other 0 82 50
Republicans, 0 82 50
not 0 82 50
get 0 82 50
at 0 82 50
the 0 82 50
truth. 0 82 50

“It 0 82 51
is 0 82 51
going 0 82 51
against 0 82 51
everything 0 82 51
I’ve 0 82 51
seen 0 82 51
for 0 82 51
44 0 82 51
years," 0 82 51
huffed 0 82 51
committee 0 82 51
member 0 82 51
Patrick 0 82 51
Leahy 0 82 51
(D-Vt.). 0 82 51

"They’re 0 82 52
not 0 82 52
following 0 82 52
normal 0 82 52
procedure." 0 82 52

As 0 82 53
expected, 0 82 53
at 0 82 53
today’s 0 82 53
hearing 0 82 53
Kavanaugh 0 82 53
will 0 82 53
firmly 0 82 53
rebut 0 82 53
the 0 82 53
increasingly 0 82 53
outrageous 0 82 53
claims 0 82 53
being 0 82 53
leveled 0 82 53
at 0 82 53
him. 0 82 53

According 0 82 54
to 0 82 54
prepared 0 82 54
testimony 0 82 54
provided 0 82 54
to 0 82 54
The 0 82 54
Hill 0 82 54
newspaper, 0 82 54
he 0 82 54
will 0 82 54
say: 0 82 54

I 0 82 55
categorically 1 82 55
and 1 82 55
unequivocally 1 82 55
deny 1 82 55
the 0 82 55
allegation 0 82 55
against 0 82 55
me 0 82 55
by 0 82 55
Dr. 0 82 55
Ford. 0 82 55

I 0 82 56
never 0 82 56
had 0 82 56
any 0 82 56
sexual 0 82 56
or 0 82 56
physical 0 82 56
encounter 0 82 56
of 0 82 56
any 0 82 56
kind 0 82 56
with 0 82 56
Dr. 0 82 56
Ford. 0 82 56

I 0 82 57
am 0 82 57
not 0 82 57
questioning 0 82 57
that 0 82 57
Dr. 0 82 57
Ford 0 82 57
may 0 82 57
have 0 82 57
been 0 82 57
sexually 0 82 57
assaulted 0 82 57
by 0 82 57
some 0 82 57
person 0 82 57
in 0 82 57
some 0 82 57
place 0 82 57
at 0 82 57
some 0 82 57
time. 0 82 57

But 0 82 58
I 0 82 58
have 0 82 58
never 0 82 58
done 0 82 58
that 0 82 58
to 0 82 58
her 0 82 58
or 0 82 58
to 0 82 58
anyone. 0 82 58

Kavanaugh 0 82 59
added: 0 82 59
"I 0 82 59
am 0 82 59
innocent 0 82 59
of 0 82 59
this 0 82 59
charge." 0 82 59

Not 0 82 60
surprisingly 0 82 60
Ford’s 0 82 60
prepared 0 82 60
testimony 0 82 60
also 0 82 60
found 0 82 60
its 0 82 60
way 0 82 60
to 0 82 60
reporters. 0 82 60

“I 0 82 61
am 0 82 61
here 0 82 61
today 0 82 61
not 0 82 61
because 0 82 61
I 0 82 61
want 0 82 61
to 0 82 61
be,” 0 82 61
Ford 0 82 61
says 0 82 61
in 0 82 61
her 0 82 61
opening 0 82 61
statement. 0 82 61

“I 0 82 62
am 1 82 62
terrified. 1 82 62

I 0 82 63
am 0 82 63
here 0 82 63
because 0 82 63
I 0 82 63
believe 0 82 63
it 0 82 63
is 0 82 63
my 0 82 63
civic 0 82 63
duty 0 82 63
to 0 82 63
tell 0 82 63
you 0 82 63
what 0 82 63
happened 0 82 63
to 0 82 63
me 0 82 63
while 0 82 63
Brett 0 82 63
Kavanaugh 0 82 63
and 0 82 63
I 0 82 63
were 0 82 63
in 0 82 63
high 0 82 63
school.” 0 82 63

She 0 82 64
describes 0 82 64
the 0 82 64
nominee 0 82 64
as 0 82 64
“Brett 1 82 64
Kavanaugh, 1 82 64
the 1 82 64
boy 1 82 64
who 1 82 64
sexually 1 82 64
assaulted 1 82 64
me,” 1 82 64
and 0 82 64
claims 0 82 64
“Brett’s 0 82 64
assault 0 82 64
on 0 82 64
me 0 82 64
drastically 1 82 64
altered 1 82 64
my 1 82 64
life,” 1 82 64
but 0 82 64
at 0 82 64
the 0 82 64
same 0 82 64
time 0 82 64
acknowledges 0 82 64
“Brett 0 82 64
did 0 82 64
not 0 82 64
rape 0 82 64
me.” 0 82 64

Given 0 82 65
that 0 82 65
Kavanaugh 0 82 65
has 0 82 65
already 0 82 65
passed 0 82 65
six 0 82 65
incredibly 0 82 65
intrusive 0 82 65
FBI 0 82 65
investigations, 0 82 65
odds 0 82 65
are 0 82 65
Ford 1 82 65
is 1 82 65
lying 1 82 65
or 1 82 65
suffering 1 82 65
from 1 82 65
some 1 82 65
kind 1 82 65
of 1 82 65
psychological 1 82 65
disorder 1 82 65
such 1 82 65
as 1 82 65
false 1 82 65
memory 1 82 65
syndrome. 1 82 65

Many 0 82 66
commentators 0 82 66
have 0 82 66
drawn 0 82 66
parallels 0 82 66
between 0 82 66
Ford 0 82 66
and 0 82 66
Anita 0 82 66
Hill, 0 82 66
who 0 82 66
in 0 82 66
1991 0 82 66
accused 0 82 66
then-Supreme 0 82 66
Court 0 82 66
nominee 0 82 66
Clarence 0 82 66
Thomas 0 82 66
of 0 82 66
sexual 0 82 66
improprieties. 0 82 66

Both 0 82 67
women 0 82 67
are 0 82 67
college 0 82 67
professors. 0 82 67

Both 0 82 68
claim 0 82 68
to 0 82 68
have 0 82 68
reluctantly 0 82 68
been 0 82 68
drawn 0 82 68
into 0 82 68
confirmation 0 82 68
battles. 0 82 68

Ford 0 82 69
claims 0 82 69
to 0 82 69
be 0 82 69
a 0 82 69
victim 0 82 69
of 0 82 69
attempted 0 82 69
rape; 0 82 69
Hill 0 82 69
claims 0 82 69
to 0 82 69
have 0 82 69
been 0 82 69
a 0 82 69
victim 0 82 69
of 0 82 69
sexual 0 82 69
harassment 0 82 69
in 0 82 69
the 0 82 69
workplace. 0 82 69

Only 0 82 70
left-wingers 1 82 70
and 1 82 70
feminists 1 82 70
like 1 82 70
Maureen 1 82 70
Dowd 1 82 70
still 0 82 70
believe 0 82 70
Hill, 0 82 70
now 0 82 70
an 0 82 70
utterly 1 82 70
undistinguished 1 82 70
politically 1 82 70
correct 1 82 70
scholar 1 82 70
who 0 82 70
discredited 0 82 70
herself 0 82 70
by 0 82 70
–among 0 82 70
other 0 82 70
things— 0 82 70
following 0 82 70
her 0 82 70
then-boss 0 82 70
Thomas 0 82 70
as 0 82 70
his 0 82 70
subordinate 0 82 70
when 0 82 70
he 0 82 70
switched 0 82 70
jobs. 0 82 70

An 0 82 71
abused 0 82 71
person 0 82 71
wouldn’t 0 82 71
do 0 82 71
that. 0 82 71

But 0 82 72
all 0 82 72
the 0 82 72
lies 0 82 72
about 0 82 72
Thomas 0 82 72
at 0 82 72
what 0 82 72
he 0 82 72
described 0 82 72
as 0 82 72
a 0 82 72
“high-tech 1 82 72
lynching 1 82 72
for 1 82 72
uppity 1 82 72
blacks” 1 82 72
had 0 82 72
an 0 82 72
effect. 0 82 72

In 0 82 73
the 0 82 73
end, 0 82 73
the 0 82 73
Senate 0 82 73
barely 0 82 73
approved 0 82 73
his 0 82 73
nomination 0 82 73
52 0 82 73
to 0 82 73
48 0 82 73
on 0 82 73
October 0 82 73
15, 0 82 73
1991. 0 82 73

With 0 82 74
all 0 82 74
the 0 82 74
mud 1 82 74
Democrats 1 82 74
have 1 82 74
been 1 82 74
slinging 1 82 74
at 1 82 74
Kavanaugh, 0 82 74
he 0 82 74
would 0 82 74
be 0 82 74
thrilled 0 82 74
to 0 82 74
be 0 82 74
approved 0 82 74
by 0 82 74
a 0 82 74
margin 0 82 74
as 0 82 74
wide 0 82 74
as 0 82 74
52 0 82 74
to 0 82 74
48. 0 82 74

Conservatives 0 82 75
need 0 82 75
to 0 82 75
remember 0 82 75
that 0 82 75
the 1 82 75
purpose 1 82 75
of 1 82 75
the 1 82 75
Left’s 1 82 75
frenzied, 1 82 75
demagogic 1 82 75
assault 1 82 75
