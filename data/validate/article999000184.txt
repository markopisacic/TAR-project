Ilhan 0 53 1
Omar 0 53 1

have 1 53 1
been 1 53 1

elected 1 53 1
to 0 53 1
Congress. 0 53 1

The 0 53 2
establishment 0 53 2
media 0 53 2
will 0 53 2
celebrate 0 53 2
these 0 53 2
victories 0 53 2
as 0 53 2
triumphs 1 53 2
of 1 53 2
America’s 1 53 2

unfortunately, 1 53 2
in 1 53 2
reality 1 53 2
neither 1 53 2
one 1 53 2
is 1 53 2
worth 1 53 2
celebrating. 1 53 2

Tlaib 0 53 3
is 0 53 3
a 0 53 3
vociferous 0 53 3
foe 0 53 3
of 0 53 3
Israel. 0 53 3

With 0 53 4
the 0 53 4
Democrats 0 53 4
now 0 53 4
regaining 0 53 4
control 0 53 4
of 0 53 4
the 0 53 4
House, 0 53 4
Tlaib 0 53 4
is 0 53 4
likely 0 53 4
to 0 53 4
be 0 53 4
an 0 53 4
energetic 0 53 4
proponent 0 53 4
of 0 53 4
the 0 53 4
new 0 53 4
majority’s 0 53 4
vendetta 1 53 4
against 1 53 4
the 0 53 4
Middle 0 53 4
East’s 0 53 4
only 0 53 4
democracy. 0 53 4

The 0 53 5
House 0 53 5
is 0 53 5
likely 0 53 5
to 0 53 5
do 0 53 5
all 0 53 5
it 0 53 5
can 0 53 5
to 0 53 5
roll 0 53 5
back 0 53 5
President 0 53 5
Trump’s 0 53 5
pro-Israel 0 53 5
polices, 0 53 5
with 0 53 5
Tlaib 0 53 5
as 0 53 5
well 0 53 5
as 0 53 5
Omar 0 53 5
as 0 53 5
becoming 0 53 5
the 0 53 5
public 0 53 5
faces 0 53 5
of 0 53 5
the 0 53 5
effort. 0 53 5

According 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
the 0 53 6
JTA, 0 53 6
when 0 53 6
Tlaib 0 53 6
was 0 53 6
asked 0 53 6
if 0 53 6
she 0 53 6
would 0 53 6
vote 0 53 6
against 0 53 6
military 0 53 6
aid 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
Israel, 0 53 6
Tlaib 0 53 6
responded: 0 53 6
“Absolutely, 0 53 6
if 0 53 6
it 0 53 6
has 0 53 6
something 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
do 0 53 6
with 0 53 6
inequality 0 53 6
and 0 53 6
not 0 53 6
access 0 53 6
to 0 53 6
people 0 53 6
having 0 53 6
justice. 0 53 6

For 1 53 7
me, 1 53 7
U.S. 1 53 7
aid 1 53 7
should 1 53 7
be 1 53 7
leverage. 1 53 7

I 1 53 8
will 1 53 8
be 1 53 8
using 1 53 8
my 1 53 8
position 1 53 8
in 1 53 8
Congress 1 53 8
so 1 53 8
that 1 53 8
no 1 53 8
country, 1 53 8
not 1 53 8
one, 1 53 8
should 1 53 8
be 1 53 8
able 1 53 8
to 1 53 8
get 1 53 8
aid 1 53 8
from 1 53 8
the 1 53 8
U.S. 1 53 8
when 1 53 8
they 1 53 8
still 1 53 8
promote 1 53 8
that 1 53 8
kind 1 53 8
of 1 53 8
injustice.” 1 53 8

What 0 53 9
kind 0 53 9
of 0 53 9
injustice? 0 53 9

Tlaib, 1 53 10
of 1 53 10
course, 1 53 10
had 1 53 10
nothing 1 53 10
to 1 53 10
say 1 53 10
about 1 53 10
the 1 53 10
genocidal 1 53 10
incitement 1 53 10
against 1 53 10
Jews 1 53 10
and 1 53 10
Israel 1 53 10
that 1 53 10
regularly 1 53 10
features 1 53 10
on 1 53 10
Palestinian 1 53 10
television. 1 53 10

She 0 53 11
did 0 53 11
say, 0 53 11
however, 0 53 11
that 0 53 11
she 0 53 11
favors 0 53 11
a 0 53 11
one-state, 0 53 11
not 0 53 11
two-state, 0 53 11
“solution” 0 53 11
to 0 53 11
the 0 53 11
Israeli-Palestinian 0 53 11
conflict: 0 53 11
“One 0 53 11
state. 0 53 11

It 0 53 12
has 0 53 12
to 0 53 12
be 0 53 12
one 0 53 12
state. 0 53 12

Separate 0 53 13
but 0 53 13
equal 0 53 13
does 0 53 13
not 0 53 13
work. 0 53 13

I’m 0 53 14
only 0 53 14
42 0 53 14
years 0 53 14
old 0 53 14
but 0 53 14
my 0 53 14
teachers 0 53 14
were 0 53 14
of 0 53 14
that 0 53 14
generation 0 53 14
that 0 53 14
marched 0 53 14
with 0 53 14
Martin 0 53 14
Luther 0 53 14
King. 0 53 14

This 0 53 15
whole 0 53 15
idea 0 53 15
of 0 53 15
a 0 53 15
two-state 0 53 15
solution, 0 53 15
it 1 53 15
doesn’t 1 53 15
work.” 1 53 15

Indeed 0 53 16
it 0 53 16
doesn’t. 0 53 16

A 0 53 17
Palestinian 0 53 17
state 0 53 17
would 0 53 17
be 0 53 17
a 0 53 17
new 0 53 17
base 0 53 17
for 0 53 17
renewed 0 53 17
jihad 0 53 17
attacks 0 53 17
against 0 53 17
Israel. 0 53 17

But 0 53 18
a 0 53 18
“one-state 0 53 18
solution” 0 53 18
would 0 53 18
be 0 53 18
even 0 53 18
worse, 0 53 18
unless 0 53 18
that 0 53 18
state 0 53 18
is 0 53 18
the 0 53 18
current 0 53 18
State 0 53 18
of 0 53 18
Israel, 0 53 18
but 0 53 18
that 0 53 18
is 0 53 18
not 0 53 18
the 0 53 18
one 0 53 18
state 0 53 18
Tlaib 0 53 18
has 0 53 18
in 0 53 18
mind. 0 53 18

She 0 53 19
is 0 53 19
calling 0 53 19
for 0 53 19
an 0 53 19
Israeli/Palestinian 0 53 19
state 0 53 19
that 0 53 19
would 0 53 19
not 0 53 19
be 0 53 19
a 0 53 19
Jewish 0 53 19
State 0 53 19
or 0 53 19
a 0 53 19
homeland 0 53 19
for 0 53 19
the 0 53 19
Jewish 0 53 19
people, 0 53 19
but 0 53 19
a 0 53 19
federation 0 53 19
in 0 53 19
which 0 53 19
Palestinians 0 53 19
would 0 53 19
soon 0 53 19
overwhelm 0 53 19
Jews 0 53 19
demographically. 0 53 19

Progressive 0 53 20
denial 0 53 20
of 0 53 20
their 0 53 20
rights 0 53 20
would 0 53 20
soon 0 53 20
follow: 0 53 20
as 0 53 20
I 0 53 20
show 0 53 20
in 0 53 20
my 0 53 20
book 0 53 20
The 0 53 20
History 0 53 20
of 0 53 20
Jihad 0 53 20
From 0 53 20
Muhammad 0 53 20
to 0 53 20
ISIS, 0 53 20
there 0 53 20
has 0 53 20
never 0 53 20
been 0 53 20
a 0 53 20
majority 0 53 20
Muslim 0 53 20
nation 0 53 20
in 0 53 20
which 0 53 20
Jews 0 53 20
enjoyed 0 53 20
equality 0 53 20
of 0 53 20
rights 0 53 20
with 0 53 20
Muslims. 0 53 20

Tlaib’s 0 53 21
unitary 0 53 21
state 0 53 21
would 0 53 21
be 0 53 21
no 0 53 21
different. 0 53 21

The 0 53 22
hijabed 0 53 22
(and 0 53 22
therefore 0 53 22
pro-Sharia) 0 53 22
Ilhan 0 53 22
Omar, 0 53 22
meanwhile, 0 53 22
is 1 53 22
even 1 53 22
more 1 53 22
hateful 1 53 22
than 1 53 22
Tlaib. 1 53 22

According 0 53 23
to 0 53 23
the 0 53 23
Daily 0 53 23
Wire, 0 53 23
in 0 53 23
2012 0 53 23
Omar 0 53 23
tweeted: 0 53 23
“Israel 0 53 23
has 0 53 23

of 1 53 23
Israel. 1 53 23

#Gaza 0 53 24
#Palestine 0 53 24
#Israel.” 0 53 24
Challenged 0 53 24
about 0 53 24
this 0 53 24
tweet 0 53 24
much 0 53 24
more 0 53 24
recently, 0 53 24
she 1 53 24
doubled 1 53 24
down 1 53 24
and 1 53 24
attacked 1 53 24
the 0 53 24
man 0 53 24
who 0 53 24
called 0 53 24
attention 0 53 24
to 0 53 24
the 0 53 24
tweet: 0 53 24
“Drawing 0 53 24
attention 0 53 24
to 0 53 24
the 0 53 24
apartheid 0 53 24
Israeli 0 53 24
regime 0 53 24
is 0 53 24
far 0 53 24
from 0 53 24
hating 0 53 24
Jews. 0 53 24

You 1 53 25
are 1 53 25
a 1 53 25
hateful 1 53 25
sad 1 53 25
man, 1 53 25
I 1 53 25
pray 1 53 25
to 1 53 25
Allah 1 53 25
you 1 53 25
get 1 53 25
the 1 53 25
help 1 53 25
you 1 53 25
need 1 53 25
and 1 53 25
find 1 53 25
happiness.” 1 53 25

There 1 53 26
is 1 53 26
much, 1 53 26
much 1 53 26
worse 1 53 26
about 1 53 26
Omar. 1 53 26

David 0 53 27
Steinberg 0 53 27
of 0 53 27
PJ 0 53 27
Media 0 53 27
has 0 53 27
done 0 53 27
extraordinary 1 53 27
work 1 53 27
in 0 53 27
shedding 0 53 27
light 0 53 27
on 0 53 27
aspects 0 53 27
of 0 53 27
Omar’s 0 53 27
record 0 53 27
that 0 53 27
the 0 53 27
establishment 0 53 27
media 0 53 27
has 0 53 27
steadfastly 1 53 27
ignored. 1 53 27

Steinberg 0 53 28
reports 0 53 28
that 0 53 28
Omar 0 53 28
has 0 53 28
“faced 0 53 28
allegations 0 53 28
-- 0 53 28
soon 0 53 28
backed 0 53 28
by 0 53 28
a 0 53 28
remarkable 0 53 28
amount 0 53 28
of 0 53 28
evidence 0 53 28
-- 0 53 28
that 0 53 28
she 0 53 28
had 0 53 28
married 0 53 28
her 0 53 28
own 0 53 28
brother 0 53 28
in 0 53 28
2009, 0 53 28
and 0 53 28
was 0 53 28
still 0 53 28
legally 0 53 28
his 0 53 28
wife. 0 53 28

They 0 53 29
officially 0 53 29
divorced 0 53 29
in 0 53 29
December 0 53 29
2017. 0 53 29

The 0 53 30
motivation 0 53 30
for 0 53 30
the 0 53 30
marriage 0 53 30
remains 0 53 30
unclear. 0 53 30

However, 0 53 31
the 0 53 31
totality 0 53 31
of 0 53 31
the 0 53 31
evidence 0 53 31
points 0 53 31
to 0 53 31
possible 0 53 31
immigration 0 53 31
fraud 0 53 31
and 0 53 31
student 0 53 31
loan 0 53 31
fraud.” 0 53 31
What’s 0 53 31
more, 0 53 31
she 0 53 31
swore 0 53 31
to 0 53 31
apparent 0 53 31
falsehoods 0 53 31
in 0 53 31
court. 0 53 31

But 0 53 32
Leftists 0 53 32
rarely 0 53 32
have 0 53 32
to 0 53 32
answer 0 53 32
for 0 53 32
their 0 53 32
corruption, 0 53 32
and 0 53 32
in 0 53 32
a 0 53 32
Democrat 0 53 32
House, 0 53 32
Omar 0 53 32
will 0 53 32
much 0 53 32
more 0 53 32
likely 0 53 32
be 0 53 32
celebrated 0 53 32
than 0 53 32
investigated. 0 53 32

She 0 53 33
and 0 53 33
Tlaib 0 53 33
will 0 53 33
enjoy 0 53 33
establishment 0 53 33
media 0 53 33
accolades 0 53 33
as 0 53 33
they 0 53 33
pursue 0 53 33
their 0 53 33
hard-Left, 0 53 33
anti-American, 0 53 33
anti-Israel 0 53 33
agenda. 0 53 33

Their 0 53 34
presence 0 53 34
in 0 53 34
the 0 53 34
House 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
Representatives 0 53 34
may 0 53 34
be 0 53 34
evidence 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
“diversity,” 0 53 34
but 0 53 34
it 0 53 34
is 0 53 34
also 0 53 34
a 0 53 34
disquieting 0 53 34
sign 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
the 0 53 34
continued 0 53 34
dominance 0 53 34
of 0 53 34
identity 0 53 34
politics, 0 53 34
and 0 53 34
the 1 53 34
increasing 1 53 34
balkanization 1 53 34
of 0 53 34
the 0 53 34
American 0 53 34
body 0 53 34
politic. 0 53 34

Forthrightly 1 53 35
pro-America, 1 53 35
pro-Israel 1 53 35
candidates 1 53 35
would 1 53 35
stand 1 53 35
little 1 53 35
to 1 53 35
no 1 53 35
chance 1 53 35
in 1 53 35
either 1 53 35
of 1 53 35
their 1 53 35
districts. 1 53 35

And 1 53 36
that 1 53 36
is 1 53 36
indicative 1 53 36
of 1 53 36
a 1 53 36
much 1 53 36
larger 1 53 36
problem. 1 53 36
