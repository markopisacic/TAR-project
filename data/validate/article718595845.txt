The 1
US 1
Is 1
Blatantly 1
Telling 1
Lies 1

It’s 0
no 0
secret 0
that 0
the 0
Trump 0
administration 0
has 0
a 0
strong 0
distaste 0
for 0
Iran. 0

Iran 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
the 0
only 0
issues 0
on 0
which 0
the 0
U.S. 0
president 0
has 0
remained 0
relatively 0
consistent. 0

Trump 0
berated 0
the 0
country 0
both 0
before 0
and 0
after 0
taking 0
office. 0

However, 0
Trump’s 0
anti-Iran 0
strategy 0
goes 1
against 1
the 1
better 1
judgment 1
of 0
even 0
the 0
most 0
anti-Iranian 1
advisors 1
in 1
his 1
staff 1
who 1
don’t 1
want 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
U.S. 1
isolated 1
on 1
the 1
world 1
stage. 1

Fortunately 0
for 0
Trump, 0
however, 0
he 0
is 0
not 0
alone 0
in 0
his 0
bid 0
to 0
isolate 0
and 0
demonize 0
Iran 0
at 0
all 0
costs. 0

On 0
December 0
12, 0
Trump’s 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
U.N., 0
Nikki 0
Haley, 0
gave 0
a 0
grandiose 0
speech 0
demonizing 0
Iran 0
that 0
echoed 0
Colin 0
Powell’s 0
infamous 0
performance 0
before 0
the 0
U.N. 0
in 0
2003. 0

Haley’s 0
essential 0
claim 0
was 0
that 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
is 0
under 0
attack 0
by 0
missiles 0
supplied 0
to 0
Yemen 0
by 0
the 0
Iranian 0
government 0
and 0
that 0
the 0
world 0
should 0
not 0
sit 0
idly 0
by 0
as 0
this 0
goes 0
on. 0

“If 1
we 1
do 1
nothing 1
about 1
the 1
missiles 1
fired 1
at 1
Saudi 1
Arabia, 1
we 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
stop 1
the 1
violence,” 1
Haley 0
warned. 0

“There 0
is 0
clear 0
evidence 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
that 0
landed 0
on 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
come 0
from 0
Iran,” 0
she 0
said. 0

“The 0
evidence 0
is 0
undeniable. 0

The 0
weapons 0
might 0
as 0
well 0
have 0
had 0
‘Made 1
in 1
Iran’ 1
stickers 1
all 1
over 1
it.” 1

However, 0
even 0
as 0
Haley 0
opened 0
her 0
mouth, 0
many 0
commentators 0
could 0
already 0
identify 0
a 0
number 0
of 0
issues 0
with 0
her 0
speech. 0

As 0
Common 0
Dream’s 0
Reza 0
Marashi 0
explained: 0

“Haley 0
cited 0
a 0
UN 0
report 0
in 0
her 0
claim 0
regarding 0
Iranian 0
missile 0
transfers 0
to 0
the 0
Houthis. 0

Of 0
course, 0
the 0
UN 0
has 0
reached 0
no 0
such 0
conclusion. 0

Instead, 0
a 0
panel 0
of 0
experts 0
concluded 0
that 0
fired 0
missile 0
fragments 0
show 0
components 0
from 0
an 0
Iranian 0
company, 0
but 0
they 0
have 0
‘no 0
evidence 0
as 0
to 0
the 0
identity 0
of 0
the 0
broker 0
or 0
supplier.’ 0
Asked 0
about 0
Haley’s 0
claim 0
that 0
Iran 0
is 0
the 0
culprit, 0
Sweden’s 0
ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
said, 0
‘The 0
info 0
I 0
have 0
is 0
less 0
clear.’ 0
Analysts 0
from 0
the 0
U.S. 0
Department 0
of 0
Defense 0
speaking 0
to 0
reporters 0
at 0
Haley’s 0
speech 0
openly 0
acknowledged 0
that 0
they 0
do 0
not 0
know 0
the 0
missiles’ 0
origin. 0

Perhaps 0
most 0
surreal 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
same 0
UN 0
report 0
cited 0
by 0
Haley 0
also 0
says 0
the 0
missile 0
included 0
a 0
component 0
that 0
was 0
manufactured 0
by 0
an 0
American 0
company. 0

Did 1
she 1
disingenuously 1
omit 1
that 1
inconvenient 1
bit 1
from 1
her 1
remarks, 1
or 1
fail 1
to 1
read 1
the 1
entire 1
UN 1
report? 1

The 0
world 0
may 0
never 0
know.” 0

Regardless 0
of 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
Haley 0
misrepresented 0
the 0
U.N. 0
report 0
in 0
question, 0
it 0
appears 0
the 0
entire 1
premise 1
of 1
the 1
U.N. 1
report 1
is 1
almost 1
completely 1
incorrect, 1
anyway, 0
according 0
to 0
former 0
inspector 0
Scott 0
Ritter. 0

Ritter 0
writes: 0

“The 0
missile 0
debris 0
in 0
question 0
actually 0
contradicts 0
the 0
finding 0
of 0
the 0
UN 0
panel, 0
which 0
held 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
launched 0
against 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
had 0
been 0
transferred 0
to 0
Yemen 0
in 0
pieces 0
and 0
assembled 0
there 0
by 0
Houthi 0
missile 0
engineers; 0
it 0
is 0
clear 0
that 0
the 0
missiles 0
in 0
question 0
had 0
been 0
in 0
the 0
possession 0
of 0
Yemen 0
well 0
before 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Arabian-led 0
intervention 0
of 0
2015, 0
and 0
that 0
their 0
source 0
was 0
either 0
Soviet 0
or 0
North 0
Korean. 0

The 0
modification 0
kits, 0
on 0
the 0
other 0
hand, 0
appear 0
to 0
be 0
of 0
Iranian 0
origin, 0
and 0
were 0
transported 0
to 0
Yemen 0
via 0
Oman. 0

The 0
UN 0
panel 0
claims 0
not 0
to 0
have 0
any 0
evidence 0
of 0
‘external 0
missile 0
specialists’ 0
working 0
alongside 0
the 0
Houthi; 0
indeed, 0
the 0
simplicity 0
of 0
the 0
Burkhan 0
2-H 0
modification 0
concept 0
is 0
such 0
that 0
anyone 0
already 0
familiar 0
with 0
the 0
SCUD-B 0
missile 0
system 0
would 0
be 0
able 0
to 0
implement 0
the 0
required 0
processes 0
without 0
outside 0
assistance.” 0
[emphasis 0
added] 0

So 0
where 0
did 0
the 0
missiles 0
come 0
from, 0
and 0
who 0
made 0
them? 0

According 0
to 0
Ritter: 0

“Rather 0
than 0
the 0
Iranian-manufactured 0
Qiam-1 0
missiles 0
Haley 0
and 0
the 0
Saudi 0
Arabian 0
government 0
claimed, 0
the 0
debris 0
presented 0
by 0
Haley 0
were 0
of 0
a 0
modified 0
Soviet-manufactured 0
SCUD-B 0
missile; 0
the 0
airframe 0
and 0
engine 0
are 0
original 0
Soviet-made 0
components, 0
and 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
smaller 0
parts 0
on 0
display 0
bear 0
Cyrillic 0
(i.e., 0
Russian) 0
markings. 0

The 0
transformation 0
to 0
the 0
Burkhan 0
2-H 0
design 0
required 0
the 0
Houthi 0
engineers 0
to 0
increase 0
the 0
size 0
of 0
the 0
fuel 0
and 0
oxidizer 0
tanks, 0
and 0
lengthen 0
the 0
airframe 0
accordingly. 0

This 0
is 0
done 0
by 0
cutting 0
the 0
airframe, 0
and 0
welding 0
in 0
place 0
the 0
appropriate 0
segments 0
(this 0
also 0
required 0
that 0
the 0
fuel 0
supply 0
pipe, 0
which 0
passes 0
through 0
the 0
oxidizer 0
tank, 0
be 0
similarly 0
lengthened.) 0

The 0
difference 0
in 0
quality 0
between 0
the 0
factory 0
welds 0
and 0
the 0
new 0
welds 0
is 0
readily 0
discernable. 0

The 0
increased 0
fuel 0
supply 0
permits 0
a 0
longer 0
engine 0
burn, 0
which 0
in 0
turn 0
increases 0
the 0
range 0
of 0
the 0
missile. 0

The 0
Burkhan 0
2-H 0
uses 0
a 0
smaller 0
warhead 0
than 0
the 0
SCUD 0
B; 0
as 0
such, 0
the 0
guidance 0
and 0
control 0
section 0
had 0
been 0
reconfigured 0
to 0
a 0
smaller 0
diameter, 0
and 0
an 0
inter-stage 0
section 0
added 0
to 0
connect 0
the 0
warhead/guidance 0
section 0
with 0
the 0
main 0
airframe.” 0

﻿ 0

Those 0
who 0
have 0
been 0
paying 0
attention 0
to 0
this 0
conflict 0
have 0
been 0
well 0
aware 0
that 0
the 0
U.S. 0
has 0
had 0
little 0
material 0
evidence 0
to 0
link 0
Yemen’s 0
Houthis 0
to 0
Iranian 0
arms 0
suppliers. 0

In 0
January 0
of 0
this 0
year, 0
a 0
panel 0
of 0
U.N. 0
experts 0
stated: 0

“The 0
panel 0
has 0
not 0
seen 0
sufficient 0
evidence 0
to 0
confirm 0
any 0
direct 0
large-scale 0
supply 0
of 0
arms 0
from 0
the 0
Government 0
of 0
the 0
Islamic 0
Republic 0
of 0
Iran, 0
although 0
there 0
are 0
indicators 0
that 0
anti-tank 0
guided 0
weapons 0
being 0
supplied 0
to 0
the 0
Houthi 0
or 0
Saleh 0
forces 0
are 0
of 0
Iranian 0
manufacture.” 0
[emphasis 0
added] 0

Even 0
if 0
Iran 0
were 0
arming 0
the 0
Houthis, 0
Haley’s 0
hypocritical 1
anti-Iran 0
rhetoric 0
doesn’t 0
excuse 0
the 0
U.S. 0
for 0
continuing 0
a 0
foreign 0
policy 0
that 0
essentially 0
armed 0
ISIS 0
through 0
U.S. 0
weapons 0
transfers, 0
or 0
for 0
arming 0
al-Qaeda’s 0
affiliate 0
in 0
Syria, 0
just 0
to 0
name 0
two 0
examples 0
of 0
Washington’s 0
schizophrenic 1
approach 1
to 0
the 0
region. 0

Why 1
is 1
the 1
U.S. 1
singling 1
out 1
Iran, 1
especially 1
when 1
the 1
Houthi 1
rebels 1
are 1
sworn 1
enemies 1
of 1
al-Qaeda? 1

The 0
issues 0
here 0
go 0
much 0
deeper 0
than 0
nonsensical 0
hypocrisy. 0

According 0
to 0
Ritter, 0
the 0
entire 0
debacle 0
has 0
shown 0
that 0
if 0
Saudi 0
Arabia 0
cannot 0
contain 0
the 0
Houthi’s 0
missile 0
capabilities, 0
it 0
cannot 0
possibly 0
hope 0
to 0
take 0
on 0
Iran, 0
which 0
possesses 0
a 0
significantly 0
more 0
advanced 0
military 0
than 0
the 0
Houthis 0
do 0
on 0
their 0
own. 0

Ritter 0
explains 0
further: 0

“If 0
a 0
relatively 0
unsophisticated 0
foe 0
such 0
as 0
the 0
Houthi, 0
using 0
Iranian-modified 0
Soviet 0
and 0
North 0
Korean 0
missiles 0
derived 0
from 0
40-year-old 0
technology, 0
can 0
evade 0
an 0
enemy 0
force 0
using 0
the 0
most 0
modern 0
combat 0
aircraft 0
backed 0
up 0
by 0
the 0
most 0
sophisticated 0
intelligence 0
gathering 0
systems 0
available, 0
and 0
successfully 0
launch 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
that 0
threaten 0
the 0
political 0
and 0
economic 0
infrastructure 0
of 0
the 0
targeted 0
state, 0
what 0
does 0
that 0
say 0
about 0
the 0
prospects 0
of 0
any 0
U.S.-led 0
coalition 0
taking 0
on 0
the 0
far 0
more 0
advanced 0
mobile 0
missile 0
threats 0
that 0
exist 0
in 0
North 0
Korea 0
and 0
Iran 0
today? 0

The 0
fact 0
of 0
the 0
matter 0
is 0
that 0
no 0
military 0
anywhere 0
has 0
shown 0
the 0
ability 0
to 0
successfully 0
interdict 0
in 0
any 0
meaningful 0
way 0
a 0
determined 0
opponent 0
armed 0
with 0
mobile 0
ballistic 0
missile 0
capability. 0

If 0
the 0
Saudi 0
experience 0
in 0
Yemen 0
is 0
to 0
teach 0
us 0
anything, 0
it 0
is 0
that 0
any 0
military 0
plan 0
designed 0
to 0
confront 0
nations 0
such 0
as 0
North 0
Korea, 0
Iran 0
and 0
Russia 0
that 0
are 0
armed 0
with 0
sophisticated 0
mobile 0
ballistic 0
missiles 0
had 0
better 0
count 0
on 0
those 0
capabilities 0
remaining 0
intact 0
throughout 0
any 0
anticipated 0
period 0
of 0
hostility. 0

No 1
amount 1
of 1
chest-thumping 1
and 1
empty 1
rhetoric 1
by 1
American 1
political 1
and/or 1
military 1
leaders 1
can 1
offset 1
this 1
harsh 1
reality. 1

This 1
is 1
the 1
critical 1
lesson 1
of 1
Yemen, 1
and 1
the 1
United 1
States 1
would 1
do 1
well 1
to 1
heed 1
it 1
before 1
it 1
tries 1
to 1
foment 1
a 1
crisis 1
based 1
upon 1
trumped-up 1
charges.” 1
