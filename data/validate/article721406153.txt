Apparently, 1
They 1
Think 1
We 1
are 1
Fools 1

As 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
continues 0
his 0
five-year-long 0
tirade 0
against 0
the 1
imaginary 1
Catholic 1
Pharisees 1
who 0
defend 0
the 0
Church’s 0
teaching 0
on 0
the 0
indissolubility 0
of 0
marriage 0
and 0
the 0
integrally 0
related 0
Eucharistic 0
discipline—he 0
is 0
still 0
at 0
it 0
as 0
of 0
yesterday 0
(January 0
9)—he 0
and 1
his 1
collaborators 1
are 1
busily 1
engineering 1
neo-Pharisaical 1
escape 1
hatches 1
from 1
the 1
negative 1
precepts 1
of 1
the 1
divine 1
and 1
natural 1
law 1
emanating 1
from 1
the 1
Sixth 1
Commandment. 1

Determined 0
to 0
quell 0
any 0
Catholic 0
opposition 0
to 0
his 0
moral 0
subversion, 0
Francis 0
has 0
slapped 0
the 0
label 0
Authentic 0
Magisterium® 0
on 0
his 0
outrageous 0
opinion 0
that 0
in 0
“complex 0
circumstances” 0
wherein 0
it 0
is 0
not 0
“feasible” 0
to 0
live 0
as 0
brother 0
and 0
sister, 0
two 0
people 0
who 0
are 0
not 0
married 0
can 0
be 0
admitted 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
without 0
ceasing 0
extra-marital 0
sexual 0
relations 0
so 0
long 0
as 0
they 0
engage 0
in 0
an 0
ill-defined 0
“process 0
of 0
discernment.” 0
As 0
Father 0
Brian 0
Harrison 0
has 0
so 0
trenchantly 0
observed, 0
this 0
means 0
that 0
people 0
embroiled 0
in 0
adultery 0
can 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
while 0
they 0
“discern” 0
that 0
they 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
receiving 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
because 0
they 0
are 0
embroiled 0
in 0
adultery. 0

Do 1
they 1
think 1
we 1
are 1
fools? 1

Then 0
there 0
is 0
the 0
endlessly 0
double-talking 0
Cardinal 0
Müller. 0

In 0
a 0
recent 0
interview 0
concerning 0
Rocco 0
Buttiglione’s 0
verbal 1
contortions 1
aimed 0
at 0
demonstrating 0
that 0
the 0
administration 0
of 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
to 0
public 0
adulterers 0
is 0
consistent 0
with 0
the 0
Church’s 0
bimillenial 0
prohibition 0
of 0
precisely 0
that, 0
Müller 0
proposed 0
this 0
preposterous 1
“solution” 1
to 0
a 0
“problem” 0
that 0
does 0
not 0
exist: 0

It 0
is 0
possible 0
that 0
the 0
penitent 0
may 0
be 0
convinced 0
in 0
conscience, 0
and 0
with 0
good 0
reasons, 0
of 0
the 0
invalidity 0
of 0
the 0
first 0
marriage 0
even 0
though 0
they 0
cannot 0
offer 0
canonical 0
proof. 0

In 0
this 0
case 0
the 0
marriage 0
valid 0
before 0
God 0
would 0
be 0
the 0
second 0
one 0
and 0
the 0
pastor 0
could 0
grant 0
the 0
sacrament, 0
certainly 0
with 0
the 0
appropriate 0
precautions 0
as 0
not 0
to 0
scandalize 0
the 0
community 0
of 0
the 0
faithful 0
and 0
not 0
to 0
weaken 0
the 0
conviction 0
of 0
marriage 0
indissolubility. 0

The 0
Cardinal 0
knows 0
this 0
is 0
moral 1
and 1
canonical 1
nonsense. 1

No 1
Catholic, 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
he 1
consults 1
a 1
priest, 1
can 1
declare 1
for 1
himself 1
that 1
his 1
marriage 1
in 1
the 1
Church 1
was 1
invalid, 1
especially 1
when—indeed 1
because—he 1
lacks 1
canonical 1
proof 1
of 1
invalidity. 1

Moreover, 0
absent 0
an 0
annulment 0
granted 0
by 0
the 0
competent 0
Church 0
tribunal, 0
a 0
purported 0
“second 0
marriage” 0
can 0
only 0
be 0
an 0
invalid 0
civil 0
ceremony 0
and 0
thus 0
a 0
thinly 0
disguised 0
form 0
of 0
continuous 0
public 0
adultery. 0

Cardinal 0
Burke, 0
whom 0
Francis 0
sacked 0
as 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Church’s 0
highest 0
tribunal 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
major 0
impediment 0
to 0
the 1
conspiracy 1
culminating 1
in 1
Amoris 1
Laetitia 1
(AL), 0
has 0
observed 0
the 0
obvious 0
in 0
this 0
regard: 0

Such 0
cases 0
do 0
not 0
exist. 0

No 0
priest 0
has 0
the 0
authority 0
to 0
declare 0
a 0
marriage 0
null 0
in 0
the 0
internal 0
forum. 0

Marriage 0
is 0
a 0
public 0
state 0
in 0
the 0
Church, 0
and 0
the 0
judgment 0
regarding 0
an 0
accusation 0
of 0
nullity 0
of 0
marriage 0
must 0
be 0
made 0
in 0
accord 0
with 0
the 0
long 0
practice 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

If 1
a 1
college 1
of 1
judges 1
in 1
a 1
matrimonial 1
tribunal 1
is 1
not 1
able 1
to 1
arrive 1
at 1
moral 1
certitude 1
regarding 1
the 1
nullity 1
of 1
a 1
marriage 1
after 1
a 1
careful 1
and 1
thorough 1
examination 1
of 1
the 1
petition 1
of 1
nullity, 1
how 1
can 1
an 1
individual 1
priest 1
be 1
capable 1
of 1
making 1
such 1
a 1
judgment 1
having 1
to 1
do 1
with 1
the 1
eternal 1
salvation 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
in 1
question? 1

The 0
only 0
case 0
in 0
which 0
a 0
priest 0
could 0
admit 0
a 0
person 0
living 0
in 0
an 0
irregular 0
matrimonial 0
union 0
to 0
receive 0
the 0
Sacraments 0
of 0
Penance 0
and 0
Holy 0
Eucharist 0
is 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
who 0
agree 0
to 0
live 0
“as 0
brother 0
and 0
sister”, 0
that 0
is 0
to 0
respect 0
the 0
marriage 0
to 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
bound 0
by 0
not 0
living 0
in 0
a 0
marital 0
way 0
with 0
another 0
person. 0

Even 0
then, 0
the 0
priest 0
would 0
have 0
to 0
insist 0
that 0
the 0
couple 0
living 0
in 0
continence 0
receive 0
the 0
Sacraments 0
in 0
a 0
place 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
not 0
well 0
known, 0
lest 0
other 0
faithful 0
be 0
led 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
persons 0
living 0
in 0
an 0
irregular 0
matrimonial 0
union 0
may 0
receive 0
the 0
Sacraments. 0

Does 0
Cardinal 0
Müller 0
think 0
we 0
are 0
fools? 0

Some 0
of 0
us 0
apparently 0
are, 0
or 0
at 0
least 0
are 0
willing 0
to 0
serve 0
as 0
knowing 0
dupes 0
by 0
defending 0
neo-Pharisaical 0
sophistry 0
that 0
would 0
produce 0
“a 0
discipline 0
alien 0
to 0
the 0
entire 0
Tradition 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
and 0
Apostolic 0
faith.” 0

Apparently, 0
they 0
think 0
they 0
can 0
fool 1
us 0
in 0
the 0
next 0
phase 0
of 0
the 0
program 0
of 0
moral 0
subversion 0
that 0
this 0
incredible 0
Pope 0
seriously 0
expects 0
us 0
to 0
believe 0
is 0
an 0
imperative 0
of 0
“mercy”: 0
the 0
justification 0
of 0
contraception 0
in 0
“complex 0
cases” 0
to 0
which 0
“discernment” 0
must 0
be 0
applied. 0

Consider 0
the 0
recent 0
declaration 0
by 0
one 0
of 0
Francis’s 0
new 0
appointments 0
to 0
the 0
Pontifical 0
Academy 0
for 0
Life, 0
whose 0
entire 0
membership 0
he 0
sacked 0
and 0
whose 0
constitution 0
he 0
ordered 0
rewritten 0
to 0
neutralize 0
it. 0

In 0
a 0
lecture 0
at 0
the 0
Gregorian, 0
one 0
Father 0
Maurizio 0
Chiodi, 0
a 0
“moral 0
theologian” 0
of 0
the 0
post-Vatican 0
II 0
variety, 0
proposed 0
that 0
“an 0
artificial 0
method 0
for 0
the 0
regulation 0
of 0
births 0
could 0
be 0
recognized 0
as 0
anact 0
of 0
responsibilitythat 0
is 0
carried 0
out, 0
not 0
in 0
order 0
to 0
radically 0
reject 0
the 0
gift 0
of 0
a 0
child, 0
but 0
because 0
in 0
those 0
situationsresponsibility 0
calls 0
the 0
couple 0
and 0
the 0
family 0
to 0
other 0
forms 0
of 0
welcome 0
and 0
hospitality.” 0

That 0
is, 0
Francis’s 0
man 0
at 0
the 0
reconstituted 0
Pontifical 0
Academy 0
declares 0
openly 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
a 0
duty 0
to 0
contracept! 0

Chiodi’s 0
sole 0
“authority” 0
for 0
this 0
lie 1
from 1
the 1
pit 1
of 1
hell 1
is 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
Chapter 0
8 0
of 0
AL, 0
the 0
only 0
document 0
of 0
its 0
kind 0
in 0
the 0
entire 0
history 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

AL 0
will 0
doubtless 0
be 0
providing 0
cover 0
for 0
a 0
whole 0
new 0
line 0
of 0
Authentic 0
Magisterium® 0
products, 0
all 1
of 1
which 1
will 1
be 1
utter 1
fakes, 1
including 1
some 1
form 1
of 1
“pastoral 1
integration” 1
of 1
homosexual 1
unions. 1

Evidently, 0
they 0
do 0
think 0
we 0
are 0
fools 1
or 0
willing 0
to 0
play 0
the 0
fool 1
in 0
exchange 0
for 0
the 0
benefits 0
of 0
respectable 0
conformity 0
in 0
the 0
midst 0
of 0
an 0
unparalleled 0
debacle 0
for 0
the 0
Church. 0

(Consider 0
the 0
example 0
of 0
Catholic 0
Answers, 0
which 0
“defends 0
the 0
Faith” 0
while 0
refusing 0
to 0
recognize 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
under 0
ferocious 0
attack 0
from 0
the 0
very 0
vertices 0
of 0
the 0
Church. 0

Silence 1
at 1
best 1
is 1
the 1
price 1
it 1
must 1
pay 1
for 1
remaining 1
in 1
good 1
standing 1
with 1
the 1
pro-homosexual 1
bishop 1
Francis 1
has 1
installed 1
in 1
San 1
Diego.) 1

But 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
fools. 1

And 1
God 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
mocked. 1

Francis 1
and 1
all 1
his 1
designs 1
will 1
ultimately 1
come 1
to 1
nothing. 1

Meanwhile, 0
ours 0
is 0
but 0
to 0
keep 0
the 0
Faith 0
and 0
protest 0
before 0
God 0
and 0
man 0
the 0
blows 0
now 0
raining 0
down 0
against 0
the 0
Church, 0
even 0
when 0
they 0
come 0
from 0
a 0
wayward 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
at 0
her 0
summit. 0

Indeed, 0
especially 0
then. 0
