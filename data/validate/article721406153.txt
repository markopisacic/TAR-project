the 0 134 2
label 0 134 2

on 0 134 2

opinion 0 134 2
that 0 134 2

as 0 134 2

be 0 134 2
admitted 0 134 2

without 0 134 2
ceasing 0 134 2
extra-marital 0 134 2
sexual 0 134 2
relations 0 134 2
so 0 134 2
long 0 134 2
as 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
engage 0 134 2
in 0 134 2
an 0 134 2
ill-defined 0 134 2
“process 0 134 2
of 0 134 2
discernment.” 0 134 2
As 0 134 2
Father 0 134 2
Brian 0 134 2
Harrison 0 134 2
has 0 134 2
so 0 134 2
trenchantly 0 134 2
observed, 0 134 2
this 0 134 2
means 0 134 2
that 0 134 2
people 0 134 2
embroiled 0 134 2
in 0 134 2
adultery 0 134 2
can 0 134 2
receive 0 134 2
Holy 0 134 2
Communion 0 134 2
while 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
“discern” 0 134 2
that 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
should 0 134 2
not 0 134 2
be 0 134 2
receiving 0 134 2
Holy 0 134 2
Communion 0 134 2
because 0 134 2
they 0 134 2
are 0 134 2
embroiled 0 134 2
in 0 134 2
adultery. 0 134 2

Do 1 134 3
they 1 134 3
think 1 134 3
we 1 134 3
are 1 134 3
fools? 1 134 3

Then 0 134 4
there 0 134 4
is 0 134 4
the 0 134 4
endlessly 0 134 4
double-talking 0 134 4
Cardinal 0 134 4
Müller. 0 134 4

In 0 134 5
a 0 134 5
recent 0 134 5
interview 0 134 5
concerning 0 134 5
Rocco 0 134 5
Buttiglione’s 0 134 5
verbal 1 134 5
contortions 1 134 5
aimed 0 134 5
at 0 134 5
demonstrating 0 134 5
that 0 134 5
the 0 134 5
administration 0 134 5
of 0 134 5
Holy 0 134 5
Communion 0 134 5
to 0 134 5
public 0 134 5
adulterers 0 134 5
is 0 134 5
consistent 0 134 5
with 0 134 5
the 0 134 5
Church’s 0 134 5
bimillenial 0 134 5
prohibition 0 134 5
of 0 134 5
precisely 0 134 5
that, 0 134 5
Müller 0 134 5
proposed 0 134 5
this 0 134 5
preposterous 1 134 5
“solution” 1 134 5
to 0 134 5
a 0 134 5
“problem” 0 134 5
that 0 134 5
does 0 134 5
not 0 134 5
exist: 0 134 5

It 0 134 6
is 0 134 6
possible 0 134 6
that 0 134 6
the 0 134 6
penitent 0 134 6
may 0 134 6
be 0 134 6
convinced 0 134 6
in 0 134 6
conscience, 0 134 6
and 0 134 6
with 0 134 6
good 0 134 6
reasons, 0 134 6
of 0 134 6
the 0 134 6
invalidity 0 134 6
of 0 134 6
the 0 134 6
first 0 134 6
marriage 0 134 6
even 0 134 6
though 0 134 6
they 0 134 6
cannot 0 134 6
offer 0 134 6
canonical 0 134 6
proof. 0 134 6

In 0 134 7
this 0 134 7
case 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
marriage 0 134 7
valid 0 134 7
before 0 134 7
God 0 134 7
would 0 134 7
be 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
second 0 134 7
one 0 134 7
and 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
pastor 0 134 7
could 0 134 7
grant 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
sacrament, 0 134 7
certainly 0 134 7
with 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
appropriate 0 134 7
precautions 0 134 7
as 0 134 7
not 0 134 7
to 0 134 7
scandalize 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
community 0 134 7
of 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
faithful 0 134 7
and 0 134 7
not 0 134 7
to 0 134 7
weaken 0 134 7
the 0 134 7
conviction 0 134 7
of 0 134 7
marriage 0 134 7
indissolubility. 0 134 7

The 0 134 8
Cardinal 0 134 8
knows 0 134 8
this 0 134 8
is 0 134 8
moral 1 134 8
and 1 134 8
canonical 1 134 8
nonsense. 1 134 8

No 1 134 9
Catholic, 1 134 9
whether 1 134 9
or 1 134 9
not 1 134 9
he 1 134 9
consults 1 134 9
a 1 134 9
priest, 1 134 9
can 1 134 9
declare 1 134 9
for 1 134 9
himself 1 134 9
that 1 134 9
his 1 134 9
marriage 1 134 9
in 1 134 9
the 1 134 9
Church 1 134 9
was 1 134 9
invalid, 1 134 9
especially 1 134 9
when—indeed 1 134 9
because—he 1 134 9
lacks 1 134 9
canonical 1 134 9
proof 1 134 9
of 1 134 9
invalidity. 1 134 9

Moreover, 0 134 10
absent 0 134 10
an 0 134 10
annulment 0 134 10
granted 0 134 10
by 0 134 10
the 0 134 10
competent 0 134 10

tribunal, 0 134 10
a 0 134 10
purported 0 134 10
“second 0 134 10
marriage” 0 134 10
can 0 134 10
only 0 134 10
be 0 134 10
an 0 134 10
invalid 0 134 10
civil 0 134 10
ceremony 0 134 10
and 0 134 10
thus 0 134 10
a 0 134 10
thinly 0 134 10
disguised 0 134 10
form 0 134 10
of 0 134 10
continuous 0 134 10
public 0 134 10
adultery. 0 134 10

of 0 134 11
the 0 134 11
Church’s 0 134 11

The 0 134 16
only 0 134 16
case 0 134 16
in 0 134 16
which 0 134 16
a 0 134 16

could 0 134 16
admit 0 134 16
a 0 134 16
person 0 134 16
living 0 134 16
in 0 134 16

of 0 134 16
Penance 0 134 16
and 0 134 16
Holy 0 134 16
Eucharist 0 134 16

the 0 134 16

of 0 134 16
a 0 134 16
couple 0 134 16

“as 0 134 16

that 0 134 16
is 0 134 16

respect 0 134 16
the 0 134 16

Even 0 134 17
then, 0 134 17
the 0 134 17

Does 0 134 18
Cardinal 0 134 18
Müller 0 134 18
think 0 134 18
we 0 134 18
are 0 134 18
fools? 0 134 18

Some 0 134 19
of 0 134 19
us 0 134 19
apparently 0 134 19
are, 0 134 19
or 0 134 19
at 0 134 19
least 0 134 19
are 0 134 19
willing 0 134 19
to 0 134 19

defending 0 134 19
neo-Pharisaical 0 134 19
sophistry 0 134 19
that 0 134 19
would 0 134 19
produce 0 134 19
“a 0 134 19

an 0 134 20

But 1 134 29
we 1 134 29
are 1 134 29
not 1 134 29

And 1 134 30
God 1 134 30

all 1 134 31
