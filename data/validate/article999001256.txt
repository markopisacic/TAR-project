However, 0 173 2
in 0 173 2
the 0 173 2
same 0 173 2
breath 0 173 2
that 0 173 2
she 0 173 2
ended 0 173 2
the 0 173 2
challenges, 0 173 2
she 0 173 2
also 0 173 2

me, 1 173 3
all 1 173 3
she's 1 173 3

her 0 173 19
run 0 173 19
for 0 173 19
Georgia 0 173 19
governor 0 173 19
on 0 173 19
Friday, 0 173 19
but 0 173 19
the 0 173 19
Democrat 0 173 19
said 0 173 19
she 0 173 19
would 0 173 19
not 0 173 19
concede 0 173 19
the 0 173 19

to 0 173 19
Republican 0 173 19

As 0 173 20
state 0 173 20
officials 0 173 20
prepare 0 173 20
to 0 173 20
certify 0 173 20
the 0 173 20
vote, 0 173 20
Abrams 0 173 20
acknowledged 0 173 20
the 0 173 20
law 0 173 20
“allows 0 173 20
no 0 173 20
further 0 173 20
viable 0 173 20
remedy” 0 173 20
to 0 173 20

her 0 173 20
quest 0 173 20
to 0 173 20
be 0 173 20
the 0 173 20
nation’s 0 173 20
first 0 173 20
black 0 173 20
female 0 173 20
governor. 0 173 20

But 0 173 21
she 0 173 21
laced 0 173 21
her 0 173 21
speech 0 173 21
with 0 173 21
biting 0 173 21
criticism 0 173 21
of 0 173 21
Kemp, 0 173 21
who 0 173 21
she 0 173 21
accused 0 173 21
of 0 173 21
leveraging 0 173 21
his 0 173 21
role 0 173 21
as 0 173 21
the 0 173 21
state’s 0 173 21
top 0 173 21
elections 0 173 21
official 0 173 21
to 0 173 21
suppress 0 173 21
voters. 0 173 21

“I 0 173 22
will 0 173 22
not 0 173 22
concede,” 0 173 22
she 0 173 22
added, 0 173 22
“because 0 173 22
the 0 173 22
erosion 0 173 22
of 0 173 22
our 0 173 22
democracy 0 173 22
is 0 173 22
not 0 173 22
right.” 0 173 22

You 1 173 23
mean 1 173 23
like 1 173 23
having 1 173 23
a 1 173 23
sister 1 173 23
waiting 1 173 23
in 1 173 23
the 1 173 23
wings 1 173 23
of 1 173 23
any 1 173 23
campaign 1 173 23
lawsuits, 1 173 23
Ms. 1 173 23
Abrams? 1 173 23

What 1 173 24
about 1 173 24
invalid 1 173 24
provisional 1 173 24
ballots 1 173 24
getting 1 173 24
mixed 1 173 24
in 1 173 24
with 1 173 24
valid 1 173 24
ones? 1 173 24

Maybe 1 173 25
a 1 173 25
little 1 173 25
electronic 1 173 25
voter 1 173 25
manipulation, 1 173 25
Ms. 1 173 25
Abrams? 1 173 25

How 1 173 26
about 1 173 26
non-citizens 1 173 26
and 1 173 26
illegal 1 173 26
aliens 1 173 26
voting, 1 173 26
Ms. 1 173 26
Abrams? 1 173 26

Are 0 173 27
these 0 173 27
evidence 0 173 27
of 0 173 27
the 0 173 27
erosion 0 173 27
of 0 173 27
the 0 173 27
democratic 0 173 27
process? 0 173 27

Sure 0 173 28
they 0 173 28
are 0 173 28
and 0 173 28
they 0 173 28
appear 0 173 28
to 0 173 28
all 0 173 28
be 0 173 28
coming 0 173 28
from 0 173 28
the 0 173 28
party 0 173 28
that 0 173 28
Stacey 0 173 28
Abrams 0 173 28
represents, 0 173 28
but 0 173 28
she's 0 173 28
not 0 173 28
going 0 173 28
to 0 173 28
talk 0 173 28
about 0 173 28
that. 0 173 28

But 0 173 29
she 0 173 29
wasn't 0 173 29
going 0 173 29
to 0 173 29
concede. 0 173 29

Nope, 0 173 30
that 0 173 30
arrogant 0 173 30
wanna-be 0 173 30
first 0 173 30
female 0 173 30
governor 0 173 30
of 0 173 30
Georgia 0 173 30
simply 0 173 30
would 0 173 30
not 0 173 30
bow 0 173 30
out 0 173 30
gracefully. 0 173 30

“To 0 173 31
watch 0 173 31
an 0 173 31
elected 0 173 31
official 0 173 31
who 0 173 31
claims 0 173 31
to 0 173 31
represent 0 173 31
the 0 173 31
people 0 173 31
in 0 173 31
this 0 173 31
state 0 173 31
baldly 1 173 31
pin 1 173 31
his 1 173 31
hopes 1 173 31
for 0 173 31
election 0 173 31
on 0 173 31
the 0 173 31
suppression 0 173 31
of 0 173 31
the 0 173 31
people’s 0 173 31
democratic 0 173 31
right 0 173 31
to 0 173 31
vote 0 173 31
has 0 173 31
been 0 173 31
truly 0 173 31
appalling,” 0 173 31
Abrams 0 173 31
said. 0 173 31

“So, 0 173 32
let’s 0 173 32
be 0 173 32
clear," 0 173 32
she 0 173 32
continued. 0 173 32

"This 0 173 33
is 0 173 33
not 0 173 33
a 0 173 33
speech 0 173 33
of 0 173 33
concession. 0 173 33

Because 0 173 34
concession 0 173 34
means 0 173 34
to 0 173 34
acknowledge 0 173 34
an 0 173 34
action 0 173 34
is 0 173 34
right, 0 173 34
true 0 173 34
or 0 173 34
proper. 0 173 34

As 0 173 35
a 0 173 35
woman 0 173 35
of 0 173 35
conscience 0 173 35
and 0 173 35
faith, 0 173 35
I 0 173 35
cannot 0 173 35
concede 0 173 35
that. 0 173 35

But 0 173 36
my 0 173 36
assessment 0 173 36
is 0 173 36
the 0 173 36
law 0 173 36
currently 0 173 36
allows 0 173 36
no 0 173 36
further 0 173 36
viable 0 173 36
remedy.” 0 173 36

No, 0 173 37
concession 0 173 37
means 0 173 37
"a 0 173 37
thing 0 173 37
that 0 173 37
is 0 173 37
granted, 0 173 37
especially 0 173 37
in 0 173 37
response 0 173 37
to 0 173 37
demands; 0 173 37
a 0 173 37
thing 0 173 37
conceded." 0 173 37

Abrams 0 173 38
was 0 173 38
easily 0 173 38
defeated 0 173 38
in 0 173 38
terms 0 173 38
of 0 173 38
votes. 0 173 38

She 0 173 39
was 0 173 39
the 0 173 39
one 0 173 39
trying 0 173 39
to 0 173 39
"find" 0 173 39
and 0 173 39
count 0 173 39
votes 0 173 39
remember? 0 173 39

She 0 173 40
is 0 173 40
the 0 173 40
one 0 173 40
claiming 0 173 40
there 0 173 40
was 0 173 40
cancellation 0 173 40
of 0 173 40
hundreds 0 173 40
of 0 173 40
thousands 0 173 40
of 0 173 40
voter 0 173 40
registrations. 0 173 40

Where 0 173 41
is 0 173 41
her 0 173 41
evidence? 0 173 41

She 0 173 42
has 0 173 42
none. 0 173 42

Stacey 0 173 43
Abrams 0 173 43
is 0 173 43
a 0 173 43
sore 0 173 43
loser 0 173 43
just 0 173 43
like 0 173 43
Hillary 0 173 43
Clinton 0 173 43
and 0 173 43
this 0 173 43
little 0 173 43
temper 0 173 43
tantrum 0 173 43
she 0 173 43
put 0 173 43
on 0 173 43
display 0 173 43
will 0 173 43
probably 0 173 43
sink 1 173 43
any 1 173 43
chances 1 173 43
she 0 173 43
may 0 173 43
have 0 173 43
had 0 173 43
in 0 173 43
the 0 173 43
future 0 173 43
to 0 173 43
run 0 173 43
again. 0 173 43

Good! 1 173 44

Thank 1 173 45
God, 1 173 45
Georgia 1 173 45
didn't 1 173 45

this 1 173 45
