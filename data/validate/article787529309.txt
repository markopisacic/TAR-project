yet. 0 349 1

They 0 349 2
have 0 349 2
resorted 0 349 2
to 0 349 2
peddling 0 349 2
an 0 349 2
allegation 0 349 2
of 0 349 2
sexual 0 349 2
misconduct 0 349 2
against 0 349 2
Judge 0 349 2
Kavanaugh 0 349 2
that 0 349 2
supposedly 0 349 2
occurred 0 349 2
while 0 349 2
the 0 349 2
judge 0 349 2
was 0 349 2
in 0 349 2
high 0 349 2
school. 0 349 2

The 0 349 3
accuser 0 349 3
had 0 349 3
refused 0 349 3

She 0 349 4
conveniently 0 349 4
waited 0 349 4
until 0 349 4
this 0 349 4
Sunday 0 349 4
to 0 349 4

The 0 349 5
accuser’s 0 349 5

is 0 349 5
Christine 0 349 5

Judge 0 349 6
Kavanaugh 0 349 6
issued 0 349 6
a 0 349 6
statement 0 349 6
on 0 349 6
Friday 0 349 6
in 0 349 6
which 0 349 6
he 0 349 6
said, 0 349 6
"I 0 349 6
categorically 1 349 6

unequivocally 1 349 6
deny 1 349 6
this 0 349 6
allegation. 0 349 6

I 0 349 7
did 0 349 7
not 0 349 7
do 0 349 7
this 0 349 7
back 0 349 7
in 0 349 7
high 0 349 7
school 0 349 7
or 0 349 7
at 0 349 7
any 0 349 7
time." 0 349 7

Senator 0 349 8
Dianne 0 349 8
Feinstein 0 349 8
(D-Calif.), 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
ranking 0 349 8
Democrat 0 349 8
on 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
Senate 0 349 8
Judiciary 0 349 8
Committee 0 349 8
that 0 349 8
heard 0 349 8
Judge 0 349 8
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 8
public 0 349 8
testimony 0 349 8
earlier 0 349 8
this 0 349 8
month 0 349 8
during 0 349 8
his 0 349 8
Supreme 0 349 8
Court 0 349 8
confirmation 0 349 8
hearing, 0 349 8
had 0 349 8
received 0 349 8
last 0 349 8
July 0 349 8
a 0 349 8
copy 0 349 8
of 0 349 8
a 0 349 8
letter 0 349 8
written 0 349 8
by 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
woman 0 349 8
making 0 349 8
the 0 349 8
charge, 0 349 8
who 0 349 8
we 0 349 8
now 0 349 8
know 0 349 8
was 0 349 8
Ms. 0 349 8
Ford. 0 349 8

Even 0 349 9
though 0 349 9
Senator 0 349 9
Feinstein 0 349 9
had 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
letter 0 349 9
in 0 349 9
hand, 0 349 9
she 0 349 9
never 0 349 9
brought 0 349 9
up 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
charge 0 349 9
during 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
public 0 349 9
hearing, 0 349 9
nor 0 349 9
during 0 349 9
her 0 349 9
own 0 349 9
meeting 0 349 9
with 0 349 9
the 0 349 9
judge. 0 349 9

Instead, 0 349 10
Senator 0 349 10
Feinstein 0 349 10
sat 0 349 10
on 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
letter 0 349 10
until 0 349 10
late 0 349 10
last 0 349 10
week, 0 349 10
when 0 349 10
she 0 349 10
issued 0 349 10
a 0 349 10
cryptic 0 349 10
release 0 349 10
stating 0 349 10
that 0 349 10
she 0 349 10
had 0 349 10
received 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
letter 0 349 10
but 0 349 10
did 0 349 10
not 0 349 10
want 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
give 0 349 10
more 0 349 10
details 0 349 10
in 0 349 10
deference 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
woman’s 0 349 10
wish 0 349 10
to 0 349 10
keep 0 349 10
the 0 349 10
matter 0 349 10
confidential. 0 349 10

Senator 0 349 11
Feinstein 0 349 11
turned 0 349 11
the 0 349 11
letter 0 349 11
over 0 349 11
to 0 349 11
the 0 349 11
FBI. 0 349 11

The 0 349 12
FBI 0 349 12
placed 0 349 12
the 0 349 12
letter 0 349 12
in 0 349 12
its 0 349 12
background 0 349 12
file 0 349 12
on 0 349 12
Judge 0 349 12
Kavanaugh 0 349 12
but 0 349 12
decided 0 349 12
not 0 349 12
to 0 349 12
pursue 0 349 12
any 0 349 12
further 0 349 12
investigation. 0 349 12

Senator 0 349 13
Feinstein 0 349 13
had 0 349 13
initially 0 349 13
resisted 0 349 13
sharing 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
contents 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
letter 0 349 13
with 0 349 13
her 0 349 13
fellow 0 349 13
Democrat 0 349 13
members 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
Senate 0 349 13
Judiciary 0 349 13
Committee 0 349 13
or 0 349 13
to 0 349 13
go 0 349 13
public 0 349 13
with 0 349 13
its 0 349 13
existence 0 349 13
because 0 349 13
“the 0 349 13
incident 0 349 13
was 0 349 13
too 0 349 13
distant 0 349 13
in 0 349 13
the 0 349 13
past 0 349 13
to 0 349 13
merit 0 349 13
public 0 349 13
discussion” 0 349 13
and 0 349 13
she 0 349 13
had 0 349 13
already 0 349 13
“taken 0 349 13
care 0 349 13
of 0 349 13
it,” 0 349 13
according 0 349 13
to 0 349 13

quoted 0 349 13
by 0 349 13
The 0 349 13
New 0 349 13

Nevertheless, 0 349 14
Senator 0 349 14
Feinstein 0 349 14
evidently 0 349 14
bowed 0 349 14
to 0 349 14
pressure 0 349 14
from 0 349 14
her 0 349 14
leftist 1 349 14
colleagues 1 349 14
to 0 349 14
find 0 349 14
a 0 349 14
way 0 349 14
to 0 349 14

what 0 349 16
she 0 349 16
called 0 349 16
her 0 349 16
“civic 0 349 16

to 0 349 19
the 0 349 19
Washington 0 349 19

While 0 349 20
his 0 349 20
friend 0 349 20
watched, 0 349 20
she 0 349 20
said, 0 349 20
Kavanaugh 0 349 20
pinned 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
to 0 349 20
a 0 349 20
bed 0 349 20
on 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
back 0 349 20
and 0 349 20
groped 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
over 0 349 20
her 0 349 20
clothes, 0 349 20
grinding 0 349 20
his 0 349 20

against 0 349 20

tried 0 349 21
to 0 349 21

she 0 349 21

Ms. 0 349 23

Here 0 349 24
is 0 349 24
where 0 349 24
Ms. 0 349 24
Ford’s 0 349 24

becomes 0 349 24
quite 0 349 24
murky 0 349 24
and 0 349 24
begins 0 349 24
to 0 349 24

apart. 0 349 24

Although 0 349 25
Ms. 0 349 25
Ford 0 349 25
believes 0 349 25
the 0 349 25
alleged 0 349 25

not 0 349 26
remember 0 349 26
how 0 349 26
the 0 349 26
gathering 0 349 26
came 0 349 26
together 0 349 26
the 0 349 26
night 0 349 26
of 0 349 26
the 0 349 26
incident.” 0 349 26
She 0 349 26
also 0 349 26
does 0 349 26
not 0 349 26
remember 0 349 26
how 0 349 26
she 0 349 26
got 0 349 26
home. 0 349 26

Yet 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
claims 0 349 27
to 0 349 27
be 0 349 27
absolutely 0 349 27
certain 0 349 27
that 0 349 27
Kavanaugh, 0 349 27
whom 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
presumably 0 349 27
knew 0 349 27
only 0 349 27
as 0 349 27
an 0 349 27
acquaintance 0 349 27
and 0 349 27
said 0 349 27
she 0 349 27
had 0 349 27
not 0 349 27
spoken 0 349 27
to 0 349 27
since 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
night 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
incident 0 349 27
allegedly 0 349 27
occurred, 0 349 27
was 0 349 27
involved 0 349 27
in 0 349 27
the 0 349 27
alleged 0 349 27
incident. 0 349 27

Ms. 0 349 28
Ford 0 349 28
admitted 0 349 28
that 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
“told 0 349 28
no 0 349 28
one 0 349 28
at 0 349 28
the 0 349 28
time 0 349 28
what 0 349 28
had 0 349 28
happened 0 349 28
to 0 349 28
her.” 0 349 28
In 0 349 28
fact, 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
said 0 349 28
she 0 349 28
recalled 0 349 28
thinking: 0 349 28
“I’m 0 349 28
not 0 349 28
ever 0 349 28
telling 0 349 28
anyone 0 349 28
this. 0 349 28

This 0 349 29
is 0 349 29
nothing, 0 349 29
it 0 349 29
didn’t 0 349 29
happen, 0 349 29
and 0 349 29
he 0 349 29
didn’t 0 349 29
rape 0 349 29
me.” 0 349 29
Even 0 349 29
if 0 349 29
one 0 349 29
explains 0 349 29
this 0 349 29
behavior 0 349 29
as 0 349 29
the 0 349 29
natural 0 349 29
reaction 0 349 29
of 0 349 29
a 0 349 29
frightened 0 349 29
teenager 0 349 29
to 0 349 29
a 0 349 29
highly 0 349 29
traumatic 0 349 29
incident, 0 349 29
that 0 349 29
does 0 349 29
not 0 349 29
explain 0 349 29
why, 0 349 29
by 0 349 29
her 0 349 29
own 0 349 29
admission, 0 349 29
she 0 349 29
“told 0 349 29
no 0 349 29
one 0 349 29
of 0 349 29
the 0 349 29

Most 0 349 30
revealingly, 0 349 30
the 0 349 30
article 0 349 30
reported 0 349 30
on 0 349 30
a 0 349 30
gaping 1 349 30

The 0 349 31

not 0 349 31

say 0 349 31
she 0 349 31
reported 0 349 31
that 0 349 31

not 0 349 32
mention 0 349 32
Judge 0 349 32
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 32
name. 0 349 32

Judge 0 349 33
Kavanaugh 0 349 33
has 0 349 33
had 0 349 33
extensive 0 349 33
background 0 349 33
checks 0 349 33
performed 0 349 33
on 0 349 33
him 0 349 33
in 0 349 33
the 0 349 33
past 0 349 33
for 0 349 33
his 0 349 33
various 0 349 33
federal 0 349 33
government 0 349 33
positions, 0 349 33

Ms. 1 349 34
Ford 1 349 34
may 1 349 34
believe 1 349 34
her 1 349 34
story 1 349 34
to 1 349 34
be 1 349 34
true, 1 349 34
but 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
lack 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
any 1 349 34
credible 1 349 34
corroborating 1 349 34
evidence, 1 349 34

of 1 349 34
details 1 349 34
surrounding 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
alleged 1 349 34

the 1 349 34
absence 1 349 34

pattern 1 349 34
of 1 349 34

sexual 1 349 34
misconduct 1 349 34
by 1 349 34
Judge 1 349 34
Kavanaugh 1 349 34
undercut 1 349 34
the 1 349 34
reliability 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
her 1 349 34
version 1 349 34
of 1 349 34
the 1 349 34

vouched 0 349 35
for 0 349 35
his 0 349 35
character: 0 349 35

We 0 349 36
are 0 349 36
women 0 349 36
who 0 349 36
have 0 349 36
known 0 349 36
Brett 0 349 36

for 0 349 36
more 0 349 36
than 0 349 36
35 0 349 36
years 0 349 36
and 0 349 36
knew 0 349 36
him 0 349 36
while 0 349 36
he 0 349 36
attended 0 349 36

between 0 349 36
1979 0 349 36

For 1 349 37
the 1 349 37
entire 1 349 37
time 1 349 37
we 1 349 37
have 1 349 37
known 1 349 37
Brett 1 349 37
Kavanaugh, 1 349 37
he 1 349 37
has 1 349 37
behaved 1 349 37
honorably 1 349 37
and 1 349 37
treated 1 349 37
women 1 349 37
with 1 349 37
respect… 1 349 37
Brett 0 349 37
attended 0 349 37
Georgetown 0 349 37
Prep, 0 349 37
an 0 349 37
all-boys 0 349 37
high 0 349 37
school 0 349 37
in 0 349 37
Rockville, 0 349 37
Maryland. 0 349 37

He 0 349 38
was 0 349 38
an 0 349 38
outstanding 0 349 38
student 0 349 38
and 0 349 38
athlete 0 349 38
with 0 349 38
a 0 349 38
wide 0 349 38
circle 0 349 38
of 0 349 38
friends. 0 349 38

Almost 0 349 39
all 0 349 39
of 0 349 39
us 0 349 39
attended 0 349 39
all-girls 0 349 39
high 0 349 39
schools 0 349 39
in 0 349 39
the 0 349 39
area. 0 349 39

We 0 349 40
knew 0 349 40
Brett 0 349 40
well 0 349 40
through 0 349 40
social 0 349 40
events, 0 349 40
sports, 0 349 40
church, 0 349 40
and 0 349 40
various 0 349 40
other 0 349 40
activities. 0 349 40

Many 0 349 41
of 0 349 41
us 0 349 41
have 0 349 41
remained 0 349 41
close 0 349 41
friends 0 349 41
with 0 349 41
him 0 349 41
and 0 349 41
his 0 349 41
family 0 349 41
over 0 349 41
the 0 349 41
years. 0 349 41

Through 0 349 42
the 0 349 42
more 0 349 42
than 0 349 42
35 0 349 42
years 0 349 42
we 0 349 42
have 0 349 42
known 0 349 42
him, 0 349 42
Brett 0 349 42
has 0 349 42
stood 0 349 42
out 0 349 42
for 0 349 42
his 0 349 42
friendship, 0 349 42
character, 0 349 42
and 0 349 42
integrity. 0 349 42

In 0 349 43
particular, 0 349 43
he 0 349 43
has 0 349 43
always 0 349 43
treated 0 349 43
women 0 349 43
with 0 349 43
decency 0 349 43
and 0 349 43
respect. 0 349 43

That 0 349 44
was 0 349 44
true 0 349 44
when 0 349 44
he 0 349 44
was 0 349 44
in 0 349 44
high 0 349 44
school, 0 349 44
and 0 349 44
it 0 349 44
has 0 349 44
remained 0 349 44
true 0 349 44
to 0 349 44
this 0 349 44
day. 0 349 44

The 0 349 45
signers 0 349 45
of 0 349 45
this 0 349 45
letter 0 349 45
hold 0 349 45
a 0 349 45
broad 0 349 45
range 0 349 45
of 0 349 45
political 0 349 45
views. 0 349 45

Many 0 349 46
of 0 349 46
us 0 349 46
are 0 349 46
not 0 349 46
lawyers, 0 349 46
but 0 349 46
we 0 349 46
know 0 349 46
Brett 0 349 46
Kavanaugh 0 349 46
as 0 349 46
a 0 349 46
person. 0 349 46

And 0 349 47
he 0 349 47
has 0 349 47
always 0 349 47
been 0 349 47
a 0 349 47
good 0 349 47
person. 0 349 47

Nevertheless, 0 349 48
using 0 349 48
their 1 349 48
standard 1 349 48
contemptible, 1 349 48
obstructionist 1 349 48
tactics, 1 349 48
the 0 349 48
Democrats 0 349 48
opposed 0 349 48
to 0 349 48
Judge 0 349 48
Kavanaugh 0 349 48
happily 0 349 48
seized 0 349 48
on 0 349 48
the 0 349 48
unsubstantiated 0 349 48
allegation 0 349 48
of 0 349 48
teen 0 349 48
sexual 0 349 48
misbehavior 0 349 48
in 0 349 48
high 0 349 48
school 0 349 48
to 0 349 48
assassinate 1 349 48
Judge 1 349 48
Kavanaugh’s 1 349 48
character. 1 349 48

They 0 349 49
have 0 349 49
done 0 349 49
so 0 349 49
in 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
face 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
Judge 0 349 49
Kavanaugh’s 0 349 49
lifetime 0 349 49
record 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
stellar 0 349 49
public 0 349 49
service, 0 349 49
multiple 0 349 49
background 0 349 49
checks 0 349 49
producing 0 349 49
no 0 349 49
evidence 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
sexual 0 349 49
misconduct, 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
letter 0 349 49
written 0 349 49
by 0 349 49
the 0 349 49
65 0 349 49
women, 0 349 49
who 0 349 49
knew 0 349 49
him 0 349 49
when 0 349 49
he 0 349 49
was 0 349 49
in 0 349 49
high 0 349 49
school 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
thereafter 0 349 49
and 0 349 49
who 0 349 49
signed 0 349 49
their 0 349 49
names 0 349 49
to 0 349 49
a 0 349 49
ringing 0 349 49
endorsement 0 349 49
of 0 349 49
his 0 349 49
good 0 349 49

other 0 349 53
Democrats, 0 349 53
including 0 349 53
Senator 0 349 53

"Senator 0 349 54
Grassley 0 349 54
must 0 349 54
postpone 0 349 54
the 0 349 54
vote 0 349 54
until, 0 349 54
at 0 349 54
a 0 349 54
very 0 349 54
minimum, 0 349 54
these 0 349 54
serious 0 349 54

credible 0 349 54

thoroughly 0 349 54
investigated,” 0 349 54
Senator 0 349 54

If 0 349 55
a 0 349 55

why 1 349 55
didn't 1 349 55
Senator 1 349 55

set 1 349 55
the 1 349 55
ball 1 349 55
rolling 1 349 55
back 1 349 55
in 1 349 55

she 1 349 55

received 1 349 55
word 1 349 55
of 1 349 55

The 0 349 56
answer 0 349 56
is 0 349 56
that 0 349 56
this 1 349 56
is 1 349 56
all 1 349 56
a 1 349 56

all 1 349 56

necessary. 1 349 56

Senator 0 349 57
Schumer 0 349 57

his 0 349 57
promise 0 349 57
