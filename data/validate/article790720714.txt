I'll 0 378 0
Say 0 378 0
What 0 378 0
Kavanaugh 0 378 0
Wouldn't: 0 378 0
Christine 0 378 0
Ford 0 378 0
Was 0 378 0
Part 0 378 0
Of 0 378 0
The 0 378 0
Political 0 378 0
Hit 0 378 0
On 0 378 0
Him 0 378 0
& 0 378 0
Here's 0 378 0
The 0 378 0
Audio 0 378 0
Evidence 0 378 0

On 0 378 1
Thursday, 0 378 1
following 0 378 1
the 0 378 1
hearings 0 378 1
where 0 378 1
Dr. 0 378 1
Christine 0 378 1
Ford 0 378 1
provided 0 378 1
testimony 0 378 1
under 0 378 1
oath 0 378 1
without 0 378 1
any 0 378 1
evidence 0 378 1
at 0 378 1
all 0 378 1
of 0 378 1
a 0 378 1
36-year-old 0 378 1
alleged 0 378 1
sexual 0 378 1
attack 0 378 1
by 0 378 1
Supreme 0 378 1
Court 0 378 1
nominee 0 378 1
Brett 0 378 1
Kavanaugh 0 378 1
and 0 378 1
his 0 378 1
friend 0 378 1
Mark 0 378 1
Judge, 0 378 1
Kavanaugh 0 378 1
denied 0 378 1
the 0 378 1
allegations 0 378 1
and 0 378 1
blasted 1 378 1
Senate 1 378 1
Democrats 1 378 1
for 0 378 1
their 0 378 1
involvement 0 378 1
in 0 378 1
ruining 0 378 1
his 0 378 1
good 0 378 1
name. 0 378 1

However, 0 378 2
when 0 378 2
asked 0 378 2
by 0 378 2
Senator 0 378 2
Cory 0 378 2
Booker 0 378 2
whether 0 378 2
or 0 378 2
not 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
thought 0 378 2
Ford 0 378 2
was 0 378 2
part 0 378 2
of 0 378 2
what 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
referred 0 378 2
to 0 378 2
as 0 378 2
a 0 378 2
"political 1 378 2
hit" 1 378 2
against 0 378 2
him, 0 378 2
Kavanaugh 0 378 2
rightly 0 378 2
steered 0 378 2
clear 0 378 2
of 0 378 2
a 0 378 2
public 1 378 2
relations 1 378 2
disaster. 1 378 2

However, 0 378 3
I 0 378 3
am 0 378 3
willing 0 378 3
to 0 378 3
say 0 378 3
would 0 378 3
he 0 378 3
would 0 378 3
not: 0 378 3
Of 1 378 3
course, 1 378 3
she 1 378 3
was 1 378 3
part 1 378 3
of 1 378 3
it! 1 378 3

I 0 378 4
don't 0 378 4
say 0 378 4
this 0 378 4
lightly. 0 378 4

There 0 378 5
are 0 378 5
many 0 378 5
things 0 378 5
that 0 378 5
we 0 378 5
heard 0 378 5
from 0 378 5
Ford 0 378 5
on 0 378 5
Thursday 0 378 5
that 0 378 5
indicate 0 378 5
there 0 378 5
is 0 378 5
more 0 378 5
going 0 378 5
on 0 378 5
than 0 378 5
she 0 378 5
was 0 378 5
willing 0 378 5
to 0 378 5
say. 0 378 5

Clearly, 0 378 6
Ford 0 378 6
has 0 378 6
been 0 378 6
outed 0 378 6
as 0 378 6
a 1 378 6
radical 1 378 6
political 1 378 6
activist 1 378 6
who 1 378 6
promotes 1 378 6
baby 1 378 6
murder 1 378 6
and 1 378 6
other 1 378 6
unlawful 1 378 6
actions. 1 378 6

However, 0 378 7
her 1 378 7
story 1 378 7
didn't 1 378 7
exactly 1 378 7
lend 1 378 7
credibility 1 378 7
except 0 378 7
with 0 378 7
Democrat 0 378 7
members 0 378 7

Senate 0 378 7
Judiciary 0 378 7
Committee, 0 378 7
one 0 378 7
of 0 378 7
which 0 378 7
has 0 378 7
openly 0 378 7
professed 0 378 7
to 0 378 7
sexual 0 378 7
assault. 0 378 7

However, 0 378 18
Ford 0 378 18
claims 0 378 18
she 0 378 18
never 0 378 18
authorized 0 378 18
her 0 378 18
July 0 378 18
letter 0 378 18
to 0 378 18
Senator 0 378 18

to 0 378 18

made 0 378 18
public 0 378 18
and 0 378 18
yet, 0 378 18
it 0 378 18
was. 0 378 18

She 0 378 19
didn't 0 378 19
seem 0 378 19
distraught 0 378 19
over 0 378 19
that. 0 378 19

She 1 378 20
wasn't 1 378 20
angry 1 378 20
it 1 378 20
was 1 378 20
made 1 378 20
public. 1 378 20

Why? 1 378 21

She 1 378 22
knew 1 378 22
it 1 378 22
would 1 378 22
be 1 378 22
made 1 378 22
public. 1 378 22

Ricki 0 378 23
Seidman, 0 378 23
a 0 378 23
Democratic 0 378 23
operative 0 378 23
and 0 378 23
former 0 378 23
Clinton 0 378 23

House 0 378 23
official 0 378 23
who 0 378 23
is 0 378 23
now 0 378 23
an 0 378 23
advisor 0 378 23
to 0 378 23
Mrs. 0 378 23
Ford, 0 378 23
said 0 378 23
in 0 378 23
July 0 378 23
(at 0 378 23
roughly 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
same 0 378 23
time 0 378 23
as 0 378 23
the 0 378 23
letter 0 378 23
was 0 378 23
submitted) 0 378 23
that 0 378 23
she 0 378 23
predicted 0 378 23
a 0 378 23
"strategy" 0 378 23
forming 0 378 23
to 1 378 23
destroy 1 378 23
Brett 1 378 23
Kavanaugh. 1 378 23

She 0 378 24
suggested 0 378 24
a 0 378 24
“strategy 0 378 24
will 0 378 24
emerge” 0 378 24
to 1 378 24
destroy 1 378 24
Trump's 1 378 24
nomination 1 378 24
for 1 378 24
the 1 378 24
Supreme 1 378 24
Court 1 378 24
in 0 378 24
a 0 378 24
conference 0 378 24
call 0 378 24
with 0 378 24
the 0 378 24
American 0 378 24
Constitution 0 378 24
Society 0 378 24
in 0 378 24
July. 0 378 24

“I 0 378 25
do 0 378 25
think 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
over 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
coming 0 378 25
days 0 378 25
and 0 378 25
weeks 0 378 25
there 0 378 25
will 0 378 25
be 0 378 25
a 0 378 25
strategy 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
will 0 378 25
emerge, 0 378 25
and 0 378 25
I 0 378 25
think 0 378 25
it’s 0 378 25
possible 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
strategy 0 378 25
might 0 378 25
ultimately 0 378 25
defeat 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
nominee,” 0 378 25
Seidman 0 378 25
said 0 378 25
in 0 378 25
audio 0 378 25
that 0 378 25
was 0 378 25
recorded 0 378 25
by 0 378 25
the 0 378 25
Republican 0 378 25
National 0 378 25
Committee’s 0 378 25
War 0 378 25
Room. 0 378 25

“And 1 378 26
whether 1 378 26
or 1 378 26
not 1 378 26
it 1 378 26
ultimately 1 378 26
defeats 1 378 26
the 1 378 26
nominee 1 378 26
it 1 378 26
will, 1 378 26
I 1 378 26
think, 1 378 26
help 1 378 26
people 1 378 26
understand 1 378 26
why 1 378 26
it’s 1 378 26
so 1 378 26
important 1 378 26
that 1 378 26
they 1 378 26
vote.” 1 378 26

If 1 378 27
you 1 378 27
think 1 378 27
Mrs. 1 378 27
Ford 1 378 27
is 1 378 27
ignorant 1 378 27
of 1 378 27
this 1 378 27
considering 1 378 27
her 1 378 27
father 1 378 27
works 1 378 27
for 1 378 27
the 1 378 27
Central 1 378 27
Intelligence 1 378 27
Agency 1 378 27
and 1 378 27
her 1 378 27
prior 1 378 27
criminal 1 378 27
political 1 378 27
activism, 1 378 27
then 1 378 27
you 1 378 27
aren't 1 378 27
thinking 1 378 27
clearly. 1 378 27

Ford 1 378 28
obviously 1 378 28
has 1 378 28
mental 1 378 28
issues 1 378 28
and 1 378 28
that 1 378 28
was 1 378 28
on 1 378 28
display 1 378 28
on 1 378 28
Thursday 1 378 28
during 1 378 28
her 1 378 28
testimony. 1 378 28

She 0 378 29
clearly 0 378 29
tried 0 378 29
to 0 378 29
present 0 378 29
herself 0 378 29
as 0 378 29
a 0 378 29
victim 0 378 29
while 0 378 29
she 0 378 29
accused 0 378 29
Kavanaugh 0 378 29
of 0 378 29
sexual 0 378 29
assault 0 378 29
with 0 378 29
absolutely 1 378 29
no 1 378 29
evidence. 1 378 29

Kavanaugh 0 378 30
even 0 378 30
responded 0 378 30
by 0 378 30
pointing 0 378 30
out 0 378 30
that 0 378 30
even 0 378 30
her 0 378 30
friends 0 378 30
said 0 378 30
they 0 378 30
don't 0 378 30
recall 0 378 30
such 0 378 30
an 0 378 30
incident 0 378 30
and 0 378 30
had 0 378 30
literally 0 378 30
hundreds 0 378 30
of 0 378 30
people 0 378 30
commend 0 378 30
his 0 378 30
character 0 378 30
as 0 378 30
the 0 378 30
direct 0 378 30
opposite 0 378 30
of 0 378 30
what 0 378 30
Ford 0 378 30
claims. 0 378 30

As 0 378 31
I've 0 378 31
said 0 378 31
before, 0 378 31
I 0 378 31
don't 0 378 31
support 0 378 31
Kavanaugh's 0 378 31
appointment 0 378 31
to 0 378 31
the 0 378 31
Supreme 0 378 31
Court 0 378 31
on 0 378 31
the 0 378 31
grounds 0 378 31
of 0 378 31
lack 0 378 31
of 0 378 31
constitutional 0 378 31
rulings, 0 378 31
but 0 378 31
that 1 378 31
attack 1 378 31
on 1 378 31
him 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
orchestrated, 1 378 31
it 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
political 1 378 31
and 1 378 31
Ford 1 378 31
was 1 378 31
a 1 378 31
part 1 378 31
of 1 378 31
it. 1 378 31

It's 0 378 32
wrong. 0 378 32

Ford 0 378 33
didn't 0 378 33
even 0 378 33
think 0 378 33
to 0 378 33
act, 0 378 33
according 0 378 33
to 0 378 33
her 0 378 33
testimony, 0 378 33
until 0 378 33
Kavanaugh 0 378 33
was 0 378 33
on 0 378 33
the 0 378 33
short 0 378 33
list, 0 378 33
but 1 378 33
did 1 378 33
she 1 378 33
go 1 378 33
to 1 378 33
local 1 378 33
law 1 378 33
enforcement? 1 378 33

Nope. 0 378 34

She 0 378 35
went 0 378 35
to 0 378 35
her 0 378 35
US 0 378 35
Democrat 0 378 35
representative, 0 378 35
Senator 0 378 35
Dianne 0 378 35
Feinstein 0 378 35
and 0 378 35
The 0 378 35
Washington 0 378 35
Post. 0 378 35

If 0 378 36
that 0 378 36
is 0 378 36
not 0 378 36
political, 0 378 36
I 0 378 36
don't 0 378 36
know 0 378 36
what 0 378 36
is. 0 378 36

Ford 1 378 37
is 1 378 37
not 1 378 37
seeking 1 378 37
justice 1 378 37
nor 1 378 37
is 1 378 37
she 1 378 37
seeking 1 378 37
to 1 378 37
do 1 378 37
her 1 378 37
"civic 1 378 37
duty." 1 378 37

She 1 378 38
is 1 378 38
seeking 1 378 38
to 1 378 38
slander 1 378 38
a 1 378 38
man's 1 378 38
character 1 378 38
for 1 378 38
something 1 378 38
she 1 378 38
cannot 1 378 38
prove 1 378 38
that 1 378 38
she 1 378 38
claims 1 378 38
happened 1 378 38
over 1 378 38
36 1 378 38
