Geert 0
Wilders 0
Puts 0
the 0
Political 0
Elites 0
On 0
Notice 0

Geert 0
Wilders 0
spoke 0
at 0
a 0
massive 0
rally 0
for 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
on 0
Saturday. 0

20,000 0
people 0
came 0
out 0
to 0
call 0
for 0
Tommy’s 0
release, 0
and 0
Wilders 0
took 0
the 0
opportunity 0
to 0
put 0
the 0
political 0
elites 0
of 0
Britain 0
and 0
continental 0
Europe 0
on 0
notice. 0

“Our 1
governments,” 1
Wilders 0
declared, 0
“sold 0
us 0
out 0
with 0
mass 0
immigration. 0

With 0
Islamization. 0

With 0
open 0
borders. 0

We 0
are 0
almost 0
foreigners 0
in 0
our 0
own 0
lands. 0

And 0
if 0
we 0
complain 0
about 0
it, 0
they 0
call 0
us 0
racists 1
and 1
Islamophobes. 1

But 0
I 0
say, 0
no 1
more! 1

And 0
what 0
do 0
you 0
say? 0

No 1
more! 1

And 0
that’s 0
right: 0
enough 0
is 0
enough. 0

We 0
will 0
not 0
be 0
gagged 0
anymore. 0

No 1
more 1
tyranny.” 1

It 0
was 0
extraordinary 0
that 0
the 0
British 0
authorities 0
allowed 0
Wilders 0
into 0
the 0
country 0
at 0
all. 0

Several 0
years 0
ago 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
country, 0
but 0
although 0
the 0
ban 0
was 0
reversed 0
on 0
appeal, 0
the 0
British 0
government 0
recently 0
banned 0
Martin 0
Sellner, 0
Brittany 0
Pettibone, 0
Lauren 0
Southern 0
and 0
Lutz 0
Bachmann 0
from 0
entering, 0
all 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
opposing 0
jihad 0
terror 0
and 0
Sharia 0
oppression, 0
and 0
thereby 0
made 0
it 0
clear 0
that 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
authoritarian 0
and 0
unwilling 0
to 0
uphold 0
the 0
freedom 0
of 0
speech 0
than 0
ever 0
– 0
at 0
least 0
when 0
it 0
comes 0
to 0
criticism 0
of 0
Islam, 0
Muslim 1
rape 1
gangs, 1
and 0
mass 0
Muslim 0
migration. 0

Even 0
worse, 0
the 0
bannings 0
of 0
Sellner, 0
Pettibone, 0
Southern, 0
and 0
Bachmann 0
were 0
just 0
part 0
of 0
a 0
long 0
pattern. 0

Pamela 0
Geller 0
and 0
I 0
were 0
banned 0
from 0
entering 0
Britain 0
in 0
2013, 0
apparently 0
for 0
life, 0
also 0
for 0
the 0
crime 0
of 0
telling 0
the 1
truth 1
about 1
Islam 1
and 1
jihad. 1

Meanwhile, 0
Britain 0
has 0
a 0
steadily 0
lengthening 0
record 0
of 0
admitting 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
without 1
a 1
moment 1
of 1
hesitation. 1

Syed 0
Muzaffar 0
Shah 0
Qadri’s 0
preaching 1
of 1
hatred 1
and 1
jihad 1
violence 1
was 0
so 0
hardline 1
that 0
he 0
was 0
banned 0
from 0
preaching 0
in 0
Pakistan, 0
but 0
the 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
welcomed 0
him 0
into 0
Britain. 0

The 0
UK 0
Home 0
Office 0
also 0
admitted 0
Shaykh 0
Hamza 0
Sodagar 0
into 0
the 0
country, 0
despite 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
he 0
has 0
said: 0
“If 0
there’s 0
homosexual 0
men, 0
the 0
punishment 0
is 0
one 0
of 0
five 0
things. 0

One 0
– 0
the 0
easiest 0
one 0
maybe 0
– 0
chop 0
their 0
head 0
off, 0
that’s 0
the 0
easiest. 0

Second 0
– 0
burn 0
them 0
to 0
death. 0

Third 0
– 0
throw 0
’em 0
off 0
a 0
cliff. 0

Fourth 0
– 0
tear 0
down 0
a 0
wall 0
on 0
them 0
so 0
they 0
die 0
under 0
that. 0

Fifth 0
– 0
a 0
combination 0
of 0
the 0
above.” 0

Theresa 0
May’s 0
relentlessly 1
appeasement-minded 1
government 0
also 0
admitted 0
two 0
jihad 0
preachers 0
who 0
had 0
praised 0
the 0
murderer 0
of 0
a 0
foe 0
of 0
Pakistan’s 0
blasphemy 0
laws. 0

One 0
of 0
them 0
was 0
welcomed 0
by 0
the 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Canterbury. 0

Meanwhile, 0
the 0
UK 0
banned 0
three 0
bishops 0
from 0
areas 0
of 0
Iraq 0
and 0
Syria 0
where 0
Christians 0
are 0
persecuted 0
from 0
entering 0
the 0
country. 0

But 0
now 0
matters 0
are 0
coming 0
to 0
a 0
head. 0

Apparently 0
British 0
authorities 0
decided 0
that 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
too 0
politically 0
costly 0
for 0
them 0
to 0
bar 0
Wilders 0
again. 0

And 0
so 0
he 0
entered, 0
and 0
spoke, 0
and 0
gave 0
them 0
a 0
strong 0
dose 0
of 0
the 0
reality 1
that 0
they 0
are 0
determined 0
to 0
ignore 0
and 0
deny. 0

Tommy 0
Robinson 0
is 0
in 0
prison 0
today 0
because 0
he 0
violated 0
a 0
court 0
order 0
demanding 0
that 0
he 0
not 0
film 0
videos 0
outside 0
the 0
trials 0
of 0
Muslim 1
rape 1
gangs. 1

Clearly 0
the 1
government’s 1
intent 1
was 1
to 1
make 1
sure 1
that 1
as 1
few 1
people 1
as 1
possible 1
discovered 1
the 1
truth 1
about 0
its 0
massive, 0
years-long 0
cover-up 0
of 0
those 0
rape 1
gangs, 1
and 0
refusal 0
to 0
prosecute 0
the 0
perpetrators. 0

Theresa 0
May 0
and 0
company 0
obvious 0
hope 0
that 0
other 0
Britons 0
who 0
are 0
furious 0
about 0
the 0
sacrifice 1
of 1
thousands 1
of 0
British 1
girls 1
to 0
the 0
idols 0
of 0
“diversity” 0
and 0
“multiculturalism” 0
will 0
see 0
what 0
happened 0
to 0
Tommy, 0
and 0
be 0
frightened 0
into 0
silence. 0

The 0
British 0
government, 0
in 0
imprisoning 0
Tommy 0
Robinson, 0
has 0
shown 0
itself 0
willing 0
to 0
incarcerate 0
people 0
for 0
having 0
opinions 0
that 0
it 0
considers 0
unacceptable. 0

That 0
heralds 0
the 1
death 1
of 1
Britain 1
as 1
a 1
free 1
society 1
and 0
the 0
beginning 1
of 1
an 1
authoritarian 1
police 1
state 1
there, 0
unless 1
this 1
slide 1
to 1
totalitarianism 1
is 1
stopped 1
now. 1

British 0
public 0
figures, 0
whatever 0
criticism 0
they 0
have 0
leveled 0
against 0
Tommy 0
Robinson 0
in 0
the 0
past, 0
should 0
be 0
calling 0
for 0
him 0
to 0
be 0
freed 0
today, 0
or 1
else 1
they 1
will 1
be 1
exposing 1
themselves 1
as 1
supporting 1
the 1
degeneration 1
of 1
Britain 1
into 0
a 0
police 0
state. 0

Wilders 0
addressed 0
this 0
endeavor 0
head-on, 0
declaring: 0
“We 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
silenced. 1

We 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
intimidated. 1

And 1
we 1
tell 1
the 1
governments, 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
afraid 1
of 1
you. 1

We 1
will 1
never 1
surrender. 1

We 1
will 1
stand 1
strong 1
and 1
do 1
our 1
duty. 1

We 1
will 1
defend 1
our 1
civilization. 1

And 1
we 1
will 1
protect 1
our 1
people.” 1

Wilders 0
added: 0
“And 0
I 0
tell 0
you, 0
to 0
the 0
governments. 0

You 0
can 0
throw 0
us 0
in 0
jail, 0
but 0
you 0
will 0
never 0
defeat 0
us. 0

Because, 0
my 0
friends, 0
for 0
every 0
Tommy 0
whom 0
you 0
imprison, 0
thousands 0
will 0
rise 0
up. 0

So 0
take 1
notice, 1
Theresa 0
May. 0

Take 1
notice, 1
Dutch 0
Prime 0
Minister 0
Rutte. 0

Take 1
notice, 1
Mrs. 0
Merkel 0
or 0
President 0
Macron. 0

Take 1
notice: 1
the 1
future 1
is 1
ours 1
and 1
not 1
yours. 1

We 0
will 0
defeat 0
you 0
politically, 0
because 0
we, 0
my 0
friends, 0
we 1
are 1
the 1
people.” 1

If 1
Wilders’ 1
words 1
don’t 1
prove 1
true, 1
it 1
will 1
be 1
because 1
the 1
death 1
of 1
free 1
societies 1
in 1
Britain 1
and 1
Western 1
Europe 1
is 1
truly 1
at 1
hand. 1
