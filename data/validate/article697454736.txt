In 0

the 0
article 0
that 0
I 0
co-authored 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein, 0
we 0
would 0
have 0
done 0
better 0
to 0
speak 0
of 0
the 0
“official” 0
Latin 0
text 0
rather 0
than 0
the 0
“original” 0
Latin 0
text. 0

This, 0
though, 0
is 0
no 0
longer 0
an 0
issue 0
because 0
the 0
normative 0
text 0
is 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
published 0
in 0
thr 0
AAS. 0

Mr. 1
Ferrara, 1
however, 1
bases 1
his 1
critique 1
upon 1
an 1
assumption 1
that 1
the 1
“generous 1
response” 1
offered 1
to 1
God 1
is 1
a 1
sin. 1

This, 1
though, 1
is 1
not 1
what 1
AL 1
is 1
saying. 1

The 0
generous 0
response 0
is 0
a 0
move 0
away 0
from 0
sin 0
and 0
a 0
move 0
toward 0
God. 0

I 0
explain 0
this 0
in 0
my 0
most 0
recent 0
response 0
to 0
Prof. 0
E. 0
Christian 0
Brugger, 0
which 0
can 0
serve 0
as 0
my 0
response 0
to 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara: 0

Posted 0

on 0
LifeSiteNews: 0

Prof. 0
Brugger 0
is 0
a 0
good 0
theologian 0
and 0
a 0
fine 0
man, 0
but 0
he 0
still 0
seems 0
to 0
believe 0
that 0
AL 0
303 0
implies 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
people 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
sin 0
in 0
some 0
cases. 0

In 0
his 0
April 0
22, 0
2016 0
article 0
in 0
Catholic 0
World 0
Report, 0
Brugger 0
writes 0
that 0
AL 0
303 0
suggests 0
that 0
“God 0
can 0
be 0
‘asking’ 0
someone 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
a 0
life-state 0
in 0
which 0
they 0
are 0
objectively 0
violating 0
grave 0
matter.” 0
Then 0
in 0
a 0
Sept. 0
28 0
‘17 0
LifeSiteNews 0
article, 0
he 0
states 0
that 0
“the 0
generous 0
response” 0
owed 0
to 0
God 0
is 0
“a 0
certain 0
state 0
that 0
is 0
objectively 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
universal 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel.” 0
Now 0
Prof. 0
Brugger 0
argues 0
that, 0
because 0
the 0
subject 0
remains 0
“this 0
conscience” 0
in 0
AL 0
303, 0
this 0
proves 0
that 0
the 0
“generous 0
offering 0
owed 0
to 0
God” 0
is 0
the 0
recognition 0
that 0
one 0
is 0
living 0
“contrary 0
to 0
“the 0
universal 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel.” 0

Prof. 0

Brugger 0
fails 0
to 0
see 0
that 0
AL 0
303 0
clearly 0
distinguishes 0
between 0
a 0
conscience’s 0
recognition 0
that 0
“a 0
given 0
situation 0
is 0
objectively 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
general 0
mandate 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel” 0
and 0
this 0
same 0
conscience’s 0
subsequent 0
recognition 0
of 0
a 0
“generous 0
response 0
owed 0
to 0
God 0
in 0
the 0
present 0
circumstances.” 0
The 0
subject 0
“conscience” 0
might 0
be 0
the 0
same 0
but 0
the 0
object 0
is 0
different. 0

The 0
“generous 0
response” 0
is 0
not 0
the 0
situation 0
that 0
is 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel 0
but 0
an 0
offering 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
amid 0
the 0
mass 0
of 0
impediments 0
even 0
though 0
it 0
may 0
not 0
yet 0
be 0
the 0
perfect 0
objective 0
model. 0

What 0

might 0
be 0
this 0
“generous 0
response?” 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
does 0
not 0
give 0
an 0
example 0
in 0
AL 0
303 0
because 0
he’s 0
speaking 0
in 0
general 0
terms 0
of 0
the 0
dynamics 0
of 0
conscience. 0

Moreover, 0
he 0
knows 0
that 0
concrete 0
cases 0
vary 0
widely. 0

In 0
our 0
Sept. 0
26 0
article 0
in 0
La 0
Stampa, 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein 0
and 0
I 0
provided 0
a 0
hypothetical 0
example 0
of 0
a 0
couple 0
in 0
a 0
purely 0
civil 0
“marriage” 0
recognizing 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
calling 0
them 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
continence. 0

We 0
chose 0
this 0
example 0
deliberately 0
to 0
demonstrate 0
that 0
“the 0
generous 0
response” 0
could 0
be 0
the 0
ending 0
of 0
a 0
particular 0
sin. 0

Our 0
example 0
was 0
an 0
attempt 0
to 0
show 0
that 0
Professors 0
Brugger 0
and 0
Seifert 0
are 0
wrong 0
to 0
believe 0
AL 0
303 0
implies 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
some 0
people 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
an 0
objectively 0
sinful 0
state. 0

It’s 0
really 0
just 0
the 0
opposite. 0

AL 0
303 0
teaches 0
that 0
conscience 0
will 0
come 0
to 0
recognize 0
that 0
God 0
is 0
asking 0
for 0
a 0
step 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction 0
away 0
from 0
sin. 0

Pope 1
Francis 1
explains 1
this 1
again 1
in 1
AL 1
305 1
when 1
he 1
says 1
“a 1
small 1
step, 1
in 1
the 1
midst 1
of 1
great 1
human 1
limitations, 1
can 1
be 1
more 1
pleasing 1
to 1
God 1
than 1
a 1
life 1
which 1
appears 1
outwardly 1
in 1
order, 1
but 0
moves 0
through 0
the 0
day 0
without 0
confronting 0
great 0
difficulties.’” 0

In 0

a 0
recent 0
interview 0
(http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., 0
the 0
Italian 0
philosopher, 0
Rocco 0
Buttiglione, 0
provides 0
this 0
example 0
for 0
AL 0
303: 0
“Imagine 0
a 0
father 0
who 0
has 0
a 0
sick 0
son 0
and 0
the 0
child 0
improves. 0

He 0
still 0
has 0
fever 0
but 0
has 0
stopped 0
vomiting; 0
the 0
child 0
manages 0
to 0
keep 0
in 0
his 0
stomach 0
what 0
he 0
eats 0
and 0
has 0
started 0
a 0
therapy 0
that 0
seems 0
to 0
work. 0

The 0
father 0
is 0
happy. 0

Is 0
he 0
happy 0
about 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
child 0
is 0
sick? 0

No, 0
he 0
is 0
pleased 0
that 0
his 0
son 0
gives 0
symptoms 0
of 0
improvement 0
and 0
healing.” 0

This 0

is 0
what 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
is 0
saying 0
in 0
AL 0
303. 0

God 0
is 0
not 0
happy 0
with 0
situations 0
that 0
are 0
objectively 0
at 0
variance 0
with 0
the 0
command 0
of 0
the 0
Gospel. 0

God, 0
however, 0
is 0
happy 0
when 0
people 0
in 0
such 0
situations 0
discern 0
in 0
conscience 0
that 0
He 0
is 0
asking 0
them 0
to 0
make 0
a 0
choice 0
that 0
moves 0
in 0
the 0
right 0
direction—even 0
if 0
they 0
still 0
need 0
to 0
progress 0
further 0
toward 0
a 0
more 0
complete 0
fulfillment 0
of 0
His 0
will. 0

This 0
is 0
the 0
law 0
of 0
gradualness 0
not 0
the 0
gradualness 0
of 0
the 0
law. 0

It 0
is 0
sad 0
that 0
this 0
beautiful 0
and 0
compassionate 0
message 0
of 0
AL 0
303 0
has 0
been 0
so 0
completely 0
misunderstood 0
by 0
scholars 0
who 0
have 0
failed 0
to 0
grasp 0
its 0
true 0
meaning. 0

I 0

certainly 0
agree 0
that 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
is 0
the 0
normative 0
text 0
even 0
if 0
it 0
comes 0
later. 0

I 0
certainly 0
do 0
not 0
agree 0
that 0
the 0
Latin 0
text 0
eliminates 0
the 0
grave 0
problems 0
with 0
Amoris 0
Laetitia. 0

Rather, 0
as 0
I 0
show 0
in 0
my 0
article, 0
it 0
only 0
intensifies 0
them. 0

With 1

all 1
due 1
respect 1
to 1
Dr. 1
Fastiggi, 1
his 1
argument 1
and 1
that 1
of 1
Buttiglione, 1
that 1
a 1
“move 1
away 1
from 1
sin” 1
is 1
what 1
is 1
pleasing 1
to 1
God, 1
even 1
if 1
the 1
moral 1
norm 1
is 1
not 1
adhered 1
to, 1
is 1
sophistical. 1

What 0
constitutes 0
a 0
“move 0
away” 0
from 0
sin 0
if 0
not 0
ceasing 0
to 0
commit 0
the 0
sin? 0

No 0
example 0
is 0
provided 0
in 0
AL 0
because 0
none 0
can 0
be. 0

The 0
notion 0
is 0
nonsensical. 0

Just 0
how 0
nonsensical 0
is 0
demonstrated 0
by 0
Dr. 0
Fastiggi’s 0
claim 0
that 0
by 0
“a 0
move 0
away 0
from 0
sin” 0
in 0
the 0
case 0
of 0
a 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
couple 0
Francis 0
means 0
their 0
agreement 0
to 0
live 0
in 0
continence 0
as 0
brother 0
and 0
sister 0
for 0
the 0
sake 0
of 0
children. 0

But 0
that 0
would 0
be 0
ceasing 0
to 0
commit 0
the 0
sin 0
of 0
adultery 0
altogether 0
as 0
it 0
would 0
involve 0
abandoning 0
the 0
pretense 0
that 0
they 0
are 0
married 0
along 0
with 0
the 0
illicit 0
sexual 0
relation 0
itself. 0

Such 0
a 0
couple 0
could 0
always 0
be 0
absolved 0
and 0
receive 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
under 0
the 0
Church’s 0
constant 0
practice, 0
albeit 0
privately 0
to 0
avoid 0
scandal. 0

At 0

any 0
rate, 0
the 0
“brother 0
and 0
sister” 0
approach 0
to 0
the 0
situation, 0
which 0
is 0
that 0
of 0
Familiaris 0
consortio 0
84, 0
is 0
certainly 0
not 0
the 0
one 0
advocated 0
by 0
Francis. 0

As 0
my 0
article 0
shows, 0
Francis 0
has 0
made 0
it 0
quite 0
clear 0
that 0
he 0
approves 0
of 0
admitting 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
people 0
who 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
live 0
as 0
if 0
they 0
were 0
married, 0
including 0
sexual 0
relations, 0
while 0
“discerning” 0
their 0
situation, 0
this 0
“discernment” 0
being 0
a 0
mere 0
fig 0
leaf 0
to 0
conceal 0
the 0
proposed 0
toleration 0
of 0
public 0
adultery 0
in 0
the 0
Church. 0

Thus, 0
Francis 0
thanked 0
the 0
Maltese 0
bishops 0
for 0
their 0
AL 0
guidelines, 0
which 0
literally 0
mandate 0
admission 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
divorced 0
and 0
“remarried” 0
people 0
who 0
believe 0
themselves 0
to 0
be 0
“at 0
peace 0
with 0
God.” 0
And, 0
as 0
he 0
told 0
the 0
bishops 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires 0
in 0
writing, 0
“there 0
is 0
no 0
other 0
interpretation.” 0

No 0

amount 0
of 0
verbal 0
artifice 0
can 0
conceal 0
what 0
is 0
happening 0
in 0
the 0
Church 0
thanks 0
to 0
AL: 0
Public 0
adulterers 0
are 0
being 0
admitted 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
without 0
an 0
amendment 0
of 0
life 0
and 0
the 0
bimillenial 0
discipline 0
of 0
the 0
Church---which 0
John 0
Paul 0
insisted 0
involves 0
a 0
moral 0
norm, 0
not 0
a 0
mere 0
ecclesiastical 0
law, 0
to 0
which 0
everyone 0
is 0
bound 0
in 0
conscience 0
“without 0
exception”---is 0
being 0
overthrown 0
in 0
place 0
after 0
place. 0

It 0

is 0
a 0
great 0
disservice 0
to 0
the 0
Church 0
to 0
maintain 0
the 0
pretense 0
that 0
there 0
is 0
nothing 0
problematical 0
about 0
AL. 0

A 1
moral 1
catastrophe 1
is 1
self-evidently 1
underway 1
and 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
possible 1
honestly 1
to 1
deny 1
its 1
cause. 1

like 0
to 0
thank 0
Christopher 0
Ferrara 0
again 0
for 0
calling 0
attention 0
to 0
an 0
article 0
I 0
co-authored 0
with 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein 0
in 0
La 0
Stampa. 0

I 0
give 0
him 0
credit 0
for 0
his 0
colorful 0
style. 0

Unfortunately, 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara 0
provides 0
no 0
real 0
evidence 0
for 0
his 0
claim 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
“wishes 0
the 0
bishops 0
to 0
admit 0
public 0
adulterers 0
in 0
'second 0
marriages' 0
to 0

mentions 1
the 1
Holy 1
Father's 1

to 1
the 1

the 1

can 1
be 1
interpreted 1
in 1
an 1
orthodox 1
way, 1
as 0

of 0
the 0
possibility 0
of 0
“access 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
of 0
Reconciliation 0
and 0
the 0
Eucharist.” 0
This 0
could 0
reasonably 0
be 0
interpreted 0
as 0
going 0
to 0
confession 0
before 0
receiving 0
Holy 0
Communion. 0

The 0

same 0
applies 0
to 0
statements 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
and 0
Cardinal 0
Schoenborn 0
mentioned 0
by 0
Ferrara. 0

Pope 0
Francis 0
defers 0
to 0
the 0
exposition 0
of 0
Amoris 0
laetitia 0
by 0
Cardinal 0
Schoenborn 0
given 0
in 0
April 0
2016 0
when 0
the 0
exhortation 0
was 0
made 0
public. 0

I 1
have 1
read 1
the 1
Cardinal's 1
exposition 1
in 1
both 1
Italian 1
and 1
English, 1
and 1
I 1
only 1
find 1
mention 1
of 1
the 1
help 1
of 1
the 1
sacraments 1
in 1
certain 1
cases. 1

Once 0
again, 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara 0
assumes 0
this 0
means 0
access 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion 0
without 0
prior 0
sacramental 0
confession. 0

With 0
regard 0
to 0
the 0
letter 0
thanking 0
the 0
Bishops 0
of 0
Malta, 0
it 0
should 0
be 0
noted 0
that 0
Edward 0
Pentin 0
mentions 0
a 0
letter 0
of 0
Cardinal 0
Baldiserri 0
not 0
a 0
letter 0
of 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

Moreover, 0
this 0
letter 0
has 0
not 0
been 0
made 0
public 0
so 0
we 0
don't 0
know 0
exactly 0
what 0
it 0
says 0
other 0
than 0
an 0
expression 0
of 0
thanks. 0

This 0
seems 0
to 0
be 0
very 0
thin 0
evidence 0
for 0
claiming 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
wishes 0
the 0
bishops 0
to 0
admit 0
public 0
adulterers 0
to 0
the 0
sacraments 0
while 0
continuing 0
in 0
their 0
adulterous 0
relations. 0

As 0
a 0
lawyer, 0
Ferrara 0
should 0
have 0
a 0
better 0
sense 0
of 0
what 0
really 0
counts 0
as 0
evidence. 0

As 0
a 0
Christian, 0
he 0
should 0
also 0
be 0
mindful 0
of 0
the 0
command 0
against 0
bearing 0
false 0
witness. 0

Beyond 0

these 0
considerations, 0
I 0
wish 0
to 0
express 0
a 0
personal 0
concern 0
I 0
have 0
about 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara's 0
standing 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church. 0

He 0
says 0
that 0
Dr. 0
Goldstein 0
and 0
I 0
are 0
“foot 1
soldiers 1
of 1
a 1
Leviathan 1
Church” 1
because 0
we 0
defend 0
the 0
Roman 0
Pontiff. 0

Does 1
Mr. 1
Ferrara 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church 1
under 1
Pope 1
Francis 1
is 1
a 1
“Leviathan 1
Church” 1
and 1
not 1
the 1
Catholic 1
Church? 1

If 1
this 1
is 1
so, 1
then 1
it 1
would 1
suggest 1
that 1
Mr. 1
Ferrara 1
is 1
refusing 1
submission 1
to 1
the 1
Roman 1
Pontiff 1
and 1
communion 1
with 1
the 1
members 1
of 1
the 1
Church 1
subject 1
to 1
him. 1

This, 0
though, 0
is 0
the 0
very 0
definition 0
of 0
schism 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
Catechism 0
of 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church, 0
2089 0
and 0
the 0
1983 0
CIC 0
canon 0
751. 0

I 0
hope 0
Mr. 0
Ferrara 0
can 0
clarify 0
what 0
he 0
means 0
by 0
the 0
“Leviathan 0
Church” 0
under 0
Pope 0
Francis. 0

A 0
more 0
simple 0
question 0
to 0
him 0
would 0
be 0
this: 0
“Are 0
you 0
refusing 0
submission 0
to 0
the 0
Roman 0
Pontiff 0
or 0
communion 0
with 0
the 0
members 0
subject 0
to 0
him?” 0

I 0

apologize 0
ahead 0
of 0
time 0
if 0
I 0
misconstrued 0
his 0
words. 0

I 0
believe, 0
though, 0
my 0
question 0
is 0
reasonable 0
in 0
light 0
of 0
his 0
reference 0
to 0
a 0
“Leviathan 0
Church” 0
distinct 0
from 0
“the 0
dictates 0
of 0
the 0
Immortal 0
God 0
in 0
heaven.” 0

If 0

Dr. 0
Fastiggi 0
wishes 0
to 0
continue 0
to 0
pretend, 0
despite 0
a 0
growing 0
mountain 0
of 0
evidence, 0
that 0
Pope 0
Francis 0
has 0
not 0
in 0
fact 0
approved 0
of 0
the 0
admission 0
of 0
public 0
adulterers 0
to 0
Holy 0
Communion--just 0
as 0
he 0
did 0
when 0
Archbishop 0
of 0
Buenos 0
Aires, 0
and 0
just 0
as 0
he 0
did 0
with 0
the 0
woman 0
he 0
telephoned 0
in 0
Argentina—then 0
I 0
cannot 0
help 0
him. 0

As 0

for 0
my 0
metaphorical 0
reference 0
to 0
a 0
“Leviathan 0
Church,” 0
I 0
am 0
afraid 0
Dr. 1
Fastiggi 1
has 1
succumbed 1
to 1
an 1
unfortunate 1
literal-mindedness. 1

To 0
make 0
it 0
clear 0
for 0
him, 0
I 0
am 0
contending 0
that 0
he 0
and 0
his 0
co-author 0
treat 0
the 0
Pope 0
as 0
if 0
he 0
were 0
the 0
absolute 0
ruler 0
of 0
Hobbes’s 0
Leviathan. 0

I 0
do 0
not, 0
as 0
should 0
be 0
obvious, 0
argue 0
that 0
this 0
Leviathan 0
Church 0
actually 0
exists. 0

That 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
and 0
cannot 0
exist 0
is 0
precisely 0
my 0
point. 0

Dr. 0

Fastiggi’s 0
inapt 0
citation 0
to 0
Canon 0
751 0
and 0
his 0
clumsy 0
and 0
insulting 0
questions 0
about 0
my 0
“standing 0
in 0
the 0
Catholic 0
Church” 0
and 0
whether 0
I 0
am 0
“refusing 0
submission 0
to 0
the 0
Roman 0
Pontiff” 0
demonstrate 1
a 1
pronounced 1
lack 1
of 1
comprehension 1
of 1
pertinent 1
ecclesiological 1
and 1
theological 1
basics, 1
and 1
a 1
rather 1
embarrassing 1
lack 1
of 1
rhetorical 1
finesse. 1

Raising 0
objections 0
to 0
a 0
papal 0
document 0
because 0
it 0
appears 0
to 0
depart 0
from 0
sound 0
orthodoxy 0
is 0
hardly 0
“refusing 0
submission 0

the 0

Pontiff,” 0
who 0
has 0
not, 0
at 0
any 0
rate, 0
actually 0
commanded 0
anyone 0
to 0

to 0
anything 0

AL. 0

I 1

respectfully 1
suggest 1
that 1
Dr. 1
Fastiggi’s 1
comments 1
evince 1
a 1
need 1
for 1
serious 1
