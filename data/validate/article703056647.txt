The 0 51 1
bubonic 0 51 1
plague 0 51 1
outbreak 0 51 1
that 0 51 1
is 0 51 1
taking 0 51 1
Madagascar 0 51 1
to 0 51 1
its 0 51 1
knees 0 51 1

than 0 51 1
likely 0 51 1
last 0 51 1
another 0 51 1
six 0 51 1
months. 0 51 1

But 0 51 2
the 0 51 2
worst 0 51 2
news 0 51 2
is 0 51 2
that 0 51 2
the 1 51 2
epidemic 1 51 2
could 1 51 2
explode 1 51 2
anytime 1 51 2
unleashing 1 51 2
the 1 51 2
sickness 1 51 2
on 1 51 2
the 1 51 2
globe. 1 51 2

At 0 51 3
least 0 51 3
128 0 51 3
people 0 51 3
have 0 51 3
been 0 51 3
killed 0 51 3
and 0 51 3
more 0 51 3
than 0 51 3
1,300 0 51 3
infected 0 51 3
by 0 51 3
the 0 51 3
deadlier 0 51 3
pneumonic 0 51 3
strain 0 51 3
of 0 51 3
the 0 51 3
medieval 0 51 3
disease. 0 51 3

But 0 51 4
the 0 51 4
oncoming 0 51 4
rainy 0 51 4
season 0 51 4
could 0 51 4
see 0 51 4
the 0 51 4
number 0 51 4
of 0 51 4
those 0 51 4
infected 0 51 4
explode 1 51 4
exponentially. 0 51 4

The 0 51 5
rainy 0 51 5
season 0 51 5
poses 0 51 5
a 0 51 5
threat 0 51 5
to 0 51 5
the 0 51 5
containment 0 51 5
of 0 51 5
the 0 51 5
plague 0 51 5
because 0 51 5
outbreaks 0 51 5
of 0 51 5
this 0 51 5
magnitude 0 51 5
often 0 51 5
seem 0 51 5
to 0 51 5
be 0 51 5
seasonal. 0 51 5

The 0 51 6
Foreign 0 51 6
Office 0 51 6
recently 0 51 6
warned 0 51 6
that 0 51 6
the 1 51 6
deadly 1 51 6
outbreak 1 51 6
is 1 51 6
entering 1 51 6
its 1 51 6
most 1 51 6
dangerous 1 51 6
phase. 1 51 6

Its 0 51 7
website 0 51 7
said 0 51 7
that 0 51 7
“outbreaks 0 51 7
of 0 51 7
plague 0 51 7
tend 0 51 7
to 0 51 7
be 0 51 7
seasonal 0 51 7
and 0 51 7
occur 0 51 7
mainly 0 51 7
during 0 51 7
the 0 51 7
rainy 0 51 7
season.” 0 51 7
The 0 51 7
African 0 51 7
island’s 0 51 7
wet 0 51 7
season 0 51 7
officially 0 51 7
began 0 51 7
today 0 51 7
and 0 51 7
will 0 51 7
last 0 51 7
until 0 51 7
the 0 51 7
end 0 51 7
of 0 51 7
April, 0 51 7
meaning 0 51 7
the 1 51 7
downward 1 51 7
trend 1 51 7
the 1 51 7
plague 1 51 7
had 1 51 7
seen 1 51 7
over 1 51 7
the 1 51 7
past 1 51 7
few 1 51 7
days, 1 51 7
will 1 51 7
likely 1 51 7
turn 1 51 7
upward 1 51 7
again. 1 51 7

Because 0 51 8
the 0 51 8
disease 0 51 8
can 0 51 8
be 0 51 8
spread 0 51 8
easily 0 51 8
through 0 51 8
a 0 51 8
cough 0 51 8
or 0 51 8
sneeze, 0 51 8
experts 0 51 8
are 0 51 8
fearful. 0 51 8

It 1 51 9
would 1 51 9
take 1 51 9
just 1 51 9
one 1 51 9

as 0 51 10
a 0 51 10
precaution. 0 51 10

The 1 51 11
outbreak 1 51 11
has 1 51 11
been 1 51 11
fueled 1 51 11
by 1 51 11
performing 1 51 11
the 1 51 11
ancient 1 51 11
practice 1 51 11
of 1 51 11
Famadihana. 1 51 11

Famadihana 0 51 12
is 0 51 12
the 0 51 12
“dancing 0 51 12
with 0 51 12
the 0 51 12
dead” 0 51 12
ritual 0 51 12

up 0 51 12

them 0 51 12
before 0 51 12
they 0 51 12

a 0 51 13
corpse 0 51 13

because 0 51 13
they 0 51 13
contracted 0 51 13
the 0 51 13
