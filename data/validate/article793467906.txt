Abedin 0
Pal, 0
Should 0
Not 0
Be 0
UN 0
Ambassador 0

President 0
Trump 0
came 0
in 0
promising 0
to 0
drain 0
the 0
swamp. 0

Dina 0
Powell 0
is 0
the 0
swamp. 1

You 0
can 0
see 0
her 0
out 0
there 0
at 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative, 0
next 0
to 0
Samantha 0
Power, 0
palling 0
around 0
with 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett 0
or 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

Dina 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
was 0
an 0
influential 0
figure 0
in 0
the 0
Bush 0
administration. 0

The 0
Egyptian-American 0
immigrant 0
had 0
served 0
as 0
a 0
gatekeeper 0
for 0
George 0
W. 0
Bush. 0

If 0
you 0
wanted 0
a 0
job, 0
you 0
went 0
through 0
her. 0

Barely 0
30, 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
more 0
power 0
than 0
many 0
of 0
the 0
big 0
Bush 0
era 0
names 0
you 0
do 0
know. 0

Then 0
she 0
took 0
on 0
the 0
mission 0
of 0
promoting 0
America 0
to 0
the 0
Muslim 0
world 0
at 0
the 0
State 0
Department. 0

There 0
were 0
cultural 0
exchanges 0
with 0
Iran 0
and 0
money 0
for 0
Lebanon 0
and 0
the 0
Palestinian 0
Authority. 0

Afterward 0
it 0
was 0
off 0
to 0
make 0
millions 0
through 0
philanthropy 0
at 0
the 0
Goldman 0
Sachs 0
Foundation. 0

Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
all 0
the 0
right 0
friends. 0

Like 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett. 0

Arianna 0
Huffington 0
praised 0
the 0
White 0
House 0
for 0
bringing 0
her 0
in. 0

Her 0
ex-husband 0
heads 0
up 0
Teneo 0
Strategy: 0
the 0
organization 0
created 0
by 0
the 0
same 0
man 0
who 0
made 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Foundation 0
happen 0
and 0
which 0
employed 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

You 0
could 0
see 0
her 0
posing 0
next 0
to 0
Huma, 0
Arianna 0
and 0
a 0
Saudi 0
princess. 0

You 0
can 0
see 0
her 0
photographed 0
at 0
the 0
American 0
Task 0
Force 0
of 0
Palestine 0
gala. 0

The 0
ATFP 0
was 0
originally 0
Rashid 0
Khalidi’s 0
American 0
Committee 0
on 0
Jerusalem. 0

Khalidi 0
was 0
the 0
former 0
PLO 0
spokesman 0
at 0
the 0
center 0
of 0
the 0
Obama 0
tape 0
scandal. 0

And 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
was 0
there 0
as 0
a 0
presenter 0
at 0
the 0
Middle 0
East 0
Institute 0
after 0
a 0
speech 0
by 0
the 0
PLO’s 0
Hanan 0
Ashrawi. 0

Unlike 0
McFarland, 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
no 0
national 0
security 0
background. 0

But 0
though 0
her 0
parents 0
were 0
Christians, 0
she 0
had 0
the 0
“right” 0
views 0
on 0
Islam. 0

In 0
Egypt, 0
she 0
had 0
described 0
how 0
Bush 0
after 0
September 0
11 0
had, 0
“visited 0
a 0
mosque, 0
took 0
off 0
his 0
shoes 0
and 0
paid 0
his 0
respects.” 0
"I 0
see 0
the 0
president 0
talk 0
of 0
Islam 0
as 0
a 0
religion 0
of 0
peace, 0
I 0
see 0
him 0
host 0
an 0
iftar 0
every 0
year.” 0
Habib 0
Powell 0
had 0
attended 0
such 0
an 0
iftar 0
dinner. 0

Habib 0
Powell 0
has 0
been 0
described 0
as 0
the 0
Republican 0
Huma 0
Abedin. 0

And 0
she 0
was 0
quoted 0
as 0
saying 0
that 0
Abedin 0
“feels 0
a 0
deep 0
responsibility 0
to 0
encourage 0
more 0
mutual 0
understanding 0
between 0
her 0
beliefs 0
and 0
culture 0
and 0
American 1
culture.” 1

And 0
Powell 0
has 0
been 0
on 0
cheerful 0
terms 0
with 0
at 0
least 0
one 0
Obama 0
unmasker. 0

And 0
with 0
Clintonworld 0
people. 0

In 0
2015, 0
Dina 0
Powell 0
– 0
President 0
Donald 0
Trump’s 0
Deputy 0
National 0
Security 0
Adviser 0
in 0
2017 0
– 0
sat 0
down 0
with 0
far 0
left-wing 0
United 0
Nations 0
Ambassador 0
Samantha 0
Power 0
for 0
an 0
interview. 0

In 0
that 0
interview, 0
Powell 0
heaped 0
effusive 0
praise 0
upon 0
Power 0
and 0
can 0
be 0
seen 0
nodding 0
in 0
agreement 0
throughout. 0

Power 0
was 0
a 0
senior 0
adviser 0
to 0
President 0
Barack 0
Obama. 0

At 0
the 0
time, 0
Powell 0
– 0
an 0
executive 0
with 0
Goldman 0
Sachs 0
– 0
was 0
pushing 0
a 0
pet 0
project 0
known 0
as 0
10,000 0
women, 0
which 0
is 0
ostensibly 0
intended 0
to 0
foster 0
female 0
entrepreneurship. 0

When 0
Powell 0
was 0
at 0
Goldman 0
Sachs, 0
her 0
right-hand 0
woman 0
in 0
the 0
10,000 0
Women 0
program 0
was 0
Noa 0
Meyer. 0

Perhaps 0
not 0
so 0
coincidentally, 0
Meyer 0
worked 0
in 0
the 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
administration’s 0
speech-writing 0
office 0
of 0
then 0
first-lady 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

Powell 0
herself, 0
is 0
very 0
comfortable 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton. 0

In 0
2013, 0
she 0
shared 0
a 0
stage 0
with 0
Hillary 0
at 0
the 0
Clinton 0
Global 0
Initiative. 0

In 0
2007, 0
Powell 0
was 0
named 0
to 0
the 0
Board 0
of 0
a 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
project 0
known 0
as 0
‘Vital 0
Voices’,another 0
women-centric 1
operation 0
that 0
touts 0
Global 0
Ambassadorial 0
missions 0
for 0
women. 0

On 0
June 0
14, 0
2016 0
Powell 0
participated 0
in 0
a 0
Summit 0
known 0
as 0
the 0
United 0
State 0
of 0
Women(USW), 0
which 0
meshed 1
nicely 1
with 0
her 0
pet 0
project. 0

USW 0
was 0
also 0
rife 0
with 0
angry 1
left-wing 1
Democrats 1
seeking 0
to 0
get 0
Hillary 0
Clinton 0
elected 0
in 0
2016. 0

In 0
fact, 0
Barack 0
Obama’s 0
closest 0
adviser 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett 0
introduced 0
Powell, 0
who 0
returned 0
the 0
introduction 0
with 0
effusive 0
praise 0
for 0
Jarrett. 0

The 0
ex-Goldman 0
Sachs 0
executive 0
has 0
befriended 0
Obama’s 0
closest 0
adviser, 0
Valerie 0
Jarrett. 0

She 0
is 0
also 0
very 0
cozy 0
with 0
Hillary 0
Clinton’s 0
closest 0
advisers 0
Huma 0
Abedin 0
and 0
Philippe 0
Reines. 0

Now 0
there's 0
once 0
again 0
talk 0
of 0
moving 0
Dina 0
Powell 0
in. 0

This 0
time 0
into 0
Nikki 0
Halley's 0
old 0
spot 0
as 0
UN 0
Ambassador. 0

The 0
talk 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
GOP 0
establishment. 0

Powell 0
should 0
not 0
be 0
at 0
the 0
NSC, 0
where 0
she 0
replaced 0
K.T. 0

McFarland, 0
who 0
was 0
qualified 0
for 0
the 0
job, 0
at 0
the 0
behest 0
of 0
H.R. 0

McMaster. 0

But 0
every 0
job 0
for 0
Powell 0
is 0
a 0
stepping 0
stone 0
to 0
the 0
next 0
one. 0

And 0
the 0
one 0
she 0
has 0
her 0
eyes 0
on 0
now 0
would 0
be 0
an 0
even 1
bigger 1
disaster. 1

Making 0
Dina 0
Powell 0
the 0
US 0
Ambassador 0
to 0
the 0
UN 0
would 0
quickly 0
undo 0
all 0
the 0
progress 0
that 0
Haley 0
made. 0

Before 0
long 0
the 0
US 0
would 0
be 0
right 0
back 0
in 0
the 0
Human 0
Rights 0
Council, 0
there 0
would 0
be 0
moves 0
in 0
favor 0
of 0
the 0
PLO, 0
and 0
the 0
same 1
old 1
failed 1
politics 1
would 0
be 0
back. 0

Haley 0
sent 0
a 0
message 0
that 0
UN 0
members 0
will 0
be 0
punished 0
if 0
they 0
push 0
the 0
US 0
around. 0

Powell 0
would 0
swiftly 1
undo 1
that. 0

Dina 0
Powell 0
would 0
have 0
been 0
a 0
Jeb 0
Bush 0
appointee. 0

Appointing 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
UN 1
would 1
give 1
Trump, 1
Jeb 1
Bush's 1
policies. 1

You 0
don't 0
drain 0
the 0
swamp 0
by 0
appointing 0
the 0
swamp. 0

And 0
Powell 0
is 0
one 1
of 1
the 1
worst 1
swamp 1
creatures 1
in 1
D.C. 1
