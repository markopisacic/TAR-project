said 0 405 43
in 0 405 43
a 0 405 43
statement 0 405 43
Tuesday 0 405 43
night 0 405 43
that 0 405 43
“the 0 405 43
Obama 0 405 43
administration 0 405 43
misled 0 405 43
the 1 405 43
American 1 405 43
people 1 405 43
and 0 405 43
Congress 0 405 43
because 0 405 43
they 0 405 43
were 0 405 43
desperate 0 405 43
to 0 405 43
get 0 405 43
a 0 405 43
deal 0 405 43
with 0 405 43
Iran.” 0 405 43

“Despite 0 405 44
claims 0 405 44
both 0 405 44
before 0 405 44
and 0 405 44
after 0 405 44
the 0 405 44
Iran 0 405 44
deal 0 405 44
was 0 405 44
completed 0 405 44
that 0 405 44
the 0 405 44
U.S. 0 405 44
financial 0 405 44
system 0 405 44
would 0 405 44
remain 0 405 44
off 0 405 44
limits, 0 405 44
the 0 405 44
Obama 0 405 44
administration 0 405 44
issued 0 405 44
a 0 405 44
specific 0 405 44
license 0 405 44
allowing 0 405 44
Iran 0 405 44
to 0 405 44
convert 0 405 44
billions 0 405 44
of 0 405 44
dollars 0 405 44
in 0 405 44
assets 0 405 44
using 0 405 44
the 0 405 44
U.S. 0 405 44
financial 0 405 44
system,” 0 405 44
Mr. 0 405 44

“The 0 405 45
only 0 405 45
reason 0 405 45
this 0 405 45
transaction 0 405 45
wasn’t 0 405 45
executed 0 405 45
was 0 405 45
because 0 405 45
two 0 405 45
U.S. 0 405 45
banks 0 405 45
refused, 0 405 45
even 0 405 45
though 0 405 45
the 0 405 45
administration 0 405 45
asked 0 405 45
them 0 405 45
to 0 405 45
help 0 405 45
convert 0 405 45
the 0 405 45
money.” 0 405 45

Such 0 405 46
sanctions, 0 405 46
he 0 405 46
added, 0 405 46
“are 0 405 46
a 0 405 46
vital 0 405 46
foreign 0 405 46
policy 0 405 46
tool, 0 405 46
and 0 405 46
the 0 405 46
U.S. 0 405 46
government 0 405 46
should 0 405 46
never 0 405 46
work 0 405 46
to 0 405 46
actively 0 405 46

enforcement 0 405 46
or 0 405 46
effectiveness.” 0 405 46
