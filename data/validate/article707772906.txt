For 0
decades, 0
Americans 0
have 0
known 0
that 0
very 1
sick 1
things 1
happen 0
behind 0
the 0
scenes 0
in 0
Washington 0
D.C., 0
but 0
the 0
mainstream 0
media 0
nearly 0
really 0
talks 0
about 0
any 0
of 0
it. 0

But 0
now 0
the 0
curtain 0
is 0
starting 0
to 0
be 0
pulled 0
back, 0
and 0
the 0
revelations 0
about 0
Al 0
Franken 0
are 0
just 0
the 0
beginning. 0

Earlier 0
this 0
week, 0
I 0
wrote 0
an 0
article 0
about 0
how 0
“sexual 1
harassment 1
is 1
rampant 1
in 1
the 1
halls 1
of 1
Congress”, 1
and 0
that 0
was 0
before 0
a 0
female 0
radio 0
anchor 0
named 0
LeeAnn 0
Tweeden 0
revealed 0
that 0
Al 0
Franken 0
had 0
“forcibly 0
kissed” 0
and 0
groped 0
her 0
during 0
a 0
USO 0
tour 0
in 0
2006. 0

The 0
following 0
comes 0
from 0
an 0
article 0
in 0
which 0
Tweeden 0
shared 0
her 0
story… 0

I 0
couldn’t 0
believe 0
it. 0

He 0
groped 0
me, 0
without 0
my 0
consent, 0
while 0
I 0
was 0
asleep. 0

I 1
felt 1
violated 1
all 1
over 1
again. 1

Embarrassed. 1

Belittled. 1

Humiliated. 1

How 0
dare 0
anyone 0
grab 0
my 0
breasts 0
like 0
this 0
and 0
think 0
it’s 0
funny? 0

I 0
told 0
my 0
husband 0
everything 0
that 0
happened 0
and 0
showed 0
him 0
the 0
picture. 0

I 0
wanted 0
to 0
shout 1
my 1
story 1
to 1
the 1
world 1
with 1
a 1
megaphone 1
to 0
anyone 0
who 0
would 0
listen, 0
but 0
even 0
as 0
angry 0
as 0
I 0
was, 0
I 0
was 0
worried 0
about 0
the 0
potential 0
backlash 0
and 0
damage 0
going 0
public 0
might 0
have 0
on 0
my 0
career 0
as 0
a 0
broadcaster. 0

But 0
that 0
was 0
then, 0
this 0
is 0
now. 0

I’m 1
no 1
longer 1
afraid. 1

When 0
the 0
story 0
initially 0
broke, 0
Franken 0
rushed 0
to 0
issue 0
an 0
apology… 0

“I 0
certainly 0
don’t 0
remember 0
the 0
rehearsal 0
for 0
the 0
skit 0
in 0
the 0
same 0
way, 0
but 0
I 0
send 0
my 0
sincerest 0
apologies 0
to 0
Leeann,” 0
said 0
Franken. 0

“As 0
to 0
the 0
photo, 0
it 0
was 0
clearly 0
intended 0
to 0
be 0
funny 0
but 0
wasn’t. 0

I 0
shouldn’t 0
have 0
done 0
it.” 0

Needless 0
to 0
say, 0
many 0
were 0
completely 1
unsatisfied 1
with 0
Franken’s 0
very 1
weak 1
statement. 1

In 0
fact, 0
some 0
members 0
of 0
his 0
own 0
party 0
said 0
that 0
his 0
apology 0
was 0
entirely 1
insufficient 1
and 0
are 0
calling 0
for 0
Franken 0
to 0
be 0
held 0
accountable 0
for 0
his 0
actions… 0

Guy 0
Cecil, 0
the 0
former 0
head 0
of 0
the 0
Democratic 0
Senatorial 0
Campaign 0
Committee 0
and 0
now 0
the 0
boss 0
of 0
a 0
leading 0
Democratic 0
super 0
PAC, 0
voiced 0
his 0
frustration 0
with 0
the 0
inadequacy 0
of 0
Franken’s 0
apology 0
on 0
Twitter. 0

“That 0
was 0
not 0
an 0
apology 0
and 0
was 0
an 0
insufficient 0
response 0
to 0
serious 0
allegations,” 0
Cecil 0
tweeted. 0

“Al 1
Franken 1
must 1
be 1
held 1
accountable 1
if 1
our 1
party 1
wants 1
to 1
live 1
up 1
to 1
our 1
commitment 1
to 1
women 1
& 1
girls.” 1

This 0
scandal 0
has 0
set 0
off 0
a 0
feeding 1
frenzy 1
as 0
Internet 0
sleuths 0
search 0
for 0
other 0
incidents 0
in 0
which 0
Franken 0
has 0
acted 0
inappropriately. 0

And 0
of 0
course, 0
since 0
we 0
are 0
talking 0
about 0
Al 0
Franken, 0
it 0
wasn’t 0
exactly 0
difficult 0
to 0
find 0
material. 0

For 0
example, 0
a 0
photo 0
has 0
surfaced 0
of 0
Franken 0
grabbing 0
Joy 0
Behar 0
in 0
a 0
very 1
creepy 1
manner. 1

The 0
following 0
comes 0
from 0
Breitbart… 0

Amid 0
the 0
emergence 0
of 0
a 0
2006 0
photo 0
of 0
Al 0
Franken 0
groping 0
journalist 0
and 0
talk 0
radio 0
anchor 0
Leeann 0
Tweeden, 0
a 0
photo 0
of 0
the 0
embattled 0
Minnesota 0
Senator 0
appearing 0
to 0
grab 0
comedian 0
Joy 0
Behar’s 0
breast 0
has 0
also 0
resurfaced. 0

Franken 0
was 0
a 0
comedian 0
before 0
he 0
ever 0
entered 0
the 0
world 0
of 0
politics, 0
and 0
we 0
understand 0
that. 0

But 0
just 0
because 0
he 0
was 0
a 0
comedian 0
does 0
not 0
mean 0
that 0
he 0
gets 0
to 0
play 0
by 0
a 0
different 0
set 0
of 0
rules. 0

There 0
appears 0
to 0
be 0
an 0
ongoing 0
pattern 0
of 0
behavior, 0
and 0
Fox 0
News 0
has 0
documented 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
other 0
incidents 0
that 0
have 0
come 0
up 0
in 0
the 0
past… 0

Franken, 0
then 0
a 0
comedian, 0
was 0
quoted 0
in 0
a 0
1995 0
New 0
York 0
Magazine 0
article 0
discussing 0
a 0
skit 0
for 0
“Saturday 0
Night 0
Live” 0
that 0
involved 0
drugging 1
and 1
raping 1
CBS 1
reporter 1
Lesley 1
Stahl. 1

Franken, 0
at 0
the 0
time 0
a 0
writer 0
for 0
“SNL,” 0
suggested 0
one 0
skit 0
should 0
play 0
out 0
with 0
“60 0
Minutes” 0
commentator 0
Andy 0
Rooney 0
finding 0
an 0
empty 0
pill 0
bottle 0
on 0
his 0
desk. 0

“’I 0
give 0
the 0
pills 0
to 0
Lesley 0
Stahl. 0

Then 0
when 0
Lesley 0
is 0
passed 0
out, 0
I 1
take 1
her 1
to 1
the 1
closet 1
and 1
rape 1
her.’ 1
Or 0
‘That’s 0
why 0
you 0
never 0
see 0
Lesley 0
until 0
February.’ 0
Or, 0
‘When 0
she 0
passes 0
out. 0

I 0
put 0
her 0
in 0
various 0
positions 0
and 0
take 0
pictures 0
of 0
her,’” 0
Franken 0
was 0
quoted 0
saying. 0

The 0
article, 0
along 0
with 0
a 0
2000 0
Playboy 0
column 0
in 0
which 0
Franken 0
talked 0
about 0
fantasizing 1
a 1
machine 1
would 1
perform 1
oral 1
sex 1
on 1
him, 1
was 0
used 0
to 0
attack 0
Franken 0
during 0
his 0
2008 0
Senate 0
campaign 0
in 0
Minnesota. 0

As 1
much 1
as 1
we 1
may 1
be 1
appalled 1
by 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
things 1
that 1
Al 1
Franken 1
has 1
done, 1
the 1
truth 1
is 1
that 1
there 1
are 1
far 1
worse 1
offenders 1
in 1
Washington. 1

Let’s 0
talk 0
about 0
Bill 0
Clinton 0
for 0
a 0
moment. 0

Democrats 0
have 0
been 0
covering 0
up 0
his 0
sexual 0
crimes 0
for 0
years, 0
and 0
my 0
hope 0
is 0
that 0
now 0
this 0
will 0
start 0
to 0
change. 0

Juanita 0
Broaddrick, 0

Hamzy, 0

Wellstone, 0

James, 0

Flowers, 0
Elizabeth 0
Ward 0
Gracen, 0
Sally 0
Perdue, 0
Lencola 0
Sullivan, 0
Susie 0
Whitacre 0
and 0
Bobbie 0
Ann 0
William 0
are 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
women 0
that 0
have 0
made 0
allegations 0
against 0
Clinton, 0
and 1
if 1
even 1
half 1
of 1
their 1
allegations 1
are 1
true 1
Clinton 1
should 1
be 1
in 1
prison 1
for 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
his 1
life. 1

In 0
my 0
article 0
yesterday, 0
I 0
discussed 0
how 0
one 0
Secret 0
Service 0
agent 0
is 0
charging 0
former 0
Vice-President 0
Joe 0
Biden 0
of 0
engaging 0
in 0
“Weinstein-level” 1
behavior, 1
and 0
I 0
also 0
talked 0
about 0
how 0
15 0
million 0
dollars 0
in 0
settlements 0
have 0
been 0
secretly 0
paid 0
out 0
to 0
victims 0
of 0
sexual 0
harassment 0
in 0
the 0
House 0
of 0
Representatives 0
in 0
recent 0
years. 0

There 1
is 1
a 1
culture 1
of 1
corruption 1
in 1
Washington 1
D.C., 1
and 1
we 1
desperately 1
need 1
to 1
drain 1
the 1
swamp. 1

If 1
you 1
agree, 1
I 1
hope 1
that 1
you 1
will 1
support 1
my 1
campaign 1
and 1
the 1
campaigns 1
of 1
other 1
anti-establishment 1
candidates 1
that 1
want 1
to 1
clean 1
up 1
the 1
halls 1
of 1
Congress. 1

It 0
is 0
time 0
to 0
take 0
our 0
government 0
back 0
because 0
at 0
this 0
point 0
it 0
has 0
become 0
an 0
absolutely 1
disgusting 1
cesspool 1
of 1
filth 1
and 1
corruption. 1
