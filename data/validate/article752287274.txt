at 0
Dulles 0
Airport 0
trying 0
to 0
fly 0
to 0
Pakistan 0
in 0
July, 0
and 0
prosecutors 0
charged 0
him 0
with 0
fraudulently 0
gathering 0
money 0
the 0
prior 0

up 0

at 0
the 0

of 0

Abid 0
then 0
used 0

When 0
his 0
father 0
died 0
on 0
Jan. 0
16, 0
2017, 0
the 0
youngest 0
Awan 0
brother, 0
Jamal, 0
attested 0
on 0
the 0
death 0
certificate 0
provided 0
to 0
the 0
insurance 0
company 0
that 0
his 0
father 0
was 0

a 0
statement 0
Gilani’s 0
lawyer 0
said 0
would 0
have 0
kept 0
her 0
from 0
the 0
money. 0

A 0
Virginia 0

later 0
ruled 0
that 0
Jamal’s 0
statement 0
about 0
his 0
marital 0
status 0
on 0
the 0
certificate 0
was 0
wrong. 0

“Why 1

Bacon 0
said 0
of 0

misstatement 0
at 0

March 0

date. 0

On 0
Dec. 0

Imran 0
and 0
Alvi 0
– 0
who 0
was 0
also 0
on 0
the 0
House 0

– 0
began 0
taking 0
a 0
series 0
of 0
withdrawals 0
from 0

some 0
of 0
which 0
federal 0

Jan. 0

according 0
to 0

On 0
Jan. 0
17, 0
Abid 0
filed 0
notarized 0
papers 0
using 0
those 0
rights 0
to 0
replace 0
Gilani 0
with 0
himself 0
as 0
beneficiary. 0

The 0
life 0
insurance 0
change’s 0
timing 0
seems 0
to 0
coincide 0
with 0
other 0
moves 0
by 0
Abid 0
to 0
liquidate 0
property 0
and 0
transfer 0
it. 0

Ten 0
weeks 0
prior, 0
on 0
Nov. 0
1, 0
2016, 0
Alvi 0
sold 0
a 0
house 0
to 0
Jamal 0
for 0
$620,000, 0
netting 0
another 0
significant 0
profit 0
from 0
the 0
mortgage 0
company. 0

In 0
addition 0
to 0
his 0
primary 0
residence, 0
Abid 0
owned 0
the 0
house 0
where 0
his 0
mother 0

stepfather 0
lived, 0
and 0
moved 0
in 0
after 0
his 0
death, 0
with 0
Gilani 0
becoming 0
homeless. 0

Abid 0
owned 0
two 0
homes 0
despite 0
a 0
$1 0
million 0
2012 0
bankruptcy 0
that 0
might 0
ordinarily 0
have 0
forced 0
him 0
to 0
sell 0
the 0
second 0
home 0
to 0
pay 0
creditors. 0

At 0
that 0
time, 0
he 0
filed 0
forms 0
“under 0
penalty 0
of 0
perjury” 0
that 0
two 0
houses 0
were 0
needed 0
as 0
“my 0
spouse 0

I 0
are 0
legally 0

applicable 0
non-bankruptcy 0
law 0

my 0

I 0
are 0

evading 0

However, 0

Nataliia 0
Sova 0
– 0
who 0
also 0
was 0
on 0
the 0

on 0
the 0
2016 0

“spouse 0
of 0

and 0
they 0
have 0

living 0
together. 0

Gilani 0

TheDCNF 0
the 0
brothers 0
were 0
trying 0
to 0
use 0
the 0

giving 0

to 0
“assets 0

which 0
were 0

valuable 0
than 0
the 0
$50,000 0
policy. 0

Americo, 0
the 0
life 0

said 0
there 0
was 0
“great 1

about 0

14, 0
two 0

the 0
House 0
sargent-at-arms 0
banned 0
the 0
Awans 0
for 0
“suspicious 0

Gilani 0
alleged 0
the 0
brothers 0
took 0
her 0
financial 0
documents, 0
a 0
laptop, 0
and 0
her 0
husband’s 0
possessions. 0

The 0
only 0
lawyer 0
she 0
could 0
afford, 0
she 0
claimed, 0
was 0
Michael 0
Hadeed, 0
a 0

who 0
was 0
convicted 0
in 0
2010 0
of 0

for 0
two 0
years, 0
according 0
to 0

Hadeed 1
did 1
not 1
introduce 1
any 1
evidence 1
to 1
the 1
judge 1
about 1
a 1
pattern 1
of 1
possible 1
fraud 1
by 1
Abid, 1
the 1
timing 1
of 1
the 1
move 1
as 1
it 1
relates 1
to 1
the 1
federal 1
criminal 1
case, 1
or 1
the 1
mental 1
capacity 1
of 1
the 1
dying 1
man 1
to 1
understand 1
paperwork. 1

Hadeed 0
withdrew 0
earlier 0
allegations 0
of 0
fraud 0
and 0
asked 0
the 0
judge 0
to 0
try 0
the 0
case 0
based 0
solely 0
on 0
interpretation 0
of 0
contract 0
language. 0

After 0
court, 0
Hadeed 0
told 0
reporters 0
Bacon 0
had 0
threatened 0
to 0
sue 0
him 0
for 0
defamation. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
subject 0
myself 0
to 0
that,” 0
he 0
said 0
outside 0
court. 0

“I 0
don’t 0
want 0
to 0
get 0
myself 0
in 0
a 0
lawsuit 0
over 0
this.” 0

In 0
court, 0
Bacon 0
badgered 0
Hadeed. 0

“Are 0
you 0
going 0
to 0
share 0
any 0
more 0
info 0
with 0
them? 0

I 0
hope 0
not. 0

I 0
hope 0
you 0
learned 0
that 0
lesson,” 0
he 0
said. 0

“You 1
have 1
no 1
control 1
over 1
[Gilani], 1
do 1
you? 1

You’re 0
like, 0
talking 1
to 1
a 1
wall,” 1
he 0
said 0
of 0
Gilani. 0

Hadeed 0
said 0
three 0
different 0
signatures 0
from 0
Abid 0
on 0
financial 0
documents 0
did 0
not 0
match, 0
and 0
put 0
a 0
defiant 0
Abid 0
on 0
the 0
witness 0
stand. 0

Hadeed: 0
Why 1
do 1
your 1
signatures 1
look 1
different? 1

Abid: 0
My 0
signatures 0
are 0
not 0
very 0
consistent, 0
I’m 1
just 1
a 1
human 1
being… 1

Hadeed: 0
You 0
were 0
aware 0
you 0
were 0
changing 0
beneficiary 0
from 0
your 0
father’s 0
spouse 0
to 0
yourself? 0

Abid: 0
That 0
was 0
my 0
father’s 0
request… 0

Hadeed: 0
You’re 0
not 0
answering 0
the 0
question. 0

Abid: 0
I’m 0
not 0
very 0
smart, 0
so 0
it 0
takes 0
a 0
while 0
sometimes… 0

Judge: 0
I 1
don’t 1
understand 1
why 1
the 1
witness 1
is 1
having 1
such 1
trouble 1
with 1
the 1
question. 1

Your 0
job 0
is 0
to 0
answer 0
the 0
question. 0

In 0
court 0
documents, 0
Gilani 0
alleged, 0
“while 0
he 0
was 0
admitted 0
in 0
hospital 0
my 0
telephone 0
conversations 0
were 0
taped 0
and 0
some 0
other 0
recording 0
devices 0
were 0
also 0
installed/planted 0
in 0
my 0
house 0
… 0
Imran 0
Awan 0
showed 0
up 0
and 0
threatened 0
me 0
for 0
me 0
calling 0
the 0
police. 0

[Imran] 0
threatened 1
that 1
he 1
is 1
very 1
powerful 1
and 0
if 1
I 1
ever 1
call 1
the 1
police 1
again 1
[he] 1
will 1
do 1
harm 1
to 1
me.” 1
She 0
said 0
that 0
Imran 0
eventually 0
agreed 0
to 0
remove 0
the 0
listening 0
devices 0
and 0
did 0
so 0
in 0
front 0
of 0
her. 0

Based 0
on 0
Hadeed’s 0
narrow 0
legal 0
argument 0
about 0
the 0
life 0
insurance 0
contract’s 0
language, 0
the 0
judge 0
ruled 0
that, 0
“The 0
son 0
as 0
the 0
owner 0
of 0
the 0
policy 0
has 0
the 0
absolute 0
right 0
to 0
change 0
the 0
beneficiary.” 0

After 0
Gilani 0
retained 0
a 0
lawyer, 0
Bacon 0
had 0
offered 0
a 0
settlement 0
where 0
they’d 0
split 0
the 0
money, 0
but 0
Gilani 0
declined 0
it. 0

The 0
court 0
awarded 0
Abid 0
the 0
$50,000 0
life 0
insurance 0
payout, 0
minus 0
$5,000 0
that 0
the 0
insurance 0
company 0
took 0
for 0
its 0
expenses 0
in 0
litigating 0
the 0
fraud 0
allegations. 0

“You 0
should 0
have 0
taken 0
the 0
settlement. 0

Now 0
she’s 0
not 0
getting 0
a 0
penny,” 0
Bacon 0
said 0
in 0
court. 0

“You’re 0
not 0
getting 0
anything.” 0

Gilani 0
said 0
after 0
court 0
that 0
her 0
conscience 0
didn’t 0
allow 0
her 0
to 0
settle. 0

“I 0
didn’t 0
do 0
the 0
deal 0
because 0
they 0
had 0
been 0
adopting 0
bad 0
behaviors. 0

I 0
cannot 0
agree 0
to 0
that. 0

It 0
wasn’t 0
about 0
the 0
money,” 0
she 0
said. 0
