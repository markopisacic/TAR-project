on 0 347 1
Thursday 0 347 1
announced 0 347 1
the 0 347 1
findings 0 347 1
of 0 347 1
a 0 347 1
search 0 347 1
warrant 0 347 1
they 0 347 1
executed 0 347 1

the 0 347 1
home 0 347 1
of 0 347 1
Botham 0 347 1

after 0 347 1
he 0 347 1
was 0 347 1
gunned 0 347 1
down 0 347 1
in 0 347 1

The 0 347 2
department 0 347 2
is 0 347 2
now 0 347 2
accused 0 347 2
of 0 347 2
trying 0 347 2
to 0 347 2
“smear” 1 347 2
Jean 0 347 2
by 0 347 2
claiming 0 347 2
they 0 347 2
found 0 347 2
a 0 347 2
tiny 1 347 2
bit 1 347 2
of 0 347 2
marijuana 0 347 2
in 0 347 2
his 0 347 2
house—as 0 347 2
if 0 347 2
this 0 347 2
justifies 0 347 2
going 0 347 2
into 0 347 2
someone’s 0 347 2
home 0 347 2
and 0 347 2
murdering 0 347 2
them. 0 347 2

The 0 347 3
timing 0 347 3
couldn’t 0 347 3
have 0 347 3
been 0 347 3
more 0 347 3
insidiously 0 347 3
planned 0 347 3
as 0 347 3
police 0 347 3
released 0 347 3
the 0 347 3
affidavit 0 347 3
on 0 347 3
the 0 347 3
day 0 347 3
of 0 347 3
Jean’s 0 347 3
funeral—despite 0 347 3
having 0 347 3
allegedly 0 347 3
found 0 347 3
the 0 347 3
marijuana 0 347 3
last 0 347 3
week. 0 347 3

According 0 347 4
to 0 347 4
the 0 347 4
affidavit, 0 347 4
when 0 347 4
they 0 347 4
searched 0 347 4
his 0 347 4
home, 0 347 4
police 0 347 4
claimed 0 347 4
to 0 347 4
have 0 347 4
found 0 347 4
10.4 0 347 4
grams 0 347 4
of 0 347 4
pot—less 0 347 4
than 0 347 4
half 0 347 4
an 0 347 4
ounce. 0 347 4

Police 0 347 5
also 0 347 5
said 0 347 5
they 0 347 5

a 0 347 5
metal 0 347 5
marijuana 0 347 5
grinder—the 0 347 5
horror. 1 347 5

Even 1 347 6
if 1 347 6
police 1 347 6
did 1 347 6
find 1 347 6
marijuana, 1 347 6
why 1 347 6
on 1 347 6

be 0 347 22
correct 0 347 22
in 0 347 22
his 0 347 22

It 0 347 23
is 0 347 23
standard 0 347 23

Even 0 347 24
sadder, 0 347 24
however, 0 347 24
is 0 347 24
the 0 347 24

what 0 347 34
“verbal 0 347 34
commands” 0 347 34
she 0 347 34
gave. 0 347 34

What’s 0 347 35
more, 0 347 35
any 0 347 35
verbal 0 347 35
commands 0 347 35
she 0 347 35
did 0 347 35
give 0 347 35
were 0 347 35
entirely 0 347 35
irrelevant 0 347 35
as 0 347 35
she 0 347 35
was 0 347 35
the 0 347 35
intruder—not 0 347 35
Jean. 0 347 35

Attempting 0 347 36
to 0 347 36
imply 0 347 36
that 0 347 36
Jean 0 347 36
was 0 347 36
somehow 0 347 36
at 0 347 36
fault 0 347 36
for 0 347 36
his 0 347 36
own 0 347 36
death 0 347 36
for 0 347 36
disobeying 0 347 36
the 0 347 36
commands 0 347 36
of 0 347 36
a 0 347 36
homicidal 1 347 36
cop 1 347 36
who’d 0 347 36
just 0 347 36
illegally 0 347 36
broken 0 347 36
into 0 347 36
his 0 347 36
home 0 347 36
is 0 347 36
as 0 347 36
irresponsible 0 347 36
as 0 347 36
it 0 347 36
is 0 347 36
reprehensible. 0 347 36

What’s 0 347 37
more, 0 347 37
according 0 347 37
to 0 347 37
the 0 347 37
attorneys 0 347 37
for 0 347 37
Jean, 0 347 37
when 0 347 37
Guyger 0 347 37
was 0 347 37
on 0 347 37
the 0 347 37
phone 0 347 37
with 0 347 37
police, 0 347 37
she 0 347 37
had 0 347 37
to 0 347 37
go 0 347 37
outside 0 347 37
to 0 347 37
verify 0 347 37
the 0 347 37
address 0 347 37
of 0 347 37
the 0 347 37
apartment—implying 0 347 37
that 0 347 37
she 0 347 37
knew 0 347 37
she 0 347 37
was 0 347 37
in 0 347 37
the 0 347 37
wrong 0 347 37
apartment 0 347 37
from 0 347 37
the 0 347 37
start. 0 347 37

“From 0 347 38
the 0 347 38
fact 0 347 38
that 0 347 38
when 0 347 38
you 0 347 38
look 0 347 38
at 0 347 38
an 0 347 38
affidavit 0 347 38
and 0 347 38
I’m 0 347 38
thinking 0 347 38
that 0 347 38
I’m 0 347 38
at 0 347 38
my 0 347 38
house 0 347 38
and 0 347 38
I 0 347 38
call 0 347 38
911 0 347 38
because 0 347 38
someone 0 347 38
was 0 347 38
just 0 347 38
shot,” 0 347 38
Attorney 0 347 38
Daryl 0 347 38
Washington 0 347 38
said. 0 347 38

“Well, 0 347 39
the 0 347 39
very 0 347 39
first 0 347 39
thing 0 347 39
that 0 347 39
I’m 0 347 39
going 0 347 39
to 0 347 39
do 0 347 39
is 0 347 39
I’m 0 347 39
not 0 347 39
going 0 347 39
to 0 347 39
go 0 347 39
outside 0 347 39
and 0 347 39
look 0 347 39
at 0 347 39
my 0 347 39
address? 0 347 39

I’m 0 347 40
going 0 347 40
to 0 347 40
give 0 347 40
them 0 347 40
my 0 347 40

right 0 347 40
there 0 347 40
on 0 347 40
the 0 347 40

I’m 0 347 41
going 0 347 41
to 0 347 41
say 0 347 41
I’m 0 347 41
on 0 347 41
the 0 347 41
phone. 0 347 41

My 0 347 42
address 0 347 42
is 0 347 42
this. 0 347 42

Why 0 347 43
did 0 347 43
she 0 347 43
have 0 347 43
to 0 347 43
go 0 347 43
outside 0 347 43
to 0 347 43
verify 0 347 43
the 0 347 43
address? 0 347 43

It 0 347 44
makes 0 347 44
no 0 347 44
sense 0 347 44
whatsoever.” 0 347 44

Even 0 347 45
more 0 347 45
ominous 1 347 45
than 0 347 45
having 0 347 45
to 0 347 45
verify 0 347 45
the 0 347 45
address 0 347 45
is 0 347 45
the 0 347 45
fact 0 347 45
that 0 347 45
according 0 347 45
to 0 347 45
witnesses, 0 347 45
Guyger’s 0 347 45
story 0 347 45
of 0 347 45
inserting 0 347 45
the 0 347 45
key 0 347 45
into 0 347 45
Jean’s 0 347 45
door 0 347 45
and 0 347 45
it 0 347 45
opening 0 347 45
up 0 347 45
was 0 347 45
simply 0 347 45
not 0 347 45
true. 0 347 45

According 0 347 46
to 0 347 46
witnesses, 0 347 46
Guyger 0 347 46
was 0 347 46
banging 0 347 46
on 0 347 46
Jean’s 0 347 46
door, 0 347 46
demanding 0 347 46
he 0 347 46
let 0 347 46
her 0 347 46
in. 0 347 46

“Independent 0 347 47

pounding 0 347 47
on 0 347 47
the 0 347 47
door 0 347 47
and 0 347 47
demanding 0 347 47
to 0 347 47
be 0 347 47
let 0 347 47
in,” 0 347 47
Lee 0 347 47
Merritt, 0 347 47
one 0 347 47
of 0 347 47
the 0 347 47
attorneys 0 347 47
representing 0 347 47
the 0 347 47
Jean 0 347 47
family, 0 347 47
told 0 347 47
ABC 0 347 47
News. 0 347 47

“The 0 347 48
contradictions 0 347 48
begin 0 347 48
to 0 347 48
build 0 347 48
from 0 347 48
there.” 0 347 48

The 0 347 49
doors 0 347 49
in 0 347 49
the 0 347 49
complex 0 347 49
are 0 347 49

equipped 0 347 49
with 0 347 49
an 0 347 49
automatic 0 347 49
closing 0 347 49
mechanism. 0 347 49

This 0 347 50
was 0 347 50
demonstrated 0 347 50
by 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
attorneys 0 347 50
who 0 347 50
opened 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
door 0 347 50
and 0 347 50
released 0 347 50
it 0 347 50
several 0 347 50
times—showing 0 347 50
that 0 347 50
it 0 347 50
closed 0 347 50
every 0 347 50
single 0 347 50
time—blowing 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
claim 0 347 50
that 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
door 0 347 50
was 0 347 50
somehow 0 347 50
ajar 0 347 50
completely 0 347 50
out 0 347 50
of 0 347 50
the 0 347 50
water. 0 347 50

Jean’s 0 347 51
family 0 347 51
also 0 347 51
pointed 0 347 51
out 0 347 51
that 0 347 51
it 0 347 51
would 0 347 51
have 0 347 51
been 0 347 51
incredibly 0 347 51
unlikely 0 347 51
for 0 347 51
Guyger 0 347 51
to 0 347 51
mistake 0 347 51
Jean’s 0 347 51
apartment 0 347 51
for 0 347 51
her 0 347 51

distinct 0 347 51
red 0 347 51
door 0 347 51
mat 0 347 51
which 0 347 51
would 0 347 51
have 0 347 51
been 0 347 51
enough 0 347 51
for 0 347 51
the 0 347 51
cop 0 347 51
to 0 347 51
know 0 347 51
she 0 347 51
was 0 347 51
at 0 347 51
the 0 347 51
wrong 0 347 51
place. 0 347 51

Even 0 347 54
as 0 347 54
cops 0 347 54
come 0 347 54
to 0 347 54
Guyger’s 0 347 54
defense 0 347 54
and 0 347 54
attempt 0 347 54
to 0 347 54
shame, 0 347 54
smear, 1 347 54
and 0 347 54
discredit 0 347 54
her 0 347 54
victim—who 0 347 54
was 0 347 54
an 0 347 54
upstanding 1 347 54
member 1 347 54
of 1 347 54
society 1 347 54
regardless 0 347 54
of 0 347 54

plant 0 347 54
they 0 347 54
claim 0 347 54
to 0 347 54
have 0 347 54
found—they 0 347 54
are 0 347 54
failing 0 347 54
miserably. 1 347 54

Despite 0 347 55
cops 0 347 55
rallying 0 347 55
behind 0 347 55
the 0 347 55
blue 0 347 55

cop, 1 347 55
the 0 347 55
rest 0 347 55
of 0 347 55
the 0 347 55
country 0 347 55

not 0 347 55
buying 0 347 55
it. 0 347 55

In 0 347 56
a 0 347 56

writer 0 347 56
Kashana 0 347 56

of 0 347 56
the 0 347 56

quite 0 347 56
succinctly. 0 347 56

In 0 347 57

to 0 347 57
cops 0 347 57
claiming 0 347 57
to 0 347 57

a 0 347 57
tiny 0 347 57
bit 0 347 57
of 0 347 57
