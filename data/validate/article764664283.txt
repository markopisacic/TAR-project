‘The 0
Religion 0
of 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
Is 0
a 0
Religion 0
of 0
Peace’ 0

Outside 0
of 0
specialists 0
and 0
seekers, 0
the 1
only 1
reason 1
why 1
there 1
is 1
general 1
interest 1
in 1
the 1
Qur’an 1
among 1
non-Muslims 1
is 1
to 1
seek 1
an 1
answer 1
to 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
whether 1
or 1
not 1
it 1
justifies 1
and 1
encourages 1
Islamic 1
terrorism. 1

With 0
What 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
Meant: 0
And 0
Why 0
It 0
Matters, 0
religion 0
author 0
Garry 0
Wills 0
is 0
here 0
to 0
reassure 0
us: 0

What 0
did 0
the 0
scripture 0
of 0
Islam 0
tell 0
me 0
about 0
the 1
duty 1
to 1
kill 1
infidels? 1

Some 0
people 0
are 0
sure 0
it 0
is 0
there, 0
though 0
it 0
isn’t. 0

Then 0
what 0
does 0
it 0
say 0
about 0
Shari’ah 0
law? 0

Not 0
a 0
thing 0
(p. 0
7). 0

That 1
would 1
be 1
good 1
to 1
know, 1
were 1
Wills 1
a 1
reliable 1
witness. 1

Unfortunately, 1
he 1
proves 1
to 1
be 1
just 1
the 1
opposite: 1
Wills 0
laments 0
“Robert 0
Spencer 0
of 0
Jihad 0
Watch 0
calling 0
for 0
a 0
ban 0
on 0
the 0
Qur’an” 0
(p. 0
58). 0

I 0
have 0
never 0
called 0
for 0
such 0
a 0
ban, 0
and 0
oppose 0
in 0
principle 0
the 0
banning 0
of 0
any 0
book. 0

Wills, 1
not 1
surprisingly, 1
does 1
not 1
offer 1
any 1
quotation 1
from 1
me 1
to 1
back 1
up 1
his 1
false 1
claim. 1

His 0
manifest 0
unreliability 0
on 0
this 0
point 0
casts 0
a 0
shadow 0
on 0
his 0
primary 0
assertions 0
about 0
the 0
Qur’an. 0

Wills 0
seems 0
determined 0
to 0
put 0
the 1
best 1
possible 1
face 1
on 1
the 1
Qur’an, 1
which 0
requires 0
him 0
to 0
ignore 0
a 0
great 0
deal 0
of 0
Qur’anic 0
incitement 1
and 1
hatred. 1

For 0
example, 0
he 0
quotes 0
5:51 0
-- 0
“You 0
who 0
believe, 0
do 0
not 0
take 0
the 0
Jews 0
and 0
Christians 0
as 0
allies” 0
(p. 0
114) 0
-- 0
but 0
he 0
nonetheless 0
concludes, 0
after 0
ten 0
pages 0
of 0
tu 1
quoque 1
arguments 1
and 0
other 0
legerdemain, 1
that 0
“the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
fraternal 0
in 0
its 0
treatment 0
of 0
other 0
faiths” 0
(p. 0
124). 0

Wills 1
never 1
mentions 1
Qur’an 1
9:29, 1
which 1
commands 1
Muslims 1
to 1
wage 1
war 1
against 1
Jews 1
and 1
Christians 1
and 1
subjugate 1
them 1
as 1
inferiors 1
under 1
the 1
rule 1
of 1
Sharia. 1

Wills 1
is 1
no 1
more 1
trustworthy 1
when 1
he 1
deals 1
with 1
the 1
question 1
of 1
violence 1
in 1
the 1
Qur’an. 1

He 0
renders 0
one 0
key 0
passage 0
in 0
this 0
way: 0
“Fight 0
then 0
until 0
there 0
is 0
no 0
more 0
persecution, 0
and 0
worship 0
[at 0
the 0
shrine] 0
is 0
devoted 0
to 0
God” 0
(2:193; 0
p. 0
133). 0

Whence 0
the 0
bracketed 0
interpolation 0
“at 0
the 0
shrine”? 0

Wills 1
doesn’t 1
give 1
any 1
source 1
for 1
it; 1
apparently 0
it 0
comes 0
from 0
none 0
other 0
than 0
Garry 0
Wills 0
himself. 0

By 0
adding 0
“at 0
the 0
shrine” 0
to 0
this 0
verse, 0
Wills 0
restricts 0
the 0
call 0
to 0
fight 0
to 0
the 0
area 0
around 0
the 0
Sacred 0
Mosque 0
in 0
Mecca. 0

He 1
ignores 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
some 1
Islamic 1
authorities 1
see 1
this 1
passage 1
as 1
calling 1
for 1
nothing 1
less 1
than 1
unlimited 1
warfare 1
against 1
non-Muslims. 1

The 0
prominent 0
Twentieth 0
Century 0
Indian 0
Islamic 0
scholar 0
Muhammad 0
Ashiq 0
Ilahi 0
Bulandshahri 0
explains 0
the 0
passage 0
this 0
way: 0

The 0
worst 1
of 1
sins 1
are 0
Infidelity 0
( 0
Kufr) 0
and 0
Polytheism 0
( 0
shirk) 0
which 0
constitute 0
rebellion 0
against 0
Allah, 0
The 0
Creator. 0

To 1
eradicate 1
these, 1
Muslims 1
are 1
required 1
to 1
wage 1
war 1
until 1
there 1
exists 1
none 1
of 1
it 1
in 1
the 1
world, 1
and 1
the 1
only 1
religion 1
is 1
that 1
of 1
Allah. 1

Wills 1
doesn’t 1
mention 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
such 1
interpretations, 1
even 1
to 1
dismiss 1
them. 1

Likewise, 1
when 1
he 1
claims 1
that 1
the 1
Qur’an 1
has 1
“not 1
a 1
thing” 1
to 1
say 1
about 1
Sharia, 1
he 1
appears 1
unaware 1
that 1
the 1
Qur’an 1
is 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
sources 1
of 1
Sharia. 1

The 0
Qur’an’s 0
declarations 0
that 0
a 0
woman’s 0
testimony 0
is 0
worth 0
half 0
that 0
of 0
a 0
man’s 0
(2:282), 0
that 0
a 0
daughter 0
is 0
to 0
receive 0
a 0
smaller 0
part 0
of 0
an 0
inheritance 0
than 0
a 0
son 0
receives 0
(4:11), 0
that 0
thieves 0
are 0
to 0
have 0
their 0
hands 0
amputated 0
(5:38), 0
and 0
that 0
those 0
who 0
“wage 0
war 0
against 0
Allah 0
and 0
his 0
messenger” 0
are 0
to 0
be 0
crucified 0
or 0
have 0
a 0
hand 0
and 0
foot 0
amputated 0
on 0
opposite 0
sides 0
(5:33) 0
are 0
part 0
of 0
Sharia 0
in 0
all 0
its 0
various 0
expressions. 0

Because 0
these 0
stipulations 0
are 0
found 0
in 0
the 0
Qur’an, 0
they 0
cannot 0
be 0
questioned 0
or 0
set 0
aside. 0

Throughout 0
his 0
book, 0
Wills’ 0
assurances 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
not 0
really 0
as 0
bad 0
as 0
“right-wing 1
Islamophobes” 1
say, 0
or 0
that 0
the 1
Bible 1
contains 1
material 1
that 1
is 1
just 1
as 1
bad 1
or 1
worse, 1
dissolve 0
under 0
close 0
scrutiny. 0

Again 1
and 1
again 1
it 1
turns 1
out 1
that 1
Wills 1
has 1
ignored 1
key 1
passages 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
make 1
his 1
case. 1

He 0
asks 0
why 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
“so 1
ferocious 1
to 0
‘hypocrites’ 1
and 0
apostates” 0
(p. 0
124). 0

Then 0
he 0
offers 0
a 0
quotation 0
from 0
the 0
New 0
Testament 0
Letter 0
to 0
the 0
Hebrews 0
saying 0
that 0
“if 0
we 0
sin 0
again 0
on 0
purpose” 0
there 0
is 0
“only 0
a 1
terrifying 1
judgment 1
to 0
come” 0
(p. 0
126). 0

Wills 0
concludes: 0
“The 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
not 0
as 0
absolute 0
as 0
this, 0
because 0
it 0
always 0
leaves 0
room 0
for 0
God’s 0
inexhaustible 1
mercy 1
and 1
forgiveness” 1
(p. 0
126). 0

That 1
sounds 1
wonderful, 1
and 0
certainly 0
pleasing 0
to 0
multicultural 0
ears 0
to 0
learn 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
is 0
more 0
merciful 0
than 0
the 0
New 0
Testament. 0

Until 0
one 0
realizes 0
that, 0
in 0
his 0
discussion 0
of 0
apostasy 0
in 0
the 0
Qur’an, 0
Wills 1
has 1
omitted 1
all 1
mention 1
of 1
the 1
primary 1
Qur’anic 1

to 1

and 0
then 0
turning 0

God’s 1

indeed. 1

Wills’ 0
peaceful 1
fantasy 1
Qur’an 0
raises 0
one 1
massive 1
question 1
that 0
the 0
author 0
does 0
not 0
and 0
cannot 0
answer: 0
if 1
the 1
Islamic 1
holy 1
book 1
is 1
really 1
as 1
peaceful 1
and 1
benign 1
as 1
Garry 1
Wills 1
makes 1
it 1
out 1
to 1
be, 1
why 1
do 1
so 1
very 1
many 1
Muslims 1
worldwide 1
misunderstand 1
it? 1

The 1
Islamic 1
State 1
(ISIS), 1

its 1
heyday, 1

the 1
Qur’an 1
frequently 1
-- 0
odd 0

or 0

One 0
Malaysian 0
Muslim 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
led 0
him 0
to 0
join 0

State. 0

A 0
Muslima 0
in 0

promoted 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State 0
by 0
quoting 0
the 0
Qur’an. 0

An 0
Islamic 0
State 0
propagandist’s 0
parents 0
said 0
of 0
him: 0
“Our 0
son 0
is 0
a 0
devout 0
Muslim. 0

He 0
had 0
learnt 0
the 0
Quran 0
by 0
heart.” 0
A 0
Muslim 0
politician 0
from 0
Jordan 0
said 0
that 0
the 0
Islamic 0
State’s 0
“doctrine 0
stems 0
from 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
and 0
Sunnah.” 0

How 1
would 1
Garry 1
Wills 1
explain 1
all 1
that? 1

He 1
can’t; 1
he 0
has 0
just 0
explained 0
all 0
Qur’anic 0
violence 1
and 0
intolerance 0
away, 0
leaving 0
the 0
manifest 0
fact 0
that 0
all 0
too 0
many 0
Muslims 0
worldwide 0
think 0
that 0
the 0
Qur’an 0
says 0
exactly 0
what 0
he 0
claims 0
it 0
does 0
not 0
say 0
an 0
unanswered 0
conundrum. 0

Wills’ 1
naïve, 1
inaccurate, 1
misleadingly 1
sunny 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
Qur’an, 1
of 0
course, 0
accords 0
with 0
that 0
of 0
his 0
fellow 0
Leftist 1
Catholic, 1
Pope 1
Francis. 1

Francis 0
has 0
proclaimedpreposterously 1
that 0
“authentic 0
Islam 0
and 0
the 0
proper 0
reading 0
of 0
the 0
Koran 0
are 0
opposed 0
to 0
every 0
form 0
of 0
violence.” 0
Wills’ 0
book 0
accords 0
well 0
with 0
the 0
present-day 0
Catholic 0
Church’s 0
head-in-the-sand 1
posture 1
toward 1
Qur’an-based 1
Islamic 1
jihad 1
violence 1
and 0
the 0
Muslim 0
persecution 0
of 0
the 0
ancient 0
Christian 0
communities 0
of 0
the 0
Middle 0
East. 0

It 1
isn’t 1
remotely 1
accurate, 1
but 1
it 1
feels 1
good, 1
and 1
for 1
the 1
Catholic 1
and 1
Leftist 1
establishment 1
today, 1
that 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
all 1
that 1
matters. 1
